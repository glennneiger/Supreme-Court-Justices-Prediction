mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
may
i
say
that
that
is
not
the
only
error
that
the
government
has
made
in
this
case.
i
submit
that
they
are
attempting
to
mislead
this
court,
not
only
as
to
basic
facts
that
are
involved
but
also
as
to
proper
interpretation
of
the
statute.
i
think
it
might
be
best
if
i
started
out
by
pointing
out
that
mr.
allen
generes
was
not
a
mere
investor,
as
that
term
has
been
used
by
this
court
and
as
the
government
has
used
it
here.
there
is
no
dispute
whatsoever
that
allen
h.
generes
had
as
a
trade
or
business
being
a
corporate
executive
for
a
salary.
the
government
stipulated
to
that
fact
with
me
at
the
trial
of
this
case
and
it
is
in
the
record.
so
we
have
stipulated
that
he
had
been
serving
the
corporation
and
receiving
a
salary
as
a
trade
or
business.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
that
is
in
the
pretrial
order,
your
honor,
in
the
pretrial
order
that
is
issued.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
i
do
not
recall
it
right
now.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
we
have
also
agreed
that
it
was
stipulated
with
this
that
the
taxpayer
may
have
more
than
one
trade
or
business.
as
mr.
generes
did
have,
he
was
the
president
of
central
savings
and
loan
association,
for
which
he
also
received
a
salary.
the
point
here
is
that
he
rendered
services
to
this
corporation.
he
received
a
salary
of
some
$12,000
a
year.
he
was
not
a
majority
shareholder,
he
only
owned
44%
of
the
stocks
in
his
corporation
and
no
conclusions
i
submit
can
be
drawn
from
the
fact
that
his
son-in-law
happened
to
be
also
an
owner
of
44%
of
the
stock.
the
son-in-law
had
a
separate
different
business
prior
to
the
early
1940's
when
these
two
men
form
the
partnership
together
and
when
they
incorporated,
they
each
owned
the
same
amount
of
stock
but
they
rendered
different
services,
they
received
different
salaries
and
mr.
generes
did
render
services
and
the
only
evidence
in
the
record
is
that
the
investment
in
this
corporation
was
$38,900.
now
the
government
--
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
no,
there
is
not
your
honor.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
the
evidence
is
that
mr.
generes
deducted
$38,900
in
the
year
that
the
corporation
went
under
asset
capital
loss.
that
was
his
investment
in
the
corporation,
that
is
the
only
evidence
in
the
record
and
the
government
had
the
opportunity
to
introduce
such
evidence
if
it
wanted
too.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
yes,
but
we
acknowledged
that
that
was
the
proper
value.
we
never
had
any
question
about
that,
as
a
practical
matter.
what
you
really
get
down
to
here
is
that
over
a
number
of
years,
this
company
was
in
the
contracting
business
and
you
are
talking
about
a
very
unique
kind
of
business,
you
are
talking
about
a
business
that
was
engaged
in
municipal
public
works
contract
for
which
they
had
to
have
payment
and
performance
bonds
and
i
have
in
testimony
introduced
of
the
vice-president
of
maryland
casualty
company,
by
a
local
insurance
agent.
all
of
them
testified,
we
will
not
grant
payment
in
performance
bonds
to
small
corporations
without
the
personal
endorsement
of
the
principal
officers
of
those
corporations.
as
a
result
of
this,
allen
generes
and
his
son-in-law
william
f.
kelly
agreed
to
indemnify
the
bonding
company
for
writing
bonds
for
the
corporations.
it
was
the
only
way
the
corporation
could
have
gotten
bonds
and
the
only
way
the
corporation
could
have
stayed
in
business.
and
consequently
over
a
number
of
years
this
was
done.
finally
in
1958,
a
blanket
indemnity
agreement
was
executed
and
this
is
why
you
talk
about
two
million
dollar
exposure.
the
government
is
strongest
scarecrow,
i
mention
here,
when
i
say,
“look
he
is
endorsing
--
why
would
he
expose
himself
to
two
million
dollars
worth
of
liability
for
a
simple
$12,000
a
year?”
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
you
are
not
really
exposing
yourself
to
anything
like
two
million
dollars
worth
of
liability.
this
meant
merely
that
maryland
would
bond
contracts
which
aggregated
a
contract
price
of
two
million
dollars.
that
meant
the
corporation
had
contracts
to
perform.
it
meant
there
would
be
money
paid
on
those
contracts.
there
would
be
retainage,
there
will
be
stage
payments.
mr.
generes
would
only
be
liable
to
maryland.
if
the
corporation
did
not
perform
the
contracts
and
if
the
amount
of
retainage
that
was
left
in
the
contract
was
insufficient
to
pay
maryland
off
and
then
you
had
all
the
assets
of
the
corporations
to
go
against
before
mr.
generes
would
become
liable.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
i
did
your
honor.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
your
honor,
i
submit
that
we
are
entitled
to
prevail
on
the
governments
instruction
and
i
contended
throughout,
that
this
was
his
dominant
motivation
--
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
by
the
government,
it
is
absolutely
not.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
that
is
correct.
at
the
time
this
case
was
tried
you
had
the
waddell
decision
from
the
second
circuit
which
had
said,
in
a
majority
opinion
that
is
significant
motivation
was
the
proper
test.
and
judge
alvin
rubin
who
was
i
think,
and
i
submit
to
this
court,
one
of
the
most
respected
judges
in
the
country
in
the
field
of
tax
laws,
believe
that
the
waddell
decision
was
correct
and
so
instructed
the
jury.
in
fact,
it
is
very
interesting
if
you
read
that
complete
charge,
you
will
find
that
that
charge
lasted
over
one
hour.
there
are
some
4500
words
in
it.
almost
every
charge
the
government
submitted
to
that
jury,
most
of
them
unfavorable
to
the
taxpayer
where
used
examples
and
illustrations
of
business
bad
debts
were
given
to
the
jury
taken
directly
from
the
governments
requested
charges,
they
have
picked
one
word
in
one
paragraph
from
an
hour
long
jury
trial
and
they
have
ceased
on
that
to
submit
that
there
is
reversible
error
here.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
4500.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
that
is
just
a
position
your
honor.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
i
think
that
significant
motivation
is
a
proper
test
to
apply
and
i
submit
that
it
is
the
only
workable
test
under
the
statute
and
that
what
the
government
is
asking
and
the
what
the
solicitor
general
was
asking
you
to
do
is
to
rewrite
section
166
of
the
internal
revenue
code
as
they
wish
it
had
been
written
instead
of
as
it
was
written.
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
if
you
look
at
the
statute
itself,
you
find
that
prior
to
the
1954
code,
you
had
only
one
definition
of
business
bad
debt
and
that
was
a
debt
that
was
incurred
in
the
trade
or
business.
that
is
the
language
of
the
statute,
the
1939
code
said
the
debt
must
be
incurred
in
the
trade
or
business.
then
in
1954,
you
have
section
166
amended
and
you
have
a
new
section
added.
the
old
language
that
a
debt
which
is
incurred
in
the
taxpayer’s
trade
or
business
is
kept
and
a
new
test
is
also
given
and
that
is
in
page
36
of
the
petitioners
brief,
the
statute
decided
which
says
and
it
is
a
backhanded
wording,
i
submit
that
is
one
of
the
problems.
it
defines
non-business
bad
debt
and
it
says,
it
is
any
debt
other
than
a
debt
created
or
acquired
as
the
case
may
be
in
connection
with
a
trade
or
business
of
the
taxpayer
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
you
have
got
to
look
at
those
words
in
connection
with
a
trade
or
business.
that
does
not
require
the
direct
relationship
that
a
loss
incurred
in
the
trade
or
business
would
require.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
i
think
so
your
honor,
i
submit
to
you
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
should
have
said
primarily
in
connection
with
the
trade
or
business
if
that
is
what
they
had
intended.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
your
honor,
i
submit
the
regulations
are
correct
because
the
regulation
say
that
they
interpret
in
connection
with
to
mean
there
must
be
a
proximate
relationships.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
we
do
quarrel
with
that.
we
had
no
quarrel
with
the
use
of
the
word
proximate,
i
think
i
could
not
do
so
this
court
has
inferentially
approved
the
test
of
proximate
relationship,
i
think
your
honor--
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
absolutely
not,
i
hope
you
have
a
--
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
i
think
not.
no,
this
case
has
not
been
before
this
court
before.
it
has
been
before
three
circuits.
i
think
this
point
has
not
been
before
the
court.
my
point
here
is
that
the
proximate,
as
this
court
has
inferentially
approved
that
i
think
perfectly
proper.
then
the
question
is
what
do
you
mean
by
proximate
and
i
would
say
that
a
significant
relationship
will
be
proximate
and
that
is
the
basis
of
the
argument.
you
have
got
a
statute
which
if
congress
had
so
intended,
it
might
easily
have
said
a
debt
created
or
acquired
primarily
in
connection
with
a
trade
or
business,
that
would
have
resolved
the
matter,
i
could
not
be
here
arguing
the
significant
motivation
test
if
congress
have
said
that.
what
the
solicitor
general
is
attempting
to
do
is
to
amend
a
statute
by
inserting
a
word
that
congress
itself
did
not
put
in.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
provided
the
business
reason
bares
this
is
a
significant
relationship.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
that
is
correct
but
i
would
submit
that
there
is
a
significant
relationship
in
the
business
relationship
area
that
gives
rise
to
a
business
bad
debt
and
if
congress
did
not
intend
that
result,
all
congress
had
to
do
was
say
primarily
in
connection
with
and
that
would
have
ended
the
matter
and
they
have
done
that
in
other
section
of
the
code.
this
court
has
interpreted
other
of
the
section
to
the
code
as
for
example
with
the
capital
assets,
we
talked
about
primarily
for
sale
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business
and
the
court
is
interpreted
the
word
primarily
and
that
would
have
put
it
in
to
the
matter
here
but
when
they
say
in
connection
with,
this
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
issued
its
own
regulations
and
used
the
word
proximate.
i
said
that
is
what
is
meant
here,
a
proximate
relationship.
and
then
of
course
they
get
annoyed
when
the
courts
look
at
the
word
proximate
and
as
the
second
circuit
did
and
as
the
fifth
circuit
did,
they
see
that
there
is
an
analogy
in
the
tort
law,
they
have
not
drawn
on
the
tort
law
but
we
know
that
you
may
have
more
than
one
proximate
clause
and
all
that
we
are
talking
about
there
is
certain
nearness,
a
certain
importance.
the
point
here
is
that
this
will
not
give
rise
to
baseless
deductions.
you
cannot
blame
a
business
bad
debt
unless
there
is
a
significant
relationship
between
the
loss
or
the
debt
and
the
employees’
trade
or
business.
and
i
would
submit
that
that
test
is
just
as
easy
if
not
easier
to
apply
by
juries
and
i
think
it
is
more
flexible.
it
is
fairer
to
the
taxpayer
and
it
is
fairer
to
everyone.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
only
i
think
inferentially
your
honor
because
he
had
as
one
trade
or
business,
that
of
being
president
of
central
savings
and
loan
association.
he
had
another
trade
or
business
--
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
mr.
justice
marshall,
if
i
may
have,
i
guess
i
would
have
to
depart
from
the
record
but
this
man
had
to
go
out
and
mortgage
everything
he
owned
in
order
to
come
up
with
his
money
at
the
end.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
your
honor
that
would
be
somewhat
misleading
because
what
happened
was
that
in
1962
of
the
end
of
the
game
really
--
this
corporation
which
had
been
having
millions
of
dollars
of
business
every
year,
in
1962,
they
seriously
under
bid
two
major
contracts
and
the
corporation
became
default
--
they
defaulted
on
those
contracts
and
maryland
stepped-in
in
order
to
try
to
bail
out
the
corporation
and
to
salvage
the
operation.
then
in
1962
mr.
generes
made
loans
to
the
corporation
of
a
very
substantial
amount,
you
are
right.
he
tried
to
salvage
the
corporation
at
a
time
when
it
was
going
under
and
i
submit
that
is
a
big
difference.
there
you
are
talking
about
loans
to
the
corporation
and
mr.
generes
deducted
those
as
nonbusiness
bad
debts
because
he
loaned
them
to
them
and
the
last
year
at
a
time
when
the
corporation
was
going
under.
what
we
are
talking
about
in
this
case
is
not
a
loan
to
the
corporation,
it
never
was
and
it
is
misleading
if
we
try
to
think
of
it
as
a
loan
of
a
corporation.
this
was
an
agreement
to
a
bonding
company
to
personally
indemnify
that
bonding
company,
if
the
bonding
company
would
write
bonds
for
the
corporation.
in
other
words
you
started
back
years
early.
in
order
to
stay
in
business
and
in
order
to
have
a
going
business
you
needed
bonds
as
a
fact
of
life
in
the
construction
business.
kelly-generes
construction
company
could
not
get
jobs,
if
it
could
not
get
payment
in
performance
bonds
and
it
could
not
get
payment
and
performance
bonds
without
the
personal
endorsements
of
allen
h.
generes
and
william
f.
kelly
and
as
a
result,
generes
and
kelly
both
agreed
to
maryland
we
will
personally
indemnify,
that
is
not
a
loan
to
the
corporation
and
the
issue
in
the
case
was
in
executing
the
agreement
to
indemnify
the
bonding
company,
what
was
generes’s
motivation?
now,
the
trail
judge
charged
this
jury
that
there
are
number
of
factors
that
they
should
consider
and
only
one
was
the
motivation
but
the
test
has
now
boiled
down
and
got
into
this
court
is
when
he
executed
that
indemnity
agreement
agreeing
to
indemnify
maryland
so
that
the
corporation
could
get
bonds
and
go
as
a
growing
concern,
he
was
probably
was
significantly
motivated
by
the
desire
to
protect
his
trade
or
business
as
a
salaried
option.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
they
never
would
have
been
any
necessity
for
him
to
sign
indemnity
agreements
with
maryland
because
then
as
a
partner
he
would
have
been
personally
involved.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
as
a
partner
or
in
a
corporation
your
honor?
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
again,
he
would
not
been
personally
allowed.
as
a
partnership,
there
would
have
been
a
necessity.
he
can
find
the
partnership
and
he
as
a
partner
would
have
been
bound.
that
raises
very
sticky
points
and
i
apologize
for
this,
that
the
case
arises
from
louisiana
and
we
have
the
civil
law
system
and
not
the
common
law
which
does
creates
in
problems
that
i
would
rather
not.
i
will
be
happy
to
discuss
the
problems
of
partnership
law
in
louisiana
but
we
make
distinctions
that
are
not
made
in
the
other
states.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
i
think
that
is
correct
your
honor.
but
again,
we
do
not
have
all
of
mr.
generes’
tax
returns
in
the
record
of
his
salary,
his
total
income
aggregated
about
$40000
per
year.
the
man
had
formed
simple
savings
and
loan
association
in
the
1930's
and
had
always
been
the
president
and
general
manager
and
he
always
had
a
good
salary
from
that.
he
had
been
in
the
contracting
business
long
before
he
ever
set
up
kelly-generes
construction
company.
he
started
out
in
the
contracting
business,
he
had
many
years
of
experience
on
it
then
he
formed
the
partnership
with
his
son-in-law
in
the
1940's
during
world
war
ii
and
had
been
only
in
1954
that
they
actually
incorporate.
and
at
that
point
he
became
the
owner
at
44%,
at
that
stage
of
the
game,
the
investment
in
the
corporation
was
$38900
and
i
think
in
order
to
find
out
what
the
value
of
that
investment
was
and
eight
years
later,
you
would
have
to
look
at
all
of
the
corporate
returns
and
see
what
income
the
corporation
had
generated
and
so
forth.
it
could
require
a
massive
amount
of
work
which
we
have
not
gotten
into
it
at
this
point.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
in
the
sense
that
he
would
have
to
take
into
consideration
that
he
would
pay
ordinary
income
tax
on
his
salary,
i
think
that
is
correct.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
yes,
we
do
your
honor.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
but
it
is
a
very
nominal
income
tax,
i
think
it
is
2%
and
in
--
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
he
was
82
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
he
found
it
a
very
high
premium
i
had
submit
here
your
honor.
but
the
main
point
is
that
the
initial
investment
was
only
$38000—
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
that
is
correct.
there
is
actually
no
way
of
knowing
the
exact
amount
of
the
investment
as
of
1962
but
the
point
is
that
you
have
got
a
continuing
indemnity
agreement,
i
might
submit
that
would
cast
some
light
on
this
that
starting
at
the
outset
in
1954,
at
the
time
the
initial
investment
was
made,
the
bonding
companies
were
then
requiring
personal
endorsements
and
what
happened
was
that
every
time
kelly-generes
got
a
bond
or
bid
on
a
job
and
they
had
a
job
available
to,
and
they
needed
a
bond,
allen
generes
and
bill
kelly
went
to
maryland
casualty
and
got
a
bid
of
bond
and
they
personally
agreed
to
indemnify
maryland
casualty
company
and
it
was
found
that
that
was
very
inconvenient
and
as
a
result
in
1958,
a
blanket
indemnity
agreement
was
executed
so
that
you
did
not
to
keep
going
to
maryland
with
each
job
that
was
bid.
the
corporation
did
have
assets,
we
can
not
deny
it,
there
is
testimony
in
the
record
that
would
give
some
indication
there
that
there
were
some
substantial
assets
but
that
these
where
mortgaged
up
to
the
hilt.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
it
does,
there
were
no
dividends
paid.
this
corporation
never
paid
a
dividend
ever
since--
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
that
is
correct,
it
was
a
closely
held
corporation,
that
did
have
the
son-in-law,
then
they
were
other
son-on-laws
who
had
about
12%,
i
think
it
is
the
stock
of
the
corporation
but
throughout
its
history,
the
corporation
never
paid
a
dividend
but
it
did
pay
his
salary
and
it
paid
the
salary
every
year
and
there
are
some
years,
in
fact
the
record
does
show,
that
there
were
some
years
when
the
corporation
operated
at
a
deficit.
and
i
think
over
a
$40000
dollar
deficit
of
one
year
projected,
continued
to
pay
these
salaries.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
that
is
correct
but
none
of
those
tax
returns
are
in
the
record
your
honor.
and
it
was
only
incorporated
in
1954.
we
do
not
know
what
it
did
--
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
no,
but
the
main
point
is
there
was
no
return
here
to
this
man
that
is
the
kind
of
return
that
is
peculiar
to
an
investor
--
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
it
would
be,
he
was
receiving
a
salary
every
year
and
this
is
what
he
testified
--
primarily
motivated,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
testified
that
was
his
sole
motivation
when
he
did
it
and
there
was
testimony
by
other
parties
that
would
support
that
but
i
would
submit
that
in
concluding,
your
honor,
that
even
under
a
dominant
motivation
test
as
the
government
argues
that
allen
h.
generes
was
predominantly
motivated
to
protect
that
salary
the
he
was
receiving
of
$12000
a
year
and
i
think
that
the
important
question
--
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor,
but
i
would
submit
that
the
important
point
for
this
court
is
the
interpretation
of
section
166
of
the
internal
revenue
code
and
there
is
where
you
get
down
the
question
of
whether
the
significant
motivation
is
the
proper
test
or
whether
the
dominant
motivation
is
the
proper
test
and
for
the
reasons
set
forth
in
our
brief
and
primarily
because
congress
itself
did
not
save
primarily
in
connection
with
the
trade
or
business
but
simply
in
connection
with
the
trade
or
business
which
the
commissioner
says
and
as
this
court
has
inferentially
approved,
there
must
only
be
a
proximate
relationship
and
i
submit
just
as
there
maybe
more
than
one
cause,
a
man
may
have
more
than
one
motive.
you
will
not
necessarily
find
that
it
is
going
to
be
easier
for
juries
to
sit
down
and
weigh
a
man's
motivations
and
decide
which
is
the
dominant
and
which
is
the
less
dominant
anymore.
so
it
maybe
much
easier
to
look
at
one
motive
and
decide
is
it
significant
or
is
it
not
significant
and
you
are
not
going
to
be
opening
the
doors
to
baseless
deductions
by
simply
saying
the
in
connection
with
requirement
means
that
there
must
be
a
significant
relationship.
juries
do
not
have
that
much
problem
with
the
meaning
of
the
word
significant
and
i
would
submit
that
means
important
and
they
would
know
i
think
it
would
be
just
as
easy
to
determine
between
significant
and
insignificant
motivations
as
it
maybe
to
try
to
weigh
on
a
scale,
the
difference
between
a
dominant
motive
and
a
less
dominant
motive.
for
those
reasons,
i
submit
to
this
court
that
the
trial
judges
charged
to
the
jury
was
imminently
fair
and
must
imminently
appropriate
and
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
proper
and
i
urge
the
affirmance
of
the
court
of
appeal’s
decision.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
i
do
not
know.
it
is
very
interesting,
that
government
made
the
point
that
if
you
adopt
the
significant
motivation
test,
the
government
is
going
to
lose
every
one
of
its
cases
and
everybody
would
get
a
business
bad
debt
deduction
and
in
the
very
case,
they
decided
the
waddell
case,
the
taxpayer
lost
because
taxpayer
could
not
prove
a
significant
motivation
to
protect
--
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
the
seventh
circuit
--
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
that
is
correct,
the
seventh
circuit
in
subsequent
to
the--
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
there
have
been
any
number
of
other
cases,
in
fact
i
might
say
to
this
court
that
the
generes
case
which
we
are
now
arguing
to
you
has
been
noted
in
three
law
reviews
since
it
has
been
decided.
it
just
came
out,
since
our
briefs
were
written
and
we
had
to
submit
memos,
if
the
court
wants.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
i
do
not
think
so.
under
either
theory,
the
taxpayer
could
not
win
and
that
of
course
may
very
well
happen
if
this
court
approves
a
significant
motivation
test.
but
even
under
significant,
if
you
cannot
prove
the
significant
relationship
then
the
taxpayer
cannot
prevail
even
on
that
matter.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
i
did
not
argue
the
waddell
case
your
honor
and
i
was
not
privy
to
all
but
it
transpired
in
the
case
so
i
would
not
want
to
take
that
position
but
i
would
submit
that
the
reasoning
of
the
majority
opinion
in
the
waddell
case
is
very
persuasive
and
i
think
it
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
it
is
right
here
with
me,
your
honor.
you
want
the
one
that's
in
texas
tech
university
law
reviews
at
volume
two,
number
two,
beginning
at
page
318.
the
other
is
in
the
university
of
florida
law
review
and
i
am
sorry,
this
does
not
have
the
law
review
--
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
i
might
say
that
they
can
split
the
same
way
the
circuits
have
but
as
again,
they
have
gone
2:1
saying
that
the
generes
case
was
properly
decided
by
the
courts
below.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
i
see
no,
it
is
a
page
document—
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
yes,
i
think.
i
do
not
say
that
there
would
be
a
significant
difference
between
the
two.
“in
the
course
of”
i
think
it
shows
a
directness
that
“in
connection
with”
does
not
have,
just
as
here
in
section
166;
you
have
an
a
and
the
b.
the
b
says,
a
debt
which
is
“incurred
in.”
when
you
have
an
“incurred
in,”
there
is
a
directness
that
i
think
is
not
the
same
as
when
you
say
a
debt
created
or
acquired
“in
connection
with”
a
trade
or
business.
i
would
submit
that
by
doing
that
congress
is
saying,
it
does
not
have
to
be
directly
incurred
in
the
business.
the
relationship,
as
the
commissioner
interpreted
that
must
be
proximate
and
then
the
question
is
commissioner
did
not
define
proximate
and
we
have
to
come
along
and
define
it.
that
is
basically
what
the
trial
judge
charged
the
jury
on
that
there
must
be
a
proximate
relationship
and
i
would
submit
just
as
in
tort
law
whether
there
maybe
more
than
one
proximate
cause,
here
there
maybe
more
than
one
motivation
and
what
you
are
looking
at
is
the
significant
motivation.
i
think
and
if
the
business
relationship
between
the
taxpayer’s
act,
the
debt
and
the
loss,
if
there
is
a
significant
relationship
between
that
debt
and
the
trade
or
business
of
the
taxpayer
then
i
submit
that
under
166
as
written,
the
taxpayer
is
entitled
to
a
business
bad
debt
deduction
and
if
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
disapproves
of
that,
he
wants
them
to
have
the
predominant
test
or
the
dominant
motivation
then
they
should
go
to
congress
and
get
congress
to
amend
section
166
and
say
a
debt
created
or
acquired
as
the
case
maybe
primarily
in
connection
with
the
trade
or
business.
that
would
have
resolved
the
point
and
i
would
not
have
the
nerve
to
argue
a
significant
motivation
test
to
the
court
if
congress
had
put
in
the
word
'primarily'
as
they
have
in
many
other
sections
of
the
code.
but
they
did
not
put
it
in
and
the
solicitor
general
wants
you
to
put
it
in
for
them.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
thank
you
very
much
your
honor,
it
is
been
a
pleasure
and
a
privilege
for
me
to
appear
before
the
court.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
may
i
say
that
that
is
not
the
only
error
that
the
government
has
made
in
this
case.
i
submit
that
they
are
attempting
to
mislead
this
court,
not
only
as
to
basic
facts
that
are
involved
but
also
as
to
proper
interpretation
of
the
statute.
i
think
it
might
be
best
if
i
started
out
by
pointing
out
that
mr.
allen
generes
was
not
a
mere
investor,
as
that
term
has
been
used
by
this
court
and
as
the
government
has
used
it
here.
there
is
no
dispute
whatsoever
that
allen
h.
generes
had
as
a
trade
or
business
being
a
corporate
executive
for
a
salary.
the
government
stipulated
to
that
fact
with
me
at
the
trial
of
this
case
and
it
is
in
the
record.
so
we
have
stipulated
that
he
had
been
serving
the
corporation
and
receiving
a
salary
as
a
trade
or
business.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
that
is
in
the
pretrial
order,
your
honor,
in
the
pretrial
order
that
is
issued.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
i
do
not
recall
it
right
now.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
we
have
also
agreed
that
it
was
stipulated
with
this
that
the
taxpayer
may
have
more
than
one
trade
or
business.
as
mr.
generes
did
have,
he
was
the
president
of
central
savings
and
loan
association,
for
which
he
also
received
a
salary.
the
point
here
is
that
he
rendered
services
to
this
corporation.
he
received
a
salary
of
some
$12,000
a
year.
he
was
not
a
majority
shareholder,
he
only
owned
44%
of
the
stocks
in
his
corporation
and
no
conclusions
i
submit
can
be
drawn
from
the
fact
that
his
son-in-law
happened
to
be
also
an
owner
of
44%
of
the
stock.
the
son-in-law
had
a
separate
different
business
prior
to
the
early
1940's
when
these
two
men
form
the
partnership
together
and
when
they
incorporated,
they
each
owned
the
same
amount
of
stock
but
they
rendered
different
services,
they
received
different
salaries
and
mr.
generes
did
render
services
and
the
only
evidence
in
the
record
is
that
the
investment
in
this
corporation
was
$38,900.
now
the
government
--
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
no,
there
is
not
your
honor.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
the
evidence
is
that
mr.
generes
deducted
$38,900
in
the
year
that
the
corporation
went
under
asset
capital
loss.
that
was
his
investment
in
the
corporation,
that
is
the
only
evidence
in
the
record
and
the
government
had
the
opportunity
to
introduce
such
evidence
if
it
wanted
too.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
yes,
but
we
acknowledged
that
that
was
the
proper
value.
we
never
had
any
question
about
that,
as
a
practical
matter.
what
you
really
get
down
to
here
is
that
over
a
number
of
years,
this
company
was
in
the
contracting
business
and
you
are
talking
about
a
very
unique
kind
of
business,
you
are
talking
about
a
business
that
was
engaged
in
municipal
public
works
contract
for
which
they
had
to
have
payment
and
performance
bonds
and
i
have
in
testimony
introduced
of
the
vice-president
of
maryland
casualty
company,
by
a
local
insurance
agent.
all
of
them
testified,
we
will
not
grant
payment
in
performance
bonds
to
small
corporations
without
the
personal
endorsement
of
the
principal
officers
of
those
corporations.
as
a
result
of
this,
allen
generes
and
his
son-in-law
william
f.
kelly
agreed
to
indemnify
the
bonding
company
for
writing
bonds
for
the
corporations.
it
was
the
only
way
the
corporation
could
have
gotten
bonds
and
the
only
way
the
corporation
could
have
stayed
in
business.
and
consequently
over
a
number
of
years
this
was
done.
finally
in
1958,
a
blanket
indemnity
agreement
was
executed
and
this
is
why
you
talk
about
two
million
dollar
exposure.
the
government
is
strongest
scarecrow,
i
mention
here,
when
i
say,
“look
he
is
endorsing
--
why
would
he
expose
himself
to
two
million
dollars
worth
of
liability
for
a
simple
$12,000
a
year?”
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
you
are
not
really
exposing
yourself
to
anything
like
two
million
dollars
worth
of
liability.
this
meant
merely
that
maryland
would
bond
contracts
which
aggregated
a
contract
price
of
two
million
dollars.
that
meant
the
corporation
had
contracts
to
perform.
it
meant
there
would
be
money
paid
on
those
contracts.
there
would
be
retainage,
there
will
be
stage
payments.
mr.
generes
would
only
be
liable
to
maryland.
if
the
corporation
did
not
perform
the
contracts
and
if
the
amount
of
retainage
that
was
left
in
the
contract
was
insufficient
to
pay
maryland
off
and
then
you
had
all
the
assets
of
the
corporations
to
go
against
before
mr.
generes
would
become
liable.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
i
did
your
honor.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
your
honor,
i
submit
that
we
are
entitled
to
prevail
on
the
governments
instruction
and
i
contended
throughout,
that
this
was
his
dominant
motivation
--
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
by
the
government,
it
is
absolutely
not.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
that
is
correct.
at
the
time
this
case
was
tried
you
had
the
waddell
decision
from
the
second
circuit
which
had
said,
in
a
majority
opinion
that
is
significant
motivation
was
the
proper
test.
and
judge
alvin
rubin
who
was
i
think,
and
i
submit
to
this
court,
one
of
the
most
respected
judges
in
the
country
in
the
field
of
tax
laws,
believe
that
the
waddell
decision
was
correct
and
so
instructed
the
jury.
in
fact,
it
is
very
interesting
if
you
read
that
complete
charge,
you
will
find
that
that
charge
lasted
over
one
hour.
there
are
some
4500
words
in
it.
almost
every
charge
the
government
submitted
to
that
jury,
most
of
them
unfavorable
to
the
taxpayer
where
used
examples
and
illustrations
of
business
bad
debts
were
given
to
the
jury
taken
directly
from
the
governments
requested
charges,
they
have
picked
one
word
in
one
paragraph
from
an
hour
long
jury
trial
and
they
have
ceased
on
that
to
submit
that
there
is
reversible
error
here.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
4500.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
that
is
just
a
position
your
honor.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
i
think
that
significant
motivation
is
a
proper
test
to
apply
and
i
submit
that
it
is
the
only
workable
test
under
the
statute
and
that
what
the
government
is
asking
and
the
what
the
solicitor
general
was
asking
you
to
do
is
to
rewrite
section
166
of
the
internal
revenue
code
as
they
wish
it
had
been
written
instead
of
as
it
was
written.
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
if
you
look
at
the
statute
itself,
you
find
that
prior
to
the
1954
code,
you
had
only
one
definition
of
business
bad
debt
and
that
was
a
debt
that
was
incurred
in
the
trade
or
business.
that
is
the
language
of
the
statute,
the
1939
code
said
the
debt
must
be
incurred
in
the
trade
or
business.
then
in
1954,
you
have
section
166
amended
and
you
have
a
new
section
added.
the
old
language
that
a
debt
which
is
incurred
in
the
taxpayer’s
trade
or
business
is
kept
and
a
new
test
is
also
given
and
that
is
in
page
36
of
the
petitioners
brief,
the
statute
decided
which
says
and
it
is
a
backhanded
wording,
i
submit
that
is
one
of
the
problems.
it
defines
non-business
bad
debt
and
it
says,
it
is
any
debt
other
than
a
debt
created
or
acquired
as
the
case
may
be
in
connection
with
a
trade
or
business
of
the
taxpayer
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
you
have
got
to
look
at
those
words
in
connection
with
a
trade
or
business.
that
does
not
require
the
direct
relationship
that
a
loss
incurred
in
the
trade
or
business
would
require.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
i
think
so
your
honor,
i
submit
to
you
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
should
have
said
primarily
in
connection
with
the
trade
or
business
if
that
is
what
they
had
intended.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
your
honor,
i
submit
the
regulations
are
correct
because
the
regulation
say
that
they
interpret
in
connection
with
to
mean
there
must
be
a
proximate
relationships.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
we
do
quarrel
with
that.
we
had
no
quarrel
with
the
use
of
the
word
proximate,
i
think
i
could
not
do
so
this
court
has
inferentially
approved
the
test
of
proximate
relationship,
i
think
your
honor--
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
absolutely
not,
i
hope
you
have
a
--
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
i
think
not.
no,
this
case
has
not
been
before
this
court
before.
it
has
been
before
three
circuits.
i
think
this
point
has
not
been
before
the
court.
my
point
here
is
that
the
proximate,
as
this
court
has
inferentially
approved
that
i
think
perfectly
proper.
then
the
question
is
what
do
you
mean
by
proximate
and
i
would
say
that
a
significant
relationship
will
be
proximate
and
that
is
the
basis
of
the
argument.
you
have
got
a
statute
which
if
congress
had
so
intended,
it
might
easily
have
said
a
debt
created
or
acquired
primarily
in
connection
with
a
trade
or
business,
that
would
have
resolved
the
matter,
i
could
not
be
here
arguing
the
significant
motivation
test
if
congress
have
said
that.
what
the
solicitor
general
is
attempting
to
do
is
to
amend
a
statute
by
inserting
a
word
that
congress
itself
did
not
put
in.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
provided
the
business
reason
bares
this
is
a
significant
relationship.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
that
is
correct
but
i
would
submit
that
there
is
a
significant
relationship
in
the
business
relationship
area
that
gives
rise
to
a
business
bad
debt
and
if
congress
did
not
intend
that
result,
all
congress
had
to
do
was
say
primarily
in
connection
with
and
that
would
have
ended
the
matter
and
they
have
done
that
in
other
section
of
the
code.
this
court
has
interpreted
other
of
the
section
to
the
code
as
for
example
with
the
capital
assets,
we
talked
about
primarily
for
sale
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business
and
the
court
is
interpreted
the
word
primarily
and
that
would
have
put
it
in
to
the
matter
here
but
when
they
say
in
connection
with,
this
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
issued
its
own
regulations
and
used
the
word
proximate.
i
said
that
is
what
is
meant
here,
a
proximate
relationship.
and
then
of
course
they
get
annoyed
when
the
courts
look
at
the
word
proximate
and
as
the
second
circuit
did
and
as
the
fifth
circuit
did,
they
see
that
there
is
an
analogy
in
the
tort
law,
they
have
not
drawn
on
the
tort
law
but
we
know
that
you
may
have
more
than
one
proximate
clause
and
all
that
we
are
talking
about
there
is
certain
nearness,
a
certain
importance.
the
point
here
is
that
this
will
not
give
rise
to
baseless
deductions.
you
cannot
blame
a
business
bad
debt
unless
there
is
a
significant
relationship
between
the
loss
or
the
debt
and
the
employees’
trade
or
business.
and
i
would
submit
that
that
test
is
just
as
easy
if
not
easier
to
apply
by
juries
and
i
think
it
is
more
flexible.
it
is
fairer
to
the
taxpayer
and
it
is
fairer
to
everyone.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
only
i
think
inferentially
your
honor
because
he
had
as
one
trade
or
business,
that
of
being
president
of
central
savings
and
loan
association.
he
had
another
trade
or
business
--
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
mr.
justice
marshall,
if
i
may
have,
i
guess
i
would
have
to
depart
from
the
record
but
this
man
had
to
go
out
and
mortgage
everything
he
owned
in
order
to
come
up
with
his
money
at
the
end.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
your
honor
that
would
be
somewhat
misleading
because
what
happened
was
that
in
1962
of
the
end
of
the
game
really
--
this
corporation
which
had
been
having
millions
of
dollars
of
business
every
year,
in
1962,
they
seriously
under
bid
two
major
contracts
and
the
corporation
became
default
--
they
defaulted
on
those
contracts
and
maryland
stepped-in
in
order
to
try
to
bail
out
the
corporation
and
to
salvage
the
operation.
then
in
1962
mr.
generes
made
loans
to
the
corporation
of
a
very
substantial
amount,
you
are
right.
he
tried
to
salvage
the
corporation
at
a
time
when
it
was
going
under
and
i
submit
that
is
a
big
difference.
there
you
are
talking
about
loans
to
the
corporation
and
mr.
generes
deducted
those
as
nonbusiness
bad
debts
because
he
loaned
them
to
them
and
the
last
year
at
a
time
when
the
corporation
was
going
under.
what
we
are
talking
about
in
this
case
is
not
a
loan
to
the
corporation,
it
never
was
and
it
is
misleading
if
we
try
to
think
of
it
as
a
loan
of
a
corporation.
this
was
an
agreement
to
a
bonding
company
to
personally
indemnify
that
bonding
company,
if
the
bonding
company
would
write
bonds
for
the
corporation.
in
other
words
you
started
back
years
early.
in
order
to
stay
in
business
and
in
order
to
have
a
going
business
you
needed
bonds
as
a
fact
of
life
in
the
construction
business.
kelly-generes
construction
company
could
not
get
jobs,
if
it
could
not
get
payment
in
performance
bonds
and
it
could
not
get
payment
and
performance
bonds
without
the
personal
endorsements
of
allen
h.
generes
and
william
f.
kelly
and
as
a
result,
generes
and
kelly
both
agreed
to
maryland
we
will
personally
indemnify,
that
is
not
a
loan
to
the
corporation
and
the
issue
in
the
case
was
in
executing
the
agreement
to
indemnify
the
bonding
company,
what
was
generes’s
motivation?
now,
the
trail
judge
charged
this
jury
that
there
are
number
of
factors
that
they
should
consider
and
only
one
was
the
motivation
but
the
test
has
now
boiled
down
and
got
into
this
court
is
when
he
executed
that
indemnity
agreement
agreeing
to
indemnify
maryland
so
that
the
corporation
could
get
bonds
and
go
as
a
growing
concern,
he
was
probably
was
significantly
motivated
by
the
desire
to
protect
his
trade
or
business
as
a
salaried
option.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
they
never
would
have
been
any
necessity
for
him
to
sign
indemnity
agreements
with
maryland
because
then
as
a
partner
he
would
have
been
personally
involved.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
as
a
partner
or
in
a
corporation
your
honor?
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
again,
he
would
not
been
personally
allowed.
as
a
partnership,
there
would
have
been
a
necessity.
he
can
find
the
partnership
and
he
as
a
partner
would
have
been
bound.
that
raises
very
sticky
points
and
i
apologize
for
this,
that
the
case
arises
from
louisiana
and
we
have
the
civil
law
system
and
not
the
common
law
which
does
creates
in
problems
that
i
would
rather
not.
i
will
be
happy
to
discuss
the
problems
of
partnership
law
in
louisiana
but
we
make
distinctions
that
are
not
made
in
the
other
states.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
i
think
that
is
correct
your
honor.
but
again,
we
do
not
have
all
of
mr.
generes’
tax
returns
in
the
record
of
his
salary,
his
total
income
aggregated
about
$40000
per
year.
the
man
had
formed
simple
savings
and
loan
association
in
the
1930's
and
had
always
been
the
president
and
general
manager
and
he
always
had
a
good
salary
from
that.
he
had
been
in
the
contracting
business
long
before
he
ever
set
up
kelly-generes
construction
company.
he
started
out
in
the
contracting
business,
he
had
many
years
of
experience
on
it
then
he
formed
the
partnership
with
his
son-in-law
in
the
1940's
during
world
war
ii
and
had
been
only
in
1954
that
they
actually
incorporate.
and
at
that
point
he
became
the
owner
at
44%,
at
that
stage
of
the
game,
the
investment
in
the
corporation
was
$38900
and
i
think
in
order
to
find
out
what
the
value
of
that
investment
was
and
eight
years
later,
you
would
have
to
look
at
all
of
the
corporate
returns
and
see
what
income
the
corporation
had
generated
and
so
forth.
it
could
require
a
massive
amount
of
work
which
we
have
not
gotten
into
it
at
this
point.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
in
the
sense
that
he
would
have
to
take
into
consideration
that
he
would
pay
ordinary
income
tax
on
his
salary,
i
think
that
is
correct.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
yes,
we
do
your
honor.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
but
it
is
a
very
nominal
income
tax,
i
think
it
is
2%
and
in
--
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
he
was
82
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
he
found
it
a
very
high
premium
i
had
submit
here
your
honor.
but
the
main
point
is
that
the
initial
investment
was
only
$38000—
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
that
is
correct.
there
is
actually
no
way
of
knowing
the
exact
amount
of
the
investment
as
of
1962
but
the
point
is
that
you
have
got
a
continuing
indemnity
agreement,
i
might
submit
that
would
cast
some
light
on
this
that
starting
at
the
outset
in
1954,
at
the
time
the
initial
investment
was
made,
the
bonding
companies
were
then
requiring
personal
endorsements
and
what
happened
was
that
every
time
kelly-generes
got
a
bond
or
bid
on
a
job
and
they
had
a
job
available
to,
and
they
needed
a
bond,
allen
generes
and
bill
kelly
went
to
maryland
casualty
and
got
a
bid
of
bond
and
they
personally
agreed
to
indemnify
maryland
casualty
company
and
it
was
found
that
that
was
very
inconvenient
and
as
a
result
in
1958,
a
blanket
indemnity
agreement
was
executed
so
that
you
did
not
to
keep
going
to
maryland
with
each
job
that
was
bid.
the
corporation
did
have
assets,
we
can
not
deny
it,
there
is
testimony
in
the
record
that
would
give
some
indication
there
that
there
were
some
substantial
assets
but
that
these
where
mortgaged
up
to
the
hilt.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
it
does,
there
were
no
dividends
paid.
this
corporation
never
paid
a
dividend
ever
since--
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
that
is
correct,
it
was
a
closely
held
corporation,
that
did
have
the
son-in-law,
then
they
were
other
son-on-laws
who
had
about
12%,
i
think
it
is
the
stock
of
the
corporation
but
throughout
its
history,
the
corporation
never
paid
a
dividend
but
it
did
pay
his
salary
and
it
paid
the
salary
every
year
and
there
are
some
years,
in
fact
the
record
does
show,
that
there
were
some
years
when
the
corporation
operated
at
a
deficit.
and
i
think
over
a
$40000
dollar
deficit
of
one
year
projected,
continued
to
pay
these
salaries.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
that
is
correct
but
none
of
those
tax
returns
are
in
the
record
your
honor.
and
it
was
only
incorporated
in
1954.
we
do
not
know
what
it
did
--
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
no,
but
the
main
point
is
there
was
no
return
here
to
this
man
that
is
the
kind
of
return
that
is
peculiar
to
an
investor
--
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
it
would
be,
he
was
receiving
a
salary
every
year
and
this
is
what
he
testified
--
primarily
motivated,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
testified
that
was
his
sole
motivation
when
he
did
it
and
there
was
testimony
by
other
parties
that
would
support
that
but
i
would
submit
that
in
concluding,
your
honor,
that
even
under
a
dominant
motivation
test
as
the
government
argues
that
allen
h.
generes
was
predominantly
motivated
to
protect
that
salary
the
he
was
receiving
of
$12000
a
year
and
i
think
that
the
important
question
--
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor,
but
i
would
submit
that
the
important
point
for
this
court
is
the
interpretation
of
section
166
of
the
internal
revenue
code
and
there
is
where
you
get
down
the
question
of
whether
the
significant
motivation
is
the
proper
test
or
whether
the
dominant
motivation
is
the
proper
test
and
for
the
reasons
set
forth
in
our
brief
and
primarily
because
congress
itself
did
not
save
primarily
in
connection
with
the
trade
or
business
but
simply
in
connection
with
the
trade
or
business
which
the
commissioner
says
and
as
this
court
has
inferentially
approved,
there
must
only
be
a
proximate
relationship
and
i
submit
just
as
there
maybe
more
than
one
cause,
a
man
may
have
more
than
one
motive.
you
will
not
necessarily
find
that
it
is
going
to
be
easier
for
juries
to
sit
down
and
weigh
a
man's
motivations
and
decide
which
is
the
dominant
and
which
is
the
less
dominant
anymore.
so
it
maybe
much
easier
to
look
at
one
motive
and
decide
is
it
significant
or
is
it
not
significant
and
you
are
not
going
to
be
opening
the
doors
to
baseless
deductions
by
simply
saying
the
in
connection
with
requirement
means
that
there
must
be
a
significant
relationship.
juries
do
not
have
that
much
problem
with
the
meaning
of
the
word
significant
and
i
would
submit
that
means
important
and
they
would
know
i
think
it
would
be
just
as
easy
to
determine
between
significant
and
insignificant
motivations
as
it
maybe
to
try
to
weigh
on
a
scale,
the
difference
between
a
dominant
motive
and
a
less
dominant
motive.
for
those
reasons,
i
submit
to
this
court
that
the
trial
judges
charged
to
the
jury
was
imminently
fair
and
must
imminently
appropriate
and
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
proper
and
i
urge
the
affirmance
of
the
court
of
appeal’s
decision.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
i
do
not
know.
it
is
very
interesting,
that
government
made
the
point
that
if
you
adopt
the
significant
motivation
test,
the
government
is
going
to
lose
every
one
of
its
cases
and
everybody
would
get
a
business
bad
debt
deduction
and
in
the
very
case,
they
decided
the
waddell
case,
the
taxpayer
lost
because
taxpayer
could
not
prove
a
significant
motivation
to
protect
--
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
the
seventh
circuit
--
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
that
is
correct,
the
seventh
circuit
in
subsequent
to
the--
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
there
have
been
any
number
of
other
cases,
in
fact
i
might
say
to
this
court
that
the
generes
case
which
we
are
now
arguing
to
you
has
been
noted
in
three
law
reviews
since
it
has
been
decided.
it
just
came
out,
since
our
briefs
were
written
and
we
had
to
submit
memos,
if
the
court
wants.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
i
do
not
think
so.
under
either
theory,
the
taxpayer
could
not
win
and
that
of
course
may
very
well
happen
if
this
court
approves
a
significant
motivation
test.
but
even
under
significant,
if
you
cannot
prove
the
significant
relationship
then
the
taxpayer
cannot
prevail
even
on
that
matter.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
i
did
not
argue
the
waddell
case
your
honor
and
i
was
not
privy
to
all
but
it
transpired
in
the
case
so
i
would
not
want
to
take
that
position
but
i
would
submit
that
the
reasoning
of
the
majority
opinion
in
the
waddell
case
is
very
persuasive
and
i
think
it
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
it
is
right
here
with
me,
your
honor.
you
want
the
one
that's
in
texas
tech
university
law
reviews
at
volume
two,
number
two,
beginning
at
page
318.
the
other
is
in
the
university
of
florida
law
review
and
i
am
sorry,
this
does
not
have
the
law
review
--
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
i
might
say
that
they
can
split
the
same
way
the
circuits
have
but
as
again,
they
have
gone
2:1
saying
that
the
generes
case
was
properly
decided
by
the
courts
below.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
i
see
no,
it
is
a
page
document—
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
yes,
i
think.
i
do
not
say
that
there
would
be
a
significant
difference
between
the
two.
“in
the
course
of”
i
think
it
shows
a
directness
that
“in
connection
with”
does
not
have,
just
as
here
in
section
166;
you
have
an
a
and
the
b.
the
b
says,
a
debt
which
is
“incurred
in.”
when
you
have
an
“incurred
in,”
there
is
a
directness
that
i
think
is
not
the
same
as
when
you
say
a
debt
created
or
acquired
“in
connection
with”
a
trade
or
business.
i
would
submit
that
by
doing
that
congress
is
saying,
it
does
not
have
to
be
directly
incurred
in
the
business.
the
relationship,
as
the
commissioner
interpreted
that
must
be
proximate
and
then
the
question
is
commissioner
did
not
define
proximate
and
we
have
to
come
along
and
define
it.
that
is
basically
what
the
trial
judge
charged
the
jury
on
that
there
must
be
a
proximate
relationship
and
i
would
submit
just
as
in
tort
law
whether
there
maybe
more
than
one
proximate
cause,
here
there
maybe
more
than
one
motivation
and
what
you
are
looking
at
is
the
significant
motivation.
i
think
and
if
the
business
relationship
between
the
taxpayer’s
act,
the
debt
and
the
loss,
if
there
is
a
significant
relationship
between
that
debt
and
the
trade
or
business
of
the
taxpayer
then
i
submit
that
under
166
as
written,
the
taxpayer
is
entitled
to
a
business
bad
debt
deduction
and
if
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
disapproves
of
that,
he
wants
them
to
have
the
predominant
test
or
the
dominant
motivation
then
they
should
go
to
congress
and
get
congress
to
amend
section
166
and
say
a
debt
created
or
acquired
as
the
case
maybe
primarily
in
connection
with
the
trade
or
business.
that
would
have
resolved
the
point
and
i
would
not
have
the
nerve
to
argue
a
significant
motivation
test
to
the
court
if
congress
had
put
in
the
word
'primarily'
as
they
have
in
many
other
sections
of
the
code.
but
they
did
not
put
it
in
and
the
solicitor
general
wants
you
to
put
it
in
for
them.
mr.
max
nathan,
jr.
thank
you
very
much
your
honor,
it
is
been
a
pleasure
and
a
privilege
for
me
to
appear
before
the
court.
