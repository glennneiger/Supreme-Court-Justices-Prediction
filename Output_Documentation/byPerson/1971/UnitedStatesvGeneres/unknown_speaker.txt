unknown
speaker
mr.
zinn,
incidentally
are
his
returns
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
do
they
show
roughly
what
his
gross
income
was
for
the
year
in
question?
unknown
speaker
it
must
include
the
two
salary
items.
unknown
speaker
anything
more
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
which
would
take
him
close
to
42-50%?
unknown
speaker
just
because
he
was
in
fact
a
stockholder?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
about
the
value
of
these
stocks?
unknown
speaker
and
what
was
the
loan
of
this
guarantee?
unknown
speaker
and
what
was
his
salary?
unknown
speaker
do
you
make
an
argument
that
he
really
would
not
guarantee
loan
of
$160,000
just
to
protect
his
$12000
salary
income?
unknown
speaker
they
are
not
an
issue
here.
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
add
the
stocks--
unknown
speaker
but
would
you
--
do
you
make
the
argument
that
no
one
would
guarantee
a
loan
of
this
amount
just
to
protect
his
$12000
salary?
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
why
that
i
want
to
know.
unknown
speaker
on
that
basis
why
would
he
do
it
to
protect
the
$150,000?
unknown
speaker
mr.
zinn,
this
is
of
no
relevance
but
this
case
of
course
came
up
to
the
district
court.
unknown
speaker
why
is
it
that
your
appendix
make
reference
to
the
united
states
tax
court
on
page
one.
i
assume
this
is
an
error.
unknown
speaker
page
one
at
very
top,
the
united
state
tax
court,
is
this
an
error?
unknown
speaker
again
the
question
mr.
justice
white
asked,
is
there
anything
on
the
record
showing
the
actual
value
of
that
investment?
unknown
speaker
just
the
book--
unknown
speaker
and
this
was
the
opportunity
to
show
that
it
was
not
a
lesser
value
than
that.
unknown
speaker
if
he
wanted
to.
unknown
speaker
i
guess
you
are
contending
that
if
the
treasury
regulations
instead
of
saying
proximate,
and
said
primary,
it
must
be
the
primary
motivation
as
the
regulation
had
been
invalid
under
this
act?
unknown
speaker
you
are
relying
on
the
statute
rather
than
the
regulation?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
treasury
interprets
its
his
own
regulation
that
it
says
that
proximate
means
primary.
unknown
speaker
but
we
certainly
have
to
settle
this
case.
unknown
speaker
in
prior,
in
prior—
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
it
is
a
matter
of
law
in
connection
with
the
trade
or
business
means
that
it
must
be
a
business
bad
debt,
if
it
is
incurred
for
two
reasons,
one
is
business
reason
and
one
is
non-business
reason?
unknown
speaker
let
us
say
it
be
50-50.
then
50-50
is
take
in
connection
with
the
necessarily
means
that
it
is
a
business
bad
debt,
even
though
50%
of
the
reason
is
that
it
is
not
in
connection
with
the
business.
unknown
speaker
what
if
they
ruled
--
assume
that
is
business
which
has
got
a
partnership,
there
wouldn't
have
been
any
question?
unknown
speaker
but
let
us
say
he
had
to
guarantee
the
bank
loan.
would
there
have
been
any
question
about
it?
unknown
speaker
its
a
partnership?
unknown
speaker
mr.
nathan,
i
am
a
little
intrigued
by
comparative
values
here
as
i
read
these
briefs,
there
is
a
good
bit
of
talk
about
the
value
of
the
investment
on
the
one
hand
in
the
salary
on
the
other.
and
all
was
the
latter
as
referred
to
as
$12000.
the
difficulty
i
have
is
that
the
investment
consists
of
tax
paid
dollars.
the
salary
consists
of
pretax
dollars
and
hence
my
inquiry
of
mr.
zinn
as
to
find
to
get
some
feel
for
the
tax
bracket
in
which
this
man
was,
actually
he
is
not
protecting
the
$12000
net
salaries,
protecting
the
$12000
gross
salary
on
your
approach
which
i
assume
in
actual
dollars
mean
something
far
less
than
that
doing.
maybe
$7000
or
so,
would
you
agree?
unknown
speaker
but
my
inquiry
is
directed
to
the
other
side
of
the
scale
and
i
think
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
$12000
salary,
if
one
argues
that
this
is
what
he
was
trying
to
protect
in
the
way
of
cold
dollars
in
his
pocket,
is
a
little
misleading
that
something
far
less
than
that.
unknown
speaker
but
i
think
the
balance,
if
there
is
one
is
the
investment
on
one
hand
against
maybe
$7000
pre-state
income
tax
on
the
other.
do
you
have
an
income
tax?
unknown
speaker
so
it
is
even
less
than—
unknown
speaker
we
would
decide
that
question
--
unknown
speaker
until
this
case,
the
leading
case
in
this
field
has
been
waddell,
the
waddell
case,
the
opinion
written
by
judge
finley?
unknown
speaker
it
appeals
to
the
second
circuit.
unknown
speaker
didn't
the
seventh
circuit
decide
the
contrary?
unknown
speaker
and
they
blocked
two
years
after
waddell
--
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
besides
it
really
was
not
really
critical
in
waddell
to
decide
the
standard,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
even
reach
the
standard
question
in
waddell
right?
unknown
speaker
i
would
be
interested
in
those
law
reviews
citations,
and
otherwise
you
have
--
unknown
speaker
well
perhaps,
you
can
just
submit
it
to
the
court.
unknown
speaker
mr.
