mr.
j.
michael
shea
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
arrested
in
january
of
1970,
in
leon
county,
florida
for
the
crime
of
carrying
a
concealed
weapon,
punishable
in
florida
by
imprisonment
for
six
months
or
fine
of
a
thousand
dollars.
he
was
arraigned
and
pled
guilty
the
next
day
and
was
sentenced
to
90
days
or
$500
fine.
the
original
petition
was
filled
in
the
supreme
court
of
florida
the
same
month
and
that
court
rendered
its
decision
in
june
of
the
same
year.
the
court
although,
establishing
a
new
rule
for
florida,
denied
the
petitioners
right
to
the
counsel.
a
cert
has
been
granted
by
this
court
and
it
is
our
contention
that
a
person
charged
with
any
crime,
should
be
given
the
right
to
counsel,
even
in
the
situation
where
he
is
indigent.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
originally,
before
the
argersinger
case,
the
rule
was
fisher
versus
state,
which
was
decided
in
florida
in
1964,
and
in
that
case
the
florida
supreme
court
ruled
that
the
right
to
counsel
as
decided
in
this
case,
only
applied
to
felonies.
now,
since
then,
they
have
upheld
that
several
times,
but
then
changed
their
mind
in
a
four-to-three
decision
of
this
case,
in
the
lower
--
in
the
june
decision
and
now
we
have
a
more
than
six-month
rule
in
florida,
and
this
defendant
then
lost
by
one
day.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
no,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
if
it
carries
more
than
six
months,
no
matter
what
the
label
–
(voice
overlap)
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
incarceration
for
more
than
one
year.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
incarceration
in
the
state.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes,
your
honor.
we
have
some
misdemeanors
in
florida
where
a
person
can
be
incarcerated
for
more
than
a
year,
but
that
would
be
in
a
situation
where
they
would
be
kept
in
a
county
facility,
so
it
is
possible
in
florida
to
be
incarcerated
for
a
misdemeanor
for
more
than
a
year.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
no
sir,
it
is
labeled
a
misdemeanor,
although,
if
it
is
municipal
violation,
then
it
would
be
a
municipal
violation.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
i
assume
from
reading
the
argersinger
decision
from
florida
that
the
rule
would
apply.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
they
are
called
city
ordinances
or
ordinances
of
the
city
violation
and
the
same
ordinance
would
be
a
traffic
violation
in
state
court.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir.
i
think
that
the
question
of
the
difference
between
the
terminologies
probably
been
laid
to
rest
with
this
court’s
decision
of
waller.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
no,
of
course
this
is
only
a
speculation
on
our
part,
however,
i
would
refer
the
court
to
our
footnote
2,
18
or
19,
which
we
state
that
in
the
city
of
new
york,
there
was
1,800,000
misdemeanors
depicted
in
1969,
and
of
those
only
40
were
actually
incarcerated.
so
although
--
mr.
j.
michael
shea
the
test
is
made.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
no
sir.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
no
sir,
but
i
think
in
this,
we
have
to
look
to
the
practicality
of
it.
actually,
we
are
only
talking
about
40
people,
40
people
out
of
1,800,000.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
well,
that
is
what
the
actual
figure
show.
if
i
may
continue,
the
--
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir,
there
are
and
this
has
lead
to
a
great
deal
of
confusion
in
our
state
and
some
of
the
other
states
in
our
circuit.
presently,
there
are
quite
a
number
of
habeas
corpuses
in
federal
courts,
which
are
pending
the
decision
of
this
court
and
this
case.
there
has
been
a
federal
judge
in
jacksonville,
which
has
ordered
one
of
our
counties
in
that
area
to
have
their
jps
inform
all
defendants
that
they
have
right
to
counsel.
this
was
in
a
form
of
an
injunction.
in
my
hometown,
the
city
of
tampa,
our
federal
judge
has
a
reserved
ruling
on
a
case
before
him
requiring
the
municipal
court
judges
inform
defendants
of
their
right
to
counsel.
we
have
a
situation
where
they
–
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
well,
their
right
to
counsel
in
a
situation
where
the
person
has
ended.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
i
suggest,
your
honor
that
there
has
been
a
long
time
--
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
no,
that
is
what
it
is
all
about.
the
judge
has
respectively
reserved
ruling
on
it,
until
such
time.
we
do
have
three
judges,
i
also
about
to
say
and
one
of
them
informs
of
the
right
and
the
other
two
do
not.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
in
all
cases.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir.
if
a
parking
ticket
case
would
come
before
the
court.
however,
they
do
not
come
before
our
courts,
so
i
suggest
that
it
is
impossible
for
a
person
to
go
to
prison
in
florida
for
a
parking
ticket,
now
he
made
--
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir.
the
parking
ticket
situation,
i
am
not
saying
that
a
person
could
go
to
prison
for
a
parking
ticket
violation,
but
not
the
violation
itself.
if
he
is
a
(voice
overlap)
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes,
alright.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir!
that
is
our
position.
i
have
closing
statement
that
will
make
specifically
to
that
point.
i
think
that
the
constitution
is
clear
on
that,
it
says
in
article
vi
that
all
criminal
prosecutions,
where
a
person
may
have
the
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel
for
the
defense.
i
think
that
is
absolutely
clear
and
it
makes
no
limitation
on
the
person’s
income.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir
and
i
think
we
have
to
assume
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
applies
to
the
state
of
florida
and
the
--
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
i
am
glad
that
sometimes
i
wondered
if
some
justices
realize
that.
if
i
may
continue
on
--
mr.
j.
michael
shea
no
sir,
i
think
the
distinction
between
the
sixth
amendment,
rights
are
quite
different
though
and
the
mere
fact
that
this
court
has
chosen
to
treat
jury
trials
differently
is
of
no
bearing
on
the
right
to
counsel.
i
think
that
we
can
say
that
a
fair
trial
can
be
had
in
this
country
without
a
jury.
we
had
been
doing
it
for
a
quite
sometime
and
i
do
not
feel
that
it
is
an
essential
element
to
a
trial.
but
in
an
adversary
system,
where
the
state
is
providing
a
prosecutor,
it
is
completely
unthinkable
to
expect
the
defendant
to
get
up
and
defend
himself
and
then,
say
that
the
trial
is
fair.
and,
i
would
also
add
that
the
other
vices
as
outlined
in
the
sixth
amendment
are
not
restricted
as
is
the
jury
trial.
i
think
this
was
adequately
even
pointed
out
in
the
decision
that
your
honor
is
speaking
of,
like
justice
white
when
he
wrote
(inaudible)
when
he
said
that
indeed
the
prospect
of
imprisonment
for
however
short
of
time
will
seldom
be
viewed
by
the
accused
as
a
trivial
or
petty
matter
and
may
well
result
in
quite
serious
effects
to
the
defendant.
if
we
look
to
the
various
states,
we
find
that
the
question
is,
as
was
in
gideon
quite
unclear.
we
would
offer
though
that
our
position
is
not
one
that
is
impossible.
there
are
two
states
at
present
that
are
currently
holding
our
suggested
point
of
view,
the
state
of
minnesota
and
the
state
of
new
jersey.
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
the
lower
court
decision
of
our
case,
we
had
a
four-to-three
decision
and
in
the
descending
opinion
was
to
chief
justice
then,
of
the
state
of
florida,
richard
ervin,
who
maybe
familiar
to
the
court,
he
was
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
florida
in
the
gideon
case
and
presented
that
brief.
so,
i
think
it
is
safe
to
assume
that
our
chief
justice
has
now
taken
a
180
degree
turn
of
the
then,
chief
justice.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir.
there
have
been
several
arguments
raised
against
our
opposition.
the
jury
trial
was
uncommon
at
all
is
just
one
such.
the
state
has
also
point
it
out
in
their
brief
that
there
is
a
possibility
of
a
boykin
error.
we
do
not
feel
that
there
is
a
boykin
error.
there
cannot
be
a
boykin
error
unless
there
is
an
intelligent
waiver.
there
cannot
be
an
intelligent
waiver
unless
a
person
is
afforded
the
right
to
counsel.
this
is
an
elementary
thing
and
must
come
before
we
can
even
consider
those.
there
has
been
a
suggestion
that
the
criminal
justice
act
has
limited
the
right
to
counsel.
it
is
our
position
that
that
act
does
not
limit
the
right
to
counsel.
it
speaks
more
specifically,
if
one
takes
a
closer
reading
to
compensation
for
counsel.
and,
the
fact
that
congress
has
chosen
to
compensate
attorneys
who
handle
more
lengthy
cases
and
involved
cases
and
not
those
of
some
of
the
lesser
offenses,
i
think
should
have
no
bearing
on
a
constitutional
right.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
no
sir,
i
do
not
think
he
can.
i
think
he
has
to
be
informed
of
all
the
problems,
the
ramifications
of
what
he
is
charged
with.
his
possible
defenses
and
what
the
possible
sentence
is
and
everything
else,
and
only
after
he
has
been
completely
advised
of
his
present
situation
and
the
possibilities
that
he
has,
can
he
then
make
a
decision.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir.
i
have
a
few
of
those.[laughter]i
still
advise
them.
the
only
problem
that
i
really
see
is
the
rules
of
procedures
for
the
trial
of
minor
offenses
before
magistrates.
if
we
assume
that
those
rules,
whereas
the
negative
predicate
suggest
that
our
petitioner
here
today
is
lost
and
we
can
at
least
suggest
that.
however,
it
is
our
position
that
if
we
are
to
interpret
that
rule,
that
way
that
it
is
unconstitutional
rule
and
violation
of
the
sixth
and
fourteenth,
i
would
hope
that
this
court
would
not
put
this
question
to
rest
with
a
negative
predicate.
we
would
like
to
offer,
what
we
feel
is
a
completely
workable
rule,
as
a
test
for
the
right
to
counsel.
in
the
case
of
james
v.
headley,
judge
wisdom
handed
down
a
rule,
which
has
been
most
successfully
used.
a
defendant
must
be
given
a
counsel
whether
there
is
a
practical
possibility
that
he
might
be
sent
to
jail.
and,
in
that
we
mean
that
in
those
situations,
such
as
have
been
raised
by
the
state
of
a
person
spitting
on
a
sidewalk,
of
parking
tickets,
of
jaywalking,
and
all
the
other
minor
offenses,
we
suggest
that
these
are
not
practical
possibility
of
a
person
going
to
prison.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir,
and
i
would
ask
them,
to
offer
to
us
some
statistics
where
someone
did
go
to
prison
for
that.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
if
you
are
speaking
in
aba
minimum,
that
is
one
standard.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir.
i
think
that
we
would
go
along
with
that
and
say
that
our
position
is
in
line
with
that
suggested
minimum
standard.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes,
your
honor
i
have
and
suggest
that
it
is
impossible
for
a
person
to
go,
practically
impossible
for
a
person
to
go
to
prison
for
spitting
on
a
sidewalk.
the
statistics
just
do
not
bear
out.
as
a
second
part
of
our
suggested
test,
we
would
like
to
say
that
it
should
be
added
then
--
mr.
j.
michael
shea
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
j.
michael
shea
no
sir,
because
the
second
part
--(voice
overlap)
mr.
j.
michael
shea
the
second
part
of
our
suggestion
would
cover
that.(voice
overlap)
mr.
j.
michael
shea
well,
if
i
may
continue
addressing
myself
to
that
--
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir.
the
second
phase
of
this
would
be
that,
no
person
could
then
in
fact
be
sent
to
a
jail,
unless
he
had
been
given
right
to
counsel.
and,
i
think
this
would
take
care
of
that.
for
many,
many
years
we
have
had
justices
and
judges
in
our
court
system
that
have
taken
it
upon
themselves
to
appoint
counsel
in
situations
where
they
felt
is
the
magnitude
of
the
charge
or
case
itself
warranted
such
a
thing.
and,
we
are
suggesting
that
this
can
be
done
and
in
those
situations
where
it
appears
that
there
is
a
possibility
of
sentence,
the
right
of
counsel
be
afforded.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir.
we
would
suggest
that
it
would
be
better
to
set
a
rule
of
this
nature,
saying
that
if
there
is
a
possibility
of
a
sentence,
then
he
must
be
given
the
right
to
counsel
from
the
outset.
if
that
decision
is
made,
one
way
the
other
and
he
is
not
given
that
attorney,
then
he
may
not
be
sent
to
prison
even
though
the
facts
may
develop
as
you
have
suggested.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
i
would
have
to
admit,
it
is
possible
--
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir.
and,
i
think
that
in
the
actual
practice
of
it,
in
speaking
of
that
particular
circumstance
that
it
is
better
to
let
a
few
of
these
people,
maybe
not
go
to
prison
and
have
a
stiffer
fine
or
some
other
type
of
–-(voice
overlap)
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes,
your
honor.
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
we
are
offering
this
test,
i
also
point
out
as
chief
justice
has
said
that
the
test
is
also
one
recommended
by
the
aba
minimum
standards.
we
suggest
that
there
is
another
possibility
for
a
test
and
that
would
be
in
a
stricter
application,
looking
directly
at
the
statute
and
if
the
statute
has
a
possibility
at
all
of
imprisonment,
that
then
counsel
must
be
provided
if
the
person
is
indigent.
if
that
were
the
rule
to
be
handed
down
by
this
case
--
this
court,
i
would
hope
that
the
american
juris
prudence
system
would
take
he,
the
president
nixon’s
latest
comments
on
this,
on
legal
reform
and
that
we
proceed
to
eliminate
from
the
possibility
of
incarceration,
many
of
these
minor
crimes,
where
there
is
no
victim.
i
think
that
i
will
save
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
for
the
state.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
understand
how
we
convict
anything
less
than
one
day.
how
can
we
arbitrarily
say
that
1
day,
30
days
or
60
days.
to
the
man
that
sitting
in
jail,
that
decision
is
completely
arbitrary.
i
also
would
offer
that
there
is
no
logical
reason
for
picking
60
days
or
90
days
or
six
months.
as
to
some
of
the
points
that
mr.
georgieff
raised,
i
believe
there
is
now
a
florida
statute
that
was
recently
passed
in
our
last
session
that
makes
county
ordinances
is
the
same
as
misdemeanors
and
that
is
a
session
law
of
70-453,
sub-section
something
or
other.
i
also
want
to
try
to
make
it
clear
that
our
position
is
that,
we
do
not
feel
that
it
is
necessary
to
make
the
counsel
appointment
that
will
not
result
to
the
counsel
appointed
in
all
of
misdemeanor
cases,
only
those
where
each
practical
possibilities
that
the
person
may
receive
some
incarceration.
i
think
that
the
position
of
the
fifth
circuit
was
a
bit
misleading,
as
far
as
the
state
was
presented.
they
said
that
the
fifth
circuit
has
a
90
days
rule.
i
do
not
think
that
is
quite
the
case.
the
fifth
circuit
has
ruled
on
a
case
in
which
they
said
a
person
charged
with
an
offense
that
received
90
days
should
be
given
a
right
to
counsel,
but
i
think
they
left
the
bottom
into
that
open
and
they
have
only
ruled
in
the
other
cases
on
similar
special
circumstances.
in
conclusion,
i
think
that
it
is
evident
that
our
position
and
that
of
the
states
is
not
that
far
apart.
they
have
not
come
before
you
this
morning
and
suggested
that
a
man
not
be
given
the
right
to
counsel
in
misdemeanors.
they
have
only
suggested
that
it
should
be
either
six
months
and
now
they
have
come
with
another
possibility
of
60
days.
we
feel
that
the
only
real
test
is
to
go
completely
as
the
constitution
says.
a
person
who
is
in
the
position
of
a
possible
incarceration
must
be
given
the
right
to
counsel.
and
if
he
is
not
given
that
right,
he
cannot
be
sent
to
prison.
it
is
that
simple,
that
is
our
test.
no,
attorney
--
mr.
j.
michael
shea
correct
sir.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
no
sir,
i
think
that,
that
is
another
situation
that
we
get
into;
contempts
and
things
of
that
nature
and
if
a
person
did
not
pay
the
fine
then
he
would,
i
assume
be
charged
with
a
contempt
violation
and
in
fact,
would
be
afforded
an
attorney.
so,
i
think
that
the
possibility
of
a
person
getting
up
here
with
that
argument
is
a
much
more
remote.
our
suggestion,
to
boil
it
down
in
its
simplest
form,
is
no
attorney,
no
jail.
i
think
the
greatest
freedom
that
we
have
in
this
country
is
our
liberty
and
when
a
man
is
afforded
counsel,
it
is
the
only
method
he
has
of
protecting
that
liberty
when
he
stands
on
our
courts.
if
we
take
that
right
away,
we
also
take
his
liberty
away.
to
say
less
is
to
compromise
the
freedoms
of
our
constitution.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir,
i
am.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
i
think
they
are
unconstitutional,
as
they
apply
to
the
right
to
counsel.
they
are
strict
violation
of
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
and
i
do
not
feel
that
they
specifically
go
to
the
question
and
i
think
it
is
only
a
reference
in
a
form
of
a
negative
pregnant
and
i
hope
--
mr.
j.
michael
shea
no
sir,
i
think
that
was
my
original
answer
when
i
was
asked
that
question
before.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
i
think
they
are
unconstitutional.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
because
they
are
in
violation
of
the
constitution.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
because,
the
constitution
says
that
a
person
shall
have
the
right
to
counsel.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
in
all
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
well,
i
think
that
the
only
way
that
it
can
construed
that
they
do
say
that
is
through
that
negative
pregnant
and
i
would
suggest
that
is
a
cool
way
of
putting
this
question
to
bid.
i
do
not
read
it
that
way
myself.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
as
affecting
the
right
to
counsel,
but
if
it
does
--
mr.
j.
michael
shea
that
is
right
sir.
if
it
is
read
that
way
and
on
the
alternative
if
it
is
--
i
would
suggest
that
if
it
possible
that
the
other
construction
could
be
read
and
if
that
be
the
case,
then
it
is
our
position
that
they
are
unconstitutional.
any
further
questions
sir?
mr.
j.
michael
shea
thank
you
sir.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
arrested
in
january
of
1970,
in
leon
county,
florida
for
the
crime
of
carrying
a
concealed
weapon,
punishable
in
florida
by
imprisonment
for
six
months
or
fine
of
a
thousand
dollars.
he
was
arraigned
and
pled
guilty
the
next
day
and
was
sentenced
to
90
days
or
$500
fine.
the
original
petition
was
filled
in
the
supreme
court
of
florida
the
same
month
and
that
court
rendered
its
decision
in
june
of
the
same
year.
the
court
although,
establishing
a
new
rule
for
florida,
denied
the
petitioners
right
to
the
counsel.
a
cert
has
been
granted
by
this
court
and
it
is
our
contention
that
a
person
charged
with
any
crime,
should
be
given
the
right
to
counsel,
even
in
the
situation
where
he
is
indigent.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
originally,
before
the
argersinger
case,
the
rule
was
fisher
versus
state,
which
was
decided
in
florida
in
1964,
and
in
that
case
the
florida
supreme
court
ruled
that
the
right
to
counsel
as
decided
in
this
case,
only
applied
to
felonies.
now,
since
then,
they
have
upheld
that
several
times,
but
then
changed
their
mind
in
a
four-to-three
decision
of
this
case,
in
the
lower
--
in
the
june
decision
and
now
we
have
a
more
than
six-month
rule
in
florida,
and
this
defendant
then
lost
by
one
day.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
no,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
if
it
carries
more
than
six
months,
no
matter
what
the
label
–
(voice
overlap)
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
incarceration
for
more
than
one
year.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
incarceration
in
the
state.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes,
your
honor.
we
have
some
misdemeanors
in
florida
where
a
person
can
be
incarcerated
for
more
than
a
year,
but
that
would
be
in
a
situation
where
they
would
be
kept
in
a
county
facility,
so
it
is
possible
in
florida
to
be
incarcerated
for
a
misdemeanor
for
more
than
a
year.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
no
sir,
it
is
labeled
a
misdemeanor,
although,
if
it
is
municipal
violation,
then
it
would
be
a
municipal
violation.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
i
assume
from
reading
the
argersinger
decision
from
florida
that
the
rule
would
apply.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
they
are
called
city
ordinances
or
ordinances
of
the
city
violation
and
the
same
ordinance
would
be
a
traffic
violation
in
state
court.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir.
i
think
that
the
question
of
the
difference
between
the
terminologies
probably
been
laid
to
rest
with
this
court’s
decision
of
waller.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
no,
of
course
this
is
only
a
speculation
on
our
part,
however,
i
would
refer
the
court
to
our
footnote
2,
18
or
19,
which
we
state
that
in
the
city
of
new
york,
there
was
1,800,000
misdemeanors
depicted
in
1969,
and
of
those
only
40
were
actually
incarcerated.
so
although
--
mr.
j.
michael
shea
the
test
is
made.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
no
sir.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
no
sir,
but
i
think
in
this,
we
have
to
look
to
the
practicality
of
it.
actually,
we
are
only
talking
about
40
people,
40
people
out
of
1,800,000.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
well,
that
is
what
the
actual
figure
show.
if
i
may
continue,
the
--
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir,
there
are
and
this
has
lead
to
a
great
deal
of
confusion
in
our
state
and
some
of
the
other
states
in
our
circuit.
presently,
there
are
quite
a
number
of
habeas
corpuses
in
federal
courts,
which
are
pending
the
decision
of
this
court
and
this
case.
there
has
been
a
federal
judge
in
jacksonville,
which
has
ordered
one
of
our
counties
in
that
area
to
have
their
jps
inform
all
defendants
that
they
have
right
to
counsel.
this
was
in
a
form
of
an
injunction.
in
my
hometown,
the
city
of
tampa,
our
federal
judge
has
a
reserved
ruling
on
a
case
before
him
requiring
the
municipal
court
judges
inform
defendants
of
their
right
to
counsel.
we
have
a
situation
where
they
–
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
well,
their
right
to
counsel
in
a
situation
where
the
person
has
ended.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
i
suggest,
your
honor
that
there
has
been
a
long
time
--
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
no,
that
is
what
it
is
all
about.
the
judge
has
respectively
reserved
ruling
on
it,
until
such
time.
we
do
have
three
judges,
i
also
about
to
say
and
one
of
them
informs
of
the
right
and
the
other
two
do
not.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
in
all
cases.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir.
if
a
parking
ticket
case
would
come
before
the
court.
however,
they
do
not
come
before
our
courts,
so
i
suggest
that
it
is
impossible
for
a
person
to
go
to
prison
in
florida
for
a
parking
ticket,
now
he
made
--
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir.
the
parking
ticket
situation,
i
am
not
saying
that
a
person
could
go
to
prison
for
a
parking
ticket
violation,
but
not
the
violation
itself.
if
he
is
a
(voice
overlap)
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes,
alright.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir!
that
is
our
position.
i
have
closing
statement
that
will
make
specifically
to
that
point.
i
think
that
the
constitution
is
clear
on
that,
it
says
in
article
vi
that
all
criminal
prosecutions,
where
a
person
may
have
the
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel
for
the
defense.
i
think
that
is
absolutely
clear
and
it
makes
no
limitation
on
the
person’s
income.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir
and
i
think
we
have
to
assume
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
applies
to
the
state
of
florida
and
the
--
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
i
am
glad
that
sometimes
i
wondered
if
some
justices
realize
that.
if
i
may
continue
on
--
mr.
j.
michael
shea
no
sir,
i
think
the
distinction
between
the
sixth
amendment,
rights
are
quite
different
though
and
the
mere
fact
that
this
court
has
chosen
to
treat
jury
trials
differently
is
of
no
bearing
on
the
right
to
counsel.
i
think
that
we
can
say
that
a
fair
trial
can
be
had
in
this
country
without
a
jury.
we
had
been
doing
it
for
a
quite
sometime
and
i
do
not
feel
that
it
is
an
essential
element
to
a
trial.
but
in
an
adversary
system,
where
the
state
is
providing
a
prosecutor,
it
is
completely
unthinkable
to
expect
the
defendant
to
get
up
and
defend
himself
and
then,
say
that
the
trial
is
fair.
and,
i
would
also
add
that
the
other
vices
as
outlined
in
the
sixth
amendment
are
not
restricted
as
is
the
jury
trial.
i
think
this
was
adequately
even
pointed
out
in
the
decision
that
your
honor
is
speaking
of,
like
justice
white
when
he
wrote
(inaudible)
when
he
said
that
indeed
the
prospect
of
imprisonment
for
however
short
of
time
will
seldom
be
viewed
by
the
accused
as
a
trivial
or
petty
matter
and
may
well
result
in
quite
serious
effects
to
the
defendant.
if
we
look
to
the
various
states,
we
find
that
the
question
is,
as
was
in
gideon
quite
unclear.
we
would
offer
though
that
our
position
is
not
one
that
is
impossible.
there
are
two
states
at
present
that
are
currently
holding
our
suggested
point
of
view,
the
state
of
minnesota
and
the
state
of
new
jersey.
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
the
lower
court
decision
of
our
case,
we
had
a
four-to-three
decision
and
in
the
descending
opinion
was
to
chief
justice
then,
of
the
state
of
florida,
richard
ervin,
who
maybe
familiar
to
the
court,
he
was
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
florida
in
the
gideon
case
and
presented
that
brief.
so,
i
think
it
is
safe
to
assume
that
our
chief
justice
has
now
taken
a
180
degree
turn
of
the
then,
chief
justice.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir.
there
have
been
several
arguments
raised
against
our
opposition.
the
jury
trial
was
uncommon
at
all
is
just
one
such.
the
state
has
also
point
it
out
in
their
brief
that
there
is
a
possibility
of
a
boykin
error.
we
do
not
feel
that
there
is
a
boykin
error.
there
cannot
be
a
boykin
error
unless
there
is
an
intelligent
waiver.
there
cannot
be
an
intelligent
waiver
unless
a
person
is
afforded
the
right
to
counsel.
this
is
an
elementary
thing
and
must
come
before
we
can
even
consider
those.
there
has
been
a
suggestion
that
the
criminal
justice
act
has
limited
the
right
to
counsel.
it
is
our
position
that
that
act
does
not
limit
the
right
to
counsel.
it
speaks
more
specifically,
if
one
takes
a
closer
reading
to
compensation
for
counsel.
and,
the
fact
that
congress
has
chosen
to
compensate
attorneys
who
handle
more
lengthy
cases
and
involved
cases
and
not
those
of
some
of
the
lesser
offenses,
i
think
should
have
no
bearing
on
a
constitutional
right.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
no
sir,
i
do
not
think
he
can.
i
think
he
has
to
be
informed
of
all
the
problems,
the
ramifications
of
what
he
is
charged
with.
his
possible
defenses
and
what
the
possible
sentence
is
and
everything
else,
and
only
after
he
has
been
completely
advised
of
his
present
situation
and
the
possibilities
that
he
has,
can
he
then
make
a
decision.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir.
i
have
a
few
of
those.[laughter]i
still
advise
them.
the
only
problem
that
i
really
see
is
the
rules
of
procedures
for
the
trial
of
minor
offenses
before
magistrates.
if
we
assume
that
those
rules,
whereas
the
negative
predicate
suggest
that
our
petitioner
here
today
is
lost
and
we
can
at
least
suggest
that.
however,
it
is
our
position
that
if
we
are
to
interpret
that
rule,
that
way
that
it
is
unconstitutional
rule
and
violation
of
the
sixth
and
fourteenth,
i
would
hope
that
this
court
would
not
put
this
question
to
rest
with
a
negative
predicate.
we
would
like
to
offer,
what
we
feel
is
a
completely
workable
rule,
as
a
test
for
the
right
to
counsel.
in
the
case
of
james
v.
headley,
judge
wisdom
handed
down
a
rule,
which
has
been
most
successfully
used.
a
defendant
must
be
given
a
counsel
whether
there
is
a
practical
possibility
that
he
might
be
sent
to
jail.
and,
in
that
we
mean
that
in
those
situations,
such
as
have
been
raised
by
the
state
of
a
person
spitting
on
a
sidewalk,
of
parking
tickets,
of
jaywalking,
and
all
the
other
minor
offenses,
we
suggest
that
these
are
not
practical
possibility
of
a
person
going
to
prison.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir,
and
i
would
ask
them,
to
offer
to
us
some
statistics
where
someone
did
go
to
prison
for
that.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
if
you
are
speaking
in
aba
minimum,
that
is
one
standard.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir.
i
think
that
we
would
go
along
with
that
and
say
that
our
position
is
in
line
with
that
suggested
minimum
standard.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes,
your
honor
i
have
and
suggest
that
it
is
impossible
for
a
person
to
go,
practically
impossible
for
a
person
to
go
to
prison
for
spitting
on
a
sidewalk.
the
statistics
just
do
not
bear
out.
as
a
second
part
of
our
suggested
test,
we
would
like
to
say
that
it
should
be
added
then
--
mr.
j.
michael
shea
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
j.
michael
shea
no
sir,
because
the
second
part
--(voice
overlap)
mr.
j.
michael
shea
the
second
part
of
our
suggestion
would
cover
that.(voice
overlap)
mr.
j.
michael
shea
well,
if
i
may
continue
addressing
myself
to
that
--
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir.
the
second
phase
of
this
would
be
that,
no
person
could
then
in
fact
be
sent
to
a
jail,
unless
he
had
been
given
right
to
counsel.
and,
i
think
this
would
take
care
of
that.
for
many,
many
years
we
have
had
justices
and
judges
in
our
court
system
that
have
taken
it
upon
themselves
to
appoint
counsel
in
situations
where
they
felt
is
the
magnitude
of
the
charge
or
case
itself
warranted
such
a
thing.
and,
we
are
suggesting
that
this
can
be
done
and
in
those
situations
where
it
appears
that
there
is
a
possibility
of
sentence,
the
right
of
counsel
be
afforded.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir.
we
would
suggest
that
it
would
be
better
to
set
a
rule
of
this
nature,
saying
that
if
there
is
a
possibility
of
a
sentence,
then
he
must
be
given
the
right
to
counsel
from
the
outset.
if
that
decision
is
made,
one
way
the
other
and
he
is
not
given
that
attorney,
then
he
may
not
be
sent
to
prison
even
though
the
facts
may
develop
as
you
have
suggested.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
i
would
have
to
admit,
it
is
possible
--
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir.
and,
i
think
that
in
the
actual
practice
of
it,
in
speaking
of
that
particular
circumstance
that
it
is
better
to
let
a
few
of
these
people,
maybe
not
go
to
prison
and
have
a
stiffer
fine
or
some
other
type
of
–-(voice
overlap)
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes,
your
honor.
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
we
are
offering
this
test,
i
also
point
out
as
chief
justice
has
said
that
the
test
is
also
one
recommended
by
the
aba
minimum
standards.
we
suggest
that
there
is
another
possibility
for
a
test
and
that
would
be
in
a
stricter
application,
looking
directly
at
the
statute
and
if
the
statute
has
a
possibility
at
all
of
imprisonment,
that
then
counsel
must
be
provided
if
the
person
is
indigent.
if
that
were
the
rule
to
be
handed
down
by
this
case
--
this
court,
i
would
hope
that
the
american
juris
prudence
system
would
take
he,
the
president
nixon’s
latest
comments
on
this,
on
legal
reform
and
that
we
proceed
to
eliminate
from
the
possibility
of
incarceration,
many
of
these
minor
crimes,
where
there
is
no
victim.
i
think
that
i
will
save
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
for
the
state.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
understand
how
we
convict
anything
less
than
one
day.
how
can
we
arbitrarily
say
that
1
day,
30
days
or
60
days.
to
the
man
that
sitting
in
jail,
that
decision
is
completely
arbitrary.
i
also
would
offer
that
there
is
no
logical
reason
for
picking
60
days
or
90
days
or
six
months.
as
to
some
of
the
points
that
mr.
georgieff
raised,
i
believe
there
is
now
a
florida
statute
that
was
recently
passed
in
our
last
session
that
makes
county
ordinances
is
the
same
as
misdemeanors
and
that
is
a
session
law
of
70-453,
sub-section
something
or
other.
i
also
want
to
try
to
make
it
clear
that
our
position
is
that,
we
do
not
feel
that
it
is
necessary
to
make
the
counsel
appointment
that
will
not
result
to
the
counsel
appointed
in
all
of
misdemeanor
cases,
only
those
where
each
practical
possibilities
that
the
person
may
receive
some
incarceration.
i
think
that
the
position
of
the
fifth
circuit
was
a
bit
misleading,
as
far
as
the
state
was
presented.
they
said
that
the
fifth
circuit
has
a
90
days
rule.
i
do
not
think
that
is
quite
the
case.
the
fifth
circuit
has
ruled
on
a
case
in
which
they
said
a
person
charged
with
an
offense
that
received
90
days
should
be
given
a
right
to
counsel,
but
i
think
they
left
the
bottom
into
that
open
and
they
have
only
ruled
in
the
other
cases
on
similar
special
circumstances.
in
conclusion,
i
think
that
it
is
evident
that
our
position
and
that
of
the
states
is
not
that
far
apart.
they
have
not
come
before
you
this
morning
and
suggested
that
a
man
not
be
given
the
right
to
counsel
in
misdemeanors.
they
have
only
suggested
that
it
should
be
either
six
months
and
now
they
have
come
with
another
possibility
of
60
days.
we
feel
that
the
only
real
test
is
to
go
completely
as
the
constitution
says.
a
person
who
is
in
the
position
of
a
possible
incarceration
must
be
given
the
right
to
counsel.
and
if
he
is
not
given
that
right,
he
cannot
be
sent
to
prison.
it
is
that
simple,
that
is
our
test.
no,
attorney
--
mr.
j.
michael
shea
correct
sir.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
no
sir,
i
think
that,
that
is
another
situation
that
we
get
into;
contempts
and
things
of
that
nature
and
if
a
person
did
not
pay
the
fine
then
he
would,
i
assume
be
charged
with
a
contempt
violation
and
in
fact,
would
be
afforded
an
attorney.
so,
i
think
that
the
possibility
of
a
person
getting
up
here
with
that
argument
is
a
much
more
remote.
our
suggestion,
to
boil
it
down
in
its
simplest
form,
is
no
attorney,
no
jail.
i
think
the
greatest
freedom
that
we
have
in
this
country
is
our
liberty
and
when
a
man
is
afforded
counsel,
it
is
the
only
method
he
has
of
protecting
that
liberty
when
he
stands
on
our
courts.
if
we
take
that
right
away,
we
also
take
his
liberty
away.
to
say
less
is
to
compromise
the
freedoms
of
our
constitution.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir,
i
am.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
i
think
they
are
unconstitutional,
as
they
apply
to
the
right
to
counsel.
they
are
strict
violation
of
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
and
i
do
not
feel
that
they
specifically
go
to
the
question
and
i
think
it
is
only
a
reference
in
a
form
of
a
negative
pregnant
and
i
hope
--
mr.
j.
michael
shea
no
sir,
i
think
that
was
my
original
answer
when
i
was
asked
that
question
before.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
i
think
they
are
unconstitutional.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
because
they
are
in
violation
of
the
constitution.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
because,
the
constitution
says
that
a
person
shall
have
the
right
to
counsel.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
in
all
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
well,
i
think
that
the
only
way
that
it
can
construed
that
they
do
say
that
is
through
that
negative
pregnant
and
i
would
suggest
that
is
a
cool
way
of
putting
this
question
to
bid.
i
do
not
read
it
that
way
myself.
mr.
j.
michael
shea
as
affecting
the
right
to
counsel,
but
if
it
does
--
mr.
j.
michael
shea
that
is
right
sir.
if
it
is
read
that
way
and
on
the
alternative
if
it
is
--
i
would
suggest
that
if
it
possible
that
the
other
construction
could
be
read
and
if
that
be
the
case,
then
it
is
our
position
that
they
are
unconstitutional.
any
further
questions
sir?
mr.
j.
michael
shea
thank
you
sir.
