then
is
the
matter
what
the
label
maybe
on
the
defense,
if
it
carries
six
months
or
more?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

no.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
it
carries
more
than
six
months?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
for
that,
i
have
gather,
if
the
offense
is
limited
to
more
than
six
months
publicity,
is
it
still
labeled
that
misdemeanor
or
do
you
have
other
labeling?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and,
i
suppose
it
carries
more
than
six
months?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

how
about
traffic
offenses,
they
have
any
advantage
to
carry
between
six
and
--
justice

(voice

justice
william
j.
brennan,

so
it
is
under
state
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
now
you
want
us
to
understand
this
recent
decision
as
meaning
and
all
those
instances,
counsel
would
have
to
be
provided?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
has
there
been
any
effort
they
provide
the
figures
as
to
what
this
will
mean,
in
terms
of
the
number
of
assignments
that
they
will
have
to
be
made?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
that
test
under
(inaudible)
for
example.
is
the
test
whether
or
not
the
offense
may
carry
over
six
months
or
is
the
test
whether
in
fact,
punishment
imposed
is
more
than
six
months?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
what?
is
made?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
do
not
see
it
otherwise,
it
can
operate.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
one
last
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
your
submission
do
our
stand
that
the
constitution
requires
provision
for
counsel
in
every
case
where
they
find
charged
may
carry
a
prison
sentence,
however
long
or
however
short?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though
the
ordinance
or
the
statute
as
the
case
maybe,
may
say
for
that
kind
of
offense,
a
criminal
or
rather
a
prison
terms
maybe
imposed
for
30
days
or
50
days
as
case
maybe?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though
the
statute
said
so?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let
us
see
mr.
georgieff.
i
gather
your
provision
does
not
reach
all
these
metro
offenses
on
all
the
types?
