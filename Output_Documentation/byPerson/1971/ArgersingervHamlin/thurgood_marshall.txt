justice
thurgood
marshall
what
happens,
if
it
never
happens
before
with
this
man
gets
two
years?
what
happens
to
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
say
that
statistics,
whether
a
man
is
entitled
to
a
lawyer,
i
am
saying
that
statistics
show
that
this
crime,
nobody
in
the
united
states
has
ever
gone
to
jail
for
any
crime.
it
was
all
been
found,
but
mr.
a,
is
given
two
years,
would
that
be
a
legal
conviction
without
the
counsel?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
is
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
do
you
cover
those
two
cases?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
get
worried
with
this
legality
by
statistics
of
constitutionality
by
statistics
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
county
in
some
of
upstate,
i
mean,
like
in
upstate
new
york
where
a
group,
where
all
the
lawyers
are
either
one
or
two
lawyer
practitioners
and
that
if
you
get
in,
they
got
only
these
farmers,
they
came
in
to
judge
and
said
if
we
keep
going
this
way,
you
go
appointing
indigent
lawyers
to
defend
indigent
clients.
what
--
i
mean,
the
whole
point
is
there
is
a
problem
in
areas
like
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
should
not
(inaudible)
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
are
you
going
compare
that
with,
no
lawyer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
competent
lawyer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
now
in
these
cases
we
are
talking
about,
they
have
no
lawyers,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
wouldn't
a
law
school
student
be
better
than
no
lawyer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
i
guess
we
have
seen
cases
where
the
16
greatest
lawyers
that
ever
lived
wouldn't
save
them.[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
would
submit
that
we
might
get
to
those
when
we
get
there.
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
did
not
say
it
you
know.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
three
months
that
we
are
talking
about,
aren't
we?
justice
thurgood
marshall
six
months?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
what
we
are
talking
about?
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
are
not
talking
about
his
property
or
anything,
we're
talking
about
six
months
in
jail.
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
you
--
six
months
and
one
day,
is
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
an
arbitrary
line,
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
in
the
constitution
in
you
mind
that
limits
the
word
liberty,
it
says
liberty?
justice
thurgood
marshall
alright,
well
that
is
what
i
thought?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
cannot
waive
a
prosecutor,
okay?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
cannot
waive
a
prosecutor?[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
want
me
to
convince
me
that
the
average
person
charged
with
a
traffic
offense
wants
the
jury
of
his
fellow
drivers
to
trial?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
sure?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
happens,
if
it
never
happens
before
with
this
man
gets
two

what
happens
to
him?
