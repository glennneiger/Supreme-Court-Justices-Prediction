we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
number
5015,
argersinger
against
hamlin.
mr.
shea
you
may
precede
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
did
not
get
mr.
shea,
clearly,
just
what
it
was
you
said
about
change
in
the
handling
of
these
cases
in
florida
was
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
in
the
figures
you
gave
for
new
york,
if
you
show
how
many
of
them
could
have
been
of
the
sentence
for
over
the
six
months
period?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
we
know
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
you
would
have
to
come
around
to
the
test
that
has
been
suggested
as
one
possibility
in
various
reports
that
counsel
is
required
only
if
generally
or
usually
a
prison
sentence
is
imposed.
is
that
the
test
you
advocate?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
one?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
thought
you
had
responded
to
a
question
of
mr.
justice
stewart
that
in
every
case,
if
the
penalty
was
possible,
counsel
had
to
be
provided.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
will
that
pose
any
double
jeopardy
problems,
if
he
did
not
consent
to
the
new
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
shea.
mr.
georgieff?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
where
is
the
confinement
served?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
in
the
county
jail?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
georgieff,
mr.
shea,
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
heard
enough
mr.
shea.
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
70-5015,
argersinger
against
hamlin.
mr.
rogow
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
the
judge
at
the
outset,
under
a
rule
such
as
you
suggest,
concluded
in
his
own
mind
that
he
was
not
going
to
impose
any
sentence,
even
though
it
was
permitted
and
then
went
ahead
with
the
trial,
that
would
be
alright
under
your
theory,
would
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
imposed
on
your
client?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
then
if
he
imposed
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trial
he
concluded
that
he
changed
his
mind
that
either
the
offense
was
much
more
serious
than
he
had
at
first
thought
or
perhaps
probation
report
or
some
information
about
a
prior
record
came
to
his
notice
and
he
concluded
to
impose
the
sentence,
then
the
suggestion
of
offering
him
a
new
trial
comes
up.
what
is
your
response
to
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
you
said
no
thank
your
honor,
i
want
to
stand
on
the
trial
at
hand?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let's
assume
he
is
a
little
more
sophisticated
than
some
of
the
defendants,
that
he
answers
the
judge's
suggestion
by
saying,
no
thank
you
your
honor.
i
have
tried
my
case
as
well
i
was
think
it
can
be
tried
by
anyone
and
the
case
is
closed
and
it
is
your
decision,
except
he
makes
the
point
you
cannot
send
me
into
any
confinement
and
i
will
not
accept
a
new
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
do
not
see
any
double
jeopardy
problems,
even
if
at
the
outset
of
the
trial
he
had
asked
for
counsel
and
then
denied
it,
so
that
at
the
end
of
the
trial,
he
said
he
wanted
to
stand
on
that
trial
and
would
oppose
and
object
to
a
new
trial
on
any
term.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
my
assumption
is
that
at
the
outset
he
asked
for
counsel
and
the
judge
said
no
i
am
not
going
to
appoint
counsel.
the
judge
then
thinking
he
was
not
going
to
impose
any
confinement
and
in
my
hypothesis
the
judge
has
changed
his
mind
because
of
some
factor
intervening.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
be
--
would
it
be
rare
if
this
rule
were
structured
as
you
suggest?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
not
sure
i
have
got
that
(voice
overlap)
not
too
sure
i
got
you
figure
clear.
if
5,000
people
a
year
in
dade
county
can
go
to
some
kind
of
confinement
up
to
six
months.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
5,000
of
them.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
will
have
an
assumption
there
that
goes
a
little
to
speedily
for
me
that
is
that
the
lawyer
can
try
that
many.
now
when
the
lawyer
gets
into
a
case
the
case
of
the
litigation
tends
to
change
very
often,
i
assume
you
would
accept
that
is
a
realistic
fact?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
there
any
available,
reasonably
reliable
figures
on
these
propositions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
probability
of
confinement?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
observation
certainly
have
relevance
to
metropolitan
centers.
what
about
isolated
rural
areas
that
are
either
not
covered
by
any
legal
aid
defenders
system
at
all
or
one
that's
on
a
regional
basis
where
the
legal
aid
office
maybe
a
hundred
miles
away
from
a
particular
small
town
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
mobile
court
is
not
a
common
phenomenon
in
the
country
anymore,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
do
not
have
many
states
functioning
as
mississippi
does?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
several,
but
there
are
great
many
states
with
large
rural
areas
where
the
court
does
not
rule
in
just
away
your
talking
about,
i
am
sure
you
know
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
in
many
states
again
if
the
defendant
is
not
to
be
carried
in
the
same
court,
in
a
felony
court,
he
is
often
local
police
court
or
sometime,
more
often
than
that
i
would
think?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
then
your
suggestion
about
this
having
no
significant
impact
is,
it
has
to
be
diluted
a
little
bit,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
many,
in
terms
of
comparative
analysis,
how
many
truly
minor
trivial
crimes
are
covered
by
the
federal
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
for
magistrates?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
rogow.
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then
on

drawing
mr.

that
means
one

or
one

is
relative
to
six
months
and
(voice

chief

e.

well,
i
am
not

i
follow
your

about
the

do
you
link
court
reporter
as
an
imperative
in
every
case
where
there
is
a
lawyer
just
automatically.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
agree
that's
probably
a
greater
problem
than
the
problem
of
counsel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
a
federal
court
situation,
but
the
states
are
not
generally
in
that
posture,
are
they?
chief

by

chief

no,
we
are
talking
here
for
the
large
part
(voice

problems
exactly
--
chief
justice
warren
e.

are
you
sub

suggesting
that
this
court
has
some
supervisory
power
over
state
courts?
chief

warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
solicitor
general.
mr.
georgieff
if
you
need
some
additional
time
we
will
indulge
that,
but
you
have
been
here
before
on
this
subject
and
perhaps
you
would
not
need
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
i
do
not
know
that
counsel
for
the
party
has
abandoned
it,
the
(voice

authority
has
done
so.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
we
decide
the
case
on
some
of
the
grounds
that
--
chief

warren
e.

i
do
not
think
we
spent
much
in
the
original

on
that
subject
--
chief

warren
e.
burger
(voice

chief
justice
warren
e.

not
spend
anytime.
chief

that
means
you
get
counsel
before
you
go
to
that.
chief

e.

you
have
four
minutes
left
mr.
