mr.
george
r.
georgieff
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
guess
this
is
as
fitting
an
occasion
as
any
to
take
off
on
the
downside
of
gideon’s,
since
florida
opened
the
door
for
gideon
itself.
i
suspect
florida
is
the
proper
state
to
decide
whether
gideon
should
be
extended
downward.
hopefully,
the
result
would
not
be
the
same
as
it
was
in
gideon,
although
i
think
it
was
a
sound
one.
i
would
like
to
put
something
to
rest
before
we
get
too
far
into
it.
felonies
and
misdemeanor
as
defined
in
florida
as
of
today;
felonies
are
those
offenses
punishable
by
imprisonment
in
the
state
penitentiary.
now,
it
does
not
mean
that
they
must
be
so
incarcerated,
since
we
do
have
provisions
for
our
alternative
confinement
in
county
jails
for
offenses
five
years
or
less
in
term.
now,
misdemeanors
or
all
offenses
otherwise
punishable
by
confinement
in
the
county
jails.
everything
else
is
something
less
than
a
crime
in
florida.
it
is
neither
a
misdemeanor
nor
a
felony.
municipal
violation,
if
you
take
up
the
situation
in
dade
county,
you
have
metro
violations,
which
do
not
fit
either
bracket.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
metro,
it
is
called
metropolitan
government.
it
is
a
combination
of
those
cities,
which
decided
to
go
together
with
the
county.
now,
there
are
some
23,
as
i
understand
which
are
not
part
of
it
and
they
remained
isolated
municipalities
with
their
own
unit
of
governments.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
oh!
yes.
as
the
metro,
they
are
sui
generis
in
terms
of
miami
being
the
leader.
they
cannot
be
the
leader
in
that
situation,
but
they
are
all
less
than
misdemeanor.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
would
hazard
on
the
outside
now,
perhaps
mr.
shea
can
correct
me,
but
i
would
hazard
that
it
cannot
exceed
90
days
and
that
is
true
with
all
municipal
violations.
i
have
not
known
of
any
that
go
in
excess
of
that.
now,
conceivably
you
can
have
some
of
them
back-to-back,
which
would
result
in
a
longer
period
of
confinement,
but
the
maximum
on
the
outside
is
90
days.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
in
city
jail,
city
compounds,
it
is
something
on
that
order.
i
do
not
have
a
title
for
all
the
places
where
they
can
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no
sir.
now,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
are
many
times
in
the
rural
counties,
where
they
do
not
have
county
compounds.
they
often
by
arrangement
have
them
serve
in
one
city
that
may
exist.
for
instance,
in
place
like
liberty
county,
which
has
only
2800
people
in
it,
they
do
not
have
a
compound.
they
interchange
their
facility,
but
if
we
are
going
to
deal
with
the
labels,
i
want
t
straighten
that
much
out
first,
but
we
intend
to
throw
labels
out
the
window,
because
they
really
do
not
mean
anything
at
all.
you
said
so
in
goff
and
that
is
a
fact.
under
the
criminal
justice
act,
it
is
broken
by
congress
that
six-month
on
the
petty
offense
doctrine.
now,
after
the
decision
in
gideon
and
i
think
mr.
justice
stewart
after
several
times
when
you
suggested
that
perhaps
the
matter
of
misdemeanor
ought
to
be
treated
and
had
not
been,
the
supreme
court
of
florida
decided
in
fisher
versus
state
that
if
you
had
meant
the
gideon
should
apply
across
the
board
as
to
crimes
which
includes
both
misdemeanors
and
felonies
that
you
would
assess
them.
and
therefore,
they
held
that
the
counsel
was
not
an
organic
right
in
misdemeanor
situations,
no
matter
what.
now,
on
another
occasion
before
you,
i
advice
you
that
indeed
there
were
some
misdemeanors
in
florida,
though
there
have
been
no
prosecutions
under
it
and
that
carry
the
maximum
penalty,
would
you
believe
of
8
years.
and,
in
which
case
i
think
by
an
inquiry
from
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
replied
that
if
you
had
a
situation
like
that,
it
would
be
absurd
to
suggest
that
you
do
not
appoint
counsel
for
him,
because
of
the
terms
of
confinement.
now,
as
of
january
1,
1972,
all
that
will
be
wiped
out
by
the
passage
of
71-136,
which
is
a
general
reviser’s
bill
and
that
is
found
in
the
florida
session
law
service,
it
is
post
binder,
covered
in
pages
381
to
711
or
some
380
odd
pages
of
a
general
revision
of
the
criminal
code
of
florida.
they
breakdown
felonies
into
four
degrees;
capital
and
three
degrees
of
felonies.
they
break
misdemeanors
down
to
two
degrees
and
misdemeanors
are
broken
down
very
simple.
in
terms
of
time
and
or
money
fines,
for
a
misdemeanor
of
the
first
degree,
by
a
definite
term
of
imprisonment
in
the
county
jail
not
exceeding
one
year.
we
understand
that
under
the
decisions
of
the
fifth
circuit,
in
harvey
in
the
others
and
indeed
under
judge
mert's
decision
in
princeton
(ph),
where
he
breaks
it
in
six
months,
based
upon
the
criminal
justice
act
and
expecting
a
similar
treatment
as
to
federal
and
state
prisoners
that
certainly
everybody
in
florida,
as
of
january
1,
who
is
under
a
misdemeanor
of
the
first
degree,
is
going
to
get
in
counseled,
as
a
matter
of
course.
now,
for
a
misdemeanor
of
a
second
degree,
by
a
definite
term
of
imprisonment
in
the
county
jail,
not
exceeding
60
days.
now,
there
is
also
a
fine
provision,
which
sets
the
fine
at
$500,
but
obviously
after
you
reach
the
decision
that
you
did
not
take,
that
is
meaningless.
since,
if
he
is
indigent
and
cannot
pay
the
fine,
he
cannot
be
made
to
serve
more
than
60
days,
no
matter
how
you
could.
so,
we
are
now
in
the
posture
of
going
down
30
days
below
what
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
has
said
was
very
acceptable
petty
offense
line.
if
it
was
all
misdemeanors
before,
if
it
was
reduced
to
6
months
by
the
criminal
justice
act
and
by
the
state
of
florida
supreme
court
in
argersinger
and
even
if
the
federal
district
court
in
jacksonville
under
willie
(ph),
and
by
the
way
the
only
reason
they
are
not
advising
everybody
as
to
everything,
is
they
are
awaiting
the
outcome
of
your
decision
here
in
this
case
today.
now,
we
say
that
breaking
point
with
the
fifth
circuit
was
set
at
90
days.
we
set
it
ourselves
by
the
florida
supreme
court
relying
on
judge
mert's
decision
in
princeton
at
six
months
which
coincides
with
what
you
said,
in
baldwin
as
to
juries
and
with
the
criminal
justice
act
as
to
petty
offenses.
now,
the
question
becomes,
is
it
awesome
to
the
man
who
faces
some
kind
of
imprisonment
no
matter
what?
well,
somewhere
you
must
break
the
line.
there
was
no
command
at
the
time
that
argersinger
was
argued
there,
except
that
is
urged
here.
now,
i
do
not
know
how
far
we
can
break
it.
all
i
do
know
is
as
of
january
1,
they
are
only
going
to
be
a
handful
of
people
who
are
ever
processed
on
misdemeanor
charges
who
would
not
based
upon
the
imprisonment
possible
be
provided
counsel.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that
is
right.
now,
if
you
recall
under
waller
(ph),
of
course
metropolitan
community
and/or
cities
or
whatever
you
may
call
them
exist
at
the
sovereign
of
the
legislature.
no
laws
that
they
adopt
are
criminal
in
nature.
they
may
adopt
whatever
they
like
either
by
individual
or
charter
provisions
or
they
may
adopt
the
violations
of
the
state
law
as
city
ordinances,
but
they
must
set
independent
punishment
and
in
other
words,
the
reviser’s
bill
does
not
reach
them
any
degree.
i
tell
you,
as
a
matter
of
pure
fact,
although
it
is
not
in
the
record
here,
that
no
city
has
violations
to
my
knowledge,
that
had
ever
come
to
my
attention
that
exceed
90
days
for
a
violation
of
what
would
be
of
criminal
law
had
it
been
processed
in
the
state
or
by
the
county.
so,
in
the
last
analysis,
we
are
told
that
you
allow
people
to
come
into
court
with
the
lawyer
in
situations
of
their
own
hiring,
so
why
should
you
not
do
it
here,
no
matter
what
the
penalty
is,
and
if
you
would
do
and
if
we
use
this,
the
statistics
that
they
given
us
on
the
new
york
report
of
the
million
one
--
million
800
thousand
with
only
40
processed
to
the
degree
where
they
were
put
in
confinement.
if
anything
ever
sounded
like
de
minimis
to
me,
that
certainly
does.
now,
if
it
is
the
awesome
prospect
that
they
tell
us
that
it
is,
how
come
so
few
ever
wound
up
in
jail
as
a
result
of
it?
now,
i
think
mr.
justice
marshall’s
question
about
what
do
you
do
when
somebody
winds
up
on
the
short
end
of
a
theretofore
vacant
threat?
well
obviously,
the
answer
as
you
pose
mr.
justice
stewart
is
if
you
wind
up
with
a
situation
like
that,
that
is
easily
correctable.
we
grant
them
a
new
trial,
if
what
happened
to
him,
so
far
outstrip
what
anybody
expected
certainly
they
are
going
to
grant
him
a
new
trial,
there
is
not
any
question
about
it.
now,
i
do
not
know
how
often
that
is
going
to
occur
if
it
all.
they
are
now,
under
--
in
the
legislature,
in
a
special
session
this
very
day,
and
they
will
meet
in
general
session
in
february
to
take
up
of
all
the
things,
another
reviser’s
bill,
which
it
is
hoped
will
do
a
way
with
most,
if
not
all
of
the
victimless
crimes.
now,
that
would
not
do
away
with
the
dwis
or
anything
like
that,
assuming
anybody
is
injured
or
there
is
a
substantial
amount
of
property
damage.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
driving
while
intoxicated
or
under
the
influence.
now,
many
of
the
minor
violations,
such
as
drunkenness,
loitering
and
i
do
not
know
what
all
are
will
--
if
this
goes
through
be
wiped
out.
now,
what
that
will
do
statistically
to
the
problem
posed,
as
suggested
by
petitioners,
i
do
not
know.
but
if
we
do
away
with
victimless
crimes,
we
are
going
to
do
away
for
the
most
part
with
what
was
the
object
of
your
concern
in
tate
and
other
cases,
similar
to
it.
i
submit
that
it
is
not
anywhere
near
the
problem
suggested.
i
submit
that
the
congress
did
not
think
that
it
was.
i
submit
that
not
even
the
fifth
circuit
thinks
that
it
should
be
extended
below
the
90-day
breaking
line
that
they
adopted.
but
even
if
it
is,
florida
has
broken
in
at
60
days,
as
of
january
1,
1972
and
for
all
the
world,
nothing
i
have
heard
here
today,
gives
me
any
reason
to
suspect
that
what
was
done
with
regard
in
mr.
argersinger
in
the
florida
supreme
court
should
in
be
modified
by
any
decision
that
you
render
here
today.
i
know
that
somebody
says
by
one
day,
he
lost
the
benefit
of
counsel,
but
wherever
you
would
draw
the
line,
assuming
it
is
not
all
the
way
down
to
the
basement,
somebody
is
going
to
lose
by
one
day.
presumably,
if
you
set
the
limit
at
58
days,
surely
an
artful
legislature
would
say,
well,
let
us
make
it
57,
and
it
would
be
a
never
ending
battle.
so,
i
do
not
know
that
one
day
makes
the
difference.
i
know
that
the
doctrine
of
petty
offense
has
to
mean
something.
certainly,
the
congress
was
not
stupid
when
they
adopted
it
nor
was
the
fifth
circuit
stupid
when
they
said
that
we
think
90
days,
is
a
good
place
at
which
to
break
it.
i
think
judge
mert's
was
aptly
justified
in
breaking
it
at
the
six
months
suggested
by
the
criminal
justice
act
of
1964.
since,
it
does
coincide
and
since
that
is
what
the
florida
supreme
court
relied
on
and
there
is
really
no
predicate
for
deciding
that
there
ought
to
be
a
departure
below
the
six-month
petty
offense
rule
and
in
the
last
analysis
since
florida
is
not
going
to
be
imposing
these
awesome
burdens
at
any
time
after
january
1,
i
think
the
action
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
should
be
affirmative
in
this
case.
thank
you.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
i
do
not
know
that
an
individual
stands
in
any
different
posture
with
it
before
a
us
magistrate
than
he
does
when
he
is
before
a
county
judge
of
the
state
or
for
that
matter
of
that
wherever
he
may
be,
where
a
confinement
is
going
to
run
no
more
than
6
months.
if
it
satisfactory
for
an
individual
before
us
magistrate,
i
should
imagine
that
it
is
meaningless
to
an
individual
anywhere
else
to
tell
him
do
not
worry
about
the
rope
burning,
it
is
made
out
of
linen,
instead
of
a
hem.
that
is
just
another
reason,
i
think,
mr.
justice
stewart
why
to
make
a
false
distinction
simply
because
it
has
its
genesis
in
the
state
proceeding
would
be
untoward.
there
is
no
reason
to
tell
an
individual
being
processed
in
a
criminal
system
that
it
is
different
in
one
area
and
he
is
entitled
to
counsel
there
then
it
is
in
another
where
he
is
not
simply
by
rules
adopted
either
by
this
court
or
by
the
congress.
i
think
the
posture
is
the
same.
a
jail
cell
is
a
jail
cell
is
a
jail
cell.
now,
i
do
not
stand
ready,
willing
or
able
to
tell
that
an
individual
ought
to
like
it
for
one
day.
i
am
sure
none
of
them
do,
but
if
we
are
going
to
live
in
a
world
with
people
who
serve
it
and
if
they
are
going
to
be
enough
of
them
to
go
around,
then
i
think
an
intelligent
break
is
made
up
of
six-month
petty
offense
situation
and
hopefully
by
the
time
they
are
finished
you
will
agree
with
that
and
affirm
the
action
below.
i
hope
that
answers
your
question
sir?
thank
you.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
do
think
i'll
need
it.
if
i
cannot
make
it
in
the
time
allotted
i
guess
i
would
better
give
it
up
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
us
to
remember
what
happen
here
before.
the
court
had
cast
upon
it
the
question
of
whether
you
should
consider
this
matter
in
light
of
the
sixth
amendment.
now
they
have
abandoned
that
and
we
have
come
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
let
me
assume
for
the
moment
that
if
i
can
get
to
that,
and
demonstrate
to
you
why
the
sixth
amendment
doesn't
cover
the
situation
will
be
left
with
the
fourteenth
and
then
hopefully
i
can
dissect
it
as
the
solicitor's
office
has
done,
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
setting
out
the
reasons
why
you
should
adopt
it
as
the
predicate
for
the
action
sought
here.
now
as
to
the
sixth
amendment,
mr.
rogow
has
told
you
that
the
reason
that
you
needn't
separate
the
two
is
because
after
all
you
have
said
that
a
jury
trial
is
really
not
quite
as
necessary
to
a
fair
trial
as
is
a
lawyer
and
yet
we
find
that
you
can
waive
both
rights
and
we
hear
from
the
solicitor’s
office
that
what
you
really
ought
to
have
to
save
this
people
if
you
find
that
by
(inaudible)
the
horribles
you
are
going
to
have
horrendous
situation
is
to
get
a
non
lawyers
but
para
legals
or
preachers
or
social
workers
or
somebody
like
that.
now
you
either
going
to
give
them
lawyers
or
you
are
not
going
to
give
them
lawyers.
now
i
understand
that
deans
and
formers
deans
are
very
proud
of
law
students
and
i
understand
that
sometimes
judges
are,
working
lawyers
for
the
states
know
that
the
greatest
number
of
complaints
about
inefficient
counsel
come
in
those
areas.
our
complaints
in
not
regard
and
we
handle
them
all
in
our
office
for
the
state
of
florida
have
increased
1400%.
since
there
has
been
that
kind
of
supervisory
service
rendered
by
supervised
law
students.
now
what
an
appellate
court
does
with
them
is
meaningless.
i
am
telling
you
about
the
complaints
that
come.
now
they
come
with
the
lawyers
just
as
well
as
they
do
without.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
in
light
of
the
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
you
have
to
compare
it
in
terms
of
the
competent
lawyer
i
am
sure.
what
are
the
basis
do
we
have
sir?
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
or
to
the
man
who
winds
in
jail
as
as
the
result
of
bad
service,
i
do
not
guess
it
makes
any
different
what
you
get.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
i
am
satisfied.
i
do
not
need
split
here.
what
i
am
saying
is
if
we
make
it
turn
on
the
awesome
spectrum
if
having
to
go
to
jail
for
even
one
day,
it
is
meaningless
to
tell
me
that
an
isolated
area
where
actually
no
real
harm
is
going
to
be
done
to
the
individual
because
he
batted
somebody
around
what
you
really
need
to
give
this
somebody
less
than
a
lawyer
because
after
all
he
is
only
going
to
get
three
to
four
days,
that
is
meaningless
to
him.
if
you
are
asked
to
believe
the
other
part,
now
if
we
are
going
to
believe
one
part
then
we
ought
to
take
it
all
and
none
at
all.
if
it's
so
awesome
a
prospect
that
it
did
not
keep
you
from
deciding
that
in
your
practice
before
a
magistrates
you
ought
to
break
it
off
at
six
months
then
i
submit
you
ought
to
give
him
counsel
or
tried
and
through
in
the
past
of
our
somewhere
and
allowed
and
able
to
practice.
then
if
they
complain,
we
will
have
to
measure
them
as
against
all
other
lawyers
in
the
general
community.
but
if
we
go
to
the
fourteenth,
how
do
we
carve
about
property
and
what
do
we
do
with
it.
when
foreclose
against
somebody
who
now
loses
the
house,
his
kids
have
got
nowhere
to
stay,
nowhere
to
go,
we
will
give
him
counsel
under
due
process.
on
the
fines,
what
do
we
do
about
the
fines,
what
we
will
do
with
tate.
you
cannot
fine
an
indigent
and
then
if
he
does
not
pay
it
stick
him
in
jail
for
not
pay
it.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no
i
understand
that,
but
to
say
that
we
say
that
the
reason
you
ought
to
give
them
lawyers
is
because
imprisonment
is
the
prospect,
relies
what
you
said
in
tate,
that
is
to
say
you
cannot
fine
a
man
who
is
indigent
and
then
because
he
cannot
pay
it,
stick
him
in
jail
as
penalty
therefore.
now
that
is
here
and
it's
already
been
ruled
on.
now,
if
you
cannot
put
him
in
jail
for
non
payment
of
the
fine
and
if
you
cannot
fine
him
because
you
know
he
cannot
pay
it,
then
truly
you
have
got
a
super
class.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
six
months
in
his
case.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no
but
the
argument,
no
i
understand,
but
the
argument
advanced
here
today
by
both
parties,
by
counsel
for
the
party
and
by
amicus
is
that
you
break
it
at
a
fine.
the
only
time
the
problem
ever
comes
up
is
when
you
have
the
imprisonment
as
the
prospect.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that
is
right.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
all
lines
are
arbitrary.
somebody
drop
(voice
overlap)
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no
not
in
my
mind.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
i
mean
i
do
not
think
you
draw
a
line
about
liberty,
liberty
if
it's
curtailed,
it's
curtailed,
no
quarrel
about
that.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that
is
right.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
just
it
says
life
and
liberty
and
property.
now,
if
you
are
going
to
give
him
counsel
in
one,
you
got
to
give
it
to
him
in
all
unless
you
can
take
a
sharpest
scalp
they
seem
to
use
and
carve
it
out
and
say
why
you
get
it
one
and
not
in
the
other.
now,
i
submit
that
confinement
for
one
day
for
a
man
who
commits
a
running
violation
in
a
vehicle
is
far
less
meaningful
in
terms
of
harm
to
him
or
far
less
meaningful
than
is
the
loss
of
one's
house
on
a
foreclosure
when
he
cannot
gather
up
money
together
so
have
a
lawyer
around
and
get
him
to
come
in
and
do
something
about
if
he
can.
that
is
an
awesome
prospect
to
him,
but
they
say
well
we
do
not
care
about
money
fines
and
we
do
not
care
about
this.
all
we
care
about
is
slamming
a
door
on
him
for
one
day
or
perhaps
for
an
hour
for
all
we
know.
so
i
do
not
how
they
managed
to
cut
it
out.
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
oh
no
i
would
hope
you
can,
certainly.
you
can
waive
jury,
you
can
waive
everything,
you
waive
speedy
trial.
now
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
dade
county
was
mentioned
when
the
figure
of
400,000
was
used.
the
last
time
we
argued
this
case
i
told
you
that
in
terms
of
what
it
would
mean
to
florida,
we
have
dropped
down
to
well
60%
below
what
would
be
the
rule
if
we
adopted
as
the
basis
for
your
future
decision,
what
you
did
in
adopting
the
rules
for
your
practice
before
magistrates.
we
are
down
to
60
days
on
our
split
misdemeanors
if
you
recall.
now
on
the
march
14,
in
florida
along
with
the
number
of
people
who
think
they
are
going
to
find
out
who
is
going
to
be
the
presidential
nominee
for
either
the
democrats
or
republican,
we
wrote
on
article
5
which
is
re-vamping
of
the
court
structure
in
the
state
of
florida.
one
of
the
provisions
that
will
be
voted
on
is
the
total
abolition
of
all
municipal
courts
in
the
state.
you
do
not
have
long
to
wait
once
you
get
to
the
fourteenth,
one
day
beyond
that
the
canvassing
board
will
certify
the
results
we
won't
even
have
any
municipal
courts.
so
remembering
what
it
was
down
to
60
days
in
florida
by
our
legislature
we
are
down
even
below
what
was
done
in
willy
in
the
jacksonville
district
court.
we
are
certainly
down
below
what
was
done
in
mcdonald
and
harvey
and
we
are
certainly
down
below
what
would
be
the
basis
if
we
use
your
procedure
before
magistrates.
we
get
away
with
municipal
courts
and
we
are
down
to
what?
we
are
down
to
county
courts
which
will
be
the
second
strata
of
what
we
get
if
article
5
is
adopted,
now
i
am
sure
that
it
will
be,
but
who
knows
what
the
voters
will
do.
but
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
that's
so.
what
do
we
do
now
about
speedy
trials.
400,000
in
dade
county,
that's
only
in
metro,
that
does
not
take
into
a
count
the
23
cities
which
if
this
article
does
not
pass
will
still
function.
so
we
are
talking
about
better
than
600,000,
but
in
the
rural
communities,
we
do
not
have
to
go
to
north
dakota.
brisco
is
the
county
seat
of
liberty
county,
florida,
there
are
2800
people
in
the
whole
county.
there
has
not
been
a
lawyer
there
for
over
30
years.
now,
i'll
admit
that
they
have
a
circuit
court
that
sits
occasionally
when
they
have
litigation,
but
as
to
those
individuals
who
violate
the
ordinances
of
the
city
there
is
no
one
to
whom
they
can
go
and
there
is
no
one
in
the
court
to
whom
they
can
turn
for
an
appointment
because
there
is
nobody
around.
there
simply
aren't
any
lawyers
and
there
is
no
reason
from
them
to
be
there.
what
do
we
do
for
them?
do
we
say
well
now
you
are
going
to
have
to
wait
until
the
circuit
court
gets
here,
so
that
he
can
appoint
somebody
to
represent
you
and
represent
you
where
in
the
municipal
court,
in
the
county
court,
how
long
will
it
be
before
you
get
to
hearing.
it
got
so
bad
in
liberty
county
that
governor
collins
many
years
ago
had
to
order
them
to
hold
the
term
of
court
because
they
solved
their
business
without
even
going
to
court.
they
decided
who
would
do
what,
and
nobody
seem
any
worse
for
it.
i
do
not
have
the
case
that
is
a
good
notion.
all
i
am
telling
you
that
these
are
things
that
do
occur.
after
the
dickey
decision,
the
florida
supreme
court
decided
to
adopt
a
rule
regarding
speedy
trials
which
they
did.
they
broke
it
into
the
180
days
cold
or
on
demand
60
days.
i
got
so
bad
in
dade
county
which
is
the
source
of
the
400,000
figure
mr.
rogow
gave
you,
that
the
state
attorney's
office
had
to
make
a
special
plea
to
the
florida
supreme
court
to
extend
the
deadline
on
it
because
otherwise
690
man
would
get
a
walk
out
because
they
could
not
meet
the
deadline
which
they
did
by
the
way.
so
piecemeal
they
had
to
make
an
adjustment.
how
much
time
do
you
give
a
man
for
a
speedy
trial
who
faces
the
prospect
of
three
days,
five
days,
ten
days,
i
do
not
know.
you
certainly
cannot
make
it
much
longer
than
the
time
he
would
spend
in
jail
if
he
ever
got
there,
where
it'd
be
meaningless
to
him,
and
if
you
do
mean
to
make
a
speedy
situation
where
do
you
get
the
help.
the
court
reporters
--
you
give
the
man
a
lawyer
free
and
i
guarantee
you
that
he'll
not
only
take
it,
but
he'll
demand
an
appeal
if
he
losses
and
a
lawyer
to
handle
an
appeal
or
a
trial
de
novo,
no
matter
which,
you
do
not
have
to
have
a
court
report.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
oh!
certainly.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
all
felonies
with
the
exception
of
capital
and
just
recently
those
punishable
by
life
imprisonment
have
always
been
bailable
as
a
matter
of
right,
but
that
did
not
stop
the
speedy
trial
demand.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that
is
possibly
so
but
it
is
only
because
of
the
amount
of
the
bail.
in
my
heavenly
days
we
are
from
the
a
severe
state
of
in
terms
of
bail.
you
wind
up
with
anything
over
$7500
bail
then
it
is
a
miracle.
it
just
does
not
happen
because
they
are
not
a
attuned
to
high
bail
in
florida.
now
i
think
--
there
are
host
of
problems,
no
one
of
rich
can
be
answered.
now,
the
solicitor
comes
before
you
and
talks
in
terms
of
a
150,000
cases.
that
maybe
and
it
maybe
that
for
the
federal
system
it
would
be
virtually
a
piece
of
cake,
but
in
terms
of
just
those
half
a
handful
of
states,
you
have
been
told
the
figure
is
12
that
leaves
38
of
12
is
accurate
but
i
think
mr.
rogow
will
have
to
tell
you
that
of
those
12
it
is
tough,
well,
if
there
is
even
one
that
says
if
an
individual
faces
the
possible
prospect
of
one
day's
confinement
we
will
provide
him
free
counsel,
if
he
is
indigent,
i'll
bet
he'll
tell
you
no.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
do
not
think
even
in
minnesota.
now
it
is
just
a
guess
i
would
not
want
to
be
hung
by
it
but
it
occurs
to
me
that
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
if
we
are
talking
about
38
states,
let
assume
the
12
is
the
correct
figure,
if
we
are
talking
to
about
38
states
i
submit
they
ought
to
have
a
better
spokesman
than
me
concerning
my
history
before
this
court.
now
and
they
want
to
rely
on
the
solicitor
but
they
ought
to
have
a
better
spokesman
than
me
and
they
ought
to
be
give
an
opportunity
to
come
to
you
and
tell
you
what
it
is
they
have
in
terms
of
a
peculiar
problem
and
many
in
prison
that
made
about
statistics
that
would
support
this
better
than
other.
and
it
does
seem
to
me
that
it
is
not
an
easy
question
no
matter
which
course
you
follow.
but
certainly
if
it
did
not
disturb
you
in
grafting
the
procedure
to
be
followed
before
magistrates
to
break
the
line
at
six
months
on
the
petty
offense
and
if
the
brenson
decision
relying
on
that,
another
position
is
accurate.
if
a
jury
break
down
is
accurate
at
this
then
it
occurs
to
me
that
if
our
own
fifth
circuit
and
if
our
own
federal
district
court
by
the
way
breaks
it
in
90
days
and
if
we
have
broke
in
at
60
then
we
will
probably
reduce
it
even
further
then
it
seems
to
me
that
we
are
all
talking
about
something
that
really
is
far
less
in
terms
of
a
horrible
prospect
then
we
made
it
out
to
be.
now
talking
about
the
aba;
it
is
a
very
compelling
organization
and
much
of
what
they
have
done
has
proved
to
be
some
law
in
the
future.
mr.
chief
justice
you
may
not
remember
out
of
jackson
hole,
wyoming,
when
we
were
out
there
with
the
ten
circuit
sometime
ago
shortly
after
you
took
your
chair,
but
the
minimum
standards
committee
serving
florida
has
just
submitted
it
is
a
matter
to
the
florida
bar
for
inclusion
in
the
journal
and
it
will
be
presented
to
the
florida
supreme
court.
no
where
does
it
include
anything
about
providing
counsel
for
indigents
at
this
level,
no
where.
i
served
on
that
committee
as
its
vice-chairman.
now
it
maybe
that
somebody
will
initiate
something
like
that
in
florida
and
remember
i
am
speaking
for
florida,
not
for
any
of
the
other
38
or
magically
the
12
that
make
up
the
total
of
50,
but
i
will
tell
you
that
if
it
is
a
recommendation,
it
still
has
not
reached
florida
as
well.
now
somebody
else
may
put
it
out
in
that
fashion,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
if
we
are
going
to
provide
people
with
lawyers,
it
better
be
lawyers
and
not
ministers
or
anything
like
that.
if
we
are
going
to
provide
lawyers
which
we
are
assured
will
be
here
in
the
next
12
or
13
years,
may
would
go
to
eight
12
or
13
years
to
find
out
not
only
if
they
are
there,
but
if
the
problem
that
is
posed
is
really
the
problem
that
is
urged
and
if
there
is
such
problem,
whether
it
can
be
solve
in
a
fashion
that
we
can
even
accommodate,
we
do
not
have
the
physical
room
for
this
people.
we
are
told
that
we
have
created
the
defenders
system
right
after
gideon,
that
is
true.
we
had
seven
days
after
your
decisions
state
wide.
we
were
the
first
ones
to
respond
in
that
fashion
and
fittingly
since
gideon
came
from
florida,
you
are
told
now
that
the
defenders
can
pick
up
ten
times
as
many
misdemeanor
prosecutions
and
handle
them
with
relative
ease.
now
is
that
because
those
cases
are
ten
times
easier
or
because
they
will
give
them
only
one
tenth
of
the
time
necessary.
if
they
are
all
as
horrible
as
they
say,
nobody
sitting
in
this
room
today
ought
to
be
able
to
convince
you
that
they
only
work
one
tenth
of
a
time,
simply
because
the
sentence
involved
maybe
minimum.
to
the
individual
going
to
jail,
as
i
said
before
in
response
to
your
question,
i
cannot
break
the
line
at
liberty
and
it
is
meaningful
to
him
if
he
decides
that
he
has
been
done
in
by
law
enforcement,
if
somebody
been
try
to
do
him
in
and
he
wants
representation
and
if
he
is
innocent
by
golly
anytime
he
spends
in
jail
is
terrible
to
him.
and
to
somebody
who
can
say
well
now
look,
the
felony
is
important
you
know
of
being,
either
they
caught
him
coming
out
of
the
window,
this
is
going
to
take
a
day
and
a
half,
i'll
have
to
pick
to
jury.
truth
to
the
matter
is
we
assured
there
aren't
going
to
be
any
jury,
do
not
you
believe
that.
we
wind
up
without
any
municipal
courts
and
they
are
tried
in
a
county
court,
you
are
going
to
see
jury
trials
and
you
are
going
to
see
them
in
alarming
frequency.
there
is
no
question
about
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact
right
now
in
florida
on
traffic
violations
in
municipal
courts
you
have
an
option
at
which
you
can
request
a
trial
in
a
county
court
with
a
jury.
now
that
is
an
exercise
too
often
because
it
involves
money
and
lawyers
but
the
moment
they
find
that
they
can
have
they
are
going
to
exercise
it
just
as
rapidly
and
quickly
as
they
can.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
if
they
can
have
it
oh
sure.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
oh
sure.
i
am
certain
of
it.[laughter]
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
if
we
arrived
that
the
jury
trial
at
six
months
or
greater
that
should
be
the
same
predicate
for
the
counsel
(voice
overlap)
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
no
i
don't
--
no,
your
honor
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
it
will
ultimately
find
its
way
to
you
and
you
are
going
to
have
to
slap
us
down,
because
we
do
not
give
them
that
is
not
what
i
mean.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that
is
correct.
all
i
am
saying
is
that
we
will
be
confronted
with
the
problem
and
since
i
say
i
do
only
speak
for
florida
then
it
recurs
to
us.
for
more
then
several
reasons,
not
only
those
that
i
have
advanced
here.
but
it
does
seem
to
me
that
there
is
been
less
of
the
reason
advanced
here
on
this
occasion,
more
people
talking,
saying
more
things,
but
not
as
much
reason
as
was
advanced
the
first
time
and
accordingly
whatever
you
do
as
to
mr.
argensinger
certainly
if
he
is
re-tried
he
will
be
given
counsel,
but
that
is
under
own
statute
right
now
and
under
our
own
florida
supreme
rule
in
this
very
case.
so
that
if
he
were
retried
he
had
his
lawyer.
it
isn't
the
question
what
happens
to
argensinger,
it
is
a
question
what
happens
to
all
the
others
that
are
sure
to
follow
and
i
might
add
he
could
have
had
the
new
trial
because
there
was
an
admitted
boykin
violation
in
the
processing
of
his
own
case
which
was
stipulated
to
by
the
state
in
the
florida
supreme
court
and
we
said
so
in
our
brief.
so
it
isn't
a
problem
of
whether
he
gets
his
review,
that
is
not
really
what
they
have,
so
much
it
is
the
overall
quest.
thank
you.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
of
course,
you
mean
on
the
boykin
violation
no
question
about
that,
i
would
be
delighted.
i
would
like
to
somebody
else
have
a
chance
to
extend
gideon
doctrine
rather
than
florida.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
not
at
all.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
they
what?
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
do
not
quite
that
mean.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
would
rather
not
avoid
it
and
yet
i
do
not
really
know
how
to
answer
it
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well
no
i
quite
understand
but
would
you
believe
that
the
day
after
the
opinion
came
out
why
they
descended
on
our
office
and
wanted
to
know
what
it
was
we
could
do
to
draft
on
that
would
be
found
acceptable
and
so
far
i
told
them
i
have
to
go
to
washington
and
i
could
not
spend
anytime
on
it
i
hope
somebody
else
could
but
hopefully
--thank
you.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
guess
this
is
as
fitting
an
occasion
as
any
to
take
off
on
the
downside
of
gideon’s,
since
florida
opened
the
door
for
gideon
itself.
i
suspect
florida
is
the
proper
state
to
decide
whether
gideon
should
be
extended
downward.
hopefully,
the
result
would
not
be
the
same
as
it
was
in
gideon,
although
i
think
it
was
a
sound
one.
i
would
like
to
put
something
to
rest
before
we
get
too
far
into
it.
felonies
and
misdemeanor
as
defined
in
florida
as
of
today;
felonies
are
those
offenses
punishable
by
imprisonment
in
the
state
penitentiary.
now,
it
does
not
mean
that
they
must
be
so
incarcerated,
since
we
do
have
provisions
for
our
alternative
confinement
in
county
jails
for
offenses
five
years
or
less
in
term.
now,
misdemeanors
or
all
offenses
otherwise
punishable
by
confinement
in
the
county
jails.
everything
else
is
something
less
than
a
crime
in
florida.
it
is
neither
a
misdemeanor
nor
a
felony.
municipal
violation,
if
you
take
up
the
situation
in
dade
county,
you
have
metro
violations,
which
do
not
fit
either
bracket.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
metro,
it
is
called
metropolitan
government.
it
is
a
combination
of
those
cities,
which
decided
to
go
together
with
the
county.
now,
there
are
some
23,
as
i
understand
which
are
not
part
of
it
and
they
remained
isolated
municipalities
with
their
own
unit
of
governments.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
oh!
yes.
as
the
metro,
they
are
sui
generis
in
terms
of
miami
being
the
leader.
they
cannot
be
the
leader
in
that
situation,
but
they
are
all
less
than
misdemeanor.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
would
hazard
on
the
outside
now,
perhaps
mr.
shea
can
correct
me,
but
i
would
hazard
that
it
cannot
exceed
90
days
and
that
is
true
with
all
municipal
violations.
i
have
not
known
of
any
that
go
in
excess
of
that.
now,
conceivably
you
can
have
some
of
them
back-to-back,
which
would
result
in
a
longer
period
of
confinement,
but
the
maximum
on
the
outside
is
90
days.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
in
city
jail,
city
compounds,
it
is
something
on
that
order.
i
do
not
have
a
title
for
all
the
places
where
they
can
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no
sir.
now,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
are
many
times
in
the
rural
counties,
where
they
do
not
have
county
compounds.
they
often
by
arrangement
have
them
serve
in
one
city
that
may
exist.
for
instance,
in
place
like
liberty
county,
which
has
only
2800
people
in
it,
they
do
not
have
a
compound.
they
interchange
their
facility,
but
if
we
are
going
to
deal
with
the
labels,
i
want
t
straighten
that
much
out
first,
but
we
intend
to
throw
labels
out
the
window,
because
they
really
do
not
mean
anything
at
all.
you
said
so
in
goff
and
that
is
a
fact.
under
the
criminal
justice
act,
it
is
broken
by
congress
that
six-month
on
the
petty
offense
doctrine.
now,
after
the
decision
in
gideon
and
i
think
mr.
justice
stewart
after
several
times
when
you
suggested
that
perhaps
the
matter
of
misdemeanor
ought
to
be
treated
and
had
not
been,
the
supreme
court
of
florida
decided
in
fisher
versus
state
that
if
you
had
meant
the
gideon
should
apply
across
the
board
as
to
crimes
which
includes
both
misdemeanors
and
felonies
that
you
would
assess
them.
and
therefore,
they
held
that
the
counsel
was
not
an
organic
right
in
misdemeanor
situations,
no
matter
what.
now,
on
another
occasion
before
you,
i
advice
you
that
indeed
there
were
some
misdemeanors
in
florida,
though
there
have
been
no
prosecutions
under
it
and
that
carry
the
maximum
penalty,
would
you
believe
of
8
years.
and,
in
which
case
i
think
by
an
inquiry
from
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
replied
that
if
you
had
a
situation
like
that,
it
would
be
absurd
to
suggest
that
you
do
not
appoint
counsel
for
him,
because
of
the
terms
of
confinement.
now,
as
of
january
1,
1972,
all
that
will
be
wiped
out
by
the
passage
of
71-136,
which
is
a
general
reviser’s
bill
and
that
is
found
in
the
florida
session
law
service,
it
is
post
binder,
covered
in
pages
381
to
711
or
some
380
odd
pages
of
a
general
revision
of
the
criminal
code
of
florida.
they
breakdown
felonies
into
four
degrees;
capital
and
three
degrees
of
felonies.
they
break
misdemeanors
down
to
two
degrees
and
misdemeanors
are
broken
down
very
simple.
in
terms
of
time
and
or
money
fines,
for
a
misdemeanor
of
the
first
degree,
by
a
definite
term
of
imprisonment
in
the
county
jail
not
exceeding
one
year.
we
understand
that
under
the
decisions
of
the
fifth
circuit,
in
harvey
in
the
others
and
indeed
under
judge
mert's
decision
in
princeton
(ph),
where
he
breaks
it
in
six
months,
based
upon
the
criminal
justice
act
and
expecting
a
similar
treatment
as
to
federal
and
state
prisoners
that
certainly
everybody
in
florida,
as
of
january
1,
who
is
under
a
misdemeanor
of
the
first
degree,
is
going
to
get
in
counseled,
as
a
matter
of
course.
now,
for
a
misdemeanor
of
a
second
degree,
by
a
definite
term
of
imprisonment
in
the
county
jail,
not
exceeding
60
days.
now,
there
is
also
a
fine
provision,
which
sets
the
fine
at
$500,
but
obviously
after
you
reach
the
decision
that
you
did
not
take,
that
is
meaningless.
since,
if
he
is
indigent
and
cannot
pay
the
fine,
he
cannot
be
made
to
serve
more
than
60
days,
no
matter
how
you
could.
so,
we
are
now
in
the
posture
of
going
down
30
days
below
what
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
has
said
was
very
acceptable
petty
offense
line.
if
it
was
all
misdemeanors
before,
if
it
was
reduced
to
6
months
by
the
criminal
justice
act
and
by
the
state
of
florida
supreme
court
in
argersinger
and
even
if
the
federal
district
court
in
jacksonville
under
willie
(ph),
and
by
the
way
the
only
reason
they
are
not
advising
everybody
as
to
everything,
is
they
are
awaiting
the
outcome
of
your
decision
here
in
this
case
today.
now,
we
say
that
breaking
point
with
the
fifth
circuit
was
set
at
90
days.
we
set
it
ourselves
by
the
florida
supreme
court
relying
on
judge
mert's
decision
in
princeton
at
six
months
which
coincides
with
what
you
said,
in
baldwin
as
to
juries
and
with
the
criminal
justice
act
as
to
petty
offenses.
now,
the
question
becomes,
is
it
awesome
to
the
man
who
faces
some
kind
of
imprisonment
no
matter
what?
well,
somewhere
you
must
break
the
line.
there
was
no
command
at
the
time
that
argersinger
was
argued
there,
except
that
is
urged
here.
now,
i
do
not
know
how
far
we
can
break
it.
all
i
do
know
is
as
of
january
1,
they
are
only
going
to
be
a
handful
of
people
who
are
ever
processed
on
misdemeanor
charges
who
would
not
based
upon
the
imprisonment
possible
be
provided
counsel.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that
is
right.
now,
if
you
recall
under
waller
(ph),
of
course
metropolitan
community
and/or
cities
or
whatever
you
may
call
them
exist
at
the
sovereign
of
the
legislature.
no
laws
that
they
adopt
are
criminal
in
nature.
they
may
adopt
whatever
they
like
either
by
individual
or
charter
provisions
or
they
may
adopt
the
violations
of
the
state
law
as
city
ordinances,
but
they
must
set
independent
punishment
and
in
other
words,
the
reviser’s
bill
does
not
reach
them
any
degree.
i
tell
you,
as
a
matter
of
pure
fact,
although
it
is
not
in
the
record
here,
that
no
city
has
violations
to
my
knowledge,
that
had
ever
come
to
my
attention
that
exceed
90
days
for
a
violation
of
what
would
be
of
criminal
law
had
it
been
processed
in
the
state
or
by
the
county.
so,
in
the
last
analysis,
we
are
told
that
you
allow
people
to
come
into
court
with
the
lawyer
in
situations
of
their
own
hiring,
so
why
should
you
not
do
it
here,
no
matter
what
the
penalty
is,
and
if
you
would
do
and
if
we
use
this,
the
statistics
that
they
given
us
on
the
new
york
report
of
the
million
one
--
million
800
thousand
with
only
40
processed
to
the
degree
where
they
were
put
in
confinement.
if
anything
ever
sounded
like
de
minimis
to
me,
that
certainly
does.
now,
if
it
is
the
awesome
prospect
that
they
tell
us
that
it
is,
how
come
so
few
ever
wound
up
in
jail
as
a
result
of
it?
now,
i
think
mr.
justice
marshall’s
question
about
what
do
you
do
when
somebody
winds
up
on
the
short
end
of
a
theretofore
vacant
threat?
well
obviously,
the
answer
as
you
pose
mr.
justice
stewart
is
if
you
wind
up
with
a
situation
like
that,
that
is
easily
correctable.
we
grant
them
a
new
trial,
if
what
happened
to
him,
so
far
outstrip
what
anybody
expected
certainly
they
are
going
to
grant
him
a
new
trial,
there
is
not
any
question
about
it.
now,
i
do
not
know
how
often
that
is
going
to
occur
if
it
all.
they
are
now,
under
--
in
the
legislature,
in
a
special
session
this
very
day,
and
they
will
meet
in
general
session
in
february
to
take
up
of
all
the
things,
another
reviser’s
bill,
which
it
is
hoped
will
do
a
way
with
most,
if
not
all
of
the
victimless
crimes.
now,
that
would
not
do
away
with
the
dwis
or
anything
like
that,
assuming
anybody
is
injured
or
there
is
a
substantial
amount
of
property
damage.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
driving
while
intoxicated
or
under
the
influence.
now,
many
of
the
minor
violations,
such
as
drunkenness,
loitering
and
i
do
not
know
what
all
are
will
--
if
this
goes
through
be
wiped
out.
now,
what
that
will
do
statistically
to
the
problem
posed,
as
suggested
by
petitioners,
i
do
not
know.
but
if
we
do
away
with
victimless
crimes,
we
are
going
to
do
away
for
the
most
part
with
what
was
the
object
of
your
concern
in
tate
and
other
cases,
similar
to
it.
i
submit
that
it
is
not
anywhere
near
the
problem
suggested.
i
submit
that
the
congress
did
not
think
that
it
was.
i
submit
that
not
even
the
fifth
circuit
thinks
that
it
should
be
extended
below
the
90-day
breaking
line
that
they
adopted.
but
even
if
it
is,
florida
has
broken
in
at
60
days,
as
of
january
1,
1972
and
for
all
the
world,
nothing
i
have
heard
here
today,
gives
me
any
reason
to
suspect
that
what
was
done
with
regard
in
mr.
argersinger
in
the
florida
supreme
court
should
in
be
modified
by
any
decision
that
you
render
here
today.
i
know
that
somebody
says
by
one
day,
he
lost
the
benefit
of
counsel,
but
wherever
you
would
draw
the
line,
assuming
it
is
not
all
the
way
down
to
the
basement,
somebody
is
going
to
lose
by
one
day.
presumably,
if
you
set
the
limit
at
58
days,
surely
an
artful
legislature
would
say,
well,
let
us
make
it
57,
and
it
would
be
a
never
ending
battle.
so,
i
do
not
know
that
one
day
makes
the
difference.
i
know
that
the
doctrine
of
petty
offense
has
to
mean
something.
certainly,
the
congress
was
not
stupid
when
they
adopted
it
nor
was
the
fifth
circuit
stupid
when
they
said
that
we
think
90
days,
is
a
good
place
at
which
to
break
it.
i
think
judge
mert's
was
aptly
justified
in
breaking
it
at
the
six
months
suggested
by
the
criminal
justice
act
of
1964.
since,
it
does
coincide
and
since
that
is
what
the
florida
supreme
court
relied
on
and
there
is
really
no
predicate
for
deciding
that
there
ought
to
be
a
departure
below
the
six-month
petty
offense
rule
and
in
the
last
analysis
since
florida
is
not
going
to
be
imposing
these
awesome
burdens
at
any
time
after
january
1,
i
think
the
action
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
should
be
affirmative
in
this
case.
thank
you.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
i
do
not
know
that
an
individual
stands
in
any
different
posture
with
it
before
a
us
magistrate
than
he
does
when
he
is
before
a
county
judge
of
the
state
or
for
that
matter
of
that
wherever
he
may
be,
where
a
confinement
is
going
to
run
no
more
than
6
months.
if
it
satisfactory
for
an
individual
before
us
magistrate,
i
should
imagine
that
it
is
meaningless
to
an
individual
anywhere
else
to
tell
him
do
not
worry
about
the
rope
burning,
it
is
made
out
of
linen,
instead
of
a
hem.
that
is
just
another
reason,
i
think,
mr.
justice
stewart
why
to
make
a
false
distinction
simply
because
it
has
its
genesis
in
the
state
proceeding
would
be
untoward.
there
is
no
reason
to
tell
an
individual
being
processed
in
a
criminal
system
that
it
is
different
in
one
area
and
he
is
entitled
to
counsel
there
then
it
is
in
another
where
he
is
not
simply
by
rules
adopted
either
by
this
court
or
by
the
congress.
i
think
the
posture
is
the
same.
a
jail
cell
is
a
jail
cell
is
a
jail
cell.
now,
i
do
not
stand
ready,
willing
or
able
to
tell
that
an
individual
ought
to
like
it
for
one
day.
i
am
sure
none
of
them
do,
but
if
we
are
going
to
live
in
a
world
with
people
who
serve
it
and
if
they
are
going
to
be
enough
of
them
to
go
around,
then
i
think
an
intelligent
break
is
made
up
of
six-month
petty
offense
situation
and
hopefully
by
the
time
they
are
finished
you
will
agree
with
that
and
affirm
the
action
below.
i
hope
that
answers
your
question
sir?
thank
you.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
do
think
i'll
need
it.
if
i
cannot
make
it
in
the
time
allotted
i
guess
i
would
better
give
it
up
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
us
to
remember
what
happen
here
before.
the
court
had
cast
upon
it
the
question
of
whether
you
should
consider
this
matter
in
light
of
the
sixth
amendment.
now
they
have
abandoned
that
and
we
have
come
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
let
me
assume
for
the
moment
that
if
i
can
get
to
that,
and
demonstrate
to
you
why
the
sixth
amendment
doesn't
cover
the
situation
will
be
left
with
the
fourteenth
and
then
hopefully
i
can
dissect
it
as
the
solicitor's
office
has
done,
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
setting
out
the
reasons
why
you
should
adopt
it
as
the
predicate
for
the
action
sought
here.
now
as
to
the
sixth
amendment,
mr.
rogow
has
told
you
that
the
reason
that
you
needn't
separate
the
two
is
because
after
all
you
have
said
that
a
jury
trial
is
really
not
quite
as
necessary
to
a
fair
trial
as
is
a
lawyer
and
yet
we
find
that
you
can
waive
both
rights
and
we
hear
from
the
solicitor’s
office
that
what
you
really
ought
to
have
to
save
this
people
if
you
find
that
by
(inaudible)
the
horribles
you
are
going
to
have
horrendous
situation
is
to
get
a
non
lawyers
but
para
legals
or
preachers
or
social
workers
or
somebody
like
that.
now
you
either
going
to
give
them
lawyers
or
you
are
not
going
to
give
them
lawyers.
now
i
understand
that
deans
and
formers
deans
are
very
proud
of
law
students
and
i
understand
that
sometimes
judges
are,
working
lawyers
for
the
states
know
that
the
greatest
number
of
complaints
about
inefficient
counsel
come
in
those
areas.
our
complaints
in
not
regard
and
we
handle
them
all
in
our
office
for
the
state
of
florida
have
increased
1400%.
since
there
has
been
that
kind
of
supervisory
service
rendered
by
supervised
law
students.
now
what
an
appellate
court
does
with
them
is
meaningless.
i
am
telling
you
about
the
complaints
that
come.
now
they
come
with
the
lawyers
just
as
well
as
they
do
without.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
in
light
of
the
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
you
have
to
compare
it
in
terms
of
the
competent
lawyer
i
am
sure.
what
are
the
basis
do
we
have
sir?
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
or
to
the
man
who
winds
in
jail
as
as
the
result
of
bad
service,
i
do
not
guess
it
makes
any
different
what
you
get.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
i
am
satisfied.
i
do
not
need
split
here.
what
i
am
saying
is
if
we
make
it
turn
on
the
awesome
spectrum
if
having
to
go
to
jail
for
even
one
day,
it
is
meaningless
to
tell
me
that
an
isolated
area
where
actually
no
real
harm
is
going
to
be
done
to
the
individual
because
he
batted
somebody
around
what
you
really
need
to
give
this
somebody
less
than
a
lawyer
because
after
all
he
is
only
going
to
get
three
to
four
days,
that
is
meaningless
to
him.
if
you
are
asked
to
believe
the
other
part,
now
if
we
are
going
to
believe
one
part
then
we
ought
to
take
it
all
and
none
at
all.
if
it's
so
awesome
a
prospect
that
it
did
not
keep
you
from
deciding
that
in
your
practice
before
a
magistrates
you
ought
to
break
it
off
at
six
months
then
i
submit
you
ought
to
give
him
counsel
or
tried
and
through
in
the
past
of
our
somewhere
and
allowed
and
able
to
practice.
then
if
they
complain,
we
will
have
to
measure
them
as
against
all
other
lawyers
in
the
general
community.
but
if
we
go
to
the
fourteenth,
how
do
we
carve
about
property
and
what
do
we
do
with
it.
when
foreclose
against
somebody
who
now
loses
the
house,
his
kids
have
got
nowhere
to
stay,
nowhere
to
go,
we
will
give
him
counsel
under
due
process.
on
the
fines,
what
do
we
do
about
the
fines,
what
we
will
do
with
tate.
you
cannot
fine
an
indigent
and
then
if
he
does
not
pay
it
stick
him
in
jail
for
not
pay
it.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no
i
understand
that,
but
to
say
that
we
say
that
the
reason
you
ought
to
give
them
lawyers
is
because
imprisonment
is
the
prospect,
relies
what
you
said
in
tate,
that
is
to
say
you
cannot
fine
a
man
who
is
indigent
and
then
because
he
cannot
pay
it,
stick
him
in
jail
as
penalty
therefore.
now
that
is
here
and
it's
already
been
ruled
on.
now,
if
you
cannot
put
him
in
jail
for
non
payment
of
the
fine
and
if
you
cannot
fine
him
because
you
know
he
cannot
pay
it,
then
truly
you
have
got
a
super
class.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
six
months
in
his
case.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no
but
the
argument,
no
i
understand,
but
the
argument
advanced
here
today
by
both
parties,
by
counsel
for
the
party
and
by
amicus
is
that
you
break
it
at
a
fine.
the
only
time
the
problem
ever
comes
up
is
when
you
have
the
imprisonment
as
the
prospect.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that
is
right.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
all
lines
are
arbitrary.
somebody
drop
(voice
overlap)
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no
not
in
my
mind.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
i
mean
i
do
not
think
you
draw
a
line
about
liberty,
liberty
if
it's
curtailed,
it's
curtailed,
no
quarrel
about
that.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that
is
right.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
just
it
says
life
and
liberty
and
property.
now,
if
you
are
going
to
give
him
counsel
in
one,
you
got
to
give
it
to
him
in
all
unless
you
can
take
a
sharpest
scalp
they
seem
to
use
and
carve
it
out
and
say
why
you
get
it
one
and
not
in
the
other.
now,
i
submit
that
confinement
for
one
day
for
a
man
who
commits
a
running
violation
in
a
vehicle
is
far
less
meaningful
in
terms
of
harm
to
him
or
far
less
meaningful
than
is
the
loss
of
one's
house
on
a
foreclosure
when
he
cannot
gather
up
money
together
so
have
a
lawyer
around
and
get
him
to
come
in
and
do
something
about
if
he
can.
that
is
an
awesome
prospect
to
him,
but
they
say
well
we
do
not
care
about
money
fines
and
we
do
not
care
about
this.
all
we
care
about
is
slamming
a
door
on
him
for
one
day
or
perhaps
for
an
hour
for
all
we
know.
so
i
do
not
how
they
managed
to
cut
it
out.
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
oh
no
i
would
hope
you
can,
certainly.
you
can
waive
jury,
you
can
waive
everything,
you
waive
speedy
trial.
now
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
dade
county
was
mentioned
when
the
figure
of
400,000
was
used.
the
last
time
we
argued
this
case
i
told
you
that
in
terms
of
what
it
would
mean
to
florida,
we
have
dropped
down
to
well
60%
below
what
would
be
the
rule
if
we
adopted
as
the
basis
for
your
future
decision,
what
you
did
in
adopting
the
rules
for
your
practice
before
magistrates.
we
are
down
to
60
days
on
our
split
misdemeanors
if
you
recall.
now
on
the
march
14,
in
florida
along
with
the
number
of
people
who
think
they
are
going
to
find
out
who
is
going
to
be
the
presidential
nominee
for
either
the
democrats
or
republican,
we
wrote
on
article
5
which
is
re-vamping
of
the
court
structure
in
the
state
of
florida.
one
of
the
provisions
that
will
be
voted
on
is
the
total
abolition
of
all
municipal
courts
in
the
state.
you
do
not
have
long
to
wait
once
you
get
to
the
fourteenth,
one
day
beyond
that
the
canvassing
board
will
certify
the
results
we
won't
even
have
any
municipal
courts.
so
remembering
what
it
was
down
to
60
days
in
florida
by
our
legislature
we
are
down
even
below
what
was
done
in
willy
in
the
jacksonville
district
court.
we
are
certainly
down
below
what
was
done
in
mcdonald
and
harvey
and
we
are
certainly
down
below
what
would
be
the
basis
if
we
use
your
procedure
before
magistrates.
we
get
away
with
municipal
courts
and
we
are
down
to
what?
we
are
down
to
county
courts
which
will
be
the
second
strata
of
what
we
get
if
article
5
is
adopted,
now
i
am
sure
that
it
will
be,
but
who
knows
what
the
voters
will
do.
but
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
that's
so.
what
do
we
do
now
about
speedy
trials.
400,000
in
dade
county,
that's
only
in
metro,
that
does
not
take
into
a
count
the
23
cities
which
if
this
article
does
not
pass
will
still
function.
so
we
are
talking
about
better
than
600,000,
but
in
the
rural
communities,
we
do
not
have
to
go
to
north
dakota.
brisco
is
the
county
seat
of
liberty
county,
florida,
there
are
2800
people
in
the
whole
county.
there
has
not
been
a
lawyer
there
for
over
30
years.
now,
i'll
admit
that
they
have
a
circuit
court
that
sits
occasionally
when
they
have
litigation,
but
as
to
those
individuals
who
violate
the
ordinances
of
the
city
there
is
no
one
to
whom
they
can
go
and
there
is
no
one
in
the
court
to
whom
they
can
turn
for
an
appointment
because
there
is
nobody
around.
there
simply
aren't
any
lawyers
and
there
is
no
reason
from
them
to
be
there.
what
do
we
do
for
them?
do
we
say
well
now
you
are
going
to
have
to
wait
until
the
circuit
court
gets
here,
so
that
he
can
appoint
somebody
to
represent
you
and
represent
you
where
in
the
municipal
court,
in
the
county
court,
how
long
will
it
be
before
you
get
to
hearing.
it
got
so
bad
in
liberty
county
that
governor
collins
many
years
ago
had
to
order
them
to
hold
the
term
of
court
because
they
solved
their
business
without
even
going
to
court.
they
decided
who
would
do
what,
and
nobody
seem
any
worse
for
it.
i
do
not
have
the
case
that
is
a
good
notion.
all
i
am
telling
you
that
these
are
things
that
do
occur.
after
the
dickey
decision,
the
florida
supreme
court
decided
to
adopt
a
rule
regarding
speedy
trials
which
they
did.
they
broke
it
into
the
180
days
cold
or
on
demand
60
days.
i
got
so
bad
in
dade
county
which
is
the
source
of
the
400,000
figure
mr.
rogow
gave
you,
that
the
state
attorney's
office
had
to
make
a
special
plea
to
the
florida
supreme
court
to
extend
the
deadline
on
it
because
otherwise
690
man
would
get
a
walk
out
because
they
could
not
meet
the
deadline
which
they
did
by
the
way.
so
piecemeal
they
had
to
make
an
adjustment.
how
much
time
do
you
give
a
man
for
a
speedy
trial
who
faces
the
prospect
of
three
days,
five
days,
ten
days,
i
do
not
know.
you
certainly
cannot
make
it
much
longer
than
the
time
he
would
spend
in
jail
if
he
ever
got
there,
where
it'd
be
meaningless
to
him,
and
if
you
do
mean
to
make
a
speedy
situation
where
do
you
get
the
help.
the
court
reporters
--
you
give
the
man
a
lawyer
free
and
i
guarantee
you
that
he'll
not
only
take
it,
but
he'll
demand
an
appeal
if
he
losses
and
a
lawyer
to
handle
an
appeal
or
a
trial
de
novo,
no
matter
which,
you
do
not
have
to
have
a
court
report.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
oh!
certainly.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
all
felonies
with
the
exception
of
capital
and
just
recently
those
punishable
by
life
imprisonment
have
always
been
bailable
as
a
matter
of
right,
but
that
did
not
stop
the
speedy
trial
demand.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that
is
possibly
so
but
it
is
only
because
of
the
amount
of
the
bail.
in
my
heavenly
days
we
are
from
the
a
severe
state
of
in
terms
of
bail.
you
wind
up
with
anything
over
$7500
bail
then
it
is
a
miracle.
it
just
does
not
happen
because
they
are
not
a
attuned
to
high
bail
in
florida.
now
i
think
--
there
are
host
of
problems,
no
one
of
rich
can
be
answered.
now,
the
solicitor
comes
before
you
and
talks
in
terms
of
a
150,000
cases.
that
maybe
and
it
maybe
that
for
the
federal
system
it
would
be
virtually
a
piece
of
cake,
but
in
terms
of
just
those
half
a
handful
of
states,
you
have
been
told
the
figure
is
12
that
leaves
38
of
12
is
accurate
but
i
think
mr.
rogow
will
have
to
tell
you
that
of
those
12
it
is
tough,
well,
if
there
is
even
one
that
says
if
an
individual
faces
the
possible
prospect
of
one
day's
confinement
we
will
provide
him
free
counsel,
if
he
is
indigent,
i'll
bet
he'll
tell
you
no.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
do
not
think
even
in
minnesota.
now
it
is
just
a
guess
i
would
not
want
to
be
hung
by
it
but
it
occurs
to
me
that
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
if
we
are
talking
about
38
states,
let
assume
the
12
is
the
correct
figure,
if
we
are
talking
to
about
38
states
i
submit
they
ought
to
have
a
better
spokesman
than
me
concerning
my
history
before
this
court.
now
and
they
want
to
rely
on
the
solicitor
but
they
ought
to
have
a
better
spokesman
than
me
and
they
ought
to
be
give
an
opportunity
to
come
to
you
and
tell
you
what
it
is
they
have
in
terms
of
a
peculiar
problem
and
many
in
prison
that
made
about
statistics
that
would
support
this
better
than
other.
and
it
does
seem
to
me
that
it
is
not
an
easy
question
no
matter
which
course
you
follow.
but
certainly
if
it
did
not
disturb
you
in
grafting
the
procedure
to
be
followed
before
magistrates
to
break
the
line
at
six
months
on
the
petty
offense
and
if
the
brenson
decision
relying
on
that,
another
position
is
accurate.
if
a
jury
break
down
is
accurate
at
this
then
it
occurs
to
me
that
if
our
own
fifth
circuit
and
if
our
own
federal
district
court
by
the
way
breaks
it
in
90
days
and
if
we
have
broke
in
at
60
then
we
will
probably
reduce
it
even
further
then
it
seems
to
me
that
we
are
all
talking
about
something
that
really
is
far
less
in
terms
of
a
horrible
prospect
then
we
made
it
out
to
be.
now
talking
about
the
aba;
it
is
a
very
compelling
organization
and
much
of
what
they
have
done
has
proved
to
be
some
law
in
the
future.
mr.
chief
justice
you
may
not
remember
out
of
jackson
hole,
wyoming,
when
we
were
out
there
with
the
ten
circuit
sometime
ago
shortly
after
you
took
your
chair,
but
the
minimum
standards
committee
serving
florida
has
just
submitted
it
is
a
matter
to
the
florida
bar
for
inclusion
in
the
journal
and
it
will
be
presented
to
the
florida
supreme
court.
no
where
does
it
include
anything
about
providing
counsel
for
indigents
at
this
level,
no
where.
i
served
on
that
committee
as
its
vice-chairman.
now
it
maybe
that
somebody
will
initiate
something
like
that
in
florida
and
remember
i
am
speaking
for
florida,
not
for
any
of
the
other
38
or
magically
the
12
that
make
up
the
total
of
50,
but
i
will
tell
you
that
if
it
is
a
recommendation,
it
still
has
not
reached
florida
as
well.
now
somebody
else
may
put
it
out
in
that
fashion,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
if
we
are
going
to
provide
people
with
lawyers,
it
better
be
lawyers
and
not
ministers
or
anything
like
that.
if
we
are
going
to
provide
lawyers
which
we
are
assured
will
be
here
in
the
next
12
or
13
years,
may
would
go
to
eight
12
or
13
years
to
find
out
not
only
if
they
are
there,
but
if
the
problem
that
is
posed
is
really
the
problem
that
is
urged
and
if
there
is
such
problem,
whether
it
can
be
solve
in
a
fashion
that
we
can
even
accommodate,
we
do
not
have
the
physical
room
for
this
people.
we
are
told
that
we
have
created
the
defenders
system
right
after
gideon,
that
is
true.
we
had
seven
days
after
your
decisions
state
wide.
we
were
the
first
ones
to
respond
in
that
fashion
and
fittingly
since
gideon
came
from
florida,
you
are
told
now
that
the
defenders
can
pick
up
ten
times
as
many
misdemeanor
prosecutions
and
handle
them
with
relative
ease.
now
is
that
because
those
cases
are
ten
times
easier
or
because
they
will
give
them
only
one
tenth
of
the
time
necessary.
if
they
are
all
as
horrible
as
they
say,
nobody
sitting
in
this
room
today
ought
to
be
able
to
convince
you
that
they
only
work
one
tenth
of
a
time,
simply
because
the
sentence
involved
maybe
minimum.
to
the
individual
going
to
jail,
as
i
said
before
in
response
to
your
question,
i
cannot
break
the
line
at
liberty
and
it
is
meaningful
to
him
if
he
decides
that
he
has
been
done
in
by
law
enforcement,
if
somebody
been
try
to
do
him
in
and
he
wants
representation
and
if
he
is
innocent
by
golly
anytime
he
spends
in
jail
is
terrible
to
him.
and
to
somebody
who
can
say
well
now
look,
the
felony
is
important
you
know
of
being,
either
they
caught
him
coming
out
of
the
window,
this
is
going
to
take
a
day
and
a
half,
i'll
have
to
pick
to
jury.
truth
to
the
matter
is
we
assured
there
aren't
going
to
be
any
jury,
do
not
you
believe
that.
we
wind
up
without
any
municipal
courts
and
they
are
tried
in
a
county
court,
you
are
going
to
see
jury
trials
and
you
are
going
to
see
them
in
alarming
frequency.
there
is
no
question
about
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact
right
now
in
florida
on
traffic
violations
in
municipal
courts
you
have
an
option
at
which
you
can
request
a
trial
in
a
county
court
with
a
jury.
now
that
is
an
exercise
too
often
because
it
involves
money
and
lawyers
but
the
moment
they
find
that
they
can
have
they
are
going
to
exercise
it
just
as
rapidly
and
quickly
as
they
can.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
if
they
can
have
it
oh
sure.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
oh
sure.
i
am
certain
of
it.[laughter]
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
if
we
arrived
that
the
jury
trial
at
six
months
or
greater
that
should
be
the
same
predicate
for
the
counsel
(voice
overlap)
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
no
i
don't
--
no,
your
honor
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
it
will
ultimately
find
its
way
to
you
and
you
are
going
to
have
to
slap
us
down,
because
we
do
not
give
them
that
is
not
what
i
mean.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that
is
correct.
all
i
am
saying
is
that
we
will
be
confronted
with
the
problem
and
since
i
say
i
do
only
speak
for
florida
then
it
recurs
to
us.
for
more
then
several
reasons,
not
only
those
that
i
have
advanced
here.
but
it
does
seem
to
me
that
there
is
been
less
of
the
reason
advanced
here
on
this
occasion,
more
people
talking,
saying
more
things,
but
not
as
much
reason
as
was
advanced
the
first
time
and
accordingly
whatever
you
do
as
to
mr.
argensinger
certainly
if
he
is
re-tried
he
will
be
given
counsel,
but
that
is
under
own
statute
right
now
and
under
our
own
florida
supreme
rule
in
this
very
case.
so
that
if
he
were
retried
he
had
his
lawyer.
it
isn't
the
question
what
happens
to
argensinger,
it
is
a
question
what
happens
to
all
the
others
that
are
sure
to
follow
and
i
might
add
he
could
have
had
the
new
trial
because
there
was
an
admitted
boykin
violation
in
the
processing
of
his
own
case
which
was
stipulated
to
by
the
state
in
the
florida
supreme
court
and
we
said
so
in
our
brief.
so
it
isn't
a
problem
of
whether
he
gets
his
review,
that
is
not
really
what
they
have,
so
much
it
is
the
overall
quest.
thank
you.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
of
course,
you
mean
on
the
boykin
violation
no
question
about
that,
i
would
be
delighted.
i
would
like
to
somebody
else
have
a
chance
to
extend
gideon
doctrine
rather
than
florida.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
not
at
all.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
they
what?
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
do
not
quite
that
mean.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
would
rather
not
avoid
it
and
yet
i
do
not
really
know
how
to
answer
it
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well
no
i
quite
understand
but
would
you
believe
that
the
day
after
the
opinion
came
out
why
they
descended
on
our
office
and
wanted
to
know
what
it
was
we
could
do
to
draft
on
that
would
be
found
acceptable
and
so
far
i
told
them
i
have
to
go
to
washington
and
i
could
not
spend
anytime
on
it
i
hope
somebody
else
could
but
hopefully
--thank
you.
