mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
certiorari
was
granted
in
this
case
to
review
the
decision
of
the
florida
supreme
court
which
held
four
to
three
that
the
right
to
counsel
extends
only
to
those
cases
which
carry
a
maximum
punishment
in
excess
of
six
months.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
john
richard
argersinger
who
is
convicted
in
the
leon
county
court,
in
tallahassee,
florida
on
a
charge
of
carrying
a
concealed
weapon.
the
maximum
punishment
imposable
on
that
charge
was
six
months
imprisonment
or
a
fine
of
$1,000.00.
because
the
maximum
punishment
imposable
was
only
six
months,
the
florida
supreme
court
held
that
argersinger
was
not
entitled
to
have
been
advised
of
his
right
to
counsel.
three
dissenters
in
the
florida
supreme
court
would
have
held
that
the
right
to
counsel
extends
to
any
offense
in
which
a
man
may
loose
his
liberty.
our
position
is
essentially
that.
our
position
is
that
wherever
the
actual
threat
of
incarceration
exists,
a
man
must
be
advised
of
his
right
to
counsel
and
counsel
must
be
appointed
for
him,
if
he
cannot
afford
afford
counsel,
unless
the
defendant
knowingly
and
intelligently
waives
that
right.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
if
went
ahead
with
the
trial
and
not
imposed
incarceration
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes
sir.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
our
position
is
that
he
would
have
to
be
offered
a
new
trial
with
a
benefit
of
counsel
then
no
double
jeopardy
problem
would
be
raised
because
this
would
be
in
effect
an
appeal,
a
voluntary
act
by
the
defendant
in
accepting
a
new
trial.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
think
that
he
could
waive
counsel,
even
at
that
point,
only
if
he
was
clearly
advised
of
the
consequences
of
his
act.
he
was
clearly
advised
that
this
judges
considering
putting
him
in
jail
or
he
was
going
to
put
him
in
jail.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
well,
i
do
not
think
that
he
would
really
have
that
option.
i
think
that
he
has
the
option
to
waive
the
right
to
counsel
that
point
if
the
court
has
explained
to
him
the
circumstances
that
exist,
the
real
threat
that
he
may
go
to
jail.
i
do
think
he
can
in
effect
have
his
cake
and
eat
it
too
and
say
now
you
tried
me,
now
i
am
going
to
take
this
trial
because
i
know
you
cannot
incarcerate
me.
i
think
that
he
has
to
make
a
decision
between
one
or
the
other.
i
think
if
he
failed
to
make
that
decision,
and
if
he
stood
on
that
first
trial,
i
do
think
the
decision
will
be
able
to
be
reviewed.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
if
he
had
been
advised
at
the
outset
that
there
was
an
actual
threat
of
incarceration
and
that
he
may
very
well
go
to
jail
and
he
had
a
right
to
counsel,
then
counsel
be
appointed
and
he
waives
his
right
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
in
that
very
instance
i
think
the
judge
might
be
left
with
the
fact
that
he
will
not
be
able
to
impose
incarceration.
if
there
has
been
a
clear
situation
originally
where
the
man
did
request
counsel
and
the
judge
had
made
up
his
mind
there
would
be
no
imprisonment,
i
think
that
is
a
rare
case
though.
i
think
that
what
happens
in
most
of
these
cases
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
rare,
your
honor
because
i
think
that
in
very
few
of
these
relatively
minor
offenses
and
i
mean,
very
minor
offenses,
for
instance
violations
in
the
city
of
new
york
which
carry
a
maximum
penalty
of
15
days,
very
can
people
actually
go
to
jail
in
those
cases.
a
statistic
contained
in
our
brief
at
page
40
shows
that
over
million
eight
hundred
thousand
people
were
tried
in
new
york
on
these
minor
violations
and
only
40
were
actually
incarcerated.
so
i
think
there
really
is
some
practical
recognition
made
everyday
in
every
court
in
the
country
that
some
offenses,
although
they
carry
the
possibility
because
the
ordinance
says
15
days,
there
is
no
real
actual
possibility
have
incarceration.
our
position
is
essentially
drawn
from
the
long
line
of
cases
beginning
with
powell
versus
alabama
through
johnson
versus
zerbst,
gideon
versus
wainright,
in
re
gault,
and
coleman
versus
alabama.
in
this
long
line
of
cases
the
court
has
consistently
held
that
the
right
to
counsel
is
fundamental.
it
is
essential
to
the
fact
finding
process
and
a
fair
trial
cannot
be
held
without
the
guiding
hand
of
counsel
of
every
point.
as
the
court
said
in
gideon
in
our
advisory
system
of
criminal
justice,
any
person
held
into
court
who
is
too
poor
to
higher
lawyer
cannot
be
assured
a
fair
trial,
unless
counsel
was
provided
for
him.
we
submit
that
those
words
in
gideon
are
equally
applicable
to
a
case
where
man
may
lose
his
liberty
for
even
one
day.
several
courts
had
held
that
there
is
no
distinction
to
be
drawn
by
the
constitution
between
loss
of
liberty
for
a
long
period
of
time
and
loss
of
liberty
for
a
short
period.
nearly
30
years
ago,
in
evans
versus
reeves,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
said
just
that.
the
constitution
draws
as
no
distinction
between
loss
of
liberty
for
a
long
time
and
short
time.
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
has
held
in
every
case
that
has
come
before
it
that
the
right
to
counsel
extended
to
the
indigent
misdemeanant
or
traffic
violator
who
has
faced
with
as
in
each
case
there
was
presented
in
the
fifth
circuit,
90
days,
that
in
each
of
those
cases
the
right
to
counsel
extended.
there
is
no
real
hard
and
fast
rule
though
in
the
fifth
circuit
because
the
fifth
circuit
decisions
have
been
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
in
one
case
james
versus
headley,
judge
wisdom
writing
for
himself
alone,
urged
the
position
that
we
urge
here
today
that
anytime
there
is
an
actual
threat
of
incarceration,
a
person
should
be
provided
a
counsel.
that
position
is
supported
by
the
aba
committee
on
minimum
standards
for
criminal
justice
which
urges
a
very
similar
position
almost
exactly
like
ours.
the
president's
commission
on
crime
and
law
enforcement
has
urged
a
similar
position.
so
the
position
that
we
submit
to
the
court
today
is
not
one
that
is
not
been
recognized
even
judicially
or
by
established
committees
of
the
bar.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
he
need
that
be
advise
of
his
right
to
counsel.
of
course,
he
still
can
bring
counsel,
if
he
could
afford
counsel.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
exactly
you
honor.
there
is
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
if
the
judge
does
not
impose
a
jail
sentence,
there
is
no
actual
threat
of
the
jail
sentence
then
under
the
theory
we
advance,
there
would
be
no
need
to
point
out
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
understand.
the
difficulty
is
it
has
to
be
sort
of
a
pre-judgment
and
this
court
is
acknowledge
that
kind
of
judgment
in
the
criminal
content
cases
dealing
with
right
to
a
jury
trial
where
if
a
decision
is
made
by
the
presiding
judge
that
this
defendant
may
get
more
than
six
months,
there
has
to
be
jury
trial
provided.
there
are
faults
in
this
position.
i
would
prefer
i
think
a
flat
out
rule
that
anytime
a
person
faces
even
a
remotest
possibility
of
incarceration
he
should
be
provided
counsel,
but
the
rule
we
advance
and
the
rule
that
it
is
supported
by
the
solicitor
general
takes
into
consideration
the
practical
aspects
of
what
goes
on
everyday
in
a
low
visibility
of
the
criminal
justice
system
and
that
is
at
many
minor
offenders
sidewalks
splitters,
jay
walkers
these
are
always
a
kind
of
offenses
that
raised
in
the
decisions
which
seek
to
limit
the
right
to
counsel.
those
people
do
not
actually
face
the
threat
of
incarceration.
of
course,
under
the
ordinance
they
may,
but
it
is
such
a
remote
possibility,
we
submit
that
the
real
threat
of
incarceration
does
not
exist.
only
10
states
still
adhere
to
a
firm
and
inflexible
rule
that
the
right
to
counsel
extends
only
to
felonies.
the
other
states
have
all
moved
beyond
the
gideon
versus
wainright
decision
in
one
form
or
another.
not
all
of
them
do
what
minnesota
as
done
in
state
versus
borst
and
say
that
if
imprisonment
is
likely
to
be
imposed
then
the
court
must
appoint
counsel.
several
other
states
have
adapted
the
same
position
not
always
on
constitutional
grounds.
the
minnesota
decision
was
based
upon
the
rule
making
power
of
that
court.
new
jersey
in
rodriguez
versus
rosenblatt
arrived
at
the
same
conclusion
based
upon
its
own
laws,
but
what
is
important
to
looking
at
the
states
is
that
they
have
moved
into
the
field
of
providing
counsel
for
misdemeanors
and
there
is
no
great
fear
on
the
part
of
the
states,
that
providing
such
counsel
would
cause
them
any
great
harm.
the
arguments
that
had
been
advanced
in
limiting
the
right
to
counsel
to
an
access
of
six
month
cases
are
based
upon
one
or
several
of
the
following
theories.
first
that
because
the
right
to
counsel
and
the
right
to
jury
trial
both
reside
in
the
sixth
amendment,
the
right
to
counsel
must
be
governed
by
this
court's
decision
in
a
jury
trial
case,
baldwin
versus
new
york.
we
submit
that,
that
argument
is
just
not
valid.
there
is
a
great
difference
between
counsel
and
a
jury
trial.
as
the
court
recognized
in
baldwin
a
fair
trial
can
be
had
without
a
jury
and
in
fact
everyday
in
this
country
fair
trials
are
had
without
a
jury
by
a
judge
alone,
but
a
lawyer
is
essential
to
the
fact
finding
process
and
the
lawyer
must
be
there
to
hammer
out
the
facts
which
the
decider
will
have
to
consider.
therefore,
analogy
between
jury
trial
and
counsel
is
not
valid
and
one
other
reason,
i
think
this
court
is
recognized
that
the
analogy
is
invalid
in
holding
the
right
to
counsel
retroactive,
but
in
refusing
to
hold
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
retroactive.
another
argument
advanced
in
the
cases
which
seek
to
limit
the
right
to
counsel
is
that
because
the
right
to
counsel
in
jury
trial
both
reside
in
the
sixth
amendment,
baldwin
versus
new
york
must
govern,
but
there
are
other
rights
in
the
sixth
amendment.
there
is
a
right
to
a
public
trial,
the
right
to
a
speedy
trial,
the
right
to
confront
the
witnesses
against
you,
the
right
to
compulsory
process.
no
court
has
ever
held
to
my
knowledge
that
those
rights
are
contingent
upon
a
sentence
which
exceeds
six
months.
so
any
argument
that
because
all
these
right
reside
in
the
same
amendment,
they
are
govern
by
baldwin
versus
new
york,
just
does
not
hold.
another
argument
advanced
by
people
seeking
to
limit
the
right
to
counsel
is
that
the
criminal
justice
at
title
18
us
code,
section
3068
at
present
which
is
the
federal
standard
for
appointed
counsel,
limits
appointed
counsel
only
to
cases
which
exceeds
six
months,
but
that
law
relates
only
to
the
payment
of
counsel.
it
does
not
set
a
firm
rule
that
counsel
shall
not
be
provided
in
so
called
petty
offenses.
in
fact
to
the
contrary,
the
framers
of
the
law,
the
legislative
history
compel
the
--
support
the
conclusion
that
they
believed
that
the
right
to
counsel
did
extend
to
petty
offenses
and
they
left
the
criminal
justice
act
open
ended.
so
the
counsel
will
be
able
to
be
paid,
if
this
court
holds
that
the
right
to
counsel
does
extend
beyond
or
into
--
in
cases
that
hold
--
that
carry
less
than
six
month
penalty.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
as
i
read
it,
it
is
very
identical
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
if
a
matter
of
semantics
i
think
becomes
involved,
yes
sir.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
not
all
together,
your
honor.
there
are
points
in
the
government
submission
that
i
would
not
agree
with
in
every
facet,
but
in
terms
of
this
rule
itself
we
do
agree
there
is
no
disagreement.
the
government
has
excluded
a
great
many
the
other
cases
which
we
think
may
--
do
not
need
to
be
decided
today,
but
may
in
the
future
be
presented,
but
for
the
purpose
of
this
case
there
is
no
disagreement
between
the
government
and
ourselves.
another
argument
raised
by
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes
there
are
--
has
to
be
advise
of
counsel
before
acceptance
of
a
plea.
the
plea
is
a
crucial
time.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
am
sorry.
if
there
is
only
going
to
be
fine
there
would
be
no
need
to
advise
on
his
right
to
counsel.
but
what
we
are
here
asking
is
a
judicial
recognition
of
the
practical
procedures
that
take
place
everyday.
we
are
saying
there
are
millions
of
cases
tried
in
this
country,
first
offense
speeding,
things
like
where
no
one
goes
to
jail,
although
the
ordinance
says
perhaps
a
ten-day
penalty
could
be
imposed,
but
no
one
does
go
to
jail,
we
are
saying
that
the
judiciary
does
in
fact
everyday
make
these
determinations.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
the
figures
on
that
are
not
rely
--
does
not
exist.
the
only
statistics
that
i
have
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
the
statistics
that
i
have
for
instance
in
new
york
where
of
the
hundred
thousand
persons
for
traffic
violations,
only
40
actually
went
to
jail.
i
can
really
speak
only
in
terms
of
some
practical
experience
in
dade
county.
about
400,000
people
are
faced
with
traffic
offenses
in
cases
tried
in
the
metro
court,
but
only
about
5,000
those
people
ever
actually
faced
incarceration.
so
in
that
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
well
those
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
incarcerated.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes
sir,
incarcerate.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
per
year.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes
sir.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
exactly.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
well
exactly
in
fact
our
position
is
that
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
those
are
in
the
six-month
cases
and
the
maximum
penalty
imposable
in
dade
county
is
only
sixty
days,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no
sir
for
up
to
sixty
days
only.
the
maximum
penalty
imposable
in
dave
county
metropolitan
court
is
60
days
or
a
$500
fine.
the
offenses
include
everything
from
the
loitering
and
vagrancy
to
drunk
driving.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
5,000
people.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
in
dade
county.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes
i
would
say
a
lot
of
them
are
but
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
the
estimates
are
about
25%
of
the
total
so
called
misdemeanants,
these
kind
of
offenses
are
indigent.
but
excepting
your
figures
of
25%,
1250
or
2500
appointments
would
have
to
be
made
but
the
statistics
also
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes
there
was
not
a
valid
waiver
but
the
statistics
also
show
that
a
public
defender
who
can
handle
a
150
felonies
a
year,
can
handle
a
thousand
of
these
cases
a
year
because
these
cases
are
not
as
complex.
these
cases,
of
course
there
will
be
no
jury
trial
in
these
cases
either.
the
case
will
proceed
much
more
rapidly.
so
if
we
are
talking
about
a
public
defender
being
able
to
handle
a
thousand
cases
then
we
were
talking
about
2500
cases.
we
are
talking
only
about
two
and
a
half
public
defenders.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
your
honor
but
in
may
change
in
two
ways.
it
may
result
in
guilty
pleas
where
there
would
not
be
a
guilty
plea
without
counsel.
in
other
words,
if
a
defendant
confirms
with
counsel
and
learns
exactly
what
the
nature
the
offense
is
and
what
his
defenses
are
and
it
maybe
he
has
no
defense.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
your
honor,
i
am
afraid
the
only
places
where
any
statistics
at
all
exist
are
in
the
national
legal
aid
and
defenders
associate
amicus
brief
which
was
filed
in
this
court
and
55
iowa
law
review
and
in
13
wilman
maryland
law
review
there
are
some
attempt
to
me
to
provide
statistics.
wilman
maryland
article
echoes
really
the
national
legal
aid
defenders
association
brief.
the
statistics
are
sketchy.
in
fact,
only
this
morning
i
was
in
contact
with
the
national
legal
aid
defenders
association
in
effort
to
get
some
additional
statistics,
which
they
said
were
not
available.
they
have
recently
received
the
grant
for
a
$100,000
to
find
out
exactly
how
much
you
spent
in
the
country.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
for
all
offenses
which
might
result
in
the
loss
of
liberty,
except
the
minor
traffic
where
there
is
no
real
threat
of
incarceration.
my
statistics
show
12.
minnesota,
these
are
the
states
in
which
except
for
the
rare
--
these
are
the
states
which
provide
counsel
in
all
cases
in
which
there
is
no
possibility
except
those
one
no
possibility
in
which
incarceration
will
be
imposed.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
12.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
12
provide
counsel.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
not
provision
under
the
ordinance,
no
sir.
those
--
those
things
provide
counsel
in
accordance
with
the
rule
we
advocate
today.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes
sir.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
minnesota
is
one
of
them,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
they
are
enlisted
in
our
brief.
there
is
a
compilation
of
states.
there
are
some
recent
decisions.
for
instance,
alaska
only
two
months
ago,
anchorage
versus
city
of
alaska
arrived
at
the
same
conclusion,
wherever
there
is
a
possibility
of
incarceration,
counsel
be
provided.
the
reason
that
there
is
not
a
great
problem,
a
great
economic
problem
involved
here
because
as
we
argued
before,
most
of
these
public
defendant
situations
and
systems
already
do
provide
some
counsel
in
misdemeanor
cases
and
more
than
that
when
gideon
was
decided,
it
caused
a
creation
of
public
defender
system
nationwide.
what
we
are
seeking
here
will
not
cause
such
a
creation.
what
it
will
do
perhaps
will
be
to
enlarge
the
already
existing
public
defender
system,
but
gideon
required
a
whole
new
creation,
this
does
not.
this
builds
only
upon
the
prior
of
decisions
of
the
court.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
in
those
cases,
for
instance
mississippi
comes
to
mind,
where
they
have
rural
areas,
they
a
circuit
court
which
travels
and
at
a
certain
time
during
the
year
that
circuit
court
sits
and
there
are
defense
counsel
available.
we
would
submit
that
in
that
kind
of
situation
when
the
trial
court
which
tries
felonies
comes
town.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no
sir
and
that
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
in
terms
of
circuit
courts
that
move,
i
think
there
are
several
rural
states
which
do
have
that
where
there
is
not
enough
court
business
to
maintain
a
sitting
of
court
through
out
the
year.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes
sir,
but
even
in
those
cases
the
defendant
must
move
to
the
court
in
a
felony
case
and
there
must
be
counsel
provided.
all
we
are
saying
that
will
be
necessary
would
be
for
this
misdemeanor
to
move
to
that
same
court.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
in
a
municipal
court
of
sometime.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
if
there
is
no
counsel
available
is
that
the
court's
question?
the
only
thing
that
we
suggest
that
can
be
done
would
be
to
have
sometime
legislation
passed
in
that
kind
of
a
state
where
the
trial
court
of
criminal
cases,
the
felony
cases
would
have
jurisdiction
to
try
that
case.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
well,
obviously
there
will
be
a
significant
impact,
but
the
people
that
have
refused
to
extend
the
right
to
counsel
have
raised
the
spectrum
of
counsel
for
walk
splitters
and
jay
walkers
and
they
have
exaggerated
the
--
the
need
for
counsel
because
they
do
not
taking
into
consideration
the
practical
day
to
day
situation
in
these
courts.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
not
necessarily.
it
might
require
that
the
penalty
imposed
by
the
justice
court
would
have
to
be
less
than
incarceration,
but
it
would
not
necessarily
do
away
with
the
jurisdiction
of
the
justice
court
in
anyway.
because
i
am
not
aware
of
how
many
people
actually
face
incarceration
in
those
cases
and
if
they
are
relatively
few,
they
may
try
minor
offenses
which
they
do
not
actually
carry
the
threat
of
incarceration.
if
that
is
the
case
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes
there
is
a
problem,
your
honor.
there
is
no
doubt
this
is
not
going
to
be
something
it
will
this
to
be
taking
overnight,
implemented
without
any
discomfort
at
all
to
the
states,
but
recently
in
mayer
versus
city
of
chicago
this
court
is
held
that
when
a
fundamental
right
is
involved,
the
expense
is
not
something
to
be
considered
in
terms
of
guaranteeing
a
fundamental
right.
we
are
not
saying
there
will
be
no
expense
here.
we
are
not
saying
there
will
be
no
changes,
there
obviously
will
be.
we
are
saying
these
changes
are
no
where
as
great
as
some
people
would
have
us
believe.
one
of
the
other
argument
that
is
raised
in
our
position
to
any
attempt
to
extend
the
right
to
counsel
is
the
rules
for
the
trial
of
minor
offenses
before
a
magistrate.
our
position
on
that
is
that
those
rules
in
rule
3,
allow
trial
in
the
district
court
and
rule
44
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
provides
that
counsel
in
a
district
court
should
be
appointed,
even
the
trial
of
petty
offenses.
therefore,
there
is
a
right
to
counsel
still
in
those
cases.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
believe
the
solicitor
general's
brief
used
the
figure
of
150,000
and
200,000,
i
am
not
sure
exactly,
but
in
his
brief
his
submission
is
that
the
federal
system
could
incorporate
the
rule
that
we
advocate
without
any
great
difficulty.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes
for
the
magistrates,
i
am
sorry.
an
equal
protection
argument
exists
also
in
this
case
and
that
is
that
what
we
have
here
is
a
classification
made
by
the
state
of
florida
denying
counsel
to
some
and
guaranteeing
counsel
to
others.
we
submit
that
the
equal
protection
clause
would
equally
guarantee
counsel
in
this
case
and
that,
that
and
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
would
apply.
i
would
like
to
reserve
five
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
there
really
is
not
much
disagreement
between
my
brother
mr.
georgieff
and
myself.
as
he
said
in
his
argument
there
is
no
real
horrible
prospect
here.
he
mentioned
several
matters
that
he
thought
might
cause
problems.
in
fact,
in
his
brief
on
page
17
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
florida
is
suggesting
a
betts
versus
brady
rule
they
are
not
the
same
in
anyway,
that
is
should
be
no
right
to
counsel
in
these
misdemeanor
offenses.
they
have
suggested
betts
versus
brady
on
page
17
and
we
submit
that
betts
versus
brady
was
rejected
in
gideon
versus
wainright.
one
problem
that
does
concern
me
in
this
case
and
that
is
in
seeking
to
assure
that
a
decision
be
reached
which
will
limit
the
future
litigation
in
terms
of
on
a
case
by
case
basis
trying
to
decide
whether
there
was
a
violation
or
whether
there
wasn't.
i
think
that
the
waiver
of
counsel
must
be
set
forth
clearly
in
any
decision
this
court
reaches,
set
forth
in
such
a
way
so
that
it
is
clear
that
the
trial
court
will
advise
the
defendant
not
just
it
has
a
right
to
counsel,
right
to
appoint
a
counsel
but
advise
the
defendant
that
trial
judge
has
concluded
that
there
is
a
real
actual
threat
of
incarceration
and
only
in
that
kind
of
situation
could
defend
and
make
a
knowing
and
intelligent
waiver
on
the
johnson
versus
zerbst
as
of
his
right
to
counsel.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes
sir
exactly.
it
would
be
reverse
discrimination
i
think
if
he
did
not.
i
think
it
would
have
to
be
clear.
our
position
is
if
the
supreme
court
of
florida
should
be
reversed
the
case
should
be
reminded
argersinger
and
all
of
the
persons
who
face
actual
threat
of
incarceration
should
be
advised
and
provided
counsel
unless
they
knowingly
and
intelligently
waive
that
right,
waive
it
knowingly
and
intelligently
waived
that
right.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
certiorari
was
granted
in
this
case
to
review
the
decision
of
the
florida
supreme
court
which
held
four
to
three
that
the
right
to
counsel
extends
only
to
those
cases
which
carry
a
maximum
punishment
in
excess
of
six
months.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
john
richard
argersinger
who
is
convicted
in
the
leon
county
court,
in
tallahassee,
florida
on
a
charge
of
carrying
a
concealed
weapon.
the
maximum
punishment
imposable
on
that
charge
was
six
months
imprisonment
or
a
fine
of
$1,000.00.
because
the
maximum
punishment
imposable
was
only
six
months,
the
florida
supreme
court
held
that
argersinger
was
not
entitled
to
have
been
advised
of
his
right
to
counsel.
three
dissenters
in
the
florida
supreme
court
would
have
held
that
the
right
to
counsel
extends
to
any
offense
in
which
a
man
may
loose
his
liberty.
our
position
is
essentially
that.
our
position
is
that
wherever
the
actual
threat
of
incarceration
exists,
a
man
must
be
advised
of
his
right
to
counsel
and
counsel
must
be
appointed
for
him,
if
he
cannot
afford
afford
counsel,
unless
the
defendant
knowingly
and
intelligently
waives
that
right.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
if
went
ahead
with
the
trial
and
not
imposed
incarceration
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes
sir.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
our
position
is
that
he
would
have
to
be
offered
a
new
trial
with
a
benefit
of
counsel
then
no
double
jeopardy
problem
would
be
raised
because
this
would
be
in
effect
an
appeal,
a
voluntary
act
by
the
defendant
in
accepting
a
new
trial.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
think
that
he
could
waive
counsel,
even
at
that
point,
only
if
he
was
clearly
advised
of
the
consequences
of
his
act.
he
was
clearly
advised
that
this
judges
considering
putting
him
in
jail
or
he
was
going
to
put
him
in
jail.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
well,
i
do
not
think
that
he
would
really
have
that
option.
i
think
that
he
has
the
option
to
waive
the
right
to
counsel
that
point
if
the
court
has
explained
to
him
the
circumstances
that
exist,
the
real
threat
that
he
may
go
to
jail.
i
do
think
he
can
in
effect
have
his
cake
and
eat
it
too
and
say
now
you
tried
me,
now
i
am
going
to
take
this
trial
because
i
know
you
cannot
incarcerate
me.
i
think
that
he
has
to
make
a
decision
between
one
or
the
other.
i
think
if
he
failed
to
make
that
decision,
and
if
he
stood
on
that
first
trial,
i
do
think
the
decision
will
be
able
to
be
reviewed.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
if
he
had
been
advised
at
the
outset
that
there
was
an
actual
threat
of
incarceration
and
that
he
may
very
well
go
to
jail
and
he
had
a
right
to
counsel,
then
counsel
be
appointed
and
he
waives
his
right
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
in
that
very
instance
i
think
the
judge
might
be
left
with
the
fact
that
he
will
not
be
able
to
impose
incarceration.
if
there
has
been
a
clear
situation
originally
where
the
man
did
request
counsel
and
the
judge
had
made
up
his
mind
there
would
be
no
imprisonment,
i
think
that
is
a
rare
case
though.
i
think
that
what
happens
in
most
of
these
cases
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
rare,
your
honor
because
i
think
that
in
very
few
of
these
relatively
minor
offenses
and
i
mean,
very
minor
offenses,
for
instance
violations
in
the
city
of
new
york
which
carry
a
maximum
penalty
of
15
days,
very
can
people
actually
go
to
jail
in
those
cases.
a
statistic
contained
in
our
brief
at
page
40
shows
that
over
million
eight
hundred
thousand
people
were
tried
in
new
york
on
these
minor
violations
and
only
40
were
actually
incarcerated.
so
i
think
there
really
is
some
practical
recognition
made
everyday
in
every
court
in
the
country
that
some
offenses,
although
they
carry
the
possibility
because
the
ordinance
says
15
days,
there
is
no
real
actual
possibility
have
incarceration.
our
position
is
essentially
drawn
from
the
long
line
of
cases
beginning
with
powell
versus
alabama
through
johnson
versus
zerbst,
gideon
versus
wainright,
in
re
gault,
and
coleman
versus
alabama.
in
this
long
line
of
cases
the
court
has
consistently
held
that
the
right
to
counsel
is
fundamental.
it
is
essential
to
the
fact
finding
process
and
a
fair
trial
cannot
be
held
without
the
guiding
hand
of
counsel
of
every
point.
as
the
court
said
in
gideon
in
our
advisory
system
of
criminal
justice,
any
person
held
into
court
who
is
too
poor
to
higher
lawyer
cannot
be
assured
a
fair
trial,
unless
counsel
was
provided
for
him.
we
submit
that
those
words
in
gideon
are
equally
applicable
to
a
case
where
man
may
lose
his
liberty
for
even
one
day.
several
courts
had
held
that
there
is
no
distinction
to
be
drawn
by
the
constitution
between
loss
of
liberty
for
a
long
period
of
time
and
loss
of
liberty
for
a
short
period.
nearly
30
years
ago,
in
evans
versus
reeves,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
said
just
that.
the
constitution
draws
as
no
distinction
between
loss
of
liberty
for
a
long
time
and
short
time.
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
has
held
in
every
case
that
has
come
before
it
that
the
right
to
counsel
extended
to
the
indigent
misdemeanant
or
traffic
violator
who
has
faced
with
as
in
each
case
there
was
presented
in
the
fifth
circuit,
90
days,
that
in
each
of
those
cases
the
right
to
counsel
extended.
there
is
no
real
hard
and
fast
rule
though
in
the
fifth
circuit
because
the
fifth
circuit
decisions
have
been
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
in
one
case
james
versus
headley,
judge
wisdom
writing
for
himself
alone,
urged
the
position
that
we
urge
here
today
that
anytime
there
is
an
actual
threat
of
incarceration,
a
person
should
be
provided
a
counsel.
that
position
is
supported
by
the
aba
committee
on
minimum
standards
for
criminal
justice
which
urges
a
very
similar
position
almost
exactly
like
ours.
the
president's
commission
on
crime
and
law
enforcement
has
urged
a
similar
position.
so
the
position
that
we
submit
to
the
court
today
is
not
one
that
is
not
been
recognized
even
judicially
or
by
established
committees
of
the
bar.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
he
need
that
be
advise
of
his
right
to
counsel.
of
course,
he
still
can
bring
counsel,
if
he
could
afford
counsel.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
exactly
you
honor.
there
is
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
if
the
judge
does
not
impose
a
jail
sentence,
there
is
no
actual
threat
of
the
jail
sentence
then
under
the
theory
we
advance,
there
would
be
no
need
to
point
out
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
understand.
the
difficulty
is
it
has
to
be
sort
of
a
pre-judgment
and
this
court
is
acknowledge
that
kind
of
judgment
in
the
criminal
content
cases
dealing
with
right
to
a
jury
trial
where
if
a
decision
is
made
by
the
presiding
judge
that
this
defendant
may
get
more
than
six
months,
there
has
to
be
jury
trial
provided.
there
are
faults
in
this
position.
i
would
prefer
i
think
a
flat
out
rule
that
anytime
a
person
faces
even
a
remotest
possibility
of
incarceration
he
should
be
provided
counsel,
but
the
rule
we
advance
and
the
rule
that
it
is
supported
by
the
solicitor
general
takes
into
consideration
the
practical
aspects
of
what
goes
on
everyday
in
a
low
visibility
of
the
criminal
justice
system
and
that
is
at
many
minor
offenders
sidewalks
splitters,
jay
walkers
these
are
always
a
kind
of
offenses
that
raised
in
the
decisions
which
seek
to
limit
the
right
to
counsel.
those
people
do
not
actually
face
the
threat
of
incarceration.
of
course,
under
the
ordinance
they
may,
but
it
is
such
a
remote
possibility,
we
submit
that
the
real
threat
of
incarceration
does
not
exist.
only
10
states
still
adhere
to
a
firm
and
inflexible
rule
that
the
right
to
counsel
extends
only
to
felonies.
the
other
states
have
all
moved
beyond
the
gideon
versus
wainright
decision
in
one
form
or
another.
not
all
of
them
do
what
minnesota
as
done
in
state
versus
borst
and
say
that
if
imprisonment
is
likely
to
be
imposed
then
the
court
must
appoint
counsel.
several
other
states
have
adapted
the
same
position
not
always
on
constitutional
grounds.
the
minnesota
decision
was
based
upon
the
rule
making
power
of
that
court.
new
jersey
in
rodriguez
versus
rosenblatt
arrived
at
the
same
conclusion
based
upon
its
own
laws,
but
what
is
important
to
looking
at
the
states
is
that
they
have
moved
into
the
field
of
providing
counsel
for
misdemeanors
and
there
is
no
great
fear
on
the
part
of
the
states,
that
providing
such
counsel
would
cause
them
any
great
harm.
the
arguments
that
had
been
advanced
in
limiting
the
right
to
counsel
to
an
access
of
six
month
cases
are
based
upon
one
or
several
of
the
following
theories.
first
that
because
the
right
to
counsel
and
the
right
to
jury
trial
both
reside
in
the
sixth
amendment,
the
right
to
counsel
must
be
governed
by
this
court's
decision
in
a
jury
trial
case,
baldwin
versus
new
york.
we
submit
that,
that
argument
is
just
not
valid.
there
is
a
great
difference
between
counsel
and
a
jury
trial.
as
the
court
recognized
in
baldwin
a
fair
trial
can
be
had
without
a
jury
and
in
fact
everyday
in
this
country
fair
trials
are
had
without
a
jury
by
a
judge
alone,
but
a
lawyer
is
essential
to
the
fact
finding
process
and
the
lawyer
must
be
there
to
hammer
out
the
facts
which
the
decider
will
have
to
consider.
therefore,
analogy
between
jury
trial
and
counsel
is
not
valid
and
one
other
reason,
i
think
this
court
is
recognized
that
the
analogy
is
invalid
in
holding
the
right
to
counsel
retroactive,
but
in
refusing
to
hold
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
retroactive.
another
argument
advanced
in
the
cases
which
seek
to
limit
the
right
to
counsel
is
that
because
the
right
to
counsel
in
jury
trial
both
reside
in
the
sixth
amendment,
baldwin
versus
new
york
must
govern,
but
there
are
other
rights
in
the
sixth
amendment.
there
is
a
right
to
a
public
trial,
the
right
to
a
speedy
trial,
the
right
to
confront
the
witnesses
against
you,
the
right
to
compulsory
process.
no
court
has
ever
held
to
my
knowledge
that
those
rights
are
contingent
upon
a
sentence
which
exceeds
six
months.
so
any
argument
that
because
all
these
right
reside
in
the
same
amendment,
they
are
govern
by
baldwin
versus
new
york,
just
does
not
hold.
another
argument
advanced
by
people
seeking
to
limit
the
right
to
counsel
is
that
the
criminal
justice
at
title
18
us
code,
section
3068
at
present
which
is
the
federal
standard
for
appointed
counsel,
limits
appointed
counsel
only
to
cases
which
exceeds
six
months,
but
that
law
relates
only
to
the
payment
of
counsel.
it
does
not
set
a
firm
rule
that
counsel
shall
not
be
provided
in
so
called
petty
offenses.
in
fact
to
the
contrary,
the
framers
of
the
law,
the
legislative
history
compel
the
--
support
the
conclusion
that
they
believed
that
the
right
to
counsel
did
extend
to
petty
offenses
and
they
left
the
criminal
justice
act
open
ended.
so
the
counsel
will
be
able
to
be
paid,
if
this
court
holds
that
the
right
to
counsel
does
extend
beyond
or
into
--
in
cases
that
hold
--
that
carry
less
than
six
month
penalty.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
as
i
read
it,
it
is
very
identical
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
if
a
matter
of
semantics
i
think
becomes
involved,
yes
sir.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
not
all
together,
your
honor.
there
are
points
in
the
government
submission
that
i
would
not
agree
with
in
every
facet,
but
in
terms
of
this
rule
itself
we
do
agree
there
is
no
disagreement.
the
government
has
excluded
a
great
many
the
other
cases
which
we
think
may
--
do
not
need
to
be
decided
today,
but
may
in
the
future
be
presented,
but
for
the
purpose
of
this
case
there
is
no
disagreement
between
the
government
and
ourselves.
another
argument
raised
by
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes
there
are
--
has
to
be
advise
of
counsel
before
acceptance
of
a
plea.
the
plea
is
a
crucial
time.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
am
sorry.
if
there
is
only
going
to
be
fine
there
would
be
no
need
to
advise
on
his
right
to
counsel.
but
what
we
are
here
asking
is
a
judicial
recognition
of
the
practical
procedures
that
take
place
everyday.
we
are
saying
there
are
millions
of
cases
tried
in
this
country,
first
offense
speeding,
things
like
where
no
one
goes
to
jail,
although
the
ordinance
says
perhaps
a
ten-day
penalty
could
be
imposed,
but
no
one
does
go
to
jail,
we
are
saying
that
the
judiciary
does
in
fact
everyday
make
these
determinations.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
the
figures
on
that
are
not
rely
--
does
not
exist.
the
only
statistics
that
i
have
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
the
statistics
that
i
have
for
instance
in
new
york
where
of
the
hundred
thousand
persons
for
traffic
violations,
only
40
actually
went
to
jail.
i
can
really
speak
only
in
terms
of
some
practical
experience
in
dade
county.
about
400,000
people
are
faced
with
traffic
offenses
in
cases
tried
in
the
metro
court,
but
only
about
5,000
those
people
ever
actually
faced
incarceration.
so
in
that
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
well
those
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
incarcerated.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes
sir,
incarcerate.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
per
year.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes
sir.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
exactly.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
well
exactly
in
fact
our
position
is
that
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
those
are
in
the
six-month
cases
and
the
maximum
penalty
imposable
in
dade
county
is
only
sixty
days,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no
sir
for
up
to
sixty
days
only.
the
maximum
penalty
imposable
in
dave
county
metropolitan
court
is
60
days
or
a
$500
fine.
the
offenses
include
everything
from
the
loitering
and
vagrancy
to
drunk
driving.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
5,000
people.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
in
dade
county.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes
i
would
say
a
lot
of
them
are
but
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
the
estimates
are
about
25%
of
the
total
so
called
misdemeanants,
these
kind
of
offenses
are
indigent.
but
excepting
your
figures
of
25%,
1250
or
2500
appointments
would
have
to
be
made
but
the
statistics
also
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes
there
was
not
a
valid
waiver
but
the
statistics
also
show
that
a
public
defender
who
can
handle
a
150
felonies
a
year,
can
handle
a
thousand
of
these
cases
a
year
because
these
cases
are
not
as
complex.
these
cases,
of
course
there
will
be
no
jury
trial
in
these
cases
either.
the
case
will
proceed
much
more
rapidly.
so
if
we
are
talking
about
a
public
defender
being
able
to
handle
a
thousand
cases
then
we
were
talking
about
2500
cases.
we
are
talking
only
about
two
and
a
half
public
defenders.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
your
honor
but
in
may
change
in
two
ways.
it
may
result
in
guilty
pleas
where
there
would
not
be
a
guilty
plea
without
counsel.
in
other
words,
if
a
defendant
confirms
with
counsel
and
learns
exactly
what
the
nature
the
offense
is
and
what
his
defenses
are
and
it
maybe
he
has
no
defense.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
your
honor,
i
am
afraid
the
only
places
where
any
statistics
at
all
exist
are
in
the
national
legal
aid
and
defenders
associate
amicus
brief
which
was
filed
in
this
court
and
55
iowa
law
review
and
in
13
wilman
maryland
law
review
there
are
some
attempt
to
me
to
provide
statistics.
wilman
maryland
article
echoes
really
the
national
legal
aid
defenders
association
brief.
the
statistics
are
sketchy.
in
fact,
only
this
morning
i
was
in
contact
with
the
national
legal
aid
defenders
association
in
effort
to
get
some
additional
statistics,
which
they
said
were
not
available.
they
have
recently
received
the
grant
for
a
$100,000
to
find
out
exactly
how
much
you
spent
in
the
country.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
for
all
offenses
which
might
result
in
the
loss
of
liberty,
except
the
minor
traffic
where
there
is
no
real
threat
of
incarceration.
my
statistics
show
12.
minnesota,
these
are
the
states
in
which
except
for
the
rare
--
these
are
the
states
which
provide
counsel
in
all
cases
in
which
there
is
no
possibility
except
those
one
no
possibility
in
which
incarceration
will
be
imposed.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
12.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
12
provide
counsel.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
not
provision
under
the
ordinance,
no
sir.
those
--
those
things
provide
counsel
in
accordance
with
the
rule
we
advocate
today.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes
sir.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
minnesota
is
one
of
them,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
they
are
enlisted
in
our
brief.
there
is
a
compilation
of
states.
there
are
some
recent
decisions.
for
instance,
alaska
only
two
months
ago,
anchorage
versus
city
of
alaska
arrived
at
the
same
conclusion,
wherever
there
is
a
possibility
of
incarceration,
counsel
be
provided.
the
reason
that
there
is
not
a
great
problem,
a
great
economic
problem
involved
here
because
as
we
argued
before,
most
of
these
public
defendant
situations
and
systems
already
do
provide
some
counsel
in
misdemeanor
cases
and
more
than
that
when
gideon
was
decided,
it
caused
a
creation
of
public
defender
system
nationwide.
what
we
are
seeking
here
will
not
cause
such
a
creation.
what
it
will
do
perhaps
will
be
to
enlarge
the
already
existing
public
defender
system,
but
gideon
required
a
whole
new
creation,
this
does
not.
this
builds
only
upon
the
prior
of
decisions
of
the
court.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
in
those
cases,
for
instance
mississippi
comes
to
mind,
where
they
have
rural
areas,
they
a
circuit
court
which
travels
and
at
a
certain
time
during
the
year
that
circuit
court
sits
and
there
are
defense
counsel
available.
we
would
submit
that
in
that
kind
of
situation
when
the
trial
court
which
tries
felonies
comes
town.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no
sir
and
that
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
in
terms
of
circuit
courts
that
move,
i
think
there
are
several
rural
states
which
do
have
that
where
there
is
not
enough
court
business
to
maintain
a
sitting
of
court
through
out
the
year.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes
sir,
but
even
in
those
cases
the
defendant
must
move
to
the
court
in
a
felony
case
and
there
must
be
counsel
provided.
all
we
are
saying
that
will
be
necessary
would
be
for
this
misdemeanor
to
move
to
that
same
court.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
in
a
municipal
court
of
sometime.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
if
there
is
no
counsel
available
is
that
the
court's
question?
the
only
thing
that
we
suggest
that
can
be
done
would
be
to
have
sometime
legislation
passed
in
that
kind
of
a
state
where
the
trial
court
of
criminal
cases,
the
felony
cases
would
have
jurisdiction
to
try
that
case.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
well,
obviously
there
will
be
a
significant
impact,
but
the
people
that
have
refused
to
extend
the
right
to
counsel
have
raised
the
spectrum
of
counsel
for
walk
splitters
and
jay
walkers
and
they
have
exaggerated
the
--
the
need
for
counsel
because
they
do
not
taking
into
consideration
the
practical
day
to
day
situation
in
these
courts.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
not
necessarily.
it
might
require
that
the
penalty
imposed
by
the
justice
court
would
have
to
be
less
than
incarceration,
but
it
would
not
necessarily
do
away
with
the
jurisdiction
of
the
justice
court
in
anyway.
because
i
am
not
aware
of
how
many
people
actually
face
incarceration
in
those
cases
and
if
they
are
relatively
few,
they
may
try
minor
offenses
which
they
do
not
actually
carry
the
threat
of
incarceration.
if
that
is
the
case
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes
there
is
a
problem,
your
honor.
there
is
no
doubt
this
is
not
going
to
be
something
it
will
this
to
be
taking
overnight,
implemented
without
any
discomfort
at
all
to
the
states,
but
recently
in
mayer
versus
city
of
chicago
this
court
is
held
that
when
a
fundamental
right
is
involved,
the
expense
is
not
something
to
be
considered
in
terms
of
guaranteeing
a
fundamental
right.
we
are
not
saying
there
will
be
no
expense
here.
we
are
not
saying
there
will
be
no
changes,
there
obviously
will
be.
we
are
saying
these
changes
are
no
where
as
great
as
some
people
would
have
us
believe.
one
of
the
other
argument
that
is
raised
in
our
position
to
any
attempt
to
extend
the
right
to
counsel
is
the
rules
for
the
trial
of
minor
offenses
before
a
magistrate.
our
position
on
that
is
that
those
rules
in
rule
3,
allow
trial
in
the
district
court
and
rule
44
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
provides
that
counsel
in
a
district
court
should
be
appointed,
even
the
trial
of
petty
offenses.
therefore,
there
is
a
right
to
counsel
still
in
those
cases.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
believe
the
solicitor
general's
brief
used
the
figure
of
150,000
and
200,000,
i
am
not
sure
exactly,
but
in
his
brief
his
submission
is
that
the
federal
system
could
incorporate
the
rule
that
we
advocate
without
any
great
difficulty.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes
for
the
magistrates,
i
am
sorry.
an
equal
protection
argument
exists
also
in
this
case
and
that
is
that
what
we
have
here
is
a
classification
made
by
the
state
of
florida
denying
counsel
to
some
and
guaranteeing
counsel
to
others.
we
submit
that
the
equal
protection
clause
would
equally
guarantee
counsel
in
this
case
and
that,
that
and
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
would
apply.
i
would
like
to
reserve
five
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
there
really
is
not
much
disagreement
between
my
brother
mr.
georgieff
and
myself.
as
he
said
in
his
argument
there
is
no
real
horrible
prospect
here.
he
mentioned
several
matters
that
he
thought
might
cause
problems.
in
fact,
in
his
brief
on
page
17
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
florida
is
suggesting
a
betts
versus
brady
rule
they
are
not
the
same
in
anyway,
that
is
should
be
no
right
to
counsel
in
these
misdemeanor
offenses.
they
have
suggested
betts
versus
brady
on
page
17
and
we
submit
that
betts
versus
brady
was
rejected
in
gideon
versus
wainright.
one
problem
that
does
concern
me
in
this
case
and
that
is
in
seeking
to
assure
that
a
decision
be
reached
which
will
limit
the
future
litigation
in
terms
of
on
a
case
by
case
basis
trying
to
decide
whether
there
was
a
violation
or
whether
there
wasn't.
i
think
that
the
waiver
of
counsel
must
be
set
forth
clearly
in
any
decision
this
court
reaches,
set
forth
in
such
a
way
so
that
it
is
clear
that
the
trial
court
will
advise
the
defendant
not
just
it
has
a
right
to
counsel,
right
to
appoint
a
counsel
but
advise
the
defendant
that
trial
judge
has
concluded
that
there
is
a
real
actual
threat
of
incarceration
and
only
in
that
kind
of
situation
could
defend
and
make
a
knowing
and
intelligent
waiver
on
the
johnson
versus
zerbst
as
of
his
right
to
counsel.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes
sir
exactly.
it
would
be
reverse
discrimination
i
think
if
he
did
not.
i
think
it
would
have
to
be
clear.
our
position
is
if
the
supreme
court
of
florida
should
be
reversed
the
case
should
be
reminded
argersinger
and
all
of
the
persons
who
face
actual
threat
of
incarceration
should
be
advised
and
provided
counsel
unless
they
knowingly
and
intelligently
waive
that
right,
waive
it
knowingly
and
intelligently
waived
that
right.
