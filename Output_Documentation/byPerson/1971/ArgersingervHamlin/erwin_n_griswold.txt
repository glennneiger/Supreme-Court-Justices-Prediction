mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
pleas
the
court.
perhaps
i
am
too
unreconstructed.
what
i
plan
to
do
here
is
to
think
of
the
legal
problem
in
this
case
in
terms
of
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendment,
rather
in
terms
of
the
right
to
counsel
provision
in
the
sixth
amendment.
this
is
a
state
case
and
if
the
sixth
amendment
is
applicable,
it
is
true
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
as
far
as
the
sixth
amendment
alone
is
concerned,
there
are
in
some
minds
at
least,
some
verbal
or
doctrinal
difficulties.
by
its
language,
the
sixth
amendment
guarantee
is
only
the
right
to
have
counsel
and
not
the
right
to
have
counsel
supplied.
i
know
that
the
contrary
was
decided
in
the
gideon
case
and
that
this
was
set
to
rest
on
the
sixth
amendment.
for
some
though
this
has
a
more
understandable
foundation
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
then
there
is
the
fact
that
the
sixth
amendment
by
it
terms
is
applicable
in
all
criminal
prosecutions
and
the
court
has
decided
in
the
duncan
and
baldwin
that
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
also
provided
by
the
sixth
amendment
is
applicable
where
the
penalty
is
more
than
six
months.
on
this
basis,
it
is
contended
as
it
was
decided
below
that
the
right
to
counsel
provision
can
be
applicable
only
where
more
than
six
months
imprisonment
is
involved.
of
course
they
are
authorities
who
are
saying
that
the
same
words
in
a
statute
or
constitution
may
have
different
meanings
and
different
applications.
this
involves
that
some
intellectual
strain,
but
as
i
have
said
it's
easier
for
me
to
deal
with
the
problem
in
terms
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
after
all
it
is
a
case
of
procedural
due
process
which
lies
at
the
heart
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
two,
we
are
more
accustomed
to
think
of
due
process
as
a
developing
idea
then
we
are
define
such
flexibility
in
some
of
the
earlier
amendments.
on
this
basis,
i
look
at
the
gideon
case
which
with
respect
it
seems
to
me
to
have
a
fairly
sound
due
process
foundation
in
considering
the
right
to
counsel.
i
cannot
find
any
basis,
any
logical
ground
to
stand
on
for
saying
that
the
right
to
counsel
exists
for
imprisonment
of
six
months
or
more,
but
does
not
apply
for
imprisonment
for
less
than
six
months.
i
recognize
that
lines
have
to
be
drawn
on
the
law
like
the
age
of
majority
and
that
my
case
is
close
to
the
line
on
each
side
will
not
be
very
different
from
each
others.
however,
with
respect
to
imprisonment
i
find
it
hard
to
draw
a
line
in
any
place.
five
months
imprisonment
seems
to
me
to
be
substantial.
i
do
not
find
much
help
when
the
time
is
reduced
to
ten
days
or
five
days.
there
seems
to
me
to
be
a
difference
in
kind
between
the
imprisonment
of
any
duration
and
merely
monetary
sanctions
or
other
sanctions
which
maybe
imposed
by
judicial
decisions.
these
other
sanctions
maybe
a
serious
burden,
but
they
do
not
keep
involve
depriving
a
person
of
his
liberty
and
that
is
something
fundamental
in
our
society
and
thus
i
have
found
myself
forced
to
the
conclusion
that
there
should
be
a
due
process
right
to
counsel
and
that
this
right
should
be
applicable,
before
any
term
of
imprisonment
can
be
imposed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
any
imprisonment
at
all
is
the
only
place
where
i
can
find
a
satisfactory
place
to
draw
the
line,
drawing
a
distinction
between
imprisonment
and
monetary
penalties
of
one
kind
or
another.
obviously
there
are
problems
at
the
boarder
line,
as
the
case
is
mentioned
by
my
associate
here
where
a
statute
authorizes
imprisonment
but
it
is
rarely
imposed.
i
should
think
that
in
such
cases
the
prosecutor
or
judge
should
make
the
determination
in
advance
or
if
something
develops
at
the
trial
which
makes
imprisonment
seem
appropriate,
and
the
defendant
has
not
had
counsel,
whether
he
had
waived
it
or
not
before
that
without
a
clear
understanding
that
imprisonment
was
a
likely
consequence,
there
should
at
the
defendant's
request
be
a
new
trial
or
a
counsel
will
be
provided
and
very
likely
before
a
different
judge.
if
in
answer
to
chief
justice's
question,
he
says
well
i
stand
on
that
trial,
i
take
it
that
to
be
waiver
of
his
right
to
counsel
but
he
should
have
a
right
to
have
counsel
at
a
new
trial.
if
he
does
not
want
it,
it
should
be
forced
on
him.
this
conclusion
that
counsel
should
be
made
available
for
an
indigent
defendant
before
any
term
of
imprisonment
is
imposed
is
essentially
the
conclusion
which
has
been
reached
by
two
eminent
bodies
which
have
considered
this
problem
not
as
judges,
but
as
persons
vitally
interested
in
developing
proper
standards
for
the
administration
of
criminal
justice.
these
are
the
american
bar
association
and
it
is
minimum
standards
for
criminal
justice
and
the
president's
commission
on
law
enforcement
and
administration
of
justice.
both
are
cited
on
page
17
of
our
brief.
the
bar
association
recommendation
on
this
matter
has
in
substance
been
approved
at
least
three
times
by
the
house
of
delegates
of
the
association
which
is
a
large
and
representative
group
of
the
profession.
because
of
these
reports
and
actions,
i
have
more
confidence
in
the
conclusion
to
which
i
have
felt
myself
compelled
as
an
intellectual
matter,
and
namely
that
counsel
must
be
made
available
to
an
indigent
before
any
sentence
of
imprisonment
can
be
imposed.
i
am
also
confirmed
by
the
excellent
opinion
of
justice
jacobs
of
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
for
an
unanimous
court
in
rodriguez
against
rosenblatt
decided
last
may.
at
this
point
though
another
extremely
difficult
problem
arises.
what
are
the
practical
consequences
of
such
a
conclusion?
what
will
be
required
in
the
way
of
manpower,
can
the
legal
personnel
would
be
made
available.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
i
am
sorry
mr.
justice,
it
is
not
cited
in
our
brief.
it
is
58
new
jersey,
281
and
277
atlantic
second
216.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
although
our
information
about
the
manpower
situation
is
sketchy,
what
we
have
is
encouraging.
as
far
as
the
federal
courts
are
concerned,
a
counsel
is
now
required
in
all
cases
unless
it
is
waived.
that's
rule
44a
of
the
rules
--
federals
rules
of
civil
procedure
and
i
say
the
same
is
applicable
with
respect
to
trials
in
the
magistrate's
courts
because
any
defendant
there
may
elect
to
have
a
trial
in
the
district
court
where
he
can
have
counsel
assigned
to
him
if
he
chooses
in
order
to
save
time
and
to
get
it
over
with
which
i
think
is
often
situation
in
these
new
cases
to
go
ahead
in
the
magistrate's
court,
he
has
had
the
right
to
go
to
the
district
court
and
have
counsel
and
i
find
it
not
too
difficult.
moreover
it
seems
to
me
not
unlikely
that
counsel
can
be
provided
in
the
magistrate's
courts.
the
latest
amendment
of
the
criminal
justice
act
provides
for
compensation
for
counsel
in
these
cases
because
it's
now
been
amended
to
say
wherever
it
is
required
by
the
constitution
and
if
this
court
so
decides,
then
it
will
be
covered.
all
cases
involving
any
imprisonment
have
long
been
covered
in
the
district
of
columbia,
where
there
are
of
course
many
petty
offenses
and
this
is
not
proved
to
be
unbarred.
as
far
as
the
situations
in
the
states
is
concerned
there
is
more
room
for
concern.
however,
the
problems
will
probably
not
be
as
serious
in
actuality
as
the
statistics
on
the
number
of
cases
would
indicate.
in
the
first
place
it
appears
that
merely
half
of
the
states
now
cover
all
or
nearly
all
of
these
cases
and
to
that
extent,
to
the
extent
that
increases
in
services
are
required,
there
all
figures
need
to
be
adjusted
because
it
undoubtedly
is
true
that
it
takes
less
time
to
try
most
misdemeanors
than
it
does
the
more
serious
cases.
moreover,
it
is
likely
that
the
counsel
will
be
waived
more
often
in
cases
of
petty
offenses.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
waivers
might
well
be
more
readily
accepted
in
cases
of
this
sort
and
where
the
charge
is
a
bit
of
serious
felony.
if
the
defendant
in
response
to
inquiry
from
the
court
says
he
does
not
want
counsel,
it
should
not
be
forced
when
the
right
to
counsel
and
usefulness
of
counsel
are
somewhat
attenuated
as
they
are
here.
we
have
considerable
light
on
all
of
these
questions
in
the
two
briefs
of
amicus
curie
which
have
been
filed
in
this
case
on
behalf
of
the
legal
age
society
of
new
york
which
sets
out
actual
experience
in
a
situation
where
counsel
are
required
in
the
cases
of
this
sort
in
our
most
congested
metropolitan
area,
and
the
national
legal
aid
and
defenders
association
and
as
has
been
said
much
the
same
information
is
contained
in
an
article
in
the
recent
issue
of
the
william
and
mary
law
review.
new
york
has
for
sometime
provided
for
representation
in
cases
where
imprisonment
maybe
opposed
--
imposed
and
the
new
york
legal
aid
society
shows
that
the
load
can
be
handled.
so
maybe
other
brief
in
the
article
summarize
experience
in
other
places
which
indicates
that
the
load
though
substantial
is
not
unmanageable.
on
the
basis
of
this
information
and
experience,
i
find
myself
led
to
the
conclusion
that
the
chances
are
that
the
adoption
by
this
court
of
a
rule
that
counsel
must
be
furnished
before
any
imprisonment
maybe
imposed
would
result
in
increasing
the
man
hours
required
of
the
defense
counsel
by
a
50
or
60%.
this
is
a
serious
matter
that
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
insuperable.
i
have
tried
to
put
together
some
figures
but
they
are
much
too
uncertain.
on
the
basis
of
those
figures
i
estimate
that
it
is
perhaps
as
many
as
3,000
additional
lawyers
would
required.
at
$10,000
a
year
that
would
be
a
cost
of
30
million
dollars.
if
you
add
half
of
that
for
secretarial
and
other
personnel,
it
might
get
up
to
as
much
as
50
million
dollars.
whatever
that
financial
load,
this
should
be
manageable
when
allocated
to
the
50
states.
even
though
some
of
the
larger
states
would
have
to
carry
a
considerable
part
of
the
load.
that
california
and
illinois
and
new
york
now
provide
for
counsel
in
these
cases.
thus
a
considerable
part
of
the
additional
load
is
already
undertaken.
other
states
should
now
be
guided
to
do
likewise
just
as
was
the
situation
when
the
gideon
case
itself
was
decided.
in
this
connection
with
respect
to
the
availability
of
lawyers
to
carry
the
task,
i
am
encouraged
by
the
presently
existing
fact
that
there
are
now
twice
as
many
students
in
the
nation's
law
schools
as
they
were
ten
years
ago.
that
young
lawyers
are
starting
their
practice
in
unprecedented
numbers
and
that
it
is
estimated
that
the
number
of
lawyers
in
the
country
will
double
within
the
next
12
or
13
years.
already
concern
is
being
expressed
about
the
openings
which
will
be
available
for
these
new
lawyers.
it
maybe
that
the
recognition
of
the
need
and
the
availability
of
the
means
to
answer
are
about
to
coincide.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
is
not
in
our
brief
mr.
justice.
what
information
there
is,
is
included
in
these
two,
in
the
petitioner's
brief
here
and
in
the
two
briefs
amicus
which
have
been
filed
and
as
far
as
i
know
there
is
no
other
information.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
how
many
states?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
is
--
one
of
the
brief
says
30.
i
said
close
to
half,
counsel
for
the
petitioner
said
10
i
believe.
it
really
boils
down
to
a
question
how
you
define
certain
borderline
matters.
frankly
i
was
not
trying
to
resolve
all
of
those
borderlines
matters.
traffic
offenses,
well
they
vary
all
the
way
from
automobile
man
slaughter
on
the
one
hand
to
failing
to
stop
it
an
intersection
when
there
was
no
other
car
nearby
or
overtime
parking.
the
only
formula
i
have
been
able
to
come
up
here
with
is
before
any
imprisonment
is
in
fact
imposed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
do
not
how
many
mr.
justice.
i
know
that
there
now
a
great
many.
they
used
to
be
only
one
and
i
was
just
quite
instrumental
in
helping
to
bring
that
about,
but
this
is
one
of
the
one
of
the
points
that
i
wanted
bring
out.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
are
great
many
states.
there
has
been
a
movement
in
recent
years
in
that
direction.
i
am
concerned
about
the
quality
of
the
service
that
will
be
performed
by
practicing
members
of
the
bar.
it
can
be
rather
stultifying
to
be
assigned
to
go
to
courtroom
14
and
represent
a
100
people
this
morning.
even
that
might
be
better
than
no
representation,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
what
we
to
do
is
setup
the
standard
and
then
rely
on
local
courts,
bar
association,
legal
aid
agencies
and
so
on,
to
try
and
find
ways
to
see
that
the
representation
is
appropriately
provided
and
consistently
to
the
efficiency
of
the
courts.
this
also
was
a
matter
of
legitimate
concern.
the
introduction
of
counsel
in
the
more
cases
will
require
more
pre-trials
time
of
prosecutors
and
more
courtroom
time
and
this
will
lead
the
bigger
backlogs
with
present
personnel.
court
reporters
will
be
needed
as
well
as
counsel
and
that's
one
of
our
worst
bottlenecks.
it
seems
equally
clear
that
we
need
more
courtroom
personnel
and
the
only
way
we
would
get
it
is
by
building
up
the
pressure
which
will
make
it
clear
that
such
personnel
must
be
provided.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
this
court
has
more
less
intimated
as
much
in
the
some
cases.
it
is
rather
difficult
to
carry
out
an
appeal
without
a
transcript
and
i
would
suspect
as
practical
matter
that
it
would
be
found
the
court
reporters
were
necessary
where
counsel
were
provided.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
but
i
think
it
to
serious
problem
that
not
only
this
cases
but
in
all
criminal
cases
that
we
ought
to
find
ways
to
improve
perhaps
by
putting
court
reporters
on
salaries
rather
than
having
them
paid
by
piece
work
because
we
now
do.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
states
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
federal
courts
are
very
much
in
that
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
suspect
the
state
courts
have
more
trouble
than
the
federal
courts
do
on
this.
i
am
not
really
familiar
with
nationwide
with
the
state
court
situation
with
the
respect
to
the
reporters.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
whatever
it
was
mr.
justice,
it
would
of
course
there
would
be
no
need
for
a
reporter.
i
have
a
final
word.
if
this
step
is
taken
i
have
the
feeling
that
it
should
be
expressly
made
none
retroactive.
presumably
that's
not
very
important,
since
relatively
short
sentences
are
involved.
however,
i
would
go
even
further
and
respectfully
suggest
that
the
court's
decision
should
expressly
provide
that
it
would
not
become
fully
effective
for
some
period
in
the
future,
say
for
year
or
until
january
1,
1974.
this
will
give
the
states
an
opportunity
to
adjust
to
the
new
requirement.
without
something
like
this
if
for
example
even
without
retroactivity
this
court's
decision
should
become
fully
applicable
on
the
day
it
is
announced,
there
could
be
a
massive
pile
up
in
the
state
courts
which
do
not
now
meet
the
standard.
this
would
involve
delays
and
frustrations
which
would
not
be
a
real
contribution
to
the
administration
of
justice.
i
recognize
that
such
a
provision,
may
i
have
a
three
minutes
more
mr.
chief
justice,
thank
you.
i
recognize
that
such
a
provision
with
the
unusual,
but
it
would
not
be
unlike
the
powers
exercised
by
courts
of
equity
in
abetting
the
nuisance
for
example
which
allow
time
to
the
parties
to
take
the
step
which
are
necessary
to
effectuate
the
court's
decision.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
do
know
mr.
justice.
i
think
that
this
is
a
--
this
is
getting
out
to
a
place
where
things
are
very
attenuated
and
i
find
it
easier
to
accept
that
recognition
of
not
fully
complying
with
what
the
court
now
regards
the
constitutional
requirement
to
be
than
it
is
to
say
we
must
comply
and
everything
is
in
chaos.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
certainly
that
has
been
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice
i
am
(voice
overlap)
simply
speaking
your
(inaudible).
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
sir,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
with
respect
to
the
constitution
that
does
not,
does
not
shock
me.
with
respect
the
constitutional
requirements,
i
would
have
put
it
that
way
myself.
i
would
simply
have
said
that
in
the
process
of
effectuating
a
change
it
is
not
inappropriate
to
allow
the
time
which
is
in
fact
required
to
carry
out
the
change.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
in
this
case,
i
would
grant
relief
and
hold
that
this
petitioner
is
entitled
to
a
counsel
at
a
new
trial.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
i
would
not
in
his
case.
i
would
not
--
i
would
try
and
try
to
hold
it
down
as
little
as
possible,
but
i
don't
see
how
you
can
say
if
this
court
decides
this
case
on
may
10,
that
on
may
11
there
shall
be
counsel
in
every
court
or
else
the
trial
shall
all
be
invalid,
even
for
short
terms
in
the
work
hours.
many
of
these
petty
offenses
would
really
be
quite
petty.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
very
helpful
if
this
court's
decision
could
make
a
plain
that
under
a
appropriate
circumstances,
the
right
to
counsel
does
not
require
the
presence
of
a
fully
qualified
member
of
the
bar.
for
example,
many
of
these
cases
might
be
handled
very
effectively
by
law
students
under
proper
supervision
and
it
would
be
helpful
if
this
court's
decision
could
recognize
that
possibility.
i
have
been
familiar
with
the
activities
of
law
students
in
court
and
i
would
say
from
experience
that
they
provide
excellent
service.
usually
they
have
much
more
time
available
than
practicing
lawyers
and
they
work
on
their
cases
with
great
energy
and
enthusiasm
and
it
might
also
be
that
other
persons
could
serve
as
counsel
in
certain
types
of
cases,
involving
relatively
small
sentences.
these
might
include
clergymen,
social
workers,
probation
officers
and
other
persons
of
that
type
and
finally
i
have
great
concern
about
the
more
rural
areas
in
the
country,
wyoming,
idaho
or
north
dakota,
or
upstate
new
york.
there
may
well
be
cases
of
family
assaults
where
a
short
jail
sentence
is
appropriate
and
where
there
is
no
lawyer
within
a
100
miles.
in
such
cases
it
seems
to
me
that
real
need
might
be
met
by
the
parents
on
behalf
of
the
defendant
of
a
minister
or
parent
or
a
probation
officer
or
some
other
local
citizens.
often
what
is
needed
in
cases
of
this
sort
is
not
legal
expertise,
but
simply
an
assurance
that
there
is
not
over
reaching
of
some
sort.
i
would
hope
that
this
court's
decision
might
leave
some
flexibility
so
that
cases
in
remote
areas
involving
relatively
minor
penalties
might
be
handled
with
some
sort
of
appropriate
representation
other
than
that
of
fully
qualified
legal
counsel.
this
seems
to
me
to
be
adequately
consistent
with
the
due
process
concept
in
cases
where
the
requirement
of
counsel
is
clearly
stretched
close
to
its
limit.
on
this
basis
i
submit
that
the
decision
below
should
be
reversed
within
the
appropriately
flexible
opinion
of
this
court.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
pleas
the
court.
perhaps
i
am
too
unreconstructed.
what
i
plan
to
do
here
is
to
think
of
the
legal
problem
in
this
case
in
terms
of
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendment,
rather
in
terms
of
the
right
to
counsel
provision
in
the
sixth
amendment.
this
is
a
state
case
and
if
the
sixth
amendment
is
applicable,
it
is
true
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
as
far
as
the
sixth
amendment
alone
is
concerned,
there
are
in
some
minds
at
least,
some
verbal
or
doctrinal
difficulties.
by
its
language,
the
sixth
amendment
guarantee
is
only
the
right
to
have
counsel
and
not
the
right
to
have
counsel
supplied.
i
know
that
the
contrary
was
decided
in
the
gideon
case
and
that
this
was
set
to
rest
on
the
sixth
amendment.
for
some
though
this
has
a
more
understandable
foundation
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
then
there
is
the
fact
that
the
sixth
amendment
by
it
terms
is
applicable
in
all
criminal
prosecutions
and
the
court
has
decided
in
the
duncan
and
baldwin
that
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
also
provided
by
the
sixth
amendment
is
applicable
where
the
penalty
is
more
than
six
months.
on
this
basis,
it
is
contended
as
it
was
decided
below
that
the
right
to
counsel
provision
can
be
applicable
only
where
more
than
six
months
imprisonment
is
involved.
of
course
they
are
authorities
who
are
saying
that
the
same
words
in
a
statute
or
constitution
may
have
different
meanings
and
different
applications.
this
involves
that
some
intellectual
strain,
but
as
i
have
said
it's
easier
for
me
to
deal
with
the
problem
in
terms
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
after
all
it
is
a
case
of
procedural
due
process
which
lies
at
the
heart
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
two,
we
are
more
accustomed
to
think
of
due
process
as
a
developing
idea
then
we
are
define
such
flexibility
in
some
of
the
earlier
amendments.
on
this
basis,
i
look
at
the
gideon
case
which
with
respect
it
seems
to
me
to
have
a
fairly
sound
due
process
foundation
in
considering
the
right
to
counsel.
i
cannot
find
any
basis,
any
logical
ground
to
stand
on
for
saying
that
the
right
to
counsel
exists
for
imprisonment
of
six
months
or
more,
but
does
not
apply
for
imprisonment
for
less
than
six
months.
i
recognize
that
lines
have
to
be
drawn
on
the
law
like
the
age
of
majority
and
that
my
case
is
close
to
the
line
on
each
side
will
not
be
very
different
from
each
others.
however,
with
respect
to
imprisonment
i
find
it
hard
to
draw
a
line
in
any
place.
five
months
imprisonment
seems
to
me
to
be
substantial.
i
do
not
find
much
help
when
the
time
is
reduced
to
ten
days
or
five
days.
there
seems
to
me
to
be
a
difference
in
kind
between
the
imprisonment
of
any
duration
and
merely
monetary
sanctions
or
other
sanctions
which
maybe
imposed
by
judicial
decisions.
these
other
sanctions
maybe
a
serious
burden,
but
they
do
not
keep
involve
depriving
a
person
of
his
liberty
and
that
is
something
fundamental
in
our
society
and
thus
i
have
found
myself
forced
to
the
conclusion
that
there
should
be
a
due
process
right
to
counsel
and
that
this
right
should
be
applicable,
before
any
term
of
imprisonment
can
be
imposed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
any
imprisonment
at
all
is
the
only
place
where
i
can
find
a
satisfactory
place
to
draw
the
line,
drawing
a
distinction
between
imprisonment
and
monetary
penalties
of
one
kind
or
another.
obviously
there
are
problems
at
the
boarder
line,
as
the
case
is
mentioned
by
my
associate
here
where
a
statute
authorizes
imprisonment
but
it
is
rarely
imposed.
i
should
think
that
in
such
cases
the
prosecutor
or
judge
should
make
the
determination
in
advance
or
if
something
develops
at
the
trial
which
makes
imprisonment
seem
appropriate,
and
the
defendant
has
not
had
counsel,
whether
he
had
waived
it
or
not
before
that
without
a
clear
understanding
that
imprisonment
was
a
likely
consequence,
there
should
at
the
defendant's
request
be
a
new
trial
or
a
counsel
will
be
provided
and
very
likely
before
a
different
judge.
if
in
answer
to
chief
justice's
question,
he
says
well
i
stand
on
that
trial,
i
take
it
that
to
be
waiver
of
his
right
to
counsel
but
he
should
have
a
right
to
have
counsel
at
a
new
trial.
if
he
does
not
want
it,
it
should
be
forced
on
him.
this
conclusion
that
counsel
should
be
made
available
for
an
indigent
defendant
before
any
term
of
imprisonment
is
imposed
is
essentially
the
conclusion
which
has
been
reached
by
two
eminent
bodies
which
have
considered
this
problem
not
as
judges,
but
as
persons
vitally
interested
in
developing
proper
standards
for
the
administration
of
criminal
justice.
these
are
the
american
bar
association
and
it
is
minimum
standards
for
criminal
justice
and
the
president's
commission
on
law
enforcement
and
administration
of
justice.
both
are
cited
on
page
17
of
our
brief.
the
bar
association
recommendation
on
this
matter
has
in
substance
been
approved
at
least
three
times
by
the
house
of
delegates
of
the
association
which
is
a
large
and
representative
group
of
the
profession.
because
of
these
reports
and
actions,
i
have
more
confidence
in
the
conclusion
to
which
i
have
felt
myself
compelled
as
an
intellectual
matter,
and
namely
that
counsel
must
be
made
available
to
an
indigent
before
any
sentence
of
imprisonment
can
be
imposed.
i
am
also
confirmed
by
the
excellent
opinion
of
justice
jacobs
of
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
for
an
unanimous
court
in
rodriguez
against
rosenblatt
decided
last
may.
at
this
point
though
another
extremely
difficult
problem
arises.
what
are
the
practical
consequences
of
such
a
conclusion?
what
will
be
required
in
the
way
of
manpower,
can
the
legal
personnel
would
be
made
available.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
i
am
sorry
mr.
justice,
it
is
not
cited
in
our
brief.
it
is
58
new
jersey,
281
and
277
atlantic
second
216.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
although
our
information
about
the
manpower
situation
is
sketchy,
what
we
have
is
encouraging.
as
far
as
the
federal
courts
are
concerned,
a
counsel
is
now
required
in
all
cases
unless
it
is
waived.
that's
rule
44a
of
the
rules
--
federals
rules
of
civil
procedure
and
i
say
the
same
is
applicable
with
respect
to
trials
in
the
magistrate's
courts
because
any
defendant
there
may
elect
to
have
a
trial
in
the
district
court
where
he
can
have
counsel
assigned
to
him
if
he
chooses
in
order
to
save
time
and
to
get
it
over
with
which
i
think
is
often
situation
in
these
new
cases
to
go
ahead
in
the
magistrate's
court,
he
has
had
the
right
to
go
to
the
district
court
and
have
counsel
and
i
find
it
not
too
difficult.
moreover
it
seems
to
me
not
unlikely
that
counsel
can
be
provided
in
the
magistrate's
courts.
the
latest
amendment
of
the
criminal
justice
act
provides
for
compensation
for
counsel
in
these
cases
because
it's
now
been
amended
to
say
wherever
it
is
required
by
the
constitution
and
if
this
court
so
decides,
then
it
will
be
covered.
all
cases
involving
any
imprisonment
have
long
been
covered
in
the
district
of
columbia,
where
there
are
of
course
many
petty
offenses
and
this
is
not
proved
to
be
unbarred.
as
far
as
the
situations
in
the
states
is
concerned
there
is
more
room
for
concern.
however,
the
problems
will
probably
not
be
as
serious
in
actuality
as
the
statistics
on
the
number
of
cases
would
indicate.
in
the
first
place
it
appears
that
merely
half
of
the
states
now
cover
all
or
nearly
all
of
these
cases
and
to
that
extent,
to
the
extent
that
increases
in
services
are
required,
there
all
figures
need
to
be
adjusted
because
it
undoubtedly
is
true
that
it
takes
less
time
to
try
most
misdemeanors
than
it
does
the
more
serious
cases.
moreover,
it
is
likely
that
the
counsel
will
be
waived
more
often
in
cases
of
petty
offenses.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
waivers
might
well
be
more
readily
accepted
in
cases
of
this
sort
and
where
the
charge
is
a
bit
of
serious
felony.
if
the
defendant
in
response
to
inquiry
from
the
court
says
he
does
not
want
counsel,
it
should
not
be
forced
when
the
right
to
counsel
and
usefulness
of
counsel
are
somewhat
attenuated
as
they
are
here.
we
have
considerable
light
on
all
of
these
questions
in
the
two
briefs
of
amicus
curie
which
have
been
filed
in
this
case
on
behalf
of
the
legal
age
society
of
new
york
which
sets
out
actual
experience
in
a
situation
where
counsel
are
required
in
the
cases
of
this
sort
in
our
most
congested
metropolitan
area,
and
the
national
legal
aid
and
defenders
association
and
as
has
been
said
much
the
same
information
is
contained
in
an
article
in
the
recent
issue
of
the
william
and
mary
law
review.
new
york
has
for
sometime
provided
for
representation
in
cases
where
imprisonment
maybe
opposed
--
imposed
and
the
new
york
legal
aid
society
shows
that
the
load
can
be
handled.
so
maybe
other
brief
in
the
article
summarize
experience
in
other
places
which
indicates
that
the
load
though
substantial
is
not
unmanageable.
on
the
basis
of
this
information
and
experience,
i
find
myself
led
to
the
conclusion
that
the
chances
are
that
the
adoption
by
this
court
of
a
rule
that
counsel
must
be
furnished
before
any
imprisonment
maybe
imposed
would
result
in
increasing
the
man
hours
required
of
the
defense
counsel
by
a
50
or
60%.
this
is
a
serious
matter
that
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
insuperable.
i
have
tried
to
put
together
some
figures
but
they
are
much
too
uncertain.
on
the
basis
of
those
figures
i
estimate
that
it
is
perhaps
as
many
as
3,000
additional
lawyers
would
required.
at
$10,000
a
year
that
would
be
a
cost
of
30
million
dollars.
if
you
add
half
of
that
for
secretarial
and
other
personnel,
it
might
get
up
to
as
much
as
50
million
dollars.
whatever
that
financial
load,
this
should
be
manageable
when
allocated
to
the
50
states.
even
though
some
of
the
larger
states
would
have
to
carry
a
considerable
part
of
the
load.
that
california
and
illinois
and
new
york
now
provide
for
counsel
in
these
cases.
thus
a
considerable
part
of
the
additional
load
is
already
undertaken.
other
states
should
now
be
guided
to
do
likewise
just
as
was
the
situation
when
the
gideon
case
itself
was
decided.
in
this
connection
with
respect
to
the
availability
of
lawyers
to
carry
the
task,
i
am
encouraged
by
the
presently
existing
fact
that
there
are
now
twice
as
many
students
in
the
nation's
law
schools
as
they
were
ten
years
ago.
that
young
lawyers
are
starting
their
practice
in
unprecedented
numbers
and
that
it
is
estimated
that
the
number
of
lawyers
in
the
country
will
double
within
the
next
12
or
13
years.
already
concern
is
being
expressed
about
the
openings
which
will
be
available
for
these
new
lawyers.
it
maybe
that
the
recognition
of
the
need
and
the
availability
of
the
means
to
answer
are
about
to
coincide.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
is
not
in
our
brief
mr.
justice.
what
information
there
is,
is
included
in
these
two,
in
the
petitioner's
brief
here
and
in
the
two
briefs
amicus
which
have
been
filed
and
as
far
as
i
know
there
is
no
other
information.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
how
many
states?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
is
--
one
of
the
brief
says
30.
i
said
close
to
half,
counsel
for
the
petitioner
said
10
i
believe.
it
really
boils
down
to
a
question
how
you
define
certain
borderline
matters.
frankly
i
was
not
trying
to
resolve
all
of
those
borderlines
matters.
traffic
offenses,
well
they
vary
all
the
way
from
automobile
man
slaughter
on
the
one
hand
to
failing
to
stop
it
an
intersection
when
there
was
no
other
car
nearby
or
overtime
parking.
the
only
formula
i
have
been
able
to
come
up
here
with
is
before
any
imprisonment
is
in
fact
imposed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
do
not
how
many
mr.
justice.
i
know
that
there
now
a
great
many.
they
used
to
be
only
one
and
i
was
just
quite
instrumental
in
helping
to
bring
that
about,
but
this
is
one
of
the
one
of
the
points
that
i
wanted
bring
out.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
are
great
many
states.
there
has
been
a
movement
in
recent
years
in
that
direction.
i
am
concerned
about
the
quality
of
the
service
that
will
be
performed
by
practicing
members
of
the
bar.
it
can
be
rather
stultifying
to
be
assigned
to
go
to
courtroom
14
and
represent
a
100
people
this
morning.
even
that
might
be
better
than
no
representation,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
what
we
to
do
is
setup
the
standard
and
then
rely
on
local
courts,
bar
association,
legal
aid
agencies
and
so
on,
to
try
and
find
ways
to
see
that
the
representation
is
appropriately
provided
and
consistently
to
the
efficiency
of
the
courts.
this
also
was
a
matter
of
legitimate
concern.
the
introduction
of
counsel
in
the
more
cases
will
require
more
pre-trials
time
of
prosecutors
and
more
courtroom
time
and
this
will
lead
the
bigger
backlogs
with
present
personnel.
court
reporters
will
be
needed
as
well
as
counsel
and
that's
one
of
our
worst
bottlenecks.
it
seems
equally
clear
that
we
need
more
courtroom
personnel
and
the
only
way
we
would
get
it
is
by
building
up
the
pressure
which
will
make
it
clear
that
such
personnel
must
be
provided.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
this
court
has
more
less
intimated
as
much
in
the
some
cases.
it
is
rather
difficult
to
carry
out
an
appeal
without
a
transcript
and
i
would
suspect
as
practical
matter
that
it
would
be
found
the
court
reporters
were
necessary
where
counsel
were
provided.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
but
i
think
it
to
serious
problem
that
not
only
this
cases
but
in
all
criminal
cases
that
we
ought
to
find
ways
to
improve
perhaps
by
putting
court
reporters
on
salaries
rather
than
having
them
paid
by
piece
work
because
we
now
do.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
states
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
federal
courts
are
very
much
in
that
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
suspect
the
state
courts
have
more
trouble
than
the
federal
courts
do
on
this.
i
am
not
really
familiar
with
nationwide
with
the
state
court
situation
with
the
respect
to
the
reporters.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
whatever
it
was
mr.
justice,
it
would
of
course
there
would
be
no
need
for
a
reporter.
i
have
a
final
word.
if
this
step
is
taken
i
have
the
feeling
that
it
should
be
expressly
made
none
retroactive.
presumably
that's
not
very
important,
since
relatively
short
sentences
are
involved.
however,
i
would
go
even
further
and
respectfully
suggest
that
the
court's
decision
should
expressly
provide
that
it
would
not
become
fully
effective
for
some
period
in
the
future,
say
for
year
or
until
january
1,
1974.
this
will
give
the
states
an
opportunity
to
adjust
to
the
new
requirement.
without
something
like
this
if
for
example
even
without
retroactivity
this
court's
decision
should
become
fully
applicable
on
the
day
it
is
announced,
there
could
be
a
massive
pile
up
in
the
state
courts
which
do
not
now
meet
the
standard.
this
would
involve
delays
and
frustrations
which
would
not
be
a
real
contribution
to
the
administration
of
justice.
i
recognize
that
such
a
provision,
may
i
have
a
three
minutes
more
mr.
chief
justice,
thank
you.
i
recognize
that
such
a
provision
with
the
unusual,
but
it
would
not
be
unlike
the
powers
exercised
by
courts
of
equity
in
abetting
the
nuisance
for
example
which
allow
time
to
the
parties
to
take
the
step
which
are
necessary
to
effectuate
the
court's
decision.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
do
know
mr.
justice.
i
think
that
this
is
a
--
this
is
getting
out
to
a
place
where
things
are
very
attenuated
and
i
find
it
easier
to
accept
that
recognition
of
not
fully
complying
with
what
the
court
now
regards
the
constitutional
requirement
to
be
than
it
is
to
say
we
must
comply
and
everything
is
in
chaos.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
certainly
that
has
been
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice
i
am
(voice
overlap)
simply
speaking
your
(inaudible).
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
sir,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
with
respect
to
the
constitution
that
does
not,
does
not
shock
me.
with
respect
the
constitutional
requirements,
i
would
have
put
it
that
way
myself.
i
would
simply
have
said
that
in
the
process
of
effectuating
a
change
it
is
not
inappropriate
to
allow
the
time
which
is
in
fact
required
to
carry
out
the
change.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
in
this
case,
i
would
grant
relief
and
hold
that
this
petitioner
is
entitled
to
a
counsel
at
a
new
trial.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
i
would
not
in
his
case.
i
would
not
--
i
would
try
and
try
to
hold
it
down
as
little
as
possible,
but
i
don't
see
how
you
can
say
if
this
court
decides
this
case
on
may
10,
that
on
may
11
there
shall
be
counsel
in
every
court
or
else
the
trial
shall
all
be
invalid,
even
for
short
terms
in
the
work
hours.
many
of
these
petty
offenses
would
really
be
quite
petty.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
very
helpful
if
this
court's
decision
could
make
a
plain
that
under
a
appropriate
circumstances,
the
right
to
counsel
does
not
require
the
presence
of
a
fully
qualified
member
of
the
bar.
for
example,
many
of
these
cases
might
be
handled
very
effectively
by
law
students
under
proper
supervision
and
it
would
be
helpful
if
this
court's
decision
could
recognize
that
possibility.
i
have
been
familiar
with
the
activities
of
law
students
in
court
and
i
would
say
from
experience
that
they
provide
excellent
service.
usually
they
have
much
more
time
available
than
practicing
lawyers
and
they
work
on
their
cases
with
great
energy
and
enthusiasm
and
it
might
also
be
that
other
persons
could
serve
as
counsel
in
certain
types
of
cases,
involving
relatively
small
sentences.
these
might
include
clergymen,
social
workers,
probation
officers
and
other
persons
of
that
type
and
finally
i
have
great
concern
about
the
more
rural
areas
in
the
country,
wyoming,
idaho
or
north
dakota,
or
upstate
new
york.
there
may
well
be
cases
of
family
assaults
where
a
short
jail
sentence
is
appropriate
and
where
there
is
no
lawyer
within
a
100
miles.
in
such
cases
it
seems
to
me
that
real
need
might
be
met
by
the
parents
on
behalf
of
the
defendant
of
a
minister
or
parent
or
a
probation
officer
or
some
other
local
citizens.
often
what
is
needed
in
cases
of
this
sort
is
not
legal
expertise,
but
simply
an
assurance
that
there
is
not
over
reaching
of
some
sort.
i
would
hope
that
this
court's
decision
might
leave
some
flexibility
so
that
cases
in
remote
areas
involving
relatively
minor
penalties
might
be
handled
with
some
sort
of
appropriate
representation
other
than
that
of
fully
qualified
legal
counsel.
this
seems
to
me
to
be
adequately
consistent
with
the
due
process
concept
in
cases
where
the
requirement
of
counsel
is
clearly
stretched
close
to
its
limit.
on
this
basis
i
submit
that
the
decision
below
should
be
reversed
within
the
appropriately
flexible
opinion
of
this
court.
