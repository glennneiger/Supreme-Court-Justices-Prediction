justice

h.
rehnquist
mr.
rogow
let
me
ask
you
along
the
line
of
chief
justice's
question.
the
situation
in
my
home
state
of
arizona
where
coconino
county
which
has
an
area
of
20,000
square
miles
and
has
one
county
seat
where
the
superior
court
sits,
but
justice
courts
that
are
spread
out
over
an
area
that
it
is
larger
than
that
of
many
of
the
states,
where
ordinarily
they
are
simply
are
not
lawyers
in
residence.
now
wouldn't
be
application
of
your
rule
virtually
require
the
abolition
of
justice
court's
jurisdiction
in
an
area
of
that
side?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
have
we
ever
done
that
in
the
constitutional
decision,
made
it
applicable
for
a
year
or
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
aren't
most
misdemeanors
automatically
bailable
in
florida?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
pressure
of
this
speedy
trial
from
the
defendant
and
it
will
presumably
a
little
bit
less
than
if
they
were
being
held
in
jail,
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
do
--
isn't
there
a
greater
propensity
to
or
a
higher
percentage
of
prisoners
awaiting
felony
trials
being
held
for
one
of
bail
or
other
decision
of
the
court
to
be
person
should
not
in
fact
be
bailed,
that
it
is
a
case
of
misdemeanor?
