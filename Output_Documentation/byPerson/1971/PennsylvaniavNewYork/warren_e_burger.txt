commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
against
the
state
of

york
and
others.
mr.
rosenberger,
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
mean
by
that
mr.
rosenberger
that
you
can
put
a
couple
of
reasonably
trained
accountants
on
the
job
and
they
could
come
up
with
all
the
essential
facts
under
the
test
you
are
now
discussing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
ahern.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
but
if
new
york
moved
in
that
direction,
would
it
not
be
within
the
power
of
this
court
to
place
a
trust
of
some
nature
on
it
to
be
sure
that
no
subsequent
legislation
of
new
york
could
alter
that
status?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
state
of
the
size
of
new
york
with
its
enormous
operations
and
probably
has
bank
balances
many,
many
times
exceeding
this,
that
is
unused
money?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mrs.
wentworth
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mrs.
wentworth.
mr.
greenfield.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
if
you
were
taking
about
a
jurisdictional
problem
in
the
context
of
a
long-arm
statute,
i
would
find
that
all
of
those
factors
very,
very
relevant,
but
why
isn't
the
place
of
issue,
what's
your
view
about
the
place
of
origin
or
issue
as
the
most
equitable
and
practical,
laying
aside
other
factors?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
talking
about
the
place
where
someone
goes
in,
puts
the
money
on
the
counter,
and
get
the
money
order,
whatever
name
you
want
to
give
that
place?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
of
course,
that's
that's
because
a
lot
of
the
factors
in
the
case
of
this
kind
are
simply
unknowable
and
the
pursuit
to
get
the
details
in
each
instance
would
be
to
costly
to
determine,
but
i
am
talking
about
a
practical
equitable
test?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
but
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what's
the
range
of
amounts
if
–
the
record
shows
that
i
missed
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
a
mean
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
a
mean
figure
in
this
record?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
just
trying
to
guess
that
figure
as
an
average,
but
wouldn't,
pursuing
what
justice
white
suggested
to
you,
isn't
that
a
matter
that's
so
commonly
related
to
ordinary
human
experience,
that
it
could
be
judicially
noticed?
whether
it's
controlling
or
not,
is
another
question,
but
as
a
fact
issue,
couldn't
this
court
or
the
master
judicially
notice
that
for
the
most
part,
people
send
money
orders
from
home
base
to
some
other
place
to
the
son
in
college,
to
an
impecunious
relative
or
friend
who
wires
for
some
money
or
one
of
your
children
who
is
on
a
vacation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
greenfield.
mr.
rosenberger,
do
you
have
anything
further?
