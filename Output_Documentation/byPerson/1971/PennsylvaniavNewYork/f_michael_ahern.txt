mr.
f.
michael
ahern
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
interest
of
brevity
and
in
order
to
avoid
repetition,
the
state
of
connecticut
subscribes
to
the
oral
arguments
advanced
to
you
this
morning
by
my
colleague
from
the
state
of
pennsylvania.
i
would
just
like
to
touch
on
one
point
which
has
not
been
mentioned.
under
the
recommendation
of
the
special
master
in
this
case,
the
state
of
new
york
will
take
all
of
the
unclaimed
monies,
presently
held
by
western
union.
in
its
oral
argument
and
its
briefs,
new
york
emphasizes
the
fact
that
under
the
new
york
abandoned
property
law,
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations
and
therefore
the
owners
of
this
property,
of
these
monies
will
be
protected,
because
the
state
of
new
york
will
not
be
in
a
position
to
foreclose
their
claiming
it
at
any
time
in
the
future.
the
inference
is
that
the
state
of
new
york
will
hold
these
monies
ad
infinitum.
however,
i
submit
that
there
is
no
prohibition
which
i
am
aware
of
whereby
the
state
of
new
york
legislature
could
not
pass
a
mandatory
legislation
which
would
provide
for
the
escheat
of
these
funds
to
the
state
of
new
york.
what
i
am
suggesting
to
this
court
is
that
whatever
states
take
the
monies
now
held
by
western
union
by
virtue
of
an
order
of
this
court,
a
decision
of
this
court,
the
monies
eventually
will
find
their
way
into
the
general
treasuries
of
the
state.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
well,
they
would
hold
them
custodially,
but
they
wouldn't
be
able
to
use
the
funds
for
general
purposes.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
they
would
be
getting
interest
justice
rehnquist,
but
they
wouldn't
be
able
to
use
the
funds.
if
they
passed
an
escheat
law,
they
would
eventually
be
able
to
use
the
funds
themselves.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
would
assume
the
court
could
issue
such
an
order,
yes
mr.
chief
justice
burger.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
that
maybe
true
mr.
chief
justice,
but
with
the
continuing
cry
for
more
revenue
by
all
of
the
states,
i
think
the
state
of
new
york
is
seeking
this
money
for
purposes
other
than
just
to
hold
it
custodially
or
they
wouldn't
have
the
fine
array
of
legal
talent
here
aggressively
pursuing
their
rights.
thank
you
very
much.
