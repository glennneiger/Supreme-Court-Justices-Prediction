mr.
julius
greenfield
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
ten
years
after
this
court's
decision
in
western
union
against
pennsylvania
in
which
the
pennsylvania
claim
was
substantially
similar
to
the
claim
it
is
making
now
and
more
than
five
years
after
this
court's
decision
in
texas
against
new
jersey,
this
matter
is
again
before
the
court.
the
holding
of
that
court
in
western
union
against
pennsylvania
was
that
in
view
of
the
claims
made
by
new
york
in
a
situation
in
which
pennsylvania
was
saying
that
the
state
of
office
of
origin
should
control.
the
court
felt
that
the
matters
of
this
kind
should
be
determined
by
this
court.
in
texas
against
new
jersey,
which
dealt
with
various
categories
of
unclaimed
property,
including
unclaimed
checks,
owing
to
creditors
some
of
whose
last
known
addresses
were
unknown
and
this
is
stated
in
the
court's
opinion.
the
court
granted
leave
to
file
the
complaint
in
that
case
because
it
had
made
its
determination
in
western
union
that
only
one
state
could
escheat
particular
property.
the
court
said
that
since
the
states
separately
were
without
power
to
settle
a
controversy,
a
rule
should
be
adopted
by
the
court
which
“will
settle
the
question
of
which
state
will
be
allowed
to
escheat
this
intangible
property.”
texas
in
that
case
argued
for
the
context
test.
the
court
said
this
kind
of
a
rule,
a
contacts
rule,
would
leave
the
question
in
permanent
(inaudible)
and
the
question
should
be
settled
once
and
for
all
by
a
clear
rule
which
will
govern
all
kinds
of
intangibles
like
these
and
to
which
the
states
may
refer
with
confidence.
referring
again
to
weston
union
against
pennsylvania,
the
court
said,
that
it
was
faced
with
the
problem
of
deciding
which
state
had
a
claim,
which
was
superior
to
all
other
states.
the
court
then
held
that
the
context
test
was
not
workable,
that
it
would,
the
context
test
require
examination
of
each
particular
item
of
property
on
its
peculiar
facts
and
that
the
context
test
would
be
uncertain
and
would
require
decision
on
the
basis
of
continually
developing
facts.
the
court
then
said
that,
the
state
of
the
debtor's
principal
office
could
have
a
persuasive
claim.
and
i
think
it
should
be
noted
that
new
york
is
not
making
the
claim
solely
because
it
is
the
domiciliary
state
and
i
would
like
to
bring
this
into
the
context
of
the
determination
western
union
against
new
jersey
--
western
union
against
pennsylvania.
i
think
it
should
be
noted
that
there
are
the
concurrence
of
the
following
facts
with
reference
to
new
york
in
this
matter.
number
one,
new
york
is
the
state
of
corporate
domicile;
number
two,
new
york
is
the
situs
of
the
principal
office
of
western
union.
number
three,
new
york
is
the
situs
of
the
executive
offices
of
western
union.
new
york
is
the
place
where
the
books
of
account
are
maintained.
new
york
is
the
place
where
the
board
of
directors
meet.
new
york
is
the
place
where
management
and
fiscal
policy
are
determined,
and
new
york
is
the
place
where
the
company
treasury
is
located
and
to
whom
all
access
funds
are
ultimately
remitted.
mr.
julius
greenfield
well,
in
first
place
your
honor
i
think
that
the
place
of
issuance
will
frequently
differ
from
the
place
of
origin
and
that
is
an
important
concept
--
mr.
julius
greenfield
i
think
that
the
record
in
western
union
against
pennsylvania
will
perhaps
answer
that
question
best.
in
western
union
against
pennsylvania,
there
was
a
stipulation
between
the
two
parties
of
that
litigation,
western
union
and
pennsylvania
in
which
they
stipulated
that
in
many
cases,
the
state
of
office
of
origin
did
not
coincide
with
the
state
of
last
known
address
of
the
creditor
and
in
the
jurisdictional
statement,
filed
in
that
case
by
western
union
the
following
appears.
mr.
julius
greenfield
well
sir,
i
think
it's
important.
i
would
like
to
come
to
this
later
on
if
may,
but
in
partial
answer
to
your
question
right
now,
the
records
of
western
union
are
maintained
in
such
a
fashion
that
the
application
forms
are
available.
it
is
possible
to
determine
in
many
of
these
cases
what
the
last
known
address
of
the
creditor
is
and
this
isn't
merely
a
matter
of
the
practical
application
of
a
search
for
those
last
known
addresses.
i
don't
think
that
the
question
of
escheat
should
depend
upon
whether
or
not
a
particular
debtor
keeps
adequate
records.
mr.
julius
greenfield
they
are
in
minnesota,
sir.
mr.
julius
greenfield
yes
sir.
mr.
julius
greenfield
pardon.
mr.
julius
greenfield
well,
i
think
this
is
a
matter
of
a
spatial
question.
if
we
were
faced
with
a
necessity
of
proving
that
they
were
no
last
known
addresses
in
a
particular
group
of
cases
then
we
feel
that
we
should
bear
that
burden,
but
we
also
feel
that
the
other
state
should
bear
their
burden
of
proving
that
they
are
last
known
addresses
in
particular
states.
mr.
julius
greenfield
this
is
one
of
the
offices
maintained
by
western
union
for
that
purpose.
mr.
julius
greenfield
i
suppose.
that
probably
is
one
of
the
reasons.
i
would
like
to
mr.
chief
justice
to
refer
to
the
jurisdictional
statement
because
reference
has
been
made
by
pennsylvania
to
the
fact
that
there
is
some
kind
of
presumption
that's
available
that
the
state
of
last
known
address
follows
the
state
of
office
of
origin,
and
this
is
the
jurisdictional
statement
which
was
made
by
western
union
in
the
western
union
against
the
pennsylvania
case.
“even
as
to
payees,
who
received
drafts
at
offices
of
the
appellant
in
pennsylvania,
there
is
no
showing
and
there
can
be
no
basis
for
presuming
that
they
were
residents
of
pennsylvania
at
a
time
of
receipt.”
mr.
julius
greenfield
the
significance
of
the
point
i
made
was
this
judge
that
pennsylvania
is
relying
upon
only
presumption
of
the
state
of
origin
being
the
state
of
last
known
address.
the
point
i
am
making
is
that
there
is
no
proof
in
this
record,
there
is
no
basis
for
the
presumption
in
this
record,
before
this
court
for
such
a
determination.
and
the
only
thing
that
you
have
to
rely
upon
is
something
that
is
familiarly
referred
to
as
logic
in
the
situation.
we
must
realize
that
we're
dealing
with
a
mobile
society
and
i
am
sure,
i
know
that
you
are
fully
aware
of
that,
and
that
people
do
not
always
or
a
customarily
reside
in
the
place
where
they
buy
money
orders.
mr.
julius
greenfield
there
is
--
there
is
that
possibility,
but
i
simply
point
out
to
you
judge
that
on
the
state
of
the
record
before
this
court,
there
is
no
basis
for
the
presumption
urged
by
pennsylvania.
mr.
julius
greenfield
no
sir,
i
do
not
think
it
is
beyond
your
reach.
mr.
julius
greenfield
i
wouldn't
characterize
it
as
irrational,
but
i
would
say
--
mr.
julius
greenfield
--
that
it
was
unfounded
because
it
was
not
based
upon
sufficient
information.
mr.
julius
greenfield
i
am
not
talking
only
about
the
record
judge,
i
am
saying
that
there
is
nothing
that
we
know
of.
mr.
julius
greenfield
that's
true.
mr.
julius
greenfield
i
don't
know
whether
that
assumption
is
tenable
judge.
mr.
julius
greenfield
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
but
i
think
--
mr.
julius
greenfield
offices
of
western
union
in
new
york?
mr.
julius
greenfield
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
sir.
mr.
julius
greenfield
of
course
there
are,
of
course
there
are.
mr.
julius
greenfield
the
possibility
it
is
that
money
did
not
come
from
new
york
--
mr.
julius
greenfield
well
the
probability
does
exist
but
what
i
was
trying
to
point
out
to
your
honor
is
that
new
york
being
the
largest
commercial
state
in
the
united
states
and
the
most
active
commercial
state
that
this
kind
of
thing
could
emanate
to
a
very
considerable
extent
from
new
york.
mr.
julius
greenfield
i
am
sorry.
mr.
julius
greenfield
that
maybe
so.
mr.
julius
greenfield
my
understanding
is
that
the
amounts
range
is
rather
small
--
mr.
julius
greenfield
five
dollar
level
--
mr.
julius
greenfield
no,
there
isn't,
but
i
understand
that
their
level
would
range
up
to
about
$25
and
perhaps
more.
mr.
julius
greenfield
the
answer
to
that
your
honor
i
think
in
part
at
least
when
referring
to
the
special
master's
report
is
that
the
special
master
found
to
the
contrary.
he
found
that
there
was
no
reasonable
basis
for
this
presumption.
mr.
julius
greenfield
there
was
no
reasonable
basis
for
this
presumption.
mr.
julius
greenfield
no,
i
don't
think
that's
quite
the
way
i
would
put
it.
i
think
that
the
court
has
an
obvious
right
to
recognize
what
it
considers
to
be
the
ordinary
state
effect.
what
i
am
saying
and
what
i
have
continued
to
say
that
in
the
state
of
this
record,
there
is
no
basis
for
that
presumption.
furthermore,
both
of
the
parties,
both
pennsylvania
and
western
union
have
said
in
the
past,
that
there
is
no
basis
for
such
a
determination.
in
texas
against
new
jersey,
the
court
rejected
a
context
test
theory
and
adopted
the
rule
that
is
well
known
to
this
court
and
that
is,
as
to
each
item
of
property,
the
property
should
go
to
the
state
of
last
known
address
of
the
creditor
as
shown
on
the
books
of
the
debtor
cooperation,
and
the
secondary
rule
was
that
the
state
of
domicile
of
the
corporation
would
take
if
that
address
was
not
available.
i
think
something
has
been
made
by
pennsylvania
of
the
fact
that
this
theory
requires
that
there
be
a
last
known
street
address.
i
think
that
the
texas
of
case
does
not
require
any
such
showing,
but
merely
requires
a
showing
that
the
last
known
address
of
the
creditor
was
within
a
particular
state.
mr.
julius
greenfield
this
has
been
defined
by
the
special
master
i
think
satisfactorily
to
everybody
involved
in
the
case.
in
the
case
in
which
a
money
order
is
issued,
the
person
to
whom
it
is
issued
is
the
creditor.
in
the
case
where
a
money
order
is
issued
to
the
payee,
he
is
the
creditor.
in
the
case,
where
a
money
order
is
sent
for
the
benefit
of
a
payee,
but
he
doesn't
pick
it
up,
the
money
order
is
canceled.
provision
is
made
for
the
sender
to
be
notified,
that
he
should
pick
up
the
funds.a
draft
maybe
issued
to
him
under
those
circumstances
in
which
event
he
is
the
creditor.
but
to
answer
your
question
as
concisely
as
i
can,
a
sender
is
the
creditor
unless
a
money
order
has
been
issued
to
the
payee
in
which
event
the
payee
is
the
creditor.
a
reference
was
made
to
special
master's
report
insofar
as
its
requirements
concerning
the
burden
of
proof.
i
would
like
again
to
point
out
that
the
special
master
reported
that
the
creditor's
last
known
address
is
his
conscious
choice
whereas
the
initiation
of
a
transaction
in
a
particular
office
of
origin
might
merely
be
a
matter
of
choice
or
convenience
and
the
special
master
pointed
out
too
that
the
sender
might
have
been
in
that
jurisdiction
for
only
an
hour
or
for
a
day.
i
don’t
think
it’s
necessary
any
longer
to
respond
to
the
contentions
of
florida,
in
view
of
the
fact
they
have
now
joined
the
pennsylvania
position.
but
i
would
point
to
the
fact
that
in
his
conclusion,
the
special
master
determine
that
the
texas
rule
is
a
simple
and
workable
formula
and
that
it
sets
in
easily
administered
standard,
preventing
multiple
claims
and
giving
all
the
parties
a
fixed
and
reliable
rule.
to
adopt
a
rule
of
the
kind
that
is
now
sponsored
by
pennsylvania
and
its
adherence,
it
would
seem
to
us,
brings
us
into
the
kind
of
problem
that
mr.
justice
stewart
referred
to
in
his
two
dissents
in
the
western
union
case
and
in
the
texas
against
new
jersey
case,
that
is
that
those
cases
would
can
cause
more
problems
than
they
solve.
and
the
point
that
i
am
making
by
stating
that
is
that,
if
reliance
is
to
be
had
upon
such
a
thing
as
a
presumption
of
the
office
of
origin
being
the
state
of
last
known
address
then
i
suggest
that
the
court
is
leaving
itself
in
for
determinations
in
every
kind
of
case
in
which
the
factual
situation
differs
from
texas
against
new
jersey.
mr.
julius
greenfield
i
don’t
think
there
would
be
any
problem
with
that.
this
is
a
point
i
was
making
before
judge
that
these
cases
should
not
depend
upon
whether
or
not
a
particular
debtor
keeps
its
records
properly.
mr.
julius
greenfield
i
don’t
think
there
would
be,
because
as
i
have
said
before
we
support
the
special
master's
report
which
says,
give
it
to
the
state
of
last
known
address
of
the
creditor.
mr.
julius
greenfield
as
shown
on
the
creditor's
books.
mr.
julius
greenfield
yes
he
does.
mr.
julius
greenfield
i
don’t
know
whether
that
estimate
is
a
reliable
estimate,
but
as
i
have
said
before
new
york
is
prepared
to
bear
its
burden
in
supporting
its
claim.
mr.
julius
greenfield
i
don’t
know
sir.
i
accept
what
mrs.
wentworth
said.
we
would
suggest
that
in
grafting
upon
the
texas
against
new
jersey
determination
a
new
category
of
state
taking
them,
that
is
when
the
records
of
the
debtor
cooperation
are
inadequately
kept,
a
presumption
should
arise
that
the
state
of
the
last
known
address
is
the
state
of
inception
of
a
transaction.
mr.
julius
greenfield
with
one
possible
variation
of
what
you
have
said
judge,
yes,
i
think
it
is
important
to
point
out
that
our
statue
is
--
mr.
julius
greenfield
--
entirely
an
custody
statute.
mr.
julius
greenfield
yes
sir.
mr.
julius
greenfield
i
don't
follow
what
you
are
saying
judge?
you
say
that
the
address
is
the
address
of
sender
but
you
don’t
have
the
address
of
the
sender.
mr.
julius
greenfield
if
you
accept
that
presumption.
mr.
julius
greenfield
i
think
that
will
be
necessary.
mr.
julius
greenfield
i
think
there
are
several
answers
to
that,
your
honor.
in
the
first
place
our
statute
is
a
pure
custodial
statute,
it
is
never
escheated,
the
property
is
never
escheated,
it
is
aways
available
for
a
claim
by
the
owners
and
we
have
had
a
history
of
considerable
claims
for
refunds
in
many
of
these
situations.
the
point
that
you
are
making
i
assume
is
that
if
the
funds
are
not
claimed,
another
state
can
ultimately
come
in
and
say
this
money
belongs
to
us.
but
this
is
exactly
what
texas
against
new
jersey
said,
texas
against
new
jersey
says
that,
”when
funds
are
paid
to
the
domiciliary
state
in
the
absence
of
a
last
known
address
on
the
books
of
the
debtor
corporation,
it
is
subject
to
reclamation
by
another
state
upon
a
showing
that
the
last
known
address
was
in
that
state.”
mr.
julius
greenfield
as
i
said
before
judge,
i
don't
think
that
it
is
fair
to
characterize
that
as
an
escheat
because
we
have
a
history
of
considerable
amounts
of
claims
made
after
property
has
been
paid
into
our
abandoned
property
funds.
mr.
julius
greenfield
well,
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
the
new
york
state
legislature
from
adopting
such
a
statute,
but
i
would
simply
call
to
your
attention
that
the
preamble
to
our
abandoned
property
law
which
i
believe
was
one
of
the
forerunners
of
all
of
the
abandoned
property
laws
in
this
country
is
that
these
funds
are
to
be
used
for
the
benefit
of
the
public
at
large
while
protecting
the
interests
of
the
persons
to
whom,
who
are
entitled
to
these
funds.
and
i
know
of
no
movement
in
the
state
of
new
york
to
turn
this
statute
into
an
escheat
statute.
i
would
call
to
the
attention
to
the
court
the
fact
as
i
did
before
that
this
court
did
not
close
it's
eyes
to
the
western
union
situation
when
it
determined
texas
against
new
jersey.
indeed
as
i
have
already
noted,
the
court
based
it's
determination
in
texas
that
leave
should
be
granted
to
file
a
complaint
because
it
had
held
in
western
union
against
pennsylvania
that
the
due
process
clause
prevented
any
one
state
from
escheating
a
given
item
of
a
property.
thus
when
the
court
decided
texas
against
new
jersey,
it
had
already
been
confronted
with
the
factual
situations
with
which
we
are
confronted
here
today.
and
accordingly,
it
was
thoroughly
aware
of
those
facts
when
it
formulated
the
unqualified
texas
rule
for
disposition
of
intangibles
of
all
kinds.
as
i
have
indicated
before
the
pennsylvania
assertion
that
the
predominant
right
of
the
state
where
the
transaction
or
purchase
occurred
is
not
really
based
upon
such
statutes
as
the
uniform
disposition
of
unclaimed
property
act
which
as
it's
said
has
been
adopted
by
a
number
of
states
and
i
might
call
to
the
court’s
attention
that
when
an
uniform
act
is
adopted
by
the
various
states,
it
is
uniform
generally
only
to
the
word
uniform.
the
uniform
statute,
the
revised
uniform
disposition
of
unclaimed
property
act
does
not
provide
for
taking
by
a
state
which
is
the
office
of
origin.
it
provides
for
taking
by
a
state
in
which
the
written
instruments
are
issued
and
then
significantly
the
uniform
act
also
provides
that
the
state
in
which
that
act
is
adopted
will
not
claim
the
money
if
another
state
in
which
the
last
known
address
resides,
takes
the
property
and
has
a
reciprocal
provision
with
the
other
state.
if
the
pennsylvania
proposal
is
to
be
considered
then
it
would
seem
to
us
that
other
and
equally
and
perhaps
more
compelling
material
alternative
should
be
considered
by
the
court.
for
example,
and
i
think
this
pointed
up
by
at
least
one
decision
by
this
court,
connecticut
life
insurance
against
moore,
should
you
not
be
considering
such
things
as
the
place
of
resident
of
the
sender
when
he
died.
and
the
place
where
the
sender
was
last
known
to
reside
or
the
place
of
a
proved
later
or
longer
residence
of
the
sender
or
the
state
of
actual
domicile
of
the
sender
or
the
state
of
actual
delivery
of
the
draft
or
the
state
in
which
the
funds
were
maintained
for
satisfaction
of
a
draft
or
the
state
in
which
the
sendee
died
or
the
state
in
which
the
sendee
was
last
known
to
reside
or
the
state
of
a
proved
later
or
longer
residence
of
the
sendee
or
the
state
of
actual
domicile
of
the
sendee.
the
reason
why
i
have
gone
into
this
long
statement
of
the
various
alternatives
is
that
all
of
these
alternatives
were
rejected
by
the
texas
court.
the
context
test
is
not
really
a
workable
test
at
all
and
the
test
that
suggests
that
the
court
should
examine
the
circumstances
surrounding
each
particular
item
of
escheatable
property,
on
it's
particular
facts
and
then
try
to
make
it
difficult
often
quite
subjective
decision
as
to
which
state's
claim
seems
stronger
than
another,
is
it
seems
to
us
intolerable.
you
would
have,
perhaps
hundreds
of
cases
of
this
kind
before
you,
consequently
this
court
should
refuse
to
adopt
the
rule
in
which
results
in
treating
this
subject
on
a
case
by
case
basis
and
we
submit
that
the
rule
adopted
in
texas
against
new
jersey
is
fully
applicable
here
and
that
the
proposed
decree
of
the
special
master
should
be
adopted.
thank
you.
mr.
julius
greenfield
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
ten
years
after
this
court's
decision
in
western
union
against
pennsylvania
in
which
the
pennsylvania
claim
was
substantially
similar
to
the
claim
it
is
making
now
and
more
than
five
years
after
this
court's
decision
in
texas
against
new
jersey,
this
matter
is
again
before
the
court.
the
holding
of
that
court
in
western
union
against
pennsylvania
was
that
in
view
of
the
claims
made
by
new
york
in
a
situation
in
which
pennsylvania
was
saying
that
the
state
of
office
of
origin
should
control.
the
court
felt
that
the
matters
of
this
kind
should
be
determined
by
this
court.
in
texas
against
new
jersey,
which
dealt
with
various
categories
of
unclaimed
property,
including
unclaimed
checks,
owing
to
creditors
some
of
whose
last
known
addresses
were
unknown
and
this
is
stated
in
the
court's
opinion.
the
court
granted
leave
to
file
the
complaint
in
that
case
because
it
had
made
its
determination
in
western
union
that
only
one
state
could
escheat
particular
property.
the
court
said
that
since
the
states
separately
were
without
power
to
settle
a
controversy,
a
rule
should
be
adopted
by
the
court
which
“will
settle
the
question
of
which
state
will
be
allowed
to
escheat
this
intangible
property.”
texas
in
that
case
argued
for
the
context
test.
the
court
said
this
kind
of
a
rule,
a
contacts
rule,
would
leave
the
question
in
permanent
(inaudible)
and
the
question
should
be
settled
once
and
for
all
by
a
clear
rule
which
will
govern
all
kinds
of
intangibles
like
these
and
to
which
the
states
may
refer
with
confidence.
referring
again
to
weston
union
against
pennsylvania,
the
court
said,
that
it
was
faced
with
the
problem
of
deciding
which
state
had
a
claim,
which
was
superior
to
all
other
states.
the
court
then
held
that
the
context
test
was
not
workable,
that
it
would,
the
context
test
require
examination
of
each
particular
item
of
property
on
its
peculiar
facts
and
that
the
context
test
would
be
uncertain
and
would
require
decision
on
the
basis
of
continually
developing
facts.
the
court
then
said
that,
the
state
of
the
debtor's
principal
office
could
have
a
persuasive
claim.
and
i
think
it
should
be
noted
that
new
york
is
not
making
the
claim
solely
because
it
is
the
domiciliary
state
and
i
would
like
to
bring
this
into
the
context
of
the
determination
western
union
against
new
jersey
--
western
union
against
pennsylvania.
i
think
it
should
be
noted
that
there
are
the
concurrence
of
the
following
facts
with
reference
to
new
york
in
this
matter.
number
one,
new
york
is
the
state
of
corporate
domicile;
number
two,
new
york
is
the
situs
of
the
principal
office
of
western
union.
number
three,
new
york
is
the
situs
of
the
executive
offices
of
western
union.
new
york
is
the
place
where
the
books
of
account
are
maintained.
new
york
is
the
place
where
the
board
of
directors
meet.
new
york
is
the
place
where
management
and
fiscal
policy
are
determined,
and
new
york
is
the
place
where
the
company
treasury
is
located
and
to
whom
all
access
funds
are
ultimately
remitted.
mr.
julius
greenfield
well,
in
first
place
your
honor
i
think
that
the
place
of
issuance
will
frequently
differ
from
the
place
of
origin
and
that
is
an
important
concept
--
mr.
julius
greenfield
i
think
that
the
record
in
western
union
against
pennsylvania
will
perhaps
answer
that
question
best.
in
western
union
against
pennsylvania,
there
was
a
stipulation
between
the
two
parties
of
that
litigation,
western
union
and
pennsylvania
in
which
they
stipulated
that
in
many
cases,
the
state
of
office
of
origin
did
not
coincide
with
the
state
of
last
known
address
of
the
creditor
and
in
the
jurisdictional
statement,
filed
in
that
case
by
western
union
the
following
appears.
mr.
julius
greenfield
well
sir,
i
think
it's
important.
i
would
like
to
come
to
this
later
on
if
may,
but
in
partial
answer
to
your
question
right
now,
the
records
of
western
union
are
maintained
in
such
a
fashion
that
the
application
forms
are
available.
it
is
possible
to
determine
in
many
of
these
cases
what
the
last
known
address
of
the
creditor
is
and
this
isn't
merely
a
matter
of
the
practical
application
of
a
search
for
those
last
known
addresses.
i
don't
think
that
the
question
of
escheat
should
depend
upon
whether
or
not
a
particular
debtor
keeps
adequate
records.
mr.
julius
greenfield
they
are
in
minnesota,
sir.
mr.
julius
greenfield
yes
sir.
mr.
julius
greenfield
pardon.
mr.
julius
greenfield
well,
i
think
this
is
a
matter
of
a
spatial
question.
if
we
were
faced
with
a
necessity
of
proving
that
they
were
no
last
known
addresses
in
a
particular
group
of
cases
then
we
feel
that
we
should
bear
that
burden,
but
we
also
feel
that
the
other
state
should
bear
their
burden
of
proving
that
they
are
last
known
addresses
in
particular
states.
mr.
julius
greenfield
this
is
one
of
the
offices
maintained
by
western
union
for
that
purpose.
mr.
julius
greenfield
i
suppose.
that
probably
is
one
of
the
reasons.
i
would
like
to
mr.
chief
justice
to
refer
to
the
jurisdictional
statement
because
reference
has
been
made
by
pennsylvania
to
the
fact
that
there
is
some
kind
of
presumption
that's
available
that
the
state
of
last
known
address
follows
the
state
of
office
of
origin,
and
this
is
the
jurisdictional
statement
which
was
made
by
western
union
in
the
western
union
against
the
pennsylvania
case.
“even
as
to
payees,
who
received
drafts
at
offices
of
the
appellant
in
pennsylvania,
there
is
no
showing
and
there
can
be
no
basis
for
presuming
that
they
were
residents
of
pennsylvania
at
a
time
of
receipt.”
mr.
julius
greenfield
the
significance
of
the
point
i
made
was
this
judge
that
pennsylvania
is
relying
upon
only
presumption
of
the
state
of
origin
being
the
state
of
last
known
address.
the
point
i
am
making
is
that
there
is
no
proof
in
this
record,
there
is
no
basis
for
the
presumption
in
this
record,
before
this
court
for
such
a
determination.
and
the
only
thing
that
you
have
to
rely
upon
is
something
that
is
familiarly
referred
to
as
logic
in
the
situation.
we
must
realize
that
we're
dealing
with
a
mobile
society
and
i
am
sure,
i
know
that
you
are
fully
aware
of
that,
and
that
people
do
not
always
or
a
customarily
reside
in
the
place
where
they
buy
money
orders.
mr.
julius
greenfield
there
is
--
there
is
that
possibility,
but
i
simply
point
out
to
you
judge
that
on
the
state
of
the
record
before
this
court,
there
is
no
basis
for
the
presumption
urged
by
pennsylvania.
mr.
julius
greenfield
no
sir,
i
do
not
think
it
is
beyond
your
reach.
mr.
julius
greenfield
i
wouldn't
characterize
it
as
irrational,
but
i
would
say
--
mr.
julius
greenfield
--
that
it
was
unfounded
because
it
was
not
based
upon
sufficient
information.
mr.
julius
greenfield
i
am
not
talking
only
about
the
record
judge,
i
am
saying
that
there
is
nothing
that
we
know
of.
mr.
julius
greenfield
that's
true.
mr.
julius
greenfield
i
don't
know
whether
that
assumption
is
tenable
judge.
mr.
julius
greenfield
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
but
i
think
--
mr.
julius
greenfield
offices
of
western
union
in
new
york?
mr.
julius
greenfield
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
sir.
mr.
julius
greenfield
of
course
there
are,
of
course
there
are.
mr.
julius
greenfield
the
possibility
it
is
that
money
did
not
come
from
new
york
--
mr.
julius
greenfield
well
the
probability
does
exist
but
what
i
was
trying
to
point
out
to
your
honor
is
that
new
york
being
the
largest
commercial
state
in
the
united
states
and
the
most
active
commercial
state
that
this
kind
of
thing
could
emanate
to
a
very
considerable
extent
from
new
york.
mr.
julius
greenfield
i
am
sorry.
mr.
julius
greenfield
that
maybe
so.
mr.
julius
greenfield
my
understanding
is
that
the
amounts
range
is
rather
small
--
mr.
julius
greenfield
five
dollar
level
--
mr.
julius
greenfield
no,
there
isn't,
but
i
understand
that
their
level
would
range
up
to
about
$25
and
perhaps
more.
mr.
julius
greenfield
the
answer
to
that
your
honor
i
think
in
part
at
least
when
referring
to
the
special
master's
report
is
that
the
special
master
found
to
the
contrary.
he
found
that
there
was
no
reasonable
basis
for
this
presumption.
mr.
julius
greenfield
there
was
no
reasonable
basis
for
this
presumption.
mr.
julius
greenfield
no,
i
don't
think
that's
quite
the
way
i
would
put
it.
i
think
that
the
court
has
an
obvious
right
to
recognize
what
it
considers
to
be
the
ordinary
state
effect.
what
i
am
saying
and
what
i
have
continued
to
say
that
in
the
state
of
this
record,
there
is
no
basis
for
that
presumption.
furthermore,
both
of
the
parties,
both
pennsylvania
and
western
union
have
said
in
the
past,
that
there
is
no
basis
for
such
a
determination.
in
texas
against
new
jersey,
the
court
rejected
a
context
test
theory
and
adopted
the
rule
that
is
well
known
to
this
court
and
that
is,
as
to
each
item
of
property,
the
property
should
go
to
the
state
of
last
known
address
of
the
creditor
as
shown
on
the
books
of
the
debtor
cooperation,
and
the
secondary
rule
was
that
the
state
of
domicile
of
the
corporation
would
take
if
that
address
was
not
available.
i
think
something
has
been
made
by
pennsylvania
of
the
fact
that
this
theory
requires
that
there
be
a
last
known
street
address.
i
think
that
the
texas
of
case
does
not
require
any
such
showing,
but
merely
requires
a
showing
that
the
last
known
address
of
the
creditor
was
within
a
particular
state.
mr.
julius
greenfield
this
has
been
defined
by
the
special
master
i
think
satisfactorily
to
everybody
involved
in
the
case.
in
the
case
in
which
a
money
order
is
issued,
the
person
to
whom
it
is
issued
is
the
creditor.
in
the
case
where
a
money
order
is
issued
to
the
payee,
he
is
the
creditor.
in
the
case,
where
a
money
order
is
sent
for
the
benefit
of
a
payee,
but
he
doesn't
pick
it
up,
the
money
order
is
canceled.
provision
is
made
for
the
sender
to
be
notified,
that
he
should
pick
up
the
funds.a
draft
maybe
issued
to
him
under
those
circumstances
in
which
event
he
is
the
creditor.
but
to
answer
your
question
as
concisely
as
i
can,
a
sender
is
the
creditor
unless
a
money
order
has
been
issued
to
the
payee
in
which
event
the
payee
is
the
creditor.
a
reference
was
made
to
special
master's
report
insofar
as
its
requirements
concerning
the
burden
of
proof.
i
would
like
again
to
point
out
that
the
special
master
reported
that
the
creditor's
last
known
address
is
his
conscious
choice
whereas
the
initiation
of
a
transaction
in
a
particular
office
of
origin
might
merely
be
a
matter
of
choice
or
convenience
and
the
special
master
pointed
out
too
that
the
sender
might
have
been
in
that
jurisdiction
for
only
an
hour
or
for
a
day.
i
don’t
think
it’s
necessary
any
longer
to
respond
to
the
contentions
of
florida,
in
view
of
the
fact
they
have
now
joined
the
pennsylvania
position.
but
i
would
point
to
the
fact
that
in
his
conclusion,
the
special
master
determine
that
the
texas
rule
is
a
simple
and
workable
formula
and
that
it
sets
in
easily
administered
standard,
preventing
multiple
claims
and
giving
all
the
parties
a
fixed
and
reliable
rule.
to
adopt
a
rule
of
the
kind
that
is
now
sponsored
by
pennsylvania
and
its
adherence,
it
would
seem
to
us,
brings
us
into
the
kind
of
problem
that
mr.
justice
stewart
referred
to
in
his
two
dissents
in
the
western
union
case
and
in
the
texas
against
new
jersey
case,
that
is
that
those
cases
would
can
cause
more
problems
than
they
solve.
and
the
point
that
i
am
making
by
stating
that
is
that,
if
reliance
is
to
be
had
upon
such
a
thing
as
a
presumption
of
the
office
of
origin
being
the
state
of
last
known
address
then
i
suggest
that
the
court
is
leaving
itself
in
for
determinations
in
every
kind
of
case
in
which
the
factual
situation
differs
from
texas
against
new
jersey.
mr.
julius
greenfield
i
don’t
think
there
would
be
any
problem
with
that.
this
is
a
point
i
was
making
before
judge
that
these
cases
should
not
depend
upon
whether
or
not
a
particular
debtor
keeps
its
records
properly.
mr.
julius
greenfield
i
don’t
think
there
would
be,
because
as
i
have
said
before
we
support
the
special
master's
report
which
says,
give
it
to
the
state
of
last
known
address
of
the
creditor.
mr.
julius
greenfield
as
shown
on
the
creditor's
books.
mr.
julius
greenfield
yes
he
does.
mr.
julius
greenfield
i
don’t
know
whether
that
estimate
is
a
reliable
estimate,
but
as
i
have
said
before
new
york
is
prepared
to
bear
its
burden
in
supporting
its
claim.
mr.
julius
greenfield
i
don’t
know
sir.
i
accept
what
mrs.
wentworth
said.
we
would
suggest
that
in
grafting
upon
the
texas
against
new
jersey
determination
a
new
category
of
state
taking
them,
that
is
when
the
records
of
the
debtor
cooperation
are
inadequately
kept,
a
presumption
should
arise
that
the
state
of
the
last
known
address
is
the
state
of
inception
of
a
transaction.
mr.
julius
greenfield
with
one
possible
variation
of
what
you
have
said
judge,
yes,
i
think
it
is
important
to
point
out
that
our
statue
is
--
mr.
julius
greenfield
--
entirely
an
custody
statute.
mr.
julius
greenfield
yes
sir.
mr.
julius
greenfield
i
don't
follow
what
you
are
saying
judge?
you
say
that
the
address
is
the
address
of
sender
but
you
don’t
have
the
address
of
the
sender.
mr.
julius
greenfield
if
you
accept
that
presumption.
mr.
julius
greenfield
i
think
that
will
be
necessary.
mr.
julius
greenfield
i
think
there
are
several
answers
to
that,
your
honor.
in
the
first
place
our
statute
is
a
pure
custodial
statute,
it
is
never
escheated,
the
property
is
never
escheated,
it
is
aways
available
for
a
claim
by
the
owners
and
we
have
had
a
history
of
considerable
claims
for
refunds
in
many
of
these
situations.
the
point
that
you
are
making
i
assume
is
that
if
the
funds
are
not
claimed,
another
state
can
ultimately
come
in
and
say
this
money
belongs
to
us.
but
this
is
exactly
what
texas
against
new
jersey
said,
texas
against
new
jersey
says
that,
”when
funds
are
paid
to
the
domiciliary
state
in
the
absence
of
a
last
known
address
on
the
books
of
the
debtor
corporation,
it
is
subject
to
reclamation
by
another
state
upon
a
showing
that
the
last
known
address
was
in
that
state.”
mr.
julius
greenfield
as
i
said
before
judge,
i
don't
think
that
it
is
fair
to
characterize
that
as
an
escheat
because
we
have
a
history
of
considerable
amounts
of
claims
made
after
property
has
been
paid
into
our
abandoned
property
funds.
mr.
julius
greenfield
well,
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
the
new
york
state
legislature
from
adopting
such
a
statute,
but
i
would
simply
call
to
your
attention
that
the
preamble
to
our
abandoned
property
law
which
i
believe
was
one
of
the
forerunners
of
all
of
the
abandoned
property
laws
in
this
country
is
that
these
funds
are
to
be
used
for
the
benefit
of
the
public
at
large
while
protecting
the
interests
of
the
persons
to
whom,
who
are
entitled
to
these
funds.
and
i
know
of
no
movement
in
the
state
of
new
york
to
turn
this
statute
into
an
escheat
statute.
i
would
call
to
the
attention
to
the
court
the
fact
as
i
did
before
that
this
court
did
not
close
it's
eyes
to
the
western
union
situation
when
it
determined
texas
against
new
jersey.
indeed
as
i
have
already
noted,
the
court
based
it's
determination
in
texas
that
leave
should
be
granted
to
file
a
complaint
because
it
had
held
in
western
union
against
pennsylvania
that
the
due
process
clause
prevented
any
one
state
from
escheating
a
given
item
of
a
property.
thus
when
the
court
decided
texas
against
new
jersey,
it
had
already
been
confronted
with
the
factual
situations
with
which
we
are
confronted
here
today.
and
accordingly,
it
was
thoroughly
aware
of
those
facts
when
it
formulated
the
unqualified
texas
rule
for
disposition
of
intangibles
of
all
kinds.
as
i
have
indicated
before
the
pennsylvania
assertion
that
the
predominant
right
of
the
state
where
the
transaction
or
purchase
occurred
is
not
really
based
upon
such
statutes
as
the
uniform
disposition
of
unclaimed
property
act
which
as
it's
said
has
been
adopted
by
a
number
of
states
and
i
might
call
to
the
court’s
attention
that
when
an
uniform
act
is
adopted
by
the
various
states,
it
is
uniform
generally
only
to
the
word
uniform.
the
uniform
statute,
the
revised
uniform
disposition
of
unclaimed
property
act
does
not
provide
for
taking
by
a
state
which
is
the
office
of
origin.
it
provides
for
taking
by
a
state
in
which
the
written
instruments
are
issued
and
then
significantly
the
uniform
act
also
provides
that
the
state
in
which
that
act
is
adopted
will
not
claim
the
money
if
another
state
in
which
the
last
known
address
resides,
takes
the
property
and
has
a
reciprocal
provision
with
the
other
state.
if
the
pennsylvania
proposal
is
to
be
considered
then
it
would
seem
to
us
that
other
and
equally
and
perhaps
more
compelling
material
alternative
should
be
considered
by
the
court.
for
example,
and
i
think
this
pointed
up
by
at
least
one
decision
by
this
court,
connecticut
life
insurance
against
moore,
should
you
not
be
considering
such
things
as
the
place
of
resident
of
the
sender
when
he
died.
and
the
place
where
the
sender
was
last
known
to
reside
or
the
place
of
a
proved
later
or
longer
residence
of
the
sender
or
the
state
of
actual
domicile
of
the
sender
or
the
state
of
actual
delivery
of
the
draft
or
the
state
in
which
the
funds
were
maintained
for
satisfaction
of
a
draft
or
the
state
in
which
the
sendee
died
or
the
state
in
which
the
sendee
was
last
known
to
reside
or
the
state
of
a
proved
later
or
longer
residence
of
the
sendee
or
the
state
of
actual
domicile
of
the
sendee.
the
reason
why
i
have
gone
into
this
long
statement
of
the
various
alternatives
is
that
all
of
these
alternatives
were
rejected
by
the
texas
court.
the
context
test
is
not
really
a
workable
test
at
all
and
the
test
that
suggests
that
the
court
should
examine
the
circumstances
surrounding
each
particular
item
of
escheatable
property,
on
it's
particular
facts
and
then
try
to
make
it
difficult
often
quite
subjective
decision
as
to
which
state's
claim
seems
stronger
than
another,
is
it
seems
to
us
intolerable.
you
would
have,
perhaps
hundreds
of
cases
of
this
kind
before
you,
consequently
this
court
should
refuse
to
adopt
the
rule
in
which
results
in
treating
this
subject
on
a
case
by
case
basis
and
we
submit
that
the
rule
adopted
in
texas
against
new
jersey
is
fully
applicable
here
and
that
the
proposed
decree
of
the
special
master
should
be
adopted.
thank
you.
