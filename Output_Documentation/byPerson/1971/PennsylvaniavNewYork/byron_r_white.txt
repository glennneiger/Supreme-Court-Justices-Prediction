you
think
an
(inaudible)
reach
this
judicial
notice?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
it
isn't
(inaudible)
you
think
we
must
take
judicial
notice
–
you
think
it's
reasonable
or
irrational
to
assume
that
--
let's
assume
that
i
said
it
in
my
own
mind
that
i
think
at
least
75%
of
the
cases,
the
sender
will
be
sending
from
his
place
of
his
address,
you
think
that
would
be
an
irrational
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
it's
wrong
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree
with
you
that's
the
way
it
is
in
the
record
that's
true,
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
just
so
intangible
that
there
no
one
can
really
possibly
say
just
from
your
own
experience,
what
percentage
of
circumstances
senders
wouldn't
be
at
home
or
away
from
home?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
that
there
wouldn't
be
argument
about
varying
the
texas
rule
if
western
union
kept
its
record
in
this
case,
so
that
the
address
of
the
sender
was
easily
ascertainable?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
once
(inaudible)
that
just
happened
to
have
kept
its
books
cumulatively
and
the
money
came
in
and
it
actually
made
it
--
had
an
easily
available
form
the
addressed
then
there
wouldn't
be
in
this
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
shown
on
the
creditor’s
book?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
here
the
creditor
does
have
some
books
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
will
cost
couple
of
hundred
thousand
dollars
–-
justice
byron
r.
white
let’s
assume,
you
went
through
western
union's
records
and
found
the
application
for
the
money
order
and
the
sender
gave
his
name
of
course,
but
didn’t
give
any
address.
now
you
say
applying
on
a
prior
rule
that
that's
--
in
that
case,
it
should
escheat
to
new
york?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
–
justice
byron
r.
white
alright
then,
and
anyway
you
would
say
new
york
is
entitled
to
possession
of
the
money?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
seems
to
me
at
that
point,
the
argument
would
have
made
as
much
force
that
when
the
address
isn't
shown
in
the
books
of
the
company,
arguably
you
should
say
the
address
is
at
the
place
of
sender.
the
address
is
the
place
of
the
sender
--
that's
when
the
argument
really
should
come
up.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
books
--
what
you
would
say
is
that
the
address
of
the
--
the
books
of
the
company
does
show
his
address,
when
it
shows
it
specifically
or
it
doesn't
show
it
at
all,
in
the
sense
that
there
is
a
presumption
that
when
he
doesn't
fill
in
the
blank
for
an
address
that
he
lives
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
still
even
if
you
accepted
that
presumption
it
might
be
that
you
should
actually
go
through
the
whole
process
of
looking
at
those
application
of
course?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
have
lets
us
know?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
an
(inaudible)
reach
this
judicial
notice?
justice
byron
r.

well,
if
it
isn't

you
think

must
take
judicial

–
you
