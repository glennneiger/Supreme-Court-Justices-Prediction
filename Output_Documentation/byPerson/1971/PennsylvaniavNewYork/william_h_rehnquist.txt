well,
if
new
york
can
hold
them
indefinitely,
they
don't
need
to
pass
an
escheat
statute,
they
are
getting
the
same
benefit
from
them
as
if
they
had
the
escheat
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
are
getting
interest
on
them
presumably?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
greenfield
in
connection
with
your
reference
to
that
record
in
the
western
union
versus
pennsylvania
case,
even
assuming
that
the
payees
are
very
likely
to
be
away
from
home,
isn't
that
more
likely
perhaps
that
the
senders
are
close
to
homes
than
the
payees?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then
in
effect
we're
to
decide
the
case
without
having
that
knowledge
or
any
basis
for
a
fair
presumption
about
it,
is
that
new
york's
position?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
greenfield,
you
referred
to
the
fact
that
new
york's
an
abandoned
property
custody
statute
rather
than
an
escheat
statute.
as
a
practical
matter
after
a
few
years
have
gone
by
and
there
has
been
no
private
claimant,
isn’t
the
real
battle
between
possible
states
claiming
escheat
rather
than
the
possibility
that
some
unknown
claimant
will
show
up,
so
far
as
a
great
majority
of
the
funds
held
under
new
york
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
new
york
has
custody
of
the
money
and
has
the
benefit
of
a
rule
which
prevents
any
other
state
from
coming
in
and
enjoying
a
superior
right,
new
york
has
pretty
well
got
an
escheat,
hasn’t
it,
so
far
as
the
benefit
of
the
money
is
concerned?
