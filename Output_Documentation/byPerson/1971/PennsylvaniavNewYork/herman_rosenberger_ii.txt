mr.
herman
rosenberger
ii
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
of
the
court.
this
is
an
original
action
initiated
by
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
between
the
states
to
determine
a
controversy
as
to
the
application
of
the
law
set
down
in
texas
versus
new
jersey
to
instances
of
intangible
obligations,
whether
the
debtors
records
with
varying
degrees
of
frequency
do
not
indicate
the
identity
or
street
address
of
the
creditor.
with
specific
respect
to
western
union,
this
action
requests
a
declaratory
judgment,
as
to
which
state
should
be
assigned
priority
for
purposes
of
escheating,
or
taking
custody
between
one,
and
one-and-a-half
of
millions
of
dollars
of
unclaimed
debts
arising
from
the
sale
of
intangible,
telegraph
money
orders
on
or
before
december
31,
1962.
inferentially,
this
action
will
govern
instruments
unclaimed
issued
before
and
after
that
date,
with
respect
to
money
orders
sold
by
western
union
and
other
companies
over-the-counters
and
traveler's
checks
issued
by
the
american
express
company
and
other
species
of
bearer
instruments
sold
to
the
public.
pennsylvania
and
the
other
states,
excepting
new
york,
supported
a
rule
which
like
that
in
texas
versus
new
jersey,
will
give
preference
to
the
state
where
the
creditor
is
deemed
to
have
last
resided
and
the
debt
was
payable
as
shown
by
the
debtor's
records.
this
would
be
the
state
where
the
creditor's
right
accrued,
the
state
of
purchase
where
a
draft
has
not
been
issued
to
the
sendee,
or
the
state
of
destination
where
a
draft
was
so
issued,
but
not
negotiated.
such
a
rule
would
not
only
reflect
the
underlying
realties
of
the
transaction
involved,
but
would
be
equitable
to
escheating
states
and
would
distribute
escheats
among
the
states
in
proportion
to
the
commercial
activities
of
its
citizens.
new
york
supports
a
rule
which
on
the
facts
of
the
present
case
would
give
present
preference
to
the
state
of
corporate
domicile
where
the
creditor's
identity
or
street
address
did
not
appear
on
the
debtor's
records,
or
where
it
was
not
feasible
to
determine
the
same.
this
rule
as
applied
to
the
facts
of
this
case
would
result
in
most
of
the
escheatable
claims
flowing
into
new
york's
treasury
due
to
the
accident
of
the
western
union's
incorporation.
and
with
respect
to
traveler's
checks
and
over-the-counter
money
orders,
would
give
new
york
exclusively
the
millions
of
dollars
of
escheatable
funds
involved.
the
differing
positions
of
the
parties
to
this
action
are
reflected
in
their
statutes.
the
statutes
of
all
parties
to
the
case,
excepting
new
york,
are
basically
patterned
after
the
uniform
disposition
of
unclaimed
property
act,
which
allows
for
the
custodial
taking
of
property
held
or
owing
in
the
particular
jurisdiction.
the
statute
of
the
state
of
new
york
is
divided
into
escheatable
occurrences,
occurring
before
and
after
1958.
before
1958,
new
york
maintains
that
it
is
entitled
to
take
all
obligations
regardless
as
to
where
the
rights
were
accrued
of
the
holder
which
is
incorporated
in
the
state
of
new
york.
with
respect
to
items
after
1958,
new
york
statute
provides
for
custody
of
new
york,
where
the
creditor's
address
is
not
on
the
debtor's
records.
however,
with
respect
to
corporations
incorporated
outside
of
new
york,
section
c
of
that
particular
statute
provides
that
new
york
would
take
where
the
obligation
was
incurred
in
the
state
of
new
york.
in
other
words,
new
york
essentially
has
it
both
ways.
the
states
of
pennsylvania,
california,
north
carolina,
and
indiana
have
explicitly
provided
in
their
statutes
for
a
presumption
that
where
the
creditor's
address
does
not
appear
on
the
records
of
the
debtor
with
respect
to
money
orders
and
traveler's
checks,
that,
that
address
will
be
deemed
to
be
in
the
state
of
sale.
16
states,
including
the
four
that
i
just
mentioned,
implicitly
provide
for
the
same
presumption
by
adopting
a
state
of
sale
test
with
respect
to
money
orders
and
traveler's
checks.
and
the
revised
uniform
disposition
of
unclaimed
property
act
which
was
passed
in
1966
and
adopted
or
approved
by
the
american
bar
association
in
the
same
year
also
provides
for
a
state
of
sale
test
with
respect
to
this
particular
class
of
property.
a
further
reason
for
the
institution
of
this
action
is
that
western
union's
records
reflect
two
possible
creditors.
the
sender
and
the
sendee
of
a
telegraph
money
order,
but
do
not
to
denominate
either
as
such.
the
special
master
found
that
the
creditor
in
all
instances
save
where
a
draft
is
issued
to
sendee
is
the
purchaser
and
with
this
finding
all
parties
agree.
the
master
further
found
that
any
rule
should
be
applicable
to
all
involved
transactions
regardless
of
their
date
of
origin
before
1958
or
after
1958
and
with
this
no
party
has
taken
as
exception.
insofar
as
the
rule
proposed
by
the
special
master
and
supported
by
new
york
fails
to
take
into
accounts
the
characteristics
which
distinguished
the
transactions
involved
in
the
present
case
from
those
considered
in
texas
versus
new
jersey.
all
the
states
to
this
litigation,
save
new
york,
vigorously
take
exception
to
his
report.
in
deciding
this
case,
the
court
is
bound
by
neither
statute
or
precedent
save
its
decision
in
texas
versus
new
jersey
which
was
the
first
which
involved
such
a
controversy
between
the
states.
pennsylvania's
position
today
is
two-fold.
first,
that
in
texas
versus
new
jersey,
the
court
was
basically
concerned
with
the
state
which
should
be
given
priority
for
purposes
of
escheat
and
within
that
context
the
word
'address'
refers
to
the
state
in
which
the
creditor
is
deemed
to
reside
and
not
his
street
address
and
this
is
essentially
a
matter
of
semantical
interpretation.
secondly,
we
would
urge
the
court
that
if
in
fact
address
did
mean
street
address
in
the
context
of
texas
versus
new
jersey,
then
that
rule
should
be
modified
to
fit
the
distinctive
circumstances
concerning
the
sort
of
transaction
which
we
are
involved
with
in
a
money
order
situation.
now
with
respect
to
the
first
point,
the
court
specifically
said
in
texas
versus
new
jersey
that
it
was
not
concerned
with
technical
concepts
of
domicile
and
residence
in
determining
an
interstate
controversy.
western
union's
records
and
those
of
other
affected
enterprises
always
show
the
location
and
the
state
where
its
escheatable
obligations
were
purchased,
but
in
many
instances
they
do
not
show
the
creditor's
identity
or
street
address.
even
in
those
instances
where
applications,
retained
by
western
union,
do
show
identity
and
street
address,
the
cost
of
surveying
and
reporting
the
information
would
be
prohibitive
in
terms
of
the
funds
involved
and
even
new
york
argues
that
it
is
not
feasible
to
do
so.
as
far
as
over-the-counter
money
orders
and
traveler's
checks
are
concerned,
such
records
are
never
maintained
as
they
are
not
required
by
the
business.
now,
the
states
that
have
adopted
the
state
of
sale
test
with
respect
to
money
orders
and
traveler's
checks
and
the
four
states,
california,
pennsylvania,
north
carolina,
and
indiana
which
have
a
presumption
right
in
their
statute
that
for
purposes
of
this
situation
where
there
is
no
address,
it
will
be
presumed
that
the
purchaser
of
the
obligation
resides
in
the
state
of
purchase.
we
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
to
uphold
or
to
determine
that
in
fact
there
was
no
rational
basis
for
this
presumption
to
overturn
those
statutes
and
uniform
act
as
suggested
by
new
york,
would
be
to
destroy
that
presumption
without
any
evidence
on
the
record
that
in
fact
it
is
an
invalid
presumption.
now,
in
fact
pennsylvania
offered
to
the
special
master
a
1963
survey
conducted
by
western
union
of
all
escheatable
items
or
unclaimed
items,
which
total
2,951
in
that
particular
year.
in
1,740
items,
the
address
of
the
sender
was
in
the
same
state
as
the
state
in
which
the
application
originated.
in
1,066
of
the
items
or
in
more
than
one
third,
thirty-three
and
one-third
percent,
there
was
no
address
given
on
the
application
form;
the
sender
had
not
filled
in
his
application.
on
145
items,
the
address
of
the
sender
was
in
a
different
state
than
where
the
application
originated.
thus,
in
those
items,
the
1,740
items,
where
in
fact
there
was
an
address,
in
93%
of
the
cases
of
the
address
of
the
purchaser
and
the
state
in
which
investigation
indicated
that
he
resided,
coincided.
now
the
special
master
rejects
this
survey
and
its
reports
sustaining
new
york's
objection
that
one,
it
was
not
properly
authenticated;
secondly,
it
is
irrelevant,
because
it
pertains
to
a
survey
that
was
done
one
year
after
the
last
year
involved
in
pennsylvania's
complaint.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
for
this
item
of
the
secondary
evidence
that
this
survey
was
as
revealing,
as
authenticated,
and
as
relevant
as
the
survey
mentioned
in
the
stipulation
between
the
parties
and
in
the
facts
in
that
stipulation
several
of
which
involves
years
prior
to
1961.
but
even
if
in
fact
the
court
does
not
accept
this
survey
which
has
been
submitted
to
the
court
with
the
other
papers
by
the
special
master,
the
court
can
take
judicial
notice
that
the
presumption
of
the
states
which
have
the
state
of
sale
test,
coincides
with
everyday
experience.
that
is
particularly
with
respect
to
money
orders
which
are
purchased
in
grocery
stores
and
banks
etcetera,
people
tend
to
purchase
these
items,
these
convenience
items
near
where
they
live
and
do
not
cross
interstate
lines.
the
presumption
in
any
event
is
embodied
in
the
statutes
adopted
by
the
respective
states
and
there
is
no
evidence
on
the
record
or
in
reason
to
indicate
that,
that
presumption
is
invalid.
now
as
i
have
already
submitted
to
the
court,
in
texas
versus
new
jersey,
the
court
said
it
was
not
concerned
with
logic.
the
result
in
that
decision
was
not
required
either
by
precedent,
statute,
the
constitution,
or
logic
and
the
use
the
word
'logic'
by
mr.
justice
black
was
a
concerted
one,
because
new
jersey
which
championed
the
corporate
domicile
rule
in
that
case
had
argued
in
its
briefs
and
argument
to
the
court
that
it
was
totally
illogical
to
assume
that
a
last
address
shown
on
sun
oil's
records
which
could
be
up
to
40-year,
which
could
have
been
placed
on
those
records
up
to
40
years
previously
and
to
which
their
drafts
had
been
mailed
and
returned.
it
was
totally
illogical
to
assume
that
the
residence
of
the
purchaser
–
excuse
me,
the
creditor
and
his
address
coincided
and
the
court
said,
we
are
not
concerned
with
the
logic
in
this
situation.
what
we
are
concerned
with
is
a
rule
that
will
distribute
these
funds
equitably
among
the
states
which
have
power
to
escheat
or
to
take
custody.
new
york
has
adopted
the
same
presumption
urged
by
pennsylvania
and
the
other
states
when
it
suits
its
purposes.
as
i
have
already
advised
the
court
with
respect
of
their
abandoned
property
act,
with
respect
to
these
institutions
which
are
incorporated
outside
of
new
york
and
which
issue
obligations
in
new
york,
new
york
provides
for
a
custody
in
that
state,
when
those
obligations
were
issued
in
new
york
state.
and
presently
the
department
of
audits
and
control
in
new
york
has
presented
to
the
legislature
and
it's
up
for
final
reading
at
this
time,
a
bill
that
would
provide
for
state
of
new
york
in
the
case
of
securities
which
have
been
sold
in
new
york
without
reference
to
any
last
known
address
of
the
creditor
or
in
fact
where
there
is
no
last
known
address,
but
without
reference
to
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
broker
is
incorporated
in
new
york
or
not.
secondly,
even
if
the
court
holds
that
the
last
known
address
rule
stated
in
texas
versus
new
jersey
referred
to
street
address
and
was
not
simply
a
shorthand
for
determining
that
state
which
would
be
given
priority
in
the
specific
instance,
the
facts
of
the
underlying
classes
of
transactions
in
the
instant
case
justify
modification
of
the
rule
to
fit
the
present
factual
situation.
and
it
is
our
contention
that
the
transactions
involved
with
respect
to
the
western
union
money
orders,
with
respect
to
over-the-counter
money
orders
and
traveler's
express
–
traveler's
checks
involve
a
distinction
between
those
obligations
which
were
considered
by
the
court
in
texas
versus
new
jersey.
the
distinction
is
between
a
service
purchasing
corporation
or
a
service
purchasing
enterprise
which
was
involved
with
the
sun
oil
company
which
purchased
services
from
its
workers,
from
its
investors,
from
its
lessors
etcetera
and
a
service
selling
enterprise.
in
this
particular
case
we
are
dealing
with
an
enterprise,
the
western
union
telegraph
company
which
sells
services
to
the
public
at
large.
the
service
is
the
transmitting
and
the
delivery
of
these
money
orders.
now
in
the
former
situation
the
creditor
ordinarily
maintains
records
–
the
debtor
ordinarily
maintains
the
records
of
his
creditor's
last
known
address.
he
does
so,
number
one,
because
the
creditor
services
are
necessary
for
the
successful
functioning
of
the
corporation,
and
secondly
because
he
is
dealing
with
a
limited
number
of
creditors
or
classes
of
creditors.
in
this
second
situation
when
we
are
dealing
with
western
union
and
other
issuers
of
these
bearer
instruments,
we
are
dealing
with
a
situation
of
a
enterprise
that
is
dealing
with
the
public
at
large,
where
it
is
selling
services
and
that
it
in
only
a
very
few
time
did
those
services
failed
to
be
performed.
there
is
no
reason
for
the
enterprise
to
maintain
records
of
the
address
of
his
creditors
and
in
fact
in
the
particular
situation
if
they
were
required
to
do
so,
it
would
quite
possibly
increase
the
cost
of
their
service.
the
modification
of
the
creditor
state
rule
which
we
purpose,
which
would
either
interpret
the
word
address
in
texas
versus
new
jersey
to
simply
refer
to
the
location
and
state
of
purchase
because
in
each
of
the
instances
here
that
is
reflected
in
western
union's
records
or
would
apply
texas
versus
new
jersey
to
the
facts
of
this
particular
case
where
in
many
instances
there
is
no
such
a
record.
our
purposed
modification
would
not
have
affected
the
outcome
of
that
state
--
of
that
case
because
in
that
case
sun
oil
retained
records
in
an
overwhelming
number
of
cases.
therefore,
it
would
not
affect
the
integrity
of
that
decision.
the
proposals
of
pennsylvania
in
all
the
other
states,
save
new
york,
serves
the
three
overriding
considerations
which
the
court
gave
in
texas
versus
new
jersey.
number
one,
it
is
equitable.
it
distributes
escheats
to
the
states
in
proportion
to
the
commercial
activities
of
its
citizens.
it
would
be
acceptable
to
the
great
majority
of
states
involved,
and
it
is
also
equitable
to
the
state
of
new
york,
because
the
state
of
new
york
will
still
receive
the
power
to
--
the
preference
to
take
custody
for
items
originating
in
that
jurisdiction
and
also
the
fourteen
jurisdictions
which
do
not
have
escheat
statutes.
secondly,
it
is
a
result
which
would
encourage
the
ease
of
administration
and
application
of
escheat
statutes.
it
would
not
require
burdens
of
record
keeping.
it
would
not
require
burdens
of
litigation
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
state
requirements
were
reasonable
or
not
and
third
it
is
rule
which
will
foster
certainty,
because
it
involved
--
mr.
herman
rosenberger
ii
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
in
fact,
the
test
that
i
am
discussing
is
that
the
escheat
would
be
given
to
the
state
where
the
creditor's
right
was
accrued,
namely
the
state
of
issue
in
all
cases
except
where
a
draft
was
issued
in
the
receiving
state.
western
union's
records,
their
ledger
record
show
in
each
instance
the
location
in
state
of
purchase
and
their
records
also
show
where
in
fact
drafts
have
been
issued,
so
that
i
do
not
believe
it
would
require
anything
significant
to
determine.
finally,
it
would
foster
certainty
because
there
are
no
factual
issues
left
to
resolve.
if
the
court
adopts
the
master's
report,
which
essentially
restates
the
rule
of
texas
versus
new
jersey
without
a
consideration
of
a
underlying
circumstances
in
this
particular
case,
i
would
suggest
that
there
might
be
further
litigation
with
respect
to
what
the
word
'address'
means,
with
respect
to
the
questions
involved
in
the
decree
of
texas
versus
new
jersey
and
this
was
another
indication
that
the
court
in
texas
versus
new
jersey
was
loath
to
allow
a
state
to
escheat
these
items
simply
on
the
accent
of
incorporation.
as
the
court
will
recall
in
the
decree
in
that
case,
the
court
allowed
primarily
escheats
to
the
creditor's
state
and
again
i
am
talking
about
escheat
or
custodial
taking.
to
the
extent
of
that
state
powers
under
its
own
laws
to
escheat
or
take
custodially,
the
court
was
not
concerned
with
the
power
of
the
state
to
escheat;
the
question
was
priorities
between
the
state.
in
that
taking
of
course
there
were
no
if
and
buts
or
wherefores.
however,
where
there
was
no
address
of
the
person
entitled
thereto
shown
on
the
books
and
records
and
i
would
–
and
we
are
suggesting
as
a
substitution,
where
there
is
no
indication
on
the
books
and
records
of
the
state
in
which
the
creditors
right
was
incurred,
then
it
was
given
and
only
then,
and
of
course
the
court
specified
that
they
presume
this
situation
would
arise
infrequently,
with
relative
infrequency,
then
and
only
then
was
it
a
given
to
the
state
of
sun
oil's
incorporation,
subject
to
the
right
of
any
other
state
to
recover
the
property
upon
proof
that
the
last
known
address
of
the
creditor
was
in
that
state
and
of
course,
there
the
proof
was
not
limited
to
the
records
of
data
corporation.
and
then
finally
where
the
creditor's
state
did
not
even
have
an
escheat
statute
on
its
books,
it
was
still
allowed
to
recover
from
state
of
incorporation
at
any
time
it
subsequently
passed
such
an
escheat
statute.
and
new
jersey
filed
a
motion
for
the
court
to
modify
that
decree,
urged
that
it
would
result
in
uncertainty
and
the
court
denied
the
motion.
so
in
conclusion
i
suggest
that
the
position
presented
by
pennsylvania
here
is
one
that
will
serve
the
spirit
and
the
intention
of
the
court
in
texas
versus
new
jersey
and
it
is
equitable
and
it
will
be
acceptable
by
the
great
majority
of
the
states.
i
challenge
the
state
of
new
york
to
show
this
court
how
it's
position,
in
any
way,
is
equitable
to
its
sister
states.
thank
you,
i
reserve
some
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
herman
rosenberger
ii
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
i'll
try
not
to
burden
you
with
too
much
additional
time.
first
of
all,
mr.
greenfield
indicated
that
the
special
master
had
found
that
there
was
no
rational
basis
for
the
presumption
which
has
been
incorporated
in
the
statutes
of
four
states
and
is
implicitly
incorporated
in
the
uniform
disposition
of
unclaimed
property
act.
in
fact
at
page
18
pf
his
report,
the
master
found
–
the
master
stated
and
i
quote,
“frequently,
perhaps
usually
this
office
and
his
domicile
would
coincide,”
but
it
is
clear
that
money
orders
must
frequently
be
brought
away
from
home.
i
think,
that
the
record
of
a
1963
survey
which
is
before
the
court,
the
court
can
consider
that,
shows
that
in
fact
it
is
much
more
than
usually
that
the
two
offices
coincide
and
that
this
comports
with
the
common
experience.
with
respect
to
the
application
forms,
mr.
greenfield
indicated
that
these
application
forms
are
available.
stipulation
indicates
or
contains
as
an
exhibit
a
letter
from
western
union
in
which
it
is
stated
that
these
application
forms
range
from
poor
to
fair
condition
and
as
the
1963
survey
indicated
in
at
least
one-third
of
the
cases,
no
address
is
given
on
the
application
forms.
at
exhibit
16
to
the
stipulation,
there
is
a
listing
of
the
records
which
are
available
by
division
and
generally
the
court
will
find
that
there
is
a
variance
of
between
20
and
30
years
concerning
to
the
distance
to
which
the
ledger
records
go
back
to
and
the
distance
to
which
the
application
forms
are
available.
with
particular
respect
to
the
eastern
division
of
western
union
which
would
include
pennsylvania,
connecticut,
new
york,
the
ledger
records
are
available
from
january
of
1916,
the
application
forms
are
available
from
december
of
1941
so
there
will
be
--
if
in
fact
we
are
forced
to
try
to
determine
the
last
known
address,
in
each
of
these
situations,
there
will
be
a
considerable
number
of
situations
where
it
will
not
be
possible
to
do
so
and
in
any
event
it
will
require
needless
expense
on
the
part
of
the
states
and
on
the
part
of
western
union.
arizona,
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
also
abandoned
it's
position
as
it
advised
the
parties
by
letter
which
was
circulated
to
all
the
parties.
it
joins
florida
and
the
other
states.
mr.
herman
rosenberger
ii
no,
they
have
not
officially
advised
the
court.
new
york
stressed
the
question,
the
preamble
of
it's
custodial
taken
statute
which
says
that
these
funds
shall
be
used
for
the
public
good
and
concern.
the
question,
the
equitable
question
here
is,
why
should
these
funds
originating
from
all
over
the
country
and
assorted
jurisdictions
be
used
for
the
public
good
of
the
state
of
new
york?
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
as
mr.
jackson
stated,
in
the
connecticut
insurance
company
case,
it's
a
modern
reality
that
the
courts,
that
these
various
states
attempt
to
take
custodies
of
these
funds
not
simply
as
conservator,
although
this
is
certainly
a
valid
purpose
to
conserve
property
that
maybe
due
its
citizens,
but
also
is
a
source
of
public
revenue
and
the
court
very
realistically
treated
that
matter
in
texas
versus
new
jersey
in
devising
the
rule
which
would
equitably
distribute
these
moneys
across
the
country.
it
is
pennsylvania’s
position
and
new
york
to
the
contrary
where
they
say
there
is
a
hundred
of
possible
situations
where
we
could
argue
some
variance
from
texas
versus
new
jersey.
i
still
believe
there
are
only
two
basic
situations
and
that
is
where
the
creditor,
ordinarily
for
commercial
reasons,
keeps
the
address
on
his
records
and
in
the
present
situation,
when
we
are
dealing
with
issuers
of
bearer
obligations,
where
there
is
absolutely
no
reason
and
the
cost
would
be
great
if
not
prohibitive
to
maintain
such
records.
because
of
that,
because
of
the
fact
that
there
is
no
equity
in
new
york’s
position
that
such
a
adoption
of
the
master’s
report
in
that
respect
could
not
be
acceptable
to
the
great
majority
of
the
states.
i
urge
the
court
to
find
consistently
with
the
position
that
the
state
of
last
known
address
as
shown
by
the
records
and
that
would
be
the
state
and
new
york
has
agreed
that
texas
versus
new
jersey
only
required
some
indicia
which
would
show
the
state
and
this
indicia
is
shown
by
western
union’s
ledger
records
that,
that
state
would
take
in
all
instances
except
where
a
draft
has
been
issued
to
a
sendee
in
which
situation
the
sendee
state
would
take.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
herman
rosenberger
ii
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
of
the
court.
this
is
an
original
action
initiated
by
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
between
the
states
to
determine
a
controversy
as
to
the
application
of
the
law
set
down
in
texas
versus
new
jersey
to
instances
of
intangible
obligations,
whether
the
debtors
records
with
varying
degrees
of
frequency
do
not
indicate
the
identity
or
street
address
of
the
creditor.
with
specific
respect
to
western
union,
this
action
requests
a
declaratory
judgment,
as
to
which
state
should
be
assigned
priority
for
purposes
of
escheating,
or
taking
custody
between
one,
and
one-and-a-half
of
millions
of
dollars
of
unclaimed
debts
arising
from
the
sale
of
intangible,
telegraph
money
orders
on
or
before
december
31,
1962.
inferentially,
this
action
will
govern
instruments
unclaimed
issued
before
and
after
that
date,
with
respect
to
money
orders
sold
by
western
union
and
other
companies
over-the-counters
and
traveler's
checks
issued
by
the
american
express
company
and
other
species
of
bearer
instruments
sold
to
the
public.
pennsylvania
and
the
other
states,
excepting
new
york,
supported
a
rule
which
like
that
in
texas
versus
new
jersey,
will
give
preference
to
the
state
where
the
creditor
is
deemed
to
have
last
resided
and
the
debt
was
payable
as
shown
by
the
debtor's
records.
this
would
be
the
state
where
the
creditor's
right
accrued,
the
state
of
purchase
where
a
draft
has
not
been
issued
to
the
sendee,
or
the
state
of
destination
where
a
draft
was
so
issued,
but
not
negotiated.
such
a
rule
would
not
only
reflect
the
underlying
realties
of
the
transaction
involved,
but
would
be
equitable
to
escheating
states
and
would
distribute
escheats
among
the
states
in
proportion
to
the
commercial
activities
of
its
citizens.
new
york
supports
a
rule
which
on
the
facts
of
the
present
case
would
give
present
preference
to
the
state
of
corporate
domicile
where
the
creditor's
identity
or
street
address
did
not
appear
on
the
debtor's
records,
or
where
it
was
not
feasible
to
determine
the
same.
this
rule
as
applied
to
the
facts
of
this
case
would
result
in
most
of
the
escheatable
claims
flowing
into
new
york's
treasury
due
to
the
accident
of
the
western
union's
incorporation.
and
with
respect
to
traveler's
checks
and
over-the-counter
money
orders,
would
give
new
york
exclusively
the
millions
of
dollars
of
escheatable
funds
involved.
the
differing
positions
of
the
parties
to
this
action
are
reflected
in
their
statutes.
the
statutes
of
all
parties
to
the
case,
excepting
new
york,
are
basically
patterned
after
the
uniform
disposition
of
unclaimed
property
act,
which
allows
for
the
custodial
taking
of
property
held
or
owing
in
the
particular
jurisdiction.
the
statute
of
the
state
of
new
york
is
divided
into
escheatable
occurrences,
occurring
before
and
after
1958.
before
1958,
new
york
maintains
that
it
is
entitled
to
take
all
obligations
regardless
as
to
where
the
rights
were
accrued
of
the
holder
which
is
incorporated
in
the
state
of
new
york.
with
respect
to
items
after
1958,
new
york
statute
provides
for
custody
of
new
york,
where
the
creditor's
address
is
not
on
the
debtor's
records.
however,
with
respect
to
corporations
incorporated
outside
of
new
york,
section
c
of
that
particular
statute
provides
that
new
york
would
take
where
the
obligation
was
incurred
in
the
state
of
new
york.
in
other
words,
new
york
essentially
has
it
both
ways.
the
states
of
pennsylvania,
california,
north
carolina,
and
indiana
have
explicitly
provided
in
their
statutes
for
a
presumption
that
where
the
creditor's
address
does
not
appear
on
the
records
of
the
debtor
with
respect
to
money
orders
and
traveler's
checks,
that,
that
address
will
be
deemed
to
be
in
the
state
of
sale.
16
states,
including
the
four
that
i
just
mentioned,
implicitly
provide
for
the
same
presumption
by
adopting
a
state
of
sale
test
with
respect
to
money
orders
and
traveler's
checks.
and
the
revised
uniform
disposition
of
unclaimed
property
act
which
was
passed
in
1966
and
adopted
or
approved
by
the
american
bar
association
in
the
same
year
also
provides
for
a
state
of
sale
test
with
respect
to
this
particular
class
of
property.
a
further
reason
for
the
institution
of
this
action
is
that
western
union's
records
reflect
two
possible
creditors.
the
sender
and
the
sendee
of
a
telegraph
money
order,
but
do
not
to
denominate
either
as
such.
the
special
master
found
that
the
creditor
in
all
instances
save
where
a
draft
is
issued
to
sendee
is
the
purchaser
and
with
this
finding
all
parties
agree.
the
master
further
found
that
any
rule
should
be
applicable
to
all
involved
transactions
regardless
of
their
date
of
origin
before
1958
or
after
1958
and
with
this
no
party
has
taken
as
exception.
insofar
as
the
rule
proposed
by
the
special
master
and
supported
by
new
york
fails
to
take
into
accounts
the
characteristics
which
distinguished
the
transactions
involved
in
the
present
case
from
those
considered
in
texas
versus
new
jersey.
all
the
states
to
this
litigation,
save
new
york,
vigorously
take
exception
to
his
report.
in
deciding
this
case,
the
court
is
bound
by
neither
statute
or
precedent
save
its
decision
in
texas
versus
new
jersey
which
was
the
first
which
involved
such
a
controversy
between
the
states.
pennsylvania's
position
today
is
two-fold.
first,
that
in
texas
versus
new
jersey,
the
court
was
basically
concerned
with
the
state
which
should
be
given
priority
for
purposes
of
escheat
and
within
that
context
the
word
'address'
refers
to
the
state
in
which
the
creditor
is
deemed
to
reside
and
not
his
street
address
and
this
is
essentially
a
matter
of
semantical
interpretation.
secondly,
we
would
urge
the
court
that
if
in
fact
address
did
mean
street
address
in
the
context
of
texas
versus
new
jersey,
then
that
rule
should
be
modified
to
fit
the
distinctive
circumstances
concerning
the
sort
of
transaction
which
we
are
involved
with
in
a
money
order
situation.
now
with
respect
to
the
first
point,
the
court
specifically
said
in
texas
versus
new
jersey
that
it
was
not
concerned
with
technical
concepts
of
domicile
and
residence
in
determining
an
interstate
controversy.
western
union's
records
and
those
of
other
affected
enterprises
always
show
the
location
and
the
state
where
its
escheatable
obligations
were
purchased,
but
in
many
instances
they
do
not
show
the
creditor's
identity
or
street
address.
even
in
those
instances
where
applications,
retained
by
western
union,
do
show
identity
and
street
address,
the
cost
of
surveying
and
reporting
the
information
would
be
prohibitive
in
terms
of
the
funds
involved
and
even
new
york
argues
that
it
is
not
feasible
to
do
so.
as
far
as
over-the-counter
money
orders
and
traveler's
checks
are
concerned,
such
records
are
never
maintained
as
they
are
not
required
by
the
business.
now,
the
states
that
have
adopted
the
state
of
sale
test
with
respect
to
money
orders
and
traveler's
checks
and
the
four
states,
california,
pennsylvania,
north
carolina,
and
indiana
which
have
a
presumption
right
in
their
statute
that
for
purposes
of
this
situation
where
there
is
no
address,
it
will
be
presumed
that
the
purchaser
of
the
obligation
resides
in
the
state
of
purchase.
we
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
to
uphold
or
to
determine
that
in
fact
there
was
no
rational
basis
for
this
presumption
to
overturn
those
statutes
and
uniform
act
as
suggested
by
new
york,
would
be
to
destroy
that
presumption
without
any
evidence
on
the
record
that
in
fact
it
is
an
invalid
presumption.
now,
in
fact
pennsylvania
offered
to
the
special
master
a
1963
survey
conducted
by
western
union
of
all
escheatable
items
or
unclaimed
items,
which
total
2,951
in
that
particular
year.
in
1,740
items,
the
address
of
the
sender
was
in
the
same
state
as
the
state
in
which
the
application
originated.
in
1,066
of
the
items
or
in
more
than
one
third,
thirty-three
and
one-third
percent,
there
was
no
address
given
on
the
application
form;
the
sender
had
not
filled
in
his
application.
on
145
items,
the
address
of
the
sender
was
in
a
different
state
than
where
the
application
originated.
thus,
in
those
items,
the
1,740
items,
where
in
fact
there
was
an
address,
in
93%
of
the
cases
of
the
address
of
the
purchaser
and
the
state
in
which
investigation
indicated
that
he
resided,
coincided.
now
the
special
master
rejects
this
survey
and
its
reports
sustaining
new
york's
objection
that
one,
it
was
not
properly
authenticated;
secondly,
it
is
irrelevant,
because
it
pertains
to
a
survey
that
was
done
one
year
after
the
last
year
involved
in
pennsylvania's
complaint.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
for
this
item
of
the
secondary
evidence
that
this
survey
was
as
revealing,
as
authenticated,
and
as
relevant
as
the
survey
mentioned
in
the
stipulation
between
the
parties
and
in
the
facts
in
that
stipulation
several
of
which
involves
years
prior
to
1961.
but
even
if
in
fact
the
court
does
not
accept
this
survey
which
has
been
submitted
to
the
court
with
the
other
papers
by
the
special
master,
the
court
can
take
judicial
notice
that
the
presumption
of
the
states
which
have
the
state
of
sale
test,
coincides
with
everyday
experience.
that
is
particularly
with
respect
to
money
orders
which
are
purchased
in
grocery
stores
and
banks
etcetera,
people
tend
to
purchase
these
items,
these
convenience
items
near
where
they
live
and
do
not
cross
interstate
lines.
the
presumption
in
any
event
is
embodied
in
the
statutes
adopted
by
the
respective
states
and
there
is
no
evidence
on
the
record
or
in
reason
to
indicate
that,
that
presumption
is
invalid.
now
as
i
have
already
submitted
to
the
court,
in
texas
versus
new
jersey,
the
court
said
it
was
not
concerned
with
logic.
the
result
in
that
decision
was
not
required
either
by
precedent,
statute,
the
constitution,
or
logic
and
the
use
the
word
'logic'
by
mr.
justice
black
was
a
concerted
one,
because
new
jersey
which
championed
the
corporate
domicile
rule
in
that
case
had
argued
in
its
briefs
and
argument
to
the
court
that
it
was
totally
illogical
to
assume
that
a
last
address
shown
on
sun
oil's
records
which
could
be
up
to
40-year,
which
could
have
been
placed
on
those
records
up
to
40
years
previously
and
to
which
their
drafts
had
been
mailed
and
returned.
it
was
totally
illogical
to
assume
that
the
residence
of
the
purchaser
–
excuse
me,
the
creditor
and
his
address
coincided
and
the
court
said,
we
are
not
concerned
with
the
logic
in
this
situation.
what
we
are
concerned
with
is
a
rule
that
will
distribute
these
funds
equitably
among
the
states
which
have
power
to
escheat
or
to
take
custody.
new
york
has
adopted
the
same
presumption
urged
by
pennsylvania
and
the
other
states
when
it
suits
its
purposes.
as
i
have
already
advised
the
court
with
respect
of
their
abandoned
property
act,
with
respect
to
these
institutions
which
are
incorporated
outside
of
new
york
and
which
issue
obligations
in
new
york,
new
york
provides
for
a
custody
in
that
state,
when
those
obligations
were
issued
in
new
york
state.
and
presently
the
department
of
audits
and
control
in
new
york
has
presented
to
the
legislature
and
it's
up
for
final
reading
at
this
time,
a
bill
that
would
provide
for
state
of
new
york
in
the
case
of
securities
which
have
been
sold
in
new
york
without
reference
to
any
last
known
address
of
the
creditor
or
in
fact
where
there
is
no
last
known
address,
but
without
reference
to
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
broker
is
incorporated
in
new
york
or
not.
secondly,
even
if
the
court
holds
that
the
last
known
address
rule
stated
in
texas
versus
new
jersey
referred
to
street
address
and
was
not
simply
a
shorthand
for
determining
that
state
which
would
be
given
priority
in
the
specific
instance,
the
facts
of
the
underlying
classes
of
transactions
in
the
instant
case
justify
modification
of
the
rule
to
fit
the
present
factual
situation.
and
it
is
our
contention
that
the
transactions
involved
with
respect
to
the
western
union
money
orders,
with
respect
to
over-the-counter
money
orders
and
traveler's
express
–
traveler's
checks
involve
a
distinction
between
those
obligations
which
were
considered
by
the
court
in
texas
versus
new
jersey.
the
distinction
is
between
a
service
purchasing
corporation
or
a
service
purchasing
enterprise
which
was
involved
with
the
sun
oil
company
which
purchased
services
from
its
workers,
from
its
investors,
from
its
lessors
etcetera
and
a
service
selling
enterprise.
in
this
particular
case
we
are
dealing
with
an
enterprise,
the
western
union
telegraph
company
which
sells
services
to
the
public
at
large.
the
service
is
the
transmitting
and
the
delivery
of
these
money
orders.
now
in
the
former
situation
the
creditor
ordinarily
maintains
records
–
the
debtor
ordinarily
maintains
the
records
of
his
creditor's
last
known
address.
he
does
so,
number
one,
because
the
creditor
services
are
necessary
for
the
successful
functioning
of
the
corporation,
and
secondly
because
he
is
dealing
with
a
limited
number
of
creditors
or
classes
of
creditors.
in
this
second
situation
when
we
are
dealing
with
western
union
and
other
issuers
of
these
bearer
instruments,
we
are
dealing
with
a
situation
of
a
enterprise
that
is
dealing
with
the
public
at
large,
where
it
is
selling
services
and
that
it
in
only
a
very
few
time
did
those
services
failed
to
be
performed.
there
is
no
reason
for
the
enterprise
to
maintain
records
of
the
address
of
his
creditors
and
in
fact
in
the
particular
situation
if
they
were
required
to
do
so,
it
would
quite
possibly
increase
the
cost
of
their
service.
the
modification
of
the
creditor
state
rule
which
we
purpose,
which
would
either
interpret
the
word
address
in
texas
versus
new
jersey
to
simply
refer
to
the
location
and
state
of
purchase
because
in
each
of
the
instances
here
that
is
reflected
in
western
union's
records
or
would
apply
texas
versus
new
jersey
to
the
facts
of
this
particular
case
where
in
many
instances
there
is
no
such
a
record.
our
purposed
modification
would
not
have
affected
the
outcome
of
that
state
--
of
that
case
because
in
that
case
sun
oil
retained
records
in
an
overwhelming
number
of
cases.
therefore,
it
would
not
affect
the
integrity
of
that
decision.
the
proposals
of
pennsylvania
in
all
the
other
states,
save
new
york,
serves
the
three
overriding
considerations
which
the
court
gave
in
texas
versus
new
jersey.
number
one,
it
is
equitable.
it
distributes
escheats
to
the
states
in
proportion
to
the
commercial
activities
of
its
citizens.
it
would
be
acceptable
to
the
great
majority
of
states
involved,
and
it
is
also
equitable
to
the
state
of
new
york,
because
the
state
of
new
york
will
still
receive
the
power
to
--
the
preference
to
take
custody
for
items
originating
in
that
jurisdiction
and
also
the
fourteen
jurisdictions
which
do
not
have
escheat
statutes.
secondly,
it
is
a
result
which
would
encourage
the
ease
of
administration
and
application
of
escheat
statutes.
it
would
not
require
burdens
of
record
keeping.
it
would
not
require
burdens
of
litigation
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
state
requirements
were
reasonable
or
not
and
third
it
is
rule
which
will
foster
certainty,
because
it
involved
--
mr.
herman
rosenberger
ii
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
in
fact,
the
test
that
i
am
discussing
is
that
the
escheat
would
be
given
to
the
state
where
the
creditor's
right
was
accrued,
namely
the
state
of
issue
in
all
cases
except
where
a
draft
was
issued
in
the
receiving
state.
western
union's
records,
their
ledger
record
show
in
each
instance
the
location
in
state
of
purchase
and
their
records
also
show
where
in
fact
drafts
have
been
issued,
so
that
i
do
not
believe
it
would
require
anything
significant
to
determine.
finally,
it
would
foster
certainty
because
there
are
no
factual
issues
left
to
resolve.
if
the
court
adopts
the
master's
report,
which
essentially
restates
the
rule
of
texas
versus
new
jersey
without
a
consideration
of
a
underlying
circumstances
in
this
particular
case,
i
would
suggest
that
there
might
be
further
litigation
with
respect
to
what
the
word
'address'
means,
with
respect
to
the
questions
involved
in
the
decree
of
texas
versus
new
jersey
and
this
was
another
indication
that
the
court
in
texas
versus
new
jersey
was
loath
to
allow
a
state
to
escheat
these
items
simply
on
the
accent
of
incorporation.
as
the
court
will
recall
in
the
decree
in
that
case,
the
court
allowed
primarily
escheats
to
the
creditor's
state
and
again
i
am
talking
about
escheat
or
custodial
taking.
to
the
extent
of
that
state
powers
under
its
own
laws
to
escheat
or
take
custodially,
the
court
was
not
concerned
with
the
power
of
the
state
to
escheat;
the
question
was
priorities
between
the
state.
in
that
taking
of
course
there
were
no
if
and
buts
or
wherefores.
however,
where
there
was
no
address
of
the
person
entitled
thereto
shown
on
the
books
and
records
and
i
would
–
and
we
are
suggesting
as
a
substitution,
where
there
is
no
indication
on
the
books
and
records
of
the
state
in
which
the
creditors
right
was
incurred,
then
it
was
given
and
only
then,
and
of
course
the
court
specified
that
they
presume
this
situation
would
arise
infrequently,
with
relative
infrequency,
then
and
only
then
was
it
a
given
to
the
state
of
sun
oil's
incorporation,
subject
to
the
right
of
any
other
state
to
recover
the
property
upon
proof
that
the
last
known
address
of
the
creditor
was
in
that
state
and
of
course,
there
the
proof
was
not
limited
to
the
records
of
data
corporation.
and
then
finally
where
the
creditor's
state
did
not
even
have
an
escheat
statute
on
its
books,
it
was
still
allowed
to
recover
from
state
of
incorporation
at
any
time
it
subsequently
passed
such
an
escheat
statute.
and
new
jersey
filed
a
motion
for
the
court
to
modify
that
decree,
urged
that
it
would
result
in
uncertainty
and
the
court
denied
the
motion.
so
in
conclusion
i
suggest
that
the
position
presented
by
pennsylvania
here
is
one
that
will
serve
the
spirit
and
the
intention
of
the
court
in
texas
versus
new
jersey
and
it
is
equitable
and
it
will
be
acceptable
by
the
great
majority
of
the
states.
i
challenge
the
state
of
new
york
to
show
this
court
how
it's
position,
in
any
way,
is
equitable
to
its
sister
states.
thank
you,
i
reserve
some
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
herman
rosenberger
ii
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
i'll
try
not
to
burden
you
with
too
much
additional
time.
first
of
all,
mr.
greenfield
indicated
that
the
special
master
had
found
that
there
was
no
rational
basis
for
the
presumption
which
has
been
incorporated
in
the
statutes
of
four
states
and
is
implicitly
incorporated
in
the
uniform
disposition
of
unclaimed
property
act.
in
fact
at
page
18
pf
his
report,
the
master
found
–
the
master
stated
and
i
quote,
“frequently,
perhaps
usually
this
office
and
his
domicile
would
coincide,”
but
it
is
clear
that
money
orders
must
frequently
be
brought
away
from
home.
i
think,
that
the
record
of
a
1963
survey
which
is
before
the
court,
the
court
can
consider
that,
shows
that
in
fact
it
is
much
more
than
usually
that
the
two
offices
coincide
and
that
this
comports
with
the
common
experience.
with
respect
to
the
application
forms,
mr.
greenfield
indicated
that
these
application
forms
are
available.
stipulation
indicates
or
contains
as
an
exhibit
a
letter
from
western
union
in
which
it
is
stated
that
these
application
forms
range
from
poor
to
fair
condition
and
as
the
1963
survey
indicated
in
at
least
one-third
of
the
cases,
no
address
is
given
on
the
application
forms.
at
exhibit
16
to
the
stipulation,
there
is
a
listing
of
the
records
which
are
available
by
division
and
generally
the
court
will
find
that
there
is
a
variance
of
between
20
and
30
years
concerning
to
the
distance
to
which
the
ledger
records
go
back
to
and
the
distance
to
which
the
application
forms
are
available.
with
particular
respect
to
the
eastern
division
of
western
union
which
would
include
pennsylvania,
connecticut,
new
york,
the
ledger
records
are
available
from
january
of
1916,
the
application
forms
are
available
from
december
of
1941
so
there
will
be
--
if
in
fact
we
are
forced
to
try
to
determine
the
last
known
address,
in
each
of
these
situations,
there
will
be
a
considerable
number
of
situations
where
it
will
not
be
possible
to
do
so
and
in
any
event
it
will
require
needless
expense
on
the
part
of
the
states
and
on
the
part
of
western
union.
arizona,
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
also
abandoned
it's
position
as
it
advised
the
parties
by
letter
which
was
circulated
to
all
the
parties.
it
joins
florida
and
the
other
states.
mr.
herman
rosenberger
ii
no,
they
have
not
officially
advised
the
court.
new
york
stressed
the
question,
the
preamble
of
it's
custodial
taken
statute
which
says
that
these
funds
shall
be
used
for
the
public
good
and
concern.
the
question,
the
equitable
question
here
is,
why
should
these
funds
originating
from
all
over
the
country
and
assorted
jurisdictions
be
used
for
the
public
good
of
the
state
of
new
york?
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
as
mr.
jackson
stated,
in
the
connecticut
insurance
company
case,
it's
a
modern
reality
that
the
courts,
that
these
various
states
attempt
to
take
custodies
of
these
funds
not
simply
as
conservator,
although
this
is
certainly
a
valid
purpose
to
conserve
property
that
maybe
due
its
citizens,
but
also
is
a
source
of
public
revenue
and
the
court
very
realistically
treated
that
matter
in
texas
versus
new
jersey
in
devising
the
rule
which
would
equitably
distribute
these
moneys
across
the
country.
it
is
pennsylvania’s
position
and
new
york
to
the
contrary
where
they
say
there
is
a
hundred
of
possible
situations
where
we
could
argue
some
variance
from
texas
versus
new
jersey.
i
still
believe
there
are
only
two
basic
situations
and
that
is
where
the
creditor,
ordinarily
for
commercial
reasons,
keeps
the
address
on
his
records
and
in
the
present
situation,
when
we
are
dealing
with
issuers
of
bearer
obligations,
where
there
is
absolutely
no
reason
and
the
cost
would
be
great
if
not
prohibitive
to
maintain
such
records.
because
of
that,
because
of
the
fact
that
there
is
no
equity
in
new
york’s
position
that
such
a
adoption
of
the
master’s
report
in
that
respect
could
not
be
acceptable
to
the
great
majority
of
the
states.
i
urge
the
court
to
find
consistently
with
the
position
that
the
state
of
last
known
address
as
shown
by
the
records
and
that
would
be
the
state
and
new
york
has
agreed
that
texas
versus
new
jersey
only
required
some
indicia
which
would
show
the
state
and
this
indicia
is
shown
by
western
union’s
ledger
records
that,
that
state
would
take
in
all
instances
except
where
a
draft
has
been
issued
to
a
sendee
in
which
situation
the
sendee
state
would
take.
thank
you
very
much.
