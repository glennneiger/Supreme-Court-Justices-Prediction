ms.
winifred
l.
wentworth
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
state
of
florida
as
i
think
counsel
for
pennsylvania
has
indicated,
now
joins
that
state
and
the
other
parties
which
are
now
unanimous
in
opposition
to
new
york
in
this
case.
the
state
of
arizona
which
has
also
coincided
with
florida's
position
in
the
case,
also
now
joins
in
the
pennsylvania
position
and
asking
the
court
to
reject
the
conclusion
of
the
special
master
and
to
clarify
and
to
apply
the
creditor
address
rule
adopted
in
the
texas
case.
we
believe
that
the
opinion
in
that
case
in
referring
to
the
state
of
the
last
known
address
of
a
creditor
according
to
the
debtor's
books,
did
not
state
and
did
not
intend
that
the
address
must
be
an
address
specifically
declared
by
the
creditor
for
residence
purposes,
but
instead
the
apparent
reference
was
to
a
geographic
creditor
reference
--
creditor
address
which
we
believe
is
what
is
shown
by
western
union
records
in
this
case
as
to
the
address
of
his
office
at
which
a
money
order,
creditor
would
be
entitled
to
a
refund.
that
address
would
both
practically
and
legally
be
the
creditor's
address
so
far
as
the
debt
is
concerned
since
neither
law
nor
custom
has
compelled
the
debtor
to
keep
records
of
the
residence
or
street
or
domiciliary
address
of
the
creditor.
in
addition,
there
are
very
few
instances
when
a
purchaser
designating
a
place
different
from
the
western
union
office
would
result
in
a
different
distribution
which
is
shown
by
pennsylvania's
argument
in
this
case.
florida's
original
argument
was
based
on
the
same
construction
of
the
texas
case,
but
depended
upon
--
in
part
from
the
definition
of
a
creditor
under
our
particular
statute
as
the
payee
of
an
obligation
and
upon
a
different
view
of
the
particular
contract
and
this
is
involved
in
this
case,
in
case
of
western
union
money
orders.
we
now
accept
the
master's
construction
of
the
contract
and
abandon
the
contention
that
the
destination
state
would
be
the
proper
party
for
escheat
purposes.
the
position
was
presented
for
the
purposes
of
obtaining
a
full
consideration
of
all
of
the
possible
applications
of
the
texas
rule
and
to
obtain
its
clarification.
as
far
as
the
questions
that
we
have
raised,
we
believe
that
the
record
and
the
briefs
of
all
the
parties
in
this
case
would
show
the
greater
virtue
of
pennsylvania's
argument
and
we
now
join
them
because
of
the
need
of
rule
that
is
both
reasonable
and
have
very
wide
applicability
under
all
types
of
escheat
or
custodial
taking
loss
and
as
to
a
wide
variety
of
intangible
properties.
we
urge
to
the
court
to
apply
the
texas
decision
to
preserve
the
creditor
address
rule
in
accord
with
its
primary
intention
in
that
case
to
give
weight
to
the
fact
that
the
debt
is
the
property
of
a
creditor
and
not
the
debtor
and
to
permit
the
debtor
domiciliary
escheat
only
if
in
this
case,
western
union's
records
should
in
some
isolated
instance
fail
to
show
the
address
of
the
office
where
this
money
is
payable,
where
the
obligation
was
issued
and
where
it
is,
it
could
be
refunded
to
its
creditor
or
where
the
state
that
would
have
that
right
has
no
escheat
law.
thank
you.
