mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
prior
decision
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
counsel
is
in
error
because
the
trial
examiner
whose
findings
were
adopted
by
the
board,
found
on
the
basis
of
the
fax
in
the
records
some
of
which
i
will
allude
to
that
the
situation
is
not
exactly
as
my
colleague
has
depicted.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
judge
gibson
thought
that
there
was
an
absence
of
evidence
to
sustain
the
board's
finding
that
there
were
--
that
you
couldn't
reach
these
people
by
alternative
channels.
that
is
to
satisfy
the
babcock
test.
there
are
really
alternative
basis
for
the
board's
finding
in
this
case.
i
think
the
trial
examiner's
report
shows
that
more
clearly,
even
the
board's
decision
does
because
the
board
largely,
just
summarily
affirm
the
trial
examiner.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
with
respect
to
one
leg
of
holding
in
the
case,
there
are
really
two
legs.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
the
problem
with
that
is,
however,
that
the
eighth
circuit
didn't
reach
the
babcock
end
of
it
as
i
read
their
opinion,
they
sustained
this
on
the
logan
valley.
mr.
norton
j.
come
unless
the
court
is
persuaded
that
the
facts
are
so
clear
and
they
are
simple
enough
so
that
remand
would
not
be
necessary.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
a
better
practice
would
probably
be
the
remand
if
you
find
it
necessary
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
ordinarily
the
court
does
that,
we
had
a
case
called
insurance
agents
and
the
independent
contractor
issue
where
the
court
after
finding
that
the
seventh
circuit
had
applied
an
erroneous
standard,
proceeded
to
evaluate
the
evidence
and
enforce
the
board's
order.
but,
so
that
you
don't
have
to
reach
the
babcock
access
test,
if
we
are
right
on
our
first
premise,
that
the
circumstances
here
are
in
every
relevant
respect
similar
to
those
in
logan
valley,
if
they
are,
we
submit.
you
have
an
appropriate
place
for
the
exercise
of
the
union's
organizational
activity
and
under
principles
that
go
back
as
far
as
schneider
against
town
of
irvington.
the
exercise
of
free
expression
on
an
appropriate
place
cannot
be
upgraded
just
because,
it
could
be
carried
on
elsewhere.
so
i'd
like
to
deal
with
the
logan
valley
aspect
of
the
case.
mr.
norton
j.
come
right.
mr.
norton
j.
come
each
of
the
stores
is
a
supermarket
type
structure,
which
is
about
70,000
square
feet,
situated
on
a
large
expanse
of
a
land,
the
west
store
according
to
the
evidence
in
the
records
about
5
acres.
the
store
buildings
are
located
at
the
rear
of
the
property
and
between
the
store
and
the
street
is
a
large
open
parking
area
about
350
feet
wide
and
200
to
375
feet
deep
with
space
for
350
cars.
it
also
has
space
in
here
for
the
employees
to
park
in
certain
sections
of
this
parking
area
and
each
store
has
125
employees
and
the
evidence
shows
that
the
overwhelming
majority
of
them
drive
to
work
or
pull
the
work.
so
you've
got
an
awful
lot
of
employee
cars,
that
are
parked
on
this
parking
lot.
the
record
also
shows
that
the
employees
in
many
cases
eat
their
lunches
in
the
parking
lot,
during
the
lunch
hour
and,
of
course,
they're
at
the
store
during
their
entire
working
day.
now
the
property--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
that
dealt
with
a
municipality
your
honor.
however,
i
intend
to
make
to
jump
from
that
to
this
situation,
based
upon
logan
valley
in
a
moment.
the
property
and
the
record
is
perfectly
clear
on
this,
is
not
enclosed
by
fences
or
other
physical
barriers
nor
the
parking
lots
are
marked
with
signs
restricting
entrance.
the
entrance
is
that
both
lots
are
on
heavily
traveled
highways
with
speed
limits
of
35
to
40
miles
an
hour.
the
highways
do
not
have
sidewalks.
there
are,
however,
according
to
the
record,
grassy
islands
or
burns
in
front
of
the
entrance
to
the
east
store.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
your
honor,
i
think
that
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
logan
valley
was
a
first
amendment
case.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
but
the
problem
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
with
regard
to
equating
interpreting
section
7,
which
gives
employees
the
right
to
organize
through
their
representatives.
where
that
comes
into
collision
with
private
property,
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
made
it
clear
that
what
you
have
to
do
is
to
balance
the
property
right
against
the
organizational
right.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
your
honor,
because,
i
submit
that
babcock
makes
it
clear
that
this
accommodation
must
be
done
with
its
little
dislocation
of
the
one
as
the
other,
and
that
in
making
the
accommodation,
the
facts
of
the
particular
use
of
the
property
make
a
difference.
now
that
fact
involved
a
situation
of
a
parking
lot
that
was
not
open
to
the
public.
it
was
not
fenced,
although
there
was
a
fenced
lot
in
one
of
the
companion
cases.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
don't
think
that
you
need
to
reach
the
first
amendment
problem
with
respect
to
the
national
labor
relations
act.
you
might
conceivably
find
that
in
a
parking
lot
situation,
such
as
we
have
here,
that
this
accommodation
of
property
rights
might
not
be
mandated
by
the
first
amendment,
but
that
nonetheless,
congress
could
in
the
exercise
of
its
power
to
regulate
commerce
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
is
not
babcock
because
as
we
read
babcock--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
the
eighth
circuit
applied
by
analogy
logan
valley--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
don't
think
so
your
honor,
because
they
sustained
the
board's
finding,
that
this
was
a
violation
of
section
7.
the
problem
is
that
babcock
didn't
--
as
we
read
it,
laid
on
a
holding
that
is
to
govern
every
conceivable
property,
organizational
right
situation.
you
did
not
have
a
case
of
open
property,
and
the
difference
that
the
openness
of
the
property
makes
is,
that
as
we
read,
and
that
the
court's
opinion
in
logan
valley,
we
believe,
makes
this
clear
is
that
when
the
employer
has
opened
up
his
property
to
members
of
the
public
or
be
it
for
the
purpose
of
only
patronizing
the
store
and
to
every
man--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
and
that's
the
point
that
i'm
coming
to.
that
to
close
it,
to
those
members
of
the
public,
i.e.,
the
union
and
its
representatives
who
have
a
message
germane
to
that
store
about
its
labor
conditions
and
appealing
to
the
employees
to
join
the
union,
is
to
create
an
invidious
discrimination
that
makes
the
openness
of
the
property,
turned
upon,
whether
or
not
the
employer
agrees
with
the
message
that
this
segment
of
the
public
is
putting
across--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
am
not
relying
on
it
directly,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
it's
indirectly
in
this
picture
in
the
sense.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
it
is
only
in
this,
to
the
extent
that
the
right
to
self-organization
and
the
right
to
have--
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
statutory
right.
going
back
to
thomas
against
collins,
it
is
very
clear
that
it's
not
--
this
comes
not
only
from
section
7,
but
it
also
comes
from
the
first
amendment.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
for
purposes
of
our
position
in
this
case,
i
do
not
have
to
establish
that
the
right
of
the
union
organizers
to
get
on
this
property
is
mandated
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
am
using
the
principle
that
logan
valley
established
for
purposes
of
the
first
amendment
by
analogy
for
making
a
reasonable
balance
of
organizational
rights
and
property
rights
for
purposes
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
this
isn't
the
first
time
that
this
court
has
done
that
in
a
labor
board
context,
it
did
it
in
linn
against
plant
guard
workers
involving
the
question
of
deformation
in
a
labor
dispute.
the
court
said,
that
although
the
first
amendment
wasn't
controlling
here
under,
nonetheless
the
principles
under
the
first
amendment
are
relevant
by
way
of
analogy,
and
it's
only
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
the
way
i
read
the
eighth
circuit's
opinion,
your
honor,
but
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor
and
i
think
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that,
that
you
can
do
so
because
all
we
have
to
establish
here
is
not
a
violation
of
a
first
amendment,
but
a
violation
of
section
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
--
well,
the
eighth
circuit
had
before
it
a
board
order
which
was
premised
on
the
ground
that
there
was
an
evasion,
a
violation
of
section
8(a)(1)
of
the
act,
which
makes
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
an
employer
to
restrain
or
interfere
the
employees
and
the
exercise
of
their
organizational
rights.
the
board
thought
that
there
was
in
promulgating
a
ban
which
completely
prohibited
union
organizers
using
the
parking
lot.
the
company
in
imposing
that
kind
of
a
blanket
thing
had
violated
section
8(a)(1)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
now
in
arriving
at
that
conclusion,
the
board
and
the
trial
examiner,
even
more
specifically,
balanced
the
detriment
to
the
employees'
organizational
rights
being
deprived
of
using
this
parking
lot
facility,
as
against
the
impairment
of
the
employers'
property
interest.
it
found,
at
least
on
one
way
of
its
finding,
that
since
as
in
logan
valley,
--
and
unlike
in
babcock,
these
were
premises
that
were
open
to
the
public.
the
employer
had
appreciated
his
property
right
unlike
in
babcock
where
he
had
no
justifiable
claim
to
right
of
privacy
because
he
had
opened
up
the
parking
lot,
a
parking
lot
by
its
nature
is
full
of
commotion
and
movement
and
that
--
and
there
was
no
showing
that
the
presence
of
the
organizers
there,
was
disrupting
the
normal
operation
of
the
employer's
business.
if
there
were
instances
of
such
disruption,
the
way
to
check
that,
is
to
check
the
individual
instances
not
to
completely
ban
the
activity
and
the
company
did
filed
a
charge
with
respect
to
that
conduct
with
the
board's
general
counsel,
who
found
insufficient
evidence
to
issue
warrant,
the
issuance
of
a
complaint
on
it.
so
you
have
a
situation
then
of
property
that
had
been
opened
up,
where
the
conduct
of
the
union
organization
did
not
disrupt
the
normal
operation
of
the
business.
balancing
that
against
the
inconvenience
of
the
union
of
being
forced
to
conduct
this
activity,
elsewhere
because
as
mr.
justice
marshall
pointed
out,
until
they
got
the
names,
and
home
addresses,
they
could
not
really
effectively
organize,
and
the
only
way
they
could
get
that,
was
by
access
to
the
parking
lot.
once
they
were
denied
access
to
that
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
they
had
an
employee
who
was
also
a
union
organization
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
however.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
however
the
testimony
of
the
union
organizer
which
was
credited
by
the
examiner,
was
that,
the
bulk
of
the
names
and
address
came
from
contact
on
the
parking
lot.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
i
suppose
that,
that
could
be
a
one
way
of
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
he
could
go
to
a
state
court
and
attempt
to
get
an
injunction,
if
he
found
that
there
was
activity
that
was
interfering
with
his
operation.
the
point
is
that
he
was
unable
to
manage
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
the
question,
the
question
is
whether
or
not
by
opening
it
at
up
for
the
public
he
is
not
narrowed
his
property
interest
to
the
point
where
he
cannot
at
least
impose
a
blanket
ban.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
am
relying
on
section
7
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
because
i
think
that,
that
is
what
we
have
in
this
case.
i
think
that
whether
logan
valley
would
have
required
this
result
in
a
first
amendment
case
on
these
premises,
is
a
another
question
which
you
may
have
to
reach
in
the
next
case,
i
don't
think
that
you
have
it
here.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
at
least
where
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
that
is
correct,
at
least
where
the
dimensions
of
the
parking
lot
are
such
that
it
creates
a
substantial
buffer
zone,
between
the
store
and
the
nearest,
closest
public
place
where
you
could
appeal
to
the
audience
that
you
are
appealing
to.
now
some
of
these
retail
stores
in
a
downtown
part
of
town,
may
front
on
a
public
sidewalk
and
the
employees
may
come
through
that
door.
in
that
case,
it
maybe
possible
to
reach
them
adequately,
without
the
necessity
for
getting
on
to
the
parking
lot.
so
i
don't
want
to
state
my
rule,
so
broadly
that
i
am
foreclosing
what
the
board
would
do
in
that
kind
of
a
case.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
only
--
it
only
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
and
it
also
raises
the
question
as
to
whether
you
have
to
really
bear
down
so
strongly
on
inaccessibility.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
he
does
that
--
he
does
that
even
parking
car
on
the
parking
lot.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
it,
your
honor,
i
think
that's
something
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
these
are
outside
organizers.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
employee
is
using
it
using
it
to
go
to
work
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
and
the
question
is
however,
that
on
one
leg
of
the
company's
argument
here,
as
i
understand
it,
it
would
have
been
all
right
here
had
the
union
put
up
a
picket
line,
that
appealed
to
the
consuming
public
and
urged
them
not
to
patronize
this
store,
because
of
its
non-union
conditions.
this
is
one
of
the
points,
that
they
say
distinguished
this
case
from
logan
valley.
well,
i
submit
that,
that
just
turns
upside
down
the
priorities
in
this
area,
because
first
of
all
the
employees
are
no
second
class
citizens
of
this
store.
they
have
a
more
substantial
context
with
the
store
than
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
but
in
logan
valley
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
in
the
logan
valley,
you
didn't
have
employees
either.
you
had
stranger
organizers,
who
were
on
the
parking
lot
and
they
were
appealing
the
members
of
the
parking
lot.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no
your
honor
i
do
not
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes
i
know
that,
that
requires
a
state
as
far
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
babcock
does
make
a
distinction
with
respect
to
close
premises.
in
republic
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
so
read
logan
plaza,
but
that
of
course
is
the
problem
that
we
have
here.
mr.
norton
j.
come
however
it
was
certainly
called
to
this
court's
attention
and
it
was
distinguished
on
the
very
grounds
that
i
am
now
urging
by
the
prevailing
parties
in
logan
valley
but
i
think
the
short
answer
to
it
is
the
reason
why
it
wasn't
mentioned,
was
the
one
that
justice
white,
at
least
propounded
that
a
different
balance
is
called
for
where
you
have
open
property
than
when
you
have
the
kind
of
closed
property
that
you
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
you
can
from
the
trial,
i
get
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
the
trial
examiner
comes
very,
very
close
to
articulating
it
the
way
i
do.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
he
has
two
sections
of
his
report,
one
which
deals
with
the
babcock
point
and
the
other
with
the
second
ground.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
they
would
not
have
the
right
to
go
into
the
closed
portion
but
if
he
does
not
permit
them
into
the
closed
portion,
i
submit
that
the
result
would
be
that
he
would
have
to
be
subjected
to
the
activity
on
the
open
portion.
mr.
norton
j.
come
he
could
minimize
the
amount
of
disruption,
i
don't
want
to
use
that
word
but
dislocation
by
how
close
he
would
permit
the
union
to
reach
the
employees,
we
have
that
problem
in
the
secondary
(inaudible).
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
the
word
disruption
is
not
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
might
point
out,
your
honor,
that
there
were
6
to
13
in
logan
valley,
and
there
is
no
showing
in
the
record
here
that
these
nine
were
only
there
for
a
part
of
the
time
wherever
present
all
at
the
same
time
on
the
parking
lot
and
there
were
nine
in
the
area
but
the
record
does
not
show
that
they
were
all
present.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
in
terms
of
the
argument
that
i
have
been
making,
i
don't
think
that
that
would
alter
the
fundamental
balance,
however,
that
is
not
this
case.
and
i
don't
want
to
speak
for
the
board
on
that
because
it
does
not
have
such
a
situation
but
i
think
that
the
logic
of
at
least
argument
that
i
have
been
making,
that
would
not
alter
the
situation
because
you
would
still
have
the
same
disparity
in
treatment
as
to
what
members
of
the
public
you
are
going
with
a
purpose
related
to
the
functioning
of
the
store
and
i
emphasize
that
because
we
don't
have
here
something
that
is
unrelated.
mr.
norton
j.
come
not
where
the
non-customers
have
a
purpose
germane
to
the
operation
of
the
store
as
we
have
here.
mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
prior
decision
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
counsel
is
in
error
because
the
trial
examiner
whose
findings
were
adopted
by
the
board,
found
on
the
basis
of
the
fax
in
the
records
some
of
which
i
will
allude
to
that
the
situation
is
not
exactly
as
my
colleague
has
depicted.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
judge
gibson
thought
that
there
was
an
absence
of
evidence
to
sustain
the
board's
finding
that
there
were
--
that
you
couldn't
reach
these
people
by
alternative
channels.
that
is
to
satisfy
the
babcock
test.
there
are
really
alternative
basis
for
the
board's
finding
in
this
case.
i
think
the
trial
examiner's
report
shows
that
more
clearly,
even
the
board's
decision
does
because
the
board
largely,
just
summarily
affirm
the
trial
examiner.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
with
respect
to
one
leg
of
holding
in
the
case,
there
are
really
two
legs.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
the
problem
with
that
is,
however,
that
the
eighth
circuit
didn't
reach
the
babcock
end
of
it
as
i
read
their
opinion,
they
sustained
this
on
the
logan
valley.
mr.
norton
j.
come
unless
the
court
is
persuaded
that
the
facts
are
so
clear
and
they
are
simple
enough
so
that
remand
would
not
be
necessary.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
a
better
practice
would
probably
be
the
remand
if
you
find
it
necessary
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
ordinarily
the
court
does
that,
we
had
a
case
called
insurance
agents
and
the
independent
contractor
issue
where
the
court
after
finding
that
the
seventh
circuit
had
applied
an
erroneous
standard,
proceeded
to
evaluate
the
evidence
and
enforce
the
board's
order.
but,
so
that
you
don't
have
to
reach
the
babcock
access
test,
if
we
are
right
on
our
first
premise,
that
the
circumstances
here
are
in
every
relevant
respect
similar
to
those
in
logan
valley,
if
they
are,
we
submit.
you
have
an
appropriate
place
for
the
exercise
of
the
union's
organizational
activity
and
under
principles
that
go
back
as
far
as
schneider
against
town
of
irvington.
the
exercise
of
free
expression
on
an
appropriate
place
cannot
be
upgraded
just
because,
it
could
be
carried
on
elsewhere.
so
i'd
like
to
deal
with
the
logan
valley
aspect
of
the
case.
mr.
norton
j.
come
right.
mr.
norton
j.
come
each
of
the
stores
is
a
supermarket
type
structure,
which
is
about
70,000
square
feet,
situated
on
a
large
expanse
of
a
land,
the
west
store
according
to
the
evidence
in
the
records
about
5
acres.
the
store
buildings
are
located
at
the
rear
of
the
property
and
between
the
store
and
the
street
is
a
large
open
parking
area
about
350
feet
wide
and
200
to
375
feet
deep
with
space
for
350
cars.
it
also
has
space
in
here
for
the
employees
to
park
in
certain
sections
of
this
parking
area
and
each
store
has
125
employees
and
the
evidence
shows
that
the
overwhelming
majority
of
them
drive
to
work
or
pull
the
work.
so
you've
got
an
awful
lot
of
employee
cars,
that
are
parked
on
this
parking
lot.
the
record
also
shows
that
the
employees
in
many
cases
eat
their
lunches
in
the
parking
lot,
during
the
lunch
hour
and,
of
course,
they're
at
the
store
during
their
entire
working
day.
now
the
property--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
that
dealt
with
a
municipality
your
honor.
however,
i
intend
to
make
to
jump
from
that
to
this
situation,
based
upon
logan
valley
in
a
moment.
the
property
and
the
record
is
perfectly
clear
on
this,
is
not
enclosed
by
fences
or
other
physical
barriers
nor
the
parking
lots
are
marked
with
signs
restricting
entrance.
the
entrance
is
that
both
lots
are
on
heavily
traveled
highways
with
speed
limits
of
35
to
40
miles
an
hour.
the
highways
do
not
have
sidewalks.
there
are,
however,
according
to
the
record,
grassy
islands
or
burns
in
front
of
the
entrance
to
the
east
store.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
your
honor,
i
think
that
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
logan
valley
was
a
first
amendment
case.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
but
the
problem
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
with
regard
to
equating
interpreting
section
7,
which
gives
employees
the
right
to
organize
through
their
representatives.
where
that
comes
into
collision
with
private
property,
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
made
it
clear
that
what
you
have
to
do
is
to
balance
the
property
right
against
the
organizational
right.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
your
honor,
because,
i
submit
that
babcock
makes
it
clear
that
this
accommodation
must
be
done
with
its
little
dislocation
of
the
one
as
the
other,
and
that
in
making
the
accommodation,
the
facts
of
the
particular
use
of
the
property
make
a
difference.
now
that
fact
involved
a
situation
of
a
parking
lot
that
was
not
open
to
the
public.
it
was
not
fenced,
although
there
was
a
fenced
lot
in
one
of
the
companion
cases.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
don't
think
that
you
need
to
reach
the
first
amendment
problem
with
respect
to
the
national
labor
relations
act.
you
might
conceivably
find
that
in
a
parking
lot
situation,
such
as
we
have
here,
that
this
accommodation
of
property
rights
might
not
be
mandated
by
the
first
amendment,
but
that
nonetheless,
congress
could
in
the
exercise
of
its
power
to
regulate
commerce
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
is
not
babcock
because
as
we
read
babcock--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
the
eighth
circuit
applied
by
analogy
logan
valley--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
don't
think
so
your
honor,
because
they
sustained
the
board's
finding,
that
this
was
a
violation
of
section
7.
the
problem
is
that
babcock
didn't
--
as
we
read
it,
laid
on
a
holding
that
is
to
govern
every
conceivable
property,
organizational
right
situation.
you
did
not
have
a
case
of
open
property,
and
the
difference
that
the
openness
of
the
property
makes
is,
that
as
we
read,
and
that
the
court's
opinion
in
logan
valley,
we
believe,
makes
this
clear
is
that
when
the
employer
has
opened
up
his
property
to
members
of
the
public
or
be
it
for
the
purpose
of
only
patronizing
the
store
and
to
every
man--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
and
that's
the
point
that
i'm
coming
to.
that
to
close
it,
to
those
members
of
the
public,
i.e.,
the
union
and
its
representatives
who
have
a
message
germane
to
that
store
about
its
labor
conditions
and
appealing
to
the
employees
to
join
the
union,
is
to
create
an
invidious
discrimination
that
makes
the
openness
of
the
property,
turned
upon,
whether
or
not
the
employer
agrees
with
the
message
that
this
segment
of
the
public
is
putting
across--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
am
not
relying
on
it
directly,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
it's
indirectly
in
this
picture
in
the
sense.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
it
is
only
in
this,
to
the
extent
that
the
right
to
self-organization
and
the
right
to
have--
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
statutory
right.
going
back
to
thomas
against
collins,
it
is
very
clear
that
it's
not
--
this
comes
not
only
from
section
7,
but
it
also
comes
from
the
first
amendment.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
for
purposes
of
our
position
in
this
case,
i
do
not
have
to
establish
that
the
right
of
the
union
organizers
to
get
on
this
property
is
mandated
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
am
using
the
principle
that
logan
valley
established
for
purposes
of
the
first
amendment
by
analogy
for
making
a
reasonable
balance
of
organizational
rights
and
property
rights
for
purposes
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
this
isn't
the
first
time
that
this
court
has
done
that
in
a
labor
board
context,
it
did
it
in
linn
against
plant
guard
workers
involving
the
question
of
deformation
in
a
labor
dispute.
the
court
said,
that
although
the
first
amendment
wasn't
controlling
here
under,
nonetheless
the
principles
under
the
first
amendment
are
relevant
by
way
of
analogy,
and
it's
only
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
the
way
i
read
the
eighth
circuit's
opinion,
your
honor,
but
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor
and
i
think
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that,
that
you
can
do
so
because
all
we
have
to
establish
here
is
not
a
violation
of
a
first
amendment,
but
a
violation
of
section
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
--
well,
the
eighth
circuit
had
before
it
a
board
order
which
was
premised
on
the
ground
that
there
was
an
evasion,
a
violation
of
section
8(a)(1)
of
the
act,
which
makes
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
an
employer
to
restrain
or
interfere
the
employees
and
the
exercise
of
their
organizational
rights.
the
board
thought
that
there
was
in
promulgating
a
ban
which
completely
prohibited
union
organizers
using
the
parking
lot.
the
company
in
imposing
that
kind
of
a
blanket
thing
had
violated
section
8(a)(1)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
now
in
arriving
at
that
conclusion,
the
board
and
the
trial
examiner,
even
more
specifically,
balanced
the
detriment
to
the
employees'
organizational
rights
being
deprived
of
using
this
parking
lot
facility,
as
against
the
impairment
of
the
employers'
property
interest.
it
found,
at
least
on
one
way
of
its
finding,
that
since
as
in
logan
valley,
--
and
unlike
in
babcock,
these
were
premises
that
were
open
to
the
public.
the
employer
had
appreciated
his
property
right
unlike
in
babcock
where
he
had
no
justifiable
claim
to
right
of
privacy
because
he
had
opened
up
the
parking
lot,
a
parking
lot
by
its
nature
is
full
of
commotion
and
movement
and
that
--
and
there
was
no
showing
that
the
presence
of
the
organizers
there,
was
disrupting
the
normal
operation
of
the
employer's
business.
if
there
were
instances
of
such
disruption,
the
way
to
check
that,
is
to
check
the
individual
instances
not
to
completely
ban
the
activity
and
the
company
did
filed
a
charge
with
respect
to
that
conduct
with
the
board's
general
counsel,
who
found
insufficient
evidence
to
issue
warrant,
the
issuance
of
a
complaint
on
it.
so
you
have
a
situation
then
of
property
that
had
been
opened
up,
where
the
conduct
of
the
union
organization
did
not
disrupt
the
normal
operation
of
the
business.
balancing
that
against
the
inconvenience
of
the
union
of
being
forced
to
conduct
this
activity,
elsewhere
because
as
mr.
justice
marshall
pointed
out,
until
they
got
the
names,
and
home
addresses,
they
could
not
really
effectively
organize,
and
the
only
way
they
could
get
that,
was
by
access
to
the
parking
lot.
once
they
were
denied
access
to
that
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
they
had
an
employee
who
was
also
a
union
organization
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
however.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
however
the
testimony
of
the
union
organizer
which
was
credited
by
the
examiner,
was
that,
the
bulk
of
the
names
and
address
came
from
contact
on
the
parking
lot.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
i
suppose
that,
that
could
be
a
one
way
of
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
he
could
go
to
a
state
court
and
attempt
to
get
an
injunction,
if
he
found
that
there
was
activity
that
was
interfering
with
his
operation.
the
point
is
that
he
was
unable
to
manage
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
the
question,
the
question
is
whether
or
not
by
opening
it
at
up
for
the
public
he
is
not
narrowed
his
property
interest
to
the
point
where
he
cannot
at
least
impose
a
blanket
ban.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
am
relying
on
section
7
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
because
i
think
that,
that
is
what
we
have
in
this
case.
i
think
that
whether
logan
valley
would
have
required
this
result
in
a
first
amendment
case
on
these
premises,
is
a
another
question
which
you
may
have
to
reach
in
the
next
case,
i
don't
think
that
you
have
it
here.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
at
least
where
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
that
is
correct,
at
least
where
the
dimensions
of
the
parking
lot
are
such
that
it
creates
a
substantial
buffer
zone,
between
the
store
and
the
nearest,
closest
public
place
where
you
could
appeal
to
the
audience
that
you
are
appealing
to.
now
some
of
these
retail
stores
in
a
downtown
part
of
town,
may
front
on
a
public
sidewalk
and
the
employees
may
come
through
that
door.
in
that
case,
it
maybe
possible
to
reach
them
adequately,
without
the
necessity
for
getting
on
to
the
parking
lot.
so
i
don't
want
to
state
my
rule,
so
broadly
that
i
am
foreclosing
what
the
board
would
do
in
that
kind
of
a
case.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
only
--
it
only
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
and
it
also
raises
the
question
as
to
whether
you
have
to
really
bear
down
so
strongly
on
inaccessibility.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
he
does
that
--
he
does
that
even
parking
car
on
the
parking
lot.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
it,
your
honor,
i
think
that's
something
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
these
are
outside
organizers.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
employee
is
using
it
using
it
to
go
to
work
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
and
the
question
is
however,
that
on
one
leg
of
the
company's
argument
here,
as
i
understand
it,
it
would
have
been
all
right
here
had
the
union
put
up
a
picket
line,
that
appealed
to
the
consuming
public
and
urged
them
not
to
patronize
this
store,
because
of
its
non-union
conditions.
this
is
one
of
the
points,
that
they
say
distinguished
this
case
from
logan
valley.
well,
i
submit
that,
that
just
turns
upside
down
the
priorities
in
this
area,
because
first
of
all
the
employees
are
no
second
class
citizens
of
this
store.
they
have
a
more
substantial
context
with
the
store
than
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
but
in
logan
valley
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
in
the
logan
valley,
you
didn't
have
employees
either.
you
had
stranger
organizers,
who
were
on
the
parking
lot
and
they
were
appealing
the
members
of
the
parking
lot.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no
your
honor
i
do
not
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes
i
know
that,
that
requires
a
state
as
far
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
babcock
does
make
a
distinction
with
respect
to
close
premises.
in
republic
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
so
read
logan
plaza,
but
that
of
course
is
the
problem
that
we
have
here.
mr.
norton
j.
come
however
it
was
certainly
called
to
this
court's
attention
and
it
was
distinguished
on
the
very
grounds
that
i
am
now
urging
by
the
prevailing
parties
in
logan
valley
but
i
think
the
short
answer
to
it
is
the
reason
why
it
wasn't
mentioned,
was
the
one
that
justice
white,
at
least
propounded
that
a
different
balance
is
called
for
where
you
have
open
property
than
when
you
have
the
kind
of
closed
property
that
you
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
you
can
from
the
trial,
i
get
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
the
trial
examiner
comes
very,
very
close
to
articulating
it
the
way
i
do.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
he
has
two
sections
of
his
report,
one
which
deals
with
the
babcock
point
and
the
other
with
the
second
ground.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
they
would
not
have
the
right
to
go
into
the
closed
portion
but
if
he
does
not
permit
them
into
the
closed
portion,
i
submit
that
the
result
would
be
that
he
would
have
to
be
subjected
to
the
activity
on
the
open
portion.
mr.
norton
j.
come
he
could
minimize
the
amount
of
disruption,
i
don't
want
to
use
that
word
but
dislocation
by
how
close
he
would
permit
the
union
to
reach
the
employees,
we
have
that
problem
in
the
secondary
(inaudible).
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
the
word
disruption
is
not
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
might
point
out,
your
honor,
that
there
were
6
to
13
in
logan
valley,
and
there
is
no
showing
in
the
record
here
that
these
nine
were
only
there
for
a
part
of
the
time
wherever
present
all
at
the
same
time
on
the
parking
lot
and
there
were
nine
in
the
area
but
the
record
does
not
show
that
they
were
all
present.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
in
terms
of
the
argument
that
i
have
been
making,
i
don't
think
that
that
would
alter
the
fundamental
balance,
however,
that
is
not
this
case.
and
i
don't
want
to
speak
for
the
board
on
that
because
it
does
not
have
such
a
situation
but
i
think
that
the
logic
of
at
least
argument
that
i
have
been
making,
that
would
not
alter
the
situation
because
you
would
still
have
the
same
disparity
in
treatment
as
to
what
members
of
the
public
you
are
going
with
a
purpose
related
to
the
functioning
of
the
store
and
i
emphasize
that
because
we
don't
have
here
something
that
is
unrelated.
mr.
norton
j.
come
not
where
the
non-customers
have
a
purpose
germane
to
the
operation
of
the
store
as
we
have
here.
