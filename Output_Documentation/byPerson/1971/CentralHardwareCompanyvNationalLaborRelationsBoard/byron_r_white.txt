justice
byron
r.
white
are
the
cases
cited?
justice
byron
r.
white
lets
assume
this
case
had
arisen
in
the
parking
lot
of
the
shopping
center
involved
in
logan
valley
--
justice
byron
r.
white
there
wouldn't
be
any
question,
you
wouldn't
even
reach
the
babcock
&
wilcox
situation,
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
union,
would
be
there
at
the
time
that
you
are
exercising
free
speech
rights
like
anybody
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
counsel
is
right
in
answer
to
my
question,
this
is
the
first
case
in
a
long,
long
time
from
the
labor
board,
where
there
is
no
evidence
at
all
to
support
his
findings.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
wilcox
or
babcock
or
some
kind
of
argument
mr.
come,
but
is
it
--
i
just
ask
you
again,
is
the
first
amendment
relevant
to
this
case
or
not?
are
you
relying
on
the
first
amendment
to
any
extent
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
any
extent
i
said
indirectly
or
any
other
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
can
it
be
unless
the
retail
establishment
operator
is
equated
to
a
public
body?
justice
byron
r.
white
statutory
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
viz-a-viz
government,
that's
viz-a-viz
the
state,
that's
thomas
against
collins
as
my
brother
white
says
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
don't
come
into
play,
unless
or
until
it's
governmental
action
that
suppresses
free
speech.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
to
the
extent
that
you
rely
on
logan
valley,
you
rely
on
the
first
amendment,
do
you
not,
do
you
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
we
to
read
the
eighth
circuit
decision,
as
resting
on
the
argument
that
you're
now
making
to
us?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
the
purpose
of
a
labor
dispute.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
did
the
trial
examiner
or
the
board
said?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
quite
articulated.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
or
you
are
saying
that
the
employer
may
do
no
more
to
restrict
speech
than
might
the
government
and
whatever
the
government
can't
do
the
employers
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
should
lead
you
to
say
that
babcock
was
wrong.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
this
is
what
babcock
tells?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
very
same
kind
of
means
that
are
present
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
invasion,
the
burden
on
the
employers
is
different
here
than
babcock?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
parking
lots
open
to
the
public.
justice
byron
r.
white
under
what
rule,
it's
just
opened
--
i
mean
it's
just.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
will
put
it
this
way,
a
manufacturing
establishment
has
a
much
more
limited
clientèle
coming
to
them,
there
may
be
an
establishment
that
will
take
anybody
as
a
customer.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that's
all
i'm
saying.
