mr.
bernard
dunau
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it
is
necessary
to
be
blunt
and
to
be
blunt,
the
only
way
the
court
of
appeals
can
be
reversed
in
this
case
is
for
this
court
to
repudiate
logan
valley.
what
do
we
have
here
instead
of
having,
as
we
had
in
logan
valley,
employees
picketing,
non-employees
picketing
at
the
entrance
to
the
store.
here,
we
had
them
on
the
parking
lot
asking,
talking
to
employees,
seeking
to
get
them
to
join
the
union.
suppose
these
non-employee
union
representatives,
in
this
case,
had
done
exactly
what
the
union
representatives
had
done
in
logan
valley,
namely;
they
had
picketed
at
the
entrance
to
the
store,
with
a
sign
saying,
“central
hardware
is
non-union.
these
employees
are
not
receiving
union
wages
or
other
benefits,”
retail
clerks
union
local
725.
that
would
be
exactly
logan
valley.
in
logan
valley,
the
distances
from
the
entrance
to
the
parking
lot
to
the
store
were
350
feet
to
400-500
feet.
here
the
distances
from
the
entrance
of
the
parking
lot
to
the
entrance
of
the
store
is
425
feet
to
475
feet
at
one
store,
260
feet
to
1,000
feet
at
another
store.
now
what
we
can
make
of
this?
the
blunting
of
the
right
to
communicate
is
identical.
you
can't
get
any
closer
to
that
entrance
whether
it's
a
single
store
parking
lot,
or
a
shopping
center
parking
lot.
are
or
we
to
say,
therefore,
that
if
a
single
store
parking
owner,
single
store
owner,
circles
himself
for
the
parking
lot,
that's
okay.
but
if
that
single
store
man,
should
share
premises
in
a
shopping
center
and
a
group
of
them
circle
themselves
within
a
parking
lot,
they
cannot
bar
communication.
mr.
bernard
dunau
sir,
there
are
two
answers
to
that.
the
first
amendment
is
incorporated
in
section
7.
everything
that
the
first
amendment
protects
is
protected
by
section
7
with
this
enhanced,
and
important
addition.
the
first
amendment
can
reach
only
state
action.
section
7
reaches
employer
action
but
the
substance
of
what
section
7
protects
is
identical
with
what
the
first
amendment
protects.
mr.
bernard
dunau
but
every
area
in
which
free
speech
is
relevant
to
a
labor
dispute
is
coextensive
and
that's
all
we
have
to
have.
mr.
bernard
dunau
right,
but
if
section
7
does,
as
we
maintain
incorporate
the
first
amendment
with
respect
to
what
an
employer
may
or
may
not
do,
then
section
7
reaches
employer
private
action
by
virtue
of
congress
saying,
in
section
7
“we
adopt
the
first
amendment
rights
insofar
as
they
relate
to
labor
disputes.”
secondly,
it
would
be
totally
artificial
to
divide
this
case
based
on
what
section
7
allows
and
disregard
what
the
first
amendment
requires.
in
this
case,
suppose
this
happens
instead
of
the
union
representative
walking
off
the
parking
lot,
he
says,
“i
am
going
to
stay
here,
drag
me
off.”
and
he
gets
dragged
off
by
the
police,
and
in
this
case,
there
was
at
least
one
instance
where
police
action
was
required
to
remove
the
man.
there
you
have
state
action.
suppose
instead
of
coming
to
the
labor
board
with
its
complaints,
suppose
the
store
keeper
has
sort
of
injunction
on
the
same
grounds.
these
people
are
invading
my
parking
lot,
got
a
conviction,
the
first
amendment
would
be
in
this
case.
now,
how
are
we
to
have
a
rule
which
says
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
that's
exactly
what
i
mean.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
am
sorry
sir,
that's
what
i
should
say
because
the
element
of
what
section
7
protects
here
is
self
organization,
which
means
speaking,
talking
to
people
and
that's
what
section
7
protects,
that's
what
the
first
amendment
protects.
you
cannot
have
one
rule
with
what's
going
to
happen
if
you
are
in
a
state
court
defending
against
the
conviction
or
defending
against
the
injunction
action.
and
have
another
rule
when
the
case
is
before
the
labor
board.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that's
correct.
mr.
bernard
dunau
then
you
have
section
7
which
incorporates
the
free
speech
protections
of
the
first
amendment.
it
is
basic
to
section
7.
what
the
congress
was
doing
in
section
7
was
to
say
to
employers,
you
can
not
abridge
the
right
to
self
organization.
what
is
self
organization?
it's
talking,
it's
speaking,
it's
assembling.
so,
we
have
congress
saying
that
you
mister
private
employer
will
not
abridge,
free
speech
when
it
is
exercised
by
union
representatives
and
we
declare
this
to
be
the
national
rule.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
sir,
the
first
amendment
applies
wherever
it
is
appropriate
to
exercise
the
right
of
free
speech.
in
logan
valley,
it
would
not
have
been
appropriate
to
enter
inside
of
the
store
and
picket
and
when
this
court
decided
logan
valley,
it
wasn't
deciding
that
you
could
enter
the
store
and
hand
bill
it
and
picket.
what
it
said,
was
given
the
exterior
of
the
store
and
the
coincidence
of
the
exterior
of
the
store
would
picketing
and
hand
billing,
you
can
not
prohibit
it
under
the
first
amendment.
if
you
cannot
prohibit
it
under
first
amendment
with
respect
to
state
action,
you
can
not
prohibit
it
under
section
7
with
respect
to
employer
action.
sometimes
it
seems
to
me,
we
need
to
get
right
back
to
the
basics.
the
basics
of
this
statute
as
recorded
on
page
23
of
our
brief,
the
right,
and
this
was
the
congress
--
the
report
of
the
senate
preceding
the
enactment
of
the
wagner
act.
the
right
of
self-organization
is
a
complex
whole,
embracing
the
various
elements
of
meetings,
speeches,
peaceful
picketing,
the
printing
and
distribution
of
pamphlets,
news
and
argument
all
of
which
however
are
traceable
to
the
fundamental
rights
of
expression
and
assembling.
so,
compound
that
the
right
of
self
organization
and
collective
bargaining
is
fundamental
being
one
phase
of
the
process
of
free
association
essential
to
the
democratic
way
of
life.
that
is
what
section
7
did.
that
is
why
the
first
amendment
is
relevant
because
congress
said,
“we
are
adopting
the
first
amendment
standard
in
section
7
and
the
advance
we
made
is
to
say
that
under
the
first
amendment
it
protects
against
state
action,
under
the
section
7
which
adopts
the
substance
of
the
first
amendment,
we
protect
against
private
employer
action.”
mr.
bernard
dunau
exactly
sir,
yes
sir.
by
virtue
of
section
7,
we
are
saying
that
what
a
policemen
is
forbidden
to
do
in
throwing
a
union
representative
off
a
parking
lot,
an
employers
forbidden
to
do.
what
a
state
is
forbidden
to
do
by
way
of
enjoining
free
speech
on
a
parking
lot,
an
employer
is
forbidden
to
do
via
section
7.
that
is
precisely
the
position
we
take.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
sir.
it
should
not
lead
me
to
say
that
babcock
is
wrong
because
logan
valley
rests
--
the
premise
of
logan
valley
is
the
openness
of
the
property.
in
babcock
and
wilcox,
you
were
not
dealing
with
open
property.
there
is
that
vital
distinction
between
whether
the
property
is
open
to
the
public
and
therefore,
an
appropriate
place
in
which
to
express
first
amendment
rights
to
talk,
as
against
where
the
property
is
close
and
therefore
may
not
inappropriate.
mr.
bernard
dunau
well,
if
i
may
say
so
your
honor,
there
has
been
a
suggestion
in
this
case.
it
stems
quite
properly
from
babcock
and
wilcox
that
there
are
somehow
less
rights
under
section
7
when
they
are
exercised
by
non-employees,
than
where
they
are
exercised
by
employees,
that
too
is
fundamentally
in
conflict
with
what
section
7
and
the
national
labor
relations
act
are
about.
mr.
bernard
dunau
but
it
made
it
in
a
case,
in
which
the
property
was
closed.
it
did
not
make
it
in
a
case
in
which
the
property
was
open.
mr.
bernard
dunau
alright
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
suppose
we
take
the
babcock
and
wilcox
standard
and
ignore
the
distinction
between
openness
and
close.
if
you
have
open
property
babcock
and
wilcox
says,
as
part
of
what
you
may
not
do,
you
may
not
discriminate.
now,
if
you
have
open
property
and
admit
every
element
of
that
public
which
has
a
message
which
wants
to
patronize
that
store,
which
wants
to
make
that
store
make
a
profit.
shoppers,
delivery
man,
everybody
under
the
sun
can
come
in.
but
you
close
that
open
property
to
the
union
representative
who
has
got
message
which
the
employer
doesn't
like,
that
is
discrimination.
that
is
inherent
discrimination.
mr.
bernard
dunau
the
inside
of
the
store?
mr.
bernard
dunau
the
inside
of
the
store.
mr.
bernard
dunau
sir,
there
is
a
functional
difference
between
what
you
can
do
inside
a
store
and
what
you
can
do
outside
of
the
store,
it's
based
on
the
use
to
which
the
property
is
put.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
think
this
court
will
say
it,
whenever
it
gets
a
first
amendment
case
in
which
an
employee
tries
to
picket
inside
the
store.
because
the
first
amendment
doesn't
speak
except
as
this
court
speaks
for
it.
now,
it
has
been
perfectly
clear
under
section
7
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
inside
and
outside
the
store,
a
distinction
which
applies
with
respect
to
employees
themselves
because,
it
is
a
store.
the
board
says
that
nobody,
no
employee,
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
non-employees,
no
employee
can
engage
in
union
solicitation
on
the
selling
area
of
the
floor
because
it
conduces
to
disruption.
mr.
bernard
dunau
you
did
your
honor
but...
mr.
bernard
dunau
all
it
does
is
being
back
a
spark
as
to
whether
you
could
or
could
not
eject
someone
from
the
library
but
i
just
don't
remember
well
enough
gentlemen.
mr.
bernard
dunau
inside
is
simply
not
the
same
thing
as
outside.
new
jersey
court
had
no
problem
making
a
distinction
with
respect
to
the
activities
of
students
and
teachers
saying
what
you
can
do
on
the
outside
is
not
the
same
thing
as
what
you
can
do
on
the
inside
because
of
the
difference
to
which
the
property
is
put.
it
seems
to
us
in
this
case,
one
should
get
down
to
saying
is
the
solicitation
on
that
parking
lot
inconsistent
with
the
operation
of
a
parking
lot
or
it
is
not.
no
one
suggesting,
you
can
inundate
that
parking
lot
with
50
organizers,
that's
congesting
it.
no
one
is
saying
you
cannot
require
an
identification
of
non-employees
coming
on
that
parking
lot.
all
we
are
saying
is
you
cannot
blanketly
prohibit
non-employees
on
a
parking
lot
otherwise
open.
the
two
other
elements
which
relevant
to
property.
use
is
not
being
disrupted.
a
right
of
privacy
--
well,
i
can't
imagine
anything
less
private
than
a
parking
lot.
i
think
we
are
capable
of
drawing
distinctions
between
one's
living
room
and
a
parking
lot,
and
what
you
have
left
therefore
is
the
man's
title
to
his
property,
what
he
can
do,
simply
because
he
owns
it
that
gets
back
to
make
a
title
i
had
thought
that
that
was
exactly
what
this
court
said
in
logan
valley
was
not
sufficient
on
the
part
of
a
storekeeper
when
on
the
other
side
you
had
suppression
of
speech
and
what
you
have
here
is
suppression
of
speech.
mr.
bernard
dunau
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it
is
necessary
to
be
blunt
and
to
be

the
only
way
the
court
of
appeals
can
be
reversed
in
this
case
is
for
this

to
repudiate

what
do
we
have
here
instead
of
having,
as
we
had
in
logan

employees
picketing,
non-employees

at

here,
we
had
them
on

seeking
to

suppose
these
non-employee

in
this

had
done
exactly
what
the
union

had
done
in
logan

retail

that
would
be
exactly
logan
valley.
in
logan
valley,
the
distances
from
the
entrance
to
the
parking
lot
to
the
store
were
350
feet
to
400-500
feet.
here
the
distances
from
the
entrance
of
the
parking
lot
to
the
entrance
of
the
store
is
425
feet
to
475
feet
at
one
store,
260
feet
to
1,000
feet
at
another
store.
now
what
we
can
make
of
this?
the
blunting
of
the

to

is
identical.
you
can't
get

or

therefore,
that
if
a

that's
okay.
but

that's
correct.
mr.
bernard
dunau
then
you
have
section
7
which
incorporates
the
free
speech
protections
of
the
first
amendment.
it
is
basic
to
section
7.
what
the
congress
was
doing
in
section
7
was
to
say
to
employers,
you
can
not
abridge
the
right
to
self
organization.
what
is
self
organization?
it's
talking,
it's
speaking,
it's
assembling.
so,
we
have
congress
saying
that
you
mister
private
employer
will
not
abridge,
free
speech
when
it
is
exercised
by
union
representatives
and
we
declare
this
to
be
the
national
rule.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
sir,
the
first
amendment
applies
wherever
it
is
appropriate
to
exercise
the
right
of
free
speech.
in
logan
valley,
it
would
not
have
been
appropriate
to
enter
inside
of
the
store
and
picket
and
when
this
court
decided
logan
valley,
it
wasn't
deciding
that
you
could
enter
the
store
and
hand
bill
it
and
picket.
what
it
said,
was
given
the
exterior
of
the
store
and
the
coincidence
of
the
exterior
of
the
store
would
picketing
and
hand
billing,
you
can
not
prohibit
it
under
the
first
amendment.
if
you
cannot
prohibit
it
under
first
amendment
with
respect
to
state
action,
you
can
not
prohibit
it
under
section
7
with
respect
to
employer
action.
sometimes
it
seems
to
me,
we
need
to
get
right
back
to
the
basics.
the
basics
of
this
statute
as
recorded
on
page
23
of
our
brief,
the
right,
and
this
was
the
congress
--
the
report
of
the
senate
preceding
the
enactment
of
the
wagner
act.
the
right
of
self-organization
is
a
complex
whole,
embracing
the
various
elements
of
meetings,
speeches,
peaceful
picketing,
the
printing
and
distribution
of
pamphlets,
news
and
argument
all
of
which
however
are
traceable
to
the
fundamental
rights
of
expression
and
assembling.
so,
compound
that
the
right
of
self
organization
and
collective
bargaining
is
fundamental
being
one
phase
of
the
process
of
free
association
essential
to
the
democratic
way
of
life.
that
is
what
section
7
did.
that
is
why
the
first
amendment
is
relevant
because
congress
said,
“we
are
adopting
the
first
amendment
standard
in
section
7
and
the
advance
we
made
is
to
say
that
under
the
first
amendment
it
protects
against
state
action,
under
the
section
7
which
adopts
the
substance
of
the
first
amendment,
we
protect
against
private
employer
action.”
mr.
bernard
dunau
exactly
sir,
yes
sir.
by
virtue
of
section
7,
we
are
saying
that
what
a
policemen
is
forbidden
to
do
in
throwing
a
union
representative
off
a
parking
lot,
an
employers
forbidden
to
do.
what
a
state
is
forbidden
to
do
by
way
of
enjoining
free
speech
on
a
parking
lot,
an
employer
is
forbidden
to
do
via
section
7.
that
is
precisely
the
position
we
take.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
sir.
it
should
not
lead
me
to
say
that
babcock
is
wrong
because
logan
valley
rests
--
the
premise
of
logan
valley
is
the
openness
of
the
property.
in
babcock
and
wilcox,
you
were
not
dealing
with
open
property.
there
is
that
vital
distinction
between
whether
the
property
is
open
to
the
public
and
therefore,
an
appropriate
place
in
which
to
express
first
amendment
rights
to
talk,
as
against
where
the
property
is
close
and
therefore
may
not
inappropriate.
mr.
bernard
dunau
well,
if
i
may
say
so
your
honor,
there
has
been
a
suggestion
in
this
case.
it
stems
quite
properly
from
babcock
and
wilcox
that
there
are
somehow
less
rights
under
section
7
when
they
are
exercised
by
non-employees,
than
where
they
are
exercised
by
employees,
that
too
is
fundamentally
in
conflict
with
what
section
7
and
the
national
labor
relations
act
are
about.
mr.
bernard
dunau
but
it
made
it
in
a
case,
in
which
the
property
was
closed.
it
did
not
make
it
in
a
case
in
which
the
property
was
open.
mr.
bernard
dunau
alright
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
suppose
we
take
the
babcock
and
wilcox
standard
and
ignore
the
distinction
between
openness
and
close.
if
you
have
open
property
babcock
and
wilcox
says,
as
part
of
what
you
may
not
do,
you
may
not
discriminate.
now,
if
you
have
open
property
and
admit
every
element
of
that
public
which
has
a
message
which
wants
to
patronize
that
store,
which
wants
to
make
that
store
make
a
profit.
shoppers,
delivery
man,
everybody
under
the
sun
can
come
in.
but
you
close
that
open
property
to
the
union
representative
who
has
got
message
which
the
employer
doesn't
like,
that
is
discrimination.
that
is
inherent
discrimination.
mr.
bernard
dunau
the
inside
of
the
store?
mr.
bernard
dunau
the
inside
of
the
store.
mr.
bernard
dunau
sir,
there
is
a
functional
difference
between
what
you
can
do
inside
a
store
and
what
you
can
do
outside
of
the
store,
it's
based
on
the
use
to
which
the
property
is
put.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
think
this
court
will
say
it,
whenever
it
gets
a
first
amendment
case
in
which
an
employee
tries
to
picket
inside
the
store.
because
the
first
amendment
doesn't
speak
except
as
this
court
speaks
for
it.
now,
it
has
been
perfectly
clear
under
section
7
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
inside
and
outside
the
store,
a
distinction
which
applies
with
respect
to
employees
themselves
because,
it
is
a
store.
the
board
says
that
nobody,
no
employee,
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
non-employees,
no
employee
can
engage
in
union
solicitation
on
the
selling
area
of
the
floor
because
it
conduces
to
disruption.
mr.
bernard
dunau
you
did
your
honor
but...
mr.
bernard
dunau
all
it
does
is
being
back
a
spark
as
to
whether
you
could
or
could
not
eject
someone
from
the
library
but
i
just
don't
remember
well
enough
gentlemen.
mr.
bernard
dunau
inside
is
simply
not
the
same
thing
as
outside.
new
jersey
court
had
no
problem
making
a
distinction
with
respect
to
the
activities
of
students
and
teachers
saying
what
you
can
do
on
the
outside
is
not
the
same
thing
as
what
you
can
do
on
the
inside
because
of
the
difference
to
which
the
property
is
put.
it
seems
to
us
in
this
case,
one
should
get
down
to
saying
is
the
solicitation
on
that
parking
lot
inconsistent
with
the
operation
of
a
parking
lot
or
it
is
not.
no
one
suggesting,
you
can
inundate
that
parking
lot
with
50
organizers,
that's
congesting
it.
no
one
is
saying
you
cannot
require
an
identification
of
non-employees
coming
on
that
parking
lot.
all
we
are
saying
is
you
cannot
blanketly
prohibit
non-employees
on
a
parking
lot
otherwise
open.
the
two
other
elements
which
relevant
to
property.
use
is
not
being
disrupted.
a
right
of
privacy
--
well,
i
can't
imagine
anything
less
private
than
a
parking
lot.
i
think
we
are
capable
of
drawing
distinctions
between
one's
living
room
and
a
parking
lot,
and
what
you
have
left
therefore
is
the
man's
title
to
his
property,
what
he
can
do,
simply
because
he
owns
it
that
gets
back
to
make
a
title
i
had
thought
that
that
was
exactly
what
this
court
said
in
logan
valley
was
not
sufficient
on
the
part
of
a
storekeeper
when
on
the
other
side
you
had
suppression
of
speech
and
what
you
have
here
is
suppression
of
speech.
