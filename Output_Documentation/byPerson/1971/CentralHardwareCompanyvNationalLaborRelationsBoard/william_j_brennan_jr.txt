well,
i
suppose,
that
no
one
would
object
if
the
employee
crossed
the
parking
lot
in
order
to
go
to
work,
no
doubt.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
he
comes
reverently,
and
obediently
and
submissively,
but
he
comes
in
protest
then
he
can't
do
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
didn't
we
have
a
library
case
dealt
with
the
first
amendment
rights
inside
a
library?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
what
could
be
done?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
thought
we
made
it
to
the
distinction
there
between
exercising
first
amendment
rights
inside
which
would
be
parallel
of
which
you're
talking
about,
wouldn't
it?
it
is
done
inside
the
store.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
take
it
you
don't
fundamentally
disagree
with
mr.
dunau
that
section
7
applies
the
first
amendment
to
private
employees.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
which
event
logan
plaza
really
is
rather
irrelevant,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it's
really
just
an
excuse
to,
this
is
really
sort
of
a
some
background,
to
make
a
different
rule
in
this
kind
of
a
case
and
in
the
babcock
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
is
a
time
and
place
problem.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
you
apparently
agree
that
section
7
does
give
employees
and
organizers
and
unions
some
approach
to
a
place
like
this
that
non-labor
related
people
wouldn't
have.
say,
there
was
picketing
here
by
some
other
group.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
isn't
the
case
of
anybody
claiming
that
this
store
owner
is
subject
to
the
first
amendment.
this
is
a
case
you
submit
to
section
7.
