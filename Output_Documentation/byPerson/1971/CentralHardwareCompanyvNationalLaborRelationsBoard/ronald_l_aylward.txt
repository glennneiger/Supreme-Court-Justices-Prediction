mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
it's
my
pleasure
to
address
this
court
this
afternoon
and
tell
the
court
that
they
might
just
as
well
disregard
everything
that
my
co-counsel
just
said
because
in
presenting
the
issue
before
this
court,
the
eighth
circuit
has
stated
that
accessibility
is
really
not
too
important
and
really
the
board
and
the
eighth
circuit
is
under
our
mandate
from
this
court.
and
that's
logan
valley
decision
to
find
that
our
lots
are
free
standings,
single
store
lots
are
open
to
the
public.
now,
this
they
say,
is
the
crucial
issue
here,
is
whether
or
not
logan
valley
applies.
i
would
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
the
decision
where
they
say
that
the
basis
of
their
decision
is
other
than
mandate
of
logan
plaza,
we
hold
the
company's--
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
on
of
page
84
of
the
appendix
your
honor.
of
the
mandate
of
logan
valley
plaza,
we
hold
the
company's
non-employee,
no
solicitation
to
be
overly
broad
as
applied
to
its
parking
lots.
also,
in
the
brief
of
the
nlrb
before
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
quite
candidly
the
board
says,
it
should
be
noted
at
the
outset
to
the
contrary
to
the
company's
assertion
neither
the
trial
examiners
nor
the
board
rely
on
the
difficulty
of
access
to
the
employees
here
as
affording
an
independent
basis
for
the
finding
that
the
company's
rule
was
unlawfully
broad
rather
the
examiner
noted
that
while
the
question
of
whether
the
employees
are
otherwise
within
reasonable
reach
by
the
union
had
significance?
it
is
not
of
paramount
importance
in
this
case
and
the
case
of
parking
lots,
if
the
parking
lot
is
quasi-public
in
character.
so
to
again
the
nlrb
in
it's
brief
in
opposition
to
our
appearance
here,
they
say
the
only
issue
here
therefore
is
whether
the
board's
finding
that
the
company's
parking
lots
were
open
to
the
public
to
such
to
an
extent
to
render
the
situation
similar
to
that
in
logan
valley
is
supported
by
the
record.
therefore
gentlemen,
if
we're
able
to
prove
that
accessibility
is
important
and
that
there
is
an
alternate
means
of
communicating
with
these
employees,
then
i
think
the
board
is
going
to
be
hard
put
to
say
that
they
have
proved
inaccessibility
and
therefore
they
are
entitled
to
have
their
judgment
affirmed.
it
would
be
the
board's
position
and
it
is
the
board's
position
that
it
makes
no
difference
on
alternate
means
of
communication.
it
makes
no
difference
of
accessibility
and
as
far
as
discriminatory
application
of
this
rule,
it
really
makes
no
difference
either.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
the
board
in
it's
--
it
spent
4
pages
on
analyzing
a
decision
over
in
the
seventh
circuit,
its
own
decision
in
solo
cup
case.
and
in
that
case
it
relied
on
the
quasi-public
aspects
of
logan
valley.
it
only
gave
once
four
line
conclusion
in
our
case
when
they
arrived
at
the
decision
and
that
was
just
a
general
statement
that's
unsupported
by
anything
in
the
transcript
or
the
record.
it's
just
saying
that
they
held
and
we
maintain,
that's
unsupported
by
the
record
that
these
employees
were
inaccessible.
now,
it's
very
important
i
think
for
this
court
to
know
that
it's
been
the
long
standing
rule
in
labor
relations.
going
back
to
the
republic
aviation
case
that
certainly
employees
themselves
in
this
situation
and
even
inside
the
the
store
when
they
are
on
nonworking
time,
they
have
a
right
to
communicate
with
one
another
to
find
out
what
their
rights
are
as
a
far
whether
or
not
they
should
join
the
union
organization
etcetera.
now
as
mr.
mattern
had
pointed
out
even
after
our
decision
here
in
the
board
case,
the
board
has
gone
back
again
to
the
babcock
and
wilcox
case
in
situations
that
are
open
to
the
public
and
your
honor
the
(inaudible)
case,
and
the
(inaudible)
hotel
case,
those
are
open
to
the
public
and
there,
the
board
has
come
back
and
said,
it's
still
babcock
&
wilcox,
and
not
your
logan
valley.
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
yes
they
are.
now
we
would
maintain
that
quite
frankly,
if
you
are
dealing
with
coming
on
private
property,
you
probably
have
a
lot
better
rights
doing
it
over
under
section
7
than
you
have
over
getting
into
your
first
amendment
because
remember,
under
babcock
&
wilcox,
you
have
that
case,
you
have
the
case
of
a
person
as
unrelated
to
that
business
enterprise
coming
on
your
lot
solely
the
solicited
union
memberships
and
there
in
certain
situations,
where
you
have
the
inaccessibility,
you
don't
have
another
means
of
communicating
in
that
case,
the
board
says,
if
balancing
the
rights
of
the
(inaudible)
involve
the
employer
on
this
fifth
amendment
and
the
employee
on
this
section
7
in
this
first
amendment
right.
in
that
situation,
we
are
going
to
balance
it
and
say
that
the
employer
has
to
give
away
and
the
union
organizers
have
a
right
to
come
on
because
these
people
are
inaccessible
elsewhere.
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
let
me
see,
i
don't
have
the
petition.
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
what
page
your
honor?
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
a
20.
at
footnote
2
and
to
find
this
rule
is
unduly
brought,
took
in
consideration
that
there
were
no
reasonable
--
yes
your
honor,
they
commented
long
this
and
what
they
are
relying
on
--
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
in
this
footnote,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
well,
that's
what
we
--
what
we
are
here
for
because
we
don't
think
that
--
we
think
that
really
--
if
they
are
going
to
rely
on
anything,
they
should
rely
on
babcock
&
wilcox,
that
they
don't
have
a
--
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
yes
your
honor,
i
agree,
i
think
the
proper
precedent
here
is
the
babcock
&
wilcox
and
certainly,
they
should
not
be
relying
on
your
logan
valley.
i
don't
find
anything
wrong
with
logan
valley
situation.
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
the
position
is
i
think
we'd
want
it
because
i
think
under
babcock
&
wilcox,
these
people
have
to
come
on
and
they
have
the
burden
of
proof
and
certainly
we
don't.
we
shouldn't
be
the
ones
to
bring
out
in
the
argument
of
did
you
try
house
calls,
etcetera.
i
think
the
burden
of
is
on
them
to
show
it.
i
think
it's
--
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
yes
that's
right.
and
would
have
--
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
i
am
not
familiar
with
that
case
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
which
is
that
one?
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
yes,
yes
your
honor,
i
think
that
would
be
problem.
i
think
that's
a
problem
here
if
they
wouldn't
rely
on
babcock
&
wilcox.
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
no,
it
was
upheld
on
the
--
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
the
logan
valley,
that's
right
your
honor
and
we
maintained
that,
that's
a
misapplication
of
logan
valley.
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
yes
your
honor,
it's
kind
of
a
stretch
of
the
imagination
what
the
equation
would
be
the
court
here
relied
on
marsh
versus
alabama
in
which
i
think
it
clearly
should
have
and
they
said
the
chickasaw
mobile
suburb
was
equivalent
to
a
town
and
where
else
could
you
find
the
people
in
the
town
but
on
the
public
sideways
walks
down
in
front
of
the
store.
they
then
drew
that
equation
to
the
logan
valley
situation
and
there
they
compared
all
the
physical
attributes
--
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
well,
i
think
it's
a
--
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
well,
i
think
really,
it
doesn't
really
matter
what
we
call,
whether
we
call
it
first
amendment
rights
or
we
call
it
section
7
rights,
i
think
what
you
are
going
to
wind-up
in
both
situations,
what
you
would
wound
up
in
logan
valley
is
whether
or
not
those
pickets
could
reasonably
communicate
their
message
else
where
and
to
the
persons
to
whom
they
were
directed
and
in
that
case,
you
said,
although
if
they
were
directing
in
to
the
patrons
of
wise
market
and
where
else
could
you
find
the
patrons
of
wise
market
than
right
in
front
of
the
market's
place
and
the
court,
justice
marshall
want
to
extent
after
he
found
that,
he
said,
“now
let's
take
where
else
could
they
be?
could
they
go
of
on
to
the
berms
of
the
highway.”
and
he
ably
pointed
out
holding
up
the
sign
out
when
cars
are
going
by
35
miles
an
hour,
certainly
that's
not
a
reasonable
alternative
means
of
communication.
so
he
found
the
only
thing
he
could
find
and
that
is
the
proper
place
and
the
only
place
where
that
message
could
be
communicated
is
right
in
front
of
wise
market.
now
you
take
our
situation
where
you
have
the
union
organizers
coming
on
soliciting
membership
in
the
union
outlaw,
it's
my
opinion
that
we
have
proven
that
they
don't
have
the
right
to
come
on
our
lot
because
they
don't
have
to.
they
have
other
ways
of
communicating.
so
to
you
as
you
looked
at
the
berms
in
logan
valley,
look
at
the
house
calls,
the
meeting
calls,
the
telephone,
the
fact
that
these
people
had
a
list
of
our
employees,
80%
complete
with
names,
addresses,
telephone
numbers
and
job
description,
found
really
through
a
paid
organizer
that
we
put
on
our
payroll
that
was
getting
$150
a
week
also
being
paid
by
the
union
during
this
time
with
all
our
payrolls
specifically
for
that
purpose.
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
yes
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
these
people,
the
paid
insider
that
was
able
to
get
other
people
to
call
in
and
i
think
the
testimony
in
the
case
is
that
this
list
had
been
built
up
so
the
time
the
police
force
came
over
they
had
the
list.
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
there
is
no
evidence
one
way
or
another
in
the
--
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
well
that's
the
point
because
they
had
their
own
testimony
brought
up
by
mr.
mattern,
was
that
they
did
have
the
list
in
order
to
make
the
house
calls.
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
two
months
later.
your
honor,
that
there
is
no
testimony
in
the
record
of
when
the
list
--
the
list
was
being
formulated
over
the
period
of
time.
now,
if
we
are
going
to
look
at
logan
valley,
let's
look
to
see
what
the
court
distinguished
in
logan
valley.
now
in
logan
valley,
you
had
a
large
complex
of
sears
and
16
other
stores
on
a
single
privately
owned
tract
of
land.
central's
case,
we
own
our
own
parking
lot
and
we're
the
only
store
on
that
parking
lot.
the
parameter
of
logan
valley
was
1.1
miles.
now,
there
is
no
testimony
in
the
record,
how
many
acres
this
is
but
if
we
take
the
lloyd
versus
tanner
case,
that
comes
after
ours
here
and
there
is,
it
was
one-and-a-half
mile
parameter
and
that
was
about
50
acres.
so
i
would
assume
that
the
logan
valley
must
be
above
40
acres.
ours
is
approximately
five
acres
on
both
lots.
there
is
a
system
of
side
walks
in
logan
valley
plaza.
in
our
case,
there
are
no
sidewalks.
there
is
a
system
of
roadways.
in
our
case,
there
are
no
roadways.
the
parking
lots
on
logan
valley
are
commonly
shared
by
all
the
tenants
and
i
think
as
mattern
pointed
out,
ours
are
not
commonly
shared.
the
public
was
unrestricted
on
logan
valley.
there
is
no
testimony
in
there
as
far
as
i
can
determine
that
anyone
was
excluded
from
those
lots
and
yet
repeat
in
our
evidence
is
a
fact
that
we
have
consistently
controlled
our
parking
lots
for
our
customers.
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
yes
but
he
found
that,
your
honor,
in
our
contention,
not
based
upon
any
evidence
in
the
record.
he
found
that
on
no
evidence
in
the
record,
and
that's
our
contention.
judge
gibson
says
that
he
also
found
that
we
discriminatorily
apply
this
no
solicitation
rule
and
judge
gibson
in
the
eighth
circuit
said,
that
“this
is
taken
from
the
thin
air
and
is
devoid
effect.”
now
the
other
aspect
that
was
found
in
logan
valley
that
i
think
is
extremely
important
is
that,
that
was
the
record
shopping
center
of
the
community
--
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
no
your
honor,
in
fact
--
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
no,
i
don't
think
as
mr.
mattern
says,
it
was
mostly
used
strictly
by
our
customers
and
by
our
employees.
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
yes
the
only
evidence
in
the
record
is
a
fact
that
we
did
control
the
lot,
and
no
one
came
there
--
there
is
no
evidence
of
anybody
else
on
to
those
parking
lots
other
than
our
customers
and
employees.
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
yes,
the
record
is
repeat
where
we
have
everyone
that's
come
on
there
for
a
non-related
business
to
all
type
of
business.
the
customer
that
we've
excluded
your
honor.
i
think
it's
very
important
that
the
logan
valley
was
situation
was
one
where
--
it
was
classified
as
the
regular
shopping
center
for
the
community.
well,
certainly,
our
hardware
store,
parking
lot,
our
hardware
store
can't
be
classified
as
a
regular
shopping
center
of
the
community,
where
you
have
to
go
on
these
lots,
otherwise
where
you're
going
to
find
the
people?
the
definition,
i
think,
in
logan
valley
given
so
ably
by
justice
marshall
was,
a
suburban
shopping
center,
typically,
is
a
cluster
of
individual
retail
units
on
a
single
large
privately
owned
tract.
well
certainly,
if
justice
black
found
difficulty
in
equating
the
sidewalks
in
marsh
versus
alabama,
with
the
regular
shopping
center,
aspects
of
logan
valley.
imagine
what
his
difficulty
if
he
were
the
other
day
trying
to
equate
marsh
versus
alabama
with
our
single
store
parking
lots,
hardware
store.
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
not
on
our
life
and
your
honor,
we
don't
classify
it
as
the
center.
as
mr.
mattern
said,
over
in
the
east
store
situations,
we
had
a
fenced
in
car
wash
but
certainly
--
if
they
got
a
6
foot
high
fence
in
there,
they're
not
coming
on
our
parking
lot,
it
separates
it.
the
one
thing
that
mr.
mattern
did
leave
out
is
in
addition
to
the
service
station
on
the
car
being
separated
by
this
6-8
foot
ditch,
there
is
also
a
curve
line
that
we've
put
in
there,
some
6
to
8
inches
high
separating
them
from
it.
so
that's
all
you
have
on
the
east
store
parking
lot
entirely.
and
i
think
mr.
mattern
also
covered
the
physical
aspects
of
the
west
store.
thank
you.
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
alright,
let
me
give
you
the
case
of
people
versus
(inaudible).
and
the
fact
that
the
chief
justice
of
the
illinois,
supreme
court
justice
barenholtz
(ph)
who
admitted
viz-a-viz,
illinois
bar,
he
gave
that
decision.
what
happened
there,
the
same
union,
in
fact
the
same
attorney
that
represented
the
retail
clerks
in
that
state
represented
the
(inaudible)
in
that
case.
in
that
case,
they
said
under
babcock
&
wilcox,
we
have
a
right
to
come
on
a
sears
store
parking
lot
under
the
fifth
amendment,
i
mean
under
the
first
amendment.
there
the
illinois
supreme
court
says,
“no,
wait
a
minute.
it's
not
first
amendment,
if
you
guys
have
any
rights
or
union
organizers,
you
have
to
go
back
to
babcock
&
wilcox.
that
case
came
up
here
and
you
gentlemen
looked
at
it
and
you
denied
certiorari.
i
feel
like
the
old
judge
yesterday,
that
had
said
before
and
he
says
you
could
tell
us
--
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
yes
and
i
think
it
might.
as
far
as
the
appropriateness
of
the
place
to
give
the
right
of
free
speech,
i
think
this
court
also
in
the
adderley
case
that
we
quote
in
our
brief
versus
florida,
there
you
did
have,
you
had
state
property,
you
had
a
state
penitentiary,
you
had
people
coming
on
and
there
you
said,
this
isn't
the
appropriate
place.
gentlemen
i
submit
that
that
way
our
lots
aren't
the
appropriate
place.
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
i
don't
know
how
large
that
lot
was
your
honor.
all
i
know
is
we
have
--
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
well
five
acres
is
pretty
small
when
you
take
a
70,000
square
foot
store
on.
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
it's
my
pleasure
to
address
this
court
this
afternoon
and
tell
the
court
that
they
might
just
as
well
disregard
everything
that
my
co-counsel
just
said
because
in
presenting
the
issue
before
this
court,
the
eighth
circuit
has
stated
that
accessibility
is
really
not
too
important
and
really
the
board
and
the
eighth
circuit
is
under
our
mandate
from
this
court.
and
that's
logan
valley
decision
to
find
that
our
lots
are
free
standings,
single
store
lots
are
open
to
the
public.
now,
this
they
say,
is
the
crucial
issue
here,
is
whether
or
not
logan
valley
applies.
i
would
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
the
decision
where
they
say
that
the
basis
of
their
decision
is
other
than
mandate
of
logan
plaza,
we
hold
the
company's--
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
on
of
page
84
of
the
appendix
your
honor.
of
the
mandate
of
logan
valley
plaza,
we
hold
the
company's
non-employee,
no
solicitation
to
be
overly
broad
as
applied
to
its
parking
lots.
also,
in
the
brief
of
the
nlrb
before
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
quite
candidly
the
board
says,
it
should
be
noted
at
the
outset
to
the
contrary
to
the
company's
assertion
neither
the
trial
examiners
nor
the
board
rely
on
the
difficulty
of
access
to
the
employees
here
as
affording
an
independent
basis
for
the
finding
that
the
company's
rule
was
unlawfully
broad
rather
the
examiner
noted
that
while
the
question
of
whether
the
employees
are
otherwise
within
reasonable
reach
by
the
union
had
significance?
it
is
not
of
paramount
importance
in
this
case
and
the
case
of
parking
lots,
if
the
parking
lot
is
quasi-public
in
character.
so
to
again
the
nlrb
in
it's
brief
in
opposition
to
our
appearance
here,
they
say
the
only
issue
here
therefore
is
whether
the
board's
finding
that
the
company's
parking
lots
were
open
to
the
public
to
such
to
an
extent
to
render
the
situation
similar
to
that
in
logan
valley
is
supported
by
the
record.
therefore
gentlemen,
if
we're
able
to
prove
that
accessibility
is
important
and
that
there
is
an
alternate
means
of
communicating
with
these
employees,
then
i
think
the
board
is
going
to
be
hard
put
to
say
that
they
have
proved
inaccessibility
and
therefore
they
are
entitled
to
have
their
judgment
affirmed.
it
would
be
the
board's
position
and
it
is
the
board's
position
that
it
makes
no
difference
on
alternate
means
of
communication.
it
makes
no
difference
of
accessibility
and
as
far
as
discriminatory
application
of
this
rule,
it
really
makes
no
difference
either.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
the
board
in
it's
--
it
spent
4
pages
on
analyzing
a
decision
over
in
the
seventh
circuit,
its
own
decision
in
solo
cup
case.
and
in
that
case
it
relied
on
the
quasi-public
aspects
of
logan
valley.
it
only
gave
once
four
line
conclusion
in
our
case
when
they
arrived
at
the
decision
and
that
was
just
a
general
statement
that's
unsupported
by
anything
in
the
transcript
or
the
record.
it's
just
saying
that
they
held
and
we
maintain,
that's
unsupported
by
the
record
that
these
employees
were
inaccessible.
now,
it's
very
important
i
think
for
this
court
to
know
that
it's
been
the
long
standing
rule
in
labor
relations.
going
back
to
the
republic
aviation
case
that
certainly
employees
themselves
in
this
situation
and
even
inside
the
the
store
when
they
are
on
nonworking
time,
they
have
a
right
to
communicate
with
one
another
to
find
out
what
their
rights
are
as
a
far
whether
or
not
they
should
join
the
union
organization
etcetera.
now
as
mr.
mattern
had
pointed
out
even
after
our
decision
here
in
the
board
case,
the
board
has
gone
back
again
to
the
babcock
and
wilcox
case
in
situations
that
are
open
to
the
public
and
your
honor
the
(inaudible)
case,
and
the
(inaudible)
hotel
case,
those
are
open
to
the
public
and
there,
the
board
has
come
back
and
said,
it's
still
babcock
&
wilcox,
and
not
your
logan
valley.
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
yes
they
are.
now
we
would
maintain
that
quite
frankly,
if
you
are
dealing
with
coming
on
private
property,
you
probably
have
a
lot
better
rights
doing
it
over
under
section
7
than
you
have
over
getting
into
your
first
amendment
because
remember,
under
babcock
&
wilcox,
you
have
that
case,
you
have
the
case
of
a
person
as
unrelated
to
that
business
enterprise
coming
on
your
lot
solely
the
solicited
union
memberships
and
there
in
certain
situations,
where
you
have
the
inaccessibility,
you
don't
have
another
means
of
communicating
in
that
case,
the
board
says,
if
balancing
the
rights
of
the
(inaudible)
involve
the
employer
on
this
fifth
amendment
and
the
employee
on
this
section
7
in
this
first
amendment
right.
in
that
situation,
we
are
going
to
balance
it
and
say
that
the
employer
has
to
give
away
and
the
union
organizers
have
a
right
to
come
on
because
these
people
are
inaccessible
elsewhere.
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
let
me
see,
i
don't
have
the
petition.
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
what
page
your
honor?
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
a
20.
at
footnote
2
and
to
find
this
rule
is
unduly
brought,
took
in
consideration
that
there
were
no
reasonable
--
yes
your
honor,
they
commented
long
this
and
what
they
are
relying
on
--
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
in
this
footnote,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
well,
that's
what
we
--
what
we
are
here
for
because
we
don't
think
that
--
we
think
that
really
--
if
they
are
going
to
rely
on
anything,
they
should
rely
on
babcock
&
wilcox,
that
they
don't
have
a
--
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
yes
your
honor,
i
agree,
i
think
the
proper
precedent
here
is
the
babcock
&
wilcox
and
certainly,
they
should
not
be
relying
on
your
logan
valley.
i
don't
find
anything
wrong
with
logan
valley
situation.
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
the
position
is
i
think
we'd
want
it
because
i
think
under
babcock
&
wilcox,
these
people
have
to
come
on
and
they
have
the
burden
of
proof
and
certainly
we
don't.
we
shouldn't
be
the
ones
to
bring
out
in
the
argument
of
did
you
try
house
calls,
etcetera.
i
think
the
burden
of
is
on
them
to
show
it.
i
think
it's
--
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
yes
that's
right.
and
would
have
--
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
i
am
not
familiar
with
that
case
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
which
is
that
one?
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
yes,
yes
your
honor,
i
think
that
would
be
problem.
i
think
that's
a
problem
here
if
they
wouldn't
rely
on
babcock
&
wilcox.
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
no,
it
was
upheld
on
the
--
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
the
logan
valley,
that's
right
your
honor
and
we
maintained
that,
that's
a
misapplication
of
logan
valley.
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
yes
your
honor,
it's
kind
of
a
stretch
of
the
imagination
what
the
equation
would
be
the
court
here
relied
on
marsh
versus
alabama
in
which
i
think
it
clearly
should
have
and
they
said
the
chickasaw
mobile
suburb
was
equivalent
to
a
town
and
where
else
could
you
find
the
people
in
the
town
but
on
the
public
sideways
walks
down
in
front
of
the
store.
they
then
drew
that
equation
to
the
logan
valley
situation
and
there
they
compared
all
the
physical
attributes
--
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
well,
i
think
it's
a
--
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
well,
i
think
really,
it
doesn't
really
matter
what
we
call,
whether
we
call
it
first
amendment
rights
or
we
call
it
section
7
rights,
i
think
what
you
are
going
to
wind-up
in
both
situations,
what
you
would
wound
up
in
logan
valley
is
whether
or
not
those
pickets
could
reasonably
communicate
their
message
else
where
and
to
the
persons
to
whom
they
were
directed
and
in
that
case,
you
said,
although
if
they
were
directing
in
to
the
patrons
of
wise
market
and
where
else
could
you
find
the
patrons
of
wise
market
than
right
in
front
of
the
market's
place
and
the
court,
justice
marshall
want
to
extent
after
he
found
that,
he
said,
“now
let's
take
where
else
could
they
be?
could
they
go
of
on
to
the
berms
of
the
highway.”
and
he
ably
pointed
out
holding
up
the
sign
out
when
cars
are
going
by
35
miles
an
hour,
certainly
that's
not
a
reasonable
alternative
means
of
communication.
so
he
found
the
only
thing
he
could
find
and
that
is
the
proper
place
and
the
only
place
where
that
message
could
be
communicated
is
right
in
front
of
wise
market.
now
you
take
our
situation
where
you
have
the
union
organizers
coming
on
soliciting
membership
in
the
union
outlaw,
it's
my
opinion
that
we
have
proven
that
they
don't
have
the
right
to
come
on
our
lot
because
they
don't
have
to.
they
have
other
ways
of
communicating.
so
to
you
as
you
looked
at
the
berms
in
logan
valley,
look
at
the
house
calls,
the
meeting
calls,
the
telephone,
the
fact
that
these
people
had
a
list
of
our
employees,
80%
complete
with
names,
addresses,
telephone
numbers
and
job
description,
found
really
through
a
paid
organizer
that
we
put
on
our
payroll
that
was
getting
$150
a
week
also
being
paid
by
the
union
during
this
time
with
all
our
payrolls
specifically
for
that
purpose.
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
yes
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
these
people,
the
paid
insider
that
was
able
to
get
other
people
to
call
in
and
i
think
the
testimony
in
the
case
is
that
this
list
had
been
built
up
so
the
time
the
police
force
came
over
they
had
the
list.
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
there
is
no
evidence
one
way
or
another
in
the
--
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
well
that's
the
point
because
they
had
their
own
testimony
brought
up
by
mr.
mattern,
was
that
they
did
have
the
list
in
order
to
make
the
house
calls.
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
two
months
later.
your
honor,
that
there
is
no
testimony
in
the
record
of
when
the
list
--
the
list
was
being
formulated
over
the
period
of
time.
now,
if
we
are
going
to
look
at
logan
valley,
let's
look
to
see
what
the
court
distinguished
in
logan
valley.
now
in
logan
valley,
you
had
a
large
complex
of
sears
and
16
other
stores
on
a
single
privately
owned
tract
of
land.
central's
case,
we
own
our
own
parking
lot
and
we're
the
only
store
on
that
parking
lot.
the
parameter
of
logan
valley
was
1.1
miles.
now,
there
is
no
testimony
in
the
record,
how
many
acres
this
is
but
if
we
take
the
lloyd
versus
tanner
case,
that
comes
after
ours
here
and
there
is,
it
was
one-and-a-half
mile
parameter
and
that
was
about
50
acres.
so
i
would
assume
that
the
logan
valley
must
be
above
40
acres.
ours
is
approximately
five
acres
on
both
lots.
there
is
a
system
of
side
walks
in
logan
valley
plaza.
in
our
case,
there
are
no
sidewalks.
there
is
a
system
of
roadways.
in
our
case,
there
are
no
roadways.
the
parking
lots
on
logan
valley
are
commonly
shared
by
all
the
tenants
and
i
think
as
mattern
pointed
out,
ours
are
not
commonly
shared.
the
public
was
unrestricted
on
logan
valley.
there
is
no
testimony
in
there
as
far
as
i
can
determine
that
anyone
was
excluded
from
those
lots
and
yet
repeat
in
our
evidence
is
a
fact
that
we
have
consistently
controlled
our
parking
lots
for
our
customers.
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
yes
but
he
found
that,
your
honor,
in
our
contention,
not
based
upon
any
evidence
in
the
record.
he
found
that
on
no
evidence
in
the
record,
and
that's
our
contention.
judge
gibson
says
that
he
also
found
that
we
discriminatorily
apply
this
no
solicitation
rule
and
judge
gibson
in
the
eighth
circuit
said,
that
“this
is
taken
from
the
thin
air
and
is
devoid
effect.”
now
the
other
aspect
that
was
found
in
logan
valley
that
i
think
is
extremely
important
is
that,
that
was
the
record
shopping
center
of
the
community
--
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
no
your
honor,
in
fact
--
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
no,
i
don't
think
as
mr.
mattern
says,
it
was
mostly
used
strictly
by
our
customers
and
by
our
employees.
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
yes
the
only
evidence
in
the
record
is
a
fact
that
we
did
control
the
lot,
and
no
one
came
there
--
there
is
no
evidence
of
anybody
else
on
to
those
parking
lots
other
than
our
customers
and
employees.
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
yes,
the
record
is
repeat
where
we
have
everyone
that's
come
on
there
for
a
non-related
business
to
all
type
of
business.
the
customer
that
we've
excluded
your
honor.
i
think
it's
very
important
that
the
logan
valley
was
situation
was
one
where
--
it
was
classified
as
the
regular
shopping
center
for
the
community.
well,
certainly,
our
hardware
store,
parking
lot,
our
hardware
store
can't
be
classified
as
a
regular
shopping
center
of
the
community,
where
you
have
to
go
on
these
lots,
otherwise
where
you're
going
to
find
the
people?
the
definition,
i
think,
in
logan
valley
given
so
ably
by
justice
marshall
was,
a
suburban
shopping
center,
typically,
is
a
cluster
of
individual
retail
units
on
a
single
large
privately
owned
tract.
well
certainly,
if
justice
black
found
difficulty
in
equating
the
sidewalks
in
marsh
versus
alabama,
with
the
regular
shopping
center,
aspects
of
logan
valley.
imagine
what
his
difficulty
if
he
were
the
other
day
trying
to
equate
marsh
versus
alabama
with
our
single
store
parking
lots,
hardware
store.
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
not
on
our
life
and
your
honor,
we
don't
classify
it
as
the
center.
as
mr.
mattern
said,
over
in
the
east
store
situations,
we
had
a
fenced
in
car
wash
but
certainly
--
if
they
got
a
6
foot
high
fence
in
there,
they're
not
coming
on
our
parking
lot,
it
separates
it.
the
one
thing
that
mr.
mattern
did
leave
out
is
in
addition
to
the
service
station
on
the
car
being
separated
by
this
6-8
foot
ditch,
there
is
also
a
curve
line
that
we've
put
in
there,
some
6
to
8
inches
high
separating
them
from
it.
so
that's
all
you
have
on
the
east
store
parking
lot
entirely.
and
i
think
mr.
mattern
also
covered
the
physical
aspects
of
the
west
store.
thank
you.
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
alright,
let
me
give
you
the
case
of
people
versus
(inaudible).
and
the
fact
that
the
chief
justice
of
the
illinois,
supreme
court
justice
barenholtz
(ph)
who
admitted
viz-a-viz,
illinois
bar,
he
gave
that
decision.
what
happened
there,
the
same
union,
in
fact
the
same
attorney
that
represented
the
retail
clerks
in
that
state
represented
the
(inaudible)
in
that
case.
in
that
case,
they
said
under
babcock
&
wilcox,
we
have
a
right
to
come
on
a
sears
store
parking
lot
under
the
fifth
amendment,
i
mean
under
the
first
amendment.
there
the
illinois
supreme
court
says,
“no,
wait
a
minute.
it's
not
first
amendment,
if
you
guys
have
any
rights
or
union
organizers,
you
have
to
go
back
to
babcock
&
wilcox.
that
case
came
up
here
and
you
gentlemen
looked
at
it
and
you
denied
certiorari.
i
feel
like
the
old
judge
yesterday,
that
had
said
before
and
he
says
you
could
tell
us
--
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
yes
and
i
think
it
might.
as
far
as
the
appropriateness
of
the
place
to
give
the
right
of
free
speech,
i
think
this
court
also
in
the
adderley
case
that
we
quote
in
our
brief
versus
florida,
there
you
did
have,
you
had
state
property,
you
had
a
state
penitentiary,
you
had
people
coming
on
and
there
you
said,
this
isn't
the
appropriate
place.
gentlemen
i
submit
that
that
way
our
lots
aren't
the
appropriate
place.
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
i
don't
know
how
large
that
lot
was
your
honor.
all
i
know
is
we
have
--
mr.
ronald
l.
aylward
well
five
acres
is
pretty
small
when
you
take
a
70,000
square
foot
store
on.
