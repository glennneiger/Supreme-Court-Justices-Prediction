warren
e.

we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
70-223,
central
hardware
co.
against
the
labor
board.
mr.
mattern,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
aylward.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
page
are
you
on?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
you
put
people
off--?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you're
now
coming
into
your
rebuttal
time.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
come?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
to
at
least
part
of
it
judge
gibson
in
the
eight
circuit
said
there
was
an
absence
of
evidence
on
some
of
the
crucial
points.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
before
you
go
onto
that,
how
large
the
parking
lot
is
this,
how
many
cars
approximately--?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
many
would
you
say?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
come
you
just
said
that
the
parking
lot
by
its
very
nature
was
a
place
of
commotion
and
movement.
but
you
also
seem
to
suggest
they
are
having
nine
or
ten
union
organizers
on
the
parking
lot,
was
not
an
interference
with
the
owner's
use
of
his
private
property.
and
then
you
have
suggested
that
you
should
just
stop
the
individual
cases
of
interference
now.
what
do
you
mean,
hire
a
couple
of
security
officers
to
go
out
and
monitor
the
business
agents
of
the
union.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
else
would
you
do
it?
you
couldn't
do
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
should
he
have
to
do
that
on
tract
private
property;
a
property
that's
maintained
for
his
customers.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
you
make
that
--
do
you
raise
that
question
under
logan
valley
or
under
babcock.
i
am
still
not
sure
in
your
colloquy
with
mr.
justice
white
and
mr.
justice
brennan,
whether
you
do
or
do
not
rely
on
the
first
amendment.
at
one
time
i
thought
you
did,
and
later
it
seemed
that
you
had
abandoned
the
first
amendment.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
are
these
employees
who
were
trying
to
come
on
this
parking
lot
or
are
they
strangers?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
the
employees
crossing
that
lot
are
using
the
lot
for
the
precise
purpose
that
the
employer,
put
it
there,
is
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
told
us
that
the
that
about
more
or
less
a
100
parking
spaces
were
set
aside
by
the
employer
for
the
use
of
the
employees.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
come?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
go
ahead,
justice
blackmun.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
don't
think
so
because
i
think
that
if
they
were
to
do
that,
the
union
organizers
would
still
have
the
right
to
appear
--
try
to
reach
the
employees
on
the
public
portions
of
the
property
because
i
think
that
you
would
still
be
faced
with
the
problem
of
the
employer
who
has
opened
up
his
property
to
those
members
of
the
public
that
he
prefers
and
is
closed
it
to
another
segment
of
the
public
which
has
a
message
that
is
equally
as
germane
to
the
purpose
of
the
business.
i
don't
think
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
come.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
come
after
justice
blackmun's
fences
up
around
the
parking
lot
for
the
employees
with
appropriate
signs,
suppose
then
the
owner
builds
a
fence
around
the
entire
parking
area
and
puts
up
signs
for
customers
only,
non-customers
and
others
will
be
toed
away
at
the
expense
of
the
owner
of
the
car,
parking
lot
exclusively
for
customers
of
this
store,
now
what
kind
of
a
case
do
you
have
then?
you
think
the
union
organizers
specifically
can
go
in
and
in
face
of
that
and
disrupt
as
you
put
it
or
dislocate
the
parking
lot.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let's
just
say,
we
have
nine
or
ten
of
them
circulating
around
whatever
that
produces.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
these
signs
do?
what
do
the
signs
on
the
fence
do
to
the
logan
valley
aspect
of
the
case
or
the
babcock?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
suggesting
that
the
owner
of
the
store
can't
discriminate
between
customers
and
non-customers.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
come.
mr.
dunau.
we
have
invaded
your
time
a
little
bit
and
so
we'll
allow
you
the
full
amount
that
you
had
reserved
and
enlarge
your
friend's
time
accordingly.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
dunau,
go
back
to
your
illustration
about
introducing
state
action
by
virtue
of
having
the
policemen
them
out
and
suppose
the
owner
of
the
store
goes
out
and
personally
ejects,
then
you
haven't
any
state
action
i
suppose
you
would
agree.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
what
do
you
have?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
you
rest
that
on
the
free
speech
mr.
dunau.
then
could
have
the
nine
or
13
union
organizers
enter
the
store
and
move
all
around,
couldn't
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
the
first
amendment
only
an
outdoor
activity
or
it
is
inside
too?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
from
the
point
of
view
of
section
7,
what
difference
does
it
make,
if
your
argument
is
correct.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
employer
has
no
more
right
than
government
has
to.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
the
store
any
less
open
that
the
parking
lots?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
don't
you
invite
the
same
people
in?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
who
say
that?
does
the
constitution
or
some
statute
say
that
there
is
a
functional
difference
between
the
parking
lots?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
you
are
well
over
your
time
now.
thank
you.
mr.
mattern.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
thought
mr.
come
indicated
that
if
you
did
fence
it
in
and
put
all
these
restrictive
signs
on,
the
situation
might
be
different.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
we
are
not
sure,
whether
this
is
a
logan
valley
case
or
a
babcock
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
