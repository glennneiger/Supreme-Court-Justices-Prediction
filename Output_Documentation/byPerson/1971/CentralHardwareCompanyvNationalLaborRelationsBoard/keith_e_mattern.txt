mr.
keith
e.
mattern
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
reserving
10
minutes
of
our
40
minutes
to
rebuttal
on
this
case.
this
case
involves
central
hardware,
the
petitioner
barring
a
union
organizer
from
a
single
retail
stores
parking
lot
in
indianapolis
back
in
1968.
the
national
labor
relations
board
found
a
section
8
unfair
labor
practice
violation
for
this
act.
we
appealed
that
violation
to
the
eighth
circuit
on
the
basis
that
because
the
employees
were
reasonably
accessible
to
the
union
organizers
in
many
places
other
than
the
store's
parking
lots
that
this
court's
rule
of
national
labor
relation
board
v.
babcock
&
wilcox
controlled
and
therefore
the
board's
decision
should
have
been
reversed.
however,
the
eighth
circuit
found
that
because
central
had
opened
its
parking
lots
to
the
public
that
these
lots
had
become
quasi-public
in
nature
and
consequently,
this
court's
rule
in
logan
valley
applied.
we
feel
that
the
question
before
this
court
is
basically
in
the
situation
involving
a
union
organizer
coming
on
a
single
retail
stores
parking
lot.
do
the
rules
of
babcock
&
wilcox
apply,
or
do
the
rules
of
logan
valley
apply?
especially,
in
this
situation
where
the
organizer
comes
on
that
lot,
not
to
picket
or
do
anything
except
solicit
authorization
cards.
we
feel
there
are
two
main
issues
in
this
case.
the
first
issue
is
were
these
employees
accessible
to
those
union
organizers,
some
place
else
in
indianapolis
besides
our
parking
lots
and
i
will
discuss
that
and
how
it
applies
to
the
babcock
situation.
we
feel
the
second
aspect
of
this
case
is,
are
our
parking
lots
quasi-public
in
nature,
so
that
they
have
the
right
under
logan
valley
to
come
on
those
lots.
mr.
aylward
my
co-counsel,
will
discuss
the
quasi-public
aspect
and
why
logan
valley
in
this
case
does
not
apply.
now
that
as
you
can
probably
see
from
the
briefs,
the
facts
are
highly
disputed
as
far
as
the
briefs
go,
but
it's
our
position
that
these
facts
are
crystal
clear
as
far
this
record
goes.
the
facts
that
are
in
there
and
we
feel
that,
not
only
the
physical
characteristics
of
these
parking
lots
are
critical
in
this
case
but
we
feel
that
the
actual
facts
involving
the
union
organizer's
activities,
both
on
the
lots
and
their
lack
of
activities
away
from
the
lots
are
very
important.
there
are
two
stories
in
the
indianapolis.
there
is
one
on
the
east
side
of
town
and
one
on
the
west
side
of
the
town,
both
on
38th
street.
the
store
on
the
east
side
of
town
is
on
a
five
acre
tract.
it's
a
store
that
sits
on
a
back
side
of
the
tract
with
all
the
parking
lot
out
front,
face
is
on
the
main
street
here,
side
street
over
here.
on
one
side
of
the
of
the
east
store's
parking
lot,
there
is
a
car
wash.
it
has
a
six
foot
cyclone
fence
around
it.
on
the
other
side
of
the
east
store's
parking
lot
there
is
what
the
trial
examiner
refers
to
as
a
truck
service
station,
which
is
separated
from
the
east
store's
parking
lot
by
a
wide
muddy
strip,
we
would
like
to
refer
to,
as
a
ditch.
so
as
you
view
the
east
store
parking
lot,
it's
not
possible
to
go
from
any
other
parking
lot
on
to
central's
lot
or
to
go
from
central's
lot
on
to
any
other
parking
lot,
except
there
is
a
one
man
construction
office
down
the
access
road.
across
town
is
the
west
store.
now
the
west
store
looks
almost
exactly
like
the
east
store,
again
it's
about
a
5
acre
tract.
it
sits
on
the
back
part
of
the
parking
lot,
so
that
all
the
parking
is
out
front.
again,
there
is
a
busy
street
way
out
in
front
and
way
over
at
a
far
end
of
that
parking
lot,
there
is
a
mcdonald
hamburger
stand.
off
to
right
there
are
two
small
commercial
buildings,
they
have
their
own
parking
lot
between
them.
there
are
three
or
four
small
businesses
in
there
that
are
generally
we
describe
as
low
volume
--
not
low
volume,
but
don't
pull
many
customers
or
clients.
it's
such
things
as
a
small
loan
company,
and
inlaid
carpet
shop,
and
things
of
that
nature.
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
yes
sir.
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
no
sir,
there
is
a
curve
but,
there
is
access
between
the
two.
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
there
is
no
testimony
in
the
record,
your
honor,
but
i
would
have
to
say,
i
would
myself
probably
not
refer
to
it
as
a
low
traffic
place.
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
no
sir.
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
no
sir.
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
no,
sir.
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
the
record
is
replete
with
instances
where
they
have
been
members
of
the
public
who
came
on
to
parking
lot,
who
were
not
customers
and
these
people
were
uniformly,
throughout
the
entire
period
of
this
organizational
campaign
ejected.
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
no
sir.
there
was
a
man
who
wanted
to
open
his
own
photo
mat.
there
was
somebody
who
wanted
to
sell
christmas
trees,
there
were
somebody
who
want
to
have
a
petition
about
a
soldier
who
was
being
court
marshalled.
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
no
sir,
if
you
are
coming
as
a
customer
your
honor,
you
are
more
than
welcome.
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
no
sir.
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
no
sir,
it's
open
to
our
invited
customers.
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
no,
there
isn't
your
honor.
but
there
is
--
in
this
record
there
is
not
one
instance
of
anybody
coming
on
that
parking
lot
who
was
not
a
customer,
who
was
not
ejected
as
soon
as
he
was
discovered,
union
or
non-union.
now,
over
the
west
store,
even
with
these
two
commercial
buildings,
they
are
off
to
the
sides,
they
have
their
own
parking
lot,
the
testimony
in
the
record
is
that
there
are
never,
more
than
five
or
six
customers
in
that
area,
at
any
one
time.
now
all
of
the
tracts
involved
in
this
case,
all
of
these
tracts
of
ground,
the
car
wash,
the
mcdonalds,
all
of
these
have
been
built
by
different
people,
at
different
times.
each
maintains
its
own
lot.
it
repairs
its
own
lot,
there
is
not
apparent
concert
of
effort
to
attract
people
into
this
as
a
shopping
centers.
now
the
organizational
campaign
itself
began
on
may
21st
1968.
now
this
courts
rule
in
babcock
states
that
the
organizers
can
come
on
the
parking
lots,
only
if
the
employees
are
otherwise
so
inaccessible.
that
reasonable
efforts
to
communicate
with
him
through
the
usual
channels
of
communication
prove
ineffective.
now,
ineffective
in
this
situation
doesn't
mean
that
the
organizers
contacted
people
to
some
place
and
just
don't
get
the
authorization
cards
signed,
it
means
that's
ineffective
that
they
can't
even
get
to
them
because
of
the
location
of
their
homes,
in
relation
to
the
factory
or
the
place
they
work.
now,
with
the
background
of
babcock
in
mind,
i'd
like
to
review
how
this
organizational
campaign
was
actually
conducted.
the
campaign
started
on
may
21st,
1968
when
9
or
10
union
organizers
descended
on
to
the
west
store
parking
lot
with
what
the
eight
circuit
refers
to
as
a
blitz
campaign.
now,
this
campaign
was
obviously
designed
to
get
the
maximum
number
of
authorization
cards
signed
in
the
shortest
period
of
time.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
in
this
case
that
there
was
any
other
form
of
preparation
for
this
campaign
other
than
the
union
organizers.
however,
a
month
before
the
campaign
started,
the
union
had
gone
to
a
shop
store
at
the
krueger
(ph)
company
or
he
came
to
them.
however,
they
got
together.
he
took
a
leave
of
absence
from
the
krueger
(ph)
company
and
came
to
–
falsified
a
job
application,
came
to
central
hardware
and
got
one
of
the
new
jobs
at
our
west
store.
during
that
whole
period
of
the
month,
he
freely
admits
that
he
worked
on
getting
names,
addresses,
telephone
numbers
and
even
job
descriptions.
now,
in
this
record
there
is
no
evidence
of
any
other
form
of
attempt
to
contact
these
employees.
there
is
no
phone
calls,
no
letters
to
their
homes,
no
hand
billing,
no
use
of
newspapers.
they
didn't
even
invite
him
down
to
the
union
hall.
i've
never
heard
of
an
organizational
campaign
that
didn't
involve,
at
least
inviting
them
down
to
the
union
hall
or
to
some
other
meeting
place.
now,
the
director
of
organizing
himself
testified
that
home
calling
and
visiting
these
people
at
home
is
the
most
effective
form
of
organizing.
yet,
even
though
57%
of
our
employees
lived
within
5
miles
of
this
store,
74%
lived
within
10
miles,
there
the
board
presented
not
one
instance
of
home
calling
by
union
organizer.
i
was
the
only
one
who
presented
any
evidence
of
home
calling
and
that's
the
union
organizer
admitted
on
cross
examination
that
one
afternoon,
he'd
gone
out
with
a
list
of
50
or
60
people,
two
months
after
the
campaign
started
and
even
if
that,
he
must
have
gone
like
a
great
hunk
to
do
all
this
in
one
afternoon.
but
even
at
that
he
was
able
to
contact
20%
of
the
people
on
that
list.
yet
home
calling
wasn't
even
used
for
the
first
two
months
of
the
campaign
and
then
only
one
instance
in
this
record.
now,
as
we've
pointed
out,
in
the
brief
says
this,
as
this
campaign
progressed
on
the
parking
lot,
the
union's
tactics
became
progressively
so
gross
that
the
employees
started
coming
to
us.
not
a
few
employees
25,30,
a
hundred,
complaining
about
the
tactics
being
used
out
there,
the
harassment,
the
threats,
to
the
extent
that
we
had
no
choice
but
to
invoke
a
no
solicitation
rule
by
organizers
on
this
parking
lot.
it's
our
position
that
although
babcock
was
decided
back
in
1956
that
it's
still
the
law
now.
in
the
recent
cases
that
we
have
cited
in
the
briefs,
the
boards
own
monogram
models
case.
kutshers
hotel
and
(inaudible)
there
involved
resorts
that
were
open
to
the
public.
they
have
just
been
decided
by
the
second
or
third
circuits,
that
boards
and
the
courts
of
appeal
have
rigidly
been
enforcing
and
utilizing
babcock
in
these
same
situations.
it's
our
contention
that
on
this
basis
that
the
eighth
circuit
should
be
reversed
on
the
basis
that
babcock
should
have
been
applicable
rule.
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
no,
sir
i
can't
say
it
was,
your
honor.
well
it
wasn't
fenced.
i
can't
say
it
wasn't
open
to
the
public,
i
can't
say
it
was
closed
to
the
public.
thank
you.
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
just
outside
the
doors
your
honor?
it
took
place
all.
it
was
outside.
it
was
outside
the
doors,
it
was
over
there.
it
was
over
there.
there
were
nine
or
ten
of
them
out
there
on
the
same
lot.
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
no,
sir.
there
is
a
small
in
front
of
the
door
but
the
car
is
parked
right
up
to
the
the
buildings.
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
the
crucial
difference
here
when
you
talk
about
first
amendment,
you
talk
about
section
7,
i
think
when
you
look
at
logan
valley
and
you
look
at
babcock
and
wilcox,
you
got
to
say,
because
what
justice
marshall
have
to
look
in
finally
and
that
is
whether
or
not
the
message
that
to
be
given
in
logan
valley
by
this
picket
could
effectively
be
given
elsewhere,
and
in
course
he
said,
it
couldn't
be
effectively
given,
so
therefore
these
people
had
a
first
amendment
right,
and
justice
white,
i
think
you
very
correctly
stated
in
the
last
paragraph
of
the
logan
valley
decision,
that
as
far
as
you
know,
the
national
labor
relations
policy
does
not
require
this
free
speech
right,
that
they
have
it
under
section
7,
if
they
have
it
at
all.
when
we
get
over
under
section
7,
we
have
got
the
babcock
&
wilcox
case
and
the
same
final
issue
he
asserted
and
that
final
question
is,
can
that
message
be
given
elsewhere
other
than
coming
on
this
employer's
property
and
gentlemen,
i
submit
that
judge
gibson
on
page
80,
88,
89
and
90
of
our
appendix
was
the
only
one
that
found
the
facts
and
he
says,
“there
are
no
substantial
evidence
in
the
record
showing
that
the
employees
were
inaccessible
or
that
reasonable
attempts
to
communicate
with
them
were
ineffective”
and
he
goes
on
to
say,
“the
second
element
of
babcock
&
wilcox,
there
is
no
evidence
of
any
non-employee
solicitation
being
permitted
or
sanctioned
by
the
company.
this
finding
is
drawn
from
thin
air,
completely
devoid
of
factual
substantiation.”
now
gentlemen,
i
think
the
court
in
logan
valley
went
to
great
lengths
to
prove
the
governmental
aspects
of
that
logan
valley
shopping
center.
i
think
it's
very
important
that
you
saw
quite
a
bit
of
your
opinion
to
the
comparing
the
physical
attributes
of
that
shopping
center,
but
the
only
thing
you
didn't
find
similar
to
the
marsh
v.
alabama,
that
the
suburb
and
mobile
was
the
fact
that
there
in
marsh
that
people
that
only
town
also
owned
the
residences,
whereas
you
didn't
find
it
in
logan
valley.
so
if
we
are
to
accept
the
premise
that
the
board
would
have
us
now
find,
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
these
physical
characteristics
any
more.
all
you
have
to
find
is
something
like
a
vague
term
in
hoping
that
you've
invited
the
public
to
come
on
your
lots.
so
you
don't
have
to
have
all
these
physical
characteristics
any
longer.
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
no,
i
don't
have
any
problem
with
that.
i
think
that
what
the
board
does
in
--
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
yes,
it
is
your
honor.
the
same
question
you
have
to
ask
in
both
situations.
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
well,
i
think
we've
been
unjustly
put
upon
when
they
say
we
try
to
draw
the
difference
of
a
picket
having
a
superior
right
than
viewing
the
organizer
coming
on.
we
don't
draw
that
difference.
all
we're
saying
is
if
that
guy
wants
to
come
on
and
sell
membership
in
his
union
and
he
can
do
it
by
other
than
coming
on
our
lots,
then
he
should
do
it,
without
violating
our
rights.
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
there
is
a
time
and
place
and
that's
what
babcock
says.
babcock
says
you
look
at
the
residences
of
the
employees,
and
you
look
at
the
position
of
the
employer
and
as
long
as
you
can
find
alternate
means
and
as
long
as
you
can
find
the
no
solicitation
rule,
actively
enforced.
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
absolutely,
because
i
think
you
have
a
statute.
they
come
on
here
under
a
statutory
right
and
under
the
statute
the
board
has
balance,
and
this
case
as
looking
over
the
board's
shoulder,
you
say,
“alright
you've
done
right.
you
have
interpreted
the
act
properly.”
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
yes,
that's
what
we're
charged
with.
we're
charged
with
not
violating
first
amendment,
we're
charged
with
violating
section
7.
we
say
under
that
violation,
whether
it
be
you
apply
logan
valley
or
you
apply
the
babcock
&
wilcox,
you
got
to
look
and
ask
the
question,
where
did
these
people
get
that
message
and
what
is
the
message?
the
message
is
come
and
join
my
union.
now
certainly
if
they
can
go
to
their
homes
and
sell
it,
then
the
employees
under
all
the
rules
can
come
in
on
the
employer's
property
and
talk
among
themselves
and
say,
“we
think
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
join
this
union.
what
do
you
think
about
it?”
and
that's
all
that's
to
be
accomplished
under
our
labor
laws.
it's
for
these
employees
that
get
the
message
and
i
submit
that
they
can
get
this
message
without
coming
on
our
parking
lots
in
this
situation.
i
suggest
that
judge
gibson
says
there
is
no
evidence
of
our
lots
being
the
only
place
where
these
organizers
can
come
on
and
sell
memberships.
now
i
think
you
have
a
very
important
--
i
think
there
is
a
lot
of
people
looking
at
this
case
it
is
obvious
but
all
the
amicus
briefs
that
have
been
filed
because
i
think
if
you
do
find
that
our
lots
for
some
reason
are
open
to
public,
then
you've
got
thousands
and
thousands
of
other
free
standing
stores
that
provide
parking
in
front
of
their
stores
for
customers.
you'll
find
that
these
lots
are
now
going
to
be
embarked
on
and
divulged
by
all
of
the
union
organizers
and
who
else,
because
you
indicated
that
these
are
open
to
the
public.
now
as
far
as
a
buffer
zone
being
created
at
that
center,
i
don't
think
that's
important
because
i
think
that
--
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
i
don't
know
why
because
i
don't
see
how
he
can
overcome
the
question.
aren't
these
people
available,
or
can't
your
messages
shown
without
coming
on
lots,
whether
there
be
a
fence
there
or
what
have
you.
and
also
as
far
as
mr.
dunau's
situation
in
saying
if
you
hold
as
far
as
in
this
case
for
central
then
you
have
to
reverse
logan
valley.
i
don't
think
that.
i
think
logan
valley
stands
for
one
proposition
and
justice
marshall
said,
all
i'm
saying
here
in
this
case
in
logan
valley
is
that
we
got
physical
characteristics
similar
to
marsh
v.
alabama.
we
got
a
fact
that
it's
open
to
the
public,
nobody
has
been
restricted
from
the
shopping
center.
we
got
a
message
to
be
conveyed
and
that
is
that
wise
market
doesn't
pay
good
union
wages
and
we
got
whether
or
not
there
is
alternate
means
available
without
coming
in
front
of
the
store
and
that's
all
he
found
in
logan
valley
and
i
think
that's
good
law.
now
i
think
that
--
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
yes
and
probably
say
because
i
think
--
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
yeah,
that's
right.
i
think
judge,
you
went
to
great
lengths
in
your
first
footnote
in
logan
valley,
saying
we're
not
making
any
decision
under
the
nlra.
justice
black
in
the
same
way
in
his
dissent
he
says
neither
the
majority
nor
i
reach
any
the
decision
under
the
nlra
and
justice
white,
i'm
sorry
laughed,
but
i
think
he
hit
the
thing
right
on
the
head.
he
says
there
are
no
labor
rights
involved.
and
why
were
you
so
concerned
about
labor
rights
if
that
was
not
even
mentioned?
i'll
submit
because
the
board
submitted
amicus
brief
in
your
logan
valley.
it
might
be
worthwhile
taking
it
out
and
looking
at
it.
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
well,
i
don't
you
think
it
really
makes
any
difference
because
i
think
the
sole
criteria
in
both
cases
is
whether
you
get
the
message
across
some
where
else.
in
fact
that
just
goes
back
to
--
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
exactly
your
honor
because
--
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
where
is
it
more
appropriate
than
on
the
streets
and
on
the
sidewalks.
now
certainly
the
streets
and
sidewalks
in
logan
valley
weren't
any
different
than
marsh
v.
alabama.
but
there
are
a
heck
of
a
lot
different
than
our
free
standing
parking
lot.
now
i
think
that
gets
to
the
issue
of
what
mr.
dunau
says
is,
they
have
a
right
of
free
speech
where
appropriate
and
gentlemen,
i
submit,
they
do
have
a
right
of
free
speech
where
appropriate.
it
was
appropriate
under
the
right
of
free
speech
in
logan
valley
to
be
right
out
there
in
front
of
that
store
entrance
and
saying,
this
is
the
store
not
the
other
sixteen
that
are
involved,
but
it's
this
store
here
that
doesn't
pay
union
wages
and
that
was
the
appropriate
place.
but
in
our
case
where
is
it
appropriate?
it's
appropriate
if
you
can
find
them
elsewhere
then
go
to
their
homes,
their
own
men's
testified
the
best
place
to
get
across
the
union
message
is
by
house
calls.
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
and
this
is
what
babcock
tells
us.
babcock
says,
if
you
got
alternate
means
then
we
balance
the
rights
of
the
party.
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
the
very
same
kind.
that's
right.
the
house
calls,
the
advertise
in
the
newspaper,
the
union
meetings,
all
these,
your
honor,
they
didn't
even
try.
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
why
do
you
say
that
sir?
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
oh,
i
see.
under
what
rule?
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
in
our
case
it's
not
open
to
the
public
because
the
record
is
repeat
and
has
--
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
alright.
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
reserving
10
minutes
of
our
40
minutes
to
rebuttal
on
this
case.
this
case
involves
central
hardware,
the
petitioner
barring
a
union
organizer
from
a
single
retail
stores
parking
lot
in
indianapolis
back
in
1968.
the
national
labor
relations
board
found
a
section
8
unfair
labor
practice
violation
for
this
act.
we
appealed
that
violation
to
the
eighth
circuit
on
the
basis
that
because
the
employees
were
reasonably
accessible
to
the
union
organizers
in
many
places
other
than
the
store's
parking
lots
that
this
court's
rule
of
national
labor
relation
board
v.
babcock
&
wilcox
controlled
and
therefore
the
board's
decision
should
have
been
reversed.
however,
the
eighth
circuit
found
that
because
central
had
opened
its
parking
lots
to
the
public
that
these
lots
had
become
quasi-public
in
nature
and
consequently,
this
court's
rule
in
logan
valley
applied.
we
feel
that
the
question
before
this
court
is
basically
in
the
situation
involving
a
union
organizer
coming
on
a
single
retail
stores
parking
lot.
do
the
rules
of
babcock
&
wilcox
apply,
or
do
the
rules
of
logan
valley
apply?
especially,
in
this
situation
where
the
organizer
comes
on
that
lot,
not
to
picket
or
do
anything
except
solicit
authorization
cards.
we
feel
there
are
two
main
issues
in
this
case.
the
first
issue
is
were
these
employees
accessible
to
those
union
organizers,
some
place
else
in
indianapolis
besides
our
parking
lots
and
i
will
discuss
that
and
how
it
applies
to
the
babcock
situation.
we
feel
the
second
aspect
of
this
case
is,
are
our
parking
lots
quasi-public
in
nature,
so
that
they
have
the
right
under
logan
valley
to
come
on
those
lots.
mr.
aylward
my
co-counsel,
will
discuss
the
quasi-public
aspect
and
why
logan
valley
in
this
case
does
not
apply.
now
that
as
you
can
probably
see
from
the
briefs,
the
facts
are
highly
disputed
as
far
as
the
briefs
go,
but
it's
our
position
that
these
facts
are
crystal
clear
as
far
this
record
goes.
the
facts
that
are
in
there
and
we
feel
that,
not
only
the
physical
characteristics
of
these
parking
lots
are
critical
in
this
case
but
we
feel
that
the
actual
facts
involving
the
union
organizer's
activities,
both
on
the
lots
and
their
lack
of
activities
away
from
the
lots
are
very
important.
there
are
two
stories
in
the
indianapolis.
there
is
one
on
the
east
side
of
town
and
one
on
the
west
side
of
the
town,
both
on
38th
street.
the
store
on
the
east
side
of
town
is
on
a
five
acre
tract.
it's
a
store
that
sits
on
a
back
side
of
the
tract
with
all
the
parking
lot
out
front,
face
is
on
the
main
street
here,
side
street
over
here.
on
one
side
of
the
of
the
east
store's
parking
lot,
there
is
a
car
wash.
it
has
a
six
foot
cyclone
fence
around
it.
on
the
other
side
of
the
east
store's
parking
lot
there
is
what
the
trial
examiner
refers
to
as
a
truck
service
station,
which
is
separated
from
the
east
store's
parking
lot
by
a
wide
muddy
strip,
we
would
like
to
refer
to,
as
a
ditch.
so
as
you
view
the
east
store
parking
lot,
it's
not
possible
to
go
from
any
other
parking
lot
on
to
central's
lot
or
to
go
from
central's
lot
on
to
any
other
parking
lot,
except
there
is
a
one
man
construction
office
down
the
access
road.
across
town
is
the
west
store.
now
the
west
store
looks
almost
exactly
like
the
east
store,
again
it's
about
a
5
acre
tract.
it
sits
on
the
back
part
of
the
parking
lot,
so
that
all
the
parking
is
out
front.
again,
there
is
a
busy
street
way
out
in
front
and
way
over
at
a
far
end
of
that
parking
lot,
there
is
a
mcdonald
hamburger
stand.
off
to
right
there
are
two
small
commercial
buildings,
they
have
their
own
parking
lot
between
them.
there
are
three
or
four
small
businesses
in
there
that
are
generally
we
describe
as
low
volume
--
not
low
volume,
but
don't
pull
many
customers
or
clients.
it's
such
things
as
a
small
loan
company,
and
inlaid
carpet
shop,
and
things
of
that
nature.
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
yes
sir.
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
no
sir,
there
is
a
curve
but,
there
is
access
between
the
two.
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
there
is
no
testimony
in
the
record,
your
honor,
but
i
would
have
to
say,
i
would
myself
probably
not
refer
to
it
as
a
low
traffic
place.
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
no
sir.
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
no
sir.
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
no,
sir.
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
the
record
is
replete
with
instances
where
they
have
been
members
of
the
public
who
came
on
to
parking
lot,
who
were
not
customers
and
these
people
were
uniformly,
throughout
the
entire
period
of
this
organizational
campaign
ejected.
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
no
sir.
there
was
a
man
who
wanted
to
open
his
own
photo
mat.
there
was
somebody
who
wanted
to
sell
christmas
trees,
there
were
somebody
who
want
to
have
a
petition
about
a
soldier
who
was
being
court
marshalled.
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
no
sir,
if
you
are
coming
as
a
customer
your
honor,
you
are
more
than
welcome.
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
no
sir.
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
no
sir,
it's
open
to
our
invited
customers.
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
no,
there
isn't
your
honor.
but
there
is
--
in
this
record
there
is
not
one
instance
of
anybody
coming
on
that
parking
lot
who
was
not
a
customer,
who
was
not
ejected
as
soon
as
he
was
discovered,
union
or
non-union.
now,
over
the
west
store,
even
with
these
two
commercial
buildings,
they
are
off
to
the
sides,
they
have
their
own
parking
lot,
the
testimony
in
the
record
is
that
there
are
never,
more
than
five
or
six
customers
in
that
area,
at
any
one
time.
now
all
of
the
tracts
involved
in
this
case,
all
of
these
tracts
of
ground,
the
car
wash,
the
mcdonalds,
all
of
these
have
been
built
by
different
people,
at
different
times.
each
maintains
its
own
lot.
it
repairs
its
own
lot,
there
is
not
apparent
concert
of
effort
to
attract
people
into
this
as
a
shopping
centers.
now
the
organizational
campaign
itself
began
on
may
21st
1968.
now
this
courts
rule
in
babcock
states
that
the
organizers
can
come
on
the
parking
lots,
only
if
the
employees
are
otherwise
so
inaccessible.
that
reasonable
efforts
to
communicate
with
him
through
the
usual
channels
of
communication
prove
ineffective.
now,
ineffective
in
this
situation
doesn't
mean
that
the
organizers
contacted
people
to
some
place
and
just
don't
get
the
authorization
cards
signed,
it
means
that's
ineffective
that
they
can't
even
get
to
them
because
of
the
location
of
their
homes,
in
relation
to
the
factory
or
the
place
they
work.
now,
with
the
background
of
babcock
in
mind,
i'd
like
to
review
how
this
organizational
campaign
was
actually
conducted.
the
campaign
started
on
may
21st,
1968
when
9
or
10
union
organizers
descended
on
to
the
west
store
parking
lot
with
what
the
eight
circuit
refers
to
as
a
blitz
campaign.
now,
this
campaign
was
obviously
designed
to
get
the
maximum
number
of
authorization
cards
signed
in
the
shortest
period
of
time.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
in
this
case
that
there
was
any
other
form
of
preparation
for
this
campaign
other
than
the
union
organizers.
however,
a
month
before
the
campaign
started,
the
union
had
gone
to
a
shop
store
at
the
krueger
(ph)
company
or
he
came
to
them.
however,
they
got
together.
he
took
a
leave
of
absence
from
the
krueger
(ph)
company
and
came
to
–
falsified
a
job
application,
came
to
central
hardware
and
got
one
of
the
new
jobs
at
our
west
store.
during
that
whole
period
of
the
month,
he
freely
admits
that
he
worked
on
getting
names,
addresses,
telephone
numbers
and
even
job
descriptions.
now,
in
this
record
there
is
no
evidence
of
any
other
form
of
attempt
to
contact
these
employees.
there
is
no
phone
calls,
no
letters
to
their
homes,
no
hand
billing,
no
use
of
newspapers.
they
didn't
even
invite
him
down
to
the
union
hall.
i've
never
heard
of
an
organizational
campaign
that
didn't
involve,
at
least
inviting
them
down
to
the
union
hall
or
to
some
other
meeting
place.
now,
the
director
of
organizing
himself
testified
that
home
calling
and
visiting
these
people
at
home
is
the
most
effective
form
of
organizing.
yet,
even
though
57%
of
our
employees
lived
within
5
miles
of
this
store,
74%
lived
within
10
miles,
there
the
board
presented
not
one
instance
of
home
calling
by
union
organizer.
i
was
the
only
one
who
presented
any
evidence
of
home
calling
and
that's
the
union
organizer
admitted
on
cross
examination
that
one
afternoon,
he'd
gone
out
with
a
list
of
50
or
60
people,
two
months
after
the
campaign
started
and
even
if
that,
he
must
have
gone
like
a
great
hunk
to
do
all
this
in
one
afternoon.
but
even
at
that
he
was
able
to
contact
20%
of
the
people
on
that
list.
yet
home
calling
wasn't
even
used
for
the
first
two
months
of
the
campaign
and
then
only
one
instance
in
this
record.
now,
as
we've
pointed
out,
in
the
brief
says
this,
as
this
campaign
progressed
on
the
parking
lot,
the
union's
tactics
became
progressively
so
gross
that
the
employees
started
coming
to
us.
not
a
few
employees
25,30,
a
hundred,
complaining
about
the
tactics
being
used
out
there,
the
harassment,
the
threats,
to
the
extent
that
we
had
no
choice
but
to
invoke
a
no
solicitation
rule
by
organizers
on
this
parking
lot.
it's
our
position
that
although
babcock
was
decided
back
in
1956
that
it's
still
the
law
now.
in
the
recent
cases
that
we
have
cited
in
the
briefs,
the
boards
own
monogram
models
case.
kutshers
hotel
and
(inaudible)
there
involved
resorts
that
were
open
to
the
public.
they
have
just
been
decided
by
the
second
or
third
circuits,
that
boards
and
the
courts
of
appeal
have
rigidly
been
enforcing
and
utilizing
babcock
in
these
same
situations.
it's
our
contention
that
on
this
basis
that
the
eighth
circuit
should
be
reversed
on
the
basis
that
babcock
should
have
been
applicable
rule.
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
no,
sir
i
can't
say
it
was,
your
honor.
well
it
wasn't
fenced.
i
can't
say
it
wasn't
open
to
the
public,
i
can't
say
it
was
closed
to
the
public.
thank
you.
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
just
outside
the
doors
your
honor?
it
took
place
all.
it
was
outside.
it
was
outside
the
doors,
it
was
over
there.
it
was
over
there.
there
were
nine
or
ten
of
them
out
there
on
the
same
lot.
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
no,
sir.
there
is
a
small
in
front
of
the
door
but
the
car
is
parked
right
up
to
the
the
buildings.
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
the
crucial
difference
here
when
you
talk
about
first
amendment,
you
talk
about
section
7,
i
think
when
you
look
at
logan
valley
and
you
look
at
babcock
and
wilcox,
you
got
to
say,
because
what
justice
marshall
have
to
look
in
finally
and
that
is
whether
or
not
the
message
that
to
be
given
in
logan
valley
by
this
picket
could
effectively
be
given
elsewhere,
and
in
course
he
said,
it
couldn't
be
effectively
given,
so
therefore
these
people
had
a
first
amendment
right,
and
justice
white,
i
think
you
very
correctly
stated
in
the
last
paragraph
of
the
logan
valley
decision,
that
as
far
as
you
know,
the
national
labor
relations
policy
does
not
require
this
free
speech
right,
that
they
have
it
under
section
7,
if
they
have
it
at
all.
when
we
get
over
under
section
7,
we
have
got
the
babcock
&
wilcox
case
and
the
same
final
issue
he
asserted
and
that
final
question
is,
can
that
message
be
given
elsewhere
other
than
coming
on
this
employer's
property
and
gentlemen,
i
submit
that
judge
gibson
on
page
80,
88,
89
and
90
of
our
appendix
was
the
only
one
that
found
the
facts
and
he
says,
“there
are
no
substantial
evidence
in
the
record
showing
that
the
employees
were
inaccessible
or
that
reasonable
attempts
to
communicate
with
them
were
ineffective”
and
he
goes
on
to
say,
“the
second
element
of
babcock
&
wilcox,
there
is
no
evidence
of
any
non-employee
solicitation
being
permitted
or
sanctioned
by
the
company.
this
finding
is
drawn
from
thin
air,
completely
devoid
of
factual
substantiation.”
now
gentlemen,
i
think
the
court
in
logan
valley
went
to
great
lengths
to
prove
the
governmental
aspects
of
that
logan
valley
shopping
center.
i
think
it's
very
important
that
you
saw
quite
a
bit
of
your
opinion
to
the
comparing
the
physical
attributes
of
that
shopping
center,
but
the
only
thing
you
didn't
find
similar
to
the
marsh
v.
alabama,
that
the
suburb
and
mobile
was
the
fact
that
there
in
marsh
that
people
that
only
town
also
owned
the
residences,
whereas
you
didn't
find
it
in
logan
valley.
so
if
we
are
to
accept
the
premise
that
the
board
would
have
us
now
find,
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
these
physical
characteristics
any
more.
all
you
have
to
find
is
something
like
a
vague
term
in
hoping
that
you've
invited
the
public
to
come
on
your
lots.
so
you
don't
have
to
have
all
these
physical
characteristics
any
longer.
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
no,
i
don't
have
any
problem
with
that.
i
think
that
what
the
board
does
in
--
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
yes,
it
is
your
honor.
the
same
question
you
have
to
ask
in
both
situations.
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
well,
i
think
we've
been
unjustly
put
upon
when
they
say
we
try
to
draw
the
difference
of
a
picket
having
a
superior
right
than
viewing
the
organizer
coming
on.
we
don't
draw
that
difference.
all
we're
saying
is
if
that
guy
wants
to
come
on
and
sell
membership
in
his
union
and
he
can
do
it
by
other
than
coming
on
our
lots,
then
he
should
do
it,
without
violating
our
rights.
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
there
is
a
time
and
place
and
that's
what
babcock
says.
babcock
says
you
look
at
the
residences
of
the
employees,
and
you
look
at
the
position
of
the
employer
and
as
long
as
you
can
find
alternate
means
and
as
long
as
you
can
find
the
no
solicitation
rule,
actively
enforced.
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
absolutely,
because
i
think
you
have
a
statute.
they
come
on
here
under
a
statutory
right
and
under
the
statute
the
board
has
balance,
and
this
case
as
looking
over
the
board's
shoulder,
you
say,
“alright
you've
done
right.
you
have
interpreted
the
act
properly.”
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
yes,
that's
what
we're
charged
with.
we're
charged
with
not
violating
first
amendment,
we're
charged
with
violating
section
7.
we
say
under
that
violation,
whether
it
be
you
apply
logan
valley
or
you
apply
the
babcock
&
wilcox,
you
got
to
look
and
ask
the
question,
where
did
these
people
get
that
message
and
what
is
the
message?
the
message
is
come
and
join
my
union.
now
certainly
if
they
can
go
to
their
homes
and
sell
it,
then
the
employees
under
all
the
rules
can
come
in
on
the
employer's
property
and
talk
among
themselves
and
say,
“we
think
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
join
this
union.
what
do
you
think
about
it?”
and
that's
all
that's
to
be
accomplished
under
our
labor
laws.
it's
for
these
employees
that
get
the
message
and
i
submit
that
they
can
get
this
message
without
coming
on
our
parking
lots
in
this
situation.
i
suggest
that
judge
gibson
says
there
is
no
evidence
of
our
lots
being
the
only
place
where
these
organizers
can
come
on
and
sell
memberships.
now
i
think
you
have
a
very
important
--
i
think
there
is
a
lot
of
people
looking
at
this
case
it
is
obvious
but
all
the
amicus
briefs
that
have
been
filed
because
i
think
if
you
do
find
that
our
lots
for
some
reason
are
open
to
public,
then
you've
got
thousands
and
thousands
of
other
free
standing
stores
that
provide
parking
in
front
of
their
stores
for
customers.
you'll
find
that
these
lots
are
now
going
to
be
embarked
on
and
divulged
by
all
of
the
union
organizers
and
who
else,
because
you
indicated
that
these
are
open
to
the
public.
now
as
far
as
a
buffer
zone
being
created
at
that
center,
i
don't
think
that's
important
because
i
think
that
--
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
i
don't
know
why
because
i
don't
see
how
he
can
overcome
the
question.
aren't
these
people
available,
or
can't
your
messages
shown
without
coming
on
lots,
whether
there
be
a
fence
there
or
what
have
you.
and
also
as
far
as
mr.
dunau's
situation
in
saying
if
you
hold
as
far
as
in
this
case
for
central
then
you
have
to
reverse
logan
valley.
i
don't
think
that.
i
think
logan
valley
stands
for
one
proposition
and
justice
marshall
said,
all
i'm
saying
here
in
this
case
in
logan
valley
is
that
we
got
physical
characteristics
similar
to
marsh
v.
alabama.
we
got
a
fact
that
it's
open
to
the
public,
nobody
has
been
restricted
from
the
shopping
center.
we
got
a
message
to
be
conveyed
and
that
is
that
wise
market
doesn't
pay
good
union
wages
and
we
got
whether
or
not
there
is
alternate
means
available
without
coming
in
front
of
the
store
and
that's
all
he
found
in
logan
valley
and
i
think
that's
good
law.
now
i
think
that
--
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
yes
and
probably
say
because
i
think
--
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
yeah,
that's
right.
i
think
judge,
you
went
to
great
lengths
in
your
first
footnote
in
logan
valley,
saying
we're
not
making
any
decision
under
the
nlra.
justice
black
in
the
same
way
in
his
dissent
he
says
neither
the
majority
nor
i
reach
any
the
decision
under
the
nlra
and
justice
white,
i'm
sorry
laughed,
but
i
think
he
hit
the
thing
right
on
the
head.
he
says
there
are
no
labor
rights
involved.
and
why
were
you
so
concerned
about
labor
rights
if
that
was
not
even
mentioned?
i'll
submit
because
the
board
submitted
amicus
brief
in
your
logan
valley.
it
might
be
worthwhile
taking
it
out
and
looking
at
it.
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
well,
i
don't
you
think
it
really
makes
any
difference
because
i
think
the
sole
criteria
in
both
cases
is
whether
you
get
the
message
across
some
where
else.
in
fact
that
just
goes
back
to
--
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
exactly
your
honor
because
--
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
where
is
it
more
appropriate
than
on
the
streets
and
on
the
sidewalks.
now
certainly
the
streets
and
sidewalks
in
logan
valley
weren't
any
different
than
marsh
v.
alabama.
but
there
are
a
heck
of
a
lot
different
than
our
free
standing
parking
lot.
now
i
think
that
gets
to
the
issue
of
what
mr.
dunau
says
is,
they
have
a
right
of
free
speech
where
appropriate
and
gentlemen,
i
submit,
they
do
have
a
right
of
free
speech
where
appropriate.
it
was
appropriate
under
the
right
of
free
speech
in
logan
valley
to
be
right
out
there
in
front
of
that
store
entrance
and
saying,
this
is
the
store
not
the
other
sixteen
that
are
involved,
but
it's
this
store
here
that
doesn't
pay
union
wages
and
that
was
the
appropriate
place.
but
in
our
case
where
is
it
appropriate?
it's
appropriate
if
you
can
find
them
elsewhere
then
go
to
their
homes,
their
own
men's
testified
the
best
place
to
get
across
the
union
message
is
by
house
calls.
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
and
this
is
what
babcock
tells
us.
babcock
says,
if
you
got
alternate
means
then
we
balance
the
rights
of
the
party.
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
the
very
same
kind.
that's
right.
the
house
calls,
the
advertise
in
the
newspaper,
the
union
meetings,
all
these,
your
honor,
they
didn't
even
try.
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
why
do
you
say
that
sir?
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
oh,
i
see.
under
what
rule?
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
in
our
case
it's
not
open
to
the
public
because
the
record
is
repeat
and
has
--
mr.
keith
e.
mattern
alright.
