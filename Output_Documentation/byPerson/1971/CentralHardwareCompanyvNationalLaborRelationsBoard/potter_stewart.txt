justice
potter
stewart
would
you
complain
to
have
the
solicitation
then
just
outside
the
entrance
doors
to
your
east
and
the
west
doors
rather
than
in
parking
lot?
justice
potter
stewart
well
in
fact,
mr.
aylward,
didn't
the
board
do
that
in
this
footnote
2
at
page
a
20
of
the
petition.
justice
potter
stewart
i
am
looking
at
the
board's
opinion
which
they
say,
they
have
a
footnote,
footnote
2.
you
have
a
board's
opinion,
there
i
have
a
petition
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
page
a
20.
justice
potter
stewart
what
i
am
really
getting
at
is,
didn't
they
find
that
this
was
--
this
really
showed
within
babcock
&
wilcox
in
that
footnote
at
least?
justice
potter
stewart
then
why
in
heaven's
name
are
they
relying
on
logan
valley
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it's
not
whether
they
have
to
but
i
can't
understand,
well
i
should
ask
them
i
guess
something.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
i
had
--
if
this
were
presented
only
as
a
babcock
case,
what
would
your
position
be?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
wouldn't
be
faced
with
that
finding?
justice
potter
stewart
would
that
present,
a
universal
camera
problem
for
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
universal
camera
surely
you
are.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
on
the
scope
of
review
of
a
board
finding
in
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
it's
the
basis
on
which
this
court
was
upheld?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
upheld
on
logan
valley
--
justice
potter
stewart
even
if
it's
relying
on
logan
valley,
i
think
it
is
that
if
it's
public
and
that
if
it
takes
if
it's
--
if
you
can
fairly
say
that
the
facility
must
be
treated
as
part
of
the
government
as
subject
to
the
first
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
was
the
parking
lot
here
posted?
justice
potter
stewart
and
did
the
public
use
it
generally?
justice
potter
stewart
what
i
am
saying,
but
it
supposed
to
be
done
whether
it
was
actually
a
fact.
justice
potter
stewart
am
i
right
that
the
footnote
2
of
page
20
is
based
on
the
babcock
finding?
justice
potter
stewart
may
i
ask
this
mr.
come?
justice
potter
stewart
since
you
have
an
enforcement
order
--
justice
potter
stewart
if
this
is
sustainable
under
babcock,
are
you
entitled
of
affirmance
without
reference
to
the
logan
valley?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
if
we
agreed
with
them
on
the
logan
valley
ground,
in
order
to
go
back
for
them
then
to
reconsider
it
on
the
babcock
ground.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
in
other
words,
unless
we
would
decide.
justice
potter
stewart
we're
not
waiting
for
camera
--
is
that
under
universal
camera?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
what
universal
camera
actually
require
us
to
make
the
rule.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
come,
just
for
the
whole
purpose
that
you're
going
into
these
facts
to
the
horizon
to
demonstrate
this,
because
the
parking
lot
is
open
to
the
public
and
because
of
the
facts
about
the
parking
lot,
the
owner
of
the
parking
lot
must
be
treated
as
an
official.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
going
to
have
to
subject
it
to
the
first
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
logan
valley
was
a
first
amendment
case,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
could
the
first
amendment
apply
to
just
any
private
person?
justice
potter
stewart
this
sounds
like
the
other
leg
of
your
argument,
babcock?
justice
potter
stewart
but
suppose
if
the
parking
lot
is
open
to
the
public,
then
what
follows
in
terms
of
logan
valley
in
the
first
amendment,
does
the
first
amendment
come
into
play
every
time
you
run
into
a
parking
lot
that
is
so-called
open
to
the
public
in
front
of
the
retail
establishment?
does
that
retail
operator
subject
himself
to
the
first
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
why
isn't
that
babcock,
right?
of
course
it
is.
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
the
principle
of
babcock
is
a
very
balancing
test
you're
talking
about.
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
section
7
and
property
right.
well,
then
you
don't
ever
have
to
get
to
the
first
amendment,
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
that
isn't
what
the
eighth
circuit
did
use,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
first
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
more
than
that
because
people
who
are
working
there
are
the
people
involved
in
this
controversy.
justice
potter
stewart
so
whether
i
label
that
babcock
or
not,
the
point
is
that
your
insistence
is
that
just
balancing,
is
what
the
eighth
circuit
did,
and
enforcing
the
board's
order,
it's
entitled
to
affirmance
on
that
ground.
justice
potter
stewart
they
can
forget
all
about
the
first
amendment
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
or
is
it
just
mr.
come,
you've
to
got
establish
at
least
for
me,
you've
got
to
persuade
me
that's
what
the
eighth
circuit
did.
justice
potter
stewart
or
they
had
a
spy
on
the
payroll
of
the
company,
didn't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
getting
full
time
pay
for
union
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
getting
full
time
pay
from
the
company,
and
the
company
didn't
know
that
he
was
an
union
employee.
now
maybe
he
spies
over;
over
--
but
they
did
have
an
agent,
a
paid
union
agent
and
an
employee
of
the
company.
justice
potter
stewart
just
to
make
it
clear
what's
the
board's
position
is,
with
respect
to
parking
lot,
i
take
it
and
what
the
trial
examiner
said
that
whatever
he
said
was
adopted
by
the
board.
he
said
in
footnote
15
on
page
23,
of
the
record.
however,
whether
or
not
respondent
stores
are
in
a
shopping
center
is
immaterial,
in
as
much
as
the
board
in
(inaudible)
equated
a
single
store
parking
lot
to
the
shopping
center
parking
lot.
so
the
board's
position
in
this
case
and
others
is
that
whenever
you
have
a
parking
lot
that
is
serving
in
a
retail
store,
even
though
it's
a
single
store,
a
single
parking
lot,
that
the
babcock
rule
does
not
apply.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
board's
position.
justice
potter
stewart
if
you
have
a
parking
lot
then
you
have
a
different
situation
than
babcock.
justice
potter
stewart
you
just
simply
have
the
different
factor
to
put
in
the
balance
when
you
have
a
public
parking
lot,
that
when
you
had
attempts
to
isolated
parking
lots
at
a
plane.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
makes
a
different
balance
between
inaccessibility
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
a
burden
on
the
parking
lot.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
thought,
if
these
had
been
employees,
you
have
republic
aviation,
then
you
wouldn't
even
be
here?
justice
potter
stewart
these
are
non-employees,
are
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
a
constitutional
decision,
and
it
had
to
rest
upon
a
finding,
that
the
people
who
suppressed
that
demonstration
was
equivalent
of
government
or
else
it
could
not
have
been
a
constitutional
decision.
justice
potter
stewart
have
you
read
the
first
and
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
as
far
as
section
7
goes,
you
wouldn't
make
it
difficult,
it
was
an
employee
or
employee's
representative.
justice
potter
stewart
the
public
got
away
from
babcock
and
logan
plaza.
justice
potter
stewart
although
i
must
say
that,
babcock
is
not
mentioned
in
anyone
of
the
four,
five
opinions
that
is
written.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
coextensive,
even
apart
from
governmental
and
private
action,
it
doesn't
--
section
7
doesn't
get
into
the
area
of
the
part
of
obscenity,
for
example.
justice
potter
stewart
but
there
was
a
very
big
difference
you've
already
mentioned
that
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
protect
against
governmental
action
in
section
7
is
a
statutory
right
as
against
an
employer.
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
you
are
relying
on
section
7,
i
don't
see
what
difference
it
makes
whether
it's
open
or
closed
from
the
point
of
view
of
your
argument
under
section-7?
justice
potter
stewart
the
whole
point
of
course
in
logan
valley
in
showing
the
public
characteristics
and
attributes
of
that
shopping
center
was
to
make
it
equivalent
of
the
company
town
in
marsh
against
alabama
in
which
in
turn
it
had
decided
that
the
company
town
is
like
any
--
like
a
municipal,
convectional
municipal
town
and
therefore
is
a
state
within
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
return
incorporates
the
free
speech
protections
of
the
first
amendment.
since
it
was
a
constitutional
decision,
it
was
a
basic
key
and
foundation
of
the
logan
valley
decision
to
show
that
it
would
see
equivalent
of
the
city
itself.
that
was
really
nothing
to
do
with
section
7.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
it
does
make
a
difference
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
would
you
complain
to
have
the
solicitation
then
just
outside
the
entrance
doors
to
your
east
and
the
west
doors
rather
than
in
parking
lot?
justice
potter
stewart
well
in
fact,
mr.
aylward,
didn't
the
board
do
that
in
this
footnote
2
at
page
a
20
of
the
petition.
justice
potter
stewart
i
am
looking
at
the
board's
opinion
which
they
say,
they
have
a
footnote,
footnote
2.
you
have
a
board's
opinion,
there
i
have
a
petition
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
page
a
20.
justice
potter
stewart
what
i
am
really
getting
at
is,
didn't
they
find
that
this
was
--
this
really
showed
within
babcock
&
wilcox
in
that
footnote
at
least?
justice
potter
stewart
then
why
in
heaven's
name
are
they
relying
on
logan
valley
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it's
not
whether
they
have
to
but
i
can't
understand,
well
i
should
ask
them
i
guess
something.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
i
had
--
if
this
were
presented
only
as
a
babcock
case,
what
would
your
position
be?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
wouldn't
be
faced
with
that
finding?
justice
potter
stewart
would
that
present,
a
universal
camera
problem
for
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
universal
camera
surely
you
are.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
on
the
scope
of
review
of
a
board
finding
in
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
it's
the
basis
on
which
this
court
was
upheld?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
upheld
on
logan
valley
--
justice
potter
stewart
even
if
it's
relying
on
logan
valley,
i
think
it
is
that
if
it's
public
and
that
if
it
takes
if
it's
--
if
you
can
fairly
say
that
the
facility
must
be
treated
as
part
of
the
government
as
subject
to
the
first
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
was
the
parking
lot
here
posted?
justice
potter
stewart
and
did
the
public
use
it
generally?
justice
potter
stewart
what
i
am
saying,
but
it
supposed
to
be
done
whether
it
was
actually
a
fact.
justice
potter
stewart
am
i
right
that
the
footnote
2
of
page
20
is
based
on
the
babcock
finding?
justice
potter
stewart
may
i
ask
this
mr.
come?
justice
potter
stewart
since
you
have
an
enforcement
order
--
justice
potter
stewart
if
this
is
sustainable
under
babcock,
are
you
entitled
of
affirmance
without

so
that

well,
in

unless

would

justice
potter
stewart
we're
not
waiting
for
camera
--
is
that
under
universal

justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
what
universal
camera
actually
require
us
to
make
the
rule.
justice

stewart
mr.
come,
just
for
the
whole

that
you're

must
be

justice
potter
stewart
you're
going
to
have
to
subject
it
to
the
first
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
logan
valley
was
a
first
amendment
case,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
could
the
first
amendment
apply
to
just
any
private
person?
justice

stewart
this
sounds

that

well
i
thought,
if
these
had
been
employees,
you
have
republic
aviation,
then
you
wouldn't
even
be
here?
justice
potter
stewart
these
are
non-employees,
are
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
a
constitutional
decision,
and
it
had
to
rest
upon
a
finding,
that
the
people
who
suppressed
that
demonstration
was
equivalent
of
government
or
else
it
could
not
have
been
a
constitutional
decision.
justice
potter
stewart
have
you
read
the
first
and
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
as
far
as
section
7
goes,
you
wouldn't
make
it
difficult,
it
was
an
employee
or
employee's
representative.
justice
potter
stewart
the
public
got
away
from
babcock
and
logan
plaza.
justice
potter
stewart
although
i
must
say
that,
babcock
is
not
mentioned
in
anyone
of
the
four,
five
opinions
that
is
written.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
coextensive,
even
apart
from
governmental
and
private
action,
it
doesn't
--
section
7
doesn't
get
into
the
area
of
the
part
of
obscenity,
for
example.
justice
potter
stewart
but
there
was
a
very
big
difference
you've
already
mentioned
that
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
protect
against
governmental
action
in
section
7
is
a
statutory
right
as
against
an
employer.
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
you
are
relying
on
section
7,
i
don't
see
what
difference
it
makes
whether
it's
open
or
closed
from
the
point
of
view
of
your
argument
under
section-7?
justice
potter
stewart
the
whole
point
of
course
in
logan
valley
in
showing
the
public
characteristics
and
attributes
of
that
shopping
center
was
to
make
it
equivalent
of
the
company
town
in
marsh
against
alabama
in
which
in
turn
it
had
decided
that
the
company
town
is
like
any
--
like
a
municipal,
convectional
municipal
town
and
therefore
is
a
state
within
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
return
incorporates
the
free
speech
protections
of
the
first
amendment.
since
it
was
a
constitutional
decision,
it
was
a
basic
key
and
foundation
of
the
logan
valley
decision
to
show
that
it
would
see
equivalent
of
the
city
itself.
that
was
really
nothing
to
do
with
section
7.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
it
does
make
a
difference
