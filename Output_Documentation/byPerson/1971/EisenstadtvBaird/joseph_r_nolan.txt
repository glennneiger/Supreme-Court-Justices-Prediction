mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
case
comes
to
this
court
on
an
appeal
from
the
first
circuit
the
court
of
appeals.
this
court
noted
probable
jurisdiction
on
march
1st,
1971.
the
case
started
factually
on
april
6th
of
1967,
when
the
appellee
mr.
baird,
addressed
group
of
people,
mostly
students
at
boston
university,
pursuant
to
an
invitation.
approximately
2,000
people
were
in
attendance.
at
that
time,
mr.
baird
used
to
give
a
demonstration
boards
in
his
lecture
on
“contraception.”
these
demonstration
boards
had
various
contraceptive
devices
and
alongside
of
the
lectern,
there
was
a
cotton
box
filled
with
various
other
contraceptive
devices.
after
the
lecture,
he
invited
the
people
to
come
to
the
lectern,
and
in
grab
bag
fashion,
take
what
they
wish
from
this
cotton.
he
then,
i
repeat
it
was
after
the
lecture,
he
then
handed
a
can
of
emko,
an
admittedly
contraceptive
device
to
a
young
lady.
now,
i
do
want
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention,
an
inaccuracy
in
the
appellant’s
brief,
in
the
reference
made
to
this
young
lady
as
being
unmarried.
the
record
does
not
indicate
nor
did
the
commonwealth
at
this
time
introduce
evidence
tending
to
show
that
she
was
unmarried.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
it
is
not
significant
however
to
the
case.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
page
four
on
the
statement
of
the
case,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
it
is
not
however,
significant
to
the
case,
but
i
do
want
to
point
out
the
inaccuracy
and
the
correction
made
by
mr.
balliro
in
his
brief,
the
original
brief,
is
well
taken.
repeatedly
doing
the
lecture,
the
appellee,
mr.
baird,
invited
the
police
to
arrest
him.
he
said,
“why
do
not
you
arrest
me
officers,
i
am
violating
your
massachusetts
law?”
finally,
when
he
handed
this
can
of
emko
to
this
particular
young
lady,
the
police
complied
with
his
wishes.
now,
the
appellee
was
charged
in
two
indictments
returned
by
the
suffolk
county
grand
jury,
for
the
violation
of
massachusetts
general
law,
chapter
272,
section
21
which
among
other
things
prohibits
the
giving
away
and
the
exhibition
of,
to
use
the
words
of
the
statute,
articles
intended
for
the
prevention
of
conception.
after
the
trial
in
suffolk
superior
court,
jury
waived
he
was
found
guilty
and
the
trial
judge
reported
the
case
to
the
supreme
judicial
court.
one
indictment
charged,
the
defendant
with
exhibiting
contraceptive
devices
in
violation
of
the
statute
and
the
other
charged
him
with
the
giving
away.
now,
there
are
other
words
in
there
which
are
not
important
to
us
such
as
selling,
lending
and
so
forth.
two
words
that
are
important,
are
exhibiting
and
giving
away.
the
supreme
judicial
court
reversed
the
conviction
of
that
under
the
indictment
charging
him
with
exhibiting
because
in
its
opinion,
it
clearly
violated
his
first
amendment
rights,
particularly
the
freedom
of
speech
right.
however,
by
divided
court,
he
had
sustained
the
conviction
under
the
indictment
charging
the
giving
away
of
the
can
of
emko.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
yes
because
i
was
going
to
call
the
court's
attention
in
a
moment
that
both
statutes
on
pages
two
and
three
should
be
read
together.
chapter
272,
section
20
which
is
the
prohibition
statute
and
chapter
272.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
yes.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
he
was
not
a
physician.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
yeah.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
if
this
girl,
and
it
would
be
at
this
point
only
that
it
would
be
significant
as
to
whether
she
was
married,
he
would
not
be
prosecuted,
certainly
if
she
were
a
married
woman.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
yes,
because
well,
many
helped
themselves.
in
this
particular
instance,
he
gave
this
girl
the
emko.
i
do
not
suppose
it
would
be
silly
of
me
to
say
that
he
was
administering
to,
in
the
way
a
doctor
would
in
handing
it
to
her.
well,
it
certainly
is
not
that.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
the
doctor-patient
relationship,
yes.
the
trial
court
then
sentenced
the
defendant
to
three
months
in
health
correction,
stayed
that
sentence
pending
appeal
to
the
supreme
judicial
court
and
a
further
stay
was
granted
while
a
petition
for
certiorari
was
addressed
to
this
court
to
the
supreme
judicial
court
and
was
denied
and
mr.
baird
then
started
serving
his
three
months
and
i
believe
he
served
34
or
35
days
of
that.
when
the
second
court
of
appeals,
and
i
am
getting
ahead
of
myself,
in
addressing
himself
to
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
to
the
district
court,
the
district
court
i
might
say
denied
the
petition
for
the
writ,
second
court
of
appeals,
for
the
first
circuit
issued
a
stay
for
a
probable
cause
and
released
the
appellee
on
bail
since
he
had
served,
i
believe
34
or
35
days
of
his
sentence.
this
case
then
is
in
the
posture
of
appeal
directly
from
that
order
of
the
first
circuit,
and
i
would
add
that
in
both
cases,
the
district
court
judge
filed
an
opinion
which
we
find
in
the
appendix,
and
of
course
the
circuit
court
filed
an
opinion.
now,
there
are
two
questions
that
i
think
are
addressed
to
this
court,
and
the
first
is,
whether
the
massachusetts
statute,
and
when
i
say
statute,
of
course
i
must
include
a
reading
together
of
the
two,
whether
or
not
the
massachusetts
statute
prohibiting
it,
the
giving
away
of
admittedly
contraceptive
substance,
whether
or
not
that
is
constitutional.
and
secondly,
whether
or
not
the
massachusetts
statute
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
william
baird,
who
was
admittedly
a
married
man
and
who
was
admittedly
also
not
a
physician
nor
a
nurse
nor
a
registered
pharmacist
or
clearly
not
a
public
health
agency.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
the
second
question
first
and
that
is,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
william
baird
has
standing
to
raise
this
question.
now,
he
is
admittedly
a
married
man.
he
is
in
effect
asking
this
court,
and
even
cursive
reading
of
the
brief
i
think
indicates
this,
he
is
asking
this
court
to
declare
unconstitutional
a
statute
as
it
applies
to
others
because
clearly
his
constitutional
rights
are
not
invaded.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
yes,
he
is.
i
do
not
believe
--
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
well,
it
is
my
understanding
that
merely
because
he
was
in
jail,
does
not
give
him
a
tailor
made
standing
as
the
way
you
(voice
overlap).
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
yes.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
i
am
suggesting
that
he
does
not
have
standing
as
we
know
standing
simply
because
he
was
convicted
of
the
statute.
now,
perhaps,
mr.
justice
brennan,
you
are
saying
to
me
well,
anytime
there
is
a
first
amendment
problem
here,
he
does
not
have
to
have
the
kind
of
standing,
but
i
am
a
little
ahead
of
myself,
but
i
do
not
believe
that
he
has
first
amendments
--
first
amendment
rights
here.
i
do
not
see
where
his
rights
have
been
invaded.
i
do
not
see
where
his
wife's
rights
have
been
invaded.
both
of
them
can
seek
and
receive
contraceptive
devices
within
the
framework
of
massachusetts
law.
i
think
the
language
in
the
raines
case
is
clearly
opposite
here,
where
this
court
said
that
the
rule
that
one
to
whom
application
of
a
statute
is
constitutional,
will
not
be
had
to
attack
it
because
it
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
somebody
else.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
well,
i
would
--
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
i
would
say
he
has
standing
there,
if
as
a
basis
for
saying
that,
the
right
to
be
a
physician
or
the
right,
the
accompanying
right
is
the
first
amendment
right.
but,
i
do
not
see
that
--
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
in
answer
to
you
well
mr.
justice,
what
i
would
say
that
he
would
have
no
more
standing,
he
has
no
more
standing
here
than
if
he
went
to
practice
medicine,
was
arrested
for
the
illegal
practice
of
medicine
and
then
say
well,
that
statute
is
unconstitutional,
i
do
not
think
that
this
court
would
say
that
he
had
standing
because
the
practice
of
medicine
is
not
a
first
amendment
right
as
such
for
a
man
who
is
obviously
not
(voice
overlap)
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
well,
the
other
grounds
that
he
is
talking
about,
mainly
due
process,
i
will
take
in
a
moment,
but
the
due
process
that
he
is
talking
about
is
some
right
of
privacy.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
there
is
no
problem
with
that
at
all.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
well,
i
would
say
i
think
it
is
trenchantly
different,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it
is
trenchantly
different
because
from
--
and
i
hope
that
the
court
will
see
from
our
brief
that
there
are
some
very
dangerous
sidelights
and
side
effects
to
the
use
of
many
contraceptives
and
i
think
an
examination,
i
am
ahead
of
myself,
but
i
think
an
examination
of
the
senate
committee
on
monopoly
when
the
pill
was
being
examined.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
well,
i
must
need
to
go
the
merits.
i
think
to
answer
your
wheat
germ
example,
that
is
all.
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
a
good
analogy.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
well,
i
think
he
may
think
so,
but
i
do
not
believe
that
he
is
thinking
this.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
no,
i
do
not
believe
you
do.
no,
i
believe
that,
that
has
to
be
taken
with
respect
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
itself.
but
i
do
believe
that
there
is
a
serious
problem
here
in
standing
because
he
himself
and
his
wife
are
not
prevented
from
the
benefits
of
the
massachusetts
statute
in
receiving
contraceptives
or
being
prescribed
contraceptives.
there
is
no
right
of
privacy
involved
here
with
him.
this
is
not
a
griswold
situation
who
he
keeps
speaking
about
a
right
of
privacy
for
example,
but
it
is
not
his
right
of
privacy.
i
think
the
district
court
judge
said
that
more
eloquently
than
i
did
in
his
opinion.
he
said
in
effect
and
i
am
just
paraphrasing,
it
is
in
the
record
and
he
said
that
we
would
hear
mr.
baird
if
his
right
of
privacy,
but
he
is
asking,
you
to
hear
him
with
respect
to
the
right
of
privacy
of
the
unmarried
for
example,
and
i
do
not
believe
that
he
has
standing
to
do
that.
it
is
interesting
to
take
his
brief
and
just
some
of
the
head
notes
i
think
are
interesting
on
page
five.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
no
reasonable
relation
to
the
excise
of
his
power.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
i
raised
the
first
amendment
mr.
justice
brennan,
only
in
response
to
the
question
of
standing.
this
court
has
said
that
a
person
would
have
standing
which
he
otherwise
does
not
have.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
well,
of
course
the
first
circuit
found
that
he
did
have
standing.
this
is
i
suppose
--
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
yes.
that
is
right.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
that
is
right.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
yes,
i
am
stoutly
contenting
that
he
does
not
have
standing
for
the
very
reason
that
he
does
not
have
a
first
amendment
freedom
or
right
involved
here.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
well,
on
page
eight.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
he
was
first
abstinence
for
example
on
page
eight,
it
says
it
is
an
abstinence
somatic
answer.
he
refers
to
maternal
mortality
on
page
nine,
or
infant
mortality,
but
it
is
not,
i
repeat
open
to
him.
again,
he
purports
to
be
the
voice
of
somebody
else
in
this
particular
question.
he
is
asking
you
to
overrule
or
to
strike
the
statute
because
the
statute
effects
other
people
not
him.
health
characteristics
on
page
10,
the
unwanted
child
and
so
forth.
i
repeat,
i
think
that
he
does
not
have
in
the
stricter
sense
the
standing
that
he
should
have
here
to
raise
these
other
related
questions
whatever,
i
am
not
questioning
the
various
findings
and
the
statistics
that
he
has
in
the
brief,
that
is
not
my
point.
now,
to
come
to
the
first
question
which
is
raised,
and
namely
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
itself,
it
prohibits
among
other
things,
a
person
who
is
not
a
doctor
reading
the
statutes
together
from
giving
away
and
it
prohibits
a
person
who
is
not
a
nurse
or
a
registered
pharmacist
giving
any
advice
or
information.
i
think
it
is
critically
important
at
this
juncture
to
examine
what
the
issue
is
not.
you
are
not
being
called
upon
in
this
case
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
statute
making
it
crime
to
use
a
contraceptive
would
be
unconstitutional
because
use
is
certainly
not
prohibited.
you
are
not
being
asked
to
rule
on
the
wisdom
of
the
legislature
in
prohibiting
because
i
suggest
respectfully
that
is
beyond
the
power
of
this
court
is
to
whether
or
not
it
is
wise
for
the
massachusetts
legislature
to
have
it.
you
will
certainly
not
sit
as
a
super
legislature
to
determine
whether
it
is
wise
to
do
it.
you
are
not
being
asked
to
determine
whether
or
not
contraception
is
per
se
evil
or
in
violation
of
the
natural
law.
though,
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
certainly
the
statute
was
enacted
in
1879,
clearly
a
public
morality
statute
and
while
for
the
last
few
years,
there
has
been
a
solid
attack
on
the
question
of
the
natural
law
or
whether
or
not
it
is
violative,
still
some
--
few
of
us
who
believe
it
is
also
against
the
natural
law,
but
that
is
not
the
issue.
you
are
not
being
called
upon
to
determine
the
intrinsic
evil
of
contraception.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
1879,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
you
are
not
being
called
upon
to
decide
whether
the
legislature
of
massachusetts
should
improve
the
lot
of
the
unmarried
by
allowing
the
untrammeled
distribution
of
contraceptives.
mr.
justice
black
speaking
for
this
court
in
the
ferguson
and
skrupa
case
said
that
courts
do
not
substitute
their
social
and
economic
beliefs
for
the
judgment
of
legislative
bodies
who
are
elected
to
pass
laws.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
particularly
where
the
commodity
has
a
certain
health,
potential
for
danger.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
i
do
not
suppose
they
are
not
supposed
to
do
that,
no
i
am
not
suggesting
--
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
well,
even
in
effect
the
due
process,
bread
seems
to
be
such
a
innocuous
thing
that
(voice
overlap).
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
it
would
with
bread
or
wheat
germ
or
something
like
that,
i
do
not
know
that
i
would
be
able
to
muster
much
of
an
argument
to
say
that
a
state
would
require
a
doctor
to
do
it.
the
issue
then
is
whether
or
not
massachusetts
may
within
the
framework
of
the
police
power,
enact
a
statute
that
i
submit
to
you
does
more
than
just
indirectly
touch
the
public
welfare,
morals,
safety,
health
of
the
community.
now,
i
think
it
is
almost
factious
to
say
that
there
is
no
connection.
a
great
deal
of
my
brother's
brief
as
given
over
to
saying
i
think
just
a
bit
of
advice
always
(inaudible)
i
suppose
to
paraphrase
your
brother's
argument,
but
i
think
the
gist
one
of
the
arguments
is,
that
the
prohibition
against
the
unmarried
having
this
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
public
morality,
nothing
at
all
to
do.
i
would
be
the
first
to
concede
the
lack
of
success
that
this
statute
has
had
with
respect
to
what
the
founders
or
the
legislature
thought
in
1879
and
the
language
that
was
used
in
the
allison
case
for
a
solid
and
moral
citizenry,
i
am
the
first
to
admit
that
it
has
certainly
not
succeeded,
but
i
do
question
whether
or
not
the
lack
of
success
of
the
statute
is
any
reason
for
declaring
it
unconstitutional.
i
think
it
is
factious
i
repeat
to
say
that
it
does
not
have
a
logical
albeit
perhaps
unsuccessful
connection
with
public
morality
not
to
mention
public
health.
i
think
to
say
that,
to
lift
the
ban
to
say
that
because
i
can
think
of
only
of
quick
parallel,
but
i
do
not
suppose
anybody
would
seriously
contend
that
because
gambling
goes
on,
illegal
gambling
goes
on
in
80%
of
the,
let
us
say
variety
stores
or
bar
rooms
in
massachusetts
that
therefore
the
gambling
statute
is
unconstitutional
because
it
is
not
working
out
for
the
anti-gambling
statute
and
i
think
the
analogy
is
not
too
far
from
here.
my
brother
has
pointed
out
many
social
evils,
all
of
which
i
think
we're
acquainted
with,
the
unwanted
child,
the
illegitimacy
rate.
now,
all
of
these
things,
as
facts
of
course
must
go
controverted.
i
am
not
suggesting
if
there
is
anything
inaccurate
in
my
brother’s
brief.
i
think
however,
where
he
fails
is,
in
asking
you
to
draw
a
nexus
between
the
failure,
for
example,
the
high
illegitimacy
rate.
now,
conspicuously
absent
from
his
brief,
is
any
study
that
would
indicate
that
in
jurisdictions
where
the
legislature
has
seen
to
relax
the
law
on
contraceptions
and
permit
a
free
distribution
of
contraceptives,
that
in
those
jurisdictions,
the
illegitimacy
rate
is
any
better
or
any
lower
and
that
is
significantly
absent
i
think
conspicuously
so
from
my
brother’s
brief.
he
is
putting
forth
these
social
evils,
all
of
which
we
--
and
i
think
would
--
but
failing
to
tie
them
in
with
the
ban
of
this
massachusetts
statute
has
on
the
free
distribution
of
contraceptives.
the
other
argument
that
i
would
and
i
think
is
important
here
is,
he
keeps
stressing
the
fact
that
nobody
pays
any
attention
to
it
anyway,
and
i
have
alluded
this
moments
ago,
but
i
would
say
that,
i
think
it
is
important
enough
to
repeat
that,
that
cannot
be
the
measure
of
whether
or
not
this
statute
is
within
the
framework
of
the
police
power,
the
massachusetts
has,
it
just
cannot
be.
now,
there
is
one
argument
that
i
would
like
to
address
with
respect
to
the
supplemental
brief,
in
appendix,
through
no
fault
of
my
brother,
i
did
not
receive
this
until
monday,
in
the
supplemental
brief
of
the
appellee,
there
was
one
argument
advanced
here
with
respect
to
an
act
of
the
congress,
a
law
that
was
passed
in
december
of
1970,
entitled
family
planning
services
and
population
research
act
of
1970.
now,
the
gist
of
the
argument
here
is
that
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
sixth
amendment,
now
will
make
the
massachusetts
law
on
this
totally
inoperative
of
something
of
an
occupation
of
the
field
argued.
now,
i
fail
to
see
and
i
repeat,
i
confess
that
i
have
not
researched
this
because
i
have
not
had
the
time,
but
in
reading
the
preamble
here
to
the
congressional
act
to
promote
public
health
and
welfare
by
expanding,
improving
in
better
coordinating
with
family
planning
service
and
population
research
activities
of
federal
government,
and
for
the
purposes,
i
feel
to
see
where
the
congress
intends
here
to
occupy
the
field
to
the
exclusion
of
a
statute
in
massachusetts
that
has
been
enacted
under
the
police
power.
i
fail
to
see
the
connection
between
the
supremacy
clause
and
the
congressional
act.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
no,
i
do
not
and
that
is
pleaded
in
my
brief
and
a
quotation
even
from
the
planned
parenthood
as
to
the
dangers,
not
only
with
respect
to
the
pill
mr.
chief
justice,
but
also
related
contraceptive
devices,
warnings,
even
on
the
can
of
emko,
there
is
a
warning
that
if
there
is
any
irritation,
see
your
doctor.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
(voice
overlap)
i
know
we
do
not
have
any
time
we
for
rebuttal,
but
i
would
like
to
make
one
point.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
brother
is
eluted
to
griswold.
i
think
if
there
is
any
case
that
way
while
factually
made
the
somewhat
close
to
death,
if
any
case
was
distinguishable
with
ease,
if
the
griswold
case
first
of
all,
griswold
dealt
in
the
main
would
use
permitted
the
doctors
of
the
directives
of
the
planned
parenthood
in
the
clinic
down
there
in
connecticut
to
use
that
but
they
where
considered
as
they
where
permitted
to
bring
the
suit
withstanding
because
theoretically,
they
might
be
aid
as
in
a
better
that
i
think
the
court
said
they
are.
what
i
am
making
is
that
in
griswold,
you
are
talking
about
use;
secondly,
you
are
talking
about
married
people
exclusively;
and
third,
you
are
talking
about
advice
given
by
qualified
physicians.
now,
on
the
entire
three
basis
here,
the
case
is
distinguishable
from
death,
because
in
death,
we
are
talking
about
the
propriety
of
a
statute,
the
bans
on
contraceptives
to
the
unmarried.
we
are
not
talking
about
use,
we
are
talking
about
giving
away
or
selling
and
third,
we
are
taking
about
people
like
that
who
are
not
qualified.
so
i
do
not
—
i
think
the
griswold
in
no
sense
aids
the
appellee
here.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
case
comes
to
this
court
on
an
appeal
from
the
first
circuit
the
court
of
appeals.
this
court
noted
probable
jurisdiction
on
march
1st,
1971.
the
case
started
factually
on
april
6th
of
1967,
when
the
appellee
mr.
baird,
addressed
group
of
people,
mostly
students
at
boston
university,
pursuant
to
an
invitation.
approximately
2,000
people
were
in
attendance.
at
that
time,
mr.
baird
used
to
give
a
demonstration
boards
in
his
lecture
on
“contraception.”
these
demonstration
boards
had
various
contraceptive
devices
and
alongside
of
the
lectern,
there
was
a
cotton
box
filled
with
various
other
contraceptive
devices.
after
the
lecture,
he
invited
the
people
to
come
to
the
lectern,
and
in
grab
bag
fashion,
take
what
they
wish
from
this
cotton.
he
then,
i
repeat
it
was
after
the
lecture,
he
then
handed
a
can
of
emko,
an
admittedly
contraceptive
device
to
a
young
lady.
now,
i
do
want
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention,
an
inaccuracy
in
the
appellant’s
brief,
in
the
reference
made
to
this
young
lady
as
being
unmarried.
the
record
does
not
indicate
nor
did
the
commonwealth
at
this
time
introduce
evidence
tending
to
show
that
she
was
unmarried.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
it
is
not
significant
however
to
the
case.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
page
four
on
the
statement
of
the
case,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
it
is
not
however,
significant
to
the
case,
but
i
do
want
to
point
out
the
inaccuracy
and
the
correction
made
by
mr.
balliro
in
his
brief,
the
original
brief,
is
well
taken.
repeatedly
doing
the
lecture,
the
appellee,
mr.
baird,
invited
the
police
to
arrest
him.
he
said,
“why
do
not
you
arrest
me
officers,
i
am
violating
your
massachusetts
law?”
finally,
when
he
handed
this
can
of
emko
to
this
particular
young
lady,
the
police
complied
with
his
wishes.
now,
the
appellee
was
charged
in
two
indictments
returned
by
the
suffolk
county
grand
jury,
for
the
violation
of
massachusetts
general
law,
chapter
272,
section
21
which
among
other
things
prohibits
the
giving
away
and
the
exhibition
of,
to
use
the
words
of
the
statute,
articles
intended
for
the
prevention
of
conception.
after
the
trial
in
suffolk
superior
court,
jury
waived
he
was
found
guilty
and
the
trial
judge
reported
the
case
to
the
supreme
judicial
court.
one
indictment
charged,
the
defendant
with
exhibiting
contraceptive
devices
in
violation
of
the
statute
and
the
other
charged
him
with
the
giving
away.
now,
there
are
other
words
in
there
which
are
not
important
to
us
such
as
selling,
lending
and
so
forth.
two
words
that
are
important,
are
exhibiting
and
giving
away.
the
supreme
judicial
court
reversed
the
conviction
of
that
under
the
indictment
charging
him
with
exhibiting
because
in
its
opinion,
it
clearly
violated
his
first
amendment
rights,
particularly
the
freedom
of
speech
right.
however,
by
divided
court,
he
had
sustained
the
conviction
under
the
indictment
charging
the
giving
away
of
the
can
of
emko.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
yes
because
i
was
going
to
call
the
court's
attention
in
a
moment
that
both
statutes
on
pages
two
and
three
should
be
read
together.
chapter
272,
section
20
which
is
the
prohibition
statute
and
chapter
272.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
yes.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
he
was
not
a
physician.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
yeah.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
if
this
girl,
and
it
would
be
at
this
point
only
that
it
would
be
significant
as
to
whether
she
was
married,
he
would
not
be
prosecuted,
certainly
if
she
were
a
married
woman.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
yes,
because
well,
many
helped
themselves.
in
this
particular
instance,
he
gave
this
girl
the
emko.
i
do
not
suppose
it
would
be
silly
of
me
to
say
that
he
was
administering
to,
in
the
way
a
doctor
would
in
handing
it
to
her.
well,
it
certainly
is
not
that.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
the
doctor-patient
relationship,
yes.
the
trial
court
then
sentenced
the
defendant
to
three
months
in
health
correction,
stayed
that
sentence
pending
appeal
to
the
supreme
judicial
court
and
a
further
stay
was
granted
while
a
petition
for
certiorari
was
addressed
to
this
court
to
the
supreme
judicial
court
and
was
denied
and
mr.
baird
then
started
serving
his
three
months
and
i
believe
he
served
34
or
35
days
of
that.
when
the
second
court
of
appeals,
and
i
am
getting
ahead
of
myself,
in
addressing
himself
to
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
to
the
district
court,
the
district
court
i
might
say
denied
the
petition
for
the
writ,
second
court
of
appeals,
for
the
first
circuit
issued
a
stay
for
a
probable
cause
and
released
the
appellee
on
bail
since
he
had
served,
i
believe
34
or
35
days
of
his
sentence.
this
case
then
is
in
the
posture
of
appeal
directly
from
that
order
of
the
first
circuit,
and
i
would
add
that
in
both
cases,
the
district
court
judge
filed
an
opinion
which
we
find
in
the
appendix,
and
of
course
the
circuit
court
filed
an
opinion.
now,
there
are
two
questions
that
i
think
are
addressed
to
this
court,
and
the
first
is,
whether
the
massachusetts
statute,
and
when
i
say
statute,
of
course
i
must
include
a
reading
together
of
the
two,
whether
or
not
the
massachusetts
statute
prohibiting
it,
the
giving
away
of
admittedly
contraceptive
substance,
whether
or
not
that
is
constitutional.
and
secondly,
whether
or
not
the
massachusetts
statute
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
william
baird,
who
was
admittedly
a
married
man
and
who
was
admittedly
also
not
a
physician
nor
a
nurse
nor
a
registered
pharmacist
or
clearly
not
a
public
health
agency.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
the
second
question
first
and
that
is,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
william
baird
has
standing
to
raise
this
question.
now,
he
is
admittedly
a
married
man.
he
is
in
effect
asking
this
court,
and
even
cursive
reading
of
the
brief
i
think
indicates
this,
he
is
asking
this
court
to
declare
unconstitutional
a
statute
as
it
applies
to
others
because
clearly
his
constitutional
rights
are
not
invaded.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
yes,
he
is.
i
do
not
believe
--
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
well,
it
is
my
understanding
that
merely
because
he
was
in
jail,
does
not
give
him
a
tailor
made
standing
as
the
way
you
(voice
overlap).
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
yes.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
i
am
suggesting
that
he
does
not
have
standing
as
we
know
standing
simply
because
he
was
convicted
of
the
statute.
now,
perhaps,
mr.
justice
brennan,
you
are
saying
to
me
well,
anytime
there
is
a
first
amendment
problem
here,
he
does
not
have
to
have
the
kind
of
standing,
but
i
am
a
little
ahead
of
myself,
but
i
do
not
believe
that
he
has
first
amendments
--
first
amendment
rights
here.
i
do
not
see
where
his
rights
have
been
invaded.
i
do
not
see
where
his
wife's
rights
have
been
invaded.
both
of
them
can
seek
and
receive
contraceptive
devices
within
the
framework
of
massachusetts
law.
i
think
the
language
in
the
raines
case
is
clearly
opposite
here,
where
this
court
said
that
the
rule
that
one
to
whom
application
of
a
statute
is
constitutional,
will
not
be
had
to
attack
it
because
it
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
somebody
else.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
well,
i
would
--
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
i
would
say
he
has
standing
there,
if
as
a
basis
for
saying
that,
the
right
to
be
a
physician
or
the
right,
the
accompanying
right
is
the
first
amendment
right.
but,
i
do
not
see
that
--
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
in
answer
to
you
well
mr.
justice,
what
i
would
say
that
he
would
have
no
more
standing,
he
has
no
more
standing
here
than
if
he
went
to
practice
medicine,
was
arrested
for
the
illegal
practice
of
medicine
and
then
say
well,
that
statute
is
unconstitutional,
i
do
not
think
that
this
court
would
say
that
he
had
standing
because
the
practice
of
medicine
is
not
a
first
amendment
right
as
such
for
a
man
who
is
obviously
not
(voice
overlap)
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
well,
the
other
grounds
that
he
is
talking
about,
mainly
due
process,
i
will
take
in
a
moment,
but
the
due
process
that
he
is
talking
about
is
some
right
of
privacy.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
there
is
no
problem
with
that
at
all.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
well,
i
would
say
i
think
it
is
trenchantly
different,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it
is
trenchantly
different
because
from
--
and
i
hope
that
the
court
will
see
from
our
brief
that
there
are
some
very
dangerous
sidelights
and
side
effects
to
the
use
of
many
contraceptives
and
i
think
an
examination,
i
am
ahead
of
myself,
but
i
think
an
examination
of
the
senate
committee
on
monopoly
when
the
pill
was
being
examined.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
well,
i
must
need
to
go
the
merits.
i
think
to
answer
your
wheat
germ
example,
that
is
all.
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
a
good
analogy.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
well,
i
think
he
may
think
so,
but
i
do
not
believe
that
he
is
thinking
this.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
no,
i
do
not
believe
you
do.
no,
i
believe
that,
that
has
to
be
taken
with
respect
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
itself.
but
i
do
believe
that
there
is
a
serious
problem
here
in
standing
because
he
himself
and
his
wife
are
not
prevented
from
the
benefits
of
the
massachusetts
statute
in
receiving
contraceptives
or
being
prescribed
contraceptives.
there
is
no
right
of
privacy
involved
here
with
him.
this
is
not
a
griswold
situation
who
he
keeps
speaking
about
a
right
of
privacy
for
example,
but
it
is
not
his
right
of
privacy.
i
think
the
district
court
judge
said
that
more
eloquently
than
i
did
in
his
opinion.
he
said
in
effect
and
i
am
just
paraphrasing,
it
is
in
the
record
and
he
said
that
we
would
hear
mr.
baird
if
his
right
of
privacy,
but
he
is
asking,
you
to
hear
him
with
respect
to
the
right
of
privacy
of
the
unmarried
for
example,
and
i
do
not
believe
that
he
has
standing
to
do
that.
it
is
interesting
to
take
his
brief
and
just
some
of
the
head
notes
i
think
are
interesting
on
page
five.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
no
reasonable
relation
to
the
excise
of
his
power.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
i
raised
the
first
amendment
mr.
justice
brennan,
only
in
response
to
the
question
of
standing.
this
court
has
said
that
a
person
would
have
standing
which
he
otherwise
does
not
have.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
well,
of
course
the
first
circuit
found
that
he
did
have
standing.
this
is
i
suppose
--
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
yes.
that
is
right.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
that
is
right.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
yes,
i
am
stoutly
contenting
that
he
does
not
have
standing
for
the
very
reason
that
he
does
not
have
a
first
amendment
freedom
or
right
involved
here.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
well,
on
page
eight.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
he
was
first
abstinence
for
example
on
page
eight,
it
says
it
is
an
abstinence
somatic
answer.
he
refers
to
maternal
mortality
on
page
nine,
or
infant
mortality,
but
it
is
not,
i
repeat
open
to
him.
again,
he
purports
to
be
the
voice
of
somebody
else
in
this
particular
question.
he
is
asking
you
to
overrule
or
to
strike
the
statute
because
the
statute
effects
other
people
not
him.
health
characteristics
on
page
10,
the
unwanted
child
and
so
forth.
i
repeat,
i
think
that
he
does
not
have
in
the
stricter
sense
the
standing
that
he
should
have
here
to
raise
these
other
related
questions
whatever,
i
am
not
questioning
the
various
findings
and
the
statistics
that
he
has
in
the
brief,
that
is
not
my
point.
now,
to
come
to
the
first
question
which
is
raised,
and
namely
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
itself,
it
prohibits
among
other
things,
a
person
who
is
not
a
doctor
reading
the
statutes
together
from
giving
away
and
it
prohibits
a
person
who
is
not
a
nurse
or
a
registered
pharmacist
giving
any
advice
or
information.
i
think
it
is
critically
important
at
this
juncture
to
examine
what
the
issue
is
not.
you
are
not
being
called
upon
in
this
case
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
statute
making
it
crime
to
use
a
contraceptive
would
be
unconstitutional
because
use
is
certainly
not
prohibited.
you
are
not
being
asked
to
rule
on
the
wisdom
of
the
legislature
in
prohibiting
because
i
suggest
respectfully
that
is
beyond
the
power
of
this
court
is
to
whether
or
not
it
is
wise
for
the
massachusetts
legislature
to
have
it.
you
will
certainly
not
sit
as
a
super
legislature
to
determine
whether
it
is
wise
to
do
it.
you
are
not
being
asked
to
determine
whether
or
not
contraception
is
per
se
evil
or
in
violation
of
the
natural
law.
though,
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
certainly
the
statute
was
enacted
in
1879,
clearly
a
public
morality
statute
and
while
for
the
last
few
years,
there
has
been
a
solid
attack
on
the
question
of
the
natural
law
or
whether
or
not
it
is
violative,
still
some
--
few
of
us
who
believe
it
is
also
against
the
natural
law,
but
that
is
not
the
issue.
you
are
not
being
called
upon
to
determine
the
intrinsic
evil
of
contraception.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
1879,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
you
are
not
being
called
upon
to
decide
whether
the
legislature
of
massachusetts
should
improve
the
lot
of
the
unmarried
by
allowing
the
untrammeled
distribution
of
contraceptives.
mr.
justice
black
speaking
for
this
court
in
the
ferguson
and
skrupa
case
said
that
courts
do
not
substitute
their
social
and
economic
beliefs
for
the
judgment
of
legislative
bodies
who
are
elected
to
pass
laws.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
particularly
where
the
commodity
has
a
certain
health,
potential
for
danger.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
i
do
not
suppose
they
are
not
supposed
to
do
that,
no
i
am
not
suggesting
--
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
well,
even
in
effect
the
due
process,
bread
seems
to
be
such
a
innocuous
thing
that
(voice
overlap).
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
it
would
with
bread
or
wheat
germ
or
something
like
that,
i
do
not
know
that
i
would
be
able
to
muster
much
of
an
argument
to
say
that
a
state
would
require
a
doctor
to
do
it.
the
issue
then
is
whether
or
not
massachusetts
may
within
the
framework
of
the
police
power,
enact
a
statute
that
i
submit
to
you
does
more
than
just
indirectly
touch
the
public
welfare,
morals,
safety,
health
of
the
community.
now,
i
think
it
is
almost
factious
to
say
that
there
is
no
connection.
a
great
deal
of
my
brother's
brief
as
given
over
to
saying
i
think
just
a
bit
of
advice
always
(inaudible)
i
suppose
to
paraphrase
your
brother's
argument,
but
i
think
the
gist
one
of
the
arguments
is,
that
the
prohibition
against
the
unmarried
having
this
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
public
morality,
nothing
at
all
to
do.
i
would
be
the
first
to
concede
the
lack
of
success
that
this
statute
has
had
with
respect
to
what
the
founders
or
the
legislature
thought
in
1879
and
the
language
that
was
used
in
the
allison
case
for
a
solid
and
moral
citizenry,
i
am
the
first
to
admit
that
it
has
certainly
not
succeeded,
but
i
do
question
whether
or
not
the
lack
of
success
of
the
statute
is
any
reason
for
declaring
it
unconstitutional.
i
think
it
is
factious
i
repeat
to
say
that
it
does
not
have
a
logical
albeit
perhaps
unsuccessful
connection
with
public
morality
not
to
mention
public
health.
i
think
to
say
that,
to
lift
the
ban
to
say
that
because
i
can
think
of
only
of
quick
parallel,
but
i
do
not
suppose
anybody
would
seriously
contend
that
because
gambling
goes
on,
illegal
gambling
goes
on
in
80%
of
the,
let
us
say
variety
stores
or
bar
rooms
in
massachusetts
that
therefore
the
gambling
statute
is
unconstitutional
because
it
is
not
working
out
for
the
anti-gambling
statute
and
i
think
the
analogy
is
not
too
far
from
here.
my
brother
has
pointed
out
many
social
evils,
all
of
which
i
think
we're
acquainted
with,
the
unwanted
child,
the
illegitimacy
rate.
now,
all
of
these
things,
as
facts
of
course
must
go
controverted.
i
am
not
suggesting
if
there
is
anything
inaccurate
in
my
brother’s
brief.
i
think
however,
where
he
fails
is,
in
asking
you
to
draw
a
nexus
between
the
failure,
for
example,
the
high
illegitimacy
rate.
now,
conspicuously
absent
from
his
brief,
is
any
study
that
would
indicate
that
in
jurisdictions
where
the
legislature
has
seen
to
relax
the
law
on
contraceptions
and
permit
a
free
distribution
of
contraceptives,
that
in
those
jurisdictions,
the
illegitimacy
rate
is
any
better
or
any
lower
and
that
is
significantly
absent
i
think
conspicuously
so
from
my
brother’s
brief.
he
is
putting
forth
these
social
evils,
all
of
which
we
--
and
i
think
would
--
but
failing
to
tie
them
in
with
the
ban
of
this
massachusetts
statute
has
on
the
free
distribution
of
contraceptives.
the
other
argument
that
i
would
and
i
think
is
important
here
is,
he
keeps
stressing
the
fact
that
nobody
pays
any
attention
to
it
anyway,
and
i
have
alluded
this
moments
ago,
but
i
would
say
that,
i
think
it
is
important
enough
to
repeat
that,
that
cannot
be
the
measure
of
whether
or
not
this
statute
is
within
the
framework
of
the
police
power,
the
massachusetts
has,
it
just
cannot
be.
now,
there
is
one
argument
that
i
would
like
to
address
with
respect
to
the
supplemental
brief,
in
appendix,
through
no
fault
of
my
brother,
i
did
not
receive
this
until
monday,
in
the
supplemental
brief
of
the
appellee,
there
was
one
argument
advanced
here
with
respect
to
an
act
of
the
congress,
a
law
that
was
passed
in
december
of
1970,
entitled
family
planning
services
and
population
research
act
of
1970.
now,
the
gist
of
the
argument
here
is
that
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
sixth
amendment,
now
will
make
the
massachusetts
law
on
this
totally
inoperative
of
something
of
an
occupation
of
the
field
argued.
now,
i
fail
to
see
and
i
repeat,
i
confess
that
i
have
not
researched
this
because
i
have
not
had
the
time,
but
in
reading
the
preamble
here
to
the
congressional
act
to
promote
public
health
and
welfare
by
expanding,
improving
in
better
coordinating
with
family
planning
service
and
population
research
activities
of
federal
government,
and
for
the
purposes,
i
feel
to
see
where
the
congress
intends
here
to
occupy
the
field
to
the
exclusion
of
a
statute
in
massachusetts
that
has
been
enacted
under
the
police
power.
i
fail
to
see
the
connection
between
the
supremacy
clause
and
the
congressional
act.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
no,
i
do
not
and
that
is
pleaded
in
my
brief
and
a
quotation
even
from
the
planned
parenthood
as
to
the
dangers,
not
only
with
respect
to
the
pill
mr.
chief
justice,
but
also
related
contraceptive
devices,
warnings,
even
on
the
can
of
emko,
there
is
a
warning
that
if
there
is
any
irritation,
see
your
doctor.
mr.
joseph
r.
nolan
(voice
overlap)
i
know
we
do
not
have
any
time
we
for
rebuttal,
but
i
would
like
to
make
one
point.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
brother
is
eluted
to
griswold.
i
think
if
there
is
any
case
that
way
while
factually
made
the
somewhat
close
to
death,
if
any
case
was
distinguishable
with
ease,
if
the
griswold
case
first
of
all,
griswold
dealt
in
the
main
would
use
permitted
the
doctors
of
the
directives
of
the
planned
parenthood
in
the
clinic
down
there
in
connecticut
to
use
that
but
they
where
considered
as
they
where
permitted
to
bring
the
suit
withstanding
because
theoretically,
they
might
be
aid
as
in
a
better
that
i
think
the
court
said
they
are.
what
i
am
making
is
that
in
griswold,
you
are
talking
about
use;
secondly,
you
are
talking
about
married
people
exclusively;
and
third,
you
are
talking
about
advice
given
by
qualified
physicians.
now,
on
the
entire
three
basis
here,
the
case
is
distinguishable
from
death,
because
in
death,
we
are
talking
about
the
propriety
of
a
statute,
the
bans
on
contraceptives
to
the
unmarried.
we
are
not
talking
about
use,
we
are
talking
about
giving
away
or
selling
and
third,
we
are
taking
about
people
like
that
who
are
not
qualified.
so
i
do
not
—
i
think
the
griswold
in
no
sense
aids
the
appellee
here.
