mr.
joseph
d.
tydings
i
think,
i
would
prefer
to,
may
it
please
the
court
to
begin
now,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
joseph
d.
tydings
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
dissenting
opinion
in
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court.
that
decision
was
four
to
three,
found
on
the
page
26
of
the
opinion.
i
think,
it
is
a
very
fine
dissent.
mr.
joseph
d.
tydings
that
is
on
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts.
mr.
joseph
d.
tydings
now,
this
is
the
first
when
the
case
originally
went
up
and
it
was
held
four
to
three
that
the
--
mr.
joseph
d.
tydings
well,
i
was
referring
the
one
by
judges
whittemore
and
cutter
found
on
page
26,
and
i
also
in
regard
to
standing,
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
implicitly
recognized
the
standing
of
the
appellee
and
it
is
stated
on
page
26
there.
the
issue
was
never
raised
until
oral
argument
before
the
first
circuit.
when
a
man
is
in
jail,
convicted,
serving
time
because
of
an
unconstitutional
statute,
i
fail
to
see
how
he
could
better
have
a
standing
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
it.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
brief
which
i
filed
and
which
my
brother
just
referred
to,
describes
with
some
particularity
the
legislative
history
in
the
background
of
the
family
planning
acts
before
the
congress
of
the
united
states.
he
failed
to
mention,
and
we
are
talking
about
the
supremacy
clause
here
with
respect
to
three
separate
statutes.
the
first
one
was
the
oeo
statute
in
1964,
which
authorized
family
planning
clinics
to
be
operated
throughout
this
country,
the
contraceptives
to
be
distributed
to
married
and
unmarried,
rich
and
poor
without
discrimination
to
protect
against
the
unwanted
pregnancy.
in
1967,
that
act
was
amended
to
specifically
make
it
a
program
of
emphasis
and
earmark
funds
in
oeo
that
it
had
to
be
used
for
that
purpose.
in
1967,
we
amended
title
iv
and
title
v
of
the
social
securities
act
to
provide
that
6%
of
all
funds
appropriated
for
maternal
and
child
care,
had
to
be
expended
in
state
family
planning
clinics,
for
the
distribution
of
information
and
contraceptives
to
married
and
unmarried
and
the
like
and
the
regulation
specifically
said
that
a
state
could
not
discriminate
between
married
and
unmarried.
in
title
iv,
we
specified
that
every
woman
receiving
public
assistance,
certainly
on
welfare,
have
to
have
the
opportunity,
married
or
unmarried,
rich
or
poor,
to
have
family
planing
(voice
overlap).
mr.
joseph
d.
tydings
yes.
mr.
joseph
d.
tydings
yes.
this
is
the
whole
substance
of
my
brief.
the
one
joseph
d.
tydings,
david
rapstien,
number
70-17.
mr.
joseph
d.
tydings
supplemental
briefs
in
attendance?
mr.
joseph
d.
tydings
i
am
sorry,
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
wish
you
did.[laughter]
mr.
joseph
d.
tydings
the
fourth
statute
was
the
family
planning
and
services
act
of
1970
which
my
brother
referred
to,
which
specifically
i
might
say
in
a
very
first
clause
of
the
act,
section
2,
it
is
a
purpose
of
this
act,
to
assist
in
making
comprehensive
voluntary
family
planning
services
readily
available
to
all
persons
desiring
such
services.
the
president,
when
he
signed
that
act,
and
two
parts
of
his
massage,
referred
to
adequate
family
planning
services
within
next
five
years
to
all
those
who
want
them.
this
act
merely
significantly
increased
the
amount
of
funds
available.
but
clearly,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
massachusetts
statute
stands
and
the
wisconsin
statute
stands,
they
block
the
carrying
out
of
this
statute
and
of
the
1964
act
and
the
1967
amendments
of
the
social
securities
act
in
massachusetts
and
the
state
of
wisconsin.
mr.
joseph
d.
tydings
i
am
afraid
that
it
would
break
down
the
whole
trust
of
the
operation
of
the
program
for
the
reason
that
first
of
all,
you
are
talking
about
non-prescriptive
and
prescriptive
(voice
overlap)
mr.
joseph
d.
tydings
well,
it
would
be,
certainly
it
would
break
down
the
whole
trust
of
the
act.
i
would
say,
if
i
were
the
administrator,
i
would
let
them
have
the
money.
mr.
joseph
d.
tydings
it
does
not
say
that
anywhere.
but
the
trust
of
the
act,
mr.
justice
white,
the
trust
of
the
act
is
to
provide
these
family
planning
services
and
contraceptives
to
the
poor,
to
the
unmarried
mothers
who
need
them,
to
provide
them
in
clinics,
and
you
just
cannot
possibly
afford
to
have
a
doctor
in
every
clinic.
and
then,
when
you
tie
on
top
of
that,
you
make
no
distinction
between
prescriptive
and
non-prescriptive
drugs,
dangerous
and
non-dangerous
drugs.
in
massachusetts,
it
is
perfectly
alright,
to
sell
a
condom
to
a
man
if
he
says
“i
am
unmarried
man”
if
he
is
going
to
use
it
for
purposes
of
venereal
disease
protection,
but
if
he
is
going
to
use
it
for
family
planning
protection
then,
it
is
a
felony.
mr.
joseph
d.
tydings
no,
it
has
not.
mr.
joseph
d.
tydings
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
brennan.
the
right
to
make
a
decision
to
protect
one’s
life
or
to
protect
one’s
health,
is
a
fundamental
personal
constitutional
right
within
the
number
and
certainly
of
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendments
and
the
ninth
amendments
as
described
in
judge
goldberg’s
decision
in
the
griswold
case.
i
think
the
right
not
to
expose
one’s
life,
risk
one’s
life
to
death
or
to
risk
one’s
health
by
being
forced
to
have
an
unwanted
child,
is
a
constitutionally
protected
right.
now,
the
massachusetts
statute
is
arbitrary,
capricious
and
has
no
reasonable
relation
to
a
proper
legislative
purpose
because
it
violates
a
fundamental
personal
right
with
no
compelling
state
reason
and
would
not
a
narrowly
defined
statute.
and
then,
we
go
one
step
further
if
i
might.
there
are
two
possible
reasons
for
the
massachusetts
statute.
the
first
would
be
health
and
yet
how
can
you
argue
this
is
a
health
statute,
if
you
permit
a
married
woman
to
receive
advice
and
prescriptions
from
a
gynecologist
and
you
do
not
permit
an
unmarried
woman.
mr.
joseph
d.
tydings
well,
it
is
still
an
issue
on
the
massachusetts
statute?
mr.
joseph
d.
tydings
no.
there
is
no
evidence,
but
there
was
before
college
audience
--
may
it
please,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
joseph
d.
tydings
well,
it
is.
the
offense
was
there,
but
the
question
of
whether
or
not
he
was
married
or
unmarried
relates
to
the
validity
of
the
statute.
this
statute,
is
inherently
unconstitutional
because
there
is
no
compelling
state
reason
for
it,
and
if
i
may
continue,
i
will
show
some
of
the
absurdities
and
the
contradictions,
which
put
it
clearly
behind
any
justification
either
as
a
health
statute
or
a
moral
statute.
for
instance,
this
statute
--
mr.
joseph
d.
tydings
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
joseph
d.
tydings
exactly.
let
me
take
it
a
step
further
mr.
chief
justice.
this
statute
says,
that
you
cannot
get
a
prescription
for
a
non-prescriptive,
non-dangerous
contraceptive
like
emko
foam
or
a
condom
unless
you
go
to
a
doctor,
unless
the
sole
purpose
is
for
venereal
disease.
so
the
poor
mother,
let
us
say,
the
poor
married
mother
for
the
time
being,
without
regard
to
the
unmarried
woman,
she
is
not
going
to
have
$5
or
$10
to
go
down
to
a
doctor
and
get
a
prescription,
and
go
down
and
get
a
can
of
foam.
i
mean,
that
cuts
off
any
opportunity
for
her
to
protect
her
own
health.
she
might
have
had
four
or
five
children,
it
might
be
very
risky
for
her
to
have
another
one,
and
yet
this
statute,
it
just
arbitrarily
discriminates
against
her.
you
have
got
the
situation
where
until
1966,
mr.
chief
justice,
this
statute
did
not
even
hold
out
any
relationship
to
health
whatsoever.
it
said
that
no
woman,
married
or
unmarried
could
receive
a
contraceptive
from
anyone.
now,
they
put
in
that
second
statutory
clause
about
a
married
woman
and
a
doctor’s
prescription
and
so
forth,
after
the
griswold
decision,
but
they
try
to
tailor
it
absolutely
as
closely
as
they
could
without
any
relationship
to
a
health
measure.
mr.
joseph
d.
tydings
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday
afternoon,
when
the
court
recessed,
we
were
discussing
the
only
possible
interest
of
possible
reasons
for
the
massachusetts
statute
and
the
first,
would
be
the
health
reason
and
i
was
pointing
out
the
absurd
of
these
of
the
statute
and
why
it
was
not
a
health
statute.
and
you
recall,
i
pointed
out
that
it
permitted
a
married
woman
to
be
examined
by
a
doctor,
a
gynecologist,
but
not
an
unmarried
woman.
it
permitted
the—
really
a
rich
married
woman
with
easy
access
to
a
physician
to
get
all
the
prescriptions
she
needed,
but
it
discriminated
against
the
poor
married
woman,
because
it
required
her
to
get
a
prescription
for
a
non
prescriptive
or
a
non
dangerous
drug
or
contraceptive.
i
might
at
this
time,
point
out
to
the
court,
that
the
massachusetts
general
law
at
chapter
270
section
3
at
page
95
prohibits
the
giving
away
of
medicines
or
drugs
injurious
to
the
user,
and
it
incorporates
the
regulations
promulgated
by
the
food
and
drug
administration
of
the
united
states,
and
under
those
regulations,
members
of
the
court,
there
are
certain
contraceptives
which
must
in
massachusetts
and
every
other
state,
be
prescribed
by
a
physician,
for
instance
the
pill,
the
iud
or
the
diaphragm.
but
the
non
dangerous,
the
non
prescriptive
drugs
are
like
the
condom,
like
the
foam,
like
the
vagina
jellies,
they
should
be
issued
in
massachusetts
like
any
other
state.
if
the
massachusetts
legislature
had
an
interest
in
the
health,
they
would
have
put
it
in
here,
but
they
protected
against
the
health.
this
statute
is
purely
and
simply
anti-contraceptive.
let
me
give
you
some
of
the
patent
absurdities.
a
married
woman,
who
has
been
separated
from
her
husband
for
three
or
four
years,
she
can
go,
they
prescribe
and
get
a
contraceptive
for
family
planning
purposes,
despite
the
fact,
she
had
not
seen
her
husband
for
years,
obviously
for
illicit
purposes.
but
the
poor
married
woman
does
not
have
enough
money
to
go
to
the
doctor,
she
can
not.
a
bride,
a
girl
about
to
be
married,
she
can
not
go
to
a
gynaecologist
and
be
prescribed
a
contraceptive,
non
prescriptive
or
any
other
type,
until
after
the
wedding
ceremony
and
she
dashes
from
the
church
to
the
gynaecologist,
to
the
drug
store
and
back
to
the
wedding
reception.
it
is
patently
absurd.
now,
let
us
move
on
to
the
so
called
moral
aspect
of
the
statute.
and
if
you
were
to
assume
there
was
a
moral
reason,
it
would
be
i
assume
to
restrain
or
deter
fornication.
but
how
could
they
permit,
if
that
was
the
desire,
how
can
they
draw
a
statute
which
would
permit
a
married
woman
who
had
been
either
separated
from
the
husband
or
wife
had
been
away
for
two
or
three
years,
in
the
process
of
a
divorce,
a
divorce
decree
not
final,
how
could
she
go
down
and
get
a
contraceptive
for
family
planning
purposes?
and
a
young
married
woman
could
not.
if
there
was
really
a
deterring
effect,
why
would
not
you
increase
the
statute
from
a
misdemeanor?
fornication
in
massachusetts
is
a
misdemeanor,
90
days.
whereas
the
selling
of
a
non
prescriptive,
non
dangerous
contraceptive
for
family
planning
purposes
to
an
unmarried
person,
that
is
five
years.
it
is
a
felony.
that
they
were
really
concerned
with
deterring
the
illicit
or
pre-marital
intercourse,
and
they
would
increase
the
fornication
statute
from
a
misdemeanor
90
days,
and
they
would
enforce
the
law
as
it
exists.
mr.
joseph
d.
tydings
in
my
understanding
it
is.
mr.
joseph
d.
tydings
and
yet
this
—
mr.
joseph
d.
tydings
i
do
not
know.
mr.
joseph
d.
tydings
i
can
not
answer
that
(voice
overlap).
mr.
joseph
d.
tydings
that
is
right.
so,
if
adultery
or
the
restrain
of
adultery
is
a
purpose,
it
is
completely
vitiated
by
the
language
of
the
statute.
the
real
trust
to
the
statute
—
may
it
please
the
court
is
it
is
—
it
is
a
hold
over
from
the
constakien(ph)
days.
it
was
originally
and
until
1966,
it
was
designed
to
prevent
any
person,
married
or
unmarried
from
using
a
contraceptive
in
the
state
of
massachusetts.
after
the
griswold
case,
they
amended
it
as
narrowly
as
possible
to
try
and
come
within
the
contlines
of
the
griswold
case.
but,
it
is
not
a
health
statute
and
it
is
really
not
a
justifiable
moral
statute.
may
it
please
the
court,
i
think
the
cases
uniformly
hold
when
you
are
dealing
with
a
fundamental
personal
right,
and
i
think
there
is
a
fundamental
personal
right
here,
namely,
the
right
of
an
individual
or
woman
not
to
have
an
unwanted
pregnancy
which
maybe
dangerous
to
her
health
or
life,
then
you
have
got
to
show
a
compelling
interest,
and
it
has
got
to
be
narrowly
defined
in
the
state
of
massachusetts,
meets
neither
of
these.
but
even
more,
the
massachusetts
statute
violates
the
strong
interest
of
society
and
the
people
of
massachusetts
and
that
interest
is
to
protect
the
health
and
safety
of
a
mother
and
a
child,
be
that
mother
married
or
unmarried,
there
is
a
strong
interest
to
protect
the
health
and
safety
of
the
child.
there
is
a
strong
interest
to
society
in
massachusetts
to
prevent
unwanted
pregnancies
and
there
is
a
strong
interest
in
the
state
of
massachusetts
to
prevent
unwanted
and
illegitimate
children
being
brought
in
the
world.
and
look
what
the
statute
does?
i
mean,
look
at
the
damage
caused
by
unwanted
pregnancies.
take
the
mother
to
begin
with,
the
mother
and
i
might
say
that
in
the
state
or
massachusetts
from
the
period
of
1964,
i
think
1966-1968,
31%
of
the
white
children
conceived
in
the
state
of
massachusetts
where
conceived
out
of
wedlock,
and
64%
of
the
non
white
children
where
conceived
out
of
wedlock.
now
let
us
not
say
they
were
illegitimate,
because
the
illegitimacy
rate
was
i
think
6%
in
massachusetts.
but
they
were
conceived
out
of
wedlock.
so
as
far
as
any
deterrent
effect,
it
does
not
have
any.
but
look
at
the
consequences
to
the
unmarried
mother.
first
of
all,
she
is
likely
—
if
she
has
—
if
she
is
so
desperate
that
she
does
not
—
she
can
not
have
a
child,
she
will
go
to
some
black
abortionist,
particularly
if
she
is
poor,
perhaps,
inflict
on
herself
some
grave
and
serious
physical
injury,
she
is
likely
to
die.
if
she
does
have
a
child
then
she
is
illegitimate.
it
puts
her
in
a
cycle
from
which
she
may
never
recover.
you
know,
i
think
as
well
as
i,
the
whole
social
problems
of
our
nation
with
respect
to
the
poor,
unwanted
child
in
a
welfare
mother.
but
once
she
gets
in
that
cycle,
it
is
almost
impossible
to
get
out.
her
whole
life
is
committed
from
that
point
on.
the
health
consequences
to
the
—
particularly
the
poor
unmarried
mother
are
great.
you
have
a
far
higher,
maternal
death
rate
from
the
unmarried
mother
than
you
do
from
the
married
mother.
and,
let
us
look
at
the
child.
the
child
born
out
of
wedlock,
and
the
brief,
may
it
please
the
court
by
mrs.
harriet
pilpel
for
the
planned
parenthood
on
from
pages
20-26,
very
exquisite
insights,
all
of
the
studies,
hew
now
for
which
backup
the
back
to,
i
am
going
to
just
comment
on
you,
i
am
sure
that
you
know
them
anyway,
but
it
is
very
excellent
presentation
in
this
brief.
but
take
the
child,
you
got
the
higher
death
rate
of
children
born
out
of
wedlock,
higher
premature
births,
a
higher
infant
mortality
in
the
first
year.
the
greater
likelihood
of
disease
and
mental
retardation,
and
of
course
the
most
—
the
saddest
and
really
the
most
tragic
thing
of
all,
the
greater
likelihood
of
child
abuse,
child
beating
and
all
the
type
of
anti-social
activities
which
contribute
to
making
that
child
a
ward
of
society
from
then
on.
now
finally,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
it
is
the
strong
interest
in
society
in
the
state
of
massachusetts,
to
prevent
unwanted,
illegitimate
children
from
being
born,
because
these
poor
children,
with
many
instances
no
father,
many
instances
the
mother
maybe
three
or
four
illegitimate
children
already.
what
chance
do
they
have
to
make
it
in
our
life?
they
just
do
not
have
a
chance?
and
if
you
look
at
the
statistics
in
your
institutions
whether
they
are
mental
institutions,
whether
they
are
penal
institutions,
you
will
find
that
the
prevalence
of
the
unwanted
child
without
the
father
is
right
up
at
the
top.
and
that
was
a
whole
trust
and
reasoning
for
the
entire
legislative
program.
if
the
congress
is
passed
during
the
past
six
or
seven
years,
beginning
with
the
lel
act
in
64,
the
67th
amendment,
the
social
security
act,
and
finally,
the
family
planning
act
of
1970.
in
may
of
this
year,
hew
announced
in
the
state
of
massachusetts,
that
they
are
going
to
fund
four
major
projects
for
low
income
families
and
low
boston,
springfield
and
one
other
area
in
the
state
of
massachusetts
under
the
1970
act,
and
the
course
the
regulation
say
that
if
you
cannot
discriminate
between
married
and
unmarried.
now,
what
happens
if
this
statute
is
held
constitutional?
you
are
going
to
mean
that
in
the
state
of
massachusetts
and
all
the
nine
hospitals
involved
for
low
income
mothers.
you
are
going
to
say
sorry
to
the
unmarried
mother
who
might
to
have
four
or
five
illegitimate
children
already.
the
next
birth
may
send
her
to
cause
grave
physical
injury,
even
death
you
can
say,
i
am
sorry,
but
we
can
not
prescribe
you
because
you
are
unmarried?
i
mean,
that
is
patently
against
the
best
interest
of
the
state
of
massachusetts,
it
is
against
the
whole
trust
of
federal
legislation.
it
is
an
outdated
anachronism
from
a
statute
back
in
1870's
which
has
no
business
being
on
the
statute
books
today.
mr.
joseph
d.
tydings
i
think,
i
would
prefer
to,
may
it
please
the
court
to
begin
now,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
joseph
d.
tydings
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
dissenting
opinion
in
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court.
that
decision
was
four
to
three,
found
on
the
page
26
of
the
opinion.
i
think,
it
is
a
very
fine
dissent.
mr.
joseph
d.
tydings
that
is
on
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts.
mr.
joseph
d.
tydings
now,
this
is
the
first
when
the
case
originally
went
up
and
it
was
held
four
to
three
that
the
--
mr.
joseph
d.
tydings
well,
i
was
referring
the
one
by
judges
whittemore
and
cutter
found
on
page
26,
and
i
also
in
regard
to
standing,
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
implicitly
recognized
the
standing
of
the
appellee
and
it
is
stated
on
page
26
there.
the
issue
was
never
raised
until
oral
argument
before
the
first
circuit.
when
a
man
is
in
jail,
convicted,
serving
time
because
of
an
unconstitutional
statute,
i
fail
to
see
how
he
could
better
have
a
standing
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
it.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
brief
which
i
filed
and
which
my
brother
just
referred
to,
describes
with
some
particularity
the
legislative
history
in
the
background
of
the
family
planning
acts
before
the
congress
of
the
united
states.
he
failed
to
mention,
and
we
are
talking
about
the
supremacy
clause
here
with
respect
to
three
separate
statutes.
the
first
one
was
the
oeo
statute
in
1964,
which
authorized
family
planning
clinics
to
be
operated
throughout
this
country,
the
contraceptives
to
be
distributed
to
married
and
unmarried,
rich
and
poor
without
discrimination
to
protect
against
the
unwanted
pregnancy.
in
1967,
that
act
was
amended
to
specifically
make
it
a
program
of
emphasis
and
earmark
funds
in
oeo
that
it
had
to
be
used
for
that
purpose.
in
1967,
we
amended
title
iv
and
title
v
of
the
social
securities
act
to
provide
that
6%
of
all
funds
appropriated
for
maternal
and
child
care,
had
to
be
expended
in
state
family
planning
clinics,
for
the
distribution
of
information
and
contraceptives
to
married
and
unmarried
and
the
like
and
the
regulation
specifically
said
that
a
state
could
not
discriminate
between
married
and
unmarried.
in
title
iv,
we
specified
that
every
woman
receiving
public
assistance,
certainly
on
welfare,
have
to
have
the
opportunity,
married
or
unmarried,
rich
or
poor,
to
have
family
planing
(voice
overlap).
mr.
joseph
d.
tydings
yes.
mr.
joseph
d.
tydings
yes.
this
is
the
whole
substance
of
my
brief.
the
one
joseph
d.
tydings,
david
rapstien,
number
70-17.
mr.
joseph
d.
tydings
supplemental
briefs
in
attendance?
mr.
joseph
d.
tydings
i
am
sorry,
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
wish
you
did.[laughter]
mr.
joseph
d.
tydings
the
fourth
statute
was
the
family
planning
and
services
act
of
1970
which
my
brother
referred
to,
which
specifically
i
might
say
in
a
very
first
clause
of
the
act,
section
2,
it
is
a
purpose
of
this
act,
to
assist
in
making
comprehensive
voluntary
family
planning
services
readily
available
to
all
persons
desiring
such
services.
the
president,
when
he
signed
that
act,
and
two
parts
of
his
massage,
referred
to
adequate
family
planning
services
within
next
five
years
to
all
those
who
want
them.
this
act
merely
significantly
increased
the
amount
of
funds
available.
but
clearly,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
massachusetts
statute
stands
and
the
wisconsin
statute
stands,
they
block
the
carrying
out
of
this
statute
and
of
the
1964
act
and
the
1967
amendments
of
the
social
securities
act
in
massachusetts
and
the
state
of
wisconsin.
mr.
joseph
d.
tydings
i
am
afraid
that
it
would
break
down
the
whole
trust
of
the
operation
of
the
program
for
the
reason
that
first
of
all,
you
are
talking
about
non-prescriptive
and
prescriptive
(voice
overlap)
mr.
joseph
d.
tydings
well,
it
would
be,
certainly
it
would
break
down
the
whole
trust
of
the
act.
i
would
say,
if
i
were
the
administrator,
i
would
let
them
have
the
money.
mr.
joseph
d.
tydings
it
does
not
say
that
anywhere.
but
the
trust
of
the
act,
mr.
justice
white,
the
trust
of
the
act
is
to
provide
these
family
planning
services
and
contraceptives
to
the
poor,
to
the
unmarried
mothers
who
need
them,
to
provide
them
in
clinics,
and
you
just
cannot
possibly
afford
to
have
a
doctor
in
every
clinic.
and
then,
when
you
tie
on
top
of
that,
you
make
no
distinction
between
prescriptive
and
non-prescriptive
drugs,
dangerous
and
non-dangerous
drugs.
in
massachusetts,
it
is
perfectly
alright,
to
sell
a
condom
to
a
man
if
he
says
“i
am
unmarried
man”
if
he
is
going
to
use
it
for
purposes
of
venereal
disease
protection,
but
if
he
is
going
to
use
it
for
family
planning
protection
then,
it
is
a
felony.
mr.
joseph
d.
tydings
no,
it
has
not.
mr.
joseph
d.
tydings
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
brennan.
the
right
to
make
a
decision
to
protect
one’s
life
or
to
protect
one’s
health,
is
a
fundamental
personal
constitutional
right
within
the
number
and
certainly
of
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendments
and
the
ninth
amendments
as
described
in
judge
goldberg’s
decision
in
the
griswold
case.
i
think
the
right
not
to
expose
one’s
life,
risk
one’s
life
to
death
or
to
risk
one’s
health
by
being
forced
to
have
an
unwanted
child,
is
a
constitutionally
protected
right.
now,
the
massachusetts
statute
is
arbitrary,
capricious
and
has
no
reasonable
relation
to
a
proper
legislative
purpose
because
it
violates
a
fundamental
personal
right
with
no
compelling
state
reason
and
would
not
a
narrowly
defined
statute.
and
then,
we
go
one
step
further
if
i
might.
there
are
two
possible
reasons
for
the
massachusetts
statute.
the
first
would
be
health
and
yet
how
can
you
argue
this
is
a
health
statute,
if
you
permit
a
married
woman
to
receive
advice
and
prescriptions
from
a
gynecologist
and
you
do
not
permit
an
unmarried
woman.
mr.
joseph
d.
tydings
well,
it
is
still
an
issue
on
the
massachusetts
statute?
mr.
joseph
d.
tydings
no.
there
is
no
evidence,
but
there
was
before
college
audience
--
may
it
please,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
joseph
d.
tydings
well,
it
is.
the
offense
was
there,
but
the
question
of
whether
or
not
he
was
married
or
unmarried
relates
to
the
validity
of
the
statute.
this
statute,
is
inherently
unconstitutional
because
there
is
no
compelling
state
reason
for
it,
and
if
i
may
continue,
i
will
show
some
of
the
absurdities
and
the
contradictions,
which
put
it
clearly
behind
any
justification
either
as
a
health
statute
or
a
moral
statute.
for
instance,
this
statute
--
mr.
joseph
d.
tydings
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
joseph
d.
tydings
exactly.
let
me
take
it
a
step
further
mr.
chief
justice.
this
statute
says,
that
you
cannot
get
a
prescription
for
a
non-prescriptive,
non-dangerous
contraceptive
like
emko
foam
or
a
condom
unless
you
go
to
a
doctor,
unless
the
sole
purpose
is
for
venereal
disease.
so
the
poor
mother,
let
us
say,
the
poor
married
mother
for
the
time
being,
without
regard
to
the
unmarried
woman,
she
is
not
going
to
have
$5
or
$10
to
go
down
to
a
doctor
and
get
a
prescription,
and
go
down
and
get
a
can
of
foam.
i
mean,
that
cuts
off
any
opportunity
for
her
to
protect
her
own
health.
she
might
have
had
four
or
five
children,
it
might
be
very
risky
for
her
to
have
another
one,
and
yet
this
statute,
it
just
arbitrarily
discriminates
against
her.
you
have
got
the
situation
where
until
1966,
mr.
chief
justice,
this
statute
did
not
even
hold
out
any
relationship
to
health
whatsoever.
it
said
that
no
woman,
married
or
unmarried
could
receive
a
contraceptive
from
anyone.
now,
they
put
in
that
second
statutory
clause
about
a
married
woman
and
a
doctor’s
prescription
and
so
forth,
after
the
griswold
decision,
but
they
try
to
tailor
it
absolutely
as
closely
as
they
could
without
any
relationship
to
a
health
measure.
mr.
joseph
d.
tydings
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday
afternoon,
when
the
court
recessed,
we
were
discussing
the
only
possible
interest
of
possible
reasons
for
the
massachusetts
statute
and
the
first,
would
be
the
health
reason
and
i
was
pointing
out
the
absurd
of
these
of
the
statute
and
why
it
was
not
a
health
statute.
and
you
recall,
i
pointed
out
that
it
permitted
a
married
woman
to
be
examined
by
a
doctor,
a
gynecologist,
but
not
an
unmarried
woman.
it
permitted
the—
really
a
rich
married
woman
with
easy
access
to
a
physician
to
get
all
the
prescriptions
she
needed,
but
it
discriminated
against
the
poor
married
woman,
because
it
required
her
to
get
a
prescription
for
a
non
prescriptive
or
a
non
dangerous
drug
or
contraceptive.
i
might
at
this
time,
point
out
to
the
court,
that
the
massachusetts
general
law
at
chapter
270
section
3
at
page
95
prohibits
the
giving
away
of
medicines
or
drugs
injurious
to
the
user,
and
it
incorporates
the
regulations
promulgated
by
the
food
and
drug
administration
of
the
united
states,
and
under
those
regulations,
members
of
the
court,
there
are
certain
contraceptives
which
must
in
massachusetts
and
every
other
state,
be
prescribed
by
a
physician,
for
instance
the
pill,
the
iud
or
the
diaphragm.
but
the
non
dangerous,
the
non
prescriptive
drugs
are
like
the
condom,
like
the
foam,
like
the
vagina
jellies,
they
should
be
issued
in
massachusetts
like
any
other
state.
if
the
massachusetts
legislature
had
an
interest
in
the
health,
they
would
have
put
it
in
here,
but
they
protected
against
the
health.
this
statute
is
purely
and
simply
anti-contraceptive.
let
me
give
you
some
of
the
patent
absurdities.
a
married
woman,
who
has
been
separated
from
her
husband
for
three
or
four
years,
she
can
go,
they
prescribe
and
get
a
contraceptive
for
family
planning
purposes,
despite
the
fact,
she
had
not
seen
her
husband
for
years,
obviously
for
illicit
purposes.
but
the
poor
married
woman
does
not
have
enough
money
to
go
to
the
doctor,
she
can
not.
a
bride,
a
girl
about
to
be
married,
she
can
not
go
to
a
gynaecologist
and
be
prescribed
a
contraceptive,
non
prescriptive
or
any
other
type,
until
after
the
wedding
ceremony
and
she
dashes
from
the
church
to
the
gynaecologist,
to
the
drug
store
and
back
to
the
wedding
reception.
it
is
patently
absurd.
now,
let
us
move
on
to
the
so
called
moral
aspect
of
the
statute.
and
if
you
were
to
assume
there
was
a
moral
reason,
it
would
be
i
assume
to
restrain
or
deter
fornication.
but
how
could
they
permit,
if
that
was
the
desire,
how
can
they
draw
a
statute
which
would
permit
a
married
woman
who
had
been
either
separated
from
the
husband
or
wife
had
been
away
for
two
or
three
years,
in
the
process
of
a
divorce,
a
divorce
decree
not
final,
how
could
she
go
down
and
get
a
contraceptive
for
family
planning
purposes?
and
a
young
married
woman
could
not.
if
there
was
really
a
deterring
effect,
why
would
not
you
increase
the
statute
from
a
misdemeanor?
fornication
in
massachusetts
is
a
misdemeanor,
90
days.
whereas
the
selling
of
a
non
prescriptive,
non
dangerous
contraceptive
for
family
planning
purposes
to
an
unmarried
person,
that
is
five
years.
it
is
a
felony.
that
they
were
really
concerned
with
deterring
the
illicit
or
pre-marital
intercourse,
and
they
would
increase
the
fornication
statute
from
a
misdemeanor
90
days,
and
they
would
enforce
the
law
as
it
exists.
mr.
joseph
d.
tydings
in
my
understanding
it
is.
mr.
joseph
d.
tydings
and
yet
this
—
mr.
joseph
d.
tydings
i
do
not
know.
mr.
joseph
d.
tydings
i
can
not
answer
that
(voice
overlap).
mr.
joseph
d.
tydings
that
is
right.
so,
if
adultery
or
the
restrain
of
adultery
is
a
purpose,
it
is
completely
vitiated
by
the
language
of
the
statute.
the
real
trust
to
the
statute
—
may
it
please
the
court
is
it
is
—
it
is
a
hold
over
from
the
constakien(ph)
days.
it
was
originally
and
until
1966,
it
was
designed
to
prevent
any
person,
married
or
unmarried
from
using
a
contraceptive
in
the
state
of
massachusetts.
after
the
griswold
case,
they
amended
it
as
narrowly
as
possible
to
try
and
come
within
the
contlines
of
the
griswold
case.
but,
it
is
not
a
health
statute
and
it
is
really
not
a
justifiable
moral
statute.
may
it
please
the
court,
i
think
the
cases
uniformly
hold
when
you
are
dealing
with
a
fundamental
personal
right,
and
i
think
there
is
a
fundamental
personal
right
here,
namely,
the
right
of
an
individual
or
woman
not
to
have
an
unwanted
pregnancy
which
maybe
dangerous
to
her
health
or
life,
then
you
have
got
to
show
a
compelling
interest,
and
it
has
got
to
be
narrowly
defined
in
the
state
of
massachusetts,
meets
neither
of
these.
but
even
more,
the
massachusetts
statute
violates
the
strong
interest
of
society
and
the
people
of
massachusetts
and
that
interest
is
to
protect
the
health
and
safety
of
a
mother
and
a
child,
be
that
mother
married
or
unmarried,
there
is
a
strong
interest
to
protect
the
health
and
safety
of
the
child.
there
is
a
strong
interest
to
society
in
massachusetts
to
prevent
unwanted
pregnancies
and
there
is
a
strong
interest
in
the
state
of
massachusetts
to
prevent
unwanted
and
illegitimate
children
being
brought
in
the
world.
and
look
what
the
statute
does?
i
mean,
look
at
the
damage
caused
by
unwanted
pregnancies.
take
the
mother
to
begin
with,
the
mother
and
i
might
say
that
in
the
state
or
massachusetts
from
the
period
of
1964,
i
think
1966-1968,
31%
of
the
white
children
conceived
in
the
state
of
massachusetts
where
conceived
out
of
wedlock,
and
64%
of
the
non
white
children
where
conceived
out
of
wedlock.
now
let
us
not
say
they
were
illegitimate,
because
the
illegitimacy
rate
was
i
think
6%
in
massachusetts.
but
they
were
conceived
out
of
wedlock.
so
as
far
as
any
deterrent
effect,
it
does
not
have
any.
but
look
at
the
consequences
to
the
unmarried
mother.
first
of
all,
she
is
likely
—
if
she
has
—
if
she
is
so
desperate
that
she
does
not
—
she
can
not
have
a
child,
she
will
go
to
some
black
abortionist,
particularly
if
she
is
poor,
perhaps,
inflict
on
herself
some
grave
and
serious
physical
injury,
she
is
likely
to
die.
if
she
does
have
a
child
then
she
is
illegitimate.
it
puts
her
in
a
cycle
from
which
she
may
never
recover.
you
know,
i
think
as
well
as
i,
the
whole
social
problems
of
our
nation
with
respect
to
the
poor,
unwanted
child
in
a
welfare
mother.
but
once
she
gets
in
that
cycle,
it
is
almost
impossible
to
get
out.
her
whole
life
is
committed
from
that
point
on.
the
health
consequences
to
the
—
particularly
the
poor
unmarried
mother
are
great.
you
have
a
far
higher,
maternal
death
rate
from
the
unmarried
mother
than
you
do
from
the
married
mother.
and,
let
us
look
at
the
child.
the
child
born
out
of
wedlock,
and
the
brief,
may
it
please
the
court
by
mrs.
harriet
pilpel
for
the
planned
parenthood
on
from
pages
20-26,
very
exquisite
insights,
all
of
the
studies,
hew
now
for
which
backup
the
back
to,
i
am
going
to
just
comment
on
you,
i
am
sure
that
you
know
them
anyway,
but
it
is
very
excellent
presentation
in
this
brief.
but
take
the
child,
you
got
the
higher
death
rate
of
children
born
out
of
wedlock,
higher
premature
births,
a
higher
infant
mortality
in
the
first
year.
the
greater
likelihood
of
disease
and
mental
retardation,
and
of
course
the
most
—
the
saddest
and
really
the
most
tragic
thing
of
all,
the
greater
likelihood
of
child
abuse,
child
beating
and
all
the
type
of
anti-social
activities
which
contribute
to
making
that
child
a
ward
of
society
from
then
on.
now
finally,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
it
is
the
strong
interest
in
society
in
the
state
of
massachusetts,
to
prevent
unwanted,
illegitimate
children
from
being
born,
because
these
poor
children,
with
many
instances
no
father,
many
instances
the
mother
maybe
three
or
four
illegitimate
children
already.
what
chance
do
they
have
to
make
it
in
our
life?
they
just
do
not
have
a
chance?
and
if
you
look
at
the
statistics
in
your
institutions
whether
they
are
mental
institutions,
whether
they
are
penal
institutions,
you
will
find
that
the
prevalence
of
the
unwanted
child
without
the
father
is
right
up
at
the
top.
and
that
was
a
whole
trust
and
reasoning
for
the
entire
legislative
program.
if
the
congress
is
passed
during
the
past
six
or
seven
years,
beginning
with
the
lel
act
in
64,
the
67th
amendment,
the
social
security
act,
and
finally,
the
family
planning
act
of
1970.
in
may
of
this
year,
hew
announced
in
the
state
of
massachusetts,
that
they
are
going
to
fund
four
major
projects
for
low
income
families
and
low
boston,
springfield
and
one
other
area
in
the
state
of
massachusetts
under
the
1970
act,
and
the
course
the
regulation
say
that
if
you
cannot
discriminate
between
married
and
unmarried.
now,
what
happens
if
this
statute
is
held
constitutional?
you
are
going
to
mean
that
in
the
state
of
massachusetts
and
all
the
nine
hospitals
involved
for
low
income
mothers.
you
are
going
to
say
sorry
to
the
unmarried
mother
who
might
to
have
four
or
five
illegitimate
children
already.
the
next
birth
may
send
her
to
cause
grave
physical
injury,
even
death
you
can
say,
i
am
sorry,
but
we
can
not
prescribe
you
because
you
are
unmarried?
i
mean,
that
is
patently
against
the
best
interest
of
the
state
of
massachusetts,
it
is
against
the
whole
trust
of
federal
legislation.
it
is
an
outdated
anachronism
from
a
statute
back
in
1870's
which
has
no
business
being
on
the
statute
books
today.
