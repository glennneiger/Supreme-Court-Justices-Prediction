justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
should
think
he
has
got
the
--
could
he
possibly
have
a
greater
interest?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
--
excuse
me,
i
thought
he
filed
a
petition
for
federal
habeas
corpus
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
his
detention
by
massachusetts,
on
the
ground
of
the
underlying
statute
is
unconstitutional.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
are
suggesting
he
does
not
have
standing
to
do
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
he
says,
the
law
may
not
restrict
the
distribution
of
contraceptive
devices
to
physicians.
it
is
unconstitutional
in
that
respect
(voice

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask?
i
read
the
opinion
and
am
i
correct
that
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit,
the
first
amendment
arguments
were
rejected
as
an
attack
on
the
merits
of
constitutional
question
and
the
court
found
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
on
quite
different
grounds.
no
rational
relation
(voice
overlap).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
if
that
is
correct,
what
moment
is
that
--
we
urge
again
to
turn
this
on
first
amendment
grounds,
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
on
the
grounds
it
took,
and
then
(voice
overlap).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
certainly
not
has
standing,
so
a
certain
constitutional
arguments
that
he
did
assert
and
in
which
he
prevail
in
the
first
circuit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
they
have
rejected
his
first
amendment
ground,
i
suggest
by
reading
the
appendix
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
they
turned
it
on
an
entirely
different
constitution
in
terms
as
they
saw
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
they
--
is
there
any
suggestion
on
your
part,
they
did
not
have
standing
to
raise
these
other
constitution
contentions?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
am
sorry.
do
that
again.
i
just
do
not
follow
you,
so.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
do
hope
that
you
are
going
to
get
to
the
ground
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
rely
on
in
holding
the
statute?
just
in
a
moment
i
would.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
it
the
preemption
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
has
been
made
in
your
brief?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
do
not
have
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
excuse
me,
i
do
not
have
it.
i
did
not
get
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
is
why
i
am
just
not
familiar
with
the
preemption
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
your
time
is
running
out
mr.
tydings
because
it
is
afternoon,
but
i
just
want
to
ask
a
few
questions,
i
just
got
it
at
the
top
of
your
brief
then?
i
take,
if
the
state
has
not
answered
to
this
additional
question,
have
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
gather
this
argument
was
not
made
in
any
court
below,
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
that
is
the
ground
that
the
court
of
appeals
took?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
the
only
possible
justification
because
that
would
be
held
for
morals
and
on
the
court
of
the
appeals
an
analysis
was
needed,
therefore
it
was
completely
void?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
should
think
he
has

the

he
