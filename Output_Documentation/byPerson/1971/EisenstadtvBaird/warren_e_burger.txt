mr.
nolan,
suppose
the
massachusetts
set
a
statute
and
said
that
it
was
illegal
for
anyone
to
prescribe
the
use
of
or
to
hand
to
any
person,
any
quantity
of
wheat
germ,
for
example,
or
some
other
innocuous
substance
unless
the
person
handing
it
or
engaging
in
that
act
was
a
registered
physician?
and
when
he
gives
some
wheat
germ
away
and
he
is
arrested,
he
has
standing
to
challenge
that
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
different
from
this
one
in
that
respect?
chief
justice
warren
e.

now
you
are
going
to
the
merits,
are
you
not,
rather
than
just
the
question
of
standing
chief

warren
e.

his
point
of
view,
that
is
all
i
am
addressing
my
hypothetical
--
from
his
point
of
view,
perhaps
the
situation,
a
wheat
germ
is
exactly
the
same?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
we
reach
the
merits
of
the
validity
of
your
position
about
the
possible
harmful
effect
on
just
the
standing
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
thought
mr.
nolan,
that
your
strongest
point
really
was
that
the
police
power
was
being
exercised
here
with
the
state
of
massachusetts
to
protect
people
from
harmful
substances
at
the
hands
of
non-physicians.
you
do
not
contend
that,
do
you?
chief
