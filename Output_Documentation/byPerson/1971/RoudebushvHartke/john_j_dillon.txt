mr.
john
j.
dillon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
i
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
just
review
the
atmosphere
that
surrounded
this
law
suit
so
that
you
might
understand
the
factual
situation
and
unlike
many
of
the
cases
that
have
been
argued
here
today,
this
was
a
factual
situation
in
which
facts
were
presented.
a
credible
witness
was
presented
and
the
facts
were
uncontroverted.
so,
the
facts
underlying
this
case
as
shown
in
our
appendix
are
extremely
important.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
in
the
federal
court.
evidence
was
introduced
in
the
federal
court,
the
thrust
of
which
proved
that
this
was
in
fact
a
contest.
be
it
aroused
by
any
other
name,
but
what
is
done
in
indiana
is
in
fact
a
contest.
that
evidence
by
credible
witness
uncontroverted
was
introduced
and
is
in
the
appendix.
now,
here
was
the
situation.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
in
the
state
court?
the
state
court
sir
was
the
petition
for
a
recount
under
the
state
statute.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
it
was
a
contest
as
the
indiana
supreme
court
has
three
times
held
declaring
this
very
statute
to
be
unconstitutional,
before
it
was
amended
and
after
it
was
amended
wherein
the
argument
is
made
it
well.
after
the
amendment,
it
became
a
discovery
statute.
but
in
fact
in
bachelorette
(ph)
cited
by
the
our
court,
our
supreme
court,
the
indiana
supreme
court
said
“it
violates
article
4
section
10
of
the
constitution
of
indiana,
which
is
the
mirror
image
of
article
1
section
5
of
the
federal
constitution”.
so,
three
times,
our
highest
court
that
struck
down
this
statute
as
saying
that
it
could
not
apply
to
the
members
of
the
indiana
general
assembly.
now,
there
are
4,400
precincts
in
indiana.
they
petitioned
in
11
counties.
440
precincts
and
11
counties
are
4,000
plus
precincts.
in
one
of
the
counties
in
one
in
which
the
principal
case
came
up
into
the
federal
court,
came
over
in
the
federal
court,
it
was
fragmentary,
just
part
of
the
precincts.
now,
the
court
was
moving.
commissioners
were
been
appointed.
33
commissioners
were
being
appointed
in
33
different
state
jurisdictions.
as
shown
by
the
evidence
and
by
the
law
of
indiana,
the
appellant’s
party
control
every
precinct
in
indiana,
all
4,400
of
them.
by
that
i
mean,
the
judge
and
the
inspector
in
the
majority
party
which
was
appellants
control
every
precinct,
giving
them
the
opportunity
to
make
the
original
judgment
as
state
of
a
counsel
as
each
person
came
to
the
polling
place.
in
marian
county,
the
election
board
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
his
party
had
cast
a
highest
number
of
votes
at
the
previous
election
was
controlled
by
appellant’s
party.
the
canvassing
board
which
does
check
arithmetical
errors
was
controlled
by
appellant’s
party.
now,
in
that
atmosphere
and
i
must
be
candid
to
tell
you,
every
judge
in
indiana
at
this
time
was
also
selected
on
the
partisan
political
ballot.
right
along
with
the
county
treasurer
and
the
county
clerk,
and
our
supreme
court
and
appellate
court
judges
are
like
wise
selected.
so,
you
can
see
the
atmosphere
in
the
united
states
senate
raise
between
two
strong
political
parties.
now,
that
was
the
atmosphere,
and
the
recount
proceeded.
alright,
it
was
at
that
point
that
we
had
to
look
at
the
indiana
statute
on
recounts,
which
has
been
thrice
declared
to
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
article
4
section
10
of
the
indiana
constitution
which
says,
the
general
assembly
shall
be
the
judge
of
the
election
qualifications
and
returns
of
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
a
mirror
image
of
the
article
1
section
5
it
says,
“united
states
senate
will
be
the
judge
of
the
election
returns
of
the
qualifications
of
a
senator.”
alright!
mr.
john
j.
dillon
i
can
not
see
how
logically
it
could
prove,
otherwise,
there
is
no
decision
at
any
place
that
says
that
this
is
not
true
that
i
confine
that
if
you
get
in
to
the
the
judge
and
the
senator’s
race,
the
jurisdiction
is
in
the
senate.
now,
these
recount
commissions
were
proceeding
to
judge
the
senatorial
race.
that
is
the
thrust
of
this
law
suit.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
oh,
yes.
jurisdiction
was
predicated
on
1343
a,
and
article
1
section
5
of
the
constitution.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
well,
mr.
john
j.
dillon
that
question
was
never
raised
in
the
trial
court.
but
i
say
this,
we
are
here
now
as
the
appellees.
and
if
the
judgment
was
solid,
then
it
was
solid.
and
i
say
that
in
the
powell
versus
mccormick,
this
court
said
that
the
jurisdiction
under
the
1331
a,
the
general
jurisdiction
statute
is
valid.
so
if
that
be
true,
then
we
are
entitled
to
the
position
because
we
are
here
as
the
appellees,
and
we
got
the
article.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
2283?
i
will
get
to
it
and
you
want
me
to
reach
this
now?
mr.
john
j.
dillon
alright.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
yes
sir.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
yes
sir.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
we
do
not
consider
the
state
court
and
it
was
just
a
trial
court
which
i
will
get
to.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
no
i
suppose
--
there
was
a
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter,
i
would
so
concede.
nevertheless
it
was
not
argued.
i
mean
the
lack
of
the
pleading
position
was
not
argued
and
the
court
mentioned,
title
42
1983,
and
the
court
here
--
assume
that
we
are
correct,
that
we
all
would
agree,
if
we
could
agree
to
that
that
there
was
a
clear
violation
of
article
1
section
5.
then
1443(3)
says
if
the
law
provides,
we
can
go
into
district
court
and
get
relief.
alright.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
do
what
sir?
mr.
john
j.
dillon
that
is
the
supreme
court
of
indiana’s
position?
sir,
that
i
view
that
to
be
their
position.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
no
sir.
three
times,
they
have
said
and
the
last
time
being
that
in
the
case
of
a
member
of
the
indiana
legislature
that
this
statute
was
unconstitutional.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
yes
sir.
three
times
the
supreme
court
struck
down
the
very
statute.
now,
the
only
basis
that
they
consent
--
mr.
john
j.
dillon
sir?
mr.
john
j.
dillon
that
the
members
of
the
legislature
of
the
united
states
senate
or
congress.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
yes.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
yes.
because
dogcatcher
is
not
prescribed
by
article
1
section
5,
or
section
--
mr.
john
j.
dillon
not
the
governor.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
the
governor,
because
you
see,
when
they
amended
a
statute,
they
said
the
lieutenant
governor,
the
governor
and
members
of
the
general
assembly,
mr.
john
j.
dillon
yes,
you
could
permit.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
judges
are
elected
on
the
partisan
political
ballot.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
for
judge?
either
could
be.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
i
think
so.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
well,
i
say
that
the
court
was
justified.
there
is
no
logical
difference
between
the
rationality
of
the
indiana
court’s
deciding
that
a
member
of
a
legislature
cannot
be
contested
except
in
the
legislature
than
saying
a
member
of
the
united
states
senate
cannot
be
contested
anywhere
except
in
the
senate,
and
the
reasoning
in
the
cases
cited
in
batchelet,
beaman,
acker
in
the
indiana
cases
which
we
relied
upon
are
identical
with
the
reasonings
in
barry
versus
cunningham,
mr.
john
j.
dillon
that
is
true,
that
is
true.
well,
i
know
legal
historical
precedent
where
that
is
true
your
honor.
in
each
case,
there
is
no
precedent
that
says
it
was
a
matter
of
contest,
it
does
not
belong
in
the
legislative
body.
be
it
the
state
assembly
or
be
it
the
national
congress.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
precisely,
your
honor.
precisely,
and
i
say
that
our
evidence
shows
--
mr.
john
j.
dillon
that
there
is
a
contest
and
the
supreme
court
of
indiana,
three
times
said
it
was
unconstitutional.
that
is
the
only
basis
it
will
be
unconstitutional.
it
attempted
the
judge
derive
a
member
of
the
indiana
general
assembly
under
article
4
section
10
of
the
indiana
constitution
which
is
identical
to
article
1
section
5
of
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
if
the
statute
provided
for
a
simply
arithmetical
determination
as
a
canvassing
board
did
in
this
case
and
incidentally
did
make
some
mathematical
changes
in
the
very
county
in
question
and
forwarded
those,
that
is
one
thing.
but
the
evidence
was
and
the
fact
is
that
they
perceived
to
get
into
the
paper
ballots.
and
they
perceived
to
make
judgments
again
on
how
the
precinct
people
counted
these
ballots.
and
the
undisputed
evidence
was
and
the
fact
is
and
even
in
our
court’s
decisions
they
even
have
printed
where
the
supreme
court
judges
have
said
will
add
access
too
far
and
that
check
is
wrong.
so,
that
is
where
we
get
into
the
judgment
quality
of
the
statute.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
but
our
statute
does
not
so
provide.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
they
should.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
yes
sir.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
that
by
all
--
mr.
john
j.
dillon
yes
sir.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
yes.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
they
have
a
count
here.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
and
they
had
a
certificate
presented
by
the
secretary
of
state
to
the
governor,
and
by
the
governor,
the
senator
hartke
and
presented
by
senator
hartke
to
the
united
states
senate,
they
have
a
count.
now,
to
go
behind
that
count,
if
the
statute
provided
for
a
pure
arithmetical
recounting,
that
is
one
thing.
but
the
evidence
here
was
and
the
fact
was
and
our
indiana
supreme
court
has
three
times
found
that
it
is
a
contest
when
get
into
the
judging
the
validity
of
these
ballots
for
--
member
of
the
general
assembly
or
the
united
states
senate
or
congress.
i
think
that
logically
follows
because
those
precedents
were
footed
and
founded
upon
the
same
principles.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
that
does.
it
does.
that
comes
under
article
1
section
4.
you
got
to
start
some
place.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
it
is.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
it
does,
those
three
people,
appointed
by
congressman
or
other
political
party
did
do
that.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
they
can
not
judge
the
ballots,
they
can
recount
the
ballots.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
they
did.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
because
that
is
not
a
continuation
of
the
election
process
under
article
1
section
4.
that
becomes
--
mr.
john
j.
dillon
yes,
provided
only
--
mr.
john
j.
dillon
ah,
that
is
the
counting
and
the
first
time
counting.
the
second
time,
argument
on
a
laxalt
candidate
and
the
wickersham
case
and
if
that
is
all
they
did
was
count
them,
fine.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
quite
to
the
contrary.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
quite
to
the
contrary,
as
the
evidence
showed,
they
are
making
a
judgment
on
what
was
done
at
the
precinct
polling
place
and
as
the
evidence
showed,
there
was
no
way
to
unscramble
that,
and
that
is
wherein
the
irreparable
harm
was.
they
could
never
get
to
the
senate
and
determine
how
that
judgment
was
made
by
the
recount
commission
if
that
evidence
was
not
maintained
until
it
went
to
the
united
states
senate.
and
interestingly
enough,
a
year
has
passed
over
and
no
petition
has
even
been
presented
to
the
united
states
senate
by
the
appellant
here
in,
asking
for
a
contest
of
this
election.
now,
it
is
of
course,
argument
on
article
1
section
4,
article
1
section
5,
but
our
evidence
showed
that
this
violated
article
1
section
5.
it
got
into
the
prerogatives
of
the
senate.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
because
the
evidence
would
be
irreparably
commingled
and
it
would
be
impossible
for
the
senate
to
determine
how
the
recount
commission
viewed
what
the
precinct
commission
did.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
the
senate
has
no
specific
rules
on
it.
they
proceed
ad
hoc
on
these
matters
but
that
is
the
custom.
yes.
let
me
say
this.
it
has
been
done
in
senatorial
recount
or
contest
cases.
but
that
was
part
of
our
equity
that
we
felt
like
we
were
entitled
to
and
three-judge
court
so
ruled
that
once
these
recount
commissioner
started
re-judging,
and
said
oh,
no,
the
evidence
all
carefully
lays
out
exactly
how
this
was
done
and
how
that
they
got
into
these
paper
ballots,
which
went
all
the
precincts.
some
paper
ballots
and
the
all
the
precincts.
now,
the
machine,
you
see
is
no
problem,
and
the
machines
make
arithmetical
count.
but
on
the
paper
ballots
when
they
come
in
from
the
precincts,
that
is
a
far
different
thing.
some
are
in
the
counted
bags
as
the
evidence
shows.
some
are
rejected
bags.
now,
these
commissioners
proceed
to
the
redo
that.
one
of
the
counties,
even
though
the
states
statute
requires
the
whole
counting
to
be
machine,
wayne
county
as
the
evidence
showed
was
all
on
paper
ballots.
so,
here
we
have
all
of
these
commissions,
11
different
commission
proceeding
to
make
judgments
on
these
ballots
which
were
passed,
and
the
court
found
are
the
evidence
that
that
belonged
in
the
united
states
senate.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
well,
i
have
found
that
in
every
case
where
it
violated
article
1
section
5,
they
have
said
that
they
could
not
permit
it
to
go
forward.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
well,
in
laxalt
versus
canon,
they
said
that
they
granted
the
relief
there
and
then
went
on
and
there
was
recount
before
the
contest
you
see.
there
was
no
question
raised
about
the
recount
and
laxalt
versus
canon
went
on
to
say
that
the
senate
is
the
judge
under
article
1
section
5.
so
presumably
in
laxalt
versus
canon,
if
there
had
been
--
if
in
fact,
their
recount
was
a
kind
of
a
recount
we
have,
and
that
is
what
is
the
essence
of
this
law
suit,
what
this
recount
constitutes,
and
we
say
it
constitutes
a
contest
and
our
supreme
court
of
indiana
three
times
said
the
same
thing
as
we
see
it.
we
can
not
see
how
there
is
any
cavil
in
that
argument.
but
nevertheless
it
has
been
raised
and
we
are
trying
to
meet
it.
now,
we
went
into
federal
court
and
made
a
federal
constitutional
claim,
a
federal
constitutional
claim.
article
1
section
5
of
the
constitution.
there
was
no
underlying
state
question
involved
because
if
the
state
--
law
question
was
clear
as
we
see
it,
three
times
the
supreme
court
had
said
that
it
was
not
a
viable
statute
so
far
as
the
state
legislature
was
concerned.
now,
we
think
it
is
only
reasonable
if
that
be
true
and
now
with
the
underlying
constitutional
basis,
that
that
certainly
is
true,
the
office
of
the
united
states
senate.
now,
motions
were
filed
under
2283
in
the
federal
court.
we
met
those
and
we
meet
them
now
in
theory
that
this
is
not
the
type
of
proceedings
that
2283
prohibits
granting
an
injunction
against.
these
commissioners
--
this
is
not
court
litigation
because
there
is
no
appeal
in
indiana
from
a
recount.
there
is
no
appeal.
you
can
not
do
anything
and
yet
(voice

mr.
john
j.
dillon
writ
of
prohibition.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
the
state
court
remedy
used
in
the
batchelet
--
mr.
john
j.
dillon
alright,
i
will
explain
this.
first
of
all,
why
do
we
go
writ
of
prohibition?
all
through
the
brief,
i
indicate
that
writ
of
prohibition
is
the
simple
remedy.
well,
that
depends
on
what
the
factual
situation
is
and
how
fast
things
are
moving.
now,
indiana
writ
of
prohibition
or
the
rules
of
our
procedure
requires
that
--
first
of
all,
if
an
emergency
writ
is
not
granted
and
it
is
very
difficult
to
get
emergency
writ,
then
the
petition
for
the
temporary
writ
of
prohibition
and
alternative
writ
of
mandate
must
lay
over
seven
days.
and,
that
the
only
hearing
would
be
2
o’clock
on
monday.
alright,
now
if
you
file
on
tuesday
and
you
do
not
get
a
hearing
on
you
temporary
emergency,
then
you
could
be
put
off
13
days.
now
this
two
courts
had
overruled
us.
our
motion
dismissed
on
the
ground
they
where
violating
article
1
section
5
with
the
federal
constitution,
not
the
state
constitution.
so,
we
went
to
federal
court
to
get
a
restraining
order
to
stop
it,
to
hold
it
and
see
whether
we
were
right
--
mr.
john
j.
dillon
yes.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
sir?
mr.
john
j.
dillon
if
the
court
ruled,
as
we
can
get
the
court
to
hear
it.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
change
the
law.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
yes.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
for
two
reasons.
we
thought
that
under
the
fact
situation,
it
was
our
judgment
that
writ
of
prohibition
was
not
an
expeditious
remedy
but
more
importantly
before
this
court,
we
do
not
think
we
had
exhausted
this
straight
remedy
where
we
could
go
into
the
federal
court
or
federal
question
without
an
underlying
state
question.
we
did
not
see
any
question
of
abstention
or
comity
involved
in
this.
so,
we
went
to
federal
court.
we
got
a
restraining
order
and
then
we
got
a
temporary
injunction
after
a
full
scale
hearing
where
evidence
was
had.
now,
the
question
said
was
there
any
indiana
precedents
and
say
that
this
is
a
ministerial
proceedings?
and
the
answer
to
that
is
yes.
there
are
two
precedents
cited
in
our
brief.
watson
versus
biggs
(ph)
and
state
ex
rel
mccormick.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
both.
they
are
intermixed
but
they
say
that
they
are
not
the
part
of
animal
that
we
say,
we
are
talking
about
in
a
2283
prohibition
against
that
grant
them
injunction.
and,
we
cite
many
authorities
and
there
is
court
deposition
that
these
were
not
proceedings
in
the
state
court
which
were
specifically
prohibited
under
younger.
certainly,
they
are
criminal
prosecutions
and
watson
versus
pig
and
the
state
ex
rel
mccormick,
one
was
a
prosecutor
and
one
was
a
county
auditor,
and
they
described
these
people
as
a
ministerial
and
i
believe
counsel
in
appellant's
brief
concedes
or
at
least
argues
the
same
way
that
these
are
ministerial
proceedings,
not
judicial
proceedings,
or
that
they
are
not
judicial
proceedings.
now,
the
next
question
is
of
course,
does
john
reply?
we
say
no.
we
say
it
does
not
apply
for
a
reason
that
these
are
not
state
court
proceedings
under
2283.
and,
i
would
like
to
also
cite
the
case
of
hobbs
versus
thompson
which
was
previously
cited
because
again,
it
was
not
exactly
a
2283
case
but
it
does
give
an
excellent
review
of
what
the
younger
decisions
made
were
called
at
this
february
sac
state
decisions
in
younger.
and,
judge
goldberg
in
that
case
which
has
been
previously
cited
here
gives
his
view,
a
very
rational
view
of
the
application
of
2283.
now,
after
this
case
was
tried
and
here
in
comes
a
--
mr.
john
j.
dillon
15
minutes
as
per
my
computation.
at
anyway,
prior
to
the
taking
--
first
of
all,
the
issue
the
(inaudible)
issue,
hartke
presented
himself
on
january
21
he
was
seated.
the
senator
curtis
motion
said
that
he
would
be
seated
with
unanimous
consent
without
prejudice
to
this
appeal
pending
in
the
supreme
court
and
recognizing
that
this
supreme
court
might
order
a
recount,
to
that
effect.
now,
i
suggest
you
to
that
language
is
completely
nugatory.
it
means
nothing.
senator
hartke
is
seated
just
like
every
other
senator.
he
seated
savvy
to
article
1
section
5
of
the
constitution.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
that
is
my
next
point.
we
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss,
and
we
cited
barry
versus
cunningham.
now,
it
is
1929
case
involving
senator
beyer.
but
the
fact
is
as
far
as
i
can
see,
that
case
is
not
been
in
anyway
trampled
upon
any
of
these
decisions.
and
every
decision
underlying
the
state
court,
be
they
federal
or
be
they
state
court
or
be
they
state
legislature
or
be
they
federal
legislature,
when
the
senator
or
the
assembly
men
seats
himself
and
is
seated,
then,
then
this
thing
moves
into
that
body.
and,
that
is
what
senator
beyer
said,
that
is
what
the
barry
versus
cunningham
involving
senator
beyer
said.
he
was
seated,
and
this
matter
is
now
for
the
united
states
senate
to
determine.
i
can
not
see
what
can
be
done
at
this
point.
except,
let
this
matter
go
to
the
united
states
senate.
now,
there
is
quarrel
because
we
went
to
federal
district
court
to
press
a
federal
claim,
a
federal
constitutional
claim
under
article
1
section
5.
i
raised
the
question,
why
does
not
the
appellant
go
after
year
to
the
united
states
senate
where
he
could
get
all
the
relief
that
he
could
ask
for
if
he
convinced
the
senate
that
he
is
correct
in
his
position.
so,
there
is
not
really
that
this
case
is
not
moot.
it
was
not
a
case
when
we
tried
it
in
the
federal
district
court,
but
once
he
became
seated
at
the
united
states
senate
under
the
rule
of
barry
versus
cunningham,
this
case
is
moot.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
what
could
he
do
now?
mr.
john
j.
dillon
oh,
i
take
a
petition
to
senate
and
ask
for
a
recount.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
i
think
they
could,
yes
sir.
i
think
you
see,
mr.
john
j.
dillon
article
1
section
5?
yes
sir.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
you
mean
if
they
--
mr.
john
j.
dillon
well,
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
expulsion,
i
think
it
would
be
a
majority
vote
situation,
where
they
found
that
he
was
not
elected,
that
is
the
normal
procedure.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
yes
sir.
he
has
been
seated,
january
21
of
--
mr.
john
j.
dillon
that
of
course
is
our
position
and
we
filed
a
motion
--
mr.
john
j.
dillon
well,
i
do
not
know
what
the
senate
can
do
because
they
adopt
different
rules
on
these
cases
as
they
go
along.
you
see
and
i
hate
to
say
it
--
mr.
john
j.
dillon
but
i
know
that
he
had
been
seated?
mr.
john
j.
dillon
yes
sir,
and
of
course,
we
will
raise
a
doctrine
of
laches,
if
we
get
to
the
senate
a
year
later
because
the
fact
is,
these
machines
have
been
cleared
and
pictures
have
been
taken
--
but
that
is
not
before
this
court.
but,
the
jurisdictional
question
under
article
1
section
5,
is
certainly
here.
he
has
been
seated,
just
like
every
other
senator
and
this
language
in
the
senator
curtis
motion
has
no
constitutional
effect.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
i
would
hope
so
your
honor.
that
would
be
a
new
departure
in
some
regard,
i
suppose.
but
seriously,
i
do
not
think
it
means
a
thing
constitutionally.
i
think
he
seats
there
just
every
other
senator
subject
to
be
in
crude
that
he
was
not
elected
and
the
place
that
you
prude
that
in
the
united
state
senate.
now,
that
is
the
ruling
precedent
at
this
court
in
barry
versus
cunningham.
and,
the
remarkable
thing
even
the
late
cases
be
the
laxalt
or
be
there
wickersham,
when
they
get
in
this
--
mr.
john
j.
dillon
alright.
but
they
all
fall
back
deceited.
the
constitutional
provision
in
every
state
is
very
nearly
identical
to
the
federal
constitution
provision
article
1
section
5.
and,
they
all
fall
back
to
the
same
argument.
well,
the
legislative
body
is
the
judge
of
the
election,
returns
and
qualifications
of
the
member.
now,
we
are
talking
about
the
election
returns
and
qualifications
of
the
united
states
senator,
why
should
they
not
be
presented
to
the
united
state
senate?
why
should
it
not
be
presented
there
in
the
first
instance?
we
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
this
court,
the
court
deferred
the
jurisdictional
question
till
the
day
as
i
understand
it,
and
i
want
to
press
strongly
to
the
point
that
he
is
seated
in
under
barry
versus
cunningham
that
i
believe
that
in
(inaudible)
this
case,
i
think
it
is
moot.
i
do
not
think
anything
could
be
done.
the
state
recounts
as
in
the
various
--
there
are
all
kinds
of
different
cases
on
them.
some
say
they
are
valid
and
some
say
they
are
not,
and
you
have
to
look
at
the
various
state
laws
to
determine
whether
they
would
be
valid
measures
in
article
1
section
5.
but
look
at
our
recount
statute
and
what
laxalt
v.
cannon
says
about
nevada’s
case
and
what
wickersham
says
about
the
case
in
that
state
or
the
minnesota
case.
we
know
what
the
indiana
courts
upheld.
they
have
held
the
statute
unconstitutional,
that
it
violates
article
1
section
5.
now,
the
trial
court
did
mention
as
i
said
title
421983
of
the
civil
rights
act.
we
trouble
ourselves
with
this
question.
how
do
you
go
in?
assuming
we
are
right
that
out
here
is
a
body,
a
ministerial
body
actually
violating
the
senate’s
prerogatives
article
1
section
5
which
we
thought
we
proved
and
the
court
thought
we
proved
and
the
evidence
shows
it.
we
meticulously
put
the
evidence
in.
so,
we
would
not
get
up
here
and
say
well,
it
is
a
facial
argument.
on
its
face
they
say
recount.
so
if
on
its
face
it
says
recount,
if
you
can
count
them
once,
you
can
count
them
twice
argument.
so,
we
said
we
got
to
prove
that
you
do
not
do
that,
and
we
did
prove
it
and
the
court
so
found
that
this
is
a
contest.
that
moves
it
in
to
article
1
section
5,
that
moves
it
in
to
the
senate.
the
important
thing,
i
think
that
there
is
no
question
that
the
fact
shows
that
the
congressman,
appellant
hartke
and
appellant
roudebush
had
controlled
the
polling
places
as
party.
had
control
of
the
recount
commission,
had
control
of
the
canvassing
board.
now
they
wanted
to
get
into
a
further
contest.
they
wanted
to
go
in
to
11
separate
counties,
isolated
precincts
at
some
case
and
rehash
those
judges.
the
court
found
properly
as
the
indiana
supreme
court
had
found
three
times
that
that
violated
article
1
section
5.
we
do
not
think
it
is
a
question
of
exhaustion
of
state
remedies.
we
do
not
think
the
writ
of
prohibition
was
necessary,
we
think
we
can
go
the
federal
court
and
press
a
federal
claim
where
there
is
no
uncertainty
in
the
state
law.
and,
we
did
so.
thank
you
your
honors.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
i
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
just
review
the
atmosphere
that
surrounded
this
law
suit
so
that
you
might
understand
the
factual
situation
and
unlike
many
of
the
cases
that
have
been
argued
here
today,
this
was
a
factual
situation
in
which
facts
were
presented.
a
credible
witness
was
presented
and
the
facts
were
uncontroverted.
so,
the
facts
underlying
this
case
as
shown
in
our
appendix
are
extremely
important.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
in
the
federal
court.
evidence
was
introduced
in
the
federal
court,
the
thrust
of
which
proved
that
this
was
in
fact
a
contest.
be
it
aroused
by
any
other
name,
but
what
is
done
in
indiana
is
in
fact
a
contest.
that
evidence
by
credible
witness
uncontroverted
was
introduced
and
is
in
the
appendix.
now,
here
was
the
situation.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
in
the
state
court?
the
state
court
sir
was
the
petition
for
a
recount
under
the
state
statute.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
it
was
a
contest
as
the
indiana
supreme
court
has
three
times
held
declaring
this
very
statute
to
be
unconstitutional,
before
it
was
amended
and
after
it
was
amended
wherein
the
argument
is
made
it
well.
after
the
amendment,
it
became
a
discovery
statute.
but
in
fact
in
bachelorette
(ph)
cited
by
the
our
court,
our
supreme
court,
the
indiana
supreme
court
said
“it
violates
article
4
section
10
of
the
constitution
of
indiana,
which
is
the
mirror
image
of
article
1
section
5
of
the
federal
constitution”.
so,
three
times,
our
highest
court
that
struck
down
this
statute
as
saying
that
it
could
not
apply
to
the
members
of
the
indiana
general
assembly.
now,
there
are
4,400
precincts
in
indiana.
they
petitioned
in
11
counties.
440
precincts
and
11
counties
are
4,000
plus
precincts.
in
one
of
the
counties
in
one
in
which
the
principal
case
came
up
into
the
federal
court,
came
over
in
the
federal
court,
it
was
fragmentary,
just
part
of
the
precincts.
now,
the
court
was
moving.
commissioners
were
been
appointed.
33
commissioners
were
being
appointed
in
33
different
state
jurisdictions.
as
shown
by
the
evidence
and
by
the
law
of
indiana,
the
appellant’s
party
control
every
precinct
in
indiana,
all
4,400
of
them.
by
that
i
mean,
the
judge
and
the
inspector
in
the
majority
party
which
was
appellants
control
every
precinct,
giving
them
the
opportunity
to
make
the
original
judgment
as
state
of
a
counsel
as
each
person
came
to
the
polling
place.
in
marian
county,
the
election
board
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
his
party
had
cast
a
highest
number
of
votes
at
the
previous
election
was
controlled
by
appellant’s
party.
the
canvassing
board
which
does
check
arithmetical
errors
was
controlled
by
appellant’s
party.
now,
in
that
atmosphere
and
i
must
be
candid
to
tell
you,
every
judge
in
indiana
at
this
time
was
also
selected
on
the
partisan
political
ballot.
right
along
with
the
county
treasurer
and
the
county
clerk,
and
our
supreme
court
and
appellate
court
judges
are
like
wise
selected.
so,
you
can
see
the
atmosphere
in
the
united
states
senate
raise
between
two
strong
political
parties.
now,
that
was
the
atmosphere,
and
the
recount
proceeded.
alright,
it
was
at
that
point
that
we
had
to
look
at
the
indiana
statute
on
recounts,
which
has
been
thrice
declared
to
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
article
4
section
10
of
the
indiana
constitution
which
says,
the
general
assembly
shall
be
the
judge
of
the
election
qualifications
and
returns
of
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
a
mirror
image
of
the
article
1
section
5
it
says,
“united
states
senate
will
be
the
judge
of
the
election
returns
of
the
qualifications
of
a
senator.”
alright!
mr.
john
j.
dillon
i
can
not
see
how
logically
it
could
prove,
otherwise,
there
is
no
decision
at
any
place
that
says
that
this
is
not
true
that
i
confine
that
if
you
get
in
to
the
the
judge
and
the
senator’s
race,
the
jurisdiction
is
in
the
senate.
now,
these
recount
commissions
were
proceeding
to
judge
the
senatorial
race.
that
is
the
thrust
of
this
law
suit.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
oh,
yes.
jurisdiction
was
predicated
on
1343
a,
and
article
1
section
5
of
the
constitution.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
well,
mr.
john
j.
dillon
that
question
was
never
raised
in
the
trial
court.
but
i
say
this,
we
are
here
now
as
the
appellees.
and
if
the
judgment
was
solid,
then
it
was
solid.
and
i
say
that
in
the
powell
versus
mccormick,
this
court
said
that
the
jurisdiction
under
the
1331
a,
the
general
jurisdiction
statute
is
valid.
so
if
that
be
true,
then
we
are
entitled
to
the
position
because
we
are
here
as
the
appellees,
and
we
got
the
article.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
2283?
i
will
get
to
it
and
you
want
me
to
reach
this
now?
mr.
john
j.
dillon
alright.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
yes
sir.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
yes
sir.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
we
do
not
consider
the
state
court
and
it
was
just
a
trial
court
which
i
will
get
to.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
no
i
suppose
--
there
was
a
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter,
i
would
so
concede.
nevertheless
it
was
not
argued.
i
mean
the
lack
of
the
pleading
position
was
not
argued
and
the
court
mentioned,
title
42
1983,
and
the
court
here
--
assume
that
we
are
correct,
that
we
all
would
agree,
if
we
could
agree
to
that
that
there
was
a
clear
violation
of
article
1
section
5.
then
1443(3)
says
if
the
law
provides,
we
can
go
into
district
court
and
get
relief.
alright.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
do
what
sir?
mr.
john
j.
dillon
that
is
the
supreme
court
of
indiana’s
position?
sir,
that
i
view
that
to
be
their
position.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
no
sir.
three
times,
they
have
said
and
the
last
time
being
that
in
the
case
of
a
member
of
the
indiana
legislature
that
this
statute
was
unconstitutional.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
yes
sir.
three
times
the
supreme
court
struck
down
the
very
statute.
now,
the
only
basis
that
they
consent
--
mr.
john
j.
dillon
sir?
mr.
john
j.
dillon
that
the
members
of
the
legislature
of
the
united
states
senate
or
congress.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
yes.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
yes.
because
dogcatcher
is
not
prescribed
by
article
1
section
5,
or
section
--
mr.
john
j.
dillon
not
the
governor.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
the
governor,
because
you
see,
when
they
amended
a
statute,
they
said
the
lieutenant
governor,
the
governor
and
members
of
the
general
assembly,
mr.
john
j.
dillon
yes,
you
could
permit.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
judges
are
elected
on
the
partisan
political
ballot.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
for
judge?
either
could
be.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
i
think
so.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
well,
i
say
that
the
court
was
justified.
there
is
no
logical
difference
between
the
rationality
of
the
indiana
court’s
deciding
that
a
member
of
a
legislature
cannot
be
contested
except
in
the
legislature
than
saying
a
member
of
the
united
states
senate
cannot
be
contested
anywhere
except
in
the
senate,
and
the
reasoning
in
the
cases
cited
in
batchelet,
beaman,
acker
in
the
indiana
cases
which
we
relied
upon
are
identical
with
the
reasonings
in
barry
versus
cunningham,
mr.
john
j.
dillon
that
is
true,
that
is
true.
well,
i
know
legal
historical
precedent
where
that
is
true
your
honor.
in
each
case,
there
is
no
precedent
that
says
it
was
a
matter
of
contest,
it
does
not
belong
in
the
legislative
body.
be
it
the
state
assembly
or
be
it
the
national
congress.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
precisely,
your
honor.
precisely,
and
i
say
that
our
evidence
shows
--
mr.
john
j.
dillon
that
there
is
a
contest
and
the
supreme
court
of
indiana,
three
times
said
it
was
unconstitutional.
that
is
the
only
basis
it
will
be
unconstitutional.
it
attempted
the
judge
derive
a
member
of
the
indiana
general
assembly
under
article
4
section
10
of
the
indiana
constitution
which
is
identical
to
article
1
section
5
of
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
if
the
statute
provided
for
a
simply
arithmetical
determination
as
a
canvassing
board
did
in
this
case
and
incidentally
did
make
some
mathematical
changes
in
the
very
county
in
question
and
forwarded
those,
that
is
one
thing.
but
the
evidence
was
and
the
fact
is
that
they
perceived
to
get
into
the
paper
ballots.
and
they
perceived
to
make
judgments
again
on
how
the
precinct
people
counted
these
ballots.
and
the
undisputed
evidence
was
and
the
fact
is
and
even
in
our
court’s
decisions
they
even
have
printed
where
the
supreme
court
judges
have
said
will
add
access
too
far
and
that
check
is
wrong.
so,
that
is
where
we
get
into
the
judgment
quality
of
the
statute.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
but
our
statute
does
not
so
provide.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
they
should.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
yes
sir.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
that
by
all
--
mr.
john
j.
dillon
yes
sir.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
yes.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
they
have
a
count
here.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
and
they
had
a
certificate
presented
by
the
secretary
of
state
to
the
governor,
and
by
the
governor,
the
senator
hartke
and
presented
by
senator
hartke
to
the
united
states
senate,
they
have
a
count.
now,
to
go
behind
that
count,
if
the
statute
provided
for
a
pure
arithmetical
recounting,
that
is
one
thing.
but
the
evidence
here
was
and
the
fact
was
and
our
indiana
supreme
court
has
three
times
found
that
it
is
a
contest
when
get
into
the
judging
the
validity
of
these
ballots
for
--
member
of
the
general
assembly
or
the
united
states
senate
or
congress.
i
think
that
logically
follows
because
those
precedents
were
footed
and
founded
upon
the
same
principles.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
that
does.
it
does.
that
comes
under
article
1
section
4.
you
got
to
start
some
place.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
it
is.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
it
does,
those
three
people,
appointed
by
congressman
or
other
political
party
did
do
that.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
they
can
not
judge
the
ballots,
they
can
recount
the
ballots.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
they
did.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
because
that
is
not
a
continuation
of
the
election
process
under
article
1
section
4.
that
becomes
--
mr.
john
j.
dillon
yes,
provided
only
--
mr.
john
j.
dillon
ah,
that
is
the
counting
and
the
first
time
counting.
the
second
time,
argument
on
a
laxalt
candidate
and
the
wickersham
case
and
if
that
is
all
they
did
was
count
them,
fine.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
quite
to
the
contrary.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
quite
to
the
contrary,
as
the
evidence
showed,
they
are
making
a
judgment
on
what
was
done
at
the
precinct
polling
place
and
as
the
evidence
showed,
there
was
no
way
to
unscramble
that,
and
that
is
wherein
the
irreparable
harm
was.
they
could
never
get
to
the
senate
and
determine
how
that
judgment
was
made
by
the
recount
commission
if
that
evidence
was
not
maintained
until
it
went
to
the
united
states
senate.
and
interestingly
enough,
a
year
has
passed
over
and
no
petition
has
even
been
presented
to
the
united
states
senate
by
the
appellant
here
in,
asking
for
a
contest
of
this
election.
now,
it
is
of
course,
argument
on
article
1
section
4,
article
1
section
5,
but
our
evidence
showed
that
this
violated
article
1
section
5.
it
got
into
the
prerogatives
of
the
senate.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
because
the
evidence
would
be
irreparably
commingled
and
it
would
be
impossible
for
the
senate
to
determine
how
the
recount
commission
viewed
what
the
precinct
commission
did.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
the
senate
has
no
specific
rules
on
it.
they
proceed
ad
hoc
on
these
matters
but
that
is
the
custom.
yes.
let
me
say
this.
it
has
been
done
in
senatorial
recount
or
contest
cases.
but
that
was
part
of
our
equity
that
we
felt
like
we
were
entitled
to
and
three-judge
court
so
ruled
that
once
these
recount
commissioner
started
re-judging,
and
said
oh,
no,
the
evidence
all
carefully
lays
out
exactly
how
this
was
done
and
how
that
they
got
into
these
paper
ballots,
which
went
all
the
precincts.
some
paper
ballots
and
the
all
the
precincts.
now,
the
machine,
you
see
is
no
problem,
and
the
machines
make
arithmetical
count.
but
on
the
paper
ballots
when
they
come
in
from
the
precincts,
that
is
a
far
different
thing.
some
are
in
the
counted
bags
as
the
evidence
shows.
some
are
rejected
bags.
now,
these
commissioners
proceed
to
the
redo
that.
one
of
the
counties,
even
though
the
states
statute
requires
the
whole
counting
to
be
machine,
wayne
county
as
the
evidence
showed
was
all
on
paper
ballots.
so,
here
we
have
all
of
these
commissions,
11
different
commission
proceeding
to
make
judgments
on
these
ballots
which
were
passed,
and
the
court
found
are
the
evidence
that
that
belonged
in
the
united
states
senate.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
well,
i
have
found
that
in
every
case
where
it
violated
article
1
section
5,
they
have
said
that
they
could
not
permit
it
to
go
forward.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
well,
in
laxalt
versus
canon,
they
said
that
they
granted
the
relief
there
and
then
went
on
and
there
was
recount
before
the
contest
you
see.
there
was
no
question
raised
about
the
recount
and
laxalt
versus
canon
went
on
to
say
that
the
senate
is
the
judge
under
article
1
section
5.
so
presumably
in
laxalt
versus
canon,
if
there
had
been
--
if
in
fact,
their
recount
was
a
kind
of
a
recount
we
have,
and
that
is
what
is
the
essence
of
this
law
suit,
what
this
recount
constitutes,
and
we
say
it
constitutes
a
contest
and
our
supreme
court
of
indiana
three
times
said
the
same
thing
as
we
see
it.
we
can
not
see
how
there
is
any
cavil
in
that
argument.
but
nevertheless
it
has
been
raised
and
we
are
trying
to
meet
it.
now,
we
went
into
federal
court
and
made
a
federal
constitutional
claim,
a
federal
constitutional
claim.
article
1
section
5
of
the
constitution.
there
was
no
underlying
state
question
involved
because
if
the
state
--
law
question
was
clear
as
we
see
it,
three
times
the
supreme
court
had
said
that
it
was
not
a
viable
statute
so
far
as
the
state
legislature
was
concerned.
now,
we
think
it
is
only
reasonable
if
that
be
true
and
now
with
the
underlying
constitutional
basis,
that
that
certainly
is
true,
the
office
of
the
united
states
senate.
now,
motions
were
filed
under
2283
in
the
federal
court.
we
met
those
and
we
meet
them
now
in
theory
that
this
is
not
the
type
of
proceedings
that
2283
prohibits
granting
an
injunction
against.
these
commissioners
--
this
is
not
court
litigation
because
there
is
no
appeal
in
indiana
from
a
recount.
there
is
no
appeal.
you
can
not
do
anything
and
yet
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
j.
dillon
writ
of
prohibition.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
the
state
court
remedy
used
in
the
batchelet
--
mr.
john
j.
dillon
alright,
i
will
explain
this.
first
of
all,
why
do
we
go
writ
of
prohibition?
all
through
the
brief,
i
indicate
that
writ
of
prohibition
is
the
simple
remedy.
well,
that
depends
on
what
the
factual
situation
is
and
how
fast
things
are
moving.
now,
indiana
writ
of
prohibition
or
the
rules
of
our
procedure
requires
that
--
first
of
all,
if
an
emergency
writ
is
not
granted
and
it
is
very
difficult
to
get
emergency
writ,
then
the
petition
for
the
temporary
writ
of
prohibition
and
alternative
writ
of
mandate
must
lay
over
seven
days.
and,
that
the
only
hearing
would
be
2
o’clock
on
monday.
alright,
now
if
you
file
on
tuesday
and
you
do
not
get
a
hearing
on
you
temporary
emergency,
then
you
could
be
put
off
13
days.
now
this
two
courts
had
overruled
us.
our
motion
dismissed
on
the
ground
they
where
violating
article
1
section
5
with
the
federal
constitution,
not
the
state
constitution.
so,
we
went
to
federal
court
to
get
a
restraining
order
to
stop
it,
to
hold
it
and
see
whether
we
were
right
--
mr.
john
j.
dillon
yes.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
sir?
mr.
john
j.
dillon
if
the
court
ruled,
as
we
can
get
the
court
to
hear
it.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
change
the
law.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
yes.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
for
two
reasons.
we
thought
that
under
the
fact
situation,
it
was
our
judgment
that
writ
of
prohibition
was
not
an
expeditious
remedy
but
more
importantly
before
this
court,
we
do
not
think
we
had
exhausted
this
straight
remedy
where
we
could
go
into
the
federal
court
or
federal
question
without
an
underlying
state
question.
we
did
not
see
any
question
of
abstention
or
comity
involved
in
this.
so,
we
went
to
federal
court.
we
got
a
restraining
order
and
then
we
got
a
temporary
injunction
after
a
full
scale
hearing
where
evidence
was
had.
now,
the
question
said
was
there
any
indiana
precedents
and
say
that
this
is
a
ministerial
proceedings?
and
the
answer
to
that
is
yes.
there
are
two
precedents
cited
in
our
brief.
watson
versus
biggs
(ph)
and
state
ex
rel
mccormick.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
both.
they
are
intermixed
but
they
say
that
they
are
not
the
part
of
animal
that
we
say,
we
are
talking
about
in
a
2283
prohibition
against
that
grant
them
injunction.
and,
we
cite
many
authorities
and
there
is
court
deposition
that
these
were
not
proceedings
in
the
state
court
which
were
specifically
prohibited
under
younger.
certainly,
they
are
criminal
prosecutions
and
watson
versus
pig
and
the
state
ex
rel
mccormick,
one
was
a
prosecutor
and
one
was
a
county
auditor,
and
they
described
these
people
as
a
ministerial
and
i
believe
counsel
in
appellant's
brief
concedes
or
at
least
argues
the
same
way
that
these
are
ministerial
proceedings,
not
judicial
proceedings,
or
that
they
are
not
judicial
proceedings.
now,
the
next
question
is
of
course,
does
john
reply?
we
say
no.
we
say
it
does
not
apply
for
a
reason
that
these
are
not
state
court
proceedings
under
2283.
and,
i
would
like
to
also
cite
the
case
of
hobbs
versus
thompson
which
was
previously
cited
because
again,
it
was
not
exactly
a
2283
case
but
it
does
give
an
excellent
review
of
what
the
younger
decisions
made
were
called
at
this
february
sac
state
decisions
in
younger.
and,
judge
goldberg
in
that
case
which
has
been
previously
cited
here
gives
his
view,
a
very
rational
view
of
the
application
of
2283.
now,
after
this
case
was
tried
and
here
in
comes
a
--
mr.
john
j.
dillon
15
minutes
as
per
my
computation.
at
anyway,
prior
to
the
taking
--
first
of
all,
the
issue
the
(inaudible)
issue,
hartke
presented
himself
on
january
21
he
was
seated.
the
senator
curtis
motion
said
that
he
would
be
seated
with
unanimous
consent
without
prejudice
to
this
appeal
pending
in
the
supreme
court
and
recognizing
that
this
supreme
court
might
order
a
recount,
to
that
effect.
now,
i
suggest
you
to
that
language
is
completely
nugatory.
it
means
nothing.
senator
hartke
is
seated
just
like
every
other
senator.
he
seated
savvy
to
article
1
section
5
of
the
constitution.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
that
is
my
next
point.
we
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss,
and
we
cited
barry
versus
cunningham.
now,
it
is
1929
case
involving
senator
beyer.
but
the
fact
is
as
far
as
i
can
see,
that
case
is
not
been
in
anyway
trampled
upon
any
of
these
decisions.
and
every
decision
underlying
the
state
court,
be
they
federal
or
be
they
state
court
or
be
they
state
legislature
or
be
they
federal
legislature,
when
the
senator
or
the
assembly
men
seats
himself
and
is
seated,
then,
then
this
thing
moves
into
that
body.
and,
that
is
what
senator
beyer
said,
that
is
what
the
barry
versus
cunningham
involving
senator
beyer
said.
he
was
seated,
and
this
matter
is
now
for
the
united
states
senate
to
determine.
i
can
not
see
what
can
be
done
at
this
point.
except,
let
this
matter
go
to
the
united
states
senate.
now,
there
is
quarrel
because
we
went
to
federal
district
court
to
press
a
federal
claim,
a
federal
constitutional
claim
under
article
1
section
5.
i
raised
the
question,
why
does
not
the
appellant
go
after
year
to
the
united
states
senate
where
he
could
get
all
the
relief
that
he
could
ask
for
if
he
convinced
the
senate
that
he
is
correct
in
his
position.
so,
there
is
not
really
that
this
case
is
not
moot.
it
was
not
a
case
when
we
tried
it
in
the
federal
district
court,
but
once
he
became
seated
at
the
united
states
senate
under
the
rule
of
barry
versus
cunningham,
this
case
is
moot.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
what
could
he
do
now?
mr.
john
j.
dillon
oh,
i
take
a
petition
to
senate
and
ask
for
a
recount.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
i
think
they
could,
yes
sir.
i
think
you
see,
mr.
john
j.
dillon
article
1
section
5?
yes
sir.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
you
mean
if
they
--
mr.
john
j.
dillon
well,
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
expulsion,
i
think
it
would
be
a
majority
vote
situation,
where
they
found
that
he
was
not
elected,
that
is
the
normal
procedure.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
yes
sir.
he
has
been
seated,
january
21
of
--
mr.
john
j.
dillon
that
of
course
is
our
position
and
we
filed
a
motion
--
mr.
john
j.
dillon
well,
i
do
not
know
what
the
senate
can
do
because
they
adopt
different
rules
on
these
cases
as
they
go
along.
you
see
and
i
hate
to
say
it
--
mr.
john
j.
dillon
but
i
know
that
he
had
been
seated?
mr.
john
j.
dillon
yes
sir,
and
of
course,
we
will
raise
a
doctrine
of
laches,
if
we
get
to
the
senate
a
year
later
because
the
fact
is,
these
machines
have
been
cleared
and
pictures
have
been
taken
--
but
that
is
not
before
this
court.
but,
the
jurisdictional
question
under
article
1
section
5,
is
certainly
here.
he
has
been
seated,
just
like
every
other
senator
and
this
language
in
the
senator
curtis
motion
has
no
constitutional
effect.
mr.
john
j.
dillon
i
would
hope
so
your
honor.
that
would
be
a
new
departure
in
some
regard,
i
suppose.
but
seriously,
i
do
not
think
it
means
a
thing
constitutionally.
i
think
he
seats
there
just
every
other
senator
subject
to
be
in
crude
that
he
was
not
elected
and
the
place
that
you
prude
that
in
the
united
state
senate.
now,
that
is
the
ruling
precedent
at
this
court
in
barry
versus
cunningham.
and,
the
remarkable
thing
even
the
late
cases
be
the
laxalt
or
be
there
wickersham,
when
they
get
in
this
--
mr.
john
j.
dillon
alright.
but
they
all
fall
back
deceited.
the
constitutional
provision
in
every
state
is
very
nearly
identical
to
the
federal
constitution
provision
article
1
section
5.
and,
they
all
fall
back
to
the
same
argument.
well,
the
legislative
body
is
the
judge
of
the
election,
returns
and
qualifications
of
the
member.
now,
we
are
talking
about
the
election
returns
and
qualifications
of
the
united
states
senator,
why
should
they
not
be
presented
to
the
united
state
senate?
why
should
it
not
be
presented
there
in
the
first
instance?
we
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
this
court,
the
court
deferred
the
jurisdictional
question
till
the
day
as
i
understand
it,
and
i
want
to
press
strongly
to
the
point
that
he
is
seated
in
under
barry
versus
cunningham
that
i
believe
that
in
(inaudible)
this
case,
i
think
it
is
moot.
i
do
not
think
anything
could
be
done.
the
state
recounts
as
in
the
various
--
there
are
all
kinds
of
different
cases
on
them.
some
say
they
are
valid
and
some
say
they
are
not,
and
you
have
to
look
at
the
various
state
laws
to
determine
whether
they
would
be
valid
measures
in
article
1
section
5.
but
look
at
our
recount
statute
and
what
laxalt
v.
cannon
says
about
nevada’s
case
and
what
wickersham
says
about
the
case
in
that
state
or
the
minnesota
case.
we
know
what
the
indiana
courts
upheld.
they
have
held
the
statute
unconstitutional,
that
it
violates
article
1
section
5.
now,
the
trial
court
did
mention
as
i
said
title
421983
of
the
civil
rights
act.
we
trouble
ourselves
with
this
question.
how
do
you
go
in?
assuming
we
are
right
that
out
here
is
a
body,
a
ministerial
body
actually
violating
the
senate’s
prerogatives
article
1
section
5
which
we
thought
we
proved
and
the
court
thought
we
proved
and
the
evidence
shows
it.
we
meticulously
put
the
evidence
in.
so,
we
would
not
get
up
here
and
say
well,
it
is
a
facial
argument.
on
its
face
they
say
recount.
so
if
on
its
face
it
says
recount,
if
you
can
count
them
once,
you
can
count
them
twice
argument.
so,
we
said
we
got
to
prove
that
you
do
not
do
that,
and
we
did
prove
it
and
the
court
so
found
that
this
is
a
contest.
that
moves
it
in
to
article
1
section
5,
that
moves
it
in
to
the
senate.
the
important
thing,
i
think
that
there
is
no
question
that
the
fact
shows
that
the
congressman,
appellant
hartke
and
appellant
roudebush
had
controlled
the
polling
places
as
party.
had
control
of
the
recount
commission,
had
control
of
the
canvassing
board.
now
they
wanted
to
get
into
a
further
contest.
they
wanted
to
go
in
to
11
separate
counties,
isolated
precincts
at
some
case
and
rehash
those
judges.
the
court
found
properly
as
the
indiana
supreme
court
had
found
three
times
that
that
violated
article
1
section
5.
we
do
not
think
it
is
a
question
of
exhaustion
of
state
remedies.
we
do
not
think
the
writ
of
prohibition
was
necessary,
we
think
we
can
go
the
federal
court
and
press
a
federal
claim
where
there
is
no
uncertainty
in
the
state
law.
and,
we
did
so.
thank
you
your
honors.
