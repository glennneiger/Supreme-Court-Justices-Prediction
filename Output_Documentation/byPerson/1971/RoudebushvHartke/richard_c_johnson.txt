mr.
richard
c.
johnson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
i
please
the
court.
my
task
is
a
doubly
difficult
one
because
much
of
the
ground
that
i
was
going
to
try
it
or
plough
has
been
taken
by
the
previous
case.
in
fact,
a
better
argument
was
presented
at
that
time
than
perhaps
i
can
present
right
now.
i
would
like
to
advance
two
points
to
the
court
which
in
the
opinion
of
the
appellant’s
requires
a
reversal.
first
is
that
the
provisions
of
2283
are
applicable
to
this
case.
as
the
court
knows,
this
act
is
written
in
plain
and
clear
language
and
provides
that
no
injunction
shall
issue
to
stay
any
state
court
proceeding.
the
act
with
minor
changes
as
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out
in
previous
case
date
back
to
1793.
there
are
only
three
--
mr.
richard
c.
johnson
that
is
an
issue,
mr.
justice
brennan
and
the
appellant
claims
that
since
a
state
court
proceeding
namely
recount
is
administerial
in
a
non
adversary
proceeding
that
is
it
not
a
state
court
proceeding
within
the
meaning
of
2283.
mr.
richard
c.
johnson
yes.
that
is
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
richard
c.
johnson
these
officers
are
officers
of
the
court.
they
have
to
be
appointed
by
the
court.
the
court
is
under
a
duty
by
statute
to
preserve
the
integrity
of
the
ballots,
and
as
far
as
a
non-adversary
proceeding
is
concerned,
the
appellee
himself
filed
two
preliminary
motions
and
two
different
proceeding.
motions
to
dismiss,
both
of
those
motions
were
ruled
adversely
to
the
appellee
and
he
chose
to
fight
his
fight
in
the
forum
of
the
federal
district
court.
mr.
richard
c.
johnson
i
would
say
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
i
would
also
add
that
the
appellee
and
the
lower
court
in
my
opinion
failed
to
distinguished
between
the
election
contest
and
a
recount
procedure.
the
indiana
law
provides
for
both
types
of
proceedings.
in
election
contest
the
distinction
is
this
that
in
a
election
contest,
it
is
an
adversary
proceeding
and
no
recount
commission
as
such
is
appointed.
however
in
a
recount,
of
course,
theory
is
a
retabulation
of
the
vote
after
the
commissioners
of
the
recount
commission
have
been
appointed
by
the
court.
mr.
richard
c.
johnson
not
to
my
knowledge,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
richard
c.
johnson
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
richard
c.
johnson
if
there
is
a
parallel,
i
am
not
aware
of
it.
but
i
will
say
this.
the
parallel
was
probably
this,
that
the
commissioners,
if
there
is
one,
that
the
commissioners
do
report
to
the
court.
the
court
has
jurisdiction
of
all
times
over
the
activity
of
the
commissioners
and
the
court
is
under
a
duty
as
i
as
said
before
to
preserve
the
integrity
of
the
ballots.
mr.
richard
c.
johnson
my
understanding
is
the
court
could
remove
one
or
could
remove
the
entire
commission
at
any
time
during
the
procedure.
if
in
the
court’s
opinion,
the
commission
did
not
follow
the
mandate
of
the
statute
itself.
mr.
richard
c.
johnson
yes,
the
court
could
make
that
determination
and
in
fact
the
court
is
under
a
mandatory
duty
by
the
statute
to
make
such
a
determination.
appellee
argues
at
one
point
and
the
lower
court
reasoned
that
this
was
a
case
analogous
to
a
civil
rights
case
and
dependant
on
a
case,
baines
which
has
been
alluded
to
before
in
the
prior
case,
baines
against
the
city
of
danville
for
its
authority
to
issue
the
injunction.
the
baines
case
was
a
true
civil
rights
case.
this
action
does
not
involve
any
first
amendment
right,
the
violation
of
any
first
amendment
right.
there
is
no
penal
prosecution
under
a
states
statute
which
is
invalid
on
its
face.
no
prosecution
conducted
in
bad
faith
or
for
the
purpose
of
harassment.
it
does
not
involve
a
statute
as
i
say
which
was
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
the
second
point
that
i
would
like
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention
is
the
constitutionality
of
the
indiana
recount
statute.
mr.
richard
c.
johnson
yes.
and
it
is
up
to
this
court
to
see
if
this
particular
case
fits
a
category?
mr.
richard
c.
johnson
yes,
in
the
court
did
hear
one
witness,
that
first
of
all
issued
a
temporary
restraining
order
without
notice
to
the
party.
and
then
the
court
heard
one
witness
in
an
evidentiary
hearing,
read
the
experience
of
one
recount
at
a
prior
time,
that
the
member
of
the
recount
commission
duly
appointed
by
the
court.
the
lower
court
further
reasoned
that
the
indiana
recount
statute
is
unconstitutional
and
in
violation
of
article
1
section
5
of
the
united
states
constitution
which
provides
very
briefly
that
the
senate
is
the
body
which
determines
the
election
and
qualifications
of
its
members.
article
1,
section
4
imposes
a
duty
on
states
to
prescribe
the
places,
time,
and
manner
of
holding
the
elections
for
senators
and
representatives.
it
is
our
contention
that
the
indiana
recount
statute
is
more
analogous
to
the
counting
of
vote
than
it
is
to
an
election
contest.
the
recount
statute
although
the
recount
commission
is
appointed
by
the
court
and
so
forth,
the
recount
commission
simply
retabulates
the
vote.
this
of
course,
under
the
supervision
of
the
court.
the
lower
court
relied
on
three
decisions
of
the
indiana
supreme
court.
i
think
it
is
significant
to
realize
that
from
the
record,
the
appellee
chose
not
to
take
his
case
through
the
state
court
procedure
but
chose
instead
to
go
directly
to
the
federal
court
after
having
lost
his
case
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
in
the
lower
court.
two
of
these
three
decisions
which
are
relied
on
by
the
appellee
were
decided
prior
to
the
1961
amendment
of
the
indiana
recount
statute.
the
amendment
provided
that
recount
would
be
use
for
informational
purposes
and
would
not
supersede
any
previously
issued
certificates
of
election.
logically,
the
amendment
would
apply
to
races
to
the
us
senate.
since
the
indiana
and
federal
constitutions
have
primarily
identical
provision.
in
addition,
it
is
the
appellant’s
case
that
a
recount
stands
on
the
same
footing
as
the
original
count,
that
a
recount
is
merely
a
retabulation
of
the
vote.
the
appellee
will
counter
that
argument
by
saying
that,
“well,
judgment
is
exercised
by
a
recount
commission”.
i
would
answer
that
by
saying
“the
judgment
is
exercised
when
the
vote
is
tabulated
initially”,
that
is
which
axis
is
within
the
circle,
which
is
without.
if
the
vote
has
been
cast
by
a
machine,
whether
it
has
been
counted
or
not.
the
supreme
courts
of
the
states
of
minnesota,
georgia,
and
oklahoma
have
held
that
a
recount
procedure
does
not
violate
the
provisions
of
article
1
section
5
of
the
us
constitution.
providing
the
procedure
is
the
intrical
part
of
the
election
code
of
the
state.
this
is
the
fact
in
the
state
of
indiana.
the
reasons
for
having
a
recount
procedure
are
compelling.
in
indiana
as
in
many
states,
polls
are
open
from
6
am
until
6
pm.
members
of
the
precinct
election
boards
have
had
a
long
day
by
the
time
the
polls
close.
however
afterward,
they
must
count
the
votes
and
certify
the
results
to
the
counting
board.
the
members
of
the
precinct
election
boards
in
many
cases
are
housewives,
anxious
to
get
home
to
the
family.
what
i
am
trying
to
bring
to
the
court’s
attention
is
simply
that
the
chance
of
error
in
the
initial
tabulation
increases.
there
is
a
direct
relationship
between
the
chance
of
error
and
the
physical
well
being
of
the
precinct
election
board.
therefore,
it
is
incumbent
to
have
some
sort
of
recount
procedure.
in
view
of
the
safeguards
present
in
the
statute
and
the
fact
that
the
procedure
is
and
has
been
an
intrical
part
of
indiana
election
code
since
1945,
the
appellant
respectfully
submits
that
there
is
no
conflict
with
article
1
section
5
of
the
us
constitution.
i
will
sit
down
if
the
court
has
no
questions.
thank
you.

it
is
incumbent
to
have
some
sort
of
recount
procedure.
in
view
of
the
safeguards
present
in
the
statute
and
the
fact
that
the
procedure
is
and
has
been
an
intrical
part
of
indiana
election
code
since
1945,
the
appellant
respectfully
submits
that
there
is
no
conflict
with
article
1
section
5
of
the
us
constitution.
i
will
sit
down
if
the
court
has
no
questions.
thank
you.
