we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
number
66,
roudebush
against
hartke
and
67.
sendak
against
hartke.
mr.
schabel,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
johnson?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
are
the
commissioners
appointed
much
like
special
masters
are
appointed
by
a
court
historically?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
indiana
statute
provides
for
the
appointment
of
these
officers?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
the
appointment
of
these
commissioners
are
special
officers
as
an
alternative
to
having
the
state
court
judges
sit
down
and
count
a
million
and
half
votes
themselves,
is
that
correct
or?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
not
it
up
to
the
three-judge
court
to
look
into
that
and
see
whether
that
was
sham
breathing
of
whether
it
had
a
basis?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
johnson.
mr.
dillon?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you
are
speaking
of
litigation
now
in
the
state
court
in
order
in
the
federal
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
what
was
the
relief
asked
before
in
the
state
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
say
in
fact
it
was
more
than
a
recount?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
feel
that
is
binding
on
the
federal
determination
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
upon
your
hesitating
here
for
a
minute,
let
me
ask
you
about
this
jurisdictional
point.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
in
fact
there
was
no
jurisdiction
in
the
three-
judge
district
court.
i
assume
you
mean
when
you
refer
to
trial
court,
you
are
talking
about
three-
judge
district
court.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
fact
there
was
none.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
if
in
fact
there
was
jurisdictional
infirmity,
does
it
make
any
difference
for
there
anyone
raised
it
at
anytime?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
dillon
tell
me
once
again
why
is
indiana
decision
based
on
indiana
constitutional
provisions
is
binding
for
federal
constitutional
purposes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
what
if
the
report
of
the
commissioners
here
was
simply
to
say
they
have
canvassed
all
of
the
ballots
and
that
the
true
and
correct
count
is
as
follows
and
said
nothing
else?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
after
contests
or
recounts
or
whatever
name
you
give
them
are
held,
they
always
come
either
to
the
house
of
the
senate
and
the
house
of
the
senate
as
the
case
maybe
exercises
a
new
and
original
and
independent
judgment,
do
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
already
argued,
you
have
already
argued
that
the
senate
is
the
final
judge?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
therefore,
the
senate
and
the
house
is
the
matter
of
fact
have
never
accepted
state
findings
on
this,
have
they?
as
final
and
finding?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
come
before
a
subcommittee
and
they
have
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
hearing
and
if
there
is
a
dispute
over
ballots
or
dispute
over
the
count?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
senator
of
the
house
makes
the
final
decision?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but,
can
they
do
that
if
they
have
not
got
a
count?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
does
it
take
anything
away
from
the
senate
as
long
as
the
senate
has
the
final
word
on
the
recount?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
is
not
the
custom
to
certify
the
ballots
and
actually
deliver
them
physically
to
the
senator
of
the
house
including
in
a
separate,
impounded
group
all
those
which
are
contested
or
questioned
or
challenged?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
the
federal
court
ever
enjoined
the
state’s
recount
before
and
case
that
you
know
of?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
they
cited
in
the
brief,
i
didn't
identify
those
cases?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
excuse
me.
we
will
finish
today.
we
will
finish
today
and
you
have
some
time
left
yet.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then,
we
should
not
really
be
here
today?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
the
senate
in
putting
that
language
in
just
being
polite
to
the
supreme
court?
was
that
the
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
you
have
three
minutes
remaining
counsel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
