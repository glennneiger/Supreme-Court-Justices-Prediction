unknown
speaker
you
say
jurisdiction
on
a
federal
case
was
predicated
upon
that
section
1343(3)?
unknown
speaker
but
that
just
a
jurisdictional
statute,
what
was
the
substantive
provision?
unknown
speaker
because
1343(3)
simply
says
that
the
district
courts
have
jurisdiction
of
any
civil
action
authorized
by
law
to
be
commence
by
any
person.
unknown
speaker
that
normally
you
site
the
law
on
which
you
rely.
unknown
speaker
you
do
indeed
but
did
this
plaintiff?
unknown
speaker
what
did
he
rely
on?
what
federal
substantive
law?
unknown
speaker
maybe
you
are
not
the
person
to
ask?
unknown
speaker
you
are
defendant,
are
not
you?
unknown
speaker
have
not
there
mr.
schabel
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
our
history,
many,
many
recounts
in
senatorial
elections?
unknown
speaker
there
was
one
between
the
contest
between
senator
morris
and
senator
buchwald
(ph)?
unknown
speaker
how
about?
unknown
speaker
senator
tydings
and
senator
--
the
man
who
beat
him
in
the
--
unknown
speaker
senator
tydings
is
the
senior?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
was
i
asking
of
course
about
the
recounts
conducted
under
state
law?
unknown
speaker
this
thing
resonates
the
provision
of
privileges
and
immunities?
unknown
speaker
that
is
violating
of
the
indiana
--
unknown
speaker
of
course,
you
have
the
merits
now
--
did
you
get
to
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
need
any
--
unknown
speaker
any
statute
from
any
other
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
how
about
2283?
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
you
pick
it
now.
unknown
speaker
and
mayor
and
governor
and
--
unknown
speaker
not
the
governor.
unknown
speaker
how
about
(voice
overlap)
unknown
speaker
you
could
permit.
judges
are
elected
on
this?
unknown
speaker
even
if
they
recount
that
--
unknown
speaker
could
be?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
rational
difference
might
be
that
you
might
disagree
with
the
indiana
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
something
might
depend
upon
whether
or
not
this
is
classified
as
a
recount
or
a
contest?
unknown
speaker
that
it
is
that
is
not
a
--
unknown
speaker
well
county
is
the
first
place
that
requires
judging
ballots?
unknown
speaker
now,
you
have
to
start
and
the
state
i
take
it
is
in
authorized
to
count
the
ballots.
unknown
speaker
for,
instance,
and
then
that
in
those
instances,
it
judges
ballots,
will
it
be
invalid?
unknown
speaker
so,
if
the
state
says
that
this
counting
procedure
is
not
over
yet,
we
have
some
procedures
to
go
through
yet.
why
is
it
not
authorized
to
do
that
even
if
it
involves
doing
what
is
already
done,
judge
some
ballots?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
but
in
the
first
place,
they
counted
them
and
judged
the
ballots?
unknown
speaker
now,
why
can
not
they
do
it
over?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
said
they
can
count
them
over?
unknown
speaker
and
you
do
not
think
you
can
do
the
same
thing,
counting
them
again
that
you
did
not
counting
them
in
the
first
place?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
are
not
doing
anymore
of
the
second
go
around
than
they
did
on
the
first?
unknown
speaker
well
on
the
first
go
around,
they
had
to
judge
the
ballot.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
do
they
say
ministerial
or
non
judicial?
which
term
they
use?
unknown
speaker
what
could
the
senate
do
now?
unknown
speaker
now
that
you
conceded,
what
could
the
senate
do
now?
unknown
speaker
now?
after
the
senator
is
seated?
unknown
speaker
how
did
that
end
up
under
article
1
section
5
expelling
that
they
founded
it?
unknown
speaker
and
that,
we
expose
them?
unknown
speaker
if
they
found
against
it?
unknown
speaker
and,
he
is
already
been
seated
as
there
for
years?
unknown
speaker
(laughs)
as
far
as
you
come
out,
you
can
been
conceited,
at
the
end
of
it
both
from
the
senate
and
in
the
courts?
unknown
speaker
you
--
since
he
has
been
seated,
they
could
not
now
undertake
a
recount
in
the
senate?
unknown
speaker
well,
my
brother
stewart
said
you
do
not
have
to
answer
that.
you
are
here
in
the
court,
all
you
need
is
to
convince
the
court
that
yes
they
have
been
seated.
unknown
speaker
when
you
get
to
the
senate,
then
you
can
make
that
argument
over
there.
unknown
speaker
no,
because
it
is
a
state
