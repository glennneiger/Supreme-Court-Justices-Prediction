mr.
donald
a.
schabel
may
i
please
the
court.
these
cases
are
here
on
direct
appeal
from
an
interlocutory
injunction
granted
by
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
indiana,
sitting
as
three-judge
court.
that
court
by
a
2:1
decision
held
article
27
of
the
indiana
election
code,
insofar
as
it
establishes
a
procedure
for
a
recount
of
the
votes
cast
for
the
office
of
united
states
senator
to
be
unconstitutional.
further
consideration,
the
question
of
this
court's
jurisdiction
has
been
postponed
to
the
hearing
of
the
cases
on
the
merits.
the
issues
presented
by
the
two
appeals
are
the
same.
in
addition
to
the
jurisdictional
issue,
the
questions
presented
are
as
follows:
without
regard
to
the
applicability
of
the
anti-injunction
statute
or
to
the
alleged
unconstitutionality
of
the
election
code,
first
substantive
question
presented
is
whether
the
interlocutory
injunction
was
proper
under
established
principles
of
equity
jurisprudence?
the
second
question
is
whether
the
interlocutory
injunction
appealed
from
is
prohibited
by
the
language
of
the
anti-injunction
statute.
the
third
question
presented
is
whether
article
27
of
the
indiana
election
code
insofar
as
it
establishes
a
procedure
for
a
recount
of
the
votes
cast
for
the
office
of
united
states
senator
conflicts
with
article
1,
section
5
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
which
makes
a
senate
the
judge
of
the
elections
returns
in
qualifications
of
its
members.
now,
i
am
dividing
the
time
of
the
appellants
with
mr.
richard
johnson,
so
i
shall
discuss
the
jurisdictional
issue
in
the
first
of
the
questions
i
have
stated.
mr.
johnson
will
discuss
the
second
and
third
questions.
before
addressing
myself
to
the
question
of
jurisdiction,
i
shall
first
state
the
relevant
facts.
appellant
roudebush
and
appellee
hartke
were
candidates
for
the
office
of
the
united
states
senator
at
the
january
election
held
in
the
state
of
indiana
on
november
3,
1970.
the
canvass
of
the
return
show
that
hartke
had
the
greater
number
of
votes
by
a
margin
of
4,383
votes
out
of
a
1,737,797
votes.
the
indiana
election
code
provides
that
any
candidate
for
any
office
voted
upon
in
any
election
held
in
the
state
of
indiana
including
specifically
the
office
of
the
united
states
senator
has
a
right
to
petition
for
a
recount
of
the
votes
cast
in
any
voting
precinct,
any
or
all
voting
precincts
of
the
state.
provided
he
petitions
in
the
appropriate
courts
within
15
days
after
the
election.
pursuant
to
this,
appellant
roudebush
filed
petitions
for
recount
on
november
17,
1970
in
certain
selected
precincts
in
11
indiana
counties.
two
days
later,
appellee
hartke
appeared
in
all
11
proceedings
and
moved
to
dismiss
on
the
grounds
at
the
proceeding
interfered
with
the
prerogatives
of
the
united
states
senate
under
article
1
section
5.
on
december
1,
1970,
the
superior
court
of
marion
county
room
3
in
which
one
of
the
proceedings
was
pending
overruled
hartke’s
motion
to
dismiss
and
appointed
the
appellee’s
samuel
walker,
john
hammond,
and
dugg
butler
as
a
recount
commission,
the
directed
that
they
convene
on
december
8,
1970
and
commence
a
recount
of
the
votes.
on
december
3,
1970,
the
lake
circuit
court
also
overruled
hartke’s
motion
to
dismiss.
instead
of
seeking
relief
from
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
and
if
necessary
from
this
court,
appellee
hartke
instead
filed
a
compliant
for
injunctive
relief
in
the
court
below
on
december
3,
1970,
and
this
complaint
he
resided
the
proceedings
had
in
the
marion
county
election
and
alleged
that
the
recount
statute
conflicted
with
article
1
section
5
of
the
constitution.
jurisdiction
was
predicated
under
28
united
states
code
section
1343
subparagraph
3
which
confers
jurisdiction
on
the
district
courts
in
civil
right
actions.
generally,
the
complaint
alleged
that
the
defendants
acting
color
of
law
would
deprive
appellee
hartke
of
the
rights,
privileges
and
immunities,
secured
to
him
by
article
1,
section
5
of
the
constitution.
this
complaint
contained
no
explanation
by
relief
was
not
sought
on
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
that
contains
no
showing
of
irreparable
injury.
the
prayer
was
that
a
three-judge
court
be
convened
to
declare
article
27
of
the
election
code
unconstitutional
and
to
restrain
the
defendant’s
from
proceeding
with
the
recount.
along
with
the
complaint,
hartke
filed
a
verified
application
for
a
temporary
restraining
order.
in
this
application,
he
specifically
alleged
that
he
appeared
in
all
11
recount
proceedings
and
raised
the
constitutional
question
and
he
also
resided
that
the
ruling
of
the
marion
county
court
against
it.
not
withstanding
this,
the
district
judge
to
whom
the
application
was
presented
issued
a
temporary
restraining
order
without
notice,
although
the
recount
was
not
scheduled
to
commence
in
marion
county
for
another
five
days.
thereafter,
hartke
amended
his
complaint
and
theodore
l.
sendak
as
attorney
general
of
indiana
was
permitted
to
intervene
so
as
to
defend
--
to
be
heard
upon
the
constitutionality
of
the
recount
statute.
mr.

mr.
donald
a.
schabel
yes.
mr.
donald
a.
schabel
that
was
a
point
we
have
been
trying
to
make.
on
december
17,
1970,
a
hearing
was
held
before
a
three-judge
district
court
and
appellee
hartke's
request
for
a
preliminary
injunction
by
2:1
vote,
that
court
held
article
27
of
the
indiana
election
code
so
far
as
to
applies
to
races
for
the
united
states
senate
to
be
unconstitutional.
the
defendant’s
motions
to
dismiss
where
denied
and
the
interlocutory
injunction
requested
by
hartke
was
issued.
the
majority
and
minority
of
the
courts
subsequently
filed
opinions
but
made
no
separate
findings
of
fact
to
conclusions
of
law.
thereafter,
both
appellants
roudebush
and
sendak
filed
notices
of
appeal
and
on
january
13
and
15
of
1971,
jurisdictional
statements
were
filed
in
this
court.
when
the
92nd
congress
convened
on
january
21,
1971,
by
unanimous
consent
of
the
senate,
the
oath
was
administered
to
appellee
hartke
without
prejudice
to
this
appeal
or
to
any
recount
that
might
ensue.
thereafter,
hartke
moved
in
this
court
to
dismiss
the
appeals
as
moot
on
the
grounds
that
the
senate
had
already
judged
the
case
in
his
favor.
then
on
march
22,
1971
this
court
entered
no
corresponding
jurisdiction.
now,
with
respect
to
the
jurisdictional
question,
there
appeared
to
be
two
aspects.
the
first
is
the
court’s
jurisdiction
of
this,
a
direct
appeal
from
the
district
court;
this
other
aspect
is
appellee
hartke’s
contention
that
the
appeals
were
moot.
with
respect
to
jurisdiction,
this
court’s
jurisdiction
of
course
is
invoked
under
28
united
states
code,
section
1253.
jurisdiction
under
this
section
depends
upon
whether
the
case
was
one
required
to
be
heard
by
district
court
of
three
judges.
the
authority
to
convene
the
three-judge
court
in
this
case
rests
on
28
united
states
code
section
2281
which
is
set
out
on
page
8
of
appellant
roudebush’s
brief.
as
contemplated
by
this
section,
hartke’s
complaint
sought
injunctive
relief
against
the
enforcement
operation
and
execution
of
the
states’
statute
upon
the
grounds
of
the
constitutionality
of
that
statute.
so
far
the
case
is
squarely
within
the
statute.
but
for
2281
to
be
applicable,
the
injunction
must
restrain
the
action
of
an
officer
of
the
state
in
the
enforcement
or
execution
of
the
statute.
in
this
case,
the
duty
to
enforce
the
election
recount
statute
is
imposed
upon
the
circuit
in
superior
courts
to
the
various
counties
by
seeking
to
restrain
the
appellant
that
is
roudebush
from
taking
any
actions
whatsoever
to
affect
recount
procedures
under
the
recount
statute.
the
injunction
is
thus
directed
against
the
circuit
in
superior
courts
in
which
these
proceedings
were
pending.
it
has
been
recognized
for
many
years
that
restrain
of
a
party
initiating
that
proceeding
as
tantamount
to
restrain
the
court
in
which
the
proceeding
was
pending.
accordingly,
it
follows
that
a
three-judge
court
was
necessary
to
enter
the
injunction
sought
against
appellant
roudebush
because
such
injunction
necessarily
restrained
the
action
of
the
eleventh
circuit
or
superior
courts
and
the
officers
thereof
in
the
enforcement
and
execution
of
the
indiana
recount
statute.
now,
with
respect
to
the
other
aspect
of
jurisdiction,
i
do
not
think
hartke’s
contention
that
the
appeals
are
moot
need
detain
us
very
long.
first,
the
senate
itself
sworn
in
without
prejudice
to
this
appeal
and
suing
recount,
so
in
their
action
and
from
their
view
point
they
judge
nothing,
secondly,
the
term
for
deceit
and
dispute
does
not
expire
for
another
five
years
until
january
3,
1977.
so
i
do
not
think
it
could
be
said
that
there
are
not
live
issues
before
the
court.
now,
so
much
for
the
jurisdictional
issue
unless
there
are
questions
from
the
court.
mr.
donald
a.
schabel
yes!
because
we
were
initiated
within
the
proper
time
been
suspended
by
this
injunction
and
we
are
in
the
state
of
suspended
animation
right
now,
ready
to
go
forward
once
the
injunction
is
lifted.
now,
without
regard
to
the
applicability
of
the
anti-injunction
statute
or
to
the
alleged
unconstitutionality
of
the
recount
statute,
the
substantive
question
that
i
would
like
to
discuss
is
whether
the
interlocutory
injunction
was
proper
under
established
principles
of
equity
jurisprudence.
it
would
seem
to
be
a
hornbook
law
that
courts
of
equity
should
not
act
when
the
party
has
an
adequate
remedy
at
law
and
when
he
will
not
suffer
irreparable
injury
that
denied
equitable
relief.
in
this
case
as
i
have
already
said,
senator
hartke
interposed
its
constitutional
contentions
in
all
11
state
pending
recount
proceedings.
two
of
those
courts
rejected
his
contentions
and
ruled
against
him.
he
then
had
an
opportunity
to
reply
to
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
for
writ
of
prohibition
to
review
those
questions
and
if
necessary
had
a
right
to
appeal
to
this
court
under
28
united
states
code
section
1257
subparagraph
2,
and
bring
the
question
here.
instead
of
that,
being
sought
relief
from
the
district
court.
but
surely,
relief
from
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
and
from
this
court
would
constitute
an
adequate
remedy
for
proving
equitable
relief.
moreover,
his
complaint
neither
his
original
complaint
nor
his
amended
complaint
makes
any
allegation
concerning
irreparable
injury.
now,
it
is
no
answer
to
say
that
he
filed
a
application
for
temporary
restraining
order
in
which
he
tries
to
set
out
alleged
injury
because
that
application
was
not
part
of
the
pleadings,
and
it
was
not
even
served
under
defendants.
and
i,
myself
never
first
saw
it
until
i
was
preparing
this
appeal.
the
court
below
however
held
as
a
matter
of
law
that
hartke
would
suffer
irreparable
injury
and
only
authority
would
sign,
it
was
humpty
dumpy
stating
that
the
harm
to
be
avoided
would
take
place
immediately
and
irrevocably
once
the
case
seals
and
the
ballot
bags
are
broken.
but
the
breaking
of
the
seals
in
the
ballot
bags
could
not
cause
irreparable
injury
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first
under
the
statute,
the
court
in
which
the
recount
is
pending
instructed
by
the
statute,
can
pound
the
ballots
and
make
an
order
for
their
protection.
now
it
cannot
be
assumed
or
presumed
that
that
courts
is
not
going
to
do
its
duty.
next,
so
long
as
the
ballots
are
preserved
intact,
it
is
of
no
consequence
how
they
are
originally
counted
or
sorted.
and
finally,
since
the
senate
is
the
judge
of
the
elections
in
returns
of
its
members,
neither
the
original
count
nor
the
recount
a
binding
on
them.
so
regardless
of
what
happens
during
the
recount,
if
it
is
not
binding
on
the
senate,
it
can
not
cause
irreparable
injury
to
senator
hartke.
mr.
donald
a.
schabel
yes.
mr.
donald
a.
schabel
yes,
in
1968
and
no
challenge
to
the
guarantee
of
it
was
made
that
i
can
determine.
mr.
donald
a.
schabel
and
in
64.
mr.
donald
a.
schabel
well,--
mr.
donald
a.
schabel
well,
there
was
one
between
martin
o’connor
in
maryland
in
1946,
but
that
was
conducted
by
the
senate
itself
and
the
expressed
reason
there
was
that
the
maryland
law
contained
no
provision
for
a
recount.
therefore
the
senate
did
it.
mr.
donald
a.
schabel
well,
i
do
not
recall
any
between
tydings,
packwood
and
morris
and
laxalt
and
cannon
in
the
senate
and
plus
a
number
in
the
house.
now,
my
time
is
up
and
now
mr.
johnson
will
continue
with
the
argument.
thank
you.
mr.
donald
a.
schabel
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court.
i
will
be
very
brief
but
mr.
justice
marshall
already
asked
the
question
that
i
have
in
my
mind,
and
that
is
simply
if
the
indiana
recount
statute
is
so
unconstitutional,
why
did
not
the
appellee
seek
redress
there?
as
far
as
the
question
of
the
seating
of
senator
hartke
in
making
the
case
before
us
moot
is
concerned,
senator
hartke
was
asked
to
step
aside
at
the
time
the
oath
was
administered,
and
a
separate
oath
was
administered
to
him
in
which
he
swore
to
abide
with
the
constitution
and
so
forth.
but
subject
to
this
appeal
that
is
now
pending.
it
is
our
contention
that
this
was
a
conditional
seating
and
does
not
in
fact
moot
this
particular
case.
the
indiana
recount
statute
just
one
further
point,
the
indiana
recount
statute
is
in
aid
of
the
senate’s
power
to
judge
the
election
of
its
members,
not
interrogation
of
it.
thank
you.
mr.
donald
a.
schabel
may
i
please
the
court.
these
cases
are
here
on
direct
appeal
from
an
interlocutory
injunction
granted
by
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
indiana,
sitting
as
three-judge
court.
that
court
by
a
2:1
decision
held
article
27
of
the
indiana
election
code,
insofar
as
it
establishes
a
procedure
for
a
recount
of
the
votes
cast
for
the
office
of
united
states
senator
to
be
unconstitutional.
further
consideration,
the
question
of
this
court's
jurisdiction
has
been
postponed
to
the
hearing
of
the
cases
on
the
merits.
the
issues
presented
by
the
two
appeals
are
the
same.
in
addition
to
the
jurisdictional
issue,
the
questions
presented
are
as
follows:
without
regard
to
the
applicability
of
the
anti-injunction
statute
or
to
the
alleged
unconstitutionality
of
the
election
code,
first
substantive
question
presented
is
whether
the
interlocutory
injunction
was
proper
under
established
principles
of
equity
jurisprudence?
the
second
question
is
whether
the
interlocutory
injunction
appealed
from
is
prohibited
by
the
language
of
the
anti-injunction
statute.
the
third
question
presented
is
whether
article
27
of
the
indiana
election
code
insofar
as
it
establishes
a
procedure
for
a
recount
of
the
votes
cast
for
the
office
of
united
states
senator
conflicts
with
article
1,
section
5
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
which
makes
a
senate
the
judge
of
the
elections
returns
in
qualifications
of
its
members.
now,
i
am
dividing
the
time
of
the
appellants
with
mr.
richard
johnson,
so
i
shall
discuss
the
jurisdictional
issue
in
the
first
of
the
questions
i
have
stated.
mr.
johnson
will
discuss
the
second
and
third
questions.
before
addressing
myself
to
the
question
of
jurisdiction,
i
shall
first
state
the
relevant
facts.
appellant
roudebush
and
appellee
hartke
were
candidates
for
the
office
of
the
united
states
senator
at
the
january
election
held
in
the
state
of
indiana
on
november
3,
1970.
the
canvass
of
the
return
show
that
hartke
had
the
greater
number
of
votes
by
a
margin
of
4,383
votes
out
of
a
1,737,797
votes.
the
indiana
election
code
provides
that
any
candidate
for
any
office
voted
upon
in
any
election
held
in
the
state
of
indiana
including
specifically
the
office
of
the
united
states
senator
has
a
right
to
petition
for
a
recount
of
the
votes
cast
in
any
voting
precinct,
any
or
all
voting
precincts
of
the
state.
provided
he
petitions
in
the
appropriate
courts
within
15
days
after
the
election.
pursuant
to
this,
appellant
roudebush
filed
petitions
for
recount
on
november
17,
1970
in
certain
selected
precincts
in
11
indiana
counties.
two
days
later,
appellee
hartke
appeared
in
all
11
proceedings
and
moved
to
dismiss
on
the
grounds
at
the
proceeding
interfered
with
the
prerogatives
of
the
united
states
senate
under
article
1
section
5.
on
december
1,
1970,
the
superior
court
of
marion
county
room
3
in
which
one
of
the
proceedings
was
pending
overruled
hartke’s
motion
to
dismiss
and
appointed
the
appellee’s
samuel
walker,
john
hammond,
and
dugg
butler
as
a
recount
commission,
the
directed
that
they
convene
on
december
8,
1970
and
commence
a
recount
of
the
votes.
on
december
3,
1970,
the
lake
circuit
court
also
overruled
hartke’s
motion
to
dismiss.
instead
of
seeking
relief
from
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
and
if
necessary
from
this
court,
appellee
hartke
instead
filed
a
compliant
for
injunctive
relief
in
the
court
below
on
december
3,
1970,
and
this
complaint
he
resided
the
proceedings
had
in
the
marion
county
election
and
alleged
that
the
recount
statute
conflicted
with
article
1
section
5
of
the
constitution.
jurisdiction
was
predicated
under
28
united
states
code
section
1343
subparagraph
3
which
confers
jurisdiction
on
the
district
courts
in
civil
right
actions.
generally,
the
complaint
alleged
that
the
defendants
acting
color
of
law
would
deprive
appellee
hartke
of
the
rights,
privileges
and
immunities,
secured
to
him
by
article
1,
section
5
of
the
constitution.
this
complaint
contained
no
explanation
by
relief
was
not
sought
on
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
that
contains
no
showing
of
irreparable
injury.
the
prayer
was
that
a
three-judge
court
be
convened
to
declare
article
27
of
the
election
code
unconstitutional
and
to
restrain
the
defendant’s
from
proceeding
with
the
recount.
along
with
the
complaint,
hartke
filed
a
verified
application
for
a
temporary
restraining
order.
in
this
application,
he
specifically
alleged
that
he
appeared
in
all
11
recount
proceedings
and
raised
the
constitutional
question
and
he
also
resided
that
the
ruling
of
the
marion
county
court
against
it.
not
withstanding
this,
the
district
judge
to
whom
the
application
was
presented
issued
a
temporary
restraining
order
without
notice,
although
the
recount
was
not
scheduled
to
commence
in
marion
county
for
another
five
days.
thereafter,
hartke
amended
his
complaint
and
theodore
l.
sendak
as
attorney
general
of
indiana
was
permitted
to
intervene
so
as
to
defend
--
to
be
heard
upon
the
constitutionality
of
the
recount
statute.
mr.
donald

schabel

mr.
donald

is

other

mr.

mr.
donald
a.
schabel
yes.
mr.
donald
a.
schabel
that
was
a
point
we
have
been
trying
to
make.
on
december
17,
1970,
a
hearing
was
held
before
a
three-judge
district
court
and
appellee
hartke's
request
for
a
preliminary
injunction
by
2:1
vote,
that
court
held
article
27
of
the
indiana
election
code
so
far
as
to
applies
to
races
for
the
united
states
senate
to
be
unconstitutional.
the
defendant’s
motions
to
dismiss
where
denied
and
the
interlocutory
injunction
requested
by
hartke
was
issued.
the
majority
and
minority
of
the
courts
subsequently
filed
opinions
but
made
no
separate
findings
of
fact
to
conclusions
of
law.
thereafter,
both
appellants
roudebush
and
sendak
filed
notices
of
appeal
and
on
january
13
and
15
of
1971,
jurisdictional
statements
were
filed
in
this
court.
when
the
92nd
congress
convened
on
january
21,
1971,
by
unanimous
consent
of
the
senate,
the
oath
was
administered
to
appellee
hartke
without
prejudice
to
this
appeal
or
to
any
recount
that
might
ensue.
thereafter,
hartke
moved
in
this
court
to
dismiss
the
appeals
as
moot
on
the
grounds
that
the
senate
had
already
judged
the
case
in
his
favor.
then
on
march
22,
1971
this
court
entered
no
corresponding
jurisdiction.
now,
with
respect
to
the
jurisdictional
question,
there
appeared
to
be
two
aspects.
the
first
is
the
court’s
jurisdiction
of
this,
a
direct
appeal
from
the
district
court;
this
other
aspect
is
appellee
hartke’s
contention
that
the
appeals
were
moot.
with
respect
to
jurisdiction,
this
court’s
jurisdiction
of
course
is
invoked
under
28
united
states
code,
section
1253.
jurisdiction
under
this
section
depends
upon
whether
the
case
was
one
required
to
be
heard
by
district
court
of
three
judges.
the
authority
to
convene
the
three-judge
court
in
this
case
rests
on
28
united
states
code
section
2281
which
is
set
out
on
page
8
of
appellant
roudebush’s
brief.
as
contemplated
by
this
section,
hartke’s
complaint
sought
injunctive
relief
against
the
enforcement
operation
and
execution
of
the
states’
statute
upon
the
grounds
of
the
constitutionality
of
that
statute.
so
far
the
case
is
squarely
within
the
statute.
but
for
2281
to
be
applicable,
the
injunction
must
restrain
the
action
of
an
officer
of
the
state
in
the
enforcement
or
execution
of
the
statute.
in
this
case,
the
duty
to
enforce
the
election
recount
statute
is
imposed
upon
the
circuit
in
superior
courts
to
the
various
counties
by
seeking
to
restrain
the
appellant
that
is
roudebush
from
taking
any
actions
whatsoever
to
affect
recount
procedures
under
the
recount
statute.
the
injunction
is
thus
directed
against
the
circuit
in
superior
courts
in
which
these
proceedings
were
pending.
it
has
been
recognized
for
many
years
that
restrain
of
a
party
initiating
that
proceeding
as
tantamount
to
restrain
the
court
in
which
the
proceeding
was
pending.
accordingly,
it
follows
that
a
three-judge
court
was
necessary
to
enter
the
injunction
sought
against
appellant
roudebush
because
such
injunction
necessarily
restrained
the
action
of
the
eleventh
circuit
or
superior
courts
and
the
officers
thereof
in
the
enforcement
and
execution
of
the
indiana
recount
statute.
now,
with
respect
to
the
other
aspect
of
jurisdiction,
i
do
not
think
hartke’s
contention
that
the
appeals
are
moot
need
detain
us
very
long.
first,
the
senate
itself
sworn
in
without
prejudice
to
this
appeal
and
suing
recount,
so
in
their
action
and
from
their
view
point
they
judge
nothing,
secondly,
the
term
for
deceit
and
dispute
does
not
expire
for
another
five
years
until
january
3,
1977.
so
i
do
not
think
it
could
be
said
that
there
are
not
live
issues
before
the
court.
now,
so
much
for
the
jurisdictional
issue
unless
there
are
questions
from
the
court.
mr.
donald
a.
schabel
yes!
because
we
were
initiated
within
the
proper
time
been
suspended
by
this
injunction
and
we
are
in
the
state
of
suspended
animation
right
now,
ready
to
go
forward
once
the
injunction
is
lifted.
now,
without
regard
to
the
applicability
of
the
anti-injunction
statute
or
to
the
alleged
unconstitutionality
of
the
recount
statute,
the
substantive
question
that
i
would
like
to
discuss
is
whether
the
interlocutory
injunction
was
proper
under
established
principles
of
equity
jurisprudence.
it
would
seem
to
be
a
hornbook
law
that
courts
of
equity
should
not
act
when
the
party
has
an
adequate
remedy
at
law
and
when
he
will
not
suffer
irreparable
injury
that
denied
equitable
relief.
in
this
case
as
i
have
already
said,
senator
hartke
interposed
its
constitutional
contentions
in
all
11
state
pending
recount
proceedings.
two
of
those
courts
rejected
his
contentions
and
ruled
against
him.
he
then
had
an
opportunity
to
reply
to
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
for
writ
of
prohibition
to
review
those
questions
and
if
necessary
had
a
right
to
appeal
to
this
court
under
28
united
states
code
section
1257
subparagraph
2,
and
bring
the
question
here.
instead
of
that,
being
sought
relief
from
the
district
court.
but
surely,
relief
from
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
and
from
this
court
would
constitute
an
adequate
remedy
for
proving
equitable
relief.
moreover,
his
complaint
neither
his
original
complaint
nor
his
amended
complaint
makes
any
allegation
concerning
irreparable
injury.
now,
it
is
no
answer
to
say
that
he
filed
a
application
for
temporary
restraining
order
in
which
he
tries
to
set
out
alleged
injury
because
that
application
was
not
part
of
the
pleadings,
and
it
was
not
even
served
under
defendants.
and
i,
myself
never
first
saw
it
until
i
was
preparing
this
appeal.
the
court
below
however
held
as
a
matter
of
law
that
hartke
would
suffer
irreparable
injury
and
only
authority
would
sign,
it
was
humpty
dumpy
stating
that
the
harm
to
be
avoided
would
take
place
immediately
and
irrevocably
once
the
case
seals
and
the
ballot
bags
are
broken.
but
the
breaking
of
the
seals
in
the
ballot
bags
could
not
cause
irreparable
injury
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first
under
the
statute,
the
court
in
which
the
recount
is
pending
instructed
by
the
statute,
can
pound
the
ballots
and
make
an
order
for
their
protection.
now
it
cannot
be
assumed
or
presumed
that
that
courts
is
not
going
to
do
its
duty.
next,
so
long
as
the
ballots
are
preserved
intact,
it
is
of
no
consequence
how
they
are
originally
counted
or
sorted.
and
finally,
since
the
senate
is
the
judge
of
the
elections
in
returns
of
its
members,
neither
the
original
count
nor
the
recount
a
binding
on
them.
so
regardless
of
what
happens
during
the
recount,
if
it
is
not
binding
on
the
senate,
it
can
not
cause
irreparable
injury
to
senator
hartke.
mr.
donald
a.
schabel
yes.
mr.
donald
a.
schabel
yes,
in
1968
and
no
challenge
to
the
guarantee
of
it
was
made
that
i
can
determine.
mr.
donald
a.
schabel
and
in
64.
mr.
donald
a.
schabel
well,--
mr.
donald
a.
schabel
well,
there
was
one
between
martin
o’connor
in
maryland
in
1946,
but
that
was
conducted
by
the
senate
itself
and
the
expressed
reason
there
was
that
the
maryland
law
contained
no
provision
for
a
recount.
therefore
the
senate
did
it.
mr.
donald
a.
schabel
well,
i
do
not
recall
any
between
tydings,
packwood
and
morris
and
laxalt
and
cannon
in
the
senate
and
plus
a
number
in
the
house.
now,
my
time
is
up
and
now
mr.
johnson
will
continue
with
the
argument.
thank
you.
mr.
donald
a.
schabel
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court.
i
will
be
very
brief
but
mr.
justice
marshall
already
asked
the
question
that
i
have
in
my
mind,
and
that
is
simply
if
the
indiana
recount
statute
is
so
unconstitutional,
why
did
not
the
appellee
seek
redress
there?
as
far
as
the
question
of
the
seating
of
senator
hartke
in
making
the
case
before
us
moot
is
concerned,
senator
hartke
was
asked
to
step
aside
at
the
time
the
oath
was
administered,
and
a
separate
oath
was
administered
to
him
in
which
he
swore
to
abide
with
the
constitution
and
so
forth.
but
subject
to
this
appeal
that
is
now
pending.
it
is
our
contention
that
this
was
a
conditional
seating
and
does
not
in
fact
moot
this
particular
case.
the
indiana
recount
statute
just
one
further
point,
the
indiana
recount
statute
is
in
aid
of
the
senate’s
power
to
judge
the
election
of
its
members,
not
interrogation
of
it.
thank
you.
