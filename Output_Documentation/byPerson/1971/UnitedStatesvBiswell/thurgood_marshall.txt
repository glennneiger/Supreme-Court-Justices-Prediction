can
flush
a

down
the

justice
thurgood

does
that
apply
to
all
the
liquor
laws?
justice
thurgood

do
you
have
the
outsets
in
three
--
all
cases?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
your
point
is,
whether
or
not
they
can
be
licensed.
is
that
your
point?
justice
thurgood
marshall
whether
or
not
they
can
be
required
to
have
a
license.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
would
be
the
purpose
of
the
license?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
could
that
be
found
out
without
inspection?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
in
the
colonnade
they
had
found
poisoned
whisky.
it’s
your
position
that
there’s
nothing
the
government
could
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
is
--
well,
suppose
the
poisoned
whisky
is
sitting
on
the
counter
outside?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
is
the
same
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
what
i’m
saying.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
there’s
no
objection
to
that.
but
not
if
they
go
into
back
them
and
they
find
poisoned
whisky,
they
can’t
use
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i’d
think
--
and
by
the
time
they
got
to
the
door
to
get
ready
to
go
to
get
the
search
warrant,
where
would
of
course
the
whisky
be?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
i’d
--
the
only
purpose
was
you
don’t
oppose
the
licensee.
you
are
not
opposed
to
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you’re
not
opposed
to
being
licensed
on
the
statute
which
says
you
shall
let
them
in?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
thought
you
said
you
didn’t
mind
the
inspections
so
long
as
they
didn’t
use
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
are
number
of
reports
that
the

has
to

with
the

how
much
privacy
does
he
got
left?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
he
on
notice
that
if
an
inspection
is
made
which
comes
out
as
a
search
that
the
material
found
can
be
used
against
him.
he
hasn’t
consented
to
that,
has
he?
justice
thurgood

you
know
the
--
you
said
they
already
consent
it
was
because
he
assumed
he’s
dead
but
there’s
