mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
it
please
the
court.
our
position
is
far
as
issue
one
is
concerned
in
the
petition
brief
is
that
not
only
does
the
gun
inspection
statute
violate
the
fifth
amendment
rights
of
the
respondent,
i
mean
the
fourth
amendment,
it
also
violates
the
fifth.
that
by
forcing
upon
him
the
obligation
to
allow
inspection
he
thereby
incriminates
himself
of
any
criminal
acts
are
discovered.
at
the
outset,
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
this
came
up,
i
don’t
believe
that
it
was
relevant
to
the
argument
before
the
court
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
mr.
biswell
was
found
innocent
for
possession
charges
of
the
guns
and
found
guilty
of
not
being
licensed.
so
query,
what
did
the
jury
believe?
i
believe
we
are
all
confused
about
that
outcome.
but
getting
to
the
constitutional
question,
actually
what
the
petitioner
is
advocating
here
is
the
same
thing
that
franks
did
which
this
court
overruled
later
that
is
create
an
additional
exception
to
general
rule
under
the
constitution
that
there
must
be
a
search
warrant
with
probable
cause
before
you
can
search
not
only
private
homes
but
the
private
portions
of
the
premises
of
businessmen.
and
in
frank
as
the
court
recalls
the
court
in
that
case
said
well,
if
this
is
an
administrative
search
which
is
essentially
civil
in
nature,
no
criminal
investigation
that
there
are
safeguards
then
we
will
allow
such
a
search
and
call
it
to
be
constitutional.
the
--
this
court
in
the
colonnade
case
which
see
followed
as
far
as
commercial
premises
are
concerned
indicated
otherwise.
at
the
outset
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
it
is
the
respondent’s
feeling
that
there
is
a
much
greater
issue
facing
this
court
today
other
than
just
the
gun
statute
which
is
a
subject
to
this
case.
as
the
petitioner
cited
in
his
brief,
in
his
footnotes,
there
are
some
dozen
pieces
of
federal
legislation
existing
today
which
call
for
inspection
of
premises
of
businessmen
all
the
way
from
poultry,
drugs
onto
to
a
new
act
which
we
have
now
the
national
safety
and
health
practices
act.
now,
prior
to
the
enactment
of
this
act
most
of
these
acts
where
a
specialized
area
of
business
and
probably
didn’t
step
on
the
toes
of
these
many
people
as
this
new
act
will.
this
act
covers
all
employers
whose
businesses
are
engaged
in
commerce
and
it
contains
penalties
of
up
to
$20,000.00
in
one
year
for
violations.
so
i
think
that
--
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
this
is
the
safety
and
health
practices
act
mr.
justice.
it’s
pointed
at
unsafe
practices
on
business
premises
that
are
injuring
employees
and
they
have
an
inspection
provision
in
there.
no
call
for
search
warrant
and
they
have
very
heavy
penalties.
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
the
reference
to
statute
is
in
the
petitioner’s
brief,
your
honor.
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
yes.
yes,
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
i
think
it
goes
to
machinery,
almost
any
type
of
unsafe
practice.
and
the
statute
calls
for
inspections,
in
fact
it
calls
for
surprise
inspections.
it’s
a
similar
nature
to
your
banking
statute
but
it
has
far
reaching
effects
and
i
think
–-
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
if
it
please
the
court,
i
think
they
violate
both
amendments.
first
they
violate
the
fourth
amendment
because
they
evade
the
privacy
right
that
we
have
under
the
fourth
and
we
also
invade
our
self
protection
right
but
not
only
that
they
also
invade
the
fifth
amendment
whereby
we’re
guarantee
right
not
to
be
self-incriminated
and
the
large
--
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
if
it
please
the
court.
its
evidence
against
a
licensee
in
this
situation
and
if
according
to
--
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
yes.
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
i’ll
please
the
court.
i
know
this
court
overruled
franks
but
franks
did
indicate
that
there
was
also
the
fifth
amendment
danger
in
this
sort
of
situation
in
that
if
i
--
as
a
condition
of
a
license
have
a
duty
to
inspect
which
the
government
contends
then
i
in
essence
have
submitted
myself
to
the
government
obtaining
evidence
against
me
which
will
be
incriminating.
this
is
what
the
government
is
arguing.
that
actually
there’s
an
implied
consent
here
to
the
search.
and
that
as
a
requirement
of
the
license
is
the
--
in
the
giving
of
a
privilege
the
government
requires
that
i
give
up
my
fourth
and
fifth
amendment
rights.
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
well,
i
think
it’s
a
broad
proposition,
your
honor.
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
and
i
think
the
court
recognize
it
franks
where
they
indicated
that
they
recognize
the
fact
that
in
almost
all
of
the
search
and
seizures,
it
were
condemned
under
the
fourth
amendment.
they’re
also
condemnable
under
the
fifth
amendment
in
enforcing
a
man
to
have
his
premises
searched
without
consent
so
that
he’ll
be
incriminated.
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
i
believe
it
is,
your
honor.
i
think
it
is
more
applicable
to
be
pointed
out
in
this
case.
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
yes
and
it’s
introduced
against
them.
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
i
think
it
would,
your
honor
and
--
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
i
realize
that
but
i
think
that
the
safeguards.
i
mean,
this
is
my
feeling
there
is
no
specific
language
but
i
believe
the
safeguards
that
were
spoken
of
in
colonnade
were
more
broad
than
just
the
mere
procedure
that
an
inspector
went
through.
i
think
the
safeguards
and
the
only
safeguard
that
any
person
in
this
position
who
is
a
licensee
and
whose
premises
must
be
inspected
and
if
the
courts
fail
that
it’s
in
the
public
interest
they
must
be
inspected
then
there
should
be
a
provision
in
that
act
that
any
infractions
found
of
a
criminal
nature
would
not
be
use
as
evidence
against
the
many
criminal
proceeding.
this
would
be
similar
to
the
haynes,
the
legislation
that
arose
out
of
the
haynes
decision.
the
haynes
decisions
in
1968,
the
congress
and
the
federal
farms
act
enacted
a
statute
specifically
to
overcome
the
effect
in
that
case.
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
no,
i
am
not
disputing
the
fact
that
the
requirement
to
have
a
license
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
the
purpose
of
the
license
would
be
to
insure
compliance
with
the
act
and
ensure
that
a
proper
--
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
oh!
i
--
what
i
am
--
what
i
have
not
--
i
am
not
saying
per
se
inspection
should
not
be
in
the
statutes.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
on
a
case
by
case
basis,
this
court
and
the
lower
courts
look
at
the
situation
that
if
the
public
interest
is
not
deterred
by
requiring
a
search
warrant
then
let’s
protect
the
privacy
interest
of
the
businessmen.
these
statutes
are
rapidly
encroaching
upon
all
areas
of
our
life
and
on
the
other
hand
if
that
is
in
colonnade
and
if
the
government
is
correct
--
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
my
suggestion
is
that
they
should
have
gotten
a
search
warrant
in
that
case,
your
honor.
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
on
the
counter
outside,
well,
i
think
there’s
been
a
decision
that
if
it’s
in
a
public
area
then
certainly
it
can
be
inspected.
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
well,
this
wasn’t
a
public
area.
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
yes.
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
not
unless
they
have
a
search
warrant.
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
well,
i
believe
that
we’ve
had
several
cases
outside
into
my
brief
that
said
this;
no
problem
is
one
of
the
options
hanging
around
keeping
them
from
disposing
this.
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
no,
i’m
not
opposed
to
the
licensee.
i
am
not
opposed
to
the
inspection.
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
i
am
opposed
to
inspections
into
--
in
the
alternative.
number
one
--
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
so
long
as
they
–-
well,
number
one,
i
think
we
have
to
first
look
at
the
area
of
the
businessman’s
privacy.
now
i
think
on
a
case
by
case
basis
the
court
should
balance
the
interest
of
the
privacy
guarantee
under
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
he
doesn’t
have
much,
your
honor.
but
what
i’m
trying
to
say
is
that
actually,
there
has
to
be
a
balance
on
a
case
by
case
basis,
the
privacy
of
businessman
versus
the
interest
to
the
public
for
the
particular
act
to
be
implemented.
now
if
this
court
sees
fit
to
say
that
the
interest
of
the
public
is
greater
than
the
fourth
amendment
interest
of
privacy,
then
at
that
point
it
is
our
position
that
anything
discovered
during
such
an
inspection
should
not
be
used
in
a
criminal
prosecution
against
them.
revoke
his
license,
put
him
out
of
the
business
but
let’s
not
force
him
as
a
privilege
of
doing
business
be
subject
to
criminal
persecution.
this
is
what
happened
in
--
as
a
parallel
like
i
said
in
haynes
cases.
this
is
what
happened
with
subsequent
legislation.
they
said
from
now
on
you
still
have
to
register
guns
but
we
aren’t
going
to
use
that
evidence
against
you
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
and
there’s
no
reason
why
we
can’t
do
that
in
these
inspections
statutes.
we
still
accomplish
the
purpose.
we
inspect.
we
see
that
there’s
no
illegal
activity.
we
are
able
to
trace
guns
to
clear
up
criminal
activity.
on
the
other
hand,
we
don’t
take
away
this
man’s
constitutional
rights
as
a
privilege
of
doing
business
and
this
court
has
condemned
that
in
other
cases.
on
the
other
hand,
if
he
doesn’t
fulfill
his
obligations
as
a
gun
dealer,
let’s
take
his
license
away
from
him.
but
let’s
not
throw
him
in
jail
because
we
have
granted
him
a
privilege
and
in
turn
took
away
his
constitutional
rights.
this
could
be
done
in
lots
of
areas.
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
i
probably
would,
your
honor
but
i
don’t
think
it
would
be
a
strong
--
[laughter].
there
we’re
dealing
with
a
civil
right.
here
we’re
dealing
with
criminal
prosecution.
we’re
dealing
with
sentences
up
to
five
years
in
jail,
incidentally
he
received
a
two-year
sentence.
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
if
it
please
the
court.
there
seems
to
be
two
areas
of
dicta
in
that
case.
on
the
one
hand,
the
court
seems
to
attempt
to
distinguish
colonnade
from
see
and
the
other
case.
but
on
the
other
hand,
the
court
did
make
a
broad
statement
that
there
were
not
reasonable
safeguards
in
the
statute
and
that
as
a
consequence
they
were
going
to
hold
that
the
fourth
amendment
have
to
apply.
then
they
went
on
and
stated
that
the
congress
did
not
authorize
a
remedy
of
forcible
entry
when
consent
was
refused
merely
a
criminal
penalty.
but
i
think
that
the
issue
was
really
narrow
in
colonnade
and
i
think
there
is
enough
dicta
there
to
there
indicate
that
this
court
would
look
at
it
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
yes,
but
i
don’t
think
the
court
even
went
this
far
to
say
that
even
in
the
colonnade
case.
i
don’t
think
it
went
as
far
to
say
that
the
government
has
an
absolute
right
to
inspect
but
you
can’t
bust
in
the
door.
they
did
talk
about
safeguards
in
here.
they
didn’t
tell
us
what
safeguards.
but
they
did
talk
about
them.
and
they
said
they
were
no
safeguards
and
this
certainly
isn’t
contradictory
to
camara
and
see.
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
i
don’t
read
it
quite
that
narrow,
your
honor.
i
think
it’s
a
broader
holding,
it’s
unfortunate
that
it
was
a
forced
entry.
maybe
we
would
have
a
clearer
decision
today.
but
i
think
that
this
court
should
look
at
camara
and
see
and
go
over
the
factors
that
went
over
we’re
gone
over
by
this
court
in
that
case
and
determine
this
case
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
thank
you.
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
it
please
the
court.
our
position
is
far
as
issue
one
is
concerned
in
the
petition
brief
is
that
not
only
does
the
gun
inspection
statute
violate
the
fifth

rights
of
the
respondent,
i

the

it
also
violates
the
fifth.
that
by

the

both
amendments.
first
they
violate
the
fourth
amendment
because
they
evade
the
privacy
right
that
we
have
under
the
fourth
and
we
also
invade
our
self
protection
right
but
not
only
that
they
also
invade
the
fifth
amendment
whereby
we’re
guarantee
right
not
to
be
self-incriminated
and
the
large
--
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
if
it
please
the
court.
its
evidence
against
a
licensee
in
this
situation
and
if
according
to
--
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
yes.
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
i’ll
please
the
court.
i
know
this
court
overruled
franks
but
franks
did
indicate
that
there
was
also
the
fifth
amendment
danger
in
this
sort
of
situation
in
that
if
i
--
as
a
condition
of
a
license
have
a
duty
to
inspect
which
the
government
contends
then
i
in
essence
have
submitted
myself
to
the
government
obtaining
evidence
against
me
which
will
be
incriminating.
this
is
what
the
government
is
arguing.
that
actually
there’s
an
implied
consent
here
to
the
search.
and
that
as
a
requirement
of
the
license
is
the
--
in
the
giving
of
a
privilege
the
government
requires
that
i
give
up
my
fourth
and
fifth
amendment
rights.
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
well,
i
think
it’s
a
broad
proposition,
your
honor.
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
and
i
think
the
court
recognize
it
franks
where
they
indicated
that
they
recognize
the
fact
that
in
almost
all
of
the
search
and
seizures,
it
were
condemned
under
the
fourth
amendment.
they’re
also
condemnable
under
the
fifth
amendment
in
enforcing
a
man
to
have
his
premises
searched
without
consent
so
that
he’ll
be
incriminated.
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
i
believe
it
is,
your
honor.
i
think
it
is
more
applicable
to
be
pointed
out
in
this
case.
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
yes
and
it’s
introduced
against
them.
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
i
think
it
would,
your
honor
and
--
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
i
realize
that
but
i
think
that
the
safeguards.
i
mean,
this
is
my
feeling
there
is
no
specific
language
but
i
believe
the
safeguards
that
were
spoken
of
in
colonnade
were
more
broad
than
just
the
mere
procedure
that
an
inspector
went
through.
i
think
the
safeguards
and
the
only
safeguard
that
any
person
in
this
position
who
is
a
licensee
and
whose
premises
must
be
inspected
and
if
the
courts
fail
that
it’s
in
the
public
interest
they
must
be
inspected
then
there
should
be
a
provision
in
that
act
that
any
infractions
found
of
a
criminal
nature
would
not
be
use
as
evidence
against
the
many
criminal
proceeding.
this
would
be
similar
to
the
haynes,
the
legislation
that
arose
out
of
the
haynes
decision.
the
haynes
decisions
in
1968,
the
congress
and
the
federal
farms
act
enacted
a
statute
specifically
to
overcome
the
effect
in
that
case.
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
no,
i
am
not
disputing
the
fact
that
the
requirement
to
have
a
license
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
the
purpose
of
the
license
would
be
to
insure
compliance
with
the
act
and
ensure
that
a
proper
--
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
oh!
i
--
what
i
am
--
what
i
have
not
--
i
am
not
saying
per
se
inspection
should
not
be
in
the
statutes.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
on
a
case
by
case
basis,
this
court
and
the
lower
courts
look
at
the
situation
that
if
the
public
interest
is
not
deterred
by
requiring
a
search
warrant
then
let’s
protect
the
privacy
interest
of
the
businessmen.
these
statutes
are
rapidly
encroaching
upon
all
areas
of
our
life
and
on
the
other
hand
if
that
is
in
colonnade
and
if
the
government
is
correct
--
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
my
suggestion
is
that
they
should
have
gotten
a
search
warrant
in
that
case,
your
honor.
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
on
the
counter
outside,
well,
i
think
there’s
been
a
decision
that
if
it’s
in
a
public
area
then
certainly
it
can
be
inspected.
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
well,
this
wasn’t
a
public
area.
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
yes.
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
not
unless
they
have
a
search
warrant.
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
well,
i
believe
that
we’ve
had
several
cases
outside
into
my
brief
that
said
this;
no
problem
is
one
of
the
options
hanging
around
keeping
them
from
disposing
this.
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
no,
i’m
not
opposed
to
the
licensee.
i
am
not
opposed
to
the
inspection.
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
i
am
opposed
to
inspections
into
--
in
the
alternative.
number
one
--
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
so
long
as
they
–-
well,
number
one,
i
think
we
have
to
first
look
at
the
area
of
the
businessman’s
privacy.
now
i
think
on
a
case
by
case
basis
the
court
should
balance
the
interest
of
the
privacy
guarantee
under
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
he
doesn’t
have
much,
your
honor.
but
what
i’m
trying
to
say
is
that
actually,
there
has
to
be
a
balance
on
a
case
by
case
basis,
the
privacy
of
businessman
versus
the
interest
to
the
public
for
the
particular
act
to
be
implemented.
now
if
this
court
sees
fit
to
say
that
the
interest
of
the
public
is
greater
than
the
fourth
amendment
interest
of
privacy,
then
at
that
point
it
is
our
position
that
anything
discovered
during
such
an
inspection
should
not
be
used
in
a
criminal
prosecution
against
them.
revoke
his
license,
put
him
out
of
the
business
but
let’s
not
force
him
as
a
privilege
of
doing
business
be
subject
to
criminal
persecution.
this
is
what
happened
in
--
as
a
parallel
like
i
said
in
haynes
cases.
this
is
what
happened
with
subsequent
legislation.
they
said
from
now
on
you
still
have
to
register
guns
but
we
aren’t
going
to
use
that
evidence
against
you
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
and
there’s
no
reason
why
we
can’t
do
that
in
these
inspections
statutes.
we
still
accomplish
the
purpose.
we
inspect.
we
see
that
there’s
no
illegal
activity.
we
are
able
to
trace
guns
to
clear
up
criminal
activity.
on
the
other
hand,
we
don’t
take
away
this
man’s
constitutional
rights
as
a
privilege
of
doing
business
and
this
court
has
condemned
that
in
other
cases.
on
the
other
hand,
if
he
doesn’t
fulfill
his
obligations
as
a
gun
dealer,
let’s
take
his
license
away
from
him.
but
let’s
not
throw
him
in
jail
because
we
have
granted
him
a
privilege
and
in
turn
took
away
his
constitutional
rights.
this
could
be
done
in
lots
of
areas.
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
i
probably
would,
your
honor
but
i
don’t
think
it
would
be
a
strong
--
[laughter].
there
we’re
dealing
with
a
civil
right.
here
we’re
dealing
with
criminal
prosecution.
we’re
dealing
with
sentences
up
to
five
years
in
jail,
incidentally
he
received
a
two-year
sentence.
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
if
it
please
the
court.
there
seems
to
be
two
areas
of
dicta
in
that
case.
on
the
one
hand,
the
court
seems
to
attempt
to
distinguish
colonnade
from
see
and
the
other
case.
but
on
the
other
hand,
the
court
did
make
a
broad
statement
that
there
were
not
reasonable
safeguards
in
the
statute
and
that
as
a
consequence
they
were
going
to
hold
that
the
fourth
amendment
have
to
apply.
then
they
went
on
and
stated
that
the
congress
did
not
authorize
a
remedy
of
forcible
entry
when
consent
was
refused
merely
a
criminal
penalty.
but
i
think
that
the
issue
was
really
narrow
in
colonnade
and
i
think
there
is
enough
dicta
there
to
there
indicate
that
this
court
would
look
at
it
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
yes,
but
i
don’t
think
the
court
even
went
this
far
to
say
that
even
in
the
colonnade
case.
i
don’t
think
it
went
as
far
to
say
that
the
government
has
an
absolute
right
to
inspect
but
you
can’t
bust
in
the
door.
they
did
talk
about
safeguards
in
here.
they
didn’t
tell
us
what
safeguards.
but
they
did
talk
about
them.
and
they
said
they
were
no
safeguards
and
this
certainly
isn’t
contradictory
to
camara
and
see.
mr.
warren
f.
reynolds
i
don’t
read
it
quite
that
narrow,
your
honor.
i
think
it’s
a
broader
holding,
it’s
unfortunate
that
it
was
a
forced
entry.
maybe
we
would
have
a
clearer
decision
today.
but
i
think
that
this
court
should
look
at
camara
and
see
and
go
over
the
factors
that
went
over
we’re
gone
over
by
this
court
in
that
case
and
determine
this
case
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
thank
you.
