mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
on
review
of
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
that
an
agent
of
the
alcohol,
tobacco,
and
firearms
division
of
the
treasury
department
searched
respondent
biswell’s
business
premises
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
the
issue
involved
is
a
narrow
one.
whether
congress
in
regulating
the
distribution
of
firearms,
may
authorize
treasury
agents
to
make
routine
inspections
during
business
hours
of
the
business
premises
of
licensed
dealers
in
firearms
and
whether
congress
may
impost
upon
these
licensed
dealers
a
duty
to
admit
the
agents
even
though
the
agents
do
not
possess
a
warrant.
putting
the
question
somewhat
differently,
thus
the
congressional
authorization
of
such
inspections
and
the
imposition
of
a
duty
upon
licensed
dealers
to
admit
the
agents
without
warrants
conflict
with
the
fourth
amendment.
we
believe
the
constitutionality
of
the
authorization
and
the
duty
congress
has
imposed
is
plain
under
colonnade
catering
corporation
versus
united
states
and
that
therefore
the
court
below
erred.
the
relevant
facts
in
this
case
are
quite
straight
forward.
loarn
anthony
biswell
is
a
pawnbroker
in
hobbs,
new
mexico.
a
substantial
number
of
the
items
pawned
with
him
as
security
for
loans
are
firearms.
at
the
time
of
the
inspection
here
he
held
some
444
firearms.
biswell
was
a
licensed
dealer
of
firearms.
under
section
923
of
title
18,
dealers
and
firearms
must
be
licensed
and
dealers
who
are
explicitly
defined
to
include
pawnbrokers.
special
investigator
hupp
of
the
alcohol,
tobacco
and
firearms
division
made
a
routine
compliance
visit
to
biswell’s
pawnshop.
according
to
hupp,
such
visits
of
dealers
are
made
about
once
a
year.
hupp
identified
himself
and
first
inquired
about
biswell’s
records.
he
ascertained
that
biswell
was
not
keeping
records
in
the
form
required
of
all
firearms
dealers.
hupp
then
indicated
that
he
wish
to
see
the
storerooms
where
the
firearms
were
kept.
biswell
kept
these
along
with
other
pawned
items
in
a
locked
storage
room.
biswell
inquired
if
hupp
got
a
search
warrant
and
hupp
said
no
but
he
showed
biswell
a
copy
of
the
statute
authorizing
treasury
agents
to
search
the
business
premises
of
firearms
dealers
without
warrants.
at
that
point,
biswell
said,
well,
that’s
what
it
says
so
i
guess
it
is
okay
and
he
unlocked
the
storeroom.
inside
the
storeroom,
hupp
saw
a
rifle
with
an
11
and
3
quarter
inch
barrel.
any
rifle
with
a
barrel
of
less
than
16
inches
is
an
illegal
firearm
under
the
national
firearms
act
of
1968.
that
act
does
not
absolutely
forbid
possession
of
such
firearms
but
sharply
constricts
a
rightful
possession
and
commerce
in
such
firearms.
each
set
of
firearm
must
have
serial
number,
each
dealer
in
such
firearms
must
pay
a
special
occupational
tax
and
be
specially
registered
with
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
whenever
any
such
firearm
is
transferred,
the
transferor
must
pay
a
$200.00
transfer
tax
and
obtain
approval
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury.
it
was
clear
to
agent
hupp
that
biswell
did
not
legally
possess
the
sort
of
rifle
he
saw.
there
was
no
required
serial
number
on
the
rifle.
biswell
indicated
that
he
had
no
idea
such
weapons
had
to
be
specially
registered.
finally,
it
was
obvious
that
no
owner
would
pay
transfer
tax
of
$200.00
to
get
a
$3.00
loan
although
of
course
hupp
didn’t
know
the
amount
of
the
loan
but
he
knew
it
was
much
less
than
$200.00
from
a
pawnbroker.
soon
after
seeing
this
rifle,
hupp
noticed
another
with
a
short
barrel
and
he
seize
both
rifles.
the
district
judge
denied
a
motion
to
suppress
the
two
sort
of
rifles
and
they
were
introduced
at
biswell’s
trial.
they
in
the
observations
of
them
by
agent
hupp
irrelevant
to
the
count
for
which
biswell
was
convicted,
engaging
as
a
dealer
on
illegal
firearms
without
having
paid
this
special
occupational
tax.
among
other
claims
on
appeal,
biswell
asserted
that
the
search
leading
to
the
seizure
of
the
rifles
was
unconstitutional.
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
that
the
search
was
unconstitutional
and
that
the
evidence
should’ve
been
suppressed
and
it
reversed
the
conviction.
i
think
it
may
be
useful
that
the
outset
to
put
aside
what
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
there
is
no
assertion
by
biswell
that
hupp
performed
other
than
routine
actions
under
the
statute.
it
is
not
disputed
that
he
was
engaged
in
the
periodic
compliance
visit.
it
is
not
disputed
that
such
visits
typically
involved
inspection
of
the
firearms
on
the
premises
and
if
the
entry
into
the
storeroom
was
valid,
the
appropriateness
of
the
seizure
of
the
two
clearly
contraband
weapons
is
not
challenged.
at
the
same
time
it
is
clear
that
biswell
unlocked
the
door
of
the
storeroom
because
he
acquiesced
in
an
apparent
show
of
the
lawful
authority.
in
an
ordinary
criminal
investigation,
his
action
would
not
of
constituted
consent
to
an
otherwise
unauthorize
search.
thus,
we
do
not
argue
that
this
search
was
consented
to
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
consent.
the
case
thus
presents
very
clearly,
the
power
of
congress
to
authorize
treasury
agents
responsible
for
enforcement
of
the
firearms
laws
to
authorize
those
agents
to
inspect
the
business
premises
of
firearms
dealers
without
warrants.
both
the
criminal
code
and
the
internal
revenue
code
contain
a
multiplicity
of
regulations
governing
the
sale
and
distribution
of
firearms.
i
take
it
there
can
be
no
question
of
the
importance
of
close
regulation
of
the
gun
industry.
approximately
60%
of
the
murders
in
the
country
by
use
of
firearms
as
are
95%
of
the
killings
of
police
officers
on
duty.
the
power
of
congress
to
require
licenses
in
registration
and
to
tax
this
incidence
of
the
gun
industry
has
been
consistently
upheld.
that
power
is
not
questioned
in
this
case.
as
a
central
aspect
of
the
regulatory
scheme,
section
923
(g)
of
title
18
provides
for
inspection.
the
relevant
language
for
this
case
is
“the
secretary
may
enter
during
business
hours
the
premises
including
places
of
storage
of
any
firearms
or
ammunition
dealer
for
the
purpose
of
inspecting
any
firearms
or
ammunition
kept
or
stored
by
such
dealer
at
such
premises.”
the
clear
import
of
this
section
is
the
treasury
agents
need
not
have
a
warrant
to
inspect
and
that
licensed
dealers
have
a
duty
under
the
statute
to
permit
inspection.
this
section
is
virtually
identical
with
the
section
considered
by
this
court
in
colonnade
catering
corporation
versus
united
states.
in
colonnade,
this
court
held
with
three
dissents
that
congress
had
not
authorized
entry
by
physical
force
without
a
warrant.
the
significance
of
that
case
for
this
one
however,
is
in
the
court’s
reasoning.
the
court
acknowledged
that
treasury
agents
have
been
given
broad
authority
to
enter
and
inspect
the
premises
of
liquor
dealers
and
it
determined
that
this
authority
is
constitutional.
both
the
majority
and
the
dissenters
agree
that
the
rule
of
camara
versus
municipal
court
and
see
versus
city
of
seattle
was
inapplicable
to
that
case.
that
rule
of
course
is
the
one
that
requires
a
warrant
for
administrative
search
that
has
not
been
consented
to
but
as
i
have
said
all
justice,
all
of
the
justices
agreed
that
that
was
--
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
there
is
your
honor.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
for
all
relevant
purposes,
if
that
kind
of
search
is
--
or
inspection
is
sustainable
with
respect
to
liquor
industry
it
should
be
sustainable
with
respect
to
regulation
of
the
gun
industry.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
yes,
that
is
essentially
correct.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
well,
i
do
not
think
it
runs
the
other
day
because
that
amendment
is
not
been
interpreted
before
[voice
overlap].
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
that’s
right.
it
certainly
is
true
that
the
history
of
a
close
regulation
of
the
liquor
industry
is
a
much
older
one
than
close
regulation
of
the
gun
industry.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
has
been
pervasive.
there
were
--
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
yes,
your
honor.
there
were
old
statutes
before
the
constitution
was
adopted
that
prohibited
concealed
weapons
and
state
regulation
of
the
gun
industry
has
proceeded
in
this
century
and
there
were
federal
laws
on
the
book
as
early
as
1934.
so
when
you
say
recent,
it
isn’t
the
last
few
years
but
it
certainly
is.
it
isn’t
the
long
history
to
the
end.
the
history
isn’t
of
that
such
close
regulation
as
existed
with
respect
to
liquor
industry.
it
is
our
contention
however
that
reasonableness
under
the
fourth
amendment
in
this
context
in
determining
what
kinds
of
inspection
require
warrants
has
to
be
determined
with
the
view
toward
an
evolving
society
and
the
needs
of
the
society
at
this
time
and
we
do
not
see
how
it
can
be
said
that
despite
the
greater
history
of
regulation
of
the
liquor
industry
that
the
need
for
inspection
is
greater
in
regard
to
liquor
than
it
is
with
respect
to
lethal
weapons
and
so
are
--
and
i
think
that’s
borne
out
by
the
findings
of
congress
in
passing
the
most
recent
legislation
in
1968.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
as
i
understand
the
way
the
court
has
interpreted,
that
constitutional
protection.
it
essentially
relates
to
the
state’s
militia
and
i
would
think
that
it
does
not
foreclose
close
regulation
of
dealers
in
firearms
anymore
than
it
forecloses
the
forbidding
of
the
carrying
of
certain
or
possessing
a
certain
kinds
of
firearm.
so
essentially
it
is
our
contention
that
it
has
no
relevance.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
we
think
that
you
have
look
at
each
area
to
see
whether
the
test
of
camara
should
apply
to
the
test
of
colonnade.
we
do
not
think
the
fact
that
there
is
not
a
long
history
dating
back
to
the
time
of
the
constitution
of
inspections
without
warrants
is
determinative
but
it
might
well
be
that
the
securities
industry
would
be
different
from
the
gun
industry.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
well,
i
think
the
--
well,
maybe
it
would
be
useful
if
i
say
why
i
think
the
gun
industry
like
the
liquor
industry
is
appropriately
subject
to
this
kind
of
inspection.
first
of
all,
unlike
the
ordinary
homeowner
or
the
person
who
had
business
premises
in
a
sea,
this
is
not
a
citizen
who
is
just
subject
to
searches
that
happen
to
every
homeowner
or
every
owner
of
a
business
office.
this
is
someone
who’s
licensed
in
a
particular
industry
and
a
very
closely
regulated
industry
who
knows
who
the
authorities
are
that
have
power
to
inspect,
what
agency
it
is
that’s
regulating
the
gun
industry.
so
that
--
first
of
all,
when
an
agent
of
the
alcohol,
tobacco
and
firearms
unit
shows
up
at
his
premises
he
is
virtually
certain
that
there
is
proper
authority
in
that
officer
to
inspect
assuming
that
there
isn’t
a
problem
i
think
that
there
was
in
camara
or
in
see
that
somebody
might
show
up
in
the
--
the
homeowner
or
the
warehouse
owner
wouldn’t
know
whether
this
fellow
really
had
the
power
to
make
a
search.
secondly
and
i
supposed
this
is
quite
crucial,
this
is
not
like
an
ordinary
administrative
inspection.
if
there
is
a
fire
hazard,
faulty
wiring
or
defective
elevator
and
the
inspector
shows
up
and
says
i
want
to
check
your
wiring,
i
want
to
look
at
your
elevators,
if
entry
is
refused
it’s
unlikely
that
the
condition
is
going
to
be
corrected
within
three
or
four
hours
or
however
long
it
would
take
to
get
a
warrant.
if
the
condition
is
corrected,
the
substantial
purpose
of
the
administrative
regulation
is
achieved
since
the
substantial
purposes
to
correct
the
wiring
or
to
get
the
elevator
on
proper
working
order
and
that
just
isn’t
true
here
in
respect
to
these
inspections.
when
the
inspector
shows
up,
if
he
has
to
go
for
a
couple
of
hours
to
get
a
warrant,
a
gun
dealer
can
just
put
aside
whatever
weapons
may
be
illegal.
the
inspector
comes
back
with
his
warrant,
he
makes
the
inspection.
he
doesn’t
find
the
guns
and
then
the
gun
dealer
puts
the
weapons
back
in
their
place,
i
mean
the
entire
purpose
of
the
inspection
would
be
forwarded.
now,
well,
i
think
i‘ll
stop
there.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
it
is
essentially
similar
to
that,
yes.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
not
so
far
as
i
am
aware,
your
honor.
there
are
a
great
many
statutes
of
this
kind
and
i
did
inquire
about
some
of
them.
for
instance,
the
federal
aviation
agency
has
the
power
to
inspect
airports
and
so
on
and
i
gather
that
in
most
instances,
in
those
activities
that
there’s
fairly
close
cooperation
and
the
desire
not
to
upset
the
federal
agency
that
is
governing
until
the
searches
are
consented
to
as
a
matter
of
course.
that
seems
to
be
the
typical
experience.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
i
--
yes,
i
believe
so
copies
--
that
surely
appeared
in
the
record
that
copies
of
the
statute
were
mailed
to
biswell
and
that
agent
hupp
saw
on
his
desk
or
at
some
point
that
there
was
a
warrant
to
seize
the
rest
of
the
rifles
the
next
day
and
he
returned
to
the
pawnshop
at
that
point.
i
think
at
that
point,
he
saw
a
copy
of
the
regulations
that
certainly
biswell
have
been
notified
of
the
content
of
the
statute
and
had
received
the
regulations
indicating
both
what
the
substantive
regulations
were
and
the
power
of
the
agents
of
the
division
to
search
his
premises,
inspect
his
premises.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
he
did
make
a
claim
at
trial
that
he
subjectively
was
surprised
that
these
weapons
were
outlawed
but
they
have
been
outlawed
since
1934
and
in
fact,
although
we
believe
that
it
was
not
necessary
under
free
versus
united
states,
the
district
judge
gave
a
rather
favorable
instruction
which
i
think
the
juror
would
not
have
–-
under
which
i
think
a
juror
would
not
have
convicted
unless
he
believed
that
biswell
did
know
that
these
firearms
were
illegal
firearms
under
the
national
firearms
act.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
well,
we
think
the
clear
implication
of
colonnade
is
that
if
the
liquor
dealer
had
refused
entry,
he
could
appropriately
be
punished.
in
fact,
in
the
opinion
says
whether
the
imposition
of
a
fine
for
refusal
to
permit
entry
is
under
the
statutory
scheme,
the
exclusive
sanction
absent
to
warrant
to
break
and
enter.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
that’s
correct.
we
--
yes,
we
believe
that
the
--
there
is
general
line
--
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
that’s
correct.
and
under
colonnade
--
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
absolutely,
yes.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
well,
we
rely
on
that
and
that
--
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
not
as
consent
in
the
ordinary
sense.
now
i
say
in
the
ordinary
sense
because
there
is
a
qualification
that
i’d
like
to
make.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
i
am
certainly
not
making
the
argument
that
this
is
consented
in
the
ordinary
fourth
amendment
sense.
it
is
arguable
that
it
is
either
consent
in
the
sense
that
he
got
a
license
knowing
what
the
regulatory
scheme
was
and
since
it
was
reasonable,
he
sort
of
undertook
this
kind
of
obligation.
there
is
that
argument
and
there’s
also
an
argument
that
can
be
drawn
from
the
opinion
in
davis
versus
united
states
which
suggest
that
the
standard
of
consent
may
be
different
if
there
is
a
duty
to
admit
someone
or
in
that
case
it
was
public
property
rationing
stamps
that
were
involved.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
that’s
correct.
it
was
in
acquiescence
in
lawful
authority.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
absolutely.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
absolutely.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
it’s
a
critical
point,
the
fact
that
he
unlocked
the
warehouse
itself.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
well,
we
just
think
bumper
is
not
applicable.
bumper
is
an
ordinary
fourth
amendment
case,
the
kind
of
consent
that’s
involved.
there
is
a
free
voluntary
agreement
to
do
something
that
you
are
not
legally
required
to
do.
i
think,
i
mean
this
is
the
key
point
in
the
case.
can
congress
legally
require
the
licensed
firearm
dealer
to
open
up
his
storage
room?
if
it
can
legally
require
it
then
that
eliminates
the
problem
with
physical
entry
that
was
post
in
colonnade.
and
if
he
--
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
that’s
correct.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
that’s
why
we
argued
that
it’s
not
consent
in
the
ordinary
sense.
but
again
i
return
to
mr.
justice
douglas’
opinion
in
colonnade.
it
was
assumed
in
that
case
that
he
could
be
punished
for
refusing
to
open
the
storeroom
that
was
--
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
no,
it
was
assumed
that
it
couldn’t
--
well,
as
far
as
it
could,
i
would
say
yes
that
the
implication
of
the
opinion
is
that
congress
could
but
that
of
course
is
not
involved
here.
we
don’t
argue
that
congress
has
done
that.
assuming
that
--
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
yes,
i
think
one
could
make
an
argument
on
the
other
side
but
i
--
we
--
that
is
our
position,
the
924.
you
don’t
have
the
kind
of
specific
language
that
you
had
in
colonnade
about
refusal
to
enter
but
924
does
make
it
a
crime
to
violate
any
provision
of
this
chapter.
now,
we
believe
that
the
inspection
provision
gives
a
clear
right
to
the
agent
to
enter
and
therefore
if
that
entry
is
refused
then
that’s
a
violation
of
(voice
overlap).
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
that’s
correct
mr.
justice
stewart,
it
is.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
well,
you
do
not
have
the
specific
language
that
you
have
in
colonnade
but
we
think
that
that
really
is
surplusage
that
the
clear
implication
of
that
provision
is
that
the
agents
have
authority
to
enter
and
that
therefore
the
dealer
has
the
duty
to
allow
them
to
enter.
even
if
we
were
wrong
about
that
in
terms
of
whether
it’s
criminally
punishable
whether
924
spells
out
the
criminal
sanction
with
such
clarity
that
a
refusal
to
allow
entry
would
be
a
criminal
violation.
we
still
think
it’s
clear
that
the
import
of
the
statute
is
that
under
the
statute,
dealers
are
supposed
to
allow
entry
and
so
then
we
view
that
by
saying
that
you
have
a
duty
which
might
result
in
loss
of
license,
might
not
result
in
criminal
sanctions
but
nevertheless
a
duty
illegally
imposed
by
congress
so
that
once
you
do
allow
the
entry
that’s
an
acquiescence
and
a
lawful
duty
imposed
by
congress
and
that
makes
the
inspection
proper
and
that
the
fruits
of
the
inspection
therefore
admissible
in
evidence
in
the
criminal
trial.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
no,
i
would
say
it
is
a
necessary
part
of
our
argument
that
he
have
a
duty
that
he
--
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
and
that
the
implication
is
that
you
are
not
supposed
to
keep
the
store
room
locked
if
the
agents
want
to
enter,
yes.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
that
is
necessary.
but
the
criminal
sanction
is
not.
well,
i
deal
briefly
with
the
point
that
is
raised
in
the
amicus
brief
by
civil
liberties
union
if
the
inspection
was
lawful
we
think
it
is
clear
that
the
evidence
is
admissible
in
a
criminal
trial.
again,
going
back
to
colonnade,
that
evidence
presumably
would
have
been
admissible
in
a
criminal
trial.
the
evidence
was
suppressed
in
that
case.
there
were
criminal
sanctions
as
they
are
here
for
the
violation
of
the
regulations
in
colonnade
as
well
as
here
and
this
court
has
always
assumed
that
contraband
found
in
the
course
of
a
lawful
inspection
can
properly
be
introduced
in
evidence.
in
short,
in
summary,
it
is
our
position
that
colonnade
dictates
reversal
of
the
decision
below
unless
the
major
reasoning
of
that
opinion
is
to
be
repudiated
or
the
gun
industry
regulation
of
the
gun
industry
is
to
be
distinguished
from
regulation
of
the
liquor
industry
and
we
urge
very
strongly
that
in
light
of
present
social
conditions,
it
must
be
that
congress
has
as
much
power
over
the
gun
industry
in
these
terms
as
it
does
over
the
liquor
industry.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
just
very
briefly,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
we
don’t
expect
the
court
or
ask
the
court
in
this
case
to
uphold
the
inspection
provisions
of
every
federal
statute
that
provides
for
inspection
without
a
warrant.
we
do
think
that
there
may
be
differences
and
their
differences
in
the
practices
now,
for
instance,
i
am
told
that
in
regard
during
inspections
of
food,
that
there’s
never
been
any
problem
because
they
would
simply
stop
inspecting
the
food
if
the
inspections
weren’t
permitted
and
then
i
suppose
the
food
will
be
harder
to
sell.
the
fda
has
informs
people
that
they
have
a
right
not
to
consent
to
a
search
without
a
warrant
and
goes
out
and
gets
warrants.
it’s
acting
in
accord
with
the
holding
of
camara
and
see,
and
the
considerations
there
may
be
quite
different
and
they
are
in
the
gun
industry.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
i’m
not
sure.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
i’m
not
--
its
footnote
5
on
page
10
but
i
am
not
sure
precisely
which
statute
he’s
referring
to.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
it
seems
to
be
title
29,
section
657.
i
am
not
sure
whether
that
is
in
this
footnote
or
not.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
i
am
not
sure
whether
that’s
an
accurate
statement
of
the
statute.
in
any
event,
we
think
that
the
relevant
factors
are
whether
somebody
has
knowingly
undertaken
an
obligation
as
a
licensee,
the
reasonableness
of
the
regulation
whether
there’s
a
narrow
and
falsely
regulated
industry
so
that
the
authority
of
the
inspector
is
known
and
the
person
knows
the
area
to
be
inspected,
how
great
the
invasion
of
privacy
is
here
--
reached
on
the
business
premises
and
whether
there
is
a
need
for
surprise
as
there
are
--
as
there
is
this
case.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
i
think
mr.
justice
marshall
he
is
effectively
on
notice
of
that
and
i
presume
that
is
why
he
was
hesitant
to
consent
to
the
inspection
in
this
case.
he
certainly
must
have
feared
that.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
there’s
nothing.
there’s
not
a
specific
language
to
that
effect.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
the
only
line
--
there
is
no
language
to
that
effect
but
there
are
very
substantial
criminal
penalties
for
a
variety
of
acts
and
there
is
a
provision
that
the
secretary
can
enter
the
premises
during
business
hours
to
inspect.
now,
i
would
think
that
an
ordinary,
reasonable
businessman
would
know
that
if
criminal
violation
is
found
during
an
inspection
he
is
in
serious
trouble
and
maybe
prosecutor
and
that
the
agent,
he
is
going
to
testify
as
to
what
he
found
in
the
inspection
and
is
going
to
produce
any
contraband
that
was
seized
at
that
point.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
well,
i
would
move
it
backwards
and
say
if
they
can
be
seized,
they
can
be
introduced
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
yes,
it
would
be
noble
rule
to
say
that
the
contraband
which
is
properly
seized
cannot
be
introduced
in
the
prosecution.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
well
the
aclu
accepts
that
rule
in
its
amicus
brief.
it
says
you
can
seize
them
because
they
are
contraband
but
because
of
the
self
protection
and
of
course
you
can’t
admit
them
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
that
as
far
as
i
know
is
without
support
of
any
opinion
that’s
been
written
on
the
court
in
the
majority
or
in
the
dissent.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
well,
i
would
think
you’d
run
into
the
same
problem
there.
why
should
you
be
able
to
use
it
to
revoke
a
license
if
you
can’t
use
it
in
a
criminal
prosecution?
so
again
i
would
think
the
logic
of
the
court’s
fourth
amendment
rulings
is
that
if
–-
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
well,
first
of
all
that
would
be
inconsistent
with
anything
this
court
has
ever
said
about
the
fourth
amendment.
and
there
are
--
the
zap
case
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
is
an
example
of
inspection
without
a
warrant.
they
are
consented
to
by
contract
and
in
which
it
was
introduced
in
the
criminal
trial
and
that’s
been
the
assumption
of
every
holding.
practically,
the
result
of
the
rule,
that
kind
of
rule
in
this
area
would
be
to
require
the
government
to
get
warrants,
i
think
it
would
--
since
these
are
very
serious
violations
of
the
criminal
law
in
most
of
the
weapons
that
are
forbidden
under
the
national
firearms
act
for
the
things
like
machine
guns
and
bombs
and
hand
grenade.
in
addition,
the
sort
of
rifles
and
shot
guns
and
if
the
government
upon
finding
that
could
not
be
used
as
evidence
in
a
criminal
trial,
it
would
certainly
defeat
the
purpose
of
the
inspection.
i
might
--
just
one
point
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
marshall’s
point
that
colonnade
statute
did
not
contain
any
language
of
the
client
that
you
suggested
either
and
so
i
again
would
say
this
case
is
governed
by
colonnade
on
that.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
on
review
of
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
that
an
agent
of
the
alcohol,
tobacco,
and
firearms
division
of
the
treasury
department
searched
respondent
biswell’s
business
premises
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
the
issue
involved
is
a
narrow
one.
whether
congress
in
regulating
the
distribution
of
firearms,
may
authorize
treasury
agents
to
make
routine
inspections
during
business
hours
of
the
business
premises
of
licensed
dealers
in
firearms
and
whether
congress
may
impost
upon
these
licensed
dealers
a
duty
to
admit
the
agents
even
though
the
agents
do
not
possess
a
warrant.
putting
the
question
somewhat
differently,
thus
the
congressional
authorization
of
such
inspections
and
the
imposition
of
a
duty
upon
licensed
dealers
to
admit
the
agents
without
warrants
conflict
with
the
fourth
amendment.
we
believe
the
constitutionality
of
the
authorization
and
the
duty
congress
has
imposed
is
plain
under
colonnade
catering
corporation
versus
united
states
and
that
therefore
the
court
below
erred.
the
relevant
facts
in
this
case
are
quite
straight
forward.
loarn
anthony
biswell
is
a
pawnbroker
in
hobbs,
new
mexico.
a
substantial
number
of
the
items
pawned
with
him
as
security
for
loans
are
firearms.
at
the
time
of
the
inspection
here
he
held
some
444
firearms.
biswell
was
a
licensed
dealer
of
firearms.
under
section
923
of
title
18,
dealers
and
firearms
must
be
licensed
and
dealers
who
are
explicitly
defined
to
include
pawnbrokers.
special
investigator
hupp
of
the
alcohol,
tobacco
and
firearms
division
made
a
routine
compliance
visit
to
biswell’s
pawnshop.
according
to
hupp,
such
visits
of
dealers
are
made
about
once
a
year.
hupp
identified
himself
and
first
inquired
about
biswell’s
records.
he
ascertained
that
biswell
was
not
keeping
records
in
the
form
required
of
all
firearms
dealers.
hupp
then
indicated
that
he
wish
to
see
the
storerooms
where
the
firearms
were
kept.
biswell
kept
these
along
with
other
pawned
items
in
a
locked
storage
room.
biswell
inquired
if
hupp
got
a
search
warrant
and
hupp
said
no
but
he
showed
biswell
a
copy
of
the
statute
authorizing
treasury
agents
to
search
the
business
premises
of
firearms
dealers
without
warrants.
at
that
point,
biswell
said,
well,
that’s
what
it
says
so
i
guess
it
is
okay
and
he
unlocked
the
storeroom.
inside
the
storeroom,
hupp
saw
a
rifle
with
an
11
and
3
quarter
inch
barrel.
any
rifle
with
a
barrel
of
less
than
16
inches
is
an
illegal
firearm
under
the
national
firearms
act
of
1968.
that
act
does
not
absolutely
forbid
possession
of
such
firearms
but
sharply
constricts
a
rightful
possession
and
commerce
in
such
firearms.
each
set
of
firearm
must
have
serial
number,
each
dealer
in
such
firearms
must
pay
a
special
occupational
tax
and
be
specially
registered
with
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
whenever
any
such
firearm
is
transferred,
the
transferor
must
pay
a
$200.00
transfer
tax
and
obtain
approval
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury.
it
was
clear
to
agent
hupp
that
biswell
did
not
legally
possess
the
sort
of
rifle
he
saw.
there
was
no
required
serial
number
on
the
rifle.
biswell
indicated
that
he
had
no
idea
such
weapons
had
to
be
specially
registered.
finally,
it
was
obvious
that
no
owner
would
pay
transfer
tax
of
$200.00
to
get
a
$3.00
loan
although
of
course
hupp
didn’t
know
the
amount
of
the
loan
but
he
knew
it
was
much
less
than
$200.00
from
a
pawnbroker.
soon
after
seeing
this
rifle,
hupp
noticed
another
with
a
short
barrel
and
he
seize
both
rifles.
the
district
judge
denied
a
motion
to
suppress
the
two
sort
of
rifles
and
they
were
introduced
at
biswell’s
trial.
they
in
the
observations
of
them
by
agent
hupp
irrelevant
to
the
count
for
which
biswell
was
convicted,
engaging
as
a
dealer
on
illegal
firearms
without
having
paid
this
special
occupational
tax.
among
other
claims
on
appeal,
biswell
asserted
that
the
search
leading
to
the
seizure
of
the
rifles
was
unconstitutional.
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
that
the
search
was
unconstitutional
and
that
the
evidence
should’ve
been
suppressed
and
it
reversed
the
conviction.
i
think
it
may
be
useful
that
the
outset
to
put
aside
what
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
there
is
no
assertion
by
biswell
that
hupp
performed
other
than
routine
actions
under
the
statute.
it
is
not
disputed
that
he
was
engaged
in
the
periodic
compliance
visit.
it
is
not
disputed
that
such
visits
typically
involved
inspection
of
the
firearms
on
the
premises
and
if
the
entry
into
the
storeroom
was
valid,
the
appropriateness
of
the
seizure
of
the
two
clearly
contraband
weapons
is
not
challenged.
at
the
same
time
it
is
clear
that
biswell
unlocked
the
door
of
the
storeroom
because
he
acquiesced
in
an
apparent
show
of
the
lawful
authority.
in
an
ordinary
criminal
investigation,
his
action
would
not
of
constituted
consent
to
an
otherwise
unauthorize
search.
thus,
we
do
not
argue
that
this
search
was
consented
to
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
consent.
the
case
thus
presents
very
clearly,
the
power
of
congress
to
authorize
treasury
agents
responsible
for
enforcement
of
the
firearms
laws
to
authorize
those
agents
to
inspect
the
business
premises
of
firearms
dealers
without
warrants.
both
the
criminal
code
and
the
internal
revenue
code
contain
a
multiplicity
of
regulations
governing
the
sale
and
distribution
of
firearms.
i
take
it
there
can
be
no
question
of
the
importance
of
close
regulation
of
the
gun
industry.
approximately
60%
of
the
murders
in
the
country
by
use
of
firearms
as
are
95%
of
the
killings
of
police
officers
on
duty.
the
power
of
congress
to
require
licenses
in
registration
and
to
tax
this
incidence
of
the
gun
industry
has
been
consistently
upheld.
that
power
is
not
questioned
in
this
case.
as
a
central
aspect
of
the
regulatory
scheme,
section
923
(g)
of
title
18
provides
for
inspection.
the
relevant
language
for
this
case
is
“the
secretary
may
enter
during
business
hours
the
premises
including
places
of
storage
of
any
firearms
or
ammunition
dealer
for
the
purpose
of
inspecting
any
firearms
or
ammunition
kept
or
stored
by
such
dealer
at
such
premises.”
the
clear
import
of
this
section
is
the
treasury
agents
need
not
have
a
warrant
to
inspect
and
that
licensed
dealers
have
a
duty
under
the
statute
to
permit
inspection.
this
section
is
virtually
identical
with
the
section
considered
by
this
court
in
colonnade
catering
corporation
versus
united
states.
in
colonnade,
this
court
held
with
three
dissents
that
congress
had
not
authorized
entry
by
physical
force
without
a
warrant.
the
significance
of
that
case
for
this
one
however,
is
in
the
court’s
reasoning.
the
court
acknowledged
that
treasury
agents
have
been
given
broad
authority
to
enter
and
inspect
the
premises
of
liquor
dealers
and
it
determined
that
this
authority
is
constitutional.
both
the
majority
and
the
dissenters
agree
that
the
rule
of
camara
versus
municipal
court
and
see
versus
city
of
seattle
was
inapplicable
to
that
case.
that
rule
of
course
is
the
one
that
requires
a
warrant
for
administrative
search
that
has
not
been
consented
to
but
as
i
have
said
all
justice,
all
of
the
justices
agreed
that
that
was
--
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
there
is
your
honor.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
for
all
relevant
purposes,
if
that
kind
of
search
is
--
or
inspection
is
sustainable
with
respect
to
liquor
industry
it
should
be
sustainable
with
respect
to
regulation
of
the
gun
industry.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
yes,
that
is
essentially
correct.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
well,
i
do
not
think
it
runs
the
other
day
because
that
amendment
is
not
been
interpreted
before
[voice
overlap].
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
that’s
right.
it
certainly
is
true
that
the
history
of
a
close
regulation
of
the
liquor
industry
is
a
much
older
one
than
close
regulation
of
the
gun
industry.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
has
been
pervasive.
there
were
--
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
yes,
your
honor.
there
were
old
statutes
before
the
constitution
was
adopted
that
prohibited
concealed
weapons
and
state
regulation
of
the
gun
industry
has
proceeded
in
this
century
and
there
were
federal
laws
on
the
book
as
early
as
1934.
so
when
you
say
recent,
it
isn’t
the
last
few
years
but
it
certainly
is.
it
isn’t
the
long
history
to
the
end.
the
history
isn’t
of
that
such
close
regulation
as
existed
with
respect
to
liquor
industry.
it
is
our
contention
however
that
reasonableness
under
the
fourth
amendment
in
this
context
in
determining
what
kinds
of
inspection
require
warrants
has
to
be
determined
with
the
view
toward
an
evolving
society
and
the
needs
of
the
society
at
this
time
and
we
do
not
see
how
it
can
be
said
that
despite
the
greater
history
of
regulation
of
the
liquor
industry
that
the
need
for
inspection
is
greater
in
regard
to
liquor
than
it
is
with
respect
to
lethal
weapons
and
so
are
--
and
i
think
that’s
borne
out
by
the
findings
of
congress
in
passing
the
most
recent
legislation
in
1968.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
as
i
understand
the
way
the
court
has
interpreted,
that
constitutional
protection.
it
essentially
relates
to
the
state’s
militia
and
i
would
think
that
it
does
not
foreclose
close
regulation
of
dealers
in
firearms
anymore
than
it
forecloses
the
forbidding
of
the
carrying
of
certain
or
possessing
a
certain
kinds
of
firearm.
so
essentially
it
is
our
contention
that
it
has
no
relevance.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
we
think
that
you
have
look
at
each
area
to
see
whether
the
test
of
camara
should
apply
to
the
test
of
colonnade.
we
do
not
think
the
fact
that
there
is
not
a
long
history
dating
back
to
the
time
of
the
constitution
of
inspections
without
warrants
is
determinative
but
it
might
well
be
that
the
securities
industry
would
be
different
from
the
gun
industry.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
well,
i
think
the
--
well,
maybe
it
would
be
useful
if
i
say
why
i
think
the
gun
industry
like
the
liquor
industry
is
appropriately
subject
to
this
kind
of
inspection.
first
of
all,
unlike
the
ordinary
homeowner
or
the
person
who
had
business
premises
in
a
sea,
this
is
not
a
citizen
who
is
just
subject
to
searches
that
happen
to
every
homeowner
or
every
owner
of
a
business
office.
this
is
someone
who’s
licensed
in
a
particular
industry
and
a
very
closely
regulated
industry
who
knows
who
the
authorities
are
that
have
power
to
inspect,
what
agency
it
is
that’s
regulating
the
gun
industry.
so
that
--
first
of
all,
when
an
agent
of
the
alcohol,
tobacco
and
firearms
unit
shows
up
at
his
premises
he
is
virtually
certain
that
there
is
proper
authority
in
that
officer
to
inspect
assuming
that
there
isn’t
a
problem
i
think
that
there
was
in
camara
or
in
see
that
somebody
might
show
up
in
the
--
the
homeowner
or
the
warehouse
owner
wouldn’t
know
whether
this
fellow
really
had
the
power
to
make
a
search.
secondly
and
i
supposed
this
is
quite
crucial,
this
is
not
like
an
ordinary
administrative
inspection.
if
there
is
a
fire
hazard,
faulty
wiring
or
defective
elevator
and
the
inspector
shows
up
and
says
i
want
to
check
your
wiring,
i
want
to
look
at
your
elevators,
if
entry
is
refused
it’s
unlikely
that
the
condition
is
going
to
be
corrected
within
three
or
four
hours
or
however
long
it
would
take
to
get
a
warrant.
if
the
condition
is
corrected,
the
substantial
purpose
of
the
administrative
regulation
is
achieved
since
the
substantial
purposes
to
correct
the
wiring
or
to
get
the
elevator
on
proper
working
order
and
that
just
isn’t
true
here
in
respect
to
these
inspections.
when
the
inspector
shows
up,
if
he
has
to
go
for
a
couple
of
hours
to
get
a
warrant,
a
gun
dealer
can
just
put
aside
whatever
weapons
may
be
illegal.
the
inspector
comes
back
with
his
warrant,
he
makes
the
inspection.
he
doesn’t
find
the
guns
and
then
the
gun
dealer
puts
the
weapons
back
in
their
place,
i
mean
the
entire
purpose
of
the
inspection
would
be
forwarded.
now,
well,
i
think
i‘ll
stop
there.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
it
is
essentially
similar
to
that,
yes.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
not
so
far
as
i
am
aware,
your
honor.
there
are
a
great
many
statutes
of
this
kind
and
i
did
inquire
about
some
of
them.
for
instance,
the
federal
aviation
agency
has
the
power
to
inspect
airports
and
so
on
and
i
gather
that
in
most
instances,
in
those
activities
that
there’s
fairly
close
cooperation
and
the
desire
not
to
upset
the
federal
agency
that
is
governing
until
the
searches
are
consented
to
as
a
matter
of
course.
that
seems
to
be
the
typical
experience.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
i
--
yes,
i
believe
so
copies
--
that
surely
appeared
in
the
record
that
copies
of
the
statute
were
mailed
to
biswell
and
that
agent
hupp
saw
on
his
desk
or
at
some
point
that
there
was
a
warrant
to
seize
the
rest
of
the
rifles
the
next
day
and
he
returned
to
the
pawnshop
at
that
point.
i
think
at
that
point,
he
saw
a
copy
of
the
regulations
that
certainly
biswell
have
been
notified
of
the
content
of
the
statute
and
had
received
the
regulations
indicating
both
what
the
substantive
regulations
were
and
the
power
of
the
agents
of
the
division
to
search
his
premises,
inspect
his
premises.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
he
did
make
a
claim
at
trial
that
he
subjectively
was
surprised
that
these
weapons
were
outlawed
but
they
have
been
outlawed
since
1934
and
in
fact,
although
we
believe
that
it
was
not
necessary
under
free
versus
united
states,
the
district
judge
gave
a
rather
favorable
instruction
which
i
think
the
juror
would
not
have
–-
under
which
i
think
a
juror
would
not
have
convicted
unless
he
believed
that
biswell
did
know
that
these
firearms
were
illegal
firearms
under
the
national
firearms
act.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
well,
we
think
the
clear
implication
of
colonnade
is
that
if
the
liquor
dealer
had
refused
entry,
he
could
appropriately
be
punished.
in
fact,
in
the
opinion
says
whether
the
imposition
of
a
fine
for
refusal
to
permit
entry
is
under
the
statutory
scheme,
the
exclusive
sanction
absent
to
warrant
to
break
and
enter.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
that’s
correct.
we
--
yes,
we
believe
that
the
--
there
is
general
line
--
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
that’s
correct.
and
under
colonnade
--
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
absolutely,
yes.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
well,
we
rely
on
that
and
that
--
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
not
as
consent
in
the
ordinary
sense.
now
i
say
in
the
ordinary
sense
because
there
is
a
qualification
that
i’d
like
to
make.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
i
am
certainly
not
making
the
argument
that
this
is
consented
in
the
ordinary
fourth
amendment
sense.
it
is
arguable
that
it
is
either
consent
in
the
sense
that
he
got
a
license
knowing
what
the
regulatory
scheme
was
and
since
it
was
reasonable,
he
sort
of
undertook
this
kind
of
obligation.
there
is
that
argument
and
there’s
also
an
argument
that
can
be
drawn
from
the
opinion
in
davis
versus
united
states
which
suggest
that
the
standard
of
consent
may
be
different
if
there
is
a
duty
to
admit
someone
or
in
that
case
it
was
public
property
rationing
stamps
that
were
involved.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
that’s
correct.
it
was
in
acquiescence
in
lawful
authority.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
absolutely.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
absolutely.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
it’s
a
critical
point,
the
fact
that
he
unlocked
the
warehouse
itself.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
well,
we
just
think
bumper
is
not
applicable.
bumper
is
an
ordinary
fourth
amendment
case,
the
kind
of
consent
that’s
involved.
there
is
a
free
voluntary
agreement
to
do
something
that
you
are
not
legally
required
to
do.
i
think,
i
mean
this
is
the
key
point
in
the
case.
can
congress
legally
require
the
licensed
firearm
dealer
to
open
up
his
storage
room?
if
it
can
legally
require
it
then
that
eliminates
the
problem
with
physical
entry
that
was
post
in
colonnade.
and
if
he
--
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
that’s
correct.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
that’s
why
we
argued
that
it’s
not
consent
in
the
ordinary
sense.
but
again
i
return
to
mr.
justice
douglas’
opinion
in
colonnade.
it
was
assumed
in
that
case
that
he
could
be
punished
for
refusing
to
open
the
storeroom
that
was
--
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
no,
it
was
assumed
that
it
couldn’t
--
well,
as
far
as
it
could,
i
would
say
yes
that
the
implication
of
the
opinion
is
that
congress
could
but
that
of
course
is
not
involved
here.
we
don’t
argue
that
congress
has
done
that.
assuming
that
--
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
yes,
i
think
one
could
make
an
argument
on
the
other
side
but
i
--
we
--
that
is
our
position,
the
924.
you
don’t
have
the
kind
of
specific
language
that
you
had
in
colonnade
about
refusal
to
enter
but
924
does
make
it
a
crime
to
violate
any
provision
of
this
chapter.
now,
we
believe
that
the
inspection
provision
gives
a
clear
right
to
the
agent
to
enter
and
therefore
if
that
entry
is
refused
then
that’s
a
violation
of
(voice
overlap).
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
that’s
correct
mr.
justice
stewart,
it
is.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
well,
you
do
not
have
the
specific
language
that
you
have
in
colonnade
but
we
think
that
that
really
is
surplusage
that
the
clear
implication
of
that
provision
is
that
the
agents
have
authority
to
enter
and
that
therefore
the
dealer
has
the
duty
to
allow
them
to
enter.
even
if
we
were
wrong
about
that
in
terms
of
whether
it’s
criminally
punishable
whether
924
spells
out
the
criminal
sanction
with
such
clarity
that
a
refusal
to
allow
entry
would
be
a
criminal
violation.
we
still
think
it’s
clear
that
the
import
of
the
statute
is
that
under
the
statute,
dealers
are
supposed
to
allow
entry
and
so
then
we
view
that
by
saying
that
you
have
a
duty
which
might
result
in
loss
of
license,
might
not
result
in
criminal
sanctions
but
nevertheless
a
duty
illegally
imposed
by
congress
so
that
once
you
do
allow
the
entry
that’s
an
acquiescence
and
a
lawful
duty
imposed
by
congress
and
that
makes
the
inspection
proper
and
that
the
fruits
of
the
inspection
therefore
admissible
in
evidence
in
the
criminal
trial.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
no,
i
would
say
it
is
a
necessary
part
of
our
argument
that
he
have
a
duty
that
he
--
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
and
that
the
implication
is
that
you
are
not
supposed
to
keep
the
store
room
locked
if
the
agents
want
to
enter,
yes.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
that
is
necessary.
but
the
criminal
sanction
is
not.
well,
i
deal
briefly
with
the
point
that
is
raised
in
the
amicus
brief
by
civil
liberties
union
if
the
inspection
was
lawful
we
think
it
is
clear
that
the
evidence
is
admissible
in
a
criminal
trial.
again,
going
back
to
colonnade,
that
evidence
presumably
would
have
been
admissible
in
a
criminal
trial.
the
evidence
was
suppressed
in
that
case.
there
were
criminal
sanctions
as
they
are
here
for
the
violation
of
the
regulations
in
colonnade
as
well
as
here
and
this
court
has
always
assumed
that
contraband
found
in
the
course
of
a
lawful
inspection
can
properly
be
introduced
in
evidence.
in
short,
in
summary,
it
is
our
position
that
colonnade
dictates
reversal
of
the
decision
below
unless
the
major
reasoning
of
that
opinion
is
to
be
repudiated
or
the
gun
industry
regulation
of
the
gun
industry
is
to
be
distinguished
from
regulation
of
the
liquor
industry
and
we
urge
very
strongly
that
in
light
of
present
social
conditions,
it
must
be
that
congress
has
as
much
power
over
the
gun
industry
in
these
terms
as
it
does
over
the
liquor
industry.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
just
very
briefly,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
we
don’t
expect
the
court
or
ask
the
court
in
this
case
to
uphold
the
inspection
provisions
of
every
federal
statute
that
provides
for
inspection
without
a
warrant.
we
do
think
that
there
may
be
differences
and
their
differences
in
the
practices
now,
for
instance,
i
am
told
that
in
regard
during
inspections
of
food,
that
there’s
never
been
any
problem
because
they
would
simply
stop
inspecting
the
food
if
the
inspections
weren’t
permitted
and
then
i
suppose
the
food
will
be
harder
to
sell.
the
fda
has
informs
people
that
they
have
a
right
not
to
consent
to
a
search
without
a
warrant
and
goes
out
and
gets
warrants.
it’s
acting
in
accord
with
the
holding
of
camara
and
see,
and
the
considerations
there
may
be
quite
different
and
they
are
in
the
gun
industry.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
i’m
not
sure.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
i’m
not

but
i
am
not
sure
precisely
which
statute
he’s
referring
to.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
it
seems
to
be
title
29,
section
657.
i
am
not
sure
whether
that
is
in
this
footnote
or
not.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
i
am
not
sure
whether
that’s
an
accurate
statement
of
the
statute.
in
any
event,
we
think
that
the
relevant
factors
are
whether
somebody
has
knowingly
undertaken
an
obligation
as
a
licensee,
the
reasonableness
of
the
regulation
whether
there’s
a
narrow
and
falsely
regulated
industry
so
that
the
authority
of
the
inspector
is
known
and
the
person
knows
the
area
to
be
inspected,
how
great
the
invasion
of
privacy
is
here
--
reached
on
the
business
premises
and
whether
there
is
a
need
for
surprise
as
there
are
--
as
there
is
this
case.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
i
think
mr.
justice
marshall
he
is
effectively
on
notice
of
that
and
i
presume
that
is
why
he
was
hesitant
to
consent
to
the
inspection
in
this
case.
he
certainly
must
have
feared
that.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
there’s
nothing.
there’s
not
a
specific
language
to
that
effect.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
the
only
line
--
there
is
no
language
to
that
effect
but
there
are
very
substantial
criminal
penalties
for
a
variety
of
acts
and
there
is
a
provision
that
the
secretary
can
enter
the
premises
during
business
hours
to
inspect.
now,
i
would
think
that
an
ordinary,
reasonable
businessman
would
know
that
if
criminal
violation
is
found
during
an
inspection
he
is
in
serious
trouble
and
maybe
prosecutor
and
that
the
agent,
he
is
going
to
testify
as
to
what
he
found
in
the
inspection
and
is
going
to
produce
any
contraband
that
was
seized
at
that
point.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
well,
i
would
move
it
backwards
and
say
if
they
can
be
seized,
they
can
be
introduced
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
yes,
it
would
be
noble
rule
to
say
that
the
contraband
which
is
properly
seized
cannot
be
introduced
in
the
prosecution.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
well
the
aclu
accepts
that
rule
in
its
amicus
brief.
it
says
you
can
seize
them
because
they
are
contraband
but
because
of
the
self
protection
and
of
course
you
can’t
admit
them
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
that
as
far
as
i
know
is
without
support
of
any
opinion
that’s
been
written
on
the
court
in
the
majority
or
in
the
dissent.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
well,
i
would
think
you’d
run
into
the
same
problem
there.
why
should
you
be
able
to
use
it
to
revoke
a
license
if
you
can’t
use
it
in
a
criminal
prosecution?
so
again
i
would
think
the
logic
of
the
court’s
fourth
amendment
rulings
is
that
if
–-
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
well,
first
of
all
that
would
be
inconsistent
with
anything
this
court
has
ever
said
about
the
fourth
amendment.
and
there
are
--
the
zap
case
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
is
an
example
of
inspection
without
a
warrant.
they
are
consented
to
by
contract
and
in
which
it
was
introduced
in
the
criminal
trial
and
that’s
been
the
assumption
of
every
holding.
practically,
the
result
of
the
rule,
that
kind
of
rule
in
this
area
would
be
to
require
the
government
to
get
warrants,
i
think
it
would
--
since
these
are
very
serious
violations
of
the
criminal
law
in
most
of
the
weapons
that
are
forbidden
under
the
national
firearms
act
for
the
things
like
machine
guns
and
bombs
and
hand
grenade.
in
addition,
the
sort
of
rifles
and
shot
guns
and
if
the
government
upon
finding
that
could
not
be
used
as
evidence
in
a
criminal
trial,
it
would
certainly
defeat
the
purpose
of
the
inspection.
i
might
--
just
one
point
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
marshall’s
point
that
colonnade
statute
did
not
contain
any
language
of
the
client
that
you
suggested
either
and
so
i
again
would
say
this
case
is
governed
by
colonnade
on
that.
