unknown

historically,
historically,
certainly
my
brother
marshall
is
correct
that
the
government
regulation
of
this
production
sale
and
distribution
of
alcoholic
spirits
has
been
pervasive
in
almost
the
beginnings
and
through
the
history
of
the
eighteenth
amendment,
the
twenty-first
amendment
but
it
--
long
before
that.
by
contrast
with
firearms
which
have
not
been
regulated
until
the
very
rule,
the
recent
day,
isn’t
that
correct?
it
can
either
by
to
the
states
or
the
nation?
you
know
the
--
unknown
speaker
and
indeed
you
have
a
constitutional
amendment,
one
of
the
bills
of
rights
relating
to
firearms
which
runs
the
other
way.
unknown
speaker
i
know
it
has
but
there’s
nothing
comparable
with
respect
to
alcoholic
spirits.
unknown
speaker
it’s
been
pervasive
throughout
our
heads.
unknown
speaker
taxes,
regulations,
everything
else
by
contrast
with
firearms?
unknown
speaker
mr.
greenawalt,
factually
there
was
reference
and
you
made
it
to
the
fact
that
this
man
said,
well
if
that’s
the
law
then
of
course
come
in.
in
the
licensing
process
itself
when
one
obtains
the
license
of
this
kind
is
he
given
a
copy
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
so
it’s
your
position
there
wasn’t
any
surprise
on
his
part
with
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
mr.
greenawalt,
if
biswell
had
refused
entry
to
the
locked
vault
what
-
then
would
--
have
been
the
position?
unknown
speaker
yes,
(voice
overlap)
but
in
a
different
offense
than
the
one
that
which
he
was
convicted
here?
unknown
speaker
and
hupp
could
not
have
been
broken
it?
unknown
speaker
if
he
had
broken
in
and
seized
then
colonnade
would
have
made
it
illegal.
unknown
speaker
but
you
do
rely
on,
if
that
is
the
law,
i
guess
it’s
alright.
unknown
speaker
as
what?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
that
mr.
justice
clark’s
opinion
below
says
that
the
government
argued
in
that
court
the
appellant
consented.
you’re
not
making
that
argument
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
greenawalt,
it
is
consent
in
the
sense
that
it
served
to
negative
the
use
of
force.
unknown
speaker
and
that’s
the
--
the
what
--
that
that’s
--
what
gets
you
around
colonnade?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
if
he
hadn’t
have
acquiesced,
you
would’ve
been
having
some
problem?
unknown
speaker
so
it
is
a
critical
point?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
do
with
justice
clark’s
disposition
of
it
on
bumper?
unknown
speaker
well,
you’re
saying
can
congress
give
the
dealer
a
choice
between
going
to
jail
and
letting
people
in.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
you
say
to
him
either
you
let
us
in
or
you
will
go
to
jail?
but
you
have
your
choice
you
can
go
to
jail
if
you
don’t
want
to
let
us
in
and
we
can’t
break
it.
unknown
speaker
but
we
could
also
assume
in
that
case
if
congress
could
even
authorize
the
agent
to
break-in?
unknown
speaker
is
it
clear
to
you
that
--
if
he’d
said
yes
i
read
the
law
here
that
you
are
showing
me
but
i
am
not
going
to
let
you
in
that
he
would’ve
been
guilty
of
a
criminal
violation
then
and
there?
unknown
speaker
what’s
this
new
act,
directed
to
pollution?
unknown
speaker
is
that
in
your
brief?
that
--
the
reference
to
that
statute?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
mean,
it’s
a
safe
place
to
work
concept?
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
if
there
are
defects
unrepaired,
broken
stairways
and
things
like
that?
unknown
speaker
what
is
their
testimonial
about
finding
improper
doing?
unknown
speaker
of
course
the
guns
are
evidence
against
him?
unknown
speaker
but
how
do
you
get
to
put,
how
does
that
become
testimonial?
that’s
what
we
do
with
distinction
in
schmerber
in
that
line
of
cases
between
testimonial
and
non-testimonial?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don’t
understand
this.
we’ve
said
that
handwriting,
exemplars
fingerprints.
things
of
that
nature
are
not
testimonial
and
therefore
not
involved
with
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
now,
i
don’t
quite
understand
how
this
is?
unknown
speaker
you’re
relying
i
gather
on
mr.
justice
black’s
view
that
he
expressed
in
mapp
against
ohio
and
without
his
view,
mapp
against
ohio
could
not
and
would
have
been
decided
the
way
it
was.
unknown
speaker
so
you’re
saying
every
illegal
search
is
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment
law
of
the
court?
unknown
speaker
if
at
least,
if
it
turns
up
something
that
tends
to
prove
a
criminal
violation
by
the
owner
of
the
premises
that
is
introduced
against
him?
unknown
speaker
what
the
--
do
you
have
the
citations
of
the
statute
which
probably
mentions
the
more
recent
statute,
the
more
general
one?
is
that
in
the
briefs
anywhere?
unknown
speaker
you
said
it
was
in
your
brief
and
in
roman
3
of
your
brief,
two
and
three
they’re
all
--
three
or
four
dozens,
that’s
a
choice
i
take,
which
is
it?
unknown
speaker
this
one
purportedly
authorizes
--
excuse
me.
as
long
as
the
citation
is
there,
i
take
is
somewhat
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
29
-
657
that
is
one
that
purports
to
authorize
inspection
of
any
employer
engaged
in
commerce.
unknown
speaker
mr.
greenawalt,
if
these
guns
were
inadmissible
in
evidence
in
the
criminal
prosecution
under
our
cases,
would
it
also
follow
if
they
could
not
have
been
seized
at
that
time?
unknown
speaker
what
if
it
were
held
that
they
couldn’t
be
introduced
in
a
criminal
prosecution
but
you
nevertheless
permit
their
seizure?
unknown
speaker
and
how
about
if
you
couldn’t
seize
them
either,
could
you
use
the
--
could
you
use
what
you
saw
as
a
basis
for
revoking
a
license?
unknown
speaker
you
don’t
think
really
you
could
distinguish
between
permitting
a
search
for
the
purpose
of
enforcing
the
obligations
of
a
licensee
and
yet
not
permitting
the
evidence
to
be
used
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
