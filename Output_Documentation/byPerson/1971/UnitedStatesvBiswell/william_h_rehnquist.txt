mr.
greenawalt,
supposing
these
were
the
securities
industry
which
i
take
it
was
not
regulated
at
all
in
1789
but
as
of
30
to
40
years
ago
is
now
very
heavily
regulated.
would
you
feel
administrative
search
of
this
type
could
be
justified
of
a
security’s
dealer
justice
as
well
of
a
gun
dealer?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
why?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
reynolds,
it
seems
to
be
a
fair
implication
from
the
court’s
opinion
on
the
colonnade
case
that
if
your
client
had
been
in
the
liquor
business
and
that
same
had
happened
that
the
search
would
have
been
permissible.
do
you
disagree
with
that
as
a
statement
of
the
holding
or
the
--
at
least
the
dictum
in
colonnades?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
that,
you
mean
the
liquor
industry
being
one
case
and
the
gun
industry
being
another?
