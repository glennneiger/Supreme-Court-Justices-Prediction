justice
harry
a.
blackmun
when
you
make
that
statement,
don't
you
charge
landing
fees?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
you
have
rental
space
within
the
airport?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
isn't
it
a
disease
that
reflects
all
airports?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
of
course,
all
that
difference
isn’t
paid
by
the
airport
facility,
is
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
you
are
making
a
point
of
the
difference
in
the
cost
between
the
runways,
for
example
in
a
private
noncommercial
airport
and
that
in
the
more
of
commercial
one.
now
am
i
not
correct
in
my
impression
that
most
of
these
cost,
bulk
of
them
are
supplied
by
federal
grants?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
have
state
grants
in
(inaudible)?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
state
grants.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
in
some
states
such
funds
are
available
from
the
states?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
now
you
referred
to
the
1970
statute,
but
this
airport
was
constructed
prior
to
1970,
i
take
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
when
you
say
primarily
and
substantially,
do
you
mean
the
vast
majority
of
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
is
the
most
unusual
situation,
is
it
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
following
through
on
the
practicalities,
landing
fees
and
space
rentals
are
matter
primarily
of
negotiation
with
the
airlines,
are
they
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
do
i
assume
correctly
that
they
are
all
joined
together
to
resist
your
attempts
to
raise?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
do
i
also
assume
correctly
that
they
are
threatening
at
times
to
overfly,
if
you
get
too
high?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
don’t
you
have
a
tie-down
fees?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
mallory,
am
i
correct
in
my
impression
that
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
made
no
reference
to
this
allocation
of
50%
to
the
general
fund?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
was
it
argued
below?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
it
wasn’t
raised
prior
to
the
motion
for
the
rehearing?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
that
accept
for
the
denial
of
the
motion
it
was
not
treated
in
any
depth
at
all
by
the
new
hampshire
court?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
was
the
significance
of
your
comments
prior
to
last
few
questions
about
cab
allocating
funds
for
the
benefit
of
national
travel
as
whole?
are
you
suggesting
that
all
this
is
under-written
by
federal
funds?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
let
me
rephrase
my
question.
you
are
here
representing
a
number
of
airlines
on
these
two
cases?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
do
the
airlines
suggest
is
the
solution
for
these
cost
problems?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
by
the
facilities?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
because
airlines
just
do
not
like
landing
fees
anyway,
do
they?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
going
back
to
my
other
question
now,
where
would
you
impose
that
charge
that
you
speak
off?
are
you
saying
again,
i
guess
i
am
repeating,
are
you
suggesting
all
of
this
be
underwritten
by
federal
taxation?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
now
is
that
fact,
a
weakness
in
your
case
and
the
structure
of
the
tax?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
when
you
make

don't
