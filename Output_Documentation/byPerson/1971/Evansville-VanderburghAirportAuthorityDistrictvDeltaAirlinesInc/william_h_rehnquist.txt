justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
take
it
that
the
deficit
you
referred
is
the
failure
of
the
kind
of
charges
that
justice
blackmun
has
referred
to
to
cover
the
operating
expenses
of
the
airport?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
the
airport
district
is
larger
than
the
city
of
evansville
itself?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
have
a
stipulation,
do
you
not
as
to
145,000
versus
a
146,000,
very
closely
equivalent
between
(inaudible)?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
trockman,
i
suppose
there
is
some
equity
in
favor
of
a
dollar-a-head
enplaning
passenger
taxes
as
opposed
to
just
raising
the
landing
fee,
because
your
dollar-a-head-tax
enables
you
to
tax
more
heavily
to
delta
flight
that
comes
in
with
120
passengers
on
it
than
the
delta
flight
that
comes
in
with
10
passengers
on
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
if
you
live
on
your
own
road
to
the
tax.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
mallory?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
i
take
it
at
least
in
the
indiana
case
concede
that
the
state
can
impose
a
use
tax
to
make
interstate
commerce
pay
its
fair
share.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
yet
you
object
that
the
type
of
taxes
we're
dealing
with
here
are
on
the
act
of
enplanement
or
on
the
commerce,
and
i
grant
that
you
can
find
that
sort
of
distinction
in
some
of
our
prior
cases,
it
seems
to
me
a
very
metaphysical
kind
of
distinction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yet,
you
concede
that
a
passenger
doesn't
have
the
right
to
travel
at
the
state's
expense?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
isn't
a
landing
fee
which
i
take
it
under
your
line
of
reasoning
would
be
a
tax
on
the
act
of
landing
just
as
much
of
a
burden
on
commerce
or
a
tax
on
commerce
as
this
head
tax
on
the
act
of
enplanement?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
that
now
of
necessity
the
same
charge
should
be
made
for
using
san
francisco
international
airport
as
per
the
evansville
airport
or
the
laconia
airport?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though
the
cost
of
construction
per
passenger
might
vary
greatly?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
you’re
talking
about
raising
the
same
amount
of
money
by
two
alternative
ways,
one
by
increasing
the
landing
fee,
and
one
by
imposing
a
type
of
tax
that
new
hampshire
imposed,
isn't
the
ultimate
burden
on
the
airlines
going
to
be
the
same?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
is
the
only
way
they
can
pass
on
a
landing
fee
basically
is
to
get
a
rate
increase
out
the
cab?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course
it
is
not
and
exactly
i
could
say
this
tax
requires
the
airline
to
tax
(inaudible)
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
presumably,
no
part
of
the
new
hampshire
statute
is
violated
if
it
turns
out
if
the
cab
says
the
airline
can't
pass
on
the
tax?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
mallory.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
the
distinction
you
are
drawing
between
a
use
tax
and
the
kind
of
tax
you
say,
this
is
one
that
depends
on
the
intent
of
the
legislature?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
concede
that
the
airport
district
could
have
somehow
passed
along
some
of
its
costs
to
the
passenger
by
a
similar
tax
if
it
were
not
made
incidental
to
the
enplanement?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
isn’t
your
real
complaint
a
the
lack
of
apportionment
between
other
users
because
if
your
same
enplaning
passenger
had
to
pay
50
cents
as
he
went
to
the
turnstile
of
the
airport,
as
opposed
to
having
to
pay
a
dollar
fifteen
minutes
later,
that
wouldn't
make
all
of
much
difference
if
the
apportionment
was
fair,
was
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
enplaning
passengers
would
have
to
go
through
the
turnstile
too.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
wasn’t
the
tax
in
crandall
imposed
on
any
departing
passenger
regardless
of
what
means
of
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
supposing
in
crandall,
a
passenger
left
by
a
railroad,
there
the
state
wouldn’t
have
a
fair
claim
to
say.
we’re
just
asking
you
to
pay
your
share
for
the
cost
of
constructing
the
means
of
transportation.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
do
you
deal
with
huse
versus
glover
on
which
mr.
trockman
relies?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because
it’s
discriminatory
on
interstate
commerce?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
paying
in
case
of
freight?
in
the
case
of
freight
bill?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
take
