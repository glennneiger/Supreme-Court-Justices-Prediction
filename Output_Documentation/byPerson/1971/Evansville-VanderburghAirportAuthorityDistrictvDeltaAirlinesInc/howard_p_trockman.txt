mr.
howard
p.
trockman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
review
of
a
decision
of
the
indiana
supreme
court
rendered
on
december
23,
1970,
declaring
the
ordinance
involved
in
this
proceeding,
unconstitutional
under
the
commerce
clause
of
the
constitution.
the
petitioner,
evansville-vanderburgh
airport
authority
district,
is
a
regional
airport.
by
that
i
mean,
it
lies
in
the
southwestern
tip
of
indiana
and
is
utilized
by
not
only
the
residents
of
vanderburgh
county
indiana,
where
it
is
located,
but
by
many
people
residing
outside
of
the
area.
the
district
was
created
by
a
state
statute.
it
has
both
legislative
and
taxing
powers
and
it
was
created
specifically
to
operate
dress
regional
airport.
as
i
stated,
it
is
a
primary
airport
which
serves
illinois,
kentucky
as
well
southern
indiana
residents.
approximately,
300,000
people
move
through
this
airport
per
year
using
commercial
aircraft.
40%
of
these
users,
as
shown
by
the
stipulated
facts
in
this
cause
of
dress
airport
reside
outside
the
city
.the
yearly
operating
deficits
to
which
i
will
elude
later
in
this
argument,
are
supported
up
until
now
only
by
tax
levies
on
vanderburgh
county
property
owners.
the
stipulated
facts
which
i
refer
to
--
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
yes,
your
honor,
there
are
landing
fees
charged
by
contract
to
each
of
the
commercial
airlines
serving
the
airport.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
we
have
rental
space
within
the
airport
which
is
used
on
a
per
square
foot
basis
by
each
of
the
airlines.
during
the
course
of
this
appeal,
your
honor
and
i
have
pointed
this
out
in
the
reply
brief,
the
charges
which
we
are
attempting
to
establish
by
this
use
and
service
charge
ordinance
were
accepted
from
the
contract
of
renewal
of
all
of
these
lease
agreements
and
therefore
the
question
has
been
left
open
pending
the
outcome
of
this
review.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
exactly.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
i
don't
think
it
reflects
all
airports,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
i
feel
that
some
of
the
larger
airports
enjoy
a
very
handsome
revenue,
but
it
is
the
type
of
airport
that
comes
from
midwestern
part
of
the
united
states
such
as
the
small
or
medium
size
hub-airports
which
we
represent
with
a
space
and
perplexed
with
this
financial
problem
and
this
is
what
caused,
i
might
add,
the
passage
of
the
use
and
service
charge
ordinance
which
i
will
outline
to
you.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
the
raising
of
the
landing
fees,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
we
do
know
that
if
the
landing
fees
will
raise
that
this
type
of
raise
and
the
levy
would
be
passed
along
to
the
passenger
in
some
way.
either
the
air
fares
would
be
increased,
or
the
passengers
would
be
paying
for
this
charge
in
some
manner.
it's
obvious
to
me
and
i
think
it
probably
should
be
to
the
court
that
whatever
charges
are
paid
by
the
airlines
are
passed
along
to
the
ultimate
consumer
and
this
of
course,
is
the
purpose
of
the
use
and
service
charge
ordinance
in
this
particular
case.
it
is
designed
to
be
passed
along
to
the
consumer
on
a
user
basis,
not
on
the
basis
of
a
property
tax
that
just
effects
vanderburgh
county
residents
many
of
whom
never
use
the
airport.
but
when
we
have
some
120,000
people
residing
outside
the
perimeter
of
vanderburgh
county
using
this
airport
and
do
not
support
it
directly
through
any
property
tax,
we
feel
that
a
much
more
equitable
and
broader
base
of
support
should
be
made
and
that's
the
formulation
of
the
user
tax.
the
preamble
of
the
ordinance
in
question
recites
the
need
for
revenue
to
support
existing
and
future
facilities
at
the
airport.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
there
are
no
other
sources
for
tax
revenue
other
than
a
vanderburgh
county
property
tax
and
add
government
tax.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
yes
the
airport
has
up
until
this
legislature,
it
had
a
$0.12
limitation
on
each
$100
of
accessed
evaluation
of
property
in
vanderburgh
county.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
yes.
that's
correct.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
the
airport
district
is
coterminous
in
accordance
with
the
statute
with
the
boundary
lines
of
vanderburgh
county.
so
that
the
ad
valorem
tax
which
is
levied
to
support
the
deficit,
to
raise
the
deficit
to
keep
the
airport
in
existence,
it's
levied
only
on
the
vanderburgh
county
residents.
now
recognizing
the
need
for
revenue
to
support
the
existing
and
future
facilities,
and
by
the
way,
i
will
refer
later,
to
exhibit
d
which
is
the
part
of
the
stipulation
where
the
consultant's
report
requires
an
estimated
expenditure
of
local
funds
of
$6.9
million
of
airport
improvements.
the
airport
board
passed
this
ordinance
on
february
26,
1968.
it
notified
the
airlines
of
the
passage
of
this
ordinance
in
advance
and
notified
it
that
it
would
become
effective
on
july
1,
1968.
as
i
stated,
it
was
designed
in
part
to
deprave
the
cost
of
providing
commercial
airport
facilities
for
use
by
commercial
aircraft
and
commercial
passengers.
the
ordinance
establishes
a
$1
for
enplaning
passenger
charge
and
as
i
said,
it
is
on
the
passenger,
to
be
collected
by
the
airlines
and
remitted
twice
yearly.
it
applies
without
distinction
whatsoever
to
whether
the
passenger
travels
in
interstate
or
intrastate
commerce,
each
passenger
is
treated
the
same.
and
the
fact
that
these
respondent
airlines
might
subsequently
refer
to
the
fact
that
there
are
88%
more
or
less
people
who
are
traveling
outside
of
the
airport
to
locations
beyond
the
state
of
indiana
is
unimportant
and
i
don't
think
relevant
to
the
proceeding
as
long
as
interstate
and
intrastate
passengers
are
taxed
or
charged
equally.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
that
is
correct,
your
honor
and
you
will
find
a
stipulation
to
the
affect
that
enplaning
passenger
is
by
identity
the
deplaning
passenger
because
most
people
who
start
one
leg
of
a
journey
are
either
completing
a
journey
which
had
its
origin
in
evansville
or
completing
a
journey
which
had
its
origin
in
low
county
other
than
evansville.
so
it's
our
position
that
by
saying
enplaning
passenger,
we
are
reaching
all
commercial
airline
passengers.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
that's
correct,
regardless
of
his
residence.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
yes,
the
stipulation,
i
believe
is
a
very
per
stipulation
upon
which
we
rely,
found
at
page
53
of
the
appendix
at
the
bottom,
paragraph
ten.
i
am
sorry
that
is
not
the
stipulation.
i
think
it's
on
43.
anyway,
there
are
some
146,000
enplaning
passengers
at
dress
memorial
airport
in
1967
and
this
is
pointed
out
in
the
stipulations.
i
cannot
find
the
exact
location,
this
is
paragraph
12,
page
46
of
the
appendix
your
honor.
and
there
is
a
like
number
or
substantially
like
number
of
deplaning
passengers
at
the
airport
for
the
same
period.
now
for
the
first
time
in
any
use
tax
statute
that's
been
passed
by
any
state
or
local
municipality,
the
airlines
were
allowed
by
the
terms
of
this
ordinance,
a
6%
deduction
for
its
administrative
cost
of
collecting
the
passenger
enplanement
charge.
i
don't
know
of
any
other
statute,
sales
tax,
gross
income
tax,
highway
use
tax
statutes,
at
least
i
have
not
found
any
to
the
state
which
gives
to
the
airlines
or
gives
to
the
motor
carrier
an
allowance
for
this
administrative
charge
and
there
are
cases
of
course,
which
state
that
no
such
requirement
can
be
made
in
the
statute,
but
we
have
had
but
we
have
made
such
an
allowance.
the
ordinance
does
provide
that
the
proceeds
are
appropriated
for
the
capital
improvements
of
the
airport.
now
the
question
involved
in
this
proceeding
is
of
grave
and
vital
concern
of
the
preservation
of
state
and
local
governing
bodies
to
provide
and
improve
facilities
for
use
of
commerce
and
to
charge
reasonably
therefore.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
yes,
your
honor
there
was
a
statement
to
this
effect
and
i
am
prepared
to
respond
to
that
statement.
the
use
of
the
facilities
of
dress
regional
airport,
are
enjoyed
primarily
by
the
commercial
airline
passengers.
the
stipulations
involved
in
our
appendix
are
very
replete,
with
statements
to
the
effect
that
the
existing
facilities,
at
dress
memorial
airport,
dress
regional
airport,
would
not
be
essential
except
for
the
required
use
by
intrastate
commerce,
or
by
persons
traveling
in
commercial
aircraft,
and
i
would
like
to
refer
in
response
to
your
question,
to
pages
53,
54
and
55
of
the
appendix
where
these
stipulations
are
shown.
at
paragraph
10,
found
at
the
bottom
of
page
53
of
the
appendix,
the
stipulation
was
and
this
was
agreed
to
by
the
airlines
that
the
terminal
building
itself
would
not
be
essential
except
for
the
required
use
by
commercial
airlines
and
their
passengers.
and
also
in
reference
to
the
terminal
building,
most
of
their
facilities
constituting
the
terminal
building
would
likewise
not
be
necessary
except
for
the
required
use
by
commercial
airlines
and
their
passengers.
in
other
words,
it
would
not
be
required
for
noncommercial
or
private
aviation.
there
is
a
stipulation
also
your
honor
to
the
effect
that
the
runway
lengths,
the
approach
areas,
ramp
ways,
taxi
ways,
the
instrument
approach
lighting
systems
and
the
safety
aids
at
the
airport
would
not
even
be
necessary
to
accommodate
private
or
noncommercial
aircraft.
thus
they
are
provided
for
the
use
of
commercial
airlines,
and
the
comparison
which
we
have
made
which
i
think
is
very
interesting
at
paragraph
14,
page
54
of
the
appendix,
is
that
in
order
to
have
a
noncommercial
private
aviation
type
airport,
there
would
only
be
required
some
two
runways,
possibly
even
of
a
grass
strip
of
3,500-4,000
feet
which
would
cost
some
$20
or
$25
per
lineal
foot
to
construct.
but
in
order
to
accommodate
commercial
airlines
and
their
aircraft
and
the
passengers
who
travel
on
these
aircraft,
as
shown
at
paragraph
15,
page
55
of
the
stipulation,
present
construction
requirements
would
require
a
$200
per
lineal
foot,
expenditure.
making
a
comparison
of
the
cost
involved
for
noncommercial
as
opposed
to
commercial
aviation,
the
two
runways
that
i
mentioned
for
private
aircraft,
would
only
cost
some
$2,00,000,
8,000
feet
$25
per
lineal
foot.
the
required
cost
for
commercial
airlines,
using
these
same
runways
which
we
now
have
at
the
airport
some
16,000
feet
of
runways,
is
$3.2
million,
and
i
submit,
this
is
a
substantial
variation
in
cost
in
order
to
accommodate
commercial
airlines
and
their
passengers,
whether
they
be
intrastate
or
interstate.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
i
don't
believe
i
understand
your
question
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
no,
they
are
not
you
honor.
under
the
aviation
facilities
act
which
was
recently
amended
in
1970,
most
funds
which
could
be
contributed
in
granting
an
aid
towards
airport
improvements,
it
is
some
50%
of
the
project
cost.
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
the
airport
facilities
act,
there
was
a
statement
to
the
effect
that
substantial
expansion
of
the
local
airports
was
needed
to
provide
the
necessary
improvements
to
accommodate
commercial
aircraft,
and
commercial
airlines.
and
in
order
to
supply
these
improvements,
our
consultants
came
up
with
exhibit
'd'
which
is
shown
in
the
appendix,
some
$6.9
million
worth
of
expenditure,
solely
of
local
funds
after
deducting
all
possible
federal
grants
and
aid
which
would
be
available.
in
other
words,
the
project
would
be
of
a
cost
substantially
more
expensive
than
$6.9
million.
in
order
to
comply
with
the
needed
improvements
at
this
airport
and
this
consultant’s
report,
your
honor,
was
adopted
by
the
board
of
the
airport
authority
formally.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
we
have
state
grounds
--
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
no
state
grants
are
allotted
to
us.
we
work
through
the
state
aeronautics
commission
but
to
the
present
date,
no
funds
have
been
allotted
or
received
by
the
evansville
regional
airport
for
the
construction
of
funds.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
through
some
type
of
state
wise
tax
levied,
but
not
yet
through
the
state
of
indiana.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
it
was
constructed
sometime
before
that.
it
was
actually
constructed
and
substantially
recorded
(ph)
during
the
war
in
order
to
accommodate
aircraft
using
the
airport,
who
were
using
local
military
industry.
but
the
funds
for
this
airport,
your
honor,
have
primarily
and
substantially
been
provided
at
the
cost
and
expense
of
vanderburgh
county
residents
and
this
is
shown
definitely
by
the
stipulations.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
well,
no
it
is
not
unusual.
for
instance
when
it
comes
to
the
terminal
building
up
at
least
until
recently,
our
recent
expansion
of
the
terminal
building,
did
not
result
in
any
receipt
to
federal
funds.
we
recently
had
a
$980,000
bond
issue
which
is
also
recited
in
the
stipulations
for
the
purpose
of
financing
a
construction
of
an
addition
to
our
terminal
building.
federal
grants
and
aid
don't
reach
terminal
buildings
or
roadways,
leading
to
the
terminal
building
for
instance.
but
federal
grants
and
aid
do
reach
runways
and
taxi
ways
to
which
federal
grants
will
supply
approximately
50%
of
the
funds.
but
congress
nor
the
federal
aviation
administration
has
not
undertaken
the
burden
of
financing
the
improvements,
at
dress
airport,
that
is
on
the
local
airport
and
until
now
on
the
local
county
residents.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
they
pay
a
square
footage
charge
for
the
office
spaces
which
they
utilize
and
at
most
airports,
including
dress,
they
pay
an
enplanement
charge
but
a
charge
which
is
based
up
on
the
gross
landing
weight
of
a
particular
aircraft.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
there
is
no
question
about
it.
if
they
don't,
the
airlines
are
operated
with
a
substantial
deficit
as
we
do.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
well,
i
think
your
honor
this
is
what
we
have
done
by
passing
ordinance
number
33,
rather
than
funneling
it
through
the
airlines,
by
charging
the
airlines,
a
dollar
for
enplanement
passenger
fee,
which
we
know
ultimately
will
be
passed
along
to
the
consumers,
the
commercial
airline
passenger,
we
have
tax
and
has
established
use
and
service
charge,
for
the
airline
passenger
which
is
designed
to
be
collected
--
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
well,
at
the
time
we
did
have
a
contract
with
the
airlines
which
did
specify
a
certain
gross
landing
weight.
this
was
one
consideration,
but
the
board’s
explanation
of
this
was
that
if
there
was
going
to
be
passed
along
to
this
consumer,
the
airport
is
going
to
be
used
on
a
user
basis,
if
they
want
to
have
a
more
equitable
use
of
the
facilities
and
let
the
people
pay
for
it
according
to
the
use
then
why
not
pass
it
along
the
passenger
since
they
are
going
to
pay
for
it
anyway.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
we
do
mr.
justice
white
because
the
deplaning
passenger
also
is
an
emplaning
passenger.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
that’s
right.
when
i
depart
dress
regional
airport
for
washington
dc,
i
am
not
going
to
be
driving
back
normally,
unless
the
weather
does
not
permit
me
to
fly.
i
am
going
to
be
returning
to
the
dress
regional
airport
by
aircraft.
the
same
is
true
for
anyone
who
is
traveling
to
evansville.
they
are
going
to
board
an
airplane
and
to
complete
the
second
leg
of
their
journey,
after
they
arrive
there
and
transact
whatever
business
they
might
have.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
well
yes
we
do,
and
the
stipulations
do
show
that
--
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
our
airport
concessioners
pay
us
--
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
--
pay
us
rent
and
pay
us
on
the
basis
of
a
gross
percentage
of
the
food
prices
charged
to
the
consumers
who
eat
in
the
restaurant
for
instance.
the
charge
is
7.5%
as
shown
by
the
stipulations.
we
get
7.5%
for
every
item
of
food,
and
12.5%
for
every
item
of
drink,
alcoholic
beverage
which
is
consumed
on
the
premises.
the
airport
parking
is
gauged
on
a
similar
method.
we
receive
up
to
80%
for
the
parking
fee.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
that
is
correct.
and
lot
of
this
is
--
we
attempt
to
pass
along
to
the
airlines,
but
we
have
not
yet
had
a
fair
return
to
support
this
facility.
and
if
we
are
just
going
to
support
this
facility
in
accordance
with
the
way
our
consultants
tell
us
that
it
needs
to
be
supported
by
the
construction
of
additional
capital
improvements,
as
is
shown
by
the
stipulations,
we
are
going
to
run
out
of
tax
money
to
pay
for
these
improvements
and
we
need
another
method
to
with
--
we
need
the
method
of
the
enplanement
service
charge
to
help
us
finance
these
improvements.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
that’s
correct.
theoretically,
the
weight
of
the
aircraft
and
use
of
the
facility
is
more
with
the
use
of
more
per
passenger
plane
movements,
and
we
feel
that
by
having
such
a
charge
is
much
more
equitable
method
of
measuring
our
revenues
and
in
arriving
at
an
equitable
charge.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
that
is
correct.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
no
question
about
that.
they
have
done
so
in
the
past.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
to
be
fair,
i
don’t
think
the
airlines
have
ever
made
such
a
statement.
i
know
they
have
rebutted
but
they
have
never
made
such
a
statement.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
well
under
the
cab
regulations
they
are
required
under
their
certificated
routes
to
fly
between
certain
points.
for
instance,
we
have
in
our
stipulations
that
some
88%
of
the
people
fly
outside
the
airport
to
locations
beyond
the
state
of
indiana.
since
the
appeal
of
this
case
allegheny
for
instance,
has
added
another
flight
which
has
a
flight
terminating
in
indianapolis,
indiana.
so
that
the
percentages
are
constantly
going
to
be
changing,
and
it
maybe
88:12
one
year,
and
it
might
60:40
the
next,
but
i
think
this
aspect
of
it
is
immaterial
so
long
as
we
reach
both
the
implanting
passengers
who
arrives
and
departs
in
indianapolis
or
evansville
and
the
passenger
who
goes
beyond
the
state
of
indiana.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
private
aircraft
--
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
--
is
used
on
the
--
we
receive
revenues
from
private
aircraft
indirectly
through
a
fix
based
operators
who
maintain
hanger
facilities
and
repair
facilities
for
these
aircraft.
any
gasoline
which
is
sold
to
private
aircraft
at
the
airport,
we
receive
$0.5
per
gallon
revenue,
and
this
is
a
substantial
amount
of
money.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
unquestionably
we
do
derive
revenue,
substantial
revenue
from
our
flowage
fees.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
tie-down
fees
are
actually
charged
by
the
fixed
based
operators.
now,
they
also
pay
on
a
square
footage
space
contract
which
they
have.
but
the
actual
revenue,
the
substantial
revenue
which
we
derive
is
through
the
flowage
fee,
that's
paid
by
the
private
commercial
or
private
airline
aircraft
owners.
but
we
submit
that
the
use
and
service
charge
in
question
is
in
essence,
no
different
from
the
federal
excise
tax
of
8%
which
is
levied
by
the
federal
government
in
order
to
adopt
and
ask
their
50%
share
of
some
of
the
grants
and
aid
for
improvements
which
are
made.
and
it's
certainly
no
different
than
the
charges
that
are
made
by
the
airlines
for
the
use
of
aircraft
because
it's
all
designed
and
gauged
by
the
use
of
the
facilities
given
and
offered
to
the
passenger
for
its
use.
article
1,
section
8,
clause
3
of
the
federal
constitution,
grants
to
congress
the
power
to
regulate
commerce.
but
we
contend,
and
the
cases
show
this,
that
it
does
not
give
it
the
exclusive
power,
only
the
power
to
regulate
it
in
its
entirety
if
it
sees
fit.
that
congress
has
not
shown
fit
to
preclude
the
states
from
any
reasonable
regulations.
and
as
i
say
the
question
involved
in
this
proceeding
is
whether
we
can
require
congress
to
pay
its
own
way
for
the
use
of
variable
facilities
which
we
are
furnished
to
commerce
and
secondarily
whether
the
dollar
charge
is
reasonable.
in
a
braniff
airlines
case
in
1954,
the
civil
aeronautics
act
of
1938
was
called
into
question
and
this
court
stated
that
this
act
did
not
exclude
or
preempt
the
states
from
passing
or
enacting
reasonable
regulations
and
until
an
act
of
congress
overrides
all
conflicting
legislation,
the
states
can
pass
reasonable
regulations
for
the
use
of
its
facilities.
as
i
stated
the
aviation
facilities
act
has
already
made
the
demands
on
local
government
to
improve
its
airport
system.
and
the
act
further
requires
minimum
standards
that
have
to
be
a
established
by
local
airports,
in
order
to
serve
as
commercial
airports.
in
the
general
motors
case,
we
feel
that
this
is
very
pertinent
on
the
subject
decided
in
1965
and
quoted
it
in
our
opinion,
it
is
not
whether
a
state,
or
whether
commerce
can
be
taxed,
it
is
how
it
can
be
taxed.
our
first
significant
case,
we
feel,
it
was
decided
on
the
use
of
valuable
facilities
furnished
to
commerce
was
back
in
1886
in
the
case
of
huse
versus
glover.
this
involved
the
tax
for
the
use
of
artificially
constructed
navigational
facilities.
although
i
am
not
going
to
quote
extensively
from
this
case,
i
think
the
rationale
of
this
case
requires
as
much
today
as
it
did
it
1886.
the
court
said,
how
the
highways
of
a
state,
whether
on
land
or
by
water
may
be
best
improved
is
a
matter
for
state
determination.
and
it
is
not
the
purpose
of
the
commerce
clause,
the
court
goes
on
to
say,
to
relive
those
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
of
their
just
share
of
the
state
tax
burden.
this
court
stated,
and
it
is
repeatedly
held
that
the
private
inconvenience
must
yield
to
the
public
good.
and
significantly
we
say,
that
the
only
bridge
that
needs
to
be
gapped
between
1886
and
1972,
the
date
that
we
argue
this
case,
is
the
fact
that
the
highways
that
the
runways
of
our
airport
and
indeed
the
highways
of
our
airport.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
i
think
--
i
think
your
honor
that
would
make
a
very
large
difference,
but
we
have
appropriated
this
--
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
we
might
be
stuck
with
crandall,
but
crandall
as
the
respondents
have
rigorously
argued
is
a
mere
departure
tax,
it's
a
mere
tax
to
leave
the
state.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
it's
not
even
based
upon
the
use
of
facility.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
that
is
correct.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
that
is
correct.
in
almost
every
case
that
is
found
throughout
the
airlines'
briefs
your
honor
that
involves
discrimination
or
national
uniformity
is
either
based
upon
the
fact
that
interstate
commerce
is
taxed
is
an
unequal
matter
to
that
of
interstate
commerce.
local
interstate
users
were
not
being
taxed
under
these
use
tax
statutes.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
that
is
correct.
now,
we
have
in
our
stipulations,
a
statement
to
the
effect,
that
the
revenues
to
be
derived
by
the
maximum
tax
levies
of
vanderburgh
county,
indiana
plus
the
revenue
which
we
intend
to
derive
from
this
use
and
service
charge
ordinance,
will
not
even
then
be
sufficient
to
complete
our
overall
improvement
program
in
order
to
comply
with
the
consultant's
report
and
what
we
determine,
the
aviation
facilities
act,
demands
that
we
make
at
the
airport.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
that
is
so,
yes,
but
there
are
cases
that
i've
read
in
the
effect
that
such
a
tax
is
not
constitutional,
if
it's
not
appropriated
for
the
purpose
for
providing
the
improvements
needed
and
enjoyed
by
commerce.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
that
could
be
done,
yes,
unfortunately.
now,
the
aero
mayflower
case
versus
railroad
commission
which
was
decided
in
1947,
cited
at
page
28
of
our
brief,
tells
that
even
where
a
state
has
received
federal
aid,
and
this
runs
to
a
question
that
you
asked
me
mr.
justice
blackmun,
that
even
where
a
state
receives
federal
funds
that
a
gross
receipts
tax
on
motor
carriage
was
valid.
and
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
the
state
was
not
required
to
furnish
facilities
to
commerce
free
of
charge.
and
this
holding
has
been
upheld
by
this
court,
has
been
repeated
by
this
court
in
the
aero
mayflower
case,
the
sprout
case,
the
bingaman
case
all
of
which
we
have
cited
in
our
briefs.
so
we
say
the
incidence
of
the
charge
as
the
respondents
argue
is
not
only
on
the
act
of
enplanement,
but
it
is
on
the
valuable
use
of
airport
facilities
furnished
at
a
great
burden
and
expense
to
vanderburgh
county
taxpayers.
we
submit
your
honor
that
the
use
and
service
charge
of
this
nature
is
not
only
constitutional,
but
equitable
in
nature.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
i
will
try
to
use
them
as
useful
as
i
can.
first
of
all,
i
would
like
to
comment,
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
on
crandall
versus
nevada.
there
is
no
mention
on
this
case
whatsoever
that
this
is
a
tax
upon
the
use
of
facilities.
it
is
the
tax
upon
the
mere
act
of
departure
upon
the
privilege
of
going
from
one
state
to
the
other.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
1868,
when
this
case
was
decided,
i
am
not
even
sure
that
there
was
a
publicly
maintained
roadway
for
the
use
by
a
stage
coach
travel.
certainly,
the
railroad
tax
filed
with
that
case
was
not
for
the
use
of
publicly
supported
facilities.
and
as
far
as
the
application
of
that
case
is
concerned,
this
was
stricken
and
overruled
by
the
case
of
hendrick
versus
maryland
which
was
decided
in
1915
by
this
court.
and
in
this
case,
it
said
that
with
respect
to
the
holding
of
crandall
versus
nevada
involving
a
tax
which
was
designed
to
prevent
persons
from
leaving
the
state
of
nevada,
that
it
does
not
uphold
that
rationale
because
in
hendrick
versus
maryland,
where
a
tax
was
levied
upon
the
use
of
highways
by
commercial
motor
vehicles,
that
this
involved
the
use
of
valuable
facilities
provided
in
public
expense
and
a
burden
to
the
taxpayers.
and
therefore,
the
holding
of
crandall
was
overruled.
and
in
hendrick
versus
maryland,
which
is
cited
at
pages
29
and
30
of
our
brief,
the
court
stated
that
the
highways
are
public
property
just
like
our
runways
are.
it
is
within
the
power
of
the
state
to
require
those
who
make
special
use
thereof
to
contribute
to
their
cost
in
maintenance.
and
this
court
recognized
in
hendrick
versus
maryland,
the
distinction
between
commercial
motor
vehicles
and
pleasure
cars
and
upheld
the
tax.
the
same
application
applied
in
a
flat
fee
in
the
capitol
greyhound
lines
case.
by
the
way,
in
that
case
as
we
have
in
our
exhibit
c
is
a
list
of
states
which
have
use
taxes.
as
to
the
national
uniformity
argument
which
my
colleague
argues,
i
would
like
to
say
this
that
the
panhandle
eastern
case
strikes
down
this
argument
by
saying
the
power
to
taxes
not
the
power
to
destroy.
and
this
we
believe
is
a
relevant
holding
cited
by
this
court
and
we
feel
that
the
use
tax
levied
in
this
instance
is
fair
and
reasonable
under
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
review
of
a
decision
of
the
indiana
supreme
court
rendered
on
december
23,
1970,
declaring
the
ordinance
involved
in
this
proceeding,
unconstitutional
under
the
commerce
clause
of
the
constitution.
the
petitioner,
evansville-vanderburgh
airport
authority
district,
is
a
regional
airport.
by
that
i
mean,
it
lies
in
the
southwestern
tip
of
indiana
and
is
utilized
by
not
only
the
residents
of
vanderburgh
county
indiana,
where
it
is
located,
but
by
many
people
residing
outside
of
the
area.
the
district
was
created
by
a
state
statute.
it
has
both
legislative
and
taxing
powers
and
it
was
created
specifically
to
operate
dress
regional
airport.
as
i
stated,
it
is
a
primary
airport
which
serves
illinois,
kentucky
as
well
southern
indiana
residents.
approximately,
300,000
people
move
through
this
airport
per
year
using
commercial
aircraft.
40%
of
these
users,
as
shown
by
the
stipulated
facts
in
this
cause
of
dress
airport
reside
outside
the
city
.the
yearly
operating
deficits
to
which
i
will
elude
later
in
this
argument,
are
supported
up
until
now
only
by
tax
levies
on
vanderburgh
county
property
owners.
the
stipulated
facts
which
i
refer
to
--
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
yes,
your
honor,
there
are
landing
fees
charged
by
contract
to
each
of
the
commercial
airlines
serving
the
airport.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
we
have
rental
space
within
the
airport
which
is
used
on
a
per
square
foot
basis
by
each
of
the
airlines.
during
the
course
of
this
appeal,
your
honor
and
i
have
pointed
this
out
in
the
reply
brief,
the
charges
which
we
are
attempting
to
establish
by
this
use
and
service
charge
ordinance
were
accepted
from
the
contract
of
renewal
of
all
of
these
lease
agreements
and
therefore
the
question
has
been
left
open
pending
the
outcome
of
this
review.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
exactly.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
i
don't
think
it
reflects
all
airports,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
i
feel
that
some
of
the
larger
airports
enjoy
a
very
handsome
revenue,
but
it
is
the
type
of
airport
that
comes
from
midwestern
part
of
the
united
states
such
as
the
small
or
medium
size
hub-airports
which
we
represent
with
a
space
and
perplexed
with
this
financial
problem
and
this
is
what
caused,
i
might
add,
the
passage
of
the
use
and
service
charge
ordinance
which
i
will
outline
to
you.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
the
raising
of
the
landing
fees,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
we
do
know
that
if
the
landing
fees
will
raise
that
this
type
of
raise
and
the
levy
would
be
passed
along
to
the
passenger
in
some
way.
either
the
air
fares
would
be
increased,
or
the
passengers
would
be
paying
for
this
charge
in
some
manner.
it's
obvious
to
me
and
i
think
it
probably
should
be
to
the
court
that
whatever
charges
are
paid
by
the
airlines
are
passed
along
to
the
ultimate
consumer
and
this
of
course,
is
the
purpose
of
the
use
and
service
charge
ordinance
in
this
particular
case.
it
is
designed
to
be
passed
along
to
the
consumer
on
a
user
basis,
not
on
the
basis
of
a
property
tax
that
just
effects
vanderburgh
county
residents
many
of
whom
never
use
the
airport.
but
when
we
have
some
120,000
people
residing
outside
the
perimeter
of
vanderburgh
county
using
this
airport
and
do
not
support
it
directly
through
any
property
tax,
we
feel
that
a
much
more
equitable
and
broader
base
of
support
should
be
made
and
that's
the
formulation
of
the
user
tax.
the
preamble
of
the
ordinance
in
question
recites
the
need
for
revenue
to
support
existing
and
future
facilities
at
the
airport.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
there
are
no
other
sources
for
tax
revenue
other
than
a
vanderburgh
county
property
tax
and
add
government
tax.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
yes
the
airport
has
up
until
this
legislature,
it
had
a
$0.12
limitation
on
each
$100
of
accessed
evaluation
of
property
in
vanderburgh
county.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
yes.
that's
correct.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
the
airport
district
is
coterminous
in
accordance
with
the
statute
with
the
boundary
lines
of
vanderburgh
county.
so
that
the
ad
valorem
tax
which
is
levied
to
support
the
deficit,
to
raise
the
deficit
to
keep
the
airport
in
existence,
it's
levied
only
on
the
vanderburgh
county
residents.
now
recognizing
the
need
for
revenue
to
support
the
existing
and
future
facilities,
and
by
the
way,
i
will
refer
later,
to
exhibit
d
which
is
the
part
of
the
stipulation
where
the
consultant's
report
requires
an
estimated
expenditure
of
local
funds
of
$6.9
million
of
airport
improvements.
the
airport
board
passed
this
ordinance
on
february
26,
1968.
it
notified
the
airlines
of
the
passage
of
this
ordinance
in
advance
and
notified
it
that
it
would
become
effective
on
july
1,
1968.
as
i
stated,
it
was
designed
in
part
to
deprave
the
cost
of
providing
commercial
airport
facilities
for
use
by
commercial
aircraft
and
commercial
passengers.
the
ordinance
establishes
a
$1
for
enplaning
passenger
charge
and
as
i
said,
it
is
on
the
passenger,
to
be
collected
by
the
airlines
and
remitted
twice
yearly.
it
applies
without
distinction
whatsoever
to
whether
the
passenger
travels
in
interstate
or
intrastate
commerce,
each
passenger
is
treated
the
same.
and
the
fact
that
these
respondent
airlines
might
subsequently
refer
to
the
fact
that
there
are
88%
more
or
less
people
who
are
traveling
outside
of
the
airport
to
locations
beyond
the
state
of
indiana
is
unimportant
and
i
don't
think
relevant
to
the
proceeding
as
long
as
interstate
and
intrastate
passengers
are
taxed
or
charged
equally.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
that
is
correct,
your
honor
and
you
will
find
a
stipulation
to
the
affect
that
enplaning
passenger
is
by
identity
the
deplaning
passenger
because
most
people
who
start
one
leg
of
a
journey
are
either
completing
a
journey
which
had
its
origin
in
evansville
or
completing
a
journey
which
had
its
origin
in
low
county
other
than
evansville.
so
it's
our
position
that
by
saying
enplaning
passenger,
we
are
reaching
all
commercial
airline
passengers.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
that's
correct,
regardless
of
his
residence.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
yes,
the
stipulation,
i
believe
is
a
very
per
stipulation
upon
which
we
rely,
found
at
page
53
of
the
appendix
at
the
bottom,
paragraph
ten.
i
am
sorry
that
is
not
the
stipulation.
i
think
it's
on
43.
anyway,
there
are
some
146,000
enplaning
passengers
at
dress
memorial
airport
in
1967
and
this
is
pointed
out
in
the
stipulations.
i
cannot
find
the
exact
location,
this
is
paragraph
12,
page
46
of
the
appendix
your
honor.
and
there
is
a
like
number
or
substantially
like
number
of
deplaning
passengers
at
the
airport
for
the
same
period.
now
for
the
first
time
in
any
use
tax
statute
that's
been
passed
by
any
state
or
local
municipality,
the
airlines
were
allowed
by
the
terms
of
this
ordinance,
a
6%
deduction
for
its
administrative
cost
of
collecting
the
passenger
enplanement
charge.
i
don't
know
of
any
other
statute,
sales
tax,
gross
income
tax,
highway
use
tax
statutes,
at
least
i
have
not
found
any
to
the
state
which
gives
to
the
airlines
or
gives
to
the
motor
carrier
an
allowance
for
this
administrative
charge
and
there
are
cases
of
course,
which
state
that
no
such
requirement
can
be
made
in
the
statute,
but
we
have
had
but
we
have
made
such
an
allowance.
the
ordinance
does
provide
that
the
proceeds
are
appropriated
for
the
capital
improvements
of
the
airport.
now
the
question
involved
in
this
proceeding
is
of
grave
and
vital
concern
of
the
preservation
of
state
and
local
governing
bodies
to
provide
and
improve
facilities
for
use
of
commerce
and
to
charge
reasonably
therefore.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
yes,
your
honor
there
was
a
statement
to
this
effect
and
i
am
prepared
to
respond
to
that
statement.
the
use
of
the
facilities
of
dress
regional
airport,
are
enjoyed
primarily
by
the
commercial
airline
passengers.
the
stipulations
involved
in
our
appendix
are
very
replete,
with
statements
to
the
effect
that
the
existing
facilities,
at
dress
memorial
airport,
dress
regional
airport,
would
not
be
essential
except
for
the
required
use
by
intrastate
commerce,
or
by
persons
traveling
in
commercial
aircraft,
and
i
would
like
to
refer
in
response
to
your
question,
to
pages
53,
54
and
55
of
the
appendix
where
these
stipulations
are
shown.
at
paragraph
10,
found
at
the
bottom
of
page
53
of
the
appendix,
the
stipulation
was
and
this
was
agreed
to
by
the
airlines
that
the
terminal
building
itself
would
not
be
essential
except
for
the
required
use
by
commercial
airlines
and
their
passengers.
and
also
in
reference
to
the
terminal
building,
most
of
their
facilities
constituting
the
terminal
building
would
likewise
not
be
necessary
except
for
the
required
use
by
commercial
airlines
and
their
passengers.
in
other
words,
it
would
not
be
required
for
noncommercial
or
private
aviation.
there
is
a
stipulation
also
your
honor
to
the
effect
that
the
runway
lengths,
the
approach
areas,
ramp
ways,
taxi
ways,
the
instrument
approach
lighting
systems
and
the
safety
aids
at
the
airport
would
not
even
be
necessary
to
accommodate
private
or
noncommercial
aircraft.
thus
they
are
provided
for
the
use
of
commercial
airlines,
and
the
comparison
which
we
have
made
which
i
think
is
very
interesting
at
paragraph
14,
page
54
of
the
appendix,
is
that
in
order
to
have
a
noncommercial
private
aviation
type
airport,
there
would
only
be
required
some
two
runways,
possibly
even
of
a
grass
strip
of
3,500-4,000
feet
which
would
cost
some
$20
or
$25
per
lineal
foot
to
construct.
but
in
order
to
accommodate
commercial
airlines
and
their
aircraft
and
the
passengers
who
travel
on
these
aircraft,
as
shown
at
paragraph
15,
page
55
of
the
stipulation,
present
construction
requirements
would
require
a
$200
per
lineal
foot,
expenditure.
making
a
comparison
of
the
cost
involved
for
noncommercial
as
opposed
to
commercial
aviation,
the
two
runways
that
i
mentioned
for
private
aircraft,
would
only
cost
some
$2,00,000,
8,000
feet
$25
per
lineal
foot.
the
required
cost
for
commercial
airlines,
using
these
same
runways
which
we
now
have
at
the
airport
some
16,000
feet
of
runways,
is
$3.2
million,
and
i
submit,
this
is
a
substantial
variation
in
cost
in
order
to
accommodate
commercial
airlines
and
their
passengers,
whether
they
be
intrastate
or
interstate.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
i
don't
believe
i
understand
your
question
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
no,
they
are
not
you
honor.
under
the
aviation
facilities
act
which
was
recently
amended
in
1970,
most
funds
which
could
be
contributed
in
granting
an
aid
towards
airport
improvements,
it
is
some
50%
of
the
project
cost.
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
the
airport
facilities
act,
there
was
a
statement
to
the
effect
that
substantial
expansion
of
the
local
airports
was
needed
to
provide
the
necessary
improvements
to
accommodate
commercial
aircraft,
and
commercial
airlines.
and
in
order
to
supply
these
improvements,
our
consultants
came
up
with
exhibit
'd'
which
is
shown
in
the
appendix,
some
$6.9
million
worth
of
expenditure,
solely
of
local
funds
after
deducting
all
possible
federal
grants
and
aid
which
would
be
available.
in
other
words,
the
project
would
be
of
a
cost
substantially
more
expensive
than
$6.9
million.
in
order
to
comply
with
the
needed
improvements
at
this
airport
and
this
consultant’s
report,
your
honor,
was
adopted
by
the
board
of
the
airport
authority
formally.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
we
have
state
grounds
--
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
no
state
grants
are
allotted
to
us.
we
work
through
the
state
aeronautics
commission
but
to
the
present
date,
no
funds
have
been
allotted
or
received
by
the
evansville
regional
airport
for
the
construction
of
funds.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
through
some
type
of
state
wise
tax
levied,
but
not
yet
through
the
state
of
indiana.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
it
was
constructed
sometime
before
that.
it
was
actually
constructed
and
substantially
recorded
(ph)
during
the
war
in
order
to
accommodate
aircraft
using
the
airport,
who
were
using
local
military
industry.
but
the
funds
for
this
airport,
your
honor,
have
primarily
and
substantially
been
provided
at
the
cost
and
expense
of
vanderburgh
county
residents
and
this
is
shown
definitely
by
the
stipulations.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
well,
no
it
is
not
unusual.
for
instance
when
it
comes
to
the
terminal
building
up
at
least
until
recently,
our
recent
expansion
of
the
terminal
building,
did
not
result
in
any
receipt
to
federal
funds.
we
recently
had
a
$980,000
bond
issue
which
is
also
recited
in
the
stipulations
for
the
purpose
of
financing
a
construction
of
an
addition
to
our
terminal
building.
federal
grants
and
aid
don't
reach
terminal
buildings
or
roadways,
leading
to
the
terminal
building
for
instance.
but
federal
grants
and
aid
do
reach
runways
and
taxi
ways
to
which
federal
grants
will
supply
approximately
50%
of
the
funds.
but
congress
nor
the
federal
aviation
administration
has
not
undertaken
the
burden
of
financing
the
improvements,
at
dress
airport,
that
is
on
the
local
airport
and
until
now
on
the
local
county
residents.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
they
pay
a
square
footage
charge
for
the
office
spaces
which
they
utilize
and
at
most
airports,
including
dress,
they
pay
an
enplanement
charge
but
a
charge
which
is
based
up
on
the
gross
landing
weight
of
a
particular
aircraft.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
there
is
no
question
about
it.
if
they
don't,
the
airlines
are
operated
with
a
substantial
deficit
as
we
do.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
well,
i
think
your
honor
this
is
what
we
have
done
by
passing
ordinance
number
33,
rather
than
funneling
it
through
the
airlines,
by
charging
the
airlines,
a
dollar
for
enplanement
passenger
fee,
which
we
know
ultimately
will
be
passed
along
to
the
consumers,
the
commercial
airline
passenger,
we
have
tax
and
has
established
use
and
service
charge,
for
the
airline
passenger
which
is
designed
to
be
collected
--
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
well,
at
the
time
we
did
have
a
contract
with
the
airlines
which
did
specify
a
certain
gross
landing
weight.
this
was
one
consideration,
but
the
board’s
explanation
of
this
was
that
if
there
was
going
to
be
passed
along
to
this
consumer,
the
airport
is
going
to
be
used
on
a
user
basis,
if
they
want
to
have
a
more
equitable
use
of
the
facilities
and
let
the
people
pay
for
it
according
to
the
use
then
why
not
pass
it
along
the
passenger
since
they
are
going
to
pay
for
it
anyway.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
we
do
mr.
justice
white
because
the
deplaning
passenger
also
is
an
emplaning
passenger.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
that’s
right.
when
i
depart
dress
regional
airport
for
washington
dc,
i
am
not
going
to
be
driving
back
normally,
unless
the
weather
does
not
permit
me
to
fly.
i
am
going
to
be
returning
to
the
dress
regional
airport
by
aircraft.
the
same
is
true
for
anyone
who
is
traveling
to
evansville.
they
are
going
to
board
an
airplane
and
to
complete
the
second
leg
of
their
journey,
after
they
arrive
there
and
transact
whatever
business
they
might
have.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
well
yes
we
do,
and
the
stipulations
do
show
that
--
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
our
airport
concessioners
pay
us
--
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
--
pay
us
rent
and
pay
us
on
the
basis
of
a
gross
percentage
of
the
food
prices
charged
to
the
consumers
who
eat
in
the
restaurant
for
instance.
the
charge
is
7.5%
as
shown
by
the
stipulations.
we
get
7.5%
for
every
item
of
food,
and
12.5%
for
every
item
of
drink,
alcoholic
beverage
which
is
consumed
on
the
premises.
the
airport
parking
is
gauged
on
a
similar
method.
we
receive
up
to
80%
for
the
parking
fee.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
that
is
correct.
and
lot
of
this
is
--
we
attempt
to
pass
along
to
the
airlines,
but
we
have
not
yet
had
a
fair
return
to
support
this
facility.
and
if
we
are
just
going
to
support
this
facility
in
accordance
with
the
way
our
consultants
tell
us
that
it
needs
to
be
supported
by
the
construction
of
additional
capital
improvements,
as
is
shown
by
the
stipulations,
we
are
going
to
run
out
of
tax
money
to
pay
for
these
improvements
and
we
need
another
method
to
with
--
we
need
the
method
of
the
enplanement
service
charge
to
help
us
finance
these
improvements.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
that’s
correct.
theoretically,
the
weight
of
the
aircraft
and
use
of
the
facility
is
more
with
the
use
of
more
per
passenger
plane
movements,
and
we
feel
that
by
having
such
a
charge
is
much
more
equitable
method
of
measuring
our
revenues
and
in
arriving
at
an
equitable
charge.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
that
is
correct.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
no
question
about
that.
they
have
done
so
in
the
past.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
to
be
fair,
i
don’t
think
the
airlines
have
ever
made
such
a
statement.
i
know
they
have
rebutted
but
they
have
never
made
such
a
statement.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
well
under
the
cab
regulations
they
are
required
under
their
certificated
routes
to
fly
between
certain
points.
for
instance,
we
have
in
our
stipulations
that
some
88%
of
the
people
fly
outside
the
airport
to
locations
beyond
the
state
of
indiana.
since
the
appeal
of
this
case
allegheny
for
instance,
has
added
another
flight
which
has
a
flight
terminating
in
indianapolis,
indiana.
so
that
the
percentages
are
constantly
going
to
be
changing,
and
it
maybe
88:12
one
year,
and
it
might
60:40
the
next,
but
i
think
this
aspect
of
it
is
immaterial
so
long
as
we
reach
both
the
implanting
passengers
who
arrives
and
departs
in
indianapolis
or
evansville
and
the
passenger
who
goes
beyond
the
state
of
indiana.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
private
aircraft
--
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
--
is
used
on
the
--
we
receive
revenues
from
private
aircraft
indirectly
through
a
fix
based
operators
who
maintain
hanger
facilities
and
repair
facilities
for
these
aircraft.
any
gasoline
which
is
sold
to
private
aircraft
at
the
airport,
we
receive
$0.5
per
gallon
revenue,
and
this
is
a
substantial
amount
of
money.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
unquestionably
we
do
derive
revenue,
substantial
revenue
from
our
flowage
fees.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
tie-down
fees
are
actually
charged
by
the
fixed
based
operators.
now,
they
also
pay
on
a
square
footage
space
contract
which
they
have.
but
the
actual
revenue,
the
substantial
revenue
which
we
derive
is
through
the
flowage
fee,
that's
paid
by
the
private
commercial
or
private
airline
aircraft
owners.
but
we
submit
that
the
use
and
service
charge
in
question
is
in
essence,
no
different
from
the
federal
excise
tax
of
8%
which
is
levied
by
the
federal
government
in
order
to
adopt
and
ask
their
50%
share
of
some
of
the
grants
and
aid
for
improvements
which
are
made.
and
it's
certainly
no
different
than
the
charges
that
are
made
by
the
airlines
for
the
use
of
aircraft
because
it's
all
designed
and
gauged
by
the
use
of
the
facilities
given
and
offered
to
the
passenger
for
its
use.
article
1,
section
8,
clause
3
of
the
federal
constitution,
grants
to
congress
the
power
to
regulate
commerce.
but
we
contend,
and
the
cases
show
this,
that
it
does
not
give
it
the
exclusive
power,
only
the
power
to
regulate
it
in
its
entirety
if
it
sees
fit.
that
congress
has
not
shown
fit
to
preclude
the
states
from
any
reasonable
regulations.
and
as
i
say
the
question
involved
in
this
proceeding
is
whether
we
can
require
congress
to
pay
its
own
way
for
the
use
of
variable
facilities
which
we
are
furnished
to
commerce
and
secondarily
whether
the
dollar
charge
is
reasonable.
in
a
braniff
airlines
case
in
1954,
the
civil
aeronautics
act
of
1938
was
called
into
question
and
this
court
stated
that
this
act
did
not
exclude
or
preempt
the
states
from
passing
or
enacting
reasonable
regulations
and
until
an
act
of
congress
overrides
all
conflicting
legislation,
the
states
can
pass
reasonable
regulations
for
the
use
of
its
facilities.
as
i
stated
the
aviation
facilities
act
has
already
made
the
demands
on
local
government
to
improve
its
airport
system.
and
the
act
further
requires
minimum
standards
that
have
to
be
a
established
by
local
airports,
in
order
to
serve
as
commercial
airports.
in
the
general
motors
case,
we
feel
that
this
is
very
pertinent
on
the
subject
decided
in
1965
and
quoted
it
in
our
opinion,
it
is
not
whether
a
state,
or
whether
commerce
can
be
taxed,
it
is
how
it
can
be
taxed.
our
first
significant
case,
we
feel,
it
was
decided
on
the
use
of
valuable
facilities
furnished
to
commerce
was
back
in
1886
in
the
case
of
huse
versus
glover.
this
involved
the
tax
for
the
use
of
artificially
constructed
navigational
facilities.
although
i
am
not
going
to
quote
extensively
from
this
case,
i
think
the
rationale
of
this
case
requires
as
much
today
as
it
did
it
1886.
the
court
said,
how
the
highways
of
a
state,
whether
on
land
or
by
water
may
be
best
improved
is
a
matter
for
state
determination.
and
it
is
not
the
purpose
of
the
commerce
clause,
the
court
goes
on
to
say,
to
relive
those
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
of
their
just
share
of
the
state
tax
burden.
this
court
stated,
and
it
is
repeatedly
held
that
the
private
inconvenience
must
yield
to
the
public
good.
and
significantly
we
say,
that
the
only
bridge
that
needs
to
be
gapped
between
1886
and
1972,
the
date
that
we
argue
this
case,
is
the
fact
that
the
highways
that
the
runways
of
our
airport
and
indeed
the
highways
of
our
airport.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
i
think
--
i
think
your
honor
that
would
make
a
very
large
difference,
but
we
have
appropriated
this
--
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
we
might
be
stuck
with
crandall,
but
crandall
as
the
respondents
have
rigorously
argued
is
a
mere
departure
tax,
it's
a
mere
tax
to
leave
the
state.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
it's
not
even
based
upon
the
use
of
facility.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
that
is
correct.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
that
is
correct.
in
almost
every
case
that
is
found
throughout
the
airlines'
briefs
your
honor
that
involves
discrimination
or
national
uniformity
is
either
based
upon
the
fact
that
interstate
commerce
is
taxed
is
an
unequal
matter
to
that
of
interstate
commerce.
local
interstate
users
were
not
being
taxed
under
these
use
tax
statutes.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
that
is
correct.
now,
we
have
in
our
stipulations,
a
statement
to
the
effect,
that
the
revenues
to
be
derived
by
the
maximum
tax
levies
of
vanderburgh
county,
indiana
plus
the
revenue
which
we
intend
to
derive
from
this
use
and
service
charge
ordinance,
will
not
even
then
be
sufficient
to
complete
our
overall
improvement
program
in
order
to
comply
with
the
consultant's
report
and
what
we
determine,
the
aviation
facilities
act,
demands
that
we
make
at
the
airport.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
that
is
so,
yes,
but
there
are
cases
that
i've
read
in
the
effect
that
such
a
tax
is
not
constitutional,
if
it's
not
appropriated
for
the
purpose
for
providing
the
improvements
needed
and
enjoyed
by
commerce.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
that
could
be
done,
yes,
unfortunately.
now,
the
aero
mayflower
case
versus
railroad
commission
which
was
decided
in
1947,
cited
at
page
28
of
our
brief,
tells
that
even
where
a
state
has
received
federal
aid,
and
this
runs
to
a
question
that
you
asked
me
mr.
justice
blackmun,
that
even
where
a
state
receives
federal
funds
that
a
gross
receipts
tax
on
motor
carriage
was
valid.
and
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
the
state
was
not
required
to
furnish
facilities
to
commerce
free
of
charge.
and
this
holding
has
been
upheld
by
this
court,
has
been
repeated
by
this
court
in
the
aero
mayflower
case,
the
sprout
case,
the
bingaman
case
all
of
which
we
have
cited
in
our
briefs.
so
we
say
the
incidence
of
the
charge
as
the
respondents
argue
is
not
only
on
the
act
of
enplanement,
but
it
is
on
the
valuable
use
of
airport
facilities
furnished
at
a
great
burden
and
expense
to
vanderburgh
county
taxpayers.
we
submit
your
honor
that
the
use
and
service
charge
of
this
nature
is
not
only
constitutional,
but
equitable
in
nature.
mr.
howard
p.
trockman
i
will
try
to
use
them
as
useful
as
i
can.
first
of
all,
i
would
like
to
comment,
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
on
crandall
versus
nevada.
there
is
no
mention
on
this
case
whatsoever
that
this
is
a
tax
upon
the
use
of
facilities.
it
is
the
tax
upon
the
mere
act
of
departure
upon
the
privilege
of
going
from
one
state
to
the
other.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
1868,
when
this
case
was
decided,
i
am
not
even
sure
that
there
was
a
publicly
maintained
roadway
for
the
use
by
a
stage
coach
travel.
certainly,
the
railroad
tax
filed
with
that
case
was
not
for
the
use
of
publicly
supported
facilities.
and
as
far
as
the
application
of
that
case
is
concerned,
this
was
stricken
and
overruled
by
the
case
of
hendrick
versus
maryland
which
was
decided
in
1915
by
this
court.
and
in
this
case,
it
said
that
with
respect
to
the
holding
of
crandall
versus
nevada
involving
a
tax
which
was
designed
to
prevent
persons
from
leaving
the
state
of
nevada,
that
it
does
not
uphold
that
rationale
because
in
hendrick
versus
maryland,
where
a
tax
was
levied
upon
the
use
of
highways
by
commercial
motor
vehicles,
that
this
involved
the
use
of
valuable
facilities
provided
in
public
expense
and
a
burden
to
the
taxpayers.
and
therefore,
the
holding
of
crandall
was
overruled.
and
in
hendrick
versus
maryland,
which
is
cited
at
pages
29
and
30
of
our
brief,
the
court
stated
that
the
highways
are
public
property
just
like
our
runways
are.
it
is
within
the
power
of
the
state
to
require
those
who
make
special
use
thereof
to
contribute
to
their
cost
in
maintenance.
and
this
court
recognized
in
hendrick
versus
maryland,
the
distinction
between
commercial
motor
vehicles
and
pleasure
cars
and
upheld
the
tax.
the
same
application
applied
in
a
flat
fee
in
the
capitol
greyhound
lines
case.
by
the
way,
in
that
case
as
we
have
in
our
exhibit
c
is
a
list
of
states
which
have
use
taxes.
as
to
the
national
uniformity
argument
which
my
colleague
argues,
i
would
like
to
say
this
that
the
panhandle
eastern
case
strikes
down
this
argument
by
saying
the
power
to
taxes
not
the
power
to
destroy.
and
this
we
believe
is
a
relevant
holding
cited
by
this
court
and
we
feel
that
the
use
tax
levied
in
this
instance
is
fair
and
reasonable
under
the
commerce
clause.
