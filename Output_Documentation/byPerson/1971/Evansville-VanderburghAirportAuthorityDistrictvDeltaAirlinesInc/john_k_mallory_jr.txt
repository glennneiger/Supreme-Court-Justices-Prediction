mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
somewhat
similar
to
the
case
just
argued,
here
on
appeal
from
the
judgment
of
supreme
court
of
new
hampshire,
holding
constitutional
a
new
hampshire
state
statute.
the
appellant
airlines
sought
to
enjoin
enforcement
of
the
statute
which
imposes
on
the
airlines,
this
tax
is
imposed
on
the
airline
not
the
passenger,
imposes
on
the
airline
a
charge
of
$1
per
passenger
enplaned
from
new
hampshire
airports.
the
airlines
contended
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
under
the
constitutional
right
to
travel,
commerce
clause
and
equal
protection
clause.
the
trial
court
in
new
hampshire
transferred
the
case,
including
stipulated
facts
to
the
supreme
court
without
any
--
without
determining
any
issues
as
it
can
do.
the
supreme
court
in
january
29,
1971
held
a
charge,
it
was
charged
on
the
airline,
not
the
passenger
and
that
it
is
not
a
“service
fee”
on
common
carriers
of
passengers
for
hire
on
a
regular
schedule.
that
--
it
held
also
that
the
incidence
of
the
charge
is
on
the
enplanement
of
passengers,
but
it
held
that
enplanement
is
a
wholly
intrastate
event.
it
held
the
statute
constitutional.
the
statute
in
new
hampshire
as
i
have
said
imposes
on
the
airline
a
charge
of
$1
per
passenger
for
all
passengers
enplaning
from
the
new
hampshire
airport.
if
however
a
scheduled
airline
uses
planes
with
a
gross
weight
of
less
than
12500
pounds,
it
charges
50
cents
per
enplaning
passenger.
charter
carriers,
contract
carriers
or
charter
carriers,
not
scheduled
airlines,
of
over
12500
pounds
are
similarly
taxed
and
charter
carriers
with
planes
of
less
than
12500
pounds
do
not
pay.
the
charge
or
tax
on
charter
carriers
ends
when
the
funds
contributed
by
the
states
--
by
the
state
of
new
hampshire
to
the
airports
has
been
repaid.
the
charge
on
schedule
carriers
has
no
terminal
time.
the
collections
from
this
charge
or
tax
are
remitted
to
the
aeronautics
commission,
state
aeronautics
commission
which
distributes
50%
of
the
funds
to
the
state
aeronautical
fund
and
the
remaining
50%
to
the
municipality
or
airport
authority
owning
the
landing
area.
there
is
no
requirement
that
the
municipality
spend
the
monies
received
on
airport
facilities.
under
the
--
the
municipalities
must
place
in
aeronautical
funds,
funds
collected
under
chapter
423
of
the
new
hampshire
laws,
but
the
revenue
collected
under
this
particular
section
that
we
are
talking
about
is
not
collected
under
423,
it
is
collected
under
422.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
it
was
argued
on
the
motion
for
rehearing
your
honor
and
it
is
in
the
appendix
as
i
recall
at
the
very
end,
page
--
starts
at
page
36,
36
a
and
runs
over
to
page
42.
the
particular
argument
is
--
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
it
was
not
raised
prior
to
the
motion
for
rehearing.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
no,
the
new
hampshire
court
simply
says
that
the
money
goes
to
the
aeronautics
fund
which
is
making
the
statement
appear
that
100%
goes
to
the
aeronautics
fund,
that
just
isn't
--
that
isn't
acted
under
the
terms
of
the
statute
itself
which
lays
out
that
50%
goes
to
the
aeronautics
fund
and
50%
to
the
municipality.
again
--
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
there
is
in
the
record
just
the
statement
about
landing
fees
and
rentals
and
that
type
of
state,
but
not
in
detail
your
honor.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
oh!
yes,
i
think
it
does.
i
think
it
does
clearly.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
i
do
not
--
i
can
not
say
that
the
record
specifically
shows
that
i
think
--
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
no,
the
state
aeronautical
fund
under
the
1959
statute,
which
i
will
come
to
in
a
minute,
it
is
an
older
statute,
did
earmark
the
fund
received
under
that
statute
for
paying
off
bonds
and
notes
incurred
at
the
various
airports.
the
1969
statute
which
is
a
one
we
are
talking
about
now
does
not
have
that
same
provision
and
the
state
aeronautical
commission
can
expand
its
funds
for
general
aviation
or
for
improving
navigational
facilities
throughout
the
states
that
type
of
expenditure.
it
does
not
have
to
spend
the
money
on
any
particular
airport,
or
the
airport
from
which
the
funds
were
received.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
no,
then
there
is
a
berlin
and
addition
to
that
berlin
and
laconia.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
the
court
in
new
hampshire,
the
supreme
court,
refused
to
follow
crandall
and
nevada
and
the
passenger
cases,
specifically
stating
that
its
reason
for
not
following
those
were
that
those
involved
a
tax
directly
on
the
passenger
and
not
on
the
carrier
as
the
court
said
was
the
case
here.
it
also
refused
to
follow
the
montana
case
and
distinguished
the
indiana
case
that
we
have
just
argued,
the
evansville
case,
again
on
the
ground
that
there
the
tax
was
on
the
passenger
and
here
it
is
on
the
carrier
and
it
distinguished
the
new
jersey
case
which
had
been
decided
by
the
trial
court
and
the
state
withdrew
its
appeal
on
the
ground
that
there
the
statute
allowed
the
monies
collected
to
go
into
the
general
funds
of
the
cities
which
didn't
own
the
airports.
the
court
noted
that
in
1959,
it
had
rendered
an
advisory
opinion
on
a
similar
statute,
but
one
applicable
only
to
carriers
engaged
in
intrastate
commerce.
it
had
upheld
that
statute
and
had
noted
in
its
opinion,
in
its
advisory
opinion
that
objection
by
anyone
to
the
effect
on
interstate
commerce
was
unlikely
in
view
of
the
aero
mayflower
transit
case,
332
us
and
terrell
against
johnson,
86
new
hampshire.
we
contend
here
that
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
erred
in
holding
that
the
right
to
travel
cases,
including
crandall
do
not
apply
because
the
tax
in
new
hampshire
is
on
the
carrier
rather
than
on
the
passengers.
we
contend
that,
that
is
an
error
of
law
in
determining
that
the
tax
in
new
hampshire
was
on
the
carrier,
not
the
passengers.
we
contend
that
it
also
erred
in
failing
to
follow
the
crandall
line
of
cases
because
of
its
view
that
those
cases
were
merely
based
on
the
theory
of
power
to
tax
as
a
power
to
destroy.
we
submit
that
it
erred
in
holding
that
the
act
of
enplanement,
which
it
found
was
the
incidence
of
taxation,
is
wholly
an
intrastate
event.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
i
--
yes
sir.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
i
would
submit
your
honor,
that
where
the
--
what
i
conceive
be
the
right
to
travel
is
involved,
that
it
is
in
fact
a
metaphysical.
that
here
a
state
in
imposing
a
tax,
but
in
this
case
on
the
carrier
measured
by
the
number
of
passengers
but
i
think
that
it
should
be
considered
as
one
directly
on
the
passenger
when
its
the
tax
of
this
kind,
where
it
can
where
doubt
--
it
do
that.
i
think
that
it
clearly
has
the
power,
that
it
is
exercising
the
power
to
control
and
to
some
extent
suppress
the
right
to
travel
or
which
is
a
right
that
i
believe
has
more
than
just
--
is
based
on
more
than
just
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
oh!
i
concede
that
it
doesn't
have
the
right
to
travel
on
state's
expense,
yes.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
indeed,
your
honor,
i
urge
that
they
can
and
i
think
that
the
cases
cited
in
all
of
the
briefs
that
have
been
filed
show
the
vast
number
of
ways
in
which
the
state
or
a
community
can
raise
money.
yesterday,
the
question
of
landing
fees
came
up,
clearly
the
state
of
an
airport
can
impose
landing
fees
that
will
raise
a
substantial
amount
of
money.
the
(inaudible)
can
certainly
be
increased
and
raise
money
and
both
proceeds
--
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
i
certainly
do,
i
certainly
do.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
--it
is
bound
to
be
ultimately
attached
onto
the
--
in
some
fashion
to
the
price
of
transportation,
but
it
is
not
attached
sort
of
dollar
or
penny
for
penny
on
the
head
of
the
person
traveling
from
for
example
laconia
to
boston.
the
laconia
airport
which
i
am
fairly
familiar
is
a
very
small
airport.
it
could
stand
i
am
sure
a
great
deal
of
improvement
and
could
probably
would
be
a
fairly
small
amount
of
traffic.
that
could
justify
a
very
high
enplanement
charge
without
that
charge
being
excessive.
it
would
certainly
burden
travel
between
laconia
and
boston
if
it
did
that.
now,
a
gross
receipts
and
a
properly
apportioned
gross
receipts
tax
or
properly
apportioned
income
tax,
some
other
type
of
personal
property
tax
on
airlines
that
would
be
borne
by
passengers
traveling
throughout
the
united
states,
instead
of
simply
borne
by
those
traveling,
seeking
to
leave
laconia
and
get
to
boston
would
be
a
very
different
thing,
and
it
would
also
be
under
the
regulatory
control
of
the
civil
aeronautics
board
which
has
the
obligation
and
the
power
to
allocate
routes
and
to
regulate
these,
so
they
can
carry
out
its
purpose
in
seeing
that
the
nation
is
served
by
commercial
carriers
rather
than
just
a
particular
route.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
view
a
landing
as
a
fee
for
the
use
of
a
airport
and
i
think
that
basically
that's
what
it
is
rather
than
--
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
it
is
certainly
one
of
the
acts
that
people
do
after
they
have
used
the
airport,
they
get
out
after
they
have
used
the
terminal,
they
are
using
the
runway.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
yes
sir,
they
are
using
it.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
enplanement
by
definition
is
the
act
of
boarding
the
airplane
with
the
intent
to
depart.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
for
the
purpose
of
departure,
not
with
the
intent
to
depart,
but
the
purpose
of
departure.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
i
think
you
are
engaged
in
enplanement
when
you
board
the
aircraft
you
honor
for
the
propose
of
departure.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
yes
you
are,
you
are.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
you
are,
indeed
you
are
and
you
are
using
it
when
you
go
there
for
any
purpose.
under
these
taxes,
if
you
go
to
the
airport,
have
your
ticket,
sit
and
wait,
the
plane
is
canceled
for
some
reason,
there
is
no
tax.
if
you
board
the
plane
and
it
takes
off,
there
is
a
tax.
i
do
not
know
what
happens
with
tax
under
those
conditions.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
i
didn't
mean
to
say,
your
honor,
that
the
cab
allocates
funds.
they
allocate
routes
and
have
the
obligation
of
determining
rates
that
will
resolved
in
a
serve
--
in
a
airline
service
throughout
the
country
rather
than
the
local
government
being
--
or
a
state
government
being
able
to
impose
a
tax
or
a
charge
that
will
influence
or
it
can
influence
the
fares
to
such
an
extent
that
it
restricts
the
right
to
travel
from
that
state.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
i
think
the
airline
suggests
some
type
of
uniform
charge.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
by
--
well,
by
a
uniform
charge
that
would
be
imposed,
that
would
flow
back
to
facilities
that
need
the
money
rather
than
publicly
rather
than
a
uniform
charge
by
facilities
themselves.
that
would
avoid
the
problem
of
the
differing
amounts
and
the
differing
incidence
of
taxation.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
your
honor,
i
say
that
higher
landing
fees
are
a
way
in
which
the
airports
can
raise
money
without
in
my
judgment
violating
the
constitution.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
i
do
not
think
i
have
a
constitutional
argument
your
honor,
no.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
they
certainly
do
not,
your
honor.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
when
you
say
i
am
suggesting
that
there
be
a
--
if
it
be
deemed
desirable
to
do
it
this
way,
that
the
federal
government
--
indeed
the
secretary
of
transportation,
secretary
wolfe
(ph)
at
one
point
suggested
to
the
house
ways
and
means
committee,
a
bill
under
which
congress
would
authorize
the
states
to
impose
a
reasonable
charge
on
enplaning
passengers
if
they
could
get
the
airline
serving
that
airport
to
agree
to
that
charge.
he
talked
in
terms
of
$1
charge,
then
it
would
be
a
uniform
charge.
now
i
think
that
the
question
of
obtaining
uniformity
here
is
extremely
important
in
this
--
in
any
way
of
raising
money
on
the
--
through
any
kind
of
enplaning
tax.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
under
my
proposal
it
would
be,
yes.
the
charge
would
be
the
same.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
that
--
it
may
vary
very
greatly
and
the
amount
of
the
money
that
would
then
flow
back
to
the
san
francisco
airport
may
--
would
vary,
would
definitely
vary
greatly
from
that
flows
to
laconia.
to
go
back
to
the
new
hampshire
court’s
refusal
to
follow
crandall
because
it
stated
that
here
the
tax
was
on
the
carrier,
not
passenger.
we
believe
that
the
court
--
the
court
also
found
in
new
hampshire
that
the
act,
there
was
a
service
charge
as
i
said.
i
think
a
fair
reading
of
the
court's
opinion
indicates
that
its
finding,
that
it
was
a
service
charge,
depends
greatly,
in
substantial
measure
on
its
finding
that
the
act
of
enplanement
is
a
wholly
intrastate
act,
which
we
contend
is
wrong
under
the
cases.
now
the
stipulation
in
new
hampshire
again
shows
that
a
majority
of
the
users
are
not
taxed
and
it
also
shows
that
the
use
by
the
minority
who
are
taxed
is
substantially
no
different
from
that
of
the
majority
who
are
not
taxed.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
because
--
excuse
me.
higher
landing
fees
at
all
airports
simply
go
into
the
cost
of
operating
an
airline.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
they
do
not
--
excuse
me
i
am
sorry.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
that
goes
into
the
general
cost
of
operating
of
the
airlines
--
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
--
and
the
fee
--
and
the
fare
from
laconia
to
boston
is
not
based
entirely
or
even
in
large
measure
on
the
landing
fee
at
the
laconia
airport.
those
costs
are
then
--
you
adjust
your
fares
to
recoup
those
costs.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
it's
going
to
cost
people
more
to
travel,
but
it's
not
going
to
cost
-–
it's
not
going
to
be
a
direct
burden
on
the
passenger
from
laconia
to
boston.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
by
the
--
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
i
am
sorry.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
i
am
not
--
well,
once
you
make
the
judgment
that
they
shouldn't
be
paying
it,
i
think
that
it
would
follow,
your
conclusion
would
follow.
i
think
that
any
of
the
costs,
or
right
now
the
costs
at
laconia
on
landing
fees
of
$50
for
fairchild
227
and
$75
for
dc-9.
now
those
costs
are
not
just
divided
by
the
number
of
passengers
carried
from
the
airport
in
new
hampshire.
if
that's
wrong,
it's
wrong,
but
it's
certainly
not
done
that
way.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
do
your
honor.
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
perhaps
another
lawyer
will
be
arguing
the
landing
--
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
--
but
i
am
not
prepared
to
--
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
that
the
tax
--
no,
well
it's
more
than
that
one
one
word
your
honor.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
the
fact
that
it's
a
tax
on
enplanement,
i
think
it
takes
it
out
of
the
use
tax
category
in
the
indiana
case.
the
fact
that
the
taxable
advantage,
the
act
of
enplanement,
i
submit
brings
it
under
crandall
against
nevada,
the
passenger
cases,
and
a
number
of
other
cases,
and
indeed
brings
into
play
the
--
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
the
landing
fee?
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
as
far
as
i
am
prepared
to
say
today,
as
i
view
the
landing
fee,
it's
alright,
yes.
as
i
say,
some
other
lawyer
maybe
here
arguing
the
constitutionality
of
the
landing
fee
with
you,
it's
fine,
but
i
am
prepared
to
say
that
landing
fee
is
alright
under
my
view
of
the
constitutionality.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
it's
not
a
direct
paid
tax
--
it's
not
a
direct
tax
on
the
passenger.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
the
enplaning
fee
is
a
direct
tax
on
the
passenger.
the
fact
--
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
well
--
i
am
coming
to
that
the
--
if
i
may
your
honor,
see
in
the
passenger
cases,
in
crandall,
in
henderson
against
mayor
of
new
york,
all
of
those
were
taxes
in
which
it
was
argued
that
the
tax
was
on
the
carrier.
there
is
no
--
in
the
crandall
case
the
tax,
in
fact,
was
on
the
passenger,
but
it
was
argued
that
it
was
a
tax
on
the
carrier.
in
the
passenger
cases,
it
was
a
tax
on
the
master
or
the
owner.
in
henderson
against
the
mayor
of
new
york,
it
was
a
tax
on
the
master
or
the
owner.
in
the
shay
wong
(ph)
case
it
was
the
tax
on
the
master.
in
people
versus
compagnie
générale
transatlantique,
it
was
a
tax
on
the
owner.
in
each
one
of
those
cases,
the
court
was
met
with
the
argument
that
here
is
a
tax
on
the
carrier,
it's
not
the
passenger.
it's
a
use
tax
or
it's
a
tax
on
the
privilege
of
doing
business.
in
each
one
of
those
cases
the
court
looked
through
that,
and
specifically
held
that
as
a
legal
matter,
as
a
constitutional
matter
a
tax
of
this
type
on
the
carrier
measured
by
flat
rate
per
head
on
the
passenger
is
to
be
viewed
for
constitutional
purposes
as
a
tax
directly
on
the
passenger.
now
the
supreme
court
of
new
hampshire
ignored
those
cases.
it
didn't
--
they
were
brief,
it
did
not
discuss
them
at
all
in
its
opinion.
in
the
passenger
cases,
chief
justice
taney
in
dissenting,
but
in
discussing
at
the
interstate,
an
intrastate
tax,
a
tax
on
citizens
moving
from
one
state
to
another
was
also
covered
in
those
statutes
and
finding
that
that
was
unconstitutional
specifically
dealt
with
whether
or
not
a
tax
of
this
type
was
one
to
be
viewed
is
on
the
carrier
or
the
passenger.
and
he
held
that
it
was
stated
that,
it
was
on
holding
that
it
was
to
be
viewed
as
a
tax
on
the
passenger.
in
henderson
against
new
york,
the
state
was
specifically
trying
to
avoid
the
holding
in
the
passenger
cases.
and
they
made
it
absolutely
clear
that
the
charge
was
not
on
the
passenger,
but
on
the
master
gave
them
an
alternative
to
post
a
bond
or
pay
$1.50
for
each
passenger.
new
york
argued
in
that
case
that
the
tax,
the
act
i
am
sorry,
the
act
to
be
passed
now
by
the
court
does
not
impose
a
tax
on
the
passenger.
the
act
--
the
state
also
argued
that
the
act
cannot
be
tortured
into
an
indirect
mode
of
imposing
a
tax
or
duty
upon
the
passenger
as
such.
the
court
noted
that
argument
and
specifically
stated,
in
whatever
language
a
statute
maybe
framed
its
purpose
must
be
determined
by
its
natural
reasonable
effect,
and
if
it
is
apparent
that
the
object
of
this
statute
is
judged
by
that
criterion,
is
to
compel
the
owners
of
vessels
to
pay
sum
of
money
for
each
passenger
brought
by
them
from
a
foreign
shore
and
landed
at
the
port
of
new
york,
it
is
as
much
a
tax
on
the
passengers,
if
collected
from
them,
or
a
tax
on
the
vessel
owner
for
the
exercise
of
the
right
of
landing
their
passengers
in
that
city,
as
was
the
statute
held
void
in
the
passenger
cases.
in
crandall
against
nevada,
the
same
argument
was
made,
that
it
was
a
tax
on
the
carrier.
in
fact
there
the
statute
i
think
was
fairly
clear
but
it
was
on
--
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
and
private
aviation
as
well
and
so
on?
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
well,
i
would
suspect
that
under
those
views,
the
tax
would
probably
be
excessive
that
if
in
fact
now.
once
you
impose
the
tax
generally
it's
going
to
be
a
much
smaller
amount.
in
indiana,
for
example,
you
had
85,000
take
offs
and
landings
by
civil
aviation
and
only
14
by
commercial
aviation.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
in
this
case
rested
its
decision
entirely
on
the
commerce
clause
and
declared
the
ordinance
invalid
under
the
commerce
clause.
it
filed
the
validity
there
and
stated
that
it
did
not
therefore
reach
the
other
constitutional
issues
in
the
case
that
had
been
decided
by
the
trial
court.
the
trial
court
had
decided
the
ordinance
invalid
under
the
constitutional
right
to
travel,
the
fourteenth
amendment,
privileges
and
immunities
clause
and
equal
protection
clause
and
it
also
found
it
invalid
under
the
indiana
constitution.
we
contend
unconstitutionality
under
all
of
these
and
particularly
under
the
constitutional
right
to
travel.
however
since
i
am
seeking
affirmance
of
the
indiana
supreme
court
decision,
i
intend
to
limit
or
to
rely
principally
or
discuss
principally
the
commerce
clause
decision
by
it.
the
crucial
issue,
i
submit
under
the
commerce
clause
is
whether
or
not,
this
is
a
use
tax.
the
case
has
been
argued
and
i
think
briefed
by
the
other
side
on
the
assumption
that
it
is
a
use
tax.
the
cases
it
cites,
the
highway
use
cases
principally
are
use
tax
cases.
it
is
my
submission
to
this
court
that
the
tax
is
not
a
use
tax
case.
it
is
not
a
use
charge.
it
is
not
a
service
charge.
rather
it
is
a
charge
or
a
tax
on
the
passenger
for
the
act
of
enplanement.
that
is,
it
is
a
charge
on
the
passenger
for
the
act
of
boarding
the
aircraft
for
the
purpose
of
departure
88%
of
the
people
who
are
enplaning
at
this
airport
or
enplaning
for
an
out
of
state
place.
the
question
and
issue
of
whether
or
not
this
is
a
use
tax
has
been
before
the
court’s
on
four
states
and
it
has
been
present
in
these
cases
since
these
ordinances
gained
popularity
some
four
years
ago.
it
has
been
and
was
discussed
directly
before
the
trial
court
and
the
indiana
supreme
court.
in
this
case,
they
decided
that
it
was
not
a
use
tax.
it
was
not
a
charge
for
use
and
that
it
was
dependent
solely
on
the
act
of
enplanement.
it
was
before
the
montana
supreme
court
in
a
very
similar
case
except
that
in
the
montana
case,
the
charge
was
nominally
levied
on
the
air
carrier
rather
than
on
the
passenger.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
no,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
it
depends
on
the
incidence
of
the
tax.
the
taxable
event
set
forth
in
the
ordinance
or
the
statute.
and
the
taxable
event
set
forth
here
is
not
use
of
the
airport
facilities
by
the
passenger.
it’s
the
act
of
enplanement,
that
is
boarding
the
aircraft
for
the
purpose
of
departure
under
the
ordinance
itself.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
but
when
you
say
similar
tax,
i
have
some
problems,
but
where
certainly,
one
can
conceive
of
the
airport
board
putting
up
the
turnstile
as
you
enter
the
airport
terminal
that
all
users
have
to
put
in
a
dime
or
25
cents
or
whatever
and
walk
through
the
turnstile
to
use
the
airport
terminal.
i
think
i
would
have
a
much
different
argument
and
a
much
harder
argument
than
i
have
here.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
i
would
think
that
that
would
be
quite
clearly
unconstitutional
your
honor
under
the
large
number
of
cases
that
say
that
state
cannot
tax
the
act
of
transportation
which
is
really
the
basis
for
the
cases
that
we
rely
on
here
under
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
no,
i
would
not
differentiate
that
from
the
act
of
deplaning,
your
honor.
i
am
differentiating
it
from
the
act
of
the
passenger
using
the
airport
terminal
on
which
this
tax
is
not
levied.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
i
would
want
to
see
the
ordinance.
i
do
not
think
that
it
would
be
for
the
use
of
the
airport
more
clearly.
i
think
that
it
would
then
for
the
act
of
landing
in
an
aircraft.
it
will
depend
on
the
statute
of
the
ordinance,
obviously.
but
i
think
it
would
be
for
the
act
of
landing
in
an
aircraft
there.
i
think
this
question
raised
a
point
that
should
be
emphasized
here.
in
arguing
the
unconstitutionality
of
this
ordinance
or
of
a
statute
similar
to
this,
i
am
not
contending
and
i
do
not
want
to
be
misunderstood
that
there
is
no
way
that
the
airport
board
can
increase
its
income
or
can
make
as
the
other
side
says
can
make
interstate
commerce
pay
its
fair
share.
the
case
is
a
liegemen
under
which
states
and
localities
have
made
interstate
commerce
pay
its
fair
share.
they
are
properly
apportioned
gross
receipts
taxes,
properly
apportioned
net
income
taxes,
in
this
case,
we
have
landing
fees,
in
this
case,
we
have
rentals
and
there
are
privilege
taxes.
there
are
any
number
of
ways
that
the
state
can
make
interstate
commerce
pay
its
fair
share.
so,
i
am
contending
that
these
ordinances,
with
the
incidence
on
the
tax
of
enplanement
or
invalid
as
a
tax
on
direct
tax
on
interstate
commerce
and
that
the
dangers
of
such
a
tax
in
multiple
taxation
emphasize
the
burden
that
will
be
placed
on
interstate
commerce.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
your
honor,
you
are
saying
that
the
state
can
–-
with
all
respect,
it
seems
to
me
you
are
saying
that
the
amount
of
money
that
the
state
can
raise
would
be
the
same
under
the
two
circumstances.
but
it
seems
to
me
the
first
question
and
it
seems
to
me
spector
teaches
this
and
a
number
of
other
freeman
against
hewit
and
mcleod
against
dilworth
case,
that
the
first
thing
that
one
has
to
consider
is
not
whether
the
state
may
validly
raise
money
in
some
fashion
on
interstate
commerce
but
what
the
constitutional
channel
through
which
it
attempts
to
raise
it
is
and
whether
that
constitutional
channel
is,
in
fact,
constitutional
or
unconstitutional.
and
what
i
might
--
statement
about
the
turnstiles
was
not
that
enplaning
passengers
would
have
to
drop
the
dime
or
quarter
in
the
turnstile.
it
was
that
all
users
would
have
to
do
it
and
that
the
act
of
taxation.
the
taxable
event
was
not
enplaning
in
interstate
commerce
but
on
the
use
of
the
airport.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
oh
yes!
yes,
your
honor.
they
would
have
to
go
through
the
turnstile.
and
they
would
have
to
pay
for
the
use
of
the
airport
terminal.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
in
other
words,
your
honor,
if
the
ordinance
read
that
landing
fees
will
be
increased
by
one
dollar
per
enplaning
passenger,
there
i
think
that
i
come
back
that
the
taxable
event
is
the
active
enplanement.
and
under
the
--
basically
from
crandall
against
nevada
to
the
extent
that
that
may
be
viewed
as
a
commerce
clause
case
right
after
the
–-
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
so
long
as
the
landing
fee
depends
on
the
weight
of
the
plane,
i
have
no
problem
with
it.
that
is
the
type
of
use
tax
that
has
been
upheld
where
the
use
of
the
highways,
the
truck
depends
on
the
weight,
or
the
amount
paid
by
the
trucker
depends
on
the
weight
of
the
truck
and
so
on.
but
anytime
the
tax
is
a
tax
that
is
on
the
passenger,
as
this
one
is
measured
on
the
carrier
measured
by
a
flat
amount
per
head
by
the
passenger.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
your
honor,
that
gets
into
the
--
obviously,
the
airlines
passed
on
charges
but
where
the
charge
is
a
dollar
or
two
dollars
a
head
or
whatever
it
may
be
from
a
particular
airport,
that
is
passed
on
direct
from
that
airport.
and
it
removes
the
ability
of
the
carrier
and
from
the
cab,
the
idea
of
apportioning
its
rates
in
such
a
way
as
to
serve
aviation
generally.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
i
suppose
if
one
could
argue
that
that
would
be
excessive
and
i
suppose
that
one
could
argue
that
it
was
in
fact
a
tax
on
enplanement
and
therefore
unconstitutional.
as
i
said
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
on
the
turnstile
question,
i
do
not
say
that
that
is
clearly
constitutional.
all
i
say
on
that
is
that
i
have
a
very
different
argument
and
what
i
would
conceive
to
be
a
much
more
difficult
argument
than
i
have
in
this
case.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
it
really
would
if
you
have
the
charge
–-
if
you
have
a
toll
charge
on
an
access
rather
than
one
has
to
use
to
get
into
the
airport.
clearly,
that
is
a
much
harder
case
and
a
much
different
case.
now,
on
the
question
of
the
operating
need,
mr.
trockman
yesterday
stated
that
the
airport
board
had
an
operating
deficit
and
i
do
not
contest
that.
i
think
it
might
be
well
to
put
it
in
some
perspective.
the
total
operating
income
in
1967
of
the
board
was
some
$268,900.00.
that
was
raised
about
equally
by
and
this
is
exclusive
of
property
taxes
in
the
area.
that’s
about
equally
from
aviation
sources
and
non-aviation
sources
(inaudible)
that
was
the
total
operating.
the
total
operating
disbursements
exclusive
of
bond
retirement
of
a
$166,000.00
leaving
an
operating
profit
exclusive
of
bond
retirement
of
approximately
$100,000.00.
the
bond
retirement
cost
was
$182,000.00.
incidentally,
this
is
shown,
these
figures
are
taken
from
paragraph
25
in
appendix
page
59
and
from
exhibit
5
to
the
stipulation
of
facts
which
was
not
printed.
the
only
figure
taken
from
exhibit
5
is
the
operating
disbursements
and
the
breakdown
of
the
income
between
aviation
and
non-aviation
sources.
as
i
said,
the
bond
retirement
costs
were
$182,000.00.
the
operating
profit
exclusive
of
the
bond
retirement
was
about
$100,000.00.
you
had
a
deficit
of
something
less
than
a
$100,000.00
including
the
bond
retirement
in
the
operating
expenses.
i
do
not
have
the
figure
in
the
record
but
the
1970
annual
report
of
the
airport
board
shows
that
about
20.56%
of
the
general
fund
revenues
come
from
property
taxes.
now,
that
does
not
include
the
amount
that
goes
of
property
taxes
that
goes
into
the
building
fund
for
the
airport.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
nothing
has
been
raised
from
the
dollar
a
head
tax,
sir.
the
lower
court
enjoined,
the
trial
court
enjoined
that
in
the
collection
and
the
supreme
court
of
course
of
indiana
affirmed
the
trial
court’s
decision.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
i
have
none.
the
court
raised
and
asked
questions
about
yesterday.
my
brother
made
a
response
saying
that
there
was
an
operating
deficit.
i
said
that
--
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
it
is
still
a
deficit
after
bond
retirement.
yes,
your
honor,
of
something
less
than
a
$100,000.00.
coming
back
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
is
a
use
tax
and
therefore
a
sense
governed
or
controlled
by
the
highway
use
tax
cases.
the
indiana
supreme
court
responded
quite
directly
to
the
airport
board’s
argument
that
this
charge
is
a
service
charge
for
the
use
of
facilities
and
stated
that
there
is
no
question
that
the
incidence
of
the
tax
imposed
by
ordinance
33
falls
on
interstate
commerce.
and
it
also
held
that
the
tax
is
on
the
active
enplanement.
focused
quite
squarely
on
the
issue
of
whether
the
act
of
enplanement
was
reasonably
related
to
the
use
of
airport
facilities
and
held
that
and
i
quote
that,
“it
is
clear
that
the
tax
imposed
by
ordinance
33
is
not
reasonably
related
to
the
use
of
the
facilities
which
benefit
from
the
tax.”
trial
court
made
similar
findings
stating
that
not
withstanding
the
name
given
the
charge
nor
the
stated
justification
for
the
charge,
its
operating
incidence
is
solely
on
the
act
of
enplanement.
the
trial
court
also
made
findings
that
the
use
of
the
airport
by
the
minority
who
were
taxed
was
no
different
in
quality
or
amount
than
the
use
by
the
majority
who
were
not
taxed.
that
it
does
depend
on
the
act
of
enplanement
and
not
use,
i
think
it
is
clear
from
the
reading
of
the
ordinance
itself.
it
imposes
what
is
called
in
the
ordinance
a
use
and
service
charge
of
$1.00
per
each
passenger
enplaning
any
commercial
aircraft
operated
from
the
dress
memorial
airport.
it
imposes
on
the
airline
the
obligation
to
collect
that
tax
and
remit
it
to
the
state
based
on
the
number
of
enplaning
passengers
times
the
$1.00
charge.
the
tax
as
the
trial
court
and
the
supreme
court
noted
is
not
imposed
on
all
users
only
on
a
minority.
while
those
findings
on
the
discriminatory
nature
of
the
charge
form
the
basis
of
the
court’s
holding
in
part
of
the
basis
of
the
court’s
holding
under
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
also
its
holding
of
invalidity
under
the
nevada
constitution.
the
arbitrary
nature
of
the
charge
or
selection
of
passengers
–-
selection
of
users
who
will
be
charged
also
formed
its
basis
or
partly
formed
its
basis
for
the
finding
that
it
was
not
a
use
charge.
i
submit
that
the
fact
that
the
funds
collected
under
this
tax
go
into
the
airport
board
funds
for
the
use
on
the
airport
does
not
make
this
a
use
tax.
it
is
clearly
a
relevant
consideration
for
the
court
to
consider
in
determining
whether
or
not
it
is
a
use
tax
but
it
is
not
decisive.
and
i
think
that
mccarroll
against
dixie
greyhound
309
u.s.
points
that
out.
the
court
there
stated
that
it
is
not
enough
that
the
tax
when
collected
is
expended
upon
the
state’s
highways.
it
must
appear
on
the
face
of
the
statute
of
the
demonstrable
where
the
taxes
laid
is
measured
by
or
has
some
fair
relationship
to
the
use
of
the
highways
to
which
the
charge
is
made.
going
back
to
a
minute
on
this
question
of
what
the
funds
are
to
be
used
for,
that
argument
indeed
was
made
in
crandall
against
nevada.
there
at
page
38,
“the
state
argued
that
the
state
makes
roads,
keeps
them
in
repair,
and
must
in
some
way
be
paid
in
order
to
be
able
to
do
all
of
this.”
and
what
difference
does
it
make,
whether
it
is
to
be
paid
by
a
tax
of
$1.00
on
each
passenger
or
by
the
same
sum
collected
at
a
toll
gate,
or
by
gross
sum
for
a
license?
the
court
in
crandall
indicated
that
it
made
a
good
bit
of
difference
as
to
whether
it
was
constitutional
to
tax
the
passenger
at
$1.00
a
head
for
leaving
the
state
even
though
he
had
obviously
used
the
roads,
and
the
state
had
to
build
and
keep
them
repaired.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
no,
i
don’t
believe
that’s
fact
your
honor.
it
was
imposed
on
passengers
in
departing
or
leaving
the
state,
as
i
recall,
by
stage
coach
railroad
and
it
had
another
list
of
things.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
because
the
state
did
not
construct
the
railroad.
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that
is
quite
right.
but
they
clearly
had
constructed
the
roads
over
which
the
stage
coach
passengers
ran.
in
crandall,
it
is
my
recollection,
your
honor,
that
crandall
was
a
stage
coach
operator
or
owner
who
was
contesting
the
statute.
incidentally,
the
use
of
the
proceeds
was
argued
in
the
henderson
against
the
mayor
of
new
york
case
where
two-thirds
of
the
funds
went
to
the
commissioner
of
immigration
for
inspection
and
to
build
wards
and
warehouses.
in
the
passenger
case
part
of
the
funds
went
to
a
marine
hospital
in
people
against
compagnie
generale
transatlantique,
the
sums
went
to
the
commission
of
immigration
for
inspection
expenses
and
the
remainder
was
remitted
to
the
united
states
treasury.
the
states
at
that
time
were
seeking
many
ways
to
validate
this
type
of
tax.
and
in
each
one,
the
argument
would
be
made
that
the
funds
were
being
used
to
recompense
the
state
for
expenses
made
by
it
in
tearing
out
its
proper
functions.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
well,
i
would
deal
with
that
in
two
ways,
your
honor.
first,
it’s
not
a
commerce
clause
but
in
fact
i
don’t
think
it
is
the
most
important
ground.
it
is
the
question
under
article
1,
section
10
of
the
article.
secondly,
i
deal
with
it
by
saying
that
there
the
court
quite
properly
found
that
it
was
a
use
tax
and
was
not
a
tax
on
a
passenger
for
engaging
in
interstate
commerce.
and
i
think
that
the
sum
of
these
--
that
these
passengers
are
engaging
in
interstate
commerce.
when
they
board
the
plane
for
the
purpose
of
departure,
i
think
it’s
fairly
obvious
under
the
michigan-wisconsin
pipe
line
case
where
the
gathering
of
gas
was
considered
a
tax
directly
on
interstate
commerce.
i
think
the
same
thing
is
here.
the
same
thing
is
present
here.
i
think
in
the
joseph
against
carter
&
weeks
which
was
a
loading
of
freight
case
and
baltimore
&
ohio
against
birch
which
was
the
same
type
of
case.
the
richfield
oil
case
where
the
court
said
the
commerce
begins
no
later
than
delivery
of
oil
into
the
vessel.
all
of
those,
i
think
indicate
very
strongly
that
the
passenger
boarding
the
plane
for
the
purpose
of
departure
which
is
what
enplanement
means,
that
the
passenger
is
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
and
the
tax
that’s
being
imposed
on
him
is
a
tax
imposed
on
him
for
the
privilege
of
engaging
in
that
act.
and
the
cases
that
talk
about
a
tax
on
a
passenger
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
or
on
a
passenger,
or
on
freight
that’s
being
loaded
or
has
been
loaded
for
interstate
commerce
and
striking
down
those
statutes
are
extremely
numerous.
basically,
you
can
probably
start
under
the
commerce
clause.
i
think
that
basically
you
can
start
to
submit
some
of
the
language
in
the
passenger
cases.
some
of
the
language
by
two
justices
in
the
crandall
case
plus
the
perry
case
which
just
has
a
black
has
a
statement
saying
that
you
can’t
pass
passengers
and
the
people
and
persons
engaged
in
interstate
commerce.
i
think
the
justice
or
chief
justice
taney’s
dissenting
opinion
in
the
passenger
cases
where
he
was
talking
about
not
aliens
but
persons
who
were
traveling
by
ship
from
one
state
to
another
and
who
were
taxed
at
the
rate
of
25
cents
a
head
for
departing
the
vessel
in
the
state
of
new
york.
his
comment
about
those
passengers
is
very
strong
in
saying
that
the
state
cannot
tax
those.
and
that
dissent
was
later,
i
believe,
quoted
in
crandall
and
has
been
re-quoted
in
cases
as
recently
as
gaston,
i
think,
in
the
shapiro
case,
shapiro
against
thompson
as
well.
in
the
minnesota
rate
cases,
the
court
said,
the
states
cannot
tax
interstate
commerce
either
by
a
laying
a
tax
upon
the
business
which
constitutes
such
commerce
with
the
privilege
of
engaging
in
it
or
upon
persons
of
property
in
transit
in
interstate
commerce.
i
would
also
submit
that
the
fact
that
here
the
incident
is
the
act
of
enplanement
rather
than
use
by
the
passenger,
lends
itself
to
considerable
different
multiple
local
taxation
involving
different
incidents
of
travel
and
also
differing
amounts.
as
to
the
amount
of
the
tax,
the
evansville
airport
board
has
stated
here
on
that
brief
in
an
argument
that
even
this
$1.00
is
not
enough
to
cover
the
cost
of
their
plan
of
improvements.
i
do
not
dispute
that
at
all.
indeed,
as
the
taxes
grow,
as
this
$1.00
becomes
more
the
ingenuity
of
an
airport
board
to
plan
other
improvements
can
make
a
charge
of
almost
any
amount
not
excessive.
so
i
think
that
it
is
quite
obvious
to
anticipate
that
there
will
be
taxes
if
this
ordinance
is
allowed
to
stand,
there
will
be
taxes
by
most
local
airports
in
this
country.
the
taxes,
i
think
will
vary
in
amount
and
i
think
that
they
will
vary
as
to
the
incident
of
taxation.
i
think
some
will
be
for
deplaning
passengers,
some
will
be
for
stopover
passengers,
and
some
would
be
for
in-transit
passengers.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
that
is
its
fundamental
function,
your
honor.
i
think
some
have
gotten
away
from
that
a
little
bit
with
fancy
restaurants
and
things
of
that
nature.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
i
am
not
sure
if
they
could,
your
honor.
i
must
confess
that
i
probably
can
not
answer
--
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
no,
not
just
because
there
might
be
interstate
passengers.
i
think
that
it
would
depend
on
a
great
deal
on
the
incidence
of
taxation.
if
it
were
done
by
a
toll,
say
to
the
access
road,
into
the
airport
and
for
the
use
of
that
road
that
may
have
--
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
in
air
freight
and
so
on
does
not
bear
any
of
the
obligation.
it
us
just
passengers.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
i
would
have
some
problem
with
that
by
excluding
freight,
i
am
sure.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
no.
well,
yes
because
it
discriminates
against
the
passengers
as
opposed
to
making
interstate
commerce
pay
for
the
freight
that
it
is
carrying
as
well.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
i
am
sorry?
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
but
it
does
not
pay
any
tax
to
construct
the
airport.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
somewhat
similar
to
the
case
just
argued,
here
on
appeal
from
the
judgment
of
supreme
court
of
new
hampshire,
holding
constitutional
a
new
hampshire
state
statute.
the
appellant
airlines
sought
to
enjoin
enforcement
of
the
statute
which
imposes
on
the
airlines,
this
tax
is
imposed
on
the
airline
not
the
passenger,
imposes
on
the
airline
a
charge
of
$1
per
passenger
enplaned
from
new
hampshire
airports.
the
airlines
contended
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
under
the
constitutional
right
to
travel,
commerce
clause
and
equal
protection
clause.
the
trial
court
in
new
hampshire
transferred
the
case,
including
stipulated
facts
to
the
supreme
court
without
any
--
without
determining
any
issues
as
it
can
do.
the
supreme
court
in
january
29,
1971
held
a
charge,
it
was
charged
on
the
airline,
not
the
passenger
and
that
it
is
not
a
“service
fee”
on
common
carriers
of
passengers
for
hire
on
a
regular
schedule.
that
--
it
held
also
that
the
incidence
of
the
charge
is
on
the
enplanement
of
passengers,
but
it
held
that
enplanement
is
a
wholly
intrastate
event.
it
held
the
statute
constitutional.
the
statute
in
new
hampshire
as
i
have
said
imposes
on
the
airline
a
charge
of
$1
per
passenger
for
all
passengers
enplaning
from
the
new
hampshire
airport.
if
however
a
scheduled
airline
uses
planes
with
a
gross
weight
of
less
than
12500
pounds,
it
charges
50
cents
per
enplaning
passenger.
charter
carriers,
contract
carriers
or
charter
carriers,
not
scheduled
airlines,
of
over
12500
pounds
are
similarly
taxed
and
charter
carriers
with
planes
of
less
than
12500
pounds
do
not
pay.
the
charge
or
tax
on
charter
carriers
ends
when
the
funds
contributed
by
the
states
--
by
the
state
of
new
hampshire
to
the
airports
has
been
repaid.
the
charge
on
schedule
carriers
has
no
terminal
time.
the
collections
from
this
charge
or
tax
are
remitted
to
the
aeronautics
commission,
state
aeronautics
commission
which
distributes
50%
of
the
funds
to
the
state
aeronautical
fund
and
the
remaining
50%
to
the
municipality
or
airport
authority
owning
the
landing
area.
there
is
no
requirement
that
the
municipality
spend
the
monies
received
on
airport
facilities.
under
the
--
the
municipalities
must
place
in
aeronautical
funds,
funds
collected
under
chapter
423
of
the
new
hampshire
laws,
but
the
revenue
collected
under
this
particular
section
that
we
are
talking
about
is
not
collected
under
423,
it
is
collected
under
422.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
it
was
argued
on
the
motion
for
rehearing
your
honor
and
it
is
in
the
appendix
as
i
recall
at
the
very
end,
page
--
starts
at
page
36,
36
a
and
runs
over
to
page
42.
the
particular
argument
is
--
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
it
was
not
raised
prior
to
the
motion
for
rehearing.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
no,
the
new
hampshire
court
simply
says
that
the
money
goes
to
the
aeronautics
fund
which
is
making
the
statement
appear
that
100%
goes
to
the
aeronautics
fund,
that
just
isn't
--
that
isn't
acted
under
the
terms
of
the
statute
itself
which
lays
out
that
50%
goes
to
the
aeronautics
fund
and
50%
to
the
municipality.
again
--
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
there
is
in
the
record
just
the
statement
about
landing
fees
and
rentals
and
that
type
of
state,
but
not
in
detail
your
honor.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
oh!
yes,
i
think
it
does.
i
think
it
does
clearly.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
i
do
not
--
i
can
not
say
that
the
record
specifically
shows
that
i
think
--
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
no,
the
state
aeronautical
fund
under
the
1959
statute,
which
i
will
come
to
in
a
minute,
it
is
an
older
statute,
did
earmark
the
fund
received
under
that
statute
for
paying
off
bonds
and
notes
incurred
at
the
various
airports.
the
1969
statute
which
is
a
one
we
are
talking
about
now
does
not
have
that
same
provision
and
the
state
aeronautical
commission
can
expand
its
funds
for
general
aviation
or
for
improving
navigational
facilities
throughout
the
states
that
type
of
expenditure.
it
does
not
have
to
spend
the
money
on
any
particular
airport,
or
the
airport
from
which
the
funds
were
received.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
no,
then
there
is
a
berlin
and
addition
to
that
berlin
and
laconia.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
the
court
in
new
hampshire,
the
supreme
court,
refused
to
follow
crandall
and
nevada
and
the
passenger
cases,
specifically
stating
that
its
reason
for
not
following
those
were
that
those
involved
a
tax
directly
on
the
passenger
and
not
on
the
carrier
as
the
court
said
was
the
case
here.
it
also
refused
to
follow
the
montana
case
and
distinguished
the
indiana
case
that
we
have
just
argued,
the
evansville
case,
again
on
the
ground
that
there
the
tax
was
on
the
passenger
and
here
it
is
on
the
carrier
and
it
distinguished
the
new
jersey
case
which
had
been
decided
by
the
trial
court
and
the
state
withdrew
its
appeal
on
the
ground
that
there
the
statute
allowed
the
monies
collected
to
go
into
the
general
funds
of
the
cities
which
didn't
own
the
airports.
the
court
noted
that
in
1959,
it
had
rendered
an
advisory
opinion
on
a
similar
statute,
but
one
applicable
only
to
carriers
engaged
in
intrastate
commerce.
it
had
upheld
that
statute
and
had
noted
in
its
opinion,
in
its
advisory
opinion
that
objection
by
anyone
to
the
effect
on
interstate
commerce
was
unlikely
in
view
of
the
aero
mayflower
transit
case,
332
us
and
terrell
against
johnson,
86
new
hampshire.
we
contend
here
that
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
erred
in
holding
that
the
right
to
travel
cases,
including
crandall
do
not
apply
because
the
tax
in
new
hampshire
is
on
the
carrier
rather
than
on
the
passengers.
we
contend
that,
that
is
an
error
of
law
in
determining
that
the
tax
in
new
hampshire
was
on
the
carrier,
not
the
passengers.
we
contend
that
it
also
erred
in
failing
to
follow
the
crandall
line
of
cases
because
of
its
view
that
those
cases
were
merely
based
on
the
theory
of
power
to
tax
as
a
power
to
destroy.
we
submit
that
it
erred
in
holding
that
the
act
of
enplanement,
which
it
found
was
the
incidence
of
taxation,
is
wholly
an
intrastate
event.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
i
--
yes
sir.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
i
would
submit
your
honor,
that
where
the
--
what
i
conceive
be
the
right
to
travel
is
involved,
that
it
is
in
fact
a
metaphysical.
that
here
a
state
in
imposing
a
tax,
but
in
this
case
on
the
carrier
measured
by
the
number
of
passengers
but
i
think
that
it
should
be
considered
as
one
directly
on
the
passenger
when
its
the
tax
of
this
kind,
where
it
can
where
doubt
--
it
do
that.
i
think
that
it
clearly
has
the
power,
that
it
is
exercising
the
power
to
control
and
to
some
extent
suppress
the
right
to
travel
or
which
is
a
right
that
i
believe
has
more
than
just
--
is
based
on
more
than
just
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
oh!
i
concede
that
it
doesn't
have
the
right
to
travel
on
state's
expense,
yes.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
indeed,
your
honor,
i
urge
that
they
can
and
i
think
that
the
cases
cited
in
all
of
the
briefs
that
have
been
filed
show
the
vast
number
of
ways
in
which
the
state
or
a
community
can
raise
money.
yesterday,
the
question
of
landing
fees
came
up,
clearly
the
state
of
an
airport
can
impose
landing
fees
that
will
raise
a
substantial
amount
of
money.
the
(inaudible)
can
certainly
be
increased
and
raise
money
and
both
proceeds
--
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
i
certainly
do,
i
certainly
do.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
--it
is
bound
to
be
ultimately
attached
onto
the
--
in
some
fashion
to
the
price
of
transportation,
but
it
is
not
attached
sort
of
dollar
or
penny
for
penny
on
the
head
of
the
person
traveling
from
for
example
laconia
to
boston.
the
laconia
airport
which
i
am
fairly
familiar
is
a
very
small
airport.
it
could
stand
i
am
sure
a
great
deal
of
improvement
and
could
probably
would
be
a
fairly
small
amount
of
traffic.
that
could
justify
a
very
high
enplanement
charge
without
that
charge
being
excessive.
it
would
certainly
burden
travel
between
laconia
and
boston
if
it
did
that.
now,
a
gross
receipts
and
a
properly
apportioned
gross
receipts
tax
or
properly
apportioned
income
tax,
some
other
type
of
personal
property
tax
on
airlines
that
would
be
borne
by
passengers
traveling
throughout
the
united
states,
instead
of
simply
borne
by
those
traveling,
seeking
to
leave
laconia
and
get
to
boston
would
be
a
very
different
thing,
and
it
would
also
be
under
the
regulatory
control
of
the
civil
aeronautics
board
which
has
the
obligation
and
the
power
to
allocate
routes
and
to
regulate
these,
so
they
can
carry
out
its
purpose
in
seeing
that
the
nation
is
served
by
commercial
carriers
rather
than
just
a
particular
route.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
view
a
landing
as
a
fee
for
the
use
of
a
airport
and
i
think
that
basically
that's
what
it
is
rather
than
--
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
it
is
certainly
one
of
the
acts
that
people
do
after
they
have
used
the
airport,
they
get
out
after
they
have
used
the
terminal,
they
are
using
the
runway.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
yes
sir,
they
are
using
it.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
enplanement
by
definition
is
the
act
of
boarding
the
airplane
with
the
intent
to
depart.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
for
the
purpose
of
departure,
not
with
the
intent
to
depart,
but
the
purpose
of
departure.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
i
think
you
are
engaged
in
enplanement
when
you
board
the
aircraft
you
honor
for
the
propose
of
departure.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
yes
you
are,
you
are.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
you
are,
indeed
you
are
and
you
are
using
it
when
you
go
there
for
any
purpose.
under
these
taxes,
if
you
go
to
the
airport,
have
your
ticket,
sit
and
wait,
the
plane
is
canceled
for
some
reason,
there
is
no
tax.
if
you
board
the
plane
and
it
takes
off,
there
is
a
tax.
i
do
not
know
what
happens
with
tax
under
those
conditions.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
i
didn't
mean
to
say,
your
honor,
that
the
cab
allocates
funds.
they
allocate
routes
and
have
the
obligation
of
determining
rates
that
will
resolved
in
a
serve
--
in
a
airline
service
throughout
the
country
rather
than
the
local
government
being
--
or
a
state
government
being
able
to
impose
a
tax
or
a
charge
that
will
influence
or
it
can
influence
the
fares
to
such
an
extent
that
it
restricts
the
right
to
travel
from
that
state.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
i
think
the
airline
suggests
some
type
of
uniform
charge.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
by
--
well,
by
a
uniform
charge
that
would
be
imposed,
that
would
flow
back
to
facilities
that
need
the
money
rather
than
publicly
rather
than
a
uniform
charge
by
facilities
themselves.
that
would
avoid
the
problem
of
the
differing
amounts
and
the
differing
incidence
of
taxation.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
your
honor,
i
say
that
higher
landing
fees
are
a
way
in
which
the
airports
can
raise
money
without
in
my
judgment
violating
the
constitution.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
i
do
not
think
i
have
a
constitutional
argument
your
honor,
no.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
they
certainly
do
not,
your
honor.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
when
you
say
i
am
suggesting
that
there
be
a
--
if
it
be
deemed
desirable
to
do
it
this
way,
that
the
federal
government
--
indeed
the
secretary
of
transportation,
secretary
wolfe
(ph)
at
one
point
suggested
to
the
house
ways
and
means
committee,
a
bill
under
which
congress
would
authorize
the
states
to
impose
a
reasonable
charge
on
enplaning
passengers
if
they
could
get
the
airline
serving
that
airport
to
agree
to
that
charge.
he
talked
in
terms
of
$1
charge,
then
it
would
be
a
uniform
charge.
now
i
think
that
the
question
of
obtaining
uniformity
here
is
extremely
important
in
this
--
in
any
way
of
raising
money
on
the
--
through
any
kind
of
enplaning
tax.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
under
my
proposal
it
would
be,
yes.
the
charge
would
be
the
same.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
that
--
it
may
vary
very
greatly
and
the
amount
of
the
money
that
would
then
flow
back
to
the
san
francisco
airport
may
--
would
vary,
would
definitely
vary
greatly
from
that
flows
to
laconia.
to
go
back
to
the
new
hampshire
court’s
refusal
to
follow
crandall
because
it
stated
that
here
the
tax
was
on
the
carrier,
not
passenger.
we
believe
that
the
court
--
the
court
also
found
in
new
hampshire
that
the
act,
there
was
a
service
charge
as
i
said.
i
think
a
fair
reading
of
the
court's
opinion
indicates
that
its
finding,
that
it
was
a
service
charge,
depends
greatly,
in
substantial
measure
on
its
finding
that
the
act
of
enplanement
is
a
wholly
intrastate
act,
which
we
contend
is
wrong
under
the
cases.
now
the
stipulation
in
new
hampshire
again
shows
that
a
majority
of
the
users
are
not
taxed
and
it
also
shows
that
the
use
by
the
minority
who
are
taxed
is
substantially
no
different
from
that
of
the
majority
who
are
not
taxed.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
because
--
excuse
me.
higher
landing
fees
at
all
airports
simply
go
into
the
cost
of
operating
an
airline.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
they
do
not
--
excuse
me
i
am
sorry.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
that
goes
into
the
general
cost
of
operating
of
the
airlines
--
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
--
and
the
fee
--
and
the
fare
from
laconia
to
boston
is
not
based
entirely
or
even
in
large
measure
on
the
landing
fee
at
the
laconia
airport.
those
costs
are
then
--
you
adjust
your
fares
to
recoup
those
costs.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
it's
going
to
cost
people
more
to
travel,
but
it's
not
going
to
cost
-–
it's
not
going
to
be
a
direct
burden
on
the
passenger
from
laconia
to
boston.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
by
the
--
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
i
am
sorry.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
i
am
not
--
well,
once
you
make
the
judgment
that
they
shouldn't
be
paying
it,
i
think
that
it
would
follow,
your
conclusion
would
follow.
i
think
that
any
of
the
costs,
or
right
now
the
costs
at
laconia
on
landing
fees
of
$50
for
fairchild
227
and
$75
for
dc-9.
now
those
costs
are
not
just
divided
by
the
number
of
passengers
carried
from
the
airport
in
new
hampshire.
if
that's
wrong,
it's
wrong,
but
it's
certainly
not
done
that
way.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
do
your
honor.
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
perhaps
another
lawyer
will
be
arguing
the
landing
--
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
--
but
i
am
not
prepared
to
--
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
that
the
tax
--
no,
well
it's
more
than
that
one
one
word
your
honor.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
the
fact
that
it's
a
tax
on
enplanement,
i
think
it
takes
it
out
of
the
use
tax
category
in
the
indiana
case.
the
fact
that
the
taxable
advantage,
the
act
of
enplanement,
i
submit
brings
it
under
crandall
against
nevada,
the
passenger
cases,
and
a
number
of
other
cases,
and
indeed
brings
into
play
the
--
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
the
landing
fee?
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
as
far
as
i
am
prepared
to
say
today,
as
i
view
the
landing
fee,
it's
alright,
yes.
as
i
say,
some
other
lawyer
maybe
here
arguing
the
constitutionality
of
the
landing
fee
with
you,
it's
fine,
but
i
am
prepared
to
say
that
landing
fee
is
alright
under
my
view
of
the
constitutionality.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
it's
not
a
direct
paid
tax
--
it's
not
a
direct
tax
on
the
passenger.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
the
enplaning
fee
is
a
direct
tax
on
the
passenger.
the
fact
--
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
well
--
i
am
coming
to
that
the
--
if
i
may
your
honor,
see
in
the
passenger
cases,
in
crandall,
in
henderson
against
mayor
of
new
york,
all
of
those
were
taxes
in
which
it
was
argued
that
the
tax
was
on
the
carrier.
there
is
no
--
in
the
crandall
case
the
tax,
in
fact,
was
on
the
passenger,
but
it
was
argued
that
it
was
a
tax
on
the
carrier.
in
the
passenger
cases,
it
was
a
tax
on
the
master
or
the
owner.
in
henderson
against
the
mayor
of
new
york,
it
was
a
tax
on
the
master
or
the
owner.
in
the
shay
wong
(ph)
case
it
was
the
tax
on
the
master.
in
people
versus
compagnie
générale
transatlantique,
it
was
a
tax
on
the
owner.
in
each
one
of
those
cases,
the
court
was
met
with
the
argument
that
here
is
a
tax
on
the
carrier,
it's
not
the
passenger.
it's
a
use
tax
or
it's
a
tax
on
the
privilege
of
doing
business.
in
each
one
of
those
cases
the
court
looked
through
that,
and
specifically
held
that
as
a
legal
matter,
as
a
constitutional
matter
a
tax
of
this
type
on
the
carrier
measured
by
flat
rate
per
head
on
the
passenger
is
to
be
viewed
for
constitutional
purposes
as
a
tax
directly
on
the
passenger.
now
the
supreme
court
of
new
hampshire
ignored
those
cases.
it
didn't
--
they
were
brief,
it
did
not
discuss
them
at
all
in
its
opinion.
in
the
passenger
cases,
chief
justice
taney
in
dissenting,
but
in
discussing
at
the
interstate,
an
intrastate
tax,
a
tax
on
citizens
moving
from
one
state
to
another
was
also
covered
in
those
statutes
and
finding
that
that
was
unconstitutional
specifically
dealt
with
whether
or
not
a
tax
of
this
type
was
one
to
be
viewed
is
on
the
carrier
or
the
passenger.
and
he
held
that
it
was
stated
that,
it
was
on
holding
that
it
was
to
be
viewed
as
a
tax
on
the
passenger.
in
henderson
against
new
york,
the
state
was
specifically
trying
to
avoid
the
holding
in
the
passenger
cases.
and
they
made
it
absolutely
clear
that
the
charge
was
not
on
the
passenger,
but
on
the
master
gave
them
an
alternative
to
post
a
bond
or
pay
$1.50
for
each
passenger.
new
york
argued
in
that
case
that
the
tax,
the
act
i
am
sorry,
the
act
to
be
passed
now
by
the
court
does
not
impose
a
tax
on
the
passenger.
the
act
--
the
state
also
argued
that
the
act
cannot
be
tortured
into
an
indirect
mode
of
imposing
a
tax
or
duty
upon
the
passenger
as
such.
the
court
noted
that
argument
and
specifically
stated,
in
whatever
language
a
statute
maybe
framed
its
purpose
must
be
determined
by
its
natural
reasonable
effect,
and
if
it
is
apparent
that
the
object
of
this
statute
is
judged
by
that
criterion,
is
to
compel
the
owners
of
vessels
to
pay
sum
of
money
for
each
passenger
brought
by
them
from
a
foreign
shore
and
landed
at
the
port
of
new
york,
it
is
as
much
a
tax
on
the
passengers,
if
collected
from
them,
or
a
tax
on
the
vessel
owner
for
the
exercise
of
the
right
of
landing
their
passengers
in
that
city,
as
was
the
statute
held
void
in
the
passenger
cases.
in
crandall
against
nevada,
the
same
argument
was
made,
that
it
was
a
tax
on
the
carrier.
in
fact
there
the
statute
i
think
was
fairly
clear
but
it
was
on
--
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
and
private
aviation
as
well
and
so
on?
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
well,
i
would
suspect
that
under
those
views,
the
tax
would
probably
be
excessive
that
if
in
fact
now.
once
you
impose
the
tax
generally
it's
going
to
be
a
much
smaller
amount.
in
indiana,
for
example,
you
had
85,000
take
offs
and
landings
by
civil
aviation
and
only
14
by
commercial
aviation.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
in
this
case
rested
its
decision
entirely
on
the
commerce
clause
and
declared
the
ordinance
invalid
under
the
commerce
clause.
it
filed
the
validity
there
and
stated
that
it
did
not
therefore
reach
the
other
constitutional
issues
in
the
case
that
had
been
decided
by
the
trial
court.
the
trial
court
had
decided
the
ordinance
invalid
under
the
constitutional
right
to
travel,
the
fourteenth
amendment,
privileges
and
immunities
clause
and
equal
protection
clause
and
it
also
found
it
invalid
under
the
indiana
constitution.
we
contend
unconstitutionality
under
all
of
these
and
particularly
under
the
constitutional
right
to
travel.
however
since
i
am
seeking
affirmance
of
the
indiana
supreme
court
decision,
i
intend
to
limit
or
to
rely
principally
or
discuss
principally
the
commerce
clause
decision
by
it.
the
crucial
issue,
i
submit
under
the
commerce
clause
is
whether
or
not,
this
is
a
use
tax.
the
case
has
been
argued
and
i
think
briefed
by
the
other
side
on
the
assumption
that
it
is
a
use
tax.
the
cases
it
cites,
the
highway
use
cases
principally
are
use
tax
cases.
it
is
my
submission
to
this
court
that
the
tax
is
not
a
use
tax
case.
it
is
not
a
use
charge.
it
is
not
a
service
charge.
rather
it
is
a
charge
or
a
tax
on
the
passenger
for
the
act
of
enplanement.
that
is,
it
is
a
charge
on
the
passenger
for
the
act
of
boarding
the
aircraft
for
the
purpose
of
departure
88%
of
the
people
who
are
enplaning
at
this
airport
or
enplaning
for
an
out
of
state
place.
the
question
and
issue
of
whether
or
not
this
is
a
use
tax
has
been
before
the
court’s
on
four
states
and
it
has
been
present
in
these
cases
since
these
ordinances
gained
popularity
some
four
years
ago.
it
has
been
and
was
discussed
directly
before
the
trial
court
and
the
indiana
supreme
court.
in
this
case,
they
decided
that
it
was
not
a
use
tax.
it
was
not
a
charge
for
use
and
that
it
was
dependent
solely
on
the
act
of
enplanement.
it
was
before
the
montana
supreme
court
in
a
very
similar
case
except
that
in
the
montana
case,
the
charge
was
nominally
levied
on
the
air
carrier
rather
than
on
the
passenger.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
no,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
it
depends
on
the
incidence
of
the
tax.
the
taxable
event
set
forth
in
the
ordinance
or
the
statute.
and
the
taxable
event
set
forth
here
is
not
use
of
the
airport
facilities
by
the
passenger.
it’s
the
act
of
enplanement,
that
is
boarding
the
aircraft
for
the
purpose
of
departure
under
the
ordinance
itself.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
but
when
you
say
similar
tax,
i
have
some
problems,
but
where
certainly,
one
can
conceive
of
the
airport
board
putting
up
the
turnstile
as
you
enter
the
airport
terminal
that
all
users
have
to
put
in
a
dime
or
25
cents
or
whatever
and
walk
through
the
turnstile
to
use
the
airport
terminal.
i
think
i
would
have
a
much
different
argument
and
a
much
harder
argument
than
i
have
here.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
i
would
think
that
that
would
be
quite
clearly
unconstitutional
your
honor
under
the
large
number
of
cases
that
say
that
state
cannot
tax
the
act
of
transportation
which
is
really
the
basis
for
the
cases
that
we
rely
on
here
under
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
no,
i
would
not
differentiate
that
from
the
act
of
deplaning,
your
honor.
i
am
differentiating
it
from
the
act
of
the
passenger
using
the
airport
terminal
on
which
this
tax
is
not
levied.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
i
would
want
to
see
the
ordinance.
i
do
not
think
that
it
would
be
for
the
use
of
the
airport
more
clearly.
i
think
that
it
would
then
for
the
act
of
landing
in
an
aircraft.
it
will
depend
on
the
statute
of
the
ordinance,
obviously.
but
i
think
it
would
be
for
the
act
of
landing
in
an
aircraft
there.
i
think
this
question
raised
a
point
that
should
be
emphasized
here.
in
arguing
the
unconstitutionality
of
this
ordinance
or
of
a
statute
similar
to
this,
i
am
not
contending
and
i
do
not
want
to
be
misunderstood
that
there
is
no
way
that
the
airport
board
can
increase
its
income
or
can
make
as
the
other
side
says
can
make
interstate
commerce
pay
its
fair
share.
the
case
is
a
liegemen
under
which
states
and
localities
have
made
interstate
commerce
pay
its
fair
share.
they
are
properly
apportioned
gross
receipts
taxes,
properly
apportioned
net
income
taxes,
in
this
case,
we
have
landing
fees,
in
this
case,
we
have
rentals
and
there
are
privilege
taxes.
there
are
any
number
of
ways
that
the
state
can
make
interstate
commerce
pay
its
fair
share.
so,
i
am
contending
that
these
ordinances,
with
the
incidence
on
the
tax
of
enplanement
or
invalid
as
a
tax
on
direct
tax
on
interstate
commerce
and
that
the
dangers
of
such
a
tax
in
multiple
taxation
emphasize
the
burden
that
will
be
placed
on
interstate
commerce.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
your
honor,
you
are
saying
that
the
state
can
–-
with
all
respect,
it
seems
to
me
you
are
saying
that
the
amount
of
money
that
the
state
can
raise
would
be
the
same
under
the
two
circumstances.
but
it
seems
to
me
the
first
question
and
it
seems
to
me
spector
teaches
this
and
a
number
of
other
freeman
against
hewit
and
mcleod
against
dilworth
case,
that
the
first
thing
that
one
has
to
consider
is
not
whether
the
state
may
validly
raise
money
in
some
fashion
on
interstate
commerce
but
what
the
constitutional
channel
through
which
it
attempts
to
raise
it
is
and
whether
that
constitutional
channel
is,
in
fact,
constitutional
or
unconstitutional.
and
what
i
might
--
statement
about
the
turnstiles
was
not
that
enplaning
passengers
would
have
to
drop
the
dime
or
quarter
in
the
turnstile.
it
was
that
all
users
would
have
to
do
it
and
that
the
act
of
taxation.
the
taxable
event
was
not
enplaning
in
interstate
commerce
but
on
the
use
of
the
airport.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
oh
yes!
yes,
your
honor.
they
would
have
to
go
through
the
turnstile.
and
they
would
have
to
pay
for
the
use
of
the
airport
terminal.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
in
other
words,
your
honor,
if
the
ordinance
read
that
landing
fees
will
be
increased
by
one
dollar
per
enplaning
passenger,
there
i
think
that
i
come
back
that
the
taxable
event
is
the
active
enplanement.
and
under
the
--
basically
from
crandall
against
nevada
to
the
extent
that
that
may
be
viewed
as
a
commerce
clause
case
right
after
the
–-
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
so
long
as
the
landing
fee
depends
on
the
weight
of
the
plane,
i
have
no
problem
with
it.
that
is
the
type
of
use
tax
that
has
been
upheld
where
the
use
of
the
highways,
the
truck
depends
on
the
weight,
or
the
amount
paid
by
the
trucker
depends
on
the
weight
of
the
truck
and
so
on.
but
anytime
the
tax
is
a
tax
that
is
on
the
passenger,
as
this
one
is
measured
on
the
carrier
measured
by
a
flat
amount
per
head
by
the
passenger.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
your
honor,
that
gets
into
the
--
obviously,
the
airlines
passed
on
charges
but
where
the
charge
is
a
dollar
or
two
dollars
a
head
or
whatever
it
may
be
from
a
particular
airport,
that
is
passed
on
direct
from
that
airport.
and
it
removes
the
ability
of
the
carrier
and
from
the
cab,
the
idea
of
apportioning
its
rates
in
such
a
way
as
to
serve
aviation
generally.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
i
suppose
if
one
could
argue
that
that
would
be
excessive
and
i
suppose
that
one
could
argue
that
it
was
in
fact
a
tax
on
enplanement
and
therefore
unconstitutional.
as
i
said
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
on
the
turnstile
question,
i
do
not
say
that
that
is
clearly
constitutional.
all
i
say
on
that
is
that
i
have
a
very
different
argument
and
what
i
would
conceive
to
be
a
much
more
difficult
argument
than
i
have
in
this
case.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
it
really
would
if
you
have
the
charge
–-
if
you
have
a
toll
charge
on
an
access
rather
than
one
has
to
use
to
get
into
the
airport.
clearly,
that
is
a
much
harder
case
and
a
much
different
case.
now,
on
the
question
of
the
operating
need,
mr.
trockman
yesterday
stated
that
the
airport
board
had
an
operating
deficit
and
i
do
not
contest
that.
i
think
it
might
be
well
to
put
it
in
some
perspective.
the
total
operating
income
in
1967
of
the
board
was
some
$268,900.00.
that
was
raised
about
equally
by
and
this
is
exclusive
of
property
taxes
in
the
area.
that’s
about
equally
from
aviation
sources
and
non-aviation
sources
(inaudible)
that
was
the
total
operating.
the
total
operating
disbursements
exclusive
of
bond
retirement
of
a
$166,000.00
leaving
an
operating
profit
exclusive
of
bond
retirement
of
approximately
$100,000.00.
the
bond
retirement
cost
was
$182,000.00.
incidentally,
this
is
shown,
these
figures
are
taken
from
paragraph
25
in
appendix
page
59
and
from
exhibit
5
to
the
stipulation
of
facts
which
was
not
printed.
the
only
figure
taken
from
exhibit
5
is
the
operating
disbursements
and
the
breakdown
of
the
income
between
aviation
and
non-aviation
sources.
as
i
said,
the
bond
retirement
costs
were
$182,000.00.
the
operating
profit
exclusive
of
the
bond
retirement
was
about
$100,000.00.
you
had
a
deficit
of
something
less
than
a
$100,000.00
including
the
bond
retirement
in
the
operating
expenses.
i
do
not
have
the
figure
in
the
record
but
the
1970
annual
report
of
the
airport
board
shows
that
about
20.56%
of
the
general
fund
revenues
come
from
property
taxes.
now,
that
does
not
include
the
amount
that
goes
of
property
taxes
that
goes
into
the
building
fund
for
the
airport.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
nothing
has
been
raised
from
the
dollar
a
head
tax,
sir.
the
lower
court
enjoined,
the
trial
court
enjoined
that
in
the
collection
and
the
supreme
court
of
course
of
indiana
affirmed
the
trial
court’s
decision.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
i
have
none.
the
court
raised
and
asked
questions
about
yesterday.
my
brother
made
a
response
saying
that
there
was
an
operating
deficit.
i
said
that
--
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
it
is
still
a
deficit
after
bond
retirement.
yes,
your
honor,
of
something
less
than
a
$100,000.00.
coming
back
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
is
a
use
tax
and
therefore
a
sense
governed
or
controlled
by
the
highway
use
tax
cases.
the
indiana
supreme
court
responded
quite
directly
to
the
airport
board’s
argument
that
this
charge
is
a
service
charge
for
the
use
of
facilities
and
stated
that
there
is
no
question
that
the
incidence
of
the
tax
imposed
by
ordinance
33
falls
on
interstate
commerce.
and
it
also
held
that
the
tax
is
on
the
active
enplanement.
focused
quite
squarely
on
the
issue
of
whether
the
act
of
enplanement
was
reasonably
related
to
the
use
of
airport
facilities
and
held
that
and
i
quote
that,
“it
is
clear
that
the
tax
imposed
by
ordinance
33
is
not
reasonably
related
to
the
use
of
the
facilities
which
benefit
from
the
tax.”
trial
court
made
similar
findings
stating
that
not
withstanding
the
name
given
the
charge
nor
the
stated
justification
for
the
charge,
its
operating
incidence
is
solely
on
the
act
of
enplanement.
the
trial
court
also
made
findings
that
the
use
of
the
airport
by
the
minority
who
were
taxed
was
no
different
in
quality
or
amount
than
the
use
by
the
majority
who
were
not
taxed.
that
it
does
depend
on
the
act
of
enplanement
and
not
use,
i
think
it
is
clear
from
the
reading
of
the
ordinance
itself.
it
imposes
what
is
called
in
the
ordinance
a
use
and
service
charge
of
$1.00
per
each
passenger
enplaning
any
commercial
aircraft
operated
from
the
dress
memorial
airport.
it
imposes
on
the
airline
the
obligation
to
collect
that
tax
and
remit
it
to
the
state
based
on
the
number
of
enplaning
passengers
times
the
$1.00
charge.
the
tax
as
the
trial
court
and
the
supreme
court
noted
is
not
imposed
on
all
users
only
on
a
minority.
while
those
findings
on
the
discriminatory
nature
of
the
charge
form
the
basis
of
the
court’s
holding
in
part
of
the
basis
of
the
court’s
holding
under
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
also
its
holding
of
invalidity
under
the
nevada
constitution.
the
arbitrary
nature
of
the
charge
or
selection
of
passengers
–-
selection
of
users
who
will
be
charged
also
formed
its
basis
or
partly
formed
its
basis
for
the
finding
that
it
was
not
a
use
charge.
i
submit
that
the
fact
that
the
funds
collected
under
this
tax
go
into
the
airport
board
funds
for
the
use
on
the
airport
does
not
make
this
a
use
tax.
it
is
clearly
a
relevant
consideration
for
the
court
to
consider
in
determining
whether
or
not
it
is
a
use
tax
but
it
is
not
decisive.
and
i
think
that
mccarroll
against
dixie
greyhound
309
u.s.
points
that
out.
the
court
there
stated
that
it
is
not
enough
that
the
tax
when
collected
is
expended
upon
the
state’s
highways.
it
must
appear
on
the
face
of
the
statute
of
the
demonstrable
where
the
taxes
laid
is
measured
by
or
has
some
fair
relationship
to
the
use
of
the
highways
to
which
the
charge
is
made.
going
back
to
a
minute
on
this
question
of
what
the
funds
are
to
be
used
for,
that
argument
indeed
was
made
in
crandall
against
nevada.
there
at
page
38,
“the
state
argued
that
the
state
makes
roads,
keeps
them
in
repair,
and
must
in
some
way
be
paid
in
order
to
be
able
to
do
all
of
this.”
and
what
difference
does
it
make,
whether
it
is
to
be
paid
by
a
tax
of
$1.00
on
each
passenger
or
by
the
same
sum
collected
at
a
toll
gate,
or
by
gross
sum
for
a
license?
the
court
in
crandall
indicated
that
it
made
a
good
bit
of
difference
as
to
whether
it
was
constitutional
to
tax
the
passenger
at
$1.00
a
head
for
leaving
the
state
even
though
he
had
obviously
used
the
roads,
and
the
state
had
to
build
and
keep
them
repaired.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
no,
i
don’t
believe
that’s
fact
your
honor.
it
was
imposed
on
passengers
in
departing
or
leaving
the
state,
as
i
recall,
by
stage
coach
railroad
and
it
had
another
list
of
things.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
because
the
state
did
not
construct
the
railroad.
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that
is
quite
right.
but
they
clearly
had
constructed
the
roads
over
which
the
stage
coach
passengers
ran.
in
crandall,
it
is
my
recollection,
your
honor,
that
crandall
was
a
stage
coach
operator
or
owner
who
was
contesting
the
statute.
incidentally,
the
use
of
the
proceeds
was
argued
in
the
henderson
against
the
mayor
of
new
york
case
where
two-thirds
of
the
funds
went
to
the
commissioner
of
immigration
for
inspection
and
to
build
wards
and
warehouses.
in
the
passenger
case
part
of
the
funds
went
to
a
marine
hospital
in
people
against
compagnie
generale
transatlantique,
the
sums
went
to
the
commission
of
immigration
for
inspection
expenses
and
the
remainder
was
remitted
to
the
united
states
treasury.
the
states
at
that
time
were
seeking
many
ways
to
validate
this
type
of
tax.
and
in
each
one,
the
argument
would
be
made
that
the
funds
were
being
used
to
recompense
the
state
for
expenses
made
by
it
in
tearing
out
its
proper
functions.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
well,
i
would
deal
with
that
in
two
ways,
your
honor.
first,
it’s
not
a
commerce
clause
but
in
fact
i
don’t
think
it
is
the
most
important
ground.
it
is
the
question
under
article
1,
section
10
of
the
article.
secondly,
i
deal
with
it
by
saying
that
there
the
court
quite
properly
found
that
it
was
a
use
tax
and
was
not
a
tax
on
a
passenger
for
engaging
in
interstate
commerce.
and
i
think
that
the
sum
of
these
--
that
these
passengers
are
engaging
in
interstate
commerce.
when
they
board
the
plane
for
the
purpose
of
departure,
i
think
it’s
fairly
obvious
under
the
michigan-wisconsin
pipe
line
case
where
the
gathering
of
gas
was
considered
a
tax
directly
on
interstate
commerce.
i
think
the
same
thing
is
here.
the
same
thing
is
present
here.
i
think
in
the
joseph
against
carter
&
weeks
which
was
a
loading
of
freight
case
and
baltimore
&
ohio
against
birch
which
was
the
same
type
of
case.
the
richfield
oil
case
where
the
court
said
the
commerce
begins
no
later
than
delivery
of
oil
into
the
vessel.
all
of
those,
i
think
indicate
very
strongly
that
the
passenger
boarding
the
plane
for
the
purpose
of
departure
which
is
what
enplanement
means,
that
the
passenger
is
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
and
the
tax
that’s
being
imposed
on
him
is
a
tax
imposed
on
him
for
the
privilege
of
engaging
in
that
act.
and
the
cases
that
talk
about
a
tax
on
a
passenger
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
or
on
a
passenger,
or
on
freight
that’s
being
loaded
or
has
been
loaded
for
interstate
commerce
and
striking
down
those
statutes
are
extremely
numerous.
basically,
you
can
probably
start
under
the
commerce
clause.
i
think
that
basically
you
can
start
to
submit
some
of
the
language
in
the
passenger
cases.
some
of
the
language
by
two
justices
in
the
crandall
case
plus
the
perry
case
which
just
has
a
black
has
a
statement
saying
that
you
can’t
pass
passengers
and
the
people
and
persons
engaged
in
interstate
commerce.
i
think
the
justice
or
chief
justice
taney’s
dissenting
opinion
in
the
passenger
cases
where
he
was
talking
about
not
aliens
but
persons
who
were
traveling
by
ship
from
one
state
to
another
and
who
were
taxed
at
the
rate
of
25
cents
a
head
for
departing
the
vessel
in
the
state
of
new
york.
his
comment
about
those
passengers
is
very
strong
in
saying
that
the
state
cannot
tax
those.
and
that
dissent
was
later,
i
believe,
quoted
in
crandall
and
has
been
re-quoted
in
cases
as
recently
as
gaston,
i
think,
in
the
shapiro
case,
shapiro
against
thompson
as
well.
in
the
minnesota
rate
cases,
the
court
said,
the
states
cannot
tax
interstate
commerce
either
by
a
laying
a
tax
upon
the
business
which
constitutes
such
commerce
with
the
privilege
of
engaging
in
it
or
upon
persons
of
property
in
transit
in
interstate
commerce.
i
would
also
submit
that
the
fact
that
here
the
incident
is
the
act
of
enplanement
rather
than
use
by
the
passenger,
lends
itself
to
considerable
different
multiple
local
taxation
involving
different
incidents
of
travel
and
also
differing
amounts.
as
to
the
amount
of
the
tax,
the
evansville
airport
board
has
stated
here
on
that
brief
in
an
argument
that
even
this
$1.00
is
not
enough
to
cover
the
cost
of
their
plan
of
improvements.
i
do
not
dispute
that
at
all.
indeed,
as
the
taxes
grow,
as
this
$1.00
becomes
more
the
ingenuity
of
an
airport
board
to
plan
other
improvements
can
make
a
charge
of
almost
any
amount
not
excessive.
so
i
think
that
it
is
quite
obvious
to
anticipate
that
there
will
be
taxes
if
this
ordinance
is
allowed
to
stand,
there
will
be
taxes
by
most
local
airports
in
this
country.
the
taxes,
i
think
will
vary
in
amount
and
i
think
that
they
will
vary
as
to
the
incident
of
taxation.
i
think
some
will
be
for
deplaning
passengers,
some
will
be
for
stopover
passengers,
and
some
would
be
for
in-transit
passengers.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
that
is
its
fundamental
function,
your
honor.
i
think
some
have
gotten
away
from
that
a
little
bit
with
fancy
restaurants
and
things
of
that
nature.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
i
am
not
sure
if
they
could,
your
honor.
i
must
confess
that
i
probably
can
not
answer
--
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
no,
not
just
because
there
might
be
interstate
passengers.
i
think
that
it
would
depend
on
a
great
deal
on
the
incidence
of
taxation.
if
it
were
done
by
a
toll,
say
to
the
access
road,
into
the
airport
and
for
the
use
of
that
road
that
may
have
--
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
in
air
freight
and
so
on
does
not
bear
any
of
the
obligation.
it
us
just
passengers.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
i
would
have
some
problem
with
that
by
excluding
freight,
i
am
sure.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
no.
well,
yes
because
it
discriminates
against
the
passengers
as
opposed
to
making
interstate
commerce
pay
for
the
freight
that
it
is
carrying
as
well.
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
i
am
sorry?
mr.
john
k.
mallory,
jr.
but
it
does
not
pay
any
tax
to
construct
the
airport.
