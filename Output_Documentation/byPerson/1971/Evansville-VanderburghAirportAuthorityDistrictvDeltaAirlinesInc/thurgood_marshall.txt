justice
thurgood
marshall
but
didn't
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
just
said
it
wasn't
using
tax,
because
the
only
people
they
got
taxed
were
only
that
flew
the
airplanes
not
those
who
used
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
some
of
the
trips
on
the
eastern
coast
where
you
take
off
and
come
back
to
the
same
airport,
what
would
happen
then?[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
mallory,
suppose
you
combine
the
evansville
one
with
this
one
and
this
one
in
new
hampshire
every
dollar
that
was
collected
went
into
the
airport,
do
we
have
any
problem
with
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
still
can't
see
that
difference
between
the
landing
fee
and
this?
justice
thurgood
marshall
except
that
[voice
overlap]
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
understand
it's,
your
argument
is
the
word
enplaning,
that
one
word?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
else?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
on
the
landing
--
the
landing
fee,
you
land
for
what
purposes?
two
purposes,
to
let
somebody
off,
and
let
somebody
“enplane”
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
but
that's
alright?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
landing
fees
are
paid
for
the
use
of
the
facilities
at
the
airport?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
what
is
the
enplaning
fee?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
thought
here
they
collected
it
from
northeast?
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
the
statute
or
the
ordinance
said
that
everybody
that
uses
our
runways
shall
pay
$1
fees,
everybody
including
the
pilot,
co-pilot,
baggage
handlers,
everybody?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
dunn,
you
are
trying
to
convince
me
that
it's
easier
for
me
to
pay
the
dollar
than
northeast
airlines?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
is
no
real
problem,
you
are
afraid
if
you
raise
then
they’ll
all
overfly
your
airport,
do
you
agree?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
none
of
your
business
whether
it
is
passed
on
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
could
not
stop
them
from
there
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
could
not
force
them
to
pass
it
on?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
mallory,
what
would
happen
if
they
raised
the
regular
fees
for
landing
and
taking
off
which
they
now
have
by
$1.00
each
passenger?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
the
fact
that
one
of
the
measures
of
the
landing
fees
is
the
weight
of
the
plane?
so
i
mean,
the
more
passengers
has
more
weight,
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
then
mr.
john
would
you
say,
it
made
no
difference
if
you
raised
a
dollar
a
head
that
you
would
charge
it
to
the
passenger
anyhow,
so
they
just
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
my
final
question
is
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
airport
except
the
airline
booths
and
the
charge
facilities.
there’s
nothing
else.
and
you
have
a
$1.00
turnstile
outside,
what
would
your
position
be?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
it
be
more
difficult
if
you
had
it
out
on
a
parking
lot?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
didn't
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
just
said
it
wasn't
using
