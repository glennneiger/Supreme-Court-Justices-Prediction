what
are
the
other
sources
of
revenue?
are
there
any
other
source
of
tax
revenue
for
the
airport?
justice
byron
r.
white
part
of
that
is
allocated
to
the
airport?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
all
of
the
residents
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
as
a
practical
matter
how
will
airlines
pay
their
way
of
--
it
actually
be
using
the
airport?
as
airlines
they
pay
rent
for
their
--
justice
byron
r.
white
now
i
suppose
both
charges
passengers
end
up
paying?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
as
a
practical
matter
keeps
the
airport
authority
from
simply
raising
the
landing
fee
so
that
it
would
be
spread
over
everybody
who
is
using
that
particular
airline
and
that
particular
airport?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
did
you
do
it
that
way
rather
than
just
raising
the
landing
fee?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
don't
--
they
tax
the
deplaning
passengers?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
he
has
either
already
paid
it
when
he
left
or
he
is
going
to
pay
it
when
he
does
leave?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don’t
tax
anybody
who
comes
out
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
tax
them
--
you
charge
them
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
they
pay
you
rent.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
is
this
the
lot
of
(inaudible)
building
that
isn't
(inaudible),
the
cost
has
to
be
borne
by
the
authority
itself,
i
guess?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
privater
aircraft
that
use
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
just
pay
landing
fee.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
are
wrap
up
in
the
equivalent
of
any
landing
fees
or
enplaning
fees
in
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
this
dollar
a
head
just
went
into
the
general
revenue
of
the
county
or
of
the
state,
and
wasn't
allocated
for
the
use
of
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
you
might
be
stuck
with
crandall
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
a
revenue
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
was
just
a
wholly
a
revenue
measure?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
it's
been
charged
more
than
it
is
necessary
to
pay
its
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
let's
--
i
suppose
arguably
you
get
the
same
answer
even
if
this
tax
went
into
the
general
revenues
of
the
county
or
the
state
and
the
county
or
the
state
was
the
one
that
had
to
make
up
the
deficit
of
the
airport?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
the
state
could
show
that
every
year
it
appropriated
more
than
the
amount
of
the
tax
to
the
airport
--
justice
byron
r.
white
does
the
record
indicate
how
the
facilities
are
--
justice
byron
r.
white
does
the
municipality
contribute
any
funds
to
the
airports
authority?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
the
record
show
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
the
state
aeronautical
fund
finance
anything
for
airport?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
you
explain
what
are
the
acts
that
people
do
when
they
are
using
the
airport?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
are
using
it
when
they
enter?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
enplanement,
it's
getting
on
the
airplane?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
once
your
client
is
called
that
you
go
to
the
(inaudible)
engaged
in
enplanement?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
are
using
the
airport
and
that
terminal?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
are
using
the
airport
when
they
land
?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
they
might
be
satisfied
with
higher
landing
fees?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
if
they
just
raised
the
landing
fees
charged
to
the
airlines,
you
would
say,
they
may
not
like
it,
but
you
wouldn't
have
a
constitutional
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
think
you
would
have
the
--
if
your
fundamental
objection
here
or
part
of
it
is
that
this
kind
of
a
tax
loads
on
to
passengers
and
hence
on
new
air
travel
generally,
the
cost
of
expanding
an
airport
rather
than
spreading
the
cost
on
to
the
other
users
likewise,
i
don't
know
how
you
could
--
why
you
wouldn't
have
the
same
objection
to
higher
landing
fees?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand
but
this
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
airport,
if
the
airport
authorities
determined,
well
we
have
to
have
so
much
money
to
finance
an
expansion.
we're
going
to
increase
landing
fees
so
we
can
pay
for
them,
so
we
can
pay
off
the
bonds
we're
going
to
issue.
and
they
don't,
and
they
are
stuck
with
their
long-term
leases
on
all
the
airport
facilities
in
the
airport,
and
so
they
have
to
load
it
on
to
air
travel
and
they
decide
they
will
do
it
by
landing
fees.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that
but
if
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
sooner
or
later
it's
going
to
cost
people
more
to
travel?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
how
do
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
even
compounds
the
error?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
compounds
the
error,
doesn't
it?
this
means
that
you're
loading
onto
a
lot
people
who
shouldn't
be
paying
it,
the
cost
of
the
laconia
facility.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
that
say
that
you
are
supported
by
the
record
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
both
the
municipality
and
the
state
aeronautics
board
contribute
to
this
airport
or
to
each
airport
more
than
they
are
getting
out
of
this
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we're
just
in
no
position
on
this
record
to
put
that
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
it
would
be
inequitable.
well,
why
would
it
be
an
inequitable
way
of
raising
this
money?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
would
just
obviate
necessity
of
getting
a
rate
increase?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
--
rather
than
increasing
their
expenses
and
making
less
profit
under
the
existing
rates,
this
would
be
an
alternative
way
of
raising
the
money
and
charging
the
passengers?
justice
byron
r.
white
without
affecting
either
rates
of
profit?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh
yes,
but
didn't
your
law
ought
to
say
that
the
airline
may
pass
it
on
to
the
customer?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
it
doesn't
increase
the
burden
on
the
airline?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
pass
it
onto
the
customer?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
fee
is
being
passed
on
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
they
do
pass
it
on,
there
is
a
difference
between
the
landing
fee
and
this
kind
of
a
tax.
it
is
too
much
of
burden
on
the
airline?
justice
byron
r.
white
quite
a
bit?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
can
get
a
rate
increase
out
of
the
cab?
justice
byron
r.
white
has
there
been
any
suggestion
by
any
of
the
airlines
that
this
kind
of
tax
is
forbidden
as
inconsistent
with
the
regulating
authorities
of
cab?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
that
an
airline
pass
on
the
landing
fee?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
statutory
or
how
about
the
--
that's
normally
been
considered
an
expense,
that
it
is
taken
into
consideration
of
setting
a
fare,
hasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn't
you
be
surprised
if
that
was
permissible
for
the
carrier
to
have
an
authorized
rate
and
then
suddenly
take
some
of
these
expenses
on
which
the
rate
is
based
instead
of
charging
it
directly
to
the
passengers?
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn't
you
think
that
would
be
very
odd?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
how
about
a
take
off
fee?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
anytime
you
charge
an
air
carrier
something
for
the
use
of
an
airport,
it
seems
to
me
like
it
would
be
charging
the
same
sort
of
thing
as
a
landing
fee.
it
is
an
expense
for
the
air
carrier.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
business
does
the
airline
company
got
passing
it
onto
the
passenger?
it
is
an
expense
that
is
supposed
to
be
reflected
in
their
fare?
justice
byron
r.
white
some
of
the
airlines
are
not
doing
it,
are
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
would
think
they
will
probably
go
to
the
--
whatever
it
is
they
are
absorbing,
they
will
say
it
is
part
of
their
expense
for
the
next
go
around
for
the
raise?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
but
again
i
would
say
--
and
i
just
wonder
if
--
i
just
wonder
if
there
just
hasn't
been
any
question
that
the
airline
at
this
kind
of
a
tax
which
requires
the
airline
to
charge
a
customer
more
than
its
public
fares,
is
it
consistent
with
this
federal
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can
increase
your
landing
fee
without
interfering
with
anything
that
congress
is
doing,
and
here
you
are
charging
an
airline
more
for
using
the
airport?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
the
airline
is
free
to
do
what
it
wants
to
with
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
may
not
be
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
this
respect,
you
are
different
from
the
indiana
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
a
just
a
question?
are
the
airlines
who
are
represented
here
all
passing
the
tax
on
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
are
the
other
sources
of
revenue?
are
there
any
other
source
of
tax
revenue
for
the
airport?
justice
byron
r.
white
part
of
that
is
allocated
to
the
airport?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
all
of
the
residents
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
as
a
practical
matter
how
will
airlines
pay
their
way
of
--
it
actually
be
using
the
airport?
as
airlines
they
pay
rent
for
their
--
justice
byron
r.
white
now
i
suppose
both
charges
passengers
end
up
paying?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
as
a
practical
matter
keeps
the
airport
authority
from

raising
the
landing
fee
so
that
it
would
be
spread
over
everybody
who
is
using
that
particular
airline
and
that
particular
airport?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
did
you
do
it
that
way
rather
than
just
raising
the
landing
fee?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
don't
--
they
tax
the
deplaning
passengers?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
he
has
either
already
paid
it
when
he
left
or
he
is
going
to
pay
it
when
he
does
leave?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don’t
tax
anybody
who
comes
out
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
tax
them
--
you
charge
them
the
--
justice
byron

white
they
pay
you
rent.
justice
byron

white
but
is
this
the

inequitable
way
of
raising
this
money?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
would
just
obviate
necessity
of
getting
a
rate
increase?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
--
rather
than
increasing
their
expenses
and
making
less
profit
under
the
existing
rates,
this
would
be
an
alternative
way
of
raising
the
money
and
charging
the
passengers?
justice
byron
r.
white
without
affecting
either
rates
of
profit?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh
yes,
but
didn't
your
law
ought
to
say
that
the
airline
may
pass
it
on
to
the
customer?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
it
doesn't
increase
the
burden
on
the
airline?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
pass
it
onto
the
customer?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
fee
is
being
passed
on
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
they
do
pass
it
on,
there
is
a
difference
between
the
landing
fee
and
this
kind
of
a
tax.
it
is
too
much
of
burden
on
the
airline?
justice
byron
r.
white
quite
a
bit?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
can
get
a
rate
increase
out
of
the
cab?
justice
byron
r.
white
has
there
been
any
suggestion
by
any
of
the
airlines
that
this
kind
of
tax
is
forbidden
as
inconsistent
with
the
regulating
authorities
of
cab?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
that
an
airline
pass
on
the
landing
fee?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
statutory
or
how
about
the
--
that's
normally
been
considered
an
expense,
that
it
is
taken
into
consideration
of
setting
a
fare,
hasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn't
you
be
surprised
if
that
was
permissible
for
the
carrier
to
have
an
authorized
rate
and
then
suddenly
take
some
of
these
expenses
on
which
the
rate
is
based
instead
of
charging
it
directly
to
the
passengers?
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn't
you
think
that
would
be
very
odd?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
how
about
a
take
off
fee?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
anytime
you
charge
an
air
carrier
something
for
the
use
of
an
airport,
it
seems
to
me
like
it
would
be
charging
the
same
sort
of
thing
as
a
landing
fee.
it
is
an
expense
for
the
air
carrier.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
business
does
the
airline
company
got
passing
it
onto
the
passenger?
it
is
an
expense
that
is
supposed
to
be
reflected
in
their
fare?
justice
byron
r.
white
some
of
the
airlines
are
not
doing
it,
are
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
would
think
they
will
probably
go
to
the
--
whatever
it
is
they
are
absorbing,
they
will
say
it
is
part
of
their
expense
for
the
next
go
around
for
the
raise?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
but
again
i
would
say
--
and
i
just
wonder
if
--
i
just
wonder
if
there
just
hasn't
been
any
question
that
the
airline
at
this
kind
of
a
tax
which
requires
the
airline
to
charge
a
customer
more
than
its
public
fares,
is
it
consistent
with
this
federal
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can
increase
your
landing
fee
without
interfering
with
anything
that
congress
is
doing,
and
here
you
are
charging
an
airline
more
for
using
the
airport?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
the
airline
is
free
to
do
what
it
wants
to
with
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
may
not
be
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
this
respect,
you
are
different
from
the
indiana
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
a
just
a
question?
are
the
airlines
who
are
represented
here
all
passing
the
tax
on
or
not?
