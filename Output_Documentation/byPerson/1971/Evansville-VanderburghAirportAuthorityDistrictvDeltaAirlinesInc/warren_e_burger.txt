mr.

just
so
that
you

mr.

plan
your

we

probably
complete
your

and
perhaps
if
it's
feasible,
open
some
phase
of
your

argument.
chief

is
there
anything
to

that

out?

mr.

you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief

i
thought
you
have
virtually
conceded
that
there
were
probably
a
good
many
ways
in
which
the
state
or
the
local
authority
can
do
exactly
what
they're
doing
here
in
the
same
amount
without
a
constitutional
problem?
chief

warren
e.

do
you
think
these
other
ways
of
accomplishing
the
same
end
would
be
less
burden
on

right
to
travel?
chief

even
if
it

attached

the
only
thing
that
prevents

the
