mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
1961
federal
construction
contract
in
which
additional
work
and
extra
work
doubled
the
original
anticipated
effort.
there
was
an
administrative
appeal
pursued
through
the
atomic
energy
commission
under
the
disputes
process
as
it
is
popularly
called
which
was
won
by
the
contractor
and
accepted
by
the
atomic
energy
commission.
however,
on
its
own
initiative,
the
general
accounting
office
blocked
payment
of
this,
forcing
the
contractor
into
court
of
claims,
and
it
is
from
then
that
the
case
is
here.
in
this
court,
the
department
of
justice
contends
that
the
intervention
in
this
proceeding
on
the
part
of
the
court
of
claims
is
not
material.
we
say
it
is
the
gravament
of
the
entire
situation
and
only
by
a
review
of
all
of
these
circumstances
and
a
consideration
of
the
impact
of
this,
as
well
as,
all
of
these
circumstances
can
the
court
properly
determine
a
solution
to
the
problem
which
has
been
created
by
this.
the
case
involves
the
rights
of
the
contractors,
it
involves
the
finality
of
the
agency
decision,
it
involves
an
interpretation
of
the
so
called
wunderlich
act
of
1954
and
that
we
ask
that
the
court
hold
that
the
finding
by
the
atomic
energy
commission
accepted
by
it
and
not
appealed
by
it
as
such
be
determined
to
be
the
final
action
of
the
government
and
binding
on
the
parties
in
this
case.
reviewing
the
history,
this
was
originally
a
contract
for
a
$1,272,000.00
to
consume
a
180
days
starting
on
august
of
61.
they
would
have
build
a
large
concrete
test
based
at
the
atomic
naval
reactor
test
station
in
idaho.
the
contract
was
not
the
security
classified,
it
was
a
standard
form
2323a
type
of
contract
with
the
usual
(inaudible)
clauses
for
equitable
adjustments
of
changes,
suspension,
the
work,
change
conditions,
and
the
time
extensions
in
the
regular
standard
disputes
clause.
there
were
six
change
orders
which
were
agreed
upon,
an
increased
the
contract
price
by
a
little
over
a
$100,000.00.
however,
the
bulk
of
the
claims
for
additional
work
were
denied
by
the
contracting
officer.
the
work
was
completed
and
accepted
325
days
after
the
original
time
which
of
course
threw
it
into
winter
work
in
the
mountains
of
idaho
in
winter.
the
claims
for
additional
compensation
under
the
then
prevailing
practice
and
rules
of
the
atomic
energy
commission
were
referred
to
a
hearing
examiner.
during
december
of
62,
conducted
at
13
day
full
adversary
hearing.
at
the
conclusion
of
this,
he
found
for
the
contractor,
however,
this
finding
has
never
yet
been
implemented.
the
costs
of
this
work
were
borne
by
the
contractor
and
they
still
remain
unpaid.
the
merits
of
the
claims
as
such
are
not
in
issue,
rather,
it
is
the
treatment
of
the
disposition
of
them
that
is
an
issue.
generally
speaking,
they
are
very
ordinary
type
of
claims,
delay,
inside
access,
additional
concrete
work,
failure
of
the
government
to
furnish
team,
excuses
for
delay
for
unusually
severe
weather,
order
to
accelerate
and
work
around
the
clock
alleging
behind
schedule
when
in
fact
the
time
extension
would
put
the
contractor
on
schedule
and
a
back
field
claim.
following
the
decision
by
the
examiner
for
s&e
contractors,
there
was
an
appeal
by
the
contracting
officer
to
the
commission
itself.
and
there
were
two
decisions
of
the
commission
itself
in
essence
affirming
the
decision
of
the
examiner
making
only
one
minor
modification
that
had
to
do
with
the
number
of
days
and
site
access
when
they
start
out.
in
other
words,
administratively,
there
was
not
only
a
determination
by
the
contracting
officer
and
by
the
examiner
but
the
action
by
the
full
commission
itself.
this
is
addressed
with
the
general
practice
today
throughout
the
government
where
these
cases
are
heard
by
contract
appeal
boards
and
there
is
only
one
administrative
determination.
the
case
was
treated
in
the
court
of
claims
as
being
analogous
to
these
types
of
cases.
while
the
negotiations
were
in
progress
with
respect
to
the
amount
of
the
settlement
as
result
of
these
determinations,
a
certifying
officer
asked
the
general
accounting
office
for
a
ruling
on
$32,000.00
worth
of
items
which
were
not
directly
related
to
these
claims.
however,
the
general
accounting
office
on
its
own
initiative
is
contending
that
it
had
a
right
to
review
the
determinations
as
to
substantial
evidence,
fact,
and
law,
did
so,
conduct
a
review,
and
did
block
the
continuation
of
the
negotiations
and
any
payment.
and
after
33
months
of
consideration,
rendered
a
266
page
opinion
december
of
1966
calling
that
s&e
had
no
valid
claim
against
the
government
and
in
its
own
comments
in
that
brief
of
the
government
before
this
court
today,
in
fact
arising
this
as
an
advance
notice
of
disallowance.
placed
in
this
situation,
the
contractor
brought
suit
in
the
court
of
claims,
a
reference
to
the
commissioner
there
resulted
in
his
opinion
recommending
a
finding
for
s&e
contractors.
this
finding
would
be
based
on
a
breach
of
contract,
failure
to
pay
the
administrative
award
recognizing
that
the
parties
can
contract
for
their
own
remedies,
finding
that
the
general
accounting
office
was
in
excess
of
its
authority,
and
particularly
stressing
that
this
was
an
ordinary
type
of
case
in
which
there
was
no
issue
of
fraud
or
over
reaching
involved.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
yes
sir,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
correct
sir.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
the
matter
was
under
consideration
for
33
months
by
the
general
accounting
office.
during
this
period
of
time,
the
reasons
were
this;
practical
consideration
is
one,
two,
the
hope
that
the
general
accounting
office
could
be
convinced,
one,
that
they
had
no
jurisdiction
and
two,
that
the
findings
were
correct.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
the
law
with
respect
to
the
right
to
claim
a
breach
of
contract
had
certainly
not
evolved
to
a
point
then,
when
you
could
make
a
determination,
and
in
our
judgment,
that
under
those
conditions,
a
breach
had
occurred,
perhaps
this
was
a
judgment
matter.
it
involved
of
course,
a
very
practical
problem
of
contractor
in
these
financial
circumstances,
starting
another
action
in
the
court
of
claims
which
could
easily
have
resulted
in
even
greater
delay.
(inaudible),
it
might
have
been
better
to
do
so
your
honor.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
it
was
between
the
two
decisions
your
honor.
there
was
a
first
decision
of
november
1963
where
the
commission
granted
a
partial
review
and
affirmed
some
of
the
other
claims.
the
partial
review
had
to
do
essentially
with
the
time
extension.
that
was
in
november,
the
request
of
the
gao
was
march
of
1963
and
the
final
decision
of
the
commission
itself
was
may
1963.
following
the
decision
of
the
commissioner,
the
government
sought
request
for
review,
review
was
granted.
the
general
accounting
office
filed
an
amicus
brief
in
the
court
of
claims
and
of
course
the
court
of
claims
opinion
came
down
on
a
4:3
decisions
stating
that
as
of
no
material
difference
how
the
non-payment
came
about.
if
the
case
reached
the
court,
it
would
review
it
under
the
standards
of
the
wunderlich
act.
essentially,
the
standards
there
would
be
the
standards
of
supporting
by
substantial
evidence
that
the
plaintiff
involved
in
this
claims,
and
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
claims
remanded
the
case
to
its
commissioner
for
such
review.
the
dissent
saw
the
case
in
what
we
believe
to
be
the
broader
issues
and
the
important
issues
that
is,
that
is
necessary
for
the
courts
to
give
guidance
and
help
the
machinery
of
the
government
in
handling
disputes
processes
as
we
will
work
out.
it
pointed
out
that
the
atomic
energy
commission
with
the
representative
of
the
government
in
that
case,
that
it
sought
another
review.
the
general
accounting
office
was
not
a
party
and
not
authorized
to
act,
the
department
of
justices,
his
attorney,
was
not
authorized
to
act
in
the
matter
unless,
the
agency
delegated
with
a
responsibility
of
carrying
out
function
sought
its
intercession.
also,
it
was
very
strongly
stressed
that
this
will
have
a
chaotic
effect
on
the
operation
of
the
disputes
clause
which
is
so
essential
to
the
government
as
well
as
to
industry
in
doing
business
with
the
government,
and
that
people
were
entitled
to
certainty,
and
that
under
these
circumstances
with
doubt
existing,
and
with
the
right
existing
apparently
in
various
parties,
to
take
issue
with
the
termination
which
apparently
had
been
resolved
between
the
parties
themselves.
as
judge
collins
in
his
dissents
says
that
the
government
would
be
foolish
to
pay
any
award.
in
this
case,
we
seek
a
holding
that
there
was
a
breach
of
contract
and
the
failure
to
pay
this
award
and
asked
that
the
court
of
claims
be
reversed.
now,
here
the
government
seems
to
disclaim
the
general
accounting
office,
it
asserts
that
its
position
is
independent
of
that.
we
do
not
agree
with
that
in
any
way
whatsoever,
we
feel
as
of
the
gravamen
of
the
case.
the
government
also
claims
that
it
has
an
independent
right
to
set
up
these
defenses
in
a
proceeding
ignoring
what
gave
rise
to
the
proceeding
and
ignoring
altogether
the
impact
of
creating
this
vague,
undefined
procedure
which
gives
absolutely
no
guidance
to
contractors,
government
or
industry
other
than
to
throw
the
whole
procedure
which
has
been
established
over
a
long
period
of
time
into
a
state
of
uncertainty.
the
state
of
uncertainty,
which
will
impact
not
only
upon
contractor
but
upon
bankers,
sureties,
suppliers,
their
subcontractors,
and
others.
this
developed
a
vehicle
for
disputes
clause
has
proved
very
workable
and
very
advantageous
to
government
and
to
contractors
over
a
period
of
years.
it
provides
a
means
whereby
the
governments
work
can
go
forward,
it
can
change
and
improve
the
product
or
the
infrastructure
as
it
sees
fit.
permits
smaller
firms
to
bid,
because
they
finance
the
contract
of
government
fund,
they
pay
90%
as
they
go
along
and
note
that
in
the
changes
and
disputes
article,
the
contractor
must
proceed
right
there.
this
power
requiring
a
contractor
to
proceed
as
the
contract
is
interpreted
by
the
government
is
the
key
to
the
whole
thing
and
the
key
to
what
happened
here.
he
had
an
obligation
to
go
forward
and
do
this
work
even
though
his
work
was
doubled
and
even
though
he
was
barely
able
to
fund
it.
if
a
decision
is
subject
to
a
collateral
attack,
that
certainly
no
longer
exist
and
parties
will
no
longer
in
our
judgment
want
to
cover
government
work
or
if
they
do
so
they
will
set
up
large
contingencies
in
any
bid
they
make
and
it
will
disadvantage
everyone.
this
court
has
held
repeatedly
that
the
parties
have
the
right
to
contract
for
their
own
remedies.
the
uncertainty
that
arises
from
this
goes
to
the
fact
that
when
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
1951
and
to
and
the
moorman
and
the
wunderlich
cases
were
decided,
the
court
in
effect
announced
this
principle
and
invited
congress
to
change
the
standards
from
that
broad
being
the
sole
ground
of
review
as
established
by
those
decisions.
congress
did
and
passed
this
act
which
is
negative
in
nature,
not
jurisdictional.
it
does
not
give
powers
to
anyone,
it
merely
says
that
no
provision
of
a
contract
can
limit
the
judicial
review
to
cases
where
fraud
is
alleged
provided
that
the
decisions
of
the
heads
of
an
agency
will
be
final
unless
they
are
fraudulent
or
capricious
or
arbitrary
or
grossly
erroneous,
so
as
to
imply
bad
faith
or
is
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence,
and
that
no
contract
shall
have
a
provision
making
a
decision
of
an
official,
final,
and
plastered
into
the
wall.
the
interpretation
of
this
presents
a
very
perfecting
clause
so
acknowledged
by
anyone
who
has
had
to
deal
with
it.
in
the
initial
hearings,
when
it
was
proposed
that
an
act
fee
set
up,
that
there
was
provision
in
the
bill
then
proposed
that
a
comptroller
general
be
set
up
as
a
layer
of
review
along
with
courts
of
competent
jurisdiction.
objection
was
made
to
this
by
industry,
by
attorneys
and
by
officials
of
the
government
agencies
who
were
concerned
of
creating
another
layer
of
review
and
impacting
on
their
ability
to
implement
the
government’s
business.
that
provision
was
taken
out
of
the
bill
and
in
the
summation
of
the
report,
the
final
draft
of
the
bill
that
it
stated
very
clearly
that
there
was
no
intention
to
change
the
powers
of
the
general
accounting
office.
it
is
most
difficult
to
separate
the
position
of
the
government
and
the
general
accounting
office
and
we
say
they
are
inseparable.
we
say
it
was
invasive
that
the
general
accounting
officer
would
have
certain
powers
to
intercede
in
these
proceedings.
we
believe
it
was
intended
that
they
be
limited
to
the
powers
that
they
had
before
the
wunderlich
act
in
54,
was
not
adopted.
and
we
believe
that
those
powers
only
relate
to
protect
the
government
from
fraud
and
overreaching
or
with
respect
to
anything
which
would
be
of
an
auditing
nature.
in
other
words,
matters
having
to
do
with
physical
aspects
of
the
law
and
not
matters
having
to
with
the
substance
of
the
contract
itself.
on
that,
we
say
that
the
atomic
energy
commission
has
confidence
by
many
decisions
of
this
court
is
the
empowered
sole
authorized
agent
of
the
government
and
not
only
by
the
law,
the
atomic
energy
--
excuse
me?
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
that
is
correct.
now,
i
answer
that
this
way.
the
department
takes
the
position
in
this
brief,
in
this
court.
that
the
acquiescence
in
the
opinion
of
the
comptroller
general
of
december
66
constitutes
an
action,
we
would
say
otherwise.
we
say
that
practically
speaking,
being
told
by
your
banker
you
have
no
more
money
and
acting
accordingly,
plus
being
susceptible,
being
personally
back-charged
for
payments
so
made
does
not
create
an
independent
action.
further,
the
letter
which
is
exhibit
a
of
the
petition
on
page
10
of
the
appendix
clearly
indicates
that
the
commission
says,
it
will
take
no
action
inconsistent
with
the
ruling
of
the
comptroller
general.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
no
your
honor.
the
department
of
justice
represented
the
united
states
in
the
court
of
claims.
the
general
accounting
office
participated
in
the
court
of
claims.
two
more
points.
one,
there
is
no
need
for
the
general
accounting
office
to
be
involved
in
this
case.
the
government
is
completely
protecting
the
atomic
energy
commission
as
the
management,
technical,
legal,
staff.
in
this
instance
they
had
an
extended
set
of
review,
three
decisions
at
three
levels,
the
normal
case
that
is
sufficient.
they
will
undoubtedly,
under
these
circumstances,
that
the
governments
occasionally,
there
were
mistakes
made
in
favor
of
the
contractors,
mistakes
made
in
favor
of
the
government.
but
this
is
the
way
a
$50
billion
per
annum
business
has
to
work.
by
and
large
absence
and
propriety,
those
provisions
have
proved
the
advantage
of
everyone
and
should
be
permitted
to
stand.
if
i
may
address
it
in
this
context
your
honor.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
thank
you
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
just
question
one
or
two
things
that
the
assistant
to
the
attorney
general
had
said
and
make
final
comment.
with
respect
to
the
recitation
of
the
history
of
the
wunderlich
act
and
the
exchange
between
congressman
willis
and
franklin
schultz
is
where
we
have
on
page
8
of
our
reply
brief
continued
the
discussion
which
the
government
had
worked
to
point
it
out
there.
in
the
final
exchange,
mr.
willis
said
to
mr.
schultz,
this
judicial
review
referred
to
in
that
passage
there
referring
to
a
review
by
the
gao.
and
gao
has
been
left
deliberately
out
as
compared
to
s24
or
that
is
persuasive
sir.
in
other
words,
the
exchange
was
not
included
in
the
government’s
brief
or
in
the
government’s
comments
here.
with
respect
to
the
opinion
of
the
comptroller
general,
it
is
pointed
out
in
that
as
well
as
in
its
old
comments
which
are
in
the
appendix
to
the
government
brief
in
this
case,
that
s&e
contractors
had
no
valid
claim
against
the
government,
they
are
quoting
in
the
appendix
here
their
determination.
also,
as
i
have
stated
previously,
they
could
describe
that
action
as
an
advanced
disallowance
of
the
payment.
the
government
has
undertaken
to
state
that
we,
state
that
the
government
has
no
rights
in
situations
other
than
fraud.
our
position
is
not
advisable,
our
position
is
that,
the
government’s
rights
have
been
properly
protected
by
the
agency,
truly
qualify
personnel
and
legal
staffs
under
normal
circumstances
that
deal
with
the
routine
business.
and
that
the
certainty
and
finality
and
the
powers
of
that
agency
to
deal
with
commissions
and
responsibilities
assigned
to
it
demand
the
government
and
for
contractors
that
it
carry
out
those
powers
without
being
susceptible
to
collateral
attack
in
ordinary
circumstances.
no
one
has
ever
denied
and
indeed
the
justice
department
has
brought
out
in
the
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
in
1969
that
it
has
a
common
law
right
to
pursue
whatever
remedies
exist
for
payments
under
mistake
of
the
law
or
mistake
of
the
fact.
the
reference
to
the
langenfelder
case,
i
respectfully
disagree
with
two.
there
are
one
or
two
cases
cited
in
the
langenfelder
opinion
where
in
the
dictum,
judge
davis
did
make
some
comments
with
respect
to
the
powers
of
the
general
accounting
office.
however,
an
examination
of
those
cases
would
show
that
none
of
them
was
in
any
such
a
review
as
this
ever
conducted.
in
other
words,
a
comprehensive
review
of
a
complicated
interrelated
claim
essentially
involving
questions
under
the
contract.
one
of
the
cases
said
in
the
langenfelder
involved
a
back
charge
after
termination
and
other
required
the
right
to
recover
back
interest
from
the
contract
of
which
he
had
recovered
from
the
state
of
california
under
an
agreement
where
there
was
cost
plus
contract.
but
in
no
case,
was
there
a
comprehensive
and
factual
review
such
as
this.
and
in
fact,
in
the
decisions
of
the
court
of
claims,
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
that
issue
has
not
been
raised
with
respect
to
this
point.
we
raise
the
issue
not
because
we
are
here
to
tell
the
government
how
it
should
be
run,
we
would
rather
not,
we
would
rather,
you
collected
our
money
in
1961
or
2
or
at
least
in
1964
and
going
on
about
our
business.
instead,
we
lie
here
inert
while
other
agencies
assert
what
we
conceive
to
be
essentially
abstract
powers.
the
government
has
complete
control
of
the
government
contract,
the
regulations
and
indeed
congress,
overall
interpreted
by
this
court.
if
they
wanted
to
as
the
department
of
transportation
has
recently
done
and
set
up
the
precise
vehicle
for
a
review
of
instant,
board
of
contract
appeal’s
decision,
they
can
do
so.
but
in
doing
so,
i
think
it
will
destroy
the
efficacy
of
the
changes,
clause
and
the
disputes
procedure,
and
it
did
affect
and
detract
contractor’s
interest
in
participating
in
government
works.
i
seriously
question
whether
the
agency's
desire
the
result
of
which
the
court
of
claims,
majority
opinion
would
yield
in
this
case.
where
does
the
powers
stop?
this
court
has
said
clearly
and
unequivocally
in
the
mason
&
hanger
in
the
amnesty
cases
where
there
is
a
delegation
of
a
factor
like
function
to
represent
it
to
the
united
states
is
not
going
to
be
challenged
by
any
one
or
that
the
department
expressly
ruled
in
that
case.
this
un-presented
action
of
work
is
a
disaster
in
this
contract.
it
spent
ten
years
flat
on
its
back,
unable
to
proceed,
still
not
repaid
for
the
money
expanded.
i
ask
this
court
to
deal
with
the
whole
problem
to
restore
the
disputes
process
to
the
manner
in
which
it
has
judicially
worth
and
which
will
adhere
to
the
benefit,
contract,
as
government
and
the
like.
thank
you
very
much
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
also
here
for
re-argument,
and
it
comes
from
the
united
states
court
of
claims.
it
involves
the
finality
under
a
1961
federal
construction
contract
of
an
administrative
disputes
decision
favorable
to
the
contractor,
allowing
payment
for
certain
routine
contract
changes,
which
decision
was
accepted
by
the
contractor
and
by
the
agency,
the
atomic
energy
commission.
what
was
collaterally
attacked
by
the
comptroller
general
on
his
own
initiative
precluding
payment
and
forcing
us
to
suit
in
the
court
of
claims.
there
is
no
issue
as
to
the
authority
to
enter
the
contract,
obligate
funds
or
indeed
to
conduct
the
disputes
process.
neither
is
there
any
allegation
of
any
fraud,
wrongdoing
or
impropriety
whatsoever
on
the
part
of
anyone
connected
with
the
contractor
or
the
aec.
the
matter
is
simply
one
in
which
we
say
the
comptroller
general
in
an
overreaching
of
his
powers
has
blocked
payment
of
the
resolution
of
this
matter
under
the
disputes
process,
forcing
the
contractor
into
litigation.
the
department
of
justice
here,
takes
the
position
that
the
action
of
the
comptroller
general
is
immaterial
and
although
it
is
not
supported
by
the
atomic
energy
commission
in
it's
pursuit
of
this,
nevertheless
contends
that
this
creates
a
right
of
judicial
review
of
this
procedure.
the
case
was
decided
by
the
court
of
claims
in
a
4
to
3
opinion,
the
majority
holding
that
regardless
of
what
precipitated
the
litigation,
there
would
be
a
judicial
review
conducted
under
the
standards
of
the
wunderlich
act
of
1954.
and
the
case
was
remanded
to
the
commissioner
of
the
court
of
claims
for
hearing
on
the
merits.
therefore
the
case
is
not
here
on
the
merits
as
such,
but
on
the
question
of
the
finality
of
this
determination
under
the
disputes
process
and
the
rights
of
the
contract,
to
which
he
is
asserting
to
hold
that
disputes
process
having
been
accepted
by
the
agency
was
final.
and
it
is
not
subject
to
collateral
attack.
the
case
therefore
involves
a
contract
between
the
agencies
and
an
interpretation
of
this
wunderlich
act.
if
i
may
briefly
review
the
history
of
the
case
itself,
it
is
laid
out
as
a
chronology
on
page
one
of
the
appendix.
it
was
a
lump
sum
competitively
bid
federal
construction
contract
to
build
a
portion
of
the
atomic
reactive
test
station
for
the
navy
in
idaho.
the
original
sum
was
$1,272,000
and
the
contract
performance
period
was
180
days
or
to
run
from
august
1961
to
february
1962.
the
contract
was
entered
into
on
a
us
standard
form
23,
23a
and
so
forth,
well
with
the
contact
of
the
1953
edition
with
the
normal
and
usual
act,
with
adjustment
clauses
for
changes,
change
conditions
and
other
factors
in
the
contact.
it
worked,
however,
due
to
extra
work
and
extra
time,
actually
consumed
325
days
or
in
effect
approximately
double
the
time
of
performance
and
the
expenditures
involved.
six
claims
arose
out
of
this
and
amounting
to
$1,950,000
and
claims
for
an
additional
120
days
in
time
extensions.
they
are
routine
claims.
nothing
extraordinary
other
than
the
magnitude
of
them
in
relation
to
the
basic
contract
and
the
type
of
thing
that
is
encountered
in
almost
all
federal
construction
contacts.
denied
by
the
contracting
officer,
a
timely
appeal
taken,
they
were
referred
by
the
atomic
energy
commission
under
it's
then
existing
practice
to
an
examiner,
who
heard
in
a
13-day
hearing,
the
claims
in
an
adversary
proceeding
found
in
december
of
1962,
for
the
appellant
here
on
liability.
the
matter
was
remanded
by
him
to
the
contacting
officer
to
negotiate
quantum.
the
contacting
officer
appealed
to
the
commission
itself.
this
proceeding
to
this
extent
being
a
little
different
from
your
normal
board
of
contract
appeals
type
of
proceeding
which
is
prevalent
throughout
most
of
the
federal
departments
today.
the
full
commission
--
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
sir
today,
they
have
a
board
of
contract
appeals,
just
as
does
the
department
of
defense
does,
yes
sir.
on
november
1963,
the
full
commission
reaffirmed
some
of
the
claims
and
granted
a
review
by
the
full
commission
on
several,
mostly
pertaining
to
time
extensions.
in
may
14,
1963,
the
commission
itself
in
a
formal
act
affirmed
the
claims
other
than
a
slight
modification
on
one
regarding
time
of
site
access
which
it
remanded
for
negotiation,
and
directed
the
contract
--
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
by
the
atomic
energy
commission
board
of
contract
appeals
which
is
very
much
like
the
counter
part
of
the
armed
services
board
of
contract
appeals,
yes
sir,
your
honor.
there
was
this
remand
to
the
contracting
officer
again
in
may
of
1963
then
by
the
full
commission,
but
in
the
meanwhile
the
dispersing
officer
had
addressed
an
inquiry
to
the
general
accounting
office
regarding
certain
set
offs
involving
about
$32,000,
items
which
were
independent
of
the
merits
of
the
claims
themselves,
so
found
by
the
commissioner
of
court
of
claims
who
reported
on
this.
but
the
request
which
went
to
the
general
accounting
office
expressly
stated
that
it
was
not
to
be
construed
as
a
request
for
a
review
of
or
concurrence
in
the
decision.
nevertheless
the
general
accounting
office
did
contending
that
it
had
a
right
acting
in
an
executive
capacity
and
under
the
standard
of
the
wunderlich
act
to
review
the
entire
decision,
did
so
taking
33
months
to
do
it
and
in
a
260-page
opinion,
set
aside
the
entire
decision.
it
allowed
not
one
set,
it
allowed
not
one
day's
time
extension
and
in
it's
own
papers
filed
in
these
proceedings,
it
characterizes
this
action
as
an
advanced
notice
of
dis-allowance.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
perhaps
i
inadvertently
used
the
word
set
aside,
i
should
have
said,
they
simply
blocked
the
payment
of
this
taking
the
position
that
the
contractor
was
not
entitled
to
any
compensation
and
--
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
i
would
suppose
they
would
be
subjected
to
the
possible
charges
personally
or
their
bond
being
charged
by
the
comptroller
general,
with
the
amount
so
dispersed
if
his
position
had
--
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
sir,
the
amount
claimed
was
$1,950,000.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
well
there
was
never
an
agreed
settlement.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
the
examiner
found
liability,
the
commissioner
affirmed
liability
--
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
the
amount
had
not
been
resolved.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
it
was
in
negotiation,
the
amount
claimed
was
of
$1,950,000.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
correct
sir,
or
a
liability
under
bonds
or
the
dispersing
officer
might
have
run
that
risk.
that
is
not
altogether
[attempt
to
laughter]
clear
to
me
to
the
full
extent
of
that
--
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
it
would
be
as
we
view
it,
a
total
deterrent
to
making
a
dispersion.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
agreed,
quite
agreed,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
sir
the
petitioner
is
not
in
business.
he
has
been
unable
to
continue
in
business
ever
since
this.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
i
would
say
there
is
no
--
nothing
in
the
record
itself
to
this
effect,
bearing
in
mind
sir,
that
the
record
as
such
can
only
be
the
record
of
the
atomic
energy
commission
[attempt
to
laughter]
proceeding
as
reviewed
under
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
proceeding
in
the
court
of
claims.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
under
the
present
state
of
the
law,
no
sir.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
no
it
cannot.
there
have
been
some
decisions
in
recent
years
which
have
enabled
the
court
of
claims
to
recognize
that
in
an
overhead
expense
certain
interest
occurring
during
a
period
of
extended
overhead
while
that
work
was
being
performed,
but
there
is
no
basis
for
allowing
interest
for
the
period
beyond
the
time
when
the
contract
was
completed
which
was
of
course
in
1962.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
i'd
think
it
would.
there
is
a
remote
possibility
[attempt
to
laughter]
that
had
been
discussed
that
one
might
go
for
an
amendment
without
consideration
under
public
law
87653,
but
i
--
that
these
unprecedented
of
this,
simply
serving
as
run
through
i
think.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
correct.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
none
whatsoever,
sir.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
it
is
a
published
opinion
and
therefore
we
feel
free
to
refer
to
it
because
it's
in
the
opinions
of
the
comptroller
general.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
but
the
issue
in
this
suit,
once
we
have
brought
it
in
the
court
of
claims.
it
came
to
an
issue
on
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
yes.
but
it
should
be
noted
that
in
the
court
of
claims
not
only
the
department
of
justice,
but
an
attorney
from
the
general
accounting
office
appeared
with
the
government.
at
a
later
point
they
diverted
it
and
we
faced
with
more
than
one
adversary,
but
initially,
in
the
initial
motion,
it
was
a
filed
not
only
by
the
department,
but
by
the
--
joined
in
by
the
comptroller
general.
if
i
may
discuss
the
court
of
claims
proceeding
where
the
brief
--
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
they
have
reviewed
it
as
i
understand
it
on
the
basis
of
saying
that
it
was
a
review
as
to
whether
the
decision
of
the
aec
affirming
the
examiner's
decision
was
supported
by
substantial
evidence
and
whether
it
was
correct
as
a
matter
of
law
and
they
found,
it
was
not.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
negative.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
absolutely,
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
practically
speaking
that
is
correct,
yes
sir.
(inaudible)
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
i
think
the
dispersing
officer
would
have
been
within
his
own
rights
to
independently
refuse
to
make
that,
at
the
direction
--
either
of
his
superior.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
i
quite
agree.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
yes.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
historically
and
particularly
in
the
period
of
the
19th
century,
there
were
numerous
cases
and
some
in
this
century
where
the
attorney
general
took
entirely
different
view
of
the
rights
of
the
comptroller
general
and
specifically
held
that
in
matters
vested
in
the
discretion
of
the
administrative
official
that
he
had
no
right
to
superimpose
his
judgment.
and
one
of
the
big
issues
in
this
case
will
be
whether
that
was
altered
by
the
wunderlich
act.
in
other
words,
this
court
in
mason
&
hanger,
very
clearly
held
that
comptroller
general
had
no
right
to
adjudicate.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
yes.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
i
think
that
--
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
i
think
that's
correct,
but
our
point
here
is,
that
there
would
be
no
case
on
which
to
make
such
a
determination
were
not
for
the
improper,
unwarranted
and
illegal
act
of
the
comptroller
general.
in
fact
you
go
back
just
a
second
to
proceeding
in
the
court
of
claims,
i
think
it's
important
to
bring
out,
that
having
been
referred
to
the
commissioner
first,
he
made
a
recommendation
to
the
court,
that
the
court
find
that
this
was
a
breach
of
contract
and
that
it
render
summary
judgment.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
if
the
dispersing
officer
had
refused
to
pay
in
accordance
with
the
--
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
i
believe
not,
because
i
think
it
would
have
been
taken
away
from
him
by
the
action
of
the
commission
by
which
he
would
be
bound
since
there
is
a
formal
act
as
the
commission
and
the
hypothetical
situation
you
are
projecting
as
i
understand
it
would
entail
a
reversal
of
position
on
the
part
of
the
commission
itself
or
its
representative
--
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
if
such
a
situation
were
to
occur
then
i
would
suppose
in
due
course
if
we
were
unable
to
resolve
it,
we
would
have
the
possibilities
of
either
seeking
mandamus
action
which
has
been
done
in
some
cases,
where
it
involved
simply
a
ministerial
action
to
carry
out
an
obligation
of
the
united
states,
or
the
possibility
of
bringing
an
action
in
the
court
of
claims.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
in
either
event,
the
attorney
general
would
have
the
responsibility
defending
a
suit
against
the
united
states
--
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
well,
this
is
a
procedure
which
actually
the
attorney
general
suggested
in
that
opinion
of
january,
1969,
which
we
took
such
strong
issue.
in
other
words,
in
effect
he
suggested
that
anyone
within
the
government,
who
was
not
satisfied
had
the
right
to
short
circuit
it
[attempt
to
laughter],
if
you
will,
the
disputes
process
and
throw
the
thing
into
litigation
whereby
the
contractor
who
was
playing
by
the
government's
rules
accepted
this
onerous
contract
with
all
the
incumbent
responsibilities
of
caring
forth
changes,
that
is
expensive,
of
carrying
forward
at
his
expense
in
accordance
with
the
contracting
officer's
determination,
while
the
dispute
is
being
resolved
that
he
would
still
have
the
additional
onus,
having
one
of
carrying
on
this
litigation.
now
that
is
not
the
way
the
disputes
process
works.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
quite
--
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
absolute
case
of
insubordination
because
in
this
situation
by
statute
the
atomic
energy
commission
is
the
delegated
representative
of
the
government
and
in
this
situation
the
commission
itself
has
acted,
has
made
a
determination
and
that
determination
has
never
yet
been
altered.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
i
agree
with
that
theory.
now
in
fact
the
commissioner
white's
opinion
in
the
court
of
claims
held
that
this
non
payment
in
our
case
constituted
a
breach
of
contract
because
the
remedies
as
suggested
--
as
required
were
not
carried
out
were
unavailable.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
i
could
say
it
took
[attempt
to
laughter]
a
long
time
in
this
case
mr.
justice
douglas.
one
of
our
problems
in
this
case
of
course
is
that
s&e
contractors
are
taking
on
that
one
but
three
adversaries
really
in
a
sense,
although
we
have
no
conflict
with
the
atomic
energy
commission
at
this
point
in
time.
we
do
have
problems
on
the
one
hand
of
the
comptroller
general
and
on
the
other
hand
with
the
attorney
general.
as
i
started
to
say
a
little
bit
ago
in
the
initial
proceedings
in
the
court
of
claims,
they
were
together.
later
after
the
commissioner
found
for
s&e
and
after
we
filed
--
excuse
me,
the
government
jointly
filed
a
brief
seeking
review
and
we
responded,
they
split
and
took
different
positions
and
filed
a
amicus
brief
on
behalf
of
the
comptroller
general
asserting
different
positions
from
those
which
the
department
of
justice
had
asserted.
the
department
of
justice
seem
to
bottom
its
case
on
this
nebulous
right
of
making
independent
review
notwithstanding
the
circumstances
of
how
the
matter
came
about.
it
is
our
position
that
you
simply
cannot
arrive
at
such
a
situation
without
giving
recognition
to
and
approval
of
what
it
is
a
breach
of
contract
and
an
illegal
act,
the
failure
on
the
part
of
the
agency
of
united
states,
the
atomic
energy
commission
to
carry
out
it's
agreement
with
this
contractor.
and
from
time
immemorial,
this
court
has
recognized
the
rights
of
encouraged
parties
to
provide
methods
whereby
they
could
resolve
their
own
disputes.
in
the
case
of
the
government,
this
has
been
recognized
particularly
in
jone’s
case
120
years
ago
as
well
as
in
the
mason
&
hanger
case
to
which
i
adverted
to
a
little
while
ago
which
both
specifically
involved
an
attempt
by
the
comptroller
general
to
overrule
the
head
of
an
agency
on
a
routine
contract
matter
and
there
this
court
held
that
there
was
no
such
power.
now
was
this
authored
by
the
wunderlich
act;
remember
that
case,
excuse
me
that
act
came
about
as
a
result
of
two
decisions
of
this
court
in
1950
and
1951
whereby
this
court
in
upholding
the
rights
of
parties
to
contract
for
their
own
remedies
said
that
they
have
contracted
the
way
the
right
to
judicial
review.
in
the
moorman
case
involving
questions
of
law
and
in
the
wunderlich
case
involving
questions
of
fact,
the
court
suggested
that
the
congress
felt
a
different
standard
should
be
applied,
it
was
a
matter
for
congress
to
undertake.
congress
did
enact
this
wunderlich
act,
we
have
it
on
page
3
and
21
of
our
own
petition,
it's
short
--
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
we
have
cited
the
jone’s
case
in
1850,
yes.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
correct.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
yes.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
excuse
me.
what
exception?
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
yes,
it
actually
came
about
more
or
less
concurrently
because
in
wunderlich
decision,
you
had
said
--
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
i
regard
it
it
as
analogous
to
a
situation
in
the
private
contract
where
there
is
fraud
--
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
yes.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
it
has
been
characterized
as
a
tantamount
to
arbitration
by
some
although
we
see
it
does
not
keep
it
all
the
time.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
it
is
not
enforceable
if
you
please
mr.
justice
brennan
because
there
was
no
effort
to
enforce
it
on
the
part
of
the
official
and
the
government,
the
atomic
energy
commission.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
it
is
on
page
3
or
21
of
our
brief.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
none
your
honor.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
yes,
yes
it
runs
(voice
overlap)
i
am
sorry,
i
didn't.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
sir,
if
you
take
the
exact
wording
of
the
clause,
it's
plainly
intended
only
to
provide
for
the
contractor
because
it
says
the
decision
shall
be
final
and
conclusive
unless
the
contractor
may
also
or
otherwise
furnishes
a
contract
--
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
no,
it
is
not
sir.
i
am
just
saying,
the
government
cannot
attack
under
this
clause,
the
decision
of
the
contracting
officer
and
of
the
commissioner.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
no
fraud.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
yes
it
is.
but
this
clause
in
its
application
has
always
been
construed
as
only
for
writing
--
for
a
means
for
a
contractor
to
go
forward
with
these
appeals.
it
is
--
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
it
could
for
fraud.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
clause
which
is
in
question
here
of
course
was
not
the
one
(inaudible)
clause,
which
is
a
little
different.
this
is
the
clause
for
our
contract
and
we
are
--
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
yes
it
is
the
clause
under
our
contract
and
--
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
the
word
negotiated
[attempt
to
laughter]
has
broad
implications
--
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
it's
correct,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
conclude
by
saying
that
i
feel
that
this
case
is
one
in
which
the
broad
aspects
of
this
entire
problem,
the
application
of
the
disputes
process,
its
value
to
the
government
and
contracting
industry
should
be
given
very
serious
consideration.
that
the
power
to
control
the
incidence
of
contract
including
this
should
be
limited
to
those
of
the
using
agency,
that
it
determine
it
traditionally
although
the
construction
might
indicate
the
power
existed
by
the
government
to
process
this.
in
fact,
over
years
there
is
no
background
or
no
experience
of
it
having
been
done,
that
the
government
has
the
power
to
write
contracts
and
regulations
to
give
itself
powers
of
review
which
it
did
not
do
so
here.
and
that
it
would
be
a
last
time
done
to
this
contract
as
well
as
to
the
entire
contracting
industry,
if
this
case
is
not
overruled.
thank
you.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
yes
sir,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
as
i
reach
the
background
of
that
mr.
justice
blackmun,
the
intention
of
putting
that
reference
to
throw
in
there
and
is
brought
out
in
the
amicus
brief
of
the
american
bar
was
to
expressly
overcome,
restrict
standards
established
by
this
court
in
limiting
a
contractor's
right
over
due.
in
the
wunderlich
decision,
the
cases
where
fraud
was
alleged,
said
that
shall
not
be
limited
to
that
and
that
the
same
nevertheless
shall
be
presumed
final
unless
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence
as
well
as
not
fulfilling
the
other
four
standards
as
set
out
in
the
later
part
of
that
article.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
a
study
of
the
intent
history
of
the
wunderlich
act
will
disclose
that
the
comptroller
general
in
the
82nd
congress
having
sought
to
and
having
been
included
expressly
in
a
bill
as
a
tier
of
review
--
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
that
is
--
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
in
the
82nd
congress,
when
the
bill
was
under
consideration
that
he
would
be
included,
he
was.
strong
objection
--
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
oh!
yes.
(voice
overlap)
82nd
and
that's
the
one
i
don't
know
who
wrote.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
provision
for
the
comptroller
general
represented
a
compromise
proposed
by
him,
correct
mr.
justice
brennan.
due
to
objections
raised
by
the
department
of
the
defense
contractors
and
others
that
they
would
create
this
additional
tier
of
review
which
is
proved
so
awkward
in
this
situation.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
and
his
letter
which
i
have
in
the
house
report
1380,
says
and
in
effect,
it
is
intended
--
it
is
not
intended
to
be
the
change
the
jurisdiction
or
to
grant
any
new
jurisdiction
or
to
recognize
the
jurisdiction
which
he
has.
what
we
say
is
not
intended.
now
with
respect
to
the
overall
intent
of
the
act
one,
we
don't
believe
that
it
was
ever
intended
any
using
agency
would
attack
its
own
decisions
by
fraud.
with
respect
to
fraud,
otherwise
there
are
always
remedies
available
to
the
government
and
otherwise
but
the
procedure
as
it
has
been
afforded
here
to
just
take
away
from
the
disputes
process
it's
efficacy
is
simply
calamitous
within
the
operation
of
the
system
as
it
now
works.
when
a
contractor
signs
a
government
contract,
and
he
agrees
to
the
changes
clause
and
do
the
work
as
its
changed
and
he
agrees
to
the
disputes
clause,
he
says
he
will
keep
right,
i
am
going
to
his
expects
as
the
government
interprets
the
contract
and
which
he
did
here,
that
i
think
the
quid
pro
quo
involved
there
of
those
unlimited
powers
being
granted
to
the
government,
and
the
government
given
its
right
of
decision
itself.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
1961
federal
construction
contract
in
which
additional
work
and
extra
work
doubled
the
original
anticipated
effort.
there
was
an
administrative
appeal
pursued
through
the
atomic
energy
commission
under
the
disputes
process
as
it
is
popularly
called
which
was
won
by
the
contractor
and
accepted
by
the
atomic
energy
commission.
however,
on
its
own
initiative,
the
general
accounting
office
blocked
payment
of
this,
forcing
the
contractor
into
court
of
claims,
and
it
is
from
then
that
the
case
is
here.
in
this
court,
the
department
of
justice
contends
that
the
intervention
in
this
proceeding
on
the
part
of
the
court
of
claims
is
not
material.
we
say
it
is
the
gravament
of
the
entire
situation
and
only
by
a
review
of
all
of
these
circumstances
and
a
consideration
of
the
impact
of
this,
as
well
as,
all
of
these
circumstances
can
the
court
properly
determine
a
solution
to
the
problem
which
has
been
created
by
this.
the
case
involves
the
rights
of
the
contractors,
it
involves
the
finality
of
the
agency
decision,
it
involves
an
interpretation
of
the
so
called
wunderlich
act
of
1954
and
that
we
ask
that
the
court
hold
that
the
finding
by
the
atomic
energy
commission
accepted
by
it
and
not
appealed
by
it
as
such
be
determined
to
be
the
final
action
of
the
government
and
binding
on
the
parties
in
this
case.
reviewing
the
history,
this
was
originally
a
contract
for
a
$1,272,000.00
to
consume
a
180
days
starting
on
august
of
61.
they
would
have
build
a
large
concrete
test
based
at
the
atomic
naval
reactor
test
station
in
idaho.
the
contract
was
not
the
security
classified,
it
was
a
standard
form
2323a
type
of
contract
with
the
usual
(inaudible)
clauses
for
equitable
adjustments
of
changes,
suspension,
the
work,
change
conditions,
and
the
time
extensions
in
the
regular
standard
disputes
clause.
there
were
six
change
orders
which
were
agreed
upon,
an
increased
the
contract
price
by
a
little
over
a
$100,000.00.
however,
the
bulk
of
the
claims
for
additional
work
were
denied
by
the
contracting
officer.
the
work
was
completed
and
accepted
325
days
after
the
original
time
which
of
course
threw
it
into
winter
work
in
the
mountains
of
idaho
in
winter.
the
claims
for
additional
compensation
under
the
then
prevailing
practice
and
rules
of
the
atomic
energy
commission
were
referred
to
a
hearing
examiner.
during
december
of
62,
conducted
at
13
day
full
adversary
hearing.
at
the
conclusion
of
this,
he
found
for
the
contractor,
however,
this
finding
has
never
yet
been
implemented.
the
costs
of
this
work
were
borne
by
the
contractor
and
they
still
remain
unpaid.
the
merits
of
the
claims
as
such
are
not
in
issue,
rather,
it
is
the
treatment
of
the
disposition
of
them
that
is
an
issue.
generally
speaking,
they
are
very
ordinary
type
of
claims,
delay,
inside
access,
additional
concrete
work,
failure
of
the
government
to
furnish
team,
excuses
for
delay
for
unusually
severe
weather,
order
to
accelerate
and
work
around
the
clock
alleging
behind
schedule
when
in
fact
the
time
extension
would
put
the
contractor
on
schedule
and
a
back
field
claim.
following
the
decision
by
the
examiner
for
s&e
contractors,
there
was
an
appeal
by
the
contracting
officer
to
the
commission
itself.
and
there
were
two
decisions
of
the
commission
itself
in
essence
affirming
the
decision
of
the
examiner
making
only
one
minor
modification
that
had
to
do
with
the
number
of
days
and
site
access
when
they
start
out.
in
other
words,
administratively,
there
was
not
only
a
determination
by
the
contracting
officer
and
by
the
examiner
but
the
action
by
the
full
commission
itself.
this
is
addressed
with
the
general
practice
today
throughout
the
government
where
these
cases
are
heard
by
contract
appeal
boards
and
there
is
only
one
administrative
determination.
the
case
was
treated
in
the
court
of
claims
as
being
analogous
to
these
types
of
cases.
while
the
negotiations
were
in
progress
with
respect
to
the
amount
of
the
settlement
as
result
of
these
determinations,
a
certifying
officer
asked
the
general
accounting
office
for
a
ruling
on
$32,000.00
worth
of
items
which
were
not
directly
related
to
these
claims.
however,
the
general
accounting
office
on
its
own
initiative
is
contending
that
it
had
a
right
to
review
the
determinations
as
to
substantial
evidence,
fact,
and
law,
did
so,
conduct
a
review,
and
did
block
the
continuation
of
the
negotiations
and
any
payment.
and
after
33
months
of
consideration,
rendered
a
266
page
opinion
december
of
1966
calling
that
s&e
had
no
valid
claim
against
the
government
and
in
its
own
comments
in
that
brief
of
the
government
before
this
court
today,
in
fact
arising
this
as
an
advance
notice
of
disallowance.
placed
in
this
situation,
the
contractor
brought
suit
in
the
court
of
claims,
a
reference
to
the
commissioner
there
resulted
in
his
opinion
recommending
a
finding
for
s&e
contractors.
this
finding
would
be
based
on
a
breach
of
contract,
failure
to
pay
the
administrative
award
recognizing
that
the
parties
can
contract
for
their
own
remedies,
finding
that
the
general
accounting
office
was
in
excess
of
its
authority,
and
particularly
stressing
that
this
was
an
ordinary
type
of
case
in
which
there
was
no
issue
of
fraud
or
over
reaching
involved.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
yes
sir,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
correct
sir.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
the
matter
was
under
consideration
for
33
months
by
the
general
accounting
office.
during
this
period
of
time,
the
reasons
were
this;
practical
consideration
is
one,
two,
the
hope
that
the
general
accounting
office
could
be
convinced,
one,
that
they
had
no
jurisdiction
and
two,
that
the
findings
were
correct.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
the
law
with
respect
to
the
right
to
claim
a
breach
of
contract
had
certainly
not
evolved
to
a
point
then,
when
you
could
make
a
determination,
and
in
our
judgment,
that
under
those
conditions,
a
breach
had
occurred,
perhaps
this
was
a
judgment
matter.
it
involved
of
course,
a
very
practical
problem
of
contractor
in
these
financial
circumstances,
starting
another
action
in
the
court
of
claims
which
could
easily
have
resulted
in
even
greater
delay.
(inaudible),
it
might
have
been
better
to
do
so
your
honor.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
it
was
between
the
two
decisions
your
honor.
there
was
a
first
decision
of
november
1963
where
the
commission
granted
a
partial
review
and
affirmed
some
of
the
other
claims.
the
partial
review
had
to
do
essentially
with
the
time
extension.
that
was
in
november,
the
request
of
the
gao
was
march
of
1963
and
the
final
decision
of
the
commission
itself
was
may
1963.
following
the
decision
of
the
commissioner,
the
government
sought
request
for
review,
review
was
granted.
the
general
accounting
office
filed
an
amicus
brief
in
the
court
of
claims
and
of
course
the
court
of
claims
opinion
came
down
on
a
4:3
decisions
stating
that
as
of
no
material
difference
how
the
non-payment
came
about.
if
the
case
reached
the
court,
it
would
review
it
under
the
standards
of
the
wunderlich
act.
essentially,
the
standards
there
would
be
the
standards
of
supporting
by
substantial
evidence
that
the
plaintiff
involved
in
this
claims,
and
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
claims
remanded
the
case
to
its
commissioner
for
such
review.
the
dissent
saw
the
case
in
what
we
believe
to
be
the
broader
issues
and
the
important
issues
that
is,
that
is
necessary
for
the
courts
to
give
guidance
and
help
the
machinery
of
the
government
in
handling
disputes
processes
as
we
will
work
out.
it
pointed
out
that
the
atomic
energy
commission
with
the
representative
of
the
government
in
that
case,
that
it
sought
another
review.
the
general
accounting
office
was
not
a
party
and
not
authorized
to
act,
the
department
of
justices,
his
attorney,
was
not
authorized
to
act
in
the
matter
unless,
the
agency
delegated
with
a
responsibility
of
carrying
out
function
sought
its
intercession.
also,
it
was
very
strongly
stressed
that
this
will
have
a
chaotic
effect
on
the
operation
of
the
disputes
clause
which
is
so
essential
to
the
government
as
well
as
to
industry
in
doing
business
with
the
government,
and
that
people
were
entitled
to
certainty,
and
that
under
these
circumstances
with
doubt
existing,
and
with
the
right
existing
apparently
in
various
parties,
to
take
issue
with
the
termination
which
apparently
had
been
resolved
between
the
parties
themselves.
as
judge
collins
in
his
dissents
says
that
the
government
would
be
foolish
to
pay
any
award.
in
this
case,
we
seek
a
holding
that
there
was
a
breach
of
contract
and
the
failure
to
pay
this
award
and
asked
that
the
court
of
claims
be
reversed.
now,
here
the
government
seems
to
disclaim
the
general
accounting
office,
it
asserts
that
its
position
is
independent
of
that.
we
do
not
agree
with
that
in
any
way
whatsoever,
we
feel
as
of
the
gravamen
of
the
case.
the
government
also
claims
that
it
has
an
independent
right
to
set
up
these
defenses
in
a
proceeding
ignoring
what
gave
rise
to
the
proceeding
and
ignoring
altogether
the
impact
of
creating
this
vague,
undefined
procedure
which
gives
absolutely
no
guidance
to
contractors,
government
or
industry
other
than
to
throw
the
whole
procedure
which
has
been
established
over
a
long
period
of
time
into
a
state
of
uncertainty.
the
state
of
uncertainty,
which
will
impact
not
only
upon
contractor
but
upon
bankers,
sureties,
suppliers,
their
subcontractors,
and
others.
this
developed
a
vehicle
for
disputes
clause
has
proved
very
workable
and
very
advantageous
to
government
and
to
contractors
over
a
period
of
years.
it
provides
a
means
whereby
the
governments
work
can
go
forward,
it
can
change
and
improve
the
product
or
the
infrastructure
as
it
sees
fit.
permits
smaller
firms
to
bid,
because
they
finance
the
contract
of
government
fund,
they
pay
90%
as
they
go
along
and
note
that
in
the
changes
and
disputes
article,
the
contractor
must
proceed
right
there.
this
power
requiring
a
contractor
to
proceed
as
the
contract
is
interpreted
by
the
government
is
the
key
to
the
whole
thing
and
the
key
to
what
happened
here.
he
had
an
obligation
to
go
forward
and
do
this
work
even
though
his
work
was
doubled
and
even
though
he
was
barely
able
to
fund
it.
if
a
decision
is
subject
to
a
collateral
attack,
that
certainly
no
longer
exist
and
parties
will
no
longer
in
our
judgment
want
to
cover
government
work
or
if
they
do
so
they
will
set
up
large
contingencies
in
any
bid
they
make
and
it
will
disadvantage
everyone.
this
court
has
held
repeatedly
that
the
parties
have
the
right
to
contract
for
their
own
remedies.
the
uncertainty
that
arises
from
this
goes
to
the
fact
that
when
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
1951
and
to
and
the
moorman
and
the
wunderlich
cases
were
decided,
the
court
in
effect
announced
this
principle
and
invited
congress
to
change
the
standards
from
that
broad
being
the
sole
ground
of
review
as
established
by
those
decisions.
congress
did
and
passed
this
act
which
is
negative
in
nature,
not
jurisdictional.
it
does
not
give
powers
to
anyone,
it
merely
says
that
no
provision
of
a
contract
can
limit
the
judicial
review
to
cases
where
fraud
is
alleged
provided
that
the
decisions
of
the
heads
of
an
agency
will
be
final
unless
they
are
fraudulent
or
capricious
or
arbitrary
or
grossly
erroneous,
so
as
to
imply
bad
faith
or
is
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence,
and
that
no
contract
shall
have
a
provision
making
a
decision
of
an
official,
final,
and
plastered
into
the
wall.
the
interpretation
of
this
presents
a
very
perfecting
clause
so
acknowledged
by
anyone
who
has
had
to
deal
with
it.
in
the
initial
hearings,
when
it
was
proposed
that
an
act
fee
set
up,
that
there
was
provision
in
the
bill
then
proposed
that
a
comptroller
general
be
set
up
as
a
layer
of
review
along
with
courts
of
competent
jurisdiction.
objection
was
made
to
this
by
industry,
by
attorneys
and
by
officials
of
the
government
agencies
who
were
concerned
of
creating
another
layer
of
review
and
impacting
on
their
ability
to
implement
the
government’s
business.
that
provision
was
taken
out
of
the
bill
and
in
the
summation
of
the
report,
the
final
draft
of
the
bill
that
it
stated
very
clearly
that
there
was
no
intention
to
change
the
powers
of
the
general
accounting
office.
it
is
most
difficult
to
separate
the
position
of
the
government
and
the
general
accounting
office
and
we
say
they
are
inseparable.
we
say
it
was
invasive
that
the
general
accounting
officer
would
have
certain
powers
to
intercede
in
these
proceedings.
we
believe
it
was
intended
that
they
be
limited
to
the
powers
that
they
had
before
the
wunderlich
act
in
54,
was
not
adopted.
and
we
believe
that
those
powers
only
relate
to
protect
the
government
from
fraud
and
overreaching
or
with
respect
to
anything
which
would
be
of
an
auditing
nature.
in
other
words,
matters
having
to
do
with
physical
aspects
of
the
law
and
not
matters
having
to
with
the
substance
of
the
contract
itself.
on
that,
we
say
that
the
atomic
energy
commission
has
confidence
by
many
decisions
of
this
court
is
the
empowered
sole
authorized
agent
of
the
government
and
not
only
by
the
law,
the
atomic
energy
--
excuse
me?
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
that
is
correct.
now,
i
answer
that
this
way.
the
department
takes
the
position
in
this
brief,
in
this
court.
that
the
acquiescence
in
the
opinion
of
the
comptroller
general
of
december
66
constitutes
an
action,
we
would
say
otherwise.
we
say
that
practically
speaking,
being
told
by
your
banker
you
have
no
more
money
and
acting
accordingly,
plus
being
susceptible,
being
personally
back-charged
for
payments
so
made
does
not
create
an
independent
action.
further,
the
letter
which
is
exhibit
a
of
the
petition
on
page
10
of
the
appendix
clearly
indicates
that
the
commission
says,
it
will
take
no
action
inconsistent
with
the
ruling
of
the
comptroller
general.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
no
your
honor.
the
department
of
justice
represented
the
united
states
in
the
court
of
claims.
the
general
accounting
office
participated
in
the
court
of
claims.
two
more
points.
one,
there
is
no
need
for
the
general
accounting
office
to
be
involved
in
this
case.
the
government
is
completely
protecting
the
atomic
energy
commission
as
the
management,
technical,
legal,
staff.
in
this
instance
they
had
an
extended
set
of
review,
three
decisions
at
three
levels,
the
normal
case
that
is
sufficient.
they
will
undoubtedly,
under
these
circumstances,
that
the
governments
occasionally,
there
were
mistakes
made
in
favor
of
the
contractors,
mistakes
made
in
favor
of
the
government.
but
this
is
the
way
a
$50
billion
per
annum
business
has
to
work.
by
and
large
absence
and
propriety,
those
provisions
have
proved
the
advantage
of
everyone
and
should
be
permitted
to
stand.
if
i
may
address
it
in
this
context
your
honor.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
thank
you
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
just
question
one
or
two
things
that
the
assistant
to
the
attorney
general
had
said
and
make
final
comment.
with
respect
to
the
recitation
of
the
history
of
the
wunderlich
act
and
the
exchange
between
congressman
willis
and
franklin
schultz
is
where
we
have
on
page
8
of
our
reply
brief
continued
the
discussion
which
the
government
had
worked
to
point
it
out
there.
in
the
final
exchange,
mr.
willis
said
to
mr.
schultz,
this
judicial
review
referred
to
in
that
passage
there
referring
to
a
review
by
the
gao.
and
gao
has
been
left
deliberately
out
as
compared
to
s24
or
that
is
persuasive
sir.
in
other
words,
the
exchange
was
not
included
in
the
government’s
brief
or
in
the
government’s
comments
here.
with
respect
to
the
opinion
of
the
comptroller
general,
it
is
pointed
out
in
that
as
well
as
in
its
old
comments
which
are
in
the
appendix
to
the
government
brief
in
this
case,
that
s&e
contractors
had
no
valid
claim
against
the
government,
they
are
quoting
in
the
appendix
here
their
determination.
also,
as
i
have
stated
previously,
they
could
describe
that
action
as
an
advanced
disallowance
of
the
payment.
the
government
has
undertaken
to
state
that
we,
state
that
the
government
has
no
rights
in
situations
other
than
fraud.
our
position
is
not
advisable,
our
position
is
that,
the
government’s
rights
have
been
properly
protected
by
the
agency,
truly
qualify
personnel
and
legal
staffs
under
normal
circumstances
that
deal
with
the
routine
business.
and
that
the
certainty
and
finality
and
the
powers
of
that
agency
to
deal
with
commissions
and
responsibilities
assigned
to
it
demand
the
government
and
for
contractors
that
it
carry
out
those
powers
without
being
susceptible
to
collateral
attack
in
ordinary
circumstances.
no
one
has
ever
denied
and
indeed
the
justice
department
has
brought
out
in
the
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
in
1969
that
it
has
a
common
law
right
to
pursue
whatever
remedies
exist
for
payments
under
mistake
of
the
law
or
mistake
of
the
fact.
the
reference
to
the
langenfelder
case,
i
respectfully
disagree
with
two.
there
are
one
or
two
cases
cited
in
the
langenfelder
opinion
where
in
the
dictum,
judge
davis
did
make
some
comments
with
respect
to
the
powers
of
the
general
accounting
office.
however,
an
examination
of
those
cases
would
show
that
none
of
them
was
in
any
such
a
review
as
this
ever
conducted.
in
other
words,
a
comprehensive
review
of
a
complicated
interrelated
claim
essentially
involving
questions
under
the
contract.
one
of
the
cases
said
in
the
langenfelder
involved
a
back
charge
after
termination
and
other
required
the
right
to
recover
back
interest
from
the
contract
of
which
he
had
recovered
from
the
state
of
california
under
an
agreement
where
there
was
cost
plus
contract.
but
in
no
case,
was
there
a
comprehensive
and
factual
review
such
as
this.
and
in
fact,
in
the
decisions
of
the
court
of
claims,
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
that
issue
has
not
been
raised
with
respect
to
this
point.
we
raise
the
issue
not
because
we
are
here
to
tell
the
government
how
it
should
be
run,
we
would
rather
not,
we
would
rather,
you
collected
our
money
in
1961
or
2
or
at
least
in
1964
and
going
on
about
our
business.
instead,
we
lie
here
inert
while
other
agencies
assert
what
we
conceive
to
be
essentially
abstract
powers.
the
government
has
complete
control
of
the
government
contract,
the
regulations
and
indeed
congress,
overall
interpreted
by
this
court.
if
they
wanted
to
as
the
department
of
transportation
has
recently
done
and
set
up
the
precise
vehicle
for
a
review
of
instant,
board
of
contract
appeal’s
decision,
they
can
do
so.
but
in
doing
so,
i
think
it
will
destroy
the
efficacy
of
the
changes,
clause
and
the
disputes
procedure,
and
it
did
affect
and
detract
contractor’s
interest
in
participating
in
government
works.
i
seriously
question
whether
the
agency's
desire
the
result
of
which
the
court
of
claims,
majority
opinion
would
yield
in
this
case.
where
does
the
powers
stop?
this
court
has
said
clearly
and
unequivocally
in
the
mason
&
hanger
in
the
amnesty
cases
where
there
is
a
delegation
of
a
factor
like
function
to
represent
it
to
the
united
states
is
not
going
to
be
challenged
by
any
one
or
that
the
department
expressly
ruled
in
that
case.
this
un-presented
action
of
work
is
a
disaster
in
this
contract.
it
spent
ten
years
flat
on
its
back,
unable
to
proceed,
still
not
repaid
for
the
money
expanded.
i
ask
this
court
to
deal
with
the
whole
problem
to
restore
the
disputes
process
to
the
manner
in
which
it
has
judicially
worth
and
which
will
adhere
to
the
benefit,
contract,
as
government
and
the
like.
thank
you
very
much
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
also
here
for
re-argument,
and
it
comes
from
the
united
states
court
of
claims.
it
involves
the
finality
under
a
1961
federal
construction
contract
of
an
administrative
disputes
decision
favorable
to
the
contractor,
allowing
payment
for
certain
routine
contract
changes,
which
decision
was
accepted
by
the
contractor
and
by
the
agency,
the
atomic
energy
commission.
what
was
collaterally
attacked
by
the
comptroller
general
on
his
own
initiative
precluding
payment
and
forcing
us
to
suit
in
the
court
of
claims.
there
is
no
issue
as
to
the
authority
to
enter
the
contract,
obligate
funds
or
indeed
to
conduct
the
disputes
process.
neither
is
there
any
allegation
of
any
fraud,
wrongdoing
or
impropriety
whatsoever
on
the
part
of
anyone
connected
with
the
contractor
or
the
aec.
the
matter
is
simply
one
in
which
we
say
the
comptroller
general
in
an
overreaching
of
his
powers
has
blocked
payment
of
the
resolution
of
this
matter
under
the
disputes
process,
forcing
the
contractor
into
litigation.
the
department
of
justice
here,
takes
the
position
that
the
action
of
the
comptroller
general
is
immaterial
and
although
it
is
not
supported
by
the
atomic
energy
commission
in
it's
pursuit
of
this,
nevertheless
contends
that
this
creates
a
right
of
judicial
review
of
this
procedure.
the
case
was
decided
by
the
court
of
claims
in
a
4
to
3
opinion,
the
majority
holding
that
regardless
of
what
precipitated
the
litigation,
there
would
be
a
judicial
review
conducted
under
the
standards
of
the
wunderlich
act
of
1954.
and
the
case
was
remanded
to
the
commissioner
of
the
court
of
claims
for
hearing
on
the
merits.
therefore
the
case
is
not
here
on
the
merits
as
such,
but
on
the
question
of
the
finality
of
this
determination
under
the
disputes
process
and
the
rights
of
the
contract,
to
which
he
is
asserting
to
hold
that
disputes
process
having
been
accepted
by
the
agency
was
final.
and
it
is
not
subject
to
collateral
attack.
the
case
therefore
involves
a
contract
between
the
agencies
and
an
interpretation
of
this
wunderlich
act.
if
i
may
briefly
review
the
history
of
the
case
itself,
it
is
laid
out
as
a
chronology
on
page
one
of
the
appendix.
it
was
a
lump
sum
competitively
bid
federal
construction
contract
to
build
a
portion
of
the
atomic
reactive
test
station
for
the
navy
in
idaho.
the
original
sum
was
$1,272,000
and
the
contract
performance
period
was
180
days
or
to
run
from
august
1961
to
february
1962.
the
contract
was
entered
into
on
a
us
standard
form
23,
23a
and
so
forth,
well
with
the
contact
of
the
1953
edition
with
the
normal
and
usual
act,
with
adjustment
clauses
for
changes,
change
conditions
and
other
factors
in
the
contact.
it
worked,
however,
due
to
extra
work
and
extra
time,
actually
consumed
325
days
or
in
effect
approximately
double
the
time
of
performance
and
the
expenditures
involved.
six
claims
arose
out
of
this
and
amounting
to
$1,950,000
and
claims
for
an
additional
120
days
in
time
extensions.
they
are
routine
claims.
nothing
extraordinary
other
than
the
magnitude
of
them
in
relation
to
the
basic
contract
and
the
type
of
thing
that
is
encountered
in
almost
all
federal
construction
contacts.
denied
by
the
contracting
officer,
a
timely
appeal
taken,
they
were
referred
by
the
atomic
energy
commission
under
it's
then
existing
practice
to
an
examiner,
who
heard
in
a
13-day
hearing,
the
claims
in
an
adversary
proceeding
found
in
december
of
1962,
for
the
appellant
here
on
liability.
the
matter
was
remanded
by
him
to
the
contacting
officer
to
negotiate
quantum.
the
contacting
officer
appealed
to
the
commission
itself.
this
proceeding
to
this
extent
being
a
little
different
from
your
normal
board
of
contract
appeals
type
of
proceeding
which
is
prevalent
throughout
most
of
the
federal
departments
today.
the
full
commission
--
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
sir
today,
they
have
a
board
of
contract
appeals,
just
as
does
the
department
of
defense
does,
yes
sir.
on
november
1963,
the
full
commission
reaffirmed
some
of
the
claims
and
granted
a
review
by
the
full
commission
on
several,
mostly
pertaining
to
time
extensions.
in
may
14,
1963,
the
commission
itself
in
a
formal
act
affirmed
the
claims
other
than
a
slight
modification
on
one
regarding
time
of
site
access
which
it
remanded
for
negotiation,
and
directed
the
contract
--
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
by
the
atomic
energy
commission
board
of
contract
appeals
which
is
very
much
like
the
counter
part
of
the
armed
services
board
of
contract
appeals,
yes
sir,
your
honor.
there
was
this
remand
to
the
contracting
officer
again
in
may
of
1963
then
by
the
full
commission,
but
in
the
meanwhile
the
dispersing
officer
had
addressed
an
inquiry
to
the
general
accounting
office
regarding
certain
set
offs
involving
about
$32,000,
items
which
were
independent
of
the
merits
of
the
claims
themselves,
so
found
by
the
commissioner
of
court
of
claims
who
reported
on
this.
but
the
request
which
went
to
the
general
accounting
office
expressly
stated
that
it
was
not
to
be
construed
as
a
request
for
a
review
of
or
concurrence
in
the
decision.
nevertheless
the
general
accounting
office
did
contending
that
it
had
a
right
acting
in
an
executive
capacity
and
under
the
standard
of
the
wunderlich
act
to
review
the
entire
decision,
did
so
taking
33
months
to
do
it
and
in
a
260-page
opinion,
set
aside
the
entire
decision.
it
allowed
not
one
set,
it
allowed
not
one
day's
time
extension
and
in
it's
own
papers
filed
in
these
proceedings,
it
characterizes
this
action
as
an
advanced
notice
of
dis-allowance.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
perhaps
i
inadvertently
used
the
word
set
aside,
i
should
have
said,
they
simply
blocked
the
payment
of
this
taking
the
position
that
the
contractor
was
not
entitled
to
any
compensation
and
--
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
i
would
suppose
they
would
be
subjected
to
the
possible
charges
personally
or
their
bond
being
charged
by
the
comptroller
general,
with
the
amount
so
dispersed
if
his
position
had
--
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
sir,
the
amount
claimed
was
$1,950,000.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
well
there
was
never
an
agreed
settlement.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
the
examiner
found
liability,
the
commissioner
affirmed
liability
--
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
the
amount
had
not
been
resolved.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
it
was
in
negotiation,
the
amount
claimed
was
of
$1,950,000.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
correct
sir,
or
a
liability
under
bonds
or
the
dispersing
officer
might
have
run
that
risk.
that
is
not
altogether
[attempt
to
laughter]
clear
to
me
to
the
full
extent
of
that
--
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
it
would
be
as
we
view
it,
a
total
deterrent
to
making
a
dispersion.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
agreed,
quite
agreed,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
sir
the
petitioner
is
not
in
business.
he
has
been
unable
to
continue
in
business
ever
since
this.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
i
would
say
there
is
no
--
nothing
in
the
record
itself
to
this
effect,
bearing
in
mind
sir,
that
the
record
as
such
can
only
be
the
record
of
the
atomic
energy
commission
[attempt
to
laughter]
proceeding
as
reviewed
under
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
proceeding
in
the
court
of
claims.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
under
the
present
state
of
the
law,
no
sir.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
no
it
cannot.
there
have
been
some
decisions
in
recent
years
which
have
enabled
the
court
of
claims
to
recognize
that
in
an
overhead
expense
certain
interest
occurring
during
a
period
of
extended
overhead
while
that
work
was
being
performed,
but
there
is
no
basis
for
allowing
interest
for
the
period
beyond
the
time
when
the
contract
was
completed
which
was
of
course
in
1962.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
i'd
think
it
would.
there
is
a
remote
possibility
[attempt
to
laughter]
that
had
been
discussed
that
one
might
go
for
an
amendment
without
consideration
under
public
law
87653,
but
i
--
that
these
unprecedented
of
this,
simply
serving
as
run
through
i
think.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
correct.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
none
whatsoever,
sir.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
it
is
a
published
opinion
and
therefore
we
feel
free
to
refer
to
it
because
it's
in
the
opinions
of
the
comptroller
general.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
but
the
issue
in
this
suit,
once
we
have
brought
it
in
the
court
of
claims.
it
came
to
an
issue
on
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
yes.
but
it
should
be
noted
that
in
the
court
of
claims
not
only
the
department
of
justice,
but
an
attorney
from
the
general
accounting
office
appeared
with
the
government.
at
a
later
point
they
diverted
it
and
we
faced
with
more
than
one
adversary,
but
initially,
in
the
initial
motion,
it
was
a
filed
not
only
by
the
department,
but
by
the
--
joined
in
by
the
comptroller
general.
if
i
may
discuss
the
court
of
claims
proceeding
where
the
brief
--
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
they
have
reviewed
it
as
i
understand
it
on
the
basis
of
saying
that
it
was
a
review
as
to
whether
the
decision
of
the
aec
affirming
the
examiner's
decision
was
supported
by
substantial
evidence
and
whether
it
was
correct
as
a
matter
of
law
and
they
found,
it
was
not.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
negative.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
absolutely,
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
practically
speaking
that
is
correct,
yes
sir.
(inaudible)
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
i
think
the
dispersing
officer
would
have
been
within
his
own
rights
to
independently
refuse
to
make
that,
at
the
direction
--
either
of
his
superior.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
i
quite
agree.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
yes.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
historically
and
particularly
in
the
period
of
the
19th
century,
there
were
numerous
cases
and
some
in
this
century
where
the
attorney
general
took
entirely
different
view
of
the
rights
of
the
comptroller
general
and
specifically
held
that
in
matters
vested
in
the
discretion
of
the
administrative
official
that
he
had
no
right
to
superimpose
his
judgment.
and
one
of
the
big
issues
in
this
case
will
be
whether
that
was
altered
by
the
wunderlich
act.
in
other
words,
this
court
in
mason
&
hanger,
very
clearly
held
that
comptroller
general
had
no
right
to
adjudicate.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
yes.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
i
think
that
--
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
i
think
that's
correct,
but
our
point
here
is,
that
there
would
be
no
case
on
which
to
make
such
a
determination
were
not
for
the
improper,
unwarranted
and
illegal
act
of
the
comptroller
general.
in
fact
you
go
back
just
a
second
to
proceeding
in
the
court
of
claims,
i
think
it's
important
to
bring
out,
that
having
been
referred
to
the
commissioner
first,
he
made
a
recommendation
to
the
court,
that
the
court
find
that
this
was
a
breach
of
contract
and
that
it
render
summary
judgment.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
if
the
dispersing
officer
had
refused
to
pay
in
accordance
with
the
--
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
i
believe
not,
because
i
think
it
would
have
been
taken
away
from
him
by
the
action
of
the
commission
by
which
he
would
be
bound
since
there
is
a
formal
act
as
the
commission
and
the
hypothetical
situation
you
are
projecting
as
i
understand
it
would
entail
a
reversal
of
position
on
the
part
of
the
commission
itself
or
its
representative
--
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
if
such
a
situation
were
to
occur
then
i
would
suppose
in
due
course
if
we
were
unable
to
resolve
it,
we
would
have
the
possibilities
of
either
seeking
mandamus
action
which
has
been
done
in
some
cases,
where
it
involved
simply
a
ministerial
action
to
carry
out
an
obligation
of
the
united
states,
or
the
possibility
of
bringing
an
action
in
the
court
of
claims.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
in
either
event,
the
attorney
general
would
have
the
responsibility
defending
a
suit
against
the
united
states
--
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
well,
this
is
a
procedure
which
actually
the
attorney
general
suggested
in
that
opinion
of
january,
1969,
which
we
took
such
strong
issue.
in
other
words,
in
effect
he
suggested
that
anyone
within
the
government,
who
was
not
satisfied
had
the
right
to
short
circuit
it
[attempt
to
laughter],
if
you
will,
the
disputes
process
and
throw
the
thing
into
litigation
whereby
the
contractor
who
was
playing
by
the
government's
rules
accepted
this
onerous
contract
with
all
the
incumbent
responsibilities
of
caring
forth
changes,
that
is
expensive,
of
carrying
forward
at
his
expense
in
accordance
with
the
contracting
officer's
determination,
while
the
dispute
is
being
resolved
that
he
would
still
have
the
additional
onus,
having
one
of
carrying
on
this
litigation.
now
that
is
not
the
way
the
disputes
process
works.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
quite
--
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
absolute
case
of
insubordination
because
in
this
situation
by
statute
the
atomic
energy
commission
is
the
delegated
representative
of
the
government
and
in
this
situation
the
commission
itself
has
acted,
has
made
a
determination
and
that
determination
has
never
yet
been
altered.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
i
agree
with
that
theory.
now
in
fact
the
commissioner
white's
opinion
in
the
court
of
claims
held
that
this
non
payment
in
our
case
constituted
a
breach
of
contract
because
the
remedies
as
suggested
--
as
required
were
not
carried
out
were
unavailable.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
i
could
say
it
took
[attempt
to
laughter]
a
long
time
in
this
case
mr.
justice
douglas.
one
of
our
problems
in
this
case
of
course
is
that
s&e
contractors
are
taking
on
that
one
but
three
adversaries
really
in
a
sense,
although
we
have
no
conflict
with
the
atomic
energy
commission
at
this
point
in
time.
we
do
have
problems
on
the
one
hand
of
the
comptroller
general
and
on
the
other
hand
with
the
attorney
general.
as
i
started
to
say
a
little
bit
ago
in
the
initial
proceedings
in
the
court
of
claims,
they
were
together.
later
after
the
commissioner
found
for
s&e
and
after
we
filed
--
excuse
me,
the
government
jointly
filed
a
brief
seeking
review
and
we
responded,
they
split
and
took
different
positions
and
filed
a
amicus
brief
on
behalf
of
the
comptroller
general
asserting
different
positions
from
those
which
the
department
of
justice
had
asserted.
the
department
of
justice
seem
to
bottom
its
case
on
this
nebulous
right
of
making
independent
review
notwithstanding
the
circumstances
of
how
the
matter
came
about.
it
is
our
position
that
you
simply
cannot
arrive
at
such
a
situation
without
giving
recognition
to
and
approval
of
what
it
is
a
breach
of
contract
and
an
illegal
act,
the
failure
on
the
part
of
the
agency
of
united
states,
the
atomic
energy
commission
to
carry
out
it's
agreement
with
this
contractor.
and
from
time
immemorial,
this
court
has
recognized
the
rights
of
encouraged
parties
to
provide
methods
whereby
they
could
resolve
their
own
disputes.
in
the
case
of
the
government,
this
has
been
recognized
particularly
in
jone’s
case
120
years
ago
as
well
as
in
the
mason
&
hanger
case
to
which
i
adverted
to
a
little
while
ago
which
both
specifically
involved
an
attempt
by
the
comptroller
general
to
overrule
the
head
of
an
agency
on
a
routine
contract
matter
and
there
this
court
held
that
there
was
no
such
power.
now
was
this
authored
by
the
wunderlich
act;
remember
that
case,
excuse
me
that
act
came
about
as
a
result
of
two
decisions
of
this
court
in
1950
and
1951
whereby
this
court
in
upholding
the
rights
of
parties
to
contract
for
their
own
remedies
said
that
they
have
contracted
the
way
the
right
to
judicial
review.
in
the
moorman
case
involving
questions
of
law
and
in
the
wunderlich
case
involving
questions
of
fact,
the
court
suggested
that
the
congress
felt
a
different
standard
should
be
applied,
it
was
a
matter
for
congress
to
undertake.
congress
did
enact
this
wunderlich
act,
we
have
it
on
page
3
and
21
of
our
own
petition,
it's
short
--
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
we
have
cited
the
jone’s
case
in
1850,
yes.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
correct.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
yes.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
excuse
me.
what
exception?
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
yes,
it
actually
came
about
more
or
less
concurrently
because
in
wunderlich
decision,
you
had
said
--
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
i
regard
it
it
as
analogous
to
a
situation
in
the
private
contract
where
there
is
fraud
--
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
yes.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
it
has
been
characterized
as
a
tantamount
to
arbitration
by
some
although
we
see
it
does
not
keep
it
all
the
time.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
it
is
not
enforceable
if
you
please
mr.
justice
brennan
because
there
was
no
effort
to
enforce
it
on
the
part
of
the
official
and
the
government,
the
atomic
energy
commission.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
it
is
on
page
3
or
21
of
our
brief.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
none
your
honor.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
yes,
yes
it
runs
(voice
overlap)
i
am
sorry,
i
didn't.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
sir,
if
you
take
the
exact
wording
of
the
clause,
it's
plainly
intended
only
to
provide
for
the
contractor
because
it
says
the
decision
shall
be
final
and
conclusive
unless
the
contractor
may
also
or
otherwise
furnishes
a
contract
--
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
no,
it
is
not
sir.
i
am
just
saying,
the
government
cannot
attack
under
this
clause,
the
decision
of
the
contracting
officer
and
of
the
commissioner.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
no
fraud.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
yes
it
is.
but
this
clause
in
its
application
has
always
been
construed
as
only
for
writing
--
for
a
means
for
a
contractor
to
go
forward
with
these
appeals.
it
is
--
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
it
could
for
fraud.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
clause
which
is
in
question
here
of
course
was
not
the
one
(inaudible)
clause,
which
is
a
little
different.
this
is
the
clause
for
our
contract
and
we
are
--
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
yes
it
is
the
clause
under
our
contract
and
--
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
the
word
negotiated
[attempt
to
laughter]
has
broad
implications
--
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
it's
correct,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
conclude
by
saying
that
i
feel
that
this
case
is
one
in
which
the
broad
aspects
of
this
entire
problem,
the
application
of
the
disputes
process,
its
value
to
the
government
and
contracting
industry
should
be
given
very
serious
consideration.
that
the
power
to
control
the
incidence
of
contract
including
this
should
be
limited
to
those
of
the
using
agency,
that
it
determine
it
traditionally
although
the
construction
might
indicate
the
power
existed
by
the
government
to
process
this.
in
fact,
over
years
there
is
no
background
or
no
experience
of
it
having
been
done,
that
the
government
has
the
power
to
write
contracts
and
regulations
to
give
itself
powers
of
review
which
it
did
not
do
so
here.
and
that
it
would
be
a
last
time
done
to
this
contract
as
well
as
to
the
entire
contracting
industry,
if
this
case
is
not
overruled.
thank
you.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
yes
sir,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
as
i
reach
the
background
of
that
mr.
justice
blackmun,
the
intention
of
putting
that
reference
to
throw
in
there
and
is
brought
out
in
the
amicus
brief
of
the
american
bar
was
to
expressly
overcome,
restrict
standards
established
by
this
court
in
limiting
a
contractor's
right
over
due.
in
the
wunderlich
decision,
the
cases
where
fraud
was
alleged,
said
that
shall
not
be
limited
to
that
and
that
the
same
nevertheless
shall
be
presumed
final
unless
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence
as
well
as
not
fulfilling
the
other
four
standards
as
set
out
in
the
later
part
of
that
article.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
a
study
of
the
intent
history
of
the
wunderlich
act
will
disclose
that
the
comptroller
general
in
the
82nd
congress
having
sought
to
and
having
been
included
expressly
in
a
bill
as
a
tier
of
review
--
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
that
is
--
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
in
the
82nd
congress,
when
the
bill
was
under
consideration
that
he
would
be
included,
he
was.
strong
objection
--
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
oh!
yes.
(voice
overlap)
82nd
and
that's
the
one
i
don't
know
who
wrote.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
provision
for
the
comptroller
general
represented
a
compromise
proposed
by
him,
correct
mr.
justice
brennan.
due
to
objections
raised
by
the
department
of
the
defense
contractors
and
others
that
they
would
create
this
additional
tier
of
review
which
is
proved
so
awkward
in
this
situation.
mr.
geoffrey
creyke,
jr.
and
his
letter
which
i
have
in
the
house
report
1380,
says
and
in
effect,
it
is
intended
--
it
is
not
intended
to
be
the
change
the
jurisdiction
or
to
grant
any
new
jurisdiction
or
to
recognize
the
jurisdiction
which
he
has.
what
we
say
is
not
intended.
now
with
respect
to
the
overall
intent
of
the
act
one,
we
don't
believe
that
it
was
ever
intended
any
using
agency
would
attack
its
own
decisions
by
fraud.
with
respect
to
fraud,
otherwise
there
are
always
remedies
available
to
the
government
and
otherwise
but
the
procedure
as
it
has
been
afforded
here
to
just
take
away
from
the
disputes
process
it's
efficacy
is
simply
calamitous
within
the
operation
of
the
system
as
it
now
works.
when
a
contractor
signs
a
government
contract,
and
he
agrees
to
the
changes
clause
and
do
the
work
as
its
changed
and
he
agrees
to
the
disputes
clause,
he
says
he
will
keep
right,
i
am
going
to
his
expects
as
the
government
interprets
the
contract
and
which
he
did
here,
that
i
think
the
quid
pro
quo
involved
there
of
those
unlimited
powers
being
granted
to
the
government,
and
the
government
given
its
right
of
decision
itself.
