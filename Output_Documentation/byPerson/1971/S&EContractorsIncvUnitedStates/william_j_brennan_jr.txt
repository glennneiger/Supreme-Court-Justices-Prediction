justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
including
this
commission,
mr.
creyke?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
i
gather
that
today,
that
kind
of
action
would
be
taken
not
by
the
commission
itself
required
by
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
said
they
set
aside,
is
that
what
gao
did
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
suppose
despite
gao's
expressing
disapproval,
aec
had
gone
forward
nevertheless
and
paid
it,
now
what
would
have
been
the
risk
in
making
the
payment
that
the
members
of
the
commission
would
tell
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
amount
involved
was
about
a
million
dollars,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
mean
you
agreed
settlement
was
for
how
much?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh!
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
the
amount
had
not
been
fixed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
whatever
it
was
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
the
payment
had
been
made,
if
a
settlement
that
been
agreed
upon
and
the
payment
made,
the
million
dollars
whatever
the
amount
was,
then
the
members
of
the
commission
ran
the
risk
by
paying
it
of
the
personal
liability?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
expect
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
you
or
i
were
members
of
the
commission,
we'd
hesitate
twice,
were
that
sort
of
(inaudible)
making
the
payment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
creyke
in
the
--
then
you
had
to
bring
the
lawsuit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
in
that
lawsuit,
government
defended
of
course,
is
this
260-page
memorandum
of
any
binding
affect
on
anyone
in
the
lawsuit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
as
if
it
were
never
written?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
issue
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
those
cross
motions
have
to
be
decided
by
the
court
of
claims
independently
of
this
260-page
memorandum
or
anything
said
in
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
only
practically
speaking,
the
aec
could
have
gone
ahead
and
told
its
dispersing
officer
to
pay
it
anyway,
couldn’t
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
neither
was
going
to
risk
making
that
payment
for
fear
of
the
personal
liability,
if
they
did
in
the
face
of
the
disapproval
of
the
general
accounting
office,
wasn't
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
when
you
answered
mr.
justice
powell,
this
was
a
de
novo
review,
i
gathered
it's
not
a
review
of
any
kind,
whatever
that
260-page
memorandum
is,
it
has
no
legal
affect
except
there
is
a
statement
of
why
gao
disapproved,
wasn't
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
i
am
telling
mr.
creyke,
in
this
very
case,
the
problem
is
that,
the
attorney
general
had
said,
no
i
don't
agree
with
the
comptroller
general
and
i
am
not
going
to
send
this
to
him,
might
he
have
done
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
general
accounting
office
would
be
helpless
to
do
anything
about
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
judgment
would
have
gone
as
a
course
for
your
claim?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me,
mr.
creyke,
suppose
the
comptroller
general
had
not
taken
the
action
he
did,
but
the
dispersing
officer
for
whatever
reason,
he
just
refused
to
pay,
you'd
then
still
have
the
suit
wouldn't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
the
gao
did
nothing,
but
the
dispersing
officer
just
refused
to
pay,
you'd
still
have
to
sue,
wouldn't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
get
a
check
until
a
dispersing
officer
fills
it
out
and
send
it
to
you,
do
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
so
he
doesn't
fill
it
it
out
and
doesn't
send
it
to
you.
then
what's
your
position,
what
do
you
have
to
do?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
either
event,
the
attorney
general
would
defend
your
action,
i
take
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
the
attorney
general
were
then
to
say,
well
gao
might
have
thought
this
was
alright,
but
i
don't
and
i
am
going
to
defend
it
on
the
ground
on
which
the
gao
said
it
should
have
been
set
aside?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
creyke
apart
from
the
wunderlich
act,
i
guess
all
the
way
back
you
said
100
years
ago
or
so?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yeah,
and
kihlberg
and
rest
of
them
and
certainly
these
were
all
done,
this
was
a
contractual
matter,
wasn’t
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
they
--
how
the
parties
would
contract
as
i
recall
it
that
be
the
decision
to
an
official
or
one
of
them,
and
that
any
matter
in
dispute
would
be
resolved
by
him
and
that
his
decision
would
be
final
and
conclusive,
that's
as
much
as
the
closest
said
in
history,
isn't
that
right?
the
original
form
of
clause
was
a
very
short
thing,
that
wasn't
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
a
fraud
exception
was
engrafted
by
the
courts,
wasn’t
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
fraud
exception,
the
exception
for
fraud?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
no,
i
am
getting
back
to
1878
at
the
time
of
kihlberg.
at
that
time,
the
form
of
the
clause,
the
disputes
clause
was
simply
that
decision
of
an
official
of
one
of
the
contracting
parties
would
be
conclusive
and
binding
and
court
said
that
that
was
enforceable
in
the
absence
of
fraud,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
there
were
a
fraud,
then
even
the
party
who
is
official
had
been
agreed
upon
as
the
one
who
should
make
--
should
decide
the
dispute,
even
that
party
could
attack
the
award,
could
he
not,
for
frauds?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
whole
thing
grew
out
of
a
private
contract
provision,
didn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
railroad
construction
(inaudible).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
you
have
a
contract
in
which
you
have
a
provision
which
expands,
doesn't
it,
on
the
initial
form
of
the
disputes
clause,
from
the
simple
clause
and
includes
these
exceptions,
that's
--
it
maybe
set
aside
where
fraudulent
frauds
expressly
stated
and
then
four
of
the
exceptions.
now
just
as
a
matter
a
contract
law
and
to
the
old
line
of
cases
why
isn’t
got
enforceable,
just
as
the
initial
clause
was
always
enforceable
and
the
fraud
exception
of
course.
why
you'd
have
to
get
to
the
wunderlich
act
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
does
the
clause
read?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
page
5
i
guess,
isn’t
it?
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
there
is
and
it
goes
on
unless
it's
fraudulent
or
capricious
or
arbitrary
or
so
grossly
erroneous
as
necessary
to
imply
bad
faith
or
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence,
and
that's
the
one
that's
involved
here,
isn't
it,
page
6?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
quite
understand
why
--
and
the
only
thing
since
kihlberg
these
clauses
have
been
enforceable
with
a
suit
of
either,
why
that
isn’t
enforceable
is
to
all
those
grounds
from
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
mean
is
this
to
say
now
that
the
government
under
this
clause
cannot
attack
as
it
always
could
ever
since
kihlberg,
the
act
of
its
own
official
for
fraud?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
that
isn't
what
it
says.
it's
the
decision
of
the
commission
or
its
duly
authorized
representative
for
the
determination
of
such
appeals
which
i
take
it
would
be
the
contract
appeals
court
today,
shall
be
final
and
conclusive
unless
determined
by
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
to
have
been
fraudulent,
does
not
mean
the
government
could
attack
him
for
fraud?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alight,
or
capricious
or
arbitrary
or
so
grossly
erroneous
as
necessarily
to
imply
bad
faith,
or
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence,
which
is
the
ground,
isn’t
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suggest
not
where
fraud
was
involved.
it
was
always,
even
without
the
word
fraud
in
the
disputes
clause,
the
government
could
attack
the
word
its
own
official
for
fraud,
couldn’t
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright,
well
now
they
have
put
the
word
fraud
in
the
provision
itself
and
then
added
some
other
grounds
of
attack.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yeah,
this
is
a
clause
--
what
i
am
reading
from
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yeah,
what
you
like
i
gather
negotiate
it
with
the
government.
i
say
i
take
it
when
the
contract
was
entered
into
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
would
not
have
had
the
contract
if
you
hadn’t
agreed
to
a
contract
which
included
that
provision
i
take
it,
isn't
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
jaffe,
what's
the
risk
that
the
commission
ran
here
after
the
gao-260
page
memorandum?
had
they
paid,
had
they
gone
through
with
the
payment,
who
would
have
taken
what
risk?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
personally?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
the
practice
in
government
when
gao
indicates
disapproval
of
a
payment
about
to
be
made,
is
it
the
general
practice
to
make
it
or
sometimes
gao
defines
or
what
happens?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
there
is
as
was
here,
when
a
suit
is
brought,
what
could
the
attorney
general
do
about
the
lawsuit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
till
the
lawsuit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
you
could
have
confessed
judgments
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
tell
me
mr.
jaffe,
could
you
have
defended
simply
on
the
basis
of
the
provisions
or
the
clause
that
which
creyke
and
i
were
discussing
without
reference
to
the
wunderlich
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
who
wrote
the
wunderlich
act,
actually
wrote
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
is
an
argument
that
the
general
accounting
office
wrote
on
behalf
of
the
government
a
statute
which
would
limit
attack
down
these
contracts
only
to
attach
by
the
contract?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
seem
rather
peculiar
i
should
think
--
well
generally
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
general
accounting
office
would
be
acting
as
the
agent
of
the
contractor
against
such
legislation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
the
general
accounting
office
though
in
the
initial
draft
that
it
offered
as
the
substitute
for
the
mccarran
proposal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
mccarran
proposal
did
have
more
than
just
an
expanded
basis
of
judicial
review,
it
also
would
have
if
it
had
got
that
legislation
as
i
remember,
it
also
would
have
had
the
authority
itself
like
to
act
as
a
court
of
claim.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
the
gao
itself
would
do
that
when
it
got
to
the
house
and
then
--
in
the
succeeding
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
expanded
ground
of
the
judicial
review
remained
as
gao
initially
wrote
it
in
the
first
substitute
for
the
mccarran?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
the
issue
that
would
be
decided
in
the
court
of
claims
on
the
merits?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
issue
will
be
decided
on
the
merits
in
the
court
of
claims?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
standard
--
what
standards?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
that's
under
the
second
section?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
--
will
this
procedure
go
on
everyday
in
the
week?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
that
contract
itself?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
via
breach
of
contract,
i
guess?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
for
these
terms
of
the
contract?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
i
expect
mr.
jaffe,
this
maybe
a
very
cumbersome
and
difficult
and
in
terms
of
modern
business
quite
inefficient
way
of
doing
things.
that's
the
way
congress
has
ordered
--
that
you
suggest
to
the
way
government
should
be
carried
on
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
of
the
very
existence
of
the
gao.
if
comptroller
general
supposedly
--
the
congressional
(inaudible).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
unless
you
are
going
to
abolish
him
i
don't
see
how
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
be
he
ought
to
be
abolished
when
i
was
in
that
position,
i
used
to
think
so.[laughter]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
did
write
the
bill,
didn't
he,
mr.
creyke?
initially
mr.
mccarran
introduced
the
bill.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
would
substitute
for
that
bill,
well,
i
am
sure
i
have
read
the
same
history
available
to
you
and
the
comptroller
general
--
and
it
was
substituted
for
mccarran
bill,
the
bill
of
the
comptroller
general.
bill
of
the
comptroller
general
--
i
don't
know
your
honor
who
wrote
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
course,
you
find
in
the
history
so
it
says.
well,
i
don't
know
who
wrote
the
first
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
he
wrote
the
very
bill
that
included
him,
the
comptroller
general
wrote
the
very
bill
that
included
him?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
don't
either,
i
think
you
(inaudible).
but
the
bill,
it
became
law
is
the
one
that
the
comptroller
general
wrote
with
one
minor
exception
and
the
deletion
of
the
provision
which
gave
him
with
the
courts
the
power
of
independent
review.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
didn't
they
actually
referred
it,
would
make
the
gao
as
second
court
of
claims
as
a
worthy
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
including
this
commission,
mr.
creyke?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
i
gather
that
today,
that
kind
of
action
would
be
taken
not
by
the
commission
itself
required
by
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
said
they
set
aside,
is
that
what
gao
did
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
suppose
despite
gao's
expressing
disapproval,
aec
had
gone
forward
nevertheless
and
paid
it,
now
what
would
have
been
the
risk
in
making
the
payment
that
the
members
of
the
commission
would
tell
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
amount
involved
was
about
a
million
dollars,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
mean
you
agreed
settlement
was
for
how
much?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh!
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
the
amount
had
not
been
fixed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
whatever
it
was
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
the
payment
had
been
made,
if
a
settlement
that
been
agreed
upon
and
the
payment
made,
the
million
dollars
whatever
the
amount
was,
then
the
members
of
the
commission
ran
the
risk
by
paying
it
of
the
personal
liability?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
expect
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
you
or
i
were
members
of
the
commission,
we'd
hesitate
twice,
were
that
sort
of
(inaudible)
making
the
payment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
creyke
in
the
--
then
you
had
to
bring
the
lawsuit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
in
that
lawsuit,
government
defended
of
course,
is
this
260-page
memorandum
of
any
binding
affect
on
anyone
in
the
lawsuit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
as
if
it
were
never
written?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
issue
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
those
cross
motions
have
to
be
decided
by
the
court
of
claims
independently
of
this
260-page
memorandum
or
anything
said
in
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
only
practically
speaking,
the
aec
could
have
gone
ahead
and
told
its
dispersing
officer
to
pay
it
anyway,
couldn’t
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
neither
was
going
to
risk
making
that
payment
for
fear
of
the
personal
liability,
if
they
did
in
the
face
of
the
disapproval
of
the
general
accounting
office,
wasn't
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
when
you
answered
mr.
justice
powell,
this
was
a
de
novo
review,
i
gathered
it's
not
a
review
of
any
kind,
whatever
that
260-page
memorandum
is,
it
has
no
legal
affect
except
there
is
a
statement
of
why
gao
disapproved,
wasn't
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
i
am
telling
mr.
creyke,
in
this
very
case,
the
problem
is
that,
the
attorney
general
had
said,
no
i
don't
agree
with
the
comptroller
general
and
i
am
not
going
to
send
this
to
him,
might
he
have
done
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
general
accounting
office
would
be
helpless
to
do
anything
about
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
judgment
would
have
gone
as
a
course
for
your
claim?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me,
mr.
creyke,
suppose
the
comptroller
general
had
not
taken
the
action
he
did,
but
the
dispersing
officer
for
whatever
reason,
he
just
refused
to
pay,
you'd
then
still
have
the
suit
wouldn't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
the
gao
did
nothing,
but
the
dispersing
officer
just
refused
to
pay,
you'd
still
have
to
sue,
wouldn't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
get
a
check
until
a
dispersing
officer
fills
it
out
and
send
it
to
you,
do
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
so
he
doesn't
fill
it
it
out
and
doesn't
send
it
to
you.
then
what's
your
position,
what
do
you
have
to
do?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
either
event,
the
attorney
general
would
defend
your
action,
i
take
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
the
attorney
general
were
then
to
say,
well
gao
might
have
thought
this
was
alright,
but
i
don't
and
i
am
going
to
defend
it
on
the
ground
on
which
the
gao
said
it
should
have
been
set
aside?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
creyke
apart
from
the
wunderlich
act,
i
guess
all
the
way
back
you
said
100
years
ago
or
so?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yeah,
and
kihlberg
and
rest
of
them
and
certainly
these
were
all
done,
this
was
a
contractual
matter,
wasn’t
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
they
--
how
the
parties
would
contract
as
i
recall
it
that
be
the
decision
to
an
official
or
one
of
them,
and
that
any
matter
in
dispute
would
be
resolved
by
him
and
that
his
decision
would
be
final
and
conclusive,
that's
as
much
as
the
closest
said
in
history,
isn't
that
right?
the
original
form
of
clause
was
a
very
short
thing,
that
wasn't
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
a
fraud
exception
was
engrafted
by
the
courts,
wasn’t
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
fraud
exception,
the
exception
for
fraud?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
no,
i
am
getting
back
to
1878
at
the
time
of
kihlberg.
at
that
time,
the
form
of
the
clause,
the
disputes
clause
was
simply
that
decision
of
an
official
of
one
of
the
contracting
parties
would
be
conclusive
and
binding
and
court
said
that
that
was
enforceable
in
the
absence
of
fraud,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
there
were
a
fraud,
then
even
the
party
who
is
official
had
been
agreed
upon
as
the
one
who
should
make
--
should
decide
the
dispute,
even
that
party
could
attack
the
award,
could
he
not,
for
frauds?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
whole
thing
grew
out
of
a
private
contract
provision,
didn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
railroad
construction
(inaudible).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
you
have
a
contract
in
which
you
have
a
provision
which
expands,
doesn't
it,
on
the
initial
form
of
the
disputes
clause,
from
the
simple
clause
and
includes
these
exceptions,
that's
--
it
maybe
set
aside
where
fraudulent
frauds
expressly
stated
and
then
four
of
the
exceptions.
now
just
as
a
matter
a
contract
law
and
to
the
old
line
of
cases
why
isn’t
got
enforceable,
just
as
the
initial
clause
was
always
enforceable
and
the
fraud
exception
of
course.
why
you'd
have
to
get
to
the
wunderlich
act
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
does
the
clause
read?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
page
5
i
guess,
isn’t
it?
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
there
is
and
it
goes
on
unless
it's
fraudulent
or
capricious
or
arbitrary
or
so
grossly
erroneous
as
necessary
to
imply
bad
faith
or
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence,
and
that's
the
one
that's
involved
here,
isn't
it,
page
6?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
quite
understand
why
--
and
the
only
thing
since
kihlberg
these
clauses
have
been
enforceable
with
a
suit
of
either,
why
that
isn’t
enforceable
is
to
all
those
grounds
from
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
mean
is
this
to
say
now
that
the
government
under
this
clause
cannot
attack
as
it
always
could
ever
since
kihlberg,
the
act
of
its
own
official
for
fraud?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
that
isn't
what
it
says.
it's
the
decision
of
the
commission
or
its
duly
authorized
representative
for
the
determination
of
such
appeals
which
i
take
it
would
be
the
contract
appeals
court
today,
shall
be
final
and
conclusive
unless
determined
by
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
to
have
been
fraudulent,
does
not
mean
the
government
could
attack
him
for
fraud?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alight,
or
capricious
or
arbitrary
or
so
grossly
erroneous
as
necessarily
to
imply
bad
faith,
or
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence,
which
is
the
ground,
isn’t
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suggest
not
where
fraud
was
involved.
it
was
always,
even
without
the
word
fraud
in
the
disputes
clause,
the
government
could
attack
the
word
its
own
official
for
fraud,
couldn’t
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright,
well
now
they
have
put
the
word
fraud
in
the
provision
itself
and
then
added
some
other
grounds
of
attack.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yeah,
this
is
a
clause
--
what
i
am
reading
from
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yeah,
what
you
like
i
gather
negotiate
it
with
the
government.
i
say
i
take
it
when
the
contract
was
entered
into
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
would
not
have
had
the
contract
if
you
hadn’t
agreed
to
a
contract
which
included
that
provision
i
take
it,
isn't
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
jaffe,
what's
the
risk
that
the
commission
ran
here
after
the
gao-260
page
memorandum?
had
they
paid,
had
they
gone
through
with
the
payment,
who
would
have
taken
what
risk?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
personally?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
the
practice
in
government
when
gao
indicates
disapproval
of
a
payment
about
to
be
made,
is
it
the
general
practice
to
make
it
or
sometimes
gao
defines
or
what
happens?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
there
is
as
was
here,
when
a
suit
is
brought,
what
could
the
attorney
general
do
about
the
lawsuit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
till
the
lawsuit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
you
could
have
confessed
judgments
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
tell
me
mr.
jaffe,
could
you
have
defended
simply
on
the
basis
of
the
provisions
or
the
clause
that
which
creyke
and
i
were
discussing
without
reference
to
the
wunderlich
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
who
wrote
the
wunderlich
act,
actually
wrote
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
is
an
argument
that
the
general
accounting
office
wrote
on
behalf
of
the
government
a
statute
which
would
limit
attack
down
these
contracts
only
to
attach
by
the
contract?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
seem
rather
peculiar
i
should
think
--
well
generally
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
general
accounting
office
would
be
acting
as
the
agent
of
the
contractor
against
such
legislation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
the
general
accounting
office
though
in
the
initial
draft
that
it
offered
as
the
substitute
for
the
mccarran
proposal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
mccarran
proposal
did
have
more
than
just
an
expanded
basis
of
judicial
review,
it
also
would
have
if
it
had
got
that
legislation
as
i
remember,
it
also
would
have
had
the
authority
itself
like
to
act
as
a
court
of
claim.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
the
gao
itself
would
do
that
when
it
got
to
the
house
and
then
--
in
the
succeeding
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
expanded
ground
of
the
judicial
review
remained
as
gao
initially
wrote
it
in
the
first
substitute
for
the
mccarran?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
the
issue
that
would
be
decided
in
the
court
of
claims
on
the
merits?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
issue
will
be
decided
on
the
merits
in
the
court
of
claims?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
standard
--
what
standards?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
that's
under
the
second
section?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
--
will
this
procedure
go
on
everyday
in
the
week?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
that
contract
itself?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
via
breach
of
contract,
i
guess?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
for
these
terms
of
the
contract?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
i
expect
mr.
jaffe,
this
maybe
a
very
cumbersome
and
difficult
and
in
terms
of
modern
business
quite
inefficient
way
of
doing
things.
that's
the
way
congress
has
ordered
--
that
you
suggest
to
the
way
government
should
be
carried
on
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
of
the
very
existence
of
the
gao.
if
comptroller
general
supposedly
--
the
congressional
(inaudible).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
unless
you
are
going
to
abolish
him
i
don't
see
how
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
be
he
ought
to
be
abolished
when
i
was
in
that
position,
i
used
to
think
so.[laughter]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
did
write
the
bill,
didn't
he,
mr.
creyke?
initially
mr.
mccarran
introduced
the
bill.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
would
substitute
for
that
bill,
well,
i
am
sure
i
have
read
the
same
history
available
to
you
and
the
comptroller
general
--
and
it
was
substituted
for
mccarran
bill,
the
bill
of
the
comptroller
general.
bill
of
the
comptroller
general
--
i
don't
know
your
honor
who
wrote
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
course,
you
find
in
the
history
so
it
says.
well,
i
don't
know
who
wrote
the
first
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
he
wrote
the
very
bill
that
included
him,
the
comptroller
general
wrote
the
very
bill
that
included
him?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
don't
either,
i
think
you
(inaudible).
but
the
bill,
it
became
law
is
the
one
that
the
comptroller
general
wrote
with
one
minor
exception
and
the
deletion
of
the
provision
which
gave
him
with
the
courts
the
power
of
independent
review.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
didn't
they
actually
referred
it,
would
make
the
gao
as
second
court
of
claims
as
a
worthy
--
