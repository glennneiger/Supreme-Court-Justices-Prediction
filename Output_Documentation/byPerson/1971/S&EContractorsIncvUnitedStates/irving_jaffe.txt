mr.
irving
jaffe
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
simply
this,
whether
in
a
disputes
clause
decision,
the
government
has
the
right
in
a
court
to
challenge
a
decision
favorable
to
the
contractor.
in
this
particular
case,
the
decision
of
the
atomic
energy
commission
or
that
of
its
hearing
examiners
which
was
not
disturbed
is
still
the
only
decision
that
was
handed
down.
it
is
the
only
decision
that
is
before
the
court
of
claims,
it
is
the
only
decision
that
the
pleadings
placed
before
the
court
of
claims
and
to
which
the
answer
and
petition
were
addressed.
the
general
accounting
office
did
not
change
that
decision.
the
department
of
justice
did
not
change
that
decision.
there
has
been
no
review
in
the
sense
that
the
petitioner
alleges
which
has
altered
or
in
anyway
interfered
with
the
atomic
energy’s
commission
except
to
subject
that
the
decision
itself
was
not
final
and
not
being
final,
that
payment
could
not
be
made
there
under.
now,
the
atomic
energy
commission
may
disagree
with
that.
it
may
feel
that
the
decision
which
is
handed
down
is
sound.
even
so,
it
seems
to
me
it
is
the
height
of
prudence.
if
the
suggestion
is
made
to
it
by
gao,
by
its
own
general
counsel,
by
any
respected
attorney
that
if
there
is
doubt
cast
on
whether
or
not
the
criteria
for
finality
as
enunciated
in
the
wunderlich
act
have
not
been
met,
then
payment
should
not
be
made
as
one
way
in
which
judicial
review
can
be
compelled,
so
that
the
standards
of
finality
may
be
applied
to
that
decision.
furthermore,
it
might
very
well
be
suggested
and
if
it
is
not
so,
that
payment
would
have
been
improper
under
those
circumstances,
because
payment
is
only
required
in
connection
with
a
final
decision
of
an
agency
or
a
board
of
contract
appeal.
now,
the
general
accounting
office
did
nothing
more
than
review
this.
they
reviewed
it
in
response
to
a
request
from
a
certifying
officer.
that
certifying
officer
was
acting
under
a
statute
which
gave
it
--
give
him
the
permission
and
the
authority
to
seek
an
advanced
opinion
as
to
what
the
accounting
treatment
would
be
in
the
event
a
payment
which
he
was
asked
to
make
be
made.
the
general
accounting
office
in
considering
that,
that
request
was
discharging
a
statutory
duty.
in
discharging
that
statutory
duty,
it
was
required
to
determine
whether
or
not
and
if
this
payment
were
made
and
it
was
making
a
post
audit,
would
it
accept
to
it,
would
it
disallow
it.
and
in
making
that
determination,
it
must
apply
of
course
the
applicable
principles
of
law.
in
a
disputes
situation,
the
only
applicable
principles
of
law
are
the
standards
provided
by
the
wunderlich
act.
the
wunderlich
act
says
that
a
payment
that
is
a
decision
will
be
final,
if
it
is
not
fraudulent,
if
it
is
not
arbitrary
or
capricious,
is
supported
by
substantial
evidence,
or
is
not
so
clearly
erroneous
or
not
so
grossly
erroneous
as
to
imply
bad
faith.
now,
those
are
the
principles
which
he
must
apply.
and
in
applying
those,
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
if
he
were
to
review
this,
he
does
not
think
that
the
decision
met
those
standards,
therefore,
he
would
be
compelled
to
disallow
it.
and
he
so
advised,
it
was
only
advice
to
the
commission.
what
he
told
the
commission
was,
that
if
you
make
this
payment,
i
will
be
compelled
to
disallow
it.
he
did
not
say
you
cannot
make
it.
he
could
not
say
you
cannot
make
it
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
yes,
it
is
a
deterrent,
but
it
is
a
not
a
legal
deterrent.
it
is
a
deterrent
in
that
no
one
wants
to
risk
having
a
payment
disallowed.
but
how
bad
a
deterrent
is
that
mr.
chief
justice,
if
you
know
that
the
matter
can
be
submitted
to
a
court,
is
submission
of
an
issue
to
a
court
for
final
determination.
such
a
great
risk
or
is
it
such
a
great
burden
that
everyone
should
shy
clear
of
it?
all
that
it
does
and
all
that
the
general
accounting
officer
can
do
is
take
an
action
that
will
precipitate
judicial
review.
would
it
have
made
any
difference
if
the
payments
had
been
made?
and
then
the
department
of
justice
at
the
request,
either
of
gao
or
of
the
agency,
had
sued
for
a
three
turn
on
the
ground
that
it
was
an
illegal
payment,
because
it
was
not
paid
in
pursuance
of
a
final
decision.
the
judicial
review
would
have
occurred
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
irving
jaffe
in
the
district
court,
because
in
the
court
of
claims,
the
defendant
is
always
the
united
states
and
not
the
plaintiff.
now,
the
petitioner
has
alleged
that
the
gravamen
of
this
suit
is
the
intervention
and
inter-possession
of
the
comptroller
general.
it
is
the
contention
of
the
government
that
the
role
of
the
general
accounting
office
played
in
this
case
is
wholly
irrelevant
to
the
issue,
the
issue
being
whether
or
not,
a
favorable
decision
to
a
contract
that
maybe
challenged
by
the
government
in
court.
now,
the
action
of
the
general
accounting
office
is
in
our
opinion
irrelevant
because
it
did
not
precipitate
the
suit.
and
even
if
it
did,
it
does
not
make
any
difference
because
that
only
gives
rise
at
that
point,
whether
or
not,
we
can
challenge
it.
but
i
do
not
believe
that
it
precipitated
the
suit
any
more
than
the
certifying
officer
precipitated
the
suit
in
addressing
an
inquiry
to
it.
what
did
precipitate
the
suit
by
the
petitioner
instead
of
by
the
government
was
the
failure
of
the
atomic
energy
commission
to
make
payment.
now,
the
legislative
history
which
the
petitioner’s
brief
devotes
a
good
deal
of
space
too
is,
in
our
opinion,
significant
only
and
that,
it
shows
that
congress
did
intend
or
access
to
the
courts
to
test
the
finality
criteria
of
that
act
to
be
available
to
both
parties
and
not
to
one.
the
petitioner,
it
seems
to
me,
goes
far
afield
when
he
addresses
his
remarks
to
the
role
of
the
gao
was
at
one
time
intended
to
play
in
this
situation.
some
of
the
statutes,
not
the
initial
one,
shortly
thereafter,
included
the
general
accounting
office
as
a
level
of
review
equal
to
that
of
the
courts.
at
that
point,
there
was
much
opposition
to
the
inclusion
of
the
general
accounting
office.
the
opposition
came
from
industry
and
from
the
government
and
from
the
private
party.
but
this
review
is
not
the
review
that
was
ever
granted.
that
review
was
the
right
to
change
that
opinion,
to
modify
it,
reverse
it,
to
make
a
binding
determination
on
both
contractual
parties
just
as
would
a
court.
now,
that
was
eliminated.
it
no
longer
has
that,
it
did
not
do
it
now.
this
review
did
not
change
any
part
of
the
decision,
that
being
so,
the
legislative
history
is
only
helpful
for
the
other
aspects
for
which
it
is
mentioned
by
both
parties
and
that
is,
whether
or
not,
the
congress
intended
that
judicial
review
would
be
available
to
both
parties,
the
government
and
the
contractor.
and
in
that
connection,
there
were
proposals
submitted
to
the
congress
expressly
to
limit
judicial
review
or
access
to
the
courts
to
seek
judicial
review
to
the
contractor
alone.
the
congress
did
not
adopt
any
of
those
proposals.
one
of
those
proposals
was
made
by
the
american
bar
association.
their
proposal
confined
judicial
review
to
one
requested
by
the
contractors.
this
was
not
merely
something
that
submitted
to
the
congress
which
may
have
been
overlooked,
because
one
of
the
leading
witnesses
before
the
committees,
mr.
franklin
m.
schultz,
addressed
himself
specifically
to
that
problem.
he
pointed
out
that
the
bill
as
proposed
and
as
enacted
would
on
its
face
appear
to
make
judicial
review
available
to
both
parties.
and
when
congress
has
been
tied,
asked
them
what
was
pointed
out,
that
was
precisely
what
it
would
do
is
to
show
that
is
what
disturbs
me.
precisely
what
disturbs
him
and
then
proposed
that
the
ada
proposal
which
confided
only
to
the
contractor
be
adopted.
and
that
was
not
adopted.
the
congressional
committee
at
least
that
was
considering
it
was
well
aware
of
the
request
by
some
few
people
that
it
be
limited
to
the
contractor.
not
only
that,
mr.
creyke
says
that
at
no
time
did
anyone
assume,
that
anyone,
but
the
general
accounting
office
would
be
an
avenue
for
review
on
behalf
of
the
government.
the
congressional
history
shows
that
mr.
congressman
willis
was
asked
specifically
the
question,
who
on
the
part
of
the
government
would
ask
for
the
judicial
review
and
his
response
was
the
department
of
justice,
the
department
of
defense
as
well
as
the
general
accounting
office.
there
was
nothing
here
that
went
by
unnoticed.
and
the
testimony,
even
the
report,
indicates
very
clearly
that
the
lack
of
judicial
review
in
essence
of
--
as
a
result
of
this
court’s
decisions
in
the
moorman
and
wunderlich
cases,
that
the
lack
of
judicial
review,
meaningful
judicial
review
to
either
of
the
party
worked
as
much
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
government
as
it
did
to
the
contractor.
and
that
both
parties
should
have
a
day
in
court
and
have
access
to
the
court
for
review
in
accordance
with
standards
which
the
congress
believed
would
be
more
meaningful.
and
that
is
precisely
what
the
wunderlich
act
did.
mr.
irving
jaffe
at
the
department
of
justice.
mr.
irving
jaffe
yes,
if
you
use
the
word
review
and
the
sense
of
making
the
mitigative
determinations
which
is
the
responsibility
imposed
upon
it
by
statute.
in
that
sense,
yes,
it
reviews
every
litigation
request
that
comes
before
it.
we
do
not
institute
suit
at
every
request
of
the
agencies
nor
do
we
defend
every
suit
in
which
an
agency
is
sued.
indeed,
in
a
situation
identical
to
this
one.
not
too
long
ago
where
an
agency
did
refuse
to
make
payment
in
accordance
with
a
board
of
contract
appeals
decision,
and
the
contractor
sued
in
the
court
of
claims.
we
did
not
answer
that
case
because
our
review
preparatory
to
filing
an
answer
convinced
us
that
the
decision
of
the
board
was
supported
by
a
substantial
evidence,
did
meet
the
criteria
of
the
wunderlich
act
and
when
the
agency
continue
to
refuse
to
pay,
we
consented
to
the
entry
of
judgment.
mr.
irving
jaffe
pardon.
mr.
irving
jaffe
well,
i
think
i
would
have
to
say
mr.
chief
justice
that
is
an
infrequent
occurrence.
that
is
the
only
instance
of
which
i
know.
i
think
it
is
significant
too,
especially
since
the
petitioner
has
painted
a
black
picture
of
what
happens
if
you
affirm
the
court
of
claims’
decision
in
the
contracting
field,
that
since
at
least,
the
time
when
the
court
of
claims
decided
the
langenfelder
case
in
1965
and
it
set
forth
their
view
that
the
department
of
--
the
government
rather
had
a
right
to
judicial
review
under
the
wunderlich
act
and
to
challenge
a
board
decision.
we
have
not
had
any
flood
of
litigation
in
which
that
has
occurred
nor
even
more
significantly
for
the
past
two-and-half
or
more
years
since
the
attorney
general
had
issued
his
opinion
of
january
1969,
in
which
he
encouraged
the
agencies
to
review
themselves,
the
decisions
of
the
board,
and
if
they
thought
that
one
of
those
decisions
did
not
meet
the
criteria,
to
sent
it
to
the
department
of
justice
for
an
advance
opinion.
we
have
had
very,
very
few
and
as
far
as
i
know,
none
in
which
we
recommended
that
the
decision
be
challenged.
so
i
do
not
anticipate
the
flood
at
all.
mr.
irving
jaffe
yes
sir.
mr.
irving
jaffe
well,
it
is.
i
am
not
certain
mr.
justice
blackmun
that
i
can
give
you
an
adequate
answer.
i
do
not
know
why
it
has
arisen
in
this
form
or
in
any
form
at
this
time
because
i
had
always
been
of
the
impression
that
it
was
a
generally
conceded
right
for
the
government
to
challenge
a
board
decision
that
was
favorable
to
the
contractor.
indeed,
in
the
langenfelder
case,
the
court
then,
judge
davis,
in
a
footnote
or
perhaps
in
the
body
lists,
many
cases
in
which
precisely
that
was
done
since
at
least
the
wunderlich
act.
it
is
very
difficult
to
go
earlier
than
the
wunderlich
act,
because
there
was
very
little
to
review,
on
kind
of
work
both
ways,
neither
the
government
nor
the
contractor
could
upset
a
decision
except
in
case
of
fraud
or
over
reaching.
mr.
irving
jaffe
1954
it
was
enacted.
mr.
irving
jaffe
yes,
yes
it
is.
now,
i
would
like
to
touch
briefly
on
the
role
of
the
department
of
justice
in
all
litigation.
i
have
alluded
to
it
already.
but
as
this
court
knows
the
relationship
between
the
department
of
justice
and
its
client
agencies,
if
i
may
refer
thast
way
to
the
various
department
and
agencies
of
the
government
is
not
the
same
as
the
ordinary
attorney
client.
because
by
statute,
the
department
of
justice
must
make
a
judgment
with
respect
to
whether
litigation
shall
be
pursued
or
instituted
or
whether
or
not,
it
shall
be
defended.
that
requires
it
to
make
a
judgment
on
the
merits
of
the
case.
his
client
cannot
discharge
him.
his
client,
if
you
will,
is
stuck
with
the
department
of
justice.
now,
the
department
of
justice
under
those
circumstances
is
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
a
much
more
serious
review
of
what
is
presented
by
any
litigation
or
what
if,
that
is
either
defensive
or
prosecuted
and
that
decision
is
an
important
one.
therefore,
and
in
this
case,
i
wish
to
point
out
the
department
of
justice
was
not
involved
at
any
stage
in
the
dispute
process
prior
to
the
decision
of
the
atomic
energy
commission.
it
was
not
involved
in
this
case
after
the
decision
of
the
atomic
energy
commission
and
did
not
get
involved
until
we
received
a
copy
of
the
petition
that
had
been
filed
in
the
court
of
claims
by
this
plaintiffs.
at
that
point,
we
did
what
we
are
required
to
do.
we
examined
it,
we
examined
the
petition,
we
looked
at
the
record
before
the
atomic
energy
commission.
we
determined
as
we
had
to,
whether
or
not,
there
were
any
wunderlich
act
defenses
that
could
be
interposed
to
this.
we
came
to
the
conclusion
that
there
were.
in
fact,
we
came
to
the
conclusion
that
there
was
such
a
defense
that
ought
to
be
interposed
with
respect
to
each
and
every
claim
that
was
asserted
in
the
petition,
say
one.
well,
i
am
not
even
sure
of
that.
we
paid
one
but
i
think
we
found
something
objectionable
to
that
too.
now,
that
is
doing
only
what
the
law
requires
us
to
do.
we
must
do
that
for
the
petitioner
to
subject
that
we
had
only
one
function
to
perform,
and
that
is
to
inquire
whether
there
have
been
fraud
or
over
reaching.
and
otherwise,
to
consent
to
the
entry
of
judgment
even
if
it
was
clear
that
there
was
no
evidence
to
support
the
decision.
or
that,
it
was
clearly
erroneous
as
a
matter
of
law
or
that
section
322
came
into
play
of
the
wunderlich
act,
that
is
a
question
of
law,
was
decided
wrongfully,
or
should
we
submit
it
to
the
court.
we
did
not
reverse
the
decision,
we
did
decide
that
the
court
ought
to
pass
on
it,
and
that
is
what
our
answer
does,
confined
to
the
record
before
the
atomic
energy
commission.
no
one
placed
before
the
court
of
claims,
the
lengthy
opinion
of
the
general
accounting
office.
no
one
submitted
to
the
court
of
claims,
saving
our
answer.
any
of
the
analysis
of
the
department
of
justice
has
though
or
an
opinion
or
a
review
which
have
any,
any
effect
on
this
decision
or
changed
it
in
any
way.
that
is
the
role
of
the
department
of
justice.
it
is
its
traditional
role,
it
is
a
statutory
role,
that
is
not
a
review
in
the
sense
a
petitioner
uses
it
or
that
the
dissent
in
the
court
below
uses
it.
now,
i
wish
to
point
out
here
that
some
of
the
underlying
argument
that
must
necessarily
appear
in
this
case,
is
the
suggestion
that
the
boards
of
contract
appeals,
i
saw
this
suggestion,
i
will
state
it
specifically.
act
for
the
head
of
the
department
that
they
are
responsible
to
the
same
authorities
as
is
for
example
the
contracting
officer.
in
a
broad
sense
that
is
true.
the
board
of
contract
appeals
however,
and
the
atomic
energy
commission
or
the
hearing
examiner
if
you
will
in
this
case
act
solely
in
a
judicial
capacity.
we
call
it
quasi
judicial
because
they
are
not
judges,
but
their
sole
function
is
a
judicial
one.
the
proceedings
that
appear
before
them,
that
go
on
before
them
are
adversary
ones.
to
the
extent
that
any
administrative
proceeding
can
be,
particularly,
in
the
last
few
years,
it
is
a
full
due
process
hearing
based
upon
a
record,
no
ex
parte
communication.
now,
the
suggestion
must
be,
if
the
government
cannot
challenge
the
decision
of
such
a
body,
that,
that
body
is
not
in
partial,
that
that
body
always
renders
a
decision,
which
the
government
would
have
no
reason
to
question.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
otherwise.
as
with
any
judicial
body,
they
maybe
wrong,
they
can
always
issue
a
decision
which
maybe
erroneous
as
a
matter
of
law,
just
as
any
court
may.
the
evidence
upon
which
they
rely
may
not
amount
to
substantial
evidence.
i
should
add
that
there
is
no
suggestion,
i
am
sure
no
rational
suggestion
such
is
made
one
of
the
dissent
below
that,
what
we
do
here
is
try
to
re-weigh
the
evidence
in
the
sense
of
seeing,
if
there
is
a
preponderance
of
evidence
to
overcome
the
findings
of
the
court
below
or
a
less
than
a
preponderance
to
overcome
the
board
below,
that
is
not
so.
we
know
what
substantial
evidence
is,
we
do
not
retry
the
case
and
neither
does
the
petitioner
retry
the
case
in
the
court
of
claims
as
he
suggests
when
it
is
challenged.
because
all
determinations
are
made
on
that
record
as
this
court
said
it
must
and
it
be
on
the
case.
mr.
irving
jaffe
no
amounts
have
been
determined.
the
comptroller
general
determine
in
no
amount
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
well,
generally
they
may
because
at
the
time
that
the
comptroller
general
expressed
his
opinion
that
the
wunderlich
act
standards
would
not
be
met
by
the
decisions
in
this
case.
the
negotiation
was
going
forward
between
the
contractor
and
the
contracting
officer
to
determine
the
amounts
that
would
be
due
under
the
claims
that
had
been
approved
and
allowed
by
the
commission
and
the
hearing
examiner.
indeed,
the
claims
that
were
sent
over
by
the
certifying
officer,
were
part
of
these
disputes.
those
were
the
ones
that
in
the
commission’s
first
order,
it
had
decided
not
to
review
and
in
which
the
amount
would
fit.
for
that
reason,
the
certifying
officer
was
requested
to
pay
it.
and
it
was
that
request
that
he
sent
over
to
the
general
accounting
office.
now,
the
general
accounting
office
went
into
all
the
claims
because
one
of
them,
at
least
one
of
them
has
represented
a
claim
by
us,
that
is
an
offset
by
us,
that
would
depend
on
whether
or
not
the
contractor
had
been
entitled
to
extensions
of
time
because
of
delays.
but
that
claim
was
still
under
consideration.
mr.
irving
jaffe
well,
let
me
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
in
this
particular
case,
assuming
that
any
of
the
claims
of
the
contractor
are
upheld
either
way,
either
as
result
of
judicial
action
or
by
this
court
saying
that
the
action
has
already
been
taken
and
no
one
can
question
it,
there
still
would
have
to
be
negotiation
between
the
contractor
and
the
atomic
energy
commission.
no
amounts
have
been
determined.
i
wish
to
add
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
yes,
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
yes,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
commission
in
its
decision
in
sending
it
back
to
the
contracting
officer,
did
so
expressly
would
be
subject
to
return
to
the
commission
if
there
was
any
objection
or
any
dispute
with
respect
to
the
amounts.
yes
that
is
quite
so.
i
wish
also
to
point
out
that
this
court
and
the
court
of
claims
will
never
know
quite
properly
what
the
difference
is
between
the
gao
opinion
and
the
atomic
energy
commission.
because
the
gao
opinion
is
not
properly
before
the
court
nor
may
it
consider
it.
now,
the
commissioner
--
the
gao
opinion
is
before
the
court
in
an
indirect
way
because
the
court’s
commissioner
asked
for
it
and
got
it,
it
is
a
public
document.
mr.
irving
jaffe
no,
except
--
not,
no,
not
with
respect
to
the
report.
no
one
has
considered
and
no
one
has
ever
suggested,
at
least
with
all
the
comptroller
general,
that
his
analysis
is
before
any
court.
it
is
only
the
decision
of
the
atomic
energy
commission
that
is
being
subjected
with
judicial
scrutiny,
no
other
opinion.
now,
i
would
like
to
advert
to
a
point
that
i
should
have
made
sometime
ago
and
started
to.
i
believe
that
the
statute
itself
requires
no
record
to
legislative
history
for
its
clarity
except,
as
i
indicated
earlier
to
show
that
it
does
contemplate;
it
was
intended
to
provide
for
access
to
the
courts
for
judicial
review
for
all
parties.
i
think
our
brief
amply
make
reference
to
the
areas
of
the
legislative
history
which
support
that.
now,
the
--
strangely,
the
petitioner
now
says
that
we
have
access
to
the
courts
only
for
fraud
or
overreaching.
in
other
words,
that
the
wunderlich
act
created
standards
only
for
the
benefit
of
one
party.
of
course,
both
parties
were
subject
to
the
fraud
test
for
over
turning
an
opinion.
but
now,
only
the
government
is
still
held
to
that
standard
but
not
the
contractor,
the
contract
that
has
a
much
more
liberal
law,
standard
of
review.
he
can
receive
a
reversal
if
the
board
was
wrong
as
a
matter
of
law
or
if
the
findings
were
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
the
government
they
say
however
must
show
fraud
no
matter
how
wrong
their
board’s
decision
is,
the
government
may
not
have
a
court,
not
itself,
have
a
court
turn
all
attorneys
or
if
it
is
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence
or
indeed
any
evidence,
the
government
is
not
free
to
have
a
court
pass
upon
that.
now,
that
i
submit
is
directly
contrary,
that
theory,
that
hypothesis
to
the
language
of
the
wunderlich
act.
the
wunderlich
act
says
that
no
provision
of
any
contract
entered
into
relating
to
finality
of
any
decision
of
the
head
of
the
department
shall
be
pleaded
in
any
suit.
but
such
a
decision
shall
be
fined,
now
such
a
decision
means
any
decision.
if
it
is
not
fraudulent
or
capricious
etcetera.
now
it
also
says
that
it
may
not
pleaded
as
being
limited
to
fraud
that
is
not
good
because
of
fraud
but
the
petitioner
says
that
that
is
the
only
allegation
we
can
make.
he
says
the
government
is
required
to
defend
only
on
that
basis,
not
the
other.
i
believe
that
the
argument
is
suspicious
and
i
believe
that
the
congress
intended
and
the
congress
did
provide
standards
for
review
and
those
standards
for
review
are
applicable
to
both
parties
and
it
is
in
the
language
of
i
believe
the
report,
a
two
ways
spree.
mr.
irving
jaffe
no,
i
do
not
think
there
is
a
gap
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
that
in
the
first
sentence
or
the
clause
before
they
proviso
is
specifically
congress's
intention
to
overcome
in
so
many
words,
the
wunderlich
decision.
section
322
overcomes
in
so
many
words,
as
i
see
it,
the
moorman
decision.
and
the
proviso
sets
forth
the
standards
that
congress
thinks
should
form
the
scope
of
judicial
review
for
the
decision
--
or
review
of
the
decision.
i
believe
that
is
a
cohesive
law
with
no
inconsistency.
because
you
will
see
that
in
the
proviso
they
do
include
fraud.
mr.
irving
jaffe
well
i
must
admit
that
i
considered
it
clear
and
had
no
difficulty
between
the
two
provisions.
thank
you.
mr.
irving
jaffe
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
real
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
the
government
may
challenge
in
court
a
decision
favorable
to
a
contractor
rendered
by
an
agency
under
the
standard
disputes
clause,
on
the
ground
that
it
does
not
meet
the
standards
of
the
wunderlich
act.
now
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
only
decision
placed
before
the
court
of
claim
was
not
the
gao's
opinion,
not
anything
that
the
department
justice
had
done
but
the
atomic
energy
commission
decision
and
that
decision
is
challenged.
that
is
the
finality
of
that
decision
is
challenged
in
our
answer
on
the
ground
that
does
not
comport
with
the
standards
of
the
wunderlich
act.
mr.
irving
jaffe
well,
let
me
answer
that
question
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
in
the
normal
course
of
events
as
happens
with
all
of
these
contracts,
the
matter
would
have
been
continued
and
concluded
before
the
contracting
officer
which
was
where
the
atomic
energy
commission
is
centered,
presumably
an
amount
that
was
due,
since
they
found
the
government
liable
on
several
of
the
claims,
would
have
ultimately
been
determined
and
paid
by
the
agency's
disbursing
or
certifying
officer.
however,
i
would
like
to
answer
the
question
that
was
posed
by
mr.
justice
brennan.
suppose
that
the
disbursing
officer
had
not
paid,
this
is
not
a
hypothetical
situation,
except
for
this
particular
case
because
the
disbursing
officer
of
another
agency,
not
so
long
ago
refused
to
pay.
i
say
that
mandamus
would
not
lie,
it's
not
a
ministerial
act
because
that
decision
which
the
disbursing
officer
refused
to
pay
could
be
subjected
to
challenge
by
the
very
device
of
refusing
to
pay.
it
is
not
a
decision
which
requires
payment
unless
it
is
one
which
is
not
fraudulent,
not
arbitrary
or
capricious,
not
clearly
so
erroneous
as
to
imply
bad
faith.
it
must
be
supported
by
substantial
evidence
and
one
step
more,
it
must
be
correct
as
a
matter
of
law
that
section
320,
the
second
section
of
the
wunderlich
act.
so
that
on
any
of
these
grounds,
there
is
no
--
if
there
is
--
any
of
those
grounds
are
not
met,
there
is
no
requirement
to
pay.
now
the
disbursing
officer
assuming
that
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
this
decision
was
infirm
under
the
standards
of
the
wunderlich
act,
could
not
be
compelled
in
mandamus
in
my
opinion
to
pay,
it
is
not
a
ministerial
act
required
and
the
case
that
be
subjected
to
judicial
scrutiny.
in
this
case,
there
has
not
yet
been
a
determination
by
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction,
namely
the
court
of
claims
that
this
decision
of
the
atomic
energy
commission
has
any
viability
whatever
or
that
any
payment
is
required.
the
reason
it
has
not
reached
that
decision
is
because
the
plaintiff
has
contended
and
this
court
has
granted
certiorari
that
the
standards
of
the
wunderlich
act
are
available
only
to
the
contractor,
that
there
was
nothing
under
the
wunderlich
act
which
enabled
the
government
to
challenge
the
decision
of
its
own
agency.
mr.
irving
jaffe
well,
i
think
i
can
answer
that
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
irving
jaffe
well,
i
think
what
you
are
really
asking
me
is
the
mechanics
of
procedure
as
to
how
the
matter
gets
into
court
and
it
can
get
into
court
in
a
variety
of
ways.
the
government
as
congress
in
willis
said,
when
the
question
was
posed
to
it
in
the
consideration
of
the
wunderlich
act,
said
that
it
might
be
the
general
accounting
office,
it
might
be
the
department
of
justice,
it
might
be
the
agency
involved.
now
let
us
assume,
for
example,
another
means
by
which
this
could
have
come
to
court
and
how
the
government
would
have
asserted
its
rights.
suppose,
for
example,
the
disbursing
officer
did
pay
as
what
have
been
true
in
a
normal
course
of
events,
and
then
the
general
accounting
office
in
auditing
these
accounts
looks
at
this
decision
and
comes
to
the
conclusion
that
it's
erroneous
as
a
matter
of
law
on
the
basis
of
the
decision
on
its
face
and
therefore
transmits
it
to
the
department
of
justice
with
the
request
that
we
look
into
for
the
purpose
of
recouping
money
erroneously
or
illegally
paid
because
the
decision
of
an
agency,
under
a
disputes
clause
was
not
entitled
to
finality
under
the
wunderlich
act.
now
that
would
be
another
way
as
the
attorney
general
said
in
his
opinion
of
january
6,
1969
in
which
this
could
be
tested.
mr.
irving
jaffe
well,
the
risk
--
there
is
a
risk,
mr.
justice
brennan,
because
the
statutes
which
govern
the
general
accounting
office
also
provide
that
if
a
payment
is
illegally
or
erroneously
made,
and
i
wouldn't
going
to
the
bad
faith
or
the
other
factors
that
exist,
but
just
plainly
the
illegally
or
erroneously,
that
he
may
charge
the
accountable
officer
for
that
payment
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
--
personally,
or
through
his
bondman.
i
wish
to
mention
in
passing
that
this
is
so
seldom
use
that
i
can
find
no
case
that's
upheld
it
absent
corruption
or
venality,
but
nevertheless
on
its
face
that
is
a
remedy
which
is
available.
and
it
is
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
the
general
practice
is
i
must
admit
to
use
discretion
as
a
better
part
of
valor
and
not
pay.
however,
there
are
innumerable
circumstances
in
which
the
agency
had,
having
received
an
opinion
of
the
general
accounting
office
usually
an
advanced
opinion,
that
a
payment
if
made,
would
be
disallowed
by
him
in
the
subsequent
audit
of
accounts
and
incidentally
the
general
accounting
office
uses
language
which
indicates
that
it's
--
his
opinion,
that
it
is
advisory,
i
advise,
etcetera,
as
he
did
in
this
case.
however,
i
think
will
not
pay,
but
i
submit
that
that's
a
matter
of
prudence,
particularly
in
this
kind
of
a
situation
and
they
should
not
pay
because
it
never
results
in
anything
other
then
a
resort
to
the
courts
where
and
no
one
has
ever
contended
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
one
of
two
things.
he
would
examine
as
he
did
in
this
case.
the
decision
--
the
attorney
general
did
not
get
into
this
suit
at
all
for
any
purpose
or
in
any
way
interfered
or
intervened
in
the
disputes
process
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
--
until
the
lawsuit
was
filed.
when
we
received
the
petitions
that
were
filed
in
the
court
of
claims,
we
did
with
that
petition
exactly
what
we
do
with
every
other
petitions,
summons
or
complaints
which
we
receive.
we
obtain
from
the
interested
agency,
all
the
background
data,
their
advice
and
assistance
which
we
got
here
and
we
examine
into
it.
we
were
aware
at
that
point
of
the
action
of
the
comptroller
general.
we
paid
no
attention
to
it
because
we
knew
that
what
they
say
was
not
binding
in
court
and
that
we
had
a
statutory
responsibility
to
exercise
a
litigative
judgment.
mr.
irving
jaffe
we
certainly
could
have
as
we
did
in
another
case
not
so
long
ago
where
the
gao
was
not
involved
i
must
admit,
but
where
the
disbursing
officer
refuse
to
pay.
the
decision
of
the
board
of
contract
appeals
of
his
agency
because
he
thought
it
was
an
unsound
decision.
we
disagreed
with
that
disbursing
officer
and
confessed
to
the
entry
of
judgment,
and
it
was
a
substantial
sum.
now
in
this
particular
case,
we
did
examine
the
record,
that
is
the
record
before
the
agency,
we
examined
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
evidence
that
was
submitted.
we
examined
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
decisions
of
the
hearing
examiner
which
were
not
disturbed
by
the
atomic
energy
commission
and
we
examined
the
decision
of
the
atomic
energy
commission
to
the
extent
that
it
passed
on
any
other
claims.
we
came
to
the
conclusion
which
only
coincidental
was
almost
the
same
as
that
of
the
comptroller
general,
that
this
decision,
in
this
case,
did
not
satisfy
the
standards
of
the
wunderlich
act.
mr.
irving
jaffe
oh!
i
think
we
could,
if
we
had
no
wunderlich
act
because
i
do
not
think
that
there
was
anything
in
the
wunderlich
act
or
in
the
judicial
precedence
which
would
make
that
kind
of
a
contract
provision
unenforceable.
however,
i
do
want
to
add
that
the
language
in
this
contract
tracks
the
language
of
the
wunderlich
act
and
is
virtually
the
same,
and
i
call
to
the
court's
attention
that
the
wunderlich
act
is
worded
that
in
terms
of
no
provision
of
any
contract
may
limit
finality
only
to
fraud,
provided
however
that
finality
will
attach
unless
the
decision
of
the
head
of
an
agency
or
the
board
of
contract
appeals.
so
the
fact
that
the
aec
in
this
case
was
the
agency
whose
decision
is
itself
does
not
make
it
any
different
at
all
from
that
of
a
board
of
contract
appeals,
there
is
no
immunization
from
the
--
any
greater
immunization
from
the
head
of
the
department
between
a
board
of
contract
appeals
and
the
head
of
the
agency
itself.
now
of
course,
the
way
the
petitioner
would
have
this
court
construe
this
contract
would
be
in
direct
contravention
of
the
language
of
the
wunderlich
act.
the
petitioner
contends
that
the
disputes
clause
in
this
contract
must
be
read
as
he
argues,
as
limiting
the
government
to
setting
a
decision
of
an
agency
aside
only
if
it
can
show
fraud
or
overreaching.
that
the
entire
history
says
he,
which
we
dispute
of
the
wunderlich
act
shows
that
the
recourse
to
the
courts
for
judicial
review
was
intended
to
be
available
only
to
the
contract
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
actually
written
by
the
general
accounting
office
in
my
opinion.
mr.
irving
jaffe
well
of
course,
the
general
accounting
office
never
had
that
in
mind
as
the
legislative
history
clearly
shows.
mr.
irving
jaffe
the
general
accounting
office
repeatedly
stated
to
the
committee
that
it
was
acting
for
this
legislation
not
only
for
the
benefit
of
the
contractor,
but
because
the
narrow
limited
test
of
fraud
hampered
the
government
and
hampered
the
gao
in
auditing
accounts.
mr.
irving
jaffe
yes.
mr.
irving
jaffe
now
yes
–
now
let
me
comment
on
that
mr.
justice
brennan.
the
original
statute
as
drafted
by
gao
i
believe
included
unless
the
general
accounting
office
or
a
court
found
etcetera,
etcetera.
now
the
interpretation
of
that
clause
in
my
opinion
would
have
equated
the
general
accounting
office
precisely
as
if
it
were
a
court,
it
would
have
had
authority
to
reverse
an
opinion
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
yes.
it
itself
suggested
the
substitute
which
eliminated
the
words
general
accounting
office
or
a
court.
now
of
course
the
statute
speaks
in
terms
of
judicial
review
and
there
was
never
any
question
of
access
to
a
court.
mr.
irving
jaffe
yes
and
the
gao
felt
at
that
time
and
i
submit
to
this
court
that
they
were
correct,
that
the
gao
authority
would
not
be
hampered,
that
is
the
authority
that
they
wanted
to
have
and
that
they
felt
they
always
did
have
before
this
court's
decision
in
the
wunderlich
case.
the
--
that
to
in
auditing
accounts
to
use
a
broader
standard
of
review
and
indeed
they
must.
for
them
to
determine
whether
a
payment
is
or
will
be
illegal
or
unlawful,
or
within
the
contemplation
of
statute
or
law,
they
must
apply
the
applicable
principles
of
law.
in
a
contract
dispute,
those
applicable
principles
and
the
standards
to
be
applied
are
those
set
forth
in
the
wunderlich
act.
so
whether
or
not
they
are
mentioned
when
they
audit
accounts,
when
they
render
an
advance
opinion
in
order
to
determine
whether
it
is
or
will
be
a
lawful
expenditure,
they
must
apply
the
applicable
law,
the
wunderlich
act.
now
the
–-
there
is
no
suggestion
i'm
sure
and
none
have
been
made,
that
the
wunderlich
act
in
any
way
repealed
those
provisions
of
the
law
which
give
to
the
general
accounting
office
the
authority
to
render
an
advance
opinion
to
a
certifying
officer
as
was
the
case
here
or
to
audit
accounts
and
to
disallow
items
which
were
illegally
or
erroneously
paid.
now
in
a
contract
matter
that
must
be
the
standard
of
the
wunderlich
act.
now
i
will
not
dwell
on
the
legislative
history
because
we
believe
that
it
supports
the
view
that
the
government
has
equal
access
to
the
courts
for
the
contract
without
question.
however,
the
legislative
history
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
i
mean
any
of
the
agency,
the
general
accounting
office
or
the
department
of
justice.
i
think
what
we
are
really
speaking
about
is
not
who
is
the
only
person
who
may
speak,
but
who
and
under
what
circumstances
can
the
matter
be
precipitated
into
a
court
review.
now
i
think
that
that
can
occur
in
many
ways.
i
think
the
most
usual
way
would
be
by
failing
to
pay.
now
who
is
going
to
make
that
determination?
perhaps
the
best
answer
is
how
that
determination
has
been
made
and
there
are
many
instances
which
have
occurred
in
the
past
prior
to
this
case,
prior
to
the
(inaudible)
case,
there
are
many
cases
that
mr.
--
that
judge
--
that
judge
davis
of
the
court
of
claims
detailed
in
the
line
of
case.
the
usual
way
is
not
to
pay
and
who
determines
that?
normally
it's
the
general
counsel
of
the
agency,
who
--
and
how
does
that
come
about?
the
angry
trial
attorney
that
we
always
have
him,
the
angry
trial
attorney
who
has
lost
the
case
before
his
board,
who
feels
that
the
board
was
wrong,
that
they
have
no
legal
sense
that
they
are
way
off
base,
complains
to
the
general
counsel.
in
99
cases
out
of
a
100,
he
addresses
(inaudible)
perhaps
even
more,
but
occasionally
the
general
counsel
is
persuaded
and
the
general
counsel
will
block
the
payment.
it
doesn't
go
to
gao
at
all
and
that
precipitates
payment.
occasionally
the
matter
will
be
submitted
to
the
department
of
justice.
somebody
in
the
agency
and
it
has
to
be
someone
high
up
because
we
do
not
accept
communications
from
trial
attorneys
or
lower
stafficial
ones,
there
is
someone
in
the
general
counsel's
office
or
an
assistant
secretary
will
write
to
us
and
say
they
are
disturbed
about
an
opinion
as
did
mason,
as
did
faa,
as
did
several
agencies,
and
the
question
they
asked
us
is
not
to
intervene
in
the
disputes
process,
as
the
petitioner
would
have
you
believe,
the
decision
has
already
been
rendered.
the
disputes
process
is
at
a
close.
the
question
is
if
we
don't
pay
will
you
defend
us?
will
this
withstand
scrutiny?
now
so
far
unfortunately
we
found
that
it
wouldn't
withstand
scrutiny.
all
we
could
find
is
that
if
we
were
the
judges,
we
would
have
decided
differently,
but
that's
no
reason
for
challenging,
as
the
courts
have
frequently
said.
we
haven't
found
one
yet,
although
several
have
been
submitted
to
us,
where
we
thought
we
would
defend
it,
but
that
is
a
method
in
which
it
could
be
done.
sometimes
the
gao
will
come
across
it
either
by
advance
opinion
as
happened
here
or
perhaps
in
a
post
audit.
i
can't
imagine
how
else
at
the
moment,
although
there
maybe
other
ways,
it
would
come
--
the
government
would
have
this
right
of
appeal
which
i
submit
is
a
misnomer.
we're
not
appealing,
we
are
seeking
judicial
review.
we
don't
change
the
opinion,
neither
department
of
justice
did,
the
gao
did
not.
the
only
opinion
before
the
court
is
the
atomic
energy
commission
opinion.
it
is
not
true
to
say
that
they
still
are
restraining
at
the
least
to
pay
this
man,
want
to
go
forward.
they've
assisted
us
in
our
defense.
they
are
yielding,
whether
or
not
they
still
agree
with
their
decision,
they
are
yielding
to
the
possibility
that
the
gao
was
reasonable
or
maybe
right.
mr.
irving
jaffe
it
lost
complete
control
your
honor,
but
i
am
speaking
about
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
that
is
correct.
mr.
irving
jaffe
that
probably
would
have
been
the
end
of
the
matter
but
perhaps
not.
i
should
remind
the
court
of
the
possibility
that
in
this
particular
case,
for
example,
the
comptroller
general
having
written
a
260-page
opinion
might
not
have
ignored
the
matter
had
it
been
paid.
but
he
would
be
powerless
to
do
anything
except
to
send
it
to
the
department
of
justice
for
prosecution,
either
against
the
surety,
against
the
disbursing
officer,
or
perhaps,
which
is
more
likely,
against
the
recipient
of
the
money
as
in
the
contract
we
could
recoup
it
if
we
agree.
mr.
irving
jaffe
very
very
seldom.
i
should
add
here
--
in
this
particular
case,
the
only
real
relief
available
was
not
to
pay.
the
reason
i
say
that
is
because
prior
to
the
completion
of
this
contract,
the
--
all
payments
there
under,
at
least
six
months
before
the
contract
was
completed
while
it
was
being
performed,
that
all
payments
here
under
were
assigned
to
a
bank.
i
therefore
wonder
why
we
speak
so
much
about
the
--
how
contractor
went
out
of
business,
because
of
the
delay
in
payment.
contractor
received,
almost,
that
is
we
paid
the
full
contract
price
after
this
contract.
these
are
the
extras,
the
things
that
have
not
yet
been
determined
that
they
are
entitled
to
payment
on.
and
any
payment
we
decide
or
is
ultimately
decided
that
s
&
e
contractors
are
entitled
to,
we'll
not
go
to
s
&
e
contractors,
but
to
the
bank,
because
when
they
have
assigned
to
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
no,
there
isn't.
i
merely
say
that,
the
failure
hasn't
thrown
him
out
of
business.
mr.
irving
jaffe
well,
except
from
that
fact
alone,
we
don't
and
therefore,
i
think
it
should
not
be
urged
upon
the
court
that
it
did,
except
from
that
fact
alone
that
the
payments
were
assigned
to
a
bank,
who
alone
is
entitled
to
payment.
there
are
many
factors
we
believe
that
put
them
out
of
business
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
what
issue
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
whether
or
not
the
decision
of
the
atomic
energy
commission
is
entitled
to
finality
under
the
standards
of
the
wunderlich
act.
mr.
irving
jaffe
oh!
we
are
challenging
it
on
two
standards
only,
that
either
is
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence
of
the
commission's
allowances
and
in
many
instances
that
it's
erroneous
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
irving
jaffe
under
the
second
section
that
it
cannot
be
final
on
any
part
of
law.
now
the
--
i
had
been
about
to
speak
briefly
about
the
legislative
history.
the
legislative
history
of
course,
as
some
lawyer
in
the
field
once
said
has
a
little
bit
of
everything
for
everybody
and
therefore
it's
little
confusing.
what
we
had
originally
was
a
proposal,
a
wunderlich
act
proposal,
which
would
have
included
the
gao
equally
with
the
courts.
that
was
deleted
and
the
gao
was
taken
out
and
the
word
court
was
taken
out,
but
we
still
speak
of
the
judicial
review.
it
was
quite
clear,
we
say,
from
the
legislative
history.
two
things
were
quite
clear,
that
this
access
to
the
courts
for
judicial
review
under
the
standard
that
they
were
setting
forth
was
available
to
both
parties.
the
reason
that
i
say
that
it
was
aware
is
because
there
were
bills
before
the
congress,
including
one
presented
by
the
american
bar
association
specifically
to
limit
this
judicial
review
to
the
contractors.
the
congress
did
not
accept
any
of
those.
there
were
debates
on
whether
or
not
this
wouldn't
be
equally
available
to
the
government
as
well
as
the
contractor
and
that
the
congress
had
indicated
that
they
thought
it
was.
there
is
no
suggestion
that
it
isn't
available
to
them
and
there
is
certainly
nothing
on
the
face
of
the
act
which
indicates
that
it
is
available
only
to
the
contractor.
the
act
itself
would
seem
to
make
that
clear.
it
says
any
decision
of
the
head
of
the
department
and
any
such
decision
shall
only
have
finality,
if
it
is
not
fraudulent
or
capricious,
etcetera.
now
it
doesn't
say
any
decision
adverse
to
a
contractor
and
i
don't
think
that,
that
should
be
read
in,
particularly
in
the
light
of
the
legislative
history.
it
is
also
strange,
it
seems
to
me,
that
the
argument
should
be
made,
that
the
wunderlich
act
actually
provides
with
two
standards;
one
standard
for
the
contractor
which
covers
this
entire
panoply
of
broadened
standards
and
quite
another
for
the
government.
the
government
is
limited
to
fraud
and
overreaching,
that
is
precisely
what
it
was
the
wunderlich
act
was
seeking
to
overcome.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
that
were
true,
then
the
language
of
the
wunderlich
act,
which
says
that
no
provision
of
any
contract
shall
limit
any
decision
of
a
head
of
an
agency
or
of
a
board
of
contract
appeals
to
fraud,
would
again
have
to
be
interpolated
as
meaning
only
as
against
the
contractor's
complaint,
but
it
could
be
so
limited
as
far
as
the
government
was
concerned.
i
submit
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
language,
nothing
in
the
history,
nothing
in
logic
which
would
call
for
that
view.
i
submit
that
the
government
should
have
and
does
have
equal
access
to
the
courts
to
challenge
the
decisions
of
an
agency
head
or
of
a
board
of
contract
appeal
on
the
basis
set
forth
in
the
wunderlich
act,
that
is
that
the
standards
there
have
not
been
met,
that
no
finality
should
therefore
attach
to
the
decision
and
therefore,
no
payment,
if
one
is
ordered
should
legally
or
lawfully
be
made
under
such
a
decision.
now
the
question
that's
raised,
who
is
the
government?
i
have
answered
in
the
only
way
that
i
can,
the
normal
way
in
which
the
government
gets
a
case
into
court.
now
that
could
be
done
normally
in
one
of
the
three
ways
i
suggested.
i
don't
think
we
need
to
look
for
any
others,
that's
ample
protection
for
the
government.
the
payment
can
be
made
as
the
attorney
general
said
and
we
can
seek
to
recoup
it
in
a
private
suit
of
our
own,
if
it
in
fact
was
erroneous.
now
we
would
have
to
test
in
that
suit
in
the
district
court.
mr.
irving
jaffe
the
disputes
procedure
goes
on
everyday
in
the
week.
the
involvement
of
not
paying
a
decision
of
a
board
of
contract
appeals
rises
very
rarely.
the
way
that
--
frankly,
the
way
in
which
the
government's
access
to
the
courts
has
arisen
in
the
past
most
frequently
has
been
where
a
contractor
submits
several
claims
to
a
board.
the
board
rules
in
the
contractor's
favor
with
respect
to
three
or
four
of
them
and
rules
against
him
with
respect
to
two
or
three
of
them
and
he
is
to
satisfy
with
the
two
or
three,
which
have
been
adverse
to
him
and
he
institutes
a
suit
in
the
court
of
claims
seeking
to
set
aside
the
board's
decision
with
respect
to
those
which
were
adverse
and
we
in
defending
again,
what
is
the
entire
record.
we
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
board
was
correct
in
denying
the
two
or
three
it
did,
but
was
incorrect
in
allowing
two
of
the
four
that
they
had
allowed
because
it
wasn't
supported,
let's
say
by
substantial
evidence
or
was
erroneous
as
a
matter
of
law.
we
have
done
that
in
many,
many
instances
and
we
have
been
successful
and
in
some.
now
that's
merely
another
manner
in
which
the
government
has
asserted
its
right
to
test
a
decision
rendered
under
the
disputes
clause,
under
the
standards
of
the
wunderlich
act.
now
in
this
particular
case,
payment
was
stopped,
that's
happened
before
too
and
then
the
contractor
goes
into
court.
had
we
paid
this
one,
we
would
never
have
been
able
to
recoup
it
because
we
can't
recoup
it
from
a
bank
and
(inaudible).
31
u.s.c.
203
prohibits
that
procedure,
so
that
we
would
have
been
out.
so
in
this
case,
even
if
it
had
wanted
to
pay
and
let
it
go
the
other
way,
the
atomic
energy
commission
would
have
been
ill-advised
to
do
so.
mr.
irving
jaffe
well,
well
we
do.
i
don't
think
i
am
--
to
be
speaking
myself,
paragraph
20
of
the
petition
in
this
very
case
and
then
here,
it
says,
petitioner
assigned
its
rights
to
amounts
to
be
received
under
this
contract
to
the
first
citizens
bank
of
dallas,
texas,
september
12,
1961,
the
contract
was
completed
and
accepted
in
june
of
1962.
mr.
irving
jaffe
against
the
principle
sir?
mr.
irving
jaffe
oh!
no,
not
against
the
principle,
but
he
would
not
have
received
the
money
and
i
don't
know
that
we
would
have
--
i
mean,
it
would
have
been,
well
that's
correct.
mr.
irving
jaffe
we
don't
know
anything
about
the
situation
there,
although
we
did
know
in
1966,
when
the
payment
had
to
be
made.
mr.
irving
jaffe
it
could,
that
could
be
one
way,
but
i
don't
think
that,
that
should
militate
against
seeking
its
day
in
court
in
other
way.
bear
in
mind,
if
you
please
mr.
chief
justice,
if
this
decision
is
not
entitled
to
finality,
the
payment
should
not
be
made.
so
withholding
the
payment
is
not
in
any
sense
a
penalty,
it's
doing
something
we
may
not
be
required
to
do.
mr.
irving
jaffe
under
the
contract
itself.
we
are
only
required
to
make
certain
payments
under
the
contract.
it's
the
same
as
any
private
dispute,
where
one
of
the
parties
of
the
contract
says
i
don't
owe
you
this
money
and
the
other
says
you
do.
now
this
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
oh!
it
definitely
cannot
be
a
breach
of
contract
because
if
it
were,
then
the
holding
that
as
a
breach
would
be
holding
contrary
to
the
terms
of
the
wunderlich
act.
mr.
irving
jaffe
and
for
the
terms
of
this
contract,
which
tried
here.
mr.
irving
jaffe
he
really
doesn't
have
three
tiers
to
overcome.
all
he
has,
if
it
please
you
mr.
justice
blackmun
--
first,
the
general
accounting
office
is
never
a
threat
to
the
contractor.
he
needn't
wait
one
moment
for
the
general
accounting
office
to
have
or
to
consider
the
advance
opinion
or
any
advance
request
from
any
disbursing
or
certifying
officer.
he
can
go
into
court
immediately
he
hears
that
the
general
accounting
office's
views
has
been
solicited.
so
the
general
accounting
office
provides
no
tier
to
him
at
all.
it
is
one
mean
for
the
government
to
be
aware
that
there
may
be
an
illegal
payment
about
to
made
or
if
it
is
made
to
recoup
it.
that's
the
manner
in
which
the
general
accounting
office
entered
the
picture
but
it's
not
a
tier
of
review
as
such.
now,
the
department
of
justice
comes
in
only
if
an
agency
should
decide
to
ask
the
department
first,
will
you
defend
us
or
in
this
case
for
example,
where
the
comptroller
general
has
issued
an
opinion
in
which
he
says
that
this
would
be
an
invalid
payment,
the
agent
--
the
head
of
the
department
could
come
in
and
say
to
us,
do
i
have
to
listen
to
the
comptroller
general?
and
we
could
as
we
have
as
recently
as
1969,
told
the
agencies
your
accountable
officers
need
not
hear
to
the
comptroller
general.
we
think
you
can
make
the
payment,
and
we
so
direct
you.
so
that
--
i
don't
know
to
what
extent
these
tiers
are
review,
really
are
administrative
hurdles.
all
it
is
really
is,
do
we
have
a
basis
for
defending
a
suit
or
for
prosecuting
a
suit,
and
neither
of
them
do
i
think
the
court
should
assume
that
the
contractor
is
entitled
to
money,
any
money
or
any
payment
until
the
court
has
had
opportunity
to
scrutinize
that
decision
under
the
standards
of
the
wunderlich
act.
until
then,
it
is
not
a
order
or
a
decision
in
types
of
the
finality
which
requires
any
payment.
mr.
irving
jaffe
i
think
that
that's
the
natural
consequence
of
the
wunderlich
act
and
the
terms
of
the
contract
would
require
i.
mr.
irving
jaffe
yes
sir
he
is.
mr.
irving
jaffe
we
can't
avoid
he
is
looking
at,
either
before
or
after,
and
in
either
event
there
will
be
a
suit
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
i
am
not
authorized
to
comment
on
that.
mr.
irving
jaffe
yes
sir.
mr.
irving
jaffe
it
is.
mr.
irving
jaffe
no,
sir
he
is
not.
mr.
irving
jaffe
correct,
except
for
one
provision,
31
u.s.c.
74
and
31
u.s.c.
82d,
give
to
the
comptroller
general
on
request,
the
right
to
render
advance
opinions
which
was
precisely
what
was
done
here.
so
that
he
does
come
into
it
in
a
pre-audit
system,
if
an
executive
branch
officer
that
is
the
disbursing
officer
or
a
certifying
officer
asked
him
for
an
advanced
opinion
and
that
was
what
was
done
here.
mr.
irving
jaffe
and
that's
advisory.
mr.
irving
jaffe
well,
he
becomes
a
referee
with
punch
because
his
decision
is
binding
on
the
agency.
mr.
irving
jaffe
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
simply
this,
whether
in
a
disputes
clause
decision,
the
government
has
the
right
in
a
court
to
challenge
a
decision
favorable
to
the
contractor.
in
this
particular
case,
the
decision
of
the
atomic
energy
commission
or
that
of
its
hearing
examiners
which
was
not
disturbed
is
still
the
only
decision
that
was
handed
down.
it
is
the
only
decision
that
is
before
the
court
of
claims,
it
is
the
only
decision
that
the
pleadings
placed
before
the
court
of
claims
and
to
which
the
answer
and
petition
were
addressed.
the
general
accounting
office
did
not
change
that
decision.
the
department
of
justice
did
not
change
that
decision.
there
has
been
no
review
in
the
sense
that
the
petitioner
alleges
which
has
altered
or
in
anyway
interfered
with
the
atomic
energy’s
commission
except
to
subject
that
the
decision
itself
was
not
final
and
not
being
final,
that
payment
could
not
be
made
there
under.
now,
the
atomic
energy
commission
may
disagree
with
that.
it
may
feel
that
the
decision
which
is
handed
down
is
sound.
even
so,
it
seems
to
me
it
is
the
height
of
prudence.
if
the
suggestion
is
made
to
it
by
gao,
by
its
own
general
counsel,
by
any
respected
attorney
that
if
there
is
doubt
cast
on
whether
or
not
the
criteria
for
finality
as
enunciated
in
the
wunderlich
act
have
not
been
met,
then
payment
should
not
be
made
as
one
way
in
which
judicial
review
can
be
compelled,
so
that
the
standards
of
finality
may
be
applied
to
that
decision.
furthermore,
it
might
very
well
be
suggested
and
if
it
is
not
so,
that
payment
would
have
been
improper
under
those
circumstances,
because
payment
is
only
required
in
connection
with
a
final
decision
of
an
agency
or
a
board
of
contract
appeal.
now,
the
general
accounting
office
did
nothing
more
than
review
this.
they
reviewed
it
in
response
to
a
request
from
a
certifying
officer.
that
certifying
officer
was
acting
under
a
statute
which
gave
it
--
give
him
the
permission
and
the
authority
to
seek
an
advanced
opinion
as
to
what
the
accounting
treatment
would
be
in
the
event
a
payment
which
he
was
asked
to
make
be
made.
the
general
accounting
office
in
considering
that,
that
request
was
discharging
a
statutory
duty.
in
discharging
that
statutory
duty,
it
was
required
to
determine
whether
or
not
and
if
this
payment
were
made
and
it
was
making
a
post
audit,
would
it
accept
to
it,
would
it
disallow
it.
and
in
making
that
determination,
it
must
apply
of
course
the
applicable
principles
of
law.
in
a
disputes
situation,
the
only
applicable
principles
of
law
are
the
standards
provided
by
the
wunderlich
act.
the
wunderlich
act
says
that
a
payment
that
is
a
decision
will
be
final,
if
it
is
not
fraudulent,
if
it
is
not
arbitrary
or
capricious,
is
supported
by
substantial
evidence,
or
is
not
so
clearly
erroneous
or
not
so
grossly
erroneous
as
to
imply
bad
faith.
now,
those
are
the
principles
which
he
must
apply.
and
in
applying
those,
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
if
he
were
to
review
this,
he
does
not
think
that
the
decision
met
those
standards,
therefore,
he
would
be
compelled
to
disallow
it.
and
he
so
advised,
it
was
only
advice
to
the
commission.
what
he
told
the
commission
was,
that
if
you
make
this
payment,
i
will
be
compelled
to
disallow
it.
he
did
not
say
you
cannot
make
it.
he
could
not
say
you
cannot
make
it
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
yes,
it
is
a
deterrent,
but
it
is
a
not
a
legal
deterrent.
it
is
a
deterrent
in
that
no
one
wants
to
risk
having
a
payment
disallowed.
but
how
bad
a
deterrent
is
that
mr.
chief
justice,
if
you
know
that
the
matter
can
be
submitted
to
a
court,
is
submission
of
an
issue
to
a
court
for
final
determination.
such
a
great
risk
or
is
it
such
a
great
burden
that
everyone
should
shy
clear
of
it?
all
that
it
does
and
all
that
the
general
accounting
officer
can
do
is
take
an
action
that
will
precipitate
judicial
review.
would
it
have
made
any
difference
if
the
payments
had
been
made?
and
then
the
department
of
justice
at
the
request,
either
of
gao
or
of
the
agency,
had
sued
for
a
three
turn
on
the
ground
that
it
was
an
illegal
payment,
because
it
was
not
paid
in
pursuance
of
a
final
decision.
the
judicial
review
would
have
occurred
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
irving
jaffe
in
the
district
court,
because
in
the
court
of
claims,
the
defendant
is
always
the
united
states
and
not
the
plaintiff.
now,
the
petitioner
has
alleged
that
the
gravamen
of
this
suit
is
the
intervention
and
inter-possession
of
the
comptroller
general.
it
is
the
contention
of
the
government
that
the
role
of
the
general
accounting
office
played
in
this
case
is
wholly
irrelevant
to
the
issue,
the
issue
being
whether
or
not,
a
favorable
decision
to
a
contract
that
maybe
challenged
by
the
government
in
court.
now,
the
action
of
the
general
accounting
office
is
in
our
opinion
irrelevant
because
it
did
not
precipitate
the
suit.
and
even
if
it
did,
it
does
not
make
any
difference
because
that
only
gives
rise
at
that
point,
whether
or
not,
we
can
challenge
it.
but
i
do
not
believe
that
it
precipitated
the
suit
any
more
than
the
certifying
officer
precipitated
the
suit
in
addressing
an
inquiry
to
it.
what
did
precipitate
the
suit
by
the
petitioner
instead
of
by
the
government
was
the
failure
of
the
atomic
energy
commission
to
make
payment.
now,
the
legislative
history
which
the
petitioner’s
brief
devotes
a
good
deal
of
space
too
is,
in
our
opinion,
significant
only
and
that,
it
shows
that
congress
did
intend
or
access
to
the
courts
to
test
the
finality
criteria
of
that
act
to
be
available
to
both
parties
and
not
to
one.
the
petitioner,
it
seems
to
me,
goes
far
afield
when
he
addresses
his
remarks
to
the
role
of
the
gao
was
at
one
time
intended
to
play
in
this
situation.
some
of
the
statutes,
not
the
initial
one,
shortly
thereafter,
included
the
general
accounting
office
as
a
level
of
review
equal
to
that
of
the
courts.
at
that
point,
there
was
much
opposition
to
the
inclusion
of
the
general
accounting
office.
the
opposition
came
from
industry
and
from
the
government
and
from
the
private
party.
but
this
review
is
not
the
review
that
was
ever
granted.
that
review
was
the
right
to
change
that
opinion,
to
modify
it,
reverse
it,
to
make
a
binding
determination
on
both
contractual
parties
just
as
would
a
court.
now,
that
was
eliminated.
it
no
longer
has
that,
it
did
not
do
it
now.
this
review
did
not
change
any
part
of
the
decision,
that
being
so,
the
legislative
history
is
only
helpful
for
the
other
aspects
for
which
it
is
mentioned
by
both
parties
and
that
is,
whether
or
not,
the
congress
intended
that
judicial
review
would
be
available
to
both
parties,
the
government
and
the
contractor.
and
in
that
connection,
there
were
proposals
submitted
to
the
congress
expressly
to
limit
judicial
review
or
access
to
the
courts
to
seek
judicial
review
to
the
contractor
alone.
the
congress
did
not
adopt
any
of
those
proposals.
one
of
those
proposals
was
made
by
the
american
bar
association.
their
proposal
confined
judicial
review
to
one
requested
by
the
contractors.
this
was
not
merely
something
that
submitted
to
the
congress
which
may
have
been
overlooked,
because
one
of
the
leading
witnesses
before
the
committees,
mr.
franklin
m.
schultz,
addressed
himself
specifically
to
that
problem.
he
pointed
out
that
the
bill
as
proposed
and
as
enacted
would
on
its
face
appear
to
make
judicial
review
available
to
both
parties.
and
when
congress
has
been
tied,
asked
them
what
was
pointed
out,
that
was
precisely
what
it
would
do
is
to
show
that
is
what
disturbs
me.
precisely
what
disturbs
him
and
then
proposed
that
the
ada
proposal
which
confided
only
to
the
contractor
be
adopted.
and
that
was
not
adopted.
the
congressional
committee
at
least
that
was
considering
it
was
well
aware
of
the
request
by
some
few
people
that
it
be
limited
to
the
contractor.
not
only
that,
mr.
creyke
says
that
at
no
time
did
anyone
assume,
that
anyone,
but
the
general
accounting
office
would
be
an
avenue
for
review
on
behalf
of
the
government.
the
congressional
history
shows
that
mr.
congressman
willis
was
asked
specifically
the
question,
who
on
the
part
of
the
government
would
ask
for
the
judicial
review
and
his
response
was
the
department
of
justice,
the
department
of
defense
as
well
as
the
general
accounting
office.
there
was
nothing
here
that
went
by
unnoticed.
and
the
testimony,
even
the
report,
indicates
very
clearly
that
the
lack
of
judicial
review
in
essence
of
--
as
a
result
of
this
court’s
decisions
in
the
moorman
and
wunderlich
cases,
that
the
lack
of
judicial
review,
meaningful
judicial
review
to
either
of
the
party
worked
as
much
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
government
as
it
did
to
the
contractor.
and
that
both
parties
should
have
a
day
in
court
and
have
access
to
the
court
for
review
in
accordance
with
standards
which
the
congress
believed
would
be
more
meaningful.
and
that
is
precisely
what
the
wunderlich
act
did.
mr.
irving
jaffe
at
the
department
of
justice.
mr.
irving
jaffe
yes,
if
you
use
the
word
review
and
the
sense
of
making
the
mitigative
determinations
which
is
the
responsibility
imposed
upon
it
by
statute.
in
that
sense,
yes,
it
reviews
every
litigation
request
that
comes
before
it.
we
do
not
institute
suit
at
every
request
of
the
agencies
nor
do
we
defend
every
suit
in
which
an
agency
is
sued.
indeed,
in
a
situation
identical
to
this
one.
not
too
long
ago
where
an
agency
did
refuse
to
make
payment
in
accordance
with
a
board
of
contract
appeals
decision,
and
the
contractor
sued
in
the
court
of
claims.
we
did
not
answer
that
case
because
our
review
preparatory
to
filing
an
answer
convinced
us
that
the
decision
of
the
board
was
supported
by
a
substantial
evidence,
did
meet
the
criteria
of
the
wunderlich
act
and
when
the
agency
continue
to
refuse
to
pay,
we
consented
to
the
entry
of
judgment.
mr.
irving
jaffe
pardon.
mr.
irving
jaffe
well,
i
think
i
would
have
to
say
mr.
chief
justice
that
is
an
infrequent
occurrence.
that
is
the
only
instance
of
which
i
know.
i
think
it
is
significant
too,
especially
since
the
petitioner
has
painted
a
black
picture
of
what
happens
if
you
affirm
the
court
of
claims’
decision
in
the
contracting
field,
that
since
at
least,
the
time
when
the
court
of
claims
decided
the
langenfelder
case
in
1965
and
it
set
forth
their
view
that
the
department
of
--
the
government
rather
had
a
right
to
judicial
review
under
the
wunderlich
act
and
to
challenge
a
board
decision.
we
have
not
had
any
flood
of
litigation
in
which
that
has
occurred
nor
even
more
significantly
for
the
past
two-and-half
or
more
years
since
the
attorney
general
had
issued
his
opinion
of
january
1969,
in
which
he
encouraged
the
agencies
to
review
themselves,
the
decisions
of
the
board,
and
if
they
thought
that
one
of
those
decisions
did
not
meet
the
criteria,
to
sent
it
to
the
department
of
justice
for
an
advance
opinion.
we
have
had
very,
very
few
and
as
far
as
i
know,
none
in
which
we
recommended
that
the
decision
be
challenged.
so
i
do
not
anticipate
the
flood
at
all.
mr.
irving
jaffe
yes
sir.
mr.
irving
jaffe
well,
it
is.
i
am
not
certain
mr.
justice
blackmun
that
i
can
give
you
an
adequate
answer.
i
do
not
know
why
it
has
arisen
in
this
form
or
in
any
form
at
this
time
because
i
had
always
been
of
the
impression
that
it
was
a
generally
conceded
right
for
the
government
to
challenge
a
board
decision
that
was
favorable
to
the
contractor.
indeed,
in
the
langenfelder
case,
the
court
then,
judge
davis,
in
a
footnote
or
perhaps
in
the
body
lists,
many
cases
in
which
precisely
that
was
done
since
at
least
the
wunderlich
act.
it
is
very
difficult
to
go
earlier
than
the
wunderlich
act,
because
there
was
very
little
to
review,
on
kind
of
work
both
ways,
neither
the
government
nor
the
contractor
could
upset
a
decision
except
in
case
of
fraud
or
over
reaching.
mr.
irving
jaffe
1954
it
was
enacted.
mr.
irving
jaffe
yes,
yes
it
is.
now,
i
would
like
to
touch
briefly
on
the
role
of
the
department
of
justice
in
all
litigation.
i
have
alluded
to
it
already.
but
as
this
court
knows
the
relationship
between
the
department
of
justice
and
its
client
agencies,
if
i
may
refer
thast
way
to
the
various
department
and
agencies
of
the
government
is
not
the
same
as
the
ordinary
attorney
client.
because
by
statute,
the
department
of
justice
must
make
a
judgment
with
respect
to
whether
litigation
shall
be
pursued
or
instituted
or
whether
or
not,
it
shall
be
defended.
that
requires
it
to
make
a
judgment
on
the
merits
of
the
case.
his
client
cannot
discharge
him.
his
client,
if
you
will,
is
stuck
with
the
department
of
justice.
now,
the
department
of
justice
under
those
circumstances
is
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
a
much
more
serious
review
of
what
is
presented
by
any
litigation
or
what
if,
that
is
either
defensive
or
prosecuted
and
that
decision
is
an
important
one.
therefore,
and
in
this
case,
i
wish
to
point
out
the
department
of
justice
was
not
involved
at
any
stage
in
the
dispute
process
prior
to
the
decision
of
the
atomic
energy
commission.
it
was
not
involved
in
this
case
after
the
decision
of
the
atomic
energy
commission
and
did
not
get
involved
until
we
received
a
copy
of
the
petition
that
had
been
filed
in
the
court
of
claims
by
this
plaintiffs.
at
that
point,
we
did
what
we
are
required
to
do.
we
examined
it,
we
examined
the
petition,
we
looked
at
the
record
before
the
atomic
energy
commission.
we
determined
as
we
had
to,
whether
or
not,
there
were
any
wunderlich
act
defenses
that
could
be
interposed
to
this.
we
came
to
the
conclusion
that
there
were.
in
fact,
we
came
to
the
conclusion
that
there
was
such
a
defense
that
ought
to
be
interposed
with
respect
to
each
and
every
claim
that
was
asserted
in
the
petition,
say
one.
well,
i
am
not
even
sure
of
that.
we
paid
one
but
i
think
we
found
something
objectionable
to
that
too.
now,
that
is
doing
only
what
the
law
requires
us
to
do.
we
must
do
that
for
the
petitioner
to
subject
that
we
had
only
one
function
to
perform,
and
that
is
to
inquire
whether
there
have
been
fraud
or
over
reaching.
and
otherwise,
to
consent
to
the
entry
of
judgment
even
if
it
was
clear
that
there
was
no
evidence
to
support
the
decision.
or
that,
it
was
clearly
erroneous
as
a
matter
of
law
or
that
section
322
came
into
play
of
the
wunderlich
act,
that
is
a
question
of
law,
was
decided
wrongfully,
or
should
we
submit
it
to
the
court.
we
did
not
reverse
the
decision,
we
did
decide
that
the
court
ought
to
pass
on
it,
and
that
is
what
our
answer
does,
confined
to
the
record
before
the
atomic
energy
commission.
no
one
placed
before
the
court
of
claims,
the
lengthy
opinion
of
the
general
accounting
office.
no
one
submitted
to
the
court
of
claims,
saving
our
answer.
any
of
the
analysis
of
the
department
of
justice
has
though
or
an
opinion
or
a
review
which
have
any,
any
effect
on
this
decision
or
changed
it
in
any
way.
that
is
the
role
of
the
department
of
justice.
it
is
its
traditional
role,
it
is
a
statutory
role,
that
is
not
a
review
in
the
sense
a
petitioner
uses
it
or
that
the
dissent
in
the
court
below
uses
it.
now,
i
wish
to
point
out
here
that
some
of
the
underlying
argument
that
must
necessarily
appear
in
this
case,
is
the
suggestion
that
the
boards
of
contract
appeals,
i
saw
this
suggestion,
i
will
state
it
specifically.
act
for
the
head
of
the
department
that
they
are
responsible
to
the
same
authorities
as
is
for
example
the
contracting
officer.
in
a
broad
sense
that
is
true.
the
board
of
contract
appeals
however,
and
the
atomic
energy
commission
or
the
hearing
examiner
if
you
will
in
this
case
act
solely
in
a
judicial
capacity.
we
call
it
quasi
judicial
because
they
are
not
judges,
but
their
sole
function
is
a
judicial
one.
the
proceedings
that
appear
before
them,
that
go
on
before
them
are
adversary
ones.
to
the
extent
that
any
administrative
proceeding
can
be,
particularly,
in
the
last
few
years,
it
is
a
full
due
process
hearing
based
upon
a
record,
no
ex
parte
communication.
now,
the
suggestion
must
be,
if
the
government
cannot
challenge
the
decision
of
such
a
body,
that,
that
body
is
not
in
partial,
that
that
body
always
renders
a
decision,
which
the
government
would
have
no
reason
to
question.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
otherwise.
as
with
any
judicial
body,
they
maybe
wrong,
they
can
always
issue
a
decision
which
maybe
erroneous
as
a
matter
of
law,
just
as
any
court
may.
the
evidence
upon
which
they
rely
may
not
amount
to
substantial
evidence.
i
should
add
that
there
is
no
suggestion,
i
am
sure
no
rational
suggestion
such
is
made
one
of
the
dissent
below
that,
what
we
do
here
is
try
to
re-weigh
the
evidence
in
the
sense
of
seeing,
if
there
is
a
preponderance
of
evidence
to
overcome
the
findings
of
the
court
below
or
a
less
than
a
preponderance
to
overcome
the
board
below,
that
is
not
so.
we
know
what
substantial
evidence
is,
we
do
not
retry
the
case
and
neither
does
the
petitioner
retry
the
case
in
the
court
of
claims
as
he
suggests
when
it
is
challenged.
because
all
determinations
are
made
on
that
record
as
this
court
said
it
must
and
it
be
on
the
case.
mr.
irving
jaffe
no
amounts
have
been
determined.
the
comptroller
general
determine
in
no
amount
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
well,
generally
they
may
because
at
the
time
that
the
comptroller
general
expressed
his
opinion
that
the
wunderlich
act
standards
would
not
be
met
by
the
decisions
in
this
case.
the
negotiation
was
going
forward
between
the
contractor
and
the
contracting
officer
to
determine
the
amounts
that
would
be
due
under
the
claims
that
had
been
approved
and
allowed
by
the
commission
and
the
hearing
examiner.
indeed,
the
claims
that
were
sent
over
by
the
certifying
officer,
were
part
of
these
disputes.
those
were
the
ones
that
in
the
commission’s
first
order,
it
had
decided
not
to
review
and
in
which
the
amount
would
fit.
for
that
reason,
the
certifying
officer
was
requested
to
pay
it.
and
it
was
that
request
that
he
sent
over
to
the
general
accounting
office.
now,
the
general
accounting
office
went
into
all
the
claims
because
one
of
them,
at
least
one
of
them
has
represented
a
claim
by
us,
that
is
an
offset
by
us,
that
would
depend
on
whether
or
not
the
contractor
had
been
entitled
to
extensions
of
time
because
of
delays.
but
that
claim
was
still
under
consideration.
mr.
irving
jaffe
well,
let
me
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
in
this
particular
case,
assuming
that
any
of
the
claims
of
the
contractor
are
upheld
either
way,
either
as
result
of
judicial
action
or
by
this
court
saying
that
the
action
has
already
been
taken
and
no
one
can
question
it,
there
still
would
have
to
be
negotiation
between
the
contractor
and
the
atomic
energy
commission.
no
amounts
have
been
determined.
i
wish
to
add
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
yes,
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
yes,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
commission
in
its
decision
in
sending
it
back
to
the
contracting
officer,
did
so
expressly
would
be
subject
to
return
to
the
commission
if
there
was
any
objection
or
any
dispute
with
respect
to
the
amounts.
yes
that
is
quite
so.
i
wish
also
to
point
out
that
this
court
and
the
court
of
claims
will
never
know
quite
properly
what
the
difference
is
between
the
gao
opinion
and
the
atomic
energy
commission.
because
the
gao
opinion
is
not
properly
before
the
court
nor
may
it
consider
it.
now,
the
commissioner
--
the
gao
opinion
is
before
the
court
in
an
indirect
way
because
the
court’s
commissioner
asked
for
it
and
got
it,
it
is
a
public
document.
mr.
irving
jaffe
no,
except
--
not,
no,
not
with
respect
to
the
report.
no
one
has
considered
and
no
one
has
ever
suggested,
at
least
with
all
the
comptroller
general,
that
his
analysis
is
before
any
court.
it
is
only
the
decision
of
the
atomic
energy
commission
that
is
being
subjected
with
judicial
scrutiny,
no
other
opinion.
now,
i
would
like
to
advert
to
a
point
that
i
should
have
made
sometime
ago
and
started
to.
i
believe
that
the
statute
itself
requires
no
record
to
legislative
history
for
its
clarity
except,
as
i
indicated
earlier
to
show
that
it
does
contemplate;
it
was
intended
to
provide
for
access
to
the
courts
for
judicial
review
for
all
parties.
i
think
our
brief
amply
make
reference
to
the
areas
of
the
legislative
history
which
support
that.
now,
the
--
strangely,
the
petitioner
now
says
that
we
have
access
to
the
courts
only
for
fraud
or
overreaching.
in
other
words,
that
the
wunderlich
act
created
standards
only
for
the
benefit
of
one
party.
of
course,
both
parties
were
subject
to
the
fraud
test
for
over
turning
an
opinion.
but
now,
only
the
government
is
still
held
to
that
standard
but
not
the
contractor,
the
contract
that
has
a
much
more
liberal
law,
standard
of
review.
he
can
receive
a
reversal
if
the
board
was
wrong
as
a
matter
of
law
or
if
the
findings
were
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
the
government
they
say
however
must
show
fraud
no
matter
how
wrong
their
board’s
decision
is,
the
government
may
not
have
a
court,
not
itself,
have
a
court
turn
all
attorneys
or
if
it
is
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence
or
indeed
any
evidence,
the
government
is
not
free
to
have
a
court
pass
upon
that.
now,
that
i
submit
is
directly
contrary,
that
theory,
that
hypothesis
to
the
language
of
the
wunderlich
act.
the
wunderlich
act
says
that
no
provision
of
any
contract
entered
into
relating
to
finality
of
any
decision
of
the
head
of
the
department
shall
be
pleaded
in
any
suit.
but
such
a
decision
shall
be
fined,
now
such
a
decision
means
any
decision.
if
it
is
not
fraudulent
or
capricious
etcetera.
now
it
also
says
that
it
may
not
pleaded
as
being
limited
to
fraud
that
is
not
good
because
of
fraud
but
the
petitioner
says
that
that
is
the
only
allegation
we
can
make.
he
says
the
government
is
required
to
defend
only
on
that
basis,
not
the
other.
i
believe
that
the
argument
is
suspicious
and
i
believe
that
the
congress
intended
and
the
congress
did
provide
standards
for
review
and
those
standards
for
review
are
applicable
to
both
parties
and
it
is
in
the
language
of
i
believe
the
report,
a
two
ways
spree.
mr.
irving
jaffe
no,
i
do
not
think
there
is
a
gap
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
that
in
the
first
sentence
or
the
clause
before
they
proviso
is
specifically
congress's
intention
to
overcome
in
so
many
words,
the
wunderlich
decision.
section
322
overcomes
in
so
many
words,
as
i
see
it,
the
moorman
decision.
and
the
proviso
sets
forth
the
standards
that
congress
thinks
should
form
the
scope
of
judicial
review
for
the
decision
--
or
review
of
the
decision.
i
believe
that
is
a
cohesive
law
with
no
inconsistency.
because
you
will
see
that
in
the
proviso
they
do
include
fraud.
mr.
irving
jaffe
well
i
must
admit
that
i
considered
it
clear
and
had
no
difficulty
between
the
two
provisions.
thank
you.
mr.
irving
jaffe
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
real
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
the
government
may
challenge
in
court
a
decision
favorable
to
a
contractor
rendered
by
an
agency
under
the
standard
disputes
clause,
on
the
ground
that
it
does
not
meet
the
standards
of
the
wunderlich
act.
now
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
only
decision
placed
before
the
court
of
claim
was
not
the
gao's
opinion,
not
anything
that
the
department
justice
had
done
but
the
atomic
energy
commission
decision
and
that
decision
is
challenged.
that
is
the
finality
of
that
decision
is
challenged
in
our
answer
on
the
ground
that
does
not
comport
with
the
standards
of
the
wunderlich
act.
mr.
irving
jaffe
well,
let
me
answer
that
question
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
in
the
normal
course
of
events
as
happens
with
all
of
these
contracts,
the
matter
would
have
been
continued
and
concluded
before
the
contracting
officer
which
was
where
the
atomic
energy
commission
is
centered,
presumably
an
amount
that
was
due,
since
they
found
the
government
liable
on
several
of
the
claims,
would
have
ultimately
been
determined
and
paid
by
the
agency's
disbursing
or
certifying
officer.
however,
i
would
like
to
answer
the
question
that
was
posed
by
mr.
justice
brennan.
suppose
that
the
disbursing
officer
had
not
paid,
this
is
not
a
hypothetical
situation,
except
for
this
particular
case
because
the
disbursing
officer
of
another
agency,
not
so
long
ago
refused
to
pay.
i
say
that
mandamus
would
not
lie,
it's
not
a
ministerial
act
because
that
decision
which
the
disbursing
officer
refused
to
pay
could
be
subjected
to
challenge
by
the
very
device
of
refusing
to
pay.
it
is
not
a
decision
which
requires
payment
unless
it
is
one
which
is
not
fraudulent,
not
arbitrary
or
capricious,
not
clearly
so
erroneous
as
to
imply
bad
faith.
it
must
be
supported
by
substantial
evidence
and
one
step
more,
it
must
be
correct
as
a
matter
of
law
that
section
320,
the
second
section
of
the
wunderlich
act.
so
that
on
any
of
these
grounds,
there
is
no
--
if
there
is
--
any
of
those
grounds
are
not
met,
there
is
no
requirement
to
pay.
now
the
disbursing
officer
assuming
that
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
this
decision
was
infirm
under
the
standards
of
the
wunderlich
act,
could
not
be
compelled
in
mandamus
in
my
opinion
to
pay,
it
is
not
a
ministerial
act
required
and
the
case
that
be
subjected
to
judicial
scrutiny.
in
this
case,
there
has
not
yet
been
a
determination
by
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction,
namely
the
court
of
claims
that
this
decision
of
the
atomic
energy
commission
has
any
viability
whatever
or
that
any
payment
is
required.
the
reason
it
has
not
reached
that
decision
is
because
the
plaintiff
has
contended
and
this
court
has
granted
certiorari
that
the
standards
of
the
wunderlich
act
are
available
only
to
the
contractor,
that
there
was
nothing
under
the
wunderlich
act
which
enabled
the
government
to
challenge
the
decision
of
its
own
agency.
mr.
irving
jaffe
well,
i
think
i
can
answer
that
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
irving
jaffe
well,
i
think
what
you
are
really
asking
me
is
the
mechanics
of
procedure
as
to
how
the
matter
gets
into
court
and
it
can
get
into
court
in
a
variety
of
ways.
the
government
as
congress
in
willis
said,
when
the
question
was
posed
to
it
in
the
consideration
of
the
wunderlich
act,
said
that
it
might
be
the
general
accounting
office,
it
might
be
the
department
of
justice,
it
might
be
the
agency
involved.
now
let
us
assume,
for
example,
another
means
by
which
this
could
have
come
to
court
and
how
the
government
would
have
asserted
its
rights.
suppose,
for
example,
the
disbursing
officer
did
pay
as
what
have
been
true
in
a
normal
course
of
events,
and
then
the
general
accounting
office
in
auditing
these
accounts
looks
at
this
decision
and
comes
to
the
conclusion
that
it's
erroneous
as
a
matter
of
law
on
the
basis
of
the
decision
on
its
face
and
therefore
transmits
it
to
the
department
of
justice
with
the
request
that
we
look
into
for
the
purpose
of
recouping
money
erroneously
or
illegally
paid
because
the
decision
of
an
agency,
under
a
disputes
clause
was
not
entitled
to
finality
under
the
wunderlich
act.
now
that
would
be
another
way
as
the
attorney
general
said
in
his
opinion
of
january
6,
1969
in
which
this
could
be
tested.
mr.
irving
jaffe
well,
the
risk
--
there
is
a
risk,
mr.
justice
brennan,
because
the
statutes
which
govern
the
general
accounting
office
also
provide
that
if
a
payment
is
illegally
or
erroneously
made,
and
i
wouldn't
going
to
the
bad
faith
or
the
other
factors
that
exist,
but
just
plainly
the
illegally
or
erroneously,
that
he
may
charge
the
accountable
officer
for
that
payment
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
--
personally,
or
through
his
bondman.
i
wish
to
mention
in
passing
that
this
is
so
seldom
use
that
i
can
find
no
case
that's
upheld
it
absent
corruption
or
venality,
but
nevertheless
on
its
face
that
is
a
remedy
which
is
available.
and
it
is
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
the
general
practice
is
i
must
admit
to
use
discretion
as
a
better
part
of
valor
and
not
pay.
however,
there
are
innumerable
circumstances
in
which
the
agency
had,
having
received
an
opinion
of
the
general
accounting
office
usually
an
advanced
opinion,
that
a
payment
if
made,
would
be
disallowed
by
him
in
the
subsequent
audit
of
accounts
and
incidentally
the
general
accounting
office
uses
language
which
indicates
that
it's
--
his
opinion,
that
it
is
advisory,
i
advise,
etcetera,
as
he
did
in
this
case.
however,
i
think
will
not
pay,
but
i
submit
that
that's
a
matter
of
prudence,
particularly
in
this
kind
of
a
situation
and
they
should
not
pay
because
it
never
results
in
anything
other
then
a
resort
to
the
courts
where
and
no
one
has
ever
contended
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
one
of
two
things.
he
would
examine
as
he
did
in
this
case.
the
decision
--
the
attorney
general
did
not
get
into
this
suit
at
all
for
any
purpose
or
in
any
way
interfered
or
intervened
in
the
disputes
process
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
--
until
the
lawsuit
was
filed.
when
we
received
the
petitions
that
were
filed
in
the
court
of
claims,
we
did
with
that
petition
exactly
what
we
do
with
every
other
petitions,
summons
or
complaints
which
we
receive.
we
obtain
from
the
interested
agency,
all
the
background
data,
their
advice
and
assistance
which
we
got
here
and
we
examine
into
it.
we
were
aware
at
that
point
of
the
action
of
the
comptroller
general.
we
paid
no
attention
to
it
because
we
knew
that
what
they
say
was
not
binding
in
court
and
that
we
had
a
statutory
responsibility
to
exercise
a
litigative
judgment.
mr.
irving
jaffe
we
certainly
could
have
as
we
did
in
another
case
not
so
long
ago
where
the
gao
was
not
involved
i
must
admit,
but
where
the
disbursing
officer
refuse
to
pay.
the
decision
of
the
board
of
contract
appeals
of
his
agency
because
he
thought
it
was
an
unsound
decision.
we
disagreed
with
that
disbursing
officer
and
confessed
to
the
entry
of
judgment,
and
it
was
a
substantial
sum.
now
in
this
particular
case,
we
did
examine
the
record,
that
is
the
record
before
the
agency,
we
examined
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
evidence
that
was
submitted.
we
examined
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
decisions
of
the
hearing
examiner
which
were
not
disturbed
by
the
atomic
energy
commission
and
we
examined
the
decision
of
the
atomic
energy
commission
to
the
extent
that
it
passed
on
any
other
claims.
we
came
to
the
conclusion
which
only
coincidental
was
almost
the
same
as
that
of
the
comptroller
general,
that
this
decision,
in
this
case,
did
not
satisfy
the
standards
of
the
wunderlich
act.
mr.
irving
jaffe
oh!
i
think
we
could,
if
we
had
no
wunderlich
act
because
i
do
not
think
that
there
was
anything
in
the
wunderlich
act
or
in
the
judicial
precedence
which
would
make
that
kind
of
a
contract
provision
unenforceable.
however,
i
do
want
to
add
that
the
language
in
this
contract
tracks
the
language
of
the
wunderlich
act
and
is
virtually
the
same,
and
i
call
to
the
court's
attention
that
the
wunderlich
act
is
worded
that
in
terms
of
no
provision
of
any
contract
may
limit
finality
only
to
fraud,
provided
however
that
finality
will
attach
unless
the
decision
of
the
head
of
an
agency
or
the
board
of
contract
appeals.
so
the
fact
that
the
aec
in
this
case
was
the
agency
whose
decision
is
itself
does
not
make
it
any
different
at
all
from
that
of
a
board
of
contract
appeals,
there
is
no
immunization
from
the
--
any
greater
immunization
from
the
head
of
the
department
between
a
board
of
contract
appeals
and
the
head
of
the
agency
itself.
now
of
course,
the
way
the
petitioner
would
have
this
court
construe
this
contract
would
be
in
direct
contravention
of
the
language
of
the
wunderlich
act.
the
petitioner
contends
that
the
disputes
clause
in
this
contract
must
be
read
as
he
argues,
as
limiting
the
government
to
setting
a
decision
of
an
agency
aside
only
if
it
can
show
fraud
or
overreaching.
that
the
entire
history
says
he,
which
we
dispute
of
the
wunderlich
act
shows
that
the
recourse
to
the
courts
for
judicial
review
was
intended
to
be
available
only
to
the
contract
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
actually
written
by
the
general
accounting
office
in
my
opinion.
mr.
irving
jaffe
well
of
course,
the
general
accounting
office
never
had
that
in
mind
as
the
legislative
history
clearly
shows.
mr.
irving
jaffe
the
general
accounting
office
repeatedly
stated
to
the
committee
that
it
was
acting
for
this
legislation
not
only
for
the
benefit
of
the
contractor,
but
because
the
narrow
limited
test
of
fraud
hampered
the
government
and
hampered
the
gao
in
auditing
accounts.
mr.
irving
jaffe
yes.
mr.
irving
jaffe
now
yes
–
now
let
me
comment
on
that
mr.
justice
brennan.
the
original
statute
as
drafted
by
gao
i
believe
included
unless
the
general
accounting
office
or
a
court
found
etcetera,
etcetera.
now
the
interpretation
of
that
clause
in
my
opinion
would
have
equated
the
general
accounting
office
precisely
as
if
it
were
a
court,
it
would
have
had
authority
to
reverse
an
opinion
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
yes.
it
itself
suggested
the
substitute
which
eliminated
the
words
general
accounting
office
or
a
court.
now
of
course
the
statute
speaks
in
terms
of
judicial
review
and
there
was
never
any
question
of
access
to
a
court.
mr.
irving
jaffe
yes
and
the
gao
felt
at
that
time
and
i
submit
to
this
court
that
they
were
correct,
that
the
gao
authority
would
not
be
hampered,
that
is
the
authority
that
they
wanted
to
have
and
that
they
felt
they
always
did
have
before
this
court's
decision
in
the
wunderlich
case.
the
--
that
to
in
auditing
accounts
to
use
a
broader
standard
of
review
and
indeed
they
must.
for
them
to
determine
whether
a
payment
is
or
will
be
illegal
or
unlawful,
or
within
the
contemplation
of
statute
or
law,
they
must
apply
the
applicable
principles
of
law.
in
a
contract
dispute,
those
applicable
principles
and
the
standards
to
be
applied
are
those
set
forth
in
the
wunderlich
act.
so
whether
or
not
they
are
mentioned
when
they
audit
accounts,
when
they
render
an
advance
opinion
in
order
to
determine
whether
it
is
or
will
be
a
lawful
expenditure,
they
must
apply
the
applicable
law,
the
wunderlich
act.
now
the
–-
there
is
no
suggestion
i'm
sure
and
none
have
been
made,
that
the
wunderlich
act
in
any
way
repealed
those
provisions
of
the
law
which
give
to
the
general
accounting
office
the
authority
to
render
an
advance
opinion
to
a
certifying
officer
as
was
the
case
here
or
to
audit
accounts
and
to
disallow
items
which
were
illegally
or
erroneously
paid.
now
in
a
contract
matter
that
must
be
the
standard
of
the
wunderlich
act.
now
i
will
not
dwell
on
the
legislative
history
because
we
believe
that
it
supports
the
view
that
the
government
has
equal
access
to
the
courts
for
the
contract
without
question.
however,
the
legislative
history
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
i
mean
any
of
the
agency,
the
general
accounting
office
or
the
department
of
justice.
i
think
what
we
are
really
speaking
about
is
not
who
is
the
only
person
who
may
speak,
but
who
and
under
what
circumstances
can
the
matter
be
precipitated
into
a
court
review.
now
i
think
that
that
can
occur
in
many
ways.
i
think
the
most
usual
way
would
be
by
failing
to
pay.
now
who
is
going
to
make
that
determination?
perhaps
the
best
answer
is
how
that
determination
has
been
made
and
there
are
many
instances
which
have
occurred
in
the
past
prior
to
this
case,
prior
to
the
(inaudible)
case,
there
are
many
cases
that
mr.
--
that
judge
--
that
judge
davis
of
the
court
of
claims
detailed
in
the
line
of
case.
the
usual
way
is
not
to
pay
and
who
determines
that?
normally
it's
the
general
counsel
of
the
agency,
who
--
and
how
does
that
come
about?
the
angry
trial
attorney
that
we
always
have
him,
the
angry
trial
attorney
who
has
lost
the
case
before
his
board,
who
feels
that
the
board
was
wrong,
that
they
have
no
legal
sense
that
they
are
way
off
base,
complains
to
the
general
counsel.
in
99
cases
out
of
a
100,
he
addresses
(inaudible)
perhaps
even
more,
but
occasionally
the
general
counsel
is
persuaded
and
the
general
counsel
will
block
the
payment.
it
doesn't
go
to
gao
at
all
and
that
precipitates
payment.
occasionally
the
matter
will
be
submitted
to
the
department
of
justice.
somebody
in
the
agency
and
it
has
to
be
someone
high
up
because
we
do
not
accept
communications
from
trial
attorneys
or
lower
stafficial
ones,
there
is
someone
in
the
general
counsel's
office
or
an
assistant
secretary
will
write
to
us
and
say
they
are
disturbed
about
an
opinion
as
did
mason,
as
did
faa,
as
did
several
agencies,
and
the
question
they
asked
us
is
not
to
intervene
in
the
disputes
process,
as
the
petitioner
would
have
you
believe,
the
decision
has
already
been
rendered.
the
disputes
process
is
at
a
close.
the
question
is
if
we
don't
pay
will
you
defend
us?
will
this
withstand
scrutiny?
now
so
far
unfortunately
we
found
that
it
wouldn't
withstand
scrutiny.
all
we
could
find
is
that
if
we
were
the
judges,
we
would
have
decided
differently,
but
that's
no
reason
for
challenging,
as
the
courts
have
frequently
said.
we
haven't
found
one
yet,
although
several
have
been
submitted
to
us,
where
we
thought
we
would
defend
it,
but
that
is
a
method
in
which
it
could
be
done.
sometimes
the
gao
will
come
across
it
either
by
advance
opinion
as
happened
here
or
perhaps
in
a
post
audit.
i
can't
imagine
how
else
at
the
moment,
although
there
maybe
other
ways,
it
would
come
--
the
government
would
have
this
right
of
appeal
which
i
submit
is
a
misnomer.
we're
not
appealing,
we
are
seeking
judicial
review.
we
don't
change
the
opinion,
neither
department
of
justice
did,
the
gao
did
not.
the
only
opinion
before
the
court
is
the
atomic
energy
commission
opinion.
it
is
not
true
to
say
that
they
still
are
restraining
at
the
least
to
pay
this
man,
want
to
go
forward.
they've
assisted
us
in
our
defense.
they
are
yielding,
whether
or
not
they
still
agree
with
their
decision,
they
are
yielding
to
the
possibility
that
the
gao
was
reasonable
or
maybe
right.
mr.
irving
jaffe
it
lost
complete
control
your
honor,
but
i
am
speaking
about
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
that
is
correct.
mr.
irving
jaffe
that
probably
would
have
been
the
end
of
the
matter
but
perhaps
not.
i
should
remind
the
court
of
the
possibility
that
in
this
particular
case,
for
example,
the
comptroller
general
having
written
a
260-page
opinion
might
not
have
ignored
the
matter
had
it
been
paid.
but
he
would
be
powerless
to
do
anything
except
to
send
it
to
the
department
of
justice
for
prosecution,
either
against
the
surety,
against
the
disbursing
officer,
or
perhaps,
which
is
more
likely,
against
the
recipient
of
the
money
as
in
the
contract
we
could
recoup
it
if
we
agree.
mr.
irving
jaffe
very
very
seldom.
i
should
add
here
--
in
this
particular
case,
the
only
real
relief
available
was
not
to
pay.
the
reason
i
say
that
is
because
prior
to
the
completion
of
this
contract,
the
--
all
payments
there
under,
at
least
six
months
before
the
contract
was
completed
while
it
was
being
performed,
that
all
payments
here
under
were
assigned
to
a
bank.
i
therefore
wonder
why
we
speak
so
much
about
the
--
how
contractor
went
out
of
business,
because
of
the
delay
in
payment.
contractor
received,
almost,
that
is
we
paid
the
full
contract
price
after
this
contract.
these
are
the
extras,
the
things
that
have
not
yet
been
determined
that
they
are
entitled
to
payment
on.
and
any
payment
we
decide
or
is
ultimately
decided
that
s
&
e
contractors
are
entitled
to,
we'll
not
go
to
s
&
e
contractors,
but
to
the
bank,
because
when
they
have
assigned
to
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
no,
there
isn't.
i
merely
say
that,
the
failure
hasn't
thrown
him
out
of
business.
mr.
irving
jaffe
well,
except
from
that
fact
alone,
we
don't
and
therefore,
i
think
it
should
not
be
urged
upon
the
court
that
it
did,
except
from
that
fact
alone
that
the
payments
were
assigned
to
a
bank,
who
alone
is
entitled
to
payment.
there
are
many
factors
we
believe
that
put
them
out
of
business
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
what
issue
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
whether
or
not
the
decision
of
the
atomic
energy
commission
is
entitled
to
finality
under
the
standards
of
the
wunderlich
act.
mr.
irving
jaffe
oh!
we
are
challenging
it
on
two
standards
only,
that
either
is
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence
of
the
commission's
allowances
and
in
many
instances
that
it's
erroneous
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
irving
jaffe
under
the
second
section
that
it
cannot
be
final
on
any
part
of
law.
now
the
--
i
had
been
about
to
speak
briefly
about
the
legislative
history.
the
legislative
history
of
course,
as
some
lawyer
in
the
field
once
said
has
a
little
bit
of
everything
for
everybody
and
therefore
it's
little
confusing.
what
we
had
originally
was
a
proposal,
a
wunderlich
act
proposal,
which
would
have
included
the
gao
equally
with
the
courts.
that
was
deleted
and
the
gao
was
taken
out
and
the
word
court
was
taken
out,
but
we
still
speak
of
the
judicial
review.
it
was
quite
clear,
we
say,
from
the
legislative
history.
two
things
were
quite
clear,
that
this
access
to
the
courts
for
judicial
review
under
the
standard
that
they
were
setting
forth
was
available
to
both
parties.
the
reason
that
i
say
that
it
was
aware
is
because
there
were
bills
before
the
congress,
including
one
presented
by
the
american
bar
association
specifically
to
limit
this
judicial
review
to
the
contractors.
the
congress
did
not
accept
any
of
those.
there
were
debates
on
whether
or
not
this
wouldn't
be
equally
available
to
the
government
as
well
as
the
contractor
and
that
the
congress
had
indicated
that
they
thought
it
was.
there
is
no
suggestion
that
it
isn't
available
to
them
and
there
is
certainly
nothing
on
the
face
of
the
act
which
indicates
that
it
is
available
only
to
the
contractor.
the
act
itself
would
seem
to
make
that
clear.
it
says
any
decision
of
the
head
of
the
department
and
any
such
decision
shall
only
have
finality,
if
it
is
not
fraudulent
or
capricious,
etcetera.
now
it
doesn't
say
any
decision
adverse
to
a
contractor
and
i
don't
think
that,
that
should
be
read
in,
particularly
in
the
light
of
the
legislative
history.
it
is
also
strange,
it
seems
to
me,
that
the
argument
should
be
made,
that
the
wunderlich
act
actually
provides
with
two
standards;
one
standard
for
the
contractor
which
covers
this
entire
panoply
of
broadened
standards
and
quite
another
for
the
government.
the
government
is
limited
to
fraud
and
overreaching,
that
is
precisely
what
it
was
the
wunderlich
act
was
seeking
to
overcome.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
that
were
true,
then
the
language
of
the
wunderlich
act,
which
says
that
no
provision
of
any
contract
shall
limit
any
decision
of
a
head
of
an
agency
or
of
a
board
of
contract
appeals
to
fraud,
would
again
have
to
be
interpolated
as
meaning
only
as
against
the
contractor's
complaint,
but
it
could
be
so
limited
as
far
as
the
government
was
concerned.
i
submit
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
language,
nothing
in
the
history,
nothing
in
logic
which
would
call
for
that
view.
i
submit
that
the
government
should
have
and
does
have
equal
access
to
the
courts
to
challenge
the
decisions
of
an
agency
head
or
of
a
board
of
contract
appeal
on
the
basis
set
forth
in
the
wunderlich
act,
that
is
that
the
standards
there
have
not
been
met,
that
no
finality
should
therefore
attach
to
the
decision
and
therefore,
no
payment,
if
one
is
ordered
should
legally
or
lawfully
be
made
under
such
a
decision.
now
the
question
that's
raised,
who
is
the
government?
i
have
answered
in
the
only
way
that
i
can,
the
normal
way
in
which
the
government
gets
a
case
into
court.
now
that
could
be
done
normally
in
one
of
the
three
ways
i
suggested.
i
don't
think
we
need
to
look
for
any
others,
that's
ample
protection
for
the
government.
the
payment
can
be
made
as
the
attorney
general
said
and
we
can
seek
to
recoup
it
in
a
private
suit
of
our
own,
if
it
in
fact
was
erroneous.
now
we
would
have
to
test
in
that
suit
in
the
district
court.
mr.
irving
jaffe
the
disputes
procedure
goes
on
everyday
in
the
week.
the
involvement
of
not
paying
a
decision
of
a
board
of
contract
appeals
rises
very
rarely.
the
way
that
--
frankly,
the
way
in
which
the
government's
access
to
the
courts
has
arisen
in
the
past
most
frequently
has
been
where
a
contractor
submits
several
claims
to
a
board.
the
board
rules
in
the
contractor's
favor
with
respect
to
three
or
four
of
them
and
rules
against
him
with
respect
to
two
or
three
of
them
and
he
is
to
satisfy
with
the
two
or
three,
which
have
been
adverse
to
him
and
he
institutes
a
suit
in
the
court
of
claims
seeking
to
set
aside
the
board's
decision
with
respect
to
those
which
were
adverse
and
we
in
defending
again,
what
is
the
entire
record.
we
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
board
was
correct
in
denying
the
two
or
three
it
did,
but
was
incorrect
in
allowing
two
of
the
four
that
they
had
allowed
because
it
wasn't
supported,
let's
say
by
substantial
evidence
or
was
erroneous
as
a
matter
of
law.
we
have
done
that
in
many,
many
instances
and
we
have
been
successful
and
in
some.
now
that's
merely
another
manner
in
which
the
government
has
asserted
its
right
to
test
a
decision
rendered
under
the
disputes
clause,
under
the
standards
of
the
wunderlich
act.
now
in
this
particular
case,
payment
was
stopped,
that's
happened
before
too
and
then
the
contractor
goes
into
court.
had
we
paid
this
one,
we
would
never
have
been
able
to
recoup
it
because
we
can't
recoup
it
from
a
bank
and
(inaudible).
31
u.s.c.
203
prohibits
that
procedure,
so
that
we
would
have
been
out.
so
in
this
case,
even
if
it
had
wanted
to
pay
and
let
it
go
the
other
way,
the
atomic
energy
commission
would
have
been
ill-advised
to
do
so.
mr.
irving
jaffe
well,
well
we
do.
i
don't
think
i
am
--
to
be
speaking
myself,
paragraph
20
of
the
petition
in
this
very
case
and
then
here,
it
says,
petitioner
assigned
its
rights
to
amounts
to
be
received
under
this
contract
to
the
first
citizens
bank
of
dallas,
texas,
september
12,
1961,
the
contract
was
completed
and
accepted
in
june
of
1962.
mr.
irving
jaffe
against
the
principle
sir?
mr.
irving
jaffe
oh!
no,
not
against
the
principle,
but
he
would
not
have
received
the
money
and
i
don't
know
that
we
would
have
--
i
mean,
it
would
have
been,
well
that's
correct.
mr.
irving
jaffe
we
don't
know
anything
about
the
situation
there,
although
we
did
know
in
1966,
when
the
payment
had
to
be
made.
mr.
irving
jaffe
it
could,
that
could
be
one
way,
but
i
don't
think
that,
that
should
militate
against
seeking
its
day
in
court
in
other
way.
bear
in
mind,
if
you
please
mr.
chief
justice,
if
this
decision
is
not
entitled
to
finality,
the
payment
should
not
be
made.
so
withholding
the
payment
is
not
in
any
sense
a
penalty,
it's
doing
something
we
may
not
be
required
to
do.
mr.
irving
jaffe
under
the
contract
itself.
we
are
only
required
to
make
certain
payments
under
the
contract.
it's
the
same
as
any
private
dispute,
where
one
of
the
parties
of
the
contract
says
i
don't
owe
you
this
money
and
the
other
says
you
do.
now
this
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
oh!
it
definitely
cannot
be
a
breach
of
contract
because
if
it
were,
then
the
holding
that
as
a
breach
would
be
holding
contrary
to
the
terms
of
the
wunderlich
act.
mr.
irving
jaffe
and
for
the
terms
of
this
contract,
which
tried
here.
mr.
irving
jaffe
he
really
doesn't
have
three
tiers
to
overcome.
all
he
has,
if
it
please
you
mr.
justice
blackmun
--
first,
the
general
accounting
office
is
never
a
threat
to
the
contractor.
he
needn't
wait
one
moment
for
the
general
accounting
office
to
have
or
to
consider
the
advance
opinion
or
any
advance
request
from
any
disbursing
or
certifying
officer.
he
can
go
into
court
immediately
he
hears
that
the
general
accounting
office's
views
has
been
solicited.
so
the
general
accounting
office
provides
no
tier
to
him
at
all.
it
is
one
mean
for
the
government
to
be
aware
that
there
may
be
an
illegal
payment
about
to
made
or
if
it
is
made
to
recoup
it.
that's
the
manner
in
which
the
general
accounting
office
entered
the
picture
but
it's
not
a
tier
of
review
as
such.
now,
the
department
of
justice
comes
in
only
if
an
agency
should
decide
to
ask
the
department
first,
will
you
defend
us
or
in
this
case
for
example,
where
the
comptroller
general
has
issued
an
opinion
in
which
he
says
that
this
would
be
an
invalid
payment,
the
agent
--
the
head
of
the
department
could
come
in
and
say
to
us,
do
i
have
to
listen
to
the
comptroller
general?
and
we
could
as
we
have
as
recently
as
1969,
told
the
agencies
your
accountable
officers
need
not
hear
to
the
comptroller
general.
we
think
you
can
make
the
payment,
and
we
so
direct
you.
so
that
--
i
don't
know
to
what
extent
these
tiers
are
review,
really
are
administrative
hurdles.
all
it
is
really
is,
do
we
have
a
basis
for
defending
a
suit
or
for
prosecuting
a
suit,
and
neither
of
them
do
i
think
the
court
should
assume
that
the
contractor
is
entitled
to
money,
any
money
or
any
payment
until
the
court
has
had
opportunity
to
scrutinize
that
decision
under
the
standards
of
the
wunderlich
act.
until
then,
it
is
not
a
order
or
a
decision
in
types
of
the
finality
which
requires
any
payment.
mr.
irving
jaffe
i
think
that
that's
the
natural
consequence
of
the
wunderlich
act
and
the
terms
of
the
contract
would
require
i.
mr.
irving
jaffe
yes
sir
he
is.
mr.
irving
jaffe
we
can't
avoid
he
is
looking
at,
either
before
or
after,
and
in
either
event
there
will
be
a
suit
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
i
am
not
authorized
to
comment
on
that.
mr.
irving
jaffe
yes
sir.
mr.
irving
jaffe
it
is.
mr.
irving
jaffe
no,
sir
he
is
not.
mr.
irving
jaffe
correct,
except
for
one
provision,
31
u.s.c.
74
and
31
u.s.c.
82d,
give
to
the
comptroller
general
on
request,
the
right
to
render
advance
opinions
which
was
precisely
what
was
done
here.
so
that
he
does
come
into
it
in
a
pre-audit
system,
if
an
executive
branch
officer
that
is
the
disbursing
officer
or
a
certifying
officer
asked
him
for
an
advanced
opinion
and
that
was
what
was
done
here.
mr.
irving
jaffe
and
that's
advisory.
mr.
irving
jaffe
well,
he
becomes
a
referee
with
punch
because
his
decision
is
binding
on
the
agency.
