mr.

justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
your
remark
you
have
just
made,
your
explanation
of
why
this
issue
arises
only
in
1971?
it
seems
to
me
it
is
a
late
date
for
it
to
arise.
justice
harry

blackmun
for,
so
the
wunderlich
act
is
what
20
years
old?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
case
is
20
years
ago?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
creyke,
let
me
follow
through
on
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
justice
brennan’s
questions
because
i
am
not
sure
that
you
proffered
full
import
of
it.
i
think
it
is
his
position
that
at
all
times
the
government
could
appeal
on
the
ground
of
fraud,
at
all
times
prior
to
one
that
it
elected
any
time.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
the
next
step
is
that
by
putting
in
language
of
fraud
into
the
contract
that
this
didn't
disturb
that
rule
and
by
putting
in
other
grounds
for
appeal,
the
implication
is
that
the
government
can
appeal
with
respect
to
all
those
other
grounds
as
well
and
what
i
would
like
to
get
is
your
answer
to
that
suggestion?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
jaffe,
i
am
still
bothered
i
think
by
your
answer
to
justice
douglas'
question
as
to
who
is
the
government.
what
comes
to
me
out
of
your
explanation
is
that
this
contractor
has
three
tiers
to
overcome,
the
agency,
the
comptroller
general
and
the
attorney
general?
