did
the

participate
in
any
way
on
the
court
of

case?
chief

warren
e.

very
well
mr.

mr.

chief

but
you

is
it
not?
chief

where
would

amplificated
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
now
clarify
little
bit,
if
i
may
mr.
jaffe.
suppose
this
advice
of
the
comptroller
general,
the
advice
not
to
pay
had
been
disregarded.
suppose
the
atomic
energy
commission
simply
said,
in
effect,
we
have
confidence
in
our
conclusion
and
paid
the
money.
then
the
comptroller
general
might
assume
for
the
moment,
if
you
recommended
to
suit
for
over
payment.
the
ultimate
decision
on
that
would
be
made
where?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
department
of
justice
would
then
become
really
the
--
for
all
practical
purposes
but
final
reviewing
authority
would
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
happens?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
happens
if
not
frequently
it
is
rather
uncommon
occurrence.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
jaffe,
we
assume
that
the
comptroller
general
was
correct
on
all
his
points,
what
is
the
dollar
difference
between
his
positions,
and
if
i
can
put
it
in
that
rough
way,
and
the
amount
that
the
atomic
energy
commission
was
prepared
to
pay
out.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
must
be
known
generally,
are
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
the
resolution
of
the
basic
problem
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
appreciation.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
to
be
subject
to
the
same
sequence
of
events?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
differently.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
he
make
any
specific
findings
with
respect
to
any
portion
of
the
comptroller
general’s
report?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
see
any
ambiguity
mr.
jaffe
or
lack
of
clarity
between
the
main
body
of
section
321
and
that
proviso?
do
they
meet
end
to
end
or
is
there
a
gap
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
but
then
there
is
a
catch
all
or
capricious
or
arbitrary
or
grossly,
so
grossly
erroneous
as
to
imply
bad
faith.
some
critics
of
the
proviso
have
suggested
that
this
was
giving
one
hand
and
taking
away
with
the
other.
it
is
just
not
clear
frankly
to
me
that
the
things
could
be
--
.
chief

e.

very
well.
mr.

thank

the

we'll
here
arguments
next
in

70-88,

mr.

you
may
proceed
whenever
you're

chief

warren
e.

the
claimant
has
and
if
they
receive
some
money,
will
they
receive
interest
from
the
time
when
it
was
due?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
court
of
claims
cannot
make
an
allowance
of
interest
as
such,
can
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
would
take
special
legislation
to
treat
that
aspect
of
the
problem,
i
imagine?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
historically
i
understand
there
have
been
occasions
where
payments
were
made
not
withstanding
the
opposition
of
the
comptroller
general,
but
that
was
where
the
attorney
general
took
the
opposite
position?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
creyke,
i
am
not
sure
i
follow
those
hypothetical
situations
as
they
evolved
in
this
colloquy,
but
if
the
comptroller
general
had
taken
no
position
and
if
the
atomic
energy
commission
had
approved
the
payment,
but
it's
dispersing
officer
refused
to
pay
the
atomic
energy
commission
might
solve
that
by
just
getting
a
new
dispersing
officer
might
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
he
has
no
authority
to
interpose
himself
or
a
legal
authority
to
interpose
himself
between
the
decision
of
the
commission
and
a
contractor?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
creyke.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
creyke,
since
you've
answered
that
last
question
after
you
revealed
and
we'll
give
you
the
three
minutes
you
were
trying
to
save
and
we'll
enlarge
you
accordingly
mr.
jaffe.
mr.
jaffe?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
are
going
to
the
practical
matters
that
we
have
brought
in
the
colloquially.
if
the
general
accounting
office
had
never
got
into
this
situation
at
all,
what
would
the
atomic
energy
commission
have
done
at
the
conclusion
of
its
funds?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
we
to
assume
that
they
would
have
paid
the
contractor?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
excuse
me
my
interrupting
you.
in
this
case
let
me
pose
the
question
mr.
justice
douglas
put.
right
at
that
stage
at
this
problem
when
you
say
the
government,
you
mean
what
entity,
what
part
of
the
government?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn't
that
chiefly
mr.
mr.
jaffe,
because
once
it
wanted
the
litigation,
the
atomic
energy
commission
would
have
lost
the
control.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
attorney
general
has
the
sole
control
once
the
litigation
has
started.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
the
atomic
energy
commission
had
just
decided
to
ignore
the
comptroller
general
and
pay
the
money
out
that
would
in
all
probability
had
been
the
end
of
the
matter,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
doesn't
happen
very
often,
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(voice

rule
about
having
a
businessman
after
the
proceeds
of
the
contract
with
the
government
is
pledged
as
collateral
for
bank,
is
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but,
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
that
one
way
or
the
other
really,
have
we?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
have
knowing
on
this
record,
of
course,
whether
the
bank
kept
all
of
this
or
whether
they
kept
half
of
it
or
some
other
part,
do
we?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
doesn't
prevent
your
recovery,
your
recoupment
against
that
principle.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
don't
know
anything
about
that,
do
we?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
when
you
say
the
government
must
have
its
day
in
court,
it
certainly
has
a
day
in
court
by
the
recoupment
route,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
jaffe.
chief
justice
warren
e.

the
comptroller
general's
function
is
essentially
a
post
audit
function,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
is
not
part
of
the
discretionary
decision

during
the
evolution
of

chief

e.

he
is
strictly
an
auditor.
chief

warren
e.

that's
advisory
only.
chief

warren
e.

now
if
dispute,
disagreement,
difference
in
position
evolves
between
the
contracting
agency
and
the
comptroller

the
attorney

really
becomes
the

does
he
not?
chief
