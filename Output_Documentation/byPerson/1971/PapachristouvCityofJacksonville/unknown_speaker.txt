unknown
speaker
in
your
brief
you
talked
about
the
ordinance
and
for
reasons
that
i
think
and
i
understand
also
the
state
statute,
very
similar
one
which
is
assimilated
--
unknown
speaker
might
have
--
unknown
speaker
so
it
is
common
ground
now
if
the
--
what
the
issue
here
is
the
ordinance.
unknown
speaker
yes.
i
have
one
question.
one
of
the
petitioners
here
is
brown.
unknown
speaker
was
brown
loitering?
unknown
speaker
well,
my
impression
is
that
perhaps
you
could
talk
about
it
later
is
that
the
brown
situation
is
certainly
different
from
those
of
the
others.
unknown
speaker
well,
putting
it
another
way
i
think
that
brown
were
here
alone,
his
posture
would
be
much
more
difficult
comparatively.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
when
was
it
adopted?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
was
the
whole
library.
unknown
speaker
i
believe
it
was
like
this
in
1597
or
something
--
.
unknown
speaker
of
course
it
was
recently
amended,
was
it
not?
modernized
by
eliminating
the
word
jiggly
(ph)?
unknown
speaker
but
it
left
rogues
and
vagabonds
in.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
this
vagrancy?
unknown
speaker
how
about
persons
able
to
work
who
are
actually
living
upon
the
earnings
of
their
wives?
unknown
speaker
not
very
vague.
unknown
speaker
or
is
it
only
--
it
is
far
from
a
dead
letter
though?
unknown
speaker
that
i
read
somewhere
in
these
papers,
that
there
are
hundreds
of
arrests
under
the
statute,
under
this
ordinance
every
year,
are
they
not?
unknown
speaker
but
under
various
statutes
and
ordinance?
unknown
speaker
and
under
this
particular
ordinance
which
you
tell
us
is
so
arcade
and
acknowledged,
it
seems
to
be
a
very
actively
utilized
legislation?
unknown
speaker
for
there
is
a
class
b
offense,
what
is
the
maximum,
i
see
it
now
90
days
and
$500.00?
unknown
speaker
$450?
unknown
speaker
are
you
asking
us
to
strike
it
down
without
more
or
just
strike
it
down
as
it
would
apply
to
the
civil
cases?
unknown
speaker
so
under
--
no
one
was
convicted
of
being
a
rogue
or
vagabond?
unknown
speaker
and
yet
you
want
us
to
strike
that?
unknown
speaker
how
can
--
how
do
we
suppose
to
use
that
?
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
what
you
suggest
is
in
effect
of
charge
with
every
one
of
these
things?
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
reference
in
the
ordinance
that
it
was
a
prowling
by
auto?
unknown
speaker
which
means
that
everything
that
is
direct,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
jimmy
lee
smith
and
that
according
to
the
state,
would
charge
vagrancy
case
vagabond.
unknown
speaker
now,
what
about
those
who
are
charged
vagrancy
-
common
thief,
there
is
no
common
thief
with
the
--
unknown
speaker
and
how
about
the
loitering,
is
that
okay?
unknown
speaker
but
what
is
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
you
now
insisted
that
was
a
resit
of
a
statute
--
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
what
--
pardon?
unknown
speaker
yes.
but
you
are
not
telling
us
that
somebody
who
has
been
convicted
and
served
whatever
his
punishment
was,
suppose
twice
for
a
theft
then
could
be
arrested
as
a
common
thief
and
--
on
that
charge,
are
you?
unknown
speaker
let
us
say
he
has
been
convicted
and
sentenced
for
five
years
imprisonment
that
he
served
once
for
theft
and
then
he
was
guilty
of
theft
again
and
serves
his
sentence
for
about
another
five
years
then
at
anytime
he
walks
around
jacksonville
he
could
be
--
could
he
be
arrested
as
a
common
thief
and
charged
with
it
and
sent
to
prison
again?
unknown
speaker
everyday,
could
he
be
arrested?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
it
was
reached
in
a
recent
opinion.
unknown
speaker
well,
actually
the
united
states
constitution
is
--
unknown
speaker
that
it
was
written
in
the
18th
century.
unknown
speaker
what
your
legislature
is
doing
is
get
rid
of
this
fact?
unknown
speaker
no.
i
am
just
a
little
puzzled.
you
suggest
that
the
florida
legislation,
you
have
seen
some
of
these
in
other
cases
argued
for
the
last
couple
of
weeks,
currently
there
is
some
very
active
working
under
the
criminal
code.
but
that
may
do
something
with
this
provision
of
the
statute
does
not
mean
necessarily
that
jacksonville,
is
going
to
(inaudible)
with
the
ordinance
code.
what
we
have
recoursed
is
only
the
ordinance,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
how
about
this
case,
where
does
this
case
come
from
to
us?
unknown
speaker
our
writ
should
have
run
to
the
circuit
court?
unknown
speaker
the
circuit
court
did
pass
on
their
merits?
unknown
speaker
circuit
court?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
they
reached
the
constitutional
question?
unknown
speaker
so
our
writ
should
have
run
to
them?
unknown
speaker
you
are
not
suggesting
that
a
statute
would
say
that
so
be
a
crime
to
commit
act,
injuries
to
the
public
welfare
--
unknown
speaker
why
is
that?
that
would
be
just
very
good.
unknown
speaker
and
you
don't
think
that
suffered.
unknown
speaker
in
total.
unknown
speaker
that
is
all
we
are
being
asked
to
do.
unknown
speaker
do
you
suggest
we
rewrite
it?
unknown
speaker
that
case
is
cited
in
your
brief?
unknown
speaker
on
the
remand
of
johnson.
unknown
speaker
in
your
brief
or
reply
brief?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
and
that
is
in
johnson?
unknown
speaker
216
so.
