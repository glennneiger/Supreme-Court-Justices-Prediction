mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
conviction
of
eight
persons
for
vagrancy
in
the
municipal
court
of
the
city
of
jacksonville,
florida
under
the
jacksonville
vagrancy
ordinance.
petitioners
and
the
trial
court
and
through
the
florida
appellant
system
contended
that
the
ordinance
upon
which
they
were
convicted
was
facially
invalid
and
they
are
now
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
first
district
court
of
appeals,
state
of
florida
where
they
began
off
with
the
same
contentions.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
right.
i
was
just
going
to
mention
that
of
--
we
treated
that
on
the
possibility
that
the
city
might
have
kept
following
back
after
our
brief
was
filed
on
the
state
statute
that
--
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
they
have
not
done
so
and
i
do
not
think
the
state’s
statute
is
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
they
are
very
similar
so
that
i
do
not
think
it
makes
much
different
but
there
is
no
question
that
the
statute
is
not
involved
now.
the
only
contention
that
we
do
offer
is
that
the
city
ordinance
is
on
its
face
unconstitutional
and
invalid.
we
contend
at
the
same
time
that
the
whole
ordinance
is
unconstitutional.
we
argue
that
the
petitioners
in
this
case
were
convicted
generally
of
vagrancy
at
least
cannot
be
said
this
with
regard
to
seven
of
them
that
they
were
convicted
under
any
specific
sub-part
of
the
ordinance
in
question
and
that
as
a
result
under
this
court’s
previous
rulings
that
they
are
able
to
show
that
any
part
of
the
general
legislation
is
unconstitutional
then
they
are
entitled
to
a
reversal
of
the
acquittal.
because
our
attack
is
limited
to
the
facial
validity
of
the
ordinance,
i
do
not
propose
to
go
into
the
statements
of
facts
that
were
set
out
by
stipulation
with
the
city
in
the
petitioners’
brief
unless
there
is
some
question
about
one
particular
case
from
any
member
of
court.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
yes
sir.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
the
evidence
was
that
brown
came
out
of
a
hotel
which
was
suppose
to
be
of
low
repute
and
that
as
he
walked
out
of
the
hotel
he
was
moving
and
it
was
late
at
night
and
then
he
had
something
that
resembled
money
in
his
hands
and
that
two
police
officers
who
were
there
were
suspicious
of
him
and
they
called
--
they
then
called
him
over
as
he
walked
down
the
street
unless
his
movement
down
the
street
could
be
considered
loitering,
i
do
not
know
that
there
would
be
any
evidence
of
loitering
in
the
case.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
brown
situation
is
added
to
round
off
the
package
of
these
cases
because
we
assume
that
the
city
would
contend
that
there
were
circumstances
in
which
something
like
vagrancy
statute
and
ordinance
would
be
required
through
offenders
or
hardcore
criminal
and
we
did
want
to
bring
in
instance
of
at
least
that
sort
of
alleged
situation
before
the
court.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
i
think
that
if
brown
were
here
alone
his
case
would
not
be
nearly
so
appealing
as
the
other
people,
some
of
them
who
suffered
really
blatant
depression
though.
i
do
not
think
however
that
the
grossness
of
brown’s
character
and
his
testimony
against
him
would
really
affect
the
attack
on
the
facial
validity
of
the
ordinance.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
yes
sir.
narcotics
charge
was
brought
against
him,
was
subsequently
dismissed
because
in
the
code
of
proper
jurisdiction
for
that
charge
it
was
found
that
the
narcotics
had
been
found
by
reason
of
an
unreasonable
search
because
it
was
being
stopped
from
the
occasional
questioning.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
it
goes
back
farther
then
the
earlier
colonial
ordinances
mr.
chief
justice,
it
is
very
strikingly
similar
to
an
ordinance
of
1597
that
brought
together
the
old
english
legislation
up
to
that
date
of
the
statute
of
elizabeth.
one
of
the
commentators
in
fact
pointed
out
the
striking
similarity
between
this
legislation
and
that.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
i
have
not
been
able
to
ascertain
that.
i
tried
to
find
out
but
jacksonville
like
a
lot
of
small
towns
had
a
devastating
fire
at
one
time
that
burned
down
the
courthouse.
i
--
the
own
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
i
have
not
been
able
to
find
it.
i
have
checked
with
the
city
attorney’s
office
and
went
back
and
reviewed
all
available
records,
i
could
find
suggestions
to
it
and
can
say
that
it
came
into
existence
in
the
early
part
of
the
century.
but
precisely
when,
we
were
just
able
to
ascertain.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
yes
sir.
that
is
correct.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
and
considerably
more
for.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
we
contend
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
vagrancy
as
prowling
by
auto,
really
a
--
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
it
does
not
make
any
difference.
in
florida,
i
had
mentioned
the
president
of
the
united
states
in
the
city
of
jacksonville
could
be
a
vagrant
if
assuming
that
there
is
any
ascertainable
statute
in
this
ordinance
under
certain
circumstances
--
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
that
goes
to
our
contention
that
the
ordinance
is
unconstitutionally
vague.
and
more
than
that
--
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
well,
who
was
able
to
work
and
what
is
officially
living
on
the
earnings
of
one’s
wives
and
minor
children?
that
is
what
we
contend,
we
further
contend
that
that
invades
restricted
area
of
privacy
that
the
state
is
not
entitled
to
hold.
when
all
this
said
and
done,
it
is
difficult
to
understand
why
the
vagrancy
concept
is
persistent
for
as
long
as
it
had
any
way
of
the
--
the
plain
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
it
was
born
in
the
peculiar
socio-economic
needs
of
feudal
england
and
elizabethan
england
broadened
over
a
period
of
some
200
or
300
years
all
going
back
400
or
500
years
before
now
and
really
has
no
application
to
the
current
needs
of
our
society
and
more
than
is
offensive
in
many
of
our
settled
and
fundamental
notions
of
democracy
and
further
than
that
it
has
been
criticized
almost
universally
by
the
commentators
and
in
recent
years
by
the
state
courts
and
lower
federal
courts
in
that
occasions
considering
on
the
merits.
and
yet,
even
though
the
florida
ordinance
and
the
jacksonville’s
--
the
florida
statute
and
jacksonville
ordinance
which
is
really
derived
from
the
florida
statute
are
probably
the
most
arcades
of
all
of
the
state
statutes,
the
florida
system
has
tenaciously
functional
--
.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
not
at
all.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
in
the
city
of
jacksonville
alone
in
the
first
ten
months
of
1971
there
had
been
986
arrests.
i
do
not
know
how
many
had
been
over
the
state
and
the
last
figures
published
by
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation,
the
last
crime
statistics
for
the
nation
as
a
whole
and
statistics
covering
approximately
a
hundred
and
forty
million
people,
there
were
over
a
hundred
and
six
thousands
arrests,
that
was
in
1959.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
and
it
--
across
the
country,
yes
sir.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
very
aggressively
utilized.
not
only
are
there
arrests,
there
are
also
substantial
conviction
with
jail
time
imposed.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
at
the
time
of
these
cases,
since
then
in
order
to
avoid
the
fifth
circuit’s
ruling
with
its
regard
to
the
right
of
counsel
and
petty
offenses
which
was
before
the
court.
on
monday,
it
is
the
maximum
if
they
are
not
limited
to
75
days
with
no
right
of
aggregation
though,
offense
is,
flat
75
day
maximum.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
yes
sir.
that
was
because
of
somewhat
probably
dictum
in
fifth
circuit
cases
saying
that
a
$500.00
fine
activated
the
right
to
counsel.
we
contend
that
the
legislation
is
invalid
on
several
constitutional
basis,
the
first
one
and
the
easiest
one
is
--
that
it
is
void
for
vagueness.
this
court,
going
back
as
far
as
50
years
ago
in
connally
versus
general
construction
company
said
that
legislation
required
that
a
normal
and
ordinary
person
guesses
to
its
meaning
and
about
which
was
reasonable
--
might
differ
was
unconstitutionality
vague.
it
would
seem
to
us
that
the
requirement
that
there
be
definiteness
in
a
criminal
statute
or
a
statute
of
this
sort,
really
is
necessary
for
basically
three
functions.
one,
to
provide
notice
to
affected
persons,
two,
to
provide
ascertainable
standards
of
enforcement
for
the
people
who
are
charged
with
enforcement
and,
three,
to
provide
a
breathing
space
or
to
eliminate
chill
with
people
who
would
wish
to
exercise
preferred
rights
or
constitutionally
guaranteed
rights.
the
first
question,
that
is
what
this
legislation
provides
notice,
almost
answers
itself.
it
is
really
impossible
to
read
the
legislation
and
be
able
to
put
any
definite
meaning
on
virtually
anyone
of
the
various
subparts.
if
you
begin
with
the
initial
provision
of
rogues,
i
do
not
know
who
could
define
what
a
rogue
is
and
if
he
moves
through
and
ends
with
the
provision
that
mr.
justice
brennan
spoke
up
dealing
with
able
bodied
people
who
habitually
live
on
the
earnings
of
their
wives
or
minor
children,
i
do
not
know
that
anybody
can
put
any
precise
definition
on
that
language.
certainly
it
is
clear
that
the
ordinance
is
a
good
deal,
more
vague
and
elusive
than
the
ordinance
or
the
statute
that
was
struck
down
some
30
or
40
years
ago
by
this
court
in
lanzetta
versus
new
jersey
dealing
with
people
who
associate
themselves
with
gangs
of
more
than
three
or
more
persons.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
we
are
asking
you
to
strike
it
down
independently
of
the
applications
in
these
cases.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
no
sir.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
we
contend
--
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
well,
in
two
ways,
in
the
beginning
these
people
were
charged
flatly
with
vagrancy.
it
is
our
contention
there
is
language
which
appears
on
the
docket
entry
which
forms
the
charging
instrument
in
the
municipal
court
--
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
no.
we
say
that
that
does
not
limit
it.
that
for
example
as
mr.
justice
marshall
pointed
out,
there
are
some
of
these
people
who
were
charged
with
vagrancy
-
prowling
by
auto.
we
say
that
that
is
simply
an
explanatory
statement
by
the
arresting
police
officer
regarded
as
surplus
by
the
court.
it
is
not
legally
limiting
to
the
charge
at
all.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
that
is
right.
for
which
reason,
we
contend
that
they
were
in
effect
charged
with
vagrancy
generally
that
--
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
correct.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
very
definitely.
we
contend
that
no
one
could
ever
know
what
is
to
be
prescribed
by
this
ordinance.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
ordinarily,
he
is
not.
there
is
a
specifically
--
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
presumably
he
could
be.
i
am
not
able
to
answer
–
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
i
would
say
so
because
he
has
no
way
of
knowing
before
he
gets
himself
in
that
state,
what
a
common
drunkard
is
and
whether
he
is
going
to
be
subject
to
the
ordinance,
if
he
puts
himself
in
that
position.
yet
--
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
jimmy
lee
smith
is
the
only
one
that
is
not
in
the
category
that
i
spoke
of.
he
is
charged
with
something
that
is
specifically
according
to
the
ordinance.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
no
sir.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
no
sir.
one
man
is
charged
with
disorderly
loitering
on
the
street
and
there
is
something
in
there
that
relates
to
disorderly
people.
but
there
is
nothing
on
loitering
--
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
i
do
not
know.
it
has
no
basis
in
the
ordinance
and
that
is
why
we
contend
that
it
really
simply,
if
it
was
legally
limiting
in
any
way
then
our
motion
to
dismiss
at
the
prowl
would
have
been
acquired
and
been
granted.
i
will
say
this.
at
the
time
the
legislation
was
begun,
there
was
a
category
florida
law
known
as
common
thief
which
persisted
up
until
the
early
part
of
the
century
providing
that
anybody
who
had
can
convict
of
theft
constituting
a
felony
for
two
times
or
more
became
a
common
thief
and
was
subject
to
20
years
of
imprisonment.
that
was
in
existence
at
the
time
this
legislation
was
passed
and
this
legislation
do
not
refer
to
--
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
crude
one
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
a
crude
one.
crude
resit
of
the
statute.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
and
at
that
time
that
was
the
case.
yes,
if
you
--
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
that
was
a
state
statute,
any
time
he
walked
around
the
state
of
florida.
that
statute
is
no
longer
in
effect
but
we
have
the
same
thing
being
done
in
a
municipal
ordinance
in
this
instance.
he
could
only
be
sent
to
jail
for
75
days
but
if
he
has
been
guilty
of
some
sort
of
thief
whether
theft
whether
he
has
been
convicted
of
it
or
not,
it
might
be
contended
that
he
was
in
the
thieves
calender
--
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
my
point
is
that
we
do
not
know
what
common
thief
is,
some
or
two
of
these
individuals
were
charged
of
being
common
thieves.
and
if
that
has
no
reference
to
the
ordinance,
the
ordinance
does
refer
to
thieves
and
the
ordinance
would
have
the
effect
that
you
have
spoken
of
for
people
who
might
be
considered
within
the
category
of
thieves
whatever
that
is.
the
vagrancy
is
a
continuing
offense
if
somebody
had
committed
a
theft
or
has
been
convicted
of
a
theft
for
two
or
three,
whether
--
however
long
ago
it
had
been
or
however
minor
it
has
been
or
however
much
more
he
has
been
convicted
of
it,
he
is
subject
to
continuing
incarceration.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
he
cannot
walk
the
street
of
jacksonville
without
being
subject
to
arrest.
if
this
legislation
was
out.
he
can
serve
75
days
and
immediately
on
release
and
subject
to
an
arrest.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
the
more
confirmed
it
is.
yes
sir.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
i
am
not
able
to
say,
mr.
chief
justice.
nobody
knows,
that
is
precisely
--
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
no.
that
is
the
point.
there
is
no
reference
to
common
in
this
ordinance,
this
legislation.
in
subprior
legislation
that
was
in
inexistence
--
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
that
is
true.
i
am
speaking
with
regard
to
thieves.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
that
is
true.
but
there,
there
was
a
legislative
definition
of
what
common
law
is.
i
do
not
know
--
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
we
can
only
suppose.
that
is
a
good
point.
with
regard
to
the
vagueness
point,
we
think
that
the
merit
was
capsulized
very
well
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
winters
versus
new
york
in
1940
something.
he
there
pointed
out
that
this
type
of
legislation
falls
in
the
unique
category
that
--
it
is
perfectly
designed
to
be
vague,
purposely
designed
to
be
open,
and
it
is
significance
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
did
that
and
it
is
further
significant
that
he
did
it
in
the
circumstances
in
which
he
did
because
he
was
there
dissenting
from
a
majority
holding
that
legislation
was
unconstitutionally
vague
and
he
had
catalogued
the
reasons
why
the
court
should
be
very
hesitant
to
declare
a
legislation
unconstitutionally
vague
and
he
specified
as
an
exception
the
area
of
vagrancy
in
which
he
said
within
a
unique
category,
by
itself
it
was
egregiously
bad.
in
addition
to
the
problem
of
lack
of
notice
to
affected
persons
we
also
have
a
problem
that
is
presented
by
lack
of
some
sort
of
enforcement
standards.
there
is
no
way.
and
the
police
officer
or
jury
and
municipal
judge
or
anybody
else
could
know
what
is
intended
at.
and
this
in
and
of
itself
and
by
--
stand
unless
a
discriminatory
enforcement
especially
when
we
have
legislation
of
the
ultimate
--
sort
of
that
we
have
here
that
can
be
directed
and
applied
to
unconventional
or
unpopular
or
unestablished
people
of
the
sort
--
quite
of
these
anyway
from
people
who
are
or
not
willing
to
be
broadminded
than
others.
apparently
the
legislation,
because
of
its
breadth
and
broadness,
necessarily
must
restrict
people.
in
the
attempted
exercise
and
the
desired
exercise,
the
rights
that
are
preserved
to
them
without
question
about
the
constitution,
certainly
the
right
of
travel
is
drawn
into
question
by
the
provision
against
wandering
from
place
to
place
for
example.
and
we
have
enumerated
others
in
our
brief
with
the
suggestion
how
they
might
be
similarly
effective.
apart
from
that
contention,
we
also
contend
under
a
broad
grouping
that
we
called
abuse
of
police
power
that
the
ordinance
is
constitutionally
invalid
in
other
respects.
we
contend
first
that
insofar
as
it
relates
to
people
who
are
in
the
category
of
mr.
justice
brennan
spoke
off
living
on
the
earnings
of
their
wives
and
so
on
that
it
invades
the
zone
of
privacy
that
was
thought
to
be
secured
by
griswold
versus
connecticut.
further
even
in
the
part
of
the
ordinance
which
deals
with
thieves
and
gamblers
and
what
have
you
which
might
be
outside
that
area,
the
legislation
is
still
overbroad
because
of
the
completeness
of
its
application.
the
point
that
mr.
justice
stewart
was
speaking
of
where
it
can
be
applied
recurrently
over
and
over
again
against
one
individual,
so
that
he
becomes
permanently
an
outcast
and
permanently
subject
to
incarceration.
in
this
regard,
it
is
significant
to
note
that
the
only
justification
offered
for
that
kind
of
breadth
and
scope
by
the
city
of
jacksonville
its
prime
control
and
it
is
significant
that
they
are
ample
prime
control
methods
available
to
the
city
of
jacksonville
or
the
state
of
florida
that
can
accomplish
the
same
purposes
that
this
legislation
can
accomplish
without
nearly
the
oppression
to
human
and
individual
rights.
we
say
also
as
a
third
major
point
and
related
to
the
abuse
of
police
power,
that
really,
the
legislation
is
no
more
than
a
legislative
declaration
that
some
people
are
suspicious
per
se,
that
some
people
are
tending
the
crime
per
se
and
if
they
must
be
suppressed
at
the
outset,
he
independently
of
any
act
or
an
issue
on
that
part.
this
is
actually
borne
out
by
the
social
history
of
the
legislation
by
the
contention
that
is
made
by
the
city
expressed
in
its
brief
and
by
the
history
of
application
well
documented
by
boards
such
as
the
president’s
commission
on
law
enforcement
and
the
american
bar
association’s
foundation
for
criminal
justice
which
have
all
found
that
the
legislation
is
used
primarily
for
the
arrest
of
people
on
suspicion
only
when
police
officers
require
or
make
ways
and
they
cannot
find
anything
else
to
use
--
its
grounds
for
an
arrest.
but
we
say
that
this
pattern
in
tradition
of
use,
has
become
inevitable
part
of
the
statute
and
in
fact,
it
has
resulted
because
it
was
built
into
the
statutes
or
into
the
ordinance
in
the
first
the
instance
and
it
would
only
be
inevitable
result
--
and
will
continue
unless
the
legislation
is
now
struck
down.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
time.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
i
would
like
first
to
respond
to
some
of
the
explicit
statements
made
by
mr.
austin.
the
contention
that
we
are
out
of
court
because
the
writ
has
been
misdirected
that
we
submit
is
no
more
than
a
cripple
--
it
is
not
entitled
to
any
standing.
we
treated
this
question
at
some
length
in
our
reply
brief.
the
matter
was
also
litigated
in
connection
with
the
application
for
a
writ
of
certiorari.
if
in
fact
the
city
is
correct
that
the
writ
was
misdirected,
the
simple
answer
would
be
for
the
review
that
this
court
makes
to
be
at
the
circuit
court
order
which
can
well
be
done
and
that
that
is
the
proper
remedy
in
connection
with
the
application
for
certiorari.
we
responded
to
the
city's
response
by
saying
that
we
would
be
very
pleased
for
the
writ
to
be
directed
to
the
circuit
court
instead
of
to
the
first
district
if
that
was
the
appropriate
choice.
we
think
that
it
makes
a
difference
with
--
it
is
a
difference
without
a
distinction
from
purposes
of
these
proceedings.
i
might
have
lost
to
understand
the
city's
recurrent
citation
of
the
headley
versus
selkowitz
language
by
the
florida
supreme
court
that
the
vagrancy
statute
is
not
be
used
very
liberally
by
florida
law
enforcement
officers.
i
do
not
see
how
that
provides
any
comfort
to
the
city.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
no
more
than
or
no
less
than
an
expressed
statement
that
law
enforcers,
that
law
enforcement
officers
are
not
to
make
any
even
handed
application
of
the
statute
but
that
they
are
given
license
and
freedom
to
decide
for
themselves
what
the
standards
of
arrest
are
going
to
be
which
to
us
seems
to
point
out
the
very
vise
of
the
statute
was
complained
about.
mr.
austin
says
that
it
was
not
intended
to
apply
just
to
poor
people
and
in
its
application
is
not
in
that
effect.
i
submit
that
while
it
may
not
have
been
--
may
not
be
applied
to
poor
people
alone
that
by
and
large
the
application
is
to
people
who
are
or
small
people
who
are
in
no
position
to
protest
or
make
the
protest
heard.
the
keeper
of
the
largest
gambling
place
in
florida
i
believe
is
the
president
of
race
track,
i
never
known
him
to
be
arrested
for
vagrancy
as
a
keeper
of
a
gambling
place.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
no
sir.
that
is
not
but
part
of
the
statute
--
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
no
sir.
but
the
largest
gambling
place
in
the
city
of
jacksonville
is
a
golf
track
and
i
never
heard.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
yes
sir.
and
i
have
never
heard
of
either
the
president
of
the
board
of
directors
there
or
and
any
employees
in
connection
with
it
being
arrested
under
this
ordinance.
the
argument
that
the
only
vise
of
the
statute
is
archaic
language,
misses
a
serious
point.
it
is
not
that
the
statute
or
the
ordinance
contains
language
which
is
archaic.
mr.
austin
struck
the
archaic
language.
i
do
not
know
what
he
would
choose
to
take
and
what
he
would
choose
to
leave.
what
would
he
do
for
example
with
persons
neglecting
all
lawful
business
and
habitually
spending
their
time
by
frequent
houses
of
ill
fame,
gaming
houses
or
places
where
alcoholic
beverages
are
sold
or
served.
the
person
is
able
to
work
with
habitually
living
upon
the
earnings
of
their
wives
or
minor
children
or
the
language
habitual
loafers
or
persons
for
wandering
or
strolling
from
place
to
place
without
any
lawful
purpose
or
outing.
there
is
nothing
archaic
about
that
language
and
it
is
not
that
the
language
of
the
ordinance
is
archaic,
it
is
said
that
the
thrust,
the
concept
which
the
ordinance
represents
is
archaic
and
it
is
outside
the
boundaries
of
what
is
considered
minimal
due
process
or
minimal
decency
by
our
current
standards.
further
it
is
not
simply
and
i
want
to
make
this
point
as
emphatically
as
i
can,
it
is
not
simply
vagueness
that
we
complain
about.
as
much
as
that,
we
complain
about
the
extent
and
sweep
of
the
statute,
not
only
is
it
difficult
to
understand
who
is
within
it
but
when
somebody
is
determined
to
be
within
it
they
are
subject
to
this
recurring
and
constant
sort
of
classification.
our
basic
complaint
is
that
it
is
unconstitutional
to
deal
with
these
matters
by
status
proscriptions
of
the
sort
that
are
had
here
even
if
there
were
some
way
were
found
to
make
the
ordinance
sufficiently
definite
to
pass
vagrants
test.
mr.
austin
complains
that
the
city
has
been
brought
here
without
any
review
on
the
facts
by
the
florida
system
and
he
says
that
there
was
no
way
that
the
florida
system
could
have
granted
him
set
review.
on
the
contrary
the
florida
courts
could
--
if
they
had
one
or
two,
go
beyond
the
relief
or
the
theory
of
what
the
petitioners
sought
down
there
in
the
same
way
that
this
court
did
in
johnson
versus
florida
and
three
years
ago
on
a
similar
vagrancy
case.
but
the
florida
court
shows
not
to
and
i
submit
that
the
reason
that
it
shows
not
to
is
that
they
are
not
opposed
to
that
they
approve
the
application
of
the
vagrancy
concept
and
the
clearest
manifestation
of
that
is
the
way
in
which
the
florida
supreme
court
responded
when
this
court’s
order
in
the
johnson
case
was
sent
back
to
them.
the
peevish
grudging,
sort
of
sarcastic
and
resentful
language
of
the
florida
supreme
court’s
opinion
reflects
the
attitude
of
the
florida
courts
on
these
questions
and
unless
relief
comes
from
this
court,
there
is
going
to
be
no
relief.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
yes.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
yes
sir,
it
is.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
in
both.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
johnson
versus
state
in
florida.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
right.
finally,
i
find
myself
taken
aback
at
little
bit
aghast
to
two
of
mr.
austin’s
contentions.
first,
the
contention
that
this
does
not
make
much
difference
because
only
three
people
a
day
and
about
a
thousand
people
a
year
in
jacksonville
are
subjected
to
arrest
under
this
statute.
if
it
is
unconstitutional,
one
person
a
year
is
too
many
but
regardless
of
that,
the
plain
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
three
people
a
day
and
more
than
a
thousand
persons
a
year
is
horrendous
number
to
be
subjected
to
the
sort
of
abuses
handed
out
in
the
--
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
well,
i
hope
he
did
not.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
i
hope
he
did
not.
finally,
i
have
taken
aback
just
much
by
his
statement
that
the
vagrancy
concept
is
so
important
to
law
enforcement
that
it
goes
to
the
heart
of
law
enforcement.
just
two
days
ago
this
court
heard
someone
from
the
attorney
generals
office
stand
here
and
say
that
these
victims
whose
crimes
are
no
longer
regarded
as
necessary
by
florida
law
enforcement
and
it
would
be
taken
out
in
the
new
revision
of
the
florida
criminal
codes.
we
have
heard
the
president
of
the
united
states
saying
that
it
is
time
to
do
away
with
it.
the
victim
was
trying
to
this
sort.
but
they
are
not
necessary
to
law
enforcement.
in
any
event,
if
by
some
stretch
they
are
useful,
if
by
some
stretch
they
are
helpful,
i
submit
that
we
come
to
poor
pass
where
it
is
contended
in
this
court
that
the
law
has
to
be
enforced
by
violating
the
constitution
and
i
certainly
hope
that
this
court
is
not
going
to
lend
any
support
to
any
such
contention.
we
submit
that
the
vagrancy
ordinance
that
is
before
the
court
now
is
a
horrible
and
it
reaches
an
example
of
legislative
excess.
we
submit
that
there
will
be
continued
abuse
and
that
the
only
proper
relief
that
can
be
had
is
for
the
court
at
this
time
to
proceed
to
strike
this
down
ordinance.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
conviction
of
eight
persons
for
vagrancy
in
the
municipal
court
of
the
city
of
jacksonville,
florida
under
the
jacksonville
vagrancy
ordinance.
petitioners
and
the
trial
court
and
through
the
florida
appellant
system
contended
that
the
ordinance
upon
which
they
were
convicted
was
facially
invalid
and
they
are
now
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
first
district
court
of
appeals,
state
of
florida
where
they
began
off
with
the
same
contentions.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
right.
i
was
just
going
to
mention
that
of
--
we
treated
that
on
the
possibility
that
the
city
might
have
kept
following
back
after
our
brief
was
filed
on
the
state
statute
that
--
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
they
have
not
done
so
and
i
do
not
think
the
state’s
statute
is
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
they
are
very
similar
so
that
i
do
not
think
it
makes
much
different
but
there
is
no
question
that
the
statute
is
not
involved
now.
the
only
contention
that
we
do
offer
is
that
the
city
ordinance
is
on
its
face
unconstitutional
and
invalid.
we
contend
at
the
same
time
that
the
whole
ordinance
is
unconstitutional.
we
argue
that
the
petitioners
in
this
case
were
convicted
generally
of
vagrancy
at
least
cannot
be
said
this
with
regard
to
seven
of
them
that
they
were
convicted
under
any
specific
sub-part
of
the
ordinance
in
question
and
that
as
a
result
under
this
court’s
previous
rulings
that
they
are
able
to
show
that
any
part
of
the
general
legislation
is
unconstitutional
then
they
are
entitled
to
a
reversal
of
the
acquittal.
because
our
attack
is
limited
to
the
facial
validity
of
the
ordinance,
i
do
not
propose
to
go
into
the
statements
of
facts
that
were
set
out
by
stipulation
with
the
city
in
the
petitioners’
brief
unless
there
is
some
question
about
one
particular
case
from
any
member
of
court.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
yes
sir.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
the
evidence
was
that
brown
came
out
of
a
hotel
which
was
suppose
to
be
of
low
repute
and
that
as
he
walked
out
of
the
hotel
he
was
moving
and
it
was
late
at
night
and
then
he
had
something
that
resembled
money
in
his
hands
and
that
two
police
officers
who
were
there
were
suspicious
of
him
and
they
called
--
they
then
called
him
over
as
he
walked
down
the
street
unless
his
movement
down
the
street
could
be
considered
loitering,
i
do
not
know
that
there
would
be
any
evidence
of
loitering
in
the
case.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
brown
situation
is
added
to
round
off
the
package
of
these
cases
because
we
assume
that
the
city
would
contend
that
there
were
circumstances
in
which
something
like
vagrancy
statute
and
ordinance
would
be
required
through
offenders
or
hardcore
criminal
and
we
did
want
to
bring
in
instance
of
at
least
that
sort
of
alleged
situation
before
the
court.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
i
think
that
if
brown
were
here
alone
his
case
would
not
be
nearly
so
appealing
as
the
other
people,
some
of
them
who
suffered
really
blatant
depression
though.
i
do
not
think
however
that
the
grossness
of
brown’s
character
and
his
testimony
against
him
would
really
affect
the
attack
on
the
facial
validity
of
the
ordinance.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
yes
sir.
narcotics
charge
was
brought
against
him,
was
subsequently
dismissed
because
in
the
code
of
proper
jurisdiction
for
that
charge
it
was
found
that
the
narcotics
had
been
found
by
reason
of
an
unreasonable
search
because
it
was
being
stopped
from
the
occasional
questioning.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
it
goes
back
farther
then
the
earlier
colonial
ordinances
mr.
chief
justice,
it
is
very
strikingly
similar
to
an
ordinance
of
1597
that
brought
together
the
old
english
legislation
up
to
that
date
of
the
statute
of
elizabeth.
one
of
the
commentators
in
fact
pointed
out
the
striking
similarity
between
this
legislation
and
that.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
i
have
not
been
able
to
ascertain
that.
i
tried
to
find
out
but
jacksonville
like
a
lot
of
small
towns
had
a
devastating
fire
at
one
time
that
burned
down
the
courthouse.
i
--
the
own
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
i
have
not
been
able
to
find
it.
i
have
checked
with
the
city
attorney’s
office
and
went
back
and
reviewed
all
available
records,
i
could
find
suggestions
to
it
and
can
say
that
it
came
into
existence
in
the
early
part
of
the
century.
but
precisely
when,
we
were
just
able
to
ascertain.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
yes
sir.
that
is
correct.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
and
considerably
more
for.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
we
contend
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
vagrancy
as
prowling
by
auto,
really
a
--
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
it
does
not
make
any
difference.
in
florida,
i
had
mentioned
the
president
of
the
united
states
in
the
city
of
jacksonville
could
be
a
vagrant
if
assuming
that
there
is
any
ascertainable
statute
in
this
ordinance
under
certain
circumstances
--
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
that
goes
to
our
contention
that
the
ordinance
is
unconstitutionally
vague.
and
more
than
that
--
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
well,
who
was
able
to
work
and
what
is
officially
living
on
the
earnings
of
one’s
wives
and
minor
children?
that
is
what
we
contend,
we
further
contend
that
that
invades
restricted
area
of
privacy
that
the
state
is
not
entitled
to
hold.
when
all
this
said
and
done,
it
is
difficult
to
understand
why
the
vagrancy
concept
is
persistent
for
as
long
as
it
had
any
way
of
the
--
the
plain
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
it
was
born
in
the
peculiar
socio-economic
needs
of
feudal
england
and
elizabethan
england
broadened
over
a
period
of
some
200
or
300
years
all
going
back
400
or
500
years
before
now
and
really
has
no
application
to
the
current
needs
of
our
society
and
more
than
is
offensive
in
many
of
our
settled
and
fundamental
notions
of
democracy
and
further
than
that
it
has
been
criticized
almost
universally
by
the
commentators
and
in
recent
years
by
the
state
courts
and
lower
federal
courts
in
that
occasions
considering
on
the
merits.
and
yet,
even
though
the
florida
ordinance
and
the
jacksonville’s
--
the
florida
statute
and
jacksonville
ordinance
which
is
really
derived
from
the
florida
statute
are
probably
the
most
arcades
of
all
of
the
state
statutes,
the
florida
system
has
tenaciously
functional
--
.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
not
at
all.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
in
the
city
of
jacksonville
alone
in
the
first
ten
months
of
1971
there
had
been
986
arrests.
i
do
not
know
how
many
had
been
over
the
state
and
the
last
figures
published
by
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation,
the
last
crime
statistics
for
the
nation
as
a
whole
and
statistics
covering
approximately
a
hundred
and
forty
million
people,
there
were
over
a
hundred
and
six
thousands
arrests,
that
was
in
1959.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
and
it
--
across
the
country,
yes
sir.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
very
aggressively
utilized.
not
only
are
there
arrests,
there
are
also
substantial
conviction
with
jail
time
imposed.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
at
the
time
of
these
cases,
since
then
in
order
to
avoid
the
fifth
circuit’s
ruling
with
its
regard
to
the
right
of
counsel
and
petty
offenses
which
was
before
the
court.
on
monday,
it
is
the
maximum
if
they
are
not
limited
to
75
days
with
no
right
of
aggregation
though,
offense
is,
flat
75
day
maximum.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
yes
sir.
that
was
because
of
somewhat
probably
dictum
in
fifth
circuit
cases
saying
that
a
$500.00
fine
activated
the
right
to
counsel.
we
contend
that
the
legislation
is
invalid
on
several
constitutional
basis,
the
first
one
and
the
easiest
one
is
--
that
it
is
void
for
vagueness.
this
court,
going
back
as
far
as
50
years
ago
in
connally
versus
general
construction
company
said
that
legislation
required
that
a
normal
and
ordinary
person
guesses
to
its
meaning
and
about
which
was
reasonable
--
might
differ
was
unconstitutionality
vague.
it
would
seem
to
us
that
the
requirement
that
there
be
definiteness
in
a
criminal
statute
or
a
statute
of
this
sort,
really
is
necessary
for
basically
three
functions.
one,
to
provide
notice
to
affected
persons,
two,
to
provide
ascertainable
standards
of
enforcement
for
the
people
who
are
charged
with
enforcement
and,
three,
to
provide
a
breathing
space
or
to
eliminate
chill
with
people
who
would
wish
to
exercise
preferred
rights
or
constitutionally
guaranteed
rights.
the
first
question,
that
is
what
this
legislation
provides
notice,
almost
answers
itself.
it
is
really
impossible
to
read
the
legislation
and
be
able
to
put
any
definite
meaning
on
virtually
anyone
of
the
various
subparts.
if
you
begin
with
the
initial
provision
of
rogues,
i
do
not
know
who
could
define
what
a
rogue
is
and
if
he
moves
through
and
ends
with
the
provision
that
mr.
justice
brennan
spoke
up
dealing
with
able
bodied
people
who
habitually
live
on
the
earnings
of
their
wives
or
minor
children,
i
do
not
know
that
anybody
can
put
any
precise
definition
on
that
language.
certainly
it
is
clear
that
the
ordinance
is
a
good
deal,
more
vague
and
elusive
than
the
ordinance
or
the
statute
that
was
struck
down
some
30
or
40
years
ago
by
this
court
in
lanzetta
versus
new
jersey
dealing
with
people
who
associate
themselves
with
gangs
of
more
than
three
or
more
persons.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
we
are
asking
you
to
strike
it
down
independently
of
the
applications
in
these
cases.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
no
sir.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
we
contend
--
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
well,
in
two
ways,
in
the
beginning
these
people
were
charged
flatly
with
vagrancy.
it
is
our
contention
there
is
language
which
appears
on
the
docket
entry
which
forms
the
charging
instrument
in
the
municipal
court
--
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
no.
we
say
that
that
does
not
limit
it.
that
for
example
as
mr.
justice
marshall
pointed
out,
there
are
some
of
these
people
who
were
charged
with
vagrancy
-
prowling
by
auto.
we
say
that
that
is
simply
an
explanatory
statement
by
the
arresting
police
officer
regarded
as
surplus
by
the
court.
it
is
not
legally
limiting
to
the
charge
at
all.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
that
is
right.
for
which
reason,
we
contend
that
they
were
in
effect
charged
with
vagrancy
generally
that
--
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
correct.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
very
definitely.
we
contend
that
no
one
could
ever
know
what
is
to
be
prescribed
by
this
ordinance.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
ordinarily,
he
is
not.
there
is
a
specifically
--
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
presumably
he
could
be.
i
am
not
able
to
answer
–
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
i
would
say
so
because
he
has
no
way
of
knowing
before
he
gets
himself
in
that
state,
what
a
common
drunkard
is
and
whether
he
is
going
to
be
subject
to
the
ordinance,
if
he
puts
himself
in
that
position.
yet
--
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
jimmy
lee
smith
is
the
only
one
that
is
not
in
the
category
that
i
spoke
of.
he
is
charged
with
something
that
is
specifically
according
to
the
ordinance.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
no
sir.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
no
sir.
one
man
is
charged
with
disorderly
loitering
on
the
street
and
there
is
something
in
there
that
relates
to
disorderly
people.
but
there
is
nothing
on
loitering
--
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
i
do
not
know.
it
has
no
basis
in
the
ordinance
and
that
is
why
we
contend
that
it
really
simply,
if
it
was
legally
limiting
in
any
way
then
our
motion
to
dismiss
at
the
prowl
would
have
been
acquired
and
been
granted.
i
will
say
this.
at
the
time
the
legislation
was
begun,
there
was
a
category
florida
law
known
as
common
thief
which
persisted
up
until
the
early
part
of
the
century
providing
that
anybody
who
had
can
convict
of
theft
constituting
a
felony
for
two
times
or
more
became
a
common
thief
and
was
subject
to
20
years
of
imprisonment.
that
was
in
existence
at
the
time
this
legislation
was
passed
and
this
legislation
do
not
refer
to
--
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
crude
one
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
a
crude
one.
crude
resit
of
the
statute.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
and
at
that
time
that
was
the
case.
yes,
if
you
--
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
that
was
a
state
statute,
any
time
he
walked
around
the
state
of
florida.
that
statute
is
no
longer
in
effect
but
we
have
the
same
thing
being
done
in
a
municipal
ordinance
in
this
instance.
he
could
only
be
sent
to
jail
for
75
days
but
if
he
has
been
guilty
of
some
sort
of
thief
whether
theft
whether
he
has
been
convicted
of
it
or
not,
it
might
be
contended
that
he
was
in
the
thieves
calender
--
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
my
point
is
that
we
do
not
know
what
common
thief
is,
some
or
two
of
these
individuals
were
charged
of
being
common
thieves.
and
if
that
has
no
reference
to
the
ordinance,
the
ordinance
does
refer
to
thieves
and
the
ordinance
would
have
the
effect
that
you
have
spoken
of
for
people
who
might
be
considered
within
the
category
of
thieves
whatever
that
is.
the
vagrancy
is
a
continuing
offense
if
somebody
had
committed
a
theft
or
has
been
convicted
of
a
theft
for
two
or
three,
whether
--
however
long
ago
it
had
been
or
however
minor
it
has
been
or
however
much
more
he
has
been
convicted
of
it,
he
is
subject
to
continuing
incarceration.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
he
cannot
walk
the
street
of
jacksonville
without
being
subject
to
arrest.
if
this
legislation
was
out.
he
can
serve
75
days
and
immediately
on
release
and
subject
to
an
arrest.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
the
more
confirmed
it
is.
yes
sir.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
i
am
not
able
to
say,
mr.
chief
justice.
nobody
knows,
that
is
precisely
--
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
no.
that
is
the
point.
there
is
no
reference
to
common
in
this
ordinance,
this
legislation.
in
subprior
legislation
that
was
in
inexistence
--
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
that
is
true.
i
am
speaking
with
regard
to
thieves.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
that
is
true.
but
there,
there
was
a
legislative
definition
of
what
common
law
is.
i
do
not
know
--
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
we
can
only
suppose.
that
is
a
good
point.
with
regard
to
the
vagueness
point,
we
think
that
the
merit
was
capsulized
very
well
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
winters
versus
new
york
in
1940
something.
he
there
pointed
out
that
this
type
of
legislation
falls
in
the
unique
category
that
--
it
is
perfectly
designed
to
be
vague,
purposely
designed
to
be
open,
and
it
is
significance
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
did
that
and
it
is
further
significant
that
he
did
it
in
the
circumstances
in
which
he
did
because
he
was
there
dissenting
from
a
majority
holding
that
legislation
was
unconstitutionally
vague
and
he
had
catalogued
the
reasons
why
the
court
should
be
very
hesitant
to
declare
a
legislation
unconstitutionally
vague
and
he
specified
as
an
exception
the
area
of
vagrancy
in
which
he
said
within
a
unique
category,
by
itself
it
was
egregiously
bad.
in
addition
to
the
problem
of
lack
of
notice
to
affected
persons
we
also
have
a
problem
that
is
presented
by
lack
of
some
sort
of
enforcement
standards.
there
is
no
way.
and
the
police
officer
or
jury
and
municipal
judge
or
anybody
else
could
know
what
is
intended
at.
and
this
in
and
of
itself
and
by
--
stand
unless
a
discriminatory
enforcement
especially
when
we
have
legislation
of
the
ultimate
--
sort
of
that
we
have
here
that
can
be
directed
and
applied
to
unconventional
or
unpopular
or
unestablished
people
of
the
sort
--
quite
of
these
anyway
from
people
who
are
or
not
willing
to
be
broadminded
than
others.
apparently
the
legislation,
because
of
its
breadth
and
broadness,
necessarily
must
restrict
people.
in
the
attempted
exercise
and
the
desired
exercise,
the
rights
that
are
preserved
to
them
without
question
about
the
constitution,
certainly
the
right
of
travel
is
drawn
into
question
by
the
provision
against
wandering
from
place
to
place
for
example.
and
we
have
enumerated
others
in
our
brief
with
the
suggestion
how
they
might
be
similarly
effective.
apart
from
that
contention,
we
also
contend
under
a
broad
grouping
that
we
called
abuse
of
police
power
that
the
ordinance
is
constitutionally
invalid
in
other
respects.
we
contend
first
that
insofar
as
it
relates
to
people
who
are
in
the
category
of
mr.
justice
brennan
spoke
off
living
on
the
earnings
of
their
wives
and
so
on
that
it
invades
the
zone
of
privacy
that
was
thought
to
be
secured
by
griswold
versus
connecticut.
further
even
in
the
part
of
the
ordinance
which
deals
with
thieves
and
gamblers
and
what
have
you
which
might
be
outside
that
area,
the
legislation
is
still
overbroad
because
of
the
completeness
of
its
application.
the
point
that
mr.
justice
stewart
was
speaking
of
where
it
can
be
applied
recurrently
over
and
over
again
against
one
individual,
so
that
he
becomes
permanently
an
outcast
and
permanently
subject
to
incarceration.
in
this
regard,
it
is
significant
to
note
that
the
only
justification
offered
for
that
kind
of
breadth
and
scope
by
the
city
of
jacksonville
its
prime
control
and
it
is
significant
that
they
are
ample
prime
control
methods
available
to
the
city
of
jacksonville
or
the
state
of
florida
that
can
accomplish
the
same
purposes
that
this
legislation
can
accomplish
without
nearly
the
oppression
to
human
and
individual
rights.
we
say
also
as
a
third
major
point
and
related
to
the
abuse
of
police
power,
that
really,
the
legislation
is
no
more
than
a
legislative
declaration
that
some
people
are
suspicious
per
se,
that
some
people
are
tending
the
crime
per
se
and
if
they
must
be
suppressed
at
the
outset,
he
independently
of
any
act
or
an
issue
on
that
part.
this
is
actually
borne
out
by
the
social
history
of
the
legislation
by
the
contention
that
is
made
by
the
city
expressed
in
its
brief
and
by
the
history
of
application
well
documented
by
boards
such
as
the
president’s
commission
on
law
enforcement
and
the
american
bar
association’s
foundation
for
criminal
justice
which
have
all
found
that
the
legislation
is
used
primarily
for
the
arrest
of
people
on
suspicion
only
when
police
officers
require
or
make
ways
and
they
cannot
find
anything
else
to
use
--
its
grounds
for
an
arrest.
but
we
say
that
this
pattern
in
tradition
of
use,
has
become
inevitable
part
of
the
statute
and
in
fact,
it
has
resulted
because
it
was
built
into
the
statutes
or
into
the
ordinance
in
the
first
the
instance
and
it
would
only
be
inevitable
result
--
and
will
continue
unless
the
legislation
is
now
struck
down.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
time.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
i
would
like
first
to
respond
to
some
of
the
explicit
statements
made
by
mr.
austin.
the
contention
that
we
are
out
of
court
because
the
writ
has
been
misdirected
that
we
submit
is
no
more
than
a
cripple
--
it
is
not
entitled
to
any
standing.
we
treated
this
question
at
some
length
in
our
reply
brief.
the
matter
was
also
litigated
in
connection
with
the
application
for
a
writ
of
certiorari.
if
in
fact
the
city
is
correct
that
the
writ
was
misdirected,
the
simple
answer
would
be
for
the
review
that
this
court
makes
to
be
at
the
circuit
court
order
which
can
well
be
done
and
that
that
is
the
proper
remedy
in
connection
with
the
application
for
certiorari.
we
responded
to
the
city's
response
by
saying
that
we
would
be
very
pleased
for
the
writ
to
be
directed
to
the
circuit
court
instead
of
to
the
first
district
if
that
was
the
appropriate
choice.
we
think
that
it
makes
a
difference
with
--
it
is
a
difference
without
a
distinction
from
purposes
of
these
proceedings.
i
might
have
lost
to
understand
the
city's
recurrent
citation
of
the
headley
versus
selkowitz
language
by
the
florida
supreme
court
that
the
vagrancy
statute
is
not
be
used
very
liberally
by
florida
law
enforcement
officers.
i
do
not
see
how
that
provides
any
comfort
to
the
city.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
no
more
than
or
no
less
than
an
expressed
statement
that
law
enforcers,
that
law
enforcement
officers
are
not
to
make
any
even
handed
application
of
the
statute
but
that
they
are
given
license
and
freedom
to
decide
for
themselves
what
the
standards
of
arrest
are
going
to
be
which
to
us
seems
to
point
out
the
very
vise
of
the
statute
was
complained
about.
mr.
austin
says
that
it
was
not
intended
to
apply
just
to
poor
people
and
in
its
application
is
not
in
that
effect.
i
submit
that
while
it
may
not
have
been
--
may
not
be
applied
to
poor
people
alone
that
by
and
large
the
application
is
to
people
who
are
or
small
people
who
are
in
no
position
to
protest
or
make
the
protest
heard.
the
keeper
of
the
largest
gambling
place
in
florida
i
believe
is
the
president
of
race
track,
i
never
known
him
to
be
arrested
for
vagrancy
as
a
keeper
of
a
gambling
place.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
no
sir.
that
is
not
but
part
of
the
statute
--
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
no
sir.
but
the
largest
gambling
place
in
the
city
of
jacksonville
is
a
golf
track
and
i
never
heard.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
yes
sir.
and
i
have
never
heard
of
either
the
president
of
the
board
of
directors
there
or
and
any
employees
in
connection
with
it
being
arrested
under
this
ordinance.
the
argument
that
the
only
vise
of
the
statute
is
archaic
language,
misses
a
serious
point.
it
is
not
that
the
statute
or
the
ordinance
contains
language
which
is
archaic.
mr.
austin
struck
the
archaic
language.
i
do
not
know
what
he
would
choose
to
take
and
what
he
would
choose
to
leave.
what
would
he
do
for
example
with
persons
neglecting
all
lawful
business
and
habitually
spending
their
time
by
frequent
houses
of
ill
fame,
gaming
houses
or
places
where
alcoholic
beverages
are
sold
or
served.
the
person
is
able
to
work
with
habitually
living
upon
the
earnings
of
their
wives
or
minor
children
or
the
language
habitual
loafers
or
persons
for
wandering
or
strolling
from
place
to
place
without
any
lawful
purpose
or
outing.
there
is
nothing
archaic
about
that
language
and
it
is
not
that
the
language
of
the
ordinance
is
archaic,
it
is
said
that
the
thrust,
the
concept
which
the
ordinance
represents
is
archaic
and
it
is
outside
the
boundaries
of
what
is
considered
minimal
due
process
or
minimal
decency
by
our
current
standards.
further
it
is
not
simply
and
i
want
to
make
this
point
as
emphatically
as
i
can,
it
is
not
simply
vagueness
that
we
complain
about.
as
much
as
that,
we
complain
about
the
extent
and
sweep
of
the
statute,
not
only
is
it
difficult
to
understand
who
is
within
it
but
when
somebody
is
determined
to
be
within
it
they
are
subject
to
this
recurring
and
constant
sort
of
classification.
our
basic
complaint
is
that
it
is
unconstitutional
to
deal
with
these
matters
by
status
proscriptions
of
the
sort
that
are
had
here
even
if
there
were
some
way
were
found
to
make
the
ordinance
sufficiently
definite
to
pass
vagrants
test.
mr.
austin
complains
that
the
city
has
been
brought
here
without
any
review
on
the
facts
by
the
florida
system
and
he
says
that
there
was
no
way
that
the
florida
system
could
have
granted
him
set
review.
on
the
contrary
the
florida
courts
could
--
if
they
had
one
or
two,
go
beyond
the
relief
or
the
theory
of
what
the
petitioners
sought
down
there
in
the
same
way
that
this
court
did
in
johnson
versus
florida
and
three
years
ago
on
a
similar
vagrancy
case.
but
the
florida
court
shows
not
to
and
i
submit
that
the
reason
that
it
shows
not
to
is
that
they
are
not
opposed
to
that
they
approve
the
application
of
the
vagrancy
concept
and
the
clearest
manifestation
of
that
is
the
way
in
which
the
florida
supreme
court
responded
when
this
court’s
order
in
the
johnson
case
was
sent
back
to
them.
the
peevish
grudging,
sort
of
sarcastic
and
resentful
language
of
the
florida
supreme
court’s
opinion
reflects
the
attitude
of
the
florida
courts
on
these
questions
and
unless
relief
comes
from
this
court,
there
is
going
to
be
no
relief.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
yes.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
yes
sir,
it
is.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
in
both.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
johnson
versus
state
in
florida.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
right.
finally,
i
find
myself
taken
aback
at
little
bit
aghast
to
two
of
mr.
austin’s
contentions.
first,
the
contention
that
this
does
not
make
much
difference
because
only
three
people
a
day
and
about
a
thousand
people
a
year
in
jacksonville
are
subjected
to
arrest
under
this
statute.
if
it
is
unconstitutional,
one
person
a
year
is
too
many
but
regardless
of
that,
the
plain
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
three
people
a
day
and
more
than
a
thousand
persons
a
year
is
horrendous
number
to
be
subjected
to
the
sort
of
abuses
handed
out
in
the
--
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
well,
i
hope
he
did
not.
mr.
samuel
s.
jacobson
i
hope
he
did
not.
finally,
i
have
taken
aback
just
much
by
his
statement
that
the
vagrancy
concept
is
so
important
to
law
enforcement
that
it
goes
to
the
heart
of
law
enforcement.
just
two
days
ago
this
court
heard
someone
from
the
attorney
generals
office
stand
here
and
say
that
these
victims
whose
crimes
are
no
longer
regarded
as
necessary
by
florida
law
enforcement
and
it
would
be
taken
out
in
the
new
revision
of
the
florida
criminal
codes.
we
have
heard
the
president
of
the
united
states
saying
that
it
is
time
to
do
away
with
it.
the
victim
was
trying
to
this
sort.
but
they
are
not
necessary
to
law
enforcement.
in
any
event,
if
by
some
stretch
they
are
useful,
if
by
some
stretch
they
are
helpful,
i
submit
that
we
come
to
poor
pass
where
it
is
contended
in
this
court
that
the
law
has
to
be
enforced
by
violating
the
constitution
and
i
certainly
hope
that
this
court
is
not
going
to
lend
any
support
to
any
such
contention.
we
submit
that
the
vagrancy
ordinance
that
is
before
the
court
now
is
a
horrible
and
it
reaches
an
example
of
legislative
excess.
we
submit
that
there
will
be
continued
abuse
and
that
the
only
proper
relief
that
can
be
had
is
for
the
court
at
this
time
to
proceed
to
strike
this
down
ordinance.
