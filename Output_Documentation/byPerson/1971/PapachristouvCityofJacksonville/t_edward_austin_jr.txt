mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
attack,
assault
on
the
jacksonville
vagrancy
ordinance
as
it
is
defined
is
not
unique.
it
has
been
attacked
and
assaulted
up
through
the
florida
appellate
structure.
it
has
been
a
similar
ordinances
from
miami
have
been
declared
unconstitutional
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
florida.
the
supreme
court
of
the
florida
has
laid
down
a
standard
as
specific
as
you
can
get
in
this
type
of
a
situation
as
to
when
this
particular
type
of
ordinance
or
statute
will
be
enforced.
and
has
spelled
out
that
it
would
be
cautiously
and
sparingly
used
and
upon
vagrants
--
or
vagrancies
of
their
own
volition
and
this
has
been
reaffirmed
by
the
supreme
court
after
it
was
first
pronounced
in
1965.
this
particular
case
and
incidentally
your
honors
the
florida
supreme
court
has
in
previous
occasions
stricken
or
reversed
the
trial
courts
for
the
unconstitutional
application
of
this
particular
ordinance.
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
i
know
of
none
that
they
have
stricken
per
se
your
honor.
justice
ervin,
whom
i
consider
a
very
enlightened
jurist
--
our
supreme
court
has
acknowledged
that
certain
sections
of
the
vagrancy
statute
or
the
vagrancy
ordinance
have
simply
fallen
and
he
views
as
has
been
the
situation
in
hundreds
of
our
state
statutes
which
are
now
being
studied
and
being
revised
by
our
legislature
at
the
present
time.
he
acknowledges
in
one
of
his
opinions
that
gave
us
caution
and
guidance
in
this
area
that
the
--
if
the
facts
did
not
support
the
conviction,
if
the
court
should
not
hesitate
to
strike
him
down
it
may
unconstitutionally
apply.
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
your
honor,
i
assume
that
it
came
in
under
the
portion
of
the
ordinance
which
goes
to
wandering
and
strolling
about
from
place
to
place
without
unlawful
purpose.
i
think
the
idea
of
saying
that
a
vagrant
must
be
poor
or
that
this
is
applied
just
to
poor
people,
your
honor
is
not
the
intention
of
the
legislature
or
the
legislative
--
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
your
honor,
i
am
not
so
sure
that
--
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
your
honor
it
is
defined
down
through
this
--
let
me
say
this
and
i
am
not
evading
your
question,
this
language
was
in
existence.
in
an
answer
to
your
previous
question,
about
a
hundred
years
ago,
19
--
1880’s
--
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
yes
sir.
and
it
was
in
existence
when
the
--
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
yes
sir.
it
was
in
existence
before
the
--
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
well,
i
just
do
not
know
that
just
because
something
is
old
your
honor
that
it
is
bad.
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
is
old
and
--
we
went
through
black
law
dictionary,
we
went
through
webster’s
dictionary
and
words
and
phrases
and
we
have
no
trouble
defining
who
these
people
are.
and
we
think
that
they
are
--
or
advised
who
they
are.
now
i
would
be
--
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
no
sir,
your
honor.
that
would
be
--
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
i
think
that
would
be
an
unconstitutional
application
of
the
statute.
i
do
not
think
that
florida
would
hesitate
a
second
to
strike
it
down.
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
there
are
certain
parts
of
this
ordinance
that
have
incidentally
your
honor,
our
supreme
court
has
told
us
that
they
considered
unconstitutional
a
statute
that
made
a
person
explain
why
they
were
out
of
place
which
seems
to
be
the
model
penal
code's
approach
to
it
as
violative
of
the
fifth
amendment.
so
we
sort
of
do
not
know
what
to
do
and
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
florida
has
told
us
the
best
thing
we
have
is
the
vagrancy
statute
which
has
been
upheld
in
a
large
number
of
states
and
therefore
why
do
you
not
use
it
since
it
has
been
tried
and
tested.
but
it
did
not
delineate
or
pull
out
certain
words
that
should
have
been
omitted.
i
think
that
the
legislature,
i
would
be
first
to
--
i
had
been
candid
with
the
court
to
say
that
the
legislature
should
delete
some
of
these
words.
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
that
was
the
city
counsel
your
honor.
i
will
stipulate
that
some
of
the
words
should
come
out
of
the
ordinance.
and
i
think
legislatively
it
should
come
whether
or
not
the
entire
ordinance
goes
to
the
police
power
of
the
state,
the
very
heart
of
the
police
power
of
the
state
and
the
city
is
something
else
again
and
i
think
that
it
does.
but
let
me,
if
i
may
say
how
this
case
got
here.
we
have
a
very
fine
judge
on
our
circuit
court
bench
that
reviewed
this
case
when
it
was
brought
over
to
him
from
the
municipal
court.
the
only
thing
that
he
was
permitted
to
consider
was
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
on
its
face.
then
it
went
to
the
district
court
of
appeals
and
in
the
petitioner’s
brief
the
only
thing
he
asked
for
was
that
they
consider
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
on
its
face.
at
no
place
did
the
florida
court
get
to
look
at
these
facts.
i
will
be
candid
with
the
court.
they
have
made
allegations
here
that
they
are
not
even
under
the
ordinance
and
should
have
been
reversed
and
the
first
appellate
step
in
the
florida
appellate
structure
should
have
been
permitted
and
would
have
in
my
opinion
directed
the
municipal
court
to
straighten
that
out.
there
were
no
prosecutors
in
this
court
at
that
time.
and
they
go
in
and
it
is
an
unfortunate
situation
that
a
municipal
courts
run
the
way
they
did.
but
mr.
jacobson
makes
a
big
thing
out
of
900
and
some
vagrancy
arrests
this
year,
we
have
550,000
people
in
our
community.
that
is
approximately
three
a
day.
and
let
me
point
out
that
in
the
state
of
florida,
you
cannot
make
an
arrest
for
many,
many
of
the
things
that
are
mentioned
in
the
statute
unless
they
are
permitted
in
the
presence
of
the
officer,
only
authority.
if
it
is
a
misdemeanor
or
the
violation
of
municipal
ordinance,
if
the
officer
is
30
seconds
late,
he
is
required
to
go
around
to
a
magistrate
and
get
a
warrant.
so,
he
does
use
this
and
then
the
vagrancy
ordinance
and
then
the
charge
is
changed
as
is
often
the
case
in
the
administration
of
criminal
justice.
so
out
of
the
approximately
three
arrests
a
day,
many
of
them,
on
the
docket,
you
see,
the
next
morning
they
would
be
changed
although
the
arrest
was
vagrancy
because
he
was
30
seconds
late
in
getting
to
the
same
where
he
was
been
abroad
with
the
evidence
obvious
and
the
people
giving
the
officer
good
grounds
to
make
an
arrest
except
he
just
does
not
have
time
to
get
a
warrant.
and
it
is
a
very
practical
necessary
ordinance
for
the
maintenance
of
public
order
in
jacksonville,
florida.
just
because
it
is
old,
stipulating
that
the
legislature
should
strike
some
of
the
verdict.
just
because
it
is
old,
would
not
necessarily
seem
to
be
grounds
for
reversing
it.
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
your
honor
if
this
court
opens
the
door
to
the
florida
legislative
redrafting
session
we
today
are
now
going
into
by
simply
taking
from
the
first
court,
no
chance
to
look
at
the
facts.
district
court
of
appeal,
no
chance
to
look
at
the
fact
and
this
court
starts
looking
in
to
rewriting
the
florida
code,
we
will
find
about
200
statutes
that
need
to
have
the
language
updated.
and
this
is
no
exception.
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
i
respectfully
submit
your
honor
the
proper
function
--
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
yes
sir,
your
honor.
i
respectfully
submit
that
this
is
a
proper
function
for
the
legislature.
they
are
getting
to
it.
and
amazingly
they
are
getting
to
it
right
now
and
mr.
jacobson
is
here
to
redrafting
and
getting
our
code,
we
would
even
obtain
federal
funds
for
our
state
legislature
to
study
our
criminal
code
and
to
bring
it
up
to
date
and
to
get
rid
of
this
archaic
language.
but
i
submit
that
--
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
yes,
yes.
your
honor
i
have
absolutely
no
doubt,
i
am
general
counsel
for
the
city,
i
have
absolutely
no
doubt
that
when
some
guidance
comes
to
us
from
some
place
that
we
will
adopt
proper
language.
i
submit
that
in
studying
that
the
model
penal
code,
the
draft
of
1969,
that
some
scholar
drafted
that
it
will
probably
fall
from
constitutionality
because
it
permits
a
man
to
be
detained
for
20
minutes
just
because
he
acts
suspicious
and
so
i
do
not
know
--
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
and
in
those
places
where
the
archaic
language
appears,
if
it
is
a
policy
of
this
court,
i
would
stipulate
that
it
be
stricken,
if
that
is
the
policy
of
this
court.
i
do
not
think
it
is
before
this
court,
but
if
that
is
the
policy
of
this
court
i
will
stipulate
to
archaic
language
being
stricken.
i
think
the
next
case
before
you
is
very,
very
critical.
the
prowling
and
loitering
without
a
lawful
purpose
or
as
archaic
said
with
an
unlawful
purpose,
i
think
that
the
power
to
make
the
arrest
in
the
places
that
they
are
most
normally
made
and
incidentally
these
are
obviously
from
the
vast
number
of
cases,
the
worst
possible
factual
situations
that
could
have
gotten
before
this
court.
and
i
submit
that
the
florida
court
would
have
never
let
them
get
here.
it
would
have
been
reversed
immediately
by
the
district
court
of
appeals
because
they
do
not
even
charge
under
the
ordinance.
they
miss
the
ordinance
and
i
think
this
is
--
the
petitioner
is
asking
you
for
the
first
time.
this
court
in
a
florida
case
reversed
only
unconstitutional
application
in
johnson
in
1967,
reversed
on
the
unconstitutional
application
of
the
florida
vagrancy
statute
and
had
the
constitutionality
of
florida
vagrancy
statute
before
it.
now,
we
had
the
guidance
of
this
court,
we
had
the
guidance
of
the
florida
supreme
court
that
the
trial
judges
and
the
appellate
judges
would
reverse
on
the
unconstitutional
application
of
the
facts.
and
if
on
these
cases,
if
they
are
properly
before
you,
i
will
stipulate
that
they
were
not
unconstitutionally
applied.
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
no
sir.
no
sir
your
honor.
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
from
the
district
court
of
appeals
and
the
petitioner
said
the
only
issue
before
the
court
is
the
constitutionality
of
the
ordinance
on
its
face.
if
he
said
that
to
the
circuit
judge
who
sat
in
review
of
that
municipal
court.
he
has
never
asserted
that
these
facts
were
unconstitutionally
applied
which
has
been
the
law
of
this
court
and
of
the
florida
courts
in
this
area
in
the
last
few
years.
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
i
say
they
were
not
asked
to
do
that
--
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
you
are
asking
if
the
judge
will
go
beyond
the
request
relief
by
the
lawyer
when
he
goes
in
on
appeal.
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
your
honor,
our
interest
in
only
in
the
jacksonville
and
i
do
not
think
in
most
of
the
other
sections
of
the
country
work
that
way
if
a
lawyer
waives
all
the
points
except
one,
that
is
the
only
one
the
court
would
consider.
that
has
been
the
policy
of
this
court.
if
you
do
not
raise
you
should
waive
it.
and
this
was
all
that
was
submitted
and
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
of
appeals
from
which
certiorari
is
granted
here.
the
only
thing
that
the
court
points
out
in
that
opinion
that
the
only
thing
before
them
by
the
petition
which
the
petitioner
says.
the
only
thing
before
us
is
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
statute
on
its
face.
now
--
your
honor
i
will
submit
that
that
is
basically
unfair
that
the
florida
judiciary
did
not
give
him
a
chance
to
review
the
very
things
that
you
are
being
asked
to
review
these
cases
on
the
merits
--
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
it
should
have
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
reserve
that
point.
i
am
not
trying
to
evade
this
court
considering
this
case
but
i
think
i
have
a
duty
to
raise
it,
that
justice
holmes
said
that
if
he
did
not
come
in
from
the
proper
court
that
you
would
be
dismissed
but
this
case
came
from
the
district
court
of
appeals,
where
all
the
district
court
of
appeals
has
run
this.
it
was
review
in
certiorari.
so
if
you
are
reviewing
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
of
appeals
which
mr.
jacobson
has
asked
you
to
do,
you
are
merely
reviewing
whether
or
not
this
is
very
true
limited
--
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
the
first
district
court
of
appeals,
the
circuit
court
did
not
pass
on
the
merits.
they
simply
took
it.
they
gave
a
brief
opinion
that
the
statute
was
constitutional.
but
they
did
not
and
were
not
permitted
--
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
yes
sir,
but
they
were
not
permitted
to
look
at
the
facts.
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
yes
sir.
but
they
were
not
permitted
to
look
at
the
facts
--
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
the
writ
should
have
gone
back
to
the
original
court,
your
honor
to
the
circuit
court
which
was
the
court
that,
according
to
justice
holmes
that
the
petitioners
should
have
come
up
from.
that
was
the
court
that
entered
the
judgment,
the
district
court
of
appeals
merely
commented
that
the
statute
was
constitutional
but
denied
certiorari.
so
that
is
not
a
judgment
and
he
should
have
gone
from
here
--
since
he
came
from
the
wrong
court
and
justice
holmes
says
that
is
fake,
as
we
cited
that
in
our
brief.
i
would
like
to
submit
to
the
court
and
in
this
brief
time,
we
certainly
cannot
go
into
a
deep
alluded
philosophical
discussion
but
as
old
as
this
statute
is,
it
is
archaic,
as
some
of
the
language
is
the
very
important
law
enforcement
tool.
it
goes
to
the
very
heart
of
police
power
of
our
municipality
and
to
the
police
power
of
the
state
of
florida.
and
if
it
needs
to
be
revised
this
court
has
time
after
time
spoken
of
the
fact
that
it
will
not
strike
a
statute
if
it
can
be
construed
to
be
constitutional
but
it
must
be
beyond
any
reasonable
doubt
unconstitutional
and
the
fact
that
some
archaic
language
in
a
statute
does
not
make
it
unconstitutional
in
its
total
situation.
this
court
has
in
fact
held
that
it
has
a
duty
to
uphold
the
police
power
measure,
if
it
bears
some
rational
relationship
to
health,
safety,
morals
or
general
welfare
and
the
means
employed
reasonably
accomplishes
the
desired
result.
the
means
here
were
probably
an
unconstitutional
application
of
a
statute.
but
then
this
ordinance
read
in
its
totality
must
be
considered
and
i
honestly
submit
to
the
court,
must
be
considered
to
be
a
valid
exercise
of
the
police
power.
and
the
fact
it
is
not
inarticulately
drawn
is
immaterial
if
it
goes
to
the
relationship
of
health,
safety,
morals
and
general
welfare.
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
you
cannot
read
this
without
saying
that
it
goes
to
the
general
welfare,
the
public
safety.
i
could
give
you
a
list
of
illustrations.
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
no
sir.
i
think
we
have
to
--
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
the
civil
rights
act
that
was
sustained
back
in
the
'64
was
pretty
vague.
we
talk
in
terms
of
vagueness
your
honor,
i
do
not
mean
to
appear
to
be
flippant
but
and
i
am
not,
certainly
that
i
have
the
deepest
respect.
the
guidelines
laid
down
in
roth
for
example,
and
cited
in
our
brief,
the
reasonable
speed
of
many
words
that
just
defy
strict
definition
and
as
justice
frankfurter
pointed
out
on
a
number
of
occasions
that
this
balance
between
the
maintenance
of
public
order
and
criminal
conduct
and
drawing
words
and
language
broad
enough
to
protect
the
public
and
narrow
enough
to
protect
the
individual
is
what
it
is
all
about
and
it
is
really
--
there
is
no
handbook
on
legislative
drafting
that
this
will
be
constitutional
and
this
would
be
not.
this
is
a
tremendously
complex
difficult
area.
and
so
i
will
simply
submit
it
on
the
fact
that
it
is
not
unconstitutionally
vague
in
view
of
the
many
words,
that
this
court
has
held
to
be
constitutional,
not
constitutionally
vague.
and
our
brief
cites
many
illustrations
to
that.
there
must
be
a
place
on
reasonable
application
of
this
particular
ordinance
and
phrases
within
these
ordinance
where
it
would
be
held
to
be
constitutional
therefore
it
cannot
be
stricken
on
it
face
under
the
laws
or
under
the
rules
laid
down
by
this
court
because
in
many
provisions
of
it,
which
saved
it.
and
it
is
vital
to
the
protection
of
the
public
and
the
corporate
city,
the
consolidated
government
of
the
city
of
jacksonville.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
i
have
read
most
of
the
commentaries
of
mr.
jacobson,
my
brother
has
cited
to
the
court,
i
find
very
little
that
it
is
written
about
the
police.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
police
departments
today
in
the
metropolitan
areas
such
as
jacksonville,
florida
are
watched
by
the
media,
television,
news
paper,
they
are
watched
by
the
prosecutor,
they
are
watched
by
the
human
relations
committees,
they
are
watched
by
the
civil
liberties
union,
they
are
watched
by
the
sheriff
himself
because
he
is
the
elected
official.
we
have
one
police
department
in
our
government.
they
are
watched
by
the
executive
arm
of
the
government.
they
are
watched
by
the
courts.
if
they
have
come
in
with
bad
evidence,
if
they
make
any
illegal
search,
their
evidence
is
suppressed.
and
the
idea
that
there
is
hanging
over
jacksonville,
i
noticed
that
these
cases
were
very
selectively
brought
to
your
attention
that
there
is
hanging
over
jacksonville,
some
threat
of
the
police
power
taking
over
or
being
abused
is
manifestly
not
fair
to
the
functions
of
the
police
department.
we
have
a
thousand,
obviously
we
are
going
to
get
some
bad
outlets.
if
you
are
pouring
a
personal
reference
until
a
week
ago,
(inaudible)
prosecuted
a
bad
outlet.
but
to
say
that
they
are
all
bad
or
that
they
are
abusing
their
authority
perpetually
under
this
particular
ordinances
is
manifestly
unfair.
tree
arrest
a
day
in
a
city
of
550,000
people
cannot
be
a
wide,
broad
use
of
this
statute
when
you
are
considering
that
it
is
being
applied
in
order
that
some
arrest
can
be
made
that
could
not
otherwise
be
made
to
protect
the
public.
i
respectfully
submit
your
honors
that
the
crime
rate
of
the
united
states
has
grown
up
according
to
the
authority
cited
by
mr.
jacobson,
400%
in
the
last
25
years.
the
population
has
grown
up
50%.
we
have
not
been
able
to
keep
abreast
of
it
in
our
community.
43%
according
to
mr.
jacobson
are
people
in
his
authorities
are
afraid
to
walk
down
the
streets
at
night
alone
in
our
community.
we
need
to
modernize
our
ordinances
and
our
statutes
to
do
something
to
help
us
and
to
get
the
balance
back
in
the
administration
of
criminal
justice.
we
need
to
modernize
this
ordinance.
i
do
not
know
the
answer.
i
would
assume
that
the
people
of
florida
will
elect
people
who
can
make
those
decisions
with
the
advice
of
the
courts
that
they
will
make
the
decisions
or
rather
or
not
they
can
make
this
type
of
conduct
illegal.
and
that
those
people
that
they
elect
will
make
the
appropriate
decision
and
then
if
they
unconstitutionally
have
stepped
over
the
bounds
of
the
first
ten
amendments
which
justice
black
spoke
so
eloquently
about
then
they
are
stricken
down.
but
if
they
do
not
and
i
submit
that
there
is
not
a
single
thing
here
that
steps
over
the
bound
of
the
first
ten
amendments
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
or
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
you
are
being
asked
to
in
this
case
because
our
courts
did
not
have
an
opportunity
to
get
to
the
heart
of
this
matter.
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
i
suggest
that
the
long
line
of
cases
of
this
court
are
that
you
would
not
strike
any
portion
of
the
statute
that
is
constitutional
on
its
face
and
you
would
only
strike
those
provisions
which
were
unconstitutional
on
their
face.
so
yes
sir,
i
am
asking
you
if
you
are
going
to
do
something
with
it,
to
rewrite
it,
i
would
welcome
it.
it
has
given
me
and
the
people
who
seem
to
draft
these
things
have
headaches,
the
model
penal
code
which
i
would
refer
you
to
who
is
coming
in
for
how
rush
should
be
made
is
--
i
do
not
see
how
it
could
be
interpreted
any
differently
that
the
big
part
of
vagrancy
statute
is
applied.
the
police
officer
must
have
some
discretion
and
this
is
place
that
he
has
some.
and
if
you
have
changed
the
wordings,
he
is
still
is
going
to
have
some
discretion.
and
he
is
as
i
said
watched
night
and
day
by
all
of
these
authorities.
i
would
like
to
thank
the
court
for
considering
the
position
of
the
city
of
jacksonville
and
honestly
solicit
that
you
dismiss
this
writ
as
it
is
improper
to
granted
since
it
came
from
the
improper
court
and
further
to
construe
those
portions
of
the
statute,
if
you
can
construe
it
at
all
which
are
constitutional
to
be
constitutional.
thank
you
your
honors.
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
attack,
assault
on
the
jacksonville
vagrancy
ordinance
as
it
is
defined
is
not
unique.
it
has
been
attacked
and
assaulted
up
through
the
florida
appellate
structure.
it
has
been
a
similar
ordinances
from
miami
have
been
declared
unconstitutional
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
florida.
the
supreme
court
of
the
florida
has
laid
down
a
standard
as
specific
as
you
can
get
in
this
type
of
a
situation
as
to
when
this
particular
type
of
ordinance
or
statute
will
be
enforced.
and
has
spelled
out
that
it
would
be
cautiously
and
sparingly
used
and
upon
vagrants
--
or
vagrancies
of
their
own
volition
and
this
has
been
reaffirmed
by
the
supreme
court
after
it
was
first
pronounced
in
1965.
this
particular
case
and
incidentally
your
honors
the
florida
supreme
court
has
in
previous
occasions
stricken
or
reversed
the
trial
courts
for
the
unconstitutional
application
of
this
particular
ordinance.
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
i
know
of
none
that
they
have
stricken
per
se
your
honor.
justice
ervin,
whom
i
consider
a
very
enlightened
jurist
--
our
supreme
court
has
acknowledged
that
certain
sections
of
the
vagrancy
statute
or
the
vagrancy
ordinance
have
simply
fallen
and
he
views
as
has
been
the
situation
in
hundreds
of
our
state
statutes
which
are
now
being
studied
and
being
revised
by
our
legislature
at
the
present
time.
he
acknowledges
in
one
of
his
opinions
that
gave
us
caution
and
guidance
in
this
area
that
the
--
if
the
facts
did
not
support
the
conviction,
if
the
court
should
not
hesitate
to
strike
him
down
it
may
unconstitutionally
apply.
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
your
honor,
i
assume
that
it
came
in
under
the
portion
of
the
ordinance
which
goes
to
wandering
and
strolling
about
from
place
to
place
without
unlawful
purpose.
i
think
the
idea
of
saying
that
a
vagrant
must
be
poor
or
that
this
is
applied
just
to
poor
people,
your
honor
is
not
the
intention
of
the
legislature
or
the
legislative
--
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
your
honor,
i
am
not
so
sure
that
--
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
your
honor
it
is
defined
down
through
this
--
let
me
say
this
and
i
am
not
evading
your
question,
this
language
was
in
existence.
in
an
answer
to
your
previous
question,
about
a
hundred
years
ago,
19
--
1880’s
--
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
yes
sir.
and
it
was
in
existence
when
the
--
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
yes
sir.
it
was
in
existence
before
the
--
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
well,
i
just
do
not
know
that
just
because
something
is
old
your
honor
that
it
is
bad.
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
is
old
and
--
we
went
through
black
law
dictionary,
we
went
through
webster’s
dictionary
and
words
and
phrases
and
we
have
no
trouble
defining
who
these
people
are.
and
we
think
that
they
are
--
or
advised
who
they
are.
now
i
would
be
--
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
no
sir,
your
honor.
that
would
be
--
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
i
think
that
would
be
an
unconstitutional
application
of
the
statute.
i
do
not
think
that
florida
would
hesitate
a
second
to
strike
it
down.
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
there
are
certain
parts
of
this
ordinance
that
have
incidentally
your
honor,
our
supreme
court
has
told
us
that
they
considered
unconstitutional
a
statute
that
made
a
person
explain
why
they
were
out
of
place
which
seems
to
be
the
model
penal
code's
approach
to
it
as
violative
of
the
fifth
amendment.
so
we
sort
of
do
not
know
what
to
do
and
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
florida
has
told
us
the
best
thing
we
have
is
the
vagrancy
statute
which
has
been
upheld
in
a
large
number
of
states
and
therefore
why
do
you
not
use
it
since
it
has
been
tried
and
tested.
but
it
did
not
delineate
or
pull
out
certain
words
that
should
have
been
omitted.
i
think
that
the
legislature,
i
would
be
first
to
--
i
had
been
candid
with
the
court
to
say
that
the
legislature
should
delete
some
of
these
words.
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
that
was
the
city
counsel
your
honor.
i
will
stipulate
that
some
of
the
words
should
come
out
of
the
ordinance.
and
i
think
legislatively
it
should
come
whether
or
not
the
entire
ordinance
goes
to
the
police
power
of
the
state,
the
very
heart
of
the
police
power
of
the
state
and
the
city
is
something
else
again
and
i
think
that
it
does.
but
let
me,
if
i
may
say
how
this
case
got
here.
we
have
a
very
fine
judge
on
our
circuit
court
bench
that
reviewed
this
case
when
it
was
brought
over
to
him
from
the
municipal
court.
the
only
thing
that
he
was
permitted
to
consider
was
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
on
its
face.
then
it
went
to
the
district
court
of
appeals
and
in
the
petitioner’s
brief
the
only
thing
he
asked
for
was
that
they
consider
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
on
its
face.
at
no
place
did
the
florida
court
get
to
look
at
these
facts.
i
will
be
candid
with
the
court.
they
have
made
allegations
here
that
they
are
not
even
under
the
ordinance
and
should
have
been
reversed
and
the
first
appellate
step
in
the
florida
appellate
structure
should
have
been
permitted
and
would
have
in
my
opinion
directed
the
municipal
court
to
straighten
that
out.
there
were
no
prosecutors
in
this
court
at
that
time.
and
they
go
in
and
it
is
an
unfortunate
situation
that
a
municipal
courts
run
the
way
they
did.
but
mr.
jacobson
makes
a
big
thing
out
of
900
and
some
vagrancy
arrests
this
year,
we
have
550,000
people
in
our
community.
that
is
approximately
three
a
day.
and
let
me
point
out
that
in
the
state
of
florida,
you
cannot
make
an
arrest
for
many,
many
of
the
things
that
are
mentioned
in
the
statute
unless
they
are
permitted
in
the
presence
of
the
officer,
only
authority.
if
it
is
a
misdemeanor
or
the
violation
of
municipal
ordinance,
if
the
officer
is
30
seconds
late,
he
is
required
to
go
around
to
a
magistrate
and
get
a
warrant.
so,
he
does
use
this
and
then
the
vagrancy
ordinance
and
then
the
charge
is
changed
as
is
often
the
case
in
the
administration
of
criminal
justice.
so
out
of
the
approximately
three
arrests
a
day,
many
of
them,
on
the
docket,
you
see,
the
next
morning
they
would
be
changed
although
the
arrest
was
vagrancy
because
he
was
30
seconds
late
in
getting
to
the
same
where
he
was
been
abroad
with
the
evidence
obvious
and
the
people
giving
the
officer
good
grounds
to
make
an
arrest
except
he
just
does
not
have
time
to
get
a
warrant.
and
it
is
a
very
practical
necessary
ordinance
for
the
maintenance
of
public
order
in
jacksonville,
florida.
just
because
it
is
old,
stipulating
that
the
legislature
should
strike
some
of
the
verdict.
just
because
it
is
old,
would
not
necessarily
seem
to
be
grounds
for
reversing
it.
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
your
honor
if
this
court
opens
the
door
to
the
florida
legislative
redrafting
session
we
today
are
now
going
into
by
simply
taking
from
the
first
court,
no
chance
to
look
at
the
facts.
district
court
of
appeal,
no
chance
to
look
at
the
fact
and
this
court
starts
looking
in
to
rewriting
the
florida
code,
we
will
find
about
200
statutes
that
need
to
have
the
language
updated.
and
this
is
no
exception.
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
i
respectfully
submit
your
honor
the
proper
function
--
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
yes
sir,
your
honor.
i
respectfully
submit
that
this
is
a
proper
function
for
the
legislature.
they
are
getting
to
it.
and
amazingly
they
are
getting
to
it
right
now
and
mr.
jacobson
is
here
to
redrafting
and
getting
our
code,
we
would
even
obtain
federal
funds
for
our
state
legislature
to
study
our
criminal
code
and
to
bring
it
up
to
date
and
to
get
rid
of
this
archaic
language.
but
i
submit
that
--
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
yes,
yes.
your
honor
i
have
absolutely
no
doubt,
i
am
general
counsel
for
the
city,
i
have
absolutely
no
doubt
that
when
some
guidance
comes
to
us
from
some
place
that
we
will
adopt
proper
language.
i
submit
that
in
studying
that
the
model
penal
code,
the
draft
of
1969,
that
some
scholar
drafted
that
it
will
probably
fall
from
constitutionality
because
it
permits
a
man
to
be
detained
for
20
minutes
just
because
he
acts
suspicious
and
so
i
do
not
know
--
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
and
in
those
places
where
the
archaic
language
appears,
if
it
is
a
policy
of
this
court,
i
would
stipulate
that
it
be
stricken,
if
that
is
the
policy
of
this
court.
i
do
not
think
it
is
before
this
court,
but
if
that
is
the
policy
of
this
court
i
will
stipulate
to
archaic
language
being
stricken.
i
think
the
next
case
before
you
is
very,
very
critical.
the
prowling
and
loitering
without
a
lawful
purpose
or
as
archaic
said
with
an
unlawful
purpose,
i
think
that
the
power
to
make
the
arrest
in
the
places
that
they
are
most
normally
made
and
incidentally
these
are
obviously
from
the
vast
number
of
cases,
the
worst
possible
factual
situations
that
could
have
gotten
before
this
court.
and
i
submit
that
the
florida
court
would
have
never
let
them
get
here.
it
would
have
been
reversed
immediately
by
the
district
court
of
appeals
because
they
do
not
even
charge
under
the
ordinance.
they
miss
the
ordinance
and
i
think
this
is
--
the
petitioner
is
asking
you
for
the
first
time.
this
court
in
a
florida
case
reversed
only
unconstitutional
application
in
johnson
in
1967,
reversed
on
the
unconstitutional
application
of
the
florida
vagrancy
statute
and
had
the
constitutionality
of
florida
vagrancy
statute
before
it.
now,
we
had
the
guidance
of
this
court,
we
had
the
guidance
of
the
florida
supreme
court
that
the
trial
judges
and
the
appellate
judges
would
reverse
on
the
unconstitutional
application
of
the
facts.
and
if
on
these
cases,
if
they
are
properly
before
you,
i
will
stipulate
that
they
were
not
unconstitutionally
applied.
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
no
sir.
no
sir
your
honor.
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
from
the
district
court
of
appeals
and
the
petitioner
said
the
only
issue
before
the
court
is
the
constitutionality
of
the
ordinance
on
its
face.
if
he
said
that
to
the
circuit
judge
who
sat
in
review
of
that
municipal
court.
he
has
never
asserted
that
these
facts
were
unconstitutionally
applied
which
has
been
the
law
of
this
court
and
of
the
florida
courts
in
this
area
in
the
last
few
years.
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
i
say
they
were
not
asked
to
do
that
--
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
you
are
asking
if
the
judge
will
go
beyond
the
request
relief
by
the
lawyer
when
he
goes
in
on
appeal.
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
your
honor,
our
interest
in
only
in
the
jacksonville
and
i
do
not
think
in
most
of
the
other
sections
of
the
country
work
that
way
if
a
lawyer
waives
all
the
points
except
one,
that
is
the
only
one
the
court
would
consider.
that
has
been
the
policy
of
this
court.
if
you
do
not
raise
you
should
waive
it.
and
this
was
all
that
was
submitted
and
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
of
appeals
from
which
certiorari
is
granted
here.
the
only
thing
that
the
court
points
out
in
that
opinion
that
the
only
thing
before
them
by
the
petition
which
the
petitioner
says.
the
only
thing
before
us
is
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
statute
on
its
face.
now
--
your
honor
i
will
submit
that
that
is
basically
unfair
that
the
florida
judiciary
did
not
give
him
a
chance
to
review
the
very
things
that
you
are
being
asked
to
review
these
cases
on
the
merits
--
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
it
should
have
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
reserve
that
point.
i
am
not
trying
to
evade
this
court
considering
this
case
but
i
think
i
have
a
duty
to
raise
it,
that
justice
holmes
said
that
if
he
did
not
come
in
from
the
proper
court
that
you
would
be
dismissed
but
this
case
came
from
the
district
court
of
appeals,
where
all
the
district
court
of
appeals
has
run
this.
it
was
review
in
certiorari.
so
if
you
are
reviewing
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
of
appeals
which
mr.
jacobson
has
asked
you
to
do,
you
are
merely
reviewing
whether
or
not
this
is
very
true
limited
--
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
the
first
district
court
of
appeals,
the
circuit
court
did
not
pass
on
the
merits.
they
simply
took
it.
they
gave
a
brief
opinion
that
the
statute
was
constitutional.
but
they
did
not
and
were
not
permitted
--
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
yes
sir,
but
they
were
not
permitted
to
look
at
the
facts.
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
yes
sir.
but
they
were
not
permitted
to
look
at
the
facts
--
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
the
writ
should
have
gone
back
to
the
original
court,
your
honor
to
the
circuit
court
which
was
the
court
that,
according
to
justice
holmes
that
the
petitioners
should
have
come
up
from.
that
was
the
court
that
entered
the
judgment,
the
district
court
of
appeals
merely
commented
that
the
statute
was
constitutional
but
denied
certiorari.
so
that
is
not
a
judgment
and
he
should
have
gone
from
here
--
since
he
came
from
the
wrong
court
and
justice
holmes
says
that
is
fake,
as
we
cited
that
in
our
brief.
i
would
like
to
submit
to
the
court
and
in
this
brief
time,
we
certainly
cannot
go
into
a
deep
alluded
philosophical
discussion
but
as
old
as
this
statute
is,
it
is
archaic,
as
some
of
the
language
is
the
very
important
law
enforcement
tool.
it
goes
to
the
very
heart
of
police
power
of
our
municipality
and
to
the
police
power
of
the
state
of
florida.
and
if
it
needs
to
be
revised
this
court
has
time
after
time
spoken
of
the
fact
that
it
will
not
strike
a
statute
if
it
can
be
construed
to
be
constitutional
but
it
must
be
beyond
any
reasonable
doubt
unconstitutional
and
the
fact
that
some
archaic
language
in
a
statute
does
not
make
it
unconstitutional
in
its
total
situation.
this
court
has
in
fact
held
that
it
has
a
duty
to
uphold
the
police
power
measure,
if
it
bears
some
rational
relationship
to
health,
safety,
morals
or
general
welfare
and
the
means
employed
reasonably
accomplishes
the
desired
result.
the
means
here
were
probably
an
unconstitutional
application
of
a
statute.
but
then
this
ordinance
read
in
its
totality
must
be
considered
and
i
honestly
submit
to
the
court,
must
be
considered
to
be
a
valid
exercise
of
the
police
power.
and
the
fact
it
is
not
inarticulately
drawn
is
immaterial
if
it
goes
to
the
relationship
of
health,
safety,
morals
and
general
welfare.
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
you
cannot
read
this
without
saying
that
it
goes
to
the
general
welfare,
the
public
safety.
i
could
give
you
a
list
of
illustrations.
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
no
sir.
i
think
we
have
to
--
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
the
civil
rights
act
that
was
sustained
back
in
the
'64
was
pretty
vague.
we
talk
in
terms
of
vagueness
your
honor,
i
do
not
mean
to
appear
to
be
flippant
but
and
i
am
not,
certainly
that
i
have
the
deepest
respect.
the
guidelines
laid
down
in
roth
for
example,
and
cited
in
our
brief,
the
reasonable
speed
of
many
words
that
just
defy
strict
definition
and
as
justice
frankfurter
pointed
out
on
a
number
of
occasions
that
this
balance
between
the
maintenance
of
public
order
and
criminal
conduct
and
drawing
words
and
language
broad
enough
to
protect
the
public
and
narrow
enough
to
protect
the
individual
is
what
it
is
all
about
and
it
is
really
--
there
is
no
handbook
on
legislative
drafting
that
this
will
be
constitutional
and
this
would
be
not.
this
is
a
tremendously
complex
difficult
area.
and
so
i
will
simply
submit
it
on
the
fact
that
it
is
not
unconstitutionally
vague
in
view
of
the
many
words,
that
this
court
has
held
to
be
constitutional,
not
constitutionally
vague.
and
our
brief
cites
many
illustrations
to
that.
there
must
be
a
place
on
reasonable
application
of
this
particular
ordinance
and
phrases
within
these
ordinance
where
it
would
be
held
to
be
constitutional
therefore
it
cannot
be
stricken
on
it
face
under
the
laws
or
under
the
rules
laid
down
by
this
court
because
in
many
provisions
of
it,
which
saved
it.
and
it
is
vital
to
the
protection
of
the
public
and
the
corporate
city,
the
consolidated
government
of
the
city
of
jacksonville.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
i
have
read
most
of
the
commentaries
of
mr.
jacobson,
my
brother
has
cited
to
the
court,
i
find
very
little
that
it
is
written
about
the
police.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
police
departments
today
in
the
metropolitan
areas
such
as
jacksonville,
florida
are
watched
by
the
media,
television,
news
paper,
they
are
watched
by
the
prosecutor,
they
are
watched
by
the
human
relations
committees,
they
are
watched
by
the
civil
liberties
union,
they
are
watched
by
the
sheriff
himself
because
he
is
the
elected
official.
we
have
one
police
department
in
our
government.
they
are
watched
by
the
executive
arm
of
the
government.
they
are
watched
by
the
courts.
if
they
have
come
in
with
bad
evidence,
if
they
make
any
illegal
search,
their
evidence
is
suppressed.
and
the
idea
that
there
is
hanging
over
jacksonville,
i
noticed
that
these
cases
were
very
selectively
brought
to
your
attention
that
there
is
hanging
over
jacksonville,
some
threat
of
the
police
power
taking
over
or
being
abused
is
manifestly
not
fair
to
the
functions
of
the
police
department.
we
have
a
thousand,
obviously
we
are
going
to
get
some
bad
outlets.
if
you
are
pouring
a
personal
reference
until
a
week
ago,
(inaudible)
prosecuted
a
bad
outlet.
but
to
say
that
they
are
all
bad
or
that
they
are
abusing
their
authority
perpetually
under
this
particular
ordinances
is
manifestly
unfair.
tree
arrest
a
day
in
a
city
of
550,000
people
cannot
be
a
wide,
broad
use
of
this
statute
when
you
are
considering
that
it
is
being
applied
in
order
that
some
arrest
can
be
made
that
could
not
otherwise
be
made
to
protect
the
public.
i
respectfully
submit
your
honors
that
the
crime
rate
of
the
united
states
has
grown
up
according
to
the
authority
cited
by
mr.
jacobson,
400%
in
the
last
25
years.
the
population
has
grown
up
50%.
we
have
not
been
able
to
keep
abreast
of
it
in
our
community.
43%
according
to
mr.
jacobson
are
people
in
his
authorities
are
afraid
to
walk
down
the
streets
at
night
alone
in
our
community.
we
need
to
modernize
our
ordinances
and
our
statutes
to
do
something
to
help
us
and
to
get
the
balance
back
in
the
administration
of
criminal
justice.
we
need
to
modernize
this
ordinance.
i
do
not
know
the
answer.
i
would
assume
that
the
people
of
florida
will
elect
people
who
can
make
those
decisions
with
the
advice
of
the
courts
that
they
will
make
the
decisions
or
rather
or
not
they
can
make
this
type
of
conduct
illegal.
and
that
those
people
that
they
elect
will
make
the
appropriate
decision
and
then
if
they
unconstitutionally
have
stepped
over
the
bounds
of
the
first
ten
amendments
which
justice
black
spoke
so
eloquently
about
then
they
are
stricken
down.
but
if
they
do
not
and
i
submit
that
there
is
not
a
single
thing
here
that
steps
over
the
bound
of
the
first
ten
amendments
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
or
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
you
are
being
asked
to
in
this
case
because
our
courts
did
not
have
an
opportunity
to
get
to
the
heart
of
this
matter.
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
t.
edward
austin,
jr.
i
suggest
that
the
long
line
of
cases
of
this
court
are
that
you
would
not
strike
any
portion
of
the
statute
that
is
constitutional
on
its
face
and
you
would
only
strike
those
provisions
which
were
unconstitutional
on
their
face.
so
yes
sir,
i
am
asking
you
if
you
are
going
to
do
something
with
it,
to
rewrite
it,
i
would
welcome
it.
it
has
given
me
and
the
people
who
seem
to
draft
these
things
have
headaches,
the
model
penal
code
which
i
would
refer
you
to
who
is
coming
in
for
how
rush
should
be
made
is
--
i
do
not
see
how
it
could
be
interpreted
any
differently
that
the
big
part
of
vagrancy
statute
is
applied.
the
police
officer
must
have
some
discretion
and
this
is
place
that
he
has
some.
and
if
you
have
changed
the
wordings,
he
is
still
is
going
to
have
some
discretion.
and
he
is
as
i
said
watched
night
and
day
by
all
of
these
authorities.
i
would
like
to
thank
the
court
for
considering
the
position
of
the
city
of
jacksonville
and
honestly
solicit
that
you
dismiss
this
writ
as
it
is
improper
to
granted
since
it
came
from
the
improper
court
and
further
to
construe
those
portions
of
the
statute,
if
you
can
construe
it
at
all
which
are
constitutional
to
be
constitutional.
thank
you
your
honors.
