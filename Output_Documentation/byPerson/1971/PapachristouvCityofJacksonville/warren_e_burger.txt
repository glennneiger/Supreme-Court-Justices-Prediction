chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
number
5030,
papachristou
against
jacksonville.
mr.
jacobson,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
this
ordinance
something
adopted
from
one
of
the
early
colonial
ordinances
or
from
something
in
england?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
contend
that
no
one
could
ever
be
convicted
lawfully,
constitutionally
for
any
act
under
this
ordinance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
do
not
know
what
a
common
drunkard
as
distinguished
from
an
uncommon
one
or
habitual
one
but
those
men
are
drunk
on
the
street
and
on
the
sidewalk
completely
in
a
coma,
could
he
be
arrested
under
the
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
could
he
be?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
that
be
invalid
as
applied
with
him.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
your
point
is,
you
do
not
have
that
here
because
it
is
not
that
specific.
you
do
not
know
what
it
means,
it
is
too
vague.
that
is
what
you
are
arguing,
is
it
not
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
then
the
more
he
gets
arrested
the
easier
it
is
to
sustain
the
charge
because
they
can
identify
him.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
makes
it
common
then
by
repetition
in
effects,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
in
the
archaic
language
used
in
this
ordinance
and
in
the
statute,
common
must
have
meant
at
the
time
that
it
was
originally
written
commonly
known
to
be
that
kind
of
a
person.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
there
is
common
drunkard.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh!
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
what
they
call
the
common
drunkard
in
that
day
is
an
alcoholic,
an
alcoholic
today,
men
constantly
getting
drunk.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
jacobson.
mr.
austin.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
has
it
ever
set
aside
any
of
these
ordinances
cast
in
archaic
terms?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
think
that
suggestions
about
the
age
of
the
statutes
and
the
ordinance
mr.
austin
are
directed
to
the
fact
that
it
was
using
terms
which
today
are
labeled
archaic
in
dictionaries
and
in
common
understanding.
i
do
not
think
anyone
is
concerned
about
its
age
per
se
that
only
that
it
uses
language
from
another
age.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
am
not
sure
i
understood
your
observation
about
that
the
florida
courts
would
have
stricken
this,
had
they
had
the
chance,
did
not
the
first
district
court
of
appeals
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
of
course,
that
court
did
it
have
the
option
to
reject
that
argument
and
say
that
it
was
unconstitutional
as
applied
in
this
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
did
it
have
the
option
to
do
so?
could
it
have
done
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
this
could
be
on
the
ground
if
he
granted
the
relief
as
to
this
particular
person
or
persons
before
you,
then
the
man
would
not
have
any
constitutional
claim
left
would
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
mr.
austin
when
a
case
like
this
comes
here
we
have
rather
a
limited
choices
and
the
first
we
cannot
give
declaratory
judgments
or
advisory
opinions
to
people
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
would
resume
after
lunch.
austin
you
have
just
finished.
mr.
jacobson
has
4
minutes,
no,
you
have
8
minutes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
in
jacksonville?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
it
is
not
subject
to
this
ordinance
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
in
the
city?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
didn't
understand
mr.
austin
that
the
argument
that
it
was
less
important
because
of
the
numbers
but
merely
making
the
point
that
there
was
no
wide
dragnet
that
was
dragging
in
thousands
of
people.
i
do
not
think
he
has
a
different
view
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
that
respect
as
you
do.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
jacobson.
thank
mr.
austin.
the
case
is
submitted.
