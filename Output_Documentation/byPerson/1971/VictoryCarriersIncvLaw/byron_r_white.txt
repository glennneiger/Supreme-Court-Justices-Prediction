justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
diamond,
would
your
position
mean
that
the
federal
law
of
admiralty
would
preempt
this
area
of
the
pier
as
long
as
the
activity
was
in
the
service
of
the
ship?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
state
law
then,
you
move
the
line
shoreward
and
within
that
area
and
within
the
area
of
that
activity,
there
would
no
cause
of
action
on
the
state
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that,
but
the
consequence
of
your
not
confining
it
would
be
to
preempt
state
law
in
some
respect?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
us
assume
that
law
had
--
that
there
is
a
defective
plank
in
the
pier
and
he
was
walking
along,
he
just
got
off
the
forklift
and
fell
in
the
hole
in
the
pier.
would
you
make
the
same
argument
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
ship
is
responsible
for
the
pier?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
ship
is
responsible
for
the
pier
that
it
ties
up
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
us
assume
that
law
was
riding
along
on
his
forklift,
this
forklift
that
he
was
run
into
by
another
forklift,
run
by
another
longshoreman
loading
another
ship?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
operational
negligence,
the
seaworthiness
just
does
not
reach
it,
is
that
your
view?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
say
that
would
be
a
state
law
matter?
it
could
not
be
a
jones
act,
it
could
not
be
hamburg
and
maritime
negligence
action,
could
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
have
got
this,
sort
of
depending
on
what
kind
of
an
accident
he
had
on
piers
and
what
was
the
governing
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
would
not
it
be
the
negligence
of
the
vessel?
i
mean,
if
the
pier
is
the
ship's
responsibility
and
the
ship
has
an
obligation
to
provide
a
safe
place
to
work,
why
should
not
it
be
responsible
for
mere
negligence
on
the
pier
by
a
third
party?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
is
your
answer
then,
i
mean,
that
is
the
answer
you
say
rather
than
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
not
still
say
maritime
law
applies,
but
it
just
does
not
give
a
remedy
to
that
kind
of
negligence,
but
the
answer
would
be
then
also
that
the
state
law
could
not
supply
the
remedy
because
it
is
within
the
area
of
maritime
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
we
are
back
to
twilight
zone
days?
justice
byron
r.
white
another
reason
for
the
rule
was
that
seaman
is
rather
helpless?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
the
sailor
was
obviously
helpless,
how
about
the
longshoreman?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
have
rather
strong
bargaining
position,
do
they
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
only
if
they
need
to
sustain
the
(inaudible)
customarily
as
whether
state
or
federal
law
provide
a
remedy.
i
do
not
fully
see
that
the
state
remedy
was
equivalent
as
the
remedy
of
maritime
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
surely
in
this
instance
the
ship
is
not
going
to
invest
paying
the
bill
anyway?
justice
byron
r.
white
according
to
state
law
the
relationship
between
the
stevedore
and
its
employer
is
governed
by
the
workers'
compensation?
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
an
amendment
preempts
out
of
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
longshoreman's
act
does
not
cover
the
state
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
