mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
mr.
justice
douglas,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
a
vessel
of
warranty
of
seaworthiness
extends
to
a
forklift
machine
which
is
operated
explicitly
upon
the
dock
by
an
operator
who
does
go
aboard
the
vessel
and
who
is
injured
by
reason
of
some
defect
or
fault
in
the
lift
machine
as
opposed
to
any
part
of
the
vessel,
its
gear
or
personnel
causing
the
accident.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
not
in
serious
dispute
and
are
relatively
simple.
the
respondent
bill
law
who
was
an
employee,
a
petitioner,
gulf
stevedore
corporation,
was
operating
a
forklift
machine
on
the
dock
moving
a
cargo
of
airplane
landing
match
from
the
dockside
storage
point
to
a
point
approximately
–-
to
a
point
along
side
the
vessel
where
he
would
put
them
down
and
they
would
subsequently
be
loaded
on
board
the
vessel.
when
mr.
law
was
approximately
50
feet
away
from
the
vessel
on
the
dock,
the
overhead
protection
rack
or
as
the
longshoreman
commonly
referred
to
it
as
the
headache
rack
became
loose
and
struck
him
on
the
back
of
his
head.
now,
there
is
no
question
but
none
of
the
vessel’s
gear
or
its
equipment
or
cargo
caused
the
rack
become
loose.
it
fell
because
of
some
defect
within
the
rack.
however,
the
district
court
did
not
consider
whether
it
was
defective
or
not
to
be
determitive
or
material
to
the
question
presented
because
after
mr.
law’s
deposition
was
taken,
all
parties
moved
for
summary
judgment
in
their
flavor.
the
vessel
and
stevedore
that
was
impleaded
by
the
vessel
and
also
the
plaintiff,
longshoreman
himself.
the
district
court
granted
the
summary
judgment
motion
of
the
vessel
and
of
the
stevedore
and
denied
the
motion
of
plaintiff.
and
on
appeal,
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeal
reversed
and
held
that
mr.
law
was
in
the
service
of
the
vessel
that
the
lift
machine
was
in
fact
in
appurtenance
of
the
vessel
although
it
was
not
used
on
the
vessel.
and
that
mr.
law
was
therefore
entitled
to
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness.
now,
the
appellate
court
made
no
consideration
of
the
extension
of
admiralty
jurisdiction
act
and
as
the
respondent
has
pointed
out
in
this
brief,
this
issue
was
not
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals
until
the
time
of
oral
argument
and
then
again
after
the
ruling
in
the
petition
for
a
rehearing
which
was
denied
by
the
lower
court.
one
of
the
reasons
it
was
not
raised
was
because
of
some
question
as
to
exactly
what
the
extension
of
admiralty
jurisdiction
act
meant.
the
--
after
briefs
were
filed
in
this
case
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
before
the
court’s
opinion
came
out,
this
court
decided
nacirema
operating
company
versus
johnson
which
admittedly
was
concerned
with
the
question
of
whether
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers'
act
extended
to
an
injury
which
occurred
on
the
dock.
there
the
court
discussed
the
extension
act
and
said
that
there
is
much
to
be
said
but
a
uniform
treatment
of
longshoreman
injured
while
loading
or
unloading
the
ship.
but
even
construing
the
extension
act
to
amend
the
longshoreman’s
act
would
not
affect
this
result
since
the
longshoreman
injured
on
the
pier
by
pier-based
equipment
would
still
remain
outside
the
act.
now,
in
gutierrez
versus
waterman,
this
court
also
considered
the
extension
act
and
concluded
there
that
there
was
maritime
jurisdiction
under
the
act
when
the
ship
owner
committed
a
tort
while
the
ship
was
being
unloaded
and
the
impact
of
that
tort
was
still
ashore,
at
the
time
and
place
not
remote
from
the
act.
if
the
court
will
remember,
gutierrez
involved
defective
containers,
their
bean
bags
was
permitted,
beans
to
be
spilled
out
onto
the
dock
as
they
were
being
discharged.
the
court
concluded
that
the
act
of
the
vessel
was
its
defective
cargo
containers
and
this
was
felt
ashore
and
caused
the
injury.
that
case
is
understandable,
but
in
our
case,
the
vessel
played
no
part
in
the
plaintiff’s
injury
as
he
was
injured
solely
on
the
dock
by
this
shore-based
equipment
which
never
went
aboard
the
vessel.
now,
there
is
one
question
and
i
will
get
into
this
as
part
of
the
other
argument
as
to
--
if
in
fact
the
lift
machine
became
an
appurtenance
of
the
vessel,
if
in
fact
it
was
defective,
then
would
it
not
come
on
to
the
extension
act.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
this
lift
machine
never
became
an
appurtenance
of
this
vessel
or
severally
there
is
a
--
well,
let
me
back
up
just
for
minute
because
the
fifth
circuit
said
that
the
lift
machine
became
an
appurtenance
of
the
vessel
relying
on
this
court’s
decisions
of
alaska
steamship
company
versus
petterson.
whereas
where
this
court
held
that
when
the
stevedore
brings
equipment
aboard
the
vessel
to
be
used
in
the
discharging,
the
loading
operation,
it
becomes
an
integral
part
of
the
ship’s
equipment
and
if
it
is
defective
then
the
vessel
was
responsible
for
it.
alright,
subsequent
lower
court
decisions,
the
deffes
versus
federal
barge
lines
case
out
of
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
a
marine
leg
that
was
shore
based
and
ran
into
a
barge,
if
it
was
defective,
then
that
made
the
barge
defective.
the
ninth
circuit
in
huff
versus
matson,
the
third
circuit
in
spann
versus
lauritzen
has
held
similarly.
but
in
all
of
those
cases,
there
was
involved
gantries
or
conveyors
or
(inaudible)
or
something
that
connected
the
vessel
with
the
shore-based
equipment.
in
our
case,
there
was
nothing
to
connect
the
lift
machine
with
the
vessel.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
yes,
it
would
have
to
be,
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
believe
that
--
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
no
sir.
i
believe
that
is
the
lift
machine
ran
up
onto
the
vessel.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
on
the
shore.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
on
the
water.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
yes,
i
think
that
it
would
be
different,
and
i
think
that
it
would
be
different
because
first
off,
i
do
not
think
the
lift
machine
was
--
ever
became
aboard
of
this
vessel.
that
there
is
a
split
of
authority
between
the
circuit
courts,
between,
i
believe
it
is
the
second
and
sixth
circuits
have
held
that
this
type
of
equipment
was
never
intended
to
be
on
the
vessel
and
other
courts
have
said
no,
this
is
to
find
a
line.
that
it
is
included
and
that
you
cannot
escape
the
responsibility
because
you
choose
to
use
a
more
dignified
or
improved
type
of
equipment.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
i
am
coming
to
that
(voice
overlap)
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
yes
sir.
i
am
coming
--
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
yes
sir,
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
am
coming
to
that
thought
of
my
argument,
i
have
categorically
argued
it
down
to
the
shore-based
equipment
and
whether
or
not
the
individual
was
in
the
service
of
the
ship.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
the
fifth
circuit
reached
--
had
to
reach
both
of
these
conclusions.
and
we
submit
that
in
both
respects
it
was
wrong
with
regards
to
both
the
shore-based
equipment
and
as
to
the
individual
being
in
the
service
of
the
vessel.
if,
before
i
get
to
respond
to
your
question
mr.
justice
stewart,
if
this
lift
machine
which
never
went
aboard
this
vessel
as
hailed
to
be
an
appurtenance
of
the
vessel,
we
respectfully
submit
that
any
equipment
or
means
of
conveyance
that
is
bringing
cargo
to
a
vessel
or
subsequent
loading
will
be
held
to
be
within
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness,
the
hypothetical
fears,
they
were
expressed
in
gutierrez,
come
closer
and
closer
to
reality.
there
is
a
very
recent
case
out
of
the
eastern
district
pennsylvania,
which
i
have
cited
in
supplemental
brief
of
the
mcneil
versus
the
a/s
havtor,
i
believe,
to
show
just
how
far
this
doctrine
now
goes.
in
that
case,
the
forklift
driver
was
working
exclusively
in
a
warehouse.
he
would
pick
up
palettes
and
set
them
in
another
position
in
the
warehouse
and
from
there
other
longshoreman
would
come
in
with
a
lift
machine,
stick
it
up,
take
it
out
along
aside
the
ship.
he
was
injured
when
he
ran
over
some
undetermined
defect
on
the
warehouse
floor
which
caused
the
steering
wheel
not
to
spin
and
hit
his
ribs.
the
court
said
that
he
was
in
service
of
the
ship
but
the
forklift
machine
that
was
used
entirely
within
the
warehouse
was
an
appurtenance
of
the
vessel
and
relying
on
this
case,
held
and
also
the
fifth
circuit
case
of
chagois
versus
lykes
bros.
held
that
he
was
within
the
warranty
and
extended
to
them
the
warrant.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
no
sir.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
yes
sir.
under
the
national
--
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
yes
sir.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
the
state
workmen's
compensation
act
did
apply.
yes.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
yes
sir.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
well,
the
question
is,
can
he
sue
this
vessel
upon
seaworthiness?
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
yes.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
that
is
correct,
yes.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
you
mean
the
indemnity
action
over
him,
yes,
well
it
is
quite
--
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
if
they
would
breach,
but
if,
as
a
practical
matter
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
if
it
please
the
court,
the
stevedore
really
has
no
alternative,
but
because
here
is
his
lift
machine,
it
is
his
lift
machine
on
the
dock,
if
it
is
defective,
certainly
nothing
can
be
attributed
to
the
ship.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
the
conduit
after
which
the
(voice
overlap)
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
yes.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
yes.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
he
has
been.
has
he
been
paid?
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
there
has
been
no
award,
but
he
has
been
paid.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
but
now
as
the
court
can
see
under
the
decision
of
victory
law,
of
victory
carriers
versus
bill
law,
the
vessel
assumes
a
passive
secondary
role
in
extending
this
seaworthiness
warranty.
conceivably
a
vessel
not
even
yet
at
the
dock
could
be
held
unseaworthy,
if
these
men
are
out
moving
the
cargo
in
preparation
for
the
loading
of
the
vessel
or
if
the
vessel
has
already
left
and
they
are
still
moving
the
cargo
from
the
dock
into
the
warehouse.
the
court
has
simply
pushed
the
vessel
aside
and
really
in
this
case,
i
respectfully
submit
the
vessel’s
only
association
with
this
accident
was
the
fact
that
she
lay
along
side
the
pier.
now,
there
is
the
one
other
question
of
was
mr.
law
in
the
service
of
the
ship?
i
respectfully
submit
there
is
no
justification
for
extending
the
strict
and
rigid
standard
of
seaworthiness
to
persons
similarly
situated
as
respondent
mr.
law
in
this
case.
the
appellate
court
found
that
he
was
intimately
involved
in
loading
process
and
was
subjected
to
the
perils
and
the
households
of
the
sea.
in
mahnich
versus
southern
steamship
company,
this
court
said
the
justification
for
the
rigid
standard
of
seaworthiness
as
to
a
seaman,
let
us
say,
through
blue
going
to
a
sea
seaman,
he
subject
to
the
rigorous
discipline
of
the
sea
and
all
the
conditions
of
this
service
constrain
him
to
accept
without
critical
examination
and
without
protest
working
conditions
and
appliances
as
commanded
by
his
superior
officers.
this
was
the
reason
given
for,
or
the
justification
for
setting
a
strict,
rigid
standard
of
unseaworthiness.
and
sieracki,
where
the
seaworthiness
warranty
was
given
to
the
longshoreman
who
was
aboard,
loading
and
unloading.
the
court
said
that
loading
and
unloading
was
within
the
perils
and
hazards
to
which
a
seaman
works
for.
but
here,
this
respondent
in
driving
this
forklift
truck
on
the
dock
was
no
more
subjected
to
the
perils
and
hazards
of
the
sea
than
any
forklift
operator
in
any
warehouse
in
the
united
states.
is
he
just
happened
to
be
one
step
closer
to
the
movement
of
this
cargo,
he
would
move
it
one
point
where
it
would
be
set
down
and
subsequently
loaded
aboard
the
vessel.
those
individuals
who
are
operating
forklift
machines
in
other
locations,
in
other
warehouses
have
certainly
not
been
extended
any
shield
of
protection
similar
to
the
shield
given
to
longshoreman
on
board
vessels
or
to
seaman
who
are
subjected
to
the
hazards
and
perils
of
the
sea.
now,
we
do
not
contend
that
mr.
law
was
not
performing
some
service
for
this
vessel.
but
he
was
performing
normal
service
for
this
vessel
than
enumerable
other
people,
would
perform
to
prepare
a
vessel
for
her
voyage.
i
believe
this
is
what
the
district
court
said.
and
also
the
district
court
said
that
somewhere
there
had
to
be
a
beginning
to
this
loading
process
and
somewhere
there
had
to
be
an
ending.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
thank
you
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
can
continue
with
my
argument
of
yesterday,
we
submit
that
there
must
be
a
beginning
and
an
ending
to
the
loading
and
discharging
process
insofar
as
the
obligation
of
a
vessel's
warranty
of
seaworthiness
is
concerned.
this
is
necessary
for
the
guidance
of
litigants
as
well
as
for
the
law
of
course.
what
started
principally
as
the
humanitarian
policy
by
this
court
in
sieracki
to
include
those
shore-based
workers
on
a
vessel,
who
were
performing
work,
traditionally
performed
by
seamen
within
the
strict
and
rigid
warranty
of
seaworthiness
has
now
been
taken
onto
the
pier
and
extended
to
the
shore-based
worker
who
is
operating
exclusive
shore-based
equipment
and
as
i
stated
yesterday,
in
recent
case
of
mcneil
has
even
been
carried
into
the
warehouse.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
the
mcneil
case
was
out
of
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania.
it
was
within
the
past
2-3
months,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
yes,
in
supplemental
brief
which
we
filed.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
it
was
a
district
court
opinion
sir.
there
must
be
a
limit
to
the
extent
of
the
vessel's
warranty.
we
submit
that
the
limits
imposed
by
the
district
court
in
this
case
are
both
realistic
and
reasonable,
that
is
that
loading
of
cargo
insofar
as
the
vessel's
warranty
is
concerned,
commences
when
the
vessels
tackle
becomes
a
tax
to
the
cargo
and
that
unloading
terminates
when
the
cargo
is
landed
on
to
dock
or
into
a
vehicle
into
which
it
is
being
discharged.
this
has
long
been
the
test
of
liability
as
between
a
ship
and
shipper,
often
referred
to
tackle
to
tackle.
such
a
limitation
does
no
offense
to
sieracki
or
to
peterson
or
to
the
gutierrez's
case,
because
the
dockside
worker
who
is
actually
injured
by
the
ship's
own
gear,
equipment,
cargo
containers,
arch
crew,
would
still
remain
within
the
warranty.
the
circuit
court
below
in
this
case
held
that
the
district
court's
limitation
of
the
warranty
represented
a
minority
view
which
defined
the
loading
in
an
exceedingly
narrow
and
mechanical
fashion
and
chose
to
align
itself
with
other
cases,
which
define
loading
and
unloading
code
in
a
realistic
sense
rather
than
hypothetical
terms
of
art.
in
so
holding,
the
court
of
appeals
below
has
in
effect
completely
disregarded
the
basis
upon
which
the
seaworthiness
doctrine
is
premised,
that
is
to
afford
protection
to
those
individuals
who
are
subjected
to
the
rigorous
discipline
of
the
sea,
going
back
to
mehnich
v.
southern
steamship
company.
further,
the
court
below
as
we
are
argued
yesterday,
disregarded
the
extension
of
admiralty
jurisdiction
act.
we
would
invite
the
court's
attention
to
the
opinion
of
judge
watkins
in
a
recent
case
from
the
district
court
of
maryland
which
is
greene
(ph)
versus
pope
&
talbot,
we
have
also
cited
in
our
supplemental
brief,
where
after
he
gives
a
historical
discussion
of
the
seaworthiness
doctrine,
commence
on
this
bill
law
case
in
chagois
versus
lykes
brothers
and
the
ninth
circuit
case
of
gilbert
versus
the
hawaiian
legislature
and
after
saying
what
those
cases
hold,
if
i
may
quote,
“this
liability
without
theory
ignores
the
situs
of
the
injury,
ignores
causation,
ignores
whether
realistically
the
ship
is
being
loaded
or
unloaded
and
ignores
the
true
status
of
the
injured
party.
now,
last
term
in
the
case
of
usner
v.
luckenbach
overseas
corporation,
this
court
held
that
it
would
be
erroneous
when
no
condition
of
unseaworthiness
existed
to
hold
the
ship
on
a
liable
for
third
party
single
and
wholly
unforeseeable
act
of
negligence.
we
submit
that
similar
logic
and
reasoning
suggest
to
conclusion
that
a
shipowner
and
his
vessel
should
not
be
held
liable
for
an
accident
which
occurs
solely
on
the
dock
as
a
result
of
exclusively
shore-based
defective
equipment,
which
is
being
used
for
the
purpose
of
moving
or
shifting
cargo
on
the
dock
and
over
which
the
vessel
has
no
control.
the
justification
for
the
imposition
of
the
unseaworthiness
doctrine
with
its
rigid
standard
is
absent
under
the
facts
of
this
case.
as
i
stated
yesterday,
unless
the
law
under
the
facts
of
this
case
was
not
subject
to
the
perils
and
hazards
of
a
sea
nor
was
his
lift
machine
that
he
was
operating
in
appurtenance
of
this
vessel,
we
are
not
suggesting
a
reversal
of
gutierrez
case
because
there
there
was
actual
vessel
involvement
in
that
dockside
injury.
we
do
urge
that
a
limitation
be
placed
on
the
extension
of
the
seaworthiness
warranty
by
limiting
the
principles
which
are
set
forth
in
gutierrez
to
those
instances
where
the
vessel
itself,
its
own
gears,
own
equipment,
has
caused
the
shore-side
injury,
rather
than
shore-based
equipment
over
which
the
vessel
has
absolutely
no
control.
before
i
sit
down
i
would
like
to
say
i
understand
that
probably
it
was
friday,
the
american
trial
lawyers
association
has
filed
the
motion
for
an
amicus
curiae
brief
in
this
case,
i
have
not
seen
it,
i
am
not
in
a
position
to
make
any
response
to
it.
i
do
not
know
what
the
court's
action
would
be
on
it,
but
we
would
respectfully
submit
that
the
fifth
circuit
has
gone
beyond
the
holdings
of
this
court
in
extending
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness
out
on
to
the
dock
to
this
shore
based
equipment
that
if
limitations
and
guidelines
are
not
placed,
we
believe
that
the
hypothetical
situations
which
the
court
expressed
in
gutierrez
which
the
court
below
says,
we
do
not
reach
this
particular
type
of
situation,
however,
it
does
leave
the
door
open
by
saying
we
will
reach
that
case
when
it
comes
before
us.
i
respectfully
submit
that
for
the
reasons
it
was
stated
the
first
circuit
has
erred
and
suggest
and
request
that
be
reversed.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
yes
sir.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
yes
sir
and
i
believe
--
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
yes.
yes
sir,
i
am
told
that
--
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
the
court
denied
the
motion
for
leave
to
file
the
amicus
curiae
brief
on
behalf
of
the
maritime
committee.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
yes.
it
was
denied
and
i
understand
that
either
friday
or
perhaps
yesterday
the
american
trial
lawyers
filed
the
motion
for
an
amicus
curiae
brief.
i
have
not
seen
it
and
had
no
opportunity
to
review
it.
i
do
not
think
this
court
has
ruled
on
that
brief.
thank
you.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
i
would
take
a
couple
of
minutes,
if
i
may
your
honor.
i
am
going
to
take
up
on
the
last
question
of
who
must
bear
the
cost.
the
court
would
recall
that
the
longshoremen
harbor
workers'
act
was
passed
so
that
the
injured
longshoreman
would
have
his
remedy
for
the
vessel
side
or
the
water
side
of
the
dock.
now,
the
court
has
held
that
this
is
the
longshoreman's
exclusive
remedy
against
his
employer,
is
under
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers'
act.
i
think
the
court
has
in
its
questions
touched
on
the
problem
that
we
have
here.
as
a
practical
matter,
mr.
law
got
his
employer
where
if
he
prevails
here
would
pay
whatever
he
receives
that
is
sometimes
in
the
industry
known
as
two
bites
from
the
apple.
he
had
one
bite
for
his
compensation,
he
then
brings
his
action
against
the
vessel
for
this
shore-side
injury.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
no
sir,
there
has
not
been
a
claim
for
that.
it
was
voluntarily
paid
under
the
alabama
state
compensation
act.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
the
longshoremen
harbor
workers'
act
under
nacirema
would
not
apply
to
this
type
of
thing,
as
it
happened
on
the
dock.
mr.
diamond
spoke
of
the
survey
of
the
dangerous
type
of
work
that
longshoremen
do.
as
i
recall
reading
the
yale
law
journal
article,
says
with
the
possible
exception
of
logging
and
other
industries
to
discuss
all
type
of
construction,
heavy
labor,
any
type
of
work
where
man
is
exposed
to
walking
the
beams
of
constructing
buildings,
on
the
dock,
whatever
he
maybe
doing
is
dangerous
work.
nowhere
under
any
as
the
law
as
any
workmen
given
the
shield
of
protection
as
a
longshoreman
has
been
given
specially
in
this
case
here
as
exclusively
on
the
docket.
the
court
would
recall
the
pope
&
talbot
versus
hawn,
teaches
us
this
is
not
the
label
that
we
put
on
the
man
where
these
longshoreman
with
the
type
of
work
that
he
is
doing.
the
one
other
point
that
you
said
was
not
in
the
record,
the
record
does
state
that
in
response
to
questions
on
page
91
that
where
he
got
those
forklift
machines,
he
said
he
picked
it
up
at
the
garage,
at
gus
garage
that
morning
and
drove
it
down
to
the
vessel
to
start
his
work.
i
do
not
know
where
it
was
the
day
before.
again
i
would
respectfully
submit
the
court
below
has
extended
the
doctrine
too
far
and
request
this
court
to
place
limitations
by
reversing
the
court
below.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
mr.
justice
douglas,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
a
vessel
of
warranty
of
seaworthiness
extends
to
a
forklift
machine
which
is
operated
explicitly
upon
the
dock
by
an
operator
who
does
go
aboard
the
vessel
and
who
is
injured
by
reason
of
some
defect
or
fault
in
the
lift
machine
as
opposed
to
any
part
of
the
vessel,
its
gear
or
personnel
causing
the
accident.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
not
in
serious
dispute
and
are
relatively
simple.
the
respondent
bill
law
who
was
an
employee,
a
petitioner,
gulf
stevedore
corporation,
was
operating
a
forklift
machine
on
the
dock
moving
a
cargo
of
airplane
landing
match
from
the
dockside
storage
point
to
a
point
approximately
–-
to
a
point
along
side
the
vessel
where
he
would
put
them
down
and
they
would
subsequently
be
loaded
on
board
the
vessel.
when
mr.
law
was
approximately
50
feet
away
from
the
vessel
on
the
dock,
the
overhead
protection
rack
or
as
the
longshoreman
commonly
referred
to
it
as
the
headache
rack
became
loose
and
struck
him
on
the
back
of
his
head.
now,
there
is
no
question
but
none
of
the
vessel’s
gear
or
its
equipment
or
cargo
caused
the
rack
become
loose.
it
fell
because
of
some
defect
within
the
rack.
however,
the
district
court
did
not
consider
whether
it
was
defective
or
not
to
be
determitive
or
material
to
the
question
presented
because
after
mr.
law’s
deposition
was
taken,
all
parties
moved
for
summary
judgment
in
their
flavor.
the
vessel
and
stevedore
that
was
impleaded
by
the
vessel
and
also
the
plaintiff,
longshoreman
himself.
the
district
court
granted
the
summary
judgment
motion
of
the
vessel
and
of
the
stevedore
and
denied
the
motion
of
plaintiff.
and
on
appeal,
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeal
reversed
and
held
that
mr.
law
was
in
the
service
of
the
vessel
that
the
lift
machine
was
in
fact
in
appurtenance
of
the
vessel
although
it
was
not
used
on
the
vessel.
and
that
mr.
law
was
therefore
entitled
to
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness.
now,
the
appellate
court
made
no
consideration
of
the
extension
of
admiralty
jurisdiction
act
and
as
the
respondent
has
pointed
out
in
this
brief,
this
issue
was
not
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals
until
the
time
of
oral
argument
and
then
again
after
the
ruling
in
the
petition
for
a
rehearing
which
was
denied
by
the
lower
court.
one
of
the
reasons
it
was
not
raised
was
because
of
some
question
as
to
exactly
what
the
extension
of
admiralty
jurisdiction
act
meant.
the
--
after
briefs
were
filed
in
this
case
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
before
the
court’s
opinion
came
out,
this
court
decided
nacirema
operating
company
versus
johnson
which
admittedly
was
concerned
with
the
question
of
whether
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers'
act
extended
to
an
injury
which
occurred
on
the
dock.
there
the
court
discussed
the
extension
act
and
said
that
there
is
much
to
be
said
but
a
uniform
treatment
of
longshoreman
injured
while
loading
or
unloading
the
ship.
but
even
construing
the
extension
act
to
amend
the
longshoreman’s
act
would
not
affect
this
result
since
the
longshoreman
injured
on
the
pier
by
pier-based
equipment
would
still
remain
outside
the
act.
now,
in
gutierrez
versus
waterman,
this
court
also
considered
the
extension
act
and
concluded
there
that
there
was
maritime
jurisdiction
under
the
act
when
the
ship
owner
committed
a
tort
while
the
ship
was
being
unloaded
and
the
impact
of
that
tort
was
still
ashore,
at
the
time
and
place
not
remote
from
the
act.
if
the
court
will
remember,
gutierrez
involved
defective
containers,
their
bean
bags
was
permitted,
beans
to
be
spilled
out
onto
the
dock
as
they
were
being
discharged.
the
court
concluded
that
the
act
of
the
vessel
was
its
defective
cargo
containers
and
this
was
felt
ashore
and
caused
the
injury.
that
case
is
understandable,
but
in
our
case,
the
vessel
played
no
part
in
the
plaintiff’s
injury
as
he
was
injured
solely
on
the
dock
by
this
shore-based
equipment
which
never
went
aboard
the
vessel.
now,
there
is
one
question
and
i
will
get
into
this
as
part
of
the
other
argument
as
to
--
if
in
fact
the
lift
machine
became
an
appurtenance
of
the
vessel,
if
in
fact
it
was
defective,
then
would
it
not
come
on
to
the
extension
act.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
this
lift
machine
never
became
an
appurtenance
of
this
vessel
or
severally
there
is
a
--
well,
let
me
back
up
just
for
minute
because
the
fifth
circuit
said
that
the
lift
machine
became
an
appurtenance
of
the
vessel
relying
on
this
court’s
decisions
of
alaska
steamship
company
versus
petterson.
whereas
where
this
court
held
that
when
the
stevedore
brings
equipment
aboard
the
vessel
to
be
used
in
the
discharging,
the
loading
operation,
it
becomes
an
integral
part
of
the
ship’s
equipment
and
if
it
is
defective
then
the
vessel
was
responsible
for
it.
alright,
subsequent
lower
court
decisions,
the
deffes
versus
federal
barge
lines
case
out
of
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
a
marine
leg
that
was
shore
based
and
ran
into
a
barge,
if
it
was
defective,
then
that
made
the
barge
defective.
the
ninth
circuit
in
huff
versus
matson,
the
third
circuit
in
spann
versus
lauritzen
has
held
similarly.
but
in
all
of
those
cases,
there
was
involved
gantries
or
conveyors
or
(inaudible)
or
something
that
connected
the
vessel
with
the
shore-based
equipment.
in
our
case,
there
was
nothing
to
connect
the
lift
machine
with
the
vessel.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
yes,
it
would
have
to
be,
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
believe
that
--
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
no
sir.
i
believe
that
is
the
lift
machine
ran
up
onto
the
vessel.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
on
the
shore.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
on
the
water.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
yes,
i
think
that
it
would
be
different,
and
i
think
that
it
would
be
different
because
first
off,
i
do
not
think
the
lift
machine
was
--
ever
became
aboard
of
this
vessel.
that
there
is
a
split
of
authority
between
the
circuit
courts,
between,
i
believe
it
is
the
second
and
sixth
circuits
have
held
that
this
type
of
equipment
was
never
intended
to
be
on
the
vessel
and
other
courts
have
said
no,
this
is
to
find
a
line.
that
it
is
included
and
that
you
cannot
escape
the
responsibility
because
you
choose
to
use
a
more
dignified
or
improved
type
of
equipment.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
i
am
coming
to
that
(voice
overlap)
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
yes
sir.
i
am
coming
--
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
yes
sir,
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
am
coming
to
that
thought
of
my
argument,
i
have
categorically
argued
it
down
to
the
shore-based
equipment
and
whether
or
not
the
individual
was
in
the
service
of
the
ship.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
the
fifth
circuit
reached
--
had
to
reach
both
of
these
conclusions.
and
we
submit
that
in
both
respects
it
was
wrong
with
regards
to
both
the
shore-based
equipment
and
as
to
the
individual
being
in
the
service
of
the
vessel.
if,
before
i
get
to
respond
to
your
question
mr.
justice
stewart,
if
this
lift
machine
which
never
went
aboard
this
vessel
as
hailed
to
be
an
appurtenance
of
the
vessel,
we
respectfully
submit
that
any
equipment
or
means
of
conveyance
that
is
bringing
cargo
to
a
vessel
or
subsequent
loading
will
be
held
to
be
within
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness,
the
hypothetical
fears,
they
were
expressed
in
gutierrez,
come
closer
and
closer
to
reality.
there
is
a
very
recent
case
out
of
the
eastern
district
pennsylvania,
which
i
have
cited
in
supplemental
brief
of
the
mcneil
versus
the
a/s
havtor,
i
believe,
to
show
just
how
far
this
doctrine
now
goes.
in
that
case,
the
forklift
driver
was
working
exclusively
in
a
warehouse.
he
would
pick
up
palettes
and
set
them
in
another
position
in
the
warehouse
and
from
there
other
longshoreman
would
come
in
with
a
lift
machine,
stick
it
up,
take
it
out
along
aside
the
ship.
he
was
injured
when
he
ran
over
some
undetermined
defect
on
the
warehouse
floor
which
caused
the
steering
wheel
not
to
spin
and
hit
his
ribs.
the
court
said
that
he
was
in
service
of
the
ship
but
the
forklift
machine
that
was
used
entirely
within
the
warehouse
was
an
appurtenance
of
the
vessel
and
relying
on
this
case,
held
and
also
the
fifth
circuit
case
of
chagois
versus
lykes
bros.
held
that
he
was
within
the
warranty
and
extended
to
them
the
warrant.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
no
sir.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
yes
sir.
under
the
national
--
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
yes
sir.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
the
state
workmen's
compensation
act
did
apply.
yes.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
yes
sir.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
well,
the
question
is,
can
he
sue
this
vessel
upon
seaworthiness?
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
yes.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
that
is
correct,
yes.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
you
mean
the
indemnity
action
over
him,
yes,
well
it
is
quite
--
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
if
they
would
breach,
but
if,
as
a
practical
matter
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
if
it
please
the
court,
the
stevedore
really
has
no
alternative,
but
because
here
is
his
lift
machine,
it
is
his
lift
machine
on
the
dock,
if
it
is
defective,
certainly
nothing
can
be
attributed
to
the
ship.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
the
conduit
after
which
the
(voice
overlap)
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
yes.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
yes.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
he
has
been.
has
he
been
paid?
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
there
has
been
no
award,
but
he
has
been
paid.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
but
now
as
the
court
can
see
under
the
decision
of
victory
law,
of
victory
carriers
versus
bill
law,
the
vessel
assumes
a
passive
secondary
role
in
extending
this
seaworthiness
warranty.
conceivably
a
vessel
not
even
yet
at
the
dock
could
be
held
unseaworthy,
if
these
men
are
out
moving
the
cargo
in
preparation
for
the
loading
of
the
vessel
or
if
the
vessel
has
already
left
and
they
are
still
moving
the
cargo
from
the
dock
into
the
warehouse.
the
court
has
simply
pushed
the
vessel
aside
and
really
in
this
case,
i
respectfully
submit
the
vessel’s
only
association
with
this
accident
was
the
fact
that
she
lay
along
side
the
pier.
now,
there
is
the
one
other
question
of
was
mr.
law
in
the
service
of
the
ship?
i
respectfully
submit
there
is
no
justification
for
extending
the
strict
and
rigid
standard
of
seaworthiness
to
persons
similarly
situated
as
respondent
mr.
law
in
this
case.
the
appellate
court
found
that
he
was
intimately
involved
in
loading
process
and
was
subjected
to
the
perils
and
the
households
of
the
sea.
in
mahnich
versus
southern
steamship
company,
this
court
said
the
justification
for
the
rigid
standard
of
seaworthiness
as
to
a
seaman,
let
us
say,
through
blue
going
to
a
sea
seaman,
he
subject
to
the
rigorous
discipline
of
the
sea
and
all
the
conditions
of
this
service
constrain
him
to
accept
without
critical
examination
and
without
protest
working
conditions
and
appliances
as
commanded
by
his
superior
officers.
this
was
the
reason
given
for,
or
the
justification
for
setting
a
strict,
rigid
standard
of
unseaworthiness.
and
sieracki,
where
the
seaworthiness
warranty
was
given
to
the
longshoreman
who
was
aboard,
loading
and
unloading.
the
court
said
that
loading
and
unloading
was
within
the
perils
and
hazards
to
which
a
seaman
works
for.
but
here,
this
respondent
in
driving
this
forklift
truck
on
the
dock
was
no
more
subjected
to
the
perils
and
hazards
of
the
sea
than
any
forklift
operator
in
any
warehouse
in
the
united
states.
is
he
just
happened
to
be
one
step
closer
to
the
movement
of
this
cargo,
he
would
move
it
one
point
where
it
would
be
set
down
and
subsequently
loaded
aboard
the
vessel.
those
individuals
who
are
operating
forklift
machines
in
other
locations,
in
other
warehouses
have
certainly
not
been
extended
any
shield
of
protection
similar
to
the
shield
given
to
longshoreman
on
board
vessels
or
to
seaman
who
are
subjected
to
the
hazards
and
perils
of
the
sea.
now,
we
do
not
contend
that
mr.
law
was
not
performing
some
service
for
this
vessel.
but
he
was
performing
normal
service
for
this
vessel
than
enumerable
other
people,
would
perform
to
prepare
a
vessel
for
her
voyage.
i
believe
this
is
what
the
district
court
said.
and
also
the
district
court
said
that
somewhere
there
had
to
be
a
beginning
to
this
loading
process
and
somewhere
there
had
to
be
an
ending.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
thank
you
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
can
continue
with
my
argument
of
yesterday,
we
submit
that
there
must
be
a
beginning
and
an
ending
to
the
loading
and
discharging
process
insofar
as
the
obligation
of
a
vessel's
warranty
of
seaworthiness
is
concerned.
this
is
necessary
for
the
guidance
of
litigants
as
well
as
for
the
law
of
course.
what
started
principally
as
the
humanitarian
policy
by
this
court
in
sieracki
to
include
those
shore-based
workers
on
a
vessel,
who
were
performing
work,
traditionally
performed
by
seamen
within
the
strict
and
rigid
warranty
of
seaworthiness
has
now
been
taken
onto
the
pier
and
extended
to
the
shore-based
worker
who
is
operating
exclusive
shore-based
equipment
and
as
i
stated
yesterday,
in
recent
case
of
mcneil
has
even
been
carried
into
the
warehouse.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
the
mcneil
case
was
out
of
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania.
it
was
within
the
past
2-3
months,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
yes,
in
supplemental
brief
which
we
filed.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
it
was
a
district
court
opinion
sir.
there
must
be
a
limit
to
the
extent
of
the
vessel's
warranty.
we
submit
that
the
limits
imposed
by
the
district
court
in
this
case
are
both
realistic
and
reasonable,
that
is
that
loading
of
cargo
insofar
as
the
vessel's
warranty
is
concerned,
commences
when
the
vessels
tackle
becomes
a
tax
to
the
cargo
and
that
unloading
terminates
when
the
cargo
is
landed
on
to
dock
or
into
a
vehicle
into
which
it
is
being
discharged.
this
has
long
been
the
test
of
liability
as
between
a
ship
and
shipper,
often
referred
to
tackle
to
tackle.
such
a
limitation
does
no
offense
to
sieracki
or
to
peterson
or
to
the
gutierrez's
case,
because
the
dockside
worker
who
is
actually
injured
by
the
ship's
own
gear,
equipment,
cargo
containers,
arch
crew,
would
still
remain
within
the
warranty.
the
circuit
court
below
in
this
case
held
that
the
district
court's
limitation
of
the
warranty
represented
a
minority
view
which
defined
the
loading
in
an
exceedingly
narrow
and
mechanical
fashion
and
chose
to
align
itself
with
other
cases,
which
define
loading
and
unloading
code
in
a
realistic
sense
rather
than
hypothetical
terms
of
art.
in
so
holding,
the
court
of
appeals
below
has
in
effect
completely
disregarded
the
basis
upon
which
the
seaworthiness
doctrine
is
premised,
that
is
to
afford
protection
to
those
individuals
who
are
subjected
to
the
rigorous
discipline
of
the
sea,
going
back
to
mehnich
v.
southern
steamship
company.
further,
the
court
below
as
we
are
argued
yesterday,
disregarded
the
extension
of
admiralty
jurisdiction
act.
we
would
invite
the
court's
attention
to
the
opinion
of
judge
watkins
in
a
recent
case
from
the
district
court
of
maryland
which
is
greene
(ph)
versus
pope
&
talbot,
we
have
also
cited
in
our
supplemental
brief,
where
after
he
gives
a
historical
discussion
of
the
seaworthiness
doctrine,
commence
on
this
bill
law
case
in
chagois
versus
lykes
brothers
and
the
ninth
circuit
case
of
gilbert
versus
the
hawaiian
legislature
and
after
saying
what
those
cases
hold,
if
i
may
quote,
“this
liability
without
theory
ignores
the
situs
of
the
injury,
ignores
causation,
ignores
whether
realistically
the
ship
is
being
loaded
or
unloaded
and
ignores
the
true
status
of
the
injured
party.
now,
last
term
in
the
case
of
usner
v.
luckenbach
overseas
corporation,
this
court
held
that
it
would
be
erroneous
when
no
condition
of
unseaworthiness
existed
to
hold
the
ship
on
a
liable
for
third
party
single
and
wholly
unforeseeable
act
of
negligence.
we
submit
that
similar
logic
and
reasoning
suggest
to
conclusion
that
a
shipowner
and
his
vessel
should
not
be
held
liable
for
an
accident
which
occurs
solely
on
the
dock
as
a
result
of
exclusively
shore-based
defective
equipment,
which
is
being
used
for
the
purpose
of
moving
or
shifting
cargo
on
the
dock
and
over
which
the
vessel
has
no
control.
the
justification
for
the
imposition
of
the
unseaworthiness
doctrine
with
its
rigid
standard
is
absent
under
the
facts
of
this
case.
as
i
stated
yesterday,
unless
the
law
under
the
facts
of
this
case
was
not
subject
to
the
perils
and
hazards
of
a
sea
nor
was
his
lift
machine
that
he
was
operating
in
appurtenance
of
this
vessel,
we
are
not
suggesting
a
reversal
of
gutierrez
case
because
there
there
was
actual
vessel
involvement
in
that
dockside
injury.
we
do
urge
that
a
limitation
be
placed
on
the
extension
of
the
seaworthiness
warranty
by
limiting
the
principles
which
are
set
forth
in
gutierrez
to
those
instances
where
the
vessel
itself,
its
own
gears,
own
equipment,
has
caused
the
shore-side
injury,
rather
than
shore-based
equipment
over
which
the
vessel
has
absolutely
no
control.
before
i
sit
down
i
would
like
to
say
i
understand
that
probably
it
was
friday,
the
american
trial
lawyers
association
has
filed
the
motion
for
an
amicus
curiae
brief
in
this
case,
i
have
not
seen
it,
i
am
not
in
a
position
to
make
any
response
to
it.
i
do
not
know
what
the
court's
action
would
be
on
it,
but
we
would
respectfully
submit
that
the
fifth
circuit
has
gone
beyond
the
holdings
of
this
court
in
extending
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness
out
on
to
the
dock
to
this
shore
based
equipment
that
if
limitations
and
guidelines
are
not
placed,
we
believe
that
the
hypothetical
situations
which
the
court
expressed
in
gutierrez
which
the
court
below
says,
we
do
not
reach
this
particular
type
of
situation,
however,
it
does
leave
the
door
open
by
saying
we
will
reach
that
case
when
it
comes
before
us.
i
respectfully
submit
that
for
the
reasons
it
was
stated
the
first
circuit
has
erred
and
suggest
and
request
that
be
reversed.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
yes
sir.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
yes
sir
and
i
believe
--
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
yes.
yes
sir,
i
am
told
that
--
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
the
court
denied
the
motion
for
leave
to
file
the
amicus
curiae
brief
on
behalf
of
the
maritime
committee.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
yes.
it
was
denied
and
i
understand
that
either
friday
or
perhaps
yesterday
the
american
trial
lawyers
filed
the
motion
for
an
amicus
curiae
brief.
i
have
not
seen
it
and
had
no
opportunity
to
review
it.
i
do
not
think
this
court
has
ruled
on
that
brief.
thank
you.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
i
would
take
a
couple
of
minutes,
if
i
may
your
honor.
i
am
going
to
take
up
on
the
last
question
of
who
must
bear
the
cost.
the
court
would
recall
that
the
longshoremen
harbor
workers'
act
was
passed
so
that
the
injured
longshoreman
would
have
his
remedy
for
the
vessel
side
or
the
water
side
of
the
dock.
now,
the
court
has
held
that
this
is
the
longshoreman's
exclusive
remedy
against
his
employer,
is
under
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers'
act.
i
think
the
court
has
in
its
questions
touched
on
the
problem
that
we
have
here.
as
a
practical
matter,
mr.
law
got
his
employer
where
if
he
prevails
here
would
pay
whatever
he
receives
that
is
sometimes
in
the
industry
known
as
two
bites
from
the
apple.
he
had
one
bite
for
his
compensation,
he
then
brings
his
action
against
the
vessel
for
this
shore-side
injury.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
no
sir,
there
has
not
been
a
claim
for
that.
it
was
voluntarily
paid
under
the
alabama
state
compensation
act.
mr.
w.
boyd
reeves
the
longshoremen
harbor
workers'
act
under
nacirema
would
not
apply
to
this
type
of
thing,
as
it
happened
on
the
dock.
mr.
diamond
spoke
of
the
survey
of
the
dangerous
type
of
work
that
longshoremen
do.
as
i
recall
reading
the
yale
law
journal
article,
says
with
the
possible
exception
of
logging
and
other
industries
to
discuss
all
type
of
construction,
heavy
labor,
any
type
of
work
where
man
is
exposed
to
walking
the
beams
of
constructing
buildings,
on
the
dock,
whatever
he
maybe
doing
is
dangerous
work.
nowhere
under
any
as
the
law
as
any
workmen
given
the
shield
of
protection
as
a
longshoreman
has
been
given
specially
in
this
case
here
as
exclusively
on
the
docket.
the
court
would
recall
the
pope
&
talbot
versus
hawn,
teaches
us
this
is
not
the
label
that
we
put
on
the
man
where
these
longshoreman
with
the
type
of
work
that
he
is
doing.
the
one
other
point
that
you
said
was
not
in
the
record,
the
record
does
state
that
in
response
to
questions
on
page
91
that
where
he
got
those
forklift
machines,
he
said
he
picked
it
up
at
the
garage,
at
gus
garage
that
morning
and
drove
it
down
to
the
vessel
to
start
his
work.
i
do
not
know
where
it
was
the
day
before.
again
i
would
respectfully
submit
the
court
below
has
extended
the
doctrine
too
far
and
request
this
court
to
place
limitations
by
reversing
the
court
below.
thank
you
very
much.
