justice
potter
stewart
the
district
court,
as
i
understand
in
this
case
verbalize
disposition
a
little
bit
differently
from
the
way
you
are,
is
it
not?
did
he
not
say
the
plaintiff
was
not
engaged
in
loading
the
vessel.
justice
potter
stewart
therefore
it
was
not
within
the
scope
of
protection.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
within
this
time.
justice
potter
stewart
very
good.
justice
potter
stewart
the
mcneil
case
was
a
fifth
circuit
case,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart

that
in
your
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
right,
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.

justice

the
national
maritime
compensation
committee
as
amicus

justice
potter
stewart
that
was
filed
september
15.
justice
potter
stewart
i
am
referring
to
that,
(voice
overlap)
see
that.
justice
potter
stewart
that
motion
was
denied?
justice
potter
stewart
that
might
suggest
that
the
whole
doctrine
of
unseaworthiness
ought
to
be
reexamined
in
perils
of
the
sea,
in
the
eighth
decade
of
the
20th
century
on
akin
to
what
they
were
back
in
17th
and
18th
and
early
19th
centuries?
justice
potter
stewart
and
we
all
put
seaman
then
under
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers'
act?
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
on
this
that
appears
on
this
question,
is
there
anything?
justice
potter
stewart
and
deposition
goes
to
what
he
was
doing
and
his
injury
and
what
he
is
paid,
that
sort
of
thing?
justice
potter
stewart
you
really
think
that
a
seaman
ever
really
has
done
the
work
of
loading
and
unloading?
i
know
what
it
was
said
in
sieracki.
justice
potter
stewart
what
i
have
read
in
this
court's
opinion
is
this
is
a
traditional
work
of
seaman,
but
what
i
read
historically,
going
back
to
the
phoenician
the
ship
tied
up
on
the
dock
and
seaman
went
to
shore
and
relaxed,
(voice
overlap)
and
somebody
else
loaded
and
unloaded
the
ship?
justice
potter
stewart
whoever
did
it
would
have
to
do
it
in
that
fashion
at
that
point?
