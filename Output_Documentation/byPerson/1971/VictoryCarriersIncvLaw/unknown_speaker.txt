unknown
speaker
now
this
act
in
that
--
it
was
not
within
the
longshoreman
act,
was
that?
unknown
speaker
does
longshoreman’s
act
only
cover
the
accident
on
the
pier?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
and
so,
does
the
state
workmen's
compensation
act
is,
is
it
applied
to
it?
unknown
speaker
and
the
question
is
whether
--
and
it
cannot
be
assumed
that
is
the
case,
is
does
it,
not
a
seaman,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
and
though
there
--
the
question
of
seaworthiness,
sick
liability,
replacing
or
just
compensation
ro
supplemental
--
unknown
speaker
yes.
and
it
would
be
the
standard
for
unseaworthiness?
unknown
speaker
and
the
recovery
was
--
basically
recovery
would
not
be
limited
to
workmen's
compensation
amount.
unknown
speaker
and
then
there
would
be
a
warranty
over
it.
unknown
speaker
if
there
was
a
breach
of
it.
unknown
speaker
if
the
vessel
does
not
really
get
in
here
at
all,
except
there
is
nominal
defendant
or
out
of
whom
the
--
hang
the
liability
of
unseaworthiness.
unknown
speaker
the
conduit
to
which
this
man
sues,
he
do
not
employ
him.
and
get
to
recover
from
his
own
and
not
from
other.
unknown
speaker
the
same
way
as
in
the
area
where
the
longshoreman's
act
applies.
unknown
speaker
have
he
had
a
statements
if
compensation?
unknown
speaker
yes,
has
he
got
an
award?
unknown
speaker
oh!
on
workmen's
compensation
on
the
alabama
state
compensation
act.
unknown
speaker
that
is
not
in
the
record.
unknown
speaker
your
point
is
simply
that
the
loading
was
necessarily
at
least
a
two-stage
process.
unknown
speaker
well,
yes
but
it
will
end
up
on
stevedoring?
unknown
