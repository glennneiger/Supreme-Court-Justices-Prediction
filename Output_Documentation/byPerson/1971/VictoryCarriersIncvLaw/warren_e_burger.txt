it
was
the
directing
authority
of

who
was
the
person
who
had
the
control
over
this
man’s
activities
in
this
work?
chief

warren
e.

and
they
both
worked
for
the
stevedoring
company?
chief

e.

is
the
--
practice
is
the
stevedoring
company
and
independent

chief

e.

well
that
would
be,
not
the
usual
situation
or
would
it
be?
chief

warren
e.
burger
well,
the
first
stage
after
it
reaches
the
vessel,
when
it
comes
down
in
the
sling,
does
it
normally
get
to
its
final
resting
place
in
the
hatch
at
that
point
from
as
to
be
moved
and
loaded
by
people
who
are
on
the
ship’s
crew,
must
be
put
in
place?
chief
justice
warren
e.

it
would
be
hard
to
say
that
most
of
the
cargo
has
to
be
moved
after
it
is
removed
from
the
sling
on
most
--
chief

e.

mr.
diamond
in
response
to
mr.
justice
white's
question,
you
were
dealing
with
operational
negligence
of
one
forklift
in
relation
to
another.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
instead
of
operational
negligence
if
the
injury
occurred
as
a
result
of
defective
steering
gear
of
one
of
the
forklifts
which
let
it
run
wild
and
hits
either
another
man
or
his
forklift?
chief

so
that
there
is
no
significance
then
--
chief

--
to
the
operational
negligence
aspect?
chief

warren
e.
burger
even
more

chief

warren
e.

unless
they
are
shore-based

all
the
time,
are
they
not?
chief

warren
e.
burger
mr.
diamond,
looking
at
the
relationship
between
the
master
of
the
vessel
and
the
stevedoring
company,
is
the
master's
control
substantially
like
or
is
it
different
control
which
a
general
contractor
exercises
over
the
employees
of
the
subcontractor
in
the
general
field
of
construction
or
any
other
area?
chief

now,
you
had
said
before
that
the
stevedoring
company
has
an
independent
contractor
in
his
relations
with
the
vessel
and
its
owner?
chief

i
suppose
the
subcontractor
is
an
independent
contractor
with

to
a
general
contractor?

mr.

now
that
