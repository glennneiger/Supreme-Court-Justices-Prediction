mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
talk
about
the
facts
in
just
a
minute.
bill
law
was
a
member
of
the
ila,
international
longshoreman's
association,
local
1410.
he
was
a
member
of
the
gang
of
willy
kaiser
and
he
was
selected
in
the
makeup
gang
early
that
morning
in
front
of
union
hall
on
davis
avenue
in
mobile
to
load
this
particular
hatch
of
this
particular
vessel,
the
s.s.
sagamore
hill.
when
he
got
to
the
dock,
he
was
assigned
by
his
foreman
willy
kaiser
to
operate
the
forklift
machine
on
the
dock,
taking
the
landing
mats
from
its
storage
pile
from
the
open
pier,
some
50
feet
from
the
cargo
hook
and
delivering
it
to
the
cargo
hook
from
where
it
was
taken
onto
the
vessel.
they
were
subsequently
loaded
to
the
vessel
by
other
longshoreman
has
been
used
and
i
think
it
could
be
misleading,
it
was
a
continuous
operation,
the
landing
mats
were
sent
out
on
targets
and
it
was
thus
taken
on
to
ship.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
there
was
the
foreman,
a
working
boss
and
a
walking
boss,
in
stevedore
they
call
him
in
mobile
a
gang
foreman.
he
would
have
two.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
yes
and
the
mates
of
the
ship
would
be
in
control
of
the
loading
and
unloading
operation
generally.
the
ship's
officers
always
maintain
supervision
and
control
of
the
vessel
in
the
loading
and
unloading
operation.
customarily,
it
is
my
understanding
that
they
do
not
interfere
with
the
stevedoring
contractor's
control
unless
they
see
something
that
is
wrong
in
the
manner
of
storage
or
something
wrong,
it
is
in
the
manner
of
the
loading
or
discharging.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
yes.
i
would
like
to
mention
one
fact
that
maybe
considered
pertinent,
but
is
not
in
the
record,
if
i
may.
this
case
was
heard
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
only
the
deposition
of
bill
law
was
taken.
the
fact
that
i
would
like
to
mention
is
that
the
bill
law’s
fellow
workers
had
worked
this
vessel
the
day
before,
had
loaded
landing
mats
into
the
hold
of
this
particular
hatch,
in
the
wings
of
this
hold,
and
had
worked
to
the
hatch
square.
the
forklift
that
was
used
in
the
hold
of
the
ship,
the
day
before
for
taking
the
landing
mats
into
the
wings
of
the
ship,
was
not
necessary
when
they
were
landing
in
the
square
of
the
hatch
and
that
morning
it
was
taken
out
of
the
hatch
onto
the
dock
and
it
is
the
machine
that
bill
law
was
using.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
that
is
not
in
the
record
mr.
justice.
i
think
that
that
it
is
commonly
accepted
in
the
industry
and
everybody
recognizes
that
most
of
the
cargo
that
requires
a
lift
machine
to
get
it
to
the
hook,
requires
a
lift
machine
in
the
hatch
to
get
it
to
its
place
of
storage
in
the
hatch
unless
it
can
be
landed
directly
into
the
square
of
the
hatch.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
yes.
i
do
not
understand
your
question.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
it
must
be
put
in
place
unless
that
can
swing
to
its
place
by
the
pendulum
of
the
cargo
fall.
if
it
is
going
into
the
wing
it
must
get
into
its
place
in
some
fashion
either
by
men
carrying
it,
they
are
rolling
it,
they
are
pushing
it,
they
are
by
forklift
machine
and
taking
it
into
the
wings.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
most
of
it.
i
imagine
there
would
be
more
space
in
the
wings
than
there
would
be
in
the
hatch
square,
yes
sir.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
the
storage
of
the
landing
mats
on
the
pier,
if
they
did
what
sir?
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
shifted?
during
the
--
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
during
the
loading
operation,
had
they
shifted
and
gotten
bill
law
--
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
think
so.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
agree,
mr.
reeves
--mr.
justice
that
there
has
got
to
be
a
beginning
and
an
end.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
think
that
the
beginning
and
end
can
be
approached
from
several
concepts
of
test.
i
think
that
the
beginning
and
end
could
be
considered
from
a
loading
or
unloading
concept
from
a
work
traditionally
done
by
a
seaman
concept,
from
a
remoteness
and
time
and
place
concepts,
in
the
service
of
the
ship
concept.
i
think
that
probably
--
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
think
that
just
what
your
honor
is
indicating
that
it
must
have
a
beginning
and
end.
i
think
that
the
delivery
man
delivering
it
onto
the
pier
is
just
that
a
delivery
man
delivering
it.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
do
not
think
that
--
i
think
we
would
have
to
--
we
are
talking
about
unseaworthiness,
we
would
have
to
have
some
unseaworthiness
involved
if
law
to
have
a
cause
of
action.
i
think
the
unseaworthiness
would
have
to
be
related
to
the
cargo
on
the
--
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
think
that
the
remoteness
in
time
and
place,
i
think,
that
the
vessel
should
be
at
the
pier.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
think
the
loading
and
unloading
operation
should
be
in
actual
progress
and
for
it
to
be
an
actual
progress,
i
suppose
it
would
have
to
be
tied
up
sir.
i
think
this
vessel
should
be
at
the
pier.
the
loading
or
discharging
operation
should
be
in
actual
progress.
i
think
the
day
before,
the
day
after
is
too
remote
in
time
and
the
place,
i
think,
that
it
must
be
within
the
area
of
the
dock.
we
get
into
some
hypotheticals
there
that
would
depend
upon
the
various
customs
in
the
ports
and
the
locations
of
the
port.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
alright.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
it
would
depend
if
the
forklift
itself,
the
headache
right
came
down
and
got
bill
law,
i
think
that
it
would
so.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
because
he
is
loading
the
vessel.
he
is
doing
work
traditionally
done
by
a
seaman,
is
in
the
service
of
the
ship.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
it
is
not
traditionally
done
--
it
is
done
by
seaman
today
in
some
instances.
it
has
not
been
completely
--
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
in
some
instances
i
would
suppose.
i
do
not
know
of
any
in
port
of
mobile
but
-
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
--
in
times
of
war
the
crews
customarily
discharge
the
ships
in
foreign
ports.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
is
done
by
the
longshoremen
--
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
it
is
done
by
the
longshoremen,
customarily
yes
sir.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
with
machinery,
yes
sir.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
the
seaman,
it
might
be
considered
in
line
with
the
reasoning
of
--
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
yes,
we
have
a
--
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
no,
no
i
misunderstood
your
question.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
only
those
piers
on
the
west
coast
are
controlled
by
the
west
coast
union
sir.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
think
that
it
would.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
do
not
know
if
you
could
have
concurrent
jurisdiction
at
matter.
it
would
be
my
position,
your
honor,
that
the
general
maritime
law
should
not
be
confined
by
the
pier's
age.
in
general
maritime
status
--
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
it
could
be,
yes.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
find
it
a
little
difficult
to
distinguish
between
the
defective
plank
and
the
--
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
and
the
plank
with
the
beams
on
it.
yes
sir.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
if
it
is
within
the
loading
operation
and
loading
is
going
on
this
tied
up
and
it
is
in
(voice
overlap)
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
do
not
think
that
it
would
go
to
the
doctrine
of
warranty
of
seaworthiness
going
to
bill
law
would
not
cover
him
injured
by
the
other
forklift.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
because
this
is
quite
loading
it.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
my
view
is,
your
honor,
that
the
appurtenance
of
the
other
forklift
serving
another
ship
was
not
in
the
service
of
this
ship.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
it
could
not
be
a
jones
act,
but
it
and
i
imagine
it
would
be
covered
by
state
law.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
think
we
would
either
have
to
have
negligence
of
the
vessel
on
the
seaworthy
and
the
condition
of
the
vessel
appurtenance
of
the
vessel.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
agree
with
the
holding
of
negligence
entirely.
we
never
did
have
operational
negligence
in
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
yes,
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
that
maybe
that,
i
am
not
sure.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
there
was
no
award
as
such.
he
was
paid
compensation
for
temporary
total
disability
for
the
period
of
time
he
was
disabled.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
think
that
under
the
holdings
of
this
court
in
nacirema
that
the
state
law
definitely
would
go
to
the
longshoreman
on
the
dock
and
when
he
leaves
the
docks
going
towards
the
ship
it
is
of
course
become
a
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers'
act.
i
do
not
know
if
i
have
answered
your
question
sir.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
feel
that
it
would
be
an
area
of
general
maritime
where
as
the
general
maritime
law
of
the
united
states
would
have
jurisdiction.
i
do
not
necessarily
feel
it
would
preempt
the
state
law.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
perhaps.
i
see
no
conflict
if
we
all
had
--
i
see
no
reason
why
you
could
not
have
concurrent
jurisdiction.
i
do
not
think
necessarily
one
precludes
the
other.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
think
that
--
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
my
answer
would
be
the
same.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
do
not
think
--
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
think,
we
would
have
an
unseaworthy
machine
if
it
went
to
ship
b,
but
since
law
was
loading
ship
a,
the
sagamore
hill,
it
would
not
be
appurtenance
of
the
sagamore
hill
and
it
would
not
be
an
unseaworthy
condition
of
which
bill
law
could
recover
against
the
sagamore
hill
or
against
the
ship
b
because
he
was
not
engaged
in
service
of
that
ship.
mr.
reeves
mentions
the
perils
and
risk
of
a
seaman.
in
1954,
the
national
academy
of
sciences
conducted
a
study
of
the
various
dangerous
occupations
in
the
united
states
and
in
that
study
the
longshoreman’s
industry
was
by
far
the
most
dangerous
occupation,
far
exceeding
the
logging
industry,
the
sawmill
industry
and
steel
erection
occupation.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
do
not
recall.
this
study
is
reported
in
volume
75
of
the
yale
law
journal
and
is
reported
as
the
most
dangerous
industry,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
think
going
to
sea
is
still
a
hazardous
occupation.
i
think
every
one
will
agree
to
that,
but
i
think
that
the
longshoring
industry
is
more
dangerous.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
hope
that,
mr.
justice,
i
hope
not.
i
think
that
the
reason
for
the
rule
is
that
work
is
dangerous
and
still
there.
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
in
the
service
of
the
ship
is
other
reason
for
the
rule
and
the
third
reason
that
the
industry
is
better
able
to
distribute
for
the
loss,
more
so
than
the
injured
seaman
or
the
injured
longshoreman,
if
the
site
was
still
there.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
they
are
not
as
helpless
as
they
were
in
days
gone
by.
we
have
--
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
they
are
not
any
more
so
helpless.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
well,
they
have
the
same
position
that
most
industries
have
in
that
bargaining
set
up
in
the
country
today.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
that
was
the
international
longshoreman's
association.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
think
this
--
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
they
do
not
need.
let
me
phrase
this
way
if
i
may.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
think
the
master
of
the
ships
still
runs
the
ship.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
would
think
not.
i
do
not
think
that
he
should
have.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
agree
that
he
should
not
have.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
he
has
the
power
of
the
control
of
the
ship.
they
never
relinquish
the
control
of
ship.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
think
that
in
inquiry
to
an
officer
of
the
ship
would
reflect
that
the
ship
never
relinquishes
control
over
the
loading
or
discharging
operation.
they
are
in
the
control.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
mr.
justice,
law
was
under
the
direct
supervision
of
willy
kaiser,
his
gang
boss,
he
was
a
member
of
the
same
union.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
he
was
under
the
indirect
supervision
of
the
stevedore
superintendent,
a
man
named
mr.
marino
in
this
instance.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
he
was
under
the
supervision
of
the
mate
in
control
of
the
ship.
as
a
practical
matter
the
mate
never
instructs
these
longshoremen
in
the
way
that
they
do
their
work.
he
does
not
tell
them
what
to
do
or
how
to
do
it.
but
he
is
in
control.
he
has
supervising.
he
is
paid
to
be
there
and
watch
the
operation.
he
sees
that
the
cargo
goes
into
its
proper
place
on
the
ship
and
if
he
sees
an
improper
method
or
an
unsafe
condition
going
on,
he
has
got
a
duty
to
correct
it
and
to
stop
it.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
yes,
if
he
is
loading
his
ship.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
if
it
is
in
the
process
of
loading
the
ship,
yes
sir.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
think
i
do.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
under
my
interpretation
of
the
law,
it
would
be
an
appurtenance
in
serving
this
vessel
and
if
the
doctrine
of
the
seaworthiness
extends
to
the
appurtenances
of
the
vessel,
it
would
estimate.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
do
not
think
so.
would
he
repair
the
rope
slings
or
the
pallets,
no
sir.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
and
he
could
order
the
forklift
machine
corrected,
operated,
i
think
so.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
no
sir.
there
is
one
summary
judgment
on
a
pre-trial
discovery
deposition
of
bill
law
which
was
taken
before
the
motion
for
summary
in
anticipation
of
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
(voice
overlap)
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
that
is
correct.
yes
sir.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
i
think
that
it
could
be
likened
to
that.
the
general
contractor
over
the
subcontractor's
employees
on
a
general
construction
job,
and
that
fairly
for
me
would
be
hard
effort,
set
up
that
goes.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
do
not
think
that
the
doctrine
of
seaworthiness
should
be
extended
to
the
beans
in
the
oven
(ph)
from
the
bag
in
the
warehouse
in
denver.
i
do
not
think
that
it
should
extend
to
the
longshoreman
who
has
taken
the
truck
of
the
stevedoring
company
to
go
downtown
and
get
some
rope.
i
think
if
we
come
to
a
logical
conclusion
and
apply
these
concepts
or
tests,
remoteness
in
time
and
place,
loading
and
unloading
work
traditionally
done
a
by
seaman
in
the
service
of
the
ship,
we
can
come
to
some
realistic
guidelines,
if
we
may
call
them
that
by
which
to
apply
the
rule.
i
was
stating
a
minute
ago
that
i
felt
the
ship
should
be
working
cargo,
either
loading
or
discharging,
it
should
be
at
the
dock.
i
think
that
the
area
would
be
within
area
of
the
confines
of
the
loading
operation.
we
all
know
that
these
vessels
carry
huge
amounts
of
freight.
it
would
be
impossible
to
place
all
of
the
freight
that
they
carry
underneath
the
hook
and
have
it
ready
there
to
be
lowered
onto
the
ship
when
it
docks.
there
has
got
to
be
a
storage
place
on
the
dock
or
any
adjacent
warehouse
and
that
is
customarily
what
is
done
in
the
industry.
the
cargo
that
is
going
to
be
loaded
to
this
vessel
that
is
coming
in,
it
is
at
a
storage
pile
on
the
dock
or
in
the
warehouse
adjacent
to
the
place
that
the
vessel
is
going
to
dock.
it
has
to
be
brought
from
that
point
to
the
cargo
hook.
and
again
it
carries
great
quantities
of
cargo
and
on
discharge
it
would
be
physically
impossible
to
leave
it
all
under
the
hook.
it
must
be
taken
from
the
hook
to
a
storage
place
on
the
dock
or
in
the
adjacent
warehouse
in
close
proximity
to
where
the
vessel
is
docked.
customarily,
that
is
what
is
done
in
the
loading
and
unloading
operation.
the
vessel
contracts
to
do
just
this.
this
is
part
of
the
cost
of
carrying
the
goods.
it
is
customarily
in
the
trade.
you
can
have
a
special
discharging
or
loading
agreement.
but
by
great
preponderance
when
the
vessel
contracts
to
carry
goods,
they
agree
to
bear
the
cost
of
bringing
it
from
its
storage
point
on
the
dock
or
the
adjacent
warehouse,
and
agree
to
pay
the
cost
of
taking
it
from
the
hook
to
its
storage
pile
on
the
dock
or
at
a
warehouse
immediately
adjacent
to
the
dock.
until
each
functions
are
completed,
the
vessel
does
not
earn
any
freight
at
all.
the
seaman
in
the
olden
days
did
this
work.
they
had
to
do
just
the
same
thing
that
bill
law
did.
they
have
to
take
it
from
the
storage
pile
onto
dock
to
the
hook
and
they
would
have
to
take
it
from
the
hook
to
the
storage
pile
onto
dock.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
yes.
i
think
so,
from
what
i
have
read
it
would
seem
to
me
that
--
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
have
possibly
not
read
as
much
as
your
honor
has.
the
reading
i
had
that
seems
to
bear
that
the
stevedoring
--
longshoring
specialization
had
it
that
meant
in
late
in
the
19th
century.
i
imagine
there
was
an
overlap
where
there
was
some
specialization
and
some
seamen
did
it.
i
am
sure
that
if
the
seamen
did
that,
that
they
would
have
to
do
it
in
this
fashion,
that
they
will
have
to
take
it
from
the
storage.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
yes.
i
think,
any
interpretation
of
loading
and
unloading,
that
does
not
recognize
that
these
functions
are
part
of
the
ship's
work
and
does
not
recognize
that
it
has
to
be
taken
from
this
pile
to
the
hook
and
from
the
hook
to
this
pile,
it
defies
the
english
language.
i
do
not
see
--
it
is
unrealistic
to
me,
cut
off
that
it
is
loaded
or
unloaded
at
the
hook.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
yes.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
we
cannot
ignore
the
present
your
honor.
i
think
we
should
recognize
it.
i
say
this
that
the
reasons
for
the
rule
are
still
there.
any
of
as
who
have
visited
a
freighter,
general
cargo
freighter,
and
one
of
that
doctrine
in
a
port,
that
is
loading
at
two
or
more
hatches,
several
hatches,
recognize
the
danger
that
exists.
their
pallets
of
the
cargo
swinging
overhead
coming
here
and
there,
their
forklift
machines
running
here
and
on,
there
seems
to
be
an
appealing
of
urgency
in
the
air.
it
is
perhaps
contributed
to
by
fact
that
the
stevedoring
companies
work
on
a
tonnage
basis
in
most
ports
rather
than
hourly
basis
and
that
the
vessels
themselves
are
on
a
strict
schedule.
there
is
a
feeling
of
urgency
in
the
air
and
there
is
a
danger
that
exists.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
you
are
right
sir.
yes
that
is
correct
statement.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
the
shipping
industry
itself
will
pay
the
bill.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
and
over
the
years
it
is
a
--
well,
the
stevedore
is
involved
in
the
--
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
mr.
reeves
is
here
representing
the
insurance
carrier
for
the
stevedoring
company,
yes.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
that
is
correct
but
we
have
also
got
to
recognize
that
the
whole
industry
pays
the
cost
and
not
just
a
stevedore,
because
the
stevedore
has
got
to
look
at
the
actual
inexperience
and
what
it
cost
them
in
charge,
make
a
charge
distinction.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
under
the
nacirema,
the
gus
stevedoring
in
this
case
and
bill
law
are
governed
by
the
workers'
compensation's
act
of
alabama.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
do
not
think
that
the
doctrine
of
seaworthiness
that
is
extended
to
the
longshoreman
loading
and
unloading
the
vessel
would
preempt
the
state
law
on
the
compensation.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
as
to
state
law
it
is
got
a
provision
and
subrogation
just
as
the
longshoremen
harbor
workers'
act
has,
the
impact
of
state
law
as
the
longshoreman
and
harbor
workers'
act
provides
for
those
situations
where
the
injured
worker
has
a
cause
of
action
against
a
third
party.
thank
you.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
talk
about
the
facts
in
just
a
minute.
bill
law
was
a
member
of
the
ila,
international
longshoreman's
association,
local
1410.
he
was
a
member
of
the
gang
of
willy
kaiser
and
he
was
selected
in
the
makeup
gang
early
that
morning
in
front
of
union
hall
on
davis
avenue
in
mobile
to
load
this
particular
hatch
of
this
particular
vessel,
the
s.s.
sagamore
hill.
when
he
got
to
the
dock,
he
was
assigned
by
his
foreman
willy
kaiser
to
operate
the
forklift
machine
on
the
dock,
taking
the
landing
mats
from
its
storage
pile
from
the
open
pier,
some
50
feet
from
the
cargo
hook
and
delivering
it
to
the
cargo
hook
from
where
it
was
taken
onto
the
vessel.
they
were
subsequently
loaded
to
the
vessel
by
other
longshoreman
has
been
used
and
i
think
it
could
be
misleading,
it
was
a
continuous
operation,
the
landing
mats
were
sent
out
on
targets
and
it
was
thus
taken
on
to
ship.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
there
was
the
foreman,
a
working
boss
and
a
walking
boss,
in
stevedore
they
call
him
in
mobile
a
gang
foreman.
he
would
have
two.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
yes
and
the
mates
of
the
ship
would
be
in
control
of
the
loading
and
unloading
operation
generally.
the
ship's
officers
always
maintain
supervision
and
control
of
the
vessel
in
the
loading
and
unloading
operation.
customarily,
it
is
my
understanding
that
they
do
not
interfere
with
the
stevedoring
contractor's
control
unless
they
see
something
that
is
wrong
in
the
manner
of
storage
or
something
wrong,
it
is
in
the
manner
of
the
loading
or
discharging.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
yes.
i
would
like
to
mention
one
fact
that
maybe
considered
pertinent,
but
is
not
in
the
record,
if
i
may.
this
case
was
heard
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
only
the
deposition
of
bill
law
was
taken.
the
fact
that
i
would
like
to
mention
is
that
the
bill
law’s
fellow
workers
had
worked
this
vessel
the
day
before,
had
loaded
landing
mats
into
the
hold
of
this
particular
hatch,
in
the
wings
of
this
hold,
and
had
worked
to
the
hatch
square.
the
forklift
that
was
used
in
the
hold
of
the
ship,
the
day
before
for
taking
the
landing
mats
into
the
wings
of
the
ship,
was
not
necessary
when
they
were
landing
in
the
square
of
the
hatch
and
that
morning
it
was
taken
out
of
the
hatch
onto
the
dock
and
it
is
the
machine
that
bill
law
was
using.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
that
is
not
in
the
record
mr.
justice.
i
think
that
that
it
is
commonly
accepted
in
the
industry
and
everybody
recognizes
that
most
of
the
cargo
that
requires
a
lift
machine
to
get
it
to
the
hook,
requires
a
lift
machine
in
the
hatch
to
get
it
to
its
place
of
storage
in
the
hatch
unless
it
can
be
landed
directly
into
the
square
of
the
hatch.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
yes.
i
do
not
understand
your
question.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
it
must
be
put
in
place
unless
that
can
swing
to
its
place
by
the
pendulum
of
the
cargo
fall.
if
it
is
going
into
the
wing
it
must
get
into
its
place
in
some
fashion
either
by
men
carrying
it,
they
are
rolling
it,
they
are
pushing
it,
they
are
by
forklift
machine
and
taking
it
into
the
wings.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
most
of
it.
i
imagine
there
would
be
more
space
in
the
wings
than
there
would
be
in
the
hatch
square,
yes
sir.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
the
storage
of
the
landing
mats
on
the
pier,
if
they
did
what
sir?
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
shifted?
during
the
--
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
during
the
loading
operation,
had
they
shifted
and
gotten
bill
law
--
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
think
so.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
agree,
mr.
reeves
--mr.
justice
that
there
has
got
to
be
a
beginning
and
an
end.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
think
that
the
beginning
and
end
can
be
approached
from
several
concepts
of
test.
i
think
that
the
beginning
and
end
could
be
considered
from
a
loading
or
unloading
concept
from
a
work
traditionally
done
by
a
seaman
concept,
from
a
remoteness
and
time
and
place
concepts,
in
the
service
of
the
ship
concept.
i
think
that
probably
--
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
think
that
just
what
your
honor
is
indicating
that
it
must
have
a
beginning
and
end.
i
think
that
the
delivery
man
delivering
it
onto
the
pier
is
just
that
a
delivery
man
delivering
it.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
do
not
think
that
--
i
think
we
would
have
to
--
we
are
talking
about
unseaworthiness,
we
would
have
to
have
some
unseaworthiness
involved
if
law
to
have
a
cause
of
action.
i
think
the
unseaworthiness
would
have
to
be
related
to
the
cargo
on
the
--
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
think
that
the
remoteness
in
time
and
place,
i
think,
that
the
vessel
should
be
at
the
pier.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
think
the
loading
and
unloading
operation
should
be
in
actual
progress
and
for
it
to
be
an
actual
progress,
i
suppose
it
would
have
to
be
tied
up
sir.
i
think
this
vessel
should
be
at
the
pier.
the
loading
or
discharging
operation
should
be
in
actual
progress.
i
think
the
day
before,
the
day
after
is
too
remote
in
time
and
the
place,
i
think,
that
it
must
be
within
the
area
of
the
dock.
we
get
into
some
hypotheticals
there
that
would
depend
upon
the
various
customs
in
the
ports
and
the
locations
of
the
port.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
alright.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
it
would
depend
if
the
forklift
itself,
the
headache
right
came
down
and
got
bill
law,
i
think
that
it
would
so.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
because
he
is
loading
the
vessel.
he
is
doing
work
traditionally
done
by
a
seaman,
is
in
the
service
of
the
ship.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
it
is
not
traditionally
done
--
it
is
done
by
seaman
today
in
some
instances.
it
has
not
been
completely
--
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
in
some
instances
i
would
suppose.
i
do
not
know
of
any
in
port
of
mobile
but
-
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
--
in
times
of
war
the
crews
customarily
discharge
the
ships
in
foreign
ports.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
is
done
by
the
longshoremen
--
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
it
is
done
by
the
longshoremen,
customarily
yes
sir.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
with
machinery,
yes
sir.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
the
seaman,
it
might
be
considered
in
line
with
the
reasoning
of
--
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
yes,
we
have
a
--
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
no,
no
i
misunderstood
your
question.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
only
those
piers
on
the
west
coast
are
controlled
by
the
west
coast
union
sir.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
think
that
it
would.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
do
not
know
if
you
could
have
concurrent
jurisdiction
at
matter.
it
would
be
my
position,
your
honor,
that
the
general
maritime
law
should
not
be
confined
by
the
pier's
age.
in
general
maritime
status
--
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
it
could
be,
yes.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
find
it
a
little
difficult
to
distinguish
between
the
defective
plank
and
the
--
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
and
the
plank
with
the
beams
on
it.
yes
sir.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
if
it
is
within
the
loading
operation
and
loading
is
going
on
this
tied
up
and
it
is
in
(voice
overlap)
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
do
not
think
that
it
would
go
to
the
doctrine
of
warranty
of
seaworthiness
going
to
bill
law
would
not
cover
him
injured
by
the
other
forklift.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
because
this
is
quite
loading
it.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
my
view
is,
your
honor,
that
the
appurtenance
of
the
other
forklift
serving
another
ship
was
not
in
the
service
of
this
ship.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
it
could
not
be
a
jones
act,
but
it
and
i
imagine
it
would
be
covered
by
state
law.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
think
we
would
either
have
to
have
negligence
of
the
vessel
on
the
seaworthy
and
the
condition
of
the
vessel
appurtenance
of
the
vessel.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
agree
with
the
holding
of
negligence
entirely.
we
never
did
have
operational
negligence
in
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
yes,
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
that
maybe
that,
i
am
not
sure.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
there
was
no
award
as
such.
he
was
paid
compensation
for
temporary
total
disability
for
the
period
of
time
he
was
disabled.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
think
that
under
the
holdings
of
this
court
in
nacirema
that
the
state
law
definitely
would
go
to
the
longshoreman
on
the
dock
and
when
he
leaves
the
docks
going
towards
the
ship
it
is
of
course
become
a
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers'
act.
i
do
not
know
if
i
have
answered
your
question
sir.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
feel
that
it
would
be
an
area
of
general
maritime
where
as
the
general
maritime
law
of
the
united
states
would
have
jurisdiction.
i
do
not
necessarily
feel
it
would
preempt
the
state
law.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
perhaps.
i
see
no
conflict
if
we
all
had
--
i
see
no
reason
why
you
could
not
have
concurrent
jurisdiction.
i
do
not
think
necessarily
one
precludes
the
other.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
think
that
--
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
my
answer
would
be
the
same.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
do
not
think
--
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
think,
we
would
have
an
unseaworthy
machine
if
it
went
to
ship
b,
but
since
law
was
loading
ship
a,
the
sagamore
hill,
it
would
not
be
appurtenance
of
the
sagamore
hill
and
it
would
not
be
an
unseaworthy
condition
of
which
bill
law
could
recover
against
the
sagamore
hill
or
against
the
ship
b
because
he
was
not
engaged
in
service
of
that
ship.
mr.
reeves
mentions
the
perils
and
risk
of
a
seaman.
in
1954,
the
national
academy
of
sciences
conducted
a
study
of
the
various
dangerous
occupations
in
the
united
states
and
in
that
study
the
longshoreman’s
industry
was
by
far
the
most
dangerous
occupation,
far
exceeding
the
logging
industry,
the
sawmill
industry
and
steel
erection
occupation.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
do
not
recall.
this
study
is
reported
in
volume
75
of
the
yale
law
journal
and
is
reported
as
the
most
dangerous
industry,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
think
going
to
sea
is
still
a
hazardous
occupation.
i
think
every
one
will
agree
to
that,
but
i
think
that
the
longshoring
industry
is
more
dangerous.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
hope
that,
mr.
justice,
i
hope
not.
i
think
that
the
reason
for
the
rule
is
that
work
is
dangerous
and
still
there.
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
in
the
service
of
the
ship
is
other
reason
for
the
rule
and
the
third
reason
that
the
industry
is
better
able
to
distribute
for
the
loss,
more
so
than
the
injured
seaman
or
the
injured
longshoreman,
if
the
site
was
still
there.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
they
are
not
as
helpless
as
they
were
in
days
gone
by.
we
have
--
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
they
are
not
any
more
so
helpless.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
well,
they
have
the
same
position
that
most
industries
have
in
that
bargaining
set
up
in
the
country
today.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
that
was
the
international
longshoreman's
association.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
think
this
--
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
they
do
not
need.
let
me
phrase
this
way
if
i
may.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
think
the
master
of
the
ships
still
runs
the
ship.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
would
think
not.
i
do
not
think
that
he
should
have.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
agree
that
he
should
not
have.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
he
has
the
power
of
the
control
of
the
ship.
they
never
relinquish
the
control
of
ship.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
think
that
in
inquiry
to
an
officer
of
the
ship
would
reflect
that
the
ship
never
relinquishes
control
over
the
loading
or
discharging
operation.
they
are
in
the
control.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
mr.
justice,
law
was
under
the
direct
supervision
of
willy
kaiser,
his
gang
boss,
he
was
a
member
of
the
same
union.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
he
was
under
the
indirect
supervision
of
the
stevedore
superintendent,
a
man
named
mr.
marino
in
this
instance.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
he
was
under
the
supervision
of
the
mate
in
control
of
the
ship.
as
a
practical
matter
the
mate
never
instructs
these
longshoremen
in
the
way
that
they
do
their
work.
he
does
not
tell
them
what
to
do
or
how
to
do
it.
but
he
is
in
control.
he
has
supervising.
he
is
paid
to
be
there
and
watch
the
operation.
he
sees
that
the
cargo
goes
into
its
proper
place
on
the
ship
and
if
he
sees
an
improper
method
or
an
unsafe
condition
going
on,
he
has
got
a
duty
to
correct
it
and
to
stop
it.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
yes,
if
he
is
loading
his
ship.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
if
it
is
in
the
process
of
loading
the
ship,
yes
sir.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
think
i
do.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
under
my
interpretation
of
the
law,
it
would
be
an
appurtenance
in
serving
this
vessel
and
if
the
doctrine
of
the
seaworthiness
extends
to
the
appurtenances
of
the
vessel,
it
would
estimate.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
do
not
think
so.
would
he
repair
the
rope
slings
or
the
pallets,
no
sir.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
and
he
could
order
the
forklift
machine
corrected,
operated,
i
think
so.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
no
sir.
there
is
one
summary
judgment
on
a
pre-trial
discovery
deposition
of
bill
law
which
was
taken
before
the
motion
for
summary
in
anticipation
of
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
(voice
overlap)
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
that
is
correct.
yes
sir.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
i
think
that
it
could
be
likened
to
that.
the
general
contractor
over
the
subcontractor's
employees
on
a
general
construction
job,
and
that
fairly
for
me
would
be
hard
effort,
set
up
that
goes.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
do
not
think
that
the
doctrine
of
seaworthiness
should
be
extended
to
the
beans
in
the
oven
(ph)
from
the
bag
in
the
warehouse
in
denver.
i
do
not
think
that
it
should
extend
to
the
longshoreman
who
has
taken
the
truck
of
the
stevedoring
company
to
go
downtown
and
get
some
rope.
i
think
if
we
come
to
a
logical
conclusion
and
apply
these
concepts
or
tests,
remoteness
in
time
and
place,
loading
and
unloading
work
traditionally
done
a
by
seaman
in
the
service
of
the
ship,
we
can
come
to
some
realistic
guidelines,
if
we
may
call
them
that
by
which
to
apply
the
rule.
i
was
stating
a
minute
ago
that
i
felt
the
ship
should
be
working
cargo,
either
loading
or
discharging,
it
should
be
at
the
dock.
i
think
that
the
area
would
be
within
area
of
the
confines
of
the
loading
operation.
we
all
know
that
these
vessels
carry
huge
amounts
of
freight.
it
would
be
impossible
to
place
all
of
the
freight
that
they
carry
underneath
the
hook
and
have
it
ready
there
to
be
lowered
onto
the
ship
when
it
docks.
there
has
got
to
be
a
storage
place
on
the
dock
or
any
adjacent
warehouse
and
that
is
customarily
what
is
done
in
the
industry.
the
cargo
that
is
going
to
be
loaded
to
this
vessel
that
is
coming
in,
it
is
at
a
storage
pile
on
the
dock
or
in
the
warehouse
adjacent
to
the
place
that
the
vessel
is
going
to
dock.
it
has
to
be
brought
from
that
point
to
the
cargo
hook.
and
again
it
carries
great
quantities
of
cargo
and
on
discharge
it
would
be
physically
impossible
to
leave
it
all
under
the
hook.
it
must
be
taken
from
the
hook
to
a
storage
place
on
the
dock
or
in
the
adjacent
warehouse
in
close
proximity
to
where
the
vessel
is
docked.
customarily,
that
is
what
is
done
in
the
loading
and
unloading
operation.
the
vessel
contracts
to
do
just
this.
this
is
part
of
the
cost
of
carrying
the
goods.
it
is
customarily
in
the
trade.
you
can
have
a
special
discharging
or
loading
agreement.
but
by
great
preponderance
when
the
vessel
contracts
to
carry
goods,
they
agree
to
bear
the
cost
of
bringing
it
from
its
storage
point
on
the
dock
or
the
adjacent
warehouse,
and
agree
to
pay
the
cost
of
taking
it
from
the
hook
to
its
storage
pile
on
the
dock
or
at
a
warehouse
immediately
adjacent
to
the
dock.
until
each
functions
are
completed,
the
vessel
does
not
earn
any
freight
at
all.
the
seaman
in
the
olden
days
did
this
work.
they
had
to
do
just
the
same
thing
that
bill
law
did.
they
have
to
take
it
from
the
storage
pile
onto
dock
to
the
hook
and
they
would
have
to
take
it
from
the
hook
to
the
storage
pile
onto
dock.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
yes.
i
think
so,
from
what
i
have
read
it
would
seem
to
me
that
--
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
have
possibly
not
read
as
much
as
your
honor
has.
the
reading
i
had
that
seems
to
bear
that
the
stevedoring
--
longshoring
specialization
had
it
that
meant
in
late
in
the
19th
century.
i
imagine
there
was
an
overlap
where
there
was
some
specialization
and
some
seamen
did
it.
i
am
sure
that
if
the
seamen
did
that,
that
they
would
have
to
do
it
in
this
fashion,
that
they
will
have
to
take
it
from
the
storage.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
yes.
i
think,
any
interpretation
of
loading
and
unloading,
that
does
not
recognize
that
these
functions
are
part
of
the
ship's
work
and
does
not
recognize
that
it
has
to
be
taken
from
this
pile
to
the
hook
and
from
the
hook
to
this
pile,
it
defies
the
english
language.
i
do
not
see
--
it
is
unrealistic
to
me,
cut
off
that
it
is
loaded
or
unloaded
at
the
hook.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
yes.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
we
cannot
ignore
the
present
your
honor.
i
think
we
should
recognize
it.
i
say
this
that
the
reasons
for
the
rule
are
still
there.
any
of
as
who
have
visited
a
freighter,
general
cargo
freighter,
and
one
of
that
doctrine
in
a
port,
that
is
loading
at
two
or
more
hatches,
several
hatches,
recognize
the
danger
that
exists.
their
pallets
of
the
cargo
swinging
overhead
coming
here
and
there,
their
forklift
machines
running
here
and
on,
there
seems
to
be
an
appealing
of
urgency
in
the
air.
it
is
perhaps
contributed
to
by
fact
that
the
stevedoring
companies
work
on
a
tonnage
basis
in
most
ports
rather
than
hourly
basis
and
that
the
vessels
themselves
are
on
a
strict
schedule.
there
is
a
feeling
of
urgency
in
the
air
and
there
is
a
danger
that
exists.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
you
are
right
sir.
yes
that
is
correct
statement.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
the
shipping
industry
itself
will
pay
the
bill.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
and
over
the
years
it
is
a
--
well,
the
stevedore
is
involved
in
the
--
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
mr.
reeves
is
here
representing
the
insurance
carrier
for
the
stevedoring
company,
yes.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
that
is
correct
but
we
have
also
got
to
recognize
that
the
whole
industry
pays
the
cost
and
not
just
a
stevedore,
because
the
stevedore
has
got
to
look
at
the
actual
inexperience
and
what
it
cost
them
in
charge,
make
a
charge
distinction.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
under
the
nacirema,
the
gus
stevedoring
in
this
case
and
bill
law
are
governed
by
the
workers'
compensation's
act
of
alabama.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
i
do
not
think
that
the
doctrine
of
seaworthiness
that
is
extended
to
the
longshoreman
loading
and
unloading
the
vessel
would
preempt
the
state
law
on
the
compensation.
mr.
ross
diamond,
jr.
as
to
state
law
it
is
got
a
provision
and
subrogation
just
as
the
longshoremen
harbor
workers'
act
has,
the
impact
of
state
law
as
the
longshoreman
and
harbor
workers'
act
provides
for
those
situations
where
the
injured
worker
has
a
cause
of
action
against
a
third
party.
thank
you.
