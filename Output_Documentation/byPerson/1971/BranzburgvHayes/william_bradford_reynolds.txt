mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
is
appearing
as
amicus
in
these
cases
and
the
case
that
follows
in
a
matter
of
paul
pappas,
and
i
therefore,
will
address
my
remarks
here
to
the
three
cases
involved.
the
broad
argument
with
respect
to
the
first
amendment,
and
whether
there
is
in
the
first
amendment
a
privilege
for
news
reporters
to
withhold
from
grand
jury
investigations
information
that
they
might
have,
my
argument
may
well
overlap.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
don’t
believe
the
attorney
general
guidelines
would
apply
to
these
cases.
their
state
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
the
attorney
general
guidelines
do
not
grant
any
immunity
to
a
news
reporter
with
respect
to
grand
jury
proceedings,
but
they
do
set
of
a
procedure,
whereby
before
a
reporter
will
be
called
before
a
grand
jury.
there
will
be
some
negotiation
with
the
news
media
prior
to
that
time,
and
to
ascertain
to
determine
the
need
for
the
testimony
of
the
reporter.
and
that
whether
or
not
there
are
other
sources
from
which
information
might
be
gleaned
to
the
same
nature.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
not
to
my
knowledge
at
the
present
time.
i’m
not
aware
of
any
case
as
far.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
essentially
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
believe
we
are
dealing
in
a
sensitive
area.
i
don’t
believe
anybody
disputes
that
point.
the
question
here
is
whether
we
are
to
create
a
new
constitutional
privilege
in
the
first
amendment
for
a
specific
class
of
citizens
that
is
news
reporters.
and
i
don’t
believe
that
the
fact
that
the
attorney
general
has
issued
guidelines
in
what
is
an
admittedly
a
sensitive
area
that
it
follows
in
that
fact
we
need
to
create
a
constitutional
privilege
of
this
nature.
now
before
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
your
honor,
i
think
we
all
recognize
that
when
we’re
talking
about
newsgathering
that
in
the
penumbra
of
first
amendment
interest,
there
is
lurking
somewhere
an
interesting
news
gathering.
i
don’t
think
that
there’s
much
doubt
if
the
government
were
to
cut
off
all
access
to
a
particularly
impoverished
area,
for
example,
solely
for
the
reason
that
they
do
not
want
the
public
to
know
what
was
going
on
there.
that
would
be
permissible
under
the
first
amendment,
but
newsgathering
is
an
exceedingly
broad
concept.
and
as
this
court
recognized
in
zemel
and
rusk,
in
many
respects,
it
connotes
action
more
than
expression.
i
think
plainly,
one
does
not
have
any
constitutional
right
to
access
to
a
particular
newsworthy
stories,
or
newsworthy
items.
i
for
instance,
don’t
think
that
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
a
news
reporter
could
gain
access
to
a
white
house
conference,
or
a
conference
in
the
supreme
court,
for
example,
because
it
might
be
a
newsworthy
story.
moreover,
and
this
has
been
pointed
out
in
prior
questions
and
answers
before
the
court,
newsgathering
as
a
first
amendment
interest,
is
not
an
interest
that
is
only
with
the
institutionalized
press
or
the
news
reporter.
i
think
that
any
citizen,
any
individual
who
is
concerned
with
exchanging
ideas
or
disseminating
information
to
others,
whether
he
be
a
news
reporter,
an
author,
a
freelance
writer,
a
professor,
has
the
same
interest
in
the
first
amendment
in
newsgathering,
nor
in
my
view
is
it
confined
to
the
written
word,
or
publication
i
think
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
pointed
out.
the
lecturer
or
the
public
debater,
or
any
individual
citizen
who
wish
to
exchange
ideas
or
information
with
friends
or
associates,
would
have
the
same
interest
in
gathering
news.
i
don’t
think
it’s
an
exclusive
interest
that
we
find
in
the
free
press
language
of
the
first
amendment.
i
think
it
is
also
inherent
in
free
speech.
and
it
is
our
view,
that
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
theory,
if
we’re
going
to
construct
a
privilege
based
on
a
first
amendment
interest
in
newsgathering,
that
that
privilege
is
going
to
have
to
pertain,
not
just
to
news
reporters,
but
to
anybody
who
says
that
in
appearance
before
a
grand
jury
is
going
to
have
a
chilling
effect
on
his
confidential
sources
of
information.
and
there’s
an
additional
difficulty
that
in
those
circumstances,
there
is
an
additional
difficulty
on
how
to
determine
or
verify
confidentiality.
that’s
one
of
those
factors
that
court
by
its
nature
is
going
to
be
unable
to
scrutinize.
our
position
is
essentially,
that
to
allow
this
type
of
wholesale
interference,
and
it
would
be
wholesale
interference
with
the
grand
jury,
is
contrary
and
undercuts
the
specific
protections
that
the
framers
of
the
constitution
intended
by
the
fifth
amendment.
the
fifth
amendment
provides
that
a
grand
jury
shall
be
the
sole
method
for
preferring
charges
in
serious
criminal
cases.
our
grand
jury
is
modeled
after
the
english
grand
jury,
has
a
body
of
laymen
with
very
broad
powers
to
investigate
in
secret,
alleged
criminal
acts
not
only
for
determining
probable
guilt,
but
also
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
innocent
people
of
false
prosecutions.
from
the
early
days
of
the
republic,
and
indeed
in
england,
attendance
upon
and
testimony
before
grand
jury
has
been
a
public
duty
for
which
every
citizen
is
bound
to
perform
when
summoned.
we
don’t
think
that
the
framers
of
the
constitution
were
unaware
of
this
obligation.
nor
do
we
think
they
were
unaware
of
the
fact,
as
has
been
pointed
out
already
in
prior
discussion
this
morning,
that
anybody
who’s
called
before
a
grand
jury,
is
going
to
have
some
adverse
effect
on
first
amendment
interests,
either
speech,
or
associational
ties,
or
press.
but
the
area
of
this
potential
conflict
is
an
exceedingly
narrow
one.
it’s
an
area
that
deals
only
with
question
of
criminal
activity.
and
in
that
narrow
area,
we
think
that
the
framers
of
the
constitution,
in
reconciling
the
broad
public
interest
in
having
a
grand
jury
with
these
broad
investigatorial
powers.
and
the
first
amendment
interest
that
might
be
indirectly
affected,
by
calling
in
people
to
appear
before
grand
juries,
that
they
apparently
determine
that
there
should
be
no
alternation
of
the
general
requirement,
that
people
appear
and
give
testimony
before
grand
juries.
now
they
did
write
an
exception
into
the
fifth
amendment.
the
exception
against
self-incrimination,
but
there
is
no
exception
written
into
the
first
amendment.
we
think
that
the
very
direct
effect
that
is
possible
on
first
amendment
interest
that
is
interest
of
speech
and
association,
which
are
in
our
view
far
more
direct
first
amendment
interest,
than
what
we
are
talking
about
here
which
is
a
more
remote
interest
in
newsgathering.
but
the
effect
on
those
direct
interest
by
appearing
before
the
grand
jury,
where
we
think
not
unforeseen
by
the
framers,
and
they
do
not
see
fit
to
rate
any
privilege
into
the
first
amendment.
and
we
don’t
believe
that
this
more
remote
interest
in
terms
of
newsgathering
is
one
that
would
require
that
we
now
create
a
new
privilege
in
the
first
amendment.
now,
we’ve
heard
a
lot
this
morning
about
the
fact
that
a
holding
by
this
court
the
effect
that
there
is
no
privilege
in
the
first
amendment
is
going
to
dry
up
news
sources.
the
news
media
in
this
country
have
of
course
existed
for
almost
200
years
without
a
constitutional
privilege
of
the
sort
of
thing
there
is
to
hear.
confidential
sources
have
long
been
used
in
the
newsgathering
process
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
in
many
areas?
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
what
is
worked
out?
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
think
that
that
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
think
that
that
is
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
think
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
the
function
of
those
guidelines,
that’s
correct
your
honor.
and
if
no
constitutional
privilege
is
recognized,
there
are
the
guidelines,
and
of
course
it
will
continue
as
mr.
justice
marshall
suggested
to
have
the
same
kind
of
negotiations.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
do
your
honor.
i
don’t
think
there
is
a
distinction
along
those
lines.
as
far
as
the
drawing
up
of
the
sources,
this
claim,
we
might
point
out,
is
being
made
by
a
certain
segment
of
the
media,
by
in
these
cases,
essentially
the
large
metropolitan
newspapers,
by
amicus
briefs
the
large
major
tv
networks.
and
that
professor
blazy’s
(ph)
report
that
has
been
referred
to
yesterday,
talks
also
in
terms
of
as
his
study
group
compiled
newspapers
with
a
circulation
of
over
50,000.
how
often
conceivably,
it
might
be
demonstrated
that
a
reporter’s
privilege
is
desirable
for
that
segment
of
the
media.
it
may
well
not
be
desirable
on
balance
to
the
right
such
protection
for
newspapers
with
as
smaller
circulation.
there
may
be
no
problem
of
drawing
up
of
new
sources,
or
drawing
up
of
new
stories,
i’m
revealing
with
the
smaller
segment
of
the
smaller
circulation,
or
what
about
newsletters
for
example,
college
newspapers.
we
think
that
if
there
is
really
a
difficulty
with
respect
to
drawing
up
the
sources.
and
we
point
out
again
that
the
news
media
have
enabled
to
exist
for
200
years
without
any
constitutional
privilege,
and
without
a
drawing
up
of
sources.
but
if
there
is
a
difficulty
along
those
lines,
we
think
that
it’s
for
the
legislature
to
determine
on
an
informed
judgment,
looking
at
the
different
particular
problems
with
respect
to
different
media,
and
to
meet
that
difficulty
in
that
way.
we
don’t
believe
that
the
right
approach
is
a
constitutional
privilege
that
is
to
be
confined
to
a
particular
class
of
citizenry
that
is
news
reporters
as
such.
there
is
also
a
difficulty
as
to
what
is
a
reporter
which
has
been
pointed
out,
and
who
would
be
covered
along
those
lines.
to
our
knowledge,
this
court
has
never
recognized
in
the
first
amendment
or
in
any
other
amendment
in
the
bill
of
rights,
any
special
rights
or
privileges
that
apply
to
a
special
class
of
citizen,
and
we
do
not
think
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
do
so
here.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the

the
question
here
is

first

for

class
of

this
morning,
that
anybody
who’s
called
before
a
grand
jury,
is
going
to
have
some
adverse
effect
on
first
amendment
interests,
either
speech,
or
associational
ties,
or
press.
but
the
area
of
this
potential
conflict
is
an
exceedingly
narrow
one.
it’s
an
area
that
deals
only
with
question
of
criminal
activity.
and
in
that
narrow
area,
we
think
that
the
framers
of
the
constitution,
in
reconciling
the
broad
public
interest
in
having
a
grand
jury
with
these
broad
investigatorial
powers.
and
the
first
amendment
interest
that
might
be
indirectly
affected,
by
calling
in
people
to
appear
before
grand
juries,
that
they
apparently
determine
that
there
should
be
no
alternation
of
the
general
requirement,
that
people
appear
and
give
testimony
before
grand
juries.
now
they
did
write
an
exception
into
the
fifth
amendment.
the
exception
against
self-incrimination,
but
there
is
no
exception
written
into
the
first
amendment.
we
think
that
the
very
direct
effect
that
is
possible
on
first
amendment
interest
that
is
interest
of
speech
and
association,
which
are
in
our
view
far
more
direct
first
amendment
interest,
than
what
we
are
talking
about
here
which
is
a
more
remote
interest
in
newsgathering.
but
the
effect
on
those
direct
interest
by
appearing
before
the
grand
jury,
where
we
think
not
unforeseen
by
the
framers,
and
they
do
not
see
fit
to
rate
any
privilege
into
the
first
amendment.
and
we
don’t
believe
that
this
more
remote
interest
in
terms
of
newsgathering
is
one
that
would
require
that
we
now
create
a
new
privilege
in
the
first
amendment.
now,
we’ve
heard
a
lot
this
morning
about
the
fact
that
a
holding
by
this
court
the
effect
that
there
is
no
privilege
in
the
first
amendment
is
going
to
dry
up
news
sources.
the
news
media
in
this
country
have
of
course
existed
for
almost
200
years
without
a
constitutional
privilege
of
the
sort
of
thing
there
is
to
hear.
confidential
sources
have
long
been
used
in
the
newsgathering
process
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
in
many
areas?
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
what
is
worked
out?
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
think
that
that
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
think
that
that
is
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
think
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
the
function
of
those
guidelines,
that’s
correct
your
honor.
and
if
no
constitutional
privilege
is
recognized,
there
are
the
guidelines,
and
of
course
it
will
continue
as
mr.
justice
marshall
suggested
to
have
the
same
kind
of
negotiations.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
do
your
honor.
i
don’t
think
there
is
a
distinction
along
those
lines.
as
far
as
the
drawing
up
of
the
sources,
this
claim,
we
might
point
out,
is
being
made
by
a
certain
segment
of
the
media,
by
in
these
cases,
essentially
the
large
metropolitan
newspapers,
by
amicus
briefs
the
large
major
tv
networks.
and
that
professor
blazy’s
(ph)
report
that
has
been
referred
to
yesterday,
talks
also
in
terms
of
as
his
study
group
compiled
newspapers
with
a
circulation
of
over
50,000.
how
often
conceivably,
it
might
be
demonstrated
that
a
reporter’s
privilege
is
desirable
for
that
segment
of
the
media.
it
may
well
not
be
desirable
on
balance
to
the
right
such
protection
for
newspapers
with
as
smaller
circulation.
there
may
be
no
problem
of
drawing
up
of
new
sources,
or
drawing
up
of
new
stories,
i’m
revealing
with
the
smaller
segment
of
the
smaller
circulation,
or
what
about
newsletters
for
example,
college
newspapers.
we
think
that
if
there
is
really
a
difficulty
with
respect
to
drawing
up
the
sources.
and
we
point
out
again
that
the
news
media
have
enabled
to
exist
for
200
years
without
any
constitutional
privilege,
and
without
a
drawing
up
of
sources.
but
if
there
is
a
difficulty
along
those
lines,
we
think
that
it’s
for
the
legislature
to
determine
on
an
informed
judgment,
looking
at
the
different
particular
problems
with
respect
to
different
media,
and
to
meet
that
difficulty
in
that
way.
we
don’t
believe
that
the
right
approach
is
a
constitutional
privilege
that
is
to
be
confined
to
a
particular
class
of
citizenry
that
is
news
reporters
as
such.
there
is
also
a
difficulty
as
to
what
is
a
reporter
which
has
been
pointed
out,
and
who
would
be
covered
along
those
lines.
to
our
knowledge,
this
court
has
never
recognized
in
the
first
amendment
or
in
any
other
amendment
in
the
bill
of
rights,
any
special
rights
or
privileges
that
apply
to
a
special
class
of
citizen,
and
we
do
not
think
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
do
so
here.
