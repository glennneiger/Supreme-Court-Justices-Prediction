mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
zingman
has,
i
believe
generally
stated
the
facts
in
the
case
and
the
procedure
by
which
these
facts
have
come
to
the
supreme
court
of
united
states.
i
do
believe
however,
that
some
amplification
is
needed
in
certain
areas
and
will
attempt
to
do
that
before
i
get
into
a
discussion
of
the
issues,
which
i
believe
have
been
raised
here.
the
article
involved
--
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
that’s
correct
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
yes.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
that
of
course
would
be
a
protection
under
the
first
amendment.
that
is
freedom
of
religion.
i
could
see
how
an
argument
could
be
made
to
this
court
along
those
lines.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
you
mean
as
a
general
principle?
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
no.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
no.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
a
very
interesting
argument
mr.
justice
douglas,
could
be
made
to
this
court
on
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment
on
a
religious
--
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
i
did
not
mean
by
writing
a
short
brief,
mr.
justice
douglas,
to
give
the
impression
that
i
was
writing
or
thinking
that
this
was
a
frivolous
matter.
indeed,
i
might
apologize
to
the
court
by
saying
that
as
chief
prosecutor
in
my
community,
indeed,
i
have
many,
many
cases
and
i
believe
that
sometimes
brevity
in
bringing
forth
your
argument
is
as
forceful,
perhaps
as
an
exhaustive
survey
of
the
cases
in
any
particular
field
or
area.
i
would
call
the
attention
of
the
court
to
the
cases
that
have
been
cited
in
connection
with
some
of
the
questions
that
the
court
has
asked.
i
did
want
to
--
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
variety
versus
lead
(ph)
is
cited.
that
is
a
case
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
kentucky
--
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
--
which
holds
that
the
press
has
no
more
rights
under
the
constitution,
than
a
citizen,
and
this
is
one
of
the
questions
which
i
believe
has
been
directed
to
counsel
in
this
case.
i
think
that
it
is
extremely
important
part
of
this
presentation.
i
would
like
to
continue
with
the
presentation
of
my
argument,
and
call
the
attention
of
the
court
to
krs
421.100.
now,
this
particular
statute
states
impertinent
part
that
no
person
shall
be
compelled
to
disclose
in
any
legal
proceeding
or
trial
before
any
court.
or
before
any
grand
or
petty
jury.
or
before
the
presiding
officer
of
any
tribunal
or
his
agent,
or
agents.
or
before
the
general
assembly
or
any
committee
thereof.
or
before
any
city
or
county
legislative
body
in
any
committee
thereof,
or
elsewhere
the
source
of
any
information,
procured
or
obtained
by
him,
and
published
on
a
newspaper,
or
by
a
radio,
or
television
broadcasting
station,
by
which
he
is
engaged
or
employed,
or
with
which
he
is
connected.
as
you
can
see,
by
this,
kentucky
has
adopted
by
statute,
a
protection
for
newsman
--
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
the
case
decided
in
branzburg
v.
hayes,
mr.
justice
marshall,
held
that
the
protection
does
apply
except
in
the
instance
of
where
the
newsman
is
an
actual
witness
to
the
crime.
and
in
that
case,
the
court
felt
that
there
was
a
distinction
in
his
position
that
the
grand
jury
has
the
obligation
--
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
that
is
correct
it
does
not
apply.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
we
raised
this
question
in
our
brief
as
to
just
how
this
case
arrived
at
the
supreme
court
which
was
a
matter
of
some
concern
to
us
in
our
brief,
because
the
judge
held
in
the
court
below
that
the
petitioner
had
abandoned
his
argument
on
the
first
amendment,
but
we
are
here
now
--
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
no,
there
are
two
cases
here
mr.
justice
--
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
there
are
two
cases
involved.
the
first
case
was
precipitated
in
1969.
the
second
case
was
a
year
later
in
a
community
some
50
miles
away
from
where
the
first
case
arose.
and
the
in
second
case,
you
are
absolutely
correct.
the
question
was
taken
up,
and
that’s
the
case
involving
branzburg
v.
meigs.
that
question
was
before
the
court
of
appeals,
and
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
rejected
the
caldwell
decision,
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
yes,
they
mentioned
that
before
judge
pound
as
i
recall,
but
then
later
on
in
argument
before
the
court,
and
if
you
will
note
in
the
courts
of
appeals
decision
involving
meigs,
it
specifically
referred
to,
and
i
referred
to
the
portion
of
the
appendix
where
the
court
claimed,
that
they
abandoned
this
particular
argument.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
that’s
correct!
the
one
part
of
the
argument
made
here,
which
i
would
like
to
refer
to
at
the
present
time,
has
to
do
with
an
apparent
view
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner
that
somehow
the
grand
jury
is
an
alter
ego
of
the
police.
somehow
that
the
grand
jury
is
not
acting
on
its
own,
but
is
in
the
business
of
acquiring
information,
acquiring
information
for
the
benefit
of
prosecution.
this
is
not
the
case
certainly
in
kentucky.
contrary
to
an
inference
that
has
been
made
by
council,
the
grand
juries
in
kentucky
are
not
operated
any
differently
from
grand
juries
throughout
the
country.
we
have
12
a
year,
and
there
are
12
that
people
chosen
through
our
system
of
jury
selection.
these
people
are
interested
in
the
enforcement
of
the
laws
of
the
state
of
kentucky.
they
are
also
interested
in
the
protection
of
the
innocent
as
well,
and
if
the
grand
jury
believes
that
there
is
insufficient
evidence
to
show
probable
cause
that
an
offense
has
been
committed,
or
that
this
person
committed
it,
certainly
that
indictment
is
going
to
be
dismissed.
and
this
is
a
far
cry
from
saying
that
one
of
the
greatest
dangers
we
have
is
that
the
press
will
be
made
an
arm
of
the
grand
jury.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
excuse
me,
on
the
prosecution,
i’m
very
sorry.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
often
it
does,
and
that
--
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
that’s
correct.[laughter]
and
i’ve
had
the
pleasure
of
investigating
the
police
department
myself,
and
that
capacity
as
servant
to
the
grand
jury.
so
that
is
very
true.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
no.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
no.
during
the
terms
in
the
smaller
judicial
districts,
but
every
month
in
courts
of
continuous
session
as
we
have.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
120.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
no,
mr.
justice
douglas,
the
prosecution
does
not
use
the
news
media
for
this
purpose.
indeed,
we
had
an
unusual
situation
where
the
grand
jury
had
some
of
its
sessions
in
the
building
of
a
local
newspaper
during
a
recent
incident.
but
this
does
not
have
any
application
here,
and
i
am
not
just
saying
this
by
anyway
inferring
that
the
petitioners
will
use
the
grand
jury
in
any
section
of
manner
that
were
not
supposed
to,
but
as
i
see
it,
the
newsman
has
no
more
privilege
under
the
law
than
the
average
citizen.
there
is
of
course,
a
chilling
effect
upon
any
use
of
the
law
if
the
grand
jury
goes
out,
and
subpoenas
someone
and
asks
them
a
question,
and
citizens
observed
that
person
going
before
the
grand
jury.
certainly,
there
is
some
effect
that
might
develop
from
this,
but
isn’t
this
something
that
we
have
to
accept
as
a
part
of
our
obligations
as
citizens?
i
will
call
the
attention
to
the
court
of
the
procedure,
which
have
been
suggested
by
council
in
his
discussion
of
how
you
would
have
this
open
hearing
to
determine
whether
a
newsman
would
be
subpoenaed,
which
they
referred
to
the
same
type
of
procedure
that
we
would
use
in
determining
fifth
amendment
privileges.
the
fifth
amendment
applies
to
everyone.
the
fifth
amendment
does
not
merely
apply
to
a
newsman
or
any
group
of
newsmen.
also,
we’d
like
to
call
the
attention
to
the
court
of
the
reasons
why
the
informants
gave
their
information
to
the
newsman,
and
it’s
in
the
brief.
he
wanted
to
bug
the
narcotics
agents
involved
in
the
community.
this,
it
appears
to
be
a
reason
not
quite
as
important,
as
some
of
the
reasons
that
i
have
developed
in
other
privileges
under
the
law
that
we
noticed.
certainly,
bugging
the
narcotics
agents,
his
purpose
in
giving
the
information,
is
not
the
type
of
a
privilege,
or
should
not
go
to
consider
the
type
of
privilege
that
is
being
requested
here.
the
petitioner
has
suggested
these
different
tests
to
be
made.
i
will
take
the
position
that
this
would
fetter
the
grand
jury
process
to
the
point
that
it
would
have
a
substantial
effect
upon
the
operation
of
the
grand
jury.
the
grand
jury
certainly
has
deep
roots
in
constitutional
law.
they
have
a
constitutional
duty
to
investigate
just
as
the
press
has
the
freedoms,
as
any
other
citizen.
when
these
two
meet,
under
these
circumstances,
certainly
doesn’t
the
grand
jury
that
acts
for
all
of
the
people,
doesn’t
their
constitutional
duty
carry
a
heavier
weight
in
this
connection
and
the
corresponding
privilege,
which
is
advanced
here
by
counsel.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
only
the
fifth
amendment
would
apply,
that
is
our
position
for
constitutional
reason.
now
there
are
privileges
that
are
set
out
by
statute,
and
the
wigmore
discusses
privileges
and
the
different
types,
and
his
feeling
is
that
privileges
should
not
be
advanced.
he
thinks
that
the
more
privileges
you
have,
the
more
difficult
it
is
to
administer
the
law,
and
certainly,
i
think
that
in
this
instance,
kentucky
has
passed
a
statute
--
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
i
have
not
mr.
justice
douglas,
been
to
russia.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
i
would
never
want
to
have
such
a
situation
occur
in
this
country,
and
i
agree
wholeheartedly
with
the
statute
which
has
been
passed
by
the
legislature
of
kentucky
granting
to
the
press
a
privilege,
a
legislative
act.
they
have
a
privilege,
but
i
also
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
when
the
reporter
starts
to
transcend
from
a
receiver
of
information
to
a
witness
to
a
serious
crime,
which
i
might
say
was
a
felony
at
the
time
that
the
investigation
began
in
1969,
but
today
by
change
of
statute,
is
now
a
misdemeanor.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
if
we
assumed
that
that
is
a
function
of
the
grand
jury,
to
be
an
arm
of
the
government
--
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
you
mean
that
each
of
these
agencies
would
thereby
employ
the
press
to
do
their
job
for
them.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
--
that
ends
up
(laughter).
well,
i
don’t
think
that
i
would
use
the
same
analogy
with
arms
of
government
who
are
out
attempting
to
obtain
information.
the
grand
jury
has
its
roots
different
from
that.
it
has
additional
obligations
under
the
law
and
set
out
in
the
constitution,
which
makes
it
independent,
and
this
is
the
reason
why
i
suggested
this.
i
feel
that
throughout
argument
on
this,
that
the
grand
jury
has
been
placed
in
a
position
before
this
court,
in
view
of
the
petitioner,
that
it
somehow
an
arm
of
the
commonwealth,
and
i
will
not
agree
with
this.
i
think
that
the
corresponding
constitutional
obligations
of
the
grand
jury
as
far
as
the
defendant
is
concerned,
are
just
as
important
as
for
the
prosecution.
so
how
can
we
say
that
the
grand
jury
is
an
arm
and
alter
ego
of
the
commonwealth?
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
not
necessarily.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
if
the
newspaper
reporters
observed
a
crime,
the
commission
of
a
crime,
they
become
a
witness
and
they
have
a
duty,
and
a
responsibility
to
testify
in
a
court
of
law.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
they
are
subject
to
being
subpoenaed
before
the
grand
jury.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
that’s
correct.
just
like
you
would
subpoena
a
husband
in
kentucky,
or
wife
in
connection
with
the
case,
or
you
would
subpoena
someone
else
with
some
privilege.
they
would
raise
that
privilege
in
a
particular
communication
involved
in
the
court
of
law.
whether
it
be
before
the
grand
jury
or
whether
it
be
before
the
petit
jury.
they
have
a
right.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
it
was
denied
--
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
only
if
there
is
an
indication
that
he
is
also
a
witness
to
the
crime
in
kentucky.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
he
was
told
--
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
no,
but
this
case
is
one
where
--
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
confidential
information
and
also
the
reporter
witnessed
the
compounding
of
hashish,
the
combining
together
the
elements
of
that
drug
which
is
a
felony
in
kentucky,
and
under
the
circumstances,
there
is
an
overriding,
certainly
an
overriding
need
that
these
individuals
be
brought
to
justice
under
our
law.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
the
present
law,
as
from
common
law
does
not
grant
a
privilege,
first
amendment
privilege
to
the
newsman,
anymore
than
in
any
other
occupation,
any
specialized
occupation.
and
so
i
cannot
see
how
that
the
situation
can
be
worst
than
it
is
right
now,
if
the
privilege
is
not
extended
to
newsman.
i
think
one
of
the
most
important
arguments
to
make
to
the
court,
is
in
connection
with
the
constitutional
rights
of
individuals
as
opposed
to
groups,
sole
groups,
individual
groups
that
may
have
certain
interests,
and
in
this
connection
the
media,
has
interests
,which
they
want
to
protect.
and
certainly
the
media
is
extremely
important
in
our
society
today
--
but
no
law
to
the
supreme
--
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
sources
of
information
will
be
dried
out.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
this
instance,
within
a
few
months
after
the
action
taken
by
judge
pound.
the
same
newspaper
reporter
went
50
miles
away
from
our
community
and
published
an
entirely
new
article
in
the
same
subject
matter.
and
apparently
had
no
difficulty
in
getting
individuals
in
that
community,
within
the
range
of
that
newspaper,
to
give
him
all
sorts
of
information.
now,
i
might
say
that
if
the
reporter
had
appeared
before
the
grand
jury
in
meigs,
instead
of
refusing
to
appear.
my
opinion,
the
court
would
have
sustained
his
privilege
under
421.100.
i
am
not
saying
here
that
he
does
not
have
a
privilege,
but
what
i’m
saying
is
that
when
he
turns
from
a
reporter
to
a
witness,
when
he
becomes
a
witness
to
a
crime
at
that
point.
there
is
an
overriding
need
that
he
performed
his
duty
as
a
citizen,
appear
before
the
grand
jury,
which
has
the
constitutional
responsibility
of
going
into
these
crimes,
investigating
these
crimes,
and
testifying.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
well
in
kentucky,
it’s
a
statutory
privilege
that
exists.
i
would
argue
that
there
is
no
first
amendment
privilege
on
the
part
on
a
newspaper
reporter
to
refuse
to
answer
questions
in
connection
with
offenses
that
he
has
witnessed.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
i
believe
that
he
probably
modeled
that
ordered
after
caldwell.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
i
do
not
agree
with
the
caldwell
decision.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
yes,
but
when
he
granted
the
privilege
that
he
could
consult
with
counsel
in
connection
with
it
this
of
course
is
not
in
our
statute.
there
were
other
portions
of
it,
which
led
me
to
believe
that
what
he
did
was,
that
he
modeled
the
protective
order
from
the
same
protective
order
that
we
find
in
caldwell.
and
i
think
that
when
the
case
went
to
the
court
of
appeals,
they
made
their
decision
on
whether
or
not
caldwell
will
be
the
proper
law
in
kentucky.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
that’s
correct.
the
counsel
that
argued
the
meigs
case
in
the
court
of
appeals
did
not,
i
don’t
believe
filed
a
brief
with
this
particular
court.
i
argued
the
case
for
judge
hayes,
and
did
file
a
brief
short
to
what
they’ve
been.
actually,
the
argument
that
the
press
makes
that
they
can’t
get
information
anymore,
indicate
that
the
problem
in
recent
years,
there’s
been
an
increased
activity
on
the
part
of
prosecutors
in
this
connection.
i
do
not
believe
is
supported
by
the
facts,
certainly,
there
has
been
an
effort
made
by
grand
juries
in
recent
years
to
do
their
job,
but
i
do
not
conclude
thereby,
that
it
is
strictly
because
of
the
action
of
government,
or
the
action
of
grand
juries,
we’ve
had
a
considerable
amount
of
publicity.
much,
much
more,
in
connection
with
the
operation,
or
the
commission
of
crimes
in
recent
years,
and
this
of
course
is
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing.
i
don’t
want
the
court
to
get
the
impression
that
i’m
arguing
that,
but
i’m
saying
that
the
responsibility,
the
constitutional
responsibility
of
this
grand
jury,
to
investigate
not
only
for
the
benefit
of
the
people.
but
certainly
for
the
benefit
of
a
defendant
who
may
or
may
not
be
charged,
depending
upon
whether
probable
cause
has
been
properly
shown
to
that
grand
jury
is
an
overriding
importance.
and
indeed,
if
we
had
a
system
whereby
we
had
to
apply
in
open
court,
in
order
to
get
a
subpoena,
if
we
had
to
go
to
the
judge
at
open
court
and
apply,
there
would
be
no
question
that
the
grand
jury
would
be
fettered.
because
the
pledge
of
secrecy
which
we
have
in
the
grand
jury
is
also
a
protection,
and
in
an
open
hearing,
what
does
this
do
to
the
pledge
of
secrecy?
is
the
suggestion
made
that
this
should
be
done
perhaps,
because
the
media
would
want
more
publicity
concerning
that
reporters
testifying
before
the
grand
jury,
i
don’t
know.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
they
can
be.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
not
uniformly.
the
grand
jury
has
the
right
to
choose
its
own
legal
adviser
in
kentucky,
and
there
are
instances
of
where
the
grand
jury
has
chosen
--
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
its
legal
adviser.
they
serve
the
grand
jury,
and
give
recommendations
to
that
grand
jury.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
zingman
has,
i
believe
generally
stated
the
facts
in
the
case
and
the
procedure
by
which
these
facts
have
come
to
the
supreme
court
of
united
states.
i
do
believe
however,
that
some
amplification
is
needed
in
certain
areas
and
will
attempt
to
do
that
before
i
get
into
a
discussion
of
the
issues,
which
i
believe
have
been
raised
here.
the
article
involved
--
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
that’s
correct
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
yes.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
that
of
course
would
be
a
protection
under
the
first
amendment.
that
is
freedom
of
religion.
i
could
see
how
an
argument
could
be
made
to
this
court
along
those
lines.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
you
mean
as
a
general
principle?
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
no.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
no.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
a
very
interesting
argument
mr.
justice
douglas,
could
be
made
to
this
court
on
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment
on
a
religious
--
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
i
did
not
mean
by
writing
a
short
brief,
mr.
justice
douglas,
to
give
the
impression
that
i
was
writing
or
thinking
that
this
was
a
frivolous
matter.
indeed,
i
might
apologize
to
the
court
by
saying
that
as
chief
prosecutor
in
my
community,
indeed,
i
have
many,
many
cases
and
i
believe
that
sometimes
brevity
in
bringing
forth
your
argument
is
as
forceful,
perhaps
as
an
exhaustive
survey
of
the
cases
in
any
particular
field
or
area.
i
would
call
the
attention
of
the
court
to
the
cases
that
have
been
cited
in
connection
with
some
of
the
questions
that
the
court
has
asked.
i
did
want
to
--
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
variety
versus
lead
(ph)
is
cited.
that
is
a
case
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
kentucky
--
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
--
which
holds
that
the
press
has
no
more
rights
under
the
constitution,
than
a
citizen,
and
this
is
one
of
the
questions
which
i
believe
has
been
directed
to
counsel
in
this
case.
i
think
that
it
is
extremely
important
part
of
this
presentation.
i
would
like
to
continue
with
the
presentation
of
my
argument,
and
call
the
attention
of
the
court
to
krs
421.100.
now,
this
particular
statute
states
impertinent
part
that
no
person
shall
be
compelled
to
disclose
in
any
legal
proceeding
or
trial
before
any
court.
or
before
any
grand
or
petty
jury.
or
before
the
presiding
officer
of
any
tribunal
or
his
agent,
or
agents.
or
before
the
general
assembly
or
any
committee
thereof.
or
before
any
city
or
county
legislative
body
in
any
committee
thereof,
or
elsewhere
the
source
of
any
information,
procured
or
obtained
by
him,
and
published
on
a
newspaper,
or
by
a
radio,
or
television
broadcasting
station,
by
which
he
is
engaged
or
employed,
or
with
which
he
is
connected.
as
you
can
see,
by
this,
kentucky
has
adopted
by
statute,
a
protection
for
newsman
--
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
the
case
decided
in
branzburg
v.
hayes,
mr.
justice
marshall,
held
that
the
protection
does
apply
except
in
the
instance
of
where
the
newsman
is
an
actual
witness
to
the
crime.
and
in
that
case,
the
court
felt
that
there
was
a
distinction
in
his
position
that
the
grand
jury
has
the
obligation
--
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
that
is
correct
it
does
not
apply.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
we
raised
this
question
in
our
brief
as
to
just
how
this
case
arrived
at
the
supreme
court
which
was
a
matter
of
some
concern
to
us
in
our
brief,
because
the
judge
held
in
the
court
below
that
the
petitioner
had
abandoned
his
argument
on
the
first
amendment,
but
we
are
here
now
--
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
no,
there
are
two
cases
here
mr.
justice
--
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
there
are
two
cases
involved.
the
first
case
was
precipitated
in
1969.
the
second
case
was
a
year
later
in
a
community
some
50
miles
away
from
where
the
first
case
arose.
and
the
in
second
case,
you
are
absolutely
correct.
the
question
was
taken
up,
and
that’s
the
case
involving
branzburg
v.
meigs.
that
question
was
before
the
court
of
appeals,
and
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
rejected
the
caldwell
decision,
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
yes,
they
mentioned
that
before
judge
pound
as
i
recall,
but
then
later
on
in
argument
before
the
court,
and
if
you
will
note
in
the
courts
of
appeals
decision
involving
meigs,
it
specifically
referred
to,
and
i
referred
to
the
portion
of
the
appendix
where
the
court
claimed,
that
they
abandoned
this
particular
argument.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
that’s
correct!
the
one
part
of
the
argument
made
here,
which
i
would
like
to
refer
to
at
the
present
time,
has
to
do
with
an
apparent
view
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner
that
somehow
the
grand
jury
is
an
alter
ego
of
the
police.
somehow
that
the
grand
jury
is
not
acting
on
its
own,
but
is
in
the
business
of
acquiring
information,
acquiring
information
for
the
benefit
of
prosecution.
this
is
not
the
case
certainly
in
kentucky.
contrary
to
an
inference
that
has
been
made
by
council,
the
grand
juries
in
kentucky
are
not
operated
any
differently
from
grand
juries
throughout
the
country.
we
have
12
a
year,
and
there
are
12
that
people
chosen
through
our
system
of
jury
selection.
these
people
are
interested
in
the
enforcement
of
the
laws
of
the
state
of
kentucky.
they
are
also
interested
in
the
protection
of
the
innocent
as
well,
and
if
the
grand
jury
believes
that
there
is
insufficient
evidence
to
show
probable
cause
that
an
offense
has
been
committed,
or
that
this
person
committed
it,
certainly
that
indictment
is
going
to
be
dismissed.
and
this
is
a
far
cry
from
saying
that
one
of
the
greatest
dangers
we
have
is
that
the
press
will
be
made
an
arm
of
the
grand
jury.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
excuse
me,
on
the
prosecution,
i’m
very
sorry.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
often
it
does,
and
that
--
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
that’s
correct.[laughter]
and
i’ve
had
the
pleasure
of
investigating
the
police
department
myself,
and
that
capacity
as
servant
to
the
grand
jury.
so
that
is
very
true.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
no.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
no.
during
the
terms
in
the
smaller
judicial
districts,
but
every
month
in
courts
of
continuous
session
as
we
have.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
120.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
no,
mr.
justice
douglas,
the
prosecution
does
not
use
the
news
media
for
this
purpose.
indeed,
we
had
an
unusual
situation
where
the
grand
jury
had
some
of
its
sessions
in
the
building
of
a
local
newspaper
during
a
recent
incident.
but
this
does
not
have
any
application
here,
and
i
am
not
just
saying
this
by
anyway
inferring
that
the
petitioners
will
use
the
grand
jury
in
any
section
of
manner
that
were
not
supposed
to,
but
as
i
see
it,
the
newsman
has
no
more
privilege
under
the
law
than
the
average
citizen.
there
is
of
course,
a
chilling
effect
upon
any
use
of
the
law
if
the
grand
jury
goes
out,
and
subpoenas
someone
and
asks
them
a
question,
and
citizens
observed
that
person
going
before
the
grand
jury.
certainly,
there
is
some
effect
that
might
develop
from
this,
but
isn’t
this
something
that
we
have
to
accept
as
a
part
of
our
obligations
as
citizens?
i
will
call
the
attention
to
the
court
of
the
procedure,
which
have
been
suggested
by
council
in
his
discussion
of
how
you
would
have
this
open
hearing
to
determine
whether
a
newsman
would
be
subpoenaed,
which
they
referred
to
the
same
type
of
procedure
that
we
would
use
in
determining
fifth
amendment
privileges.
the
fifth
amendment
applies
to
everyone.
the
fifth
amendment
does
not
merely
apply
to
a
newsman
or
any
group
of
newsmen.
also,
we’d
like
to
call
the
attention
to
the
court
of
the
reasons
why
the
informants
gave
their
information
to
the
newsman,
and
it’s
in
the
brief.
he
wanted
to
bug
the
narcotics
agents
involved
in
the
community.
this,
it
appears
to
be
a
reason
not
quite
as
important,
as
some
of
the
reasons
that
i
have
developed
in
other
privileges
under
the
law
that
we
noticed.
certainly,
bugging
the
narcotics
agents,
his
purpose
in
giving
the
information,
is
not
the
type
of
a
privilege,
or
should
not
go
to
consider
the
type
of
privilege
that
is
being
requested
here.
the
petitioner
has
suggested
these
different
tests
to
be
made.
i
will
take
the
position
that
this
would
fetter
the
grand
jury
process
to
the
point
that
it
would
have
a
substantial
effect
upon
the
operation
of
the
grand
jury.
the
grand
jury
certainly
has
deep
roots
in
constitutional
law.
they
have
a
constitutional
duty
to
investigate
just
as
the
press
has
the
freedoms,
as
any
other
citizen.
when
these
two
meet,
under
these
circumstances,
certainly
doesn’t
the
grand
jury
that
acts
for
all
of
the
people,
doesn’t
their
constitutional
duty
carry
a
heavier
weight
in
this
connection
and
the
corresponding
privilege,
which
is
advanced
here
by
counsel.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
only
the
fifth
amendment
would
apply,
that
is
our
position
for
constitutional
reason.
now
there
are
privileges
that
are
set
out
by
statute,
and
the
wigmore
discusses
privileges
and
the
different
types,
and
his
feeling
is
that
privileges
should
not
be
advanced.
he
thinks
that
the
more
privileges
you
have,
the
more
difficult
it
is
to
administer
the
law,
and
certainly,
i
think
that
in
this
instance,
kentucky
has
passed
a
statute
--
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
i
have
not
mr.
justice
douglas,
been
to
russia.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
i
would
never
want
to
have
such
a
situation
occur
in
this
country,
and
i
agree
wholeheartedly
with
the
statute
which
has
been
passed
by
the
legislature
of
kentucky
granting
to
the
press
a
privilege,
a
legislative
act.
they
have
a
privilege,
but
i
also
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
when
the
reporter
starts
to
transcend
from
a
receiver
of
information
to
a
witness
to
a
serious
crime,
which
i
might
say
was
a
felony
at
the
time
that
the
investigation
began
in
1969,
but
today
by
change
of
statute,
is
now
a
misdemeanor.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
if
we
assumed
that
that
is
a
function
of
the
grand
jury,
to
be
an
arm
of
the
government
--
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
you
mean
that
each
of
these
agencies
would
thereby
employ
the
press
to
do
their
job
for
them.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
--
that
ends
up
(laughter).
well,
i
don’t
think
that
i
would
use
the
same
analogy
with
arms
of
government
who
are
out
attempting
to
obtain
information.
the
grand
jury
has
its
roots
different
from
that.
it
has
additional
obligations
under
the
law
and
set
out
in
the
constitution,
which
makes
it
independent,
and
this
is
the
reason
why
i
suggested
this.
i
feel
that
throughout
argument
on
this,
that
the
grand
jury
has
been
placed
in
a
position
before
this
court,
in
view
of
the
petitioner,
that
it
somehow
an
arm
of
the
commonwealth,
and
i
will
not
agree
with
this.
i
think
that
the
corresponding
constitutional
obligations
of
the
grand
jury
as
far
as
the
defendant
is
concerned,
are
just
as
important
as
for
the
prosecution.
so
how
can
we
say
that
the
grand
jury
is
an
arm
and
alter
ego
of
the
commonwealth?
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
not
necessarily.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
if
the
newspaper
reporters
observed
a
crime,
the
commission
of
a
crime,
they
become
a
witness
and
they
have
a
duty,
and
a
responsibility
to
testify
in
a
court
of
law.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
they
are
subject
to
being
subpoenaed
before
the
grand
jury.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
that’s
correct.
just
like
you
would
subpoena
a
husband
in
kentucky,
or
wife
in
connection
with
the
case,
or
you
would
subpoena
someone
else
with
some
privilege.
they
would
raise
that
privilege
in
a
particular
communication
involved
in
the
court
of
law.
whether
it
be
before
the
grand
jury
or
whether
it
be
before
the
petit
jury.
they
have
a
right.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
it
was
denied
--
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
only
if
there
is
an
indication
that
he
is
also
a
witness
to
the
crime
in
kentucky.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
he
was
told
--
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
no,
but
this
case
is
one
where
--
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
confidential
information
and
also
the
reporter
witnessed
the
compounding
of
hashish,
the
combining
together
the
elements
of
that
drug
which
is
a
felony
in
kentucky,
and
under
the
circumstances,
there
is
an
overriding,
certainly
an
overriding
need
that
these
individuals
be
brought
to
justice
under
our
law.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
the
present
law,
as
from
common
law
does
not
grant
a
privilege,
first
amendment
privilege
to
the
newsman,
anymore
than
in
any
other
occupation,
any
specialized
occupation.
and
so
i
cannot
see
how
that
the
situation
can
be
worst
than
it
is
right
now,
if
the
privilege
is
not
extended
to
newsman.
i
think
one
of
the
most
important
arguments
to
make
to
the
court,
is
in
connection
with
the
constitutional
rights
of
individuals
as
opposed
to
groups,
sole
groups,
individual
groups
that
may
have
certain
interests,
and
in
this
connection
the
media,
has
interests
,which
they
want
to
protect.
and
certainly
the
media
is
extremely
important
in
our
society
today
--
but
no
law
to
the
supreme
--
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
sources
of
information
will
be
dried
out.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
this
instance,
within
a
few
months
after
the
action
taken
by
judge
pound.
the
same
newspaper
reporter
went
50
miles
away
from
our
community
and
published
an
entirely
new
article
in
the
same
subject
matter.
and
apparently
had
no
difficulty
in
getting
individuals
in
that
community,
within
the
range
of
that
newspaper,
to
give
him
all
sorts
of
information.
now,
i
might
say
that
if
the
reporter
had
appeared
before
the
grand
jury
in
meigs,
instead
of
refusing
to
appear.
my
opinion,
the
court
would
have
sustained
his
privilege
under
421.100.
i
am
not
saying
here
that
he
does
not
have
a
privilege,
but
what
i’m
saying
is
that
when
he
turns
from
a
reporter
to
a
witness,
when
he
becomes
a
witness
to
a
crime
at
that
point.
there
is
an
overriding
need
that
he
performed
his
duty
as
a
citizen,
appear
before
the
grand
jury,
which
has
the
constitutional
responsibility
of
going
into
these
crimes,
investigating
these
crimes,
and
testifying.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
well
in
kentucky,
it’s
a
statutory
privilege
that
exists.
i
would
argue
that
there
is
no
first
amendment
privilege
on
the
part
on
a
newspaper
reporter
to
refuse
to
answer
questions
in
connection
with
offenses
that
he
has
witnessed.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
i
believe
that
he
probably
modeled
that
ordered
after
caldwell.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
i
do
not
agree
with
the
caldwell
decision.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
yes,
but
when
he
granted
the
privilege
that
he
could
consult
with
counsel
in
connection
with
it
this
of
course
is
not
in
our
statute.
there
were
other
portions
of
it,
which
led
me
to
believe
that
what
he
did
was,
that
he
modeled
the
protective
order
from
the
same
protective
order
that
we
find
in
caldwell.
and
i
think
that
when
the
case
went
to
the
court
of
appeals,
they
made
their
decision
on
whether
or
not
caldwell
will
be
the
proper
law
in
kentucky.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
that’s
correct.
the
counsel
that
argued
the
meigs
case
in
the
court
of
appeals
did
not,
i
don’t
believe
filed
a
brief
with
this
particular
court.
i
argued
the
case
for
judge
hayes,
and
did
file
a
brief
short
to
what
they’ve
been.
actually,
the
argument
that
the
press
makes
that
they
can’t
get
information
anymore,
indicate
that
the
problem
in
recent
years,
there’s
been
an
increased
activity
on
the
part
of
prosecutors
in
this
connection.
i
do
not
believe
is
supported
by
the
facts,
certainly,
there
has
been
an
effort
made
by
grand
juries
in
recent
years
to
do
their
job,
but
i
do
not
conclude
thereby,
that
it
is
strictly
because
of
the
action
of
government,
or
the
action
of
grand
juries,
we’ve
had
a
considerable
amount
of
publicity.
much,
much
more,
in
connection
with
the
operation,
or
the
commission
of
crimes
in
recent
years,
and
this
of
course
is
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing.
i
don’t
want
the
court
to
get
the
impression
that
i’m
arguing
that,
but
i’m
saying
that
the
responsibility,
the
constitutional
responsibility
of
this
grand
jury,
to
investigate
not
only
for
the
benefit
of
the
people.
but
certainly
for
the
benefit
of
a
defendant
who
may
or
may
not
be
charged,
depending
upon
whether
probable
cause
has
been
properly
shown
to
that
grand
jury
is
an
overriding
importance.
and
indeed,
if
we
had
a
system
whereby
we
had
to
apply
in
open
court,
in
order
to
get
a
subpoena,
if
we
had
to
go
to
the
judge
at
open
court
and
apply,
there
would
be
no
question
that
the
grand
jury
would
be
fettered.
because
the
pledge
of
secrecy
which
we
have
in
the
grand
jury
is
also
a
protection,
and
in
an
open
hearing,
what
does
this
do
to
the
pledge
of
secrecy?
is
the
suggestion
made
that
this
should
be
done
perhaps,
because
the
media
would
want
more
publicity
concerning
that
reporters
testifying
before
the
grand
jury,
i
don’t
know.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
they
can
be.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
not
uniformly.
the
grand
jury
has
the
right
to
choose
its
own
legal
adviser
in
kentucky,
and
there
are
instances
of
where
the
grand
jury
has
chosen
--
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
its
legal
adviser.
they
serve
the
grand
jury,
and
give
recommendations
to
that
grand
jury.
mr.
edwin
a.
schroering,
jr.
thank
you.
