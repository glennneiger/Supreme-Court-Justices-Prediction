the
news
article,
there
was
only
one,
was
there?
justice
potter
stewart
one
appears
on
pages
3
and
5
of
the
appendix?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
first
one
was
published
in
the
louisville
courier
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
one
had
a
dateline
frankfurt.
that
was
the
one
beginning
in
page
30.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
local
--
am
i
right?
justice
potter
stewart
did
not
have
a
dateline,
but
it
is
a
local
story
in
the
local
paper?
justice
potter
stewart
throughout
the
state,
right.
justice
potter
stewart
as
we
are
talking
about
the
first
amendment,
the
first
amendment
protects
free
speech
as
well
as
it
does
in
free
press,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
suppose
your
argument
based
as
it
is
upon
the
first
amendment
could
not
logically
be
confined
to
newsman
however
defined.
i
suppose
every
one
of
us
is
protected
in
his
right
to
free
speech
and
the
right
to
speak.
also
includes
the
right
to
keep
silent.
i
suppose
logically
carried
to
its
conclusion,
your
argument
would
mean
that
anybody
would
be
protected
if
he
just
said,
"i
do
not
want
to
talk."
justice
potter
stewart
why
is
it
confined
to
a
newsman?
we
all
have
the
right
of
free
speech,
do
we
not?
justice
potter
stewart
why?
justice
potter
stewart
they
both
are
equally
protected
of
free
press
and
free
speech.
justice
potter
stewart
well
if
you’re
right,
it
would
be
a
direct
impingement
upon
a
person’s
right
of
free
speech,
because
the
right
of
free
speech
includes
the
right
to
keep
silent,
does
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
not
inhibiting
it
is
just
a
direct
violation
of
it,
if
you
are
right,
in
your
basic
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
it
never
has,
nor
has
this
court
ever
interpreted
the
right
of
free
press
to
include
the
right
of
a
newspaperman
to
defy
a
subpoena
of
a
grand
jury,
so
these
both
would
be
new
decisions?
justice
potter
stewart
it
certainly
does.
particularly
if
anything
told
to
an
individual
in
confidence
would
have
a
chilling
effect,
anybody
who
would
want
to
confide
in
a
friend
or
an
associate,
wouldn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it’s
very
fair
that
it
would,
isn’t
it?
just
to
mean,
if
your
argument
is
right
or
even
if
your
affidavit
is
right.
justice
potter
stewart
the
first
amendment
protects
them
both.
justice
potter
stewart
well
mr.
zingman,
i
didn’t
understand
you
making
the
argument
that
your
balancing
test
has
even
comes
into
play,
unless
or
until
we
are
dealing
with
confidential
information,
is
that
true?
justice
potter
stewart
and
my
brother
rehnquist’s
question,
as
i
understood
it,
the
reporter
is
just
an
eyewitness
to
a
murder,
he
is
like
anybody
else
as
an
eyewitness
to
a
murder.
we
are
only
talking
here
about
something
that’s
acquired
by
a
journalist
in
a
confidential
capacity,
are
we
not?
justice
potter
stewart
maybe
i
did
also,
but
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
before
whom
should
that
hearing
be?
justice
potter
stewart
as
well
as
the
one
of
the
traditional
values
of
the
grand
jury
we’ve
always
thought
and
certainly
this
court
has
repeatedly
said,
is
that
it
is
not
and
should
not
be
controlled
by
judges
and
by
prosecutors,
or
by
anybody
else.
sometimes
it’s
a
corrupt
judge
that
the
grand
jury
is
investigating,
isn’t
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
grand
jury
of
citizens
to
act
and
to
investigate
without
any
limitations
imposed
upon
it
by
officials
has
been
thought
to
be
one
of
his
values
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
because
the
trial
judge
said,
"i
am
not
going
to
interfere
with
the
traditional
freedom
of
a
grand
jury."
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
there
may
be
even
lawyers
and
judges
have
been
saying
this
to
each
other
for
a
good
many
centuries.
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
of
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
grand
jury
often
investigates
the
police,
does
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
particularly,
in
certain
counties
of
kentucky,
in
our
experience.
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
a
grand
jury
empanelled,
you
say
every
month
in
each
county
in
kentucky?
justice
potter

or
did
i
not
