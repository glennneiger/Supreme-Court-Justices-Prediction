mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
appear
here
on
behalf
of
the
petition
of
paul
branzburg,
a
professional
journalist
employed
by
the
courier
journal,
a
daily
newspaper
published
in
louisville,
kentucky.
the
petitioner
seeks
reversal
on
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
ground
of
two
cases
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
kentucky,
in
the
first
of
these,
involving
the
respondent
hayes,
a
judge
in
the
trial
court
in
jefferson
county,
kentucky.
following
upon
publication
in
the
courier
journal
of
an
article
authored
by
the
petitioner,
which
described
the
manufacture
of
hashish
by
two
individuals
in
louisville,
kentucky,
in
which
in
the
body
of
the
article
contained
the
statement,
that
a
promise
had
been
given
by
the
petitioner
that
the
identity
of
the
two
individuals
would
be
maintained
confidential,
and
would
not
be
disclosed.
the
petitioner
was
subpoenaed
before
a
grand
jury,
sitting
in
jefferson
county,
kentucky,
and
was
asked
by
that
asked
by
that
grand
jury
two
questions
relating
to
the
identity
of
the
person
that
he
had
described
in
a
newspaper
article.
one
of
the
questions
asked
him
specifically,
"on
november
12
or
13,
1969,
who
was
the
person
or
persons
you
observed
in
possession
of
marijuana
about
which
you
wrote
an
article
in
the
courier
journal
on
november
15,
1969?"
the
second
question
was,
"on
november
13,
1969,
who
was
the
person
or
persons
you
observed
compounding
marijuana
producing
same
to
a
compound
known
as
hashish?"
this
appears
in
our
appendix
at
page
6.
the
petitioner
refused
to
answer
these
questions,
and
was
brought
before
the
predecessor
in
office
of
the
respondent
hayes,
a
trial
judge
by
the
name
of
pound,
and
upon
the
questions
being
read
to
the
judge,
the
petitioner
was
directed
to
answer
the
questions.
at
that
time
we
appeared
in
behalf
of
the
petitioner
and
asserted
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
grounds
under
the
concept
of
freedom
of
the
press
for
the
petitioner’s
refusal
to
answer
the
questions.
we
also
asserted
the
provisions
of
a
kentucky
shield
statute,
krs,
kentucky
revised
statutes
421.100,
which
is
phrased
in
language
that
protects
a
newsman
from
revealing
the
source
of
any
information
published
by
him.
the
trial
court
rejected
the
contentions
made
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner,
and
various
motions
for
writs
of
prohibition
and
for
stays
were
made
in
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals.
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
granted
a
temporary
stay
prohibiting
the
respondent’s
predecessor
in
office
from
proceeding
with
contempt
action
against
the
petitioner,
until
such
time
as
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
had
occasion
to
pass
on
the
merits
of
the
case.
the
case
was
subsequently
briefed
and
argued
to
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
on
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
grounds,
in
addition
to
the
provisions
of
the
kentucky
shield
statute.
in
november
of
1970,
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
delivered
an
opinion,
in
which
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
kentucky
shield
statue
did
not
protect
the
petitioner.
it
held
that
the
shield’s
statute
was
restricted
solely
to
informants,
information
and
protected
the
identity
of
informants,
but
where
the
reporter,
or
newsman
observed
at
firsthand
individuals
engaged
in
a
particular
activity
which
might
cause
to
the
crime
or
any
activity,
he
was
not
privileged
to
protect
the
identity
of
the
individuals
themselves,
a
position
which
seems
to
us
to
put
a
premium
on
second
hand
reporting
and
second
hand
sources
somewhat
incongruously.
shortly
after
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
opinion
was
delivered,
a
petition
for
reconsideration
was
filed
in
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals,
calling
to
that
court’s
attention.
the
fact
that
they
had
made
no
comment
upon
our
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
arguments,
and
citing
to
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
caldwell
against
the
united
states.
the
appeal
of
which
was
argued
before
this
court
yesterday.
while
that
was
pending
before
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals,
another
article
authored
by
the
petitioner,
appeared
in
the
courier
journal,
and
this
article
dealt
with
the
use
and
sale
of
marijuana
in
the
state
capitol
buildings
in
frankfort,
kentucky
and
the
environs
of
the
capitol
buildings
in
frankfort.
immediately
following
the
publication
of
this
article,
the
petitioner
was
subpoenaed
to
appear
before
a
grand
jury
in
franklin
county,
kentucky
and
the
subpoena
stated,
"to
testify
in
the
matter
of
violation
of
statutes
concerning
the
use
and
sale
of
drugs."
a
motion
to
quash
this
subpoena
was
made
on
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
grounds,
and
the
trial
court,
the
respondent
meigs
entered
an
order,
which
in
effect
overruled
the
contentions
we
made
directing
the
petitioner
to
appear
before
the
franklin
county
grand
jury.
at
that
time,
we
contended
not
only
that
testimony
with
relation
to
the
article
was
privileged
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment,
but
we
contended
that
the
mere
appearance
of
the
petitioner
under
this
subpoena
was
protected
against
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.
the
trial
court
having
overruled
us
on
this
position,
we
appealed
for
relief
to
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals,
which
had
our
petition
for
reconsideration
in
the
first
case
still
pending
before
it.
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
refused
us
the
relief,
which
we
had
requested,
entered
a
modified
opinion
in
the
first
case
upon
our
petition
for
reconsideration,
which
in
essence
modified
the
first
opinion
by
adding
a
footnote
contending
that
we
had
abandoned
our
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
claims
in
the
argument
in
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals.
a
position
which
i
might
say,
i
think
was
a
distortion
of
the
record
and
which
has
not
been
urged
in
this
court
in
the
briefs.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
yes
sir.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
yes
sir,
judge
meigs
entered
a
four
paragraph
protective
order
which
in
the
first
three
paragraphs
is
modeled
very
much
like
the
order
judge
zepilli
(ph)
entered
in
the
caldwell
case,
but
then
he
took
it
all
back
in
the
fourth
paragraph
because
he
said,
"not
withstanding
anything,"
in
the
first
three
paragraphs.
petitioner
shall
not
be
protected
from
disclosing
anything
concerning
any
crime
here
as
observed.
and
of
course,
the
whole
news
article
was
about
the
possession
and
sale
of
marijuana
which
is
a
misdemeanor
under
kentucky
law.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
yes,
sir.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
there
were
two
articles.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
yes
sir
and
the
other
appears
on
pages
30
to
42
of
the
appendix.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
both
were
published
in
the
louisville
courier
journal.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
yes,
sir.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
local,
yes
sir.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
yes
sir,
the
courier
journal
is
a
daily
or
general
circulation
throughout
the
state.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
following
upon
judge
meigs’
action
as
i
stated
the
court
of
appeals,
entered
its
modified
opinion
in
the
hayes
case,
and
denied
us
the
relief
we
asked
in
the
meigs
case.
it
subsequently
followed
this
with
an
opinion
in
the
meigs
case
which
is
at
present
unreported,
but
is
set
out
in
the
appendix
at
page
54,
and
in
substance
in
that
opinion,
they
rejected
our
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
arguments.
they
took
the
position
that
a
newsman
occupies
no
position
different
from
any
other
citizen
in
the
community,
and
they
specifically
rejected
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
caldwell
decision.
we
asked
for
stays
and
engaged
in
various
procedural
moves
to
hold
up
action
pending
application
for
certiorari
to
this
court,
this
was
denied.
and
upon
application,
mr.
justice
stewart
granted
a
temporary
injunction
staying
any
further
compulsion
or
contempt
proceedings
against
the
petitioner
pending
application
for
certiorari,
and
on
may
3
1971,
certiorari
was
granted
and
we
are
here.
with
the
indulgence
of
the
court,
i
would
first
like
to
state
the
issue
and
the
proposition
we
urge,
and
then
to
develop
our
arguments
and
support
of
that
proposition.
in
the
sense
that
these
cases
seek
relief
for
a
newsman
from
compulsory
testimony
under
certain
circumstances,
they
are
cases
of
first
impression
in
this
court.
they
are
here
as
was
the
caldwell
case
yesterday,
and
the
pappas
case
which
follows
us,
because
of
a
distressingly
increasing
practice
of
the
entire
criminal
administration
apparatus,
grand
juries,
prosecutors,
investigators,
to
attempt
to
make
the
news
media
into
an
appendage
of
that
apparatus
by
compelling
newsmen
to
give
testimony
relating
to
that
confidential
sources
and
information.
doctrinally
however,
these
are
not
cases
of
first
impression.
we
are
asking
here
only
for
that
historical
protection
against
governmental
interference
with
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights,
which
this
court
has
always
provided.
while
the
factual
setting
may
be
novo,
these
cases
seek
nothing
more
than
the
application
here
of
these
court’s
salutary
and
off
repeated
requirement.
that
there
is
imposed
upon
the
government
the
burden
of
demonstrating
a
compelling
and
overriding
need,
and
the
lack
of
alternatives
less
destructive
of
first
amendment
rights
before
government
interference
with
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights
will
be
countenance.
the
rule
that
we
urge
upon
the
court,
is
that
the
freedom
of
the
press
guaranteed
by
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
encompasses
not
only
publication,
but
all
meaningful
preconditions
to
publication,
not
the
least
of
which
is
the
ability
to
gather
or
obtain
information.
to
ensure
these
rights,
we
believe
that
it
is
necessary
for
this
court
to
declare
that
the
first
amendment
protects
a
newsman
from
being
compelled
to
enter
a
closed
proceeding
and
from
being
compelled
to
disclose
confidential
information
obtained
by
him
as
a
newsman,
unless
there
has
been
a
prior
demonstration
by
the
government
in
an
open
hearing
of
a
compelling
and
overriding
need
for
the
disclosure.
now,
while
we
do
not
believe
that
the
test
of
compelling
and
overriding
need
can
be
or
should
be
precisely
defined.
we
suggest
that
as
a
minimum,
the
following
consideration
should
be
weighed,
but
none
alone
should
be
treated
as
controlling.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
yes,
sir.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
yes,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
firstly,
let
me
comment
that
the
definition
of
a
newsman
as
such
while
we
will
offer
one,
is
should
not
be
a
problem
as
the
court
will
recall
in
the
whole
line
of
litigation
starting
with
sullivan
against
the
new
york
times,
we
had
to,
and
the
court
had
to
deal
with
the
definition
of
the
public
official.
and
we
moved
from
public
official
in
sullivan
with
the
footnote
that
the
court
does
not
here
define
how
far
this
reaches
in
the
government
structure
to
public
person,
to
a
person
of
prominence,
and
so
forth.
unless,
of
course,
this
is
what
the
courts
are
peculiarly
and
aptly
fitted
to
do.
and
we
submit
that
the
same
thing
with
the
newsman,
but
as
a
starting
point,
we
would
define
a
newsman
as
any
person
who
want
to
continue
as
basis,
is
engaged
in
the
process
of
gathering
information
and
preparing
such
information
for
the
dissemination
to
the
public.
that
is
a
very
simplistic
definition,
but
we
think
it
would
be
a
good
starting
place
within
the
traditional
approach
of
this
court.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
yes,
sir.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
i
would
not
--
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
yes
but,
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
would
not
agree
that
logically
carried
to
its
conclusion,
everyone
under
the
exercise
of
the
grant
of
free
speech
would
have
the
right
to
refuse
to
testify.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
well,
specifically
we
are
talking
about
press,
which
is
also
mentioned
in
the
first
amendment.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
in
the
records,
in
these
cases
demonstrate,
at
least
we
believe,
and
we
would
urge
upon
the
court,
that
the
compulsion
of
testimony
by
newsmen
would
have
an
inhibiting
effect
upon
the
ability
of
the
press
to
fulfill
its
function.
we
know
of
no
such
record
with
respect
to
compelling
individuals
to
come
before
grand
jury
and
testify
generally
in
so
far
as
free
speech.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
the
right
of
free
speech
including
--
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
no
sir!
i
do
not
think
the
right
of
free
speech
has
ever
been
interpreted
by
this
court
as
including
the
right
to
keep
silent
when
called
before
--
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
that
is
correct,
and
our
position
is
that
the
record
here
amply
demonstrates
that
it
is
a
necessary
concomitant
of
the
first
amendment
free
press
right
to
protect
the
newsman
that
the
laws
in
not
compelling
testimony
is
so
little
in
the
balancing
process
that
we
urge
that
the
right
be
protected,
if
i
follow
your
hypothesis.
if
it
at
some
future
time
a
light
demonstration
is
made,
that
grand
jury
testimony
by
individuals
has
a
chilling
effect
upon
the
exercise
of
free
speech,
and
--
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
well,
i
don’t
know
whether
it
would
or
not,
all
i
can
--
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
no,
because
i
do
not
believe
that
in
the
context
of
speech,
there
is
the
assurance,
that
when
confidences
are
given,
that
they
will
not
be
disclosed
as
part
of
the
compulsory
process
of
a
grand
jury.
but
what
we
are
urging
here
is
that
it
is
necessary
to
the
functioning
of
the
press,
and
it
has
been
a
part
of
the
process
of
the
press,
that
such
confidences
be
given,
and
those
confidences
are
the
condition
upon
which
information
is
available
to
the
public.
i
do
not
see
the
same
demonstration
in
the
speech
area.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
yes
it
does,
and
the
court
has
made
a
different
balancing
considerations,
and
different
applications
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
we
would
make
that
distinction,
mr.
justice
white,
but
of
course
in
that
case
it
would
be
meaningless
anyway
because
the
information
could
be
obtained
by
others
which
would
end
the
quest,
but
doctrinally,
we
make
the
distinction
because
we
are
talking
about
freedom
of
the
press
and
the
necessity
to
provide
the
information
for
the
public.
it
is
not
the
newsman
that
we
emphasize.
the
newsman
is
the
mechanism,
but
we
are
emphasizing
the
necessity
for
seeing
to
it
that
the
flow
of
information
to
the
public
is
maintained.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
my
response
to
that
would
have
to
be
that
the
framers
of
the
constitution
did
not
put
up
an
amendment
in
for
them,
and
there
is
a
first
amendment
dealing
with
the
press.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
well,
in
so
far
as
the
exercise
of
free
speech
is
concerned,
i
merely
be
repeating
my
self
in
the
remarks
i
made
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stewart.
we
draw
a
distinction
there
on
the
demonstrations
and
the
record,
and
on
the
objectives
that
we
are
urging
here.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
our
formulation
would
call
for
the
kind
of
investigation
in
an
open
hearing
that
is
made
by
courts
today
when
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
is
asserted.
that
is
if
prima
facie
the
trial
court
determines
that
the
plea
is
being
made
and
sincerity
in
good
faith,
it
is
to
be
honored.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
well,
this
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
goes
to
the
heart
of
what
we’re
talking
about
and
why
this
is
so
important.
there
are
dissident
elements
in
the
society
today
which
for
the
first
time
historically,
the
news
media
are
really
dealing
with.
traditionally,
the
news
media
and
historically
have
reported
what
is
going
on
in
the
general
community,
the
orthodox
community,
but
more
and
more
through
investigative
reporting,
they
are
dealing
with
the
unorthodox,
the
rebellious,
the
youth,
the
drug
culture,
the
hippies,
the
dissidents.
now,
these
people
do
want
to
get
there
positions
across
to
the
community
at
large
and
it
is
important
for
the
community
at
large
to
understand
their
positions.
there’s
great
controversy
in
this
country
today
about
the
question
of
legalization
of
marijuana.
it’s
important
for
the
public,
in
determining
that
question
to
understand
the
attitude
of
those
who
use.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
well,
i
think
the
important
thing
is
for
the
public
to
have
the
right
to
know,
and
if
having
the
right
to
know
the
sources
will
destroy
the
ability
to
obtain
the
information,
then
it
leads
us
no
place.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
well,
that’s
part
of
it
and
i
suppose
in
that
quantum,
the
public
will
also
weigh
the
fact
that
these
people
wanted
to
remain
unidentified,
but
obviously
if
you
are
going
to
print
news
about
what
is
presently
and
illegal
activity,
you
are
not
going
to
get
information
voluntarily
from
those
who
are
participating
in
such
activity
if
it
is
going
to
immediately
lead
to
their
arrest
and
prosecution.
it
is
a
question
of
cutting
off
the
information
at
the
very
start.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
not
under
the
definition
which
i
offered
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
believe
of
what
a
newsman
is,
because
--
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
it
is
a
difficult
distinction,
but
when
i
think,
that
has
to
be
made.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
in
the
application
with
the
definition
that
we
make,
that
would
be
the
case,
but
again
mr.
chief
justice
i
must
emphasize
that
we
are
not
talking
about
reporters
who
are
reporters
as
against
other
individuals.
we
are
talking
about
the
flow
of
information
protected
by
the
first
amendment
for
the
benefit
of
the
general
public.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
as
an
abstract
composition
it
would
and
i
might
agree
in
a
particular
case,
but
here
the
first
amendment
talks
about
the
press,
it
doesn’t
--
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
yes
sir,
but
we
have
to
arrive
at
a
definition
and
for
definitional
purposes
we
have
defined
the
press
as
one
who
want
to
continue
his
basis
does
this,
not
a
volunteer.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
well,
i
would
concede
that
pamphleteer
in
such
may,
under
the
formulation
we
make
be
included
in
a
particular
case,
then
they
have
to
be
some
weighing
and
balancing,
but
as
a
starting
point,
we
believe
that
in
the
tradition
of
this
court
going
one
step
at
a
time
that
you
start
with
a
definition
of
the
press
along
the
lines
that
i
have
suggested,
and
that
we
move
with
experience
from
there.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
well,
i
am
not
familiar
with
to
what
extent
they
would
print,
but
i
would
suppose
not.
i
would
suppose
not.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
yes,
sir.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
we
are
not
prepared
to
urge
that
upon
the
court,
because
again
while
that
maybe
a
freedom
of
speech
problem,
it
is
not
a
freedom
of
the
press
problem.
we
are
talking
specifically
about
press.
there
are
many
elements
in
the
community
that
are
engaged
in
the
acquisition
of
knowledge,
and
the
dissemination
of
knowledge,
but
they
are
not
constitutionally
protected
and
constitutionally
dealt
with,
and
so
we
don’t
reach
that
problem.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
well,
mr.
justice
marshall
i
think
that
is
the
same
answer
i
have
just
given
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
that
does
not
in
our
judgment
fit
in
to
the
constitutional
framework.
yes.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
not
in
that
sense,
no.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
yes,
sir.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
well
--
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
at
this
time
the
questioning
by
the
members
of
the
court
started,
i
was
at
the
point
of
stating
to
the
court
the
standards
that
we
would
apply,
and
the
third
standard
that
i
have
to
offer,
if
i
may,
it
will
respond
to
your
question.
we
have
said
that
there
must
be
a
test
of
compelling
and
overwhelming
need
demonstrated
by
the
government
for
the
information,
and
i
was
starting
to
say
that
while
we
do
not
believe
it
could
be
or
should
be
precisely
defined
that
is
a
minimum
the
following
three
considerations,
none
alone
of
which
we
would
consider
be
controlling
should
be
applied.
first,
that
there
is
probable
cause
that
the
newsman
has
specific
information
relative
to
a
specific
permissible
inquiry.
second,
that
there
are
no
alternative
means
less
destructive
of
first
amendment
rights
by
which
to
obtain
the
information;
and
third,
and
this
is
in
answer
to
your
question
mr.
justice
marshall,
that
the
newsman’s
appearance
and
testimony
is
necessary
to
prevent
direct
immediate
and
irreparable
perspective
damage
to
national
security,
human
life,
or
liberty.
and
in
terms
of
the
third
consideration,
we
would
say
a
court
couldn’t
weigh
and
compel
the
testimony.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
yes,
it
would
in
terms
of
my
third
--
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
national
security.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
national
security,
human
life,
or
liberty.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
yes
sir,
human
life
or
liberty.
so
in
the
case
you
posed,
which
is
in
substance
i
would
suppose
the
knox
case
in
wisconsin.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
well,
i
think
--
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
i
think
there
are
distinctions
in
this
court
has
recognized
that
distinctions
can
be
drawn
as
between
crimes.
mr.
justice
jackson,
speaking
for
this
court
in
the
brandon
case
in
1958
dealing
with
the
fourth
amendment,
pointed
out
that
while
the
court
would
not
countenance
a
widespread
net
and
search
of
all
vehicles
leaving
a
community
in
the
case
of
some
misdemeanor,
if
there
was
a
kidnapping
and
such
a
dragnet
was
necessary
to
save
the
life
of
a
child,
such
a
search
would
be
countenance
under
the
fourth
amendment.
so
a
distinction
among
crimes
is
not
such
a
novel
idea
for
this
court.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
not
at
the
moment
sir.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
i
have
known
of
no
specific
application,
but
i
suggest
that
it
is
not
unreasonable
argument
at
all.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
subpoena
the
reporter?
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
in
under
our
balance
and
test,
that
would
be
possible,
yes.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
i
would
say
that
would
come
in
under
the
balancing
act,
and
it
might
be
permissible
for
the
court
using
the
standards
we
have
applied.
if
he
felt
that
the
definition
is
of
perspective
damage
to
human
life
or
liberty.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
that
is
correct.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
i
thank
you
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
have
misunderstood
mr.
justice
rehnquist’s
question.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
i
deal
solely
with
confidentiality,
yes
sir.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
information.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
yes
sir.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
our
argument
is
that
the
judgment
must
be
left
to
the
newsman
as
to
what
he
will
publish
or
not
publish.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
he
might
withhold
as
a
matter
of
news
judgment,
that
some
information
that
he’s
acquired
as
a
basis
for
publishing
of
it,
yes,
in
response
to
your
question.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
yes,
sir.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
he
could
exercise
that
judgment.
let
me
if
i
may
indicate
something
in
the
court,
in
the
main,
the
questions
that
have
been
posed
to
me
have
dealt
with
problems
of
definition,
of
problems
singling
out
the
newsman,
of
problems
of
the
various
kinds
of
crimes
and
such
that
might
or
might
not
be
disclosed
to
the
public.
if
i
may,
let
me
suggest
the
paradox
that
we’re
dealing
with
here.
in
our
cases
for
example,
the
petitioners’
cases
if
this
court
was
to
affirm
the
holdings
below,
then
that
effect
would
be
to
require
the
petitioner
to
go
into
the
grand
juries
in
kentucky,
and
disclose
the
identity
of
two
individuals
in
one
case,
and
3,
4,
5,
6
individuals
in
another
case
who
then
might
be
successfully
prosecuted
for
the
misdemeanors
involved,
but
the
end
product
would
be,
that’s
the
end
of
it.
from
that
point
on,
this
court
having
announced
that
there
is
no
protection,
no
further
information
will
be
forthcoming
to
reporters
on
a
confidential
basis.
no
reporters
will
be
available
to
aid
the
prosecution
by
giving
testimony
before
grand
juries,
or
any
place
else,
because
they’re
not
going
to
have
the
information.
elements
in
the
community
that
might
have
provided
information,
including
government
officials
at
all
levels
will
no
longer
provide
such
information
to
reporters
--
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
i
don’t
disagree
with
that.
it
may
have
elements
of
felony
on
it.
the
sources
of
information
would
be
withheld.
reporters
who
have
information
who
have
information
on
a
confidential
basis
will
exercise
prior
restraint
in
the
form
of
self
censorship,
by
not
printing
that
information
for
fear
that
they
will
be
called
before
grand
jury,
and
the
end
result
is
that
a
court’s
ruling
here
upholding
the
decision
below,
will
complete
the
circle
and
completely
dry
up
information
and
accomplish
nothing
other
than
the
prosecution
of
the
few
individuals
involved
in
these
cases.
on
the
other
hand
--
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
well,
i
am
saying
that
up
to
now,
they
have
been
able
to
get
that
information,
but
once
this
court
declares
that
there
is
no
first
amendment
right
to
protect
that,
they
are
not
going
to
get
the
information,
that’s
what
i’m
saying.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
oh!
no,
sir.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
this
case
demonstrates
--
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
no,
sir.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
i
don’t
believe
it
takes
us
back,
because
as
a
practical
matter,
the
very
fact
that
this
issue
has
not
gotten
here
before,
i
think
is
demonstration
of
the
fact
that
prosecutors
have
not
pressed
newsmen,
up
until
recent
years,
that
accommodations
have
been
worked
out
to
protect
confidential
sources
and
such.
but
in
recent
years,
what
i
said
was,
there
has
been
a
distressingly
increasing
spate
of
activity
by
prosecutors
in
such
to
compel
information
from
newsmen
and
the
attorney
general’s
recent
guidelines
is
indicative
of
the
changed
situation,
and
the
recognition
of
the
fact
that
there
has
been
this
developing
situation.
i
am
about
at
the
end
of
my
time,
so
i
would
just
say
in
closing,
that
what
we
are
talking
about
is
a
first
amendment
situation.
we
think
that
the
failure
to
ensure
to
newsmen
a
first
amendment
right
here
would
result
to
self-censorship,
prior
restraint,
the
drying
up
of
sources
of
information
would
result
in
a
total
loss
to
the
general
public
of
the
kinds
and
scope,
and
extent
of
information
which
the
first
amendment
was
designed
to
achieve.
i
think
the
records
demonstrate
very
clearly
the
chilling
effect
upon
the
newsman’s
ability
to
operate
that
these
subpoenas,
and
compelling
testimony
induces.
the
inevitable
conclusion
that
we
believe
is
the
case,
is
that
the
newsman
is
entitled
under
the
first
amendment
to
refuse
to
disclose
confidential
material,
and
to
appear
in
a
closed
proceeding
under
compulsion,
unless
there
has
been
a
prior
demonstration
in
an
open
hearing
by
the
government
of
a
compelling
and
overriding
need
for
compulsory
disclosure.
and
we
have
suggested
three
criteria
to
be
applied
in
determining
whether
or
not
there
is
such
a
compelling
and
overriding
need,
none
of
which
we
suggest
is
to
be
controlling,
but
we
strongly
urge
upon
the
court
that
in
the
historic
line
of
cases,
which
have
preserved
and
enhanced
first
amendment
rights
in
the
process
of
bringing
about
that
robust
and
wide
open
debate,
which
this
court
has
noted,
in
preserving
an
untrammeled
press,
that
the
necessity
for
declaring
these
first
amendment
rights
is
immediate
and
urgent,
and
that
it
comes
at
very
slight
cost
to
the
prosecutorial
apparatus
to
the
criminal
administration
apparatus.
whereas,
the
reverse
was
noted
yesterday
by
mr.
amsterdam
in
his
argument,
every
newsman
interviewed
in
the
particular
survey
has
said
that
it
would
be
a
disaster
for
the
newsman
to
operate
in
the
face
of
a
declaration
by
this
court,
that
confidential
sources
could
not
be
protected.
thank
you.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
mr.
justice
powell,
i
don’t
think
in-camera
proceedings
would
be
acceptable,
because
the
basis
that
the
moment
the
newsman
goes
behind
the
closed
door,
that
the
suspicions
of
the
kind
that
were
referred
to
in
the
caldwell
case
yesterday
are
generated
and
so
we
think
it
necessitates
an
open
hearing.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
trial
judge.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
i
agree
with
that,
but
the
traditional
practice,
for
example
as
the
record
shows
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
was
called
before
the
trial
judge.
the
two
questions
were
read
to
the
trial
judge
and
the
petitioner
was
directed
by
the
trial
judge
to
answer
those
questions.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
well,
he
said
that
by
saying
that,
"i
don’t
agree
with
you,
that
there’s
a
first
or
fourteenth
amendment
privilege."
i
would
say
this
is
not
the
time
nor
place,
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
i
would
say
there
is
a
great
deal
of
myth
prevalent
in
--
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
yes
sir,
and
in
my
20
some
arguments
of
experience
in
the
courts
of
kentucky,
with
that
in
any
way
testing
any
aspersions
on
my
friend
mr.
schroering
here,
the
myth
does
not
fit
the
operations
of
grand
juries
in
kentucky.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
we
make
some
distinction
with
reference
to
trials,
but
in
essence,
the
way
we
formulated
the
situation
the
same
balancing
test
would
be
made.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
yes,
sir.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
well,
i
think
i’ve
said
he
would
not
have
to
appear
in
a
close
proceeding.
he
has
to
appear
in
the
open
proceeding.
there’s
no
need.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
he
would
then
assert
his
privilege
not
to
respond
to
questions
relating
to
confidential
information,
but
certainly
would
have
to
appear.
it’s
the
vice
of
the
close
proceeding
that
we
objected
to.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
thank
you.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
mr.
chief
justice,
thank
you.
i
would
briefly
point
out,
mr.
justice
rehnquist;
you
asked
the
question
about
the
abandonment
of
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
claims
in
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals,
and
mr.
schroering.
i
believe
in
error
stated
that
the
contention
was
that
in
oral
argument,
i
had
abandoned
that
claim.
that’s
not
what
the
record
discloses.
the
record
discloses
that
the
court
of
appeals
claimed
that
in
a
supplemental
memorandum
which
i
filed
with
them,
i
had
abandoned
that
claim
by
a
statement
which
i
made
that
there
is
no
question
here
concerning
the
first
amendment
concerning
the
issue
of
privilege
itself,
we
have
a
statute.
we
dealt
with
this
preposition
in
our
replied
brief
on
the
application
for
writ
of
certiorari
that
was
taken
out
of
context.
it
was
in
response
to
an
argument
based
upon
professor
wigmore’s
writings
on
privileges.
but
in
any
event,
even
if
there
was
a
technical
abandonment
in
the
meigs
case,
they
specifically
rejected
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
grounds.
as
this
court
has
noted
it
would
be
a
fruitless
exercise
to
send
us
back,
have
the
petitioner
make
his
assertion,
be
held
in
contempt
and
we’d
be
right
here
because
we
know
what
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
would
do.
now,
the
solicitor
general
has
referred
in
his
argument
to
the
attorney
general’s
guidelines
in
response
to
your
question
from
mr.
justice
douglas.
i
would
point
out
that
first
of
all,
as
mr.
justice
douglas
recognized,
and
as
i
think
the
court
was
recognized
because
the
solicitor
general
states
it
in
his
brief.
this
is
a
very
delicate
area,
recognized
by
the
federal
government,
but
then
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief
says
that
the
attorney
general’s
guidelines
do
not
create
any
litigable
rights.
so
what
we
have
is,
in
the
federal
area,
a
statement
of
policy,
but
at
the
same
time
the
solicitor
general
tells
us
that
if
they
decide
not
to
follow
it,
that’s
their
judgment
and
no
rights,
are
conferred.
we’re
talking
about
first
amendment
rights
and
as
mr.
reynolds
indicated,
we
are
talking
about
the
penumbra
of
rights,
and
we
suggest
that
under
the
penumbra,
this
right
is
necessary
of
declaration.
now
in
this
entire
argument
this
morning,
and
to
some
extent
yesterday,
there
seem
to
be
some
implicit
assumption
that
compulsory
testimonies
an
absolute
absent
of
fifth
amendment
privilege.
well,
that’s
just
not
the
case.
to
begin
with,
we
have
on
the
government
side,
the
asserted
right
of
the
government
not
provided
any
place
in
the
constitution.
not
to
disclose
the
identity
of
informants
in
criminal
proceedings
and
that’s
been
protected
by
judicial
decisions.
we
have
--
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
well,
and
i
think
if
necessarily
so,
but
its
still
is
established
and
it’s
a
right
that
they
urge
--
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
we
have
the
appearance
issue
on
the
threshold,
but
--
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
yes,
sir.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
yes
sir,
but
--
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
[laughter]yes
sir.
i
went
to
yale
too,
and
maybe
they
didn’t
teach
us
that.[laughter]
i
would
--
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
we
agree.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
yes
sir.
then
i
would
pass
finally
to
this
200-year
argument
which
i
eluded
to
in
my
argument
earlier,
and
that
is
we
don’t
know
what
the
situation
might
have
been,
had
the
court
declared
this
first
amendment
penumbra
right
that
we
urge,
somewhat
earlier.
we
don’t
know
to
what
extent
the
press
has
been
denied
information,
but
we
do
know
in
the
record
in
the
caldwell
case,
in
the
branzburg
affidavit,
which
is
part
of
the
record
in
our
case,
the
present
effect
of
a
denial
of
this
privilege.
we
have
already
seen
situations,
and
the
caldwell
judge
himself,
as
i
think
has
been
noted
in
some
of
the
supplemental
briefs
and
proceedings
following
upon
caldwell
applying
the
same
guidelines,
has
compelled
the
disclosure
of
testimonies.
so
the
guidelines
themselves
were
too
narrow
to
extend
any
significant
protection.
further,
i
would
point
out
that
we’re
dealing
with
a
new
breed
of
newsman
today.
with
the
advent
of
television,
and
the
on
the
spot
coverage
that
the
television
newscaster
provides,
more
and
more
our
daily
newspapers
are
going
into
in-depth
reporting,
investigative
reporting.
and
this
is
an
entirely
different
situation,
and
does
deal
with
the
sensitive
groups
where
information
is
required.
i
would
just
conclude
an
urge
upon
you
that
the
penumbra
area
of
the
first
amendment
requires
the
declaration
here
the
rights
we
urge.
thank
you.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
my
answer
would
have
to
be,
mr.
chief
justice
that
i
could
not
isolate
that
situation
and
in
the
balancing
act
that
i
suggest
ought
to
be
fulfilled.
the
gain
to
the
community
in
that
one
instance
as
weighed
against
the
situation
that
we
posed,
that
denial
of
the
privilege
would
lead
to
the
overall
effect
of
denying
the
entire
community,
the
flow
of
information
that
i
would
sacrifice,
in
this
case,
the
gain
of
that
information
about
that
specific
situation.
i
think,
if
we
don’t
do
that,
then
we’re
cutting
off
the
flow
of
information
to
serve
this
one
immediate
purpose.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
don’t
have
the
specific
answer
to
that.
but
there
is
cited
in
our
brief
a
survey
by
guest
and
stanzler
which
appears
at
page
16
and
18
of
our
brief.
and
that
my
understanding
is
that
the
courier
journal
was
one
of
the
newspapers
that
participated
in
the
analysis.
and
i
believe
the
analysis
indicated
a
staggering
percentage
40-50%
of
stories
in
the
newspaper
survey
were
based
upon
confidential
information.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
no,
sir.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
these
cases
are
witnessing
of
crime,
that’s
the
hard
case.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
appear
here
on
behalf
of
the
petition
of
paul
branzburg,
a
professional
journalist
employed
by
the
courier
journal,
a
daily
newspaper
published
in
louisville,
kentucky.
the
petitioner
seeks
reversal
on
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
ground
of
two
cases
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
kentucky,
in
the
first
of
these,
involving
the
respondent
hayes,
a
judge
in
the
trial
court
in
jefferson
county,
kentucky.
following
upon
publication
in
the
courier
journal
of
an
article
authored
by
the
petitioner,
which
described
the
manufacture
of
hashish
by
two
individuals
in
louisville,
kentucky,
in
which
in
the
body
of
the
article
contained
the
statement,
that
a
promise
had
been
given
by
the
petitioner
that
the
identity
of
the
two
individuals
would
be
maintained
confidential,
and
would
not
be
disclosed.
the
petitioner
was
subpoenaed
before
a
grand
jury,
sitting
in
jefferson
county,
kentucky,
and
was
asked
by
that
asked
by
that
grand
jury
two
questions
relating
to
the
identity
of
the
person
that
he
had
described
in
a
newspaper
article.
one
of
the
questions
asked
him
specifically,
"on
november
12
or
13,
1969,
who
was
the
person
or
persons
you
observed
in
possession
of
marijuana
about
which
you
wrote
an
article
in
the
courier
journal
on
november
15,
1969?"
the
second
question
was,
"on
november
13,
1969,
who
was
the
person
or
persons
you
observed
compounding
marijuana
producing
same
to
a
compound
known
as
hashish?"
this
appears
in
our
appendix
at
page
6.
the
petitioner
refused
to
answer
these
questions,
and
was
brought
before
the
predecessor
in
office
of
the
respondent
hayes,
a
trial
judge
by
the
name
of
pound,
and
upon
the
questions
being
read
to
the
judge,
the
petitioner
was
directed
to
answer
the
questions.
at
that
time
we
appeared
in
behalf
of
the
petitioner
and
asserted
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
grounds
under
the
concept
of
freedom
of
the
press
for
the
petitioner’s
refusal
to
answer
the
questions.
we
also
asserted
the
provisions
of
a
kentucky
shield
statute,
krs,
kentucky
revised
statutes
421.100,
which
is
phrased
in
language
that
protects
a
newsman
from
revealing
the
source
of
any
information
published
by
him.
the
trial
court
rejected
the
contentions
made
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner,
and
various
motions
for
writs
of
prohibition
and
for
stays
were
made
in
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals.
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
granted
a
temporary
stay
prohibiting
the
respondent’s
predecessor
in
office
from
proceeding
with
contempt
action
against
the
petitioner,
until
such
time
as
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
had
occasion
to
pass
on
the
merits
of
the
case.
the
case
was
subsequently
briefed
and
argued
to
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
on
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
grounds,
in
addition
to
the
provisions
of
the
kentucky
shield
statute.
in
november
of
1970,
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
delivered
an
opinion,
in
which
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
kentucky
shield
statue
did
not
protect
the
petitioner.
it
held
that
the
shield’s
statute
was
restricted
solely
to
informants,
information
and
protected
the
identity
of
informants,
but
where
the
reporter,
or
newsman
observed
at
firsthand
individuals
engaged
in
a
particular
activity
which
might
cause
to
the
crime
or
any
activity,
he
was
not
privileged
to
protect
the
identity
of
the
individuals
themselves,
a
position
which
seems
to
us
to
put
a
premium
on
second
hand
reporting
and
second
hand
sources
somewhat
incongruously.
shortly
after
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
opinion
was
delivered,
a
petition
for
reconsideration
was
filed
in
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals,
calling
to
that
court’s
attention.
the
fact
that
they
had
made
no
comment
upon
our
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
arguments,
and
citing
to
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
caldwell
against
the
united
states.
the
appeal
of
which
was
argued
before
this
court
yesterday.
while
that
was
pending
before
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals,
another
article
authored
by
the
petitioner,
appeared
in
the
courier
journal,
and
this
article
dealt
with
the
use
and
sale
of
marijuana
in
the
state
capitol
buildings
in
frankfort,
kentucky
and
the
environs
of
the
capitol
buildings
in
frankfort.
immediately
following
the
publication
of
this
article,
the
petitioner
was
subpoenaed
to
appear
before
a
grand
jury
in
franklin
county,
kentucky
and
the
subpoena
stated,
"to
testify
in
the
matter
of
violation
of
statutes
concerning
the
use
and
sale
of
drugs."
a
motion
to
quash
this
subpoena
was
made
on
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
grounds,
and
the
trial
court,
the
respondent
meigs
entered
an
order,
which
in
effect
overruled
the
contentions
we
made
directing
the
petitioner
to
appear
before
the
franklin
county
grand
jury.
at
that
time,
we
contended
not
only
that
testimony
with
relation
to
the
article
was
privileged
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment,
but
we
contended
that
the
mere
appearance
of
the
petitioner
under
this
subpoena
was
protected
against
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.
the
trial
court
having
overruled
us
on
this
position,
we
appealed
for
relief
to
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals,
which
had
our
petition
for
reconsideration
in
the
first
case
still
pending
before
it.
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
refused
us
the
relief,
which
we
had
requested,
entered
a
modified
opinion
in
the
first
case
upon
our
petition
for
reconsideration,
which
in
essence
modified
the
first
opinion
by
adding
a
footnote
contending
that
we
had
abandoned
our
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
claims
in
the
argument
in
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals.
a
position
which
i
might
say,
i
think
was
a
distortion
of
the
record
and
which
has
not
been
urged
in
this
court
in
the
briefs.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
yes
sir.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
yes
sir,
judge
meigs
entered
a
four
paragraph
protective
order
which
in
the
first
three
paragraphs
is
modeled
very
much
like
the
order
judge
zepilli
(ph)
entered
in
the
caldwell
case,
but
then
he
took
it
all
back
in
the
fourth
paragraph
because
he
said,
"not
withstanding
anything,"
in
the
first
three
paragraphs.
petitioner
shall
not
be
protected
from
disclosing
anything
concerning
any
crime
here
as
observed.
and
of
course,
the
whole
news
article
was
about
the
possession
and
sale
of
marijuana
which
is
a
misdemeanor
under
kentucky
law.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
yes,
sir.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
there
were
two
articles.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
yes
sir
and
the
other
appears
on
pages
30
to
42
of
the
appendix.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
both
were
published
in
the
louisville
courier
journal.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
yes,
sir.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
local,
yes
sir.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
yes
sir,
the
courier
journal
is
a
daily
or
general
circulation
throughout
the
state.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
following
upon
judge
meigs’
action
as
i
stated
the
court
of
appeals,
entered
its
modified
opinion
in
the
hayes
case,
and
denied
us
the
relief
we
asked
in
the
meigs
case.
it
subsequently
followed
this
with
an
opinion
in
the
meigs
case
which
is
at
present
unreported,
but
is
set
out
in
the
appendix
at
page
54,
and
in
substance
in
that
opinion,
they
rejected
our
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
arguments.
they
took
the
position
that
a
newsman
occupies
no
position
different
from
any
other
citizen
in
the
community,
and
they
specifically
rejected
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
caldwell
decision.
we
asked
for
stays
and
engaged
in
various
procedural
moves
to
hold
up
action
pending
application
for
certiorari
to
this
court,
this
was
denied.
and
upon
application,
mr.
justice
stewart
granted
a
temporary
injunction
staying
any
further
compulsion
or
contempt
proceedings
against
the
petitioner
pending
application
for
certiorari,
and
on
may
3
1971,
certiorari
was
granted
and
we
are
here.
with
the
indulgence
of
the
court,
i
would
first
like
to
state
the
issue
and
the
proposition
we
urge,
and
then
to
develop
our
arguments
and
support
of
that
proposition.
in
the
sense
that
these
cases
seek
relief
for
a
newsman
from
compulsory
testimony
under
certain
circumstances,
they
are
cases
of
first
impression
in
this
court.
they
are
here
as
was
the
caldwell
case
yesterday,
and
the
pappas
case
which
follows
us,
because
of
a
distressingly
increasing
practice
of
the
entire
criminal
administration
apparatus,
grand
juries,
prosecutors,
investigators,
to
attempt
to
make
the
news
media
into
an
appendage
of
that
apparatus
by
compelling
newsmen
to
give
testimony
relating
to
that
confidential
sources
and
information.
doctrinally
however,
these
are
not
cases
of
first
impression.
we
are
asking
here
only
for
that
historical
protection
against
governmental
interference
with
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights,
which
this
court
has
always
provided.
while
the
factual
setting
may
be
novo,
these
cases
seek
nothing
more
than
the
application
here
of
these
court’s
salutary
and
off
repeated
requirement.
that
there
is
imposed
upon
the
government
the
burden
of
demonstrating
a
compelling
and
overriding
need,
and
the
lack
of
alternatives
less
destructive
of
first
amendment
rights
before
government
interference
with
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights
will
be
countenance.
the
rule
that
we
urge
upon
the
court,
is
that
the
freedom
of
the
press
guaranteed
by
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
encompasses
not
only
publication,
but
all
meaningful
preconditions
to
publication,
not
the
least
of
which
is
the
ability
to
gather
or
obtain
information.
to
ensure
these
rights,
we
believe
that
it
is
necessary
for
this
court
to
declare
that
the
first
amendment
protects
a
newsman
from
being
compelled
to
enter
a
closed
proceeding
and
from
being
compelled
to
disclose
confidential
information
obtained
by
him
as
a
newsman,
unless
there
has
been
a
prior
demonstration
by
the
government
in
an
open
hearing
of
a
compelling
and
overriding
need
for
the
disclosure.
now,
while
we
do
not
believe
that
the
test
of
compelling
and
overriding
need
can
be
or
should
be
precisely
defined.
we
suggest
that
as
a
minimum,
the
following
consideration
should
be
weighed,
but
none
alone
should
be
treated
as
controlling.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
yes,
sir.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
yes,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
firstly,
let
me
comment
that
the
definition
of
a
newsman
as
such
while
we
will
offer
one,
is
should
not
be
a
problem
as
the
court
will
recall
in
the
whole
line
of
litigation
starting
with
sullivan
against
the
new
york
times,
we
had
to,
and
the
court
had
to
deal
with
the
definition
of
the
public
official.
and
we
moved
from
public
official
in
sullivan
with
the
footnote
that
the
court
does
not
here
define
how
far
this
reaches
in
the
government
structure
to
public
person,
to
a
person
of
prominence,
and
so
forth.
unless,
of
course,
this
is
what
the
courts
are
peculiarly
and
aptly
fitted
to
do.
and
we
submit
that
the
same
thing
with
the
newsman,
but
as
a
starting
point,
we
would
define
a
newsman
as
any
person
who
want
to
continue
as
basis,
is
engaged
in
the
process
of
gathering
information
and
preparing
such
information
for
the
dissemination
to
the
public.
that
is
a
very
simplistic
definition,
but
we
think
it
would
be
a
good
starting
place
within
the
traditional
approach
of
this
court.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
yes,
sir.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
i
would
not
--
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
yes
but,
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
would
not
agree
that
logically
carried
to
its
conclusion,
everyone
under
the
exercise
of
the
grant
of
free
speech
would
have
the
right
to
refuse
to
testify.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
well,
specifically
we
are
talking
about
press,
which
is
also
mentioned
in
the
first
amendment.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
in
the
records,
in
these
cases
demonstrate,
at
least
we
believe,
and
we
would
urge
upon
the
court,
that
the
compulsion
of
testimony
by
newsmen
would
have
an
inhibiting
effect
upon
the
ability
of
the
press
to
fulfill
its
function.
we
know
of
no
such
record
with
respect
to
compelling
individuals
to
come
before
grand
jury
and
testify
generally
in
so
far
as
free
speech.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
the
right
of
free
speech
including
--
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
no
sir!
i
do
not
think
the
right
of
free
speech
has
ever
been
interpreted
by
this
court
as
including
the
right
to
keep
silent
when
called
before
--
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
that
is
correct,
and
our
position
is
that
the
record
here
amply
demonstrates
that
it
is
a
necessary
concomitant
of
the
first
amendment
free
press
right
to
protect
the
newsman
that
the
laws
in
not
compelling
testimony
is
so
little
in
the
balancing
process
that
we
urge
that
the
right
be
protected,
if
i
follow
your
hypothesis.
if
it
at
some
future
time
a
light
demonstration
is
made,
that
grand
jury
testimony
by
individuals
has
a
chilling
effect
upon
the
exercise
of
free
speech,
and
--
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
well,
i
don’t
know
whether
it
would
or
not,
all
i
can
--
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
no,
because
i
do
not
believe
that
in
the
context
of
speech,
there
is
the
assurance,
that
when
confidences
are
given,
that
they
will
not
be
disclosed
as
part
of
the
compulsory
process
of
a
grand
jury.
but
what
we
are
urging
here
is
that
it
is
necessary
to
the
functioning
of
the
press,
and
it
has
been
a
part
of
the
process
of
the
press,
that
such
confidences
be
given,
and
those
confidences
are
the
condition
upon
which
information
is
available
to
the
public.
i
do
not
see
the
same
demonstration
in
the
speech
area.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
yes
it
does,
and
the
court
has
made
a
different
balancing
considerations,
and
different
applications
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
we
would
make
that
distinction,
mr.
justice
white,
but
of
course
in
that
case
it
would
be
meaningless
anyway
because
the
information
could
be
obtained
by
others
which
would
end
the
quest,
but
doctrinally,
we
make
the
distinction
because
we
are
talking
about
freedom
of
the
press
and
the
necessity
to
provide
the
information
for
the
public.
it
is
not
the
newsman
that
we
emphasize.
the
newsman
is
the
mechanism,
but
we
are
emphasizing
the
necessity
for
seeing
to
it
that
the
flow
of
information
to
the
public
is
maintained.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
my
response
to
that
would
have
to
be
that
the
framers
of
the
constitution
did
not
put
up
an
amendment
in
for
them,
and
there
is
a
first
amendment
dealing
with
the
press.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
well,
in
so
far
as
the
exercise
of
free
speech
is
concerned,
i
merely
be
repeating
my
self
in
the
remarks
i
made
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stewart.
we
draw
a
distinction
there
on
the
demonstrations
and
the
record,
and
on
the
objectives
that
we
are
urging
here.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
our
formulation
would
call
for
the
kind
of
investigation
in
an
open
hearing
that
is
made
by
courts
today
when
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
is
asserted.
that
is
if
prima
facie
the
trial
court
determines
that
the
plea
is
being
made
and
sincerity
in
good
faith,
it
is
to
be
honored.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
well,
this
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
goes
to
the
heart
of
what
we’re
talking
about
and
why
this
is
so
important.
there
are
dissident
elements
in
the
society
today
which
for
the
first
time
historically,
the
news
media
are
really
dealing
with.
traditionally,
the
news
media
and
historically
have
reported
what
is
going
on
in
the
general
community,
the
orthodox
community,
but
more
and
more
through
investigative
reporting,
they
are
dealing
with
the
unorthodox,
the
rebellious,
the
youth,
the
drug
culture,
the
hippies,
the
dissidents.
now,
these
people
do
want
to
get
there
positions
across
to
the
community
at
large
and
it
is
important
for
the
community
at
large
to
understand
their
positions.
there’s
great
controversy
in
this
country
today
about
the
question
of
legalization
of
marijuana.
it’s
important
for
the
public,
in
determining
that
question
to
understand
the
attitude
of
those
who
use.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
well,
i
think
the
important
thing
is
for
the
public
to
have
the
right
to
know,
and
if
having
the
right
to
know
the
sources
will
destroy
the
ability
to
obtain
the
information,
then
it
leads
us
no
place.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
well,
that’s
part
of
it
and
i
suppose
in
that
quantum,
the
public
will
also
weigh
the
fact
that
these
people
wanted
to
remain
unidentified,
but
obviously
if
you
are
going
to
print
news
about
what
is
presently
and
illegal
activity,
you
are
not
going
to
get
information
voluntarily
from
those
who
are
participating
in
such
activity
if
it
is
going
to
immediately
lead
to
their
arrest
and
prosecution.
it
is
a
question
of
cutting
off
the
information
at
the
very
start.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
not
under
the
definition
which
i
offered
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
believe
of
what
a
newsman
is,
because
--
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
it
is
a
difficult
distinction,
but
when
i
think,
that
has
to
be
made.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
in
the
application
with
the
definition
that
we
make,
that
would
be
the
case,
but
again
mr.
chief
justice
i
must
emphasize
that
we
are
not
talking
about
reporters
who
are
reporters
as
against
other
individuals.
we
are
talking
about
the
flow
of
information
protected
by
the
first
amendment
for
the
benefit
of
the
general
public.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
as
an
abstract
composition
it
would
and
i
might
agree
in
a
particular
case,
but
here
the
first
amendment
talks
about
the
press,
it
doesn’t
--
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
yes
sir,
but
we
have
to
arrive
at
a
definition
and
for
definitional
purposes
we
have
defined
the
press
as
one
who
want
to
continue
his
basis
does
this,
not
a
volunteer.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
well,
i
would
concede
that
pamphleteer
in
such
may,
under
the
formulation
we
make
be
included
in
a
particular
case,
then
they
have
to
be
some
weighing
and
balancing,
but
as
a
starting
point,
we
believe
that
in
the
tradition
of
this
court
going
one
step
at
a
time
that
you
start
with
a
definition
of
the
press
along
the
lines
that
i
have
suggested,
and
that
we
move
with
experience
from
there.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
well,
i
am
not
familiar
with
to
what
extent
they
would
print,
but
i
would
suppose
not.
i
would
suppose
not.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
yes,
sir.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
we
are
not
prepared
to
urge
that
upon
the
court,
because
again
while
that
maybe
a
freedom
of
speech
problem,
it
is
not
a
freedom
of
the
press
problem.
we
are
talking
specifically
about
press.
there
are
many
elements
in
the
community
that
are
engaged
in
the
acquisition
of
knowledge,
and
the
dissemination
of
knowledge,
but
they
are
not
constitutionally
protected
and
constitutionally
dealt
with,
and
so
we
don’t
reach
that
problem.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
well,
mr.
justice
marshall
i
think
that
is
the
same
answer
i
have
just
given
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
that
does
not
in
our
judgment
fit
in
to
the
constitutional
framework.
yes.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
not
in
that
sense,
no.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
yes,
sir.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
well
--
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
at
this
time
the
questioning
by
the
members
of
the
court
started,
i
was
at
the
point
of
stating
to
the
court
the
standards
that
we
would
apply,
and
the
third
standard
that
i
have
to
offer,
if
i
may,
it
will
respond
to
your
question.
we
have
said
that
there
must
be
a
test
of
compelling
and
overwhelming
need
demonstrated
by
the
government
for
the
information,
and
i
was
starting
to
say
that
while
we
do
not
believe
it
could
be
or
should
be
precisely
defined
that
is
a
minimum
the
following
three
considerations,
none
alone
of
which
we
would
consider
be
controlling
should
be
applied.
first,
that
there
is
probable
cause
that
the
newsman
has
specific
information
relative
to
a
specific
permissible
inquiry.
second,
that
there
are
no
alternative
means
less
destructive
of
first
amendment
rights
by
which
to
obtain
the
information;
and
third,
and
this
is
in
answer
to
your
question
mr.
justice
marshall,
that
the
newsman’s
appearance
and
testimony
is
necessary
to
prevent
direct
immediate
and
irreparable
perspective
damage
to
national
security,
human
life,
or
liberty.
and
in
terms
of
the
third
consideration,
we
would
say
a
court
couldn’t
weigh
and
compel
the
testimony.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
yes,
it
would
in
terms
of
my
third
--
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
national
security.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
national
security,
human
life,
or
liberty.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
yes
sir,
human
life
or
liberty.
so
in
the
case
you
posed,
which
is
in
substance
i
would
suppose
the
knox
case
in
wisconsin.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
well,
i
think
--
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
i
think
there
are
distinctions
in
this
court
has
recognized
that
distinctions
can
be
drawn
as
between
crimes.
mr.
justice
jackson,
speaking
for
this
court
in
the
brandon
case
in
1958
dealing
with
the
fourth
amendment,
pointed
out
that
while
the
court
would
not
countenance
a
widespread
net
and
search
of
all
vehicles
leaving
a
community
in
the
case
of
some
misdemeanor,
if
there
was
a
kidnapping
and
such
a
dragnet
was
necessary
to
save
the
life
of
a
child,
such
a
search
would
be
countenance
under
the
fourth
amendment.
so
a
distinction
among
crimes
is
not
such
a
novel
idea
for
this
court.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
not
at
the
moment
sir.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
i
have
known
of
no
specific
application,
but
i
suggest
that
it
is
not
unreasonable
argument
at
all.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
subpoena
the
reporter?
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
in
under
our
balance
and
test,
that
would
be
possible,
yes.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
i
would
say
that
would
come
in
under
the
balancing
act,
and
it
might
be
permissible
for
the
court
using
the
standards
we
have
applied.
if
he
felt
that
the
definition
is
of
perspective
damage
to
human
life
or
liberty.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
that
is
correct.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
i
thank
you
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
have
misunderstood
mr.
justice
rehnquist’s
question.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
i
deal
solely
with
confidentiality,
yes
sir.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
information.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
yes
sir.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
our
argument
is
that
the
judgment
must
be
left
to
the
newsman
as
to
what
he
will
publish
or
not
publish.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
he
might
withhold
as
a
matter
of
news
judgment,
that
some
information
that
he’s
acquired
as
a
basis
for
publishing
of
it,
yes,
in
response
to
your
question.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
yes,
sir.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
he
could
exercise
that
judgment.
let
me
if
i
may
indicate
something
in
the
court,
in
the
main,
the
questions
that
have
been
posed
to
me
have
dealt
with
problems
of
definition,
of
problems
singling
out
the
newsman,
of
problems
of
the
various
kinds
of
crimes
and
such
that
might
or
might
not
be
disclosed
to
the
public.
if
i
may,
let
me
suggest
the
paradox
that
we’re
dealing
with
here.
in
our
cases
for
example,
the
petitioners’
cases
if
this
court
was
to
affirm
the
holdings
below,
then
that
effect
would
be
to
require
the
petitioner
to
go
into
the
grand
juries
in
kentucky,
and
disclose
the
identity
of
two
individuals
in
one
case,
and
3,
4,
5,
6
individuals
in
another
case
who
then
might
be
successfully
prosecuted
for
the
misdemeanors
involved,
but
the
end
product
would
be,
that’s
the
end
of
it.
from
that
point
on,
this
court
having
announced
that
there
is
no
protection,
no
further
information
will
be
forthcoming
to
reporters
on
a
confidential
basis.
no
reporters
will
be
available
to
aid
the
prosecution
by
giving
testimony
before
grand
juries,
or
any
place
else,
because
they’re
not
going
to
have
the
information.
elements
in
the
community
that
might
have
provided
information,
including
government
officials
at
all
levels
will
no
longer
provide
such
information
to
reporters
--
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
i
don’t
disagree
with
that.
it
may
have
elements
of
felony
on
it.
the
sources
of
information
would
be
withheld.
reporters
who
have
information
who
have
information
on
a
confidential
basis
will
exercise
prior
restraint
in
the
form
of
self
censorship,
by
not
printing
that
information
for
fear
that
they
will
be
called
before
grand
jury,
and
the
end
result
is
that
a
court’s
ruling
here
upholding
the
decision
below,
will
complete
the
circle
and
completely
dry
up
information
and
accomplish
nothing
other
than
the
prosecution
of
the
few
individuals
involved
in
these
cases.
on
the
other
hand
--
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
well,
i
am
saying
that
up
to
now,
they
have
been
able
to
get
that
information,
but
once
this
court
declares
that
there
is
no
first
amendment
right
to
protect
that,
they
are
not
going
to
get
the
information,
that’s
what
i’m
saying.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
oh!
no,
sir.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
this
case
demonstrates
--
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
no,
sir.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
i
don’t
believe
it
takes
us
back,
because
as
a
practical
matter,
the
very
fact
that
this
issue
has
not
gotten
here
before,
i
think
is
demonstration
of
the
fact
that
prosecutors
have
not
pressed
newsmen,
up
until
recent
years,
that
accommodations
have
been
worked
out
to
protect
confidential
sources
and
such.
but
in
recent
years,
what
i
said
was,
there
has
been
a
distressingly
increasing
spate
of
activity
by
prosecutors
in
such
to
compel
information
from
newsmen
and
the
attorney
general’s
recent
guidelines
is
indicative
of
the
changed
situation,
and
the
recognition
of
the
fact
that
there
has
been
this
developing
situation.
i
am
about
at
the
end
of
my
time,
so
i
would
just
say
in
closing,
that
what
we
are
talking
about
is
a
first
amendment
situation.
we
think
that
the
failure
to
ensure
to
newsmen
a
first
amendment
right
here
would
result
to
self-censorship,
prior
restraint,
the
drying
up
of
sources
of
information
would
result
in
a
total
loss
to
the
general
public
of
the
kinds
and
scope,
and
extent
of
information
which
the
first
amendment
was
designed
to
achieve.
i
think
the
records
demonstrate
very
clearly
the
chilling
effect
upon
the
newsman’s
ability
to
operate
that
these
subpoenas,
and
compelling
testimony
induces.
the
inevitable
conclusion
that
we
believe
is
the
case,
is
that
the
newsman
is
entitled
under
the
first
amendment
to
refuse
to
disclose
confidential
material,
and
to
appear
in
a
closed
proceeding
under
compulsion,
unless
there
has
been
a
prior
demonstration
in
an
open
hearing
by
the
government
of
a
compelling
and
overriding
need
for
compulsory
disclosure.
and
we
have
suggested
three
criteria
to
be
applied
in
determining
whether
or
not
there
is
such
a
compelling
and
overriding
need,
none
of
which
we
suggest
is
to
be
controlling,
but
we
strongly
urge
upon
the
court
that
in
the
historic
line
of
cases,
which
have
preserved
and
enhanced
first
amendment
rights
in
the
process
of
bringing
about
that
robust
and
wide
open
debate,
which
this
court
has
noted,
in
preserving
an
untrammeled
press,
that
the
necessity
for
declaring
these
first
amendment
rights
is
immediate
and
urgent,
and
that
it
comes
at
very
slight
cost
to
the
prosecutorial
apparatus
to
the
criminal
administration
apparatus.
whereas,
the
reverse
was
noted
yesterday
by
mr.
amsterdam
in
his
argument,
every
newsman
interviewed
in
the
particular
survey
has
said
that
it
would
be
a
disaster
for
the
newsman
to
operate
in
the
face
of
a
declaration
by
this
court,
that
confidential
sources
could
not
be
protected.
thank
you.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
mr.
justice
powell,
i
don’t
think
in-camera
proceedings
would
be
acceptable,
because
the
basis
that
the
moment
the
newsman
goes
behind
the
closed
door,
that
the
suspicions
of
the
kind
that
were
referred
to
in
the
caldwell
case
yesterday
are
generated
and
so
we
think
it
necessitates
an
open
hearing.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
trial
judge.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
i
agree
with
that,
but
the
traditional
practice,
for
example
as
the
record
shows
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
was
called
before
the
trial
judge.
the
two
questions
were
read
to
the
trial
judge
and
the
petitioner
was
directed
by
the
trial
judge
to
answer
those
questions.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
well,
he
said
that
by
saying
that,
"i
don’t
agree
with
you,
that
there’s
a
first
or
fourteenth
amendment
privilege."
i
would
say
this
is
not
the
time
nor
place,
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
i
would
say
there
is
a
great
deal
of
myth
prevalent
in
--
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
yes
sir,
and
in
my
20
some
arguments
of
experience
in
the
courts
of
kentucky,
with
that
in
any
way
testing
any
aspersions
on
my
friend
mr.
schroering
here,
the
myth
does
not
fit
the
operations
of
grand
juries
in
kentucky.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
we
make
some
distinction
with
reference
to
trials,
but
in
essence,
the
way
we
formulated
the
situation
the
same
balancing
test
would
be
made.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
yes,
sir.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
well,
i
think
i’ve
said
he
would
not
have
to
appear
in
a
close
proceeding.
he
has
to
appear
in
the
open
proceeding.
there’s
no
need.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
he
would
then
assert
his
privilege
not
to
respond
to
questions
relating
to
confidential
information,
but
certainly
would
have
to
appear.
it’s
the
vice
of
the
close
proceeding
that
we
objected
to.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
thank
you.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
mr.
chief
justice,
thank
you.
i
would
briefly
point
out,
mr.
justice
rehnquist;
you
asked
the
question
about
the
abandonment
of
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
claims
in
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals,
and
mr.
schroering.
i
believe
in
error
stated
that
the
contention
was
that
in
oral
argument,
i
had
abandoned
that
claim.
that’s
not
what
the
record
discloses.
the
record
discloses
that
the
court
of
appeals
claimed
that
in
a
supplemental
memorandum
which
i
filed
with
them,
i
had
abandoned
that
claim
by
a
statement
which
i
made
that
there
is
no
question
here
concerning
the
first
amendment
concerning
the
issue
of
privilege
itself,
we
have
a
statute.
we
dealt
with
this
preposition
in
our
replied
brief
on
the
application
for
writ
of
certiorari
that
was
taken
out
of
context.
it
was
in
response
to
an
argument
based
upon
professor
wigmore’s
writings
on
privileges.
but
in
any
event,
even
if
there
was
a
technical
abandonment
in
the
meigs
case,
they
specifically
rejected
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
grounds.
as
this
court
has
noted
it
would
be
a
fruitless
exercise
to
send
us
back,
have
the
petitioner
make
his
assertion,
be
held
in
contempt
and
we’d
be
right
here
because
we
know
what
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
would
do.
now,
the
solicitor
general
has
referred
in
his
argument
to
the
attorney
general’s
guidelines
in
response
to
your
question
from
mr.
justice
douglas.
i
would
point
out
that
first
of
all,
as
mr.
justice
douglas
recognized,
and
as
i
think
the
court
was
recognized
because
the
solicitor
general
states
it
in
his
brief.
this
is
a
very
delicate
area,
recognized
by
the
federal
government,
but
then
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief
says
that
the
attorney
general’s
guidelines
do
not
create
any
litigable
rights.
so
what
we
have
is,
in
the
federal
area,
a
statement
of
policy,
but
at
the
same
time
the
solicitor
general
tells
us
that
if
they
decide
not
to
follow
it,
that’s
their
judgment
and
no
rights,
are
conferred.
we’re
talking
about
first
amendment
rights
and
as
mr.
reynolds
indicated,
we
are
talking
about
the
penumbra
of
rights,
and
we
suggest
that
under
the
penumbra,
this
right
is
necessary
of
declaration.
now
in
this
entire
argument
this
morning,
and
to
some
extent
yesterday,
there
seem
to
be
some
implicit
assumption
that
compulsory
testimonies
an
absolute
absent
of
fifth
amendment
privilege.
well,
that’s
just
not
the
case.
to
begin
with,
we
have
on
the
government
side,
the
asserted
right
of
the
government
not
provided
any
place
in
the
constitution.
not
to
disclose
the
identity
of
informants
in
criminal
proceedings
and
that’s
been
protected
by
judicial
decisions.
we
have
--
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
well,
and
i
think
if
necessarily
so,
but
its
still
is
established
and
it’s
a
right
that
they
urge
--
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
we
have
the
appearance
issue
on
the
threshold,
but
--
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
yes,
sir.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
yes
sir,
but
--
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
[laughter]yes
sir.
i
went
to
yale
too,
and
maybe
they
didn’t
teach
us
that.[laughter]
i
would
--
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
we
agree.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
yes
sir.
then
i
would
pass
finally
to
this
200-year
argument
which
i
eluded
to
in
my
argument
earlier,
and
that
is
we
don’t
know
what
the
situation
might
have
been,
had
the
court
declared
this
first
amendment
penumbra
right
that
we
urge,
somewhat
earlier.
we
don’t
know
to
what
extent
the
press
has
been
denied
information,
but
we
do
know
in
the
record
in
the
caldwell
case,
in
the
branzburg
affidavit,
which
is
part
of
the
record
in
our
case,
the
present
effect
of
a
denial
of
this
privilege.
we
have
already
seen
situations,
and
the
caldwell
judge
himself,
as
i
think
has
been
noted
in
some
of
the
supplemental
briefs
and
proceedings
following
upon
caldwell
applying
the
same
guidelines,
has
compelled
the
disclosure
of
testimonies.
so
the
guidelines
themselves
were
too
narrow
to
extend
any
significant
protection.
further,
i
would
point
out
that
we’re
dealing
with
a
new
breed
of
newsman
today.
with
the
advent
of
television,
and
the
on
the
spot
coverage
that
the
television
newscaster
provides,
more
and
more
our
daily
newspapers
are
going
into
in-depth
reporting,
investigative
reporting.
and
this
is
an
entirely
different
situation,
and
does
deal
with
the
sensitive
groups
where
information
is
required.
i
would
just
conclude
an
urge
upon
you
that
the
penumbra
area
of
the
first
amendment
requires
the
declaration
here
the
rights
we
urge.
thank
you.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
my
answer
would
have
to
be,
mr.
chief
justice
that
i
could
not
isolate
that
situation
and
in
the
balancing
act
that
i
suggest
ought
to
be
fulfilled.
the
gain
to
the
community
in
that
one
instance
as
weighed
against
the
situation
that
we
posed,
that
denial
of
the
privilege
would
lead
to
the
overall
effect
of
denying
the
entire
community,
the
flow
of
information
that
i
would
sacrifice,
in
this
case,
the
gain
of
that
information
about
that
specific
situation.
i
think,
if
we
don’t
do
that,
then
we’re
cutting
off
the
flow
of
information
to
serve
this
one
immediate
purpose.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
don’t
have
the
specific
answer
to
that.
but
there
is
cited
in
our
brief
a
survey
by
guest
and
stanzler
which
appears
at
page
16
and
18
of
our
brief.
and
that
my
understanding
is
that
the
courier
journal
was
one
of
the
newspapers
that
participated
in
the
analysis.
and
i
believe
the
analysis
indicated
a
staggering
percentage
40-50%
of
stories
in
the
newspaper
survey
were
based
upon
confidential
information.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
no,
sir.
mr.
edgar
a.
zingman
these
cases
are
witnessing
of
crime,
that’s
the
hard
case.
