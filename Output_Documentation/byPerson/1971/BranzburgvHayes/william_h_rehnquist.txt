justice
william

rehnquist
judge
meigs
did
do
more
for
your
client
than
judge
pound
had,
did
he
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
at
your
position
and
the
judge
miggs
order
was
for
practical
purpose
as
the
same
thing
as
judge
pound.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
zingman.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
following
up
on
the
same
line
of
question
with
which
you
have
already
been
barraged.
take
the
class
of
people
who
speak
more
or
less
formally
as
an
occupation
of
whom
i
would
think
perhaps
college
professors,
lecturers.
now,
justice
stewart
suggested
that,
and
i
think
that
he
is
quite
right
that
the
freedom
of
speech
is
every
bit
as
much
protected
as
freedom
of
the
press.
and
here
you
have
a
class
of
people
that
are
more
or
less
regularly
exercising
the
freedom
of
speech,
and
not
casually
exercise
it.
wouldn’t
your
concept
of
the
privilege
at
least
have
to
extend
to
this
type
of
person?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
your
test,
mr.
zingman,
supposing
that
the
reporter
had
witnessed
a
murder,
but
there
was
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
man
was
in
the
business
of
murdering
people,
it
was
a
one
time
offense.
could
the
grand
jury
subpoena
him
to
testify?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
i
thought
it
was
danger
to
national
security,
liberty;
you
would
regard
the
prosecution
of
an
already
completed
offense
as
a
way
of
in
affect,
averting
that
sort
of
danger?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
the
palm
case,
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
suggested
that
what
your
client
witnessed
was
a
felony,
rather
than
a
misdemeanor,
do
you
disagree
with
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
schroering,
even
in
the
pound
case,
certainly
the
petitioners
here,
and
their
application
to
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
raised
the
constitutional
question,
did
they
not?
as
i
read
the
appendix
at
page
10.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it
is
a
contention
of
abandonment
of
an
oral
argument,
although
the
claim
was
made
in
the
written
application
to
the
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
state
didn’t
appeal
from
that
portions
of
judge
meigs
order
that
were
adverse
to
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
zingman,
let
me
ask
you
one
more
question,
following
up
that
response
if
i
may?
your
talking
about
the
cutting
off
of
an
entire
flow
of
information,
do
you
have
any
idea
how
many
stories
the
courier
journal
runs
in
a
year,
in
which
the
reporter’s
account
indicates
that
he
witnessed
the
commission
of
a
crime?
justice
william
