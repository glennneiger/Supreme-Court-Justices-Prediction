justice

what
about
to
research
and
write
on
a
book
on
criminology?
justice
thurgood
marshall
author
of
the
book
doesn’t
uncover?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
in
this
case,
your
man
witnessed
a
crime,
correct?
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
that
instead
of
making
hashish,
they
were
making
a
bomb
to
blow
up
the
capitol
in
frankfort,
would
the
privilege
still
apply?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
just
want
to
know
how
far
you’d
go
with
this
crime.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
they
were
making
a
bomb
to
blow
up
john
doe,
of
ordinary
citizen,
it
wouldn’t
be
covered,
would
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
you
said
they’d
be
some
of
national
importance
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
but
killing
john
doe,
isn’t?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
or
liberty?
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
old
problem
is,
crime
is
a
crime.
are
they
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you’re
going
to
draw
a
line
among
crime.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
got
another
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don’t
think
so.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
same
state
of
kentucky,
through
its
judiciary
said
that
statute
just
under
(inaudible).
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what
do
we
have
before
us,
that
statute
or
the
judgment
in
this
case?
we
have
the
judgment
in
this
case
interpreted
its
own
statute.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
it
said
that
it
doesn’t
apply.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
how
do
you
make
a
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
nonetheless,
i
thought,
in
the
last
decision
in
your
court
ruled
specifically
on
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment,
and
you
said
it
didn’t
apply.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that’s
the
one
that’s
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that
was
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
wouldn’t
be
employing
them,
because
you
don’t
pay
them.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
this
judgment
has
affirmed
than
every
place
in
the
country
want
a
story
of
peace
and
oppressed,
which
shows
confidential
information
concerning
a
crime.
wouldn’t
it
automatically
follow
that
the
grand
jury
would
subpoena
that
reporter?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
would
you
say
they’re
so
great,
how
could
they
be
doing
the
job
if
they
didn’t?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
then,
wouldn’t
it
be
too
that
once
they
publish
the
story,
they
volunteer
as
a
witness?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
wouldn’t
they
be
subpoenaed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
i
think,
if
i
understand
this
case
correctly,
he
did
raise
the
privilege,
and
it
was
denied.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
then
if
i
would
to
say
further,
that
if
we
affirm
this
case,
every
time
a
reporter
publishes
a
story
of
this
type,
he
would
be
subpoenaed
before
the
grand
jury,
will
make
his
claim
of
privilege
and
it
would
be
denied.

i
