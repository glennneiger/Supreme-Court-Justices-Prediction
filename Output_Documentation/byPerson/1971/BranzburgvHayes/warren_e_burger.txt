shouldn’t
the
public
have
a
right
to
know
the
sources
of
that
information?
chief

isn’t
the

going
to
make
its
evaluation
of
the

depending
on
the
credibility
of

chief

e.

let
me
ask
you
a
hypothetical
question
to
pursue
the
point
of
both
justice
stewart
and
justice
white
embarked
on.
suppose
in
a
particular
community,
not
only
the
law
enforcement
authorities
were
apathetic,
but
also
the
press
was
apathetic
and
some
public
spirited
citizens
decided
to
conduct
their
own
investigation,
and
they
went
around
and
did
just
what
your
investigative
reporter
did.
and
then
used
the
time
honored
method
of
writing
a
letter
to
the
editor,
to
do
again,
just
what
your
investigative
reporter
did.
is
he
protected?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
justice
stewart
suggested
that
it’s
a
difficult
distinction
to
make.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but,
the
reporter
is
protected
and
the
citizen
who
writes
the
letter
to
the
editor
is
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
doesn’t
that
standard
precisely
fit
my
hypothetical
public-spirited
citizen
who
is
trying
to
get
the
flow
of
information
that
neither
the
law
enforcement
authorities
nor
the
local
press
is
delivering
to
the
public.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
man
is
using
the
press,
isn’t
he,
vicariously?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
historically
in
this
country,
and
in
other
countries,
particularly
our
own
beginning
200
years
ago,
wasn’t
the
letter
to
the
editor
a
great
means
of
use
by
essayist
and
pamphleteers
who
communicated
to
the
public
in
much
the
way
the
columnists
do
today,
with
any
less
for
madison
or
jefferson,
or
any
of
these
men,
any
less
exercising
the
freedom
of
press,
because
they
did
not
get
paid
for
writing
their
letters
to
the
editor?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
your
definition,
you
would
not
automatically
include
all
the
authors
of
the
federalist
papers,
would
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.

do
you
think
the
court
has
ever
adopted
mr.

jackson’s
view
of
that
bifurcation
of
the

chief

warren
e.

mr.

we’ve
helped
you
consume
your
time,

it
is
used
up
that
we’ll
allow
you
a
full
five
minutes
for
rebuttal.
chief

we’ll
adjust
the

time
accordingly.

thank
you
mr.

chief

mr.

chief

e.

aren’t
the
attorney
general’s
guidelines
manifestation
of
that
very
thing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
i
suppose
too,
those
guidelines
have
a
further
effect
with
93
branch
offices
as
it
were,
93
united
states
attorneys
around
the
country
in
such
an
important,
and
sensitive
area
as
this
opt
to
have
a
uniform
treatment
in
federal
system.
i
suppose
that’s
the
function
of
those
guidelines,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
allow
you
five
minutes
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
that’s
been
considerably
eroded,
has
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
just
put
a
hypothetical
question
to
you
now
on
the
court’s
time
counsel.
suppose
the
prosecutor
upon
reading
this
story
or
the
foreman
of
the
grand
jury,
if
there
was
a
grand
jury
then
sitting
as
i
gather
there
is
in
the
larger
cities
of
kentucky,
concluded
that
this
was
one
of
two
things.
either
the
story
was
true
and
the
local
police
department
was
not
alert
enough,
or
the
story
was
a
hoax,
and
a
fabrication,
and
a
fraud,
and
the
pictures
were
flagellant
with
actors
and
not
real
people,
and
that
the
powder
was
baking
soda
and
not
hashish.
and
so,
as
foreman
of
the
grand
jury,
i
must
make
it
the
foreman
of
the
grand
jury,
he
said
he
wanted
to
find
out
which
was
true.
now,
would
you
think
there
is
an
important
public
interest
to
be
served
in
finding
out
which
of
these
two
things
is
true,
namely
is
the
police
department
falling
down
or
is
it
in
league
with
these
people
on
the
one
hand,
or
is
this
just
a
fabricated
news
story
completely
made
up
out
of
the
whole
cloth?
chief
