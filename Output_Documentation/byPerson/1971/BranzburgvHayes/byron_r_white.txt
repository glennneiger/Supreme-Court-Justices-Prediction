justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let
us
suppose
this
reporter
has
been
accompanied
by
a
member
of
the
state
legislature
who
was
simply
interested
in
informing
himself
in
connection
with
perhaps
the
revision
of
the
state
criminal
code.
he
was
also
accompanied
by
an
interested
parent
and
he
was
also
accompanied
by
the
head
of
the
criminal
law
revision
commission,
and
they
both
saw
the
same
thing,
and
you
would
say
the
reporter
would
be
privileged
and
none
of
the
others
would?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
interested
parent
and
the
head
of
the
criminal
law
revision
commission
says
that,
we
just
cannot
get
the
information
to
allow
us
to
conduct
our
business,
run
our
families,
and
to
run
this
committee,
if
we
are
not
allowed
to
respect
confidences.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
are
covered
as
mr.
justice
stewart
said
by
the
free
speech
provision.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
might
ask
you
also,
do
you
say
that
the
newsman’s
claim
of
privilege
must
automatically
be
respected
once
he
claims
it.
is
there
any
investigation
or
any
proof
required
as
to
whether
he
received
the
information
in
confidence,
or
must
do
the
search
and
just
fix
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
think
in
this
case,
this
is
a
practical
matter,
a
reporter
goes
and
sees
what
he
says
and
reports
it.
as
a
practical
matter,
why
would
the
people
that
he
saw
running
this
hashish
laboratory,
permit
him
to
publish
the
fact
that
there
was
this
laboratory
operating
but
say,
please
don’t
publish
are
names?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
that
you
would’ve
searched
this
privilege
with
respect
to
the
name
and
the
source,
but
also
with
respect
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--to
information.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
let’s
assume
a
reporter
gets
items
a
to
z,
and
he
promises
not
to
disclose
l
to
z,
but
he
may
disclose
a
to
l,
and
he
does.
concededly
however,
l
to
z
are
very
newsworthy
items
that
if
he
would
free
to
publish
them,
and
he
says,
"i
must
have
this
privilege
in
order
that
i
could
publish
a
to
l,
but
i
must
privileged
to
withhold
this
other
very
newsworthy
information."
so
your
argument
is
you
must
permit
him
to
suppress
certain
newsworthy
items
in
order
to
disclose
some
other,
is
that
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
may
suppress
newsworthy
information
in
order
to,
publish
some
of
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
also,
he’s
got
the
judgment
as
to
when
to
publish?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
even
if
he
says,
"well
these
items,
the
l
to
z,
i
am
going
to
publish
sometime,
but
not
now."
justice
byron
r.
white
aren’t
you
saying
at
that
point,
perhaps
i
don’t
follow
you,
that
this
is
precisely
the
situation
that
is
prevailed
until
recently
when
your
newsman
were
able
to
get
into
some
of
these
circles
and
uncover
news
that
here
before
was
not
available?
justice
byron
r.
white
awhile
ago,
i
thought
you
said
that
up
to
now
they
hadn’t
been
able
to
get
this
information?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that’s
why
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
it’s
only
recently
that
newsman
has
been
able
to
get
into
this
inner
circle.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
i
suggest
that
your
parade
of
horribles
and
then
he
takes
us
back.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you
just
one
question?
do
you
claim
the

privilege
for

justice
byron

white
would
you
say
the

privileges
would
be
available

he
would
