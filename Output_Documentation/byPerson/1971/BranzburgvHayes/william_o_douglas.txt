justice
william
o.
douglas
is
your
only
brief
this
little
3,
4-page
brief?
justice
william
o.
douglas
do
you
think
that
you
say
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution,
apart
from
the
privilege
of
self-incrimination
that
protects
the
witness?
justice
william
o.
douglas
suppose
a
man
is
on
the
stand,
or
let
the
state
of
committee
and
asked
him
if
he
believes
in
jesus
christ
or
god,
or
what
his
religion
is,
do
you
think
that
is
subject
to
examination
by
government
group?
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
particular
part
in
religion
that
do
you
believe
in
socialist?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
mean,
everything
goes
in
these
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
state
can
compel
everybody
to
do
anything?
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
you
tell
the
priest,
what
you
tell
your
pastor,
what
you
tell
your
wife,
what
you
tell
your
doctor.
all
those
things
could
be
squeezed
out
of
in
there?
justice
william
o.
douglas
no,
i
am
just
amazed
on
this
little
3-page.
you
treat
it
as
almost
a
frivolous
question.
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
don’t
cite
any
cases
in
your
brief.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
see
it.
justice
william
o.
douglas
does
the
prosecutor
or
the
police
in
kentucky
use
newspapermen
as
agents,
or
runners,
or
investigators?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
our
question
implies,
there
is
no
privilege
in
this
case.
there’d
be
no
privilege
in
any
trial
i
suppose.
petit
jury
has
a
great
(inaudible)
under
our
system.
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
the
law
maybe,
have
you
ever
been
to
a
palestinian
country?
you’ve
been
to
russia?
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
oppressed
or
kind
of
oppressed
that
you
have
under
a
regiment
society?
justice
william
o.
douglas
then
you
made
every
reporter
a
runner
for
the
government
in
every
case?
justice
william
o.
douglas
this
doesn’t
stop
at
grand
jury.
these
rules
of
their
exceptions
have
a
tendency
to
run
the
full
limit
of
their
logical
standards
--
or
rather
the
petty
jury
apply
to
administrative
agency
apply.
i
would
think
every
aspect
is
passed
to
the
government.
justice
william
o.
douglas
if
he
can
be
required
to
testify
with
this,
i
don’t
see
why
it
couldn’t
be
required
to
testify
at
the
sec
or
the
federal
trade.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
didn’t
think
we
were
talking
about
a
witness
to
a
felony.
this
is
a
case
as
i
understand
it,
for
incompetence
this
man
has
given
in
commission.
justice
william
o.
douglas
he’s
not
walking
down
the
street
and
sees
a
bank
being
held
up,
that’s
not
this
case,
is
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
he
got
confidential
information.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
being
a
member
of
the
communist
party
has
been
a
crime
in
the
united
states,
and
attending
a
meeting
is
witnessing,
counting
the
heads
in
the
room,
is
witnessing
who
the
members
are.
i
mean,
this
leads
to,
which
goes
a
long
distance.
justice
william
o.
douglas
do
you
think
that
the
first
amendment,
as
applied
to
the
states,
is
to
be
read
the
same
as
when
it’s
applied
to
the
federal
government?
