mr.
schroering,
excuse
me,
in
that
connection,
mr.
zingman
made
a
very
appealing
argument
about
the
drawing
up
of
sources
of
information,
what
is
your
response
to
that?
unknown
speaker
[inaudible]
entered
by
judge
meigs,
as
i
read
it,
recognize
as
a
qualified
privileged
newsman.
it’s
not
clear
to
me
from
what
you
have
said,
whether
your
position
here
this
morning
is
that,
you
agree
with
judge
meigs
that
a
qualified
privilege
exist,
or
is
it
your
position
that
no
privilege
whatever
exist?
unknown
speaker
[inaudible]
perhaps
judge
meigs
order
do
not
necessarily
relate
to
crimes
actually
witnessed.
they
reflect
a
recognition
of
a
qualified
privilege
with
respect
to
information.
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
with
this
order
in
that
respect?
unknown
speaker
he
know
that
he
did,
but
i
want
to
know
whether
you
agree
with
him
or
not.
unknown
speaker
this
is
cited
under
the
guidelines
of
the
attorney
general,
that
--
unknown
speaker
i
understand,
i
say
if
they
did
apply,
would
there
be
immunity?
unknown
speaker
but
those
guidelines
are
in
the
brief
of
the
caldwell
case,
i
was
wondering,
has
there
been
any
litigation
under
those?
unknown
speaker
if
the
guidelines
did
apply,
this
was
a
federal
situation,
would
be
a
matter
of
negotiation
between
the
attorney
general
and
the
press.
unknown
speaker
but
the
fact
that
there
are
guidelines,
that
is
by
the
attorney
general,
i
suppose,
suggest
that
we’re
dealing
on
a
pre-sensitive
area.
otherwise,
why
guideline?
unknown
speaker
you
said
the
guidelines
are
based
on
a
recognition
"of
limiting
effects
on
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights."
unknown
speaker
here,
have
we
not
at
least
at
the
threshold,
at
least
we
are
not
talking
about
compulsory
testimony,
we
haven’t
reached
that.
we
are
talking
about
compulsory
attendance,
are
we
not?
unknown
speaker
the
threshold
issue.
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
generally
required,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
except
as
i
learned
yesterday
of
the
oppressed
in
the
united
states.
unknown
speaker
the
compulsory
attendance
is
required
and
it’s
only
after
one
attends
and
is
interrogated
that
he
generally
asserts
the
privilege,
whether
it
be
that
of
an
informer,
or
a
spouse,
or
whatever.
unknown
speaker
that’s
common
grounds,
is
it
not?
