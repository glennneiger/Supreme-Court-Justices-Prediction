in

justice

mr.
standard,
there
is
an
issue
that
seem
to
interrupt
the
court
of
appeals
a
little
bit,
was
this
problem
of
the
jurisdictional
amount
requirement
of
a
section
1331,
title
28,
you
can
leave
that
to
your
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
it
is
unconstitutional?
justice
potter
stewart
you
do
not
think
you
can
exalt,
you
mean,
you
do
not
think
the
congress
can
constitutionally
exalt
the
19th
century
notion
of
property?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
any
summary
would
necessarily
involve
editorial
judgment?
justice

stewart
there
was
an
allegation,
however,
in
his
pleading
that
--
justice

two

well,
i

i
was
just

a
possibility?

was
the

justice

the

had
held
so?
justice

had
finally
--
justice

can
you
tell
us
again
briefly
mr.

what
was
the

issue
in

i
have
the

justice

stewart
yes,
in
boyd
against
clark?
justice
potter
stewart
now
do
i
understand
that
as
of
today,
if
the
state
director
took
an
appeal
as
happened
this

that
there
would
be
notice

an

alright,
but
let
us
assume
that
he
would
have
a
right
to
a
personal
appearance
before
the

board
and
then
let
us
assume
that
today
a
case
come
up
like
this
one
where
he
was
denied
a
personal
appearance.
he
would
not
given
notice
and
he
was
not
given
a
personal

and
his
classification
was
changed
to
i-a
as
it
was
in
this
case
and
then
he
brought
pre-induction
review.
would
you

that
10

bar
pre-induction

where
a

expressly
called
for
a
personal

was

it?
