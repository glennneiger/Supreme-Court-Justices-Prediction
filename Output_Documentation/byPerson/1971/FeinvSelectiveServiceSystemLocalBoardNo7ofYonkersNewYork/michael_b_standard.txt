mr.
michael
b.
standard
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
introduce
david
rosenberg
on
common
brief
in
this
case.
this
case
is
here
by
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
a
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
which
affirmed
the
finding
of
the
district
court
that
it
had
consistent
with
the
standards
of
10
(b)
(3)
of
the
military
selective
service
act
of
1967.
no
jurisdiction
to
review
actions
of
the
selective
service
system
which
removed
a
conscientious
objector
classification,
given
to
petitioner
by
his
local
board
and
i
should
alert
the
court
at
the
outset
to
the
fact
that
since
the
briefing
in
this
case
on
september
28
of
this
year,
congress
has
enacted
a
new
statute.
you
will
find
only
cursory
reference
in
our
reply
brief
filed
on
friday
of
the
week
just
passed
to
that
statute.
that
statute
will
become
i
think
of
considerable
comments
as
the
argument
unfolds.
mr.
michael
b.
standard
what
congress
has
done
is
to
suggest
that
it
is
now
its
policy
that
a
fair
hearing
shall
be
given
to
a
registrant.
i
will
read
the
pertinent
portion
of
the
brief.
“it
is
hereby
declared
to
be
the
purpose
of
this
section
to
guarantee
to
each
registrant,
asserting
a
claim
before
a
local
or
appeal
board,
a
fair
hearing
consistent
with
the
informal
and
expeditious
processing
which
is
required
by
selective
service
cases.”
it
then
goes
on
to
recite
four
particular
standards
which
it
suggests
should
be
the
basis
for
--
mr.
michael
b.
standard
it
is
public
law
92-129,
your
honor
and
its
effective
date
is
september
28,
1971,
just
two
weeks
ago.
mr.
michael
b.
standard
public
law
92-129,
growing
out
of
hr6531,
the
same
session.
it
then
recites
four
particular
instances
which
shall
be
standards
used
by
the
president
or
the
selective
service
system
to
create
reasonable
rules
and
regulations.
two
of
those
standards
are
of
prominence
in
this
case
because
in
effect
it
is
the
enshrining
by
congress
of
the
due
process
arguments
which
we
have
made
in
our
brief.
i
will
read
those
two,
they
are
brief:
“each
registrant
shall
be
afforded
the
opportunity
to
appear
in
person
before
the
local
or
any
appeal
board
of
the
selective
service
system
to
testify
and
present
evidence
regarding
his
status.”
and
the
second
applicable
regulation
that
is
statutory
provision,
“in
the
event
of
a
decision,
adverse
to
the
claim
of
a
registrant,
the
local
or
appeal
board
in
making
such
decision
shall
upon
request,
furnish
each
registrant
a
brief
written
statement
of
the
reasons
for
its
decision.”
mr.
michael
b.
standard
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
i
said
a
cursory
mention
was
made
in
petitioner’s
reply
brief.
mr.
michael
b.
standard
well,
you
will
find
the
text
i
believe
on
page
2
of
the
reply
brief.
at
least
the
text
of
the
provisions
i
had
just
read
to
you.
the
fact
is
just
simple
and
they
are
not
in
dispute
essentially.
the
plaintiff
is
a
doctor
of
medicine.
in
september
of
1967,
while
occupationally
deferred
as
an
intern
at
western
reserve
medical
school,
holding
a
ii-a
classification,
he
wrote
to
his
board
and
he
indicated
to
his
board
that
moral
convictions
are
empty
unless
substantiated
by
moral
acts
and
he
asked
his
board
to
send
him
a
150
conscientious
objector
application
form.
mr.
michael
b.
standard
he
has
been,
well,
in
1960
--
he
completed
his
internship
in
1967
in
june,
i
am
sorry
1968
in
june
and
he
has
been
a
doctor
since
then.
he
is
now
31
years
of
age,
mr.
justice.
mr.
michael
b.
standard
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
b.
standard
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
b.
standard
i
would
say
that
it
ripened
at
the
moment
when
he
wrote
to
his
board,
although
it
is
quite
clear
and
his
application
makes
quite
clear
in
terms
of
the
length
of
time
that
it
took
him
to
get
to
that
position.
i
would
say
that
the
day
you
would
fix
it
would
be
the
day
when
he
makes
that
day
in
1967,
when
he
wrote
to
his
board
saying
my
claim
has
matured
and
history
of
the
registrant
in
this
regard
is
quite
pertinent.
the
registrant
has
and
reflected
in
the
co
application,
a
traditional
lutheran
background.
mr.
michael
b.
standard
well,
i
do
not
suggest
that
he
has
ever
been
a
formal
member
of
the
lutheran
church
in
recent
years
and
i
cannot
tell
you
which.
i
am
not
a
lutheran
myself
your
honor.
i
never
thought
to
inquire
mr.
justice
blackmun
as
to
which
--
mr.
michael
b.
standard
i
am
sorry
i
do
not
know
that,
but
the
petitioner
does
not
rely
on
a
particular
sect
that
he
or
his
family
may
have
been
a
member
on.
in
coming
to
his
conscientious
objector
position,
he
refers
to
early
training
by
his
parents,
early
and
attentive
training
by
his
parents
in
the
church
tradition.
he
refers
to
his
matriculation
(inaudible)
college
to
his
activity
in
the
civil
rights
movement
and
finally
to
the
vocation
of
medicine
which
for
him
reflected
a
vocational
method
of
acting
out
of
his
views
with
regard
to
non-violence.
his
application
in
response
to
the
question;
do
you
believe
in
the
supreme
being,
was
answered
in
affirmative.
in
addition
to
the
strict
religious
basis
for
his
application
however,
he
referred
to
a
broader
moral
standard,
he
believes
that
man
believed,
the
members
in
the
community
among
men
and
then
one
cannot
take
right
under
any
circumstances.
it
is
certainly
clear,
although
i
do
not
think
it
is
an
issue
in
this
case
because
the
posture
of
this
case
at
this
moment
as
i
understand
it
is
that
there
is
no
question
about
the
propriety
of
his
classification
of
processing.
what
we
are
here
doing
is
attacking
an
appellate
regulatory
procedure
which
is
riven
with
due
process
violations.
the
application
which
he
filed
with
board,
however,
between
september
and
november
of
1967,
was
supported
by
reference
letters
from
regiment,
from
the
dean
of
the
medical
school,
from
colleagues
and
from
friends,
all
of
them
are
testing
for
two
things;
first
to
his
sincerity
and
second
to
the
nature
of
his
belief.
in
november
of
1967,
fein
appeared,
when
interviewed
before
his
local
board,
at
that
interview,
he
was
canvassed,
rather
carefully
in
detail
as
what
his
reference
letters
with
regard
to
the
nature
of
his
religious
belief
and
to
whether
he
would
perform
alternative
service
that
is
alternative
non-combatant
service.
fein
unequivocally
took
the
position
at
that
time
that
he
would
perform
any
work
in
the
national
interest,
any
where
in
the
united
states.
he
expressed
the
hope
that
he
might
use
his
capacity
as
physician
to
aid
in
some
activity
preferably
in
a
ghetto
constituted
area
and
in
addition
parenthetically,
he
said,
my
wife
is
a
physician
and
if
we
could
find
a
place
to
work
together
that
would
please
us,
but
is
not
necessary.
he
was
then
asked
about
the
nature
of
his
religious
belief
and
unequivocally
asserted
a
belief
stated
in
both
traditional
supreme
being,
pre-seega
(ph)
and
in
seega
--
i
suppose
what
we
would
now
call
(inaudible)
in
seega
terms,
relying
on
the
moral
attack.
the
board
in
response
to
the
ii-a
classification
which
the
registrant
then
held
said,
“we
will
not
find
you
a
conscientious
objector
at
this
time.
we
will
retain
you
in
your
ii-a
classification”
and
it
said,
“we
will
give
a
right
to
appeal
when
and
if
the
moment
ever
comes.”
well,
that
moment
did
come.
in
february
of
1968,
the
registrant
was
re-classified
i-a
from
his
ii-a
classification
and
in
timely
fashion,
he
asked
his
board
for
another
personal
interview.
the
board
granted
that
interview
on
may
22.
in
anticipation
of
that
interview,
the
registrant
filed
with
the
board
a
series
of
answers
to
questions
which
appear
to
be
troubling
the
board
at
its
earlier
november
interview,
particularly
those
with
regard
to
the
position
of
a
lutheran
church.
you
will
find
that
i
believe
annexed
to
the
government’s
brief
at
page,
i
do
not
have
the
citation,
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
the
substance
of
the
second
meeting
before
the
local
board
was
similar
to
that
of
the
first.
they
asked
if
he
would
perform
an
alternative
service
and
he
said,
of
course
i
would.
they
asked
the
nature
of
his
religious
belief
and
series
of
other
questions
which
he
apparently
answered
satisfactory
because
his
board
on
that
day,
may
22,
1968,
gave
him
his
conscientious
objector
classification.
ten
days
later,
the
state
director
appealed
to
the
new
york
state
appeal
board.
procedurally,
what
the
state
director
did
was
to
notify,
not
the
registrant
of
that
fact,
but
notified
the
appeal
board
and
the
local
board
and
it
is
the
local
board
which
in
turn
notifies
the
registrant.
as
soon
as
the
registrant
became
aware
that
there
was
an
appeal
taken,
after
a
finding
by
this
linchpin
of
the
selective
service
system,
the
local
board,
that's
phenomena
which
is
your
friends
and
neighbors,
your
community,
a
theory
of
none
of
that.
the
registrant
wrote
to
the
appeal
board
and
said
i
do
not
understand
this
and
i
now
bewildered
and
surprised,
but
i
would
like
an
opportunity
to
get
a
statement
of
reasons
from
the
state
director
or
from
the
appeal
board.
i
do
not
know
what
it
is
that
he
has
in
mind
when
he
in
effect
reverses,
or
appeals
from
a
finding
of
i-0
classification,
no
pertinent
response
to
that
letter.
secondly,
registrant
inquires
of
the
appeal
board,
what
are
the
issues?
what
are
the
reasons?
no
pertinent
response
from
the
appeal
board.
registrant
then
says,
i
like
a
chance
to
appear
before
the
appeal
board
or
at
least
to
rebut
somehow
issues
which
are
in
the
dark.
no
pertinent
response
except
for
a
minute
of
action,
dated
in
july
which
in
effect
revoked
his
conscientious
objector
classification
by
unanimous
vote
and
returned
him
to
a
i-a
classification.
now,
by
selective
service
regulation,
a
registrant
has
no
right
to
appeal
to
the
presidential
appeal
board
unless
there
has
been
a
dissent
below.
the
registrant
nevertheless
wrote
to
the
then
selective
service,
director
general
hershey
and
described
his
case
and
asked
the
good
offices
of
general
hershey
in
asking
the
appeal
board
to
review
his
case.
general
hershey
did
so,
although
he
made
no
recommendation
of
any
kind,
although
he
nor
the
appeal
board
nor
the
presidential
appeal
board
never
stated
what
issues,
there
were
present
as
a
reason
to
the
appeal,
never
stated
any
reasons,
that
is
the
appeal
board
never
stated
any
reasons.
following
transmission
of
the
file,
the
presidential
appeal
board
unanimously,
stating
no
reasons,
found
that
the
registrant
should
be
retained
in
a
i-a
classification.
it
is
important
to
remember,
particularly
in
terms
of
issue
of
standards
to
raise
this
question
that
in
this
period,
two
things
occurred,
in
a
period
of
may
though
october.
number
one,
the
registrant
was
ordered
to
report
for
induction,
that
notice
report
for
induction
as
must
by
regulation
was
postponed
during
the
appellate
process
and
eventually
canceled.
in
february
of
1969,
this
action
was
brought
in
district
court
of
southern
district
of
new
york.
judge
tyler
never
reached
the
merits
of
the
case
at
all,
never
reached
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
in
due
process
terms
of
the
appellate
regulatory
scheme.
he
expressed
uncertainty
to
be
sure
about
the
findings
of
this
court
in
its
per
curiam
opinion
in
boyd
against
clark,
but
said
clark
against
gabriel
controls
10
(b)
(3)
is
a
bar.
on
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals,
there
were
three
decisions.
judge
blumenfeld
sustained
what
judge
tyler
did
below,
namely
he
said
10
(b)
(3)
is
a
bar.
judge
blumenfeld
suggested
that
merely
because
issues
were
framed
in
a
legal
manner
that
that
would
not
permit
us
to
avoid
the
questions
of
classification
by
processing
which
he
found
that
we
were
attacking.
let
me
repeat,
we
are
not
here
today
nor
we
have
been
or
have
we
been
in
any
court,
attacking
the
question
of
propriety
of
classification
in
any
manner.
we
are
rather
attacking
the
method
used
by
this
complex
selective
service
regulatory
body.
we
are
attacking
the
standards
or
the
lack
of
standards
rather
in
the
sense
that
they
never
framed
any
issues,
a
registrant
is
always
in
the
dark.
mr.
michael
b.
standard
that
is
correct.
now
that
led
to
be
sure
to
ascertain
result
and
led
to
a
revocation,
but
we
attack
in
the
process
only,
not
the
finding.
we
are
not
doing
what
congress
has
warned
us
against.
we
are
not
introducing
litigious
interruption
into
the
process.
what
we
are
trying
to
do
in
fact
is
to
avoid
litigious
interruption
of
that
process.
what
we
are
trying
to
do
is
to
say
as
justice
steel
(ph)
said
in
the
wiener
case
where
there
was
a
similar
question
of
the
propriety
of
appellate
review
by
the
state
director,
send
it
back
to
the
local
board,
let
him
know
the
reasons.
in
fact,
there
are
perhaps
four
or
five
cases
in
which
issues
of
similar
construction
of
the
appellate
regulatory
system
had
been
at
issue.
one
of
them,
just
a
year
ago
mr.
justice
blackmun
said
in
united
states
against
cummins,
i
do
not
know
if
your
honor
recalls
it,
in
which
you
concurred
in
a
finding
that
there
was
a
violation
of
procedural
due
process.
issue
on
that
case
was
only
slightly
different.
in
that
case
what
had
happened
was
that
the
registrant
had
been
the
subject
of
an
appeal
by
the
state
director
and
there
had
been
a
statement
of
reasons,
but
he
had
never
been
notified,
never
been
notified
of
what
the
state
director's
position
was.
now,
i
think
that
the
statements
of
the
fact
to
this
case
effectively
states
the
due
process
argument.
i
do
not
want
to
burden
the
court
with
reference
to
the
cases
which
we
have
briefed
which
we
feel
are
particularly
relevant
here.
i
think
this
case
can
be
dispose
of
on
the
merits,
that
is
substantive
merits,
by
referring
to
simmons
and
gonzales
and
where
general
cases
regarding
the
process
such
as
goldberg
against
kelly.
now,
we
come
to
the
procedural
question
which
is
of
some
importance.
it
is
our
view
that
given
the
new
statute
to
which
i
have
referred,
congress
has
enshrined
in
effect
the
constitutional
standard
which
we
have
always
argued
was
implicit,
implicit
in
the
1967
act
and
we
suggest
that
this
case
be
remanded
to
the
appeal
board
of
the
selective
service
system
who
are
processing
inconsistent
with
the
standards
which
we
now
know,
which
we
had
always
argued
what
constitutional
standards
but
which
congress
has
now
set
aside.
mr.
michael
b.
standard
well,
that
is
a
puzzle
your
honor,
i
cannot
pretend
since
the
act,
and
it
was
effective
on
september
28,
we
haven't
done
any
thorough
search,
but
i
can
refer
your
honor
to
two
cases,
where
apart
from
the
retroactivity
with
regard
to
other
selective
service
registrants
who
are
somewhere
in
the
process,
i
do
not
refer
to
them
at
all.
now,
with
regards
to
find,
it
has
been
and
this
court
reflected
in
u.s.
against
alabama
which
you'll
find
in
362
u.s.
and
in
ziffrin
against
the
united
states
which
you'll
find
in
318
that
where
there
is
a
change
in
the
law
between
the
court
of
original
jurisdiction
position
and
the
appeal
court’s
position
that
the
new
law
applies
and
we
suggest
that
it
applies
here.
mr.
michael
b.
standard
in
this
case
--
mr.
michael
b.
standard
--
it
applies
to
our
reply
in
this
petition
because
there
has
been
a
change
between
the
--
mr.
michael
b.
standard
that
is
correct.
i
take
no
position
because
i
do
not
pretend
to
have
briefed
the
question
of
retroactivity
for
others.
now,
should
this
court
find
that
the
new
statute
not
apply,
and
i
cannot
find
any
reason
why
you
might,
but
should
you
find
that
it
does
not
apply,
we
are
back
to
the
laws
which
this
court
in
oestereich
and
breen
placed
on
section
10
(b)
(3).
the
court
will
recall
that
in
those
two
cases,
one
case
of
ministerial
exemption,
one
case
of
student
deferment,
there
was
an
explicit
statutory
authorization
giving
both
of
those
classifications
and
the
local
board
as
this
court
have
found,
in
a
majority
of
this
court
found
in
an
excess
of
its
authority,
that
there
was
a
local
board
which
was
in
excess
of
its
authority,
reclassify
and
accelerated
deduction.
now,
if
we
are
back
to
the
old
problem
of
oestereich
and
breen
on
one
hand,
and
clark
versus
gabriel
on
the
other
hand,
i
understand
that
we
do
not
attack
classification
for
processing
here.
we
are
only
attacking
an
appellant
regulatory
scheme.
then
i
suggest,
this
is
clearly
within
the
oestereich
decision
by
statute,
when
a
local
board,
it
is
a
registrant
conscientious
objector
status
on
statute
that
is
final,
unless
an
appeal
is
authorized
by
rules
and
regulations
and
here
if
you
refer
back
to
that
appellant
regulatory
scheme,
you
will
find
no
authorization
except
the
generality,
which
describes
just
rules
and
regulations.
it
seems
to
me
in
a
case
which
transients
so
clearly
in
an
area
of
personal
liberty,
there
have
to
be
as
in
(inaudible)
against
dallas.
there
have
and
to
be
standards
which
are
explicit.
now,
congress
understands
that
quite
clearly
because
in
the
new
act,
it
does
not
merely
say,
there
is
a
right
to
appear
before
an
appeal
board
or
you
have
a
right
to
written
findings
or
written
reasons
rather.
what
it
says
is
pursuant
to
such
rules
and
regulations
as
the
president
may
prescribe
and
then
it
creates
the
standards,
but
nowhere
in
the
1967
act
are
there
any
standards
which
are
authorized
by
congress.
so
i
believe
that
we
are
in
a
classic
oestereich
situation
with
regard
to
the
burden
of
the
government’s
argument
which
has
been
that
there
really
is
burden
here
of
question
classification
of
processing.
i
notice
that
the
solicitor
general
finally
at
page
13
of
his
brief
agrees
that
this
court
supports
our
position.
it
says
this
court
is
not
now
called
upon
to
determine
whether
the
assigned
classification
is
wholly
without
factual
basis.
i
would
point
that
parenthetically
that
while
we
are
not
asking
the
court
to
deal
with
question
of
classification,
but
the
government
seems
to
suggest,
although
its
silent
as
to
reason
that
there
was
no
prima
facie
case
made
out
here
or
conscientious
objector
classification.
now,
maybe
there
is
something
that
i
do
not
know
about.
maybe,
although
it
does
not
appear
on
the
record,
the
record
is
silent
in
this
regard,
the
government
has
unequivocally
taken
the
position
that
there
was
no
statement
given
by
the
state
director
to
the
appeal
board.
if
that
is
so,
i
do
not
understand
how
it
can,
as
it
does
in
this
court,
can
test
the
validity
of
the
co
classification.
was
there
an
oral
communication
which
is
not
part
of
the
record,
we
do
not
know.
that
is
precisely
why
the
due
process
standards
we
are
urging
here
are
as
important
as
we
feel
they
are.
this
is
not,
however,
merely
a
case
of
prima
facie
classification.
here
we
had
a
local
board,
having
come
to
a
conclusion
that
a
registrant
was
classifiable
as
i-0.
i
would
suggest
the
court
that
it
either
do
one
of
two
things;
that
it
apply
the
new
public
law
92-129,
follow
the
standards
there
set
in,
refer
this
back
to
selective
service
system
for
review
in
light
of
those
standards,
that
pending
that
the
district
court
reinstate
finding
his
i-o
classification,
that
is
number
one.
alternatively,
although
the
relief
we
believe
should
be
the
same
that
it
apply
the
standards
that
it
has
recited
as
the
laws
in
oestereich
and
breen
to
10
(b)
(3)
of
the
act,
that
it
understand
that
we
attacking
a
system
of
classification,
not
classification
itself.
mr.
michael
b.
standard
yes
sir.
mr.
michael
b.
standard
yes,
but
i
confess
your
honor
because
of
the
newness
of
the
statute
that
while
i
had
begun
what
is
now
a
2000
case
search
to
canvass
both
the
senate
hearings
and
the
house
hearings,
i
find
only
two
references
and
in
going
through
the
senate.
the
only
testimony
which
explicitly
suggested
that
these
appellate
rights,
these
procedural
due
process
rights,
both
the
appeal
and
the
local
board
were
authored
by
mr.
(inaudible)
of
the
american
civil
liberties
union.
there
is
however
--
mr.
michael
b.
standard
no
certainly
not.
there
is,
however
–-
mr.
michael
b.
standard
that
is
true
and
i
do
not
pretend
that
the
search
has
ended
as
it
just
begun,
given
the
newness
of
the
statute
and
i
would
be
glad
if
the
court
desired
to
brief
that
and
ask
permission
to
do
so.
there
is
however,
in
the
91st
congress
first
session,
a
study
made
of
the
selective
service
system
with
recommendation
for
administrative
improvement.
that
was
submitted
by
the
administrative
practice
and
sub-committee
on
administrative
practice
and
procedure
to
the
senate
judiciary
committee
and
there
you
will
find
and
particularly
on
pages
or
it
would
be
the
section
running
9
through
11,
you
find
precisely
these
recommendations,
are
those
of
course
not
followed.
it
was
followed
by
the
conference
report
here
for
example.
one
of
the
issues
raised
was
the
right
to
counsel
at
the
local
board
appearance.
congress
in
a
conference
report
did
not
adopt
the
recommendations
for
administrative
improvement
made
in
the
study
i
have
just
referred
to,
but
rather
took
the
position
that
it
would
really
impede
the
selective
service
classification
process,
and
therefore,
did
not
adopt
that.
the
other
four
recommendations,
however,
of
the
senate
committee
were
adopted
at
the
conference.
mr.
michael
b.
standard
i
have
briefed
that
question,
your
honor.
i
will
be
glad
to
allude
to
it
briefly
in
the
following
ways.
first
there
was
a
classic
and
standard
answer,
there
has
been
an
allegation
in
this
complaint
of
damage
of
$10,000.00
amount
controversy
and
i
do
not
think
it
can
be
gain
set
by
anyone
or
is
it
that
this
petitioner
can
meet
that
statutory
requirement.
i
think
however
that
they
are
words
are
here,
a
constitutional
question
of
the
proportion,
if
this
action
had
been
begun
in
the
district
of
columbia,
it
would
be
$10,000.00
jurisdiction
on
that
as
congress
does
not
impose
that
amount.
in
the
district
unlike
every
other
district
in
the
united
states,
more
importantly
and
i
think
the
full
answer
is,
full
answer
i
choose
to
give
was
that
given
by
judge
angelstein
(ph)
in
dissent
below
in
the
three-judge
court
in
boyd
against
clark.
i
do
not
believe
you
can
exalt
a
19th
century
notion
of
property
in
cases
where
substantial
federal
rights
are
at
issue,
i
think
the
government
has
acknowledged
that
there
are
substantial
federal
rights
at
issue
here
and
i
do
not
think
that
1331
should
adhere
to
be
a
barred
against
the
jurisdiction.
mr.
michael
b.
standard
i
would
say
--
mr.
michael
b.
standard
well,
i
--
let
me
amend
that,
i
think
it
can.
i
think
it's
(inaudible)
when
it
does.
mr.
michael
b.
standard
do
i
recede
from
the
position
that
that
was
in
fact
what
occurred,
no,
your
honor,
not
at
all.
i
have
never
seen
that.
it
has
been
characterized
by
the
then
united
states
attorney
martin
solomon
as
merely
a
summary
prepared
by
the
clerk
to
enable
the
appeal
board
to
understand
what
the
issue
is.
you
will
find
his
affidavits,
i
believe
on
the
pages
following.
you
will
find
on
page
89
(i).
i
certainly
do
not
recede,
but
that
is
not
the
kind
of
notice
which
i
think
that
both
the
constitution
then
and
always
and
congress
now
requires.
mr.
michael
b.
standard
well,
what
had
happened
was
that
subsequent
to
the
argument
before
judge
tyler
in
this
case,
in
reviewing
the
record,
i
found
a
letter
which
was
dated
june
20th
from
--
which
was
then
from
the
clerk
of
the
local
board
to
the
appeal
board
and
it
said,
“please
be
advised
that
we
have
already
made
up
the
brief
on
the
above
named
subject
and
is
to
go
into
today’s
meeting.”
i,
therefore,
submitted
a
post
argument
that
is
post
the
argument
before
judge
tyler,
affidavit,
indicated
that
it
was
the
central
to
the
government’s
position,
but
that
nothing
else
had
happened
and
now
i
find
that
indeed
something
else
had
happened,
there
had
been
some
notification
and
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
in
response
then
said
that
there
was
nothing
which
was
meritorious,
something
which
went
to
the
substance
in
that
regard,
but
rather
was
merely
a
synopsis
by
the
clerk
to
the
appeal
board
in
this
process.
mr.
michael
b.
standard
no.
mr.
michael
b.
standard
no,
i
think
mr.
justice
blackmun,
you
have
misunderstood
if
you
thought
i
was
insinuating.
it
was
a
lawyer’s
brief,
by
i
used
the
phrase
brief
in
a
colloquial
sense,
that
is
it
was
a
synopsis,
a
play
stick
if
you
will,
of
what
was
going
to
be
presented
to
the
appeal
board.
it
was
prepared
by
a
non-lawyer,
a
clerk
not
by
anyone
of
the
state
director’s
office,
of
that
i
am
satisfied.
mr.
michael
b.
standard
no,
i
am
not
dissatisfied
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
b.
standard
that
would
have,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
michael
b.
standard
i
am
sorry.
mr.
michael
b.
standard
well,
i
think
if
it
were
a
listing
of
the
docket
entries
which
are
ordinarily
attached
to
the
coversheet
and
where
as
i
understand
appellate
practice,
that
would
never
occur.
i
think
it
would
have
been
referred
to
as
docket
entries,
but
i
think
the
use
of
english
language
is
simple.
i
mean,
when
the
word
“brief”
is
used
it
means
a
brief,
although
not
necessarily
in
a
lawyer
sense,
if
docket
entries
were
sent
up,
it
would
be
called
docket
entries.
mr.
michael
b.
standard
she
was
the
clerk
of
the
board
and
she
could
have
made
an
error.
the
record
is
silent
in
that
regard,
we
really
do
not
know.
mr.
michael
b.
standard
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
introduce
david
rosenberg
on
common
brief
in
this
case.
this
case
is
here
by
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
a
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
which
affirmed
the
finding
of
the
district
court
that
it
had
consistent
with
the
standards
of
10
(b)
(3)
of
the
military
selective
service
act
of
1967.
no
jurisdiction
to
review
actions
of
the
selective
service
system
which
removed
a
conscientious
objector
classification,
given
to
petitioner
by
his
local
board
and
i
should
alert
the
court
at
the
outset
to
the
fact
that
since
the
briefing
in
this
case
on
september
28
of
this
year,
congress
has
enacted
a
new
statute.
you
will
find
only
cursory
reference
in
our
reply
brief
filed
on
friday
of
the
week
just
passed
to
that
statute.
that
statute
will
become
i
think
of
considerable
comments
as
the
argument
unfolds.
mr.
michael
b.
standard
what
congress
has
done
is
to
suggest
that
it
is
now
its
policy
that
a
fair
hearing
shall
be
given
to
a
registrant.
i
will
read
the
pertinent
portion
of
the
brief.
“it
is
hereby
declared
to
be
the
purpose
of
this
section
to
guarantee
to
each
registrant,
asserting
a
claim
before
a
local
or
appeal
board,
a
fair
hearing
consistent
with
the
informal
and
expeditious
processing
which
is
required
by
selective
service
cases.”
it
then
goes
on
to
recite
four
particular
standards
which
it
suggests
should
be
the
basis
for
--
mr.
michael
b.
standard
it
is
public
law
92-129,
your
honor
and
its
effective
date
is
september
28,
1971,
just
two
weeks
ago.
mr.
michael
b.
standard
public
law
92-129,
growing
out
of
hr6531,
the
same
session.
it
then
recites
four
particular
instances
which
shall
be
standards
used
by
the
president
or
the
selective
service
system
to
create
reasonable
rules
and
regulations.
two
of
those
standards
are
of
prominence
in
this
case
because
in
effect
it
is
the
enshrining
by
congress
of
the
due
process
arguments
which
we
have
made
in
our
brief.
i
will
read
those
two,
they
are
brief:
“each
registrant
shall
be
afforded
the
opportunity
to
appear
in
person
before
the
local
or
any
appeal
board
of
the
selective
service
system
to
testify
and
present
evidence
regarding
his
status.”
and
the
second
applicable
regulation
that
is
statutory
provision,
“in
the
event
of
a
decision,
adverse
to
the
claim
of
a
registrant,
the
local
or
appeal
board
in
making
such
decision
shall
upon
request,
furnish
each
registrant
a
brief
written
statement
of
the
reasons
for
its
decision.”
mr.
michael
b.
standard
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
i
said
a
cursory
mention
was
made
in
petitioner’s
reply
brief.
mr.
michael
b.
standard
well,
you
will
find
the
text
i
believe
on
page
2
of
the
reply
brief.
at
least
the
text
of
the
provisions
i
had
just
read
to
you.
the
fact
is
just
simple
and
they
are
not
in
dispute
essentially.
the
plaintiff
is
a
doctor
of
medicine.
in
september
of
1967,
while
occupationally
deferred
as
an
intern
at
western
reserve
medical
school,
holding
a
ii-a
classification,
he
wrote
to
his
board
and
he
indicated
to
his
board
that
moral
convictions
are
empty
unless
substantiated
by
moral
acts
and
he
asked
his
board
to
send
him
a
150
conscientious
objector
application
form.
mr.
michael
b.
standard
he
has
been,
well,
in
1960
--
he
completed
his
internship
in
1967
in
june,
i
am
sorry
1968
in
june
and
he
has
been
a
doctor
since
then.
he
is
now
31
years
of
age,
mr.
justice.
mr.
michael
b.
standard
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
b.
standard
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
b.
standard
i
would
say
that
it
ripened
at
the
moment
when
he
wrote
to
his
board,
although
it
is
quite
clear
and
his
application
makes
quite
clear
in
terms
of
the
length
of
time
that
it
took
him
to
get
to
that
position.
i
would
say
that
the
day
you
would
fix
it
would
be
the
day
when
he
makes
that
day
in
1967,
when
he
wrote
to
his
board
saying
my
claim
has
matured
and
history
of
the
registrant
in
this
regard
is
quite
pertinent.
the
registrant
has
and
reflected
in
the
co
application,
a
traditional
lutheran
background.
mr.
michael
b.
standard
well,
i
do
not
suggest
that
he
has
ever
been
a
formal
member
of
the
lutheran
church
in
recent
years
and
i
cannot
tell
you
which.
i
am
not
a
lutheran
myself
your
honor.
i
never
thought
to
inquire
mr.
justice
blackmun
as
to
which
--
mr.
michael
b.
standard
i
am
sorry
i
do
not
know
that,
but
the
petitioner
does
not
rely
on
a
particular
sect
that
he
or
his
family
may
have
been
a
member
on.
in
coming
to
his
conscientious
objector
position,
he
refers
to
early
training
by
his
parents,
early
and
attentive
training
by
his
parents
in
the
church
tradition.
he
refers
to
his
matriculation
(inaudible)
college
to
his
activity
in
the
civil
rights
movement
and
finally
to
the
vocation
of
medicine
which
for
him
reflected
a
vocational
method
of
acting
out
of
his
views
with
regard
to
non-violence.
his
application
in
response
to
the
question;
do
you
believe
in
the
supreme
being,
was
answered
in
affirmative.
in
addition
to
the
strict
religious
basis
for
his
application
however,
he
referred
to
a
broader
moral
standard,
he
believes
that
man
believed,
the
members
in
the
community
among
men
and
then
one
cannot
take
right
under
any
circumstances.
it
is
certainly
clear,
although
i
do
not
think
it
is
an
issue
in
this
case
because
the
posture
of
this
case
at
this
moment
as
i
understand
it
is
that
there
is
no
question
about
the
propriety
of
his
classification
of
processing.
what
we
are
here
doing
is
attacking
an
appellate
regulatory
procedure
which
is
riven
with
due
process
violations.
the
application
which
he
filed
with
board,
however,
between
september
and
november
of
1967,
was
supported
by
reference
letters
from
regiment,
from
the
dean
of
the
medical
school,
from
colleagues
and
from
friends,
all
of
them
are
testing
for
two
things;
first
to
his
sincerity
and
second
to
the
nature
of
his
belief.
in
november
of
1967,
fein
appeared,
when
interviewed
before
his
local
board,
at
that
interview,
he
was
canvassed,
rather
carefully
in
detail
as
what
his
reference
letters
with
regard
to
the
nature
of
his
religious
belief
and
to
whether
he
would
perform
alternative
service
that
is
alternative
non-combatant
service.
fein
unequivocally
took
the
position
at
that
time
that
he
would
perform
any
work
in
the
national
interest,
any
where
in
the
united
states.
he
expressed
the
hope
that
he
might
use
his
capacity
as
physician
to
aid
in
some
activity
preferably
in
a
ghetto
constituted
area
and
in
addition
parenthetically,
he
said,
my
wife
is
a
physician
and
if
we
could
find
a
place
to
work
together
that
would
please
us,
but
is
not
necessary.
he
was
then
asked
about
the
nature
of
his
religious
belief
and
unequivocally
asserted
a
belief
stated
in
both
traditional
supreme
being,
pre-seega
(ph)
and
in
seega
--
i
suppose
what
we
would
now
call
(inaudible)
in
seega
terms,
relying
on
the
moral
attack.
the
board
in
response
to
the
ii-a
classification
which
the
registrant
then
held
said,
“we
will
not
find
you
a
conscientious
objector
at
this
time.
we
will
retain
you
in
your
ii-a
classification”
and
it
said,
“we
will
give
a
right
to
appeal
when
and
if
the
moment
ever
comes.”
well,
that
moment
did
come.
in
february
of
1968,
the
registrant
was
re-classified
i-a
from
his
ii-a
classification
and
in
timely
fashion,
he
asked
his
board
for
another
personal
interview.
the
board
granted
that
interview
on
may
22.
in
anticipation
of
that
interview,
the
registrant
filed
with
the
board
a
series
of
answers
to
questions
which
appear
to
be
troubling
the
board
at
its
earlier
november
interview,
particularly
those
with
regard
to
the
position
of
a
lutheran
church.
you
will
find
that
i
believe
annexed
to
the
government’s
brief
at
page,
i
do
not
have
the
citation,
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
the
substance
of
the
second
meeting
before
the
local
board
was
similar
to
that
of
the
first.
they
asked
if
he
would
perform
an
alternative
service
and
he
said,
of
course
i
would.
they
asked
the
nature
of
his
religious
belief
and
series
of
other
questions
which
he
apparently
answered
satisfactory
because
his
board
on
that
day,
may
22,
1968,
gave
him
his
conscientious
objector
classification.
ten
days
later,
the
state
director
appealed
to
the
new
york
state
appeal
board.
procedurally,
what
the
state
director
did
was
to
notify,
not
the
registrant
of
that
fact,
but
notified
the
appeal
board
and
the
local
board
and
it
is
the
local
board
which
in
turn
notifies
the
registrant.
as
soon
as
the
registrant
became
aware
that
there
was
an
appeal
taken,
after
a
finding
by
this
linchpin
of
the
selective
service
system,
the
local
board,
that's
phenomena
which
is
your
friends
and
neighbors,
your
community,
a
theory
of
none
of
that.
the
registrant
wrote
to
the
appeal
board
and
said
i
do
not
understand
this
and
i
now
bewildered
and
surprised,
but
i
would
like
an
opportunity
to
get
a
statement
of
reasons
from
the
state
director
or
from
the
appeal
board.
i
do
not
know
what
it
is
that
he
has
in
mind
when
he
in
effect
reverses,
or
appeals
from
a
finding
of
i-0
classification,
no
pertinent
response
to
that
letter.
secondly,
registrant
inquires
of
the
appeal
board,
what
are
the
issues?
what
are
the
reasons?
no
pertinent
response
from
the
appeal
board.
registrant
then
says,
i
like
a
chance
to
appear
before
the
appeal
board
or
at
least
to
rebut
somehow
issues
which
are
in
the
dark.
no
pertinent
response
except
for
a
minute
of
action,
dated
in
july
which
in
effect
revoked
his
conscientious
objector
classification
by
unanimous
vote
and
returned
him
to
a
i-a
classification.
now,
by
selective
service
regulation,
a
registrant
has
no
right
to
appeal
to
the
presidential
appeal
board
unless
there
has
been
a
dissent
below.
the
registrant
nevertheless
wrote
to
the
then
selective
service,
director
general
hershey
and
described
his
case
and
asked
the
good
offices
of
general
hershey
in
asking
the
appeal
board
to
review
his
case.
general
hershey
did
so,
although
he
made
no
recommendation
of
any
kind,
although
he
nor
the
appeal
board
nor
the
presidential
appeal
board
never
stated
what
issues,
there
were
present
as
a
reason
to
the
appeal,
never
stated
any
reasons,
that
is
the
appeal
board
never
stated
any
reasons.
following
transmission
of
the
file,
the
presidential
appeal
board
unanimously,
stating
no
reasons,
found
that
the
registrant
should
be
retained
in
a
i-a
classification.
it
is
important
to
remember,
particularly
in
terms
of
issue
of
standards
to
raise
this
question
that
in
this
period,
two
things
occurred,
in
a
period
of
may
though
october.
number
one,
the
registrant
was
ordered
to
report
for
induction,
that
notice
report
for
induction
as
must
by
regulation
was
postponed
during
the
appellate
process
and
eventually
canceled.
in
february
of
1969,
this
action
was
brought
in
district
court
of
southern
district
of
new
york.
judge
tyler
never
reached
the
merits
of
the
case
at
all,
never
reached
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
in
due
process
terms
of
the
appellate
regulatory
scheme.
he
expressed
uncertainty
to
be
sure
about
the
findings
of
this
court
in
its
per
curiam
opinion
in
boyd
against
clark,
but
said
clark
against
gabriel
controls
10
(b)
(3)
is
a
bar.
on
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals,
there
were
three
decisions.
judge
blumenfeld
sustained
what
judge
tyler
did
below,
namely
he
said
10
(b)
(3)
is
a
bar.
judge
blumenfeld
suggested
that
merely
because
issues
were
framed
in
a
legal
manner
that
that
would
not
permit
us
to
avoid
the
questions
of
classification
by
processing
which
he
found
that
we
were
attacking.
let
me
repeat,
we
are
not
here
today
nor
we
have
been
or
have
we
been
in
any
court,
attacking
the
question
of
propriety
of
classification
in
any
manner.
we
are
rather
attacking
the
method
used
by
this
complex
selective
service
regulatory
body.
we
are
attacking
the
standards
or
the
lack
of
standards
rather
in
the
sense
that
they
never
framed
any
issues,
a
registrant
is
always
in
the
dark.
mr.
michael
b.
standard
that
is
correct.
now
that
led
to
be
sure
to
ascertain
result
and
led
to
a
revocation,
but
we
attack
in
the
process
only,
not
the
finding.
we
are
not
doing
what
congress
has
warned
us
against.
we
are
not
introducing
litigious
interruption
into
the
process.
what
we
are
trying
to
do
in
fact
is
to
avoid
litigious
interruption
of
that
process.
what
we
are
trying
to
do
is
to
say
as
justice
steel
(ph)
said
in
the
wiener
case
where
there
was
a
similar
question
of
the
propriety
of
appellate
review
by
the
state
director,
send
it
back
to
the
local
board,
let
him
know
the
reasons.
in
fact,
there
are
perhaps
four
or
five
cases
in
which
issues
of
similar
construction
of
the
appellate
regulatory
system
had
been
at
issue.
one
of
them,
just
a
year
ago
mr.
justice
blackmun
said
in
united
states
against
cummins,
i
do
not
know
if
your
honor
recalls
it,
in
which
you
concurred
in
a
finding
that
there
was
a
violation
of
procedural
due
process.
issue
on
that
case
was
only
slightly
different.
in
that
case
what
had
happened
was
that
the
registrant
had
been
the
subject
of
an
appeal
by
the
state
director
and
there
had
been
a
statement
of
reasons,
but
he
had
never
been
notified,
never
been
notified
of
what
the
state
director's
position
was.
now,
i
think
that
the
statements
of
the
fact
to
this
case
effectively
states
the
due
process
argument.
i
do
not
want
to
burden
the
court
with
reference
to
the
cases
which
we
have
briefed
which
we
feel
are
particularly
relevant
here.
i
think
this
case
can
be
dispose
of
on
the
merits,
that
is
substantive
merits,
by
referring
to
simmons
and
gonzales
and
where
general
cases
regarding
the
process
such
as
goldberg
against
kelly.
now,
we
come
to
the
procedural
question
which
is
of
some
importance.
it
is
our
view
that
given
the
new
statute
to
which
i
have
referred,
congress
has
enshrined
in
effect
the
constitutional
standard
which
we
have
always
argued
was
implicit,
implicit
in
the
1967
act
and
we
suggest
that
this
case
be
remanded
to
the
appeal
board
of
the
selective
service
system
who
are
processing
inconsistent
with
the
standards
which
we
now
know,
which
we
had
always
argued
what
constitutional
standards
but
which
congress
has
now
set
aside.
mr.
michael
b.
standard
well,
that
is
a
puzzle
your
honor,
i
cannot
pretend
since
the
act,
and
it
was
effective
on
september
28,
we
haven't
done
any
thorough
search,
but
i
can
refer
your
honor
to
two
cases,
where
apart
from
the
retroactivity
with
regard
to
other
selective
service
registrants
who
are
somewhere
in
the
process,
i
do
not
refer
to
them
at
all.
now,
with
regards
to
find,
it
has
been
and
this
court
reflected
in
u.s.
against
alabama
which
you'll
find
in
362
u.s.
and
in
ziffrin
against
the
united
states
which
you'll
find
in
318
that
where
there
is
a
change
in
the
law
between
the
court
of
original
jurisdiction
position
and
the
appeal
court’s
position
that
the
new
law
applies
and
we
suggest
that
it
applies
here.
mr.
michael
b.
standard
in
this
case
--
mr.
michael
b.
standard
--
it
applies
to
our
reply
in
this
petition
because
there
has
been
a
change
between
the
--
mr.
michael
b.
standard
that
is
correct.
i
take
no
position
because
i
do
not
pretend
to
have
briefed
the
question
of
retroactivity
for
others.
now,
should
this
court
find
that
the
new
statute
not
apply,
and
i
cannot
find
any
reason
why
you
might,
but
should
you
find
that
it
does
not
apply,
we
are
back
to
the
laws
which
this
court
in
oestereich
and
breen
placed
on
section
10
(b)
(3).
the
court
will
recall
that
in
those
two
cases,
one
case
of
ministerial
exemption,
one
case
of
student
deferment,
there
was
an
explicit
statutory
authorization
giving
both
of
those
classifications
and
the
local
board
as
this
court
have
found,
in
a
majority
of
this
court
found
in
an
excess
of
its
authority,
that
there
was
a
local
board
which
was
in
excess
of
its
authority,
reclassify
and
accelerated
deduction.
now,
if
we
are
back
to
the
old
problem
of
oestereich
and
breen
on
one
hand,
and
clark
versus
gabriel
on
the
other
hand,
i
understand
that
we
do
not
attack
classification
for
processing
here.
we
are
only
attacking
an
appellant
regulatory
scheme.
then
i
suggest,
this
is
clearly
within
the
oestereich
decision
by
statute,
when
a
local
board,
it
is
a
registrant
conscientious
objector
status
on
statute
that
is
final,
unless
an
appeal
is
authorized
by
rules
and
regulations
and
here
if
you
refer
back
to
that
appellant
regulatory
scheme,
you
will
find
no
authorization
except
the
generality,
which
describes
just
rules
and
regulations.
it
seems
to
me
in
a
case
which
transients
so
clearly
in
an
area
of
personal
liberty,
there
have
to
be
as
in
(inaudible)
against
dallas.
there
have
and
to
be
standards
which
are
explicit.
now,
congress
understands
that
quite
clearly
because
in
the
new
act,
it
does
not
merely
say,
there
is
a
right
to
appear
before
an
appeal
board
or
you
have
a
right
to
written
findings
or
written
reasons
rather.
what
it
says
is
pursuant
to
such
rules
and
regulations
as
the
president
may
prescribe
and
then
it
creates
the
standards,
but
nowhere
in
the
1967
act
are
there
any
standards
which
are
authorized
by
congress.
so
i
believe
that
we
are
in
a
classic
oestereich
situation
with
regard
to
the
burden
of
the
government’s
argument
which
has
been
that
there
really
is
burden
here
of
question
classification
of
processing.
i
notice
that
the
solicitor
general
finally
at
page
13
of
his
brief
agrees
that
this
court
supports
our
position.
it
says
this
court
is
not
now
called
upon
to
determine
whether
the
assigned
classification
is
wholly
without
factual
basis.
i
would
point
that
parenthetically
that
while
we
are
not
asking
the
court
to
deal
with
question
of
classification,
but
the
government
seems
to
suggest,
although
its
silent
as
to
reason
that
there
was
no
prima
facie
case
made
out
here
or
conscientious
objector
classification.
now,
maybe
there
is
something
that
i
do
not
know
about.
maybe,
although
it
does
not
appear
on
the
record,
the
record
is
silent
in
this
regard,
the
government
has
unequivocally
taken
the
position
that
there
was
no
statement
given
by
the
state
director
to
the
appeal
board.
if
that
is
so,
i
do
not
understand
how
it
can,
as
it
does
in
this
court,
can
test
the
validity
of
the
co
classification.
was
there
an
oral
communication
which
is
not
part
of
the
record,
we
do
not
know.
that
is
precisely
why
the
due
process
standards
we
are
urging
here
are
as
important
as
we
feel
they
are.
this
is
not,
however,
merely
a
case
of
prima
facie
classification.
here
we
had
a
local
board,
having
come
to
a
conclusion
that
a
registrant
was
classifiable
as
i-0.
i
would
suggest
the
court
that
it
either
do
one
of
two
things;
that
it
apply
the
new
public
law
92-129,
follow
the
standards
there
set
in,
refer
this
back
to
selective
service
system
for
review
in
light
of
those
standards,
that
pending
that
the
district
court
reinstate
finding
his
i-o
classification,
that
is
number
one.
alternatively,
although
the
relief
we
believe
should
be
the
same
that
it
apply
the
standards
that
it
has
recited
as
the
laws
in
oestereich
and
breen
to
10
(b)
(3)
of
the
act,
that
it
understand
that
we
attacking
a
system
of
classification,
not
classification
itself.
mr.
michael
b.
standard
yes
sir.
mr.
michael
b.
standard
yes,
but
i
confess
your
honor
because
of
the
newness
of
the
statute
that
while
i
had
begun
what
is
now
a
2000
case
search
to
canvass
both
the
senate
hearings
and
the
house
hearings,
i
find
only
two
references
and
in
going
through
the
senate.
the
only
testimony
which
explicitly
suggested
that
these
appellate
rights,
these
procedural
due
process
rights,
both
the
appeal
and
the
local
board
were
authored
by
mr.
(inaudible)
of
the
american
civil
liberties
union.
there
is
however
--
mr.
michael
b.
standard
no
certainly
not.
there
is,
however
–-
mr.
michael
b.
standard
that
is
true
and
i
do
not
pretend
that
the
search
has
ended
as
it
just
begun,
given
the
newness
of
the
statute
and
i
would
be
glad
if
the
court
desired
to
brief
that
and
ask
permission
to
do
so.
there
is
however,
in
the
91st
congress
first
session,
a
study
made
of
the
selective
service
system
with
recommendation
for
administrative
improvement.
that
was
submitted
by
the
administrative
practice
and
sub-committee
on
administrative
practice
and
procedure
to
the
senate
judiciary
committee
and
there
you
will
find
and
particularly
on
pages
or
it
would
be
the
section
running
9
through
11,
you
find
precisely
these
recommendations,
are
those
of
course
not
followed.
it
was
followed
by
the
conference
report
here
for
example.
one
of
the
issues
raised
was
the
right
to
counsel
at
the
local
board
appearance.
congress
in
a
conference
report
did
not
adopt
the
recommendations
for
administrative
improvement
made
in
the
study
i
have
just
referred
to,
but
rather
took
the
position
that
it
would
really
impede
the
selective
service
classification
process,
and
therefore,
did
not
adopt
that.
the
other
four
recommendations,
however,
of
the
senate
committee
were
adopted
at
the
conference.
mr.
michael
b.
standard
i
have
briefed
that
question,
your
honor.
i
will
be
glad
to
allude
to
it
briefly
in
the
following
ways.
first
there
was
a
classic
and
standard
answer,
there
has
been
an
allegation
in
this
complaint
of
damage
of
$10,000.00
amount
controversy
and
i
do
not
think
it
can
be
gain
set
by
anyone
or
is
it
that
this
petitioner
can
meet
that
statutory
requirement.
i
think
however
that
they
are
words
are
here,
a
constitutional
question
of
the
proportion,
if
this
action
had
been
begun
in
the
district
of
columbia,
it
would
be
$10,000.00
jurisdiction
on
that
as
congress
does
not
impose
that
amount.
in
the
district
unlike
every
other
district
in
the
united
states,
more
importantly
and
i
think
the
full
answer
is,
full
answer
i
choose
to
give
was
that
given
by
judge
angelstein
(ph)
in
dissent
below
in
the
three-judge
court
in
boyd
against
clark.
i
do
not
believe
you
can
exalt
a
19th
century
notion
of
property
in
cases
where
substantial
federal
rights
are
at
issue,
i
think
the
government
has
acknowledged
that
there
are
substantial
federal
rights
at
issue
here
and
i
do
not
think
that
1331
should
adhere
to
be
a
barred
against
the
jurisdiction.
mr.
michael
b.
standard
i
would
say
--
mr.
michael
b.
standard
well,
i
--
let
me
amend
that,
i
think
it
can.
i
think
it's
(inaudible)
when
it
does.
mr.
michael
b.
standard
do
i
recede
from
the
position
that
that
was
in
fact
what
occurred,
no,
your
honor,
not
at
all.
i
have
never
seen
that.
it
has
been
characterized
by
the
then
united
states
attorney
martin
solomon
as
merely
a
summary
prepared
by
the
clerk
to
enable
the
appeal
board
to
understand
what
the
issue
is.
you
will
find
his
affidavits,
i
believe
on
the
pages
following.
you
will
find
on
page
89
(i).
i
certainly
do
not
recede,
but
that
is
not
the
kind
of
notice
which
i
think
that
both
the
constitution
then
and
always
and
congress
now
requires.
mr.
michael
b.
standard
well,
what
had
happened
was
that
subsequent
to
the
argument
before
judge
tyler
in
this
case,
in
reviewing
the
record,
i
found
a
letter
which
was
dated
june
20th
from
--
which
was
then
from
the
clerk
of
the
local
board
to
the
appeal
board
and
it
said,
“please
be
advised
that
we
have
already
made
up
the
brief
on
the
above
named
subject
and
is
to
go
into
today’s
meeting.”
i,
therefore,
submitted
a
post
argument
that
is
post
the
argument
before
judge
tyler,
affidavit,
indicated
that
it
was
the
central
to
the
government’s
position,
but
that
nothing
else
had
happened
and
now
i
find
that
indeed
something
else
had
happened,
there
had
been
some
notification
and
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
in
response
then
said
that
there
was
nothing
which
was
meritorious,
something
which
went
to
the
substance
in
that
regard,
but
rather
was
merely
a
synopsis
by
the
clerk
to
the
appeal
board
in
this
process.
mr.
michael
b.
standard
no.
mr.
michael
b.
standard
no,
i
think
mr.
justice
blackmun,
you
have
misunderstood
if
you
thought
i
was
insinuating.
it
was
a
lawyer’s
brief,
by
i
used
the
phrase
brief
in
a
colloquial
sense,
that
is
it
was
a
synopsis,
a
play
stick
if
you
will,
of
what
was
going
to
be
presented
to
the
appeal
board.
it
was
prepared
by
a
non-lawyer,
a
clerk
not
by
anyone
of
the
state
director’s
office,
of
that
i
am
satisfied.
mr.
michael
b.
standard
no,
i
am
not
dissatisfied
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
b.
standard
that
would
have,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
michael
b.
standard
i
am
sorry.
mr.
michael
b.
standard
well,
i
think
if
it
were
a
listing
of
the
docket
entries
which
are
ordinarily
attached
to
the
coversheet
and
where
as
i
understand
appellate
practice,
that
would
never
occur.
i
think
it
would
have
been
referred
to
as
docket
entries,
but
i
think
the
use
of
english
language
is
simple.
i
mean,
when
the
word
“brief”
is
used
it
means
a
brief,
although
not
necessarily
in
a
lawyer
sense,
if
docket
entries
were
sent
up,
it
would
be
called
docket
entries.
mr.
michael
b.
standard
she
was
the
clerk
of
the
board
and
she
could
have
made
an
error.
the
record
is
silent
in
that
regard,
we
really
do
not
know.
