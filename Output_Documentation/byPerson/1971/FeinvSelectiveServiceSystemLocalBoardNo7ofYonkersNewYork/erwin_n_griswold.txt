mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
can
become
quite
complicated
and
i
am
going
to
try
if
i
can
to
present
it
in
a
somewhat
simple
form
insofar
as
there
is
a
constitutional
question
in
it.
it
seems
to
me
to
be
essentially
one
of
the
framework
within
which
this
court
sits,
that
is
the
separation
of
powers,
the
proper
function
of
this
court
with
respect
to
the
functions
of
specifically
congress
in
this
case.
the
case
i
believe
turns
on
the
application
of
two
relatively
simple
statutory
provisions
which
are
quoted
on
pages
2
and
3
of
our
brief.
first
is
the
jurisdictional
amount
provision
to
which
mr.
standard
referred
at
the
close
of
his
argument
and
which
is
discussed
at
the
close
of
our
brief.
the
district
court
shall
have
original
jurisdiction
of
all
civil
actions
wherein
the
matter
in
controversy
exceeds
the
sum
or
value
of
$10,000.00.
now,
there
is
not
trace
of
evidence
in
this
case
that
$10,000.00
or
any
other
amount
is
involved
and
the
argument
made
by
mr.
standard
in
his
brief
is
in
essence
that
that
provision
really
should
not
be
taken
seriously.
maybe
it
is
unconstitutional,
though
he
was
not
willing
to
say
that
it
was
unconstitutional
this
morning
that
at
any
rate
at
19th
century
anachronism
and
the
court
shouldn't
really
pay
much
attention
to
it.
now,
it
maybe
wise
or
maybe
unwise
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
is
an
allegation
in
the
pleading,
but
the
nature
of
the
transaction
is
such
that
it
is
not
susceptible
to
monetary
evaluation.
it
is
like
the
question
this
court
decided
a
century
ago
that
custody
of
a
child
which
can
be
a
crucially
important
matter
is
not
susceptible
of
monetary
evaluation
and
–-
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
two
years
of
military
pay
as
a
physician
is
considerably
higher
than
two
years
of
military
pay
as
a
first
class
private
and
this
man
would
have
gone
in
the
service
as
a
commissioned
officer
with
pay
and
allowances
and
besides
i
am
not
sure
that
is
the
proper
measure
–-
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
in
a
case
such
as
this.
i
merely
suggest
that
if
the
district
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction,
this
court
does
not
have
jurisdiction
and
there
is
something
to
be
said
for
not
giving
advisory
opinions
on
important
and
difficult
questions
of
constitutional
law
in
cases
in
which
the
jurisdiction
is
not
established.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
how
about
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
in
that
case,
the
majority
of
the
court
claimed,
(voice
overlap)
they
made
it
clear
that
it
was
not
proceeding
under
this
section
because
it
felt
that
the
jurisdictional
amount
could
not
be
there
and
it
found
a
way
to
proceed
under
another
section
which
is
not
available
here.
so
i
think
that
the
hague
case
rather
supports
the
position
i
am
taking.
i
would
not
want
to
be
misunderstood.
if
i
were
a
member
of
congress
which
i
am
not,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
provision
might
will
be
reconsidered
with
respect
to
cases
of
this
type,
but
it
is
what
congress
has
provided
and
congress
has
not
made
any
change
in
it
and
i
find
it
difficult
to
see
why
the
court
should
not
respect
it
and
carry
it
into
effect.
now,
the
other
statutory
provision
is
section
10
(b)
(3)
of
the
selective
service
act
which
has
been
before
this
court
in
a
number
of
cases
and
which
is
quoted
at
the
bottom
of
page
3
of
our
brief.
no
judicial
review
shall
be
made
of
the
classification
and
here
i
emphasize
the
next
two
words
“or
processing.”
mr.
standard
has
said
he
is
talking
about
the
procedures
used
here
and
i
suggest
that
“or
processing”
could
not
be
clearer
expression
of
the
intention
of
congress
that
the
procedures
shall
not
be
subject
to
judicial
review
of
any
registrant
by
local
board,
the
appeal
board
or
the
president
except
as
a
defense
to
criminal
prosecution
after
the
registrant
has
responded
either
affirmatively
or
negatively
to
an
order
to
report
for
induction.
the
question
in
this
case
it
seems
to
us
is
really
the
construction
and
application
of
section
10
(b)
(3)
and
let
me
point
out
too
that
the
ultimate
question
is
simply
one
of
timing.
if
mr.
standards
has
substantial
questions
to
raise
on
behalf
of
his
client,
we
do
not
contend
that
there
is
not
a
place
where
they
can
be
raised.
we
are
not
contending
that
these
questions
are
forever
foreclosed
from
judicial
review.
our
position
is
simply
that
they
cannot
consistently
with
the
enactment
by
congress,
an
enactment
properly
made
by
congress
in
its
judgment,
both
with
respect
to
its
power
to
control
the
procedures
in
the
lower
federal
courts
and
with
respect
to
its
powers
to
raise
and
maintain
armies.
that
congress
has
provided
that
no
judicial
review
shall
be
had
of
the
classification
or
processes
except
after
either
an
affirmative
or
negative
response
to
an
order
to
report
for
induction.
now
obviously
of
course
this
turns
on
several
cases
which
have
recently
been
before
the
court.
the
first
of
which
and
the
one
i
suppose
most
relied
on
by
mr.
standard
is
the
oestereich
case
and
i
would
point
out
that
that
case
is
markedly
different
from
this
case.
i
would
point
out
too
that
justice
stewart
wrote
a
dissenting
opinion
in
that
case
in
which
justices
brennan
and
white
concurred,
in
which
they
said
that
there
was
no
inherent
or
inevitable
conflict
between
the
statutory
provisions
which
were
before
the
court.
the
position
which
was
taken
by
the
government
there
was
that
10
(b)
(3)
said
no
judicial
review
shall
be
had,
but
there
was
another
provision
in
the
statute
which
said
the
students
of
theology
“shall
be
exempt
from
training
and
service
under
this
act.”
and
then
they
struggled
in
my
mind
which
went
on
in
connection
with
that
case,
i
found
those
two
provisions,
though
not
necessarily,
inherently
inconsistent,
so
close
to
inconsistent
that
i
found
it
impossible
to
support
the
literal
construction
of
section
10
(b)
(3)
in
that
situation.
the
then
director
of
the
selective
service
system
was
unhappy
about
that
and
he
may
well
have
been
more
farseeing
to
see
cases
such
as
this
over
the
horizon.
i
recognized
that
the
conflict
was
not
absolute
or
literal
as
was
pointed
out
by
mr.
justice
stewart’s
opinion,
but
i
ascertained
that
if
this
case
went
forward,
that
the
criminal
division
of
department
of
justice
would
not
institute
a
criminal
prosecution
against
the
man
where
the
statute
provided
that
he
shall
be
exempt
from
service
or
training
under
this
act.
it
was
perfectly
clear
in
my
mind
that
if
one,
if
such
a
prosecution
that
were
instituted
and
if
that
is
true
to
the
solicitor
general’s
office,
that
i
would
confess
there
in
such
case
and
i
had
little
doubt
with
the
court
would
support
such
a
confession
in
view
of
the
express
provision
of
the
statute.
and
referring
to
an
opinion
of
this
court
in
a
grab
case
some
20
years
ago
where
it
was
said
that
it
was
unnecessary
to
walk-up
the
hill
then
march
down
again.
i
felt
that
the
conflict
was
so
close
that
a
construction
of
section
10
(b)
(3)
was
called
upon
and
i
point
out
that
that
problem
arose
only
because
there
were
two
statutory
provisions,
at
least
nearly
in
conflict
with
each
other,
there
is
nothing
of
that
sort
here.
now,
that
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice,
the
only
substantive
amendment
in
the
draft
act
that
was
made
or
at
least
the
only
one
that
is
anywhere
near
that,
near
this
case
is
the
addition
of
section
22
at
end
which
contains
these
provisions
which
mr.
standard
referred
to
and
to
which
i
plan
to
make
a
reference
a
little
later
in
my
argument.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
10
(b)
(3)
is
an
unchanged.
it
is
entirely
unchanged,
no
reference
to
it
in
the
statute.
now
on
the
same
day,
that
oestereich
was
decided,
there
was
also
decided
clark
against
gabriel
which
it
seems
to
me
clearly
supports
the
position
that
i
have
taken
that
oestereich
turns
on
the
clash
on
the
presence
of
two
virtually
inconsistent
provisions,
shall
i
say
practically
inconsistent
provisions
with
respect,
that
i
fully
agree
they
were
not
literally
inconsistent,
that
i
felt
that
they
were
practically
so
and
the
majority
of
the
court
and
took
that
position.
clark
against
gabriel
involved
a
pre-induction
effort
to
enjoin
inductions
with
respect
to
a
claim
of
conscientious
objector
and
the
court
held
that
10
(b)
(3)
barred
that
position.
i
might
also
point
out
in
the
oestereich
case
itself,
mr.
justice
harlan
concurs
in
the
judgment
on
ground
which
are
very
close
to
the
position
of
mr.
standard
today.
i
think
perhaps
over
simplifying
it,
it
was
on
the
ground
that
if
it
was
a
question
of
fact,
there
couldn't
be
an
injunction,
but
if
there
was
a
question
of
law,
it
could
be.
but
that
view,
so
he
repeated
it
in
the
gutknecht
and
breen
or
particularly
the
breen
case,
was
not
adopted
by
any
other
member
of
the
court
and
then
the
case
which
i
think
is
the
closest
to
this
case,
was
decided
only
a
few
week
later
than
clark
against
gabriel
and
that
is
boyd
against
clark.
that
is
a
per
curiam
opinion
of
the
court,
two
to
three
lines
long,
bypassing
the
jurisdictional
amount
question,
but
otherwise
simply
affirming
the
judgment
of
the
court
below.
but
boyd
against
clark
was
a
pure
question
of
law.
there
was
a
question
and
it
was
suggested
there
for
enjoining
inductions
that
there
was
unconstitutional
discrimination
against
non-college
students
in
that
they
perhaps
because
of
inadequate
financial
support
were
subjected
to
the
draft
while
college
students
were
deferred.
that
contention
was
denied
by
a
three-judge
district
court
which
also
dismissed
for
want
of
jurisdiction
on
the
jurisdictional
amount
question.
an
appeal
was
taken
to
this
court
and
this
court
affirmed
per
curiam
without
reaching
the
question
under
section
1331
which
is
the
jurisdictional
amount
cases.
and
then
finally,
the
construction
of
10
(b)
(3)
which
i
am
urging
here,
it
seems
to
me
is
confirmed
by
the
breen
case
in
396
u.s.
both
the
oestereich
and
the
breen
case
grow
out
of
delinquency
reclassification.
oestereich
case
involved
a
statutory
provision
which
said
that
the
individual
shall
be
exempt.
breen
case
involved
a
situation
where
there
was
no
doubt,
no
contention
that
the
individual
was
a
bona
fide
full
time
student
and
the
statute
as
then
said,
then
read
that,
that
such
students
shall
be
deferred
and
the
contention
was
made
before
this
court
that
there
was
a
difference
between
a
deferral
and
in
exemption.
formally,
i
think
one
can
make
that
difference.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
the
court
of
appeals
not
in
the
breen
case,
yes,
mr.
justice
in
the
course
of
the
breen
case,
the
court
of
appeals
had
made
that
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
had
made
that
distinction.
i
find
it
little
confusing
to
put
gutknecht
and
breen
separate,
but
gutknecht
has
nothing
directly
to
do
with
this
because
it
was
a
criminal
case,
not
a
10
(b)
(3)
case
and
the
court
held
that
there
was
no
difference
between
an
express
statutory
provision
by
congress
that
oestereich
should
be
exempted
and
that
breen
could
be
deferred.
i
think
perhaps
some
of
the
trouble
in
latter
cases
as
come
from,
shall
i
say
somewhat
broad
language
in
the
oestereich
case.
the
lower
courts
have
at
sometimes
quoted
the
words
“blatantly
lawless”
from
the
oestereich
case
and
we
find
occasionally
that
anything
that
anybody
finds
that
he
can
argue
was
not
in
accordance
with
law
becomes
“blatantly
lawless”
in
order
that
it
can
be
brought
within
the
oestereich
case.
but
the
result
of
these
decisions
it
seems
to
me
is
that
section
10
(b)
(3)
means
what
it
says.
it
should
be
read
to
mean
what
it
says,
except
in
situations
where
the
court
finds
conflicting
provisions
in
the
enactments
of
congress.
such
conflicting
provisions
were
found
in
oestereich,
such
conflicting
provisions
were
found
in
breen.
they
were
not
found
in
clark
against
gabriel
where
the
issue
underlying
issue
was
one
of
the
facts.
they
were
not
found
in
boyd
against
clark
where
the
underlying
issue
is
one
of
laws
and
so
i
suggest
that
the
issue
in
this
case
has
in
fact
been
decided
by
this
court
in
boyd
against
clark.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
in
boyd
against
clark?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
was
the
question
with
respect
to
discrimination
against
non-student
with
economic
undertones
involved
in
it
which
is
a
question
of
due
process
and
equal
protection
which
is
not
unrelated
to
the
procedural
due
process
which
is
referred
to
as
hearing.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
under
the
new
statute
there
would.
i
hesitated
only
for
a
moment
because
the
president
has
nurtured
his
regulation
under
the
new
selective
service
system.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
mr.
justice,
i
have
not
had
any
chance
to
think
about
this
in
advance,
but
i
think
i
would.
i
think
i
would
say
that
it
was
barred
by
10
(b)
(3)
and
you
might
say
well,
why
isn't
this
also
a
case
of
inconsistent
statutory
provisions
and
i
think
i
would
say,
well,
this
is
a
--
the
inconsistency
here
relates
to
procedures,
to
the
processed
and
10
(b)
(3)
has
expressly
precluded.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
agree
mr.
justice
and
let
me
reiterate
that
we
are
not
suggesting
that
mr.
fein
cannot
present
his
issues
before
a
proper
court
at
a
proper
time,
in
a
completely
impartial
court
at
a
proper
time.
we
simply
say
that
10
(b)
(3)
says
that
it
cannot
present
it
now.
it
leaves
them
a
difficult
alternative,
i
agree,
but
that
is
the
–-
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
or
in
defense
of
a
criminal
prosecution
and
i
agree
that's
a
difficult
place,
but
it
is
a
full
day
in
court
before
an
impartial
judicial
tribunal.
these
provisions
in
the
statute
which
was
enacted
on
september
28th,
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
to
indicate
that
congress
intended
that
they
should
be
in
anyway
retroactive.
the
effective
date
of
the
statute
is
september
28th.
the
only
provision
which
varies
from
that
is
that
the
extension
of
the
draft
from
july
1,
1971
to
july
1,
1973
is
expressly
provided
to
take
effect
from
july
2,
1971.
apparently
july
1
was
included
in
the
previous
statute.
i
might
give
the
reference.
i
have
here
the
conference
report
which
is
report
number
92-432,
house
report
number
92-433,
these
amendments
were
made
in
the
senate.
they
were
not
included
in
the
house
of
bill
and
the
senate
included
a
fifth
provision
which
provided
for
counsel
before
the
draft
board.
the
conference
committee,
the
report
reads
after
extensive
discussion,
the
house
contraries
agreed
to
accept
the
senate
amendment
with
regard
to
items
1,
2,
3
and
4
and
items
1
and
4
are
the
ones
to
which
mr.
standard
refers.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
have
found
them
to
be
very
prompt,
but
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
have
not
tried
to
find
it
in

mr.
reynolds
found
it
for
me
with
a
considerable
amount
of
difficulty,
but
found
it.
the
senate
contraries
pointed
out
that
under
the
language
of
their
amendment,
these
rights
would
be
granted
pursuant
to
such
rules
and
regulations
as
the
president
may
prescribe
and
the
regulations
under
which
the
rights
were
granted
should
be
drafted
in
such
away
as
the
preclude
abuses
and
obvious
delay
in
taxes.
the
senate
contraries
pointed
out
further
that
the
right
to
present
witnesses
is
specifically
subject
under
their
amendment
to
reasonable
limitations
on
the
number
of
witnesses
and
the
total
time
allotted.
with
the
understanding,
therefore,
that
the
regulations
implementing
these
provisions
will
be
drafted
in
such
away
as
to
protect
the
orderly
and
the
efficient
functioning
of
the
selective
service
system
and
not
result
in
an
unreasonable
burden
on
local
draft
board,
the
house
accepted
the
senate
position
on
items
1
to
4
and
then
the
report
goes
to
say
that
the
senate
receded
from
its
position
was
respect
to
counsel
because
of
concern
about
two
things
that
it
would
impose
a
serious
procedural
burden
on
civilian
draft
boards
and
that
it
might
provide
inequity
in
that
some
people
with
economic
status
which
enable
them
to
have
to
counsel
or
more
effective
counsel
than
others
would
have.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
he
may
attach
--
the
person
appealing
may
attach
to
his
appeal.
in
this
case,
was
the
state
director
of
selective
service
who
appeared
and
we
agree
that
if
he
had
attached
a
statement
of
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
he
simply
sent
a
letter
to
the
court
saying
“i
appeal.”
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
without
proceeding
any
position
whatever
which
is
the
way
it
is
usually
done.
what
that
means
is
that
the
file
is
then
transmitted
to
the
appeal
board
and
the
appeal
board
treats
the
file
as
we
lawyers
would
say
as
trial
de
novo
and
considers
the
whole
thing
as
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
argument,
no
appearance
before
either
the
–-
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
statement
of
position.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
mr.
justice
i
am
afraid
i
cannot
accept
that
as
it
must
have
been
done
in
hundreds
of
thousands
of
cases
over
the
past
25
years
and
on
the
whole
it
has
worked
pretty
well.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
take
it
that
the
effect
of
the
appeal
does
indicate
that
somebody
thinks
that
it
ought
to
be
looked
into.
i
may
say
it
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
they
wanted
to
reverse
in
this
particular
case.
after
mystifying
laws
in
the
state
appeal
board,
he
lost
unanimously
and
under
the
regulation
he
had
no
right
to
appeal
to
the
presidential
board.
he
wrote
to
the
director
of
selective
service
and
the
director
selective
service
took
an
appeal
for
him.
i
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
director
of
selective
service
thought
that
it
ought
to
be
reversed.
he
apparently
thought
that
it
ought
to
be
reviewed
and
it
seems
to
me
entirely
appropriate
for
the
administrative
officer
and
say
to
the
tribunal
and
we
think
this
is
a
matter
which
ought
to
be
reviewed
without
putting
any
weight
as
to
which
way
it
ought
to
go
and
i
think
that
that
is
juxtaposition
here.
in
any
event,
it
is
a
part
of
the
procedure.
it
is
a
part
of
processing
of
the
registrant’s
case
and
that
is
precisely
what
section
10
(b)
(3)
says
that
it
should
not
be
subject
to
a
judicial
review
and
we
submit
that
is
in
effect
what
this
court
decided
in
boyd
against
clark
and
that
this
is
fully
consistent
with
the
court’s
decisions
in
oestereich
and
breen.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
can
become
quite
complicated
and
i
am
going
to
try
if
i
can
to
present
it
in
a
somewhat
simple
form
insofar
as
there
is
a
constitutional
question
in
it.
it
seems
to
me
to
be
essentially
one
of
the
framework
within
which
this
court
sits,
that
is
the
separation
of
powers,
the
proper
function
of
this
court
with
respect
to
the
functions
of
specifically
congress
in
this
case.
the
case
i
believe
turns
on
the
application
of
two
relatively
simple
statutory
provisions
which
are
quoted
on
pages
2
and
3
of
our
brief.
first
is
the
jurisdictional
amount
provision
to
which
mr.
standard
referred
at
the
close
of
his
argument
and
which
is
discussed
at
the
close
of
our
brief.
the
district
court
shall
have
original
jurisdiction
of
all
civil
actions
wherein
the
matter
in
controversy
exceeds
the
sum
or
value
of
$10,000.00.
now,
there
is
not
trace
of
evidence
in
this
case
that
$10,000.00
or
any
other
amount
is
involved
and
the
argument
made
by
mr.
standard
in
his
brief
is
in
essence
that
that
provision
really
should
not
be
taken
seriously.
maybe
it
is
unconstitutional,
though
he
was
not
willing
to
say
that
it
was
unconstitutional
this
morning
that
at
any
rate
at
19th
century
anachronism
and
the
court
shouldn't
really
pay
much
attention
to
it.
now,
it
maybe
wise
or
maybe
unwise
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
is
an
allegation
in
the
pleading,
but
the
nature
of
the
transaction
is
such
that
it
is
not
susceptible
to
monetary
evaluation.
it
is
like
the
question
this
court
decided
a
century
ago
that
custody
of
a
child
which
can
be
a
crucially
important
matter
is
not
susceptible
of
monetary
evaluation
and
–-
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
two
years
of
military
pay
as
a
physician
is
considerably
higher
than
two
years
of
military
pay
as
a
first
class
private
and
this
man
would
have
gone
in
the
service
as
a
commissioned
officer
with
pay
and
allowances
and
besides
i
am
not
sure
that
is
the
proper
measure
–-
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
in
a
case
such
as
this.
i
merely
suggest
that
if
the
district
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction,
this
court
does
not
have
jurisdiction
and
there
is
something
to
be
said
for
not
giving
advisory
opinions
on
important
and
difficult
questions
of
constitutional
law
in
cases
in
which
the
jurisdiction
is
not
established.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
how
about
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
in
that
case,
the
majority
of
the
court
claimed,
(voice
overlap)
they
made
it
clear
that
it
was
not
proceeding
under
this
section
because
it
felt
that
the
jurisdictional
amount
could
not
be
there
and
it
found
a
way
to
proceed
under
another
section
which
is
not
available
here.
so
i
think
that
the
hague
case
rather
supports
the
position
i
am
taking.
i
would
not
want
to
be
misunderstood.
if
i
were
a
member
of
congress
which
i
am
not,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
provision
might
will
be
reconsidered
with
respect
to
cases
of
this
type,
but
it
is
what
congress
has
provided
and
congress
has
not
made
any
change
in
it
and
i
find
it
difficult
to
see
why
the
court
should
not
respect
it
and
carry
it
into
effect.
now,
the
other
statutory
provision
is
section
10
(b)
(3)
of
the
selective
service
act
which
has
been
before
this
court
in
a
number
of
cases
and
which
is
quoted
at
the
bottom
of
page
3
of
our
brief.
no
judicial
review
shall
be
made
of
the
classification
and
here
i
emphasize
the
next
two
words
“or
processing.”
mr.
standard
has
said
he
is
talking
about
the
procedures
used
here
and
i
suggest
that
“or
processing”
could
not
be
clearer
expression
of
the
intention
of
congress
that
the
procedures
shall
not
be
subject
to
judicial
review
of
any
registrant
by
local
board,
the
appeal
board
or
the
president
except
as
a
defense
to
criminal
prosecution
after
the
registrant
has
responded
either
affirmatively
or
negatively
to
an
order
to
report
for
induction.
the
question
in
this
case
it
seems
to
us
is
really
the
construction
and
application
of
section
10
(b)
(3)
and
let
me
point
out
too
that
the
ultimate
question
is
simply
one
of
timing.
if
mr.
standards
has
substantial
questions
to
raise
on
behalf
of
his
client,
we
do
not
contend
that
there
is
not
a
place
where
they
can
be
raised.
we
are
not
contending
that
these
questions
are
forever
foreclosed
from
judicial
review.
our
position
is
simply
that
they
cannot
consistently
with
the
enactment
by
congress,
an
enactment
properly
made
by
congress
in
its
judgment,
both
with
respect
to
its
power
to
control
the
procedures
in
the
lower
federal
courts
and
with
respect
to
its
powers
to
raise
and
maintain
armies.
that
congress
has
provided
that
no
judicial
review
shall
be
had
of
the
classification
or
processes
except
after
either
an
affirmative
or
negative
response
to
an
order
to
report
for
induction.
now
obviously
of
course
this
turns
on
several
cases
which
have
recently
been
before
the
court.
the
first
of
which
and
the
one
i
suppose
most
relied
on
by
mr.
standard
is
the
oestereich
case
and
i
would
point
out
that
that
case
is
markedly
different
from
this
case.
i
would
point
out
too
that
justice
stewart
wrote
a
dissenting
opinion
in
that
case
in
which
justices
brennan
and
white
concurred,
in
which
they
said
that
there
was
no
inherent
or
inevitable
conflict
between
the
statutory
provisions
which
were
before
the
court.
the
position
which
was
taken
by
the
government
there
was
that
10
(b)
(3)
said
no
judicial
review
shall
be
had,
but
there
was
another
provision
in
the
statute
which
said
the
students
of
theology
“shall
be
exempt
from
training
and
service
under
this
act.”
and
then
they
struggled
in
my
mind
which
went
on
in
connection
with
that
case,
i
found
those
two
provisions,
though
not
necessarily,
inherently
inconsistent,
so
close
to
inconsistent
that
i
found
it
impossible
to
support
the
literal
construction
of
section
10
(b)
(3)
in
that
situation.
the
then
director
of
the
selective
service
system
was
unhappy
about
that
and
he
may
well
have
been
more
farseeing
to
see
cases
such
as
this
over
the
horizon.
i
recognized
that
the
conflict
was
not
absolute
or
literal
as
was
pointed
out
by
mr.
justice
stewart’s
opinion,
but
i
ascertained
that
if
this
case
went
forward,
that
the
criminal
division
of
department
of
justice
would
not
institute
a
criminal
prosecution
against
the
man
where
the
statute
provided
that
he
shall
be
exempt
from
service
or
training
under
this
act.
it
was
perfectly
clear
in
my
mind
that
if
one,
if
such
a
prosecution
that
were
instituted
and
if
that
is
true
to
the
solicitor
general’s
office,
that
i
would
confess
there
in
such
case
and
i
had
little
doubt
with
the
court
would
support
such
a
confession
in
view
of
the
express
provision
of
the
statute.
and
referring
to
an
opinion
of
this
court
in
a
grab
case
some
20
years
ago
where
it
was
said
that
it
was
unnecessary
to
walk-up
the
hill
then
march
down
again.
i
felt
that
the
conflict
was
so
close
that
a
construction
of
section
10
(b)
(3)
was
called
upon
and
i
point
out
that
that
problem
arose
only
because
there
were
two
statutory
provisions,
at
least
nearly
in
conflict
with
each
other,
there
is
nothing
of
that
sort
here.
now,
that
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice,
the
only
substantive
amendment
in
the
draft
act
that
was
made
or
at
least
the
only
one
that
is
anywhere
near
that,
near
this
case
is
the
addition
of
section
22
at
end
which
contains
these
provisions
which
mr.
standard
referred
to
and
to
which
i
plan
to
make
a
reference
a
little
later
in
my
argument.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
10
(b)
(3)
is
an
unchanged.
it
is
entirely
unchanged,
no
reference
to
it
in
the
statute.
now
on
the
same
day,
that
oestereich
was
decided,
there
was
also
decided
clark
against
gabriel
which
it
seems
to
me
clearly
supports
the
position
that
i
have
taken
that
oestereich
turns
on
the
clash
on
the
presence
of
two
virtually
inconsistent
provisions,
shall
i
say
practically
inconsistent
provisions
with
respect,
that
i
fully
agree
they
were
not
literally
inconsistent,
that
i
felt
that
they
were
practically
so
and
the
majority
of
the
court
and
took
that
position.
clark
against
gabriel
involved
a
pre-induction
effort
to
enjoin
inductions
with
respect
to
a
claim
of
conscientious
objector
and
the
court
held
that
10
(b)
(3)
barred
that
position.
i
might
also
point
out
in
the
oestereich
case
itself,
mr.
justice
harlan
concurs
in
the
judgment
on
ground
which
are
very
close
to
the
position
of
mr.
standard
today.
i
think
perhaps
over
simplifying
it,
it
was
on
the
ground
that
if
it
was
a
question
of
fact,
there
couldn't
be
an
injunction,
but
if
there
was
a
question
of
law,
it
could
be.
but
that
view,
so
he
repeated
it
in
the
gutknecht
and
breen
or
particularly
the
breen
case,
was
not
adopted
by
any
other
member
of
the
court
and
then
the
case
which
i
think
is
the
closest
to
this
case,
was
decided
only
a
few
week
later
than
clark
against
gabriel
and
that
is
boyd
against
clark.
that
is
a
per
curiam
opinion
of
the
court,
two
to
three
lines
long,
bypassing
the
jurisdictional
amount
question,
but
otherwise
simply
affirming
the
judgment
of
the
court
below.
but
boyd
against
clark
was
a
pure
question
of
law.
there
was
a
question
and
it
was
suggested
there
for
enjoining
inductions
that
there
was
unconstitutional
discrimination
against
non-college
students
in
that
they
perhaps
because
of
inadequate
financial
support
were
subjected
to
the
draft
while
college
students
were
deferred.
that
contention
was
denied
by
a
three-judge
district
court
which
also
dismissed
for
want
of
jurisdiction
on
the
jurisdictional
amount
question.
an
appeal
was
taken
to
this
court
and
this
court
affirmed
per
curiam
without
reaching
the
question
under
section
1331
which
is
the
jurisdictional
amount
cases.
and
then
finally,
the
construction
of
10
(b)
(3)
which
i
am
urging
here,
it
seems
to
me
is
confirmed
by
the
breen
case
in
396
u.s.
both
the
oestereich
and
the
breen
case
grow
out
of
delinquency
reclassification.
oestereich
case
involved
a
statutory
provision
which
said
that
the
individual
shall
be
exempt.
breen
case
involved
a
situation
where
there
was
no
doubt,
no
contention
that
the
individual
was
a
bona
fide
full
time
student
and
the
statute
as
then
said,
then
read
that,
that
such
students
shall
be
deferred
and
the
contention
was
made
before
this
court
that
there
was
a
difference
between
a
deferral
and
in
exemption.
formally,
i
think
one
can
make
that
difference.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
the
court
of
appeals
not
in
the
breen
case,
yes,
mr.
justice
in
the
course
of
the
breen
case,
the
court
of
appeals
had
made
that
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
had
made
that
distinction.
i
find
it
little
confusing
to
put
gutknecht
and
breen
separate,
but
gutknecht
has
nothing
directly
to
do
with
this
because
it
was
a
criminal
case,
not
a
10
(b)
(3)
case
and
the
court
held
that
there
was
no
difference
between
an
express
statutory
provision
by
congress
that
oestereich
should
be
exempted
and
that
breen
could
be
deferred.
i
think
perhaps
some
of
the
trouble
in
latter
cases
as
come
from,
shall
i
say
somewhat
broad
language
in
the
oestereich
case.
the
lower
courts
have
at
sometimes
quoted
the
words
“blatantly
lawless”
from
the
oestereich
case
and
we
find
occasionally
that
anything
that
anybody
finds
that
he
can
argue
was
not
in
accordance
with
law
becomes
“blatantly
lawless”
in
order
that
it
can
be
brought
within
the
oestereich
case.
but
the
result
of
these
decisions
it
seems
to
me
is
that
section
10
(b)
(3)
means
what
it
says.
it
should
be
read
to
mean
what
it
says,
except
in
situations
where
the
court
finds
conflicting
provisions
in
the
enactments
of
congress.
such
conflicting
provisions
were
found
in
oestereich,
such
conflicting
provisions
were
found
in
breen.
they
were
not
found
in
clark
against
gabriel
where
the
issue
underlying
issue
was
one
of
the
facts.
they
were
not
found
in
boyd
against
clark
where
the
underlying
issue
is
one
of
laws
and
so
i
suggest
that
the
issue
in
this
case
has
in
fact
been
decided
by
this
court
in
boyd
against
clark.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
in
boyd
against
clark?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
was
the
question
with
respect
to
discrimination
against
non-student
with
economic
undertones
involved
in
it
which
is
a
question
of
due
process
and
equal
protection
which
is
not
unrelated
to
the
procedural
due
process
which
is
referred
to
as
hearing.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
under
the
new
statute
there
would.
i
hesitated
only
for
a
moment
because
the
president
has
nurtured
his
regulation
under
the
new
selective
service
system.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
mr.
justice,
i
have
not
had
any
chance
to
think
about
this
in
advance,
but
i
think
i
would.
i
think
i
would
say
that
it
was
barred
by
10
(b)
(3)
and
you
might
say
well,
why
isn't
this
also
a
case
of
inconsistent
statutory
provisions
and
i
think
i
would
say,
well,
this
is
a
--
the
inconsistency
here
relates
to
procedures,
to
the
processed
and
10
(b)
(3)
has
expressly
precluded.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
agree
mr.
justice
and
let
me
reiterate
that
we
are
not
suggesting
that
mr.
fein
cannot
present
his
issues
before
a
proper
court
at
a
proper
time,
in
a
completely
impartial
court
at
a
proper
time.
we
simply
say
that
10
(b)
(3)
says
that
it
cannot
present
it
now.
it
leaves
them
a
difficult
alternative,
i
agree,
but
that
is
the
–-
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
or
in
defense
of
a
criminal
prosecution
and
i
agree
that's
a
difficult
place,
but
it
is
a
full
day
in
court
before
an
impartial
judicial
tribunal.
these
provisions
in
the
statute
which
was
enacted
on
september
28th,
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
to
indicate
that
congress
intended
that
they
should
be
in
anyway
retroactive.
the
effective
date
of
the
statute
is
september
28th.
the
only
provision
which
varies
from
that
is
that
the
extension
of
the
draft
from
july
1,
1971
to
july
1,
1973
is
expressly
provided
to
take
effect
from
july
2,
1971.
apparently
july
1
was
included
in
the
previous
statute.
i
might
give
the
reference.
i
have
here
the
conference
report
which
is
report
number
92-432,
house
report
number
92-433,
these
amendments
were
made
in
the
senate.
they
were
not
included
in
the
house
of
bill
and
the
senate
included
a
fifth
provision
which
provided
for
counsel
before
the
draft
board.
the
conference
committee,
the
report
reads
after
extensive
discussion,
the
house
contraries
agreed
to
accept
the
senate
amendment
with
regard
to
items
1,
2,
3
and
4
and
items
1
and
4
are
the
ones
to
which
mr.
standard
refers.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
have
found
them
to
be
very
prompt,
but
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
have
not
tried
to
find
it
in
your
library.
mr.
reynolds
found
it
for
me
with
a
considerable
amount
of
difficulty,
but
found
it.
the
senate
contraries
pointed
out
that
under
the
language
of
their
amendment,
these
rights
would
be
granted
pursuant
to
such
rules
and
regulations
as
the
president
may
prescribe
and
the
regulations
under
which
the
rights
were
granted
should
be
drafted
in
such
away
as
the
preclude
abuses
and
obvious
delay
in
taxes.
the
senate
contraries
pointed
out
further
that
the
right
to
present
witnesses
is
specifically
subject
under
their
amendment
to
reasonable
limitations
on
the
number
of
witnesses
and
the
total
time
allotted.
with
the
understanding,
therefore,
that
the
regulations
implementing
these
provisions
will
be
drafted
in
such
away
as
to
protect
the
orderly
and
the
efficient
functioning
of
the
selective
service
system
and
not
result
in
an
unreasonable
burden
on
local
draft
board,
the
house
accepted
the
senate
position
on
items
1
to
4
and
then
the
report
goes
to
say
that
the
senate
receded
from
its
position
was
respect
to
counsel
because
of
concern
about
two
things
that
it
would
impose
a
serious
procedural
burden
on
civilian
draft
boards
and
that
it
might
provide
inequity
in
that
some
people
with
economic
status
which
enable
them
to
have
to
counsel
or
more
effective
counsel
than
others
would
have.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
he
may
attach
--
the
person
appealing
may
attach
to
his
appeal.
in
this
case,
was
the
state
director
of
selective
service
who
appeared
and
we
agree
that
if
he
had
attached
a
statement
of
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
he
simply
sent
a
letter
to
the
court
saying
“i
appeal.”
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
without
proceeding
any
position
whatever
which
is
the
way
it
is
usually
done.
what
that
means
is
that
the
file
is
then
transmitted
to
the
appeal
board
and
the
appeal
board
treats
the
file
as
we
lawyers
would
say
as
trial
de
novo
and
considers
the
whole
thing
as
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
argument,
no
appearance
before
either
the
–-
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
statement
of
position.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
mr.
justice
i
am
afraid
i
cannot
accept
that
as
it
must
have
been
done
in
hundreds
of
thousands
of
cases
over
the
past
25
years
and
on
the
whole
it
has
worked
pretty
well.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
take
it
that
the
effect
of
the
appeal
does
indicate
that
somebody
thinks
that
it
ought
to
be
looked
into.
i
may
say
it
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
they
wanted
to
reverse
in
this
particular
case.
after
mystifying
laws
in
the
state
appeal
board,
he
lost
unanimously
and
under
the
regulation
he
had
no
right
to
appeal
to
the
presidential
board.
he
wrote
to
the
director
of
selective
service
and
the
director
selective
service
took
an
appeal
for
him.
i
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
director
of
selective
service
thought
that
it
ought
to
be
reversed.
he
apparently
thought
that
it
ought
to
be
reviewed
and
it
seems
to
me
entirely
appropriate
for
the
administrative
officer
and
say
to
the
tribunal
and
we
think
this
is
a
matter
which
ought
to
be
reviewed
without
putting
any
weight
as
to
which
way
it
ought
to
go
and
i
think
that
that
is
juxtaposition
here.
in
any
event,
it
is
a
part
of
the
procedure.
it
is
a
part
of
processing
of
the
registrant’s
case
and
that
is
precisely
what
section
10
(b)
(3)
says
that
it
should
not
be
subject
to
a
judicial
review
and
we
submit
that
is
in
effect
what
this
court
decided
in
boyd
against
clark
and
that
this
is
fully
consistent
with
the
court’s
decisions
in
oestereich
and
breen.
