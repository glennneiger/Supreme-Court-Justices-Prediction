mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
constitutionality
of
ohio
revised
code
section
3517.07
which
imposes
political
tests
on
access
to
the
ballot
in
ohio.
the
statute
is
set
out
in
the
appendix
in
pages
12
through
13.
but
it
precludes
from
the
ballot
in
ohio
elections,
and
if
i
may
quote
briefly
from
the
statute,
“any
political
party
or
group
which
advocates,
either
directly
or
indirectly,
the
overthrow,
by
force
or
violence,
of
our
local
state
or
national
government
or
which
carries
on
a
program
of
sedition
or
treason
by
radio,
speech
or
press
or
which
has
in
any
manner,
any
connection
with
any
foreign
government
or
power
or
which
in
manner
has
any
connection
with
any
group
or
organization
so
connected
or
so
advocating
the
overthrow
by
force
or
violence
of
these
various
governments.
exempted
from
this
requirement
of
the
statute,
that
the
party
to
get
on
the
ballot
actually
meet
these
tests,
are
parties
and
groups
that
have
a
place
on
the
ballot
in
each
national
and
gubernatorial
election
in
ohio
since
1900.
those
two
parties
--
there
are
only
two
parties
that
meet
that
tests.
of
course,
those
are
the
democratic
and
republican
parties.
under
the
statute
to
secure
a
ballot
position
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
of
course
not,
your
honor.
i
am
implying
an
argument
that
i’ll
get
to
some
what
later
which
is
an
equal
protection
argument
that
by
exempting
any
parties
from
this
requirement,
the
state
is
drawing
invidious
classification.
and
i
will
come
to
that
argument
if
i
may,
your
honor.
but
under
the
statute,
parties
that
do
have
to
meet
this
test
in
fact
have
to
submit
an
affidavit
signed
by
10
members
of
the
party
or
group,
three
of
whom
are
to
be
executive
officers
of
the
party.
after
the
affidavit
in
the
form
of
the
statute
is
executed
and
filed
to
the
secretary
of
state.
the
secretary
of
state
is
required
to
conduct
his
own
investigation
of
the
facts
appearing
on
the
affidavit
and
to
make
his
own
determination
of
whether
the
party
or
group
should
be
on
the
ballot.
now
the
plaintiffs
brought
suit
in
1970,
challenging
this
provision
as
well
as
any
number
of
other
ohio
provisions,
but
those
provisions
which
were
in
the
litigation
have
all
been
washout
of
this
suit
by
subsequent
action
of
the
legislature
of
ohio.
we
sought
an
injunctive
and
declaratory
relief
from
a
prejudge
statutory
court
and
on
may
5,
1970,
the
district
court
declared
the
provision,
the
statute
of
ohio
unconstitutional
on
its
face,
but
reading
the
controlling
and
only
decision
of
the
ohio
supreme
court
on
the
statute,
the
state
ex
rel.
beck
v.
hummel
case,
excuse
me,
to
narrow
the
statute.
the
court
upheld
the
statute
as
construed
and
thus
the
court
held
that
the
statute
now
means
and
this
is
quote
in
the
appendix
of
page
62,
that
an
oath
is
required
that;
one,
the
party
is
not
engaged
in
an
attempt
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
or
violence.
two,
the
party
does
not
carry
on
a
program
of
sedition
or
treason
as
defined
by
criminal
law.
and
three,
the
party
is
not
knowingly
associated
with
a
group
attempting
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
or
violence.
plaintiffs
appealed
from
the
denial
of
their
injunction
upholding
the
statute
is
construed,
defendants
have
cross
appealed
from
so
much
of
the
decision
of
the
three-judge
district
court
holding
the
statute
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
plaintiffs
request
this
court
to
reverse
and
remand
with
directions
to
the
district
court
to
declare
entire
statute
unconstitutional
and
to
enjoin
its
enforcement
in
the
future.
there
are
several
reasons
why
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
some
of
these
reasons
go
to
the
statute
on
its
face,
some
go
to
the
statute
as
construed
and
interpreted
by
the
district
court
with
the
assistance
in
ohio
supreme
court
and
some
relate
to
both.
it’s
the
position
of
plaintiffs
that
the
starting
point
for
analysis
of
this
statute
is
an
appreciation
of
the
importance
of
the
right
to
vote
and
to
gain
access
to
the
ballot.
this
court
in
numerous
decisions
over
the
last
decades
has
held
for
example
as
in
wesberry
versus
sanders,
that
no
right
is
more
precious
in
a
free
country
than
not
of
having
a
voice
in
the
election
of
those
who
make
the
laws
unto
which
its
good
citizens
we
must
live.
other
rights
even
the
most
basic
are
elusory
if
the
right
to
vote
is
undermined.
it
is
our
first
position
in
this
case,
your
honors
that
there
is
an
absolute
right
on
the
part
of
the
electorate
to
vote
for
candidates
for
public
office
without
the
state
interposing
any
kind
of
a
screen
between
that
right
to
vote
and
access
to
the
ballot.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes,
it
was
your
honor.
it
was
a
three-judge
court.
you
recall
the
case
did
come
up
as
one
of
two
consolidating
cases
involving
a
broad
gauge
attack
to
a
number
of
ohio
election
provisions,
and
as
i
suggested,
most
of
those
provisions
have
been
mooted
out
of
the
case
by
a
legislative
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
right.
and
this
is
the
only
provision
that
appears
to
remain.
okay,
we
think
that
there
is
a
very
substantial,
first
amendment
component
to
the
right
to
vote.
we
believe
that
this
court
has
recognized
that
substantial
first
amendment
component.
in
the
predecessor
to
this
case,
williams
versus
rhodes
for
example,
the
decision
by
justice
black
on
equal
protection
grounds
started
of
from
an
appreciation
of
the
fact
the
right
of
individuals
to
associate
for
advancement
of
political
beliefs
and
the
right
of
qualified
voters
regardless
of
their
political
persuasion
to
cast
there
votes
effectively
is
a
fundamental
right
and
was
the
issue
involved
in
that
particular
case
and
indeed
remains
the
issue
in
this
case.
for
our
first
position
on
this
law
is
that
ohio
has
no
right
to
interpose
any
kind
of
a
political
test
for
the
vote
itself
and
for
access
to
the
ballot.
the
question
of
what
ohio
may
do
in
terms
of
qualifying
elected
officials
when
it
comes
time
for
them
to
take
their
oath
of
office
is
not
a
question
before
this
court,
we
don’t
even
act
that
point.
so
we
would
submit
that
not
even
the
oath
of
office
contemplated
in
article
6
of
the
constitution
in
the
united
states
is
appropriate.
now,
on
the
other
hand,
should
the
court
be
reticent
about
taking
this
particular
step
in
this
case.
our
second
position
is,
that
article
6
of
the
constitution
which
provides
for
a
constitutional
oath
of
office
for
elected
officials
in
the
united
states
read
together
with
amendment
number
1
has
to
mean
that
at
most
in
terms
of
political
credentials,
speech
and
association
credentials
of
candidates
for
public
office,
parties
on
about,
all
that
can
be
required
is
a
test
basically
in
the
form
of
in
article
6
affidavit
or
oath
of
office.
we
believe
that
this,
although
is
not
the
holding
of
the
court
in
the
case
of
bond
versus
floyd
involving
access
to
the
legislature
in
the
state
of
georgia
and
it
is
not
of
course
the
holding
of
the
case
in
this
court’s
decisions
in
powell
versus
mccormack
involving
the
court’s
ability
to
review
a
determination
by
the
congress
that
a
member
should
be
refused
his
sit
and
holding
that
the
house
is
limited
in
its
consideration
only
to
those
constitutional
requisites
which
the
member
must
meet
and
which
are
set
forth.
these
two
decisions
do
imply
very
strongly
at
the
most
that
the
state
may
require
the
article
6
kind
of
test.
we
would
refer
the
court
as
well
to
a
number
of
state
court
decisions,
the
leading
one
of
which
--
although
dealing
with
state
constitutional
law
is
imbrie
versus
marsh.
it
is
not
cited
in
brief
unfortunately,
it
is
a
decision
of
chief
justice
vanderbilt
of
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
and
its
reference
is
71
atlantic
second
352,
three
new
jersey
578,
in
which
chief
justice
vanderbilt
faced
with
a
state
law
of
new
jersey
which
added
to
the
qualifications
for
ballot
access
and
for
office
as
an
elected
official,
things
that
were
not
contemplated
in
the
constitutional
oath
provided
under
federal
and
state
constitution.
the
court
ruled
quite
clearly
that
the
constitutional
oath
requirement
brooked
no
additions,
whatsoever.
on
this
point,
the
court
might
also
refer
to
shub
v.
simpson
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
decision,
although
it
disavowed
the
imbrie
case
so
far
as
state
offices
are
concerned,
it
clearly
accepted
the
imbrie
rationale
on
a
preemption
basis
so
far
as
federal
elected
officers
are
concerned.
now,
in
addition
to
our
first
two
points,
we
have
a
number
which
are
perhaps
more
fully
briefed
in
our
brief.
the
third
point
on
constitutionality
of
this
ohio
provision
pertains
to
the
statutes
invasion
of
the
right
to
political
association.
the
statute
does
not
even
screen
candidates
as
such.
it
is
not
a
requirement
that
a
candidate
execute
an
oath
which
was
precisely
the
question
before
this
court
in
the
guinn
case
of
which
the
district
court
below
made
much.
that’s
not
the
case,
the
question
in
this
case.
what
we
have
here
is
a
statute
which
presumes
to
screen
political
congeries,
associations,
groups
and
parties
and
to
keep
them
off
of
the
ballot.
we
will
submit
the
cases
like
gibson
v.
florida
legislative
investigation
committee
and
naacp
v.
alabama
would
suggest
that
such
a
statute
is
at
least
constitutionally
presumptively
unconstitutional.
in
addition,
since
the
statute
requires
that
10
members
of
the
party
whether
candidates
or
not,
only
three
of
whom
are
to
the
offices
of
the
party
must
execute
the
affidavit,
there
is
a
direct
invasion
of
the
associational
rights
of
those
individuals
as
indicated
in
the
shelton
and
bates
decisions
and
the
decisions
involving
the
subversive
activities
control
act
and
the
registration
requirements
for
communist
action
organizations,
albertson
v.
cp
and
the
like.
this
statute
in
addition
is
unconstitutionally
overbroad.
it
is
perfectly
clear
the
statute
on
its
face
if
all
the
court
had
before
was
the
statutory
language
is
unconstitutionally
broad.
with
fully
briefed
that
point
and
i
won’t
go
over
the
statute
on
its
face
in
terms
of
the
overbreadth.
the
state
does
suggest
that
the
statute
is
still
constitutional
on
its
face,
but
the
district
court
below
certainly
held
to
the
contrary.
we
submit
that
even
as
construed
by
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
in
the
beck
case,
the
statute
is
unconstitutionally
broad
and
indeed
the
district
court
below
misread
the
supreme
court
of
ohio’s
decision.
it
is
our
position
that
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
in
narrowing
the
statute
only
narrowed
it
to
the
point
of
drawing
a
distinction
between
violence
or
engaging
in
violence,
but
including
in
that
category
mere
advocacy
of
violence
or
violent
overthrow,
and
on
the
other
hand,
peaceable
change
as
through
use
of
the
amendment
process.
a
careful
reading
of
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
i
think,
will
make
that
clear.
in
addition,
i
think
that
although
there
are
no
other
ohio
supreme
court
decisions
on
point,
there
are
a
number
of
ohio
lower
court
decisions
dealing
with
analogous
statutes
which
seemed
to
indicate
as
well
that
their
understanding
of
the
law
in
ohio
was
--
that
the
distinction
being
drawn
is
between
violence
including
mere
advocacy
and
peaceable
change.
even
as
construed
as
interpreted
by
the
district
court
below,
however,
the
statue
remains
unconstitutionally
broad.
again,
to
a
large
extent,
this
point
has
taken
up
in
our
argument
i
just
mentioned
the
two
most
notable
aspects
of
the
overbreadth
statute
as
construed
by
the
district
court.
fourth,
the
district
court
in
its
narrowing
construction
of
statutes
speaks
of
the
party
knowingly
associated
or
associating
with
a
group
attempting
to
overthrow
government
by
force
or
violence.
we
submit
that
the
use
of
the
term
knowingly
associated
is
two-open
ended
even
though
this
term
itself
two-open
ended,
in
addition,
we
submit
that
this
criterion
established
by
the
district
court
does
not
take
account
of
numerous
decisions
of
this
court
which
hold
that
mere
knowing
association
membership
in
or
participation
in
a
group
which
is
engaged
in
or
advocating
violent
overthrow
is
not
enough.
there
must
be
specific
intent
on
the
part
of
the
person
or
in
this
case
party
associating
to
further
or
fulfill
the
unlawful
goals
of
the
organization
which
is
engaged
in
the
unlawful
act
or
advocacy.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
we
don’t
extend
the
overbreadth
argument
to
such.
i
do
extend
the
next
point
which
of
course
is
a
vagueness
point
to
points
one
and
two.
i
must
say
to
the
extent
that
i
understand
what
number
one
means,
the
party
is
not
engaged
in
an
attempt
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
or
violence.
it
would
be
difficult
for
us
to
argue
that
that
is
overbroad,
assuming
that
this
inquiry
can
be
made
or
this
investigation
can
be
made
and
we
do
not
conceive
that.
it
seems
a
silly
thing
to
ask
somebody
to
make
an
affidavit
about
since
it
is
speaking
of
the
immediate
present
and
this
instant
and
has
no
reference
to
future
behavior
activity,
but
i
suppose
we
couldn’t
say
it
is
overbroad
if
anything,
it
is
incredibly
narrow.
however,
we
do
think
that
there
may
be
some
vagaries
involved
in
that
particular
language.
excuse
me.
less
in
a
point
one,
except
this
red
with
the
statute
itself
than
in
the
point
two,
the
party
does
not
carry
on
a
program
of
sedition
or
treason
as
defined
by
the
criminal
law.
well,
i
supposed
we
know
what
treason
means
under
the
criminal
law.
i
assume,
and
i
think
the
court
would
assume
that
treason
would
be
limited
by
article
3
of
the
constitution
to
mean
making
war
on
the
united
states
or
any
of
them
or
adhering
to
their
enemies
proven
according
to
the
two-witness
rule
or
open
confession.
and
indeed,
i
believe
there
is
an
ohio
statute
on
treason
though
i
don’t
know
that
it
has
ever
been
enforced.
however,
there
is
no
sedition
law
in
ohio.
the
closes
thing
to
a
sedition
law
in
ohio
was
the
criminal
syndicalism
act
which
this
court
declared
was
unconstitutional
in
brandenburg
versus
ohio.
there
is
no
referent
in
ohio
jurisprudence
at
all
for
meaning
for
the
term
sedition
and
of
course
this
court
has
recognized
–
i’ve
had
the
reference
to
your
language
mr.
justice
brennan
on
the
difficulty
the
court
has
with
you,
so
those
two
words,
sedition
and
treason
and
the
difficulty
of
the
defining
them.
but
that
is
quoted
in
the
brief
and
we
would
rest
on
that
proposition
so
far
as
the
construction
by
the
district
court
is
concerned,
these
are
the
primary
vague
provisions
in
this
newly
construed
statute.
but
again,
we
do
not
agree
that
the
district
court
was
correct
in
its
construction
in
light
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio’s
view.
we
think
it’s
perfectly
clear
further
that
the
vagueness
that’s
found
on
the
statute
and
the
overbreadth
is
incredibly
magnified
by
the
deprivations
of
due
process
of
law
in
a
procedural
sense
that
are
found
in
the
statute.
first
is
a
burden
of
going
forward
which
is
placed
immediately
upon
the
party.
the
statute
requires
that
an
affidavit
be
submitted
on
behalf
of
the
political
party
or
group.
it
seems
to
us
that
that
kind
of
a
requirement
is
interdicted
by
this
court’s
decision
in
speiser
versus
randall,
once
you’re
in
the
first
amendment
area.
further,
the
affidavit
isn’t
enough.
it
is
not
even
presumptively
dispositive
of
the
facts
of
not
being
subversive
or
not
fitting
within
the
statute.
the
statute
provides
that
the
secretary
of
state
shall
undertake
an
independent
investigation,
and
the
evidence
of
the
kind
of
an
investigation
the
secretary
of
state
is
likely
to
conduct
is
presented
in
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
in
the
beck
v.
hummel
case.
it
was
cursory
and
anti
first
amendment
at
best.
and
so
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
itself
found
in
that
particular
case.
in
the
course
of
the
investigation,
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
ruled
that
the
secretary
of
state
need,
provide
no
hearing,
none
whatsoever,
he
can
do
his
own
ex
parte
investigation.
clear
offense
to
procedural
due
process
and
further,
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
ruled
that
once
he
made
his
findings
and
certified
that
the
party
or
group
should
not
have
access
to
the
ballot,
it
should
not
be
placed
upon
the
ballot.
the
supreme
court
ruled
they
would
review,
they
and
the
other
ohio
courts
review
according
to
a
test
of
substantial
evidence.
whether
there
is
substantial
evidence,
i
assume
the
court
meant
on
the
record
as
a
whole
to
support
the
decision
of
the
secretary
of
state,
although
the
test
may
not
be
even
as
generous
to
the
party
or
group
as
a
substantial
evidence
rule
because
the
court
also
speaks
about
reviewing
according
to
a
determination
whether
will
overrule
the
secretary
of
state,
only
if
his
finding
is
manifestly
against
the
weight
of
the
evidence.
much
too
stringent
and
evidentiary
test
onto
this
court’s
decisions
in
speiser
versus
randall,
kernel
versus
hagen
buffin,
and
law
students
association
versus
wadmond,
so
again,
another
constitutional
infirmity
in
the
scheme.
and
finally,
to
return
to
the
point
that
justice
stewart
brought
out
in
his
question.
we
think
all
of
these
defects
are
further
magnified
by
the
fact
that
there
is
an
exemption
for
parties
with
a
great
deal
of
continuous
longevity
on
the
ballot
in
the
state
of
ohio,
those
two
parties
of
course
being
the
democrats
and
republicans.
we
do
not
imply
at
this
time
that
either
of
those
parties
would
have
difficulty
securing
the
ballot
position
under
the
test
of
this
statute
even
as
construed
assumingly
quite
understand
what
they
are.
what
we
do
mean
to
imply
is
your
observation
justice
stewart
in
jenness
versus
fortson
where
you
said
time
after
time,
established
political
parties
at
local
state
and
national
levels
has
while
maintaining
their
old
labels,
change
the
ideological
direction
because
of
influence
and
leadership
of
those
with
unorthodox
or
“radical”
views.
the
history
of
this
united
states
is
replete
with
examples
of
changes
of
ideological
direction
on
the
part
of
political
parties
in
the
united
states.
i
just
reviewed
a
document
that
had
been
prepared
by
the
former
secretary
of
state
of
ohio
on
the
election
experience
in
ohio
over
a
long
period
of
time
from
the
beginning
of
the
republic
to
the
present.
i
counted
37
separate
political
parties
of
whom
i
know
at
least
10
engaged
in
one
type
of
metamorphosis
or
another
of
which
several
were
more
or
less
revolutionary
for
their
time
including
the
evolutionist
part.
presumably
that
party
might
not
be
able
to
secure
ballot
position
in
ohio
today
if
it
attempted
to
go
on
the
ballot.
on
the
basis
of
this
various
defects,
it
is
the
appellants’
position
that
the
decision
of
the
court
below
should
be
reversed,
the
case
remanded
and
with
instructions
to
enjoin
the
operation
of
statute.
i
would
like
to
reserve
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
if
i
may
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
your
honor,
i
cannot
honestly
say,
i
have
not
seen
those
affidavits
in
a
while
myself
and
i
do
not
recall
what
they
are
in
the
file
but
your
question,
it
seems
to
me
is
a
broader
question
addressed
to,
precisely
the
consideration
that
mr.
justice
stewart
was
raising
and
that
was
the
first
point
that
i
did
wished
to
make
on
rebuttal.
and
that
is,
how
was
the
issue
raised
and
why
is
it
in
such
a
rather
thin
status?
it
may
well
be
that
the
affidavit
still
allege
additional
harm.
the
issue
was
raised
in
the
following
form,
your
honors.
the
complaint
was
filed
on
january
28,
1970.
now,
for
complaint
to
be
filed
on
that
day,
it
was
impossible
under
the
statute
for
my
clients
to
execute
the
affidavit.
the
statute
provides
that
the
affidavit
must
be
filed
with
the
secretary
of
state
between
nine
months
prior
to
the
next
election
and
six
months
prior
to
the
next
election.
conceivably,
they
might
have
waited
a
few
more
weeks
to
actually
submit
the
affidavit
or
to
make
a
request
for
consideration
on
the
ballot,
for
placement
on
the
ballot,
without
an
affidavit
or
they
might
have
try
to
fulfill
all
other
requirements
for
inclusion
on
the
ballot
without
an
affidavit
but
you
have
to
recall
this
case
has
a
history.
that
case
has
been
before
this
court
once,
twice,
the
ohio
election
laws
have
been
before
this
court.
this
is
the
third
time
there
was
a
small
portion
that
the
ohio
election
law
has
dealt
within
the
zepalady
case,
i
believe,
which
this
court
did
resolved
in
summary
fashion
earlier
this
term,
and
of
course
williams
versus
rhodes.
and
my
clients,
reading
williams
versus
rhodes,
and
being
cognizant
of
the
fact
that
they
were
denied,
injunctive
relief
by
you,
mr.
justice
stewart,
and
then
confirmed
by
the
court
in
william
versus
rhodes
for
failure
to
prosecute
their
cause
of
action
quickly,
can
hardly
be
faulted
for
moving
at
the
earliest
possible
opportunity
to
challenge
as
many
as
the
provisions
of
the
interconnected,
into
tangled
web
of
ohio
election
laws
which
they
believe
were
inhibiting
their
ability
to
get
ballot
position.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
now,
on
an
oath
type-provision,
it
has
not
been
the
understanding
of
this
court
that
there
is
any
requirement
that
efforts
be
made
to
comply
with
the
oath
requirement
first.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well,
but
you
see
as
the
case
was
formulated,
this
was
one
of
ten
provisions
engaged
in
two
separate
lawsuits
that
were
consolidated
in
order
to
try
to
bring
to
an
end
the
questions
over
the
ohio
elections
laws,
our
clients,
decided
to
go
in
one
lawsuit
and
to
bring
all
of
their
challenges
at
once.
it
doesn’t
seem
to
me
possible
that
they
could
have
attempted
to
comply
by
registration
requirements.
they
could
not
register
because
they
did
not
have
the
requisite
number
of
signatures
at
that
point.
they
weren’t
in
the
position
yet
to
attempt
to
certify
that
they
wanted
to
have
a
primary
yet.
they
were
challenging
the
primary
provisions.
they
were
challenging
an
entire
range
of
provisions.
some
of
which
had
some
bearing
on
the
rightness,
with
the
pure
rightness
of
the
way
in,
which
the
affidavit
provision
might
be
dealt
with.
now,
in
order
to
bring
their
challenge
to
the
affidavit
provision
early
enough
to
get
complete
relief
before
the
1970
election,
they
have
to
bring
it
all
in
one
lawsuit,
and
it
seems
to
me
that’s
the
reason
why
there
wasn’t
a
kind
of
pleading
that
justice
stewart
was
alluding
to,
which
would
focus
on
the
specific
harm
of
this
kind
of
an
affidavit.
it
is
my
understanding
further
that
the
appellees
intend
to
enforce
the
statute
as
construed
in
the
future.
it
is
my
understanding
that
my
clients
intend
to
occupy
a
ballot
position
in
the
1972
election
and
presumably
will
attempt
to
have
a
ballot
position
in
subsequent
elections
as
well.
so,
they
are
still
operating
under
the
gun
of
this
affidavit
requirement
and
the
statute
itself.
for
this
election,
the
appellees
or,
well
i
guess
he
is
not
a
successor
at
this
point,
presumably
could
refuse
that
position
on
the
ballot
for
failure
to
file
the
affidavit.
i
know
that
he
is,
in
fact,
precluding
them
at
this
election
but
he
could
certainly
do
it
in
a
subsequent
election.
so,
for
those
various
reasons,
we
do
believe
that
the
pleadings
are
a
little
bit
skimpy,
do
assert
or
an
alleged
irreparable
harm
and
do
meet
the
test
of
pleading
and
state
before
this
court
and
adequately
right
controversy
for
this
position
by
the
court.
i
just
wanted
to
address
two
other
points
that
came
up
in
argument
on
the
part
of
the
appellees.
the
first,
perhaps
the
minor
or
more
minor
point,
is
appellee
represents
to
this
court,
to
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
in
ex
parte
beck
versus
hummel,
adopted
a
rule
that
the
affidavit
when
filed
are
presumed
to
be
true
and
made
in
good
faith.
now,
i
have
been
re-reading
the
language
of
the
supreme
of
ohio
on
that
particular
point
and
perhaps
i
believe
something,
but
i
find
that
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
says,
there
is
no
showing
in
the
record
before
the
secretary
that
anyone
connected
with
the
ohio
wallace
for
president
committee
advocates
the
overthrow
of
government
by
force.
and
the
fact
that
some
members
among
the
many
thousands
made
along
to
the
communist
party,
or
the
communist
may
advocate
the
election
of
wallace
is
no
proof
that
the
affidavit
is
in
accordance
with
the
statute
were
was
not
filed
in
good
faith
or
that
it
is
not
efficacious
for
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
filed.
all
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
presumable
is
saying
is
once
that
the
affidavit
is
filed,
the
burden
of
going
forward
shifts
to
the
secretary
and
he
must
take
some
steps
to
investigate.
it
does
nothing
about
the
ultimate
burden
of
truth.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
perhaps
initially,
it
is
presumed
to
be
true.
but
the
next
point
is,
mr.
justice
marshall,
once
the
secretary
conducts
his
investigation,
his
findings
are
sustained
unless
they
are
not
supported
by
a
substantial
evidence
or
are
against
the
weight
of
the
evidence
which
is
hardly
the
kind
of
test
that
this
court
has
applied
in
cases
like
speiser
and
other
cases
involving
scrutiny
of
administrative
determinations
behind
upon
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
the
complaint
certainly
does
not
specifically
allege
that
they
would
refuse
to
do
so.
but,
i
do
not
think
that
is
a
fatal
flaw
in
pleading
because
presumably
even
if
they
executed
the
affidavit,
they
are
still
subject
to
the
burden
of
the
statute
and
that
does
not
get
them
on
the
ballot
automatically.
the
other
flaws
in
the
ohio
provision
and
procedure
are
still
clearly
before
the
court.
i
am
sorry
that
i
am
not
talking
with
the
affidavits
that
supported
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
no,
i
am
sorry
mr.
chief
justice.
i
am
referring
to
the
investigation
that
is
to
be
conducted
by
the
secretary
of
state
for
him
to
make
a
determination
of
whether
the
party
should
have
a
ballot
position.
the
statute
does
not
just
let
it
rest
on
affidavits.
it
charges
the
secretary
of
state
to
go
forward
and
conduct
an
investigation,
quite
exclusively
charges
him
to
conduct
an
investigation.
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
opinions
of
any
of
the
courts
to
deal
with
this
statute
to
indicate
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well,
in
the
context
of
the
first
amendment
of
course
and
the
vagueness
in
overbreadth
doctrine,
according
to
the
decisions
of
this
court,
it
is
not
necessary
for
us
to
put
ourselves
precisely
in
the
position
of
being
denied
of
ballot
position.
in
fact,
in
speiser
versus
randall,
the
procedure
is
infirmed
from
beginning
to
end,
we
do
not
have
to
take
the
first
step
to
conform
to
that
procedure,
we
can
stop
at
the
door
and
say
this
is
bad,
we
go
no
further
and
we
have
adequate
standing
and
right
enough
controversy
to
raise
of
all
of
those
issues.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
unless
there
is
something
in
the
affidavit
in
support
of
the
motion
for
summary
judgment,
we
don’t.
and
i
am
sorry,
i
am
just
not
cognizant,
that
may
be
on
the
record
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes,
but
the
record,
of
course,
the
case
includes
the
record
and
the
record
includes
the
affidavit
in
support
of
motion
for
summary
judgment.
i
am
just
not
familiar
with
that
portion
of
the
record.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
that
is
correct.
we
also
have
of
course
page
18
of
the
appendix,
the
answers
of
the
defendants.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
20
and
21
are
denied.
that
is
all
that
we
have.
that
end
the
determination
of
the
district
court
that
it
felt
it
had
a
lie
of
controversy
before
it
at
the
time
and
certainly
in
view
of
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
in
the
beck
case,
it
certainly
feels
like
a
lie
of
controversy.
the
highest
court
of
ohio
said
this
is
a
viable
operational
statute.
the
only
other
decision
are
in
point
of
that
particular
statute
also
sustained
it
as
a
lie
of
viable
statute,
on
that
case
is
state
ex
rel.
beck
versus
hummel,
59
n.e.
2d
238
as
a
court
of
appeals
decision
in
ohio.
but
so
far,
as
the
record
is
concerned,
you
are
quite
right,
mr.
justice
stewart,
as
i
have
suggested,
i
do
think
that
this
does
still
present
the
case.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes,
the
allegation
is
that
they
would
be
a
irreparable
harm,
that
it
will
subject
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
to
an
investigation
of
whether
they
are
engaged
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
the
affidavit
itself
puts
them
on
record
in
terms
of
their
political
views
and
their
political
position.
none
of
the
other
loyalty
of
the
case
is
required
the
actual
presentation
of
the
affidavit,
the
request
for
the
affidavit
itself
is
adequately
chilling.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
think,
i
hope
that
the
affidavit
in
support
of
motion
for
summary
judgment
will
bear
that
out.
secondly,
even
if
not
the
statute
is
still
before
the
court,
even
assuming
my
clients
worked
to
execute
such
an
affidavit,
the
statutory
machinery
becomes
engaged
and
that
machinery
does
itself
have
the
kind
of
chilling
effect
which
they
can
complain
about
even
after
they
filed
the
affidavit.
it
still
puts
upon
them
the
burden
of
going
forward,
the
burden
of
ultimate
proof
and
provides
them
with
no
procedural
safeguards
in
terms
of
the
investigation
and
fact
finding
determination.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
but,
i’ve
just
suggested
one
way
in
which
he
has
been
hurt
and
i
don’t
think
that
this
is
a
case
in
which
somebody
has
been
trying
to
go
through
a
code
and
find
a
law
and
hunted
peck
sort
of
like
sorting
strawberries.
this
case
has
to
be
evaluated
in
context.
the
ohio
election
law
has
been
in
litigation
for
five
years
now.
this
is
running
into
the
fifth
year,
this
is
the
third
case
to
come
before
the
supreme
court
on
its
merits.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
when
it’s
particular
pleading,
i
am
trying
to
in
effect
formulate
the
context
in
which
this
suit
would
be
actually
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
that’s
right.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes,
in
that
fact.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
right,
but
i
am
trying
to
suggest
that
it
was
a
complicated
lawsuit
that
was
being
mounted
and
that
a
lot
of
the
energy
in
terms
of
the
pleadings
may
have
been
focused
on
some
of
the
other
provisions
as
well
as
upon
this
provision
just
as
when
we
formulated
our
brief
to
this
court.
but
unfortunately
we
spent
some
15
or
16
pages
dealing
with
the
issues
involved
in
this
particular
provision
but
we
focused
more
on
the
other
provisions
that
we
were
attacking
as
well
as
this
provision
and
indeed
the
appellees
were
found
themselves
in
precisely
the
same
setting
in
an
effort
to
keep
the
suit
within
manageable
paper
range.

the
affidavit
in
support
of
the
motion
for

judgment?
mr.

i
would
assume
it
is

you

thank
you
very
much.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
constitutionality
of
ohio
revised
code
section
3517.07
which
imposes
political
tests
on
access
to
the
ballot
in
ohio.
the
statute
is
set
out
in
the
appendix
in
pages
12
through
13.
but
it
precludes
from
the
ballot
in
ohio
elections,
and
if
i
may
quote
briefly
from
the
statute,
“any
political
party
or
group
which
advocates,
either
directly
or
indirectly,
the
overthrow,
by
force
or
violence,
of
our
local
state
or
national
government
or
which
carries
on
a
program
of
sedition
or
treason
by
radio,
speech
or
press
or
which
has
in
any
manner,
any
connection
with
any
foreign
government
or
power
or
which
in
manner
has
any
connection
with
any
group
or
organization
so
connected
or
so
advocating
the
overthrow
by
force
or
violence
of
these
various
governments.
exempted
from
this
requirement
of
the
statute,
that
the
party
to
get
on
the
ballot
actually
meet
these
tests,
are
parties
and
groups
that
have
a
place
on
the
ballot
in
each
national
and
gubernatorial
election
in
ohio
since
1900.
those
two
parties
--
there
are
only
two
parties
that
meet
that
tests.
of
course,
those
are
the
democratic
and
republican
parties.
under
the
statute
to
secure
a
ballot
position
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
of
course
not,
your
honor.
i
am
implying
an
argument
that
i’ll
get
to
some
what
later
which
is
an
equal
protection
argument
that
by
exempting
any
parties
from
this
requirement,
the
state
is
drawing
invidious
classification.
and
i
will
come
to
that
argument
if
i
may,
your
honor.
but
under
the
statute,
parties
that
do
have
to
meet
this
test
in
fact
have
to
submit
an
affidavit
signed
by
10
members
of
the
party
or
group,
three
of
whom
are
to
be
executive
officers
of
the
party.
after
the
affidavit
in
the
form
of
the
statute
is
executed
and
filed
to
the
secretary
of
state.
the
secretary
of
state
is
required
to
conduct
his
own
investigation
of
the
facts
appearing
on
the
affidavit
and
to
make
his
own
determination
of
whether
the
party
or
group
should
be
on
the
ballot.
now
the
plaintiffs
brought
suit
in
1970,
challenging
this
provision
as
well
as
any
number
of
other
ohio
provisions,
but
those
provisions
which
were
in
the
litigation
have
all
been
washout
of
this
suit
by
subsequent
action
of
the
legislature
of
ohio.
we
sought
an
injunctive
and
declaratory
relief
from
a
prejudge
statutory
court
and
on
may
5,
1970,
the
district
court
declared
the
provision,
the
statute
of
ohio
unconstitutional
on
its
face,
but
reading
the
controlling
and
only
decision
of
the
ohio
supreme
court
on
the
statute,
the
state
ex
rel.
beck
v.
hummel
case,
excuse
me,
to
narrow
the
statute.
the
court
upheld
the
statute
as
construed
and
thus
the
court
held
that
the
statute
now
means
and
this
is
quote
in
the
appendix
of
page
62,
that
an
oath
is
required
that;
one,
the
party
is
not
engaged
in
an
attempt
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
or
violence.
two,
the
party
does
not
carry
on
a
program
of
sedition
or
treason
as
defined
by
criminal
law.
and
three,
the
party
is
not
knowingly
associated
with
a
group
attempting
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
or
violence.
plaintiffs
appealed
from
the
denial
of
their
injunction
upholding
the
statute
is
construed,
defendants
have
cross
appealed
from
so
much
of
the
decision
of
the
three-judge
district
court
holding
the
statute
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
plaintiffs
request
this
court
to
reverse
and
remand
with
directions
to
the
district
court
to
declare
entire
statute
unconstitutional
and
to
enjoin
its
enforcement
in
the
future.
there
are
several
reasons
why
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
some
of
these
reasons
go
to
the
statute
on
its
face,
some
go
to
the
statute
as
construed
and
interpreted
by
the
district
court
with
the
assistance
in
ohio
supreme
court
and
some
relate
to
both.
it’s
the
position
of
plaintiffs
that
the
starting
point
for
analysis
of
this
statute
is
an
appreciation
of
the
importance
of
the
right
to
vote
and
to
gain
access
to
the
ballot.
this
court
in
numerous
decisions
over
the
last
decades
has
held
for
example
as
in
wesberry
versus
sanders,
that
no
right
is
more
precious
in
a
free
country
than
not
of
having
a
voice
in
the
election
of
those
who
make
the
laws
unto
which
its
good
citizens
we
must
live.
other
rights
even
the
most
basic
are
elusory
if
the
right
to
vote
is
undermined.
it
is
our
first
position
in
this
case,
your
honors
that
there
is
an
absolute
right
on
the
part
of
the
electorate
to
vote
for
candidates
for
public
office
without
the
state
interposing
any
kind
of
a
screen
between
that
right
to
vote
and
access
to
the
ballot.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes,
it
was
your
honor.
it
was
a
three-judge
court.
you
recall
the
case
did
come
up
as
one
of
two
consolidating
cases
involving
a
broad
gauge
attack
to
a
number
of
ohio
election
provisions,
and
as
i
suggested,
most
of
those
provisions
have
been
mooted
out
of
the
case
by
a
legislative
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
right.
and
this
is
the
only
provision
that
appears
to
remain.
okay,
we
think
that
there
is
a
very
substantial,
first
amendment
component
to
the
right
to
vote.
we
believe
that
this
court
has
recognized
that
substantial
first
amendment
component.
in
the
predecessor
to
this
case,
williams
versus
rhodes
for
example,
the
decision
by
justice
black
on
equal
protection
grounds
started
of
from
an
appreciation
of
the
fact
the
right
of
individuals
to
associate
for
advancement
of
political
beliefs
and
the
right
of
qualified
voters
regardless
of
their
political
persuasion
to
cast
there
votes
effectively
is
a
fundamental
right
and
was
the
issue
involved
in
that
particular
case
and
indeed
remains
the
issue
in
this
case.
for
our
first
position
on
this
law
is
that
ohio
has
no
right
to
interpose
any
kind
of
a
political
test
for
the
vote
itself
and
for
access
to
the
ballot.
the
question
of
what
ohio
may
do
in
terms
of
qualifying
elected
officials
when
it
comes
time
for
them
to
take
their
oath
of
office
is
not
a
question
before
this
court,
we
don’t
even
act
that
point.
so
we
would
submit
that
not
even
the
oath
of
office
contemplated
in
article
6
of
the
constitution
in
the
united
states
is
appropriate.
now,
on
the
other
hand,
should
the
court
be
reticent
about
taking
this
particular
step
in
this
case.
our
second
position
is,
that
article
6
of
the
constitution
which
provides
for
a
constitutional
oath
of
office
for
elected
officials
in
the
united
states
read
together
with
amendment
number
1
has
to
mean
that
at
most
in
terms
of
political
credentials,
speech
and
association
credentials
of
candidates
for
public
office,
parties
on
about,
all
that
can
be
required
is
a
test
basically
in
the
form
of
in
article
6
affidavit
or
oath
of
office.
we
believe
that
this,
although
is
not
the
holding
of
the
court
in
the
case
of
bond
versus
floyd
involving
access
to
the
legislature
in
the
state
of
georgia
and
it
is
not
of
course
the
holding
of
the
case
in
this
court’s
decisions
in
powell
versus
mccormack
involving
the
court’s
ability
to
review
a
determination
by
the
congress
that
a
member
should
be
refused
his
sit
and
holding
that
the
house
is
limited
in
its
consideration
only
to
those
constitutional
requisites
which
the
member
must
meet
and
which
are
set
forth.
these
two
decisions
do
imply
very
strongly
at
the
most
that
the
state
may
require
the
article
6
kind
of
test.
we
would
refer
the
court
as
well
to
a
number
of
state
court
decisions,
the
leading
one
of
which
--
although
dealing
with
state
constitutional
law
is
imbrie
versus
marsh.
it
is
not
cited
in
brief
unfortunately,
it
is
a
decision
of
chief
justice
vanderbilt
of
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
and
its
reference
is
71
atlantic
second
352,
three
new
jersey
578,
in
which
chief
justice
vanderbilt
faced
with
a
state
law
of
new
jersey
which
added
to
the
qualifications
for
ballot
access
and
for
office
as
an
elected
official,
things
that
were
not
contemplated
in
the
constitutional
oath
provided
under
federal
and
state
constitution.
the
court
ruled
quite
clearly
that
the
constitutional
oath
requirement
brooked
no
additions,
whatsoever.
on
this
point,
the
court
might
also
refer
to
shub
v.
simpson
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
decision,
although
it
disavowed
the
imbrie
case
so
far
as
state
offices
are
concerned,
it
clearly
accepted
the
imbrie
rationale
on
a
preemption
basis
so
far
as
federal
elected
officers
are
concerned.
now,
in
addition
to
our
first
two
points,
we
have
a
number
which
are
perhaps
more
fully
briefed
in
our
brief.
the
third
point
on
constitutionality
of
this
ohio
provision
pertains
to
the
statutes
invasion
of
the
right
to
political
association.
the
statute
does
not
even
screen
candidates
as
such.
it
is
not
a
requirement
that
a
candidate
execute
an
oath
which
was
precisely
the
question
before
this
court
in
the
guinn
case
of
which
the
district
court
below
made
much.
that’s
not
the
case,
the
question
in
this
case.
what
we
have
here
is
a
statute
which
presumes
to
screen
political
congeries,
associations,
groups
and
parties
and
to
keep
them
off
of
the
ballot.
we
will
submit
the
cases
like
gibson
v.
florida
legislative
investigation
committee
and
naacp
v.
alabama
would
suggest
that
such
a
statute
is
at
least
constitutionally
presumptively
unconstitutional.
in
addition,
since
the
statute
requires
that
10
members
of
the
party
whether
candidates
or
not,
only
three
of
whom
are
to
the
offices
of
the
party
must
execute
the
affidavit,
there
is
a
direct
invasion
of
the
associational
rights
of
those
individuals
as
indicated
in
the
shelton
and
bates
decisions
and
the
decisions
involving
the
subversive
activities
control
act
and
the
registration
requirements
for
communist
action
organizations,
albertson
v.
cp
and
the
like.
this
statute
in
addition
is
unconstitutionally
overbroad.
it
is
perfectly
clear
the
statute
on
its
face
if
all
the
court
had
before
was
the
statutory
language
is
unconstitutionally
broad.
with
fully
briefed
that
point
and
i
won’t
go
over
the
statute
on
its
face
in
terms
of
the
overbreadth.
the
state
does
suggest
that
the
statute
is
still
constitutional
on
its
face,
but
the
district
court
below
certainly
held
to
the
contrary.
we
submit
that
even
as
construed
by
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
in
the
beck
case,
the
statute
is
unconstitutionally
broad
and
indeed
the
district
court
below
misread
the
supreme
court
of
ohio’s
decision.
it
is
our
position
that
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
in
narrowing
the
statute
only
narrowed
it
to
the
point
of
drawing
a
distinction
between
violence
or
engaging
in
violence,
but
including
in
that
category
mere
advocacy
of
violence
or
violent
overthrow,
and
on
the
other
hand,
peaceable
change
as
through
use
of
the
amendment
process.
a
careful
reading
of
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
i
think,
will
make
that
clear.
in
addition,
i
think
that
although
there
are
no
other
ohio
supreme
court
decisions
on
point,
there
are
a
number
of
ohio
lower
court
decisions
dealing
with
analogous
statutes
which
seemed
to
indicate
as
well
that
their
understanding
of
the
law
in
ohio
was
--
that
the
distinction
being
drawn
is
between
violence
including
mere
advocacy
and
peaceable
change.
even
as
construed
as
interpreted
by
the
district
court
below,
however,
the
statue
remains
unconstitutionally
broad.
again,
to
a
large
extent,
this
point
has
taken
up
in
our
argument
i
just
mentioned
the
two
most
notable
aspects
of
the
overbreadth
statute
as
construed
by
the
district
court.
fourth,
the
district
court
in
its
narrowing
construction
of
statutes
speaks
of
the
party
knowingly
associated
or
associating
with
a
group
attempting
to
overthrow
government
by
force
or
violence.
we
submit
that
the
use
of
the
term
knowingly
associated
is
two-open
ended
even
though
this
term
itself
two-open
ended,
in
addition,
we
submit
that
this
criterion
established
by
the
district
court
does
not
take
account
of
numerous
decisions
of
this
court
which
hold
that
mere
knowing
association
membership
in
or
participation
in
a
group
which
is
engaged
in
or
advocating
violent
overthrow
is
not
enough.
there
must
be
specific
intent
on
the
part
of
the
person
or
in
this
case
party
associating
to
further
or
fulfill
the
unlawful
goals
of
the
organization
which
is
engaged
in
the
unlawful
act
or
advocacy.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
we
don’t
extend
the
overbreadth
argument
to
such.
i
do
extend
the
next
point
which
of
course
is
a
vagueness
point
to
points
one
and
two.
i
must
say
to
the
extent
that
i
understand
what
number
one
means,
the
party
is
not
engaged
in
an
attempt
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
or
violence.
it
would
be
difficult
for
us
to
argue
that
that
is
overbroad,
assuming
that
this
inquiry
can
be
made
or
this
investigation
can
be
made
and
we
do
not
conceive
that.
it
seems
a
silly
thing
to
ask
somebody
to
make
an
affidavit
about
since
it
is
speaking
of
the
immediate
present
and
this
instant
and
has
no
reference
to
future
behavior
activity,
but
i
suppose
we
couldn’t
say
it
is
overbroad
if
anything,
it
is
incredibly
narrow.
however,
we
do
think
that
there
may
be
some
vagaries
involved
in
that
particular
language.
excuse
me.
less
in
a
point
one,
except
this
red
with
the
statute
itself
than
in
the
point
two,
the
party
does
not
carry
on
a
program
of
sedition
or
treason
as
defined
by
the
criminal
law.
well,
i
supposed
we
know
what
treason
means
under
the
criminal
law.
i
assume,
and
i
think
the
court
would
assume
that
treason
would
be
limited
by
article
3
of
the
constitution
to
mean
making
war
on
the
united
states
or
any
of
them
or
adhering
to
their
enemies
proven
according
to
the
two-witness
rule
or
open
confession.
and
indeed,
i
believe
there
is
an
ohio
statute
on
treason
though
i
don’t
know
that
it
has
ever
been
enforced.
however,
there
is
no
sedition
law
in
ohio.
the
closes
thing
to
a
sedition
law
in
ohio
was
the
criminal
syndicalism
act
which
this
court
declared
was
unconstitutional
in
brandenburg
versus
ohio.
there
is
no
referent
in
ohio
jurisprudence
at
all
for
meaning
for
the
term
sedition
and
of
course
this
court
has
recognized
–
i’ve
had
the
reference
to
your
language
mr.
justice
brennan
on
the
difficulty
the
court
has
with
you,
so
those
two
words,
sedition
and
treason
and
the
difficulty
of
the
defining
them.
but
that
is
quoted
in
the
brief
and
we
would
rest
on
that
proposition
so
far
as
the
construction
by
the
district
court
is
concerned,
these
are
the
primary
vague
provisions
in
this
newly
construed
statute.
but
again,
we
do
not
agree
that
the
district
court
was
correct
in
its
construction
in
light
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio’s
view.
we
think
it’s
perfectly
clear
further
that
the
vagueness
that’s
found
on
the
statute
and
the
overbreadth
is
incredibly
magnified
by
the
deprivations
of
due
process
of
law
in
a
procedural
sense
that
are
found
in
the
statute.
first
is
a
burden
of
going
forward
which
is
placed
immediately
upon
the
party.
the
statute
requires
that
an
affidavit
be
submitted
on
behalf
of
the
political
party
or
group.
it
seems
to
us
that
that
kind
of
a
requirement
is
interdicted
by
this
court’s
decision
in
speiser
versus
randall,
once
you’re
in
the
first
amendment
area.
further,
the
affidavit
isn’t
enough.
it
is
not
even
presumptively
dispositive
of
the
facts
of
not
being
subversive
or
not
fitting
within
the
statute.
the
statute
provides
that
the
secretary
of
state
shall
undertake
an
independent
investigation,
and
the
evidence
of
the
kind
of
an
investigation
the
secretary
of
state
is
likely
to
conduct
is
presented
in
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
in
the
beck
v.
hummel
case.
it
was
cursory
and
anti
first
amendment
at
best.
and
so
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
itself
found
in
that
particular
case.
in
the
course
of
the
investigation,
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
ruled
that
the
secretary
of
state
need,
provide
no
hearing,
none
whatsoever,
he
can
do
his
own
ex
parte
investigation.
clear
offense
to
procedural
due
process
and
further,
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
ruled
that
once
he
made
his
findings
and
certified
that
the
party
or
group
should
not
have
access
to
the
ballot,
it
should
not
be
placed
upon
the
ballot.
the
supreme
court
ruled
they
would
review,
they
and
the
other
ohio
courts
review
according
to
a
test
of
substantial
evidence.
whether
there
is
substantial
evidence,
i
assume
the
court
meant
on
the
record
as
a
whole
to
support
the
decision
of
the
secretary
of
state,
although
the
test
may
not
be
even
as
generous
to
the
party
or
group
as
a
substantial
evidence
rule
because
the
court
also
speaks
about
reviewing
according
to
a
determination
whether
will
overrule
the
secretary
of
state,
only
if
his
finding
is
manifestly
against
the
weight
of
the
evidence.
much
too
stringent
and
evidentiary
test
onto
this
court’s
decisions
in
speiser
versus
randall,
kernel
versus
hagen
buffin,
and
law
students
association
versus
wadmond,
so
again,
another
constitutional
infirmity
in
the
scheme.
and
finally,
to
return
to
the
point
that
justice
stewart
brought
out
in
his
question.
we
think
all
of
these
defects
are
further
magnified
by
the
fact
that
there
is
an
exemption
for
parties
with
a
great
deal
of
continuous
longevity
on
the
ballot
in
the
state
of
ohio,
those
two
parties
of
course
being
the
democrats
and
republicans.
we
do
not
imply
at
this
time
that
either
of
those
parties
would
have
difficulty
securing
the
ballot
position
under
the
test
of
this
statute
even
as
construed
assumingly
quite
understand
what
they
are.
what
we
do
mean
to
imply
is
your
observation
justice
stewart
in
jenness
versus
fortson
where
you
said
time
after
time,
established
political
parties
at
local
state
and
national
levels
has
while
maintaining
their
old
labels,
change
the
ideological
direction
because
of
influence
and
leadership
of
those
with
unorthodox
or
“radical”
views.
the
history
of
this
united
states
is
replete
with
examples
of
changes
of
ideological
direction
on
the
part
of
political
parties
in
the
united
states.
i
just
reviewed
a
document
that
had
been
prepared
by
the
former
secretary
of
state
of
ohio
on
the
election
experience
in
ohio
over
a
long
period
of
time
from
the
beginning
of
the
republic
to
the
present.
i
counted
37
separate
political
parties
of
whom
i
know
at
least
10
engaged
in
one
type
of
metamorphosis
or
another
of
which
several
were
more
or
less
revolutionary
for
their
time
including
the
evolutionist
part.
presumably
that
party
might
not
be
able
to
secure
ballot
position
in
ohio
today
if
it
attempted
to
go
on
the
ballot.
on
the
basis
of
this
various
defects,
it
is
the
appellants’
position
that
the
decision
of
the
court
below
should
be
reversed,
the
case
remanded
and
with
instructions
to
enjoin
the
operation
of
statute.
i
would
like
to
reserve
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
if
i
may
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
your
honor,
i
cannot
honestly
say,
i
have
not
seen
those
affidavits
in
a
while
myself
and
i
do
not
recall
what
they
are
in
the
file
but
your
question,
it
seems
to
me
is
a
broader
question
addressed
to,
precisely
the
consideration
that
mr.
justice
stewart
was
raising
and
that
was
the
first
point
that
i
did
wished
to
make
on
rebuttal.
and
that
is,
how
was
the
issue
raised
and
why
is
it
in
such
a
rather
thin
status?
it
may
well
be
that
the
affidavit
still
allege
additional
harm.
the
issue
was
raised
in
the
following
form,
your
honors.
the
complaint
was
filed
on
january
28,
1970.
now,
for
complaint
to
be
filed
on
that
day,
it
was
impossible
under
the
statute
for
my
clients
to
execute
the
affidavit.
the
statute
provides
that
the
affidavit
must
be
filed
with
the
secretary
of
state
between
nine
months
prior
to
the
next
election
and
six
months
prior
to
the
next
election.
conceivably,
they
might
have
waited
a
few
more
weeks
to
actually
submit
the
affidavit
or
to
make
a
request
for
consideration
on
the
ballot,
for
placement
on
the
ballot,
without
an
affidavit
or
they
might
have
try
to
fulfill
all
other
requirements
for
inclusion
on
the
ballot
without
an
affidavit
but
you
have
to
recall
this
case
has
a
history.
that
case
has
been
before
this
court
once,
twice,
the
ohio
election
laws
have
been
before
this
court.
this
is
the
third
time
there
was
a
small
portion
that
the
ohio
election
law
has
dealt
within
the
zepalady
case,
i
believe,
which
this
court
did
resolved
in
summary
fashion
earlier
this
term,
and
of
course
williams
versus
rhodes.
and
my
clients,
reading
williams
versus
rhodes,
and
being
cognizant
of
the
fact
that
they
were
denied,
injunctive
relief
by
you,
mr.
justice
stewart,
and
then
confirmed
by
the
court
in
william
versus
rhodes
for
failure
to
prosecute
their
cause
of
action
quickly,
can
hardly
be
faulted
for
moving
at
the
earliest
possible
opportunity
to
challenge
as
many
as
the
provisions
of
the
interconnected,
into
tangled
web
of
ohio
election
laws
which
they
believe
were
inhibiting
their
ability
to
get
ballot
position.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
now,
on
an
oath
type-provision,
it
has
not
been
the
understanding
of
this
court
that
there
is
any
requirement
that
efforts
be
made
to
comply
with
the
oath
requirement
first.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well,
but
you
see
as
the
case
was
formulated,
this
was
one
of
ten
provisions
engaged
in
two
separate
lawsuits
that
were
consolidated
in
order
to
try
to
bring
to
an
end
the
questions
over
the
ohio
elections
laws,
our
clients,
decided
to
go
in
one
lawsuit
and
to
bring
all
of
their
challenges
at
once.
it
doesn’t
seem
to
me
possible
that
they
could
have
attempted
to
comply
by
registration
requirements.
they
could
not
register
because
they
did
not
have
the
requisite
number
of
signatures
at
that
point.
they
weren’t
in
the
position
yet
to
attempt
to
certify
that
they
wanted
to
have
a
primary
yet.
they
were
challenging
the
primary
provisions.
they
were
challenging
an
entire
range
of
provisions.
some
of
which
had
some
bearing
on
the
rightness,
with
the
pure
rightness
of
the
way
in,
which
the
affidavit
provision
might
be
dealt
with.
now,
in
order
to
bring
their
challenge
to
the
affidavit
provision
early
enough
to
get
complete
relief
before
the
1970
election,
they
have
to
bring
it
all
in
one
lawsuit,
and
it
seems
to
me
that’s
the
reason
why
there
wasn’t
a
kind
of
pleading
that
justice
stewart
was
alluding
to,
which
would
focus
on
the
specific
harm
of
this
kind
of
an
affidavit.
it
is
my
understanding
further
that
the
appellees
intend
to
enforce
the
statute
as
construed
in
the
future.
it
is
my
understanding
that
my
clients
intend
to
occupy
a
ballot
position
in
the
1972
election
and
presumably
will
attempt
to
have
a
ballot
position
in
subsequent
elections
as
well.
so,
they
are
still
operating
under
the
gun
of
this
affidavit
requirement
and
the
statute
itself.
for
this
election,
the
appellees
or,
well
i
guess
he
is
not
a
successor
at
this
point,
presumably
could
refuse
that
position
on
the
ballot
for
failure
to
file
the
affidavit.
i
know
that
he
is,
in
fact,
precluding
them
at
this
election
but
he
could
certainly
do
it
in
a
subsequent
election.
so,
for
those
various
reasons,
we
do
believe
that
the
pleadings
are
a
little
bit
skimpy,
do
assert
or
an
alleged
irreparable
harm
and
do
meet
the
test
of
pleading
and
state
before
this
court
and
adequately
right
controversy
for
this
position
by
the
court.
i
just
wanted
to
address
two
other
points
that
came
up
in
argument
on
the
part
of
the
appellees.
the
first,
perhaps
the
minor
or
more
minor
point,
is
appellee
represents
to
this
court,
to
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
in
ex
parte
beck
versus
hummel,
adopted
a
rule
that
the
affidavit
when
filed
are
presumed
to
be
true
and
made
in
good
faith.
now,
i
have
been
re-reading
the
language
of
the
supreme
of
ohio
on
that
particular
point
and
perhaps
i
believe
something,
but
i
find
that
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
says,
there
is
no
showing
in
the
record
before
the
secretary
that
anyone
connected
with
the
ohio
wallace
for
president
committee
advocates
the
overthrow
of
government
by
force.
and
the
fact
that
some
members
among
the
many
thousands
made
along
to
the
communist
party,
or
the
communist
may
advocate
the
election
of
wallace
is
no
proof
that
the
affidavit
is
in
accordance
with
the
statute
were
was
not
filed
in
good
faith
or
that
it
is
not
efficacious
for
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
filed.
all
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
presumable
is
saying
is
once
that
the
affidavit
is
filed,
the
burden
of
going
forward
shifts
to
the
secretary
and
he
must
take
some
steps
to
investigate.
it
does
nothing
about
the
ultimate
burden
of
truth.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
perhaps
initially,
it
is
presumed
to
be
true.
but
the
next
point
is,
mr.
justice
marshall,
once
the
secretary
conducts
his
investigation,
his
findings
are
sustained
unless
they
are
not
supported
by
a
substantial
evidence
or
are
against
the
weight
of
the
evidence
which
is
hardly
the
kind
of
test
that
this
court
has
applied
in
cases
like
speiser
and
other
cases
involving
scrutiny
of
administrative
determinations
behind
upon
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
the
complaint
certainly
does
not
specifically
allege
that
they
would
refuse
to
do
so.
but,
i
do
not
think
that
is
a
fatal
flaw
in
pleading
because
presumably
even
if
they
executed
the
affidavit,
they
are
still
subject
to
the
burden
of
the
statute
and
that
does
not
get
them
on
the
ballot
automatically.
the
other
flaws
in
the
ohio
provision
and
procedure
are
still
clearly
before
the
court.
i
am
sorry
that
i
am
not
talking
with
the
affidavits
that
supported
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
no,
i
am
sorry
mr.
chief
justice.
i
am
referring
to
the
investigation
that
is
to
be
conducted
by
the
secretary
of
state
for
him
to
make
a
determination
of
whether
the
party
should
have
a
ballot
position.
the
statute
does
not
just
let
it
rest
on
affidavits.
it
charges
the
secretary
of
state
to
go
forward
and
conduct
an
investigation,
quite
exclusively
charges
him
to
conduct
an
investigation.
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
opinions
of
any
of
the
courts
to
deal
with
this
statute
to
indicate
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well,
in
the
context
of
the
first
amendment
of
course
and
the
vagueness
in
overbreadth
doctrine,
according
to
the
decisions
of
this
court,
it
is
not
necessary
for
us
to
put
ourselves
precisely
in
the
position
of
being
denied
of
ballot
position.
in
fact,
in
speiser
versus
randall,
the
procedure
is
infirmed
from
beginning
to
end,
we
do
not
have
to
take
the
first
step
to
conform
to
that
procedure,
we
can
stop
at
the
door
and
say
this
is
bad,
we
go
no
further
and
we
have
adequate
standing
and
right
enough
controversy
to
raise
of
all
of
those
issues.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
unless
there
is
something
in
the
affidavit
in
support
of
the
motion
for
summary
judgment,
we
don’t.
and
i
am
sorry,
i
am
just
not
cognizant,
that
may
be
on
the
record
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes,
but
the
record,
of
course,
the
case
includes
the
record
and
the
record
includes
the
affidavit
in
support
of
motion
for
summary
judgment.
i
am
just
not
familiar
with
that
portion
of
the
record.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
that
is
correct.
we
also
have
of
course
page
18
of
the
appendix,
the
answers
of
the
defendants.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
20
and
21
are
denied.
that
is
all
that
we
have.
that
end
the
determination
of
the
district
court
that
it
felt
it
had
a
lie
of
controversy
before
it
at
the
time
and
certainly
in
view
of
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
in
the
beck
case,
it
certainly
feels
like
a
lie
of
controversy.
the
highest
court
of
ohio
said
this
is
a
viable
operational
statute.
the
only
other
decision
are
in
point
of
that
particular
statute
also
sustained
it
as
a
lie
of
viable
statute,
on
that
case
is
state
ex
rel.
beck
versus
hummel,
59
n.e.
2d
238
as
a
court
of
appeals
decision
in
ohio.
but
so
far,
as
the
record
is
concerned,
you
are
quite
right,
mr.
justice
stewart,
as
i
have
suggested,
i
do
think
that
this
does
still
present
the
case.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes,
the
allegation
is
that
they
would
be
a
irreparable
harm,
that
it
will
subject
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
to
an
investigation
of
whether
they
are
engaged
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
the
affidavit
itself
puts
them
on
record
in
terms
of
their
political
views
and
their
political
position.
none
of
the
other
loyalty
of
the
case
is
required
the
actual
presentation
of
the
affidavit,
the
request
for
the
affidavit
itself
is
adequately
chilling.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
think,
i
hope
that
the
affidavit
in
support
of
motion
for
summary
judgment
will
bear
that
out.
secondly,
even
if
not
the
statute
is
still
before
the
court,
even
assuming
my
clients
worked
to
execute
such
an
affidavit,
the
statutory
machinery
becomes
engaged
and
that
machinery
does
itself
have
the
kind
of
chilling
effect
which
they
can
complain
about
even
after
they
filed
the
affidavit.
it
still
puts
upon
them
the
burden
of
going
forward,
the
burden
of
ultimate
proof
and
provides
them
with
no
procedural
safeguards
in
terms
of
the
investigation
and
fact
finding
determination.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
but,
i’ve
just
suggested
one
way
in
which
he
has
been
hurt
and
i
don’t
think
that
this
is
a
case
in
which
somebody
has
been
trying
to
go
through
a
code
and
find
a
law
and
hunted
peck
sort
of
like
sorting
strawberries.
this
case
has
to
be
evaluated
in
context.
the
ohio
election
law
has
been
in
litigation
for
five
years
now.
this
is
running
into
the
fifth
year,
this
is
the
third
case
to
come
before
the
supreme
court
on
its
merits.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
when
it’s
particular
pleading,
i
am
trying
to
in
effect
formulate
the
context
in
which
this
suit
would
be
actually
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
that’s
right.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes,
in
that
fact.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
right,
but
i
am
trying
to
suggest
that
it
was
a
complicated
lawsuit
that
was
being
mounted
and
that
a
lot
of
the
energy
in
terms
of
the
pleadings
may
have
been
focused
on
some
of
the
other
provisions
as
well
as
upon
this
provision
just
as
when
we
formulated
our
brief
to
this
court.
but
unfortunately
we
spent
some
15
or
16
pages
dealing
with
the
issues
involved
in
this
particular
provision
but
we
focused
more
on
the
other
provisions
that
we
were
attacking
as
well
as
this
provision
and
indeed
the
appellees
were
found
themselves
in
precisely
the
same
setting
in
an
effort
to
keep
the
suit
within
manageable
paper
range.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
the
affidavit
in
support
of
the
motion
for
summary
judgment?
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
would
assume
it
is
a
yes.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
thank
you
your
honor.
thank
you
very
much.
