mr.
donald
j.
guittar
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
answer
the
first
objection
which
has
been
raised
which
is
a
question
of
the
violation
of
due
process,
procedural
due
process.
i
think
if
the
court
will
examine
the
ohio
case
of
beck
versus
hummel.
they
will
find
out
that
the
ohio
court
and
the
ohio
law
does
not
run
a
fall
of
the
previous
decisions
of
this
court
such
as
speiser
for
this
reason.
the
secretary
of
the
state
of
ohio
makes
a
determination
on
the
basis
of
the
affidavit.
it
is
true
that
that
is
a
unilateral
determination.
the
next
step
is
he
then
refuses
to
certify
and
put
the
party
on
the
ballot.
the
next
step
then
is
that
the
person
or
i
mean
the
party
must
go
to
court.
at
this
point
and
in
the
beck
case,
the
ohio
supreme
court
held
that
the
affidavit
has
a
presumption
in
its
favor
of
good
faith
and
truth
and
that
the
secretary
of
state
in
answering
that
has
got
to
overcome
that
presumption
and
further
that
the
secretary
of
state
has
got
to
come
forward
with
substantial
evidence,
so
this
is
not
the
usual
situation.
this
is
not
the
situation
which
the
court
had
before
such
as
in
the
speiser
case
in
which
the
entire
burden
of
overturning
and
adverse
administrative
determination
was
put
on
the
part
of
the
taxpayer.
mr.
donald
j.
guittar
no,
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
socialist
labor
party
refused
to
execute
the
affidavit.
if
you
will
examine
the
pleadings,
they
sought
that
they
have
just
plead
as
their
third
course
of
action,
just
the
alleged
conflict,
the
statute
and
then
they
applied
the
conflict.
unfortunately,
i
can
not
give
you
the
fullest
factual
answer
that
i
would
like
to
mr.
justice
stewart
because
i
was
not
present
at
that
time
or
at
the
trial.
mr.
donald
j.
guittar
that’s
correct.
mr.
donald
j.
guittar
no,
they
do
not.
mr.
donald
j.
guittar
as
to
my
understanding,
based
upon
a
transcription
which
i
had
made
of
the
oral
argument
from
the
statement
of
the
attorney
for
the
socialist
labor
party
that
they
had
refused
to
execute
the
affidavit.
mr.
donald
j.
guittar
no,
it
is
not
alleged
in
the
petition.
mr.
donald
j.
guittar
that’s
right.
mr.
donald
j.
guittar
that’s
correct.
mr.
donald
j.
guittar
that’s
right
and
invoked.
mr.
donald
j.
guittar
oh,
they
do
not.
mr.
donald
j.
guittar
yes,
it
was
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
think
that
--
i
do
not
recall
whether
any
harm
is
alleged
in
the
prayer
subsequent
to
the
pleading
of
the
third
cause
of
action.
i
believe
you’re
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
believe
that
the
standard
of
substantial
evidence
which
the
ohio
supreme
court
in
the
beck
case
plays
upon
the
secretary
of
state
of
ohio
is
sufficient
to
meet
the
procedural
defective
allegations
which
the
plaintiffs
have
raised
here.
i
would
like
to
pass
on
next
to
the
question
of
the
statute
itself.
i
believe
it’s
fair
to
say
that
if
this
court
has
spoken
out
against
any
words
or
any
particular
words
and
condemned
them
for
vagueness,
the
word
advocacy
and
its
use
in
loyalty
oath.
the
court
has
repeatedly
condemned
the
use
of
that
language.
if
the
court
wishes
to
apply
that
to
a
political
party
statute,
a
political
party
oath
then
certainly,
this
statute
of
the
state
of
ohio
is
unconstitutionally
vague
and
the
ordinary
person
could
not
tell
from
use
of
the
words
advocacy
and
so
on,
whether
he
was
in
fact
violating
that
statute.
with
the
reservation
that
we
deal
here
with
a
political
party
and
the
practicalities
of
the
matter
is,
not
that
any
individual
is
punished,
but
it
is
solely
that
a
political
party
label
or
mean
does
not
go
on
the
ballot.
i
think,
in
examining
the
cases
which
the
court
has
decided
in
the
area
of
loyalty
oaths.
i
think
it
would
be
well
to
take
in
mind
that
there
is
no
discharge
and
no
dismissal
problem
here
as
the
court
has
had
before
at
so
many
times,
particularly
in
the
academic
freedom
cases.
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
we
also
are
dealing
with
a
matter
of
what
the
state
legislature
has
deemed
the
self-preservation
and
the
self
defense
of
the
state
through
requiring
the
oath
as
restricted
by
the
district
court.
mr.
donald
j.
guittar
the
interest
is
--
mr.
donald
j.
guittar
that’s
correct
in
the
statute,
mr.
justice
marshall
and
the
statute
really
does
not
operate
against
the
man.
the
man
can
go
on
the
ballot
but
he
cannot
have
a
party
label
on
it
if
the
affidavit
is
not
the
next
--
mr.
donald
j.
guittar
well,
i
believe
that,
mr.
justice
marshall,
that
an
examination
of
the
beck
decision
by
the
ohio
supreme
court,
so
as
that,
if
the
communist
party
itself
would
attended
this
oath,
that
the
ohio
supreme
court
is
recognized
that
the
fact
that
someone
is
a
communist,
it
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
they
believe
in
force
or
violence.
mr.
donald
j.
guittar
i
believe
he
can.
mr.
donald
j.
guittar
well,
yes
you
would
have
to
file
the
affidavit.
you
would
have
to
file
--
mr.
donald
j.
guittar
under
the
party
label,
that’s
right.
that’s
right.
in
other
words,
let
the
loyal
individual
--
mr.
donald
j.
guittar
well,
ohio,
i
think
it’s
fair
to
say
cannot
have
any
interest
in
keeping
loyal
american
citizens
and
citizens
of
ohio
of
the
ballot
and
i
do
not
believe
that
it
is.
mr.
donald
j.
guittar
well,
my
use
of
the
word
disloyal
was
unfortunate.
that
is
not
part
of
the
district
court’s
reading.
mr.
donald
j.
guittar
if
a
party
is
committed
to
the
overthrow,
to
attempting
to
overthrow
the
government
--
mr.
donald
j.
guittar
well,
if
they
become
elected
through
the
use
of
the
name
--
mr.
donald
j.
guittar
that’s
right,
but
if
they
also
were
not
there
--
mr.
donald
j.
guittar
it
is,
to
my
understanding,
it
is
not
an
interest
in
not
letting
him
run.
it
is
an
interest
in
not
letting
them
run
without
the
party
label,
to
my
understanding.
mr.
donald
j.
guittar
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
donald
j.
guittar
well,
unfortunately,
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
cannot
refer
you
to
legislative
history,
this
statute
which
was
passed
in
1941.
there
are
no
debates.
there
is
no
legislative
intent
to
refer
to
that
i
can
give
for
further
explanation
other
than
that
--
mr.
donald
j.
guittar
yes.
mr.
donald
j.
guittar
yes,
i
do.
mr.
donald
j.
guittar
i
know
mr.
chief
justice
marshall.
i
am
endeavoring
as
best
as
i
can
to
answer
you.
i
believe
what
you’re
asking
me
is
what
difference,
so
long
as
someone
can
be
on
the
ballot.
mr.
donald
j.
guittar
i
think
it
is
in
keeping
off
the
ballot
individuals
who
are
members
of
a
party
who
could
be
elected
through
the
use
of
a
party
name
which
party
attempts
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
and
violence,
to
thereby
become
elected
and
to
use
the
offices
of
the
state
in
an
attempt
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
or
violence.
mr.
donald
j.
guittar
with
respect
to
the
state’s
interest
in
avoiding
that
which
i
just
referred,
i
believe
this
court
has
implicitly
recognized
or
explicitly
recognized
this
interest
in
the
gardner
case,
in
the
doyle
case,
and
implicitly
in
the
duren
case.
moving
along
to
the
court’s
opinion
below,
in
the
restricted
reading
which
the
court
gave
the
statute
below
with
respect
to
item
number
one,
this
constitution,
i
believe
is
fully
constitutional.
there
are
no
cases
cited,
nor
can
there
be
any
which
do
anything
other
than
sustain
the
constitutionality
of
the
language
required
namely,
that
one,
should
not
be
attempting,
that
the
party
should
not
be
attempting,
engage
and
attempt
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
mr.
donald
j.
guittar
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
with
respect
to,
going
to
the
second
limitation
which
the
district
court
below
placed
upon
of
the
ohio
statute
3517.07,
the
second
limitation,
the
first
being
that
the
party
is
not
engaged
in
an
attempt
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
or
violence.
the
second
one,
the
party
does
not
carry
on
a
program
of
sedition
or
treason
as
defined
by
the
criminal
law.
as
my
brother
points
out
in
his
brief,
there
is
no
ohio
criminal
law
defining
sedition,
but
there
is
for
treason
and
that
is
substantially
the
same
as
the
treason
which
is
provided
by
the
federal
law.
and
the
treason
citation
is
2921.01
of
the
ohio
revised
code
has
to
do
with
the
levying
of
war.
with
respect
to,
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
the
keyishian
case,
this
court
has
specifically
validated
from
vagueness
the
treason,
the
use
of
the
word
treason
with
respect
to
oaths.
with
respect
to
the
third
provision,
which
is
that
a
party
is
not
knowingly
associated
with
the
group
attempting
to
overthrow
the
government.
i
believe
that
there
is
sufficient
scienter
in
there,
from
both
from
the
decision
of
the
ohio
supreme
court
and
the
scienter
which
can
be
implied
from
this
court’s
case
in
duren
which
was
approved
in
bengate
and
also
whitehill.
at
page
137
of
the
beck
case,
the
ohio
supreme
court,
with
respect
to
this
question
stated
that
the
individuals
involved
must
be
personally,
personally
engaged,
in
these
activities.
but
further,
if
the
court
should
find
that
there
is
not
sufficient
scienter
in
the
third
limitation
placed
on
the
oath,
we
suggest
that
the
keyishian
case
which
requires
you
must
have
a
specific
intent
to
further
the
illegal
aims
of
the
organization
would
be
a
proper
and
further
limitation.
we
believe,
for
all
the
reasons
that
the
oath
as
limited
is
not
unduly
vague
and
can
be
understood
by
those
who
required
to
sign
it
on
behalf
of
a
party.
with
respect
to
the
equal
protection
claims
violations
thereof,
i
believe,
it
is
a
legitimate
state
interest
and
can
reasonably
be
a
legislative
by
a
state
legislature,
that
parties
who
have
perpetually
participated
in
the
election
process
over
the
years
and
parties
who
have
not
had
anyone
utilize
the
state
in
attempting
to
overthrow
the
state
by
force
or
violence,
that
is
a
perfectly
proper
and
natural
use
of
the
power
and
does
not
violate
the
equal
protection.
i
would
like
to
point
one
citation
which
is
not
in
our
brief,
which
the
court
may
wish
take
in
consideration
in
its
deliberations
and
decision
on
this
case
and
that
is
lisker
vs.
kelley
which
was
affirmed
just
last
year,
401
u.s.
928.
that
case
involved
candidates
and
the
use
of
a
candidate’s
oath.
that
oath
was
found
proper
in
that
case.
in
summation,
i
urged
that
the
court
approve
defining
a
decision
of
the
district
court,
i
believe
that
the
interest
of
the
state
in
self-preservation
are
sufficient
to
require
this
party
oath.
we
believe
that
the
grounded
decision
is
still
the
law
of
the
land
and
is
controlling
in
this
case.
i
thank
the
court
very
much,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
donald
j.
guittar
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
answer
the
first
objection
which
has
been
raised
which
is
a
question
of
the
violation
of
due
process,
procedural
due
process.
i

if

speiser
for
this

the

makes
a

on
the
basis
of
the
affidavit.
it
is
true
that
that
is
a

the

at

here
as
the
court
has
had
before
at
so
many
times,
particularly
in
the
academic
freedom
cases.
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
we
also
are
dealing
with
a
matter
of
what
the
state
legislature
has
deemed
the
self-preservation
and
the
self
defense
of
the
state
through
requiring
the
oath
as
restricted
by
the
district
court.
mr.
donald
j.
guittar
the
interest
is
--
mr.
donald
j.
guittar
that’s
correct
in
the
statute,
mr.
justice
marshall
and
the
statute
really
does
not
operate
against
the
man.
the
man
can
go
on
the
ballot
but
he
cannot
have
a
party
label
on
it
if
the
affidavit
is
not
the
next
--
mr.
donald
j.
guittar
well,
i
believe
that,
mr.
justice
marshall,
that
an
examination
of
the
beck
decision
by
the
ohio
supreme
court,
so
as
that,
if
the
communist
party
itself
would
attended
this
oath,
that
the
ohio
supreme
court
is
recognized
that
the
fact
that
someone
is
a
communist,
it
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
they
believe
in
force
or
violence.
mr.
donald
j.
guittar
i
believe
he
can.
mr.
donald
j.
guittar
well,
yes
you
would
have
to
file
the
affidavit.
you
would
have
to
file
--
mr.
donald
j.
guittar
under
the
party
label,
that’s
right.
that’s
right.
in
other
words,
let
the
loyal
individual
--
mr.
donald
j.
guittar
well,
ohio,
i
think
it’s
fair
to
say
cannot
have
any
interest
in
keeping
loyal
american
citizens
and
citizens
of
ohio
of
the
ballot
and
i
do
not
believe
that
it
is.
mr.
donald
j.
guittar
well,
my
use
of
the
word
disloyal
was
unfortunate.
that
is
not
part
of
the
district
court’s
reading.
mr.
donald
j.
guittar
if
a
party
is
committed
to
the
overthrow,
to
attempting
to
overthrow
the
government
--
mr.
donald
j.
guittar
well,
if
they
become
elected
through
the
use
of
the
name
--
mr.
donald
j.
guittar
that’s
right,
but
if
they
also
were
not
there
--
mr.
donald
j.
guittar
it
is,
to
my
understanding,
it
is
not
an
interest
in
not
letting
him
run.
it
is
an
interest
in
not
letting
them
run
without
the
party
label,
to
my
understanding.
mr.
donald
j.
guittar
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
donald
j.
guittar
well,
unfortunately,
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
cannot
refer
you
to
legislative
history,
this
statute
which
was
passed
in
1941.
there
are
no
debates.
there
is
no
legislative
intent
to
refer
to
that
i
can
give
for
further
explanation
other
than
that
--
mr.
donald
j.
guittar
yes.
mr.
donald
j.
guittar
yes,
i
do.
mr.
donald
j.
guittar
i
know
mr.
chief
justice
marshall.
i
am
endeavoring
as
best
as
i
can
to
answer
you.
i
believe
what
you’re
asking
me
is
what
difference,
so
long
as
someone
can
be
on
the
ballot.
mr.
donald
j.
guittar
i
think
it
is
in
keeping
off
the
ballot
individuals
who
are
members
of
a
party
who
could
be
elected
through
the
use
of
a
party
name
which
party
attempts
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
and
violence,
to
thereby
become
elected
and
to
use
the
offices
of
the
state
in
an
attempt
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
or
violence.
mr.
donald
j.
guittar
with
respect
to
the
state’s
interest
in
avoiding
that
which
i
just
referred,
i
believe
this
court
has
implicitly
recognized
or
explicitly
recognized
this
interest
in
the
gardner
case,
in
the
doyle
case,
and
implicitly
in
the
duren
case.
moving
along
to
the
court’s
opinion
below,
in
the
restricted
reading
which
the
court
gave
the
statute
below
with
respect
to
item
number
one,
this
constitution,
i
believe
is
fully
constitutional.
there
are
no
cases
cited,
nor
can
there
be
any
which
do
anything
other
than
sustain
the
constitutionality
of
the
language
required
namely,
that
one,
should
not
be
attempting,
that
the
party
should
not
be
attempting,
engage
and
attempt
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
mr.
donald
j.
guittar
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
with
respect
to,
going
to
the
second
limitation
which
the
district
court
below
placed
upon
of
the
ohio
statute
3517.07,
the
second
limitation,
the
first
being
that
the
party
is
not
engaged
in
an
attempt
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
or
violence.
the
second
one,
the
party
does
not
carry
on
a
program
of
sedition
or
treason
as
defined
by
the
criminal
law.
as
my
brother
points
out
in
his
brief,
there
is
no
ohio
criminal
law
defining
sedition,
but
there
is
for
treason
and
that
is
substantially
the
same
as
the
treason
which
is
provided
by
the
federal
law.
and
the
treason
citation
is
2921.01
of
the
ohio
revised
code
has
to
do
with
the
levying
of
war.
with
respect
to,
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
the
keyishian
case,
this
court
has
specifically
validated
from
vagueness
the
treason,
the
use
of
the
word
treason
with
respect
to
oaths.
with
respect
to
the
third
provision,
which
is
that
a
party
is
not
knowingly
associated
with
the
group
attempting
to
overthrow
the
government.
i
believe
that
there
is
sufficient
scienter
in
there,
from
both
from
the
decision
of
the
ohio
supreme
court
and
the
scienter
which
can
be
implied
from
this
court’s
case
in
duren
which
was
approved
in
bengate
and
also
whitehill.
at
page
137
of
the
beck
case,
the
ohio
supreme
court,
with
respect
to
this
question
stated
that
the
individuals
involved
must
be
personally,
personally
engaged,
in
these
activities.
but
further,
if
the
court
should
find
that
there
is
not
sufficient
scienter
in
the
third
limitation
placed
on
the
oath,
we
suggest
that
the
keyishian
case
which
requires
you
must
have
a
specific
intent
to
further
the
illegal
aims
of
the
organization
would
be
a
proper
and
further
limitation.
we
believe,
for
all
the
reasons
that
the
oath
as
limited
is
not
unduly
vague
and
can
be
understood
by
those
who
required
to
sign
it
on
behalf
of
a
party.
with
respect
to
the
equal
protection
claims
violations
thereof,
i
believe,
it
is
a
legitimate
state
interest
and
can
reasonably
be
a
legislative
by
a
state
legislature,
that
parties
who
have
perpetually
participated
in
the
election
process
over
the
years
and
parties
who
have
not
had
anyone
utilize
the
state
in
attempting
to
overthrow
the
state
by
force
or
violence,
that
is
a
perfectly
proper
and
natural
use
of
the
power
and
does
not
violate
the
equal
protection.
i
would
like
to
point
one
citation
which
is
not
in
our
brief,
which
the
court
may
wish
take
in
consideration
in
its
deliberations
and
decision
on
this
case
and
that
is
lisker
vs.
kelley
which
was
affirmed
just
last
year,
401
u.s.
928.
that
case
involved
candidates
and
the
use
of
a
candidate’s
oath.
that
oath
was
found
proper
in
that
case.
in
summation,
i
urged
that
the
court
approve
defining
a
decision
of
the
district
court,
i
believe
that
the
interest
of
the
state
in
self-preservation
are
sufficient
to
require
this
party
oath.
we
believe
that
the
grounded
decision
is
still
the
law
of
the
land
and
is
controlling
in
this
case.
i
thank
the
court
very
much,
mr.
chief
justice.
