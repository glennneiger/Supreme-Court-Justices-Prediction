justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
the
interest
of
the
state?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then,
if
i
understand
in
correctly,
it
is
not
this
man
will
hold
office,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
even
if
the
man
is
the
most
loyal
citizen
in
the
world,
and
he
wants
to
run
on
that
label,
he
can’t.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
my
point
is
that,
a
man
who
is
not
a
member
of
this
party
and
who
does
not
advocate
anything
but
good,
solid
americanism
close-motherhood
who
wants
to
run
on
that
label,
he
can
not.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
could
he,
if
they
do
not
file
the
affidavit?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
is
no
way
that
they
can
run,
unless
they
filed
the
affidavit.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
the
interest
that
ohio
has
in
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)if
loyal
party
has
talked
about?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
am
still
trying
to
find
out,
what
is
the
interest
in
the
state
in
not
letting
the
party
use
his
name
on
a
ballot?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
if
before
he
is
not
let
the
men
have
the
name
on
the
ballot?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
you
can
keep
them
out
by
the
oath.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
the
interest
in
not
letting
him
run?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
he
not
having
the
party
label
on
the
ballot,
does
it
contaminate
the
ballot
or
something?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
what’s
the
reason
for
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
feel
any
responsibility
of
the
assistant
attorney
general
of
ohio
to
give
to
this
court
a
reason
that
the
state
has
for
the
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
have
any
responsibility
for
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
all
i
am
asking.
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
question
is,
what
is
the
state’s
interest
in
enforcing
this
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
isn’t
an
affidavit
presumed
to
be
true?
if
not,
why
do
you
have
and
affidavit?
i
don’t
see
how
this
material
in
this
case
goes?
