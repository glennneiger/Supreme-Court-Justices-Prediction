unknown
speaker
you
certainly
are
not
suggesting
that
in
the
absence
of
the
exception,
they
couldn’t
get
on
the
ballot
of
this?
unknown
speaker
this
wasn’t
a
three-judge
district
court,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
not
when
i
gather
mr.
rosen,
you
don’t
extend
your
overbreadth
argument
to
either
elements
one
or
two
of
the
district
court’s
construction.
unknown
speaker
i
don’t
think
they
alleged
that,
do
they?
unknown
speaker
the
case
is
kind
of
a
search
and
destroy
of
the
complaint
lead.
here
is
the
statute
on
the
--
unknown
speaker
--
and
brought
some
of
the
ohio
general
code
and
we
do
not
like,
so
that
is
about
what
they
said.
unknown
speaker
i’m
not
going
to
say
more
than
that.
they
say
it’s
unconstitutional.
unknown
speaker
but
they
do
not
say
how
they
are
harmed?
unknown
speaker
i
don’t
see
anything
in
the
oath
that
says
that.
i
mean
in
this
thing,
this
says
that.
but
i
guess
it’s
the
best
you
can
do.
unknown
speaker
mr.
rosen,
may
i
ask
you
a
question.
justice
stewart
asked
mr.
guittar
as
to
the
steps
that
the
party
had
actually
taken
to
get
on
the
ballot
on
ohio.
i
know
it
as
they
pointed
out
in
david's
file
in
connection
with
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
that
i
don’t
find
in
the
appendix.
did
those
affidavits
make
an
offer
in
the
institutional
information
other
than
the
pleadings
this
court
has
been
done
by
the
party
towards
getting
on
the
ballot?
unknown
speaker
are
they
in
the
position
to
challenge
the
ones
they
can
test
until
they’ve
complied
with
the
ones
that
they
do(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
mean
to
comply
with
the
oath,
but
i
mean
to
comply
with
presumably,
administerial
type
of
filing
regulation
that
may
existed
that
you
do
not
quarrel.
unknown
speaker
was
there
any
allegation
in
the
complaint
or
in
the
affidavits
of
the
party
that
your
clients
would
refuse
to
execute
the
affidavit?
unknown
speaker
mr.
rosen,
except
for
what
is
the
affidavits
may
contain,
all
we
have,
as
i
understand
it,
is
paragraphs
18,
19,
20
and
21
appearing
on
page
12,
13
and
14
of
the
appendix,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
after
in
which
19
is
submitted
and
20
and
21
are
denied.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
gather
you
don’t
prefer,
you
prefer
not
to
sign
a
loyalty
oath
or
to
subject
yourself
to
investigation.
that
is
because
you
don’t
like
it
or
would
it
be
like,
do
you
allege
this
is
going
to
chill
you
in
some
way.
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
affidavit?
unknown
speaker
if
i
am
not
mistaken,
the
loyalty
of
the
cases
involved
people
who
refused
to
sign
a
loyalty
oath,
didn’t
they?
unknown
speaker
and
there’s
no
such
allegation
here.
unknown
speaker
but
surely,
a
person
can’t
just
sit
down
when
this
law
has
been
some
through
the
code
of
laws
of
the
state
and
final
end,
that
he
thinks
it
is
unconstitutional
and
bring
at
our
suit
in
attacking
it,
can
he?
he
has
to
show
somewhere
or
another
that
he’s
hurt
by
it.
unknown
speaker
but
i
don’t
see
what
does
has
to
do
with
--
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
not
asking
you
about
the
context.
it
is
just
these
three
paragraphs.
unknown
speaker
the
context
to
this
claim,
the
three
--
unknown
speaker
because
whatever
the
affidavits
may
show?
unknown
speaker
no
one
is
making
to
file
a
piece
of
paper
in
the
district
court
the
brief
here,
and
then
we
go
and
limit
to
record
to
find
out
what
the
case
is
all
about?
unknown
speaker
well,
at
least
we
have
to
go
and
file
an
affidavit,
don’t
we?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
we
had
to
look
for
that?
unknown
speaker
i
will
do
it
for
you.[laughter]
unknown
speaker
you
certainly
are
not
suggesting
that
