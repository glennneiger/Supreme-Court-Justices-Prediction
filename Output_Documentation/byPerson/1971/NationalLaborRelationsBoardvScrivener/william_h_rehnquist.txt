excuse
me,
mr.
bray.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
the
second
ground,
your
brief
at
page
17
state
that
the
guarantee
under
8
(a)
(1)
includes
the
right
of
employees
to
participate
in
administrative
proceedings
of
prior
practices
of
the
board.
i
did
not
see
any
cases
cited
for
that
proposition
in
your
brief.
is
this
just
to
be
taken
as
an
assertion
or
are
there
cases
that
support
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
would
find
it
helpful
mr.
bray
in
following
up
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
blackmuns
question,
if
you
could
tell
us
how
you
reached
that
result
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction?
perhaps
you
are
just
going
to
get
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
how
as
matter
of
english
usage,
i
mean,
is
it
by
a
broad
reading
of
the
word
testimony?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
that
it
is
the
case,
why
do
you
need
a
separate
protection
for
filing
charges?
would
it
not
just
a
giving
of
testimony
be
broad
enough
to
cover
filing
charges
if
your
construction
is
right?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because
the
board
practice
normally,
when
you
are
contemplating
appellees
to
have
a
deposition
along
the
lines
provided
from
the
rules
of
civil
procedure?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then
supposing
that
the
witness
who
gave
the
affidavit
does
not
show
up
at
the
hearing
which
i
presume
the
question
mr.
justice
brennan
asked,
is
the
affidavit
then
admissible?
justice
william
