mr.
william
terry
bray
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
a
labor
board
determination
of
unfair
labor
practices
against
an
employer
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
in
this
court,
only
a
single
issue
is
presented.
whether
the
employer
by
discharge
of
certain
of
his
employees
because
they
had
given
sworn
statements
when
meeting
with
a
board
agent
who
was
investigating
unfair
labor
practice
charges
against
the
employer,
violated
section
8
(a)
(4)
or
section
8
(a)
(1)
of
the
act
by
virtue
of
the
discharges.
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes,
they
are.
we
consider
them
independent.
the
board
held
that
they
were
independent
and
we
have
all
along
presented
them
as
independent
grounds
for
upholding
the
decision
of
the
board.
mr.
william
terry
bray
do
we
have
any
preference?
we
would
like
for
the
court
to
find
for
the
board
on
both
grounds.
we
have
no
preferences
to
which
ground,
if
the
court
chooses
to
go
on
one
or
the
other.
mr.
william
terry
bray
we
think
that
there
are
strong
arguments
supporting
either
ground.
i
would
be
reluctant
to
say
that
our
arguments
are
more
strong
on
one
ground
than
the
other.
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes
sir.
mr.
william
terry
bray
no,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
cases
which
we
cited
at
page
18
of
our
brief
make
this
abundantly
clear
and
these
are
quoted
at
the
top
of
page
18
from
the
oil
city
brass
works
case
is
squarely
in
point
on
this.
the
court
there
did
hold
that
the
section
7
guarantees
of
the
employees
include
the
right,
not
only
of
employees
to
participate,
but
to
have
others
participate
on
their
behalf
and
that
employer
discrimination
on
account
of
participation
in
board
proceedings
infringe
the
employees'
grantees
under
section
7
and
thus
violated
section
8
(a)
(1).
the
board
in
this
case
found
that
the
discharges
violated
both
section
8
(a)
(4)
and
section
8
(a)
(1).
the
court
of
appeals
refused,
however,
to
sustain
the
board
on
either
ground.
on
the
section
8
(a)
(4)
basis,
the
court
relied
on
its
earlier
decision
in
the
ritchie
case
and
concluded
that
the
section
8
(a)
(4)
covered
only
the
precise
matters
stated
in
that
section,
that
is
actually
giving
testimony
in
a
formal
board
hearing
or
filing
charges
with
the
board.
with
respect
to
section
8
(a)
(1),
the
court
concluded
that
it
could
not
uphold
an
independent
violation
of
that
section
because
to
do
so
would
be
implicitly
to
overrule
its
decision
in
the
ritchie
case
and
it
was
unwilling
to
do
so.
we
think
that
the
court
erred
on
both
grounds.
with
respect
to
the
factual
setting,
the
court
of
appeals
accepted
for
purposes
of
the
legal
question
involved
and
which
we
have
presented
here,
the
findings
of
the
examiner
as
sustained
by
the
board.
while
respondents
have
taken
issue
with
our
statement
of
the
case
and
indeed
have
restated
the
case
in
their
brief
that
essentially
is
a
result
of
their
view
of
the
record
evidence
and
what
the
record
evidence
--
evidence
showed.
and
their
view
of
the
case
was
not
sustained
by
the
examiner
or
by
the
board,
and
as
i
say,
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
questions
are
not
here,
they
were
not
considered
by
the
court
below,
we
instead
are
relying
on
what
the
examiner
found
and
the
board
sustained.
on
that
basis,
the
examiner?s
decision
is
set
out
in
full
at
pages
216
through
249
of
the
appendix
and
shows
that
the
unfair
labor
practices
here
arose
out
of
an
organizational
campaign
among
respondents
employees
during
the
spring
of
1968.
the
respondent
is
a
sole
proprietor
engaged
in
the
electrical
contracting
business
in
springfield,
missouri.
on
march
18,
1968,
five
of
his
six
employees
signed
authorization
cards
for
the
electrical
workers
union.
respondent
was
notified
of
this
the
next
day
and
upon
this
notification,
he
refused
to
bargain
with
the
union
and
later
during
the
day
complained
to
his
employees
about
their
activities.
several
days
later,
he
discharged
three
of
the
card-signers
and
on
the
same
day
hired
two
new
employees
who
were
not
affiliated
with
the
union.
the
next
day,
march
21,
the
union
filed
unfair
labor
practice
charges
regarding
the
discharge
of
the
three
employees
on
march
20.
subsequently,
the
dischargees
were
reemployed
and
were
working
for
the
company
when
on
april
17,
the
board
field
examiner
called
on
mr.
scrivener
to
discuss
the
charges
filed
against
him.
that
evening,
the
field
examiner
met
with
the
five
card-signers
to
discuss
the
unfair
labor
practice
charges
and
received
written
statements
from
them.
the
next
day,
mr.
scrivener
questioned
the
four
card-signers
who
were
still
in
his
employ
about
their
meeting
with
the
examiner
and
that
afternoon,
he
dismissed
all
four
of
them
purportedly
because
there
was
not
enough
work
for
them
to
do.
the
examiner
found
that
this
was
not
the
real
reason
for
the
discharges
and
that
instead,
the
dismissals
were
because
these
employees
had
met
with
and
given
sworn
written
statements
to
the
board
examiner.
he
held
that
a
discharge
on
this
ground
violated
both
section
8
(a)
(4)
and
section
8
(a)
(1)
of
the
act.
mr.
scrivener
urged
that
he
was
not
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
board.
the
evidence
taken
before
the
examiner
showed
that
indeed
mr.
scrivener
did
not
meet
the
boards
discretionary
jurisdictional
standard,
but
that
it
did
meet
the
statutory
standard
of
affecting
commerce.
this
was
shown
by
evidence
indicating
that
mr.
scrivener
purchased
something
in
excess
of
$20,000.00
of
goods
in
interstate
commerce
during
1967
and
a
projected
sales
from
a
single
source
to
1968
were
in
excess
of
$30,000.00.
thus
the
board,
i
beg
your
pardon,
the
examiner
found
that
statutory
jurisdiction
was
met
and
because
of
the
nature
of
the
discharges
for
having
giving
a
statement
to
the
examiner
--
to
the
examiner
then
the
trial
examiner
concluded
that
public
policy
required
that
the
board
assert
its
statutory
jurisdiction
to
protect
participants
in
board
proceedings.
because
the
jurisdiction
would
be
asserted
on
this
ground,
the
examiner
also
went
ahead
to
consider
other
unfair
labor
practice
charges,
found
that
those
unfair
labor
practices
had
occurred
and
recommended
that
the
board
also
remedy
them.
the
board
agreed
with
the
examiner
that
statutory
jurisdiction
was
shown
and
that
public
policy
required
its
exercise
of
jurisdiction
to
protect
the
employees
who
had
been
discharged
on
the
ground
that
they
had
given
a
statement
to
that
board
field
agent.
the
board
held,
however,
that
the
other
unrelated
unfair
labor
practice
charges
were
not
something
over
which
they
should
assert
jurisdiction
on
public
policy
grounds
and
thus
the
board
dismissed
them.
we
think
that
the
discharges
here,
raised
as
they
were,
under
the
facts
as
they
come
to
this
court,
solely
on
the
fact
that
these
employees
met
with
and
gave
statements
to
a
board
field
agent
investigating
unfair
labor
practice
charges
against
their
employer,
clearly
come
within
the
protections
of
section
8
(a)
(4)
and
also
within
the
protection
of
section
8
(a)
(1).
we
think
that
the
court
below
erred
on
both
grounds
in
not
sustaining
the
boards
order.
section
8
(a)
(4)
bars
discrimination
against
any
employee
by
his
employer
because
he
has
filed
charges
or
given
testimony
under
the
act.
it
is
our
submission
that
this
provision
protects
not
only
the
matters
precisely
stated,
that
is
the
filing
charges
and
testifying,
but
also
the
sort
of
in
between
actions
involved
here,
giving
sworn
statements
to
a
board
agent
during
the
course
of
investigation
of
unfair
labor
practice
charges
that
had
been
earlier
found.
mr.
william
terry
bray
that
is
the
only
thing
that
we
need,
mr.
justice
blackmun
for
purposes
of
our
case
here.
the
boards
position
is
that
section
8
(a)
(4)
offers
broad
protection
for
any
participation
in
a
board
proceeding.
that
need
not
be
decided
however
in
order
to
sustain
holding
in
this
case
since
here
the
employees
who
were
discharged
had
given
written
statements
to
the
examiner.
and
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
pardon
me?
mr.
william
terry
bray
our
basic
submission
is
that
section
8
(a)
(4)
should
be
construed
to
protect
this
sort
of
activity
at
the
least.
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes
sir,
i
think
that
not
only
is
this
construction
in
full
accord
with
the
obvious
intent
of
the
section
and
the
legislative
history
behind
it
as
well
as
with
the
boards
longstanding
view
of
the
section,
but
also
substantial
policy
reasons.
mr.
william
terry
bray
that
is
precisely
it
mr.
justice.
we
think
that
testimony
had
in
the
context
and
which
it
occurs
here
and
in
the
context
of
the
development
of
this
section
itself
indicates
not
just
testifying
at
a
formal
board
hearing,
but
more
broadly
the
giving
of
information
to
a
board
agent
at
anytime
during
a
board
proceeding.
mr.
william
terry
bray
alright
suppose
it
could
be,
although
the
filing
of
charges
is
not
the
actual
discussing
the
charges
after
they
have
been
filed
with
the
board
which
we
think
testifying
covers.
the
proceedings
from
the
time
of
charge
is
filed
which
triggers
the
boards
participation
in
the
charge
would
then
be
protected
by
section
8
(a)
(4)
under
the
testifying.
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes
sir,
they
were.
mr.
william
terry
bray
it
is
my
understanding
they
would
not.
mr.
william
terry
bray
not
necessarily
with
the
particular
witness
who
gave
it.
perhaps
some
other
witness
could
have
provided
the
necessary
basis
for
the
introduction.
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes
sir.
now
the
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
in
terms
of
putting
them
into
evidence?
mr.
william
terry
bray
in
general
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
govern
in
board
proceedings.
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes
sir,
and
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
affidavits
would
not
ordinarily
had
been
admissible
into
evidence
as
such.
indeed,
the
only
affidavit
that
was
actually
introduced
into
evidence
was
introduced
to
clarify
some
of
the
testimony
given
by
one
of
the
appellants
which
was
considerably
different
from
his
affidavit.
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes,
certainly
they
would
have
been
and
indeed
this
is
standard
board
procedure
and
board
rule
that
if
a
witness
testifies
at
a
hearing,
any
statements
he
has
given
to
the
board
are
then
available
for
cross-examination
purposes.
mr.
william
terry
bray
no,
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
board
practice
is
more
along
the
lines
of
what
happened
here.
the
field
agent
obtains
in
the
field
a
statement
from
the
employees
of
what
transpired
with
respect
to
the
matters
that
he
is
investigating.
he
then
puts
that
in
writing
and
has
the
agent,
i
beg
your
pardon,
has
the
employee
or
whoever
is
giving
the
statement
sign
and
swear
to
it
before
him
and
this
is
the
only
preparation
in
terms
of
having
something
in
writing
that
goes
on
before
the
hearing
begins.
mr.
william
terry
bray
i
frankly
do
not
know.
it
is
my
understanding,
of
course
the
board
could
subpoena
the
witness
to
have
him
come
and
it
has
broad
powers
to
do
this.
mr.
william
terry
bray
precisely
and
indeed
the
rule
specifically
provides
for
deposition
although
that
is
not
the
usual
procedure
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
it's
my
submission
that
not
only
is
it
incidental
to
it,
but
indeed
testifying
is
that
word
is
used
in
section
8
(a)
(4)
is
broad
enough
in
context
to
include
all
of
the
proceedings
for
board
agents
from
the
time
the
charge
is
filed
until
such
time
as
the
hearing
actually
gets
underway.
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes
sir.
let
me
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
that
is
our
submission.
that
was
predecessor
provision.
that
was
the
language
of
the
predecessor
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
precisely,
and
at
the
time
section
8
(a)
(4)
was
enacted
and
it
is
supplanted
this
executive
order,
not
only
did
congress
not
indicate
any
intent
to
narrow
protections
offered,
but
the
senate
memorandum
quoted
in
our
brief
indicated
that
section
8
(a)
(4)
was
intended
as
a
mere
reiteration
of
the
executive
order
and
thus
it
is
our
submission
that
8
(a)
(4)
like
its
predecessor
covers
any
giving
of
evidence
and
certainly
the
giving
of
sworn
statements
such
as
here.
further,
this
comports
with
the
clear
legislative
purpose
behind
the
section
as
this
court
explained
to
that
purpose
in
nash
versus
florida
industrial
commission.
there
the
court
stated
that
congress
by
enacting
section
8
(a)
(4)
has
made
clear
that
it
wishes
all
persons
with
information
about
unfair
labor
practices
to
be
completely
free
from
any
employer
coercion
against
reporting
them
to
the
board.
the
reason
that
this
type
of
protection
is
necessary
is
well
stated
in
the
john
hancock
case,
also
cited
in
our
brief
and
from
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
these
protections
must
be
available
in
order
to
prevent
the
boards
challenge
of
information
from
being
brought
up
by
employer
intimidation.
the
basic
aim
was
to
keep
free
and
unimpeded
the
channels
of
communications
between
both
the
board
on
the
one
hand
and
the
participants
in
its
proceedings
on
the
other
and
to
dispel
any
fear
by
the
participants
that
by
assisting
the
board
in
its
investigation,
they
might
be
subjected
to
employer
reprisals.
preliminary
preparations,
including
the
taking
of
sworn
statements
such
as
here,
are
every
bit
as
essential
to
an
effective
board
proceeding
as
are
the
filing
of
charges
and
the
actual
giving
of
testimony
in
a
formal
board
hearing
and
thus
should
be
included
within
the
scope
of
this
section.
as
i
have
indicated,
this
interpretation
for
which
we
urge
is
highly
consistent
with
the
legislative
history
of
this
provision.
it
--
certainly
under
the
executive
order,
under
the
national
industrial
recovery
act
this
type
of
statement
would
have
been
protected
in
congress
when
it
was
replaced
the
executive
order
with
section
8
(a)
(4),
indicated
that
it
did
not
intend
to
change
the
coverage
of
protection
afforded.
mr.
william
terry
bray
certainly,
with
respect
to
the
eighth
circuit,
yes
sir.
mr.
william
terry
bray
it
was
not
my
knowledge.
there
is
no
certain
history
on
it
in
the
citing.
mr.
william
terry
bray
other
than
the
fact
that
in
that
case,
i
certainly
know
one
reason
why
and
the
reason
i
think
it's
certainly
a
fact.
in
that
case,
the
board
had
found
that
the
discharge
involved
violated
other
sections
of
the
acts,
specifically
sections
8
(a)
(1)
and
8
(a)
(3).
the
court
of
appeals
had
no
difficulty
in
sustaining
the
order
with
respect
to
those
two
sections
and
it
held
that
it
was
reluctant
to
enforce
section
8
(a)
(4)
in
the
circumstances
of
the
case.
obviously,
we
had
the
same
relief
that
we
would
have
had
even
if
section
8
(a)
(4)
had
been
enforced
because
that
was
not
the
type
of
case
that
we
needed
to
bring
to
this
court.
here
on
the
other
hand,
the
court
has
refused
to
give
these
employees
any
relief
from
what
we
consider
to
be
obvious
unfair
labor
practices
and
we
think
too
that
the
board
correctly
asserted
jurisdiction
in
this
context.
mr.
william
terry
bray
that
is
correct,
yes
sir.
mr.
william
terry
bray
it
may
well
had
been
denied
for
administrative
reasons.
mr.
william
terry
bray
that
is
right.
this
view
also
is
consistent
with
longstanding
board
interpretation
of
section
8
(a)
(4).
the
board
has
not
always
invoked
section
8
(a)
(4)
when
other
violations
are
involved
and
the
remedies
for
those
other
violations
would
be
the
same
as
the
remedies
under
section
8
(a)
(4).
indeed,
we
think
that
explains
the
overprotective
service
company
case
on
which
respondents
rely
and
in
which
the
board
merely
adopted
its
examiners
finding
that
it
would
not
invoke
an
8
(a)
(4)
violation
pro
forma
and
without
considering
the
matter.
where
the
board
has
given
detailed
consideration
to
the
issue,
it
has
uniformly
held
at
section
8
(a)
(4)
is
violated
when
an
employer
makes
discharges
because
of
participating
in
board
proceedings.
the
practicalities
of
agency
action
also
demand
this
result.
a
participant
in
a
board
proceeding
often
does
not
actually
file
charges
or
testify.
he
may
not
testify
because
his
testimony
is
cumulative
as
happened
in
the
dal-tex
case
or
because
the
cases
settled
or
dismissed
before
it
gets
to
hearing
which
happens
in
over
90%
of
the
boards
cases
according
to
its
35th
annual
report
or
the
situation
may
be
as
it
was
here,
the
employer
discharges
his
employees
immediately
upon
learning
of
their
assistance
to
the
board
and
before
any
hearing
could
possibly
have
started.
if
no
protection
is
afforded
for
participants
in
these
situations
and
we
think
it
is
obvious
that
the
participants
will
be
much
less
willing
to
assist
in
board
proceedings
and
that
this
will
impair
the
board
in
its
investigative
and
other
statutory
efforts.
finally,
several
courts
of
appeals
had
agreed
with
our
view
of
section
8
(a)
(4),
specifically
the
fifth
circuit
has
twice
sustained
board
orders
finding
section
8
(a)
(4)
violation
in
essentially
similar
context
as
that
presented
here.
the
m
&
s
steel
company
case
on
page
16
of
our
brief
as
well
as
the
dal-tex
optical
company
case
on
that
same
page
involved
section
8
(a)
(4)
violations
where
the
employee
was
discriminated
against
either
for
giving
statements
through
a
board
agent
or
for
appearing
at
a
board
hearing,
but
not
actually
testifying.
the
cases
cited
at
note
11
of
our
brief
on
page
16
indicate
that
other
courts
of
appeals
had
also
broadly
read
section
8
(a)
(4)
to
protect
participants
in
board
proceedings
in
context
other
than
merely
filing
charges
or
testifying.
finally,
the
subpoena
powers
under
section
11
support
our
view.
as
i
indicated,
the
board
could
have
subpoenaed
these
men
to
give
the
statements
which
they
gave
the
agent,
had
they
not
done
so
willingly.
in
that
event,
the
second
circuit
has
held
that
the
board
must
assert
jurisdiction
to
protect
the
participants
in
board
proceedings.
it
cannot
decline
to
assert
jurisdiction
in
that
circumstance.
while
the
employees
here
gave
their
statements
willingly,
we
think
this
should
be
encouraged,
not
discouraged,
and
that
there
is
no
sound
reason
for
denying
equal
protections
to
the
voluntary
participant
as
to
those
who
appear
under
subpoena.
turning
to
section
8
(a)
(1),
it
was
the
boards
position
and
it
is
our
position
here
that
the
discharges
on
the
grounds
which
the
examiner
found,
independently
violated
section
8
(a)
(1).
we
do
not
think
that
the
court
below
gave
any
significant
consideration
to
this
issue
and
instead
rushed
it
off
with
the
explanation
that
to
uphold
an
independent
8
(a)
(1)
violation
would
be
implicitly
to
overrule
ritchie,
even
though
ritchie
involved
only
section
8
(a)
(4).
it
is
our
position
that
these
discharges
are
clearly
barred
by
section
8
(a)
(1).
that
section
prohibits
employer
conduct
that
interferes
with,
restrains
or
coerces
employees
in
the
exercise
of
rights
guaranteed
by
section
7.
section
7
in
turn
assures
broadly
that
employee
shall
have
the
right
to
inform,
join
or
assist
labor
organizations
and
to
engage
in
other
concerted
activities
for
purpose
of
collective
bargaining
or
other
mutual
aid
or
protection.
the
board
and
various
courts
of
appeals
have
repeatedly
held
that
section
7
-
that
the
section
7
guarantees
include
the
right
to
participate
and
given
information
in
board
proceedings
as
well
as
the
right
to
have
others
do
the
same
without
fear
of
being
penalized
by
an
employer
for
having
done
so.
as
i
mentioned,
the
oil
city
brass
works
case
as
well
as
the
other
cases
on
page
18
of
our
brief
established
this
proposition.
further,
it
is
well
established
that
employer
discrimination
because
of
participating
in
the
board
proceedings
or
because
of
doing
so
on
behalf
of
others,
unlawfully
restrains
rank
and
file
employees
in
the
free
exercise
of
their
section
7
rights
and
thus
violates
section
8
(a)
(1).
indeed
the
fifth
circuit
has
gone
so
far
as
to
hold
that
this
is
an
8
(a)
(1)
violation
as
a
matter
of
law.
several
courts
of
appeals'
cases
involved
quite
similar
circumstances
to
those
here.
the
electro
motive
company
case
at
pages
18
and
19
of
our
brief
from
the
fourth
circuit
held
that
an
employer
discharge
of
a
board
participant
for
having
given
a
board
agent
a
statement,
precisely
the
circumstances
here,
violated
section
8
(a)
(1).
the
southland
paint
case
from
the
fifth
circuit
similarly
held
that
the
discharge
of
a
participant
because
he
testified
in
a
board
hearing
and
because
he
gave
an
affidavit
to
a
board
agent
violated
section
8
(a)
(1).
in
this
latter
case,
the
fifth
circuit
said
that
an
affidavit
given
in
a
board
proceeding
is
essentially
the
equivalent
of
testifying
in
a
board
hearing.
while
both
these
cases
involved
the
discharge
of
a
supervisor,
yet
we
think
the
present
case
is
even
a
stronger
one
for
invoking
the
protections
of
section
8
(a)
(1).
supervisors
generally
are
excluded
from
the
protections
of
the
act
and
yet
in
those
cases,
the
courts
found
that
they
must
be
protected
in
order
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
rank
and
file
employees
to
an
effective
board
proceeding.
it
seems
to
us
to
follow
that
certainly
where
an
employee
himself
who
is
protected
by
the
act
participates
in
a
board
proceeding
and
then
he
is
discharged
for
having
done
so,
the
circumstances
here,
that
section
8
(a)
(1)
has
been
violated
because
his
section
7
rights
had
been
infringed.
the
texas
industries
case
set
forth
at
page
19
of
our
brief
also
supports
our
view
of
section
8
(a)
(1).
there
the
fifth
circuit
upheld
the
board
finding
that
merely
asking
employees
about
statements
they
had
given
a
board
agent
and
for
copies
of
those
statements
violated
section
8
(a)
(1).
we
think
again
that
the
present
case
where
the
employer
goes
much
further
and
discharges
the
employees
because
they
had
done
so
is
even
more
appropriate
for
invoking
the
section
8
(a)
(1)
protections.
the
reasons
that
we
have
stated
with
respect
to
section
8
(a)
(4),
also
many
of
those
apply
to
support
our
construction
of
section
8
(a)
(1).
the
legislative
purpose
of
protecting
all
board
participants
and
assuring
that
all
persons
with
information
about
unfair
labor
practices
are
free
to
come
before
the
board,
certainly
justifies
this
construction.
moreover,
the
practicalities
of
agency
practice
and
the
fact
that
many
participants
do
not
actually
testify
or
file
charges
supports
our
construction
of
8
(a)
(1)
in
order
to
assure
these
men
that
they
will
be
protected
from
discharge
for
having
come
before
the
board.
lastly,
this
has
been
the
consistent
board
construction
of
section
8
(a)
(1)
over
many
years
and
this
is
entitled
to
weight.
the
section
11
subpoena
powers
also
support
this
view.
as
i
have
explained
the
employees
could
have
been
subpoenaed
to
give
the
statements
and
had
they
done
so,
it
is
also
clear
that
the
section
8
(a)
(1)
protections
are
as
broad
as
the
section
11
subpoena
powers.
mr.
william
terry
bray
with
respect
to
whether
the
type
of
activity
here
involved
is
included
within
section
7,
yes,
but
we
think
that
that
is
clear.
there
had
been
numerable
holdings
to
that
effect
and
we
do
not
understand
the
eighth
circuit
to
have
denied
enforcement
of
our
order
here
on
the
grounds
that
this
type
of
activity
is
not
protected
activity
under
section
7.
mr.
william
terry
bray
the
right
of
employees
--
the
general
right
of
employees
to
engage
in
concerted
activity
is
or
includes
the
right
to
invoke
and
have
an
effective
board
proceeding
to
protect
those
rights.
this
has
been
held
in
all
of
the
cases
cited
in
our
brief
and
we
think
it
is
well
established
that
right
is
infringed
when
a
participant
in
a
board
proceeding
is
discharged
because
of
having
done
so.
as
i
say
judge
reese
of
the
fifth
circuit
concluded
that
a
discharge
on
this
ground
violated
section
8
(a)
(1)
rights
as
a
matter
of
law.
had
these
employees
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
well,
it
is
redundant
if
you
accept
my
construction
of
section
8
(a)
(4),
but
there
is
no
problem
there
because
it
is
clearly
established
that
the
same
activity
can
violate
one
or
all
of
the
sections
of
the
act,
it
need
not
violate
just
one.
had
these
employees
been
subpoenaed
as
i
say,
it
is
clear
that
they
would
have
been
protected.
further,
the
mere
fact
that
these
employees
appeared
voluntarily
rather
than
pursuant
to
a
subpoena
is
not
any
ground
for
denying
them
similar
protections
and
indeed
the
fourth
circuit
in
the
electro
motive
company
case
showed
that
this
had
to
be
so
because
the
effect
on
the
protected
rights
is
precisely
the
same
whether
or
not
the
participant
has
been
subpoenaed
and
the
court
in
that
case
held
that
it
did
not
make
any
difference
whether
or
not
(voice
overlap).
mr.
william
terry
bray
if
we
had
one
employee
involved
and
he
was
engaged
in
union
activities,
yes,
we
would
argue
that
this
was
a
protective
right
under
section
7.
in
other
words,
i
think
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
i
think
that
--
reading,
if
i
may
the
language
of
section
8
(a)
(1),
it
could
be
within
a
number
of
the
protections
of
section
8
(a)
(1).
it
need
not
be
just
in
the
concerted
activity.
mr.
william
terry
bray
i
beg
your
pardon.
section
7.
it
could
be
within
a
number
to
the
provision
of
section
7.
(voice
overlap)
let
me
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
i
am
sorry
i
do
not
have
the
language
of
the
section,
your
honor.
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes
sir.
mr.
william
terry
bray
thank
you.
mr.
william
terry
bray
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
a
labor
board
determination
of
unfair
labor
practices
against
an
employer
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
in
this
court,
only
a
single
issue
is
presented.
whether
the
employer
by
discharge
of
certain
of
his
employees
because
they
had
given
sworn
statements
when
meeting
with
a
board
agent
who
was
investigating
unfair
labor
practice
charges
against
the
employer,
violated
section
8
(a)
(4)
or
section
8
(a)
(1)
of
the
act
by
virtue
of
the
discharges.
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes,
they
are.
we
consider
them
independent.
the
board
held
that
they
were
independent
and
we
have
all
along
presented
them
as
independent
grounds
for
upholding
the
decision
of
the
board.
mr.
william
terry
bray
do
we
have
any
preference?
we
would
like
for
the
court
to
find
for
the
board
on
both
grounds.
we
have
no
preferences
to
which
ground,
if
the
court
chooses
to
go
on
one
or
the
other.
mr.
william
terry
bray
we
think
that
there
are
strong
arguments
supporting
either
ground.
i
would
be
reluctant
to
say
that
our
arguments
are
more
strong
on
one
ground
than
the
other.
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes
sir.
mr.
william
terry
bray
no,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
cases
which
we
cited
at
page
18
of
our
brief
make
this
abundantly
clear
and
these
are
quoted
at
the
top
of
page
18
from
the
oil
city
brass
works
case
is
squarely
in
point
on
this.
the
court
there
did
hold
that
the
section
7
guarantees
of
the
employees
include
the
right,
not
only
of
employees
to
participate,
but
to
have
others
participate
on
their
behalf
and
that
employer
discrimination
on
account
of
participation
in
board
proceedings
infringe
the
employees'
grantees
under
section
7
and
thus
violated
section
8
(a)
(1).
the
board
in
this
case
found
that
the
discharges
violated
both
section
8
(a)
(4)
and
section
8
(a)
(1).
the
court
of
appeals
refused,
however,
to
sustain
the
board
on
either
ground.
on
the
section
8
(a)
(4)
basis,
the
court
relied
on
its
earlier
decision
in
the
ritchie
case
and
concluded
that
the
section
8
(a)
(4)
covered
only
the
precise
matters
stated
in
that
section,
that
is
actually
giving
testimony
in
a
formal
board
hearing
or
filing
charges
with
the
board.
with
respect
to
section
8
(a)
(1),
the
court
concluded
that
it
could
not
uphold
an
independent
violation
of
that
section
because
to
do
so
would
be
implicitly
to
overrule
its
decision
in
the
ritchie
case
and
it
was
unwilling
to
do
so.
we
think
that
the
court
erred
on
both
grounds.
with
respect
to
the
factual
setting,
the
court
of
appeals
accepted
for
purposes
of
the
legal
question
involved
and
which
we
have
presented
here,
the
findings
of
the
examiner
as
sustained
by
the
board.
while
respondents
have
taken
issue
with
our
statement
of
the
case
and
indeed
have
restated
the
case
in
their
brief
that
essentially
is
a
result
of
their
view
of
the
record
evidence
and
what
the
record
evidence
--
evidence
showed.
and
their
view
of
the
case
was
not
sustained
by
the
examiner
or
by
the
board,
and
as
i
say,
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
questions
are
not
here,
they
were
not
considered
by
the
court
below,
we
instead
are
relying
on
what
the
examiner
found
and
the
board
sustained.
on
that
basis,
the
examiner?s
decision
is
set
out
in
full
at
pages
216
through
249
of
the
appendix
and
shows
that
the
unfair
labor
practices
here
arose
out
of
an
organizational
campaign
among
respondents
employees
during
the
spring
of
1968.
the
respondent
is
a
sole
proprietor
engaged
in
the
electrical
contracting
business
in
springfield,
missouri.
on
march
18,
1968,
five
of
his
six
employees
signed
authorization
cards
for
the
electrical
workers
union.
respondent
was
notified
of
this
the
next
day
and
upon
this
notification,
he
refused
to
bargain
with
the
union
and
later
during
the
day
complained
to
his
employees
about
their
activities.
several
days
later,
he
discharged
three
of
the
card-signers
and
on
the
same
day
hired
two
new
employees
who
were
not
affiliated
with
the
union.
the
next
day,
march
21,
the
union
filed
unfair
labor
practice
charges
regarding
the
discharge
of
the
three
employees
on
march
20.
subsequently,
the
dischargees
were
reemployed
and
were
working
for
the
company
when
on
april
17,
the
board
field
examiner
called
on
mr.
scrivener
to
discuss
the
charges
filed
against
him.
that
evening,
the
field
examiner
met
with
the
five
card-signers
to
discuss
the
unfair
labor
practice
charges
and
received
written
statements
from
them.
the
next
day,
mr.
scrivener
questioned
the
four
card-signers
who
were
still
in
his
employ
about
their
meeting
with
the
examiner
and
that
afternoon,
he
dismissed
all
four
of
them
purportedly
because
there
was
not
enough
work
for
them
to
do.
the
examiner
found
that
this
was
not
the
real
reason
for
the
discharges
and
that
instead,
the
dismissals
were
because
these
employees
had
met
with
and
given
sworn
written
statements
to
the
board
examiner.
he
held
that
a
discharge
on
this
ground
violated
both
section
8
(a)
(4)
and
section
8
(a)
(1)
of
the
act.
mr.
scrivener
urged
that
he
was
not
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
board.
the
evidence
taken
before
the
examiner
showed
that
indeed
mr.
scrivener
did
not
meet
the
boards
discretionary
jurisdictional
standard,
but
that
it
did
meet
the
statutory
standard
of
affecting
commerce.
this
was
shown
by
evidence
indicating
that
mr.
scrivener
purchased
something
in
excess
of
$20,000.00
of
goods
in
interstate
commerce
during
1967
and
a
projected
sales
from
a
single
source
to
1968
were
in
excess
of
$30,000.00.
thus
the
board,
i
beg
your
pardon,
the
examiner
found
that
statutory
jurisdiction
was
met
and
because
of
the
nature
of
the
discharges
for
having
giving
a
statement
to
the
examiner
--
to
the
examiner
then
the
trial
examiner
concluded
that
public
policy
required
that
the
board
assert
its
statutory
jurisdiction
to
protect
participants
in
board
proceedings.
because
the
jurisdiction
would
be
asserted
on
this
ground,
the
examiner
also
went
ahead
to
consider
other
unfair
labor
practice
charges,
found
that
those
unfair
labor
practices
had
occurred
and
recommended
that
the
board
also
remedy
them.
the
board
agreed
with
the
examiner
that
statutory
jurisdiction
was
shown
and
that
public
policy
required
its
exercise
of
jurisdiction
to
protect
the
employees
who
had
been
discharged
on
the
ground
that
they
had
given
a
statement
to
that
board
field
agent.
the
board
held,
however,
that
the
other
unrelated
unfair
labor
practice
charges
were
not
something
over
which
they
should
assert
jurisdiction
on
public
policy
grounds
and
thus
the
board
dismissed
them.
we
think
that
the
discharges
here,
raised
as
they
were,
under
the
facts
as
they
come
to
this
court,
solely
on
the
fact
that
these
employees
met
with
and
gave
statements
to
a
board
field
agent
investigating
unfair
labor
practice
charges
against
their
employer,
clearly
come
within
the
protections
of
section
8
(a)
(4)
and
also
within
the
protection
of
section
8
(a)
(1).
we
think
that
the
court
below
erred
on
both
grounds
in
not
sustaining
the
boards
order.
section
8
(a)
(4)
bars
discrimination
against
any
employee
by
his
employer
because
he
has
filed
charges
or
given
testimony
under
the
act.
it
is
our
submission
that
this
provision
protects
not
only
the
matters
precisely
stated,
that
is
the
filing
charges
and
testifying,
but
also
the
sort
of
in
between
actions
involved
here,
giving
sworn
statements
to
a
board
agent
during
the
course
of
investigation
of
unfair
labor
practice
charges
that
had
been
earlier
found.
mr.
william
terry
bray
that
is
the
only
thing
that
we
need,
mr.
justice
blackmun
for
purposes
of
our
case
here.
the
boards
position
is
that
section
8
(a)
(4)
offers
broad
protection
for
any
participation
in
a
board
proceeding.
that
need
not
be
decided
however
in
order
to
sustain
holding
in
this
case
since
here
the
employees
who
were
discharged
had
given
written
statements
to
the
examiner.
and
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
pardon
me?
mr.
william
terry
bray
our
basic
submission
is
that
section
8
(a)
(4)
should
be
construed
to
protect
this
sort
of
activity
at
the
least.
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes
sir,
i
think
that
not
only
is
this
construction
in
full
accord
with
the
obvious
intent
of
the
section
and
the
legislative
history
behind
it
as
well
as
with
the
boards
longstanding
view
of
the
section,
but
also
substantial
policy
reasons.
mr.
william
terry
bray
that
is
precisely
it
mr.
justice.
we
think
that
testimony
had
in
the
context
and
which
it
occurs
here
and
in
the
context
of
the
development
of
this
section
itself
indicates
not
just
testifying
at
a
formal
board
hearing,
but
more
broadly
the
giving
of
information
to
a
board
agent
at
anytime
during
a
board
proceeding.
mr.
william
terry
bray
alright
suppose
it
could
be,
although
the
filing
of
charges
is
not
the
actual
discussing
the
charges
after
they
have
been
filed
with
the
board
which
we
think
testifying
covers.
the
proceedings
from
the
time
of
charge
is
filed
which
triggers
the
boards
participation
in
the
charge
would
then
be
protected
by
section
8
(a)
(4)
under
the
testifying.
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes
sir,
they
were.
mr.
william
terry
bray
it
is
my
understanding
they
would
not.
mr.
william
terry
bray
not
necessarily
with
the
particular
witness
who
gave
it.
perhaps
some
other
witness
could
have
provided
the
necessary
basis
for
the
introduction.
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes
sir.
now
the
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
in
terms
of
putting
them
into
evidence?
mr.
william
terry
bray
in
general
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
govern
in
board
proceedings.
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes
sir,
and
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
affidavits
would
not
ordinarily
had
been
admissible
into
evidence
as
such.
indeed,
the
only
affidavit
that
was
actually
introduced
into
evidence
was
introduced
to
clarify
some
of
the
testimony
given
by
one
of
the
appellants
which
was
considerably
different
from
his
affidavit.
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes,
certainly
they
would
have
been
and
indeed
this
is
standard
board
procedure
and
board
rule
that
if
a
witness
testifies
at
a
hearing,
any
statements
he
has
given
to
the
board
are
then
available
for
cross-examination
purposes.
mr.
william
terry
bray
no,
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
board
practice
is
more
along
the
lines
of
what
happened
here.
the
field
agent
obtains
in
the
field
a
statement
from
the
employees
of
what
transpired
with
respect
to
the
matters
that
he
is
investigating.
he
then
puts
that
in
writing
and
has
the
agent,
i
beg
your
pardon,
has
the
employee
or
whoever
is
giving
the
statement
sign
and
swear
to
it
before
him
and
this
is
the
only
preparation
in
terms
of
having
something
in
writing
that
goes
on
before
the
hearing
begins.
mr.
william
terry
bray
i
frankly
do
not
know.
it
is
my
understanding,
of
course
the
board
could
subpoena
the
witness
to
have
him
come
and
it
has
broad
powers
to
do
this.
mr.
william
terry
bray
precisely
and
indeed
the
rule
specifically
provides
for
deposition
although
that
is
not
the
usual
procedure
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
it's
my
submission
that
not
only
is
it
incidental
to
it,
but
indeed
testifying
is
that
word
is
used
in
section
8
(a)
(4)
is
broad
enough
in
context
to
include
all
of
the
proceedings
for
board
agents
from
the
time
the
charge
is
filed
until
such
time
as
the
hearing
actually
gets
underway.
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes
sir.
let
me
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
that
is
our
submission.
that
was
predecessor
provision.
that
was
the
language
of
the
predecessor
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
precisely,
and
at
the
time
section
8
(a)
(4)
was
enacted
and
it
is
supplanted
this
executive
order,
not
only
did
congress
not
indicate
any
intent
to
narrow
protections
offered,
but
the
senate
memorandum
quoted
in
our
brief
indicated
that
section
8
(a)
(4)
was
intended
as
a
mere
reiteration
of
the
executive
order
and
thus
it
is
our
submission
that
8
(a)
(4)
like
its
predecessor
covers
any
giving
of
evidence
and
certainly
the
giving
of
sworn
statements
such
as
here.
further,
this
comports
with
the
clear
legislative
purpose
behind
the
section
as
this
court
explained
to
that
purpose
in
nash
versus
florida
industrial
commission.
there
the
court
stated
that
congress
by
enacting
section
8
(a)
(4)
has
made
clear
that
it
wishes
all
persons
with
information
about
unfair
labor
practices
to
be
completely
free
from
any
employer
coercion
against
reporting
them
to
the
board.
the
reason
that
this
type
of
protection
is
necessary
is
well
stated
in
the
john
hancock
case,
also
cited
in
our
brief
and
from
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
these
protections
must
be
available
in
order
to
prevent
the
boards
challenge
of
information
from
being
brought
up
by
employer
intimidation.
the
basic
aim
was
to
keep
free
and
unimpeded
the
channels
of
communications
between
both
the
board
on
the
one
hand
and
the
participants
in
its
proceedings
on
the
other
and
to
dispel
any
fear
by
the
participants
that
by
assisting
the
board
in
its
investigation,
they
might
be
subjected
to
employer
reprisals.
preliminary
preparations,
including
the
taking
of
sworn
statements
such
as
here,
are
every
bit
as
essential
to
an
effective
board
proceeding
as
are
the
filing
of
charges
and
the
actual
giving
of
testimony
in
a
formal
board
hearing
and
thus
should
be
included
within
the
scope
of
this
section.
as
i
have
indicated,
this
interpretation
for
which
we
urge
is
highly
consistent
with
the
legislative
history
of
this
provision.
it
--
certainly
under
the
executive
order,
under
the
national
industrial
recovery
act
this
type
of
statement
would
have
been
protected
in
congress
when
it
was
replaced
the
executive
order
with
section
8
(a)
(4),
indicated
that
it
did
not
intend
to
change
the
coverage
of
protection
afforded.
mr.
william
terry
bray
certainly,
with
respect
to
the
eighth
circuit,
yes
sir.
mr.
william
terry
bray
it
was
not
my
knowledge.
there
is
no
certain
history
on
it
in
the
citing.
mr.
william
terry
bray
other
than
the
fact
that
in
that
case,
i
certainly
know
one
reason
why
and
the
reason
i
think
it's
certainly
a
fact.
in
that
case,
the
board
had
found
that
the
discharge
involved
violated
other
sections
of
the
acts,
specifically
sections
8
(a)
(1)
and
8
(a)
(3).
the
court
of
appeals
had
no
difficulty
in
sustaining
the
order
with
respect
to
those
two
sections
and
it
held
that
it
was
reluctant
to
enforce
section
8
(a)
(4)
in
the
circumstances
of
the
case.
obviously,
we
had
the
same
relief
that
we
would
have
had
even
if
section
8
(a)
(4)
had
been
enforced
because
that
was
not
the
type
of
case
that
we
needed
to
bring
to
this
court.
here
on
the
other
hand,
the
court
has
refused
to
give
these
employees
any
relief
from
what
we
consider
to
be
obvious
unfair
labor
practices
and
we
think
too
that
the
board
correctly
asserted
jurisdiction
in
this
context.
mr.
william
terry
bray
that
is
correct,
yes
sir.
mr.
william
terry
bray
it
may
well
had
been
denied
for
administrative
reasons.
mr.
william
terry
bray
that
is
right.
this
view
also
is
consistent
with
longstanding
board
interpretation
of
section
8
(a)
(4).
the
board
has
not
always
invoked
section
8
(a)
(4)
when
other
violations
are
involved
and
the
remedies
for
those
other
violations
would
be
the
same
as
the
remedies
under
section
8
(a)
(4).
indeed,
we
think
that
explains
the
overprotective
service
company
case
on
which
respondents
rely
and
in
which
the
board
merely
adopted
its
examiners
finding
that
it
would
not
invoke
an
8
(a)
(4)
violation
pro
forma
and
without
considering
the
matter.
where
the
board
has
given
detailed
consideration
to
the
issue,
it
has
uniformly
held
at
section
8
(a)
(4)
is
violated
when
an
employer
makes
discharges
because
of
participating
in
board
proceedings.
the
practicalities
of
agency
action
also
demand
this
result.
a
participant
in
a
board
proceeding
often
does
not
actually
file
charges
or
testify.
he
may
not
testify
because
his
testimony
is
cumulative
as
happened
in
the
dal-tex
case
or
because
the
cases
settled
or
dismissed
before
it
gets
to
hearing
which
happens
in
over
90%
of
the
boards
cases
according
to
its
35th
annual
report
or
the
situation
may
be
as
it
was
here,
the
employer
discharges
his
employees
immediately
upon
learning
of
their
assistance
to
the
board
and
before
any
hearing
could
possibly
have
started.
if
no
protection
is
afforded
for
participants
in
these
situations
and
we
think
it
is
obvious
that
the
participants
will
be
much
less
willing
to
assist
in
board
proceedings
and
that
this
will
impair
the
board
in
its
investigative
and
other
statutory
efforts.
finally,
several
courts
of
appeals
had
agreed
with
our
view
of
section
8
(a)
(4),
specifically
the
fifth
circuit
has
twice
sustained
board
orders
finding
section
8
(a)
(4)
violation
in
essentially
similar
context
as
that
presented
here.
the
m
&
s
steel
company
case
on
page
16
of
our
brief
as
well
as
the
dal-tex
optical
company
case
on
that
same
page
involved
section
8
(a)
(4)
violations
where
the
employee
was
discriminated
against
either
for
giving
statements
through
a
board
agent
or
for
appearing
at
a
board
hearing,
but
not
actually
testifying.
the
cases
cited
at
note
11
of
our
brief
on
page
16
indicate
that
other
courts
of
appeals
had
also
broadly
read
section
8
(a)
(4)
to
protect
participants
in
board
proceedings
in
context
other
than
merely
filing
charges
or
testifying.
finally,
the
subpoena
powers
under
section
11
support
our
view.
as
i
indicated,
the
board
could
have
subpoenaed
these
men
to
give
the
statements
which
they
gave
the
agent,
had
they
not
done
so
willingly.
in
that
event,
the
second
circuit
has
held
that
the
board
must
assert
jurisdiction
to
protect
the
participants
in
board
proceedings.
it
cannot
decline
to
assert
jurisdiction
in
that
circumstance.
while
the
employees
here
gave
their
statements
willingly,
we
think
this
should
be
encouraged,
not
discouraged,
and
that
there
is
no
sound
reason
for
denying
equal
protections
to
the
voluntary
participant
as
to
those
who
appear
under
subpoena.
turning
to
section
8
(a)
(1),
it
was
the
boards
position
and
it
is
our
position
here
that
the
discharges
on
the
grounds
which
the
examiner
found,
independently
violated
section
8
(a)
(1).
we
do
not
think
that
the
court
below
gave
any
significant
consideration
to
this
issue
and
instead
rushed
it
off
with
the
explanation
that
to
uphold
an
independent
8
(a)
(1)
violation
would
be
implicitly
to
overrule
ritchie,
even
though
ritchie
involved
only
section
8
(a)
(4).
it
is
our
position
that
these
discharges
are
clearly
barred
by
section
8
(a)
(1).
that
section
prohibits
employer
conduct
that
interferes
with,
restrains
or
coerces
employees
in
the
exercise
of
rights
guaranteed
by
section
7.
section
7
in
turn
assures
broadly
that
employee
shall
have
the
right
to
inform,
join
or
assist
labor
organizations
and
to
engage
in
other
concerted
activities
for
purpose
of
collective
bargaining
or
other
mutual
aid
or
protection.
the
board
and
various
courts
of
appeals
have
repeatedly
held
that
section
7
-
that
the
section
7
guarantees
include
the
right
to
participate
and
given
information
in
board
proceedings
as
well
as
the
right
to
have
others
do
the
same
without
fear
of
being
penalized
by
an
employer
for
having
done
so.
as
i
mentioned,
the
oil
city
brass
works
case
as
well
as
the
other
cases
on
page
18
of
our
brief
established
this
proposition.
further,
it
is
well
established
that
employer
discrimination
because
of
participating
in
the
board
proceedings
or
because
of
doing
so
on
behalf
of
others,
unlawfully
restrains
rank
and
file
employees
in
the
free
exercise
of
their
section
7
rights
and
thus
violates
section
8
(a)
(1).
indeed
the
fifth
circuit
has
gone
so
far
as
to
hold
that
this
is
an
8
(a)
(1)
violation
as
a
matter
of
law.
several
courts
of
appeals'
cases
involved
quite
similar
circumstances
to
those
here.
the
electro
motive
company
case
at
pages
18
and
19
of
our
brief
from
the
fourth
circuit
held
that
an
employer
discharge
of
a
board
participant
for
having
given
a
board
agent
a
statement,
precisely
the
circumstances
here,
violated
section
8
(a)
(1).
the
southland
paint
case
from
the
fifth
circuit
similarly
held
that
the
discharge
of
a
participant
because
he
testified
in
a
board
hearing
and
because
he
gave
an
affidavit
to
a
board
agent
violated
section
8
(a)
(1).
in
this
latter
case,
the
fifth
circuit
said
that
an
affidavit
given
in
a
board
proceeding
is
essentially
the
equivalent
of
testifying
in
a
board
hearing.
while
both
these
cases
involved
the
discharge
of
a
supervisor,
yet
we
think
the
present
case
is
even
a
stronger
one
for
invoking
the
protections
of
section
8
(a)
(1).
supervisors
generally
are
excluded
from
the
protections
of
the
act
and
yet
in
those
cases,
the
courts
found
that
they
must
be
protected
in
order
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
rank
and
file
employees
to
an
effective
board
proceeding.
it
seems
to
us
to
follow
that
certainly
where
an
employee
himself
who
is
protected
by
the
act
participates
in
a
board
proceeding
and
then
he
is
discharged
for
having
done
so,
the
circumstances
here,
that
section
8
(a)
(1)
has
been
violated
because
his
section
7
rights
had
been
infringed.
the
texas
industries
case
set
forth
at
page
19
of
our
brief
also
supports
our
view
of
section
8
(a)
(1).
there
the
fifth
circuit
upheld
the
board
finding
that
merely
asking
employees
about
statements
they
had
given
a
board
agent
and
for
copies
of
those
statements
violated
section
8
(a)
(1).
we
think
again
that
the
present
case
where
the
employer
goes
much
further
and
discharges
the
employees
because
they
had
done
so
is
even
more
appropriate
for
invoking
the
section
8
(a)
(1)
protections.
the
reasons
that
we
have
stated
with
respect
to
section
8
(a)
(4),
also
many
of
those
apply
to
support
our
construction
of
section
8
(a)
(1).
the
legislative
purpose
of
protecting
all
board
participants
and
assuring
that
all
persons
with
information
about
unfair
labor
practices
are
free
to
come
before
the
board,
certainly
justifies
this
construction.
moreover,
the
practicalities
of
agency
practice
and
the
fact
that
many
participants
do
not
actually
testify
or
file
charges
supports
our
construction
of
8
(a)
(1)
in
order
to
assure
these
men
that
they
will
be
protected
from
discharge
for
having
come
before
the
board.
lastly,
this
has
been
the
consistent
board
construction
of
section
8
(a)
(1)
over
many
years
and
this
is
entitled
to
weight.
the
section
11
subpoena
powers
also
support
this
view.
as
i
have
explained
the
employees
could
have
been
subpoenaed
to
give
the
statements
and
had
they
done
so,
it
is
also
clear
that
the
section
8
(a)
(1)
protections
are
as
broad
as
the
section
11
subpoena
powers.
mr.
william
terry
bray
with
respect
to
whether
the
type
of
activity
here
involved
is
included
within
section
7,
yes,
but
we
think
that
that
is
clear.
there
had
been
numerable
holdings
to
that
effect
and
we
do
not
understand
the
eighth
circuit
to
have
denied
enforcement
of
our
order
here
on
the
grounds
that
this
type
of
activity
is
not
protected
activity
under
section
7.
mr.
william
terry
bray
the
right
of
employees
--
the
general
right
of
employees
to
engage
in
concerted
activity
is
or
includes
the
right
to
invoke
and
have
an
effective
board
proceeding
to
protect
those
rights.
this
has
been
held
in
all
of
the
cases
cited
in
our
brief
and
we
think
it
is
well
established
that
right
is
infringed
when
a
participant
in
a
board
proceeding
is
discharged
because
of
having
done
so.
as
i
say
judge
reese
of
the
fifth
circuit
concluded
that
a
discharge
on
this
ground
violated
section
8
(a)
(1)
rights
as
a
matter
of
law.
had
these
employees
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
well,
it
is
redundant
if
you
accept
my
construction
of
section
8
(a)
(4),
but
there
is
no
problem
there
because
it
is
clearly
established
that
the
same
activity
can
violate
one
or
all
of
the
sections
of
the
act,
it
need
not
violate
just
one.
had
these
employees
been
subpoenaed
as
i
say,
it
is
clear
that
they
would
have
been
protected.
further,
the
mere
fact
that
these
employees
appeared
voluntarily
rather
than
pursuant
to
a
subpoena
is
not
any
ground
for
denying
them
similar
protections
and
indeed
the
fourth
circuit
in
the
electro
motive
company
case
showed
that
this
had
to
be
so
because
the
effect
on
the
protected
rights
is
precisely
the
same
whether
or
not
the
participant
has
been
subpoenaed
and
the
court
in
that
case
held
that
it
did
not
make
any
difference
whether
or
not
(voice
overlap).
mr.
william
terry
bray
if
we
had
one
employee
involved
and
he
was
engaged
in
union
activities,
yes,
we
would
argue
that
this
was
a
protective
right
under
section
7.
in
other
words,
i
think
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
i
think
that
--
reading,
if
i
may
the
language
of
section
8
(a)
(1),
it
could
be
within
a
number
of
the
protections
of
section
8
(a)
(1).
it
need
not
be
just
in
the
concerted
activity.
mr.
william
terry
bray
i
beg
your
pardon.
section
7.
it
could
be
within
a
number
to
the
provision
of
section
7.
(voice

let
me
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
i
am
sorry
i
do
not
have
the
language
of
the
section,
your
honor.
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes
sir.
mr.
william
terry
bray
thank
you.
