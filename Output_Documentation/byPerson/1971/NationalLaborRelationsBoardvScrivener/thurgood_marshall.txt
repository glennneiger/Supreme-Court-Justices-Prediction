justice
thurgood
marshall
yes

justice
thurgood
marshall
no

justice
thurgood
marshall
no
evidence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
difference
in
your
contract
and
operating
your

justice
thurgood
marshall
was
the
purpose
to
ensure
that
the

would
have
a
right

give
his
information
to
the

is
that
the
main
purpose
and
that
he
should
not
be

for
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
before
you
get
to
that,
and
how
under
the
sun
does
the
board
get
its
charges
if
it
does
not
talk
to
the
employees?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
how

find
out
that
the

have
a
grievance?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that

not
what
i
am
talking

guess
i
am
back
with
chief

original
point.

are
talking
to
your
witness
before
and
he
is
not
protected.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
how
about
if
the
employer
says,
you
were
talking
to
the
labor
board
man
last
night
and
then
this
lady
and
says
to
him
and
oh,
by
the
way,
i
am
sure
the
business
is
going
to
lay
you
off,
that
is
not
protected?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
ample
protection
for
the
employee?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
much
difference
--
is
there
a
lot
different
in
the
standard
of
proof
under
criminal
prosecution
in
a
hearing
before
and
then
allowed
to
(inaudible)?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
why
is
this
rule
about
the

for?
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
if
you
do
not
need
the
testimony
provision,
if

got
the
criminal
provision?

thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
wholly
wasn't
the
