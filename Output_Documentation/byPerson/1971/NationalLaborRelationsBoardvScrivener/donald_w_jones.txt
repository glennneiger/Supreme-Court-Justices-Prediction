mr.
donald
w.
jones
i
think
that
would
be
true,
your
honor.
however,
this
case
i
want
to
emphasize
at
the
outset,
this
case
has
a
very
unusual
features
which
made
it
unlikely
that
any
statements
would
be
taken
in
this
case
from
any
employees.
mr.
donald
w.
jones
well,
the
board
has
foreseen
this
difficulty
i
think
and
they
have
and
the
congress
has
as
well.
in
connection
with
the
administrative
procedure
act
which
has
some
provisions
that
make
all
certain
government
records
available
to
the
public
information.
they
have
exempted
the
statements
by
the
board,
the
congress
has
in
administrative
procedure
act
and
congress
has
said
these
statements
may
be
held
strictly
confidential.
they
are
exempted
from
the
public
information
provisions
of
the
board.
so
all
statements
taken
by
the
board
in
investigations
are
held
to
be
strictly
confidential
by
law
and
they
cannot
be,
the
contents
of
those
statements
are
the
fact
that
they
are
taking
cannot
be
--
mr.
donald
w.
jones
that
is
true
your
honor.
however,
the
statements
that
we
are
talking
about
are
taken
at
a
stage
of
the
proceedings
which
is
before
any
complaint
has
been
issued
and
as
to
--
mr.
donald
w.
jones
right.
however,
in
our
case,
your
honor,
if
i
may
go
back
to
facts
of
this
case
momentarily,
in
this
case,
the
facts
are
this.
the
charge
was
filed
containing
a
claim
of
8
(a)
(1),
8
(a)
(3)
and
8
(a)
(5),
i
believe
originally.
immediately
upon
getting
this
charge,
the
company
counsel,
there
was
myself,
wrote
a
letter
to
the
regional
director
and
informed
the
regional
director
of
the
board
that
this
company
did
not
meet
the
board?s
jurisdictional
standards.
they
did
not
meet
the
$50,000.00
requirement
for
board
jurisdiction
and
we
offered
at
that
time
to
show
our
books
and
records
to
the
nlrb
so
that
they
can
see
that
they
had
no
jurisdiction
over
this
company.
at
the
same
time,
the
company
sent
the
three
employees
then
involved
who
had
allegedly
according
to
those
original
charges
been
laid
off
sent
them
a
letter
saying,
you
have
not
been
laid
off,
you
are
free
to
work
here
as
usual
as
long
as
work
is
available,
this
is
a
misunderstanding.
we
sent
a
copy
of
that
the
board.
the
employees
came
back
to
work.
now,
about
a
month
later,
the
labor
board
agent
came
down
to
my
office,
as
this
is
shown
in
the
record
and
we
had
a
meeting
to
go
over
the
books
and
records
of
the
company
to
see
if
in
fact
the
board
had
jurisdiction.
now,
contrary
to
what
is
said
by
petitioners
brief,
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
we
discussed
the
merits
of
the
charges
at
that
time
and
in
fact,
we
did
not.
we
discuss
merely
the
fact
of
whether
there
was
jurisdiction.
now,
we
had
no
idea
that
board
was
going
to
take
any
statements
from
any
of
our
employees
at
that
time.
there
is
no
requirement
that
the
board
do
so.
we
think
the
board
had
no
reason
to
take
any
statements
from
employees,
if
they
have
no
jurisdiction
over
the
company
at
that
stage.
now,
at
that
stage,
then,
there
anything
prior
to
that
time
is
no
longer
claimed
to
be
a
violation
before
this
court
because
the
labor
board
itself
after
the
hearing
declined
to
assert
jurisdiction
on
anything
up
to
that
date.
now,
later,
the
next
day
according
to
the
evidence,
the
next
day
after
the
company
representative
and
i
met
with
the
labor
board
investigator
in
my
office,
went
over
our
financial
records
which
show
as
according
to,
as
everyone
now
admits
that
the
board
did
not
have
jurisdiction
at
that
point.
it
was
at
the
outset,
this
company
was
too
small
to
meet
the
boards
jurisdictional
standards.
this
company
as
a
result
of
being
too
small
to
meet
the
boards
jurisdictional
standards,
this
company
could
not
get
access
to
the
board
process
as
to
protect
it
from
an
illegal
secondary
boycott
which
the
union
started
out
against
the
company
on
march
15,
1968
at
a
time
when
the
union
representative
involved
in
this
case
admits
he
did
not
represent
a
single
employee
of
this
employer.
so
when
that
march
15,
1968
picketing
started
at
an
apartment
house
project
where
my
client
had
some
men
working,
my
client
did
not
go
to
the
labor
board
and
say,
please
help
us
stop
this
secondary
boycott
because
it
violates
8
(b)
(4).
because
the
labor
boards
jurisdictional
standard
published
said,
no,
no
i
am
sorry
mr.
scrivener,
you
are
too
small
for
us
to
protect.
we
have
got
no
time
to
protect
you.
so
later
when
the
union
came
and
said
now
as
the
evidence
shows
on
the
8
(a)
(5)
allegation,
when
the
union
came
and
presented
the
cards
to
the
company
and
said
now
we
signed
up
the
majority
of
your
people,
we
want
to
bargain
with
you.
even
though
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
has
said
in
gissel
packing
company
just
a
few
years
ago,
that
an
employer
has
an
absolute
right
to
an
election
under
9
(c)
(1)
(b)
under
the
act
before
they
have
to
bargain.
this
company,
my
client
could
not
get
an
election
on
the
labor
board
because
the
board
has
published
standard
saying,
no,
robert
scrivener,
you
are
too
small,
we
have
got
no
time
to
give
you
an
election.
we
have
got
not
time
to
let
you
have
access
to
our
processes.
so
then
the
union
came
along
and
this
union
in
this
town,
this
particular
union
in
this
town
has
a
standard
form
agreement
that
the
only
kind
of
agreement
they
will
sign
is
a
standard
form
agreement
which
has
been
negotiated
at
the
national
level
by
the
national
electrical
contact
association
and
international
electrical
union.
so
when
they
presented
this
contract
to
my
client
and
said,
now,
you
sign
this
by
6
o?clock
tonight
or
else
as
shown
by
the
record
in
that
contract
as
an
exhibit
in
the
appendix.
even
though
that
type
was
demand
especially
when
the
contract
contains
unlawful
non-mandatory
subject
to
bargaining
and
would
--
and
exceeding
to
that
demand
would
require
my
client
to
delegate
his
bargaining
responsibilities
to
another
association
in
violation
of
his
rights
under
law
and
even
though
this
has
been
declared
unlawful
by
the
board,
my
client
could
not
file
a
charge
with
the
board
because
he
is
too
small
to
protect.
so,
now
the
board
has
--
the
general
counsels
office
of
the
board
has
attempted
to
use
8
(a)
(4)
to
prosecute
my
client
as
a
device
when
they
have
no
jurisdiction
to
protect
them
or
to
prosecute
him
under
the
own
published
standards.
now,
i
want
to
go
to
the
events
that
brought
about
this
layoff
and
i
would
like
to
clarify
this.
we
hear
talk
about
discharges.
there
is
no
evidence
of
any
discharges
on
april
18,
1958.
there
was
an
economic
layoff
on
that
date.
on
april
18,
1958
which
was
a
day
or
two
after,
i
think
the
record
shows
it
was
the
next
day
after
the
labor
board
had
taken
statements
from
the
men
the
night
before
at
the
union
hall,
those
statements
were
taken
without
notice
to
us.
we
were
not
present.
we
had
no
right
to
be
present.
they
were
confidential.
we
have
no
notice
of
it,
no
knowledge
of
it.
the
next
morning,
the
evidence
shows
that
two
of
the
employees
and
mr.
scrivener
had
some
conversation.
it
was
an
isolated,
neighborly
conversation
that
people
in
the
ozarks
customarily
have
in
a
small
company
like
this.
it
is
not
clear,
completely
clear
who
started
the
conversation,
whether
the
employees
started
or
whether
mr.
scrivener
started
it.
our
version
is
that
the
employee
came
up
to
mr.
scrivener
and
said,
hey
bob,
we
talked
to
the
labor
board
man
last
night.
mr.
donald
w.
jones
the
card-examiner
used
words
similar
to
what
the
petitioner
uses
here
that
say
that
mr.
scrivener
questioned
the
employees.
we
submit
that
the
record
is
completely
opposite
to
that
thing.
now,
we
have
preserved
our
argument
that
there
is
no
substantial
evidence
to
support
the
findings
of
a
trial
examiner
at
every
stage
of
the
proceedings.
we
urged
that
to
the
board
in
our
exceptions
which
are
in
detail
in
the
appendix.
we
urged
that
to
the
eight
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
our
brief,
parts
of
which
we
made
an
appendix
through
our
brief
and
our
position
to
a
certiorari
in
this
court
so
that
there
are
here
in
this
court
--
mr.
donald
w.
jones
that
there
were
fired?
mr.
donald
w.
jones
no,
your
honor,
there
was
not.
mr.
donald
w.
jones
no,
here
is
the
situation
on
that.
mr.
donald
w.
jones
there
was
no
evidence.
there
were
facts.
the
evidence
was
that
they
were
laid
off
on
a
thursday
afternoon,
april
18,
it
happen
to
occur
on
the
thursday
afternoon.
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
that
they
were
fired.
they
were
laid
off
at
that
time.
mr.
donald
w.
jones
well,
the
lay
off
have
a
reasonable
expectancy
of
recall
and
mr.
scrivener
told
him
as
shown
by
the
record,
as
found
by
the
trial
examiner,
that
it
was
a
thursday
afternoon
when
the
men
came
back
that
afternoon
after
having
had
this
brief
conversation
with
two
of
them
about,
hey
bob,
we
have
talked
to
the
labor
board
man
last
night.
mr.
scrivener
said,
that
old
boy
sure
will
not
tell
you
much
really.
this
was
the
appellees
testimony.
mr.
scrivener
did
not
remember
this
and
he
testified
that
he
had
no
knowledge
of
the
fact
that
they
had
even
given
statements
at
the
time
he
laid
them
off
on
april
18.
mr.
donald
w.
jones
yes,
your
honor
i
do
and
now
here
is
--
mr.
donald
w.
jones
yes,
the
legal
question.
if
we
would
assume
--
what
you
really
are
asking
i
think
is
does
the
law
as
now
written,
does
the
law
as
now
written,
require
an
interpretation
of
8
(a)
(1)
or
8
(a)
(4)
that
an
employer
that
went
out
and
said,
you
son
of
a
gun
you
gave
a
statement
to
the
labor
board,
you
are
fired.
now,
would
that
be
a
violation
of
8
(a)
(1)
or
8
(a)
(4)
for
giving
a
written
statement?
i
would
say
it
would
not
be
a
violation
of
8
(a)
(1)
or
8
(a)
(4).
definitely,
it
would
not
be
a
violation
of
8
(a)
(4)
which
on
the
point
of
giving
testimony
under
the
act
because
of
the
meaning
of
the
word
testimony
and
i
think
that
meaning
is
clear.
now,
however,
if
the
purpose
of
the
employer
was
to
discourage
unionism
in
doing
that,
it
would
be
a
violation
of
8
(a)
(3),
it
would
be
a
violation
of
8
(a)
(3).
mr.
donald
w.
jones
the
trial
examiner
so
found.
the
trial
examiner
found
that
that
violated
8
(a)
(3).
now,
we
appealed
that
decision
to
the
labor
board
with
our
exceptions.
we
presented
these
arguments
concerning
the
fact
that
the
labor
board
had
no
jurisdiction
under
its
own
jurisdictional
standards
and
the
labor
board
did
not
review
the
findings,
in
fact
on
8
(a)
(3)
that
they
did
decline
to
assert
jurisdiction
on
8
(a)
(3)
on
the
grounds
that
it
would
not
be
fair
for
them
to
prosecute
my
client
under
8
(a)
(3)
when
he
was
outside
their
jurisdiction,
under
published
standards
which
were
authorized
by
congress
under
section
14
(c)
(1)
of
the
act.
congress
said
-
congress
when
enacted
the
labor
act,
they
gave
the
labor
board
the
power
consistent
with
the
commerce
clause,
all
the
power
they
had
to,
on
affecting
commerce
but
they
also
at
a
later
time
enacted
section
14
(c)
(1)
which
gave
the
board
authority
to
decline,
to
assert
jurisdiction
over
a
certain
class
or
category
of
employee
--
employers.
the
labor
board
has
exercised
that
power
and
has
promulgated
jurisdictional
standards
declining
to
exercise
jurisdiction
over
a
class
or
category
of
employer
which
in
the
non-retail
trade
and
non-retail
industry
is
$50,000.00
annually.
my
client
is
a
small
employer.
he
does
not
meet
that
and
therefore
the
labor
board
through
that,
the
8
(a)
(3),
the
8
(a)
(1),
and
the
8
(a)
(5),
the
labor
board
at
page
275
of
the
appendix
--
mr.
donald
w.
jones
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
very
important
for
this
court
to
consider
this
case
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
now
--
mr.
donald
w.
jones
yes.
let
me
go
to
the
boards
decision
in
this
case.
mr.
donald
w.
jones
no,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
w.
jones
no,
your
honor,
here
is
my
position
on
that
and
i
think
that
i
am
correct
on
this.
in
the
eighth
circuit,
we
had
roughly
six
arguments
which
had
been
preserved
at
all
stages.
those
arguments
were
lack
of
statutory
jurisdiction,
we
claim
that
the
board
did
not
even
prove
statutory
jurisdiction.
mr.
donald
w.
jones
well
--
mr.
donald
w.
jones
i
see
what
your
honor
is
referring
to.
the
point
is
in
my
opinion,
if
the
court,
i
want
to
make
this
clear
that
if
the
court
were
to
decide
against
me,
i
do
not
think
this
would
mean
an
outright
reversal
because
the
other
five
points
we
urged
in
the
eighth
circuit
had
never
been
considered.
the
eighth
circuit
decided
for
us
on
one
of
the
six
points.
mr.
donald
w.
jones
yes,
and
--
mr.
donald
w.
jones
they
did
say
that.
they
did
not
review
the
substantial
evidence
question.
mr.
donald
w.
jones
they
did
not
review
the
constitutional
question
as
to
whether
or
not
it
is
due
process
of
law
or
a
violation
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
to
prosecute
an
employer
who
is
too
small
to
protect
under
their
jurisdiction
standard,
to
use
their
jurisdictional
standards
in
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
and
discriminatory
manner
to
prosecute
the
employer
who
is
too
small
to
protect.
they
did
not
decide
that.
and
in
fact,
while
i
am
mentioning
that
point,
the
peterson
case
that
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals'
is
squarely
on
the
point
in
my
position
on
that
point
because
that
is
--
mr.
donald
w.
jones
i
think
that
that
is
proper.
that
if
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
eighth
circuit
was
correct
on
any
grounds,
i
would
like
to
have
this
court
sustain
it
on
that
grounds
alone,
but
i
do
want
to
hasten
to
the
--
mr.
donald
w.
jones
they
passed
on
only
one
ground.
mr.
donald
w.
jones
well,
i
will
go
on
to
*
(a)
(4).
now,
there
is
no
issue
here
in
my
judgment
on
8
(a)
(1).
i
want
to
make
that
clear.
there
is
no
issue
here
on
8
(a)
(1).
i
refer
to
the
boards
decision
at
page
275
on
the
appendix.
in
these
circumstances
we
find
that
equal
and
effective
administration
of
the
process
of
the
act
require
us
to
limit
our
exercise
of
jurisdiction
to
limiting
the
section
8
(a)
(4)
violations.
the
board
did
no
assert
jurisdiction
on
8
(a)
(1).
the
board
asserted
jurisdiction
only
on
8
(a)
(4)
and
i
also
disagree
that
8
(a)
(1)
was
ever
involved
in
this
case
on
any
basis
related
to
the
8
(a)
(4)
issue
other
than
as
a
derivative
issue.
8
(a)
(4)
--
8
(a)
(1)
was
always
considered
derivative.
the
boards
decision
makes
that
clear.
this
is
standard
practice.
i
point
this
out
in
my
brief
in
our
position
to
certiorari.
mr.
donald
w.
jones
i
think
that
would
be
proper.
mr.
donald
w.
jones
alright,
thank
you
your
honor.
now,
on
the
8
(a)
(4),
we
contend
that
when
8
(a)
(4)
says
--
well,
first
of
all,
let
me
know
at
this
point.
when
we
are
considering
8
(a)
(4),
we
are
only
considering
the
portion
of
8
(a)
(4)
referring
to
testimony
under
the
act.
there
is
no
claim
here
that
any
of
the
employees
involved
gave
any
charges
under
the
act.
they
gave
the
-
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
statements
they
gave
were
testimony
and
so
we
are
not
concerned
with
any
--
whether
or
not
8
(a)
(4)
is
violating
in
regard
to
charges.
this
is
only
statements,
whether
it
is
testimony
--
whether
it
is
statements
or
testimony?
we
contend
that
the
word
testimony
as
used
by
congress
is
one
that
has
been
long
understood
by
lawyers,
legislators
and
courts.
we
cite
several
cases
of
general
application
on
the
use
of
that
word.
congress
obviously
knew
what
the
word
testimony
meant
when
they
used
it
in
the
statute.
congress
used
that
word,
they
did
not
use
the
words
statements.
they
did
not
use
the
word
of
broader
application.
they
use
a
technical,
legal
term
testimony
and
we
contend
that
the
statute
on
its
face
is
clear
and
unambiguous
and
that
it
should
be
so
read
and
that
the
eighth
circuits
interpretation
of
it
is
just
exactly
what
congress
wrote.
mr.
donald
w.
jones
the
--
i
think
the
purpose
was
exactly
what
congress
--
i
have
to
rely
on
finding
the
purpose
of
congress
upon
exactly
what
they
said.
i
think
the
purpose,
at
least
it
appears
to
me,
that
when
congress
wrote
8
(a)
(4),
they
said
the
employees
need
protection
in
two
cases,
in
two
situations.
one,
where
they
file
a
charge
and
directly
confront
their
employer,
we
do
not
want
them
to
be
fired
or
discriminated
against
because
they
filed
charges,
that
issue
is
not
here;
two,
where
they
gave
testimony
in
a
board
hearing.
now
before
and
if
you
look
at
whole
act
together,
under
a
board
hearing
when
the
charge
is
filed
and
it's
investigated
and
a
complaint
is
issued
and
notice
of
hearing.
at
the
hearing,
the
employer
has
a
right
to
appear
cross-examine
the
witnesses,
including
any
employees
who
gave
testimony,
the
employer
has
a
right
to
cross-examine.
mr.
donald
w.
jones
that
is
true.
it
is
not
set
forth
in
the
statute
how
the
board
goes
about
their
investigation
and
how
the
rules
do
--
mr.
donald
w.
jones
well,
it
is
clear
under
the
law
as
this
court
held
in
nash
versus
industrial
commission
in
florida
and
another
case,
it
is
clear
under
the
law
and
under
the
statute
that
the
board
itself
cannot
initiate
a
charge
which
incidentally,
that
is
another
point.
mr.
donald
w.
jones
a
charge
has
to
be
filed
by
some
person
and
then
the
board
investigates
as
they
deem
--
mr.
donald
w.
jones
oh!
i
do
think
he
is
protected.
i
never
did
give
in
making
that
point.
i
think
there
is
ample
protection.
congress
has
provided
a
criminal
penalty
which
is
ample
protection.
now,
if
you
say
an
employer
says
to
an
employee,
i
am
going
to
fire
you
because
you
gave
a
statement
to
the
labor
board.
well,
if
his
purpose
is
violated
8
(a)
(3),
then
that
is
protection.
however,
if
you
say
--
mr.
donald
w.
jones
in
section
12
of
the
act,
congress
provides
a
criminal
penalty
for
anyone
interfering
with
board
processes
or
the
performance
of
the
duties
of
the
labor
board
investigator
or
agent
of
any
board
member.
there
are
criminal
penalties
there.
these
provides
ample
protection
so
to
merely
construe
8
(a)
(4)
--
mr.
donald
w.
jones
i
think
it
would
be.
i
certainly
think
it
would
be
ill
advice
for
an
employer
to
do
anything
to
an
employee
that
would
be
interfering
with
the
board
agent?s
powers
if
it
were
subject
to
$5,000.00
penalty.
mr.
donald
w.
jones
yes,
there
is
obviously
and
--
mr.
donald
w.
jones
well,
it
think
it
is
--
mr.
donald
w.
jones
congress
says,
provided
--
i
think
congress
saw
that
an
employee
who
appeared
in
open
court
against
his
employer
when
his
employer
was
sitting
there
and
listening
to
every
word,
cross-examining,
the
employer
was
present,
i
think
that
is
what
congress
meant
to
protect.
mr.
donald
w.
jones
well,
if
the
employee
had
given
testimony,
he
is
protected
for
against
any
discrimination
for
that
testimony
once
the
employer
heard.
i
do
not
think
congress
meant
to
say
that
an
employer
could
be
held
guilty
of
discriminating
against
an
employee
for
something
an
employee
said
in
a
secret
statement
about
which
the
employer
has
no
knowledge.
now,
how
can
--
in
all
these
8
(a)
(4)
cases
and
i
include
the
ones
cited
by
the
petitioner
and
i
believe
in
every
one
of
them
that
i
can
recall
at
least,
there
may
be
one
or
two
exceptions
that
i
do
not
recall,
but
in
everyone
that
i
recall,
when
the
board
finds
an
8
(a)
(4)
violation,
they
find
it
on
the
basis
that
there
were
some
adverse
testimony
to
the
employer.
now,
we
do
not
--
now
on
this
record
there
is
only
one
statement
in
the
evidence
that
of
don
cockrum
(ph).
the
other
three
men
said
they
gave
statements
to
the
labor
board
investigator.
they
did
not
say
they
were
written
and
sworn.
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
other
three
gave
written
and
sworn
statements.
how
could
this
employer
know
whether
the
statements
given
were
helpful
or
harmful?
how
could
he
be
motivated
to
discriminate
against
the
employees
if
he
did
not
know
what
they
had
said
or
anything?
and
i
think
congress
--
i
think
congress
never,
never
even
considered
that
8
(a)
(4)
might
be
possibly
used
to
put
an
employer
in
a
situation
with
this
one
he
is
in.
mr.
donald
w.
jones
i
think
that
would
be
true,
your
honor.
however,
this
case
i
want
to
emphasize
at
the
outset,
this
case
has
a
very
unusual
features
which
made
it
unlikely
that
any
statements
would
be
taken
in
this
case
from
any
employees.
mr.
donald
w.
jones
well,
the
board
has
foreseen
this
difficulty
i
think
and
they
have
and
the
congress
has
as
well.
in
connection
with
the
administrative
procedure
act
which
has
some
provisions
that
make
all
certain
government
records
available
to
the
public
information.
they
have
exempted
the
statements
by
the
board,
the
congress
has
in
administrative
procedure
act
and
congress
has
said
these
statements
may
be
held
strictly
confidential.
they
are
exempted
from
the
public
information
provisions
of
the
board.
so
all
statements
taken
by
the
board
in
investigations
are
held
to
be
strictly
confidential
by
law
and
they
cannot
be,
the
contents
of
those
statements
are
the
fact
that
they
are
taking
cannot
be
--
mr.
donald
w.
jones
that
is
true
your
honor.
however,
the
statements
that
we
are
talking
about
are
taken
at
a
stage
of
the
proceedings
which
is
before
any
complaint
has
been
issued
and
as
to
--
mr.
donald
w.
jones
right.
however,
in
our
case,
your
honor,
if
i
may
go
back
to
facts
of
this
case
momentarily,
in
this
case,
the
facts
are
this.
the
charge
was
filed
containing
a
claim
of
8
(a)
(1),
8
(a)
(3)
and
8
(a)
(5),
i
believe
originally.
immediately
upon
getting
this
charge,
the
company
counsel,
there
was
myself,
wrote
a
letter
to
the
regional
director
and
informed
the
regional
director
of
the
board
that
this
company
did
not
meet
the
board?s
jurisdictional
standards.
they
did
not
meet
the
$50,000.00
requirement
for
board
jurisdiction
and
we
offered
at
that
time
to
show
our
books
and
records
to
the
nlrb
so
that
they
can
see
that
they
had
no
jurisdiction
over
this
company.
at
the
same
time,
the
company
sent
the
three
employees
then
involved
who
had
allegedly
according
to
those
original
charges
been
laid
off
sent
them
a
letter
saying,
you
have
not
been
laid
off,
you
are
free
to
work
here
as
usual
as
long
as
work
is
available,
this
is
a
misunderstanding.
we
sent
a
copy
of
that
the
board.
the
employees
came
back
to
work.
now,
about
a
month
later,
the
labor
board
agent
came
down
to
my
office,
as
this
is
shown
in
the
record
and
we
had
a
meeting
to
go
over
the
books
and
records
of
the
company
to
see
if
in
fact
the
board
had
jurisdiction.
now,
contrary
to
what
is
said
by
petitioners
brief,
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
we
discussed
the
merits
of
the
charges
at
that
time
and
in
fact,
we
did
not.
we
discuss
merely
the
fact
of
whether
there
was
jurisdiction.
now,
we
had
no
idea
that
board
was
going
to
take
any
statements
from
any
of
our
employees
at
that
time.
there
is
no
requirement
that
the
board
do
so.
we
think
the
board
had
no
reason
to
take
any
statements
from
employees,
if
they
have
no
jurisdiction
over
the
company
at
that
stage.
now,
at
that
stage,
then,
there
anything
prior
to
that
time
is
no
longer
claimed
to
be
a
violation
before
this
court
because
the
labor
board
itself
after
the
hearing
declined
to
assert
jurisdiction
on
anything
up
to
that
date.
now,
later,
the
next
day
according
to
the
evidence,
the
next
day
after
the
company
representative
and
i
met
with
the
labor
board
investigator
in
my
office,
went
over
our
financial
records
which
show
as
according
to,
as
everyone
now
admits
that
the
board
did
not
have
jurisdiction
at
that
point.
it
was
at
the
outset,
this
company
was
too
small
to
meet
the
boards
jurisdictional
standards.
this
company
as
a
result
of
being
too
small
to
meet
the
boards
jurisdictional
standards,
this
company
could
not
get
access
to
the
board
process
as
to
protect
it
from
an
illegal
secondary
boycott
which
the
union
started
out
against
the
company
on
march
15,
1968
at
a
time
when
the
union
representative
involved
in
this
case
admits
he
did
not
represent
a
single
employee
of
this
employer.
so
when
that
march
15,
1968
picketing
started
at
an
apartment
house
project
where
my
client
had
some
men
working,
my
client
did
not
go
to
the
labor
board
and
say,
please
help
us
stop
this
secondary
boycott
because
it
violates
8
(b)
(4).
because
the
labor
boards
jurisdictional
standard
published
said,
no,
no
i
am
sorry
mr.
scrivener,
you
are
too
small
for
us
to
protect.
we
have
got
no
time
to
protect
you.
so
later
when
the
union
came
and
said
now
as
the
evidence
shows
on
the
8
(a)
(5)
allegation,
when
the
union
came
and
presented
the
cards
to
the
company
and
said
now
we
signed
up
the
majority
of
your
people,
we
want
to
bargain
with
you.
even
though
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
has
said
in
gissel
packing
company
just
a
few
years
ago,
that
an
employer
has
an
absolute
right
to
an
election
under
9
(c)
(1)
(b)
under
the
act
before
they
have
to
bargain.
this
company,
my
client
could
not
get
an
election
on
the
labor
board
because
the
board
has
published
standard
saying,
no,
robert
scrivener,
you
are
too
small,
we
have
got
no
time
to
give
you
an
election.
we
have
got
not
time
to
let
you
have
access
to
our
processes.
so
then
the
union
came
along
and
this
union
in
this
town,
this
particular
union
in
this
town
has
a
standard
form
agreement
that
the
only
kind
of
agreement
they
will
sign
is
a
standard
form
agreement
which
has
been
negotiated
at
the
national
level
by
the
national
electrical
contact
association
and
international
electrical
union.
so
when
they
presented
this
contract
to
my
client
and
said,
now,
you
sign
this
by
6
o?clock
tonight
or
else
as
shown
by
the
record
in
that
contract
as
an
exhibit
in
the
appendix.
even
though
that
type
was
demand
especially
when
the
contract
contains
unlawful
non-mandatory
subject
to
bargaining
and
would
--
and
exceeding
to
that
demand
would
require
my
client
to
delegate
his
bargaining
responsibilities
to
another
association
in
violation
of
his
rights
under
law
and
even
though
this
has
been
declared
unlawful
by
the
board,
my
client
could
not
file
a
charge
with
the
board
because
he
is
too
small
to
protect.
so,
now
the
board
has
--
the
general
counsels
office
of
the
board
has
attempted
to
use
8
(a)
(4)
to
prosecute
my
client
as
a
device
when
they
have
no
jurisdiction
to
protect
them
or
to
prosecute
him
under
the
own
published
standards.
now,
i
want
to
go
to
the
events
that
brought
about
this
layoff
and
i
would
like
to
clarify
this.
we
hear
talk
about
discharges.
there
is
no
evidence
of
any
discharges
on
april
18,
1958.
there
was
an
economic
layoff
on
that
date.
on
april
18,
1958
which
was
a
day
or
two
after,
i
think
the
record
shows
it
was
the
next
day
after
the
labor
board
had
taken
statements
from
the
men
the
night
before
at
the
union
hall,
those
statements
were
taken
without
notice
to
us.
we
were
not
present.
we
had
no
right
to
be
present.
they
were
confidential.
we
have
no
notice
of
it,
no
knowledge
of
it.
the
next
morning,
the
evidence
shows
that
two
of
the
employees
and
mr.
scrivener
had
some
conversation.
it
was
an
isolated,
neighborly
conversation
that
people
in
the
ozarks
customarily
have
in
a
small
company
like
this.
it
is
not
clear,
completely
clear
who
started
the
conversation,
whether
the
employees
started
or
whether
mr.
scrivener
started
it.
our
version
is
that
the
employee
came
up
to
mr.
scrivener
and
said,
hey
bob,
we
talked
to
the
labor
board
man
last
night.
mr.
donald
w.
jones
the
card-examiner
used
words
similar
to
what
the
petitioner
uses
here
that
say
that
mr.
scrivener
questioned
the
employees.
we
submit
that
the
record
is
completely
opposite
to
that
thing.
now,
we
have
preserved
our
argument
that
there
is
no
substantial
evidence
to
support
the
findings
of
a
trial
examiner
at
every
stage
of
the
proceedings.
we
urged
that
to
the
board
in
our
exceptions
which
are
in
detail
in
the
appendix.
we
urged
that
to
the
eight
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
our
brief,
parts
of
which
we
made
an
appendix
through
our
brief
and
our
position
to
a
certiorari
in
this
court
so
that
there
are
here
in
this
court
--
mr.
donald
w.
jones
that
there
were
fired?
mr.
donald
w.
jones
no,
your
honor,
there
was
not.
mr.
donald
w.
jones
no,
here
is
the
situation
on
that.
mr.
donald
w.
jones
there
was
no
evidence.
there
were
facts.
the
evidence
was
that
they
were
laid
off
on
a
thursday
afternoon,
april
18,
it
happen
to
occur
on
the
thursday
afternoon.
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
that
they
were
fired.
they
were
laid
off
at
that
time.
mr.
donald
w.
jones
well,
the
lay
off
have
a
reasonable
expectancy
of
recall
and
mr.
scrivener
told
him
as
shown
by
the
record,
as
found
by
the
trial
examiner,
that
it
was
a
thursday
afternoon
when
the
men
came
back
that
afternoon
after
having
had
this
brief
conversation
with
two
of
them
about,
hey
bob,
we
have
talked
to
the
labor
board
man
last
night.
mr.
scrivener
said,
that
old
boy
sure
will
not
tell
you
much
really.
this
was
the
appellees
testimony.
mr.
scrivener
did
not
remember
this
and
he
testified
that
he
had
no
knowledge
of
the
fact
that
they
had
even
given
statements
at
the
time
he
laid
them
off
on
april
18.
mr.
donald
w.
jones
yes,
your
honor
i
do
and
now
here
is
--
mr.
donald
w.
jones
yes,
the
legal
question.
if
we
would
assume
--
what
you
really
are
asking
i
think
is
does
the
law
as
now
written,
does
the
law
as
now
written,
require
an
interpretation
of
8
(a)
(1)
or
8
(a)
(4)
that
an
employer
that
went
out
and
said,
you
son
of
a
gun
you
gave
a
statement
to
the
labor
board,
you
are
fired.
now,
would
that
be
a
violation
of
8
(a)
(1)
or
8
(a)
(4)
for
giving
a
written
statement?
i
would
say
it
would
not
be
a
violation
of
8
(a)
(1)
or
8
(a)
(4).
definitely,
it
would
not
be
a
violation
of
8
(a)
(4)
which
on
the
point
of
giving
testimony
under
the
act
because
of
the
meaning
of
the
word
testimony
and
i
think
that
meaning
is
clear.
now,
however,
if
the
purpose
of
the
employer
was
to
discourage
unionism
in
doing
that,
it
would
be
a
violation
of
8
(a)
(3),
it
would
be
a
violation
of
8
(a)
(3).
mr.
donald
w.
jones
the
trial
examiner
so
found.
the
trial
examiner
found
that
that
violated
8
(a)
(3).
now,
we
appealed
that
decision
to
the
labor
board
with
our
exceptions.
we
presented
these
arguments
concerning
the
fact
that
the
labor
board
had
no
jurisdiction
under
its
own
jurisdictional
standards
and
the
labor
board
did
not
review
the
findings,
in
fact
on
8
(a)
(3)
that
they
did
decline
to
assert
jurisdiction
on
8
(a)
(3)
on
the
grounds
that
it
would
not
be
fair
for
them
to
prosecute
my
client
under
8
(a)
(3)
when
he
was
outside
their
jurisdiction,
under
published
standards
which
were
authorized
by
congress
under
section
14
(c)
(1)
of
the
act.
congress
said
-
congress
when
enacted
the
labor
act,
they
gave
the
labor
board
the
power
consistent
with
the
commerce
clause,
all
the
power
they
had
to,
on
affecting
commerce
but
they
also
at
a
later
time
enacted
section
14
(c)
(1)
which
gave
the
board
authority
to
decline,
to
assert
jurisdiction
over
a
certain
class
or
category
of
employee
--
employers.
the
labor
board
has
exercised
that
power
and
has
promulgated
jurisdictional
standards
declining
to
exercise
jurisdiction
over
a
class
or
category
of
employer
which
in
the
non-retail
trade
and
non-retail
industry
is
$50,000.00
annually.
my
client
is
a
small
employer.
he
does
not
meet
that
and
therefore
the
labor
board
through
that,
the
8
(a)
(3),
the
8
(a)
(1),
and
the
8
(a)
(5),
the
labor
board
at
page
275
of
the
appendix
--
mr.
donald
w.
jones
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
very
important
for
this
court
to
consider
this
case
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
now
--
mr.
donald
w.
jones
yes.
let
me
go
to
the
boards
decision
in
this
case.
mr.
donald
w.
jones
no,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
w.
jones
no,
your
honor,
here
is
my
position
on
that
and
i
think
that
i
am
correct
on
this.
in
the
eighth
circuit,
we
had
roughly
six
arguments
which
had
been
preserved
at
all
stages.
those
arguments
were
lack
of
statutory
jurisdiction,
we
claim
that
the
board
did
not
even
prove
statutory
jurisdiction.
mr.
donald
w.
jones
well
--
mr.
donald
w.
jones
i
see
what
your
honor
is
referring
to.
the
point
is
in
my
opinion,
if
the
court,
i
want
to
make
this
clear
that
if
the
court
were
to
decide
against
me,
i
do
not
think
this
would
mean
an
outright
reversal
because
the
other
five
points
we
urged
in
the
eighth
circuit
had
never
been
considered.
the
eighth
circuit
decided
for
us
on
one
of
the
six
points.
mr.
donald
w.
jones
yes,
and
--
mr.
donald
w.
jones
they
did
say
that.
they
did
not
review
the
substantial
evidence
question.
mr.
donald
w.
jones
they
did
not
review
the
constitutional
question
as
to
whether
or
not
it
is
due
process
of
law
or
a
violation
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
to
prosecute
an
employer
who
is
too
small
to
protect
under
their
jurisdiction
standard,
to
use
their
jurisdictional
standards
in
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
and
discriminatory
manner
to
prosecute
the
employer
who
is
too
small
to
protect.
they
did
not
decide
that.
and
in
fact,
while
i
am
mentioning
that
point,
the
peterson
case
that
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals'
is
squarely
on
the
point
in
my
position
on
that
point
because
that
is
--
mr.
donald
w.
jones
i
think
that
that
is
proper.
that
if
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
eighth
circuit
was
correct
on
any
grounds,
i
would
like
to
have
this
court
sustain
it
on
that
grounds
alone,
but
i
do
want
to
hasten
to
the
--
mr.
donald
w.
jones
they
passed
on
only
one
ground.
mr.
donald
w.
jones
well,
i
will
go
on
to
*
(a)
(4).
now,
there
is
no
issue
here
in
my
judgment
on
8
(a)
(1).
i
want
to
make
that
clear.
there
is
no
issue
here
on
8
(a)
(1).
i
refer
to
the
boards
decision
at
page
275
on
the
appendix.
in
these
circumstances
we
find
that
equal
and
effective
administration
of
the
process
of
the
act
require
us
to
limit
our
exercise
of
jurisdiction
to
limiting
the
section
8
(a)
(4)
violations.
the
board
did
no
assert
jurisdiction
on
8
(a)
(1).
the
board
asserted
jurisdiction
only
on
8
(a)
(4)
and
i
also
disagree
that
8
(a)
(1)
was
ever
involved
in
this
case
on
any
basis
related
to
the
8
(a)
(4)
issue
other
than
as
a
derivative
issue.
8
(a)
(4)
--
8
(a)
(1)
was
always
considered
derivative.
the
boards
decision
makes
that
clear.
this
is
standard
practice.
i
point
this
out
in
my
brief
in
our
position
to
certiorari.
mr.
donald
w.
jones
i
think
that
would
be
proper.
mr.
donald
w.
jones
alright,
thank
you
your
honor.
now,
on
the
8
(a)
(4),
we
contend
that
when
8
(a)
(4)
says
--
well,
first
of
all,
let
me
know
at
this
point.
when
we
are
considering
8
(a)
(4),
we
are
only
considering
the
portion
of
8
(a)
(4)
referring
to
testimony
under
the
act.
there
is
no
claim
here
that
any
of
the
employees
involved
gave
any
charges
under
the
act.
they
gave
the
-
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
statements
they
gave
were
testimony
and
so
we
are
not
concerned
with
any
--
whether
or
not
8
(a)
(4)
is
violating
in
regard
to
charges.
this
is
only
statements,
whether
it
is
testimony
--
whether
it
is
statements
or
testimony?
we
contend
that
the
word
testimony
as
used
by
congress
is
one
that
has
been
long
understood
by
lawyers,
legislators
and
courts.
we
cite
several
cases
of
general
application
on
the
use
of
that
word.
congress
obviously
knew
what
the
word
testimony
meant
when
they
used
it
in
the
statute.
congress
used
that
word,
they
did
not
use
the
words
statements.
they
did
not
use
the
word
of
broader
application.
they
use
a
technical,
legal
term
testimony
and
we
contend
that
the
statute
on
its
face
is
clear
and
unambiguous
and
that
it
should
be
so
read
and
that
the
eighth
circuits
interpretation
of
it
is
just
exactly
what
congress
wrote.
mr.
donald
w.
jones
the
--
i
think
the
purpose
was
exactly
what
congress
--
i
have
to
rely
on
finding
the
purpose
of
congress
upon
exactly
what
they
said.
i
think
the
purpose,
at
least
it
appears
to
me,
that
when
congress
wrote
8
(a)
(4),
they
said
the
employees
need
protection
in
two
cases,
in
two
situations.
one,
where
they
file
a
charge
and
directly
confront
their
employer,
we
do
not
want
them
to
be
fired
or
discriminated
against
because
they
filed
charges,
that
issue
is
not
here;
two,
where
they
gave
testimony
in
a
board
hearing.
now
before
and
if
you
look
at
whole
act
together,
under
a
board
hearing
when
the
charge
is
filed
and
it's
investigated
and
a
complaint
is
issued
and
notice
of
hearing.
at
the
hearing,
the
employer
has
a
right
to
appear
cross-examine
the
witnesses,
including
any
employees
who
gave
testimony,
the
employer
has
a
right
to
cross-examine.
mr.
donald
w.
jones
that
is
true.
it
is
not
set
forth
in
the
statute
how
the
board
goes
about
their
investigation
and
how
the
rules
do
--
mr.
donald
w.
jones
well,
it
is
clear
under
the
law
as
this
court
held
in
nash
versus
industrial
commission
in
florida
and
another
case,
it
is
clear
under
the
law
and
under
the
statute
that
the
board
itself
cannot
initiate
a
charge
which
incidentally,
that
is
another
point.
mr.
donald
w.
jones
a
charge
has
to
be
filed
by
some
person
and
then
the
board
investigates
as
they
deem
--
mr.
donald
w.
jones
oh!
i
do
think
he
is
protected.
i
never
did
give
in
making
that
point.
i
think
there
is
ample
protection.
congress
has
provided
a
criminal
penalty
which
is
ample
protection.
now,
if
you
say
an
employer
says
to
an
employee,
i
am
going
to
fire
you
because
you
gave
a
statement
to
the
labor
board.
well,
if
his
purpose
is
violated
8
(a)
(3),
then
that
is
protection.
however,
if
you
say
--
mr.
donald
w.
jones
in
section
12
of
the
act,
congress
provides
a
criminal
penalty
for
anyone
interfering
with
board
processes
or
the
performance
of
the
duties
of
the
labor
board
investigator
or
agent
of
any
board
member.
there
are
criminal
penalties
there.
these
provides
ample
protection
so
to
merely
construe
8
(a)
(4)
--
mr.
donald
w.
jones
i
think
it
would
be.
i
certainly
think
it
would
be
ill
advice
for
an
employer
to
do
anything
to
an
employee
that
would
be
interfering
with
the
board
agent?s
powers
if
it
were
subject
to
$5,000.00
penalty.
mr.
donald
w.
jones
yes,
there
is
obviously
and
--
mr.
donald
w.
jones
well,
it
think
it
is
--
mr.
donald
w.
jones
congress
says,
provided
--
i
think
congress
saw
that
an
employee
who
appeared
in
open
court
against
his
employer
when
his
employer
was
sitting
there
and
listening
to
every
word,
cross-examining,
the
employer
was
present,
i
think
that
is
what
congress
meant
to
protect.
mr.
donald
w.
jones
well,
if
the
employee
had
given
testimony,
he
is
protected
for
against
any
discrimination
for
that
testimony
once
the
employer
heard.
i
do
not
think
congress
meant
to
say
that
an
employer
could
be
held
guilty
of
discriminating
against
an
employee
for
something
an
employee
said
in
a
secret
statement
about
which
the
employer
has
no
knowledge.
now,
how
can
--
in
all
these
8
(a)
(4)
cases
and
i
include
the
ones
cited
by
the
petitioner
and
i
believe
in
every
one
of
them
that
i
can
recall
at
least,
there
may
be
one
or
two
exceptions
that
i
do
not
recall,
but
in
everyone
that
i
recall,
when
the
board
finds
an
8
(a)
(4)
violation,
they
find
it
on
the
basis
that
there
were
some
adverse
testimony
to
the
employer.
now,
we
do
not
--
now
on
this
record
there
is
only
one
statement
in
the
evidence
that
of
don
cockrum
(ph).
the
other
three
men
said
they
gave
statements
to
the
labor
board
investigator.
they
did
not
say
they
were
written
and
sworn.
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
other
three
gave
written
and
sworn
statements.
how
could
this
employer
know
whether
the
statements
given
were
helpful
or
harmful?
how
could
he
be
motivated
to
discriminate
against
the
employees
if
he
did
not
know
what
they
had
said
or
anything?
and
i
think
congress
--
i
think
congress
never,
never
even
considered
that
8
(a)
(4)
might
be
possibly
used
to
put
an
employer
in
a
situation
with
this
one
he
is
in.
