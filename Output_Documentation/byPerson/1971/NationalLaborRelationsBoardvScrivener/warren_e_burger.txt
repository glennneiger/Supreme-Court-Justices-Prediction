chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
excuse
me
gentlemen,
because
of
our
changing
the
position
on
the
calendar
of
the
case
just
preceding
you,
i
called
the
wrong
case.
i
called
the
fifth
one
which
will
be
not
be
reached
until
tomorrow
and
i
might
say
with
respect
to
dunkin
against
tennessee.
it
is
clear
you
will
not
be
reached
today
that
you
may
be
adjourned
until
tomorrow,
unless
you
would
like
to
hear
more
arguments
today.
and
we
will
hear
now
70-267,
national
labor
relations
board
against
scrivener.
mr.
bray
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
that
mr.
bray,
what
you
are
saying
is
that
the
giving
of
statements,
written
or
oral
to
the
investigative
line
of
the
board
is
incidental
to
the
filing
of
charges
and
both
incidental
and
preliminary
to
testifying
in
the
formal
hearing.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
the
case,
civil
or
criminal
in
the
federal
courts
or
any
other
courts
where
reprisals
of
any
kind
were
inflicted
upon
a
person
for
giving
statements
to
an
investigator,
private
or
public,
would
be
dealt
with
by
contempt
proceedings,
it
could
be
dealt
with
by
contempt
proceedings
on
the
part
of
the
judge,
could
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
you
time
is
up
mr.
bray.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
jones.
now
by
way
of
background
just
let
me
ask
you
a
broad
question
first.
is
it
not
reasonably
have
part
of
the
whole
adversary
process
to
interrogate
witnesses
before
they
are
called
into
an
adversary
proceeding?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
does
the
board
function
or
how
do
employees
get
to
cases
to
the
board
if
any
impediments
are
put
in
the
way
of
having
them
freely
give
statements
to
government
agents
who
come
and
call
on
them?
how
could
the
board
function?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what's
that
got
to
with
the
need
to
interrogate
witnesses
before
you
call
them?
you
do
not
--
lawyers
do
not
customarily
bring
witnesses
into
a
tribunal
if
they
do
not
know
what
they
are
going
to
say,
do
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
determine
whether
a
complaint
should
issue,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
are
now
arguing
mr.
jones,
the
weight
of
the
evidence.
assume
for
a
moment,
for
the
moment
that
they
were
terminated
because
they
gave
statements
to
the
labor
board
investigator?
do
you
maintain
on
that
the
eighth
circuit
reached
the
correct
decision
on
that
assumption?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
the
legal
question
involved
here
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
that
evidence,
would
you
have
much
difficulties
supporting
conclusion
that
in
fact
it
was
an
interference
with
union
activity?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
again
mr.
jones,
i
am
looking
at
the
petition
for
certiorari
here.
the
petition
was
sought
and
granted
to
determine
whether
the
discharge
of
an
employee
because
he
is
given
a
written
statement
of
the
board
during
the
investigation
is
a
violation
of
8
(a)
(1)
and
(4)
and
i
don't
think
we
need
to
go
into
any
other
matters
or
spend
any
time
on
any
other
matters?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
we
will
consider
them
and
we
will
hear
argument
within
the
framework
of
the
question
presented
by
the
petition
and
by
the
writ,
but
there
is
no
use
in
spending
time
beyond
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
whatever
you
have
there,
there
is
only
one
question
here
as
in
fact?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
come
back
to?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
just
got
about
10
minutes
left
to
cover
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.

i
think
we
have
your
points
counsel.

is
