justice
byron
r.
white
well
did
the
clause
say
that
in
which
law
would
apply?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
is
no
attempt
to
specify
a
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
normally
in
english
court,
regardlessly
of
the
location
of
an
accident
or
of
any
other
contacts
would
apply
english
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
that
include
the
english
conflict
laws?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
was
unterweser's
limitations
actions
filed?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
much
later
though.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
didn't
have
to
do
that,
did
it,
to
ultimately
prevail
on
the
issue
that's
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
only,
only
if
the
forum
question
didn't
cancel
out
the
american
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
didn't
they
pursue
that
then
from
the
time
the
district
court
first
refused
to
stay
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
was
a
limitations
action
filed?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
may
lose
it
or?
justice
byron
r.
white
wasn't
there
a
provision
in
this
contract
saying
that
unterweser
would
not
be
liable
in
any
event?
justice
byron
r.
white
clearly
here
though.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
maybe
if
zapata
would
never
have
filed
that
action,
the
english
court
might
have
been
useless.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
those
clause
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
know
whether
those
clauses
are
enforced
in
german
courts?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
the
conditions
--
is
the
call
for
bid
in
the
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
the
call
for
bids
in
the
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
any
insurance
provisions
in
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
hiring
entirely
to
make
a
tow,
is
it
characteristics
that
you
don't
specify
that
the
tower
or
the
carry
insurance?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
not
mentioned
in
this
contract.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
where
there
are
some
claims
against
unterweser
other
than
zapata?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
would
unterweser
have
filed
its
own
limitations
actions,
if
it
could
have
done
the
same
thing
in
the
zapata
suit?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
this
was
what
we
thought.
do
you
think
this
was
a
way
of
eliminating
through
this
limitations
action,
and
whether
as
you
call
a
concourse,
eliminating
every
other,
all
other
claims?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
i
mean.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
would
have
a
limited
time
to
do
so.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
that's
what
i
mean.
justice
byron
r.
white
unterweser
this
way
could
say,
anybody
else
that
has
a
claim
come
in
and
file
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
they
didn't,
that
was
the
end
of
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
obviously.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
zapata
had
followed
the
language
of
the
contract
and
had
filed
suited
in
london
--
let's
just
assume
that.
do
you
think
it
would
have
been
inconsistent
with
that
forum
clause,
or
unterweser
then
to
file
a
limitations
action
in
the
united
states
to
attempt
to
have
other
possible
claimants
file
or
surface
their
claims?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
nance,
do
you
suggest
his
position
would
have
been
any
different
had
he
done
this
by
way
of
answer
on
your
seat?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
his
position
be
any
different?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
file
--
his
answer
would
be
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
you
win
this
case,
are
you
going
to
abandon
your
limitations
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh
i
know
but
do
you
think
you
can
force
claimants
to
go
to
england?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
well,
let's
assume
some
other
claimant
came
in
here
into
this
limitations
action,
you
couldn't
terminate
it
then
could
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
that's
what
i
said.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suppose
you
are
interested
in
foreclosing
other
claimants.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
they
don't
come
into
this
limitation
action
here
in
the
united
states,
they
are
foreclosed,
aren't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
my
question
again
to
you
is
are
you
going
to
abandon
your
limitations
action
if
you
win
this
lawsuit?
justice
byron
r.
white
stayed
but
not
abandoned?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
your
claimant
and
limitation
actions
is
that
every
claimant
except
zapata
should
be
able
to
litigate
in
that
action
against
unterweser.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
say
that
for
one
claimant,
the
forum
clause
precludes
his
filing
a
claim.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
gave
zapata
notice
though
i
suppose
and
you
got
an
injunction
against
their
lawsuit.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know
they
may
get
a
notice
or
an
invitation
or
a
direction
to
file
their
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
forum
clause
would
have
prevented
you
from
bringing
the
limitations
action
in
tampa?
justice
byron
r.
white
some
of
the
claimant
had
arrested
the
ship
in
tampa
and
sued
you
and
brought
a
limitations
action
and
you
noticed
all
claimants
including
zapata,
would
you
do
that
under
the
limitation
clause?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah
they
may
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
you
could
make
zapata
come
into
the
limitations
action
if
it
had
been
filed
in
the
circumstances
i
posed.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
if
zapata
hadn't
sued
you
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i'll
put
it
this
way.
on
my
assumptions,
some
of
the
claimants
sues
you,
and
files
the
limitations
action,
and
zapata
had
filed
its
claim
there
and
you
had
objected
to
it.
could
you
have
done
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
some
other
claimant
arrests
the
ship
filed
a
limitations
action
in
response
to
that
and
then
zapata
files
this
claim
along
with
other
claimants,
you
would
say
you
could
make
zapata
go
to
london
to
litigate
his
claim.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
guess
you
have
to
say
that
in
your
position.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
it
as
small
as
$8,000?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what's
the
amount
here?
3,00
odd?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
did
the
clause
say
that
in
which
law
would
apply?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
is
no
attempt
to
specify
a
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
normally
in
english
court,
regardlessly
of
the
location
of
an
accident
or
of
any
other
contacts
would
apply
english
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
that
include
the
english
conflict
laws?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
was
unterweser's
limitations
actions
filed?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
much
later
though.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
didn't
have
to
do
that,
did
it,
to
ultimately
prevail
on
the
issue
that's
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
only,
only
if
the
forum
question
didn't
cancel
out
the
american
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
didn't
they
pursue
that
then
from
the
time
the
district
court
first
refused
to
stay
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
was
a
limitations
action
filed?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
may
lose
it
or?
justice
byron
r.
white
wasn't
there
a
provision
in
this
contract
saying
that
unterweser
would
not
be
liable
in
any
event?
justice
byron
r.
white
clearly
here
though.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
maybe
if
zapata
would
never
have
filed
that
action,
the
english
court
might
have
been
useless.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
those
clause
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
know
whether
those
clauses
are
enforced
in
german
courts?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
the
conditions
--
is
the
call
for
bid
in
the
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
the
call
for
bids
in
the
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
any
insurance
provisions
in
the

justice
byron
r.
white
but
in

entirely

is

justice

it

justice
byron

white
well,
where
there
are
some
claims
against
unterweser
other
than
zapata?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
would
unterweser

its

that's

but
they
would
have
a
limited

to
do
so.
justice
byron

white
yes,
that's
what
i
mean.
justice
byron

white
unterweser
this
way
could
say,
anybody

that

and
if

that

obviously.
justice
byron

white
let's
assume
that

had
followed
the
language
of
the
contract
and
had
filed
suited
in
london
--
let's
just
assume
that.
do
you

are

justice
byron
r.
white
oh
i
know
but
do
you
think
you
can
force
claimants
to
go
to
england?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
well,
let's
assume
some
other
claimant
came
in
here
into
this
limitations
action,
you
couldn't
terminate
it
then
could
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
that's
what
i
said.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suppose
you
are
interested
in
foreclosing
other
claimants.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
they
don't
come
into
this
limitation
action
here
in
the
united
states,
they
are
foreclosed,
aren't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
my
question
again
to
you
is
are
you
going
to
abandon
your
limitations
action
if
you
win
this
lawsuit?
justice
byron
r.
white
stayed
but
not
abandoned?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
your
claimant
and
limitation
actions
is
that
every
claimant
except
zapata
should
be
able
to
litigate
in
that
action
against
unterweser.
justice
byron

white
but
you
say
that
for
one

the
forum
clause
precludes
his
filing
a

justice
byron

white
but
you
gave
zapata

i

and
you
got
an

against
their

justice
byron

white
well
i
know
they
may
get
a

or
an

justice
byron

white
do
you
think
the

from

in
tampa?
justice
byron

white
some

had
arrested
the
ship
in
tampa
and
sued
you
and
brought
a
limitations
action
and
you
noticed
all
claimants
including
zapata,
would
you
do
that
under
the
limitation
clause?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah
they
may
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
you
could
make
zapata
come
into
the
limitations
action
if
it
had
been
filed
in
the
circumstances
i
posed.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
if
zapata
hadn't
sued
you
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i'll
put
it
this
way.
on
my
assumptions,
some
of
the
claimants
sues
you,
and
files
the
limitations
action,
and
zapata
had
filed
its
claim
there
and
you
had
objected
to
it.
could
you
have
done
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
some
other
claimant
arrests
the
ship
filed
a
limitations
action
in
response
to
that
and
then
zapata
files
this
claim
along
with
other
claimants,
you
would
say
you
could
make
zapata
go
to
london
to
litigate
his
claim.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
guess
you
have
to
say
that
in
your
position.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
it
as
small
as
$8,000?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what's
the
amount
here?
3,00
odd?
