do
i
understand
that,
that
clause
was
subject
to
negotiation
before
he
finally
agreed
upon,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
between
the
parties
there
had
been
some
discussion,
what
law
should
apply,
had
they
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
you
file
formally
petition
that
in
anyway
it
was
something
like
a
special
appearance
without
prejudice
to
your
forum
claim
under
the
contract?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

i
see.
justice
william

and
in
that
circumstances
and
under
the
british
law,
what
about
the
limitation
action,
how
would
that
come
under--?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
bisso,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
mr.
kerr,
you
are
or
are
you
satisfied
that
in
the
british
forum
proceeding,
it's
improbable
that
they
would
apply
american
law
to
bisso
on
merits
of
this
confidence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it's
either
british
or
german
law,
than
those
exculpatory
clauses
would
be
enforced
probably.
justice

it's

i
am
curious

it's
no
importance

the

this
tow,
is
there
some
–
i
am
not
getting
that
term.
justice
william
j.

what
i
don't
quite
understand,
perhaps
i
didn't
catch
mr.
nance

i
gather
your
position
is
you
may
not
now
claim
the
benefit
of
the
forum
clause.

of
what
he
did

suit?
justice
william

well,
from
that
you
conclude
that
he
may
not
now
insist
on
sending
zapata,
isn't
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

once
you
say
mr.
kerr
what's
the
status

london
proceeding?
