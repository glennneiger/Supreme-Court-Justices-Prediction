chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
bremen
and
unterweser
against
zapata
off-shore
company.
mr.
kerr
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
is
it
your
view
that
the
parties
each
having
one
national
court
to
which
it
--
for
which
it
would
have
a
preference
and
agreed
upon
a
neutral
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
would
be
the
alternatives
this
collision,
this
accident
occurred,
this
damaged
occurred
in
waters
of
no
particular
nation,
isn't
that
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
outweighed
or
balanced?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
that
appearance
by
zapata
there,
a
general
appearance
or
does
it
make
any
difference?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
prior
action
pending
where?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
the
parties
at
the
outset
had
both
acknowledged
the
forum
clause
of
the
contract,
would
you
have
been
in
the
florida
courts
at
all
in
the
united
states
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
you
are
saying,
i
take
it,
mr.
kerr's,
that
it's
hardly
reasonable
to
assume
that
the
parties
would
contract
for
british
court
if
they
intended
to
enforce
american
law,
for
example,
in
which
case
it
would
be
in
the
hands
of
judges
unfamiliar
with
it
to
american
law.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
kerr.
mr.
nance.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then
at
some
point,
i
hope
you
suggest
your
hypothesis
as
to
why
the
forum
clause
wasn't
included
and
what
the
parties
intended
by
it?
would
you
do
that
at
your
own?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
there
is
a
salvage
–
would
a
salvage
claim
be
a
claim
under
the
contract?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
anyone
who
had
picked
up
the
vessel
and
told
the
court
or
engaged
in
salvage
operations
could
bring
a
suit,
could
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
why
do
you
say,
that
it
is,
i
am
a
little
confused,
do
you
say
it's
under
the
contract
or
outside?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
say?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
before
you
kept
to
that
claim,
let
me
see
if
i
can
verify
one
of
the
things,
same
question
i
put
to
mr.
kerr.
if
your
client
had
been
sentenced
to
the
forum
clause,
and
gone
in
to
the
british
courts
would
there
be
any
proceedings
in
federal
courts
in
this
country
at
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
hypothetical.
would
there
have
been
any
occasion
for
unterweser
to
go
into
the
courts
of
the
united
states,
if
you
had
complied
with
the
forum
clause
of
the
contract
and
let
this
matter
be
resolved
in
the
british
courts.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
can
answer
that
question
right
after
the
lunch.
you
may
now
address
yourself
to
justice
rehnquist's
question.
your
wish?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
you
are
quite
right
that
he
could
have
made
these
motions,
and
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
he
was
required
to
make
them
in
order
to
protect
the
position
which
he
is
now
trying
to
protect
or
sometimes
judges
don't
entertain
motions
very
cheerfully
if
the
motion
is
telling
them
to
get
along
and
decide
some
matter.
chief
justice
warren

light
is

circumstances,
we
will
give
you
five
more
minutes

mr.

accordingly.

mr.
kerr.
chief

we
have

agreed?
chief

warren
e.
burger
you
have
offered
this.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
this
situation
different
with
respect
to
colloquy,
you
have
been
engaging
in,
from
what
it
would
be
if
instead
of
a
forum
clause
for
the
british
courts,
you
had
a
different
type
of

clause.
the

clause
with
arbitration
binding
arbitration
of
a
fixed
kind,
the
american
arbitration
association
or
what
not.
chief
justice
warren
e.

i
am
not
so
sure
if
that's
true.
one
of
the
recent
cases
which
they
have
failed
to
recognized
arbitration
clauses
with
finality
and
elimination
of
judicial
review,
but
that's
not
--
chief
justice
warren
e.

mr.
kerr,
i
know
your
time
is
up
but
may
i
just
ask
you
what's
the
difference
between

it's

what
would
