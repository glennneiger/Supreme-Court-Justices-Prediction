mr.
james
k.
nance
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
of
course,
i
have
my
problem
here
right
now
but
in
view
of
some
the
questions
that
had
been
asked
by
served
with
the
justice,
i
think
i
would
reply
to
some
of
these
questions,
so
it
will
be
sensed
fresh
in
your
mind.
as
to
the
towage
contract,
it
says
the
provision
that
the
court
was
inquiring
about,
with
reference
to
the
negotiation
for
the
forum
clause
although
mr.
bond
oswegon
(ph)
makes
a
conclusory
statement
that
he
wouldn't
have
make
the
contract,
he
is
the
manging
director
of
the
unterweser
but
for
the
forum
clause,
in
the
affidavit
which
was
before
the
trial
court
below,
regarding
the
party
that
signed
the
contract
on
behalf
of
zapata,
it
states
facts
that
after
zapata
accepted
unterweser's
there
above
mentioned,
the
contract
of
towage
was
drafted
to
unterweser
and
mailed
by
from
bremen.
zapata
and
houston,
the
draft
included
the
clause
any
dispute
arising
must
be
treated
before
the
london
court
of
justice
and
this
is
important.
before
and
after
such
draft
was
extended
to
zapata
for
acceptance,
there
were
no
discussions
between
zapata
and
unterweser
reederei
whatever
concerning
paragraph
8.
that
further,
he
also
denies
that
mr.
oswegon
(ph)
had
been
mistaken
that
the
parties
“intended
that
the
controlling
law
to
be
applied
would
below
the
forum
english
law.”
in
no
time,
they
had
found
unterweser
reederei,
discussed
or
mentioned
what
law
was
intended
to
throw
in
the
vein
of
litigation,
simply
“after
the
low
bid
by
a
telegram
was
received
and
this
is
in
the
record.
unterweser
drafted
this
clause
as
mr.
oswegon
(ph)
affidavit
says,
ordinarily
we
include
german,
an
exclusive
german
forum
clause
which
means
a
disclusion
of
any
of
them,
which
i
will
discuss
later
on
one
of
the
points
in
our
brief
and
also
we
usually
apply
the
application
of
german
law,
so
that's
a
term
of
this
record
here,
there
is
nothing
that
you
cannot
rightfully
say
that
the
parties
agreed
that
these
laws
were
applied.
mr.
james
k.
nance
sir?
mr.
james
k.
nance
yes
they
are.
well
a
call
i
am
not
sure,
your
honor,
there
are
some
telegraphic
bids
and
zapata,
--
there
are
in
the
record.
mr.
james
k.
nance
no,
zapata
is
uninsured.
this
is
an
uninsured
law,
so
paid
out
$3
millions.
mr.
james
k.
nance
no,
your
honor,
there
is
a
(inaudible),
no
attorneys
reviewed
this
that
was
--
mr.
james
k.
nance
well
they
have
-–
and
this
is
not
in
the
record,
they
must
have
the
exchange
of
telegrams
and
on
the
draft
of
the
--
i
believe
the
contract
that's
in
the
record,
it
shows
the
initial
of
hst
that's
mr.
taylor
that
signed
the
affidavit.
so
there
must
has
been
the
ones
that
they
changed,
they
do
not
pertain
to
the
forum
clause.
mr.
james
k.
nance
yes
they
did
and
they
are
the
ones
that
are
initiated
in
the
record.
mr.
james
k.
nance
well
i
don't
answer
the
facts,
that
zapata
off-shore
company
was
it's
hub
and
liability
peeling
on
and
so
forth
and
all
of
its
rigs
were
uninsured.
they
simply
were
self
--
mr.
james
k.
nance
sometimes
the
party
do
it,
sometimes
it
is
not
mentioned
in
this
contract.
mr.
james
k.
nance
just
one
more
question
and
reply
it
fair
and
i
hope
i
can
get
to
the
main
body
of
my
address,
about
the
act
of
the
law,
it's
simple
plead,
this
event
happened
between
two
nations;
an
american
and
a
german.
it
happened
on
the
high
scenes
starting
it
with
the
scotland.
it's
in
the
brief,
they
don't
challenge
it,
affirmed
by
this
court
in
the
belgenland
and
affirmed
by
the
second
circuit
in
the
gylfe
versus
the
trujillo
and
i
could
name
you
dozens
of
cases,
they
don't
challenge
it.
when
that
occurs
and
there
are
torts
involved,
the
law
of
the
forum
is
applied.
this
suit,
both
ours
and
their
limitation
is
in
the
united
states
and
it
will
apply
united
states
law
not
only
to
to
determine
the
rights
and
liabilities
but
also
under
the
titanic,
in
the
limitation
action,
the
amount
of
the
fund
is
determined
by
the
american
fund.
in
this
case
$1.4
millions,
in
england
we
are
only
to
have
recoursed
$80,000.
this
is
important
and
i
will
discuss
that
later
on
but
i
do
want
to
get
that
crystal
clear.
on
contacts,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
we
have
detailed
in
our
brief
if
the
court
wants
to
talk
about,
(inaudible),
we
have
detailed
that
this
thing
is
--
up
the
point
of
this
collision
was
that
was
all
done
in
america,
this
rig
was
carefully
prepared
here,
the
germans
inspected
it,
seaworthiness
inspections,
seaworthy
certificates
and
so
forth.
it
was
repaired
in
american
zone.
now
i
like
to
get
back
to
my
remaining
speech
on
this.
mr.
james
k.
nance
i
will
do
that.
now
just
in
order
to
get
to
the
crux
of
the
things,
the
end
results
of
this,
if
this
court
overruled
this
discretionary
order
entered
by
the
limitation
court,
in
which
he
determined
he
would
assert
and
retain
his
jurisdiction,
it
will
necessarily
relegate
zathe
product
to
london
where
under
london
law,
the
exculpatory
clauses
would
defeat
our
claim
and
the
american
law
being
applied
is
outlined
here
before
under
bisso
and
dixilyn
and
dixilyn,
that
was
the
freely
negotiated
contract
where
a
reduced
rates
were
given
for
an
exchange
for
the
exculpatory,
this
court
per
curiam
on
bisso
reversed
the
law
court
and
held
exculpatory
clauses
void
and
invalid.
now
what
we
had
here
was
a
vessel,
it
was
as
tall
as
(inaudible)
it
is
44
storeys
tall.
there
is
a
picture
of
it
in
the
brief
in
the
upright
position.
the
legs
are
44
stories
tall,
this
bank
had
been
carefully
moved
in
32
coast
wise
voyages
on
32
previous
occasions.
then
it
was
decided
to
send
the
ship
overseas
on
a
drilling
contract,
in
the
italian
sea.
special
devices
called
the
locking
devices
which
are
in
the
brief,
on
the
deck,
were
to
be
installed
on
this
huge
44
storey
leg
rig
prior
to
a
transocean
crossing,
this
rig
with
those
tall
legs
simply
cannot
take
the
road
without
the
legs
locked.
zapata
instructed
bremen
to
tow
the
vessel
coast
wise
in
250
foot
water
deeps,
so
that
in
event
of
a
bad
weather,
it
could
jack
down
its
legs,
jack-up
the
rig
and
ride
out
to
weather
as
i
am
sure
you've
heard
about
during
the
hurricane
season.
this
was
not
a
hurricane
period
but
this
is
was,
and
no
other
came
through
in
january,
instead
of
going
coast
wise
and
jacked
up
water
dips,
the
rig
was
towed
directly
across,
for
in
10,000
feet
of
water,
150
miles
from
the
nearest
jacked
up
water
dips,
250
feet,
this
bad
weather
hit,
the
legs
rolled
and
finally
all
three
broke
off.
there
is
a
picture
of
the
damaged
rig
in
the
brief.
now,
as
i
have
stated
under
american
law,
this
is
not
before
–
of
course
we
can
prove
it
but
this,
the
court
below
is
entirely
considered
the
contention
with
the
party
when
it
gets
to
around
to
determining
where
is
the
evidence
which
i
am
going
to
discuss
in
a
moment.
now
let's
put
this
–
let's
focus
in
on
what
is
at
issue
here.
here
is
a
case
where
after
we
filed
suit,
we
took,
we
noticed
and
took
25
german's
depositions
including
mr.
oswegon,
managing
director
tended
by
mr.
kerr
and
his
firm.
thereafter
they
noticed,
we
noticed
and
they
cross
noticed
and
invoking
the
jurisdiction
of
the
tampa
court
and
took
depositions
of
eight
americans
on
the
chaparral.
after
that,
invoking
the
jurisdiction
of
court
below,
they
took
more
depositions
of
the
marine
surveyors
in
new
orleans.
they
also
filed
motion
for
discovery
and
we
produced
documents
and
the
file
of
the
case,
i
could
not
put
it
all
on
this
tape,
this
case
has
been
deposed
and
it's
substantially
was
ready
for
trial
in
the
first
suit
which
we
filed
when
mr.
kerr's
client
decided
to
file
the
limitation
of
liability
procedure
and
let
me
tell
you
what
that
is,
your
honor.
he
mentioned
that
he
made
a
special
appearance
when
he
filed
it.
we
will
just
read
the
complaint.
under
our
rules
of
practice,
you
cannot
make
a
special
appearance
in
going
and
filing
a
lawsuit.
let
me
tell
you
what
a
limitation
liability
proceeding
is.
under
181,
of
46
us
code,
congress
provides
that
a
ship
owner
may
limit
his
liability
to
the
value
of
the
vessel
as
he
can
show
us
not
a
fault.
183
provides,
it
may
file
its
own
proceeding,
a
limitation
liability
proceeding,
that
does
so
within
six
months
after
of
notice
of
written
claim,
and
assert
that
it
is
entitled
to
limit
its
liability
to
the
value
of
the
vessel.
rule
f
of
the
rules,
supplemental
rules,
civil
procedure
elaborate
upon
that
procedure
and
spells
out
in
quite
detail
which
we
will
mention
in
our
brief
as
to
the
procedure
that
he
needs
to
go
through.
not
only
does
rule
f
allow
the
petitioner
ship
owner
to
assert
that
he
is
(inaudible)
to
liability,
but
he
is
entitled
to
claim
he
is
exonerated
from
any
and
everybody's
claim.
now
what
happened
here
is
this.
he
could
have
filed
this
indefensively
as
the
courts
have
held,
it
is
cited
in
the
brief,
this
case
doesn't
turn
on
that.
what
he
did
was,
was
to
file
this
suit,
and
in
the
suit,
he
claimed
these
things.
it
was
all
the
fault
of
the
chaparral,
that
there
were
other
potential
claimants,
and
the
crew
members
that
were
on
there,
were
somewhat
hurt
getting
off.
and
he
wanted
a
concourse,
where
all
these
claims
could
come
into
the
suit.
he
got
an
injunction
out
and
he
enjoined
the
suit
that
was
being
litigated
in
the
tampa
district
court,
enjoined
it
and
cited
us
zapata
to
come
in
and
file
our
claim,
it
will
be
served
with
the
main
issue.
he
is
the
plaintiff,
and
we
are
the
defendant.
now
what
is
this
proceeding,
it's
most
important,
your
honor,
that
you
look
at
this
forum
clause
in
the
context
of
the
litigation
that's
before
you.
there
is
not
before
you
what
the
trial
court
did,
that
is
the
ruling
in
the
zapata's
first
filed
suit,
denying
their
motion
to
dismiss
the
jurisdiction
stay.
what
they
did
in
their
own
suit
was
to
file
a
motion
to
stay
the
prosecution
of
our
claim.
now,
if
you
look
to
this
court's
decision
in
british
transport,
it
is
cited
in
the
briefs,
there
you
had
the
question
of
united
states
owning
one
vessel
following
a
limitation
proceeding.
british
transport
commission
had
vessel
in
collision
with.
it
came
in
and
filed
a
claim.
other
parties
came
in
and
filed
claims,
there
being
a
concourse
here.
mr.
james
k.
nance
no,
your
honor,
there
have
been
no
claims
filed
in
the
suit
up
to
this
point.
mr.
james
k.
nance
because
your
honor
in
the
event
some
other
claimants
were
to
file
a
separate
suit
against
them
then
6
months
had
having
run,
then
of
course
they
would
--
mr.
james
k.
nance
no
your
honor,
it
was
to
provide
that
if
anybody
else
wanted
to
come
in
--
mr.
james
k.
nance
--
and
do
it,
they
could
so
--
mr.
james
k.
nance
and
the
procedure
your
honor,
the
court
sets
a
time.
mr.
james
k.
nance
but
no
order
of
--
mr.
james
k.
nance
that's
right.
mr.
james
k.
nance
well,
actually,
there
are
no
other
claims
filed,
but
other
people
could
come
in
and
they
can
file
one
out
because
no
order
of
default
has
been
entered.
mr.
james
k.
nance
but
let
me
address
myself
to
this
point.
in
the
british
transport
case
this
court
categorized
the
limitation
proceeding
as
one,
that
constitutes
it
as
a
cross
liable
between
it
and
the
claimant.
that
was
one
of
the
case
where
the
claimant
british
transport
was
cross-claimed
against
by
other
claimants,
it
was
crossed
claimed
against
by
the
(inaudible)
petitioner.
and
this
court
was
confronted
with
a
contention
that
the
petitioner
couldn't
do
that,
said
that
everybody
that's
in
it
could
cross
claim
and
sue
each
other,
but
the
point
out
of
it
is,
is
that
in
this
case
the
petitioner
here
has
submitted
himself
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
there
is
no
rule
providing
for
any
special
appearance.
the
basis
of
motion
this
day
is
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
forum
clause.
he
is
set
on
an
entitled
exoneration
from
the
world,
he
says
that
i
am
entitled
to
limit
my
liability.
he
had
sued
us
and
he
had
filed
this
and
come
in
there
and
we
have
cross
claim.
we
have
filed
our
comments
now.
he
also
counter
claimed
against
us,
for
everything
that
he
had
filed
in
the
london
suit.
in
addition,
he
put
it
in
not
in
terms
of
breach
of
contract,
but
in
terms
of
towage.
and
furthermore,
he
filed
a
brand
new
thing
called
salvage.
the
salvage
claim
in
count
two.
he
claims
that
everything
that
happened
after,
after
the
legs
were
lost,
was
outside
the
contract,
that
he,
in
other
words,
as
if
were
stranger,
he
came
up
to
rig,
cut
a
line
on
it
and
tow
this
into
nearest
port
of
refuge.
he
was
asked
for
the
admiral
court
below
to
give
him
an
award
for
salvage.
well
the
vessel
was
worth
about
$
three
million
dollars
after
rig,
and
it's
not
unusual
for
an
admiral
court
to
give,
say
10%
or
something
like
that,
like
that
would
amount
to
$300,000.
point
is,
may
it
please
the
court,
is
that
he
submitted
himself
voluntarily
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
below.
mr.
james
k.
nance
they
have
alleged
specifically
your
honor,
that
it
rose
outside
the
contract.
mr.
james
k.
nance
yes,
your
honor,
they
could
make
a
claim
for
salvage
if
they
rescued
a
rig
vessel
at
sea.
mr.
james
k.
nance
they
claim
it
was
outside
the
contract.
mr.
james
k.
nance
well,
we
deny
but
that's
for
the
court
to
decide.
i
am
saying
to
you,
your
honor,
he
has
submitted
himself
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
limitation
court
in
filing
the
counter
claims,
and
particularly
the
one
where
he
filed
a
counter
claim
for
salvage,
and
he
has
asked
this
court
here
to
give
him
a
fund
of
recovery.
mr.
james
k.
nance
well.
mr.
justice
white
whatever
they
wanted
to
do,
they
could
do
the
question
for
this
court
is
having
submitted
himself
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
limitation
court,
and
having
invoked
it,
he
is
now
--
asking
a
firm
to
relief
on
exoneration
liability
period,
asking
for
limited
liability,
and
counter
claiming,
he
has
thereby
fully
submitted
himself
to
the
court,
and
he
is
not
in
a
position
to
say,
just
because
of
the
forum
clause
don't
let
zapata
try
its
claim.
mr.
james
k.
nance
it's
meaningless.
your
honor
he
submitted
himself
or
he
hasn't,
i
want
to
call
attention
to
two
decisions
of
this
court
where
a
counter
claim
was
filed--
mr.
james
k.
nance
your
honor,
if
we
had
submitted
ourself
over
there,
if
we
had,
and
we
still
wouldn't,
we
have
a
right
to
sue
over
here,
we
certainly
have
a
right
to
sue
--
mr.
james
k.
nance
well
i
don't
believe
that
they
would
have
done
it,
your
honor
no
sir,
if
we
ruled
our
litigating,
that
case
is
not
even
at
issue.
that
there
is
nothing
been
done
about
the
case,
no
depositions
has
been
taken,
it
just
sitting
there.
mr.
james
k.
nance
but
they
could
have
filed
wherever
they
would
could
find
zapata
which
is
it's
used
to
and
that's
where
their
bases
--
mr.
james
k.
nance
what
who
should
have
done
mr.
justice?
mr.
james
k.
nance
if
you
would
repeat
it?
mr.
james
k.
nance
well
i'll
try
to
answer
this
way
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
of
course
this
was
stated,
they
had
the
privilege
they
wanted
to
assert
it
to
assert
their
--
the
liability
defenses
to
us
to
in
the
first
filed
suit
by
zapata.
now,
well,
before
we
filed
a
limitation
action
on
july
2,
this
case
has
been
pending
several
months.
as
i've
stated
our
litigating
by
taking
deposition
and
so
forth.
the
counsel
for
unterweser
had
all
the
opportunity
in
the
world
to
file
a
motion
with
the
district
court
and
acquiesce
him
--
your
honor
i
need
to
know
whether
you
are
going
to
overrule
my
motion
to
jurisdiction,
are
you
going
to
grant
them
because
i
got
to
make
a
decision
whether
or
not
i
need
to
file
my
limitation
of
liability
proceeding.
the
docket
entries
in
the
the
record
show
that
no
such
motion
were
made
and
i
am
certain
that
the
district
court,
like
any
other
judges
where
he's
advised
of
the
situation
would
such
a
motion
had
been
presented
you
would
have
ruled
on
these
things
in
order
to
accord
been
them
the
opportunity,
one
of
two
things,
they
could
plead
defensively
if
he
overruled
their
motion
of
jurisdiction,
or
as
they
have
the
privilege
to
do
and
they
were
under
no
legal
compulsion
to
do
they
could
have
filed
which
they
did
do
the
suit
which
is
before
this
court
today.
mr.
james
k.
nance
yes
sir.
mr.
james
k.
nance
no
sir,
the
record
shows
that
after
we
filed
our
lawsuit,
that
decision
had
been
taken,
they
filed
a
motion
to
address
the
court's
jurisdiction
saying
one;
that
it
lacked
jurisdiction
because
the
forum
clause.
well
that
was
overruled
probably
because
no
private
parties
cannot
fashion
their
own
private
rules
of
jurisdiction.
parties
by
contract
cannot
say
what
the
federal
court,
or
what
the
state
court's
jurisdiction
will
be,
either
it's
taken
jurisdiction
as
to
the
subject
matter,
that
was
presented
and
ultimately
it
was
overruled.
in
that
proceeding
they
filed
a
motion
to
stay,
and
to
decline
jurisdiction
on
the
ground
of
forum
non
convenience.
the
court
on
july
29th,
after
they
had
already
filed
a
limitation
action
on
july
2nd
overruled
those
motions.
so
those
motions
were
represented
to
the
court
and
you
overruled.
so
he
has
entered
two
orders
in
this
court
your
honor.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
an
order
overruling
the
motions
in
the
zapata's
first
filed
suit
addressed
to
the
jurisdiction.
and
he
is
overruled
a
motion
to
stay
which
is
what
is
before
this
court
today.
mr.
james
k.
nance
well,
it
certainly
was
a
---
it's
a
motion
that
he
couldn't
make
and
he
did
not
know
so
i
had
couldn't
project
what
you
do.
i
just
presume
that
the
court
would
move
on
with
such
motion
but
your
honor,
that
bags
the
issue
i
think
because
there
is
no
legal
compulsion
for
him
to
file
this
limitation
liability
proceeding.
he
did
it
for
two
reasons.
one
was
to
get
the
injunction
out
to
stop
the
litigation
in
the
first
filed
suit
of
zapata.
secondly,
if
he
claims
in
his
petition,
he
says,
i
fear
the
falling
of
other
suits.
however
there
were
seamen
on
our
rig
that
this
was
a
terrible
accident
and
they
were
flooded,
the
compartments,
they
were
sinking,
they
got
off,
they
came
back,
pumped
it
out
and
so
there
were
people
who
got
hurt.
he
shows
in
his
limitation
proceeding,
i
fear
the
filing
of
other
claims.
now,
one
of
the
purposes
of
limitation
proceeding
is
as
here
by
the
cases
are
cited
in
brief
is
to
provide
a
concourse
not
only
for
the
claim
for
he
has
sued
us
in
the
limitation
because
he
did,
he
got
off
the
monitions.
it
come
into
this
court
but
in
order
to
bring
in
to
concourse,
the
claimants
who
got
hurt
on
the
rig.
and
by
doing
that
he
has
only
one,
they
get
just
one
piece
of
pie
they
can
slice.
the
value
of
the
tug
which
is
$1,390,000
here.
and
that
is
--
this
is
most
important
your
honor
if
you
read
(inaudible)
that
says
the
purpose
of
limitation
proceeding
being
an
equitable
one
is
one
to
bring
all
controversies
into
one
so
that
the
court
can
administer
and
dispose
off
any
counter
controversy.
that
case
has
been
cited
in
the
british
transport
case
saying
where
they
said
a
limitation
proceeding
is
a
cost
liable,
against
the
claimant
and
so
your
honor
i
submit
that
he
has
invoked
it,
it's
here,
i'll
admit.
he
is
nothing
--
mr.
james
k.
nance
he
could
have
pleaded,
your
honor.
mr.
james
k.
nance
the
difference
your
honor
would
be
that
if
these
seamen,
american
seamen,
sued
him
for
jones
act
where
there
is
a
third
party
case,
of
course
if
he
hadn't
filed
within
six
months.
mr.
james
k.
nance
well,
under
the
case
your
honor
he
can
file
his
answer
under
the
case
i've
cited
in
the
brief,
he
can
file
those
at
any
time
before
they
go
to
trial.
i
can
hear
the
defense,
he
always
got
the
question
of
notice,
i
mean
--
mr.
james
k.
nance
no,
i
am
not
going
to
get
that
straight.
he
has
imperatives
addressed
this
equity
court
to
say
your
honor
in
whatever
state
it
is
send
zapata
away
there.
i
do
not
think
as
a
matter
of
his
way
he
did,
the
point
is
he
has
invoked
and
submitted
himself
to
this
equitable
court,
asking
for
exonerations
from
liabilites
not
only
to
us
but
to
the
world
and
also
saying
--
mr.
james
k.
nance
so
inconsistent
possession
to
say
that
i
here
invoke
the
court's
jurisdiction
and
now
we're
there
but
i
counterclaim
and
sue
and
your
honor
--
mr.
james
k.
nance
yes,
and
i'm
coming
to
discuss
[voice
overlap]
when
i
say
what
i
think
is
the
proper
interpretation
of
the
–
oh
is
my
light
off?
mr.
james
k.
nance
may
i
have
5
minutes,
your
honor?
mr.
james
k.
nance
i
don't
want
to
get
to
that
and
i
would
hope
you
would
give
me
five
minutes
your
honor.
this
is
a
–
we
have
been
litigating
this
case
for
four
years,
and
i'm
sorry,
i
mean
i
think
i
could
give
my
speech
in
30
minutes.
i
appreciate
and
the
court
should
ask
me
anything
it
wishes
and
i
want
to
answer
your
question
--
mr.
james
k.
nance
thank
you.
i
want
to
base
--
these
two
supreme
court
cases
are
not
in
my
brief
and
one
decided
by
mr.
justice
douglas,
freeman
v.
bee
machine
co.
in
1943,
that's
319
u.s.
448
where
this
court
held
that
a
defendant
found
a
counter
claim,
he
submitted
in
both
the
jurisdictions
of
the
court
and
submitted
himself
for
purposes
of
which
he
was
there.
mr.
james
k.
nance
that
was
not
a
forum
clause,
no
sir.
mr.
james
k.
nance
well,
yes
--
well,
it
does
in
this
sense
your
honor
because
we
are
not
taking
position
that
the
decision
that
the
forum
clause
has
been
--
he
is
already
entitled
to
assert
it,
but
the
limitation
core
sitting
in
(inaudible)
had
to
take
in
consideration
all
the
factors
which
are
fixed
and
discussed
on
the
reason
list
of
the
forum
clause
in
just
a
moment.
mr.
james
k.
nance
alright
sir,
the
other
case
relied
upon
in
that
case
was
merchants
heat
&
light
co.
v.
james
b.
clow
&
sons.,
204
u.s.
286
for
the
court
held
that
the
filing
of
a
counter
claim
thus
is
that
he
waived
all
objections
to
the
jurisdiction
if
it's
good
for
that,
it
certainly
won't
say
he
has
waived
his
right
to
assert
that
we
should
be
sent
somewhere,
but
the
rational
of
the
case
is
en
banc.
now,
i
want
to
address
myself
now
quickly.
the
forum
clause
reads,
any
dispute
arising
must
be
treated
before
the
london
court
of
justice.
a
forum
clause
was
strictly
construed
in
this
court
in
the
carbon
black
v.
monrosa
case
cited
in
the
brief.
here
that
clause
was
drafted
by
the
german
company
having
usually
but
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
provisions
in
it.
they
did
not
in
this
case
and
we
submit
in
the
guided
fully
brief
here
that,
that
forum
clause
being
non-exclusive
in
nature
should
not
be
a
bar
to
preclude
zapata
from
prosecuting
it's
counterclaim
in
this
suit.
i
think
the
court
has
called
upon
to
pass
upon
that.
now
turning
to
this
question,
the
waving
authority
in
this
country
is
that
forum
clauses
are
unenforceable.
all
cases
hold
that
there
are
avoided
against
by
the
(inaudible)
and
so
far
as
they
attempt
to
deprive
or
defeat
any
court
of
its
jurisdiction.
there
are
a
line
of
cases
referred
to
as
a
modern
rule
starting
in
the
second
circuit
william
h.
muller
and
other
citied
in
the
brief
here
which
say
that
under
appropriate
set
of
circumstances,
a
court
may
decline
to
assert
its
jurisdiction
in
a
case
where
there
is
a
forum
clause
involved.
and
they
look
at
these
factors
and
mr.
kerr
in
urging
this
on
the
court,
said
to
the
court
among
other
facts
that
you
can
consider,
is
whether
or
not
the
plaintiff,
we
were
plaintiff
there
at
that
stage,
would
be
deprived
of
this
remedy
if
you
were
relegated
to
the
forum
court.
in
the
second
circuit
after
this
reasonable
--
the
forum
clause
maybe
enforced
if
reasonable.
the
case
is
on
there
head
in
situation
cited
in
the
brief
that
where
the
plaintiff
would
be
deprived
of
his
remedy
in
the
jurisdictional
forum,
stipulated
forum,
that
in
that
instances
that
is
a
proper
consideration
and
that
they
could
keep
the
case.
now
the
reasonableness
of
this
thing
and
we
have
covered
this
clearly,
where
they
include
nationalities
of
the
the
parties,
place
to
form
the
contract,
deprivation
of
remedy
and
then
the
balance
of
convenience
of
the
trial.
and
i
am
hoping
to
clear
this
in
one
moment.
the
trial
court
found
that
the
balance
of
convenience
is
strong
in
his
forum,
all
the
evidence
of
the
zapata
liability,
and
damages
is
in
the
merits
about
forum
depositions
of
40
witness.
toed
because
of
tremendous
amount
of
repairs
and
liability.
all
the
evidence
is
to
the
german
unterweser
as
to
toe
line
approach
is
in
florida
where
there
is
survey.
the
salvage
suit
testimony
has
been
taken
but
a
deposition,
is
to
what
the
service
it
was
done.
that
preserved
the
depositions
of
florida.
the
only
thing
that
we
will
have
to
calculate
would
be
the
hire
of
the
tug
which
it
didn't
get
because
it
didn't
finish
the
voyage.
i
think
it's
most
important
that
this
court
in
deciding
the
case
that
i
do
believe
you
would
find
it,
the
worse
of
a
standpoint
that
the
forums
clause
is
not
enforceable,
ipso
facto,
no
case
holds
that.
they
all
say
you
must
--
the
court
must
look
at
all
the
circumstances
and
we
have
detailed
very
much
in
our
brief
all
of
those
sayings
and
there
is
a
fact
time
with
courts
that
the
balance
of
convenience
is
strongly
there.
this
is
an
equity
court,
he
exercised
his
best
judgment
where
he
should
do
on
the
circumstances
and
i
don't
think
that
the
unterwerser
has
shown
to
this
court
any
abuse
of
that
discretion,
i
thank
you.
mr.
james
k.
nance
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
of
course,
i
have
my
problem
here
right
now
but
in
view
of
some
the
questions
that
had
been
asked
by
served
with
the
justice,
i
think
i
would
reply
to
some
of
these
questions,
so
it
will
be
sensed
fresh
in
your
mind.
as
to
the
towage
contract,
it
says
the
provision
that
the
court
was
inquiring
about,
with
reference
to
the
negotiation
for
the
forum
clause
although
mr.
bond
oswegon
(ph)
makes
a
conclusory
statement
that
he
wouldn't
have
make
the
contract,
he
is
the
manging
director
of
the
unterweser
but
for
the
forum
clause,
in
the
affidavit
which
was
before
the
trial
court
below,
regarding
the
party
that
signed
the
contract
on
behalf
of
zapata,
it
states
facts
that
after
zapata
accepted
unterweser's
there
above
mentioned,
the
contract
of
towage
was
drafted
to
unterweser
and
mailed
by
from
bremen.
zapata
and
houston,
the
draft
included
the
clause
any
dispute
arising
must
be
treated
before
the
london
court
of
justice
and
this
is
important.
before
and
after
such
draft
was
extended
to
zapata
for
acceptance,
there
were
no
discussions
between
zapata
and
unterweser
reederei
whatever
concerning
paragraph
8.
that
further,
he
also
denies
that
mr.
oswegon
(ph)
had
been
mistaken
that
the
parties
“intended
that
the
controlling
law
to
be
applied
would
below
the
forum
english
law.”
in
no
time,
they
had
found
unterweser
reederei,
discussed
or
mentioned
what
law
was
intended
to
throw
in
the
vein
of
litigation,
simply
“after
the
low
bid
by
a
telegram
was
received
and
this
is
in
the
record.
unterweser
drafted
this
clause
as
mr.
oswegon
(ph)
affidavit
says,
ordinarily
we
include
german,
an
exclusive
german
forum
clause
which
means
a
disclusion
of
any
of
them,
which
i
will
discuss
later
on
one
of
the
points
in
our
brief
and
also
we
usually
apply
the
application
of
german
law,
so
that's
a
term
of
this
record
here,
there
is
nothing
that
you
cannot
rightfully
say
that
the
parties
agreed
that
these
laws
were
applied.
mr.
james
k.
nance
sir?
mr.
james
k.
nance
yes
they
are.
well
a
call
i
am
not
sure,
your
honor,
there
are
some
telegraphic
bids
and
zapata,
--
there
are
in
the
record.
mr.
james
k.
nance
no,
zapata
is
uninsured.
this
is
an
uninsured
law,
so
paid
out
$3
millions.
mr.
james
k.
nance
no,
your
honor,
there
is
a
(inaudible),
no
attorneys
reviewed
this
that
was
--
mr.
james
k.
nance
well
they
have
-–
and
this
is
not
in
the
record,
they
must
have
the
exchange
of
telegrams
and
on
the
draft
of
the
--
i
believe
the
contract
that's
in
the
record,
it
shows
the
initial
of
hst
that's
mr.
taylor
that
signed
the
affidavit.
so
there
must
has
been
the
ones
that
they
changed,
they
do
not
pertain
to
the
forum
clause.
mr.
james
k.
nance
yes
they
did
and
they
are
the
ones
that
are
initiated
in
the
record.
mr.
james
k.
nance
well
i
don't
answer
the
facts,
that
zapata
off-shore
company
was
it's
hub
and
liability
peeling
on
and
so
forth
and
all
of
its
rigs
were
uninsured.
they
simply
were
self
--
mr.
james
k.
nance
sometimes
the
party
do
it,
sometimes
it
is
not
mentioned
in
this
contract.
mr.
james
k.
nance
just
one
more
question
and
reply
it
fair
and
i
hope
i
can
get
to
the
main
body
of
my
address,
about
the
act
of
the
law,
it's
simple
plead,
this
event
happened
between
two
nations;
an
american
and
a
german.
it
happened
on
the
high
scenes
starting
it
with
the
scotland.
it's
in
the
brief,
they
don't
challenge
it,
affirmed
by
this
court
in
the
belgenland
and
affirmed
by
the
second
circuit
in
the
gylfe
versus
the
trujillo
and
i
could
name
you
dozens
of
cases,
they
don't
challenge
it.
when
that
occurs
and
there
are
torts
involved,
the
law
of
the
forum
is
applied.
this
suit,
both
ours
and
their
limitation
is
in
the
united
states
and
it
will
apply
united
states
law
not
only
to
to
determine
the
rights
and
liabilities
but
also
under
the
titanic,
in
the
limitation
action,
the
amount
of
the
fund
is
determined
by
the
american
fund.
in
this
case
$1.4
millions,
in
england
we
are
only
to
have
recoursed
$80,000.
this
is
important
and
i
will
discuss
that
later
on
but
i
do
want
to
get
that
crystal
clear.
on
contacts,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
we
have
detailed
in
our
brief
if
the
court
wants
to
talk
about,
(inaudible),
we
have
detailed
that
this
thing
is
--
up
the
point
of
this
collision
was
that
was
all
done
in
america,
this
rig
was
carefully
prepared
here,
the
germans
inspected
it,
seaworthiness
inspections,
seaworthy
certificates
and
so
forth.
it
was
repaired
in
american
zone.
now
i
like
to
get
back
to
my
remaining
speech
on
this.
mr.
james
k.
nance
i
will
do
that.
now
just
in
order
to
get
to
the
crux
of
the
things,
the
end
results
of
this,
if
this
court
overruled
this
discretionary
order
entered
by
the
limitation
court,
in
which
he
determined
he
would
assert
and
retain
his
jurisdiction,
it
will
necessarily
relegate
zathe
product
to
london
where
under
london
law,
the
exculpatory
clauses
would
defeat
our
claim
and
the
american
law
being
applied
is
outlined
here
before
under
bisso
and
dixilyn
and
dixilyn,
that
was
the
freely
negotiated
contract
where
a
reduced
rates
were
given
for
an
exchange
for
the
exculpatory,
this
court
per
curiam
on
bisso
reversed
the
law
court
and
held
exculpatory
clauses
void
and
invalid.
now
what
we
had
here
was
a
vessel,
it
was
as
tall
as
(inaudible)
it
is
44
storeys
tall.
there
is
a
picture
of
it
in
the
brief
in
the
upright
position.
the
legs
are
44
stories
tall,
this
bank
had
been
carefully
moved
in
32
coast
wise
voyages
on
32
previous
occasions.
then
it
was
decided
to
send
the
ship
overseas
on
a
drilling
contract,
in
the
italian
sea.
special
devices
called
the
locking
devices
which
are
in
the
brief,
on
the
deck,
were
to
be
installed
on
this
huge
44
storey
leg
rig
prior
to
a
transocean
crossing,
this
rig
with
those
tall
legs
simply
cannot
take
the
road
without
the
legs
locked.
zapata
instructed
bremen
to
tow
the
vessel
coast
wise
in
250
foot
water
deeps,
so
that
in
event
of
a
bad
weather,
it
could
jack
down
its
legs,
jack-up
the
rig
and
ride
out
to
weather
as
i
am
sure
you've
heard
about
during
the
hurricane
season.
this
was
not
a
hurricane
period
but
this
is
was,
and
no
other
came
through
in
january,
instead
of
going
coast
wise
and
jacked
up
water
dips,
the
rig
was
towed
directly
across,
for
in
10,000
feet
of
water,
150
miles
from
the
nearest
jacked
up
water
dips,
250
feet,
this
bad
weather
hit,
the
legs
rolled
and
finally
all
three
broke
off.
there
is
a
picture
of
the
damaged
rig
in
the
brief.
now,
as
i
have
stated
under
american
law,
this
is
not
before
–
of
course
we
can
prove
it
but
this,
the
court
below
is
entirely
considered
the
contention
with
the
party
when
it
gets
to
around
to
determining
where
is
the
evidence
which
i
am
going
to
discuss
in
a
moment.
now
let's
put
this
–
let's
focus
in
on
what
is
at
issue
here.
here
is
a
case
where
after
we
filed
suit,
we
took,
we
noticed
and
took
25
german's
depositions
including
mr.
oswegon,
managing
director
tended
by
mr.
kerr
and
his
firm.
thereafter
they
noticed,
we
noticed
and
they
cross
noticed
and
invoking
the
jurisdiction
of
the
tampa
court
and
took
depositions
of
eight
americans
on
the
chaparral.
after
that,
invoking
the
jurisdiction
of
court
below,
they
took
more
depositions
of
the
marine
surveyors
in
new
orleans.
they
also
filed
motion
for
discovery
and
we
produced
documents
and
the
file
of
the
case,
i
could
not
put
it
all
on
this
tape,
this
case
has
been
deposed
and
it's
substantially
was
ready
for
trial
in
the
first
suit
which
we
filed
when
mr.
kerr's
client
decided
to
file
the
limitation
of
liability
procedure
and
let
me
tell
you
what
that
is,
your
honor.
he
mentioned
that
he
made
a
special
appearance
when
he
filed
it.
we
will
just
read
the
complaint.
under
our
rules
of
practice,
you
cannot
make
a
special
appearance
in
going
and
filing
a
lawsuit.
let
me
tell
you
what
a
limitation
liability
proceeding
is.
under
181,
of
46
us
code,
congress
provides
that
a
ship
owner
may
limit
his
liability
to
the
value
of
the
vessel
as
he
can
show
us
not
a
fault.
183
provides,
it
may
file
its
own
proceeding,
a
limitation
liability
proceeding,
that
does
so
within
six
months
after
of
notice
of
written
claim,
and
assert
that
it
is
entitled
to
limit
its
liability
to
the
value
of
the
vessel.
rule
f
of
the
rules,
supplemental
rules,
civil
procedure
elaborate
upon
that
procedure
and
spells
out
in
quite
detail
which
we
will
mention
in
our
brief
as
to
the
procedure
that
he
needs
to
go
through.
not
only
does
rule
f
allow
the
petitioner
ship
owner
to
assert
that
he
is
(inaudible)
to
liability,
but
he
is
entitled
to
claim
he
is
exonerated
from
any
and
everybody's
claim.
now
what
happened
here
is
this.
he
could
have
filed
this
indefensively
as
the
courts
have
held,
it
is
cited
in
the
brief,
this
case
doesn't
turn
on
that.
what
he
did
was,
was
to
file
this
suit,
and
in
the
suit,
he
claimed
these
things.
it
was
all
the
fault
of
the
chaparral,
that
there
were
other
potential
claimants,
and
the
crew
members
that
were
on
there,
were
somewhat
hurt
getting
off.
and
he
wanted
a
concourse,
where
all
these
claims
could
come
into
the
suit.
he
got
an
injunction
out
and
he
enjoined
the
suit
that
was
being
litigated
in
the
tampa
district
court,
enjoined
it
and
cited
us
zapata
to
come
in
and
file
our
claim,
it
will
be
served
with
the
main
issue.
he
is
the
plaintiff,
and
we
are
the
defendant.
now
what
is
this
proceeding,
it's
most
important,
your
honor,
that
you
look
at
this
forum
clause
in
the
context
of
the
litigation
that's
before
you.
there
is
not
before
you
what
the
trial
court
did,
that
is
the
ruling
in
the
zapata's
first
filed
suit,
denying
their
motion
to
dismiss
the
jurisdiction
stay.
what
they
did
in
their
own
suit
was
to
file
a
motion
to
stay
the
prosecution
of
our
claim.
now,
if
you
look
to
this
court's
decision
in
british
transport,
it
is
cited
in
the
briefs,
there
you
had
the
question
of
united
states
owning
one
vessel
following
a
limitation
proceeding.
british
transport
commission
had
vessel
in
collision
with.
it
came
in
and
filed
a
claim.
other
parties
came
in
and
filed
claims,
there
being
a
concourse
here.
mr.
james
k.
nance
no,
your
honor,
there
have
been
no
claims
filed
in
the
suit
up
to
this
point.
mr.
james
k.
nance
because
your
honor
in
the
event
some
other
claimants
were
to
file
a
separate
suit
against
them
then
6
months
had
having
run,
then
of
course
they
would
--
mr.
james
k.
nance
no
your
honor,
it
was
to
provide
that
if
anybody
else
wanted
to
come
in
--
mr.
james
k.
nance
--
and
do
it,
they
could
so
--
mr.
james
k.
nance
and
the
procedure
your
honor,
the
court
sets
a
time.
mr.
james
k.
nance
but
no
order
of
--
mr.
james
k.
nance
that's
right.
mr.
james
k.
nance
well,
actually,
there
are
no
other
claims
filed,
but
other
people
could
come
in
and
they
can
file
one
out
because
no
order
of
default
has
been
entered.
mr.
james
k.
nance
but
let
me
address
myself
to
this
point.
in
the
british
transport
case
this
court
categorized
the
limitation
proceeding
as
one,
that
constitutes
it
as
a
cross
liable
between
it
and
the
claimant.
that
was
one
of
the
case
where
the
claimant
british
transport
was
cross-claimed
against
by
other
claimants,
it
was
crossed
claimed
against
by
the
(inaudible)
petitioner.
and
this
court
was
confronted
with
a
contention
that
the
petitioner
couldn't
do
that,
said
that
everybody
that's
in
it
could
cross
claim
and
sue
each
other,
but
the
point
out
of
it
is,
is
that
in
this
case
the
petitioner
here
has
submitted
himself
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
there
is
no
rule
providing
for
any
special
appearance.
the
basis
of
motion
this
day
is
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
forum
clause.
he
is
set
on
an
entitled
exoneration
from
the
world,
he
says
that
i
am
entitled
to
limit
my
liability.
he
had
sued
us
and
he
had
filed
this
and
come
in
there
and
we
have
cross
claim.
we
have
filed
our
comments
now.
he
also
counter
claimed
against
us,
for
everything
that
he
had
filed
in
the
london
suit.
in
addition,
he
put
it
in
not
in
terms
of
breach
of
contract,
but
in
terms
of
towage.
and
furthermore,
he
filed
a
brand
new
thing
called
salvage.
the
salvage
claim
in
count
two.
he
claims
that
everything
that
happened
after,
after
the
legs
were
lost,
was
outside
the
contract,
that
he,
in
other
words,
as
if
were
stranger,
he
came
up
to
rig,
cut
a
line
on
it
and
tow
this
into
nearest
port
of
refuge.
he
was
asked
for
the
admiral
court
below
to
give
him
an
award
for
salvage.
well
the
vessel
was
worth
about
$
three
million
dollars
after
rig,
and
it's
not
unusual
for
an
admiral
court
to
give,
say
10%
or
something
like
that,
like
that
would
amount
to
$300,000.
point
is,
may
it
please
the
court,
is
that
he
submitted
himself
voluntarily
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
below.
mr.
james
k.
nance
they
have
alleged
specifically
your
honor,
that
it
rose
outside
the
contract.
mr.
james
k.
nance
yes,
your
honor,
they
could
make
a
claim
for
salvage
if
they
rescued
a
rig
vessel
at
sea.
mr.
james
k.
nance
they
claim
it
was
outside
the
contract.
mr.
james
k.
nance
well,
we
deny
but
that's
for
the
court
to
decide.
i
am
saying
to
you,
your
honor,
he
has
submitted
himself
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
limitation
court
in
filing
the
counter
claims,
and
particularly
the
one
where
he
filed
a
counter
claim
for
salvage,
and
he
has
asked
this
court
here
to
give
him
a
fund
of
recovery.
mr.
james
k.
nance
well.
mr.
justice
white
whatever
they
wanted
to
do,
they
could
do
the
question
for
this
court
is
having
submitted
himself
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
limitation
court,
and
having
invoked
it,
he
is
now
--
asking
a
firm
to
relief
on
exoneration
liability
period,
asking
for
limited
liability,
and
counter
claiming,
he
has
thereby
fully
submitted
himself
to
the
court,
and
he
is
not
in
a
position
to
say,
just
because
of
the
forum
clause
don't
let
zapata
try
its
claim.
mr.
james
k.
nance
it's
meaningless.
your
honor
he
submitted
himself
or
he
hasn't,
i
want
to
call
attention
to
two
decisions
of
this
court
where
a
counter
claim
was
filed--
mr.
james
k.
nance
your
honor,
if
we
had
submitted
ourself
over
there,
if
we
had,
and
we
still
wouldn't,
we
have
a
right
to
sue
over
here,
we
certainly
have
a
right
to
sue
--
mr.
james
k.
nance
well
i
don't
believe
that
they
would
have
done
it,
your
honor
no
sir,
if
we
ruled
our
litigating,
that
case
is
not
even
at
issue.
that
there
is
nothing
been
done
about
the
case,
no
depositions
has
been
taken,
it
just
sitting
there.
mr.
james
k.
nance
but
they
could
have
filed
wherever
they
would
could
find
zapata
which
is
it's
used
to
and
that's
where
their
bases
--
mr.
james
k.
nance
what
who
should
have
done
mr.
justice?
mr.
james
k.
nance
if
you
would
repeat
it?
mr.
james
k.
nance
well
i'll
try
to
answer
this
way
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
of
course
this
was
stated,
they
had
the
privilege
they
wanted
to
assert
it
to
assert
their
--
the
liability
defenses
to
us
to
in
the
first
filed
suit
by
zapata.
now,
well,
before
we
filed
a
limitation
action
on
july
2,
this
case
has
been
pending
several
months.
as
i've
stated
our
litigating
by
taking
deposition
and
so
forth.
the
counsel
for
unterweser
had
all
the
opportunity
in
the
world
to
file
a
motion
with
the
district
court
and
acquiesce
him
--
your
honor
i
need
to
know
whether
you
are
going
to
overrule
my
motion
to
jurisdiction,
are
you
going
to
grant
them
because
i
got
to
make
a
decision
whether
or
not
i
need
to
file
my
limitation
of
liability
proceeding.
the
docket
entries
in
the
the
record
show
that
no
such
motion
were
made
and
i
am
certain
that
the
district
court,
like
any
other
judges
where
he's
advised
of
the
situation
would
such
a
motion
had
been
presented
you
would
have
ruled
on
these
things
in
order
to
accord
been
them
the
opportunity,
one
of
two
things,
they
could
plead
defensively
if
he
overruled
their
motion
of
jurisdiction,
or
as
they
have
the
privilege
to
do
and
they
were
under
no
legal
compulsion
to
do
they
could
have
filed
which
they
did
do
the
suit
which
is
before
this
court
today.
mr.
james
k.
nance
yes
sir.
mr.
james
k.
nance
no
sir,
the
record
shows
that
after
we
filed
our
lawsuit,
that
decision
had
been
taken,
they
filed
a
motion
to
address
the
court's
jurisdiction
saying
one;
that
it
lacked
jurisdiction
because
the
forum
clause.
well
that
was
overruled
probably
because
no
private
parties
cannot
fashion
their
own
private
rules
of
jurisdiction.
parties
by
contract
cannot
say
what
the
federal
court,
or
what
the
state
court's
jurisdiction
will
be,
either
it's
taken
jurisdiction
as
to
the
subject
matter,
that
was
presented
and
ultimately
it
was
overruled.
in
that
proceeding
they
filed
a
motion
to
stay,
and
to
decline
jurisdiction
on
the
ground
of
forum
non
convenience.
the
court
on
july
29th,
after
they
had
already
filed
a
limitation
action
on
july
2nd
overruled
those
motions.
so
those
motions
were
represented
to
the
court
and
you
overruled.
so
he
has
entered
two
orders
in
this
court
your
honor.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
an
order
overruling
the
motions
in
the
zapata's
first
filed
suit
addressed
to
the
jurisdiction.
and
he
is
overruled
a
motion
to
stay
which
is
what
is
before
this
court
today.
mr.
james
k.
nance
well,
it
certainly
was
a
---
it's
a
motion
that
he
couldn't
make
and
he
did
not
know
so
i
had
couldn't
project
what
you
do.
i
just
presume
that
the
court
would
move
on
with
such
motion
but
your
honor,
that
bags
the
issue
i
think
because
there
is
no
legal
compulsion
for
him
to
file
this
limitation
liability
proceeding.
he
did
it
for
two
reasons.
one
was
to
get
the
injunction
out
to
stop
the
litigation
in
the
first
filed
suit
of
zapata.
secondly,
if
he
claims
in
his
petition,
he
says,
i
fear
the
falling
of
other
suits.
however
there
were
seamen
on
our
rig
that
this
was
a
terrible
accident
and
they
were
flooded,
the
compartments,
they
were
sinking,
they
got
off,
they
came
back,
pumped
it
out
and
so
there
were
people
who
got
hurt.
he
shows
in
his
limitation
proceeding,
i
fear
the
filing
of
other
claims.
now,
one
of
the
purposes
of
limitation
proceeding
is
as
here
by
the
cases
are
cited
in
brief
is
to
provide
a
concourse
not
only
for
the
claim
for
he
has
sued
us
in
the
limitation
because
he
did,
he
got
off
the
monitions.
it
come
into
this
court
but
in
order
to
bring
in
to
concourse,
the
claimants
who
got
hurt
on
the
rig.
and
by
doing
that
he
has
only
one,
they
get
just
one
piece
of
pie
they
can
slice.
the
value
of
the
tug
which
is
$1,390,000
here.
and
that
is
--
this
is
most
important
your
honor
if
you
read
(inaudible)
that
says
the
purpose
of
limitation
proceeding
being
an
equitable
one
is
one
to
bring
all
controversies
into
one
so
that
the
court
can
administer
and
dispose
off
any
counter
controversy.
that
case
has
been
cited
in
the
british
transport
case
saying
where
they
said
a
limitation
proceeding
is
a
cost
liable,
against
the
claimant
and
so
your
honor
i
submit
that
he
has
invoked
it,
it's
here,
i'll
admit.
he
is
nothing
--
mr.
james
k.
nance
he
could
have
pleaded,
your
honor.
mr.
james
k.
nance
the
difference
your
honor
would
be
that
if
these
seamen,
american
seamen,
sued
him
for
jones
act
where
there
is
a
third
party
case,
of
course
if
he
hadn't
filed
within
six
months.
mr.
james
k.
nance
well,
under
the
case
your
honor
he
can
file
his
answer
under
the
case
i've
cited
in
the
brief,
he
can
file
those
at
any
time
before
they
go
to
trial.
i
can
hear
the
defense,
he
always
got
the
question
of
notice,
i
mean
--
mr.
james
k.
nance
no,
i
am
not
going
to
get
that
straight.
he
has
imperatives
addressed
this
equity
court
to
say
your
honor
in
whatever
state
it
is
send
zapata
away
there.
i
do
not
think
as
a
matter
of
his
way
he
did,
the
point
is
he
has
invoked
and
submitted
himself
to
this
equitable
court,
asking
for
exonerations
from
liabilites
not
only
to
us
but
to
the
world
and
also
saying
--
mr.
james
k.
nance
so
inconsistent
possession
to
say
that
i
here
invoke
the
court's
jurisdiction
and
now
we're
there
but
i
counterclaim
and
sue
and
your
honor
--
mr.
james
k.
nance
yes,
and
i'm
coming
to
discuss
[voice
overlap]
when
i
say
what
i
think
is
the
proper
interpretation
of
the
–
oh
is
my
light
off?
mr.
james
k.
nance
may
i
have
5
minutes,
your
honor?
mr.
james
k.
nance
i
don't
want
to
get
to
that
and
i
would
hope
you
would
give
me
five
minutes
your
honor.
this
is
a
–
we
have
been
litigating
this
case
for
four
years,
and
i'm
sorry,
i
mean
i
think
i
could
give
my
speech
in
30
minutes.
i
appreciate
and
the
court
should
ask
me
anything
it
wishes
and
i
want
to
answer
your
question
--
mr.
james
k.
nance
thank
you.
i
want
to
base
--
these
two
supreme
court
cases
are
not
in
my
brief
and
one
decided
by
mr.
justice
douglas,
freeman
v.
bee
machine
co.
in
1943,
that's
319
u.s.
448
where
this
court
held
that
a
defendant
found
a
counter
claim,
he
submitted
in
both
the
jurisdictions
of
the
court
and
submitted
himself
for
purposes
of
which
he
was
there.
mr.
james
k.
nance
that
was
not
a
forum
clause,
no
sir.
mr.
james
k.
nance
well,
yes
--
well,
it
does
in
this
sense
your
honor
because
we
are
not
taking
position
that
the
decision
that
the
forum
clause
has
been
--
he
is
already
entitled
to
assert
it,
but
the
limitation
core
sitting
in
(inaudible)
had
to
take
in
consideration
all
the
factors
which
are
fixed
and
discussed
on
the
reason
list
of
the
forum
clause
in
just
a
moment.
mr.
james
k.
nance
alright
sir,
the
other
case
relied
upon
in
that
case
was
merchants
heat
&
light
co.
v.
james
b.
clow
&
sons.,
204
u.s.
286
for
the
court
held
that
the
filing
of
a
counter
claim
thus
is
that
he
waived
all
objections
to
the
jurisdiction
if
it's
good
for
that,
it
certainly
won't
say
he
has
waived
his
right
to
assert
that
we
should
be
sent
somewhere,
but
the
rational
of
the
case
is
en
banc.
now,
i
want
to
address
myself
now
quickly.
the
forum
clause
reads,
any
dispute
arising
must
be
treated
before
the
london
court
of
justice.
a
forum
clause
was
strictly
construed
in
this
court
in
the
carbon
black
v.
monrosa
case
cited
in
the
brief.
here
that
clause
was
drafted
by
the
german
company
having
usually
but
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
provisions
in
it.
they
did
not
in
this
case
and
we
submit
in
the
guided
fully
brief
here
that,
that
forum
clause
being
non-exclusive
in
nature
should
not
be
a
bar
to
preclude
zapata
from
prosecuting
it's
counterclaim
in
this
suit.
i
think
the
court
has
called
upon
to
pass
upon
that.
now
turning
to
this
question,
the
waving
authority
in
this
country
is
that
forum
clauses
are
unenforceable.
all
cases
hold
that
there
are
avoided
against
by
the
(inaudible)
and
so
far
as
they
attempt
to
deprive
or
defeat
any
court
of
its
jurisdiction.
there
are
a
line
of
cases
referred
to
as
a
modern
rule
starting
in
the
second
circuit
william
h.
muller
and
other
citied
in
the
brief
here
which
say
that
under
appropriate
set
of
circumstances,
a
court
may
decline
to
assert
its
jurisdiction
in
a
case
where
there
is
a
forum
clause
involved.
and
they
look
at
these
factors
and
mr.
kerr
in
urging
this
on
the
court,
said
to
the
court
among
other
facts
that
you
can
consider,
is
whether
or
not
the
plaintiff,
we
were
plaintiff
there
at
that
stage,
would
be
deprived
of
this
remedy
if
you
were
relegated
to
the
forum
court.
in
the
second
circuit
after
this
reasonable
--
the
forum
clause
maybe
enforced
if
reasonable.
the
case
is
on
there
head
in
situation
cited
in
the
brief
that
where
the
plaintiff
would
be
deprived
of
his
remedy
in
the
jurisdictional
forum,
stipulated
forum,
that
in
that
instances
that
is
a
proper
consideration
and
that
they
could
keep
the
case.
now
the
reasonableness
of
this
thing
and
we
have
covered
this
clearly,
where
they
include
nationalities
of
the
the
parties,
place
to
form
the
contract,
deprivation
of
remedy
and
then
the
balance
of
convenience
of
the
trial.
and
i
am
hoping
to
clear
this
in
one
moment.
the
trial
court
found
that
the
balance
of
convenience
is
strong
in
his
forum,
all
the
evidence
of
the
zapata
liability,
and
damages
is
in
the
merits
about
forum
depositions
of
40
witness.
toed
because
of
tremendous
amount
of
repairs
and
liability.
all
the
evidence
is
to
the
german
unterweser
as
to
toe
line
approach
is
in
florida
where
there
is
survey.
the
salvage
suit
testimony
has
been
taken
but
a
deposition,
is
to
what
the
service
it
was
done.
that
preserved
the
depositions
of
florida.
the
only
thing
that
we
will
have
to
calculate
would
be
the
hire
of
the
tug
which
it
didn't
get
because
it
didn't
finish
the
voyage.
i
think
it's
most
important
that
this
court
in
deciding
the
case
that
i
do
believe
you
would
find
it,
the
worse
of
a
standpoint
that
the
forums
clause
is
not
enforceable,
ipso
facto,
no
case
holds
that.
they
all
say
you
must
--
the
court
must
look
at
all
the
circumstances
and
we
have
detailed
very
much
in
our
brief
all
of
those
sayings
and
there
is
a
fact
time
with
courts
that
the
balance
of
convenience
is
strongly
there.
this
is
an
equity
court,
he
exercised
his
best
judgment
where
he
should
do
on
the
circumstances
and
i
don't
think
that
the
unterwerser
has
shown
to
this
court
any
abuse
of
that
discretion,
i
thank
you.
