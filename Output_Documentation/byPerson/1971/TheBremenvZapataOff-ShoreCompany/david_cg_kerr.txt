mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
here
is
unterweser
reederei,
a
german
corporation,
domiciled
in
bremen,
germany,
the
owner
of
the
seagoing
tug
bremen.
the
respondent
is
zapata
off-shore
company,
a
multinational
drilling
company,
owner
of
the
drill
rig
self-elevated
drill
rig
chaparral.
very
briefly
the
facts
and
circumstances
which
bring
this
case
to
this
court,
have
their
genesis
in
a
drilling
contract,
executed
by
and
between
zapata
or
through
it's
wholly
owned
foreign
subsidiary
and
italian
company
by
the
name
of
(inaudible)
calling
for
presence
of
the
drill
rig
chaparral,
off
of
ravenna,
italy
at
the
adriatic.
this
necessitated
of
course,
towing
the
chaparral
from
it's
sites
off
of
louisiana
to
the
adriatic,
off
of
ravenna.
the
zapata
solicited
this
for
this
towage
voyage
and
several
companies
responded,
including
the
petition
here
unterweser.
unterweser
was
the
low
bidder
and
subsequently
was
requested
to
submit
a
contract
and
it
did
so,
submitted
a
contract
to
zapata
in
houston
and
several
changes
were
made
in
that
contract.
it
was
executed
by
zapata,
houston
and
the
contract
was
then
forwarded
to
bremen
where
the
changes
were
accepted
and
the
contract
was
executed.
the
tow
voyage
commenced
on
about
january
5,
1968
from
the
(inaudible)
mississippi
and
some
5
days
later
in
the
middle
of
the
gulf
of
mexico,
a
casualty
occurred
which
precipitated
a
number
of
losses,
very
briefly
the
nature
of
casualty
was
a
collapse
of
the
three
drilling
legs
and
a
parting
of
the
tow
line.
the
tow
was
reestablished
by
the
tug
bremen
and
on
orders
from
zapata,
it
proceeded
to
the
port
of
tampa,
florida
which
was
a
nearest
port
of
refuge.
on
arrival,
at
tampa,
the
tug
bremen
was
met
by
united
states
marshal
and
arrested
in
conjunction
or
in
connection
with
a
complaint
which
had
been
filed
by
zapata
the
previous
day,
alleging
negligent
towage
and
basically
a
complaint
in
admiralty
based
on
towage.
that
is
the
first
litigation
in
this
particular
matter
and
very
briefly,
the
complaint
was
filed.
in
that
litigation,
i
indicated
the
day
prior
to
the
arrival
of
the
flotilla
in
tampa
and
subsequently,
unterweser
filed
a
motion
in
the
district
court
at
tampa,
seeking
among
other
things
that
the
action
in
tampa
be
stayed,
pursuant
to
a
foreign
clause
in
a
towage
contract
which
provided
that
all
disputes
should
be
heard
by
the
london
court
of
justice
in
england.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
yes
sir.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
the
record
is
devoid
of
indication
that
was
discussion
between
the
parties.
the
only
thing
we
have
in
the
record,
mr.
justice
brennan,
is
the
fact
that
the
director
of
unterweser
said
that
without
that
clause,
they
would
not
have
entered
into
this
contract.
the
contract
was
submitted,
as
i
have
indicated,
by
the
unterweser
to
zapata
in
houston,
was
reviewed
presumably
by
zapata
in
houston.
they
made
several
changes
and
initialed
and
sent
back
to
bremen.
that
clause
was
not
changed
in
anyway.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
yes
sir,
it
was
in
the
original
submission
and
obviously
in
the
--
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
what
you're
referring
to
mr.
justice
brennan
is
the
fact
that
the
director
from
unterweser,
that's
the
affidavit
of
eric
oswegon
(ph),
in
which
he
said
that
normally
unterweser
applies
german
law
and
german
forums
to
their
contracts
but
here,
recognizing
that
this
tow
voyage
would
traverse
many
jurisdictions
and
as
a
compromise,
they
selected
the
london
forum
and
then
submitted
that
to
zapata
and
zapata
executed
the
contract.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
yes
sir.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
i
believe
that's
what
happened
here.
i
believe
this
was
a
neutral
forum
and
it
was
decided
upon
as
a
selection
of
a
forum
in
recognition
that
this
tow
voyage
was
after
all
going
to
traverse
many
jurisdictions
and
be
subject
to
many
nationality
or
the
courts
of
many
nationality.
zapata
filed
its
motion,
as
i've
indicated,
seeking
among
other
things
to
state.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
no
mr.
justice
white.
it
merely
said
that
all
disputes
shall
be
submitted
to
the
london
court
of
justice.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
no,
we
would
contend
that
the
attempt
was
to
specify
english
law
as
well
and
that's
how
the
clause
has
been
interrupted
by
the
english
courts
which
have
also
had
this
case
before.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
apparently,
the
english
law,
on
that
subject,
mr.
justice
white,
is
that
where
the
parties
had
selected
the
forum,
it
is
presumed
that
they
selected
it
with
the
intent
of
having
that
forum
apply
its
own
law.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
i
can't
answer
that
question
on
english
law.
as
far
as
i
know
in
this
case,
the
english
court
has
indicated
and
this
i
believe
was
in
the
judge
karminski's
decision
in
the
london
court
of
justice
that
presumably,
english
law
would
apply
but
whether
the
entire
body
or
the
english
law
including
conflicts
and
whether
you
get
into
a
(inaudible)
situation,
i
cannot
answer
that
question.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
that's
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
the
alternatives
would
be,
you
would
get
in
the
contact
theory,
as
determined
by
what
law
should
this
contract
be
construed
and
what
law
should
govern.
i
think
ultimately,
you
would
get
to
the
conclusion
that
the
contract
was
executed
in
bremen,
germany.
and
this
i
think
would
have
considerable
weight
as
i
understand
the
cases
that
have
dealt
with
contacts.
it's
true
you
have
an
american
national
but
that's
outweighed
by
german
national
and
german
flag
vessel.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
balanced.
so
ultimately
you
come
to
the
proposition
that
the
contract
was
executed
in
germany
ultimately.
following
the
filing
of
zapata's
motions
speaking,
to
have
this
matter
referred
to
london
court
of
justice,
the
matter
rested
in
the
district
court
for
some
months.
in
the
meantime,
the
tug
was
released
by
agreement
of
the
parties
and
unterweser
giving
security
in
the
amount
of
$3,500,000.
an
action
was
instituted
in
london
by
unterweser,
based
on
breach
of
the
towage
contract
and
zapata
appeared
in
that
action
and
objected
to
the
action
being
brought
in
london.
ultimately
the
london
high
court
of
justice
ruled
that
the
towage
contract
and
its
forum
provision,
particularly
the
forum
provision
was
reasonable
one
and
that
was
sustained
on
appeal
in
the
court
of
appeal
in
london.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
well,
believe
it
was
a
special
appearance.
they
raised
the
question
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
towage,
of
the
forum
provision
in
the
court,
saying
that
it
should
not
be
enforced
that
there
was
a
prior
action
pending
in
the
us
and
all
those
questions
were
decided
--
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
in
the
us
and
of
course
they
were
referring
to
their
district
court
action
in
tampa,
which
was
filed
in
january
and
the
action
by
unterweser
in
london
was
filed
in
february.
so
it
is
correct
that
that
action
was
pending
in
tampa
and
pending
on
zapata
on
unterweser's
motion
to
have
the
case
referred
to
london
and
in
accordance
with
the
towage
--.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
i
was
coming
to
that
mr.
justice
white,
that
comes
later.
at
this
point,
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
no
sir,
not
much
later,
about
six
months
later.
the
next
procedure
here
was
the
filing
by
unterweser
of
its
complaint
seeking
exoneration
and
limitation
of
liability.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
we
submit
that
it
had
to
do
that
in
order
to
protect
its
limitation
right
which
was
about
to
expire
--
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
if
the
forum
provision
had
been
enforced
by
the
district
court,
and
that
had
been
sustained
on
appeal
because
i
presume
an
appeal
would
have
been
taken,
then
they
would
not
have
to
file
a
limitation
action
in
us.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
because
at
the
time
that
we
filed
a
complaint
limitation,
the
district
court
had
still
not
on
ruled
on
our
original
motion
filed
in
the
original
action.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
because
the
six-month
statute
was
about
to
run,
and
if
you
do
not
file
a
limitation
within
six
months
of
first
written
notice,
you
may
lose
that
right.
so
if
we
hadn't
filed
--
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
you
may
lose
it
there
is
some
doubt,
mr.
justice
white.
the
respondents
have
argued
here,
that
we
could
have
filed
defensive
limitation.
this
has
two
problems
connected
with.
problem
number
one
is,
when
you
file
defensive
limitation
you
don't
protect
your
security,
because
there
may
be
multiple
claims
and
you
would
have
to
go
to
different
jurisdictions,
and
you
would
have
to
put
up
the
same
security
in
each
instances
were
a
lawsuit
was
filed.
so
one
of
the
purposes
would
be
defeated,
that
is
a
purpose
of
having
a
precocious
law
litigation.
the
second
danger,
or
problem
with
filing
limitation
by
answer
which
is
what
they
are
suggesting
is
essentially
that
there
is
some
question
of
the
law
and
this
court
has
never
decided,
whether
since
1937
amendment
to
the
limitation
act,
whether
or
not
defensive
limitation
can
be
filed
after
the
expiration
of
six
months,
and
the
text
writers
say
that
the
prudent
thing
to
do
is
to
file
a
petition
affordably
within
the
six
moth.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
mr.
justice
brennan,
this
is
precisely
what
we
did.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
in
the
petition
--
in
our
complaints
seeking
limitation,
we
reasserted
the
supremacy
of
the
forum
clause,
pointing
out
that
the
court
had
not
ruled
on,
that
we
were
compelled
to
file
limitation,
but
we
still
maintain
and
assert
it
that,
that
forum
clause
was
supreme
and
govern
the
cause
and
the
matter
should
be
referred
to
london.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
if
zapata
had
complied
with
this
contractual
obligations,
there
would
be
no
lawsuit
in
tampa.
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
they
do,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
but
it
is
somewhat
different.
it
is
different
in
amount
of
the
limitation
fund
as
the
respondent
points
out
that
it's
considerably
less
than
the
us.
and
then
also
they
have
no
statute
limitation
within
which
to
file.
they
don't
have
the
six
months.
in
england
you
can
only
file
your
limitation
action
once
a
claim
has
been
asserted
against
in
a
court.
there
is
no
limitation
period.
so
which
brings
up
another
point,
that
we
did
not
file
limitation
in
england,
because
it
would
have
been
premature
under
that
law.
because
we
had
no
claim
against
this,
the
london
action
is
not
an
issue.
zapata
never
responded
on
the
merits
because
the
london
action
was
stayed
by
the
united
states
district
court
in
tampa.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
they
would
have
a
filed
a
complaint,
alleging
in
the
british
courts,
alleging
negligent
towage
and
alleging,
i
presume
the
same
breaches
of
same
action
responsibility.
yes,
an
action
in
towage.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
under
british
law
as
we
understand
it
,
the
moment
you
have
a
court
of
circuit
claim
against
you.
you
may
then
turn
around
and
petition
for
limitation.
in
united
states,
you
could
petition
for
limitation
without
any
other
action
being
filed
just
within
the
six
months
of
written
notice
of
such
a
claim
that
might
be
asserted
against
you.
in
other
words,
there
is
no
statute
limitation
in
england.
what
triggers
the
limitation
under
british
law
is
the
filing
of
a
complaint
in
court
or
over
cross
claim
or
what
have
you.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
mr.
justice
white
there
are
clauses
in
the
contract
on
the
general
towage
conditions
which
are
incorporated
in
the
contract
by
reference,
which
have
been
categorized
by
british
solicitor,
say
affidavit
this
case
as
exculpatory
and
i
don't
think
we
would
serve
a
purpose
to
be
called
about
it,
i
think
they
are
exculpatory.
and
under
the
laws
of
great
britain
or
the
english
law,
prima
facie,
these
are
enforced
that
is
a
tugboat
is
permitted
to
entering
such
a
contract
with
its
tow.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
and
in
united
states,
this
is
of
course
a
critical
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
that's
bisso
and
dixilyn
and
other
decisions.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
we
say
this,
it's
premature
actually
to
determine
that
but
the
possibilities
or
the
likelihood
is
that
this
exculpatory
provision
or
these
clauses
which
in
that
read
altogether,
provide
an
exculpatory
provision,
would
be
enforced
by
the
british
courts,
of
course,
we
say
mr.
justice
white,
that
this
was
part
of
the
contract,
this
was
part
of
the
expectation
and
this
was
part
of
referring
a
case
to
london,
which
was
zapata's
contract
and
this
is
a
natural,
this
flows
naturally
from
the
entry
of
the
towage
contract.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
which
is
what
they
are
fighting
for.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
i
happen
to
know
that.
it's
not
in
the
record
but
they
are.
there
is
no
german
law
in
this
appendix,
although
we
did
plead
notice
of
foreign
law
including
german
law
because
when
we
filed
our
complaint
limitation,
we
were
in
doubt
as
to
ultimately
what
conflict
the
law
of
principle
might
be
applicable
so
in
order
to
be
completely
safely
we
plead,
british
law,
american
law,
and
german
law
in
the
alternative.
i
would
like
to
come
back
to
that
question
on
bisso
because
i
believe
that
the
file
analysis,
or
what
you
have
here
is
a
clash
of
policies
that
i
think
is
going
to
be
inherent
in
any
decision
this
court
might
make.
on
the
one
hand,
we
have
the
so
called
the
bisso,
dixilyn
policy
wherein
this
court
stated
that
it
was
a
public
policy,
as
a
public
policy
matter,
tugs
should
not
be
permitted
to
exempt
themselves
or
insulate
themselves
from
liability.
we
believe
that
in
this
particular
case,
there
are
overriding
policy
considerations
which
basically
are
making
parties
adhere
or
stick
to
their
contracts
particularly
in
an
international
context,
where
the
parties
has
selected
the
forum,
they've
done
so
for
a
variety
of
reasons
in
an
international
contract.
particularly,
for
certainty,
for
the
law
that
will
govern
their
contract
and
this
is
particularly
true,
we
submit
in
a
case,
where
the
performance
of
the
contract
will
traverse
as
was
the
case
in
this
instance
many,
many
jurisdictions
and
touched
on
many
different
--
the
waters
of
many
different
nations.
so,
we
feel
that
number
one
in
so
far
as
bisso
sought
to
enunciate
a
us
public
policy.
it
is
not
all
pervasive
because
in
bisso,
bisso
can
be
circumvented
by
routine
day-to-day
commercial
insurance
practice.
this
was
recognize
by
justice
frankfurt
in
his
original,
mr.
justice
frankfurt
in
original
dissent.
and
in
fact
and
indeed
is
circumvented
on
a
daily
basis
by
simply
having
the
tow
purchase
insurance
and
unterweser
way
of
subrogation
against
the
tug.
the
tug
is
completely
insulated
except
to
the
extend
of
a
small
deductible
perhaps.
so
and
in
other
fields
of
law,
this
court
and
other
courts
have
recognize
the
right
to
limit
one
liability
by
contract
or
even
to
exculpate
oneself.
so
we
don't
feel
that
bisso
was
in
all
pervasive
matter
of
public
policy,
but
more
importantly
in
the
context
of
this
case,
we
don't
feel
that
bisso
is
applicable
because
if
you
extend
bisso
to
cover
this
situation,
and
we
feel
it's
distinguished
well
on
its
facts
and
circumstance
but
if
this
court
should
extend
bisso
to
that
extent,
it
would
have
to
do
so
by
first
of
all
adopting
what
we
consider
is
a
modern
rule
on
forum
contract
provisions,
that
is
that
they
are
prima
facie
valid
unless
unreasonable.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
i
think
it's
improbable,
mr.
justice
brennan,
and
i
can't
give
you
a
positive
answer
obviously
but
i
think
it's
improbable
because
they
have
already
indicated
and
their
case
law
reflects,
that
in
a
situation
where
parties
select
the
forum,
they
also
intend
to
select
the
law,
otherwise
it
will
be
little
purposely
selecting
the
forum,
that
is
the
law
of
england.
so
they
probably
apply
english
law
and
insofar
if
someone
would
argue
that
they
had
to,
the
(inaudible)
situation
that
they
would
have
to
look
towards
american
law,
i
think
they
would
come
full
circle
and
say,
if
we
have
to
look
to
any
law
here,
it
would
probably
be
german
law
because
that's
what
the
contract
was
executed.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
yes
sir.
that
is
--
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
mr.
justice
brennan,
it
is
only
if
you
extend
bisso
rule
and
say
that
it
encompasses
this
situation
and
in
order
to
do
that,
you
must
say
that
it's
the
bisso
rule
which
makes
this
forum
clause
unreasonable
and
we
submit
that
you
get
into
a
situation
then
when
you
got
to
consider,
is
it
more
unreasonable
to
reform
this
contract
after
the
fact
in
favor
of
zapata
and
thereby
frustrate
even
zapata's
contractual
intent
what
ended
in
a
contract
and
at
the
same
time,
put
unterweser
in
an
economic,
position
of
economic
exposure
that
a
contract
to
insulate
itself
from,
is
that
one
unreasonable
or
is
it
more
reasonable
to
form
a
contract
and
enforce
bisso,
extend
bisso
to
cover
this
situation,
i
have
saved
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
yes,
sir.
well,
we
think
that's
true
because
why
would
a
party
designate
a
forum,
unless
they
turned
that
forum
replies
slow
and
further
more.
we
have
--
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
that
we
intended
british
law
to
apply.
zapata
for
it's
part
is
accustomed
to
this.
the
drilling
contract
which
is
in
the
appendix
that
is
a
contract
that's
it
wholly
owned
european
subsidiary
ended
into
the
italians
interestingly
enough,
provides
for
a
british
forum
and
the
applicability
of
british
common
law.
so,
we
feel
that
they
have
demonstrated
a
familiarity
with
that
procedure
and
that
indicates
that
they
do
this,
it's
a
matter
of
a
routine
there.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
mr.
chief
justice
if
it
please
the
court,
i
have
several
factual
points
i
think
should
be
cleared
up
that
were
raised
by
questions
from
the
court,
but
first
of
all
in
order
to
decide
what
the
lower
court,
the
district
court
determined
or
held
with
respect
to
our
motion,
our
original
motion
filed
in
the
initial
action
to
stay
this
proceeding
and
have
it
referred
to
london
court.
you
must
go
to
the
court's
original
order,
which
is
i
think
has
been
pointed
out
was
filed
as
submitted
or
entered
some
six
months
after
our
motions
was
originally
filed.
in
that
order
the
district
judge
committed
what
we
think
is
the
fundamental
error
in
this
case
with
respect
to
how
he
approached
the
case.
and
he
held
and
i
am
reading
from
page
82
of
the
appendix
which
is
judge
princeton's
order
of
july
29,
1968
and
i
am
reading
from
the
next
to
last
paragraph
on
that
page
and
the
last
sentence
of
that
paragraph.
we
think
this
is
crucial
to
show
the
misunderstanding
that
the
court
had
at
this
entire
issue.
the
balance
of
conveniences
here
is
not
strongly
in
favor
of
defendant
that
being
zapata
and
plaintiff's
choice
of
forum
should
not
be
disturbed.
this
means
that
as
of
that
date
with
the
initial
action
filed,
the
district
court
found
that
the
balance
of
convenience
was
in
unterweser's
favor,
although
not
strongly.
then
he
went
on
to
say
and
plaintiff's
choice
of
forum
should
not
be
disturbed
which
is
of
course
applying
the
forum
non-convenience
rule.
but,
the
difference
between
the
forum
non-convenience
rule
is
a
critical
difference,
and
the
difference
between
the
choice
of
forum
situation
is
that
the
initial
choice
of
forum
is
not
the
district
court
intent.
the
initial
choice
of
forum
here
is
london.
so
he
first
of
all
found
that
the
balances
of
conveniences
were
in
favor
of
unterweser
and
then
he
said,
he
applied
the
presumption
that
zapata's
choice
of
forum
was
tampa
which
of
course
it
was
not
by
contract
his
choice
of
forum
was
london
from
the
very
beginning.
i
make
that
point
because
i
think
it
is
critical
to
the
decision
of
this
case.
now,
there
were
several
factual
points
i
think
that
should
be
cleared
up
mr.
justice
white
you
ask
whether
--
you
asked
mr.
nance,
whether
or
not
insurance
was
mentioned
or
discussed.
mr.
nance
is
incorrect,
when
he
said
it
was
not.
insurance
was
mentioned,
in
the
original
telegraphic
bid
sent
by
unterweser
to
zapata
in
response
to
solicitation
for
bids
which
appears
on
page
295
of
the
appendix.
unterweser
agreed
or
offered
to
arrange
for
insurance
for
zapata
and
then
subsequently
in
the
towage
contract
that's
clause
2
b,
and
the
towage
contract
appears
in
several
points
in
this
appendix,
but
the
one
i
am
refereeing
to
is
on
the
page
72.
in
the
towage
contract,
it
was
stipulated
that
insurance
would
be
for
the
account
of
the
owner,
that
is
the
owner
of
the
towage,
zapata.
so
insurance
was
mentioned
and
the
decision
to
go
and
insure
was
here
decision
marrest
of
the
tugade
by
choice,
by
zapata.
so
i
don't
feel
that,
that
really
has
as
far
as
it's
saying
it
is
here
uninsured,
it
was
given
the
opportunity
to
get
insurance.
it
was
told
that
insurance
would
be
for
its
account.
so
insurance
was
discussed
by
the
party
and
mentioned
in
the
documents.
the
second
factual
point
is
with
respect
to
all
of
these
depositions.
it
is
true
that
a
lot
of
depositions
were
noticed
initially
when
the
tug
first
arrived
in
tampa
de
bene
esse,
we
move
for
protective
orders
twice.
in
the
second
protective
order
when
we
were
aware
of
all
of
the
facts
and
had
consulted
with
our
german
clients
we
specifically
pointed
out
that
this
clause
might
well
be
tried
in
london
and
therefore
some
of
the
discovery
that
taken
here
might
well
have
to
be
repeated,
but
the
court
orders
to
go
ahead
and
we
then
also
engage
in
discovery
depositions.
once
the
court
has
said
that
it
was
not
impressed
with
our
argument
and
in
any
event
we
feel
this
is
immaterial
because
we
have
stipulated
that
all
discovery
undertaken
in
united
states
will
be
admissible
in
the
london
action
subject
to
the
ordinary
rules
of
evidence.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
we
have
offered
this.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
yes
sir.
we
have
stipulated
unilaterally
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
the
london
proceeding
of
course
mr.
justice
brennan
is
stayed
by
injunction.
the
parties
have
been
enjoined
by
the
district
court
from
proceeding
which
raises
the
next
point
i
want
to
mention.
the
reason
that
all
the
issues
that
are
not
pending
in
london
is
not
because
they
could
not
be
presented
through
appropriate
pleading
in
london,
but
it
is
because
the
district
court
has
enjoined
us
as
parties
from
moving
forward
with
that
action.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
abandon
the
limitation
action
in
us,
i
suspect
we
will
mr.
justice
white
because
then
under
english
law
we
will
be
compelled
as
soon
as
zapata
makes
its
claims
against
us
in
the
english
action.
we
are
then
compelled
by
english
law
to
assert
english
limitation.
those
are
their
rules.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
so
far
as
i
know
your
honor
--
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
no
sir
and
of
course
those
claimants
would
not
be
bound,
be
bound
by
the
forum
provision
either.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
that's
right.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
yes
sir.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
that
is
correct.
that's
my
understanding
of
the
law
--
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
if
we
win
this
lawsuit,
we
would
ask
as
we
did,
we
have
already
asked
in
the
limitation
action
that
our
action
be
stayed
in
the
united
states
--
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
no
sir
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
we
have
one
of
the
concerns
here
and
concerns
in
some
of
the
cases
is
what
about
the
zapata's
security
after
all
they
brought
in
rem
suit.
the
purpose
for
bringing
in
rem
suit
is
to
obtain
security
and
we
did
post
security
and
we
post
a
bond
to
limitation
action,
and
one
of
the
reasons
that
action
in
tampa
would
remain
on
file
is
because
we
have
offer
to
make
that
security
available
to
zapata,
not
remove
it.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
that
is
correct,
that's
the
purpose
of
the
limitation
action.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
i
say
that
the
claimant
that
is
subject
to
a
forum
provision
must
litigate
where
the
contract
calls
for.
obviously,
we
can't
bargain
people
that
weren't
parties
to
the
contract.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
we
got
a
restraining
order
of
the
initial
suit.
this
is
the
traditional
form
that
--
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
and
they
did,
yes
sir.
and
they
filed
their
claim
in
that
and
that
action
of
course
has
all
the
issues
pending
in
it
that
pended
in
the
original
action.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
i
think
at
this
point
that's
a
safe
assumption
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
it
was
not
necessarily
a
safe
assumption
at
the
time,
that
this
action
was
originally
filed.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
mr.
chief
justice,
evidently
there
would
be
a
slight
distinction
as
a
matter
of
law
because
it
appears
that
arbitration
clauses
now
are
generally
recognized
and
enforced.
we
submit
and
we
have
argued
in
our
briefs
that
there
is
no
logical
reason
for
making
a
distinction
between
an
arbitration
clause
calling
for
arbitration
in
london
or
any
other
forum
and
a
contractual
forum
provision
and
that's
been
fully
argued
i
believe
by
both
parties.
but
there
would
be
that
slight
distinction
in
law
because
i
think
generally
arbitration
clauses
are
enforced
without
any
exceptions
now-a-days.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
i
wasn't
referring
to
the
recognition
as
far
as
the
results
or
what
the
review
might
be.
i
was
referring
to
the
fact
that
arbitration
clause
is
calling
for
arbitration
in
a
foreign
forum
are
generally
recognized
in
force
to
that
extent.
one
important
factor
that
we
also
want
to
make
very
clear
is
with
respect
to
the
limitation
action,
we
were
faced
of
course
with
the
moment,
an
action
is
filed
inevitably,
a
claim
in
this
country.
limitation,
a
petition
for
limitation
or
as
the
party
defendant
seeking
limitation,
this
is
almost
an
inevitable
consequence
of
that
action.
so
that
we
had
to
protect
our
security
in
this
country.
we
had
$3.5
million
security.
so
what
we
did
was
a
reactional
protective
measure,
avail
ourselves
of
a
protective
device
at
a
time
when
the
court
had
not
yet
approved
on
our
original
motion,
and
therefore
we
reasserted
in
that
petition
as
i
have
indicated
before
and
this
is
in
the
appendix,
we
reasserted
the
paramountacy
of
our
forum
provision
and
the
stay,
the
motion
for
stay.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
we
suggest
mr.
justice
brennan
no
for
two
reasons;
number
one,
we
would
not
have
had
a
protection
of
our
security.
we
might
then
be
called
upon
to
post
security
if
any
other
actions
were
filed
and
secondly
and
perhaps
more
importantly,
there
is
balance
in
the
law
at
the
present
time
that
we
cited
the
cases
and
the
comment
by
gilmore
and
blacks
on
that
point,
there
is
doubt
at
the
present
time
whether
defensive
limitation
is
permissible
after
six
months
have
expired
and
that
comes
about
as
the
moral
castle
amendment,
1937
when
the
six
months
provision
was
first
introduced
in
the
law
and
it's
not
entirely
clear
at
this
point
in
decisions
since
then
whether
you
can
file
defensive
limitation
after
the
expiration
of
six
months
and
in
any
event,
what
zapata
argues
is
that
in
the
limitation
proceeding,
we
are
invoking
the
benefits
of
the
limitation
act,
the
privilege
as
they
put
it.
well,
you
invoke
that
by
answer
or
by
petition,
so
you
are
subject
to
the
same
objection.
there
has
been
an
urging
here
with
respect
to
carbon
black
and
that
our
forum
provision
in
this
case
is
governed
by
carbon
black.
there
are
several
distinctions,
they
are
made
in
the
brief
but
the
principle
ones
are
in
carbon
black,
the
forum
clause
related
only
to
actions
against
the
master,
owner
or
agent,
that
is
it
was
person
stipulated
who
could
not
be
sued
and
fifth
circuit
ceased
upon
that
to
say
that
this
was
directed
in
personam
suits
and
not
in
rem
suits.
so
that's
one
distinction.
the
second
distinction
is
that
carbon
black
is
a
carriage
of
(inaudible)
case
and
therefore
governed
by
the
provisions
of
that
federal
statute
and
that
does
make
a
difference
and
that
difference
i
think
is
officially
discussed
in
briefs.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
yes
sir.
i
think
the
forum
clause
compelled
us
to
go
to
london
for
all
remedies
available
in
london
including
limitation
and
not
in
the
us.
in
so
far
as
zapata
is
concerned,
mr.
justice
white,
now
if
there
was
a
suit
by
a
third
person
not
subject
to
the
provisions
of
the
towage
contract,
obviously
we
could
file
limitation
--
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
yes
sir
and
i
think
the
limitations
court
would
say
that
since
zapata
is
compelled
by
contract
to
file
its
claim
in
london,
they
may
file
a
claim
in
london.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
they
can
or
should.
just
like
unterweser
would
have
to
file
its
limitation
claim
in
so
far
as
zapata
is
concerned
in
london
because
the
contract
is
binding
only
on
those
two
not
on
the
seamen
that
travel
on
the
chaparral.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
no
sir,
because
it
would
have
been
a
limitation
action
pending
in
london
presumably.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
no,
obviously
zapata
hadn't
sued
us
there,
there
would
be
no
limitation
action
in
london
but
if
the
contract
had
been
complied
with,
all
of
the
issues
in
this
clause,
including
limitation
would
have
been
before
the
london
high
court
of
justice.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
i
think
absolutely,
successfully.
i
think
we
could
have
--
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
yes
sir,
because
we
would
not
have
filed
the
limitation
--
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
well
i
feel
i
do
because
the
action
would,
there
would
have
been
a
limitation
action
pending
in
london
presumably.
this
could
only
have
happened
if
zapata
had
gone
to
london
and
they
would
have
been
engaged
in
all
the
issues
that
would
have
been
in
london.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
this
is
just
a
difference
in
the
limitation
funds
in
the
two
countries.
the
limitation
fund
in
great
britain
is
smaller
than
the
limitation
fund
in
the
us.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
yes
sir,
$80,000,
yes
sir.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
it's
$1,
390,000
which
is
presently
the
established
value
of
the
bremen
at
the
present
juncture
of
the
proceedings.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
here
is
unterweser
reederei,
a
german
corporation,
domiciled
in
bremen,
germany,
the
owner
of
the
seagoing
tug
bremen.
the
respondent
is
zapata
off-shore
company,
a
multinational
drilling
company,
owner
of
the
drill
rig
self-elevated
drill
rig
chaparral.
very
briefly
the
facts
and
circumstances
which
bring
this
case
to
this
court,
have
their
genesis
in
a
drilling
contract,
executed
by
and
between
zapata
or
through
it's
wholly
owned
foreign
subsidiary
and
italian
company
by
the
name
of
(inaudible)
calling
for
presence
of
the
drill
rig
chaparral,
off
of
ravenna,
italy
at
the
adriatic.
this
necessitated
of
course,
towing
the
chaparral
from
it's
sites
off
of
louisiana
to
the
adriatic,
off
of
ravenna.
the
zapata
solicited
this
for
this
towage
voyage
and
several
companies
responded,
including
the
petition
here
unterweser.
unterweser
was
the
low
bidder
and
subsequently
was
requested
to
submit
a
contract
and
it
did
so,
submitted
a
contract
to
zapata
in
houston
and
several
changes
were
made
in
that
contract.
it
was
executed
by
zapata,
houston
and
the
contract
was
then
forwarded
to
bremen
where
the
changes
were
accepted
and
the
contract
was
executed.
the
tow
voyage
commenced
on
about
january
5,
1968
from
the
(inaudible)
mississippi
and
some
5
days
later
in
the
middle
of
the
gulf
of
mexico,
a
casualty
occurred
which
precipitated
a
number
of
losses,
very
briefly
the
nature
of
casualty
was
a
collapse
of
the
three
drilling
legs
and
a
parting
of
the
tow
line.
the
tow
was
reestablished
by
the
tug
bremen
and
on
orders
from
zapata,
it
proceeded
to
the
port
of
tampa,
florida
which
was
a
nearest
port
of
refuge.
on
arrival,
at
tampa,
the
tug
bremen
was
met
by
united
states
marshal
and
arrested
in
conjunction
or
in
connection
with
a
complaint
which
had
been
filed
by
zapata
the
previous
day,
alleging
negligent
towage
and
basically
a
complaint
in
admiralty
based
on
towage.
that
is
the
first
litigation
in
this
particular
matter
and
very
briefly,
the
complaint
was
filed.
in
that
litigation,
i
indicated
the
day
prior
to
the
arrival
of
the
flotilla
in
tampa
and
subsequently,
unterweser
filed
a
motion
in
the
district
court
at
tampa,
seeking
among
other
things
that
the
action
in
tampa
be
stayed,
pursuant
to
a
foreign
clause
in
a
towage
contract
which
provided
that
all
disputes
should
be
heard
by
the
london
court
of
justice
in
england.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
yes
sir.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
the
record
is
devoid
of
indication
that
was
discussion
between
the
parties.
the
only
thing
we
have
in
the
record,
mr.
justice
brennan,
is
the
fact
that
the
director
of
unterweser
said
that
without
that
clause,
they
would
not
have
entered
into
this
contract.
the
contract
was
submitted,
as
i
have
indicated,
by
the
unterweser
to
zapata
in
houston,
was
reviewed
presumably
by
zapata
in
houston.
they
made
several
changes
and
initialed
and
sent
back
to
bremen.
that
clause
was
not
changed
in
anyway.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
yes
sir,
it
was
in
the
original
submission
and
obviously
in
the
--
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
what
you're
referring
to
mr.
justice
brennan
is
the
fact
that
the
director
from
unterweser,
that's
the
affidavit
of
eric
oswegon
(ph),
in
which
he
said
that
normally
unterweser
applies
german
law
and
german
forums
to
their
contracts
but
here,
recognizing
that
this
tow
voyage
would
traverse
many
jurisdictions
and
as
a
compromise,
they
selected
the
london
forum
and
then
submitted
that
to
zapata
and
zapata
executed
the
contract.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
yes
sir.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
i
believe
that's
what
happened
here.
i
believe
this
was
a
neutral
forum
and
it
was
decided
upon
as
a
selection
of
a
forum
in
recognition
that
this
tow
voyage
was
after
all
going
to
traverse
many
jurisdictions
and
be
subject
to
many
nationality
or
the
courts
of
many
nationality.
zapata
filed
its
motion,
as
i've
indicated,
seeking
among
other
things
to
state.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
no
mr.
justice
white.
it
merely
said
that
all
disputes
shall
be
submitted
to
the
london
court
of
justice.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
no,
we
would
contend
that
the
attempt
was
to
specify
english
law
as
well
and
that's
how
the
clause
has
been
interrupted
by
the
english
courts
which
have
also
had
this
case
before.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
apparently,
the
english
law,
on
that
subject,
mr.
justice
white,
is
that
where
the
parties
had
selected
the
forum,
it
is
presumed
that
they
selected
it
with
the
intent
of
having
that
forum
apply
its
own
law.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
i
can't
answer
that
question
on
english
law.
as
far
as
i
know
in
this
case,
the
english
court
has
indicated
and
this
i
believe
was
in
the
judge
karminski's
decision
in
the
london
court
of
justice
that
presumably,
english
law
would
apply
but
whether
the
entire
body
or
the
english
law
including
conflicts
and
whether
you
get
into
a
(inaudible)
situation,
i
cannot
answer
that
question.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
that's
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
the
alternatives
would
be,
you
would
get
in
the
contact
theory,
as
determined
by
what
law
should
this
contract
be
construed
and
what
law
should
govern.
i
think
ultimately,
you
would
get
to
the
conclusion
that
the
contract
was
executed
in
bremen,
germany.
and
this
i
think
would
have
considerable
weight
as
i
understand
the
cases
that
have
dealt
with
contacts.
it's
true
you
have
an
american
national
but
that's
outweighed
by
german
national
and
german
flag
vessel.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
balanced.
so
ultimately
you
come
to
the
proposition
that
the
contract
was
executed
in
germany
ultimately.
following
the
filing
of
zapata's
motions
speaking,
to
have
this
matter
referred
to
london
court
of
justice,
the
matter
rested
in
the
district
court
for
some
months.
in
the
meantime,
the
tug
was
released
by
agreement
of
the
parties
and
unterweser
giving
security
in
the
amount
of
$3,500,000.
an
action
was
instituted
in
london
by
unterweser,
based
on
breach
of
the
towage
contract
and
zapata
appeared
in
that
action
and
objected
to
the
action
being
brought
in
london.
ultimately
the
london
high
court
of
justice
ruled
that
the
towage
contract
and
its
forum
provision,
particularly
the
forum
provision
was
reasonable
one
and
that
was
sustained
on
appeal
in
the
court
of
appeal
in
london.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
well,
believe
it
was
a
special
appearance.
they
raised
the
question
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
towage,
of
the
forum
provision
in
the
court,
saying
that
it
should
not
be
enforced
that
there
was
a
prior
action
pending
in
the
us
and
all
those
questions
were
decided
--
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
in
the
us
and
of
course
they
were
referring
to
their
district
court
action
in
tampa,
which
was
filed
in
january
and
the
action
by
unterweser
in
london
was
filed
in
february.
so
it
is
correct
that
that
action
was
pending
in
tampa
and
pending
on
zapata
on
unterweser's
motion
to
have
the
case
referred
to
london
and
in
accordance
with
the
towage
--.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
i
was
coming
to
that
mr.
justice
white,
that
comes
later.
at
this
point,
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
no
sir,
not
much
later,
about
six
months
later.
the
next
procedure
here
was
the
filing
by
unterweser
of
its
complaint
seeking
exoneration
and
limitation
of
liability.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
we
submit
that
it
had
to
do
that
in
order
to
protect
its
limitation
right
which
was
about
to
expire
--
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
if
the
forum
provision
had
been
enforced
by
the
district
court,
and
that
had
been
sustained
on
appeal
because
i
presume
an
appeal
would
have
been
taken,
then
they
would
not
have
to
file
a
limitation
action
in
us.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
because
at
the
time
that
we
filed
a
complaint
limitation,
the
district
court
had
still
not
on
ruled
on
our
original
motion
filed
in
the
original
action.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
because
the
six-month
statute
was
about
to
run,
and
if
you
do
not
file
a
limitation
within
six
months
of
first
written
notice,
you
may
lose
that
right.
so
if
we
hadn't
filed
--
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
you
may
lose
it
there
is
some
doubt,
mr.
justice
white.
the
respondents
have
argued
here,
that
we
could
have
filed
defensive
limitation.
this
has
two
problems
connected
with.
problem
number
one
is,
when
you
file
defensive
limitation
you
don't
protect
your
security,
because
there
may
be
multiple
claims
and
you
would
have
to
go
to
different
jurisdictions,
and
you
would
have
to
put
up
the
same
security
in
each
instances
were
a
lawsuit
was
filed.
so
one
of
the
purposes
would
be
defeated,
that
is
a
purpose
of
having
a
precocious
law
litigation.
the
second
danger,
or
problem
with
filing
limitation
by
answer
which
is
what
they
are
suggesting
is
essentially
that
there
is
some
question
of
the
law
and
this
court
has
never
decided,
whether
since
1937
amendment
to
the
limitation
act,
whether
or
not
defensive
limitation
can
be
filed
after
the
expiration
of
six
months,
and
the
text
writers
say
that
the
prudent
thing
to
do
is
to
file
a
petition
affordably
within
the
six
moth.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
mr.
justice
brennan,
this
is
precisely
what
we
did.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
in
the
petition
--
in
our
complaints
seeking
limitation,
we
reasserted
the
supremacy
of
the
forum
clause,
pointing
out
that
the
court
had
not
ruled
on,
that
we
were
compelled
to
file
limitation,
but
we
still
maintain
and
assert
it
that,
that
forum
clause
was
supreme
and
govern
the
cause
and
the
matter
should
be
referred
to
london.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
if
zapata
had
complied
with
this
contractual
obligations,
there
would
be
no
lawsuit
in
tampa.
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
they
do,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
but
it
is
somewhat
different.
it
is
different
in
amount
of
the
limitation
fund
as
the
respondent
points
out
that
it's
considerably
less
than
the
us.
and
then
also
they
have
no
statute
limitation
within
which
to
file.
they
don't
have
the
six
months.
in
england
you
can
only
file
your
limitation
action
once
a
claim
has
been
asserted
against
in
a
court.
there
is
no
limitation
period.
so
which
brings
up
another
point,
that
we
did
not
file
limitation
in
england,
because
it
would
have
been
premature
under
that
law.
because
we
had
no
claim
against
this,
the
london
action
is
not
an
issue.
zapata
never
responded
on
the
merits
because
the
london
action
was
stayed
by
the
united
states
district
court
in
tampa.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
they
would
have
a
filed
a
complaint,
alleging
in
the
british
courts,
alleging
negligent
towage
and
alleging,
i
presume
the
same
breaches
of
same
action
responsibility.
yes,
an
action
in
towage.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
under
british
law
as
we
understand
it
,
the
moment
you
have
a
court
of
circuit
claim
against
you.
you
may
then
turn
around
and
petition
for
limitation.
in
united
states,
you
could
petition
for
limitation
without
any
other
action
being
filed
just
within
the
six
months
of
written
notice
of
such
a
claim
that
might
be
asserted
against
you.
in
other
words,
there
is
no
statute
limitation
in
england.
what
triggers
the
limitation
under
british
law
is
the
filing
of
a
complaint
in
court
or
over
cross
claim
or
what
have
you.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
mr.
justice
white
there
are
clauses
in
the
contract
on
the
general
towage
conditions
which
are
incorporated
in
the
contract
by
reference,
which
have
been
categorized
by
british
solicitor,
say
affidavit
this
case
as
exculpatory
and
i
don't
think
we
would
serve
a
purpose
to
be
called
about
it,
i
think
they
are
exculpatory.
and
under
the
laws
of
great
britain
or
the
english
law,
prima
facie,
these
are
enforced
that
is
a
tugboat
is
permitted
to
entering
such
a
contract
with
its
tow.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
and
in
united
states,
this
is
of
course
a
critical
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
that's
bisso
and
dixilyn
and
other
decisions.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
we
say
this,
it's
premature
actually
to
determine
that
but
the
possibilities
or
the
likelihood
is
that
this
exculpatory
provision
or
these
clauses
which
in
that
read
altogether,
provide
an
exculpatory
provision,
would
be
enforced
by
the
british
courts,
of
course,
we
say
mr.
justice
white,
that
this
was
part
of
the
contract,
this
was
part
of
the
expectation
and
this
was
part
of
referring
a
case
to
london,
which
was
zapata's
contract
and
this
is
a
natural,
this
flows
naturally
from
the
entry
of
the
towage
contract.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
which
is
what
they
are
fighting
for.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
i
happen
to
know
that.
it's
not
in
the
record
but
they
are.
there
is
no
german
law
in
this
appendix,
although
we
did
plead
notice
of
foreign
law
including
german
law
because
when
we
filed
our
complaint
limitation,
we
were
in
doubt
as
to
ultimately
what
conflict
the
law
of
principle
might
be
applicable
so
in
order
to
be
completely
safely
we
plead,
british
law,
american
law,
and
german
law
in
the
alternative.
i
would
like
to
come
back
to
that
question
on
bisso
because
i
believe
that
the
file
analysis,
or
what
you
have
here
is
a
clash
of
policies
that
i
think
is
going
to
be
inherent
in
any
decision
this
court
might
make.
on
the
one
hand,
we
have
the
so
called
the
bisso,
dixilyn
policy
wherein
this
court
stated
that
it
was
a
public
policy,
as
a
public
policy
matter,
tugs
should
not
be
permitted
to
exempt
themselves
or
insulate
themselves
from
liability.
we
believe
that
in
this
particular
case,
there
are
overriding
policy
considerations
which
basically
are
making
parties
adhere
or
stick
to
their
contracts
particularly
in
an
international
context,
where
the
parties
has
selected
the
forum,
they've
done
so
for
a
variety
of
reasons
in
an
international
contract.
particularly,
for
certainty,
for
the
law
that
will
govern
their
contract
and
this
is
particularly
true,
we
submit
in
a
case,
where
the
performance
of
the
contract
will
traverse
as
was
the
case
in
this
instance
many,
many
jurisdictions
and
touched
on
many
different
--
the
waters
of
many
different
nations.
so,
we
feel
that
number
one
in
so
far
as
bisso
sought
to
enunciate
a
us
public
policy.
it
is
not
all
pervasive
because
in
bisso,
bisso
can
be
circumvented
by
routine
day-to-day
commercial
insurance
practice.
this
was
recognize
by
justice
frankfurt
in
his
original,
mr.
justice
frankfurt
in
original
dissent.
and
in
fact
and
indeed
is
circumvented
on
a
daily
basis
by
simply
having
the
tow
purchase
insurance
and
unterweser
way
of
subrogation
against
the
tug.
the
tug
is
completely
insulated
except
to
the
extend
of
a
small
deductible
perhaps.
so
and
in
other
fields
of
law,
this
court
and
other
courts
have
recognize
the
right
to
limit
one
liability
by
contract
or
even
to
exculpate
oneself.
so
we
don't
feel
that
bisso
was
in
all
pervasive
matter
of
public
policy,
but
more
importantly
in
the
context
of
this
case,
we
don't
feel
that
bisso
is
applicable
because
if
you
extend
bisso
to
cover
this
situation,
and
we
feel
it's
distinguished
well
on
its
facts
and
circumstance
but
if
this
court
should
extend
bisso
to
that
extent,
it
would
have
to
do
so
by
first
of
all
adopting
what
we
consider
is
a
modern
rule
on
forum
contract
provisions,
that
is
that
they
are
prima
facie
valid
unless
unreasonable.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
i
think
it's
improbable,
mr.
justice
brennan,
and
i
can't
give
you
a
positive
answer
obviously
but
i
think
it's
improbable
because
they
have
already
indicated
and
their
case
law
reflects,
that
in
a
situation
where
parties
select
the
forum,
they
also
intend
to
select
the
law,
otherwise
it
will
be
little
purposely
selecting
the
forum,
that
is
the
law
of
england.
so
they
probably
apply
english
law
and
insofar
if
someone
would
argue
that
they
had
to,
the
(inaudible)
situation
that
they
would
have
to
look
towards
american
law,
i
think
they
would
come
full
circle
and
say,
if
we
have
to
look
to
any
law
here,
it
would
probably
be
german
law
because
that's
what
the
contract
was
executed.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
yes
sir.
that
is
--
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
mr.
justice
brennan,
it
is
only
if
you
extend
bisso
rule
and
say
that
it
encompasses
this
situation
and
in
order
to
do
that,
you
must
say
that
it's
the
bisso
rule
which
makes
this
forum
clause
unreasonable
and
we
submit
that
you
get
into
a
situation
then
when
you
got
to
consider,
is
it
more
unreasonable
to
reform
this
contract
after
the
fact
in
favor
of
zapata
and
thereby
frustrate
even
zapata's
contractual
intent
what
ended
in
a
contract
and
at
the
same
time,
put
unterweser
in
an
economic,
position
of
economic
exposure
that
a
contract
to
insulate
itself
from,
is
that
one
unreasonable
or
is
it
more
reasonable
to
form
a
contract
and
enforce
bisso,
extend
bisso
to
cover
this
situation,
i
have
saved
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
yes,
sir.
well,
we
think
that's
true
because
why
would
a
party
designate
a
forum,
unless
they
turned
that
forum
replies
slow
and
further
more.
we
have
--
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
that
we
intended
british
law
to
apply.
zapata
for
it's
part
is
accustomed
to
this.
the
drilling
contract
which
is
in
the
appendix
that
is
a
contract
that's
it
wholly
owned
european
subsidiary
ended
into
the
italians
interestingly
enough,
provides
for
a
british
forum
and
the
applicability
of
british
common
law.
so,
we
feel
that
they
have
demonstrated
a
familiarity
with
that
procedure
and
that
indicates
that
they
do
this,
it's
a
matter
of
a
routine
there.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
mr.
chief
justice
if
it
please
the
court,
i
have
several
factual
points
i
think
should
be
cleared
up
that
were
raised
by
questions
from
the
court,
but
first
of
all
in
order
to
decide
what
the
lower
court,
the
district
court
determined
or
held
with
respect
to
our
motion,
our
original
motion
filed
in
the
initial
action
to
stay
this
proceeding
and
have
it
referred
to
london
court.
you
must
go
to
the
court's
original
order,
which
is
i
think
has
been
pointed
out
was
filed
as
submitted
or
entered
some
six
months
after
our
motions
was
originally
filed.
in
that
order
the
district
judge
committed
what
we
think
is
the
fundamental
error
in
this
case
with
respect
to
how
he
approached
the
case.
and
he
held
and
i
am
reading
from
page
82
of
the
appendix
which
is
judge
princeton's
order
of
july
29,
1968
and
i
am
reading
from
the
next
to
last
paragraph
on
that
page
and
the
last
sentence
of
that
paragraph.
we
think
this
is
crucial
to
show
the
misunderstanding
that
the
court
had
at
this
entire
issue.
the
balance
of
conveniences
here
is
not
strongly
in
favor
of
defendant
that
being
zapata
and
plaintiff's
choice
of
forum
should
not
be
disturbed.
this
means
that
as
of
that
date
with
the
initial
action
filed,
the
district
court
found
that
the
balance
of
convenience
was
in
unterweser's
favor,
although
not
strongly.
then
he
went
on
to
say
and
plaintiff's
choice
of
forum
should
not
be
disturbed
which
is
of
course
applying
the
forum
non-convenience
rule.
but,
the
difference
between
the
forum
non-convenience
rule
is
a
critical
difference,
and
the
difference
between
the
choice
of
forum
situation
is
that
the
initial
choice
of
forum
is
not
the
district
court
intent.
the
initial
choice
of
forum
here
is
london.
so
he
first
of
all
found
that
the
balances
of
conveniences
were
in
favor
of
unterweser
and
then
he
said,
he
applied
the
presumption
that
zapata's
choice
of
forum
was
tampa
which
of
course
it
was
not
by
contract
his
choice
of
forum
was
london
from
the
very
beginning.
i
make
that
point
because
i
think
it
is
critical
to
the
decision
of
this
case.
now,
there
were
several
factual
points
i
think
that
should
be
cleared
up
mr.
justice
white
you
ask
whether
--
you
asked
mr.
nance,
whether
or
not
insurance
was
mentioned
or
discussed.
mr.
nance
is
incorrect,
when
he
said
it
was
not.
insurance
was
mentioned,
in
the
original
telegraphic
bid
sent
by
unterweser
to
zapata
in
response
to
solicitation
for
bids
which
appears
on
page
295
of
the
appendix.
unterweser
agreed
or
offered
to
arrange
for
insurance
for
zapata
and
then
subsequently
in
the
towage
contract
that's
clause
2
b,
and
the
towage
contract
appears
in
several
points
in
this
appendix,
but
the
one
i
am
refereeing
to
is
on
the
page
72.
in
the
towage
contract,
it
was
stipulated
that
insurance
would
be
for
the
account
of
the
owner,
that
is
the
owner
of
the
towage,
zapata.
so
insurance
was
mentioned
and
the
decision
to
go
and
insure
was
here
decision
marrest
of
the
tugade
by
choice,
by
zapata.
so
i
don't
feel
that,
that
really
has
as
far
as
it's
saying
it
is
here
uninsured,
it
was
given
the
opportunity
to
get
insurance.
it
was
told
that
insurance
would
be
for
its
account.
so
insurance
was
discussed
by
the
party
and
mentioned
in
the
documents.
the
second
factual
point
is
with
respect
to
all
of
these
depositions.
it
is
true
that
a
lot
of
depositions
were
noticed
initially
when
the
tug
first
arrived
in
tampa
de
bene
esse,
we
move
for
protective
orders
twice.
in
the
second
protective
order
when
we
were
aware
of
all
of
the
facts
and
had
consulted
with
our
german
clients
we
specifically
pointed
out
that
this
clause
might
well
be
tried
in
london
and
therefore
some
of
the
discovery
that
taken
here
might
well
have
to
be
repeated,
but
the
court
orders
to
go
ahead
and
we
then
also
engage
in
discovery
depositions.
once
the
court
has
said
that
it
was
not
impressed
with
our
argument
and
in
any
event
we
feel
this
is
immaterial
because
we
have
stipulated
that
all
discovery
undertaken
in
united
states
will
be
admissible
in
the
london
action
subject
to
the
ordinary
rules
of
evidence.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
we
have
offered
this.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
yes
sir.
we
have
stipulated
unilaterally
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
the
london
proceeding
of
course
mr.
justice
brennan
is
stayed
by
injunction.
the
parties
have
been
enjoined
by
the
district
court
from
proceeding
which
raises
the
next
point
i
want
to
mention.
the
reason
that
all
the
issues
that
are
not
pending
in
london
is
not
because
they
could
not
be
presented
through
appropriate
pleading
in
london,
but
it
is
because
the
district
court
has
enjoined
us
as
parties
from
moving
forward
with
that
action.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
abandon
the
limitation
action
in
us,
i
suspect
we
will
mr.
justice
white
because
then
under
english
law
we
will
be
compelled
as
soon
as
zapata
makes
its
claims
against
us
in
the
english
action.
we
are
then
compelled
by
english
law
to
assert
english
limitation.
those
are
their
rules.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
so
far
as
i
know
your
honor
--
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
no
sir
and
of
course
those
claimants
would
not
be
bound,
be
bound
by
the
forum
provision
either.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
that's
right.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
yes
sir.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
that
is
correct.
that's
my
understanding
of
the
law
--
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
if
we
win
this
lawsuit,
we
would
ask
as
we
did,
we
have
already
asked
in
the
limitation
action
that
our
action
be
stayed
in
the
united
states
--
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
no
sir
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
we
have
one
of
the
concerns
here
and
concerns
in
some
of
the
cases
is
what
about
the
zapata's
security
after
all
they
brought
in
rem
suit.
the
purpose
for
bringing
in
rem
suit
is
to
obtain
security
and
we
did
post
security
and
we
post
a
bond
to
limitation
action,
and
one
of
the
reasons
that
action
in
tampa
would
remain
on
file
is
because
we
have
offer
to
make
that
security
available
to
zapata,
not
remove
it.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
that
is
correct,
that's
the
purpose
of
the
limitation
action.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
i
say
that
the
claimant
that
is
subject
to
a
forum
provision
must
litigate
where
the
contract
calls
for.
obviously,
we
can't
bargain
people
that
weren't
parties
to
the
contract.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
we
got
a
restraining
order
of
the
initial
suit.
this
is
the
traditional
form
that
--
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
and
they
did,
yes
sir.
and
they
filed
their
claim
in
that
and
that
action
of
course
has
all
the
issues
pending
in
it
that
pended
in
the
original
action.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
i
think
at
this
point
that's
a
safe
assumption
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
it
was
not
necessarily
a
safe
assumption
at
the
time,
that
this
action
was
originally
filed.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
mr.
chief
justice,
evidently
there
would
be
a
slight
distinction
as
a
matter
of
law
because
it
appears
that
arbitration
clauses
now
are
generally
recognized
and
enforced.
we
submit
and
we
have
argued
in
our
briefs
that
there
is
no
logical
reason
for
making
a
distinction
between
an
arbitration
clause
calling
for
arbitration
in
london
or
any
other
forum
and
a
contractual
forum
provision
and
that's
been
fully
argued
i
believe
by
both
parties.
but
there
would
be
that
slight
distinction
in
law
because
i
think
generally
arbitration
clauses
are
enforced
without
any
exceptions
now-a-days.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
i
wasn't
referring
to
the
recognition
as
far
as
the
results
or
what
the
review
might
be.
i
was
referring
to
the
fact
that
arbitration
clause
is
calling
for
arbitration
in
a
foreign
forum
are
generally
recognized
in
force
to
that
extent.
one
important
factor
that
we
also
want
to
make
very
clear
is
with
respect
to
the
limitation
action,
we
were
faced
of
course
with
the
moment,
an
action
is
filed
inevitably,
a
claim
in
this
country.
limitation,
a
petition
for
limitation
or
as
the
party
defendant
seeking
limitation,
this
is
almost
an
inevitable
consequence
of
that
action.
so
that
we
had
to
protect
our
security
in
this
country.
we
had
$3.5
million
security.
so
what
we
did
was
a
reactional
protective
measure,
avail
ourselves
of
a
protective
device
at
a
time
when
the
court
had
not
yet
approved
on
our
original
motion,
and
therefore
we
reasserted
in
that
petition
as
i
have
indicated
before
and
this
is
in
the
appendix,
we
reasserted
the
paramountacy
of
our
forum
provision
and
the
stay,
the
motion
for
stay.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
we
suggest
mr.
justice
brennan
no
for
two
reasons;
number
one,
we
would
not
have
had
a
protection
of
our
security.
we
might
then
be
called
upon
to
post
security
if
any
other
actions
were
filed
and
secondly
and
perhaps
more
importantly,
there
is
balance
in
the
law
at
the
present
time
that
we
cited
the
cases
and
the
comment
by
gilmore
and
blacks
on
that
point,
there
is
doubt
at
the
present
time
whether
defensive
limitation
is
permissible
after
six
months
have
expired
and
that
comes
about
as
the
moral
castle
amendment,
1937
when
the
six
months
provision
was
first
introduced
in
the
law
and
it's
not
entirely
clear
at
this
point
in
decisions
since
then
whether
you
can
file
defensive
limitation
after
the
expiration
of
six
months
and
in
any
event,
what
zapata
argues
is
that
in
the
limitation
proceeding,
we
are
invoking
the
benefits
of
the
limitation
act,
the
privilege
as
they
put
it.
well,
you
invoke
that
by
answer
or
by
petition,
so
you
are
subject
to
the
same
objection.
there
has
been
an
urging
here
with
respect
to
carbon
black
and
that
our
forum
provision
in
this
case
is
governed
by
carbon
black.
there
are
several
distinctions,
they
are
made
in
the
brief
but
the
principle
ones
are
in
carbon
black,
the
forum
clause
related
only
to
actions
against
the
master,
owner
or
agent,
that
is
it
was
person
stipulated
who
could
not
be
sued
and
fifth
circuit
ceased
upon
that
to
say
that
this
was
directed
in
personam
suits
and
not
in
rem
suits.
so
that's
one
distinction.
the
second
distinction
is
that
carbon
black
is
a
carriage
of
(inaudible)
case
and
therefore
governed
by
the
provisions
of
that
federal
statute
and
that
does
make
a
difference
and
that
difference
i
think
is
officially
discussed
in
briefs.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
yes
sir.
i
think
the
forum
clause
compelled
us
to
go
to
london
for
all
remedies
available
in
london
including
limitation
and
not
in
the
us.
in
so
far
as
zapata
is
concerned,
mr.
justice
white,
now
if
there
was
a
suit
by
a
third
person
not
subject
to
the
provisions
of
the
towage
contract,
obviously
we
could
file
limitation
--
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
yes
sir
and
i
think
the
limitations
court
would
say
that
since
zapata
is
compelled
by
contract
to
file
its
claim
in
london,
they
may
file
a
claim
in
london.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
they
can
or
should.
just
like
unterweser
would
have
to
file
its
limitation
claim
in
so
far
as
zapata
is
concerned
in
london
because
the
contract
is
binding
only
on
those
two
not
on
the
seamen
that
travel
on
the
chaparral.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
no
sir,
because
it
would
have
been
a
limitation
action
pending
in
london
presumably.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
no,
obviously
zapata
hadn't
sued
us
there,
there
would
be
no
limitation
action
in
london
but
if
the
contract
had
been
complied
with,
all
of
the
issues
in
this
clause,
including
limitation
would
have
been
before
the
london
high
court
of
justice.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
i
think
absolutely,
successfully.
i
think
we
could
have
--
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
yes
sir,
because
we
would
not
have
filed
the
limitation
--
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
well
i
feel
i
do
because
the
action
would,
there
would
have
been
a
limitation
action
pending
in
london
presumably.
this
could
only
have
happened
if
zapata
had
gone
to
london
and
they
would
have
been
engaged
in
all
the
issues
that
would
have
been
in
london.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
this
is
just
a
difference
in
the
limitation
funds
in
the
two
countries.
the
limitation
fund
in
great
britain
is
smaller
than
the
limitation
fund
in
the
us.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
yes
sir,
$80,000,
yes
sir.
mr.
david
c.
g.
kerr
it's
$1,
390,000
which
is
presently
the
established
value
of
the
bremen
at
the
present
juncture
of
the
proceedings.
