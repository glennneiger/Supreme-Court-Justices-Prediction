justice

rehnquist
mr.
kerr,
does
english
law
recognize
the
type
of
admiralty
limitation
proceeding
that
the
united
stated
laws
do.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
as
you
suggest,
zapata
had
performed
it's
obligation
under
the
contract
to
resort
to
the
british
forum.
what
proceeding
would
zapata
have
brought
rather
than
the
one
it
did
bring
in
florida?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
nance
what
do
you
say
unterweser
should
have
done
in
order
to
conserve
its
rights
after
your
client
had
the
ship
arrested
in
tampa,
do
you
feel
apparently
they
did
more
than
they
ought
to
have
in
order
to
preserve
their
rights
to
go
to
london,
what
do
you
say
they
should
have
done?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
should
unterweser
have
done
after
your
client
had
the
ship
arrested
in
tampa,
in
order
to
fully
preserve
its
rights
in
this
action
and
still
not
avoid
a
waiver
of
its
claim
to
have
it
submitted
to
the
high
court
of
london.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
it
be
of
any
help?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
i
tried
to
restate
it.
it's
my
understanding
that
the
proceedings
in
the
federal
court
who
are
instituted
by
your
client
by
the
arrest
of
the
tug
when
it
arrived.
is
your
position
is
that
result
subsequent
actions
taken
by
the
unterweser
in
that
act,
they
have
somehow
waived
their
claim
to
assert
the
forum
clause.
at
least
they
have
submitted
themselves
to
the
jurisdiction
of
that
court.
my
question
is
assuming
that
i
think
that
they
have
a
right
to
take
whatever
precautionary
steps
that
they
feel
are
necessary
to
preserve
their
rights
in
the
tampa
litigation
case
they
lose
on
this
point,
or
would
you
have
them
do
differently,
and
sort
of
--
so
they
wouldn't
say
they
had
submitted
themselves
in
the
jurisdiction.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
they
assert
lack
of
jurisdiction
in
the
answer?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
they
should
done
it
by
motion
rather
than
the
answer?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
kerr,
i
suppose
there
is
at
least
a
practical
presumption
that
no
other
claimants
have
appeared
on
the
scene
since
the
time
of
the
act.
so
there
probably
are
no
other
claimants,
isn't
it?
