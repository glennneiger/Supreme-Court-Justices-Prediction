we’ll
hear
arguments
now
in
mcclanahan
v.
morauer
&
harzell,
5097.
mr.
smith,
you
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn’t
the
--
doesn’t
this
case
turn
on
whether
the
enterprise
that
took
place
in
the
judge’s
chambers
that
this
is
judicial
determination
or
a
compromised
settlement,
isn’t
that
the
heart
of
the
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
the
part
of
you
thesis
that
if
a
judge
suggests
a
figure
of
settlement,
assuming
that
he
did
so
here,
that
takes
it
out
of
the
compromise
area
and
makes
it
into
a
judicial
evaluation,
or
judicial
determination?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
he
had
enough
to
decide
the
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
why
shouldn’t
we
have
district
judges
dispose
of
all
cases
without
trial
on
the
pretrial
statement?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
you’re
saying
adds
up
to
the
proposition
that
when
a
judge,
trial
judge
gets
into
the
process
of
settlement,
which
up
to
now
i
thought
was
something
to
be
encouraged.
he
is
making
a
judicial
determination
rather
than
presiding
over
compromise
of
settlement
conference,
does
this
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i’m
talking
about
cases
that
go
on
everyday
in
every
courthouse
in
the
country
to
dispose
of
cases
without
trial
by
having
the
parties
come
into
the
judge’s
chambers,
and
the
lawyers
have
discussions
back
and
forth
and
they
finally
reach
the
settlement
figure.
now,
in
--
i’m
--
that’s
a
common
practice
you
know
first.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
it
certainly
one
to
be
encouraged,
doesn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
then
you
want
in
your
argument
though
is,
that
can
be
reopened
after
both
parties
have
agreed
to
it,
months
or
years
past,
one
party
can
come
in
and
challenge
the
agreement,
the
settlement
agreement
and
bring
on
a
new
trial
all
over
again.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wasn’t
that
done
in
the
settlement
of
every
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
as
justice
marshall
suggested,
that’s
a
case
where
all
the
facts
are
in.
the
case
has
been
completely
tried.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
would
you
concede
that
if
this
case
had
been
tried,
and
all
the
evidence
had
come
in,
there
was
always
the
possibility
that
the
claimant
might
get
nothing
at
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
since
we’ve
gotten
off
into
some
practical
things
about
who
initiated
the
discussion,
is
it
not
a,
as
a
practical
matter,
isn’t
it
often
happen
that
one
lawyer
wants
to
have
the
settlement
discussion
that
he
doesn’t
want
to
be
the
one
to
initiate
it,
so
he
asks
the
judge
if
he
won’t
do
it,
judge
then
sets
it
in
motion.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
