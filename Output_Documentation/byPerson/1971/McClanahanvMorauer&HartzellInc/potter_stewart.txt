who
took
the
initiative
for
the
meetings
and

youngdahl’s
papers?
justice
potter
stewart
did
he
just
take
the
initiative,
and
so
--
justice
potter
stewart
at
least
there
is
that
significant
distinction
between
the
circumstances
here,
and
a
settlement
worked
out
by
counsel
with
no
participation
by
a
judge
at
all
because
there,
the
initiative
has
to
come
from
one
of
the
lawyers
to
the
other
and
here
the
initiative
came
from
the
judge,
is
that
right?
and
he
had
before
him,
he
had
the
pleadings,
and
he
had
the
deposition
of
the
plaintiff
and
he
had
a
schedule
of
the
special
damages,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
well
you
do
have
this
statement
that
the
$5,000.00
figure
was
judge
youngdahl’s
determination.
i’m
looking
at
page
32
of
the
appendix.
the
witness
says,
“i
don’t
know
whether
i
was
asked
but
i
evaluated
the
case
at,
but
i
know
at
sometime
during
the
discussion
judge
youngdahl
felt
that
the
case
was
worth
$5,000.00,
and
that
was
the
amount
of
the
consent
judgment.
justice
potter
stewart
so
you
have
that
much
indication
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
should
be
--
there’s
no
determination
of
an
evaluation
at
least
by
a
man
who
is
a
united
states
district
judge.
