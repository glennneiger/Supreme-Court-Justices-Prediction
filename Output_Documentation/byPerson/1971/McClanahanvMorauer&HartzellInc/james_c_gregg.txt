mr.
james
c.
gregg
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
i
think
is
adequately
phrased,
with
respect
to
what
transpired
in
judge
youngdahl’s
chambers,
the
only
evidence
on
that
point,
that
is
in
the
record
is
contained
in
the
testimony
of
mr.
mahoney
who
was
the
lawyer
representing
the
defendant
in
the
third
party.
this
testimony
starts
on
page
31
of
the
transcript
of
proceedings
and
as
he
said
on
page
32
with
respect
to
the
conference
before
judge
youngdahl,
as
i
recall
it
was
done
in
his
usual
manner,
but
he
discussed
this
settlement
with
both
of
us
first,
and
then
i
believe
i
left
the
room.
the
settlement
was
discussed
with
you,
meaning
counsel,
and
then
i
was
called
back
in
and
you
left
the
room
and
our
figures
were
discussed
then.
as
a
result
of
the
conference,
an
agreement
was
reached
at
$5,000.00.
this
is
the
testimony
of
mr.
mahoney,
the
witness,
offered
by
counsel
for
the
petitioner
during
the
workman’s
compensation
proceedings.
he
was
--
mr.
mahoney
was
further
examined
with
respect
to
the
question
as
to
why
it
was
that
a
consent
judgment
was
entered
in
this
case
as
distinguished
in
the
usual
procedure
of
just
filing
a
praecipe
entering
the
case
is
settled
and
dismissed.
i
was
questioning
him
about
that,
and
i
said,
“you’ve
had
several
cases
come
up
for
trial
before
judge
youngdahl,
have
you
not?”
he
said
“yes
sir.”
there
were
of
course
occasions
when
a
consent
judgment
was
entered
into
as
a
result
of
a
conference
in
chambers,
he
answered,
that’s
correct.
question:
primarily,
where
the
plaintiff
is
an
infant?
he
nods
and
said
yes.
question:
otherwise,
generally
speaking,
a
praecipe
is
merely
filed
entering
the
case
as
settled
and
dismissed
with
prejudice?
that’s
true.
question:
was
there
any
discussion
between
the
plaintiff’s
lawyer
and
the
judge
that
this
consent
judgment
was
necessary
in
order
to
eliminate
the
workman’s
compensation
carrier’s
interest
in
the
case,
or
to
provide
a
means
of
avoiding
the
settlement
provisions
under
workman’s
compensation
act?
as
to
--
according
to
mr.
mahoney,
the
answer
was
no.
question:
then
why
was
it
that
with
an
adult
plaintiff,
a
consent
judgment
was
entered
into
in
this
case
when
there
had
been
no
real
trial
on
the
merits?
answer:
for
the
protection
of
all
concerned.
it
was
felt
that
this
consent
judgment
should
be
entered
into.
question:
for
the
protection,
meaning
the
protection
against
the
ramifications
of
the
workman’s
compensation
act?
answer:
no.
all
concerned
which
would
be
the
plaintiff
and
the
attorneys
involved.
mr.
mcclanahan
had
had
several
lawyers
that
they’re
under
psychiatric
care.
question:
you
are
implying
then
that
perhaps
mr.
mcclanahan
would
not
have
abided
by
the
settlement
without
a
consent
judgment?
no
sir,
i
don’t
imply
that.
question:
but
there
was
no
trial
in
the
merits?
answer:
no
trial
in
the
merits.
question:
no
testimony
was
offered?
that’s
correct.
and
the
jury
was
impelled?
no
verdict
was
rendered.
so
the
question
here
is
whether
a
discussion
of
this
nature
in
the
conference
of
the
judge
prior
to
the
start
of
a
trial
constitutes
as
the
court
has
indicated,
a
judicial
evaluation
of
the
case
as
distinguished
from
a
settlement,
a
judgment
that
merely
affirms
and
ratifies
a
settlement
that
had
previously
been
entered
into
between
the
parties.
this
is
not
a
particularly
noble
question.
in
bell
against
o’hearne
they
cite
marlin
against
cardillo,
and
i’m
quoting,
“the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
colombia
circuit
held
that
a
settlement
between
a
claimant
and
a
third
party,
entered
into
without
the
consent
and
agreement
of
the
employer
or
insurance
carrier,
followed
by
the
entry
of
a
judgment
in
the
agreed
amount,
barred
the
claimant
from
recovering
any
deficiency
benefits
under
the
act.”
the
marlin
case
is
likewise
distinguishable
from
the
instant
case,
bell
against
o’hearne,
where
there
the
settlement,
the
plaintiff’s
claim
was
reached
before
the
court
had
established
the
amount
of
the
third
party’s
liability
and
reduced
it
to
judgment.
in
bell
against
o’hearne
the
court,
fourth
circuit
said,
page
780
of
284
f.2d,
as
we
construe
the
statute,
meaning
the
specific
provision
of
the
longshoreman’s
act
that
we’re
dealing
with
here,
“a
recovery
of
deficiency
compensation
is
barred
only
where
the
injured
employee
or
his
beneficiaries
incase
of
death,
have
compromised
the
third
party
claim,
or
where
judgment
in
the
third
party
action
has
been
entered
as
a
result
of
a
settlement
or
a
compromise.”
the
uncontradicted
evidence
in
this
case
before
the
commission,
and
upon
which
both
the
trial
court
and
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
colombia
acted,
was
that
this
was
a
settlement,
it
was
entered
into,
and
that
the
judgment
in
this
case
was
entered
into
merely
and
solely
for
the
purpose
of
confirming
the
settlement
that
the
parties
had
previously
reached.
the
--
mr.
james
c.
gregg
yes
sir.
mr.
james

gregg

it’s

--
mr.
james
c.
gregg
yes
sir,
in
other
words,
in
this
case
it’s
not
as
clearly
one
way
or
the
other
as
some
cases
are,
but
it
would
seem
to
me
that
when
a
judge
is
evaluating
a
case
for
settlement
purposes,
he
is
considering
a
lot
of
things
that
he
is
not
considering
as
a
trial
of
defect.
he
is
considering
odds
of
recovery,
jury
verdict
ranges,
and
matters
of
that
nature.
it
is
purely
and
simply
a
compromise,
it’s
the
only
real
way
that
we
can
dispose
of
the
case
without
having
additional
proceedings
follow
motions,
appeals,
and
so
forth.
now
the
banks
and
chicago
grain
trimmers
association
case,
which
is
the
most
recent
opinion
of
this
court
dealing
with
this
subject,
involved,
as
justice
marshall
indicated,
the
case
were
--
that
it
go
into
trial,
evidence
been
offered
and
introduced,
involved
the
question
as
to
whether
an
order
of
remittitur
constituted
a
judicial
determination.
it
hardly
seems
worth
mentioning
that
in
order
of
remittitur
would
be
a
judicial
determination
made
by
a
trier,
based
upon
facts,
testimony,
and
evidence
that
was
before
it.
we
submit
to
your
honors
that
the
case
that
we
have
here
is
distinguishable,
and
we
rely
primarily
upon
the
reasoning
employed
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
colombia.
thank
you.

as

at
$5,000.00.

would
