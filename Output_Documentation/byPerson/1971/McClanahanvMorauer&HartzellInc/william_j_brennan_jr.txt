justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
suppose
in
this
instance,
two
lawyers
had
sat
down,
and
written
out
a
compromise
agreement
and
exchanged
of
releases
or
whatever
without
taking
consent
judgment,
you
wouldn’t
be
here,
would
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
it
wouldn’t
be
a
compromise?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
say
this
was
not
a
compromise
agreement,
but
rather
it
was
something
that
judge
youngdahl
suggested
as
an
amount
by
which
the
case
should
be
disposed
of
and
it
took
the
form
then
of
a
consent
judgment,
is
that
it?
and
you
say
consent
judgment
is
not
a
compromise
agreement
for
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
do
you
--
i
guess
we’ve
all
been
parties
to
these
things.
sometimes
it
takes
the
form
of
a
consent
judgment,
sometime
of
--
exchange
of
releases.
really
what
difference
is
there
between
these
two,
actually?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
i’m
not
to
judge,
no,
the
issue
here
is
whether
there
was
a
compromise
for
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
isn’t
that
it?
it
just
didn’t
take
the
form
of
an
agreement
between
counsel
of
a
sort
that
we’re
familiar
with
where
they
exchange
releases
and
that
sort
of
thing,
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
compromising
in
the
real
sense.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
is
this
the
way
this
thing
is
done
in
the
district
that
you
add
a
consent
judgments
on
these
things
instead
of
settlement
agreement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it’s
quite
a
long
while
since
i
used
to
do
this
sort
of
thing,
both
as
a
trial
judge
and
as
a
practicing
lawyer,
but
where
he
had
instant
cases
in
that
sort
of
thing.
we
used
this
procedure.
it
was
a
necessity
because
of
the
nature
of
the
plaintiff
in
the
case.
the
judgment
was
of
more
protection.
now
is
that
what
this
situation
was?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
must
say,
i
never
regarded
those
infant
settlements
as
any
less
compromising
or
settlements
because
we
had
to
take
this
form
and
edit
them.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
could
have
a
jury
trial
in
the
state
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
it
judge
youngdahl
also
who
suggested
that
this
form
of
reflecting
the
settlement
rather
than
the
praecipe?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
i
am
asking,
was
there
any
suggestion
that
that
form
might
avoid
the
effect
of
the
compromise
provision
in
the
--?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

mentality?
