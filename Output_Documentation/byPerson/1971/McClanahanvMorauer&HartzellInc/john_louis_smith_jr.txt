mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court.
the
chief
issue
in
this
case
involves
sec.
933
(g)
of
the
workman’s
compensation
act
of
the
district
of
colombia
which
is
a
longshoremen’s
and
harbor
worker’s
compensation
act
involves
the
use
of
the
term
“compromise”
involving
settlements
in
which
the
insurance
carry
it
for
the
workman’s
compensation
company
hasn’t
participated.
for
a
brief
history
in
the
case,
mr.
mcclanahan,
the
petitioner
was
injured
on
the
job
on
october
of
1962.
he
seasonably
filed
an
action
in
the
workman’s
compensation
of
the
--
bureau
of
employee’s
compensation
in
the
district
of
colombia,
and
also
a
third
party
action
was
filed
against
a
third
party
tortfeasor
in
the
u.s.
district
court
in
the
district
of
colombia.
the
compensation
claim
was
settled.
award
was
made
of
$3780.00
in
1964.
the
third
party
action
came
up
at
trial
on
february
of
1967.
at
that
time
a
settlement
was
made
in
the
chambers
of
a
judge
luther
youngdahl,
which
an
award
of
$5000.00
was
made,
$3000.00
of
which
went
to
mr.
mcclanahan’s
wife
as
a
consortium,
and
the
balance
of
$2000.00
went
to
the
claimant
mr.
mcclanahan.
a
motion
to
modify
the
workman’s
compensation
award
was
then
filed,
which
was
now
1967,
three
years
after
the
original
claim
has
been
filed
before
the
deputy
commissioner.
a
hearing
was
held
in
december
of
1967
and
april
of
1968,
in
which
the
deputy
commissioner
asked
what
issues
were
before,
i
mean
he
was
advised
that
it
was
just
the
issue
of
the
compromise
of
whether
or
not
this
was
a
judicial
evaluation
made
by
this
consent
judgment
in
the
third
party
case.
the
deputy
commissioner
having
heard
all
these
evidence
made
a
finding
that
it
was
a
judicial
evaluation
and
made
a
temporary
partial
disability
award
of
25%
which
he
stated
entered
in
november
of
1965
that
the
complainant’s
condition
reverted
back
to
a
state
as
that
of
that
time.
motions
for
summary
judgment
were
filed
in
the
u.s.
district
court
in
which
both
sides
argued
that
the
findings
did
not
--
were
not
sustained
by
sufficient
evidence.
judge
hart
(ph)
ruled
in
favor
of
the
respondent
in
this
case,
and
stated
that
it
was
not
a
judicial
evaluation,
that
it
was
a
compromise,
and
that
therefore,
the
claimant
could
not
reach
assurance
to
the
compensation
board
for
further
money.
this
was
appealed
to
the
united
states
district
court,
and
they
affirmed
finding
three
distinctions
between
this
case
and
banks
versus
chicago
grain
trimmers
association,
1968
decision
of
the
united
states
supreme
court.
they
felt
that
it
was
distinguishable,
and
first
of
all
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
not
the
result
--
the
compromise
was
not
the
result
of
a
full
hearing
of
all
the
evidence.
secondly,
that
the
chicago
grain
trimmers
did
involve
a
remittitur,
and
because
of
this
the
party
did
not
have
to
accept
it,
that
this
was
a
judicial
evaluation
by
a
judge
presumably
just
finding
that
his
evaluation,
the
claim,
varied
from
that
of
the
jury,
and
he
had
this
right
to
offer
the
party,
the
remittitur
if
they
wish
to
settle.
and
third,
that
they
were
free
to
reject
this
and
this
freedom
of
reject
resulted
in
prejudice
to
the
employer
and
his
carrier.
now
as
i
urge
your
honor
that
these
decision
in
the
court
below
is
not
in
accord
with
banks
v.
chicago
grain
trimmers,
or
the
bell
versus
o’hern
case
and
this
is
the
grounds
on
which
the
petitioner’s
certiorari
was
filed.
i
urge
that
this
ruling
is
more
in
terms
of
the
earlier
decisions
of
the
--
on
the
section
33
(g)
of
the
longshoreman
and
harbor
worker’s
act,
and
that
the
interpretations
placed
on
it
since
then
by
the
banks
case,
and
bell,
have
shown
a
desire
to
encourage
settlements
your
honor,
and
that
this
decision
will
completely
discourage
him
because
as
a
practical
matter,
it’s
not
very
easy
to
get
an
insurance
carrier
to
agree
to
a
settlement
of
an
award
for
an
amount
less
than
they’ve
already
paid.
the
two
claims
are
not
of
an
equal
footing.
one
being
of
a
nature
of
a
non-fault
insurance,
this
is
really
our
first
kind
of
non-fault
insurance,
and
many
times
as
the
better
case,
especially
if
they
have
very
poor
liability
to
prove
fault.
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
well,
yes
in
effect
your
honor.
what
i’m
saying
is
that
the
banks
case
does
state
in
this
language
that
it
differs
from
these
earlier
cases
in
the
fact
that
it
was
evaluated
by
a
trial
judge.
now
what
i’m
stating
is
that
in
this
particular
instance,
the
trial
judge
had
before
him
certain
information,
perhaps
not
the
information
that
you’d
have
from
a
fully
conducted
trail,
but
he
did
have
the
pretrial
statement,
which
was
available
on
all
those
cases.
he
had
a
deposition
that
had
been
given
by
the
plaintiff.
he
had
something
to
go
on
in
which
to
evaluate.
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
i
think
yes
your
honor.
i
believe
that
he
could
make
a
fair
--
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
well,
i
wouldn’t
go
so
far
as
that
your
honor,
by
all
--
as
i’m
saying
that
i
think
that
he
had
as
much
information
that
is
necessary
to
make
a
fair
evaluation
of
the
claim,
and
that
a
somebody
at
a
later
date
wishes
to
challenge
it.
i
think
that
they
should
have
an
obligation
to
show
that
there
was
some
prejudice
to
them
from
this
settle.
i
don’t
think
that
we
should
presume
conclusively
the
fact
that
the
judge
interceded
in
the
settlement.
that
is
not
a
fair
evaluation
of
the
claim.
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
they
could
reject
it
and
go
to
trial.
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
well
yes
your
honor,
but
of
course
these
other
two
cases
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
well,
yes
your
honor,
but
no
one
had
to
accept
the
remittitur
figure,
he
could
have
gone
to
trial.
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
he
had
all
the
--
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
i
think
mr.
justice
marshall
it’s
a
little
more
than
just
helping
out.
i
think
that
he--
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
well,
he
may
not
have
had
as
many
facts
as
you
would
have
at
a
trial
under
ideal
conditions,
but
i
think
there’s
--
a
many
at
trial
that
you
would
have
just
about
as
much
information
as
he
had.
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
well,
i
feel
your
honor
that
he
did
have
enough
information
before
him
where
he
can
make
an
evaluation
of
it
and
enter
into
a
consent
judgment
which
was
done
in
this
instance.
i
think
that
in
every
case
of
arbitration
of
a
settlement,
we
have
some
limitation
as
to
the
information
that
a
judge
has,
and
i
certainly
can’t
come
forth
and
say
that
he
had
as
much
information
as
he
would
have
had
in
a
full
pledge
trial,
but
i’m
not
sure
that
a
full
pledge
trial
is
necessary
in
all
these
instances
to
evaluate
a
claim.
i
think
that
a
man
who
ascend
district
court
judge,
that’s
--
that
is
a
district
court
has
a
little
greater
ability
of
measuring
a
value
of
a
claim
and
12
people
even
when
they
do
have
all
the
evidence.
he
has
at
least
has
bad
shot
from
the
many
years
of
experience
that
he
decided.
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
yes,
your
honors,
that
probably
the
heart
of
what
i’m
saying,
but
ensuring
these
other
cases
your
honor,
have
come
up
to
what’s
known
to
a
judicial
determination,
and
then
they
settle
for
a
figure
something
less.
i
mean
the
jury
came
in
with
a
$30,000.00
award,
a
remittitur
of
$19,000.00
--
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
yes,
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
i
certainly
feel
that
way,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
i
--
that’s
why
i
feel
strongly
about
up
to
this
point.
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
chief
justice,
i
didn’t
mean
to
relay
anything
of
that
nature.
i
feel
that
once
it
was
entered
into
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
this
case,
the
judge
went
on
the
bench
and
had
the
parties
accept
the
figure
and
then
signed
a
consent
judgment
for
the
amount.
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
well
not
necessarily
your
honor,
sometimes
--
a
praecipe
i
suppose
that
would
be
certainly
close
to
the
same
thing
as
a
consent
judgment.
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
if
the
two
lawyers
were
getting
along,
mr.
justice
brennan?
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
no
i
think
the
--
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
i
don’t
think
a
consent
judgment
to
be
reopened,
i
would
--
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
that
is
correct,
it’s
a
--
it
was
a
settlement,
but
i
think
that
most
all
of
these
cases
mr.
justice
brennan
that
are
really
settlements
and
a
--
you
know
all
the
new
york
cases
cited
by
my
opposing
counsel
involves
settlements.
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
yes,
they
did
--
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
ordinarily
there
--
it
would
be
a
praecipe
mr.
justice
brennan,
signed
by
both
parties
saying
of
a
settlement
dismissed,
and
usually
don’t
even
put
the
figure
down.
in
this
case
we
did
have
a
person
that
had
a
history
of
mental
illnesses,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
was
one
of
the
reasons
that
judge
youngdahl
wanted
a
thought
of
judgment
should
be
in
the
--
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
basically
yes.
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
i
think
this
word
compromise
has
been
a
--
its
been
rather
or
settlements
had
been
rather
--
whether
abused
in
the
interpretations
under
this
act
both
in
new
york
and
here,
because
what
i
never
could
understand
in
these
other
decisions,
it
reach
a
judicial
evaluation
by
a
judgment
and
then
they
had
settled
it
for
a
lesser
figure.
well,
there
was
no
way
the
insurance
cavalry
was
going
to
recoup
what
he
had
lost.
and
one
of
the
cases
cited
by
the
other
side
in
new
york
involved
a
settlement
of
$45,000.00
and
the
other
party
wouldn’t
--
the
insurance
carrier
wouldn’t
sign
a
consent
in
the
--
no,
the
other
side
said
they
were
going
to
appeal,
unless
they
took
$600.00
off
the
judgment
from
a
$45,000.00
judgment
dropped
in
a
$600.00
seems
very
strange
and
yet
the
insurance
carrier
wouldn’t
consent.
although
it
was
filed
to
be
a
judicial
evaluation,
they
felt
that
they
hadn’t
been
prejudiced
by
accepting
a
lesser
amount.
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
i
agree
with
that
your
honor,
but
what
i’m
arguing
is
i
don’t
--
for
the
purpose
of
encouraging
settlement,
i
don’t
think
that
its
necessary
in
every
instance
to
know
every
fact
of
a
case.
i
think
that
what
i’m
arguing
here
causes
to
encourage
the
idea
of
settlements.
now,
to
both
parties
here
were
willing
to
settle.
the
third
party,
the
insurance
carrier
of
the
workman’s
compensation
is
the
only
one
who
objected
to
the
settlement
in
this
instance.
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
i
felt
very
strongly
that
way
your
honor.
i
--
it
was
a
--
i
did
not
start
this,
so
would
i
--
i
was
the
one
who
settled
it
before
judge
youngdahl,
but
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
were
seven
subcontractors
on
the
site
and
the
original
suit
only
sued
one
of
these
people,
and
in
conferences
i
had
with
other
counsel,
they
told
me
that
they
felt
--
in
fact
they
had
it
in
their
pretrial
statement
that
they
were
going
to
produce
evidence
to
show
that
that
the
party
that
was
sued
wasn’t
even
involved
in
the
accident.
and
this
is
part
of
the
reasons
that
encouraged
me
to
want
to
settle
a
claim.
i
felt
very
strongly
that
this
man
was
going
to
get
nothing.
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
judge
youngdahl
did
a
--
mr.
justice
stewart,
he
called
us
into
the
chambers
and
he
has
quite
a
reputation
in
the
district
of
colombia
for
encouraging
settlements,
and
he
was
quite
forceful,
i
will
say.
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
very
definitely.
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
yes,
that
was
in
the
pretrial
statement,
gives
the
theory
of
defense,
gives
the
facts
that
we
all
agree
on,
as
i
would
and
that
of
the
course
is
part
of
the
court
record
in
ca
189563
which
is
in
the
u.s.
district
court
down
here.
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
yes
mr.
justice
--
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
the
consent
judgment?
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
i
can’t
rightly
recall
who
suggested
that.
the
three
of
us
were
in
chambers
together
and
--
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
no,
mr.
justice
brennan,
definitely
it
was
on
the
subject
of
this
man’s
mental
illness.
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
yes
sir,
we
--
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
yes
--
there
was
a
jury
judge
--
trial
demand
made
by
the
counsel
who
filed
it
and
i
was
prepared
to
go
forward
with
the
jury
that
morning.
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
very
definitely
mr.
justice
white,
but
i
also
knew
there
was
a
very
strong
possibility
they’re
going
to
award
him
nothing,
your
honor,
he
ran
fault
basis
of
liability
showing
negligence
and
--
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
yes,
i
certainly
did.
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
i
certainly
did
not.[laughter]
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
i
have
never
personally
had
that
experience,
but
in
this
particular
case,
even
though
--
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
no,
mr.
justice
burger,
the
matter
of
fact,
the
opposing
counsel
was
on
the
floor
above
me
in
my
building,
and
i
never
even
met
him
until
the
morning
we
were
down
here,
and
we
did
not
discuss.
i
was
in
the
case
just
about
four
weeks
prior
to
that.
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
there
is
one
thing
that
i
wanted
to
mention
when
i
was
standing
before
and
i
--
forgot
was,
yesterday
when
i
was
researching
these
new
york
cases
cited
by
mr.
gregg.
i
checked
the
new
york
statute,
and
i’ve
noticed
that
they’ve
changed
their
statute
and
i
felt
the
court
should
be
aware
of
this
because
really
it’s
a
--
its
in
a
mckinney’s
consolidated
laws
of
new
york,
64
workman’s
compensation
law,
section
1549,
the
pocket
supplement,
and
they
had
the
same
similar
language
in
their
compromise
statement
and
then
they
added
on
to
it.
however,
written
approval
of
the
carrier
need
not
be
obtained
if
the
employee
or
his
dependants
obtain
a
compromise
order
from
a
justice
of
the
court
in
which
the
third
party
action
was
pending.
the
papers
upon
an
application
to
compromise
and
settle
such
a
claim
shall
consist
of
the
petition,
the
affidavit
of
the
attorney
and
the
affidavit
of
a
physician,
or
more,
more
than
one
position
if
necessary.
and
it
spelled
out
basically
what
was
a
--
what
should
be
in
this
information,
and
really
did
not
provide
an
awful
lot
more
information
than
was
available
in
this
case
to
judge
youngdahl.
then
copies
of
these
as
--
when
the
judge
arrives
at
a
determination,
copies
of
these
are
served
on
the
carrier
and
if
the
carrier
feels
as
if
that’s
not
enough,
then
they
can
come
in
and
challenge
it,
but
they
have
to
produce
evidence
that
is
not
a
fair
settlement.
and
i
believe
that
this
was
done
in
new
york
by
the
legislature
there
to
encourage
settlements
and
discourages
ideal
of
a
party
who’s
really
not
a
party
toward
frustrating
settlements.
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court.
the
chief
issue
in
this
case
involves
sec.
933
(g)
of
the
workman’s
compensation
act
of
the
district
of
colombia
which
is
a
longshoremen’s
and
harbor
worker’s
compensation
act
involves
the
use
of
the
term
“compromise”
involving
settlements
in
which
the
insurance
carry
it
for
the
workman’s
compensation
company
hasn’t
participated.
for
a
brief
history
in
the
case,
mr.
mcclanahan,
the
petitioner
was
injured
on
the
job
on
october
of
1962.
he
seasonably
filed
an
action
in
the
workman’s
compensation
of
the
--
bureau
of
employee’s
compensation
in
the
district
of
colombia,
and
also
a
third
party
action
was
filed
against
a
third
party
tortfeasor
in
the
u.s.
district
court
in
the
district
of
colombia.
the
compensation
claim
was
settled.
award
was
made
of
$3780.00
in
1964.
the
third
party
action
came
up
at
trial
on
february
of
1967.
at
that
time
a
settlement
was
made
in
the
chambers
of
a
judge
luther
youngdahl,
which
an
award
of
$5000.00
was
made,
$3000.00
of
which
went
to
mr.
mcclanahan’s
wife
as
a
consortium,
and
the
balance
of
$2000.00
went
to
the
claimant
mr.
mcclanahan.
a
motion
to
modify
the
workman’s
compensation
award
was
then
filed,
which
was
now
1967,
three
years
after
the
original
claim
has
been
filed
before
the
deputy
commissioner.
a
hearing
was
held
in
december
of
1967
and
april
of
1968,
in
which
the
deputy
commissioner
asked
what
issues
were
before,
i
mean
he
was
advised
that
it
was
just
the
issue
of
the
compromise
of
whether
or
not
this
was
a
judicial
evaluation
made
by
this
consent
judgment
in
the
third
party
case.
the
deputy
commissioner
having
heard
all
these
evidence
made
a
finding
that
it
was
a
judicial
evaluation
and
made
a
temporary
partial
disability
award
of
25%
which
he
stated
entered
in
november
of
1965
that
the
complainant’s
condition
reverted
back
to
a
state
as
that
of
that
time.
motions
for
summary
judgment
were
filed
in
the
u.s.
district
court
in
which
both
sides
argued
that
the
findings
did
not
--
were
not
sustained
by
sufficient
evidence.
judge
hart
(ph)
ruled
in
favor
of
the
respondent
in
this
case,
and
stated
that
it
was
not
a
judicial
evaluation,
that
it
was
a
compromise,
and
that
therefore,
the
claimant
could
not
reach
assurance
to
the
compensation
board
for
further
money.
this
was
appealed
to
the
united
states
district
court,
and
they
affirmed
finding
three
distinctions
between
this
case
and
banks
versus
chicago
grain
trimmers
association,
1968
decision
of
the
united
states
supreme
court.
they
felt
that
it
was
distinguishable,
and
first
of
all
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
not
the
result
--
the
compromise
was
not
the
result
of
a
full
hearing
of
all
the
evidence.
secondly,
that
the
chicago
grain
trimmers
did
involve
a
remittitur,
and
because
of
this
the
party
did
not
have
to
accept
it,
that
this
was
a
judicial
evaluation
by
a
judge
presumably
just
finding
that
his
evaluation,
the
claim,
varied
from
that
of
the
jury,
and
he
had
this
right
to
offer
the
party,
the
remittitur
if
they
wish
to
settle.
and
third,
that
they
were
free
to
reject
this
and
this
freedom
of
reject
resulted
in
prejudice
to
the
employer
and
his
carrier.
now
as
i
urge
your
honor
that
these
decision
in
the
court
below
is
not
in
accord
with
banks
v.
chicago
grain
trimmers,
or
the
bell
versus
o’hern
case
and
this
is
the
grounds
on
which
the
petitioner’s
certiorari
was
filed.
i
urge
that
this
ruling
is
more
in
terms
of
the
earlier
decisions
of
the
--
on
the
section
33
(g)
of
the
longshoreman
and
harbor
worker’s
act,
and
that
the
interpretations
placed
on
it
since
then
by
the
banks
case,
and
bell,
have
shown
a
desire
to
encourage
settlements
your
honor,
and
that
this
decision
will
completely
discourage
him
because
as
a
practical
matter,
it’s
not
very
easy
to
get
an
insurance
carrier
to
agree
to
a
settlement
of
an
award
for
an
amount
less
than
they’ve
already
paid.
the
two
claims
are
not
of
an
equal
footing.
one
being
of
a
nature
of
a
non-fault
insurance,
this
is
really
our
first
kind
of
non-fault
insurance,
and
many
times
as
the
better
case,
especially
if
they
have
very
poor
liability
to
prove
fault.
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
well,
yes
in
effect
your
honor.
what
i’m
saying
is
that
the
banks
case
does
state
in
this
language
that
it
differs
from
these
earlier
cases
in
the
fact
that
it
was
evaluated
by
a
trial
judge.
now
what
i’m
stating
is
that
in
this
particular
instance,
the
trial
judge
had
before
him
certain
information,
perhaps
not
the
information
that
you’d
have
from
a
fully
conducted
trail,
but
he
did
have
the
pretrial
statement,
which
was
available
on
all
those
cases.
he
had
a
deposition
that
had
been
given
by
the
plaintiff.
he
had
something
to
go
on
in
which
to
evaluate.
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
i
think
yes
your
honor.
i
believe
that
he
could
make
a
fair
--
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
well,
i
wouldn’t
go
so
far
as
that
your
honor,
by
all
--
as
i’m
saying
that
i
think
that
he
had
as
much
information
that
is
necessary
to
make
a
fair
evaluation
of
the
claim,
and
that
a
somebody
at
a
later
date
wishes
to
challenge
it.
i
think
that
they
should
have
an
obligation
to
show
that
there
was
some
prejudice
to
them
from
this
settle.
i
don’t
think
that
we
should
presume
conclusively
the
fact
that
the
judge
interceded
in
the
settlement.
that
is
not
a
fair
evaluation
of
the
claim.
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
they
could
reject
it
and
go
to
trial.
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
well
yes
your
honor,
but
of
course
these
other
two
cases
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
well,
yes
your
honor,
but
no
one
had
to
accept
the
remittitur
figure,
he
could
have
gone
to
trial.
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
he
had
all
the
--
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
i
think
mr.
justice
marshall
it’s
a
little
more
than
just
helping
out.
i
think
that
he--
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
well,
he
may
not
have
had
as
many
facts
as
you
would
have
at
a
trial
under
ideal
conditions,
but
i
think
there’s
--
a
many
at
trial
that
you
would
have
just
about
as
much
information
as
he
had.
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
well,
i
feel
your
honor
that
he
did
have
enough
information
before
him
where
he
can
make
an
evaluation
of
it
and
enter
into
a
consent
judgment
which
was
done
in
this
instance.
i
think
that
in
every
case
of
arbitration
of
a
settlement,
we
have
some
limitation
as
to
the
information
that
a
judge
has,
and
i
certainly
can’t
come
forth
and
say
that
he
had
as
much
information
as
he
would
have
had
in
a
full
pledge
trial,
but
i’m
not
sure
that
a
full
pledge
trial
is
necessary
in
all
these
instances
to
evaluate
a
claim.
i
think
that
a
man
who
ascend
district
court
judge,
that’s
--
that
is
a
district
court
has
a
little
greater
ability
of
measuring
a
value
of
a
claim
and
12
people
even
when
they
do
have
all
the
evidence.
he
has
at
least
has
bad
shot
from
the
many
years
of
experience
that
he
decided.
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
yes,
your
honors,
that
probably
the
heart
of
what
i’m
saying,
but
ensuring
these
other
cases
your
honor,
have
come
up
to
what’s
known
to
a
judicial
determination,
and
then
they
settle
for
a
figure
something
less.
i
mean
the
jury
came
in
with
a
$30,000.00
award,
a
remittitur
of
$19,000.00
--
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
yes,
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
i
certainly
feel
that
way,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
i
--
that’s
why
i
feel
strongly
about
up
to
this
point.
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
chief
justice,
i
didn’t
mean
to
relay
anything
of
that
nature.
i
feel
that
once
it
was
entered
into
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
this
case,
the
judge
went
on
the
bench
and
had
the
parties
accept
the
figure
and
then
signed
a
consent
judgment
for
the
amount.
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
well
not
necessarily
your
honor,
sometimes
--
a
praecipe
i
suppose
that
would
be
certainly
close
to
the
same
thing
as
a
consent
judgment.
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
if
the
two
lawyers
were
getting
along,
mr.
justice
brennan?
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
no
i
think
the
--
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
i
don’t
think
a
consent
judgment
to
be
reopened,
i
would
--
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
that
is
correct,
it’s
a
--
it
was
a
settlement,
but
i
think
that
most
all
of
these
cases
mr.
justice
brennan
that
are
really
settlements
and
a
--
you
know
all
the
new
york
cases
cited
by
my
opposing
counsel
involves
settlements.
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
yes,
they
did
--
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
ordinarily
there
--
it
would
be
a
praecipe
mr.
justice
brennan,
signed
by
both
parties
saying
of
a
settlement
dismissed,
and
usually
don’t
even
put
the
figure
down.
in
this
case
we
did
have
a
person
that
had
a
history
of
mental
illnesses,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
was
one
of
the
reasons
that
judge
youngdahl
wanted
a
thought
of
judgment
should
be
in
the
--
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
basically
yes.
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
i
think
this
word
compromise
has
been
a
--
its
been
rather
or
settlements
had
been
rather
--
whether
abused
in
the
interpretations
under
this
act
both
in
new
york
and
here,
because
what
i
never
could
understand
in
these
other
decisions,
it
reach
a
judicial
evaluation
by
a
judgment
and
then
they
had
settled
it
for
a
lesser
figure.
well,
there
was
no
way
the
insurance
cavalry
was
going
to
recoup
what
he
had
lost.
and
one
of
the
cases
cited
by
the
other
side
in
new
york
involved
a
settlement
of
$45,000.00
and
the
other
party
wouldn’t
--
the
insurance
carrier
wouldn’t
sign
a
consent
in
the
--
no,
the
other
side
said
they
were
going
to
appeal,
unless
they
took
$600.00
off
the
judgment
from
a
$45,000.00
judgment
dropped
in
a
$600.00
seems
very
strange
and
yet
the
insurance
carrier
wouldn’t
consent.
although
it
was
filed
to
be
a
judicial
evaluation,
they
felt
that
they
hadn’t
been
prejudiced
by
accepting
a
lesser
amount.
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
i
agree
with
that
your
honor,
but
what
i’m
arguing
is
i
don’t
--
for
the
purpose
of
encouraging
settlement,
i
don’t
think
that
its
necessary
in
every
instance
to
know
every
fact
of
a
case.
i
think
that
what
i’m
arguing
here
causes
to
encourage
the
idea
of
settlements.
now,
to
both
parties
here
were
willing
to
settle.
the
third
party,
the
insurance
carrier
of
the
workman’s
compensation
is
the
only
one
who
objected
to
the
settlement
in
this
instance.
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
i
felt
very
strongly
that
way
your
honor.
i
--
it
was
a
--
i
did
not
start
this,
so
would
i
--
i
was
the
one
who
settled
it
before
judge
youngdahl,
but
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
were
seven
subcontractors
on
the
site
and
the
original
suit
only
sued
one
of
these
people,
and
in
conferences
i
had
with
other
counsel,
they
told
me
that
they
felt
--
in
fact
they
had
it
in
their
pretrial
statement
that
they
were
going
to
produce
evidence
to
show
that
that
the
party
that
was
sued
wasn’t
even
involved
in
the
accident.
and
this
is
part
of
the
reasons
that
encouraged
me
to
want
to
settle
a
claim.
i
felt
very
strongly
that
this
man
was
going
to
get
nothing.
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
judge
youngdahl
did
a
--
mr.
justice
stewart,
he
called
us
into
the
chambers
and
he
has
quite
a
reputation
in
the
district
of
colombia
for
encouraging
settlements,
and
he
was
quite
forceful,
i
will
say.
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
very
definitely.
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
yes,
that
was
in
the
pretrial
statement,
gives
the
theory
of
defense,
gives
the
facts
that
we
all
agree
on,
as
i
would
and
that
of
the
course
is
part
of
the
court
record
in
ca
189563
which
is
in
the
u.s.
district
court
down
here.
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
yes
mr.
justice
--
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
the
consent
judgment?
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
i
can’t
rightly
recall
who
suggested
that.
the
three
of
us
were
in
chambers
together
and
--
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
no,
mr.
justice
brennan,
definitely
it
was
on
the
subject
of
this
man’s
mental
illness.
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
yes
sir,
we
--
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
yes
--
there
was
a
jury
judge
--
trial
demand
made
by
the
counsel
who
filed
it
and
i
was
prepared
to
go
forward
with
the
jury
that
morning.
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
very
definitely
mr.
justice
white,
but
i
also
knew
there
was
a
very
strong
possibility
they’re
going
to
award
him
nothing,
your
honor,
he
ran
fault
basis
of
liability
showing
negligence
and
--
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
yes,
i
certainly
did.
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
i
certainly
did
not.[laughter]
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
i
have
never
personally
had
that
experience,
but
in
this
particular
case,
even
though
--
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
no,
mr.
justice
burger,
the
matter
of
fact,
the
opposing
counsel
was
on
the
floor
above
me
in
my
building,
and
i
never
even
met
him
until
the
morning
we
were
down
here,
and
we
did
not
discuss.
i
was
in
the
case
just
about
four
weeks
prior
to
that.
mr.
john
louis
smith,
jr.
there
is
one
thing
that
i
wanted
to
mention
when
i
was
standing
before
and
i
--
forgot
was,
yesterday
when
i
was
researching
these
new
york
cases
cited
by
mr.
gregg.
i
checked
the
new
york
statute,
and
i’ve
noticed
that
they’ve
changed
their
statute
and
i
felt
the
court
should
be
aware
of
this
because
really
it’s
a
--
its
in
a
mckinney’s
consolidated
laws
of
new
york,
64
workman’s
compensation
law,
section
1549,
the
pocket
supplement,
and
they
had
the
same
similar
language
in
their
compromise
statement
and
then
they
added
on
to
it.
however,
written
approval
of
the
carrier
need
not
be
obtained
if
the
employee
or
his
dependants
obtain
a
compromise
order
from
a
justice
of
the
court
in
which
the
third
party
action
was
pending.
the
papers
upon
an
application
to
compromise
and
settle
such
a
claim
shall
consist
of
the
petition,
the
affidavit
of
the
attorney
and
the
affidavit
of
a
physician,
or
more,
more
than
one
position
if
necessary.
and
it
spelled
out
basically
what
was
a
--
what
should
be
in
this
information,
and
really
did
not
provide
an
awful
lot
more
information
than
was
available
in
this
case
to
judge
youngdahl.
then
copies
of
these
as
--
when
the
judge
arrives
at
a
determination,
copies
of
these
are
served
on
the
carrier
and
if
the
carrier
feels
as
if
that’s
not
enough,
then
they
can
come
in
and
challenge
it,
but
they
have
to
produce
evidence
that
is
not
a
fair
settlement.
and
i
believe
that
this
was
done
in
new
york
by
the
legislature
there
to
encourage
settlements
and
discourages
ideal
of
a
party
who’s
really
not
a
party
toward
frustrating
settlements.
