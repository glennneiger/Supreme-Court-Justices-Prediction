was
each
one
of
the

attacked?
justice
byron

white
and
how
about
in
the
--
how
about
in
this
record?
is
there
evidence
of
the
invalidity
of
the
prior?
justice
byron

white
was
not
one
other
--
justice
byron

no
evidence
and
for
what
was
that
conviction?
justice
byron

and
the
five

penalty?
justice
byron

two
years,
so
that
--
there
is
not
attack
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
was
impeached
on
that
as
well
as
three
other?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
connection
of
one
of
the
others,
the
record
is
silent
as
to
whether
he

that

on
the
other
two
he
said
he
appeared
in
his
own
person.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
is
this
not
a
proper
proceeding
in
which
to
set
them
aside?
justice
byron

were
here
that
--
excuse
me
--
was
that
not
--
excuse
me
and
he
introduced
evidence
to
--
as
much
as
he
had
to
prove
that,
namely
about
two
of
them,
the
transcript
to
the
proceedings
or
the
docket
entries,
about
three
of
them,
he
did
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
nothing
about
the

justice

so
again,
why
could
not
the
court
here
have
said,
well,
these
--
we
find
or
the
court
finds
that
these
priors
were
--
prior
convictions
were
invalid
since
he
pleaded
guilty
or
was
convicted
without
counsel?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes,
let
us
assume
that
we
said
that
constitutionally
his
sentence
cannot
stand,
but
the
verdict
of
guilty
may
and
all
texas
has
to
do
is
to
is
to
re-sentence
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
sentence
would
be
invalid,
but
with
conviction
would
not
be.
let
us
assume
the
court
held
that.
