mr.
robert
darden
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
has
misrepresented
the
question
and
issue
presented
to
the
court
now
for
review.
in
the
1947
trial
for
rape,
the
state
on
cross-examination
had
otis
loper
to
testify
about
four
prior
convictions.
three
in
the
state
of
mississippi,
one
in
the
state
of
tennessee
and
this
was
for
impeachment
purposes.
now
all
four
of
these
convictions
have
become
final
and
there
has
never
been
any
effort
to
set
any
of
these
cases
aside.
these
convictions
were
valid
for
all
purposes
and
will
remain
valid
until
set
aside
by
the
proper
closed
conviction
of
state
or
federal
proceedings.
mr.
robert
darden
your
honor,
the
--
getting
to
this
in
the
district
court
in
1969,
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
that
was
filed
was
just
to
get
relief
from
the
1947
texas
conviction.
mr.
robert
darden
in
this,
he
asserted
that
the
four
prior
convictions
were
void.
mr.
robert
darden
yes.
mr.
robert
darden
that
is
right,
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
darden
yes,
mr.
justice.
however,
in
our
position
--
mr.
robert
darden
well,
as
was
held
by
the
district
court,
the
district
court's
said
that
the
convictions
were
valid.
mr.
robert
darden
fifth
circuit
pointed
out
in
their
opinion
that
since
the
passing
of
gideon
versus,
i
mean,
the
handing
down
of
the
gideon
versus
wainwright
which
was
six
years
prior
to
his
going
to
trial
in
1969,
he
had
done
nothing
towards
getting
this
removed
from
his
record.
mr.
robert
darden
that
is
true
and
we
are
saying
burgett
does
not
apply.
mr.
robert
darden
yes
sir.
you
are
correct.
mr.
robert
darden
in
that
particular
case,
what
i
understand,
this
was
used
for
enhancement
and
in
order
for
them
to
bring
in
the
original
indictment,
they
also
alleged
the
two
or
three
priors
which
was
a
part
of
this
proceeding.
in
our
case
this
was
for
impeachment
purposes
alone
and
it
was
not
necessary
to
show,
although
that
these
were
valid
convictions.
and
in
the
state
of
texas,
at
that
time
it
was
permissible
to
impeach
any
witness
that
took
the
stand
on
prior
convictions
or
indictment,
information
or
complaint.
so
in
this
particular
case
if
they
had
only
brought
in
the
prior
indictments
which
he
would
not
have
had
an
attorney
either,
we
could
have
been
impeached
him
in
texas
in
1947.
this
law
was
not
changed
until
1951.
mr.
robert
darden
in
1947,
no,
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
darden
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
darden
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
darden
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
darden
well,
this
is
--
our
contention
--
mr.
robert
darden
two
to
death.
mr.
robert
darden
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
darden
it
is
amended
to
enhancement.
if
they
find
that
prior
convictions,
rather
it
is
mandatory.
mr.
robert
darden
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
darden
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
darden
no,
not
the
decision,
i
think
i
have
read
this
prior
to
this.
mr.
robert
darden
this
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
darden
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
darden
well,
the
statute
has
been
changed
to
permit
the
petitioner
or
the
defendant
to
make
a
request
to
have
a
dual
trial
or
to
have
the
judge
sentence
him
depending
on
what
he
wants
to
do.
mr.
robert
darden
in
essence,
probably
he
would
be
given
another
trial
or
permitted
to
plead
for
any
sentence
less
than
50
years.
mr.
robert
darden
of
the
--
yes
sir.
what
we
are
saying
that
loper
is
trying
to
accomplish
both
from
the
lower
courts
and
in
this
court,
well
in
the
lower
court
is
that
this
court
being
petitioned
to
set
aside
the
texas
conviction
and
the
three
mississippi
convictions
and
the
one
tennessee
conviction.
respondent
submits
that
this
court
in
considering
this
question
presented
by
the
petitioner
must
assume
or
they
must
void
the
mississippi
convictions,
the
tennessee
convictions
and
in
order
to
reach
the
question
presented.
the
question
presented
and
that
which
the
court
has
been
requested
to
consider
is
purely
hypothetical,
there
is
no
case
in
controversy
involving
the
prior
void
convictions
for
impeachment
purposes,
the
prior
convictions
involved
were
valid
and
remain
so
until
set
aside
the
proper
proceeding.
under
the
argument
of
appointment
of
counsel
prior
to
gideon
versus
wainwright
which
was
decided
in
1963,
the
state
of
tennessee
and
the
state
of
mississippi
required
appointment
of
counsel
for
indigents
upon
request
and
the
record
is
silent
in
this
case
as
to
whether
or
not
loper
was
indigent
and
that
the
court
had
knowledge
of
this
and
the
record
is
silent
as
to
whether
or
not
he
had
made
a
request
and
that
this
request
had
been
denied.
on
the
point
of
impeachment,
otis
loper
took
the
stand
to
deny
the
assault.
he
also
denied
that
anything
was
wrong
with
the
complaining
witness,
when
he
left
for
town
and
that
if
anything
had
happened
to
the
complaining
witness,
this
was
done
by
the
maggie
boy
(ph).
in
this,
we
feel
that
harris
versus
new
york
is
applicable
in
that
when
a
defendant
takes
the
stand
to
testify,
he
is
to
stay
with
the
truth
and
be
accurate.
not
only
did
loper
deny
the
assault,
but
it
also
gave
an
alibi
that
nothing
was
wrong
with
the
complaining
witness
which
we
found
not
to
be
true
on
the
testimony
of
dr.
weber
and
also
that
if
anything
had
happened
such
as
the
assault,
it
was
the
maggie
boy.
mr.
robert
darden
well
--
mr.
robert
darden
one
was
using
the
statement,
prior
statements
that
did
not
come
under
miranda.
mr.
robert
darden
and
if
we
used
the
same
logic
here,
we
are
talking
about
un-counseled
convictions
introduced
to
impeach
a
witness
at
the
state
--
in
the
stand.
mr.
robert
darden
it
would
depend
on
what
the
defendant
wanted
to
do.
whether
or
not
he
wanted
to
plea
for
a
lesser
sentence
or
wanted
a
new
trial.
mr.
robert
darden
well
this
would
be
--
your
honor
i
think
--mr.
justice
this
would
be
worked
out
with
his
attorney,
him
and
the
prosecutor.
mr.
robert
darden
i
think
this
is
right
based
on
the
agreement
between
counsels.
mr.
robert
darden
and
this
would
be
a
nunc
pro
tunc
judgment
in
it.
mr.
robert
darden
no.
mr.
robert
darden
no.
this
could
your
honor,
could
come
under
nunc
pro
tunc
judgment.
mr.
robert
darden
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
darden
as
of
september,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
darden
this
is
correct,
your
honor.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
show
that
he
even
made
the
request
as
required
in
the
state
of
tennessee
and
in
the
state
of
mississippi
at
that
time
or
that
he
was
indigent
and
that
the
court
had
knowledge
of
it.
mr.
robert
darden
well,
he
came
in,
in
the
hearing
in
1969
in
houston
in
the
district
court
and
said
that
he
could
not
afford
an
attorney,
but
the
cases
in
the
statute
in
tennessee
and
mississippi
which
is
pointed
out
in
my
brief,
states
that
they
have
--
have
knowledge
of
his
indigents
and
that
he
makes
a
request
for
counsel,
this
the
record
is
silent
on.
mr.
robert
darden
the
record
is
silent.
mr.
robert
darden
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
darden
the
only
think,
as
i
remember
mr.
justice
that
he
did
not
waive
counsel,
he
did
not
have
funds
to
employ
a
counsel.
mr.
robert
darden
well,
this
is
just
a
statement
in
the
district
court
from
that
standpoint.
mr.
robert
darden
yes.
but
the
district
judge
did
not
believe
any
of
his
testimony
and
held
that
these
convictions
were
valid.
mr.
robert
darden
yes.
mr.
robert
darden
we
might
add
under
the
impeachment,
any
time
a
witness
takes
the
stand,
his
character
is
an
issue.
the
federal
rule
as
i
have
said
permitted
prior
convictions
for
impeachment
purposes
in
texas
in
1947,
permitted
much
further.
mr.
robert
darden
we
take
the
position
that
it
did
not,
mr.
chief
justice,
based
on
the
facts.
in
their
brief,
they
point
out
that
only
the
eight-year
old
is
the
only
one
that
implicated
otis
loper,
the
defendant.
unfortunately,
in
these
type
of
sex
crimes
there
is
only
two
people
around,
but
she
also
testified
that
this
is
the
same
thing
that
he
had
done
the
year
before
when
she
was
living
with
her
grand
parents
in
alabama
and
that
he
threatened
her
and
she
did
not
tell
them
what
had
happened
and
finally
told
them
that
she
had
fallen
on
stick
to
hurt
herself.
this
is
the
testimony
came
out
and
with
this
along
with
the
fact
that
he
was
not
be,
the
jury
has
now
that
a
prior
offense
had
happened
which
could
justify
the
50
years.
only
thing
he
did
was
“no
i
did
not
do
it,”
but
if
it
happened,
the
maggie
boy
did
it.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
shows
that
the
maggie
boy
was
even
present
at
that
house
on
august
of
1947
or
that
the
boy
was
present
that
friday
before.
it
is
our
position
that
he
has
not
attacked
or
removed
these
convictions
in
the
proper
court
by
going
back
to
the
convicting
court.
therefore,
the
ruling
in
the
state,
i
mean,
in
the
federal
district
court
and
the
fifth
circuit
should
be
upheld.
mr.
robert
darden
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
has
misrepresented
the
question
and
issue
presented
to
the
court
now
for
review.
in
the
1947
trial
for
rape,
the
state
on
cross-examination
had
otis
loper
to
testify
about
four
prior
convictions.
three
in
the
state
of
mississippi,
one
in
the
state
of
tennessee
and
this
was
for
impeachment
purposes.
now
all
four
of
these
convictions
have
become
final
and
there
has
never
been
any
effort
to
set
any
of
these
cases
aside.
these
convictions
were
valid
for
all
purposes
and
will
remain
valid
until
set
aside
by
the
proper
closed
conviction
of
state
or
federal
proceedings.
mr.
robert
darden
your
honor,
the
--
getting
to
this
in
the
district
court
in
1969,
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
that
was
filed
was
just
to
get
relief
from
the
1947
texas
conviction.
mr.
robert
darden
in
this,
he
asserted
that
the
four
prior
convictions
were
void.
mr.
robert
darden
yes.
mr.
robert
darden
that
is
right,
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
darden
yes,
mr.
justice.
however,
in
our
position
--
mr.
robert
darden
well,
as
was
held
by
the
district
court,
the
district
court's
said
that
the
convictions
were
valid.
mr.
robert
darden
fifth
circuit
pointed
out
in
their
opinion
that
since
the
passing
of
gideon
versus,
i
mean,
the
handing
down
of
the
gideon
versus
wainwright
which
was
six
years
prior
to
his
going
to
trial
in
1969,
he
had
done
nothing
towards
getting
this
removed
from
his
record.
mr.
robert
darden
that
is
true
and
we
are
saying
burgett
does
not
apply.
mr.
robert
darden
yes
sir.
you
are
correct.
mr.
robert
darden
in
that
particular
case,
what
i
understand,
this
was
used
for
enhancement
and
in
order
for
them
to
bring
in
the
original
indictment,
they
also
alleged
the
two
or
three
priors
which
was
a
part
of
this
proceeding.
in
our
case
this
was
for
impeachment
purposes
alone
and
it
was
not
necessary
to
show,
although
that
these
were
valid
convictions.
and
in
the
state
of
texas,
at
that
time
it
was
permissible
to
impeach
any
witness
that
took
the
stand
on
prior
convictions
or
indictment,
information
or
complaint.
so
in
this
particular
case
if
they
had
only
brought
in
the
prior
indictments
which
he
would
not
have
had
an
attorney
either,
we
could
have
been
impeached
him
in
texas
in
1947.
this
law
was
not
changed
until
1951.
mr.
robert
darden
in
1947,
no,
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
darden
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
darden
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
darden
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
darden
well,
this
is
--
our
contention
--
mr.
robert
darden
two
to
death.
mr.
robert
darden
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
darden
it
is
amended
to
enhancement.
if
they
find
that
prior
convictions,
rather
it
is
mandatory.
mr.
robert
darden
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
darden
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
darden
no,
not
the
decision,
i
think
i
have
read
this
prior
to
this.
mr.
robert
darden
this
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
darden
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
darden
well,
the
statute
has
been
changed
to
permit
the
petitioner
or
the
defendant
to
make
a
request
to
have
a
dual
trial
or
to
have
the
judge
sentence
him
depending
on
what
he
wants
to
do.
mr.
robert
darden
in
essence,
probably
he
would
be
given
another
trial
or
permitted
to
plead
for
any
sentence
less
than
50
years.
mr.
robert
darden
of
the
--
yes
sir.
what
we
are
saying
that
loper
is
trying
to
accomplish
both
from
the
lower
courts
and
in
this
court,
well
in
the
lower
court
is
that
this
court
being
petitioned
to
set
aside
the
texas
conviction
and
the
three
mississippi
convictions
and
the
one
tennessee
conviction.
respondent
submits
that
this
court
in
considering
this
question
presented
by
the
petitioner
must
assume
or
they
must
void
the
mississippi
convictions,
the
tennessee
convictions
and
in
order
to
reach
the
question
presented.
the
question
presented
and
that
which
the
court
has
been
requested
to
consider
is
purely
hypothetical,
there
is
no
case
in
controversy
involving
the
prior
void
convictions
for
impeachment
purposes,
the
prior
convictions
involved
were
valid
and
remain
so
until
set
aside
the
proper
proceeding.
under
the
argument
of
appointment
of
counsel
prior
to
gideon
versus
wainwright
which
was
decided
in
1963,
the
state
of
tennessee
and
the
state
of
mississippi
required
appointment
of
counsel
for
indigents
upon
request
and
the
record
is
silent
in
this
case
as
to
whether
or
not
loper
was
indigent
and
that
the
court
had
knowledge
of
this
and
the
record
is
silent
as
to
whether
or
not
he
had
made
a
request
and
that
this
request
had
been
denied.
on
the
point
of
impeachment,
otis
loper
took
the
stand
to
deny
the
assault.
he
also
denied
that
anything
was
wrong
with
the
complaining
witness,
when
he
left
for
town
and
that
if
anything
had
happened
to
the
complaining
witness,
this
was
done
by
the
maggie
boy
(ph).
in
this,
we
feel
that
harris
versus
new
york
is
applicable
in
that
when
a
defendant
takes
the
stand
to
testify,
he
is
to
stay
with
the
truth
and
be
accurate.
not
only
did
loper
deny
the
assault,
but
it
also
gave
an
alibi
that
nothing
was
wrong
with
the
complaining
witness
which
we
found
not
to
be
true
on
the
testimony
of
dr.
weber
and
also
that
if
anything
had
happened
such
as
the
assault,
it
was
the
maggie
boy.
mr.
robert
darden
well
--
mr.
robert
darden
one
was
using
the
statement,
prior
statements
that
did
not
come
under
miranda.
mr.
robert
darden
and
if
we
used
the
same
logic
here,
we
are
talking
about
un-counseled
convictions
introduced
to
impeach
a
witness
at
the
state
--
in
the
stand.
mr.
robert
darden
it
would
depend
on
what
the
defendant
wanted
to
do.
whether
or
not
he
wanted
to
plea
for
a
lesser
sentence
or
wanted
a
new
trial.
mr.
robert
darden
well
this
would
be
--
your
honor
i
think
--mr.
justice
this
would
be
worked
out
with
his
attorney,
him
and
the
prosecutor.
mr.
robert
darden
i
think
this
is
right
based
on
the
agreement
between
counsels.
mr.
robert
darden
and
this
would
be
a
nunc
pro
tunc
judgment
in
it.
mr.
robert
darden
no.
mr.
robert
darden
no.
this
could
your
honor,
could
come
under
nunc
pro
tunc
judgment.
mr.
robert
darden
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
darden
as
of
september,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
darden
this
is
correct,
your
honor.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
show
that
he
even
made
the
request
as
required
in
the
state
of
tennessee
and
in
the
state
of
mississippi
at
that
time
or
that
he
was
indigent
and
that
the
court
had
knowledge
of
it.
mr.
robert
darden
well,
he
came
in,
in
the
hearing
in
1969
in
houston
in
the
district
court
and
said
that
he
could
not
afford
an
attorney,
but
the
cases
in
the
statute
in
tennessee
and
mississippi
which
is
pointed
out
in
my
brief,
states
that
they
have
--
have
knowledge
of
his
indigents
and
that
he
makes
a
request
for
counsel,
this
the
record
is
silent
on.
mr.
robert
darden
the
record
is
silent.
mr.
robert
darden
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
darden
the
only
think,
as
i
remember
mr.
justice
that
he
did
not
waive
counsel,
he
did
not
have
funds
to
employ
a
counsel.
mr.
robert
darden
well,
this
is
just
a
statement
in
the
district
court
from
that
standpoint.
mr.
robert
darden
yes.
but
the
district
judge
did
not
believe
any
of
his
testimony
and
held
that
these
convictions
were
valid.
mr.
robert
darden
yes.
mr.
robert
darden
we
might
add
under
the
impeachment,
any
time
a
witness
takes
the
stand,
his
character
is
an
issue.
the
federal
rule
as
i
have
said
permitted
prior
convictions
for
impeachment
purposes
in
texas
in
1947,
permitted
much
further.
mr.
robert
darden
we
take
the
position
that
it
did
not,
mr.
chief
justice,
based
on
the
facts.
in
their
brief,
they
point
out
that
only
the
eight-year
old
is
the
only
one
that
implicated
otis
loper,
the
defendant.
unfortunately,
in
these
type
of
sex
crimes
there
is
only
two
people
around,
but
she
also
testified
that
this
is
the
same
thing
that
he
had
done
the
year
before
when
she
was
living
with
her
grand
parents
in
alabama
and
that
he
threatened
her
and
she
did
not
tell
them
what
had
happened
and
finally
told
them
that
she
had
fallen
on
stick
to
hurt
herself.
this
is
the
testimony
came
out
and
with
this
along
with
the
fact
that
he
was
not
be,
the
jury
has
now
that
a
prior
offense
had
happened
which
could
justify
the
50
years.
only
thing
he
did
was
“no
i
did
not
do
it,”
but
if
it
happened,
the
maggie
boy
did
it.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
shows
that
the
maggie
boy
was
even
present
at
that
house
on
august
of
1947
or
that
the
boy
was
present
that
friday
before.
it
is
our
position
that
he
has
not
attacked
or
removed
these
convictions
in
the
proper
court
by
going
back
to
the
convicting
court.
therefore,
the
ruling
in
the
state,
i
mean,
in
the
federal
district
court
and
the
fifth
circuit
should
be
upheld.
