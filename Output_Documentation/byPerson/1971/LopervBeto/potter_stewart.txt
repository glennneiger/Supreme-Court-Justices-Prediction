justice
potter
stewart
we
have
granted
certiorari
on
this
case
that
we
give
it
a
limited
grant
of
certiorari?
justice
potter
stewart
right
and
do
you
say
this
is
the
only
one.
what
is
the
--
specifically
as
to
the
question
on
which
we
granted?
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
reading
this
now
from
the
petition
for
certiorari?
justice
potter
stewart
i
am
asking
you
to
be
quite
specific,
if
you
will.
justice
potter
stewart
under
that
question,
it
is
not
open
to
us
to
decide
whether
not
the
prior
convictions
were
void,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
have
got
to
be
of
help
to
you
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
much
the
way
decided
it
--
taken
case
to
grant
certiorari
on
was
whether
not
the
use
of
prior
void
convictions
for
impeachment
purposes
violated
the
rule
against
burgett
against
texas,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
we
did
not
decide
the
taken
case
of
whether
or
not
the
issue
or
to
consider
the
issues
of
whether
or
not
these
prior
convictions
were
void.
we
limited
the
grant
of
certiorari,
did
we
not?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
the
petitioner
was
the
only
defense
witness,
was
he
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
daughter
or
stepdaughter
was
the
only
prosecution
witness
as
to
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
--
did
the
jury
set
the
sentence
here?
justice
potter
stewart
that
might
be
of
some
importance.
justice
potter
stewart
but
within
what
bounds
of
discretions,
do
you
know?
justice
potter
stewart
two
years
to
death
and
the
jury
said
50
years
and
then
on
the
text
of
procedures
the
trial
judge,
the
sentencing
judge
obligated
to
take
the
jury’s
assessment
of
the
sentence.
justice
potter
stewart
this
case
did.
justice
potter
stewart
the
jury
could
have
sentenced
him
to
his
--
even
on
fact
finding
ability
to
a
short
term
as
two
years?
justice
potter
stewart
so
it
is
your
submission
that
both
branches
of
burgett
are
involved
here
and
those
--
the
finding
of
guilt
and
the
imposition
of
the
sentence,
the
enhancements
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
should
not
think
you
would
be.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
that
case
bears
on
this
probability?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
is
not
--
in
that
case
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
as
you
have
just
told
us
disagreed
with
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
present
case.
justice
potter
stewart
we
did
not
indicate
any
disapproval
that
we
have
the
ninth
circuit’s
view
then
went
on
to
find
it
was
harmless
error
in
that
case.
justice
potter
stewart
and
we
have
affirmed
the
judgment?
justice
potter
stewart
was
that
not
true
in
burgett
that
they
have
not
been
officially
set
aside
by
some
other
and
conclusively
set
aside
by
some
other
court
before
the
proceedings
begin
in
burgett,
is
that
not
true?
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
but
under
burgett,
he
did
not
have
to?
in
burgett
he
had
done
nothing
either?
justice
potter
stewart
well
it
bears
on
the
point
you
are
now
making,
does
it
not?
maybe
the
overall
decision
does
not
apply,
but
in
burgett
there
-
he
had
done
nothing
independently
until
he
initiated
the
burgett
litigation
to
assert
that
the
priors
were
invalid,
is
that
not
true
or
am
i
mistaken?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
but
whatever
--
whatever
you
could
have
shown,
the
fact
is
here,
you
did
purport
to
show
previous
convictions,
is
that
--
not
as
just
indictment,
you
did
not
say
they
indicted
for
this,
actually
you
said
you
have
been
convicted
out
of
you
--
through
cross-examination,
is
that
not
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
familiar
with
the
tucker
case
decided
this
week?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
you
read
the
court
of
appeals
decision
that
was
affirmed
here
this
week
by
this
court
and
that
held
that
the
--
that
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
here,
required
that
the
case
go
back
for
re-sentencing
because
the
sentencing
body
in
that
case,
the
judge
had
--
he
gave
consideration
to
prior
convictions
that
were
invalid
under
gideon
against
wainwright.
now,
here
the
sentencing
body
was
the
jury
and
it
certainly
had
before
it
these
prior
convictions,
did
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
assuming
what
i
say
is
correct
description
of
the
court
of
appeal’s
decision
in
tucker
and
this
court’s
decision,
would
you
not
think
that
at
least
this
should
go
back
for
re-sentencing
and
under
texas
procedure
i
suppose
that
means
a
new
trial
because
the
guilt,
the
jury
does
--
performs
both
functions
in
texas,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
did
he
say?
did
he
say
anything
about
that
at
the
habeas
corpus?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
record
does
contain?
justice
potter
stewart
right,
under
oath,
i
assume?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
--
it's
a
little
ambiguous,
the
court
of
appeal’s
opinion,
but
the
court
of
appeals
did
proceed
to
decide
the
legal
question,
did
it
not?
it
just
said
we
are
not
--
and
we
did
--
we
hold
that
these
prior
convictions
even
if
invalid
can
be
used
for
impeachment
purposes?
justice
potter
stewart
did
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
we
have
granted
certiorari
on
this
case
that
we
give
it
a
