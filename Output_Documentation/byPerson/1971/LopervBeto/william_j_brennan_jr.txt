i
wonder
if
i
correctly
understood
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice
when
he
asked
you
if
this
went
back
for
re-sentence,
what
the
procedure
is
that
now
would
be
applied,
what
did
you
say
was
--?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

your
mean
that
if
--
it
is
proper
to
say
it
had
to
go
back
for
a
re-sentence,
the
petitioner
would
have
the
option
to
say,
i
want
a
new
trial
rather
than
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
he
has
a
choice,
although
we
send
it
back
only
for
re-sentencing,
he
has
the
choice
of
having
a
new
trial,
is
that
right?
