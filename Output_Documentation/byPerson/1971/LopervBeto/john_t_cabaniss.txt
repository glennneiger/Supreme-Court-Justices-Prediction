mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
constitutional
rights
of
a
criminal
defendant
in
circumstances
where
he
has
been
affected
by
a
collateral
use
of
prior
convictions,
presumably
void
under
gideon.
in
this
case,
the
collateral
use
was
impeachment
of
testimonial
credibility.
loper
was
convicted
in
november
of
1947
in
harris
county
texas
of
the
offense
of
statutory
rape
of
his
eight
year
old
stepdaughter.
at
his
state
court
trial,
the
prosecution's
witness,
the
only
one
to
identify
loper
as
the
violator
was
betty
fay
dorothy
and
she
indicated
he
was
guilty,
he
did
it.
otis
loper
took
the
stand
to
testify
in
his
own
defense.
he
denied
complicity,
denied
guilt
of
the
offense
and
on
cross-examination,
the
state
was
allowed
by
the
court
to
elicit
from
him
details
regarding
prior
convictions
that
he
had
suffered
in
the
states
of
mississippi
and
tennessee.
there
were
four
prior
felony
convictions
in
all
and
the
state
brought
out
the
details
as
to
the
term
of
those
offenses,
where
they
occurred,
that
they
were
all
for
burglary.
in
the
district
court
the
hearing
below,
evidence
was
introduced
regarding
these
prior
convictions.
this
evidence
consisted
both
of
the
testimony
of
loper
as
for
circumstances
surrounding
those
convictions
and
also
consisted
of
certified
records
that
have
been
obtained
from
the
courts
in
those
proceedings
which
reflected
in
most
instances
that
the
defendant
had
appeared
in
the
person
or
he
appeared
in
his
own
proper
person
or
otherwise
silent
regarding
the
presence
or
absence
of
counsel.
it
is
loper’s
contention
that
the
evidence
thus
introduced,
un-contradicted
by
the
state
renders
those
convictions
presumably
void
under
the
mandate
of
this
court
in
gideon.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
he
certainly
did
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
and
he
refused
to
believe
anything
mr.
loper
said,
there
is
no
question
about
that.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
i
am,
your
honor
on
this
basis.
other
courts
have
indicated
in
similar
circumstances
that
it
seems
where
the
defendant,
the
one
who
is
convicted
introduces
testimony
to
the
fact
that
he
did
not
have
counsel,
was
not
represented
by
a
counsel
and
then
he
introduces
evidence
to
corroborate
that
testimony,
in
this
case,
certified
records
of
the
state
court
proceeding,
we
would
contend
that
those
records
are
sufficient
to
carry
his
presumption
that
he
in
fact
was
not
represented
by
a
counsel
and
he
had
not
waived
his
right
to
counsel.
and
that
the
trial
court’s
action
in
disregarding
that,
the
fact
that
the
burden
then
shifted
to
the
state
to
prove
that
he
had
waived
counsel,
we
believe
that
cannot
be
upheld,
that
is
out
contention.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
yes
sir.
you
did,
your
honor.
there
were
seven
points,
in
all
there
were
six
points
i
believe,
raised
in
the
petition
for
cert.
this
is
the
only
one
upon
of
which
the
petition
was
granted.
the
--
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
the
issue
presented
your
honor
is
whether
on
the
facts
presented
by
this
record.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
no
i
am
not.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
the
--
does
the
use
of
prior
void
convictions
for
impeachment
purposes
deprive
a
criminal
defendant
a
due
process
of
law
where
their
use
might
well
have
influenced
the
outcome
of
the
case.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
well
your
honor,
i
had
believed
that
why
--
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
it
seems
to
me
your
honor
that
again
we
are
proceeding
in
this
case,
we
have
throughout
from
the
beginning
proceeded
on
the
basis
--
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
i
will
proceed
to
that
question
your
honor.
mr.
justice,
excuse
me.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
i
am
sorry
i
did
not
understand
your
question
mr.
justice.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
i
will
proceed
to
the
question
of
burgett.
we
have
–
we
had
utilized
burgett
in
the
district
court
and
in
the
fifth
circuit
without
success.
we
had
contended
throughout
that
the
burgett
rationale
applies
to
mr.
loper’s
circumstances
and
that
the
use
against
him
of
the
prior
void
convictions
to
impeach
his
testimonial
credibility
was
a
violation
of
that
rationale.
now,
the
state
contends
and
the
fifth
circuit
has
held
that
we
go
too
far,
that
impeachment,
that
burgett
itself
involved
enhancement
of
punishment
and
that
impeachment
of
testimonial
credibility
is
not
--
it
goes
only
to
credibility.
it
is
not
merely
so
serious
as
enhancement
which
may
add
years
of
imprisonment
to
the
sentence
of
a
defendant.
but
there
are
number
of
factors
we
have
relied
upon
in
asserting
that
burgett
is
not
so
limited.
most
importantly,
although
burgett
did
involve
convictions
of
alleged
in
recidivist
counts,
it
involved
four
prior
convictions
alleged
and
a
texas
indictment.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
burgett
itself
involved
no
enhanced
punishment.
the
evidence
introduced
indicated
that
the
texas
conviction
was
void
on
its
face.
it
was
--
as
our
(inaudible)
was
never
introduced,
the
tennessee
conviction,
it
was
introduced
in
evidence,
was
held
to
be
presumptively
void.
the
court
withdrew
all
evidence
of
those
and
instructed
the
jury
not
to
consider
the
prior
convictions
for
any
purpose.
the
defendant
burgett
was
convicted
and
he
was
sentenced
to
ten
years
imprisonment,
the
maximum
for
the
offense
involved
was
25
years.
so
we
submit
that
the
constitutional
precept
that
was
established
was
on
the
facts
of
burgett,
not
one
that
was
limited
to
a
situation
where
enhancement
occurred
as
the
state
and
the
fifth
circuit
would
have
us
believe.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
the
purpose
your
honor
was
under
recidivist
counts.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
the
point,
i
would
make
your
honor
though
is
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
absence
of
enhancement,
the
result
in
burgett
was
that
the
jury
was
aware
in
its
deliberations
upon
the
primary
substantive
issue
of
guilt
of
four
prior
void
convictions.
now,
what
difference
does
it
make
if
that
was
done
under
enhancement
counts
or
if
it
was
done
to
impeach
the
credibility
of
a
witness
who
took
the
stand
to
testify
in
his
own
defense.
if
the
convictions
were
void
and
the
jury
is
made
aware
of
those
convictions
then
rationale
applies
to
permit
a
conviction
obtained
in
violation
of
gideon
against
wainwright
to
be
used
against
a
person
either
to
support
guilt
or
enhance
punishment
for
another
offense
is
to
erode
the
principle
of
that
case.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
no,
mr.
justice.
the
prosecution
also
put
on
medical
testimony
from
a
doctor
weber
(ph)
which
simply
established
that
apparently
an
offense
had
occurred
and
he
stated
it
was
appeared
to
be
relatively
recent.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
i
believe
so
your
honor,
50
years.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
i
believe
the
jury
did
make
the
sentence,
mr.
justice.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
two
years
to
death.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
mr.
justice,
i
am
not
aware
of
the
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
i
believe
that
is
the
answer.
i
think
he
was
convicted
by
the
jury
and
sentenced.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
i
believe
that
is
the
minimum
in
texas
for
that
offense.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
the
fact
that
it
was
harmful,
that's
what
your
honor.
to
proceed
with
the
fact
of
impeachment,
mr.
chief
justice
has
raised
the
point
that
they
were
in
an
enhancement
context,
but
we
have
tried
to
pull
it
out
that
we
have
a
criminal
defender
who
takes
the
stand
in
his
own
behalf.
his
credibility
is
a
material
factor
to
his
guilt
or
innocence.
if
his
credibility
is
attacked
by
evidence
of
prior
convictions
that
are
void
under
gideon,
such
that
the
guilt
was
not
there
reliably
determined,
the
argument
must
be
made
that
any
conclusion
of
untruthfulness
by
a
jury
of
the
impeached
witness
is
equally
unreliable.
so
it
seems
to
us
to
follow
that
the
impeachment
evidence
of
that
nature
tends
directly
or
indirectly
to
support
guilt
by
causing
the
jury
to
disbelieve
the
testimony
of
loper
and
then
proceed
along
the
lines
where
the
prior
void
conviction
is
used
for
that
purpose
then
the
defendant
clearly
under
burgett
suffers
anew
from
the
deprivation
of
that
sixth
amendment
right.
now
we
are
supported
in
our
conclusion
as
to
the
meaning
of
burgett
by
a
number
of
cases.
they
are
cited
in
the
brief
and
they
are
applicable
to
impeachment
not
just
enhancement
situations,
i
note
in
particular
gilday
against
scafati
which
one
of
the
first
to
the
first
circuit,
was
one
of
the
first
to
--
its
opinion
is
particularly
lucid.
also
the
ninth
circuit
in
tucker
against
united
states,
i
note
that
this
court
on
monday
of
this
week,
disposed
of
that
case
by
remanding
in
a
situation
where
the
sentence
had
been,
i
wouldn't
say
enhanced,
it
was
the
maximum
sentence,
they
had
reversed
because
of
the
possibility
of
prejudice
resulting
from
prior
convictions
there
involved.
we
are
not
disparaged
by
that
case
at
all.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
we
are
not.[laughter
attempt]
the
state
--
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
no,
your
honor,
except
from
the
standpoint
that
i
would
certainly
--
i
like
the
language
about
the
sentence
being
based
upon
this
information
of
the
constitutional
magnitude,
i
would
like
to
utilize
that
one
concept.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
the
ninth
circuit
specifically
decided
that
burgett
included
impeachment,
but
did
on
the
facts
presented
by
that
record
to
go
on
to
determine
that
it
was
there
harmless
error.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
that
is
correct.
the
state
in
its
brief
cites
two
cases
that
i
must
mention.
these
cases
are
harris
against
nelson
and
walder
against
united
states.
these
were
impeachment
cases
and
the
state
asserts
that
these
can
be
relied
upon
as
limiting
the
application
of
burgett.
it
should
be
kept
in
mind
that
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
defense
counsel
is
part
of
its
trial
strategy,
interviews
the
invalid
prior
or
interviews
the
prior
convictions
to
soften
the
blow
so
to
speak,
that
is
often
done
nor
is
this
a
case
for
the
record
will
show
that
loper,
to
boast
for
his
credibility
denied
that
he
had
never
been
convicted
of
crime
on
direct
examination.
the
first
time
these
convictions
were
brought
out
was
by
the
state
in
its
cross-examination
and
it
is
then
on
this
basis
that
neither
harris
nor
walder
would
conclude
that
burgett
would
not
apply
to
the
impeachment
context
situation
--
harris
and
walder
were
both
concerned
with
situation
of
perjury.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
not
at
all
your
honor.
the
right
was
not
yet
decided
and
that
is
of
course
the
reason
why
it
would
be
fruitless
to
search
the
record
for
an
objection
on
the
constitutional
basis
here
involved.
the
district
court
pointed
that
out.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
1969,
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
mr.
chief
justice,
i
did
not
mean
to
imply
that
the
testimony
of
the
defendant
as
to
those
facts
is
all
that
is
needed,
i
do
not
believe
that
is
the
case.
i
am
saying
that
in
this
instance,
that
was
not
all
that
was
introduced.
the
testimony
that
loper
gave
which
judge
connelly
discredited
was,
we
would
like
to
--
collaborated
by
the
certified
records
introduced
at
the
trial
reflecting
--
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
no,
your
honor,
well
it
is
--
i
am
saying
that
it
is
corroboration.
the
aspect
is
that
we
are
not
--
we
do
not
have
a
record
like
burgett
had,
one
in
which
there
were
two
versions
of
a
conviction
in
tennessee
which
were
cited
in
one
of
them
that
the
defendant
--
the
candidate's
prosecutor
and
the
defendant
in
person
and
without
counsel
and
the
second
version
being
simply
the
defendant
in
person.
we
do
not
have
two
entries
involved
here,
but
all
of
the
entries
involved,
none
of
them
recite
that
he
appeared
with
counsel
and
it
can
be
fairly
inferred
from
at
least
one
and
perhaps
others
that
the
wording
used
reflects
that
he
did
not
have
counsel.
for
example
in
the
1940
conviction
the
entry
that
would
appear
was
--
came
the
district
attorney
who
prosecutes
for
the
state
and
came
also
the
defendant
in
his
own
proper
person,
both
of
whom
announced
ready
for
trial.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
your
honor,
under
the
principle
that
i
have
put
forth
a
little
bit
earlier,
i
would
admonish
the
court
that
perhaps
it
could.
what
i
am
suggesting
is,
is
that
although
judge
connelly
discredited
his
testimony
the
rights
involved
here
were
spoken
about
in
burgett
in
no
uncertain
terms.
the
records
in
this
case
are
similar
to
the
record
that
was
introduced
in
trial
in
burgett
insofar
as
the
in
person
aspect.
the
records
do
not
state
one
way
or
the
other
whether
there
was
or
was
not
counsel.
the
court
might
determine
that
in
circumstances
where
the
defendant
has
suffered
this
conviction
has
suffered
impeachment
or
enhancement
contrary
to
the
dictates
of
burgett
and
where
he
introduces
in
addition
to
his
testimony
records
that
are
silent
concerning
either
the
existence
of
counsel
being
there
or
any
waiver
of
counsel,
if
that
is
sufficient
under
the
circumstances
to
shift
to
burden.
i
was
speaking
about
harris
and
walder.
i
only
pointed
out
that
it
seems
to
me
they
are
distinguishable
clearly
as
mr.
chief
justice
said
in
harris,
it
does
not
follow
from
miranda
that
evidence
inadmissible
on
the
prosecutions’
straight
case
in
chief
for
all
purposes
provided
of
course
that
the
trustworthiness
of
the
evidence
satisfies
legal
standards.
we
would
suggest
that
the
miranda
violations
there
involved
in
the
illegal
search
and
seizure
in
walder
are
different
from
the
sixth
amendment
rights
here
involved
with
respect
to
the
prior
convictions
which
are
inherently
unreliable.
they
are
not
trustworthy.
in
addition
the
other
basis
of
course
is
the
fact
that
both
of
those
cases,
this
is
not
one
where
loper
sought
to
commit
perjury
or
he
testified
to
try
to
boast
his
credibility
of
never
having
been
convicted
prior
to
that
time,
so
that
does
not
furnish
a
basis
that
no
perjury
was
involved.
the
state
at
one
point
has
pointed
out
that
this
case
should
not
be
reversed
for
the
--
from
the
standpoint
that
there
was
no
prosecutorial
misconduct
involved
here.
i
was
simply
note
in
passing
that
i
believe
this
issue
is
disposed
of
by
chief
justice
warren
in
his
concurrence
in
burgett
in
which
he
noted
that
it
is
not
simply
errors
based
upon
misconduct
that
can
be
reviewed
by
this
court.
it
is
the
effect
of
those
errors
whether
well
intention
or
not
on
the
constitutionally
protected
the
rights
of
the
criminal
defendant
which
is
all
we
are
concerned
with
here.
i
would
like
to
speak
to
the
issue
of
the
harmless
of
the
error
that
was
involved.
as
i
previously
pointed
out
there
were
two
and
this
is
for
the
prosecution
in
this
case,
but
the
only
testimony
relied
upon
to
establish
loper
as
the
violator
of
this
offense
was
that
of
the
8-year
old
child,
betty
faye
dorothy.
loper
took
the
stand
--
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
it
seems
to
me
your
honor
that
the
last
part
of
that
question
whether
use
might
well
have
influenced
the
outcome
of
the
case,
it
occurred
to
me
that
that
might
indicate
that
the
court
would
consider
whether
or
not
in
the
circumstances
here
presented,
the
prior
convictions
introduced
did
in
fact
influenced
the
jury
in
its
determination.
i
am
suggesting
most
certainly
that
they
did.
it
was
a
--
in
essence
it
was
a
case
that
was
built
upon
a
credibility
determination.
if
the
jury
had
believed
loper’s
verdict
of
the
facts
that
occurred
that
morning,
they
would
have
been
compelled
to
acquitting.
they
did
not
believe
that
they
would
have
convicted
him
and
in
that
background,
the
prejudice,
the
influence
that
resulted
from
introduction
of
the
invalid
priors
before
the
jury
that
refers
to
the
details
of
the
offenses
in
that
posture
on
cross-examination
at
that
time,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
no
way
to
conclude
that
the
error
involved
was
harmless
error,
that
it
was
not
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
there
was
one
prior
--
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
--
prior
conviction,
1932
conviction
on
the
name
of
milton
cummings
as
to
which
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
at
all.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
the
conviction
was
for
burglary,
mr.
justice.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
no
sir.
two
years.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
no.
there
is
no
challenge
in
the
record.
no
record
at
this
time.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
yes,
he
was.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
that
is
of
1931
conviction
in
(inaudible)
mississippi
at
which
time
he
was
17
years
of
age,
the
sentence
was
six
months.
that
was
the
earliest
conviction.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
that
is
correct.
one
said
in
person
and
one
said
in
his
own
proper
person,
that
is
correct.
the
state
apparently
in
its
brief
as
to
this
latter
point,
the
harmfulness
of
the
error
would
argue
that
the
state
was
only
obligated
to
establish
a
prima
facie
case
and
it
did
so
and
that
therefore
there
was
no
harmful
error.
but
in
doing
so
it
would
also
place
the
burden
upon
loper
to
show
that
the
error
was
harmless
error
or
that
is
that
was
--
where
burden
proof
is
issued
upon
otis
loper.
that
as
i
construe
the
cases
it
is
certainly
not
the
case.
the
state
benefited
from
the
transgression
and
accordingly,
it
has
to
prove
to
show
that
the
tainted
evidence
that
was
introduced
to
the
jury
did
not
effect
or
influence
the
jury’s
verdict.
we
do
not
believe
that
it
here
can.
may
i
save
time?
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
one
thing,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
want
to
correct
what
may
have
been
a
misimpression
or
maybe
i
am
not
reading
the
court
correctly.
you
have
spoken
about
sending
the
matter
back
for
re-sentencing
which
appears
to
me
to
be
an
indication
of
limiting
the
concept
to
burgett
to
one
which
in
fact
is
restricted
to
the
situation
of
enhanced
or
increased
punishment.
as
i
have
tried
to
indicate,
i
read
burgett
more
broadly
than
that
and
it
appears
to
me
that
re-sentencing
would
not
be
satisfactory
in
a
circumstance
where
the
invalid
tainted
evidence
introduced
might
have
affect
to
not
only
the
sentencing
of
otis
loper,
but
also
his
conviction
of
guilt
on
the
primary
offense.
it
seems
to
me
in
that
posture
that
the
required
relief
is
not
re-sentencing,
but
avoidance
of
the
conviction
and
i
simply
wanted
to
bring
that
-
-that
point
forward
in
case
i
have
not
made
myself
clear.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
no,
mr.
justice,
i
do
not.
i
am
not
even
sure
where
mr.
loper
is
now.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
yes
mr.
justice
he
was
paroled
and
it
is
my
understanding
he
is
now
working
in
galveston,
texas.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
no
mr.
justice,
i
do
not.
i
am
not
--
but
would
be
used.
i
would
assume
though
--
i
would
believe
that
texas
does
have
procedure
in
a
case
like
this
for
re-sentencing
without
--
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
that
plenary
hearing
without
full
consideration
of
the
matter.
does
the
court
have
further
questions?
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
thank
you.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
constitutional
rights
of
a
criminal
defendant
in
circumstances
where
he
has
been
affected
by
a
collateral
use
of
prior
convictions,
presumably
void
under
gideon.
in
this
case,
the
collateral
use
was
impeachment
of
testimonial
credibility.
loper
was
convicted
in
november
of
1947
in
harris
county
texas
of
the
offense
of
statutory
rape
of
his
eight
year
old
stepdaughter.
at
his
state
court
trial,
the
prosecution's
witness,
the
only
one
to
identify
loper
as
the
violator
was
betty
fay
dorothy
and
she
indicated
he
was
guilty,
he
did
it.
otis
loper
took
the
stand
to
testify
in
his
own
defense.
he
denied
complicity,
denied
guilt
of
the
offense
and
on
cross-examination,
the
state
was
allowed
by
the
court
to
elicit
from
him
details
regarding
prior
convictions
that
he
had
suffered
in
the
states
of
mississippi
and
tennessee.
there
were
four
prior
felony
convictions
in
all
and
the
state
brought
out
the
details
as
to
the
term
of
those
offenses,
where
they
occurred,
that
they
were
all
for
burglary.
in
the
district
court
the
hearing
below,
evidence
was
introduced
regarding
these
prior
convictions.
this
evidence
consisted
both
of
the
testimony
of
loper
as
for
circumstances
surrounding
those
convictions
and
also
consisted
of
certified
records
that
have
been
obtained
from
the
courts
in
those
proceedings
which
reflected
in
most
instances
that
the
defendant
had
appeared
in
the
person
or
he
appeared
in
his
own
proper
person
or
otherwise
silent
regarding
the
presence
or
absence
of
counsel.
it
is
loper’s
contention
that
the
evidence
thus
introduced,
un-contradicted
by
the
state
renders
those
convictions
presumably
void
under
the
mandate
of
this
court
in
gideon.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
he
certainly
did
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
and
he
refused
to
believe
anything
mr.
loper
said,
there
is
no
question
about
that.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
i
am,
your
honor
on
this
basis.
other
courts
have
indicated
in
similar
circumstances
that
it
seems
where
the
defendant,
the
one
who
is
convicted
introduces
testimony
to
the
fact
that
he
did
not
have
counsel,
was
not
represented
by
a
counsel
and
then
he
introduces
evidence
to
corroborate
that
testimony,
in
this
case,
certified
records
of
the
state
court
proceeding,
we
would
contend
that
those
records
are
sufficient
to
carry
his
presumption
that
he
in
fact
was
not
represented
by
a
counsel
and
he
had
not
waived
his
right
to
counsel.
and
that
the
trial
court’s
action
in
disregarding
that,
the
fact
that
the
burden
then
shifted
to
the
state
to
prove
that
he
had
waived
counsel,
we
believe
that
cannot
be
upheld,
that
is
out
contention.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
yes
sir.
you
did,
your
honor.
there
were
seven
points,
in
all
there
were
six
points
i
believe,
raised
in
the
petition
for
cert.
this
is
the
only
one
upon
of
which
the
petition
was
granted.
the
--
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
the
issue
presented
your
honor
is
whether
on
the
facts
presented
by
this
record.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
no
i
am
not.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
the
--
does
the
use
of
prior
void
convictions
for
impeachment
purposes
deprive
a
criminal
defendant
a
due
process
of
law
where
their
use
might
well
have
influenced
the
outcome
of
the
case.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
well
your
honor,
i
had
believed
that
why
--
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
it
seems
to
me
your
honor
that
again
we
are
proceeding
in
this
case,
we
have
throughout
from
the
beginning
proceeded
on
the
basis
--
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
i
will
proceed
to
that
question
your
honor.
mr.
justice,
excuse
me.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
i
am
sorry
i
did
not
understand
your
question
mr.
justice.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
i
will
proceed
to
the
question
of
burgett.
we
have
–
we
had
utilized
burgett
in
the
district
court
and
in
the
fifth
circuit
without
success.
we
had
contended
throughout
that
the
burgett
rationale
applies
to
mr.
loper’s
circumstances
and
that
the
use
against
him
of
the
prior
void
convictions
to
impeach
his
testimonial
credibility
was
a
violation
of
that
rationale.
now,
the
state
contends
and
the
fifth
circuit
has
held
that
we
go
too
far,
that
impeachment,
that
burgett
itself
involved
enhancement
of
punishment
and
that
impeachment
of
testimonial
credibility
is
not
--
it
goes
only
to
credibility.
it
is
not
merely
so
serious
as
enhancement
which
may
add
years
of
imprisonment
to
the
sentence
of
a
defendant.
but
there
are
number
of
factors
we
have
relied
upon
in
asserting
that
burgett
is
not
so
limited.
most
importantly,
although
burgett
did
involve
convictions
of
alleged
in
recidivist
counts,
it
involved
four
prior
convictions
alleged
and
a
texas
indictment.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
burgett
itself
involved
no
enhanced
punishment.
the
evidence
introduced
indicated
that
the
texas
conviction
was
void
on
its
face.
it
was
--
as
our
(inaudible)
was
never
introduced,
the
tennessee
conviction,
it
was
introduced
in
evidence,
was
held
to
be
presumptively
void.
the
court
withdrew
all
evidence
of
those
and
instructed
the
jury
not
to
consider
the
prior
convictions
for
any
purpose.
the
defendant
burgett
was
convicted
and
he
was
sentenced
to
ten
years
imprisonment,
the
maximum
for
the
offense
involved
was
25
years.
so
we
submit
that
the
constitutional
precept
that
was
established
was
on
the
facts
of
burgett,
not
one
that
was
limited
to
a
situation
where
enhancement
occurred
as
the
state
and
the
fifth
circuit
would
have
us
believe.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
the
purpose
your
honor
was
under
recidivist
counts.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
the
point,
i
would
make
your
honor
though
is
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
absence
of
enhancement,
the
result
in
burgett
was
that
the
jury
was
aware
in
its
deliberations
upon
the
primary
substantive
issue
of
guilt
of
four
prior
void
convictions.
now,
what
difference
does
it
make
if
that
was
done
under
enhancement
counts
or
if
it
was
done
to
impeach
the
credibility
of
a
witness
who
took
the
stand
to
testify
in
his
own
defense.
if
the
convictions
were
void
and
the
jury
is
made
aware
of
those
convictions
then
rationale
applies
to
permit
a
conviction
obtained
in
violation
of
gideon
against
wainwright
to
be
used
against
a
person
either
to
support
guilt
or
enhance
punishment
for
another
offense
is
to
erode
the
principle
of
that
case.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
no,
mr.
justice.
the
prosecution
also
put
on
medical
testimony
from
a
doctor
weber
(ph)
which
simply
established
that
apparently
an
offense
had
occurred
and
he
stated
it
was
appeared
to
be
relatively
recent.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
i
believe
so
your
honor,
50
years.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
i
believe
the
jury
did
make
the
sentence,
mr.
justice.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
two
years
to
death.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
mr.
justice,
i
am
not
aware
of
the
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
i
believe
that
is
the
answer.
i
think
he
was
convicted
by
the
jury
and
sentenced.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
i
believe
that
is
the
minimum
in
texas
for
that
offense.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
the
fact
that
it
was
harmful,
that's
what
your
honor.
to
proceed
with
the
fact
of
impeachment,
mr.
chief
justice
has
raised
the
point
that
they
were
in
an
enhancement
context,
but
we
have
tried
to
pull
it
out
that
we
have
a
criminal
defender
who
takes
the
stand
in
his
own
behalf.
his
credibility
is
a
material
factor
to
his
guilt
or
innocence.
if
his
credibility
is
attacked
by
evidence
of
prior
convictions
that
are
void
under
gideon,
such
that
the
guilt
was
not
there
reliably
determined,
the
argument
must
be
made
that
any
conclusion
of
untruthfulness
by
a
jury
of
the
impeached
witness
is
equally
unreliable.
so
it
seems
to
us
to
follow
that
the
impeachment
evidence
of
that
nature
tends
directly
or
indirectly
to
support
guilt
by
causing
the
jury
to
disbelieve
the
testimony
of
loper
and
then
proceed
along
the
lines
where
the
prior
void
conviction
is
used
for
that
purpose
then
the
defendant
clearly
under
burgett
suffers
anew
from
the
deprivation
of
that
sixth
amendment
right.
now
we
are
supported
in
our
conclusion
as
to
the
meaning
of
burgett
by
a
number
of
cases.
they
are
cited
in
the
brief
and
they
are
applicable
to
impeachment
not
just
enhancement
situations,
i
note
in
particular
gilday
against
scafati
which
one
of
the
first
to
the
first
circuit,
was
one
of
the
first
to
--
its
opinion
is
particularly
lucid.
also
the
ninth
circuit
in
tucker
against
united
states,
i
note
that
this
court
on
monday
of
this
week,
disposed
of
that
case
by
remanding
in
a
situation
where
the
sentence
had
been,
i
wouldn't
say
enhanced,
it
was
the
maximum
sentence,
they
had
reversed
because
of
the
possibility
of
prejudice
resulting
from
prior
convictions
there
involved.
we
are
not
disparaged
by
that
case
at
all.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
we
are
not.[laughter
attempt]
the
state
--
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
no,
your
honor,
except
from
the
standpoint
that
i
would
certainly
--
i
like
the
language
about
the
sentence
being
based
upon
this
information
of
the
constitutional
magnitude,
i
would
like
to
utilize
that
one
concept.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
the
ninth
circuit
specifically
decided
that
burgett
included
impeachment,
but
did
on
the
facts
presented
by
that
record
to
go
on
to
determine
that
it
was
there
harmless
error.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
that
is
correct.
the
state
in
its
brief
cites
two
cases
that
i
must
mention.
these
cases
are
harris
against
nelson
and
walder
against
united
states.
these
were
impeachment
cases
and
the
state
asserts
that
these
can
be
relied
upon
as
limiting
the
application
of
burgett.
it
should
be
kept
in
mind
that
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
defense
counsel
is
part
of
its
trial
strategy,
interviews
the
invalid
prior
or
interviews
the
prior
convictions
to
soften
the
blow
so
to
speak,
that
is
often
done
nor
is
this
a
case
for
the
record
will
show
that
loper,
to
boast
for
his
credibility
denied
that
he
had
never
been
convicted
of
crime
on
direct
examination.
the
first
time
these
convictions
were
brought
out
was
by
the
state
in
its
cross-examination
and
it
is
then
on
this
basis
that
neither
harris
nor
walder
would
conclude
that
burgett
would
not
apply
to
the
impeachment
context
situation
--
harris
and
walder
were
both
concerned
with
situation
of
perjury.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
not
at
all
your
honor.
the
right
was
not
yet
decided
and
that
is
of
course
the
reason
why
it
would
be
fruitless
to
search
the
record
for
an
objection
on
the
constitutional
basis
here
involved.
the
district
court
pointed
that
out.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
1969,
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
mr.
chief
justice,
i
did
not
mean
to
imply
that
the
testimony
of
the
defendant
as
to
those
facts
is
all
that
is
needed,
i
do
not
believe
that
is
the
case.
i
am
saying
that
in
this
instance,
that
was
not
all
that
was
introduced.
the
testimony
that
loper
gave
which
judge
connelly
discredited
was,
we
would
like
to
--
collaborated
by
the
certified
records
introduced
at
the
trial
reflecting
--
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
no,
your
honor,
well
it
is
--
i
am
saying
that
it
is
corroboration.
the
aspect
is
that
we
are
not
--
we
do
not
have
a
record
like
burgett
had,
one
in
which
there
were
two
versions
of
a
conviction
in
tennessee
which
were
cited
in
one
of
them
that
the
defendant
--
the
candidate's
prosecutor
and
the
defendant
in
person
and
without
counsel
and
the
second
version
being
simply
the
defendant
in
person.
we
do
not
have
two
entries
involved
here,
but
all
of
the
entries
involved,
none
of
them
recite
that
he
appeared
with
counsel
and
it
can
be
fairly
inferred
from
at
least
one
and
perhaps
others
that
the
wording
used
reflects
that
he
did
not
have
counsel.
for
example
in
the
1940
conviction
the
entry
that
would
appear
was
--
came
the
district
attorney
who
prosecutes
for
the
state
and
came
also
the
defendant
in
his
own
proper
person,
both
of
whom
announced
ready
for
trial.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
your
honor,
under
the
principle
that
i
have
put
forth
a
little
bit
earlier,
i
would
admonish
the
court
that
perhaps
it
could.
what
i
am
suggesting
is,
is
that
although
judge
connelly
discredited
his
testimony
the
rights
involved
here
were
spoken
about
in
burgett
in
no
uncertain
terms.
the
records
in
this
case
are
similar
to
the
record
that
was
introduced
in
trial
in
burgett
insofar
as
the
in
person
aspect.
the
records
do
not
state
one
way
or
the
other
whether
there
was
or
was
not
counsel.
the
court
might
determine
that
in
circumstances
where
the
defendant
has
suffered
this
conviction
has
suffered
impeachment
or
enhancement
contrary
to
the
dictates
of
burgett
and
where
he
introduces
in
addition
to
his
testimony
records
that
are
silent
concerning
either
the
existence
of
counsel
being
there
or
any
waiver
of
counsel,
if
that
is
sufficient
under
the
circumstances
to
shift
to
burden.
i
was
speaking
about
harris
and
walder.
i
only
pointed
out
that
it
seems
to
me
they
are
distinguishable
clearly
as
mr.
chief
justice
said
in
harris,
it
does
not
follow
from
miranda
that
evidence
inadmissible
on
the
prosecutions’
straight
case
in
chief
for
all
purposes
provided
of
course
that
the
trustworthiness
of
the
evidence
satisfies
legal
standards.
we
would
suggest
that
the
miranda
violations
there
involved
in
the
illegal
search
and
seizure
in
walder
are
different
from
the
sixth
amendment
rights
here
involved
with
respect
to
the
prior
convictions
which
are
inherently
unreliable.
they
are
not
trustworthy.
in
addition
the
other
basis
of
course
is
the
fact
that
both
of
those
cases,
this
is
not
one
where
loper
sought
to
commit
perjury
or
he
testified
to
try
to
boast
his
credibility
of
never
having
been
convicted
prior
to
that
time,
so
that
does
not
furnish
a
basis
that
no
perjury
was
involved.
the
state
at
one
point
has
pointed
out
that
this
case
should
not
be
reversed
for
the
--
from
the
standpoint
that
there
was
no
prosecutorial
misconduct
involved
here.
i
was
simply
note
in
passing
that
i
believe
this
issue
is
disposed
of
by
chief
justice
warren
in
his
concurrence
in
burgett
in
which
he
noted
that
it
is
not
simply
errors
based
upon
misconduct
that
can
be
reviewed
by
this
court.
it
is
the
effect
of
those
errors
whether
well
intention
or
not
on
the
constitutionally
protected
the
rights
of
the
criminal
defendant
which
is
all
we
are
concerned
with
here.
i
would
like
to
speak
to
the
issue
of
the
harmless
of
the
error
that
was
involved.
as
i
previously
pointed
out
there
were
two
and
this
is
for
the
prosecution
in
this
case,
but
the
only
testimony
relied
upon
to
establish
loper
as
the
violator
of
this
offense
was
that
of
the
8-year
old
child,
betty
faye
dorothy.
loper
took
the
stand
--
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
it
seems
to
me
your
honor
that
the
last
part
of
that
question
whether
use
might
well
have
influenced
the
outcome
of
the
case,
it
occurred
to
me
that
that
might
indicate
that
the
court
would
consider
whether
or
not
in
the
circumstances
here
presented,
the
prior
convictions
introduced
did
in
fact
influenced
the
jury
in
its
determination.
i
am
suggesting
most
certainly
that
they
did.
it
was
a
--
in
essence
it
was
a
case
that
was
built
upon
a
credibility
determination.
if
the
jury
had
believed
loper’s
verdict
of
the
facts
that
occurred
that
morning,
they
would
have
been
compelled
to
acquitting.
they
did
not
believe
that
they
would
have
convicted
him
and
in
that
background,
the
prejudice,
the
influence
that
resulted
from
introduction
of
the
invalid
priors
before
the
jury
that
refers
to
the
details
of
the
offenses
in
that
posture
on
cross-examination
at
that
time,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
no
way
to
conclude
that
the
error
involved
was
harmless
error,
that
it
was
not
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
there
was
one
prior
--
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
--
prior
conviction,
1932
conviction
on
the
name
of
milton
cummings
as
to
which
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
at
all.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
the
conviction
was
for
burglary,
mr.
justice.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
no
sir.
two
years.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
no.
there
is
no
challenge
in
the
record.
no
record
at
this
time.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
yes,
he
was.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
that
is
of
1931
conviction
in
(inaudible)
mississippi
at
which
time
he
was
17
years
of
age,
the
sentence
was
six
months.
that
was
the
earliest
conviction.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
that
is
correct.
one
said
in
person
and
one
said
in
his
own
proper
person,
that
is
correct.
the
state
apparently
in
its
brief
as
to
this
latter
point,
the
harmfulness
of
the
error
would
argue
that
the
state
was
only
obligated
to
establish
a
prima
facie
case
and
it
did
so
and
that
therefore
there
was
no
harmful
error.
but
in
doing
so
it
would
also
place
the
burden
upon
loper
to
show
that
the
error
was
harmless
error
or
that
is
that
was
--
where
burden
proof
is
issued
upon
otis
loper.
that
as
i
construe
the
cases
it
is
certainly
not
the
case.
the
state
benefited
from
the
transgression
and
accordingly,
it
has
to
prove
to
show
that
the
tainted
evidence
that
was
introduced
to
the
jury
did
not
effect
or
influence
the
jury’s
verdict.
we
do
not
believe
that
it
here
can.
may
i
save
time?
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
one
thing,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
want
to
correct
what
may
have
been
a
misimpression
or
maybe
i
am
not
reading
the
court
correctly.
you
have
spoken
about
sending
the
matter
back
for
re-sentencing
which
appears
to
me
to
be
an
indication
of
limiting
the
concept
to
burgett
to
one
which
in
fact
is
restricted
to
the
situation
of
enhanced
or
increased
punishment.
as
i
have
tried
to
indicate,
i
read
burgett
more
broadly
than
that
and
it
appears
to
me
that
re-sentencing
would
not
be
satisfactory
in
a
circumstance
where
the
invalid
tainted
evidence
introduced
might
have
affect
to
not
only
the
sentencing
of
otis
loper,
but
also
his
conviction
of
guilt
on
the
primary
offense.
it
seems
to
me
in
that
posture
that
the
required
relief
is
not
re-sentencing,
but
avoidance
of
the
conviction
and
i
simply
wanted
to
bring
that
-
-that
point
forward
in
case
i
have
not
made
myself
clear.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
no,
mr.
justice,
i
do
not.
i
am
not
even
sure
where
mr.
loper
is
now.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
yes
mr.
justice
he
was
paroled
and
it
is
my
understanding
he
is
now
working
in
galveston,
texas.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
no
mr.
justice,
i
do
not.
i
am
not
--
but
would
be
used.
i
would
assume
though
--
i
would
believe
that
texas
does
have
procedure
in
a
case
like
this
for
re-sentencing
without
--
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
that
plenary
hearing
without
full
consideration
of
the
matter.
does
the
court
have
further
questions?
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
cabaniss
thank
you.
