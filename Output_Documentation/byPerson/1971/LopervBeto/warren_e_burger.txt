against
beto.
mr.
cabaniss
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
in
the
burgett
case
what
was
the
purpose
of
the
introduction
of
the
prior
convections,
let
us
forget
the
consequence
for
the
moment,
what
was
the
purpose
of
their
introduction?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
to
enhance
the
punishment.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
whether
the
jury
did
or
did
not
apply
it
that
way
is
as
you
suggest
is
really
not
the
issue,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
there
was
no
occasion
in
1947,
when
this
man
was
tried,
i
suppose
for
him
to
have
any
reason
to
challenge
the
nature
of
the
convictions,
was
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
your
contention
is
that
when
you
are
in
the
district
court
now
in
1970
or
1971,
1970
when
you
were
there
on
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
1969
was
it,
that
at
that
time
you
do
not
have
the
burden
of
proving
that
the
convictions
were
obtained
without
counsel,
that
you
merely
establish
it
by
his
testimony
that
he
did
no
have
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
i
have
heard
what
you
had
to
say
about
them
would
you
--
are
you
telling
us
that
that
strong
collaboration
or
solid
collaboration
of
that
testimony?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
it
possible
that
if
we
agreed,
if
we
decided
to
the
single
question
presented
here
in
your
favor,
namely
that
a
prior
conviction
now
void
under
gideon
may
not
be
used
for
impeachment?
suppose
that
rule
was
established,
could
we
decide
this
case,
resolve
this
case
without
sending
it
back
to
have
a
determination
of
the
status
of
those
convictions,
four
prior
convictions
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
we
concerned
that
the
factual
issue
on
that
score
now
under
the
question,
limited
question
of
this
grant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
cabaniss.
mr.
darden.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
it
--
the
jury
still
perform
the
function
of
the
sentencing
as
it
did
in
1947
when
this
case
was
tried?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh!
if
it
were
sent
back
for
re-sentencing
now,
what
would
be
the
mechanism
of
re-sentencing
under
present
texas
law?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
would
have
the
option
of
a
trial
on
penalty
only?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
here
in
this
case
there
was
no
challenge
to
the
impeaching
material.
the
harris
case
was
one
in
which
the
very
material
used
to
impeach
him
was
being
challenged
and
was
at
issue.
i
have
difficulty
seeing
how
this
is
like
harris.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
both
happen
to
involve
impeachment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
right.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
has
been
paroled
now
in
this?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
mr.
cabaniss
though
is
raising
perhaps
some
alternatively
a
narrower
question
and
that
is
that
in
a
case
such
as
in
texas
in
1947
where
the
jury
imposes
the
sentence
rather
than
the
judge
has
in
most
of
the
jurisdictions,
but
in
texas
in
those
circumstances,
then
the
evidence
of
impeachment
falls
within
the
reach
of
what
the
courts
have
said
is
not
permitted,
that
it
goes
to
enhance
the
punishment
or
at
least
he
argues
that
no
one
can
say
that
it
did
not
increase
the
punishment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
darden.
mr.
cabaniss
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
cabaniss,
you
acted
at
the
request
of
the
courts
and
by
appointment
of
the
court
in
this
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
we
want
to
thank
you
for
your
assistance
for
the
court
and
of

your
assistance
for
the
client
you
represented
