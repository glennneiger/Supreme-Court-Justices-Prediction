unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
that
the
conviction
was
not
for
--
unknown
speaker
probably,
you
mean
that
the
wisconsin
need
know
it
is
not
a
factual
offense?
unknown
speaker
this
could
be
shop
lifting
or
arson
or
--
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
say
we
do
not
have
a
record,
we
have
his
say
so
that
he
was
sitting
in
an
automobile
with
a
juvenile
of
the
same
sex
drinking
beer
but
if
he
does
not
say
what
else
is
going
on.
unknown
speaker
do
we
have
the
report?
unknown
speaker
we
do
know,
do
we?
that
it
was
the
recommendation
of
the
department,
that
your
client
was
in
need
a
specialized
treatment
for
his
mental
aberrations,
i
am
reading
from
your
brief.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
now,
what
is
the
sentence
under
the
sex
crimes
act?
unknown
speaker
it
could
be
a
year?
unknown
speaker
one
half
of
the
year?
unknown
speaker
now
did
you
say
a
judge
has
to
confirm
that
or
what?
unknown
speaker
same
judge
of
the
recent
case?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
now,
when
i
gather,
he
was
extended
for
five
years
until
what
date?
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
interrupt
you
once
more?
unknown
speaker
do
i
understand
you
would
say
that
at
the
end
of
these
five
years
suppose
he
were
recalled
from
parole,
could
be
another
five
years?
unknown
speaker
has
the
supreme
court
laid
down,
any
standard
to
prove?
unknown
speaker
it
has
to
be
–
a
damage
because
as
sexual
elaboration?
unknown
speaker
of
any
kind
in
there?
unknown
speaker
just
a
prison?
unknown
speaker
nobody
has
ever
been
release
as
to
having
recovered?
unknown
speaker
this
extension
of
one
year
is
predicated
upon
the
premise
the
person
has
not
recovered?
unknown
speaker
right!
and
when
you
say
that
this
is
just
a
prison,
does
this
mean
everybody
just
gets
extended
because
there
is
no
treatment
and
no
recovery
in
the
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
but
did
not
agree
on
anything,
that
he
needed
anything.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
would
be
the
basis
upon
which
they
could
terminate
parole?
would
it
has
to
be
a
sexual
offense?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
wisconsin,
there
is
a
general
state
prison?
unknown
speaker
and
this
is
not
it?
unknown
speaker
if
his
parole
were
to
be
revoked,
do
you
have
any
idea
where
he
would
end
up
now?
unknown
speaker
about
the
judge?
unknown
speaker
does
he
have
a
hearing
in
federal
habeas
in
district
court?
unknown
speaker
just
on
the
plea.
unknown
speaker
and
absence
of
hearing,
is
that
a
question
that
was
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
and
under
the
mental
health
act,
would
it
be
committed
as
sexual
--
unknown
speaker
let
me
sure
of
one
thing
though,
had
he
pleaded
not
guilty
to
the
original
charge,
he
would
not
have
had
a
jury
trial?
unknown
speaker
well,
this
sentence
is
just
a
matter
of
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
the
sentencing
procedure
--
it
is
the
sentencing
part
of
that
but
--
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
pleaded
guilty
or
convicted
by
a
jury,
this
process
is
applicable?
unknown
speaker
suppose
that
he
is
charged
larceny
of
a
watch,
may
this
feature
then
be
triggered?
unknown
speaker
like
i
gather
that
mr.
frederick
almost
this
may
be
triggered
by
conviction
for
any
offense,
any
crime
is
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
frederick,
justice
brennan’s
question,
however
so
far
as
the
statute
goes,
has
to
be
answered
yes.
unknown
speaker
except
for
homicide
and
attempted
homicide?
unknown
speaker
those
are
the
exception
made
by
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
and
my
question
is,
let
us
assumes
the
prosecution
for
shoplifting
and
the
psychologist,
psychiatric
tell
us
that
we
do
this
shoplifting
is
motivated
this
statutory
basis
or
for
arson.
and
let
us
assume
a
conviction
for
shoplifting,
then
what
is
it
that
triggers
this
extra
procedure,
does
the
prosecuting
attorney
does
it
or
does
the
judge
do
it
on
his
own
motion
or
--,
what
is
it
that
gives
the
court,
the
idea
or
the
motivation
or
the
triggers
that
affects
the
procedure
in
this
particular
shoplifting
case
as
against
some
other
shoplifting
case
that
this
one
might
come
under
this
wisconsin
sex
crimes
act?
unknown
speaker
that
is
not
all
clear
for
me,
it
is
the
statute
or
from
what
happened
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
that
might
not
at
all,
that
might
be
evidence
that
it
trigger
the
person,
so
much
from
our
department
store.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
not
clear
to
me
still
is
what
the
motivation,
what
the
trigger
is?
what
the
source
is
of
this
extra
hearing
after
plea
of
guilty
or
a
conviction.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
there
are
some
prosecutors
who
charge
this
with
respect
to
every
event?
unknown
speaker
this
person
is
guilty
of
stealing
a
horse
and
on
top
of
that,
i
am
charging
that
he
was
sexually
excited
by
stealing
the
horse?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
repeaters
statute,
you
have
an
objective
test
does
this
person
have
a
record
of
prior
conviction?
there
is
no
such
objectivity,
under
this
statute.
i
still
do
not
understand
what
triggers
this
post
conviction
procedure,
if
anything?
there
is
something
on
that.
unknown
speaker
let
me
be
a
little
more
specific.
is
it
automatic
--,
almost
in
practice
when
there
is
a
charge
of
contributing
to
the
delinquency
of
a
minor.
unknown
speaker
then
where
do
you
send
for
examination?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
if
i
understand
you
that.
the
judge
decides,
he
is
going
to
find
out.
unknown
speaker
so
he
then
orders
--
unknown
speaker
the
first
step
is
the
examination?
unknown
speaker
now,
after
the
examination
is
completed
then
what
else?
unknown
speaker
that
if
the
judge
gets
to
the
court
from
right
where
the
institution
is
and
this
has
--
this
fellow
does
not
--
can
the
judge
sentence
him
or
in
this
case
if
that
happened,
if
it
got
up
to
a
year
and
that
is
then
the
end
of
the
case,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
exactly.
now,
but
now
that
the
report
is,
you
have
to
think
this
fellow
needs
--
then
what
happens?
unknown
speaker
does
it
bring
in
the
people
who
are
prepared
to
report?
unknown
speaker
from
the
institution?
unknown
speaker
i
see
and
then
there
subjected
to
cross
examination?
unknown
speaker
and
then
the
accused,
then
has,
he
can
put
on
his
own
witnesses
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
and
then
what
is
the
final
determination
the
judges
want
--
yes,
he
does
need
them
or
no
he
does
not
--
unknown
speaker
no!
do
you
have
anything
on
the
record
that
disputes
that?
unknown
speaker
i
gather
as
far
as
we
know
this
person
never
had
any
treatment
of
any
kind,
that
it
is.
unknown
speaker
i
think
he
was
released
on
parole?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
gather
you
have
a
parole
board
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
wondered
on
that,
we
can
have
no
idea
of
the
basis
on
which
he
was
paroled.
how
does
that,
that
special
board
determining
that
he
is
now
cured
of
aberrations?
unknown
speaker
they
are
not
sure
there
is
still
a
lot
of
danger
to
the
public?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
finding
must
--
when
it
was
extended
the
finding
must
have
been
that
he
ill
--
unknown
speaker
and
now,
during
the
extended
period,
that
is
now
a
finding,
that
it
is
no
longer
ill.
unknown
speaker
now,
on
what
does
that
predicate?
unknown
speaker
so
if
the
state
possessed
a
state
hearing
in
the
habeas
corpus
of
district
court?
do
you
mean
that
he
would
have
a
hearing
in
this
case,
he
would
not
be
fishing
in
the
dark
?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
do
could
we
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
speaking
that
he
was
the
representative
of
the
federal
court,
does
he?
unknown
speaker
he
filed
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus.
unknown
speaker
and
the
state
resisted
it?
unknown
speaker
and
it
was
dismissed?
unknown
speaker
there
was
never
been
in
the
hearing.
unknown
speaker
none
of
the
things
we
are
discussing
this
morning,
might
have
been
flushed
out
--
unknown
speaker
let
me
clear
one
thing.
as
i
understand
you
this
to
say
in
response
to
justice
brennan's
questions,
there
is
an
examination
every
six-months
under
the
sex
deviant
statute
--
unknown
speaker
after
a
five-year
extension
of
his
term.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
very
difficult
question
do
we
have
some
king
of
record
--
.
unknown
speaker
this
petitioner
on
parole
now?
unknown
speaker
and
that
if
he
will
then
commit
to
a
commitment,
would
he
return
to
the
old
prison,
or
will
he
go
the
mental
health?
unknown
speaker
the
wisconsin
takes
here
a
position
--
unknown
speaker
as
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
that
is
typical
for
a
institution
to
which
civilly
committed
people
--
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
we
have
here
the
wrong
respondent.
unknown
speaker
oh,
yes
they
had
file
the
petition
here
before?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
i
think
we
have
a
case
of
those
circumstances.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
that
the
conviction
was
not
for
--
unknown
speaker
probably,
you
mean
that
the
wisconsin
need
know
it
is
not
a
factual
offense?
unknown
speaker
this
could
be
shop
lifting
or
arson
or
--
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
say
we
do
not
have
a
record,
we
have
his
say
so
that
he
was
sitting
in
an
automobile
with
a
juvenile
of
the
same
sex
drinking
beer
but
if
he
does
not
say
what
else
is
going
on.
unknown
speaker
do
we
have
the
report?
unknown
speaker
we
do
know,
do
we?
that
it
was
the
recommendation
of
the
department,
that
your
client
was
in
need
a
specialized
treatment
for
his
mental
aberrations,
i
am
reading
from
your
brief.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
now,
what
is
the
sentence
under
the
sex
crimes
act?
unknown
speaker
it
could
be
a
year?
unknown
speaker
one
half
of
the
year?
unknown
speaker
now
did
you
say
a
judge
has
to
confirm
that
or
what?
unknown
speaker
same
judge
of
the
recent
case?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
now,
when
i
gather,
he
was
extended
for
five
years
until
what
date?
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
interrupt
you
once
more?
unknown
speaker
do
i
understand
you
would
say
that
at
the
end
of
these
five
years
suppose
he
were
recalled
from
parole,
could
be
another
five
years?
unknown
speaker
has
the
supreme
court
laid
down,
any
standard
to
prove?
unknown
speaker
it
has
to
be
–
a
damage
because
as
sexual
elaboration?
unknown
speaker
of
any
kind
in
there?
unknown
speaker
just
a
prison?
unknown
speaker
nobody
has
ever
been
release
as
to
having
recovered?
unknown
speaker
this
extension
of
one
year
is
predicated
upon
the
premise
the
person
has
not
recovered?
unknown
speaker
right!
and
when
you
say
that
this
is
just
a
prison,
does
this
mean
everybody
just
gets
extended
because
there
is
no
treatment
and
no
recovery
in
the
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
but
did
not
agree
on
anything,
that
he
needed
anything.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
would
be
the
basis
upon
which
they
could
terminate
parole?
would
it
has
to
be
a
sexual
offense?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
wisconsin,
there
is
a
general
state
prison?
unknown
speaker
and
this
is
not
it?
unknown
speaker
if
his
parole
were
to
be
revoked,
do
you
have
any
idea
where
he
would
end
up
now?
unknown
speaker
about
the
judge?
unknown
speaker
does
he
have
a
hearing
in
federal
habeas
in
district
court?
unknown
speaker
just
on
the
plea.
unknown
speaker
and
absence
of
hearing,
is
that
a
question
that
was
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
and
under
the
mental
health
act,
would
it
be
committed
as
sexual
--
unknown
speaker
let
me
sure
of
one
thing
though,
had
he
pleaded
not
guilty
to
the
original
charge,
he
would
not
have
had
a
jury
trial?
unknown
speaker
well,
this
sentence
is
just
a
matter
of
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
the
sentencing
procedure
--
it
is
the
sentencing
part
of
that
but
--
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
pleaded
guilty
or
convicted
by
a
jury,
this
process
is
applicable?
unknown
speaker
suppose
that
he
is
charged
larceny
of
a
watch,
may
this
feature
then
be
triggered?
unknown
speaker
like
i
gather
that
mr.
frederick
almost
this
may
be
triggered
by
conviction
for
any
offense,
any
crime
is
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
frederick,
justice
brennan’s
question,
however
so
far
as
the
statute
goes,
has
to
be
answered
yes.
unknown
speaker
except
for
homicide
and
attempted
homicide?
unknown
speaker
those
are
the
exception
made
by
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
and
my
question
is,
let
us
assumes
the
prosecution
for
shoplifting
and
the
psychologist,
psychiatric
tell
us
that
we
do
this
shoplifting
is
motivated
this
statutory
basis
or
for
arson.
and
let
us
assume
a
conviction
for
shoplifting,
then
what
is
it
that
triggers
this
extra
procedure,
does
the
prosecuting
attorney
does
it
or
does
the
judge
do
it
on
his
own
motion
or
--,
what
is
it
that
gives
the
court,
the
idea
or
the
motivation
or
the
triggers
that
affects
the
procedure
in
this
particular
shoplifting
case
as
against
some
other
shoplifting
case
that
this
one
might
come
under
this
wisconsin
sex
crimes
act?
unknown
speaker
that
is
not
all
clear
for
me,
it
is
the
statute
or
from
what
happened
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
that
might
not
at
all,
that
might
be
evidence
that
it
trigger
the
person,
so
much
from
our
department
store.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
not
clear
to
me
still
is
what
the
motivation,
what
the
trigger
is?
what
the
source
is
of
this
extra
hearing
after
plea
of
guilty
or
a
conviction.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
there
are
some
prosecutors
who
charge
this
with
respect
to
every
event?
unknown
speaker
this
person
is
guilty
of
stealing
a
horse
and
on
top
of
that,
i
am
charging
that
he
was
sexually
excited
by
stealing
the
horse?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
repeaters
statute,
you
have
an
objective
test
does
this
person
have
a
record
of
prior
conviction?
there
is
no
such
objectivity,
under
this
statute.
i
still
do
not
understand
what
triggers
this
post
conviction
procedure,
if
anything?
there
is
something
on
that.
unknown
speaker
let
me
be
a
little
more
specific.
is
it
automatic
--,
almost
in
practice
when
there
is
a
charge
of
contributing
to
the
delinquency
of
a
minor.
unknown
speaker
then
where
do
you
send
for
examination?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
if
i
understand
you
that.
the
judge
decides,
he
is
going
to
find
out.
unknown
speaker
so
he
then
orders
--
unknown
speaker
the
first
step
is
the
examination?
unknown
speaker
now,
after
the
examination
is
completed
then
what
else?
unknown
speaker
that
if
the
judge
gets
to
the
court
from
right
where
the
institution
is
and
this
has
--
this
fellow
does
not
--
can
the
judge
sentence
him
or
in
this
case
if
that
happened,
if
it
got
up
to
a
year
and
that
is
then
the
end
of
the
case,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
exactly.
now,
but
now
that
the
report
is,
you
have
to
think
this
fellow
needs
--
then
what
happens?
unknown
speaker
does
it
bring
in
the
people
who
are
prepared
to
report?
unknown
speaker
from
the
institution?
unknown
speaker
i
see
and
then
there
subjected
to
cross
examination?
unknown
speaker
and
then
the
accused,
then
has,
he
can
put
on
his
own
witnesses
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
and
then
what
is
the
final
determination
the
judges
want
--
yes,
he
does
need
them
or
no
he
does
not
--
unknown
speaker
no!
do
you
have
anything
on
the
record
that
disputes
that?
unknown
speaker
i
gather
as
far
as
we
know
this
person
never
had
any
treatment
of
any
kind,
that
it
is.
unknown
speaker
i
think
he
was
released
on
parole?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
gather
you
have
a
parole
board
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
wondered
on
that,
we
can
have
no
idea
of
the
basis
on
which
he
was
paroled.
how
does
that,
that
special
board
determining
that
he
is
now
cured
of
aberrations?
unknown
speaker
they
are
not
sure
there
is
still
a
lot
of
danger
to
the
public?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
finding
must
--
when
it
was
extended
the
finding
must
have
been
that
he
ill
--
unknown
speaker
and
now,
during
the
extended
period,
that
is
now
a
finding,
that
it
is
no
longer
ill.
unknown
speaker
now,
on
what
does
that
predicate?
unknown
speaker
so
if
the
state
possessed
a
state
hearing
in
the
habeas
corpus
of
district
court?
do
you
mean
that
he
would
have
a
hearing
in
this
case,
he
would
not
be
fishing
in
the
dark
?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
do
could
we
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
speaking
that
he
was
the
representative
of
the
federal
court,
does
he?
unknown
speaker
he
filed
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus.
unknown
speaker
and
the
state
resisted
it?
unknown
speaker
and
it
was
dismissed?
unknown
speaker
there
was
never
been
in
the
hearing.
unknown
speaker
none
of
the
things
we
are
discussing
this
morning,
might
have
been
flushed
out
--
unknown
speaker
let
me
clear
one
thing.
as
i
understand
you
this
to
say
in
response
to
justice
brennan's
questions,
there
is
an
examination
every
six-months
under
the
sex
deviant
statute
--
unknown
speaker
after
a
five-year
extension
of
his
term.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
very
difficult
question
do
we
have
some
king
of
record
--
.
unknown
speaker
this
petitioner
on
parole
now?
unknown
speaker
and
that
if
he
will
then
commit
to
a
commitment,
would
he
return
to
the
old
prison,
or
will
he
go
the
mental
health?
unknown
speaker
the
wisconsin
takes
here
a
position
--
unknown
speaker
as
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
that
is
typical
for
a
institution
to
which
civilly
committed
people
--
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
we
have
here
the
wrong
respondent.
unknown
speaker
oh,
yes
they
had
file
the
petition
here
before?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
i
think
we
have
a
case
of
those
circumstances.
