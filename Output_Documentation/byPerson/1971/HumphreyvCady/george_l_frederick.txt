mr.
george
l.
frederick
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
respondent
here,
warden
cady,
warden
of
wisconsin
state
prison.
perhaps
it
should
be
well
to
begin
by
dealing
with
some
of
the
questions
that
we
are
put
to
mr.
charne.
the
question
on
the
section
as
far
as
discretionary
commitment
is
concerned
is
dealt
within
section
97502,
which
provides
that
if
their
sex
crime
is
defined
there
is
one
in
which
the
desire
for
the
sexual
excitement
existed
in
the
commission
of
the
crime
and
provides
that
the
court
may
take
testimony
after
conviction
if
necessary,
to
determine
that
issue.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
let
me
clarify
that
mr.
chief
justice.
the
way
the
charge
is
booked
is
section
94715,
subsection
1,
subsection
80
which
is
contributing
to
the
delinquency
of
the
child.
the
sex
crimes
act
then
comes
in
to
play
your
honor,
just
as
or
the
closest
analogy
would
be
the
habitual
criminal
statutes
which
we
have
in
wisconsin
section
939.62
where
the
enhanced
punishment
as
a
repeater
comes
into
operation
not
as
an
additional
charge
but
as
an
enhancement
of
punishment
but
there
is
a
separate
finding
and
the
defendant
is
given
notice
before
he
pleads
to
the
offense.
and
of
course,
this
is
our
contention
precisely
that
--
i
have
got
a
stand
here
and
i
cannot
say
anything
outside
the
records
but
it
is
an
inference
i
believe,
your
honor,
from
the
heubner
case
and
the
other
cases
as
i
cite
in
my
brief
such
as
rippon
(ph)
that
the
practice
was
when
this
defendant
entered
his
plea
of
guilty
then
he
was
informed
that
he
might
be
subjected
to
the
disposition
under
the
sex
crimes
act.
now,
the
purpose
for
the
discretionary
element
on
these
crimes
other
than
the
three
mandatory
ones
is
this.
if
you
charge
a
man
with
incest
why
is
necessary
to
take
additional
testimony,
on
that
to
show
that
sexual
excitement
existed
in
the
commission
of
the
crime.
on
the
other
hand,
when
you
charge
a
man
with
contributing
to
the
delinquency
of
a
minor,
then
it
is
after
proposed
to
take
the
testimony
and
--
mr.
george
l.
frederick
in
larceny
of
a
watch,
your
honor
would
be
treated
like
this.
that
would
require
a
separate
hearing
to
show
that
this
particular
individual
was
one
of
the
small
group
that
god
sexual
gratification
from
stealing
the
property
of
others
just
to
some
people
--
mr.
george
l.
frederick
except
that
the
courts
of
wisconsin
supreme
court,
your
honor
has
given
the
--,
what
should
i
say,
a
telegraph
to
prosecutors
and
judges
that
by
the
heubner
decision
that
you
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
stray
too
far-field
on
this.
they
are
going
to
require
some
direct
substantiation
that
the
crime
involved
was
in
fact,
motivated
by
a
desire
for
sexual
gratification.
i
think
as
we
get
further
and
further
in
field.
it
becomes
harder
to
show.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
yes!
mr.
george
l.
frederick
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
i
agree.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
all
right,
your
honor,
now
--
mr.
george
l.
frederick
now,
in
1967,
wisconsin
adopted
the
manifest
injustice
test
for
acceptance
of
the
plea
of
guilty.
at
that
time
of
course,
we
began
to
attempt
to
comply
with
federal
rule
11
and
that
the
trial
judge
had
to
ascertain
that
the
acts
the
person
allegedly
committed
constituted
the
offense.
so
in
the
course
of
adducing
that
information
on
a
guilty
plea,
this
information
might
welcome
to
the
trial
judge’s
attention
or
you
are
quite
correct,
the
district
attorney
could
call
it
to
the
judge's
attention
and
surprisingly
enough
your
honor
defense
attorneys
may
well
call
this
to
the
courts
attention
because
--
mr.
george
l.
frederick
pre-sentence
report
could
and
of
course
on
a
trial
on
the
merits,
then
it
would
become
or
it
might
become
quite
obvious
that
--
mr.
george
l.
frederick
that
is
true.
and
before
the
disposition
under
the
sex
crimes
act
could
be
sustained,
your
honor.
there
would
have
to
be
a
finding
made
on
these
by
the
judge
on
the
record
that
is
the
necessary
sexual
gratification
in
the
connection
with
the
crime
was
present.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
well,
let
me
be
frank
with
you
then,
your
honor
that
the
same
reason
is
why
i
always
charged
the
repeaters
statute
and
the
guys
down
the
hall
in
the
prosecutors
office,
never
did.
it
was
my
right
of
discretion
in
effect
whether
to
charge
a
repeater
or
not.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
none!
mr.
george
l.
frederick
all
our
prosecutor
can
do
in
wisconsin
your
honor
is
to
charge
the
principal
offense.
in
this
case
contributing,
and
then
that
if
and
only
if
the
trial
judge
asked
for
some
recommendation
as
to
disposition
is
the
defendant
likely
to
be
subjected
to
the
act
and
in
wisconsin,
we
have
the
rule
that
the
prosecutors
recommendations
are
not
at
all
binding
on
a
trial
judge.
every
defendant
knows
that,
so
we
have
very
little
justice
in
the
repeaters
statute,
very
seldom
is
the
enhanced
sentence
given.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
no!
it
is
not
automatic
your
honor.
and
what
triggers
it
is,
he
has
a
based
i
think
set
out
from
in
torpy
which
i
cite
in
my
brief.
the
procedure
is
in
wisconsin
as
every
place
else
in
the
union
that
you
often
charge
less
than
the
facts
warrant
and
this
is
a
very
good
clue
that
the
judge
of
course,
if
the
principal
charge
was
in
fact
one
of
the
mandatory
offenses
and
the
prosecutor
moves
to
amend
it
because
he
says,
your
honor
i
feel
that
i
cannot
maintain
my
burden
of
proof.
this
would
be
a
clear
instance
of
when
the
judge
would
be
alerted
to
take
discretionary
action
under
that
provision
97502
of
the
statutes.
so
that
justice
blackmun,
is
a
frequent
case
and
what
is
the
situation
in
the
torpy
case
actually,
where
the
conviction
was
also
contributing.
that
i
am
sure
alerted
the
trial
judge
that
this
person
should
be
considered
for
examination.
i
want
to
emphasize
this,
the
trial
judge
--
the
termination
at
that
point
is
merely
to
have
this
examination
and
then
the
--,
as
i
pointed
out
in
my
brief
in
the
note
1954.
wisconsin
law
review,
you
know
the
statute
had
been
in
operation
only
couple
of
years,
it
was
enacted
in
‘51
--
mr.
george
l.
frederick
yes!
mr.
george
l.
frederick
yes,
‘51
sir.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
we
had
a
statute
on
the
books
your
honor,
from
1947
under
which
there
was
no
commitment.
it
was
a
civil
sexual
psychopath
statute.
so
the
--
mr.
george
l.
frederick
the
examination,
your
honor,
can
be
conducted
at
anyone
of
several
places.
it
can
be
conducted
as
an
outpatient
while
the
man
is
at
large.
he
can
be
sent
to
the
sex
deviate
center
which
up
until
january
the
1st,
1970
was
at
the
state
prison
of
waukon.
he
maybe
examined
at
a
facility
in
milwaukee
county
that
has
been
approved
by
the
state
department
of
health
and
social
services
or
he
can
also
be
examined
at
other
various
sundry
hospitals
that
have
met
the
requirements
--
mr.
george
l.
frederick
yes!
mr.
george
l.
frederick
the
examination.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
yes!
mr.
george
l.
frederick
that
was
the
point,
the
statistics
--
since
our
program
is
been
on
operation
show
about
a
50-50
breakdown
after
the
examination.
about
half
of
the
people
are
determined
to
be
not
in
need
of
treatment
and
not
suffering
form
the
statutory
phrase
aberrations
and
are
disposed
off
under
the
criminal
code,
regular
sentencing
provisions.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
that
is
true!
mr.
george
l.
frederick
then
at
that
point,
your
honor,
there
is
a
triggered
second
round
in
which
the
defendant
has
the
right
to
counsel
again,
his
own
statutory,
his
own
psychiatrist,
not
the
states.
now
all
are
paid
for
by
the
state.
and
they
have
a
hearing
to
determine
if
in
fact
the
recommendation
of
the
department
should
be
followed.
the
burden
is
on
the
state
to
prove
that
by
the
civil
burden
preponderance
of
the
evidence--
mr.
george
l.
frederick
yes!
mr.
george
l.
frederick
judge
takes
this
one.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
that
is
true.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
he
can
put
on
his
own
experts.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
he
does
not
(inaudible).
mr.
george
l.
frederick
your
honor,
what
happened
here
was
he
was
using
his
form
of
the
--,
they
have
a
standard
form
of
the
order
that
he
had
been
using
up
until
that
time.
early
in
january
1967,
the
heubner
case
was
decided
and
that
put
in
this
requirement
for
a
hearing.
and
as
i
said,
all
i
can
do
is
make
the
inference
that
three
months
after
this
decision
came
down,
the
defendant
either
got
a
hearing
or
made
a
satisfactory
waiver
of
his
right
to
the
hearing
and
i
do
not
think
--
mr.
george
l.
frederick
yes.
not
after
it
your
honor.
at
the
time
of
this
appearance
for
commitment
when
the
order
--,
the
first
order.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
that
is
true.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
you
want
me
to
tell
you?
go
outside
of
the
record,
should
i
tell
you?
mr.
george
l.
frederick
i
have
nothing
on
the
record
to
dispute
that.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
we
cannot
deceive
that
much,
the
department
did
recommend
3
months.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
no,
i
can
only
tell
you
what
the
procedure
is
in
the
usual
case
but
i
could
not
swear
that
it
was
followed
in
this
case.
that
is
true,
your
honor.
instantly,
this
statutory
word
that
may
have
troubled
you
at
aberrations
operations
was
a
word
devised
by
the
department
to
make
this
sort
of
distinction,
your
honors.
the
department
of
course
has
been
studying
this
programs,
since
the
end
operation
could
be
one
and
they
gradually
flushed
out
the
criteria,
so
aberrations
means
essentially
this.
those
who
have
sexual
offense
in
the
broad
sense
stands
from
the,
what
should
i
say,
their
environment,
for
example,
it
is
no
secret
that
in
certain
areas
of
wisconsin,
they
incest
between
father
and
daughter,
is
not
such
a
shocking
thing.
as
strangely
enough
those
cases
would
be
not
within
the
purview
of
the
statute
as
the
department
has
interpreted
their
criteria.
what
they
are
trying
to
do
is
to
deal
with
the
individual
whose
own
psychological
make-up
as
best
that
can
be
determined
and
is
imprecise
as
it
is
leads
them
to
commit
sex
offenses.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
there
is
no
record,
your
honor
to
show
what
it
is
–
mr.
george
l.
frederick
yes.
all
i
can
do
is
to
cite
you
to
the
cases
in
my
brief
burby
versus
burke
(ph)
and
if
you
--
mr.
george
l.
frederick
they
have
a
special
review
board
under
this
statute,
your
honor
who
deals
especially
with
this
class
of
persons.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
no
your
honor.
the
question
is
--
mr.
george
l.
frederick
yes!
the
criteria
for
a
release
is
set
out
in
section
97514,
and
it
is
dangerous
to
the
public
because
of
the
person's
mental
or
physical
deficiency
disorder
or
abnormality
and
that
has
been
construed
those
last
three
words
they
relate
back
to
the
aberrations.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
yes!
mr.
george
l.
frederick
that
is
true.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
i
would
not
assume
now
it
is
predicated
your
honor,
on
the
results
of
the
test
that
are
maintained
under
the
statute.
everyone
has
to
be
examined
once
a
year
and
if
he
is
not
examined,
he
goes
before
the
court
again.
when
he
has
been
extended
once
like
this
petitioner,
he
goes
before
the
court
every
six
months
if
he
wishes
for
an
extension.
so
i
would
assume
that
this
petitioner,
like
everybody
else
similarly
situated
was
afforded
the
opportunity
for
treatment
and
the
department
felt
that
the
things
had
progressed
to
the
point
that
he
was
no
longer
dangerous.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
that
is
why
i
feel
like
i
am
operating
here
with
one
hand
type,
like
that.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
we
did
not
resist
it.
what
happened
was
this.
when
this
lady
attorney
did
not
file
the
brief,
the
judge
apprised
the
man
--
mr.
george
l.
frederick
no!
mr.
george
l.
frederick
that
is
true!
mr.
george
l.
frederick
we
did.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
that
is
true.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
there
has
never
been
an
evidentiary
hearing.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
yes,
that
is
what
i
devoted
first
part
of
my
brief
to
and
of
course
i
stand
on
those
positions
but
i
would
not
burden
you
more
than
here
now.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
or
after
--
mr.
george
l.
frederick
no!
no,
your
honor.
it
is,
in
this
case,
when
the
hearing
was
held
at
the
end
of
the
maximum
time,
he
would
have
received
had
he
been
sentenced
under
the
criminal
code.
and
he
was
continued
for
five-years,
then
every
six
months
thereafter,
he
has
a
right
to
have
another
hearing
before
the
court
and
department
must
justify
his
continued
control
by
the
department.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
yes
justice
blackmun,
but
i
should
point
out
this,
you
understand
that
everyone
under
the
sex
crime
was
handled
that
under
the
sex
crimes
law,
has
no
minimum
sentence
so
to
speak.
in
other
words,
if
you
go
to
the
facility
and
they
decide
a
week
later
that
you
are
done,
you
go
out.
either
on
parole
or
final
discharge,
you
can
do
either
one.
and
your
parole
and
your
connection
with
the
department
is
ended
whereas
of
course,
everyone
else
who
goes
to
the
state
prison
is
sent
there
for
a
year
and
must
pay
the
half
the
maximum
before
they
are
eligible
for
the
parole.
if
your
sentenced
for
30
years,
you
still
come
up
for
a
parole
within
a
year
at
the
most
under
wisconsin
law.
incidentally,
this
maximum
period
is
computed
by
like
much
as
they
do
in
federal,
you
take
the
statutory
good
time
and
deduct
it
from
the
maximum
sentence,
so
that
on
a
recharge
of
30
years,
you
would
do
at
most
16
years
and
3
months.
now
--
mr.
george
l.
frederick
of
course,
your
honor
–
mr.
george
l.
frederick
you
have
the
same
right
of
course
as
everybody
does
to
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
i
think
that
here,
it
would
not
be
just
like
the
usual
sentence
where
your
sentence
has
not
expired
yet
because
if
you
could
show
that
you
had
not
been
afforded
treatment
and
so
forth,
the
state
would
be
in
their
election
of
its
duties
under
the
statute
and
the
writ
would
lie
just
as
very
similar
to
the
provision
18
us
c4517.
if
i
could
leave
you
with
one
fraud,
your
honors
and
that
is
this
what
we
have
tried
to
do
here
under
this
sex
crimes
statute
is
to
utilize
psychiatric
data.
even
though
what
is
the
best.
we
can
believe
that
there
could
be
much
worse
in
the
existing
system
of
incarceration
where
you
put
a
man
in
prison
and
lock
him
up
and
leave
him
there.
here,
there
is
an
obligation
on
both
parties,
the
state
to
provide
treatment
and
the
defendant
to
seek
out
treatment
and
i
think
this
is
important
because
experience
has
shown
on
that
this
man
are
often
poorly
motivated
for
treatment
and
here,
they
have
a
definite
incentive
to
be
treated
and
i
think
that
it
is
about
as
good
a
system
as
any
for
dealing
with
this
sort
of
difficult
problem,
much
is
like
faces
us
with
alcoholics
and
drug
addicts
and
so
forth,
where
there
is
no
real
question
of
insanity.
it
is
best
a
personality
dis-function
that
he
has
justified
the
commitment.
the
other
difficult
part
of
this
problem,
your
honor,
is
the
jury
trial
question
and
i
say
it
is
difficult
in
the
sense
that
if
we
require
a
jury
trial
for
these
proceedings,
i
wonder
where
it
is
we
draw
the
line
after
that,
because
there
are
many
statutes
under
which
a
man
is
deprived
of
his
liberty
without
jury
trial.
for
example,
under
wisconsin
statutes,
one
who
has
tuberculosis,
one
who
has
venereal
disease,
one
of
that
has
typhoid
fever.
those
who
do
not
support
their
families
might
be
incarcerated
summarily
for
up
to
six-months,
so
i
think
it
is
a
very
real
question
as
to
what
point
we
are
going
to
extend
the
right
to
jury
trial
in
these
collateral
proceedings
wisconsin
has
never
required
that
under
the
constitution.
it
has
always
been
a
statutory
right
to
have
a
jury
trial
on
insanity
proceeding.
thank
you.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
respondent
here,
warden
cady,
warden
of
wisconsin
state
prison.
perhaps
it
should
be
well
to
begin
by
dealing
with
some
of
the
questions
that
we
are
put
to
mr.
charne.
the
question
on
the
section
as
far
as
discretionary
commitment
is
concerned
is
dealt
within
section
97502,
which
provides
that
if
their
sex
crime
is
defined
there
is
one
in
which
the
desire
for
the
sexual
excitement
existed
in
the
commission
of
the
crime
and
provides
that
the
court
may
take
testimony
after
conviction
if
necessary,
to
determine
that
issue.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
let
me
clarify
that
mr.
chief
justice.
the
way
the
charge
is
booked
is
section
94715,
subsection
1,
subsection
80
which
is
contributing
to
the
delinquency
of
the
child.
the
sex
crimes
act
then
comes
in
to
play
your
honor,
just
as
or
the
closest
analogy
would
be
the
habitual
criminal
statutes
which
we
have
in
wisconsin
section
939.62
where
the
enhanced
punishment
as
a
repeater
comes
into
operation
not
as
an
additional
charge
but
as
an
enhancement
of
punishment
but
there
is
a
separate
finding
and
the
defendant
is
given
notice
before
he
pleads
to
the
offense.
and
of
course,
this
is
our
contention
precisely
that
--
i
have
got
a
stand
here
and
i
cannot
say
anything
outside
the
records
but
it
is
an
inference
i
believe,
your
honor,
from
the
heubner
case
and
the
other
cases
as
i
cite
in
my
brief
such
as
rippon
(ph)
that
the
practice
was
when
this
defendant
entered
his
plea
of
guilty
then
he
was
informed
that
he
might
be
subjected
to
the
disposition
under
the
sex
crimes
act.
now,
the
purpose
for
the
discretionary
element
on
these
crimes
other
than
the
three
mandatory
ones
is
this.
if
you
charge
a
man
with
incest
why
is
necessary
to
take
additional
testimony,
on
that
to
show
that
sexual
excitement
existed
in
the
commission
of
the
crime.
on
the
other
hand,
when
you
charge
a
man
with
contributing
to
the
delinquency
of
a
minor,
then
it
is
after
proposed
to
take
the
testimony
and
--
mr.
george
l.
frederick
in
larceny
of
a
watch,
your
honor
would
be
treated
like
this.
that
would
require
a
separate
hearing
to
show
that
this
particular
individual
was
one
of
the
small
group
that
god
sexual
gratification
from
stealing
the
property
of
others
just
to
some
people
--
mr.
george
l.
frederick
except
that
the
courts
of
wisconsin
supreme
court,
your
honor
has
given
the
--,
what
should
i
say,
a
telegraph
to
prosecutors
and
judges
that
by
the
heubner
decision
that
you
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
stray
too
far-field
on
this.
they
are
going
to
require
some
direct
substantiation
that
the
crime
involved
was
in
fact,
motivated
by
a
desire
for
sexual
gratification.
i
think
as
we
get
further
and
further
in
field.
it
becomes
harder
to
show.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
yes!
mr.
george
l.
frederick
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
i
agree.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
all
right,
your
honor,
now
--
mr.
george
l.
frederick
now,
in
1967,
wisconsin
adopted
the
manifest
injustice
test
for
acceptance
of
the
plea
of
guilty.
at
that
time
of
course,
we
began
to
attempt
to
comply
with
federal
rule
11
and
that
the
trial
judge
had
to
ascertain
that
the
acts
the
person
allegedly
committed
constituted
the
offense.
so
in
the
course
of
adducing
that
information
on
a
guilty
plea,
this
information
might
welcome
to
the
trial
judge’s
attention
or
you
are
quite
correct,
the
district
attorney
could
call
it
to
the
judge's
attention
and
surprisingly
enough
your
honor
defense
attorneys
may
well
call
this
to
the
courts
attention
because
--
mr.
george
l.
frederick
pre-sentence
report
could
and
of
course
on
a
trial
on
the
merits,
then
it
would
become
or
it
might
become
quite
obvious
that
--
mr.
george
l.
frederick
that
is
true.
and
before
the
disposition
under
the
sex
crimes
act
could
be
sustained,
your
honor.
there
would
have
to
be
a
finding
made
on
these
by
the
judge
on
the
record
that
is
the
necessary
sexual
gratification
in
the
connection
with
the
crime
was
present.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
well,
let
me
be
frank
with
you
then,
your
honor
that
the
same
reason
is
why
i
always
charged
the
repeaters
statute
and
the
guys
down
the
hall
in
the
prosecutors
office,
never
did.
it
was
my
right
of
discretion
in
effect
whether
to
charge
a
repeater
or
not.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
none!
mr.
george
l.
frederick
all
our
prosecutor
can
do
in
wisconsin
your
honor
is
to
charge
the
principal
offense.
in
this
case
contributing,
and
then
that
if
and
only
if
the
trial
judge
asked
for
some
recommendation
as
to
disposition
is
the
defendant
likely
to
be
subjected
to
the
act
and
in
wisconsin,
we
have
the
rule
that
the
prosecutors
recommendations
are
not
at
all
binding
on
a
trial
judge.
every
defendant
knows
that,
so
we
have
very
little
justice
in
the
repeaters
statute,
very
seldom
is
the
enhanced
sentence
given.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
no!
it
is
not
automatic
your
honor.
and
what
triggers
it
is,
he
has
a
based
i
think
set
out
from
in
torpy
which
i
cite
in
my
brief.
the
procedure
is
in
wisconsin
as
every
place
else
in
the
union
that
you
often
charge
less
than
the
facts
warrant
and
this
is
a
very
good
clue
that
the
judge
of
course,
if
the
principal
charge
was
in
fact
one
of
the
mandatory
offenses
and
the
prosecutor
moves
to
amend
it
because
he
says,
your
honor
i
feel
that
i
cannot
maintain
my
burden
of
proof.
this
would
be
a
clear
instance
of
when
the
judge
would
be
alerted
to
take
discretionary
action
under
that
provision
97502
of
the
statutes.
so
that
justice
blackmun,
is
a
frequent
case
and
what
is
the
situation
in
the
torpy
case
actually,
where
the
conviction
was
also
contributing.
that
i
am
sure
alerted
the
trial
judge
that
this
person
should
be
considered
for
examination.
i
want
to
emphasize
this,
the
trial
judge
--
the
termination
at
that
point
is
merely
to
have
this
examination
and
then
the
--,
as
i
pointed
out
in
my
brief
in
the
note
1954.
wisconsin
law
review,
you
know
the
statute
had
been
in
operation
only
couple
of
years,
it
was
enacted
in
‘51
--
mr.
george
l.
frederick
yes!
mr.
george
l.
frederick
yes,
‘51
sir.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
we
had
a
statute
on
the
books
your
honor,
from
1947
under
which
there
was
no
commitment.
it
was
a
civil
sexual
psychopath
statute.
so
the
--
mr.
george
l.
frederick
the
examination,
your
honor,
can
be
conducted
at
anyone
of
several
places.
it
can
be
conducted
as
an
outpatient
while
the
man
is
at
large.
he
can
be
sent
to
the
sex
deviate
center
which
up
until
january
the
1st,
1970
was
at
the
state
prison
of
waukon.
he
maybe
examined
at
a
facility
in
milwaukee
county
that
has
been
approved
by
the
state
department
of
health
and
social
services
or
he
can
also
be
examined
at
other
various
sundry
hospitals
that
have
met
the
requirements
--
mr.
george
l.
frederick
yes!
mr.
george
l.
frederick
the
examination.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
yes!
mr.
george
l.
frederick
that
was
the
point,
the
statistics
--
since
our
program
is
been
on
operation
show
about
a
50-50
breakdown
after
the
examination.
about
half
of
the
people
are
determined
to
be
not
in
need
of
treatment
and
not
suffering
form
the
statutory
phrase
aberrations
and
are
disposed
off
under
the
criminal
code,
regular
sentencing
provisions.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
that
is
true!
mr.
george
l.
frederick
then
at
that
point,
your
honor,
there
is
a
triggered
second
round
in
which
the
defendant
has
the
right
to
counsel
again,
his
own
statutory,
his
own
psychiatrist,
not
the
states.
now
all
are
paid
for
by
the
state.
and
they
have
a
hearing
to
determine
if
in
fact
the
recommendation
of
the
department
should
be
followed.
the
burden
is
on
the
state
to
prove
that
by
the
civil
burden
preponderance
of
the
evidence--
mr.
george
l.
frederick
yes!
mr.
george
l.
frederick
judge
takes
this
one.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
that
is
true.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
he
can
put
on
his
own
experts.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
he
does
not
(inaudible).
mr.
george
l.
frederick
your
honor,
what
happened
here
was
he
was
using
his
form
of
the
--,
they
have
a
standard
form
of
the
order
that
he
had
been
using
up
until
that
time.
early
in
january
1967,
the
heubner
case
was
decided
and
that
put
in
this
requirement
for
a
hearing.
and
as
i
said,
all
i
can
do
is
make
the
inference
that
three
months
after
this
decision
came
down,
the
defendant
either
got
a
hearing
or
made
a
satisfactory
waiver
of
his
right
to
the
hearing
and
i
do
not
think
--
mr.
george
l.
frederick
yes.
not
after
it
your
honor.
at
the
time
of
this
appearance
for
commitment
when
the
order
--,
the
first
order.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
that
is
true.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
you
want
me
to
tell
you?
go
outside
of
the
record,
should
i
tell
you?
mr.
george
l.
frederick
i
have
nothing
on
the
record
to
dispute
that.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
we
cannot
deceive
that
much,
the
department
did
recommend
3
months.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
no,
i
can
only
tell
you
what
the
procedure
is
in
the
usual
case
but
i
could
not
swear
that
it
was
followed
in
this
case.
that
is
true,
your
honor.
instantly,
this
statutory
word
that
may
have
troubled
you
at
aberrations
operations
was
a
word
devised
by
the
department
to
make
this
sort
of
distinction,
your
honors.
the
department
of
course
has
been
studying
this
programs,
since
the
end
operation
could
be
one
and
they
gradually
flushed
out
the
criteria,
so
aberrations
means
essentially
this.
those
who
have
sexual
offense
in
the
broad
sense
stands
from
the,
what
should
i
say,
their
environment,
for
example,
it
is
no
secret
that
in
certain
areas
of
wisconsin,
they
incest
between
father
and
daughter,
is
not
such
a
shocking
thing.
as
strangely
enough
those
cases
would
be
not
within
the
purview
of
the
statute
as
the
department
has
interpreted
their
criteria.
what
they
are
trying
to
do
is
to
deal
with
the
individual
whose
own
psychological
make-up
as
best
that
can
be
determined
and
is
imprecise
as
it
is
leads
them
to
commit
sex
offenses.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
there
is
no
record,
your
honor
to
show
what
it
is
–
mr.
george
l.
frederick
yes.
all
i
can
do
is
to
cite
you
to
the
cases
in
my
brief
burby
versus
burke
(ph)
and
if
you
--
mr.
george
l.
frederick
they
have
a
special
review
board
under
this
statute,
your
honor
who
deals
especially
with
this
class
of
persons.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
no
your
honor.
the
question
is
--
mr.
george
l.
frederick
yes!
the
criteria
for
a
release
is
set
out
in
section
97514,
and
it
is
dangerous
to
the
public
because
of
the
person's
mental
or
physical
deficiency
disorder
or
abnormality
and
that
has
been
construed
those
last
three
words
they
relate
back
to
the
aberrations.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
yes!
mr.
george
l.
frederick
that
is
true.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
i
would
not
assume
now
it
is
predicated
your
honor,
on
the
results
of
the
test
that
are
maintained
under
the
statute.
everyone
has
to
be
examined
once
a
year
and
if
he
is
not
examined,
he
goes
before
the
court
again.
when
he
has
been
extended
once
like
this
petitioner,
he
goes
before
the
court
every
six
months
if
he
wishes
for
an
extension.
so
i
would
assume
that
this
petitioner,
like
everybody
else
similarly
situated
was
afforded
the
opportunity
for
treatment
and
the
department
felt
that
the
things
had
progressed
to
the
point
that
he
was
no
longer
dangerous.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
that
is
why
i
feel
like
i
am
operating
here
with
one
hand
type,
like
that.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
we
did
not
resist
it.
what
happened
was
this.
when
this
lady
attorney
did
not
file
the
brief,
the
judge
apprised
the
man
--
mr.
george
l.
frederick
no!
mr.
george
l.
frederick
that
is
true!
mr.
george
l.
frederick
we
did.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
that
is
true.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
there
has
never
been
an
evidentiary
hearing.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
yes,
that
is
what
i
devoted
first
part
of
my
brief
to
and
of
course
i
stand
on
those
positions
but
i
would
not
burden
you
more
than
here
now.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
or
after
--
mr.
george
l.
frederick
no!
no,
your
honor.
it
is,
in
this
case,
when
the
hearing
was
held
at
the
end
of
the
maximum
time,
he
would
have
received
had
he
been
sentenced
under
the
criminal
code.
and
he
was
continued
for
five-years,
then
every
six
months
thereafter,
he
has
a
right
to
have
another
hearing
before
the
court
and
department
must
justify
his
continued
control
by
the
department.
mr.
george
l.
frederick
yes
justice
blackmun,
but
i
should
point
out
this,
you
understand
that
everyone
under
the
sex
crime
was
handled
that
under
the
sex
crimes
law,
has
no
minimum
sentence
so
to
speak.
in
other
words,
if
you
go
to
the
facility
and
they
decide
a
week
later
that
you
are
done,
you
go
out.
either
on
parole
or
final
discharge,
you
can
do
either
one.
and
your
parole
and
your
connection
with
the
department
is
ended
whereas
of
course,
everyone
else
who
goes
to
the
state
prison
is
sent
there
for
a
year
and
must
pay
the
half
the
maximum
before
they
are
eligible
for
the
parole.
if
your
sentenced
for
30
years,
you
still
come
up
for
a
parole
within
a
year
at
the
most
under
wisconsin
law.
incidentally,
this
maximum
period
is
computed
by
like
much
as
they
do
in
federal,
you
take
the
statutory
good
time
and
deduct
it
from
the
maximum
sentence,
so
that
on
a
recharge
of
30
years,
you
would
do
at
most
16
years
and
3
months.
now
--
mr.
george
l.
frederick
of
course,
your
honor
–
mr.
george
l.
frederick
you
have
the
same
right
of
course
as
everybody
does
to
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
i
think
that
here,
it
would
not
be
just
like
the
usual
sentence
where
your
sentence
has
not
expired
yet
because
if
you
could
show
that
you
had
not
been
afforded
treatment
and
so
forth,
the
state
would
be
in
their
election
of
its
duties
under
the
statute
and
the
writ
would
lie
just
as
very
similar
to
the
provision
18
us
c4517.
if
i
could
leave
you
with
one
fraud,
your
honors
and
that
is
this
what
we
have
tried
to
do
here
under
this
sex
crimes
statute
is
to
utilize
psychiatric
data.
even
though
what
is
the
best.
we
can
believe
that
there
could
be
much
worse
in
the
existing
system
of
incarceration
where
you
put
a
man
in
prison
and
lock
him
up
and
leave
him
there.
here,
there
is
an
obligation
on
both
parties,
the
state
to
provide
treatment
and
the
defendant
to
seek
out
treatment
and
i
think
this
is
important
because
experience
has
shown
on
that
this
man
are
often
poorly
motivated
for
treatment
and
here,
they
have
a
definite
incentive
to
be
treated
and
i
think
that
it
is
about
as
good
a
system
as
any
for
dealing
with
this
sort
of
difficult
problem,
much
is
like
faces
us
with
alcoholics
and
drug
addicts
and
so
forth,
where
there
is
no
real
question
of
insanity.
it
is
best
a
personality
dis-function
that
he
has
justified
the
commitment.
the
other
difficult
part
of
this
problem,
your
honor,
is
the
jury
trial
question
and
i
say
it
is
difficult
in
the
sense
that
if
we
require
a
jury
trial
for
these
proceedings,
i
wonder
where
it
is
we
draw
the
line
after
that,
because
there
are
many
statutes
under
which
a
man
is
deprived
of
his
liberty
without
jury
trial.
for
example,
under
wisconsin
statutes,
one
who
has
tuberculosis,
one
who
has
venereal
disease,
one
of
that
has
typhoid
fever.
those
who
do
not
support
their
families
might
be
incarcerated
summarily
for
up
to
six-months,
so
i
think
it
is
a
very
real
question
as
to
what
point
we
are
going
to
extend
the
right
to
jury
trial
in
these
collateral
proceedings
wisconsin
has
never
required
that
under
the
constitution.
it
has
always
been
a
statutory
right
to
have
a
jury
trial
on
insanity
proceeding.
thank
you.
