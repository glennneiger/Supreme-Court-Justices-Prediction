mr.
irvin
b.
charne
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
and
i
represent
the
petitioner
donald
yogurt
humphrey
who
presented
as
the
court
knows
his
hand
written
petition
to
this
court
without
the
benefit
of
counsel.
mr.
humphrey’s
case,
commenced
--
started
back
in
may
of
1967.
on
may
30
of
1967,
he
was
arrested
in
the
state
of
wisconsin
waukesha
county
which
is
a
county
adjacent
to
milwaukee
county
and
charged
with
the
offense
of
contributing
to
the
delinquency
of
a
child.
this
is
a
misdemeanor
in
the
state
of
wisconsin
caring
a
maximum
penalty
of
one
year.
we
do
not
have
the
record,
your
honor
of
that
initial
proceeding
here.
however,
in
his
petition
to
this
court
for
writ
of
certiorari
mr.
humphrey
said,
he
was
sitting
in
a
car
and
drinking
beer
with
the
boy
who
was
almost
14
years,
he
was
13
at
that
time.
and
this
is--,
i
think
over
in
wisconsin,
a
very
frequent
type
of
case
that
contributing
to
the
delinquency
of
a
minor.
it
is
against
the
law
for
a
minor
to
drink
beer
and
if
an
adult
gives
him
an
alcoholic
beverage,
you
are
then
contributing
to
delinquency
of
a
minor.
so
that
is
apparently
the
offense
for
which
he
was
arrested.
may
30,
1967,
the
next
day,
may
31,
1967
he
was
in
court.
he
pleaded
guilty
to
the
offense
and
the
court
under
the
wisconsin
sex
crimes
act
committed
him
for
a
pre-sentence
examination.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
no,
your
honor.
it
was
for
contributing
to
the
delinquency
of
the
child.
now
then,
we
--.
pardon
me,
yes
sir.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
well,
your
honor,
i
will
explain
what
the
wisconsin
sex
crimes
act
covers.
in
wisconsin
under
our
sex
crimes
act,
there
are
two
categories
of
sex
crimes.
one
category
is
that
which
calls
for
a
mandatory
sentence
under
the
sex
crimes
act
and
that
includes
the
offenses
of
rape,
attempted
rape,
sexual
intercourse
without
consent
and
indecent
liberties
with
a
child.
if
you
are
convicted
of
those,
you
automatically
go
in
the
system.
however,
the
wisconsin
statute
provides
that
any
other
offense
except
homicide
or
attempted
homicide
can
also
be
a
sex
crime,
it
is
a
sex
crime,
if
the
court
finds
that
the
defendant
was
probably,
directly
motivated
by
a
desire
for
sexual
excitement
in
the
commission
of
the
crime,
if
the
court
finds
--
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes,
your
honor
or
sneaking
in
to
an
x-rated
movie.
if
the
court
finds
that
the
defendant
was
probably,
directly
motivated
by
a
desire
for
sexual
excitement
in
the
commission
of
the
crime,
this
becomes
a
sex
crime
in
the
state
of
wisconsin.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
well,
this
is
one
of
our
complaints,
your
honor
because
i
do
not
think
that
the
statute
requires
any
evidence.
it
does
not
require
assuring
on
that
issue
and
we
do
not
have
a
record
as
to
what
happened
but
we
do
have
a
record.
what
is
in
the
record
shows
that
this
man
was
arrested
may
30th?
he
was
convicted
on
his
plea
of
guilty
to
the
crime
of
contributing
to
the
trial
on
may
31st
and
sent
away,
for
a
pre-sentence
examination
under
the
sex
crimes
act.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
well,
in
his
petition
to
this
court,
your
honor
he
says
that,
that
is
all
that
was
going
on,
he
says
that
he
and
the
boy
were
put
under
considerable
pressure
to
testify
of
something
else,
but
both
of
them
denied
it.
he
also
says
the
boy
was
sent
to
a
hospital
for
a
medical
examination
and
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
sexual
molestation.
so
it
is
unfortunately,
that
we
do
not
have
that
record
but
that
is
what
the
evidence
is
now.
we
do
have
the
court's
order
of
commitment
which
does
not
indicate
any
hearing
on
that
particular
issue.
he
was
sent
away
on
may
31st
and
on
july
24th,
the
report
came
back
from
the
department
that
had
examined
him
and
that
is
found
the
orders
in
the
court
--
entered
an
order
which
is
found
on
the
appendix
on
page
11,
that
is
part
of
the
record
and
the
court
says
nothing
about
the
basis
of
its
finding
that
this
was
a
sex
crime,
it
says
that
he
was
sent
away
and
the
report
of
the
department
came
in
and
based
upon
that
report
he
sentences
him
under
the
wisconsin
sex
crimes
act.
he
was
sent
to
walk
on
state
prison
which
at
that
time
was
the
facility
designated
for
a
sex
crimes
act
people.
it
was
not
a
hassle
to
walk
on
a
state
prison.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
no,
we
do
not
have
the
report,
your
honor
it
is
not
in
the
record.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
i
believe
that,
yes!
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes
sir.
and
that
the
judge
says
that
in
his
order
and
incidentally
the
order
of
the
judge
also
indicates
that
on
the
day
when
he
was
sent
away,
that
there
was
no
attorney
present,
says
that
the
report
came
back
on
july
24th
and
the
appearances
were
the
state
of
wisconsin
appearing
by
robert
evans,
assistant
attorney
--,
district
attorney
for
waukesha
county
and
the
defendant
appearing
in
person.
so
that
on
that
day,
when
he
commenced
his
sentence
under
the
sex
crimes
act
apparently,
there
was
not
even
a
hearing
on
that
day.
now
then
he
went
–
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
now,
the
sentence
under
the
sex
crimes
act
is
an
indefinite
period
of
time
in
these
segments.
first,
you
go
for
the
maximum
period
for
which
you
could
have
been
sentenced.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes,
under
the
offense.
then
the
department,
if
it
believes
that
you
are
danger.
if
there
is
danger
to
the
public
from
releasing
you,
orders
you
extend
it
and
that
order
is
subject
to
review
of
a
court
and
they
can
extend
you
in
five-year
increments
without
limits.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
at
the
end
of
one-year
or
a
little
less
than
the
year,
in
april
of
1968,
under
which
he
had
been
sent
away,
july
24th
of
’67
and
april
of
1968,
the
department
issued
its
order
saying
that
this
could
be
extended
for
another
five-year
period.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes!
then
the
department
applied
to
the
county
court
of
waukesha
county
to
confirm
that
orders.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
and
goes
it
back
before
the
same
judge
but
it
turned
out
the
judge
was
not
there
and
someone
else
was
filling
in
for
him,
so
another
judge
then
heard
the
matter
and
there
was
a
hearing
on
july
23
of
1968,
on
the
order
of
the
department
to
extend
him.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes,
he
had
the
lady
lawyer
on
july
23.
mrs.
naft(ph)
who
--
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes,
he
did
your
honor.
he
had
counsel
and
he
pleaded
guilty,
through
the
original
offense
and
it
does
not,
the
record
does
not
indicate
why
that
counsel
was
not
called
at
the
time
he
was
actually
sentenced.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
if
there
was
a
hearing,
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
that
is
correct
your
honor.
according
to
the
order
of
the
court,
that
is
the
only
record
we
have,
that
is
the
court's
order
and
it
does
not
recite
the
presence
of
any
counsel
for
him.
it
says
that
the
defendant
appearing
in
person.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes
your
honor.
he
was
extended
for
five
years
which
would
have
made
it
1973.
however,
he
was
paroled
this
year
earlier,
in
march
of
this
year,
he
was
paroled.
so
at
the
present
time,
he
is
on
parole.
at
the
time
when
he
was
brought
back
for
this
hearing
to
confirm
the
extension
order
of
five
years,
he
was
there
represented
by
mrs.
naft.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
oh,
yes!
it
is
very
clear.
he
could
spend
the
rest
of
his
life.
there
is
no
time
limit
except
that
there
are
five
year
increments
and
it
must
be
confirmed
by
a
court.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes.
that
is
right!
that
in
the
opinion
of
the
department
his
release
would
be
dangerous
to
the
public.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
i
believe
that
he
is,
your
honor.
i
know
that
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
has
said
he
should
be.
there
was
a
case
in
wisconsin
huebner
case
which
the
court
set
out
the
procedural
requirements
and
clearly
indicated
that
person
is
entitled
to
counsel
and
it
should
be
represented
by
counsel.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
well,
they
talk
about
dangerous
in
this
your
honor
but
they
have
not
really
--,
i
think
explained
what
dangerous
means
other
than
it
does
not
necessarily
mean
physical
harm.
they
point
it
--
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
i
do
not
believe
so
your
honor.
i
do
not
believe
that
it
is
limited,
the
statute
certainly
does
not
say
that
and
i
am
not
aware
of
any
wisconsin
cases.
it
says
it
must
be
limited
to
sexual
problems.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
no,
at
the
time
when
he
was
sent
there,
wisconsin
had
no
separate
facility,
to
sexual
deviates.
the
appendix
to
the
respondents
brief
here
points
of
one
of
the
problems
in
wisconsin
of
getting
money
to
build
an
appropriate
facility.
they
did
not
have
it
and
they
–
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
well,
it
is
questionable
with
the
case
history
in
wisconsin
would
indicate
that
some
of
these
people
had
group
therapy.
and
that
was
considered
sufficient
treatment.
now
that
this
question
of
treatment
for
--
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes
sir.
it
is
prison,
it
was
the
state
prison
and
according
to
--
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
i
do
not
know
your
honor.
i
know
that
mr.
humphrey
was
paroled.
he
is
on
the
parole
at
the
present
time
so
apparently
they
thought
it
was
all
right
to
release
him.
now,
whether
they
were
tried
exercise
continued
to
control,
when
his
time
was
up
i
do
not
know.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes.
it
is
an
extension
of
five
year.
in
five
year
increments.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
no,
i
would
not
say
that
is
correct
your
honor.
apparently,
either
if
the
institutionalisation
itself
or
the
group
therapy
sessions
that
are
held.
for
some
reason,
persuades
the
official
that
as
to
this
man
for
example,
they
could
release
him.
so
in
their
mind,
something
happened
whether
it
actually,
whether
there
is
a
difference
or
not.
i
am
sure
that
mr.
humphrey
would
not
agree
that
he
received
any
treatment.
i
think
in
his
papers
that
he
filed
in
this
and
the
lower
court
–
(voice
overlap)
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
that
is
right
your
honor.
i
am
sure
that
is
true.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
no!
i
know
that
if
he
has
parole
conditions,
suppose
--
i
know
of
the
case,
where
a
man
was
found
drunk
and
driving.
now,
you
are
not
suppose
to
drink
when
you
are
on
parole
and
if
you
are
found
drunk
that
is
the
time
--
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
that
is
my
understanding
your
honor,
yes!
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
i
believe
there
are
some
psychiatrists
on
the
staff
and
also
some
psychologist,
social
workers
on
the
staff
that
are
there
and
wisconsin
now
has
recognized
the
need
for
additional
treatment.
i
think
as
the
respondent's
brief
indicates
commencing
in
this
year,
in
1970,
people
are
now
being
committed
to
what
is
called
the
central
state
hospital
which
is
an
institution
for
the
criminally
insane
in
wisconsin.
that
is
a
change
and
the
wisconsin
department
recognizes
the
need
for
a
special
institution
for
these
types
of
offenses
but
they
do
not
have
it
yet.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes,
it
does.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
that
is
it!
there
was
a
place
where
this
man
was
sent
--
was
the
maximum
security
institution
of
the
state
of
wisconsin.
with
the
walk
on
prison
is
the
place
where
appellants
go.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
i
do
not
know
your
honor.
i
know
that
the
recommendations
were
that
those
people
who
were
in
waukon
at
the
time
that
they
transferred
the
new
commencements
went
to
the
central
state
hospital
but
they
said
that
those
who
had
started
in
one
place
would
continue
there.
now,
i
do
not
know
what
would
happen
to
him
if
he
was
sent
back,
where
he
would
be
sent?
i
believe
that
that
is
an
administrative
function
by
the
department.
i
think,
i
had
gotten
in
my
chronology
to
the
point
where
the
department
had
asked
to
extend
him
for
five
years
and
it
came
up
for
a
hearing
and
he
was
then
represented
by
mrs.
naft
who
was
appointed
by
the
court
representative.
i
think
being
indigent
at
that
time.
mrs.
naft
advised
him
that
he
should
not
cooperate
with
court
appointed
psychiatrists
who
were
present
in
court
on
the
day
of
the
hearing
and
said
she
intended
to
raise
the
constitutional
issues.
the
court
ask
for
her
to
file
brief
sentence
and
that
was
agreed
a
brief
in
schedule
were
set
up
and
then
apparently
nothing
further
was
heard
from
mrs.
naft.
the
court
record
indicates
that
the
judge
wrote
a
letter
to
her
and
said
if
we
do
not
hear
from
you
we
are
going
to
conform
this
order
and
then
the
next
happened
is,
in
november
the
order
was
entered.
november
20,
1968,
judge
björk
who
was
the
substitute
judge
signed
an
order,
confirming
the
extension
for
five
years
and
in
his
order
which
is
found
in
the
appendix
on
page
14,
he
recites
the
fact
he
had
expected
to
get
briefs.
and
he
says
the
matter
having
been
adjourned
for
the
purpose
of
filing
briefs
to
support
their
respective
positions
to
the
state
in
the
defendant
and
no
briefs
having
been
filed
and
the
court
having
directed
correspondents
to
mrs.
naft
dated
october
15,
1968,
advising
mrs.
naft
smith
that
the
absence
of
the
filing
of
briefs
and
any
affirmative
acts
for
and
on
behalf
of
the
defendant
with
regard
to
this
matter,
the
court
would
presume
that
the
defendant
did
not
intent
to
offer
any
proof
as
to
its
condition
and
the
order
would
stand
and
accordingly,
he
confirmed
the
orders.
so
here
you
have
a
man
represented
by
an
attorney
who
did
not
do
anything
at
the
hearing,
no
cross
examine,
they
were
no
witnesses
presented
as
to
the
state
position
and
then
she
set
on,
i
am
going
to
argue
this
on
a
constitutional
basis
and
she
did
not
file
any
brief.
so
it
is
our
position
that-that
type
of
representation
is
equal
to
nothing.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
no!
i
do
not,
your
honor
because
i
think
that
that
--
there
maybe
a
basis
let
us
say,
it
is
up
to
the
state
to
show
this
man’s
condition.
and
this,
according
to
the
state
order,
they
claim
that
they
had
had
a
previous
psychiatric
examination
of
him,
they
see
it
on
the
records
and
files
based
on
his
commitment,
they
believe
he
is
dangerous.
so
i
think
that
they
could
come
into
court
based
upon
what
they
have
and
show
to
the
judge,
here
is
the
reason
that
we
think
this
man
should
be
continued
and
it
is
not
incumbent
upon
the
defendant
to
come
into
court
on
the
day
of
the
hearing
that
two
strange
doctors
brought
in
by
the
judge
and
expect
the
doctors
to
do
a
good
examination
in
a
short
period
of
time
while
you
are
waiting
for
this
case
to
be
heard.
and
i
say
that
i
do
not
think
that
the
man
has
the
right
to
have
his
own
psychiatrist
come
in
under
the
statute.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
the
record
really
does
not
indicate.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
statute
says
that.
the
statute
says
that
he
is
entitled
to
it.
i
am
not
sure
that
he
asked
for
that,
but
the
record
says
that
there
were
two
doctors
there
who
had
been
appointed
by
the
court.
why
they
were
there
does
not
appear
and
who
they
are
represented
does
not
appear.
and
in
any
event,
he
did
not
see
them.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
it
says
that
the
judge
should
appoint
psychiatrist
that
the
man
has
the
right
to
be
examined
by
a
psychiatrist
of
his
choice
and
that
the
court
will
--
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
no!
i
do
not
think
it
does,
your
honor.
i
do
not
know
what
is
the
basis
of
having
these
two
doctors
there
was.
unless
there
was
something
in
the
record
that
we
do
not
have
it,
in
case
somebody
asked
for
him.
i
do
not
know
what
they
were
doing
there.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes
sir!
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes!
he
did
not
ask
to
have
the
judge
appoint
a
doctor
for
him.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes!
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
i
think
the
line,
would
refuse
to
cooperate
is
the
judicial
language
act,
when
you
are
asking
me,
you
honor
whether
i
consider
that
to
be
court
advise
or
whether
i
would
base
my
charge
of
lack
of
adequate
representation
on
that.
i
would
not
say
that,
that
was
because
i
am
not
sure
that
the
lawyer
was
improper
in
directing
him
not
to
have
a
previous
examination.
i
do
not
know
what
the
result
of
that
would
have
been.
i
am
not
claiming
that,
that
is
the
kind
of
error.
in
any
event,
he
was
extended
for
five
years
and
then
after
that
extension,
he
then
commenced
the
series
of
procedures
which
has
brought
him
here.
he
applied
to
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
in
october
of
1969,
he
filed
a
petition,
there
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
it
was
denied.
he
was
without
counsel,
it
was
denied
without
hearing
and
without
even
asking
for
response
and
then
he
went
to
the
united
states
district
court
and
finally,
we
got
him
out
of
this
court.
now,
what
are
the
points
that
we
wish
to
phrase
with
you
regards
to
his
treatment,
i
think.
the
first
thing,
i
want
to
point
out
is
the
difference
or
the
disparity
between
the
treatment
of
man
under
the
wisconsin
sex
crimes
act
and
especially,
i
say
those
which
are
not
the
mandatory,
not
rape,
that
thing
but
any
other
crime
where
the
judge
find
that
maybe
sexually
motivated.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
no,
he
did
not
have
a
hearing
your
honor.
there
was
a
response
filed
by
the
state
whether
it
was
denied
without
a
hearing.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes
your
honor.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
no
your
honor.
this
case
is
very
peculiar
posture.
the
trial
courts
denied
him
a
certificate
of
probable
cause,
so
he
could
not
appeal.
then
he
filed
an
application
for
certificate
of
probable
cause
to
the
court
of
appeals
with
seventh
circuit
and
that
was
denied.
and
then
he
filed
the
petition
with
this
court
and
it
was
granted,
so
that
this
court
has
never
been
heard
by
them,
this
case
is
not
been
heard
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
there
was
no
hearing
in
the
district
court.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
well,
it
is
partly,
that
it
is
my
feeling
that
the
wisconsin
statute
on
its
face
which
i
think
we
can
look
at
without
going
into
the
factual
things,
is
improper,
is
unconstitutional.
and
that
the
wisconsin’s
supreme
court
has
so
interpreted
that
statute
as
to
be
in
conflict
with
this
court's
decision
with
the
baxstrom
case.
in
the
baxstrom
case
which
was
the
case
in
new
york
where
you
had
a
person
who
had
been
sentenced
on
an
assault
charge.
i
think
it
was
a
second
degree
assault.
so
certainly,
you
have
some
question
of
physical
danger
there.
a
man
was
sentenced
i
think
it
is
about
two
and-a-half
years
and
toward
the
end
of
his
sentence,
they
filed
a
petition
saying
this
man
is
insane.
it
requires
his
mental
treatment.
so
then
there
was
a
proceeding
and
he
was
committed
to
an
effect
a
criminal
type
facility
for
treatment
and
it
came
to
this
court
and
this
court
compared
that
treatment
that
he
got
with
what
a
person
under
a
civil
commitment
was
entitled
to
in
the
state
of
new
york
and
said
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
because
that
person
should
have
been
entitled
to
his
same
treatment
a
person
civilly
committed
guy.
now,
i
think
that
is
very
applicable
to
the
state
of
wisconsin.
here
we
have
a
person
who
our
man,
he
get
sentenced
on
a
crime
contributing
to
the
delinquency
of
a
child
and
then
at
the
end
of
one
year
which
is
the
maximum
for
which
he
can
be
sentenced,
he
is
again
committed.
now,
there
is
a
great
difference
between
that
and
what
would
happen
if
he
were
civilly
committed
because
he
is
not
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
and
under
the
wisconsin
mental
health
act
which
we
set
forth,
every
person
in
wisconsin
who
is
convicted
civilly
is
entitled
to
have
that
question
determined
by
a
jury.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
under
the
mental
health
act,
he
would
be
committed
if
he
were
mentally
ill,
infirm
or
deficient.
mentally
ill,
it
means
a
mental
disease
requiring
care
for
the
welfare
for
yourself
or
other
community.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes,
i
think
it
might
include
in.
now,
the
wisconsin
--
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes,
we
would,
your
honor.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes!
he
is
entitled
to
reexamination
under
both
the
mental
health
act
and
sex
crimes
act
but
even
there,
there
is
a
difference.
under
the
sex
crimes
act,
you
are
not
entitled
--
ask
for
a
reexamination
until
you
have
served
the
maximum
period
for
which
under
the
crime.
in
other
words
in
our
brief,
we
say
if
you
are
sentence
for
rape
for
example,
under
the
sex
crimes
act
that
is
a
30
years
maximum.
you
cannot
ask
for
reexamination
on
your
mental
condition
for
30
years.
now,
under
the
mental
health
act
in
wisconsin,
when
you
are
committed,
you
can
ask
for
a
reexamination
at
any
time
after
recommitment
and
you
got
a
hearing
and
a
jury
and
then
you
can
ask
for
reexamination
but
you
cannot
require
it,
more
frequently
than
once
a
year.
now
under
the
sex
crimes
act,
you
have
to
wait
before
they
serve
the
maximum
and
then
you
can
ask
for
a
reexamination
and
after
examination,
you
do
not
get
a
jury
trial.
in
addition
--
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes
your
honor.
on
the
criminal
charge,
no
question,
he
would
be
entitled
for
a
jury
trial.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes
your
honor.
the
thing
the
jury
though
would
not
pass
upon
the
question
of
whether
the
offense
was
sexually
motivated.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
this
is
something
which
the
judge
adds
onto
the
criminal
proceeding,
where
you
have
a
criminal
charge
levied
against
you,
the
issues
are
“did
you
commit
that
offense?”
here
the
answer
is
“yes!”
i
gave
beer
to
a
minor,
i
am
guilty.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
so
then
you
have
the
question
of
exposing
him
to
this
new
--
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
it
is
not,
it
is
in
the
sentence
that
is
in
part
of
it.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes!
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
i
do
not
know,
your
honor.
i
know
it
was
one
of
the
early
statutes
--
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes!
it
is
a
long
standing.
your
honor,
in
connection
with
that,
i
am
sorry
that
i
did
not
get
a
hold
of
this
until
just
a
few
days
ago.
this
is
an
excellent
book,
'the
mentally
disabled
and
the
law,'
which
is
published
by
the
american
law
foundation
in
chicago
university
of
chicago
press
and
has
a
very
good
discussion
of
this
whole
area,
i
would
cited
it
more
sensibly
in
my
brief.
i
had
known
about
it
but
i
just
got
hold
of
it.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
i
appreciate
doing
that.
i
think
your
honor
if
i
have
few
minutes,
i
will
reserve
them.
thank
you.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
i
am
just
going
to
respond
briefly
to
the
question
of
what
triggers
this
proceeding
because
my
belief
and
understanding
is
that
nothing
may
trigger
it
other
than
the
judge's
own
intuition
or
prior
knowledge
of
this
person
or
the
fact
that
the
community
is
presently
angry
about
a
certain
type
thing,
so
the
statute
does
not
require
any
basis
and
i
say
the
statute
does
not
require
a
hearing
on
the
question
of
whether
the
person
is
sexually
motivated
and
this
record
does
not
show
any
such
hearing.
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
in
the
buchanan
case,
that
we
cite,
i
say
has
laid
down
--
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
of
course,
your
honor.
yes,
no
question
about
that
and
i
--,
that
is
very
difficult
for
the
district
court.
your
honor,
i
was
in
the
law
court
and
federal
district
court,
know
how
hard
is
to
examine
all
these
things
and
pick
out
the
good
ones
and
there
was
no
lawyer
who
examine
it
and
the
judge
upon
the
issue
that
the
petitioner
himself
set
forth
the
judges
thought
that
this
was
not
a
meritorious
case.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
that
would
be
very
much
easier.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes,
he
is
your
honor.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
judge,
i
do
not
really
know
the
answer
to
that
and
i
believe
there
is
a
big
chance
that
he
goes
back
to
prison.
and
even
--
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
i
do
not
know.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
they
say
that
he
would
go
to
the
state
central
hospital.
your
honor,
which
is
a
institution
for
the
criminally
insane.
it
is
a
penal
mental
mental
institution.
it
is
not
where
people
go
on
sooner.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes,
he
was.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes,
the
people.
yes,
i
think
we
point
it
on
our
brief
that
a
person
who
is
civilly
committed;
there
is
no
provision
for
sending
him
to
that
institution.
he
may
go
to
a
hospital
if
he
is
civilly
committed.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
well,
i
think
that
maybe
true
although
in
the
case
of
jones
v.
cunningham
i
think
we
cite,
where
there
was
a
young
man
was
on
the
parole.
it
was
pointed
out
the
fact
that
he
is
on
the
parole,
we
are
not
making
the
case
moot
and
i
think
really
here,
the
respondents
is
the
state
of
wisconsin.
the
attorney
general,
the
supreme
court
of
state
of
wisconsin,
the
whole
prison
system
and
the
welfare
is
under
one
direction,
so
he
is
(inaudible).
it
arises
from
the
fact
that
he
was
paroled
in
march
of
this
and
the
writ
was
granted
in
march
also.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes!
oh
yes!
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
the
petition
has
been
filed
last
year.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
thank
you
very
much.
it
has
been
a
honor
to
be
here.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
and
i
represent
the
petitioner
donald
yogurt
humphrey
who
presented
as
the
court
knows
his
hand
written
petition
to
this
court
without
the
benefit
of
counsel.
mr.
humphrey’s
case,
commenced
--
started
back
in
may
of
1967.
on
may
30
of
1967,
he
was
arrested
in
the
state
of
wisconsin
waukesha
county
which
is
a
county
adjacent
to
milwaukee
county
and
charged
with
the
offense
of
contributing
to
the
delinquency
of
a
child.
this
is
a
misdemeanor
in
the
state
of
wisconsin
caring
a
maximum
penalty
of
one
year.
we
do
not
have
the
record,
your
honor
of
that
initial
proceeding
here.
however,
in
his
petition
to
this
court
for
writ
of
certiorari
mr.
humphrey
said,
he
was
sitting
in
a
car
and
drinking
beer
with
the
boy
who
was
almost
14
years,
he
was
13
at
that
time.
and
this
is--,
i
think
over
in
wisconsin,
a
very
frequent
type
of
case
that
contributing
to
the
delinquency
of
a
minor.
it
is
against
the
law
for
a
minor
to
drink
beer
and
if
an
adult
gives
him
an
alcoholic
beverage,
you
are
then
contributing
to
delinquency
of
a
minor.
so
that
is
apparently
the
offense
for
which
he
was
arrested.
may
30,
1967,
the
next
day,
may
31,
1967
he
was
in
court.
he
pleaded
guilty
to
the
offense
and
the
court
under
the
wisconsin
sex
crimes
act
committed
him
for
a
pre-sentence
examination.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
no,
your
honor.
it
was
for
contributing
to
the
delinquency
of
the
child.
now
then,
we
--.
pardon
me,
yes
sir.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
well,
your
honor,
i
will
explain
what
the
wisconsin
sex
crimes
act
covers.
in
wisconsin
under
our
sex
crimes
act,
there
are
two
categories
of
sex
crimes.
one
category
is
that
which
calls
for
a
mandatory
sentence
under
the
sex
crimes
act
and
that
includes
the
offenses
of
rape,
attempted
rape,
sexual
intercourse
without
consent
and
indecent
liberties
with
a
child.
if
you
are
convicted
of
those,
you
automatically
go
in
the
system.
however,
the
wisconsin
statute
provides
that
any
other
offense
except
homicide
or
attempted
homicide
can
also
be
a
sex
crime,
it
is
a
sex
crime,
if
the
court
finds
that
the
defendant
was
probably,
directly
motivated
by
a
desire
for
sexual
excitement
in
the
commission
of
the
crime,
if
the
court
finds
--
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes,
your
honor
or
sneaking
in
to
an
x-rated
movie.
if
the
court
finds
that
the
defendant
was
probably,
directly
motivated
by
a
desire
for
sexual
excitement
in
the
commission
of
the
crime,
this
becomes
a
sex
crime
in
the
state
of
wisconsin.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
well,
this
is
one
of
our
complaints,
your
honor
because
i
do
not
think
that
the
statute
requires
any
evidence.
it
does
not
require
assuring
on
that
issue
and
we
do
not
have
a
record
as
to
what
happened
but
we
do
have
a
record.
what
is
in
the
record
shows
that
this
man
was
arrested
may
30th?
he
was
convicted
on
his
plea
of
guilty
to
the
crime
of
contributing
to
the
trial
on
may
31st
and
sent
away,
for
a
pre-sentence
examination
under
the
sex
crimes
act.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
well,
in
his
petition
to
this
court,
your
honor
he
says
that,
that
is
all
that
was
going
on,
he
says
that
he
and
the
boy
were
put
under
considerable
pressure
to
testify
of
something
else,
but
both
of
them
denied
it.
he
also
says
the
boy
was
sent
to
a
hospital
for
a
medical
examination
and
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
sexual
molestation.
so
it
is
unfortunately,
that
we
do
not
have
that
record
but
that
is
what
the
evidence
is
now.
we
do
have
the
court's
order
of
commitment
which
does
not
indicate
any
hearing
on
that
particular
issue.
he
was
sent
away
on
may
31st
and
on
july
24th,
the
report
came
back
from
the
department
that
had
examined
him
and
that
is
found
the
orders
in
the
court
--
entered
an
order
which
is
found
on
the
appendix
on
page
11,
that
is
part
of
the
record
and
the
court
says
nothing
about
the
basis
of
its
finding
that
this
was
a
sex
crime,
it
says
that
he
was
sent
away
and
the
report
of
the
department
came
in
and
based
upon
that
report
he
sentences
him
under
the
wisconsin
sex
crimes
act.
he
was
sent
to
walk
on
state
prison
which
at
that
time
was
the
facility
designated
for
a
sex
crimes
act
people.
it
was
not
a
hassle
to
walk
on
a
state
prison.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
no,
we
do
not
have
the
report,
your
honor
it
is
not
in
the
record.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
i
believe
that,
yes!
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes
sir.
and
that
the
judge
says
that
in
his
order
and
incidentally
the
order
of
the
judge
also
indicates
that
on
the
day
when
he
was
sent
away,
that
there
was
no
attorney
present,
says
that
the
report
came
back
on
july
24th
and
the
appearances
were
the
state
of
wisconsin
appearing
by
robert
evans,
assistant
attorney
--,
district
attorney
for
waukesha
county
and
the
defendant
appearing
in
person.
so
that
on
that
day,
when
he
commenced
his
sentence
under
the
sex
crimes
act
apparently,
there
was
not
even
a
hearing
on
that
day.
now
then
he
went
–
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
now,
the
sentence
under
the
sex
crimes
act
is
an
indefinite
period
of
time
in
these
segments.
first,
you
go
for
the
maximum
period
for
which
you
could
have
been
sentenced.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes,
under
the
offense.
then
the
department,
if
it
believes
that
you
are
danger.
if
there
is
danger
to
the
public
from
releasing
you,
orders
you
extend
it
and
that
order
is
subject
to
review
of
a
court
and
they
can
extend
you
in
five-year
increments
without
limits.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
at
the
end
of
one-year
or
a
little
less
than
the
year,
in
april
of
1968,
under
which
he
had
been
sent
away,
july
24th
of
’67
and
april
of
1968,
the
department
issued
its
order
saying
that
this
could
be
extended
for
another
five-year
period.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes!
then
the
department
applied
to
the
county
court
of
waukesha
county
to
confirm
that
orders.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
and
goes
it
back
before
the
same
judge
but
it
turned
out
the
judge
was
not
there
and
someone
else
was
filling
in
for
him,
so
another
judge
then
heard
the
matter
and
there
was
a
hearing
on
july
23
of
1968,
on
the
order
of
the
department
to
extend
him.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes,
he
had
the
lady
lawyer
on
july
23.
mrs.
naft(ph)
who
--
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes,
he
did
your
honor.
he
had
counsel
and
he
pleaded
guilty,
through
the
original
offense
and
it
does
not,
the
record
does
not
indicate
why
that
counsel
was
not
called
at
the
time
he
was
actually
sentenced.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
if
there
was
a
hearing,
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
that
is
correct
your
honor.
according
to
the
order
of
the
court,
that
is
the
only
record
we
have,
that
is
the
court's
order
and
it
does
not
recite
the
presence
of
any
counsel
for
him.
it
says
that
the
defendant
appearing
in
person.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes
your
honor.
he
was
extended
for
five
years
which
would
have
made
it
1973.
however,
he
was
paroled
this
year
earlier,
in
march
of
this
year,
he
was
paroled.
so
at
the
present
time,
he
is
on
parole.
at
the
time
when
he
was
brought
back
for
this
hearing
to
confirm
the
extension
order
of
five
years,
he
was
there
represented
by
mrs.
naft.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
oh,
yes!
it
is
very
clear.
he
could
spend
the
rest
of
his
life.
there
is
no
time
limit
except
that
there
are
five
year
increments
and
it
must
be
confirmed
by
a
court.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes.
that
is
right!
that
in
the
opinion
of
the
department
his
release
would
be
dangerous
to
the
public.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
i
believe
that
he
is,
your
honor.
i
know
that
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
has
said
he
should
be.
there
was
a
case
in
wisconsin
huebner
case
which
the
court
set
out
the
procedural
requirements
and
clearly
indicated
that
person
is
entitled
to
counsel
and
it
should
be
represented
by
counsel.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
well,
they
talk
about
dangerous
in
this
your
honor
but
they
have
not
really
--,
i
think
explained
what
dangerous
means
other
than
it
does
not
necessarily
mean
physical
harm.
they
point
it
--
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
i
do
not
believe
so
your
honor.
i
do
not
believe
that
it
is
limited,
the
statute
certainly
does
not
say
that
and
i
am
not
aware
of
any
wisconsin
cases.
it
says
it
must
be
limited
to
sexual
problems.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
no,
at
the
time
when
he
was
sent
there,
wisconsin
had
no
separate
facility,
to
sexual
deviates.
the
appendix
to
the
respondents
brief
here
points
of
one
of
the
problems
in
wisconsin
of
getting
money
to
build
an
appropriate
facility.
they
did
not
have
it
and
they
–
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
well,
it
is
questionable
with
the
case
history
in
wisconsin
would
indicate
that
some
of
these
people
had
group
therapy.
and
that
was
considered
sufficient
treatment.
now
that
this
question
of
treatment
for
--
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes
sir.
it
is
prison,
it
was
the
state
prison
and
according
to
--
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
i
do
not
know
your
honor.
i
know
that
mr.
humphrey
was
paroled.
he
is
on
the
parole
at
the
present
time
so
apparently
they
thought
it
was
all
right
to
release
him.
now,
whether
they
were
tried
exercise
continued
to
control,
when
his
time
was
up
i
do
not
know.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes.
it
is
an
extension
of
five
year.
in
five
year
increments.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
no,
i
would
not
say
that
is
correct
your
honor.
apparently,
either
if
the
institutionalisation
itself
or
the
group
therapy
sessions
that
are
held.
for
some
reason,
persuades
the
official
that
as
to
this
man
for
example,
they
could
release
him.
so
in
their
mind,
something
happened
whether
it
actually,
whether
there
is
a
difference
or
not.
i
am
sure
that
mr.
humphrey
would
not
agree
that
he
received
any
treatment.
i
think
in
his
papers
that
he
filed
in
this
and
the
lower
court
–
(voice
overlap)
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
that
is
right
your
honor.
i
am
sure
that
is
true.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
no!
i
know
that
if
he
has
parole
conditions,
suppose
--
i
know
of
the
case,
where
a
man
was
found
drunk
and
driving.
now,
you
are
not
suppose
to
drink
when
you
are
on
parole
and
if
you
are
found
drunk
that
is
the
time
--
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
that
is
my
understanding
your
honor,
yes!
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
i
believe
there
are
some
psychiatrists
on
the
staff
and
also
some
psychologist,
social
workers
on
the
staff
that
are
there
and
wisconsin
now
has
recognized
the
need
for
additional
treatment.
i
think
as
the
respondent's
brief
indicates
commencing
in
this
year,
in
1970,
people
are
now
being
committed
to
what
is
called
the
central
state
hospital
which
is
an
institution
for
the
criminally
insane
in
wisconsin.
that
is
a
change
and
the
wisconsin
department
recognizes
the
need
for
a
special
institution
for
these
types
of
offenses
but
they
do
not
have
it
yet.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes,
it
does.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
that
is
it!
there
was
a
place
where
this
man
was
sent
--
was
the
maximum
security
institution
of
the
state
of
wisconsin.
with
the
walk
on
prison
is
the
place
where
appellants
go.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
i
do
not
know
your
honor.
i
know
that
the
recommendations
were
that
those
people
who
were
in
waukon
at
the
time
that
they
transferred
the
new
commencements
went
to
the
central
state
hospital
but
they
said
that
those
who
had
started
in
one
place
would
continue
there.
now,
i
do
not
know
what
would
happen
to
him
if
he
was
sent
back,
where
he
would
be
sent?
i
believe
that
that
is
an
administrative
function
by
the
department.
i
think,
i
had
gotten
in
my
chronology
to
the
point
where
the
department
had
asked
to
extend
him
for
five
years
and
it
came
up
for
a
hearing
and
he
was
then
represented
by
mrs.
naft
who
was
appointed
by
the
court
representative.
i
think
being
indigent
at
that
time.
mrs.
naft
advised
him
that
he
should
not
cooperate
with
court
appointed
psychiatrists
who
were
present
in
court
on
the
day
of
the
hearing
and
said
she
intended
to
raise
the
constitutional
issues.
the
court
ask
for
her
to
file
brief
sentence
and
that
was
agreed
a
brief
in
schedule
were
set
up
and
then
apparently
nothing
further
was
heard
from
mrs.
naft.
the
court
record
indicates
that
the
judge
wrote
a
letter
to
her
and
said
if
we
do
not
hear
from
you
we
are
going
to
conform
this
order
and
then
the
next
happened
is,
in
november
the
order
was
entered.
november
20,
1968,
judge
björk
who
was
the
substitute
judge
signed
an
order,
confirming
the
extension
for
five
years
and
in
his
order
which
is
found
in
the
appendix
on
page
14,
he
recites
the
fact
he
had
expected
to
get
briefs.
and
he
says
the
matter
having
been
adjourned
for
the
purpose
of
filing
briefs
to
support
their
respective
positions
to
the
state
in
the
defendant
and
no
briefs
having
been
filed
and
the
court
having
directed
correspondents
to
mrs.
naft
dated
october
15,
1968,
advising
mrs.
naft
smith
that
the
absence
of
the
filing
of
briefs
and
any
affirmative
acts
for
and
on
behalf
of
the
defendant
with
regard
to
this
matter,
the
court
would
presume
that
the
defendant
did
not
intent
to
offer
any
proof
as
to
its
condition
and
the
order
would
stand
and
accordingly,
he
confirmed
the
orders.
so
here
you
have
a
man
represented
by
an
attorney
who
did
not
do
anything
at
the
hearing,
no
cross
examine,
they
were
no
witnesses
presented
as
to
the
state
position
and
then
she
set
on,
i
am
going
to
argue
this
on
a
constitutional
basis
and
she
did
not
file
any
brief.
so
it
is
our
position
that-that
type
of
representation
is
equal
to
nothing.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
no!
i
do
not,
your
honor
because
i
think
that
that
--
there
maybe
a
basis
let
us
say,
it
is
up
to
the
state
to
show
this
man’s
condition.
and
this,
according
to
the
state
order,
they
claim
that
they
had
had
a
previous
psychiatric
examination
of
him,
they
see
it
on
the
records
and
files
based
on
his
commitment,
they
believe
he
is
dangerous.
so
i
think
that
they
could
come
into
court
based
upon
what
they
have
and
show
to
the
judge,
here
is
the
reason
that
we
think
this
man
should
be
continued
and
it
is
not
incumbent
upon
the
defendant
to
come
into
court
on
the
day
of
the
hearing
that
two
strange
doctors
brought
in
by
the
judge
and
expect
the
doctors
to
do
a
good
examination
in
a
short
period
of
time
while
you
are
waiting
for
this
case
to
be
heard.
and
i
say
that
i
do
not
think
that
the
man
has
the
right
to
have
his
own
psychiatrist
come
in
under
the
statute.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
the
record
really
does
not
indicate.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
statute
says
that.
the
statute
says
that
he
is
entitled
to
it.
i
am
not
sure
that
he
asked
for
that,
but
the
record
says
that
there
were
two
doctors
there
who
had
been
appointed
by
the
court.
why
they
were
there
does
not
appear
and
who
they
are
represented
does
not
appear.
and
in
any
event,
he
did
not
see
them.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
it
says
that
the
judge
should
appoint
psychiatrist
that
the
man
has
the
right
to
be
examined
by
a
psychiatrist
of
his
choice
and
that
the
court
will
--
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
no!
i
do
not
think
it
does,
your
honor.
i
do
not
know
what
is
the
basis
of
having
these
two
doctors
there
was.
unless
there
was
something
in
the
record
that
we
do
not
have
it,
in
case
somebody
asked
for
him.
i
do
not
know
what
they
were
doing
there.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes
sir!
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes!
he
did
not
ask
to
have
the
judge
appoint
a
doctor
for
him.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes!
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
i
think
the
line,
would
refuse
to
cooperate
is
the
judicial
language
act,
when
you
are
asking
me,
you
honor
whether
i
consider
that
to
be
court
advise
or
whether
i
would
base
my
charge
of
lack
of
adequate
representation
on
that.
i
would
not
say
that,
that
was
because
i
am
not
sure
that
the
lawyer
was
improper
in
directing
him
not
to
have
a
previous
examination.
i
do
not
know
what
the
result
of
that
would
have
been.
i
am
not
claiming
that,
that
is
the
kind
of
error.
in
any
event,
he
was
extended
for
five
years
and
then
after
that
extension,
he
then
commenced
the
series
of
procedures
which
has
brought
him
here.
he
applied
to
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
in
october
of
1969,
he
filed
a
petition,
there
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
it
was
denied.
he
was
without
counsel,
it
was
denied
without
hearing
and
without
even
asking
for
response
and
then
he
went
to
the
united
states
district
court
and
finally,
we
got
him
out
of
this
court.
now,
what
are
the
points
that
we
wish
to
phrase
with
you
regards
to
his
treatment,
i
think.
the
first
thing,
i
want
to
point
out
is
the
difference
or
the
disparity
between
the
treatment
of
man
under
the
wisconsin
sex
crimes
act
and
especially,
i
say
those
which
are
not
the
mandatory,
not
rape,
that
thing
but
any
other
crime
where
the
judge
find
that
maybe
sexually
motivated.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
no,
he
did
not
have
a
hearing
your
honor.
there
was
a
response
filed
by
the
state
whether
it
was
denied
without
a
hearing.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes
your
honor.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
no
your
honor.
this
case
is
very
peculiar
posture.
the
trial
courts
denied
him
a
certificate
of
probable
cause,
so
he
could
not
appeal.
then
he
filed
an
application
for
certificate
of
probable
cause
to
the
court
of
appeals
with
seventh
circuit
and
that
was
denied.
and
then
he
filed
the
petition
with
this
court
and
it
was
granted,
so
that
this
court
has
never
been
heard
by
them,
this
case
is
not
been
heard
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
there
was
no
hearing
in
the
district
court.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
well,
it
is
partly,
that
it
is
my
feeling
that
the
wisconsin
statute
on
its
face
which
i
think
we
can
look
at
without
going
into
the
factual
things,
is
improper,
is
unconstitutional.
and
that
the
wisconsin’s
supreme
court
has
so
interpreted
that
statute
as
to
be
in
conflict
with
this
court's
decision
with
the
baxstrom
case.
in
the
baxstrom
case
which
was
the
case
in
new
york
where
you
had
a
person
who
had
been
sentenced
on
an
assault
charge.
i
think
it
was
a
second
degree
assault.
so
certainly,
you
have
some
question
of
physical
danger
there.
a
man
was
sentenced
i
think
it
is
about
two
and-a-half
years
and
toward
the
end
of
his
sentence,
they
filed
a
petition
saying
this
man
is
insane.
it
requires
his
mental
treatment.
so
then
there
was
a
proceeding
and
he
was
committed
to
an
effect
a
criminal
type
facility
for
treatment
and
it
came
to
this
court
and
this
court
compared
that
treatment
that
he
got
with
what
a
person
under
a
civil
commitment
was
entitled
to
in
the
state
of
new
york
and
said
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
because
that
person
should
have
been
entitled
to
his
same
treatment
a
person
civilly
committed
guy.
now,
i
think
that
is
very
applicable
to
the
state
of
wisconsin.
here
we
have
a
person
who
our
man,
he
get
sentenced
on
a
crime
contributing
to
the
delinquency
of
a
child
and
then
at
the
end
of
one
year
which
is
the
maximum
for
which
he
can
be
sentenced,
he
is
again
committed.
now,
there
is
a
great
difference
between
that
and
what
would
happen
if
he
were
civilly
committed
because
he
is
not
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
and
under
the
wisconsin
mental
health
act
which
we
set
forth,
every
person
in
wisconsin
who
is
convicted
civilly
is
entitled
to
have
that
question
determined
by
a
jury.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
under
the
mental
health
act,
he
would
be
committed
if
he
were
mentally
ill,
infirm
or
deficient.
mentally
ill,
it
means
a
mental
disease
requiring
care
for
the
welfare
for
yourself
or
other
community.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes,
i
think
it
might
include
in.
now,
the
wisconsin
--
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes,
we
would,
your
honor.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes!
he
is
entitled
to
reexamination
under
both
the
mental
health
act
and
sex
crimes
act
but
even
there,
there
is
a
difference.
under
the
sex
crimes
act,
you
are
not
entitled
--
ask
for
a
reexamination
until
you
have
served
the
maximum
period
for
which
under
the
crime.
in
other
words
in
our
brief,
we
say
if
you
are
sentence
for
rape
for
example,
under
the
sex
crimes
act
that
is
a
30
years
maximum.
you
cannot
ask
for
reexamination
on
your
mental
condition
for
30
years.
now,
under
the
mental
health
act
in
wisconsin,
when
you
are
committed,
you
can
ask
for
a
reexamination
at
any
time
after
recommitment
and
you
got
a
hearing
and
a
jury
and
then
you
can
ask
for
reexamination
but
you
cannot
require
it,
more
frequently
than
once
a
year.
now
under
the
sex
crimes
act,
you
have
to
wait
before
they
serve
the
maximum
and
then
you
can
ask
for
a
reexamination
and
after
examination,
you
do
not
get
a
jury
trial.
in
addition
--
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes
your
honor.
on
the
criminal
charge,
no
question,
he
would
be
entitled
for
a
jury
trial.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes
your
honor.
the
thing
the
jury
though
would
not
pass
upon
the
question
of
whether
the
offense
was
sexually
motivated.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
this
is
something
which
the
judge
adds
onto
the
criminal
proceeding,
where
you
have
a
criminal
charge
levied
against
you,
the
issues
are
“did
you
commit
that
offense?”
here
the
answer
is
“yes!”
i
gave
beer
to
a
minor,
i
am
guilty.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
so
then
you
have
the
question
of
exposing
him
to
this
new
--
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
it
is
not,
it
is
in
the
sentence
that
is
in
part
of
it.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes!
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
i
do
not
know,
your
honor.
i
know
it
was
one
of
the
early
statutes
--
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes!
it
is
a
long
standing.
your
honor,
in
connection
with
that,
i
am
sorry
that
i
did
not
get
a
hold
of
this
until
just
a
few
days
ago.
this
is
an
excellent
book,
'the
mentally
disabled
and
the
law,'
which
is
published
by
the
american
law
foundation
in
chicago
university
of
chicago
press
and
has
a
very
good
discussion
of
this
whole
area,
i
would
cited
it
more
sensibly
in
my
brief.
i
had
known
about
it
but
i
just
got
hold
of
it.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
i
appreciate
doing
that.
i
think
your
honor
if
i
have
few
minutes,
i
will
reserve
them.
thank
you.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
i
am
just
going
to
respond
briefly
to
the
question
of
what
triggers
this
proceeding
because
my
belief
and
understanding
is
that
nothing
may
trigger
it
other
than
the
judge's
own
intuition
or
prior
knowledge
of
this
person
or
the
fact
that
the
community
is
presently
angry
about
a
certain
type
thing,
so
the
statute
does
not
require
any
basis
and
i
say
the
statute
does
not
require
a
hearing
on
the
question
of
whether
the
person
is
sexually
motivated
and
this
record
does
not
show
any
such
hearing.
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
in
the
buchanan
case,
that
we
cite,
i
say
has
laid
down
--
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
of
course,
your
honor.
yes,
no
question
about
that
and
i
--,
that
is
very
difficult
for
the
district
court.
your
honor,
i
was
in
the
law
court
and
federal
district
court,
know
how
hard
is
to
examine
all
these
things
and
pick
out
the
good
ones
and
there
was
no
lawyer
who
examine
it
and
the
judge
upon
the
issue
that
the
petitioner
himself
set
forth
the
judges
thought
that
this
was
not
a
meritorious
case.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
that
would
be
very
much
easier.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes,
he
is
your
honor.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
judge,
i
do
not
really
know
the
answer
to
that
and
i
believe
there
is
a
big
chance
that
he
goes
back
to
prison.
and
even
--
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
i
do
not
know.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
they
say
that
he
would
go
to
the
state
central
hospital.
your
honor,
which
is
a
institution
for
the
criminally
insane.
it
is
a
penal
mental
mental
institution.
it
is
not
where
people
go
on
sooner.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes,
he
was.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes,
the
people.
yes,
i
think
we
point
it
on
our
brief
that
a
person
who
is
civilly
committed;
there
is
no
provision
for
sending
him
to
that
institution.
he
may
go
to
a
hospital
if
he
is
civilly
committed.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
well,
i
think
that
maybe
true
although
in
the
case
of
jones
v.
cunningham
i
think
we
cite,
where
there
was
a
young
man
was
on
the
parole.
it
was
pointed
out
the
fact
that
he
is
on
the
parole,
we
are
not
making
the
case
moot
and
i
think
really
here,
the
respondents
is
the
state
of
wisconsin.
the
attorney
general,
the
supreme
court
of
state
of
wisconsin,
the
whole
prison
system
and
the
welfare
is
under
one
direction,
so
he
is
(inaudible).
it
arises
from
the
fact
that
he
was
paroled
in
march
of
this
and
the
writ
was
granted
in
march
also.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
yes!
oh
yes!
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
the
petition
has
been
filed
last
year.
mr.
irvin
b.
charne
thank
you
very
much.
it
has
been
a
honor
to
be
here.
