mr.

chief

warren
e.

would
your
case
be
any
different
if
this
was
a
25-year-old
professional
football
player
in
the
peak
of
physical
condition
and
health?

chief

e.

let
us
make
him
an
unemployed
professional
football
player
that
is
indigent,
then
it
would
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
anytime
in
the
course
of
these
proceedings
was
there
a
tender
of
the
rent
into
the
custody
of
the
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
it
was
really
in
the
custody
of
the
court
because
you
were
holding
it
as
an
officer
of
the
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
clough,
i
seem
to
have
missed
something.
when
i
first
asked
you
about
depositing
the
rent
in
the
custody
of
the
court
or
under
the
control
of
the
court
somewhere,
i
thought
your
response
was
that
this
was
done
as
a
discretionary
matter,
but
judge
not
as
a
matter
of
any
requirement
under
the
oregon
statute.
will
you
clear
that
up
for
me?
does
the
oregon
statute
require
the
payment
of
the
money,
the
rent
in
escrow?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
my
first
impression
was
correct
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
would
you
think
that
was
a
reasonable
condition
uniformly
to
be
attached
to
any
right
to
maintain
possession?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
you
did
not
have
that
deposit
in
escrow,
might
you
not
be
confronted,
whether
a
counter
suggestion
that
this
was
a
taking
of
property
without
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
taking
of
the
landlord’s
property
without
due
process
and
without
compensation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
you
would
accept
that
as
an
invariable
condition
to
maintaining
possession?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
be
here
if
that
were
20
days,
mr.
clough?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
us
back-up
to
a
case
where
there
is
a
tenancy
from
month-to-month
and
for
reasons
not
disclosed
the
landlord
decides
he
wants
to
terminate
the
tenancy
and
gives
the
appropriate
notices
and
at
the
end
of
the
notice
period,
the
tenant
declines
to
leave,
claiming
that
it
is
very
inconvenient,
there
is
no
other
housing
available,
etcetera.
now,
that
you
say
that
there
is
a
due
process
right
to
remain,
it
would
in
turn
will
enable
them
to
remain
in
possession,
notwithstanding
the
landlord’s
compliance
with
the
statute
in
giving
them
notice?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
in
that
situation
the
landlord
can
evict
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
would
be
no
defense?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
if
he
has
a
one
year
lease
or
the
things
that
mr.
justice
stewart
was
talking
to
you
about
in
alternative,
that
if
you
have
a
clear
case
of
that
kind
where
there
is
no
valid
defense,
then
you
concede
that
the
landlord
can
evict
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
the
two
days
would
not
be
a
problem
for
you
in
that
circumstance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
you
come
down
to
a
claim
of
unconstitutionality
of
the
statute
as
applied
rather
than
facially,
it
that
not
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
six
of
one-and-a-half
dozen
of
the
other
has
applied
with
the
specific
case,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
jensen.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
pay
it
in
the
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
not
the
court
have
inherent
power
to
do
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
alright.
we
resume
after
lunch
now,
mr.
jensen.[lunch
break]
mr.
jensen,
you
may
proceed
with
your
argument,
you
have
about
13
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
statute
is
cast
in
terms
of
double
the
rent,
and
therefore,
if
it
was
30
days,
he
would
get
double
30
days
rent,
is
that
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
jensen.
you
have
four
minutes
left
mr.
clough.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
within
the
framework
of
this
case
the
issue
is
i
suppose
could
this
statute
hypothetically
be
saved
by
saying
that
oregon
was
give
the
same
time
to
answer
in
these
cases
as
in
any
other
civil
action
by
reference
to
the
particular
statute
governs
that
the
10
or
20-day
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
want
10
or
20
days,
do
you
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
conceded
earlier
this
morning
that
conventional
statutory
time
to
answer
in
actions
in
oregon
of
10
to
20
days
was
a
reasonable
time
you
were
making
an
argument
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
if
you
got
that,
you
would
be
satisfied,
would
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
not
suggesting
it
can
be
done
that
way.
i
would
test
whether
that
is
what
you
want
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
would
dissolve
this
whole
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
else
would
remain?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.

did
i
understand
mr.
jensen
to
say
that
equitable
--
all
equitable
remedies
were
available?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
we
find
that
out
except
by
reading
those
cases,
do
those
cases
reveal
it?
chief

you
