mr.
john
h.
clough
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
three-judge
court’s
denial
of
injunctive
and
declaratory
relief,
sought
by
donald
and
edna
lindsey
on
behalf
of
themselves
and
the
class
of
appellants,
including
all
tenants
in
the
state
of
oregon.
the
lindsey’s
attack
to
constitutionality
of
oregon’s
eviction
law,
seeking
to
enjoin
its
enforcement
of
it
is
objectionable
provisions
by
appellee
judges.
the
lindseys
had
been
having
difficulties
in
getting
there
landlord,
appellee
normet
to
repair
the
condition
of
their
home
which
condition
included
lack
of
plaster,
downstairs
toilet
out
of
order,
missing
rear
steps,
etcetera.
since
pictures
are
better
than
words,
we
specifically
refer
the
court
to
the
color
photographs
in
evidence
marked
as
plaintiff’s
exhibits
number
25
to
37
in
the
record.
on
november
10
--
mr.
john
h.
clough
no,
they
are
not.
they
were
unable
to
print
them
because
they
were
color
photographs,
your
honor.
on
november
10,
1969,
their
home
had
been
condemned
by
the
bureau
of
building
inspections
of
the
city
of
portland
because
of
the
violation
of
portland’s
housing
and
building
codes.
since
donald
lindsey
was
substantially
confined
to
a
wheelchair
with
crippling
arthritis
of
both
arms
and
legs
and
neither
he
nor
his
wife
could
drive
a
car,
they
did
not
have
the
mobility
to
search
for
another
home.
furthermore,
their
search
would
have
been
rendered
more
difficult
by
the
factor
that
the
overall
vacancy
rate
for
portland
was
less
than
2%
and
for
low
income
families
less
than
1%.
mr.
john
h.
clough
in
some
respects
it
might
and
some
respects
it
might
not.
there
are
some
aspects
of
the
case.
mr.
john
h.
clough
yes,
some
aspects
of
the
case
would
make
a
difference
because
of
the
indigency
and
ability
to
search
for
a
home.
although,
constitutionally
–-
mr.
john
h.
clough
constitutionally,
it
would
make
no
difference.
low-income
housing
is
that
which
has
rents
within
the
financial
reach
of
a
typical
family
of
four
whose
income
is
from
$0-4,000.00
a
year.
in
portland,
an
estimated
75%
of
low
income
families
rent,
but
lindsey’s
home
was
a
low-income
home.
most
housing
available
for
low-income
families
is
quite
often
substandard
and
the
condition
is
generally
very
poor
in
portland.
low-income
people
pay
a
higher
portion
of
their
monthly
income
for
rent
and
generally
pay
higher
utility
in
heating
bills
because
of
deficiencies
in
plumbing,
insulation
and
wiring.
mr.
john
h.
clough
yes,
it
is
your
honor.
the
last
statement,
mr.
justice
blackmun
was
in
the
deposition
of
josephine
brown,
our
expert
which
is
admitted
into
evidence
and
as
plaintiff's
exhibit
number
24
at
page
26.
low-income
people
generally
have
a
difficult
time
finding
a
place
because
of
the
advance
month’s
rent
for
cleaning
deposits
often
required.
after
the
request
to
the
landlord
to
repair
these
conditions
and
no
action
was
forthcoming,
they
decided
to
attempt
to
improve
their
lot
where
they
lived
and
withheld
their
rent
on
december
1,
1969
to
compel
their
landlord
to
repair
the
premises.
mr.
john
h.
clough
the
court
had
the
option
and
the
court
preferred
--
the
tender
was
offered
at
the
institution
of
the
proceedings
and
the
court
preferred
that
we
as
their
attorneys
keep
the
money
in
our
escrow
account
and
specifically
condition
to
temporary
restraining
order
based
upon
that.
mr.
john
h.
clough
that
is
correct.
on
december
15,
1969,
they
were
sent
a
letter
from
their
landlord’s
attorney
demanding
them
to
pay
rent
or
vacate.
at
this
point,
they
were
faced
with
the
realities
of
having
an
eviction
action
filed
against
them,
pursuant
to
the
statute
under
attack
in
this
appeal.
there
was
no
question
that
an
eviction
would
cause
the
lindseys
irreparable
harm.
evictions
of
low-income
families
often
result
in
a
continuing
downward
and
tightening
spar
which
they
find
an
emotional
block
to
overcome.
they
do
not
have
the
cost
of
moving
and
they
cannot
find
housing.
they
are
often
forced
into
less
adequate
housing.
they
lose
standing
in
the
community
and
in
their
children’s
eyes
and
large
families
are
often
split
up.
in
this
background,
this
action
was
filed
in
the
federal
district
court
prior
to
any
eviction
action
being
filed
by
the
lindsey’s
landlord.
the
best
way
to
describe
the
operation
of
the
eviction
statute
is
by
taking
the
lindseys
through
their
eviction,
had
one
been
filed
by
their
landlord.
a
complaint
and
summons
would
be
filed
and
served
upon
the
lindseys,
setting
the
time
for
trial
within
two
to
four
days
which
may
include
weekends.
mr.
john
h.
clough
no.
mr.
john
h.
clough
that
is
correct.
i
am
using
the
lindseys
as
what
would
happen
to
describe
the
operation
of
the
statute.
for
example,
they
could
be
served
on
a
friday
with
a
trial
set
on
monday
or
tuesday.
however,
two
days
is
all
the
time
for
trial
that
the
tenant
has
a
matter
of
right.
within
this
time,
they
would
have
to
contact
the
lawyer,
make
an
appointment
and
get
him
to
take
the
case.
his
first
move
would
be
to
ask
for
continuance
and
all
that
he
could
get
without
posting
cash
security
would
be
two
days,
the
granting
of
which
is
only
the
discretionary
under
the
statute.
even
though
that
defenses
that
lindseys
would
like
to
raise
would
not
be
heard
by
the
oregon
courts
because
of
the
statute
he
is
challenging.
he
might
still
have
conventional
defenses
based
upon
issues
of
fact,
regarding
what
rent
was
agreed
to
or
if
it
were
truly
paid.
litigation
of
these
issues
may
well
require
interviewing
potential
witnesses,
subpoenaing
them,
legal
research
and
trial
preparation.
at
trial,
lindsey
would
want
to
raise
defenses
based
upon
his
landlord’s
refusal
to
obey
the
housing
codes,
but
these
defenses
will
not
be
heard
or
adjudicated
on
their
merits.
the
reason
for
this
is
found
on
the
face
of
the
oregon
statutes.
they
provide
that
the
landlord’s
complaint
is
sufficient
as
it
states:
(1)
a
description
of
the
premises,
(2)
that
the
defendant
is
in
possession,
(3)
that
the
defendant
unlawfully
holds
by
force
which
is
deemed
to
include
failure
to
pay
rent
within
10
days
after
it
is
due,and
(4)
that
the
landlord
is
entitled
to
possession.
the
statute
goes
on
to
provide
that
if
the
court
or
jury
finds
the
complaint
to
be
true,
the
tenants
shall
be
evicted.
thus,
these
statutes
on
their
face
preclude
the
raising
of
affirmative
legal
defenses
and
they
have
been
so
construed
by
the
oregon
courts.
mr.
john
h.
clough
the
last
time
that
the
fed,
the
eviction
law
was
changed
in
any
matter
was
in
1909,
although
the
case
of
friedenthal
v.
thompson
goes
into
a
historical
analysis
where
they
were
in
effect
back
in
the
middle
1800s.
mr.
john
h.
clough
there
has
been
an
effort
yes,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
john
h.
clough
no,
i
do
not,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
john
h.
clough
the
question
has
been
raised,
mr.
justice
blackmun
in
several
cases
that
have
gone
up
to
the
oregon
supreme
court
on
various
aspects.
so
that
for
example
friedenthal
v.
thompson
involved
the
constrictions
on
limitations
of
time.
there
were
several
cases
that
sought
to
raise
equitable
types
of
offenses
and
these
were
interpreted
by
oregon
supreme
court.
the
double
rent
bond
on
appeal
has
been
construed
by
the
oregon
supreme
court
and
been
upheld
as
constitutional.
legal
defenses
had
been
specifically
disallowed
by
the
oregon
supreme
court.
mr.
john
h.
clough
of
course,
that
would
be
a
very
welcome
response,
but
the
legislature
of
oregon
has
not
seen
as
to
do
so
and
our
--
one
of
the
main
lines
of
attack
that
we
have
here
on
the
statute
is
due
process
which
--
that
does
not
matter
that
the
statute
either
procedural
like
constricts
the
courts
and
the
litigants
so
that
the
it
dives
in
due
process
or
it
does
not.
well,
that
is
true
of
any
statute.
any
statute
could
be
changed
at
any
given
time
by
state
legislature.
under
the
oregon
statutes,
the
fact
that
the
tenant
may
would
have
withheld
rent
because
the
landlord
failed
to
make
proper
repairs
or
the
fact
that
the
landlord
brought
the
action
in
retaliation
for
the
tenant
having
recorded
code
violations
to
a
city
agency
or
complaint
to
the
landlord
or
even
the
fact
that
the
action
is
brought
because
of
the
tenant’s
raise.
those
facts
are
not
only
considered
irrelevant,
they
are
not
even
heard.
these
defenses
are
not
judged
on
their
merits.
they
are
not
even
heard
and
are
stricken.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trial,
if
the
tenant
looses
and
desires
to
remain
in
the
premises,
pending
the
appeal
to
the
circuit
court,
he
must
post
an
open-ended
double
rent
bond
to
guarantee
twice
the
amount
of
the
rent
to
be
paid
from
the
inception
of
the
action
until
final
determination
by
the
appellate
court.
mr.
john
h.
clough
not
at
all,
as
long
as
it
becomes
due.
mr.
john
h.
clough
because
of
the
indigent
tenant,
but
there
is
no
objection
to
that.
mr.
john
h.
clough
if
the
situation
is
such
--
mr.
john
h.
clough
yes,
it
is
the
case
is
what
as
such
lends
itself,
that
paying
it
to
the
landlord
would
defeat
the
whole
purpose.
mr.
john
h.
clough
that
is
true,
but
would
not,
that
action
would
not
stay
this
proceeding
and
that
the
whole
issue
here
--
mr.
john
h.
clough
not
in
an
independent
action
for
contract,
but
the
issue
here
is
possession
of
the
premises.
mr.
john
h.
clough
and
that
is
the
key
issue
that
the
tenant
is
interested
in.
mr.
john
h.
clough
by
continuing
to
pay
the
rent
of
the
landlord,
but
then
it
defeats
this
whole
purpose.
mr.
john
h.
clough
the
problem
--
the
problem
with
that
is
it
forces
every
tenant
into
litigation.
the
--
mr.
john
h.
clough
but
even
--
mr.
john
h.
clough
that
is
quite
correct.
however
--
mr.
john
h.
clough
and
you
will
also
be
separated
from
your
property,
if
the
landlord
decides
to
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
h.
clough
he
could
give
a
30-day
notice
in
retaliation
for
your
invoking
the
court
procedures
and
what
this
action
would
do,
would
force
them
to
involve
the
--
mr.
john
h.
clough
yes.
mr.
john
h.
clough
only
for
the
time
of
the
continuance.
mr.
john
h.
clough
if
he
gets
a
continuance
and
it
must
be
cash
in
advance.
in
other
words,
he
cannot
--
if
he
is
an
indigent
tenant
who
has
his
money
carefully
budgeted
he
could
not
financially
afford
to
pay
enough
to
get
a
continuance
for
two
or
three
months.
mr.
john
h.
clough
a
continuance
of
hearing,
the
possessory
action,
the
action
for
eviction.
mr.
john
h.
clough
that
would
vary
depending
on
how
much
time
he
has.
mr.
john
h.
clough
well,
presumably
under
our
situation
he
would
have
that
money
that
if
he
were
in
default
on
it
and
there
will
no
objection
to
that.
mr.
john
h.
clough
we
would
have
no
objection
to
that,
but
that
is
not
the
way
to
that
statute
operates.
mr.
john
h.
clough
you
have
to
put
up
cash
in
advance.
in
other
words,
if
he
desired
a
continuance
for
two
months,
he
would
right
then
and
there
have
to
put
up
cash
and
guarantee
it
for
two
months.
mr.
john
h.
clough
no,
it
does
not,
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
john
h.
clough
your
first
impression
was
correct.
i
thought
you
were
referring
to
the
federal
court
action.
the
court
below
opted
the
rent
escrow.
mr.
john
h.
clough
that
was
the
three-judge
court,
yes.
mr.
john
h.
clough
perfectly
reasonable
or
some
variation.
however,
the
court
felt
this
would
be
something
for
the
state
courts
to
work
out.
mr.
john
h.
clough
of
course.
mr.
john
h.
clough
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
h.
clough
yes,
we
would
have
no
problems
with
that
whatsoever.
the
double
rent
bond
on
appeal
is
in
addition
to
the
usual
cost
bond.
this
bond
may
be
filed
as
a
cash
bond,
personal
bond
or
for
maturity
bond,
in
any
event
with
two
sureties.
it
is
open
ended
and
may
last
for
a
month
or
a
year.
within
five
days
after
the
posting
of
the
bond,
the
landlord
can
require
justification
of
the
sureties
by
their
presence
in
court.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
appeal,
if
the
tenant
loses,
the
landlord
simply
executes
on
the
bond
or
if
the
money
has
been
paid
into
court,
upon
the
filing
of
the
order,
it
is
simply
dispersed.
the
landlord
collects
the
entire
amount
of
the
bond,
not
just
to
the
damages
or
expenses
if
any.
if
the
tenant
loses
at
the
circuit
court,
he
may
appeal
to
the
state
supreme
court
and
the
same
process
is
again
repeated.
we
are
challenging
the
three-major
restrictions
on
the
low-income
tenant’s
ability
to
properly
defend
himself
in
oregon.
these
are;
first,
the
short
time
to
prepare
for
trial,
(2)
the
refusal
of
the
court
to
hear
his
defenses
and
(3)
the
denial
of
his
ability
to
appeal
because
of
the
double
rent
bond
requirement.
we
contend
that
these
restrictions
violate
both
the
equal
protection
and
due
process
clauses
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
they
affect
certain
fundamental
interests
of
the
tenant.
the
first
of
these
fundamental
interests
is
his
right
to
retain
peaceful
possession
of
his
home
or
the
sanctity
of
the
home.
second,
is
his
right
to
decent
housing.
third,
his
right
to
meaningful
access
to
and
equal
treatment
in
the
courts.
while
all
of
these
interests
has
been
treated
as
fundamental
by
this
court
in
various
decisions,
the
right
to
retain
peaceful
possession
of
once
home
has
received
the
most
attention,
from
the
court
being
protected
under
the
third,
fourth,
fifth,
ninth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
for
example
in
silverman
versus
united
states
at
365
u.s.,
this
court
rejected
evidence
obtained
by
the
use
of
spiked
mike
which
intruded
several
inches
under
the
wall
of
the
defendant’s
home
as
it
would
have
obtained
by
“actual
intrusion”
into
a
constitutionally
protected
area.
in
camara
versus
municipal
court
at
387
u.s.,
this
court
held
that
a
warrant
must
be
obtained
before
homes
can
be
inspected
by
city
agencies.
and
in
rowan
versus
united
states
post
office
department,
this
court
upheld
in
the
face
of
the
first
amendment
attack,
a
statute
protecting
householders
from
junk
mail
intrusions.
if
this
court
has
found
the
sanctity
of
the
home
to
be
worthy
of
constitutional
protection
against
these
sporadic
intrusions,
how
much
more
worthy
a
protection
is
the
right
to
be
free
from
a
total
ousting
of
possession?
total
ousting
by
the
county
sheriff
is
what
faces
the
tenant
who
looses
an
eviction
action
in
oregon.
it
is
almost
inevitable
under
the
procedures
we
are
challenging.
in
addition,
certain
of
the
restrictions,
we
are
dealing
with
involve
a
suspect
classification,
one
based
upon
wealth,
since
indigent
tenants
do
not
have
the
resources
to
post
either
the
continuance
bond
or
the
double
rent
appeal
bond.
we
do
not
feel
that
we
are
asking
for
anything
unreasonable
in
this
case.
we
fully
recognize
that
there
are
certain
interests
of
the
landlord
that
the
state
of
oregon
may
reasonably
protect,
if
it
wishes
to
do
so.
the
main
interest
meant
to
be
protected
by
the
restrictions
we
are
challenging
is
the
landlord's
desire
to
see
that
he
will
not
lose
rent
money,
he
may
have
come
into
it
during
the
litigation,
that
he
eventually
might
win.
statutes
designed
to
protect
this
interest
should
be
constitutional
if
they
are
reasonable,
but
the
restrictions
involved
here
go
too
far.
they
are
unreasonable
at
the
expense
of
the
tenant’s
interests
in
protecting
his
home.
we
can
understand,
for
example,
shortening
the
time
to
prepare
for
trial
on
eviction
action
to
something
less
than
that
available
to
other
defendants.
but
only
two
days
as
a
matter
of
right
is
so
short
as
to
make
the
mockery
of
the
judicial
system.
mr.
john
h.
clough
if
that
were
20
days,
probably
not
on
that
issue.
it
would
depend
entirely
how
that
the
oregon
court
has
set
up
the
procedure.
mr.
john
h.
clough
payment
is
one.
yes
actually
--
mr.
john
h.
clough
there
are
certain
equitable
types
of
defenses
such
as
showing
that
agreement
between
the
parties
was
something
aside
from
what
its
apparent
nature
was
and
their
true
relationship
was
not
that
of
landlord-tenant
such
as,
a
deed
is
really
a
mortgage,
and
therefore,
the
eviction
procedure
should
not
be
used,
the
oregon
procedure
should
be
used
(voice
overlap).
mr.
john
h.
clough
no
those
would
still
be
landlord-tenant
and
they
will
still
be
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
h.
clough
that
the
lease,
that
there
is
in
fact
a
lease
for
year,
a
written
lease
that
may
be
it
depends
depending
on
the
circumstances
of
the
case,
but
again
we
are
dealing
with
that
fourth
item
in
the
complaint
with
landlord’s
right
to
the
possession,
not
the
third
item
which
we
are
concerned
with
raising
any
contractual
defenses.
mr.
john
h.
clough
like
the
time
is
contingent
upon
the
ability
to
raise
its
defenses
of
course.
mr.
john
h.
clough
in
theory
that
(voice
overlap)
that
would
be
available.
mr.
john
h.
clough
some
of
them,
there
is
none
filed
in
the
lindsey
case.
mr.
john
h.
clough
there
were
three
others
and
for
various
reasons
those
three
cases
settled
and
were
never
appealed.
mr.
john
h.
clough
the
case
in
controversy
is
that
he
threatened
eviction
into
invoke
the
use
of
the
courts.
mr.
john
h.
clough
but
he
never
did
because
of
this
action.
mr.
john
h.
clough
because
there
was
a
restraining
order
issue
in
this
action.
mr.
john
h.
clough
not
in
the
fact
situation
mr.
chief
justice
that
you
gave
to
me.
mr.
john
h.
clough
he
would
have
no
defense.
mr.
john
h.
clough
however,
if
he
were
raising
the
defense
that
he
should
be
entitled
to
at
least
raise
and
be
heard
on
a
defense
that
the
landlord
is
evicting
for
example
in
retaliation,
puts
testimony
in,
but
that
is
not
the
fact
--
mr.
john
h.
clough
of
course,
there
is
no
denial
of
due
process
because
the
defense
has
not
been
raised.
mr.
john
h.
clough
yes,
but
the
statute
is
over
inclusive
because
it
includes
all
of
these
other
situations
too.
there
is
no
differentiating
between
that
type
of
situation
and
the
type
of
situation
where
the
tenant
seeks
to
raise
retaliatory
eviction
as
a
defense.
mr.
john
h.
clough
it
would
be
on
its
face
because
the
statute
is
over
inclusive
on
its
face.
mr.
john
h.
clough
it
might
be
merged
to
both,
yes.
i
like
to
reserve
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
h.
clough
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
just
few
comments.
contrary
to
the
apprehensions
here
that
had
been
cast,
we
still
need
time
to
prepare
for
conventional
defenses
and
we
still
maintain
that
the
two-day
time
limit
as
a
matter
of
right
is
too
short
to
even
prepare
for
those
such
as
to
find
out
the
issues
as
to
what
rent
is
agreed
to.
they
may
need
witnesses
to
testify
as
to
whether
or
not
rent
is
in
fact
been
paid
or
whether
rent
receipts
are
available
and
in
connection
with
that,
the
attorney
still
has
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
there
is
in
fact
a
valid
defense
and
he
needs
more
time
in
order
to
do
that.
the
third
point
is
regarding
the
joining
of
the
action
for
rent
and
fed
under
--
in
our
brief
at
page
48
footnote
13,
we
have
cited
two
statutory
provisions
which
provide
that
the
action
for
rent
can
be
joined
with
an
fed,
but
at
that
point
the
case
is
severed
and
the
action
for
rent
proceeds
as
any
other
lawsuit
with
the
fed
proceeding
close
forward.
the
fourth
point
is
the
--
i
would
refer
the
court
to
plaintiff’s
exhibit
number
14
which
is
the
letter
sent
to
the
lindseys
by
the
normet’s
attorney.
it
speaks
for
itself
regarding
whether
not
it
threatens
eviction.
essentially,
all
that
appellants
are
asking
for
is
a
chance
to
be
able
to
change
the
law
in
oregon.
we
do
not
ask
this
court
to
change
any
substantive
rule
of
law.
that
is
for
the
courts
of
oregon
to
do
and
that
is
for
them
to
use
the
principles
of
the
common
law
and
develop,
we
will
seek
to
have
them
adopt
the
consumer
protection
principles
that
have
been
analogize
to
landlord-
tenant
law
in
other
jurisdictions
which
they
are
free
to
do
absent
the
statute
so
we
are
essentially
asking
for
chance.
mr.
john
h.
clough
you
mean
by
a
construction
of
the
statute?
there
is
no
construction
of
the
statute
that
the
statute
is
very
explicit
it
says
to
--
mr.
john
h.
clough
whatever
reasonable
enough
period
of
time
in
order
to
--
mr.
john
h.
clough
oh!
yes.
mr.
john
h.
clough
on
the
time
limitation.
mr.
john
h.
clough
on
the
time
limitations,
that
would
be
true.
mr.
john
h.
clough
no,
it
would
not
dissolve
this
whole
case.
mr.
john
h.
clough
that
the
ability
to
raise
defenses
would
still
remain
and
the
double-rent
bond
on
appeal
and
the
continuance
bond.
those
issues
are
still
in
this
case
no
matter
what
happens
to
the
time
limitations
because
you
still
have
the
constrictions
of
the
statute
that
would
apply,
no
matter
whether
he
had
10
days,
50
days
or
2
days.
mr.
john
h.
clough
it
is
an
open-ended
bond,
mr.
justice.
it
is
for
no
specified
amount.
it
is
a
virtual
impossibility
to
obtain
a
surety
bond.
surety
bond
companies
just
would
not
write
them.
mr.
john
h.
clough
we
have
the
oregon
cases
that
are
listed
in
the
brief,
scales
v.
spencer
and
priester
v.
thrall
specifically
dealing
with
the
double-rent
bond
on
appeal
and
describe
how
it
operates.
the
other
types
of
cases
are
appeals
that
have
been
taken,
but
quite
effectively
it
does
preclude
almost
any
right
to
appeal
and
most
of
those
cases
involve
commercial
leases,
not
residential
leases.
mr.
john
h.
clough
scales
v.
spencer,
priester
v.
thrall
involve
the
double-rent
bond
on
appeal.
friedenthal
v.
thompson
involves
the
time
limitations
and
the
ability
to
raise
an
equitable
defense.
there
the
equitable
defense
plus
of
the
nature
of
asserting
oral
modification
of
a
subsequent
modification
of
a
written
lease.
topco
v.
florida,
leathers
v.
peterson,
sher
v.
williams
are
similar
types
of
cases,
but
that
is
it
and
menefee
lumber
company
versus
abrams
those
cases.
mr.
john
h.
clough
i
believe
that
is
what
he
has
implied,
but
that
is
not
the
case
under
oregon
law.
the--
mr.
john
h.
clough
those
cases
reveal
it
and
an
analysis
of
the
statute.
you
see
the
case
--
the
cases
involving
raising
an
equitable,
the
so-called
equitable
matter
do
not
operate
as
a
stay
per
se
of
the
eviction
action.
they
must
then
proceed
to
determine
whether
or
not
those,
the
issues
raised
would
operate
to
stay.
in
other
words,
the
example
of
leathers
versus
peterson,
the
question
was
whether
or
not
there
was
deed
or
a
mortgage
in
conveyance
of
the
land
near
the
parties,
we
are
dealing
of
less
than
arms
length.
there
is
a
question
of
fraud
and
the
inducement.
well,
if
did
operate
as
a
mortgage
as
opposed
to
a
deed
then
there
would
not
be
any
validity
to
using
the
fed
action.
there
would
be
another
action
that
would
have
to
be
available.
so
it
goes
to
item
four
on
the
allegations
to
complaint
and
that
is
whether
or
not
the
landlord
has
the
right
to
possession
and
what
we
are
dealing
with
is
item
three
which
explicitly
says,
if
the
rent
has
not
been
paid
within
10
days
after
it
comes
due,
that
is
it.
it
is
cut-off
right
there.
he
says
yes
but
and
no
more
defenses
in
the
oregon
courts.
it
just
seeks
if
there
are
chances
are.
mr.
john
h.
clough
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
three-judge
court’s
denial
of
injunctive
and
declaratory
relief,
sought
by
donald
and
edna
lindsey
on
behalf
of
themselves
and
the
class
of
appellants,
including
all
tenants
in
the
state
of
oregon.
the
lindsey’s
attack
to
constitutionality
of
oregon’s
eviction
law,
seeking
to
enjoin
its
enforcement
of
it
is
objectionable
provisions
by
appellee
judges.
the
lindseys
had
been
having
difficulties
in
getting
there
landlord,
appellee
normet
to
repair
the
condition
of
their
home
which
condition
included
lack
of
plaster,
downstairs
toilet
out
of
order,
missing
rear
steps,
etcetera.
since
pictures
are
better
than
words,
we
specifically
refer
the
court
to
the
color
photographs
in
evidence
marked
as
plaintiff’s
exhibits
number
25
to
37
in
the
record.
on
november
10
--
mr.
john
h.
clough
no,
they
are
not.
they
were
unable
to
print
them
because
they
were
color
photographs,
your
honor.
on
november
10,
1969,
their
home
had
been
condemned
by
the
bureau
of
building
inspections
of
the
city
of
portland
because
of
the
violation
of
portland’s
housing
and
building
codes.
since
donald
lindsey
was
substantially
confined
to
a
wheelchair
with
crippling
arthritis
of
both
arms
and
legs
and
neither
he
nor
his
wife
could
drive
a
car,
they
did
not
have
the
mobility
to
search
for
another
home.
furthermore,
their
search
would
have
been
rendered
more
difficult
by
the
factor
that
the
overall
vacancy
rate
for
portland
was
less
than
2%
and
for
low
income
families
less
than
1%.
mr.
john
h.
clough
in
some
respects
it
might
and
some
respects
it
might
not.
there
are
some
aspects
of
the
case.
mr.
john
h.
clough
yes,
some
aspects
of
the
case
would
make
a
difference
because
of
the
indigency
and
ability
to
search
for
a
home.
although,
constitutionally
–-
mr.
john
h.
clough
constitutionally,
it
would
make
no
difference.
low-income
housing
is
that
which
has
rents
within
the
financial
reach
of
a
typical
family
of
four
whose
income
is
from
$0-4,000.00
a
year.
in
portland,
an
estimated
75%
of
low
income
families
rent,
but
lindsey’s
home
was
a
low-income
home.
most
housing
available
for
low-income
families
is
quite
often
substandard
and
the
condition
is
generally
very
poor
in
portland.
low-income
people
pay
a
higher
portion
of
their
monthly
income
for
rent
and
generally
pay
higher
utility
in
heating
bills
because
of
deficiencies
in
plumbing,
insulation
and
wiring.
mr.
john
h.
clough
yes,
it
is
your
honor.
the
last
statement,
mr.
justice
blackmun
was
in
the
deposition
of
josephine
brown,
our
expert
which
is
admitted
into
evidence
and
as
plaintiff's
exhibit
number
24
at
page
26.
low-income
people
generally
have
a
difficult
time
finding
a
place
because
of
the
advance
month’s
rent
for
cleaning
deposits
often
required.
after
the
request
to
the
landlord
to
repair
these
conditions
and
no
action
was
forthcoming,
they
decided
to
attempt
to
improve
their
lot
where
they
lived
and
withheld
their
rent
on
december
1,
1969
to
compel
their
landlord
to
repair
the
premises.
mr.
john
h.
clough
the
court
had
the
option
and
the
court
preferred
--
the
tender
was
offered
at
the
institution
of
the
proceedings
and
the
court
preferred
that
we
as
their
attorneys
keep
the
money
in
our
escrow
account
and
specifically
condition
to
temporary
restraining
order
based
upon
that.
mr.
john
h.
clough
that
is
correct.
on
december
15,
1969,
they
were
sent
a
letter
from
their
landlord’s
attorney
demanding
them
to
pay
rent
or
vacate.
at
this
point,
they
were
faced
with
the
realities
of
having
an
eviction
action
filed
against
them,
pursuant
to
the
statute
under
attack
in
this
appeal.
there
was
no
question
that
an
eviction
would
cause
the
lindseys
irreparable
harm.
evictions
of
low-income
families
often
result
in
a
continuing
downward
and
tightening
spar
which
they
find
an
emotional
block
to
overcome.
they
do
not
have
the
cost
of
moving
and
they
cannot
find
housing.
they
are
often
forced
into
less
adequate
housing.
they
lose
standing
in
the
community
and
in
their
children’s
eyes
and
large
families
are
often
split
up.
in
this
background,
this
action
was
filed
in
the
federal
district
court
prior
to
any
eviction
action
being
filed
by
the
lindsey’s
landlord.
the
best
way
to
describe
the
operation
of
the
eviction
statute
is
by
taking
the
lindseys
through
their
eviction,
had
one
been
filed
by
their
landlord.
a
complaint
and
summons
would
be
filed
and
served
upon
the
lindseys,
setting
the
time
for
trial
within
two
to
four
days
which
may
include
weekends.
mr.
john
h.
clough
no.
mr.
john
h.
clough
that
is
correct.
i
am
using
the
lindseys
as
what
would
happen
to
describe
the
operation
of
the
statute.
for
example,
they
could
be
served
on
a
friday
with
a
trial
set
on
monday
or
tuesday.
however,
two
days
is
all
the
time
for
trial
that
the
tenant
has
a
matter
of
right.
within
this
time,
they
would
have
to
contact
the
lawyer,
make
an
appointment
and
get
him
to
take
the
case.
his
first
move
would
be
to
ask
for
continuance
and
all
that
he
could
get
without
posting
cash
security
would
be
two
days,
the
granting
of
which
is
only
the
discretionary
under
the
statute.
even
though
that
defenses
that
lindseys
would
like
to
raise
would
not
be
heard
by
the
oregon
courts
because
of
the
statute
he
is
challenging.
he
might
still
have
conventional
defenses
based
upon
issues
of
fact,
regarding
what
rent
was
agreed
to
or
if
it
were
truly
paid.
litigation
of
these
issues
may
well
require
interviewing
potential
witnesses,
subpoenaing
them,
legal
research
and
trial
preparation.
at
trial,
lindsey
would
want
to
raise
defenses
based
upon
his
landlord’s
refusal
to
obey
the
housing
codes,
but
these
defenses
will
not
be
heard
or
adjudicated
on
their
merits.
the
reason
for
this
is
found
on
the
face
of
the
oregon
statutes.
they
provide
that
the
landlord’s
complaint
is
sufficient
as
it
states:
(1)
a
description
of
the
premises,
(2)
that
the
defendant
is
in
possession,
(3)
that
the
defendant
unlawfully
holds
by
force
which
is
deemed
to
include
failure
to
pay
rent
within
10
days
after
it
is
due,and
(4)
that
the
landlord
is
entitled
to
possession.
the
statute
goes
on
to
provide
that
if
the
court
or
jury
finds
the
complaint
to
be
true,
the
tenants
shall
be
evicted.
thus,
these
statutes
on
their
face
preclude
the
raising
of
affirmative
legal
defenses
and
they
have
been
so
construed
by
the
oregon
courts.
mr.
john
h.
clough
the
last
time
that
the
fed,
the
eviction
law
was
changed
in
any
matter
was
in
1909,
although
the
case
of
friedenthal
v.
thompson
goes
into
a
historical
analysis
where
they
were
in
effect
back
in
the
middle
1800s.
mr.
john
h.
clough
there
has
been
an
effort
yes,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
john
h.
clough
no,
i
do
not,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
john
h.
clough
the
question
has
been
raised,
mr.
justice
blackmun
in
several
cases
that
have
gone
up
to
the
oregon
supreme
court
on
various
aspects.
so
that
for
example
friedenthal
v.
thompson
involved
the
constrictions
on
limitations
of
time.
there
were
several
cases
that
sought
to
raise
equitable
types
of
offenses
and
these
were
interpreted
by
oregon
supreme
court.
the
double
rent
bond
on
appeal
has
been
construed
by
the
oregon
supreme
court
and
been
upheld
as
constitutional.
legal
defenses
had
been
specifically
disallowed
by
the
oregon
supreme
court.
mr.
john
h.
clough
of
course,
that
would
be
a
very
welcome
response,
but
the
legislature
of
oregon
has
not
seen
as
to
do
so
and
our
--
one
of
the
main
lines
of
attack
that
we
have
here
on
the
statute
is
due
process
which
--
that
does
not
matter
that
the
statute
either
procedural
like
constricts
the
courts
and
the
litigants
so
that
the
it
dives
in
due
process
or
it
does
not.
well,
that
is
true
of
any
statute.
any
statute
could
be
changed
at
any
given
time
by
state
legislature.
under
the
oregon
statutes,
the
fact
that
the
tenant
may
would
have
withheld
rent
because
the
landlord
failed
to
make
proper
repairs
or
the
fact
that
the
landlord
brought
the
action
in
retaliation
for
the
tenant
having
recorded
code
violations
to
a
city
agency
or
complaint
to
the
landlord
or
even
the
fact
that
the
action
is
brought
because
of
the
tenant’s
raise.
those
facts
are
not
only
considered
irrelevant,
they
are
not
even
heard.
these
defenses
are
not
judged
on
their
merits.
they
are
not
even
heard
and
are
stricken.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trial,
if
the
tenant
looses
and
desires
to
remain
in
the
premises,
pending
the
appeal
to
the
circuit
court,
he
must
post
an
open-ended
double
rent
bond
to
guarantee
twice
the
amount
of
the
rent
to
be
paid
from
the
inception
of
the
action
until
final
determination
by
the
appellate
court.
mr.
john
h.
clough
not
at
all,
as
long
as
it
becomes
due.
mr.
john
h.
clough
because
of
the
indigent
tenant,
but
there
is
no
objection
to
that.
mr.
john
h.
clough
if
the
situation
is
such
--
mr.
john
h.
clough
yes,
it
is
the
case
is
what
as
such
lends
itself,
that
paying
it
to
the
landlord
would
defeat
the
whole
purpose.
mr.
john
h.
clough
that
is
true,
but
would
not,
that
action
would
not
stay
this
proceeding
and
that
the
whole
issue
here
--
mr.
john
h.
clough
not
in
an
independent
action
for
contract,
but
the
issue
here
is
possession
of
the
premises.
mr.
john
h.
clough
and
that
is
the
key
issue
that
the
tenant
is
interested
in.
mr.
john
h.
clough
by
continuing
to
pay
the
rent
of
the
landlord,
but
then
it
defeats
this
whole
purpose.
mr.
john
h.
clough
the
problem
--
the
problem
with
that
is
it
forces
every
tenant
into
litigation.
the
--
mr.
john
h.
clough
but
even
--
mr.
john
h.
clough
that
is
quite
correct.
however
--
mr.
john
h.
clough
and
you
will
also
be
separated
from
your
property,
if
the
landlord
decides
to
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
h.
clough
he
could
give
a
30-day
notice
in
retaliation
for
your
invoking
the
court
procedures
and
what
this
action
would
do,
would
force
them
to
involve
the
--
mr.
john
h.
clough
yes.
mr.
john
h.
clough
only
for
the
time
of
the
continuance.
mr.
john
h.
clough
if
he
gets
a
continuance
and
it
must
be
cash
in
advance.
in
other
words,
he
cannot
--
if
he
is
an
indigent
tenant
who
has
his
money
carefully
budgeted
he
could
not
financially
afford
to
pay
enough
to
get
a
continuance
for
two
or
three
months.
mr.
john
h.
clough
a
continuance
of
hearing,
the
possessory
action,
the
action
for
eviction.
mr.
john
h.
clough
that
would
vary
depending
on
how
much
time
he
has.
mr.
john
h.
clough
well,
presumably
under
our
situation
he
would
have
that
money
that
if
he
were
in
default
on
it
and
there
will
no
objection
to
that.
mr.
john
h.
clough
we
would
have
no
objection
to
that,
but
that
is
not
the
way
to
that
statute
operates.
mr.
john
h.
clough
you
have
to
put
up
cash
in
advance.
in
other
words,
if
he
desired
a
continuance
for
two
months,
he
would
right
then
and
there
have
to
put
up
cash
and
guarantee
it
for
two
months.
mr.
john
h.
clough
no,
it
does
not,
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
john
h.
clough
your
first
impression
was
correct.
i
thought
you
were
referring
to
the
federal
court
action.
the
court
below
opted
the
rent
escrow.
mr.
john
h.
clough
that
was
the
three-judge
court,
yes.
mr.
john
h.
clough
perfectly
reasonable
or
some
variation.
however,
the
court
felt
this
would
be
something
for
the
state
courts
to
work
out.
mr.
john
h.
clough
of
course.
mr.
john
h.
clough
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
h.
clough
yes,
we
would
have
no
problems
with
that
whatsoever.
the
double
rent
bond
on
appeal
is
in
addition
to
the
usual
cost
bond.
this
bond
may
be
filed
as
a
cash
bond,
personal
bond
or
for
maturity
bond,
in
any
event
with
two
sureties.
it
is
open
ended
and
may
last
for
a
month
or
a
year.
within
five
days
after
the
posting
of
the
bond,
the
landlord
can
require
justification
of
the
sureties
by
their
presence
in
court.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
appeal,
if
the
tenant
loses,
the
landlord
simply
executes
on
the
bond
or
if
the
money
has
been
paid
into
court,
upon
the
filing
of
the
order,
it
is
simply
dispersed.
the
landlord
collects
the
entire
amount
of
the
bond,
not
just
to
the
damages
or
expenses
if
any.
if
the
tenant
loses
at
the
circuit
court,
he
may
appeal
to
the
state
supreme
court
and
the
same
process
is
again
repeated.
we
are
challenging
the
three-major
restrictions
on
the
low-income
tenant’s
ability
to
properly
defend
himself
in
oregon.
these
are;
first,
the
short
time
to
prepare
for
trial,
(2)
the
refusal
of
the
court
to
hear
his
defenses
and
(3)
the
denial
of
his
ability
to
appeal
because
of
the
double
rent
bond
requirement.
we
contend
that
these
restrictions
violate
both
the
equal
protection
and
due
process
clauses
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
they
affect
certain
fundamental
interests
of
the
tenant.
the
first
of
these
fundamental
interests
is
his
right
to
retain
peaceful
possession
of
his
home
or
the
sanctity
of
the
home.
second,
is
his
right
to
decent
housing.
third,
his
right
to
meaningful
access
to
and
equal
treatment
in
the
courts.
while
all
of
these
interests
has
been
treated
as
fundamental
by
this
court
in
various
decisions,
the
right
to
retain
peaceful
possession
of
once
home
has
received
the
most
attention,
from
the
court
being
protected
under
the
third,
fourth,
fifth,
ninth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
for
example
in
silverman
versus
united
states
at
365
u.s.,
this
court
rejected
evidence
obtained
by
the
use
of
spiked
mike
which
intruded
several
inches
under
the
wall
of
the
defendant’s
home
as
it
would
have
obtained
by
“actual
intrusion”
into
a
constitutionally
protected
area.
in
camara
versus
municipal
court
at
387
u.s.,
this
court
held
that
a
warrant
must
be
obtained
before
homes
can
be
inspected
by
city
agencies.
and
in
rowan
versus
united
states
post
office
department,
this
court
upheld
in
the
face
of
the
first
amendment
attack,
a
statute
protecting
householders
from
junk
mail
intrusions.
if
this
court
has
found
the
sanctity
of
the
home
to
be
worthy
of
constitutional
protection
against
these
sporadic
intrusions,
how
much
more
worthy
a
protection
is
the
right
to
be
free
from
a
total
ousting
of
possession?
total
ousting
by
the
county
sheriff
is
what
faces
the
tenant
who
looses
an
eviction
action
in
oregon.
it
is
almost
inevitable
under
the
procedures
we
are
challenging.
in
addition,
certain
of
the
restrictions,
we
are
dealing
with
involve
a
suspect
classification,
one
based
upon
wealth,
since
indigent
tenants
do
not
have
the
resources
to
post
either
the
continuance
bond
or
the
double
rent
appeal
bond.
we
do
not
feel
that
we
are
asking
for
anything
unreasonable
in
this
case.
we
fully
recognize
that
there
are
certain
interests
of
the
landlord
that
the
state
of
oregon
may
reasonably
protect,
if
it
wishes
to
do
so.
the
main
interest
meant
to
be
protected
by
the
restrictions
we
are
challenging
is
the
landlord's
desire
to
see
that
he
will
not
lose
rent
money,
he
may
have
come
into
it
during
the
litigation,
that
he
eventually
might
win.
statutes
designed
to
protect
this
interest
should
be
constitutional
if
they
are
reasonable,
but
the
restrictions
involved
here
go
too
far.
they
are
unreasonable
at
the
expense
of
the
tenant’s
interests
in
protecting
his
home.
we
can
understand,
for
example,
shortening
the
time
to
prepare
for
trial
on
eviction
action
to
something
less
than
that
available
to
other
defendants.
but
only
two
days
as
a
matter
of
right
is
so
short
as
to
make
the
mockery
of
the
judicial
system.
mr.
john
h.
clough
if
that
were
20
days,
probably
not
on
that
issue.
it
would
depend
entirely
how
that
the
oregon
court
has
set
up
the
procedure.
mr.
john
h.
clough
payment
is
one.
yes
actually
--
mr.
john
h.
clough
there
are
certain
equitable
types
of
defenses
such
as
showing
that
agreement
between
the
parties
was
something
aside
from
what
its
apparent
nature
was
and
their
true
relationship
was
not
that
of
landlord-tenant
such
as,
a
deed
is
really
a
mortgage,
and
therefore,
the
eviction
procedure
should
not
be
used,
the
oregon
procedure
should
be
used
(voice
overlap).
mr.
john
h.
clough
no
those
would
still
be
landlord-tenant
and
they
will
still
be
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
h.
clough
that
the
lease,
that
there
is
in
fact
a
lease
for
year,
a
written
lease
that
may
be
it
depends
depending
on
the
circumstances
of
the
case,
but
again
we
are
dealing
with
that
fourth
item
in
the
complaint
with
landlord’s
right
to
the
possession,
not
the
third
item
which
we
are
concerned
with
raising
any
contractual
defenses.
mr.
john
h.
clough
like
the
time
is
contingent
upon
the
ability
to
raise
its
defenses
of
course.
mr.
john
h.
clough
in
theory
that
(voice
overlap)
that
would
be
available.
mr.
john
h.
clough
some
of
them,
there
is
none
filed
in
the
lindsey
case.
mr.
john
h.
clough
there
were
three
others
and
for
various
reasons
those
three
cases
settled
and
were
never
appealed.
mr.
john
h.
clough
the
case
in
controversy
is
that
he
threatened
eviction
into
invoke
the
use
of
the
courts.
mr.
john
h.
clough
but
he
never
did
because
of
this
action.
mr.
john
h.
clough
because
there
was
a
restraining
order
issue
in
this
action.
mr.
john
h.
clough
not
in
the
fact
situation
mr.
chief
justice
that
you
gave
to
me.
mr.
john
h.
clough
he
would
have
no
defense.
mr.
john
h.
clough
however,
if
he
were
raising
the
defense
that
he
should
be
entitled
to
at
least
raise
and
be
heard
on
a
defense
that
the
landlord
is
evicting
for
example
in
retaliation,
puts
testimony
in,
but
that
is
not
the
fact
--
mr.
john
h.
clough
of
course,
there
is
no
denial
of
due
process
because
the
defense
has
not
been
raised.
mr.
john
h.
clough
yes,
but
the
statute
is
over
inclusive
because
it
includes
all
of
these
other
situations
too.
there
is
no
differentiating
between
that
type
of
situation
and
the
type
of
situation
where
the
tenant
seeks
to
raise
retaliatory
eviction
as
a
defense.
mr.
john
h.
clough
it
would
be
on
its
face
because
the
statute
is
over
inclusive
on
its
face.
mr.
john
h.
clough
it
might
be
merged
to
both,
yes.
i
like
to
reserve
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
h.
clough
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
just
few
comments.
contrary
to
the
apprehensions
here
that
had
been
cast,
we
still
need
time
to
prepare
for
conventional
defenses
and
we
still
maintain
that
the
two-day
time
limit
as
a
matter
of
right
is
too
short
to
even
prepare
for
those
such
as
to
find
out
the
issues
as
to
what
rent
is
agreed
to.
they
may
need
witnesses
to
testify
as
to
whether
or
not
rent
is
in
fact
been
paid
or
whether
rent
receipts
are
available
and
in
connection
with
that,
the
attorney
still
has
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
there
is
in
fact
a
valid
defense
and
he
needs
more
time
in
order
to
do
that.
the
third
point
is
regarding
the
joining
of
the
action
for
rent
and
fed
under
--
in
our
brief
at
page
48
footnote
13,
we
have
cited
two
statutory
provisions
which
provide
that
the
action
for
rent
can
be
joined
with
an
fed,
but
at
that
point
the
case
is
severed
and
the
action
for
rent
proceeds
as
any
other
lawsuit
with
the
fed
proceeding
close
forward.
the
fourth
point
is
the
--
i
would
refer
the
court
to
plaintiff’s
exhibit
number
14
which
is
the
letter
sent
to
the
lindseys
by
the
normet’s
attorney.
it
speaks
for
itself
regarding
whether
not
it
threatens
eviction.
essentially,
all
that
appellants
are
asking
for
is
a
chance
to
be
able
to
change
the
law
in
oregon.
we
do
not
ask
this
court
to
change
any
substantive
rule
of
law.
that
is
for
the
courts
of
oregon
to
do
and
that
is
for
them
to
use
the
principles
of
the
common
law
and
develop,
we
will
seek
to
have
them
adopt
the
consumer
protection
principles
that
have
been
analogize
to
landlord-
tenant
law
in
other
jurisdictions
which
they
are
free
to
do
absent
the
statute
so
we
are
essentially
asking
for
chance.
mr.
john
h.
clough
you
mean
by
a
construction
of
the
statute?
there
is
no
construction
of
the
statute
that
the
statute
is
very
explicit
it
says
to
--
mr.
john
h.
clough
whatever
reasonable
enough
period
of
time
in
order
to
--
mr.
john
h.
clough
oh!
yes.
mr.
john
h.
clough
on
the
time
limitation.
mr.
john
h.
clough
on
the
time
limitations,
that
would
be
true.
mr.
john
h.
clough
no,
it
would
not
dissolve
this
whole
case.
mr.
john
h.
clough
that
the
ability
to
raise
defenses
would
still
remain
and
the
double-rent
bond
on
appeal
and
the
continuance
bond.
those
issues
are
still
in
this
case
no
matter
what
happens
to
the
time
limitations
because
you
still
have
the
constrictions
of
the
statute
that
would
apply,
no
matter
whether
he
had
10
days,
50
days
or
2
days.
mr.
john
h.
clough
it
is
an
open-ended
bond,
mr.
justice.
it
is
for
no
specified
amount.
it
is
a
virtual
impossibility
to
obtain
a
surety
bond.
surety
bond
companies
just
would
not
write
them.
mr.
john
h.
clough
we
have
the
oregon
cases
that
are
listed
in
the
brief,
scales
v.
spencer
and
priester
v.
thrall
specifically
dealing
with
the
double-rent
bond
on
appeal
and
describe
how
it
operates.
the
other
types
of
cases
are
appeals
that
have
been
taken,
but
quite
effectively
it
does
preclude
almost
any
right
to
appeal
and
most
of
those
cases
involve
commercial
leases,
not
residential
leases.
mr.
john
h.
clough
scales
v.
spencer,
priester
v.
thrall
involve
the
double-rent
bond
on
appeal.
friedenthal
v.
thompson
involves
the
time
limitations
and
the
ability
to
raise
an
equitable
defense.
there
the
equitable
defense
plus
of
the
nature
of
asserting
oral
modification
of
a
subsequent
modification
of
a
written
lease.
topco
v.
florida,
leathers
v.
peterson,
sher
v.
williams
are
similar
types
of
cases,
but
that
is
it
and
menefee
lumber
company
versus
abrams
those
cases.
mr.
john
h.
clough
i
believe
that
is
what
he
has
implied,
but
that
is
not
the
case
under
oregon
law.
the--
mr.
john
h.
clough
those
cases
reveal
it
and
an
analysis
of
the
statute.
you
see
the
case
--
the
cases
involving
raising
an
equitable,
the
so-called
equitable
matter
do
not
operate
as
a
stay
per
se
of
the
eviction
action.
they
must
then
proceed
to
determine
whether
or
not
those,
the
issues
raised
would
operate
to
stay.
in
other
words,
the
example
of
leathers
versus
peterson,
the
question
was
whether
or
not
there
was
deed
or
a
mortgage
in
conveyance
of
the
land
near
the
parties,
we
are
dealing
of
less
than
arms
length.
there
is
a
question
of
fraud
and
the
inducement.
well,
if
did
operate
as
a
mortgage
as
opposed
to
a
deed
then
there
would
not
be
any
validity
to
using
the
fed
action.
there
would
be
another
action
that
would
have
to
be
available.
so
it
goes
to
item
four
on
the
allegations
to
complaint
and
that
is
whether
or
not
the
landlord
has
the
right
to
possession
and
what
we
are
dealing
with
is
item
three
which
explicitly
says,
if
the
rent
has
not
been
paid
within
10
days
after
it
comes
due,
that
is
it.
it
is
cut-off
right
there.
he
says
yes
but
and
no
more
defenses
in
the
oregon
courts.
it
just
seeks
if
there
are
chances
are.
