mr.
clough,
how
old
are
the
oregon
statutes?
how
long
had
they
been
on
the
books?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
has
there
been
any
endeavor
to
change
the
statute
legislatively?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
just
wonder
if
one
could
say
that
possession
of
the
premises
during
the
controversy
such
as
you
envision
here
with
the
lindsey’s
is
a
matter
at
issue
and
that
your
legislature
has
come
down
on
the
side
of
the
landlord
rather
than
the
side
of
the
tenant
in
deciding
a
policy
question?
i
take
it
you
do
not
agree
with
that?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
do
you
for
the
first
time
in
the
century
are
raising
question?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
of
course
you
could
have
resolved
this
dilemma
by
appropriate
legislation,
could
you
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
happened
in
this
case
though?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
was
in
the
federal
court.
