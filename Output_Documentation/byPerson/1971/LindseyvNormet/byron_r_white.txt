justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
object
to
paying
in
the
court
the
rent
while
the
action
is
going
on?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
do
object
to
paying
it
to
the
landlord?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
what
the
case
is
all
about,
i
guess?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
could
sue
the
landlord
in
an
independent
action
on
an
attempt
to
collect
for
breach
of
the
lease
or
something?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
are
not
giving
as
rights
under
the
oregon
law,
you
do
not
give
up
any
right
to
sue
the
landlord
in
you
own
action,
i
gather?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
can
retain
possession
by
paying
the
rent
to
the
landlord?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
does
defeat
anything
if
you
--
what
does
it
defeat,
if
you
can
nevertheless
recover
what
you
paid
in
the
possession?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
that,
but
you
concede
that
pending
litigation
you
have
to
pay
the
rent
anyway?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
pay
in
the
court.
you
are
not
keeping
the
money.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
paying
the
money,
you
are
being
separated
from
the
rent
as
it
falls
due
and
you
are
going
to
be
separated
from
it
as
long
as
the
issue
between
you
and
the
landlord
is
settled?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
as
long
as
you
pay
the
rent
in
the
court,
you
are
not
being
dispossessed?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
have
seen
--
if
i
do
not
understand
when
the
landlord
brings
this
action,
this
forcible
entry
and
detainer
action
against
the
tenant?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
the
tenant
can
retain
possession
if
he
pays
rent
in
the
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
mean
get
a
continuance?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
he
actually
have
to
put
out
to
get
the
continuance?
how
much
money?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
he
does
not
have
any
money
that
any
rent
that
he
is
in
default
on
in
the
first
place?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
his
rent
falls
due,
he
would
have
to
put
up
the
money?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
how
does
it
operate?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
i
ask
you
if
the,
in
the
fed
suit
in
response
to
it,
you
could
not
only
claim
that
you
are
not
in
default,
but
that
the
statute
itself
is
unconstitutional
and
have
--
get
a
constitutional
decision
in
that
case
and
if
you
did
afford
the
appeal
bond,
appeal
any
rejection
of
your
constitutional
ground?
justice
byron

well,

not?

if
the
case
of
controversy
between
the
one
person
in
that
landlord,l
had
he
threatened
the
eviction
or
what?
justice

but
he
never
did?
justice
