those

are
in

justice
potter
stewart
but
this
did
not
actually
happen
to
the
lindseys?
justice
potter
stewart
they
filed
this
action
to
the
district
court
before
alleging
that
they
were
threatened
with
this,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
are
the
defenses
available
under
the
oregon
system
just
that
payment
is
one,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
is
anything
else?
justice
potter
stewart
or
that
what
appears
to
be
a
tenancy
at
will;
might
be
month-to-month
or
what
appears
to
be
a
month-to-month
might
be
an
actual
lease
for
a
year
or
something
like
that?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
available
as
a
defense
that,
is
what
i
mean?
justice
potter
stewart
my
thought
was
that
it
cannot
be
both
ways.
in
other
words,
you
say
on
one
hand
that
oregon
does
not
allow
you
to
make
any
real
defenses
and
on
the
other
that
you
should
be
given
more
time
to
make
defenses.
well,
if
there
are
no
defenses
to
be
made,
like
the
time
is
not
a
very
--
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understand
it,
under
oregon
law
the
landlord
is
not
permitted
to
join
with
fed
complaint,
any
other
claim
eg
a
claim
for
the
payment
background
or
anything,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
but
then
if
he
does?
justice
potter
stewart
it
becomes
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
becomes
just
like
any
other
contract
action?
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
plaintiff
joined
anything
except
the
eviction?
justice
potter
stewart
then
defenses
would
be
available
and
it
would
become
an
ordinary
lawsuit?
justice
potter
stewart
this
summary
procedure
will
no
longer
take
place?
justice
potter
stewart
you
said
that
personal
service
is
required
in
oregon?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
amicus
brief,
everybody
all
talked
about
the
so-called
sewer
service
because
i
gather
in
many
states
a
service
by
attaching
the
process
to
the
door
of
the
house
is
something
that
is
sufficient
and
process
servers
often
find
it
more
convenient
to
do
that,
but
actually
(voice
overlap)
up
down
the
sewer.
i
wonder
if
the
failure
to
make
personal
service
would
be
a
defense
in
this
action?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
i
suppose
if
that
defendant
comes
into
court,
he
is
uttered
an
appearance,
so
instead
of
(voice
overlap)
in
order
to
make
that
defense
he
would
to
have
his
special
appearance,
would
he?
justice
potter
stewart
because
there
was
no
personal
service?
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
happens
if
for
want
of
personal
service,
the
tenant
never
did
have
an
actual
notice
to
this
proceeding,
then
what
happens?
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
defendant
were
absent
outside
the
state,
you
would
not
need
to
bring
an
eviction
proceeding,
would
you?
justice
potter
stewart
and
those
defenses
would
mainly
be
whether
or
nor
he
paid
the
rent
(voice
overlap)
would
that
not
be
99%?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
jensen,
judge
goodwin
in
his
opinion
for
this
three-judge
district
court
referred
to
this
appeal
on
provision
as
the
to
quote
him
“perhaps
the
most
difficult
question
in
this
case”
and
the
statute
provides
for
the
posting
of
the
bond
for
double
the
amount
of
rent
that
will
accrue
pending
the
appeal.
how
can
you
tell,
how
much
that
will
be?
how
can
you
tell
how
long
the
appeal
will
take?
how
in
actual
operation
does
this
work?
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
sort
of
making
an
estimate
as
to
how
long
the
appeal
would
take
and
then
it
is
going
to
be
increased
or
decreased,
depending
on
how
fast
things
go?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
generally
just
sort
of
an
arbitrary
estimate
of
three
months
or
four
months
or
five
months
or
do
you
not
know?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
the
tenant
loses
the
appeal,
does
the
appellee
landlord
automatically
get
payment
of
the
full
amount
of
that?
justice
potter
stewart
can
it
or
any
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
this
can
be
waived
by
the
court?
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
by
the
court,
can
he

justice
potter
stewart
in
view
of
the
explicit
statutory
bond?
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
know
how
this
double-rent
bond
on
appeal
actually
works
in
practice?
justice
potter

how
many
appeals
have
there
been
and
how
many

justice

what
are
the
others?
