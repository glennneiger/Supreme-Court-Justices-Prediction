mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
i
am
appearing
here
for
the
defendant,
mrs.
normet.
the
factual
situation
in
the
case
actually
as
we
see
it
was
that
mrs.
normet
was
the
record
owner
of
the
property,
but
had
become
so
with
an
outstanding
contract
of
sale
on
the
property
to
a
party
who
had
in
turn
rented
the
property
to
the
lindseys.
when
mrs.
normet
on
default
on
this
contract
under
which
the
property
had
been
sold
and
more
or
less
had
been
abandoned
by
the
contract
purchaser.
mrs.
normet
had
begin
to
collect
and
she
did
receive
the
rent
payments
from
the
lindseys
up
through
november,
applied
them
on
the
contract
of
sale
and
commenced
a
suit
to
foreclose
the
contract
in
order
to
clear
up
the
title
of
the
property.
then
in
november,
the
city
of
portland,
under
its
housing
code,
notified
both
the
lindseys,
they
being
the
tenants
and
mrs.
normet
that
the
property
was
substandard
in
a
good
many
respects
and
posted
a
notice
that
the
property
be
vacated
or
the
repairs
made.
at
that
point
mrs.
normet
through
her
attorney
gave
a
notice
to
the
lindseys
requesting
them
to
vacate
the
property
in
accordance
with
order
of
the
city
of
portland.
she
not
wanting
to
go
ahead
and
spend
the
money
which
would
be
required
to
make
the
repairs
because
of
the
existing
cloud
on
the
title
of
the
property
at
that
particular
time.
now,
the
trial
court
made
a
finding
that
there
was
a
landlord-tenant
relationship
between
mrs.
normet
and
the
lindsey’s
and
treated
it
as
though
it
were
an
ordinary
landlord-tenant
relationship.
in
this
case,
we
view
the
summary
of
the
argument
and
briefs
of
the
appellant
that
they
are
saying
on
two
grounds
that
the
oregon
eviction
statutes
are
unconstitutional
because
they
do
not
grant
equal
protection
and
due
process
at
law
and
that
it
deprived
tenants
of
rights
and
privileges
afforded
to
them
in
the
civil
eviction
actions
in
oregon
by
denying
basic
rights
needed
to
enable
them
to
receive
fundamentally
fair
hearings
on
their
defenses.
now,
i
would
like
first
of
all
to
direct
my
remarks
to
the
oregon
eviction
law
briefly.
first
of
all,
the
oregon
eviction
law
is
only
available
or
is
only
used
when
there
exist
a
landlord-tenant
relationship.
it
does
not
apply
in
any
other
situation.
it
protects,
our
position
is
that
it
protects
all
tenants
equally.
it
does
not
make
any
distinction
as
to
what
their
funds
may
be
that
they
have
available
to
them
whether
they
are
rich
or
poor.
it
just
applies
and
gives
equal
protection
to
all
tenants.
if
the
tenants,
first
of
all,
we
have
no
self-help
procedure
in
oregon
that
is
where
the
landlord
can
go
in
and
evict
the
tenant
himself.
if
he
wants
to
evict
a
tenant
from
the
property
he
has
to
go
in
to
the
court
and
get
a
determination
that
he
has
the
right
to
take
possession
from
the
tenant.
he
can
do
this,
if
the
tenant
has
failed
to
pay
the
rent
within
10
days
after
due
or
if
the
tenant’s
lease
has
expired
and
the
tenant
has
refused
to
get
out
or
if
the
tenant’s
month-to-month
or
what
tenancy
or
whatever
the
term
is
has
been
terminated
upon
either
30
days
notice
or
if
it
is
a
longer
tenancy
where
than
on
a
notice
equivalent
to
the
term
and
then
if
a
tenant
refuses
to
vacate,
the
landlord
must
in
order
to
have
a
determination
then
of
his
right
to
take
possession,
he
must
go
in
and
file
a
complaint
in
court,
setting
forth,
it
is
kind
of
a
notice
sort
of
a
complaint,
at
least
the
equivalent
of
the
federal
rules
requirements,
in
which
he
in
effect
says
that
the
tenant
is
withholding
the
premises
unlawfully
and
with
force
and
that
the
landlord
is
entitled
to
possession.
that
is
the
only
issue
in
the
fed
case
at
that
point
in
the
complaint.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
mr.
justice
that
is
correct
and
if
he
does
join,
he
can
join
an
action
for
rent
if
he
wishes
to
do
so
or
for
any
other
action
that
might
be
joinable
under
our
statute.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
but
if
he
does
then
the
fed
procedure
is
not
followed,
the
summary
procedure
is
not
followed
--
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
--
and
the
case
is
subject
to
the
ordinary
trial
of
procedure
and
instead
of
a
the
two
to
four
days
for
which
the
summons
would
state,
it
would
be
10
days
observed
in
the
county,
20
days
in
any
other
county
where
the
individual
did
not
actually
reside.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
yes,
sir
and
in
any
and
all
defenses,
including
counter
claims,
could
be
raise
then
in
the
action.
i
would
say
--
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
yes,
that
is
correct.
i
understand
--
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
yes.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
as
a
matter
of
practice,
in
most
fed
cases
the
simple
landlord-tenant
relationship
of
rental
of
a
residence
on
a
month-to-month
basis
file
just
for
possession
without
joining
any
rent
or
any
other
cause
of
action
with
it.
now,
i
think
the
court
should
realize
that
the
fed
eviction
laws
of
oregon
apply
not
only
to
the
rental
of
residences,
but
it
applies
and
is
available
and
used
in
connection
with
commercial
properties
where
there
is
a
lease
for
example
and
the
tenant
has
refused
to
vacate
at
the
end
of
the
lease
with
most
leasers
providing
that
if
they
hold
over
at
the
end
of
the
term,
then
they
are
month-to-month
tenants,
then
you
will
have
to
give
a
30-day
notice
and
bring
your
fed
action.
but
you
can
see
that
in
cases
involving
commercial
property
where
the
tenant
may
find
a
tremendous
financial
advantage
to
him
to
remain
in
a
particular
property
for
another
year
or
so,
it
would
be
a
unfair
to
permit
him
to
stay
in
just
by
continuing
to
pay
his
rent
if
the
landlord
has
given
him
the
30
days
notice
and
his
lease
term
is
over.
now,
we
have
personal
service
in
oregon
of
the
summons
in
complaint
on
the
tenant
and
the
summons
provides
that
the
matter
will
come
before
the
court
and
the
return
made
from
two
to
four
days,
the
day
of
service
is
not
counted.
so,
it
comes
up
then
before
the
court
at
that
time.
there
need
not
be
any
written
answer
filed.
we
have
procedure
in
the
oregon
law
which
grants
to
the
defendant
tenant
two
more
days
continuance
for
without
any
showing
of
any
kind.
he
can
have
an
additional
two
days
continuance
and
then
if
that
is
not
a
sufficient
amount
and
he
wishes
to
have
a
further
continuance
that
can
be
obtained
by
posting
security
for
the
payment
of
his
rent.
that
may
--
to
cover
the
period
of
the
time
for
the
continuance
that
he
wants,
in
other
words,
the
practical
aspect
of
that
is
that
he
does
not
have
to
go
back
and
pay
his
delinquent
rent,
that
is
not
an
issue
in
the
case.
it
is
possession
and
if
he
wants
to
remain
in
possession
and
get
a
continuance
of
the
case
for
more
time
for
preparation
or
for
whatever
the
reason
may
be,
he
can
do
so
from
a
practical
aspect
by
paying
the
month’s
rent
and
that
would
give
him
a
30-day
extension
of
time.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
there
is
no
provision,
mr.
chief
justice
for
the
payment
of
the
rent
into
court.
i
assume
that
the
trial
court
could
make
that
provision.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
i
believe
that
it
would
be.
it
has
not
been
the
practice
in
oregon
particularly.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
no,
it
did
not.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
and
the
thing
about
this
case
is
that
there
was
no
fed
eviction
commenced
by
mrs.
normet
against
the
lindseys.
the
claim
here
is
that
mrs.
normet
has
threatened
commencing
an
eviction
case
against
them
but
there
actually
was
no
case
filed.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
we
have
--
i
think
that
a
counsel
would
agree
with
me
that
we
have
a
different
interpretation
of
the
notice
that
was
sent
by
mrs.
normet’s
attorney
to
the
lindseys.
it
appears
it
was
a
letter.
it
appears
in
appendix.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
it
is
an
exhibit.
that
is
not
in
the
--
it
is
an
exhibit
in
the
case.
it
is
exhibit
number
14.
the
appellee’s
interpretation
of
the
letter
was
that
it
was
a
notice
or
demand
or
request
for
the
lindseys
to
comply
with
the
order
issued
by
the
city
of
portland
building
department
for
the
premises
to
be
vacated
because
it
was
substandard.
either
party
made
it,
mr.
justice.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
yes,
it
is.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
yes,
it
would
be
now,
i
would
say
--
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
yes,
he
could
under
a
special
appearance
to
quash
the
service
and
we
have
no
--
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
yes,
to
quash
whatever
the
service
was
and
it
would
--
he
can
reserve
that
by
making
a
special
--
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
well,
we
have
the
service
in
the
fed
case,
is
the
same
as
in
any
other
action
in
the
state
of
oregon
(voice
overlap).
we
have
personal
service
but
you
can
have
substituted
service
by
publishing,
there
could
be
a
publishing
which
if
the
person
is
concealed
within
the
state
or
is
outside
the
state
and
his
location
is
not
known,
but
in
support
of
that
there
would
have
to
be
an
affidavit,
prepared
and
filed
which
contained
facts,
sufficient
to
show
that
there
had
been
a
reasonable
search
made
for
the
party
before
the
publication
of
the
summons.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
well,
depending
on
had
he
left
some
of
his
belongings
in
the
property
perhaps
or
something
of
that
nature,
you
might
be
taking
a
chance
to
go
in
and
have
self-help
taking
possession
of
the
property,
but
the
service
is
no
different
in
the
fed
eviction
case
in
oregon
than
it
is
in
any
other
case.
so
we
do
not
have
what
is
called
conspicuous
service
or
so-called
sewer
service
as
i
notice
in
the
amicus
curiae
briefs,
they
have
in
new
york
and
florida.
we
do
not
have
that.
we
require
personal
service.
now,
either
party
can
request
and
have
a
jury
trial
and
if
the
tenant
and
that
is
to
determine
the
possession
and
the
tenant
can
interpose
defenses
which
are
relevant
to
the
question
of
possession.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
that
would
be
a
payment
of
rent
or
that
he
has
a
lease
on
the
property.
he
has
not
been
given
notice,
things
of
that
nature
which
are
relevant
to
the
possession.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
the
oregon
eviction
procedure
does
not
deprive
either
the
tenant
or
the
landlord
of
the
right
to
assert
other
claims
they
may
have
under
the
general
court
procedure
which
is
available
to
all.
in
other
words,
they
have
open
to
them
the
general
court
procedure
for
litigating
any
other
claims
that
they
may
have
against
each
other
arising
out
of
the
rent
agreement
or
the
rent
contract.
now,
the
appellants
seem
to
argue
here
that
all
defendants
should
be
treated
equally
and
that
it
is
wrong
to
have
a
separate
eviction
procedure
to
determine
possession
of
rented
property
between
the
landlord
and
tenant.
in
support
of
that,
they
compare
a
mortgage
foreclosure
case
with
an
fed
case
under
the
oregon
law
and
then
say
that
since
the
procedure
is
different
that
the
tenant
defendants
in
a
fed
case
do
not
receive
equal
protection
or
the
same
protection
as
an
owner
of
real
property
whose
mortgages
being
foreclosed
and
claim
that
therefore
the
eviction
or
fed
procedure
is
unconstitutional.
certainly
there
is
a
vast
difference
between
the
owner
of
real
property
who
is
delinquent
in
the
payment
of
a
mortgage
and
a
tenant
who
does
not
pay
his
rent.
it
seems
to
me,
that
we
certainly
would
not
require
a
landlord,
first
to
obtain
a
judgment
for
the
rent
and
then
hold
some
sort
of
a
judicial
sale
to
evict
the
tenant,
terminating
his
right
to
possession
of
the
property
perhaps
even
with
some
redemption
rights
following
the
order
have
some
sort
of
a
strict
foreclosure
proceeding
which
would
grant
the
tenant
some
period
of
time
to
pay
up
his
delinquency
before
the
landlord
could
retake
possession
of
his
property
from
a
defaulting
tenant.
i
submit
that
the
summary
eviction
procedures
justify
because
of
the
intending
rights
existing
in
a
landlord-tenant
relationship
and
the
oregon
eviction
law
grants
equal
protection
to
all
landlord
and
tenants.
the
state
of
oregon
has
the
right
to
establish
by
legislative
enactment
a
summary
procedure
to
determine
the
issue
of
possession
between
landlords
and
tenants
and
that
is
what
it
has
done
with
its
statute
and
laws.
now,
i
would
like
to
make
a
comment
or
two
with
regard
to
the
amicus
curiae
briefs
that
were
filed
in
this
case
primarily
to
make
the
point
that
the
oregon
eviction
laws
do
provide
due
process
to
tenants
in
compliance
with
the
united
states
constitution.
first
of
all,
we
have
no
self-help
provision
in
oregon
for
the
landlord
as
there
are
in
arkansas
and
arizona
under
their
unlawful
detainer
statutes
which
require
some
sort
of
a
bond
from
the
tenant
to
keep
possession
prior
to
trial.
before
the
landlord
in
oregon
can
take
any
steps
towards
recovering
possession
he
has
to
file
and
commence
a
case
in
court
under
the
eviction
statute,
filing
a
complaint.
we
do
not
have
what
is
called
conspicuous
service
or
so-called
sewer
service
in
oregon
as
they
apparently
have
in
new
york
and
florida.
oregon
requires
personal
service
or
the
same
service
as
in
any
other
litigation
in
the
oregon
courts.
we
do
not
permit
an
oral
complaint
as
in
kentucky.
oregon
requires
a
written
complaint
filed
in
a
summons
issue
and
we
permit
continuances.
we
do
not
refuse
to
grant
a
continuance
as
in
new
hampshire.
oregon
grants
a
two-day
continuance
without
any
cause
on
request
and
an
unlimited
continuance
if
security
posted
for
the
rent
which
may
be
found
due
during
the
continuance
period.
in
other
words,
you
can
pay
rent,
pay
your
current
rent
and
get
a
30-day
continuance.
in
kentucky,
it
permits,
in
amicus
curiae
brief,
there
is
a
statement
that
there
is
the
trial
as
before
the
court
not
presided
over
by
judges.
oregon
courts
are
all
presided
over
by
legally
trained
judges
and
jury
trial
on
request.
oregon
does
not
allow
in
the
fed
eviction,
the
landlord
to
recover
both
possessions
and
judgment
of
money
damages
as
in
the
california
and
new
hampshire
states.
in
oregon,
if
you
join
the
rent
claim
or
any
other
claim
that
you
have
then
you
have
to
make
the
usual
service
as
you
would
in
other
cases
and
it
proceeds
accordingly.
oregon
in
some
states
in
referring
primarily
to
california
observed
from
the
amicus
curiae
brief
that
they
allow
the
fed,
the
eviction
procedure
to
be
used
by
the
purchaser
at
an
execution
mortgage
foreclosure
to
recover
possession,
i
suppose
after
the
sale
of
the
property
at
sheriff
sale,
if
the
former
owner
does
not
voluntarily
surrender
possession
of
the
property.
and
they
also
allow
it
to
be
used
to
recover
possession
under
and
after
a
trustee's
sale
under
a
trustee’s
deed
to
evict
the
former
owner.
oregon
has
no
such
statute.
our
eviction
statute
is
related
and
confined
entirely
to
the
landlord-tenant
relationship.
oregon
does
not
deny
defenses
to
be
raised
in
eviction
proceedings
as
in
arizona.
we
permit
in
oregon
equitable
defenses,
relevant
to
the
right
of
possession
are
allowed.
oregon
does
not
require
a
bond
to
appeal
covering
the
past,
present,
and
future
rent
as
in
vermont
and
new
york.
the
bond
in
oregon
on
appeal,
the
tenant
wishes
to
remain
in
possession
is
for
twice
the
rental
value
only
for
the
period
--
only
for
the
period
from
commencement
of
action
to
final
judgment.
also,
and
--
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
the
purpose
of
that
is
stated
in
the
case
of
scales
versus
spencer
decided
by
the
oregon
supreme
court
in
1967,
in
which
it
said
that
in
as
much
as
a
final
judgment
for
restitution
could
not
include
a
judgment
for
rent,
pending
appeal,
it
appears
obvious
that
the
legislative
purpose
for
requiring
this
particular
bond
on
appeal
was
the
guarantee
that
the
rent
pending
on
appeal
would
be
paid.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
that
the
bond
must
provide
for
double
the
rental
value
was
no
doubt
intended
to
prevent
frivolous
appeals
for
the
purpose
of
delay.
if
there
were
not
some
added
cost
or
restriction,
every
ousted
tenant
would
appeal
regardless
of
the
justification.
it
can
also
be
assumed
that
the
additional
payment
would
compensate
for
ways
or
is
in
lieu
of
damages
or
the
unlawful
holding
over.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
no,
there
is
not
mr.
justice.
if
the
tenant
wants
to
appeal
and
remain
in
possession
then
the
oregon
eviction
law
provides
for
the
double
rent
bond.
if
he
surrenders
possession
and
wants
to
appeal
which
was
done
in
the
priester-thrall
case
which
is
cited
in
the
briefs,
then
he
does
not
have
to
put
up
the
double
rent
bond.
he
would
put
up
the
bond
provided
for
in
the
usual
undertaking
section
of
the
oregon
statute
which
would
be
for
--
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
cost
and
disbursements
and
any
damages
that
might
be
incurred
in
the
nature
of
waste
i
think.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
i
think
that
it
would
discourage
frivolous
appeals
and
i
suppose
as
the
appellants
here
claiming
that
--
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
well,
we
have
a
supersedeas
bond
which
is
in
damage
cases
if
you
want
to
stay
the
execution
of
any
judgment
or
you
have
to
put
up
a
supersedeas
bond.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
yes,
it
is
but
--
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
yes,
our
position
with
regard
to
that
is
that
to
permit
the
tenant
to
remain
in
possession
by
just
continuing
to
pay
just
the
rent
would
mean
that
he
could
stay
in
for
a
year
probably
or
longer
depending
on
how
long
it
took
the
case
to
progress
through
the
courts
and
that
would
point
out
that
he
could
do
that,
if
the
landlord,
now
this
applies,
the
eviction
procedure
applies
not
just
to
delinquent
rent
cases,
but
it
applies
where
the
landlord
might
want
to
take
the
property
will
say
off
the
market.
maybe
he
has
other
use
that
he
wishes
to
put
to
the
property
to.
maybe
he
wants
to
have
it
occupied
by
some
member
of
his
own
family.
in
other
words,
our
position
is
that
there
are
rights
in
the
landlord
in
his
properties
and
he
is
entitled
to
that
protection
and
if
you
do
not
preserve
or
protect
the
rights
of
a
landlord
then
you
would
be
depriving
him
of
his
property
rights
without
some
due
process.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
well,
i
do
not
that
you
could
actually
tell.
the
court
then
would
have
to
set
the
amount
of
bond
which
is
what
is
generally
done.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
well,
generally
that
is
not
the
case.
it
is
generally
fixed
and
that
goes
on
in
connection
with
the
appeal.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
i
am
not
certain
of
that
because
there
have
not
been
very
many
appeals.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
on
other
cases?
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
what
kind
of
a
bond?
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
it
can
be
--
no,
it
can
be
a
personal
--
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
--
or
a
surety
bond.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
well,
the
landlord
would
have
a
right
to
question
the
sureties
or
if
it
is
a
personal
surety
and
if
they
could
not
justify
by
showing
that
they
have
twice
the
property
equal
to
twice
the
value
of
the
bond
over
and
above
property
exempt
from
execution
or
then
the
court
would
not
approve
those
sureties.
but
it
is
up
to
the
court
and
in
many
cases
the
court
the
answering
party
questions,
would
question
the
sureties,
if
they
are
personal
sureties,
but
that
does
not
mean
that
he
would
have
a
right
to
discredit
them
if
they
qualified.
that
would
be
up
to
the
court.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
that
is
the
theory
of
the
eviction
statute
and
the
bond.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
that
is
correct.
he
would
not
collect
any
rent
and
he
would
be
being
deprived
of
the
possession
of
the
property
and
it
is
sort
of
liquidated
damage
amount,
is
the
way
that
it
is
treated
and
viewed.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
it
could
be
waived
by
the
parties.
i
do
not
believe
--
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
--
the
court
it
could
not
--
i
do
not
believe
the
court
would
have
the
right
to
waive
the
point
of
bond.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
if
the
tenant
surrenders
possession
or
then
he
can
go
ahead
--
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
(voice
overlap)
appeal.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
no,
he
would
only
get
the
amount
which
has
accrued
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
up
to
the
time
of
the
termination
of
the
case.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
that
is
my
understanding
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
yes.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
i
am
appearing
here
for
the
defendant,
mrs.
normet.
the
factual
situation
in
the
case
actually
as
we
see
it
was
that
mrs.
normet
was
the
record
owner
of
the
property,
but
had
become
so
with
an
outstanding
contract
of
sale
on
the
property
to
a
party
who
had
in
turn
rented
the
property
to
the
lindseys.
when
mrs.
normet
on
default
on
this
contract
under
which
the
property
had
been
sold
and
more
or
less
had
been
abandoned
by
the
contract
purchaser.
mrs.
normet
had
begin
to
collect
and
she
did
receive
the
rent
payments
from
the
lindseys
up
through
november,
applied
them
on
the
contract
of
sale
and
commenced
a
suit
to
foreclose
the
contract
in
order
to
clear
up
the
title
of
the
property.
then
in
november,
the
city
of
portland,
under
its
housing
code,
notified
both
the
lindseys,
they
being
the
tenants
and
mrs.
normet
that
the
property
was
substandard
in
a
good
many
respects
and
posted
a
notice
that
the
property
be
vacated
or
the
repairs
made.
at
that
point
mrs.
normet
through
her
attorney
gave
a
notice
to
the
lindseys
requesting
them
to
vacate
the
property
in
accordance
with
order
of
the
city
of
portland.
she
not
wanting
to
go
ahead
and
spend
the
money
which
would
be
required
to
make
the
repairs
because
of
the
existing
cloud
on
the
title
of
the
property
at
that
particular
time.
now,
the
trial
court
made
a
finding
that
there
was
a
landlord-tenant
relationship
between
mrs.
normet
and
the
lindsey’s
and
treated
it
as
though
it
were
an
ordinary
landlord-tenant
relationship.
in
this
case,
we
view
the
summary
of
the
argument
and
briefs
of
the
appellant
that
they
are
saying
on
two
grounds
that
the
oregon
eviction
statutes
are
unconstitutional
because
they
do
not
grant
equal
protection
and
due
process
at
law
and
that
it
deprived
tenants
of
rights
and
privileges
afforded
to
them
in
the
civil
eviction
actions
in
oregon
by
denying
basic
rights
needed
to
enable
them
to
receive
fundamentally
fair
hearings
on
their
defenses.
now,
i
would
like
first
of
all
to
direct
my
remarks
to
the
oregon
eviction
law
briefly.
first
of
all,
the
oregon
eviction
law
is
only
available
or
is
only
used
when
there
exist
a
landlord-tenant
relationship.
it
does
not
apply
in
any
other
situation.
it
protects,
our
position
is
that
it
protects
all
tenants
equally.
it
does
not
make
any
distinction
as
to
what
their
funds
may
be
that
they
have
available
to
them
whether
they
are
rich
or
poor.
it
just
applies
and
gives
equal
protection
to
all
tenants.
if
the
tenants,
first
of
all,
we
have
no
self-help
procedure
in
oregon
that
is
where
the
landlord
can
go
in
and
evict
the
tenant
himself.
if
he
wants
to
evict
a
tenant
from
the
property
he
has
to
go
in
to
the
court
and
get
a
determination
that
he
has
the
right
to
take
possession
from
the
tenant.
he
can
do
this,
if
the
tenant
has
failed
to
pay
the
rent
within
10
days
after
due
or
if
the
tenant’s
lease
has
expired
and
the
tenant
has
refused
to
get
out
or
if
the
tenant’s
month-to-month
or
what
tenancy
or
whatever
the
term
is
has
been
terminated
upon
either
30
days
notice
or
if
it
is
a
longer
tenancy
where
than
on
a
notice
equivalent
to
the
term
and
then
if
a
tenant
refuses
to
vacate,
the
landlord
must
in
order
to
have
a
determination
then
of
his
right
to
take
possession,
he
must
go
in
and
file
a
complaint
in
court,
setting
forth,
it
is
kind
of
a
notice
sort
of
a
complaint,
at
least
the
equivalent
of
the
federal
rules
requirements,
in
which
he
in
effect
says
that
the
tenant
is
withholding
the
premises
unlawfully
and
with
force
and
that
the
landlord
is
entitled
to
possession.
that
is
the
only
issue
in
the
fed
case
at
that
point
in
the
complaint.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
mr.
justice
that
is
correct
and
if
he
does
join,
he
can
join
an
action
for
rent
if
he
wishes
to
do
so
or
for
any
other
action
that
might
be
joinable
under
our
statute.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
but
if
he
does
then
the
fed
procedure
is
not
followed,
the
summary
procedure
is
not
followed
--
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
--
and
the
case
is
subject
to
the
ordinary
trial
of
procedure
and
instead
of
a
the
two
to
four
days
for
which
the
summons
would
state,
it
would
be
10
days
observed
in
the
county,
20
days
in
any
other
county
where
the
individual
did
not
actually
reside.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
yes,
sir
and
in
any
and
all
defenses,
including
counter
claims,
could
be
raise
then
in
the
action.
i
would
say
--
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
yes,
that
is
correct.
i
understand
--
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
yes.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
as
a
matter
of
practice,
in
most
fed
cases
the
simple
landlord-tenant
relationship
of
rental
of
a
residence
on
a
month-to-month
basis
file
just
for
possession
without
joining
any
rent
or
any
other
cause
of
action
with
it.
now,
i
think
the
court
should
realize
that
the
fed
eviction
laws
of
oregon
apply
not
only
to
the
rental
of
residences,
but
it
applies
and
is
available
and
used
in
connection
with
commercial
properties
where
there
is
a
lease
for
example
and
the
tenant
has
refused
to
vacate
at
the
end
of
the
lease
with
most
leasers
providing
that
if
they
hold
over
at
the
end
of
the
term,
then
they
are
month-to-month
tenants,
then
you
will
have
to
give
a
30-day
notice
and
bring
your
fed
action.
but
you
can
see
that
in
cases
involving
commercial
property
where
the
tenant
may
find
a
tremendous
financial
advantage
to
him
to
remain
in
a
particular
property
for
another
year
or
so,
it
would
be
a
unfair
to
permit
him
to
stay
in
just
by
continuing
to
pay
his
rent
if
the
landlord
has
given
him
the
30
days
notice
and
his
lease
term
is
over.
now,
we
have
personal
service
in
oregon
of
the
summons
in
complaint
on
the
tenant
and
the
summons
provides
that
the
matter
will
come
before
the
court
and
the
return
made
from
two
to
four
days,
the
day
of
service
is
not
counted.
so,
it
comes
up
then
before
the
court
at
that
time.
there
need
not
be
any
written
answer
filed.
we
have
procedure
in
the
oregon
law
which
grants
to
the
defendant
tenant
two
more
days
continuance
for
without
any
showing
of
any
kind.
he
can
have
an
additional
two
days
continuance
and
then
if
that
is
not
a
sufficient
amount
and
he
wishes
to
have
a
further
continuance
that
can
be
obtained
by
posting
security
for
the
payment
of
his
rent.
that
may
--
to
cover
the
period
of
the
time
for
the
continuance
that
he
wants,
in
other
words,
the
practical
aspect
of
that
is
that
he
does
not
have
to
go
back
and
pay
his
delinquent
rent,
that
is
not
an
issue
in
the
case.
it
is
possession
and
if
he
wants
to
remain
in
possession
and
get
a
continuance
of
the
case
for
more
time
for
preparation
or
for
whatever
the
reason
may
be,
he
can
do
so
from
a
practical
aspect
by
paying
the
month’s
rent
and
that
would
give
him
a
30-day
extension
of
time.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
there
is
no
provision,
mr.
chief
justice
for
the
payment
of
the
rent
into
court.
i
assume
that
the
trial
court
could
make
that
provision.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
i
believe
that
it
would
be.
it
has
not
been
the
practice
in
oregon
particularly.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
no,
it
did
not.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
and
the
thing
about
this
case
is
that
there
was
no
fed
eviction
commenced
by
mrs.
normet
against
the
lindseys.
the
claim
here
is
that
mrs.
normet
has
threatened
commencing
an
eviction
case
against
them
but
there
actually
was
no
case
filed.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
we
have
--
i
think
that
a
counsel
would
agree
with
me
that
we
have
a
different
interpretation
of
the
notice
that
was
sent
by
mrs.
normet’s
attorney
to
the
lindseys.
it
appears
it
was
a
letter.
it
appears
in
appendix.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
it
is
an
exhibit.
that
is
not
in
the
--
it
is
an
exhibit
in
the
case.
it
is
exhibit
number
14.
the
appellee’s
interpretation
of
the
letter
was
that
it
was
a
notice
or
demand
or
request
for
the
lindseys
to
comply
with
the
order
issued
by
the
city
of
portland
building
department
for
the
premises
to
be
vacated
because
it
was
substandard.
either
party
made
it,
mr.
justice.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
yes,
it
is.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
yes,
it
would
be
now,
i
would
say
--
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
yes,
he
could
under
a
special
appearance
to
quash
the
service
and
we
have
no
--
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
yes,
to
quash
whatever
the
service
was
and
it
would
--
he
can
reserve
that
by
making
a
special
--
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
well,
we
have
the
service
in
the
fed
case,
is
the
same
as
in
any
other
action
in
the
state
of
oregon
(voice
overlap).
we
have
personal
service
but
you
can
have
substituted
service
by
publishing,
there
could
be
a
publishing
which
if
the
person
is
concealed
within
the
state
or
is
outside
the
state
and
his
location
is
not
known,
but
in
support
of
that
there
would
have
to
be
an
affidavit,
prepared
and
filed
which
contained
facts,
sufficient
to
show
that
there
had
been
a
reasonable
search
made
for
the
party
before
the
publication
of
the
summons.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
well,
depending
on
had
he
left
some
of
his
belongings
in
the
property
perhaps
or
something
of
that
nature,
you
might
be
taking
a
chance
to
go
in
and
have
self-help
taking
possession
of
the
property,
but
the
service
is
no
different
in
the
fed
eviction
case
in
oregon
than
it
is
in
any
other
case.
so
we
do
not
have
what
is
called
conspicuous
service
or
so-called
sewer
service
as
i
notice
in
the
amicus
curiae
briefs,
they
have
in
new
york
and
florida.
we
do
not
have
that.
we
require
personal
service.
now,
either
party
can
request
and
have
a
jury
trial
and
if
the
tenant
and
that
is
to
determine
the
possession
and
the
tenant
can
interpose
defenses
which
are
relevant
to
the
question
of
possession.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
that
would
be
a
payment
of
rent
or
that
he
has
a
lease
on
the
property.
he
has
not
been
given
notice,
things
of
that
nature
which
are
relevant
to
the
possession.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
the
oregon
eviction
procedure
does
not
deprive
either
the
tenant
or
the
landlord
of
the
right
to
assert
other
claims
they
may
have
under
the
general
court
procedure
which
is
available
to
all.
in
other
words,
they
have
open
to
them
the
general
court
procedure
for
litigating
any
other
claims
that
they
may
have
against
each
other
arising
out
of
the
rent
agreement
or
the
rent
contract.
now,
the
appellants
seem
to
argue
here
that
all
defendants
should
be
treated
equally
and
that
it
is
wrong
to
have
a
separate
eviction
procedure
to
determine
possession
of
rented
property
between
the
landlord
and
tenant.
in
support
of
that,
they
compare
a
mortgage
foreclosure
case
with
an
fed
case
under
the
oregon
law
and
then
say
that
since
the
procedure
is
different
that
the
tenant
defendants
in
a
fed
case
do
not
receive
equal
protection
or
the
same
protection
as
an
owner
of
real
property
whose
mortgages
being
foreclosed
and
claim
that
therefore
the
eviction
or
fed
procedure
is
unconstitutional.
certainly
there
is
a
vast
difference
between
the
owner
of
real
property
who
is
delinquent
in
the
payment
of
a
mortgage
and
a
tenant
who
does
not
pay
his
rent.
it
seems
to
me,
that
we
certainly
would
not
require
a
landlord,
first
to
obtain
a
judgment
for
the
rent
and
then
hold
some
sort
of
a
judicial
sale
to
evict
the
tenant,
terminating
his
right
to
possession
of
the
property
perhaps
even
with
some
redemption
rights
following
the
order
have
some
sort
of
a
strict
foreclosure
proceeding
which
would
grant
the
tenant
some
period
of
time
to
pay
up
his
delinquency
before
the
landlord
could
retake
possession
of
his
property
from
a
defaulting
tenant.
i
submit
that
the
summary
eviction
procedures
justify
because
of
the
intending
rights
existing
in
a
landlord-tenant
relationship
and
the
oregon
eviction
law
grants
equal
protection
to
all
landlord
and
tenants.
the
state
of
oregon
has
the
right
to
establish
by
legislative
enactment
a
summary
procedure
to
determine
the
issue
of
possession
between
landlords
and
tenants
and
that
is
what
it
has
done
with
its
statute
and
laws.
now,
i
would
like
to
make
a
comment
or
two
with
regard
to
the
amicus
curiae
briefs
that
were
filed
in
this
case
primarily
to
make
the
point
that
the
oregon
eviction
laws
do
provide
due
process
to
tenants
in
compliance
with
the
united
states
constitution.
first
of
all,
we
have
no
self-help
provision
in
oregon
for
the
landlord
as
there
are
in
arkansas
and
arizona
under
their
unlawful
detainer
statutes
which
require
some
sort
of
a
bond
from
the
tenant
to
keep
possession
prior
to
trial.
before
the
landlord
in
oregon
can
take
any
steps
towards
recovering
possession
he
has
to
file
and
commence
a
case
in
court
under
the
eviction
statute,
filing
a
complaint.
we
do
not
have
what
is
called
conspicuous
service
or
so-called
sewer
service
in
oregon
as
they
apparently
have
in
new
york
and
florida.
oregon
requires
personal
service
or
the
same
service
as
in
any
other
litigation
in
the
oregon
courts.
we
do
not
permit
an
oral
complaint
as
in
kentucky.
oregon
requires
a
written
complaint
filed
in
a
summons
issue
and
we
permit
continuances.
we
do
not
refuse
to
grant
a
continuance
as
in
new
hampshire.
oregon
grants
a
two-day
continuance
without
any
cause
on
request
and
an
unlimited
continuance
if
security
posted
for
the
rent
which
may
be
found
due
during
the
continuance
period.
in
other
words,
you
can
pay
rent,
pay
your
current
rent
and
get
a
30-day
continuance.
in
kentucky,
it
permits,
in
amicus
curiae
brief,
there
is
a
statement
that
there
is
the
trial
as
before
the
court
not
presided
over
by
judges.
oregon
courts
are
all
presided
over
by
legally
trained
judges
and
jury
trial
on
request.
oregon
does
not
allow
in
the
fed
eviction,
the
landlord
to
recover
both
possessions
and
judgment
of
money
damages
as
in
the
california
and
new
hampshire
states.
in
oregon,
if
you
join
the
rent
claim
or
any
other
claim
that
you
have
then
you
have
to
make
the
usual
service
as
you
would
in
other
cases
and
it
proceeds
accordingly.
oregon
in
some
states
in
referring
primarily
to
california
observed
from
the
amicus
curiae
brief
that
they
allow
the
fed,
the
eviction
procedure
to
be
used
by
the
purchaser
at
an
execution
mortgage
foreclosure
to
recover
possession,
i
suppose
after
the
sale
of
the
property
at
sheriff
sale,
if
the
former
owner
does
not
voluntarily
surrender
possession
of
the
property.
and
they
also
allow
it
to
be
used
to
recover
possession
under
and
after
a
trustee's
sale
under
a
trustee’s
deed
to
evict
the
former
owner.
oregon
has
no
such
statute.
our
eviction
statute
is
related
and
confined
entirely
to
the
landlord-tenant
relationship.
oregon
does
not
deny
defenses
to
be
raised
in
eviction
proceedings
as
in
arizona.
we
permit
in
oregon
equitable
defenses,
relevant
to
the
right
of
possession
are
allowed.
oregon
does
not
require
a
bond
to
appeal
covering
the
past,
present,
and
future
rent
as
in
vermont
and
new
york.
the
bond
in
oregon
on
appeal,
the
tenant
wishes
to
remain
in
possession
is
for
twice
the
rental
value
only
for
the
period
--
only
for
the
period
from
commencement
of
action
to
final
judgment.
also,
and
--
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
the
purpose
of
that
is
stated
in
the
case
of
scales
versus
spencer
decided
by
the
oregon
supreme
court
in
1967,
in
which
it
said
that
in
as
much
as
a
final
judgment
for
restitution
could
not
include
a
judgment
for
rent,
pending
appeal,
it
appears
obvious
that
the
legislative
purpose
for
requiring
this
particular
bond
on
appeal
was
the
guarantee
that
the
rent
pending
on
appeal
would
be
paid.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
that
the
bond
must
provide
for
double
the
rental
value
was
no
doubt
intended
to
prevent
frivolous
appeals
for
the
purpose
of
delay.
if
there
were
not
some
added
cost
or
restriction,
every
ousted
tenant
would
appeal
regardless
of
the
justification.
it
can
also
be
assumed
that
the
additional
payment
would
compensate
for
ways
or
is
in
lieu
of
damages
or
the
unlawful
holding
over.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
no,
there
is
not
mr.
justice.
if
the
tenant
wants
to
appeal
and
remain
in
possession
then
the
oregon
eviction
law
provides
for
the
double
rent
bond.
if
he
surrenders
possession
and
wants
to
appeal
which
was
done
in
the
priester-thrall
case
which
is
cited
in
the
briefs,
then
he
does
not
have
to
put
up
the
double
rent
bond.
he
would
put
up
the
bond
provided
for
in
the
usual
undertaking
section
of
the
oregon
statute
which
would
be
for
--
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
cost
and
disbursements
and
any
damages
that
might
be
incurred
in
the
nature
of
waste
i
think.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
i
think
that
it
would
discourage
frivolous
appeals
and
i
suppose
as
the
appellants
here
claiming
that
--
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
well,
we
have
a
supersedeas
bond
which
is
in
damage
cases
if
you
want
to
stay
the
execution
of
any
judgment
or
you
have
to
put
up
a
supersedeas
bond.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
yes,
it
is
but
--
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
yes,
our
position
with
regard
to
that
is
that
to
permit
the
tenant
to
remain
in
possession
by
just
continuing
to
pay
just
the
rent
would
mean
that
he
could
stay
in
for
a
year
probably
or
longer
depending
on
how
long
it
took
the
case
to
progress
through
the
courts
and
that
would
point
out
that
he
could
do
that,
if
the
landlord,
now
this
applies,
the
eviction
procedure
applies
not
just
to
delinquent
rent
cases,
but
it
applies
where
the
landlord
might
want
to
take
the
property
will
say
off
the
market.
maybe
he
has
other
use
that
he
wishes
to
put
to
the
property
to.
maybe
he
wants
to
have
it
occupied
by
some
member
of
his
own
family.
in
other
words,
our
position
is
that
there
are
rights
in
the
landlord
in
his
properties
and
he
is
entitled
to
that
protection
and
if
you
do
not
preserve
or
protect
the
rights
of
a
landlord
then
you
would
be
depriving
him
of
his
property
rights
without
some
due
process.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
well,
i
do
not
that
you
could
actually
tell.
the
court
then
would
have
to
set
the
amount
of
bond
which
is
what
is
generally
done.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
well,
generally
that
is
not
the
case.
it
is
generally
fixed
and
that
goes
on
in
connection
with
the
appeal.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
i
am
not
certain
of
that
because
there
have
not
been
very
many
appeals.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
on
other
cases?
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
what
kind
of
a
bond?
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
it
can
be
--
no,
it
can
be
a
personal
--
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
--
or
a
surety
bond.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
well,
the
landlord
would
have
a
right
to
question
the
sureties
or
if
it
is
a
personal
surety
and
if
they
could
not
justify
by
showing
that
they
have
twice
the
property
equal
to
twice
the
value
of
the
bond
over
and
above
property
exempt
from
execution
or
then
the
court
would
not
approve
those
sureties.
but
it
is
up
to
the
court
and
in
many
cases
the
court
the
answering
party
questions,
would
question
the
sureties,
if
they
are
personal
sureties,
but
that
does
not
mean
that
he
would
have
a
right
to
discredit
them
if
they
qualified.
that
would
be
up
to
the
court.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
that
is
the
theory
of
the
eviction
statute
and
the
bond.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
that
is
correct.
he
would
not
collect
any
rent
and
he
would
be
being
deprived
of
the
possession
of
the
property
and
it
is
sort
of
liquidated
damage
amount,
is
the
way
that
it
is
treated
and
viewed.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
it
could
be
waived
by
the
parties.
i
do
not
believe
--
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
--
the
court
it
could
not
--
i
do
not
believe
the
court
would
have
the
right
to
waive
the
point
of
bond.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
if
the
tenant
surrenders
possession
or
then
he
can
go
ahead
--
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
(voice
overlap)
appeal.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
no,
he
would
only
get
the
amount
which
has
accrued
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
up
to
the
time
of
the
termination
of
the
case.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
that
is
my
understanding
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
theodore
b.
jensen
yes.
