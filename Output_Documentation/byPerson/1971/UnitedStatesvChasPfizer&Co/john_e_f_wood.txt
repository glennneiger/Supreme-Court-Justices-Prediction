mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
charles
pfizer
and
company,
one
of
the
three
respondents
in
this
case.
as
to
some
matters
in
the
case,
the
factual
situations
of
the
respondents
differ
from
one
another.
mine
will
be
to
present
matters
that
are
common
to
the
respondents
and
at
least
they
are
not
inconsistent
with
the
views
of
any
of
the
respondents.
at
the
outset,
i
should
like
to
refer
to
the
point
with
which
mr.
friedman
started
and
that
was
the
approach
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
this
case,
the
nature
of
its
review
and
the
nature
of
the
review
because
as
i
see
it
is
being
sought
in
this
court.
the
argument
has
been
made
in
the
government’s
briefs
that
in
this
case
in
effect
the
court
of
appeals
review
was
over
meticulous,
that
it
found
slight
errors
on
the
basis
of
considering
particular
language
in
isolation.
and
that
this
was
done
without
reference
to
the
charge
as
a
whole.
but
with
respect
i
urge
that
that
is
a
wholly
erroneous
evaluation
of
what
the
court
of
appeals
did.
the
court
of
appeals
tells
us
that
their
procedure
was
to
review
the
charge
as
a
whole
and
that
they
reviewed
the
entire
record,
the
whole
of
it.
they
considered
the
different
kinds
and
subjects
of
evidence
in
relation
to
each
other
and
they
considered
the
course
treatment
of
these
different
kinds
and
subjects
of
evidence
in
comparison
with
each
other.
and
the
court
was
concerned
that
whereas
the
instruction,
when
it
discussed
evidence
and
i’m
not
now
referring
to
the
general
parts
of
the
charge
where
the
basic
principles
are
applicable,
but
the
parts
in
which
evidence
was
discussed,
when
the
court
was
discussing
the
parts
of
the
evidence
upon
which
the
defendants
principally
relied,
it
did
not
give
the
jury
much
room
to
give
weight
to
that
evidence.
on
the
other
hand,
by
in
effect
neutralizing
the
evidence
upon
which
the
defendants
were
principally
relying,
the
field
was
left
for
the
inflammatory
materials
concerning
which
much
evidence
had
been
put,
which
as
the
court
of
appeals
noted
really
had
the
effect
of
converting
this
in
the
minds
of
a
lay
jury
to
a
trial
for
profiteering
and
patent
fraud.
the
importance
of
the
charge
in
this
case
was
fundamental
as
the
court
of
appeals
expressly
noted,
and
of
course,
in
reviewing
the
charge,
the
court
of
appeals
had
to
look
at
the
language
of
it
and
in
commenting
on
the
charge
it
had
to
comment
on
some
of
the
language.
but
that
is
a
far
cry
from
taking
words
in
isolation
and
i
submit
that
the
court
will
find
them
that
there
was
comprehensive
review
and
the
conclusion
to
which
the
court
came
was
that
because
of
errors
which
it
found
taken
as
a
whole,
not
picked
up
one
at
a
time
and
laid
aside,
but
taken
as
a
whole.
these
errors
were
sufficient
to
deprive
the
defendants
of
a
fair
trial.
now,
that
was
in
the
main,
i
submit
a
factual
exercise
and
a
factual
decision.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
cite
a
single
case
as
i
remember
in
its
opinion.
the
question
the
court
of
appeals
was
addressing
itself
to
was
having
in
mind
the
complexities
of
this
case,
the
different
kinds
of
evidence
that
are
involved,
the
significance
in
some
instance
is
very
limited,
significance
of
some
of
the
evidence
that
was
most
heavily
emphasized
by
the
government
has
this
trial
been
conducted
in
such
a
way
as
to
have
accorded
to
these
defendants
a
fair
trial
and
the
court
felt
itself
of
course
to
the
conclusion
that
the
answer
to
that
was
no.
mr.
friedman
was
asked
what
sort
of
review
was
expected
in
this
court.
i
would
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
that
the
only
review
that
could
be
done
would
be
to
go
through
the
same
process
that
the
court
of
appeals
went
through.
now
a
word,
if
the
court
please,
about
to
the
basic
issue
and
the
basic
problem
that
the
jury
had
to
deal
with
here,
it
has
been
clear
throughout
the
case
and
it's
conceded
by
government
counsel
stated
the
by
the
court
that
the
government's
sole
reliance
here
in
its
attempt
to
prove
any
implied
conspiracy
was
on
circumstantial
evidence.
there
were
agreements
among
the
parties,
written
agreements.
first,
negotiated
between
pfizer
and
cyanamid
in
november
1953,
a
later
group
negotiated
between
pfizer
on
the
one
hand
and
bristol,
squibb
and
upjohn
on
the
other
in
december
of
1955.
those
agreements
regulated
the
rights
and
obligations
of
the
parties
with
respect
to
some
of
the
subject
matter
of
this
case.
there
is
no
contention
that
any
of
those
agreements
was
in
itself
were
unlawful.
it
is
conceded
that
the
terms
under
which
the
parties
settled
their
affairs
where
lawful.
the
contention
is
rather
that
there
were
implied
understandings
in
addition
to
what
was
put
into
these
agreements
and
that
the
implied
understanding
was
to
be
found
on
the
basis
of
the
conduct
of
the
parties
after
their
settlements
and
the
logical
proposition
asserted
was
that
companies
acting
independently
and
without
conspiracy
would
not
in
fact
have
acted
the
way
these
companies
did.
now,
as
i’ve
said
the
court
found
that
some
of
the
evidence
most
heavily
relied
upon
was
--
by
the
defendants
was
not
given
correct
treatment
in
the
charge.
consider
for
example,
of
the
trial
court's
treatment
of
the
evidence
as
to
parke-davis
and
company
to
which
mr.
friedman
has
made
some
reference.
bear
in
mind,
if
the
court
please,
that
the
proposition
being
put
to
the
jury
here
was
that
a
company
acting
independently
and
without
conspiracy
would
not
have
done
the
things
that
these
defendants
did
with
respect
to
the
pricing
of
their
products,
with
respect
to
sales
in
bulk,
with
respect
to
the
granting
of
patent
licenses.
that
meant
of
course
that
the
jurors
had
asked
themselves,
well,
what
would
an
independent
company
not
in
conspiracy
had
done
and
it
happened
that
we
had
in
this
case
an
independent,
non-conspiratorial
model,
the
second
largest
company
in
the
industry,
one
of
the
most
successful
companies
in
the
industry
which
was
assertedly
not
a
conspirator
and
the
evidence
showed
without
any
question
that
as
to
pricing,
that
company
parke-davis
and
company
from
the
beginning
of
its
participation
in
this
industry
right
down
to
1960,
acted
exactly
the
same
way
these
defendants
did
with
respect
to
the
levels
of
prices
and
all
the
other
aspects
of
pricing.
and
far
as
bulk
sales
and
patent
licensing
were
concerned,
the
evidence
showed
that
parke-davis’
behavior
was,
if
anything,
even
more
niggardly
than
that
of
the
defendants.
it
granted
no
licenses
to
anybody.
it
sold
no
bulk
to
anybody
and
the
court
and
jury
did
not
have
to
speculate
as
to
why
this
was
so.
the
president
of
parke-davis
was
called
by
the
government
and
he
testified
about
these
policies
of
his
company
and
stated
the
reasons
for
them,
so
it
was
all
laid
out.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
yes,
your
honor,
i
would
come
to
that
mr.
chief
justice,
but
the
key
point
is
that
an
important
fact
about
the
evidence
was
not
put
to
the
jury
and
i
am
coming
to
that
right
now
and
i
will.
the
key
to
the
significance
was
that
in
this
case,
the
government
counsel
affirmatively
asserted
that
parke-davis
absolutely
was
not
a
conspirator.
it
was
not
merely
said
that
parke-davis
was
not
indicted
or
has
not
been
charged
as
a
co-conspirator.
government
counsel
said
and
the
trial
court
noted
in
colloquy
which
is
quoted
in
our
brief
that
parke-davis
absolutely
was
not
a
conspirator
and
i
state
that
on
record
said
government
counsel.
well,
that
meant
that
this
company,
the
parallel
acts
of
this
company
was
the
action
of
a
company
assertedly
not
a
member
of
any
conspiracy.
we
sought
to
have
that
fact
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
jury.
we
asked
the
court
in
its
charge
to
the
jury
to
inform
them
of
the
fact
that
parke-davis
was
not
--
was
asserted
not
to
be
a
conspirator.
the
court
declined
to
do
that.
we
even
tried
some
other
ways
because
well,
may
we
argue
then
some
of
presumption
of
innocence
and
the
court
said,
“no,
you
may
not.
i
will
stop
you
if
you
try
that.”
well,
may
we
argue
about
the
presumption
of
regularity
of
business
conduct?
“no,
i
will
stop
you
if
you
try
that”
and
the
most
that
the
court
would
do
in
informing
the
jury
about
this
was
to
say
that
parke-davis
had
not
been
indicted
and
was
not
charged
as
a
co-conspirator.
and
the
charge
went
further
and
made
greater
difficulty
for
us
because
after
having
limited
the
information
to
the
jury
to
just
--
the
technical
fact
that
there
was
no
indictment
against
parke-davis
and
no
charge
of
being
a
co-conspirator,
the
judge
went
further
and
told
the
jurors
that
in
emphatic
times,
that
the
fact
that
parke-davis
was
not
indicted
and
these
were
quoted
from
charge,
has
no
relevance
whatsoever
in
any
direction
as
a
fact
itself.
now,
what
could
the
jury
make
of
that?
all
we
know
about
parke-davis
is,
that
it’s
not
indicted
and
the
judge
tells
us
that
the
fact
that
it’s
not
indicted
has
no
significance
in
any
direction.
how
can
we
relate
this
evidence?
and
then
the
court
took
one
final
step,
or
before
i
--
may
i
just
refer
to
a
fancy
at
page
70
of
the
brief
of
the
government
in
this
case,
the
main
brief,
it
is
said
there
inadvertently
that
there
was
constant
reminders
that
parke-davis
was
not
considered
a
conspirator.
that
the
court
will
find
is
not
what
the
record
shows.
what
we
were
trying
to
do
was
to
get
the
court
to
inform
the
jury
that
parke-davis
was
not
a
conspirator
and
that
we
did
not
succeed
in.
well,
the
final
words
of
the
judge
about
this
parke-davis
testimony,
said
that
since
parke-davis
is
not
on
trial
here
and
since
the
defendants
are
on
trial,
your
verdict,
and
i
quote,
“must
be
based
in
the
end
on
the
law
and
the
evidence
relating
to
them,
to
the
defendants.”
that
left
the
jury
very
little
room
to
give
weight
to
the
action
of
parke-davis.
they
were
told
that
what
they
must
look
at
is
not
parke-davis’
actions,
but
the
defendants.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
well,
not
--
no
sir,
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
that
the
limitations
--
well,
there
were
--
i
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
--
we
were
told
that
we
could
not
make
certain
arguments.
we
were
told
by
the
court
also
that
we
could
risk
argument
if
we
wished,
but
we
were
given
the
definite
impression
that
the
court
was
going
to
be
very
strict
in
limiting
us
and
we
simply
did
not
know
what
to
do.
we
did
try
to
argue
it
to
a
limited
extent,
but
since
the
key
fact
had
not
been
put
to
the
jury
and
we
were
not
free
to
put
it
to
the
jury,
our
argument
was
necessarily
much
less
effective
than
it
could
have
been.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
yes,
mr.
justice,
they
are.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
we
can
supply
those
--
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
well,
i
have
really
just
as
briefly
as
i
can
adequately
on
the
parke-davis
aspect
that
i
should
like
to
turn
to
another
part
of
the
charge
as
to
which
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
evidence
favorable
to
the
defense
was
seriously
undermined
by
the
charge
and
that
had
to
do
with
testimony
by
the
principal
officers
of
the
defendants.
these
men
were
called
by
the
government
as
the
persons
who
made
the
decisions
that
were
alleged
to
be
conspiratorial
and
they
were
examined
at
length
by
government
counsel,
and
they
were
cross-examined.
they
gave
detailed
factual
accounts
of
the
actions,
of
their
actions
in
determining
the
policies
of
their
respective
companies
as
to
all
of
the
matters
involved
in
the
case.
they
described
the
business
and
economic
considerations,
many
of
them
quite
peculiar
to
the
prescription
drug
business
and
many
of
them
of
special
application
to
segment
of
that
business
that
included
these
new
wonderfully
popular
wonder
drugs.
and
they
showed
how
those
economic
and
business
factors
really
govern
their
decisions
and
would
have
not
indicated
that
other
decisions
could’ve
been
made
without
loss
of
profitability.
in
the
course
of
this
testimony,
they
told
in
detail
about
the
meetings
at
which
conspiracy
was
alleged
to
had
its
inception.
the
meetings
in
november
of
1953,
between
pfizer
and
cyanamid,
the
meetings
in
december
of
1955
at
which
bristol,
squibb
and
upjohn
would
claim
to
have
adhered
to
the
conspiracy.
they
described
what
these
meetings
were
about,
how
they
came
to
be
held,
what
problems
they
discussed,
the
objectives
of
each
party,
what
was
said,
and
what
was
done
by
the
participants,
very
full
detailed
factual
accounts
of
what
transpired.
now,
in
the
course
of
this,
they
made
certain
denials
asserting
that
the
agreements,
alleged
to
have
risen
by
implication
were
not
formed
and
that
the
parties
remained
free
as
to
all
these
matters.
now,
this
testimony
was
completely
inconsistent
with
any
implied
conspiracy
and
taken
as
a
whole,
the
testimony
was
a
cornerstone
of
the
defense
case.
but
although
the
court
and
charge
to
the
jury
began
by
saying
that
the
jury
should
give
full
consideration
to
this,
the
rest
of
the
discussions
of
this
evidence,
again
i
am
not
talking
about
the
general
parts
of
the
charge
but
the
parts
where
the
court
was
specifically
addressing
itself
to
this
evidence,
really
consistent
as
the
court
will
see
of
a
series
of
reasons
why
the
jury
should
give
that
evidence
little
if
any
weight.
our
time
doesn’t
permit
me
to
touch
on
--
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
oh,
yes,
yes.
but
our
contention
and
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
that
the
court
here
commented
erroneously.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
spent
several
hours
with
the
judge
making
the
exceptions,
making
additional
request,s
urging
the
judge
to
correct
some
of
the
serious
errors
that
we
felt
were
involved
and
the
judge
did
not
change
one
word
of
the
charge.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
i
believe
it
is
mr.
justice.
the
--
this
colloquy
--
5007,
i
should
note
there
that
we
had
a
stipulation
that
all
the
requests,
charges,
and
all
exceptions
and
so
on
made
by
anyone
understand
would
be
nearest
to
the
law,
so
the
fact
that
one
lawyer
speaking
here
and
another
lawyer
there
has
no
particular
significance.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
yes,
mr.
justice.
they
asked
for
the
parke-davis
matter.
it’s
an
interesting
point
there
which
has
some
significance
as
to
the
effect
of
the
charge
and
the
importance
of
looking
the
words.
the
jury
did
not
have
to
rely
upon
an
impressionistic
recollection
of
something
they
have
heard
hours
before.
it
was
followed
here
the
unusual
of
course
that
the
court
provided
to
each
juror
a
full
copy
of
the
charge
to
take
into
the
jury
room
with
him.
so
they
could
take
it
up
line
by
line
and
that
they
did
so
as
indicated
by
the
fact
that
when
they
asked
for
evidence
to
be
given
to
them,
they
asked
for
it
by
reference
to
a
specific
passage.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
i
believe
that
is
all.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
well,
may
i
just
mention
a
couple
of
points
about
the
difficulties
with
the
charges
and
testimonies
of
our
position.
i’m
really
limited
to
one,
in
view
of
shortness
of
time.
after
having
suggested
several
reasons
why
the
testimony
should
be
given
--
perhaps
a
limited
way
that
it
need
not
be
given
much
weight,
i
believe
that
is
a
fair
characterization
of
the
effect
of
the
charge.
the
court
concluded
on
this
subject
by
saying
that
in
considering
whether
to
give
regard
to
the
evidence,
they
should
bear
in
mind
the
fact
that
these
assertions
of
innocence
by
the
officers
may
have
included
the
intentions
of
law
and
of
course
he
has
made
it
clear
to
the
jury
that
they
would’ve
take
the
law
from
the
judge
and
not
from
any
other
source.
nothing
was
said
as
to
what
part
of
this
was
contentions
of
law.
it
was
simply
said,
you
--
in
considering
this
you
must
bear
in
mind
that
does
this
may
include
contentions
of
law.
now,
this
testimony
was
intensely
factual
and
even
in
the
denials
it
was
factual.
the
question
here
was
whether
an
implied
understandings
had
been
reached
by
these
men.
there
was
no
question
of
law
as
to
what
you
can
do
under
a
patent
or
what
you
can
do
in
certain
circumstances.
everybody
knew
that
if
this
business
was
conducted
independently,
what
the
parties
did
was
lawful.
it
was
conducted
under
some
implied
understandings
it
was
not
lawful
so
the
fact
of
understandings
was
the
essential
issue
in
the
case.
and
the
factual
nature
of
such
testimony
was
established
by
this
court
in
the
interstate
circuit
case.
there
the
court
held
in
a
sherman
act
case
that
the
inferences
adverse
to
the
defendants
could
be
drawn
from
the
fact
as
to
whether
there
had
been
an
agreement
for
concerted
action
because
the
defendants
did
not
produce
witnesses
under
their
control
who
were
in
a
position
to
testify
as
to
whether
there
had
been
agreements
or
concerted
actions.
now,
the
necessary
and
explicit
premise
of
that
decision
was
this
would
be
factual
testimony
and
it
would
be
anomalous,
i
submit,
to
hold
in
the
face
of
that
decision
that
if
such
witnesses
are
called
and
do
testify,
the
jury
maybe
allowed
to
rest
their
testimonies
aside
on
the
grounds
that
some
undisclosed
part
of
it
is
regarded
as
to
making
factual
contentions,
i
mean,
legal
contentions.
may
i
take
just
a
few
minutes
on
subject
of
costs,
profits,
unreasonable
profits,
unreasonable
prices.
one
of
the
most
amazing
aspects
of
this
case
was
the
extent
of
which
the
prosecution
was
based
on
the
constant
hammering
of
the
proposition
that
these
companies
made
too
much
money
and
that
that
necessarily
meant
with
their
prices
were
too
high.
whatever
reasons
were
advanced
for
the
admissibility
of
the
evidence
about
the
costs
and
profits,
those
reasons
were
not
what
was
put
to
the
jury
by
government
counsel,
were
unreasonably
high.
now
the
technique
chosen
for
showing
that
the
profits
were
so
high
was
to
take
their
manufacturing
cost
and
compare
that
with
the
selling
price
and
say
that
the
difference
is
profit.
the
manufacturing
cost
included
nothing
for
research
or
warehousing
and
distribution,
for
selling
and
promotion,
for
administrative
overhead,
for
taxes.
so,
everybody
knew
that
this
comparison
did
not
involve
a
comparison
which
could
show
true
profit.
the
government
had
available,
had
in
its
possession,
accounting
studies
which
were
designed
to
show
total
costs
and
true
profit.
it
declined
to
use
these
studies
but
hammered
away
at
this
production
cost,
selling
price
comparison,
and
in
the
opening
to
the
jury,
in
the
summation
with
play
cards,
with
magnified
tables
and
charts,
that
was
the
subject
that
was
dinned
into
the
jury
of
both
into
their
eyes
and
to
their
ears.
we
tried
as
best
we
could
to
stir
trial
away
from
the
question
of
the
fairness
of
profits
because
that
question
has
no
bearing
in
this
case.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
well,
mr.
justice
we
did
not.
our
plan
as
the
government
counsel
is
indicated
in
his
brief,
since
the
--
both
government
testimony
upon
which
the
defendants
were
going
to
rely
was
being
put
in
--
had
been
put
in
by
the
government.
we
wish
to
put
in
our
whole
case
of
this
part
of
the
government
case,
so
we
would
not
in
the
eyes
of
the
jury
be
protecting
the
trial
with
the
unnecessary
carrying
on
of
what
had
been
deducted.
we
did
in
the
course
of
cross
examination
seek
to
have
received
these
accounting
studies.
they
were
rejected
not
finally
but
at
that
time.
the
one
--
the
one
offered
by
pfizer
for
example,
was
rejected
on
the
grounds
that
the
government
needed
more
time
to
study
it.
the
government
had
had
it
for
over
seven
years
and
the
argument
that
it
should
not
be
received
at
that
stage
of
the
trial
because
the
government
needed
more
time
to
study
it
frankly
did
not
make
any
sense.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
no,
mr.
justice
we
did
not.
we
did
not
put
in
the
case
except
to
call
one
witness
to
put
in
one
exhibit.
well,
the
--
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
oh!
half-an-hour.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
about
14
hours,
a
great
deal
of
which
was
at
night.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
yes
sir.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
yes,
sir.
and
that
these
errors
not
taken
separately,
as
government
counsel
asserts,
but
looking
at
the
conduct
of
the
trial
as
a
whole,
the
charges
as
a
whole,
that
the
effect
of
it
was
to
produce
an
imbalance
from
the
evidence
favorable
to
the
defendants
was
downgraded
and
undercut
when
this
inflammatory
evidence
principally
relied
on
by
the
government
was
given
much
freer
scope,
the
effect
was
an
imbalance
which
in
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
resulted
in
the
denial
of
a
fair
trial.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
well,
if
this
mr.
justice
blackmun,
he
conceded
at
the
outset
that
the
government’s
evidence
was
not
particularly
strong,
at
least
not
overwhelming
as
the
way
you
characterized
it.
as
to
some
of
the
errors,
i
submit
he
did
not
disagree
that
they
were
errors
as
to
parke-davis
for
example,
but
he
said
that
it
appeared
to
him
that
it
wasn’t
necessary
to
reverse
on
the
ground
of
these
errors.
well,
i
submit
that
the
errors
were
fundamental
and
that
taken
together
they
did
result
in
an
imbalance
which
was
quite
hurtful
to
the
defense.
thank
you.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
charles
pfizer
and
company,
one
of
the
three
respondents
in
this
case.
as
to
some
matters
in
the
case,
the
factual
situations
of
the
respondents
differ
from
one
another.
mine
will
be
to
present
matters
that
are
common
to
the
respondents
and
at
least
they
are
not
inconsistent
with
the
views
of
any
of
the
respondents.
at
the
outset,
i
should
like
to
refer
to
the
point
with
which
mr.
friedman
started
and
that
was
the
approach
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
this
case,
the
nature
of
its
review
and
the
nature
of
the
review
because
as
i
see
it
is
being
sought
in
this
court.
the
argument
has
been
made
in
the
government’s
briefs
that
in
this
case
in
effect
the
court
of
appeals
review
was
over
meticulous,
that
it
found
slight
errors
on
the
basis
of
considering
particular
language
in
isolation.
and
that
this
was
done
without
reference
to
the
charge
as
a
whole.
but
with
respect
i
urge
that
that
is
a
wholly
erroneous
evaluation
of
what
the
court
of
appeals
did.
the
court
of
appeals
tells
us
that
their
procedure
was
to
review
the
charge
as
a
whole
and
that
they
reviewed
the
entire
record,
the
whole
of
it.
they
considered
the
different
kinds
and
subjects
of
evidence
in
relation
to
each
other
and
they
considered
the
course
treatment
of
these
different
kinds
and
subjects
of
evidence
in
comparison
with
each
other.
and
the
court
was
concerned
that
whereas
the
instruction,
when
it
discussed
evidence
and
i’m
not
now
referring
to
the
general
parts
of
the
charge
where
the
basic
principles
are
applicable,
but
the
parts
in
which
evidence
was
discussed,
when
the
court
was
discussing
the
parts
of
the
evidence
upon
which
the
defendants
principally
relied,
it
did
not
give
the
jury
much
room
to
give
weight
to
that
evidence.
on
the
other
hand,
by
in
effect
neutralizing
the
evidence
upon
which
the
defendants
were
principally
relying,
the
field
was
left
for
the
inflammatory
materials
concerning
which
much
evidence
had
been
put,
which
as
the
court
of
appeals
noted
really
had
the
effect
of
converting
this
in
the
minds
of
a
lay
jury
to
a
trial
for
profiteering
and
patent
fraud.
the
importance
of
the
charge
in
this
case
was
fundamental
as
the
court
of
appeals
expressly
noted,
and
of
course,
in
reviewing
the
charge,
the
court
of
appeals
had
to
look
at
the
language
of
it
and
in
commenting
on
the
charge
it
had
to
comment
on
some
of
the
language.
but
that
is
a
far
cry
from
taking
words
in
isolation
and
i
submit
that
the
court
will
find
them
that
there
was
comprehensive
review
and
the
conclusion
to
which
the
court
came
was
that
because
of
errors
which
it
found
taken
as
a
whole,
not
picked
up
one
at
a
time
and
laid
aside,
but
taken
as
a
whole.
these
errors
were
sufficient
to
deprive
the
defendants
of
a
fair
trial.
now,
that
was
in
the
main,
i
submit
a
factual
exercise
and
a
factual
decision.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
cite
a
single
case
as
i
remember
in
its
opinion.
the
question
the
court
of
appeals
was
addressing
itself
to
was
having
in
mind
the
complexities
of
this
case,
the
different
kinds
of
evidence
that
are
involved,
the
significance
in
some
instance
is
very
limited,
significance
of
some
of
the
evidence
that
was
most
heavily
emphasized
by
the
government
has
this
trial
been
conducted
in
such
a
way
as
to
have
accorded
to
these
defendants
a
fair
trial
and
the
court
felt
itself
of
course
to
the
conclusion
that
the
answer
to
that
was
no.
mr.
friedman
was
asked
what
sort
of
review
was
expected
in
this
court.
i
would
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
that
the
only
review
that
could
be
done
would
be
to
go
through
the
same
process
that
the
court
of
appeals
went
through.
now
a
word,
if
the
court
please,
about
to
the
basic
issue
and
the
basic
problem
that
the
jury
had
to
deal
with
here,
it
has
been
clear
throughout
the
case
and
it's
conceded
by
government
counsel
stated
the
by
the
court
that
the
government's
sole
reliance
here
in
its
attempt
to
prove
any
implied
conspiracy
was
on
circumstantial
evidence.
there
were
agreements
among
the
parties,
written
agreements.
first,
negotiated
between
pfizer
and
cyanamid
in
november
1953,
a
later
group
negotiated
between
pfizer
on
the
one
hand
and
bristol,
squibb
and
upjohn
on
the
other
in
december
of
1955.
those
agreements
regulated
the
rights
and
obligations
of
the
parties
with
respect
to
some
of
the
subject
matter
of
this
case.
there
is
no
contention
that
any
of
those
agreements
was
in
itself
were
unlawful.
it
is
conceded
that
the
terms
under
which
the
parties
settled
their
affairs
where
lawful.
the
contention
is
rather
that
there
were
implied
understandings
in
addition
to
what
was
put
into
these
agreements
and
that
the
implied
understanding
was
to
be
found
on
the
basis
of
the
conduct
of
the
parties
after
their
settlements
and
the
logical
proposition
asserted
was
that
companies
acting
independently
and
without
conspiracy
would
not
in
fact
have
acted
the
way
these
companies
did.
now,
as
i’ve
said
the
court
found
that
some
of
the
evidence
most
heavily
relied
upon
was
--
by
the
defendants
was
not
given
correct
treatment
in
the
charge.
consider
for
example,
of
the
trial
court's
treatment
of
the
evidence
as
to
parke-davis
and
company
to
which
mr.
friedman
has
made
some
reference.
bear
in
mind,
if
the
court
please,
that
the
proposition
being
put
to
the
jury
here
was
that
a
company
acting
independently
and
without
conspiracy
would
not
have
done
the
things
that
these
defendants
did
with
respect
to
the
pricing
of
their
products,
with
respect
to
sales
in
bulk,
with
respect
to
the
granting
of
patent
licenses.
that
meant
of
course
that
the
jurors
had
asked
themselves,
well,
what
would
an
independent
company
not
in
conspiracy
had
done
and
it
happened
that
we
had
in
this
case
an
independent,
non-conspiratorial
model,
the
second
largest
company
in
the
industry,
one
of
the
most
successful
companies
in
the
industry
which
was
assertedly
not
a
conspirator
and
the
evidence
showed
without
any
question
that
as
to
pricing,
that
company
parke-davis
and
company
from
the
beginning
of
its
participation
in
this
industry
right
down
to
1960,
acted
exactly
the
same
way
these
defendants
did
with
respect
to
the
levels
of
prices
and
all
the
other
aspects
of
pricing.
and
far
as
bulk
sales
and
patent
licensing
were
concerned,
the
evidence
showed
that
parke-davis’
behavior
was,
if
anything,
even
more
niggardly
than
that
of
the
defendants.
it
granted
no
licenses
to
anybody.
it
sold
no
bulk
to
anybody
and
the
court
and
jury
did
not
have
to
speculate
as
to
why
this
was
so.
the
president
of
parke-davis
was
called
by
the
government
and
he
testified
about
these
policies
of
his
company
and
stated
the
reasons
for
them,
so
it
was
all
laid
out.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
yes,
your
honor,
i
would
come
to
that
mr.
chief
justice,
but
the
key
point
is
that
an
important
fact
about
the
evidence
was
not
put
to
the
jury
and
i
am
coming
to
that
right
now
and
i
will.
the
key
to
the
significance
was
that
in
this
case,
the
government
counsel
affirmatively
asserted
that
parke-davis
absolutely
was
not
a
conspirator.
it
was
not
merely
said
that
parke-davis
was
not
indicted
or
has
not
been
charged
as
a
co-conspirator.
government
counsel
said
and
the
trial
court
noted
in
colloquy
which
is
quoted
in
our
brief
that
parke-davis
absolutely
was
not
a
conspirator
and
i
state
that
on
record
said
government
counsel.
well,
that
meant
that
this
company,
the
parallel
acts
of
this
company
was
the
action
of
a
company
assertedly
not
a
member
of
any
conspiracy.
we
sought
to
have
that
fact
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
jury.
we
asked
the
court
in
its
charge
to
the
jury
to
inform
them
of
the
fact
that
parke-davis
was
not
--
was
asserted
not
to
be
a
conspirator.
the
court
declined
to
do
that.
we
even
tried
some
other
ways
because
well,
may
we
argue
then
some
of
presumption
of
innocence
and
the
court
said,
“no,
you
may
not.
i
will
stop
you
if
you
try
that.”
well,
may
we
argue
about
the
presumption
of
regularity
of
business
conduct?
“no,
i
will
stop
you
if
you
try
that”
and
the
most
that
the
court
would
do
in
informing
the
jury
about
this
was
to
say
that
parke-davis
had
not
been
indicted
and
was
not
charged
as
a
co-conspirator.
and
the
charge
went
further
and
made
greater
difficulty
for
us
because
after
having
limited
the
information
to
the
jury
to
just
--
the
technical
fact
that
there
was
no
indictment
against
parke-davis
and
no
charge
of
being
a
co-conspirator,
the
judge
went
further
and
told
the
jurors
that
in
emphatic
times,
that
the
fact
that
parke-davis
was
not
indicted
and
these
were
quoted
from
charge,
has
no
relevance
whatsoever
in
any
direction
as
a
fact
itself.
now,
what
could
the
jury
make
of
that?
all
we
know
about
parke-davis
is,
that
it’s
not
indicted
and
the
judge
tells
us
that
the
fact
that
it’s
not
indicted
has
no
significance
in
any
direction.
how
can
we
relate
this
evidence?
and
then
the
court
took
one
final
step,
or
before
i
--
may
i
just
refer
to
a
fancy
at
page
70
of
the
brief
of
the
government
in
this
case,
the
main
brief,
it
is
said
there
inadvertently
that
there
was
constant
reminders
that
parke-davis
was
not
considered
a
conspirator.
that
the
court
will
find
is
not
what
the
record
shows.
what
we
were
trying
to
do
was
to
get
the
court
to
inform
the
jury
that
parke-davis
was
not
a
conspirator
and
that
we
did
not
succeed
in.
well,
the
final
words
of
the
judge
about
this
parke-davis
testimony,
said
that
since
parke-davis
is
not
on
trial
here
and
since
the
defendants
are
on
trial,
your
verdict,
and
i
quote,
“must
be
based
in
the
end
on
the
law
and
the
evidence
relating
to
them,
to
the
defendants.”
that
left
the
jury
very
little
room
to
give
weight
to
the
action
of
parke-davis.
they
were
told
that
what
they
must
look
at
is
not
parke-davis’
actions,
but
the
defendants.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
well,
not
--
no
sir,
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
that
the
limitations
--
well,
there
were
--
i
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
--
we
were
told
that
we
could
not
make
certain
arguments.
we
were
told
by
the
court
also
that
we
could
risk
argument
if
we
wished,
but
we
were
given
the
definite
impression
that
the
court
was
going
to
be
very
strict
in
limiting
us
and
we
simply
did
not
know
what
to
do.
we
did
try
to
argue
it
to
a
limited
extent,
but
since
the
key
fact
had
not
been
put
to
the
jury
and
we
were
not
free
to
put
it
to
the
jury,
our
argument
was
necessarily
much
less
effective
than
it
could
have
been.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
yes,
mr.
justice,
they
are.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
we
can
supply
those
--
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
well,
i
have
really
just
as
briefly
as
i
can
adequately
on
the
parke-davis
aspect
that
i
should
like
to
turn
to
another
part
of
the
charge
as
to
which
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
evidence
favorable
to
the
defense
was
seriously
undermined
by
the
charge
and
that
had
to
do
with
testimony
by
the
principal
officers
of
the
defendants.
these
men
were
called
by
the
government
as
the
persons
who
made
the
decisions
that
were
alleged
to
be
conspiratorial
and
they
were
examined
at
length
by
government
counsel,
and
they
were
cross-examined.
they
gave
detailed
factual
accounts
of
the
actions,
of
their
actions
in
determining
the
policies
of
their
respective
companies
as
to
all
of
the
matters
involved
in
the
case.
they
described
the
business
and
economic
considerations,
many
of
them
quite
peculiar
to
the
prescription
drug
business
and
many
of
them
of
special
application
to
segment
of
that
business
that
included
these
new
wonderfully
popular
wonder
drugs.
and
they
showed
how
those
economic
and
business
factors
really
govern
their
decisions
and
would
have
not
indicated
that
other
decisions
could’ve
been
made
without
loss
of
profitability.
in
the
course
of
this
testimony,
they
told
in
detail
about
the
meetings
at
which
conspiracy
was
alleged
to
had
its
inception.
the
meetings
in
november
of
1953,
between
pfizer
and
cyanamid,
the
meetings
in
december
of
1955
at
which
bristol,
squibb
and
upjohn
would
claim
to
have
adhered
to
the
conspiracy.
they
described
what
these
meetings
were
about,
how
they
came
to
be
held,
what
problems
they
discussed,
the
objectives
of
each
party,
what
was
said,
and
what
was
done
by
the
participants,
very
full
detailed
factual
accounts
of
what
transpired.
now,
in
the
course
of
this,
they
made
certain
denials
asserting
that
the
agreements,
alleged
to
have
risen
by
implication
were
not
formed
and
that
the
parties
remained
free
as
to
all
these
matters.
now,
this
testimony
was
completely
inconsistent
with
any
implied
conspiracy
and
taken
as
a
whole,
the
testimony
was
a
cornerstone
of
the
defense
case.
but
although
the
court
and
charge
to
the
jury
began
by
saying
that
the
jury
should
give
full
consideration
to
this,
the
rest
of
the
discussions
of
this
evidence,
again
i
am
not
talking
about
the
general
parts
of
the
charge
but
the
parts
where
the
court
was
specifically
addressing
itself
to
this
evidence,
really
consistent
as
the
court
will
see
of
a
series
of
reasons
why
the
jury
should
give
that
evidence
little
if
any
weight.
our
time
doesn’t
permit
me
to
touch
on
--
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
oh,
yes,
yes.
but
our
contention
and
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
that
the
court
here
commented
erroneously.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
spent
several
hours
with
the
judge
making
the
exceptions,
making
additional
request,s
urging
the
judge
to
correct
some
of
the
serious
errors
that
we
felt
were
involved
and
the
judge
did
not
change
one
word
of
the
charge.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
i
believe
it
is
mr.
justice.
the
--
this
colloquy
--
5007,
i
should
note
there
that
we
had
a
stipulation
that
all
the
requests,
charges,
and
all
exceptions
and
so
on
made
by
anyone
understand
would
be
nearest
to
the
law,
so
the
fact
that
one
lawyer
speaking
here
and
another
lawyer
there
has
no
particular
significance.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
yes,
mr.
justice.
they
asked
for
the
parke-davis
matter.
it’s
an
interesting
point
there
which
has
some
significance
as
to
the
effect
of
the
charge
and
the
importance
of
looking
the
words.
the
jury
did
not
have
to
rely
upon
an
impressionistic
recollection
of
something
they
have
heard
hours
before.
it
was
followed
here
the
unusual
of
course
that
the
court
provided
to
each
juror
a
full
copy
of
the
charge
to
take
into
the
jury
room
with
him.
so
they
could
take
it
up
line
by
line
and
that
they
did
so
as
indicated
by
the
fact
that
when
they
asked
for
evidence
to
be
given
to
them,
they
asked
for
it
by
reference
to
a
specific
passage.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
i
believe
that
is
all.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
well,
may
i
just
mention
a
couple
of
points
about
the
difficulties
with
the
charges
and
testimonies
of
our
position.
i’m
really
limited
to
one,
in
view
of
shortness
of
time.
after
having
suggested
several
reasons
why
the
testimony
should
be
given
--
perhaps
a
limited
way
that
it
need
not
be
given
much
weight,
i
believe
that
is
a
fair
characterization
of
the
effect
of
the
charge.
the
court
concluded
on
this
subject
by
saying
that
in
considering
whether
to
give
regard
to
the
evidence,
they
should
bear
in
mind
the
fact
that
these
assertions
of
innocence
by
the
officers
may
have
included
the
intentions
of
law
and
of
course
he
has
made
it
clear
to
the
jury
that
they
would’ve
take
the
law
from
the
judge
and
not
from
any
other
source.
nothing
was
said
as
to
what
part
of
this
was
contentions
of
law.
it
was
simply
said,
you
--
in
considering
this
you
must
bear
in
mind
that
does
this
may
include
contentions
of
law.
now,
this
testimony
was
intensely
factual
and
even
in
the
denials
it
was
factual.
the
question
here
was
whether
an
implied
understandings
had
been
reached
by
these
men.
there
was
no
question
of
law
as
to
what
you
can
do
under
a
patent
or
what
you
can
do
in
certain
circumstances.
everybody
knew
that
if
this
business
was
conducted
independently,
what
the
parties
did
was
lawful.
it
was
conducted
under
some
implied
understandings
it
was
not
lawful
so
the
fact
of
understandings
was
the
essential
issue
in
the
case.
and
the
factual
nature
of
such
testimony
was
established
by
this
court
in
the
interstate
circuit
case.
there
the
court
held
in
a
sherman
act
case
that
the
inferences
adverse
to
the
defendants
could
be
drawn
from
the
fact
as
to
whether
there
had
been
an
agreement
for
concerted
action
because
the
defendants
did
not
produce
witnesses
under
their
control
who
were
in
a
position
to
testify
as
to
whether
there
had
been
agreements
or
concerted
actions.
now,
the
necessary
and
explicit
premise
of
that
decision
was
this
would
be
factual
testimony
and
it
would
be
anomalous,
i
submit,
to
hold
in
the
face
of
that
decision
that
if
such
witnesses
are
called
and
do
testify,
the
jury
maybe
allowed
to
rest
their
testimonies
aside
on
the
grounds
that
some
undisclosed
part
of
it
is
regarded
as
to
making
factual
contentions,
i
mean,
legal
contentions.
may
i
take
just
a
few
minutes
on
subject
of
costs,
profits,
unreasonable
profits,
unreasonable
prices.
one
of
the
most
amazing
aspects
of
this
case
was
the
extent
of
which
the
prosecution
was
based
on
the
constant
hammering
of
the
proposition
that
these
companies
made
too
much
money
and
that
that
necessarily
meant
with
their
prices
were
too
high.
whatever
reasons
were
advanced
for
the
admissibility
of
the
evidence
about
the
costs
and
profits,
those
reasons
were
not
what
was
put
to
the
jury
by
government
counsel,
were
unreasonably
high.
now
the
technique
chosen
for
showing
that
the
profits
were
so
high
was
to
take
their
manufacturing
cost
and
compare
that
with
the
selling
price
and
say
that
the
difference
is
profit.
the
manufacturing
cost
included
nothing
for
research
or
warehousing
and
distribution,
for
selling
and
promotion,
for
administrative
overhead,
for
taxes.
so,
everybody
knew
that
this
comparison
did
not
involve
a
comparison
which
could
show
true
profit.
the
government
had
available,
had
in
its
possession,
accounting
studies
which
were
designed
to
show
total
costs
and
true
profit.
it
declined
to
use
these
studies
but
hammered
away
at
this
production
cost,
selling
price
comparison,
and
in
the
opening
to
the
jury,
in
the
summation
with
play
cards,
with
magnified
tables
and
charts,
that
was
the
subject
that
was
dinned
into
the
jury
of
both
into
their
eyes
and
to
their
ears.
we
tried
as
best
we
could
to
stir
trial
away
from
the
question
of
the
fairness
of
profits
because
that
question
has
no
bearing
in
this
case.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
well,
mr.
justice
we
did
not.
our
plan
as
the
government
counsel
is
indicated
in
his
brief,
since
the
--
both
government
testimony
upon
which
the
defendants
were
going
to
rely
was
being
put
in
--
had
been
put
in
by
the
government.
we
wish
to
put
in
our
whole
case
of
this
part
of
the
government
case,
so
we
would
not
in
the
eyes
of
the
jury
be
protecting
the
trial
with
the
unnecessary
carrying
on
of
what
had
been
deducted.
we
did
in
the
course
of
cross
examination
seek
to
have
received
these
accounting
studies.
they
were
rejected
not
finally
but
at
that
time.
the
one
--
the
one
offered
by
pfizer
for
example,
was
rejected
on
the
grounds
that
the
government
needed
more
time
to
study
it.
the
government
had
had
it
for
over
seven
years
and
the
argument
that
it
should
not
be
received
at
that
stage
of
the
trial
because
the
government
needed
more
time
to
study
it
frankly
did
not
make
any
sense.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
no,
mr.
justice
we
did
not.
we
did
not
put
in
the
case
except
to
call
one
witness
to
put
in
one
exhibit.
well,
the
--
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
oh!
half-an-hour.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
about
14
hours,
a
great
deal
of
which
was
at
night.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
yes
sir.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
yes,
sir.
and
that
these
errors
not
taken
separately,
as
government
counsel
asserts,
but
looking
at
the
conduct
of
the
trial
as
a
whole,
the
charges
as
a
whole,
that
the
effect
of
it
was
to
produce
an
imbalance
from
the
evidence
favorable
to
the
defendants
was
downgraded
and
undercut
when
this
inflammatory
evidence
principally
relied
on
by
the
government
was
given
much
freer
scope,
the
effect
was
an
imbalance
which
in
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
resulted
in
the
denial
of
a
fair
trial.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
well,
if
this
mr.
justice
blackmun,
he
conceded
at
the
outset
that
the
government’s
evidence
was
not
particularly
strong,
at
least
not
overwhelming
as
the
way
you
characterized
it.
as
to
some
of
the
errors,
i
submit
he
did
not
disagree
that
they
were
errors
as
to
parke-davis
for
example,
but
he
said
that
it
appeared
to
him
that
it
wasn’t
necessary
to
reverse
on
the
ground
of
these
errors.
well,
i
submit
that
the
errors
were
fundamental
and
that
taken
together
they
did
result
in
an
imbalance
which
was
quite
hurtful
to
the
defense.
thank
you.
