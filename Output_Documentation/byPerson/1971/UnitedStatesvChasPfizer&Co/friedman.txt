mr.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
after
a
seven-week
trial,
a
jury
sitting
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
convicted
the
three
respondents,
charles
pfizer
&
son,
the
american
cyanamid
company,
and
the
bristol-myers
company
under
an
indictment
in
three
counts
with
violating
sections
1
and
2
of
the
sherman
act,
by
fixing
prices
and
excluding
competitors
in
a
market
known
as
broad-spectrum
antibiotic
drugs.
each
of
the
respondents
was
fined
the
maximum
of
$50,000.00
on
each
count,
a
total
of
$150,000.00
fine
on
each
respondent.
broad-spectrum
antibiotic
drugs
are
a
group
of
drugs
that
are
unusually,
it
came
in
fairly
recently,
because
they
are
effective
against
a
wide
variety
of
microbial
or
micro
biotic
bacterial
infection.
each
of
the
four
–-
the
three
respondents
in
this
case
plus
another
firm,
parke-davis,
that
was
not
indicted
had
a
broad-spectrum
antibiotic
drug
during
the
period
involved
in
this
case.
each
of
these
drugs
was
patented.
most
of
them
are
fairly
well-known.
one
that,
your
honors
are
probably
familiar
with.
it
is
something
called
aureomycin
which
in
fact
was
the
drug
of
cyanamid.
the
drug
that
is
principally
involved
in
this
case,
the
focus
of
this
case,
however,
is
the
last
of
these
broad-spectrum
antibiotics
to
come
on
the
market,
a
drug
called
tetracycline
and
the
basic
theory
of
the
government’s
case
in
this
case
was
that
the
respondents
together
with
the
upjohn
company
and
the
squibb
company
engaged
in
a
conspiracy
to
limit
access
to
the
broad-spectrum
antibiotic
market
and
to
fix
prices
on
broad-spectrum
antibiotic.
a
divided
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
reversed
this
conviction.
the
court
held
that
certain
errors
made
by
the
district
court
in
its
instructions
to
the
jury
required
a
new
trial
and
the
government
has
brought
this
case
here
on
certiorari
because
of
its
concern
over
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
reviewed
and
evaluated
the
instructions
in
this
case.
now,
we
think
as
i
shall
develop
that
the
basic
error
committed
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
was
in
its
failure
to
view
the
instructions
in
their
entirety
in
the
context
of
the
entire
case.
mr.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice.
we
think
--
but
we’re
suggesting
--
we’re
asking
this
court
to
hold
that
the
court
of
appeals
applied
the
wrong
standard
in
considering
the
validity
of
this
charge,
that’s
all.
we’re
not
asking
this
court
of
course
to
substitute
its
judgment
for
that
of
the
court
of
appeals.
and
the
flaw
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
committed
in
this
case
was
that
--
it
didn’t
look
at
the
thing
in
the
context,
it
found
particular
phrases
which
it
thought
were
improper.
it
said
that
the
judge
had
not
stressed
certain
factors
sufficiently
and
stressed
others
too
much,
that
this
is
the
basic
flaw
we
think
that
was
committed
which
outcome
to
develop.
now,
there’s
no
question
in
this
case
as
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
as
to
what
happened.
the
problem
in
this
case
is
as
to
what
inferences
should
be
drawn
from
the
circumstantial
evidence.
mr.
friedman
well,
i
think
it’s
a
fair
way
to
put
the
standard
is
to
see
whether
--
looked
at
as
a
whole.
the
charge
properly
put
to
the
jury,
the
job
it
was
to
do,
explain
to
it,
the
basis
on
which
it
was
to
decide
the
case.
that
is
obviously
in
hindsight,
various
judges,
appellate
judges
may
decide
that
it
would’ve
been
better
to
state
one
thing,
one
way
rather
than
the
other
way.
if
they
had
been
charging
the
jury,
they
would’ve
emphasized
one
thing
rather
than
the
other,
but
i
think
the
basic
question,
the
basic
question
is
looked
at
as
a
whole
and
it
has
to
be
looked
at
also
in
the
light
of
all
the
evidence
before
the
jury
because
the
jury
obviously
considered
the
instructions
in
the
light
of
the
evidence
that
was
presented,
looked
at
as
the
--
in
the
--
as
a
whole
in
the
entire
case
that
this
charge
told
the
jury
what
it
were
suppose
to
do.
what
kinds
of
decisions
that
it
were
suppose
to
make,
on
what
basic
was
it
to
make
this
decision,
how
was
it
to
consider
this
voluminous
evidence
before,
and
i
think
that’s
the
thing
and
if
i
may
just
say
so,
with
all
due
respect
to
the
court
of
appeals,
this
is
a
lengthy
charge,
this
charge
occupies
65
pages
in
the
printed
record.
this
charge
took
the
district
judge,
judge
frankel
three
hours
to
develop,
to
deliver.
i
think
it
is
an
exemplary
charge.
i
really
think
it
is
completely
fair.
i
do
not
think
it
is
a
fair
criticism
of
it
that
it
may
have
swayed
the
jury.
the
judge
tried
to
do
everything
he
could
be
to
be
impartial
in
this
charge.
he
set
it
out
in
detail
and
indeed
the
court
of
appeals
at
no
point
suggested
that
there
was
any
legal
error
in
the
charge
in
the
sense
that
the
court
applied
the
wrong
legal
theories
or
anything
like
that.
it’s
just
basically,
basically
it
seems
to
us
that
what
you
have
here
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
here
substituting
its
judgment
for
that
of
the
trial
court
as
to
the
emphasis
to
be
given
to
particular
factors
as
to
the
way
in
which
certain
thing
should
be
said
and
of
course,
it
was
the
judge
who
presided
at
this
case
who
saw
all
the
evidence
who
is
really
in
the
best
position
to
know
how
to
frame
this
case
to
the
jury.
now,
if
i
may
just
briefly
indicate
what
the
facts
in
this
case
show.
during
the
period
of
the
indictment,
now
the
indictment
period
covered
from
1953
to
the
middle
of
1961,
pfizer
which
has
a
patent
on
tetracycline,
licensed
only
two
other
firms
to
make
tetracycline,
to
manufacture
it,
that
was
the
respondent
cyanamid
and
the
respondent
bristol.
it
also
licensed
only
those
two
plus
the
two
alleged
co-conspirators,
squibb
and
upjohn
to
sell
tetracycline.
this
is
all
alleged
in
the
indictment.
in
addition,
there
is
no
dispute
that
during
the
entire
period
of
this
indictment,
only
one
firm,
bristol,
sold
tetracycline
in
bulk
that
is
not
selling
it
to
the
drug
trade
in
the
normal
capsule
dosages,
which
are
other
dosages
of
selling
it
in
lump
product,
and
that
bristol,
sold
in
bulk
only
to
the
two
co-conspirators,
squibb
and
upjohn.
now,
in
addition
to
that,
the
evidence
shows
that
during
the
period
of
this
conspiracy,
most
of
this
period,
from
1953
to
1960
and
indeed
for
the
two
years
before
1963,
the
prices
of
all
five
of
the
conspirators,
on
all
four
broad
antibiotic
--
broad-spectrum
antibiotics
drugs
was
substantially
unchanged.
that
is
the
typical
example,
the
most
popular
dosage
form
was
a
bottle
containing
a
100
capsules
and
the
pricing
system
they
used
is
they
had
a
price
to
the
--
read
to
the
costumer,
to
the
person
who
gets
the
prescription
and
they
gave
discounts.
well,
throughout
this
period,
all
of
these
five
companies
on
all
these
four
antibiotic
drugs
charged
$30.60
to
the
druggist
for
this
100-capsule
bottle.
and
this
price
remained
static
for
a
nine-year
period,
despite
the
following
fact;
that
shares
of
the
market
shifted,
one
of
them
got
more,
the
other
one
got
less.
despite
the
fact
that
for
example
pfizer,
who
was
a
low
cost
producer
in
a
period
from
1958
to
1960,
saw
its
share
of
the
market
drop
from
22%
to
15%,
while
at
the
same
time,
upjohn
that
was
a
high
cost
producer
increased
its
share
from
15%
to
22%.
in
addition
to
which,
the
evidence
shows
that
there
where
substantial
cost
variations
among
the
five
co-conspirators
and
indeed,
the
cost
of
producing
these
drugs
during
this
period
was
rapidly
and
substantially
dropping,
but
despite
that
no
variation
in
the
prices.
now,
the
government's
theory
is,
the
government
developed,
i'll
develop
in
a
minute,
is
that
which
you
had
in
here
was
a
series
of
implied
agreements,
the
first
of
which
was
reached
between
pfizer
and
cyanamid
as
the
result
of
some
--
of
a
settlement
of
a
patent
interference,
preceding
in
1953,
and
then
another
series
of
agreements
reached
between
pfizer,
bristol,
squibb
and
upjohn
in
december
of
1955
when
patent
infringement
litigation
that
pfizer
had
brought
against
the
last
three
of
these
people
where
settled.
the,
as
i
say,
the
--
there's
no
question
what
happened
and
the
government's
theory
of
the
case
was
that
there
were
these
implied
understandings
and
agreements
under
which
each
parties
agreed,
first
that
only
the
three
respondents
would
--
would
be
licensed
to
manufacture
tetracycline.
secondly,
that
only
those
three
plus
squibb
and
upjohn
would
be
licensed
to
sell
it.
that
only
bristol
would
be
authorized,
who
had
been
permitted
to
sell
it
in
bulk
and
that
bristol
would
in
return
sell
only
the
squibb
and
upjohn.
that’s
one
element
and
secondly,
that
during
this
entire
period
they
agreed
to
and
did
maintain
identical
prices.
now,
the
question
before
the
jury,
the
question
before
the
jury
was
whether
this
admittedly
identical
conduct
and
all
of
these
things
that
happened,
whether
this
was
the
result
of
a
conspiracy,
of
an
agreement
or
an
understanding,
or
whether
it
was
the
result
of
independent
business
judgment
by
each
of
these
individual
firms
as
they
contend.
there
was
a
vast
amount
of
evidence
introduced
at
the
trial
on
this
issue.
this
is
where
these
typical
big
cases
that
we
get
frequently
in
the
antitrust
field,
the
record
that
is
spread
out
here
on
the
table
before
the
court
contains
21
volumes
of
printed
testimonies,
it's
more
than
12,000
pages.
there
was
detailed
and
comprehensive
evidence,
put
in
on
virtually
every
aspect
of
the
case;
evidence
relating
to
pricing,
relating
to
profits,
relating
to
negotiations
on
the
settling
of
these
patent
suits,
many
meetings
of
the
parties
had.
there
is
a
whole
great
deal
of
testimony
relating
to
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
issuance
of
the
patent
to
charles
pfizer
&
son
in
which
the
government
introduced
evidence
indicating
that
in
connection
with
obtaining
this
patent,
misleading
statements
have
been
made
to
the
patent
office
and
that
information
materials
for
the
patent
office’s
determination
had
been
withheld.
much
of
this
information
of
course
was
technically,
highly
scientific,
and
as
to
be
expected,
the
defendants
offered
detailed
explanations
as
to
why
they
did
what
they
did.
first,
their
offices
denied
there
had
been
any
agreements
or
understanding,
and
then
they
gave
lengthy
explanations
to
why
as
a
matter
of
business
judgment,
they
did
what
they
did.
and
the
court
repeatedly
told
the
jury
that
it
was
for
them
to
decide
on
the
basis
of
all
the
evidence,
of
all
the
evidence
whether
this
was
the
result
of
agreement
of
concerted
action
or
of
independent
business
judgment.
i
would
just
like
to
read
one
incidence
to
the
court,
one
excerpt
from
the
charge
at
page
4987
which
i
think
is
rather
typical
of
the
way
the
court
put
it
to
the
jury,
and
this
related
to
the
discussion
of
question
of
issuing
the
bulk,
bulk
sales,
making
bulk
sales
and
what
judge
frankel
charged
to
the
jury
was
all
relevant
evidence
and
your
recollection
of
it
will
be
part
of
your
consideration
as
you
undertake
to
consider
whether
this
situation
concerning
both
tetracycline
reflected
only
normal
and
lawful
business
conduct
by
the
several
companies
involved,
or
whether
it
tends
to
show
the
presence
of
the
conspiracy
the
government
alleges
or
whether
it
shows
nothing
either
way
and
that
same
theme
was
we
reiterated
by
the
judgment
as
charged
at
least
15
or
20
times
as
it
took
up
each
of
the
12
means
that
the
government
had
alleged
where
the
way
in
which
this
conspiracy
was
to
effect,
that
is
to
each
one
after
he
explained
the
theories,
explained
the
arguments,
explained
this
on
common
--
had
briefly
on
the
evidence,
he
then
pointed
out
it
was
in
the
final
analysis
for
the
jury
to
give
whatever
weight
they
thought
was
appropriate
to
that
evidence.
the
charge
we
think
was
an
exceptional
charge
as
i’ve
indicated
was
clear,
it
was
fair,
it
was
objective
and
explained
to
the
judge
--
jury
on
what
basis
they
reached
their
decision.
now,
we’ve
had
a
lengthy
briefs
in
this
case
in
which
they
discussed
it
considerable
length,
various
alleged
errors
in
the
charge.
obviously,
it
is
not
feasible
in
the
brief
composite
of
oral
argument
to
the
deal
with
them
in
detail
and
i
will
come
to
two
or
three
of
them
in
a
moment
that
are
listed,
but
i
just
like,
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
in
considering
the
sufficiency,
the
adequacy
of
the
charge
to
put
a
little
of
this
conspiracy
into
its
proper
factual
framework.
the
first
broad-spectrum
antibiotic
drug
came
on
the
market
in
1948,
and
by
1953,
there
were
three
broad-spectrum
drugs
available.
pfizer
had
one,
cyanamid
had
one
and
parke-davis,
which
the
government
said
was
not
a
conspirator
as
recognized
then
in
this
case
as
the
third
one.
in
1953
and
in
1952,
the
drug
that
parke-davis
had
had
gotten
some
unfortunate
medical
report,
as
a
result
of
which
it
sales
dropped
sharply.
in
1953,
pfizer
and
cyanamid
together
had
approximately
85%
of
the
broad-spectrum
antibiotic
market.
this
business
was
extremely
profitable
to
them,
represented
a
major
if
not
the
major
share
of
their
profit
and
was
also
a
major
part
of
their
total
sales.
now,
in
summer
of
1952,
tetracycline
was
discovered.
word
of
it
got
around
in
the
industry
and
it
became
quite
apparent
that
this
was
a
great
advance
in
the
broad-spectrum
antibiotic
field,
and
a
drug
that
was
likely
to
catch
on
very
quickly
and
within
two
years
after
its
introduction,
i
think
it
had
something
like
50%
of
the
broad-spectrum
antibiotics.
but
the
existence
of
tetracycline,
of
course,
threatened
the
market
position
that
pfizer
and
cyanamid
had
at
that
time
because
if
this
were
a
superior
drug,
and
if
in
fact
this
drug
was
not
patentable,
it
could
not
be
patented,
and
this
drug
came
on
the
market
with
no
patent
protection,
it
was
obvious,
it
would
properly
be
widely
sold
and
a
number
of
companies
would
come
into
it,
and
what
you
would
have
basically,
the
writing
indicates,
what
you
had
in
the
case
of
penicillin.
penicillin
was
not
a
patented
drug.
penicillin
had
a
lot
of
sellers,
the
price
went
down
and
down
and
down
and
the
result
of
this,
just
for
example,
bristol
at
the
time,
we
say
it
joined
the
conspiracy
in
1955,
practically
its
whole
business
was
penicillin.
it
was
loosing
a
lot
of
money,
it
was
desperate
to
strike.
pfizer,
cyanamid
and
bristol,
each
filed
patent
application;
one,
beginning
in
1952
and
continued
to
1953,
and
pfizer
and
cyanamid
had
reason
to
believe
that
an
interference
was
about
to
be
declared
at
the
patent
office,
that
is
that
patent
office
was
going
to
determine
which
of
these
have
priority
of
invention.
so,
they
got
together
and
settled
the
case
and
they
settled
it
on
a
basis
that
they
would
exchange
proofs
of
priority
which
ever
one
turned
out
to
be
the
winner
would
get
the
patent,
the
winner
would
license
the
looser,
they
would
exchange
know
how
and
in
addition
at
this
point,
pfizer
had
no
tetracycline,
only
cyanamid
did,
and
cyanamid
agreed
to
sell
to
pfizer
a
very
large
amount
of
bulk
tetracycline
to
enable
pfizer
to
get
right
on
the
market
because
pfizer
was
concerned
that
if
it
did
not
have
immediate
tetracycline
while
cyanamid
did,
cyanamid
would
get
what
they
call
le
con
(ph).
they’d
get
their
product
under
the
market.
they
would
get
the
doctors
used
to
prescribing
this
and
this
would
result
in
putting
them
at
a
tremendous
disadvantage.
they
sold
them
a
supply
of
many
months.
it
came
to
a
total
of
$3,800,000.00
and
they
begun
to
shipping
this
drug
even
before
the
interference
was
declared.
well,
things
didn’t
work
out
quite
as
they
had
thought.
originally,
after
pfizer,
let
me
go
back
on
it,
they
did
this,
they
exchanged
proofs
and
cyanamid
conceded
priority
to
pfizer,
pfizer
claimed
the
concession.
at
this
point,
pfizer
anticipated
that
it
would
be
shortly
getting
the
patent
and
it
was
around
this
point
that
the
chief
executive
officer
of
pfizer
had
a
meeting
in
his
plant
with
a
group
of
securities
analysts
and
after
the
end
of
the
meeting,
there
was
some
questions
and
answers
and
he
was
asked,
did
you
got
the
patent,
would
they
licensed
others,
and
he
said,
no,
we’ll
not
licensed
anyone
other
than
cyanamid,
a
report
that
was
widely
spread
in
the
drug
trade.
well,
things
don’t
always
work
out
as
planned
because
despite
their
best
hopes
the
patent
office
to
declared
an
interference,
not
only
with
two
of
these
patents,
but
also
with
bristol
and
then
several
months
later,
the
examiner
came
down
with
the
decision
in
which
he
said,
he
was
going
to
dissolve
the
interference
and
rule
that
the
tetracycline
wasn’t
patented
at
all.
it
was
not
patentable
at
all
because
he
said,
he
surmised
that
tetracycline
was
co-produced
with
cyanamid’s
broad-spectrum
antibiotic
aureomycin
and
the
process
by
which
these
companies
were
manufacturing
tetracycline
was
to
subject
aureomycin
to
some
further
things,
in
effect
extract
out
of
it
the
tetracycline,
they
changed
its
molecular
structure.
this
of
course
posed
a
great
threat
to
both
of
them,
and
it
was
after
this
thing
that
pfizer
set
out
to
try
to
persuade
the
examiner
to
change
his
mind,
that
he
was
wrong,
that
in
fact,
to
prove
to
him
that
tetracycline
was
not
produced
together
with
aureomycin
and
this
is
where
they
made
the
misrepresentations,
relied
on
certain
misstatements
that
cyanamid
had
made.
now,
under
the
licensing
agreement
that
pfizer
and
cyanamid
had
in
settling
the
interference,
when,
as
soon
as
the
pfizer
patent
was
issued,
pfizer
was
to
license
cyanamid
and
cyanamid
was
to
pay
2.5%
royalties
on
all
the
tetracycline
it
sold.
well,
one
might
wonder
why
cyanamid
who
would
immediately
be
subject
to
paying
royalties
upon
the
grant
of
the
license
to
pfizer
would
attempt
to
help
pfizer
and
to
press
for
a
license
to
pfizer
and
cyanamid’s
private
counsel
in
this
testimony
explained
quite
candidly
why,
in
a
little
passage
quoted
at
the
top
of
page
16
of
our
brief.
it
said,
the
reason
it
was
important
to
cyanamid
to
see
that
the
patent
issue
to
pfizer
was
he
explained,
we
wouldn’t
have
people
like
bristol
in
the
market
for
one,
we
wouldn’t
have
the
italians
importing
it
over
here
for
another
and
of
course
anybody
with
no
patent
on
tetracycline,
any
tom,
dick
and
harry
with
a
little
bit
of
money
could
get
into
the
business
and
the
government's
theory
which
was
presented
to
the
jury
was
that
this
whole
thing
was
part
and
parcel
of
an
implied
understanding
between
pfizer
and
cyanamid
when
they
settled
the
interference
proceeding
that
they
would
limit
licensing
to
the
looser
before
the
patent
office
and
that
they
would
set
non-competitive
and
fixed
prices
on
the
sale
of
tetracycline
and
thereby
in
effect
preserving
the
position
they
had.
now,
these
different
aspects
of
the
case
of
course
are
all
interrelated
because
the
only
way
that
the
price
structure
could
be
kept
up,
the
only
way
that
prices
could
be
kept
high
was
if
you
are
sure
that
you
didn’t
have
any
other
people
coming
into
the
industry
who
would
cut
the
prices
and
the
only
way
you
could
be
sure
that
no
one
else
could
get
into
the
industry
if
you
could
control
it
with
a
patent.
now
this
is
under
the
government's
theory
how
pfizer
and
cyanamid
began
the
conspiracy.
the
government
--
what
happened
was
bristol
which
at
this
point
had
no
broad-spectrum
antibiotic
and
was
in
desperate
financial
shape,
although
pfizer
had
warned
that
it
would
sue
anyone
for
infringement
who
manufactured
the
drug,
in
the
summer
of
1954,
began
itself
to
sell
tetracycline
under
its
own
brand
and
then
in
september
of
that
year,
it
gave
licenses
to
squibb
and
upjohn,
the
two
co-conspirators,
i’m
sorry,
it
didn’t
give
the
license,
it
sold,
it
sold
tetracycline
that
it
had
bulk
to
these
two
firms.
the
day
that
the
pfizer
patent
was
issued,
pfizer
sued
bristol,
squibb
and
upjohn
for
patent
infringement.
the
three
of
them
filed
answers
in
which
they
challenged
the
validity
of
the
patent
asserting
among
other
things
that
had
been
procured
by
misrepresentations
in
the
patent
office,
the
response
of
pfizer
to
this
was
to
sue
the
three
of
them
for
tremendous
damages.
it
sought
15
million
from
bristol,
30
million
from
upjohn,
6
million
from
squibb.
at
this
point
the
suit
was
being
contested
rather
frivolously.
now,
later
in
1955,
bristol
got
word
that
upjohn
had
been
talking
to
pfizer
about
possibly
settling
the
patent
suit.
upjohn
was
quite
concerned
about
this
$30
million
potential
liability
and
then
we
had
a
series
of
agreements
which
led
to
determination
for
pfizer
litigation.
first,
their
agreements
between
bristol
on
the
one
hand
and
squibb
and
upjohn
on
the
other
under
which
squibb
and
upjohn
gave
bristol
the
authority
to
settle
and
handle
the
pfizer
litigation.
mr.
friedman
no,
it
does
not.
indeed,
by
implication
the
court
presumably
thought
that
the
evidence
was
sufficient
because
it
sent
it
back
for
a
new
trial,
and
if
it
felt
that
the
evidence
was
insufficient,
but
i
think
these
facts
on
bringing
out
a
meaningful
and
helpful
in
terms
of
some
of
the
objections
they
raised
to
the
charge.
so
--
and
in
the
course
of
this
licensing,
this,
i
am
sorry,
from
the
course
of
this
agreement
under
which
bristol
is
authorized
to
handle
the
pfizer
and
squibb
interests
in
settling,
negotiating,
and
conducting
the
litigations
against
pfizer.
there
was
a
statement
in
there
that
any
license
that
bristol
obtained
for
squibb
and
upjohn
during
the
course
of
the
litigation,
during
the
course
of
the
settlement,
might
be
limited,
however,
to
giving
squibb
and
upjohn
the
right,
the
right
to
sell
and
use,
but
not
to
manufacture.
so
in
addition
to
which
squibb
and
upjohn
were
bound,
were
bound
under
this
agreement
for
the
duration
of
the
litigation
with
pfizer,
the
patent
litigation
and
three
years
thereafter
to
purchase
all
their
requirements
of
tetracycline
from
bristol.
so
at
this
point
bristol
had
the
thing
locked
up
in
the
sense
that
it
had
control
of
the
litigation.
it
was
protected
that
squibb
and
upjohn
couldn’t
settle
themselves
with
pfizer
and
perhaps
purchasing
both
from
pfizer
and
therefore
loosing
a
customer
and
at
the
same
time
it
had
put
in
there
a
provision
that
would
protect
it
from
having
to
give
its
two
major
customers,
squibb
and
upjohn,
the
right
to
manufacture
and
thus
oust
this
important
sort
of
business.
now,
ultimately
the
litigation
was
settled
and
the
settlement
was
precipitated
by
the
fact
that
there
was,
brought
out
shortly
before
the
settlement,
the
fact
that
a
detective
who
was
paid
by
the
general
counsel
of
pfizer
had
undertaken
to
tap
the
telephones
of
bristol
and
squibb.
and
when
this
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
pfizer,
pfizer
immediately
said
let's
get
together
and
settle
it,
and
they
settled
it
and
they
settled
it
as
i
have
indicated
that
a
license
was
given
to
squibb
and
upjohn
to
make
use
in
sales
of
the
drug
trade
and
a
license
was
given
to
bristol
to
manufacture
using
itself.
now,
during
the
period,
thereafter,
from
--
i
mean,
for
the
whole
period
to
the
end
of
the
conspiracy,
no
one
else
was
licensed
other
than
these
five
people.
no
one
sold
in
bulk
other
than
bristol
and
during
the
same
period
there
were
ten
requests
made
for
licenses
or
for
both
sales
of
tetracycline
and
they
were
rejected.
now,
let
me
just
very
briefly
refer
one
or
two
of
the
grounds
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
this
charge
was
insufficient.
let
me
take
the
major
argument
that
the
respondents
make
here.
parke-davis
was
not
a
conspirator.
parke-davis
during
the
period
of
the
conspiracy
did
many
of
the
things
that
the
government
said
when
done
by
the
three
respondents
as
part
of
the
conspiracy,
they
followed
the
same
prices,
they
did
not
grant
licenses
to
start
with.
and
the
theory
of
the
respondents
in
this
case,
one
of
their
principle
defenses
was
that
parke-davis
is
doing
the
same
things,
admittedly
not
pursuant
to
a
conspiracy
as
these
conspirators
had
done
with
strong
evidence
that
in
fact
this
identical
conduct
was
a
result
of
independent
business
judgment,
but
not
and
not
agreement
of
concerted
action.
the
government
of
course
pointed
to
the
fact
that
parke-davis
in
many
respects
had
not
done
the
same
thing.
parke-davis
for
one
thing
was
not
in
tetracycline.
secondly,
parke-davis
gave
no
licenses.
parke-davis
was
not
involved
in
any
of
the
patent
litigations
and
the
various
negotiations.
the
district
court
charged
the
jury
at
length
about
this
issue.
it
pointed
out
that
they
had
heard
a
lot
of
evidence
with
respect
to
parke-davis.
that
parke-davis
in
some
respect
was
similar
that
in
other
respect,
it
was
dissimilar.
it
pointed
out
that
parke-davis
was
not
indicted
and
it
urged
the
jury,
told
the
jury,
this
is
one
of
the
factors
they
have
to
take
into
consideration.
the
judge
refused
an
instruction
which
the
respondents
tended
and
which
the
respondents
wanted
them
to
line
up
the
dissimilarities,
i
am
sorry
the
similarities
between
parke-davis’
conduct
and
that
of
the
respondents.
the
judge
refused
to
do
that.
he
said
“that
would
be
quite
correct
and
we
think
that
would
be
an
unfair
charge,
that
would
be
a
loaded
charge”
because
if
they
have
to
charge
on
the
similarities
i
should
also
charge
on
the
dissimilarities.
they
also
objected
because
they
--
and
the
court
of
appeals
criticized
the
cause
of
the
district
court
for
not
permitting
an
instruction
on
the
presumption
of
innocence.
they
wanted
the
judge
to
instruct
on
a
presumption
of
innocence,
that
parke-davis
not
a
defendant
was
presumed
innocent.
the
judge
said
that
presumption
of
innocence
relates
to
the
defendants
and
there
was
no
occasion
to
instruct
on
the
presumption
of
other
persons
that
parke-davis
was
not
indicted
and
that
is
as
far
as
no
need
for
the
jury
to
speculate
it
on
why
they
had
not
been
indicted.
and
had
the
judge
given
the
instructions
that
the
respondents
submitted,
this
could
have
engendered
a
further
problem
of
confusion
because
the
jury
might
then,
despite
other
instructions
have
drawn
some
interest,
drawn
some
inference,
that
the
fact
that
the
respondents
were
indicted
was
itself
of
significance.
i’d
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
friedman
one
minute,
well,
i’ll
try
to
be
very
rapid.
first,
mr.
justice
brennan,
the
arguments
for
the
jury
is
set
forth
at
length
at
page
4719
to
4913.
mr.
friedman
4719
to
4913.
secondly,
i’d
like
to
refer
the
court
to
pages
60
to
65
of
our
brief
in
which
we
argue
that
parke-davis
and
the
other
defendants
were
not
inhibited
from
making
to
the
jury
the
arguments
on
parke-davis,
that
we
argue
this
was
basically
a
judgment
strategy
judgment
made
by
themselves
and
finally,
i
just
like
to
say
that
we
disagree.
we
disagree
with
mr.
wood’s
arguments
that
somehow
this
charge
denigrated
the
evidence
that
was
favorable
to
the
defendants
and
stressed
the
inflammatory
and
prejudicial
thing.
we
think
this
is
a
fair
charge
and
all
i
can
urge
upon
the
court
is
that
when
it
reads
the
charge,
when
it
reads
charge,
it
seems
to
me
as
completely
objective.
they’ve
discussed
all
of
these
evidence.
they've
recognized
the
problems
on
the
costs
which
mr.
wood
is
referred.
the
court
specifically
pointed
out
to
the
jury
that
the
cost
figures,
the
difference
between
factory
cost
and
selling
price
did
not
take
account
of
many
other
items
of
course
and
that
was
extensively
brought
out
in
the
examination
for
witness
and
the
court
charged
the
jury,
that
those
were
factors
to
be
taken
into
account.
thank
you.
mr.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
after
a
seven-week
trial,
a
jury
sitting
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
convicted
the
three
respondents,
charles
pfizer
&
son,
the
american
cyanamid
company,
and
the
bristol-myers
company
under
an
indictment
in
three
counts
with
violating
sections
1
and
2
of
the
sherman
act,
by
fixing
prices
and
excluding
competitors
in
a
market
known
as
broad-spectrum
antibiotic
drugs.
each
of
the
respondents
was
fined
the
maximum
of
$50,000.00
on
each
count,
a
total
of
$150,000.00
fine
on
each
respondent.
broad-spectrum
antibiotic
drugs
are
a
group
of
drugs
that
are
unusually,
it
came
in
fairly
recently,
because
they
are
effective
against
a
wide
variety
of
microbial
or
micro
biotic
bacterial
infection.
each
of
the
four
–-
the
three
respondents
in
this
case
plus
another
firm,
parke-davis,
that
was
not
indicted
had
a
broad-spectrum
antibiotic
drug
during
the
period
involved
in
this
case.
each
of
these
drugs
was
patented.
most
of
them
are
fairly
well-known.
one
that,
your
honors
are
probably
familiar
with.
it
is
something
called
aureomycin
which
in
fact
was
the
drug
of
cyanamid.
the
drug
that
is
principally
involved
in
this
case,
the
focus
of
this
case,
however,
is
the
last
of
these
broad-spectrum
antibiotics
to
come
on
the
market,
a
drug
called
tetracycline
and
the
basic
theory
of
the
government’s
case
in
this
case
was
that
the
respondents
together
with
the
upjohn
company
and
the
squibb
company
engaged
in
a
conspiracy
to
limit
access
to
the
broad-spectrum
antibiotic
market
and
to
fix
prices
on
broad-spectrum
antibiotic.
a
divided
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
reversed
this
conviction.
the
court
held
that
certain
errors
made
by
the
district
court
in
its
instructions
to
the
jury
required
a
new
trial
and
the
government
has
brought
this
case
here
on
certiorari
because
of
its
concern
over
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
reviewed
and
evaluated
the
instructions
in
this
case.
now,
we
think
as
i
shall
develop
that
the
basic
error
committed
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
was
in
its
failure
to
view
the
instructions
in
their
entirety
in
the
context
of
the
entire
case.
mr.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice.
we
think
--
but
we’re
suggesting
--
we’re
asking
this
court
to
hold
that
the
court
of
appeals
applied
the
wrong
standard
in
considering
the
validity
of
this
charge,
that’s
all.
we’re
not
asking
this
court
of
course
to
substitute
its
judgment
for
that
of
the
court
of
appeals.
and
the
flaw
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
committed
in
this
case
was
that
--
it
didn’t
look
at
the
thing
in
the
context,
it
found
particular
phrases
which
it
thought
were
improper.
it
said
that
the
judge
had
not
stressed
certain
factors
sufficiently
and
stressed
others
too
much,
that
this
is
the
basic
flaw
we
think
that
was
committed
which
outcome
to
develop.
now,
there’s
no
question
in
this
case
as
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
as
to
what
happened.
the
problem
in
this
case
is
as
to
what
inferences
should
be
drawn
from
the
circumstantial
evidence.
mr.
friedman
well,
i
think
it’s
a
fair
way
to
put
the
standard
is
to
see
whether
--
looked
at
as
a
whole.
the
charge
properly
put
to
the
jury,
the
job
it
was
to
do,
explain
to
it,
the
basis
on
which
it
was
to
decide
the
case.
that
is
obviously
in
hindsight,
various
judges,
appellate
judges
may
decide
that
it
would’ve
been
better
to
state
one
thing,
one
way
rather
than
the
other
way.
if
they
had
been
charging
the
jury,
they
would’ve
emphasized
one
thing
rather
than
the
other,
but
i
think
the
basic
question,
the
basic
question
is
looked
at
as
a
whole
and
it
has
to
be
looked
at
also
in
the
light
of
all
the
evidence
before
the
jury
because
the
jury
obviously
considered
the
instructions
in
the
light
of
the
evidence
that
was
presented,
looked
at
as
the
--
in
the
--
as
a
whole
in
the
entire
case
that
this
charge
told
the
jury
what
it
were
suppose
to
do.
what
kinds
of
decisions
that
it
were
suppose
to
make,
on
what
basic
was
it
to
make
this
decision,
how
was
it
to
consider
this
voluminous
evidence
before,
and
i
think
that’s
the
thing
and
if
i
may
just
say
so,
with
all
due
respect
to
the
court
of
appeals,
this
is
a
lengthy
charge,
this
charge
occupies
65
pages
in
the
printed
record.
this
charge
took
the
district
judge,
judge
frankel
three
hours
to
develop,
to
deliver.
i
think
it
is
an
exemplary
charge.
i
really
think
it
is
completely
fair.
i
do
not
think
it
is
a
fair
criticism
of
it
that
it
may
have
swayed
the
jury.
the
judge
tried
to
do
everything
he
could
be
to
be
impartial
in
this
charge.
he
set
it
out
in
detail
and
indeed
the
court
of
appeals
at
no
point
suggested
that
there
was
any
legal
error
in
the
charge
in
the
sense
that
the
court
applied
the
wrong
legal
theories
or
anything
like
that.
it’s
just
basically,
basically
it
seems
to
us
that
what
you
have
here
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
here
substituting
its
judgment
for
that
of
the
trial
court
as
to
the
emphasis
to
be
given
to
particular
factors
as
to
the
way
in
which
certain
thing
should
be
said
and
of
course,
it
was
the
judge
who
presided
at
this
case
who
saw
all
the
evidence
who
is
really
in
the
best
position
to
know
how
to
frame
this
case
to
the
jury.
now,
if
i
may
just
briefly
indicate
what
the
facts
in
this
case
show.
during
the
period
of
the
indictment,
now
the
indictment
period
covered
from
1953
to
the
middle
of
1961,
pfizer
which
has
a
patent
on
tetracycline,
licensed
only
two
other
firms
to
make
tetracycline,
to
manufacture
it,
that
was
the
respondent
cyanamid
and
the
respondent
bristol.
it
also
licensed
only
those
two
plus
the
two
alleged
co-conspirators,
squibb
and
upjohn
to
sell
tetracycline.
this
is
all
alleged
in
the
indictment.
in
addition,
there
is
no
dispute
that
during
the
entire
period
of
this
indictment,
only
one
firm,
bristol,
sold
tetracycline
in
bulk
that
is
not
selling
it
to
the
drug
trade
in
the
normal
capsule
dosages,
which
are
other
dosages
of
selling
it
in
lump
product,
and
that
bristol,
sold
in
bulk
only
to
the
two
co-conspirators,
squibb
and
upjohn.
now,
in
addition
to
that,
the
evidence
shows
that
during
the
period
of
this
conspiracy,
most
of
this
period,
from
1953
to
1960
and
indeed
for
the
two
years
before
1963,
the
prices
of
all
five
of
the
conspirators,
on
all
four
broad
antibiotic
--
broad-spectrum
antibiotics
drugs
was
substantially
unchanged.
that
is
the
typical
example,
the
most
popular
dosage
form
was
a
bottle
containing
a
100
capsules
and
the
pricing
system
they
used
is
they
had
a
price
to
the
--
read
to
the
costumer,
to
the
person
who
gets
the
prescription
and
they
gave
discounts.
well,
throughout
this
period,
all
of
these
five
companies
on
all
these
four
antibiotic
drugs
charged
$30.60
to
the
druggist
for
this
100-capsule
bottle.
and
this
price
remained
static
for
a
nine-year
period,
despite
the
following
fact;
that
shares
of
the
market
shifted,
one
of
them
got
more,
the
other
one
got
less.
despite
the
fact
that
for
example
pfizer,
who
was
a
low
cost
producer
in
a
period
from
1958
to
1960,
saw
its
share
of
the
market
drop
from
22%
to
15%,
while
at
the
same
time,
upjohn
that
was
a
high
cost
producer
increased
its
share
from
15%
to
22%.
in
addition
to
which,
the
evidence
shows
that
there
where
substantial
cost
variations
among
the
five
co-conspirators
and
indeed,
the
cost
of
producing
these
drugs
during
this
period
was
rapidly
and
substantially
dropping,
but
despite
that
no
variation
in
the
prices.
now,
the
government's
theory
is,
the
government
developed,
i'll
develop
in
a
minute,
is
that
which
you
had
in
here
was
a
series
of
implied
agreements,
the
first
of
which
was
reached
between
pfizer
and
cyanamid
as
the
result
of
some
--
of
a
settlement
of
a
patent
interference,
preceding
in
1953,
and
then
another
series
of
agreements
reached
between
pfizer,
bristol,
squibb
and
upjohn
in
december
of
1955
when
patent
infringement
litigation
that
pfizer
had
brought
against
the
last
three
of
these
people
where
settled.
the,
as
i
say,
the
--
there's
no
question
what
happened
and
the
government's
theory
of
the
case
was
that
there
were
these
implied
understandings
and
agreements
under
which
each
parties
agreed,
first
that
only
the
three
respondents
would
--
would
be
licensed
to
manufacture
tetracycline.
secondly,
that
only
those
three
plus
squibb
and
upjohn
would
be
licensed
to
sell
it.
that
only
bristol
would
be
authorized,
who
had
been
permitted
to
sell
it
in
bulk
and
that
bristol
would
in
return
sell
only
the
squibb
and
upjohn.
that’s
one
element
and
secondly,
that
during
this
entire
period
they
agreed
to
and
did
maintain
identical
prices.
now,
the
question
before
the
jury,
the
question
before
the
jury
was
whether
this
admittedly
identical
conduct
and
all
of
these
things
that
happened,
whether
this
was
the
result
of
a
conspiracy,
of
an
agreement
or
an
understanding,
or
whether
it
was
the
result
of
independent
business
judgment
by
each
of
these
individual
firms
as
they
contend.
there
was
a
vast
amount
of
evidence
introduced
at
the
trial
on
this
issue.
this
is
where
these
typical
big
cases
that
we
get
frequently
in
the
antitrust
field,
the
record
that
is
spread
out
here
on
the
table
before
the
court
contains
21
volumes
of
printed
testimonies,
it's
more
than
12,000
pages.
there
was
detailed
and
comprehensive
evidence,
put
in
on
virtually
every
aspect
of
the
case;
evidence
relating
to
pricing,
relating
to
profits,
relating
to
negotiations
on
the
settling
of
these
patent
suits,
many
meetings
of
the
parties
had.
there
is
a
whole
great
deal
of
testimony
relating
to
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
issuance
of
the
patent
to
charles
pfizer
&
son
in
which
the
government
introduced
evidence
indicating
that
in
connection
with
obtaining
this
patent,
misleading
statements
have
been
made
to
the
patent
office
and
that
information
materials
for
the
patent
office’s
determination
had
been
withheld.
much
of
this
information
of
course
was
technically,
highly
scientific,
and
as
to
be
expected,
the
defendants
offered
detailed
explanations
as
to
why
they
did
what
they
did.
first,
their
offices
denied
there
had
been
any
agreements
or
understanding,
and
then
they
gave
lengthy
explanations
to
why
as
a
matter
of
business
judgment,
they
did
what
they
did.
and
the
court
repeatedly
told
the
jury
that
it
was
for
them
to
decide
on
the
basis
of
all
the
evidence,
of
all
the
evidence
whether
this
was
the
result
of
agreement
of
concerted
action
or
of
independent
business
judgment.
i
would
just
like
to
read
one
incidence
to
the
court,
one
excerpt
from
the
charge
at
page
4987
which
i
think
is
rather
typical
of
the
way
the
court
put
it
to
the
jury,
and
this
related
to
the
discussion
of
question
of
issuing
the
bulk,
bulk
sales,
making
bulk
sales
and
what
judge
frankel
charged
to
the
jury
was
all
relevant
evidence
and
your
recollection
of
it
will
be
part
of
your
consideration
as
you
undertake
to
consider
whether
this
situation
concerning
both
tetracycline
reflected
only
normal
and
lawful
business
conduct
by
the
several
companies
involved,
or
whether
it
tends
to
show
the
presence
of
the
conspiracy
the
government
alleges
or
whether
it
shows
nothing
either
way
and
that
same
theme
was
we
reiterated
by
the
judgment
as
charged
at
least
15
or
20
times
as
it
took
up
each
of
the
12
means
that
the
government
had
alleged
where
the
way
in
which
this
conspiracy
was
to
effect,
that
is
to
each
one
after
he
explained
the
theories,
explained
the
arguments,
explained
this
on
common
--
had
briefly
on
the
evidence,
he
then
pointed
out
it
was
in
the
final
analysis
for
the
jury
to
give
whatever
weight
they
thought
was
appropriate
to
that
evidence.
the
charge
we
think
was
an
exceptional
charge
as
i’ve
indicated
was
clear,
it
was
fair,
it
was
objective
and
explained
to
the
judge
--
jury
on
what
basis
they
reached
their
decision.
now,
we’ve
had
a
lengthy
briefs
in
this
case
in
which
they
discussed
it
considerable
length,
various
alleged
errors
in
the
charge.
obviously,
it
is
not
feasible
in
the
brief
composite
of
oral
argument
to
the
deal
with
them
in
detail
and
i
will
come
to
two
or
three
of
them
in
a
moment
that
are
listed,
but
i
just
like,
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
in
considering
the
sufficiency,
the
adequacy
of
the
charge
to
put
a
little
of
this
conspiracy
into
its
proper
factual
framework.
the
first
broad-spectrum
antibiotic
drug
came
on
the
market
in
1948,
and
by
1953,
there
were
three
broad-spectrum
drugs
available.
pfizer
had
one,
cyanamid
had
one
and
parke-davis,
which
the
government
said
was
not
a
conspirator
as
recognized
then
in
this
case
as
the
third
one.
in
1953
and
in
1952,
the
drug
that
parke-davis
had
had
gotten
some
unfortunate
medical
report,
as
a
result
of
which
it
sales
dropped
sharply.
in
1953,
pfizer
and
cyanamid
together
had
approximately
85%
of
the
broad-spectrum
antibiotic
market.
this
business
was
extremely
profitable
to
them,
represented
a
major
if
not
the
major
share
of
their
profit
and
was
also
a
major
part
of
their
total
sales.
now,
in
summer
of
1952,
tetracycline
was
discovered.
word
of
it
got
around
in
the
industry
and
it
became
quite
apparent
that
this
was
a
great
advance
in
the
broad-spectrum
antibiotic
field,
and
a
drug
that
was
likely
to
catch
on
very
quickly
and
within
two
years
after
its
introduction,
i
think
it
had
something
like
50%
of
the
broad-spectrum
antibiotics.
but
the
existence
of
tetracycline,
of
course,
threatened
the
market
position
that
pfizer
and
cyanamid
had
at
that
time
because
if
this
were
a
superior
drug,
and
if
in
fact
this
drug
was
not
patentable,
it
could
not
be
patented,
and
this
drug
came
on
the
market
with
no
patent
protection,
it
was
obvious,
it
would
properly
be
widely
sold
and
a
number
of
companies
would
come
into
it,
and
what
you
would
have
basically,
the
writing
indicates,
what
you
had
in
the
case
of
penicillin.
penicillin
was
not
a
patented
drug.
penicillin
had
a
lot
of
sellers,
the
price
went
down
and
down
and
down
and
the
result
of
this,
just
for
example,
bristol
at
the
time,
we
say
it
joined
the
conspiracy
in
1955,
practically
its
whole
business
was
penicillin.
it
was
loosing
a
lot
of
money,
it
was
desperate
to
strike.
pfizer,
cyanamid
and
bristol,
each
filed
patent
application;
one,
beginning
in
1952
and
continued
to
1953,
and
pfizer
and
cyanamid
had
reason
to
believe
that
an
interference
was
about
to
be
declared
at
the
patent
office,
that
is
that
patent
office
was
going
to
determine
which
of
these
have
priority
of
invention.
so,
they
got
together
and
settled
the
case
and
they
settled
it
on
a
basis
that
they
would
exchange
proofs
of
priority
which
ever
one
turned
out
to
be
the
winner
would
get
the
patent,
the
winner
would
license
the
looser,
they
would
exchange
know
how
and
in
addition
at
this
point,
pfizer
had
no
tetracycline,
only
cyanamid
did,
and
cyanamid
agreed
to
sell
to
pfizer
a
very
large
amount
of
bulk
tetracycline
to
enable
pfizer
to
get
right
on
the
market
because
pfizer
was
concerned
that
if
it
did
not
have
immediate
tetracycline
while
cyanamid
did,
cyanamid
would
get
what
they
call
le
con
(ph).
they’d
get
their
product
under
the
market.
they
would
get
the
doctors
used
to
prescribing
this
and
this
would
result
in
putting
them
at
a
tremendous
disadvantage.
they
sold
them
a
supply
of
many
months.
it
came
to
a
total
of
$3,800,000.00
and
they
begun
to
shipping
this
drug
even
before
the
interference
was
declared.
well,
things
didn’t
work
out
quite
as
they
had
thought.
originally,
after
pfizer,
let
me
go
back
on
it,
they
did
this,
they
exchanged
proofs
and
cyanamid
conceded
priority
to
pfizer,
pfizer
claimed
the
concession.
at
this
point,
pfizer
anticipated
that
it
would
be
shortly
getting
the
patent
and
it
was
around
this
point
that
the
chief
executive
officer
of
pfizer
had
a
meeting
in
his
plant
with
a
group
of
securities
analysts
and
after
the
end
of
the
meeting,
there
was
some
questions
and
answers
and
he
was
asked,
did
you
got
the
patent,
would
they
licensed
others,
and
he
said,
no,
we’ll
not
licensed
anyone
other
than
cyanamid,
a
report
that
was
widely
spread
in
the
drug
trade.
well,
things
don’t
always
work
out
as
planned
because
despite
their
best
hopes
the
patent
office
to
declared
an
interference,
not
only
with
two
of
these
patents,
but
also
with
bristol
and
then
several
months
later,
the
examiner
came
down
with
the
decision
in
which
he
said,
he
was
going
to
dissolve
the
interference
and
rule
that
the
tetracycline
wasn’t
patented
at
all.
it
was
not
patentable
at
all
because
he
said,
he
surmised
that
tetracycline
was
co-produced
with
cyanamid’s
broad-spectrum
antibiotic
aureomycin
and
the
process
by
which
these
companies
were
manufacturing
tetracycline
was
to
subject
aureomycin
to
some
further
things,
in
effect
extract
out
of
it
the
tetracycline,
they
changed
its
molecular
structure.
this
of
course
posed
a
great
threat
to
both
of
them,
and
it
was
after
this
thing
that
pfizer
set
out
to
try
to
persuade
the
examiner
to
change
his
mind,
that
he
was
wrong,
that
in
fact,
to
prove
to
him
that
tetracycline
was
not
produced
together
with
aureomycin
and
this
is
where
they
made
the
misrepresentations,
relied
on
certain
misstatements
that
cyanamid
had
made.
now,
under
the
licensing
agreement
that
pfizer
and
cyanamid
had
in
settling
the
interference,
when,
as
soon
as
the
pfizer
patent
was
issued,
pfizer
was
to
license
cyanamid
and
cyanamid
was
to
pay
2.5%
royalties
on
all
the
tetracycline
it
sold.
well,
one
might
wonder
why
cyanamid
who
would
immediately
be
subject
to
paying
royalties
upon
the
grant
of
the
license
to
pfizer
would
attempt
to
help
pfizer
and
to
press
for
a
license
to
pfizer
and
cyanamid’s
private
counsel
in
this
testimony
explained
quite
candidly
why,
in
a
little
passage
quoted
at
the
top
of
page
16
of
our
brief.
it
said,
the
reason
it
was
important
to
cyanamid
to
see
that
the
patent
issue
to
pfizer
was
he
explained,
we
wouldn’t
have
people
like
bristol
in
the
market
for
one,
we
wouldn’t
have
the
italians
importing
it
over
here
for
another
and
of
course
anybody
with
no
patent
on
tetracycline,
any
tom,
dick
and
harry
with
a
little
bit
of
money
could
get
into
the
business
and
the
government's
theory
which
was
presented
to
the
jury
was
that
this
whole
thing
was
part
and
parcel
of
an
implied
understanding
between
pfizer
and
cyanamid
when
they
settled
the
interference
proceeding
that
they
would
limit
licensing
to
the
looser
before
the
patent
office
and
that
they
would
set
non-competitive
and
fixed
prices
on
the
sale
of
tetracycline
and
thereby
in
effect
preserving
the
position
they
had.
now,
these
different
aspects
of
the
case
of
course
are
all
interrelated
because
the
only
way
that
the
price
structure
could
be
kept
up,
the
only
way
that
prices
could
be
kept
high
was
if
you
are
sure
that
you
didn’t
have
any
other
people
coming
into
the
industry
who
would
cut
the
prices
and
the
only
way
you
could
be
sure
that
no
one
else
could
get
into
the
industry
if
you
could
control
it
with
a
patent.
now
this
is
under
the
government's
theory
how
pfizer
and
cyanamid
began
the
conspiracy.
the
government
--
what
happened
was
bristol
which
at
this
point
had
no
broad-spectrum
antibiotic
and
was
in
desperate
financial
shape,
although
pfizer
had
warned
that
it
would
sue
anyone
for
infringement
who
manufactured
the
drug,
in
the
summer
of
1954,
began
itself
to
sell
tetracycline
under
its
own
brand
and
then
in
september
of
that
year,
it
gave
licenses
to
squibb
and
upjohn,
the
two
co-conspirators,
i’m
sorry,
it
didn’t
give
the
license,
it
sold,
it
sold
tetracycline
that
it
had
bulk
to
these
two
firms.
the
day
that
the
pfizer
patent
was
issued,
pfizer
sued
bristol,
squibb
and
upjohn
for
patent
infringement.
the
three
of
them
filed
answers
in
which
they
challenged
the
validity
of
the
patent
asserting
among
other
things
that
had
been
procured
by
misrepresentations
in
the
patent
office,
the
response
of
pfizer
to
this
was
to
sue
the
three
of
them
for
tremendous
damages.
it
sought
15
million
from
bristol,
30
million
from
upjohn,
6
million
from
squibb.
at
this
point
the
suit
was
being
contested
rather
frivolously.
now,
later
in
1955,
bristol
got
word
that
upjohn
had
been
talking
to
pfizer
about
possibly
settling
the
patent
suit.
upjohn
was
quite
concerned
about
this
$30
million
potential
liability
and
then
we
had
a
series
of
agreements
which
led
to
determination
for
pfizer
litigation.
first,
their
agreements
between
bristol
on
the
one
hand
and
squibb
and
upjohn
on
the
other
under
which
squibb
and
upjohn
gave
bristol
the
authority
to
settle
and
handle
the
pfizer
litigation.
mr.
friedman
no,
it
does
not.
indeed,
by
implication
the
court
presumably
thought
that
the
evidence
was
sufficient
because
it
sent
it
back
for
a
new
trial,
and
if
it
felt
that
the
evidence
was
insufficient,
but
i
think
these
facts
on
bringing
out
a
meaningful
and
helpful
in
terms
of
some
of
the
objections
they
raised
to
the
charge.
so
--
and
in
the
course
of
this
licensing,
this,
i
am
sorry,
from
the
course
of
this
agreement
under
which
bristol
is
authorized
to
handle
the
pfizer
and
squibb
interests
in
settling,
negotiating,
and
conducting
the
litigations
against
pfizer.
there
was
a
statement
in
there
that
any
license
that
bristol
obtained
for
squibb
and
upjohn
during
the
course
of
the
litigation,
during
the
course
of
the
settlement,
might
be
limited,
however,
to
giving
squibb
and
upjohn
the
right,
the
right
to
sell
and
use,
but
not
to
manufacture.
so
in
addition
to
which
squibb
and
upjohn
were
bound,
were
bound
under
this
agreement
for
the
duration
of
the
litigation
with
pfizer,
the
patent
litigation
and
three
years
thereafter
to
purchase
all
their
requirements
of
tetracycline
from
bristol.
so
at
this
point
bristol
had
the
thing
locked
up
in
the
sense
that
it
had
control
of
the
litigation.
it
was
protected
that
squibb
and
upjohn
couldn’t
settle
themselves
with
pfizer
and
perhaps
purchasing
both
from
pfizer
and
therefore
loosing
a
customer
and
at
the
same
time
it
had
put
in
there
a
provision
that
would
protect
it
from
having
to
give
its
two
major
customers,
squibb
and
upjohn,
the
right
to
manufacture
and
thus
oust
this
important
sort
of
business.
now,
ultimately
the
litigation
was
settled
and
the
settlement
was
precipitated
by
the
fact
that
there
was,
brought
out
shortly
before
the
settlement,
the
fact
that
a
detective
who
was
paid
by
the
general
counsel
of
pfizer
had
undertaken
to
tap
the
telephones
of
bristol
and
squibb.
and
when
this
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
pfizer,
pfizer
immediately
said
let's
get
together
and
settle
it,
and
they
settled
it
and
they
settled
it
as
i
have
indicated
that
a
license
was
given
to
squibb
and
upjohn
to
make
use
in
sales
of
the
drug
trade
and
a
license
was
given
to
bristol
to
manufacture
using
itself.
now,
during
the
period,
thereafter,
from
--
i
mean,
for
the
whole
period
to
the
end
of
the
conspiracy,
no
one
else
was
licensed
other
than
these
five
people.
no
one
sold
in
bulk
other
than
bristol
and
during
the
same
period
there
were
ten
requests
made
for
licenses
or
for
both
sales
of
tetracycline
and
they
were
rejected.
now,
let
me
just
very
briefly
refer
one
or
two
of
the
grounds
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
this
charge
was
insufficient.
let
me
take
the
major
argument
that
the
respondents
make
here.
parke-davis
was
not
a
conspirator.
parke-davis
during
the
period
of
the
conspiracy
did
many
of
the
things
that
the
government
said
when
done
by
the
three
respondents
as
part
of
the
conspiracy,
they
followed
the
same
prices,
they
did
not
grant
licenses
to
start
with.
and
the
theory
of
the
respondents
in
this
case,
one
of
their
principle
defenses
was
that
parke-davis
is
doing
the
same
things,
admittedly
not
pursuant
to
a
conspiracy
as
these
conspirators
had
done
with
strong
evidence
that
in
fact
this
identical
conduct
was
a
result
of
independent
business
judgment,
but
not
and
not
agreement
of
concerted
action.
the
government
of
course
pointed
to
the
fact
that
parke-davis
in
many
respects
had
not
done
the
same
thing.
parke-davis
for
one
thing
was
not
in
tetracycline.
secondly,
parke-davis
gave
no
licenses.
parke-davis
was
not
involved
in
any
of
the
patent
litigations
and
the
various
negotiations.
the
district
court
charged
the
jury
at
length
about
this
issue.
it
pointed
out
that
they
had
heard
a
lot
of
evidence
with
respect
to
parke-davis.
that
parke-davis
in
some
respect
was
similar
that
in
other
respect,
it
was
dissimilar.
it
pointed
out
that
parke-davis
was
not
indicted
and
it
urged
the
jury,
told
the
jury,
this
is
one
of
the
factors
they
have
to
take
into
consideration.
the
judge
refused
an
instruction
which
the
respondents
tended
and
which
the
respondents
wanted
them
to
line
up
the
dissimilarities,
i
am
sorry
the
similarities
between
parke-davis’
conduct
and
that
of
the
respondents.
the
judge
refused
to
do
that.
he
said
“that
would
be
quite
correct
and
we
think
that
would
be
an
unfair
charge,
that
would
be
a
loaded
charge”
because
if
they
have
to
charge
on
the
similarities
i
should
also
charge
on
the
dissimilarities.
they
also
objected
because
they
--
and
the
court
of
appeals
criticized
the
cause
of
the
district
court
for
not
permitting
an
instruction
on
the
presumption
of
innocence.
they
wanted
the
judge
to
instruct
on
a
presumption
of
innocence,
that
parke-davis
not
a
defendant
was
presumed
innocent.
the
judge
said
that
presumption
of
innocence
relates
to
the
defendants
and
there
was
no
occasion
to
instruct
on
the
presumption
of
other
persons
that
parke-davis
was
not
indicted
and
that
is
as
far
as
no
need
for
the
jury
to
speculate
it
on
why
they
had
not
been
indicted.
and
had
the
judge
given
the
instructions
that
the
respondents
submitted,
this
could
have
engendered
a
further
problem
of
confusion
because
the
jury
might
then,
despite
other
instructions
have
drawn
some
interest,
drawn
some
inference,
that
the
fact
that
the
respondents
were
indicted
was
itself
of
significance.
i’d
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
friedman
one
minute,
well,
i’ll
try
to
be
very
rapid.
first,
mr.
justice
brennan,
the
arguments
for
the
jury
is
set
forth
at
length
at
page
4719
to
4913.
mr.
friedman
4719
to
4913.
secondly,
i’d
like
to
refer
the
court
to
pages
60
to
65
of
our
brief
in
which
we
argue
that
parke-davis
and
the
other
defendants
were
not
inhibited
from
making
to
the
jury
the
arguments
on
parke-davis,
that
we
argue
this
was
basically
a
judgment
strategy
judgment
made
by
themselves
and
finally,
i
just
like
to
say
that
we
disagree.
we
disagree
with
mr.
wood’s
arguments
that
somehow
this
charge
denigrated
the
evidence
that
was
favorable
to
the
defendants
and
stressed
the
inflammatory
and
prejudicial
thing.
we
think
this
is
a
fair
charge
and
all
i
can
urge
upon
the
court
is
that
when
it
reads
the
charge,
when
it
reads
charge,
it
seems
to
me
as
completely
objective.
they’ve
discussed
all
of
these
evidence.
they've
recognized
the
problems
on
the
costs
which
mr.
wood
is
referred.
the
court
specifically
pointed
out
to
the
jury
that
the
cost
figures,
the
difference
between
factory
cost
and
selling
price
did
not
take
account
of
many
other
items
of
course
and
that
was
extensively
brought
out
in
the
examination
for
witness
and
the
court
charged
the
jury,
that
those
were
factors
to
be
taken
into
account.
thank
you.
