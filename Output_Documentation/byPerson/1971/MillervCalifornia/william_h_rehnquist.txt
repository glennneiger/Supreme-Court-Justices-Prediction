justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
mark,
following
the
conviction
you
appealed
from
the
appellate
departments
affirmance
to
the
court
of
appeal
for
discretionary
review,
is
that
right?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
does
not
the
court
of
appeal
also
have
a
right
without
certification
to
grant
you
a
discretionary
hearing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
do
you
have
no
right
after
the
conviction,
the
petition
of
supreme
court
of
california
for
discretionary
review?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
the
east
los
angles
proceeding
was
a
jury
actually
handling
that
case
without
a
dismissal
on
a
preliminary
motion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
capizzi,
if,
in
fact,
the
court
were
to
adapt
a
local
or
community
standard
as
opposed
to
a
federal
standard,
wouldn't
it
be
guarantee
of
jury
trial
in
each
case,
be
itself
some
way
of
evidencing
the
jury's
reaction,
be
some
evidence
of
the
local
communities
standard
without
the
necessity
of
expert
testimony?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
marks,
how
could
that
be
res
judicata
under
california
law
if
the
same
people
weren’t
parties
to
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
was
the
same
defendant?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you’re
not
talking
at
about
precisely
the
same
film,
an
absolute
duplicate.
you’re
talking
just
about
similarities?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
films,
i
presume,
at
least
sold
under
different
titles
are
produced
by
different
producers?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
marks,
under
your
theory,
would
it
be
permissible
for
the
state
to
deal
with
a
particular
book
or
a
particular
movie
in
an
in
rem
proceeding
and
given
a
favorable
result
to
them
on
the
obscenity
issue
bind
anyone
from
thereafter
who
used
it
in
the
state
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
that
was
obscene?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
even
though
the
new
defendant
was
not
a
party
to
that
proceeding,
he
can’t
defend
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
not
obscene.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
the
kind
of
in
rem
proceeding,
you
kind
of
like
binds
the
state
but
not
the
defendant?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you’re
