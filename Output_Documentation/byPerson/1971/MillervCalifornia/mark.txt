mr.
mark
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
court
please,
to
continue
with
my
preface,
if
you
will
to
the
argument,
yesterday
i
was
expressing
the
proposition
that
perhaps
the
court
has
not
become
acquainted
with
the
realities
of
the
situation
which
lawyers
and
perhaps
judges
are
faced
with
when
approaching
an
obscenity
case
when
it
is
put
into
the
criminal
context.
for
instance
the
fifth
circuit
in
a
case
of
us
vs
groner
decided
january
11,
1972
mr.
justice
thornberry
expressed
some
apprehension
that
he
could
not
understand
what
was
happening
in
the
obscenity
field
and
certainly
could
not
make
any
determinations
for
himself
as
to
what
was
obscene
or
not
obscene
in
the
absence
of
expert
testimony
and
also
express
that
we
thought
in
line
with
several
other
cases
that
a
national
standard
as
far
as
contemporary
standards
would
seem
to
be
just
the
ticket
under
the
circumstances
of
that
material
goes
between
states.
the
case
at
bar
is
very
interesting
i
think
when
you
examine
the
history
of
this
case
mr.
miller
and
it
illustrates
in
my
opinion
why
harris
v.
younger
was
decided
wrongly.
mr.
miller
has
a
company
which
publishes
and
it's
in
covina,
which
is
in
the
county
of
los
angeles.
they
send
mailers
out,
brochures
out.
brochures
went
to
los
angeles
county,
orange
county,
san
diego
county,
and
to
the
various
states.
you
must
understand
that
within
the
various
counties
there
are
district
attorneys
and
city
attorneys
who
are
responsible
for
bringing
prosecutions
and
it's
up
to
their
discretion
as
to
whether
or
not
a
prosecution
will
be
had.
that
is
a
complaint
filed.
now,
in
mr.
millers
case
there
were
prosecutions
filed
in
perhaps
15
different
municipal
courts
on
the
same
brochures
within
the
county
of
los
angeles
in
different
municipal
courts,
different
district
attorneys,
deputies
of
the
same
county,
prosecution
in
orange
county,
prosecutions
in
san
diego
county,
and
this
is
what
happened
in
orange
county.
first
of
all,
in
los
angeles
county
we
brought
a
motion
and
that
is
just
illustrated
in
the
clerk's
transcript
before
judge
arguelles
in
east
los
angeles
judicial
district
and
the
motion
was
presented
in
which
we
had
expert
witnesses
testifying
that
the
material
was
not
obscene,
and
was
constitutionally
protected
and
judge
arguelles
made
a
determination
dismissing
the
action
that
the
material
wasn't
that
protected
as
set
forth
--
for
the
reason
set
forth
in
the
various
cases.
after
that,
the
orange
county
prosecution
was
started,
same
brochures,
same
defendant,
same
plaintiffs
to
--
with
the
people
of
the
state
of
california.
so
what
did
we
do
in
orange
county?
we
went
to
the
first
trial
judge
and
we
made
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
constitutionally
protected,
presented
expert
witnesses.
the
people
presented
none,
the
judge
denied
the
motion.
we
then
took
a
petition
to
writ
of
prohibition
to
the
superior
court
in
orange
county
to
stay
the
proceedings,
writ
of
prohibition
denied
out
of
hand,
appealed
to
the
orange
county
to
the
court
of
appeals,
second
appellate
district
for
a
stay,
a
writ
of
supersedeas.
denied,
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
california
denied,
no
stay.
we
then
went
habeas
corpus
route
through
the
courts
alleging
that
the
material
was
protected.
we
went
to
the
superior
court,
the
court
of
appeals,
supreme
court,
all
denied
out
of
hand.
also
alleging
if
you
please
in
the
habeas
corpus
proceedings
that
there
was
a
res
judicata,
as
estoppel,
ashe
versus
swenson,
waller
versus
florida
decided
by
this
court.
the
material
is
protected,
it
can't
be
prosecuted,
denied,
out
of
hand.
no
court
to
date
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
you
now
consider
the
fact
and
i
think
i
misspoke
myself,
that
i
said
a
seven
week
trial,
it
was
not,
it
was
a
seven
day
trial.
but
this
is
not,
this
is
a
very
short
trial
for
obscenity
cases
as
a
rule.
after
all
of
these
pre-trial
proceedings
in
which
we
were
trying
to
get
nothing
but
an
adversary
hearing,
we
then
went
to
trial
with
a
jury,
a
conviction,
an
affirmance
without
an
opinion
in
which
the
appellate
court
completely
abdicated
its
own
responsibility,
and
that
is
to
review
the
material,
a
simple,
affirmance
and
remanded
it
and
finally
an
appeal
to
this
court.
mr.
mark
i
asked
what
is
called
a
petition
for
certification
and
this
is
discretionary
with
the
appellate
department
of
the
superior
court,
whether
or
not
they
want
to
certify
the
important
question
over
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
mark
that
is
correct,
they
can.
if
the
opinion
is
published,
if
there
is
a
published
opinion
in
the
appellate
department
which
is
entirely
discretionary
with
them,
then
the
court
of
appeal
has
the
right
to
exercise
its
discretion
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
wants
to
decide
that
question
and
take
jurisdiction.
mr.
mark
no.
absolutely,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
is
expressly
prohibited
that
you
do
make
such
an
application.
i
believe
there
was
a
case
that
came
out
that
said,
once
your
petition
for
certification
is
denied
in
the
appellate
department,
you
have
no
right
to
appeal
that
or
that
it
is
purely
discretionary
under
the
court
rules.
mr.
mark
the
only
opinion
that
is
in
any
court
in
the
california
court
with
respect
to
the
material
in
this
case
is
found
in
the
clerk's
transcript
at
page
17,
that
is
judge
arguelles
memorandum
opinion
and
order
and
this
is
the
case
out
of
the
municipal
court
of
the
east
los
angeles
judicial
district,
it
is
not
in
the
appendix,
it
is
in
the
clerk's
transcript
and
this
was
the
basis
of
the
res
judicate
claim
that
we
have.
mr.
mark
60
days
county
jail
on
this
particular
chart
and
$1000
fine
as
i
recall,
which
has
been
stayed.
to
continue,
taking
this
history
of
the
case
procedurally,
i
have
the
following
quote
which
i
picked
up
from
a
recent
case
and
that
is
i
entertain
more
than
a
mild
suspicion
however
that
this
is
an
exercise
in
futility
that
the
court
is
merely
marching
up
the
hill
only
to
march
right
down
again
and
it
is
timely
become
just
a
little
realistic
in
the
face
of
a
record
such
as
this
one,
us
vs
tucker
decided
january
12,
this
year.
mr.
justice
burger
said
that
in
a
different
context.
mr.
mark
i
think
that
in
taking
the
history
of
this
case
if
you
please,
it
illustrates
the
futility
of
making
a
decision
by
this
court
in
the
ordinary
manner
as
to
whether
or
not
for
instance
contemporary
standards
are
national
or
local
because
it
really
does
not
matter,
the
judges
below
simply
will
not
pay
any
attention
to
the
cases.
they
do
not
rule
as
a
matter
of
law
and
obscenity
cases.
it
is
a
very
visceral
reaction.
you
get
a
shock
value
on
obscenity
in
no
other
cases.
they,
in
my
experience
do
not
function
and
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
answer
to
the
dilemma
which
is
posed
that
the
paradise,
that
your
reconcilable
conflict
between
the
cases
is
that
this
court
set
up
a
series
of
rules
by
which
courts
must
act
in
obscenity
cases
and
that
is
that
they
must
for
instance
prior
to
initiating
a
criminal
proceeding
have
the
type
of
hearing
on
the
material
which
is
set
for
it
in
freedman
versus
maryland,
blount
versus
rizzi
and
there
should
be
rules
whereby
they
are
compelled
to
either
state
that
it
is
protected
or
not
protected,
so
that
somewhere
along
the
line
before
the
criminal
process
starts,
the
person
who
is
going
to
be
involved
in
a
criminal
prosecution
will
at
least
have
the
vaguest
idea
that
what
he
is
trying
to
purvey
or
so
is
not
or
is
within
the
marketplace
and
i
give
you
the
following
example
and
i
say
this
is
why
i
believe
it
comes
within
the
context
of
the
certiorari
questions
because
we
have
here
the
question
national
standards
or
state
standards.
if
we
do
not
have
national
standards,
i
think
our
brief
pointed
out
that
in
the
area
of
film,
in
the
area
of
books
which
cross
straight
lines,
there
must
be
a
common
standard
because
otherwise
state
a
can
impose
unreasonable
burdens
upon
what
kinds
of
films
are
shown
in
the
motion
picture
theaters
in
their
neighborhood,
perhaps
one
community,
local
community
or
state
does
not
like
r
films,
because
r-rated
films
have
sex
portrayed
in
them.
some
x-films
sometimes
have
more
violence
than
an
r
film
and
less
sex.
it
depends
upon
the
individual
idea
of
the
censor
himself.
mr.
mark
i
am
suggesting
a
process
whereby
if
there
is
cause
to
believe,
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
material
which
is
being
sent
out
or
is
being
sold
on
the
stand
is
or
maybe
violative
of
the
penal
statute
or
maybe
obscene
within
the
area
of
the
state
statute
that
the
judge
issues
a
show
cause
order
and
perhaps
even
a
seizure
warrant.
the
material
has
seized,
it
is
brought
into
court,
one
day
hearing,
expert
testimony,
two
days
to
make
a
decision.
the
decision
should
be
in
writing
stating
the
judge's
reasons
for
believing
that
the
material
is
or
is
not
protected.
at
that
point,
you
have
some
sort
of
adjudication
because
the
real
proposition
and
problem
is
with
scienter,
mr.
miller
and
every
other
seller
of
pornography
has
a
justice
in
this
case.
a
judge
which
says
the
material
is
protected
in
one
jurisdiction
to
no
avail
in
another,
because
he
can
not
get
any
recourse.
if
he
goes
to
a
jury
trial
and
gets
acquitted,
the
judge
in
the
next
jurisdiction
says,
well,
i
do
not
know
what
the
acquittal
was
based
on,
maybe
it
was
just
as
the
jury
was
not
satisfied
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
he
was
the
person
who
sold
it.
maybe
they
were
not
satisfied
with
scienter.
the
criminal
process
is
not
equipped
to
deal
with
obscenity
questions.
it
never
has
been
and
never
was.
there
has
to
be
a
different
type
of
process
dealing
in
the
civil
area
to
deal
with
the
sensitive
area
of
suppression
and
censorship.
that
is
why
i
suggest
for
instance
that
the
national
standard
has
to
apply,
but
it
has
to
apply
in
the
area
of
inter-state
commerce,
it
has
to
apply
also.
we
have
a
very
interesting
question,
what
happens
with
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause?
if
one
court
says,
it
is
obscene
in
one
state,
does
not
this
bind
another
court
under
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
or
if
it
is
obscene,
what
happens?
is
the
man
entitled
to
plead
the
other
judgment
in
bar
as
an
estoppel
or
just
as
a
defense
in
the
grounds
that
he
has
no
scienter,
how
could
i
possibly
know
that
it
is
obscene
if
a
court
said
it
is
not
obscene.
mr.
mark
there
was
no
request
to
charge
the
jury
on
the
national
standards.
the
charge
was
made
in
the
terms
of
state
standards
because
at
the
time,
there
was
and
still
is
a
case
of
in
re
giannini,
which
is
cited
in
our
briefs.
in
the
giannini
case,
our
california
supreme
court
said
in
the
matter
of
dancing,
topless
dancing,
they
said,
at
least
the
standards
have
to
be
statewide
because
there
has
to
be
some
sort
of
uniformity,
although
they
felt
that
you
can
not
cross
a
dance
act
between
across
county
borders
then
obviously
the
local
community
should
be
the
best
judge,
but
there
at
least
has
to
be
some
uniformity.
applying
that
rationale
of
the
giannini
case
to
motion
pictures,
books,
those
magazines
that
travel
across
state
lines
and
which
seem
that
the
national
standard
is
the
only
standard
which
has
any
reasonable
grounds.
mr.
mark
it
is
a
complaint
mr.
justice
blackmun,
but
the
--
i
believe
both
were
after
the
amendment.
mr.
mark
well,
no
because
the
acts
were
before
the
amendment.
so
the
question
was
at
one
time,
whether
or
not
you
have
the
definition,
the
original
definition
was
knowing
the
matter
to
be
obscene.
the
second
definition
was
having
knowledge
or
being
aware
of
the
contents
of
the
matter,
which
to
me
is
just
as
vague
a
statement
as
some
of
the
other
definitions
that
we
have
had
regarding
obscenity.
mr.
mark
i
don't
know
because
if
you
read
the
instructions
that
were
given,
one
of
them
says
that
the
person
to
be
convicted,
mr.
miller
had
to
know
that
the
matter
was
obscene
and
know
all
of
the
elements
that
it
went
beyond
contemporary
limits
of
candor
etcetera,
and
tha
set
of
instructions
said
that,
very
confusing,
that
it
only
many
had
to
be
aware
of
the
contents
of
the
matter.
mr.
mark
well,
it
is
a
very
confusing
subject
because
to
some
judges
and
i
suppose
lawyers,
it
means
the
same
thing.
to
me
it
doesn't.
it
means
an
entirely
different
thing,
because
being
aware
of
the
character
of
the
matter,
that's
what
the
new
section
means,
and
what
the
character
of
the
matter
is,
is
a
very,
very
illusive
quality.
does
it
mean
that
the
character
is
that
of
a
sex,
is
it
the
character
of
violence,
is
it
the
character
of
sadism,
sadomasochism,
one
of
the
characteristics
of
pornography,
we
do
not
know.
it
is
--
probably
whatever
the
jury
wants
to
think
it
means.
one
of
the
big
problems
that
comes
up
in
the
prosecution
or
the
trial
of
the
case
and
the
defense
of
a
case
is
this
question
of
the
various
and
i
might
say
paradoxical
rules
that
this
court
is
set
up,
because
in
roth,
court
said
that
briefs,
and
i
am
paraphrasing
a
little
bit,
paraphrasing,
in
roth,
the
court
said
that
obscenity
is
not
speech.
then,
in
stanley
versus
georgia,
the
court
said
that
obscenity
is
speech.
then
in
reidel,
the
court
said
we
adopt
both
rob
and
stanley
and
we
do
not
vary
one
way
or
another.
so
we
come
to
the
unusual
proposition
that
speech
is
not
speech.
i
adhere
perhaps
and
this
is
my
final
argument
to
the
add
on
theory
of
constitutional
protection.
it
appears
that
from
reading
the
various
cases
that
if
you
have
the
first
amendment
protection
and
you
add
on
for
instance
the
ninth
amendment,
the
right
to
privacy
as
in
stanley,
1
and
9
equal
14,
and
you
have
a
constitutional
protection.
in
our
case,
we
have
a
few
other
add
on
protections
that
mr.
miller
should
avail
in
himself.
he
has
the
first
amendment
protection,
he
has
the
fifth
amendment,
which
is
the
res
judicata
or
estoppel,
he
also
has
the
ninth
amendment.
so
in
this
case,
we
have
1,
5,
and
9,
including
14
and
he
should
be
able
to
have
a
reversal
just
on
that
theory
of
law.
getting
back
to
the
more
mundane,
i
say
very
seriously,
we
need
guidance
from
the
court,
this
court,
and
i
think
it
cannot
be
done
in
the
framework
of
deciding
whether
national
or
local
standards
applied
because
the
courts
below
do
not
know
how
to
apply
them
even
if
it
is
shown
to
them
what
it
means.
they
work
on
a
case
by
case
basis
and
i
had
one
judge
said
to
me,
when
i
pointed
out
blount
versus
rizzi,
he
says,
that
only
counts
if
the
defendant's
name
is
rizzi
and
the
plaintiff's
name
is
blount,
and
otherwise
it
is
distinguishable
on
that
fact.
so
set
us
up
some
rules,
give
us
some
guidance,
let's
get
this
type
of
action
out
of
the
criminal
area
unless
there
is
a
distinctive
criminal
case
with
knowledge
and
the
type
of
pre-warning
that
is
generally
accepted
as
a
part
of
due
process.
mr.
mark
yes
sir.
mr.
mark
right,
in
the
east
los
angeles,
municipal
district.
mr.
mark
yes,
there
is
no
other
opinion.
mr.
mark
he
was
prosecuted
in
the
orange
county
municipal
district.
mr.
mark
there
is
none.
mr.
mark
the
record
in
the
orange
county
case,
it
consists
of
the
appendix
which
is
a
jury
verdict
of
conviction
and
an
appellate
order
which
says
the
conviction
is
affirmed.
mr.
mark
you
have
the
brochure
on
which
they
are
related
it.
you
have
the
reporter's
transcript
in
the.
--
mr.
mark
yes.
mr.
mark
the
same
effect.
you
see
in
orange
county,
there
was
a
pretrial
hearing
in
which
we
had
our
experts
testifying
and
the
people
offered
no
evidence.
then,
on
trial,
we
again
offered
the
people,
then
offered
their
experts
who
said
the
matter
is
obscene
or
whatever
other
elements
they
thought
were
present.
our
experts
testified
to
the
contrary
and
it
became
the
battle
of
experts
and
the
jury
looked
at
the
material
and
said,
guilty.
mr.
mark
the
instructions
to
the
jury
are
found
in
the
clerk's
transcript
and
i
believe
a
part
in
the
third
appendix
which
is
the
--.
mr.
mark
i
think
that
roth
should
be
clarified
to
show
what
it
actually
meant
because
it
makes
no
sense
the
way
it
reads
now
in
light
of
subsequent
opinions
because
the
way
the
court
has
ruled
for
instance
in
redrup,
and
there
is
various
qualifying
matters
with
respect
to
roth
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
the
outcomes
right
out
of
37
photographs
and
it
doesn't
mean
what
we
said.
i
think
it
should
be
overruled.
i
think
that
the
first
amendment
should
bar
criminal
prosecutions
in
the
absence
of
direct
knowledge
i
think.
mr.
mark
in
the
absence
of
direct
knowledge,
a
prior
knowing
hearing
that
the
matter
is
probably
within
the
context
or
framework
of
the
prohibited
speech.
mr.
mark
no,
i
am
just
saying
that
this
seems
to
be
after
going
through
the
various
cases
in
the
paradoxes
that
are
arisen
in
the
decision
by
the
fifth
circuit
as
late
as
january
12,
that
there
is
no
other
answer
because
you
can't
resolve
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
various
justices
and
the
only
resolution
is
to
take
everything
and
say,
okay,
that
is
that
way
it
is.
speech
is
not
speech
if
it
is
obscenity
and
then
set
up
a
set
of
rules
so
that
the
judges
will
know
exactly
what
to
do
when
they
get
with
an
obscenity
case.
i
would
say
bar
the
criminal
prosecution,
take
it
out
of
the
criminal
area
until
you
have
a
prior
hearing
as
to
the
obscenity
or
non-obscenity
of
it.
thank
you
justice.
mr.
mark
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
court
please,
to
continue
with
my
preface,
if
you
will
to
the
argument,
yesterday
i
was
expressing
the
proposition
that
perhaps
the
court
has
not
become
acquainted
with
the
realities
of
the
situation
which
lawyers
and
perhaps
judges
are
faced
with
when
approaching
an
obscenity
case
when
it
is
put
into
the
criminal
context.
for
instance
the
fifth
circuit
in
a
case
of
us
vs
groner
decided
january
11,
1972
mr.
justice
thornberry
expressed
some
apprehension
that
he
could
not
understand
what
was
happening
in
the
obscenity
field
and
certainly
could
not
make
any
determinations
for
himself
as
to
what
was
obscene
or
not
obscene
in
the
absence
of
expert
testimony
and
also
express
that
we
thought
in
line
with
several
other
cases
that
a
national
standard
as
far
as
contemporary
standards
would
seem
to
be
just
the
ticket
under
the
circumstances
of
that
material
goes
between
states.
the
case
at
bar
is
very
interesting
i
think
when
you
examine
the
history
of
this
case
mr.
miller
and
it
illustrates
in
my
opinion
why
harris
v.
younger
was
decided
wrongly.
mr.
miller
has
a
company
which
publishes
and
it's
in
covina,
which
is
in
the
county
of
los
angeles.
they
send
mailers
out,
brochures
out.
brochures
went
to
los
angeles
county,
orange
county,
san
diego
county,
and
to
the
various
states.
you
must
understand
that
within
the
various
counties
there
are
district
attorneys
and
city
attorneys
who
are
responsible
for
bringing
prosecutions
and
it's
up
to
their
discretion
as
to
whether
or
not
a
prosecution
will
be
had.
that
is
a
complaint
filed.
now,
in
mr.
millers
case
there
were
prosecutions
filed
in
perhaps
15
different
municipal
courts
on
the
same
brochures
within
the
county
of
los
angeles
in
different
municipal
courts,
different
district
attorneys,
deputies
of
the
same
county,
prosecution
in
orange
county,
prosecutions
in
san
diego
county,
and
this
is
what
happened
in
orange
county.
first
of
all,
in
los
angeles
county
we
brought
a
motion
and
that
is
just
illustrated
in
the
clerk's
transcript
before
judge
arguelles
in
east
los
angeles
judicial
district
and
the
motion
was
presented
in
which
we
had
expert
witnesses
testifying
that
the
material
was
not
obscene,
and
was
constitutionally
protected
and
judge
arguelles
made
a
determination
dismissing
the
action
that
the
material
wasn't
that
protected
as
set
forth
--
for
the
reason
set
forth
in
the
various
cases.
after
that,
the
orange
county
prosecution
was
started,
same
brochures,
same
defendant,
same
plaintiffs
to
--
with
the
people
of
the
state
of
california.
so
what
did
we
do
in
orange
county?
we
went
to
the
first
trial
judge
and
we
made
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
constitutionally
protected,
presented
expert
witnesses.
the
people
presented
none,
the
judge
denied
the
motion.
we
then
took
a
petition
to
writ
of
prohibition
to
the
superior
court
in
orange
county
to
stay
the
proceedings,
writ
of
prohibition
denied
out
of
hand,
appealed
to
the
orange
county
to
the
court
of
appeals,
second
appellate
district
for
a
stay,
a
writ
of
supersedeas.
denied,
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
california
denied,
no
stay.
we
then
went
habeas
corpus
route
through
the
courts
alleging
that
the
material
was
protected.
we
went
to
the
superior
court,
the
court
of
appeals,
supreme
court,
all
denied
out
of
hand.
also
alleging
if
you
please
in
the
habeas
corpus
proceedings
that
there
was
a
res
judicata,
as
estoppel,
ashe
versus
swenson,
waller
versus
florida
decided
by
this
court.
the
material
is
protected,
it
can't
be
prosecuted,
denied,
out
of
hand.
no
court
to
date
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
you
now
consider
the
fact
and
i
think
i
misspoke
myself,
that
i
said
a
seven
week
trial,
it
was
not,
it
was
a
seven
day
trial.
but
this
is
not,
this
is
a
very
short
trial
for
obscenity
cases
as
a
rule.
after
all
of
these
pre-trial
proceedings
in
which
we
were
trying
to
get
nothing
but
an
adversary
hearing,
we
then
went
to
trial
with
a
jury,
a
conviction,
an
affirmance
without
an
opinion
in
which
the
appellate
court
completely
abdicated
its
own
responsibility,
and
that
is
to
review
the
material,
a
simple,
affirmance
and
remanded
it
and
finally
an
appeal
to
this
court.
mr.
mark
i
asked
what
is
called
a
petition
for
certification
and
this
is
discretionary
with
the
appellate
department
of
the
superior
court,
whether
or
not
they
want
to
certify
the
important
question
over
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
mark
that
is
correct,
they
can.
if
the
opinion
is
published,
if
there
is
a
published
opinion
in
the
appellate
department
which
is
entirely
discretionary
with
them,
then
the
court
of
appeal
has
the
right
to
exercise
its
discretion
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
wants
to
decide
that
question
and
take
jurisdiction.
mr.
mark
no.
absolutely,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
is
expressly
prohibited
that
you
do
make
such
an
application.
i
believe
there
was
a
case
that
came
out
that
said,
once
your
petition
for
certification
is
denied
in
the
appellate
department,
you
have
no
right
to
appeal
that
or
that
it
is
purely
discretionary
under
the
court
rules.
mr.
mark
the
only
opinion
that
is
in
any
court
in
the
california
court
with
respect
to
the
material
in
this
case
is
found
in
the
clerk's
transcript
at
page
17,
that
is
judge
arguelles
memorandum
opinion
and
order
and
this
is
the
case
out
of
the
municipal
court
of
the
east
los
angeles
judicial
district,
it
is
not
in
the
appendix,
it
is
in
the
clerk's
transcript
and
this
was
the
basis
of
the
res
judicate
claim
that
we
have.
mr.
mark
60
days
county
jail
on
this
particular
chart
and
$1000
fine
as
i
recall,
which
has
been
stayed.
to
continue,
taking
this
history
of
the
case
procedurally,
i
have
the
following
quote
which
i
picked
up
from
a
recent
case
and
that
is
i
entertain
more
than
a
mild
suspicion
however
that
this
is
an
exercise
in
futility
that
the
court
is
merely
marching
up
the
hill
only
to
march
right
down
again
and
it
is
timely
become
just
a
little
realistic
in
the
face
of
a
record
such
as
this
one,
us
vs
tucker
decided
january
12,
this
year.
mr.
justice
burger
said
that
in
a
different
context.
mr.
mark
i
think
that
in
taking
the
history
of
this
case
if
you
please,
it
illustrates
the
futility
of
making
a
decision
by
this
court
in
the
ordinary
manner
as
to
whether
or
not
for
instance
contemporary
standards
are
national
or
local
because
it
really
does
not
matter,
the
judges
below
simply
will
not
pay
any
attention
to
the
cases.
they
do
not
rule
as
a
matter
of
law
and
obscenity
cases.
it
is
a
very
visceral
reaction.
you
get
a
shock
value
on
obscenity
in
no
other
cases.
they,
in
my
experience
do
not
function
and
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
answer
to
the
dilemma
which
is
posed
that
the
paradise,
that
your
reconcilable
conflict
between
the
cases
is
that
this
court
set
up
a
series
of
rules
by
which
courts
must
act
in
obscenity
cases
and
that
is
that
they
must
for
instance
prior
to
initiating
a
criminal
proceeding
have
the
type
of
hearing
on
the
material
which
is
set
for
it
in
freedman
versus
maryland,
blount
versus
rizzi
and
there
should
be
rules
whereby
they
are
compelled
to
either
state
that
it
is
protected
or
not
protected,
so
that
somewhere
along
the
line
before
the
criminal
process
starts,
the
person
who
is
going
to
be
involved
in
a
criminal
prosecution
will
at
least
have
the
vaguest
idea
that
what
he
is
trying
to
purvey
or
so
is
not
or
is
within
the
marketplace
and
i
give
you
the
following
example
and
i
say
this
is
why
i
believe
it
comes
within
the
context
of
the
certiorari
questions
because
we
have
here
the
question
national
standards
or
state
standards.
if
we
do
not
have
national
standards,
i
think
our
brief
pointed
out
that
in
the
area
of
film,
in
the
area
of
books
which
cross
straight
lines,
there
must
be
a
common
standard
because
otherwise
state
a
can
impose
unreasonable
burdens
upon
what
kinds
of
films
are
shown
in
the
motion
picture
theaters
in
their
neighborhood,
perhaps
one
community,
local
community
or
state
does
not
like
r
films,
because
r-rated
films
have
sex
portrayed
in
them.
some
x-films
sometimes
have
more
violence
than
an
r
film
and
less
sex.
it
depends
upon
the
individual
idea
of
the
censor
himself.
mr.
mark
i
am
suggesting
a
process
whereby
if
there
is
cause
to
believe,
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
material
which
is
being
sent
out
or
is
being
sold
on
the
stand
is
or
maybe
violative
of
the
penal
statute
or
maybe
obscene
within
the
area
of
the
state
statute
that
the
judge
issues
a
show
cause
order
and
perhaps
even
a
seizure
warrant.
the
material
has
seized,
it
is
brought
into
court,
one
day
hearing,
expert
testimony,
two
days
to
make
a
decision.
the
decision
should
be
in
writing
stating
the
judge's
reasons
for
believing
that
the
material
is
or
is
not
protected.
at
that
point,
you
have
some
sort
of
adjudication
because
the
real
proposition
and
problem
is
with
scienter,
mr.
miller
and
every
other
seller
of
pornography
has
a
justice
in
this
case.
a
judge
which
says
the
material
is
protected
in
one
jurisdiction
to
no
avail
in
another,
because
he
can
not
get
any
recourse.
if
he
goes
to
a
jury
trial
and
gets
acquitted,
the
judge
in
the
next
jurisdiction
says,
well,
i
do
not
know
what
the
acquittal
was
based
on,
maybe
it
was
just
as
the
jury
was
not
satisfied
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
he
was
the
person
who
sold
it.
maybe
they
were
not
satisfied
with
scienter.
the
criminal
process
is
not
equipped
to
deal
with
obscenity
questions.
it
never
has
been
and
never
was.
there
has
to
be
a
different
type
of
process
dealing
in
the
civil
area
to
deal
with
the
sensitive
area
of
suppression
and
censorship.
that
is
why
i
suggest
for
instance
that
the
national
standard
has
to
apply,
but
it
has
to
apply
in
the
area
of
inter-state
commerce,
it
has
to
apply
also.
we
have
a
very
interesting
question,
what
happens
with
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause?
if
one
court
says,
it
is
obscene
in
one
state,
does
not
this
bind
another
court
under
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
or
if
it
is
obscene,
what
happens?
is
the
man
entitled
to
plead
the
other
judgment
in
bar
as
an
estoppel
or
just
as
a
defense
in
the
grounds
that
he
has
no
scienter,
how
could
i
possibly
know
that
it
is
obscene
if
a
court
said
it
is
not
obscene.
mr.
mark
there
was
no
request
to
charge
the
jury
on
the
national
standards.
the
charge
was
made
in
the
terms
of
state
standards
because
at
the
time,
there
was
and
still
is
a
case
of
in
re
giannini,
which
is
cited
in
our
briefs.
in
the
giannini
case,
our
california
supreme
court
said
in
the
matter
of
dancing,
topless
dancing,
they
said,
at
least
the
standards
have
to
be
statewide
because
there
has
to
be
some
sort
of
uniformity,
although
they
felt
that
you
can
not
cross
a
dance
act
between
across
county
borders
then
obviously
the
local
community
should
be
the
best
judge,
but
there
at
least
has
to
be
some
uniformity.
applying
that
rationale
of
the
giannini
case
to
motion
pictures,
books,
those
magazines
that
travel
across
state
lines
and
which
seem
that
the
national
standard
is
the
only
standard
which
has
any
reasonable
grounds.
mr.
mark
it
is
a
complaint
mr.
justice
blackmun,
but
the
--
i
believe
both
were
after
the
amendment.
mr.
mark
well,
no
because
the
acts
were
before
the
amendment.
so
the
question
was
at
one
time,
whether
or
not
you
have
the
definition,
the
original
definition
was
knowing
the
matter
to
be
obscene.
the
second
definition
was
having
knowledge
or
being
aware
of
the
contents
of
the
matter,
which
to
me
is
just
as
vague
a
statement
as
some
of
the
other
definitions
that
we
have
had
regarding
obscenity.
mr.
mark
i
don't
know
because
if
you
read
the
instructions
that
were
given,
one
of
them
says
that
the
person
to
be
convicted,
mr.
miller
had
to
know
that
the
matter
was
obscene
and
know
all
of
the
elements
that
it
went
beyond
contemporary
limits
of
candor
etcetera,
and
tha
set
of
instructions
said
that,
very
confusing,
that
it
only
many
had
to
be
aware
of
the
contents
of
the
matter.
mr.
mark
well,
it
is
a
very
confusing
subject
because
to
some
judges
and
i
suppose
lawyers,
it
means
the
same
thing.
to
me
it
doesn't.
it
means
an
entirely
different
thing,
because
being
aware
of
the
character
of
the
matter,
that's
what
the
new
section
means,
and
what
the
character
of
the
matter
is,
is
a
very,
very
illusive
quality.
does
it
mean
that
the
character
is
that
of
a
sex,
is
it
the
character
of
violence,
is
it
the
character
of
sadism,
sadomasochism,
one
of
the
characteristics
of
pornography,
we
do
not
know.
it
is
--
probably
whatever
the
jury
wants
to
think
it
means.
one
of
the
big
problems
that
comes
up
in
the
prosecution
or
the
trial
of
the
case
and
the
defense
of
a
case
is
this
question
of
the
various
and
i
might
say
paradoxical
rules
that
this
court
is
set
up,
because
in
roth,
court
said
that
briefs,
and
i
am
paraphrasing
a
little
bit,
paraphrasing,
in
roth,
the
court
said
that
obscenity
is
not
speech.
then,
in
stanley
versus
georgia,
the
court
said
that
obscenity
is
speech.
then
in
reidel,
the
court
said
we
adopt
both
rob
and
stanley
and
we
do
not
vary
one
way
or
another.
so
we
come
to
the
unusual
proposition
that
speech
is
not
speech.
i
adhere
perhaps
and
this
is
my
final
argument
to
the
add
on
theory
of
constitutional
protection.
it
appears
that
from
reading
the
various
cases
that
if
you
have
the
first
amendment
protection
and
you
add
on
for
instance
the
ninth
amendment,
the
right
to
privacy
as
in
stanley,
1
and
9
equal
14,
and
you
have
a
constitutional
protection.
in
our
case,
we
have
a
few
other
add
on
protections
that
mr.
miller
should
avail
in
himself.
he
has
the
first
amendment
protection,
he
has
the
fifth
amendment,
which
is
the
res
judicata
or
estoppel,
he
also
has
the
ninth
amendment.
so
in
this
case,
we
have
1,
5,
and
9,
including
14
and
he
should
be
able
to
have
a
reversal
just
on
that
theory
of
law.
getting
back
to
the
more
mundane,
i
say
very
seriously,
we
need
guidance
from
the
court,
this
court,
and
i
think
it
cannot
be
done
in
the
framework
of
deciding
whether
national
or
local
standards
applied
because
the
courts
below
do
not
know
how
to
apply
them
even
if
it
is
shown
to
them
what
it
means.
they
work
on
a
case
by
case
basis
and
i
had
one
judge
said
to
me,
when
i
pointed
out
blount
versus
rizzi,
he
says,
that
only
counts
if
the
defendant's
name
is
rizzi
and
the
plaintiff's
name
is
blount,
and
otherwise
it
is
distinguishable
on
that
fact.
so
set
us
up
some
rules,
give
us
some
guidance,
let's
get
this
type
of
action
out
of
the
criminal
area
unless
there
is
a
distinctive
criminal
case
with
knowledge
and
the
type
of
pre-warning
that
is
generally
accepted
as
a
part
of
due
process.
mr.
mark
yes
sir.
mr.
mark
right,
in
the
east
los
angeles,
municipal
district.
mr.
mark
yes,
there
is
no
other
opinion.
mr.
mark
he
was
prosecuted
in
the
orange
county
municipal
district.
mr.
mark
there
is
none.
mr.
mark
the
record
in
the
orange
county
case,
it
consists
of
the
appendix
which
is
a
jury
verdict
of
conviction
and
an
appellate
order
which
says
the
conviction
is
affirmed.
mr.
mark
you
have
the
brochure
on
which
they
are
related
it.
you
have
the
reporter's
transcript
in
the.
--
mr.
mark
yes.
mr.
mark
the
same
effect.
you
see
in
orange
county,
there
was
a
pretrial
hearing
in
which
we
had
our
experts
testifying
and
the
people
offered
no
evidence.
then,
on
trial,
we
again
offered
the
people,
then
offered
their
experts
who
said
the
matter
is
obscene
or
whatever
other
elements
they
thought
were
present.
our
experts
testified
to
the
contrary
and
it
became
the
battle
of
experts
and
the
jury
looked
at
the
material
and
said,
guilty.
mr.
mark
the
instructions
to
the
jury
are
found
in
the
clerk's
transcript
and
i
believe
a
part
in
the
third
appendix
which
is
the
--.
mr.
mark
i
think
that
roth
should
be
clarified
to
show
what
it
actually
meant
because
it
makes
no
sense
the
way
it
reads
now
in
light
of
subsequent
opinions
because
the
way
the
court
has
ruled
for
instance
in
redrup,
and
there
is
various
qualifying
matters
with
respect
to
roth
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
the
outcomes
right
out
of
37
photographs
and
it
doesn't
mean
what
we
said.
i
think
it
should
be
overruled.
i
think
that
the
first
amendment
should
bar
criminal
prosecutions
in
the
absence
of
direct
knowledge
i
think.
mr.
mark
in
the
absence
of
direct
knowledge,
a
prior
knowing
hearing
that
the
matter
is
probably
within
the
context
or
framework
of
the
prohibited
speech.
mr.
mark
no,
i
am
just
saying
that
this
seems
to
be
after
going
through
the
various
cases
in
the
paradoxes
that
are
arisen
in
the
decision
by
the
fifth
circuit
as
late
as
january
12,
that
there
is
no
other
answer
because
you
can't
resolve
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
various
justices
and
the
only
resolution
is
to
take
everything
and
say,
okay,
that
is
that
way
it
is.
speech
is
not
speech
if
it
is
obscenity
and
then
set
up
a
set
of
rules
so
that
the
judges
will
know
exactly
what
to
do
when
they
get
with
an
obscenity
case.
i
would
say
bar
the
criminal
prosecution,
take
it
out
of
the
criminal
area
until
you
have
a
prior
hearing
as
to
the
obscenity
or
non-obscenity
of
it.
thank
you
justice.
