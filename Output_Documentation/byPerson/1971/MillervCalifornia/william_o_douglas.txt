justice
william
o.
douglas
you
are
talking
about
redrup
decision?
justice
william
o.
douglas
(inaudible)
any
exhibits
in
this
case?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
i
have
read
the
opinion,
pertaining
to
that
opinion
results
in
the
dismissal
of
the
complaint?
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
that
the
only
opinion
in
this
case?
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
then
what
happened?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
have
heard
to
mr.
marks,
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
it
but
i
gathered
that
his
compliant
is
that
the
issue
that
he
is
pendering
is
akin
to
decision
in
this
court
on
the
vagueness
test
for
constitutionality
of
the
criminal
statute.
do
you
understand
that?
that
what
we
have
done,
what
we
have
set
the
standards
are
to
emphasize,
too
vague
--
as
muster
under
criminal
constitutional
law,
due
process.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
understand
that
too.
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
california
adopted
the
statute
saying
that
it
is
a
crime
to
publish
book
that
has
--
is
without
the
social
values
that
past
muster
by
the
california
supreme
court
decision?
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
california
statute
has
adopted
two
of
the
basis
of
redrup
decision?
justice
william
o.
douglas
to
get
the
experts
who
justifies
the
national
standards.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
suppose
if
that's
true
what
you're
saying,
i
gather
it
is
--
it
would
be
also
very
difficult
for
a
publisher
and
author
to
know
when
he'd
crossed
the
line.
justice
william
o.
douglas
this
was
a
plea
of
guilty
then?
justice
william
o.
douglas
although
your
brief
doesn't
say
so
--
for
these
words,
i
gather
from
your
oral
argument,
do
you
think
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
making
applicable
the
first
amendment
to
the
states
were
long
decided.
justice
william
o.
douglas
if
you
were
to
edict
(inaudible)
and
all
the
others
decisions
should
we
either
overrule
in
that
regard?
justice
william
o.
douglas
of
course,
giannini
as
i
read
that
opinion,
dealt
only
with
the
dance
in
a
local
tavern
in
a
town,
in
california,
right?
justice
william
o.
douglas
we
are
dealing
here
with
the
big
double
dating
company
and
other
big
publishers
of
books
and
tracks.
justice
william
o.
douglas
no,
i
say
but
the
problem
here
that
we're
dealing
with
deals
with
a
big
distribution
system,
which
is
national
and
so
on,
how
does
your
local
standard
depicts
the
normal
pattern
of
american
book
publishing
business
or
magazine
publishing
business.
justice
william
o.
douglas
yeah,
my
question
really
relates
to
whether
or
not
in
this
area
where
we're
not
really
in
the
area
of
a
common
market
of
literature
and
ideas
require
the
national
rather
than
the
local
standard.
justice
william
o.
douglas
maybe
in
california,
they
have
the
privilege
of
doing
what
they
want
was
topless
dancers.
justice
william
o.
douglas
does
that
read
to
giannini
case,
it
wasn't
the
local
standard,
that
the
defense
prosecutor
should
be
the
local
standard.
justice
william
o.
douglas
said
it
the
statement--
justice
william
o.
douglas
in
other
words,
as
matter
of
a
federal
constitutional
law
you
take
the
view
of
justice
burke
in
dissent
in
giannini.
