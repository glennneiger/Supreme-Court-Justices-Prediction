justice

he
doesn’t
--
he
doesn’t
buy
the
book
and
then
take
that
to
the
magistrate?
justice
potter
stewart
is
the
seizure
for
evidence
in
the
prosecution
or
for
destruction
or
both?
justice
potter
stewart
so
if
you
didn’t
have
a
--
if
you
didn’t
have
a
final
judgment
in
that
kind
of
a
proceeding
and
i
suppose
then
it
would
be
res
judicata
that
that
particular
material
was
protected,
wouldn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
understand
smith
against
california
to
stand
for
the
proposition
that
the
seller
must
know
what’s
in
the
book
that
he
sells
or
alternatively
that
the
seller
must
know
that
what
is
in
the
book
he
sells
is
illegal?
justice
potter
stewart
that
goes
a
little
further
than
what
the
opinion
in
the
smith
case
actually
said,
doesn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
the
phrase
that’s
used
in
california
generally
in
jury
instructions
and
in
court
opinions
that
the
measure
is
the
customary
limits
of
candor?
justice
potter
stewart
candor?
justice
potter
stewart
candor
means
honesty.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
test
used
in
other
first
amendment
areas
in
california?
justice
potter
stewart
go
beyond,
beyond
obscene
materials
and
any
other
case
involving
first
amendment
claim
if
it
goes
--
if
it’s
too
honest
is
it
illegal.
justice
potter
stewart
it
seems
to
me
rather
not
proportionate
phrase
to
use.
justice
potter
stewart
the
more
honest
it
is,
the
more
unlawful
it
is.
well,
if
that’s
what
--
i
think
that’s
what
the
word
candor
means.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don’t
know
that
anybody
has
made
a
claim
that
burglary
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
the
one
is
in
the
first
amendment
and
the
other
isn’t.
justice
potter
stewart
nothing
and
nothing
in
the
constitution
that
says
you
have
a
freedom
to
steal
or
commit
burglary
or
murder
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
may
harm,
assault
and
battery.
but
there
is
something
that
says
you
have
the
right
of
free
expression
and
free
speech.
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understand
it
though,
you’re
not
talking
about
giving
us
a
hearing
as
you
did
in
your
words
with
respect
to
the
precise
material
involving
in
a
particular
case
but
just
sort
of
generically
--

is
that
--
justice

stewart
no,
the
same
type
of
material,
not

material.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that’s
where
one
--
justice

stewart
exactly.
justice

he
doesn’t
