unknown
speaker
what
are
the
opinions
in
california
court
enuntiated?
unknown
speaker
mr.
marks
what
was
the
sentence
mr.
miller
received?
i
failed
to
find
it
in
your
brief.
unknown
speaker
well,
was
this
a
jury
trial,
mr.
marks?
unknown
speaker
mr.
marks,
this
perhaps
is
unfair
precisely
on
the
point
that
you’re
arguing
but
you
said
you
waived
juries
in
both
these
recent
trials?
unknown
speaker
what,
as
a
matter
of
trial
tactics
and
defending
cases
like
this,
you
would
ordinarily
prefer
a
bench
trial
to
a
jury
trial?
unknown
speaker
which
then
ends
the
whole
case
--
unknown
speaker
but
i
take
it
that,
it
was
a
determination
of
obscenity
at
this
pre-trial
procedure.
that
is
not
the
conclusive
of
course
at
the
jury
trial,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
you
may
still
argue
with
the
jury
the
non-obscenity
material,
are
you?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
are
misdemeanor
cases
tried
by
it
before
jury?
unknown
speaker
i
gather
mr.
marks,
what
you’re
proposing
is
that
they’ll
be
required
before
there
maybe
a
criminal
prosecution.
some
kind
of
civil
proceeding
at
which
there’s
a
definitive
determination
whether
the
material
involved
is
or
is
not
obscene.
is
that
was
you’re
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
which
would
be
conclusive.
but
what
about
--
how
does
that
apply
in
pandering
situations?
unknown
speaker
mr.
capizzi,
i
gather
your
argument
that
because
of
the
aspect
of
it
must
be
contemporary,
couldn’t
contemporary
have
been.
that
might
be
an
argument
against
a
particular
conclusion
of
non-obscenity
be
binding
on
the
state
where
the
same
material
was
involved
later
but
what
about
the
argument
that
in
any
event
before
there
should
be
any
criminal
prosecution.
there
ought
to
be
a
judicial
determination
of
obscenity
or
no
obscenity
before
that
proceeding
continues.
unknown
speaker
in
effect
for
the
present
time,
if
the
finding
were
in
the
particular
case
involving
the
dissemination
by
a
particular
defendant,
would
it
matter
if
the
determination
whether
that
it
is
not
obscene
applying
a
preponderance
test?
unknown
speaker
well,
except
as
i
understood
mr.
marks
at
least
as
to
some
judges.
they
apply
a
probable
cause
test.
they
don’t
in
fact
make
the
ultimate
determination
of
obscenity
and
non-obscenity
as
i
thought
it
holds.
are
there
some
judges?
unknown
speaker
but
what
would
you
--
if
you
do
have
such
proceeding
at
all,
do
you
think
that
it
should
stop
with
a
probable
cause
determination
or
should
it
go
on
to
make
the
ultimate
determination
obscene?
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course,
i
gather
so
far
at
least,
our
cases
have
indicated
that
you
don’t
approach
this
as
only
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
basis
as
a
constitutional
determination
then
we
have
finally
to
make
a
determination
appear.
that’s
why
we
handle
it
so
far,
haven’t
we?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
think
there’s
a
considerable
evidence.
in
a
negligence
case,
you
determine
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
we
don’t
determine
negligence
out
there.
but
in
obscenity
cases,
we
do.
it’s
a
constitutional
determination,
don’t
we?
unknown
speaker
i
don’t
understand
why
if
you’re
going
to
have
a
civil
proceeding
question
which
is
to
consider
the
obscenity
of
the
material,
for
which
the
defendant
is
being
prosecuted.
why
you
shouldn’t
go
all
the
way
through
and
have
a
judicial
determination
whether
is
or
isn’t
obscene
instead
of
just
a
probable
cause
of
determination?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
said
california
has
something
like
this?
unknown
speaker
well,
it’s
just
that
i
thought
mr.
marks
it’s
not
suggested
that
practice
is
different
at
least
as
it’s
carried
on
by
some
judges
of
california.
unknown
speaker
what
are
the
opinions
