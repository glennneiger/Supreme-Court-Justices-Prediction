mr.
burton
marks
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
purpose
of
my
argument
to
which
eventually
i
hope
will
tie-in
with
the
questions
which
are
raised
on
the
certiorari,
i
am
going
to
make
some
statements
which
may
sound
as
if
they
are
pejorative
or
demeaning,
they
are
not
so
intended.
i
express
them
merely
as
a
statement
of
what
i
have
experienced
in
the
defense
of
obscenity
cases.
my
first
observation
is
that,
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
probably,
no
member
of
this
court
has
gauged
either
the
prosecution
or
the
defense
of
an
obscenity
case
where
you
are
required
to
deal
with
the
various
rules
of
law
and
procedure
which
have
set
forth
–
set
by
this
court
concerning
the
handling
of
such
a
case.
therefore,
it's
somewhat
equivalent
as
my
wife
used
to
say,
“you
can
understand
that
i
have
a
lot
of
pain
when
i
have
a
child,
but
you
will
never
experience
it.”
there
is
a
lot
of
pain
in
the
trial
in
trying
to
work
out
the
rules
which
have
been
established
by
this
court.
the
second
proposition
is
that
this
court
has
expressed
or
perhaps
not
expressed,
but
vocalized
the
assumption
that
lower
courts
and
lower
judges,
both
state
and
federal,
will
obey
the
mandates
of
this
court
when
it
comes
to
deciding
on
obscenity
case.
this
case
is
an
illustration
of
the
fact
that
such
an
assumption
is
totally
false
and
is
an
illustration
of
what,
in
my
opinion,
is
a
immutable
proposition
that
when
you
are
dealing
with
obscenity
or
dealing
with
pornography
that
for
the
most
part
it
is
a
visceral
turn
off
to
the
majority
of
the
courts
and
which
you
in
front
off.
and
thus
you
may,
as
in
this
case
present
un-controvertible
proof,
uncontested
proof
that
the
material
is
protected.
un-controverted
proof
and
irrevocable
proof
that
there
has
been
a
prior
judicial
decision
as
it
was
in
this
case,
uncontested
by
the
state
that
the
material
was
constitutionally
protected
and
that
nevertheless
the
defendant
must
endure
what
in
this
case
case
was
a
seven-week
trial
plus
some
other
various
procedural
propositions
which
i
will
outline.
and
i
think
this
might
also
illustrate,
why
this
court,
i
think,
was
absolutely
wrong
in
harris
v.
younger
or
younger
v.
harris
and
its
progeny
in
holding
that
one
criminal
prosecution
is
not
any
type
of
a
hardship
upon
a
defendant
at
least
in
the
area
of
obscenity
because
the
criminal
and
it
might
also
illustrate
the
fact,
something
that
i
am
going
to
urge
to
this
court,
that
there
should
be
an
attempt
to
delineate
the
difference
between
an
obscenity
prosecution
and
a
prosecution
under
the
ordinary
rules
of
criminal
procedure
because
they
do
not
jibe
and
for
the
past
10
or
15
years
since
roth
courts
have
been
trying
to
tear
or
take
the
obscenity
issues
and
weave
them
and
fold
them
into
the
area
or
environment
of
a
criminal
trial.
and
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure
just
do
not
meet
the
issues.
a
suggestion
is
going
to
be
then
if
my
analysis
is
correct
that
this
court
must
faction
some
procedural
rules
for
the
conduct
of
obscenity
cases
along
the
lines
of
mapp
versus
ohio
because
as
this
court
well
know
there
has
been
a
total
chaos
in
this
area.
now,
the
first
proposition
that
i
have
with
respect
to
the
rules
laid
down
by
this
court
is
that
there
is
a
new
irreconcilable
conflict
between
the
decisions
of
this
court.
irreconcilable
in
the
sense
that
they
are
logically
inconsistent,
however,
one
court
pointed
up
and
i
have
not
been
able
to
find
the
case,
that
logic
is
the
dominion
and
not
the
master
of
the
law.
so,
we
can
avoid
that
little
proposition
that
perhaps
this
court
has
been
logically
inconsistent
because
it
really
doesn't
matter
if
we
can
fashion
some
rules
where
we
can
handle
what
we
are
doing.
mr.
burton
marks
i
am
talking
about
roth
versus
stanley
and
round
in
the
circle,
back
to
reidel
and
perhaps
a
little
shaking
of
redrup,
a
pinch
of
redrup
just
to
give
us
some,
perhaps
give
defense
attorneys
a
taste
of
heaven,
again
we
get
a
redrup
decision.
i
am
assuming
for
the
purpose
of
this
particular
case
that
we
don't
have
a
redrup
issue
because
presumably
this
court
would
decide
this
case
on
its
easiest
merits
and
that
is,
it's
constitutionally
protected
as
a
matter
of
law.
what
we
have
here,
in
fact,
is
a
very
interesting
proposition.
mr.
miller
as
the
evidence
somewhat
points
out,
is
president
of
incorporation
which
sends
out
advertising
brochures.
the
sender
of
the
brochures
or
the
place
where
the
mailings
originate
was
cavina,
which
is
in
the
county
of
los
angeles.
in
the
county
of
orange
which
is
the
neighboring
county,
a
prosecution
was
commenced
in
addition
to
this
prosecution
for
violation
of
section
311.2
for
the
brochures
which
are
illustrated
history
of
pornography,
sex
orgies
illustrated
in
the
book
entitled
“man/woman.”
there
were
several
prosecutions
--
mr.
burton
marks
i
believe
they
have
been
setup.
these
exhibits
were
--
and
are
described
if
you
please
in
the
opinion
of
judge
arguelles
in
the
los
angeles
municipal
court
in
east
lost
angeles
area.
his
description
of
what
the
material
contained
is
at
page
18
of
the
reporter's
transcript
and
it
repeats
what
--
essentially
what
responded
his
trying
to
hoist
upon
this
court
that
there
were
picture
of,
if
you
please,
cunnilingus
or
oral
copulation,
sodomy,
oral
intercourse
between
a
man
and
a
woman.
in
fact,
these
particular
pictures
are
drawings,
artistic
seems
be
irrelevant.
the
fact
that
some
of
them
are
copies
of
fresckles
or
frescoes
which
come
from
indian
art,
japanese
art,
also
seems
to
be
irrelevant
since
it
becomes
the
job
of
the
jury
to
determine
under
certain
rules
laid
down
whether
or
not
they
are
“obscene
or
not
obscene.”
and
also
the
job
apparently
of
some
experts
to
determine
whether
the
average
person
looking
at
the
pictures
as
they
come
to
them
through
the
mail,
the
average,
a
non-consenting
adult,
let's
assume
that
that's
the
class
we
are
talking
about,
that
the
average
non-consenting
adult
upon
seeing
these
pictures
will
have
an
immediate
appeal
to
his
prurient
interest
because
of
this
exhibition.
it
doesn't
seem
to
follow,
there
does
not
seem
to
be
much
empirical
evidence
and
i
have
a
red
light.
mr.
burton
marks
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we’re
back
again
before
the
court,
since
january
of
this
year
to
reargue
the
matter
and
to
discuss
with
the
court
what
one
of
my
colleagues
described
as
the
continuing
saga
of
life
in
the
pits
or
what
goes
on
in
the
lower
courts
because
we
don’t
know
what
actually
this
court
is
saying
with
respect
to
the
pornography.
the
second
proposition
that
we
have
to
this
court
is
that
a
person
charged
with
the
crime
of
obscenity
should
have
perhaps
as
much
rights
accorded
to
him
or
her
as,
let’s
say
a
parolee
who
is
being
having
his
parole
revoked
or
perhaps
a
juvenile
who
is
being
declared
a
delinquent.
perhaps
i
can
explain.
as
i
said,
there
is
a
continuation
of
horrors.
in
january,
i
described
to
the
court
what
happened
in
this
case,
what
a
defense
lawyer
had
to
do
to
go
through
a
trial
or
proceeding
in
order
to
at
least
have
attempted
to
have
some
kind
of
hearing
as
to
whether
or
not
the
material
was
constitutionally
protected.
this
included
pre-trial
hearings
in
which
evidences
presented
by
the
defendant,
none
by
the
prosecution
and
a
complete
denial
of
any
real
hearing
in
my
opinion,
understanding
by
the
trial
judge
as
to
what
the
issues
were.
since
that
time,
to
give
you
an
example
of
what
occurs
in
the
courts
below
because
of
the
erratic,
if
i
may
say
types
of
decisions
which
emanate
from
the
higher
courts
and
perhaps,
the
visceral
reactions
that
occur
with
various
judges
is.
i’ve
been
in
three
trials
since
i’ve
seen
it
and
this
court
in
wiener
versus
california
held
certain
material
to
be
protected
vis-à-vis
redrup.
now,
the
wiener
materials
were
down
in
san
diego
and
they
involve
some
motion
pictures
and
some
films.
so,
we
--
i
had
two
trials
in
los
angeles
in
which
i
attempted
to
have
the
judge
take
some
recognition
of
the
materials
in
wiener,
so
that
there
could
be
a
comparison
of
what
was
protected
and
what
was
not
protected.
now,
the
interesting
proposition
is
that
the
prosecution
--
mr.
burton
marks
no,
we
waive
jury.
the
interesting
proposition
in
the
first
trial
that
i
had
was
that
the
prosecution
had
an
attorney
who
was
reasonably
experienced
in
the
pornography
field.
this
prosecutor
was
unwilling
to
admit
to
the
court
as
were
the
police
officers
who
were
are
really
the
experts
because
in
los
angeles
they
a
vice
squad
with
pornography
experts
that
travel
through
and
the
state
and
they
know
what’s
going
on.
the
state
refused
to
admit
that
the
materials
in
my
case
were
the
same
as
the
materials
in
wiener.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
refused
to
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
they
were
the
same
and
there
was
simply
no
way
to
get
the
wiener
materials
from
san
diego
to
los
angeles
because
they
had
been
introduced
into
another
case
in
san
diego
to
try
and
persuade
the
second
judge
that
the
materials
were
the
same
and
therefore
protected.
mr.
burton
marks
in
the
--
in
the
last,
well,
the
first
case
i
did
because
the
judge
that
we
finally
got
was,
in
my
opinion,
sophisticated
enough
to
understand
what
was
going
on.
mr.
burton
marks
no.
absolutely
not.
no,
the
--
because
if
you’re
allowed
to
have
the
procedures
which
the
california
state
allows
you
to
have,
you
have
--
you
should
have
under
noroff
a
real
pre-trial
hearing
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
material
is
obscene.
mr.
burton
marks
which
would
end
the
case
but
the
unfortunate
proposition
is,
as
i
was
going
to
point
out
is
that
the
judges
simply
don’t
follow
the
law.
they
don’t
--
perhaps,
it’s
merely
a
matter
of
buck-passing
and
as
former
president
trumann
said,
the
bucks
got
some
--
mr.
burton
marks
well,
that’s
a
very
interesting
--
of
course
not.
of
course
that
--
mr.
burton
marks
of
course.
mr.
burton
marks
sometimes
what
the
judges
feel
or
believe
is
and
there’s
some
california
case
law
to
that
effect.
although
it
really
does
not
seem
to
be
appropriate
because
ordinarily,
we’re
talking
about
a
misdemeanor
case
in
obscenity.
the
only
time
you
get
into
a
felony
case
is
when
it
is
bootstrapped
into
a
felony
by
virtue
of
the
charge
of
conspiracy
which
makes
it
a
felony
or
because
a
person
has
a
second
offense.
now,
if
you
have
a
misdemeanor
trial,
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
preliminary
hearing.
there
--
so,
the
california
supreme
court
gave
misdemeanants
in
a
pornography
case
essentially
what
might
be
called
a
preliminary
hearing
through
the
noroff
case
in
which
you
are
entitled
to
have
a
hearing
to
determine
whether
there’s
obscenity.
now,
some
judges
believe
that
this
only
means
probable
cause.
mr.
burton
marks
yes.
some
judges
believe
that
this
obscenity
issue
in
determination
means
only
probable
cause
to
believe
that’s
obscene,
so
it
will
grow
in
front
of
a
jury,
that
is
not
my
understanding
of
the
law
but
there’s
no
clear-cut
decision
on
that
proposition.
in
a
felony
case,
if
you
happen
to
have
a
felony,
then
you
have
a
preliminary
hearing
and
in
that
preliminary
hearing,
there
is
a
probable
cause
situation
to
believe
that
a
crime
has
been
committed.
again,
there
is
a
case
out
of
california
called
luros
which
says
that
the
grand
jury
does
not
need
any
evidence
to
make
a
determination
of
probable
cause,
so
that
the
matter
can
be
brought
before
the
petit
jury
for
a
trial.
but
then
we
have
again
this
intermediate
noroff
step
which
supposedly
is
suppose
to
have
the
judge
independently
make
a
determination
of
obscenity.
it’s
always
been
my
expression
or
opinion
that
the
proof
of
the
prosecution
as
to
obscenity
in
a
pretrial
hearing
has
to
be
also
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
because
if
it’s
not
obscene,
it
can’t
be
prosecuted.
but,
as
i
say,
this
leaves
the
law
in
the
state
of
flux
and
nobody
really
seems
to
care.
i
was
talking
about
the
trials
that
i
had.
but
what
happened
was
the
wiener,
the
two
defendants
had
been
arrested
in
a
practically
the
same
situation.
they
were
the
type
of
defendant
that
you
will
ordinarily
find
and
as
far
as
i
can
determine,
90
to
95%
of
the
cases
which
come
before
this
court
or
before
any
obscenity
court,
i.e.
a
book
seller,
a
motion
picture
operator,
somebody
who
is
in
business,
not
the
skulking
pornographer
who
goes
out
into
the
alleys
and
calls
in
the
little
kids
and
says,
“look
at
the
dirty
pictures.”
he’s
there,
he
has
a
store,
he
has
a
business,
he
has
a
movie
theater,
he
invites
no
one
in
except
by
the
advertisement.
generally,
if
you
take
a
look,
for
instance,
you
open
your
washington
dc
newspapers
and
there’s
advertising
for
what’s
known
as
adult
films
and
it
doesn’t
pictorially
describe
what’s
being
shown.
it
gives
the
title
and
the
persons
who
are
the,
to
say
the
aficionados
or
the
--
who
want
to
go
to
the
theatres,
know
what’s
going
to
be
shown
on
the
theatres
by
the
fact
of
the
title
and
the
place
where
the
theater
is
and
they
go
and
see
it.
but
i’m
talking
about
the
client,
the
person
who
is
in
business,
he’s
operating
a
store,
he
buys
film,
he
buys
books
and
he
sells
it
to
the
persons
who
come
in.
ordinarily,
there’s
no
such
thing
as
pandering
as
was
described
in
ginsberg.
simply,
a
police
officer
walks
in,
sees
a
piece
of
material
that
he
doesn’t
think
is
a
worthy
of
his
consideration,
either
makes
an
arrest
on
the
spot,
although
that
is
now
out
in
california
but
generally,
will
go
back
and
make
an
affidavit
that
he
saw
a
dirty
book
or
a
dirty
picture
and
he
will
describe
why
it
was
dirty
and
then
some
magistrate
will
sign
a
search
warrant
and
they’ll
go
in
and
seize
that.
sometime,--
mr.
burton
marks
sometimes,
they
do
but
very
seldom.
apparently,
there
is
not
enough
funds
given
to
the
vice
squad
to
purchase
this
type
of
material.
they
have
other
areas.
they
generally
go
in
and
they
look
at
the
pictures.
my
two
clients
happen
to
have
arcades
on
main
street
where
you
have
peep
shows
and
little
motion
pictures
theatres.
police
officers
went
in,
saw
the
films,
went
back,
described
what
they
saw
or
what
they
thought
they
saw,
gave
the
affidavit
to
a
magistrate,
authorize
the
seizure,
they
came
back
a
few
days
later,
seized
the
film,
took
it
to
the
police
station
then
had
an
arrest
warrant
issued.
both
clients
were
charged
with
felonies
because
they
were,
had
a
prior
misdemeanor.
mr.
burton
marks
evidence.
in
the
first
case,
the
judge,
after
i’d
waived
jury
and
after
i’d
been
able
to
present
an
expert
who
had
seen
the
wiener
material
and
seen
this
material
which
was
called
simulated,
testified
it
was
exactly
the
same
and
i
presented
to
the
judge
a
list
of
cases
that
--
and
showed
him
how
the
material
was
exactly
the
same.
he
finally
read
the
material
and
lo
and
behold
after
an
entire
trial
in
which
the
police
officer
testified
in
their
expertise
as
to
what
was
obscene
and
not
obscene
and
my
expert
had
shown
the
comparison
between
wiener
material
and
these
materials,
the
judge
granted
my
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
grounds
that
the
material
was
constitutionally
protected
and
returned
the
films
to
me.
the
next
case
was
exactly
the
same.
it
was
another
person
at
an
arcade
next
door.
i
went
into
the
second
judge
who
had
never
had
a
pornography
case,
never
had
an
obscenity
case
but
of
course
knew
what
was
obscene
and
not
obscene,
tried
to
persuade
him
that
this
case
that
i
had
today
was
exactly
the
same
case
as
the
case
i
had
yesterday
and
that
in
fact
the
ruling
of
the
judge
before
was
res
judicata
because
it
wasn’t
an
acquittal.
it
was
declaration
of
protected
material.
the
second
judge
--
mr.
burton
marks
well,
it
would
at
least
be
collateral
estoppel
under
ashe
versus
swenson
because
the
prosecution
has
to
be
stopped
from
continuing
to
prosecute
something
which
they
must
know
is
protected.
it
was
the
same
district
attorney’s
office.
mr.
burton
marks
no,
no,
a
different
defendant
but
the
same
material.
now,
somewhere
along
the
line,
if
the
defendant
or
a
person
in
a
criminal
case
who
was
charged
with
a
criminal
offense
is
--
must
have
the
opportunity
of
saying,
“look,
i
am
protected.”
isn’t
that
what
scienter
means?
doesn’t
scienter
mean
that
the
person
is
doing
something
which
he
thinks
is
alright
or
conversely
if
you
want
to
prove
that
he
had
mens
rea
of
the
offense,
he
had
to
know
or
at
least
have
reason
to
believe
that
the
material
which
he
was
selling
or
exhibiting
or
purveying
was
not
protected
or
in
the
realm
of
hardcore
pornography.
but
these
booksellers
don’t
know
that
because
they
get
a
decision
from
redrup,
a
protected
material
and
then
down
it
comes
to
the
lowest
court
and
sometimes
even
the
highest
court
and
they
say,
we
don’t
believe
it.
nobody
could
hold
anything
like
that
to
be
protected.
mr.
burton
marks
no,
there
is
--
the
aspects
of
it
blowing
in
the
wind
but
it’s
not
legislative.
it
would
be
judicial
because
of
some
recent
decisions
that
came
out
of
the
district
court,
three-judge
courts
and
the
central
district
of
california
stating
that
perhaps
the
search
and
seizure
statutes
which
we
have
and
the
1538.5
of
the
penal
code
which
allows
for
a
traverse
to
a
search
warrant.
although
it
doesn’t
meet
the
freedman
requirements
of
the
blount
versus
rizzi
requirements
of
a
fast
hearing
provided
by
the
state.
at
least,
one
court
has
said,
that’s
sufficient
hearing
and
you
can
probably
traverse
the
search
warrant
on
the
basis
that
the
material
was
not
in
fact
obscene
and
couldn’t
be
seized
because
that’s
the
law
in
the
state
of
california.
also,
if
it’s
protected,
it
can’t
be
seized
but
the
big
problem
is
how
do
you
get
word
to
the
judge
that
it’s
protected?
mr.
burton
marks
it
ought
to
be.
but
what
happens
is
that
the
judge
will
say
as
he
did
in
the
second
case.
first
of
all,
i
don’t
--
these
aren’t
exactly
the
same
materials,
so
therefore
they
must
be
different
and
you
can
argue
all
day
long
that
that
one
portrayal
of
an
active
sexual
intercourse
is
very
much
like
another
act
of
sexual
intercourse.
mr.
burton
marks
i’m
talking
about
two
films
that
if
you
put
them
back-to-back
and
took
away
the
faces
of
the
actors,
it
would
be
impossible
to
describe
any
difference
in
what
was
portrayed
on
the
screen.
mr.
burton
marks
right.
some
of
them
may
have
different
titles
but
there
just
is
no
way,
i
recall
the
old
saying,
you’ve
seen
one,
you’ve
seen
them
both.
you’ve
seen
--
mr.
burton
marks
well,
it’s
got
to
help
somebody.
mr.
burton
marks
well,
that
i
guess
is
the
big
problem.
because
if
i
see
a
magazine
that
shows
a
picture
of
a
naked
woman
with
her
legs
spread
but
is
known
in
the
trade
as
a
beaver
shot
and
this
court
has
said,
“that’s
protected.”
and
i
see
another
magazine
with
a
woman
with
her
legs
spread
and
a
beaver
shot
with
a
different
title
and
a
different
woman,
i
would
like
to
be
able
to
tell
my
client,
it’s
alright
to
sell
that
because
it’s
been
held
protected
but
some
courts
will
say,
“well,
that’s
ridiculous.
it’s
a
different
woman
and
it’s
a
different
camera
angle
and
it’s
a
different
magazine,
so
how
could
the
material
be
protected?”
one
of
the
most
beautiful
cases
in
point
and
it
was
handed
to
me
by
my
brother
mr.
cello
who
will
be
arguing
later
as
a
case
of
wisconsin
versus
simpson
out
of
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
filed
october
31,
1972
and
in
that
case,
they
had,
from
what
i
can
determine,
magazines
with
nude
persons
together
and
nothing
more
and
here
is
some
of
the
holdings
of
the
wisconsin
supreme
court.
incidentally,
i
had
brought
it
along
and
now
i
don’t
seem
to
be
able
to
find
it
in
the
recent
article,
the
most
recent
edition
of
the
new
york
magazine.
there’s
a
little
cartoon
that
shows
two
gentlemen
in
black
robes
strolling
along
and
one
of
them
is
saying,
“if
it
turns
me
on,
it’s
smut.”
so,
that’s
about
what
happened
with
the
wisconsin
supreme
court.
here’s
what
they
say,
described
magazines
are
not,
as
a
matter
of
law,
not
obscene.
this
was
the
contention
raised.
appellant
argues
that
these
magazines
cannot
be
found
obscene
because
only
nudity
is
depicted
and
not
sexual
activity.
given
non-obscenity
for
non-sexuality
are
just
--
argues
appellant,
these
complaints
are
not
sufficient
because
they
do
not
allege
obscene
depictions
of
sexual
activity.
supportive
of
this
proposition,
appellants
asserts
several
redrup
reversals.
and
certain
language
in
state
versus
amato
they
go
down.
this
court,
in
court
versus
state
resoundingly
rejected
the
contention
therein
presented
that
this
court
is
bound
by
the
decisions
in
other
courts
regarding
whether
similar
magazines
are
obscene
or
not.
and
he
puts
in
quotes,
“the
subjective
nature
of
the
material
as
well
as
the
subjective
conduct
of
the
respective
defendant
requires
an
individual
analysis
in
each
case.”
a
complete
rejection
by
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
of
what
this
court
said
in
redrup
that
certain
material
is
protected.
they
say,
“we’ll
tell
you
whether
or
not
it’s
protected.
we’ll
tell
you
whether
or
not
we
viscerally
have
that
feeling.”
another
example,
of
the
type
of
reaction
you
get
from
the
lower
courts,
the
question
is,
was
the
introduction
of
the
magazines
in
the
evidence
without
further
evidence
sufficient
to
prove
their
obscenity
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt?
and
they
say,
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
obscenity
is
not
so
illusive.
the
concept
is
to
require
expert
testimony.
there’s
nothing
here
that
warrants
any
further
consideration
of
that
question
and
the
evidence
in
the
form
of
the
magazines
themselves
was
clearly
sufficient
to
prove
obscenity
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
you
know
how
this
case
went
to
trial
?they
took
the
magazines
and
threw
them
into
the
jury
and
said,
“this
is
what
the
man
is
selling.”
and
remember
these
are
magazines
of
a
man
and
a
woman
in
nude
and
that’s
all
they’re
doing
and
the
court
is
saying,
“we
will
ignore
everything
and
we’re
going
to
go
our
own
way.”
what
do
you
do?
well
--
mr.
burton
marks
absolutely,
assuming
that
you
can
find
some
judges
in
the
district
courts,
the
federal
district
courts
that
will
follow
the
law
of
this
court
because
you
don’t
always
follow
that
either.
i
was
continuing
my
saga
for
which
this
court
is
very
familiar
with
a
case
where
there
were
20,000
rolls
of
films
seized
in
southern
california
and
the
district
courts
held
they
couldn’t
be
seized,
it
was
unlawful
and
judge
hanson
of
the
superior
court
said,
who
i
knew
in
effect
and
it
went
to
the
court
of
appeal.
judge
hanson
was
never
held
in
contempt,
of
course,
because
judges
are
immune
from
that
sort
of
thing
and
it
went
through
three
or
four
or
five
respective
courts,
finally
came
up
to
this
court
which
affirmed
the
district
court
three-judge
ruling
and
finally,
when
the
films
got
back
after
five
or
six
months
of
the
most
extraordinary
waste
of
time,
in
my
opinion.
getting
back
to
the
initial
premise
of
my
argument,
can’t
we
give
a
defendant
in
a
pornography
case
the
same
due
process
of
law
that
you
give
with
a
juvenile
or
that
you
give
a
parolee?
can’t
he
have
a
hearing
such
as
you
said
in
morrissey?
can’t
he
have
the
same
presumption
of
innocence
that
is
to
say
in
winship?
you
said
due
process
says
that
each
element
of
the
offense
must
be
proved
by
competent
evidence
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
well,
we
have
three
elements
of
the
offense.
we
actually
have
four.
they
were
stated
in
this
court
in
roth.
they
were
stated
in
memoirs
and
it
was
just
recently
approved
by
this
court
in
rabe
versus
washington
which
approved
roth
and
memoirs
as
to
the
three
elements.
the
three
elements
are
very
simple.
does
it
go
beyond
contemporary
standards
as
appeal
to
the
prurient
interest?
is
it
utterly
without
socially
redeeming
value?
doesn’t
the
prosecution
have
the
burden
of
proving
those
elements,
first
amendment
elements
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
so
that
defendant
can
have
a
hearing
and
a
trial
on
it
and
don’t
they
have
to
present
evidence,
competent
evidence?
i
say
that
due
process
as
they
do.
the
fourth
element
is
even
more
illusive
and
that’s
the
scienter
element.
smith
versus
california
said
you’ve
got
to
know
what
you’re
doing.
the
basic
element
of
due
process
of
law
is
that
you
have
mens
rea
of
criminal
intent.
this
people
are
businessman.
maybe
they’re
on
a
dirty
business
that
you
don’t
like
but
nevertheless,
they
are
in
business.
they
don’t
want
--
mr.
burton
marks
i
say
that
he
must
know
what’s
in
the
book
is
illegal
or
probably
illegal
because
if
you
just
say,
you
know
what’s
in
the
book,
then
you
get
in
to
the
wild
speculation.
does
that
mean
that
he
knows
that
there’s
some
pictures
of
nude
people?
does
he
know
it’s
sexually
oriented?
the
bible
is
sexually
oriented
if
you
take
some
passages.
what
do
you
have
to
know
about
the
contents
of
the
book?
i
think
you
have
to
know
or
have
some
reason
to
believe
that
he
knows
that
this
has
gone
beyond
what
that
which
is
legally
protected.
mr.
burton
marks
well,
it
goes
a
little
bit
further
but
it
has
to
be
a
logical
and
rational
extension
of
that
scienter
requirement
because
if
you
don’t
have
that
scienter
requirement,
you
might
as
well
overrule
smith
versus
california
and
say
anybody
who
sells
a
book
or
to
show
the
motion
picture
that
deals
with
sex
is
subject
to
arrest
and
prosecution
under
some
standards
which
are
slightly
less
than
the
standards
which
are
afforded
to
most
other
criminals.
i
say,
finally,
there’s
an
instruction
that
used
to
be
given
in
a
series
of
time.
it
says
in
the
federal
courts,
to
the
jury,
“if
he’s
guilty,
say
so.
if
he’s
not
guilty,
say
so.”
i
say
in
this
instance,
if
you’re
going
to
give
us
some
standards,
and
you’re
going
to
say
that
the
first
amendment
applies
to
the
states,
say
so.
and
if
you’re
going
to
tell
that
the
courts
below
that
they
can’t
seize
a
material
without
having
an
adversary
hearing
or
some
sort
of
hearing
afforded
to
the
person,
say
so.
and
if
you’re
going
to
say
that
they
can’t
prosecute
without
having
a
hearing
or
to
some
determination
as
the
material,
say
so.
but
--
mr.
burton
marks
an
injunctive
type
of
proceeding.
mr.
burton
marks
in
--
i
think
that
if
you’re
--
first
of
all,
i
have
never
seen
a
case
since
ginsberg
which
has
that
type
of
pandering.
i
think
that
that
case
is
out
in
that
field
and
will
never
happen
again
but
if
it
does
happen
again,
this
court
has
found
ways
to
get
around
what
have
otherwise
been
apparently
restrictive
rules
of
law.
if
the
person
is
pandering
and
he
knows
it,
the
law
allows
for
it,
there’s
room
for
all
of
those,
that
type
of
exception.
thank
you.
mr.
burton
marks
no,
i
think
what
they
must
be
--
the
only
thing
that
they
can
bind
the
defendant
on
in
a
separate
question
is
scienter.
after
that
hearing,
no
other
defendant
can
go
about
and
say
i
didn’t
know
it
was
protected
because
the
law
presumes
that
everybody
else
knows
the
law.
mr.
burton
marks
oh,
he
can
defend
on
the
ground
that
it’s
not
obscene
because
i
would
say
this,
as
long
as
your
procedure
is
going
along,
you’d
obviously
have
to
have
an
in
rem
proceeding
with
the
right
to
appeal
by
whoever
is
appealing
but
the
question
of
scienter
knowledge
of
as
to
whether
it’s
obscene
would
be
withdraw
because
don’t
forget,
in
a
in
rem
proceeding
you
have
a
judge
sitting
there
and
the
judge
can
rule
on
the
--
i
think
that
the
only
thing
that
judge
can
rule
on
is
whether
or
not
the
book
is
not
obscene.
if
he
rules
that
he
will
not
make
such
a
finding
that
the
book
is
not
obscene
that
it
is
not
protected,
then
notices
given
to
the
world
as
it
were
to
the
criminal
defendants
that
this
may
be
the
subject
of
a
prosecution
because
he
can’t
foreclose
by
saying
that
the
book
is
obscene,
the
right
of
a
criminal
defendant
in
a
case
to
have
a
jury
trial
on
that
issue.
mr.
burton
marks
absolutely
and
that’s
the
way
it
should
be.
thank
you.
mr.
burton
marks
very
briefly,
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i
say
this,
i
may
have
some
disagreement
as
to
whether
probable
cause
hearing
is
different
from
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
hearing
and
i
personally
feel
that
chapman
versus
california
would
not
militate
or
necessitate
a
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
hearing.
but
that’s
not
the
point.
the
point
is,
give
us
a
hearing
and
let
us
work
it
out.
that’s
what
happened
before.
give
us
a
hearing.
let
that
person
have
his
chance
in
court
not
in
a
criminal
prosecution
which
was
never
meant
to
apply
to
a
first
amendment
case.
mr.
burton
marks
give
us
a
hearing
which
will
find
the
states,
so
that
they
can’t
continue
to
harass
and
prosecute
for
the
same
type
of
material.
mr.
burton
marks
no,
the
same
type.
mr.
burton
marks
well,
somebody
knows
it
when
they
see
it
and
you
can
look
at
it
and
there’s
no,
this
is
no
question.
mr.
burton
marks
if
you
are
doing
a
jury
by
jury,
you’re
doing
it
on
a
proposition
that
one
type
of
material
has
already
been
declared
to
be
materially
protected
and
you
can’t
even
bring
that
type
of
evidence
in
some
cases
before
a
jury
or
before
a
judge
to
a
stop.
mr.
burton
marks
oh,
that
has
happened
but
that
is
not
what
i’m
saying.
perhaps,
what
i’m
saying
is
that
the
defendant
has
to
have
a
chance
to
know
before
he
can
be
put
before
the
jury
and
made
to
do
something
and
the
state
should
give
the
opportunity
and
they
should
be
forced
to
produced
the
evidence
by
an
impartial
state,
not
the
police
officer
testifying
as
the
expert
but
impartial
evidence
before
an
impartial
judge.
that’s
what
we
need.
mr.
burton
marks
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
purpose
of
my
argument
to
which
eventually
i
hope
will
tie-in
with
the
questions
which
are
raised
on
the
certiorari,
i
am
going
to
make
some
statements
which
may
sound
as
if
they
are
pejorative
or
demeaning,
they
are
not
so
intended.
i
express
them
merely
as
a
statement
of
what
i
have
experienced
in
the
defense
of
obscenity
cases.
my
first
observation
is
that,
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
probably,
no
member
of
this
court
has
gauged
either
the
prosecution
or
the
defense
of
an
obscenity
case
where
you
are
required
to
deal
with
the
various
rules
of
law
and
procedure
which
have
set
forth
–
set
by
this
court
concerning
the
handling
of
such
a
case.
therefore,
it's
somewhat
equivalent
as
my
wife
used
to
say,
“you
can
understand
that
i
have
a
lot
of
pain
when
i
have
a
child,
but
you
will
never
experience
it.”
there
is
a
lot
of
pain
in
the
trial
in
trying
to
work
out
the
rules
which
have
been
established
by
this
court.
the
second
proposition
is
that
this
court
has
expressed
or
perhaps
not
expressed,
but
vocalized
the
assumption
that
lower
courts
and
lower
judges,
both
state
and
federal,
will
obey
the
mandates
of
this
court
when
it
comes
to
deciding
on
obscenity
case.
this
case
is
an
illustration
of
the
fact
that
such
an
assumption
is
totally
false
and
is
an
illustration
of
what,
in
my
opinion,
is
a
immutable
proposition
that
when
you
are
dealing
with
obscenity
or
dealing
with
pornography
that
for
the
most
part
it
is
a
visceral
turn
off
to
the
majority
of
the
courts
and
which
you
in
front
off.
and
thus
you
may,
as
in
this
case
present
un-controvertible
proof,
uncontested
proof
that
the
material
is
protected.
un-controverted
proof
and
irrevocable
proof
that
there
has
been
a
prior
judicial
decision
as
it
was
in
this
case,
uncontested
by
the
state
that
the
material
was
constitutionally
protected
and
that
nevertheless
the
defendant
must
endure
what
in
this
case
case
was
a
seven-week
trial
plus
some
other
various
procedural
propositions
which
i
will
outline.
and
i
think
this
might
also
illustrate,
why
this
court,
i
think,
was
absolutely
wrong
in
harris
v.
younger
or
younger
v.
harris
and
its
progeny
in
holding
that
one
criminal
prosecution
is
not
any
type
of
a
hardship
upon
a
defendant
at
least
in
the
area
of
obscenity
because
the
criminal
and
it
might
also
illustrate
the
fact,
something
that
i
am
going
to
urge
to
this
court,
that
there
should
be
an
attempt
to
delineate
the
difference
between
an
obscenity
prosecution
and
a
prosecution
under
the
ordinary
rules
of
criminal
procedure
because
they
do
not
jibe
and
for
the
past
10
or
15
years
since
roth
courts
have
been
trying
to
tear
or
take
the
obscenity
issues
and
weave
them
and
fold
them
into
the
area
or
environment
of
a
criminal
trial.
and
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure
just
do
not
meet
the
issues.
a
suggestion
is
going
to
be
then
if
my
analysis
is
correct
that
this
court
must
faction
some
procedural
rules
for
the
conduct
of
obscenity
cases
along
the
lines
of
mapp
versus
ohio
because
as
this
court
well
know
there
has
been
a
total
chaos
in
this
area.
now,
the
first
proposition
that
i
have
with
respect
to
the
rules
laid
down
by
this
court
is
that
there
is
a
new
irreconcilable
conflict
between
the
decisions
of
this
court.
irreconcilable
in
the
sense
that
they
are
logically
inconsistent,
however,
one
court
pointed
up
and
i
have
not
been
able
to
find
the
case,
that
logic
is
the
dominion
and
not
the
master
of
the
law.
so,
we
can
avoid
that
little
proposition
that
perhaps
this
court
has
been
logically
inconsistent
because
it
really
doesn't
matter
if
we
can
fashion
some
rules
where
we
can
handle
what
we
are
doing.
mr.
burton
marks
i
am
talking
about
roth
versus
stanley
and
round
in
the
circle,
back
to
reidel
and
perhaps
a
little
shaking
of
redrup,
a
pinch
of
redrup
just
to
give
us
some,
perhaps
give
defense
attorneys
a
taste
of
heaven,
again
we
get
a
redrup
decision.
i
am
assuming
for
the
purpose
of
this
particular
case
that
we
don't
have
a
redrup
issue
because
presumably
this
court
would
decide
this
case
on
its
easiest
merits
and
that
is,
it's
constitutionally
protected
as
a
matter
of
law.
what
we
have
here,
in
fact,
is
a
very
interesting
proposition.
mr.
miller
as
the
evidence
somewhat
points
out,
is
president
of
incorporation
which
sends
out
advertising
brochures.
the
sender
of
the
brochures
or
the
place
where
the
mailings
originate
was
cavina,
which
is
in
the
county
of
los
angeles.
in
the
county
of
orange
which
is
the
neighboring
county,
a
prosecution
was
commenced
in
addition
to
this
prosecution
for
violation
of
section
311.2
for
the
brochures
which
are
illustrated
history
of
pornography,
sex
orgies
illustrated
in
the
book
entitled
“man/woman.”
there
were
several
prosecutions
--
mr.
burton
marks
i
believe
they
have
been
setup.
these
exhibits
were
--
and
are
described
if
you
please
in
the
opinion
of
judge
arguelles
in
the
los
angeles
municipal
court
in
east
lost
angeles
area.
his
description
of
what
the
material
contained
is
at
page
18
of
the
reporter's
transcript
and
it
repeats
what
--
essentially
what
responded
his
trying
to
hoist
upon
this
court
that
there
were
picture
of,
if
you
please,
cunnilingus
or
oral
copulation,
sodomy,
oral
intercourse
between
a
man
and
a
woman.
in
fact,
these
particular
pictures
are
drawings,
artistic
seems
be
irrelevant.
the
fact
that
some
of
them
are
copies
of
fresckles
or
frescoes
which
come
from
indian
art,
japanese
art,
also
seems
to
be
irrelevant
since
it
becomes
the
job
of
the
jury
to
determine
under
certain
rules
laid
down
whether
or
not
they
are
“obscene
or
not
obscene.”
and
also
the
job
apparently
of
some
experts
to
determine
whether
the
average
person
looking
at
the
pictures
as
they
come
to
them
through
the
mail,
the
average,
a
non-consenting
adult,
let's
assume
that
that's
the
class
we
are
talking
about,
that
the
average
non-consenting
adult
upon
seeing
these
pictures
will
have
an
immediate
appeal
to
his
prurient
interest
because
of
this
exhibition.
it
doesn't
seem
to
follow,
there
does
not
seem
to
be
much
empirical
evidence
and
i
have
a
red
light.
mr.
burton
marks
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we’re
back
again
before
the
court,
since
january
of
this
year
to
reargue
the
matter
and
to
discuss
with
the
court
what
one
of
my
colleagues
described
as
the
continuing
saga
of
life
in
the
pits
or
what
goes
on
in
the
lower
courts
because
we
don’t
know
what
actually
this
court
is
saying
with
respect
to
the
pornography.
the
second
proposition
that
we
have
to
this
court
is
that
a
person
charged
with
the
crime
of
obscenity
should
have
perhaps
as
much
rights
accorded
to
him
or
her
as,
let’s
say
a
parolee
who
is
being
having
his
parole
revoked
or
perhaps
a
juvenile
who
is
being
declared
a
delinquent.
perhaps
i
can
explain.
as
i
said,
there
is
a
continuation
of
horrors.
in
january,
i
described
to
the
court
what
happened
in
this
case,
what
a
defense
lawyer
had
to
do
to
go
through
a
trial
or
proceeding
in
order
to
at
least
have
attempted
to
have
some
kind
of
hearing
as
to
whether
or
not
the
material
was
constitutionally
protected.
this
included
pre-trial
hearings
in
which
evidences
presented
by
the
defendant,
none
by
the
prosecution
and
a
complete
denial
of
any
real
hearing
in
my
opinion,
understanding
by
the
trial
judge
as
to
what
the
issues
were.
since
that
time,
to
give
you
an
example
of
what
occurs
in
the
courts
below
because
of
the
erratic,
if
i
may
say
types
of
decisions
which
emanate
from
the
higher
courts
and
perhaps,
the
visceral
reactions
that
occur
with
various
judges
is.
i’ve
been
in
three
trials
since
i’ve
seen
it
and
this
court
in
wiener
versus
california
held
certain
material
to
be
protected
vis-à-vis
redrup.
now,
the
wiener
materials
were
down
in
san
diego
and
they
involve
some
motion
pictures
and
some
films.
so,
we
--
i
had
two
trials
in
los
angeles
in
which
i
attempted
to
have
the
judge
take
some
recognition
of
the
materials
in
wiener,
so
that
there
could
be
a
comparison
of
what
was
protected
and
what
was
not
protected.
now,
the
interesting
proposition
is
that
the
prosecution
--
mr.
burton
marks
no,
we
waive
jury.
the
interesting
proposition
in
the
first
trial
that
i
had
was
that
the
prosecution
had
an
attorney
who
was
reasonably
experienced
in
the
pornography
field.
this
prosecutor
was
unwilling
to
admit
to
the
court
as
were
the
police
officers
who
were
are
really
the
experts
because
in
los
angeles
they
a
vice
squad
with
pornography
experts
that
travel
through
and
the
state
and
they
know
what’s
going
on.
the
state
refused
to
admit
that
the
materials
in
my
case
were
the
same
as
the
materials
in
wiener.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
refused
to
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
they
were
the
same
and
there
was
simply
no
way
to
get
the
wiener
materials
from
san
diego
to
los
angeles
because
they
had
been
introduced
into
another
case
in
san
diego
to
try
and
persuade
the
second
judge
that
the
materials
were
the
same
and
therefore
protected.
mr.
burton
marks
in
the
--
in
the
last,
well,
the
first
case
i
did
because
the
judge
that
we
finally
got
was,
in
my
opinion,
sophisticated
enough
to
understand
what
was
going
on.
mr.
burton
marks
no.
absolutely
not.
no,
the
--
because
if
you’re
allowed
to
have
the
procedures
which
the
california
state
allows
you
to
have,
you
have
--
you
should
have
under
noroff
a
real
pre-trial
hearing
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
material
is
obscene.
mr.
burton
marks
which
would
end
the
case
but
the
unfortunate
proposition
is,
as
i
was
going
to
point
out
is
that
the
judges
simply
don’t
follow
the
law.
they
don’t
--
perhaps,
it’s
merely
a
matter
of
buck-passing
and
as
former
president
trumann
said,
the
bucks
got
some
--
mr.
burton
marks
well,
that’s
a
very
interesting
--
of
course
not.
of
course
that
--
mr.
burton
marks
of
course.
mr.
burton
marks
sometimes
what
the
judges
feel
or
believe
is
and
there’s
some
california
case
law
to
that
effect.
although
it
really
does
not
seem
to
be
appropriate
because
ordinarily,
we’re
talking
about
a
misdemeanor
case
in
obscenity.
the
only
time
you
get
into
a
felony
case
is
when
it
is
bootstrapped
into
a
felony
by
virtue
of
the
charge
of
conspiracy
which
makes
it
a
felony
or
because
a
person
has
a
second
offense.
now,
if
you
have
a
misdemeanor
trial,
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
preliminary
hearing.
there
--
so,
the
california
supreme
court
gave
misdemeanants
in
a
pornography
case
essentially
what
might
be
called
a
preliminary
hearing
through
the
noroff
case
in
which
you
are
entitled
to
have
a
hearing
to
determine
whether
there’s
obscenity.
now,
some
judges
believe
that
this
only
means
probable
cause.
mr.
burton
marks
yes.
some
judges
believe
that
this
obscenity
issue
in
determination
means
only
probable
cause
to
believe
that’s
obscene,
so
it
will
grow
in
front
of
a
jury,
that
is
not
my
understanding
of
the
law
but
there’s
no
clear-cut
decision
on
that
proposition.
in
a
felony
case,
if
you
happen
to
have
a
felony,
then
you
have
a
preliminary
hearing
and
in
that
preliminary
hearing,
there
is
a
probable
cause
situation
to
believe
that
a
crime
has
been
committed.
again,
there
is
a
case
out
of
california
called
luros
which
says
that
the
grand
jury
does
not
need
any
evidence
to
make
a
determination
of
probable
cause,
so
that
the
matter
can
be
brought
before
the
petit
jury
for
a
trial.
but
then
we
have
again
this
intermediate
noroff
step
which
supposedly
is
suppose
to
have
the
judge
independently
make
a
determination
of
obscenity.
it’s
always
been
my
expression
or
opinion
that
the
proof
of
the
prosecution
as
to
obscenity
in
a
pretrial
hearing
has
to
be
also
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
because
if
it’s
not
obscene,
it
can’t
be
prosecuted.
but,
as
i
say,
this
leaves
the
law
in
the
state
of
flux
and
nobody
really
seems
to
care.
i
was
talking
about
the
trials
that
i
had.
but
what
happened
was
the
wiener,
the
two
defendants
had
been
arrested
in
a
practically
the
same
situation.
they
were
the
type
of
defendant
that
you
will
ordinarily
find
and
as
far
as
i
can
determine,
90
to
95%
of
the
cases
which
come
before
this
court
or
before
any
obscenity
court,
i.e.
a
book
seller,
a
motion
picture
operator,
somebody
who
is
in
business,
not
the
skulking
pornographer
who
goes
out
into
the
alleys
and
calls
in
the
little
kids
and
says,
“look
at
the
dirty
pictures.”
he’s
there,
he
has
a
store,
he
has
a
business,
he
has
a
movie
theater,
he
invites
no
one
in
except
by
the
advertisement.
generally,
if
you
take
a
look,
for
instance,
you
open
your
washington
dc
newspapers
and
there’s
advertising
for
what’s
known
as
adult
films
and
it
doesn’t
pictorially
describe
what’s
being
shown.
it
gives
the
title
and
the
persons
who
are
the,
to
say
the
aficionados
or
the
--
who
want
to
go
to
the
theatres,
know
what’s
going
to
be
shown
on
the
theatres
by
the
fact
of
the
title
and
the
place
where
the
theater
is
and
they
go
and
see
it.
but
i’m
talking
about
the
client,
the
person
who
is
in
business,
he’s
operating
a
store,
he
buys
film,
he
buys
books
and
he
sells
it
to
the
persons
who
come
in.
ordinarily,
there’s
no
such
thing
as
pandering
as
was
described
in
ginsberg.
simply,
a
police
officer
walks
in,
sees
a
piece
of
material
that
he
doesn’t
think
is
a
worthy
of
his
consideration,
either
makes
an
arrest
on
the
spot,
although
that
is
now
out
in
california
but
generally,
will
go
back
and
make
an
affidavit
that
he
saw
a
dirty
book
or
a
dirty
picture
and
he
will
describe
why
it
was
dirty
and
then
some
magistrate
will
sign
a
search
warrant
and
they’ll
go
in
and
seize
that.
sometime,--
mr.
burton
marks
sometimes,
they
do
but
very
seldom.
apparently,
there
is
not
enough
funds
given
to
the
vice
squad
to
purchase
this
type
of
material.
they
have
other
areas.
they
generally
go
in
and
they
look
at
the
pictures.
my
two
clients
happen
to
have
arcades
on
main
street
where
you
have
peep
shows
and
little
motion
pictures
theatres.
police
officers
went
in,
saw
the
films,
went
back,
described
what
they
saw
or
what
they
thought
they
saw,
gave
the
affidavit
to
a
magistrate,
authorize
the
seizure,
they
came
back
a
few
days
later,
seized
the
film,
took
it
to
the
police
station
then
had
an
arrest
warrant
issued.
both
clients
were
charged
with
felonies
because
they
were,
had
a
prior
misdemeanor.
mr.
burton
marks
evidence.
in
the
first
case,
the
judge,
after
i’d
waived
jury
and
after
i’d
been
able
to
present
an
expert
who
had
seen
the
wiener
material
and
seen
this
material
which
was
called
simulated,
testified
it
was
exactly
the
same
and
i
presented
to
the
judge
a
list
of
cases
that
--
and
showed
him
how
the
material
was
exactly
the
same.
he
finally
read
the
material
and
lo
and
behold
after
an
entire
trial
in
which
the
police
officer
testified
in
their
expertise
as
to
what
was
obscene
and
not
obscene
and
my
expert
had
shown
the
comparison
between
wiener
material
and
these
materials,
the
judge
granted
my
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
grounds
that
the
material
was
constitutionally
protected
and
returned
the
films
to
me.
the
next
case
was
exactly
the
same.
it
was
another
person
at
an
arcade
next
door.
i
went
into
the
second
judge
who
had
never
had
a
pornography
case,
never
had
an
obscenity
case
but
of
course
knew
what
was
obscene
and
not
obscene,
tried
to
persuade
him
that
this
case
that
i
had
today
was
exactly
the
same
case
as
the
case
i
had
yesterday
and
that
in
fact
the
ruling
of
the
judge
before
was
res
judicata
because
it
wasn’t
an
acquittal.
it
was
declaration
of
protected
material.
the
second
judge
--
mr.
burton
marks
well,
it
would
at
least
be
collateral
estoppel
under
ashe
versus
swenson
because
the
prosecution
has
to
be
stopped
from
continuing
to
prosecute
something
which
they
must
know
is
protected.
it
was
the
same
district
attorney’s
office.
mr.
burton
marks
no,
no,
a
different
defendant
but
the
same
material.
now,
somewhere
along
the
line,
if
the
defendant
or
a
person
in
a
criminal
case
who
was
charged
with
a
criminal
offense
is
--
must
have
the
opportunity
of
saying,
“look,
i
am
protected.”
isn’t
that
what
scienter
means?
doesn’t
scienter
mean
that
the
person
is
doing
something
which
he
thinks
is
alright
or
conversely
if
you
want
to
prove
that
he
had
mens
rea
of
the
offense,
he
had
to
know
or
at
least
have
reason
to
believe
that
the
material
which
he
was
selling
or
exhibiting
or
purveying
was
not
protected
or
in
the
realm
of
hardcore
pornography.
but
these
booksellers
don’t
know
that
because
they
get
a
decision
from
redrup,
a
protected
material
and
then
down
it
comes
to
the
lowest
court
and
sometimes
even
the
highest
court
and
they
say,
we
don’t
believe
it.
nobody
could
hold
anything
like
that
to
be
protected.
mr.
burton
marks
no,
there
is
--
the
aspects
of
it
blowing
in
the
wind
but
it’s
not
legislative.
it
would
be
judicial
because
of
some
recent
decisions
that
came
out
of
the
district
court,
three-judge
courts
and
the
central
district
of
california
stating
that
perhaps
the
search
and
seizure
statutes
which
we
have
and
the
1538.5
of
the
penal
code
which
allows
for
a
traverse
to
a
search
warrant.
although
it
doesn’t
meet
the
freedman
requirements
of
the
blount
versus
rizzi
requirements
of
a
fast
hearing
provided
by
the
state.
at
least,
one
court
has
said,
that’s
sufficient
hearing
and
you
can
probably
traverse
the
search
warrant
on
the
basis
that
the
material
was
not
in
fact
obscene
and
couldn’t
be
seized
because
that’s
the
law
in
the
state
of
california.
also,
if
it’s
protected,
it
can’t
be
seized
but
the
big
problem
is
how
do
you
get
word
to
the
judge
that
it’s
protected?
mr.
burton
marks
it
ought
to
be.
but
what
happens
is
that
the
judge
will
say
as
he
did
in
the
second
case.
first
of
all,
i
don’t
--
these
aren’t
exactly
the
same
materials,
so
therefore
they
must
be
different
and
you
can
argue
all
day
long
that
that
one
portrayal
of
an
active
sexual
intercourse
is
very
much
like
another
act
of
sexual
intercourse.
mr.
burton
marks
i’m
talking
about
two
films
that
if
you
put
them
back-to-back
and
took
away
the
faces
of
the
actors,
it
would
be
impossible
to
describe
any
difference
in
what
was
portrayed
on
the
screen.
mr.
burton
marks
right.
some
of
them
may
have
different
titles
but
there
just
is
no
way,
i
recall
the
old
saying,
you’ve
seen
one,
you’ve
seen
them
both.
you’ve
seen
--
mr.
burton
marks
well,
it’s
got
to
help
somebody.
mr.
burton
marks
well,
that
i
guess
is
the
big
problem.
because
if
i
see
a
magazine
that
shows
a
picture
of
a
naked
woman
with
her
legs
spread
but
is
known
in
the
trade
as
a
beaver
shot
and
this
court
has
said,
“that’s
protected.”
and
i
see
another
magazine
with
a
woman
with
her
legs
spread
and
a
beaver
shot
with
a
different
title
and
a
different
woman,
i
would
like
to
be
able
to
tell
my
client,
it’s
alright
to
sell
that
because
it’s
been
held
protected
but
some
courts
will
say,
“well,
that’s
ridiculous.
it’s
a
different
woman
and
it’s
a
different
camera
angle
and
it’s
a
different
magazine,
so
how
could
the
material
be
protected?”
one
of
the
most
beautiful
cases
in
point
and
it
was
handed
to
me
by
my
brother
mr.
cello
who
will
be
arguing
later
as
a
case
of
wisconsin
versus
simpson
out
of
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
filed
october
31,
1972
and
in
that
case,
they
had,
from
what
i
can
determine,
magazines
with
nude
persons
together
and
nothing
more
and
here
is
some
of
the
holdings
of
the
wisconsin
supreme
court.
incidentally,
i
had
brought
it
along
and
now
i
don’t
seem
to
be
able
to
find
it
in
the
recent
article,
the
most
recent
edition
of
the
new
york
magazine.
there’s
a
little
cartoon
that
shows
two
gentlemen
in
black
robes
strolling
along
and
one
of
them
is
saying,
“if
it
turns
me
on,
it’s
smut.”
so,
that’s
about
what
happened
with
the
wisconsin
supreme
court.
here’s
what
they
say,
described
magazines
are
not,
as
a
matter
of
law,
not
obscene.
this
was
the
contention
raised.
appellant
argues
that
these
magazines
cannot
be
found
obscene
because
only
nudity
is
depicted
and
not
sexual
activity.
given
non-obscenity
for
non-sexuality
are
just
--
argues
appellant,
these
complaints
are
not
sufficient
because
they
do
not
allege
obscene
depictions
of
sexual
activity.
supportive
of
this
proposition,
appellants
asserts
several
redrup
reversals.
and
certain
language
in
state
versus
amato
they
go
down.
this
court,
in
court
versus
state
resoundingly
rejected
the
contention
therein
presented
that
this
court
is
bound
by
the
decisions
in
other
courts
regarding
whether
similar
magazines
are
obscene
or
not.
and
he
puts
in
quotes,
“the
subjective
nature
of
the
material
as
well
as
the
subjective
conduct
of
the
respective
defendant
requires
an
individual
analysis
in
each
case.”
a
complete
rejection
by
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
of
what
this
court
said
in
redrup
that
certain
material
is
protected.
they
say,
“we’ll
tell
you
whether
or
not
it’s
protected.
we’ll
tell
you
whether
or
not
we
viscerally
have
that
feeling.”
another
example,
of
the
type
of
reaction
you
get
from
the
lower
courts,
the
question
is,
was
the
introduction
of
the
magazines
in
the
evidence
without
further
evidence
sufficient
to
prove
their
obscenity
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt?
and
they
say,
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
obscenity
is
not
so
illusive.
the
concept
is
to
require
expert
testimony.
there’s
nothing
here
that
warrants
any
further
consideration
of
that
question
and
the
evidence
in
the
form
of
the
magazines
themselves
was
clearly
sufficient
to
prove
obscenity
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
you
know
how
this
case
went
to
trial
?they
took
the
magazines
and
threw
them
into
the
jury
and
said,
“this
is
what
the
man
is
selling.”
and
remember
these
are
magazines
of
a
man
and
a
woman
in
nude
and
that’s
all
they’re
doing
and
the
court
is
saying,
“we
will
ignore
everything
and
we’re
going
to
go
our
own
way.”
what
do
you
do?
well
--
mr.
burton
marks
absolutely,
assuming
that
you
can
find
some
judges
in
the
district
courts,
the
federal
district
courts
that
will
follow
the
law
of
this
court
because
you
don’t
always
follow
that
either.
i
was
continuing
my
saga
for
which
this
court
is
very
familiar
with
a
case
where
there
were
20,000
rolls
of
films
seized
in
southern
california
and
the
district
courts
held
they
couldn’t
be
seized,
it
was
unlawful
and
judge
hanson
of
the
superior
court
said,
who
i
knew
in
effect
and
it
went
to
the
court
of
appeal.
judge
hanson
was
never
held
in
contempt,
of
course,
because
judges
are
immune
from
that
sort
of
thing
and
it
went
through
three
or
four
or
five
respective
courts,
finally
came
up
to
this
court
which
affirmed
the
district
court
three-judge
ruling
and
finally,
when
the
films
got
back
after
five
or
six
months
of
the
most
extraordinary
waste
of
time,
in
my
opinion.
getting
back
to
the
initial
premise
of
my
argument,
can’t
we
give
a
defendant
in
a
pornography
case
the
same
due
process
of
law
that
you
give
with
a
juvenile
or
that
you
give
a
parolee?
can’t
he
have
a
hearing
such
as
you
said
in
morrissey?
can’t
he
have
the
same
presumption
of
innocence
that
is
to
say
in
winship?
you
said
due
process
says
that
each
element
of
the
offense
must
be
proved
by
competent
evidence
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
well,
we
have
three
elements
of
the
offense.
we
actually
have
four.
they
were
stated
in
this
court
in
roth.
they
were
stated
in
memoirs
and
it
was
just
recently
approved
by
this
court
in
rabe
versus
washington
which
approved
roth
and
memoirs
as
to
the
three
elements.
the
three
elements
are
very
simple.
does
it
go
beyond
contemporary
standards
as
appeal
to
the
prurient
interest?
is
it
utterly
without
socially
redeeming
value?
doesn’t
the
prosecution
have
the
burden
of
proving
those
elements,
first
amendment
elements
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
so
that
defendant
can
have
a
hearing
and
a
trial
on
it
and
don’t
they
have
to
present
evidence,
competent
evidence?
i
say
that
due
process
as
they
do.
the
fourth
element
is
even
more
illusive
and
that’s
the
scienter
element.
smith
versus
california
said
you’ve
got
to
know
what
you’re
doing.
the
basic
element
of
due
process
of
law
is
that
you
have
mens
rea
of
criminal
intent.
this
people
are
businessman.
maybe
they’re
on
a
dirty
business
that
you
don’t
like
but
nevertheless,
they
are
in
business.
they
don’t
want
--
mr.
burton
marks
i
say
that
he
must
know
what’s
in
the
book
is
illegal
or
probably
illegal
because
if
you
just
say,
you
know
what’s
in
the
book,
then
you
get
in
to
the
wild
speculation.
does
that
mean
that
he
knows
that
there’s
some
pictures
of
nude
people?
does
he
know
it’s
sexually
oriented?
the
bible
is
sexually
oriented
if
you
take
some
passages.
what
do
you
have
to
know
about
the
contents
of
the
book?
i
think
you
have
to
know
or
have
some
reason
to
believe
that
he
knows
that
this
has
gone
beyond
what
that
which
is
legally
protected.
mr.
burton
marks
well,
it
goes
a
little
bit
further
but
it
has
to
be
a
logical
and
rational
extension
of
that
scienter
requirement
because
if
you
don’t
have
that
scienter
requirement,
you
might
as
well
overrule
smith
versus
california
and
say
anybody
who
sells
a
book
or
to
show
the
motion
picture
that
deals
with
sex
is
subject
to
arrest
and
prosecution
under
some
standards
which
are
slightly
less
than
the
standards
which
are
afforded
to
most
other
criminals.
i
say,
finally,
there’s
an
instruction
that
used
to
be
given
in
a
series
of
time.
it
says
in
the
federal
courts,
to
the
jury,
“if
he’s
guilty,
say
so.
if
he’s
not
guilty,
say
so.”
i
say
in
this
instance,
if
you’re
going
to
give
us
some
standards,
and
you’re
going
to
say
that
the
first
amendment
applies
to
the
states,
say
so.
and
if
you’re
going
to
tell
that
the
courts
below
that
they
can’t
seize
a
material
without
having
an
adversary
hearing
or
some
sort
of
hearing
afforded
to
the
person,
say
so.
and
if
you’re
going
to
say
that
they
can’t
prosecute
without
having
a
hearing
or
to
some
determination
as
the
material,
say
so.
but
--
mr.
burton
marks
an
injunctive
type
of
proceeding.
mr.
burton
marks
in
--
i
think
that
if
you’re
--
first
of
all,
i
have
never
seen
a
case
since
ginsberg
which
has
that
type
of
pandering.
i
think
that
that
case
is
out
in
that
field
and
will
never
happen
again
but
if
it
does
happen
again,
this
court
has
found
ways
to
get
around
what
have
otherwise
been
apparently
restrictive
rules
of
law.
if
the
person
is
pandering
and
he
knows
it,
the
law
allows
for
it,
there’s
room
for
all
of
those,
that
type
of
exception.
thank
you.
mr.
burton
marks
no,
i
think
what
they
must
be
--
the
only
thing
that
they
can
bind
the
defendant
on
in
a
separate
question
is
scienter.
after
that
hearing,
no
other
defendant
can
go
about
and
say
i
didn’t
know
it
was
protected
because
the
law
presumes
that
everybody
else
knows
the
law.
mr.
burton
marks
oh,
he
can
defend
on
the
ground
that
it’s
not
obscene
because
i
would
say
this,
as
long
as
your
procedure
is
going
along,
you’d
obviously
have
to
have
an
in
rem
proceeding
with
the
right
to
appeal
by
whoever
is
appealing
but
the
question
of
scienter
knowledge
of
as
to
whether
it’s
obscene
would
be
withdraw
because
don’t
forget,
in
a
in
rem
proceeding
you
have
a
judge
sitting
there
and
the
judge
can
rule
on
the
--
i
think
that
the
only
thing
that
judge
can
rule
on
is
whether
or
not
the
book
is
not
obscene.
if
he
rules
that
he
will
not
make
such
a
finding
that
the
book
is
not
obscene
that
it
is
not
protected,
then
notices
given
to
the
world
as
it
were
to
the
criminal
defendants
that
this
may
be
the
subject
of
a
prosecution
because
he
can’t
foreclose
by
saying
that
the
book
is
obscene,
the
right
of
a
criminal
defendant
in
a
case
to
have
a
jury
trial
on
that
issue.
mr.
burton
marks
absolutely
and
that’s
the
way
it
should
be.
thank
you.
mr.
burton
marks
very
briefly,
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i
say
this,
i
may
have
some
disagreement
as
to
whether
probable
cause
hearing
is
different
from
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
hearing
and
i
personally
feel
that
chapman
versus
california
would
not
militate
or
necessitate
a
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
hearing.
but
that’s
not
the
point.
the
point
is,
give
us
a
hearing
and
let
us
work
it
out.
that’s
what
happened
before.
give
us
a
hearing.
let
that
person
have
his
chance
in
court
not
in
a
criminal
prosecution
which
was
never
meant
to
apply
to
a
first
amendment
case.
mr.
burton
marks
give
us
a
hearing
which
will
find
the
states,
so
that
they
can’t
continue
to
harass
and
prosecute
for
the
same
type
of
material.
mr.
burton
marks
no,
the
same
type.
mr.
burton
marks
well,
somebody
knows
it
when
they
see
it
and
you
can
look
at
it
and
there’s
no,
this
is
no
question.
mr.
burton
marks
if
you
are
doing
a
jury
by
jury,
you’re
doing
it
on
a
proposition
that
one
type
of
material
has
already
been
declared
to
be
materially
protected
and
you
can’t
even
bring
that
type
of
evidence
in
some
cases
before
a
jury
or
before
a
judge
to
a
stop.
mr.
burton
marks
oh,
that
has
happened
but
that
is
not
what
i’m
saying.
perhaps,
what
i’m
saying
is
that
the
defendant
has
to
have
a
chance
to
know
before
he
can
be
put
before
the
jury
and
made
to
do
something
and
the
state
should
give
the
opportunity
and
they
should
be
forced
to
produced
the
evidence
by
an
impartial
state,
not
the
police
officer
testifying
as
the
expert
but
impartial
evidence
before
an
impartial
judge.
that’s
what
we
need.
