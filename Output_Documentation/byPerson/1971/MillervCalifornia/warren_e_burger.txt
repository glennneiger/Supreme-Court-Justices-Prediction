chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
is
next
in
number
70-73,
miller
against
california.
mr.
marks,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
in
the
morning,
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that
was
mr.
justice
blackmun
and
i
agreed
with
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
ask
you
about
this
administrative
process
you
were
just
suggesting
to
be
interposed
before
a
criminal
proceeding
starts.
so
you
are
suggesting
something
like
the
old
fashioned
board
of
censorship
to
take
a
look
at
it
first
and
advise
the
publisher?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
suggested
in
your
briefs
that
you
have
filed
with
this
that
you
have
laid
down
this
standard
that
you
want
us
to
adopt,
that
will
solve
all
the
problems.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
marks.
mr.
capizzi?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
didn't
you
say
it
was
on
demurrer,
or
was
that
another
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
has
california
at
any
time
undertaken
to
use
nuisance
statutes
or
local
nuisance
ordinances
to
deal
with
pornography
and
obscenity?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
any
reason
why
california
is
limited
to
using
its
nuisance
procedures
against
what
you
call
live
or
live
obscenity
or
obscenity
which
is
essentially
conduct,
would
it
be
available,
in
other
words,
to
use
it
against
books
or
moving
pictures?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
a
standard
would
become
outdated
and
therefore
not
contemporary
after
the
lapse
of
two
or
three
years,
is
that
what
you
think
contemporary
is?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
the
difference
between
saying
that
we
aren't
bound
by
the
standards
of
1791
and
saying
that
the
standard
is
outdated
if
it's
based
on
some
sort
of
a
survey,
made
in
1965.
i
get
it
that
you're
suggesting
that
this
just
have
to
be
kept
up-to-date
almost
on
a
month-by-month
basis,
to
see
what
people
are
thinking
just
lately.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
you
set
out
an
impossible
task
for
yourself,
haven't
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
let
me
ask
you,
you
urged
the
orange,
the
local
standard
--
would
you
say
the
--
law
practices
by
saying
let's
assume
that
the
first
amendment
applies
to
the
states
of
the
same
--
to
all
the
states
the
same
way?
would
you
say
that
if
california
can
use
a
local
standard
that
there
are
no
limits
to
what
might
be
held
to
exceed
the
standards
of
candor
in
the
community?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
capizzi.
mr.
marks,
i
think
you
have
consumed
your
time,
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
hear
arguments
first
today
in
number
70-73,
miller
against
california.
mr.
marks.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
an
in
rem
determination
with
respect
to
the
one
would
not
really
help
you
very
much,
would
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
unless
it’s
a
copy
of
the
precisely
the
same
film,
you
wouldn’t
have
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
as
much
as
i
recall
it,
correct
me
if
i’m
wrong,
you
urged
us
on
a
prior
argument
too
that
younger
against
harris
was
wrong
and
that
we
should
overrule
it,
you
maintain
that
point
or
did
i
--?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
capizzi.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
distinguish
between
the
probable
cause
standard
and
a
civil
preponderance
of
the
evidence
standard?
are
they
different
in
california?
isn’t
that
the
very
nature
of
probable
cause
or
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
a
balance
of
the
probabilities
and
how
is
that
different
from
a
probable
cause
test?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
both
fall
short
of
the
standard
of
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt,
don’t
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
going
back
to
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
question
to
you
about
the
jury
acting
independently,
isn’t
the
jury
permitted
to
credit
or
discredit
any
evidence
that
it
wants
to?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
particularly,
isn’t
that
true
about
expert
testimony?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
has
the
california
supreme
court
undertaken
to
define
statewide
standards
of
what
constitutes
negligence
or
reasonable
care?
or
do
they
leave
that
to
juries
on
a
case
by
case
basis?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
be
fair
to
say
that
it’s
possible
to
have
one
type
of
a
verdict
in
northern
california
in
a
homicide
case
and
a
different
type
of
verdict
substantially
the
same
evidence
in
some
other
part
of
california?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that’s
the
nature
of
the
jury
system,
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
capizzi.
mr.
marks,
do
you
have
anything
further?
you
have
two
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
who’s
going
to
decide
whether
it’s
the
same
type?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn’t
that
what
you’re
doing
now,
jury
by
jury?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
are
you
saying
any
more
then
than
that
in
some
courts
before
some
juries,
a
verdict
might
manslaughter
and
that
on
the
same
evidence
might
be
second-degree
murder?
is
that
--
i
take
it
as
a
lawyer
you’ve
acknowledged
that
that
does
happen?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
