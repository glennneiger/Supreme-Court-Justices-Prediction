mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
initially
i
would
like
to
attempt
to
set
the
records
straight
in
this
matter
and
in
the
april
of
1969,
a
complaint
was
filed
in
the
municipal
court
of
the
harbor
judicial
district
for
orange
county.
thereafter
on
april
16th,
1969
the
demurrer
was
filed
by
mr.
marks,
the
defendant
of
that
action.
thereafter,
an
amended
complaint
was
filed
may
9th,
1969
and
following
the
amended
complaint
the
same
demurrer
was
held
to
apply
to
the
amended
complaint.
the
hearing
and
the
demurrer,
under
california
law
is
limited
to
face
the
complaint.
however,
mr.
marks
did
introduce
expert
testimony
at
that
time,
expert
testimony
related
to
the
obscenity
of
the
material
in
question.
that
was
not
controverted
by
the
prosecution
simply
because
on
demurrer,
no
evidence
can
be
taken,
the
inquiry
is
limited
to
the
face
of
the
complaint.
thereafter
there
was
an
appeal
to
the
appellate
department
in
the
superior
court
in
orange
county,
and
the
denial
of
demurrer
was
sustained.
now
this
record
--
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
i
understand
that
to
be
one
of
his
contentions
mr.
justice
douglas.
however,
i
think
he
is
also
--
maybe
contention
that
action
in
the
joining
county
constituted
res
judicata.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
i
tend
to
disagree
with
him.
i
think
depending
on
how
the
standard,
was
a
definition
announced
by
this
court
is
interpreted,
it
is
workable.
i
think
the
procedural
aspects
and
there
must
be
a
clarification.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
well,
california
has
gone
one
step
beyond
roth
and
has
adopted
a
position
that
is
not
(inaudible)
by
majority
of
this
court
as
being
constitutionally
required,
and
that
the
california
statue
requires
that
the
prosecution
established
that
the
material
goes
substantially
beyond
customary
limits
of
candor
that
it
predominantly
appealed
to
prurient
interest
and
the
material
considered
as
a
whole,
utterly
without
revealing
social
importance.
so
by
statue
in
california,
all
three
elements
must
be
established
by
the
prosecution
and
must
correlate.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
well,
it
adopts
the
definition
of
obscenity
as
first
they
founded
in
roth
and
then
later
expanded
upon
i
believe
in
memoirs,
utterly
without
redeeming
social
importance
aspect.
we
don't
think
a
majority
of
the
court
concurred
in
that
requirement
but
nevertheless
california
by
a
legislative
act
has
added
that
third
requirement.
that
is
why
there
were
experts
produced
by
the
people
on
all
three
of
those
elements
definition
and
the
jury
was
instructed
as
to
all
three
and
instructed
that
they
must
pull
it
up.
nevertheless
counsel
points
to
the
action
that
took
place
in
los
angles
county
and
with
respect
to
that
action
in
the
opinion
of
the
los
angles
county
municipal
court
judge,
that
was
never
directly
pointed
out
to
the
judge
in
which
the
action
was
pending,
the
instant
action
was
pending
for
trial.
it's
part
of
the
record,
the
clerk's
transcript
in
this
appeal,
simply
because
it
was
not
exhibit
to
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
prohibition
that
was
filed
in
our
superior
court,
attempting
to
prohibit
the
misdemeanor
prosecution.
in
filing
that
petition
for
prohibition
with
our
superior
court,
he
apparently
lodged
a
courtesy
copy
with
the
municipal
court
and
that
is
how
it
became
a
part
of
our
record.
then,
thereafter
just
prior
to
the
trial,
he
did
make
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
basis
of
res
judicata,
but
no
evidence
was
presented
and
there
was
no
hearing
on
that
particular
motion
and
in
particular,
the
opinion
was
not
a
part
of
that
particular
motion.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
that
was
a
dismissal
on
a
preliminary
motion
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
it
did
not
go
to
trial,
it
was
what
is
known
in
california,
a
motion,
a
determination
of
the
question
of
law.
the
mixed
question
of
constitutional
fact
and
law.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
in
los
angles
county,
i
believe
it
was
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
demurrer
based
on
two
cases,
people
versus
(inaudible)
as
i
recall.
now,
the
appellent
contends
that
this
court
or
at
least
the
members
of
this
court
had
in
the
past
suggested
and
this
court
should
continue
to
conduct
de
novo
hearings
to
determine
obscenity
going
on.
and
further
suggests
that
in
reaching
that
determination
of
constitutional
fact,
that
makes
question
of
fact
and
law,
the
judge
when
applying
contemporary
standards
for
customary
limits
of
candor
should
adopt
a
national
community
standard.
what
appellant
requests
maybe
easier
for
this
court
than
for
other
courts
because
the
scope
of
this
court's
judicial
inquiry
is
nationwide,
or
suggest
even
for
this
court,
it's
not
an
easy
task
and
is,
in
fact,
an
impossible
task.
appellant
also
suggests
that
each
judge
from
the
trial
level
through
each
level
of
review
should
redetermine
the
issue,
de
novo
using
the
same
test,
the
national
test.
and
i
would
submit
that
this
is
practically
impossible,
local
trial,
appellate
and
state
supreme
justice,
they
just
don't
have
the
sufficient
scope
of
judicial
inquiry
to
apply
a
national
standard
with
respect
to
their
contact
with
national
standards
for
customary
limits
of
candor,
i
would
suggest
that
it
is
no
more
broad
than
the
average
potential
juror.
i
think
the
case
which
counsel
has
just
called
this
court's
attention
to
this
morning
with
their
circuit
case,
demonstrates
that
when
judge
thornsbury
indicates
that
he
is
not
sufficiently
qualified
to
determine
customary
limits
of
candor.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
yes
mr.
justice
douglas.
in
fact,
mr.
marks
has
suggested
experts,
but
i
think
that
demonstrates
another
problem
that
we'll
further
confound
the
problems
that
are
already
existing.
experts
maybe
fine
for
the
initial
judge,
the
trial
judge,
who
can
examine
the
witness,
determine
his
credibility,
watch
the
demeanor
while
he's
testifying
and
all
the
things
that
a
triar
of
fact
generally
does,
but
what
position
does
that
leave
the
appellate
judge,
the
reviewing
judge
in?
if
there
are
conflicting
experts,
how
does
he
determine
credibility
of
the
varying
witnesses?
it's
totally
impossible
to
say
that
the
reviewing
judge
would
determine
credibility,
would
be
a
substantial
departure
from
the
(inaudible)
rules
of
the
appellate
review.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
i
don't
think
it's
that
difficult
for
a
publisher
to
know
when
he's
crossed
the
line.
in
fact,
the
reporter's
transcript
in
this
particular
case,
in
this
volume
2
around
page
50,
give
or
take
a
few
pages,
indicates
that
mr.
miller
indicated
to
the
person
who
was
sending
the
material
out
that
the
brochures
themselves
he
felt
were
borderline,
but
the
material
itself
that
they
were
advertising,
he
considered
to
be
pornographic.
the
brochures
are
nothing
but
the
more
graphic
depictions
of
sexual
activity
that
are
contained
in
what
he
himself
described
as
pornography.
well,
i
think
--
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
no,
it
wasn't
your
honor.
it
was
a
trial,
the
statement
made
by
mr.
miller
came
in
by
way
of
one
of
the
persons
who
was
stopping
the
envelopes
and
perisisting
in
the
distribution.
i
would
suggest,
however,
that
if
we
do
apply
the
approach
in
the
instant
case
that
each
level
of
court
must
determine
a
constitutional
fact
law
question
that
it's
readily
apparent
that
in
this
case,
as
far
as
that
constitutional
fact
is
concerned,
that
this
material
is
obscene,
no
matter
what
test
is
used,
whether
we
use
a
local,
state
or
national
community.
it
exceeds
candor
of
any
community.
it
predominantly
appeals
to
the
prurient
interest,
and
is
utterly
without
redeeming
social
importance,
the
california
test.
having
concluded
that
it's
not
constitutionally
protective,
it
submitted
that
this
material
should
fall
into
the
same
category
as
any
other
conduct
that
a
state
can
regulate
by
its
police
power,
any
other
conduct
which
is
not
itself
constitutionally
protected
and
the
states
in
regulating
that
other
non-constitutional
conduct
can
define
it
in
any
manner
they
wish.
the
state's
vary
in
the
definition
of
robbery
from
state
to
state,
perjury
varies
from
state
to
state,
and
assuming
this
initial
constitutional
fact
law,
determinations
made
by
judge
is
determined
that
it's
not
constitutionally
protected
then
the
state
should
be
free
to
adopt
whatever
standard
they
wish
just
as
they
do
in
other
areas
of
criminal
law.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
yes,
your
honor.
in
the
county
of
orange,
we've
utilized
what's
known
as
a
red
light
abatement
act
to
abate
as
a
public
nuisance,
places
that
are
used
for
loot
purposes,
prostitution
and
assignation,
more
often
in
the
area
of
live
entertainment,
in
the
area
of
printed
material.
but
submit
however,
that
it's
not
necessary
to
do
as
appellant
suggests
to
determine
this
constitutional
fact
in
this
manner,
when
looking
at
a
state
prosecution
under
state
law.
the
constitution
permits
the
states
to
adopt
the
standard
that
state
chooses
as
long
as
the
standard
is
compatible
with
due
process
in
isolating
obscenity
as
justice
harlan
said
the
state
by
the
due
process
liberty
provision
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
has
not
held
the
same
test
as
has
the
federal
government
under
the
first
amendment.
as
justice
harlan
indicated,
that's
readily
apparent
from
the
language
of
the
two
amendments
themselves,
the
first
provides
congress
shall
make
no
law
and
obviously,
we
can't
apply
that
in
its
precise
terms
through
the
state
through
the
fourth
amendment
because
congress
doesn't
exist
in
this
state.
so
obviously,
we
have
to
do
some
initial
editing.
additionally,
it's
rather
obvious
that
if
in
enacting
the
fourteenth
amendment,
it
was
the
intent
to
restrict
the
state
as
the
first
restricts
congress,
it
would
have
been
very
simple
and
to
have
so
stated
that
the
states
are
prohibited
from
enacting
any
law
abridging
the
freedom
of
speech.
i
would
certainly
not
suggest
that
those
persons
who
framed
the
fourteenth
amendment
were
so
imprecise
and
so
inarticulate,
that
if
that
had
been
their
intent
with
the
background
of
the
first
amendment,
that
something
consistent
with
the
first
amendment
could
have
been
specifically
provided
to
the
states.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
we
haven't
progressed
in
our
cases
that
are
pending
against
a
particular
bookstore
to
the
point
where
we
have
applied
it.
there
have
been
acts
of
mootness
as
well
as
the
sale
and
distribution
of
books
from
that
particular
bookstore
that
have
gone
inside
the
premises.
the
act
itself
states
that
it
applies
to
places
of
prostitution,
assignation
or
lewdness.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
yes,
your
honor,
in
its
expressed
terms
i
feel
that
--
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
i
would
suggest
that
the
--
again
the
decision
taken
by
mr.
justice
harlan
and
expressed
by
him
in
the
roth
case
is
entirely
reasonable
and
it's
consistent
with
the
constitution.
when
we're
talking
about
the
deprivation
of
one
of
the
fundamental
liberties
without
due
process
of
law.
the
inquiry
should
be
whether
or
not
the
state
action
so
subverts
the
fundamental
liberties
implicit
in
the
due
process
clause
that
it
cannot
be
sustained
as
a
rational
exercise
of
power
and
i
would
submit
that
adoption
by
state
of
a
local
or
statewide
standards
for
limits
of
candor
as
a
portion
of
the
definition
of
obscenity
is
not
subversive
of
fundamental
liberties,
but
is
actually
a
rational
exercise
of
power,
whether
--
i
would
suggest
that
neither
practicality,
reason
or
the
constitution
require
a
national
standard
for
customary
limits
of
candor
as
suggested
by
the
appellant.
initially,
i
would
suggest
that
practicality
demands
that
something
other
than
a
national
standard
be
used.
how
is
a
national
standard
to
be
determined
fully
apart
from
the
legal
question,
the
mixed
question
of
constitutional
fact
law,
as
a
matter
of
fact
presented
to
the
jury,
how
is
a
national
standard
to
be
determined.
well,
as
far
as
that
factual
determination,
i
would
assume
that
experts
could
testify,
however
in
this
case,
an
expert
testified
as
to
the
statewide
standard,
an
expert
who
is
employee
of
the
los
angeles
police
department,
took
him
30
days
to
conduct
his
survey
analysis
of
the
state
and
five
years
on
the
job.
say,
if
los
angeles
now
charges
$400
a
day,
every
time
another
experts
goes
outside
the
city
limits
to
testify
to
recoup
the
cost
of
conducting
their
survey
and
updating
their
survey.
can
you
imagine
the
additional
cost
that
would
be
involved
that
that
expert
had
to
spend
30
days
traveling
each
of
the
50
states,
why
we're
taking
50
months
just
to
complete
a
survey?
long
before
he
completed
the
survey,
he
would
have
to
update
it
because
it
requires
contemporary
community
standard.
so
if
we
multiply
the
cost
by
50
times
400
and
a
time,
50
times
a
month,
totally
impossible
and
impractical.
now
i'm
not
suggesting
that
cost
to
loan
is
a
factor
that
should
cause
us
to
overlook
any
constitutional
rights.
i'm
simply
suggesting
constitution
itself
does
not
require
experts
and
it's
impractical,
impractical
to
prove
through
experts
a
national
standard.
reason
also
requires
that
a
local
standard,
local
state
standard
be
adapted.
obviously,
one
local
area
will
accept
material
that
another
local
area
will
not.
a
national
standard
who
very
likely
prevents
a
local
community
that
had
liberal
attitude
and
would
accept
material.
from
receiving
that
material,
because
of
the
restrict
of
influence
of
a
conservative
community
some
2500
miles
away.
and
the
opposite
is
also
true.
the
conservative
community
would
be
forced
to
accept
material
because
of
a
nationwide
standard
that
is
diluted
by
a
more
liberal
standard
of
a
community
again,
2500
miles
away.
thus
adoption
of
a
national
standard
would
have
just
the
effect
that
the
appellant
in
this
case
and
in
the
amici
are
suggesting
as
undesirable.
it
would
have
the
result
of
making
this
all
one,
making
this
all
little
thin
soldiers
out
of
a
mold,
all
receiving
the
same
material,
the
same
standard
and
would
not
provide
for
differences
from
one
community
to
another.
we
suggest
additionally
that
the
constitution
supports
a
state
or
local
community
standard.
initially
in
roth,
this
court
used
the
term
community
and
inspite
of
the
dictionary
definition,
that's
in
the
footnote
2
to
jacobellis
suggest
that
the
customary
meaning
of
the
community
is
a
local
community,
the
area
in
which
people
shop,
work,
live
and
entertain
themselves.
i
think
that
definition
of
community
is
also
consistent
with
the
same
paragraph
of
the
dictionary
referred
to
in
that
footnote
of
jacobellis
which
defines
community
as
society
as
a
whole.
additionally,
it's
constitutionally
permissible
to
accept
that
local
or
statewide
standard
because
of
the
definition
announced
in
roth,
that
the
community
standard
must
be
contemporary
with
the
times,
without
that
term
contemporary
we
would
be
stuck,
i
would
assume
with
the
same
definition
of
obscenity
that
existed
in
1791
when
the
first
amendment
was
adopted.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
i
think
it
must
be
a
standard,
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
related
at
the
same
time
as
the
distribution
or
the
time
of
the
crime,
i
think
it
has
to
exist
in
tune
with
our
particular
times.
it's
not
a
community
standard
that
existed
in
say
1850
or
1791
because
of
the
term
contemporary.
we
have
--
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
i
think
that
is
true
mr.
chief
justice
that
--
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
i
think
it's
a
task
that
has
been
reported
almost
by
the
term
contemporary
and
the
california
supreme
court
in
a
case
of
in
re
giannini
requiring
that
community
standards
be
established
by
experts.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
yes
sir,
mr.
justice
douglas,
however.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
no,
in
this
case
we
are
not
dealing
with
double
dating.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
well,
the
same
marked
definition
of
obscene
was
applied
to
the
topless
dancing
in
in
re
giannini
as
it's
applied
to
printed
matter
in
california
because
of
the
california
supreme
court
statement
that
the
dancing
is
an
expressive
conduct.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
well,
i'm
suggesting
--
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
i
submit
that
the
constitution
permits
a
changing
standard
based
on
geographical
lines,
even
if
the
material
is
distributed
nationwide.
now
in
this
case,
we
have
no
evidence
that
the
material
was
distributed
nationwide.
the
only
evidence
we
have
is
that
it
was
mailed
in
either
los
angeles
or
orange
county
and
it
was
received
in
orange
county,
and
that's
the
only
evidence
as
far
as
i'm
aware
in
the
record
indicating
the
scope
of
its
distribution.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
yes,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
believe
that
it
would
relieve
this
court
and
appellate
courts
from
determining
that
which
they
are
not
really
capable
of
determining
on
their
own.
the
constitutional
fact
law
of
question,
it
would
eliminate
that
for
consideration
and
would
permit
us
to
rely
on
the
jury
verdict
and
assuming
there
was
a
conviction,
a
substandard
--
sufficient
evidence
test
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
complied
with
due
process.
i
think
the
changing
standard
from
one
geographical
location
to
another,
again,
has
constitutional
background,
simply
because
we
do
have
the
one
variable
as
i
was
suggesting,
the
contemporary
community
standards.
it's
a
changing
standard
and
it
must
be
a
standard
that's
contemporary
with
our
time.
so
why
is
it
so
inconsistent
to
say
we
have
another
variable?
a
geographical
difference,
a
variable
that
--
variation
that
would
differ
from
geographical
location
to
another.
we
have
procedure
for
punishing
utterances
in
one
location
and
not
in
other.
fire
in
a
crowded
theater
is
punishable
and
in
open
field
it's
not,
the
words
are
the
same,
it's
the
location
that
constitutes
a
clear
and
present
danger
and
maybe
that's
what
we're
saying
in
this
case.
if
one
community
can
consider
matter
which
violates
its
particular
standard
for
limits
of
candor,
dangerous
and
within
its
police
power
and
yet
another
community,
really
one
is
so
considerate.
the
adapting
this
test,
the
appellate
courts
would
then
use
the
sufficient
evidence
test
to
review
convictions
and
the
time
saved
building
into
other
issues.
in
other,
whichever
test
is
used
in
a
particular
case,
i
would
suggest
that
the
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
if
we
use
a
national
standard,
i
would
suggest
that
the
statewide
standard
in
the
state
of
california
is
a
liberal
standard,
and
in
effect
had
--
as
a
net
effect
of
requiring
that
the
prosecution
a
greater
burden
of
proof
than
the
national
standard
had,
in
fact,
been
established
and
could
be
established.
the
statewide
standard,
that
was
what
has
done
in
this
case
and
if
it's
a
local
standard,
again,
it
operated
to
the
benefit
of
the
appellant
to
use
a
state
standard
because
the
statewide
standard,
i
would
submit
for
the
state
of
california,
is
again
somewhat
more
liberal
than
a
conservative
standard
of
orange
county
and
again
required
a
prosecution,
a
greater
burden
of
proof.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
no,
because
under
california
law,
it
would
still
be
required
prosecution
to
prove
that
the
matter
taken
as
a
whole
predominantly
appeals
to
a
prurient
interest
and
the
matter
taken
as
a
whole
is
utterly
without
redeeming
social
importance,
however
i
would
suggest
that--
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
said
that
it
was
a
state
standard
and
in
california
supreme
court.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
--said
there
was
a
state
standard
and
california
we
are
bound
by
a
state
standard
because
of
the
edict
of
our
state
supreme
court.
i'm
suggesting
however
that
the
constitution
requires
no
more
than
a
local
standard,
and
if
the
states
in
enacting
their
laws
wish
to
adopt
the
state
standard
or
a
national
standard,
they
should,
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
be
free
to
do
just
that.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
yes,
mr.
justice
douglas.
i
submit
the
matter
unless
there
are
further
questions.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
with
respect
to
the
in
rem
proceedings,
i
would
suggest
that
it
is
not
the
answer
for
as
mr.
justice
brennan
has
suggested.
it
doesn’t
solve
the
questions
raised
by
the
pandering
concept
enunciated
by
this
court
and
adopted
in
california
by
statute
nor
does
it
take
into
consideration
the
definition
which
this
court
has
given
to
obscenity
namely
that
to
be
obscene,
it
must
--
we
must
apply
contemporary
standards
or
customary
limits
of
candor.
as
i
suggested
last
january,
the
case
was
argued
before
this
court,
contemporary
standards,
if
they
are
contemporary,
they’re
going
to
change
maybe
from
day-to-day,
certainly
from
month-to-month
or
year-to-year.
and
we’re
going
to
have
to
constantly
reexamine
that
same
book
to
see
whether
or
not
it’s
obscene
applying
contemporary
standards,
not
the
standard
that
was
applied
six
months
ago
when
the
hearing
was
held.
with
respect
to
the
knowledge
that
is
necessary,
i
suggest
that
the
only
knowledge
necessary
is
knowledge
as
to
what
is
in
the
book.
to
require
that
the
person
disseminating
the
material
must
know
that
the
material
is
obscene
would
be
to
totally
insulate
the
distribution
of
this
type
of
material
from
any
sort
of
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
of
course,
i
anticipated
another
problem
that
that
would
raise
and
that
in
a
civil
proceeding,
the
burden
of
proof
is
by
a
preponderance
whereas
in
a
criminal
proceeding,
it
would
be
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
so,
there
would
be
another
disparity
there.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
well,
in
effect
in
california,
as
mr.
marks
has
suggested,
we
have
what
borders
on
that
sort
of
procedures,
it’s
not
as
a
civil
proceeding
at
such
but
it’s
a
preliminary
determination
of
the
constitutional
question,
the
mixed
question
of
law
in
fact
[voice
overlap].
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
some
judges,
i
feel,
possibly
do
that.
they
feel
that
--
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
i
think
the
initial
question
should
be
a
probable
cause
determination
if
we
are
in
fact
going
to
have
that
determination
but
i
would
suggest
that
that
determination
that’s
made
by
the
trial
judge
is
the
same
determination
that
is
facing
this
court
in
each
obscenity
case
and
that
if
we
adopt
a
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
test,
that
that
initial
determination
doesn’t
necessarily
have
to
be
made.
that
is
to
say,
is
it
protected
in
the
constitutional
sense
as
a
matter
of
law
and
if
not,
then
the
person
is
going
to
stand
on
trial
but
merely
treated
as
we
would
any
other
case,
hold
the
trial
and
then
that
the
conclusion
of
the
trial
and
review,
determine
whether
or
not
there’s
sufficient
evidence
to
sustain
the
conviction
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
to
moral
certainty.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
yes,
i
don’t
know
but
there’s
really
that
much
difference
however
between
--
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
well,
that’s
true
but
it’s
a
matter
of
either
it
is
or
it
isn’t
rather
than
it
is
by
degrees.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
if
there
such
is
a
civil
proceeding
provided
for
by
law
and
that
may
very
well
be
what
would
be
necessary.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
well,
there’s
a
determination
that’s
made
by
the
judge
as
to
whether
or
not
this
matter
is
constitutionally
protected
and
the
question
of
law,
as
i
suggested
that
the
question
that
this
court
determines
every
time
an
allegedly
obscene
book
or
obscene
matter
is
presented
to
it
for
review.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
well,
i
will
concede
that
the
practice
does
differ
among
the
judges,
the
trial
judges.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
i’d
say
it’s
probably
similar.
the
two?
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
that’s
right.
however,
if
in
that
procedure
that
california
follows,
if
we
required
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
before
we
could
get
to
the
jury.
we
would
in
effect
be
denied
a
jury
trial
and
if
we
prove
that
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
to
the
judge
why
is
a
jury
trial
necessary.
or
if
the
rules
--
no
matter
how
it
rules
one
party
to
the
proceeding
is
being
denied,
the
constitutional
right
to
a
trial
by
jury.
i
think
we
have
to
first
determine
whether
or
not
this
particular
matter
justifies
going
to
trial.
that’s
the
procedure
that’s
followed
in
california
at
the
present
time.
that’s
the
procedure
that
was
followed
in
this
case
contrary
to
the
suggestion
propounded
by
mr.
marks.
there
was
a
determination
by
the
trial
judge
shortly
after
the
arrest
of
this
case,
a
determination
that
this
was
not
constitutionally
protected
matter.
that
took
place
in
may
of
1969.
mr.
marks
attempted
to
appeal
that
to
the
appellate
department
of
our
superior
court
and
the
appellate
department
of
the
superior
court
concluded
that
the
trial
judge
was
correct
and
this
was
not
constitutionally
protected
matter
and
it
was
after
that
decision
by
the
appellate
department
of
the
orange
county,
california
superior
court
that
the
decision
of
the
l.a.
municipal
court
which
is
a
written
opinion
and
relied
upon
by
mr.
marks
was
signed,
so
if
there’s
a
doctrine
of
res
judicata
or
collateral
estoppel
that
applies
in
this
case,
if
the
initial
decision
was
the
judge
who
heard
that
matter
in
this
case
and
concluded
this
was
not
constitutionally
protected
material
and
the
trial
judge
in
los
angeles
county
should’ve
been
bound
by
that
determination
as
opposed
to
orange
county
being
bound
by
the
later
decision
of
the
l.a.
municipal
court
judge.
the
case
was
tried,
evidence
was
produced
and
the
jury
was
instructed
on
the
basis
of
a
statewide
standard
for
customary
limits
of
candor.
it
was
on
appeal
for
the
first
time
that
the
appellants
suggested
that
a
nationwide
standard
should
be
adopted
and
applied.
this
was
after
he
had
produced
evidence
and
concurred
an
instruction
to
the
jury
that
statewide
standard
should
be
applied.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
yes,
the
material
must
go
substantially
beyond
--
applying
contemporary
standards
must
go
substantially
beyond
customary
limits
of
candor.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
honesty,
frankness,
purity.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
yes,
as
to
all
allegedly
obscene
material,
that’s
the
test
that
is
applied
to
determine
whether
or
not
--
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
no.
i
think
it’s
a
term
that
is
exclusively
used
for
--
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
well,
it’s
a
phrase
that
is
enacted
by
statute
following
the
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
there
are
varying
definitions,
i
believe
propounded
by
the
dictionary.
purity
is
one
of
them.
frankness
is
but
one
definition
that
it
is
used.
however,
simply
because
someone
is
frank
or
honest
do
not
necessarily
insulate
that
conduct
of
speech
and
i
think
similarly
would
be
liable
if
it’s
done
maliciously
even
though
it
might
be
honest,
does
say
truthful.
it
suggests
that
the
constitution
does
not
require
that
a
nationwide
standard
be
adopted
if
were
to
say
that
the
limitation
of
states
is
through
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
implication
is
that
the
states
may
deprive
its
citizens
of
life,
liberty,
or
property
if
due
process
is
followed
or
complied
with
and
due
process
in
the
past
has
not
required
that
each
state
have
identical
laws
for
depriving
its
citizens
of
liberty.
the
different
states
provide
varying
types
of
conduct
as
criminal
and
it
seems
that
it
should
be
no
different
for
each
state
to
have
a
slightly
different
definition
as
to
what
constitutes
obscenity
than
it
is
to
have
a
slightly
different
definition
as
to
what
constitutes
burglary
or
any
other
crime.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
no
but
it
involves
conduct
and
it
involves
freedom
of
action
if
each
state
must
have
an
identical
definition
as
to
what
constitutes
obscenity,
how
can
we
avoid
the
conclusion
that
the
definition
of
any
crime
must
be
the
same
from
state
to
state
because
in
obscenity,
we’re
talking
about
the
freedom
of
speech.
in
any
other
sort
of
criminal
conduct,
we’re
talking
about
freedom
of
action
and
i’d
suggest
that
freedom
of
action
is
likewise
a
very,
very
basic
--
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
the
other
is
in
the
--
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
no,
but
freedom
--
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
no
but
freedom
to
do
what
we
wish
and
what
the
states
prescribed
certain
conduct
as
not
being
permissible
likewise
from
state
to
state
if
we’re
talking
about
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
should
we
not
have
different
definitions
as
to
what
constitutes
obscenity.
the
fact
that
--
well,
in
addition
to
the
constitutional
argument,
i’d
suggest
that
practicality
suggests
that
a
nationwide
standard
is
simply
not
possible.
in
denver,
the
dancers
wear
pasties
and
g-strings.
in
southern
california,
they
wear
nothing.
what
is
the
standard?
or
to
further
illustrate
it,
let’s
assume
for
the
sake
of
illustration
that
the
east
of
mississippi,
the
dancers
wear
pasties.
west
of
the
mississippi,
they
don’t
wear
pasties.
what
is
the
national
community
standard
for
limits
of
candor?
how
are
we
going
to
average
or
determine
something
that’s
not
subject
to
determination?
from
a
practical
point
of
view,
it
would
be
very
easy
for
the
appellant
of
this
case
to
determine
the
standard
in
the
various
localities,
much
easier
than
it
would
be
for
him
to
determine
the
standard
by
a
nationwide
basis.
the
whole
is
made
up
of
the
parts
and
while
the
parts
may
be
readily
identified,
simply
by
identifying
the
parts,
you
can’t
necessarily
arrive
at
a
description
as
to
what
the
whole
is.
if
we
were
to
adopt
something
that
was
acceptable
to
the
nation
as
a
whole,
we
would
probably
have
something
akin
to
what
we
see
on
tv,
something
that’s
acceptable
for
dissemination
indiscriminately
in
any
home
and
to
anyone
who
might
see
it
which
in
effect,
what
we
have
in
this
case.
it
was
mail
unsolicited
into
the
home
where
anyone
within
the
home
might
open
it
and
see
it.
thirdly,
i
would
suggest
with
relation
to
the
earlier
comments
that
judges
in
determining
obscenity
in
the
constitutional
sense
are
determining
a
question
of
law
and
the
local
judges
are
not
capable
of
determining
what
the
national
standard
for
limits
of
candor
is.
how
are
they
going
to
determine
what
the
limits
of
candor
nationwide
are?
experts
--
experts
may
define
it
for
the
trial
judge
but
if
we
have
conflicting
experts,
how
is
the
appellate
judge
to
resolve
the
conflict?
the
basic
principle
that
the
prior
fact
can
determine
credibility
because
he
used
the
witness
is
absent
when
the
appellate
judge
was
looking
at
the
whole
record.
further
as
attorneys
and
judges
and
i
think
it’s
easy
for
us
to
accept
the
proposition
that
speech
acceptable
in
one
location
is
not
acceptable
in
another.
we
describe
things
one
way
in
the
office
to
contemporaries,
partners
and
associates
which
description
if
use
in
court
would
probably
subject
us
to
contempt.
why?
if
location
is
not
important,
why
can’t
we
speak
the
same
way
in
the
courtroom
that
we
can
speak
in
the
office?
and
i
think
obviously
that
in
that
situation,
we
recognize
that
the
limits
of
candor,
honesty,
frankness
differs
from
place
to
place
because
we
have
two
different
communities
in
effect,
the
office
and
the
courtroom.
and
the
same
is
true
from
city
to
city,
county
to
county.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
no,
mr.
justice
marshall
but
we
use
different
terms
sometimes
to
describe
the
same
thing
in
court
than
we
do
in
chambers,
in
the
office
or
sometimes
other
court
and
i
think
the
reason
is
the
--
not
simply
a
question
of
honesty
because
both
descriptions
are
honest
and
frank
and
described
the
same
thing
but
it’s
the
language
that’s
used
is
acceptable
in
one
location
and
not
acceptable
in
another
location.
the
test
then
submitted
the
states
are
free
to
adopt
whichever
community
they
choose
whether
it
be
local,
state
or
national
for
determining
customary
limits
of
candor.
in
this
case,
the
state
chose
the
statewide
community
and
it’s
submitted
that
the
evidence
simply
established
that
community
was
--
the
standard
for
that
community
was
exceeded.
the
evidence
amply
established
that
the
material
predominantly
appealed
to
a
prurient
interest
and
although
mr.
marks
says,
he
hasn’t
seen
the
case
since
ginsberg
that
involve
pandering,
i
would
suggest
that
this
case
itself
may
be
very
well
involve
pandering.
these
were
brochures
containing
a
number
of
scenes
from
the
book
they
purported
to
advertise
and
very
little
of
the
text
of
the
book
is
there,
only
the
most
graphic
depictions
of
sexual
activity
selling
predominately
the
prurient
appeal
of
the
books
as
opposed
to
whatever
social
value
they
may
or
may
not
have.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
that’s
correct,
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
it’s
not,
i
would
concede.
it’s
extremely
difficult
to
establish.
in
adopting
a
statewide
standard,
the
state
court
said
that
expert
must
be
used
to
establish
what
that
standard
is
or
to
assist
the
prior
facts
in
determining
that
standard.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
it’s
possible.
although,
they
administered
an
oath
and
asked
to
follow
the
law
and
presumably,
they
do
follow
the
law.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
oh!
most
definitely.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
that’s
correct.
i’m
suggesting
that
the
constitution
does
not
make
that
standard
impermissible
and
the
constitution
would
likewise
permit
of
a
local
standard
if
the
law
of
that
state
indicated
a
local
standard.
in
other
words,
the
state
itself
is
just
free
to
adopt
a
standard
which
it
see
is
fit
and
neither
three
or
neither
of
the
three
standards,
local,
state
or
national
violate
the
constitution
that’s
applied
to
the
states
through
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
most
definitely.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
that’s
correct.
most
definitely
simply
because
the
expert
testifies
doesn’t
mean
the
jury
has
to
accept
that
which
he
relates
to
them,
if
he
just
believes
that
witness.
but
responding
further
to
the
question,
the
statewide
standard
is
difficult
to
determine
or
to
prove
or
to
provide
experts
on
the
extremely
difficult
a
nationwide
standard
requiring
experts
to
establish
would
be
virtually
impossible
to
do.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
maybe
just
left
to
juries
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
no
question
about
it.
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
that’s
the
nature
of
the
system.
that’s
correct.
further
with
respect
to
the
third
element
that’s
required
in
california
by
statute
and
that’s
the
issue
of
utterly
without
redeeming
social
importance,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
the
redeeming
aspect
of
social
importance
and
ask
that
that
not
be
treated
lightly
or
dropped
from
the
full
phrase.
it
seems
to
be
glossed
over
on
occasion
or
completely
eliminated
but
if
the
phrase
is
to
have
meeting
then
the
redeeming
aspect
of
utterly
without
redeeming
social
importance
must
be
emphasized.
everything
as
suggested
by
justice
white
has
some
value
to
society
whether
we
learn
from
it
hopefully
and
if
that
is
the
test
strictly
social
importance
or
social
value
then
nothing
is
going
to
be
obscene
but
we
must
have
--
it
must
be
utterly
without
redeeming
social
importance.
i
would
ask
that
the
court
reject
the
necessity
of
determining
obscenity
in
a
constitutional
sense
on
a
piece-by-piece
basis
and
adopt
a
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
test
as
hide
in
other
cases.
no
matter
which
test
is
adopted,
submitted
that
the
material
in
this
case
is
patently
offensive
and
substantially
exceeds
any
conceivable
standards
or
limits
of
candor
and
for
that
reason,
we
submit
the
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
initially
i
would
like
to
attempt
to
set
the
records
straight
in
this
matter
and
in
the
april
of
1969,
a
complaint
was
filed
in
the
municipal
court
of
the
harbor
judicial
district
for
orange
county.
thereafter
on
april
16th,
1969
the
demurrer
was
filed
by
mr.
marks,
the
defendant
of
that
action.
thereafter,
an
amended
complaint
was
filed
may
9th,
1969
and
following
the
amended
complaint
the
same
demurrer
was
held
to
apply
to
the
amended
complaint.
the
hearing
and
the
demurrer,
under
california
law
is
limited
to
face
the
complaint.
however,
mr.
marks
did
introduce
expert
testimony
at
that
time,
expert
testimony
related
to
the
obscenity
of
the
material
in
question.
that
was
not
controverted
by
the
prosecution
simply
because
on
demurrer,
no
evidence
can
be
taken,
the
inquiry
is
limited
to
the
face
of
the
complaint.
thereafter
there
was
an
appeal
to
the
appellate
department
in
the
superior
court
in
orange
county,
and
the
denial
of
demurrer
was
sustained.
now
this
record
--
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
i
understand
that
to
be
one
of
his
contentions
mr.
justice
douglas.
however,
i
think
he
is
also
--
maybe
contention
that
action
in
the
joining
county
constituted
res
judicata.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
i
tend
to
disagree
with
him.
i
think
depending
on
how
the
standard,
was
a
definition
announced
by
this
court
is
interpreted,
it
is
workable.
i
think
the
procedural
aspects
and
there
must
be
a
clarification.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
well,
california
has
gone
one
step
beyond
roth
and
has
adopted
a
position
that
is
not
(inaudible)
by
majority
of
this
court
as
being
constitutionally
required,
and
that
the
california
statue
requires
that
the
prosecution
established
that
the
material
goes
substantially
beyond
customary
limits
of
candor
that
it
predominantly
appealed
to
prurient
interest
and
the
material
considered
as
a
whole,
utterly
without
revealing
social
importance.
so
by
statue
in
california,
all
three
elements
must
be
established
by
the
prosecution
and
must
correlate.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
well,
it
adopts
the
definition
of
obscenity
as
first
they
founded
in
roth
and
then
later
expanded
upon
i
believe
in
memoirs,
utterly
without
redeeming
social
importance
aspect.
we
don't
think
a
majority
of
the
court
concurred
in
that
requirement
but
nevertheless
california
by
a
legislative
act
has
added
that
third
requirement.
that
is
why
there
were
experts
produced
by
the
people
on
all
three
of
those
elements
definition
and
the
jury
was
instructed
as
to
all
three
and
instructed
that
they
must
pull
it
up.
nevertheless
counsel
points
to
the
action
that
took
place
in
los
angles
county
and
with
respect
to
that
action
in
the
opinion
of
the
los
angles
county
municipal
court
judge,
that
was
never
directly
pointed
out
to
the
judge
in
which
the
action
was
pending,
the
instant
action
was
pending
for
trial.
it's
part
of
the
record,
the
clerk's
transcript
in
this
appeal,
simply
because
it
was
not
exhibit
to
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
prohibition
that
was
filed
in
our
superior
court,
attempting
to
prohibit
the
misdemeanor
prosecution.
in
filing
that
petition
for
prohibition
with
our
superior
court,
he
apparently
lodged
a
courtesy
copy
with
the
municipal
court
and
that
is
how
it
became
a
part
of
our
record.
then,
thereafter
just
prior
to
the
trial,
he
did
make
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
basis
of
res
judicata,
but
no
evidence
was
presented
and
there
was
no
hearing
on
that
particular
motion
and
in
particular,
the
opinion
was
not
a
part
of
that
particular
motion.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
that
was
a
dismissal
on
a
preliminary
motion
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
it
did
not
go
to
trial,
it
was
what
is
known
in
california,
a
motion,
a
determination
of
the
question
of
law.
the
mixed
question
of
constitutional
fact
and
law.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
in
los
angles
county,
i
believe
it
was
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
demurrer
based
on
two
cases,
people
versus
(inaudible)
as
i
recall.
now,
the
appellent
contends
that
this
court
or
at
least
the
members
of
this
court
had
in
the
past
suggested
and
this
court
should
continue
to
conduct
de
novo
hearings
to
determine
obscenity
going
on.
and
further
suggests
that
in
reaching
that
determination
of
constitutional
fact,
that
makes
question
of
fact
and
law,
the
judge
when
applying
contemporary
standards
for
customary
limits
of
candor
should
adopt
a
national
community
standard.
what
appellant
requests
maybe
easier
for
this
court
than
for
other
courts
because
the
scope
of
this
court's
judicial
inquiry
is
nationwide,
or
suggest
even
for
this
court,
it's
not
an
easy
task
and
is,
in
fact,
an
impossible
task.
appellant
also
suggests
that
each
judge
from
the
trial
level
through
each
level
of
review
should
redetermine
the
issue,
de
novo
using
the
same
test,
the
national
test.
and
i
would
submit
that
this
is
practically
impossible,
local
trial,
appellate
and
state
supreme
justice,
they
just
don't
have
the
sufficient
scope
of
judicial
inquiry
to
apply
a
national
standard
with
respect
to
their
contact
with
national
standards
for
customary
limits
of
candor,
i
would
suggest
that
it
is
no
more
broad
than
the
average
potential
juror.
i
think
the
case
which
counsel
has
just
called
this
court's
attention
to
this
morning
with
their
circuit
case,
demonstrates
that
when
judge
thornsbury
indicates
that
he
is
not
sufficiently
qualified
to
determine
customary
limits
of
candor.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
yes
mr.
justice
douglas.
in
fact,
mr.
marks
has
suggested
experts,
but
i
think
that
demonstrates
another
problem
that
we'll
further
confound
the
problems
that
are
already
existing.
experts
maybe
fine
for
the
initial
judge,
the
trial
judge,
who
can
examine
the
witness,
determine
his
credibility,
watch
the
demeanor
while
he's
testifying
and
all
the
things
that
a
triar
of
fact
generally
does,
but
what
position
does
that
leave
the
appellate
judge,
the
reviewing
judge
in?
if
there
are
conflicting
experts,
how
does
he
determine
credibility
of
the
varying
witnesses?
it's
totally
impossible
to
say
that
the
reviewing
judge
would
determine
credibility,
would
be
a
substantial
departure
from
the
(inaudible)
rules
of
the
appellate
review.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
i
don't
think
it's
that
difficult
for
a
publisher
to
know
when
he's
crossed
the
line.
in
fact,
the
reporter's
transcript
in
this
particular
case,
in
this
volume
2
around
page
50,
give
or
take
a
few
pages,
indicates
that
mr.
miller
indicated
to
the
person
who
was
sending
the
material
out
that
the
brochures
themselves
he
felt
were
borderline,
but
the
material
itself
that
they
were
advertising,
he
considered
to
be
pornographic.
the
brochures
are
nothing
but
the
more
graphic
depictions
of
sexual
activity
that
are
contained
in
what
he
himself
described
as
pornography.
well,
i
think
--
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
no,
it
wasn't
your
honor.
it
was
a
trial,
the
statement
made
by
mr.
miller
came
in
by
way
of
one
of
the
persons
who
was
stopping
the
envelopes
and
perisisting
in
the
distribution.
i
would
suggest,
however,
that
if
we
do
apply
the
approach
in
the
instant
case
that
each
level
of
court
must
determine
a
constitutional
fact
law
question
that
it's
readily
apparent
that
in
this
case,
as
far
as
that
constitutional
fact
is
concerned,
that
this
material
is
obscene,
no
matter
what
test
is
used,
whether
we
use
a
local,
state
or
national
community.
it
exceeds
candor
of
any
community.
it
predominantly
appeals
to
the
prurient
interest,
and
is
utterly
without
redeeming
social
importance,
the
california
test.
having
concluded
that
it's
not
constitutionally
protective,
it
submitted
that
this
material
should
fall
into
the
same
category
as
any
other
conduct
that
a
state
can
regulate
by
its
police
power,
any
other
conduct
which
is
not
itself
constitutionally
protected
and
the
states
in
regulating
that
other
non-constitutional
conduct
can
define
it
in
any
manner
they
wish.
the
state's
vary
in
the
definition
of
robbery
from
state
to
state,
perjury
varies
from
state
to
state,
and
assuming
this
initial
constitutional
fact
law,
determinations
made
by
judge
is
determined
that
it's
not
constitutionally
protected
then
the
state
should
be
free
to
adopt
whatever
standard
they
wish
just
as
they
do
in
other
areas
of
criminal
law.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
yes,
your
honor.
in
the
county
of
orange,
we've
utilized
what's
known
as
a
red
light
abatement
act
to
abate
as
a
public
nuisance,
places
that
are
used
for
loot
purposes,
prostitution
and
assignation,
more
often
in
the
area
of
live
entertainment,
in
the
area
of
printed
material.
but
submit
however,
that
it's
not
necessary
to
do
as
appellant
suggests
to
determine
this
constitutional
fact
in
this
manner,
when
looking
at
a
state
prosecution
under
state
law.
the
constitution
permits
the
states
to
adopt
the
standard
that
state
chooses
as
long
as
the
standard
is
compatible
with
due
process
in
isolating
obscenity
as
justice
harlan
said
the
state
by
the
due
process
liberty
provision
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
has
not
held
the
same
test
as
has
the
federal
government
under
the
first
amendment.
as
justice
harlan
indicated,
that's
readily
apparent
from
the
language
of
the
two
amendments
themselves,
the
first
provides
congress
shall
make
no
law
and
obviously,
we
can't
apply
that
in
its
precise
terms
through
the
state
through
the
fourth
amendment
because
congress
doesn't
exist
in
this
state.
so
obviously,
we
have
to
do
some
initial
editing.
additionally,
it's
rather
obvious
that
if
in
enacting
the
fourteenth
amendment,
it
was
the
intent
to
restrict
the
state
as
the
first
restricts
congress,
it
would
have
been
very
simple
and
to
have
so
stated
that
the
states
are
prohibited
from
enacting
any
law
abridging
the
freedom
of
speech.
i
would
certainly
not
suggest
that
those
persons
who
framed
the
fourteenth
amendment
were
so
imprecise
and
so
inarticulate,
that
if
that
had
been
their
intent
with
the
background
of
the
first
amendment,
that
something
consistent
with
the
first
amendment
could
have
been
specifically
provided
to
the
states.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
we
haven't
progressed
in
our
cases
that
are
pending
against
a
particular
bookstore
to
the
point
where
we
have
applied
it.
there
have
been
acts
of
mootness
as
well
as
the
sale
and
distribution
of
books
from
that
particular
bookstore
that
have
gone
inside
the
premises.
the
act
itself
states
that
it
applies
to
places
of
prostitution,
assignation
or
lewdness.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
yes,
your
honor,
in
its
expressed
terms
i
feel
that
--
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
i
would
suggest
that
the
--
again
the
decision
taken
by
mr.
justice
harlan
and
expressed
by
him
in
the
roth
case
is
entirely
reasonable
and
it's
consistent
with
the
constitution.
when
we're
talking
about
the
deprivation
of
one
of
the
fundamental
liberties
without
due
process
of
law.
the
inquiry
should
be
whether
or
not
the
state
action
so
subverts
the
fundamental
liberties
implicit
in
the
due
process
clause
that
it
cannot
be
sustained
as
a
rational
exercise
of
power
and
i
would
submit
that
adoption
by
state
of
a
local
or
statewide
standards
for
limits
of
candor
as
a
portion
of
the
definition
of
obscenity
is
not
subversive
of
fundamental
liberties,
but
is
actually
a
rational
exercise
of
power,
whether
--
i
would
suggest
that
neither
practicality,
reason
or
the
constitution
require
a
national
standard
for
customary
limits
of
candor
as
suggested
by
the
appellant.
initially,
i
would
suggest
that
practicality
demands
that
something
other
than
a
national
standard
be
used.
how
is
a
national
standard
to
be
determined
fully
apart
from
the
legal
question,
the
mixed
question
of
constitutional
fact
law,
as
a
matter
of
fact
presented
to
the
jury,
how
is
a
national
standard
to
be
determined.
well,
as
far
as
that
factual
determination,
i
would
assume
that
experts
could
testify,
however
in
this
case,
an
expert
testified
as
to
the
statewide
standard,
an
expert
who
is
employee
of
the
los
angeles
police
department,
took
him
30
days
to
conduct
his
survey
analysis
of
the
state
and
five
years
on
the
job.
say,
if
los
angeles
now
charges
$400
a
day,
every
time
another
experts
goes
outside
the
city
limits
to
testify
to
recoup
the
cost
of
conducting
their
survey
and
updating
their
survey.
can
you
imagine
the
additional
cost
that
would
be
involved
that
that
expert
had
to
spend
30
days
traveling
each
of
the
50
states,
why
we're
taking
50
months
just
to
complete
a
survey?
long
before
he
completed
the
survey,
he
would
have
to
update
it
because
it
requires
contemporary
community
standard.
so
if
we
multiply
the
cost
by
50
times
400
and
a
time,
50
times
a
month,
totally
impossible
and
impractical.
now
i'm
not
suggesting
that
cost
to
loan
is
a
factor
that
should
cause
us
to
overlook
any
constitutional
rights.
i'm
simply
suggesting
constitution
itself
does
not
require
experts
and
it's
impractical,
impractical
to
prove
through
experts
a
national
standard.
reason
also
requires
that
a
local
standard,
local
state
standard
be
adapted.
obviously,
one
local
area
will
accept
material
that
another
local
area
will
not.
a
national
standard
who
very
likely
prevents
a
local
community
that
had
liberal
attitude
and
would
accept
material.
from
receiving
that
material,
because
of
the
restrict
of
influence
of
a
conservative
community
some
2500
miles
away.
and
the
opposite
is
also
true.
the
conservative
community
would
be
forced
to
accept
material
because
of
a
nationwide
standard
that
is
diluted
by
a
more
liberal
standard
of
a
community
again,
2500
miles
away.
thus
adoption
of
a
national
standard
would
have
just
the
effect
that
the
appellant
in
this
case
and
in
the
amici
are
suggesting
as
undesirable.
it
would
have
the
result
of
making
this
all
one,
making
this
all
little
thin
soldiers
out
of
a
mold,
all
receiving
the
same
material,
the
same
standard
and
would
not
provide
for
differences
from
one
community
to
another.
we
suggest
additionally
that
the
constitution
supports
a
state
or
local
community
standard.
initially
in
roth,
this
court
used
the
term
community
and
inspite
of
the
dictionary
definition,
that's
in
the
footnote
2
to
jacobellis
suggest
that
the
customary
meaning
of
the
community
is
a
local
community,
the
area
in
which
people
shop,
work,
live
and
entertain
themselves.
i
think
that
definition
of
community
is
also
consistent
with
the
same
paragraph
of
the
dictionary
referred
to
in
that
footnote
of
jacobellis
which
defines
community
as
society
as
a
whole.
additionally,
it's
constitutionally
permissible
to
accept
that
local
or
statewide
standard
because
of
the
definition
announced
in
roth,
that
the
community
standard
must
be
contemporary
with
the
times,
without
that
term
contemporary
we
would
be
stuck,
i
would
assume
with
the
same
definition
of
obscenity
that
existed
in
1791
when
the
first
amendment
was
adopted.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
i
think
it
must
be
a
standard,
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
related
at
the
same
time
as
the
distribution
or
the
time
of
the
crime,
i
think
it
has
to
exist
in
tune
with
our
particular
times.
it's
not
a
community
standard
that
existed
in
say
1850
or
1791
because
of
the
term
contemporary.
we
have
--
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
i
think
that
is
true
mr.
chief
justice
that
--
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
i
think
it's
a
task
that
has
been
reported
almost
by
the
term
contemporary
and
the
california
supreme
court
in
a
case
of
in
re
giannini
requiring
that
community
standards
be
established
by
experts.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
yes
sir,
mr.
justice
douglas,
however.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
no,
in
this
case
we
are
not
dealing
with
double
dating.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
well,
the
same
marked
definition
of
obscene
was
applied
to
the
topless
dancing
in
in
re
giannini
as
it's
applied
to
printed
matter
in
california
because
of
the
california
supreme
court
statement
that
the
dancing
is
an
expressive
conduct.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
well,
i'm
suggesting
--
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
i
submit
that
the
constitution
permits
a
changing
standard
based
on
geographical
lines,
even
if
the
material
is
distributed
nationwide.
now
in
this
case,
we
have
no
evidence
that
the
material
was
distributed
nationwide.
the
only
evidence
we
have
is
that
it
was
mailed
in
either
los
angeles
or
orange
county
and
it
was
received
in
orange
county,
and
that's
the
only
evidence
as
far
as
i'm
aware
in
the
record
indicating
the
scope
of
its
distribution.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
yes,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
believe
that
it
would
relieve
this
court
and
appellate
courts
from
determining
that
which
they
are
not
really
capable
of
determining
on
their
own.
the
constitutional
fact
law
of
question,
it
would
eliminate
that
for
consideration
and
would
permit
us
to
rely
on
the
jury
verdict
and
assuming
there
was
a
conviction,
a
substandard
--
sufficient
evidence
test
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
complied
with
due
process.
i
think
the
changing
standard
from
one
geographical
location
to
another,
again,
has
constitutional
background,
simply
because
we
do
have
the
one
variable
as
i
was
suggesting,
the
contemporary
community
standards.
it's
a
changing
standard
and
it
must
be
a
standard
that's
contemporary
with
our
time.
so
why
is
it
so
inconsistent
to
say
we
have
another
variable?
a
geographical
difference,
a
variable
that
--
variation
that
would
differ
from
geographical
location
to
another.
we
have
procedure
for
punishing
utterances
in
one
location
and
not
in
other.
fire
in
a
crowded
theater
is
punishable
and
in
open
field
it's
not,
the
words
are
the
same,
it's
the
location
that
constitutes
a
clear
and
present
danger
and
maybe
that's
what
we're
saying
in
this
case.
if
one
community
can
consider
matter
which
violates
its
particular
standard
for
limits
of
candor,
dangerous
and
within
its
police
power
and
yet
another
community,
really
one
is
so
considerate.
the
adapting
this
test,
the
appellate
courts
would
then
use
the
sufficient
evidence
test
to
review
convictions
and
the
time
saved
building
into
other
issues.
in
other,
whichever
test
is
used
in
a
particular
case,
i
would
suggest
that
the
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
if
we
use
a
national
standard,
i
would
suggest
that
the
statewide
standard
in
the
state
of
california
is
a
liberal
standard,
and
in
effect
had
--
as
a
net
effect
of
requiring
that
the
prosecution
a
greater
burden
of
proof
than
the
national
standard
had,
in
fact,
been
established
and
could
be
established.
the
statewide
standard,
that
was
what
has
done
in
this
case
and
if
it's
a
local
standard,
again,
it
operated
to
the
benefit
of
the
appellant
to
use
a
state
standard
because
the
statewide
standard,
i
would
submit
for
the
state
of
california,
is
again
somewhat
more
liberal
than
a
conservative
standard
of
orange
county
and
again
required
a
prosecution,
a
greater
burden
of
proof.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
no,
because
under
california
law,
it
would
still
be
required
prosecution
to
prove
that
the
matter
taken
as
a
whole
predominantly
appeals
to
a
prurient
interest
and
the
matter
taken
as
a
whole
is
utterly
without
redeeming
social
importance,
however
i
would
suggest
that--
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
said
that
it
was
a
state
standard
and
in
california
supreme
court.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
--said
there
was
a
state
standard
and
california
we
are
bound
by
a
state
standard
because
of
the
edict
of
our
state
supreme
court.
i'm
suggesting
however
that
the
constitution
requires
no
more
than
a
local
standard,
and
if
the
states
in
enacting
their
laws
wish
to
adopt
the
state
standard
or
a
national
standard,
they
should,
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
be
free
to
do
just
that.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
yes,
mr.
justice
douglas.
i
submit
the
matter
unless
there
are
further
questions.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
with
respect
to
the
in
rem
proceedings,
i
would
suggest
that
it
is
not
the
answer
for
as
mr.
justice
brennan
has
suggested.
it
doesn’t
solve
the
questions
raised
by
the
pandering
concept
enunciated
by
this
court
and
adopted
in
california
by
statute
nor
does
it
take
into
consideration
the
definition
which
this
court
has
given
to
obscenity
namely
that
to
be
obscene,
it
must
--
we
must
apply
contemporary
standards
or
customary
limits
of
candor.
as
i
suggested
last
january,
the
case
was
argued
before
this
court,
contemporary
standards,
if
they
are
contemporary,
they’re
going
to
change
maybe
from
day-to-day,
certainly
from
month-to-month
or
year-to-year.
and
we’re
going
to
have
to
constantly
reexamine
that
same
book
to
see
whether
or
not
it’s
obscene
applying
contemporary
standards,
not
the
standard
that
was
applied
six
months
ago
when
the
hearing
was
held.
with
respect
to
the
knowledge
that
is
necessary,
i
suggest
that
the
only
knowledge
necessary
is
knowledge
as
to
what
is
in
the
book.
to
require
that
the
person
disseminating
the
material
must
know
that
the
material
is
obscene
would
be
to
totally
insulate
the
distribution
of
this
type
of
material
from
any
sort
of
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
of
course,
i
anticipated
another
problem
that
that
would
raise
and
that
in
a
civil
proceeding,
the
burden
of
proof
is
by
a
preponderance
whereas
in
a
criminal
proceeding,
it
would
be
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
so,
there
would
be
another
disparity
there.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
well,
in
effect
in
california,
as
mr.
marks
has
suggested,
we
have
what
borders
on
that
sort
of
procedures,
it’s
not
as
a
civil
proceeding
at
such
but
it’s
a
preliminary
determination
of
the
constitutional
question,
the
mixed
question
of
law
in
fact
[voice
overlap].
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
some
judges,
i
feel,
possibly
do
that.
they
feel
that
--
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
i
think
the
initial
question
should
be
a
probable
cause
determination
if
we
are
in
fact
going
to
have
that
determination
but
i
would
suggest
that
that
determination
that’s
made
by
the
trial
judge
is
the
same
determination
that
is
facing
this
court
in
each
obscenity
case
and
that
if
we
adopt
a
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
test,
that
that
initial
determination
doesn’t
necessarily
have
to
be
made.
that
is
to
say,
is
it
protected
in
the
constitutional
sense
as
a
matter
of
law
and
if
not,
then
the
person
is
going
to
stand
on
trial
but
merely
treated
as
we
would
any
other
case,
hold
the
trial
and
then
that
the
conclusion
of
the
trial
and
review,
determine
whether
or
not
there’s
sufficient
evidence
to
sustain
the
conviction
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
to
moral
certainty.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
yes,
i
don’t
know
but
there’s
really
that
much
difference
however
between
--
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
well,
that’s
true
but
it’s
a
matter
of
either
it
is
or
it
isn’t
rather
than
it
is
by
degrees.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
if
there
such
is
a
civil
proceeding
provided
for
by
law
and
that
may
very
well
be
what
would
be
necessary.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
well,
there’s
a
determination
that’s
made
by
the
judge
as
to
whether
or
not
this
matter
is
constitutionally
protected
and
the
question
of
law,
as
i
suggested
that
the
question
that
this
court
determines
every
time
an
allegedly
obscene
book
or
obscene
matter
is
presented
to
it
for
review.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
well,
i
will
concede
that
the
practice
does
differ
among
the
judges,
the
trial
judges.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
i’d
say
it’s
probably
similar.
the
two?
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
that’s
right.
however,
if
in
that
procedure
that
california
follows,
if
we
required
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
before
we
could
get
to
the
jury.
we
would
in
effect
be
denied
a
jury
trial
and
if
we
prove
that
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
to
the
judge
why
is
a
jury
trial
necessary.
or
if
the
rules
--
no
matter
how
it
rules
one
party
to
the
proceeding
is
being
denied,
the
constitutional
right
to
a
trial
by
jury.
i
think
we
have
to
first
determine
whether
or
not
this
particular
matter
justifies
going
to
trial.
that’s
the
procedure
that’s
followed
in
california
at
the
present
time.
that’s
the
procedure
that
was
followed
in
this
case
contrary
to
the
suggestion
propounded
by
mr.
marks.
there
was
a
determination
by
the
trial
judge
shortly
after
the
arrest
of
this
case,
a
determination
that
this
was
not
constitutionally
protected
matter.
that
took
place
in
may
of
1969.
mr.
marks
attempted
to
appeal
that
to
the
appellate
department
of
our
superior
court
and
the
appellate
department
of
the
superior
court
concluded
that
the
trial
judge
was
correct
and
this
was
not
constitutionally
protected
matter
and
it
was
after
that
decision
by
the
appellate
department
of
the
orange
county,
california
superior
court
that
the
decision
of
the
l.a.
municipal
court
which
is
a
written
opinion
and
relied
upon
by
mr.
marks
was
signed,
so
if
there’s
a
doctrine
of
res
judicata
or
collateral
estoppel
that
applies
in
this
case,
if
the
initial
decision
was
the
judge
who
heard
that
matter
in
this
case
and
concluded
this
was
not
constitutionally
protected
material
and
the
trial
judge
in
los
angeles
county
should’ve
been
bound
by
that
determination
as
opposed
to
orange
county
being
bound
by
the
later
decision
of
the
l.a.
municipal
court
judge.
the
case
was
tried,
evidence
was
produced
and
the
jury
was
instructed
on
the
basis
of
a
statewide
standard
for
customary
limits
of
candor.
it
was
on
appeal
for
the
first
time
that
the
appellants
suggested
that
a
nationwide
standard
should
be
adopted
and
applied.
this
was
after
he
had
produced
evidence
and
concurred
an
instruction
to
the
jury
that
statewide
standard
should
be
applied.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
yes,
the
material
must
go
substantially
beyond
--
applying
contemporary
standards
must
go
substantially
beyond
customary
limits
of
candor.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
honesty,
frankness,
purity.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
yes,
as
to
all
allegedly
obscene
material,
that’s
the
test
that
is
applied
to
determine
whether
or
not
--
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
no.
i
think
it’s
a
term
that
is
exclusively
used
for
--
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
well,
it’s
a
phrase
that
is
enacted
by
statute
following
the
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
there
are
varying
definitions,
i
believe
propounded
by
the
dictionary.
purity
is
one
of
them.
frankness
is
but
one
definition
that
it
is
used.
however,
simply
because
someone
is
frank
or
honest
do
not
necessarily
insulate
that
conduct
of
speech
and
i
think
similarly
would
be
liable
if
it’s
done
maliciously
even
though
it
might
be
honest,
does
say
truthful.
it
suggests
that
the
constitution
does
not
require
that
a
nationwide
standard
be
adopted
if
were
to
say
that
the
limitation
of
states
is
through
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
implication
is
that
the
states
may
deprive
its
citizens
of
life,
liberty,
or
property
if
due
process
is
followed
or
complied
with
and
due
process
in
the
past
has
not
required
that
each
state
have
identical
laws
for
depriving
its
citizens
of
liberty.
the
different
states
provide
varying
types
of
conduct
as
criminal
and
it
seems
that
it
should
be
no
different
for
each
state
to
have
a
slightly
different
definition
as
to
what
constitutes
obscenity
than
it
is
to
have
a
slightly
different
definition
as
to
what
constitutes
burglary
or
any
other
crime.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
no
but
it
involves
conduct
and
it
involves
freedom
of
action
if
each
state
must
have
an
identical
definition
as
to
what
constitutes
obscenity,
how
can
we
avoid
the
conclusion
that
the
definition
of
any
crime
must
be
the
same
from
state
to
state
because
in
obscenity,
we’re
talking
about
the
freedom
of
speech.
in
any
other
sort
of
criminal
conduct,
we’re
talking
about
freedom
of
action
and
i’d
suggest
that
freedom
of
action
is
likewise
a
very,
very
basic
--
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
the
other
is
in
the
--
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
no,
but
freedom
--
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
no
but
freedom
to
do
what
we
wish
and
what
the
states
prescribed
certain
conduct
as
not
being
permissible
likewise
from
state
to
state
if
we’re
talking
about
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
should
we
not
have
different
definitions
as
to
what
constitutes
obscenity.
the
fact
that
--
well,
in
addition
to
the
constitutional
argument,
i’d
suggest
that
practicality
suggests
that
a
nationwide
standard
is
simply
not
possible.
in
denver,
the
dancers
wear
pasties
and
g-strings.
in
southern
california,
they
wear
nothing.
what
is
the
standard?
or
to
further
illustrate
it,
let’s
assume
for
the
sake
of
illustration
that
the
east
of
mississippi,
the
dancers
wear
pasties.
west
of
the
mississippi,
they
don’t
wear
pasties.
what
is
the
national
community
standard
for
limits
of
candor?
how
are
we
going
to
average
or
determine
something
that’s
not
subject
to
determination?
from
a
practical
point
of
view,
it
would
be
very
easy
for
the
appellant
of
this
case
to
determine
the
standard
in
the
various
localities,
much
easier
than
it
would
be
for
him
to
determine
the
standard
by
a
nationwide
basis.
the
whole
is
made
up
of
the
parts
and
while
the
parts
may
be
readily
identified,
simply
by
identifying
the
parts,
you
can’t
necessarily
arrive
at
a
description
as
to
what
the
whole
is.
if
we
were
to
adopt
something
that
was
acceptable
to
the
nation
as
a
whole,
we
would
probably
have
something
akin
to
what
we
see
on
tv,
something
that’s
acceptable
for
dissemination
indiscriminately
in
any
home
and
to
anyone
who
might
see
it
which
in
effect,
what
we
have
in
this
case.
it
was
mail
unsolicited
into
the
home
where
anyone
within
the
home
might
open
it
and
see
it.
thirdly,
i
would
suggest
with
relation
to
the
earlier
comments
that
judges
in
determining
obscenity
in
the
constitutional
sense
are
determining
a
question
of
law
and
the
local
judges
are
not
capable
of
determining
what
the
national
standard
for
limits
of
candor
is.
how
are
they
going
to
determine
what
the
limits
of
candor
nationwide
are?
experts
--
experts
may
define
it
for
the
trial
judge
but
if
we
have
conflicting
experts,
how
is
the
appellate
judge
to
resolve
the
conflict?
the
basic
principle
that
the
prior
fact
can
determine
credibility
because
he
used
the
witness
is
absent
when
the
appellate
judge
was
looking
at
the
whole
record.
further
as
attorneys
and
judges
and
i
think
it’s
easy
for
us
to
accept
the
proposition
that
speech
acceptable
in
one
location
is
not
acceptable
in
another.
we
describe
things
one
way
in
the
office
to
contemporaries,
partners
and
associates
which
description
if
use
in
court
would
probably
subject
us
to
contempt.
why?
if
location
is
not
important,
why
can’t
we
speak
the
same
way
in
the
courtroom
that
we
can
speak
in
the
office?
and
i
think
obviously
that
in
that
situation,
we
recognize
that
the
limits
of
candor,
honesty,
frankness
differs
from
place
to
place
because
we
have
two
different
communities
in
effect,
the
office
and
the
courtroom.
and
the
same
is
true
from
city
to
city,
county
to
county.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
no,
mr.
justice
marshall
but
we
use
different
terms
sometimes
to
describe
the
same
thing
in
court
than
we
do
in
chambers,
in
the
office
or
sometimes
other
court
and
i
think
the
reason
is
the
--
not
simply
a
question
of
honesty
because
both
descriptions
are
honest
and
frank
and
described
the
same
thing
but
it’s
the
language
that’s
used
is
acceptable
in
one
location
and
not
acceptable
in
another
location.
the
test
then
submitted
the
states
are
free
to
adopt
whichever
community
they
choose
whether
it
be
local,
state
or
national
for
determining
customary
limits
of
candor.
in
this
case,
the
state
chose
the
statewide
community
and
it’s
submitted
that
the
evidence
simply
established
that
community
was
--
the
standard
for
that
community
was
exceeded.
the
evidence
amply
established
that
the
material
predominantly
appealed
to
a
prurient
interest
and
although
mr.
marks
says,
he
hasn’t
seen
the
case
since
ginsberg
that
involve
pandering,
i
would
suggest
that
this
case
itself
may
be
very
well
involve
pandering.
these
were
brochures
containing
a
number
of
scenes
from
the
book
they
purported
to
advertise
and
very
little
of
the
text
of
the
book
is
there,
only
the
most
graphic
depictions
of
sexual
activity
selling
predominately
the
prurient
appeal
of
the
books
as
opposed
to
whatever
social
value
they
may
or
may
not
have.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
that’s
correct,
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
it’s
not,
i
would
concede.
it’s
extremely
difficult
to
establish.
in
adopting
a
statewide
standard,
the
state
court
said
that
expert
must
be
used
to
establish
what
that
standard
is
or
to
assist
the
prior
facts
in
determining
that
standard.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
it’s
possible.
although,
they
administered
an
oath
and
asked
to
follow
the
law
and
presumably,
they
do
follow
the
law.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
oh!
most
definitely.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
that’s
correct.
i’m
suggesting
that
the
constitution
does
not
make
that
standard
impermissible
and
the
constitution
would
likewise
permit
of
a
local
standard
if
the
law
of
that
state
indicated
a
local
standard.
in
other
words,
the
state
itself
is
just
free
to
adopt
a
standard
which
it
see
is
fit
and
neither
three
or
neither
of
the
three
standards,
local,
state
or
national
violate
the
constitution
that’s
applied
to
the
states
through
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
most
definitely.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
that’s
correct.
most
definitely
simply
because
the
expert
testifies
doesn’t
mean
the
jury
has
to
accept
that
which
he
relates
to
them,
if
he
just
believes
that
witness.
but
responding
further
to
the
question,
the
statewide
standard
is
difficult
to
determine
or
to
prove
or
to
provide
experts
on
the
extremely
difficult
a
nationwide
standard
requiring
experts
to
establish
would
be
virtually
impossible
to
do.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
maybe
just
left
to
juries
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
no
question
about
it.
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
that’s
the
nature
of
the
system.
that’s
correct.
further
with
respect
to
the
third
element
that’s
required
in
california
by
statute
and
that’s
the
issue
of
utterly
without
redeeming
social
importance,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
the
redeeming
aspect
of
social
importance
and
ask
that
that
not
be
treated
lightly
or
dropped
from
the
full
phrase.
it
seems
to
be
glossed
over
on
occasion
or
completely
eliminated
but
if
the
phrase
is
to
have
meeting
then
the
redeeming
aspect
of
utterly
without
redeeming
social
importance
must
be
emphasized.
everything
as
suggested
by
justice
white
has
some
value
to
society
whether
we
learn
from
it
hopefully
and
if
that
is
the
test
strictly
social
importance
or
social
value
then
nothing
is
going
to
be
obscene
but
we
must
have
--
it
must
be
utterly
without
redeeming
social
importance.
i
would
ask
that
the
court
reject
the
necessity
of
determining
obscenity
in
a
constitutional
sense
on
a
piece-by-piece
basis
and
adopt
a
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
test
as
hide
in
other
cases.
no
matter
which
test
is
adopted,
submitted
that
the
material
in
this
case
is
patently
offensive
and
substantially
exceeds
any
conceivable
standards
or
limits
of
candor
and
for
that
reason,
we
submit
the
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
