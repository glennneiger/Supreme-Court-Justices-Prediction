mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
by
the
united
states
from
a
decision
of
the
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois
in
a
civil
antitrust
case.
the
appellee,
defendant
in
the
district
court
is
topco
associates
inc.
topco
is
a
cooperative
corporation,
which
procures
grocery
and
related
nonfood
products
for
23
supermarket
chains
and
two
wholesalers.
these
chains
and
wholesalers
are
owner
members
of
the
corporation
and
they
control
it.
the
restriction
challenged
by
the
government
is
an
agreement
among
the
member
chains
through
topco
that
they
will
not
retail
topco
branded
products
outside
of
specified
territories
and
that
they
will
not
sell
topco
supply
products
at
wholesale.
the
government
contended
in
the
district
court
that
the
arrangement
was
a
horizontal
territorial
allocation
scheme,
which
was
illegal
per
se
under
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
after
a
trial
on
the
merits,
the
district
court
held
that
the
act
had
not
been
violated
and
entered
judgment
for
the
defendant.
in
its
opinion
which
is
at
page
545
of
the
record
and
its
findings
of
fact,
which
are
at
page
553;
it
concluded
that
the
division
of
territories
among
topco
supermarket
chains
and
the
accompanying
wholesale
restrictions
were
not
illegal
per
se.
rather
the
court
ruled
they
were
reasonable
restrictions
ancillary
to
the
cooperative
private
label
program,
topco
furnishes
its
owner
members.
i
would
like
briefly
to
describe
the
topco
organization.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
correct
your
honor.
the
topco
organization,
as
i
said
procures
food
and
related
and
nonfood
grocery
items.
about
55%
of
these
are
furnished
to
the
members
under
brand
names
which
are
owned
by
topco.
these
brand
names
are
not
nationally
advertised.
they
are
such
names
as
food
club
which
is
the
top
line
for
canned
goods;
elna
which
is
a
second
line,
gallo
which
i
think
covers
carbonated
beverages,
top
frost
and
so
on.
they
include
the
primarily
strategic
grocery
items.
there
are
canned
goods,
frozen
foods,
carbonated
beverages,
cookies
and
crackers.
they
are
sold
outright
to
the
members
so
that
the
member
grocery
chains
had
absolute
title
to
them.
now,
topco’s
member
grocery
chains
are
independent
business
entities.
they
have
simply
joined
together
through
topco
for
the
purpose
of
procuring
these
products.
topco
has
managed
much
in
the
same
way
that
the
sealy
corporation
was
managed
in
united
states
against
sealy.
voting
stock
is
held
equally
by
each
member
chain
and
the
business
of
the
corporation
is
conducted
by
14-man
board
of
directors,
made
up
of
officials
who
are
selected
from
among
the
chief
executive
officers
of
the
member
chains.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no,
your
honor,
they
are
not.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
the
topco
member
chains
are,
as
i
said,
independent
organizations
and
that
their
combined
retail
sales
in
1967
were
$2.3
billion,
so
that
the
25
topco
organizations
are
fourth
in
retail
sales
after
a&p,
safeway
and
kroger.
many
of
the
chains
are
very
substantial
in
our
local
market.
giant
foods
was
a
member
of
topco,
for
example,
from
1960
to
1966
and
it
had
23%
of
the
district
of
columbia
market.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
out
of
the
$2.3
billion
in
total
sales,
about
10%
is
topco
supplied
products,
237
million
and
about
133
million
of
that
would
be
topco
brand
products,
your
honor.
i
started
to
describe
the
size
of
these
organizations,
which
we
maintain
is
quite
substantial.
the
record
at
a17
through
25
describes
them
9
members
have
total
sales
in
excess
each
of
100
million
and
20,
according
to
my
count,
have
sales
in
excess
of
50
million.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
i
think
not
of
national
label
products,
they
may
buy
a
few,
but
there
are
great
many
non-branded
goods.
it
does
purchase
some
branded
goods,
which
are
not
topco
brands.
as
i
have
say,
the
division
seems
to
break
down
to
about
102.5
million
of
non
topco
branded
products.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
correct.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
the
crux
of
the
government's
case.
the
topco
organization
licenses
each
member
and
in
terms
of
the
licensee,
you
may
not
sell
the
branded
goods,
you
are
authorized
to
sell
outside
of
specified
territories.
actually,
there
are
three
kinds
of
licenses.
one
is
exclusive,
the
other
is
non-exclusive
and
the
third
is
called
co-extensive,
but
in
effect,
as
the
district
court
found,
they
add
up
to
exclusive.
in
fact
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
the
remedy
which
is
it
to
enjoin
the
territorialization
and
the
wholesale
restriction.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor,
the
injunction
would
run
against
the
restrictive
term
in
topco’s
bylaws
which
require
this
territorialization.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
it
appears
in
the
record
that
at
appendix
395
and
398.
the
description
of
the
restraint
itself,
the
licensing
arrangement
itself
is
in
paragraph
2
of
article
xi
of
the
topco
bylaws,
and
the
wholesale
restriction,
which
is
a
supplementary
restriction
to
the
territorial
restriction,
is
described
in
paragraph
8
of
article
xi
on
appendix
(a)
398.
very
briefly
it
is,
“no
member
will
sell
or
offer
for
sale
any
products
bearing
any
of
the
association’s
trademarks
at
any
point
outside
the
territory,
which
has
been
specifically
assigned
to
them
and
then
the
wholesale
restriction,
would
follow,
that
is
what
we
are
challenging.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
in
order
to
expand
his
territory,
he
had
to
get
the
consent
of
the
topco
organization,
which
of
course
consists
of
its
fellow
chains.
if
he
runs
into
the
territory
of
another,
he
is
subject
to
a
veto
in
effect.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
if
the
topco
organization
is
not
licensed
to
territory
it
will
be
open.
occasionally,
there
are
clashes
over
a
territory,
but
territory
is
quite
large,
they
are
defined
by
county
and
some
of
them
include
very
substantial
segments
of
states.
the
district
court
found
that
in
practice,
the
consent
of
the
incumbent
in
any
territory
is
needed
for
a
chain
to
enter.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
there
is
a
map
at
the
back
of
appellee’s
brief,
which
sets
forth
the
areas,
in
which
topco
operates.
i
think
it
covered
some
33
states
which
makes
it
comparable
to
organizations
like
a&p,
which
operates,
i
think
in
about
37
states
or
safeway
which
may
operate
in
about
30.
there
is
no
question
as
to
the
purpose
of
the
restrictions,
the
purpose
of
the
territorialization
and
the
wholesale
restrictions,
which
supplement
them,
are
to
protect
the
members
from
each
others
competition
in
the
sale
of
topco
branded
products,
that
is
why
you
have
an
exclusive
arrangement
like
this.
and,
it
was
the
government’s
position
in
the
district
court,
it
is
the
government’s
position
here
that
this
kind
of
arrangement
affected
through
this
of
its
kind
of
an
organization
is
a
horizontal
agreement
to
allocate
territories
and
to
restrict
wholesale
operations,
which
is
illegal
per
se
and
has
been
illegal
per
se,
ever
since
the
addyston
pipe
case,
70
years
ago.
if
this
was
a
vertical
restriction,
arguably
it
might
be
a
different
case,
although
even
there,
i
think
the
law
is
now
clear
that
a
vertical
restriction
on
products
which
are
sold
to
a
business
for
resale
and
are
owned
by
it
cannot
be
imposed
even
vertically.
and
a
fortiori,
when
you
have
it
horizontal
as
you
do
this
case,
by
there
is
an
agreement
among
direct
and
actual
and
potential
competitors,
it
has
to
be
illegal
per
se.
the
district
court
relied
particularly
in
its
decision
on
the
sixth
circuit’s
ruling
in
federal
trade
commission
against
sandura
company
in
339
f.
2d
847,
yet
that
was
a
vertical
case
and
in
that
case,
the
sixth
circuit
pointed
out
that
if
the
arrangement
before
it
had
been
a
horizontal
arrangement
as
this
is,
then
it
would
have
been
illegal
per
se.
now,
i
call
it
horizontal
because
this
organization
is
almost
identical
in
its
operation
to
the
operation
in
united
states
against
sealy.
when
you
put
the
sealy
case
together
with
the
ruling
in
united
states
against
schwinn
company,
which
also
involved
a
territorial
restriction,
you
come
up
with
a
plain
rule
that
it
is
illegal
per
se.
we
think
the
district
court
should
have
stopped
right
there.
it
did
not.
it
went
on
to
say
that
this
kind
of
territorialization
is
reasonable,
even
though
is
among
actual
and
potential
competitors
because
without
competition
from
each
other,
each
member
would
better
be
able
to
control
the
pricing
and
merchandising
of
topco
goods
and
thus,
would
better
be
able
to
compete
with
the
vertically
integrated
chains,
such
a&p,
kroger
and
safeway.
the
argument
was
that
these
organizations,
a&p,
safeway
and
kroger
are
able
through
vertical
integration
to
have
exclusive
private
brand,
that
is
private
brands
that
they
do
not
sell
to
anybody
else.
so,
what
the
topco
organization
was
permitted
to
do
by
the
district
court
was
to
agree
among
themselves
not
to
compete,
so
that
they
could
have
exclusive
private
brands
and
the
only
way
they
could
achieve
that
exclusivity,
however,
was
by
horizontal
agreement
among
themselves.
that
is
the
justification,
which
is
said
to
take
this
case
outside
the
per
se
rule.
our
objection
is
not
to
exclusivity
as
such
with
respect
to
a
brand
nor
is
it
to
the
combination
of
chains
into
a
single
buying
organization
to
achieve
useful
economies
of
scale.
what
we
object
to
is
the
attempt
to
achieve
exclusivity
by
an
agreement
not
to
compete
among
their
actual
and
potential
competitors.
now,
when
the
district
court
sought
to
justify
this
arrangement,
it
said
that
the
government
had
conceded
that
the
topco
arrangements
enabled
topco
members
to
compete
better.
we
did
not
make
such
a
concession.
in
our
post-trial
brief
we
said,
while
it
may
be
true
as
the
defendant
contends
that
these
unlawful
agreements
are
intended
to
enable
the
member
chains
to
more
effectively
compete
with
others
in
the
marketplace,
this
motive
does
not
immunize
defendant’s
conduct.
instead,
what
we
urged
in
the
district
court
was
that,
the
law
just
does
not
allow
direct
agreement
among
competitors
as
a
means
of
counterbalancing
the
power
or
advantages
of
somebody
else
in
the
marketplace.
the
same
argument
was
made
in
the
schwinn
case,
where
it
was
said,
let
us
have
territorialization,
so
that
our
dealers
in
trademark
bicycles
can
better
compete
with
the
mass
merchandisers.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
it
would
depend
on
the
type
of
license,
which
was
given.
if
7-eleven
and
giant,
both
had
--
they
had
to
have
a
co-extensive
or
non-exclusive
license
to
compete
in
the
same
area
and
it
is
unlikely
that
you
would
have
that
kind
of
arrangement,
because
the
topco
members
have
quite
insistent
that
they
not
have
competition
from
somebody
else
in
the
sale
of
topco
brands.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no,
your
honor.
i
think
we
have
to
concerned
with
the
non-exclusive
and
the
co-extensive
license
also
because
all
of
them
involve
some
kind
of
arrangement
in
which
the
members
of
the
organization,
as
competitors
get
together
and
say
well,
we
either
let
this
guy
in
or
we
would
not
let
him
in,
i
should
not
use
that
kind
of
language,
but
it
really
amounts
to
that.
what
they
say
is,
is
this
area
adequately
covered
to
promote
the
sale
of
topco
brands
and
if
they
say
it
is,
then
they
agree
to
give
an
exclusive.
if
they
have
doubt
that
it
is
adequately
covered,
then
they
will
say
no.
we
would
not
give
an
exclusive.
we
will
allow
more
than
one
chain
to
handle.
usually
in
the
situation,
where
the
chains
are
not
directly
bumping
into
each
other,
their
object
is
to
keep
competition
away,
that
is
the
whole
purpose
of
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
i
doubt
very
much
that
7-eleven
and
giant
would
both
--
have
been
licensed
at
the
same
time.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no,
we
do
not,
your
honor.
our
position
on
that
was
stated
quite
clearly.
the
topco
organization
furnishes
its
members
very
valuable
economies
of
scale
in
purchasing
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
not
only
it
is
attractive,
your
honor,
it
is
necessary.
in
fact,
dr.
barnes
(ph)
the
expert
that
the
defendants
put
on
said
that
they
would
incur
the
--
the
members
would
incur
across
many
times
across
topco,
they
did
not
have
it.
now,
if
they
were
freed
from
agreements
not
to
compete;
it
is
quite
possible
that
they
could
still
achieve
some
of
the
benefits
of
individual
labeling.
for
example,
by
using
its
joint
organization
to
achieve
brands
for
each
of
them,
that
way
they
might
achieve
exclusivity
without
having
territorial
barriers
to
each
other.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
now,
you
got
it.
just
carrying
on
with
your
honor’s
question
for
a
moment,
topco
itself
sells
to
two
wholesalers.
one
of
them,
frankford
quaker
is
a
large
pennsylvania
wholesaler
and
it
obtains
supplies
from
topco
under
its
own
brand,
the
unity
brand.
in
another
instance,
topco
now
supplies
the
twin
forks
grocery
company,
this
is
a
large
wholesaler,
operating
up
in
delft
and
superior.
the
members
up
there
compete
in
the
grocery-supermarket
business
and
we
--
the
record
shows
that
topco
members
have
competed
with
each
other
in
the
sale
of
topco
products,
without
disastrous
results.
we
have
newspaper
advertisings
in
the
records
of
exhibits
115
to
132
that
show
that
fred
meyer
up
in
spokane,
washington
furnishes
topco
products
at
wholesale
to
groceries
who
compete
with
its
own
spokane,
washington
stores.
perhaps,
the
most
dramatic
example
i
can
give
of
this
is
the
instance
in
michigan.
there,
there
were
two
stores
that
had
a
coextensive
license,
plumbs
and
meijers.
one
of
them
--
they
both
entered
each
other’s
prime
territory,
as
the
phrase
is
used,
because
they
did
not
have
exclusive
licenses.
well,
meijers'
witness
testified
in
this
case
that
they
ended
up
competing
all
over
the
place
and
yet
the
meijers'
revenues
rose
in
that
area.
the
witness
explained
this
by
saying,
well,
sometimes
you
get
so
mad
and
work
so
hard
that
you
run
pass
yourself.
well,
this
is
what
we
think
the
sherman
act
is
about
and
this
is
what
the
per
se
prohibition
against
market
division
can
achieve.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no,
we
did
not.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
your
honor,
our
position
would
remain
that
if
topco
has
--
in
order
to
compete
and
engage
in
horizontal
territorialization,
you
have
to
give
up
topco
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
this
goes
to
the
reasons
for
having
per
se
rules.
one
of
the
assumptions
is
that
in
most
instances
horizontal
territorialization
is
just
going
to
be
extremely
harmful.
now,
once
in
a
while
a
case
may
come
along
in
which
that
is
not
so,
but
even
if
that
is
true,
you
still
apply
the
per
se
rule,
because
you
need
the
benefits
of
predictability.
right
now,
any
antitrust
lawyer
in
the
country
can
tell
a
supermarket
chain.
you
may
not
divide
up
territories
with
your
competitors.
the
law
is
absolutely
clear
on
it.
now,
along
comes
this
case,
which
says
you
will
find
out
whether
you
can
divide
up
territory
after
the
trial
because
we
will
go
through
a
full
scale
rule
of
re-examination.
now,
rule
of
re-examination
in
this
kind
of
case
is
extremely
difficult.
this
is
a
case
in
which
you
have
some
65
different
geographic
markets
involved.
the
district
court
tried
to
say,
well,
we
have
to
balance
a&p’s
interests
against
or
a&p’s
market
position
against
the
topco
member's
position,
and
yet
you
find
nothing
in
the
record
showing
what
a&p’s
position
is
in
these
65
markets.
it
is
almost
impossible
to
do
that
kind
of
vast
market
analysis.
instead,
the
district
court
tried
to
make
findings
as
to
market
shares,
based
on
the
market
areas,
in
which
these
firms
did
business
on
some
kind
of
average
basis
and
the
results
are
very
inaccurate.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
oh!
no,
your
honor.
it
is
not
simply
a
matter
of
the
government's
convenience
of
proof,
but
of
predictability
and
certainty
in
anti
trust
law
and
on
judicial
--
effective
judicial
administration,
as
well.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
it
is
one
of
the
factors
and
the
other
major
factor,
of
course,
your
honor
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
oh!
standing
alone,
it
would
not
be,
of
course.
the
factor
is
that
in
almost
every
instance
horizontal
territorialization
carries
adverse
effects
and
it
does
here.
we
think
there
are
at
least
three
things
we
can
point
to
that
a
company
of
this
kind
of
territorialization.
first,
the
territorialization
here
inhibits
expansion
by
the
members
into
each
other’s
territory.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
the
district
court
felt
that
the
public
would
be
disadvantaged
if
topco
were
to
dissolve.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
i
think
that
the
topco
organization
does
achieve
very
useful
and
beneficial
economies
of
scale
and
advantages
in
distribution
for
its
members.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
there
are
means
of
combining
group
buying
power
without
territorialization.
i
think
that
is
the
answer
that
has
to
be
given.
nobody,
as
far
as
we
know,
at
the
retail
level
uses
territorialization,
except
topco.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record,
no
testimony
by
either
expert
that
suggests
that
any
one
else
uses
horizontal
territorialization.
i
would
like
to
save
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
government’s
argument
has
been
that
the
competition
is
not
enhanced
by
the
territorialization
device
for
achieving
exclusivity.
in
very
brief
terms,
what
we
are
saying
is
that
it
is
better
to
have
two
topco
members
competing
against
a&p
in
a
given
market
or
kroger
or
safeway
than
one.
we
do
not
enhance
competition
by
erecting
a
barrier
around
the
market.
secondly,
we
have
argued
that
we
do
have
here
an
effect
on
price.
topco’s
expert
dr.
applebaum
(ph)
explained
the
whole
purpose
of
exclusivity
is
to
insulate
the
seller
from
competition
with
respect
to
price
and
try
and
get
as
much
control
over
price
and
margin
as
you
can.
so
that
exclusivity
itself
has
an
effect
on
price
and
when
exclusivity
is
achieved
by
territorial
agreements
not
to
compete,
that
effect
is
aggravated
because
we
have
the
third
consequence
of
this
agreement,
namely
something
that
inhibits
entry
into
each
others
markets.
now,
it
is
argued
that
well
there
really
is
not
any
inhibition
on
entry
into
markets.
people
can
enter
without
topco
products.
of
course,
they
can
enter
without
topco
products,
as
is
suggested
and
the
justification
for
the
importance
of
topco
is
not
as
great
as
it
has
been
suggested,
but
the
record
is
to
the
contrary.
just
to
use
the
exhibit
that
was
referred
to
a
moment
ago
at
page
440,
there,
there
is
the
discussion
of
the
second
line
of
products
and
it
is
also
pointed
out
that
at
page
438
and
439,
one
of
the
reasons
that
there
is
not
a
demand
for
second
line,
doubtless
rises
from
the
fact
that
it
is
impracticable
to
stock
in
the
same
warehouse,
duplicating
private
brand
inventories.
now,
this
really
means
that
once
you
are
into
the
topco
system
of
distribution,
so
that
it
is
your
basic
system,
anywhere
where
you
are
operating
out
of
your
basic
warehouses,
you
really
cannot
go
to
some
other
line,
if
you
want
to
expand
and
that
means
you
cannot
walk
into
another
topco
member's
territory
with
a
different
line
and
in
fact,
that
same
paragraph
illustrates
the
kind
of
conflict
we
run
into
here.
the
big
bear
liberal
situation
where
neither
wanted
to
give
up
the
brands
that
the
other
--
the
exclusivity,
but
and
neither
one
of
the
other
member
having
the
advantages
of
the
same
brand.
now,
this
goes
also
to
the
second
line.
if
you
look
at
page
440,
the
explanation
is
given
why
would
not
members
want
a
second
line
of
brands
and
the
answer
is
that
if
there
were
a
second
line,
the
competitive
edge
that
topco
members
gives
--
the
topco
programs
give
its
members
would
be
eliminated,
that
is
the
competitive
edge
they
have
against
each
other.
now,
the
district
court
found
expressly
a
third
factor,
finding
at
58
in
a
record
at
a56,
it
expressly
found
that
intra
brand
competition
is
eliminated.
there
was
nothing
else
it
could
find
on
this
record.
there
has
been
some
mention
here
about
the
importance
of
brand
loyalty
as
a
competitive
factor
here.
now,
the
record
on
brand
loyalty
is
that
no
one
can
determine
what
it
is
that
brings
the
housewife
in.
it
certainly
is
not
just
loyalty
to
a
private
label
brand.
people
do
not
travel
across
the
city
to
get
food
club
canned
peas.
dr.
barnes,
i
mean,
dr.
applebaum,
the
expert
put
on
by
the
defendants
testified
that
the
brand
loyalty
factor
really
cannot
be
determined
because
there
are
not
studies
available
to
do
so,
this
is
in
the
record
of
186
and
187.
a
point
has
been
made
that
the
government
did
not
specifically
attempt
to
prove
that
this
practice
was
anti-competitive
and
we
did
not
go
forward
with
evidence
beyond
enough
to
show
that
this
was
illegal
per
se.
we
did,
however,
on
the
record
that
was
made
try
to
carry
the
burden
to
show
that
this
practice
was
not
unreasonable
and
we
argued
principally
three
things
that
it
inhibits
expansion
by
members
into
each
others
territory,
that
it
affects
price
and
that
it
restricts
intra
brand
competition.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
let
us
suppose
that
we
had
in
the
same
market
--
let
me
give
the
example
that
i
referred
to
a
moment
ago,
the
situation
in
michigan.
two
topco
stores
meijers
and
plumbs
both
entered
each
others
territory,
grand
rapids,
muskegon
and
i
think
in
lansing
and
they
began
vigorously
competing
with
each
other.
they
were
necessarily
vigorously
competing
with
a&p,
as
well
and
the
result
is
--
the
result
for
meijers
was
very,
very
good,
because
meijers
ended
up
the
winner
in
that
contest
with
a
very
substantial
market
share.
that
is
really
what
it
boils
down
to.
with
this
system,
you
do
not
get
two
topco
members
competing
in
one
market,
they
get
one
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
this
was
price
competition.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
the
plumbs
and
meijers
were
competing
on
topco
brands.
they
handled
the
entire
line
together.
they
were
competing
all
over
the
place,
in
the
witness’
words.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
now,
we
do
not
agree
that
topco
would
collapse.
there
are
just
too
many
other
advantages
as
the
witness
has
testified,
particularly
dr.
barnes,
who
emphasized
these
very
substantial
advantages
that
the
topco
organization
had.
it
is
a
good
organization.
they
offer
very
good
buying
services.
i
think
one
witness
from
hillmans
to
described
them
as
a,
“we
use
them
like
our
own
buying
division”
and
they
have
very
excellent
quality
control
services
and
incidentally
it
would
not
have
to
develop
26
different
brands.
they
might
achieve
some
real
wonders
with
a
smaller
line
in
26,
for
each
store.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
may
i
qualify
it?
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
we
are
not
trying
to
stop
exclusivity.
we
are
trying
to
stop
the
achievement
of
exclusivity
by
territorial
agreement
and
wholesale
restriction
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
--
and
there
is
a
very
important
difference
(voice
overlap)
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
by
agreement
between
competitors,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
they
do
your
honor,
but
they
achieve
it
because
they
are
a
single
economic
and
legal
unit.
they
are
--
the
law
has
always
looked
differently
at
attempts
between
independent
firms
to
make
agreements,
but
not
to
compete
among
each
and
situations
where
a
single
firm
managing
its
own
affair,
restricts
competition
with
itself.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
oh!
yes,
your
honor
and
that
was
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
there
are
other
--
there
are
less
restrictive
means,
let
us
put
it,
which
is
really
what
the
ancillary
restriction
was
about.
there
are
less
restrictive
means
by
which
it
can
be
done,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
by
the
united
states
from
a
decision
of
the
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois
in
a
civil
antitrust
case.
the
appellee,
defendant
in
the
district
court
is
topco
associates
inc.
topco
is
a
cooperative
corporation,
which
procures
grocery
and
related
nonfood
products
for
23
supermarket
chains
and
two
wholesalers.
these
chains
and
wholesalers
are
owner
members
of
the
corporation
and
they
control
it.
the
restriction
challenged
by
the
government
is
an
agreement
among
the
member
chains
through
topco
that
they
will
not
retail
topco
branded
products
outside
of
specified
territories
and
that
they
will
not
sell
topco
supply
products
at
wholesale.
the
government
contended
in
the
district
court
that
the
arrangement
was
a
horizontal
territorial
allocation
scheme,
which
was
illegal
per
se
under
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
after
a
trial
on
the
merits,
the
district
court
held
that
the
act
had
not
been
violated
and
entered
judgment
for
the
defendant.
in
its
opinion
which
is
at
page
545
of
the
record
and
its
findings
of
fact,
which
are
at
page
553;
it
concluded
that
the
division
of
territories
among
topco
supermarket
chains
and
the
accompanying
wholesale
restrictions
were
not
illegal
per
se.
rather
the
court
ruled
they
were
reasonable
restrictions
ancillary
to
the
cooperative
private
label
program,
topco
furnishes
its
owner
members.
i
would
like
briefly
to
describe
the
topco
organization.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
correct
your
honor.
the
topco
organization,
as
i
said
procures
food
and
related
and
nonfood
grocery
items.
about
55%
of
these
are
furnished
to
the
members
under
brand
names
which
are
owned
by
topco.
these
brand
names
are
not
nationally
advertised.
they
are
such
names
as
food
club
which
is
the
top
line
for
canned
goods;
elna
which
is
a
second
line,
gallo
which
i
think
covers
carbonated
beverages,
top
frost
and
so
on.
they
include
the
primarily
strategic
grocery
items.
there
are
canned
goods,
frozen
foods,
carbonated
beverages,
cookies
and
crackers.
they
are
sold
outright
to
the
members
so
that
the
member
grocery
chains
had
absolute
title
to
them.
now,
topco’s
member
grocery
chains
are
independent
business
entities.
they
have
simply
joined
together
through
topco
for
the
purpose
of
procuring
these
products.
topco
has
managed
much
in
the
same
way
that
the
sealy
corporation
was
managed
in
united
states
against
sealy.
voting
stock
is
held
equally
by
each
member
chain
and
the
business
of
the
corporation
is
conducted
by
14-man
board
of
directors,
made
up
of
officials
who
are
selected
from
among
the
chief
executive
officers
of
the
member
chains.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no,
your
honor,
they
are
not.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
the
topco
member
chains
are,
as
i
said,
independent
organizations
and
that
their
combined
retail
sales
in
1967
were
$2.3
billion,
so
that
the
25
topco
organizations
are
fourth
in
retail
sales
after
a&p,
safeway
and
kroger.
many
of
the
chains
are
very
substantial
in
our
local
market.
giant
foods
was
a
member
of
topco,
for
example,
from
1960
to
1966
and
it
had
23%
of
the
district
of
columbia
market.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
out
of
the
$2.3
billion
in
total
sales,
about
10%
is
topco
supplied
products,
237
million
and
about
133
million
of
that
would
be
topco
brand
products,
your
honor.
i
started
to
describe
the
size
of
these
organizations,
which
we
maintain
is
quite
substantial.
the
record
at
a17
through
25
describes
them
9
members
have
total
sales
in
excess
each
of
100
million
and
20,
according
to
my
count,
have
sales
in
excess
of
50
million.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
i
think
not
of
national
label
products,
they
may
buy
a
few,
but
there
are
great
many
non-branded
goods.
it
does
purchase
some
branded
goods,
which
are
not
topco
brands.
as
i
have
say,
the
division
seems
to
break
down
to
about
102.5
million
of
non
topco
branded
products.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
correct.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
the
crux
of
the
government's
case.
the
topco
organization
licenses
each
member
and
in
terms
of
the
licensee,
you
may
not
sell
the
branded
goods,
you
are
authorized
to
sell
outside
of
specified
territories.
actually,
there
are
three
kinds
of
licenses.
one
is
exclusive,
the
other
is
non-exclusive
and
the
third
is
called
co-extensive,
but
in
effect,
as
the
district
court
found,
they
add
up
to
exclusive.
in
fact
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
the
remedy
which
is
it
to
enjoin
the
territorialization
and
the
wholesale
restriction.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor,
the
injunction
would
run
against
the
restrictive
term
in
topco’s
bylaws
which
require
this
territorialization.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
it
appears
in
the
record
that
at
appendix
395
and
398.
the
description
of
the
restraint
itself,
the
licensing
arrangement
itself
is
in
paragraph
2
of
article
xi
of
the
topco
bylaws,
and
the
wholesale
restriction,
which
is
a
supplementary
restriction
to
the
territorial
restriction,
is
described
in
paragraph
8
of
article
xi
on
appendix
(a)
398.
very
briefly
it
is,
“no
member
will
sell
or
offer
for
sale
any
products
bearing
any
of
the
association’s
trademarks
at
any
point
outside
the
territory,
which
has
been
specifically
assigned
to
them
and
then
the
wholesale
restriction,
would
follow,
that
is
what
we
are
challenging.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
in
order
to
expand
his
territory,
he
had
to
get
the
consent
of
the
topco
organization,
which
of
course
consists
of
its
fellow
chains.
if
he
runs
into
the
territory
of
another,
he
is
subject
to
a
veto
in
effect.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
if
the
topco
organization
is
not
licensed
to
territory
it
will
be
open.
occasionally,
there
are
clashes
over
a
territory,
but
territory
is
quite
large,
they
are
defined
by
county
and
some
of
them
include
very
substantial
segments
of
states.
the
district
court
found
that
in
practice,
the
consent
of
the
incumbent
in
any
territory
is
needed
for
a
chain
to
enter.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
there
is
a
map
at
the
back
of
appellee’s
brief,
which
sets
forth
the
areas,
in
which
topco
operates.
i
think
it
covered
some
33
states
which
makes
it
comparable
to
organizations
like
a&p,
which
operates,
i
think
in
about
37
states
or
safeway
which
may
operate
in
about
30.
there
is
no
question
as
to
the
purpose
of
the
restrictions,
the
purpose
of
the
territorialization
and
the
wholesale
restrictions,
which
supplement
them,
are
to
protect
the
members
from
each
others
competition
in
the
sale
of
topco
branded
products,
that
is
why
you
have
an
exclusive
arrangement
like
this.
and,
it
was
the
government’s
position
in
the
district
court,
it
is
the
government’s
position
here
that
this
kind
of
arrangement
affected
through
this
of
its
kind
of
an
organization
is
a
horizontal
agreement
to
allocate
territories
and
to
restrict
wholesale
operations,
which
is
illegal
per
se
and
has
been
illegal
per
se,
ever
since
the
addyston
pipe
case,
70
years
ago.
if
this
was
a
vertical
restriction,
arguably
it
might
be
a
different
case,
although
even
there,
i
think
the
law
is
now
clear
that
a
vertical
restriction
on
products
which
are
sold
to
a
business
for
resale
and
are
owned
by
it
cannot
be
imposed
even
vertically.
and
a
fortiori,
when
you
have
it
horizontal
as
you
do
this
case,
by
there
is
an
agreement
among
direct
and
actual
and
potential
competitors,
it
has
to
be
illegal
per
se.
the
district
court
relied
particularly
in
its
decision
on
the
sixth
circuit’s
ruling
in
federal
trade
commission
against
sandura
company
in
339
f.
2d
847,
yet
that
was
a
vertical
case
and
in
that
case,
the
sixth
circuit
pointed
out
that
if
the
arrangement
before
it
had
been
a
horizontal
arrangement
as
this
is,
then
it
would
have
been
illegal
per
se.
now,
i
call
it
horizontal
because
this
organization
is
almost
identical
in
its
operation
to
the
operation
in
united
states
against
sealy.
when
you
put
the
sealy
case
together
with
the
ruling
in
united
states
against
schwinn
company,
which
also
involved
a
territorial
restriction,
you
come
up
with
a
plain
rule
that
it
is
illegal
per
se.
we
think
the
district
court
should
have
stopped
right
there.
it
did
not.
it
went
on
to
say
that
this
kind
of
territorialization
is
reasonable,
even
though
is
among
actual
and
potential
competitors
because
without
competition
from
each
other,
each
member
would
better
be
able
to
control
the
pricing
and
merchandising
of
topco
goods
and
thus,
would
better
be
able
to
compete
with
the
vertically
integrated
chains,
such
a&p,
kroger
and
safeway.
the
argument
was
that
these
organizations,
a&p,
safeway
and
kroger
are
able
through
vertical
integration
to
have
exclusive
private
brand,
that
is
private
brands
that
they
do
not
sell
to
anybody
else.
so,
what
the
topco
organization
was
permitted
to
do
by
the
district
court
was
to
agree
among
themselves
not
to
compete,
so
that
they
could
have
exclusive
private
brands
and
the
only
way
they
could
achieve
that
exclusivity,
however,
was
by
horizontal
agreement
among
themselves.
that
is
the
justification,
which
is
said
to
take
this
case
outside
the
per
se
rule.
our
objection
is
not
to
exclusivity
as
such
with
respect
to
a
brand
nor
is
it
to
the
combination
of
chains
into
a
single
buying
organization
to
achieve
useful
economies
of
scale.
what
we
object
to
is
the
attempt
to
achieve
exclusivity
by
an
agreement
not
to
compete
among
their
actual
and
potential
competitors.
now,
when
the
district
court
sought
to
justify
this
arrangement,
it
said
that
the
government
had
conceded
that
the
topco
arrangements
enabled
topco
members
to
compete
better.
we
did
not
make
such
a
concession.
in
our
post-trial
brief
we
said,
while
it
may
be
true
as
the
defendant
contends
that
these
unlawful
agreements
are
intended
to
enable
the
member
chains
to
more
effectively
compete
with
others
in
the
marketplace,
this
motive
does
not
immunize
defendant’s
conduct.
instead,
what
we
urged
in
the
district
court
was
that,
the
law
just
does
not
allow
direct
agreement
among
competitors
as
a
means
of
counterbalancing
the
power
or
advantages
of
somebody
else
in
the
marketplace.
the
same
argument
was
made
in
the
schwinn
case,
where
it
was
said,
let
us
have
territorialization,
so
that
our
dealers
in
trademark
bicycles
can
better
compete
with
the
mass
merchandisers.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
it
would
depend
on
the
type
of
license,
which
was
given.
if
7-eleven
and
giant,
both
had
--
they
had
to
have
a
co-extensive
or
non-exclusive
license
to
compete
in
the
same
area
and
it
is
unlikely
that
you
would
have
that
kind
of
arrangement,
because
the
topco
members
have
quite
insistent
that
they
not
have
competition
from
somebody
else
in
the
sale
of
topco
brands.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no,
your
honor.
i
think
we
have
to
concerned
with
the
non-exclusive
and
the
co-extensive
license
also
because
all
of
them
involve
some
kind
of
arrangement
in
which
the
members
of
the
organization,
as
competitors
get
together
and
say
well,
we
either
let
this
guy
in
or
we
would
not
let
him
in,
i
should
not
use
that
kind
of
language,
but
it
really
amounts
to
that.
what
they
say
is,
is
this
area
adequately
covered
to
promote
the
sale
of
topco
brands
and
if
they
say
it
is,
then
they
agree
to
give
an
exclusive.
if
they
have
doubt
that
it
is
adequately
covered,
then
they
will
say
no.
we
would
not
give
an
exclusive.
we
will
allow
more
than
one
chain
to
handle.
usually
in
the
situation,
where
the
chains
are
not
directly
bumping
into
each
other,
their
object
is
to
keep
competition
away,
that
is
the
whole
purpose
of
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
i
doubt
very
much
that
7-eleven
and
giant
would
both
--
have
been
licensed
at
the
same
time.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no,
we
do
not,
your
honor.
our
position
on
that
was
stated
quite
clearly.
the
topco
organization
furnishes
its
members
very
valuable
economies
of
scale
in
purchasing
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
not
only
it
is
attractive,
your
honor,
it
is
necessary.
in
fact,
dr.
barnes
(ph)
the
expert
that
the
defendants
put
on
said
that
they
would
incur
the
--
the
members
would
incur
across
many
times
across
topco,
they
did
not
have
it.
now,
if
they
were
freed
from
agreements
not
to
compete;
it
is
quite
possible
that
they
could
still
achieve
some
of
the
benefits
of
individual
labeling.
for
example,
by
using
its
joint
organization
to
achieve
brands
for
each
of
them,
that
way
they
might
achieve
exclusivity
without
having
territorial
barriers
to
each
other.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
now,
you
got
it.
just
carrying
on
with
your
honor’s
question
for
a
moment,
topco
itself
sells
to
two
wholesalers.
one
of
them,
frankford
quaker
is
a
large
pennsylvania
wholesaler
and
it
obtains
supplies
from
topco
under
its
own
brand,
the
unity
brand.
in
another
instance,
topco
now
supplies
the
twin
forks
grocery
company,
this
is
a
large
wholesaler,
operating
up
in
delft
and
superior.
the
members
up
there
compete
in
the
grocery-supermarket
business
and
we
--
the
record
shows
that
topco
members
have
competed
with
each
other
in
the
sale
of
topco
products,
without
disastrous
results.
we
have
newspaper
advertisings
in
the
records
of
exhibits
115
to
132
that
show
that
fred
meyer
up
in
spokane,
washington
furnishes
topco
products
at
wholesale
to
groceries
who
compete
with
its
own
spokane,
washington
stores.
perhaps,
the
most
dramatic
example
i
can
give
of
this
is
the
instance
in
michigan.
there,
there
were
two
stores
that
had
a
coextensive
license,
plumbs
and
meijers.
one
of
them
--
they
both
entered
each
other’s
prime
territory,
as
the
phrase
is
used,
because
they
did
not
have
exclusive
licenses.
well,
meijers'
witness
testified
in
this
case
that
they
ended
up
competing
all
over
the
place
and
yet
the
meijers'
revenues
rose
in
that
area.
the
witness
explained
this
by
saying,
well,
sometimes
you
get
so
mad
and
work
so
hard
that
you
run
pass
yourself.
well,
this
is
what
we
think
the
sherman
act
is
about
and
this
is
what
the
per
se
prohibition
against
market
division
can
achieve.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no,
we
did
not.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
your
honor,
our
position
would
remain
that
if
topco
has
--
in
order
to
compete
and
engage
in
horizontal
territorialization,
you
have
to
give
up
topco
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
this
goes
to
the
reasons
for
having
per
se
rules.
one
of
the
assumptions
is
that
in
most
instances
horizontal
territorialization
is
just
going
to
be
extremely
harmful.
now,
once
in
a
while
a
case
may
come
along
in
which
that
is
not
so,
but
even
if
that
is
true,
you
still
apply
the
per
se
rule,
because
you
need
the
benefits
of
predictability.
right
now,
any
antitrust
lawyer
in
the
country
can
tell
a
supermarket
chain.
you
may
not
divide
up
territories
with
your
competitors.
the
law
is
absolutely
clear
on
it.
now,
along
comes
this
case,
which
says
you
will
find
out
whether
you
can
divide
up
territory
after
the
trial
because
we
will
go
through
a
full
scale
rule
of
re-examination.
now,
rule
of
re-examination
in
this
kind
of
case
is
extremely
difficult.
this
is
a
case
in
which
you
have
some
65
different
geographic
markets
involved.
the
district
court
tried
to
say,
well,
we
have
to
balance
a&p’s
interests
against
or
a&p’s
market
position
against
the
topco
member's
position,
and
yet
you
find
nothing
in
the
record
showing
what
a&p’s
position
is
in
these
65
markets.
it
is
almost
impossible
to
do
that
kind
of
vast
market
analysis.
instead,
the
district
court
tried
to
make
findings
as
to
market
shares,
based
on
the
market
areas,
in
which
these
firms
did
business
on
some
kind
of
average
basis
and
the
results
are
very
inaccurate.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
oh!
no,
your
honor.
it
is
not
simply
a
matter
of
the
government's
convenience
of
proof,
but
of
predictability
and
certainty
in
anti
trust
law
and
on
judicial
--
effective
judicial
administration,
as
well.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
it
is
one
of
the
factors
and
the
other
major
factor,
of
course,
your
honor
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
oh!
standing
alone,
it
would
not
be,
of
course.
the
factor
is
that
in
almost
every
instance
horizontal
territorialization
carries
adverse
effects
and
it
does
here.
we
think
there
are
at
least
three
things
we
can
point
to
that
a
company
of
this
kind
of
territorialization.
first,
the
territorialization
here
inhibits
expansion
by
the
members
into
each
other’s
territory.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
the
district
court
felt
that
the
public
would
be
disadvantaged
if
topco
were
to
dissolve.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
i
think
that
the
topco
organization
does
achieve
very
useful
and
beneficial
economies
of
scale
and
advantages
in
distribution
for
its
members.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
there
are
means
of
combining
group
buying
power
without
territorialization.
i
think
that
is
the
answer
that
has
to
be
given.
nobody,
as
far
as
we
know,
at
the
retail
level
uses
territorialization,
except
topco.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record,
no
testimony
by
either
expert
that
suggests
that
any
one
else
uses
horizontal
territorialization.
i
would
like
to
save
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
government’s
argument
has
been
that
the
competition
is
not
enhanced
by
the
territorialization
device
for
achieving
exclusivity.
in
very
brief
terms,
what
we
are
saying
is
that
it
is
better
to
have
two
topco
members
competing
against
a&p
in
a
given
market
or
kroger
or
safeway
than
one.
we
do
not
enhance
competition
by
erecting
a
barrier
around
the
market.
secondly,
we
have
argued
that
we
do
have
here
an
effect
on
price.
topco’s
expert
dr.
applebaum
(ph)
explained
the
whole
purpose
of
exclusivity
is
to
insulate
the
seller
from
competition
with
respect
to
price
and
try
and
get
as
much
control
over
price
and
margin
as
you
can.
so
that
exclusivity
itself
has
an
effect
on
price
and
when
exclusivity
is
achieved
by
territorial
agreements
not
to
compete,
that
effect
is
aggravated
because
we
have
the
third
consequence
of
this
agreement,
namely
something
that
inhibits
entry
into
each
others
markets.
now,
it
is
argued
that
well
there
really
is
not
any
inhibition
on
entry
into
markets.
people
can
enter
without
topco
products.
of
course,
they
can
enter
without
topco
products,
as
is
suggested
and
the
justification
for
the
importance
of
topco
is
not
as
great
as
it
has
been
suggested,
but
the
record
is
to
the
contrary.
just
to
use
the
exhibit
that
was
referred
to
a
moment
ago
at
page
440,
there,
there
is
the
discussion
of
the
second
line
of
products
and
it
is
also
pointed
out
that
at
page
438
and
439,
one
of
the
reasons
that
there
is
not
a
demand
for
second
line,
doubtless
rises
from
the
fact
that
it
is
impracticable
to
stock
in
the
same
warehouse,
duplicating
private
brand
inventories.
now,
this
really
means
that
once
you
are
into
the
topco
system
of
distribution,
so
that
it
is
your
basic
system,
anywhere
where
you
are
operating
out
of
your
basic
warehouses,
you
really
cannot
go
to
some
other
line,
if
you
want
to
expand
and
that
means
you
cannot
walk
into
another
topco
member's
territory
with
a
different
line
and
in
fact,
that
same
paragraph
illustrates
the
kind
of
conflict
we
run
into
here.
the
big
bear
liberal
situation
where
neither
wanted
to
give
up
the
brands
that
the
other
--
the
exclusivity,
but
and
neither
one
of
the
other
member
having
the
advantages
of
the
same
brand.
now,
this
goes
also
to
the
second
line.
if
you
look
at
page
440,
the
explanation
is
given
why
would
not
members
want
a
second
line
of
brands
and
the
answer
is
that
if
there
were
a
second
line,
the
competitive
edge
that
topco
members
gives
--
the
topco
programs
give
its
members
would
be
eliminated,
that
is
the
competitive
edge
they
have
against
each
other.
now,
the
district
court
found
expressly
a
third
factor,
finding
at
58
in
a
record
at
a56,
it
expressly
found
that
intra
brand
competition
is
eliminated.
there
was
nothing
else
it
could
find
on
this
record.
there
has
been
some
mention
here
about
the
importance
of
brand
loyalty
as
a
competitive
factor
here.
now,
the
record
on
brand
loyalty
is
that
no
one
can
determine
what
it
is
that
brings
the
housewife
in.
it
certainly
is
not
just
loyalty
to
a
private
label
brand.
people
do
not
travel
across
the
city
to
get
food
club
canned
peas.
dr.
barnes,
i
mean,
dr.
applebaum,
the
expert
put
on
by
the
defendants
testified
that
the
brand
loyalty
factor
really
cannot
be
determined
because
there
are
not
studies
available
to
do
so,
this
is
in
the
record
of
186
and
187.
a
point
has
been
made
that
the
government
did
not
specifically
attempt
to
prove
that
this
practice
was
anti-competitive
and
we
did
not
go
forward
with
evidence
beyond
enough
to
show
that
this
was
illegal
per
se.
we
did,
however,
on
the
record
that
was
made
try
to
carry
the
burden
to
show
that
this
practice
was
not
unreasonable
and
we
argued
principally
three
things
that
it
inhibits
expansion
by
members
into
each
others
territory,
that
it
affects
price
and
that
it
restricts
intra
brand
competition.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
let
us
suppose
that
we
had
in
the
same
market
--
let
me
give
the
example
that
i
referred
to
a
moment
ago,
the
situation
in
michigan.
two
topco
stores
meijers
and
plumbs
both
entered
each
others
territory,
grand
rapids,
muskegon
and
i
think
in
lansing
and
they
began
vigorously
competing
with
each
other.
they
were
necessarily
vigorously
competing
with
a&p,
as
well
and
the
result
is
--
the
result
for
meijers
was
very,
very
good,
because
meijers
ended
up
the
winner
in
that
contest
with
a
very
substantial
market
share.
that
is
really
what
it
boils
down
to.
with
this
system,
you
do
not
get
two
topco
members
competing
in
one
market,
they
get
one
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
this
was
price
competition.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
the
plumbs
and
meijers
were
competing
on
topco
brands.
they
handled
the
entire
line
together.
they
were
competing
all
over
the
place,
in
the
witness’
words.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
now,
we
do
not
agree
that
topco
would
collapse.
there
are
just
too
many
other
advantages
as
the
witness
has
testified,
particularly
dr.
barnes,
who
emphasized
these
very
substantial
advantages
that
the
topco
organization
had.
it
is
a
good
organization.
they
offer
very
good
buying
services.
i
think
one
witness
from
hillmans
to
described
them
as
a,
“we
use
them
like
our
own
buying
division”
and
they
have
very
excellent
quality
control
services
and
incidentally
it
would
not
have
to
develop
26
different
brands.
they
might
achieve
some
real
wonders
with
a
smaller
line
in
26,
for
each
store.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
may
i
qualify
it?
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
we
are
not
trying
to
stop
exclusivity.
we
are
trying
to
stop
the
achievement
of
exclusivity
by
territorial
agreement
and
wholesale
restriction
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
--
and
there
is
a
very
important
difference
(voice
overlap)
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
by
agreement
between
competitors,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
they
do
your
honor,
but
they
achieve
it
because
they
are
a
single
economic
and
legal
unit.
they
are
--
the
law
has
always
looked
differently
at
attempts
between
independent
firms
to
make
agreements,
but
not
to
compete
among
each
and
situations
where
a
single
firm
managing
its
own
affair,
restricts
competition
with
itself.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
oh!
yes,
your
honor
and
that
was
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
there
are
other
--
there
are
less
restrictive
means,
let
us
put
it,
which
is
really
what
the
ancillary
restriction
was
about.
there
are
less
restrictive
means
by
which
it
can
be
done,
your
honor.
