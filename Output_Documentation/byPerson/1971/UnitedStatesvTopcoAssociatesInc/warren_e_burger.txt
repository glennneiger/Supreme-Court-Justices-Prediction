mr.
shapiro,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
the
members
of
topco
in
any
way
inhibited
from
acquiring
other
brands
in
the
open
market?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
their
membership
does
not
restrict
their
activities?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
percentage
of
that
gross
is
represented
by
topco
brand
names?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
the
particular
chain
member,
who
has
a
small
chain,
wants
to
expand
his
territory,
does
he
have
any
problem
until
he
runs
into
the
territory
of
another?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
it
is
open
territory,
i
assume
topco
wants
to
sell
all
of
the
merchandise,
it
can
and
so
if
it
is
open,
they
can
move
into
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
it
is
open
in
the
sense
of
not
being
franchised
to
another
member?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
do
i
get
a
suggestion
out
of
your
argument
that
there
should
be
a
per
se
rule
because
it
is
inconvenient
and
difficult
for
the
government
to
prove
a
case-by-case
violation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
of
course
the
per
se
rule
is
always
very
predictable,
but
that
is
hardly
a
reason
standing
alone
for
having
per
se
rule?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
standing
alone
i
say?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
did
the
court
have
to
say,
the
district
court
have
to
say
about
the
impact
on
the
public
interest,
consumer
interest
if
topco
had
to
dissolve,
go
out
of
operation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
will
agree
with
that
in
and
off
itself
it
is
not
part
of
it
or
do
you
think
that
is
not
relevant?
chief

warren
e.

what
about
keeping
the
big

under
competitive
conditions?
chief

warren
e.
burger
fine,
mr.
shapiro.
mr.

chief

warren
e.
burger
now,
would
you
develop
that
course
a
little
bit?
i
assume
you
are,
but
if
not,
i
would
like
to
have
you
dwell
on
for
me
at
least.
well,
why
would
it
be
destroyed?
chief

warren
e.
burger
could
you
put
that
in
terms
of
an
illustration?
what
can
a&p
do
with
their
vertical
situation
that
is
analogous
to
this?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and,
a&p
i
take
it
controls
the
competitive
situation
as
between
stores
by
their
power
to
locate
their
supermarkets,
wherever
they
want
to?

chief

e.

which
chain
was
it
you
say
graduated
from

you
mentioned
one
of

chief

warren
e.

talking
about
that
period,
does
the

conceive
that
it
did
not
adversely
affect
prices
or
is
that
--?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
his
approach
was
that
assuming
the
government
was
correct
on
some
possible
adverse
competitive
impact,
it
was
offset
--
chief

chief

warren
e.
burger
mr.
shapiro,
you
have
about
seven
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
shapiro,
you
said
earlier
that
two
topco
stores
tend
to
compete
better
with
giant
than
one.
now,
that
has
the
ring
of
a
good
aphorism,
but
i
am
not
clear
on
why
it
is
necessarily
true,
could
you
enlarge
on
that?
i
am
not
rejecting
it.
i
just
do
not
understand
why
it
follows
that
that
is
true.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
the
same
brand?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
if
the
district
court’s
finding
is
correct,
the
breakdown
of
the
topco
method
that
you
attack
would
mean
that
you
might
not
have
any
topco
brands
there.
both
stores
might
to
decline
to
be
members
and
the
function,
that
is
all
assuming
that
the
district
judge
was
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
your
theory
mr.
shapiro,
if
there
cannot
be
an
exclusivity
of
the
brand
by
two
competing
topco
members,
that
is
what
you
are
trying
to
stop
is
that
exclusivity,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
want
to
stop
it
for
those
reasons
then?
now,
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
these
two
competing
chains,
putting
their
stores,
right
across
the
street
from
each
other,
is
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but,
giant
does
not
put
or
a&p
does
not
put
one
of
its
stores
across
the
street
or
hundred
yards
away
from
another
giant
store,
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
they
achieve
a
distribution
and
in
a
sense
of
limitation
of
competition
by
their
vertical
control,
do
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
least,
it
was
judge
will’s
view
whether
correctly
or
not
that
this
one
means
by
which
these
independents
could
hold
their
own
against
a&p
and
giants
and
the
other
big
ones.
now,
this
is
theory
in
part,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
challenge
that?
chief
justice
