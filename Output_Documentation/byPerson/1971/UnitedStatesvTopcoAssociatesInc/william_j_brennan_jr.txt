and,
what
is
it,
that
a
topco
affiliate
is
given
an
exclusive
license,
whatever
it
is,
they
sell
the
topco
brand
in
its
areas,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

that
is
the
crux
of
the
government's
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

is
the
operation
nationwide?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

but,
how
does
this
work
out?
you
said
giant
has
been
a
member
of
this.
suppose
7-eleven
also
and
their
competitors
in
a
way
in
this
area,
how
does
this
arrangement
work
out
as
between
them?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

are
we
concerned
then
only
with
the
exclusive
license?
justice
william
j.

you

in
the
hypothetical
i
gave
you

justice
william
j.
brennan,

tell
me.
are
you
guys
with
mr.
justice
white,
that
you
did
not
think
that
they
would
have
--
topco
would
have
to
dissolve,
if
the
government
prevailed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now
if
the
court
made
a
finding
that
it
would
and
suppose
we
accept
that,
suppose
we
had
to
accept
that
fact,
what
then
is
the
government’s
position?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though
it
would
have
just
(inaudible)
--
just
--?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
why
would
it
be
impossible
for
an
illustration
i
gave
to
shapiro,
having
all
of
the
topco,
with
all
the
economies
of
scale,
having
both
giant
and
7-eleven,
with
giant,
having
green
beans
under
some
private
giant
label
of
green
beans
and
7-eleven
having
some
7-eleven
green
beans
although
they
are
both
packed
by
the
same
patron,
but
the
economies
of
scale
realized
in
the
purchasing
and
the
packing
arrangement,
that
topco
affects
for
it.
why
is
something
like
that?
why
does
not
that
work?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
this
explored
exactly
in
the
district
court
at
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
this
possibility
explored
in
the
district
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
of
course
each
7-eleven
and
giant
had
its
own
label,
assuming
that
$350,000.00
was
not
that
much
of
value,
that
would
mean
of
course
that
neither
would
have
an
exclusive
on
that
particular
item,
even
though
it
is
under
a
different
brand
name?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

why
is
that
precisely
what
the
anti
trust
laws
preclude?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

the
illustration
i
h=gave

each
would
have
a
private

then
the
private
7-eleven
label
will
be
competing
with
the
private
giant
label?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
under
this
arrangement
that
does
not
happen,
because
only
giant
or
only
7-eleven
is
allowed
the
topco
private
label,
is
that
not
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

does
this
suggest
that
the
private
label
program
is
so
important
to
the
whole
arrangement
that
without
it
topco
would
disappear?
