mr.
victor
e.
grimm
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
court
recognized
in
the
white
motor’s
case,
that
caution
must
be
exercised
when
a
per
se
concept
is
extended
to
embrace
new
practices.
the
relevant
inquiry
in
such
a
circumstance
is
not
whether
an
existing
concept
can
be
read
broadly
enough
to
cover
a
new
practice,
but
rather
whether
the
rationale
and
the
policy
behind
the
rule
really
fits
into
practice.
per
se
rules,
after
all
are
based
upon
judicial
experience.
what
experience
then,
have
the
court’s
have
with
the
practices
such
as
those
here
presented?
i
would
point
out
that
in
the
district
court,
the
government
conceded
that
it
could
find
no
case,
which
would
justify
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
in
its
jurisdictional
statement
to
this
court,
the
government
pointed
out
that
the
court
had
never
been
presented
with
a
similar
case.
under
such
circumstances,
we
submit
that
it
was
proper
and
appropriate
for
the
district
court
to
engage
as
it
did
in
an
inquiry
into
the
economic
and
business
stuff
to
use
the
words
of
white
motor
decision,
from
which
these
competitive
practices
emerged.
judge
will
having
done
that,
found,
that
their
ultimate
effect
was
not
to
detract
some
competition,
but
to
enhance
it.
what
then
is
the
competitive
context,
which
the
district
court
found
in
this
industry
and
from
which
these
practices
emerged?
there
does
not
appear
to
be
any
dispute
concerning
the
purpose
for
which
topco
was
formed
or
for
which
it
continues
to
exist.
the
cooperative
was
formed
in
the
mid-1940s
by
a
group
of
local
grocery
chains,
who
recognized
that
the
only
way
to
successfully
compete
in
this
industry,
indeed,
perhaps
the
only
way
to
survive
in
the
industry,
was
to
duplicate
in
some
measure
the
advantages
of
scale,
which
the
giant
mass
merchandisers
had
attained.
we
have
set
forth
in
some
detail,
these
advantages
in
our
brief.
they
are
impressive
and
to
some
in
the
industry,
were
overwhelming,
but
judge
will
found
that
perhaps
the
most
competitively
significant
advantage
which
the
large
regional
and
national
chains
had
achieved
was
the
private
label.
private
label
permitted
these
chains
to
reduce
their
costs,
to
lower
their
prices
and
yet
to
increase
their
profits
and
at
the
same
time
to
instill
consumer
loyalty
for
their
stores.
the
national
chains
adopted
groups
of
trademarks,
by
which
to
identify
their
private
labels.
these
were
often
the
store
names
themselves
or
contractions
thereof.
the
trademarks
and
the
products
bearing
them
were
exclusive
in
these
large
chain
stores.
the
chain,
rather
than
the
store
was
--
rather
than
a
manufacturer
was
identified
as
the
source
of
those
products
in
the
mind
of
the
consumers.
the
consumers
soon
recognized
that
if
her
family
had
a
preference
for
ann
page
green
beans
or
eight
o’clock
coffee,
she
was
required
to
patronize
a&p
stores
in
order
to
obtain
those
items.
most
of
the
advantages
of
the
giant
national
chains
were
beyond
the
ability
of
smaller
operators
to
obtain.
one
which
was
not,
however,
was
the
private
label,
which
through
cooperative
efforts,
they
were
able
to
achieve.
these
cooperative
efforts
then
gave
them
one
competitive
tool
which
the
large
chains
had.
many
of
the
other
advantages
of
the
larger
chains
were
still
beyond
their
economic
reach.
the
topco
cooperative
adopted
a
family
of
brands,
which
each
of
its
members
could
use
and
identify
in
its
own
marketing
area
as
its
own
private
label.
each
continued,
however,
to
operate
under
its
own
store
names.
each
continued
to
adopt
his
own
merchandising
philosophy,
his
own
pricing.
each
continued,
in
short
to
remain
independent,
but
for
the
first
time
in
their
history
these
independent
chains,
had
the
means
of
meeting
the
significant
price
competition,
which
only
the
giant
chains
had
theretofore
offered
to
consumer.
the
trademarks
however,
adopted
by
these
cooperatives,
had
no
immediate
recognition
in
the
marketplace
as
often
did
those
of
the
national
chains.
it
was
necessary
for
each
operator
to
introduce
those
trademarks
into
his
own
marketing
area.
this
required
an
investment
in
time,
in
money,
in
effort,
in
resources.
such
an
investment
was
designed
to
identify
his
stores
with
these
products
in
the
mind
of
a
consumer,
just
as
the
large
national
chains
had
done,
to
build
a
secondary
meaning
for
them.
if,
however,
the
trademarks
which
were
used
as
private
labels
were
subject
to
use
by
another
operator
in
the
trading
area
of
a
member,
their
value
as
private
brands
would
be
destroyed.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
the
national
chains,
as
i
have
outlined,
had
developed
these
private
brands
and
they
had
built
them
as
competitive
tools.
through
them
they
had
instilled
the
consumer
loyalty
for
their
stores
and
--
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
a&p
would
develop
their
own
line
of
private
labels,
which
the
consumer
recognized
were
available
only
in
a&p
stores,
ann
page
was
one
of
their
principle
products,
for
example.m
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
that
is
correct,
but
the
consumer
knows
that
if
she
wants
to
buy
ann
page
green
beans,
for
example,
she
is
required
to
go
to
an
a&p
store
in
order
to
obtain
them.
it
engendered
the
uniqueness
for
the
stores.
one
of
the
basic
means
of
competition
in
this
industry
is
to
develop
a
uniqueness
for
the
store,
so
the
consumer
desires
to
shop
in
one
store,
as
opposed
to
another.
there
are
many
ways
of
doing
this,
but
the
most
competitively
significant
way
is
by
as
the
consumer
is
concerned
perhaps,
is
through
a
medium
which
offers
her
a
good
value
at
a
low
price
and
one
which
she
can
only
get
at
that
store
and
that
is
what
a&p
and
the
larger
chains
use
private
label
for.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
it
does
not
work
in
the
topco
context
because
even
though
they
have
combined
into
a
purchasing
organization
with
large
volumes,
they
still
have
not
achieved
sufficient
volume
by
which
they
could
have
a
different
private
label
for
each
member.
at
topco,
the
topco
cooperative
has
about
thousand
principal
items.
to
suddenly
make
it
a
cooperative
procuring
26,000
items,
in
effect,
under
each
different
member’s
own
label
would
require
an
investment
in
time
and
in
efforts,
which
would
be
beyond
the
resources
of
the
cooperatives
to
do.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
pardon
me
mr.
justice?
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
there
was
discussion
on
this.
i
would
refer
to
a
government
exhibit
wherein
the
possibility
of
one
second
line
of
labels
was
discussed
and
it
was
determined
that
it
was
--
that
one
second
line
alone
would
necessitate,
at
page
438
g.
ex.
102
of
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
government
exhibit
102
at
page
438,
in
which
one,
the
second
line
of
labels,
it
was
determined
to,
page
440
is
the
relevant
reference,
and
there
it
is
indicated
that
just
one
additional
line
of
labels
would
cost
$350,000.00,
well
beyond
the
capacity
of
it.
so
it
was
necessary,
in
order
to
achieve
the
advantages
for
them
to
develop
a
family
of
brands,
which
all
could
use
in
its
own
marketing
area,
but
in
order
to
achieve
this,
it
became
a
necessary
element
of
the
topco
cooperative
to
have
a
form
of
trademark
licensing.
this
trademark
licensing
made
the
system
work,
in
effect.
its
purpose
was
not
to
preclude
competition
among
topco
members,
but
rather
to
assure
that
the
private
brands,
though
cooperatively
obtained,
would
be
and
would
remain
the
private
brand
of
each
member
individually.
we
do
not
contend
that
trademark
licensing
or
the
existence
of
trademarks
provides
any
influation
installations
from
sherman
act
liability,
but
what
we
do
contend
is
that
trademark
licensing
in
this
context
serves
a
proper
and
pro-competitive
purpose
that
in
effect
it
makes
cooperative
procurement
of
private
labels
possible.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
the
purpose
is
not
to
prevent
another
member
from
having
the
identical
item,
in
terms
of
the
content
of
the
can
or
jar
or
container.
the
purpose
is
to
allow
each
member
to
have
a
private
label
that
is
a
trademark
which
he
can
develop
and
identify
as
private
label
(voice
overlap)
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
that
is
correct
and
this
is
(voice
overlap)
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
except
that
through
the
cooperative,
it
would
not
be
possible
for
them
to
obtain
second
lines
of
labels,
so
that
each
could
have
his
own
label.
the
economies
of
combined
purchasing
would
largely
be
lost
by
attempting
to
do
that.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
no,
it
would
not
do
that.
what
it
would
do
is
to
assure
that
each
member
would
have
his
private
label,
which
would
be
indeed
his,
other
operators
in
the
area
--
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
if
we
are
taking
only
the
topco
cooperative
as
a
source
of
private
brand
that
would
be
true.
there
are
other
sources
of
cooperative
private
labels,
which
in
such
cases
another
member
would
obtain
and
what
happens
is
a
practical
matter.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
they
do
indeed
and
they
must
because
--
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
topco
does
not
do
that.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
well,
it
is
more
than
start-up
cost.
it
is
having
a
staff
of
personnel
out
in
the
procuring
areas.
it
is
developing
a
second
line
of
labels
themselves,
the
art
work,
the
plates,
the
printing,
having
label
inventories.
there
are
large
group
of
factors
required
in
this
type
of
operation.
the
topco
organization
is
not
a
static
or
rigid
one.
a
topco
member
is
constantly
in
a
state
of
change,
as
the
larger
members
of
topco
grow
and
become
large
enough
to
in
fact
develop
their
own
private
label
programs,
which
as
the
record
indicate
requires
a
sales
volume
of
upwards
of
$250
million
annually,
they
graduate
from
the
topco
organization,
they
do
develop
their
own
private
label
programs
when
they
are
large
enough
to
do
so
and
often
under
their
own
store
names.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
well,
giant
was
one
i
believe
that
mr.
shapiro
mentioned.
giant
did
in
fact
leave
topco.
it
became
large
enough
to
develop
its
own
private
label
programs
and
has
its
own
procured
brand
and
i
believe
under
the
giant
name.
there
are
as
an
example
within
3
years
preceding
trial,
five
of
topco’s
largest
members
left
to
develop
their
own
private
label
program.
so,
the
topco
cooperative
is
a
way
station
in
a
cooperate
chains,
the
economic
development.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
that
is
correct
and
that
is
precisely
what
judge
will
found,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
i
think
that
it
would
be
a
process
and
i
think
that
if
i
can
describe
that
process
quite
briefly,
if
exclusivity
of
a
private
brand
would
be
lost,
the
members
closest
to
graduation,
closest
to
the
ability
to
develop
their
own
private
label
program
would
no
longer
be
interested
in
continuing
to
pour
their
corporate
resources
into
private
label,
which
would
be
subject
to
use
by
others,
and
therefore,
they
would
look
for
their
own
private
label
to
begin,
to
develop
their
own
private
label
program.
even
--
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
well,
there
may
be
but
if
they
would
no
longer
--
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
yes.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
that
is
right,
there
are
advantages,
but
they
are
advantages
of
the
private
label
program.
in
other
words,
the
topco
members
testified
that
the
purpose
for
which
they
joined
the
organization
was
to
obtain
private
label,
not
to
achieve
the
cost
advantages,
but
they
had
to
have
a
private
label
program,
which
was
also
cost
competitive.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
that
is
correct.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
well,
it
takes
a
transitional
period,
in
order
for
this
to
occur,
but
normally
when
a
chain
would
develop
its
own
private
label
or
frequently
when
they
will,
they
will
develop
and
other
their
own
corporate
name,
so
that
it
will
be
immediately
identified
in
the
mind
of
the
consumer
as
its
brand
of
that
store.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
that
is
correct,
it
may
--
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
or
contraction
of
the
store
name.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
the
membership
--
there
is
a
membership
committee
in
topco,
a
group
of
independent
employees
of
the
organization,
who
are
seeking
new
members
all
the
time
and
actively
soliciting
new
members,
for
new
membership
will
give
the
cooperative
the
volume
which
they
need
to
achieve
economy.
when
a
new
chain
comes
in
to
the
organization,
they
purchase
50
shares
of
common
stock.
they
purchase
preferred
stock
on
the
basis
of
a
formula
depending
upon
their
sales
volume
and
they
pay
service
charges
at
an
annual
basis,
based
upon
sales.
when
they
want
to
leave
topco,
they
are
required
only
to
give
60
days
notice,
but
there
is
provision
for
a
tapering
of
service
for
6
months,
during
this
transitional
period,
which
we
referred
to
earlier.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
the
common
stock
is
repurchased
at
par.
in
effect,
they
pay
$5,000.00
for
the
common
stock
and
it
is
repurchased
at
i
believe
at
par,
which
is
a
dollar
share.
so
that
part
of
it,
they
do
not
get
back,
but
the
preferred
stock
is
repurchased.
the
government
has
stated
in
its
brief
that
it
did
not
specifically
attempt
to
prove
any
adverse
effect
on
competition
and
yet,
contends
that
such
adverse
effect
ought
to
be
inferred.
this
inference
is
based
largely
upon
economic
theory,
which
we
contend
does
not
find
support
in
the
record
and
which
judge
will
rejected.
judge
will
found
that
topco
licensing
has
no
appreciable
influence
in
topco
member
expansion
and
does
not
control
or
affect
pricing.
the
topco
--
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
government
conceded
that
it
did
not
specifically
attempt
to
prove
an
adverse
effect
on
competition,
but
they
alleged
that
certain
inferences
are
ought
to
be
drawn
from
the
record,
in
terms
of
effect
on
expansion
and
prices,
where
these
inferences
that
were
rejected
by
judge
will.
topco
members
are
naturally
interested
in
expansion
and
growth.
judge
will
has
found,
as
i
have
said,
that
topco
licensing
has
no
appreciable
influence
on
member
expansion.
and,
the
government
has
been
able
to
cite
no
instance
to
the
contrary.
expansion
exists
as
follows:
let
me
try
to
outline
it
briefly.
when
a
member
desires
to
expand
into
a
new
area,
he
gets
a
license.
license
is
granted
in
a
matter
of
course
because
the
topco
cooperative
is
interested
in
having
its
members
expand.
even
in
license
barriers,
an
expanding
member
maybe
licensed
to
sell
topco
branded
products.
it
is
only
in
those
cases
where
a
primary
marketing
area,
the
heartland
of
another
member’s
operation
exists
that
a
member
may
not
be
licensed
to
sell
topco
brands.
but,
even
in
these
cases,
the
record
demonstrates
that
the
operator
will
use
alternative
sources
of
private
label
in
the
industry,
such
as
from
another
cooperative
or
from
a
wholesale
organization.
but
that
situation
would
not
often
occur
because
of
the
geographic
dispersion
of
topco
members
in
various
parts
of
the
country.
nor
with
refusal
to
apply
the
concept
of
--
despite
the
district
court’s
findings
that
the
topco
licensing
provision
resulted
in
no
unreasonable
restrain,
the
government
now
urges
that
these
findings
ought
now
to
be
ignored
because
the
government
urges
the
irrebuttable
presumption
is
an
unreasonable
restrain,
regardless
of
its
actual
effect.
we
submit
that
if
antitrust
law
--
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
judge
will
found
that
it
had
no
appreciable
influence
on
the
two
aspects
of
competition,
which
the
government
claims
were
injured.
one,
prices;
two,
expansion,
judge
will
specifically
found
the
topco
licensing
provisions
had
no
effect
on
prices,
did
not
--
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
that
reference
i
believe
was
a
reference
to
the
government’s
argument.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
no,
not
quite.
what
he
did
say
was
that
whatever
maybe
the
effect,
in
order
words,
the
government
has
argued,
this
to
me,
he
had
said,
he
said
whatever
may
be
the
effect,
it
is
far
outweighed
by
the
advantages.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
i
think.
i
do
not
think
that
is
quite
what
he
did,
if
(voice

mr.
victor
e.
grimm
i
do
not
think
that
is
the
proper
way
to
approach
the
problem
and
i
do
not
think
that
judge
will
approached
it
that
way.
what
judge
will
did
was
to
find
that
the
ultimate
effect
of
these
practices
was
to
benefit
competition.
the
ultimate
effect
was
not
adverse,
then
with
reference
to
the
government’s
argument
he
said,
whatever
may
be
their
adverse
effect
would
be
far
outweigh.
i
do
not
think
the
weighing
was
his
influence
here.
i
think
that
was
just
a
way
of
describing
the
government’s
argument.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
yes,
i
think
what
he
--
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
what
he
was
saying
is
that
the
ultimate
effect,
that
is
correct
mr.
chief
justice,
was
a
benefit
to
the
public.
let
us
look
at
a
moment
at
the
concept
of
the
horizontal
ancillary
--
horizontal
restraints
concept,
which
the
government
would
seek
to
have
applied
here.
this
per
se
concept
concerning
horizontal
market
division
finds
its
origin
and
application
in
those
cases,
where
competitors,
typically
those
with
sufficient
market
power
to
restrict
output,
if
they
chose,
have
combined
and
conspired
to
eliminate
all
competition
among
themselves.
such
naked
restraints
have
no
capacity
to
achieve
any
beneficial
effect
on
competition.
however,
when
the
courts
have
been
presented,
with
restrictions
which
are
necessary
and
reasonably
related
to
achieving
a
legitimate
venture,
the
courts
have
refused
to
apply
this
per
se
analysis
and
properly
so
we
submit.
for
such
arrangements,
have
a
capacity
to
intensify
competition,
and
therefore,
their
ultimate
effect
on
competition
must
be
discerned
and
judge
will
did
discern
that
effect
here
and
found
it
was
beneficial.
the
refusal
to
apply
per
se
rule
here
would
not,
we
submit,
result
in
interminable
economic
inquiries.
the
doctrine
of
ancillary
restraints
provides
a
well
defined
legal
concept,
by
which
to
identify
those
practices,
which
have
a
capacity
to
increase
efficiency
to
ultimately
enhance
competition
and
to
benefit
the
consumer.
this
distinction
was
highlighted,
we
submit,
in
the
sealy
case.
sealy
presented
a
combination
of
manufacturers,
who
agreed
to
refrain
from
selling
trademark
items
outside
of
licensed
areas.
despite
the
government’s
urging
in
that
case,
the
court
did
not
find
that
those
provisions
were
per
se
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
instead,
the
court
examined
the
context,
found
in
aggregation
of
trade
restraints,
including
unlawful
price-fixing
and
policing,
the
ultimate
purpose
and
effect
of
which
was
anti-competitive,
but
the
court
specifically
distinguished
those
quite
different
situations,
such
as
restrictions
incident
to
cooperative
efforts
among
small
grocers.
in
topco,
grocers
have
entered
into
cooperative
efforts,
not
for
the
purpose
of
eliminating
competition
among
themselves,
not
for
the
purpose
of
restricting
channels
of
distribution,
but
for
the
purpose
of
creating
new
grants.
more
important,
competitively
significant
private
labels
and
in
so
doing,
they
have
created
new
competition
in
industry
which
did
not
exist
before
and
which
can
continue
to
exist
only
because
of
the
licensing
provision.
we
do
not
contend
because
topco
members
are
small,
medium-sized
chain
because
their
purpose
is
to
assist
their
members
to
better
compete
in
the
industry
that
the
sherman
act
does
not
apply.
what
we
do
contend
is
that
the
ultimate
effect
of
these
practices
is
to
enhance
competition
and
judge
will
so
found.
the
government
here
seeks
to
claim
competition
in
private
labels,
but
that
is
a
contradiction
in
turn
because
competition
in
private
labels,
means
they
would
no
longer
be
private
and
would
deprive
the
consumer
of
the
competitive
benefits,
which
they
provide.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
as
mr.
shapiro
did
point
out,
there
are
two
topco
members
who
are
wholesalers.
in
the
one
that
mr.
shapiro
referred
to,
frankford
quaker,
which
operates
in
the
philadelphia
area,
there
are
a
few
brands,
perhaps
200
or
300
brands,
which
that
wholesaler
obtained
through
the
topco
cooperative,
which
are
a
second
line
of
labels.
in
other
words,
they
are
not
the
same
ones
that
the
topco
member
in
the
philadelphia
area
(voice
overlap)
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
that
is
right
and
that
retailer
serves
several
hundreds,
so
called
mom
&
pop
groceries.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
that
wholesaler,
i
am
sorry,
who
in
effect
use
those
as
their
private
labels.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
the
other
is
a
similar
organization.
i
believe
the
other
is
a
member
of
iga,
as
well,
and
therefore,
its
member
stores
would
operate
under
an
iga
name
or
something
similar.
they
would
present
a
chain
--
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
in
those
areas,
where
there
is
a
retail
member
existing,
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
that
is
correct.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
court
recognized
in
the
white
motor’s
case,
that
caution
must
be
exercised
when
a
per
se
concept
is
extended
to
embrace
new
practices.
the
relevant
inquiry
in
such
a
circumstance
is
not
whether
an
existing
concept
can
be
read
broadly
enough
to
cover
a
new
practice,
but
rather
whether
the
rationale
and
the
policy
behind
the
rule
really
fits
into
practice.
per
se
rules,
after
all
are
based
upon
judicial
experience.
what
experience
then,
have
the
court’s
have
with
the
practices
such
as
those
here
presented?
i
would
point
out
that
in
the
district
court,
the
government
conceded
that
it
could
find
no
case,
which
would
justify
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
in
its
jurisdictional
statement
to
this
court,
the
government
pointed
out
that
the
court
had
never
been
presented
with
a
similar
case.
under
such
circumstances,
we
submit
that
it
was
proper
and
appropriate
for
the
district
court
to
engage
as
it
did
in
an
inquiry
into
the
economic
and
business
stuff
to
use
the
words
of
white
motor
decision,
from
which
these
competitive
practices
emerged.
judge
will
having
done
that,
found,
that
their
ultimate
effect
was
not
to
detract
some
competition,
but
to
enhance
it.
what
then
is
the
competitive
context,
which
the
district
court
found
in
this
industry
and
from
which
these
practices
emerged?
there
does
not
appear
to
be
any
dispute
concerning
the
purpose
for
which
topco
was
formed
or
for
which
it
continues
to
exist.
the
cooperative
was
formed
in
the
mid-1940s
by
a
group
of
local
grocery
chains,
who
recognized
that
the
only
way
to
successfully
compete
in
this
industry,
indeed,
perhaps
the
only
way
to
survive
in
the
industry,
was
to
duplicate
in
some
measure
the
advantages
of
scale,
which
the
giant
mass
merchandisers
had
attained.
we
have
set
forth
in
some
detail,
these
advantages
in
our
brief.
they
are
impressive
and
to
some
in
the
industry,
were
overwhelming,
but
judge
will
found
that
perhaps
the
most
competitively
significant
advantage
which
the
large
regional
and
national
chains
had
achieved
was
the
private
label.
private
label
permitted
these
chains
to
reduce
their
costs,
to
lower
their
prices
and
yet
to
increase
their
profits
and
at
the
same
time
to
instill
consumer
loyalty
for
their
stores.
the
national
chains
adopted
groups
of
trademarks,
by
which
to
identify
their
private
labels.
these
were
often
the
store
names
themselves
or
contractions
thereof.
the
trademarks
and
the
products
bearing
them
were
exclusive
in
these
large
chain
stores.
the
chain,
rather
than
the
store
was
--
rather
than
a
manufacturer
was
identified
as
the
source
of
those
products
in
the
mind
of
the
consumers.
the
consumers
soon
recognized
that
if
her
family
had
a
preference
for
ann
page
green
beans
or
eight
o’clock
coffee,
she
was
required
to
patronize
a&p
stores
in
order
to
obtain
those
items.
most
of
the
advantages
of
the
giant
national
chains
were
beyond
the
ability
of
smaller
operators
to
obtain.
one
which
was
not,
however,
was
the
private
label,
which
through
cooperative
efforts,
they
were
able
to
achieve.
these
cooperative
efforts
then
gave
them
one
competitive
tool
which
the
large
chains
had.
many
of
the
other
advantages
of
the
larger
chains
were
still
beyond
their
economic
reach.
the
topco
cooperative
adopted
a
family
of
brands,
which
each
of
its
members
could
use
and
identify
in
its
own
marketing
area
as
its
own
private
label.
each
continued,
however,
to
operate
under
its
own
store
names.
each
continued
to
adopt
his
own
merchandising
philosophy,
his
own
pricing.
each
continued,
in
short
to
remain
independent,
but
for
the
first
time
in
their
history
these
independent
chains,
had
the
means
of
meeting
the
significant
price
competition,
which
only
the
giant
chains
had
theretofore
offered
to
consumer.
the
trademarks
however,
adopted
by
these
cooperatives,
had
no
immediate
recognition
in
the
marketplace
as
often
did
those
of
the
national
chains.
it
was
necessary
for
each
operator
to
introduce
those
trademarks
into
his
own
marketing
area.
this
required
an
investment
in
time,
in
money,
in
effort,
in
resources.
such
an
investment
was
designed
to
identify
his
stores
with
these
products
in
the
mind
of
a
consumer,
just
as
the
large
national
chains
had
done,
to
build
a
secondary
meaning
for
them.
if,
however,
the
trademarks
which
were
used
as
private
labels
were
subject
to
use
by
another
operator
in
the
trading
area
of
a
member,
their
value
as
private
brands
would
be
destroyed.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
the
national
chains,
as
i
have
outlined,
had
developed
these
private
brands
and
they
had
built
them
as
competitive
tools.
through
them
they
had
instilled
the
consumer
loyalty
for
their
stores
and
--
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
a&p
would
develop
their
own
line
of
private
labels,
which
the
consumer
recognized
were
available
only
in
a&p
stores,
ann
page
was
one
of
their
principle
products,
for
example.m
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
that
is
correct,
but
the
consumer
knows
that
if
she
wants
to
buy
ann
page
green
beans,
for
example,
she
is
required
to
go
to
an
a&p
store
in
order
to
obtain
them.
it
engendered
the
uniqueness
for
the
stores.
one
of
the
basic
means
of
competition
in
this
industry
is
to
develop
a
uniqueness
for
the
store,
so
the
consumer
desires
to
shop
in
one
store,
as
opposed
to
another.
there
are
many
ways
of
doing
this,
but
the
most
competitively
significant
way
is
by
as
the
consumer
is
concerned
perhaps,
is
through
a
medium
which
offers
her
a
good
value
at
a
low
price
and
one
which
she
can
only
get
at
that
store
and
that
is
what
a&p
and
the
larger
chains
use
private
label
for.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
it
does
not
work
in
the
topco
context
because
even
though
they
have
combined
into
a
purchasing
organization
with
large
volumes,
they
still
have
not
achieved
sufficient
volume
by
which
they
could
have
a
different
private
label
for
each
member.
at
topco,
the
topco
cooperative
has
about
thousand
principal
items.
to
suddenly
make
it
a
cooperative
procuring
26,000
items,
in
effect,
under
each
different
member’s
own
label
would
require
an
investment
in
time
and
in
efforts,
which
would
be
beyond
the
resources
of
the
cooperatives
to
do.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
pardon
me
mr.
justice?
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
there
was
discussion
on
this.
i
would
refer
to
a
government
exhibit
wherein
the
possibility
of
one
second
line
of
labels
was
discussed
and
it
was
determined
that
it
was
--
that
one
second
line
alone
would
necessitate,
at
page
438
g.
ex.
102
of
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
government
exhibit
102
at
page
438,
in
which
one,
the
second
line
of
labels,
it
was
determined
to,
page
440
is
the
relevant
reference,
and
there
it
is
indicated
that
just
one
additional
line
of
labels
would
cost
$350,000.00,
well
beyond
the
capacity
of
it.
so
it
was
necessary,
in
order
to
achieve
the
advantages
for
them
to
develop
a
family
of
brands,
which
all
could
use
in
its
own
marketing
area,
but
in
order
to
achieve
this,
it
became
a
necessary
element
of
the
topco
cooperative
to
have
a
form
of
trademark
licensing.
this
trademark
licensing
made
the
system
work,
in
effect.
its
purpose
was
not
to
preclude
competition
among
topco
members,
but
rather
to
assure
that
the
private
brands,
though
cooperatively
obtained,
would
be
and
would
remain
the
private
brand
of
each
member
individually.
we
do
not
contend
that
trademark
licensing
or
the
existence
of
trademarks
provides
any
influation
installations
from
sherman
act
liability,
but
what
we
do
contend
is
that
trademark
licensing
in
this
context
serves
a
proper
and
pro-competitive
purpose
that
in
effect
it
makes
cooperative
procurement
of
private
labels
possible.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
the
purpose
is
not
to
prevent
another
member
from
having
the
identical
item,
in
terms
of
the
content
of
the
can
or
jar
or
container.
the
purpose
is
to
allow
each
member
to
have
a
private
label
that
is
a
trademark
which
he
can
develop
and
identify
as
private
label
(voice
overlap)
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
that
is
correct
and
this
is
(voice
overlap)
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
except
that
through
the
cooperative,
it
would
not
be
possible
for
them
to
obtain
second
lines
of
labels,
so
that
each
could
have
his
own
label.
the
economies
of
combined
purchasing
would
largely
be
lost
by
attempting
to
do
that.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
no,
it
would
not
do
that.
what
it
would
do
is
to
assure
that
each
member
would
have
his
private
label,
which
would
be
indeed
his,
other
operators
in
the
area
--
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
if
we
are
taking
only
the
topco
cooperative
as
a
source
of
private
brand
that
would
be
true.
there
are
other
sources
of
cooperative
private
labels,
which
in
such
cases
another
member
would
obtain
and
what
happens
is
a
practical
matter.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
they
do
indeed
and
they
must
because
--
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
topco
does
not
do
that.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
well,
it
is
more
than
start-up
cost.
it
is
having
a
staff
of
personnel
out
in
the
procuring
areas.
it
is
developing
a
second
line
of
labels
themselves,
the
art
work,
the
plates,
the
printing,
having
label
inventories.
there
are
large
group
of
factors
required
in
this
type
of
operation.
the
topco
organization
is
not
a
static
or
rigid
one.
a
topco
member
is
constantly
in
a
state
of
change,
as
the
larger
members
of
topco
grow
and
become
large
enough
to
in
fact
develop
their
own
private
label
programs,
which
as
the
record
indicate
requires
a
sales
volume
of
upwards
of
$250
million
annually,
they
graduate
from
the
topco
organization,
they
do
develop
their
own
private
label
programs
when
they
are
large
enough
to
do
so
and
often
under
their
own
store
names.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
well,
giant
was
one
i
believe
that
mr.
shapiro
mentioned.
giant
did
in
fact
leave
topco.
it
became
large
enough
to
develop
its
own
private
label
programs
and
has
its
own
procured
brand
and
i
believe
under
the
giant
name.
there
are
as
an
example
within
3
years
preceding
trial,
five
of
topco’s
largest
members
left
to
develop
their
own
private
label
program.
so,
the
topco
cooperative
is
a
way
station
in
a
cooperate
chains,
the
economic
development.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
that
is
correct
and
that
is
precisely
what
judge
will
found,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
i
think
that
it
would
be
a
process
and
i
think
that
if
i
can
describe
that
process
quite
briefly,
if
exclusivity
of
a
private
brand
would
be
lost,
the
members
closest
to
graduation,
closest
to
the
ability
to
develop
their
own
private
label
program
would
no
longer
be
interested
in
continuing
to
pour
their
corporate
resources
into
private
label,
which
would
be
subject
to
use
by
others,
and
therefore,
they
would
look
for
their
own
private
label
to
begin,
to
develop
their
own
private
label
program.
even
--
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
well,
there
may
be
but
if
they
would
no
longer
--
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
yes.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
that
is
right,
there
are
advantages,
but
they
are
advantages
of
the
private
label
program.
in
other
words,
the
topco
members
testified
that
the
purpose
for
which
they
joined
the
organization
was
to
obtain
private
label,
not
to
achieve
the
cost
advantages,
but
they
had
to
have
a
private
label
program,
which
was
also
cost
competitive.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
that
is
correct.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
well,
it
takes
a
transitional
period,
in
order
for
this
to
occur,
but
normally
when
a
chain
would
develop
its
own
private
label
or
frequently
when
they
will,
they
will
develop
and
other
their
own
corporate
name,
so
that
it
will
be
immediately
identified
in
the
mind
of
the
consumer
as
its
brand
of
that
store.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
that
is
correct,
it
may
--
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
or
contraction
of
the
store
name.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
the
membership
--
there
is
a
membership
committee
in
topco,
a
group
of
independent
employees
of
the
organization,
who
are
seeking
new
members
all
the
time
and
actively
soliciting
new
members,
for
new
membership
will
give
the
cooperative
the
volume
which
they
need
to
achieve
economy.
when
a
new
chain
comes
in
to
the
organization,
they
purchase
50
shares
of
common
stock.
they
purchase
preferred
stock
on
the
basis
of
a
formula
depending
upon
their
sales
volume
and
they
pay
service
charges
at
an
annual
basis,
based
upon
sales.
when
they
want
to
leave
topco,
they
are
required
only
to
give
60
days
notice,
but
there
is
provision
for
a
tapering
of
service
for
6
months,
during
this
transitional
period,
which
we
referred
to
earlier.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
the
common
stock
is
repurchased
at
par.
in
effect,
they
pay
$5,000.00
for
the
common
stock
and
it
is
repurchased
at
i
believe
at
par,
which
is
a
dollar
share.
so
that
part
of
it,
they
do
not
get
back,
but
the
preferred
stock
is
repurchased.
the
government
has
stated
in
its
brief
that
it
did
not
specifically
attempt
to
prove
any
adverse
effect
on
competition
and
yet,
contends
that
such
adverse
effect
ought
to
be
inferred.
this
inference
is
based
largely
upon
economic
theory,
which
we
contend
does
not
find
support
in
the
record
and
which
judge
will
rejected.
judge
will
found
that
topco
licensing
has
no
appreciable
influence
in
topco
member
expansion
and
does
not
control
or
affect
pricing.
the
topco
--
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
government
conceded
that
it
did
not
specifically
attempt
to
prove
an
adverse
effect
on
competition,
but
they
alleged
that
certain
inferences
are
ought
to
be
drawn
from
the
record,
in
terms
of
effect
on
expansion
and
prices,
where
these
inferences
that
were
rejected
by
judge
will.
topco
members
are
naturally
interested
in
expansion
and
growth.
judge
will
has
found,
as
i
have
said,
that
topco
licensing
has
no
appreciable
influence
on
member
expansion.
and,
the
government
has
been
able
to
cite
no
instance
to
the
contrary.
expansion
exists
as
follows:
let
me
try
to
outline
it
briefly.
when
a
member
desires
to
expand
into
a
new
area,
he
gets
a
license.
license
is
granted
in
a
matter
of
course
because
the
topco
cooperative
is
interested
in
having
its
members
expand.
even
in
license
barriers,
an
expanding
member
maybe
licensed
to
sell
topco
branded
products.
it
is
only
in
those
cases
where
a
primary
marketing
area,
the
heartland
of
another
member’s
operation
exists
that
a
member
may
not
be
licensed
to
sell
topco
brands.
but,
even
in
these
cases,
the
record
demonstrates
that
the
operator
will
use
alternative
sources
of
private
label
in
the
industry,
such
as
from
another
cooperative
or
from
a
wholesale
organization.
but
that
situation
would
not
often
occur
because
of
the
geographic
dispersion
of
topco
members
in
various
parts
of
the
country.
nor
with
refusal
to
apply
the
concept
of
--
despite
the
district
court’s
findings
that
the
topco
licensing
provision
resulted
in
no
unreasonable
restrain,
the
government
now
urges
that
these
findings
ought
now
to
be
ignored
because
the
government
urges
the
irrebuttable
presumption
is
an
unreasonable
restrain,
regardless
of
its
actual
effect.
we
submit
that
if
antitrust
law
--
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
judge
will
found
that
it
had
no
appreciable
influence
on
the
two
aspects
of
competition,
which
the
government
claims
were
injured.
one,
prices;
two,
expansion,
judge
will
specifically
found
the
topco
licensing
provisions
had
no
effect
on
prices,
did
not
--
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
that
reference
i
believe
was
a
reference
to
the
government’s
argument.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
no,
not
quite.
what
he
did
say
was
that
whatever
maybe
the
effect,
in
order
words,
the
government
has
argued,
this
to
me,
he
had
said,
he
said
whatever
may
be
the
effect,
it
is
far
outweighed
by
the
advantages.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
i
think.
i
do
not
think
that
is
quite
what
he
did,
if
(voice
overlap)
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
i
do
not
think
that
is
the
proper
way
to
approach
the
problem
and
i
do
not
think
that
judge
will
approached
it
that
way.
what
judge
will
did
was
to
find
that
the
ultimate
effect
of
these
practices
was
to
benefit
competition.
the
ultimate
effect
was
not
adverse,
then
with
reference
to
the
government’s
argument
he
said,
whatever
may
be
their
adverse
effect
would
be
far
outweigh.
i
do
not
think
the
weighing
was
his
influence
here.
i
think
that
was
just
a
way
of
describing
the
government’s
argument.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
yes,
i
think
what
he
--
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
what
he
was
saying
is
that
the
ultimate
effect,
that
is
correct
mr.
chief
justice,
was
a
benefit
to
the
public.
let
us
look
at
a
moment
at
the
concept
of
the
horizontal
ancillary
--
horizontal
restraints
concept,
which
the
government
would
seek
to
have
applied
here.
this
per
se
concept
concerning
horizontal
market
division
finds
its
origin
and
application
in
those
cases,
where
competitors,
typically
those
with
sufficient
market
power
to
restrict
output,
if
they
chose,
have
combined
and
conspired
to
eliminate
all
competition
among
themselves.
such
naked
restraints
have
no
capacity
to
achieve
any
beneficial
effect
on
competition.
however,
when
the
courts
have
been
presented,
with
restrictions
which
are
necessary
and
reasonably
related
to
achieving
a
legitimate
venture,
the
courts
have
refused
to
apply
this
per
se
analysis
and
properly
so
we
submit.
for
such
arrangements,
have
a
capacity
to
intensify
competition,
and
therefore,
their
ultimate
effect
on
competition
must
be
discerned
and
judge
will
did
discern
that
effect
here
and
found
it
was
beneficial.
the
refusal
to
apply
per
se
rule
here
would
not,
we
submit,
result
in
interminable
economic
inquiries.
the
doctrine
of
ancillary
restraints
provides
a
well
defined
legal
concept,
by
which
to
identify
those
practices,
which
have
a
capacity
to
increase
efficiency
to
ultimately
enhance
competition
and
to
benefit
the
consumer.
this
distinction
was
highlighted,
we
submit,
in
the
sealy
case.
sealy
presented
a
combination
of
manufacturers,
who
agreed
to
refrain
from
selling
trademark
items
outside
of
licensed
areas.
despite
the
government’s
urging
in
that
case,
the
court
did
not
find
that
those
provisions
were
per
se
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
instead,
the
court
examined
the
context,
found
in
aggregation
of
trade
restraints,
including
unlawful
price-fixing
and
policing,
the
ultimate
purpose
and
effect
of
which
was
anti-competitive,
but
the
court
specifically
distinguished
those
quite
different
situations,
such
as
restrictions
incident
to
cooperative
efforts
among
small
grocers.
in
topco,
grocers
have
entered
into
cooperative
efforts,
not
for
the
purpose
of
eliminating
competition
among
themselves,
not
for
the
purpose
of
restricting
channels
of
distribution,
but
for
the
purpose
of
creating
new
grants.
more
important,
competitively
significant
private
labels
and
in
so
doing,
they
have
created
new
competition
in
industry
which
did
not
exist
before
and
which
can
continue
to
exist
only
because
of
the
licensing
provision.
we
do
not
contend
because
topco
members
are
small,
medium-sized
chain
because
their
purpose
is
to
assist
their
members
to
better
compete
in
the
industry
that
the
sherman
act
does
not
apply.
what
we
do
contend
is
that
the
ultimate
effect
of
these
practices
is
to
enhance
competition
and
judge
will
so
found.
the
government
here
seeks
to
claim
competition
in
private
labels,
but
that
is
a
contradiction
in
turn
because
competition
in
private
labels,
means
they
would
no
longer
be
private
and
would
deprive
the
consumer
of
the
competitive
benefits,
which
they
provide.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
as
mr.
shapiro
did
point
out,
there
are
two
topco
members
who
are
wholesalers.
in
the
one
that
mr.
shapiro
referred
to,
frankford
quaker,
which
operates
in
the
philadelphia
area,
there
are
a
few
brands,
perhaps
200
or
300
brands,
which
that
wholesaler
obtained
through
the
topco
cooperative,
which
are
a
second
line
of
labels.
in
other
words,
they
are
not
the
same
ones
that
the
topco
member
in
the
philadelphia
area
(voice
overlap)
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
that
is
right
and
that
retailer
serves
several
hundreds,
so
called
mom
&
pop
groceries.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
that
wholesaler,
i
am
sorry,
who
in
effect
use
those
as
their
private
labels.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
the
other
is
a
similar
organization.
i
believe
the
other
is
a
member
of
iga,
as
well,
and
therefore,
its
member
stores
would
operate
under
an
iga
name
or
something
similar.
they
would
present
a
chain
--
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
in
those
areas,
where
there
is
a
retail
member
existing,
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
that
is
correct.
