this

trial
before
judge

will,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
trying
to
emphasize
the
transient
nature
of
the
membership
of
topco
which
does
appear
in
the
record
and
the
brief?
how
does
it
work?
now,
giant
foods,
for
example
was
a
member
of
topco.
it
left
in
1966
and
when
it
left,
it
of
course,
then
no
longer
have
the
topco
private
labels,
it
has
had
its
own
labels,
i
suppose?
justice
potter
stewart
and
therefore,
lost
all
of
the
consumer
goodwill
and
habits
of
buying
of
the
previous
labels
and
had
it
to
develop
its
own
or
did
do
it
in
a
transitory
--
transitional
way?
justice
potter
stewart
often
it
is
not
the
cooperate
name,
but
it
is
some
sort
of
acronym
or
something?
justice
potter
stewart
or
add
page
for
a&p
and
so
on?
justice
potter
stewart
how
does
the
person
be
--
how
does
a
company
become
a
member
of
the
topco
and
how
does
it
get
out,
any?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
stock
they
owned,
does
topco
repurchase
by
something
or
what?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
grimm,
one
thing
i
--
it
is
not
entirely
clear
to
me
on
the
factual
situation
is
this.
one
of
the
things
that
the
government
says
is
violative
of
the
antitrust
law
is
the
restriction
on
wholesaling.
there
are
two
--
two
of
the
members
of
topco
are
wholesalers.
how
do
they
operate?
how
do
they
fit
in
to
this
picture
and
into
this
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
your
topco
retail
member
carries?
justice
potter
stewart
that
wholesaler,
you
mean?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
now,
that
is
one
of
them,
the
other
-?
justice
potter
stewart
the
wholesalers
therefore
deal
in
a
secondary
label,
in
a
different
label
from
the
label
carried
by
the
retail
member
in
the
same
area?
justice
potter
stewart
but
they
might
deal
in
the
primary
label
in
an
area
where
there
is
not
a
retail
member
and
in
that
area,
the
wholesalers
will
just
sell
to
the
independent
mom
&
pop
corner
grocery
stores?
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
