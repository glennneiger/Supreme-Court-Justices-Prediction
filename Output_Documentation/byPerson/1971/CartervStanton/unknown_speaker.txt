unknown
speaker
what
if
the
three-judges
court
convene
is
convened
on
the
examine
of
pleadings
and
then
dismiss
and
say
that
the
constitution
may
choose
this
case
for
privilege?
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
--
that
is
appealable
here.
unknown
speaker
what
were
the
periods
in
those
cases?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
they
were
shorter
than
six
months.
unknown
speaker
you
are
not
claiming
that
any
time
period
would
necessarily
be
violative
of
the
statute,
of
the
constitution,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
that
conceivably,
a
man
could
leave
in
the
morning
at
7:30
and
24
hours
later
his
wife
can
go
and
apply
for
assistance
saying,
my
husband
left
this
morning
and
well,
i
know
he
is
not
going
to
come
back.
unknown
speaker
at
least
so
far
is
it
where
almost
conclusive
presumption?
unknown
speaker
so
that
is
what
you
mean.
unknown
speaker
i
can
understand
your
argument
about
three-judge
court
jurisdiction,
but
how
about
federal
jurisdiction
at
all?
how
about
jurisdiction
at
federal
court,
are
you
under
1983
is
that
what
you
are
--
unknown
speaker
1343(4)?
unknown
speaker
and
in
terms
of
the
federal
jurisdiction
at
all,
the
other
side
simply
claims
1983
does
not
reach
this
kinds
of
suit?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
lower
courts
have
rule
that
it
did
not
have
jurisdiction
under
1343
or
(4)
and
i
wonder
what
the
basis
for
that
three-judge
courts
ruling
was?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
in
the
sentence.
unknown
speaker
what
is
that
citation?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
a
good
judgment,
was
it
not
by
the
three-judge
court
on
the
merits
of
the
case?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
or
they
may
have
been
correct
and
they
may
have
been
incorrect,
but
many
of
that
it
was
a
judgment
on
the
merits
of
the
complaint,
was
it
not
by
three-judge
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
that
case
there
was
a
remand
of
the
single
judge
court,
that
is
the
difference.
unknown
speaker
it
is
just
a
technical
difference.
unknown
speaker
well,
congress
may
have
done
exactly
that.
it
is
not
vast
unlike
the
jurisdiction.
congress
did
it
and
it
gave
us
jurisdiction
of
direct
appeal
from
an
action
of
a
three-judge
court.
unknown
speaker
certain
action
for
three-judge
court.
unknown
speaker
now,
i
hear
a
direct
appeal
to
this
court
from
the
judgment
of
a
three-judge
court
either
granting
or
denying
in
the
judgment?
unknown
speaker
did
the
district
court
hold
what
you
have
just
told
us?
unknown
speaker
but
they
held
that
on
the
pleadings
that
there
was
no
substantial
federal
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
and
now
certainly
the
pleading
of
the
complaint
alleged
the
existence
of
this
six
months
rule,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
in
the
absense
of
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
they
did
not
refer
in
order
to
the
evidence
acceptance
so
far
as
the
federal
exhaust
administrative
remedies.
they
did
not.
unknown
speaker
they
did
not
in
anyway
decide
that
this
alleged
six
months
rule
really
did
not
exist?
i
mean
really
was
not
arbitrary
or
conclusive
presumption.
did
they?
unknown
speaker
court
did
not
find
that.
unknown
speaker
i
have
heard
that
did
but
what
supposed
that
in
mcnesse
turned
on
those
facts?
unknown
speaker
but
i
gathered
what
is
worth,
what
mcneese
said
indicated
that
was
the
case
that
you
need
not
if
you
have
a
1983
exhaust
state
administrative
remedy
for
the
time.
unknown
speaker
so
really
i
gathered
what
you
are
suggesting,
is
that
we
have
to
review
mcneese?
unknown
speaker
that
meaning
that
the
implication
was
of
adequate
administer
to
review
than
you
did
have
to?
unknown
speaker
is
the
subject
to
review,
is
that
decision
subject
to
court
review?
unknown
speaker
which
court?
unknown
speaker
he
brings
the
new
action,
is
it
the
de
novo,
is
it
a
review
on
administrative
record?
unknown
speaker
would
the
state
court
be
limited
to
the
administrative
record
or
would
it
be
de
novo?
unknown
speaker
and
similarly
in
the
federal
court?
unknown
speaker
when
does
it
sound
like
much
with
administrative
proceedings
if
you
really
are
reviewing
the
administrative
decision
on
the
administrative
records?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
history
of
the
time
it
takes
to
complete
the
administrative
review
you
described
for?
unknown
speaker
well
that
is
the
standard
change
after
six
months
as
to
whether
a
person
can
get
relief?
unknown
speaker
it
is
on
the
exceptional
need
they
just
need?
unknown
speaker
was
there
any
application
here
for
the
emergency
relief
during
the
six
months?
unknown
speaker
with
an
attempt
to
show
exceptional
needs?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
statute
permits
or
the
regulations
permits
relief
within
the
six
months.
before
the
six
months
expired
in
the
case
there
is
extraordinary
need.
unknown
speaker
was
there
any
attempt
here
to
get
that
kind
of
extraordinary
relief?
unknown
speaker
and
it
was
denied?
unknown
speaker
but
all
of
them
did
not.
unknown
speaker
well
that
would
mean
there
is
--
really
is
there
any
case
of
controversy
here?
unknown
speaker
if
you
are
really
saying
that
is
another
strange
way
of
writing
a
regulation,
putting
in
a
regulation
that
required
six
month
separation
and
then
saying
it
does
not
mean
anything.
unknown
speaker
you
still
have
to
show
need
after
six
months,
do
you
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
the
standard
of
need.
it
is
the
same
but
it
does
not
-â€“it
is
not
the
finding
that
there
is
only
parent
is
the
same.
you
have
already
told
us
that
after
six
months
has
the
conclusive
presumption
that
was
one
parent
has
left.
before
six
months
there
is
no
such
presumption.
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
this
does
not
--
what
is
involved
here
is
perhaps
not
technically
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies,
but
rather
your
claim
that
in
the
actual
administration
of
this
rule
it
does
mean
what
it
seems
to
me.
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
that
in
the
actual
administration
of
welfare
in
indiana
or
in
marion
county,
indiana
that
this
six
months
rule
is
a
not
administered
so
as
to
make
it
mean
what
it
seems
to
me.
is
that
what
you
are
telling
us?
unknown
speaker
and
that
therefore
they
had
proceeded
to
seek
relief
under
the
administrative
procedures
available.
they
would
have
found
that
this
rule
was
no
barrier.
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
16
witnesses
in
the
record
here
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
--
or
were
these
16
witnesses
were
they
all
welfare
claims?
unknown
speaker
and
how
many
of
them
were
deserted
mothers?
unknown
speaker
and
then
each
of
them
testified.
was
there
evidence
from
each
of
them
that
or
some
of
them
at
she
in
fact
got
the
early
assistance
at
two
months
or
one
month
that
you
have
been
telling?
unknown
speaker
in
less
than
six
months?
unknown
speaker
so
i
suppose
your
position
is
that
one
of
them,
the
case
is
to
one
is
that
she
was
denied
for
six
months
that
she
was
just
standing
on
the
class
action
that
--
unknown
speaker
and
that
she
get,
did
that
one
get
aid
after
six
months?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
three-judges
court
convene
is
convened
on
the
examine
of
pleadings
and
then
dismiss
and
say
that
the
constitution

at

so

is
it

so
that
is
what
you

unknown

i
