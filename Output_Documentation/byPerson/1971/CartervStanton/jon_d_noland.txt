mr.
jon
d.
noland
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
direct
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
three-judges
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
indiana
which
dismissed
appellants
complaint
for
failure
of
federal
jurisdiction.
the
issues
involved
are
jurisdiction
of
questions
pertaining
both
to
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
to
hear
the
appeal
under
section
1253
of
the
judicial
code
and
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
three-judge
district
court.
the
plaintiffs
in
this
action
were
mothers
of
dependent
children
to
at
the
time
of
filing
their
complaint
in
the
district
court
had
been
denied
either
the
right
to
file
an
application
for
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children
or
had
been
denied
assistance
under
that
program.
jurisdiction
below
was
founded
on
section
1343(3)
and
(4)
of
the
united
states
code
and
the
action
was
brought
under
section
1
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1871.
plaintiffs
brought
the
action
on
their
own
behalf
and
as
a
class
action
on
behalf
of
other
mothers
similarly
situated.
the
social
security
act
defines
a
dependant
child
as
a
needy
child
who
has
been
deprived
of
parental
care
or
support
by
reason
of
the
continued
absence
from
the
home
of
a
parent.
plaintiffs
alleged
that
they
were
entitled
to
assistance
under
this
provision
because
their
husbands
and
the
fathers
to
their
children
had
deserted
the
home.
plaintiffs
also
alleged
in
their
complaint
that
aid
under
this
provision
was
denied
pursuant
to
indiana
regulation
2402(b)
which
is
set
forth
at
the
bottom
of
page
5
of
appellants
brief.
this
regulations
state
when
the
continued
absence
is
due
to
desertion
or
separation.
the
absence
shall
have
been
continuous
for
a
period
of
at
least
six
months
prior
to
the
date
of
application
for
assistance
except
that
under
exceptional
circumstances
of
need
and
where
it
is
determined
that
the
absence
of
apparent
is
actual
and
bonafiding,
an
application
maybe
filed
and
a
child
maybe
considered
immediately
eligible
upon
a
special
finding
of
the
county
department
of
welfare.
a
three-judge
court
was
convened
to
hear
the
plaintiffs
allegation
that
this
regulation
was
not
only
unconstitutional,
but
was
also
contrary
to
provisions
of
the
social
security
act.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
yes
it
was
brought
as
a
class
action
your
honor.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
that
is
right.
mothers
who
had
been
denied
welfare
benefits
under
this
regulation
because
the
husband
had
not
been
away
from
the
home
for
a
period
of
six
months.
following
the
convening
of
the
three-judge
court,
each
of
the
two
appellees,
the
county
department
of
public
welfare
and
the
state
department
of
public
welfare
filed
motions
to
dismiss
the
complaint.
these
motions
were
based
primarily
on
two
grounds.
one,
a
failure
on
the
part
of
the
plaintiffs
to
exhaust
their
state
administrative
remedies,
and
secondly
the
failure
of
the
complaint
to
raise
substantial
constitutional
questions.
the
three-judge
panel
then
convened
a
combine
hearing
both
on
the
motions
to
dismiss
and
on
the
merits
of
the
case.
evidence
was
heard
from
approximately
16
witnesses
and
at
that
point
the
court
adjourned
the
hearing
and
granted
the
motions
to
dismiss.
the
court's
entry
appears
at
page
210
of
the
appendix
and
on
page
212
of
the
entry.
the
entry
demonstrates
that
the
decision
of
the
court
was
based
one
upon
the
court's
finding
that
each
of
the
plaintiffs
had
failed
to
exhaust
their
state
administrative
remedies,
and
secondly,
the
court
held
we
have
examined
the
pleadings
before
us
and
find
no
substantial
federal
question
involved
nor
do
we
find
federal
jurisdiction
under
28
us(c)
section
1343(3)
and
(4).
it
is
apparent
to
the
appellants
from
this
entry
that
the
district
court
resolved
none
of
the
conflicts
in
testimony
which
became
evident
during
the
course
of
the
hearing.
rather,
it
made
it
so
finding
that
the
plaintiffs
had
failed
to
exhaust
state
administrative
remedies
and
then
on
the
basis
of
the
pleadings
and
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
pleadings,
it
found
that
no
substantial
federal
questions
were
presented
for
decision.
before
turning
to
the
correctness
of
the
decision
of
the
district
court,
the
appellee,
the
state
department
of
public
welfare
has
raised
a
threshold
question
in
this
case
pertaining
to
this
court's
jurisdiction
under
section
1253
of
the
judicial
code.
as
we
understand
the
argument,
the
appellants
and
the
appelleeâ€™s
contention
is
that
in
failing
to
find
substantial
federal
question,
the
three-judge
panel
in
effect
dissolved
itself
and
that
therefore
the
final
entry
should
be
construed
as
having
been
the
decision
of
a
single
district
judge.
in
support
of
that
decision
the
appellee
relies
primarily
upon
two
per
curium
decisions
of
this
court.
mengelkoch
versus
wilson,
mengelkoch
versus
the
industrial
welfare
commission
and
wilson
versus
city
of
port
lavaca.
without
repeating
all
of
the
argument
set
forth
in
appellants
reply
brief,
we
believe
that
this
case
is
significantly
different
from
those
decisions
and
that
here
there
was
no
express
finding
by
the
three-judge
panel
that
it
had
been
improperly
convened.
the
final
decision
in
fact
was
entered
by
all
three-judges.
in
addition,
it
is
apparent
from
the
entry
that
in
large
part,
the
decision
of
the
district
court
was
based
upon
the
failure
to
exhaust
state
administrative
remedies.
and
as
we
read
this
courts
decision
in
idlewild
liquor
corporation
against
epstein
that
is
a
consideration
which
could
be
properly
made
only
by
three-judge
court
and
not
by
a
single
district
judge.
furthermore
the
court
here
convened
the
hearing
on
the
merits
as
well
upon
the
motion
to
dismiss
and
took
extensive
evidence
from
approximately
16
witnesses.
again,
we
submit
that
this
is
a
procedure
which
could
be
followed
followed
only
by
the
three-judge
court.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
it
is
certainly
conceivable
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
three-judge
panel
could
have
heard
witnesses
and
decided
on
the
basis
of
the
testimony
induce
that
the
complaint
failed
to
raise
substantial
constitutional
questions
and
dissolve
itself
and
then
left
the
final
judgment
for
single
district
judge.
by
not
doing
so,
we
believe
the
district
court
here
recognized
in
fact
that
it
was
not
making
a
determination.
within
the
meaning
of,
for
example
ex
parte
poreski
(ph)
that
the
complaint
failed
to
raise
substantial
constitutional
questions,
but
made
that
decision
on
the
basis
of
a
finding
of
a
failure
to
exhaust
state
administrative
remedies.
we
submit
that
what
has
happened
here
is
the
district
court
has
taken
this
court's
decision
in
king
versus
smith
and
turned
the
formula
around
and
said
in
this
case
substantial
constitutional
questions
are
not
raised
because
there
was
a
failure
to
exhaust
state
administrative
remedies,
and
we
submit
that
that
is
a
determination
which
could
made
only
by
the
three-judge
court.
in
support
of
appellants
position
on
this
point,
we
believe
the
recent
decision
of
this
court
on
october
12
of
this
year
in
a
case
of
hicks
versus
pleasure
house,
inc.
is
instructive
or
in
that
decision,
the
court
characterized
the
wilson
decision
and
the
mengelkoch
decision
as
holding
that
an
appeal
may
lie
to
a
court
of
appeals
from
certain
action
of
a
single
district
judge
in
a
case
required
to
be
heard
by
three-judges.
and
again
here
we
have
no
action
of
a
single
district
judge,
but
a
final
appealable
judgment
entered
by
the
three-judge
court.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
we
believe
that
this
court
has
jurisdiction
over
that
direct
opinion.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
that
as
we
understand
the
decisions
of
this
court
following
wilson
versus
mengelkoch,
there
are
series
of
four
decisions
cited
in
appellants
reply
brief
in
which
that
procedure
was
followed,
and
in
which
this
court
took
jurisdiction
on
direct
appeal.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
that
is
the
mengelkoch
case
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
the
three-judge
court
--
mr.
jon
d.
noland
dissolved
itself
and
final
judgment
was
rendered
by
a
single
district
judge.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
that
is
correct.
turning
now
to
the
precise
nature
of
attacks
on
the
regulation
below.
appellants
have
attacked
the
regulation
at
the
bottom
of
page
5
of
their
brief,
both
on
constitutional
and
statutory
grounds.
two
attacks
were
made
on
the
basis
of
the
regulation
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
the
first
attack
relates
to
the
requirement
that
where
the
separation
has
been
for
a
period
of
less
than
six
months.
exceptional
circumstances
of
need
must
be
shown
in
order
to
secure
a
waiver.
we
see
no
rational
basis
for
saying
that
if
the
separation
has
been
for
less
than
six
months,
a
child
must
be
exceptionally
needy.
while
if
the
separation
has
been
for
more
than
six
months
mere
need
is
sufficient.
therefore,
we
argue
below
that
this
particular
provision
of
the
regulation
constituted
a
denial
of
equal
protection
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
do
not
believe
that
this
question
is
rendered
in
substantial
or
frivolous
by
the
court's
decision
in
dandridge
against
williams.
we
have
an
entirely
different
factual
situation,
a
different
type
regulation
in
this
case.
a
regulation
under
which
the
appellant
and
other
applicants
have
been
denied
all
aid.
we
do
not
have
here
a
maximum
grant
type
regulation
where
the
families
are
already
receiving
some
type
of
assistance
and
a
maximum
level
is
established.
secondly,
the
appellants
have
attacked
the
regulation
on
its
face
as
granting
a
standard
list
and
arbitrary
discretion
to
the
administrator.
as
pointed
out,
in
order
to
secure
a
waiver
of
the
six
months
requirement,
a
special
finding
must
be
made
by
the
county
department
of
public
welfare.
two
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
alleged
in
the
complaint
that
no
investigation
had
been
made
into
their
circumstances
upon
which
such
a
special
finding
could
be
based.
on
this
basis,
we
believe
the
administrator
has
discretion
as
to
whether
to
conduct
an
investigation
in
any
particular
case.
the
discretion
which
is
not
guided
by
any
standards.
furthermore,
whether
it
is
a
failure
to
conduct
an
investigation,
the
regulation
in
effect
enacts
and
concludes
the
presumption
that
an
absence
for
less
than
six
months
cannot
be
a
continuous
absence.
in
these
particular
cases
therefore,
we
have
a
rigid
six
month
waiting
period
and
the
same
type
of
regulation
or
statute
which
was
involved
in
the
damico
case
and
in
the
minnesota
case
of
bill
versus
hersh
(ph).
mr.
jon
d.
noland
both
of
those
periods
were
three
month
periods
your
honor.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
both
statute
where
struck
down
as
being
contrary
to
social
security
act
although
the
court,
each
court
conceded
that
the
constitutional
claims
raise
were
substantial.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
we
believe
that
any
time
period
--
mr.
jon
d.
noland
that
is
correct
your
honor,
obviously
situations
will
vary,
in
some
cases
the
administrator
maybe
able
to
reach
a
determination
that
if
absences
continued
two
or
three
days
after
the
husband
departs.
in
other
cases,
it
may
take
longer
to
arrive
at
that
determination.
we
do
believe
--
mr.
jon
d.
noland
i
am
suggesting
and
no
your
honor
that
it
would
not
be
unconstitutional
but
anything
above
that
would
be
a
violation
of
the
social
security
act.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
that
is
correct.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
that
is
correct.
i
think
our
primary
problem
with
this
regulation
is
relating
the
exceptional
circumstances
of
need
requirement
to
a
durational
requirement.
we
could
see
no
rational
basis
for
saying
that
even
though
it
maybe
difficult
to
arrive
at
a
determination
of
continued
absence
that
a
waiver
will
be
granted
only
if
exceptional
circumstances
of
need
are
present.
we
believe
that
violates
social
security
act
which
speaks
of
needy
children
and
not
exceptionally
needy
children.
in
addition,
the
appellants
have
alleged
in
their
complaint
that
there
is
a
statewide
policy
in
practice
under
this
regulation
of
requiring
applicants
to
file
for
legal
separation
or
divorce
in
order
to
secure
a
waiver
of
the
six
month
period.
the
testimony
before
the
three-judge
panel
on
this
question
was
directly
conflicting.
there
was
evidence
on
behalf
of
plaintiffs
that
such
a
practice
had
been
engaged
in,
at
least
in
their
cases
and
in
other
cases.
the
administrators
on
the
other
hand
denied
the
existence
of
any
such
practice.
as
we
think
as
apparent
from
the
court's
entry,
the
court
they
know
fact
finding
as
to
whether
this
practice
did
or
did
not
exist.
apparently,
assume
the
existence
of
the
practice
and
yet
nevertheless
found
that
the
constitutional
issue
is
raised
for
insubstantial.
appellants
urge
that
such
practice
that
exist
as
alleged
constitutes
denial
of
first
amendment
and
the
equal
protection
clause
of
fourteenth
amendment.
turning
now
to
the
question
of
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies,
we
think
this
is
the
primary
basis
for
the
decision
of
the
district
court.
as
appellants
have
read,
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court
there
is
an
absolute
exemption
from
any
exhaustion
requirement
or
actions
brought
under
the
civil
rights
act.
this
is
been
established
both
by
the
damico
versus
california
and
king
versus
smith.
we
submit
that
there
is
important
policy
justification
for
such
an
exemption.
cases
such
as
this
under
the
civil
rights
act
and
particularly
welfare
cases
involve
essentially
or
primarily
questions
of
federal
law
whether
the
constitutional
law
or
statutory
law.
we
see
no
need
therefore
for
the
state
administrator
to
consider
state
law
to
make
any
fact
finding
based
on
the
record
before
an
administrative
agency
or
to
apply
their
expertise
or
discretion.
the
regulation
here
is
being
attacked
both
on
its
face
and
does
apply.
we
believe
these
issues
can
properly
be
determined
by
a
federal
court
without
exhaustion.
in
addition,
if
exhaustion
is
to
be
required
in
certain
cases
we
submit
that
this
is
not
such
a
case
because
the
administrative
remedy
is
inadequate.
there
is
no
identical
administrative
remedy
in
indiana.
that
remedy
is
solely
individual
in
nature,
there
is
no
class
action
procedure
before
the
administrative
agency.
in
addition
that
an
administrative
appeal
does
not
result
in
any
decision
of
general
applicability
throughout
the
state.
now
the
appellee's
state
department
in
this
has
devoted
a
large
portion
of
its
brief
to
arguing
that
full
discovery
rights
are
available
in
administrative
proceedings
in
indiana.
the
appellants
do
not
dispute
that
proposition
as
a
matter
of
statute
but
law.
however,
the
very
record
in
this
case
demonstrates
that
any
pursuit
of
discovery
before
the
administrative
agency
would
be
entirely
feudal.
the
plaintiffs
below
filed
both
subpoenas
and
motions
to
produce
to
obtain
copies
of
case
files
and
other
documents
pertaining
to
the
application
of
the
challenge
regulation.
both
the
state
department
and
the
county
department
resisted
any
motion
to
produce
on
the
basis
that
the
records
requested
were
confidential
in
nature.
and
in
a
letter
to
the
court
and
to
council
dated
november
5,
1970
state
welfare
department
stated,
i
specifically
request
that
you
obtain
a
court
order
to
require
mr.
sterick
(ph)
to
produce
these
files
at
the
time
of
his
proposed
examination.
the
county
welfare
department
said
essentially
the
same
thing
in
an
affidavit
filed
in
support
of
their
objection.
now
it
is
essential
in
case
such
as
this
that
the
plaintiffs
have
access
to
the
documents
in
order
to
establish
their
constitutional
allegations
that
this
regulation
has
been
applied
in
such
a
manner
as
to
be
contrary
to
the
equal
protection
clause.
yet
the
appellees
have
told
us
in
this
very
case
that
they
will
require
a
court
order
in
order
to
produce
the
documents
requested.
appellants
know
of
no
procedure
in
indiana
whereby
a
court
order
can
be
obtained
without
filing
a
law
suit.
therefore
we
submit,
we
are
back
right
where
we
started
from.
the
appellants
would
receive
none
of
the
documents
in
an
administrative
proceeding
and
would
be
required
to
file
the
very
law
suit
which
now
before
your
honors.
and
additional
basis
for
the
decision
of
the
district
court
appears
to
have
been
a
reliance
upon
mr.
justice
stone's
distinction
made
in
hague
versus
cio
that
no
jurisdiction
lies
under
the
civil
rights
act
where
the
complaint
raises
only
questions
relating
to
property
rights
and
not
to
personal
rights
incapable
of
valuation.
we
believe
that
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court
have
satisfied
this
question
that
jurisdiction
does
lie
under
the
section
1343(3)
whether
it
is
denial
of
welfare
benefits,
since
it
had
been
recognized
that
such
a
denial
does
involve
important
aspects
of
personal
liberty.
therefore
we
urge
that
the
district
court
urge
in
dismissing
the
complaint
on
this
ground.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
yes,
the
action
was
brought
under
section
1983.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
1343(3)
and
(4)
both
were
invoked
to
support
the
jurisdiction.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
that
claim
was
made
in
briefs
filed
before
the
district
court
your
honor.
primarily
upon
the
basis
of
case
of
nicole
versus
shapiro.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
we
find
that
the
entry
to
be
rather
obtained
on
head
ground,
your
honor.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
as
far
as
we
are
able
to
determine
that
is
the
only
ground
that
could
have
been
mr.
chief
justice
brennan
the
hague
issue
was
brief.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
nicole
versus
shapiro
was
the
primary
case
relied
upon
by
the
defendants
below.
at
that
the
time
the
second
--
mr.
jon
d.
noland
that
is
a
second
circuit
case
which
took
--
mr.
jon
d.
noland
i
do
not
believe
so.
the
second
circuit
in
that
case
took
a
very
restrictive
position
in
applying
the
hague
versus
cio
distinction.
since
then
for
example
in
the
eisen
case,
mr.
justice
finley
[ph]
has
recognized
that
welfare
actions
do
involve
important
aspects
of
personal
liberty.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
no
sir.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
i
do
not
believe
so.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
that
is
the
eisen
case,
eisen
versus
eastman
in
421
federal
second.
certiorari
was
denied
in
400
us.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
in
addition,
the
another
three-judge
panel
in
the
second
circuit
in
johnson
versus
harder
in
438
f.2d
did
recognize
that
jurisdiction
does
exist
under
section
1343
and
welfare
action.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
that
was
johnson
versus
harder
mr.
justice
brennan
438
fed
second.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
yes
sir.
we
see
no
other
basis
for
the
district
courtâ€™s
decision
on
the
1343
point
other
than
the
hague
versus
cio
distinction.
on
these
grounds
therefore,
we
believe
that
this
court
properly
has
jurisdiction
over
this
appeal
under
section
1253.
that
the
complaint
did
raise
substantial
constitutional
questions
which
were
neither
frivolous
nor
faithfully
absurd
on
the
basis
of
this
courtâ€™s
prior
decisions.
that
the
plaintiffs
were
not
required
to
exhaust
their
state
administrative
remedies
and
as
the
district
court
adds
jurisdiction
under
section
1343.
for
these
reasons
we
urge
that
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
be
reversed
and
that
the
case
be
remanded
for
full
trial
on
the
merits.
i
would
like
to
reserve
any
remaining
time
for
rebuttal
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
the
fact
is
mr.
justice
brennan
that
several
other
witnesses
did
testified
that
they
received
aid
within
the
six
month
period.
two
of
the
witnesses,
two
of
the
claimants
--
one
of
the
claimants
or
plaintiffs
and
one
witness
were
denied
aid
until
the
full
expiration
of
the
six
month
period.
this
is
said
forth
on
page
8
of
appellants
brief.
the
claimant
bowman
filed
four
applications.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
that
is
correct.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
that
it
would
be
our
position,
your
honor.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
the
plaintiff
bowman
did
receive
aid
after
six
months.
the
witnesses
luke
was
denied
aid
for
six
months
and
she
began
receiving
assistance
automatically
upon
the
expiration
of
the
six
month
period.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
unless
circumstances
have
changed.
one
of
the
witnesses
for
example
had
found
a
job
in
the
inter
period
and
did
not
pursue
it
any
further
after
the
six
month
period.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
that
is
correct.
with
respect
to
the
time
requirements
for
the
administrative
proceedings
brought
out
by
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
record
is
very
sparse
on
this
question.
there
is
no
doubt
that
what
the
statute
and
regulations
require
that
hearings
be
handled
very
expeditiously.
however,
the
two
week
period
even
from
the
limited
evidence
in
this
record
is
obviously
not
followed.
on
page
28
of
the
appendix
for
example,
in
response
to
an
interrogatory,
mr.
sterick
the
state
administrator
stated
that
an
appeal
was
held
on
december
19,
1969
and
the
decision
was
released
on
april
9,
1970
substantially
more
than
a
two
week
period.
similarly,
the
only
witness
who
took
administrative
review
testified
at
page
110
of
the
appendix
that
the
decision
was
rendered
by
the
state
on
december
29
or
september
29,
1970
and
the
hearing
was
held
on
august
27,
1970.
again,
substantially
more
than
a
two
week.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
congress
desired
to
enact
such
a
statute.
we
would
find
no
moral
weapon.
the
point
is
--
mr.
jon
d.
noland
i
would
think
the
state
or
the
administrator
would
find
that
to
be
a
continued
absence.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
no,
your
honor
we
object
the
showing
exceptional
circumstances
of
need
which
we
believe
constitutes
a
denial
of
equal
protection
and
also
a
contrary
to
the
social
security
act.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
that
is
correct
but
you
do
not
have
to
show
exceptional
circumstances
of
need.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
whatever
that
requirement
means,
it
certainly
must
mean
more
than
plain
need.
and
we
object
to
it
on
that
ground.
furthermore,
with
respect
to
the
doctrine
of
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies,
appellants
would
again
urge
that
the
administrative
remedy
in
this
case
was
not
adequate.
we
heard
talk
again
of
discovery
and
yet
the
record
in
this
very
case
shows
that
any
discovery
effort
at
the
administrative
level
would
be
feudal
because
the
state
department
has
already
told
us
that
we
must
obtain
the
court
order
in
order
to
obtain
the
documents
requested.
if
it
stated
in
monroe
versus
pape,
and
in
the
mcneese
case,
section
1983
does
truly
constitute
a
remedy
supplementary
to
any
state
remedy
and
we
believe
that
that
must
be
construed
as
granting
an
exemption
from
exhaustion
either
of
administrative
or
of
your
state
judicial
remedies.
in
addition
of
course,
there
are
important
federal
questions
involved
in
this
case.
we
are
talking
about
essentially
federal
program
under
the
social
security
act.
we
are
talking
about
challenges
to
a
state
regulation
that
has
been
invalid
on
space
and
has
applied,
and
we
believe
it
is
appropriate
in
the
case
of
this
nature
for
those
decisions
to
be
made
for
an
impartial
tribunal.
we
see
no
need
to
exhaust
state
administrative
remedies
in
such
a
case.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
direct
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
three-judges
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
indiana
which
dismissed
appellants
complaint
for
failure
of
federal
jurisdiction.
the
issues
involved
are
jurisdiction
of
questions
pertaining
both
to
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
to
hear
the
appeal
under
section
1253
of
the
judicial
code
and
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
three-judge
district
court.
the
plaintiffs
in
this
action
were
mothers
of
dependent
children
to
at
the
time
of
filing
their
complaint
in
the
district
court
had
been
denied
either
the
right
to
file
an
application
for
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children
or
had
been
denied
assistance
under
that
program.
jurisdiction
below
was
founded
on
section
1343(3)
and
(4)
of
the
united
states
code
and
the
action
was
brought
under
section
1
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1871.
plaintiffs
brought
the
action
on
their
own
behalf
and
as
a
class
action
on
behalf
of
other
mothers
similarly
situated.
the
social
security
act
defines
a
dependant
child
as
a
needy
child
who
has
been
deprived
of
parental
care
or
support
by
reason
of
the
continued
absence
from
the
home
of
a
parent.
plaintiffs
alleged
that
they
were
entitled
to
assistance
under
this
provision
because
their
husbands
and
the
fathers
to
their
children
had
deserted
the
home.
plaintiffs
also
alleged
in
their
complaint
that
aid
under
this
provision
was
denied
pursuant
to
indiana
regulation
2402(b)
which
is
set
forth
at
the
bottom
of
page
5
of
appellants
brief.
this
regulations
state
when
the
continued
absence
is
due
to
desertion
or
separation.
the
absence
shall
have
been
continuous
for
a
period
of
at
least
six
months
prior
to
the
date
of
application
for
assistance
except
that
under
exceptional
circumstances
of
need
and
where
it
is
determined
that
the
absence
of
apparent
is
actual
and
bonafiding,
an
application
maybe
filed
and
a
child
maybe
considered
immediately
eligible
upon
a
special
finding
of
the
county
department
of
welfare.
a
three-judge
court
was
convened
to
hear
the
plaintiffs
allegation
that
this
regulation
was
not
only
unconstitutional,
but
was
also
contrary
to
provisions
of
the
social
security
act.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
yes
it
was
brought
as
a
class
action
your
honor.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
that
is
right.
mothers
who
had
been
denied
welfare
benefits
under
this
regulation
because
the
husband
had
not
been
away
from
the
home
for
a
period
of
six
months.
following
the
convening
of
the
three-judge
court,
each
of
the
two
appellees,
the
county
department
of
public
welfare
and
the
state
department
of
public
welfare
filed
motions
to
dismiss
the
complaint.
these
motions
were
based
primarily
on
two
grounds.
one,
a
failure
on
the
part
of
the
plaintiffs
to
exhaust
their
state
administrative
remedies,
and
secondly
the
failure
of
the
complaint
to
raise
substantial
constitutional
questions.
the
three-judge
panel
then
convened
a
combine
hearing
both
on
the
motions
to
dismiss
and
on
the
merits
of
the
case.
evidence
was
heard
from
approximately
16
witnesses
and
at
that
point
the
court
adjourned
the
hearing
and
granted
the
motions
to
dismiss.
the
court's
entry
appears
at
page
210
of
the
appendix
and
on
page
212
of
the
entry.
the
entry
demonstrates
that
the
decision
of
the
court
was
based
one
upon
the
court's
finding
that
each
of
the
plaintiffs
had
failed
to
exhaust
their
state
administrative
remedies,
and
secondly,
the
court
held
we
have
examined
the
pleadings
before
us
and
find
no
substantial
federal
question
involved
nor
do
we
find
federal
jurisdiction
under
28
us(c)
section
1343(3)
and
(4).
it
is
apparent
to
the
appellants
from
this
entry
that
the
district
court
resolved
none
of
the
conflicts
in
testimony
which
became
evident
during
the
course
of
the
hearing.
rather,
it
made
it
so
finding
that
the
plaintiffs
had
failed
to
exhaust
state
administrative
remedies
and
then
on
the
basis
of
the
pleadings
and
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
pleadings,
it
found
that
no
substantial
federal
questions
were
presented
for
decision.
before
turning
to
the
correctness
of
the
decision
of
the
district
court,
the
appellee,
the
state
department
of
public
welfare
has
raised
a
threshold
question
in
this
case
pertaining
to
this
court's
jurisdiction
under
section
1253
of
the
judicial
code.
as
we
understand
the
argument,
the
appellants
and
the
appelleeâ€™s
contention
is
that
in
failing
to
find
substantial
federal
question,
the
three-judge
panel
in
effect
dissolved
itself
and
that
therefore
the
final
entry
should
be
construed
as
having
been
the
decision
of
a
single
district
judge.
in
support
of
that
decision
the
appellee
relies
primarily
upon
two
per
curium
decisions
of
this
court.
mengelkoch
versus
wilson,
mengelkoch
versus
the
industrial
welfare
commission
and
wilson
versus
city
of
port
lavaca.
without
repeating
all
of
the
argument
set
forth
in
appellants
reply
brief,
we
believe
that
this
case
is
significantly
different
from
those
decisions
and
that
here
there
was
no
express
finding
by
the
three-judge
panel
that
it
had
been
improperly
convened.
the
final
decision
in
fact
was
entered
by
all
three-judges.
in
addition,
it
is
apparent
from
the
entry
that
in
large
part,
the
decision
of
the
district
court
was
based
upon
the
failure
to
exhaust
state
administrative
remedies.
and
as
we
read
this
courts
decision
in
idlewild
liquor
corporation
against
epstein
that
is
a
consideration
which
could
be
properly
made
only
by
three-judge
court
and
not
by
a
single
district
judge.
furthermore
the
court
here
convened
the
hearing
on
the
merits
as
well
upon
the
motion
to
dismiss
and
took
extensive
evidence
from
approximately
16
witnesses.
again,
we
submit
that
this
is
a
procedure
which
could
be
followed
followed
only
by
the
three-judge
court.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
it
is
certainly
conceivable
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
three-judge
panel
could
have
heard
witnesses
and
decided
on
the
basis
of
the
testimony
induce
that
the
complaint
failed
to
raise
substantial
constitutional
questions
and
dissolve
itself
and
then
left
the
final
judgment
for
single
district
judge.
by
not
doing
so,
we
believe
the
district
court
here
recognized
in
fact
that
it
was
not
making
a
determination.
within
the
meaning
of,
for
example
ex
parte
poreski
(ph)
that
the
complaint
failed
to
raise
substantial
constitutional
questions,
but
made
that
decision
on
the
basis
of
a
finding
of
a
failure
to
exhaust
state
administrative
remedies.
we
submit
that
what
has
happened
here
is
the
district
court
has
taken
this
court's
decision
in
king
versus
smith
and
turned
the
formula
around
and
said
in
this
case
substantial
constitutional
questions
are
not
raised
because
there
was
a
failure
to
exhaust
state
administrative
remedies,
and
we
submit
that
that
is
a
determination
which
could
made
only
by
the
three-judge
court.
in
support
of
appellants
position
on
this
point,
we
believe
the
recent
decision
of
this
court
on
october
12
of
this
year
in
a
case
of
hicks
versus
pleasure
house,
inc.
is
instructive
or
in
that
decision,
the
court
characterized
the
wilson
decision
and
the
mengelkoch
decision
as
holding
that
an
appeal
may
lie
to
a
court
of
appeals
from
certain
action
of
a
single
district
judge
in
a
case
required
to
be
heard
by
three-judges.
and
again
here
we
have
no
action
of
a
single
district
judge,
but
a
final
appealable
judgment
entered
by
the
three-judge
court.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
we
believe
that
this
court
has
jurisdiction
over
that
direct
opinion.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
that
as
we
understand
the
decisions
of
this
court
following
wilson
versus
mengelkoch,
there
are
series
of
four
decisions
cited
in
appellants
reply
brief
in
which
that
procedure
was
followed,
and
in
which
this
court
took
jurisdiction
on
direct
appeal.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
that
is
the
mengelkoch
case
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
the
three-judge
court
--
mr.
jon
d.
noland
dissolved
itself
and
final
judgment
was
rendered
by
a
single
district
judge.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
that
is
correct.
turning
now
to
the
precise
nature
of
attacks
on
the
regulation
below.
appellants
have
attacked
the
regulation
at
the
bottom
of
page
5
of
their
brief,
both
on
constitutional
and
statutory
grounds.
two
attacks
were
made
on
the
basis
of
the
regulation
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
the
first
attack
relates
to
the
requirement
that
where
the
separation
has
been
for
a
period
of
less
than
six
months.
exceptional
circumstances
of
need
must
be
shown
in
order
to
secure
a
waiver.
we
see
no
rational
basis
for
saying
that
if
the
separation
has
been
for
less
than
six
months,
a
child
must
be
exceptionally
needy.
while
if
the
separation
has
been
for
more
than
six
months
mere
need
is
sufficient.
therefore,
we
argue
below
that
this
particular
provision
of
the
regulation
constituted
a
denial
of
equal
protection
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
do
not
believe
that
this
question
is
rendered
in
substantial
or
frivolous
by
the
court's
decision
in
dandridge
against
williams.
we
have
an
entirely
different
factual
situation,
a
different
type
regulation
in
this
case.
a
regulation
under
which
the
appellant
and
other
applicants
have
been
denied
all
aid.
we
do
not
have
here
a
maximum
grant
type
regulation
where
the
families
are
already
receiving
some
type
of
assistance
and
a
maximum
level
is
established.
secondly,
the
appellants
have
attacked
the
regulation
on
its
face
as
granting
a
standard
list
and
arbitrary
discretion
to
the
administrator.
as
pointed
out,
in
order
to
secure
a
waiver
of
the
six
months
requirement,
a
special
finding
must
be
made
by
the
county
department
of
public
welfare.
two
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
alleged
in
the
complaint
that
no
investigation
had
been
made
into
their
circumstances
upon
which
such
a
special
finding
could
be
based.
on
this
basis,
we
believe
the
administrator
has
discretion
as
to
whether
to
conduct
an
investigation
in
any
particular
case.
the
discretion
which
is
not
guided
by
any
standards.
furthermore,
whether
it
is
a
failure
to
conduct
an
investigation,
the
regulation
in
effect
enacts
and
concludes
the
presumption
that
an
absence
for
less
than
six
months
cannot
be
a
continuous
absence.
in
these
particular
cases
therefore,
we
have
a
rigid
six
month
waiting
period
and
the
same
type
of
regulation
or
statute
which
was
involved
in
the
damico
case
and
in
the
minnesota
case
of
bill
versus
hersh
(ph).
mr.
jon
d.
noland
both
of
those
periods
were
three
month
periods
your
honor.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
both
statute
where
struck
down
as
being
contrary
to
social
security
act
although
the
court,
each
court
conceded
that
the
constitutional
claims
raise
were
substantial.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
we
believe
that
any
time
period
--
mr.
jon
d.
noland
that
is
correct
your
honor,
obviously
situations
will
vary,
in
some
cases
the
administrator
maybe
able
to
reach
a
determination
that
if
absences
continued
two
or
three
days
after
the
husband
departs.
in
other
cases,
it
may
take
longer
to
arrive
at
that
determination.
we
do
believe
--
mr.
jon
d.
noland
i
am
suggesting
and
no
your
honor
that
it
would
not
be
unconstitutional
but
anything
above
that
would
be
a
violation
of
the
social
security
act.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
that
is
correct.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
that
is
correct.
i
think
our
primary
problem
with
this
regulation
is
relating
the
exceptional
circumstances
of
need
requirement
to
a
durational
requirement.
we
could
see
no
rational
basis
for
saying
that
even
though
it
maybe
difficult
to
arrive
at
a
determination
of
continued
absence
that
a
waiver
will
be
granted
only
if
exceptional
circumstances
of
need
are
present.
we
believe
that
violates
social
security
act
which
speaks
of
needy
children
and
not
exceptionally
needy
children.
in
addition,
the
appellants
have
alleged
in
their
complaint
that
there
is
a
statewide
policy
in
practice
under
this
regulation
of
requiring
applicants
to
file
for
legal
separation
or
divorce
in
order
to
secure
a
waiver
of
the
six
month
period.
the
testimony
before
the
three-judge
panel
on
this
question
was
directly
conflicting.
there
was
evidence
on
behalf
of
plaintiffs
that
such
a
practice
had
been
engaged
in,
at
least
in
their
cases
and
in
other
cases.
the
administrators
on
the
other
hand
denied
the
existence
of
any
such
practice.
as
we
think
as
apparent
from
the
court's
entry,
the
court
they
know
fact
finding
as
to
whether
this
practice
did
or
did
not
exist.
apparently,
assume
the
existence
of
the
practice
and
yet
nevertheless
found
that
the
constitutional
issue
is
raised
for
insubstantial.
appellants
urge
that
such
practice
that
exist
as
alleged
constitutes
denial
of
first
amendment
and
the
equal
protection
clause
of
fourteenth
amendment.
turning
now
to
the
question
of
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies,
we
think
this
is
the
primary
basis
for
the
decision
of
the
district
court.
as
appellants
have
read,
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court
there
is
an
absolute
exemption
from
any
exhaustion
requirement
or
actions
brought
under
the
civil
rights
act.
this
is
been
established
both
by
the
damico
versus
california
and
king
versus
smith.
we
submit
that
there
is
important
policy
justification
for
such
an
exemption.
cases
such
as
this
under
the
civil
rights
act
and
particularly
welfare
cases
involve
essentially
or
primarily
questions
of
federal
law
whether
the
constitutional
law
or
statutory
law.
we
see
no
need
therefore
for
the
state
administrator
to
consider
state
law
to
make
any
fact
finding
based
on
the
record
before
an
administrative
agency
or
to
apply
their
expertise
or
discretion.
the
regulation
here
is
being
attacked
both
on
its
face
and
does
apply.
we
believe
these
issues
can
properly
be
determined
by
a
federal
court
without
exhaustion.
in
addition,
if
exhaustion
is
to
be
required
in
certain
cases
we
submit
that
this
is
not
such
a
case
because
the
administrative
remedy
is
inadequate.
there
is
no
identical
administrative
remedy
in
indiana.
that
remedy
is
solely
individual
in
nature,
there
is
no
class
action
procedure
before
the
administrative
agency.
in
addition
that
an
administrative
appeal
does
not
result
in
any
decision
of
general
applicability
throughout
the
state.
now
the
appellee's
state
department
in
this
has
devoted
a
large
portion
of
its
brief
to
arguing
that
full
discovery
rights
are
available
in
administrative
proceedings
in
indiana.
the
appellants
do
not
dispute
that
proposition
as
a
matter
of
statute
but
law.
however,
the
very
record
in
this
case
demonstrates
that
any
pursuit
of
discovery
before
the
administrative
agency
would
be
entirely
feudal.
the
plaintiffs
below
filed
both
subpoenas
and
motions
to
produce
to
obtain
copies
of
case
files
and
other
documents
pertaining
to
the
application
of
the
challenge
regulation.
both
the
state
department
and
the
county
department
resisted
any
motion
to
produce
on
the
basis
that
the
records
requested
were
confidential
in
nature.
and
in
a
letter
to
the
court
and
to
council
dated
november
5,
1970
state
welfare
department
stated,
i
specifically
request
that
you
obtain
a
court
order
to
require
mr.
sterick
(ph)
to
produce
these
files
at
the
time
of
his
proposed
examination.
the
county
welfare
department
said
essentially
the
same
thing
in
an
affidavit
filed
in
support
of
their
objection.
now
it
is
essential
in
case
such
as
this
that
the
plaintiffs
have
access
to
the
documents
in
order
to
establish
their
constitutional
allegations
that
this
regulation
has
been
applied
in
such
a
manner
as
to
be
contrary
to
the
equal
protection
clause.
yet
the
appellees
have
told
us
in
this
very
case
that
they
will
require
a
court
order
in
order
to
produce
the
documents
requested.
appellants
know
of
no
procedure
in
indiana
whereby
a
court
order
can
be
obtained
without
filing
a
law
suit.
therefore
we
submit,
we
are
back
right
where
we
started
from.
the
appellants
would
receive
none
of
the
documents
in
an
administrative
proceeding
and
would
be
required
to
file
the
very
law
suit
which
now
before
your
honors.
and
additional
basis
for
the
decision
of
the
district
court
appears
to
have
been
a
reliance
upon
mr.
justice
stone's
distinction
made
in
hague
versus
cio
that
no
jurisdiction
lies
under
the
civil
rights
act
where
the
complaint
raises
only
questions
relating
to
property
rights
and
not
to
personal
rights
incapable
of
valuation.
we
believe
that
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court
have
satisfied
this
question
that
jurisdiction
does
lie
under
the
section
1343(3)
whether
it
is
denial
of
welfare
benefits,
since
it
had
been
recognized
that
such
a
denial
does
involve
important
aspects
of
personal
liberty.
therefore
we
urge
that
the
district
court
urge
in
dismissing
the
complaint
on
this
ground.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
yes,
the
action
was
brought
under
section
1983.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
1343(3)
and
(4)
both
were
invoked
to
support
the
jurisdiction.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
that
claim
was
made
in
briefs
filed
before
the
district
court
your
honor.
primarily
upon
the
basis
of
case
of
nicole
versus
shapiro.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
we
find
that
the
entry
to
be
rather
obtained
on
head
ground,
your
honor.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
as
far
as
we
are
able
to
determine
that
is
the
only
ground
that
could
have
been
mr.
chief
justice
brennan
the
hague
issue
was
brief.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
nicole
versus
shapiro
was
the
primary
case
relied
upon
by
the
defendants
below.
at
that
the
time
the
second
--
mr.
jon
d.
noland
that
is
a
second
circuit
case
which
took
--
mr.
jon
d.
noland
i
do
not
believe
so.
the
second
circuit
in
that
case
took
a
very
restrictive
position
in
applying
the
hague
versus
cio
distinction.
since
then
for
example
in
the
eisen
case,
mr.
justice
finley
[ph]
has
recognized
that
welfare
actions
do
involve
important
aspects
of
personal
liberty.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
no
sir.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
i
do
not
believe
so.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
that
is
the
eisen
case,
eisen
versus
eastman
in
421
federal
second.
certiorari
was
denied
in
400
us.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
in
addition,
the
another
three-judge
panel
in
the
second
circuit
in
johnson
versus
harder
in
438
f.2d
did
recognize
that
jurisdiction
does
exist
under
section
1343
and
welfare
action.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
that
was
johnson
versus
harder
mr.
justice
brennan
438
fed
second.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
yes
sir.
we
see
no
other
basis
for
the
district
courtâ€™s
decision
on
the
1343
point
other
than
the
hague
versus
cio
distinction.
on
these
grounds
therefore,
we
believe
that
this
court
properly
has
jurisdiction
over
this
appeal
under
section
1253.
that
the
complaint
did
raise
substantial
constitutional
questions
which
were
neither
frivolous
nor
faithfully
absurd
on
the
basis
of
this
courtâ€™s
prior
decisions.
that
the
plaintiffs
were
not
required
to
exhaust
their
state
administrative
remedies
and
as
the
district
court
adds
jurisdiction
under
section
1343.
for
these
reasons
we
urge
that
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
be
reversed
and
that
the
case
be
remanded
for
full
trial
on
the
merits.
i
would
like
to
reserve
any
remaining
time
for
rebuttal
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
the
fact
is
mr.
justice
brennan
that
several
other
witnesses
did
testified
that
they
received
aid
within
the
six
month
period.
two
of
the
witnesses,
two
of
the
claimants
--
one
of
the
claimants
or
plaintiffs
and
one
witness
were
denied
aid
until
the
full
expiration
of
the
six
month
period.
this
is
said
forth
on
page
8
of
appellants
brief.
the
claimant
bowman
filed
four
applications.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
that
is
correct.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
that
it
would
be
our
position,
your
honor.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
the
plaintiff
bowman
did
receive
aid
after
six
months.
the
witnesses
luke
was
denied
aid
for
six
months
and
she
began
receiving
assistance
automatically
upon
the
expiration
of
the
six
month
period.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
unless
circumstances
have
changed.
one
of
the
witnesses
for
example
had
found
a
job
in
the
inter
period
and
did
not
pursue
it
any
further
after
the
six
month
period.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
that
is
correct.
with
respect
to
the
time
requirements
for
the
administrative
proceedings
brought
out
by
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
record
is
very
sparse
on
this
question.
there
is
no
doubt
that
what
the
statute
and
regulations
require
that
hearings
be
handled
very
expeditiously.
however,
the
two
week
period
even
from
the
limited
evidence
in
this
record
is
obviously
not
followed.
on
page
28
of
the
appendix
for
example,
in
response
to
an
interrogatory,
mr.
sterick
the
state
administrator
stated
that
an
appeal
was
held
on
december
19,
1969
and
the
decision
was
released
on
april
9,
1970
substantially
more
than
a
two
week
period.
similarly,
the
only
witness
who
took
administrative
review
testified
at
page
110
of
the
appendix
that
the
decision
was
rendered
by
the
state
on
december
29
or
september
29,
1970
and
the
hearing
was
held
on
august
27,
1970.
again,
substantially
more
than
a
two
week.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
congress
desired
to
enact
such
a
statute.
we
would
find
no
moral
weapon.
the
point
is
--
mr.
jon
d.
noland
i
would
think
the
state
or
the
administrator
would
find
that
to
be
a
continued
absence.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
no,
your
honor
we
object
the
showing
exceptional
circumstances
of
need
which
we
believe
constitutes
a
denial
of
equal
protection
and
also
a
contrary
to
the
social
security
act.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
that
is
correct
but
you
do
not
have
to
show
exceptional
circumstances
of
need.
mr.
jon
d.
noland
whatever
that
requirement
means,
it
certainly
must
mean
more
than
plain
need.
and
we
object
to
it
on
that
ground.
furthermore,
with
respect
to
the
doctrine
of
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies,
appellants
would
again
urge
that
the
administrative
remedy
in
this
case
was
not
adequate.
we
heard
talk
again
of
discovery
and
yet
the
record
in
this
very
case
shows
that
any
discovery
effort
at
the
administrative
level
would
be
feudal
because
the
state
department
has
already
told
us
that
we
must
obtain
the
court
order
in
order
to
obtain
the
documents
requested.
if
it
stated
in
monroe
versus
pape,
and
in
the
mcneese
case,
section
1983
does
truly
constitute
a
remedy
supplementary
to
any
state
remedy
and
we
believe
that
that
must
be
construed
as
granting
an
exemption
from
exhaustion
either
of
administrative
or
of
your
state
judicial
remedies.
in
addition
of
course,
there
are
important
federal
questions
involved
in
this
case.
we
are
talking
about
essentially
federal
program
under
the
social
security
act.
we
are
talking
about
challenges
to
a
state
regulation
that
has
been
invalid
on
space
and
has
applied,
and
we
believe
it
is
appropriate
in
the
case
of
this
nature
for
those
decisions
to
be
made
for
an
impartial
tribunal.
we
see
no
need
to
exhaust
state
administrative
remedies
in
such
a
case.
