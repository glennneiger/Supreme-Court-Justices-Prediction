this
a
class
action?
chief

could
that
not
also
mean
that
having
heard
16
witnesses
conceivably,
it
concluded
that
there
was
no
problem
for
three-judge
court?
i
am
not
suggesting
it
was,
but
could
that
not
also
be
an
explanation?
chief
justice

you
suggesting
that

be
unconstitutional?

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
arguing
that
this
then
was
in
fact
the
action
was
legally,
the
action
of
a
single
judge
even
though
three
reported
take
part
in
it?
chief

you

not
sure
that
is
crucial.

too
much

it
seems
at

that
judge
turner
thought
that
it
was
important
enough
to
have
three
signatures
on
the
disposing
order
because
he
authorized
one
of
the
other
two
judges
to
sign
for
him
or
at

to
that

it
would
look
as

the

were
thinking
that
they
were
a
three-judge
court.

that
one
of
