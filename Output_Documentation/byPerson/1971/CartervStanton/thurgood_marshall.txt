justice
thurgood
marshall
there
are
also
cases
where
the
three-judges
found
there
was
a
substantial
federal
question
dissolved
it
and
then
one
judge
rendered
the
opinion
all
on
the
same
day?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
think
of
another
one,
but
i
mean
that
was
not
definitely
the
single
judge
action.
justice
thurgood
marshall
dissolved
itself?
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
done
in
the
same
proceedings.
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
the
argument
says
the
motion
of
the
defendant
to
dismiss
its
complaint
is
hereby
granted.
would
that
be
alright?
it
is
signed
by
the
three-judges?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
would
that
be
alright?
one
thing
i
left
out
is
to
say,
the
federal
jurisdiction
that
is
all
i
left
out.
but
you
apply
for
an
injunction
and
the
grant
dismiss
your
complaint
that
thereby
denying
injunction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
say
that
that
is
not
ground
for
appeal
to
this
court.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
one,
when
they
had
hearing,
and
how
many
witnesses,
16
witnesses.
that
is
not
summary
judgment.
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible).
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
said
the
(inaudible)
did
not
dismiss
for
failure
of
federal
jurisdiction.
why
is
then
effective
order
of
a
three-judge
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
it
that
just
as
effective
as
granting
an
injunction?
and
find
the
jurisdiction
and
granting
an
injunction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
is
the
difference
between
finding
a
jurisdiction
and
granting
an
injunction
one
hand?
not
finding
jurisdiction
and
not
granting
an
injunction
or
denying
the
injunction
on
the
other
hand?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
you
mean
the
court
has
to
say
the
motion
but
the
defendant
dismissed
complaint
for
failure
of
federal
jurisdiction
is
hereby
granted
and
the
application
for
an
injunction
is
denied?
would
that
be
okay?
justice
thurgood
marshall
injunction
or
the
motion
for
an
injunction
is
denied
because
of
failure
of
federal
jurisdiction.
would
that
be
all
right?
are
you
not
just
fiddling
by
words?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
specific
administrative
review
would
allow
you
to
raise
the
question
of
the
unconstitutionality
of
that
statute
as
being
in
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
you
raise
that
question
and
have
it
decided
by
a
competent
body?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
does
he
place
running
to
a
lawyer
the
to
decide
this
question?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
i
mean
who
decides
it
all.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
he
a
lawyer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
can
he
decide
the
constitutionality
of
the
indiana
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
constitutional?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
he
make
a
finding
that
is
unconstitutional?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
under
his
oath?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
he
not
take
an
oath
to
support
the
laws
of
indiana?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
do
not
raise
that,
you
just
said
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
as
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
what
administrative
agency
in
indiana
is
capable
of
deciding
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
not
the
one
point
he
is
asking
for
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
we
have
passed
on
that
one.
justice
thurgood
marshall
at
that
time
would
it
be
moved,
would
it
not
take
six
months
to
get
passed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
heard
you
said
five
months
in
this
regard?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
when
the
exhaust
state
administrative
remedy,
how
long
that
take?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
long
does
it
takes
to
exhaust
all
the
way
up
to
that
two
state
boards?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean,
you
can
get
play
all
the
way
through
the
department
and
d
final
agency
in
the
state
of
indiana
in
five
weeks?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
never
seen
a
state
like
that
before
in
my
life.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
do
not
think
it
is
possible,
but
i
do
not
think
does
it
happen?
justice
thurgood
marshall
five
weeks.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
is
it,
they
come
from
some
trusty
or
somebody?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
if
it
so?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
statute
said
that
there
had
to
be
a
showing
that
the
spouse
had
left
without
any
idea
of
ever
returning.
(inaudible)
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
these
things
in
merit
in
the
argument
that
this
is
really
not
a
six
months
if
you
go
in
there
and
say
that
my
husband
left
last
night
with
a
one
trip
ticket
to
--
one
way
trip
to
moscow,
she
would
be
eligible.
that
is
what
i
understand
the
state's
condition.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
is
the
problem
now?
statute,
you
just
object
to
showing
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
really,
you
have
to
show
the
need
even
after
six
months?
justice
thurgood

that
is

that
