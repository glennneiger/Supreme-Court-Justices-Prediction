mr.
mark
peden
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
believe
that
this
appeal
belongs
in
the
seventh
circuit.
what
happened
in
this
case
was
the
single
judge
convened
the
three-judge
panel
that
heard
the
case
and
dismissed
it
entirely.
there
was
nothing
in
remain
to
be
done
by
a
single
judge
in
this
case.
we
rely
on
two
cases
discussed
by
mr.
noland,
wilson
versus
city
of
port
lavaca
and
mengelkoch
versus
industrial
commission,
those
two
cases,
three-judge
panel
dissolved
the
case
and
sent
it
back
to
single
dissolve
their
own
panel
and
sent
it
back
to
the
single
district
judge
for
resolution.
in
those
cases,
the
single
judge
dismissed
the
case
and
this
court
held
that
the
appeal
properly
went
to
the
seventh
circuit,
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
mr.
mark
peden
yes
sir.
it
is
our
opinion
that
the
--
mr.
mark
peden
we
would
not
be
able
to.
the
fact
that
we
are
going
on
here
is
that
to
remand
this
back
to
a
single
district
judge,
it
would
be
pedantic
and
useless
act
pointless
formality
where
there
is
nothing
left
to
be
done
by
a
single
judge.
three-judge
court
has
dismissed
the
case
in
its
entirety.
mr.
mark
peden
it
was
a
judgment
that
they
had
no
jurisdiction.
mr.
mark
peden
and
where
a
three-judge
court
dismisses
for
warrant
jurisdiction
it
appeals.
mr.
mark
peden
yes,
as
was
the
judgment
in
the
wilson
and
mengelkoch
and
more
recently
in
--
mr.
mark
peden
that
is
factual.
mr.
mark
peden
i
think
it
is
a
difference
without
any
consequence
and
to
make
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
under
section
1253
depend
on
a
simple
formality.
mr.
mark
peden
yes,
it
did.
mr.
mark
peden
that
arose
because
in
1875
after
federal
courts
were
given
jurisdiction
over
this
type
of
the
case
were
given
a
power
to
enjoin
state
statutes.
federal
judges
quite
freely
exercised
this
injunctive
power
and
public
resentment
reached
quite
a
peak
an
especially
after
decision
of
this
court
in
ex
parte
young
in
1908
where
the
power
of
the
federal
judge
is
to
enjoin
state
regulatory
scheme
was
upheld.
the
injunctions
where
often
granted
simply
on
the
basis
of
affidavits
in
ex
parte
proceedings.
the
public
resentment
were
such
that
congress
in
1910
passed
the
three-judge
act.
so
it
now
requires
three-judges
or
state
statute
can
be
struck
down
and
they
further
protected
the
state
interest
by
providing
that
any
appeal
should
go
direct
to
the
supreme
court.
so
the
whole
impetus
for
the
three-judge
act
was
to
protect
state
interest
from
interference
by
the
injunctive
power
of
federal
courts.
it
was
not
to
protect
parte
such
as
plaintiff
in
this
case.
mr.
mark
peden
yes,
in
order
granting
or
denying
it
is
mutual
in
that
sense
but
we
submit
that
the
thrust
of
the
act
did
not
encompass
situations
in
this
type.
mr.
mark
peden
i
think
your
honor
that
that
would
be
posted
what
happened
here.
mr.
mark
peden
well
--
mr.
mark
peden
your
honor
in
the
recent
case,
goldstein
versus
cox.
this
court
held
that
were
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
was
denied.
the
plaintiff's
most
of
the
summary
judgment
was
denied.
even
though
they
had
asked
for
an
injunction,
the
appeal
still
lay
to
the
court
of
appeals
that
was
goldstein
versus
cox.
mr.
mark
peden
well,
the
hearing
was
held
for
the
purpose
of
determining
jurisdiction.
mr.
mark
peden
as
they
say
determine
to
deny
jurisdiction.
mr.
mark
peden
why
is
it
the
effective
one?
mr.
mark
peden
well,
section
12
--
mr.
mark
peden
the
practical
difference
is
not
that
great
but
under
section
1253
that
is
a
technical
enactment
is
to
be
construed
very
narrowly
and
this
court
has
said
that
several
times
and
if
the
plaintiff
cannot
show
that
the
action
of
the
court
below
took
in
regard
to
his
case
was
such
as
the
constitute
in
order
denying
or
granting
injunctive
relief
and
come
within
that
language
very
literally,
then
he
is
out
of
ballpark
as
far
as
1253
goes.
even
though,
it
maybe
that
he
is
asked
for
an
injunction
and
he
has
not
got
it.
so
the
practical
effect
is
that
he
is
lacking
in
his
injunction
but
he
has
to
come
within
the
literal
strictures
of
1253.
mr.
mark
peden
if
the
thrust
of
the
decision
was
a
decision
on
the
merits
of
the
merits
of
the
case.
appeal
would
go
to
the
supreme
court
under
section
1253.
mr.
mark
peden
words
are
the
essence
of
1253
jurisdiction.
mr.
mark
peden
we
believe
that
the
indiana
six
month
requirement
is
not
violated
of
the
equal
protection
because
it
is
found
it
in
rationality.
in
the
previous
case,
the
court
had
difficulty
distinguishing
between
the
college
student
and
a
vocational
student.
but
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
under
a
six
month
requirement,
the
standard
or
the
continued
absence
is
going
to
be
a
lot
more
clear.
the
longer
the
parent
is
absent
from
the
house.
the
six
month
requirement
is
founded
in
the
common
sense
belief
that
when
a
father
leaves
a
family,
it
would
be
very
likely
that
the
standard
of
need,
soon
after
the
father
leaves
is
not
as
grace
it
will
be
later.
the
regulation
also
contains
a
clause
which
states
that
in
cases
of
exceptional
circumstances
aid
maybe
available.
this
clause
means
that
when
--
since
standard,
the
evidence
below
indicate
that
the
standard
of
need
that
recall
for
a
family
for
aid
after
six
months
was
the
same
as
used
by
the
welfare
department
in
a
determination
of
who
met
exceptional
circumstances
before
six
months.
the
basis
of
the
ruling
is
that
when
a
man
leaves
the
house,
there
will
be
some
money
or
the
family
would
be
able
to
at
least
subsist
for
a
length
of
time,
and
that
it
is
necessary
in
order
to
prevent
fraud
in
order
to
ensure
that
the
continued
absence
is
real.
now,
it
is
our
position
that
this
does
not
violate
equal
protection
because
under
the
dandridge
case,
the
court
noted
that
the
test
of
such
a
regulation
is
whether
or
not
it
is
reasonable,
whether
or
not
it
is
brief
in
various
discrimination.
the
afdc
program
was
described
as
a
program
of
cooperative
federalism.
the
states
have
leeway
and
under
the
statutory
argument,
aside
from
the
equal
protection
argument,
it
is
our
position
that
406
as
a
definition
is
not
mandatory
in
binding
up
on
the
states.
this
is
already
brought
out
in
the
last
case
to
quite
an
extent.
we
feel
that
the
requirements
that
are
binding
upon
the
state
as
suggested
by
the
solicitor
general
are
in
section
402.
these
requirements
have
been
settled
with
effective
dates
whereby
in
order
to
meet
these
requirements,
the
states
have
to
comply
by
a
certain
date.
whereas
section
406,
the
definitional
section
are
no
effective
dates.
this
in
busy
just
then
that
the
real
requirements
of
the
act.
the
ones
which
would
require
the
states
to
perhaps
enact
legislation
that
will
enable
them
to
meet
the
requirements
that
section
402
is
a
section
which
actually
establishes
binding
requirements
on
the
state
and
legislative
history
of
this
act
fully
supports
this,
all
the
remarks
in
the
senate
reports
cited
by
the
solicitor
generalâ€™s
brief
in
this
case,
amply
support
the
view
that
section
406
establishes
the
outer
boundaries
of
state
participation
for
which
federal
funding
will
be
available.
and
that
section
402
is
the
only
of
section
of
the
act
which
is
mandatory
upon
the
states.
section
402(b)
states
that
the
secretary
will
approve
any
plan
which
complies
with
that
section
meaning
402
and
the
requirements
in
402(a).
it
does
not
say
that
the
secretary
will
refuse
to
approve
plans
because
a
fail
to
commit
the
definitional
requirements
in
section
406.
so
we
submit
that
on
the
basis
of
standards
case,
there
is
no
conflict
with
equal
protection
under
the
six
month
rule
and
then
upon
the
basis
of
the
legislative
background
and
the
internal
consistency
of
the
social
security
act,
there
is
no
conflict
with
that
act
neither.

this
act
fully
supports
this,
all
the
remarks
in
the
senate
reports
cited
by
the
solicitor
generalâ€™s
brief
in
this
case,
amply
support
the
view
that
section
406
establishes
the
outer
boundaries
of
state
participation
for
which
federal
funding
will
be
available.
and
that
section
402
is
the
only
of
section
of
the
act
which
is
mandatory
upon
the
states.
section
402(b)
states
that
the
secretary
will
approve
any
plan
which
complies
with
that
section
meaning
402
and
the
requirements
in
402(a).
it
does
not
say
that
the
secretary
will
refuse
to
approve
plans
because
a
fail
to
commit
the
definitional
requirements
in
section
406.
so
we
submit
that
on
the
basis
of
standards
case,
there
is
no
conflict
with
equal
protection
under
the
six
month
rule
and
then
upon
the
basis
of
the
legislative
background
and
the
internal
consistency
of
the
social
security
act,
there
is
no
conflict
with
that
act
neither.
thank
you,
the
rest
of
time
will
be
taken
by
my
partner
mr.
geddes.
