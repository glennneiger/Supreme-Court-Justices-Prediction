justice
byron
r.
white
which
way
did
we
decide
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
the
double
bar
i
guess?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
didn't
we
decide
that
the
litigant
could
be
forced
to
protect
the
landlord
against
loss
of
rent?
justice
byron
r.
white
protect
the
landlord
against
loss,
so
he
would
have
to
pay
money
in
the
court,
to
protect
the
landlord
against
the
loss
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
was
protecting
the
landlord
against
the
financial
loss
from
the
litigation?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right,
and
the
court
yeah,
and
the
only
reason
to
do
was
protect
the
landlord
from
economic
loss?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
it's
just
not
unconstitutional
or
that
it's
unconstitutional
for
the
state
to
insist
that
litigants
protect
those
who
may
sue
against
the
cost
the
parties
will
incur
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
where
the
plaintiff
at
least
as
an
indigent?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
the
state
would
also
have
to
relieve
non-indigents
from
the
obligation
to
pay
the
other
party's
cost?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
did.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well
did
you
ask
for
a
waiver?
justice
byron
r.
white
without
specific,
they
were
asking
for
waiver
to
the
customer.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
there
a
bond
that
when
you
file
it,
does
it
automatically
collected
on,
and
say
the
appellant
files
it
and
loses?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
happens
to
it
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it's
not
a
--
$75
dollars
automatically,
does
it
go
to
the
appellee?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
there
is
no
appeal,
there
is
no
enactment
test
in
nebraska
which
--
and
if
that
statute
had
been
in
effect,
you
wouldn't
be
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
would
you
think
--
is
that
act--
would
that
act
be
applicable
or
of
any
relief
if
this
case
were
remanded
for
reconsideration
in
the
light
of
that
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
it
say?
well
it
is
retroactively,
here
a
case
that
isn't
final
yet?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
would
be
--
that
would
may
raise
another
question,
but
not
this
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
the
statute
--
if
there
is
a
statute,
on
its
face.
justice
byron
r.
white
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
isn't
that
equal
protection
for
other
parties
to
make
sure
that
the
action
isn't
frivolous?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
it
isn't
any
longer,
the
policy
of
the
state
anyway?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
--
that
isn't
the
policy
of
the
state
of
nebraska
anymore,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
like
as
if
they
just
never
had?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
didn't
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
would
you
--
would
you
say
the
same
thing
if
a
plaintiff
in
the
trial
court
he
not
only
really
has
to
pay
his
docket
fee
but
he
has
to
file
a
cost
bond
to
protect
the
defendant?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
you
would
say
the
same
thing
if
the
state
required
him
to
post
a
bond
to
get
into
the
trial
court
to
pay
the
defendant's
attorneys
fees.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
would
say
the
same
even
if
admittedly
the
case
was
not
frivolous?
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly
was
that
a
proper
issue
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
doesn't
need
to
be
retroactive,
this
is
still
a
live
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
then
you'd
be
back?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
could
say
so
in
the
remainder.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
way
did
we
decide
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
the
