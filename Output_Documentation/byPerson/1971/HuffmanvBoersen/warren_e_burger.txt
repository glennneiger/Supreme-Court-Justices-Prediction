chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
first
this
morning
in
number
71-5097,
huffman
against
boersen.
mr.
eisenstatt,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
the
actual
cost
of
printing
a
brief
per
page
out
in
omaha
and
lincoln?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
see,
so
it
could
rule
on
$2.60
a
page
is
reasonably
modern.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but,
what
about
the
$75
statute
that
mr.
justice
blackmun
raised.
how
old
or
new
is
that
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
possible
then
that
this
case
comes
down
to
a
claim
of
abuse
of
discretion
by
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
rather
than
constitutional
issue?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
rules
permit
them
to
do
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
there
would
be
no
problem
if
they
had
been
excer
--
if
they
had
been
asked
to
exercise
their
discretion
to
waive
and
had
granted
the
request,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
there
is
no
printed
brief,
do
they
need
the
cost
bond?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
what
if
a
motion
had
been
made?
suppose
you
had
been
there,
you
would
have
made
such
a
motion
i
am
sure
and
then
assume
for
the
moment
what
we
do
not
know
and
that
is
that
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
would
grant
the
waiver
of
printing
and
you
were
allowed
to
file
type
written
briefs,
would
you
then
need
cost
bond?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
his
emotion
might
will
be
that
both
parties
i
had
assumed
in
my
hypothetical
that
your
emotion
would
be
that
both
parties
be
permitted
to
do
so
first
for
your
client's
problem
and
second
you
relieve
him
of
the
need
to
file
the
bond?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
he
could
not
actually
cost
unless
there
was
a
printing
as
distinguished
from
a
type
writing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
it
not
possible
to
construe
that,
not
for
us,
but
for
the
nebraska
supreme
court
to
construe
its
own
statute
as
meaning
that
the
waiver
of
printing
would
permit
a
waiver
of
the
filing
of
the
$75
by
bond
or
cash?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
statute
would
require
them
to
do
a
useless
thing
and
you
think
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
would
probably
construe
it
that
way
as
nearly
as
you
can
judge
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
he
did
pay
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
out
of
the
114
that
you
said
he
had
in
his
pocket?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
eisenstatt.
mr.
dowding.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
distinguish
annulment
from
the
divorce
in
terms
of
the
basic
approach
of
the
boddie
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
state
has
exclusive
control
of
each?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
distinguish
the
initiation
of
the
suit
in
boddie
from
the
right
to
an
appeal?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
agree
that
nebraska's
supreme
court
could
not
waive
the
filing
of
the
$75,
if
they
waive
the
printing
of
the
brief?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
disagree
with
your
friend?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
dowding,
do
you
think
it
would
be
an
appropriate
solution
of
this
case
if
the
court
were
to
decide
to
remand
it
to
the
nebraska
courts
and
let
them
reconsider
the
whole
problem
in
light
of
the
new
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
there
any
dispute
on
the
facts
at
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
that
a
rather
unusual
procedural
device
to
determine
paternity
suit,
paternity
issue
in
annulment
suit?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
established
nebraska
law
then.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
dowding.
mr.
eisenstatt,
your
time
was
consumed
but
if
there
is
any
important
factor
you
wish
to
make,
we
will
give
you
a
minute
or
two.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
agree
with
mr.
dowding
that
a
remand
to
the
nebraska
courts
would
be
an
appropriate
solution
to
this
problem?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
that
you
--
when
you
say
give
them
a
nudge
you
mean
by
that
to
make
it
clear
that
we
expect
nebraska
to
solve
this
problem?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
mr.
eisenstatt
you
appeared
here
by
our
request
and
by
appointment
of
the
court
and
after
the
court
i
want
to
thank
you
for
your
assistance
not
only
to
your
client,
but
to
our
court.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
thank
you
mr.
dowding.
the
case
is
