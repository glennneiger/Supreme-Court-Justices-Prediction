justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
couldn't
they
allow
both
sides
to
proceed
on
typewritten
papers
under
that
rule?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
evidence
you
are
arguing
with
that,
if
they
had
done
that
you
wouldn't
have
the
argument,
would
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
that's
my
whole
point.
if
they
allowed
for
both
sides
to
proceed
on
typewritten
papers,
the
problem
wouldn't
arise
because
they
wouldn't
dismiss
it
then,
would
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
thought
the
rules
said
under
extreme
circumstances
or
something
they
would?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
my
whole
point
is
that
the
court
had
a
choice
it
seems
to
me
of
exercising
its
discretion
under
its
own
rules,
not
to
print,
and
if
they
exercised
that
discretion,
there
would
be
no
need
for
the
security
bond?
justice
thurgood
marshall
has
nebraska
ever
decide
in
a
real
close
case
that
side
bears
its
own
costs?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
happens
to
the
$75
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
state
keeps
it,
i
get
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
is
a
right
under
the
law
of
nebraska,
it's
an
absolute
right,
it's
not
a
discretion
as
a
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
specified
in
the
constitution?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
constitution
says
that
you
have
an
absolute
right
to
appeal
in
a
civil
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
how
do
you
distinguish?
justice
thurgood
marshall
just
by
saying
federal
due
process
law
doesn't
help
me,
how
do
you
say
that
that's
not
a
part
of
the
procedure?
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
that
just
integral
part
of
proceeding
as
original
trial
where
it's
a
matter
of
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
you
say
is
nebraska
says
you
have
an
absolute
right
to
appeal
in
any
civil
case,
if
you
have
$75?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
squares
with
the
federal
constitution?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
ought
to
be
correct
to
recoup
part
of
the
cost?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
know
of
any
bonding
company
in
nebraska
that
give
a
bond
to
a
prisoner
in
the
state
penitentiary?
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
the
case
came
in
the
equity
court
or
some
court
of
nebraska
and
it
seized
all
of
the
money
that
man
had,
every
dollar
he
had
in
the
bank,
his
house,
his
clothes,
his
car
and
everything
and
he
wanted
to
appeal?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
my
case
is
that
if
we
agree
that
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution,
the
court
gave
all
of
this
to
the
plaintiff
in
the
case
and
left
the
defendant
broke.
the
defendant
has
no
regrets
at
all
if
he
broke?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
also
squares
up
for
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
posted
a
cost
bond,
they
just
say
a
$75
bond?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
the
case
involved
14
constitutional
points
and
$16
million
and
the
brief
cost
$4,000
and
75
bucks.
it
is
a
very
simple
point
and
it
required
6
pages
of
brief
in,
$75.
