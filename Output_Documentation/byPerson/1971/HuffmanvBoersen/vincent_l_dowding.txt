mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
two
points
that
were
raised
in
the
questioning.
first
of
all,
the
statute
involved
as
i
read
it
does
permit
discretion.
page
5
of
respondent's
brief
quotes
this
statute
and
it
says
that
the
appeal
maybe
dismissed
on
motion
and
notice
in
the
supreme
court
that
no
bond
has
been
given
and
certified
in
the
transcript
or
within
such
additional
time
as
maybe
fixed
by
the
supreme
court
for
good
cause
shown.
so
that
even
the
failure
to
file
this
bond
or
undertaking
and
it
can
be
cash,
would
not
necessarily
be
an
automatic
dismissal.
so
there
is
discretion
here,
but
i
am
assuming
as
is
mr.
eisenstatt
that
they
did
dismiss
this
simply
because
the
money
was
not
posted.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
i
respect
his
decision
on
that,
but
you
can't
tell
from
the
record
why
they
dismissed
it
here,
but
i
think
we
all
are
assuming
it
was
because
he
didn't
come
up
with
the
$75.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
a
question
mr.
justice
douglas
raised
with
reference
to
whether
or
not
the
boddie
case
was
raised
in
the
nebraska
supreme
court.
my
colleague
mr.
belcher
argued
that
motion
for
dismissal
in
the
nebraska
supreme
court,
and
i
was
informed
and
it
was
our
point
that
the
boddie
case
is
distinguishable
herein
because
the
purpose
of
this
bond
statute
and
urged
to
the
benefit
of
a
private
litigant
and
not
to
the
state.
now
there
was
no
written
opinion
issued
by
the
nebraska
supreme
court
when
they
dismissed.
i
don't
know
but
that
basically
was
the
only
argument
that
was
made
because
mr.
huffman
did
raise
that
case
very
well
in
his
objections
to
our
motion
to
dismiss.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
no,
i
really
don't
whether
they
went
off
on
that
ground
or
not.
i
think
as
mr.
eisenstatt
said
it's
--
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
no.
no,
there
isn't
your
honor.
it
is
our
basic
contention
that
the
statute
which
barred
held
huffman
from
an
appellate
hearing
is
constitutional
for
the
basic
reason
that
it
gives
the
respondent
herein
faye
boersen
financial
protection
on
appeal
and
is
therefore
not
in
violation
of
the
due
process
clause
and
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
no
it
would
cover
its
past
and
--
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
well
if
it
were
remanded
for
reconsideration,
i
would
file
a
motion
to
proceed
pursuant
to
that
statute
and
then
the
question
would
be
whether
or
not
they
would
apply
a
retroactive;y?
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
but
the
problem
is
your
honor
is
that
new
statute
says
that
before
you
can
proceed
in
forma
pauperis
on
appeal,
the
trial
court
must
say
that
the
appeal
is
taken
a
good
faith,
so
they
may
not
apply
it
to
this
specific
case.
but
they
do
have
--
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
yes,
they
could
it
and
we'd
certainly
ask
them
--
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
covers
it.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
it
covers
it
your
honor.
it
says
that
--
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
yes
and
it's
in
affect
now,
passed
--
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
yeah
it's
attached
as
an
appendix
to
my
brief.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
i
don't
know
your
honor
whether
it
was
or
not.
i
wouldn't
be
surprised.
but
it
is
now
in
effect
and
we
would
make
every
attempt
to
proceed
pursuant
to
that
statute
in
order
to
save
the
expenses,
because
my
client
is
also
a
a
pauper.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
yes
they
certainly
could.
with
reference
to
the
due
process
clause
and
its
application
here
we
attempt
to
distinguish
the
boddie
case
and
say
that
it
does
not
stretch
to
reach
this
case
at
bar.
we
say
this
for
two
basic
reasons
and
here
i
am
just
attempting
to
address
myself
to
the
due
process
clause
only.
in
the
boddie
case,
the
court
was
very
careful,
too
limit
it
to
its
facts
and
it
was
careful
to
state
that
it
was
not
a
holding
that
in
some
cases
access
to
courts
cannot
be
denied.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
no,
i
do
not.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
i
do
not
distinguish
it
to
--
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
yes,
that's
right
your
honor.
it's
our
theory
that
the
right
to
appeal
is
not
a
fundamental
right
as
defined
in
the
boddie
case,
under
the
due
process
clause
because
as
i
understand
the
law,
the
due
process
clause
does
not
require
a
state
to
afford
an
appeal
and
therefore
we
argued
from
that
that
the
right
to
appeal
is
not
a
fundamental
right
as
defined
by
boddie.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
no
it
isn't,
but
under
the
nebraska
law,
the
right
to
put
some
requirements
on
it
is
also
specified
and
we
would
further
state
that
the
due
process
is
--
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
no
that's
case
law.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
that's
right
your
honor,
it
does.
the
only
way
we
can
distinguish
that
is
saying
that
we're
talking
about
the
federal
fundamental
right
under
the
due
process
clause,
that's
the
only
way
i
can
distinguish
that
i
feel.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
what?
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
i
am
sorry
your
honor,
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
i
will
concede
that,
except
that
under
the
case
law
at
the
time
this
particular
statutory
requirement
had
been
held
to
be
valid.
now
--
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
that's
right.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
that
would
make
--
perhaps
that
would
then
make
the
right
to
appeal
in
nebraska
a
fundamental
right
under
boddie,
perhaps
my
distinction
would
not
be
valid.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
that's
what
it
amounts
to
your
honor
in
nebraska,
that's
right.
and
the
reason
--
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
we
feel
that
it
does.
we
feel
that
the
boddie
case
is
distinguishable
basically
because
this
particular
cost
bond
requirement
is
for
the
benefit
of
a
private
civil
litigant
and
does
not
go
into
the
state
coffers.
now
in
the
boddie
case,
there
were
two
policies
set
up
by
the
state
of
connecticut,
two
reasons;
one
to
recoup
the
cost
and
two
to
deter
frivolous
litigation.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
yes,
it's
right
your
honor.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
i
agree
that
the
policy
behind
this
statute,
one
of
which
is
--
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
i
feel
that
it
is
still
one
of
the
policy
for
this
particular
statute
to
deter
frivolous
appeals.
i
don't
rest
on
that
distinction.
i
rest
on
the
distinction
that
the
state,
this
is
a
reasonable
purpose
a
constitutional
permissible
purpose
for
state
legislatures
to
protect
civil
litigants
on
appeal,
such
as
in
lindsey
against
normet.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
no,
not
now,
nit
in
forma
pauperis.
so
that
distinguishing
boddie
on
the
policy
grounds
we
feel
that
it's
different
that
the
state
has
power
to
protect
the
private
civil
litigants
on
appeal.
we
feel
that
that
distinction
alone
lightens
the
impact
of
boddie
as
(inaudible)
under
the
due
process
clause.
now
with
reference
to
the
equal
protection
clause,
and
that's
griffin
versus
illinois
and
the
cases
that
have
followed
it,
to
my
knowledge
the
griffin
case
has
not
been
applied
to
a
civil
litigation
on
the
appeal
level.
we
attempt
to
go
to
some
standard
tests
under
the
equal
protection
clause
to
determine
whether
or
not
this
particular
legislation
is
valid.
is
the
purpose
of
the
statute
constitutionally
permissible
and
two,
is
the
statute
rationally
set
up
to
reach
that
means.
now,
in
lindsey
against
normet,
the
court
said
that
at
least
on
its
face
the
standard
bond
requirement
in
there
was
constitutional.
so
we
feel
that
it
is
constitutionally
permissible
for
a
state
to
setup
this
type
of
financial
protection
in
civil
litigation.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
no,
i
agree
that
mr.
huffman
was
indigent
and
when
was
unable
to
make
this
bond
because
of
his
poverty.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
i
think
you
might
have
a
different
case.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
i
think
you
have
got
to
judge
each
case
when
you
have
--
when
you
are
at
the
appeal
level
unlike
boddie,
when
you
are
at
the
appeal
--
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
that's
right,
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
well,
this
is
where
i
am
asking
the
court
to
draw
the
line.
i
am
not
going
to
object
to
appellate
fees
that
are
set
up
and
going
to
the
state
treasury
and
i
think
it's
a
fairly
fine
line,
and
i'll
admit
that
but
i
feel
that
when
you
judge
this
legislation
against
the
equal
protection
clause
that
the
state
does
have
the
right
to
protect
private
litigants.
and
i
think
the
state
can
come
in
and
say
probably
that
the
appellee
also
has
to
post
a
bond
on
appeal.
i
mean
--
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
yeah,
no
it's
a
cost
bond.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
that's
right,
in
some
cases
perhaps
this
statute
is
not
adequate,
perhaps
we
need
more
protection,
but
again
get
back
to
the
point
and
that
is
the
line
that
the
respondent
is
asking
the
court
to
establish
at
this
point.
when
a
state
establishes,
reasonable,
financial
requirements
to
protect
private
litigants
in
civil
cases,
then
it
is
constitutional.
that's
the
line
we
ask
you
to
draw,
and
i
am
willing
to
concede
the
$20
docket
fee
because
i
don't
think
the
state's
policy
--
i
think
in
boddie
the
court
pointed
out,
that
the
state's
policy
in
recouping
part
of
the
cost
does
not
outlay
this
right
to
access.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
yes
he
did,
and
he
also
paid
for
the
printed
brief.
now,
i
don't
know
if
he
were
to
come
in
and
move
to,
ask
for
a
type
written
brief,
whether
it
would
or
not
have
been
granted,
but
if
he
could
have
got
a
type
written
brief
then
he
would
have
had
enough
money
to
make
the
bond
and
that's
the
problem,
but
he
just
came
down
to
this
last
point
and
couldn't
come
up
with
the
money.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
i
think
they
could
waive
them
both.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
yeah,
well
under
on
the
face
of
the
statute
they
are
both
discretionary.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
they
never
have
--
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
i
differ
to
mr.
eisenstatt.
he
says
it,
i
believe
it
on
this
point,
he
has
had
more
experience
than
i
have.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
as
cohen
versus
beneficial
industrial
loan
company
your
honor
and
the
question
is
would
that
case
be
decided
different
today
if
that
plaintiff
were
broken
that
case.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
well,
this
is
right
if
the
court
of
course
follows
this
line
of
marital
relations
being
the
crucial
line
here
of
course
then
they
wouldn't
--
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
that's
basically
where
we
are
at
on
this
huffman
versus
boersen.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
i
would,
i
think
that
the
state,
again
if
they
are
protecting
a
private
civil
litigants
and
it's
got
some
reasonable
basis
in
fact
to
the
purpose
they
are
trying
to
accomplish.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
yes
i
would.
here's
what
would
happen
in
the
lindsey
versus
normet.
let's
suppose
that
all
he
had
was
the
standard
bond
requirement
there
and
the
tenant
was
absolutely
broke
and
had
a
meritorious
appeal,
then
you
would
have
basically
the
same
question
you
got
here
except
that
it's
outside
the
scope
of
domestic
relations.
and
it
would
be
my
contention
in
that
case
that,
that
standard
bond
requirement
would
be
valid
even
though
it
denies
access
because
it's
set
up
as
a
valid
state
purpose
to
protect
the
private
litigant.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
i
do,
i
certainly
could
not
object
because
the
purpose
behind
this
appeal
statute
was
to
give
my
client
financial
protection.
if
i
were
given
permission
to
file
a
type
written
brief
without
coming
up
with
the
cost,
i
could
not
complain.
mr.
huffman
would
then
have
a
hearing
and
my
client
would
have
the
same
protections
she
had
under
the
statute
and
that's
the
alternative
relief
that
i
ask.
i
do
feel
however
that
if
the
court
reverses
and
holds
this
statute
unconstitutional
that
you
have
thereby
probably
unless
you
stick
to
domestic
relation
situations
granted
an
indigent
a
free
pass
on
basically
all
litigation,
because
it's
a
lot
tougher
i
feel
--
it's
easier
to
say
that
the
state
can
afford
to
absorb
the
loss
and
that's
not
a
valid
purpose
to
reimburse
the
state
treasury.
but
i
think
it's
a
lot
harder
to
say
when
you
have
got
two
individuals
and
they
are
protecting
one
litigation
that
that's
unconstitutional.
i
feel
that
once
you
say
that,
that's
it's
unconstitutional
in
this
case
that
really
i
think
about
all
financial
requirements
are
out
as
far
as
an
indigent
is
concern
unless
you
stick
again
to
the
domestic
relations
area.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
i
feel
that's
right,
against
state
policy
once,
the
litigant
is
a
winner
perhaps
they
are
entitled
not
to
behold
into
appeals
court
without
some
protection.
and
that's
the
basis
behind
it
which
i
feel
is
a
valid
state
purpose.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
yes
and
mr.
eisenstatt
furnished
that
for
the
record.
there
is
a
letter
from
the
warden
in
there
saying
that
all
they
require
is
an
order
from
the
court,
directing
that
he'd
be
present
and
they
will
deliver
him.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
no,
your
honor.
the
court
just
overruled
that
there
was
no
argument
on
it
or
anything
and
i
felt
that
at
that
point
that
all
(inaudible)
was
after
wasn't
annulment
and
i
felt
that
the
law
was
clear.
she
was
married
to
mr.
boersen,
once
she
married
mr.
huffman
and
the
record
in
this
case
maybe
two
pages.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
not
on
the
marriage
issue
and
annulment
issue.
there
is
a
dispute
on
whether
or
not
mr.
huffman
is
foreclosed
from
determining
that
he
is
the
father
of
faye's
child.
he
set
that
up.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
well,
i
would
say
it
probably
was
under
nebraska
pleading
because
huffman
set
it
up
in
a
cross
petition.
i
personally
do
not
feel
it
was
validly
determined
and
i
am
willing
to
stipulate
at
any
later
litigation
that
mr.
huffman
can
come
in
and
determine
this.
i
didn't
intend
to
have
that
issue
determined,
let's
put
it
that
way.
he
filed
a
lot
of
pleadings
and
they
weren't
under
any
description
or
name
allowed
by
nebraska
law
and
he
did
raise
the
paternity
issue
in
there
and
it
was
rejected.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
yes,
it
is
your
honor,
but
our
nebraska
court
has
held
that
either
party
can
raise
that
issue
in
an
annulment,
if
it
has
alleged
that
there
are
issue
at
the
marriage
and
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
that
issue
is
not
been
foreclosed.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
i
believe
it
is
your
honor
and
mr.
eisenstatt
cites
a
case
in
his
reply
brief
which
indicates
as
such.
in
closing
then,
we
contend
that
the
statute
which
brought
harold
huffman
from
access
to
the
appeals
court
is
constitutional.
if
the
court
finds
that
it
is
not,
we
ask
for
alternative
relief
to
to
afford
us
the
same
financial
protection.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
yes,
it's
attached
to
our
brief
as
in
appendix.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
well,
this
is
right
your
honor.
we
probably
have
to
go
back
in
and
ask
him
to
apply
it
and
if
both
parties
agreed,
they
might.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
well,
we
might
have
to
go
back
and
ask
the
trial
court
to
certify
that
the
appeal
was
taken
in
good
faith
before
the
appeal
rules
apply
because
that's
what
the
statute
says.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
i
think
that
the
nebraska
supreme
court
would
apply
this.
mr.
eisenstatt
went
in
and
said
that
we
both
want
relief
under
the
statute.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
yes.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
well,
i
don't
--
i
feel
the
appeal
is
frivolous
on
the
annulment
issue.
now,
if
paternity
was
decided
invalidly
against
i
think
that
the
appeal
has
merit.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
yes,
i
am
willing
just
to
agree
that
mr.
huffman
did
not
have
his
fay
in
the
court
on
the
paternity
issue.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
yes,
so
stipulate.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
yes,
it
has
been
decided.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
yes
because
the
nebraska
law
was
clear
on
that
point
that
if
the
party
is
married
when
they
enter
into
another
marriage
contract,
then
the
marriage
is
void.
but,
there
is
a
nevada
statute
which
i
didn't
offer
in
the
evidence
and
so
it
is
outside
the
record,
but
it
says
that
if
parties
are
married
when
they
enter
into
a
marriage
in
nevada,
it's
no
null
and
void
even
without
an
annulment
action.
i
feel
that
faye
boersen
is
entitled
to
an
annulment,
no
question
about
that.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
yes.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
i
feel
it
does.
i
am
willing
to
say
that
the
paternity
issue
was
not
decided
against
harold
huffman.
the
only
annulment
issue,
i
feel
that's
the
only
issue
validly
decided
and
his
appeal
in
my
opinion
is
frivolous.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
yes
it
is.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
well
that
gets
into
the
pleading
laws.
i
am
willing
to
say
the
man
didn't
have
a
fair
hearing
on
that
paternity
and
ought
to
be
able
to
litigate
it.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
yes
it
is.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
alright
your
honor,
i
will
even
concede
that
if
in
fact
the
paternity
issue
was
decided
--
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
--
but
i
am
again
willing
to
open
up
the
courts
on
remand
or
anything
for
huffman
to
decide
this
issue.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
two
points
that
were
raised
in
the
questioning.
first
of
all,
the
statute
involved
as
i
read
it
does
permit
discretion.
page
5
of
respondent's
brief
quotes
this
statute
and
it
says
that
the
appeal
maybe
dismissed
on
motion
and
notice
in
the
supreme
court
that
no
bond
has
been
given
and
certified
in
the
transcript
or
within
such
additional
time
as
maybe
fixed
by
the
supreme
court
for
good
cause
shown.
so
that
even
the
failure
to
file
this
bond
or
undertaking
and
it
can
be
cash,
would
not
necessarily
be
an
automatic
dismissal.
so
there
is
discretion
here,
but
i
am
assuming
as
is
mr.
eisenstatt
that
they
did
dismiss
this
simply
because
the
money
was
not
posted.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
i
respect
his
decision
on
that,
but
you
can't
tell
from
the
record
why
they
dismissed
it
here,
but
i
think
we
all
are
assuming
it
was
because
he
didn't
come
up
with
the
$75.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
a
question
mr.
justice
douglas
raised
with
reference
to
whether
or
not
the
boddie
case
was
raised
in
the
nebraska
supreme
court.
my
colleague
mr.
belcher
argued
that
motion
for
dismissal
in
the
nebraska
supreme
court,
and
i
was
informed
and
it
was
our
point
that
the
boddie
case
is
distinguishable
herein
because
the
purpose
of
this
bond
statute
and
urged
to
the
benefit
of
a
private
litigant
and
not
to
the
state.
now
there
was
no
written
opinion
issued
by
the
nebraska
supreme
court
when
they
dismissed.
i
don't
know
but
that
basically
was
the
only
argument
that
was
made
because
mr.
huffman
did
raise
that
case
very
well
in
his
objections
to
our
motion
to
dismiss.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
no,
i
really
don't
whether
they
went
off
on
that
ground
or
not.
i
think
as
mr.
eisenstatt
said
it's
--
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
no.
no,
there
isn't
your
honor.
it
is
our
basic
contention
that
the
statute
which
barred
held
huffman
from
an
appellate
hearing
is
constitutional
for
the
basic
reason
that
it
gives
the
respondent
herein
faye
boersen
financial
protection
on
appeal
and
is
therefore
not
in
violation
of
the
due
process
clause
and
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
no
it
would
cover
its
past
and
--
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
well
if
it
were
remanded
for
reconsideration,
i
would
file
a
motion
to
proceed
pursuant
to
that
statute
and
then
the
question
would
be
whether
or
not
they
would
apply
a
retroactive;y?
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
but
the
problem
is
your
honor
is
that
new
statute
says
that
before
you
can
proceed
in
forma
pauperis
on
appeal,
the
trial
court
must
say
that
the
appeal
is
taken
a
good
faith,
so
they
may
not
apply
it
to
this
specific
case.
but
they
do
have
--
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
yes,
they
could
it
and
we'd
certainly
ask
them
--
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
covers
it.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
it
covers
it
your
honor.
it
says
that
--
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
yes
and
it's
in
affect
now,
passed
--
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
yeah
it's
attached
as
an
appendix
to
my
brief.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
i
don't
know
your
honor
whether
it
was
or
not.
i
wouldn't
be
surprised.
but
it
is
now
in
effect
and
we
would
make
every
attempt
to
proceed
pursuant
to
that
statute
in
order
to
save
the
expenses,
because
my
client
is
also
a
a
pauper.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
yes
they
certainly
could.
with
reference
to
the
due
process
clause
and
its
application
here
we
attempt
to
distinguish
the
boddie
case
and
say
that
it
does
not
stretch
to
reach
this
case
at
bar.
we
say
this
for
two
basic
reasons
and
here
i
am
just
attempting
to
address
myself
to
the
due
process
clause
only.
in
the
boddie
case,
the
court
was
very
careful,
too
limit
it
to
its
facts
and
it
was
careful
to
state
that
it
was
not
a
holding
that
in
some
cases
access
to
courts
cannot
be
denied.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
no,
i
do
not.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
i
do
not
distinguish
it
to
--
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
yes,
that's
right
your
honor.
it's
our
theory
that
the
right
to
appeal
is
not
a
fundamental
right
as
defined
in
the
boddie
case,
under
the
due
process
clause
because
as
i
understand
the
law,
the
due
process
clause
does
not
require
a
state
to
afford
an
appeal
and
therefore
we
argued
from
that
that
the
right
to
appeal
is
not
a
fundamental
right
as
defined
by
boddie.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
no
it
isn't,
but
under
the
nebraska
law,
the
right
to
put
some
requirements
on
it
is
also
specified
and
we
would
further
state
that
the
due
process
is
--
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
no
that's
case
law.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
that's
right
your
honor,
it
does.
the
only
way
we
can
distinguish
that
is
saying
that
we're
talking
about
the
federal
fundamental
right
under
the
due
process
clause,
that's
the
only
way
i
can
distinguish
that
i
feel.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
what?
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
i
am
sorry
your
honor,
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
i
will
concede
that,
except
that
under
the
case
law
at
the
time
this
particular
statutory
requirement
had
been
held
to
be
valid.
now
--
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
that's
right.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
that
would
make
--
perhaps
that
would
then
make
the
right
to
appeal
in
nebraska
a
fundamental
right
under
boddie,
perhaps
my
distinction
would
not
be
valid.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
that's
what
it
amounts
to
your
honor
in
nebraska,
that's
right.
and
the
reason
--
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
we
feel
that
it
does.
we
feel
that
the
boddie
case
is
distinguishable
basically
because
this
particular
cost
bond
requirement
is
for
the
benefit
of
a
private
civil
litigant
and
does
not
go
into
the
state
coffers.
now
in
the
boddie
case,
there
were
two
policies
set
up
by
the
state
of
connecticut,
two
reasons;
one
to
recoup
the
cost
and
two
to
deter
frivolous
litigation.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
yes,
it's
right
your
honor.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
i
agree
that
the
policy
behind
this
statute,
one
of
which
is
--
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
i
feel
that
it
is
still
one
of
the
policy
for
this
particular
statute
to
deter
frivolous
appeals.
i
don't
rest
on
that
distinction.
i
rest
on
the
distinction
that
the
state,
this
is
a
reasonable
purpose
a
constitutional
permissible
purpose
for
state
legislatures
to
protect
civil
litigants
on
appeal,
such
as
in
lindsey
against
normet.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
no,
not
now,
nit
in
forma
pauperis.
so
that
distinguishing
boddie
on
the
policy
grounds
we
feel
that
it's
different
that
the
state
has
power
to
protect
the
private
civil
litigants
on
appeal.
we
feel
that
that
distinction
alone
lightens
the
impact
of
boddie
as
(inaudible)
under
the
due
process
clause.
now
with
reference
to
the
equal
protection
clause,
and
that's
griffin
versus
illinois
and
the
cases
that
have
followed
it,
to
my
knowledge
the
griffin
case
has
not
been
applied
to
a
civil
litigation
on
the
appeal
level.
we
attempt
to
go
to
some
standard
tests
under
the
equal
protection
clause
to
determine
whether
or
not
this
particular
legislation
is
valid.
is
the
purpose
of
the
statute
constitutionally
permissible
and
two,
is
the
statute
rationally
set
up
to
reach
that
means.
now,
in
lindsey
against
normet,
the
court
said
that
at
least
on
its
face
the
standard
bond
requirement
in
there
was
constitutional.
so
we
feel
that
it
is
constitutionally
permissible
for
a
state
to
setup
this
type
of
financial
protection
in
civil
litigation.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
no,
i
agree
that
mr.
huffman
was
indigent
and
when
was
unable
to
make
this
bond
because
of
his
poverty.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
i
think
you
might
have
a
different
case.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
i
think
you
have
got
to
judge
each
case
when
you
have
--
when
you
are
at
the
appeal
level
unlike
boddie,
when
you
are
at
the
appeal
--
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
that's
right,
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
well,
this
is
where
i
am
asking
the
court
to
draw
the
line.
i
am
not
going
to
object
to
appellate
fees
that
are
set
up
and
going
to
the
state
treasury
and
i
think
it's
a
fairly
fine
line,
and
i'll
admit
that
but
i
feel
that
when
you
judge
this
legislation
against
the
equal
protection
clause
that
the
state
does
have
the
right
to
protect
private
litigants.
and
i
think
the
state
can
come
in
and
say
probably
that
the
appellee
also
has
to
post
a
bond
on
appeal.
i
mean
--
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
yeah,
no
it's
a
cost
bond.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
that's
right,
in
some
cases
perhaps
this
statute
is
not
adequate,
perhaps
we
need
more
protection,
but
again
get
back
to
the
point
and
that
is
the
line
that
the
respondent
is
asking
the
court
to
establish
at
this
point.
when
a
state
establishes,
reasonable,
financial
requirements
to
protect
private
litigants
in
civil
cases,
then
it
is
constitutional.
that's
the
line
we
ask
you
to
draw,
and
i
am
willing
to
concede
the
$20
docket
fee
because
i
don't
think
the
state's
policy
--
i
think
in
boddie
the
court
pointed
out,
that
the
state's
policy
in
recouping
part
of
the
cost
does
not
outlay
this
right
to
access.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
yes
he
did,
and
he
also
paid
for
the
printed
brief.
now,
i
don't
know
if
he
were
to
come
in
and
move
to,
ask
for
a
type
written
brief,
whether
it
would
or
not
have
been
granted,
but
if
he
could
have
got
a
type
written
brief
then
he
would
have
had
enough
money
to
make
the
bond
and
that's
the
problem,
but
he
just
came
down
to
this
last
point
and
couldn't
come
up
with
the
money.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
i
think
they
could
waive
them
both.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
yeah,
well
under
on
the
face
of
the
statute
they
are
both
discretionary.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
they
never
have
--
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
i
differ
to
mr.
eisenstatt.
he
says
it,
i
believe
it
on
this
point,
he
has
had
more
experience
than
i
have.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
as
cohen
versus
beneficial
industrial
loan
company
your
honor
and
the
question
is
would
that
case
be
decided
different
today
if
that
plaintiff
were
broken
that
case.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
well,
this
is
right
if
the
court
of
course
follows
this
line
of
marital
relations
being
the
crucial
line
here
of
course
then
they
wouldn't
--
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
that's
basically
where
we
are
at
on
this
huffman
versus
boersen.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
i
would,
i
think
that
the
state,
again
if
they
are
protecting
a
private
civil
litigants
and
it's
got
some
reasonable
basis
in
fact
to
the
purpose
they
are
trying
to
accomplish.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
yes
i
would.
here's
what
would
happen
in
the
lindsey
versus
normet.
let's
suppose
that
all
he
had
was
the
standard
bond
requirement
there
and
the
tenant
was
absolutely
broke
and
had
a
meritorious
appeal,
then
you
would
have
basically
the
same
question
you
got
here
except
that
it's
outside
the
scope
of
domestic
relations.
and
it
would
be
my
contention
in
that
case
that,
that
standard
bond
requirement
would
be
valid
even
though
it
denies
access
because
it's
set
up
as
a
valid
state
purpose
to
protect
the
private
litigant.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
i
do,
i
certainly
could
not
object
because
the
purpose
behind
this
appeal
statute
was
to
give
my
client
financial
protection.
if
i
were
given
permission
to
file
a
type
written
brief
without
coming
up
with
the
cost,
i
could
not
complain.
mr.
huffman
would
then
have
a
hearing
and
my
client
would
have
the
same
protections
she
had
under
the
statute
and
that's
the
alternative
relief
that
i
ask.
i
do
feel
however
that
if
the
court
reverses
and
holds
this
statute
unconstitutional
that
you
have
thereby
probably
unless
you
stick
to
domestic
relation
situations
granted
an
indigent
a
free
pass
on
basically
all
litigation,
because
it's
a
lot
tougher
i
feel
--
it's
easier
to
say
that
the
state
can
afford
to
absorb
the
loss
and
that's
not
a
valid
purpose
to
reimburse
the
state
treasury.
but
i
think
it's
a
lot
harder
to
say
when
you
have
got
two
individuals
and
they
are
protecting
one
litigation
that
that's
unconstitutional.
i
feel
that
once
you
say
that,
that's
it's
unconstitutional
in
this
case
that
really
i
think
about
all
financial
requirements
are
out
as
far
as
an
indigent
is
concern
unless
you
stick
again
to
the
domestic
relations
area.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
i
feel
that's
right,
against
state
policy
once,
the
litigant
is
a
winner
perhaps
they
are
entitled
not
to
behold
into
appeals
court
without
some
protection.
and
that's
the
basis
behind
it
which
i
feel
is
a
valid
state
purpose.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
yes
and
mr.
eisenstatt
furnished
that
for
the
record.
there
is
a
letter
from
the
warden
in
there
saying
that
all
they
require
is
an
order
from
the
court,
directing
that
he'd
be
present
and
they
will
deliver
him.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
no,
your
honor.
the
court
just
overruled
that
there
was
no
argument
on
it
or
anything
and
i
felt
that
at
that
point
that
all
(inaudible)
was
after
wasn't
annulment
and
i
felt
that
the
law
was
clear.
she
was
married
to
mr.
boersen,
once
she
married
mr.
huffman
and
the
record
in
this
case
maybe
two
pages.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
not
on
the
marriage
issue
and
annulment
issue.
there
is
a
dispute
on
whether
or
not
mr.
huffman
is
foreclosed
from
determining
that
he
is
the
father
of
faye's
child.
he
set
that
up.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
well,
i
would
say
it
probably
was
under
nebraska
pleading
because
huffman
set
it
up
in
a
cross
petition.
i
personally
do
not
feel
it
was
validly
determined
and
i
am
willing
to
stipulate
at
any
later
litigation
that
mr.
huffman
can
come
in
and
determine
this.
i
didn't
intend
to
have
that
issue
determined,
let's
put
it
that
way.
he
filed
a
lot
of
pleadings
and
they
weren't
under
any
description
or
name
allowed
by
nebraska
law
and
he
did
raise
the
paternity
issue
in
there
and
it
was
rejected.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
yes,
it
is
your
honor,
but
our
nebraska
court
has
held
that
either
party
can
raise
that
issue
in
an
annulment,
if
it
has
alleged
that
there
are
issue
at
the
marriage
and
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
that
issue
is
not
been
foreclosed.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
i
believe
it
is
your
honor
and
mr.
eisenstatt
cites
a
case
in
his
reply
brief
which
indicates
as
such.
in
closing
then,
we
contend
that
the
statute
which
brought
harold
huffman
from
access
to
the
appeals
court
is
constitutional.
if
the
court
finds
that
it
is
not,
we
ask
for
alternative
relief
to
to
afford
us
the
same
financial
protection.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
yes,
it's
attached
to
our
brief
as
in
appendix.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
well,
this
is
right
your
honor.
we
probably
have
to
go
back
in
and
ask
him
to
apply
it
and
if
both
parties
agreed,
they
might.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
well,
we
might
have
to
go
back
and
ask
the
trial
court
to
certify
that
the
appeal
was
taken
in
good
faith
before
the
appeal
rules
apply
because
that's
what
the
statute
says.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
i
think
that
the
nebraska
supreme
court
would
apply
this.
mr.
eisenstatt
went
in
and
said
that
we
both
want
relief
under
the
statute.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
yes.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
well,
i
don't
--
i
feel
the
appeal
is
frivolous
on
the
annulment
issue.
now,
if
paternity
was
decided
invalidly
against
i
think
that
the
appeal
has
merit.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
yes,
i
am
willing
just
to
agree
that
mr.
huffman
did
not
have
his
fay
in
the
court
on
the
paternity
issue.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
yes,
so
stipulate.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
yes,
it
has
been
decided.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
yes
because
the
nebraska
law
was
clear
on
that
point
that
if
the
party
is
married
when
they
enter
into
another
marriage
contract,
then
the
marriage
is
void.
but,
there
is
a
nevada
statute
which
i
didn't
offer
in
the
evidence
and
so
it
is
outside
the
record,
but
it
says
that
if
parties
are
married
when
they
enter
into
a
marriage
in
nevada,
it's
no
null
and
void
even
without
an
annulment
action.
i
feel
that
faye
boersen
is
entitled
to
an
annulment,
no
question
about
that.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
yes.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
i
feel
it
does.
i
am
willing
to
say
that
the
paternity
issue
was
not
decided
against
harold
huffman.
the
only
annulment
issue,
i
feel
that's
the
only
issue
validly
decided
and
his
appeal
in
my
opinion
is
frivolous.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
yes
it
is.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
well
that
gets
into
the
pleading
laws.
i
am
willing
to
say
the
man
didn't
have
a
fair
hearing
on
that
paternity
and
ought
to
be
able
to
litigate
it.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
yes
it
is.
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
alright
your
honor,
i
will
even
concede
that
if
in
fact
the
paternity
issue
was
decided
--
mr.
vincent
l.
dowding
--
but
i
am
again
willing
to
open
up
the
courts
on
remand
or
anything
for
huffman
to
decide
this
issue.
