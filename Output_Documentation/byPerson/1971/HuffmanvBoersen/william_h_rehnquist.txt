could
the
appellee
tax
the
cause
of
his
brief
in
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
purpose
of
the
cause
found
in
nearest
to
the
benefit
and
of
the
other
party,
the
appellee
in
this
case?
justice

rehnquist
mr.
eisenstatt,
do
the
nebraska
decisions
indicate
that
dismissal
is
automatic
upon
failure
to
file
the
$75
bond
or
does
the
supreme
court
on
occasion
exercise
some
sort
of
discretion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
so
for
as
nebraska
law
is
concerned,
the
failure
to
file
a
bond
would
be
an
automatic
ground
for
dismissal?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
eisenstatt,
do
you
see
any
legal
significance
in
what
at
least
appears
to
be
a
factual
distinction
here
that
this
bond
is
not
something
that
goes
to
pay
for
something
that
the
appellant
has
but
is
to
reimburse
the
other
party
for
an
expense
that
they
have
incurred?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
that
a
fairly
common
practice
among
all
the
states
though
to
say
that
once
that
litigation
has
been
come
to
a
decision
in
the
trial
court
that
then
the
burden
shifts
and
effects
so
far
as
securing
costs?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
emotion
is
a
kind
of
an
odd
one,
that
we're
talking
about
basically
whether
it
be
the
appellant
more
than
that
the
appeal
be
permitted
proceed
on
a
type
written
brief?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
disagree
with
mr.
eisenstatt's
statement
that
the
nebraska
case
law
indicates
that
dismissal
will
follow
virtually
automatically?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska,
if
this
case
were
remanded
might
in
term
remand
to
the
trial
court
for
appropriate
findings
to
whether
the
appeal
were
taken
in
good
faith?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
suppose
your
case
here
is
somewhat
stronger
because
you've
had
a
hearing
in
the
trial
court
and
it
is
on
appeal,
then
it
would
be
if
you
simply
had
a
cost
bond
requirement
in
the
state
--
i
mean
in
the
trial
court
before
there
would
be
any
determination?
