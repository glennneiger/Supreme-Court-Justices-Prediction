mr.
leo
eisenstatt
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
on
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
nebraska
and
involves
in
its
essence
a
--
several
questions
involving
the
annulment
of
a
marriage,
a
determination
of
paternity
and
the
allowance
or
granting
or
the
violation
thereof
the
right
to
be
present
at
trial.
these
proceedings
now
before
the
court
commenced
by
the
filing
of
a
petition
for
annulment
in
the
district
court
of
hall
county,
nebraska,
grand
island
approximately
in
the
middle
of
the
state.
the
defendant
in
that
case,
petitioner
here
harold
eugene
hoffman
was
at
that
time
incarcerated
in
the
state
penitentiary
in
lincoln,
nebraska
approximately
a
110
miles
away.
throughout
the
proceedings,
mr.
huffman
appeared
pro
se
until
the
appointment
of
counsel
by
this
court
in
response
to
his
request
for
a
writ
of
certiorari.
the
essential
facts,
as
we
view
them,
would
be
that
on
march
5,
1969,
these
two
parties,
harold
eugene
hoffman
and
faye
boersen
were
married
in
las
vegas,
nevada.
at
that
time,
the
parties
had
been
living
in
hamilton
county,
adjoining
hall
county
in
a
small
town
known
as
giltner,
nebraska.
at
that
time,
there
was
--
there
had
been
filed
by
faye,
a
petition
for
divorce
from
a
marriage
contracted
according
to
the
record
with
richard
a.
boersen
and
with
respect
to
whom
there
were
two
children
at
that
time
of
the
marriage.
now
the,
and
i
will
get
into
the
facts
in
a
little
more
detail,
the
petitioner's
view
of
the
issues
in
this
case
are
in
two
general
areas,
and
that
is,
was
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
violated
with
respect
to
the
petitioner
by
reason
of
the
dismissal
of
his
appeal
in
that
annulment
case
by
the
nebraska
supreme
court
because
he
failed
to
file
a
$75
cost
security,
bond
or
cash
in
lieu
thereof,
and
secondly,
were
his
rights
to
be
present
at
the
trial
violated
when
he
was
incarcerated
at
the
state
penitentiary
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
the
facts
are
not
in
dispute
and
although
there
are
lengthy
pleadings
on
file,
a
distillation
of
those
facts
in
our
opinion
could
not
make
the
facts
very
complicated.
now,
before
referring
to
these
additional
facts,
i
would
like
to
footnote
nebraska
provisions
dealing
with
the
matter
of
appeal.
since
its
founding,
the
state
of
nebraska
has
had
in
its
bill
of
rights,
a
provision,
guaranteeing
right
of
appeal
in
all
civil
cases.
article
1
section
24,
provides
the
right
to
be
heard
in
all
civil
cases
in
the
court
of
last
resort
by
appeal,
error
or
otherwise
shall
not
be
denied,
and
as
announced
by
a
long
line
of
nebraska
cases,
more
particularly
as
it
applies
to
this
case
and
we've
cited
in
our
brief,
the
case
of
ferber
versus
leise
which
held
that
this
right
of
appeal
exists
irrespective
of
the
merits
or
the
lack
thereof
in
the
court
or
in
the
record.
in
other
words,
they
take
the
position
that
our
supreme
court
should
not
consider
a
case
until
it's
been
properly
presented
and
not
try
to
anticipate
whether
or
not
the
appeal
is
frivolous
or
has
some
substance.
now
the
records
shows
that
faye
had
been
married
to
or
entered
into
a
marriage
ceremony
with
richard
boersen
in
june
of
1964.
and
she
had
filed
an
action
for
divorce,
well,
there
were
two
of
them,
but
the
one
involved
is
in
february
of
1969
and
that
action
boersen
had
filed
a
counter
suit.
then
on
march
5,
as
i
stated,
she
married
the
petitioner
in
las
vegas,
nevada.
and
about
a-month-and-a-half
later,
april
24,
a
divorce
decree
was
entered.
in
october
of
that
year,
1969,
she
gave
birth
to
a
child,
a
child
which
the
petitioner
claims
paternity
and
is
also
one
of
the
issues
involved
in
this
case.
now,
in
november
1970,
faye
filed
the
petition
for
annulment
in
the
hall
county
district
court.
huffman
was
incarcerated
in
the
state
penitentiary
on
november
9.
the
sheriff
of
lancaster
county
pursuant
to
our
local
procedure
served
the
summons.
he
was
allowed
in
to
serve
the
summons
on
the
petitioner
and
service
in
written
was
made
of
that
fact.
in
the
pleadings
that
followed
as
i
said
all
filed
by
huffman
pro
se,
by
the
way
mr.
huffman
is
the
inmate's
legal
assistant
at
the
nebraska
penitentiary.
a
review
of
the
record
in
this
case
would
indicate
some
expertise
and
knowledge
on
his
part
that
might
not
be
possessed
of
an
ordinary
layman.
now,
among
the
pleadings
filed,
he
raised
the
issue
of
denial
of
her
right
to
annulment.
he
raised
the
issue
and
claimed
the
right
to
be
found
--
the
father
of
his
child
born
in
october
1969
and
he
also
demanded
in
several
pleadings
the
right
to
be
present
at
any
trial.
he
also
advised
the
court
that
he
was
without
funds
and
had
no
counsel.
now,
the
record
is
undisputed
that
about
that
time,
mr.
huffman
had
approximately
a
$114
of
resources
and
this
has
been
stipulated
and
admitted.
the
case
as
i
said
was
filed
in
november,
in
march
of
1971
faye's
attorney
ex
parte
asked
the
court
to
set
the
case
for
trial,
which
was
perfectly
in
line
with
local
procedure.
the
case
was
set
for
trial
on
march
26.
huffman
was
given
notice
of
that
trial,
again
by
the
sheriff
of
lancaster
county,
who
served
this
upon
him
on
march,
22.
on
that
same
day,
mr.
huffman
wrote
a
letter
to
the
judge,
which
appears
in
the
appendix
at
page
48,
stating
that
he
had
just
received
this
service
which
was
four
days
prior
to
the
trial,
that
he
had
no
counsel,
and
again,
renewed
his
demand
to
be
present.
now,
in
a
prior
document,
which
he
filed,
called
a
motion
for
appearance,
he
had
advised
the
court
of
the
same
facts
and
further
advised
the
court
that
all
it
took
was
a
simple
order
by
the
court
to
have
the
warden
produce
mr.
huffman
at
his
trial
on
the
annulment
in
grand
island.
on
march
26,
the
trial
took
place
and
a
decree
or
order
of
annulment
was
entered.
huffman's
pleadings
were
all
dismissed,
held
for
naught.
on
april
9,
huffman
filed
his
notice
of
appeal
and
this
is
all
in
accordance
with
nebraska
procedure
and
he
paid
a
$20
docket
fee
which
is
also
required
by
our
statute.
he
also
filed
praecipes
for
the
preparation
of
a
transcript,
preparation
of
a
bill
of
exceptions,
which
were
prepared;
the
transcript
by
the
clerk,
the
bill
of
exceptions
by
the
court
reporter
and
these
all
appear
in
the
appendix.
now
section
25,
1914
of
our
nebraska
statutes
among
other
things
requires
that
the
cost
security
of
$75
be
filed.
now
our
nebraska
statutes
have,
i
think,
as
most
states
do
requirements
which
must
be
followed
in
order
to
lodge
an
appeal
in
the
nebraska
supreme
court.
the
notice
of
appeal
and
the
$20
docket
fee
are
denominated
as
jurisdictional.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
no,
your
honor.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
this
was
all
on
documents.
well,
i
wish
to
withdraw
that.
mr.
dowding
did
appear
at
the
argument
in
the
supreme
court,
but
mr.
huffman
did
not,
he
was
in
the
penitentiary.
i
haven't
got
into
that
point,
but
in
the
supreme
court
the
--
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
no
sir,
it
was
raised
however
by
mr.
huffman
in
his
pleadings.
now
as
i
said,
he
filed
the
praecipes,
he
filed
a
notice
of
appeal
and
the
$20
docket
fee.
statute
requires
within
30
days
of
that
date,
the
cost
security
to
be
filed.
on
may
19,
faye's
attorney
filed
a
motion
in
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
to
dismiss
the
appeal
for
failure
to
file
the
cost
security.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
very
much
in
excess
of
that,
your
honor.
my
own
personal
experience
say,
even
a
small
brief
is
over
$200,
and
most
of
the
time
there
are
$300
and
$400
present
prices.
now
the
supreme
court
has
a
rule
which
provides
for
reimbursement
at
$2.60
of
pay
which
comes
to
$195.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
he
can
--
the
winning
party
in
the
appeal
gets
reimbursement
for
75
pages
x
$2.60,
which
is
taxed
as
cost.
only
the
appellant
however
must
file
a
cost
security.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
that's
right,
because
the
statutory
cost
as
far
as
the
state
are
concerned
in
an
appeal
are
taking
care
of
the
$20
docket
fee.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
in
excess
of
$3,
three
and
a
quarter.
sometimes
--
and
now
up
to
four,
depending
on
which
printer,
at
least
in
omaha.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
very
modern.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
that
statute
has
been
on
our
books
since
the
turn
of
the
century.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
no,
that's
quite
right.
i
would
like
to
respond
to
the
questions
as
they're
raised.
now
to
fill
you
in
--
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
yes.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
there
is
a
provision,
your
honor,
in
the
rules
of
the
nebraska
supreme
court,
which
provide
that
the
rule
9
(a)
of
the
supreme
court
which
is
quoted
on
page
5
of
our
brief
provides
in
part,
all
briefs
shall
be
printed
unless
otherwise
allowed
by
the
court
on
good
cause
shown.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
i
would
agree
with
that
statement
based
upon
the
background
and
experience
of
our
court,
our
nebraska
court
to
date.
the
provision
for
waiver
or
some
kind
of
amendment
that
that
refers
to.
i
have
no
knowledge
of
any
case
where
that
has
been
waived
or
there
has
been
any
change
about
it
or
even
a
provision
for
paying
it
on
the
installment
plan,
for
example,
or
provided
--
well,
they
wouldn't
be
for
payment
on
the
installment,
it
would
be
up
to
the
printer
and
the
petitioner
or
the
appellant.
but
the
waiver
of
that
or
the
right
to
provide
typed
briefs
has
not
to
my
experience
been
permitted
and
in
my
own
knowledge
as
far
as
the
bar
association
is
concerned,
we've
attempted
on
several
occasions
to
get
that
rule
amended
without
success.
that,
of
course,
is
outside
the
record.
when
faye's
attorney
filed
the
motion
to
dismiss
appeal
for
failing
to
supply
the
cost
security
or
huffman
was
given
notice
by
mail
and
he
at
that
time
filed
an
objection,
the
document
entitled
the
objection.
he
filed
a
motion
to
proceed
in
in
forma
pauperis.
he
filed
an
affidavit
and
also
filed
a
motion
to
stay
the
mandate
but
the
court
ruled
against
him
so
that
he
could
lodge
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
in
this
court.
the
appeal
was
dismissed
without
opinion,
just
an
order
entered
in
their
journal.
and
on
june
14,
there
was
a
hearing
at
which
faye's
attorney
was
present
and
i
might
advise
the
court
that
at
the
time
involved
mr.
huffman
had
ordered
a
brief
from
the
gant
publishing
company
in
lincoln,
nebraska
at
a
cost
of
$88.58,
which
had
to
be
paid
in
advance.
so
after
he
paid
the
$20
docket
fee
and
after
he
had
paid
the
printer,
his
$88.58,
he
had
less
than
$5
left
to
his
name
which
is
set
forth
in
his
affidavit.
the
money
that
he
--
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
there
is
no
case
in
the
state
where
a
waiver
has
been
granted.
there
are
one
or
two
decisions
only,
your
honor,
that
have
ruled
on
this
and
other
requirements
and
all
have
been
to
the
effect
that
these
are
reasonable
requirements
and
that
the
appeal
be
dismissed.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
although
it
isn't
classified
as
jurisdictional,
as
the
notice
of
appeal
and
the
$20
docket
fee,
it
has
the
same
effect.
you
are
dismissed
from
your
appeal
if
you
do
not
comply
with
it.
and
there
has
been
at
least
one
case
where
a
dismissal
has
occurred
because
of
this.
there
are
very
few
decisions,
one
or
two
at
the
most.
now
the
rule
involved
in
this
case
and
for
which
petitioner
seeks
redress
at
this
court
stems
mainly
from
the
rule
in
boddie
versus
connecticut,
decided
by
this
court
in
march
of
last
year.
the
court
in
boddie,
this
court
in
boddie
was
careful
to
announce
that
it
was
deciding
the
case
only
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
it
was
a
marital
situation,
allowance
of
an
indigent
to
file
a
divorce
petition,
and
because
the
state
exercised
control
over
it,
the
marital
relationship
in
its
dissolution,
it
held
that
this
case
then
merited
the
application
of
the
rule
that
had
long
been
in
effect
with
respect
to
criminal
cases.
now
on
that
basis
alone,
we
have
a
similarity
here
in
our
huffman
case.
we
have
an
annulment
and
a
matter
of
determination
of
paternity.
the
issue,
of
course,
goes
one
step
further
and
that
is
the
matter
of
appeal
and
it
is
petitioner's
opinion
that
the
rule
of
griffin
versus
illinois,
decided
in
1956,
is
applicable
here
and
also
the
cases
which
have
followed
griffin.
griffin
held
that
an
indigent
in
a
criminal
case
was
entitled
to
have
a
transcript
furnished
by
the
state,
if
he
could
not
afford
it
in
order
to
provide
him
with
an
appeal.
as
the
court
pointed
out,
appeal
is
not
required,
but
if
the
state
allows
appeals
as
a
general
practice
and
in
its
rules
and
procedures,
then
it
cannot
as
a
matter
of
equal
protection
of
the
law
deny
the
same
rights
to
indigents.
and
there
have
been
a
host
of
cases
following
griffin
in
the
criminal
field
and
the
rule
has
been
amplified,
for
example,
in
williams
versus
oklahoma
city
decided
in
1969
by
this
court,
extended
the
griffin
rule
to
a
quasi-criminal
case
which
was
a
violation
of
the
city
ordinance,
90-day
jail
sentence
and
a
small
fine.
it
also
involved
the
issue
of
free
transcript.
and
then
in
december
of
this
year,
in
mayor
versus
chicago,
this
court
extended
the
griffin
rule
to
a
misdemeanor
case
which
involved
a
fine
only.
and
based
upon
boddie,
which
extended
the
right
of
access
to
the
courts
in
a
marital
situation,
we
feel
mandates,
the
application
of
griffin
and
its
progeny
to
this
case.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
yes
i
realize,
this
is
a
distinction,
but
if
in
our
opinion
this
is
a
distinction
without
a
difference.
first
of
all,
it
is
state
action.
secondly,
it
is
a
minimal
protection.
thirdly,
it
makes
no
difference
as
we
see
at
whether
this
--
the
cost
requirement
in
the
handling
of
a
case
is
to
pay
a
fee
which
is
state
action
or
to
pay
a
printer
which
again
is
individual
action
or
to
pay
a
cost
security.
now
in
lindsey
against
normet
which
was
just
recently
decided
by
this
case
the
--
i
think
this
court
has
answered
that
question,
and
we
must
keep
in
mind
in
lindsey,
that
there
were
two
--
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
you
decided
that
the
double
appeal
was
not
valid
and
put
as
a
matter
of
equal
protection
of
the
law
cannot
be
imposed
upon
attainment.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
yes.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
that's
right
but
there
was
--
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
but
there
the
court
was
addressing
itself
protection
of
property
that
is
the
tenant
was
occupying
the
--
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
well,
but
it
did
not
address
itself
--
we're
talking
about
the
initial,
the
payment
or
requirement
of
paying
rent
during
the
pendency
of
the
action.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
but
it
applied
to
a
particular
situation
your
honor,
it
dealt
with
property
that
the
tenant
was
occupying,
it
was
this
case
and
the
matter
of
cost
are
not
opposite,
i
mean
are
not
consistent
or
the
same.
there
you
have
the
protection
or
as
the
rule
stated
protection
of
the
property
as
a
landlord,
or
to
protect
a
judgment
secured,
you
don't
have
that
here.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
well
at
least
--
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
that's
right,
if
it
denies
him
access
to
the
courts
and
this
has
already
been
the
court's
position
in
boddie.
there
was
no
requirement
to
there
so
far
as
protecting
the
other
party
and
here
in
boddie
there
was
a
waiver
of
the
filing
fees
which
the
state
mandated
as
well
as
what
the
sheriff
required.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
not
necessarily,
and
there
is
another
thing
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
point
out
in
that
regard.
in
the
filing
of
the
original
petitions,
state
of
nebraska
does
not
require
a
bond
to
protect
the
defendant,
if
the
plaintiff
loses
and
the
appeal,
only
the
appellant
must
file
this.
there
is
no
cost
security
given
to
the
appellee.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
yes,
it's
very
common
and
it
is
a
--
and
we
do
not
attack
the
essential
validity
of
that,
we
agree
that
this
is
a
valid
exercise
of
state
rights.
but
when
it
prevents
the
indigent
from
coming
into
court
or
getting
a
rights
of
appeal
without
any
regard
to
their
merits
then
it
is
an
invidious
discrimination
which
the
constitution
prescribes.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
they
could
your
honor
and
that
was
suggested
mr.
dowding
in
his
answer
brief.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
well
then
there
wouldn't
be
a
need
for
a
cost
security
either
because
the
only
purpose
of
the
cost
security
provides
in
the
--
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
no
your
honor.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
they
did.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
right,
but
the
court
does
not
permit
the
filing
of
typewritten
briefs
in
the
state
of
nebraska.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
i
know
that
the
rule
says
that
your
honor,
but
i
know
of
no
case
where
the
court
has
ever
done
it.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
that's
right,
the
only
thing
that
the
bond
protects
is
the
brief
printing
cost
of
the
appellee.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
my
client
did
not,
your
honor.
he
asked
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis
in
a
general
way
without
specifically
referring
to
this
provision.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
right,
he
asked
generally
for
the
right
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
i
would
say
no
your
honor,
on
the
basis
of
the
experience
of
the
nebraska
court
did
not
ever
varying
from
its
rule
requiring
printed
briefs.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
they
could.
yes
your
honor,
they
could.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
no,
as
to
the
cost
bond
there
is
no
discretion,
as
to
the
printing
of
the
briefs
there
would
be.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
well
the
statute,
29
--
25-1914
does
not
give
them
that
discretion,
it's
an
evidence.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
no,
your
honor,
you
would
not
need
a
cost
bond,
but
the
statute
does
not
give
that
discretion.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
right.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
your
honor,
the
only
way
that
i
see
that
the
nebraska
supreme
court
could
have
done
that
would
be
have
been
to
have
deny
the
application
of
a
statute,
there
is
no
discretion
in
that
statute.
they
would
have
had
to
do
it
on
the
base
of
constitutional
issues
--
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
that's
right.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
it
can
be
a
secure
surety
bond
or
cash
security
in
lieu
thereof.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
yes
sir.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
if
the
appellant,
the
loosing
party
does
not
pay
the
brief
cost
is
$2.65
--
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
no
your
honor,
it's
only
if
he
doesn't
pay
the
taxation
of
costs
that
are
included
in
the
mandate.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
right
your
honor.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
i
see
no
discretion
allow
the
court,
it's
an
absolute
requirement
in
the
statute.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
i
would
assume
sir
that
it
would.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
yes
your
honor.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
all
that
the
statute
says
is
that
it
is
conditioned
that
the
appellant
shall
pay
all
costs
adjudged
against
him
in
the
supreme
court
without
specification.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
yes
sir,
it
had
well
--
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
then
it
would
not.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
well
no,
it's
released.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
it
would
be
a
minimum
of
$20.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
minimum,
in
some
cases
there
are
some
companies
that
do
permit
a
$10
fee,
but
it's
a
minimum
up
to
$1,000.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
none
other
than
the
$20
docket
fee
which
must
be
paid
in
advance.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
yes.
he
paid
$20
to
the
state
for
his
docket
fee
and
$88.58
to
the
gnat
publishing
company
of
lincoln.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
no
he
pays
a
$5
appearance
fee,
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
just
two
minutes,
if
you
may
your
honor.
first,
you
can't,
in
nebraska,
stipulate
the
jurisdiction
as
far
as
the
paternity
issue.
he
said
that
he
will
be
willing
to
stipulate,
i
just
wanted
the
court
to
know
that
a
stipulation
of
counsel
will
not
vest
any
court
with
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
matter.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
right,
and
as
to
one
point
with
respect
to
the
lindsey
versus
normet
case,
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
distinguishing
characteristic
of
that
bond
or
payment
provision
for
rent
pending
appeal
and
the
court
said,
there
are
unique
facts
and
legal
characteristics
of
landlord-tenant
relationship
that
justifies
special
statutory
treatment
inapplicable
to
other
litigants
and
then
goes
on
to
refer
to
the
fact
that
the
landlord
is
incurring
expenses
and
the
tenant
will
be
getting
free
occupation.
so
i
reiterate
my
statement
in
my
original
presentation
that
the
original
or
bond
covering
the
payment
of
the
actual
rent
is
distinguishable
from
this
case.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
i
would
hope
it
would.
i
would
want
this
court
to,
i
think
give
it
a
bit
of
a
nudge
your
honor.
if
they
could
have
a
chance
to
interpret
this
contrary
to
applying
of
section
lb
1120,
they
might
do
it.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
thank
you.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
on
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
nebraska
and
involves
in
its
essence
a
--
several
questions
involving
the
annulment
of
a
marriage,
a
determination
of
paternity
and
the
allowance
or
granting
or
the
violation
thereof
the
right
to
be
present
at
trial.
these
proceedings
now
before
the
court
commenced
by
the
filing
of
a
petition
for
annulment
in
the
district
court
of
hall
county,
nebraska,
grand
island
approximately
in
the
middle
of
the
state.
the
defendant
in
that
case,
petitioner
here
harold
eugene
hoffman
was
at
that
time
incarcerated
in
the
state
penitentiary
in
lincoln,
nebraska
approximately
a
110
miles
away.
throughout
the
proceedings,
mr.
huffman
appeared
pro
se
until
the
appointment
of
counsel
by
this
court
in
response
to
his
request
for
a
writ
of
certiorari.
the
essential
facts,
as
we
view
them,
would
be
that
on
march
5,
1969,
these
two
parties,
harold
eugene
hoffman
and
faye
boersen
were
married
in
las
vegas,
nevada.
at
that
time,
the
parties
had
been
living
in
hamilton
county,
adjoining
hall
county
in
a
small
town
known
as
giltner,
nebraska.
at
that
time,
there
was
--
there
had
been
filed
by
faye,
a
petition
for
divorce
from
a
marriage
contracted
according
to
the
record
with
richard
a.
boersen
and
with
respect
to
whom
there
were
two
children
at
that
time
of
the
marriage.
now
the,
and
i
will
get
into
the
facts
in
a
little
more
detail,
the
petitioner's
view
of
the
issues
in
this
case
are
in
two
general
areas,
and
that
is,
was
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
violated
with
respect
to
the
petitioner
by
reason
of
the
dismissal
of
his
appeal
in
that
annulment
case
by
the
nebraska
supreme
court
because
he
failed
to
file
a
$75
cost
security,
bond
or
cash
in
lieu
thereof,
and
secondly,
were
his
rights
to
be
present
at
the
trial
violated
when
he
was
incarcerated
at
the
state
penitentiary
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
the
facts
are
not
in
dispute
and
although
there
are
lengthy
pleadings
on
file,
a
distillation
of
those
facts
in
our
opinion
could
not
make
the
facts
very
complicated.
now,
before
referring
to
these
additional
facts,
i
would
like
to
footnote
nebraska
provisions
dealing
with
the
matter
of
appeal.
since
its
founding,
the
state
of
nebraska
has
had
in
its
bill
of
rights,
a
provision,
guaranteeing
right
of
appeal
in
all
civil
cases.
article
1
section
24,
provides
the
right
to
be
heard
in
all
civil
cases
in
the
court
of
last
resort
by
appeal,
error
or
otherwise
shall
not
be
denied,
and
as
announced
by
a
long
line
of
nebraska
cases,
more
particularly
as
it
applies
to
this
case
and
we've
cited
in
our
brief,
the
case
of
ferber
versus
leise
which
held
that
this
right
of
appeal
exists
irrespective
of
the
merits
or
the
lack
thereof
in
the
court
or
in
the
record.
in
other
words,
they
take
the
position
that
our
supreme
court
should
not
consider
a
case
until
it's
been
properly
presented
and
not
try
to
anticipate
whether
or
not
the
appeal
is
frivolous
or
has
some
substance.
now
the
records
shows
that
faye
had
been
married
to
or
entered
into
a
marriage
ceremony
with
richard
boersen
in
june
of
1964.
and
she
had
filed
an
action
for
divorce,
well,
there
were
two
of
them,
but
the
one
involved
is
in
february
of
1969
and
that
action
boersen
had
filed
a
counter
suit.
then
on
march
5,
as
i
stated,
she
married
the
petitioner
in
las
vegas,
nevada.
and
about
a-month-and-a-half
later,
april
24,
a
divorce
decree
was
entered.
in
october
of
that
year,
1969,
she
gave
birth
to
a
child,
a
child
which
the
petitioner
claims
paternity
and
is
also
one
of
the
issues
involved
in
this
case.
now,
in
november
1970,
faye
filed
the
petition
for
annulment
in
the
hall
county
district
court.
huffman
was
incarcerated
in
the
state
penitentiary
on
november
9.
the
sheriff
of
lancaster
county
pursuant
to
our
local
procedure
served
the
summons.
he
was
allowed
in
to
serve
the
summons
on
the
petitioner
and
service
in
written
was
made
of
that
fact.
in
the
pleadings
that
followed
as
i
said
all
filed
by
huffman
pro
se,
by
the
way
mr.
huffman
is
the
inmate's
legal
assistant
at
the
nebraska
penitentiary.
a
review
of
the
record
in
this
case
would
indicate
some
expertise
and
knowledge
on
his
part
that
might
not
be
possessed
of
an
ordinary
layman.
now,
among
the
pleadings
filed,
he
raised
the
issue
of
denial
of
her
right
to
annulment.
he
raised
the
issue
and
claimed
the
right
to
be
found
--
the
father
of
his
child
born
in
october
1969
and
he
also
demanded
in
several
pleadings
the
right
to
be
present
at
any
trial.
he
also
advised
the
court
that
he
was
without
funds
and
had
no
counsel.
now,
the
record
is
undisputed
that
about
that
time,
mr.
huffman
had
approximately
a
$114
of
resources
and
this
has
been
stipulated
and
admitted.
the
case
as
i
said
was
filed
in
november,
in
march
of
1971
faye's
attorney
ex
parte
asked
the
court
to
set
the
case
for
trial,
which
was
perfectly
in
line
with
local
procedure.
the
case
was
set
for
trial
on
march
26.
huffman
was
given
notice
of
that
trial,
again
by
the
sheriff
of
lancaster
county,
who
served
this
upon
him
on
march,
22.
on
that
same
day,
mr.
huffman
wrote
a
letter
to
the
judge,
which
appears
in
the
appendix
at
page
48,
stating
that
he
had
just
received
this
service
which
was
four
days
prior
to
the
trial,
that
he
had
no
counsel,
and
again,
renewed
his
demand
to
be
present.
now,
in
a
prior
document,
which
he
filed,
called
a
motion
for
appearance,
he
had
advised
the
court
of
the
same
facts
and
further
advised
the
court
that
all
it
took
was
a
simple
order
by
the
court
to
have
the
warden
produce
mr.
huffman
at
his
trial
on
the
annulment
in
grand
island.
on
march
26,
the
trial
took
place
and
a
decree
or
order
of
annulment
was
entered.
huffman's
pleadings
were
all
dismissed,
held
for
naught.
on
april
9,
huffman
filed
his
notice
of
appeal
and
this
is
all
in
accordance
with
nebraska
procedure
and
he
paid
a
$20
docket
fee
which
is
also
required
by
our
statute.
he
also
filed
praecipes
for
the
preparation
of
a
transcript,
preparation
of
a
bill
of
exceptions,
which
were
prepared;
the
transcript
by
the
clerk,
the
bill
of
exceptions
by
the
court
reporter
and
these
all
appear
in
the
appendix.
now
section
25,
1914
of
our
nebraska
statutes
among
other
things
requires
that
the
cost
security
of
$75
be
filed.
now
our
nebraska
statutes
have,
i
think,
as
most
states
do
requirements
which
must
be
followed
in
order
to
lodge
an
appeal
in
the
nebraska
supreme
court.
the
notice
of
appeal
and
the
$20
docket
fee
are
denominated
as
jurisdictional.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
no,
your
honor.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
this
was
all
on
documents.
well,
i
wish
to
withdraw
that.
mr.
dowding
did
appear
at
the
argument
in
the
supreme
court,
but
mr.
huffman
did
not,
he
was
in
the
penitentiary.
i
haven't
got
into
that
point,
but
in
the
supreme
court
the
--
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
no
sir,
it
was
raised
however
by
mr.
huffman
in
his
pleadings.
now
as
i
said,
he
filed
the
praecipes,
he
filed
a
notice
of
appeal
and
the
$20
docket
fee.
statute
requires
within
30
days
of
that
date,
the
cost
security
to
be
filed.
on
may
19,
faye's
attorney
filed
a
motion
in
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
to
dismiss
the
appeal
for
failure
to
file
the
cost
security.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
very
much
in
excess
of
that,
your
honor.
my
own
personal
experience
say,
even
a
small
brief
is
over
$200,
and
most
of
the
time
there
are
$300
and
$400
present
prices.
now
the
supreme
court
has
a
rule
which
provides
for
reimbursement
at
$2.60
of
pay
which
comes
to
$195.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
he
can
--
the
winning
party
in
the
appeal
gets
reimbursement
for
75
pages
x
$2.60,
which
is
taxed
as
cost.
only
the
appellant
however
must
file
a
cost
security.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
that's
right,
because
the
statutory
cost
as
far
as
the
state
are
concerned
in
an
appeal
are
taking
care
of
the
$20
docket
fee.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
in
excess
of
$3,
three
and
a
quarter.
sometimes
--
and
now
up
to
four,
depending
on
which
printer,
at
least
in
omaha.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
very
modern.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
that
statute
has
been
on
our
books
since
the
turn
of
the
century.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
no,
that's
quite
right.
i
would
like
to
respond
to
the
questions
as
they're
raised.
now
to
fill
you
in
--
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
yes.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
there
is
a
provision,
your
honor,
in
the
rules
of
the
nebraska
supreme
court,
which
provide
that
the
rule
9
(a)
of
the
supreme
court
which
is
quoted
on
page
5
of
our
brief
provides
in
part,
all
briefs
shall
be
printed
unless
otherwise
allowed
by
the
court
on
good
cause
shown.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
i
would
agree
with
that
statement
based
upon
the
background
and
experience
of
our
court,
our
nebraska
court
to
date.
the
provision
for
waiver
or
some
kind
of
amendment
that
that
refers
to.
i
have
no
knowledge
of
any
case
where
that
has
been
waived
or
there
has
been
any
change
about
it
or
even
a
provision
for
paying
it
on
the
installment
plan,
for
example,
or
provided
--
well,
they
wouldn't
be
for
payment
on
the
installment,
it
would
be
up
to
the
printer
and
the
petitioner
or
the
appellant.
but
the
waiver
of
that
or
the
right
to
provide
typed
briefs
has
not
to
my
experience
been
permitted
and
in
my
own
knowledge
as
far
as
the
bar
association
is
concerned,
we've
attempted
on
several
occasions
to
get
that
rule
amended
without
success.
that,
of
course,
is
outside
the
record.
when
faye's
attorney
filed
the
motion
to
dismiss
appeal
for
failing
to
supply
the
cost
security
or
huffman
was
given
notice
by
mail
and
he
at
that
time
filed
an
objection,
the
document
entitled
the
objection.
he
filed
a
motion
to
proceed
in
in
forma
pauperis.
he
filed
an
affidavit
and
also
filed
a
motion
to
stay
the
mandate
but
the
court
ruled
against
him
so
that
he
could
lodge
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
in
this
court.
the
appeal
was
dismissed
without
opinion,
just
an
order
entered
in
their
journal.
and
on
june
14,
there
was
a
hearing
at
which
faye's
attorney
was
present
and
i
might
advise
the
court
that
at
the
time
involved
mr.
huffman
had
ordered
a
brief
from
the
gant
publishing
company
in
lincoln,
nebraska
at
a
cost
of
$88.58,
which
had
to
be
paid
in
advance.
so
after
he
paid
the
$20
docket
fee
and
after
he
had
paid
the
printer,
his
$88.58,
he
had
less
than
$5
left
to
his
name
which
is
set
forth
in
his
affidavit.
the
money
that
he
--
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
there
is
no
case
in
the
state
where
a
waiver
has
been
granted.
there
are
one
or
two
decisions
only,
your
honor,
that
have
ruled
on
this
and
other
requirements
and
all
have
been
to
the
effect
that
these
are
reasonable
requirements
and
that
the
appeal
be
dismissed.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
although
it
isn't
classified
as
jurisdictional,
as
the
notice
of
appeal
and
the
$20
docket
fee,
it
has
the
same
effect.
you
are
dismissed
from
your
appeal
if
you
do
not
comply
with
it.
and
there
has
been
at
least
one
case
where
a
dismissal
has
occurred
because
of
this.
there
are
very
few
decisions,
one
or
two
at
the
most.
now
the
rule
involved
in
this
case
and
for
which
petitioner
seeks
redress
at
this
court
stems
mainly
from
the
rule
in
boddie
versus
connecticut,
decided
by
this
court
in
march
of
last
year.
the
court
in
boddie,
this
court
in
boddie
was
careful
to
announce
that
it
was
deciding
the
case
only
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
it
was
a
marital
situation,
allowance
of
an
indigent
to
file
a
divorce
petition,
and
because
the
state
exercised
control
over
it,
the
marital
relationship
in
its
dissolution,
it
held
that
this
case
then
merited
the
application
of
the
rule
that
had
long
been
in
effect
with
respect
to
criminal
cases.
now
on
that
basis
alone,
we
have
a
similarity
here
in
our
huffman
case.
we
have
an
annulment
and
a
matter
of
determination
of
paternity.
the
issue,
of
course,
goes
one
step
further
and
that
is
the
matter
of
appeal
and
it
is
petitioner's
opinion
that
the
rule
of
griffin
versus
illinois,
decided
in
1956,
is
applicable
here
and
also
the
cases
which
have
followed
griffin.
griffin
held
that
an
indigent
in
a
criminal
case
was
entitled
to
have
a
transcript
furnished
by
the
state,
if
he
could
not
afford
it
in
order
to
provide
him
with
an
appeal.
as
the
court
pointed
out,
appeal
is
not
required,
but
if
the
state
allows
appeals
as
a
general
practice
and
in
its
rules
and
procedures,
then
it
cannot
as
a
matter
of
equal
protection
of
the
law
deny
the
same
rights
to
indigents.
and
there
have
been
a
host
of
cases
following
griffin
in
the
criminal
field
and
the
rule
has
been
amplified,
for
example,
in
williams
versus
oklahoma
city
decided
in
1969
by
this
court,
extended
the
griffin
rule
to
a
quasi-criminal
case
which
was
a
violation
of
the
city
ordinance,
90-day
jail
sentence
and
a
small
fine.
it
also
involved
the
issue
of
free
transcript.
and
then
in
december
of
this
year,
in
mayor
versus
chicago,
this
court
extended
the
griffin
rule
to
a
misdemeanor
case
which
involved
a
fine
only.
and
based
upon
boddie,
which
extended
the
right
of
access
to
the
courts
in
a
marital
situation,
we
feel
mandates,
the
application
of
griffin
and
its
progeny
to
this
case.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
yes
i
realize,
this
is
a
distinction,
but
if
in
our
opinion
this
is
a
distinction
without
a
difference.
first
of
all,
it
is
state
action.
secondly,
it
is
a
minimal
protection.
thirdly,
it
makes
no
difference
as
we
see
at
whether
this
--
the
cost
requirement
in
the
handling
of
a
case
is
to
pay
a
fee
which
is
state
action
or
to
pay
a
printer
which
again
is
individual
action
or
to
pay
a
cost
security.
now
in
lindsey
against
normet
which
was
just
recently
decided
by
this
case
the
--
i
think
this
court
has
answered
that
question,
and
we
must
keep
in
mind
in
lindsey,
that
there
were
two
--
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
you
decided
that
the
double
appeal
was
not
valid
and
put
as
a
matter
of
equal
protection
of
the
law
cannot
be
imposed
upon
attainment.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
yes.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
that's
right
but
there
was
--
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
but
there
the
court
was
addressing
itself
protection
of
property
that
is
the
tenant
was
occupying
the
--
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
well,
but
it
did
not
address
itself
--
we're
talking
about
the
initial,
the
payment
or
requirement
of
paying
rent
during
the
pendency
of
the
action.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
but
it
applied
to
a
particular
situation
your
honor,
it
dealt
with
property
that
the
tenant
was
occupying,
it
was
this
case
and
the
matter
of
cost
are
not
opposite,
i
mean
are
not
consistent
or
the
same.
there
you
have
the
protection
or
as
the
rule
stated
protection
of
the
property
as
a
landlord,
or
to
protect
a
judgment
secured,
you
don't
have
that
here.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
well
at
least
--
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
that's
right,
if
it
denies
him
access
to
the
courts
and
this
has
already
been
the
court's
position
in
boddie.
there
was
no
requirement
to
there
so
far
as
protecting
the
other
party
and
here
in
boddie
there
was
a
waiver
of
the
filing
fees
which
the
state
mandated
as
well
as
what
the
sheriff
required.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
not
necessarily,
and
there
is
another
thing
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
point
out
in
that
regard.
in
the
filing
of
the
original
petitions,
state
of
nebraska
does
not
require
a
bond
to
protect
the
defendant,
if
the
plaintiff
loses
and
the
appeal,
only
the
appellant
must
file
this.
there
is
no
cost
security
given
to
the
appellee.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
yes,
it's
very
common
and
it
is
a
--
and
we
do
not
attack
the
essential
validity
of
that,
we
agree
that
this
is
a
valid
exercise
of
state
rights.
but
when
it
prevents
the
indigent
from
coming
into
court
or
getting
a
rights
of
appeal
without
any
regard
to
their
merits
then
it
is
an
invidious
discrimination
which
the
constitution
prescribes.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
they
could
your
honor
and
that
was
suggested
mr.
dowding
in
his
answer
brief.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
well
then
there
wouldn't
be
a
need
for
a
cost
security
either
because
the
only
purpose
of
the
cost
security
provides
in
the
--
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
no
your
honor.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
they
did.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
right,
but
the
court
does
not
permit
the
filing
of
typewritten
briefs
in
the
state
of
nebraska.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
i
know
that
the
rule
says
that
your
honor,
but
i
know
of
no
case
where
the
court
has
ever
done
it.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
that's
right,
the
only
thing
that
the
bond
protects
is
the
brief
printing
cost
of
the
appellee.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
my
client
did
not,
your
honor.
he
asked
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis
in
a
general
way
without
specifically
referring
to
this
provision.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
right,
he
asked
generally
for
the
right
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
i
would
say
no
your
honor,
on
the
basis
of
the
experience
of
the
nebraska
court
did
not
ever
varying
from
its
rule
requiring
printed
briefs.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
they
could.
yes
your
honor,
they
could.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
no,
as
to
the
cost
bond
there
is
no
discretion,
as
to
the
printing
of
the
briefs
there
would
be.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
well
the
statute,
29
--
25-1914
does
not
give
them
that
discretion,
it's
an
evidence.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
no,
your
honor,
you
would
not
need
a
cost
bond,
but
the
statute
does
not
give
that
discretion.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
right.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
your
honor,
the
only
way
that
i
see
that
the
nebraska
supreme
court
could
have
done
that
would
be
have
been
to
have
deny
the
application
of
a
statute,
there
is
no
discretion
in
that
statute.
they
would
have
had
to
do
it
on
the
base
of
constitutional
issues
--
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
that's
right.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
it
can
be
a
secure
surety
bond
or
cash
security
in
lieu
thereof.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
yes
sir.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
if
the
appellant,
the
loosing
party
does
not
pay
the
brief
cost
is
$2.65
--
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
no
your
honor,
it's
only
if
he
doesn't
pay
the
taxation
of
costs
that
are
included
in
the
mandate.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
right
your
honor.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
i
see
no
discretion
allow
the
court,
it's
an
absolute
requirement
in
the
statute.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
i
would
assume
sir
that
it
would.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
yes
your
honor.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
all
that
the
statute
says
is
that
it
is
conditioned
that
the
appellant
shall
pay
all
costs
adjudged
against
him
in
the
supreme
court
without
specification.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
yes
sir,
it
had
well
--
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
then
it
would
not.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
well
no,
it's
released.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
it
would
be
a
minimum
of
$20.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
minimum,
in
some
cases
there
are
some
companies
that
do
permit
a
$10
fee,
but
it's
a
minimum
up
to
$1,000.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
none
other
than
the
$20
docket
fee
which
must
be
paid
in
advance.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
yes.
he
paid
$20
to
the
state
for
his
docket
fee
and
$88.58
to
the
gnat
publishing
company
of
lincoln.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
no
he
pays
a
$5
appearance
fee,
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
just
two
minutes,
if
you
may
your
honor.
first,
you
can't,
in
nebraska,
stipulate
the
jurisdiction
as
far
as
the
paternity
issue.
he
said
that
he
will
be
willing
to
stipulate,
i
just
wanted
the
court
to
know
that
a
stipulation
of
counsel
will
not
vest
any
court
with
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
matter.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
right,
and
as
to
one
point
with
respect
to
the
lindsey
versus
normet
case,
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
distinguishing
characteristic
of
that
bond
or
payment
provision
for
rent
pending
appeal
and
the
court
said,
there
are
unique
facts
and
legal
characteristics
of
landlord-tenant
relationship
that
justifies
special
statutory
treatment
inapplicable
to
other
litigants
and
then
goes
on
to
refer
to
the
fact
that
the
landlord
is
incurring
expenses
and
the
tenant
will
be
getting
free
occupation.
so
i
reiterate
my
statement
in
my
original
presentation
that
the
original
or
bond
covering
the
payment
of
the
actual
rent
is
distinguishable
from
this
case.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
i
would
hope
it
would.
i
would
want
this
court
to,
i
think
give
it
a
bit
of
a
nudge
your
honor.
if
they
could
have
a
chance
to
interpret
this
contrary
to
applying
of
section
lb
1120,
they
might
do
it.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leo
eisenstatt
thank
you.
