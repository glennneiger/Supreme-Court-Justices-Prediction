mr.
eisenstatt,
as
a
matter
of
practicality,
how
much
protection
is
a
$75
bond
in
nebraska
practice?
what
is
the
average
--
what
do
the
average
cost
amount
to,
in
excess
of
that?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
now
that
we've
interrupted
you
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
could
i
ask
one
more
then
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
somewhere
in
here,
i
have
the
impression
that
there
is
a
statement
that
relief
from
printing
cannot
be
obtained
in
the
supreme
court
practices,
is
this
a
rule
in
your
state?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i
think
perhaps
in
the
opposition's
papers,
there
was
an
intimation
at
least
that
she
had
to
have
her
briefs
printed
and
could
get
no
relief
and
i
wondered
about
the
accuracy
of
that
statement?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
are
there
any
statutory
costs
as
such
to
in
your
nebraska
practice?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
does
the
appellee
pay
docket
fee
also?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
statute
was
past
pursuant
or
as
a
result
of
the
grant
of
cert
in
this
case,
was
it
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
dowding
let
me
go
to
the
other
issue
to
wet
my
curiosity?
doesn't
nebraska
ever
let
a
prisoner
out
to
defend
in
a
trial
court
of
the
state
in
action
of
this
kind
of
brought
against
him?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
know
why
such
an
order
wasn't
issued
in
this
case?
