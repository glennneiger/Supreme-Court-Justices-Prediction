mr.
black,
do
you
regard
this
factual
aspect
of
the
case
involving
the
security
guards
as
any
different
than
if
the
owner
of
a
single
standing
private
hardware
store
finding
someone
leaf-letting
inside
his
store,
they
didn't
want
to
call
the
police
and
asked
him
to
eject
him?
justice

mr.

where
on
the
exhibit
number
3,
at
page
115,
with
relation
to
that
main
building,
is
the

where
do
people
park
for
that
area?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
vehicular
traffic
to
and
from
the
parking
area
within
the
building
itself,
the
part
used
for
retail
merchandising?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
question
probably
wasn't
too
clear.
within
the
part
of
the
building
that
is
used
for
retail
merchandising
where
people
circulate
back
and
forth
from
the
stores,
is
there
any
vehicular
traffic?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
neil,
if
a
single
store
owner
found
someone
inside
his
store,
leafleting,
whom
he
felt
was
trespassing
and
called
the
portland
police
to
eject
him,
would
you
feel
that
brought
him
within
the
logan
valley
rule?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
right.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
does
the
presence
of
police
officers
hereby
itself
help
your
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
do
you
think
if
the
property
had
been
conveyed
and
fee
simple,
in
wilmington
the
same
result
would
have
obtained?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
your
portland
zoning
code
requires
site
plan
approval
for
most
major
retail
constructions?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
logan
valley
just
automatically
decide
this
case
that
--?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
what
about
--
logan
valley
at
least
said
--
noted
that
the
activity
was
connected
with
the
races.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
this
unrelated
speech?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
isn't
related
in
the
sense
the
activity
was
in
logan
valley.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let's
assume
that
it
isn't
related
--
your
argument
simply
covers
that
aspect.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let's
assume
that
it
isn't

then
what?
justice
william

what

the

of
a
