mr.
george
black
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
upon
the
issuance
of
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
case
involves
a
controversy
between
shopping
center
owner
and
an
anti-war
handbiller.
i
believe,
if
i
am
able
to
properly
describe
the
factual
situation
in
this
case,
it
will
be
found
not
to
be
the
same
factual
situation
as
in
marsh
against
alabama,
nor
in
logan
valley,
nor
in
central
hardware.
the
petitioner,
lloyd
corporation
is
the
owner
of
a
number
of
pieces
of
land
divided
by
public
streets
in
portland,
oregon,
used
for
shopping
centers,
as
a
shopping
center,
and
known
generally
as
lloyd
center
in
portland,
oregon.
the
respondents
in
this
case
are
individuals
who
represented,
what
they
termed
the
resistance,
advocating
resistance
to
the
military
draft.
their
handbills
were
anti-war,
anti-draft
handbills.
these
respondents
sought
to
distribute
their
handbills
on
certain
portions
of
petitioner's
land,
in
a
mall
or
walkway,
in
the
main
building
of
the
the
petitioner
in
lloyd
center.
may
i
refer
briefly
to
the
appendix
in
which
we
have
copied
photographs
of
the
center
map,
and
there
is
a
map,
first,
center
at
page
115.
i
would
--
also
at
page
116
is
an
aerial
photograph,
exhibit
number
4
of
the
center
and
similarly
another
aerial
photograph
at
page
117.
the
area,
that
is
the
entire
area
including
the
various
buildings
and
the
public
streets
in
the
center
and
the
main
building,
are
said
to
be
something
in
the
neighborhood
of
50
acres.
mr.
george
black
jr.
yes,
there
are,
they
run
through
the
various
parts
of
the
center,
mr.
justice
douglas.
none
run
through
the
main
building
which
is
really
the
subject
of
this
particular
handbilling.
mr.
george
black
jr.
there
are
pictures
of
the
malls
and
of
the
public
areas,
but
i
don't
think
that
there
is
a
picture
of
the
street
as
such.
mr.
george
black
jr.
yes,
the
map
that
i
understood
you
mean
in
addition
to
that
map
at
page
115.
that
will
show
the
public
streets.
i
think,
probably
it
will
answer
your
question.
that's
exhibit
number
3,
and
referring
to
it,
you
will
note
that
the
center
on
the
north
is
bound
by
what
is
known
as
broadway.
a
next
street
that
runs
through
the
center
is
known
as
weidler
street,
a
second
one
proceeding
on
down
the
map
is
known
as
halsey
street,
and
on
the
west
or
left-hand
side,
the
map
as
one
is
looking
at
it,
at
the
9
street,
on
the
east
is
i
think
16th
avenue
and
on
the
south,
bottom
part
of
the
map
here,
what
you
will
notice
is
multnomah
street,
plus
an
indentation
of
a
public
park
called
the
holiday
park
and
some
other
streets,
referring
further
to
this
map
which
maybe
is
the
easiest
way
to
explain
this.
there
is
a
dark
line
around
the
perimeter
of
lloyd
center
which
includes
the
private
areas
and
the
public
areas.
that
perimeter
is
approximately
one-and-a-half
miles.
with
reference
to
the
--
this
was
not
a
suburban
operation
as
such,
when
it
was
created.
these
lots
and
streets
were
there
at
the
time
lloyd
bought
that
property.
not
in
the
appendix
but
in
the
record,
is
a
map
of
the
city
of
portland,
which
i
think,
is
number
3(a),
the
exhibit
3(a),
which
shows
the
approximate
location
here
of
lloyd
center
in
the
city
of
portland.
if
i
may
take
a
moment
to
further
describe
this
particular
area,
iâ€™ve
applied
out
that
when
there
is
some
39
blocks,
and
the
blocks
there
are
200
feet
by
200
feet
with
streets
on
each
side
of
them,
some
39
blocks
were
intended
to
be
devoted
to
this
enterprise
in
1954.
there
were
certain
vacation
of
the
streets
in
some
of
the
area.
it
will
be
noticed
on
the
map,
and
to
the
large
building,
there
was
not
a
vacation
of
other
streets
in
the
area
and
instead
lloyd
corporation
following
usual
provisions
of
this
city
or
ordinance
of
portland,
donated
and
dedicated
other
properties
to
permit
the
widening
of
the
streets
and
sidewalks
in
other
parts
of
the
area.
i
don't
think
that
street
vacation
question
is
material
in
this
case
but
it
may
be
considered
material
by
the
respondents
in
the
case.
the
construction
of
the
center
which
is
important
so
i
would
give
it
one
more
moment
here,
there
were
two
buildings
built
with
streets
adjoining
them.
at
the
top
of
the
map,
there
were
two
more
buildings
built
later
on.
then
another
building,
each
with
public
street
surrounding
them
and
then
the
large
building
which
we
call
the
main
building,
which
has
in
it,
what
has
been
referred
to
as
a
mall
or
a
walkway,
a
lobby,
a
corridor
or
whatever
one
got
to
think.
mr.
george
black
jr.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
george
black
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
to
say
just
one
more
word
about
the
setting,
then
i
would
get
into
the
incident
and
discuss
a
little
law,
if
i
may.
the
place
where
this
handbilling
occurred
is
photographed
and
appears
at
pages
134
and
135
of
the
appendix.
perhaps,
in
one
of
the
interior
malls
or
walkways,
in
front
of
the
meier
&
frank
entrance
to
that
mall.
in
the
main
building,
that
i
have
described,
which
is
one
of
four,
in
this
lloyd
center,
which
in
turn
is
in
portland,
oregon.
all
the
--
i
would
like
to
say
--
mr.
george
black
jr.
the
lloyd
corporation
owns
the
ice
rink.
the
ice
rink
is
located
in
the
basement
and
there
is
a
big
opening
on
the
first
floor
where
people
who
are
walking
in
the
mall
can
look
down.
mr.
george
black
jr.
within
this
structure
which
we
call
a
building,
which
is
a
building,
it's
the
main
building.
however,
it's
a
large
building,
the
building
is
maybe,
is
built
in
the
form
of
a
latin
or
greek
cross
and
it's
about
900
feet,
there
on
the
length
of
about
500
feet
or
thereabout
on
the
cross
and
this
is
a
mall
area,
the
interior
of
the
building,
which
leads
from
the
public
streets
on
the
various
sides,
except
that
it
doesn't
take
anything
on
the
west.
mr.
george
black
jr.
no,
they
are
not
an
extension
of
the
streets
as
we
said.
mr.
george
black
jr.
people
can
come
from
a
public
street
into
the
mall,
yes.
mr.
george
black
jr.
they
cross
the
street.
mr.
george
black
jr.
correct,
they
cross
the
street.
now
on
the
west
side,
for
example,
in
order
to
get
in,
where
they'll
have
to
go
up
in
an
escalator
to
get
to
this
particular
mall
where
this
handbilling
took
place.
it's
the
difference
in
levels.
mr.
george
black
jr.
pardon,
sir.
mr.
george
black
jr.
no,
there
is
no
vehicular
traffic
in
the
mall.
mr.
george
black
jr.
well,
we
hope
there
is
a
great
deal
for
business
purposes.
mr.
george
black
jr.
well,
one
of
the
various
buildings
either
across
the
public
streets
or
in
this
main
building,
in
the
mall
there.
now
i
would
like
to
say
a
word
about
the
policy
of
the
petitioner
lloyd
corporation
because
that
was
one
of
the
allegations
in
the
complaint,
which
i
will
refer
to
in
a
moment.
and
before
the
logan
valley
case
was
decided
in
1968,
the
lloyd
corporation
had
a
policy
of
barring
all
handbilling
of
every
kind
and
character
in
that
area.
and
billing
by
tenants,
commercial,
non-commercial
or
handbilling
by
anyone
because
it
was
considered
to
be
detrimental
to
their
business,
detrimental
particularly
to
what
they
called
customer
motivation,
that
was
the
policy.
when
logan
valley
was
decided,
i
think,
it
was
about
march
in
1968,
we
changed
our
policy
to
permit
any
handbilling
that
could
come
in
there,
that
wanted
to
come
in
there,
if
it
was
related
directly
in
its
purpose
to
some
use
that
was
being
made
there
of
the
premises
by
lloyd
corporation
or
by
its
tenants.
for
example,
picketing
would
have
been
permitted
and
actually
was
conducted
inside
of
the
mall,
where
the
relationship
factor
was
present,
and
also
where
it
was
--
there
was
not
an
alternative
because
and
it
was
necessary
to
allow
the
person
to
come
in
to
get
to
the
particular
store.
in
order
to
do
the
picketing.
so
that
policy
was
changed
and
in
the
fall
of
1968,
november,
1968,
some
six
months
after
the
logan
valley
case,
this
incident
occurred
in
which
the
respondents,
as
i
have
stated,
they
were
advocating
what
they
called
the
resistance,
anti-war.
we
got
a
telephone
call,
that
they
would
be
coming
to
the
place
and
the
police
had
been
alerted
in
matters
of
that
kind.
mr.
george
black
jr.
that
the
map
--
mr.
george
black
jr.
it's
--
mr.
george
black
jr.
approximately,
in
the
center.
mr.
george
black
jr.
can
you
see
138
there,
right
block,
which
was
formally
block
138.
mr.
george
black
jr.
about
there,
within
20-30
feet
of
that,
i
can't
tell
you
exactly.
the
mall
area
extending
east
and
the
west
is
not
a
prolongation
of
the
streets
as
such
but
it
goes
from
the
west,
from
the
east
to
the
west,
however,
to
go
from
end
to
the
another,
you
have
to
change
the
levels.
but
that's
about
where
it
occurred.
also
their
entrance
is
up,
three
i
think,
entrance
is
up
to
halsey
street
to
north,
top
of
the
map,
and
there
are
two
or
three
entrances
down
to
multnomah
street
to
the
south
of
the
map.
mr.
george
black
jr.
there
was
no
problem
of
littering
in
connection
with
the
incident
involved
that
is
of
any
consequence.
however,
littering
is
a
factor,
one
of
the
many
factors,
not
at
all
important
one,
on
private
property.
littering,
of
course,
has
been
held
not
to
be
a
reason
to
deprive
a
person
of
constitutional
right
on
public
property,
but
littering
is
one
of
the
factors
in
the
case.
now
the
incident
here
is,
i
might
say
as
i
go
through
here
that
there
are
really
no
factual
questions
on
anything
that
is
brought
to
the
supreme
court
here.
the
whole
matter
is
a
matter
of
conclusion
of
law
and
in
regard
to
the
exact
character
of
the
incident
involved
where
that
can
be
found
on
page
17
of
the
appendix,
because
it's
copied
in
from
an
agreed
statement
or
facts
on
the
pretrial
order.
so
there
isn't
any
question
whatever
as
to
what
happened,
and
that's
the
second
division
of
the
agreed
facts
starting
on
page
16
and
page
17.
the
situation
briefly
was,
one
that
these
people
came
to
this
area
and
started
making
distribution
of
their
bills
in
this
private
mall
area
and
they
were
asked
by
the
guards;
the
security
guards
of
lloyd
corporation
to
remove
themselves
to
make
the
distribution
on
the
public
streets
in
that
area,
and
they
refused
to
do
so
and
there
was
as
--
at
first
and
there
was
a
controversy
and
subsequently,
however,
they
did
leave
and
they
finished
their
hand-billing
or
at
least
some
of
it
on
the
public
streets,
they
were
there
available
for
that
purpose.
now,
the
matter
of
legal
controversy
results
from
a
suit.
it
was
filed
by
the
respondents
against
the
petitioner
in
the
united
state
district
court
for
oregon,
asking
for
the
declaratory
judgment
injunction.
complaint
was
made
of
the
particular
incident
that
i
described
and
there
was
also
added
statement
that
it
was
the
policy
of
the
lloyd
corporation
not
to
permit
non-commercial
handbilling
of
any
character
in
these
private
malls
and
that
they
asked
for
a
declaratory
judgment
from
the
district
court
to
the
effect
that
non-commercial
handbilling
could
be
conducted
as
long
as
it
was
peaceful
and
orderly
and
as
long
as
whenever
the
premises
were
open
for
public
access.
now,
the
case
was
tried
on
the
district
court
and
the
court
held,
the
decision
by
the
way
of
the
court
is
copied
in,
as
a
part
of
the
appendix
that
is
attached
to
the
petition
in
this
case
for
the
writ
of
certiorari.
it's
at
14
(a)
is
the
particular
part
of
decision
that
i
want
to
comment
on.
the
court
held
that
the
privately
owned
mall,
petitioner's
main
building
there,
that
is
the
mall,
he
calls
it
the
malls
in
walkways
where
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
public
business
district,
citing
the
logan
valley
decision
and
stating
the
respondents
had
a
first
amendment
constitutional
right
under
the
free
speech,
provisions
of
it
to
distribute
handbills
there
when
the
property
was
open
to
public
access
as
long
as
it
was
peaceful
and
orderly.
mr.
george
black
jr.
yes.
not
all
of
it.
lloyd
corporation
brought
some
39
blocks,
200
feet
on
this
side
and
those
blocks
were
already
laid
out
with
streets
and
sidewalks
and
they
took
part
of
those,
i
think
18
blocks,
and
made
their
main
building.
the
other,
let's
say
it
was
a
four
building
belt.
the
other
buildings
were
left
on
the
lots,
except
for
one
or
two
instances.
so
that's
how
it
happened
that
there
were
public
streets
and
sidewalks
in
part
of
the
area,
but
not
in
all
of
it.
mr.
george
black
jr.
no,
you
mean
was
it
a
clean
deal?
mr.
george
black
jr.
it
was
a
clean
deal
and
that
is
copied
into
this
appendix,
retained
no
interest
of
any
kind
or
character.
mr.
george
black
jr.
that's
right.
that's
lloyd's
action,
no
requirement
of
the
city.
it's
a
lloyd's
action
in
order
to
facilitate
their
acting
as
guards
in
keeping
order
in
the
place.
mr.
george
black
jr.
i
can't
answer
that
accurately.
i
am
sure
--
mr.
george
black
jr.
i
am
sure
it's
done
in
places
where
they're
large
enough
to
have
security
guards
and
things
of
that
character.
for
example,
the
people
in
bank
lobbies
and
things
like
that.
i
think
they
are
commissioned,
but
i
can't
make
that
representation
to
you,
because
i
don't
know.
mr.
george
black
jr.
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
so,
i
think
that
just
for
maintenance
or
order.
i
don't
think
that;
that
has
anything
to
do
with
making
it
a
municipality.
mr.
george
black
jr.
i
don't
know
that
case,
i
am
sorry.
mr.
george
black
jr.
well,
i
think
--
mr.
george
black
jr.
well,
i
think
this.
i
think,
for
example,
if
i
personally
own
that
entire
place
and
i
put
somebody
out
physically
in
my
own
hands,
i
suppose
they
wouldn't
have
any
right
to
sue
me
for
violation
of
constitutional
rights.
but
on
the
other
hand,
if
i
called
the
policeman
and
if
i
had
a
policeman
do
it,
and
i
charged
the
man
with
the
trespass
under
the
oregon
state
law,
and
he
was
arrested
on
that
basis,
that
would
constitute
state
law,
but
would
use
that
place
as
a
public
place
or
--
mr.
george
black
jr.
no,
they
have
never
done
so,
and
did
not
--
mr.
george
black
jr.
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
george
black
jr.
to
arrest
the
trespasser?
mr.
george
black
jr.
i
don't
think
any
specific
authority.
mr.
george
black
jr.
they
didn't
and
they
were
instructed
not
to
do
any
arresting,
and
they
didn't
do
any
arresting.
mr.
george
black
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
black
jr.
i
think
so,
yes.
mr.
george
black
jr.
i
don't
think
so,
i
haven't
thought
so.
i
haven't
felt
that
that
had
anything
to
do
with
the
question
of
whether
this
place
was
considered
to
be
a
sort
of
a
municipality
like
logan
valley.
mr.
george
black
jr.
no,
i
don't.
i
don't
know
if
i
exactly
get
your
point?
mr.
george
black
jr.
there
were
no
arrests
made.
mr.
george
black
jr.
the
guards
were
there
and
--
mr.
george
black
jr.
yeah,
that's
right.
that
was
acts
and
they
were
the
ones
that
told
and
then
asked
the
people
to
do
their
handbilling
in
the
public
place.
mr.
george
black
jr.
yes.
mr.
george
black
jr.
they
were
asked
to
leave,
because
it
was
our
private
property
and
then
we
had
a
policy
against
handbilling
and
the
handbilling
bore
no
relation
whatever
to
anything
that
we
were
doing
there.
mr.
george
black
jr.
they
are
violating
a
rule
of
policy
that
lloyd
had.
mr.
george
black
jr.
well,
it
wasn't
the
city
police,
we
had
the
security
guards,
as
far
as
that's
concerned,
it
was
the
manager
of
the
place
too,
discussing
the
matter
with
them
but
it
wasn't
a
matter
of
calling
of
police.
no
police
were
called
as
such.
they
were
just
told
that
it
was
a
policy
and
it
had
been
the
policy
for
eight
years
and
were
asked
to
--
mr.
george
black
jr.
they
have
a
uniform,
but
not
the
uniform
of
the
city
police.
mr.
george
black
jr.
i
wouldn't
think
so.
people,
generally,
i
don't
know.
mr.
george
black
jr.
i
don't
find
it
any
different
than
if
the
owner
had
simply
asked
people
to
leave.
that's
all
that
happened.
they
asked
them
to
leave.
there
was
no
arrest
made,
they
were
just
asked
to
do
their
handbilling,
told
of
the
policy
of
the
company.
they
were
told
that
they
could
be
arrested
for
trespass,
they
were
told
that
and
there
was
some
testimony,
your
honor,
in
the
case
that
was
a
little
bit
different
than
the
stipulated
facts.
one
witness
testified
that
he
had
been
threatened
with
arrest
and
the
district
judge
considered
that
to
be
sufficient
state
action
in
order
to
justify
the
united
states
district
court
having
jurisdiction
under
the
civil
rights
statute
in
order
to
hear
the
case.
mr.
george
black
jr.
yes.
mr.
george
black
jr.
the
lloyd
corporation
selects
them
and
hires
them,
and
would
have
the
right
to
fire
them.
mr.
george
black
jr.
none
at
all,
absolutely
none.
mr.
george
black
jr.
mr.
black,
why
the
lloyd
hasn't
commissioned
by
the
city?
mr.
george
black
jr.
i
think
it's
a
matter
of
convenience,
there
is
shoplifting
in
the
place
of
that
character
and
the
other
disturbances
and
if
these
men
were
just
a
attendants
as
such,
they
wouldn't
have
the
--
at
least
they
demonstrated
in
the
apparent
power
to
cause
the
incident
to
be
taken
care
of.
mr.
george
black
jr.
so
they
did
have
apparent
powers
to
the
city
police?
mr.
george
black
jr.
well,
i
think
the
evidence
shows
is
that
they
had,
what
can
i
call
a
special
police
commission
authorizing
them,
but
they
didn't
exercise
it
in
this
case
other
than
to
explain
the
policy.
mr.
george
black
jr.
but
they
did
extensively
have
it?
one
man
thought
he
had
because
he
said
he
was
threatened
with
arrest.
mr.
george
black
jr.
well,
that's
--
but
anybody
could
threatened
anybody
for
arrest
as
such
you
don't
have
to
be
a
policeman.
mr.
george
black
jr.
well,
wouldn't
it
be
a
little
different
if
the
man
had
a
uniform
on?
mr.
george
black
jr.
pardon,
sir.
mr.
george
black
jr.
would
it
be
little
different,
man
in
a
uniform,
a
gun
and
a
--
mr.
george
black
jr.
yeah,
but
i
don't
know
if
they
had
a
gun,
and
a
lot
of
these
(inaudible).
mr.
george
black
jr.
this
is
a
large
place
and
it's
for
the
protection
of
the
public,
things
of
that
character.
we
pay
the
taxes
and
administer
the
entire
situation
of
the
city
as
such.
just
proceeding,
i
think
i
have
told
you
about
the
ninth
circuit
decided,
the
ninth
--
rather
the
district
court
failed
to
give
any
attention
to
our
contention
and
that
this
handbilling
had
no
relation
at
all
to
the
use
that
we
were
making
of
the
premises
and
also
that
i
got
--
mr.
george
black
jr.
there
were
some
--
mr.
george
black
jr.
once
every
four
years,
they
ask
them
to
come
in
order
to
bring
people
to
the
place,
and
that
was
the
extent,
all
other
political
speeches
and
talks
were
turned
down,
they
were
not
permitted.
it
was
generally
not
permitted.
and
if
that--
mr.
george
black
jr.
i
think
it's
all
irrelevant,
i
think
that
case
is
irrelevant,
just
like
i
think
that
that
veterans
--
mr.
george
black
jr.
well,
i
think
this,
mr.
justice
white,
i
don't
know
the
department
store
or
any
merchant
that
doesn't
put
on
some
kind
of
promotion
in
order
to
get
the
people
into
his
place,
and
there
was
promotions.
mr.
george
black
jr.
well,
but
we
want
to
attract
the
kind
of
people
we
think
are
going
to
be
customers
there
and
not
that,
i
don't
think
that's
possibly
any
crowd.
mr.
george
black
jr.
yes,
i
think
the
first
amendment
would
take
over
if
it
were
in
a
public
place
and
be
entirely
different
than
its
private
setup
i
think.
but
i
think
the
fact
that
operating
a
store
setup
with
your
various
tenants,
i
think
the
promotional
feature
is
completely
incompetent
and
really
competent
and
irrelevant
in
this
case.
mr.
george
black
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
george
black
jr.
no,
on
page
193?
mr.
george
black
jr.
yes
it
refers
to
the
--
like
the,
that
ordinance
and
the
one
that
was
the
ordinance
--
one
of
the
ordinances,
they
are
all
copied
there.
193
is
the
last
one
that's
on
page
193.
that's
the
one
where
the
city
certified
that
lloyd
had
completed
all
of
its
obligations
in
connection
to
the
exchange
of
properties.
mr.
george
black
jr.
no,
specific
ordinance
applicable
to
the
application
for
vacations,
thank
you.
mr.
george
black
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
upon
the
issuance
of
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
case
involves
a
controversy
between
shopping
center
owner
and
an
anti-war
handbiller.
i
believe,
if
i
am
able
to
properly
describe
the
factual
situation
in
this
case,
it
will
be
found
not
to
be
the
same
factual
situation
as
in
marsh
against
alabama,
nor
in
logan
valley,
nor
in
central
hardware.
the
petitioner,
lloyd
corporation
is
the
owner
of
a
number
of
pieces
of
land
divided
by
public
streets
in
portland,
oregon,
used
for
shopping
centers,
as
a
shopping
center,
and
known
generally
as
lloyd
center
in
portland,
oregon.
the
respondents
in
this
case
are
individuals
who
represented,
what
they
termed
the
resistance,
advocating
resistance
to
the
military
draft.
their
handbills
were
anti-war,
anti-draft
handbills.
these
respondents
sought
to
distribute
their
handbills
on
certain
portions
of
petitioner's
land,
in
a
mall
or
walkway,
in
the
main
building
of
the
the
petitioner
in
lloyd
center.
may
i
refer
briefly
to
the
appendix
in
which
we
have
copied
photographs
of
the
center
map,
and
there
is
a
map,
first,
center
at
page
115.
i
would
--
also
at
page
116
is
an
aerial
photograph,
exhibit
number
4
of
the
center
and
similarly
another
aerial
photograph
at
page
117.
the
area,
that
is
the
entire
area
including
the
various
buildings
and
the
public
streets
in
the
center
and
the
main
building,
are
said
to
be
something
in
the
neighborhood
of
50
acres.
mr.
george
black
jr.
yes,
there
are,
they
run
through
the
various
parts
of
the
center,
mr.
justice
douglas.
none
run
through
the
main
building
which
is
really
the
subject
of
this
particular
handbilling.
mr.
george
black
jr.
there
are
pictures
of
the
malls
and
of
the
public
areas,
but
i
don't
think
that
there
is
a
picture
of
the
street
as
such.
mr.
george
black
jr.
yes,
the
map
that
i
understood
you
mean
in
addition
to
that
map
at
page
115.
that
will
show
the
public
streets.
i
think,
probably
it
will
answer
your
question.
that's
exhibit
number
3,
and
referring
to
it,
you
will
note
that
the
center
on
the
north
is
bound
by
what
is
known
as
broadway.
a
next
street
that
runs
through
the
center
is
known
as
weidler
street,
a
second
one
proceeding
on
down
the
map
is
known
as
halsey
street,
and
on
the
west
or
left-hand
side,
the
map
as
one
is
looking
at
it,
at
the
9
street,
on
the
east
is
i
think
16th
avenue
and
on
the
south,
bottom
part
of
the
map
here,
what
you
will
notice
is
multnomah
street,
plus
an
indentation
of
a
public
park
called
the
holiday
park
and
some
other
streets,
referring
further
to
this
map
which
maybe
is
the
easiest
way
to
explain
this.
there
is
a
dark
line
around
the
perimeter
of
lloyd
center
which
includes
the
private
areas
and
the
public
areas.
that
perimeter
is
approximately
one-and-a-half
miles.
with
reference
to
the
--
this
was
not
a
suburban
operation
as
such,
when
it
was
created.
these
lots
and
streets
were
there
at
the
time
lloyd
bought
that
property.
not
in
the
appendix
but
in
the
record,
is
a
map
of
the
city
of
portland,
which
i
think,
is
number
3(a),
the
exhibit
3(a),
which
shows
the
approximate
location
here
of
lloyd
center
in
the
city
of
portland.
if
i
may
take
a
moment
to
further
describe
this
particular
area,
iâ€™ve
applied
out
that
when
there
is
some
39
blocks,
and
the
blocks
there
are
200
feet
by
200
feet
with
streets
on
each
side
of
them,
some
39
blocks
were
intended
to
be
devoted
to
this
enterprise
in
1954.
there
were
certain
vacation
of
the
streets
in
some
of
the
area.
it
will
be
noticed
on
the
map,
and
to
the
large
building,
there
was
not
a
vacation
of
other
streets
in
the
area
and
instead
lloyd
corporation
following
usual
provisions
of
this
city
or
ordinance
of
portland,
donated
and
dedicated
other
properties
to
permit
the
widening
of
the
streets
and
sidewalks
in
other
parts
of
the
area.
i
don't
think
that
street
vacation
question
is
material
in
this
case
but
it
may
be
considered
material
by
the
respondents
in
the
case.
the
construction
of
the
center
which
is
important
so
i
would
give
it
one
more
moment
here,
there
were
two
buildings
built
with
streets
adjoining
them.
at
the
top
of
the
map,
there
were
two
more
buildings
built
later
on.
then
another
building,
each
with
public
street
surrounding
them
and
then
the
large
building
which
we
call
the
main
building,
which
has
in
it,
what
has
been
referred
to
as
a
mall
or
a
walkway,
a
lobby,
a
corridor
or
whatever
one
got
to
think.
mr.
george
black
jr.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
george
black
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
to
say
just
one
more
word
about
the
setting,
then
i
would
get
into
the
incident
and
discuss
a
little
law,
if
i
may.
the
place
where
this
handbilling
occurred
is
photographed
and
appears
at
pages
134
and
135
of
the
appendix.
perhaps,
in
one
of
the
interior
malls
or
walkways,
in
front
of
the
meier
&
frank
entrance
to
that
mall.
in
the
main
building,
that
i
have
described,
which
is
one
of
four,
in
this
lloyd
center,
which
in
turn
is
in
portland,
oregon.
all
the
--
i
would
like
to
say
--
mr.
george
black
jr.
the
lloyd
corporation
owns
the
ice
rink.
the
ice
rink
is
located
in
the
basement
and
there
is
a
big
opening
on
the
first
floor
where
people
who
are
walking
in
the
mall
can
look
down.
mr.
george
black
jr.
within
this
structure
which
we
call
a
building,
which
is
a
building,
it's
the
main
building.
however,
it's
a
large
building,
the
building
is
maybe,
is
built
in
the
form
of
a
latin
or
greek
cross
and
it's
about
900
feet,
there
on
the
length
of
about
500
feet
or
thereabout
on
the
cross
and
this
is
a
mall
area,
the
interior
of
the
building,
which
leads
from
the
public
streets
on
the
various
sides,
except
that
it
doesn't
take
anything
on
the
west.
mr.
george
black
jr.
no,
they
are
not
an
extension
of
the
streets
as
we
said.
mr.
george
black
jr.
people
can
come
from
a
public
street
into
the
mall,
yes.
mr.
george
black
jr.
they
cross
the
street.
mr.
george
black
jr.
correct,
they
cross
the
street.
now
on
the
west
side,
for
example,
in
order
to
get
in,
where
they'll
have
to
go
up
in
an
escalator
to
get
to
this
particular
mall
where
this
handbilling
took
place.
it's
the
difference
in
levels.
mr.
george
black
jr.
pardon,
sir.
mr.
george
black
jr.
no,
there
is
no
vehicular
traffic
in
the
mall.
mr.
george
black
jr.
well,
we
hope
there
is
a
great
deal
for
business
purposes.
mr.
george
black
jr.
well,
one
of
the
various
buildings
either
across
the
public
streets
or
in
this
main
building,
in
the
mall
there.
now
i
would
like
to
say
a
word
about
the
policy
of
the
petitioner
lloyd
corporation
because
that
was
one
of
the
allegations
in
the
complaint,
which
i
will
refer
to
in
a
moment.
and
before
the
logan
valley
case
was
decided
in
1968,
the
lloyd
corporation
had
a
policy
of
barring
all
handbilling
of
every
kind
and
character
in
that
area.
and
billing
by
tenants,
commercial,
non-commercial
or
handbilling
by
anyone
because
it
was
considered
to
be
detrimental
to
their
business,
detrimental
particularly
to
what
they
called
customer
motivation,
that
was
the
policy.
when
logan
valley
was
decided,
i
think,
it
was
about
march
in
1968,
we
changed
our
policy
to
permit
any
handbilling
that
could
come
in
there,
that
wanted
to
come
in
there,
if
it
was
related
directly
in
its
purpose
to
some
use
that
was
being
made
there
of
the
premises
by
lloyd
corporation
or
by
its
tenants.
for
example,
picketing
would
have
been
permitted
and
actually
was
conducted
inside
of
the
mall,
where
the
relationship
factor
was
present,
and
also
where
it
was
--
there
was
not
an
alternative
because
and
it
was
necessary
to
allow
the
person
to
come
in
to
get
to
the
particular
store.
in
order
to
do
the
picketing.
so
that
policy
was
changed
and
in
the
fall
of
1968,
november,
1968,
some
six
months
after
the
logan
valley
case,
this
incident
occurred
in
which
the
respondents,
as
i
have
stated,
they
were
advocating
what
they
called
the
resistance,
anti-war.
we
got
a
telephone
call,
that
they
would
be
coming
to
the
place
and
the
police
had
been
alerted
in
matters
of
that
kind.
mr.
george
black
jr.
that
the
map
--
mr.
george
black
jr.
it's
--
mr.
george
black
jr.
approximately,
in
the
center.
mr.
george
black
jr.
can
you
see
138
there,
right
block,
which
was
formally
block
138.
mr.
george
black
jr.
about
there,
within
20-30
feet
of
that,
i
can't
tell
you
exactly.
the
mall
area
extending
east
and
the
west
is
not
a
prolongation
of
the
streets
as
such
but
it
goes
from
the
west,
from
the
east
to
the
west,
however,
to
go
from
end
to
the
another,
you
have
to
change
the
levels.
but
that's
about
where
it
occurred.
also
their
entrance
is
up,
three
i
think,
entrance
is
up
to
halsey
street
to
north,
top
of
the
map,
and
there
are
two
or
three
entrances
down
to
multnomah
street
to
the
south
of
the
map.
mr.
george
black
jr.
there
was
no
problem
of
littering
in
connection
with
the
incident
involved
that
is
of
any
consequence.
however,
littering
is
a
factor,
one
of
the
many
factors,
not
at
all
important
one,
on
private
property.
littering,
of
course,
has
been
held
not
to
be
a
reason
to
deprive
a
person
of
constitutional
right
on
public
property,
but
littering
is
one
of
the
factors
in
the
case.
now
the
incident
here
is,
i
might
say
as
i
go
through
here
that
there
are
really
no
factual
questions
on
anything
that
is
brought
to
the
supreme
court
here.
the
whole
matter
is
a
matter
of
conclusion
of
law
and
in
regard
to
the
exact
character
of
the
incident
involved
where
that
can
be
found
on
page
17
of
the
appendix,
because
it's
copied
in
from
an
agreed
statement
or
facts
on
the
pretrial
order.
so
there
isn't
any
question
whatever
as
to
what
happened,
and
that's
the
second
division
of
the
agreed
facts
starting
on
page
16
and
page
17.
the
situation
briefly
was,
one
that
these
people
came
to
this
area
and
started
making
distribution
of
their
bills
in
this
private
mall
area
and
they
were
asked
by
the
guards;
the
security
guards
of
lloyd
corporation
to
remove
themselves
to
make
the
distribution
on
the
public
streets
in
that
area,
and
they
refused
to
do
so
and
there
was
as
--
at
first
and
there
was
a
controversy
and
subsequently,
however,
they
did
leave
and
they
finished
their
hand-billing
or
at
least
some
of
it
on
the
public
streets,
they
were
there
available
for
that
purpose.
now,
the
matter
of
legal
controversy
results
from
a
suit.
it
was
filed
by
the
respondents
against
the
petitioner
in
the
united
state
district
court
for
oregon,
asking
for
the
declaratory
judgment
injunction.
complaint
was
made
of
the
particular
incident
that
i
described
and
there
was
also
added
statement
that
it
was
the
policy
of
the
lloyd
corporation
not
to
permit
non-commercial
handbilling
of
any
character
in
these
private
malls
and
that
they
asked
for
a
declaratory
judgment
from
the
district
court
to
the
effect
that
non-commercial
handbilling
could
be
conducted
as
long
as
it
was
peaceful
and
orderly
and
as
long
as
whenever
the
premises
were
open
for
public
access.
now,
the
case
was
tried
on
the
district
court
and
the
court
held,
the
decision
by
the
way
of
the
court
is
copied
in,
as
a
part
of
the
appendix
that
is
attached
to
the
petition
in
this
case
for
the
writ
of
certiorari.
it's
at
14
(a)
is
the
particular
part
of
decision
that
i
want
to
comment
on.
the
court
held
that
the
privately
owned
mall,
petitioner's
main
building
there,
that
is
the
mall,
he
calls
it
the
malls
in
walkways
where
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
public
business
district,
citing
the
logan
valley
decision
and
stating
the
respondents
had
a
first
amendment
constitutional
right
under
the
free
speech,
provisions
of
it
to
distribute
handbills
there
when
the
property
was
open
to
public
access
as
long
as
it
was
peaceful
and
orderly.
mr.
george
black
jr.
yes.
not
all
of
it.
lloyd
corporation
brought
some
39
blocks,
200
feet
on
this
side
and
those
blocks
were
already
laid
out
with
streets
and
sidewalks
and
they
took
part
of
those,
i
think
18
blocks,
and
made
their
main
building.
the
other,
let's
say
it
was
a
four
building
belt.
the
other
buildings
were
left
on
the
lots,
except
for
one
or
two
instances.
so
that's
how
it
happened
that
there
were
public
streets
and
sidewalks
in
part
of
the
area,
but
not
in
all
of
it.
mr.
george
black
jr.
no,
you
mean
was
it
a
clean
deal?
mr.
george
black
jr.
it
was
a
clean
deal
and
that
is
copied
into
this
appendix,
retained
no
interest
of
any
kind
or
character.
mr.
george
black
jr.
that's
right.
that's
lloyd's
action,
no
requirement
of
the
city.
it's
a
lloyd's
action
in
order
to
facilitate
their
acting
as
guards
in
keeping
order
in
the
place.
mr.
george
black
jr.
i
can't
answer
that
accurately.
i
am
sure
--
mr.
george
black
jr.
i
am
sure
it's
done
in
places
where
they're
large
enough
to
have
security
guards
and
things
of
that
character.
for
example,
the
people
in
bank
lobbies
and
things
like
that.
i
think
they
are
commissioned,
but
i
can't
make
that
representation
to
you,
because
i
don't
know.
mr.
george
black
jr.
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
so,
i
think
that
just
for
maintenance
or
order.
i
don't
think
that;
that
has
anything
to
do
with
making
it
a
municipality.
mr.
george
black
jr.
i
don't
know
that
case,
i
am
sorry.
mr.
george
black
jr.
well,
i
think
--
mr.
george
black
jr.
well,
i
think
this.
i
think,
for
example,
if
i
personally
own
that
entire
place
and
i
put
somebody
out
physically
in
my
own
hands,
i
suppose
they
wouldn't
have
any
right
to
sue
me
for
violation
of
constitutional
rights.
but
on
the
other
hand,
if
i
called
the
policeman
and
if
i
had
a
policeman
do
it,
and
i
charged
the
man
with
the
trespass
under
the
oregon
state
law,
and
he
was
arrested
on
that
basis,
that
would
constitute
state
law,
but
would
use
that
place
as
a
public
place
or
--
mr.
george
black
jr.
no,
they
have
never
done
so,
and
did
not
--
mr.
george
black
jr.
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
george
black
jr.
to
arrest
the
trespasser?
mr.
george
black
jr.
i
don't
think
any
specific
authority.
mr.
george
black
jr.
they
didn't
and
they
were
instructed
not
to
do
any
arresting,
and
they
didn't
do
any
arresting.
mr.
george
black
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
black
jr.
i
think
so,
yes.
mr.
george
black
jr.
i
don't
think
so,
i
haven't
thought
so.
i
haven't
felt
that
that
had
anything
to
do
with
the
question
of
whether
this
place
was
considered
to
be
a
sort
of
a
municipality
like
logan
valley.
mr.
george
black
jr.
no,
i
don't.
i
don't
know
if
i
exactly
get
your
point?
mr.
george
black
jr.
there
were
no
arrests
made.
mr.
george
black
jr.
the
guards
were
there
and
--
mr.
george
black
jr.
yeah,
that's
right.
that
was
acts
and
they
were
the
ones
that
told
and
then
asked
the
people
to
do
their
handbilling
in
the
public
place.
mr.
george
black
jr.
yes.
mr.
george
black
jr.
they
were
asked
to
leave,
because
it
was
our
private
property
and
then
we
had
a
policy
against
handbilling
and
the
handbilling
bore
no
relation
whatever
to
anything
that
we
were
doing
there.
mr.
george
black
jr.
they
are
violating
a
rule
of
policy
that
lloyd
had.
mr.
george
black
jr.
well,
it
wasn't
the
city
police,
we
had
the
security
guards,
as
far
as
that's
concerned,
it
was
the
manager
of
the
place
too,
discussing
the
matter
with
them
but
it
wasn't
a
matter
of
calling
of
police.
no
police
were
called
as
such.
they
were
just
told
that
it
was
a
policy
and
it
had
been
the
policy
for
eight
years
and
were
asked
to
--
mr.
george
black
jr.
they
have
a
uniform,
but
not
the
uniform
of
the
city
police.
mr.
george
black
jr.
i
wouldn't
think
so.
people,
generally,
i
don't
know.
mr.
george
black
jr.
i
don't
find
it
any
different
than
if
the
owner
had
simply
asked
people
to
leave.
that's
all
that
happened.
they
asked
them
to
leave.
there
was
no
arrest
made,
they
were
just
asked
to
do
their
handbilling,
told
of
the
policy
of
the
company.
they
were
told
that
they
could
be
arrested
for
trespass,
they
were
told
that
and
there
was
some
testimony,
your
honor,
in
the
case
that
was
a
little
bit
different
than
the
stipulated
facts.
one
witness
testified
that
he
had
been
threatened
with
arrest
and
the
district
judge
considered
that
to
be
sufficient
state
action
in
order
to
justify
the
united
states
district
court
having
jurisdiction
under
the
civil
rights
statute
in
order
to
hear
the
case.
mr.
george
black
jr.
yes.
mr.
george
black
jr.
the
lloyd
corporation
selects
them
and
hires
them,
and
would
have
the
right
to
fire
them.
mr.
george
black
jr.
none
at
all,
absolutely
none.
mr.
george
black
jr.
mr.
black,
why
the
lloyd
hasn't
commissioned
by
the
city?
mr.
george
black
jr.
i
think
it's
a
matter
of
convenience,
there
is
shoplifting
in
the
place
of
that
character
and
the
other
disturbances
and
if
these
men
were
just
a
attendants
as
such,
they
wouldn't
have
the
--
at
least
they
demonstrated
in
the
apparent
power
to
cause
the
incident
to
be
taken
care
of.
mr.
george
black
jr.
so
they
did
have
apparent
powers
to
the
city
police?
mr.
george
black
jr.
well,
i
think
the
evidence
shows
is
that
they
had,
what
can
i
call
a
special
police
commission
authorizing
them,
but
they
didn't
exercise
it
in
this
case
other
than
to
explain
the
policy.
mr.
george
black
jr.
but
they
did
extensively
have
it?
one
man
thought
he
had
because
he
said
he
was
threatened
with
arrest.
mr.
george
black
jr.
well,
that's
--
but
anybody
could
threatened
anybody
for
arrest
as
such
you
don't
have
to
be
a
policeman.
mr.
george
black
jr.
well,
wouldn't
it
be
a
little
different
if
the
man
had
a
uniform
on?
mr.
george
black
jr.
pardon,
sir.
mr.
george
black
jr.
would
it
be
little
different,
man
in
a
uniform,
a
gun
and
a
--
mr.
george
black
jr.
yeah,
but
i
don't
know
if
they
had
a
gun,
and
a
lot
of
these
(inaudible).
mr.
george
black
jr.
this
is
a
large
place
and
it's
for
the
protection
of
the
public,
things
of
that
character.
we
pay
the
taxes
and
administer
the
entire
situation
of
the
city
as
such.
just
proceeding,
i
think
i
have
told
you
about
the
ninth
circuit
decided,
the
ninth
--
rather
the
district
court
failed
to
give
any
attention
to
our
contention
and
that
this
handbilling
had
no
relation
at
all
to
the
use
that
we
were
making
of
the
premises
and
also
that
i
got
--
mr.
george
black
jr.
there
were
some
--
mr.
george
black
jr.
once
every
four
years,
they
ask
them
to
come
in
order
to
bring
people
to
the
place,
and
that
was
the
extent,
all
other
political
speeches
and
talks
were
turned
down,
they
were
not
permitted.
it
was
generally
not
permitted.
and
if
that--
mr.
george
black
jr.
i
think
it's
all
irrelevant,
i
think
that
case
is
irrelevant,
just
like
i
think
that
that
veterans
--
mr.
george
black
jr.
well,
i
think
this,
mr.
justice
white,
i
don't
know
the
department
store
or
any
merchant
that
doesn't
put
on
some
kind
of
promotion
in
order
to
get
the
people
into
his
place,
and
there
was
promotions.
mr.
george
black
jr.
well,
but
we
want
to
attract
the
kind
of
people
we
think
are
going
to
be
customers
there
and
not
that,
i
don't
think
that's
possibly
any
crowd.
mr.
george
black
jr.
yes,
i
think
the
first
amendment
would
take
over
if
it
were
in
a
public
place
and
be
entirely
different
than
its
private
setup
i
think.
but
i
think
the
fact
that
operating
a
store
setup
with
your
various
tenants,
i
think
the
promotional
feature
is
completely
incompetent
and
really
competent
and
irrelevant
in
this
case.
mr.
george
black
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
george
black
jr.
no,
on
page
193?
mr.
george
black
jr.
yes
it
refers
to
the
--
like
the,
that
ordinance
and
the
one
that
was
the
ordinance
--
one
of
the
ordinances,
they
are
all
copied
there.
193
is
the
last
one
that's
on
page
193.
that's
the
one
where
the
city
certified
that
lloyd
had
completed
all
of
its
obligations
in
connection
to
the
exchange
of
properties.
mr.
george
black
jr.
no,
specific
ordinance
applicable
to
the
application
for
vacations,
thank
you.
