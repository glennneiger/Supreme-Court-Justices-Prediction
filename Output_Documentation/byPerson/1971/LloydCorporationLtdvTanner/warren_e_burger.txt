we

arguments
next
in

lloyd
corp.
against

mr.
black,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
the
public
streets
identifiable
in
any
way,
marked
in
any
way
that
we
see
them
on
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
pick
up
there
after
lunch.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
given
us
the
setting,
now
you
can
move
into
the
full
argument.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
black,
i
take
it
that
there
is
no
problem
of
littering
in
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
a
common
thing
in
portland
for
private
security
guards
to
be
commissioned?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
common
here
in
washington.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
national
park?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
a
misdemeanor
committed
in
the
presence
of
a
private
person
be
the
subject
of
a
citizen
arrest
in
oregon?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
does
this
add
anything
to
the
--
does
the
commission
add
anything
to
the
power
to
make
an
arrest
for
--?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
were
these
arrests
made
on
the
basis
of
offenses
committed
in
the
presence
of
the
security
guards?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
mean
with
the
removal,
the
efforts
to
remove
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
witnessed
the
acts.
that's
what
i
am
trying
to
get
at.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
it
equally
irrelevant?
if
it
is
a
public
place,
because
if
it's
a
public
place,
the
first
amendment
takes
over.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired
now,
mr.
black.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
black.
mr.
neil.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
they
couldn't
refuse
them
service,
could
they
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
under
the
holdings
of
this
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
doesn't
help
us
one
way
or
the
other.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
the
block
right
under
the
word
c
of
lloyd
center
on
the
map?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
letter
c?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
115
is
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
are
halsey
and
--
well
the
streets
bounding
at
halsey
and
multnomah
and
the
others,
are
they
public
streets?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
an
area
completely
surrounded
by
public
streets.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
as
this
building
is
surrounded
by
public
streets
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
your
view,
does
it
make
any
difference
to
the
case
whether
this
was
all
acquired
from
a
private
party
or
some
of
it
was
acquired
from
the
public
domain?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
legally
and
fundamentally
different
from
number
of
the
farms
in
the
united
states
that
derive
from
government
patents?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
this
property,
simply
by
deed
from
the
city
or
was
it
--
some
of
that
taking
by
eminent
domain.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
the
lloyd
acquired
it
from
the
property
owners?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
speaking
of
the
blocks,
the
blocks.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
much
do
you
rely
on
the
fact
that
these
men
--
these
security
officers
held
commissions
from
the
city
police?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
they
gave
them
the
same
uniforms
and
just
turned
in
there--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
then
it
isn’t
very
important,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
could
be
plain
clothes
or
guards
or
they
could
be
uniform
guards,
marked
private
security
lloyd
center
or
whatever?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
would
you
say
the
state
action,
suppose
someone
came
in
there,
assume
that
there
is
a
bank
there
and
some
bank
robbers
came
in
to
rob
the
bank
and
the
bank
charters
took
some
clubs
or
guns
and
resisted
the
robbery.
would
you
say
that’s
state
action?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
self-help,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
this
lloyd
center
has
a
staff
of
men
highly
trained
in
“self-help”.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it’d
be
very
easy,
wouldn’t
it?
for
them
to
convert,
if
the
case
were
to
turn
on
that
kind
of
a
point?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
look,
he
doesn’t
invoke
any
law,
he
just
grabs
him
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
and
throws
him
off,
he
doesn’t
identify
the
statute
or
the
common
law
that
he’s
acting
under.
he
just
says
this
is
my
property
off,
how
does
that--?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh
no,
i'm
just
--
i'm
trying
to
find
out
how
important
it
is
that
these
men
have
commissions
that
they
have
uniforms
or
whatever.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i'm
not
sure
what
i
thought
about
it,
i'm
just
trying
to
find
out
where
we’re
going?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes
but
if
the
same
private
guard
have
turned
in
his
badge
and
made
--
ejected
somebody
or
made
a
citizen's
arrest,
the
following
week
then
would
it--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
then
the
state
action
is
not
an
important
factor
in
here,
your
honor.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
your
suggestion
introduces
a
new
factor
when
you
said
free
speech,
which
they
don't
like.
laying
aside
whatever
this
record
shows
on
other
types
of
things
allowed,
suppose
they
said
all
political
demonstrations
start
out,
they
don't
want
people
for
the
war,
against
the
war
or
for
public
housing
or
against
the
public
housing,
so
that
there's
no
discrimination.
does
that
change
the
situation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
that
they
are
excluding
things
they
don't
like
either?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
does
the
right
to
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
the
swimming
pool
here
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
public

of
the

chief

isn't
there
is

chief

e.

skating

that's
right.
is
the
girl,
i
will
figure
skating
on
it,
yes,
is
that
the
functional
equivalent
to
the
public
counter
part?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what's
the
difference?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
will
they
do
in
some
public
--.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
am
trying
to
test
what
justice
rehnquist
was
driving
at.
i
would
be
perfectly
candid
in
saying,
i
don't
understand
the
concept.
functional
equivalence.
i
don't
see
any
boundaries
on
it.
chief

warren
e.

but
is
it
conceivable
that
some
people,
customers
i
am
speaking
of
now,
would
refrain
from
going
to
a
place
in
order
to
avoid
having
people
harass
them
with
pamphlets
and
leaflets?
chief
justice
warren
e.

in
the
recent
decisions
of
this

you
will
find
the
enforcement
of
such
statutes
is
not
as
easy
as
writing

them.
chief

warren
e.

i
was

some
of
the
cases

we
struck
down
city

because
of
the

i
am

you
