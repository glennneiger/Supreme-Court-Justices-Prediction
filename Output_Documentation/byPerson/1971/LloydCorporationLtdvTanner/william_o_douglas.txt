commissioned

i
see
on
page
146
of
the
reference
mr.
black,
that
there
are
a
number
of
conceptions
that
the
soliciting
or
handing
out
literature
or
picketing.
i
see
one
of
the
american
legion,
another
is
the
volunteers
of
america,
another
is
a
salvation
army
and
there
is
perhaps
one
other
thing,
but
anyway
there
are
few.

between
80
pages,
185
or
195,
there
is
the
state's
statement,
the
president
of
the
corporation,
he
was
asked
about
that,
and
he
said
that
he
felt
that;
that
was
a
charitable
feature,
that
was
engaged
them.
they
allowed
the
salvation
army
to
put
their
kettles
there
once
a
year
in
christmas.
they
allowed
the
veterans,
i
believe
to
sell
their
poppies
on
one
occasion.
there
were
two
or
three
things
of
that
kind
and
limited
to
that
of
a
charitable
character.
i
will
say
that
there
was
other
evidence
in
the
case
of
promotional
activities,
and
there
was
substantial
testimony
in
the
case
to
the
effect
of
the
promotional
activities,
rather
the
only
evidence
really
in
the
case
what
brought
it
was
that
the
promotional
activities
were
put
on,
on-purpose
for
the
purpose
of
bringing
people
there,
everything
from
an
illustrative
general
concert
to
an
antique
car,
and
things
like
that.
