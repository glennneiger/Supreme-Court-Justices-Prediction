justice
potter
stewart
well,
mr.
black
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
mr.
black,
it's
actually
though
an
extension
of
the
streets,
i
mean
the
walkways
and
terminals
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
--
people
getting
back
and
forth
from
one
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
they
cross
it
to
the
opposite,
to
the
street
in
the
opposite
side
there.
justice
potter
stewart
yeah.
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
vehicular
traffic
in
the
mall?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
vehicular
traffic?
justice
potter
stewart
but
there
is
a
great
deal
of
pedestrian
traffic.
justice
potter
stewart
everyone
who
patronizes,
one
of
these
shops
of
the
skating
rink
and
so
forth
--
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
sure
to
say,
where
the
picketing,
where
the
leaf-letting
occurred
on
pages
134
and
135
in
front
of
the
meier
and
frank
company.
now
where
can
we
find
that
on
plaintiff's
exhibit
number
3
on
page
115?
justice
potter
stewart
where
in
this
on
page
115,
where
in
this
area
we
are
looking
--?
justice
potter
stewart
i've
got
lloyd
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
center.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
but
doesn't
that
fact
alone
make
the
lloyds
(inaudible)
to
the
city
or
the
city
--
isn't
that
fact
alone
that
the
city
is
participating
in
whatever
lloyd's
--
whatever
instructions
lloyd's
have
placed
on
the
premise?
justice
potter
stewart
did
the
court
say
so
in
a
case
involving
an
amusement
park
just
outside
of
washington,
three
years
ago?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
was
a
situation
in
which
the
private
owner
of
the
park
used
local
police
--
justice
potter
stewart
an
incidence
happened
which
the
court
held
constituted
state
action?
justice
potter
stewart
you
have
security
guards
under
this
city
commission
arrest
for
violations
of
that
kind
on
the
property?
justice
potter
stewart
do
they
do
so
--
do
they
have
the
power
and
authority
to
do
so?
justice
potter
stewart
do
they
have
the
authority
to
do
so
under
the
commission
from
the
city?
justice
potter
stewart
yeah.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
--
justice
potter
stewart
page
120
indicates
they
do
have
specific
authority,
plaintiffs
exhibit
number
8.
justice
potter
stewart
misdemeanors
committed
in
the
presence
also
arrest
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
i
take
it
that
private
citizen
can't
do
what
second
paragraph
says
here,
an
officer
has
every
reason
to
believe
that
suspect
participated
in
a
felony,
even
though
it's
out
of
his
presence
to
arrest
this
proper
private
citizen
can
do
that,
could
he?
justice
potter
stewart
and
did
their
handbilling
on
the
public
streets.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
the
record
shows
on
page
142.
we
have
a
sliver
badge
where
the
city
is
gold.
the
buttons
on
our
uniform
are
all
silver
where
the
city
police
are
all
gold.
the
city
has
a
2-inch
stripe
down
the
breeches,
and
we
don't
have.
it's
all
in
the
record.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
record
indicates
it
on
page
140.
justice
potter
stewart
suppose
that
the
fact
that
officers
were
deputized
agents
of
the
state
would
have
something
to
do
perhaps
for
the
purposes
of
1983
jurisdiction.
but
since
there
was
no
arrest
here,
i
would
suppose
you're
simply
relying
on
a
doctrine
of
marsh
against
alabama
and
logan
valley.
justice
potter
stewart
that
this
complex
was--
justice
potter
stewart
--
government
itself.
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
no
such
thing
as
trespassing
on
public
sidewalks.
justice
potter
stewart
in
marsh
v.
alabama,
they
were
to
hold
this
witnesses
and
i
don't
know
how
related
that
was
to?
justice
potter
stewart
business
of
that
company
town.
unrelated
i
should
say
under
the
logan
valley.
