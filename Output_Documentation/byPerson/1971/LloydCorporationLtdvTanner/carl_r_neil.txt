mr.
carl
r.
neil
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
suppose
i
could
begin
preciously
by
saying
that
mr.
black
says
the
purpose
of
building
shopping
center
was
to
get
people
to
come
and
buy
things
and
it
succeeded.
these
plaintiffs
did
buy
something.
when
told
to
leave
the
premises,
they
said
where
can
we
eat,
and
a
nice
security
guard
sat
down
at
mannings
right
in
the
shopping
center
and
they
went
there
and
purchased
food,
but
--
mr.
carl
r.
neil
no,
of
course
not.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
no,
of
course,
not
your
honor,
and
i
don't
suggest
that
it's
--
mr.
carl
r.
neil
no,
it
does
not.
i
think,
your
honor,
few
of
the
questions
of
court
though,
that
it
is
worthwhile
spending
some
additional
time
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
it
does
involve
a
large
urban
shopping
center
and
i
think
i
can
perhaps
assist
the
court
in
getting
the
relationship
of
the
city
and--
mr.
carl
r.
neil
if
there
is
within
the
shopping
center,
i'm
not
aware
of
it.
your
honor,
the
record
doesn't
show.
the
court
would
look
at
exhibit
3
on
page
115
of
the
appendix,
again,
this
map.
i
think
you
can
relate
it
to
the
aerial
photographs
which
appear
on
following
two
pages.
you
will
note
on
exhibit
3,
this
main
18
square
block
or
formally
18
square
blocks
area,
which
we
call
the
main
part
of
lloyd
center,
where
the
picketing
or
the
handbilling
took
place,
and
you
look
on
your
next
page
in
the
aerial
photograph
and
that's
the
same
area
that's
shown
right
in
the
center,
same
18
block
area
to
get
an
idea
of
the
structure
that's
situated
on
the
18
block.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
it's
right
under
the
word
--
mr.
carl
r.
neil
the
letter
n.
you're
talking
about
the
map
at
page
115,
your
honor?
mr.
carl
r.
neil
yeah,
it's
bounded
by
halsey
street
on
the
north,
multnomah
on
the
south,
9th
and
15th
streets
on
the
east
and
west.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
yes
they
are,
your
honor,
and
as
i
say--
mr.
carl
r.
neil
yes,
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
yes.
you
can
see
the
same
18
block
area
on
aerial
photograph
of
the
following
page
exhibit
4,
right
in
the
center
portion
of
the
photograph.
the
building
does
have
several
levels,
or
at
least
more
than
one
level
since
the
land
is
sloping
somewhat
and
that
photograph
does
not
show
it.
the
following
photograph
exhibit
5
on
page
117.
if
we
refer
back
to
the
map,
that
photograph
is
looking
from
the
upper
right-hand
corner
of
the
map
to
the
lower
left-hand
corner.
in
other
words
looking
toward
the
west
side
of
the
city
of
portland
in
the
background,
you
can
see
the
main
downtown
district
down
the
west
side
of
willamette
river
in
this
photograph.
so
this
city
is
bisected
by
the
willamette
river.
its
main
downtown
business
area
is
on
the
west
side
of
the
river.
this
shopping
center
is
situated
on
the
east
side
of
the
river
and
what
is
another
commercial
district
of
the
city.
now,
this
main
part
of
the
shopping
center,
this
former
18
square
block
area,
is
as
the
evidence
shows,
the
portion
of
the
shopping
center
which
gets
the
main
traffic,
both
in
terms
of
pedestrian
traffic,
in
terms
of
automobile
parking,
and
this
sort
of
thing.
there
are
other
portions
of
the
shopping
center,
but
this
is
the
main
portion
of
it
where
the
handbilling
took
place.
this
main
portion
as
well
as
some
of
the
other
portions
were
made
possible
by
the
city
vacating
and
conveying
to
lloyd
corporation.
about
8.838
acres
of
former
public
streets
and
sidewalks,
and
those,
of
course,
again,
are
shown
on
the
map
at
115
of
the
appendix,
you
can
see
the
dotted
lines
on
that
map
that
indicate
the
former
city
streets.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
well,
it
might
make
some
difference
your
honor,
because
here
we
have
government
assisting
in
the
creation
of
a
private
shopping
center
in
a
way
that
probably
wouldn't
have
been
possible
to
create
the
shopping
center,
but
for
the
vacation
of
the
street.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
well,
in
sense
of
all
title
derives
from
the
government,
no
it
is
not
different.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
the
street
and
sidewalk
property,
that
the
city
conveyed
was
all
city
public
property,
simply
i
don't
know
if
they
had
it
be,
they
at
least
vacated
it.
the
law
may
automatically
say,
the
adjoining
property
owner
gets
the
property
in
the
case
of
vacation,
and
they
were,
of
course,
the
adjoining
property
on
the
both
sides
of
street.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
no,
they
acquired
the
streets
inside
your
honor.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
oh
yes,
the
property,
former
private
property
was
indeed
acquired
from
those
people.
as
i
say,
this
main
area
is
about
8.83
acres,
former
streets
and
sidewalks,
the
traffic
center
has
within
it
as
mr.
black
mentioned,
a
skating
rink
which
is
open
to
the
public,
it
has
a
public
auditorium,
which
the
evidence
shows
is
sometimes
rented
out
by
lloyd
corporation
and
is
sometimes
donated
to
use.
as
the
district
court
found
below,
the
malls
and
walkways
within
the
shopping
center
are
open
to
the
public
at
all
times,
those
malls,
the
principal
malls
run
north
and
south
and
east
and
west,
and
they
are
about
50
feet
wide
in
some
of
the
photographs,
the
plaintiff's
exhibit
11,
and
some
of
the
photographs
offered
by
the
other
side,
also
in
the
appendix
show
and
these
broad
malls
and
walkways
within
the
shopping
center.
the
interior
parking
on
this
main
park
of
the
shopping
center
affords
parking
for
not
less
than
1000
automobiles,
about
850,000
square
feet
so
the
record
shows.
there's
also
evidence
in
the
record
that
additional
parking
on
lloyd
center
property
is
available
elsewhere
in
the
shopping
center,
but
in
this
area
about
a
1000
cars.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
well,
first
of
all,
your
honor,
they
park
throughout
this
main
part.
it's
a
multi-level
structure.
you
can
see
some
of
the
parking
on
the
following
page
in
the
aerial
photograph.
that
is
the
upper
level
parking
you
can
see.
in
addition
to
that,
there
is
also
a
lower
level
of
parking,
which
you
cannot
see
on
this
photograph,
that
underlines
so
far
as
i
know,
the
entire18
block
area
except
for
the
skating
rink,
i
think,
which
goes
down
into
the
ground
further.
so
there
is
underground
parking,
under
this
entire
18
block
area,
substantially,
in
additional
to
parking
you
see
on
the
upper
level
on
exhibit
4.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
i
didn't
quite
understand
your
question,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
i
see.
no,
in
general,
no.
although,
if
you
look
at
some
of
the
photographs,
plaintiff's
exhibit
11
on
page
131,
for
example,
there
are
two
photographs
on
the
page.
if
you
look
at
the
bottom
page
photograph
and
also
the
upper
one,
you
can
see
that
there
are
pedestrian
walkways,
right,
adjacent
to
parking
and
vehicle
movement
area.
this
is
the
upper
level,
one
of
the
upper
level
parking
lots,
shown
in
both
of
these
photographs.
so
in
some
cases,
you
do
have
sidewalks
adjacent
to
the
parking
areas
and
the
underground
area,
you
have
great,
vast
parking
lots
that
probably
are
not
--
do
not
have
sidewalks
going
through
them.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
no,
the
record
doesn't
explain
that,
but
since
i've
been
here
a
few
times
when
that
kind
of
thing
was
there,
i
think
it's
a
display
your
honor,
it
can't
be
automobiles.
as
one
of
the
questions
indicated,
the
lloyd
corporation
has
permitted
a
variety
of
outside
activities
to
take
place,
non-profit
activities
on
its
malls
and
walkways
of
its
shopping
center.
some
of
these
involve
great
crowds
of
people,
such
as
football
rallies,
political
rallies
for
presidential
candidates,
various
kinds
of
displays,
musical
performances,
there
is
evidence
that
they
once
had
a
crowd
of
20,000
people
there
in
the
shopping
center
for
an
(inaudible)
concert.
someway
the
auditorium
is
used
as
i
mentioned
before
on
a
non-rental
basis,
with
the
lloyd
center’s
corporation's
permission,
by
some
groups,
cancer
society,
campfire
girls,
girl
scouts,
but
it
rents
out
on
charged
basis
to
other
groups.
in
any
event,
there
are
large
number
of
outside
people
coming
to
the
shopping
center
to
use
that
auditorium
or
participate
in
some
activity
taking
place
there.
they
have
also
permitted
a
number
of
charitable,
frankly,
charitable
solicitations
which
the
court
below
found,
were
not
put
on
to
induce
customer
motivation,
but
were
put
on
because
the
lloyd
center
thought
they
were
worthwhile
charities,
such
as
the
salvation
army,
the
volunteers
of
america,
the
american
legion
selling
buddy
poppies
and
the
like,
other
groups,
similarly
considering
themselves
charities,
very
few
such
permissions
such
as
the
record
shows,
the
march
of
dimes
and
hidatsa.
now,
coming
to
the
incident
question,
the
police
officers
are
employees
of
the
corporation
and
they
do
hold
that
commissions
where
a
copy
of
which
is
an
evidence,
vesting
them
with
full
police
authority.
that
comes
out
of
the
commission.
i
have
no
doubt
that
these
police
officers
have
the
same
authority
as
a
regular
policeman
does
in
the
city
of
portland.
i
also
have,
i
think
it
is
clear
in
the
record,
that
these
policemen
as
the
district
court
found,
caused
the
plaintiff
to
believe
that
they
would
be
arrested
for
trespass.
if
they
did
not
cease
and
desist,
from
their
handbilling
and
go
out
to
the
exterior
public
sidewalks,
which
they
did,
in
order
to
avoid
arrest.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
no,
you
are
talking
about
the
single
store
inside
the
business
premises
where
the
business
is--
mr.
carl
r.
neil
is
that
right?
no
that's
not
within
the
logan
valley
rule--
mr.
carl
r.
neil
i'm
not
sure
it
adds
anything
to
my
case
except
the
court’s
questions
indicated
i
guess
what
is
the
basis
for
color
of
law
under
section
1983
under
which
this
case
arose,
and
one
basis
you
could
answer
is
the
presence
of
deputy
police
officers
threatening
people
with
arrest
unless
they
abandoned
what
they
considered
to
be
their
constitutional
rights.
that
i
think
is
the
relevance
of
that
evidence
probably.
so
they
left
to
avoid
arrest.
they
were
distributing
leaflets,
the
evidence
shows
no
more
than
five
people
throughout
this
20
or
25
acre
main
part
of
lloyd
center,
different
places,
i
think
two
of
them
were
somewhere
near
each
other
in
the
meier
&
frank
entrance,
which
counsel
pointed
to
in
the
photograph.
the
rest
of
them
were
in
different
places
throughout
this
large
area.
there
is
no
evidence
whatever,
in
fact,
the
findings
and
the
evidence
are
sort
of
contrary
of
any
violence,
any
disturbance,
any
upset,
even
the
reaction,
evidence
is
very,
very
slim.
one
lady
asked
the
shopping
center
manager,
what's
going
on
here?
and
he
told
her
and
she
said,
well,
i
don't
like
those
views.
then
the
lady
told
one
of
the
leafleters
to
drop
dead
and
a
third
lady,
said
stop
bothering
him.
so,
that
is
much
public
reaction,
i
think,
for
the
nature
of
the
activity
which
was
going
on
here.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
the
evidence
shows
there
was
no
littering
your
honor.
mr.
black's
response
was
that
littering
is
a
concern
of
the
lloyd
corporation
and
they
argue
in
their
brief,
of
course
that
if
the
rule
we
contend
for
as
a
law
they
will
have
littering
expense,
expense
to
clean
up
litter.
well,
they
also
have
expense
to
clean
up
litter
when
there
are
football
rallies
a
lot
more.
they
have
expense
to
clean
up
litter
if
no
distribution
takes
place
to
public
and
passing
through
these
walkways
obviously
is
going
to
drop
some
candy
wrappers.
and
i
am
not
--
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record,
and
that
shows
the
cost
of
cleanup,
whatever
litter
might
result
from
handbilling
is
any
greater
than
the
cost
of
cleaning
up
candy
wrappers
and
like
it
will
be
dropped
by
the
public,
in
any
event.
now,
i
think
it's
important
to
emphasize
in
addition
to
what
this
case
is
about,
what
it
is
not
about.
it
does
not
involve
disturbance,
upset,
picketing
obstruction
of
a
normal
use
of
the
properties
such
as
was
present
in
adderley
versus
florida,
cox
versus
louisiana
or
cameron
versus
johnson.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
it
has
one
basis
for
showing
color
of
law
under
section
1983.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
i
would
argue
the
result
should
not
be
different.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
i
don't
believe
it
is
in
this
case
your
honor.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
well,
i
take
mr.
black’s
example
that
he
personally
kicks
them
out
if
he
is
the
president
of
the
corporation.
he
would
do
so,
undoubtedly,
under
the
trespass
laws
of
the
city
or
the
state.
now
that
seems
to
me
to
invoke
this
court’s
decision
in
adickes
v.
sh
kress.
private
party
making
use
of
the
public
statutes
to
enforce
his
policies,
in
this
case,
against
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
no
i'd
say
that's
self-defense.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
self-help.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
well,
i
can
conceive
that
happening,
but
it
seems--
mr.
carl
r.
neil
yes,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
wherever
that
occurs,
that
party
is
likely
to
invoke
the
trespass
laws
too.
he
probably--
mr.
carl
r.
neil
well,
i
suppose
he
can
do
that,
if
you’re
asking
me,
if
that
is
permissible,
does
that
change?
mr.
carl
r.
neil
it
is
something
you
can
hang
your
hat
on,
but
i
don't
think
it’s
that
important.
i
agree
with
you
your
honor.
i
have
even
broader--
mr.
carl
r.
neil
i
have
an
even
broader
ground
for
--
mr.
carl
r.
neil
i
agree
with
that
your
honor.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
that
might
not
be
the
state
action.
but
my
next
argument
would
be
that,
that
doesn't
necessarily
change
the
result
that
should
occur
in
this
case.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
yes,
it
is,
it
is
an
important
factor
but
that
isn't
the
only
thing
that
may
create
state
actions
in
this
case.
for
example--
mr.
carl
r.
neil
exactly.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
yeah,
that's
quite--
mr.
carl
r.
neil
--about--
mr.
carl
r.
neil
right.
that's
exactly
the
rationale
of
diamond
versus
bland
in
the
california
supreme
court,
where
they
say
once
you've
found
functional
equivalency
of
the
private
property
in
question
to
the
sidewalks
of
a
public
business
district,
you
have
answered
the
state
action
question
right
there.
that
is
the
rationale
of
diamond
versus
bland
i
think
is
probably
a
similar
kind
of
rationale
of
burton
versus
wilmington
parking
authority
where
you
had
the
lease
of
public
property
to
a
private
authority.
that
in
effect
you
had
a
functional
equivalent
of
the
public
parking
thing
being
operated
now
by
a
private
party.
and
once
you
reach
that,
you've
got
state
action.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
well,
the
difference,
your
honor,
is
that
the
property
initially
was
owned
by
a
public
body
in
wilmington
and
it
was
not
initially
owned,
all
of
it
at
least
by
a
public
body
in
either
logan
valley
or
this
case
as
i
mentioned.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
well,
yes
i
think
it
might
have.
for
example,
suppose
it
was
impossible
to
build
that
type
of
parking
structure
in
burton
case
without
that
happening
for
some
reason
or
another.
that's
what
i
contend
is
a
case
here.
you
could
not
build
this
type
of
shopping
center
without
vacating
public
streets
and
sidewalks.
there
had
to
be
state
aid,
state
participation
by
conveying
property
of
lloyd
corporation
here
in
order
to
permit
this
kind
of
shopping
center
to
be
built.
it
is
more
than
just
granting
them
a
zone
chain
or
something
of
that
sort.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
the
record
doesn't
show
that,
your
honor,
but
i
think
it
probably
does.
the
record
does
show
that
the
ordinance
vacating
streets
expressly
recited
that
it
was
to
permit
the
creation
of
a
general
retail
business
district
by
lloyd
corporation.
and
i
started
to
talk
about
things
this
case
doesn't
involve,
another
thing
that
it
doesn't
involve
is,
it
doesn't
involve
regulation,
any
question
in
my
opinion
of
reasonable
regulation.
it's
a
question
of
whether
the
lloyd
corporation
may
flatly
and
completely,
totally
prohibit
free
speech
or
any
kind
of
free
speech
that
it
doesn't
approve,
it
doesn't
like,
on
its
own
interior
malls
and
walkways
when
they
are
as
the
district
court
found
the
functional
equivalence
of
public
sidewalks
in
a
public
business
district.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
no,
i
don't
think
it
does
your
honor.
i
think--
mr.
carl
r.
neil
well,
i
think
it
doesn't
result,
your
honor,
because
one
of
the
things
i
am
arguing
is
that
if
the
rule
the
lloyd
corporation
seeks
is
adopted
here,
the
result
is
not
just
total
prohibition,
result
as
the
american
retail
federation
amicus
brief
clearly
says,
is
the
right
to
choose
which
speech,
which
activity,
which
non-commercial
enterprise
will
take
place
on
these
malls
and
walkways
and
not
merely
the
right
to
say
that
none
shall.
so
while
it
isn't
and
essential
to
my
position
and
i
think
that
it
is
a
result
will
occur
if
my
position
is
not
adopted.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
yes.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
yes,
i
agree,
mr.
justice
marshall
has
expressed
statement
that
he
is
not
commenting,
the
court
is
commenting
on
“unrelated
speech.”
mr.
carl
r.
neil
well
i
suppose,
we
get
an
argument
about
what
is
related
and
un-related.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
that's
true,
it's
not
related
in
a
sense
that
it
has
anything
particularly
to
do
with
any
tenant
of
the
shopping
center.
but
let's
examine
that
for
a
moment.
suppose
we
had
written
on
our
invitations
or
the
literature
handed
out
here,
to
the
employees
of
meier
&
frank,
please
join
us
tonight
at
the
church
for
a
potluck
supper
and
help
us
express
our
opposition
to
war
in
vietnam,
is
that
related
now?
do
the
leafletters
have
in
their
power
to
determine
what
is
related
and
unrelated
by
doing
something
like
that?
mr.
carl
r.
neil
yes
sir.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
well,
i
think
that
once
you
get
over
the
functional
equivalence
point
that
we
are
then
just
talking
about
reasonable
regulation
and
rather
than
prohibition.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
unrelated.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
yes,
but
notice
how
much
we've
jumped
on
it
when
we
have
said
functionally
equivalent,
we
ruled
out
all
kinds
of
premises,
we
ruled
out
hotel
apartment
lobbies,
private
residences,
interiors
of
businesses,
and
industrial
plants
for
the
most
part.
we
are
down
to
a
pretty
now
--
.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
hardware
stores,
interiors
of
hardware
stores
at
least.
i
don't
know
enough
about
the
factual
record
in
the
central
hardware
case
to
comment
on
how
appropriate
or
how
close
the
factual
situation
that
is.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
it
seems
to
me,
first
of
all
we
don't
stop
at
functional
equivalent,
functional
equivalent
of
a
public
sidewalk
in
a
public
business
district,
so
let's
go
back,
of
the
business
district.
lloyd
center
i
would
say
is
a
business
district,
in
the
same
sense
of
the
company
town
in
marsh
versus
alabama,
it's
the
business
district
or
logan
valley
plaza
was
a
business
district.
secondly,
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
public
sidewalk
in
such
a
district,
clearly
these
pedestrian
malls
and
walkway
serve
the
same
function
of
carrying
pedestrians
between
businesses
that
a
public
sidewalk
does,
and
what's
more
the
activities
that
took
place
on
them
are
much
akin
to
the
activities
that
might
take
place
on
public
sidewalk.
perhaps
they
are
even
greater,
because
they
are
broader,
and
they
can
accommodate
things
like
automobile
displays
where
as
a
public
sidewalk
could
not.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
yes,
i
do
your
honor.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
that's
true.
the
logan
valley
case
says,
your
opinion
points
out
--
mr.
carl
r.
neil
no,
in
this
case?
mr.
carl
r.
neil
no
your
honor,
we
could
not.
a
large
number
of
people,
and
the
exact
number
not
shown
by
the
record,
arised
and
leaved
solely
by
automobile.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
yes,
they
do
your
honor.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
pardon
me.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
well
i
think
that
would
be
very
difficult.
here's
automobiles
--
mr.
carl
r.
neil
right.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
well
maybe
it
is,
because
i
think
it's
so
difficult
that
there
actually
are
hazards
to
the
safety
of
person
if
you
are
trying
to
do
it,
and
is
ineffective
secondly,
because
you
can't
really
handle
leaflet
to
a
driver
removing
automobile.
let's
say,
standing
on
the
other
side.
well,
if
i
were
a
driver
leaving
--
mr.
carl
r.
neil
the
numbers
are
not
shown
as
to
how
many
come
by
bus
--
mr.
carl
r.
neil
well,
the
only
people
that
are
going
to
walk
on
that
sidewalk
are
people
who
do
not
enter
and
leave
from
the
shopping
center
by
automobile.
therefore,
they
arrive
by
bus
or
on
foot.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
the
record
doesn't
show.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
are
you
speaking
of
skating
rink,
are
you?
mr.
carl
r.
neil
skating
rink.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
they
charged
admission
from
one
thing
to
this
thing.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
yes,
and
i
suppose
you
put
it
to
me,
what
if
i
were
to
exclude
people
on
the
basis
of
race,
or
religion
or
something
of
that
sort
and
i
might
be
able
to
argue
that
it
was,
but
i
don't
think
it's
crucial
to
whether
the
malls
and
walkways
are
functional
equivalents
of
sidewalks.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
well
first
of
all,
i
limit
it
to
the
business
districts,
secondly
i
limit
it
to
the
functional
equivalence
of
sidewalks,
in
the
sense
that
sidewalks,
they
are
using
--
they
are
being
used
to
carry
pedestrian
traffic
between
businesses
within
the
business
district
and
i
think
that
you
have
then
got
to
the
functional
equivalent
provided
that
couple
of
other
conditions
don't
exist,
like
in
taggart
v.
weinacker,
is
apparently
a
sidewalk
there
was
so
narrow
that
any
exercise
of
first
amendment
speech
or
whatever
would
have
unreasonably
interfered
with
the
owner's
use
of
the
property
normally.
i
can
concede
that,
in
that
situation,
the
property
right
balance
is
greater
than
the
right
of
free
speech.
similarly,
if
the
physical
conditions
are
such
that
i
can
distribute
my
leaflet
to
to
everyone,
justice
marshall
was
talking
about,
that
are
going
to
be
on
a
sidewalk
and
i
can
distribute
it
to
everyone
of
them.
then
there
is
no
need
for
me
go
a
private
property
to
accomplish.
i
can
do
it
just
as
easily
on
that
public
sidewalk
but
i
think
this
record
shows
that
there
are
a
substantial
number
of
people,
that
are
not
going
to
be
reached
by
distributing
on
the
public
sidewalk,
around
the
shopping
center.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
well,
yes
it
is
conceivable.
it
is
also
conceivable
to
me
that
lloyd
corporation
or
the
city
of
portland,
may
adopt
regulations
that
prevent
people
from
handing
out
leaflets
in
any
manner
that
harasses
these
people,
so
that
you
must
do
it
if
you
do
it
at
all
peacefully.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
in
what
sense,
i
don't
follow
it.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
that's
true.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
well,
i
agree
that
in
first
amendment
cases,
even
on
public
sidewalks
that
there
are
difficulties
of
regulation.
this
court
has
had
many
cases
like
cox
v.
new
hampshire,
schneider
v.
state,
all
of
this
line
of
cases
where
you
have
got
permits
and
the
question
is,
is
the
permit
valid
or
the
statute
valid
because
it's
too
broad
or
too
vague,
are
difficulties
in
regulating
anything
relating
to
first
amendment,
speech
and
activity.
but
we
do
it
in
the
case
of
public
sidewalks.
it
seems
to
me
it
can
be
done
in
a
case
of
the
functional
equivalence
of
public
sidewalks,
will
happen
to
be
on
private
property.
thank
you.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
suppose
i
could
begin
preciously
by
saying
that
mr.
black
says
the
purpose
of
building
shopping
center
was
to
get
people
to
come
and
buy
things
and
it
succeeded.
these
plaintiffs
did
buy
something.
when
told
to
leave
the
premises,
they
said
where
can
we
eat,
and
a
nice
security
guard
sat
down
at
mannings
right
in
the
shopping
center
and
they
went
there
and
purchased
food,
but
--
mr.
carl
r.
neil
no,
of
course
not.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
no,
of
course,
not
your
honor,
and
i
don't
suggest
that
it's
--
mr.
carl
r.
neil
no,
it
does
not.
i
think,
your
honor,
few
of
the
questions
of
court
though,
that
it
is
worthwhile
spending
some
additional
time
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
it
does
involve
a
large
urban
shopping
center
and
i
think
i
can
perhaps
assist
the
court
in
getting
the
relationship
of
the
city
and--
mr.
carl
r.
neil
if
there
is
within
the
shopping
center,
i'm
not
aware
of
it.
your
honor,
the
record
doesn't
show.
the
court
would
look
at
exhibit
3
on
page
115
of
the
appendix,
again,
this
map.
i
think
you
can
relate
it
to
the
aerial
photographs
which
appear
on
following
two
pages.
you
will
note
on
exhibit
3,
this
main
18
square
block
or
formally
18
square
blocks
area,
which
we
call
the
main
part
of
lloyd
center,
where
the
picketing
or
the
handbilling
took
place,
and
you
look
on
your
next
page
in
the
aerial
photograph
and
that's
the
same
area
that's
shown
right
in
the
center,
same
18
block
area
to
get
an
idea
of
the
structure
that's
situated
on
the
18
block.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
it's
right
under
the
word
--
mr.
carl
r.
neil
the
letter
n.
you're
talking
about
the
map
at
page
115,
your
honor?
mr.
carl
r.
neil
yeah,
it's
bounded
by
halsey
street
on
the
north,
multnomah
on
the
south,
9th
and
15th
streets
on
the
east
and
west.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
yes
they
are,
your
honor,
and
as
i
say--
mr.
carl
r.
neil
yes,
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
yes.
you
can
see
the
same
18
block
area
on
aerial
photograph
of
the
following
page
exhibit
4,
right
in
the
center
portion
of
the
photograph.
the
building
does
have
several
levels,
or
at
least
more
than
one
level
since
the
land
is
sloping
somewhat
and
that
photograph
does
not
show
it.
the
following
photograph
exhibit
5
on
page
117.
if
we
refer
back
to
the
map,
that
photograph
is
looking
from
the
upper
right-hand
corner
of
the
map
to
the
lower
left-hand
corner.
in
other
words
looking
toward
the
west
side
of
the
city
of
portland
in
the
background,
you
can
see
the
main
downtown
district
down
the
west
side
of
willamette
river
in
this
photograph.
so
this
city
is
bisected
by
the
willamette
river.
its
main
downtown
business
area
is
on
the
west
side
of
the
river.
this
shopping
center
is
situated
on
the
east
side
of
the
river
and
what
is
another
commercial
district
of
the
city.
now,
this
main
part
of
the
shopping
center,
this
former
18
square
block
area,
is
as
the
evidence
shows,
the
portion
of
the
shopping
center
which
gets
the
main
traffic,
both
in
terms
of
pedestrian
traffic,
in
terms
of
automobile
parking,
and
this
sort
of
thing.
there
are
other
portions
of
the
shopping
center,
but
this
is
the
main
portion
of
it
where
the
handbilling
took
place.
this
main
portion
as
well
as
some
of
the
other
portions
were
made
possible
by
the
city
vacating
and
conveying
to
lloyd
corporation.
about
8.838
acres
of
former
public
streets
and
sidewalks,
and
those,
of
course,
again,
are
shown
on
the
map
at
115
of
the
appendix,
you
can
see
the
dotted
lines
on
that
map
that
indicate
the
former
city
streets.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
well,
it
might
make
some
difference
your
honor,
because
here
we
have
government
assisting
in
the
creation
of
a
private
shopping
center
in
a
way
that
probably
wouldn't
have
been
possible
to
create
the
shopping
center,
but
for
the
vacation
of
the
street.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
well,
in
sense
of
all
title
derives
from
the
government,
no
it
is
not
different.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
the
street
and
sidewalk
property,
that
the
city
conveyed
was
all
city
public
property,
simply
i
don't
know
if
they
had
it
be,
they
at
least
vacated
it.
the
law
may
automatically
say,
the
adjoining
property
owner
gets
the
property
in
the
case
of
vacation,
and
they
were,
of
course,
the
adjoining
property
on
the
both
sides
of
street.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
no,
they
acquired
the
streets
inside
your
honor.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
oh
yes,
the
property,
former
private
property
was
indeed
acquired
from
those
people.
as
i
say,
this
main
area
is
about
8.83
acres,
former
streets
and
sidewalks,
the
traffic
center
has
within
it
as
mr.
black
mentioned,
a
skating
rink
which
is
open
to
the
public,
it
has
a
public
auditorium,
which
the
evidence
shows
is
sometimes
rented
out
by
lloyd
corporation
and
is
sometimes
donated
to
use.
as
the
district
court
found
below,
the
malls
and
walkways
within
the
shopping
center
are
open
to
the
public
at
all
times,
those
malls,
the
principal
malls
run
north
and
south
and
east
and
west,
and
they
are
about
50
feet
wide
in
some
of
the
photographs,
the
plaintiff's
exhibit
11,
and
some
of
the
photographs
offered
by
the
other
side,
also
in
the
appendix
show
and
these
broad
malls
and
walkways
within
the
shopping
center.
the
interior
parking
on
this
main
park
of
the
shopping
center
affords
parking
for
not
less
than
1000
automobiles,
about
850,000
square
feet
so
the
record
shows.
there's
also
evidence
in
the
record
that
additional
parking
on
lloyd
center
property
is
available
elsewhere
in
the
shopping
center,
but
in
this
area
about
a
1000
cars.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
well,
first
of
all,
your
honor,
they
park
throughout
this
main
part.
it's
a
multi-level
structure.
you
can
see
some
of
the
parking
on
the
following
page
in
the
aerial
photograph.
that
is
the
upper
level
parking
you
can
see.
in
addition
to
that,
there
is
also
a
lower
level
of
parking,
which
you
cannot
see
on
this
photograph,
that
underlines
so
far
as
i
know,
the
entire18
block
area
except
for
the
skating
rink,
i
think,
which
goes
down
into
the
ground
further.
so
there
is
underground
parking,
under
this
entire
18
block
area,
substantially,
in
additional
to
parking
you
see
on
the
upper
level
on
exhibit
4.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
i
didn't
quite
understand
your
question,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
i
see.
no,
in
general,
no.
although,
if
you
look
at
some
of
the
photographs,
plaintiff's
exhibit
11
on
page
131,
for
example,
there
are
two
photographs
on
the
page.
if
you
look
at
the
bottom
page
photograph
and
also
the
upper
one,
you
can
see
that
there
are
pedestrian
walkways,
right,
adjacent
to
parking
and
vehicle
movement
area.
this
is
the
upper
level,
one
of
the
upper
level
parking
lots,
shown
in
both
of
these
photographs.
so
in
some
cases,
you
do
have
sidewalks
adjacent
to
the
parking
areas
and
the
underground
area,
you
have
great,
vast
parking
lots
that
probably
are
not
--
do
not
have
sidewalks
going
through
them.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
no,
the
record
doesn't
explain
that,
but
since
i've
been
here
a
few
times
when
that
kind
of
thing
was
there,
i
think
it's
a
display
your
honor,
it
can't
be
automobiles.
as
one
of
the
questions
indicated,
the
lloyd
corporation
has
permitted
a
variety
of
outside
activities
to
take
place,
non-profit
activities
on
its
malls
and
walkways
of
its
shopping
center.
some
of
these
involve
great
crowds
of
people,
such
as
football
rallies,
political
rallies
for
presidential
candidates,
various
kinds
of
displays,
musical
performances,
there
is
evidence
that
they
once
had
a
crowd
of
20,000
people
there
in
the
shopping
center
for
an
(inaudible)
concert.
someway
the
auditorium
is
used
as
i
mentioned
before
on
a
non-rental
basis,
with
the
lloyd
center’s
corporation's
permission,
by
some
groups,
cancer
society,
campfire
girls,
girl
scouts,
but
it
rents
out
on
charged
basis
to
other
groups.
in
any
event,
there
are
large
number
of
outside
people
coming
to
the
shopping
center
to
use
that
auditorium
or
participate
in
some
activity
taking
place
there.
they
have
also
permitted
a
number
of
charitable,
frankly,
charitable
solicitations
which
the
court
below
found,
were
not
put
on
to
induce
customer
motivation,
but
were
put
on
because
the
lloyd
center
thought
they
were
worthwhile
charities,
such
as
the
salvation
army,
the
volunteers
of
america,
the
american
legion
selling
buddy
poppies
and
the
like,
other
groups,
similarly
considering
themselves
charities,
very
few
such
permissions
such
as
the
record
shows,
the
march
of
dimes
and
hidatsa.
now,
coming
to
the
incident
question,
the
police
officers
are
employees
of
the
corporation
and
they
do
hold
that
commissions
where
a
copy
of
which
is
an
evidence,
vesting
them
with
full
police
authority.
that
comes
out
of
the
commission.
i
have
no
doubt
that
these
police
officers
have
the
same
authority
as
a
regular
policeman
does
in
the
city
of
portland.
i
also
have,
i
think
it
is
clear
in
the
record,
that
these
policemen
as
the
district
court
found,
caused
the
plaintiff
to
believe
that
they
would
be
arrested
for
trespass.
if
they
did
not
cease
and
desist,
from
their
handbilling
and
go
out
to
the
exterior
public
sidewalks,
which
they
did,
in
order
to
avoid
arrest.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
no,
you
are
talking
about
the
single
store
inside
the
business
premises
where
the
business
is--
mr.
carl
r.
neil
is
that
right?
no
that's
not
within
the
logan
valley
rule--
mr.
carl
r.
neil
i'm
not
sure
it
adds
anything
to
my
case
except
the
court’s
questions
indicated
i
guess
what
is
the
basis
for
color
of
law
under
section
1983
under
which
this
case
arose,
and
one
basis
you
could
answer
is
the
presence
of
deputy
police
officers
threatening
people
with
arrest
unless
they
abandoned
what
they
considered
to
be
their
constitutional
rights.
that
i
think
is
the
relevance
of
that
evidence
probably.
so
they
left
to
avoid
arrest.
they
were
distributing
leaflets,
the
evidence
shows
no
more
than
five
people
throughout
this
20
or
25
acre
main
part
of
lloyd
center,
different
places,
i
think
two
of
them
were
somewhere
near
each
other
in
the
meier
&
frank
entrance,
which
counsel
pointed
to
in
the
photograph.
the
rest
of
them
were
in
different
places
throughout
this
large
area.
there
is
no
evidence
whatever,
in
fact,
the
findings
and
the
evidence
are
sort
of
contrary
of
any
violence,
any
disturbance,
any
upset,
even
the
reaction,
evidence
is
very,
very
slim.
one
lady
asked
the
shopping
center
manager,
what's
going
on
here?
and
he
told
her
and
she
said,
well,
i
don't
like
those
views.
then
the
lady
told
one
of
the
leafleters
to
drop
dead
and
a
third
lady,
said
stop
bothering
him.
so,
that
is
much
public
reaction,
i
think,
for
the
nature
of
the
activity
which
was
going
on
here.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
the
evidence
shows
there
was
no
littering
your
honor.
mr.
black's
response
was
that
littering
is
a
concern
of
the
lloyd
corporation
and
they
argue
in
their
brief,
of
course
that
if
the
rule
we
contend
for
as
a
law
they
will
have
littering
expense,
expense
to
clean
up
litter.
well,
they
also
have
expense
to
clean
up
litter
when
there
are
football
rallies
a
lot
more.
they
have
expense
to
clean
up
litter
if
no
distribution
takes
place
to
public
and
passing
through
these
walkways
obviously
is
going
to
drop
some
candy
wrappers.
and
i
am
not
--
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record,
and
that
shows
the
cost
of
cleanup,
whatever
litter
might
result
from
handbilling
is
any
greater
than
the
cost
of
cleaning
up
candy
wrappers
and
like
it
will
be
dropped
by
the
public,
in
any
event.
now,
i
think
it's
important
to
emphasize
in
addition
to
what
this
case
is
about,
what
it
is
not
about.
it
does
not
involve
disturbance,
upset,
picketing
obstruction
of
a
normal
use
of
the
properties
such
as
was
present
in
adderley
versus
florida,
cox
versus
louisiana
or
cameron
versus
johnson.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
it
has
one
basis
for
showing
color
of
law
under
section
1983.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
i
would
argue
the
result
should
not
be
different.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
i
don't
believe
it
is
in
this
case
your
honor.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
well,
i
take
mr.
black’s
example
that
he
personally
kicks
them
out
if
he
is
the
president
of
the
corporation.
he
would
do
so,
undoubtedly,
under
the
trespass
laws
of
the
city
or
the
state.
now
that
seems
to
me
to
invoke
this
court’s
decision
in
adickes
v.
sh
kress.
private
party
making
use
of
the
public
statutes
to
enforce
his
policies,
in
this
case,
against
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
no
i'd
say
that's
self-defense.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
self-help.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
well,
i
can
conceive
that
happening,
but
it
seems--
mr.
carl
r.
neil
yes,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
wherever
that
occurs,
that
party
is
likely
to
invoke
the
trespass
laws
too.
he
probably--
mr.
carl
r.
neil
well,
i
suppose
he
can
do
that,
if
you’re
asking
me,
if
that
is
permissible,
does
that
change?
mr.
carl
r.
neil
it
is
something
you
can
hang
your
hat
on,
but
i
don't
think
it’s
that
important.
i
agree
with
you
your
honor.
i
have
even
broader--
mr.
carl
r.
neil
i
have
an
even
broader
ground
for
--
mr.
carl
r.
neil
i
agree
with
that
your
honor.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
that
might
not
be
the
state
action.
but
my
next
argument
would
be
that,
that
doesn't
necessarily
change
the
result
that
should
occur
in
this
case.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
yes,
it
is,
it
is
an
important
factor
but
that
isn't
the
only
thing
that
may
create
state
actions
in
this
case.
for
example--
mr.
carl
r.
neil
exactly.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
yeah,
that's
quite--
mr.
carl
r.
neil
--about--
mr.
carl
r.
neil
right.
that's
exactly
the
rationale
of
diamond
versus
bland
in
the
california
supreme
court,
where
they
say
once
you've
found
functional
equivalency
of
the
private
property
in
question
to
the
sidewalks
of
a
public
business
district,
you
have
answered
the
state
action
question
right
there.
that
is
the
rationale
of
diamond
versus
bland
i
think
is
probably
a
similar
kind
of
rationale
of
burton
versus
wilmington
parking
authority
where
you
had
the
lease
of
public
property
to
a
private
authority.
that
in
effect
you
had
a
functional
equivalent
of
the
public
parking
thing
being
operated
now
by
a
private
party.
and
once
you
reach
that,
you've
got
state
action.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
well,
the
difference,
your
honor,
is
that
the
property
initially
was
owned
by
a
public
body
in
wilmington
and
it
was
not
initially
owned,
all
of
it
at
least
by
a
public
body
in
either
logan
valley
or
this
case
as
i
mentioned.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
well,
yes
i
think
it
might
have.
for
example,
suppose
it
was
impossible
to
build
that
type
of
parking
structure
in
burton
case
without
that
happening
for
some
reason
or
another.
that's
what
i
contend
is
a
case
here.
you
could
not
build
this
type
of
shopping
center
without
vacating
public
streets
and
sidewalks.
there
had
to
be
state
aid,
state
participation
by
conveying
property
of
lloyd
corporation
here
in
order
to
permit
this
kind
of
shopping
center
to
be
built.
it
is
more
than
just
granting
them
a
zone
chain
or
something
of
that
sort.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
the
record
doesn't
show
that,
your
honor,
but
i
think
it
probably
does.
the
record
does
show
that
the
ordinance
vacating
streets
expressly
recited
that
it
was
to
permit
the
creation
of
a
general
retail
business
district
by
lloyd
corporation.
and
i
started
to
talk
about
things
this
case
doesn't
involve,
another
thing
that
it
doesn't
involve
is,
it
doesn't
involve
regulation,
any
question
in
my
opinion
of
reasonable
regulation.
it's
a
question
of
whether
the
lloyd
corporation
may
flatly
and
completely,
totally
prohibit
free
speech
or
any
kind
of
free
speech
that
it
doesn't
approve,
it
doesn't
like,
on
its
own
interior
malls
and
walkways
when
they
are
as
the
district
court
found
the
functional
equivalence
of
public
sidewalks
in
a
public
business
district.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
no,
i
don't
think
it
does
your
honor.
i
think--
mr.
carl
r.
neil
well,
i
think
it
doesn't
result,
your
honor,
because
one
of
the
things
i
am
arguing
is
that
if
the
rule
the
lloyd
corporation
seeks
is
adopted
here,
the
result
is
not
just
total
prohibition,
result
as
the
american
retail
federation
amicus
brief
clearly
says,
is
the
right
to
choose
which
speech,
which
activity,
which
non-commercial
enterprise
will
take
place
on
these
malls
and
walkways
and
not
merely
the
right
to
say
that
none
shall.
so
while
it
isn't
and
essential
to
my
position
and
i
think
that
it
is
a
result
will
occur
if
my
position
is
not
adopted.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
yes.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
yes,
i
agree,
mr.
justice
marshall
has
expressed
statement
that
he
is
not
commenting,
the
court
is
commenting
on
“unrelated
speech.”
mr.
carl
r.
neil
well
i
suppose,
we
get
an
argument
about
what
is
related
and
un-related.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
that's
true,
it's
not
related
in
a
sense
that
it
has
anything
particularly
to
do
with
any
tenant
of
the
shopping
center.
but
let's
examine
that
for
a
moment.
suppose
we
had
written
on
our
invitations
or
the
literature
handed
out
here,
to
the
employees
of
meier
&
frank,
please
join
us
tonight
at
the
church
for
a
potluck
supper
and
help
us
express
our
opposition
to
war
in
vietnam,
is
that
related
now?
do
the
leafletters
have
in
their
power
to
determine
what
is
related
and
unrelated
by
doing
something
like
that?
mr.
carl
r.
neil
yes
sir.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
well,
i
think
that
once
you
get
over
the
functional
equivalence
point
that
we
are
then
just
talking
about
reasonable
regulation
and
rather
than
prohibition.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
unrelated.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
yes,
but
notice
how
much
we've
jumped
on
it
when
we
have
said
functionally
equivalent,
we
ruled
out
all
kinds
of
premises,
we
ruled
out
hotel
apartment
lobbies,
private
residences,
interiors
of
businesses,
and
industrial
plants
for
the
most
part.
we
are
down
to
a
pretty
now
--
.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
hardware
stores,
interiors
of
hardware
stores
at
least.
i
don't
know
enough
about
the
factual
record
in
the
central
hardware
case
to
comment
on
how
appropriate
or
how
close
the
factual
situation
that
is.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
it
seems
to
me,
first
of
all
we
don't
stop
at
functional
equivalent,
functional
equivalent
of
a
public
sidewalk
in
a
public
business
district,
so
let's
go
back,
of
the
business
district.
lloyd
center
i
would
say
is
a
business
district,
in
the
same
sense
of
the
company
town
in
marsh
versus
alabama,
it's
the
business
district
or
logan
valley
plaza
was
a
business
district.
secondly,
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
public
sidewalk
in
such
a
district,
clearly
these
pedestrian
malls
and
walkway
serve
the
same
function
of
carrying
pedestrians
between
businesses
that
a
public
sidewalk
does,
and
what's
more
the
activities
that
took
place
on
them
are
much
akin
to
the
activities
that
might
take
place
on
public
sidewalk.
perhaps
they
are
even
greater,
because
they
are
broader,
and
they
can
accommodate
things
like
automobile
displays
where
as
a
public
sidewalk
could
not.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
yes,
i
do
your
honor.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
that's
true.
the
logan
valley
case
says,
your
opinion
points
out
--
mr.
carl
r.
neil
no,
in
this
case?
mr.
carl
r.
neil
no
your
honor,
we
could
not.
a
large
number
of
people,
and
the
exact
number
not
shown
by
the
record,
arised
and
leaved
solely
by
automobile.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
yes,
they
do
your
honor.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
pardon
me.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
well
i
think
that
would
be
very
difficult.
here's
automobiles
--
mr.
carl
r.
neil
right.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
well
maybe
it
is,
because
i
think
it's
so
difficult
that
there
actually
are
hazards
to
the
safety
of
person
if
you
are
trying
to
do
it,
and
is
ineffective
secondly,
because
you
can't
really
handle
leaflet
to
a
driver
removing
automobile.
let's
say,
standing
on
the
other
side.
well,
if
i
were
a
driver
leaving
--
mr.
carl
r.
neil
the
numbers
are
not
shown
as
to
how
many
come
by
bus
--
mr.
carl
r.
neil
well,
the
only
people
that
are
going
to
walk
on
that
sidewalk
are
people
who
do
not
enter
and
leave
from
the
shopping
center
by
automobile.
therefore,
they
arrive
by
bus
or
on
foot.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
the
record
doesn't
show.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
are
you
speaking
of
skating
rink,
are
you?
mr.
carl
r.
neil
skating
rink.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
they
charged
admission
from
one
thing
to
this
thing.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
yes,
and
i
suppose
you
put
it
to
me,
what
if
i
were
to
exclude
people
on
the
basis
of
race,
or
religion
or
something
of
that
sort
and
i
might
be
able
to
argue
that
it
was,
but
i
don't
think
it's
crucial
to
whether
the
malls
and
walkways
are
functional
equivalents
of
sidewalks.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
well
first
of
all,
i
limit
it
to
the
business
districts,
secondly
i
limit
it
to
the
functional
equivalence
of
sidewalks,
in
the
sense
that
sidewalks,
they
are
using
--
they
are
being
used
to
carry
pedestrian
traffic
between
businesses
within
the
business
district
and
i
think
that
you
have
then
got
to
the
functional
equivalent
provided
that
couple
of
other
conditions
don't
exist,
like
in
taggart
v.
weinacker,
is
apparently
a
sidewalk
there
was
so
narrow
that
any
exercise
of
first
amendment
speech
or
whatever
would
have
unreasonably
interfered
with
the
owner's
use
of
the
property
normally.
i
can
concede
that,
in
that
situation,
the
property
right
balance
is
greater
than
the
right
of
free
speech.
similarly,
if
the
physical
conditions
are
such
that
i
can
distribute
my
leaflet
to
to
everyone,
justice
marshall
was
talking
about,
that
are
going
to
be
on
a
sidewalk
and
i
can
distribute
it
to
everyone
of
them.
then
there
is
no
need
for
me
go
a
private
property
to
accomplish.
i
can
do
it
just
as
easily
on
that
public
sidewalk
but
i
think
this
record
shows
that
there
are
a
substantial
number
of
people,
that
are
not
going
to
be
reached
by
distributing
on
the
public
sidewalk,
around
the
shopping
center.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
well,
yes
it
is
conceivable.
it
is
also
conceivable
to
me
that
lloyd
corporation
or
the
city
of
portland,
may
adopt
regulations
that
prevent
people
from
handing
out
leaflets
in
any
manner
that
harasses
these
people,
so
that
you
must
do
it
if
you
do
it
at
all
peacefully.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
in
what
sense,
i
don't
follow
it.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
that's
true.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
well,
i
agree
that
in
first
amendment
cases,
even
on
public
sidewalks
that
there
are
difficulties
of
regulation.
this
court
has
had
many
cases
like
cox
v.
new
hampshire,
schneider
v.
state,
all
of
this
line
of
cases
where
you
have
got
permits
and
the
question
is,
is
the
permit
valid
or
the
statute
valid
because
it's
too
broad
or
too
vague,
are
difficulties
in
regulating
anything
relating
to
first
amendment,
speech
and
activity.
but
we
do
it
in
the
case
of
public
sidewalks.
it
seems
to
me
it
can
be
done
in
a
case
of
the
functional
equivalence
of
public
sidewalks,
will
happen
to
be
on
private
property.
thank
you.
