warden.
unknown
speaker
that
was
a
very
good
invitation
for
me.
don't
you
know.
that's
all
i
need
in
the
court
of
law.
merely
well
that
i
have
done
my
interview.
his
fairly
young
but
he
is
not
so
--
not
quite
as
long
as
he
looks
he
demands
his
point.
who
is
that
think
it
was
all
who
so
ever.
yes.
they
can
do
anything
to.
unknown
speaker
was
that
a
narcotics
case
also?
unknown
speaker
was
that
question
against
him?
unknown
speaker
which
way
was
mr.
zaccagnino
referring
to
of
dukes.
was
it
the
plea
in
the
conspiracy
case?
unknown
speaker
in
the
narcotics
case.
unknown
speaker
could
i
ask
you
within
the
other
proceeding
that
where
he
was
codefendant
was
some
girls.
had
he
been
sentence
in
that
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
what
was
it
later?
unknown
speaker
he
pleaded
guilty
in
that
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
denied
against
him?
unknown
speaker
eventhough
he'd
already
pleaded
guilty?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
was
there
any,
i'm
just--
the
real
reason
for
my
question
was
where
there
any
elements
of
bargain
between
the
prosecutor
and
the
dukes
with
respect
to
these
two
proceedings
going
on?
unknown
speaker
and
was
part
of
the
bargain
that
the
other
the
charge
would
be
denied?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
part
of
your
claim
as
it
any
of
zaccagnino.
unknown
speaker
zaccagnino
had
not
a
conflict,
he
had
might
made
a
better
bargain?
unknown
speaker
i
see
in
your
brief,
you
say
that
on
zaccagnino
was
talking
in
the
other
case,
you
said
that
the
"he
pointed
out
because
of
that
cooperation
with
state
police
they
capitulated
dukes
into
pleading
guilty?
unknown
speaker
so
he
had
pleaded
guilty
in
the
other
case
for
the
time
he
was.
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
he
did
actually
discussed
the
case
that
we
have
here
when
he
was
talking
at
the
sentencing
of
the
bureau
through
the
other
case.
unknown
speaker
he
mentioned
this
case?
unknown
speaker
is
the
end
result
of
your
position
that
there
must
be
a
separate
counsel
for
each
of
multiple
defendants?
unknown
speaker
in
all
cases?
unknown
speaker
what
if
where
a
simple
action
mr.
wade
since
the
breach
of
ethics
that
taken
place.
when
the
client
paid
for
the
preservation
of
ethics
in
a
constitutional
claims
that
go
beyond
the
state
of
order
come
here?
unknown
speaker
remove
them
a
due
process
of
claimant
before
he
could
committed
just
because
the
state
conducted
the
trial?
unknown
speaker
the
court
or
the
constitutional
violations?
unknown
speaker
dismissal
whose
parent
with
this
counsel.
i
supposedly
under
your
brief
it
would
be
a
conflict
of
interest
there?
i
think
the
father
wants
to
thing
has
stop
thinking
it
from
the
best
interest
of
the
juvenile,
and
yet
excluded
the
juvenile
separate
lawyers
and
did
come
along
and
say,
"well,
this
man
should
have
be
in
the
trial
and
perhaps
demanded
and
file
not
good?"
unknown
speaker
we've
got
your
juvenile
action
we
have
thoroughly
before
reaching
implication.
unknown
speaker
did
that,
i
suppose
dukes
knew
that
zaccagnino
represented
the
girls
when
he
hired?
unknown
speaker
and
zaccagnino,
in
one
of
the
early
proceedings
tried
to
withdraw
before
the
judge?
unknown
speaker
and
at
that
time,
dukes
subjected
to
the
withdraw.
unknown
speaker
was
enough?
unknown
speaker
and
that
zaccagnino
said
at
the
time
that
there
was
a
conflict
between
his
client
and
himself
and
it
wasn't
financial?
unknown
speaker
at
that
time,
had
you
have
conversation
with
zaccagnino?
unknown
speaker
that
the
other
cases
where
voice
out?
unknown
speaker
including
the
girls
case?
unknown
speaker
yes.
alright.
unknown
speaker
do
we
have
the
probation
report?
unknown
speaker
at
that
time
it
was
the
agreement
crystallize?
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
did
not
have
the
arrangement,
if
dukes
is
punished
in
the
girl's
case
was
still
in
question.
zaccagnino
representing
the
girls
in
dukes
-
in
another
case
wouldn't
be
about
to
say
that
about
dukes.
i
mean
he
shouldn't
anyway.
he-
unknown
speaker
of
course,
but
it
didn't
happened
that
way
and
it
hasn't
happened?
unknown
speaker
but
that
was
only
in
the
recommendation.
unknown
speaker
right?
unknown
speaker
but
did
the,
didn't
the
arranged
include
washing
out
or
doing
something
with
dukes'
penalty
and
the
girls
check
case?
unknown
speaker
whether
that
takes
judicial
concurrent?
unknown
speaker
it
probably
cause.
unknown
speaker
so,
did
you
know
if
pass
all
the
other
cases?
unknown
speaker
but
may
i
respect
the
suggested
judge
did
know
it
until
the
lawyer
told
him?
unknown
speaker
you
know
a
colleague
there
a
moment
ago
said
that
on
page
seven
of
his
brief
he
said
so
that
on
june
16th
that
zaccagnino
said,
"he
pointed
out
because
the
cooperation
with
the
state
police
,
they
capitulated
dukes
into
pleading
guilty."
now,
if
the
girls
didn't
know
anything
about
the
narcotic
case.
could
they
have
capitulate
him
in
the
pleading
guilty
in
the
narcotic's
case?
unknown
speaker
capitulated
the
pleading
guilty
on
the?
unknown
speaker
but
he
wasn't
talking
about
the
narcotics
case?
unknown
speaker
in
what
case
he
is
pleaded
guilty
to?
unknown
speaker
at
that
time?
unknown
speaker
when
he
was
making
that
speech
to
the
judge,
he
was
talking
about
what?
are
the
girls
persuading
in
the
plea
guilty
in
the
narcotics
case.
unknown
speaker
but
he
pleaded
guilty
to
anything
else?
unknown
speaker
all
he
agreed
to
plead
guilty.
unknown
speaker
but
he
agreed
on
the
other
case,
isn't?
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
idea
that
you
know
about
him?
unknown
speaker
ha
had
some
other
cases
too,
didn't
he?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
maximum
exposure
to
that
he
had?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
didn't
charge
he
was
the
second
offender?
unknown
speaker
i'm
saying
that
he
got
five
to?
unknown
speaker
can
you
mathematically
rule
out
the
possibility
that
you
could
have
thought
about
somewhere
between
june
16th
after?
unknown
speaker
he
certainly
do
that
in
fact
zaccagnino
was
representing
both
the
girls
and
dukes?
unknown
speaker
on
june
2nd,
he
heard
from
zaccagnino
about
dukes
and
on
june
the
2nd
he
heard
from
zaccagnino
about
the
girls.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
wasn't
there
was
a
short
proceeding
on
june
2nd.
in
this
case,
zaccagnino
was
there.
unknown
speaker
alright,
and
then
either
before
after
that
on
the
same
day.
zaccagnino
is
representing
the
girl.
unknown
speaker
and
makes
his
remarks.
unknown
speaker
and
then
in
dukes.
unknown
speaker
let's
suppose
to
take
your
hypothetical
event,
there
have
been
two
separate
lawyers.
are
you
suggesting
that
on
that
day
that
this
man
was
entitled
to
have
a
lawyer
there
to
hear
what's
been
said
about
him?
unknown
speaker
i
think
so.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
that
the
court
consumed
this
man
to
fully
advise
this
man
that
he
wins
his
case,
he
might
be
back
and
have
4
or
5
cases
with
an
act
get
it
up
as
i
calculated
to
25
years.
