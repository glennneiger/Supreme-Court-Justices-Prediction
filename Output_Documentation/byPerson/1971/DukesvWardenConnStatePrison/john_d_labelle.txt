mr.
john
d.
labelle
mr.
chief
justice,
visitor
of
the
court.
the
petitioner
here,
we
supports
these
two
things.
he
assumed
that
there's
a
conflict
of
interest,
in
many
cases
his
whole
arguing
on
that
and
he
also
presupposes
that
there
was
prejudice
to
the
petition.
neither
of
these
exists.
in
order
to
have
a
conflict
of
interest,
it
requires
more
than
just
joint
representation.
it
also
requires
that
there
be
antagonistic
interest
between
the
people
jointly
represented.
now,
you
don't
have
that
worked
who
have
two
separate
cases,
one
in
the
narcotics
license
case,
one
the
girl's
case.
now,
let
me
give
you
the
actual
background
here.
so,
that
the
court
will
understand
just
what
happened
and
you
will
see
that
there
is
no
conflict
of
interest
here
nor
and
never
was.
in
this
check
case
with
the
girls,
dukes
was
involved.
he
was
using
these
girls
going
on
all
over
the
state
in
connecticut,
cashing
checks.
the
girls
cashed
the
checks
that
he
would
furnish
to
him,
some
where
traveler's
checks,
somewhere
money
order,
somewhere
stolen
checks
with
names
imprinted.
he
gave
his
drivers
licenses
and
other
identifications,
and
this
went
around
in
most
of
the
towns
of
hartford
new
county,
into
the
new
haven
county,
in
the
fairfield
county.
now,
the
state
police
go
on
with
this
investigation
in
november
and
december
1966,
and
as
a
result
it,
if
the
girls
were
picked
up
and
when
were
they
pick
up
they
told
the
state
police
the
whole
story,
verse
by
verse.
it
gave
statements,
affidavits,
the
whole
things
and
a
s
a
result
of
that,
of
course
they
were
arrested.
and
by
the
way,
they
were
four
girls
and
another
man
involved
in
this
besides
dukes.
consequently,
a
warrant
was
issued
for
the
arrest
of
the
girls
in
december
of
1966.
a
warrant
was
issued
for
dukes.
now
in
the
warrant
for
the
arrest
of
dukes,
one
of
the
affidavits
supporting
that
warrant
was
a
statement
from
the
girls
or
one
of
the
girls
about
dukes
involvement
in
the
check
case.
so,
duke
knew
it
from
the
arrest
warrant.
in
duke's
case
also,
there
were
two
other
charges
added
into
his
warrant
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
check
case.
two
are
the
narcotics
sales.
alright,
that
case
it's
into
the
superior
court.
the
girls
have
cooperated;
they
got
mr.
zaccagnino
to
represent
them.
he
was
representing
the
girls
and
dukes
knew
it.
dukes
also
knew
his
involvement
with
the
girls.
while
mr.
zaccagnino
is
representing
the
girls
in
the
check
case,
mr.
duke
went
to
him
and
said
"will
you
represent
me
in
the
narcotic
case."
a
new
narcotic
case,
not
the
one
that
was
involved
in
the
bench
warrant,
because
on
march
14th,
dukes
got
arrested
again
for
selling
narcotics,
and
this
is
the
case
in
the
appendix.
this
is
the
case
that
in
the
appendix
where
the
search
warrant
is
there,
where
they
went
in
with
the
search
warrant.
they
had
made
purchase
from
dukes
did
before
the
warrant
is
executed.
they
went
in
his
house
and
found
all
kinds
of
narcotics,
a
perfectly
group
solid
cold
case
and
also
found
stolen
goods.
that
is
the
two
counts
that
he
pleaded.
now,
when
these
cases
all
came
in
the
court
and
i
have
some
more
cases
in
the
supreme
court
against
dukes.
i
looked
at
the
files
and
i
set
the
case
to
try.
is
the
last
narcotic
case.
the
one
where
there
was
a
search
warrant.
what
we
had
a
cold
case,
dukes
was
second
offender,
he
was
warned
above
and
i
set
the
case
down
for
trial,
and
told
mr.
zaccagnino
to
be
ready
as
soon
as
we
go
to
the
court.
the
record
shows
mr.
zaccagnino
was
there
and
this
by
the
way
was
the
2nd
of
may,
the
week
of
the
2nd
of
may
1967.
mr.
zaccagnino
was
there
and
he
hang
around
for
that
week
and
on
may
9,
he
came
on,
we've
got
a
court
room.
and
now
we've
come
to
the
proceedings
in
the
court
on
may
9th.
meanwhile,
the
girls
case
has
been
going
separately.
they
wasn't
any
connections
to
this
narcotics
case.
the
girls
were
witnesses
on
it.
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
it.
it's
never
been
claimed
that
had
anything
to
do
with
it.
the
girls
have
pleaded
guilty,
and
their
case
were
waiting
to
be
sentenced.
and
there's
no
connection
whatsoever
with
this
case
which
was
right
for
trial.
now,
when
he
got
ready
for
trial,
he
had
to
be
pin
him
that
in
order
to
get
the
plea,
and
that's
when
we
there's
conflict
to
which
we
came
up
between
mr.
zaccagnino
and
mr.
dukes.
and
it
says
in
colloquia
on
may
9th,
this
is
like
conflict
between
my
client
maybe
because
mr.
zaccagnino
with
his
best
judgment
was
advising
him,
"you've
got
to
plead
guilty",
you've
got
all
these
cases
pending
against
you.
he
have
warrants
outstanding
on
the
check
charges
in
new
haven
in
fairfield
county.
he
had
this
good
case
that
we
were
getting
ready
to
try,
which
was
a
cold
case
and
mr.
zaccagnino
knew
it.
and
so,
he
was
saying
to
dukes,
"your
only
chance
here
is
to
plea
guilty
and
wipe
out
all
these
cases
at
once."
and
our
board
of
the
states
attorney
and
get
a
recommendation,
which
he
did.
it
didn't
go
on
may
9th
because
it
was
continued
because
of
this
zaccagnino
advising
him
and
he
hadn't
taking
his
advice
and
it
was
continued
for
one
day,
then
it
was
postponed
for
a
week,
went
over
to
may
16th.
on
may
16th,
dukes
came
back
in
the
court
with
mr.
delaney,
mr.
zaccagnino's
partner,
and
the
same
thing
happened
all
over
again.
i
was
ready
on
court
with
the
courtroom
and
a
jury
and
the
witnesses
to
put
the
narcotics
case
on.
and
finally,
after
a
lot
of
negotiations
during
the
morning,
mr.
dukes
pleaded
guilty
and
the
proceedings
of
may
16th
show
that
and
this
is
when
judge
johnson,
now
is
the
judge.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
sure,
then
a
recommendation
was
to
be
made.
this
was
an
agreed
recommendation
and
that
was.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
with
all
the
other
cases
including.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
it
was
to
get
to
current
sentences
including
the
new
haven
in
fairfield
county
cases.
these
appears
in
the
minute
in
the
last.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
so,
he
pleaded
guilty.
now,
judge
johnson
who
makes
the
inquiry.
now,
you
want
to
here
last
week
with
mr.
zaccagnino,
and
there
seem
to
be
some
doubt
in
your
mind
about
whether
you
wanted
mr.
zaccagnino
when
you
were
looking
to
get
other
councel.
are
you
satisfied
today
with
his
partner,
mr.
delaney?
and
you
can
see
all
of
these
in
the
may
16th
transcript
and
the
questions,
you
know
you're
giving
up
your
right
to
trial
now.
the
state
is
ready
to
go
forward
today,
you
know
that.
and
so
on.
and
all
went
in
the
guilty
plea
was
accepted
and
it
was
referred
for
a
pre-sentence
report.
it
was
assigned
for
june
2nd
for
disposition?
mr.
zaccagnino
in
accordance
with
the
plea
bargain
arrangement
with
me
asked
me
asked
me
cases
consolidated
from
fairfield
county
in
new
haven
county.
plus
all
the
cases
we
had
in
hartford
county.
and
you
know,
from
the
appendix
in
the
respondent's
brief
that
in
order
to
consolidate
those
cases,
it's
required
that
guilty
pleas
be
entered.
both
states
attorneys
have
to
agree
with
the
consolidation
and
the
statute
says,
"he
must
plead
guilty
to
all
cases."
which
he
was
going
to
do.
it
went
to
june
2nd,
the
date
it
was
assigned
for
disposition,
and
you'll
see
there
is
a
short
proceeding
on
june
2nd
where
mr.
zaccagnino
says,
"this
case
your
honor
has
to
be
postpone
because
the
consolidated
cases
from
the
other
counties
haven't
got
here,
also
the
pre-sentence
report
wasn't
ready."
so,
it
was
put
down
for
disposition
now
to
june
16th.
now,
that
morning
in
court
on
june
2nd,
mr.
zaccagnino
then
appeared
with
the
girls
in
the
check
case
because
it
happen
to
be
that
the
check
case
was
set
down
for
disposition
of
the
girls,
the
same
day.
now,
i
don't
claim
that
mr.
dukes
was
in
court,
when
the
girls
where
sentenced.
he
probably
wasn't,
because
he
couldn't
be
there
for
the
continuous
and
not
stayed
for
the
girls
part.
but
on
june
2nd
when
the
girls
were
sentenced,
mr.
zaccagnino
made
these
remarks
about
the
girls,
in
the
girl's
case
about
their
involvement
with
dukes.
now
this
is
what
happened,
those
remarks
where
before
the
court
in
the
pre-sentence
is
required
on
the
girls.
the
whole
thing
in
stage
was
laid
up
to
the
judge.
the
prosecutor
when
he
got
up
said,
"these
girls
got
into
this
thing
because
of
dukes."
the
girls
statements
was
attached
to
the
probation
reports.
said
the
judge
devon
now,
the
sentencing
judge,
had
before
him
everything
about
the
girl's
in
the
check
case.
and
in
that
information
it
said
that
dukes
have
used
them
to
cash
these
checks.
no
secret.
all
these
was
a
set
of
facts
that
mr.
zaccagnino
had.
and
he
didn't
do
anything
about
manufacturing
them.
he
didn't
do
anything
about
them
all.
he
simply
said,
"your
honor
this
is
it."
mr.
john
d.
labelle
and
on
the
girl's,
no.
but
it
is
seen
in
the
record
that
supreme
court
in
connecticut
looked
up
on
him,
and
it
says
in
its
opinion
specifically,
that
postpone
that
thing
was
laid
out
before
the
court
in
the
girls
probation
reports.
so,
what
mr.
zaccagnino
was
saying
to
judge
devon
about
the
girls,
was
before
him
anyway?
now
let's
look
at
this,
this
is
a
conflict
of
interest.
supposing
the
girls
were
represented
on
that
day
by
another
lawyer,
not
mr.
zaccagnino.
wouldn't
that
other
related
happen
have
been
say
about
dukes,
that
he
is
responsible
for
the
girls
be
in
this
trouble?
he
would
have
said
it
in
stage,
would
he?
you
can't
say
that
in
that
situation,
in
two
weeks
later
judge
devon
couldn't
say
mr.
dukes
-
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes!
that
has
been
crystallized
back
on
may
16th
when
dukes
pleaded
guilty.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes,
that's
correct
your
honor.
if
for
instance
we
came
in
and
put
dukes
on
in
the
check
case
later
on,
and
zaccagnino
was
representing
him
there,
then
he
would
have
conflict.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
there
was
an
arrangement
that
there
was
to
be
concurring
sentences
that's
in
the
record.
see
that
there
is
a
120
to
123
of
the
appendix
that
this
was
a
recommendation
was
to
get
up
concurrent
sentences
with
a
blocking
all
these
cases.
now.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
oh,
yes!
mr.
john
d.
labelle
judge
demon
was
not
bound
by
it
of
course.
but
it
is
significant
that
on
june
16th,
when
dukes
is
sentenced
in
the
narcotics
case.
he
got
the
judge
devon
filed
the
recommendation.
now
on
june
16,
its
significant
that
there
was
nothing
before
judge
devon
to
remind
him
about
the
dukes
being
involved
with
the
girls.
it
wasn't
in
the
probation
report,
the
dukes
probation
report,
it
wasn't
mentioned?
nobody
mentioned
it
to
judge
devon
and
now
counsel
says,
"what
judge
devon
heard
in
two
weeks
ago,
he
probably
remembers
it."
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes,
it
did.
and
on
june
16
-
mr.
john
d.
labelle
no,
because
we
never
brought
those
cases
up
to
judge
devon
for
disposition.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
i
did
that
afterwards
because
on
june
16th,
dukes
refused
to
plead
to
the
cases
that
where
being
consolidated,
and
refused
to
plead
anything
else.
he
changed
his
mind.
then
judge
devon
he
ask
that
had
his
case
postponed
and
i
use
to
have
a
chance
to
get
new
counsel,
and
judge
devon
said,
you
had
a
whole
month
to
make
up
your
mind
about
this,
since
may
16th
to
june
16th,
you
haven't
done
anything
about
it?
this
is
simply
a
ploy
to
get
delaying
your
sentencing.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
then
after
the
appeal,
the
direct
appeal
was
finished.
i
now
pass
all
my
other
cases
and
i
asked
each
attorneys
in
fairfield,
new
haven
county
to
null
this.
this
is
after
the
direct
appeal
on
this
case.
this
was
some
2
years
afterwards
i
agree,
but
i
carried
all
our
bargain
completely.
now,
you
must
remember
that
he
took
the
direct
appeal
and
he
never
mentioned
any
conflict
of
interest?
he
had
another
lawyer
at
that
time,
and
he
did
not
mention
conflict
of
interest.
we
brought
it
habeas
corpus
in
federal
court
and
he
did
not
mention
conflict
of
interest?
and
when
you
look
at
the
transcript
in
this
case,
to
the
state
dukes
doesn't
claim
that
mr.
zaccagnino
gave
him
anything
but
good
service.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
plea
bargain
he
got.
if
you
look
at
the
record
in
all
these
cases,
he
got
a
good
result
and
mr.
zaccagnino
did
a
fine
job
for
him.
now,
there
is
the
situation
that
comes
up.
now,
let
me
suggest
other
two
things
why
they
don't
have
in
there
sixth
amendment
violations
or
fourteenth
amendment
violations.
in
the
first
place,
the
reason
is
showing
of
an
antagonistic
interest
between
the
parties
here,
was
represented
by
mr.
zaccagnino
in
the
particular
case,
because
there
was
nothing
to
do
in
the
narcotic
case
to
which
dukes
plead
in
the
sentence
with
the
girls.
they
didn't
appear
with
it,
they
never
appeared
in
it,
and
there
was
no
connection
to
it,
nothing
at
all.
mr.
zaccagnino
never
bargain
off
the
girls
and
saying
that,
i'm
going
to
say
to
dukes,
"if
you
don't
plea
guilty
on
our
narcotics
case,
these
girls
are
going
to
testify
against
you."
that
was
wrong
says
no
by
dukes.
it
was
known
way
back
in
december
that
they
were
going
to
cooperate
in
mr.
zaccagnino
refuse.
but
that
never
came
up.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
right.
now,
that's
very
important
here
on
the
other
element.
if
mr.
dukes
wanted
to
claim
this
conflict
of
interest
on
the
day
he
was
sentenced
on
june
16th,
he
should
have
said
something
to
the
court.
he
asked
for
the
counsel,
he
was
given
plenty
of
opportunities
by
the
judge
to
settle
something.
he
asked
why
he
wanted
another
counsel.
what
was
the
matter
with
mr.
zaccagnino
and
he
never
got
this
out
him?
he
did
ever
say
to
judge
devon,
i
have
bad
day
by
mr.
zaccagnino,
or
any
complain,
and
he
doesn't
complain
toward
to
this
day.
he
didn't
even
in
his
testimony
in
the
habeas
corpus
trial.
now,
aren't
you
fix--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
no,
that
is
not.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
i
don't
know
what
he
meant
by
that,
except
for
the
fact
that
he
had
ask
for
the
other
check
cases
to
be
consolidated
for
fairfield
in
new
haven
county.
that
they
were
going
to.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
he
couldn't
be
because
there
was
never
any
connection.
never
any
connection.
no,
i
wouldn't
do
that
with
mr.
dukes
on
the
cross
examination
in
the
habeas
corpus
and
i
asked
him,
"where
you
talking
about
the
narcotics
case?"
and
he
said,
"well,
i
don't
think
i
couldn't
have
been
looking
at
my
remarks."
but
there
wasn't
any
discussion
[voice
overlaps].
mr.
john
d.
labelle
he
pleaded
guilty
on
the
narcotics
and
the
larceny
case.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
he
never
pleaded
on
the
check
case
and
he
never
was
said
so.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
by
what
he
seems
to
say
but
that
couldn't
[voice
overlaps]
mr.
john
d.
labelle
no,
just
the
narcotics
case.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
he
had
a
agreed
and
then
change
his
mind
the
last
day,
on
june
16th
but
he
don't
say
it.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes.
in
this
whole
case
you'll
see
that
both
mr.
delaney
and
mr.
zaccagnino
were
interested
in
wrapping
up
all
the
charges.
its
indicates
that
the
state's
attorney
was
going
to
recommend
concurrent
sentences
that
appears.
now.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
not
less
than
five
more
than
10
years
on
narcotics
count.
two
years
on
the
larceny
count,
making
effective
sentence
on
not
less
than
five
and
more
than
12.
now,
it's
significant
that
in
the
narcotics
charge.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes
and
with
all
the
other
cases,
we
have
been
nullied.
and
that
seems
what
he
wouldn't
have
got
if
he
had
pleaded
to
all
of
them.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
while,
he
was
the
second
offender
in
on
the
narcotic
case.
it
is
a
mandatory
minimum
of
five
years
and
a
maximum
of
10,
if
he
is
the
first
offender,
and
as
a
second
offender,
that
was
doubled.
so,
he
had
on
the
narcotics
case
along
that
exposure
of
not
less
than
10
or
more
than
20.
and
he
had
an
addition
of
that,
what
could
be
added
on
five
years
more
for
the
larceny.
so,
he
had
an
exposure
at
that
point
when
we
were
going
to
trial
in
the
narcotics
case
of
10
to
20
on
the
narcotics,
if
he
was
convicted
in
the
charge
as
a
second
offender,
plus
the
10
years
on
the
larceny.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
i
have
him
warned
and
i
didn't
charge
him,
because
he
pleaded.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
he
got
five
to
10
and
the
five
was
a
mandatory
minimum
on
the
narcotics
charge
under
our
statute.
on
the
narcotic
charge,
it
was
required
that
he
got
atleast
five,
unless
it
was
suspended.
but
he
has
to
get
five
and
with
this
kind
of
case
of
course,
it
could
be
suspended.
now,
there's
one
other
key
to
these
whole
case,
and
i'm
might
respectful
to
ask
the
court
just
to
bare
with
me.
there
is
a
duty
on
the
partition
here
if
he
was
not
satisfied
with
his
counsel
to
have
told
judge
devon
about
it.
he
didn't
do
that
and
counsel
has
said
for
the
petitioner,
that
he
couldn't
do
that,
because
he
didn't
know
what
dukes
had
said
about
it
or
what
zaccagnino
had
said
about
him
the
day
the
girls
was
sentenced.
nobody
bothered
me
all
through
this
case
but
i
finally
found
it
out
a
few
days
ago.
the
first
place
when
this
habeas
corpus
was
started,
long
after
the
direct
appeal
now,
and
after
federal
habeas
corpus
and
nothing
was
said.
he
started
the
habeas
corpus
from
the
person
and
he
mentioned
the
conflict
of
interest.
well,
i
would
then
have
wonder
how
could
he
hadn't
known
about
that
at
this
time
in
prison.
and
then
right
after
he
started
the
action
and
before
mr.
wade
was
appointed
for
him
under
articles
conviction
proceedings.
he
wrote
a
letter
to
the
clerk
of
the
court.
he
then
give
the
letter
to
the
clerk
of
the
court,
this
is
in
the
files.
he
said,
"would
you
please
send
me
your
transcript
of
what
mr.
zaccagnino
said
about
me
and
the
girl's
case,
said
that
you
would
on
wouldn't
bail
me."
now,
it's
obviously
he
had
ignored
what
they
said
because
he
started
his
habeas
corpus
action
before
this.
because
he
says
in
the
letter,
"i
want
to
use
this
transcript
in
my
habeas
corpus
hearing
that
is
coming
up."
so,
that
made
he
had
to
ignore
about
it
himself.
now,
since
he
have
to
ignore
about
it,
he
must
to
know
about
on
june2nd
and
that's
the
day
on
june
16th,
two
weeks
later,
that
he
knew
about
it,
he
should
have
told
judge
devon,
that
i'm
not
being
properly
represented
because
of
a
conflict
of
interest.
what's
for?
mr.
john
d.
labelle
well
i
agree
your
honor
that
i
said
earlier,
that
i
couldn't
guarantee
you,
is
that
the
problem
when
that
had
happened?
when
i
count
you
at
but
i
finally
found
it.
it
is
on
page
of
163
of
the
appendix
and
i'm
asking
him
about
being
in
court
on
june
2nd.
i
was
trying
to
establish
and
he
must
of
heard
the
girls
when
they're
sentenced.
he
says,
he
was
but
now
listen
to
this,
at
the
top
of
the
page
163.
this
is
his
answer,
"i'm
trying
to
think
of
the
day
that
the
girls
got
sentenced,
because
i
was
not
in
court
the
day
they
got
sentenced.
because
i
knew
and
i
wasn't
in
court
that
specific
day
because,
that's
when
i
was
told
what
was
said
about
me."
so
there
it
is,
that's
the
key
to
the
whole
case.
he
knew
that
he
what
he
was
said
about
him,
he
never
complained,
he
never
troubled
judge
devon
about
it
on
june
16,and
if
he
wanted
to,
he
should
have
raised
it
then
and
he
have
plenty
of
opportunities
because
the
record
in
the
case,
judge
devon
gave
him
every
chance
to
speak,
and
tell
him
what
his
trouble
was.
now
in
his
plea,
that
if
you're
going
to
allege
this
kind
of
a
conflict
of
interest,
there's
a
duty
of
notifying
the
trial
court,
and
give
the
trial
court
a
chance
to
rule
on
it.
here
you
have
what
we're
saying
in
this
case,
if
this
case
is
reversed.
we're
going
to
reverse
judge
devon
for
something
that
he
never
knew
about?
and
for
something
that
he
hasn't
ruled
on
and
he
didn't
know
one
thing
about.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
i
think
so.
you
must
presume
that
if
you
remember
what
happened
two
weeks
before.
i'm
not
sure
of
that.
i
don't
know
that
he
this
was
busy
court.
he
have
a
lot
of
other
cases,
whether
or
not
he
remembered
the
girls
case
that
this
was
the
same
dukes,
i
don't
know.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
no,
it
was
june
16th,
it
was
two
weeks
later
and
a
lot
of
things
happen
in
between.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes,
just
continuance.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
right.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes.
i'm
not
saying
that
judge
devon
may
not
have
remembered.
but
what
is
done
here
if
you
have
this
specifically
called
his
attention,
is
presuming
that
he
took
into
the
consideration
in
sentence
a
dukes
on
the
narcotic
case.
some
other
information
he
had
from
outside
and
you
can't
presume
that
a
trial
judge
is
doing
something
wrong
unless
his
been
notified
about
it.
and
in
this
instance,
judge
devon
certainly
didn't
do
anything
other
than
follow
the
state's
recommendation.
the
agreed
recommendation,
the
plea
bargain
recommendation,
so
that
you
can't
say
that
even
if
you
remember
the
dukes
case.
that
he
had
done
anything
that
was
proper
advice
following
the
recommendation.
he
doesn't
say
one
word
about
in
his
remarks
at
the
time
of
sentencing,
judge
devon
does.
so,
that
the
key
to
the
case
is
that
dukes
knew
about
this
remarks
by
zaccagnino
on
june
2nd
in
the
girls
case.
he
didn't
think
anything
about
it,
or
tell
the
judge
about
it
at
any
time
and
you're
asking
this
court
to
overrule
judge
devon
in
the
matter
that
he
never
had
a
chance
to
rule
on.
when
it
was
never
called
to
his
attention
when
there
was
a
duty
and
on
counsel
and
on
the
petitions,
if
you
want
to
raised
it
to
say
so.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
mr.
chief
justice,
visitor
of
the
court.
the
petitioner
here,
we
supports
these
two
things.
he
assumed
that
there's
a
conflict
of
interest,
in
many
cases
his
whole
arguing
on
that
and
he
also
presupposes
that
there
was
prejudice
to
the
petition.
neither
of
these
exists.
in
order
to
have
a
conflict
of
interest,
it
requires
more
than
just
joint
representation.
it
also
requires
that
there
be
antagonistic
interest
between
the
people
jointly
represented.
now,
you
don't
have
that
worked
who
have
two
separate
cases,
one
in
the
narcotics
license
case,
one
the
girl's
case.
now,
let
me
give
you
the
actual
background
here.
so,
that
the
court
will
understand
just
what
happened
and
you
will
see
that
there
is
no
conflict
of
interest
here
nor
and
never
was.
in
this
check
case
with
the
girls,
dukes
was
involved.
he
was
using
these
girls
going
on
all
over
the
state
in
connecticut,
cashing
checks.
the
girls
cashed
the
checks
that
he
would
furnish
to
him,
some
where
traveler's
checks,
somewhere
money
order,
somewhere
stolen
checks
with
names
imprinted.
he
gave
his
drivers
licenses
and
other
identifications,
and
this
went
around
in
most
of
the
towns
of
hartford
new
county,
into
the
new
haven
county,
in
the
fairfield
county.
now,
the
state
police
go
on
with
this
investigation
in
november
and
december
1966,
and
as
a
result
it,
if
the
girls
were
picked
up
and
when
were
they
pick
up
they
told
the
state
police
the
whole
story,
verse
by
verse.
it
gave
statements,
affidavits,
the
whole
things
and
a
s
a
result
of
that,
of
course
they
were
arrested.
and
by
the
way,
they
were
four
girls
and
another
man
involved
in
this
besides
dukes.
consequently,
a
warrant
was
issued
for
the
arrest
of
the
girls
in
december
of
1966.
a
warrant
was
issued
for
dukes.
now
in
the
warrant
for
the
arrest
of
dukes,
one
of
the
affidavits
supporting
that
warrant
was
a
statement
from
the
girls
or
one
of
the
girls
about
dukes
involvement
in
the
check
case.
so,
duke
knew
it
from
the
arrest
warrant.
in
duke's
case
also,
there
were
two
other
charges
added
into
his
warrant
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
check
case.
two
are
the
narcotics
sales.
alright,
that
case
it's
into
the
superior
court.
the
girls
have
cooperated;
they
got
mr.
zaccagnino
to
represent
them.
he
was
representing
the
girls
and
dukes
knew
it.
dukes
also
knew
his
involvement
with
the
girls.
while
mr.
zaccagnino
is
representing
the
girls
in
the
check
case,
mr.
duke
went
to
him
and
said
"will
you
represent
me
in
the
narcotic
case."
a
new
narcotic
case,
not
the
one
that
was
involved
in
the
bench
warrant,
because
on
march
14th,
dukes
got
arrested
again
for
selling
narcotics,
and
this
is
the
case
in
the
appendix.
this
is
the
case
that
in
the
appendix
where
the
search
warrant
is
there,
where
they
went
in
with
the
search
warrant.
they
had
made
purchase
from
dukes
did
before
the
warrant
is
executed.
they
went
in
his
house
and
found
all
kinds
of
narcotics,
a
perfectly
group
solid
cold
case
and
also
found
stolen
goods.
that
is
the
two
counts
that
he
pleaded.
now,
when
these
cases
all
came
in
the
court
and
i
have
some
more
cases
in
the
supreme
court
against
dukes.
i
looked
at
the
files
and
i
set
the
case
to
try.
is
the
last
narcotic
case.
the
one
where
there
was
a
search
warrant.
what
we
had
a
cold
case,
dukes
was
second
offender,
he
was
warned
above
and
i
set
the
case
down
for
trial,
and
told
mr.
zaccagnino
to
be
ready
as
soon
as
we
go
to
the
court.
the
record
shows
mr.
zaccagnino
was
there
and
this
by
the
way
was
the
2nd
of
may,
the
week
of
the
2nd
of
may
1967.
mr.
zaccagnino
was
there
and
he
hang
around
for
that
week
and
on
may
9,
he
came
on,
we've
got
a
court
room.
and
now
we've
come
to
the
proceedings
in
the
court
on
may
9th.
meanwhile,
the
girls
case
has
been
going
separately.
they
wasn't
any
connections
to
this
narcotics
case.
the
girls
were
witnesses
on
it.
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
it.
it's
never
been
claimed
that
had
anything
to
do
with
it.
the
girls
have
pleaded
guilty,
and
their
case
were
waiting
to
be
sentenced.
and
there's
no
connection
whatsoever
with
this
case
which
was
right
for
trial.
now,
when
he
got
ready
for
trial,
he
had
to
be
pin
him
that
in
order
to
get
the
plea,
and
that's
when
we
there's
conflict
to
which
we
came
up
between
mr.
zaccagnino
and
mr.
dukes.
and
it
says
in
colloquia
on
may
9th,
this
is
like
conflict
between
my
client
maybe
because
mr.
zaccagnino
with
his
best
judgment
was
advising
him,
"you've
got
to
plead
guilty",
you've
got
all
these
cases
pending
against
you.
he
have
warrants
outstanding
on
the
check
charges
in
new
haven
in
fairfield
county.
he
had
this
good
case
that
we
were
getting
ready
to
try,
which
was
a
cold
case
and
mr.
zaccagnino
knew
it.
and
so,
he
was
saying
to
dukes,
"your
only
chance
here
is
to
plea
guilty
and
wipe
out
all
these
cases
at
once."
and
our
board
of
the
states
attorney
and
get
a
recommendation,
which
he
did.
it
didn't
go
on
may
9th
because
it
was
continued
because
of
this
zaccagnino
advising
him
and
he
hadn't
taking
his
advice
and
it
was
continued
for
one
day,
then
it
was
postponed
for
a
week,
went
over
to
may
16th.
on
may
16th,
dukes
came
back
in
the
court
with
mr.
delaney,
mr.
zaccagnino's
partner,
and
the
same
thing
happened
all
over
again.
i
was
ready
on
court
with
the
courtroom
and
a
jury
and
the
witnesses
to
put
the
narcotics
case
on.
and
finally,
after
a
lot
of
negotiations
during
the
morning,
mr.
dukes
pleaded
guilty
and
the
proceedings
of
may
16th
show
that
and
this
is
when
judge
johnson,
now
is
the
judge.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
sure,
then
a
recommendation
was
to
be
made.
this
was
an
agreed
recommendation
and
that
was.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
with
all
the
other
cases
including.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
it
was
to
get
to
current
sentences
including
the
new
haven
in
fairfield
county
cases.
these
appears
in
the
minute
in
the
last.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
so,
he
pleaded
guilty.
now,
judge
johnson
who
makes
the
inquiry.
now,
you
want
to
here
last
week
with
mr.
zaccagnino,
and
there
seem
to
be
some
doubt
in
your
mind
about
whether
you
wanted
mr.
zaccagnino
when
you
were
looking
to
get
other
councel.
are
you
satisfied
today
with
his
partner,
mr.
delaney?
and
you
can
see
all
of
these
in
the
may
16th
transcript
and
the
questions,
you
know
you're
giving
up
your
right
to
trial
now.
the
state
is
ready
to
go
forward
today,
you
know
that.
and
so
on.
and
all
went
in
the
guilty
plea
was
accepted
and
it
was
referred
for
a
pre-sentence
report.
it
was
assigned
for
june
2nd
for
disposition?
mr.
zaccagnino
in
accordance
with
the
plea
bargain
arrangement
with
me
asked
me
asked
me
cases
consolidated
from
fairfield
county
in
new
haven
county.
plus
all
the
cases
we
had
in
hartford
county.
and
you
know,
from
the
appendix
in
the
respondent's
brief
that
in
order
to
consolidate
those
cases,
it's
required
that
guilty
pleas
be
entered.
both
states
attorneys
have
to
agree
with
the
consolidation
and
the
statute
says,
"he
must
plead
guilty
to
all
cases."
which
he
was
going
to
do.
it
went
to
june
2nd,
the
date
it
was
assigned
for
disposition,
and
you'll
see
there
is
a
short
proceeding
on
june
2nd
where
mr.
zaccagnino
says,
"this
case
your
honor
has
to
be
postpone
because
the
consolidated
cases
from
the
other
counties
haven't
got
here,
also
the
pre-sentence
report
wasn't
ready."
so,
it
was
put
down
for
disposition
now
to
june
16th.
now,
that
morning
in
court
on
june
2nd,
mr.
zaccagnino
then
appeared
with
the
girls
in
the
check
case
because
it
happen
to
be
that
the
check
case
was
set
down
for
disposition
of
the
girls,
the
same
day.
now,
i
don't
claim
that
mr.
dukes
was
in
court,
when
the
girls
where
sentenced.
he
probably
wasn't,
because
he
couldn't
be
there
for
the
continuous
and
not
stayed
for
the
girls
part.
but
on
june
2nd
when
the
girls
were
sentenced,
mr.
zaccagnino
made
these
remarks
about
the
girls,
in
the
girl's
case
about
their
involvement
with
dukes.
now
this
is
what
happened,
those
remarks
where
before
the
court
in
the
pre-sentence
is
required
on
the
girls.
the
whole
thing
in
stage
was
laid
up
to
the
judge.
the
prosecutor
when
he
got
up
said,
"these
girls
got
into
this
thing
because
of
dukes."
the
girls
statements
was
attached
to
the
probation
reports.
said
the
judge
devon
now,
the
sentencing
judge,
had
before
him
everything
about
the
girl's
in
the
check
case.
and
in
that
information
it
said
that
dukes
have
used
them
to
cash
these
checks.
no
secret.
all
these
was
a
set
of
facts
that
mr.
zaccagnino
had.
and
he
didn't
do
anything
about
manufacturing
them.
he
didn't
do
anything
about
them
all.
he
simply
said,
"your
honor
this
is
it."
mr.
john
d.
labelle
and
on
the
girl's,
no.
but
it
is
seen
in
the
record
that
supreme
court
in
connecticut
looked
up
on
him,
and
it
says
in
its
opinion
specifically,
that
postpone
that
thing
was
laid
out
before
the
court
in
the
girls
probation
reports.
so,
what
mr.
zaccagnino
was
saying
to
judge
devon
about
the
girls,
was
before
him
anyway?
now
let's
look
at
this,
this
is
a
conflict
of
interest.
supposing
the
girls
were
represented
on
that
day
by
another
lawyer,
not
mr.
zaccagnino.
wouldn't
that
other
related
happen
have
been
say
about
dukes,
that
he
is
responsible
for
the
girls
be
in
this
trouble?
he
would
have
said
it
in
stage,
would
he?
you
can't
say
that
in
that
situation,
in
two
weeks
later
judge
devon
couldn't
say
mr.
dukes
-
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes!
that
has
been
crystallized
back
on
may
16th
when
dukes
pleaded
guilty.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes,
that's
correct
your
honor.
if
for
instance
we
came
in
and
put
dukes
on
in
the
check
case
later
on,
and
zaccagnino
was
representing
him
there,
then
he
would
have
conflict.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
there
was
an
arrangement
that
there
was
to
be
concurring
sentences
that's
in
the
record.
see
that
there
is
a
120
to
123
of
the
appendix
that
this
was
a
recommendation
was
to
get
up
concurrent
sentences
with
a
blocking
all
these
cases.
now.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
oh,
yes!
mr.
john
d.
labelle
judge
demon
was
not
bound
by
it
of
course.
but
it
is
significant
that
on
june
16th,
when
dukes
is
sentenced
in
the
narcotics
case.
he
got
the
judge
devon
filed
the
recommendation.
now
on
june
16,
its
significant
that
there
was
nothing
before
judge
devon
to
remind
him
about
the
dukes
being
involved
with
the
girls.
it
wasn't
in
the
probation
report,
the
dukes
probation
report,
it
wasn't
mentioned?
nobody
mentioned
it
to
judge
devon
and
now
counsel
says,
"what
judge
devon
heard
in
two
weeks
ago,
he
probably
remembers
it."
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes,
it
did.
and
on
june
16
-
mr.
john
d.
labelle
no,
because
we
never
brought
those
cases
up
to
judge
devon
for
disposition.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
i
did
that
afterwards
because
on
june
16th,
dukes
refused
to
plead
to
the
cases
that
where
being
consolidated,
and
refused
to
plead
anything
else.
he
changed
his
mind.
then
judge
devon
he
ask
that
had
his
case
postponed
and
i
use
to
have
a
chance
to
get
new
counsel,
and
judge
devon
said,
you
had
a
whole
month
to
make
up
your
mind
about
this,
since
may
16th
to
june
16th,
you
haven't
done
anything
about
it?
this
is
simply
a
ploy
to
get
delaying
your
sentencing.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
then
after
the
appeal,
the
direct
appeal
was
finished.
i
now
pass
all
my
other
cases
and
i
asked
each
attorneys
in
fairfield,
new
haven
county
to
null
this.
this
is
after
the
direct
appeal
on
this
case.
this
was
some
2
years
afterwards
i
agree,
but
i
carried
all
our
bargain
completely.
now,
you
must
remember
that
he
took
the
direct
appeal
and
he
never
mentioned
any
conflict
of
interest?
he
had
another
lawyer
at
that
time,
and
he
did
not
mention
conflict
of
interest.
we
brought
it
habeas
corpus
in
federal
court
and
he
did
not
mention
conflict
of
interest?
and
when
you
look
at
the
transcript
in
this
case,
to
the
state
dukes
doesn't
claim
that
mr.
zaccagnino
gave
him
anything
but
good
service.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
plea
bargain
he
got.
if
you
look
at
the
record
in
all
these
cases,
he
got
a
good
result
and
mr.
zaccagnino
did
a
fine
job
for
him.
now,
there
is
the
situation
that
comes
up.
now,
let
me
suggest
other
two
things
why
they
don't
have
in
there
sixth
amendment
violations
or
fourteenth
amendment
violations.
in
the
first
place,
the
reason
is
showing
of
an
antagonistic
interest
between
the
parties
here,
was
represented
by
mr.
zaccagnino
in
the
particular
case,
because
there
was
nothing
to
do
in
the
narcotic
case
to
which
dukes
plead
in
the
sentence
with
the
girls.
they
didn't
appear
with
it,
they
never
appeared
in
it,
and
there
was
no
connection
to
it,
nothing
at
all.
mr.
zaccagnino
never
bargain
off
the
girls
and
saying
that,
i'm
going
to
say
to
dukes,
"if
you
don't
plea
guilty
on
our
narcotics
case,
these
girls
are
going
to
testify
against
you."
that
was
wrong
says
no
by
dukes.
it
was
known
way
back
in
december
that
they
were
going
to
cooperate
in
mr.
zaccagnino
refuse.
but
that
never
came
up.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
right.
now,
that's
very
important
here
on
the
other
element.
if
mr.
dukes
wanted
to
claim
this
conflict
of
interest
on
the
day
he
was
sentenced
on
june
16th,
he
should
have
said
something
to
the
court.
he
asked
for
the
counsel,
he
was
given
plenty
of
opportunities
by
the
judge
to
settle
something.
he
asked
why
he
wanted
another
counsel.
what
was
the
matter
with
mr.
zaccagnino
and
he
never
got
this
out
him?
he
did
ever
say
to
judge
devon,
i
have
bad
day
by
mr.
zaccagnino,
or
any
complain,
and
he
doesn't
complain
toward
to
this
day.
he
didn't
even
in
his
testimony
in
the
habeas
corpus
trial.
now,
aren't
you
fix--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
no,
that
is
not.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
i
don't
know
what
he
meant
by
that,
except
for
the
fact
that
he
had
ask
for
the
other
check
cases
to
be
consolidated
for
fairfield
in
new
haven
county.
that
they
were
going
to.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
he
couldn't
be
because
there
was
never
any
connection.
never
any
connection.
no,
i
wouldn't
do
that
with
mr.
dukes
on
the
cross
examination
in
the
habeas
corpus
and
i
asked
him,
"where
you
talking
about
the
narcotics
case?"
and
he
said,
"well,
i
don't
think
i
couldn't
have
been
looking
at
my
remarks."
but
there
wasn't
any
discussion
[voice
overlaps].
mr.
john
d.
labelle
he
pleaded
guilty
on
the
narcotics
and
the
larceny
case.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
he
never
pleaded
on
the
check
case
and
he
never
was
said
so.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
by
what
he
seems
to
say
but
that
couldn't
[voice
overlaps]
mr.
john
d.
labelle
no,
just
the
narcotics
case.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
he
had
a
agreed
and
then
change
his
mind
the
last
day,
on
june
16th
but
he
don't
say
it.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes.
in
this
whole
case
you'll
see
that
both
mr.
delaney
and
mr.
zaccagnino
were
interested
in
wrapping
up
all
the
charges.
its
indicates
that
the
state's
attorney
was
going
to
recommend
concurrent
sentences
that
appears.
now.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
not
less
than
five
more
than
10
years
on
narcotics
count.
two
years
on
the
larceny
count,
making
effective
sentence
on
not
less
than
five
and
more
than
12.
now,
it's
significant
that
in
the
narcotics
charge.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes
and
with
all
the
other
cases,
we
have
been
nullied.
and
that
seems
what
he
wouldn't
have
got
if
he
had
pleaded
to
all
of
them.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
while,
he
was
the
second
offender
in
on
the
narcotic
case.
it
is
a
mandatory
minimum
of
five
years
and
a
maximum
of
10,
if
he
is
the
first
offender,
and
as
a
second
offender,
that
was
doubled.
so,
he
had
on
the
narcotics
case
along
that
exposure
of
not
less
than
10
or
more
than
20.
and
he
had
an
addition
of
that,
what
could
be
added
on
five
years
more
for
the
larceny.
so,
he
had
an
exposure
at
that
point
when
we
were
going
to
trial
in
the
narcotics
case
of
10
to
20
on
the
narcotics,
if
he
was
convicted
in
the
charge
as
a
second
offender,
plus
the
10
years
on
the
larceny.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
i
have
him
warned
and
i
didn't
charge
him,
because
he
pleaded.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
he
got
five
to
10
and
the
five
was
a
mandatory
minimum
on
the
narcotics
charge
under
our
statute.
on
the
narcotic
charge,
it
was
required
that
he
got
atleast
five,
unless
it
was
suspended.
but
he
has
to
get
five
and
with
this
kind
of
case
of
course,
it
could
be
suspended.
now,
there's
one
other
key
to
these
whole
case,
and
i'm
might
respectful
to
ask
the
court
just
to
bare
with
me.
there
is
a
duty
on
the
partition
here
if
he
was
not
satisfied
with
his
counsel
to
have
told
judge
devon
about
it.
he
didn't
do
that
and
counsel
has
said
for
the
petitioner,
that
he
couldn't
do
that,
because
he
didn't
know
what
dukes
had
said
about
it
or
what
zaccagnino
had
said
about
him
the
day
the
girls
was
sentenced.
nobody
bothered
me
all
through
this
case
but
i
finally
found
it
out
a
few
days
ago.
the
first
place
when
this
habeas
corpus
was
started,
long
after
the
direct
appeal
now,
and
after
federal
habeas
corpus
and
nothing
was
said.
he
started
the
habeas
corpus
from
the
person
and
he
mentioned
the
conflict
of
interest.
well,
i
would
then
have
wonder
how
could
he
hadn't
known
about
that
at
this
time
in
prison.
and
then
right
after
he
started
the
action
and
before
mr.
wade
was
appointed
for
him
under
articles
conviction
proceedings.
he
wrote
a
letter
to
the
clerk
of
the
court.
he
then
give
the
letter
to
the
clerk
of
the
court,
this
is
in
the
files.
he
said,
"would
you
please
send
me
your
transcript
of
what
mr.
zaccagnino
said
about
me
and
the
girl's
case,
said
that
you
would
on
wouldn't
bail
me."
now,
it's
obviously
he
had
ignored
what
they
said
because
he
started
his
habeas
corpus
action
before
this.
because
he
says
in
the
letter,
"i
want
to
use
this
transcript
in
my
habeas
corpus
hearing
that
is
coming
up."
so,
that
made
he
had
to
ignore
about
it
himself.
now,
since
he
have
to
ignore
about
it,
he
must
to
know
about
on
june2nd
and
that's
the
day
on
june
16th,
two
weeks
later,
that
he
knew
about
it,
he
should
have
told
judge
devon,
that
i'm
not
being
properly
represented
because
of
a
conflict
of
interest.
what's
for?
mr.
john
d.
labelle
well
i
agree
your
honor
that
i
said
earlier,
that
i
couldn't
guarantee
you,
is
that
the
problem
when
that
had
happened?
when
i
count
you
at
but
i
finally
found
it.
it
is
on
page
of
163
of
the
appendix
and
i'm
asking
him
about
being
in
court
on
june
2nd.
i
was
trying
to
establish
and
he
must
of
heard
the
girls
when
they're
sentenced.
he
says,
he
was
but
now
listen
to
this,
at
the
top
of
the
page
163.
this
is
his
answer,
"i'm
trying
to
think
of
the
day
that
the
girls
got
sentenced,
because
i
was
not
in
court
the
day
they
got
sentenced.
because
i
knew
and
i
wasn't
in
court
that
specific
day
because,
that's
when
i
was
told
what
was
said
about
me."
so
there
it
is,
that's
the
key
to
the
whole
case.
he
knew
that
he
what
he
was
said
about
him,
he
never
complained,
he
never
troubled
judge
devon
about
it
on
june
16,and
if
he
wanted
to,
he
should
have
raised
it
then
and
he
have
plenty
of
opportunities
because
the
record
in
the
case,
judge
devon
gave
him
every
chance
to
speak,
and
tell
him
what
his
trouble
was.
now
in
his
plea,
that
if
you're
going
to
allege
this
kind
of
a
conflict
of
interest,
there's
a
duty
of
notifying
the
trial
court,
and
give
the
trial
court
a
chance
to
rule
on
it.
here
you
have
what
we're
saying
in
this
case,
if
this
case
is
reversed.
we're
going
to
reverse
judge
devon
for
something
that
he
never
knew
about?
and
for
something
that
he
hasn't
ruled
on
and
he
didn't
know
one
thing
about.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
i
think
so.
you
must
presume
that
if
you
remember
what
happened
two
weeks
before.
i'm
not
sure
of
that.
i
don't
know
that
he
this
was
busy
court.
he
have
a
lot
of
other
cases,
whether
or
not
he
remembered
the
girls
case
that
this
was
the
same
dukes,
i
don't
know.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
no,
it
was
june
16th,
it
was
two
weeks
later
and
a
lot
of
things
happen
in
between.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes,
just
continuance.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
right.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes.
i'm
not
saying
that
judge
devon
may
not
have
remembered.
but
what
is
done
here
if
you
have
this
specifically
called
his
attention,
is
presuming
that
he
took
into
the
consideration
in
sentence
a
dukes
on
the
narcotic
case.
some
other
information
he
had
from
outside
and
you
can't
presume
that
a
trial
judge
is
doing
something
wrong
unless
his
been
notified
about
it.
and
in
this
instance,
judge
devon
certainly
didn't
do
anything
other
than
follow
the
state's
recommendation.
the
agreed
recommendation,
the
plea
bargain
recommendation,
so
that
you
can't
say
that
even
if
you
remember
the
dukes
case.
that
he
had
done
anything
that
was
proper
advice
following
the
recommendation.
he
doesn't
say
one
word
about
in
his
remarks
at
the
time
of
sentencing,
judge
devon
does.
so,
that
the
key
to
the
case
is
that
dukes
knew
about
this
remarks
by
zaccagnino
on
june
2nd
in
the
girls
case.
he
didn't
think
anything
about
it,
or
tell
the
judge
about
it
at
any
time
and
you're
asking
this
court
to
overrule
judge
devon
in
the
matter
that
he
never
had
a
chance
to
rule
on.
when
it
was
never
called
to
his
attention
when
there
was
a
duty
and
on
counsel
and
on
the
petitions,
if
you
want
to
raised
it
to
say
so.
