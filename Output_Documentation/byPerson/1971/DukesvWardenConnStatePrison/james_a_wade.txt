mr.
james
a.
wade
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i
was
intrigued
this
morning
to
hear
the
comments
of
the
court
regarding
the
right
to
counsel
and
the
need
of
counsel
in
the
way
that
cases
and
i'm
like
save
primarily
that
i've
related
to
mr.
wade
that
this
court
didn't
realized.
but
the
reason
i
was
interested
was
that
this
case
i
think
the
issue
raised
herein
focuses
on
the
need
to
have
the
undivided
loyalty
of
counsel
throughout
every
stage
of
criminal
case.
if
i
could
recite
briefly
the
facts
here
and
because
i
feel
the
very
important
to
set
a
proper
framework.
my
client
is
to
do
he
was
arrested
in
hard
of
march
1967
with
charge
of
violation
of
connecticut's
uniform
narcotics
theft.
he
retained
at
hartford
attorney
by
the
name
of
zaccagnino,
who
was
the
senior
partner
in
law
firm
by
the
name
zaccagnino,
linardos
and
delaney
to
represent
him
and
that
office
entered
and
confirmed
appearance
in
the
lower
court
for
preliminary
hearing
on
the
arrest
of
the
charge.
down
may
9,
1967,
when
the
mayor
was
set
down
for
trial
in
the
hartford
superior
court,
mr.
dukes
appeared
with
his
attorney,
mr.
zaccagnino,
and
at
that
time
mr.
zaccagnino
moved
that
he
be
permitted
to
withdraw
from
the
action.
as
counsel
for
dukes'
because
as
he
put
it
to
the
court
at
that
time
he
has
slight
conflict
with
his
client.
in
that
matter
was
argued
by
before
the
trial
judge
at
that
point
and
the
court
denied
the
motion
for
mr.
zaccagnino's
withdrawal
but
continued
the
case
24
hours
to
give
dukes
a
chance
to
get
another
lawyer.
mr.
james
a.
wade
my
judgment
would
be
that
that
he
was
trying
to
convince
dukes
to
plead
guilty
and
that
dukes
didn't
want
to
plead
guilty.
and
that
this
was
conflict
these
are
the
zaccagnino
and
dukes.
i
can't
say
fairly
that
at
that
point
mr.
zaccagnino
was
trying
to
appraised
the
court
but
there
was
some
other
conflict
other
than
that
would
be
my
best
judgment,
unknown
speaker
rehnquist.
in
any
case,
when
my
dukes
left
the
court
room
on
may
19,
he
went
out
the
hallway
of
the
court
and
was
rearrested
by
the
hartford
police
and
taken
to
the
hartford
police
station
on
a
unrelated
charge.
and
he
--
while
he
was
at
the
police
station
took
some
pills
and
became
sick
and
he
was
taken
to
a
hospital
and
stayed
there
for
a
week.
and
then
came
back
in
the
court
on
may
16th
with
mr.
zaccagnino's
law
partner
mr.
delaney
and
at
that
time
entered
a
plea
of
guilty
to
the
narcotics
charge
in
a
minute
to
the
information
charging
into
larceny
receiving
stolen
goods.
at
that
time,
the
trial
judge
made
an
inquiry
about
the
voluntariness
of
the
plea.
the
matter
was
sat
down
for
june
2nd
for
sentencing
but
on
the
2nd
pre-sentence
report
was
not
ready
on
the
dukes
matter
and
so
the
case
was
continued
again.
mr.
zaccagnino
was
in
court
with
his
client
mr.
dukes
for
sentencing
but
it
went
over
another
two
weeks.
but
on
the
second,
mr.
zaccagnino
appeared
before
judge
demon,
the
hartford
superior
court,
with
two
girls
whom
he
was
representing
on
charges
that
were
entirely
unrelated
to
mr.
dukes'
charge.
but
i
might
say
that
mr.
dukes
had
been
arrested
in
that
case
as
a
codefendant
and
was
represented
by
another
hartford
attorney
in
that
case.
mr.
james
a.
wade
no,
that
was
the.
mr.
james
a.
wade
conspiracy
to
take
money
but
is
also
pretense
to
the
check
case,
your
honor.
so
at
the
time
of
sentencing,
the
girls
by
the
way
they
have
said
guilty
earlier
to
the
charge,
mr.
zaccagnino
stood
up
to
make
remarks
on
sentencing
on
the
behalf
of
the
bureaus
and
the
fact
that
goes
for
a
moment
here
to
read
in
page
68
of
the
appendix.
during
a
remarks
on
sentencing,
mr.
zaccagnino
in
speaking
on
behalf
of
the
girls
said,
"that
both
of
them
came
under
the
influence
of
charles
dukes."
now,
how
they
could
get
in
a
position
to
come
under
the
influence
of
somebody
like
him,
that
your
honor
please,
face
the
problem
here
that
i
think
is
the
cause
of
the
whole
situation
and
then
the
last
part
of
the
last
paragraph
there,
"as
the
result
of
their
willingness
to
cooperate
with
the
state
police,
they
can
officially
dope
in
the
making
if
plea."
i
think
your
honors,
since
i
was
on
both
sides
of
the
case
having
been
on
the
other
side
of
the
other
case.
i
can
tell
your
honor
that
with
these
girls
that
because
of
there
refusal,
it
is
not
refusal,
not
to
cooperate
with
dukes
and
to
testify
against
him
that
could
pixilated
him
undertaken
a
plea,
he
will
shortly
been
remove
from
society.
and
on
page
70
of
the
appendix,
once
again
referring
to
the
girls
and
their
cooperation
with
the
police,
mr.
zaccagnino
said
the
court,
"it
is
obvious
in
looking
at
the
report,
who
the
most
capable
person
is
because
he
have
all
the
instruments
with
which
the
dukes
these
girls."
then.
mr.
james
a.
wade
no,
in
this
case
your
honor.
mr.
james
a.
wade
that's
correct.
and
then
on
june
16th,
two
weeks
later,
mr.
zaccagnino
and
dukes
was
back
on
trial,
same
trial
judge,
judge
dillon
would
heard
these
remarks
about
the
girls,
they're
back
infront
of
that
time.
now,
at
this
point
dukes
himself
move
to
court
as
guilty
plea
they
would
make
him
and
he
wanted
to
go
another
lawyer
and
he
did
not
want
mr.
zaccagnino
to
continue
represent
him.
well,
the
court
denied
that
permission
and
ordered
the
case
go
forward
and
they
are
find
him
pose
to
sentence
of
not
less
than
five
but
more
than
10
years
on
mr.
dukes.
now,
is
it
our
contention
to
that
counsel
for
dukes
at
that
time
was
such
as
to
render
the
entire
proceeding
including
the
guilty
plea
invalid.
its
our
contention
that
he
was
denied
the
effect
of
assistance
of
counsel.
mr.
james
a.
wade
no,
not
at
that
point
your
honor.
he
had.
mr.
james
a.
wade
that
was
those
were
later
disposal
of.
if
i'm
not
mistaken.
mr.
james
a.
wade
if
i'm
not
mistaking,
i
think
mr.
labelle
can
verify
this.
i
believe
those
where
denied
at
a
later
date
after
the
plea
on,
after
the
sentencing
of
this
case.
mr.
james
a.
wade
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
a.
wade
no
he
hadn't
pleaded
that
point
you
see.
the
girls
at
that
point
have
said
guilty
but
he
had
not.
i
might
also
point
out
that
there
were
several
case
pending
against
him.
mr.
james
a.
wade
and
most
of
these
other
merits
were
consolidated
a
later
point
and
through
the
state's
attorney
could
advice
him
but
i
think
many
of
them.
mr.
james
a.
wade
no
question
at
this
point.
he
got
the
sentence
that
the
court
strike
that
the
state
and
mr.
zaccagnino
had
bargain
about.
that's
one
thing
that's
pointed
out.
mr.
james
a.
wade
that
i
can't
answer
your
honor.
i
was
permitted
to
those
when
negotiations.
i
was
not
representing
at
that
time
and
i
simply
do
not
know.
mr.
james
a.
wade
yes,
mr.
labelle
is
the
same
prosecutor.
mr.
james
a.
wade
i
would
ask,
i
will
let
mr.
labelle
to
answer
that
unknown
speaker
whether
or
not.
but
i
don't
prove.
mr.
james
a.
wade
well,
i
think
the
differ
mr.
justice
white.
first
reason
i
differ
is
i
don't
think
at
this
point
that
the
laws
we
should
can
appoint
where
negotiations
between
a
prosecutor
and
a
defense
counsel
from
pointing
on
the
court.
mr.
james
a.
wade
well,
this
can.
mr.
james
a.
wade
well,
i
would
differ
the
court
then
to
the
reasoning
of
the
pennsylvania
court
in
commonwealth
against
collin.
that
was
a
situation
where
the
defendant,
codefendants,
represented
by
a
single
counsel
received
after
the
sentence
that
had
been
bargain
for.
but
pennsylvania's
supreme
court
reversed
same
to
date,
the
review
of
the
prejudicial
conflict
of
interest.
they
felt
that
it
headed
all
the
way
back
to
the
guilty
plea
and
decide,
what
is
he
getting
adequate
advice
that
the
time
in
entered
the
guilty
plea.
did
mr.
zaccagnino
have
mr.
dukes'
interest
at
heart?
was
he
giving
him
proper
information?
indeed,
with
another
counsel
who
was
in
there
independently
with
mr.
zaccagnino.
now
look
at
the
evidence
these
girls
might
be
willing
to
give
based
with
the
dukes
and
advice
his
clients
with
the
admission
of
the
evidence
was
either
admissible
or
not
admissible.
i
think
that
your
honor
has
to
look
to
the
fact
that
we're
not
looking
at
the
sentence
here.
we
are
going
back
to
the
guilty
plea
and
question
whether
or
not
at
that
point
he
was
denied
the
effect
of
existence
of
counsel
and
we
submit
that
beyond
the
records
statement
of
mr.
zaccagnino
is
what
manifest
that
conflict
of
interest
that
did
exist.
now,
this
court
is
not
really
spoken
to
this
point
since
1942,
when
a
classic
proceeding
was
handed
at
and
that
was
situation
where
the
defendant
itself
was
an
attorney.
and
there
were
two,
it
was
single
counsel
representing
him
at
another
codefendant
the
defendant
glassier
here
was
a
former
united
states
attorney,
existing
united
states
attorney
charged
with
conspiracy
of
violent
between
before
the
united
states
government.
this
point
and
that
point
was
very
explicit
point
out
that
in
a
formal
proceeding
that
the
defendant
should
have
representing
him,
a
person
whose
interesting
are
untrammeled
by
possible
conflicts
of
interest.
and
the
court
laid
down
a
touchtone
which
the
lower
court
said
well
done
as
far
as
i
can
see.
since
42,
they
laid
down
as
a
touchtone
to
determine
whether
or
not
that
assistance
of
counsel
wasn't
paneled.
was
whether
or
not
it
was
effected
as
it
might
have
been?
was
the
assistance
of
counsel
as
effective
as
it
would
have
been
had
their
not
been
this
conflict.
now,
i
submit
in
this
case
clearly
mr.
zaccagnino's
representation
was
not
as
effective
as
it
might
have
been.
the
obvious
reason
is
that
he
was
appearing
before
a
trial
judge
on
june
2nd,
he
can
blame
upon
hi
client
shoulders,
on
behalf
of
the
girls
saying
that
this
poor
girls
would
let
down
the
fact
of
provision
by
dukes
and
then
two
weeks
later,
he
had
to
appear
before
the
same
judge
and
implore
mercy
for
his
client
whom
the
adjusted
story
in
two
weeks
before.
i've
submitted
the
very
least
of
mr.
zaccagnino
have
credibility
problem
with
the
trial
judge
who
was
sitting
and
listening
to
his
arguments.
mr.
james
a.
wade
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
james
a.
wade
well,
if
that's
the
case
and
mr.
chief
justice,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
arguments
of
counsel
were
meaningless.
mr.
james
a.
wade
yes!
about
his
client.
this
is
the
situation
where
he
was
saying
on
the
behalf
of
another
client.
mr.
james
a.
wade
well,
mr.
chief
justice
if
i
can
answer
that
this
way.
it
seems
to
me
from
a
reading
of
many
cases,
the
lower
court
cases
have
government
issue,
that
they
gone
so
far
to
say
even
if
the
trial
counsel
ignores
one
of
his
clients
and
in
this
situation
where
a
lawyer
representing
two
defendants
get
self
at
sentencing
says
a
nice
things
about
one
individual.
it
doesn't
say
anything
at
all
about
the
other.
the
courts
had
held
that
to
be
conflict
interest
that
the
client
who
receive
no
attention
from
his
lawyers.
he's
not
getting
the
representation
that
he
his
entitled
too.
in
other
words,
it
is
not
as
effective
as
it
might
have
been
had
the
conflict
not
existed.
now,
mr.
labelle
in
his
brief
in
this
court
two
questions
had
raised
that
the
issue
of
prejudice
must
to
show
prejudice.
well,
i
submit
that
because
the
attorney-client
relationship
is
what
it
is
and
that
the
attorney
is
taken
into
the
confidence
of
his
client.
that
it
should
not
be
the
burden
of
the
defendant
here,
in
the
ordinary
sense
to
have
to
show
the
prejudice
that
may
have
resulted.
mr.
justice
white
raised
the
question
whether
or
not
the
sentence
was
the
result
of
a
bargain,
and
then
the
logic
that
forwards
that
is
because
bargain
what
he
is
complaining
about.
but
i
said
earlier,
that
bargain
certainly
wasn't
minding
the
trial
judge.
are
there
permissible
penalties
couldn't
been
hidden
down.
the
whole
question
of
how
the
trial
court
looked
upon
dukes'
before
his
eyes.
it
seems
to
me,
that
something
can't
be
answered
in
this
court
because
we
don't
have
that
trial
wasting
for
us.
mr.
james
a.
wade
zaccagnino.
mr.
james
a.
wade
that's
possible.
and
he
might
have
won
the
trial.
you
have
to
remember
your
honor
that
throughout
this
proceeding,
dukes
have
been
saying
i'm
not
guilty.
i
do
not
want
it
pleading
not
guilty.
i
do
not
want
go
forward.
he
did
it
in
the
first
instance
and
the
original
trial
date,
he
then
plead
guilty.
he
came
back
and
said
i
want
vacate
my
plea.
he
keeps
saying
"i'm
not
guilty."
mr.
james
a.
wade
that's
correct.
mr.
james
a.
wade
in
this
case.
so,
the
girls
have
been
involve
to
dukes
so
over
a
serious
of
events.
the
girls
have
been
arrested
on
a
particular
charge
that
they
were
arrested
on.
but
they
were
cooperating
with
the
police
not
only
on
that
case
but
on
the
one
we
are
now
discussing.
mr.
james
a.
wade
that's
correct.
mr.
james
a.
wade
that's
correct.
when
he
was
doing
as
he
said
he
had
both
sides
of
the
case,
mr.
zaccagnino
did.
so,
he
knew
what
the
girls
was
going
to
say.
he
knew
what
they
are
going
to
testify
to
him
and
how
they
would
be
utilized
by
the
state
in
evidence
against
dukes
of
he
and
his
partner,
mr.
delaney,
kept
trying
to
convince
dukes
to
plead
guilty
because
they
knew
that
these
girls
are
going
to
come
in
and
say
things
about
it
on
this
case.
and
that's
why
as
mr.
zaccagnino
says,
"he
was
capitulated
into
taken
a
plea."
mr.
james
a.
wade
yes,
it
is
my
position
yes
it
is.
mr.
james
a.
wade
yes,
it
is.
mr.
james
a.
wade
yes.
there
is
a
campbell
versus
united
states
the
fourth
circuit
i
believe
it
was
said
there
was
no
distinctions
been
retained
at
appointed
counsel.
that
there
must
not
be
conflict
but
the
conflict
exist
is
not
the
irrelevant
whether
it
is
retained
or
appointed.
mr.
james
a.
wade
alright.
well,
that
can
be
handled
mr.
justice
rehnquist
by
adequate
examination
by
the
trial
court.
but
he
should
point
out
to
the
defendant,
all
the
possible
ramifications
that
that
follows
from
that
and
if
they
once
again
there
is
annoying
intelligent
waiver
of
his
sixth
amendment
rights
to
separate
effected
counsel
then
i
would
submit
the
defendant
can
so
dukes.
mr.
james
a.
wade
well,
in
my
understanding
of
the
criminal
procedures,
if
the
state
is
not
interested
in
convictions.
they
are
interested
in
justice
and
the
state
has
the
same
interest
at
hard
as
the
defense
counsel.
the
truth,
they
are
looking
for
the
truth.
mr.
james
a.
wade
obviously
because
of
the
adversary
state
of
our
law.
but
the
point
is,
is
that
if
the
state
is
concern
only
with
convicting
guilty
persons
and
they
too
are
concern
with
insuring
that
all
of
his
constitutional
rights
are
protected
regardless
of
whether
that
attorney,
that
defense
lawyer,
as
if
you
say
preaching
the
candidates
of
ethics.
that's
a
concern
of
the
state
also,
to
make
sure
that
is
not
being
done
and
therefore
the
trial
judge
who
sits
there,
he's
the
referee
and
even
if
the
state
does
not
raise
it
as
they
probably
would
not
because
of
the
adversary
of
circumstances.
internal
court
has
a
responsibility.
mr.
james
a.
wade
as
mr.
justice
white
said,
in
mcmahon
versus
richardson,
a
year
ago
which
was
a
truly
of
few
cases
involving
guilty
pleas.
at
that
time
he
said
he
would
plead
to
the
trial
courts.
the
responsibility
of
insuring
the
standards
of
confidence
of
trial
attorney
representing
the
defendants
before
the
courts
of
the
various
states.
mr.
james
a.
wade
i
think.
mr.
james
a.
wade
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
james
a.
wade
well,
i
think
you
have
to
take
on
a
case
like
this.
mr.
james
a.
wade
in
that
situation?
mr.
james
a.
wade
where
the
--
i
think
that
if
the
defense
counsel
is
incompetent
and
it
is
before
the
trial
judge.
mr.
james
a.
wade
well,
i
think
the
trial
judge
[voice
overlap]
mr.
james
a.
wade
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
james
a.
wade
who?
mr.
james
a.
wade
well,
all
i
can
say
in
response
to
that
is
like,
i
try
to
this
law
firm
that
has
some
35
lawyers
in
it.
but
on
that
number,
i'd
say
30
have
not
been
in
a
trial
court
since
they
pass
the
bar
exam.
they
are
simple
not
trail
lawyers.
they
don't
handle
criminal
defense
cases.
mr.
james
a.
wade
well,
all
i
can
say
is.
mr.
james
a.
wade
no,
he
may
not
do
that.
he
might
decide
that
public
defenders
are
should
be
there
in
the
case.
mr.
james
a.
wade
that's
correct.
mr.
james
a.
wade
if
on
the
facts.
mr.
james
a.
wade
well,
if
on
the
facts,
if
we
have
here.
the
lawyer
is.
mr.
james
a.
wade
yes.
mr.
james
a.
wade
you're
saying
that
where
the
counsel
himself
is
yet
is
incompetent
the
trial
judge
thinks
he
is.
mr.
james
a.
wade
yes,
i
would
submit
that
he
has
a
duty
to
ensure
that
he
is
getting
fair
and
adequate
representation.
that's
effective
representation.
mr.
james
a.
wade
well,
i
think
at
some
part
we
have
to
add
somewhere
there
who's
going
to
argue.
mr.
james
a.
wade
yes.
all
i
can
is
that.
mr.
james
a.
wade
no,
no!
far
from
that.
mr.
james
a.
wade
all
i'm
saying,
he
is
very
competent
lawyer.
all
i'm
saying
is
in
this
case,
he
had
a
conflict
of
interest.
that
destroys
his
effectiveness,
not
that
his
incompetent
but
his
effective
assistance
of
counsel
went
out
the
window
when
he
had
the
interest
of
these
girls
crimple
the
interest
of
his
own
client,
mr.
dukes.
how
could
he,
mr.
zaccagnino
stand
up
and
laid
his
burden
to
blame
on
the
man
that
he
himself
was
to
suppose
to
represent.
that's
all
i'm
saying
in
this
situation.
mr.
james
a.
wade
well,
i
don't
think
the
constitutional
claim
because
i
don't
think
the
sixth
amendment
protection
there
would
apply.
simply
because
the
sixth
amendment
guarantees
as
i
understand
it
is
intended
to
protect
a
citizen
from
activities
by
the
state
against
him.
so,
in
the
civil
claim
they
are
the
client
might
have
a
civil
remedy
against
his
attorney
assuming
he
could
show
some
sort
of
activity
on
his
part
that
down
graded
his
own
case
and
hereby
remove
the
attorney
from
a
superior
proper
representation.
mr.
james
a.
wade
no,
i
don't
think
it
would
be
sufficient
state
action
there
in
order
to
bring
it
and
that
would
be
my
opinion.
i
have
no
law
to
support
that
and
i
don't
think
that
there
be
a
sufficient
state
action,
simply
because
the
state
permitted
its
facilities
to
be
utilized
and
its
judge
to
hear
the
matter
to
raise
a
due
process
argument
on
that
situation.
now,
mr.
labelle
and
his
brief
has
also
raise
the
issue
that
types
of
conflicts
that
might
exist
and
that
the
true
conflict
of
interest
cases
arises
whether
at
the
same
defendants
being
represented
of
the
same
arrest.
while
i
submit
it
to
the
court
cases
in
which
its
been
held
that
simply
isn't
true.
there
is
a
situations
where
a
lawyer
has
represented
a
defendant
in
a
burglary
case
and
quite
parenthetic
that
he
represented
the
victim
of
the
burglary
an
entirely
unrelated
civil
transaction
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
particular
burglary
in
question,
and
there
the
court
held
that
that
was
a
conflict
of
interest
to
that
lawyer
to
be
in
that
case
representing
this
particular
criminal
defendant
when
he
had
represented
the
victim
of
the
burglary
elsewhere.
mr.
james
a.
wade
yes.
relying
on
balasic,
the
fact
with
the
assistance
to
counsel
once
began
sixth
amendment
right.
assumingly
this
is
case
i
decided
ken
against,
whitaker
against
the
state
of,
excuse
me.
in
which
the
defendant
was
charge
of
statutory
rape
and
the
complainant
was
the
mother
of
the
girl
from
a
separate
marriage,
previous
marriage.
she
brought
complain
against
her
own
husband.
having
done
so,
she
went
and
hired
a
lawyer
and
out
of
hers
is
going
to
pay
the
lawyer's
fee.
they
went
to
the
lawyer
and
they
said
"look
we
want
this
case
taken
care
of
us
quickly
and
as
quietly
as
possible
with
no
fuss."
the
lawyers
said
"fine"
took
his
retainer
and
appear
in
a
criminal
action
and
plead
the
man
guilty
of
at
the
time
of
sentencing
there
was,
he
said
virtually
nothing
about
his
reported
client.
it
was
not
who
hadn't
hired
it.
they
report
once
again
so
that
the
lawyer
was
looking
to
another
interest
other
than
his
own
client
for
his
retainer
for
his
responsibility
for
his
duty.
obviously
in
the
whitaker
case,
the
lawyer
was
doing
what
his
retainer
has
tell
him
to
do.
handle
it
quickly
and
quietly
with
no
fuss.
but
that
isn't
the
point,
the
point
is
the
defendant
is
entitle
to
representation
this
of
being
himself
because
he
is
the
one
who
stands
before
the
bar
of
the
state.
but
the
state
bringing
in
action
against
him.
he
starts
answerable
to
his
wife
in
the
criminal
sense.
he
is
answerable
to
the
state
and
in
criminal
sense.
mr.
james
a.
wade
that
possibility
does
exist.
i
don't
quarrel
with
that,
and
it
happens
frequently
in
the
civil
side
obviously,
when
civil
litigation
takes
place
and
a
child
is
say
injured
in
a
automobile
accident.
then
a
guardian
had
likely
disappointed
for
the
child,
and
not
infrequently,
if
one
of
the
defendants
happens
to
be
a
parent,
then
that
child
has
a
particular
financial
interest
that
is
represented
throughout.
indeed,
under
our
practice
in
connecticut
probate
for
has
to
be
intervening
in
cases
of
settlements
about
certain
figures
to
ensure
that
the
settlement
is
proper.
so,
it
is
a
possibility
that
in
a
juvenile
action,
the
court
would
have
to
scrutinize
with
more
care
to
make
sure
that
conflict
does
not
pressed.
mr.
james
a.
wade
very
clearly,
i
don't
quarrel
that
at
all.
but
as
i
said
earlier,
this
court
has
not
really
dealt
with
this
subject
since
1942.
all
the
case
laws.
mr.
james
a.
wade
oh.
yes.
we
don't
quarrel
with
that.
mr.
james
a.
wade
yes.
mr.
james
a.
wade
no,
no.
he
wanted
him
to
get
out.
at
that
time,
dukes
was
saying,
i
don't
want
mr.
zaccagnino,
he
stood
up
on
open
court
and
said
it
himself.
i
want
another
lawyer,
and
the
trial
judge.
mr.
james
a.
wade
right!
he
said,
"i'll
give
you
24
hours
to
get
another
lawyer.
but
we're
ready
to
start
this
case
tomorrow
morning."
that's
when
dukes
went
out,
one
on
his
way
to
get
another
lawyer
and
rounded
back
in
the
hartford
jail
on
another
arrest.
you
see
and
so,
that's
the
key
here
is
that.
mr.
james
a.
wade
yes.
that's
correct.
and
in
fairness
of
the
state
and
mr.
zaccagnino,
i
don't
believe
at
that
point
he
was
trying
to
say
that
court,
"i
have
this
conflict
event
these
two
girls."
i
think
what
he
was
trying
to
say
was
that,
"my
client
and
i
are
arguing
over
whether
you
should
plead
guilty
and
therefore
he
wants
me
out
of
the
case."
mr.
james
a.
wade
no,
i
don't
believe
so
because
my,
this
is
not
on
the
record
of
course,
but
the
money
have
been
paid.
dukes
had
paid
his
fee.
mr.
james
a.
wade
by
himself.
mr.
james
a.
wade
i
have
no
knowledge
of
that.
in
summary,
what
i
would
urge
upon
this
court
is
that
if
as
you
said
this
morning
that
the
right
to
counsel
in
the
duties
of
counsel
are
important
throughout
every
stage
of
criminal
case.
but
we
have
missing
in
this
case,
was
that
very
important
element.
we
have
a
lawyer
who
did
not
have
his
own
and
exclusive,
his
own
client's
and
his
exclusive
heart.
he
had
the
interest
of
another
client
in
there
and
to
me,
this
is
a
clear
case
of
the
conflict
of
interest
of
this
court
may
ever
see.
i
can't
concede
of
the
situation
where
on
the
record.
you'll
have
a
lawyer,
in
one
case
standing
up
before
the
trial
judge
and
pinning
the
blame
on
his
own
client
with
another
action
because
of
the
conduct
of
another
client.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
this
court
in
this
case,
finds
no
conflict
of
interest,
then
in
need
no
case
would
you
ever
find
the
conflict
of
interest.
and
therefore,
we
would
urge
that
the
guilty
plea
that
mr.
dukes
has
entered
be
set
aside
and
to
matter
be
remanded
back
to
the
state
court
for
whatever
proceedings
are
appropriate.
mr.
james
a.
wade
yes,
mr.
chief
justice
if
i
just
address
myself
to
remarks
that
mr.
labelle
raised.
the
first
is
that
he
said
everything
was
in
the
pre-sentence
report
and
judge
devon
had
them
all
before
many
way
and
so
what
difference
that
it
make
with
mr.
zaccagnino
said.
i
say
in
response
to
that,
"that's
when
you
need
your
own
lawyer."
he's
got
an
information
before
him.
you
should
have
your
own
lawyer
there,
who
is
atleast
answering
those
charges
and
pre-sentence
report
to
the
trial
judge.
and
that
mr.
zaccagnino
did
not
do
indeed.
what
he
do
was
compound
them.
the
second
letter.
mr.
james
a.
wade
no,
i
don't
claim
that
at
all.
what
i'm
saying
-
mr.
james
a.
wade
what
i'm
saying,
obviously,
is
that
the
pennsylvania
court
said,
"you've
got
to
go
back
to
the
date
of
the
guilty
plea
itself."
would
they
only
type
of
advice
that
the
defendant
was
getting
from
his
lawyer
at
that
point,
not
at
the
time
of
sentencing.
the
time
of
sentencing
is
merely
symptomatic.
what
happened
two
weeks
earlier,
when
by
mr.
zaccagnino
is
on
a
mission
and
mr.
delaney
is
on
admission,
they
were
working
on
dukes
to
convince
him
to
plea.
but
dukes
keeps
on
saying,
i
don't
want
to
plea,
i'm
not
guilty.
and
so
here
was
a
lawyer
who
did
not
have
the
exclusive
interest
of
that
individual
at
heart
but
instead,
was
pressing
for
some
other
reason
form
to
plea.
so,
i
will
submit
that
the
court
has
to
look
carefully
at
the
present
to
be
creative.
if
you
do
not
find
the
conflict
of
interest
in
this
case.
mr.
james
a.
wade
his
cognitive
about
it
at
the
time
of
habeas
hearing
there
was
on
the
record
examination.
but
trial
judge
a
habeas
hearing
us
to
the
implications
of
seeking
to
have
his
guilty
plea
overturn.
and
i
have
talked
to
him
about
this
as
well
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
a.
wade
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i
was
intrigued
this
morning
to
hear
the
comments
of
the
court
regarding
the
right
to
counsel
and
the
need
of
counsel
in
the
way
that
cases
and
i'm
like
save
primarily
that
i've
related
to
mr.
wade
that
this
court
didn't
realized.
but
the
reason
i
was
interested
was
that
this
case
i
think
the
issue
raised
herein
focuses
on
the
need
to
have
the
undivided
loyalty
of
counsel
throughout
every
stage
of
criminal
case.
if
i
could
recite
briefly
the
facts
here
and
because
i
feel
the
very
important
to
set
a
proper
framework.
my
client
is
to
do
he
was
arrested
in
hard
of
march
1967
with
charge
of
violation
of
connecticut's
uniform
narcotics
theft.
he
retained
at
hartford
attorney
by
the
name
of
zaccagnino,
who
was
the
senior
partner
in
law
firm
by
the
name
zaccagnino,
linardos
and
delaney
to
represent
him
and
that
office
entered
and
confirmed
appearance
in
the
lower
court
for
preliminary
hearing
on
the
arrest
of
the
charge.
down
may
9,
1967,
when
the
mayor
was
set
down
for
trial
in
the
hartford
superior
court,
mr.
dukes
appeared
with
his
attorney,
mr.
zaccagnino,
and
at
that
time
mr.
zaccagnino
moved
that
he
be
permitted
to
withdraw
from
the
action.
as
counsel
for
dukes'
because
as
he
put
it
to
the
court
at
that
time
he
has
slight
conflict
with
his
client.
in
that
matter
was
argued
by
before
the
trial
judge
at
that
point
and
the
court
denied
the
motion
for
mr.
zaccagnino's
withdrawal
but
continued
the
case
24
hours
to
give
dukes
a
chance
to
get
another
lawyer.
mr.
james
a.
wade
my
judgment
would
be
that
that
he
was
trying
to
convince
dukes
to
plead
guilty
and
that
dukes
didn't
want
to
plead
guilty.
and
that
this
was
conflict
these
are
the
zaccagnino
and
dukes.
i
can't
say
fairly
that
at
that
point
mr.
zaccagnino
was
trying
to
appraised
the
court
but
there
was
some
other
conflict
other
than
that
would
be
my
best
judgment,
unknown
speaker
rehnquist.
in
any
case,
when
my
dukes
left
the
court
room
on
may
19,
he
went
out
the
hallway
of
the
court
and
was
rearrested
by
the
hartford
police
and
taken
to
the
hartford
police
station
on
a
unrelated
charge.
and
he
--
while
he
was
at
the
police
station
took
some
pills
and
became
sick
and
he
was
taken
to
a
hospital
and
stayed
there
for
a
week.
and
then
came
back
in
the
court
on
may
16th
with
mr.
zaccagnino's
law
partner
mr.
delaney
and
at
that
time
entered
a
plea
of
guilty
to
the
narcotics
charge
in
a
minute
to
the
information
charging
into
larceny
receiving
stolen
goods.
at
that
time,
the
trial
judge
made
an
inquiry
about
the
voluntariness
of
the
plea.
the
matter
was
sat
down
for
june
2nd
for
sentencing
but
on
the
2nd
pre-sentence
report
was
not
ready
on
the
dukes
matter
and
so
the
case
was
continued
again.
mr.
zaccagnino
was
in
court
with
his
client
mr.
dukes
for
sentencing
but
it
went
over
another
two
weeks.
but
on
the
second,
mr.
zaccagnino
appeared
before
judge
demon,
the
hartford
superior
court,
with
two
girls
whom
he
was
representing
on
charges
that
were
entirely
unrelated
to
mr.
dukes'
charge.
but
i
might
say
that
mr.
dukes
had
been
arrested
in
that
case
as
a
codefendant
and
was
represented
by
another
hartford
attorney
in
that
case.
mr.
james
a.
wade
no,
that
was
the.
mr.
james
a.
wade
conspiracy
to
take
money
but
is
also
pretense
to
the
check
case,
your
honor.
so
at
the
time
of
sentencing,
the
girls
by
the
way
they
have
said
guilty
earlier
to
the
charge,
mr.
zaccagnino
stood
up
to
make
remarks
on
sentencing
on
the
behalf
of
the
bureaus
and
the
fact
that
goes
for
a
moment
here
to
read
in
page
68
of
the
appendix.
during
a
remarks
on
sentencing,
mr.
zaccagnino
in
speaking
on
behalf
of
the
girls
said,
"that
both
of
them
came
under
the
influence
of
charles
dukes."
now,
how
they
could
get
in
a
position
to
come
under
the
influence
of
somebody
like
him,
that
your
honor
please,
face
the
problem
here
that
i
think
is
the
cause
of
the
whole
situation
and
then
the
last
part
of
the
last
paragraph
there,
"as
the
result
of
their
willingness
to
cooperate
with
the
state
police,
they
can
officially
dope
in
the
making
if
plea."
i
think
your
honors,
since
i
was
on
both
sides
of
the
case
having
been
on
the
other
side
of
the
other
case.
i
can
tell
your
honor
that
with
these
girls
that
because
of
there
refusal,
it
is
not
refusal,
not
to
cooperate
with
dukes
and
to
testify
against
him
that
could
pixilated
him
undertaken
a
plea,
he
will
shortly
been
remove
from
society.
and
on
page
70
of
the
appendix,
once
again
referring
to
the
girls
and
their
cooperation
with
the
police,
mr.
zaccagnino
said
the
court,
"it
is
obvious
in
looking
at
the
report,
who
the
most
capable
person
is
because
he
have
all
the
instruments
with
which
the
dukes
these
girls."
then.
mr.
james
a.
wade
no,
in
this
case
your
honor.
mr.
james
a.
wade
that's
correct.
and
then
on
june
16th,
two
weeks
later,
mr.
zaccagnino
and
dukes
was
back
on
trial,
same
trial
judge,
judge
dillon
would
heard
these
remarks
about
the
girls,
they're
back
infront
of
that
time.
now,
at
this
point
dukes
himself
move
to
court
as
guilty
plea
they
would
make
him
and
he
wanted
to
go
another
lawyer
and
he
did
not
want
mr.
zaccagnino
to
continue
represent
him.
well,
the
court
denied
that
permission
and
ordered
the
case
go
forward
and
they
are
find
him
pose
to
sentence
of
not
less
than
five
but
more
than
10
years
on
mr.
dukes.
now,
is
it
our
contention
to
that
counsel
for
dukes
at
that
time
was
such
as
to
render
the
entire
proceeding
including
the
guilty
plea
invalid.
its
our
contention
that
he
was
denied
the
effect
of
assistance
of
counsel.
mr.
james
a.
wade
no,
not
at
that
point
your
honor.
he
had.
mr.
james
a.
wade
that
was
those
were
later
disposal
of.
if
i'm
not
mistaken.
mr.
james
a.
wade
if
i'm
not
mistaking,
i
think
mr.
labelle
can
verify
this.
i
believe
those
where
denied
at
a
later
date
after
the
plea
on,
after
the
sentencing
of
this
case.
mr.
james
a.
wade
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
a.
wade
no
he
hadn't
pleaded
that
point
you
see.
the
girls
at
that
point
have
said
guilty
but
he
had
not.
i
might
also
point
out
that
there
were
several
case
pending
against
him.
mr.
james
a.
wade
and
most
of
these
other
merits
were
consolidated
a
later
point
and
through
the
state's
attorney
could
advice
him
but
i
think
many
of
them.
mr.
james
a.
wade
no
question
at
this
point.
he
got
the
sentence
that
the
court
strike
that
the
state
and
mr.
zaccagnino
had
bargain
about.
that's
one
thing
that's
pointed
out.
mr.
james
a.
wade
that
i
can't
answer
your
honor.
i
was
permitted
to
those
when
negotiations.
i
was
not
representing
at
that
time
and
i
simply
do
not
know.
mr.
james
a.
wade
yes,
mr.
labelle
is
the
same
prosecutor.
mr.
james
a.
wade
i
would
ask,
i
will
let
mr.
labelle
to
answer
that
unknown
speaker
whether
or
not.
but
i
don't
prove.
mr.
james
a.
wade
well,
i
think
the
differ
mr.
justice
white.
first
reason
i
differ
is
i
don't
think
at
this
point
that
the
laws
we
should
can
appoint
where
negotiations
between
a
prosecutor
and
a
defense
counsel
from
pointing
on
the
court.
mr.
james
a.
wade
well,
this
can.
mr.
james
a.
wade
well,
i
would
differ
the
court
then
to
the
reasoning
of
the
pennsylvania
court
in
commonwealth
against
collin.
that
was
a
situation
where
the
defendant,
codefendants,
represented
by
a
single
counsel
received
after
the
sentence
that
had
been
bargain
for.
but
pennsylvania's
supreme
court
reversed
same
to
date,
the
review
of
the
prejudicial
conflict
of
interest.
they
felt
that
it
headed
all
the
way
back
to
the
guilty
plea
and
decide,
what
is
he
getting
adequate
advice
that
the
time
in
entered
the
guilty
plea.
did
mr.
zaccagnino
have
mr.
dukes'
interest
at
heart?
was
he
giving
him
proper
information?
indeed,
with
another
counsel
who
was
in
there
independently
with
mr.
zaccagnino.
now
look
at
the
evidence
these
girls
might
be
willing
to
give
based
with
the
dukes
and
advice
his
clients
with
the
admission
of
the
evidence
was
either
admissible
or
not
admissible.
i
think
that
your
honor
has
to
look
to
the
fact
that
we're
not
looking
at
the
sentence
here.
we
are
going
back
to
the
guilty
plea
and
question
whether
or
not
at
that
point
he
was
denied
the
effect
of
existence
of
counsel
and
we
submit
that
beyond
the
records
statement
of
mr.
zaccagnino
is
what
manifest
that
conflict
of
interest
that
did
exist.
now,
this
court
is
not
really
spoken
to
this
point
since
1942,
when
a
classic
proceeding
was
handed
at
and
that
was
situation
where
the
defendant
itself
was
an
attorney.
and
there
were
two,
it
was
single
counsel
representing
him
at
another
codefendant
the
defendant
glassier
here
was
a
former
united
states
attorney,
existing
united
states
attorney
charged
with
conspiracy
of
violent
between
before
the
united
states
government.
this
point
and
that
point
was
very
explicit
point
out
that
in
a
formal
proceeding
that
the
defendant
should
have
representing
him,
a
person
whose
interesting
are
untrammeled
by
possible
conflicts
of
interest.
and
the
court
laid
down
a
touchtone
which
the
lower
court
said
well
done
as
far
as
i
can
see.
since
42,
they
laid
down
as
a
touchtone
to
determine
whether
or
not
that
assistance
of
counsel
wasn't
paneled.
was
whether
or
not
it
was
effected
as
it
might
have
been?
was
the
assistance
of
counsel
as
effective
as
it
would
have
been
had
their
not
been
this
conflict.
now,
i
submit
in
this
case
clearly
mr.
zaccagnino's
representation
was
not
as
effective
as
it
might
have
been.
the
obvious
reason
is
that
he
was
appearing
before
a
trial
judge
on
june
2nd,
he
can
blame
upon
hi
client
shoulders,
on
behalf
of
the
girls
saying
that
this
poor
girls
would
let
down
the
fact
of
provision
by
dukes
and
then
two
weeks
later,
he
had
to
appear
before
the
same
judge
and
implore
mercy
for
his
client
whom
the
adjusted
story
in
two
weeks
before.
i've
submitted
the
very
least
of
mr.
zaccagnino
have
credibility
problem
with
the
trial
judge
who
was
sitting
and
listening
to
his
arguments.
mr.
james
a.
wade
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
james
a.
wade
well,
if
that's
the
case
and
mr.
chief
justice,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
arguments
of
counsel
were
meaningless.
mr.
james
a.
wade
yes!
about
his
client.
this
is
the
situation
where
he
was
saying
on
the
behalf
of
another
client.
mr.
james
a.
wade
well,
mr.
chief
justice
if
i
can
answer
that
this
way.
it
seems
to
me
from
a
reading
of
many
cases,
the
lower
court
cases
have
government
issue,
that
they
gone
so
far
to
say
even
if
the
trial
counsel
ignores
one
of
his
clients
and
in
this
situation
where
a
lawyer
representing
two
defendants
get
self
at
sentencing
says
a
nice
things
about
one
individual.
it
doesn't
say
anything
at
all
about
the
other.
the
courts
had
held
that
to
be
conflict
interest
that
the
client
who
receive
no
attention
from
his
lawyers.
he's
not
getting
the
representation
that
he
his
entitled
too.
in
other
words,
it
is
not
as
effective
as
it
might
have
been
had
the
conflict
not
existed.
now,
mr.
labelle
in
his
brief
in
this
court
two
questions
had
raised
that
the
issue
of
prejudice
must
to
show
prejudice.
well,
i
submit
that
because
the
attorney-client
relationship
is
what
it
is
and
that
the
attorney
is
taken
into
the
confidence
of
his
client.
that
it
should
not
be
the
burden
of
the
defendant
here,
in
the
ordinary
sense
to
have
to
show
the
prejudice
that
may
have
resulted.
mr.
justice
white
raised
the
question
whether
or
not
the
sentence
was
the
result
of
a
bargain,
and
then
the
logic
that
forwards
that
is
because
bargain
what
he
is
complaining
about.
but
i
said
earlier,
that
bargain
certainly
wasn't
minding
the
trial
judge.
are
there
permissible
penalties
couldn't
been
hidden
down.
the
whole
question
of
how
the
trial
court
looked
upon
dukes'
before
his
eyes.
it
seems
to
me,
that
something
can't
be
answered
in
this
court
because
we
don't
have
that
trial
wasting
for
us.
mr.
james
a.
wade
zaccagnino.
mr.
james
a.
wade
that's
possible.
and
he
might
have
won
the
trial.
you
have
to
remember
your
honor
that
throughout
this
proceeding,
dukes
have
been
saying
i'm
not
guilty.
i
do
not
want
it
pleading
not
guilty.
i
do
not
want
go
forward.
he
did
it
in
the
first
instance
and
the
original
trial
date,
he
then
plead
guilty.
he
came
back
and
said
i
want
vacate
my
plea.
he
keeps
saying
"i'm
not
guilty."
mr.
james
a.
wade
that's
correct.
mr.
james
a.
wade
in
this
case.
so,
the
girls
have
been
involve
to
dukes
so
over
a
serious
of
events.
the
girls
have
been
arrested
on
a
particular
charge
that
they
were
arrested
on.
but
they
were
cooperating
with
the
police
not
only
on
that
case
but
on
the
one
we
are
now
discussing.
mr.
james
a.
wade
that's
correct.
mr.
james
a.
wade
that's
correct.
when
he
was
doing
as
he
said
he
had
both
sides
of
the
case,
mr.
zaccagnino
did.
so,
he
knew
what
the
girls
was
going
to
say.
he
knew
what
they
are
going
to
testify
to
him
and
how
they
would
be
utilized
by
the
state
in
evidence
against
dukes
of
he
and
his
partner,
mr.
delaney,
kept
trying
to
convince
dukes
to
plead
guilty
because
they
knew
that
these
girls
are
going
to
come
in
and
say
things
about
it
on
this
case.
and
that's
why
as
mr.
zaccagnino
says,
"he
was
capitulated
into
taken
a
plea."
mr.
james
a.
wade
yes,
it
is
my
position
yes
it
is.
mr.
james
a.
wade
yes,
it
is.
mr.
james
a.
wade
yes.
there
is
a
campbell
versus
united
states
the
fourth
circuit
i
believe
it
was
said
there
was
no
distinctions
been
retained
at
appointed
counsel.
that
there
must
not
be
conflict
but
the
conflict
exist
is
not
the
irrelevant
whether
it
is
retained
or
appointed.
mr.
james
a.
wade
alright.
well,
that
can
be
handled
mr.
justice
rehnquist
by
adequate
examination
by
the
trial
court.
but
he
should
point
out
to
the
defendant,
all
the
possible
ramifications
that
that
follows
from
that
and
if
they
once
again
there
is
annoying
intelligent
waiver
of
his
sixth
amendment
rights
to
separate
effected
counsel
then
i
would
submit
the
defendant
can
so
dukes.
mr.
james
a.
wade
well,
in
my
understanding
of
the
criminal
procedures,
if
the
state
is
not
interested
in
convictions.
they
are
interested
in
justice
and
the
state
has
the
same
interest
at
hard
as
the
defense
counsel.
the
truth,
they
are
looking
for
the
truth.
mr.
james
a.
wade
obviously
because
of
the
adversary
state
of
our
law.
but
the
point
is,
is
that
if
the
state
is
concern
only
with
convicting
guilty
persons
and
they
too
are
concern
with
insuring
that
all
of
his
constitutional
rights
are
protected
regardless
of
whether
that
attorney,
that
defense
lawyer,
as
if
you
say
preaching
the
candidates
of
ethics.
that's
a
concern
of
the
state
also,
to
make
sure
that
is
not
being
done
and
therefore
the
trial
judge
who
sits
there,
he's
the
referee
and
even
if
the
state
does
not
raise
it
as
they
probably
would
not
because
of
the
adversary
of
circumstances.
internal
court
has
a
responsibility.
mr.
james
a.
wade
as
mr.
justice
white
said,
in
mcmahon
versus
richardson,
a
year
ago
which
was
a
truly
of
few
cases
involving
guilty
pleas.
at
that
time
he
said
he
would
plead
to
the
trial
courts.
the
responsibility
of
insuring
the
standards
of
confidence
of
trial
attorney
representing
the
defendants
before
the
courts
of
the
various
states.
mr.
james
a.
wade
i
think.
mr.
james
a.
wade
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
james
a.
wade
well,
i
think
you
have
to
take
on
a
case
like
this.
mr.
james
a.
wade
in
that
situation?
mr.
james
a.
wade
where
the
--
i
think
that
if
the
defense
counsel
is
incompetent
and
it
is
before
the
trial
judge.
mr.
james
a.
wade
well,
i
think
the
trial
judge
[voice
overlap]
mr.
james
a.
wade
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
james
a.
wade
who?
mr.
james
a.
wade
well,
all
i
can
say
in
response
to
that
is
like,
i
try
to
this
law
firm
that
has
some
35
lawyers
in
it.
but
on
that
number,
i'd
say
30
have
not
been
in
a
trial
court
since
they
pass
the
bar
exam.
they
are
simple
not
trail
lawyers.
they
don't
handle
criminal
defense
cases.
mr.
james
a.
wade
well,
all
i
can
say
is.
mr.
james
a.
wade
no,
he
may
not
do
that.
he
might
decide
that
public
defenders
are
should
be
there
in
the
case.
mr.
james
a.
wade
that's
correct.
mr.
james
a.
wade
if
on
the
facts.
mr.
james
a.
wade
well,
if
on
the
facts,
if
we
have
here.
the
lawyer
is.
mr.
james
a.
wade
yes.
mr.
james
a.
wade
you're
saying
that
where
the
counsel
himself
is
yet
is
incompetent
the
trial
judge
thinks
he
is.
mr.
james
a.
wade
yes,
i
would
submit
that
he
has
a
duty
to
ensure
that
he
is
getting
fair
and
adequate
representation.
that's
effective
representation.
mr.
james
a.
wade
well,
i
think
at
some
part
we
have
to
add
somewhere
there
who's
going
to
argue.
mr.
james
a.
wade
yes.
all
i
can
is
that.
mr.
james
a.
wade
no,
no!
far
from
that.
mr.
james
a.
wade
all
i'm
saying,
he
is
very
competent
lawyer.
all
i'm
saying
is
in
this
case,
he
had
a
conflict
of
interest.
that
destroys
his
effectiveness,
not
that
his
incompetent
but
his
effective
assistance
of
counsel
went
out
the
window
when
he
had
the
interest
of
these
girls
crimple
the
interest
of
his
own
client,
mr.
dukes.
how
could
he,
mr.
zaccagnino
stand
up
and
laid
his
burden
to
blame
on
the
man
that
he
himself
was
to
suppose
to
represent.
that's
all
i'm
saying
in
this
situation.
mr.
james
a.
wade
well,
i
don't
think
the
constitutional
claim
because
i
don't
think
the
sixth
amendment
protection
there
would
apply.
simply
because
the
sixth
amendment
guarantees
as
i
understand
it
is
intended
to
protect
a
citizen
from
activities
by
the
state
against
him.
so,
in
the
civil
claim
they
are
the
client
might
have
a
civil
remedy
against
his
attorney
assuming
he
could
show
some
sort
of
activity
on
his
part
that
down
graded
his
own
case
and
hereby
remove
the
attorney
from
a
superior
proper
representation.
mr.
james
a.
wade
no,
i
don't
think
it
would
be
sufficient
state
action
there
in
order
to
bring
it
and
that
would
be
my
opinion.
i
have
no
law
to
support
that
and
i
don't
think
that
there
be
a
sufficient
state
action,
simply
because
the
state
permitted
its
facilities
to
be
utilized
and
its
judge
to
hear
the
matter
to
raise
a
due
process
argument
on
that
situation.
now,
mr.
labelle
and
his
brief
has
also
raise
the
issue
that
types
of
conflicts
that
might
exist
and
that
the
true
conflict
of
interest
cases
arises
whether
at
the
same
defendants
being
represented
of
the
same
arrest.
while
i
submit
it
to
the
court
cases
in
which
its
been
held
that
simply
isn't
true.
there
is
a
situations
where
a
lawyer
has
represented
a
defendant
in
a
burglary
case
and
quite
parenthetic
that
he
represented
the
victim
of
the
burglary
an
entirely
unrelated
civil
transaction
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
particular
burglary
in
question,
and
there
the
court
held
that
that
was
a
conflict
of
interest
to
that
lawyer
to
be
in
that
case
representing
this
particular
criminal
defendant
when
he
had
represented
the
victim
of
the
burglary
elsewhere.
mr.
james
a.
wade
yes.
relying
on
balasic,
the
fact
with
the
assistance
to
counsel
once
began
sixth
amendment
right.
assumingly
this
is
case
i
decided
ken
against,
whitaker
against
the
state
of,
excuse
me.
in
which
the
defendant
was
charge
of
statutory
rape
and
the
complainant
was
the
mother
of
the
girl
from
a
separate
marriage,
previous
marriage.
she
brought
complain
against
her
own
husband.
having
done
so,
she
went
and
hired
a
lawyer
and
out
of
hers
is
going
to
pay
the
lawyer's
fee.
they
went
to
the
lawyer
and
they
said
"look
we
want
this
case
taken
care
of
us
quickly
and
as
quietly
as
possible
with
no
fuss."
the
lawyers
said
"fine"
took
his
retainer
and
appear
in
a
criminal
action
and
plead
the
man
guilty
of
at
the
time
of
sentencing
there
was,
he
said
virtually
nothing
about
his
reported
client.
it
was
not
who
hadn't
hired
it.
they
report
once
again
so
that
the
lawyer
was
looking
to
another
interest
other
than
his
own
client
for
his
retainer
for
his
responsibility
for
his
duty.
obviously
in
the
whitaker
case,
the
lawyer
was
doing
what
his
retainer
has
tell
him
to
do.
handle
it
quickly
and
quietly
with
no
fuss.
but
that
isn't
the
point,
the
point
is
the
defendant
is
entitle
to
representation
this
of
being
himself
because
he
is
the
one
who
stands
before
the
bar
of
the
state.
but
the
state
bringing
in
action
against
him.
he
starts
answerable
to
his
wife
in
the
criminal
sense.
he
is
answerable
to
the
state
and
in
criminal
sense.
mr.
james
a.
wade
that
possibility
does
exist.
i
don't
quarrel
with
that,
and
it
happens
frequently
in
the
civil
side
obviously,
when
civil
litigation
takes
place
and
a
child
is
say
injured
in
a
automobile
accident.
then
a
guardian
had
likely
disappointed
for
the
child,
and
not
infrequently,
if
one
of
the
defendants
happens
to
be
a
parent,
then
that
child
has
a
particular
financial
interest
that
is
represented
throughout.
indeed,
under
our
practice
in
connecticut
probate
for
has
to
be
intervening
in
cases
of
settlements
about
certain
figures
to
ensure
that
the
settlement
is
proper.
so,
it
is
a
possibility
that
in
a
juvenile
action,
the
court
would
have
to
scrutinize
with
more
care
to
make
sure
that
conflict
does
not
pressed.
mr.
james
a.
wade
very
clearly,
i
don't
quarrel
that
at
all.
but
as
i
said
earlier,
this
court
has
not
really
dealt
with
this
subject
since
1942.
all
the
case
laws.
mr.
james
a.
wade
oh.
yes.
we
don't
quarrel
with
that.
mr.
james
a.
wade
yes.
mr.
james
a.
wade
no,
no.
he
wanted
him
to
get
out.
at
that
time,
dukes
was
saying,
i
don't
want
mr.
zaccagnino,
he
stood
up
on
open
court
and
said
it
himself.
i
want
another
lawyer,
and
the
trial
judge.
mr.
james
a.
wade
right!
he
said,
"i'll
give
you
24
hours
to
get
another
lawyer.
but
we're
ready
to
start
this
case
tomorrow
morning."
that's
when
dukes
went
out,
one
on
his
way
to
get
another
lawyer
and
rounded
back
in
the
hartford
jail
on
another
arrest.
you
see
and
so,
that's
the
key
here
is
that.
mr.
james
a.
wade
yes.
that's
correct.
and
in
fairness
of
the
state
and
mr.
zaccagnino,
i
don't
believe
at
that
point
he
was
trying
to
say
that
court,
"i
have
this
conflict
event
these
two
girls."
i
think
what
he
was
trying
to
say
was
that,
"my
client
and
i
are
arguing
over
whether
you
should
plead
guilty
and
therefore
he
wants
me
out
of
the
case."
mr.
james
a.
wade
no,
i
don't
believe
so
because
my,
this
is
not
on
the
record
of
course,
but
the
money
have
been
paid.
dukes
had
paid
his
fee.
mr.
james
a.
wade
by
himself.
mr.
james
a.
wade
i
have
no
knowledge
of
that.
in
summary,
what
i
would
urge
upon
this
court
is
that
if
as
you
said
this
morning
that
the
right
to
counsel
in
the
duties
of
counsel
are
important
throughout
every
stage
of
criminal
case.
but
we
have
missing
in
this
case,
was
that
very
important
element.
we
have
a
lawyer
who
did
not
have
his
own
and
exclusive,
his
own
client's
and
his
exclusive
heart.
he
had
the
interest
of
another
client
in
there
and
to
me,
this
is
a
clear
case
of
the
conflict
of
interest
of
this
court
may
ever
see.
i
can't
concede
of
the
situation
where
on
the
record.
you'll
have
a
lawyer,
in
one
case
standing
up
before
the
trial
judge
and
pinning
the
blame
on
his
own
client
with
another
action
because
of
the
conduct
of
another
client.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
this
court
in
this
case,
finds
no
conflict
of
interest,
then
in
need
no
case
would
you
ever
find
the
conflict
of
interest.
and
therefore,
we
would
urge
that
the
guilty
plea
that
mr.
dukes
has
entered
be
set
aside
and
to
matter
be
remanded
back
to
the
state
court
for
whatever
proceedings
are
appropriate.
mr.
james
a.
wade
yes,
mr.
chief
justice
if
i
just
address
myself
to
remarks
that
mr.
labelle
raised.
the
first
is
that
he
said
everything
was
in
the
pre-sentence
report
and
judge
devon
had
them
all
before
many
way
and
so
what
difference
that
it
make
with
mr.
zaccagnino
said.
i
say
in
response
to
that,
"that's
when
you
need
your
own
lawyer."
he's
got
an
information
before
him.
you
should
have
your
own
lawyer
there,
who
is
atleast
answering
those
charges
and
pre-sentence
report
to
the
trial
judge.
and
that
mr.
zaccagnino
did
not
do
indeed.
what
he
do
was
compound
them.
the
second
letter.
mr.
james
a.
wade
no,
i
don't
claim
that
at
all.
what
i'm
saying
-
mr.
james
a.
wade
what
i'm
saying,
obviously,
is
that
the
pennsylvania
court
said,
"you've
got
to
go
back
to
the
date
of
the
guilty
plea
itself."
would
they
only
type
of
advice
that
the
defendant
was
getting
from
his
lawyer
at
that
point,
not
at
the
time
of
sentencing.
the
time
of
sentencing
is
merely
symptomatic.
what
happened
two
weeks
earlier,
when
by
mr.
zaccagnino
is
on
a
mission
and
mr.
delaney
is
on
admission,
they
were
working
on
dukes
to
convince
him
to
plea.
but
dukes
keeps
on
saying,
i
don't
want
to
plea,
i'm
not
guilty.
and
so
here
was
a
lawyer
who
did
not
have
the
exclusive
interest
of
that
individual
at
heart
but
instead,
was
pressing
for
some
other
reason
form
to
plea.
so,
i
will
submit
that
the
court
has
to
look
carefully
at
the
present
to
be
creative.
if
you
do
not
find
the
conflict
of
interest
in
this
case.
mr.
james
a.
wade
his
cognitive
about
it
at
the
time
of
habeas
hearing
there
was
on
the
record
examination.
but
trial
judge
a
habeas
hearing
us
to
the
implications
of
seeking
to
have
his
guilty
plea
overturn.
and
i
have
talked
to
him
about
this
as
well
mr.
chief
justice.
