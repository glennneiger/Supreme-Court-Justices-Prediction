do
i
gather
the
issue
here,
that
was
not
whether
the
children
must
go
to
school
rather
than
the
issue
whether
the
parents
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
must
see
to
it
that
the
children
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
take
it
that
whether
the
issue
constitutionally
at
least,
whether
their
freedom
of
religion
is
violated
by
requiring
them
to
send
the
children?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
as
i
gather,
am
i
wrong,
we
are
not
concerned
here
of
whether
the
children
have
to
go
to
school,
amish
or
not.
we
are
concerned
with
whether
amish
parents
can
be
compelled
under
threat
of
the
criminal
punishment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
does
not
the
state
has
to
show
a
compelling
interest
in
education?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
it
enough
that
there
is
a
compelling
interest
in
education
or
does
it
have
to
be
other
kinds
of
compelling
interests?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
do
not
see
how
any
would
question
that,
since
the
state
has
the
compelling
interest
in
education?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

but
do
you
think
that
answers
the

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i
do
not
think
it
answers
the
question
completely.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
has
to
have
a
compelling
interest
in
total
compliance,
does
it?(voice
overlap)
can
you
demonstrate
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
do
not
–-
does
the
state
challenge
that
this
is
--
their
position
about
education
is
very
often
moot
for
their
religion?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
the
old
polygamy
cases?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
what
we
have
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
wish
it
were.
i
do
not
find
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
how
any
would
challenge
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
take
it
if,
i
think
you
said
earlier
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
douglas’
question
that
the
amish
do
have
their
own
school?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
take
it,
it
is
like
roman
catholic
protestants
or
any
the
other
protestant
schools,
if
the
standards
of
education
in
those
schools
met
the
state’s
standards,
you
would
not
be
here,
would
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
is
it
that
they
will
not
comply
with
the
state
quality
standard,
is
that
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
does
–-
do
the
amish
have
any
formal
schools
in
wisconsin?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
the
quality
of
education
on
those
schools
satisfies
state
standards?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
one
of
those
schools
that
the
attorney
general
has
said
the
amish
have
established
is
where
they
adhere
to
the
state
standards,
is
it
not
correct?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
