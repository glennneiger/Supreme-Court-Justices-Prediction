mr.
john
w.
calhoun
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
respondents,
here
are
members
of
the
old
order
amish
religious
sect.
they
reside
in
green
county
of
southwestern
wisconsin.
in
november
of
1968,
when
they
refused
to
send
their
children
beyond
the
eighth
grade,
a
summon
and
criminal
complaint
was
filed
in
the
county
court
of
green
county.
they
were
tried
on
april
2,
1969
for
violation
of
the
wisconsin
compulsory
school-attendance
law.
the
case
was
tried
to
the
county
court
of
green
county
and
the
respondents
were
found
guilty
there.
they
had
a
trial
de
novo
in
the
circuit
court
of
green
county
where
the
court
again
found
them
guilty
and
imposed
a
minimum
fine
of
$5.00
on
each
of
the
respondents.
they
appealed
to
the
wisconsin
supreme
court.
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
reversed
and
this
court
granted
certiorari
on
may
24th
of
this
year.
respondents
object
to
education
of
the
children
in
public,
private,
secular
or
non-secular
schools
beyond
a
certain
point.
at
present
time,
the
objection
is
eighth
grade.
the
trial
court
noted
the
problem
with
the
arbitrary
eighth
grade
cutoff
in
its
decision.
now,
worried
about
the
decisions
and
opinions
that
were
filed
in
this
case
in
the
courts
below,
the
trial
court
below
found
that
the
compulsory
school
attendance
law
did
interfere
with
the
freedom
of
the
respondents
to
act
in
support
of
their
religious
beliefs.
they
also
found
that
appreciable
numbers
of
the
amish-reared
youth
do
believe
the
faith.
both
the
trial
courts
concluded
after
several
careful
consideration
of
the
cases
that
the
compulsory
school-attendance
laws
in
wisconsin
were
a
reasonable
exercise
of
the
police
power
of
the
state
to
educate
its
youth.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
yes,
that
is
through
a
certain
age.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
yes,
7
through
16.
this
is
pretty
general
throughout
the
rest
of
the
state.
it
is
based
on
age
but
not
on
grade.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
if
he
could
show
achievement
equivalent
to
a
high
school
education
at
any
point,
he
would
be
excused
from
the
compulsory
school
attendance
law.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
yes,
there
is
an
area
of
discretion
there
to
be
exercised
by
the
state
superintendent
of
the
public
instruction,
your
honor
and
this
provides
for
a
certain
unusual
cases
and
of
course
there
are
exemptions
for
a
health
problems
and
handicaps
and
that
sort
of
thing,
but
there
is
no
problem
with
respect
to
the
substantial
equivalency
of
the
education,
the
discretion
resting
with
the
state
superintendent
of
the
public
instruction.
now,
the
opinions
of
the
wisconsin
court
were
three
in
number.
there
is
principal
opinion
which
is
stated
on
page
133
of
the
appendix,
we
view
this
case
as
involving
solely
a
parents’
right
of
religious
freedom
to
bring
up
his
children
as
he
believe
god
dictates.
if
nothing
else,
that
god
dictates
in
an
infinite
variety
of
ways,
this
makes
for
a
thoroughly
broad
issue.
the
concurring
opinion
has
stated
this.
under
the
facts
of
this
case
there
has
been
an
inadequate
showing
that
the
state's
interest
in
establishing
and
maintaining
an
educational
system
overrides
the
defendants’
right
to
the
pre-exercise
of
his
religion.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
we
have
a
vocational
school
situation
in
the
law,
your
honor
which
--
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
yes.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
yes,
that
is
a
rather
elaborate
system
of
vocational
schools
in
wisconsin
and
there
is
a
provision
specifically
for
children
to
attend
the
vocational
school
if
that
vocational
school
is
within
the
school
district
and
the
trial
court
asked
the
same
question
in
this
area
and
was
satisfied
that
the
vocational
school
law
probably
had
no
particular
applications
in
this
case,
although
vocational
school
is
certainly
open
and
available
to
all
people
in
wisconsin.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
the
range
is
very
broad.
now,
the
agricultural
vocational
schools
which
would
probably
interest
the
amish
more
is
handled
through
the
land
grant,
the
old
federal
aid
program
to
agricultural
education
and
that
is
handled
in
the
high
school.
there
is
a
special
agricultural
teacher
who
is
paid
out
of
federal
funds
and
that
has
been
in
existence
for
a
long
time.
so
that
is
available.
there
is
not
any
question
that
these
vocational
programs
are
available
to
respondent.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
do
they
have
private
schools?
yes,
in
many
areas
they
do.
and
in
this
particular
instance
however
they
apparently
refused
to
set
up
any
school
which
goes
beyond
the
eighth
grade.
there
are
no
secondary
schools
in
operation
by
the
amish
in
wisconsin
that
i
know
of.
there
may
be
some
who
have
not
been
approved
by
the
state
superintendent,
but
are
still
in
operation.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
i
think
there
was
not
mr.
justice
blackmun.
there
was
absolutely
no
evidence
of
that
and
in
fact
this
has
been
a
rather
intelligently
and
studiously
tried
case
from
the
beginning.
there
is
a
good
–-
there
are
statements
in
the
record
of
expert
witnesses
speaking
in
favor
of
the
amish.
there
has
been
no
ranker
and
it
has
been
a
most
interesting
case
because
it
has
been
free
of
that
type
of
thing.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
well,
yes,
there
is
a
loss
of
state
aid,
but
that
is
really
insignificant
to
the
issues
involved.
i
do
not
think
that
has
really
anything
to
do
about
that.
the
state
aids
are
very
small
compared
to
the
real
need
of
the
school
district.
now
--
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
yes.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
yes,
it
is
not
a
question
of
children
here.
the
question
of
whether
the
parents
can
be
compelled
to
send
their
children
to
school?
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
we
think
there
are
two
issues
here
really.
first
of
all,
it
is
rather
the
–-
let
me
state
it,
whether
or
not
the
respondents
may
select
the
time,
the
extent
and
whether
or
not
they
will
comply
with
the
compulsory
school-attendance
laws
and
whether
there
is
somewhat
more
broadly
stated
a
constitutional
right
to
conscientiously
object
to
education.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
well,
first
we
are
concerned
about
the
rights
of
the
child
to
an
education.
i
think
we
are
concerned
about
that.
i
do
not
think
we
can
avoid
that
as
an
overriding
issue
and
i
think
the
dissenting
opinion
expressed
that
well,
because
the
compelling
interest
of
the
state
is
in
the
education
of
the
children
and
the
interest
of
the
child
in
education
is
important.
it
is
vital
and
this
is
what
we
think
the
real
issues
are.
now
--
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
is
to
--
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
that
is
right.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
that
is
right,
yes.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
yes.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
well,
that
is
right.
it
is
question
of
whether
or
not
it
complied
with
the
law.
in
this
--
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
yes,
we
think
there
is
a
compelling
interest
in
education.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
no,
i
do
not
think
there
has
to
be
any
other
kind
of
compelling
interest
because
it
is
through
compulsory
education,
compulsory
school
attendance
that
the
interest
is
implemented.
the
interest,
the
subject
we
regulate
is
education.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
yes.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
i
do
not
think
it
answers
the
question
completely.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
no,
i
do
not
think
the
compelling
interest
is
not
in
total
compliance
necessarily.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
court
can
say
that
the
amish
parents
have
a
constitutional
right
to
conscientiously
object
to
education,
to
sending
their
children
to
school.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
what
we
have
said
in
that
is
simply
this;
that
as
the
trial
court
said,
it
interferes
with
their
freedom
to
act
but
not
with
their
religious
belief
as
such
and
that
the
cases
are
clear
and
this
court
has
pronounced
time
and
again
that
the
freedom
to
act
may
be
restricted
in
interpretation
of
the
first
amendment,
but
the
freedom
to
believe
may
not.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
that
is
right.
the
old
morgan
cases,
cantwell
versus
connecticut.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
yes.
yes,
it
is
a
simple
as
that,
it
can
be
decided
that
way.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
what
we
are
saying
here
is
essentially
that
there
is
a
compelling
interest
in
education.
that
is
essentially
our
view,
and
that
this
court
and
the
congress,
people
of
this
country
have
manifested
this
compelling
interest.
the
concurring
opinion
--
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
that
is
right.
i
do
not
either
and
that
is
what
we
find
wrong,
and
this
is
why
we
are
here
because
this
is
what
they
said.
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
there
has
been
an
inadequate
showing
that
the
state’s
interest
in
establishing
and
maintaining
an
educational
system
overrides
defendants’
right
to
the
free
exercise
of
religion.
it
is
just
as
clear
as
that.
it
is
as
clear
as
the
conscientious
subject
of
their
cases.
it
is
as
clear
as
the
statement
in
gillette.
it
is
as
clear
as
ballard
and
seeger.
i
do
not
want
to
equate.
i
do
not
want
to
equate
military
rule
and/or
imply
by
equating
compulsory
education
with
military
conscription
that
the
heavy
hand
of
the
state
is
being
applied
here.
it
is
quite
the
contrary.
the
compulsory
school-attendance
laws
have
been
in
existence
for
years.
they
were
part
of
the
established
church
when
this
country
was
founded
the,
when
the
colonists
established
the
bureaucratic
societies
in
the
pre-revolutionary
days
when
the
church
became
--
this
established
a
compulsory
school-attendance
laws
remained.
they
remained
in
a
democratic
fashion
and
they
are
applied
and
enacted
in
a
democratic
fashion.
when
you
talk
about
sherbert
against
verner
which
is
the
case
in
which
the
respondents
rely,
you
have
an
entirely
different
set
of
values.
you
are
not
talking
in
sherbert
against
verner
about
a
social
institution
of
the
type
of
education,
military
conscription,
and
the
system
of
taxation,
all
of
these
other
things
where
the
legislature
acts
to
grant
the
exemption.
this
is
a
positive
force
that
we
are
dealing
with
for
the
benefit
of
society
and
it
is
the
legislature
that
to
determine
in
its
own
area
of
protection
of
the
liberties
of
this
country.
it
is
the
legislature
that
should
determine
whether
the
compulsory
school-attendance
laws
are
necessary
to
enact
or
to
obtain
the
full
benefit
of
education
to
the
individual
and
society.
at
this
point,
i
think
we
get
through
an
important
area
for
this
court
to
consider.
i
am
sure
that
you
are
aware
of
justice
frankfurter's
opinion
in
minersville
v.
gobitis
and
in
his
dissent
in
west
virginia
against
barnett.
in
these
particular
cases,
he
espoused
the
importance
of
a
legislature
and
it
is
in
this
particular
area,
in
the
area
of
education
where
we
are
talking
in
terms
of
positive
movement
of
more
education
and
not
less
--
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
--
that
the
legislature
has
an
important
function.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
well
--
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
well,
what
cases
in
particular
do
you
have
in
mind?
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
yes,
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
no,
i
think
that
what
--
yes,
i
think
what
the
court
is
–-
i
think
what
we
are
doing
is
opening
up
a
different
approach
to
the
same
argument.
we
will
arrive
at
the
same
conclusion.
as
i
think
justice
white
said,
it
is
our
good
fortune
in
lemon
v.
kurtzman
that
the
states
have
undertaken
to
educate
our
youth
and
to
compel
their
attendance
in
school
by
compulsory
school
attendance.
now,
what
we
are
concerned
about
here
takes
us
to
pierce
against
the
society
of
sisters
of
the
holy
name
where
the
court
said,
that
we
could
not
compel
attendance
at
public
schools,
but
there
was
no
reason
why
attendance
could
not
be
compelled
at
public
or
private,
secular
or
non-secular
schools
and
this
is
not
the
area
when
you
talk
about
age
of
parochial
education
that
we
get
into
it.
we
get
into
a
proposition
that
embraces
to
augment
this
and
that
is
not
really
the
question
here.
the
question
here
is
education
or
no
education?
it
is
not
the
question
of
private
education
or
public
education
or
how
much
one
should
be
aided
over
the
other.
yes,
there
is
a
first
amendment
question,
but
it
is
an
establishment
question
rather
than
a
freedom
to
worship
question.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
yes.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
that
is
right.
we
would
not.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
yes,
they
will
not.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
is
correct,
yes.
they
have
no
schools.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
well,
i
am
not
sure
because
i
am
not
sure
whether
that
would
meet
the
standard.
we
probably
would
not
be
here.
we
might
be
in
some
other
lower
court
determining
whether
there
was
a
reasonable
ruling
by
the
administrative
bodies
that
is
the
department
of
public
instruction
who
are
experts
in
this
area.
but
it
would
not
be
the
same
constitutional
question
that
is
involved
here.
that
i
think
is
safe
to
say
that
we
would
not
be
here.
now
--
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
do
the
amish?
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
yes,
i
think
there
are
some
grade
schools
and
i
believe
they
were
establishing
a
grade
school
in
the
green
county
area.
i
am
not
sure
of
that
but
i
know
there
are
some
schools
that
established
up
in
the
medford
area
in
the
northern
part
of
the
state.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
i
believe
that
those
schools
do
satisfy
state
standards,
although
it
may
be
that
the
superintendent
has
not
made
a
ruling
on
that.
now,
i
have
indicated
that
the
compulsory
school-attendance
law
and
the
ruling
of
the
wisconsin
courts
are
more
properly
analyzed
in
terms
of
the
a
conscientious
objector
cases,
walz,
seeger,
and
gillette.
and
to
this
extent,
the
ruling
of
the
wisconsin
court
does
present
a
constitutional
right
to
anyone
who
has
conscientious
objection
based
on
a
sincere
moral
belief
to
object
to
education.
and
we
submit
that
this
would
raise
have
it
with
the
educational
system
not
only
in
wisconsin,
but
throughout
the
country.
now,
let
us
look
at
the
specific
laws
for
example.
there
is
a
correlation
expressed
in
prince
against
massachusetts,
a
correlation
for
example
between
compulsory
education
and
compulsory
school
attendance
and
the
child
labor
laws.
they
are
integrated.
we
quoted
that
the
child
labor
laws
to
show
them
in
our
brief.
now,
not
only
is
there
a
correlation
there,
but
there
must
be
a
correlation
in
the
whole
program,
the
whole
legislative
program
regarding
children.
the
matter
in
which
a
juvenile
judge
for
example
deals
with
a
dependent
child
would
be
affected
by
the
decision
of
this
court
and
if
it
were
to
say
that
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
conscientiously
object
education,
i
feel
that
it
would
be
removing
a
vital
tool
from
the
administration
of
a
law
as
it
relates
to
youth
and
children.
i
will
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
your
honor
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
that
question
was
asked
last
night.
no,
i
think
then
we
got
into
the
area
of
reasonableness,
your
honor
and
again
the
line
is
drawn
somewhere
and
it
is
reached
by
a
basis
that
is
non-arbitrary
and
i
assume
this
is
done
in
the
legislative
halls
and
in
the
testimony
of
witnesses
were
experts
in
education
before
various
committees.

would
not
be
a
particularly
advisable
area
whether
in
terms
of
education
today
this
is
reasonable.
it
would
probably
have
to
be
determined
by
the
court.
it
would
not
seem
to
be
the
case.
but
i
do
not
think
the
principle,
the
underlying
principle
is
much
different.
in
other
words,
it
is
a
matter
of
legislative
administrative
concern.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
we
have
absolutely
no
quarrel
to
the
amish
way
of
life.
in
fact
in
some
others,
in
the
remorseless
daily
crunch
of
living,
the
grass
on
the
amish
side
of
the
fence
looks
green
and
much
greener
than
ours
at
times.
but
i
submit
that
retreat
to
a
similar
era
may
have
had
some
justification
200
years
ago
when
russo
was
exalting
the
virtues
of
the
pro-american
man,
but
that
too
much
water
has
gone
through
the
turbines
for
that
kind
of
a
position.
what
is
needed
is
more
education
to
cope
with
the
problems
of
society,
more
pride
in
intellect
not
less
pride.
this
is
what
we
should
be
developing
in
our
educational
programs.
the
objection
that
the
amish
had
is
to
have
additional
two
years
at
this
point,
additional
two
years
of
education
and
the
people
before
the
court
here
are
on
it.
but
if
this
court
does
mature
in
this
decision,
it
will
apply
to
any
number
of
years
of
education.
there
can
be
no
effort
or
no
decision
of
this
court
it
seems
to
me
that
can
say
eighth
grade
is
the
cutoff
point.
there
is
nothing
logical
or
constitutional
about
the
cutoff.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
yes,
but
it
is
--
it
is
--
yes,
seven
or
eight
and
now
sixth
grade
is
considered
in
some
areas
as
elementary
education.
seventh,
eighth
and
ninth
are
considered
a
middle
school
and
then
the
balance
high
school.
in
some
areas,
there
is
a
junior
high
school.
now,
this
is
not
so
important
as
what
is
being
taught
as
changing.
the
worldly
courses
of
languages
and
foreign
languages
and
the
institution
of
educational
television
into
the
elementary
grades,
these
things
are
objectionable
to
see
and
the
dynamic
quality
of
education
makes
it
very
difficult
to
say
and
to
administer
a
rule
which
says
the
eighth
grade
is
the
limit
beyond
which
anyone
can
be
compelled
to
go
to
school.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
may
i
suggest
that
that
is
true.
that
education
today
is
undergoing
serious
study
and
revision
that
many
experts
in
the
field
have
written,
urging
reform
and
i
think
that
this
is
necessary.
i
think
that
there
should
be
organic
involvement
at
the
local
level
in
education
that
we
must
do
this,
but
i
think
what
this
court
should
be
doing
is
to
encourage
that
sort
of
thing,
encourage
the
affirmance
and
the
change
that
is
necessary
to
make
education
a
viable
institution.
that
is
what
this
court
is
to
do.
thank
you.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
i
do
not
agree
with
it
fundamentally.
no.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
that
--
yes,
the
trial
court
found
--
if
you
just
bear
with
me,
i
will
find
that
point.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
pardon
me.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
no,
it
is
not
--
what
it
says
is
that
they
did
not
exactly
reject
it,
but
it
just
did
not
consider
and
it
is
this,
on
page
181
of
the
appendix.
obviously,
in
the
long
history
of
the
sect,
it
is
existed
in
areas
when
and
where
there
was
no
such
thing
as
an
eighth
grade
or
an
even
school
systems
of
any
kind.
just
how
the
eighth
grade
cutoff
point
was
arrived
at
was
not
explained.
eight
was
apparently
not
the
test
nor
does
the
quality
of
the
school
system
apparently
a
factor.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
that
is
right.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
there
is
--
there
was
no
expert
testimony
that
contradicted
the
amish
testimony
except
the
testimony
of
the
state
superintendent
of
the
schools
in
the
county.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
yes.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
he
had.
he
knew
about
amish
people.
he
was
acquainted
with
amish
people,
they
live
down
there.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
no,
i
deny
that
--
i
say
this,
that
the
trial
court
found
that
this
did
not
interfere
with
the
religious
belief
as
such
but
with
their
freedom
to
act
and
that
the
freedom
to
act,
the
restriction
of
the
freedom
to
act
here
was
a
reasonable
one
which
has
been
imposed
since
1642
in
this
country,
that
the
compulsory
school-attendance
is
not
a
law
which
has
just
recently
been
enforced.
we
have
had
it
since
the
beginning
of
our
educational
system.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
respondents,
here
are
members
of
the
old
order
amish
religious
sect.
they
reside
in
green
county
of
southwestern
wisconsin.
in
november
of
1968,
when
they
refused
to
send
their
children
beyond
the
eighth
grade,
a
summon
and
criminal
complaint
was
filed
in
the
county
court
of
green
county.
they
were
tried
on
april
2,
1969
for
violation
of
the
wisconsin
compulsory
school-attendance
law.
the
case
was
tried
to
the
county
court
of
green
county
and
the
respondents
were
found
guilty
there.
they
had
a
trial
de
novo
in
the
circuit
court
of
green
county
where
the
court
again
found
them
guilty
and
imposed
a
minimum
fine
of
$5.00
on
each
of
the
respondents.
they
appealed
to
the
wisconsin
supreme
court.
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
reversed
and
this
court
granted
certiorari
on
may
24th
of
this
year.
respondents
object
to
education
of
the
children
in
public,
private,
secular
or
non-secular
schools
beyond
a
certain
point.
at
present
time,
the
objection
is
eighth
grade.
the
trial
court
noted
the
problem
with
the
arbitrary
eighth
grade
cutoff
in
its
decision.
now,
worried
about
the
decisions
and
opinions
that
were
filed
in
this
case
in
the
courts
below,
the
trial
court
below
found
that
the
compulsory
school
attendance
law
did
interfere
with
the
freedom
of
the
respondents
to
act
in
support
of
their
religious
beliefs.
they
also
found
that
appreciable
numbers
of
the
amish-reared
youth
do
believe
the
faith.
both
the
trial
courts
concluded
after
several
careful
consideration
of
the
cases
that
the
compulsory
school-attendance
laws
in
wisconsin
were
a
reasonable
exercise
of
the
police
power
of
the
state
to
educate
its
youth.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
yes,
that
is
through
a
certain
age.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
yes,
7
through
16.
this
is
pretty
general
throughout
the
rest
of
the
state.
it
is
based
on
age
but
not
on
grade.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
if
he
could
show
achievement
equivalent
to
a
high
school
education
at
any
point,
he
would
be
excused
from
the
compulsory
school
attendance
law.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
yes,
there
is
an
area
of
discretion
there
to
be
exercised
by
the
state
superintendent
of
the
public
instruction,
your
honor
and
this
provides
for
a
certain
unusual
cases
and
of
course
there
are
exemptions
for
a
health
problems
and
handicaps
and
that
sort
of
thing,
but
there
is
no
problem
with
respect
to
the
substantial
equivalency
of
the
education,
the
discretion
resting
with
the
state
superintendent
of
the
public
instruction.
now,
the
opinions
of
the
wisconsin
court
were
three
in
number.
there
is
principal
opinion
which
is
stated
on
page
133
of
the
appendix,
we
view
this
case
as
involving
solely
a
parents’
right
of
religious
freedom
to
bring
up
his
children
as
he
believe
god
dictates.
if
nothing
else,
that
god
dictates
in
an
infinite
variety
of
ways,
this
makes
for
a
thoroughly
broad
issue.
the
concurring
opinion
has
stated
this.
under
the
facts
of
this
case
there
has
been
an
inadequate
showing
that
the
state's
interest
in
establishing
and
maintaining
an
educational
system
overrides
the
defendants’
right
to
the
pre-exercise
of
his
religion.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
we
have
a
vocational
school
situation
in
the
law,
your
honor
which
--
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
yes.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
yes,
that
is
a
rather
elaborate
system
of
vocational
schools
in
wisconsin
and
there
is
a
provision
specifically
for
children
to
attend
the
vocational
school
if
that
vocational
school
is
within
the
school
district
and
the
trial
court
asked
the
same
question
in
this
area
and
was
satisfied
that
the
vocational
school
law
probably
had
no
particular
applications
in
this
case,
although
vocational
school
is
certainly
open
and
available
to
all
people
in
wisconsin.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
the
range
is
very
broad.
now,
the
agricultural
vocational
schools
which
would
probably
interest
the
amish
more
is
handled
through
the
land
grant,
the
old
federal
aid
program
to
agricultural
education
and
that
is
handled
in
the
high
school.
there
is
a
special
agricultural
teacher
who
is
paid
out
of
federal
funds
and
that
has
been
in
existence
for
a
long
time.
so
that
is
available.
there
is
not
any
question
that
these
vocational
programs
are
available
to
respondent.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
do
they
have
private
schools?
yes,
in
many
areas
they
do.
and
in
this
particular
instance
however
they
apparently
refused
to
set
up
any
school
which
goes
beyond
the
eighth
grade.
there
are
no
secondary
schools
in
operation
by
the
amish
in
wisconsin
that
i
know
of.
there
may
be
some
who
have
not
been
approved
by
the
state
superintendent,
but
are
still
in
operation.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
i
think
there
was
not
mr.
justice
blackmun.
there
was
absolutely
no
evidence
of
that
and
in
fact
this
has
been
a
rather
intelligently
and
studiously
tried
case
from
the
beginning.
there
is
a
good
–-
there
are
statements
in
the
record
of
expert
witnesses
speaking
in
favor
of
the
amish.
there
has
been
no
ranker
and
it
has
been
a
most
interesting
case
because
it
has
been
free
of
that
type
of
thing.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
well,
yes,
there
is
a
loss
of
state
aid,
but
that
is
really
insignificant
to
the
issues
involved.
i
do
not
think
that
has
really
anything
to
do
about
that.
the
state
aids
are
very
small
compared
to
the
real
need
of
the
school
district.
now
--
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
yes.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
yes,
it
is
not
a
question
of
children
here.
the
question
of
whether
the
parents
can
be
compelled
to
send
their
children
to
school?
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
we
think
there
are
two
issues
here
really.
first
of
all,
it
is
rather
the
–-
let
me
state
it,
whether
or
not
the
respondents
may
select
the
time,
the
extent
and
whether
or
not
they
will
comply
with
the
compulsory
school-attendance
laws
and
whether
there
is
somewhat
more
broadly
stated
a
constitutional
right
to
conscientiously
object
to
education.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
well,
first
we
are
concerned
about
the
rights
of
the
child
to
an
education.
i
think
we
are
concerned
about
that.
i
do
not
think
we
can
avoid
that
as
an
overriding
issue
and
i
think
the
dissenting
opinion
expressed
that
well,
because
the
compelling
interest
of
the
state
is
in
the
education
of
the
children
and
the
interest
of
the
child
in
education
is
important.
it
is
vital
and
this
is
what
we
think
the
real
issues
are.
now
--
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
is
to
--
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
that
is
right.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
that
is
right,
yes.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
yes.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
well,
that
is
right.
it
is
question
of
whether
or
not
it
complied
with
the
law.
in
this
--
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
yes,
we
think
there
is
a
compelling
interest
in
education.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
no,
i
do
not
think
there
has
to
be
any
other
kind
of
compelling
interest
because
it
is
through
compulsory
education,
compulsory
school
attendance
that
the
interest
is
implemented.
the
interest,
the
subject
we
regulate
is
education.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
yes.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
i
do
not
think
it
answers
the
question
completely.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
no,
i
do
not
think
the
compelling
interest
is
not
in
total
compliance
necessarily.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
court
can
say
that
the
amish
parents
have
a
constitutional
right
to
conscientiously
object
to
education,
to
sending
their
children
to
school.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
what
we
have
said
in
that
is
simply
this;
that
as
the
trial
court
said,
it
interferes
with
their
freedom
to
act
but
not
with
their
religious
belief
as
such
and
that
the
cases
are
clear
and
this
court
has
pronounced
time
and
again
that
the
freedom
to
act
may
be
restricted
in
interpretation
of
the
first
amendment,
but
the
freedom
to
believe
may
not.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
that
is
right.
the
old
morgan
cases,
cantwell
versus
connecticut.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
yes.
yes,
it
is
a
simple
as
that,
it
can
be
decided
that
way.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
what
we
are
saying
here
is
essentially
that
there
is
a
compelling
interest
in
education.
that
is
essentially
our
view,
and
that
this
court
and
the
congress,
people
of
this
country
have
manifested
this
compelling
interest.
the
concurring
opinion
--
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
that
is
right.
i
do
not
either
and
that
is
what
we
find
wrong,
and
this
is
why
we
are
here
because
this
is
what
they
said.
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
there
has
been
an
inadequate
showing
that
the
state’s
interest
in
establishing
and
maintaining
an
educational
system
overrides
defendants’
right
to
the
free
exercise
of
religion.
it
is
just
as
clear
as
that.
it
is
as
clear
as
the
conscientious
subject
of
their
cases.
it
is
as
clear
as
the
statement
in
gillette.
it
is
as
clear
as
ballard
and
seeger.
i
do
not
want
to
equate.
i
do
not
want
to
equate
military
rule
and/or
imply
by
equating
compulsory
education
with
military
conscription
that
the
heavy
hand
of
the
state
is
being
applied
here.
it
is
quite
the
contrary.
the
compulsory
school-attendance
laws
have
been
in
existence
for
years.
they
were
part
of
the
established
church
when
this
country
was
founded
the,
when
the
colonists
established
the
bureaucratic
societies
in
the
pre-revolutionary
days
when
the
church
became
--
this
established
a
compulsory
school-attendance
laws
remained.
they
remained
in
a
democratic
fashion
and
they
are
applied
and
enacted
in
a
democratic
fashion.
when
you
talk
about
sherbert
against
verner
which
is
the
case
in
which
the
respondents
rely,
you
have
an
entirely
different
set
of
values.
you
are
not
talking
in
sherbert
against
verner
about
a
social
institution
of
the
type
of
education,
military
conscription,
and
the
system
of
taxation,
all
of
these
other
things
where
the
legislature
acts
to
grant
the
exemption.
this
is
a
positive
force
that
we
are
dealing
with
for
the
benefit
of
society
and
it
is
the
legislature
that
to
determine
in
its
own
area
of
protection
of
the
liberties
of
this
country.
it
is
the
legislature
that
should
determine
whether
the
compulsory
school-attendance
laws
are
necessary
to
enact
or
to
obtain
the
full
benefit
of
education
to
the
individual
and
society.
at
this
point,
i
think
we
get
through
an
important
area
for
this
court
to
consider.
i
am
sure
that
you
are
aware
of
justice
frankfurter's
opinion
in
minersville
v.
gobitis
and
in
his
dissent
in
west
virginia
against
barnett.
in
these
particular
cases,
he
espoused
the
importance
of
a
legislature
and
it
is
in
this
particular
area,
in
the
area
of
education
where
we
are
talking
in
terms
of
positive
movement
of
more
education
and
not
less
--
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
--
that
the
legislature
has
an
important
function.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
well
--
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
well,
what
cases
in
particular
do
you
have
in
mind?
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
yes,
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
no,
i
think
that
what
--
yes,
i
think
what
the
court
is
–-
i
think
what
we
are
doing
is
opening
up
a
different
approach
to
the
same
argument.
we
will
arrive
at
the
same
conclusion.
as
i
think
justice
white
said,
it
is
our
good
fortune
in
lemon
v.
kurtzman
that
the
states
have
undertaken
to
educate
our
youth
and
to
compel
their
attendance
in
school
by
compulsory
school
attendance.
now,
what
we
are
concerned
about
here
takes
us
to
pierce
against
the
society
of
sisters
of
the
holy
name
where
the
court
said,
that
we
could
not
compel
attendance
at
public
schools,
but
there
was
no
reason
why
attendance
could
not
be
compelled
at
public
or
private,
secular
or
non-secular
schools
and
this
is
not
the
area
when
you
talk
about
age
of
parochial
education
that
we
get
into
it.
we
get
into
a
proposition
that
embraces
to
augment
this
and
that
is
not
really
the
question
here.
the
question
here
is
education
or
no
education?
it
is
not
the
question
of
private
education
or
public
education
or
how
much
one
should
be
aided
over
the
other.
yes,
there
is
a
first
amendment
question,
but
it
is
an
establishment
question
rather
than
a
freedom
to
worship
question.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
yes.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
that
is
right.
we
would
not.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
yes,
they
will
not.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
is
correct,
yes.
they
have
no
schools.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
well,
i
am
not
sure
because
i
am
not
sure
whether
that
would
meet
the
standard.
we
probably
would
not
be
here.
we
might
be
in
some
other
lower
court
determining
whether
there
was
a
reasonable
ruling
by
the
administrative
bodies
that
is
the
department
of
public
instruction
who
are
experts
in
this
area.
but
it
would
not
be
the
same
constitutional
question
that
is
involved
here.
that
i
think
is
safe
to
say
that
we
would
not
be
here.
now
--
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
do
the
amish?
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
yes,
i
think
there
are
some
grade
schools
and
i
believe
they
were
establishing
a
grade
school
in
the
green
county
area.
i
am
not
sure
of
that
but
i
know
there
are
some
schools
that
established
up
in
the
medford
area
in
the
northern
part
of
the
state.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
i
believe
that
those
schools
do
satisfy
state
standards,
although
it
may
be
that
the
superintendent
has
not
made
a
ruling
on
that.
now,
i
have
indicated
that
the
compulsory
school-attendance
law
and
the
ruling
of
the
wisconsin
courts
are
more
properly
analyzed
in
terms
of
the
a
conscientious
objector
cases,
walz,
seeger,
and
gillette.
and
to
this
extent,
the
ruling
of
the
wisconsin
court
does
present
a
constitutional
right
to
anyone
who
has
conscientious
objection
based
on
a
sincere
moral
belief
to
object
to
education.
and
we
submit
that
this
would
raise
have
it
with
the
educational
system
not
only
in
wisconsin,
but
throughout
the
country.
now,
let
us
look
at
the
specific
laws
for
example.
there
is
a
correlation
expressed
in
prince
against
massachusetts,
a
correlation
for
example
between
compulsory
education
and
compulsory
school
attendance
and
the
child
labor
laws.
they
are
integrated.
we
quoted
that
the
child
labor
laws
to
show
them
in
our
brief.
now,
not
only
is
there
a
correlation
there,
but
there
must
be
a
correlation
in
the
whole
program,
the
whole
legislative
program
regarding
children.
the
matter
in
which
a
juvenile
judge
for
example
deals
with
a
dependent
child
would
be
affected
by
the
decision
of
this
court
and
if
it
were
to
say
that
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
conscientiously
object
education,
i
feel
that
it
would
be
removing
a
vital
tool
from
the
administration
of
a
law
as
it
relates
to
youth
and
children.
i
will
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
your
honor
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
that
question
was
asked
last
night.
no,
i
think
then
we
got
into
the
area
of
reasonableness,
your
honor
and
again
the
line
is
drawn
somewhere
and
it
is
reached
by
a
basis
that
is
non-arbitrary
and
i
assume
this
is
done
in
the
legislative
halls
and
in
the
testimony
of
witnesses
were
experts
in
education
before
various
committees.
age
21
would
not
be
a
particularly
advisable
area
whether
in
terms
of
education
today
this
is
reasonable.
it
would
probably
have
to
be
determined
by
the
court.
it
would
not
seem
to
be
the
case.
but
i
do
not
think
the
principle,
the
underlying
principle
is
much
different.
in
other
words,
it
is
a
matter
of
legislative
administrative
concern.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
we
have
absolutely
no
quarrel
to
the
amish
way
of
life.
in
fact
in
some
others,
in
the
remorseless
daily
crunch
of
living,
the
grass
on
the
amish
side
of
the
fence
looks
green
and
much
greener
than
ours
at
times.
but
i
submit
that
retreat
to
a
similar
era
may
have
had
some
justification
200
years
ago
when
russo
was
exalting
the
virtues
of
the
pro-american
man,
but
that
too
much
water
has
gone
through
the
turbines
for
that
kind
of
a
position.
what
is
needed
is
more
education
to
cope
with
the
problems
of
society,
more
pride
in
intellect
not
less
pride.
this
is
what
we
should
be
developing
in
our
educational
programs.
the
objection
that
the
amish
had
is
to
have
additional
two
years
at
this
point,
additional
two
years
of
education
and
the
people
before
the
court
here
are
on
it.
but
if
this
court
does
mature
in
this
decision,
it
will
apply
to
any
number
of
years
of
education.
there
can
be
no
effort
or
no
decision
of
this
court
it
seems
to
me
that
can
say
eighth
grade
is
the
cutoff
point.
there
is
nothing
logical
or
constitutional
about
the
cutoff.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
yes,
but
it
is
--
it
is
--
yes,
seven
or
eight
and
now
sixth
grade
is
considered
in
some
areas
as
elementary
education.
seventh,
eighth
and
ninth
are
considered
a
middle
school
and
then
the
balance
high
school.
in
some
areas,
there
is
a
junior
high
school.
now,
this
is
not
so
important
as
what
is
being
taught
as
changing.
the
worldly
courses
of
languages
and
foreign
languages
and
the
institution
of
educational
television
into
the
elementary
grades,
these
things
are
objectionable
to
see
and
the
dynamic
quality
of
education
makes
it
very
difficult
to
say
and
to
administer
a
rule
which
says
the
eighth
grade
is
the
limit
beyond
which
anyone
can
be
compelled
to
go
to
school.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
may
i
suggest
that
that
is
true.
that
education
today
is
undergoing
serious
study
and
revision
that
many
experts
in
the
field
have
written,
urging
reform
and
i
think
that
this
is
necessary.
i
think
that
there
should
be
organic
involvement
at
the
local
level
in
education
that
we
must
do
this,
but
i
think
what
this
court
should
be
doing
is
to
encourage
that
sort
of
thing,
encourage
the
affirmance
and
the
change
that
is
necessary
to
make
education
a
viable
institution.
that
is
what
this
court
is
to
do.
thank
you.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
i
do
not
agree
with
it
fundamentally.
no.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
that
--
yes,
the
trial
court
found
--
if
you
just
bear
with
me,
i
will
find
that
point.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
pardon
me.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
no,
it
is
not
--
what
it
says
is
that
they
did
not
exactly
reject
it,
but
it
just
did
not
consider
and
it
is
this,
on
page
181
of
the
appendix.
obviously,
in
the
long
history
of
the
sect,
it
is
existed
in
areas
when
and
where
there
was
no
such
thing
as
an
eighth
grade
or
an
even
school
systems
of
any
kind.
just
how
the
eighth
grade
cutoff
point
was
arrived
at
was
not
explained.
eight
was
apparently
not
the
test
nor
does
the
quality
of
the
school
system
apparently
a
factor.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
that
is
right.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
there
is
--
there
was
no
expert
testimony
that
contradicted
the
amish
testimony
except
the
testimony
of
the
state
superintendent
of
the
schools
in
the
county.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
yes.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
he
had.
he
knew
about
amish
people.
he
was
acquainted
with
amish
people,
they
live
down
there.
mr.
john
w.
calhoun
no,
i
deny
that
--
i
say
this,
that
the
trial
court
found
that
this
did
not
interfere
with
the
religious
belief
as
such
but
with
their
freedom
to
act
and
that
the
freedom
to
act,
the
restriction
of
the
freedom
to
act
here
was
a
reasonable
one
which
has
been
imposed
since
1642
in
this
country,
that
the
compulsory
school-attendance
is
not
a
law
which
has
just
recently
been
enforced.
we
have
had
it
since
the
beginning
of
our
educational
system.
