mr.
william
b.
ball
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
wisconsin
attorney
general’s
attempt
to
have
these
amish
parents
found
criminally
guilty
has
now
entered
into
the
fourth
year.
this
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
in
january
of
this
year,
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
by
a
six
to
one
vote
tendered
two
conclusions
and
i
am
quoting
out
from
the
concurring
opinion,
“that
there
has
been
an
inadequate
showing
that
the
state’s
interest
in
establishing
and
maintaining
an
educational
system
overrides
defendant’s
right
to
free
exercise
of
religion”
and
secondly,
“that
amish
should
not
be
required
to
attend
the
school
which
meets
the
requirements
of
state
law
beyond
the
eighth
grade.”
and
even
the
one
dissenting
opinion
that
of
mr.
justice
heffernan
talks
about
how
this
prosecution
came
to
be
triggered.
so
there
is
strong
evidence
that
the
purpose
of
this
prosecution
was
not
to
further
the
compelling
interest
of
the
state
in
education,
rather
a
reprehensible
objective
under
the
facts
of
this
case
to
force
the
amish
into
school
only
for
the
purpose
of
qualifying
for
augmented
state
age.
i
am
going
to
tax
the
court
by
going
over
just
a
little
bit
some
of
the
facts
as
they
have
been
presented
because
i
think
they
are
basic,
from
hearing
the
questions
that
have
been
asked.
the
legal
basis
for
this
prosecution
is
the
refusal
of
these
parents
on
religious
grounds
to
afford
the
three
children
in
question
at
most
two
years
of
high
school
under
a
statute
which
requires
not
a
high
school
course,
not
four
years
of
high
school,
not
even
one
year
necessarily
but
merely
school
through
age
15
not
through
age
16,
through
age
15
according
to
the
statute.
now,
the
state
interest
becomes
a
little
bit
varied
when
we
think
in
terms
of
compelling
state
interest
because
if
there
is
a
vos
or
the
technical
school,
vocational
school
in
the
school
district
then
the
age
limit
is
18,
up
to
18
the
child
is
to
attend.
a
different
standard
applies
where
there
is
no
vo
school
and
the
record
in
this
case
establishes
that
there
was
no
vocational
school
in
this
district.
now,
then
in
terms
of
the
interest
the
state
has
been
trying
to
compel
these
children
to
attend
school
beyond
the
eighth
grade,
we
have
to
realize
that
for
frieda
yoder,
the
daughter
of
jonas
yoder,
one
of
the
three
children
in
question,
only
one
year
of
schooling
was
involved
because
she
was
15
years
and
five
months
old
on
the
day
the
criminal
complaint
was
brought
against
her
father.
barbara
miller
would
have
only
six
months
of
the
state
benefit
of
additional
compulsory
education
because
she
was
15
years
and
eight
months
old
at
the
time
the
criminal
complaint
was
brought.
now,
it
is
the
position
of
the
amish
parents
that
the
application
of
the
statute
to
them
violates
their
free
exercise
of
religion
and
that
there
has
been
no
showing
whatever,
no
showing
at
all
that
non-application
of
the
statute
to
them
violates
or
creates
any
substantial
danger
to
any
interest
of
the
state
of
wisconsin.
nobody
on
our
side
challenges
the
fact
that
the
compulsory
attendance
laws
as
we
speak
a
compelling
state
interest.
we
have
merely,
in
fact
emphasized
in
this
case
and
in
our
defense,
it
is
our
whole
sole
support
of
the
statement
of
this
court
in
brown
versus
the
board
of
education
wherein
the
court
said
education
is
a
principle
instrument
in
awakening
the
child's
cultural
values
and
preparing
them
for
later
professional
training
and
in
helping
him
to
adjust
normally
to
his
environment.
this
is
a
superb
description
of
what
the
amish
people
believe
in
terms
of
education.
my
argument,
may
it
please
the
court,
will
pursue
two
points.
one
the
pre-exercise
claim
and
secondly
the
question
of
danger
to
interest
of
the
state
which
the
state
of
wisconsin
has
said
existence
of
substantially
degree.
the
free
exercise
point
is
extremely
important
that
is
it
is
extremely
important,
but
i
will
try
to
develop
this
at
some
length
because
here
we
are
not
talking
about
one
tenet
of
the
religion
being
at
stake,
for
example
observance
of
the
sabbath
or
opposition
to
military
training.
we
are
not
talking
here
about
one
particular
practice,
say
spreading
the
gospel
through
speech
or
press
or
simply
as
a
period
of
a
number
of
cases.
we
are
not
talking
about
one
forced
exercise
such
as
the
salute
to
a
greater
image
or
recitation
of
papers
or
bible
reading.
we
are
talking
about
a
whole
complex
of
religious
interests,
religious
interests
and
rights
in
education
and
worship
and
parental
nurture,
an
individual
religious
choice
in
vocation,
in
communal
association
with
respect
to
teaching
and
learning
with
respect
to
privacy
as
we
have
tried
to
spell
out
in
our
brief
and
indeed
we
are
talking
about
as
will
appear
the
continued
existence
of
the
amish
faith
community
in
the
united
states.
in
graver
versus
kansas,
kansas
versus
graver
rather,
the
only
other
state
supreme
court
decision
in
point
various
kansas'
attention
was
paid
to
the
actualities
of
the
amish
religious
claim,
and
therefore,
we
are
dwelling
on
that
to
some
extent
here
this
morning.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes,
about
15
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
william
b.
ball
about
50,000
people.
mr.
william
b.
ball
there
are
slight
variations
among
them.
i
would
say
the
old
order
amish
are
fairly
uniform
whether
you
find
them
in
lancaster
county,
pennsylvania
or
you
find
them
them
in
madison,
wisconsin.
they
are
very
much
the
same.
they
follow
the
same
practices
and
have
the
same
attitudes
toward
religion,
education,
children,
the
simple
life
and
so
on.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes
sir.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes
sir.
mr.
william
b.
ball
old
order
amish
and
order
mennonite
and
some
variants
of
these
same
groups
which
are
nevertheless
basically
the
same.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
b.
ball
they
do.
they
go
back
to
a
time
in
the
sixteenth
century
mr.
justice
stewart
when
a
number
of
people
of
the
protestant
reformation
sought
to
return
to
what
they
believe
to
be
the
golden
age
of
christianity.
in
the
early
centuries
of
christianity
and
reject
the
institutional
churches
of
the
catholic
church
and
the
other
protestant
churches
and
to
do
this,
and
to
have
that
life,
they
believe
that
their
lives
had
to
be
governed
completely
by
the
sermon
on
the
mount
and
this
would
be
therefore
the
cult
of
the
creating
of
a
community
of
love,
of
mutual
health,
of
simplicity,
closeness
to
nature,
animals,
soil,
plants
and
so
on
turning
the
other
cheek,
and
extremely
importantly,
perhaps
the
most
critical
point
in
the
understanding
of
the
amish
religion,
separation
from
the
world
is
they
believe
was
not
only
the
practical
means
whereby
this
light
could
be
lit,
but
was
also
a
means,
a
principle
enjoined
upon
them
by
the
gospels
themselves
for
st.
paul’s
speaks
and
says,
do
not
be
conformed
to
this
world.
this
is
a
basic
doctrine
of
amish
religious
teaching
and
so
therefore
they
in
two
ways
have
sought
to
separate
themselves
in
the
world
and
have
maintained
this
over
the
centuries.
first
of
all,
they
see
that
there
has
to
be
a
separation
from
what
they
consider,
pride
of
intellect,
that
is
to
say
the
higher
learning
as
they
express
it.
they
believe
that
education’s
aim
should
be
the
life
of
goodness,
not
the
life
of
the
intellect,
the
making
of
a
good
man,
not
the
making
of
a
good
american
life.
they
believe
that
this
life
of
goodness
rejects
the
world
of
technical
cunning
and
instead
embraces
wisdom.
they
believe
that
life
is
a
very
short
pilgrimage
and
its
whole
purpose
is
to
get
human
beings
to
their
salvation
in
the
arms
of
god.
a
question
was
posed,
a
very
enlightening
question
was
posed
upon
the
trial
by
the
deputy
attorney
general
assigned
to
the
department
of
education
in
wisconsin.
he
said
to
professor
john
hostetler
who
was
an
expert
witness
on
the
side
of
the
defense
and
who
is
the
world’s
foremost
authority
on
the
amish
people,
he
asked
dr.
hostetler,
is
it
not
that
the
point
of
education
to
help
a
person
to
get
ahead
in
the
world?
and
dr.
hostetler
superbly
replied,
it
depends
on
which
world,
later
explaining
that
of
course
what
he
meant
was
that
the
aim
of
education
as
far
as
the
amish
are
concerned
is
to
get
to
heaven.
therefore
they
reject
what
many
or
the
rest
of
us
accept
in
a
world
of
knowledge
and
they
believe
that
the
education
in
writing
and
reading
an
arithmetic
which
a
child
can
acquire
up
until
the
time
of
adolescence
is
sufficient
education,
particularly
in
view
of
the
fact
that
amish
life
is
not
concerned
with
technical
and
technological
achievement
and
development.
mr.
william
b.
ball
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
b.
ball
it
shows
that
he
lets
the
amish
faith.
it
shows
that
people
can
live
the
amish
faith
and
that
the
fact
that
they
began
in
life
as
amish
children
is
necessarily
a
crippling
experience.
he
later
elected
to
leave
the
amish
faith
and
this
is
done
in
the
amish
faith
at
the
time
of
adult
baptism.
at
that
time,
a
child
or
a
young
man
or
woman
must
face
up
to
the
fact
that
whether
he
wishes
to
leave
the
amish
life
or
not.
he
may
refuse
to
leave
the
amish
life
if
he
wishes
to.
some
do.
there
are
no
wholesale
departures
from
the
ranks
of
the
amish
people.
i
think
that
we
brought
out
in
our
brief
and
in
dr.
hostetler
as
many
of
his
works
on
this
subject
is
shown
that
while
there
is
some
attrition,
the
community
has
continued
in
pretty
much
the
same
size
over
the
years.
well,
his
first
rejection
--
almost
rejection
of
the
world
of
intellect
and
the
second
--
mr.
william
b.
ball
well,
they
believe
that
those
basic
skills
are
sound
and
desirable
for
a
child
to
have.
they
are
quite
aware
of
their
citizenship.
hey
believe
that
a
person
should
be
able
to
read
and
write
and
communicate.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes,
there
is
an
affirmative
acceptance
of
education
on
that
point.
mr.
william
b.
ball
that
is
quite
true
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes,
that
is
quite
correct.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes,
they
rely
upon
medical
knowledge.
they
simply
–-
their
point
of
view
is
not
whether
medical
knowledge
is
necessarily
good
for
the
world.
their
point
of
view
is
simply
based
upon
the
fact
that
they
believe
that
they
themselves
may
not
pursue
the
higher
learning.
this
is
a
point
of
strict
relief
with
these
people.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes,
they
will
seek
medical
treatment.
right
now,
they
are
receiving
the
health,
so
they
did
not
seek
it.
it
came
to
them
through
the
national
committee
for
amish
religious
freedom,
but
they
do
not.
they
would
far
rather
suffer
personally,
prosecution
then
make
a
test
case
going
to
court
and
so
on.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
the
supplemental
appendix
sets
forth
the
ethics
which
we
made
under
a
number
of
provisions
of
wisconsin
law
in
which
we
felt
there
was
some
daylight
of
these
people.
we
attempted
a
negotiation
for
them
to
avoid
having
any
kind
of
court
case
and
these
attempts
were
rejected
out
of
hand
as
i
think
the
supplemental
appendix
very
clearly
reveals.
the
second
element
of
separation
is
the
separation
from
the
ways
of
the
world.
the
amish
do
not
want
their
children
and
they
do
not
want
themselves
to
be
exposed
to
the
spirit
of
luxury,
lust,
temptation,
of
strife,
consumerism,
competition,
speed,
violence,
and
other
such
elements,
as
are
commonly
found
in
our
american
way.
therefore
education
for
them
embraces
a
rejection
of
the
higher
learning
and
a
positive
emphasis
upon
learning
of
the
agriculture
life.
it
rejects
the
concept
of
exposure
to
and
service
in
the
ways
of
the
world
and
when
you
add
to
this,
the
factor
of
adolescence
you
will
see
why
an
amish
person
whether
we
would
agree
with
him
or
not
may
not
in
a
religious
point
of
view
attend
school
beyond
the
eighth
grade.
that
factor
of
adolescence
is
extremely
basic
in
amish
religious
thinking.
it
is
the
time
which
leads
to
adult
baptism.
it
is
the
time
of
the
starting
of
life
to
work,
meeting
the
challenges
of
real
responsibilities
on
the
part
of
young
people.
it
is
a
very
sensitive
time
when
values
are
formed.
the
amish
religion
forbids
high
school
then
because
of
those
three
elements,
a
tremendous
stress
on
the
importance
of
the
opportunity
which
adolescence
creates.
now
if
they
are
placed
in
school,
the
record
shows
that
they
are
going
to
be
--
these
children
are
going
to
be
exposed
to
the
social
life
in
the
school,
be
it
public,
private,
or
parochial.
they
are
going
to
be
exposed
to
a
curriculum
much
of
which
they
must
religiously
reject
and
much
of
which
is
the
purpose
to
their
intended
life
as
growing
up
in
the
amish
faith
community.
mr.
william
b.
ball
mr.
justice
brennan,
those
are
all
elementary
schools.
the
amish
do
not
maintain
any
high
school
whatever
--
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes,
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
brennan.
now,
when
you
take
a
child
from
amish
life
at
adolescence
and
place
him
in
a
high
school,
he
is
naturally
going
to
be
exposed
to
those
values
which
his
parents’
religion
rejects,
is
going
to
be
exposed
in
those
ways
of
life
which
typify
high
school
today
and
this
alienation
which
is
abundant
testimony
in
the
record,
this
alienation
of
the
child
who
has
been
raised
as
he
has
a
right
to
be
raised
in
the
amish
faith
community
up
until
adolescence.
there
is
no
disagreement
with
that
on
the
part
of
the
state.
he
has
been
raised
in
that
atmosphere
up
until
then
to
be
suddenly
placed
in
a
high
school
where
there
is
different
dress,
different
speech,
very,
very
different
people
with
very,
very
different
backgrounds.
this
is
extremely
traumatic
to
the
person
and
this
alienation
is
psychologically
damaging
to
such
a
person.
mr.
william
b.
ball
in
the
eighth
grade,
our
particular
defendants
were
in
parochial
schools,
amish
parochial
schools
until
the
eighth
grade.
they
attend
an
eighth
grade,
they
attend
up
to
that
time
whether
they
are
in
a
public
or
an
amish
school
to
be
at
least
in
part
associated
with
other
amish
children.
the
amish
placed
a
tremendous
importance
of
task
coming
to
adolescence.
they
believe
that
it
is
at
that
time
in
one's
life
when
you
are
heading
toward
adult
baptism
and
when
the
whole
person
is
in
the
state
of
permanent
change
that
at
that
time
in
your
life,
the
influences
of
the
world
can
be
especially
deadly
to
the
amish
child.
i
think
adolescence
is
a
very
important
part
of
this
whole
thinking
of
the
amish
that
up
until
the
eighth
grade
in
those
earlier
years,
the
chance
or
the
temptations
to
become
a
worldly
person
and
the
imposition
of
values
in
another
school
system
may
have
far
less
impact
than
they
will
to
a
child
who
is
beyond
or
in
adolescence.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes,
this
is
correct.
the
amish
parochial
schools
are
amish
schools
and
the
children
--
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes,
in
fact
it
was
understood
that
this
prosecution
was
triggered
by
the
very
fact
that
as
the
record
shows
an
amish
one
to
eighth
grade
school
had
been
started.
mr.
william
b.
ball
now
these
children
--
mr.
william
b.
ball
there
is
a
number
--
many
amish
children
have
attended
public
schools
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes.
mr.
william
b.
ball
the
pattern
varies.
in
some
cases
they
have
been
mixed
in
with
others
and
some
where
it
had
been
perhaps
a
majority
of
amish
children
in
school.
mr.
william
b.
ball
in
the
high
school
level
it
would
be
a
very
much
broader
mix
and
at
the
time
of
high
school
the
child
is
then
in
the
amish
religion
being
prepared
for
a
complete
vocation
in
amish
life.
and
this
is
extremely
disrupted
to
that
vocation
and
secondly,
it
is
a
time
in
life
when
exposures
to
these
elements
are
going
to
have
a
very
serious
impact
upon
his
values.
he
will
have
been
raised
and
even
in
the
eighth
grade
in
the
eighth
year
essentially
in
an
amish
community
and
the
involvement
in
high
school
with
its
social
life
and
everything
else
is
going
to
be
destructive
of
his
faith.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes.
mr.
william
b.
ball
i
think
it
is
quite
a
close
analogy
mr.
chief
justice
burger
and
i
think
that
is
well
brought
out
by
the
way
in
the
brief
of
the
--
brief
amicus
curiae
in
this
case
by
the
synagogue
council
of
america
and
other
related
jewish
groups.
the
–-
i
would
like
to
comment
if
i
may
with
the
time
that
remains
to
discuss
the
danger
would
strike
which
a
state
has
said
it
is
faced
with,
if
these
amish
children
for
religious
reasons
are
permitted
to
not
attend
school
through
age
15.
one
has
to
ask
whether
the
state
with
its
very
ample
legal
research
resources,
why
they
never
placed
a
single
witness
on
the
stand
produce
any
documentary
evidence
at
all
once
rapid
with
any
study
which
would
give
color
to
the
charge
that
amish
non-attendance
threatens
some
compelling
state
interest.
all
the
evidence
on
that
point
of
compelling
state
interest
came
to
the
defense.
state
offered
really
two
points.
first
of
all
that
amish
non-attendance,
two
years,
one
year,
six
months,
whatever
it
might
be
threatens
of
all
things
the
states
establishing
and
maintaining
an
educational
system.
six
judges
below
and
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
denied
this
fact.
certainly,
here
there
is
no
danger
of
fraud.
very
few
people
could
show
what
the
amish
have
shown
that
is
to
say
a
unique
and
ancient
religious
tradition
and
religious
claim
that
the
obvious
nurture
and
protection
of
children
which
takes
place
in
the
amish
community
which
treasures
children,
the
whole
factor
of
training
in
life
that
are
useful
and
productive
vocation
and
no
casting
of
the
children
upon
the
community,
certainly
here
there
is
far
less
danger
at
all
or
disturbance
of
a
system
that
was
found
in
sherbert
versus
verner.
no
one
else’s
rights
are
harmed
by
virtue
of
amish
none
attendance.
and
here
i
am
reminded
of
the
statement
of
mr.
justice
brennan
in
dissenting
in
braunfeld
when
he
said
that
values
of
the
first
amendment
looked
primarily
towards
preservation
of
personal
liberty
rather
than
toward
fulfillment
of
collective
goals.
here
we
have
precisely
that
put
in
the
scope.
the
collective
goal
is
not
going
to
be
disturbed
by
the
fact
that
these
children
did
not
attend
school.
additionally,
that
i
have
to
reinforce
what
mr.
calhoun
said
a
few
moments
ago
when
he
pointed
to
the
court
the
findings
of
the
trial
court,
the
finding
of
the
circuit
court
and
the
determination
by
the
state
supreme
court
that
could
be
exercised
of
the
amish
religion
was
patently
here
involved.
that
the
state’s
action
enforcing
these
children
into
high
school
constitutes
a
denial
of
the
free
exercise
of
religion.
this
i
think
is
established
in
the
case
irrespective
of
what
may
be
brought
at
the
amish
religion.
the
remaining
question
then
becomes
one
of
a
compelling
state
interest
which
means
what
is
the
danger
to
the
state
and
certainly
it
is
not
in
the
general
enforcement
or
maintenance
of
an
educational
system.
now,
does
it
deny
the
child
free
choice?
does
it
deny
the
child
as
the
state
says
his
right
to
an
education?
there
is
national
consensus
that
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
at
page
32
to
this
effect
that
there
is
no
compelling
state
interest
reflected
in
state
compulsory
attendance
laws
in
having
children
attend
school
beyond
the
15th
birthday
and
this
seems
to
be
if
this
is
the
case
in
state
after
state
after
state
that
the
state
does
not
feel
that
a
child
needs
to
attend
school
beyond
15
then
it
seems
to
me
that
these
children
in
question
do
not
present
in
terms
of
their
own
rights
to
an
education
any
danger
to
any
compelling
state
interest.
we
have
produced
an
evidence
and
cited
in
our
brief
this
study
which
was
by
professor
john
hostetler
under
a
commission
from
the
u.s.
office
of
education
of
achievements
of
amish
children
and
standardized
testing
and
it
reveals
that
they
perform
well.
the
state
has
referred
to
prince
versus
massachusetts
in
its
argument
on
behalf
of
parens
patriae
but
we
have
been
able
to
show
i
think
quite
clearly
that
there
is
no
such
danger
to
these
children
as
was
involved
in
the
prince
case
whose
facts
were
that
of
a
child
hawking
religious
magazines
at
night
in
streets.
amish
life
is
a
gardener
of
nurture
of
children.
certainly,
the
attorney
general
is
not
telling
us
that
the
child
labor
laws
in
wisconsin
are
not
enforced
and
certainly
therefore
if
there
is
any
need
for
protection
in
that
direction,
the
state
of
wisconsin
is
very
able
to
afford
that
protection.
the
state
has
thought
loosely
about
the
disease
of
ignorance
and
opening
the
gateways
of
opportunity
to
these
children.
we
introduced
positive
evidence
which
shows
that
amish
education
produces
good
people.
we
cited
the
testimony
of
dr.
erickson
of
the
university
of
chicago
and
we
specifically
asked
him
questions
concerning
amish
education
which
he
had
very
carefully
studied
and
his
comment
was
this.
the
amish
definitely
provide
for
their
children
of
high
school
age
what
could
be
called
an
education.
remember
this
was
uncontroverted
by
anything
the
state
chose
to
put
in
the
record.
i
would
be
inclined
to
say
that
they
do
a
better
job
at
this
than
most
of
the
rest
of
us
do.
the
amish
are
in
a
fortunate
position
respecting
schooling
which
they
conduct
for
children
beyond
the
eighth
grade.
it
is
learning
by
doing,
an
ideal
system.
we
are
learning
that
current
education
is
detached
from
the
real
world
and
that
in
the
things
they
talk
about,
pupils
do
not
become
involved
or
have
real
responsibility.
the
lack
in
modern
education
of
a
clear
connection
between
learning
and
doing
is
responsible
for
much
of
the
student
actions
that
we
have
today.
we
asked
what
kind
of
people
these
are
and
we
put
the
sheriff
of
green
county
on
the
stand,
we
asked
him
question
after
question
after
question
about
those
crimes
of
violence
which
most
typical
typically
committed
by
young
people
today;
arson,
looting,
rape,
etcetera,
etcetera,
etcetera.
the
sheriff
gave
these
people
a
complete
bill
of
health.
they
have
never
been
known
for
the
commission
of
crime.
dr.
littell
an
authority
in
the
history
of
the
amish
people
stated
that
they
have
not
been
known
who
have
committed
a
felony
in
250
years
on
this
soil.
they
are
a
peaceable
people
and
an
asset
in
our
society,
not
in
terms
of
gross
national
product
or
the
building
of
missiles,
but
certainly
in
terms
–-
but
certainly
in
terms
of
the
goodness
that
they
have
afford
as
an
example
for
the
rest
of
our
society.
we
placed
the
welfare
director
on
the
stand,
the
welfare
director
of
green
county,
and
we
asked
him
whether
the
amish
take
care
of
their
old
people,
their
dependent
people
and
the
director
of
welfare
testified
that
the
amish
completely
take
care
of
themselves.
they
do
not
cast
their
burden
on
the
community.
they
do
not
have
people
on
relief
or
welfare.
they
do
not
have
their
aged
and
public
funds
for
the
aged.
i
think
that
we
are
talking
about
here
are
really
great
achievers.
they
have
been
in
the
education
business
for
300
years.
they
are
the
finest
natural
farmers
in
the
western
hemisphere.
you
go
up
--
members
of
the
court
you
go
up
to
lancaster
county
in
pennsylvania
and
if
you
were
to
see
these
people,
see
them
in
actuality,
you
would
find
young
men
who
are
heads
of
family
and
managers
of
large
farms,
experts
in
husbandry,
you
would
find
in
their
women
very
model
women,
managers
of
households,
very
fine
people.
i
think
that
it
is
quite
surprising
that
these
people
are
singled
out
as
not
having
an
education,
denying
their
people
of
education.
for
300
years,
these
people
have
done
superbly.
for
300
years
these
people
have
performed
very
well
in
our
society.
the
question
before
the
court
then
is
whether
the
state
may
destroy
because
that
is
what
it
will
come
to
if
these
children
are
forced
into
high
school,
a
peaceable,
self
sustaining
community,
250
years
on
this
soil
on
the
ground,
if
parents
in
that
community
cannot
send
their
children
on
account
of
a
clear
mandate
of
their
religion
to
one
or
two
years
of
high
school.
mr.
justice
stewart,
in
braunfeld
said
that
the
orthodox
jews
in
that
case
were
faced
with
a
cruel
choice.
a
far
cruel
choice
is
presented
in
this
case.
if
the
decision
of
this
court
is
against
the
amish,
i
fear
that
many
people
will
feel
that
this
court
has
indicted
our
nation
as
two
(inaudible)
to
allow
difference,
innocent
difference
to
exist
and
to
flourish
in
its
midst.
the
amish
did
not
come
here
as
fearful
supplicants
to
this
court.
they
come
here
with
confidence,
believing
in
this
court
as
there
brothers
in
justice,
in
love
and
goodness,
and
belief
in
constitutional
liberty.
thank
you.
mr.
william
b.
ball
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
wisconsin
attorney
general’s
attempt
to
have
these
amish
parents
found
criminally
guilty
has
now
entered
into
the
fourth
year.
this
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
in
january
of
this
year,
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
by
a
six
to
one
vote
tendered
two
conclusions
and
i
am
quoting
out
from
the
concurring
opinion,
“that
there
has
been
an
inadequate
showing
that
the
state’s
interest
in
establishing
and
maintaining
an
educational
system
overrides
defendant’s
right
to
free
exercise
of
religion”
and
secondly,
“that
amish
should
not
be
required
to
attend
the
school
which
meets
the
requirements
of
state
law
beyond
the
eighth
grade.”
and
even
the
one
dissenting
opinion
that
of
mr.
justice
heffernan
talks
about
how
this
prosecution
came
to
be
triggered.
so
there
is
strong
evidence
that
the
purpose
of
this
prosecution
was
not
to
further
the
compelling
interest
of
the
state
in
education,
rather
a
reprehensible
objective
under
the
facts
of
this
case
to
force
the
amish
into
school
only
for
the
purpose
of
qualifying
for
augmented
state
age.
i
am
going
to
tax
the
court
by
going
over
just
a
little
bit
some
of
the
facts
as
they
have
been
presented
because
i
think
they
are
basic,
from
hearing
the
questions
that
have
been
asked.
the
legal
basis
for
this
prosecution
is
the
refusal
of
these
parents
on
religious
grounds
to
afford
the
three
children
in
question
at
most
two
years
of
high
school
under
a
statute
which
requires
not
a
high
school
course,
not
four
years
of
high
school,
not
even
one
year
necessarily
but
merely
school
through
age
15
not
through
age
16,
through
age
15
according
to
the
statute.
now,
the
state
interest
becomes
a
little
bit
varied
when
we
think
in
terms
of
compelling
state
interest
because
if
there
is
a
vos
or
the
technical
school,
vocational
school
in
the
school
district
then
the
age
limit
is
18,
up
to
18
the
child
is
to
attend.
a
different
standard
applies
where
there
is
no
vo
school
and
the
record
in
this
case
establishes
that
there
was
no
vocational
school
in
this
district.
now,
then
in
terms
of
the
interest
the
state
has
been
trying
to
compel
these
children
to
attend
school
beyond
the
eighth
grade,
we
have
to
realize
that
for
frieda
yoder,
the
daughter
of
jonas
yoder,
one
of
the
three
children
in
question,
only
one
year
of
schooling
was
involved
because
she
was
15
years
and
five
months
old
on
the
day
the
criminal
complaint
was
brought
against
her
father.
barbara
miller
would
have
only
six
months
of
the
state
benefit
of
additional
compulsory
education
because
she
was
15
years
and
eight
months
old
at
the
time
the
criminal
complaint
was
brought.
now,
it
is
the
position
of
the
amish
parents
that
the
application
of
the
statute
to
them
violates
their
free
exercise
of
religion
and
that
there
has
been
no
showing
whatever,
no
showing
at
all
that
non-application
of
the
statute
to
them
violates
or
creates
any
substantial
danger
to
any
interest
of
the
state
of
wisconsin.
nobody
on
our
side
challenges
the
fact
that
the
compulsory
attendance
laws
as
we
speak
a
compelling
state
interest.
we
have
merely,
in
fact
emphasized
in
this
case
and
in
our
defense,
it
is
our
whole
sole
support
of
the
statement
of
this
court
in
brown
versus
the
board
of
education
wherein
the
court
said
education
is
a
principle
instrument
in
awakening
the
child's
cultural
values
and
preparing
them
for
later
professional
training
and
in
helping
him
to
adjust
normally
to
his
environment.
this
is
a
superb
description
of
what
the
amish
people
believe
in
terms
of
education.
my
argument,
may
it
please
the
court,
will
pursue
two
points.
one
the
pre-exercise
claim
and
secondly
the
question
of
danger
to
interest
of
the
state
which
the
state
of
wisconsin
has
said
existence
of
substantially
degree.
the
free
exercise
point
is
extremely
important
that
is
it
is
extremely
important,
but
i
will
try
to
develop
this
at
some
length
because
here
we
are
not
talking
about
one
tenet
of
the
religion
being
at
stake,
for
example
observance
of
the
sabbath
or
opposition
to
military
training.
we
are
not
talking
here
about
one
particular
practice,
say
spreading
the
gospel
through
speech
or
press
or
simply
as
a
period
of
a
number
of
cases.
we
are
not
talking
about
one
forced
exercise
such
as
the
salute
to
a
greater
image
or
recitation
of
papers
or
bible
reading.
we
are
talking
about
a
whole
complex
of
religious
interests,
religious
interests
and
rights
in
education
and
worship
and
parental
nurture,
an
individual
religious
choice
in
vocation,
in
communal
association
with
respect
to
teaching
and
learning
with
respect
to
privacy
as
we
have
tried
to
spell
out
in
our
brief
and
indeed
we
are
talking
about
as
will
appear
the
continued
existence
of
the
amish
faith
community
in
the
united
states.
in
graver
versus
kansas,
kansas
versus
graver
rather,
the
only
other
state
supreme
court
decision
in
point
various
kansas'
attention
was
paid
to
the
actualities
of
the
amish
religious
claim,
and
therefore,
we
are
dwelling
on
that
to
some
extent
here
this
morning.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes,
about
15
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
william
b.
ball
about
50,000
people.
mr.
william
b.
ball
there
are
slight
variations
among
them.
i
would
say
the
old
order
amish
are
fairly
uniform
whether
you
find
them
in
lancaster
county,
pennsylvania
or
you
find
them
them
in
madison,
wisconsin.
they
are
very
much
the
same.
they
follow
the
same
practices
and
have
the
same
attitudes
toward
religion,
education,
children,
the
simple
life
and
so
on.

old
order
amish
and
order
mennonite
and
some
variants
of
these
same
groups
which
are
nevertheless
basically
the
same.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
b.
ball
they
do.
they
go
back
to
a
time
in
the
sixteenth
century
mr.
justice
stewart
when
a
number
of
people
of
the
protestant
reformation
sought
to
return
to
what
they
believe
to
be
the
golden
age
of
christianity.
in
the
early
centuries
of
christianity
and
reject
the
institutional
churches
of
the
catholic
church
and
the
other
protestant
churches
and
to
do
this,
and
to
have
that
life,
they
believe
that
their
lives
had
to
be
governed
completely
by
the
sermon
on
the
mount
and
this
would
be
therefore
the
cult
of
the
creating
of
a
community
of
love,
of
mutual
health,
of
simplicity,
closeness
to
nature,
animals,
soil,
plants
and
so
on
turning
the
other
cheek,
and
extremely
importantly,
perhaps
the
most
critical
point
in
the
understanding
of
the
amish
religion,
separation
from
the
world
is
they
believe
was
not
only
the
practical
means
whereby
this
light
could
be
lit,
but
was
also
a
means,
a
principle
enjoined
upon
them
by
the
gospels
themselves
for
st.
paul’s
speaks
and
says,
do
not
be
conformed
to
this
world.
this
is
a
basic
doctrine
of
amish
religious
teaching
and
so
therefore
they
in
two
ways
have
sought
to
separate
themselves
in
the
world
and
have
maintained
this
over
the
centuries.
first
of
all,
they
see
that
there
has
to
be
a
separation
from
what
they
consider,
pride
of
intellect,
that
is
to
say
the
higher
learning
as
they
express
it.
they
believe
that
education’s
aim
should
be
the
life
of
goodness,
not
the
life
of
the
intellect,
the
making
of
a
good
man,
not
the
making
of
a
good
american
life.
they
believe
that
this
life
of
goodness
rejects
the
world
of
technical
cunning
and
instead
embraces
wisdom.
they
believe
that
life
is
a
very
short
pilgrimage
and
its
whole
purpose
is
to
get
human
beings
to
their
salvation
in
the
arms
of
god.
a
question
was
posed,
a
very
enlightening
question
was
posed
upon
the
trial
by
the
deputy
attorney
general
assigned
to
the
department
of
education
in
wisconsin.
he
said
to
professor
john
hostetler
who
was
an
expert
witness
on
the
side
of
the
defense
and
who
is
the
world’s
foremost
authority
on
the
amish
people,
he
asked
dr.
hostetler,
is
it
not
that
the
point
of
education
to
help
a
person
to
get
ahead
in
the
world?
and
dr.
hostetler
superbly
replied,
it
depends
on
which
world,
later
explaining
that
of
course
what
he
meant
was
that
the
aim
of
education
as
far
as
the
amish
are
concerned
is
to
get
to
heaven.
therefore
they
reject
what
many
or
the
rest
of
us
accept
in
a
world
of
knowledge
and
they
believe
that
the
education
in
writing
and
reading
an
arithmetic
which
a
child
can
acquire
up
until
the
time
of
adolescence
is
sufficient
education,
particularly
in
view
of
the
fact
that
amish
life
is
not
concerned
with
technical
and
technological
achievement
and
development.
mr.
william
b.
ball
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
b.
ball
it
shows
that
he
lets
the
amish
faith.
it
shows
that
people
can
live
the
amish
faith
and
that
the
fact
that
they
began
in
life
as
amish
children
is
necessarily
a
crippling
experience.
he
later
elected
to
leave
the
amish
faith
and
this
is
done
in
the
amish
faith
at
the
time
of
adult
baptism.
at
that
time,
a
child
or
a
young
man
or
woman
must
face
up
to
the
fact
that
whether
he
wishes
to
leave
the
amish
life
or
not.
he
may
refuse
to
leave
the
amish
life
if
he
wishes
to.
some
do.
there
are
no
wholesale
departures
from
the
ranks
of
the
amish
people.
i
think
that
we
brought
out
in
our
brief
and
in
dr.
hostetler
as
many
of
his
works
on
this
subject
is
shown
that
while
there
is
some
attrition,
the
community
has
continued
in
pretty
much
the
same
size
over
the
years.
well,
his
first
rejection
--
almost
rejection
of
the
world
of
intellect
and
the
second
--
mr.
william
b.
ball
well,
they
believe
that
those
basic
skills
are
sound
and
desirable
for
a
child
to
have.
they
are
quite
aware
of
their
citizenship.
hey
believe
that
a
person
should
be
able
to
read
and
write
and
communicate.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes,
there
is
an
affirmative
acceptance
of
education
on
that
point.
mr.
william
b.
ball
that
is
quite
true
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes,
that
is
quite
correct.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes,
they
rely
upon
medical
knowledge.
they
simply
–-
their
point
of
view
is
not
whether
medical
knowledge
is
necessarily
good
for
the
world.
their
point
of
view
is
simply
based
upon
the
fact
that
they
believe
that
they
themselves
may
not
pursue
the
higher
learning.
this
is
a
point
of
strict
relief
with
these
people.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes,
they
will
seek
medical
treatment.
right
now,
they
are
receiving
the
health,
so
they
did
not
seek
it.
it
came
to
them
through
the
national
committee
for
amish
religious
freedom,
but
they
do
not.
they
would
far
rather
suffer
personally,
prosecution
then
make
a
test
case
going
to
court
and
so
on.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
the
supplemental
appendix
sets
forth
the
ethics
which
we
made
under
a
number
of
provisions
of
wisconsin
law
in
which
we
felt
there
was
some
daylight
of
these
people.
we
attempted
a
negotiation
for
them
to
avoid
having
any
kind
of
court
case
and
these
attempts
were
rejected
out
of
hand
as
i
think
the
supplemental
appendix
very
clearly
reveals.
the
second
element
of
separation
is
the
separation
from
the
ways
of
the
world.
the
amish
do
not
want
their
children
and
they
do
not
want
themselves
to
be
exposed
to
the
spirit
of
luxury,
lust,
temptation,
of
strife,
consumerism,
competition,
speed,
violence,
and
other
such
elements,
as
are
commonly
found
in
our
american
way.
therefore
education
for
them
embraces
a
rejection
of
the
higher
learning
and
a
positive
emphasis
upon
learning
of
the
agriculture
life.
it
rejects
the
concept
of
exposure
to
and
service
in
the
ways
of
the
world
and
when
you
add
to
this,
the
factor
of
adolescence
you
will
see
why
an
amish
person
whether
we
would
agree
with
him
or
not
may
not
in
a
religious
point
of
view
attend
school
beyond
the
eighth
grade.
that
factor
of
adolescence
is
extremely
basic
in
amish
religious
thinking.
it
is
the
time
which
leads
to
adult
baptism.
it
is
the
time
of
the
starting
of
life
to
work,
meeting
the
challenges
of
real
responsibilities
on
the
part
of
young
people.
it
is
a
very
sensitive
time
when
values
are
formed.
the
amish
religion
forbids
high
school
then
because
of
those
three
elements,
a
tremendous
stress
on
the
importance
of
the
opportunity
which
adolescence
creates.
now
if
they
are
placed
in
school,
the
record
shows
that
they
are
going
to
be
--
these
children
are
going
to
be
exposed
to
the
social
life
in
the
school,
be
it
public,
private,
or
parochial.
they
are
going
to
be
exposed
to
a
curriculum
much
of
which
they
must
religiously
reject
and
much
of
which
is
the
purpose
to
their
intended
life
as
growing
up
in
the
amish
faith
community.
mr.
william
b.
ball
mr.
justice
brennan,
those
are
all
elementary
schools.
the
amish
do
not
maintain
any
high
school
whatever
--
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes,
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
brennan.
now,
when
you
take
a
child
from
amish
life
at
adolescence
and
place
him
in
a
high
school,
he
is
naturally
going
to
be
exposed
to
those
values
which
his
parents’
religion
rejects,
is
going
to
be
exposed
in
those
ways
of
life
which
typify
high
school
today
and
this
alienation
which
is
abundant
testimony
in
the
record,
this
alienation
of
the
child
who
has
been
raised
as
he
has
a
right
to
be
raised
in
the
amish
faith
community
up
until
adolescence.
there
is
no
disagreement
with
that
on
the
part
of
the
state.
he
has
been
raised
in
that
atmosphere
up
until
then
to
be
suddenly
placed
in
a
high
school
where
there
is
different
dress,
different
speech,
very,
very
different
people
with
very,
very
different
backgrounds.
this
is
extremely
traumatic
to
the
person
and
this
alienation
is
psychologically
damaging
to
such
a
person.
mr.
william
b.
ball
in
the
eighth
grade,
our
particular
defendants
were
in
parochial
schools,
amish
parochial
schools
until
the
eighth
grade.
they
attend
an
eighth
grade,
they
attend
up
to
that
time
whether
they
are
in
a
public
or
an
amish
school
to
be
at
least
in
part
associated
with
other
amish
children.
the
amish
placed
a
tremendous
importance
of
task
coming
to
adolescence.
they
believe
that
it
is
at
that
time
in
one's
life
when
you
are
heading
toward
adult
baptism
and
when
the
whole
person
is
in
the
state
of
permanent
change
that
at
that
time
in
your
life,
the
influences
of
the
world
can
be
especially
deadly
to
the
amish
child.
i
think
adolescence
is
a
very
important
part
of
this
whole
thinking
of
the
amish
that
up
until
the
eighth
grade
in
those
earlier
years,
the
chance
or
the
temptations
to
become
a
worldly
person
and
the
imposition
of
values
in
another
school
system
may
have
far
less
impact
than
they
will
to
a
child
who
is
beyond
or
in
adolescence.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes,
this
is
correct.
the
amish
parochial
schools
are
amish
schools
and
the
children
--
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes,
in
fact
it
was
understood
that
this
prosecution
was
triggered
by
the
very
fact
that
as
the
record
shows
an
amish
one
to
eighth
grade
school
had
been
started.
mr.
william
b.
ball
now
these
children
--
mr.
william
b.
ball
there
is
a
number
--
many
amish
children
have
attended
public
schools
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes.
mr.
william
b.
ball
the
pattern
varies.
in
some
cases
they
have
been
mixed
in
with
others
and
some
where
it
had
been
perhaps
a
majority
of
amish
children
in
school.
mr.
william
b.
ball
in
the
high
school
level
it
would
be
a
very
much
broader
mix
and
at
the
time
of
high
school
the
child
is
then
in
the
amish
religion
being
prepared
for
a
complete
vocation
in
amish
life.
and
this
is
extremely
disrupted
to
that
vocation
and
secondly,
it
is
a
time
in
life
when
exposures
to
these
elements
are
going
to
have
a
very
serious
impact
upon
his
values.
he
will
have
been
raised
and
even
in
the
eighth
grade
in
the
eighth
year
essentially
in
an
amish
community
and
the
involvement
in
high
school
with
its
social
life
and
everything
else
is
going
to
be
destructive
of
his
faith.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes.
mr.
william
b.
ball
i
think
it
is
quite
a
close
analogy
mr.
chief
justice
burger
and
i
think
that
is
well
brought
out
by
the
way
in
the
brief
of
the
--
brief
amicus
curiae
in
this
case
by
the
synagogue
council
of
america
and
other
related
jewish
groups.
the
–-
i
would
like
to
comment
if
i
may
with
the
time
that
remains
to
discuss
the
danger
would
strike
which
a
state
has
said
it
is
faced
with,
if
these
amish
children
for
religious
reasons
are
permitted
to
not
attend
school
through
age
15.
one
has
to
ask
whether
the
state
with
its
very
ample
legal
research
resources,
why
they
never
placed
a
single
witness
on
the
stand
produce
any
documentary
evidence
at
all
once
rapid
with
any
study
which
would
give
color
to
the
charge
that
amish
non-attendance
threatens
some
compelling
state
interest.
all
the
evidence
on
that
point
of
compelling
state
interest
came
to
the
defense.
state
offered
really
two
points.
first
of
all
that
amish
non-attendance,
two
years,
one
year,
six
months,
whatever
it
might
be
threatens
of
all
things
the
states
establishing
and
maintaining
an
educational
system.
six
judges
below
and
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
denied
this
fact.
certainly,
here
there
is
no
danger
of
fraud.
very
few
people
could
show
what
the
amish
have
shown
that
is
to
say
a
unique
and
ancient
religious
tradition
and
religious
claim
that
the
obvious
nurture
and
protection
of
children
which
takes
place
in
the
amish
community
which
treasures
children,
the
whole
factor
of
training
in
life
that
are
useful
and
productive
vocation
and
no
casting
of
the
children
upon
the
community,
certainly
here
there
is
far
less
danger
at
all
or
disturbance
of
a
system
that
was
found
in
sherbert
versus
verner.
no
one
else’s
rights
are
harmed
by
virtue
of
amish
none
attendance.
and
here
i
am
reminded
of
the
statement
of
mr.
justice
brennan
in
dissenting
in
braunfeld
when
he
said
that
values
of
the
first
amendment
looked
primarily
towards
preservation
of
personal
liberty
rather
than
toward
fulfillment
of
collective
goals.
here
we
have
precisely
that
put
in
the
scope.
the
collective
goal
is
not
going
to
be
disturbed
by
the
fact
that
these
children
did
not
attend
school.
additionally,
that
i
have
to
reinforce
what
mr.
calhoun
said
a
few
moments
ago
when
he
pointed
to
the
court
the
findings
of
the
trial
court,
the
finding
of
the
circuit
court
and
the
determination
by
the
state
supreme
court
that
could
be
exercised
of
the
amish
religion
was
patently
here
involved.
that
the
state’s
action
enforcing
these
children
into
high
school
constitutes
a
denial
of
the
free
exercise
of
religion.
this
i
think
is
established
in
the
case
irrespective
of
what
may
be
brought
at
the
amish
religion.
the
remaining
question
then
becomes
one
of
a
compelling
state
interest
which
means
what
is
the
danger
to
the
state
and
certainly
it
is
not
in
the
general
enforcement
or
maintenance
of
an
educational
system.
now,
does
it
deny
the
child
free
choice?
does
it
deny
the
child
as
the
state
says
his
right
to
an
education?
there
is
national
consensus
that
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
at
page
32
to
this
effect
that
there
is
no
compelling
state
interest
reflected
in
state
compulsory
attendance
laws
in
having
children
attend
school
beyond
the
15th
birthday
and
this
seems
to
be
if
this
is
the
case
in
state
after
state
after
state
that
the
state
does
not
feel
that
a
child
needs
to
attend
school
beyond
15
then
it
seems
to
me
that
these
children
in
question
do
not
present
in
terms
of
their
own
rights
to
an
education
any
danger
to
any
compelling
state
interest.
we
have
produced
an
evidence
and
cited
in
our
brief
this
study
which
was
by
professor
john
hostetler
under
a
commission
from
the
u.s.
office
of
education
of
achievements
of
amish
children
and
standardized
testing
and
it
reveals
that
they
perform
well.
the
state
has
referred
to
prince
versus
massachusetts
in
its
argument
on
behalf
of
parens
patriae
but
we
have
been
able
to
show
i
think
quite
clearly
that
there
is
no
such
danger
to
these
children
as
was
involved
in
the
prince
case
whose
facts
were
that
of
a
child
hawking
religious
magazines
at
night
in
streets.
amish
life
is
a
gardener
of
nurture
of
children.
certainly,
the
attorney
general
is
not
telling
us
that
the
child
labor
laws
in
wisconsin
are
not
enforced
and
certainly
therefore
if
there
is
any
need
for
protection
in
that
direction,
the
state
of
wisconsin
is
very
able
to
afford
that
protection.
the
state
has
thought
loosely
about
the
disease
of
ignorance
and
opening
the
gateways
of
opportunity
to
these
children.
we
introduced
positive
evidence
which
shows
that
amish
education
produces
good
people.
we
cited
the
testimony
of
dr.
erickson
of
the
university
of
chicago
and
we
specifically
asked
him
questions
concerning
amish
education
which
he
had
very
carefully
studied
and
his
comment
was
this.
the
amish
definitely
provide
for
their
children
of
high
school
age
what
could
be
called
an
education.
remember
this
was
uncontroverted
by
anything
the
state
chose
to
put
in
the
record.
i
would
be
inclined
to
say
that
they
do
a
better
job
at
this
than
most
of
the
rest
of
us
do.
the
amish
are
in
a
fortunate
position
respecting
schooling
which
they
conduct
for
children
beyond
the
eighth
grade.
it
is
learning
by
doing,
an
ideal
system.
we
are
learning
that
current
education
is
detached
from
the
real
world
and
that
in
the
things
they
talk
about,
pupils
do
not
become
involved
or
have
real
responsibility.
the
lack
in
modern
education
of
a
clear
connection
between
learning
and
doing
is
responsible
for
much
of
the
student
actions
that
we
have
today.
we
asked
what
kind
of
people
these
are
and
we
put
the
sheriff
of
green
county
on
the
stand,
we
asked
him
question
after
question
after
question
about
those
crimes
of
violence
which
most
typical
typically
committed
by
young
people
today;
arson,
looting,
rape,
etcetera,
etcetera,
etcetera.
the
sheriff
gave
these
people
a
complete
bill
of
health.
they
have
never
been
known
for
the
commission
of
crime.
dr.
littell
an
authority
in
the
history
of
the
amish
people
stated
that
they
have
not
been
known
who
have
committed
a
felony
in
250
years
on
this
soil.
they
are
a
peaceable
people
and
an
asset
in
our
society,
not
in
terms
of
gross
national
product
or
the
building
of
missiles,
but
certainly
in
terms
–-
but
certainly
in
terms
of
the
goodness
that
they
have
afford
as
an
example
for
the
rest
of
our
society.
we
placed
the
welfare
director
on
the
stand,
the
welfare
director
of
green
county,
and
we
asked
him
whether
the
amish
take
care
of
their
old
people,
their
dependent
people
and
the
director
of
welfare
testified
that
the
amish
completely
take
care
of
themselves.
they
do
not
cast
their
burden
on
the
community.
they
do
not
have
people
on
relief
or
welfare.
they
do
not
have
their
aged
and
public
funds
for
the
aged.
i
think
that
we
are
talking
about
here
are
really
great
achievers.
they
have
been
in
the
education
business
for
300
years.
they
are
the
finest
natural
farmers
in
the
western
hemisphere.
you
go
up
--
members
of
the
court
you
go
up
to
lancaster
county
in
pennsylvania
and
if
you
were
to
see
these
people,
see
them
in
actuality,
you
would
find
young
men
who
are
heads
of
family
and
managers
of
large
farms,
experts
in
husbandry,
you
would
find
in
their
women
very
model
women,
managers
of
households,
very
fine
people.
i
think
that
it
is
quite
surprising
that
these
people
are
singled
out
as
not
having
an
education,
denying
their
people
of
education.
for
300
years,
these
people
have
done
superbly.
for
300
years
these
people
have
performed
very
well
in
our
society.
the
question
before
the
court
then
is
whether
the
state
may
destroy
because
that
is
what
it
will
come
to
if
these
children
are
forced
into
high
school,
a
peaceable,
self
sustaining
community,
250
years
on
this
soil
on
the
ground,
if
parents
in
that
community
cannot
send
their
children
on
account
of
a
clear
mandate
of
their
religion
to
one
or
two
years
of
high
school.
mr.
justice
stewart,
in
braunfeld
said
that
the
orthodox
jews
in
that
case
were
faced
with
a
cruel
choice.
a
far
cruel
choice
is
presented
in
this
case.
if
the
decision
of
this
court
is
against
the
amish,
i
fear
that
many
people
will
feel
that
this
court
has
indicted
our
nation
as
two
(inaudible)
to
allow
difference,
innocent
difference
to
exist
and
to
flourish
in
its
midst.
the
amish
did
not
come
here
as
fearful
supplicants
to
this
court.
they
come
here
with
confidence,
believing
in
this
court
as
there
brothers
in
justice,
in
love
and
goodness,
and
belief
in
constitutional
liberty.
thank
you.
