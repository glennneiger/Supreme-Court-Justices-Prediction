justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
an
issue
that
it
was
not
left
open
in
jackson
against
denno?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
wait
a
minute,
wait
a
minute.
what
you
are
in
sense
saying
or
what
you
are
saying
is
the
issue
of
voluntariness
must
be
presented
to
the
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
the
judge
has
passed
on
it
in
advance,
in
a
proper
manner?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
be
quite
satisfied
if
the
judge
just
said
i
think
the
voluntariness
is
--
i
find
it
to
be
voluntary
as
admissible
and
then
he
says
to
the
jury
you
must
find
the
contention
admissible
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
as
a
preliminary
matter
to
use?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
that
would
be
enough?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
that
would
be
enough,
why
would
it
not
enough
for
the
judge
to
say
there
is
enough
evidence
in
the
case
to
find
it
voluntary,
i
do
not
have
to
pass
on
it,
but
i
will
give
it
to
the
jury
and
single
that
out
and
say
you
must
find
this
voluntary
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
think
he
would
foreclose.
what
you
are
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
confession
must
be
found
voluntary
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
in
a
miranda
situation
before,
in
custody
statement
would
be
admissible,
there
must
be
a
finding
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
warnings
have
been
given,
etcetera,
and
there
is
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
there
was
a
waiver?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
it
does
not
need
to
be
reached,
but
would
not
a
holding
here
on
your
side
determine
that
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
follows
in
--
justice
byron
r.
white
oh!
sure
we
could
say
it.
that
surely
we
can
just
say
it
i
suppose,
but
what
about
the
courts,
what
about
suppression
hearing
in
a
fourth
amendment
case?
do
you
have
to
find
and
make
those
claims
beyond
a
reason
doubt?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
doubt
about
that.
now,
now
you
are
just
saying
that
happens
in
this
problem.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
issue
is
on
guilt
or
innocence
which
is
what
reasonable
doubt
applies
to
so
far
as
whether
he
committed
the
crime
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
whether
he
committed
the
crime
or
not
and
the
question
about
voluntariness
has
not
got
anything
to
do
with
whether
he
committed
a
crime.
the
jury
is
going
to
hear
some
evidence,
including
his
confession
perhaps
and
they
are
going
to
decide
whether
that
proves
that
he
committed
the
crime
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
now,
you
necessarily
say
that
because
it
is
involuntary,
that
is
untrue?
justice
byron
r.
white
well?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
may
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
even
there
is
a
voluntary
confession,
that
may
will
be
untrue?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
what
does
voluntariness
is
got
to
do
with
finding
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
justice
byron
r.
white
every
(voice
overlap)
fact
to
determine
whether
it
is
a
crime?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
whether
he
confessed
voluntarily?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
really
are
not
arguing
whether
it
is
really
related
to,
you
are
not
arguing
that
with
respect
to
the
standard
of
proof
as
to
guilt
or
innocence,
but
the
standard
of
proof
that
might
help
protect
the
constitutional
rights?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
i
got
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
does
go
to
truth
or
falsity?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
to
whether
or
not
it
might
be
a
factor
in
determining
whether
the
defining
of
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
an
issue
that
it
was
not
left
open
in
jackson
against
denno?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
wait
a
