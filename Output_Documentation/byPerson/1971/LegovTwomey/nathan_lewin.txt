mr.
nathan
lewin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
which
in
a
short
per
curiam
opinion
affirmed
the
district
court’s
denial
of
petitioner’s
application
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
petitioner
is
in
the
illinois
state
penitentiary,
serving
a
25
to
50-year
term
for
armed
robbery.
on
this
court’s
limited
grant
of
certiorari,
two
questions
are
presented,
both
interrelated
and
both
relating
for
the
procedure
used
under
illinois
law
by
the
illinois
trial
court
in
admitting
a
confession
made
by
the
petitioner
into
evidence
and
allowing
it
to
be
considered
by
the
jury.
mr.
nathan
lewin
it
is
an
issue
that
in
the
light
that
mr.
justice
black
adverted
to
in
jackson
v.
denno
in
its
dissenting
opinion,
it
was
left
open.
it
is
one
of
a
range
really
of
issues,
mr.
chief
justice
that
are
left
open
under
jackson
v.
denno.
what
it
presents
is
the
question
of
the
standard
of
proof
that
a
trial
judge
must
apply
when
under
a
state
procedure
he
and
he
alone
determines
the
voluntariness
of
a
confession.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan
that
is,
if
in
fact
the
first
question
were
decided
against
the
petitioner,
we
submit
and
our
contention
is
that
the
two
are
interrelated
that
if
in
fact
this
court
were
to
sustain
a
standard
less
than
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
for
a
trial
judge
making
such
a
finding,
it
should
constitutionally
require
that
at
the
very
least
the
jury
get
a
second
look
at
that
issue.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that
is
right,
we
think
that
is
what
would
be
constitutionally
required?
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
think
my
second
point
is
slightly
different
from
that
because
i
think,
as
your
honor
has
stated
the
position,
i
think
it
does
reflect
a
position
similar
to
that
of
the
state
in
this
case.
what
the
state
is
arguing
is
that
once
admitted
a
confession
may
only
be
considered
in
the
context
of
all
the
evidence
in
the
case.
our
contention
is
that
if
a
confession
is
admitted
must
still
be
singled
out
to
the
jury
and
it
must
then
be
asked
to
decide
the
question
of
voluntariness
vel
non
as
a
preliminary
fact
finding.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes
sir.
we
think
that
would
be
constitutionally
required
if
a
judge
were
permitted
to
apply
some
standard
less
than
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
to
his
determination.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
that
–-
mr.
nathan
lewin
that
instruction
we
think
would
be
constitutionally
sufficient.
of
course,
it
was
not
given
in
this
case
and
in
fact
that
issue
of
voluntariness
is
not
in
any
way
singled
out
for
the
jury
under
the
illinois
procedure.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
that
was
not
adverted
to
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
am
saying
that
only
mr.
justice
white,
if
he
is
permitted
to
pass
on
it
by
some
standard
less
than
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
in
other
words,
the
contention
i
am
making
is
that
either,
that
constitutionally,
someone
in
this
process
must
pass
upon
voluntariness
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
either
it
may
be
the
judge
and
if
that
is
true,
the
petitioner
is
satisfied,
if
he
alone
makes
that
decision
or
the
jury.
mr.
nathan
lewin
you
must
find
it
voluntary
beyond
reasonable
doubt?
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
for
the
petitioner’s
(voice
overlap)
i
think
that
is
right.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that
is
what
jackson
v.
denno
foreclosed.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
we
do
not
have
to
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
mr.
justice
white,
the
petitioner’s
position
in
this
case
is
that
the
court
need
not
go
--
need
not
reach
if
it
decides
not
to
the
question
whether
the
judge
must
necessarily
find
the
confession
voluntary
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
it
would
be
sufficient
if
someone
in
the
process
found
it
voluntary
beyond
reasonable
doubt
and
the
vice
of
the
illinois
procedure
is
that
there
is
no
one
in
entire
process
whoever
passed
it
on
voluntariness
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
essentially
the
state’s
argument
is
that
a
confession
is
like
any
other
evidence
--
the
finding
of
voluntariness
vel
non
is
to
a
confession
is
like
a
preliminary
fact
finding
as
to
whether
a
statement
is
for
example
spontaneous
utterance
so
to
be
an
exemption
of
the
hearsay
rule
or
whether
a
certain
document
is
the
best
evidence
under
the
best
evidence
rule
and
that
therefore
the
judge
and
judge
alone
may
make
that
finding.
he
makes
the
finding
on
the
basis
of
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
and
he
then
submits
that
evidence
to
the
jury
for
it
to
be
considered
along
with
all
other
evidence
in
the
case,
instructing
them
only
as
the
winship
case
now
requires
that
they
must
find
the
defending
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
on
all
the
evidence
in
the
case.
petitioner’s
contention
is
of
course
that
that
analogy
of
confession
to
any
other
evidence
is
plainly
unsound.
the
fact
that
this
court
even
discussed
the
question
much
less
that
it
decided
as
it
did
in
jackson
v.
denno
is
a
plain
indication
that
the
question
of
voluntariness
of
a
confession
because
it
involves
a
possible
infringement
upon
fifth
amendment
rights,
various
constitutional
dangers
working
in
the
background
requires
special
procedural
handling
as
a
constitutional
matter.
surely
it
would
not
have
presented
a
constitutional
issue
and
this
court
would
not
have
considered
it
if
a
state
say
new
york
simply
said,
well
at
the
spontaneous
declarations,
we
do
not
allow
a
judge
to
make
that
preliminary
finding.
we
just
have
the
jury
make
the
preliminary
factual
finding,
or
as
to
any
other
exemption
of
the
hearsay
rule.
if
a
state
had
done
so
that
would
present
no
constitutional
problem.
since
new
york
did
so
with
regard
to
confessions.
it
did
present
the
problem
considered
by
this
court
in
jackson
and
the
ruling
of
this
court
in
jackson
that
there
must
be
a
reliable
clear
cut
finding
on
the
issue
of
voluntariness
vel
no.
now,
we
submit
that
it
follows
from
the
jackson
decision
as
well
as
subsequent
decisions
in
related
areas
by
this
court
that
there
must
be
a
finding
on
the
issue
of
voluntariness
at
a
trial
that
a
confession
is
voluntary
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
now,
of
course
the
broadest
range
of
that
argument
is
to
say
that
the
judge
must
make
that
finding.
when
he
makes
that
initial
determination
required
under
jackson
v.
denno,
he
must
make
it
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
that
issue
need
not,
we
submit,
be
reached
in
this
case
because
in
this
case
and
under
the
illinois
procedure
there
is
no
one,
no
one
in
the
entire
process
against
the
defendant
whoever
makes
that
finding
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
consequently,
we
think
that
the
illinois
practice
is
invalid
even
under
the
opinion
of
the
chief
justice
as
circuit
judge
in
the
dc
court
of
appeals,
which
are
cited,
the
opinions
of
which
are
cited
in
our
brief.
in
the
clifton
case,
the
chief
justice
as
a
circuit
judge
did
say
and
we
reprinted
that
as
an
appendix
to
our
brief,
it
appears
on
page
6
(d)
that
it
is
one
thing
to
call
for
the
high
standard
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
from
the
ultimate
fact
finders
and
quite
another
to
ask
that
the
issue
be
resolved
preliminarily
by
the
judge
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
contrary
to
all
the
law
governing
admissibility
of
evidence.
mr.
nathan
lewin
only
to
the
extent
mr.
chief
justice
that
there
is
some
constitutional
danger
if
the
letter
had
been
ceased
in
violation
of
either
fourth
or
possibly
fifth
amendment
standards.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
where
there
is
no
constitutional
problem,
where
we
are
referring
simply
to
the
preliminary
questions
or
any,
not
even
preliminary
question,
just
any
ordinary
question
on
which
factual
issue
on
which
admissibility
depends
then
of
course
it
is
standard
procedure
and
we
do
not
contend
that
the
constitutional
requires
otherwise
that
the
judge
make
that
factual
finding,
he
alone
may
make
it
in
the
actions
of
the
jury,
then
permit
the
evidence
to
go
in
and
not
comment
any
further
on
it
to
the
jury
and
not
raise
those
underlying
factual
issues
to
the
jury
at
all.
mr.
nathan
lewin
as
they
see
fit
in
the
context
of
all
the
other
evidence.
but
where
the
evidence
that
sought
to
be
introduced
may
infringe
on
constitutional
rights,
may
in
some
way
have
been
unconstitutionally
obtained,
in
those
circumstances
we
think
that
the
finding
must
be
made
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
now,
as
to
confessions
both
under
this
court’s
miranda
decision
and
we
think
and
the
law
even
prior
to
miranda
it
was
clear
that
confessions,
admissions
made
out
of
court
by
a
defendant
in
custody
as
with
the
admission
in
this
case
are
ipso
facto
in
and
off
themselves,
declarations
obtained
or
made
by
a
waiver
of
a
constitutional
privilege.
essentially
any
defendant
who
makes
the
statement
after
he
is
arrested
and
the
court
was
clear
on
this
in
miranda
and
even
in
the
second
opinion
in
miranda
suggest
that
that
was
not
an
impermissible
reading
of
all
cases
or
permit
even
a
permissible
extension.
that
a
defendant
who
makes
a
statement
in
custody
is
in
substance
waiving
his
fifth
amendment
right
not
to
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well
–-
mr.
nathan
lewin
and
a
defendant
in
custody
at
least
and
certainly
under
miranda,
i
think
what
the
court
went
in
to
say
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well
i
think
in
miranda
of
course
the
court
relied
on
ground
on
bram
in
prior
cases.
i
think
mr.
justice
harlan
as
well
adverted
to
the
fact
that
saying
that
the
fifth
amendment
apply
to
custodial
interrogation,
may
be
a
permissible
extension,
although
he
disagreed
with
it
historically,
but
a
permissible
extension
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
i
think
that
government
in
the
--
at
least
the
federal
government
and
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief
in
the
westover
case
admitted
that
the
fifth
amendment
might
apply
to
in
custody
interrogations.
mr.
nathan
lewin
right.
mr.
nathan
lewin
right,
but
a
defendant
in
custody,
when
a
defendant
is
being
held
in
custody
and
he
then
makes
a
statement,
the
question
of
whether
it
compels
or
not
is
really
a
question
of
whether
he
and
it
is
very
close
i
think
to
the
border
of
whether
he
has
waived
the
fifth
amendment
right.
he
is
being
held
in
custody,
take
this
petition,
arrested
on
the
scene,
taken
down
to
the
station
house,
within
hours
he
claims
being
beaten
in
the
car,
being
beaten
at
the
police
station.
the
real
question
is,
assuming
he
had
some
constitutional
privilege
or
certainly
a
legal
privilege
to
remain
silent,
did
he
waive
that
privilege
in
making
the
statement,
he
did?
now,
we
think
that
issue,
the
question
of
whether
that
confession
should
be
considered
is
very
analogous
to
the
issue
of
a
waiver
of
a
constitutional
right
and
this
court
has
held
as
far
back
as
johnson
and
zerbst
that
courts
indulge
as
the
courts
had
every
reasonable
presumption
against
assuming
that
there
has
been
a
waiver
of
a
constitutional
right.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that
i
do
not
think
that
question
has
to
be
reached,
mr.
justice
white
in
a
square
coerced
confession.
mr.
nathan
lewin
(voice
overlap)i
think
a
holding
in
our
side
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
let
me
just
say.
i
think
the
fact
that
there
is
--
this
is
one
of
several
factors
which
i
think
bear
upon
this
case.
i
am
not
contending
that
that
in
and
of
itself
necessarily
determines
the
issue
in
the
case.
i
am
saying
that
the
question
of
voluntariness
vel
non
has
to
be
considered
against
the
background
of
this
being
very
likely
an
issue
of
whether
there
is
a
waiver
of
a
constitutional
right
as
to
which
the
court
did
say
in
miranda
and
as
to
which
it
is
said
in
other
constitutional
rights,
it
would
require
very
substantial
evidence.
now,
i
do
not
think
the
court
has
to
go
that
far
to
decide
the
coerced
confession
claim.
in
other
words,
one
can
say
because
coerced
confessions
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
our
initial
argument
is
that
one
would
have
to
make
those
findings
whenever
there
is
a
constitutional
issue,
but
alternatively
and
i
think
the
point
that
covers
this
case,
we
contend
that
one
need
only
make
one,
the
court
need
only
hold
in
this
case
that
one
must
make
those
findings
as
to
a
confession
case
because
confessions
are
particularly
devastating
in
the
context
of
a
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
nathan
lewin
on
a
motion
to
suppress
a
confession.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
moving
party
has
the
burden
of
proving
initial
illegality
on
a
motion
to
suppress.
that
we
think
is
just
not
true
when
you
are
talking
about
the
defendant
who
is
in
custody
and
whose
statement
had
been
taken
from
in
when
he
is
in
custody.
we
think
that
is
part
of
the
government’s
total
package
of
proof.
it
is
not
like
trying
to
prove
that
the
government
has
in
some
way
illegally
searched
where
there
is
a
presumption
that
a
search
is
legal
or
that
the
government
has
conducted
unlawful
eavesdropping
dropping
or
that
kind
of
thing.
whether
it
is
no
--
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
factual
background
from
which
one
can
just
conclude
that
the
government
is
engaged
in
anything
questionable.
here
the
government
indeed
and
here
and
i
think
that
is
a
principal
reason
why
the
burden
is
on
the
state
is
that
here
there
is
a
constitutional
right
involved.
i
mean,
whether
one
says
it
has
to
be
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
whether
miranda
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
there
are
two
answers
to
that
mr.
justice
stewart.
one
is
that
miranda
held
to
the
contrary.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
but
nonetheless
miranda
did
hold
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
but
miranda
did
hold
there
and
we
are
not
finding
here
that
the
absence
to
provide
warnings
or
all
the
new
procedural
rights
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
that
miranda
put
into
effect.
we
are
just
that
if
in
fact
there
is
a
fifth
amendment
right
then
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
waiver
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
nathan
lewin
a
man
who
is
in
custody
does
make
a
statement
is
at
least
waiving
the
right,
the
constitutional
right
to
be
silent.
he
has
a
legal
right
not
to
answer
questions
and
he
is
waiving
that
right
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
think
that
was
the
legal
right
not
to
answer
questions
that
existed
--
pre-existed
miranda,
but
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
that
there
was
a
right
not
to?
mr.
nathan
lewin
simply
not
respond?
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
know
but
they
are
circuit
cases
that
have
said
that.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
the
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
believe
that
the
papilino
(ph),
the
aplaken
(ph)
case
in
the
second
circuit
so
held
that
those
arrested
on
the
scene
had
a
legal
right
to
remain
silent
and
not
to
answer
questions.
mr.
nathan
lewin
in
the
second
circuit.
i
do
not
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
do
not
think,
mr.
justice
marshall
that
there
is
single
jurisdiction
that
is
held
that
the
burden
of
showing
that
a
confession
--
that
the
prosecution
wants
to
put
in.
a
statement
of
the
defendants
or
the
accused
that
the
prosecution
wants
to
put
in
that
the
burden
of
showing
that
to
be
illegal
is
on
the
defendant.
if
the
prosecution
wants
to
put
it
in,
it
has
some
burden
to
come
forward
and
show
that
that
statement
has
been
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
submit
it
could
simply
be
a
motion
to
exclude
at
the
trial
except
that
many
states
have
provided
procedures
under
which
these
matters
have
taken
care
of
prior
to
trial.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
government
is
putting
it
in.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
the
government
is
putting
it
in.
it
is
putting
the
in
accused
own
words
and
it
has
to
lay
the
foundation
for
being
able
to
use
that
evidence.
it
is
not
like
a
piece
of
physical
evidence
that
it
obtains
and
that
it
presumed
in
the
absence
of
any
showing
to
the
contrary
to
be
lawfully
obtained.
mr.
nathan
lewin
of
course
if
the
issue
is
not
raised
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
the
issue
of
voluntariness
is
not
raised
then
the
defendant
is
certainly
at
trial
waiving
any
objection
on
the
ground
of
non-voluntariness.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
and
the
defendant
we
think
under
all
of
rules,
i
think
that
all
jurisdictions
apply,
shifts
the
burden
back
to
the
government
by
showing
that
he
was
then
in
custody
and
by
simply
saying
this
was
obtained
involuntarily.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
must
admit
even
pre-miranda.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
defendant,
right,
the
defendant
then
make
some
showing.
i
mean,
even
if
a
court
would
have
put
the
burden,
going
forward
on
the
defendant,
and
i
think
that
certainly
legitimately
true,
the
defendant
must
at
least
either
assert,
move
in
some
way
personally
say
i
was
coerced.
mr.
nathan
lewin
and
state
some
facts
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
and
state
some
facts.
that
just
puts
the
burden
going
forward
though
on
the
defendant.
it
is
not
the
ultimate
burden
of
proof.
we
think
all
jurisdictions
at
least
put
the
burden
of
proof
via
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
on
the
government.
in
a
criminal
case
where
and
this
has
been
the
conclusion
not
merely
of
a
commentators
such
as
lord
devlin
who
is
quoted
in
our
brief,
but
in
fact
of
state
supreme
courts,
both
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
and
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
in
the
yough
and
keiser
cases
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
talk
about
the
devastating
effect
of
confessions
in
a
criminal
trial.
when
one
is
dealing
with
those
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
but
a
constitutional
rule,
we
submit,
cannot
be
made
for
an
eleven
eyewitness
case
nor
do
we
think
there
is
any
--
there
is
any
similar
or
analogous
constitutional
rule
that
would
be
appropriate.
on
the
other
hand
in
jackson
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
about
line-ups?
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
right.
but
not
--
well,
to
sum
it,
i
withdraw
that
right.
to
some
extent
that
goes
to
the
reliability
of
an
eyewitness.
mr.
nathan
lewin
but
jackson
indicated
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
we
think
this
court
in
jackson
certainly
recognized
that
the
reliability
of
a
confession
is
a
much
more
important
question
and
involves
constitutional,
in
fact,
there
is
a
question
of
constitutional
dimension.
the
procedure
surrounding
the
admissibility
of
confession
where
as
it
has
never
made
that
kind
of
suggestion
or
ruling
with
regard
to
the
various
other
kinds
of
evidence
that
may
be
very
damaging
because
as
the
court
recognized
in
jackson,
there
is
a
whole
complex
of
values
underlying
the
rules
against
coerced
confessions.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
i
think
a
constitutional
rule
applicable
to
house
arrest
confessions
would
be
applicable
to
that
case
as
well
and
the
only
rule
we
are
seeking
is
a
rule
as
to
standard
of
proof
and
again
a
rule
as
to
standard
of
proof
is
applicable
any
place
in
the
trial.
the
vice
of
the
illinois
procedure
is
that
no
one
in
the
entire
trial,
neither
the
judge
nor
the
jury
ever
decides
whether
this
confession
has
been
voluntary
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
so
that
means
that
there
is
a
man
in
this
petitioner’s
position,
for
example,
who
is
convicted
on
evidence
where
a
judge
may
simply
have
decided
by
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
a
confession
is
voluntary
then
submit
it
to
the
jury
with
all
the
other
evidence
in
the
case.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
and
that
is
exactly
what
is
possible
under
the
illinois
procedure,
that
a
judge
simply
says
by
preponderance
of
the
evidence
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
if
one;
there
is
a
constitutional
right
and
we
submit
miranda
indicates
that
there
is,
if
two;
every
necessary
fact
has
to
be
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
that
is
what
winship
says,
if
three;
as
this
courts
said
in
chapman,
in
where
there
is
a
constitutional
claim
it
is
important
that
the
conviction
rests
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
on
no
constitutional
error.
all
those
factors
we
submit
add
up
to
mean
that
in
a
trial,
in
a
criminal
trial
there
should
at
least
be
someone,
someone
along
that
entire
procedure
who
says
or
who
is
required
to
focus
on
the
question
and
says
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
this
confession
was
not
obtained
by
coercion.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well
i
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
i
am
sorry.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
mr.
nathan
lewin
it
may
be.
mr.
nathan
lewin
it
may
be
untrue.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
nathan
lewin
guilt,
at
every
element
of
the
offense
or
every
necessary
fact
as
this
court
stated
in
the
winship
has
to
be
found
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
not
just
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
right.
mr.
nathan
lewin
when
a
piece
of
evidence
is
as
important
to
the
question
of
guilt
or
innocence
as
a
confession,
we
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
that
is
right,
which
is
what
this
court,
although
did
not
talk
in
terms
of
standard
of
proof,
but
what
this
court
did
in
jackson.
it
said
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
there
is
nothing
jackson
--
there
is
nothing
in
the
due
process
clause
that
talks
about
whether
a
judge
or
jury
must
make
the
finding,
nonetheless
this
court
found,
concluded
that
in
order
to
be
sure
that
there
is
a
reliable
determination,
it
has
to
be
the
judge
who
makes
it.
we
think
that
that
the
very
same
hedge
or
protection
against
the
possibility
of
a
conviction
the
basis
of
an
involuntary
statement
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
applies
as
well
to
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
that
is
true
and
to
that
extent
it
would
support
saying
that
the
rule
should
be
the
kind
of
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
not,
your
honor,
because
it
simply
says
to
the
judge,
you
make
factual
determinations
on
this
issue
as
you
make
it
on
a
host
of
preliminary
or
underlying
factual
issues
relating
to
the
admission
of
evidence.
but
as
to
this
particular
issue,
you
do
it
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
in
other
words,
it
just
simply
applies
another
standard,
a
different
standard
to
this
particular
question
because
of
the
importance
of
the
constitutional
right.
it
does
not
in
any
way
change
the
judge
and
jury
function.
it
simply
says
that
the
judge
do
it
by
standard
“x.”
mr.
nathan
lewin
right.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no
more
odd
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
right,
no
more
odd
than
is
true
in
an
appeal
from
any
criminal
conviction
and
an
ultimate
sentence,
an
ultimate
finding
of
guilty
where
a
jury
may
find
a
defendant
guilty
and
this
happens
more
than
just
occasionally
and
a
court
of
appeals
reviewing
the
evidence,
applying
could
a
reasonable
man
find
this
defendant
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
a
court
of
appeals
reviewing
that
evidence
says
we
think
that
a
judgment
of
acquittal
should
have
been
entered
because
a
reasonable
man
could
not
find
the
defendant
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
so
all
that
such
a
rule
would
do
is
it
would
apply
the
very
same
standard
as
is
applied
to
guilt
or
innocence
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
question
of
voluntariness
of
the
confession.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
nathan
lewin
thank
you,
your
honor.
it
is
a
privilege.
mr.
nathan
lewin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
which
in
a
short
per
curiam
opinion
affirmed
the
district
court’s
denial
of
petitioner’s
application
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
petitioner
is
in
the
illinois
state
penitentiary,
serving
a
25
to
50-year
term
for
armed
robbery.
on
this
court’s
limited
grant
of
certiorari,
two
questions
are
presented,
both
interrelated
and
both
relating
for
the
procedure
used
under
illinois
law
by
the
illinois
trial
court
in
admitting
a
confession
made
by
the
petitioner
into
evidence
and
allowing
it
to
be
considered
by
the
jury.
mr.
nathan
lewin
it
is
an
issue
that
in
the
light
that
mr.
justice
black
adverted
to
in
jackson
v.
denno
in
its
dissenting
opinion,
it
was
left
open.
it
is
one
of
a
range
really
of
issues,
mr.
chief
justice
that
are
left
open
under
jackson
v.
denno.
what
it
presents
is
the
question
of
the
standard
of
proof
that
a
trial
judge
must
apply
when
under
a
state
procedure
he
and
he
alone
determines
the
voluntariness
of
a
confession.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan
that
is,
if
in
fact
the
first
question
were
decided
against
the
petitioner,
we
submit
and
our
contention
is
that
the
two
are
interrelated
that
if
in
fact
this
court
were
to
sustain
a
standard
less
than
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
for
a
trial
judge
making
such
a
finding,
it
should
constitutionally
require
that
at
the
very
least
the
jury
get
a
second
look
at
that
issue.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that
is
right,
we
think
that
is
what
would
be
constitutionally
required?
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
think
my
second
point
is
slightly
different
from
that
because
i
think,
as
your
honor
has
stated
the
position,
i
think
it
does
reflect
a
position
similar
to
that
of
the
state
in
this
case.
what
the
state
is
arguing
is
that
once
admitted
a
confession
may
only
be
considered
in
the
context
of
all
the
evidence
in
the
case.
our
contention
is
that
if
a
confession
is
admitted
must
still
be
singled
out
to
the
jury
and
it
must
then
be
asked
to
decide
the
question
of
voluntariness
vel
non
as
a
preliminary
fact
finding.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes
sir.
we
think
that
would
be
constitutionally
required
if
a
judge
were
permitted
to
apply
some
standard
less
than
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
to
his
determination.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
that
–-
mr.
nathan
lewin
that
instruction
we
think
would
be
constitutionally
sufficient.
of
course,
it
was
not
given
in
this
case
and
in
fact
that
issue
of
voluntariness
is
not
in
any
way
singled
out
for
the
jury
under
the
illinois
procedure.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
that
was
not
adverted
to
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
am
saying
that
only
mr.
justice
white,
if
he
is
permitted
to
pass
on
it
by
some
standard
less
than
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
in
other
words,
the
contention
i
am
making
is
that
either,
that
constitutionally,
someone
in
this
process
must
pass
upon
voluntariness
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
either
it
may
be
the
judge
and
if
that
is
true,
the
petitioner
is
satisfied,
if
he
alone
makes
that
decision
or
the
jury.
mr.
nathan
lewin
you
must
find
it
voluntary
beyond
reasonable
doubt?
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
for
the
petitioner’s
(voice
overlap)
i
think
that
is
right.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that
is
what
jackson
v.
denno
foreclosed.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
we
do
not
have
to
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
mr.
justice
white,
the
petitioner’s
position
in
this
case
is
that
the
court
need
not
go
--
need
not
reach
if
it
decides
not
to
the
question
whether
the
judge
must
necessarily
find
the
confession
voluntary
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
it
would
be
sufficient
if
someone
in
the
process
found
it
voluntary
beyond
reasonable
doubt
and
the
vice
of
the
illinois
procedure
is
that
there
is
no
one
in
entire
process
whoever
passed
it
on
voluntariness
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
essentially
the
state’s
argument
is
that
a
confession
is
like
any
other
evidence
--
the
finding
of
voluntariness
vel
non
is
to
a
confession
is
like
a
preliminary
fact
finding
as
to
whether
a
statement
is
for
example
spontaneous
utterance
so
to
be
an
exemption
of
the
hearsay
rule
or
whether
a
certain
document
is
the
best
evidence
under
the
best
evidence
rule
and
that
therefore
the
judge
and
judge
alone
may
make
that
finding.
he
makes
the
finding
on
the
basis
of
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
and
he
then
submits
that
evidence
to
the
jury
for
it
to
be
considered
along
with
all
other
evidence
in
the
case,
instructing
them
only
as
the
winship
case
now
requires
that
they
must
find
the
defending
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
on
all
the
evidence
in
the
case.
petitioner’s
contention
is
of
course
that
that
analogy
of
confession
to
any
other
evidence
is
plainly
unsound.
the
fact
that
this
court
even
discussed
the
question
much
less
that
it
decided
as
it
did
in
jackson
v.
denno
is
a
plain
indication
that
the
question
of
voluntariness
of
a
confession
because
it
involves
a
possible
infringement
upon
fifth
amendment
rights,
various
constitutional
dangers
working
in
the
background
requires
special
procedural
handling
as
a
constitutional
matter.
surely
it
would
not
have
presented
a
constitutional
issue
and
this
court
would
not
have
considered
it
if
a
state
say
new
york
simply
said,
well
at
the
spontaneous
declarations,
we
do
not
allow
a
judge
to
make
that
preliminary
finding.
we
just
have
the
jury
make
the
preliminary
factual
finding,
or
as
to
any
other
exemption
of
the
hearsay
rule.
if
a
state
had
done
so
that
would
present
no
constitutional
problem.
since
new
york
did
so
with
regard
to
confessions.
it
did
present
the
problem
considered
by
this
court
in
jackson
and
the
ruling
of
this
court
in
jackson
that
there
must
be
a
reliable
clear
cut
finding
on
the
issue
of
voluntariness
vel
no.
now,
we
submit
that
it
follows
from
the
jackson
decision
as
well
as
subsequent
decisions
in
related
areas
by
this
court
that
there
must
be
a
finding
on
the
issue
of
voluntariness
at
a
trial
that
a
confession
is
voluntary
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
now,
of
course
the
broadest
range
of
that
argument
is
to
say
that
the
judge
must
make
that
finding.
when
he
makes
that
initial
determination
required
under
jackson
v.
denno,
he
must
make
it
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
that
issue
need
not,
we
submit,
be
reached
in
this
case
because
in
this
case
and
under
the
illinois
procedure
there
is
no
one,
no
one
in
the
entire
process
against
the
defendant
whoever
makes
that
finding
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
consequently,
we
think
that
the
illinois
practice
is
invalid
even
under
the
opinion
of
the
chief
justice
as
circuit
judge
in
the
dc
court
of
appeals,
which
are
cited,
the
opinions
of
which
are
cited
in
our
brief.
in
the
clifton
case,
the
chief
justice
as
a
circuit
judge
did
say
and
we
reprinted
that
as
an
appendix
to
our
brief,
it
appears
on
page
6
(d)
that
it
is
one
thing
to
call
for
the
high
standard
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
from
the
ultimate
fact
finders
and
quite
another
to
ask
that
the
issue
be
resolved
preliminarily
by
the
judge
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
contrary
to
all
the
law
governing
admissibility
of
evidence.
mr.
nathan
lewin
only
to
the
extent
mr.
chief
justice
that
there
is
some
constitutional
danger
if
the
letter
had
been
ceased
in
violation
of
either
fourth
or
possibly
fifth
amendment
standards.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
where
there
is
no
constitutional
problem,
where
we
are
referring
simply
to
the
preliminary
questions
or
any,
not
even
preliminary
question,
just
any
ordinary
question
on
which
factual
issue
on
which
admissibility
depends
then
of
course
it
is
standard
procedure
and
we
do
not
contend
that
the
constitutional
requires
otherwise
that
the
judge
make
that
factual
finding,
he
alone
may
make
it
in
the
actions
of
the
jury,
then
permit
the
evidence
to
go
in
and
not
comment
any
further
on
it
to
the
jury
and
not
raise
those
underlying
factual
issues
to
the
jury
at
all.
mr.
nathan
lewin
as
they
see
fit
in
the
context
of
all
the
other
evidence.
but
where
the
evidence
that
sought
to
be
introduced
may
infringe
on
constitutional
rights,
may
in
some
way
have
been
unconstitutionally
obtained,
in
those
circumstances
we
think
that
the
finding
must
be
made
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
now,
as
to
confessions
both
under
this
court’s
miranda
decision
and
we
think
and
the
law
even
prior
to
miranda
it
was
clear
that
confessions,
admissions
made
out
of
court
by
a
defendant
in
custody
as
with
the
admission
in
this
case
are
ipso
facto
in
and
off
themselves,
declarations
obtained
or
made
by
a
waiver
of
a
constitutional
privilege.
essentially
any
defendant
who
makes
the
statement
after
he
is
arrested
and
the
court
was
clear
on
this
in
miranda
and
even
in
the
second
opinion
in
miranda
suggest
that
that
was
not
an
impermissible
reading
of
all
cases
or
permit
even
a
permissible
extension.
that
a
defendant
who
makes
a
statement
in
custody
is
in
substance
waiving
his
fifth
amendment
right
not
to
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well
–-
mr.
nathan
lewin
and
a
defendant
in
custody
at
least
and
certainly
under
miranda,
i
think
what
the
court
went
in
to
say
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well
i
think
in
miranda
of
course
the
court
relied
on
ground
on
bram
in
prior
cases.
i
think
mr.
justice
harlan
as
well
adverted
to
the
fact
that
saying
that
the
fifth
amendment
apply
to
custodial
interrogation,
may
be
a
permissible
extension,
although
he
disagreed
with
it
historically,
but
a
permissible
extension
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
i
think
that
government
in
the
--
at
least
the
federal
government
and
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief
in
the
westover
case
admitted
that
the
fifth
amendment
might
apply
to
in
custody
interrogations.
mr.
nathan
lewin
right.
mr.
nathan
lewin
right,
but
a
defendant
in
custody,
when
a
defendant
is
being
held
in
custody
and
he
then
makes
a
statement,
the
question
of
whether
it
compels
or
not
is
really
a
question
of
whether
he
and
it
is
very
close
i
think
to
the
border
of
whether
he
has
waived
the
fifth
amendment
right.
he
is
being
held
in
custody,
take
this
petition,
arrested
on
the
scene,
taken
down
to
the
station
house,
within
hours
he
claims
being
beaten
in
the
car,
being
beaten
at
the
police
station.
the
real
question
is,
assuming
he
had
some
constitutional
privilege
or
certainly
a
legal
privilege
to
remain
silent,
did
he
waive
that
privilege
in
making
the
statement,
he
did?
now,
we
think
that
issue,
the
question
of
whether
that
confession
should
be
considered
is
very
analogous
to
the
issue
of
a
waiver
of
a
constitutional
right
and
this
court
has
held
as
far
back
as
johnson
and
zerbst
that
courts
indulge
as
the
courts
had
every
reasonable
presumption
against
assuming
that
there
has
been
a
waiver
of
a
constitutional
right.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that
i
do
not
think
that
question
has
to
be
reached,
mr.
justice
white
in
a
square
coerced
confession.
mr.
nathan
lewin
(voice
overlap)i
think
a
holding
in
our
side
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
let
me
just
say.
i
think
the
fact
that
there
is
--
this
is
one
of
several
factors
which
i
think
bear
upon
this
case.
i
am
not
contending
that
that
in
and
of
itself
necessarily
determines
the
issue
in
the
case.
i
am
saying
that
the
question
of
voluntariness
vel
non
has
to
be
considered
against
the
background
of
this
being
very
likely
an
issue
of
whether
there
is
a
waiver
of
a
constitutional
right
as
to
which
the
court
did
say
in
miranda
and
as
to
which
it
is
said
in
other
constitutional
rights,
it
would
require
very
substantial
evidence.
now,
i
do
not
think
the
court
has
to
go
that
far
to
decide
the
coerced
confession
claim.
in
other
words,
one
can
say
because
coerced
confessions
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
our
initial
argument
is
that
one
would
have
to
make
those
findings
whenever
there
is
a
constitutional
issue,
but
alternatively
and
i
think
the
point
that
covers
this
case,
we
contend
that
one
need
only
make
one,
the
court
need
only
hold
in
this
case
that
one
must
make
those
findings
as
to
a
confession
case
because
confessions
are
particularly
devastating
in
the
context
of
a
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
nathan
lewin
on
a
motion
to
suppress
a
confession.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
moving
party
has
the
burden
of
proving
initial
illegality
on
a
motion
to
suppress.
that
we
think
is
just
not
true
when
you
are
talking
about
the
defendant
who
is
in
custody
and
whose
statement
had
been
taken
from
in
when
he
is
in
custody.
we
think
that
is
part
of
the
government’s
total
package
of
proof.
it
is
not
like
trying
to
prove
that
the
government
has
in
some
way
illegally
searched
where
there
is
a
presumption
that
a
search
is
legal
or
that
the
government
has
conducted
unlawful
eavesdropping
dropping
or
that
kind
of
thing.
whether
it
is
no
--
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
factual
background
from
which
one
can
just
conclude
that
the
government
is
engaged
in
anything
questionable.
here
the
government
indeed
and
here
and
i
think
that
is
a
principal
reason
why
the
burden
is
on
the
state
is
that
here
there
is
a
constitutional
right
involved.
i
mean,
whether
one
says
it
has
to
be
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
whether
miranda
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
there
are
two
answers
to
that
mr.
justice
stewart.
one
is
that
miranda
held
to
the
contrary.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
but
nonetheless
miranda
did
hold
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
but
miranda
did
hold
there
and
we
are
not
finding
here
that
the
absence
to
provide
warnings
or
all
the
new
procedural
rights
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
that
miranda
put
into
effect.
we
are
just
that
if
in
fact
there
is
a
fifth
amendment
right
then
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
waiver
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
nathan
lewin
a
man
who
is
in
custody
does
make
a
statement
is
at
least
waiving
the
right,
the
constitutional
right
to
be
silent.
he
has
a
legal
right
not
to
answer
questions
and
he
is
waiving
that
right
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
think
that
was
the
legal
right
not
to
answer
questions
that
existed
--
pre-existed
miranda,
but
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
that
there
was
a
right
not
to?
mr.
nathan
lewin
simply
not
respond?
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
know
but
they
are
circuit
cases
that
have
said
that.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
the
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
believe
that
the
papilino
(ph),
the
aplaken
(ph)
case
in
the
second
circuit
so
held
that
those
arrested
on
the
scene
had
a
legal
right
to
remain
silent
and
not
to
answer
questions.
mr.
nathan
lewin
in
the
second
circuit.
i
do
not
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
do
not
think,
mr.
justice
marshall
that
there
is
single
jurisdiction
that
is
held
that
the
burden
of
showing
that
a
confession
--
that
the
prosecution
wants
to
put
in.
a
statement
of
the
defendants
or
the
accused
that
the
prosecution
wants
to
put
in
that
the
burden
of
showing
that
to
be
illegal
is
on
the
defendant.
if
the
prosecution
wants
to
put
it
in,
it
has
some
burden
to
come
forward
and
show
that
that
statement
has
been
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
submit
it
could
simply
be
a
motion
to
exclude
at
the
trial
except
that
many
states
have
provided
procedures
under
which
these
matters
have
taken
care
of
prior
to
trial.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
government
is
putting
it
in.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
the
government
is
putting
it
in.
it
is
putting
the
in
accused
own
words
and
it
has
to
lay
the
foundation
for
being
able
to
use
that
evidence.
it
is
not
like
a
piece
of
physical
evidence
that
it
obtains
and
that
it
presumed
in
the
absence
of
any
showing
to
the
contrary
to
be
lawfully
obtained.
mr.
nathan
lewin
of
course
if
the
issue
is
not
raised
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
the
issue
of
voluntariness
is
not
raised
then
the
defendant
is
certainly
at
trial
waiving
any
objection
on
the
ground
of
non-voluntariness.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
and
the
defendant
we
think
under
all
of
rules,
i
think
that
all
jurisdictions
apply,
shifts
the
burden
back
to
the
government
by
showing
that
he
was
then
in
custody
and
by
simply
saying
this
was
obtained
involuntarily.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
must
admit
even
pre-miranda.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
defendant,
right,
the
defendant
then
make
some
showing.
i
mean,
even
if
a
court
would
have
put
the
burden,
going
forward
on
the
defendant,
and
i
think
that
certainly
legitimately
true,
the
defendant
must
at
least
either
assert,
move
in
some
way
personally
say
i
was
coerced.
mr.
nathan
lewin
and
state
some
facts
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
and
state
some
facts.
that
just
puts
the
burden
going
forward
though
on
the
defendant.
it
is
not
the
ultimate
burden
of
proof.
we
think
all
jurisdictions
at
least
put
the
burden
of
proof
via
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
on
the
government.
in
a
criminal
case
where
and
this
has
been
the
conclusion
not
merely
of
a
commentators
such
as
lord
devlin
who
is
quoted
in
our
brief,
but
in
fact
of
state
supreme
courts,
both
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
and
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
in
the
yough
and
keiser
cases
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
talk
about
the
devastating
effect
of
confessions
in
a
criminal
trial.
when
one
is
dealing
with
those
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
but
a
constitutional
rule,
we
submit,
cannot
be
made
for
an
eleven
eyewitness
case
nor
do
we
think
there
is
any
--
there
is
any
similar
or
analogous
constitutional
rule
that
would
be
appropriate.
on
the
other
hand
in
jackson
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
about
line-ups?
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
right.
but
not
--
well,
to
sum
it,
i
withdraw
that
right.
to
some
extent
that
goes
to
the
reliability
of
an
eyewitness.
mr.
nathan
lewin
but
jackson
indicated
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
we
think
this
court
in
jackson
certainly
recognized
that
the
reliability
of
a
confession
is
a
much
more
important
question
and
involves
constitutional,
in
fact,
there
is
a
question
of
constitutional
dimension.
the
procedure
surrounding
the
admissibility
of
confession
where
as
it
has
never
made
that
kind
of
suggestion
or
ruling
with
regard
to
the
various
other
kinds
of
evidence
that
may
be
very
damaging
because
as
the
court
recognized
in
jackson,
there
is
a
whole
complex
of
values
underlying
the
rules
against
coerced
confessions.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
i
think
a
constitutional
rule
applicable
to
house
arrest
confessions
would
be
applicable
to
that
case
as
well
and
the
only
rule
we
are
seeking
is
a
rule
as
to
standard
of
proof
and
again
a
rule
as
to
standard
of
proof
is
applicable
any
place
in
the
trial.
the
vice
of
the
illinois
procedure
is
that
no
one
in
the
entire
trial,
neither
the
judge
nor
the
jury
ever
decides
whether
this
confession
has
been
voluntary
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
so
that
means
that
there
is
a
man
in
this
petitioner’s
position,
for
example,
who
is
convicted
on
evidence
where
a
judge
may
simply
have
decided
by
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
a
confession
is
voluntary
then
submit
it
to
the
jury
with
all
the
other
evidence
in
the
case.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
and
that
is
exactly
what
is
possible
under
the
illinois
procedure,
that
a
judge
simply
says
by
preponderance
of
the
evidence
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
if
one;
there
is
a
constitutional
right
and
we
submit
miranda
indicates
that
there
is,
if
two;
every
necessary
fact
has
to
be
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
that
is
what
winship
says,
if
three;
as
this
courts
said
in
chapman,
in
where
there
is
a
constitutional
claim
it
is
important
that
the
conviction
rests
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
on
no
constitutional
error.
all
those
factors
we
submit
add
up
to
mean
that
in
a
trial,
in
a
criminal
trial
there
should
at
least
be
someone,
someone
along
that
entire
procedure
who
says
or
who
is
required
to
focus
on
the
question
and
says
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
this
confession
was
not
obtained
by
coercion.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well
i
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
i
am
sorry.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
mr.
nathan
lewin
it
may
be.
mr.
nathan
lewin
it
may
be
untrue.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
nathan
lewin
guilt,
at
every
element
of
the
offense
or
every
necessary
fact
as
this
court
stated
in
the
winship
has
to
be
found
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
not
just
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
right.
mr.
nathan
lewin
when
a
piece
of
evidence
is
as
important
to
the
question
of
guilt
or
innocence
as
a
confession,
we
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
that
is
right,
which
is
what
this
court,
although
did
not
talk
in
terms
of
standard
of
proof,
but
what
this
court
did
in
jackson.
it
said
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
there
is
nothing
jackson
--
there
is
nothing
in
the
due
process
clause
that
talks
about
whether
a
judge
or
jury
must
make
the
finding,
nonetheless
this
court
found,
concluded
that
in
order
to
be
sure
that
there
is
a
reliable
determination,
it
has
to
be
the
judge
who
makes
it.
we
think
that
that
the
very
same
hedge
or
protection
against
the
possibility
of
a
conviction
the
basis
of
an
involuntary
statement
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
applies
as
well
to
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
that
is
true
and
to
that
extent
it
would
support
saying
that
the
rule
should
be
the
kind
of
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
not,
your
honor,
because
it
simply
says
to
the
judge,
you
make
factual
determinations
on
this
issue
as
you
make
it
on
a
host
of
preliminary
or
underlying
factual
issues
relating
to
the
admission
of
evidence.
but
as
to
this
particular
issue,
you
do
it
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
in
other
words,
it
just
simply
applies
another
standard,
a
different
standard
to
this
particular
question
because
of
the
importance
of
the
constitutional
right.
it
does
not
in
any
way
change
the
judge
and
jury
function.
it
simply
says
that
the
judge
do
it
by
standard
“x.”
mr.
nathan
lewin
right.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no
more
odd
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
right,
no
more
odd
than
is
true
in
an
appeal
from
any
criminal
conviction
and
an
ultimate
sentence,
an
ultimate
finding
of
guilty
where
a
jury
may
find
a
defendant
guilty
and
this
happens
more
than
just
occasionally
and
a
court
of
appeals
reviewing
the
evidence,
applying
could
a
reasonable
man
find
this
defendant
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
a
court
of
appeals
reviewing
that
evidence
says
we
think
that
a
judgment
of
acquittal
should
have
been
entered
because
a
reasonable
man
could
not
find
the
defendant
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
so
all
that
such
a
rule
would
do
is
it
would
apply
the
very
same
standard
as
is
applied
to
guilt
or
innocence
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
question
of
voluntariness
of
the
confession.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
nathan
lewin
thank
you,
your
honor.
it
is
a
privilege.
