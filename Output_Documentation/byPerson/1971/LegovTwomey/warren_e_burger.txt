chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
number
5037,
lego
against
twomey.
mr.
lewin
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
just
to
be
sure
that
i
have
it
in
focus.
this
case
presents
the
issue
left
open
in
jackson
v.
denno?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
i
understand
you
to
say
in
effect
on
that
point
that
a
confession
in
this
context
is
like
any
other
piece
of
evidence?
once
it
is
submitted
to
the
jury
it
is
submitted
to
the
jury
to
be
evaluated
along
with
all
the
other
evidence
and
by
the
same
standards.
that
is
your
second
point?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
did
not
mean
to
include
that
--
include
that
in
my
hypothetical.
you
mean
that
this
would
be
a
special
instruction
in
addition
to
the
general
credibility
instruction?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
be
sufficient
for
these
purposes
if
hypothetically
the
instruction
was
that
when
you
come
to
consider
the
confession
which
has
been
admitted
in
evidence,
you
will
bear
in
mind
that
as
with
other
elements,
it
must
find
this
voluntary
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
would
be
enough?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
lewin,
suppose
the
evidence,
let
us
avoid
the
word
confession
for
the
moment,
but
suppose
a
piece
of
evidence
was
offered
by
the
prosecution
in
the
form
of
a
letter
written
by
the
defendant
to
some
third
person
which
contained
the
essence
of
a
confession,
would
you
say
that
must
fall
under
this
same
rule?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
us
assuming
that
the
recipient
turns
it
over
to
prosecution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
jury
can
accept
it
or
reject
it
as
they
see
fit
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
single
out
any
other
kinds
of
evidence
that
are
devastating
as
you
put
it?
what
about
the
eleven
eyewitnesses?
is
that
devastating
on
the
defendant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
the
same
with
the
reliability
of
a
confession?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
tests
one
of
your
points
through
the
hypothetical.
you
put
the
emphasis,
of
course,
on
in
custody
statements.
suppose
you
have
a
situation
where
a
man
has
robbed
a
supermarket
and
he
is
a
caught
right
almost
on
the
scene,
the
officers
have
him
in
custody,
he
has
got
the
loot
in
his
hands
and
while
they
are
waiting
for
the
car
to
come
and
take
him
away,
someone
of
the
citizens
standing
by
and
said
why
did
you
do
this?
and
his
answer
is
i
needed
the
money.
there
is
certainly
in
that
context
that
admission
would
be
rather
devastating,
would
it
not?
would
you
apply
all
these
standards
that
you
list
to
that
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
put
an
emphasis
mr.
lewin
on
simply
that
this
simply,
i
think
you
have
said
in
effect
what
the
standard
is
to
be
used
by
the
trial
judge
in
evaluating
the
admissibility.
are
there
some
other
collateral
consequences
that
are
involved
when
you
come
to
review
on
appeal?
is
it
not
much
easier
for
appellate
courts
to
pass
on
the
judge’s
determination
of
voluntariness
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
than
to
have
the
judge
make
a
determination
merely
whether
jury
could
reasonably
find
that
the
confession
was
voluntary?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
does
that
do
considerable
as
mr.
justice
black
suggested
in
his
separate
opinion
to
take
the
fact
finding
function
away
from
the
jury?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
collateral
consequence
i
speak
of
is
that
an
appellate
court,
looking
at
that
after
the
event,
never
having
seen
any
of
the
witnesses
can
very
easily
say
that
trial
judge
could
not
have
reasonably
found
this
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
to
be
voluntary
confession
even
though
a
juror
of
twelve
people
have
found
it
to
be
voluntary
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
rather
in
odd
circumstance,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
we
believe
in
the
jury
system?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.

zagel.
