stewart
i
do
not
understand
that.
justice
potter
stewart
the
fifth
amendment
right
is
a
right
against
compulsory
self-incrimination?
justice
potter
stewart
you
state
as
part
of
miranda?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
is
what
miranda
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
other
cases
have
held
that
compelled
confessions
come
under
the
language
of
the
fifth
amendment,
but
only
compelled
confession?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
as
much
have
just
told
us?
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
no
--
the
constitutional
protection
is
against
involuntary
protections
in
a
confession.
if
a
person
confesses
voluntarily,
there
is
no
waiver
of
anything,
there
is
no
constitutional
issue
involved?
justice
potter
stewart
well
this
is
a
pre-miranda
case,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
miranda?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
the
waiver
would
come
in
if
the
man
said
yes
this
was
an
involuntary
confession,
but
i
now
waive
my
right
to
be
excluded
from
evidence,
that
would
be
a
waiver.
it
is
quite
different
from
this?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
said
in
miranda
for
i
think
the
first
time?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
know
of
any
case
that
said
so
before
miranda?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
to
be
understood
if
you
could?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
second
circuit?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
certainly
as
a
matter
of
evidence
it
is
admissible,
let
us
say
it
is
a
well-recognized
exception
to
the
hearsay
rule?
justice
potter
stewart
the
government
has
no
burden
at
all.
it
is
just
offers
it
and
it
is
up
to
the
defendant
to
show
why
it
should
be
excluded
because
as
i
said
as
matter
of
evidence
it
is
perfectly
admissible?
justice
potter
stewart
after
miranda
that
maybe
true,
this
is
a
pre-miranda
case?
justice
potter
stewart
you
can
say
it
is
the
defendant’s
duty
to
show
that
for
some
reason
or
another
it
is
inadmissible
and
the
reason
is
that
it
was
coerced
or
involuntary,
otherwise
it
is
as
a
matter
of
the
law
of
evidence,
it
is
clearly
admissible.
it
is
a
well
recognized
exemption
to
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
yes.
then
so
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
coerced?
justice
potter
stewart
you
do
have
rule
about
eyewitnesses,
you
have
waived?
justice
potter
stewart
you
do
have
a
constitutional
rule
about
eyewitness?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
well
that
is
what
eyewitnesses
are
in
fact?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
assuming
(inaudible)
on
that?
justice
potter
stewart
the
constitutional
error
might
be
something
other
than
the
wrongful
admission
of
evidence
in
the
case?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
are
not,
fairly
in
the
chapman
area
dealing
with
the
weight
of
evidence?
justice
potter
stewart
it
might
be
the
manner
or
method
of
trial
or
it
might
be
comment
by
the
prosecutor
on
the
defendant’s
failure
to
testify,
it
might
be
any
other
ordinary
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
different
constitutional
errors.
you
are
not
dealing
only
what
is
the
wrongfully
admitted
evidence
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
schipani
opinion?
justice
potter
stewart
the

weinstein?
justice

who
was

have
you
analyzed
the
analysis
of
the
mathematical
laws
of
probabilities
contained
in
that
opinion?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
then
the
50
times
95
comes
out
to
50

justice

stewart
it
gives
a
valid
analysis
of
this
