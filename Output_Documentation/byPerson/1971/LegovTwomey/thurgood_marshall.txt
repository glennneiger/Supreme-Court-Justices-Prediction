mr.
lewin,
my
problem
is
that
you
agree
with
the
general
proposition
there
when
you
file
a
motion
the
burden
is
on
you,
the
filing
of
the
motion.
two,
you
file
a
motion
and
say
that
this
confession
should
be
suppressed
which
confession
on
its
face
has
used
the
language
that,
if
given
no
promises
no
threats
and
everything
and
it
is
perfectly
valid
on
its
face.
i
can
see
right
clearly
that
at
that
stage
somebody
got
to
move.
but
have
you
put
--
where
do
you
shift
the
burden
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
do
we
call
it
a
motion
to
suppress?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what
you
are
saying
is
the
motion
to
suppress
or
the
motion
exclude,
all
it
says
is
that
we
do
not
think
the
government
has
the
right
to
put
this
in
so
the
government
must
show
us
why
it
is
in?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that
is
your
basis,
that
is
why
you
need
the
fifth
amendment.
i
see
now.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
know
the
catch
is
tough,
but
i
do
not
agree
that
they
have
a
burden
to
show
it.
they
only
have
a
burden
show
if
the
defendant
raises
the
question.
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
rogers
and
richmond
also
said
that
your
instruction
about
probable
truth
of
lawsuit
is
gone
too?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
say
that
probable
truth
and
falsity
was
not
in
rogers
and
richmond?
justice
thurgood
marshall
please
do
not
say
it
because
i
am
looking
at
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
does
your
instruction
say
that
you
decide
through
the
falsity?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
you
said
that
was
specific?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
that
is
truth
and
falsity,
is
it
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
the
rogers
and
richmond
says
that
is
not
enough
then
that
is
not
enough?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
it
did
not
validate
the
instruction
of
the
jury
in
illinois
because
of
the
connecticut
case
that
i
agree
with?
