mr.
james
b.
zagel
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
i
first
ought
to
clarify
to
some
extent
the
illinois
procedure
with
respect
to
confessions,
probably
because
the
record
in
this
is
somewhat
a
typical.
under
illinois
law
the
initial
determination
of
voluntariness
is
made
by
the
trial
court.
by
statute
the
burden
of
proof
on
voluntariness
is
placed
on
the
prosecution.
the
statute
does
not
declare
what
that
burden
of
proof
is.
it
simply
states
that
the
prosecution
shall
prove
voluntariness.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
that
was
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes,
that
has
always
been
true.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
and
it
still
true.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
so
of
course
the
issue
is
to
whether
it
is
permissible
to
place
a
burden
on
the
defendant
is
not
really
before
the
court.
secondly,
ordinarily
in
the
criminal
case
the
issue
of
that
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
outside
the
presence.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
and
that
has
always
been
the
procedure
in
illinois.
the
illinois
follows
in
effect
the
orthodox
rule
and
has
done
so.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
no,
that
is
true.
there
was
a
pre-trial
motion
to
suppress
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury,
in
fact,
before
being
tendered
intent
these
issues,
they
are
usually
decided
along
before.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
before
the
jury
is
impaneled.
they
usually
decide
it
well
in
advance
of
trial.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes,
yes.
however
at
the
trial
itself,
a
confession
and
jury
specifically
directed
to
the
consideration
of
a
confession,
there
is
a
special
confession
instruction.
it
was
not
given
in
this
case
because
it
was
not
requested,
but
the
standard
procedure
under
illinois
is
for
the
jury
to
receive
an
instruction
telling
them
that
they
have
to
judge
the
way
that
the
confession
in
light
of
the
circumstances
that
it
is
making
and
in
some
detail.
now,
it
is
true
that
that
is
not
a
consideration
of
voluntariness.
the
jury
is
not
told
you
must
consider
whether
the
confession
is
voluntary.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
it
does
go
to
truth
and
falsity.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes.
that
is
the
standard
illinois
practice.
the
petitioner
in
attacking
that
practice
takes
basically
two
separate
positions.
his
first
is
that
in
any
case
where
the
constitutional
acquisition
or
constitutional
legality
of
the
acquisition
of
evidence
is
a
question,
it
is
the
burden
of
the
prosecution
to
prove
that
it
constitutionally
acquired
the
evidence
and
it
is
the
burden
that
they
must
sustain
by
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
now,
i
would
point
out
and
it
is
been
alluded
to
that
there
a
considerable
amount
of
precedent
generally
against
that
rule
on
search
and
seizure
cases.
the
federal
rule
does
not
place
the
burden
on
the
prosecution
in
cases
where
there
is
a
warrant.
there
are
many
states
that
place
the
burden
on
the
defense,
in
all
cases
where
illegality
of
search
and
seizures
challenged.
that
is
true
in
illinois
incidentally
by
statute,
a
statute
that
immediately
follows
the
one
on
confessions
deals
with
motion
to
suppress
evidence
illegally
seized.
i
might
also
point
out
that
in
the
few
cases
in
which
this
court
has
spoken
on
the
subject
of
burden
and
those
have
been
bumper
versus
north
carolina
on
the
burden
of
proof
to
establish
consent
search;
and
miranda
versus
arizona
on
the
burden
of
proof
to
establish
waiver;
and
in
united
states
versus
wade
on
the
burden
of
proof
to
establish
an
independent
basis
of
identification
when
there
is
a
primary
legality,
in
none
of
those
cases
has
this
court
adopted
a
reasonable
doubt
standard.
the
standard
is
simply
burden
of
proof
in
consent
cases.
in
miranda,
the
language
was
heavy
burden.
in
united
states
versus
wade,
the
language
was
clear
on
convincing
evidence.
essentially
its
petitioner’s
first
point
that
the
constitutional
nature
of
the
constitutional
issues
involved
make
these
questions
as
special.
i
would
point
out
that
only
if
you
take
a
very
limited
tactical
view
of
the
criminal
trial,
they
are
made
particularly
special.
questions
of
the
admissibility
of
hearsay
are
usually
of
extreme
importance
in
criminal
trial.
i
point
out
that,
for
example,
it
s
not
the
burden
of
the
prosecution
to
prove
that
conspiracy
exists
and
to
prove
it
exists
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
before
the
declaration
of
the
co-conspirator
can
be
admitted
into
evidence.
and
the
question
of
accomplices
which
is
a
vital
question
in
most
criminal
trials
where
there
is
accomplice
evidence,
it
is
the
burden
of
the
defendant
to
prove
witness
is
an
accomplice
and
that
is
particularly
vital
burden
since
that
very
often
is
the
difference
between
a
directed
verdict
of
acquittal
and
a
conviction
on
the
other
hand.
furthermore,
i
think
that
there
is
a
confusion
and
it
runs
through
all
of
the
arguments
of
the
petitioner,
between
the
purpose
served
as
a
reasonable
doubt
rule
and
the
purpose
served
by
the
exclusionary
rules.
it
is
clear
to
me
at
least
that
the
purposes
of
the
exclusionary
rule
are
in
entirely
separate
and
apart
from
the
determination
of
guilt
or
innocence.
indeed
with
some
of
the
exclusionary
rules,
mostly
search
and
seizure,
their
existence
cannot
be
squared
with
policies
promoting
the
accuracy
of
fact-finding.
furthermore,
the
reasonable
doubt
rule,
in
all
of
its
manifestations,
every
single
one
is
a
rule
that
is
concerned
solely
with
the
weight
of
the
evidence
in
a
criminal
trial
and
not
with
the
admissibility
of
evidence
and
chapman
upon
which
petitioner
relies
very
heavily
does
not
change
this.
first
of
all
chapman
is
a
case
that
applies
only
when
the
existence
of
a
constitutional
error
has
been
established
and
it
says
nothing
about
the
burden
of
proof
to
establish
the
existence
of
that
error.
second
of
all,
chapman
is
essentially
an
application
of
a
reasonable
doubt
standard
in
a
case
where
you
are
dealing,
although
it
is
an
appellate
court
that
deals
with
the
question,
with
questions
of
weight
of
the
evidence
because
in
a
harmless
error
context
and
what
the
court
is
concerned
with
is
a
relative
weight
of
this
bad
evidence
or
tainted
evidence
in
a
context
to
the
whole
evidence
to
determine
whether
it
harmed
the
petitioner.
it
is
essentially
a
question
again
of
weight
of
evidence.
there
is
no
precedent
and
i
submit
no
policy
consistent
with
the
existing
reasonable
doubt
rule.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes,
that
is
true.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well
i
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well
i
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes,
that
is
true,
except
i
would
suggest
that
in
particular,
the
griffin
versus
california
problem
dealt
with
in
chapman
is
at
base
away
of
the
evidence
problem
because
the
prosecution
is
using
silence
as
an
evidentiary
fact
that
is
saying
this
silence
helps
to
establish
our
case,
although
i
concede
that
--
i
admit
that
is
conceivable
that
there
would
be
cases
where
harmless
was
applied
that
you
could
not
say
that
that
the
error
in
question
dealt
specifically
with
evidence,
but
still
it
is
essential
in
the
resolution
of
that
problem,
usually
to
waive
the
evidence
as
a
whole
which
is
what
the
hamilton
versus
california
made
very
clear.
the
petitioner
does
not
dwell
extensively
on
its
first
proposition
that
all
questions
of
constitutional
acquisition
of
evidence
must
be
decided
by
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
he
does
take
it
as
a
second
position
that
there
is
something
in
a
special
nature
of
confessions
that
requires
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
i
would
point
out
an
initially
that
the
analysis
that
he
makes
is
essentially
incorrect.
i
do
not
think
one
can
say
that
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment
is
essentially
more
or
less
important
than
a
violation
of
the
fourth
and
the
sixth
amendments.
i
think
that
the
value
is
protected
by
the
fourth
and
sixth
are
fully
as
important
as
those
protected
by
the
fifth.
there
was
a
time
i
suppose
when
petitioner
might
say
with
some
justice
that
since
a
determination
of
voluntariness
of
a
confession
is
closely
tied
to
its
reliability
that
it
presented
the
different
issue.
i
do
not
think
that
contention
is
open
today.
i
do
not
think
it
is
been
open
since
rogers
versus
richmond
which
has
specifically
excluded
such
considerations
from
voluntariness.
there
is
some
language
in
older
cases
which
sought
to
rest
the
exclusion
of
involuntary
confession
on
pearce
as
to
the
reliability,
but
that
language
is
no
longer
good
law.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
think
that
rogers
and
richmond
dealt
with
the
determination
of
voluntariness.
i
do
not
think
a
probable
truth
or
falsity
is
banned
when
you
say
that
the
theory
you
want
to
consider
the
probable
truth
or
falsity
of
a
confession
in
light
or
the
weight
in
effect.
the
weight
of
this
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
am
saying
that
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
no
i
am
saying
that
probable
truth
and
falsity
is
excluded
from
determinations
of
voluntariness.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
the
jury
is
not
instructed
on
the
issue
of
voluntariness
at
all.
so
they
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes,
but
that
only
goes
to
its
weight.
the
weight
of
the
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes,
but
it
is
only
as
to
the
weight
of
the
confession.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
voluntariness.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
would
respectfully
disagree.
i
do
not
think
that
the
rogers
and
richmond
invalidated
instructions
to
the
jury
as
to
weight
of
the
confession.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
might
add
that
it
is
my
understanding
that
instructions
similar
to
those
given
in
illinois
are
given
in
federal
criminal
trials
with
respect
to
the
weight
of
the
confession.
i
point
out
in
addition
to
i
think
petitioner’s
erroneous
analysis
of
perhaps
attaching
excess
of
the
value
to
the
entries
protected
by
the
fifth
amendment
as
opposed
to
those
protected
by
the
fourth,
that
his
tactical
assertion
is
somehow
a
confession
is
more
significant
is
really
unjustified.
i
point
out
and
i
think
it
is
fairly
clear
that
in
any
given
case,
a
confession
may
be
of
relatively
minor
significance.
the
case
of
eleven
eyewitnesses
comes
to
mind.
the
case
in
which
illegal
wiretap
is
discovered,
has
recorded
evidence
of
the
crime
itself,
certain
seized
evidence,
a
large
quantity
of
heroin,
in
all
of
these
cases
and
sometimes
fingerprints,
a
confession
is
paled
into
insignificance,
and
particularly
the
nature
of
confession
is
and
to
some
extent
even
the
confession
in
this
case.
a
confessions
have
a
tendency
to
be
filled
with
self-serving
statements.
usually,
a
man
does
not
--
unlike
the
eyewitness
who
will
give
a
full
and
often
devastating
picture
of
the
crime,
the
confession
is
always
filled
with
or
often
filled
with
statements,
well,
i
did
this
but
i
did
not
mean
to,
i
did
not
want
to
hurt
the
victim
and
in
that
respect
it
is
difficult
to
say
certainly
not.
you
could
not
say
as
a
matter
of
law
confession
is
always
of
overwhelming
importance.
it
is
to
some
significance
to
me
at
least
that
the
principal
case
relied
on
by
the
petitioner
in
his
first
argument,
the
united
states
versus
schipani,
opinion
of
a
single
judge
at
district
court
in
which
the
court
said
that
there
ought
to
be
a
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
court
specifically
rejected
the
suggestion
that
a
difference
could
be
made
between
confessions
and
other
forms
of
evidence.
and
it
is
particularly
significant
because
it
is
difficult,
at
least
it
was
difficult
for
me
and
i
started
out
an
appellant
lawyer
and
before
i
started
to
try
criminal
cases.
it
is
difficult
when
one
sees
records
of
convictions
and
nothing
but
records
of
convictions,
to
make
assessments
as
to
what
evidence
really
ties
the
knot
with
a
particular
defendant.
and
it
is
significant
that
the
only
trial
court
opinion
that
the
petitioner
sights
specifically
rejects
any
distinction
between
confessions
and
other
points
to
that.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
that
is
schipani.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes,
at
least
i
was
familiar
with
that
before
i
read
the
opinion.
that
is
the
general
statistical
analysis.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
assuming
as
it
is
often
done
that
preponderance
to
the
evidence
equals
50
plus
and
reasonable
doubt
equals
95
plus.
i
do
not
know
that
i
would
accept
those
figures,
but
the
basic
mathematical
operation
is
correct.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
it
comes
out
to
50
minus.
it
would
come
out
to
50
minus.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
think
not
because
that
the
kind
of
shock
attitude
that
one
gets
toward
facing
a
criminal
judgment
on
the
50
minus
probability
is
essentially
a
shock
resulting
from
the
recurrence
of
convicting
an
innocent
man
and,
but
you
do
not
get
that
fact.
if
all
you
are
considering
is
convicting
an
innocent
man,
you
do
not
multiply
that
50
plus
and
you
still
left
for
the
original
95
plus.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
that
is
correct
and
i
might
say
that
his
opinion
is
--
it
follows
very
closely
an
analysis
of
similar
problems
by
two
columbia
professors,
jerome
michael
and
professor
waxton.
essentially
the
schipani
opinion
is
a
judicial
adoption
of
a
couple
of
law
reviews,
your
honor
and
it
has
not
been
much
adopted
in
this
country.
finally
and
this
is
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
i
have
written
a
couple
myself.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
and
i
would
generally
read
the
opinions
first
in
the
law
review
article.
the
third
point
made
by,
is
a
relatively
minor
one,
third
point
made
by
a
petitioner
i
think
i
ought
to
touch
on
it
is
that
the
defendant
in
this
case
is
in
a
much
worse
position
than
jackson
was
in
the
jackson
versus
denno.
i
have
a
two
essential
problems
with
that.
the
first
is
that
i
think
that
is
a
terrible
constitutional
standard
that
tactical
position
determines
whether
a
rule
is
constitutionally
required
and
to
put
it
another
way
i
think
that
a
petitioner
would
have
to
contend
that
jackson
and
denno
decided
that
whatever
makes
it
more
difficult
for
the
prosecution
to
put
--
present
a
confession
is
a
constitutionally
required.
my
second
difficulty
is
that
he
--
the
petitioner
here
is
not
worse
position
than
jackson.
plain
truth
of
the
matter
is
accepting
a
premise
of
the
jackson
opinion,
the
petitioner
in
jackson
never
had
a
hearing,
an
adequate
hearing
on
voluntariness
and
the
petitioner
here
did
have
such
a
hearing.
the
other
point
in
this
regard
made
by
the
petitioner
is
that
if
the
judge
makes
a
determination
that
a
confession
is
voluntary
by
preponderance
of
the
evidence
then
when
it
comes
to
the
time
of
trial,
the
confession
is
introduced
and
the
petitioner
has
to
determine
whether
to
get
up
on
the
stand
and
suffer
all
of
the
risks
connected
with
his
appearance
on
the
stand
and
he
must
do
this
without
a
proof
of
voluntariness
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
i
think
that
argument
cannot
be
sustained
in
light
of
mcgautha
versus
california
nor
can
it
be
sustained
in
light
of
the
guilty
plea
cases,
the
trilogy
of
cases
beginning
with
mcminn
versus
richmond.
and
in
fact
the
decision
whether
to
testify
is
made
by
a
defendant
without
any
determination
in
most
cases
of
important
issues
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
defendant
in
effect
can
take
a
prosecution
case
which
is
barely
able
to
survive
a
motion
for
directed
verdict,
testify
in
the
stand
and
sink
himself.
and
in
that
position,
far
worse
one
than
the
petitioner
faced
in
this
case,
that
he
has
no
right
to
determination
that
the
prosecution's
proof
establishes
his
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
final
point
made
by
petitioner
is
that
he
ought
to
have
been
given
a
jury
trial
in
effect
on
the
issue
of
voluntariness.
i
would
point
out
that
it
seems
to
me
that
the
essence
of
jackson
v.
denno
was
that
the
jury
does
not
really,
in
fact,
is
constitutionally
incapable
of
giving
a
hearing
on
the
issue
of
voluntariness.
that
the
jury
just
will
not
separate
the
issue,
that
jury
will
consider
weight
probable
truth
and
falsity
and
will
determine
voluntariness
in
the
pure
classic
sense.
i
point
out
also
that
the
jury
determination
of
issues
of
admissibility
is
not
a
traditional
function
of
the
jury
and
that
would
not
be
binding
upon
a
states
under
duncan
versus
louisiana
and
at
least
in
the
few
precedents
that
have
dealt
with
the
issue
seems
to
be
really
contended
that
there
is
a
constitutional
requirement
of
the
existing
precedent
such
as
that
it
is
against
that
contention.
frankly,
the
only
way
to
satisfy
petitioner’s
claim
in
this
regard
would
be
to
impanel
separate
jury
on
the
motion
to
suppress
because
it
would
be
only
then
purely
apart
from
the
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence
that
jury
could
give
a
determination
of
voluntariness.
it
is
our
opinion
and
our
contention
that
a
jury
ought
not
be
constitutional
required
to
decide
a
question
that
this
court
recognized
that
it
is
incapable
to
decide.
thank
you.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
i
first
ought
to
clarify
to
some
extent
the
illinois
procedure
with
respect
to
confessions,
probably
because
the
record
in
this
is
somewhat
a
typical.
under
illinois
law
the
initial
determination
of
voluntariness
is
made
by
the
trial
court.
by
statute
the
burden
of
proof
on
voluntariness
is
placed
on
the
prosecution.
the
statute
does
not
declare
what
that
burden
of
proof
is.
it
simply
states
that
the
prosecution
shall
prove
voluntariness.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
that
was
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes,
that
has
always
been
true.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
and
it
still
true.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
so
of
course
the
issue
is
to
whether
it
is
permissible
to
place
a
burden
on
the
defendant
is
not
really
before
the
court.
secondly,
ordinarily
in
the
criminal
case
the
issue
of
that
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
outside
the
presence.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
and
that
has
always
been
the
procedure
in
illinois.
the
illinois
follows
in
effect
the
orthodox
rule
and
has
done
so.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
no,
that
is
true.
there
was
a
pre-trial
motion
to
suppress
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury,
in
fact,
before
being
tendered
intent
these
issues,
they
are
usually
decided
along
before.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
before
the
jury
is
impaneled.
they
usually
decide
it
well
in
advance
of
trial.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes,
yes.
however
at
the
trial
itself,
a
confession
and
jury
specifically
directed
to
the
consideration
of
a
confession,
there
is
a
special
confession
instruction.
it
was
not
given
in
this
case
because
it
was
not
requested,
but
the
standard
procedure
under
illinois
is
for
the
jury
to
receive
an
instruction
telling
them
that
they
have
to
judge
the
way
that
the
confession
in
light
of
the
circumstances
that
it
is
making
and
in
some
detail.
now,
it
is
true
that
that
is
not
a
consideration
of
voluntariness.
the
jury
is
not
told
you
must
consider
whether
the
confession
is
voluntary.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
it
does
go
to
truth
and
falsity.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes.
that
is
the
standard
illinois
practice.
the
petitioner
in
attacking
that
practice
takes
basically
two
separate
positions.
his
first
is
that
in
any
case
where
the
constitutional
acquisition
or
constitutional
legality
of
the
acquisition
of
evidence
is
a
question,
it
is
the
burden
of
the
prosecution
to
prove
that
it
constitutionally
acquired
the
evidence
and
it
is
the
burden
that
they
must
sustain
by
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
now,
i
would
point
out
and
it
is
been
alluded
to
that
there
a
considerable
amount
of
precedent
generally
against
that
rule
on
search
and
seizure
cases.
the
federal
rule
does
not
place
the
burden
on
the
prosecution
in
cases
where
there
is
a
warrant.
there
are
many
states
that
place
the
burden
on
the
defense,
in
all
cases
where
illegality
of
search
and
seizures
challenged.
that
is
true
in
illinois
incidentally
by
statute,
a
statute
that
immediately
follows
the
one
on
confessions
deals
with
motion
to
suppress
evidence
illegally
seized.
i
might
also
point
out
that
in
the
few
cases
in
which
this
court
has
spoken
on
the
subject
of
burden
and
those
have
been
bumper
versus
north
carolina
on
the
burden
of
proof
to
establish
consent
search;
and
miranda
versus
arizona
on
the
burden
of
proof
to
establish
waiver;
and
in
united
states
versus
wade
on
the
burden
of
proof
to
establish
an
independent
basis
of
identification
when
there
is
a
primary
legality,
in
none
of
those
cases
has
this
court
adopted
a
reasonable
doubt
standard.
the
standard
is
simply
burden
of
proof
in
consent
cases.
in
miranda,
the
language
was
heavy
burden.
in
united
states
versus
wade,
the
language
was
clear
on
convincing
evidence.
essentially
its
petitioner’s
first
point
that
the
constitutional
nature
of
the
constitutional
issues
involved
make
these
questions
as
special.
i
would
point
out
that
only
if
you
take
a
very
limited
tactical
view
of
the
criminal
trial,
they
are
made
particularly
special.
questions
of
the
admissibility
of
hearsay
are
usually
of
extreme
importance
in
criminal
trial.
i
point
out
that,
for
example,
it
s
not
the
burden
of
the
prosecution
to
prove
that
conspiracy
exists
and
to
prove
it
exists
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
before
the
declaration
of
the
co-conspirator
can
be
admitted
into
evidence.
and
the
question
of
accomplices
which
is
a
vital
question
in
most
criminal
trials
where
there
is
accomplice
evidence,
it
is
the
burden
of
the
defendant
to
prove
witness
is
an
accomplice
and
that
is
particularly
vital
burden
since
that
very
often
is
the
difference
between
a
directed
verdict
of
acquittal
and
a
conviction
on
the
other
hand.
furthermore,
i
think
that
there
is
a
confusion
and
it
runs
through
all
of
the
arguments
of
the
petitioner,
between
the
purpose
served
as
a
reasonable
doubt
rule
and
the
purpose
served
by
the
exclusionary
rules.
it
is
clear
to
me
at
least
that
the
purposes
of
the
exclusionary
rule
are
in
entirely
separate
and
apart
from
the
determination
of
guilt
or
innocence.
indeed
with
some
of
the
exclusionary
rules,
mostly
search
and
seizure,
their
existence
cannot
be
squared
with
policies
promoting
the
accuracy
of
fact-finding.
furthermore,
the
reasonable
doubt
rule,
in
all
of
its
manifestations,
every
single
one
is
a
rule
that
is
concerned
solely
with
the
weight
of
the
evidence
in
a
criminal
trial
and
not
with
the
admissibility
of
evidence
and
chapman
upon
which
petitioner
relies
very
heavily
does
not
change
this.
first
of
all
chapman
is
a
case
that
applies
only
when
the
existence
of
a
constitutional
error
has
been
established
and
it
says
nothing
about
the
burden
of
proof
to
establish
the
existence
of
that
error.
second
of
all,
chapman
is
essentially
an
application
of
a
reasonable
doubt
standard
in
a
case
where
you
are
dealing,
although
it
is
an
appellate
court
that
deals
with
the
question,
with
questions
of
weight
of
the
evidence
because
in
a
harmless
error
context
and
what
the
court
is
concerned
with
is
a
relative
weight
of
this
bad
evidence
or
tainted
evidence
in
a
context
to
the
whole
evidence
to
determine
whether
it
harmed
the
petitioner.
it
is
essentially
a
question
again
of
weight
of
evidence.
there
is
no
precedent
and
i
submit
no
policy
consistent
with
the
existing
reasonable
doubt
rule.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes,
that
is
true.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well
i
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well
i
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes,
that
is
true,
except
i
would
suggest
that
in
particular,
the
griffin
versus
california
problem
dealt
with
in
chapman
is
at
base
away
of
the
evidence
problem
because
the
prosecution
is
using
silence
as
an
evidentiary
fact
that
is
saying
this
silence
helps
to
establish
our
case,
although
i
concede
that
--
i
admit
that
is
conceivable
that
there
would
be
cases
where
harmless
was
applied
that
you
could
not
say
that
that
the
error
in
question
dealt
specifically
with
evidence,
but
still
it
is
essential
in
the
resolution
of
that
problem,
usually
to
waive
the
evidence
as
a
whole
which
is
what
the
hamilton
versus
california
made
very
clear.
the
petitioner
does
not
dwell
extensively
on
its
first
proposition
that
all
questions
of
constitutional
acquisition
of
evidence
must
be
decided
by
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
he
does
take
it
as
a
second
position
that
there
is
something
in
a
special
nature
of
confessions
that
requires
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
i
would
point
out
an
initially
that
the
analysis
that
he
makes
is
essentially
incorrect.
i
do
not
think
one
can
say
that
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment
is
essentially
more
or
less
important
than
a
violation
of
the
fourth
and
the
sixth
amendments.
i
think
that
the
value
is
protected
by
the
fourth
and
sixth
are
fully
as
important
as
those
protected
by
the
fifth.
there
was
a
time
i
suppose
when
petitioner
might
say
with
some
justice
that
since
a
determination
of
voluntariness
of
a
confession
is
closely
tied
to
its
reliability
that
it
presented
the
different
issue.
i
do
not
think
that
contention
is
open
today.
i
do
not
think
it
is
been
open
since
rogers
versus
richmond
which
has
specifically
excluded
such
considerations
from
voluntariness.
there
is
some
language
in
older
cases
which
sought
to
rest
the
exclusion
of
involuntary
confession
on
pearce
as
to
the
reliability,
but
that
language
is
no
longer
good
law.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
think
that
rogers
and
richmond
dealt
with
the
determination
of
voluntariness.
i
do
not
think
a
probable
truth
or
falsity
is
banned
when
you
say
that
the
theory
you
want
to
consider
the
probable
truth
or
falsity
of
a
confession
in
light
or
the
weight
in
effect.
the
weight
of
this
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
am
saying
that
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
no
i
am
saying
that
probable
truth
and
falsity
is
excluded
from
determinations
of
voluntariness.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
the
jury
is
not
instructed
on
the
issue
of
voluntariness
at
all.
so
they
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes,
but
that
only
goes
to
its
weight.
the
weight
of
the
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes,
but
it
is
only
as
to
the
weight
of
the
confession.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
voluntariness.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
would
respectfully
disagree.
i
do
not
think
that
the
rogers
and
richmond
invalidated
instructions
to
the
jury
as
to
weight
of
the
confession.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
might
add
that
it
is
my
understanding
that
instructions
similar
to
those
given
in
illinois
are
given
in
federal
criminal
trials
with
respect
to
the
weight
of
the
confession.
i
point
out
in
addition
to
i
think
petitioner’s
erroneous
analysis
of
perhaps
attaching
excess
of
the
value
to
the
entries
protected
by
the
fifth
amendment
as
opposed
to
those
protected
by
the
fourth,
that
his
tactical
assertion
is
somehow
a
confession
is
more
significant
is
really
unjustified.
i
point
out
and
i
think
it
is
fairly
clear
that
in
any
given
case,
a
confession
may
be
of
relatively
minor
significance.
the
case
of
eleven
eyewitnesses
comes
to
mind.
the
case
in
which
illegal
wiretap
is
discovered,
has
recorded
evidence
of
the
crime
itself,
certain
seized
evidence,
a
large
quantity
of
heroin,
in
all
of
these
cases
and
sometimes
fingerprints,
a
confession
is
paled
into
insignificance,
and
particularly
the
nature
of
confession
is
and
to
some
extent
even
the
confession
in
this
case.
a
confessions
have
a
tendency
to
be
filled
with
self-serving
statements.
usually,
a
man
does
not
--
unlike
the
eyewitness
who
will
give
a
full
and
often
devastating
picture
of
the
crime,
the
confession
is
always
filled
with
or
often
filled
with
statements,
well,
i
did
this
but
i
did
not
mean
to,
i
did
not
want
to
hurt
the
victim
and
in
that
respect
it
is
difficult
to
say
certainly
not.
you
could
not
say
as
a
matter
of
law
confession
is
always
of
overwhelming
importance.
it
is
to
some
significance
to
me
at
least
that
the
principal
case
relied
on
by
the
petitioner
in
his
first
argument,
the
united
states
versus
schipani,
opinion
of
a
single
judge
at
district
court
in
which
the
court
said
that
there
ought
to
be
a
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
court
specifically
rejected
the
suggestion
that
a
difference
could
be
made
between
confessions
and
other
forms
of
evidence.
and
it
is
particularly
significant
because
it
is
difficult,
at
least
it
was
difficult
for
me
and
i
started
out
an
appellant
lawyer
and
before
i
started
to
try
criminal
cases.
it
is
difficult
when
one
sees
records
of
convictions
and
nothing
but
records
of
convictions,
to
make
assessments
as
to
what
evidence
really
ties
the
knot
with
a
particular
defendant.
and
it
is
significant
that
the
only
trial
court
opinion
that
the
petitioner
sights
specifically
rejects
any
distinction
between
confessions
and
other
points
to
that.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
that
is
schipani.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes,
at
least
i
was
familiar
with
that
before
i
read
the
opinion.
that
is
the
general
statistical
analysis.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
assuming
as
it
is
often
done
that
preponderance
to
the
evidence
equals
50
plus
and
reasonable
doubt
equals
95
plus.
i
do
not
know
that
i
would
accept
those
figures,
but
the
basic
mathematical
operation
is
correct.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
it
comes
out
to
50
minus.
it
would
come
out
to
50
minus.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
think
not
because
that
the
kind
of
shock
attitude
that
one
gets
toward
facing
a
criminal
judgment
on
the
50
minus
probability
is
essentially
a
shock
resulting
from
the
recurrence
of
convicting
an
innocent
man
and,
but
you
do
not
get
that
fact.
if
all
you
are
considering
is
convicting
an
innocent
man,
you
do
not
multiply
that
50
plus
and
you
still
left
for
the
original
95
plus.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
that
is
correct
and
i
might
say
that
his
opinion
is
--
it
follows
very
closely
an
analysis
of
similar
problems
by
two
columbia
professors,
jerome
michael
and
professor
waxton.
essentially
the
schipani
opinion
is
a
judicial
adoption
of
a
couple
of
law
reviews,
your
honor
and
it
has
not
been
much
adopted
in
this
country.
finally
and
this
is
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
i
have
written
a
couple
myself.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
and
i
would
generally
read
the
opinions
first
in
the
law
review
article.
the
third
point
made
by,
is
a
relatively
minor
one,
third
point
made
by
a
petitioner
i
think
i
ought
to
touch
on
it
is
that
the
defendant
in
this
case
is
in
a
much
worse
position
than
jackson
was
in
the
jackson
versus
denno.
i
have
a
two
essential
problems
with
that.
the
first
is
that
i
think
that
is
a
terrible
constitutional
standard
that
tactical
position
determines
whether
a
rule
is
constitutionally
required
and
to
put
it
another
way
i
think
that
a
petitioner
would
have
to
contend
that
jackson
and
denno
decided
that
whatever
makes
it
more
difficult
for
the
prosecution
to
put
--
present
a
confession
is
a
constitutionally
required.
my
second
difficulty
is
that
he
--
the
petitioner
here
is
not
worse
position
than
jackson.
plain
truth
of
the
matter
is
accepting
a
premise
of
the
jackson
opinion,
the
petitioner
in
jackson
never
had
a
hearing,
an
adequate
hearing
on
voluntariness
and
the
petitioner
here
did
have
such
a
hearing.
the
other
point
in
this
regard
made
by
the
petitioner
is
that
if
the
judge
makes
a
determination
that
a
confession
is
voluntary
by
preponderance
of
the
evidence
then
when
it
comes
to
the
time
of
trial,
the
confession
is
introduced
and
the
petitioner
has
to
determine
whether
to
get
up
on
the
stand
and
suffer
all
of
the
risks
connected
with
his
appearance
on
the
stand
and
he
must
do
this
without
a
proof
of
voluntariness
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
i
think
that
argument
cannot
be
sustained
in
light
of
mcgautha
versus
california
nor
can
it
be
sustained
in
light
of
the
guilty
plea
cases,
the
trilogy
of
cases
beginning
with
mcminn
versus
richmond.
and
in
fact
the
decision
whether
to
testify
is
made
by
a
defendant
without
any
determination
in
most
cases
of
important
issues
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
defendant
in
effect
can
take
a
prosecution
case
which
is
barely
able
to
survive
a
motion
for
directed
verdict,
testify
in
the
stand
and
sink
himself.
and
in
that
position,
far
worse
one
than
the
petitioner
faced
in
this
case,
that
he
has
no
right
to
determination
that
the
prosecution's
proof
establishes
his
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
final
point
made
by
petitioner
is
that
he
ought
to
have
been
given
a
jury
trial
in
effect
on
the
issue
of
voluntariness.
i
would
point
out
that
it
seems
to
me
that
the
essence
of
jackson
v.
denno
was
that
the
jury
does
not
really,
in
fact,
is
constitutionally
incapable
of
giving
a
hearing
on
the
issue
of
voluntariness.
that
the
jury
just
will
not
separate
the
issue,
that
jury
will
consider
weight
probable
truth
and
falsity
and
will
determine
voluntariness
in
the
pure
classic
sense.
i
point
out
also
that
the
jury
determination
of
issues
of
admissibility
is
not
a
traditional
function
of
the
jury
and
that
would
not
be
binding
upon
a
states
under
duncan
versus
louisiana
and
at
least
in
the
few
precedents
that
have
dealt
with
the
issue
seems
to
be
really
contended
that
there
is
a
constitutional
requirement
of
the
existing
precedent
such
as
that
it
is
against
that
contention.
frankly,
the
only
way
to
satisfy
petitioner’s
claim
in
this
regard
would
be
to
impanel
separate
jury
on
the
motion
to
suppress
because
it
would
be
only
then
purely
apart
from
the
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence
that
jury
could
give
a
determination
of
voluntariness.
it
is
our
opinion
and
our
contention
that
a
jury
ought
not
be
constitutional
required
to
decide
a
question
that
this
court
recognized
that
it
is
incapable
to
decide.
thank
you.
