mr.
pat
bailey
yes.
mr.
pat
bailey
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
say
initially
for
rebuttal.
i
will
comment
one
statement
made
in
one
of
the
briefs
filed
by
the
appellees.
statement
says,
texas
you
finance
your
great
university,
your
school,
your
tremendous
highway
system,
why
do
you
fight
the
financing
of
the
most
essential
duty
of
government,
when
you
know
that,
the
primary
elections
in
the
most
part
are
tantamount
to
election.
i
think
that
this
is
one
of
the
issues
that
comes
up
in
this
case
because
what
in
affect
the
trial
court,
the
three-judge
court
below
has
done,
is
to
completely
do
away
with
the
financing
system
in
texas
that
we
have
for
all
of
our
election
process
with
the
exception
of
the
general
election.
they
have
an
effect
said,
texas
can
raise
a
revenue
or
can
take
care
of
it
in
some
source.
but
really
what
in
effect
the
court
has
done,
is
say
that
the
state
of
texas
are
some
lesser
political
sub-division
of
the
state,
well
now,
i
have
to
take
over
this
function
that
the
political
parties
that
wish
to
submit
nominees
for
election
on
the
general
ballot
are
now
doing,
is
in
fact
forcing
the
state
to
extend
moneys,
to
allocate
their
limited
tax
funds
or
the
local
tax
and
bodies
limited
to
another
project
which
i
think
as
you
can
see
by
the
statements
to
pay
are
rather
expensive
at
times.
now,
this
case
really
started
out.
i
think
we
kind
of
--
it
is
kind
of
moved
around
and
jumbled
around
a
little
bit
to
work
really
hard
to
see
what
we
really
have.
it
really
started
out
with
some
particular
candidates
who
did
not
have,
but
they
have
got
adequate
funds
to
pay
the
filing
fees,
challenging
the
heights
of
these.
during
the
course
of
this
case,
certain
voters
intervened
that
said
that
i
would
like
to
vote
for
a
particular
one
of
these
candidates
and
actually
what
the
court
finally
decided
this
case
on
was
not
the
rights
of
the
candidates
here,
is
to
whether
or
not,
they
had
a
right
to
be
on
about
without
paying
some
sort
of
filing
fee.
what
they
said
is
that
you
have
infringed
upon
some
voting
right
of
the
voters.
now,
i
think
what
you
did
here
is,
that
when
we
start
talking
about
the
voting
right
principles,
we
start
talking
about
compelling
interest
and
this
is
again
the
court
said
that
there
is
no
compelling
interest
for
the
state
to
have
allowed
this
type
of
situation
in
this
particular
case.
well,
i
submit
in
this
connection
that
possibly
the
court
has
used
the
wrong
path
in
this
case,
they
have
used
one
of
this
voting
principle
cases,
to
decide
whether
these
fees,
was
there
any
compelling
answers
to
the
state
for
these
filing
fees.
mr.
pat
bailey
they
do
not,
your
honor.
mr.
pat
bailey
i
think
that
your
honor,
you
would
have
a
bigger
problem,
or
would
have
one.
if
you
just
made
a
charge
and
i
think
this
maybe
is
tied
in
with
what
the
court
below
said.
they
said
that
having
a
filing-fee
to
pay
--
mr.
pat
bailey
i
do
not
know
your
honor
that
i
think
--
well,
i
will
go
back
to
this.
i
think
it
possibly,
maybe
it
would.
i
think
that
one
that
was
based
on
cost
of
the
election
process
would
certainly
be
in
a
better
situation
than
one
as
the
court
below
mentioned.
they
said
a
small
or
reasonable,
they
talked
about
a
reasonable
type
of
filing
fee.
as
if
some
lower
filing
fee
would
be
constitutionally
acceptable.
they
said
it
would
be
permissible.
it
would
be
illegitimate
possibly
even
compelling
function
of
the
state.
but
i
think
what
happens
here
is
--
mr.
pat
bailey
i
think
that
if
you
put
some
type
of
filing
fee
on
the,
the
ultimate
general,
on
the
general
election.
mr.
pat
bailey
i
think
you
might
have
some
constitutional
questions
there
your
honor
but
i
think
that
--
mr.
pat
bailey
no
your
honor.
mr.
pat
bailey
yes
sir,
but
in
another
part
of
this
intrical
machinery
is
a
fact
that
a
candidate,
if
he
wants
to
be
only
ballot,
the
general
election,
there
is
a
process
for
getting
only,
will
not
cost
him
this
filing
fee.
i
granted,
it
is
not
a
--
mr.
pat
bailey
no
sir,
it
will
not.
mr.
pat
bailey
i
presume,
it
would
cost
him
this
and
possibly
the
stamp
or
some
of
the
other
expenses
in
this
nature
your
honor.
but
i
think
that
when
we
start
talking,
as
the
court
below,
they
added
some
other
type
fee
other
than
this
high
one
would
be
acceptable.
to
me,
this
is
incorrect,
because
i
think
is
what
more
compelling
are
reasonable
reason
could
the
state
have
and
to
say
we
are
going
to
set
these
filing
fees
to
where
they
will
cover
the
cost
of
the
election.
i
think
that
to
say
it
could
be
some
other
lower
fee
that
had
no
basis
of
this
nature
then
it
would
not
be
possibly
either
reasonable
or
compelling.
mr.
pat
bailey
i
am
not
sure
which
one
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
pat
bailey
i
do
not
know
at
the
moment
i
think
that
we
will
just
put
it
in
so
the
court
could
see
what
had
been
done
in
connection
with
the
situation
that
the
trial
court
had
or
the
court
below
had
put
us
into
that
the
legislature
had
to
take
certain
action
and
this
was
--
mr.
pat
bailey
well,
i
think
your
honor
--
mr.
pat
bailey
yes
sir.
mr.
pat
bailey
i
think
in
a
--
mr.
pat
bailey
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
nothing
more
than
to
show
what
the
legislature
had
done
because
i
think
we
are
in
this
area
of
filing
fees
in
the
election
process,
for
the
court
to
know
what
we
are
trying
to
do.
i
think
sometimes
we
do
not
know
what
guidelines
to
do
and
if
we
are
wrong
in
something
and
it
does
give
the
court
opportunity
to
possibly
see
the
way
we
are
handling
it,
the
way
the
legislature
is
possibly
going
to
handle
it
to
where,
if
we
are
incorrect
that
the
legislature
will
know
what
next
time
possibly
to
do
to
correct
any
of
these
things,
and
this
is
my
only
explanation
for
this.
mr.
pat
bailey
yes.
mr.
pat
bailey
no,
the
primaries
will
be
coming
up
this
spring
and
then
the
general
election
--
mr.
pat
bailey
this
is
correct.
but
we
submit
that
the
payment
of
we
think
that,
what
we
have
got
here
in
this
particular
case
is
that
there
are
several
methods
that
a
person
can
reach
of
the
office.
they
can
do
it
under
a
banner
of
a
particular
political
party,
they
can
run
in
the
general
election
on
a
write-in,
i
mean
by
getting
on
the
ballot
in
the
manner
provided
at
the
general
election.
i
think
that
the
court
below
said
that
some
right
of
the
voter
had
been
infringed
upon
here.
actually,
what
the
court
has
said
that
a
voter
has
a
right
to
vote
for
a
particular
candidate.
and
if
the
state
by
its
statutes
and
regulating
the
election
process
does
anything
to
keep
a
particular
voter
from
voting
for
a
particular
candidate
of
his
choice.
if
anything
keeps
him
off
the
ballot,
be
it
the
filing
fee
or
some
other
problem
of
having
to
do
something,
keeps
him
off
the
ballot.
then,
it
is
constitutionally
bad.
we
think
that
what
has
been
done
here
is
actually,
the
burden
has
not
been
put
on
the
voter,
by
the
law
the
way
it
is,
it
has
been
put
there
now
because
ultimately,
by
this
statute
being
held
invalid,
the
tax
payer
who
is
also
the
voter
is
going
to
now
have
to
pick
up
the
path
for
these
elections
rather
than
the
camp.
thank
you.
mr.
pat
bailey
yes.
mr.
pat
bailey
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to

on
the
voter,
by
the
law
the
way
it
is,
it
has
been
put
there
now
because
ultimately,
by
this
statute
being
held
invalid,
the
tax
payer
who
is
also
the
voter
is
going
to
now
have
to
pick
up
the
path
for
these
elections
rather
than
the
camp.
thank
you.
