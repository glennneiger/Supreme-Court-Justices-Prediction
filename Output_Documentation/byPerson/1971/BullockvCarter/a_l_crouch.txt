mr.
a.
l.
crouch
yes.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
background
of
the
filling
fee
is
that
it
was
designed
along
with
the
poll
tax
to
exclude
blacks
from
the
party
primaries
in
texas.
the
poll
tax
was
adopted
into
the
state
constitution
in
1902,
and
the
filling
fee
was
adopted
by
the
legislature
in
1911.
in
united
states
versus
texas,
judge
thornberry
said
that
one
of
the
main
purposes
of
the
poll
tax
was
to
disenfranchise
the
negro
voter,
and
we
maintain
that
the
purpose
of
the
filling
fee
was
to
finance
these
five
primaries,
which
have
been
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
five
different
times.
now,
the
very
fact
that
words
indicating
race
are
not
mentioned
in
the
statute
does
not
mean
that
race
can
not
be
a
picture
because
the
very
act
of
adopting
an
economic
status
standard
for
a
person
who
seeks
elective
office
is
automatically
placing
a
race
standard
in
effect.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
no
your
honor.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
i
pointed
out
in
my
brief
that
the
filling
fees
stand
to
keep
indigents
from
filling.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
yes.
but
it
also
--
when
you
talk
about
indigents,
you
are
talking
more
about
minority
parties
than
you
are
whites,
and
you
are
talking
more
about
women
than
you
are
men.
i
have
some
tables
in
my
brief
to
illustrate
that.
now,
in
texas
in
addition
to
the
blacks,
we
have
the
browns,
and
mr.
morehead
pointed
out
that
it
is
fairly
easy
to
get
on
the
election
ballot
in
the
general
election
as
a
write-in
candidate.
well,
in
the
brief
filed
from
el
paso,
there
is
a
table
over
in
the
back
showing
write-in
candidates
in
the
november
1970,
general
election,
the
last
page
86,
and
there
were
398
write-in
votes.
so
that
is
an
exercise
in
futility
to
attempt
to
get
on
the
general
election
ballot
as
a
write-in
candidate.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
this
is
a
third
party,
and
a
group
attempted
that
last
year
called
latassa
univa
(ph)
and
the
supreme
court
of
texas
turned
them
down
over
technicality.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
yes.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
no.
they
apparently
had
enough
percentages
in
at
least
one
or
two
counties.
they
were
trying
to
get
on
in
five
counties
as
i
remember
correctly.
there
was
a
dissenting
opinion
which
indicated
that
this
group
was
acting
in
good
faith,
but
they
had
the
conflicting
opinions
of
what
statute
meant
from
two
to
three
different
state
officials,
and
nobody
understood
what
the
statute
was
and
so
they
were
not
allowed
on
the
ballot.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
right,
in
the
third
party
column,
alright.
now
bringing
that
down
to
county
level,
he
mentioned
the
figure
500
signatures
as
a
maximum,
that
is
true.
but
since,
this
case
has
been
decided,
the
legislature
of
texas
has
done
a
remarkable
plastic
surgery
job
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
they
have
enacted
what
is
called
house
bill
five
and
i
am
not
sure
when
the
bandages
come
off,
but
i
think
january
the
1st.
now,
in
that
particular
house
bill
five,
the
requirement
to
get
on
as
a
write-in
candidate
is
10%
of
the
people
who
voted
for
governor
in
your
party
at
the
last
general
election,
which
in
tarrant
county
would
be
6,211
signatures
and
they
have
to
be
sworn
too
before
a
notary,
and
the
notary
in
texas
is
entitled
to
a
$0.50
statutory
fee
which
would
mean
over
$3,000
just
a
notary
fees
to
get
the
signatures.
now
that
is
not
$500
which
is
all
that
requires
to
get
on
as
a
third
party
candidate.
but
over
6000
to
get
into
the
democratic
primary
as
a
write-in
candidate,
and
in
addition
to
that,
you
have
to
sign
and
swear
to
your
popazao
and
humiliate
and
degrade
yourself
by
helping
to
establish
and
perpetuate
a
cash
system.
i
do
not
see
any
need
for
that,
but
there
it
is.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
yes.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
yes,
the
test
does
not
exhibit
in
the
state’s
brief.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
yes.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
now,
it
is
also
a
temporary
measure
that
expires
at
the
end
of
1972,
so
nobody
really
knows
what
it
means.
now,
with
the
reference
to
mr.
morehead’s
statement
about
two
sets
of
voting
officials,
the
secretary
of
state
himself
who
is
a
chief
election
officer
for
the
state
of
texas
has
recommended
in
a
message
to
the
last
legislature
that
a
unitary
primary
system
be
established
and
that
it
be
paid
for
out
of
tax
bonds
by
the
county
and
by
the
state
and
so
we
would
eliminate
some
of
the
cost
of
having
the
duplicating
primaries,
if
that
recommendation
is
followed.
now,
i
maintain
and
i
have
all
throughout
that
the
filling
fee
is
a
poll
tax
imposed
on
a
citizen
who
wants
to
run
for
office
and
vote
for
himself.
now
in
texas,
you
have
what
is
called
a
cost
deposit
of
$50
for
a
person
who
wants
to
run
for
county
office.
he
pays
that
at
the
same
time
that
he
files
his
application
to
run.
then,
after
the
executive
committee
has
had
a
chance
to
meet
and
make
the
party
assessments,
at
that
time,
he
has
to
add
up
additional
sums
of
money
running
up
in
several
thousand
dollars.
this
last
year
in
tarrant
county,
the
filling
fee
assessed
by
the
executive
committee
of
the
party
was
32%
of
the
annual
salary
which
is
a
very
large
sum
of
money,
and
as
mr.
morehead
pointed
out,
of
the
25
tarrant
county
officials
on
the
primary
ballot
in
the
democratic
primary
last
year,
only
two
of
them
had
opponents
because
of
these
high
filling
fees.
and
of
the
total
of
over
$200,000
received
by
the
chairman
of
tarrant
county
democratic
party
in
1970,
77%
of
that
money
came
from
the
incomes
themselves.
there
was
nobody
else
who
could
afford
to
pay
and
it
is
outside
of
the
record
but
of
course,
many
of
them
found
difficulty
in
paying
it
to.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
i
think
not,
i
think
they
are
unconstitutional
to
everybody,
even
as
the
poll
tax
is
unconstitutional
to
everybody,
and
with
reference
to
the
poll
tax
once
more,
i
would
like
to
remind
the
court
of
harman
versus
forssenius
in
that
case
it
was
the
virginia
case,
the
twenty-fourth
amendment
had
been
adopted
outlawing
the
poll
tax
in
federal
elections,
in
the
state
of
virginia
to
get
around
this
ruling
fairly
passed
a
statute
that
made
it
possible
for
anybody
who
wanted
to
avoid
the
payment
of
poll
tax
to
file
an
affidavit
instead,
and
the
affidavit
testified
that
the
person
had
been
a
resident
for
so
many
months
and
that
he
intended
to
remain
a
resident
throughout
until
the
election
was
over.
but
you
see
in
our
case,
we
have
harman
versus
forssenius
all
over
again
except
instead
of
one
affidavit
we
have
to
file
6,100
affidavits
and
i
think
that
6,100
times
is
as
bad
as
harman
versus
forssenius
of
course,
prejudice
did
not
matter.
of
course
i
have
represented
these
people
who
just
flat
have
not
been
able
to
pay
the
filling
fees
that
have
been
demanded.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
that
is
right!
and
it
was
so
stipulated
by
the
other
side.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
there
were
three
different
plaintiffs
in
the
case.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
right.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
that
is
right.
two
of
them
were
lawsuits
incidentally.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
no
sir,
it
is
applied
to
all.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
that
is
my
understanding.
yes.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
well,
there
is
the
question
of
the
low
and
narrow
fee,
there
is
some
sort
of
hesitation
on
the
part
of
judge
thornberry,
if
i
remember
correctly
and
he
was
concern
about
wetherington
case
over
in
florida,
which
held
that
reasonable
filling
fees
maybe
constitutional.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
and
i
think
he
was
trying
to
take
that
really
into
account
when
he
said
possibly
a
low
and
narrow
fee
might
be
constitutional,
he
did
not
say
it
was.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
sir
he
wrote
conquering
opinion.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
no
sir
and
the
court
asked
a
while
ago
about
was
there
any
first
amendment
case
other
than
ours
and
the
duncantell
case
which
was
decided
in
houston
on
october
the
27th,
specifically
says
that
the
right
to
run
for
elective
office
is
inextricably
woven
into
the
fabric
of
the
first
amendment
and
one
of
my
co-counsel
here
has
pointed
out
to
me
that
williams
v.
rhodes
also
was
decided
on
the
basis
of
the
first
amendment.
but
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
first
amendment
is
much
more
important
in
this
particular
part.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
right.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
well,
the
right
to
associate
is
a
part
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
yes
sir.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
yes
sir.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
that
is
right,
the
whole
state
of
texas
and
the
political
parties
are
all
enjoined.
now
with
reference
to
the
standard
to
be
employed,
as
i
understand
it,
there
are
three
different
standards
that
can
be
employed,
the
first
is
whether
or
not
the
articulated
state
goal
can
be
accomplished
in
some
less
drastic
means
than
the
one
employed
by
the
state.
and
under
crammer,
that
question
needs
to
be
answered
first
before
you
go
into
the
question
of
whether
you
apply
the
compelling
justification
test
or
the
rational
interest
test.
and
i
take
the
position
that
there
is
another
less
drastic
way
of
regulating
the
ballot
in
nominating
petitions
and
there
are
34
offices
included
on
the
tarrant
county
ballot
in
1970
which
is
given
in
one
of
the
exhibits
in
my
brief
and
21
of
those
offices
could
come
off
the
ballot
if
we
have
legislation
permitting
single
member
legislative
districts
and
single
member
judicial
districts
for
tarrant
county.
that
trouble
with
the
nominating
petition
i
think
would
be
a
less
drastic
means
than
a
filling
fee
to
regulate
the
ballot.
but
coming
back
to
harper,
harper
plainly
says
that
any
fee
is
per
se
unconstitutional
because
it
is
irrelevant,
the
man's
economic
status
has
no
relevancy
whatsoever
to
his
qualifications
as
a
voter
and
mr.
morehead
pointed
out
the
case
from
georgia,
the
turner
versus
fouche
case,
he
mistakenly
said
that
that
involved
a
filling
fee
when
actually
it
did
not,
it
required
an
ownership
of
real
property.
but
i
think
that
the
ownership
of
real
property
is
equivalent
to
the
ownership
of
personal
property
except
in
texas,
the
state
takes
the
personal
property
and
the
state
of
georgia
allows
the
man
to
keep
his
one
square
inch
of
real
property.
shelton
versus
tucker,
the
breadth
of
legislative
abridgment
must
be
reviewed
in
the
light
of
less
drastic
means
for
achieving
the
same
basic
purpose.
williams
versus
illinois,
mr.
justice
harlan
in
a
separate
opinion
conquering
the
matrix
of
recent
equal
protection
analysis
is
that
the
rule
of
statutory
classifications
which
either
are
based
upon
certain
suspect
criteria
or
affect
fundamental
right
will
be
held
to
the
equal
protection
unless
justified
by
a
compelling
government
entries
citing
sheparo,
harper
and
williams
and
in
this
case,
we
not
only
have
the
fundamental
constitutional
right
to
run
for
elective
office,
but
it
is
concomitant,
the
fundamental
constitutional
right
to
vote
for
the
candidate
who
wants
to
run
and
in
addition
to
those
two
fundamental
constitutional
rights
which
were
involved,
we
have
also
this
suspect
legislative
criterion
of
poverty.
we
have
the
filling
fee
limits
the
place
on
the
ballot
to
the
man
with
money
and
this
means
that
his
economic
status
has
become
a
qualification
for
office
and
all
of
the
three
offices
involved
here
are
offices
for
the
qualifications
are
set
by
the
constitution
of
the
state,
and
it
is
beyond
the
power
of
the
state
legislature
to
amend
the
constitution
of
the
state
and
pass
additional
requirements.
and
economic
status
is
absolutely
irrelevant,
the
edward’s
case
held
this.
recently
the
graham
case
has
held
it,
and
in
the
graham
case,
as
fas
as
i
remember
the
case
correctly,
there
was
a
case
involving
aliens
and
the
court
said
that
an
alien
had
this
right,
regardless
of
his
nationality
to
welfare
benefits
and
it
was
very
important
that
he
should
have
it
and
in
our
case,
we
are
not
representing
aliens,
we
are
representing
american
citizens
and
american
citizens
who
are
not
asking
for
a
handout,
they
are
not
asking
to
go
on
the
welfare
roles.
they
do
not
have
any
money
but
they
are
asking
for
a
job.
they
are
asking
for
a
right
to
be
considered
for
elective
office,
which
under
turner
versus
fouche,
i
think
they
have
a
basic
fundamental
right
to
be
considered
for
elective
office
without
these
other
qualifications,
which
are
absolutely
unconstitutional.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
that
is
right.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
no
sir,
the
opinion
there
says
that
the
political
parties
plural
of
the
state
are
enjoined,
but
let
me
point
that
in
my
candidate’s
particular
race,
there
were
no
republican
candidates
stalled.
if
i
remember
correctly,
there
were
only
the
candidates
in
tarrant
county,
texas
only
filled
candidates
in
four
races,
four
county
races
out
of
30
somewhat.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
that
is
right.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
well,
they
hold
on
if
a
party
get
a
certain
number
of
votes
in
the
november
election,
they
have
to
hold
a
primary.
but
the
republican
party
is
not
able
to
collect
these
filling
fees
because
their
nomination
really
is
not
worth
in
all
full
lot
and
they
have
to
use
volunteers
help
at
the
post,
whereas
the
workers
in
the
democratic
primaries
are
paid
$2
an
hour
out
of
the
filling
fees.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
yes,
they
have
fees
but
quite
frequently,
they
return
the
fees
and
do
not
use
them.
but
mostly,
they
try
to
use
volunteer
help
and
quite
frequently,
they
do
not
use
the
voting
machine
because
the
paper
ballots
are
cheaper.
there
is
a
newspaper
clipping
from
the
dallas
morning
news
in
el
paso
brief
which
i
would
like
to
refer
the
court
to
explaining
the
problems
with
reference
to
republican
party.
but
if
the
secretary
of
state's
recommendation
--
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
pardon?
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
well,
no
this
was
statewide
race.
the
republicans
are
able
to
win
statewide
--
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
except
in
statewide
races.
but
if
the
filing
fees
go
out
and
the
recommendations
of
the
secretary
of
state
are
followed
by
the
legislature
and
we
have
a
unitary
primary,
then
we
will
have
greater
participation
on
part
of
all,
because
everybody
will
go
to
the
same
place
to
vote
just
as
in
november.
the
republicans
will
go
to
this
machine
over
here
and
the
democrats
over
here,
and
they
will
all
be
paid
for
out
of
tax
funds.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
if
the
recommendations
of
the
secretary
of
state
who
is
here
to
decide
this
lawsuit
are
carried
out.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
it
was
a
message,
special
message
and
it
has
included
as
an
exhibit
in
the
el
paso
brief,
and
we
hardly
concur
with
this
recommendations.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
well,
certainly.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
well,
nobody
has
intervened
on
our
side.
to
be
perfectly
frank
about
it,
it
is
not
politically
expedient
for
an
office
holder
to
become
involved
in
a
controversy
of
this
nature.
he
loses
votes
no
matter
what
he
does.
it
is
a
hot
potato,
and
you
will
find
that
they
are
not
here,
unless
they
have
been
sued.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
thank
you
sir.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
yes.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
background
of
the
filling
fee
is
that
it
was
designed
along
with
the
poll
tax
to
exclude
blacks
from
the
party
primaries
in
texas.
the
poll
tax
was
adopted
into
the
state
constitution
in
1902,
and
the
filling
fee
was
adopted
by
the
legislature
in
1911.
in
united
states
versus
texas,
judge
thornberry
said
that
one
of
the
main
purposes
of
the
poll
tax
was
to
disenfranchise
the
negro
voter,
and
we
maintain
that
the
purpose
of
the
filling
fee
was
to
finance
these
five
primaries,
which
have
been
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
five
different
times.
now,
the
very
fact
that
words
indicating
race
are
not
mentioned
in
the
statute
does
not
mean
that
race
can
not
be
a
picture
because
the
very
act
of
adopting
an
economic
status
standard
for
a
person
who
seeks
elective
office
is
automatically
placing
a
race
standard
in
effect.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
no
your
honor.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
i
pointed
out
in
my
brief
that
the
filling
fees
stand
to
keep
indigents
from
filling.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
yes.
but
it
also
--
when
you
talk
about
indigents,
you
are
talking
more
about
minority
parties
than
you
are
whites,
and
you
are
talking
more
about
women
than
you
are
men.
i
have
some
tables
in
my
brief
to
illustrate
that.
now,
in
texas
in
addition
to
the
blacks,
we
have
the
browns,
and
mr.
morehead
pointed
out
that
it
is
fairly
easy
to
get
on
the
election
ballot
in
the
general
election
as
a
write-in
candidate.
well,
in
the
brief
filed
from
el
paso,
there
is
a
table
over
in
the
back
showing
write-in
candidates
in
the
november
1970,
general
election,
the
last
page
86,
and
there
were
398
write-in
votes.
so
that
is
an
exercise
in
futility
to
attempt
to
get
on
the
general
election
ballot
as
a
write-in
candidate.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
this
is
a
third
party,
and
a
group
attempted
that
last
year
called
latassa
univa
(ph)
and
the
supreme
court
of
texas
turned
them
down
over
technicality.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
yes.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
no.
they
apparently
had
enough
percentages
in
at
least
one
or
two
counties.
they
were
trying
to
get
on
in
five
counties
as
i
remember
correctly.
there
was
a
dissenting
opinion
which
indicated
that
this
group
was
acting
in
good
faith,
but
they
had
the
conflicting
opinions
of
what
statute
meant
from
two
to
three
different
state
officials,
and
nobody
understood
what
the
statute
was
and
so
they
were
not
allowed
on
the
ballot.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
right,
in
the
third
party
column,
alright.
now
bringing
that
down
to
county
level,
he
mentioned
the
figure
500
signatures
as
a
maximum,
that
is
true.
but
since,
this
case
has
been
decided,
the
legislature
of
texas
has
done
a
remarkable
plastic
surgery
job
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
they
have
enacted
what
is
called
house
bill
five
and
i
am
not
sure
when
the
bandages
come
off,
but
i
think
january
the
1st.
now,
in
that
particular
house
bill
five,
the
requirement
to
get
on
as
a
write-in
candidate
is
10%
of
the
people
who
voted
for
governor
in
your
party
at
the
last
general
election,
which
in
tarrant
county
would
be
6,211
signatures
and
they
have
to
be
sworn
too
before
a
notary,
and
the
notary
in
texas
is
entitled
to
a
$0.50
statutory
fee
which
would
mean
over
$3,000
just
a
notary
fees
to
get
the
signatures.
now
that
is
not
$500
which
is
all
that
requires
to
get
on
as
a
third
party
candidate.
but
over
6000
to
get
into
the
democratic
primary
as
a
write-in
candidate,
and
in
addition
to
that,
you
have
to
sign
and
swear
to
your
popazao
and
humiliate
and
degrade
yourself
by
helping
to
establish
and
perpetuate
a
cash
system.
i
do
not
see
any
need
for
that,
but
there
it
is.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
yes.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
yes,
the
test
does
not
exhibit
in
the
state’s
brief.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
yes.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
now,
it
is
also
a
temporary
measure
that
expires
at
the
end
of
1972,
so
nobody
really
knows
what
it
means.
now,
with
the
reference
to
mr.
morehead’s
statement
about
two
sets
of
voting
officials,
the
secretary
of
state
himself
who
is
a
chief
election
officer
for
the
state
of
texas
has
recommended
in
a
message
to
the
last
legislature
that
a
unitary
primary
system
be
established
and
that
it
be
paid
for
out
of
tax
bonds
by
the
county
and
by
the
state
and
so
we
would
eliminate
some
of
the
cost
of
having
the
duplicating
primaries,
if
that
recommendation
is
followed.
now,
i
maintain
and
i
have
all
throughout
that
the
filling
fee
is
a
poll
tax
imposed
on
a
citizen
who
wants
to
run
for
office
and
vote
for
himself.
now
in
texas,
you
have
what
is
called
a
cost
deposit
of
$50
for
a
person
who
wants
to
run
for
county
office.
he
pays
that
at
the
same
time
that
he
files
his
application
to
run.
then,
after
the
executive
committee
has
had
a
chance
to
meet
and
make
the
party
assessments,
at
that
time,
he
has
to
add
up
additional
sums
of
money
running
up
in
several
thousand
dollars.
this
last
year
in
tarrant
county,
the
filling
fee
assessed
by
the
executive
committee
of
the
party
was
32%
of
the
annual
salary
which
is
a
very
large
sum
of
money,
and
as
mr.
morehead
pointed
out,
of
the
25
tarrant
county
officials
on
the
primary
ballot
in
the
democratic
primary
last
year,
only
two
of
them
had
opponents
because
of
these
high
filling
fees.
and
of
the
total
of
over
$200,000
received
by
the
chairman
of
tarrant
county
democratic
party
in
1970,
77%
of
that
money
came
from
the
incomes
themselves.
there
was
nobody
else
who
could
afford
to
pay
and
it
is
outside
of
the
record
but
of
course,
many
of
them
found
difficulty
in
paying
it
to.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
i
think
not,
i
think
they
are
unconstitutional
to
everybody,
even
as
the
poll
tax
is
unconstitutional
to
everybody,
and
with
reference
to
the
poll
tax
once
more,
i
would
like
to
remind
the
court
of
harman
versus
forssenius
in
that
case
it
was
the
virginia
case,
the
twenty-fourth
amendment
had
been
adopted
outlawing
the
poll
tax
in
federal
elections,
in
the
state
of
virginia
to
get
around
this
ruling
fairly
passed
a
statute
that
made
it
possible
for
anybody
who
wanted
to
avoid
the
payment
of
poll
tax
to
file
an
affidavit
instead,
and
the
affidavit
testified
that
the
person
had
been
a
resident
for
so
many
months
and
that
he
intended
to
remain
a
resident
throughout
until
the
election
was
over.
but
you
see
in
our
case,
we
have
harman
versus
forssenius
all
over
again
except
instead
of
one
affidavit
we
have
to
file
6,100
affidavits
and
i
think
that
6,100
times
is
as
bad
as
harman
versus
forssenius
of
course,
prejudice
did
not
matter.
of
course
i
have
represented
these
people
who
just
flat
have
not
been
able
to
pay
the
filling
fees
that
have
been
demanded.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
that
is
right!
and
it
was
so
stipulated
by
the
other
side.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
there
were
three
different
plaintiffs
in
the
case.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
right.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
that
is
right.
two
of
them
were
lawsuits
incidentally.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
no
sir,
it
is
applied
to
all.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
that
is
my
understanding.
yes.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
well,
there
is
the
question
of
the
low
and
narrow
fee,
there
is
some
sort
of
hesitation
on
the
part
of
judge
thornberry,
if
i
remember
correctly
and
he
was
concern
about
wetherington
case
over
in
florida,
which
held
that
reasonable
filling
fees
maybe
constitutional.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
and
i
think
he
was
trying
to
take
that
really
into
account
when
he
said
possibly
a
low
and
narrow
fee
might
be
constitutional,
he
did
not
say
it
was.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
sir
he
wrote
conquering
opinion.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
no
sir
and
the
court
asked
a
while
ago
about
was
there
any
first
amendment
case
other
than
ours
and
the
duncantell
case
which
was
decided
in
houston
on
october
the
27th,
specifically
says
that
the
right
to
run
for
elective
office
is
inextricably
woven
into
the
fabric
of
the
first
amendment
and
one
of
my
co-counsel
here
has
pointed
out
to
me
that
williams
v.
rhodes
also
was
decided
on
the
basis
of
the
first
amendment.
but
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
first
amendment
is
much
more
important
in
this
particular
part.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
right.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
well,
the
right
to
associate
is
a
part
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
yes
sir.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
yes
sir.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
that
is
right,
the
whole
state
of
texas
and
the
political
parties
are
all
enjoined.
now
with
reference
to
the
standard
to
be
employed,
as
i
understand
it,
there
are
three
different
standards
that
can
be
employed,
the
first
is
whether
or
not
the
articulated
state
goal
can
be
accomplished
in
some
less
drastic
means
than
the
one
employed
by
the
state.
and
under
crammer,
that
question
needs
to
be
answered
first
before
you
go
into
the
question
of
whether
you
apply
the
compelling
justification
test
or
the
rational
interest
test.
and
i
take
the
position
that
there
is
another
less
drastic
way
of
regulating
the
ballot
in
nominating
petitions
and
there
are
34
offices
included
on
the
tarrant
county
ballot
in
1970
which
is
given
in
one
of
the
exhibits
in
my
brief
and
21
of
those
offices
could
come
off
the
ballot
if
we
have
legislation
permitting
single
member
legislative
districts
and
single
member
judicial
districts
for
tarrant
county.
that
trouble
with
the
nominating
petition
i
think
would
be
a
less
drastic
means
than
a
filling
fee
to
regulate
the
ballot.
but
coming
back
to
harper,
harper
plainly
says
that
any
fee
is
per
se
unconstitutional
because
it
is
irrelevant,
the
man's
economic
status
has
no
relevancy
whatsoever
to
his
qualifications
as
a
voter
and
mr.
morehead
pointed
out
the
case
from
georgia,
the
turner
versus
fouche
case,
he
mistakenly
said
that
that
involved
a
filling
fee
when
actually
it
did
not,
it
required
an
ownership
of
real
property.
but
i
think
that
the
ownership
of
real
property
is
equivalent
to
the
ownership
of
personal
property
except
in
texas,
the
state
takes
the
personal
property
and
the
state
of
georgia
allows
the
man
to
keep
his
one
square
inch
of
real
property.
shelton
versus
tucker,
the
breadth
of
legislative
abridgment
must
be
reviewed
in
the
light
of
less
drastic
means
for
achieving
the
same
basic
purpose.
williams
versus
illinois,
mr.
justice
harlan
in
a
separate
opinion
conquering
the
matrix
of
recent
equal
protection
analysis
is
that
the
rule
of
statutory
classifications
which
either
are
based
upon
certain
suspect
criteria
or
affect
fundamental
right
will
be
held
to
the
equal
protection
unless
justified
by
a
compelling
government
entries
citing
sheparo,
harper
and
williams
and
in
this
case,
we
not
only
have
the
fundamental
constitutional
right
to
run
for
elective
office,
but
it
is
concomitant,
the
fundamental
constitutional
right
to
vote
for
the
candidate
who
wants
to
run
and
in
addition
to
those
two
fundamental
constitutional
rights
which
were
involved,
we
have
also
this
suspect
legislative
criterion
of
poverty.
we
have
the
filling
fee
limits
the
place
on
the
ballot
to
the
man
with
money
and
this
means
that
his
economic
status
has
become
a
qualification
for
office
and
all
of
the
three
offices
involved
here
are
offices
for
the
qualifications
are
set
by
the
constitution
of
the
state,
and
it
is
beyond
the
power
of
the
state
legislature
to
amend
the
constitution
of
the
state
and
pass
additional
requirements.
and
economic
status
is
absolutely
irrelevant,
the
edward’s
case
held
this.
recently
the
graham
case
has
held
it,
and
in
the
graham
case,
as
fas
as
i
remember
the
case
correctly,
there
was
a
case
involving
aliens
and
the
court
said
that
an
alien
had
this
right,
regardless
of
his
nationality
to
welfare
benefits
and
it
was
very
important
that
he
should
have
it
and
in
our
case,
we
are
not
representing
aliens,
we
are
representing
american
citizens
and
american
citizens
who
are
not
asking
for
a
handout,
they
are
not
asking
to
go
on
the
welfare
roles.
they
do
not
have
any
money
but
they
are
asking
for
a
job.
they
are
asking
for
a
right
to
be
considered
for
elective
office,
which
under
turner
versus
fouche,
i
think
they
have
a
basic
fundamental
right
to
be
considered
for
elective
office
without
these
other
qualifications,
which
are
absolutely
unconstitutional.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
that
is
right.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
no
sir,
the
opinion
there
says
that
the
political
parties
plural
of
the
state
are
enjoined,
but
let
me
point
that
in
my
candidate’s
particular
race,
there
were
no
republican
candidates
stalled.
if
i
remember
correctly,
there
were
only
the
candidates
in
tarrant
county,
texas
only
filled
candidates
in
four
races,
four
county
races
out
of
30
somewhat.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
that
is
right.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
well,
they
hold
on
if
a
party
get
a
certain
number
of
votes
in
the
november
election,
they
have
to
hold
a
primary.
but
the
republican
party
is
not
able
to
collect
these
filling
fees
because
their
nomination
really
is
not
worth
in
all
full
lot
and
they
have
to
use
volunteers
help
at
the
post,
whereas
the
workers
in
the
democratic
primaries
are
paid
$2
an
hour
out
of
the
filling
fees.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
yes,
they
have
fees
but
quite
frequently,
they
return
the
fees
and
do
not
use
them.
but
mostly,
they
try
to
use
volunteer
help
and
quite
frequently,
they
do
not
use
the
voting
machine
because
the
paper
ballots
are
cheaper.
there
is
a
newspaper
clipping
from
the
dallas
morning
news
in
el
paso
brief
which
i
would
like
to
refer
the
court
to
explaining
the
problems
with
reference
to
republican
party.
but
if
the
secretary
of
state's
recommendation
--
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
pardon?
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
well,
no
this
was
statewide
race.
the
republicans
are
able
to
win
statewide
--
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
except
in
statewide
races.
but
if
the
filing
fees
go
out
and
the
recommendations
of
the
secretary
of
state
are
followed
by
the
legislature
and
we
have
a
unitary
primary,
then
we
will
have
greater
participation
on
part
of
all,
because
everybody
will
go
to
the
same
place
to
vote
just
as
in
november.
the
republicans
will
go
to
this
machine
over
here
and
the
democrats
over
here,
and
they
will
all
be
paid
for
out
of
tax
funds.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
if
the
recommendations
of
the
secretary
of
state
who
is
here
to
decide
this
lawsuit
are
carried
out.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
it
was
a
message,
special
message
and
it
has
included
as
an
exhibit
in
the
el
paso
brief,
and
we
hardly
concur
with
this
recommendations.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
well,
certainly.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
well,
nobody
has
intervened
on
our
side.
to
be
perfectly
frank
about
it,
it
is
not
politically
expedient
for
an
office
holder
to
become
involved
in
a
controversy
of
this
nature.
he
loses
votes
no
matter
what
he
does.
it
is
a
hot
potato,
and
you
will
find
that
they
are
not
here,
unless
they
have
been
sued.
mr.
a.
l.
crouch
thank
you
sir.
