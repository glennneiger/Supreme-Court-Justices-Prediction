unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
any
other
substantial
limitations
or
requirements
with
respect
to
the
getting
out
of
ballot
by
petition.
do
the
signers
have
to
be
people
who
have
not
voted
in
either
primary
for
example?
unknown
speaker
and
by
1%
of
the
people,
you
mean
1%
of
the
eligible
voters?
unknown
speaker
mr.
morehead,
why
would
you
not
do
that
on
a
general
election
too?
unknown
speaker
why
would
you
not
split
the
cost
of
the
general
election
among
the
candidates
who
are
on
the
ballot
of
the
general
election?
unknown
speaker
all
i
am
saying
is,
is
not
your
argument
equally
applicable
to
the
primary?
how
do
you
differentiate
to
the
primary
and
the
general
election?
when
you
argue
this
way
and
in
addition
you
say
that
the
primary
is
an
extension
of
the
general.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
the
only
one
i
can
think
of
too.
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
district
court’s
excuse
for
applying
a
more
strict
test,
that
it
is
the
base
it
is
holding
on
the
first
amendment?
unknown
speaker
do
you
challenge
the
holding
that
the
first
amendment
is
relevant,
it
protects
the
right
to
run
for
a
state
office?
unknown
speaker
are
there
cases
like
that
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
did
not
understand
that,
if
i
understand
what
it
is,
if
they
tell
you
about
the
first
amendment,
was
it
not.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
right
to
vote
on
state
election
protected
by
the
first
amendment?
unknown
speaker
the
federal
right
to
vote
under
the
first
amendment
in
state
election?
unknown
speaker
how
many
candidates
were
there
for
district
judge?
unknown
speaker
with
each
unopposed?
unknown
speaker
had
still
to
oppose,
9,000.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
salary
of
the
district
judge?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
term?
unknown
speaker
did
the
fees
ever
exceed
the
salary
of
the
officer,
any
officer?
unknown
speaker
do
you
understand
mr.
morehead
that
the
district
court
held
that
these
--
first
of
all
that
these
fees
are
unconstitutional
only
as
applied
to
people
who
could
not
afford
to
pay
them.
unknown
speaker
is
to
pay
the
cost.
unknown
speaker
well,
by
the
use
of
the
word
absolute,
do
you
think
they
apply
that
a
person
who
could
afford
this
fee
could
be
required
to
pay
it.
but
somebody
who
filed
an
affidavit
of
indigency,
could
not
pay.
unknown
speaker
mr.
morehead,
i
have
typically
with
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
stewart
that
you
said
to
mr.
justice
white
earlier,
the
concluding
paragraph
of
the
opinion,
seems
to
rest
this
squarely
on
first
amendment
grounds
without
reference
to
an
equal
protection
or
other
basis
for
the
decision,
am
i
wrong
about
that?
unknown
speaker
this
last
paragraph,
it
says
in
granting
declaratory
relief,
is
there
a
difference?
certainly,
the
last
paragraph,
the
rest
of
that,
was
not
squarely
on
the
first
amendment?
unknown
speaker
and
it
is
rested
on
page
10a
on
the
first
amendment
and
equal
protection,
it
does
not
help
very
much
that
the
equal
protection
is
also
added
if
payment
of
a
fee
violates
the
first
amendment,
does
that
make
any
difference
between
--.
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
know
of
any
cases
where
the
first
amendment
has
been
applied
to
guarantee
someone
except
this
one
relates
to
that
in
the
state
in
an
election
for
state
office.
unknown
speaker
you
understand
then
that
the
court
is
holding
at
least
its
reasoning
in
its
final
paragraph
of
its
opinion
would
hold
unconstitutional,
any
file
fees
of
any
kind,
the
$10
fee.
unknown
speaker
are
you
arguing
a
different
basis
for
sustaining
the
judges
below
that
the
court
used?
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
saying
you
should
not
do
that,
but
i
just
wondered
if.
unknown
speaker
now,
this
is
an
equal
protection
argument.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
mr.
morehead
was
not
talking
about
the
write-in
vote
to
the
general
election,
but
getting
a
name
on
the
ballot
at
the
general
election
by
nominating
petition
of
1%.
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
technicality,
what
do
you
mean?
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
technicality,
that
they
had
less
than
1%?
unknown
speaker
but
in
any
event
that
mr.
morehead
was
not
talking
about
write-in
votes
at
the
general
election,
but
talking
about
a
man's
ability
or
as
you
say
inability
to
get
his
name
on
the
ballot
at
the
general
election
so
--
unknown
speaker
there
is
a
legislation,
so
conditional
legislation
enacted
by
the
state
legislature
which
comes
into
effect
depending
upon
the
result
of
this.
unknown
speaker
decision
by
this
court.
unknown
speaker
is
that
set
out
in
full
somewhere,
i
saw
you,
no
reference.
unknown
speaker
in
the
state’s
brief?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
do
you
understand
the
holding
of
the
district
court
in
this
case
to
have
been
--
that
these
fees
are
unconstitutional
only
as
applied
to
those
who
cannot
afford
to
pay
them?
unknown
speaker
well,
so
your
clients,
you
just
as
i
understood
here,
our
people
cannot
afford
to
pay
it.
unknown
speaker
and
the
--
unknown
speaker
and
all
applies
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
at
least
three
consolidated
cases
were
people
who
alleged
that
they
could
not
afford
to
pay
the
fees.
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
i
wondered,
how
you
understood
the
court’s
decision
just
that
the
fees
are
unconstitutional
only
as
applied
to
those
in
your
client’s
position?
unknown
speaker
it
is
applied
to
everybody.
unknown
speaker
do
you
further
understand
that
the
court
to
have
held
that
all
fees
would
be
unconstitutional
even
on
$1
fee?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
he
is
in
the
right
opinion
did
he?
unknown
speaker
but
the
court's
opinion
does
not
talk
about
that,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
talk
about
the
right
to
associate.
unknown
speaker
but
they
did
not
have
the
right
to
vote.
unknown
speaker
right,
it
is
definitely,
i
know
that
this
is
page
161
of
the
record,
the
judgment
of
the
three-judge
court
makes
it
explicit
that
the
section
is
declared
unconstitutional
and
that
is
enforcement
enjoined,
i
gather
it
is
everybody
and
that
the
declaration
of
unconstitutionality
is
rested
only
on
because
they
had
infringed
upon
first
amendment
rights
without
any
compelling
justification
and
violation
to
the
first
and
the
fourth
amendments.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
so
i
gather
at
least
on
the
face
of
the
judgment
that
was
over
here,
it
rested
on
the
first
amendment,
right?
unknown
speaker
and
secondly,
it
has
enjoins
its
enforcement
as
to
everybody,
not
merely
as
to
your
impecunious
crime.
unknown
speaker
i
noticed
in
judge
thornberry's
concurring
opinion
that
he
says
one
of
the
things
voters
are
deprived
of
the
opportunity
to
have
their
candidate
considered
for
the
democratic
party
nomination,
if
he
cannot
pose
a
filling
fee
and
he
goes
on,
since
in
the
overwhelming
majority
of
texas
political
offices,
nomination
by
the
democratic
party
is
tantamount
to
election.
it
is
clearly
the
restriction
on
entry
into
the
primary
may
significantly
impair
the
right
to
cast
on
his
vote
effectively
and
so
on,
and
they
are
precluded
by
the
high
filing
fee
from
associating
within
the
established
party.
unknown
speaker
does
this
imply
that
this
law
is
only
applicable
to
the
democratic
party
and
not
to
the
republican
party?
unknown
speaker
that
is
for
republican
party
did
it.
unknown
speaker
do
they
hold
a
primary
or
do
they
do
it
by
convention?
unknown
speaker
so
the
republican
parties
does
not
require
these
fees.
unknown
speaker
and
this
will
be
done
if
what?
unknown
speaker
mr.
crouch,
i
am
a
little
confused,
is
there
any
division
of
opinion
among
the
state
office
holders
of
texas
on
this
suit?
unknown
speaker
some
are
on
one
side.
some
are
on
the
other,
are
they
not?
unknown
speaker
can
they
suspend
it
for
a
moment?
unknown
speaker
well,
hey!
listen
back
there,
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
i
understood
mr.
morehead
to--
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
differently.
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
the
statutory
statement?
unknown
speaker
first,
we
go
back
to
this
country's
beginnings,
races.
in
the
early
days
many
of
the
states
required
people
to
own
property
before
they
were
eligible
to
vote
even
much
lesser
on
for
office.
unknown
speaker
b21.
unknown
speaker
this
decision
of
the
district
court
was
apparently
in
december
of
1970.
unknown
speaker
so
have
there
been
any
elections
since
that
time,
were
there
any
this
past
november?
unknown
speaker
and
have
that
in
the
primary
elections
since
the
court's
decision.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
any
other
substantial
limitations
or
requirements
with
respect
to
the
getting
out
of
ballot
by
petition.
do
the
signers
have
to
be
people
who
have
not
voted
in
either
primary
for
example?
unknown
speaker
and
by
1%
of
the
people,
you
mean
1%
of
the
eligible
voters?
unknown
speaker
mr.
morehead,
why
would
you
not
do
that
on
a
general
election
too?
unknown

why
would
you
not

the
cost
of
