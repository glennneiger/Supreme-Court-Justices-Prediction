justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
customer
does
not
really
choose
either?
it
is
the
mechanic
that
probably
chooses
what
plugs
to
put
in?
justice
potter
stewart
up
to
the
time
of
this
acquisition,
all
general
motor
car
--
general
motors
cars
had
ac
plug?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
correct?
and
all
of
ford
cars
had
champion
plug?
justice
potter
stewart
and
all
chrysler
cars
had
electra
and
the
autolite
plugs?
justice
potter
stewart
right,
but
from
1936
until
the
time
of
its
acquisition,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
if
as
you
tell
us
it
was
the
habit
or
practice
of
mechanics
to
install
as
replacement
plugs,
the
original
equipment
plugs,
why
would
they
have
stocked
all
three
just
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business
because
of
the
so-called
big
three
automobiles?
justice
potter
stewart
did
any
of
the
--
was
ac
--
are
ac
plugs
manufactured
by
general
motors
or
are
they
manufactured
by
a
company
that
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
was
the
only
one
of
the
so-called
big
three
then
that
did
manufacture
its
own
plug?
justice
potter
stewart
after
its
acquisition?
justice
potter
stewart
eltra
does
not
supply,
it
does
not
supply
any
original
equipment,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
order
to
do
that,
you
have
to
sell
way
below
cost?
justice
potter
stewart
exact
point
under
this
decree?
justice
potter
stewart
i
take
it
the
new
company
means
the
so-called
new
fostoria?
justice
potter
stewart
the
divested?
justice
potter
stewart
autolite.
justice
potter
stewart
nevertheless,
you
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
well,
except
here,
you
have
an
explicit
decision
not
to
do
it?
justice
potter
stewart
what
you
just
told
us?
justice
potter
stewart
you
talk
about
the
--
i
think
just
now
you
used
the
word
“mediating
effect”
of
ford,
i
think
in
the
briefs
and
in
the
district
court’s
opinion
it
is
called
the
moderating
effect.
i
do
not
quite
understand
what
it
is?
justice
potter
stewart
it
has
two
aspects
i
gather
and
that
be
understood
--
justice
potter
stewart
right,
now
you
are
talking.
justice
potter
stewart
champion?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
price
was
told
6
cents,
but
i
gather
as
588
cents
(voice
overlap)
on
the
oe
price?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
standard
throughout
the
industry?
justice
potter
stewart
sell
them
to
ford
and
ford
sends
in
to
his
distributors
and
dealers?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
in
recent
years,
the
majority
of
the
replacement
of
the
aftermarket
was
distributed
to
filling
stations
and
service
stations?
justice
potter
stewart
not
by
ford?
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
since
the
acquisition?
justice
potter
stewart
yes
but
i
am
talking
about
this
moderating
effect
and
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
moderating
effect
on
price
--
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
price
of
champion
plugs?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
aftermarket,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
from
discriminating
between
the
two
customers
and
also
was
an
indirect
impact
on
the
whole,
on
the
other
makers,
on
their
price?
justice
potter
stewart
but
then
and
we
have
the
--
as
far
as
i
understand
that
and
i
am
not
sure
i
quite
do
this
moderating
effect
but
there
is
a
finding
that
is
almost
no
price
competition?
justice
potter
stewart
where
is
it,
eltra,
you
mean?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
when
you
say
they,
you
mean
champion
for
50
years
when
they
say
they
used
to
be
able
to
sell.
it
was
the
champion
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
they
were
not
able
to?
justice
potter
stewart
for
50
to
60
years,
it
was
champion
and
only
champion?
justice
potter
stewart
who
supplies
them?
justice
potter
stewart
just
before
we
start
again,
who
supplies
the
american
motors
or
do
they
make
theirs?
justice
potter
stewart
100%?
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
is
something
in
the
record
in
effect
to
the
merit
there
is
some
risk
that
american
motors
might
not
get
this
way
below
cost
price?
justice
potter
stewart
or
danger
that
they
might
lose
it,
that
is
what
i
mean?
justice
potter
stewart
now
they
get
this?
justice
potter
stewart
would
eltra
be
an
eligible
purchaser
of
new
fostoria?
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
that
eltra
is
what
remains
of
the
original
autolite?
justice
potter
stewart
but
only
as
you
told
us
of
tiny
share
of
the
spark
plug?
justice
potter
stewart
an
eligible
purchase?
justice
potter
stewart
we
are
talking
about
this,
my
brother
white
suggested
in
his
question,
just
one
plant
of
fostoria,
ohio,
are
we
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
unless
eltra
does
purchase
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
customer
does
not
really
choose
either?
it
is
the
