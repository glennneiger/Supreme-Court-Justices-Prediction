mr.
whitney
north
seymour
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
going
to
try
to
reserve
a
few
minutes
for
reply.
this
is
a
direct
appeal
from
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
in
detroit
holding
that
the
acquisition
in
1961
by
ford
motor
company
of
the
spark
plug
business
and
the
name
of
the
autolite
company
to
enable
ford
to
supply
its
own
needs
for
original
installation
of
spark
plugs
and
also
to
supply
replacement
plugs
to
others
and
the
acquisition
occurred
after
ford
had
been
the
customer
of
champion,
a
leading
company
in
the
business
for
50
years.
the
court
held
that
the
acquisition
violated
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
he
directed
divestiture
and
then
ended
seven
other
extraordinary
injunctions.
first,
he
enjoined
ford
from
going
into
the
business
of
making
spark
plugs
by
internal
entry
for
10
years.
the
judgment
enjoined
ford
from
making
any
plugs
under
its
own
name
for
five
years,
not
marketing
any
plugs
under
its
own
name
for
five
years
and
required
ford
to
buy
half
its
requirements
for
five
years
from
the
purchaser
of
the
divested
--
the
portion
divested.
when
the
case
was
tried,
batteries
were
also
involved,
but
they
dropped
out
and
they
are
not
now
involved,
that
matter
having
been
satisfactory
disposed
of.
ford
challenges
the
decision
of
the
district
court
as
to
the
violation
and
submits
that
even
if
there
was
a
violation,
divestiture
in
this
case
was
not
the
best
remedy
because
other
remedies
which
i
will
mention
were
better
and
challenges
all
the
extraordinary
injunctions
with
particular
weight
on
the
injunction
against
the
internal
entry
and
the
injunction
against
the
use
of
the
ford
name
which
it
regards
as
definitely
anticompetitive.
now,
i
think
it
is
important
to
understand
the
nature
of
this
industry
because
as
in
other
cases,
the
impact
of
section
7
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
industry
in
a
particular
situation
involved.
general
motors
has
made
its
own
spark
plugs
since
1909.
in
that
year,
it
acquired
the
then
champion
spark
plug
business
and
had
since
marketed
its
spark
plug
under
the
name
of
ac,
under
the
letters
ac
and
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition,
general
motors
had
30%
of
the
spark
plug
market.
when
i
say
the
spark
plug
market,
i
am
talking
for
the
most
part
about
the,
not
the
original
installations
but
the
market,
in
the
so-called
after-market,
the
replacement
plugs,
that
is
where
the
large
amount
of
the
plug
business
is
done.
champion
went
back
into
the
spark
plug
business
after
selling
to
general
motors
and
has
supplied
or
had
at
the
time
of
that
acquisition,
supplied
ford
for
50
years.
and
in
1936,
autolite
came
into
the
business
and
began
to
supply
chrysler
and
champion
got
50%
of
the
business,
it
had
50%
of
the
business
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition,
that
is
general
motors
30,
champion
50,
and
autolite
about
15,
and
the
balance
of
few
percent
was
sort
of
--
were
spread
among
small
manufactures
mostly
in
the
private
brand
market.
now,
the
private
brand
market
is
the
market
served
by
such
companies
as
sears,
roebuck,
and
montgomery
ward
and
other
mass
merchandisers
and
some
of
the
oil
companies
who
market
spark
plugs
under
their
own
trade
names.
in
1960
to
1961,
in
those
years,
chrysler
got
very
concerned,
i
mean,
autolite
got
very
concerned
because
it
saw
signs
that
chrysler
might
be
getting
ready
to
go
into
the
spark
plug
business
itself
and
that
might
leave
it
with
an
expensive
plant
which
the
court
described,
below
described
as
a
potential
albatross
if
it
could
not
do
something
about
it.
and
so
it
came
to
ford
and
offered
to
sell
the
spark
plug
business
to
ford
and
the
autolite
name
for
spark
plugs
and
other
uses.
and
they
worked
out
a
deal
under
which
ford
brought
this
assets
including
the
battery
assets
which
are
no
longer
involved
for
a
total
of
$28
million
and
autolite
became
eltra.
so
that
there
was
a
new
company
with
a
name
of
eltra
created
which
carried
on
the
portion
of
the
business
not
sold
by
autolite
to
ford
and
eltra
has
built
a
spark
plug
plant
in
alabama
and
is
in
the
business
of
supplying
spark
plugs
largely
for
the
private
brand
market.
ford,
in
connection
with
the
sale
agreed
to
buy
12
million
plugs
from
eltra
over
a
period
of
two
years
and
also
to
provide
it
with
certain
ceramic
parts
and
thereupon
ford
was
in
the
business
under
the
autolite
name.
champion
became
chrysler’s
supplier
and
took
part
of
--
a
large
part
of
the
year
to
change
over
from
champion
plugs
to
autolite
plugs
and
worked
out
the
technical
difficulties
involved
and
also
to
begin
the
process
of
improving
the
distribution
systems
and
it
took
about
the
same
for
chrysler
to
get
started
with
its
new
supplier,
champion.
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition
or
just
before
the
acquisition,
ford
had
some
14%
of
the
spark
plug
business
and
after
the
acquisition,
ford's
percentage
gradually
came
up
and
champion’s
went
down
and
general
motor’s
remained
about
the
same,
although
it
has
gone
up
a
little
bit.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
the
champion
figure
originally
was
50%
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes,
1960-1961,
just
before
the
acquisition
and
ford’s
was
30
and
autolite
was
about
15.
and
when
ford
came
in,
the
autolite
business
began
to
go
up
so
that
by
--
about
19
--
in
the
late
1960s,
ford’s
business
was
up
to
about
19%
and
champion’s
business
had
come
down
from
50
to
about
40
and
general
motors
had
remained
about
the
same,
perhaps
gone
up
a
little
bit.
it
is
not
correct
as
the
government
suggests
that
this
was
all
automatic,
that
all
happened
was
that
the
champions
business
went
down
and
the
autolite
business
went
up
and
chrysler
was
changing
suppliers.
there
was
active
and
intense
competition
in
the
after-market
and
it
was
a
result
of
that
competition
that
these
changes
and
percentages
took
place
through,
it
seemed
like
relatively
small
changes
in
percentage
but
each
percentage
point
was
about
4
million
plugs
and
it
is
a
substantial
amount
of
business
where
involving
thousands
and
thousands
of
transactions.
the
--
i
think
your
honors
will
be
satisfied
when
i
finish
describing
the
industry
that
historically
there
have
been,
since
1936,
only
three
major
suppliers
to
the
automobile
companies
and
that
before
that,
there
were
only
two
and
that
the
business
does
not
accommodate
itself
to
more
than
three
major
suppliers.
there
is
this
private
market
business,
but
inevidently
there
are
in
this
business
i
think
there
is
room
only
for
three
major
suppliers
and
that
is
because
of
the
special
nature
of
the
plug
in
the
business
which
are
not
joined
to.
without
going
into
any
detail
of
the
mechanics,
the
spark
plug
is
a
small
but
essential
part
of
an
automobile
and
the
truck
and
also
used
in
tractors
and
long-horse
and
so
on.
it
has,
as
you
know
two
electrodes.
it
is
inserted
in
the
cylinder
to
jump
a
spark
caused
by
power
from
the
generator
to
ignite
the
mixture
of
oil
and
gasoline
and
air
in
the
cylinder
and
cause
the
explosion
which
drives
the
engine.
the
plugs
are
carefully
engineered
to
particular
mix
and
models.
it
takes
the
plug
manufacturers
and
the
automobile
manufacturers
work
closely
together
over
a
long
period
of
time
to
get
just
the
right
form
and
construction
of
the
plug
and
to
make
it
deal
most
effectively
with
the
particular
model
for
which
it
is
used.
just
as
an
example,
i
think
ford
now
makes
some
80
different
motors
and
has
80
different
plugs
for
those
motors.
the
use
of
the
wrong
plug
can
cause
malfunctioning,
affect
the
exhaust
fumes
from
the
engine
and
could
cause
serious
damage.
now,
the
plugs
are
installed
at
the
factory
in
what
is
called
oe
installation,
that
is
original
equipment
installation
and
the
automobile
manufacturer
buys
or
makes
these
plugs
and
they
are
put
in
the
car
and
then
the
car
is
sold
and
about
18
months
after
the
car
is
sold,
the
average
kind
of
owner
goes
around
and
gets
a
tune
up
and
has
a
replacement
of
the
plugs.
and
the
plugs
are
replaced
about
five
times
during
the
use
of
the
average
automobile
and
that
means
that
on
a
six-cylinder
car,
there
are
30
plugs
that
are
bought
over
that
period,
on
eight-cylinder
40
plugs.
the
facts
i
am
stating
i
think
there
is
no
dispute
about
--
were
at
one
about,
think
the
nature
of
the
market
and
the
facts
about
the
market
and
indeed
many
of
them
are
stipulated.
most
replacement
plugs
are
inserted
by
mechanics
in
the
course
of
a
tune-up.
one
does
not
ordinarily
take
his
car
around
and
says,
i
need
a
new
spark
plug,
but
usually
he
is
going
to
a
garage
or
a
service
station
or
some
other
place
to
have
the
car
tuned-up
and
gone
over
and
at
that
time
that
the
mechanic
ordinarily
inserts
the
new
plugs.
and
the
new
plugs
are
such
a
minor
part
of
the
cost
of
that
operation
that
really
price
and
cost
of
the
plugs
to
the
customer
are
no
moment
so
that
there
is
little
if
any
price
competition
at
that
level.
the
mechanic
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
that
is
right.
the
mechanic
on
the
basis
of
his
experience
and
knowledge
ordinarily
makes
the
choice.
now,
he
chooses
the
plug
which
ordinarily,
the
plug
which
was
originally
installed.
this
propensity
of
mechanics
to
use
the
plug
originally
installed
is
called
in
this
record
sometimes
the
oe
type
which
merely
means
the
propensity
of
mechanics
to
use
the
same
plug
in
replacement
that
was
there
originally
and
he
does
this
because
he
knows
about
the
fact
that
the
plug
was
originally
designed
for
that
car
and
he
does
not
want
to
take
into
risk
about
it.
he
does
not
want
to
think
that
he
is
smarter
than
the
engineering
department
that
designed
it.
now,
there
are
all
purpose
plugs
manufactured
by
all
of
these
companies
and
the
average
garage
man
or
service
station
man
stocks
some
of
the
plugs,
but
usually
not
all
the
plugs.
usually,
if
the
record
shows
that
sometimes
the
garage
owner
or
the
filling
station
owner
has
only
the
ac
plug
or
sometimes
the
champion
plug,
but
usually
both
of
those
because
they
are
so
popular
and
then
at
the
time
of
this
acquisition,
probably
few
of
these
places
also
stock
the
autolite
plugs
and
one
of
the
great
efforts
here
in
the
competitive
struggle
has
been
to
get
more
and
more
of
these
places
to
stock
the
autolite
plug.
if
they
do
not
have
the
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
that
is
right.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
that
is
right.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
after
1936.
before
1936,
general
motors
had
supplied
chrysler.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
that
is
right.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well,
generally
speaking
there
are
perhaps
two
reasons
as
far
as
the
autolite
plug
and
the
ford
champion
plug
to
take
that
first.
ford,
tried
to
distribute
these
plugs
through
its
franchise
dealers
and
the
franchise
dealers
were
no
longer
handling
at
or
about
the
time
of
the
acquisition
as
many
of
the
installations
as
the
filling
stations
and
others.
and
the
filling
station
proprietors
and
the
garage
proprietors
were
concerned
about
not
having
too
large
an
inventory
and
actually
they
would
maintain
an
inventory
which
would
do
the
best
job
in
supplying
plugs
for
the
largest
possible
number
without
too
much
of
an
investment.
so
there
was
a
tendency
to
have
a
major
lines
and
the
autolite
line
had
difficulty
getting
in
as
indicated
by
the
fact
that
between
about
the
time
of
the
acquisition
in
the
late
1960s,
the
percentage
of
ford
sales
in
the
aftermarket
crept
up
some
5%
which
i
think
is
represented
by
the
increase
stocking
of
these
plugs
in
the
market.
now,
the
--
i
mentioned
the
all
purpose
plug,
all
these
companies
make
all
purpose
plugs
so
that
if
the
mechanic
does
not
have
the
oe
plug
at
the
time,
he
can
try
to
do
the
best
he
can
by
using
an
all
purpose
plug
which
is
a
sort
of
a
compromise.
it
is
not
as
good
as
many
people
think
as
the
oe
plug,
but
it
is
better
than
a
plug
that
was
made
for
a
wholly
different
kind
of
a
car
and
that
is
a
kind
of
compromise
solution.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
that
was
so
for
a
long
time
and
the
business
are
trying
to
get
them
to
carry
three
took
a
lot
of
effort
and
that
is
what
went
off.
now,
the
oe
use
is
of
such
importance
to
the
manufacturer
that
champion,
beginning
in
1920,
started
what
is
now
as
the
six
cent
oe
price,
it
began
to
sell
the
plugs
for
original
installation
at
6
cents
and
then
everybody
--
all
the
manufacturers
followed
soon
so
that
all
the
plugs
were
original
equipment
installation
were
sold
at
6
cents
and
the
cost
of
the
plugs
was
three
or
four
times
as
much
as
that.
so
that
the
manufacturer
used
this
low
oe
price
to
get
in
and
get
the
business
and
then
he
had
to
make
up
for
the
loss
on
that
sale
by
a
higher
price
on
the
sales
for
the
aftermarket,
the
replacement
plugs.
and
so
this
is
a
very
important
part
of
the
getting
into
the
business
and
holding
the
business
and
is
a
fact
of
life
which
is
unusual
in
this
industry
i
think.
the
--
i
have
already
mentioned
the
fact
that
because
of
the
fact
that
the
plugs
are
originally
installed
as
part
of
other
work,
that
their
prices
of
little
or
no
moment
and
this
and
one
of
the
reasons
of
the
price
in
the
business
has
been
so
stable
is
that
in
1953,
all
of
the
plug
manufacturers
had
cases
before
the
federal
trade
commission
which
involved
the
question
of
whether
they
could
distinguish
in
price
between
the
various
types
of
distributors
who
distributed
their
plugs
including
the
other
companies
who
wanted
to
distribute
their
plugs
and
the
federal
trade
commission
held
that
they
had
to
give
the
same
price
to
everybody
in
the
distribution
chain
and
this
has
naturally
kept
the
plug
manufacturers
from
lowering
their
price
because
if
they
did,
they
had
to
do
it
to
everybody
and
therefore
they
could
not
do
it
in
the
ordinary
competitive
way.
the
court
below
regarded
one
of
the
important
factors
as
to
whether
or
not
the
champion
or
the
ford’s
relation
to
champion
tended
to
moderate
champion’s
price
and
he
held
that
it
did
and
it
was
his
view
that
somehow
ford
being
a
large
customer
of
champion,
moderated
champion’s
price.
now,
on
this
record
that
is
just
a
theory.
there
was
no
proof
and
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
show
that
there
was
any
such
moderation.
i
would
take
it
that
the
original
equipment
price
given
50
years
ago
is
hardly
a
moderation
which
should
still
persist
in
any
realistic
sense
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition.
it
was
really
not
a
moderation
that
was
a
sort
of
a
payment
for
entrance
or
an
arrangement
for
entrance
and
aside
from
that
the
record
does
not
show
any
moderation.
ford
had
to
pay
a
higher
price
in
1959
and
1960
for
its
plugs
than
other
people
did
and
there
is
not
any
evidence
of
moderation.
the
suggestion
is
made
that
the
court
examined
this
carefully
that
ford
was
a
potential
competitor
and
that
under
penn-olin,
somehow
this
acquisition
was
bad.
now,
the
court
took
testimony
and
the
government
tried
very
hard
to
try
to
show
that
ford
was
on
the
verge
of
entering
this
business,
but
the
evidence
the
court
found
did
not
show
that
ford
was
on
the
brink
of
entering
this
business.
there
are
certain
memoranda
in
the
record
which
indicate
that
there
was
a
study
made
to
that
subject,
several
studies
but
they
never
reached
the
point
of
top
level
consideration
and
the
reason
they
did
not
was
that,
and
the
testimony
of
mr.
duffy
in
the
record
which
the
court
accepted,
was
that
plugs
were
available
to
ford
for
oe
installation
at
one-third
of
cost.
ford
did
not
have
at
that
time
any
engineers
who
were
expert
in
the
plug
business
or
even
in
the
ceramic
business
that
they
had
no
distribution
system
which
was
adequate
at
that
time
to
enable
them
to
compete
effectively
in
the
aftermarket
and
then
the
undisputed
evidence
is
and
the
court
recognized
it
and
everybody
recognized
it,
that
after
an
original
oe
installation
of
a
new
plug,
it
takes
five
to
eight
years
to
have
enough
vehicles
on
the
road
with
that
plug
in
them
to
really
do
a
lot
of
business
in
the
aftermarket.
and
so
anybody
going
into
the
plug
business
has
a
major
manufacturer
had
to
face
all
these
difficulties,
the
problem
of
five
to
eight
years
before
he
can
really
realize
on
the
aftermarket.
the
problem
of
the
loss
which
was
involved
in
connection
with
getting
--
having
something
other
than
the
six-cent
price,
the
problem
of
working
out
to
technicalities
and
so
on.
so,
it
is
clear
i
think
that
ford
was
not
a
potential
competitor
and
the
court
did
not
conclude
that
it
was.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
no,
i
believe
and
in
fact
i
believe
they
are
manufactured
by
general
motors
at
one
of
its
divisions.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes,
yes.
at
the
time
ford,
went
in
the
business,
at
the
time
ford
made
the
acquisitions.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
now,
i
want
to
move
along,
i
have
spent
more
time
over
the
industry
than
i
intended
to.
the
court
pointed
out
i
think
that
ford
considered
that
making
this
acquisition
would
enable
it
to
get
into
the
business
and
compete
effectively
and
that
expectation
was
real
honest
because
of
the
competition
has
increased
since
ford
made
this
acquisition
and
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
it
was
not
just
a
slipping
around
of
percentages,
but
it
was
a
genuine
increase
in
competition
in
the
market.
this
acquisition
we
submit
was
pro-competitive
because
it
made
ford
a
--
ford
was
a
stronger
and
more
effective
competitor
than
autolite
had
been,
where
there
were
three
companies
before
the
acquisition,
the
creation
of
eltra
after
the
--
in
connection
with
the
acquisition,
a
company
which
is
now
an
effective
competitor
in
the
private
brand
market
and
the
fact
that
champion
having
lost
a
portion
of
its
interest
and
its
sales
in
the
aftermarket
has
had
to
become
a
more
effective
and
competitor
in
the
private
brand
market.
all,
i
submit
are
contributions
to
competition
and
so
we
submit
that
it
was
a
pro-competitive
acquisition.
now
the
court
below,
as
i
have
suggested,
regarded
the
fact
that
although
ford
was
not
a
potential
entrant,
it
still
moderated
champion’s
price
and
also
the
fact
that
the
acquisition
somehow
foreclosed
competition
and
perhaps
also
increased
barriers
to
entry
as
a
ground
upon
which
it
decided
the
section
7
case
adversely
to
ford.
now,
as
i
have
said,
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
of
moderation
of
champions’
prices.
there
is
no
foreclosure
of
anybody,
but
champion,
and
champion
has
had
to
simply
get
out
and
compete
in
a
different
way.
this
is
not
a
case
like
brown
shoe
where
there
were
sales
being
made
by
competitors
in
the
market
and
such
sales
would
have
gone
on,
but
for
the
acquisition.
it
is
not
a
case
like
many
of
your
cases
on
potential
competition
where
a
potential
competitor
was
acquired
and
absorbed
and
there
was
no
substitute
as
there
was
here
for
the
absorption.
here,
the
acquisition
gave
rise
to
a
stronger
competitor
and
as
far
as
barriers
to
entry
is
concerned,
i
hope
i
have
made
clear
that
any
company
seeking
to
go
into
the
making
of
spark
plugs
for
use
in
automobiles
had
to
face
the
barriers
to
entry
which
were
inherent
in
the
business,
that
is
they
had
to
sell
at
low
price,
at
a
loss,
they
had
to
make
up
that
loss
over
a
period
of
years
through
the
replacement
market.
they
could
not
get
into
the
replacement
market
for
a
five
to
eight
years.
they
had
to
workout
all
kinds
of
technical
difficulties
in
arriving
at
the
thing,
so
that
really,
the
idea
that
little
companies
were
in
a
position
that
come
knocking
on
the
door
and
get
the
business
is
just
a
concept
of
unnecessary
charade.
it
would
just
be
a
charade
to
suggest
that
the
small
manufacturers
were
in
a
position
to
come
in
and
get
that
business.
now
champion,
if
this
transaction
had
not
taken
place,
it
seems
clear
on
this
record
that
what
would
have
happened
would
be,
the
champion
would
have
continued
as
it
had
for
50
years
to
be
ford’s
supplier
and
the
market
would
have
been
just
what
it
was
before.
instead
of
that,
the
market
has
become
more
competitive
as
a
result
of
ford’s
activity
in
it
and
the
creation
of
eltra
as
a
real
competitor
and
the
fact
that
champion
has
to
scramble
out
for
business
by
competing
in
the
private
brand
market,
all
are
contributions
to
competition.
the
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
no,
as
far
as
i
know.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
oh
well,
i
beg
your
pardon,
yes
sir.
in
connection
with
the
sale,
ford
undertook
to
buy
$12
million
for
two
years.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
so
those
may
have
well
have
been
used
for
original
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
they
might
well
have
been
used
for
that
purpose.
now,
i
must
come
to
the
problem
of
relief.
let
me
just,
before
i
come
to
that,
i
really
think
that
the
government’s
position
and
the
court’s
position
here
was
without
any
kind
of
sub
silentio
treatment
that
ford
being
a
large
customer
must
as
a
matter
of
law
be
regarded
as
having
somehow
moderated
without
regard
to
the
facts
and
thus
that
any
acquisition
involving
such
a
large
customer
must
be
regarded
as
per
se
illegal.
the
court
does
not
use
those
words,
but
i
think
that
is
the
necessary
implication
and
i
submit
that
they
are
quite
enough
per
se
rules
now
without
having
one
in
this
field
and
further
more
it
would
be
very
unsound
indeed
to
treat
a
customer
in
the
same
position
as
one
as
your
honor
said
in
penn-olin,
waiting
anxiously
on
the
edge
of
the
market
to
come
in
now
on
relief.
if
i
have
satisfied
your
honors
that
there
is
no
violation,
that
is
the
end
of
the
case.
if
your
honors
think,
as
far
as
we
are
concerned,
if
your
honors
think
that
there
was
a
violation,
we
submit
that
divestiture
in
this
case
was
an
improper
remedy.
we
know
that
divestiture
is
usually
the
remedy,
but
your
honors
have
laid
it
down
that
it
is
not
an
execrably
the
remedy
and
here
the
effect
of
divestiture
as
we
shown
in
our
brief
would
have
been
one
or
two
things.
either
after
all
the
effort
involved
in
divestiture,
all
that
would
have
happened
would
have
been
that
the
new
fostoria,
the
purchaser
would
have
become
tied
before
just
as
the
old
company
had,
just
as
champion
had
been
the
market
would
have
been
just
as
it
was
before
and
all
the
advantages,
the
pro-competitive
advantage
of
this
acquisition
would
have
been
lost
and
the
alternative
to
that
which
is
perhaps
still
worse
is
that
after
the
five
years
during
which
ford
had
to
take
half
of
its
requirements
from
new
fostoria,
the
company
would
not
have
been
able
to
market.
somehow
it
would
have
lost
its
markets
and
it
would
have
failed
and
then
the
whole
thing
would
have
gone
for
naught,
a
great
economic
loss
to
the
public.
now,
let
me
leave
that.
ford
made
a
proposal
which
i
think
really
was
in
this
setting
far
more
fruitful
than
divestiture
and
that
was
that
for
10
years,
it
should
buy
30
million
plugs
from
eltra.
eltra
then
had
the
capacity
of
about
20
million
plugs.
annual
purchases
of
30
million
would
have
put
eltra
in
the
position
to
sell
50
or
more
million
a
year
and
made
it
an
effective
competitor
and
that
relief
in
lieu
of
divestiture
would
have
done
more
to
improve
the
competitive
situation
than
divestiture
would
have
done.
let
me
come
to
the
injunctions
because
these
are
things
which
i
have
a
deep
concern
and
i
have
not
left
myself
any
time
to
talk
about
it.
the
injunction
which
the
court
granted,
forbidding
ford
by
internal
entry
to
go
into
manufacture
for
10
years
is
absolutely
unprecedented
as
far
as
i
know.
it
is
clearly
anticompetitive.
its
effect
would
be
to
deprive
ford
of
a
right
that
everybody
else
has.
the
general
motors
had
an
exercise
and
there
is
absolutely
no
reason
except
some
back-handed
penalty
or
any
such
harsh
injunction.
my
learned
friend
says,
well,
it
would
take
ford
awhile
to
get
into
the
business
and
it
was
trying
to
go
into
the
business
anyhow,
that
does
not
take
away
i
think
from
the
error
in
the
court
below
in
granting
such
a
sweeping,
unprecedented
and
unjustified
injunction
and
in
the
same
category
is
the
injunction
against
ford
using
its
own
name
after
four
or
five
years.
that
means
that
ford
would
have
to
buy
not
only
half
its
plugs
from
eltra
or
from
new
fostoria,
but
would
have
to
buy
the
rest
of
its
plugs
from
somebody
else
under
that
person’s
trade
name
and
not
use
the
ford
name.
so
that
ford
would
be
forbidden
from
really
beginning
to
edge
into
this
market
under
its
own
name
for
a
long
period
of
time.
there
is
no
precedent
for
any
such
relief
as
that.
it
is
unnecessary
and
clearly
anticompetitive.
now,
i
will
not
argue
with
the
requirements
contract
which
is
the
third
injunction
because
in
my
own
view
if
divestiture
was
proper
or
if
there
was
a
violation
in
divestiture
and
it
was
proper,
that
injunction
may
have
been
useful
in
implementing
the
divestiture
and
ensuring
the
divested
company
of
business
for
a
period
of
time
and
while
it
is
unusual
and
i
think
unnecessary,
i
will
not
press
that.
but
it
seems
to
me,
the
other
two
injunctions
whatever
your
honor
does
--
whatever
your
honors
do
with
divestiture
and
violation
are
clearly
erroneous
and
the
decree
should
be
reversed
on
that
ground
alone,
but
our
view
is
that
it
should
be
reversed
across
the
board.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
i
would
just
take
a
moment
or
two
in
the
colloquy
that
developed
the
basic
question.
did
this
acquisition
substantially
lessen
competition
or
have
the
probability
of
doing
so
and
i
submit
that
it
is
amply
clear
that
not
only
did
it
not
lessen
the
competition
or
eliminate
any
competitor,
it
added
competition.
it
aided
competition.
it
promoted
competition
and
what
mr.
friedman
has
told
your
honors,
points
that
up.
chrysler
and
champion
are
in
a
more
competitive
relationship
than
when
champion
did
not
have
these
grounds
for
business.
champion
is
also
in
the
aftermarket,
in
the
private
brand
market.
eltra
which
is
the
fourth
company
in
the
business
and
if
this
divestiture
took
place,
there
would
still
only
be
four.
there
would
not
be
a
new
company
because
new
fostoria
would
just
take
the
place
of
ford
as
a
supplier,
but
the
result
of
this
acquisition
was
to
create
a
fourth
competitor
and
that
is
eltra
which
is
active
in
the
private
brand
market
where
it
is
competing
actively
with
champion,
still
the
biggest
company
in
the
business
or
having
the
largest
franchise
of
that
kind
of
business,
and
eltra
sales
and
in
the
last
figures
in
the
record
for
17
million
plugs.
now,
that
is
not
very
much
compared
with
the
sales
of
general
motors
and
others,
but
it
is
coming
up.
eltra’s
president
testified
that
he
expected
the
market
by
1980
to
be
around
150
million
plugs.
this
is
a
contribution
to
competition
now.
now,
let
me
explain
the
way
this
private
brand
market
works
as
i
understand
it
in
connection
with
automobiles.
the
mass
merchandisers
have
put
in
repair
bases
in
many
of
their
retail
outlets
in
suburbs
and
so
on
and
you
come
in
to
shop
at
sears
roebuck,
you
pull
your
car
in
there
and
get
them
to
tune
it
up
and
unless
you
tell
them,
that
what
you
want
is
an
ac
plug,
what
they
do
is
to
put
on
a
series
plug
and
so
this
business
of
overcoming
the
oe
tie
by
direction
of
the
guy
that
runs
the
station
is
what
happens
in
connection
with
these
private
brand
sales
and
apparently
it
is
having
a
monopoly
scale
so
it
is
getting
to
be
a
more
significant
part
of
the
market.
now,
i
submit
that
this
was
a
pro-competitive
activity.
if
that
so,
that
ends
the
case
and
the
judge
had
to
struggle
so
hard
to
get
away
from
the
inference
and
i
must
say
it
was
clear
in
1969
and
it
was
when
the
government
brought
the
suit.
in
1961,
it
may
have
looked
less
pro-competitive
than
it
turned
out
to
be,
but
the
judge
had
or
really
take
this
concept
of
being
on
the
edge
of
the
market,
but
he
transposed
the
notion
of
being
on
the
edge
of
the
market
from
your
potential
completion
decisions
to
a
mere
customer
status
where
i
submit
it
does
not
have
any
place
or
customer
is
always
on
the
edge
of
the
market,
but
it
is
not
on
the
edge
of
the
market
as
one
anxiously
waiting
to
come
in
which
is
what
your
case
deals
with.
my
learned
friend
said
that
champion
was
--
might
have
lost
the
business
before
nibbling
at
it,
but
champion
showed
no
signs
of
concern
in
the
testimony,
including
the
testimony
quoted
in
our
reply
brief
shows
that
champion
was
not
worried
about
it.
it
felt
that
it
would
go
on
forever.
that
is
the
way
it
had
been
and
chrysler
had
some
inquiries,
but
nobody
ever
made
a
bid
to
chrysler
and
so
when
you
talk
about
it,
when
the
judge
talks
about
the
terrible
thing
being
in
the
denial
of
the
opportunity
to
try,
this
is
really
test
as
i
said
before
a
charade.
it
is
not
a
real
effort
and
it
is
really
not
open
to
people
to
come
in
and
make
the
sacrifice
involved
and
selling
below
cost
and
waiting
eight
years
to
draw
out
the
market.
now
finally,
the
--
it
is
clear
from
counsel’s
argument
i
think
and
i
think
from
the
opinion
on
relief
that
the
court
below
really
was
concerned
about
the
oe
tie
and
was
trying
to
find
a
way
to
break
it
and
he
thought
that
it
was
the
divestiture
in
holding
ford’s
head
underwater
with
these
injunctions
maybe
something
would
happen
to
break
the
tie.
but
quite
aside
from
the
fact
that
that
was
a
judicial
experiment
which
is
beyond
i
submit,
the
ordinary
activities
that
are
proper
under
the
statute.
there
is
no
prospect
of
breaking
it
that
way.
the
prospect
of
breaking
it
is
by
competition
and
competition
was
encouraged
by
this
transaction
and
thus
one
word
on
the
injunctions.
counsel
says
it
took
10
years
to
get
the
judgment
in
this
case,
and
therefore,
ford
should
be
banned
for
10
years
from
entering
the
market.
i
submit
that
that
does
not
follow
at
all
and
that
be
banned
at
all
from
entering
the
market
was
anticompetitive
and
there
is
no
basis
for
it
and
as
far
as
ford’s
name
is
concerned
to
deny
it
an
opportunity
to
even
lay
the
basis
for
ultimate
entry
in
the
market
for
many,
many
years
by
preventing
it
from
letting
its
name
be
connected
with
spark
plugs
made
by
others
is
quite
wrong.
and
aside
from
everything
else
those
injunctions
were
excessive
beyond
i
think
any
proper
exercise
of
the
court’s
discretion,
but
basically
my
view
is
that
this
was
a
pro-competitive
acquisition
and
the
judgment
should
be
reversed.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
going
to
try
to
reserve
a
few
minutes
for
reply.
this
is
a
direct
appeal
from
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
in
detroit
holding
that
the
acquisition
in
1961
by
ford
motor
company
of
the
spark
plug
business
and
the
name
of
the
autolite
company
to
enable
ford
to
supply
its
own
needs
for
original
installation
of
spark
plugs
and
also
to
supply
replacement
plugs
to
others
and
the
acquisition
occurred
after
ford
had
been
the
customer
of
champion,
a
leading
company
in
the
business
for
50
years.
the
court
held
that
the
acquisition
violated
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
he
directed
divestiture
and
then
ended
seven
other
extraordinary
injunctions.
first,
he
enjoined
ford
from
going
into
the
business
of
making
spark
plugs
by
internal
entry
for
10
years.
the
judgment
enjoined
ford
from
making
any
plugs
under
its
own
name
for
five
years,
not
marketing
any
plugs
under
its
own
name
for
five
years
and
required
ford
to
buy
half
its
requirements
for
five
years
from
the
purchaser
of
the
divested
--
the
portion
divested.
when
the
case
was
tried,
batteries
were
also
involved,
but
they
dropped
out
and
they
are
not
now
involved,
that
matter
having
been
satisfactory
disposed
of.
ford
challenges
the
decision
of
the
district
court
as
to
the
violation
and
submits
that
even
if
there
was
a
violation,
divestiture
in
this
case
was
not
the
best
remedy
because
other
remedies
which
i
will
mention
were
better
and
challenges
all
the
extraordinary
injunctions
with
particular
weight
on
the
injunction
against
the
internal
entry
and
the
injunction
against
the
use
of
the
ford
name
which
it
regards
as
definitely
anticompetitive.
now,
i
think
it
is
important
to
understand
the
nature
of
this
industry
because
as
in
other
cases,
the
impact
of
section
7
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
industry
in
a
particular
situation
involved.
general
motors
has
made
its
own
spark
plugs
since
1909.
in
that
year,
it
acquired
the
then
champion
spark
plug
business
and
had
since
marketed
its
spark
plug
under
the
name
of
ac,
under
the
letters
ac
and
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition,
general
motors
had
30%
of
the
spark
plug
market.
when
i
say
the
spark
plug
market,
i
am
talking
for
the
most
part
about
the,
not
the
original
installations
but
the
market,
in
the
so-called
after-market,
the
replacement
plugs,
that
is
where
the
large
amount
of
the
plug
business
is
done.
champion
went
back
into
the
spark
plug
business
after
selling
to
general
motors
and
has
supplied
or
had
at
the
time
of
that
acquisition,
supplied
ford
for
50
years.
and
in
1936,
autolite
came
into
the
business
and
began
to
supply
chrysler
and
champion
got
50%
of
the
business,
it
had
50%
of
the
business
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition,
that
is
general
motors
30,
champion
50,
and
autolite
about
15,
and
the
balance
of
few
percent
was
sort
of
--
were
spread
among
small
manufactures
mostly
in
the
private
brand
market.
now,
the
private
brand
market
is
the
market
served
by
such
companies
as
sears,
roebuck,
and
montgomery
ward
and
other
mass
merchandisers
and
some
of
the
oil
companies
who
market
spark
plugs
under
their
own
trade
names.
in
1960
to
1961,
in
those
years,
chrysler
got
very
concerned,
i
mean,
autolite
got
very
concerned
because
it
saw
signs
that
chrysler
might
be
getting
ready
to
go
into
the
spark
plug
business
itself
and
that
might
leave
it
with
an
expensive
plant
which
the
court
described,
below
described
as
a
potential
albatross
if
it
could
not
do
something
about
it.
and
so
it
came
to
ford
and
offered
to
sell
the
spark
plug
business
to
ford
and
the
autolite
name
for
spark
plugs
and
other
uses.
and
they
worked
out
a
deal
under
which
ford
brought
this
assets
including
the
battery
assets
which
are
no
longer
involved
for
a
total
of
$28
million
and
autolite
became
eltra.
so
that
there
was
a
new
company
with
a
name
of
eltra
created
which
carried
on
the
portion
of
the
business
not
sold
by
autolite
to
ford
and
eltra
has
built
a
spark
plug
plant
in
alabama
and
is
in
the
business
of
supplying
spark
plugs
largely
for
the
private
brand
market.
ford,
in
connection
with
the
sale
agreed
to
buy
12
million
plugs
from
eltra
over
a
period
of
two
years
and
also
to
provide
it
with
certain
ceramic
parts
and
thereupon
ford
was
in
the
business
under
the
autolite
name.
champion
became
chrysler’s
supplier
and
took
part
of
--
a
large
part
of
the
year
to
change
over
from
champion
plugs
to
autolite
plugs
and
worked
out
the
technical
difficulties
involved
and
also
to
begin
the
process
of
improving
the
distribution
systems
and
it
took
about
the
same
for
chrysler
to
get
started
with
its
new
supplier,
champion.
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition
or
just
before
the
acquisition,
ford
had
some
14%
of
the
spark
plug
business
and
after
the
acquisition,
ford's
percentage
gradually
came
up
and
champion’s
went
down
and
general
motor’s
remained
about
the
same,
although
it
has
gone
up
a
little
bit.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
the
champion
figure
originally
was
50%
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes,
1960-1961,
just
before
the
acquisition
and
ford’s
was
30
and
autolite
was
about
15.
and
when
ford
came
in,
the
autolite
business
began
to
go
up
so
that
by
--
about
19
--
in
the
late
1960s,
ford’s
business
was
up
to
about
19%
and
champion’s
business
had
come
down
from
50
to
about
40
and
general
motors
had
remained
about
the
same,
perhaps
gone
up
a
little
bit.
it
is
not
correct
as
the
government
suggests
that
this
was
all
automatic,
that
all
happened
was
that
the
champions
business
went
down
and
the
autolite
business
went
up
and
chrysler
was
changing
suppliers.
there
was
active
and
intense
competition
in
the
after-market
and
it
was
a
result
of
that
competition
that
these
changes
and
percentages
took
place
through,
it
seemed
like
relatively
small
changes
in
percentage
but
each
percentage
point
was
about
4
million
plugs
and
it
is
a
substantial
amount
of
business
where
involving
thousands
and
thousands
of
transactions.
the
--
i
think
your
honors
will
be
satisfied
when
i
finish
describing
the
industry
that
historically
there
have
been,
since
1936,
only
three
major
suppliers
to
the
automobile
companies
and
that
before
that,
there
were
only
two
and
that
the
business
does
not
accommodate
itself
to
more
than
three
major
suppliers.
there
is
this
private
market
business,
but
inevidently
there
are
in
this
business
i
think
there
is
room
only
for
three
major
suppliers
and
that
is
because
of
the
special
nature
of
the
plug
in
the
business
which
are
not
joined
to.
without
going
into
any
detail
of
the
mechanics,
the
spark
plug
is
a
small
but
essential
part
of
an
automobile
and
the
truck
and
also
used
in
tractors
and
long-horse
and
so
on.
it
has,
as
you
know
two
electrodes.
it
is
inserted
in
the
cylinder
to
jump
a
spark
caused
by
power
from
the
generator
to
ignite
the
mixture
of
oil
and
gasoline
and
air
in
the
cylinder
and
cause
the
explosion
which
drives
the
engine.
the
plugs
are
carefully
engineered
to
particular
mix
and
models.
it
takes
the
plug
manufacturers
and
the
automobile
manufacturers
work
closely
together
over
a
long
period
of
time
to
get
just
the
right
form
and
construction
of
the
plug
and
to
make
it
deal
most
effectively
with
the
particular
model
for
which
it
is
used.
just
as
an
example,
i
think
ford
now
makes
some
80
different
motors
and
has
80
different
plugs
for
those
motors.
the
use
of
the
wrong
plug
can
cause
malfunctioning,
affect
the
exhaust
fumes
from
the
engine
and
could
cause
serious
damage.
now,
the
plugs
are
installed
at
the
factory
in
what
is
called
oe
installation,
that
is
original
equipment
installation
and
the
automobile
manufacturer
buys
or
makes
these
plugs
and
they
are
put
in
the
car
and
then
the
car
is
sold
and
about
18
months
after
the
car
is
sold,
the
average
kind
of
owner
goes
around
and
gets
a
tune
up
and
has
a
replacement
of
the
plugs.
and
the
plugs
are
replaced
about
five
times
during
the
use
of
the
average
automobile
and
that
means
that
on
a
six-cylinder
car,
there
are
30
plugs
that
are
bought
over
that
period,
on
eight-cylinder
40
plugs.
the
facts
i
am
stating
i
think
there
is
no
dispute
about
--
were
at
one
about,
think
the
nature
of
the
market
and
the
facts
about
the
market
and
indeed
many
of
them
are
stipulated.
most
replacement
plugs
are
inserted
by
mechanics
in
the
course
of
a
tune-up.
one
does
not
ordinarily
take
his
car
around
and
says,
i
need
a
new
spark
plug,
but
usually
he
is
going
to
a
garage
or
a
service
station
or
some
other
place
to
have
the
car
tuned-up
and
gone
over
and
at
that
time
that
the
mechanic
ordinarily
inserts
the
new
plugs.
and
the
new
plugs
are
such
a
minor
part
of
the
cost
of
that
operation
that
really
price
and
cost
of
the
plugs
to
the
customer
are
no
moment
so
that
there
is
little
if
any
price
competition
at
that
level.
the
mechanic
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
that
is
right.
the
mechanic
on
the
basis
of
his
experience
and
knowledge
ordinarily
makes
the
choice.
now,
he
chooses
the
plug
which
ordinarily,
the
plug
which
was
originally
installed.
this
propensity
of
mechanics
to
use
the
plug
originally
installed
is
called
in
this
record
sometimes
the
oe
type
which
merely
means
the
propensity
of
mechanics
to
use
the
same
plug
in
replacement
that
was
there
originally
and
he
does
this
because
he
knows
about
the
fact
that
the
plug
was
originally
designed
for
that
car
and
he
does
not
want
to
take
into
risk
about
it.
he
does
not
want
to
think
that
he
is
smarter
than
the
engineering
department
that
designed
it.
now,
there
are
all
purpose
plugs
manufactured
by
all
of
these
companies
and
the
average
garage
man
or
service
station
man
stocks
some
of
the
plugs,
but
usually
not
all
the
plugs.
usually,
if
the
record
shows
that
sometimes
the
garage
owner
or
the
filling
station
owner
has
only
the
ac
plug
or
sometimes
the
champion
plug,
but
usually
both
of
those
because
they
are
so
popular
and
then
at
the
time
of
this
acquisition,
probably
few
of
these
places
also
stock
the
autolite
plugs
and
one
of
the
great
efforts
here
in
the
competitive
struggle
has
been
to
get
more
and
more
of
these
places
to
stock
the
autolite
plug.
if
they
do
not
have
the
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
that
is
right.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
that
is
right.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
after
1936.
before
1936,
general
motors
had
supplied
chrysler.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
that
is
right.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well,
generally
speaking
there
are
perhaps
two
reasons
as
far
as
the
autolite
plug
and
the
ford
champion
plug
to
take
that
first.
ford,
tried
to
distribute
these
plugs
through
its
franchise
dealers
and
the
franchise
dealers
were
no
longer
handling
at
or
about
the
time
of
the
acquisition
as
many
of
the
installations
as
the
filling
stations
and
others.
and
the
filling
station
proprietors
and
the
garage
proprietors
were
concerned
about
not
having
too
large
an
inventory
and
actually
they
would
maintain
an
inventory
which
would
do
the
best
job
in
supplying
plugs
for
the
largest
possible
number
without
too
much
of
an
investment.
so
there
was
a
tendency
to
have
a
major
lines
and
the
autolite
line
had
difficulty
getting
in
as
indicated
by
the
fact
that
between
about
the
time
of
the
acquisition
in
the
late
1960s,
the
percentage
of
ford
sales
in
the
aftermarket
crept
up
some
5%
which
i
think
is
represented
by
the
increase
stocking
of
these
plugs
in
the
market.
now,
the
--
i
mentioned
the
all
purpose
plug,
all
these
companies
make
all
purpose
plugs
so
that
if
the
mechanic
does
not
have
the
oe
plug
at
the
time,
he
can
try
to
do
the
best
he
can
by
using
an
all
purpose
plug
which
is
a
sort
of
a
compromise.
it
is
not
as
good
as
many
people
think
as
the
oe
plug,
but
it
is
better
than
a
plug
that
was
made
for
a
wholly
different
kind
of
a
car
and
that
is
a
kind
of
compromise
solution.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
that
was
so
for
a
long
time
and
the
business
are
trying
to
get
them
to
carry
three
took
a
lot
of
effort
and
that
is
what
went
off.
now,
the
oe
use
is
of
such
importance
to
the
manufacturer
that
champion,
beginning
in
1920,
started
what
is
now
as
the
six
cent
oe
price,
it
began
to
sell
the
plugs
for
original
installation
at
6
cents
and
then
everybody
--
all
the
manufacturers
followed
soon
so
that
all
the
plugs
were
original
equipment
installation
were
sold
at
6
cents
and
the
cost
of
the
plugs
was
three
or
four
times
as
much
as
that.
so
that
the
manufacturer
used
this
low
oe
price
to
get
in
and
get
the
business
and
then
he
had
to
make
up
for
the
loss
on
that
sale
by
a
higher
price
on
the
sales
for
the
aftermarket,
the
replacement
plugs.
and
so
this
is
a
very
important
part
of
the
getting
into
the
business
and
holding
the
business
and
is
a
fact
of
life
which
is
unusual
in
this
industry
i
think.
the
--
i
have
already
mentioned
the
fact
that
because
of
the
fact
that
the
plugs
are
originally
installed
as
part
of
other
work,
that
their
prices
of
little
or
no
moment
and
this
and
one
of
the
reasons
of
the
price
in
the
business
has
been
so
stable
is
that
in
1953,
all
of
the
plug
manufacturers
had
cases
before
the
federal
trade
commission
which
involved
the
question
of
whether
they
could
distinguish
in
price
between
the
various
types
of
distributors
who
distributed
their
plugs
including
the
other
companies
who
wanted
to
distribute
their
plugs
and
the
federal
trade
commission
held
that
they
had
to
give
the
same
price
to
everybody
in
the
distribution
chain
and
this
has
naturally
kept
the
plug
manufacturers
from
lowering
their
price
because
if
they
did,
they
had
to
do
it
to
everybody
and
therefore
they
could
not
do
it
in
the
ordinary
competitive
way.
the
court
below
regarded
one
of
the
important
factors
as
to
whether
or
not
the
champion
or
the
ford’s
relation
to
champion
tended
to
moderate
champion’s
price
and
he
held
that
it
did
and
it
was
his
view
that
somehow
ford
being
a
large
customer
of
champion,
moderated
champion’s
price.
now,
on
this
record
that
is
just
a
theory.
there
was
no
proof
and
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
show
that
there
was
any
such
moderation.
i
would
take
it
that
the
original
equipment
price
given
50
years
ago
is
hardly
a
moderation
which
should
still
persist
in
any
realistic
sense
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition.
it
was
really
not
a
moderation
that
was
a
sort
of
a
payment
for
entrance
or
an
arrangement
for
entrance
and
aside
from
that
the
record
does
not
show
any
moderation.
ford
had
to
pay
a
higher
price
in
1959
and
1960
for
its
plugs
than
other
people
did
and
there
is
not
any
evidence
of
moderation.
the
suggestion
is
made
that
the
court
examined
this
carefully
that
ford
was
a
potential
competitor
and
that
under
penn-olin,
somehow
this
acquisition
was
bad.
now,
the
court
took
testimony
and
the
government
tried
very
hard
to
try
to
show
that
ford
was
on
the
verge
of
entering
this
business,
but
the
evidence
the
court
found
did
not
show
that
ford
was
on
the
brink
of
entering
this
business.
there
are
certain
memoranda
in
the
record
which
indicate
that
there
was
a
study
made
to
that
subject,
several
studies
but
they
never
reached
the
point
of
top
level
consideration
and
the
reason
they
did
not
was
that,
and
the
testimony
of
mr.
duffy
in
the
record
which
the
court
accepted,
was
that
plugs
were
available
to
ford
for
oe
installation
at
one-third
of
cost.
ford
did
not
have
at
that
time
any
engineers
who
were
expert
in
the
plug
business
or
even
in
the
ceramic
business
that
they
had
no
distribution
system
which
was
adequate
at
that
time
to
enable
them
to
compete
effectively
in
the
aftermarket
and
then
the
undisputed
evidence
is
and
the
court
recognized
it
and
everybody
recognized
it,
that
after
an
original
oe
installation
of
a
new
plug,
it
takes
five
to
eight
years
to
have
enough
vehicles
on
the
road
with
that
plug
in
them
to
really
do
a
lot
of
business
in
the
aftermarket.
and
so
anybody
going
into
the
plug
business
has
a
major
manufacturer
had
to
face
all
these
difficulties,
the
problem
of
five
to
eight
years
before
he
can
really
realize
on
the
aftermarket.
the
problem
of
the
loss
which
was
involved
in
connection
with
getting
--
having
something
other
than
the
six-cent
price,
the
problem
of
working
out
to
technicalities
and
so
on.
so,
it
is
clear
i
think
that
ford
was
not
a
potential
competitor
and
the
court
did
not
conclude
that
it
was.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
no,
i
believe
and
in
fact
i
believe
they
are
manufactured
by
general
motors
at
one
of
its
divisions.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes,
yes.
at
the
time
ford,
went
in
the
business,
at
the
time
ford
made
the
acquisitions.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
now,
i
want
to
move
along,
i
have
spent
more
time
over
the
industry
than
i
intended
to.
the
court
pointed
out
i
think
that
ford
considered
that
making
this
acquisition
would
enable
it
to
get
into
the
business
and
compete
effectively
and
that
expectation
was
real
honest
because
of
the
competition
has
increased
since
ford
made
this
acquisition
and
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
it
was
not
just
a
slipping
around
of
percentages,
but
it
was
a
genuine
increase
in
competition
in
the
market.
this
acquisition
we
submit
was
pro-competitive
because
it
made
ford
a
--
ford
was
a
stronger
and
more
effective
competitor
than
autolite
had
been,
where
there
were
three
companies
before
the
acquisition,
the
creation
of
eltra
after
the
--
in
connection
with
the
acquisition,
a
company
which
is
now
an
effective
competitor
in
the
private
brand
market
and
the
fact
that
champion
having
lost
a
portion
of
its
interest
and
its
sales
in
the
aftermarket
has
had
to
become
a
more
effective
and
competitor
in
the
private
brand
market.
all,
i
submit
are
contributions
to
competition
and
so
we
submit
that
it
was
a
pro-competitive
acquisition.
now
the
court
below,
as
i
have
suggested,
regarded
the
fact
that
although
ford
was
not
a
potential
entrant,
it
still
moderated
champion’s
price
and
also
the
fact
that
the
acquisition
somehow
foreclosed
competition
and
perhaps
also
increased
barriers
to
entry
as
a
ground
upon
which
it
decided
the
section
7
case
adversely
to
ford.
now,
as
i
have
said,
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
of
moderation
of
champions’
prices.
there
is
no
foreclosure
of
anybody,
but
champion,
and
champion
has
had
to
simply
get
out
and
compete
in
a
different
way.
this
is
not
a
case
like
brown
shoe
where
there
were
sales
being
made
by
competitors
in
the
market
and
such
sales
would
have
gone
on,
but
for
the
acquisition.
it
is
not
a
case
like
many
of
your
cases
on
potential
competition
where
a
potential
competitor
was
acquired
and
absorbed
and
there
was
no
substitute
as
there
was
here
for
the
absorption.
here,
the
acquisition
gave
rise
to
a
stronger
competitor
and
as
far
as
barriers
to
entry
is
concerned,
i
hope
i
have
made
clear
that
any
company
seeking
to
go
into
the
making
of
spark
plugs
for
use
in
automobiles
had
to
face
the
barriers
to
entry
which
were
inherent
in
the
business,
that
is
they
had
to
sell
at
low
price,
at
a
loss,
they
had
to
make
up
that
loss
over
a
period
of
years
through
the
replacement
market.
they
could
not
get
into
the
replacement
market
for
a
five
to
eight
years.
they
had
to
workout
all
kinds
of
technical
difficulties
in
arriving
at
the
thing,
so
that
really,
the
idea
that
little
companies
were
in
a
position
that
come
knocking
on
the
door
and
get
the
business
is
just
a
concept
of
unnecessary
charade.
it
would
just
be
a
charade
to
suggest
that
the
small
manufacturers
were
in
a
position
to
come
in
and
get
that
business.
now
champion,
if
this
transaction
had
not
taken
place,
it
seems
clear
on
this
record
that
what
would
have
happened
would
be,
the
champion
would
have
continued
as
it
had
for
50
years
to
be
ford’s
supplier
and
the
market
would
have
been
just
what
it
was
before.
instead
of
that,
the
market
has
become
more
competitive
as
a
result
of
ford’s
activity
in
it
and
the
creation
of
eltra
as
a
real
competitor
and
the
fact
that
champion
has
to
scramble
out
for
business
by
competing
in
the
private
brand
market,
all
are
contributions
to
competition.
the
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
no,
as
far
as
i
know.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
oh
well,
i
beg
your
pardon,
yes
sir.
in
connection
with
the
sale,
ford
undertook
to
buy
$12
million
for
two
years.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
so
those
may
have
well
have
been
used
for
original
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
they
might
well
have
been
used
for
that
purpose.
now,
i
must
come
to
the
problem
of
relief.
let
me
just,
before
i
come
to
that,
i
really
think
that
the
government’s
position
and
the
court’s
position
here
was
without
any
kind
of
sub
silentio
treatment
that
ford
being
a
large
customer
must
as
a
matter
of
law
be
regarded
as
having
somehow
moderated
without
regard
to
the
facts
and
thus
that
any
acquisition
involving
such
a
large
customer
must
be
regarded
as
per
se
illegal.
the
court
does
not
use
those
words,
but
i
think
that
is
the
necessary
implication
and
i
submit
that
they
are
quite
enough
per
se
rules
now
without
having
one
in
this
field
and
further
more
it
would
be
very
unsound
indeed
to
treat
a
customer
in
the
same
position
as
one
as
your
honor
said
in
penn-olin,
waiting
anxiously
on
the
edge
of
the
market
to
come
in
now
on
relief.
if
i
have
satisfied
your
honors
that
there
is
no
violation,
that
is
the
end
of
the
case.
if
your
honors
think,
as
far
as
we
are
concerned,
if
your
honors
think
that
there
was
a
violation,
we
submit
that
divestiture
in
this
case
was
an
improper
remedy.
we
know
that
divestiture
is
usually
the
remedy,
but
your
honors
have
laid
it
down
that
it
is
not
an
execrably
the
remedy
and
here
the
effect
of
divestiture
as
we
shown
in
our
brief
would
have
been
one
or
two
things.
either
after
all
the
effort
involved
in
divestiture,
all
that
would
have
happened
would
have
been
that
the
new
fostoria,
the
purchaser
would
have
become
tied
before
just
as
the
old
company
had,
just
as
champion
had
been
the
market
would
have
been
just
as
it
was
before
and
all
the
advantages,
the
pro-competitive
advantage
of
this
acquisition
would
have
been
lost
and
the
alternative
to
that
which
is
perhaps
still
worse
is
that
after
the
five
years
during
which
ford
had
to
take
half
of
its
requirements
from
new
fostoria,
the
company
would
not
have
been
able
to
market.
somehow
it
would
have
lost
its
markets
and
it
would
have
failed
and
then
the
whole
thing
would
have
gone
for
naught,
a
great
economic
loss
to
the
public.
now,
let
me
leave
that.
ford
made
a
proposal
which
i
think
really
was
in
this
setting
far
more
fruitful
than
divestiture
and
that
was
that
for
10
years,
it
should
buy
30
million
plugs
from
eltra.
eltra
then
had
the
capacity
of
about
20
million
plugs.
annual
purchases
of
30
million
would
have
put
eltra
in
the
position
to
sell
50
or
more
million
a
year
and
made
it
an
effective
competitor
and
that
relief
in
lieu
of
divestiture
would
have
done
more
to
improve
the
competitive
situation
than
divestiture
would
have
done.
let
me
come
to
the
injunctions
because
these
are
things
which
i
have
a
deep
concern
and
i
have
not
left
myself
any
time
to
talk
about
it.
the
injunction
which
the
court
granted,
forbidding
ford
by
internal
entry
to
go
into
manufacture
for
10
years
is
absolutely
unprecedented
as
far
as
i
know.
it
is
clearly
anticompetitive.
its
effect
would
be
to
deprive
ford
of
a
right
that
everybody
else
has.
the
general
motors
had
an
exercise
and
there
is
absolutely
no
reason
except
some
back-handed
penalty
or
any
such
harsh
injunction.
my
learned
friend
says,
well,
it
would
take
ford
awhile
to
get
into
the
business
and
it
was
trying
to
go
into
the
business
anyhow,
that
does
not
take
away
i
think
from
the
error
in
the
court
below
in
granting
such
a
sweeping,
unprecedented
and
unjustified
injunction
and
in
the
same
category
is
the
injunction
against
ford
using
its
own
name
after
four
or
five
years.
that
means
that
ford
would
have
to
buy
not
only
half
its
plugs
from
eltra
or
from
new
fostoria,
but
would
have
to
buy
the
rest
of
its
plugs
from
somebody
else
under
that
person’s
trade
name
and
not
use
the
ford
name.
so
that
ford
would
be
forbidden
from
really
beginning
to
edge
into
this
market
under
its
own
name
for
a
long
period
of
time.
there
is
no
precedent
for
any
such
relief
as
that.
it
is
unnecessary
and
clearly
anticompetitive.
now,
i
will
not
argue
with
the
requirements
contract
which
is
the
third
injunction
because
in
my
own
view
if
divestiture
was
proper
or
if
there
was
a
violation
in
divestiture
and
it
was
proper,
that
injunction
may
have
been
useful
in
implementing
the
divestiture
and
ensuring
the
divested
company
of
business
for
a
period
of
time
and
while
it
is
unusual
and
i
think
unnecessary,
i
will
not
press
that.
but
it
seems
to
me,
the
other
two
injunctions
whatever
your
honor
does
--
whatever
your
honors
do
with
divestiture
and
violation
are
clearly
erroneous
and
the
decree
should
be
reversed
on
that
ground
alone,
but
our
view
is
that
it
should
be
reversed
across
the
board.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
i
would
just
take
a
moment
or
two
in
the
colloquy
that
developed
the
basic
question.
did
this
acquisition
substantially
lessen
competition
or
have
the
probability
of
doing
so
and
i
submit
that
it
is
amply
clear
that
not
only
did
it
not
lessen
the
competition
or
eliminate
any
competitor,
it
added
competition.
it
aided
competition.
it
promoted
competition
and
what
mr.
friedman
has
told
your
honors,
points
that
up.
chrysler
and
champion
are
in
a
more
competitive
relationship
than
when
champion
did
not
have
these
grounds
for
business.
champion
is
also
in
the
aftermarket,
in
the
private
brand
market.
eltra
which
is
the
fourth
company
in
the
business
and
if
this
divestiture
took
place,
there
would
still
only
be
four.
there
would
not
be
a
new
company
because
new
fostoria
would
just
take
the
place
of
ford
as
a
supplier,
but
the
result
of
this
acquisition
was
to
create
a
fourth
competitor
and
that
is
eltra
which
is
active
in
the
private
brand
market
where
it
is
competing
actively
with
champion,
still
the
biggest
company
in
the
business
or
having
the
largest
franchise
of
that
kind
of
business,
and
eltra
sales
and
in
the
last
figures
in
the
record
for
17
million
plugs.
now,
that
is
not
very
much
compared
with
the
sales
of
general
motors
and
others,
but
it
is
coming
up.
eltra’s
president
testified
that
he
expected
the
market
by
1980
to
be
around
150
million
plugs.
this
is
a
contribution
to
competition
now.
now,
let
me
explain
the
way
this
private
brand
market
works
as
i
understand
it
in
connection
with
automobiles.
the
mass
merchandisers
have
put
in
repair
bases
in
many
of
their
retail
outlets
in
suburbs
and
so
on
and
you
come
in
to
shop
at
sears
roebuck,
you
pull
your
car
in
there
and
get
them
to
tune
it
up
and
unless
you
tell
them,
that
what
you
want
is
an
ac
plug,
what
they
do
is
to
put
on
a
series
plug
and
so
this
business
of
overcoming
the
oe
tie
by
direction
of
the
guy
that
runs
the
station
is
what
happens
in
connection
with
these
private
brand
sales
and
apparently
it
is
having
a
monopoly
scale
so
it
is
getting
to
be
a
more
significant
part
of
the
market.
now,
i
submit
that
this
was
a
pro-competitive
activity.
if
that
so,
that
ends
the
case
and
the
judge
had
to
struggle
so
hard
to
get
away
from
the
inference
and
i
must
say
it
was
clear
in
1969
and
it
was
when
the
government
brought
the
suit.
in
1961,
it
may
have
looked
less
pro-competitive
than
it
turned
out
to
be,
but
the
judge
had
or
really
take
this
concept
of
being
on
the
edge
of
the
market,
but
he
transposed
the
notion
of
being
on
the
edge
of
the
market
from
your
potential
completion
decisions
to
a
mere
customer
status
where
i
submit
it
does
not
have
any
place
or
customer
is
always
on
the
edge
of
the
market,
but
it
is
not
on
the
edge
of
the
market
as
one
anxiously
waiting
to
come
in
which
is
what
your
case
deals
with.
my
learned
friend
said
that
champion
was
--
might
have
lost
the
business
before
nibbling
at
it,
but
champion
showed
no
signs
of
concern
in
the
testimony,
including
the
testimony
quoted
in
our
reply
brief
shows
that
champion
was
not
worried
about
it.
it
felt
that
it
would
go
on
forever.
that
is
the
way
it
had
been
and
chrysler
had
some
inquiries,
but
nobody
ever
made
a
bid
to
chrysler
and
so
when
you
talk
about
it,
when
the
judge
talks
about
the
terrible
thing
being
in
the
denial
of
the
opportunity
to
try,
this
is
really
test
as
i
said
before
a
charade.
it
is
not
a
real
effort
and
it
is
really
not
open
to
people
to
come
in
and
make
the
sacrifice
involved
and
selling
below
cost
and
waiting
eight
years
to
draw
out
the
market.
now
finally,
the
--
it
is
clear
from
counsel’s
argument
i
think
and
i
think
from
the
opinion
on
relief
that
the
court
below
really
was
concerned
about
the
oe
tie
and
was
trying
to
find
a
way
to
break
it
and
he
thought
that
it
was
the
divestiture
in
holding
ford’s
head
underwater
with
these
injunctions
maybe
something
would
happen
to
break
the
tie.
but
quite
aside
from
the
fact
that
that
was
a
judicial
experiment
which
is
beyond
i
submit,
the
ordinary
activities
that
are
proper
under
the
statute.
there
is
no
prospect
of
breaking
it
that
way.
the
prospect
of
breaking
it
is
by
competition
and
competition
was
encouraged
by
this
transaction
and
thus
one
word
on
the
injunctions.
counsel
says
it
took
10
years
to
get
the
judgment
in
this
case,
and
therefore,
ford
should
be
banned
for
10
years
from
entering
the
market.
i
submit
that
that
does
not
follow
at
all
and
that
be
banned
at
all
from
entering
the
market
was
anticompetitive
and
there
is
no
basis
for
it
and
as
far
as
ford’s
name
is
concerned
to
deny
it
an
opportunity
to
even
lay
the
basis
for
ultimate
entry
in
the
market
for
many,
many
years
by
preventing
it
from
letting
its
name
be
connected
with
spark
plugs
made
by
others
is
quite
wrong.
and
aside
from
everything
else
those
injunctions
were
excessive
beyond
i
think
any
proper
exercise
of
the
court’s
discretion,
but
basically
my
view
is
that
this
was
a
pro-competitive
acquisition
and
the
judgment
should
be
reversed.
