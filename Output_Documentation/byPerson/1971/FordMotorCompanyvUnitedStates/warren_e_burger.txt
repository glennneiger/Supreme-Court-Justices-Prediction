mr.
seymour,
you

whenever
you
are
ready.
chief

e.

what
was
the
champion
figure?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
1961?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
i
read
somewhere
in
the
record
that
there
have
been
testimony
to
the
effect
that
most
of
the
filling
stations
did
not
appear
to
want
to
carry
more
than
two
different
brands?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
seymour.
mr.
friedman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
friedman,
do
you
agree
with
mr.
seymour
that
as
a
result
of
the
acquisition
in
1961,
the
giants
are
less
big
and
the
lesser
companies
are
bigger
and
have
a
greater
share
of
the
total
market?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
who
is
at
the
top
of
the
market
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
do
they
not
have
to
try
harder
as
a
result
of
this
to
hold
their
position?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
price
the
only
area
of
competition
or
--?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
friedman,
would
you
care
to
speculate
on
what
impact
this
will
have
on
champion
and
general
motors
if
any
or
is
there
not
anything
that
you
can
speculate
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
friedman,
before
you
leave
that,
who
was
it
who
was
speaking,
mr.
harry
davis
at
page
35,
identify
him
again
for
me?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
interested
in
what
he
said
a
few
lines
down
from
you
read
in
response
to
a
question,
he
said,
we
are
very
vulnerable
with
chrysler
in
speaking
of
the
relationship
with
new
relationship
with
chrysler.
i
mean,
we
do
not
dress
up
on
our
laurels
any
single
day
because
we
know
that
we
have
the
specter
with
prestolite
in
the
background
willing
to
battle
us
for
that
business
and
we
have
nothing
except
our
good
product
and
so
forth.
what
is
the
significance?
what
do
you
read
all
of
that
statement?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
that
mean
that
he
is
under
the
new
situation
they
have
try
harder?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
smaller
account.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
that
necessarily
so.
suppose,
hypothetically,
the
champion
now
came
up
with
the
plug
that
they
could
sell
for
3
cents,
would
that
not
give
them
possibility
of
getting
back
into
ford?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
who
buys
for
6
cents
when
they
can
buy
for
3
cents?
it
is
just,
that
is
a
very
strong
supposition,
but
i
was
testing
your
absolute
statement.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
sure
that
the
government
has
no
interest
in
trying
to
make
champion
bigger
or
make
its
position
more
secure,
has
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that
would
mean
with
the
champion
in
a
more
dominant
position
than
it
is
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
just
assuming
that
is
true,
are
you
suggesting
that
is
just
as
good
as
having
either
general
motors
for
itself
or
ford
or
chrysler
for
those
companies
to
make
and
completely
control
their
own
development
and
design
in
manufacture
and
research?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
friedman.
mr.
seymour.
chief

warren

you
