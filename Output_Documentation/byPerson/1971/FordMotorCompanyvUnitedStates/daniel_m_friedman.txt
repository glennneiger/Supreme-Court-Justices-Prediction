mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
section
7
of
the
clayton
act,
of
course
deals
with
the
probabilities
not
with
certainties.
the
statutory
standard
is
that
acquisitions
are
condemned
whose
effect
maybe,
maybe
substantially
to
less
the
composition
and
as
this
court
has
stated
and
as
the
legislative
history
indicates
all
that
is
required
is
that
there
be
a
reasonable
probability
of
anticompetitive
effect.
and
in
the
philadelphia
bank
opinion,
this
court
stated
that
a
determination
of
whether
there
is
such
a
reasonable
probability
of
anticompetitive
effect
as
it
said
requires
not
merely
an
appraisal
of
the
immediate
impact
of
the
merger
upon
competition,
but
a
prediction
of
its
impact
upon
competitive
conditions
in
the
future
and
also
added
that
a
prediction
as
to
the
future
impact
is
sound
only
if
it
is
based
upon
a
firm
understanding
of
the
structure
of
the
market.
that
is
the
impact
of
section
7
is
to
prevent
anticompetitive
changes
in
the
structure
of
the
market.
the
way
the
market
operates.
now,
there
is
no
question
about
the
market
in
this
case.
it
is
one
of
the
most
concentrated
markets
that
we
can
find.
for
more
than
20
years,
the
three
leading
firms
that
had
between
90
and
95%
of
the
market,
in
most
instances
closer
to
95
and
that
condition
is
continued
since
the
acquisition.
there
are
also
as
mr.
seymour
has
indicated
high
entry
barriers
in
this
market
primarily
because
of
the
fact
that
due
to
the
oe
tie,
a
manufacturer
finds
it
almost
impossible
to
get
into
the
lucrative
replacement
market
unless
he
has
the
oe
tie
and
you
cannot
get
the
oe
tie
unless
the
you
can
get
the
business
of
one
of
the
major
automobile
manufacturer.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
you
have
to
sell
way
below
cost.
so
what
you
have
is
this
is
a
market
where
there
is
a
high
concentration
and
very
high
barriers
to
entry
and
is
to
be
expected
in
such
a
market,
this
little
price
competition.
i
am
not
talking
now
of
the
price
competition
at
the
service
station
or
the
garage
level
where
you
go
to
have
your
motor
tuned.
i
am
talking
of
the
competition
at
the
next
level,
at
the
distributor
level,
at
the
warehouse
level
to
prices
at
which
the
manufacturers
and
the
distributors
of
spark
plugs
put
the
plugs
into
the
distribution
channel.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
do
not
agree
as
he
characterizes
it.
of
course
have
result
of
the
acquisition,
ford
now,
autolite
in
the
hands
of
ford
now
has
a
greater
share
of
the
market
than
autolite
had
before
the
acquisition,
but
of
course
what
has
happened
is
that
since
the
ford
account
was
a
much
larger
account
than
the
chrysler
account,
necessarily
when
autolite
shifted
its
custom
from
chrysler
to
ford,
it
necessary
got
a
larger
share
of
the
market
and
conversely
when
champion
after
it
had
lost
the
ford
account,
picked
up
the
chrysler
account,
it
had
a
smallest
share
of
the
market.
now,
we
are
not
saying
that
the
correspondence
is
automatic
but
we
think
this
reflects
a
major
share
of
the
shift
in
the
market,
but
we
do
not
think
the
market
is
anymore
competitive
mr.
chief
justice.
now,
we
had
an
economist
to
testify
on
this
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
even
after
the
shift,
there
has
been
no
basic
change
in
the
market.
the
market
is
still
all
oligopolistic.
the
market
is
still
the
big
three
at
95%.
there
is
still
virtually
no
price
competition
in
the
market.
this
new
competitor
that
has
been
referred
to
the
eltra
company,
the
eltra
company
as
the
district
court
characterizes
it
as
a
pygmy.
it
has
something
now,
even
now
something
like
1.4
or
1.6%
of
the
market.
it
has
its
own
name
brand
prestolite
which
is
made
very
little
progress
in
the
market.
it
is
basically
attempting
to
sell
in
the
aftermarket
through
the
private
brand
label
and
it
just
cannot
get
into
the
market
at
any
substantial
measure
because
of
the
original
equipment
tie.
we
do
not
conceive
that
the
market
is
anymore
competitive.
in
fact
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
still
champion.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
they
may
have
to
try
it.
they
may
have
to
try
harder.
they
may
have
to
sell
more
because
having
lost
the
ford
account,
they
may
find
it
necessary
to
fight
more
vigorously
for
business
in
the
aftermarket
but
nevertheless,
nevertheless,
all
there
has
been
is
a
slight
shifting
of
shares
among
the
firms
in
the
market
and
we
had
an
economist,
a
distinguished
economist
professor
mann
(ph)
who
testified
that
in
a
market
of
this
type,
in
a
market
of
this
type,
the
shifting
of
shares,
like
shifting
of
shares
among
the
three
leading
firms
that
together
have
95%
does
not
really
reflect
any
greater
vigor
of
competition
in
the
market.
there
is
no
price
competition.
this
is
not
injected
any
greater
price
competition
into
the
market.
there
is
no
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
price
is
not
the
only
area
of
competition
mr.
chief
justice,
but
one
of
the
characteristics
of
an
oligopolistic
market
is
the
absence
of
price
competition
and
price
competition
is
in
the
sense
the
ultimate
of
competition.
i
mean
that
is
what
is
really
all
about
is
prices
and
if
you
get
into
a
market
of
this
type
where
you
have
a
rigid
structure
and
i
might
mention
in
passing,
one
of
the
things
that
is
pointed
out
by
our
economist
and
one
of
the
things
that
the
record
shows
is
in
this
type
of
a
market
price
of
profit
is
very
high,
although
the
average
return
of
all
manufacturing
enterprises
in
the
country
is
10%
on
investment,
champion
over
15-year
period
had
an
average
of
25%.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
do
not
think
there
is
anything
mr.
justice
that
can
be
done
about
it
here
except
i
think
the
fact
that
gm
has
in
effect
tied
up
such
a
large
share
of
the
market
because
of
its
own
manufacturing
of
plugs
is
an
important
consideration
as
to
why
it
is
significant
and
vital
to
preserve
the
other
forces
in
the
market
that
tend
to
be
competitive.
now,
i
would
like
to
turn
this
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
may
be
mr.
justice,
on
the
other
hand
the
fact
that
general
motors
is
now
engaged
in
the
manufacture
of
its
own
spark
plugs
is
no
reason
why
ford
should
be
permitted
to
do
the
same
thing
whereas
we
believe
and
i
will
come
to
this
in
a
minute
now,
you
think
the
effect
of
ford’s
acquisition
of
the
autolite
company
and
going
into
the
manufacture
has
definite
and
are
competitive
consequence.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct
because
section
7
mr.
justice
speaks
of
acquisition.
any
firm
is
free
to
develop
it
internally.
that
is
exactly
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
under
this
decree
and
as
i
will
cover,
and
the
reason
for
that
mr.
justice
is
that
ford
is
this
prohibited
from
manufacturing
for
10
years
in
order
to
give
the
divested
company
the
opportunity
to
get
on
its
feet
again.
basically,
it
is
an
attempt,
four
to
ten
years
has
had
the
benefits
of
the
ownership
of
electric
autolite.
ford
has
acquired
in
this
ten-year
period
many
things.
it
has
developed
great
know-how.
it
has
built
up
a
staff
of
engineers.
it
acquired
autolite’s
entire
distribution
system,
it
is
entry
for
these
warehouse
distributors
who
are
so
important
and
penetrating
into
the
aftermarket
and
the
purpose
of
a
ten-year
provision
in
effect
is
to
put
the
thing
back,
put
the
thing
back
the
way
it
was
before
that
once
again
ford
to
be
a
customer,
there
will
be
a
large
independent
manufacturer
and
to
give
this
large
company
the
opportunity
to
begin
to
develop
because
if
i
may
just
say
one
other
thing
on
that
mr.
justice,
if
ford
were
permitted
to
go
into
manufacture
immediately,
the
likely
first
--
the
likely
thing
that
will
happen
would
be
this.
and
of
course,
i
mentioned
that
the
provisions
of
the
decree
are
all
interrelated
because
if
ford
were
permitted
to
go
into
manufacture
itself
and
there
was
no
ban
on
the
use
of
ford’s
name
or
even
with
the
present
thing,
what
probably
would
happen
is
ford
would
purchase
its
50%
requirements
from
divested
plant
and
put
those
plugs
into
the
aftermarket
to
sell
for
the
replacement
of
the
ford
plugs
that
are
ready
on
the
road
and
would
begin
manufacturing
under
its
own
name
and
selling
under
its
own
name
and
by
in
a
very
short
period,
after
five
or
six
years
when
the
market
for
the
replacement
plugs
was
exhausted,
this
new
company
would
find
itself
with
no
basis
at
all,
it
could
not
--
it
would
have
no
oe
tie
because
ford
itself
would
be
using
its
own
brand
on
the
plugs
and
it
would
be
left
to
kind
of
floundering
if
this
is
the
word
trying
to
break
into
the
aftermarket
and
this
is
designed,
this
provision
and
all
of
the
provisions
of
the
decree
are
designed
to
give
the
new
company
an
opportunity
to
get
a
foothold
at
least
in
the
market
to
try
to
restore
as
much
as
possible
the
market
structure
that
existed
before
the
acquisition.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
fact,
new
fostoria
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
divested
company.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
it
is
dangerous
to
speculate
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that
presumably,
what
is
likely
to
happen
is
this.
the
divested
plant,
the
new
fostoria
under
this
decree
knows
that
at
the
end
of
five
years,
it
may
or
may
not
continue
with
any
part
of
ford’s
business.
it
is
obviously
going
to
be
under
pressure
as
a
result
of
this
decree.
first
to
try
to
gain
all
of
ford’s
business
in
the
initial
five
years,
and
not
just
the
50%
and
indicates
the
business
after
the
fiver
years,
it
does
not
know
however
whet
is
going
to
happen.
conceivably
after
five
years,
ford
may
take
its
business
elsewhere
or
after
10
years,
ford
may
decide
to
manufacture.
so,
i
think
what
is
likely
to
happen
is
from
the
very
outset
the
new
fostoria
is
going
to
do
two
things.
one,
it
is
going
to
do
everything
it
can
to
try
to
satisfy
ford
in
terms
of
quality,
in
terms
of
fair
price,
and
etcetera.
secondly,
it
is
going
to
be
aware
of
the
fact
that
at
the
end
of
five
years
it
has
no
assured
market.
it
may
have
to
start
fighting
at
this
point
in
the
aftermarket,
and
therefore,
it
seems
to
me
in
the
initial
five-year
period,
the
new
company
is
going
to
do
everything
it
can
to
try
to
build
its
business
in
the
aftermarket.
and
if
it
is
going
to
be
building
its
business
and
competing
vigorously
in
the
aftermarket,
i
presume
that
chrysler
and
general
motors
will
also
feel
the
impetuous
to
compete
vigorously
in
the
aftermarket.
now,
if
i
may,
i
would
now
like
to,
having
gone
to
the
second
part
of
the
case
in
some
detailed
relief,
i
now
like
to
go
on
and
discuss
the
merits
of
the
case
in
finding
the
violation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
do
not
think
so.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
is
after
10
years.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
is
hard
to
say.
it
could
get
worse.
i
suppose
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
what
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
did
not.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
did
not
indicate.
i
am
sorry
mr.
justice.
i
did
not
intend
to
indicate
that
there
is
impact.
what
has
happened
in
the
market
has
been
that
two
things
have
happen
in
the
market
and
these
were
the
consequences.
the
basis
of
the
district
court’s
decision
first,
the
opportunity
of
other
spark
plug
manufactures
to
sell
in
the
large
segment
of
the
market
represented
by
ford’s
purchases
from
champion
has
been
eliminated.
that
is
the
first
thing.
secondly
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
there
was
the
opportunity.
there
was
a
very
great
distinction
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct
and
that
opportunity
was
irrevocably
lost.
it
is
irrevocably
lost.
it
is
irrevocably
lost
by
the
foreclosure.
our
comment
a
minute,
we
discussed
in
our
brief,
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
that
during
the
time
that
champion
was
supplying
ford
close
to
the
time
of
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh,
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
might
have
certainly
might
improved.
there
is
evidence
that
people
were
trying
to
sell
to
ford.
autolite
was
trying
to
sell
to
ford.
another
company
called
general
battery
and
ceramics
corporation
was
trying
to
sell
to
ford.
once
this
acquisition
took
place,
these
companies
stop
selling
to
ford.
they
have
no
more
chance
of
selling
to
ford
than
they
have
sell
to
general
motors
because
that
market
was
foreclosed.
now
in
addition
to
that,
the
other
thing
this
acquisition
did
was
it
removed
the
pro-competitive
effect,
the
mediating
influence
that
ford
had
upon
the
market
and
this
impact
on
the
market
was
twofold.
first,
ford
as
a
potential
entrant
into
the
market
and
secondly,
the
impact
ford
had
as
a
customer.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
justice
a
very,
very
significant
distinction,
champion
was
not
acquired
chrysler.
champion
and
chrysler
have
a
(voice
overlap)
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
are
the
largest
market
and
perhaps
at
some
point
we
should
proceed
against
champion.
i
do
not
know,
but
that
it
seems
to
me
again
is
no
reason
not
to
permit
--
is
not
reason
to
permit
this
acquisition
which
is
one,
we
think
clearly
within
the
terms
of
section
7.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
champion
is
a
publicly
held
corporation
and
very
interestingly,
very
interestingly,
the
question
is
to
whether
ford
with
itself
becomes
a
manufacturer.
there
were
two
things.
first,
in
1960,
there
were
some
studies
made
by
high
level
ford
group
which
recommended
to
the
top
management
that
ford
itself
go
into
the
manufacturing
of
spark
plugs.
and
in
addition
to
that,
in
1958
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
was
not
followed.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
was
in
1960.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
was
not
done.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
it
does
indicate
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
it
does
indicate
mr.
justice
that
ford
was
thinking
about
it
and
as
the
district
court
said,
ford
was
the
leading
potential
entrant.
and
i
refer
this
court
to
its
decision
in
the
procter
and
gamble
case.
in
which
the
court
stated
there
the
court
of
appeals
had
reversed
the
commission’s
finding
that
procter
and
gamble
was
a
pro-likely
entrant
into
the
household
bleach
industry
on
the
ground
there
was
no
showing
that
in
fact
it
was
going
to
do
it
and
this
court
in
reversing
said
that
is
immaterial.
the
important
thing
is
that
it
was
the
most
probable
entrant.
and
we
think
this
is
he
most
probable
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
you
have
a
decision
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
you
have
a
decision
not
to
do
it,
but
at
least
as
far
people
in
the
industry
were
concerned,
as
far
as
the
spark
plug
manufacturers
were
concerned,
to
them
it
was
certainly
not
beyond
the
bound
of
possibility
that
ford
would
enter.
let
me
just
mention
one
of
the
thing
mr.
justice,
in
connection
with
champion.
in
1958,
champion
for
the
first
time
went
public
as
a
corporation.
of
course,
it
had
to
file
registration
statement
to
the
sec
and
one
of
the
things
that
came
out
in
this
registration
statement
was
the
very
high
rate
of
return
champion
was
making
and
a
witness
from
electric
autolite
said
that
he
thought
it
was
not
improbable
that
when
ford
realized
that
for
all
these
years,
champion
had
been
making
this
average
of
25%
rate
of
return
to
a
large
extent
as
a
result
of
ford
business
and
that
ford
was
very
seriously
think
about
going
into
the
business.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
what
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
well
but
there
are
two
aspects.
the
first
one
is
the
possibility
that
ford
may
enter.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
am
talking.
the
second
one
is
that
here
was
ford
a
very
large
customer
in
an
industry
that
is
very
concentrated
and
champion
knew
that
it
had
to
satisfy
ford
in
order
to
keep
the
business.
if
i
may
just
refer
your
honor
to
one
statement
here
about
on
page
35
of
the
record,
this
is
the
testimony
of
champion’s
vice
president
in
charge
of
sales
in
the
middle
of
the
page
and
he
said,
we
were
concerned
about
autolite
getting
in
there
because
there
were
no
actual
affiliation,
no
financial
arrangements
between
ford
and
champion.
it
was
just
a
year-to-year
arrangement
and
we
had
to
sell
them
a
quality
product
and
service
them
well
to
retain
that
business.
and
if
autolite
had
been
able
to
persuade
them
that
they
could
have
done
as
well
or
better,
our
account
would
in
jeopardy.
that
is
chrysler
knew
that
in
this
peculiar
market,
it
had
to
satisfy
ford
among
other
things
on
price.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
am
sorry.
champion
had
to
satisfy
ford
on
price.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
is
no
question
about
the
oe
price
and
basically
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
right.
it
is
basically
the
price
on
the
replacement
plugs.
it
is
basically
the
replacement
plug
which
they
sell
for
anywhere
from
35
to
40
cents
because
that
is
where
the
big
profit
is.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
sell
them
to
ford
or
to
the
warehouse
distributors
and
then
in
turn
ford
sends
them
to
each
dealers
and
ford
itself
distributes
them
to
the
warehouse.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
the
majority.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct,
but
ford
itself
--
but
ford
itself
in
addition
to
distributing
through
its
dealers
also
distributes
through
the
warehouse
distributors.
in
other
words,
the
ford
autolite
plug
today
appears
not
only
in
ford
dealers
but
also
in
service
stations
and
garages
and
so
on.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
now
if
ford
has
made
a
conscious
effort
to
try
to
penetrate
the
replacement
market.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
since
the
acquisition.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
the
moderating
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
on
champion.
the
moderate
--
this
is
the
effect
that
ford
had
part
of
the
acquisition
on
champion.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
on
the
price.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
the
aftermarket.
with
the
corresponding
impact
not
only
on
champion’s
prices
ford,
but
champion’s
prices
to
the
warehouse
distributors
because
of
the
federal
trade
commission
1953
order
required
prohibiting
champion
and
all
the
other
manufacturers
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
right
and
i
think
that
is
conceded
and
we
are
talking
about
price
competition
here.
now,
i
want
to
reiterate
not
the
price
charge
by
the
service
man
when
he
tunes
the
motor,
but
the
price
charge
in
selling
when
the
plugs
get
into
the
distribution.
now,
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
he
is
the
vice
president
in
charge
of
sales
and
the
general
sales
manager
of
champion.
that
is
shown
at
22
of
the
record.
the
title
of
each
of
these
witnesses
is
set
forth
in
considerable
detail.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
all
i
read
is
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
think,
well
it
is
a
recognition
on
his
part
that
they
were
previously
had
a
try
to
deal
with
ford.
now,
they
still
have
to
try
to
keep
the
chrysler
account,
but
the
chrysler
account
is
of
course
much
smaller.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
also
there
i
think
there
is
a
recognition
the
part,
of
course
as
we
have
indicated,
prestolite
at
the
moment,
does
not
have
an
oe
--
any
oe
tie.
as
i
say,
i
think
there
is
competition
here.
of
course
there
is
competition
here
but
the
important
thing
is
what
the
acquisition
did
in
terms
of
the
prior
competition
and
prestolite
which
has
a
very
small
share
of
the
market
now
is
certainly
not
the
significant
impact
on
the
market
that
ford,
a
principle
customer
was
upon
champion
the
principal
firm
in
the
market.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
eltra.
well,
eltra
makes
the
prestolite
plug
that
is
why
eltra
which
is
the
successor
to
the
old
autolite
is
now
making
the
prestolite
plug.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
now,
we
were
discussing
the
fact
that
ford
on
the
edge
of
the
market
was
a
mediating
influence
because
of
its
pressures
that
it
exert
on
champion
and
the
possibility
it
might
enter.
there
is
another
aspect
of
the
case,
another
ground
on
which
the
district
court
rested
its
decision
and
that
is
the
fact
that
the
effect
of
this
acquisition
was
to
foreclose
sellers
of
spark
plugs
from
the
significant
share
of
the
market
that
i
have
mentioned.
ford
at
the
time,
it
was
buying
from
champion
before
the
acquisition
had
approximately
10%
of
the
entire
spark
plug
market.
and
this
was
roughly
40
million
plugs
and
the
value
of
these
plugs
was
almost
$10
million.
and
the
impact
of
course
of
this
foreclosure
was
even
greater
because
of
the
fact
that
gm
which
made
approximately
50%
of
the
cost
had
in
fact
preempted
almost
50%,
45%
at
that
time
of
the
oe
market
and
thus
the
oe
--
and
this
closed
off,
this
big
share
of
the
oe
market
and
when
ford
applied
its
share
of
the
market,
there
was
a
foreclosure
of
a
greater
share
of
the
oe
market
in
the
actual
10%
show.
now,
ford’s
answer
to
this,
to
this
foreclosure
point
as
saying,
well,
it
was
really
know
significant
foreclosure
here
because
the
market
was
really
tied
up
with
champion.
we
have
been
buying
from
champion
for
50,
or
60
years
and
the
acquisition
had
not
taken
place
we
would
have
continued,
therefore,
there
was
no
foreclosure
because
all
these
people
were
excluded
from
a
market
they
could
never
hope
to
get
into.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
is
roughly
--
oh,
i
would
say
about
15%.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
may
vary
little
bit,
it
may
vary
a
little.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
ford
has
roughly
30%
of
the
total.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
but
it
is
more
than
the
--
it
is
both
the
--
it
is
more
than
30%,
more
than
15%
of
30%.
the
15%
is
only
the
(voice
overlap)
initial
equipment
market,
but
in
addition,
ford
was
also
selling
in
the
aftermarket.
in
other
words
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
it
does
mr.
justice.
once
ford
owns
its
own
--
once
ford
acquires
electric
autolite
because
ford
is
now
selling
the
electric
autolite
plugs
in
the
aftermarket.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
no.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
of
course
not
but
ford
has
been
foreclosed,
there
is
a
substantial
shift
back
to
the
market.
it
is
segment
of
the
total
spark
plug
purchases
ford
made
prior
to
the
acquisition.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
but
they
used
to
be
able
to
sell
to
ford.
they
would
sell
to
ford
and
ford
in
turn
would
distribute
in
the
aftermarket
and
they
are
foreclosed
from
selling
to
ford
the
products
that
ford
would
sell
in
the
aftermarket
and
that
total,
that
plus
the
oe
market
comes
to
10%
of
total
spark
plug
production.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
a
firm
like
autolite
at
least
could
try
to
sell.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
were
not
able
to.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
were
not
able
to
but
they
tried?
they
were
not
able
to
but
they
tried.
and
that
it
seems
to
us
is
the
significant
thing,
the
knowledge
that
they
were
there,
the
knowledge
that
the
opportunity
at
least
had
a
mediating
effect
on
the
market
and
also
prevented
any
of
these
people
from
ever
getting
in.
they
have
not
been
able
to
sell
for
50
or
60
years.
maybe
they
could.
maybe
they
would
come
up
with
some
new
spark
plug
which
would
enable
them
to
cut
the
price
substantially.
we
do
not
know
but
this
is
foreclosed
them
irrevocably.
they
are
out.
they
cannot
sell
it.
as
i
said,
there
is
no
more
hope
of
their
selling
it
to
ford
now
than
there
is
for
selling
to
general
motors.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
is
unlikely
mr.
justice
because
ford
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
but
as
a
practical
matter
i
think
mr.
chief
justice,
as
a
practical
matter
the
champion
now
under
ordinary
circumstances
is
effectively
foreclosed
from
selling
to
ford.
there
is
no
point
and
that
is
even
trying
to
sell
to
ford
and
even
though
conceivably,
if
they
could
come
up
with
some
revolutionary
new
plug,
maybe
i
do
not
know
what
would
happen,
but
i
think
in
dealing
with
section
7
we
have
to
consider
what
is
the
impact
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition
on
the
competitors.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
certainly,
certainly
not.
what
we
are
trying
to
do
what
we
are
trying
to
do
mr.
chief
justice
is
to
restore
to
this
market
as
much
as
we
can
the
conditions
that
existed
before
the
acquisition
took
place.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
when
i
suggest
restore,
what
i
mean
by
restore
is
not
to
restore
the
champion-ford
relationship.
what
i
mean
is
to
try
to
restore
the
situation
that
existed
before
the
acquisition
where
you
had
only
one
automobile
manufacturer
engaged
in
manufacturing
spark
plugs
and
where
you
had
the
other
two
manufacturers
existing
as
customers
of
spark
plug
firms.
that
is
what
we
are
trying
to
do,
to
restore
to
the
market
a
second
independent
not
affiliated
with
an
automobile
manufacturer,
a
second
independent
manufacturer
of
spark
plugs
to
give
this
company
a
chance
to
build
up
and
to
develop.
now,
let
me,
if
i
may
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon
me?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
champion
supplies
american
motors.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
a
100%.
now
at
one
point,
they
divided
their
business
between,
i
think,
champion
and
autolite,
there
was
a
merger
of
nash
and
another
company
in
1951
and
the
testimony
indicates
they
decided
they
preferred
champion
and
champion
supplies
all
of
their
plugs.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
would
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
do
not
know,
that
would
present
--
i
mean
that
might
present
problems
under
the
robinson-patman
act.
they
discriminate
–-
that
will
be
a
nice
question
whether
they
could
discriminate
and
sell
it
at
lower
cost.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
now
do
get
this,
yes.
i
would
like
now
briefly
to
turn
to
the
question
of
the
appropriate
relief
in
the
case.
we
think
that
in
light
of
the
violations
found
in
this
case,
only
divestiture
would
be
appropriate
and
proper
remedy.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
just
the
plant
and
the
name.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
right,
that
is
not
diverse.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
acquired
some
sales
people.
they
acquired
contracts
with
distributors.
they
required
if
you
might
call
it
an
introduction
to
the
distributor
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
is
to
be
a
new
company.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
now,
that
is
uncertain.
all
--
it
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
the
company
is
for
continuous
to
have
its
distribution
system
that
it
applied
and
of
course
that
also
includes
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct,
but
it
will
have
its
distribution
system
to
enable
it
to
distribute
the
spark
plugs
that
it
will
purchase
during
this
period
and
of
course
eventually,
if
ford
wishes
to
get
into
the
manufacturing
business,
ford
will
then
have
the
benefit
of
this
distribution
system
that
it
has
built
up
over
the
past
10
years.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
suppose
so.
i
had
hesitate
to
commit
myself
on
that
because
it
might
require
a
fairly
careful
examination
of
all
the
circumstances
in
the
industry
and
i
just
would
be
reluctant
to
express
an
off
hand
opinion.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
is
what
remains
of
the
original
autolite
plus
a
lot
more,
eltra
and
–-since
that
time
it
has
merged
with
a
number
of
other
companies
and
it
is
a
$200
million
corporation
itself.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
of
the
spark
plug
market,
that
is
correct.
i
would
suppose,
i
would
think
eltra
might
well
be
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
as
eligible
purchase
but
i
would
not
want
to
commit
myself
to
that
because
this
is
something
we
would
have
to
study
very
carefully.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
just
one
plant.
that
is
all
that
they
acquired
and
eltra
now
by
the
way
has
three
plants.
it
is
now
operating
three
plants.
one
of
which
is
in
canada,
but
we
are
just
talking
of
the
single
plant.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
fostoria
plant?
the
fact
that
here
applied
is
the
fact
that
is
a
large
facility
and
it
needs
to
have
a
very
substantial
volume
of
stock
--
spark
plug
production
apparently
in
order
to
make
a
go
it
over
economically.
it
has
a
capacity
of
about
a
175
million
plugs
a
year.
i
do
not
how
many
it
would
have
to
have
in
order
to
function
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh!
i
suppose
60-70
million
something
in
that
range.
now,
we
start
i
think
with
a
basic
proposition
that
the
normal
remedy
for
an
acquisition
that
violates
section
7
is
to
undo
the
acquisition.
that
is,
if
it
was
illegal
for
a
firm
to
acquire
another
company,
the
simple
and
most
effective
remedy
is
to
require
them
to
get
rid
of
it.
in
this
case,
there
were
two
anticompetitive
effects
that
that
the
district
court
found
and
of
course
in
getting
to
questions
of
relief
we
must
of
course
exhume
the
correctness
of
the
findings
and
therefore
what
we
had
was
two
things:
one,
the
foreclosure
of
the
sellers
of
spark
plugs
from
the
10%
share
of
the
market
that
champion
was
supplying
to
ford
and
two,
the
removal
of
these
mediating
or
pro-competitive
effects
that
resulted
from
ford
remaining
on
the
sidelines
while
it
was
purchasing
from
champion
and
it
seems
to
us
that
the
only
effective
way
we
can
remedy
those
violations
is
to
restore
as
much
as
we
can
the
situation
that
existed.
that
is
to
have
once
again,
ford
as
a
customer,
not
manufacturing,
sitting
on
the
sidelines,
exerting
the
pro-competitive
influence
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
as
a
potential
entrant,
as
once
again
as
a
potential
entrant.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
for
10
years,
for
10
years.
it
is
not
permanently
enjoined.
it
is
enjoined
for
10
years.
in
order
to
give
the
divested
company
the
chance
to
build
itself
up
in
the
market.
in
order
to
give
the
divested
company
the
opportunity
once
again
to
become
a
strong,
vigorous
competitive
factor
in
the
market
and
once
that
happens,
once
that
happens
then
ford
is
perfectly
free
if
it
wishes
to
enter
the
market
and
even
at
the
time,
even
at
the
time
while
this
is
going
on
of
course,
the
divested
company
will
be
well
aware
of
this
possibility
and
this
itself
will
exert
pressures
under
divested
company
to
deal
most
favorably
with
ford.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
in
effect,
in
effect,
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
unless
eltra
does
purchase
it,
but
even
if
eltra
purchases
it,
you
would
have
a
very
different
market
than
you
had.
you
have
a
market
comparable
to
what
you
had
before,
not
exactly,
but
you
would
have
a
comparable
market
with
two
significant
independent
spark
plug
manufacturers
and
only
one
of
the
big
three
automobile
companies
engaged
in
the
manufacture
of
spark
plugs.
the
--
our
economist
indicated
that
the
only
real
hope
of
ultimately
achieving
deconcentration
in
this
market
and
i
just
paused
to
point
out
that
in
a
market
of
this
type,
an
oligopolistic,
very
tightly
structured
market
with
high
barriers
to
entry,
no
price
competition,
it
is
vital
that
we
do
everything
in
the
hope
of
procuring
deconcentration.
every
step
that
may
lead
to
deconcentration,
may
lead
to
more
vigorous
competition
should
be
incurred.
the
only
hope
of
any
real
deconcentration
in
this
market
is
breaking
the
oe
tie.
that
is
trying
to
persuade
the
automobile
mechanics
that
really
they
do
not
have
to
use
the
original
equipment
plug.
now,
mr.
seymour
suggested
that
while
you
have
these
all
purpose
plugs,
they
are
really
not
quite
as
good.
the
average
service
station
or
a
garage
has
charts
would
show
substitutability
of
plugs
and
it
is
interesting
thing
that
ford’s
own
witness
testified
that
he
recognized
that
the
plugs
that
ford
makes,
they
all
make
--
all
three
of
them,
champion,
ford,
and
general
motors
that
is
autolite,
make
all
purpose
plugs
and
he
testifies
that
well
he
thought
that
the
ford
plugs
would
do
just
as
good
a
job
as
the
champion
in
the
ac
plugs
that
were
original
equipment
in
chrysler
and
general
motors
cars
and
he
was
asked
and
he
said
i
suppose
you
would
have
to
acknowledge
that
the
champion
in
ac
plugs
that
is
a
substitute
for
your
plugs
will
do
just
as
well,
and
he
said
well
yes.
evidence
for
example
shows
that
ford
was
much
elated
when
they
discovered
few
years
ago
that
at
some
trials,
automotive
trials
down
in
florida,
all
the
people
who
were
driving
the
stop
pontiac
(ph)
automobiles
were
using
electric
autolite
spark
plugs.
they
said,
this
just
shows
how
good
our
plugs
are
and
the
indication
is
that
the
real
hope,
the
real
hope
of
any
deconcentration
in
this
market
is
to
break
the
oe
tie
and
to
persuade
people
that
they
do
not
have
to
buy
the
original
equipment
plug
if
the
other
plug
would
have
--
and
of
course,
there
is
going
to
be
an
automobile
manufacturer
owning
a
spark
plug
firm.
it
is
going
to
be
much
less
likely
to
be
pushing
the
sales
of
the
private
brands
in
the
aftermarket
than
an
independent,
who
--
particularly
this
independent,
the
divested
company
that
knows
its
ultimate
future
may
depend
on
success
in
penetrating
into
the
aftermarket.
now,
ford
complains
about
the
requirement
that
it
purchased
its
half
of
its
need
from
autolite
because
it
says,
this
is
going
to
cause
also
some
problems
in
terms
of
pollution
control,
that
we
will
not
have
adequate
control
over
the
quality
of
the
plugs
and
this
is
going
to
be
very
unfortunate
that
we
can
do
a
much
better
job
ourselves.
well,
first
of
all,
the
decree
says
that
ford
in
purchasing
the
half
of
its
requirements
from
autolite
under
autolite’s
name
that
the
product
must
conform
to
ford’s
designs,
specifications,
quality
standards
and
delivery
requirements
and
to
be
priced
competitively.
so
that
ford
is
protected
because
the
decree
does
guarantee
it
and
the
requirements
are
contingent
on
the
plugs
meeting
those
standards.
moreover,
as
i
have
indicated
the
divested
company
will
be
under
very
great
pressure
to
satisfy
ford,
both
in
the
hope
of
getting
more
than
50%
of
the
business
and
in
the
hope
of
retaining
that
business
after
the
five
years.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
would
be
not
be
free
to
making
themselves,
but
it
seems
mr.
justice,
realistically,
considering
the
nature
of
the
relationship,
i
am
sure
the
divested
company
is
going
to
do
everything
it
can
to
meet
ford's
standards.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
the
record
shows
that
it
is
very
close
collaboration
between
the
independent
spark
plug
manufacturers,
prior
for
example
to
the
acquisition
ford
worked
very
closely
with
champion
and
they
worked
close
together.
it
seems
that
ford
for
50
years
was
fully
satisfied
with
the
product
it
was
getting
from
champion.
even
today,
chrysler
has
not
thus
far
attempted
to
integrate
and
there
is
no
indication
that
chrysler
is
not
getting
satisfactory
quality
and
there
is
not
--
no
indication
that
chrysler
is
not
able.
if
i
may,
mr.
justice
i
would
like
to
just
close
with
one
thought
if
i
may
which
is,
on
the
question
of
the
use
of
ford’s
own
trade
name
on
plugs.
ford
makes
the
point
that
this
is
a
harsh
remedy,
that
it
is
a
penalty,
that
it
is
unfair,
that
it
is
unnecessary
and
they
say
this
goes
far
beyond
anything
is
ever
happened
here
because
even
prior
to
the
acquisition.
ford
was
perfectly
free
at
anytime
to
manufacture
under
its
own
trade
name
and
now
it
its
precluded
and
i
think
the
answer
to
this
contention
is
something
that
this
court
stated
some
years
ago
in
federal
trade
commission
v.
national
lead
company
in
352
u.s.
when
the
complaint
was
there
made
that
a
decree
subjected
the
defendants
to
very
strict
strictures
and
was
unfair.
the
court
said
that
those
“violating
the
act”
must
expect
some
fencing
in.
i
think
ford
here
has
violated
the
act
through
this
acquisition
and
it
too
must
expect
some
fencing
in.
thank
you.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
section
7
of
the
clayton
act,
of
course
deals
with
the
probabilities
not
with
certainties.
the
statutory
standard
is
that
acquisitions
are
condemned
whose
effect
maybe,
maybe
substantially
to
less
the
composition
and
as
this
court
has
stated
and
as
the
legislative
history
indicates
all
that
is
required
is
that
there
be
a
reasonable
probability
of
anticompetitive
effect.
and
in
the
philadelphia
bank
opinion,
this
court
stated
that
a
determination
of
whether
there
is
such
a
reasonable
probability
of
anticompetitive
effect
as
it
said
requires
not
merely
an
appraisal
of
the
immediate
impact
of
the
merger
upon
competition,
but
a
prediction
of
its
impact
upon
competitive
conditions
in
the
future
and
also
added
that
a
prediction
as
to
the
future
impact
is
sound
only
if
it
is
based
upon
a
firm
understanding
of
the
structure
of
the
market.
that
is
the
impact
of
section
7
is
to
prevent
anticompetitive
changes
in
the
structure
of
the
market.
the
way
the
market
operates.
now,
there
is
no
question
about
the
market
in
this
case.
it
is
one
of
the
most
concentrated
markets
that
we
can
find.
for
more
than
20
years,
the
three
leading
firms
that
had
between
90
and
95%
of
the
market,
in
most
instances
closer
to
95
and
that
condition
is
continued
since
the
acquisition.
there
are
also
as
mr.
seymour
has
indicated
high
entry
barriers
in
this
market
primarily
because
of
the
fact
that
due
to
the
oe
tie,
a
manufacturer
finds
it
almost
impossible
to
get
into
the
lucrative
replacement
market
unless
he
has
the
oe
tie
and
you
cannot
get
the
oe
tie
unless
the
you
can
get
the
business
of
one
of
the
major
automobile
manufacturer.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
you
have
to
sell
way
below
cost.
so
what
you
have
is
this
is
a
market
where
there
is
a
high
concentration
and
very
high
barriers
to
entry
and
is
to
be
expected
in
such
a
market,
this
little
price
competition.
i
am
not
talking
now
of
the
price
competition
at
the
service
station
or
the
garage
level
where
you
go
to
have
your
motor
tuned.
i
am
talking
of
the
competition
at
the
next
level,
at
the
distributor
level,
at
the
warehouse
level
to
prices
at
which
the
manufacturers
and
the
distributors
of
spark
plugs
put
the
plugs
into
the
distribution
channel.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
do
not
agree
as
he
characterizes
it.
of
course
have
result
of
the
acquisition,
ford
now,
autolite
in
the
hands
of
ford
now
has
a
greater
share
of
the
market
than
autolite
had
before
the
acquisition,
but
of
course
what
has
happened
is
that
since
the
ford
account
was
a
much
larger
account
than
the
chrysler
account,
necessarily
when
autolite
shifted
its
custom
from
chrysler
to
ford,
it
necessary
got
a
larger
share
of
the
market
and
conversely
when
champion
after
it
had
lost
the
ford
account,
picked
up
the
chrysler
account,
it
had
a
smallest
share
of
the
market.
now,
we
are
not
saying
that
the
correspondence
is
automatic
but
we
think
this
reflects
a
major
share
of
the
shift
in
the
market,
but
we
do
not
think
the
market
is
anymore
competitive
mr.
chief
justice.
now,
we
had
an
economist
to
testify
on
this
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
even
after
the
shift,
there
has
been
no
basic
change
in
the
market.
the
market
is
still
all
oligopolistic.
the
market
is
still
the
big
three
at
95%.
there
is
still
virtually
no
price
competition
in
the
market.
this
new
competitor
that
has
been
referred
to
the
eltra
company,
the
eltra
company
as
the
district
court
characterizes
it
as
a
pygmy.
it
has
something
now,
even
now
something
like
1.4
or
1.6%
of
the
market.
it
has
its
own
name
brand
prestolite
which
is
made
very
little
progress
in
the
market.
it
is
basically
attempting
to
sell
in
the
aftermarket
through
the
private
brand
label
and
it
just
cannot
get
into
the
market
at
any
substantial
measure
because
of
the
original
equipment
tie.
we
do
not
conceive
that
the
market
is
anymore
competitive.
in
fact
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
still
champion.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
they
may
have
to
try
it.
they
may
have
to
try
harder.
they
may
have
to
sell
more
because
having
lost
the
ford
account,
they
may
find
it
necessary
to
fight
more
vigorously
for
business
in
the
aftermarket
but
nevertheless,
nevertheless,
all
there
has
been
is
a
slight
shifting
of
shares
among
the
firms
in
the
market
and
we
had
an
economist,
a
distinguished
economist
professor
mann
(ph)
who
testified
that
in
a
market
of
this
type,
in
a
market
of
this
type,
the
shifting
of
shares,
like
shifting
of
shares
among
the
three
leading
firms
that
together
have
95%
does
not
really
reflect
any
greater
vigor
of
competition
in
the
market.
there
is
no
price
competition.
this
is
not
injected
any
greater
price
competition
into
the
market.
there
is
no
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
price
is
not
the
only
area
of
competition
mr.
chief
justice,
but
one
of
the
characteristics
of
an
oligopolistic
market
is
the
absence
of
price
competition
and
price
competition
is
in
the
sense
the
ultimate
of
competition.
i
mean
that
is
what
is
really
all
about
is
prices
and
if
you
get
into
a
market
of
this
type
where
you
have
a
rigid
structure
and
i
might
mention
in
passing,
one
of
the
things
that
is
pointed
out
by
our
economist
and
one
of
the
things
that
the
record
shows
is
in
this
type
of
a
market
price
of
profit
is
very
high,
although
the
average
return
of
all
manufacturing
enterprises
in
the
country
is
10%
on
investment,
champion
over
15-year
period
had
an
average
of
25%.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
do
not
think
there
is
anything
mr.
justice
that
can
be
done
about
it
here
except
i
think
the
fact
that
gm
has
in
effect
tied
up
such
a
large
share
of
the
market
because
of
its
own
manufacturing
of
plugs
is
an
important
consideration
as
to
why
it
is
significant
and
vital
to
preserve
the
other
forces
in
the
market
that
tend
to
be
competitive.
now,
i
would
like
to
turn
this
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
may
be
mr.
justice,
on
the
other
hand
the
fact
that
general
motors
is
now
engaged
in
the
manufacture
of
its
own
spark
plugs
is
no
reason
why
ford
should
be
permitted
to
do
the
same
thing
whereas
we
believe
and
i
will
come
to
this
in
a
minute
now,
you
think
the
effect
of
ford’s
acquisition
of
the
autolite
company
and
going
into
the
manufacture
has
definite
and
are
competitive
consequence.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct
because
section
7
mr.
justice
speaks
of
acquisition.
any
firm
is
free
to
develop
it
internally.
that
is
exactly
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
under
this
decree
and
as
i
will
cover,
and
the
reason
for
that
mr.
justice
is
that
ford
is
this
prohibited
from
manufacturing
for
10
years
in
order
to
give
the
divested
company
the
opportunity
to
get
on
its
feet
again.
basically,
it
is
an
attempt,
four
to
ten
years
has
had
the
benefits
of
the
ownership
of
electric
autolite.
ford
has
acquired
in
this
ten-year
period
many
things.
it
has
developed
great
know-how.
it
has
built
up
a
staff
of
engineers.
it
acquired
autolite’s
entire
distribution
system,
it
is
entry
for
these
warehouse
distributors
who
are
so
important
and
penetrating
into
the
aftermarket
and
the
purpose
of
a
ten-year
provision
in
effect
is
to
put
the
thing
back,
put
the
thing
back
the
way
it
was
before
that
once
again
ford
to
be
a
customer,
there
will
be
a
large
independent
manufacturer
and
to
give
this
large
company
the
opportunity
to
begin
to
develop
because
if
i
may
just
say
one
other
thing
on
that
mr.
justice,
if
ford
were
permitted
to
go
into
manufacture
immediately,
the
likely
first
--
the
likely
thing
that
will
happen
would
be
this.
and
of
course,
i
mentioned
that
the
provisions
of
the
decree
are
all
interrelated
because
if
ford
were
permitted
to
go
into
manufacture
itself
and
there
was
no
ban
on
the
use
of
ford’s
name
or
even
with
the
present
thing,
what
probably
would
happen
is
ford
would
purchase
its
50%
requirements
from
divested
plant
and
put
those
plugs
into
the
aftermarket
to
sell
for
the
replacement
of
the
ford
plugs
that
are
ready
on
the
road
and
would
begin
manufacturing
under
its
own
name
and
selling
under
its
own
name
and
by
in
a
very
short
period,
after
five
or
six
years
when
the
market
for
the
replacement
plugs
was
exhausted,
this
new
company
would
find
itself
with
no
basis
at
all,
it
could
not
--
it
would
have
no
oe
tie
because
ford
itself
would
be
using
its
own
brand
on
the
plugs
and
it
would
be
left
to
kind
of
floundering
if
this
is
the
word
trying
to
break
into
the
aftermarket
and
this
is
designed,
this
provision
and
all
of
the
provisions
of
the
decree
are
designed
to
give
the
new
company
an
opportunity
to
get
a
foothold
at
least
in
the
market
to
try
to
restore
as
much
as
possible
the
market
structure
that
existed
before
the
acquisition.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
fact,
new
fostoria
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
divested
company.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
it
is
dangerous
to
speculate
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that
presumably,
what
is
likely
to
happen
is
this.
the
divested
plant,
the
new
fostoria
under
this
decree
knows
that
at
the
end
of
five
years,
it
may
or
may
not
continue
with
any
part
of
ford’s
business.
it
is
obviously
going
to
be
under
pressure
as
a
result
of
this
decree.
first
to
try
to
gain
all
of
ford’s
business
in
the
initial
five
years,
and
not
just
the
50%
and
indicates
the
business
after
the
fiver
years,
it
does
not
know
however
whet
is
going
to
happen.
conceivably
after
five
years,
ford
may
take
its
business
elsewhere
or
after
10
years,
ford
may
decide
to
manufacture.
so,
i
think
what
is
likely
to
happen
is
from
the
very
outset
the
new
fostoria
is
going
to
do
two
things.
one,
it
is
going
to
do
everything
it
can
to
try
to
satisfy
ford
in
terms
of
quality,
in
terms
of
fair
price,
and
etcetera.
secondly,
it
is
going
to
be
aware
of
the
fact
that
at
the
end
of
five
years
it
has
no
assured
market.
it
may
have
to
start
fighting
at
this
point
in
the
aftermarket,
and
therefore,
it
seems
to
me
in
the
initial
five-year
period,
the
new
company
is
going
to
do
everything
it
can
to
try
to
build
its
business
in
the
aftermarket.
and
if
it
is
going
to
be
building
its
business
and
competing
vigorously
in
the
aftermarket,
i
presume
that
chrysler
and
general
motors
will
also
feel
the
impetuous
to
compete
vigorously
in
the
aftermarket.
now,
if
i
may,
i
would
now
like
to,
having
gone
to
the
second
part
of
the
case
in
some
detailed
relief,
i
now
like
to
go
on
and
discuss
the
merits
of
the
case
in
finding
the
violation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
do
not
think
so.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
is
after
10
years.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
is
hard
to
say.
it
could
get
worse.
i
suppose
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
what
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
did
not.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
did
not
indicate.
i
am
sorry
mr.
justice.
i
did
not
intend
to
indicate
that
there
is
impact.
what
has
happened
in
the
market
has
been
that
two
things
have
happen
in
the
market
and
these
were
the
consequences.
the
basis
of
the
district
court’s
decision
first,
the
opportunity
of
other
spark
plug
manufactures
to
sell
in
the
large
segment
of
the
market
represented
by
ford’s
purchases
from
champion
has
been
eliminated.
that
is
the
first
thing.
secondly
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
there
was
the
opportunity.
there
was
a
very
great
distinction
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct
and
that
opportunity
was
irrevocably
lost.
it
is
irrevocably
lost.
it
is
irrevocably
lost
by
the
foreclosure.
our
comment
a
minute,
we
discussed
in
our
brief,
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
that
during
the
time
that
champion
was
supplying
ford
close
to
the
time
of
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh,
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
might
have
certainly
might
improved.
there
is
evidence
that
people
were
trying
to
sell
to
ford.
autolite
was
trying
to
sell
to
ford.
another
company
called
general
battery
and
ceramics
corporation
was
trying
to
sell
to
ford.
once
this
acquisition
took
place,
these
companies
stop
selling
to
ford.
they
have
no
more
chance
of
selling
to
ford
than
they
have
sell
to
general
motors
because
that
market
was
foreclosed.
now
in
addition
to
that,
the
other
thing
this
acquisition
did
was
it
removed
the
pro-competitive
effect,
the
mediating
influence
that
ford
had
upon
the
market
and
this
impact
on
the
market
was
twofold.
first,
ford
as
a
potential
entrant
into
the
market
and
secondly,
the
impact
ford
had
as
a
customer.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
justice
a
very,
very
significant
distinction,
champion
was
not
acquired
chrysler.
champion
and
chrysler
have
a
(voice
overlap)
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
are
the
largest
market
and
perhaps
at
some
point
we
should
proceed
against
champion.
i
do
not
know,
but
that
it
seems
to
me
again
is
no
reason
not
to
permit
--
is
not
reason
to
permit
this
acquisition
which
is
one,
we
think
clearly
within
the
terms
of
section
7.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
champion
is
a
publicly
held
corporation
and
very
interestingly,
very
interestingly,
the
question
is
to
whether
ford
with
itself
becomes
a
manufacturer.
there
were
two
things.
first,
in
1960,
there
were
some
studies
made
by
high
level
ford
group
which
recommended
to
the
top
management
that
ford
itself
go
into
the
manufacturing
of
spark
plugs.
and
in
addition
to
that,
in
1958
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
was
not
followed.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
was
in
1960.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
was
not
done.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
it
does
indicate
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
it
does
indicate
mr.
justice
that
ford
was
thinking
about
it
and
as
the
district
court
said,
ford
was
the
leading
potential
entrant.
and
i
refer
this
court
to
its
decision
in
the
procter
and
gamble
case.
in
which
the
court
stated
there
the
court
of
appeals
had
reversed
the
commission’s
finding
that
procter
and
gamble
was
a
pro-likely
entrant
into
the
household
bleach
industry
on
the
ground
there
was
no
showing
that
in
fact
it
was
going
to
do
it
and
this
court
in
reversing
said
that
is
immaterial.
the
important
thing
is
that
it
was
the
most
probable
entrant.
and
we
think
this
is
he
most
probable
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
you
have
a
decision
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
you
have
a
decision
not
to
do
it,
but
at
least
as
far
people
in
the
industry
were
concerned,
as
far
as
the
spark
plug
manufacturers
were
concerned,
to
them
it
was
certainly
not
beyond
the
bound
of
possibility
that
ford
would
enter.
let
me
just
mention
one
of
the
thing
mr.
justice,
in
connection
with
champion.
in
1958,
champion
for
the
first
time
went
public
as
a
corporation.
of
course,
it
had
to
file
registration
statement
to
the
sec
and
one
of
the
things
that
came
out
in
this
registration
statement
was
the
very
high
rate
of
return
champion
was
making
and
a
witness
from
electric
autolite
said
that
he
thought
it
was
not
improbable
that
when
ford
realized
that
for
all
these
years,
champion
had
been
making
this
average
of
25%
rate
of
return
to
a
large
extent
as
a
result
of
ford
business
and
that
ford
was
very
seriously
think
about
going
into
the
business.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
what
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
well
but
there
are
two
aspects.
the
first
one
is
the
possibility
that
ford
may
enter.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
am
talking.
the
second
one
is
that
here
was
ford
a
very
large
customer
in
an
industry
that
is
very
concentrated
and
champion
knew
that
it
had
to
satisfy
ford
in
order
to
keep
the
business.
if
i
may
just
refer
your
honor
to
one
statement
here
about
on
page
35
of
the
record,
this
is
the
testimony
of
champion’s
vice
president
in
charge
of
sales
in
the
middle
of
the
page
and
he
said,
we
were
concerned
about
autolite
getting
in
there
because
there
were
no
actual
affiliation,
no
financial
arrangements
between
ford
and
champion.
it
was
just
a
year-to-year
arrangement
and
we
had
to
sell
them
a
quality
product
and
service
them
well
to
retain
that
business.
and
if
autolite
had
been
able
to
persuade
them
that
they
could
have
done
as
well
or
better,
our
account
would
in
jeopardy.
that
is
chrysler
knew
that
in
this
peculiar
market,
it
had
to
satisfy
ford
among
other
things
on
price.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
am
sorry.
champion
had
to
satisfy
ford
on
price.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
is
no
question
about
the
oe
price
and
basically
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
right.
it
is
basically
the
price
on
the
replacement
plugs.
it
is
basically
the
replacement
plug
which
they
sell
for
anywhere
from
35
to
40
cents
because
that
is
where
the
big
profit
is.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
sell
them
to
ford
or
to
the
warehouse
distributors
and
then
in
turn
ford
sends
them
to
each
dealers
and
ford
itself
distributes
them
to
the
warehouse.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
the
majority.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct,
but
ford
itself
--
but
ford
itself
in
addition
to
distributing
through
its
dealers
also
distributes
through
the
warehouse
distributors.
in
other
words,
the
ford
autolite
plug
today
appears
not
only
in
ford
dealers
but
also
in
service
stations
and
garages
and
so
on.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
now
if
ford
has
made
a
conscious
effort
to
try
to
penetrate
the
replacement
market.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
since
the
acquisition.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
the
moderating
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
on
champion.
the
moderate
--
this
is
the
effect
that
ford
had
part
of
the
acquisition
on
champion.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
on
the
price.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
the
aftermarket.
with
the
corresponding
impact
not
only
on
champion’s
prices
ford,
but
champion’s
prices
to
the
warehouse
distributors
because
of
the
federal
trade
commission
1953
order
required
prohibiting
champion
and
all
the
other
manufacturers
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
right
and
i
think
that
is
conceded
and
we
are
talking
about
price
competition
here.
now,
i
want
to
reiterate
not
the
price
charge
by
the
service
man
when
he
tunes
the
motor,
but
the
price
charge
in
selling
when
the
plugs
get
into
the
distribution.
now,
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
he
is
the
vice
president
in
charge
of
sales
and
the
general
sales
manager
of
champion.
that
is
shown
at
22
of
the
record.
the
title
of
each
of
these
witnesses
is
set
forth
in
considerable
detail.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
all
i
read
is
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
think,
well
it
is
a
recognition
on
his
part
that
they
were
previously
had
a
try
to
deal
with
ford.
now,
they
still
have
to
try
to
keep
the
chrysler
account,
but
the
chrysler
account
is
of
course
much
smaller.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
also
there
i
think
there
is
a
recognition
the
part,
of
course
as
we
have
indicated,
prestolite
at
the
moment,
does
not
have
an
oe
--
any
oe
tie.
as
i
say,
i
think
there
is
competition
here.
of
course
there
is
competition
here
but
the
important
thing
is
what
the
acquisition
did
in
terms
of
the
prior
competition
and
prestolite
which
has
a
very
small
share
of
the
market
now
is
certainly
not
the
significant
impact
on
the
market
that
ford,
a
principle
customer
was
upon
champion
the
principal
firm
in
the
market.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
eltra.
well,
eltra
makes
the
prestolite
plug
that
is
why
eltra
which
is
the
successor
to
the
old
autolite
is
now
making
the
prestolite
plug.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
now,
we
were
discussing
the
fact
that
ford
on
the
edge
of
the
market
was
a
mediating
influence
because
of
its
pressures
that
it
exert
on
champion
and
the
possibility
it
might
enter.
there
is
another
aspect
of
the
case,
another
ground
on
which
the
district
court
rested
its
decision
and
that
is
the
fact
that
the
effect
of
this
acquisition
was
to
foreclose
sellers
of
spark
plugs
from
the
significant
share
of
the
market
that
i
have
mentioned.
ford
at
the
time,
it
was
buying
from
champion
before
the
acquisition
had
approximately
10%
of
the
entire
spark
plug
market.
and
this
was
roughly
40
million
plugs
and
the
value
of
these
plugs
was
almost
$10
million.
and
the
impact
of
course
of
this
foreclosure
was
even
greater
because
of
the
fact
that
gm
which
made
approximately
50%
of
the
cost
had
in
fact
preempted
almost
50%,
45%
at
that
time
of
the
oe
market
and
thus
the
oe
--
and
this
closed
off,
this
big
share
of
the
oe
market
and
when
ford
applied
its
share
of
the
market,
there
was
a
foreclosure
of
a
greater
share
of
the
oe
market
in
the
actual
10%
show.
now,
ford’s
answer
to
this,
to
this
foreclosure
point
as
saying,
well,
it
was
really
know
significant
foreclosure
here
because
the
market
was
really
tied
up
with
champion.
we
have
been
buying
from
champion
for
50,
or
60
years
and
the
acquisition
had
not
taken
place
we
would
have
continued,
therefore,
there
was
no
foreclosure
because
all
these
people
were
excluded
from
a
market
they
could
never
hope
to
get
into.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
is
roughly
--
oh,
i
would
say
about
15%.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
may
vary
little
bit,
it
may
vary
a
little.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
ford
has
roughly
30%
of
the
total.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
but
it
is
more
than
the
--
it
is
both
the
--
it
is
more
than
30%,
more
than
15%
of
30%.
the
15%
is
only
the
(voice
overlap)
initial
equipment
market,
but
in
addition,
ford
was
also
selling
in
the
aftermarket.
in
other
words
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
it
does
mr.
justice.
once
ford
owns
its
own
--
once
ford
acquires
electric
autolite
because
ford
is
now
selling
the
electric
autolite
plugs
in
the
aftermarket.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
no.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
of
course
not
but
ford
has
been
foreclosed,
there
is
a
substantial
shift
back
to
the
market.
it
is
segment
of
the
total
spark
plug
purchases
ford
made
prior
to
the
acquisition.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
but
they
used
to
be
able
to
sell
to
ford.
they
would
sell
to
ford
and
ford
in
turn
would
distribute
in
the
aftermarket
and
they
are
foreclosed
from
selling
to
ford
the
products
that
ford
would
sell
in
the
aftermarket
and
that
total,
that
plus
the
oe
market
comes
to
10%
of
total
spark
plug
production.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
a
firm
like
autolite
at
least
could
try
to
sell.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
were
not
able
to.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
were
not
able
to
but
they
tried?
they
were
not
able
to
but
they
tried.
and
that
it
seems
to
us
is
the
significant
thing,
the
knowledge
that
they
were
there,
the
knowledge
that
the
opportunity
at
least
had
a
mediating
effect
on
the
market
and
also
prevented
any
of
these
people
from
ever
getting
in.
they
have
not
been
able
to
sell
for
50
or
60
years.
maybe
they
could.
maybe
they
would
come
up
with
some
new
spark
plug
which
would
enable
them
to
cut
the
price
substantially.
we
do
not
know
but
this
is
foreclosed
them
irrevocably.
they
are
out.
they
cannot
sell
it.
as
i
said,
there
is
no
more
hope
of
their
selling
it
to
ford
now
than
there
is
for
selling
to
general
motors.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
is
unlikely
mr.
justice
because
ford
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
but
as
a
practical
matter
i
think
mr.
chief
justice,
as
a
practical
matter
the
champion
now
under
ordinary
circumstances
is
effectively
foreclosed
from
selling
to
ford.
there
is
no
point
and
that
is
even
trying
to
sell
to
ford
and
even
though
conceivably,
if
they
could
come
up
with
some
revolutionary
new
plug,
maybe
i
do
not
know
what
would
happen,
but
i
think
in
dealing
with
section
7
we
have
to
consider
what
is
the
impact
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition
on
the
competitors.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
certainly,
certainly
not.
what
we
are
trying
to
do
what
we
are
trying
to
do
mr.
chief
justice
is
to
restore
to
this
market
as
much
as
we
can
the
conditions
that
existed
before
the
acquisition
took
place.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
when
i
suggest
restore,
what
i
mean
by
restore
is
not
to
restore
the
champion-ford
relationship.
what
i
mean
is
to
try
to
restore
the
situation
that
existed
before
the
acquisition
where
you
had
only
one
automobile
manufacturer
engaged
in
manufacturing
spark
plugs
and
where
you
had
the
other
two
manufacturers
existing
as
customers
of
spark
plug
firms.
that
is
what
we
are
trying
to
do,
to
restore
to
the
market
a
second
independent
not
affiliated
with
an
automobile
manufacturer,
a
second
independent
manufacturer
of
spark
plugs
to
give
this
company
a
chance
to
build
up
and
to
develop.
now,
let
me,
if
i
may
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon
me?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
champion
supplies
american
motors.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
a
100%.
now
at
one
point,
they
divided
their
business
between,
i
think,
champion
and
autolite,
there
was
a
merger
of
nash
and
another
company
in
1951
and
the
testimony
indicates
they
decided
they
preferred
champion
and
champion
supplies
all
of
their
plugs.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
would
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
do
not
know,
that
would
present
--
i
mean
that
might
present
problems
under
the
robinson-patman
act.
they
discriminate
–-
that
will
be
a
nice
question
whether
they
could
discriminate
and
sell
it
at
lower
cost.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
now
do
get
this,
yes.
i
would
like
now
briefly
to
turn
to
the
question
of
the
appropriate
relief
in
the
case.
we
think
that
in
light
of
the
violations
found
in
this
case,
only
divestiture
would
be
appropriate
and
proper
remedy.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
just
the
plant
and
the
name.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
right,
that
is
not
diverse.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
acquired
some
sales
people.
they
acquired
contracts
with
distributors.
they
required
if
you
might
call
it
an
introduction
to
the
distributor
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
is
to
be
a
new
company.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
now,
that
is
uncertain.
all
--
it
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
the
company
is
for
continuous
to
have
its
distribution
system
that
it
applied
and
of
course
that
also
includes
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct,
but
it
will
have
its
distribution
system
to
enable
it
to
distribute
the
spark
plugs
that
it
will
purchase
during
this
period
and
of
course
eventually,
if
ford
wishes
to
get
into
the
manufacturing
business,
ford
will
then
have
the
benefit
of
this
distribution
system
that
it
has
built
up
over
the
past
10
years.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
suppose
so.
i
had
hesitate
to
commit
myself
on
that
because
it
might
require
a
fairly
careful
examination
of
all
the
circumstances
in
the
industry
and
i
just
would
be
reluctant
to
express
an
off
hand
opinion.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
is
what
remains
of
the
original
autolite
plus
a
lot
more,
eltra
and
–-since
that
time
it
has
merged
with
a
number
of
other
companies
and
it
is
a
$200
million
corporation
itself.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
of
the
spark
plug
market,
that
is
correct.
i
would
suppose,
i
would
think
eltra
might
well
be
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
as
eligible
purchase
but
i
would
not
want
to
commit
myself
to
that
because
this
is
something
we
would
have
to
study
very
carefully.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
just
one
plant.
that
is
all
that
they
acquired
and
eltra
now
by
the
way
has
three
plants.
it
is
now
operating
three
plants.
one
of
which
is
in
canada,
but
we
are
just
talking
of
the
single
plant.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
fostoria
plant?
the
fact
that
here
applied
is
the
fact
that
is
a
large
facility
and
it
needs
to
have
a
very
substantial
volume
of
stock
--
spark
plug
production
apparently
in
order
to
make
a
go
it
over
economically.
it
has
a
capacity
of
about
a
175
million
plugs
a
year.
i
do
not
how
many
it
would
have
to
have
in
order
to
function
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh!
i
suppose
60-70
million
something
in
that
range.
now,
we
start
i
think
with
a
basic
proposition
that
the
normal
remedy
for
an
acquisition
that
violates
section
7
is
to
undo
the
acquisition.
that
is,
if
it
was
illegal
for
a
firm
to
acquire
another
company,
the
simple
and
most
effective
remedy
is
to
require
them
to
get
rid
of
it.
in
this
case,
there
were
two
anticompetitive
effects
that
that
the
district
court
found
and
of
course
in
getting
to
questions
of
relief
we
must
of
course
exhume
the
correctness
of
the
findings
and
therefore
what
we
had
was
two
things:
one,
the
foreclosure
of
the
sellers
of
spark
plugs
from
the
10%
share
of
the
market
that
champion
was
supplying
to
ford
and
two,
the
removal
of
these
mediating
or
pro-competitive
effects
that
resulted
from
ford
remaining
on
the
sidelines
while
it
was
purchasing
from
champion
and
it
seems
to
us
that
the
only
effective
way
we
can
remedy
those
violations
is
to
restore
as
much
as
we
can
the
situation
that
existed.
that
is
to
have
once
again,
ford
as
a
customer,
not
manufacturing,
sitting
on
the
sidelines,
exerting
the
pro-competitive
influence
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
as
a
potential
entrant,
as
once
again
as
a
potential
entrant.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
for
10
years,
for
10
years.
it
is
not
permanently
enjoined.
it
is
enjoined
for
10
years.
in
order
to
give
the
divested
company
the
chance
to
build
itself
up
in
the
market.
in
order
to
give
the
divested
company
the
opportunity
once
again
to
become
a
strong,
vigorous
competitive
factor
in
the
market
and
once
that
happens,
once
that
happens
then
ford
is
perfectly
free
if
it
wishes
to
enter
the
market
and
even
at
the
time,
even
at
the
time
while
this
is
going
on
of
course,
the
divested
company
will
be
well
aware
of
this
possibility
and
this
itself
will
exert
pressures
under
divested
company
to
deal
most
favorably
with
ford.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
in
effect,
in
effect,
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
unless
eltra
does
purchase
it,
but
even
if
eltra
purchases
it,
you
would
have
a
very
different
market
than
you
had.
you
have
a
market
comparable
to
what
you
had
before,
not
exactly,
but
you
would
have
a
comparable
market
with
two
significant
independent
spark
plug
manufacturers
and
only
one
of
the
big
three
automobile
companies
engaged
in
the
manufacture
of
spark
plugs.
the
--
our
economist
indicated
that
the
only
real
hope
of
ultimately
achieving
deconcentration
in
this
market
and
i
just
paused
to
point
out
that
in
a
market
of
this
type,
an
oligopolistic,
very
tightly
structured
market
with
high
barriers
to
entry,
no
price
competition,
it
is
vital
that
we
do
everything
in
the
hope
of
procuring
deconcentration.
every
step
that
may
lead
to
deconcentration,
may
lead
to
more
vigorous
competition
should
be
incurred.
the
only
hope
of
any
real
deconcentration
in
this
market
is
breaking
the
oe
tie.
that
is
trying
to
persuade
the
automobile
mechanics
that
really
they
do
not
have
to
use
the
original
equipment
plug.
now,
mr.
seymour
suggested
that
while
you
have
these
all
purpose
plugs,
they
are
really
not
quite
as
good.
the
average
service
station
or
a
garage
has
charts
would
show
substitutability
of
plugs
and
it
is
interesting
thing
that
ford’s
own
witness
testified
that
he
recognized
that
the
plugs
that
ford
makes,
they
all
make
--
all
three
of
them,
champion,
ford,
and
general
motors
that
is
autolite,
make
all
purpose
plugs
and
he
testifies
that
well
he
thought
that
the
ford
plugs
would
do
just
as
good
a
job
as
the
champion
in
the
ac
plugs
that
were
original
equipment
in
chrysler
and
general
motors
cars
and
he
was
asked
and
he
said
i
suppose
you
would
have
to
acknowledge
that
the
champion
in
ac
plugs
that
is
a
substitute
for
your
plugs
will
do
just
as
well,
and
he
said
well
yes.
evidence
for
example
shows
that
ford
was
much
elated
when
they
discovered
few
years
ago
that
at
some
trials,
automotive
trials
down
in
florida,
all
the
people
who
were
driving
the
stop
pontiac
(ph)
automobiles
were
using
electric
autolite
spark
plugs.
they
said,
this
just
shows
how
good
our
plugs
are
and
the
indication
is
that
the
real
hope,
the
real
hope
of
any
deconcentration
in
this
market
is
to
break
the
oe
tie
and
to
persuade
people
that
they
do
not
have
to
buy
the
original
equipment
plug
if
the
other
plug
would
have
--
and
of
course,
there
is
going
to
be
an
automobile
manufacturer
owning
a
spark
plug
firm.
it
is
going
to
be
much
less
likely
to
be
pushing
the
sales
of
the
private
brands
in
the
aftermarket
than
an
independent,
who
--
particularly
this
independent,
the
divested
company
that
knows
its
ultimate
future
may
depend
on
success
in
penetrating
into
the
aftermarket.
now,
ford
complains
about
the
requirement
that
it
purchased
its
half
of
its
need
from
autolite
because
it
says,
this
is
going
to
cause
also
some
problems
in
terms
of
pollution
control,
that
we
will
not
have
adequate
control
over
the
quality
of
the
plugs
and
this
is
going
to
be
very
unfortunate
that
we
can
do
a
much
better
job
ourselves.
well,
first
of
all,
the
decree
says
that
ford
in
purchasing
the
half
of
its
requirements
from
autolite
under
autolite’s
name
that
the
product
must
conform
to
ford’s
designs,
specifications,
quality
standards
and
delivery
requirements
and
to
be
priced
competitively.
so
that
ford
is
protected
because
the
decree
does
guarantee
it
and
the
requirements
are
contingent
on
the
plugs
meeting
those
standards.
moreover,
as
i
have
indicated
the
divested
company
will
be
under
very
great
pressure
to
satisfy
ford,
both
in
the
hope
of
getting
more
than
50%
of
the
business
and
in
the
hope
of
retaining
that
business
after
the
five
years.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
would
be
not
be
free
to
making
themselves,
but
it
seems
mr.
justice,
realistically,
considering
the
nature
of
the
relationship,
i
am
sure
the
divested
company
is
going
to
do
everything
it
can
to
meet
ford's
standards.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
the
record
shows
that
it
is
very
close
collaboration
between
the
independent
spark
plug
manufacturers,
prior
for
example
to
the
acquisition
ford
worked
very
closely
with
champion
and
they
worked
close
together.
it
seems
that
ford
for
50
years
was
fully
satisfied
with
the
product
it
was
getting
from
champion.
even
today,
chrysler
has
not
thus
far
attempted
to
integrate
and
there
is
no
indication
that
chrysler
is
not
getting
satisfactory
quality
and
there
is
not
--
no
indication
that
chrysler
is
not
able.
if
i
may,
mr.
justice
i
would
like
to
just
close
with
one
thought
if
i
may
which
is,
on
the
question
of
the
use
of
ford’s
own
trade
name
on
plugs.
ford
makes
the
point
that
this
is
a
harsh
remedy,
that
it
is
a
penalty,
that
it
is
unfair,
that
it
is
unnecessary
and
they
say
this
goes
far
beyond
anything
is
ever
happened
here
because
even
prior
to
the
acquisition.
ford
was
perfectly
free
at
anytime
to
manufacture
under
its
own
trade
name
and
now
it
its
precluded
and
i
think
the
answer
to
this
contention
is
something
that
this
court
stated
some
years
ago
in
federal
trade
commission
v.
national
lead
company
in
352
u.s.
when
the
complaint
was
there
made
that
a
decree
subjected
the
defendants
to
very
strict
strictures
and
was
unfair.
the
court
said
that
those
“violating
the
act”
must
expect
some
fencing
in.
i
think
ford
here
has
violated
the
act
through
this
acquisition
and
it
too
must
expect
some
fencing
in.
thank
you.
