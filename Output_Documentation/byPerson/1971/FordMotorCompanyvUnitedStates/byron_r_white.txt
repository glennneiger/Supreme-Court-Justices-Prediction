i
take
it
(inaudible)
indicated
a
while
ago
the
market
really
has
not
changed
much?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
has
not
become
anymore
competitive?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
it
remains
throughout
the
same
and
this
is
after
10
years?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
feel
things
might
have
been
worse?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
it
is
hard
to
pay
and
what
about
the
--
what
is
the
(inaudible)
is
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
aftermarket,
is
this
really
have
to
change
the
market
much,
it
does
not
make
much
difference
one
way
or
the
other,
whether
ford
does
or
does
not
own
the
company?
justice
byron
r.
white
perhaps
you
say
we
must
ignore
the
experience
of
10
years
in
some
cases,
perhaps
indicate
that
10
years
is
a
long
time
for
you
to
review
the
impact
of
the
market
and
using
to
indicators
is
much
impact
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
total
market
is
the
only
market?
justice
byron

white
champion
say,
it
would
sell
like
it
was
prior
arrangement
selling
85%
of
its
plugs
in
the
aftermarket.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
we
are
really
talking
about,
reasonabilities
about
(inaudible)
about
foreclosing
ford’s
share
50%.
what
part
does
ford
got
40%
of
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
we
are
talking
about
30%
of
15%
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that
but
ford
selling
in
the
aftermarket
does
not
foreclose
others
from
competing
for
the
aftermarket?
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
not
ford
may
or
may
have
a
lien
on
part
of
the
deal,
but
it
certainly
has
not
gone
all
the
people
who
are
dealing
of
cars
who
need
new
plugs
to
put
in
car?
justice
byron
r.
white
ford
cannot
foreclose
competitor
from
trying
to
sell
in
the
channel?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
how
much
of
that
market
do
you,
can
really
say
to
foreclose?
the
oe
market
is
only
15%
of
the
total
market.
ford's
share
that
is
only
a
third
that
is
5%
of
the
oe
market
that
is
foreclosed.
now,
how
much
percent
of
the
aftermarket
has
actually
been
foreclosed
by
ford's
acquisition
in
the
sense
that
places,
competitors
used
to
be
able
to
sell
in
and
they
could
no
longer
sell?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
that,
just
the
plant?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
name,
but
how
about
the
--
i
guess
ford
acquired
a
distribution
system?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
they
acquire
under
distribution?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
guess
divestiture
against
the
name
and
the
plant
is
going
to
be
a
new
company?
justice
byron
r.
white
capitalized
by
whom?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
company
is
getting
--
it
is
thinking
over
any
of
the
distribution
of
ford
--
justice
byron
r.
white
at
the
moment
they
cannot
make
spark
plugs
or
sell
under
ford
name?
justice
byron

white
what
is
meant
by
that
plant
being
(inaudible)

total

volume
is
how
much?
justice

as
a

justice
byron

white
yet
it
is
enjoined
from

justice

really
if
by

you
are
really
creating
one
more

there
(inaudible)
once
