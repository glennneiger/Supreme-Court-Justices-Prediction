mr.
richard
l.
goff
then
very
well,
your
honor
i
will
start
right
now.
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
it
please
the
court.
this
case
raises
one
issue
and
one
issue
only.
that
issue
is
whether
the
right
of
a
serviceman
to
petition
to
federal
court
for
habeas
corpus
based
on
the
wrongful,
and
i
claim,
of
wrongful
administrative
denial
of
his
applications
for
discharge
as
a
conscientious
objector
should
be
or
maybe
suspended
until
he
has
exhausted
certain
kinds
of
military
criminal
proceedings,
which
are
pending
against
him
at
the
time
the
habeas
petition
is
filed.
the
issue
arises
out
of
the
district
court’s
order
which
was
affirmed
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
in
order
that
all
proceedings
on
petitioner
parisi’s
petition
for
habeas
corpus
based
on
his
claim
that
the
army
had
denied
his
conscientious
objector
discharge
application
without
any
basis,
in
fact,
should
be
staid
until
exhaustion
of
military
criminal
proceedings,
which
were
pending
based
on
the
claim
of
refusal
to
obey
an
order
to
board
a
plane
headed
for
vietnam.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
under
the
district
court’s
order
your
honor.
the
exhaustion
remedy
must
be
pursued
until
there
has
been
a
final
judgment
in
the
military
criminal
proceedings.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
i
would
assume
that
if
there
were,
if
the
conviction
were
affirmed
in
the
court
of
military
review
that
that
would
certainly
necessitate
continuing
the
appeal
process
through
the
court
of
military
appeals.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
as
i
understand
it
your
honor,
after
the
judgment
of
conviction
and
the
sentence,
there
is
a
certain
process
of
review
by
the
convening
authority
which
can
take
a
certain
period
of
time
several,
weeks
or
few
months
--
mr.
richard
l.
goff
i
am
not
certain
your
honor
of
the
exact
time
with
it.
after
the
convening
authority
completes
his
review
then
the
case
maybe
and
was
in
this
case
appealed
to
the
court
of
military
review.
the
record
is
lodged
in
the
court
of
military
review,
briefs
are
filed,
the
case
is
argued
although
in
this
case
oral
argument
has
been
waived.
there
is
a
decision
and
if
the
decision
is
adverse
to
the
defendant
then
i
would
certainly
read
the
district
court’s
order
as
requiring
further
exhaustion
by
an
appeal
to
the
court
of
military
appeals.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
as
i
understand
it
that
is
an
appeal
of
right,
although
i
am
not
thoroughly
familiar
with
that
particular
aspect
of
it.
it
also
seems
that
an
additional
exhaustion
requirement
is
imposed
by
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
below
although
perhaps
not
adhered
to
by
the
solicitor
general
whose
brief
in
the
case
of
barr
namely
a
petition
to
the
court
of
military
appeals
for
extraordinary
post
conviction
habeas
corpus
supposedly
discharging
the
man
from
the
service.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
your
honor
the
--
the
ninth
circuit
justified
the
entire
exhaustion
process
--
mr.
richard
l.
goff
your
honor,
under
the
district
court’s
order
i
believe
it
could
be
argued,
that
the
step
could
not
--
does
not
have
to
be
exhausted.
however,
under
the
ninth
circuit’s
opinion
referring
that
order
it
appears
that
it
might
well
have
to
be
exhausted
because
really
that
is
the
only
way
the
court
of
the
ninth
circuit
that
the
man
could
ever
obtain
from
the
military
process
the
right
to
discharge
which
he
seeks
on
erroneous
--
mr.
richard
l.
goff
your
honor
the
man
was
and
has
been
incarcerated
until
recently
when
--
mr.
richard
l.
goff
i
am
not
certain
your
honor.
i
assume
--
mr.
richard
l.
goff
no,
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
well,
the
attempt
your
honor
was
an
order
transferring
them
to
vietnam.
the
contemplation
was
that
he
would
have
been
engaged
in
psychological
counseling
in
vietnam.
he
refused
the
order
and
as
his
affidavit
in
the
district
court
states
for
him
that
order
raised
incompatible
conflict
of
his
beliefs
because
it
would
put
him
in
a
position
where
he
was
much
more
likely
involved.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
no.
the
petitioner
as
we
mentioned
in
our
reply
brief,
we
got
the
news
just
after
we
filed
our
original
brief,
has
been
--
the
remainder
of
his
confinement
has
been
remitted.
he
still
arraigns
in
the
army
on
an
excess
leave
status.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
well,
as
far
as
i
can
understand
your
honor
it
means
that
he
is
still
subject
to
military
jurisdiction
according
--
mr.
richard
l.
goff
i
would
think
that
he
is
at
home
in
connecticut,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
well
your
honor
for
one
--
mr.
richard
l.
goff
for
one
reason
the
dishonorable
discharge
was
part
of
the
sentence
and
therefore
i
assume
that
the
military
appellant
proceeding
would
go
on
in
that
connection.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
i
think
that
he
served
about
--
well
after
the
conviction
he
served
i
think
about
14
months
of
his
sentence.
he
was
also
incarcerated
for
4
months
after
the
charges
were
first
lodged
until
the
trail.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
i
think
so
your
honor.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
the
sentence
i
think
was
two
years
at
hard
labor
and
also
dishonorable
discharge.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
approximately
months
have
been
remitted.
that
is
correct.
your
honor
we
believe
that
the
importance
of
the
rights
which
petitioner
sought
and
still
seeks
to
have
indicated
in
federal
court
are
undeniable.
i
think
this
court
has
recognized
in
many
occasion
the
importance
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
as
the
means
of
securing
prompt
and
speedy
and
effective
relief
against
unlawful
restraints
on
personal
freedom.
it
has
become
also
the
accepted
means
of
seeking
judicial
review
of
asserted
wrongful
denial
of
applications
for
discharge
of
conscientious
objectors.
i
think
it
is
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
when
the
serviceman
seeks
the
writ
on
that
basis,
he
is
seeking
relief
from
action
of
the
military
which
has
violated
his
constitutional
right
of
due
process.
he
is
also
seeking
relief
which
will
protect
his
religious
beliefs,
the
liberty
of
his
conscience,
interests
which
this
court
has
also
recognized
are
been
of
very
fundamental
importance
in
a
free
society.
an
essential
element
of
the
remedy
of
habeas
corpus
also
has
been
its
recognition
that
it
is
a
prompt
and
swift
means
for
obtaining
judicial
review.
and
certainly
in
the
case
of
military
personnel
whose
duration
of
their
enlistment
is
necessary
limited.
if
a
conscientious
objector
has
had
his
application
denied
without
basis
in
fact
only
through
prompt
intervention.
only
through
prompt
access
to
the
federal
court
to
give
him
the
review
of
the
wrongfulness
of
the
military
denial
of
the
claim.
only
in
that
way
can
he
secure
the
relief
which
will
carry
out
the
policy
which
is
even
recognize
by
military’s
own
regulation
that
it
is
more
essential
to
respect
the
man’s
religious
beliefs
than
to
force
him
to
continue
serving
in
the
military
in
violation
of
those
beliefs.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
your
honor
the
basic
question
now
before
the
court
goes
to
the
right,
the
basic
right
to
get
federal
review
of
the
claim
in
the
federal
court
on
the
merits
for
the
claim.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
in
the
federal
district
court.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
of
the
claim
of
his
administrate
--
and
his
administrative
--
that
the
administrative
denial
of
his
application
was
without
basis
in
fact
and
denial
due
process.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
now
the
issue
of
exactly
what
kind
of
relief
the
district
court
might
or
might
not
grant.
i
do
not
think
it
is
presently
before
this
court.
it
is
been
recognized
by
many
decisions
including
the
recent
ninth
circuit
decision
in
racher
v.
mcdamera
(ph)
that
even
if,
for
example
the
court
did
not
feel
that
it
could
direct
the
immediate
release
to
the
petitioner,
at
the
very
least
he
has
a
right
to
a
hearing
and
a
determination
on
the
merits
of
his
claim
and
under
the
habeas
corpus
statute
the
court
shall
then
dispose
the
cases
as
law
and
justice
required.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
that
would
be
primarily
a
question
of
military
law
and
for
the
military
court
to
decide.
well,
i
am
not
--
mr.
richard
l.
goff
excuse
me.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
yeah,
i
certainly
think
that
in
a
subsequent
court-martial
proceeding
a
strong
argument
could
be
made
that
such
a
determination
was
res
judicata.
certainly
i
think
the
effect
of
the
district
court,
that
the
district
court
were
to
give
him
the
hearing
on
the
merits
and
were
to
make
the
decision
that
his
application
have
been
denied
without
any
basis
in
fact
and
thus
in
violation
of
his
rights
of
due
process.
that
would
be
determination
that
he
has
a
right
to
discharge
as
a
conscientious
objector
and
i
think
that
a
strong
argument
could
be
made
either
for
the
proposition
that
he
has
a
right
to
discharge
which
deprives
the
military
of
jurisdiction.
indeed
the
solicitor
general’s
own
brief
seems
to
concede
as
much
by
the
reference
in
the
analogy
to
army
regulation
635-200,
or
at
least
for
the
more
limited
proposition
which
several
of
the
district
courts
have
been
adopting
in
their
discharge
orders.
but
at
least
he
ought
to
be
put
in
the
same
position
as
he
would
have
been
in
if
the
military
had
granted
his
application
for
discharge
rather
than
denied
it.
and
this
again
i
think
it
is
something
which
is
recognized
by
the
government’s
own
brief,
in
their
footnote
34
where
they
point
out
the
distinction
between
the
type
of
order
that
the
military
might
give
a
man
even
while
they
are
processing
him
out
such
as
in
order
to
put
on
a
uniform.
and
in
those
circumstances
the
government,
the
man
would
not
be
excuse
from
disobeying
the
order
and
presumably
would
have
to
go
through
the
court-martial
process
anyway.
on
the
other
hand
the
order
which
assigns
him
to
some
new
duty
station
is
an
order
which
clearly
the
military
would
not
have
given
him
if
the
secretary
of
the
army
had
granted
his
application
for
discharge
as
a
conscientious
objector
and
if
the
military
would
not
and
could
not
have
given
him
that
order
then
i
think
it
would
be
quite
proper
for
the
district
court
to
say
that
the
right
of
discharge
shall
be
recognized
now
and
shall
supersede
any
court-martial,
pending
court-martial
proceedings.
certainly
that
is
not
so
surprising
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
military
itself
seems
to
recognize
that
such
an
order
would
be
unlawful.
if
it
was
an
order
which
ordered
the
man
to
a
new
duty
station
and
followed
or
was
depended
upon
a
wrongful
denial
of
a
conscientious
objector
application.
i
think
that
once
the
district
court
has
made
the
basic
determination
that
the
military
denial
of
his
claim
was
wrongful
without
basis
in
fact
and
he
is
entitled
for
discharge
as
a
conscientious
objector,
it
then
certainly
has
the
power
to
inquire
into
the
legality
of
the
man’s
continued
detention.
sort
of
like
the
basic
purpose
the
writ
requiring
the
jailer
to
justify
the
legality
of
the
detention.
and
in
no
circumstances
if
the
government
wish
to
claim
that
the
continued
detention
was
justified
by
subsequent
events
then
i
think
the
court
could
certainly
inquire
in
the
validity
of
that
particular
claim.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
trying
to
pick
up
where
we
left
off
yesterday.
the
government
has
pointed
out
in
its
brief
that
the
various
branches
of
the
armed
services
have
promulgated
regulations,
which
provide
for
an
elaborate
administrative
review
machinery
of
conscientious
objector
application.
now,
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
in
cases
like
a
petitioner
has
already
completed
an
exhausted
that
elaborate
administrative
review
of
machinery.
it
is
important
to
focus
on
the
fact
that
his
habeas
corpus
petition
challenges
and
seeks
review
of
the
validity
of
that
administrative
determination.
it
is
not
a
situation
like
was
present
in
the
gusik
case
or
the
case
of
noyd
v.
bond,
which
the
petitioner
in
habeas
corpus.
and,
the
petitioner
was
brought
to
challenge
and
seek
review
of
alleged
invalidity
or
asserted
errors
in
the
military
criminal
proceedings
which
were
pending
against
the
petitioner.
here,
on
the
other
hand,
the
petitioner
asserts
in
court
a
right
to
discharge
of
the
conscientious
objector,
which
right
is
independent
of
those
criminal
proceeding.
it
is
not
depended
on
any
invalidity
of
those
proceedings.
but,
rather
it
arises
from
the
wrongful
administrative
denial
of
his
application
for
discharges
of
conscientious
objector
without
basis
and
fact.
so
the
government’s
reliance
on
the
exhaustion
of
court-martial
that
was
required
in
noyd
v.
bond
and
in
gusik
v.
shilder.
we
believe
it
is
completely
inapplicable
and
i
think
the
government
itself
recognized
this
only
two
years
ago.
in
a
memorandum,
which
the
solicitor
general
submitted
to
this
court
in
the
case
of
craycroft
v.
ferrall,
a
memorandum
which
we
were
not
able
to
discover
until
yesterday
that
in
clerk's
office.
but,
in
that
particular
case
the
department
--
the
solicitor
general
stated
very
specifically
department
of
justice
had
determined
to
withdraw
its
support
of
the
position
previously
urged
in
the
brief
in
our
position
in
noyd
v.
mcnamara
that
military
judicial
remedies
must
be
exhausted
before
resort
by
a
serviceman
with
conscientious
objector
claims
to
civilian
courts.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
i
think
the
government’s
brief,
as
i
recall
refers
to
the
craycroft
situation
as
one
in
which
the
government
at
that
time
withdrew
its
insistence
that
--
or
any
reliance
on
the
proposition
that
a
conscientious
objector
applicant
must
resort
to
the
military
correction
boards
before
seeking
review
in
a
federal
courts.
i
would
like
to
continue
quoting,
if
i
may
from
--
mr.
richard
l.
goff
well,
i
do
not
think
it
is
in
the
appendix
or
in
the
appendix
to
the
government’s
brief
your
honor.
what
it
is
in
the
memorandum
of
the
solicitor
general
in
craycroft
v.
ferrall
number
718
miscellaneous
october
23,
1969
and
in
that
memorandum
the
solicitor
general
stated
that
nothing
in
this
policy
undermines
the
general
rule
urged
by
the
government
and
adopted
by
this
court
in
noyd
v.
bond
that
military
prisoners
must
ordinarily
exhaust
all
available
remedies
within
the
particular
service
before
seeking
review
on
a
habeas
corpus
petition
in
a
federal
civilian
court.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
the
application
in
this
particular
case,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
parisi
case?
mr.
richard
l.
goff
well,
in
the
parisi
case--
mr.
richard
l.
goff
the
administrative
process
has
been
completely
exhausted.
parisi
had
even
exhausted
the
requirement
for
the
ninth
circuit
was
then
imposing
of
also
applying
to
the
army
board
for
correction
of
military
records.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
beyond
that
he
can
go
nowhere
within
the
administrative
process
and
under
accepted
doctrine
of
the
federal
courts
he
has
the
right
to
come
in
to
the
court
on
habeas
corpus
to
review
the
validity
of
that
administrative
denial.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
on
a
conviction,
the
case
is
presently
under
submission
for
the
court
of
military
review.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
the
conviction
referring,
he
would
have
an
appeal
--
i
understand
that
there
is
not
as
a
right,
but
at
least
to
right
to
seek
in
appeal
from
the
court
of
the
military
appeals.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
that
is
my
understanding
your
honor,
yes.
the
department
of
justice
did
say,
and
this
is
the
key
point
into
this
last
memorandum.
it
is
simply
our
view
shared
by
the
department
of
defense
that
resort
to
court’s
marshall
should
not
be
required
before
we
do
judicial
review
of
a
conscientious
objector
claim
can
be
obtained.
now,
i
recognized
the
right
of
the
government
to
change
its
mind.
but,
i
really
think
they
were
right
the
first
time,
because
i
would
submit
that
the
exhaustion
requirement,
which
they
would
now
seek
to
impose,
that
is
the
demand
exhaust
military
criminal
proceedings
against
him.
in
the
first
place
serves
none
of
the
purposes,
which
underlie
the
exhaustion
requirement,
as
it
has
been
previously
been
developed
by
this
court.
the
government
has
conceded
that
requiring
resort
to
court-martial
remedy
would
not
serve
any
purpose
of
allowing
an
administrative
agency
or
the
military
tribunal
to
develop
a
fact
record,
to
exercise
administrative
discretion,
to
apply
any
expertise
to
factual
questions
or
even
to
special
questions
of
military
law.
such
was
--
as
was
also
emphasized
by
this
court
in
noyd
v.
bond.
furthermore,
the
requiring
resort
to
court-martial
on
this
here,
it
is
not
necessary
to
avoid
a
judicial
intrusion
into
--
or
judicial
intrusion
upon
or
preemption
of
an
agency
to
which
either
congress
or
the
military
has
confided
the
primary
responsibility
for
deciding
or
reviewing
the
basic
question,
which
is
now
being
presented
to
the
federal
court.
the
agency
was
responsible
to
decide
that
question.
that
is
the
secretary
of
the
army
has
already
decided
it
and
we
now
seek
in
federal
court,
the
review
of
that
particular
determination,
so
there
is
no
effort
here
to
disrupt
the
administrative
decision
making
scheme,
which
has
been
set
up
by
the
statute.
in
fact,
if
the
government
were
serious
about
the
claim
that
exhaustion
is
necessary
to
avoid
conflict
with
the
military
or
to
allow
the
military
to
correct
its
own
errors.
then,
i
would
have
thought
that
the
government
would
have
continued
to
insist
that
a
serviceman
appealed
to
the
army
board
for
correction
of
the
military
records
after
the
secretary
of
the
army
has
denied
his
claim
for
conscientious
objection.
but,
as
we
know
in
craycroft
the
government
expressly
conceded
that
such
appeal
was
not
necessary
and
followed
the
brooks
versus
clifford
decision,
which
held
that
you
require
a
petitioner
to
undergo
the
delay
some
four
months
going
to
that
kind
of
a
board
would
work
really
intolerable
interference
with
his
right
to
come
into
court
and
have
access
to
the
court
on
habeas
corpus
for
swift
review
of
the
validity
of
the
administrative
denial
of
its
conscientious
objection
claims.
finally,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
exhaustion
requirements
was
the
government
lives
assert
here
would
operate
in
a
very
random
hit
or
miss
and
rather
discriminatory
manner.
for
example,
obviously
resort
to
court-martial
on
this
would
not
be
required
in
those
cases
and
we
sited
some
in
our
brief
as
examples,
where
after
the
administrative
denial
of
the
conscientious
objector
application
is
taken
place,
the
military
itself
chooses
not
to
insist
on
ordering
a
man
to
a
new
duty
assignment
or
revokes
pending
orders.
so,
that
the
man
can
come
into
court
and
present
his
habeas
corpus
petition.
nor
would
be
applicable
where
in
cases,
and
we
have
also
cited
examples,
where
although
a
military
defense
had
been
committed
and
the
military
and
its
discretion
decides
not
to
press
the
charges.
furthermore,
the
government
has
conceded
that
it
would
be
applicable
under
its
standard
only
in
those
cases
where
the
court-martial
might
be
willing
to
entertain
the
defense.
and
this
results
in
some
rather
perverse
distinction
because
apparently
means
that
the
right
of
quick
federal
review
on
habeas
corpus
would
be
available
to
the
man
who
jumps
the
gun
and
commits
the
military
offense,
before
his
application
for
field
discharge
has
been
finally
processed
and
denied,
but
would
not
be
available
to
the
man
who
waits
until
after
it
is
denied
and
then
commits
this
offense.
similarly,
if
apparently
would
be
available
to
the
man
who
disobeys
a
simple
order,
such
as
to
put
on
your
uniform
or
to
cut
the
weeds
behind
the
post
building.
but,
apparently
would
not
be
available
and
the
writ
would
be
suspended
as
to
someone
who
disobeys
a
more
serious
order,
such
as
to
go
to
vietnam.
and
what
it
all
boils
down
to,
i
think
is
that
the
army’s
denial
of
the
application
could
be
completely
without
basis
in
fact.
totally
wrongful
and
the
man
would
have
a
clear
right
to
come
into
federal
court
on
habeas
corpus
to
get
released
and
yet
a
military
commander,
by
subsequently
giving
that
man
an
order
of
a
particular
kind.
apparently,
a
rather
major
kind
and
then
going
ahead
and
prosecuting
a
man
for
the
disobedience
of
that
order,
could
effectively
bring
about
a
suspension
of
the
right
to
go
to
federal
court.
but,
now,
of
the
course,
the
man
could
obey
the
order
and
then
apparently
he
would
not
--
his
right
would
not
be
suspended.
i
think
that
only
demonstrates
another
perverse
aspect
of
the
exhaustion
requirement
which
the
government
seeks
to
require.
namely
that
operates
most
harshly
on
those
whose
conscientious
objector
convictions
are
most
sincere,
because
in
this
case
for
example
if
parisi
has
been
willing
to
compromise,
what
he
felt
were
his
conscientious
objector
beliefs
and
obeyed
this
particular
order,
then
under
the
government’s
position
and
under
the
court
of
appeals
position
he
would
been
able
to
come
into
court
and
according
to
both
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
government
it
seems
quite
likely
in
this
record
that
he
would
have
received
a
relief
on
the
merit
that
he
was
seeking.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
that
is
correct
and
it
is
consistent
with
those
tentative
conclusions.
but,
i
think
that
if
we
were
to
say,
first
of
all
what
we
were
trying
to
do
at
that
particular
time
was
to
get
either
the
district
judge
or
the
circuit
justices
or
justice
douglas
to
exercise
discretionary
power
to
grant
temporary
injunctive
relief,
which
obviously
depends
on
several
factors
such
as
the
likelihood
of
success
on
the
merits,
of
balancing
the
conveniences
in
determination,
whether
there
is
other
adequate
relief
and
to
say,
that
our
failure
to
get
that
relief
before
there
had
been
any
kind
of
determination
on
the
merits
of
his
conscientious
objector
claim,
should
later
operate
in
effect
to
bar
him
from
getting
into
court
to
review
the
merits
of
that
claim.
i
think
would
be
totally
anomalous,
i
think
justice
douglas
in
his
own
decision
said,
if
it
were
clear
that
applicant
would
win
on
the
merits
or
further
protective
order
at
this
time
would
be
appropriate.
well,
it
was
not
clear
at
that
time.
but,
i
submit
that
the
failure
to
get
temporary
relief
should
not
operate.
first,
to
bar
the
man
from
eventually
coming
into
court
and
having
his
claim
as
conscientious
objector
determined
on
the
merits.
furthermore--
mr.
richard
l.
goff
you
honor,
i
realized
that
those
with
the
tentative
conclusions
of
the
justices
who
passed
on
the
application,
i
would
submit
that
no
one
other
than
mr.
parisi
himself
could
finally
make
the
determination
as
to
whether
that
order
did
in
fact
violate
his
conscientious
objector
beliefs.
he
has
stated
in
an
application
--
mr.
richard
l.
goff
well,
apparently
in
that
case
the
government
would
concede
that
since
the
defense
of
conscientious
objection
or
wrongful
denial
of
conscientious
objector
application
would
not
be
entertained
by
the
court-martial,
that
the
man
would
have
a
perfect
right
to
come
into
federal
court
and
have
the
administrative
denial
of
his
application
reviewed.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
alright,
all
i
am
suggesting
your
honor
is
that
the
basic
thing
that
(voice
overlap)
mr.
richard
l.
goff
i
would
give
you
an
answer
for
that
question.
the
basic
thing
that
we
think
that
a
man
has
the
right
to
under
any
circumstances,
regardless
of
the
pending
military
criminal
proceedings
against
him
is
a
right
to
immediate
review
in
the
federal
court
of
the
wrongfulness
or
the
validity
of
the
administrative
denial
of
his
conscientious
objector
application.
now,
if
the
court
does
make
the
incrimination,
if
the
application
would
deny
that
basis
in
fact,
then
we
would
say
that
the
question
of
what
kind
of
relief
the
district
court
is
to
grant
after
having
made
that
determination
and
if
the
court
for
example
would
have
found
that
it
is
quite
clear
that
an
order
to
a
new
duty
assignment
would
not
had
been
given
to
the
man,
had
the
military
originally
granted
his
application,
as
it
should
have
done,
then
i
think
it
would
be
quite
arguable
to
district
court
that
the
right
of
discharge
ought
to
be
recognized
and
should
cut
across
in
the
military
criminal
prosecution.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
district
court
found
that
the
man
disobeyed
an
order
which
the
court--or
which
the
army
could
have
given
to
him,
even
while
they
were
processing
him
out,
is
the
distinction
that
suggested
by
the
government
by
itself
also,
i
might
add--then
the
court
might
well
say,
the
right
to
discharge
shall
be
recognized.
but,
it
shall
be
subject
to
the
military
prosecution
against
him.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
i
think
that
is
a
perfectly
sensible
resolution
of
this
particular
problem.
i
think
our
brief
discusses
also,
the
fact
that
in
addition
to
the
government's
failure
to
show
any
compelling
government
interest,
supporting
the
suspension
of
the
right
to
habeas
corpus
in
this
case,
they
have
also
completely
failed
to
show
either
an
available
or
adequate
remedy
to
seek
the
kind
of
relief
the
petitioner
does
seek
in
the
district
court
and
for
the
reason
stated
in
brief
and
today
in
oral
arguments,
we
respectfully
request
that
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
be
reversed
and
the
case
be
remanded.
so,
the
petitioner
finally
can
have
his
day
in
court
on
the
merits
of
his
claim.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
yes,
i
would
your
honor.
i
would
make
the
same
argument
that
the
right
to
come
into
court,
to
have
the
court
review
the
wrongfulness
of
the
denial
of
the
discharge
application
should
be
recognized
right
now.
and,
that
the
question
of
what
to
do
about
that
prosecution
for
stealing
the
car
is
the
question
which
pertains
to
the
relief
of
the
district
court
is
going
to
grant.
i
think
that
the
ninth
circuit
is
quite
clearly
recognized
that
in
its
recent
bacher
v.
makimer
(ph)
of
the
mcnamara
case,
cited
in
our
reply
brief
which
said
that
even
if
the
right
to
discharge
would
not
be
immediate
that
the
court
should
immediately
review
the
underlying
claim
of
the
wrongfulness
of
denial
of
conscientious
objector
application
and
then
under
the
habeas
corpus
statute
should
impose
the
case--
mr.
richard
l.
goff
well,
i
think
at
the
right
starting
court
of
course
is
the
right
to
-
-an
order
directing
the
army
to
discharge
and
has
the
conscientious
objector.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
i
think
again,
this
is
a
kind
of
question
that
the
court
could
get
into
determining
what
relief
to
give
a
man.
i
think
that
as
the
ninth
circuit
had
said
the
court
shall
make
the
basic
determination
on
the
merits
and
shall
then
dispose
off
the
case
on
just
as
required.
i
think
that
we
can
allow
our
district
judges
to
adopt
appropriate
remedies
to
take
into
account
these
varying
circumstances
which
might
come
up.
the
basic
right
to
review
is
what
we
seek
in
this
court.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
thank
your
honor.
counsel
has
said
that
the
only
question
here
is
when
can
petitioner
get
access
to
the
federal
court
on
habeas
corpus
to
review
his
claim.
the
petitioner
on
may
22,
1969
first
submitted
to
the
army
his
application
for
a
discharge
of
the
conscientious
objector.
the
processing
of
that
application
continued
until
november
1969
when
it
was
denied.
it
was
after
that
the
petitioner
tried
to
come
into
federal
court
and
secure
the
swift,
prompt
adjudication
of
the
legality
of
the
contention
which
is
contemplated
by
the
habeas
corpus
statute.
the
delay
is
incident
to
requiring
resort
to
the
court-martial
process
would
be
several
months
before
trial
for
in
this
case.
several
months
until
such
time,
the
court
of
military
review
can
review
the
case.
i
realize
at
that
time,
it
is
perhaps
more
in
this
case
than
it
usually
be.
but,
in
many
cases
cited
by
the
governments,
the
delay
has
been
at
least
a
year
from
the
court-martial
until
review
by
the
court
of
military
review
and
in
our
view
and
of
course,
beyond
that
to
the
court
of
military
appeals
and
only
if
the
court
of
military
appeals
point
if
it
all
can
the
petitioner
ever
get
the
discharge,
which
he
seeks
in
the
federal
court
promptly.
and,
it
is
very
doubtful
in
our
view
that
if
he
ever
did
get
a
discharge.
administrative
discharge
is
result
of
the
court-martial
process.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
in
this
case
those
procedures
were
completed
by
november
1969.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
the
habeas
was
filed
almost
immediately,
but
that
was
suspended,
because
under
the
--
mr.
richard
l.
goff
the
habeas
was
filed
late
in
november
1969.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
that
was
in
december
of
1969.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
after
the
filling
of
the
habeas
corpus
petition.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
that
is
correct
and
it
was
not
until
the
denial
by
the
army
board
for
correction
of
military
records,
that
under
the
ninth
circuit's
view
at
that
time,
he
was
able
to
comeback
in
the
federal
court
to
seek
review
on
the
merits
and
it
was
that
time
he
was
meant
by
the
government's
stay
in
motion.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
at
that
time
and
until
very
recently
in
their
bacher
versus
makimer
(ph)
opinion,
the
ninth
circuit
required
the
serviceman,
even
after
denial
by
the
secretary
of
the
army
to
go
on
appeal
to
the
army
board
for
correction.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
that
is
correct,
because
ironically
the
military
regulation
(voice
overlap)
mr.
richard
l.
goff
i
think
the
charges
had
been
lodged
and
the
petitioner
was
incarcerated
into
stockade.
the
trial
did
not
occur--incidentally
the
trial
did
not
occur
until
after
district
court’s
order
in
this
case,
so
certainly
at
the
time
of
the
district
court’s
order,
the
petitioner
was
not
at
that
time
advancing
this
defense
in
the
court-martial
proceeding.
i
think
it
would
have
been
extremely
imprudent
for
him
to
fail
to
do
so,
under
to
the
terms
of
district
courts
order.
but
again,
the
whole
possibility--
mr.
richard
l.
goff
the
charges
had
been
preferred.
the
trial
took
place
shortly
after
district
court's
order
staying
these
particular
proceeding.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
court-martial
conviction,
as
i
recall
would
be
april
of
1970.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
there
has
been
some
delay,
your
honor
is
the
result
of
extension
in
the
time
sought
by
petitioner's
counsel.
we
do
not
represent,
but
he
does
have
other
counsel,
who
had
sought
extensions.
but,
even
absence
of
those
extensions,
it
seems
to
us
just
looking
at
many
cases,
the
government
had
decided,
an
11
to
12
month
delay
is
not
unusual
at
all.
and,
we
think
that
that
kind
of
delay
is
completely
inconsistent
with
the
purpose
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
i
understand
that
the
extensions
were
sought
on
the
ground
that
he
simply
had
not
any
time
yet
to
complete
the
brief
and
to
present
it
to
the
court.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
no
is
not.
the
case
is
under
submission,
petitioner’s
counsel
did
waive
oral
argument,
so
the
case
is
under
submission
i
think
for
two
months
and
the
letter
in
the
appendix
estimates
that
september
at
least
--
i
am
sorry
as
of
an
earlier
time,
two
to
four
months
delay
could
be
expected.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
then
very
well,
your
honor
i
will
start
right
now.
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
it
please
the
court.
this
case
raises
one
issue
and
one
issue
only.
that
issue
is
whether
the
right
of
a
serviceman
to
petition
to
federal
court
for
habeas
corpus
based
on
the
wrongful,
and
i
claim,
of
wrongful
administrative
denial
of
his
applications
for
discharge
as
a
conscientious
objector
should
be
or
maybe
suspended
until
he
has
exhausted
certain
kinds
of
military
criminal
proceedings,
which
are
pending
against
him
at
the
time
the
habeas
petition
is
filed.
the
issue
arises
out
of
the
district
court’s
order
which
was
affirmed
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
in
order
that
all
proceedings
on
petitioner
parisi’s
petition
for
habeas
corpus
based
on
his
claim
that
the
army
had
denied
his
conscientious
objector
discharge
application
without
any
basis,
in
fact,
should
be
staid
until
exhaustion
of
military
criminal
proceedings,
which
were
pending
based
on
the
claim
of
refusal
to
obey
an
order
to
board
a
plane
headed
for
vietnam.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
under
the
district
court’s
order
your
honor.
the
exhaustion
remedy
must
be
pursued
until
there
has
been
a
final
judgment
in
the
military
criminal
proceedings.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
i
would
assume
that
if
there
were,
if
the
conviction
were
affirmed
in
the
court
of
military
review
that
that
would
certainly
necessitate
continuing
the
appeal
process
through
the
court
of
military
appeals.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
as
i
understand
it
your
honor,
after
the
judgment
of
conviction
and
the
sentence,
there
is
a
certain
process
of
review
by
the
convening
authority
which
can
take
a
certain
period
of
time
several,
weeks
or
few
months
--
mr.
richard
l.
goff
i
am
not
certain
your
honor
of
the
exact
time
with
it.
after
the
convening
authority
completes
his
review
then
the
case
maybe
and
was
in
this
case
appealed
to
the
court
of
military
review.
the
record
is
lodged
in
the
court
of
military
review,
briefs
are
filed,
the
case
is
argued
although
in
this
case
oral
argument
has
been
waived.
there
is
a
decision
and
if
the
decision
is
adverse
to
the
defendant
then
i
would
certainly
read
the
district
court’s
order
as
requiring
further
exhaustion
by
an
appeal
to
the
court
of
military
appeals.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
as
i
understand
it
that
is
an
appeal
of
right,
although
i
am
not
thoroughly
familiar
with
that
particular
aspect
of
it.
it
also
seems
that
an
additional
exhaustion
requirement
is
imposed
by
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
below
although
perhaps
not
adhered
to
by
the
solicitor
general
whose
brief
in
the
case
of
barr
namely
a
petition
to
the
court
of
military
appeals
for
extraordinary
post
conviction
habeas
corpus
supposedly
discharging
the
man
from
the
service.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
your
honor
the
--
the
ninth
circuit
justified
the
entire
exhaustion
process
--
mr.
richard
l.
goff
your
honor,
under
the
district
court’s
order
i
believe
it
could
be
argued,
that
the
step
could
not
--
does
not
have
to
be
exhausted.
however,
under
the
ninth
circuit’s
opinion
referring
that
order
it
appears
that
it
might
well
have
to
be
exhausted
because
really
that
is
the
only
way
the
court
of
the
ninth
circuit
that
the
man
could
ever
obtain
from
the
military
process
the
right
to
discharge
which
he
seeks
on
erroneous
--
mr.
richard
l.
goff
your
honor
the
man
was
and
has
been
incarcerated
until
recently
when
--
mr.
richard
l.
goff
i
am
not
certain
your
honor.
i
assume
--
mr.
richard
l.
goff
no,
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
well,
the
attempt
your
honor
was
an
order
transferring
them
to
vietnam.
the
contemplation
was
that
he
would
have
been
engaged
in
psychological
counseling
in
vietnam.
he
refused
the
order
and
as
his
affidavit
in
the
district
court
states
for
him
that
order
raised
incompatible
conflict
of
his
beliefs
because
it
would
put
him
in
a
position
where
he
was
much
more
likely
involved.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
no.
the
petitioner
as
we
mentioned
in
our
reply
brief,
we
got
the
news
just
after
we
filed
our
original
brief,
has
been
--
the
remainder
of
his
confinement
has
been
remitted.
he
still
arraigns
in
the
army
on
an
excess
leave
status.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
well,
as
far
as
i
can
understand
your
honor
it
means
that
he
is
still
subject
to
military
jurisdiction
according
--
mr.
richard
l.
goff
i
would
think
that
he
is
at
home
in
connecticut,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
well
your
honor
for
one
--
mr.
richard
l.
goff
for
one
reason
the
dishonorable
discharge
was
part
of
the
sentence
and
therefore
i
assume
that
the
military
appellant
proceeding
would
go
on
in
that
connection.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
i
think
that
he
served
about
--
well
after
the
conviction
he
served
i
think
about
14
months
of
his
sentence.
he
was
also
incarcerated
for
4
months
after
the
charges
were
first
lodged
until
the
trail.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
i
think
so
your
honor.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
the
sentence
i
think
was
two
years
at
hard
labor
and
also
dishonorable
discharge.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
approximately
months
have
been
remitted.
that
is
correct.
your
honor
we
believe
that
the
importance
of
the
rights
which
petitioner
sought
and
still
seeks
to
have
indicated
in
federal
court
are
undeniable.
i
think
this
court
has
recognized
in
many
occasion
the
importance
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
as
the
means
of
securing
prompt
and
speedy
and
effective
relief
against
unlawful
restraints
on
personal
freedom.
it
has
become
also
the
accepted
means
of
seeking
judicial
review
of
asserted
wrongful
denial
of
applications
for
discharge
of
conscientious
objectors.
i
think
it
is
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
when
the
serviceman
seeks
the
writ
on
that
basis,
he
is
seeking
relief
from
action
of
the
military
which
has
violated
his
constitutional
right
of
due
process.
he
is
also
seeking
relief
which
will
protect
his
religious
beliefs,
the
liberty
of
his
conscience,
interests
which
this
court
has
also
recognized
are
been
of
very
fundamental
importance
in
a
free
society.
an
essential
element
of
the
remedy
of
habeas
corpus
also
has
been
its
recognition
that
it
is
a
prompt
and
swift
means
for
obtaining
judicial
review.
and
certainly
in
the
case
of
military
personnel
whose
duration
of
their
enlistment
is
necessary
limited.
if
a
conscientious
objector
has
had
his
application
denied
without
basis
in
fact
only
through
prompt
intervention.
only
through
prompt
access
to
the
federal
court
to
give
him
the
review
of
the
wrongfulness
of
the
military
denial
of
the
claim.
only
in
that
way
can
he
secure
the
relief
which
will
carry
out
the
policy
which
is
even
recognize
by
military’s
own
regulation
that
it
is
more
essential
to
respect
the
man’s
religious
beliefs
than
to
force
him
to
continue
serving
in
the
military
in
violation
of
those
beliefs.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
your
honor
the
basic
question
now
before
the
court
goes
to
the
right,
the
basic
right
to
get
federal
review
of
the
claim
in
the
federal
court
on
the
merits
for
the
claim.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
in
the
federal
district
court.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
of
the
claim
of
his
administrate
--
and
his
administrative
--
that
the
administrative
denial
of
his
application
was
without
basis
in
fact
and
denial
due
process.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
now
the
issue
of
exactly
what
kind
of
relief
the
district
court
might
or
might
not
grant.
i
do
not
think
it
is
presently
before
this
court.
it
is
been
recognized
by
many
decisions
including
the
recent
ninth
circuit
decision
in
racher
v.
mcdamera
(ph)
that
even
if,
for
example
the
court
did
not
feel
that
it
could
direct
the
immediate
release
to
the
petitioner,
at
the
very
least
he
has
a
right
to
a
hearing
and
a
determination
on
the
merits
of
his
claim
and
under
the
habeas
corpus
statute
the
court
shall
then
dispose
the
cases
as
law
and
justice
required.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
that
would
be
primarily
a
question
of
military
law
and
for
the
military
court
to
decide.
well,
i
am
not
--
mr.
richard
l.
goff
excuse
me.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
yeah,
i
certainly
think
that
in
a
subsequent
court-martial
proceeding
a
strong
argument
could
be
made
that
such
a
determination
was
res
judicata.
certainly
i
think
the
effect
of
the
district
court,
that
the
district
court
were
to
give
him
the
hearing
on
the
merits
and
were
to
make
the
decision
that
his
application
have
been
denied
without
any
basis
in
fact
and
thus
in
violation
of
his
rights
of
due
process.
that
would
be
determination
that
he
has
a
right
to
discharge
as
a
conscientious
objector
and
i
think
that
a
strong
argument
could
be
made
either
for
the
proposition
that
he
has
a
right
to
discharge
which
deprives
the
military
of
jurisdiction.
indeed
the
solicitor
general’s
own
brief
seems
to
concede
as
much
by
the
reference
in
the
analogy
to
army
regulation
635-200,
or
at
least
for
the
more
limited
proposition
which
several
of
the
district
courts
have
been
adopting
in
their
discharge
orders.
but
at
least
he
ought
to
be
put
in
the
same
position
as
he
would
have
been
in
if
the
military
had
granted
his
application
for
discharge
rather
than
denied
it.
and
this
again
i
think
it
is
something
which
is
recognized
by
the
government’s
own
brief,
in
their
footnote
34
where
they
point
out
the
distinction
between
the
type
of
order
that
the
military
might
give
a
man
even
while
they
are
processing
him
out
such
as
in
order
to
put
on
a
uniform.
and
in
those
circumstances
the
government,
the
man
would
not
be
excuse
from
disobeying
the
order
and
presumably
would
have
to
go
through
the
court-martial
process
anyway.
on
the
other
hand
the
order
which
assigns
him
to
some
new
duty
station
is
an
order
which
clearly
the
military
would
not
have
given
him
if
the
secretary
of
the
army
had
granted
his
application
for
discharge
as
a
conscientious
objector
and
if
the
military
would
not
and
could
not
have
given
him
that
order
then
i
think
it
would
be
quite
proper
for
the
district
court
to
say
that
the
right
of
discharge
shall
be
recognized
now
and
shall
supersede
any
court-martial,
pending
court-martial
proceedings.
certainly
that
is
not
so
surprising
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
military
itself
seems
to
recognize
that
such
an
order
would
be
unlawful.
if
it
was
an
order
which
ordered
the
man
to
a
new
duty
station
and
followed
or
was
depended
upon
a
wrongful
denial
of
a
conscientious
objector
application.
i
think
that
once
the
district
court
has
made
the
basic
determination
that
the
military
denial
of
his
claim
was
wrongful
without
basis
in
fact
and
he
is
entitled
for
discharge
as
a
conscientious
objector,
it
then
certainly
has
the
power
to
inquire
into
the
legality
of
the
man’s
continued
detention.
sort
of
like
the
basic
purpose
the
writ
requiring
the
jailer
to
justify
the
legality
of
the
detention.
and
in
no
circumstances
if
the
government
wish
to
claim
that
the
continued
detention
was
justified
by
subsequent
events
then
i
think
the
court
could
certainly
inquire
in
the
validity
of
that
particular
claim.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
trying
to
pick
up
where
we
left
off
yesterday.
the
government
has
pointed
out
in
its
brief
that
the
various
branches
of
the
armed
services
have
promulgated
regulations,
which
provide
for
an
elaborate
administrative
review
machinery
of
conscientious
objector
application.
now,
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
in
cases
like
a
petitioner
has
already
completed
an
exhausted
that
elaborate
administrative
review
of
machinery.
it
is
important
to
focus
on
the
fact
that
his
habeas
corpus
petition
challenges
and
seeks
review
of
the
validity
of
that
administrative
determination.
it
is
not
a
situation
like
was
present
in
the
gusik
case
or
the
case
of
noyd
v.
bond,
which
the
petitioner
in
habeas
corpus.
and,
the
petitioner
was
brought
to
challenge
and
seek
review
of
alleged
invalidity
or
asserted
errors
in
the
military
criminal
proceedings
which
were
pending
against
the
petitioner.
here,
on
the
other
hand,
the
petitioner
asserts
in
court
a
right
to
discharge
of
the
conscientious
objector,
which
right
is
independent
of
those
criminal
proceeding.
it
is
not
depended
on
any
invalidity
of
those
proceedings.
but,
rather
it
arises
from
the
wrongful
administrative
denial
of
his
application
for
discharges
of
conscientious
objector
without
basis
and
fact.
so
the
government’s
reliance
on
the
exhaustion
of
court-martial
that
was
required
in
noyd
v.
bond
and
in
gusik
v.
shilder.
we
believe
it
is
completely
inapplicable
and
i
think
the
government
itself
recognized
this
only
two
years
ago.
in
a
memorandum,
which
the
solicitor
general
submitted
to
this
court
in
the
case
of
craycroft
v.
ferrall,
a
memorandum
which
we
were
not
able
to
discover
until
yesterday
that
in
clerk's
office.
but,
in
that
particular
case
the
department
--
the
solicitor
general
stated
very
specifically
department
of
justice
had
determined
to
withdraw
its
support
of
the
position
previously
urged
in
the
brief
in
our
position
in
noyd
v.
mcnamara
that
military
judicial
remedies
must
be
exhausted
before
resort
by
a
serviceman
with
conscientious
objector
claims
to
civilian
courts.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
i
think
the
government’s
brief,
as
i
recall
refers
to
the
craycroft
situation
as
one
in
which
the
government
at
that
time
withdrew
its
insistence
that
--
or
any
reliance
on
the
proposition
that
a
conscientious
objector
applicant
must
resort
to
the
military
correction
boards
before
seeking
review
in
a
federal
courts.
i
would
like
to
continue
quoting,
if
i
may
from
--
mr.
richard
l.
goff
well,
i
do
not
think
it
is
in
the
appendix
or
in
the
appendix
to
the
government’s
brief
your
honor.
what
it
is
in
the
memorandum
of
the
solicitor
general
in
craycroft
v.
ferrall
number
718
miscellaneous
october
23,
1969
and
in
that
memorandum
the
solicitor
general
stated
that
nothing
in
this
policy
undermines
the
general
rule
urged
by
the
government
and
adopted
by
this
court
in
noyd
v.
bond
that
military
prisoners
must
ordinarily
exhaust
all
available
remedies
within
the
particular
service
before
seeking
review
on
a
habeas
corpus
petition
in
a
federal
civilian
court.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
the
application
in
this
particular
case,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
parisi
case?
mr.
richard
l.
goff
well,
in
the
parisi
case--
mr.
richard
l.
goff
the
administrative
process
has
been
completely
exhausted.
parisi
had
even
exhausted
the
requirement
for
the
ninth
circuit
was
then
imposing
of
also
applying
to
the
army
board
for
correction
of
military
records.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
beyond
that
he
can
go
nowhere
within
the
administrative
process
and
under
accepted
doctrine
of
the
federal
courts
he
has
the
right
to
come
in
to
the
court
on
habeas
corpus
to
review
the
validity
of
that
administrative
denial.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
on
a
conviction,
the
case
is
presently
under
submission
for
the
court
of
military
review.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
the
conviction
referring,
he
would
have
an
appeal
--
i
understand
that
there
is
not
as
a
right,
but
at
least
to
right
to
seek
in
appeal
from
the
court
of
the
military
appeals.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
that
is
my
understanding
your
honor,
yes.
the
department
of
justice
did
say,
and
this
is
the
key
point
into
this
last
memorandum.
it
is
simply
our
view
shared
by
the
department
of
defense
that
resort
to
court’s
marshall
should
not
be
required
before
we
do
judicial
review
of
a
conscientious
objector
claim
can
be
obtained.
now,
i
recognized
the
right
of
the
government
to
change
its
mind.
but,
i
really
think
they
were
right
the
first
time,
because
i
would
submit
that
the
exhaustion
requirement,
which
they
would
now
seek
to
impose,
that
is
the
demand
exhaust
military
criminal
proceedings
against
him.
in
the
first
place
serves
none
of
the
purposes,
which
underlie
the
exhaustion
requirement,
as
it
has
been
previously
been
developed
by
this
court.
the
government
has
conceded
that
requiring
resort
to
court-martial
remedy
would
not
serve
any
purpose
of
allowing
an
administrative
agency
or
the
military
tribunal
to
develop
a
fact
record,
to
exercise
administrative
discretion,
to
apply
any
expertise
to
factual
questions
or
even
to
special
questions
of
military
law.
such
was
--
as
was
also
emphasized
by
this
court
in
noyd
v.
bond.
furthermore,
the
requiring
resort
to
court-martial
on
this
here,
it
is
not
necessary
to
avoid
a
judicial
intrusion
into
--
or
judicial
intrusion
upon
or
preemption
of
an
agency
to
which
either
congress
or
the
military
has
confided
the
primary
responsibility
for
deciding
or
reviewing
the
basic
question,
which
is
now
being
presented
to
the
federal
court.
the
agency
was
responsible
to
decide
that
question.
that
is
the
secretary
of
the
army
has
already
decided
it
and
we
now
seek
in
federal
court,
the
review
of
that
particular
determination,
so
there
is
no
effort
here
to
disrupt
the
administrative
decision
making
scheme,
which
has
been
set
up
by
the
statute.
in
fact,
if
the
government
were
serious
about
the
claim
that
exhaustion
is
necessary
to
avoid
conflict
with
the
military
or
to
allow
the
military
to
correct
its
own
errors.
then,
i
would
have
thought
that
the
government
would
have
continued
to
insist
that
a
serviceman
appealed
to
the
army
board
for
correction
of
the
military
records
after
the
secretary
of
the
army
has
denied
his
claim
for
conscientious
objection.
but,
as
we
know
in
craycroft
the
government
expressly
conceded
that
such
appeal
was
not
necessary
and
followed
the
brooks
versus
clifford
decision,
which
held
that
you
require
a
petitioner
to
undergo
the
delay
some
four
months
going
to
that
kind
of
a
board
would
work
really
intolerable
interference
with
his
right
to
come
into
court
and
have
access
to
the
court
on
habeas
corpus
for
swift
review
of
the
validity
of
the
administrative
denial
of
its
conscientious
objection
claims.
finally,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
exhaustion
requirements
was
the
government
lives
assert
here
would
operate
in
a
very
random
hit
or
miss
and
rather
discriminatory
manner.
for
example,
obviously
resort
to
court-martial
on
this
would
not
be
required
in
those
cases
and
we
sited
some
in
our
brief
as
examples,
where
after
the
administrative
denial
of
the
conscientious
objector
application
is
taken
place,
the
military
itself
chooses
not
to
insist
on
ordering
a
man
to
a
new
duty
assignment
or
revokes
pending
orders.
so,
that
the
man
can
come
into
court
and
present
his
habeas
corpus
petition.
nor
would
be
applicable
where
in
cases,
and
we
have
also
cited
examples,
where
although
a
military
defense
had
been
committed
and
the
military
and
its
discretion
decides
not
to
press
the
charges.
furthermore,
the
government
has
conceded
that
it
would
be
applicable
under
its
standard
only
in
those
cases
where
the
court-martial
might
be
willing
to
entertain
the
defense.
and
this
results
in
some
rather
perverse
distinction
because
apparently
means
that
the
right
of
quick
federal
review
on
habeas
corpus
would
be
available
to
the
man
who
jumps
the
gun
and
commits
the
military
offense,
before
his
application
for
field
discharge
has
been
finally
processed
and
denied,
but
would
not
be
available
to
the
man
who
waits
until
after
it
is
denied
and
then
commits
this
offense.
similarly,
if
apparently
would
be
available
to
the
man
who
disobeys
a
simple
order,
such
as
to
put
on
your
uniform
or
to
cut
the
weeds
behind
the
post
building.
but,
apparently
would
not
be
available
and
the
writ
would
be
suspended
as
to
someone
who
disobeys
a
more
serious
order,
such
as
to
go
to
vietnam.
and
what
it
all
boils
down
to,
i
think
is
that
the
army’s
denial
of
the
application
could
be
completely
without
basis
in
fact.
totally
wrongful
and
the
man
would
have
a
clear
right
to
come
into
federal
court
on
habeas
corpus
to
get
released
and
yet
a
military
commander,
by
subsequently
giving
that
man
an
order
of
a
particular
kind.
apparently,
a
rather
major
kind
and
then
going
ahead
and
prosecuting
a
man
for
the
disobedience
of
that
order,
could
effectively
bring
about
a
suspension
of
the
right
to
go
to
federal
court.
but,
now,
of
the
course,
the
man
could
obey
the
order
and
then
apparently
he
would
not
--
his
right
would
not
be
suspended.
i
think
that
only
demonstrates
another
perverse
aspect
of
the
exhaustion
requirement
which
the
government
seeks
to
require.
namely
that
operates
most
harshly
on
those
whose
conscientious
objector
convictions
are
most
sincere,
because
in
this
case
for
example
if
parisi
has
been
willing
to
compromise,
what
he
felt
were
his
conscientious
objector
beliefs
and
obeyed
this
particular
order,
then
under
the
government’s
position
and
under
the
court
of
appeals
position
he
would
been
able
to
come
into
court
and
according
to
both
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
government
it
seems
quite
likely
in
this
record
that
he
would
have
received
a
relief
on
the
merit
that
he
was
seeking.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
that
is
correct
and
it
is
consistent
with
those
tentative
conclusions.
but,
i
think
that
if
we
were
to
say,
first
of
all
what
we
were
trying
to
do
at
that
particular
time
was
to
get
either
the
district
judge
or
the
circuit
justices
or
justice
douglas
to
exercise
discretionary
power
to
grant
temporary
injunctive
relief,
which
obviously
depends
on
several
factors
such
as
the
likelihood
of
success
on
the
merits,
of
balancing
the
conveniences
in
determination,
whether
there
is
other
adequate
relief
and
to
say,
that
our
failure
to
get
that
relief
before
there
had
been
any
kind
of
determination
on
the
merits
of
his
conscientious
objector
claim,
should
later
operate
in
effect
to
bar
him
from
getting
into
court
to
review
the
merits
of
that
claim.
i
think
would
be
totally
anomalous,
i
think
justice
douglas
in
his
own
decision
said,
if
it
were
clear
that
applicant
would
win
on
the
merits
or
further
protective
order
at
this
time
would
be
appropriate.
well,
it
was
not
clear
at
that
time.
but,
i
submit
that
the
failure
to
get
temporary
relief
should
not
operate.
first,
to
bar
the
man
from
eventually
coming
into
court
and
having
his
claim
as
conscientious
objector
determined
on
the
merits.
furthermore--
mr.
richard
l.
goff
you
honor,
i
realized
that
those
with
the
tentative
conclusions
of
the
justices
who
passed
on
the
application,
i
would
submit
that
no
one
other
than
mr.
parisi
himself
could
finally
make
the
determination
as
to
whether
that
order
did
in
fact
violate
his
conscientious
objector
beliefs.
he
has
stated
in
an
application
--
mr.
richard
l.
goff
well,
apparently
in
that
case
the
government
would
concede
that
since
the
defense
of
conscientious
objection
or
wrongful
denial
of
conscientious
objector
application
would
not
be
entertained
by
the
court-martial,
that
the
man
would
have
a
perfect
right
to
come
into
federal
court
and
have
the
administrative
denial
of
his
application
reviewed.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
alright,
all
i
am
suggesting
your
honor
is
that
the
basic
thing
that
(voice
overlap)
mr.
richard
l.
goff
i
would
give
you
an
answer
for
that
question.
the
basic
thing
that
we
think
that
a
man
has
the
right
to
under
any
circumstances,
regardless
of
the
pending
military
criminal
proceedings
against
him
is
a
right
to
immediate
review
in
the
federal
court
of
the
wrongfulness
or
the
validity
of
the
administrative
denial
of
his
conscientious
objector
application.
now,
if
the
court
does
make
the
incrimination,
if
the
application
would
deny
that
basis
in
fact,
then
we
would
say
that
the
question
of
what
kind
of
relief
the
district
court
is
to
grant
after
having
made
that
determination
and
if
the
court
for
example
would
have
found
that
it
is
quite
clear
that
an
order
to
a
new
duty
assignment
would
not
had
been
given
to
the
man,
had
the
military
originally
granted
his
application,
as
it
should
have
done,
then
i
think
it
would
be
quite
arguable
to
district
court
that
the
right
of
discharge
ought
to
be
recognized
and
should
cut
across
in
the
military
criminal
prosecution.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
district
court
found
that
the
man
disobeyed
an
order
which
the
court--or
which
the
army
could
have
given
to
him,
even
while
they
were
processing
him
out,
is
the
distinction
that
suggested
by
the
government
by
itself
also,
i
might
add--then
the
court
might
well
say,
the
right
to
discharge
shall
be
recognized.
but,
it
shall
be
subject
to
the
military
prosecution
against
him.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
i
think
that
is
a
perfectly
sensible
resolution
of
this
particular
problem.
i
think
our
brief
discusses
also,
the
fact
that
in
addition
to
the
government's
failure
to
show
any
compelling
government
interest,
supporting
the
suspension
of
the
right
to
habeas
corpus
in
this
case,
they
have
also
completely
failed
to
show
either
an
available
or
adequate
remedy
to
seek
the
kind
of
relief
the
petitioner
does
seek
in
the
district
court
and
for
the
reason
stated
in
brief
and
today
in
oral
arguments,
we
respectfully
request
that
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
be
reversed
and
the
case
be
remanded.
so,
the
petitioner
finally
can
have
his
day
in
court
on
the
merits
of
his
claim.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
yes,
i
would
your
honor.
i
would
make
the
same
argument
that
the
right
to
come
into
court,
to
have
the
court
review
the
wrongfulness
of
the
denial
of
the
discharge
application
should
be
recognized
right
now.
and,
that
the
question
of
what
to
do
about
that
prosecution
for
stealing
the
car
is
the
question
which
pertains
to
the
relief
of
the
district
court
is
going
to
grant.
i
think
that
the
ninth
circuit
is
quite
clearly
recognized
that
in
its
recent
bacher
v.
makimer
(ph)
of
the
mcnamara
case,
cited
in
our
reply
brief
which
said
that
even
if
the
right
to
discharge
would
not
be
immediate
that
the
court
should
immediately
review
the
underlying
claim
of
the
wrongfulness
of
denial
of
conscientious
objector
application
and
then
under
the
habeas
corpus
statute
should
impose
the
case--
mr.
richard
l.
goff
well,
i
think
at
the
right
starting
court
of
course
is
the
right
to
-
-an
order
directing
the
army
to
discharge
and
has
the
conscientious
objector.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
i
think
again,
this
is
a
kind
of
question
that
the
court
could
get
into
determining
what
relief
to
give
a
man.
i
think
that
as
the
ninth
circuit
had
said
the
court
shall
make
the
basic
determination
on
the
merits
and
shall
then
dispose
off
the
case
on
just
as
required.
i
think
that
we
can
allow
our
district
judges
to
adopt
appropriate
remedies
to
take
into
account
these
varying
circumstances
which
might
come
up.
the
basic
right
to
review
is
what
we
seek
in
this
court.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
thank
your
honor.
counsel
has
said
that
the
only
question
here
is
when
can
petitioner
get
access
to
the
federal
court
on
habeas
corpus
to
review
his
claim.
the
petitioner
on
may
22,
1969
first
submitted
to
the
army
his
application
for
a
discharge
of
the
conscientious
objector.
the
processing
of
that
application
continued
until
november
1969
when
it
was
denied.
it
was
after
that
the
petitioner
tried
to
come
into
federal
court
and
secure
the
swift,
prompt
adjudication
of
the
legality
of
the
contention
which
is
contemplated
by
the
habeas
corpus
statute.
the
delay
is
incident
to
requiring
resort
to
the
court-martial
process
would
be
several
months
before
trial
for
in
this
case.
several
months
until
such
time,
the
court
of
military
review
can
review
the
case.
i
realize
at
that
time,
it
is
perhaps
more
in
this
case
than
it
usually
be.
but,
in
many
cases
cited
by
the
governments,
the
delay
has
been
at
least
a
year
from
the
court-martial
until
review
by
the
court
of
military
review
and
in
our
view
and
of
course,
beyond
that
to
the
court
of
military
appeals
and
only
if
the
court
of
military
appeals
point
if
it
all
can
the
petitioner
ever
get
the
discharge,
which
he
seeks
in
the
federal
court
promptly.
and,
it
is
very
doubtful
in
our
view
that
if
he
ever
did
get
a
discharge.
administrative
discharge
is
result
of
the
court-martial
process.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
in
this
case
those
procedures
were
completed
by
november
1969.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
the
habeas
was
filed
almost
immediately,
but
that
was
suspended,
because
under
the
--
mr.
richard
l.
goff
the
habeas
was
filed
late
in
november
1969.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
that
was
in
december
of
1969.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
after
the
filling
of
the
habeas
corpus
petition.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
that
is
correct
and
it
was
not
until
the
denial
by
the
army
board
for
correction
of
military
records,
that
under
the
ninth
circuit's
view
at
that
time,
he
was
able
to
comeback
in
the
federal
court
to
seek
review
on
the
merits
and
it
was
that
time
he
was
meant
by
the
government's
stay
in
motion.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
at
that
time
and
until
very
recently
in
their
bacher
versus
makimer
(ph)
opinion,
the
ninth
circuit
required
the
serviceman,
even
after
denial
by
the
secretary
of
the
army
to
go
on
appeal
to
the
army
board
for
correction.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
that
is
correct,
because
ironically
the
military
regulation
(voice
overlap)
mr.
richard
l.
goff
i
think
the
charges
had
been
lodged
and
the
petitioner
was
incarcerated
into
stockade.
the
trial
did
not
occur--incidentally
the
trial
did
not
occur
until
after
district
court’s
order
in
this
case,
so
certainly
at
the
time
of
the
district
court’s
order,
the
petitioner
was
not
at
that
time
advancing
this
defense
in
the
court-martial
proceeding.
i
think
it
would
have
been
extremely
imprudent
for
him
to
fail
to
do
so,
under
to
the
terms
of
district
courts
order.
but
again,
the
whole
possibility--
mr.
richard
l.
goff
the
charges
had
been
preferred.
the
trial
took
place
shortly
after
district
court's
order
staying
these
particular
proceeding.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
court-martial
conviction,
as
i
recall
would
be
april
of
1970.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
there
has
been
some
delay,
your
honor
is
the
result
of
extension
in
the
time
sought
by
petitioner's
counsel.
we
do
not
represent,
but
he
does
have
other
counsel,
who
had
sought
extensions.
but,
even
absence
of
those
extensions,
it
seems
to
us
just
looking
at
many
cases,
the
government
had
decided,
an

to
12
month
delay
is
not
unusual
at
all.
and,
we
think
that
that
kind
of
delay
is
completely
inconsistent
with
the
purpose
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
i
understand
that
the
extensions
were
sought
on
the
ground
that
he
simply
had
not
any
time
yet
to
complete
the
brief
and
to
present
it
to
the
court.
mr.
richard
l.
goff
no
is
not.
the
case
is
under
submission,
petitioner’s
counsel
did
waive
oral
argument,
so
the
case
is
under
submission
i
think
for
two
months
and
the
letter
in
the
appendix
estimates
that
september
at
least
--
i
am
sorry
as
of
an
earlier
time,
two
to
four
months
delay
could
be
expected.
