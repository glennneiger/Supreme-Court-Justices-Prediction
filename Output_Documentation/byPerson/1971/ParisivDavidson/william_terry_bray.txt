mr.
william
terry
bray
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset
let
me
emphasize
that
the
government’s
position
does
not
attempt
to
support
the
denial
of
petitioner’s
right
for
review
in
the
civilian
courts
at
some
point
in
time,
the
question
rather
is
when
should
that
review
occur.
specifically,
the
question
is
whether
the
district
court
erred
in
the
exercise
of
its
discretion
by
deferring
action
on
the
petitioner’s
habeas
corpus
claim
pending
the
completion
of
military
judicial
proceedings,
where
those
proceedings
had
before
them
the
very
issue
which
had
been
presented
in
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding
and
where
it
was
reasonably
to
be
expected
that
the
military
not
only
would
pass
on
that,
but
that
if
it
accepted
the
petitioner’s
position,
the
petitioner
would
receive
all
of
the
relief,
which
he
sought
in
the
district
court.
this,
we
think
brings
into
play
the
traditional
doctrine
of
exhaustion
of
military
remedies
which
this
court
explained
both
in
gusik
and
later
in
noyd
versus
bond
and
that
the
decision
below
is
quite
appropriate
and
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
william
terry
bray
that
is
correct.
however,
at
the
time
the
administrative
remedies
were
exhausted
and
when
the
habeas
corpus
action
came
before
the
district
court
for
its
action
on
the
merits.
the
petitioner
had
committed
a
court-martial
offense
and
that
offense
was
inextricably
caught
up
with
his
claim
to
be
a
conscientious
objector
and
indeed
the
military
has
always
taken
the
position
in
this
case
that
that
order
would
be
an
unlawful
order
and
thus,
he
would
not
be
subject
to
court-martial.
if
he
were
improperly
denied
his
conscientious
objector
application
would
be
a
(voice
overlap)
process.
mr.
william
terry
bray
there
would
be
no
need
then
to
stay
the
habeas
corpus
action,
with
respect
to
essentially
collateral
review
of
the
administrative
determination
by
the
military.
because
the
military
system
itself
would
not
be
engaged
in
collateral
review
of
that
same
decision.
that
really
is
what
we
are
saying
is
happening
here.
the
military
judiciary--
mr.
william
terry
bray
the
result
if
he
were
convicted
of
murder
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
the
position
of
the
military
is
that
if
the
civilian
courts
ordered
his
discharge
from
the
army,
he
would
be
discharged
immediately.
even
if
he
were
under
senate's
confined
convention.
mr.
william
terry
bray
it
could
be
heard
immediately
without
any
waiting
at
all
for
the
proceedings
in
the
military
system.
mr.
william
terry
bray
as
a
tentative
matter
however,
our
position
is
that
the
determination
is
not
final
at
that
point
and
further
that
the
lawfulness
of
the
order
is
not
premised
strictly
on
whether
or
not
the
order
conflicts
with
his
conscientious
objector
status,
but,
rather
whether
the
order
was
given
as
a
direct
result
of
the
denial
of
that
conscientious
objector
status.
mr.
william
terry
bray
that
is
not
quite
right,
because
even
if
he
were
granted
his
application
as
administrative
matter,
there
would
still
be
a
period
of
time
during
which
he
would
be
processed
for
a
discharge,
and
during
that
period
of
time
he
is
subject
to
the
type
of
order
which
we
say
would
not
be
the
type
that
would
delay
civil
proceedings.
he
would
have
to
wear
a
uniform
during
that
period
of
time.
he
would
have
to
clean
up
his
quarters
during
that
period
of
time.
he
would
have
to
cit
the
grass
if
told
to
do
so
during
that
period
of
time.
that
is
the
distinction
we
think
between
the
two.
the
court
of
military
appeals,
highest
military
court
has
held
that
the
type
of
order
which
is
subject
to
challenge
on
the
ground
that
the
administrative
proceeding
was
without
basis
and
fact,
is
one
that
grows
directly
out
of
and
is
based
on
the
administrative
decision.
no
change
in
duty
station,
that
if
the
type
of
order
that
he
is
involved
here,
would
ever
be
given
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
whether
or
not
the
order
was
within
the
confines
of
his
conscientious
scruples
is
not
the
test.
the
test
rather
is
whether
the
order
grew
out
of
the
denial
of
the
application
and
even
though
it
maybe
completely
consistent
as
the
judiciary
--
the
civilian
judiciary
has
tentatively
decided
with
his
claim
to
be
a
conscientious
objector.
nevertheless,
it
is
subjected
to
being
defended
on
the
basis
that
it
would
not
have
been
given,
but
for
this
administrative
decision
and
that
administrative
decision
is
without
basis
and
fact.
mr.
william
terry
bray
if
he
put
in
no
defense
in
this
case,
our
position
generally
i
think
would
be
that
there
should
be
an
opportunity
for
him
to
do
so,
once
it
is
beyond
the
point
where
it
could
be
brought
into
the
military
proceedings
then,
there
would
be
no
exhaustion
required
beyond
that
point.
that
would
mean
at
the
very
least
that
a
decision
would
have
to
be
rendered
by
the
court-martial,
given
an
order
that
could
be
challenged
on
this
ground
for
such
as
the
order
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
until
the
point
in
time
when
he
was
unable
to
put
in
that
defense,
yes.
mr.
william
terry
bray
what
grows
is
out
of
the
seal
business
is--
mr.
william
terry
bray
what
grows
out
of
it
if
his
refusal
to
obey
the
order.
now,
he
chooses
not
the
defend
his
disobedience
of
the
order
on
that
ground,
then
after
the
court-martial
has
handed
down
its
judgment
against
him.
then,
the
civilian
courts
could
go
forward
with
it
and
indeed
i
might
point
out
that
that
is
essentially--
mr.
william
terry
bray
that
conviction,
yes
they
could
if
they
found
that
the
order
there
was
one
that
grew
out
of
(voice
overlap)
mr.
william
terry
bray
no,
i
am
not
suggesting
that.
mr.
william
terry
bray
it
could,
now
that
would
bring
up
i
think
the
different
question
whether
because
he
had
willfully
failed
to
raise
a
possible
remedy
within
the
military
system,
he
should
be
barred
from
bringing
it
into
the
civilian
courts.
that
is
not
our
case
and
that
is
not
my
position
at
this
point
in
time.
frankly,
i
do
not
know
what
position
would
be
of
the
government
if
that
situation
should
be
presented.
our
position
is
that
he
has
defended
in
this
case
and
indeed
the
issue
not
only
was
argued
to
his
court-martial.
but
was--or
is
before
the
court
of
military
review
and
he
is
defending
the
lawfulness
of
his
order
on
the
ground
that
it
was
directly
a
result
of
the
administrative
denial
and
the
collateral
attack
on
that
administrative
denial
on
the
basis
in
fact
test
is
before
the
military
tribunals.
that
we
think
is
the
traditional
circumstance
in
which
this
court
has
approved
the
lower
courts
in
their
awaiting
the
outcome
of
the
military
decision
before
going
forward
on
the
precise
issue
that
is
involved
before
the
military?
this
of
course
essentially
is
grounded
on
considerations
of
comity.
the
court
has
frequently
stated
that
civilian
court
should
not
intervene,
if
there
is
an
available
remedy
within
the
military
court
system
and
if
that
remedy
might
provide
the
relief
which
the
petitioners
is
seeking
in
the
civilian
courts.
the
reason
of
course
is
that
the
petitioner
may
well
be
successful
in
the
military
courts
and
in
that
event
it
would
be
absolutely
no
need
for
the
civilian
courts
to
get
involved
at
all,
thus
avoiding
any
needless
friction
between
the
two
separate
judicial
systems.
further,
this
is
not,
at
this
point
in
time,
a
situation
where
the
civilian
court
has
said
they
cannot
act
on
this
matter.
it
rather,
truly
is
more
on
only
of
timing.
in
this
case,
the
issue
is
involved
in
the
military
proceedings,
the
court-martial
proceedings,
which
are
in
the
military
judicial
courts
and
decision
there
on
precisely
the
same
standard
as
is
supplied
in
the
civilian
courts
can
be
expected.
and,
the
decision
below
only
is
to
await
that
decision
before
it
goes
forward.
mr.
william
terry
bray
our
position
there
i
believe
mr.
justice
white,
would
be
that
he
can
go
ahead
and
get
heard
and
decide
in
the--
mr.
william
terry
bray
that
is
right,
that
is
it
all
it
is
at
this
point
in
time.
that
is
all
it
is
ever
been.
mr.
william
terry
bray
principally,
that
is
what
involved.
we
believe
there
are
some
additional
factors
involved
but
that
is
the
basic
one,
which
was
before
this
court
in
gusik
and
noyd
versus
bond.
mr.
william
terry
bray
the
policy
of
the
military,
as
stated
that
we
think,
properly
stated
in
the
regulation
in
our
appendix.
when
a
civilian
court
determines
that
a
serviceman
was
improperly
denied
discharge
without
a
basis
and
fact,
the
military
system
will
discharge
him
on
that
ground,
regardless
of
the
outcome
of
the
military
litigation.
mr.
william
terry
bray
no,
i
am
saying
that
even
if
there
were
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
a
final
determination
from
the
court
of
military
appeals
and
then
the
civilian
courts
held
that
he
was
entitled
to
discharge
--
the
military
would
discharge.
indeed,
the
goguen
decision
that
also
is
reproduced
in
our
appendix,
involved
a
very
similar
circumstance
where
the
claim
had
been
denied
through
the
court
of
military
review
and
was
pending
in
the
court
of
military
appeals
when
the
civilian
court
acted
and
the
court
of
military
appeals
dismissed
the
suit
on
the
ground
that
the
issue
had
been
decided
by
the
civilian
courts
and
a
fellowship
therefore
be
discharged.
mr.
william
terry
bray
the
same
result
would
follow,
the
servicemen
would
be
discharged
on
the
basis
of
the
civilian
court's
order.
mr.
william
terry
bray
that
has
not
been
--
either
their
policy
as
stated
by
the
regulation
or
their
policy
in
practice.
they
have
processed
the
discharge
properly
in
those
circumstances.
mr.
william
terry
bray
they
have
not
done
that
and
as
a
matter
of
their
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
could
they
do
that?
mr.
william
terry
bray
there
suppose
could
be
an
argument
made
that
once
that
the
two
systems
are
completely
autonomous
and
once
a
decision
has
been
made
in
the
military
system,
it
cannot
be
reviewed
in
the
civilian
courts,
at
all.
we
do
not
make
that
argument
in
this
case.
mr.
william
terry
bray
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
terry
bray
absolutely
not
mr.
justice
brennan
that
is
a--
mr.
william
terry
bray
we
certainly
have
not
and
we
would
not--
mr.
william
terry
bray
i
do
not
mean
to
suggest
that
it
is
about
my
client.
the
position
of
the
government
is
that
even
though
a
decision
had
been
handed
down
by
the
court
of
the
military
appeals,
the
highest
court
that
would
not
be
binding
in
the
subsequent
habeas
corpus
action
in
the
district
court,
the
civilian
district
court.
and,
that
the
court
then
could
order,
could
find
that
there
was
no
basis
in
fact,
in
order
of
discharge
and
if
the
army
would
properly
discharge
the
fellow
on
that
basis.
mr.
william
terry
bray
i
do
not
think
that
is
right
for
--
let
me
explain
to
you,
this
case
i
think
indicates
what
the
remedy
should
and
would
be
in
that
circumstance.
the
military
man
is
not
going
to
be
subjected
to
orders
that
--
or
should
not
be
subjected
to
orders,
which
are
inconsistent
with
his
claimed
status.
here,
the
district
court
tried
to
protect
him
on
that
basis
and
entered
a
protective
order
barring
the
army
from
ordering
him
to
do
things
of
a
greater
degree
than
what
he
was
doing.
psychological
counseling.
he
was
going
to
vietnam
to
be
a
psychological
counselor
and
the
civilian
judiciary
by
the
ninth
circuit
and
by
the
circuit
justice
determined
that
was
no
greater
burden
on
him
than
what
he
had
been
doing
in
california.
and
thus,
refused
to
stay
the
order.
if
on
the
other
hand,
he
was
given
an
order
to
use
an
example
to
go
take
a
rifle
training
or
something
of
that
sort
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
that
is
right.
now,
it
is
not
a
denial--
mr.
william
terry
bray
mr.
justice
marshall
let
me
suggest
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
that
is
not
what
i
mean.
mr.
william
terry
bray
for
two
reasons,
first
of
all,
the
army
--
there
are
means
of
challenging
the
army’s
order
before
he
is
subjected
to
court-martial
just
as
the
petitioner
here
attempted
to
do
and
then
unilaterally,
on
his
own,
he
decided
that
the
order
could
not
be
obeyed
by
him
and
did
not
obey
it.
after
the
civilian
courts
had
an
opportunity
to
review
it
and
refused
to
stay
it.
secondly,
the
order
involved
here
is
one
that
grew
directly
out
of
the
army’s
denial
of
his
application.
they
would
not
have
transferred
him
to
vietnam
or
anywhere
else
for
that
matter.
if
so
long
as
that
application
was
pending.
thus
the
order
itself
is
inextricably
caught
up
in
the
claim
and
for
that
reason
he
can
defend
it.
and,
for
that
reason
the
military
courts
have
decided
to
accept
a
collateral
challenge
to
a
administrative
determination
within
the
military
and
consider
whether
or
not
that
administrative
action
has
any
basis
in
fact.
that
of
course
is
precisely
the
issue
which
he
is
presenting
to
the
civilian
courts
now
by
means
of
habeas
corpus
and
we
think
the
military
court
should
be
able
to
go
forward.
there
are
--
i
think
some
other
reasons
that
involved
here
besides
the
comity
alone,
which
suggest
letting
the
military
system
run
its
course
before
the
court
below
acts
as
it
has
done.
mr.
william
terry
bray
subject
to
that
court’s
control,
yes
sir
just
as
what
happened
here.
mr.
william
terry
bray
i
believe
he
could.
there
is
nothing
that
would
prevent
the
military
from
transferring
him
wherever
it
is
all
fit,
so
long
as
its
--
either
its
regulations
did
not
prohibit
and
they
would
not
in
that
circumstance
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
william
terry
bray
well,
of
course
here
the
petitioner
sought
to
have
his
transfer
stayed,
because
he
was
concerned
that
the
courts
would
loss
jurisdiction,
which
would
seem
to
me
to
imply
that
he
did
not
have
anything
other
than
a
court
order
to
keep
him
from
being
transferred.
the
court
refused
to
stay
it
on
the
ground
one
that
army
agreed
to
bring
him
back
into
the
judicial
district
if
he
won
on
appeal
and
further
under
the
protective
order
that
the
court
is
previously
in.
mr.
william
terry
bray
the
army’s
position
is
that
no
duty
station
transfer
will
be
ordered
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
to
a
co.
mr.
william
terry
bray
that
is
right.
mr.
william
terry
bray
it
is
a
regulation.
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
terry
bray
the
claim
would
be
the
same
as
has
been
made
at
this
point
in
time
that
is
that
the
administrative
determination
was
without
basis
in
fact
and
that
the
order
which
in
sued
and
for
which
disobedience
of
which
he
was
convicted,
grew
directly
out
of
that.
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes,
the
claim
is
that
without
a
basis
in
fact
he
has
been
denied
due
process
of
law
and
that
has
been
accepted
in
the
courts,
at
this
point
in
time,
but
we
are
not
disputing
it
here.
mr.
william
terry
bray
that
is
correct,
the
court-martial’s
attitude
is
that
if
the
order
grew
out
of
the
administrative
denial
and
that
is
without
basis
in
fact
then
the
order
itself--
mr.
william
terry
bray
i
would
presume
it
would,
yes
sir.
the
regulation
is
binding
on
the
military
statute.
mr.
william
terry
bray
speaking
of
course
for
petitioner
here,
but
my
understanding
of
his
position
is
and
this
has
been
accepted
in
the
courts
generally
that
the
denial
of
administrative
remedy
available
within
the
military
that
does
not
have
basis
in
fact
is
a
denial
of
the
due
process.
that
is
a
constitutional
claim
that
entitles
to
him
to
have
it
set
aside.
but,
we
have
not
as
i
say
i
challenged
that
in
this
court
or
elsewhere
at
this
point
in
time.
the
other
aspects
of
this,
which
indicate
to
us
that
the
district
court
below
was
quite
proper
in
awaiting
the
outcome,
of
course
are
tied
up
in
the
fact
that
this
is
a
court-martial
proceeding
that
the
petitioner
did
on
his
own
decide
to
disobey
an
order
that
he
had
received
prior
approval
at
least
in
the
sense
of
refusing
to
stay
it
by
the
civilian
system.
and,
that
this
goes
to
the
very
heart
of
what
a
military
system
is
all
about
and
the
obedience
and
duty
that
are
necessary
to
that
system.
the
military
should
be
able
to
go
forward
with
its
disciplinary
actions
and
try
to
decide
the
issue
itself.
further,
the
underlying
issue
of
course
is
the
administration
of
the
army’s
regulations.
the
military
law
that
is
involved
in
this
case,
while
the
military
courts
do
not
have
any
peculiar
expertise
with
respect
to
the
basis
in
fact
test.
a
test
that
it
will
be
applied
in
the
collateral
review
of
the
administrative
determination,
they
do,
we
submit,
have
expertise
with
regard
to
the
military
generally
and
the
military's
administration
of
its
regulations
and
thus,
might
well
be
able
to
bring
knowledge
to
bare
on
this
questions,
as
well
as
give
guidelines
that
might
promote
uniformity
within
the
military
itself
or
the
administration
of
this
regulation.
all
of
which
suggests
that
the
military
be
allowed
to
go
forward.
further,
we
are
not
persuaded
by
the
petitioner’s
arguments
that
there
has
been
a
wrongful
denial
here
and
such
that
it
should
be
set
aside.
first,
let
me
emphasize
that
this
is
not
a
question.
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
the
court-martial
proceedings
had
not
been
brought
when
the
habeas
corpus
action
came
before
the
court
for
its
action.
here,
the
petitioner
had
disobeyed
the
order
and
the
court-martial
was
imminent
at
the
time
the
district
court
considered
the
habeas
corpus
petition
on
its
merits.
while
the
court
have
previously
stated
its
consideration
of
it
that
had
been
in
terms
of
letting
the
administrative
proceedings
run
their
course
and
that
was
a
matter,
separate
and
apart
from
the
court-martial
itself.
now,
this
of
course
distinguishes
this
case
from
the
second
circuit's
case
of
hammond
versus
lenfest.
and,
our
policy
is
in
agreement
with
the
hammond
position.
that
is
that
where
they
are
no
court-martial
proceedings
pending,
there
is
no
exhaustion
required
within
the
military
tribunals.
that
is
shown
in
our
appendix,
i
believe
it
is
at
page
61
and
that
is
our
policy
position
on
this
that
we
will
not
require
that,
but
we
consider
the
two
cases
significantly
different.
secondly,
the
delay
involved
in
this
case
of
course
is
inherent
in
the
exhaustion
doctrine
itself.
the
whole
purpose
of
it
as
a
part
of
this
case
is
merely
to
postpone,
the
action
by
the
civilian
courts,
until
such
time
as
the
military
has
a
chance
to
clean
its
own
house
if
that
is
required.
if
a
mistake
has
been
made
and
to
pass
on
the
same
issue
that
is
before
the
civilian
courts.
the
underlying
issue
of
the
validity
of
the
administrative
determination,
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
is
a
conscientious
objector
of
course
is
very
much
alive.
it
is
not
conceded
by
us
at
this
point
in
time
and
it
is
not
conceded
on
this
record
that
he
is
entitled
to
his
conscientious
objector
claim.
that
is
still
a
matter
before
competent
tribunals,
all
be
it
military
ones
at
this
point
in
time
in
our
judgment.
just
as
it
was
at
the
time
the
stay
was
denied
by
mr.
justice
douglas
in
december
of
1969.
finally,
the
delay
which
a
petitioner
has
gone
through
here
is
something
which
we
do
not
find
particularly
burdensome
on
him,
because,
the
order
of
district
court
of
course,
has
been
enforced
throughout
this
period,
he
could
not
have
been
subjected
to
government
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
military
duties
any
greater
than
his
psychological
counseling
duties
at
the
time
this
all
started.
further--
mr.
william
terry
bray
where
is
he
now?
he
is
at
home
now,
to
my
knowledge.
at
least
he
is
not
on
any
military
reservation
precinct
to
orders.
he
has
finished
serving
his
confinement
which
was
remitted
partially
and
his
own
excess
leave
status,
which
means
that
he
is
outside
of
the
military
in
present
time,
although
subject
to
its
jurisdiction,
until
such
time
as
the
decision
from
the
military
tribunals
is
final.
mr.
william
terry
bray
is
he
getting
paid?
i
do
not
believe
if
he
is
getting
paid.
this
excess
leave
status
does
not
count,
is
not
charged
against
him
as
leave
time.
it
is
not
credited
against
his
service
in
the
military
and
i
would
understand
from
that
he
is
not
paid
during
the
time
either.
there
would
have
been
means,
whereby
he
could
have
gotten
out
of
confinement
during
his
time,
had
he
sought
to
do
so.
the
records,
we
have
been
able
to
check,
indicate
that
he
did
not
seek
to
do
so.
although,
the
standard
on
which
he
would
have
done
so,
is
essentially
a
discretionary
one
up
to
his
commanding
officer
both
wherever
he
is
held
in
confinement.
as
well
as,
the
convening
authority
so
long
as
it
has
jurisdiction
over
it.
yet
he
could
have
applied
for
that
and
did
not.
in
any
event,
as
i
say
the
confinement
is
not
what
he
was
complaining
of,
it
was
rather
activities
inconsistent
with
the
co
claim.
lastly,
if
i
can
mention
briefly,
we
do
think
of
course
that
there
are
remedies
within
the
military
system
for
petitioner,
both
with
respect
to
the
consideration
of
the
issue,
which
he
has
brought
before
the
court.
we
think
it
is
beyond
doubt
that
issue
will
be
considered
in
the
military
tribunals
as
it
has
so
far
been
considered.
it
was
considered
on
the
merits
by
the
court-martial
itself,
while
that
authority
found
that
it
was
--
that
the
administrative
denial
was
not
an
abuse
of
discretion.
we
think
it
has
--
for
all
practical
purposes,
which
essentially
the
same
is
the
basis
in
fact
and
it
is
very
clear
that
the
court
before
which
the
appeal
is
now
pending,
the
court
of
military
review
will
consider
on
that
test.
mr.
william
terry
bray
on
the
basis
and
fact
test.
the
goguen
decision,
which
is
in
our
appendix,
very
clearly
states
that--
mr.
william
terry
bray
it
is
covered
in
our
brief
and
also
covered
in
the
goguen
decision
which
is
reproduced
as
appendix
d
at
our
brief
and
the
base,
the
test,
which
the
military
will
apply,
this
has
been
a
developing
area,
the
regulations
themselves
are
very
recent
origin
having
coming
into
being
in
1962.
but,
the
test
has
developed
and
it
is
very
clear
now
that
the
test
that
will
be
applied
is
a
basis
and
fact
test,
exactly
the
same
as
that
applied
in
the
civilian
courts.
that
is
the
holding
of
goguen
that
it
will
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
let
me
refer
you
to
page
39,
as
well
mr.
justice
douglas
and
particularly
that
footnote.
while
the
court-martial
itself
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes,
sir
i
am
sorry.
are
you
referring
to
the
appendix?
i
am
referring
to
our
brief
at
pages
39
and
40.
while
the
court-martial
itself
stated
that
it
would
consider
this
as
not
being
an
arbitrary
unreasonable
abuse
of
discretion,
as
we
say
there,
we
do
not
think
that
really
is
any
different
from
a
basis
and
fact
test
and
in
any
event
that
is
the
matter
which
undoubtedly
will
be
corrected
if
any
error
would
be
committed
there
by
the
court
of
military
review,
which
is
fully
competent
to
correct
this,
since
is
really
a
legal
decision.
mr.
william
terry
bray
no,
no.
the
court
of
military
review
is
a
mandatory
review
and
that
is
where
(voice
overlap)
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes,
well
it
has
chosen
--
it
had
stated
that
it
will
review
conscientious
objector
claims,
also
as
a
mandatory
matter
and
that
is
where
the
case
is
now.
that
the
certiorari
type
jurisdiction
is
in
the
court
of
military
appeals,
the
third
step
in
the
proceedings.
but
the
goguen
decision,
in
our
appendix,
is
a
court
of
military
review.
the
same
court
before
which
he
now
has
his
appeal
pending
and
it
is
clear
from
that
decision
that
the
test
will
be
precisely
the
same
as
that
applied
on
the
civilian
courts.
lastly,
we
think
that
the
he
will,
as
a
practical
matter,
receive
the
relief.
he
is
requested
in
the
district
court.
if
he
wins
in
the
military
courts,
he
will
be
discharged.
we
think
that
not
only
as
a
matter
of
our
regulations,
but
also
as
a
matter
of
the
court's
supervisory
powers
in
any
event
the
district
court
here
has
retained
jurisdiction
only
until
the
court-martial
is
final.
that
would
occur
when
the
decision
--
when
a
filed
decision
is
reached
in
the
military
tribunals
and
at
that
point
in
time
if
he
has
not
gotten
the
relief
he
wishes,
surely
the
district
court
would
grant
it
to
him.
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
terry
bray
as
i
say,
i
am
not
sure
what
kind
of
habeas
it
is
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
--
that
is
the
petitioner’s
case.
my
understanding
of
the
basis
on
which
this
was
brought
in
the
court
is
--
that
he
has
been
denied
due
process
of
law,
because
the
administrative
determination
is
without
basis
and
fact.
mr.
william
terry
bray
it
is
not
a
2225--
mr.
william
terry
bray
counsel
advises
that
the
action
was
brought
under
section
2241.
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes
sir,
they
are
certainly
are.
mr.
william
terry
bray
the
articles
reproduced
in
our
appendix
that
established
these
courts.
articles
66
and
67
as
military
courts
and
these
are
holdings
to
that
fact.
mr.
william
terry
bray
well,
this
is
not
an
attack
on
the
court-martial.
this
is
an
attack
on
the
administrative
determination
and
our
position
is
that
the
collateral
attack
on
the
administrative
determination
is
pending
in
the
military
courts
in
connection
with
a
court-martial
proceeding.
and,
that
comity
as
well
as
other
consideration
suggests
that
the
civilian
courts
not
act
until
that
is
completed.
mr.
william
terry
bray
that
is
correct.
am
i
advised
by
counsel?
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
william
terry
bray
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset
let
me
emphasize
that
the
government’s
position
does
not
attempt
to
support
the
denial
of
petitioner’s
right
for
review
in
the
civilian
courts
at
some
point
in
time,
the
question
rather
is
when
should
that
review
occur.
specifically,
the
question
is
whether
the
district
court
erred
in
the
exercise
of
its
discretion
by
deferring
action
on
the
petitioner’s
habeas
corpus
claim
pending
the
completion
of
military
judicial
proceedings,
where
those
proceedings
had
before
them
the
very
issue
which
had
been
presented
in
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding
and
where
it
was
reasonably
to
be
expected
that
the
military
not
only
would
pass
on
that,
but
that
if
it
accepted
the
petitioner’s
position,
the
petitioner
would
receive
all
of
the
relief,
which
he
sought
in
the
district
court.
this,
we
think
brings
into
play
the
traditional
doctrine
of
exhaustion
of
military
remedies
which
this
court
explained
both
in
gusik
and
later
in
noyd
versus
bond
and
that
the
decision
below
is
quite
appropriate
and
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
william
terry
bray
that
is
correct.
however,
at
the
time
the
administrative
remedies
were
exhausted
and
when
the
habeas
corpus
action
came
before
the
district
court
for
its
action
on
the
merits.
the
petitioner
had
committed
a
court-martial
offense
and
that
offense
was
inextricably
caught
up
with
his
claim
to
be
a
conscientious
objector
and
indeed
the
military
has
always
taken
the
position
in
this
case
that
that
order
would
be
an
unlawful
order
and
thus,
he
would
not
be
subject
to
court-martial.
if
he
were
improperly
denied
his
conscientious
objector
application
would
be
a
(voice
overlap)
process.
mr.
william
terry
bray
there
would
be
no
need
then
to
stay
the
habeas
corpus
action,
with
respect
to
essentially
collateral
review
of
the
administrative
determination
by
the
military.
because
the
military
system
itself
would
not
be
engaged
in
collateral
review
of
that
same
decision.
that
really
is
what
we
are
saying
is
happening
here.
the
military
judiciary--
mr.
william
terry
bray
the
result
if
he
were
convicted
of
murder
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
the
position
of
the
military
is
that
if
the
civilian
courts
ordered
his
discharge
from
the
army,
he
would
be
discharged
immediately.
even
if
he
were
under
senate's
confined
convention.
mr.
william
terry
bray
it
could
be
heard
immediately
without
any
waiting
at
all
for
the
proceedings
in
the
military
system.
mr.
william
terry
bray
as
a
tentative
matter
however,
our
position
is
that
the
determination
is
not
final
at
that
point
and
further
that
the
lawfulness
of
the
order
is
not
premised
strictly
on
whether
or
not
the
order
conflicts
with
his
conscientious
objector
status,
but,
rather
whether
the
order
was
given
as
a
direct
result
of
the
denial
of
that
conscientious
objector
status.
mr.
william
terry
bray
that
is
not
quite
right,
because
even
if
he
were
granted
his
application
as
administrative
matter,
there
would
still
be
a
period
of
time
during
which
he
would
be
processed
for
a
discharge,
and
during
that
period
of
time
he
is
subject
to
the
type
of
order
which
we
say
would
not
be
the
type
that
would
delay
civil
proceedings.
he
would
have
to
wear
a
uniform
during
that
period
of
time.
he
would
have
to
clean
up
his
quarters
during
that
period
of
time.
he
would
have
to
cit
the
grass
if
told
to
do
so
during
that
period
of
time.
that
is
the
distinction
we
think
between
the
two.
the
court
of
military
appeals,
highest
military
court
has
held
that
the
type
of
order
which
is
subject
to
challenge
on
the
ground
that
the
administrative
proceeding
was
without
basis
and
fact,
is
one
that
grows
directly
out
of
and
is
based
on
the
administrative
decision.
no
change
in
duty
station,
that
if
the
type
of
order
that
he
is
involved
here,
would
ever
be
given
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
whether
or
not
the
order
was
within
the
confines
of
his
conscientious
scruples
is
not
the
test.
the
test
rather
is
whether
the
order
grew
out
of
the
denial
of
the
application
and
even
though
it
maybe
completely
consistent
as
the
judiciary
--
the
civilian
judiciary
has
tentatively
decided
with
his
claim
to
be
a
conscientious
objector.
nevertheless,
it
is
subjected
to
being
defended
on
the
basis
that
it
would
not
have
been
given,
but
for
this
administrative
decision
and
that
administrative
decision
is
without
basis
and
fact.
mr.
william
terry
bray
if
he
put
in
no
defense
in
this
case,
our
position
generally
i
think
would
be
that
there
should
be
an
opportunity
for
him
to
do
so,
once
it
is
beyond
the
point
where
it
could
be
brought
into
the
military
proceedings
then,
there
would
be
no
exhaustion
required
beyond
that
point.
that
would
mean
at
the
very
least
that
a
decision
would
have
to
be
rendered
by
the
court-martial,
given
an
order
that
could
be
challenged
on
this
ground
for
such
as
the
order
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
until
the
point
in
time
when
he
was
unable
to
put
in
that
defense,
yes.
mr.
william
terry
bray
what
grows
is
out
of
the
seal
business
is--
mr.
william
terry
bray
what
grows
out
of
it
if
his
refusal
to
obey
the
order.
now,
he
chooses
not
the
defend
his
disobedience
of
the
order
on
that
ground,
then
after
the
court-martial
has
handed
down
its
judgment
against
him.
then,
the
civilian
courts
could
go
forward
with
it
and
indeed
i
might
point
out
that
that
is
essentially--
mr.
william
terry
bray
that
conviction,
yes
they
could
if
they
found
that
the
order
there
was
one
that
grew
out
of
(voice
overlap)
mr.
william
terry
bray
no,
i
am
not
suggesting
that.
mr.
william
terry
bray
it
could,
now
that
would
bring
up
i
think
the
different
question
whether
because
he
had
willfully
failed
to
raise
a
possible
remedy
within
the
military
system,
he
should
be
barred
from
bringing
it
into
the
civilian
courts.
that
is
not
our
case
and
that
is
not
my
position
at
this
point
in
time.
frankly,
i
do
not
know
what
position
would
be
of
the
government
if
that
situation
should
be
presented.
our
position
is
that
he
has
defended
in
this
case
and
indeed
the
issue
not
only
was
argued
to
his
court-martial.
but
was--or
is
before
the
court
of
military
review
and
he
is
defending
the
lawfulness
of
his
order
on
the
ground
that
it
was
directly
a
result
of
the
administrative
denial
and
the
collateral
attack
on
that
administrative
denial
on
the
basis
in
fact
test
is
before
the
military
tribunals.
that
we
think
is
the
traditional
circumstance
in
which
this
court
has
approved
the
lower
courts
in
their
awaiting
the
outcome
of
the
military
decision
before
going
forward
on
the
precise
issue
that
is
involved
before
the
military?
this
of
course
essentially
is
grounded
on
considerations
of
comity.
the
court
has
frequently
stated
that
civilian
court
should
not
intervene,
if
there
is
an
available
remedy
within
the
military
court
system
and
if
that
remedy
might
provide
the
relief
which
the
petitioners
is
seeking
in
the
civilian
courts.
the
reason
of
course
is
that
the
petitioner
may
well
be
successful
in
the
military
courts
and
in
that
event
it
would
be
absolutely
no
need
for
the
civilian
courts
to
get
involved
at
all,
thus
avoiding
any
needless
friction
between
the
two
separate
judicial
systems.
further,
this
is
not,
at
this
point
in
time,
a
situation
where
the
civilian
court
has
said
they
cannot
act
on
this
matter.
it
rather,
truly
is
more
on
only
of
timing.
in
this
case,
the
issue
is
involved
in
the
military
proceedings,
the
court-martial
proceedings,
which
are
in
the
military
judicial
courts
and
decision
there
on
precisely
the
same
standard
as
is
supplied
in
the
civilian
courts
can
be
expected.
and,
the
decision
below
only
is
to
await
that
decision
before
it
goes
forward.
mr.
william
terry
bray
our
position
there
i
believe
mr.
justice
white,
would
be
that
he
can
go
ahead
and
get
heard
and
decide
in
the--
mr.
william
terry
bray
that
is
right,
that
is
it
all
it
is
at
this
point
in
time.
that
is
all
it
is
ever
been.
mr.
william
terry
bray
principally,
that
is
what
involved.
we
believe
there
are
some
additional
factors
involved
but
that
is
the
basic
one,
which
was
before
this
court
in
gusik
and
noyd
versus
bond.
mr.
william
terry
bray
the
policy
of
the
military,
as
stated
that
we
think,
properly
stated
in
the
regulation
in
our
appendix.
when
a
civilian
court
determines
that
a
serviceman
was
improperly
denied
discharge
without
a
basis
and
fact,
the
military
system
will
discharge
him
on
that
ground,
regardless
of
the
outcome
of
the
military
litigation.
mr.
william
terry
bray
no,
i
am
saying
that
even
if
there
were
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
a
final
determination
from
the
court
of
military
appeals
and
then
the
civilian
courts
held
that
he
was
entitled
to
discharge
--
the
military
would
discharge.
indeed,
the
goguen
decision
that
also
is
reproduced
in
our
appendix,
involved
a
very
similar
circumstance
where
the
claim
had
been
denied
through
the
court
of
military
review
and
was
pending
in
the
court
of
military
appeals
when
the
civilian
court
acted
and
the
court
of
military
appeals
dismissed
the
suit
on
the
ground
that
the
issue
had
been
decided
by
the
civilian
courts
and
a
fellowship
therefore
be
discharged.
mr.
william
terry
bray
the
same
result
would
follow,
the
servicemen
would
be
discharged
on
the
basis
of
the
civilian
court's
order.
mr.
william
terry
bray
that
has
not
been
--
either
their
policy
as
stated
by
the
regulation
or
their
policy
in
practice.
they
have
processed
the
discharge
properly
in
those
circumstances.
mr.
william
terry
bray
they
have
not
done
that
and
as
a
matter
of
their
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
could
they
do
that?
mr.
william
terry
bray
there
suppose
could
be
an
argument
made
that
once
that
the
two
systems
are
completely
autonomous
and
once
a
decision
has
been
made
in
the
military
system,
it
cannot
be
reviewed
in
the
civilian
courts,
at
all.
we
do
not
make
that
argument
in
this
case.
mr.
william
terry
bray
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
terry
bray
absolutely
not
mr.
justice
brennan
that
is
a--
mr.
william
terry
bray
we
certainly
have
not
and
we
would
not--
mr.
william
terry
bray
i
do
not
mean
to
suggest
that
it
is
about
my
client.
the
position
of
the
government
is
that
even
though
a
decision
had
been
handed
down
by
the
court
of
the
military
appeals,
the
highest
court
that
would
not
be
binding
in
the
subsequent
habeas
corpus
action
in
the
district
court,
the
civilian
district
court.
and,
that
the
court
then
could
order,
could
find
that
there
was
no
basis
in
fact,
in
order
of
discharge
and
if
the
army
would
properly
discharge
the
fellow
on
that
basis.
mr.
william
terry
bray
i
do
not
think
that
is
right
for
--
let
me
explain
to
you,
this
case
i
think
indicates
what
the
remedy
should
and
would
be
in
that
circumstance.
the
military
man
is
not
going
to
be
subjected
to
orders
that
--
or
should
not
be
subjected
to
orders,
which
are
inconsistent
with
his
claimed
status.
here,
the
district
court
tried
to
protect
him
on
that
basis
and
entered
a
protective
order
barring
the
army
from
ordering
him
to
do
things
of
a
greater
degree
than
what
he
was
doing.
psychological
counseling.
he
was
going
to
vietnam
to
be
a
psychological
counselor
and
the
civilian
judiciary
by
the
ninth
circuit
and
by
the
circuit
justice
determined
that
was
no
greater
burden
on
him
than
what
he
had
been
doing
in
california.
and
thus,
refused
to
stay
the
order.
if
on
the
other
hand,
he
was
given
an
order
to
use
an
example
to
go
take
a
rifle
training
or
something
of
that
sort
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
that
is
right.
now,
it
is
not
a
denial--
mr.
william
terry
bray
mr.
justice
marshall
let
me
suggest
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
that
is
not
what
i
mean.
mr.
william
terry
bray
for
two
reasons,
first
of
all,
the
army
--
there
are
means
of
challenging
the
army’s
order
before
he
is
subjected
to
court-martial
just
as
the
petitioner
here
attempted
to
do
and
then
unilaterally,
on
his
own,
he
decided
that
the
order
could
not
be
obeyed
by
him
and
did
not
obey
it.
after
the
civilian
courts
had
an
opportunity
to
review
it
and
refused
to
stay
it.
secondly,
the
order
involved
here
is
one
that
grew
directly
out
of
the
army’s
denial
of
his
application.
they
would
not
have
transferred
him
to
vietnam
or
anywhere
else
for
that
matter.
if
so
long
as
that
application
was
pending.
thus
the
order
itself
is
inextricably
caught
up
in
the
claim
and
for
that
reason
he
can
defend
it.
and,
for
that
reason
the
military
courts
have
decided
to
accept
a
collateral
challenge
to
a
administrative
determination
within
the
military
and
consider
whether
or
not
that
administrative
action
has
any
basis
in
fact.
that
of
course
is
precisely
the
issue
which
he
is
presenting
to
the
civilian
courts
now
by
means
of
habeas
corpus
and
we
think
the
military
court
should
be
able
to
go
forward.
there
are
--
i
think
some
other
reasons
that
involved
here
besides
the
comity
alone,
which
suggest
letting
the
military
system
run
its
course
before
the
court
below
acts
as
it
has
done.
mr.
william
terry
bray
subject
to
that
court’s
control,
yes
sir
just
as
what
happened
here.
mr.
william
terry
bray
i
believe
he
could.
there
is
nothing
that
would
prevent
the
military
from
transferring
him
wherever
it
is
all
fit,
so
long
as
its
--
either
its
regulations
did
not
prohibit
and
they
would
not
in
that
circumstance
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
william
terry
bray
well,
of
course
here
the
petitioner
sought
to
have
his
transfer
stayed,
because
he
was
concerned
that
the
courts
would
loss
jurisdiction,
which
would
seem
to
me
to
imply
that
he
did
not
have
anything
other
than
a
court
order
to
keep
him
from
being
transferred.
the
court
refused
to
stay
it
on
the
ground
one
that
army
agreed
to
bring
him
back
into
the
judicial
district
if
he
won
on
appeal
and
further
under
the
protective
order
that
the
court
is
previously
in.
mr.
william
terry
bray
the
army’s
position
is
that
no
duty
station
transfer
will
be
ordered
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
to
a
co.
mr.
william
terry
bray
that
is
right.
mr.
william
terry
bray
it
is
a
regulation.
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
terry
bray
the
claim
would
be
the
same
as
has
been
made
at
this
point
in
time
that
is
that
the
administrative
determination
was
without
basis
in
fact
and
that
the
order
which
in
sued
and
for
which
disobedience
of
which
he
was
convicted,
grew
directly
out
of
that.
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes,
the
claim
is
that
without
a
basis
in
fact
he
has
been
denied
due
process
of
law
and
that
has
been
accepted
in
the
courts,
at
this
point
in
time,
but
we
are
not
disputing
it
here.
mr.
william
terry
bray
that
is
correct,
the
court-martial’s
attitude
is
that
if
the
order
grew
out
of
the
administrative
denial
and
that
is
without
basis
in
fact
then
the
order
itself--
mr.
william
terry
bray
i
would
presume
it
would,
yes
sir.
the
regulation
is
binding
on
the
military
statute.
mr.
william
terry
bray
speaking
of
course
for
petitioner
here,
but
my
understanding
of
his
position
is
and
this
has
been
accepted
in
the
courts
generally
that
the
denial
of
administrative
remedy
available
within
the
military
that
does
not
have
basis
in
fact
is
a
denial
of
the
due
process.
that
is
a
constitutional
claim
that
entitles
to
him
to
have
it
set
aside.
but,
we
have
not
as
i
say
i
challenged
that
in
this
court
or
elsewhere
at
this
point
in
time.
the
other
aspects
of
this,
which
indicate
to
us
that
the
district
court
below
was
quite
proper
in
awaiting
the
outcome,
of
course
are
tied
up
in
the
fact
that
this
is
a
court-martial
proceeding
that
the
petitioner
did
on
his
own
decide
to
disobey
an
order
that
he
had
received
prior
approval
at
least
in
the
sense
of
refusing
to
stay
it
by
the
civilian
system.
and,
that
this
goes
to
the
very
heart
of
what
a
military
system
is
all
about
and
the
obedience
and
duty
that
are
necessary
to
that
system.
the
military
should
be
able
to
go
forward
with
its
disciplinary
actions
and
try
to
decide
the
issue
itself.
further,
the
underlying
issue
of
course
is
the
administration
of
the
army’s
regulations.
the
military
law
that
is
involved
in
this
case,
while
the
military
courts
do
not
have
any
peculiar
expertise
with
respect
to
the
basis
in
fact
test.
a
test
that
it
will
be
applied
in
the
collateral
review
of
the
administrative
determination,
they
do,
we
submit,
have
expertise
with
regard
to
the
military
generally
and
the
military's
administration
of
its
regulations
and
thus,
might
well
be
able
to
bring
knowledge
to
bare
on
this
questions,
as
well
as
give
guidelines
that
might
promote
uniformity
within
the
military
itself
or
the
administration
of
this
regulation.
all
of
which
suggests
that
the
military
be
allowed
to
go
forward.
further,
we
are
not
persuaded
by
the
petitioner’s
arguments
that
there
has
been
a
wrongful
denial
here
and
such
that
it
should
be
set
aside.
first,
let
me
emphasize
that
this
is
not
a
question.
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
the
court-martial
proceedings
had
not
been
brought
when
the
habeas
corpus
action
came
before
the
court
for
its
action.
here,
the
petitioner
had
disobeyed
the
order
and
the
court-martial
was
imminent
at
the
time
the
district
court
considered
the
habeas
corpus
petition
on
its
merits.
while
the
court
have
previously
stated
its
consideration
of
it
that
had
been
in
terms
of
letting
the
administrative
proceedings
run
their
course
and
that
was
a
matter,
separate
and
apart
from
the
court-martial
itself.
now,
this
of
course
distinguishes
this
case
from
the
second
circuit's
case
of
hammond
versus
lenfest.
and,
our
policy
is
in
agreement
with
the
hammond
position.
that
is
that
where
they
are
no
court-martial
proceedings
pending,
there
is
no
exhaustion
required
within
the
military
tribunals.
that
is
shown
in
our
appendix,
i
believe
it
is
at
page
61
and
that
is
our
policy
position
on
this
that
we
will
not
require
that,
but
we
consider
the
two
cases
significantly
different.
secondly,
the
delay
involved
in
this
case
of
course
is
inherent
in
the
exhaustion
doctrine
itself.
the
whole
purpose
of
it
as
a
part
of
this
case
is
merely
to
postpone,
the
action
by
the
civilian
courts,
until
such
time
as
the
military
has
a
chance
to
clean
its
own
house
if
that
is
required.
if
a
mistake
has
been
made
and
to
pass
on
the
same
issue
that
is
before
the
civilian
courts.
the
underlying
issue
of
the
validity
of
the
administrative
determination,
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
is
a
conscientious
objector
of
course
is
very
much
alive.
it
is
not
conceded
by
us
at
this
point
in
time
and
it
is
not
conceded
on
this
record
that
he
is
entitled
to
his
conscientious
objector
claim.
that
is
still
a
matter
before
competent
tribunals,
all
be
it
military
ones
at
this
point
in
time
in
our
judgment.
just
as
it
was
at
the
time
the
stay
was
denied
by
mr.
justice
douglas
in
december
of
1969.
finally,
the
delay
which
a
petitioner
has
gone
through
here
is
something
which
we
do
not
find
particularly
burdensome
on
him,
because,
the
order
of
district
court
of
course,
has
been
enforced
throughout
this
period,
he
could
not
have
been
subjected
to
government
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
military
duties
any
greater
than
his
psychological
counseling
duties
at
the
time
this
all
started.
further--
mr.
william
terry
bray
where
is
he
now?
he
is
at
home
now,
to
my
knowledge.
at
least
he
is
not
on
any
military
reservation
precinct
to
orders.
he
has
finished
serving
his
confinement
which
was
remitted
partially
and
his
own
excess
leave
status,
which
means
that
he
is
outside
of
the
military
in
present
time,
although
subject
to
its
jurisdiction,
until
such
time
as
the
decision
from
the
military
tribunals
is
final.
mr.
william
terry
bray
is
he
getting
paid?
i
do
not
believe
if
he
is
getting
paid.
this
excess
leave
status
does
not
count,
is
not
charged
against
him
as
leave
time.
it
is
not
credited
against
his
service
in
the
military
and
i
would
understand
from
that
he
is
not
paid
during
the
time
either.
there
would
have
been
means,
whereby
he
could
have
gotten
out
of
confinement
during
his
time,
had
he
sought
to
do
so.
the
records,
we
have
been
able
to
check,
indicate
that
he
did
not
seek
to
do
so.
although,
the
standard
on
which
he
would
have
done
so,
is
essentially
a
discretionary
one
up
to
his
commanding
officer
both
wherever
he
is
held
in
confinement.
as
well
as,
the
convening
authority
so
long
as
it
has
jurisdiction
over
it.
yet
he
could
have
applied
for
that
and
did
not.
in
any
event,
as
i
say
the
confinement
is
not
what
he
was
complaining
of,
it
was
rather
activities
inconsistent
with
the
co
claim.
lastly,
if
i
can
mention
briefly,
we
do
think
of
course
that
there
are
remedies
within
the
military
system
for
petitioner,
both
with
respect
to
the
consideration
of
the
issue,
which
he
has
brought
before
the
court.
we
think
it
is
beyond
doubt
that
issue
will
be
considered
in
the
military
tribunals
as
it
has
so
far
been
considered.
it
was
considered
on
the
merits
by
the
court-martial
itself,
while
that
authority
found
that
it
was
--
that
the
administrative
denial
was
not
an
abuse
of
discretion.
we
think
it
has
--
for
all
practical
purposes,
which
essentially
the
same
is
the
basis
in
fact
and
it
is
very
clear
that
the
court
before
which
the
appeal
is
now
pending,
the
court
of
military
review
will
consider
on
that
test.
mr.
william
terry
bray
on
the
basis
and
fact
test.
the
goguen
decision,
which
is
in
our
appendix,
very
clearly
states
that--
mr.
william
terry
bray
it
is
covered
in
our
brief
and
also
covered
in
the
goguen
decision
which
is
reproduced
as
appendix
d
at
our
brief
and
the
base,
the
test,
which
the
military
will
apply,
this
has
been
a
developing
area,
the
regulations
themselves
are
very
recent
origin
having
coming
into
being
in
1962.
but,
the
test
has
developed
and
it
is
very
clear
now
that
the
test
that
will
be
applied
is
a
basis
and
fact
test,
exactly
the
same
as
that
applied
in
the
civilian
courts.
that
is
the
holding
of
goguen
that
it
will
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
let
me
refer
you
to
page
39,
as
well
mr.
justice
douglas
and
particularly
that
footnote.
while
the
court-martial
itself
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes,
sir
i
am
sorry.
are
you
referring
to
the
appendix?
i
am
referring
to
our
brief
at
pages
39
and
40.
while
the
court-martial
itself
stated
that
it
would
consider
this
as
not
being
an
arbitrary
unreasonable
abuse
of
discretion,
as
we
say
there,
we
do
not
think
that
really
is
any
different
from
a
basis
and
fact
test
and
in
any
event
that
is
the
matter
which
undoubtedly
will
be
corrected
if
any
error
would
be
committed
there
by
the
court
of
military
review,
which
is
fully
competent
to
correct
this,
since
is
really
a
legal
decision.
mr.
william
terry
bray
no,
no.
the
court
of
military
review
is
a
mandatory
review
and
that
is
where
(voice
overlap)
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes,
well
it
has
chosen
--
it
had
stated
that
it
will
review
conscientious
objector
claims,
also
as
a
mandatory
matter
and
that
is
where
the
case
is
now.
that
the
certiorari
type
jurisdiction
is
in
the
court
of
military
appeals,
the
third
step
in
the
proceedings.
but
the
goguen
decision,
in
our
appendix,
is
a
court
of
military
review.
the
same
court
before
which
he
now
has
his
appeal
pending
and
it
is
clear
from
that
decision
that
the
test
will
be
precisely
the
same
as
that
applied
on
the
civilian
courts.
lastly,
we
think
that
the
he
will,
as
a
practical
matter,
receive
the
relief.
he
is
requested
in
the
district
court.
if
he
wins
in
the
military
courts,
he
will
be
discharged.
we
think
that
not
only
as
a
matter
of
our
regulations,
but
also
as
a
matter
of
the
court's
supervisory
powers
in
any
event
the
district
court
here
has
retained
jurisdiction
only
until
the
court-martial
is
final.
that
would
occur
when
the
decision
--
when
a
filed
decision
is
reached
in
the
military
tribunals
and
at
that
point
in
time
if
he
has
not
gotten
the
relief
he
wishes,
surely
the
district
court
would
grant
it
to
him.
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
terry
bray
as
i
say,
i
am
not
sure
what
kind
of
habeas
it
is
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
--
that
is
the
petitioner’s
case.
my
understanding
of
the
basis
on
which
this
was
brought
in
the
court
is
--
that
he
has
been
denied
due
process
of
law,
because
the
administrative
determination
is
without
basis
and
fact.
mr.
william
terry
bray
it
is
not
a
2225--
mr.
william
terry
bray
counsel
advises
that
the
action
was
brought
under
section
2241.
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes
sir,
they
are
certainly
are.
mr.
william
terry
bray
the
articles
reproduced
in
our
appendix
that
established
these
courts.
articles
66
and
67
as
military
courts
and
these
are
holdings
to
that
fact.
mr.
william
terry
bray
well,
this
is
not
an
attack
on
the
court-martial.
this
is
an
attack
on
the
administrative
determination
and
our
position
is
that
the
collateral
attack
on
the
administrative
determination
is
pending
in
the
military
courts
in
connection
with
a
court-martial
proceeding.
and,
that
comity
as
well
as
other
consideration
suggests
that
the
civilian
courts
not
act
until
that
is
completed.
mr.
william
terry
bray
that
is
correct.
am
i
advised
by
counsel?
thank
you
very
much.
