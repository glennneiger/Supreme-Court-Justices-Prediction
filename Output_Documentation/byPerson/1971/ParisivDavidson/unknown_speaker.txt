unknown
speaker
was
exhaustion
have
met
going
all
the
way
through
the
court
of
military
appeals?
unknown
speaker
does
that
include
the
court
of
military
appeals?
unknown
speaker
can
you
just
briefly
tell
me
what
are
the
steps
in
military
appellate
process?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
time
limit
in
the
steps
within
which
the
convening
authority
has
to
complete
that
review?
unknown
speaker
is
that
appeal
of
right?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
that
too
would
have
to
be
exhausted
before
they
could
proceed
with
the
--
unknown
speaker
well,
but
would
that
step
also
have
to
be
exhausted
before
it
could
come
in
civil
--
unknown
speaker
now
with
that
is
there
any
provision
in
the
military
process
for
staves
and
being
sent
to
vietnam
or
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
any
provision
for
staves
pending
the
completion
of
all
this
military
appellate
review?
unknown
speaker
well,
no
one
has
attempted
to
put
him
into
combat?
unknown
speaker
then
they
just
transferred
the
location
of
his
non-combative
--
unknown
speaker
now
where
is
that?
is
he
in
prison?
unknown
speaker
what
is
that?
unknown
speaker
he
is
at
home
or
where
is
he?
unknown
speaker
how
much
of
the
sentence
is
served?
unknown
speaker
so
that
is
18
months
all
through.
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
sentence?
unknown
speaker
6
months
or
more
has
been
remitted.
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
reference
to
that
in
the
governments
brief?
just
to
remember
that.
unknown
speaker
i
want
to
be
sure
that
we
have
what
you
are
quoting
from--if
that
is
the
one
we
want
to
look
at
later.
unknown
speaker
where
is
the
--
in
what
state
is
the
administrative
procedure
application?
unknown
speaker
for--
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
is
that
been
exhausted--
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
beyond
that
he
can
go
where?
unknown
speaker
on
a
conviction,
he
can
go
through
the
-–
unknown
speaker
from
there
he
can
go
--
unknown
speaker
and,
the
court
of
military
appeals
exercised
sort
of
certiorari
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
well,
this
order
was
totally
consistent,
i
understand
with
the
tentative
conclusion
at
least
of
the
ninth
circuit
justice.
justice
douglas
that
such
an
order
would
not
put
him
any
closer
to
acting
military
activities,
is
that
correct?
and
he
would
not
--
he
knew
that.
unknown
speaker
it
caused
me
a
little
bit
trouble
here
that
this
disobedience
of
an
order,
was
something
separate
and
apart
from
his
conscientious
objector
claims.
at
least
in
the
tentative
view
of
those
members
of
the
judiciary
who
had
said
his
moving
him
to
vietnam
to
continue
this
holy
non
military
activity
in
the
army,
that
was
not
inconsistent
with
his
conscientious
objector
claim
and
not
--
no
different
from
his
caring
on
the
same
basic
non
military
activity
with
the
army
here
state
side.
unknown
speaker
but
if
the
order
had
been,
what
if
the
order
had
been
totally
unrelated
to
any
conceivable
claim
of
conscientious
objection,
such
as
could
pick
up
that
toothbrush
or
could
have
that
cigarette
butt.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
the
mean
time
there
were
--
let
us
assume
my
kind
of
case
and
there
was
a
prosecution
for
willful
failure
to
disobey
a
lawful
order.
then,
if
he
won
in
the
united
states
district
court
on
habeas
corpus
then
he
could
never
be
prosecuted
for
that
because
he
could
be
a
civilian.
unknown
speaker
i
wonder--
i
would
like
to
appreciate
an
answer
to
my
question
in
your
own
way
--
unknown
speaker
intervening
military
prosecution?
unknown
speaker
mr.
goff,
would
you
have
the
same
argument
if
the
crime
he
was
accused
of,
the
military
crime,
he
had
committed
was
stealing
a
car
or
murder?
unknown
speaker
presumably
conviction
of
a
--
for
such
a
crime
would
mean
a
discharge
anyway
and
dishonorable?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
he
has
committed
a
crime
which
is
unrelated
to
the
conscientious
objector.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bray,
what
if
instead
of
the
--
an
order
to
go
vietnam,
the
violation
of
an
order
to
go
to
vietnam,
what
if
the
military
prosecution
had
been
as
my
brother
white
suggested
before,
stealing
the
money
from
a
fellow
soldier,
what
would
your
position
be,
and
if
otherwise
everything
was
as
it
is
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
what
would
be
the
result
in
my
hypothetical--?
unknown
speaker
no,
just,
had
there
been
a
conviction
and
it
was
on
appeal,
as
i
say
all
the
other
fact
as
they
are
in
this
case
except
that
the
offense
which
he
was
charged
was
stealing,
was
larceny
rather
than
violation
of
an
order
to
go
vietnam.
unknown
speaker
what
would
your
position
be
in
my
hypothetical
case
with
respect
to
the
timing
of
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
in
the
federal
district
court?
all
it
is
that
outside
of
your
argument,
that
the
only
issue
here
is
one
of
timing,
is
one
of
plan.
unknown
speaker
well,
now
in
this
case
as
i
understand
it,
according
at
least
to
the
tentative
view
of
the
circuit
justice
and
of
the
others
who
passed
on,
this
order
was
not
inconsistent
with
his
claim
of
conscientious
objection
and
so,
to
that
extent
it
is
equivalent
in
law
to
the
offense
of
stealing
and
it
is
unrelated
to
his
claim
of
conscientious
objection.
that
is
what
mr.
justice
douglas
in
effect
held
tentatively
at
circuit
justice.
unknown
speaker
well,
any
violation
in
the
service
would
be
direct
or
indirect
result
of
the
army's
refusal
to
let
him
out.
he
would
not
be
in
the
army
to
receive
an
order
to
pick
up
a
cigarette
if
he
had
been
released
as
a
conscientious
objector,
would
he?
unknown
speaker
except
i
wonder
if
he
should
try
to
interpose
the
defense
of
--
as
he
did
in
this
court-martial
proceeding
and
it
was
disallowed,
because
the
trial
court
held
that
there
was
a
basis
and
fact
for
the
administrative
decision.
not
allowing
his
conscientious
objector
claim,
but
i
suppose
on
appeal,
it
could
very
well
be
argued
that
this
not
a
relevant
defense
to
this
order
anyway
since
it
is
already
been
held
by
this
one
member
of
this
court
in
a
tentative
way
that
the
order
was
quite
consistent
with
his
conscientious
objector
claim.
and
therefore,
disobedience
of
the
order,
he
cannot
justify
disobedience
of
the
order
on
the
basis
of
his
conscientious
objection.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
the
military
conviction?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
are
merely
saying
the
defendant
then
has
the
choice
of
the
forum.
unknown
speaker
you
can
either
putting
his
defense
in
the
military
court,
which
is
he
then
--
it
must
be
exhausted
there
or
he
can
forgo
the
defense
and
take
the
risk
and
go
to
the
federal
court,
which
defends
that
aside
his
court-martial
conviction.
unknown
speaker
how
about
res
judicata,
generally
speaking
that
is
a
doctrine
that
is
inapplicable
to
habeas
corpus,
as
we
both
know,
but
the
defense
to
the
court-martial
is
not
a
habeas
corpus
and
let
us
assume
that
it
was
determined
by
the
court
of
the
military
appeals
that
the
defense
is
invalid,
because
there
was
a
basis
in
fact
for
the
administrative
denial
of
his
conscientious
objector
claim.
now,
that
would
be
in
a
case
between
the
united
states
and--that
between
the
united
states
army
and
this
man,
parisi.
now,
could
have
that
any
res
judicata
effect
in
a
subsequent
habeas
corpus
hearing
in
the
federal
district
courts?
unknown
speaker
so
this
is
the
opposite
--
unknown
speaker
a
final
determination.
unknown
speaker
it
was
in
my
case,
i
am
assuming
a
prior
determination
by
the
court
of
the
military
appeals
that
there
is
a
basis
in
fact.
unknown
speaker
and,
how
about
--
would
the
army
interpose
the
defense
to
the
habeas
corpus
action
and
he
sort
of
reached
to
a
counter
defense?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
talking
about
that
conviction
in
our
case,
the
parisi's
case,
there
has
been
a
conviction.
let
us
assume
now
it
is
affirmed
on
appeal
all
the
way
up
and
upon
a
finding
that
there
was
in
fact,
a
basis
for
denying
his
conscientious
objector
claim.
now,
you
say
this
case
involves
only
a
matter
of
plan,
a
matter
of
timing.
so
now,
the
federal
habeas
corpus
proceeding
goes
forward
in
the
federal
district
court
with
the
army
command
and
say,
“mr.
district
judge
we
have
a
defense
to
this
action,
because
it
has
been
determined
by
the
highest
military
authority
that
there
was
a
basis
in
fact
for
denying
this
man
discharge.”
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
function
of
habeas
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
even
suggest
that
it
might
--?
alright
now,
--
unknown
speaker
this
is
where
you
abduct
your
theory
and
tomorrow
the
man
could
exhaust
every
military
administrative
procedure
on
a
serial
claim
and
loses,
and
notifies
that
he
is
going
for
habeas,
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
transfer
him
to
vietnam.
unknown
speaker
he
has
been
ordered
to
be
transferred
to
florida
or
some
other
place,
without
any
increase
in
(inaudible)
and
he
refused
that
orders
and
then
the
army
that
he
was
court-marshaled,
whether
that
would
be
the
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
in
just
a
matter
of--
unknown
speaker
it
is
just
a
matter
of
military
law.
unknown
speaker
is
it
a
regulation
or--?
unknown
speaker
well,
may
i
ask
you
mr.
bray.
unknown
speaker
i
guess
for
federal
detention,
the
habeas
remedy
is
available,
not
alone
for
constitutional
denial
for
those
who
have
the
violation
to
federal
laws,
then
how
they
affect
(inaudible).
have
you
suggested
that
the
habeas
remedy
would
be
available
to
--
after
he
had
exhausted
the
administrative
remedies
and
the
court-martial
remedy
and
all
of
that,
would
be
available,
at
that
point
in
time,
to
review
this.
now,
what
would
be
the
claim
in
habeas,
that
the
determination
and
court-martial
has
violated
a
constitutional
right
or
a
statute--the
federal
statute,
what
would
it
be?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
--
what
did
that
stem
from,
it,
must
be
a
basis
in
fact
or
a
denial
of
conscientious
objector.
is
that
constitutional
or
is
that
--?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
source
of
the
setting
aside
the
court-martial
conviction
that
the
co
claim
is
sustained,
is
that
a
fact
--
i
guess
that
was
basically
the
court-martial
enforcing
a
military
regulation.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that
regulation
to
enforce
a
statute
--
unknown
speaker
what
handle
under
the
federal
habeas
corpus
then
bring
the
suit?
unknown
speaker
where
is
he
now?
unknown
speaker
they
are
getting
paid?
unknown
speaker
on
what
test?
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
clear
at
all
about
that,
i
assumed
you
have
covered
it
from
your
brief,
but
i
miss
something,
i
have
been
looking
for
--
the
military
standard
of
conscientious
objector
and
our
decision
in
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
that
is
a
certiorari
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
on
conscientious
objector?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
puzzled
about,
what
kind
of
habeas
this
is?
this
is
certainly
not
2225.
unknown
speaker
the
reason
i
asked
is
2255
requires
a
selective
procedure
under
that
section
--
unknown
speaker
in
any
court
by
the
congress.
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
original
habeas?
unknown
speaker
why
the
military
court
established
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
on
the
basis
of
2225
--
unknown
speaker
well,
why
is
habeas
corpus
--
i
am
just
--
i
am
not
judging
in
the
--
but
on
page
55
it
is
said
that
application
for
an
habeas
corpus
will
not
be
entertained
unless,
the
2255
--
the
2255
remedy
has
been
sought
in
the
court
would
sentence
those
--
unknown
speaker
this
is
a
habeas
corpus.
i
appreciate
you
are
being
asked
in
a
way
to
speak
for
your
brother
on
the
other
side.
but,
i
assume
this
is
brought
under
title
28,
the
united
states
code
2241.
unknown
speaker
what
would
you
say
those
times
of
the
administrative
procedure
through
this
office
of
the
secretary
has
been
completed
by
what
date?
unknown
speaker
on
what
basis
is
the
habeas
--
unknown
speaker
yes,
i
trying
to
get
the
date.
unknown
speaker
now,
when
was
the
order
--
disobedience
of
which
he
was
court-martialed?
unknown
speaker
after
the
filling
of
the
habeas
corpus?
unknown
speaker
so,
there
is
the
habeas
petition
then
which
pending
when
the
order
was
issued,
he
disobeyed
the
order
and
then
the
court-martial
proceedings.
unknown
speaker
the
suspension
was
because
that
he
had
not
gone
to
the
board
for
correction
--
unknown
speaker
now,
before
the
proceedings
before
that
board
had
been
completed
that
the
order
was
issue
and
he
disobeyed
it.
unknown
speaker
and
so
while
that
was
pending
before
the
board
for
correction
of
military
regulation
--
unknown
speaker
had
the
court-martial
begun
before
that
board
had
completed
its
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
was
very--the
military
proceeding
had
begun
--
unknown
speaker
when
was
the
court-martial
conviction?
unknown
speaker
1970?
unknown
speaker
and
it
is
still
pending
on
the
military
court
review,
there
has
been
a
great
deal
of
delay
there
why?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
--
and
these
extension
is
sought
by
the
petitioners
counsel,
who
ought
to
understand,
there
is
not
--
different
counsel
for
what
on
what
grounds
or
for
what
--
unknown
speaker
that
court
is
not
being
asked
to
stay
--
pending
the
determination
of
this
case,
is
it
or
is
not
it?
unknown
speaker
was
exhaustion
have
met
going
all
the
way
through
the
court
of
military
appeals?
unknown
speaker
does
that
include
the
court
of
military
appeals?
unknown
speaker
can
you
just
briefly
tell
me
what
are
the
steps
in
military
appellate
process?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
time
limit
in
the
steps
within
which
the
convening
authority
has
to
complete
that
review?
unknown
speaker
is
that
appeal
of
right?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
that
too
would
have
to
be
exhausted
before
they
could
proceed
with
the
--
unknown
speaker
well,
but
would
that
step
also
have
to
be
exhausted
before
it
could
come
in
civil
--
unknown
speaker
now
with
that
is
there
any
provision
in
the
military
process
for
staves
and
being
sent
to
vietnam
or
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
any
provision
for
staves
pending
the
completion
of
all
this
military
appellate
review?
unknown
speaker
well,
no
one
has
attempted
to
put
him
into
combat?
unknown
speaker
then
they
just
transferred
the
location
of
his
non-combative
--
unknown
speaker
now
where
is
that?
is
he
in
prison?
unknown
speaker
what
is
that?
unknown
speaker
he
is
at
home
or
where
is
he?
unknown
speaker
how
much
of
the
sentence
is
served?
unknown
speaker
so
that
is
18
months
all
through.
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
sentence?
unknown
speaker
6
months
or
more
has
been
remitted.
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
reference
to
that
in
the
governments
brief?
just
to
remember
that.
unknown
speaker
i
want
to
be
sure
that
we
have
what
you
are
quoting
from--if
that
is
the
one
we
want
to
look
at
later.
unknown
speaker
where
is
the
--
in
what
state
is
the
administrative
procedure
application?
unknown
speaker
for--
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
is
that
been
exhausted--
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
beyond
that
he
can
go
where?
unknown
speaker
on
a
conviction,
he
can
go
through
the
-–
unknown
speaker
from
there
he
can
go
--
unknown
speaker
and,
the
court
of
military
appeals
exercised
sort
of
certiorari
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
well,
this
order
was
totally
consistent,
i
understand
with
the
tentative
conclusion
at
least
of
the
ninth
circuit
justice.
justice
douglas
that
such
an
order
would
not
put
him
any
closer
to
acting
military
activities,
is
that
correct?
and
he
would
not
--
he
knew
that.
unknown
speaker
it
caused
me
a
little
bit
trouble
here
that
this
disobedience
of
an
order,
was
something
separate
and
apart
from
his
conscientious
objector
claims.
at
least
in
the
tentative
view
of
those
members
of
the
judiciary
who
had
said
his
moving
him
to
vietnam
to
continue
this
holy
non
military
activity
in
the
army,
that
was
not
inconsistent
with
his
conscientious
objector
claim
and
not
--
no
different
from
his
caring
on
the
same
basic
non
military
activity
with
the
army
here
state
side.
unknown
speaker
but
if
the
order
had
been,
what
if
the
order
had
been
totally
unrelated
to
any
conceivable
claim
of
conscientious
objection,
such
as
could
pick
up
that
toothbrush
or
could
have
that
cigarette
butt.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
the
mean
time
there
were
--
let
us
assume
my
kind
of
case
and
there
was
a
prosecution
for
willful
failure
to
disobey
a
lawful
order.
then,
if
he
won
in
the
united
states
district
court
on
habeas
corpus
then
he
could
never
be
prosecuted
for
that
because
he
could
be
a
civilian.
unknown
speaker
i
wonder--
i
would
like
to
appreciate
an
answer
to
my
question
in
your
own
way
--
unknown
speaker
intervening
military
prosecution?
unknown
speaker
mr.
goff,
would
you
have
the
same
argument
if
the
crime
he
was
accused
of,
the
military
crime,
he
had
committed
was
stealing
a
car
or
murder?
unknown
speaker
presumably
conviction
of
a
--
for
such
a
crime
would
mean
a
discharge
anyway
and
dishonorable?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
he
has
committed
a
crime
which
is
unrelated
to
the
conscientious
objector.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bray,
what
if
instead
of
the
--
an
order
to
go
vietnam,
the
violation
of
an
order
to
go
to
vietnam,
what
if
the
military
prosecution
had
been
as
my
brother
white
suggested
before,
stealing
the
money
from
a
fellow
soldier,
what
would
your
position
be,
and
if
otherwise
everything
was
as
it
is
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
what
would
be
the
result
in
my
hypothetical--?
unknown
speaker
no,
just,
had
there
been
a
conviction
and
it
was
on
appeal,
as
i
say
all
the
other
fact
as
they
are
in
this
case
except
that
the
offense
which
he
was
charged
was
stealing,
was
larceny
rather
than
violation
of
an
order
to
go
vietnam.
unknown
speaker
what
would
your
position
be
in
my
hypothetical
case
with
respect
to
the
timing
of
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
in
the
federal
district
court?
all
it
is
that
outside
of
your
argument,
that
the
only
issue
here
is
one
of
timing,
is
one
of
plan.
unknown
speaker
well,
now
in
this
case
as
i
understand
it,
according
at
least
to
the
tentative
view
of
the
circuit
justice
and
of
the
others
who
passed
on,
this
order
was
not
inconsistent
with
his
claim
of
conscientious
objection
and
so,
to
that
extent
it
is
equivalent
in
law
to
the
offense
of
stealing
and
it
is
unrelated
to
his
claim
of
conscientious
objection.
that
is
what
mr.
justice
douglas
in
effect
held
tentatively
at
circuit
justice.
unknown
speaker
well,
any
violation
in
the
service
would
be
direct
or
indirect
result
of
the
army's
refusal
to
let
him
out.
he
would
not
be
in
the
army
to
receive
an
order
to
pick
up
a
cigarette
if
he
had
been
released
as
a
conscientious
objector,
would
he?
unknown
speaker
except
i
wonder
if
he
should
try
to
interpose
the
defense
of
--
as
he
did
in
this
court-martial
proceeding
and
it
was
disallowed,
because
the
trial
court
held
that
there
was
a
basis
and
fact
for
the
administrative
decision.
not
allowing
his
conscientious
objector
claim,
but
i
suppose
on
appeal,
it
could
very
well
be
argued
that
this
not
a
relevant
defense
to
this
order
anyway
since
it
is
already
been
held
by
this
one
member
of
this
court
in
a
tentative
way
that
the
order
was
quite
consistent
with
his
conscientious
objector
claim.
and
therefore,
disobedience
of
the
order,
he
cannot
justify
disobedience
of
the
order
on
the
basis
of
his
conscientious
objection.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
the
military
conviction?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
are
merely
saying
the
defendant
then
has
the
choice
of
the
forum.
unknown
speaker
you
can
either
putting
his
defense
in
the
military
court,
which
is
he
then
--
it
must
be
exhausted
there
or
he
can
forgo
the
defense
and
take
the
risk
and
go
to
the
federal
court,
which
defends
that
aside
his
court-martial
conviction.
unknown
speaker
how
about
res
judicata,
generally
speaking
that
is
a
doctrine
that
is
inapplicable
to
habeas
corpus,
as
we
both
know,
but
the
defense
to
the
court-martial
is
not
a
habeas
corpus
and
let
us
assume
that
it
was
determined
by
the
court
of
the
military
appeals
that
the
defense
is
invalid,
because
there
was
a
basis
in
fact
for
the
administrative
denial
of
his
conscientious
objector
claim.
now,
that
would
be
in
a
case
between
the
united
states
and--that
between
the
united
states
army
and
this
man,
parisi.
now,
could
have
that
any
res
judicata
effect
in
a
subsequent
habeas
corpus
hearing
in
the
federal
district
courts?
unknown
speaker
so
this
is
the
opposite
--
unknown
speaker
a
final
determination.
unknown
speaker
it
was
in
my
case,
i
am
assuming
a
prior
determination
by
the
court
of
the
military
appeals
that
there
is
a
basis
in
fact.
unknown
speaker
and,
how
about
--
would
the
army
interpose
the
defense
to
the
habeas
corpus
action
and
he
sort
of
reached
to
a
counter
defense?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
talking
about
that
conviction
in
our
case,
the
parisi's
case,
there
has
been
a
conviction.
let
us
assume
now
it
is
affirmed
on
appeal
all
the
way
up
and
upon
a
finding
that
there
was
in
fact,
a
basis
for
denying
his
conscientious
objector
claim.
now,
you
say
this
case
involves
only
a
matter
of
plan,
a
matter
of
timing.
so
now,
the
federal
habeas
corpus
proceeding
goes
forward
in
the
federal
district
court
with
the
army
command
and
say,
“mr.
district
judge
we
have
a
defense
to
this
action,
because
it
has
been
determined
by
the
highest
military
authority
that
there
was
a
basis
in
fact
for
denying
this
man
discharge.”
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
function
of
habeas
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
even
suggest
that
it
might
--?
alright
now,
--
unknown
speaker
this
is
where
you
abduct
your
theory
and
tomorrow
the
man
could
exhaust
every
military
administrative
procedure
on
a
serial
claim
and
loses,
and
notifies
that
he
is
going
for
habeas,
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
transfer
him
to
vietnam.
unknown
speaker
he
has
been
ordered
to
be
transferred
to
florida
or
some
other
place,
without
any
increase
in
(inaudible)
and
he
refused
that
orders
and
then
the
army
that
he
was
court-marshaled,
whether
that
would
be
the
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
in
just
a
matter
of--
unknown
speaker
it
is
just
a
matter
of
military
law.
unknown
speaker
is
it
a
regulation
or--?
unknown
speaker
well,
may
i
ask
you
mr.
bray.
unknown
speaker
i
guess
for
federal
detention,
the
habeas
remedy
is
available,
not
alone
for
constitutional
denial
for
those
who
have
the
violation
to
federal
laws,
then
how
they
affect
(inaudible).
have
you
suggested
that
the
habeas
remedy
would
be
available
to
--
after
he
had
exhausted
the
administrative
remedies
and
the
court-martial
remedy
and
all
of
that,
would
be
available,
at
that
point
in
time,
to
review
this.
now,
what
would
be
the
claim
in
habeas,
that
the
determination
and
court-martial
has
violated
a
constitutional
right
or
a
statute--the
federal
statute,
what
would
it
be?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
--
what
did
that
stem
from,
it,
must
be
a
basis
in
fact
or
a
denial
of
conscientious
objector.
is
that
constitutional
or
is
that
--?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
source
of
the
setting
aside
the
court-martial
conviction
that
the
co
claim
is
sustained,
is
that
a
fact
--
i
guess
that
was
basically
the
court-martial
enforcing
a
military
regulation.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that
regulation
to
enforce
a
statute
--
unknown
speaker
what
handle
under
the
federal
habeas
corpus
then
bring
the
suit?
unknown
speaker
where
is
he
now?
unknown
speaker
they
are
getting
paid?
unknown
speaker
on
what
test?
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
clear
at
all
about
that,
i
assumed
you
have
covered
it
from
your
brief,
but
i
miss
something,
i
have
been
looking
for
--
the
military
standard
of
conscientious
objector
and
our
decision
in
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
that
is
a
certiorari
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
on
conscientious
objector?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
puzzled
about,
what
kind
of
habeas
this
is?
this
is
certainly
not
2225.
unknown
speaker
the
reason
i
asked
is
2255
requires
a
selective
procedure
under
that
section
--
unknown
speaker
in
any
court
by
the
congress.
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
original
habeas?
unknown
speaker
why
the
military
court
established
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
on
the
basis
of
2225
--
unknown
speaker
well,
why
is
habeas
corpus
--
i
am
just
--
i
am
not
judging
in
the
--
but
on
page
55
it
is
said
that
application
for
an
habeas
corpus
will
not
be
entertained
unless,
the
2255
--
the
2255
remedy
has
been
sought
in
the
court
would
sentence
those
--
unknown
speaker
this
is
a
habeas
corpus.
i
appreciate
you
are
being
asked
in
a
way
to
speak
for
your
brother
on
the
other
side.
but,
i
assume
this
is
brought
under
title
28,
the
united
states
code
2241.
unknown
speaker
what
would
you
say
those
times
of
the
administrative
procedure
through
this
office
of
the
secretary
has
been
completed
by
what
date?
unknown
speaker
on
what
basis
is
the
habeas
--
unknown
speaker
yes,
i
trying
to
get
the
date.
unknown
speaker
now,
when
was
the
order
--
disobedience
of
which
he
was
court-martialed?
unknown
speaker
after
the
filling
of
the
habeas
corpus?
unknown
speaker
so,
there
is
the
habeas
petition
then
which
pending
when
the
order
was
issued,
he
disobeyed
the
order
and
then
the
court-martial
proceedings.
unknown
speaker
the
suspension
was
because
that
he
had
not
gone
to
the
board
for
correction
--
unknown
speaker
now,
before
the
proceedings
before
that
board
had
been
completed
that
the
order
was
issue
and
he
disobeyed
it.
unknown
speaker
and
so
while
that
was
pending
before
the
board
for
correction
of
military
regulation
--
unknown
speaker
had
the
court-martial
begun
before
that
board
had
completed
its
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
was
very--the
military
proceeding
had
begun
--
unknown
speaker
when
was
the
court-martial
conviction?
unknown
speaker
1970?
unknown
speaker
and
it
is
still
pending
on
the
military
court
review,
there
has
been
a
great
deal
of
delay
there
why?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
--
and
these
extension
is
sought
by
the
petitioners
counsel,
who
ought
to
understand,
there
is
not
--
different
counsel
for
what
on
what
grounds
or
for
what
--
unknown
speaker
that
court
is
not
being
asked
to
stay
--
pending
the
determination
of
this
case,
is
it
or
is
not
it?
