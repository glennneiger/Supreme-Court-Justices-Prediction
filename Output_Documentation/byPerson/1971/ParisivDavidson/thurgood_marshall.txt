(inaudible)
in
that
case
he
had
put
in
no
defense
in
the
court-martial?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
he
had
not
put
in
any
defense,
would
he
still
be
barred
from
the
habeas
corpus?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
this
is
not
unable,
he
just
said
i
will
not
put
in
any
defense,
then
how
can
you
say
that
grows
out
of
the
order?
grows
out
of
the
seal
business.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
could
you
say
if
then,
he
puts
in
no
defense?
justice
thurgood
marshall
your
only
point
of
denying
the
federal
court
jurisdiction
on
habeas
corpus
is
of
the
fact
that
he
has
been
questioned,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
that
is
if
in
the
future
any
time
somebody
wants
to
go
on
to
federal
court,
is
through
court-martial,
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
hope
you
do
not
mean
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
should
not.
