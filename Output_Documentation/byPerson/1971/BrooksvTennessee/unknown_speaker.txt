unknown
speaker
to
the
court?
unknown
speaker
mr.
summers.
unknown
speaker
mr.
summers,
in
tennessee
if
you
push
the
defendant
on
first,
may
he
also
be
use
in
rebuttal?
unknown
speaker
and
may
he
be
used
in
rebuttal
even
though
it
doesn't
take
the
stand
on
his
own
defense?
unknown
speaker
are
there
some
court
of
appeals
that
follow
this
rule?
unknown
speaker
that's
the
sixth
circuit?
unknown
speaker
mr.
summers,
before
you
do,
if
you
were
to
prevail
here,
do
you
feel
you
are
entitled
to
a
new
trial
or
merely
for
a
remand
for
consideration
of
whether
prejudice
existed.
unknown
speaker
what
happens
if
they
don't?
does
the
prosecution
collapse?
unknown
speaker
even
though
it's
a
prosecuting
witness?
unknown
speaker
even
though
it's
by
definition
the
prosecuting
witness?
unknown
speaker
doesn't
that
mean
there
is
no
prosecution?
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand
you,
the
state
need
not
hear
the
prosecuting
witness
to
sit
at
the
witness
stand.
the
person
is
going
to
justify
that
she
was
the
victim
or
he
was
the
victim,
if
the
state
wants
to
choose
somebody
else
to
sit
at
the
trial
table,
right?
unknown
speaker
if
it's
that
person
who
wants
to
testify
first
or
not
at
all?
unknown
speaker
would
you
spell
out
for
me
where
the
prejudice
exist
as
you
tried
this
case?
unknown
speaker
i
know
what
your
theory
is,
my
question
is
was
there
prejudice
in
this
case
and
could
you
so
prove
if
necessary?
unknown
speaker
[voice
overlap]
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
follow
up
on
justice
blackmun's
question
a
little
bit.
i
take
your
initial
tactical
decision
was
that
you
got
two
witnesses
you
are
going
to
call
if
they
go
well
so
to
speak,
you're
not
going
to
call
your
own
client,
then
you
put
those
two
witnesses
on.
now,
how
did
they
go?
unknown
speaker
even
if
your
client
had
testified
first,
you
wouldn't
have
been
able
to
respond
the
detective's
testimony.
unknown
speaker
now
i
go
back
to
my
other
question.
supposed
you
have
put
him
on
and
then
you
put
the
detective
on
and
then
you
wanted
to
have
him
respond
to
what
the
detective
had
testified
to,
could
you
then
put
him
back
on?
unknown
speaker
well
then
where
is
your
prejudice
now?
unknown
speaker
but
this
is
a
not
guilty
plea,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
and
i
suppose
if
--
unless
he
was
going
to
change
his
plea
to
guilty
if
he
got
on
the
stand
he
would
have
denied
the
commission
of
the
offense,
would
he?
unknown
speaker
and
if
one
can
assume
that
as
i
suppose
it
can.
the
jury
might
have
believe
that
and
then
if
he
wasn't
able
to
get
on
the
stand
and
testify
that
he
hadn't
it,
i
suppose
it's
been
hard
to
say
that
you
can't
show
there's
no
prejudice
in
the
case.
unknown
speaker
wasn't
that
guilty
plea?
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
case
relied
on
by
judge
mcalester
in
dissent
in
the
shipp
case?
unknown
speaker
at
what
stage?
rebutting
the
states?
unknown
speaker
at
surrebuttal,
this
is
technical
sentence
though,
and
wouldn't
it
had
been
a
proper
argument
to
the
state
to
make
if
you
try
to
call
him
on
surrebuttal
after
the
state
put
on
rebuttal
to
answer
this
testimony
that
you
had
brought
out
on
your
own
case
on
the
defense
that
this
is
a
legitimate
surrebutal.
i
mean
even
though
in
tennessee
you
could
testify,
your
client
could
testify
in
surrebuttal,
wouldn't
the
state
have
had
an
objection
if
you
try
to
produce
your
client
on
surrebutal
on
this
case
just
to
refute
what
the
officer
that
have
said
when
you
had
it
understand
as
drugs.
unknown
speaker
the
officer
was
your
witness
as
i
understand
it.
unknown
speaker
you
weren't
allowed
to
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
can
rebut
your
own
testimony
and
evidence?
unknown
speaker
mr.
summers
don't
misunderstand
me.
i
don't
think
much
of
your
system.
what
i'm
concerned
in
about
is
whether
it's
unconstitutional.
unknown
speaker
your
summary
just
boils
down
in
the
part
of
the
record
that
you
read
to
us.
the
state
in
this
case
offered
the
way
of
the
statute
and
the
court
was
unwilling
to
do
so?
how
is
--
is
it
a
fairly
frequent
occasion
that
the
statute
is
waived
by
agreement
parties
in
the
court
or
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
just
as
here?
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
when
it
was
in
tennessee,
that
defendants
were
--
became
privileged
to
testify?
unknown
speaker
and
it’s
never
been
changed?
unknown
speaker
now
it’s
being
challenged
here?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
defendant
has
a
constitutional
right
to
testify
in
his
own
behalf?
unknown
speaker
ferguson
against
georgia,
i
think
held
whatever
that
he
does,
doesn’t
it
--
didn’t
he?
unknown
speaker
do
you
claim
he’s
on
conditional
right
to
some
extent?
unknown
speaker
do
you
now
what
law
was
involved
in
the
ninth
circuit
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean
he
was
in
the
party.
unknown
speaker
and
this
rule,
doesn’t
he?
unknown
speaker
general
kendrick,
is
the
--
are
witnesses
sequestered
in
all
criminal
cases
routinely
in
tennessee
even
if
no
motion
is
made
to
do
so?
unknown
speaker
do
the
parties
want
the
rule?
unknown
speaker
that
we
do
and
then
--
until
its
done?
unknown
speaker
well,
let’s
assume
that
the
defendant
wants
to
call
a
police
officer
like
he
did
in
this
case
and
the
police
officer
hasn’t
testified?
unknown
speaker
in
the
criminal
case
in
tennessee?
unknown
speaker
assume
that
isn’t
so
and
the
--
unknown
speaker
you
want
to
call
the
chief
of
police.
unknown
speaker
it’s
been
under
subpoena
by
the
state
to
come
to
trial
when
the
state
have
chosen
not
to
put
him
on
so
the
defendant
ask
the
court
i
would
like
to
put
him
on
and
treat
him
as
a
hostile
witness
and
the
court
said,
sorry,
if
you
call
him,
he’s
your
witness.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
the
question
is
you
really
don’t
know
where
you
stand,
do
you,,
on
your
defense?
unknown
speaker
that
was
the
case
in
this
case,
that
was
the
situation
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
the
chief
was
under
subpoena
by
the
state.
he
had
to
testify.
he
asked
the
court
to
let
him
cross
examine
and
said,
no,
if
you
call
him
he’s
your
witness.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
fact
is
though
that
you
really
sometimes
can’t
know
what
your
defense
is
--
what
the
witnesses
you
want
to
call,
that
you
are
going
to
risk
calling
and
really
going
to
say
(voice
overlap)
hold
up
under
cross
examination.
unknown
speaker
you
think
a
--
you
think
that
was
ferguson
held?
is
that
a
constitutional
(voice
overlap).
unknown
speaker
that
was
the
right
to
counsel?
unknown
speaker
to
the
court?
unknown

mr.
summers.
