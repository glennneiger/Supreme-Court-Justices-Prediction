mr.
jerry
h.
summers
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
petitioner
donald
brooks
who
was
convicted
of
the
offense
of
armed
robbery
on
the
laws
of
the
state
of
tennessee
and
sentence
to
10
years
in
state
penitentiary.
because
i
consider
this
to
be
a
novel
question
of
law,
i
would
like
to
very
briefly
spend
some
time
on
the
facts
of
this
particular
case.
the
sole
question
which
the
court
has
issued
has
granted
certiorari
is
to
whether
the
--
is
on
the
question
of
whether
the
trial
court
was
in
error
in
refusing
to
allow
the
defendant
to
be
placed
on
the
witness
stand
after
other
witnesses
testified
in
his
behalf
under
tennessee
code
section
40-2403
as
said
tennessee
statute
requiring
defendant
to
be
the
first
witness
is
unconstitutional
in
violation
of
the
fifth,
sixth,
and
fourteenth
amendments
of
the
federal
constitution
in
article
1,
section
9
of
the
tennessee
constitution.
this
question
is
presented
into
two
phrases
and
the
other
section
was
said
the
code
section
40-2403
deprives
a
defendant
of
due
process
of
law
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
united
states
constitution.
now
this
question,
the
statute
that
involved
for
this
particular
matter
was
enacted
in
tennessee
in
1887.
i
would
like
to
very
briefly
present
to
what
matter
in
which
this
case
--
this
question
was
raise
at
the
trial
court
and
to
do
that,
i
would
very
briefly
like
to
direct
your
attention
to
pages
1
through
3
of
the
appendix
in
which
is
an
excerpt
of
the
transcript
of
the
testimony
of
that
particular
trial.
from
the
page
1,
my
question
regard
to
a
motion
that
court
have
decided
in
the
presence
of
the
jury.
i
know
your
honor
of
course
they
submitted
for
the
record,
i
know
what
the
law
is
but
it
is
something
that
i
would
like
to
reserve
for
the
record.
at
this
time
of
course
you
realize
we
have
a
statute
in
tennessee
which
states
that
the
defendant
has
to
testify
first.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
that's
right.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
i
would
like
for
the
purpose
of
the
record
to
get
to
my
client
at
this
time,
i
do
not
feel
that
i
know
whom
you
want
or
not.
and
i
would
like
--
i
have
two
other
witnesses,
i
have
another
witness,
two
more
witnesses.
i
use
chief
points
to
put
on
the
stand
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
right
to
call
mr.
brooks
after
they
have
testified.
if
the
fact
should
want
and
that's
my
motion
i
would
like
to.
the
court
in
oppose
it
well
at
this
time
the
assistant
district
attorney
general
mr.
donald
pugh
interposed
who
said,
"sir,
we'll
waive
the
statute
if
you
would
waive
the
statute."
the
court
responded,
"no
sir,
i
am
going
to
follow
the
law.
the
law
is
as
you
know
it
to
be
that
if
defendant's
testifies
he
has
to
testify
first
and
so
doing
the
recess
you
can
consider
that.
do
you
have
anything
else
to
bring
before
the
court
before
recess?"
i
made
other
motions
and
recess
was
taken
and
we
came
back
after
short
recess
and
the
court
saying
further."
mr.
summers,
you
do
want
this
witness
to
testify
and
that
you're
not
going
to
use
the
defendant,
is
that
correct?"
in
my
response,
"not
at
this
time,
your
honor,
i
will."
the
court
interposes
it,
"well,
i
want
on
your
motion
on
that.
so
in
other
words
if
you
intend
to
let
the
defendant
brooks
testify,
you
will
have
to
be
first."
mr.
summers,
"your
honor,
of
course
i
understand
the
course
ruling
of
this,
i
would
like
to
the
purpose
of
the
record
like
i
explained
i
would
like
to
later
move
put
him
on
again
if
i
should
decide.
i'll
do
without
the
presence
of
the
jury
then.
the
court:
"well,
no
i
have
already
approved
on
that
but
i
am
just
again
reminding
you
in
case
you
have
thought
about
it
again.
if
you're
going
to
use
him,
if
you
want
to
testify
in
his
own
behalf
you
will
have
to
do
it
now."
"alright,
your
honors,
we
respectfully
note
the
exceptions."
this
is
the
matter
in
which
this
question
was
raised
in
the
trial
court.
very
briefly,
i
would
like
to
read
for
you
the
statute
which
is
involved
in
this
particular
matter.
in
1887,
the
tennessee
general
assembly,
in
part
of
the
entire
statute
entitled
"enact
to
forfeit
party
defendants
in
criminal
cases
to
testify
in
their
own
behalf."
the
statute
is
actually
two-fold.
the
first
is
40-2402
which
gave
the
defendant
the
right
to
become
a
witness
on
his
behalf.
as
the
second
part
of
the
statute
which
is
40-2403
which
the
court
has
granted,
and
that
means
failure
of
defendant
to
testify
-
order
of
testimony.
the
failure
of
the
party
to
testify
in
his
own
behalf
shall
not
create
any
presumption
against
him
but
the
defendant
assigned
to
testify
shall
do
so
before
any
other
testimony
for
the
defense
is
heard
by
the
court
trying
the
case.
now
the
statute
prior
to
1887,
the
defendant
was
incompetent
to
testify
in
his
own
behalf
in
the
state
of
tennessee
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
your
honor,
there
is
a
case
that
is
cited
in
the
brief
which
i
believe
is
clemens
versus
state
which
held
that
he
could
testify
in
rebuttal.
this
statute
enacted
in
1887
in
conjunction
with
40-2402
is
my
contention
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute
of
the
legislators
at
that
time
was
that
40-2403
was
to
be
a
safety
vow.
because
of
this
with
a
new
concept
in
the
--
i
have
cited
in
brief
ferguson
versus
georgia
in
which
mr.
justice
brennan
cites
to
history
in
history
of
the
right
of
a
defendant
to
testify
and
that
this
was
a
new
concept
in
1887.
this
had
just
been
recent
enacted
in
several
states
for
granting
to
defense
the
right
to
testify.
in
tennessee,
it
is
my
opinion
that
the
reason
this
was
enacted
was
as
a
safety
vow
because
it
was
a
fear
and
it's
cited
by
whitmore
(ph)
in
the
brief
and
the
state
relies
on
it
considerably
in
their
brief
that
it
was
that
--
this
would
incur
perjury
that
it
would
give
a
defendant
the
opportunity
and
they
would
be
afraid
that
he
would
color
his
testimony
having
the
right
to
sit
there
as
a
witness
after
witness
standing
hearing
his
own
witnesses
testify
and
then
mold
or
adopt
his
testimony.
now
this
was
the
-
actually
it
was
raised
and
the
tennessee
adopted
the
statute
in
1887.
it
is
our
contentions
that
this
cite
in
the
brief
that
under
the
constitutional
grounds
that
this
fear
of
the
legislature
is
not
sufficient
that
the
constitutional
violation
is
in
the
fifth,
fourteenth
and
sixth
amendments
of
united
states
constitution
article
1,
section
9
overcome
this
and
make
it
imperative
that
we
ask
the
court
to
reverse
this
conviction
and
declare
this
statute
unconstitutional.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
justice
stewart
the
tennessee
and
kentucky
are
the
only
two
states
and
these
are
some
of
the
reasons
that
i
would
like
to
urge
the
point
while
i
am
urging
that
this
decision
be
declared
unconstitutional.
tennessee
and
kentucky
are
the
only
two
states
at
my
research
have
been
able
to
find
and
the
state
agrees
to
have
this
type
of
statute.
now
there
is
of
course
there
is
no
federal
rule
and
this
federal
rule
that
requires
this
and
18
u.s.c.a.
3481
allows
the
defendant
to
testify.
that's
the
federal
statute
granting
him
to
accomplish
and
to
testify,
there
is
nothing
that
states
when
he
must
testify.
this
is
not
the
rule
in
several
cases
in
tennessee.
a
plaintiff
does
not
have
to
be
the
first
witness.
a
defendant,
there
is
no
such
rule
as
this
is
requiring
order
to
testimony
in
a
civil
case
--
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
your
honor
in
the
--
there
is
one
decision,
the
u.s.
versus
shipp
which
is
359
federal
second
185
has
held
that
it
is
--
held
that
it
was
a
matter
of
discretion
within
the
court
as
to
allow
that
was
not
abuse
of
discretion
to
allow
the
trial
court
to
control
the
order
of
testimony.
that
is
cited
the
state
relies
upon
that
case
very
heavily.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
yes,
sir.
i
would
like
to
refer
to
that
just
for
a
moment,
i
believe
there
is
distinction.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
your
honor,
we
respectfully
feel
that
we
should
be
entitled
to
a
new
trial.
i
also
like
to
point
out
that
and
it's
not
cited
in
the
brief
and
i
ask
the
court
because
that's
only
reason
that
come
to
my
attention
that
a
special
committee
of
the
tennessee
legislature
pointed
by
the
governor
has
made
direct.
in
tennessee
we
are
presently
studying
to
revise
our
criminal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
to
completely
revamp
the
rules
in
tennessee.
that
a
special
committee
appointed
by
the
governor
and
the
legislature
has
recommended
that
this
statute
be
repealed
in
the
state
of
tennessee
which
gives
the
right
3003
as
the
second
if
even
a
--
either
a
defendant
or
the
state
request
it,
the
judge
may
exclude
from
the
hearing
of
trial
any
witnesses
of
the
first
party
not
the
time
under
examination
so
he
may
not
hear
the
testimony
of
other
witnesses.
this
provision
shall
not
apply
to
the
defendant,
the
attorneys
in
the
case
or
the
first
witness
for
the
state.
and
in
the
comment
that
it
says
the
purpose
of
this
section
is
to
replace
the
current
t.c.a.
40-2403
which
forces
the
defendant
to
testify
first
with
defense
if
he
intends
to
testify
at
all.
it
is
felt
that
defendant
should
be
allowed
to
testify
anytime
if
he
wishes
and
do
not
lose
the
right
to
be
heard
merely
because
he
does
not
testify
first.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
there
is
no
statute
which
requires
that
but
there
is
appellant
there
as
a
case
law
to
that
effect.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
they
speak
-
then
with
the
statute
this
was
also
discussed
under
this
amendment
also
mr.
justice
and
it
held
that
the
proposed
section
which
i
read
would
in
fact
allow
the
state
to
choose
a
witness
that
it
wanted
to
help
with
the
case.
the
state
would
merely
put
its
most
helpful
witness
on
the
stand
first,
that
is
what
they
proposed
under
the
statute.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
your
honor
under
the
coding
of
the
smartt
case
that
this
is
-
they
would
not
be
allowed
to
use
that
witness.
that
is
the
only
as
i
understand.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
sir?
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
yes,
sir.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
i
think
that
yes
sir
that
normally
this
case
that
cited
this
was
the
smartt
decision
which
is
derived
upon
in
the
governments
and
the
states'
brief
is
a
very
old
case
also
as
all
of
these
cases
relying
upon
this
argument.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
yes,
sir.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
yes,
your
honor.
it's
very
often
they
will
use
a
police
officer
who
handle
the
detective
who
handles
the
case
and
he
will
be
designated
as
the
prosecutor
and
he
sits
there
at
the
witness
stand.
i'm
not
saying
that
this
question
that
you
have
brought
up
is
not
very
often
raised,
in
fact
many
times
that
prosecutor
will
not
testify
or
it's
not
a
statutory
requirement.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
no,
your
honor,
i
moved
--
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
yes,
i
did
later
on.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
yes
sir,
i
did.
i
called
two
witnesses
your
honor.
one
of
the
detective
who
is
prosecuting
witness
in
this
matter
who
had
i
think
in
an
original
assignment
there
as
i
raised
a
confession
question
and
a
lineup
question
which
you
do
not
grant
certiorari
on.
but
the
detective
who
had
conducted
the
lineup
which
this
young
man
was
picked
out.
he
was
not
called
by
the
state
as
a
witness.
now
i
called
him
as
a
witness
for
the
--
they
relied
merely
upon
the
identification
of
the
victim.
i
called
the
detective
who
conducted
the
lineup
as
my
own
witness.
i
further
called
an
inmate
in
the
jail
who
had
been
--
was
in
the
same
lineup.
i
called
those
two
witnesses
that
i
put
on.
now,
the
court
may
want
--
did
i
renew
my
motion
after
they
had
testified.
i
did
not
do
that
and
i
felt
like
the
courts
ruling
in
itself.
i
have
certainly
felt
like
that
it
would
been
improper
for
me
to
do
so.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
no,
sir.
they
did
not
put
on
any
in
rebuttal
after
i
put
on
my
few
witnesses.
i
felt
i
had
raised
this
question
and
two
or
three
other
cases
and
fortunately
i
got
acquittals
then
and
i
had
one
time
i
had
done
this
before
the
presence
of
the
jury,
i
called
my
move
to
call
him
and
then
of
course
the
court
said
no,
you
cannot
put
them
on
and
i
thought
that
i
did
not
do
in
this
case
because
i
thought
it
might
been
improper
because
you
got
it
before
the
jury
the
fact
that
why
can't,
why
can't
the
defendant
testify
and
so
i
did
not
do
it.
i
thought
it
would
be
improper.
i
did
one
time
and
i
thought
it
might
have
been
improper
that's
why
your
honor.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
yes,
your
honor.
this
is
very,
very
simply.
it
is
this,
the
prejudice
involves
that
as
you
all
know
and
it's
cited
in
williams
versus
florida
in
justice
black's
opinion
with
justice
black's
opinion.
a
lawsuit
is
not
--
you
can
no
matter
how
hard
you
compare
your
lawsuit,
no
matter
how
well
you
know
your
witnesses
know
him
that's
how
well
you
have
talked
to
the
government's
witnesses
or
the
states
witnesses.
a
lawsuit
can
change
and
it's
our
contention
that
my
client
to
--
that
my
theory
is
this.
that
to
make
me
choose
at
the
beginning
of
the
trial,
i
did
not
feel
that
they
got
state
and
made
out
our
sufficient
case
in
which
i
should
have
to
put
my
client
on
the
stand.
my
client
had
no
criminal
records
stipulated
in
there.
it
was
not
--
i
was
trying
to
keep
him
off
the
stand
because
he
got
along
with
the
criminal
record
which
is
normally
the
case.
but
i
have,
i
did
not
feel
that
they
could
--
that
i
should
have
to
put
him
on
but
the
prejudice
involved
is
that
if
doing
the
course
of
--
i
wanted
to
put
on
other
two
witnesses
which
would
have
my
side.
the
quest
--
the
problem
is
that
if
i
put
this
witnesses
on
and
something
happens
that
they're
--
the
state
in
some
way
affects
their
testimony
and
something
comes
out
which
can
only
be
explained
by
the
defendant
taking
the
stand
then
i
or
on
by
way
of
witness
stand
i
am
precluded
for
putting
under
tennessee
procedure.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
your
honor,
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
prejudice
in
this
particular
case
there
came
up
after
the
court
have
ruled
that
i
cannot
put
him
on
and
then
it
give
up.
i
cannot
--
the
prejudice
came
up
of
course
not
answering
because
of
the
fact
that
i
cannot
pretty
understand.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
no,
sir.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
well,
in
regard
to
the
way
that
they
win,
i
put
on
the
detective,
i
put
on
the
detective.
i
called
him
as
my
witness.
the
court
in
tennessee
would
not
--
the
trial
judge
would
not
to
declare
him
as
a
witness
and
i
put
to
him
on
this
question
as
to
the
fact
that
this
was
a
very
highly
suggestive
lineup
in
which
this
young
man
had
been
arrested
for
other
charges,
his
picture
has
been
on
tv
and
this
detective
made
the
statement
that
when
he
called
this
prosecution
witness
to
come
down
here.
come
on
down
here,
we
got
the
boy
that
held
up
the
store
and
my
client
indicate
that
he
was
present
when
that
took
place.
this
came
out
on
putting
on
this
states
witness
who
i
had
to
call
myself
because
they
did
not
put
him
on.
therefore
this
situation
can
only
if-the
rebuttal
of
this
could
only
have
been
by
my
particular
client.
and
my
client,
i
could
not
rebut
this,
the
statement
that
when
the
--
when
i
put
the
detective
on
in
question
about
the
lineup
and
he
denied
this
it
could
only
be
rebutted
by
my
client
and
my
client
could
not
take
the
stand.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
no,
your
honor,
i
did
not.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
yes,
sir.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
yes,
sir.
i
think
it
certainly
would
have
it
at
that
time.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
no
sir
because
i
--
well
i
have
to
put
him
on
--
i
put
him
on
as
my
own
witness
and
of
course
i
have
made
it
in
the
situation
why
i
would
be
cross
examining
my
own
witness,
but
i
would
at
least
make
an
attempt
to
put
him
on
under
the
statute,
i
can
even
attempt
to
put
him
on.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
no
sir,
not
under
the
state
of
tennessee
procedure,
i
could
not.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
well,
your
honor
the
--
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
yes,
it
was.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
yes,
sir.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
yes,
sir.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
yes
it
was,
it
was
not
guilty
plea
and
he
was
tried
by
jury
and
the
jury
convicted
him.
as
i
stated,
they
urged
various
little
case
law
on
this
proposition.
the
case
is
-
it's
a
very
new
situation
where
that
the
abstaining
case
on
fully
petitioner
is
bell
versus
mississippi
which
is
an
1895
case
in
which
this
was
held
that
--
this
did
not
rely
on
the
statute
but
it
held
that
it
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
and
improper
for
the
trial
court
to
require
that
defendant
to
be
the
first
witness.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
yes
sir,
it
is.
and
also
the
67
decision
of
nassif
versus
dc
which
cites
the
bell
case
and
the
bell
case
is
being
authority
and
very
link
the
opinion
which
states
in
effect
that
it
was
still
good
law,
it
was
a
proper
rule
in
1885
by
the
mississippi
court
and
the
dc
court
followed
it
in
1967.
now,
we
also
--
we
take
the
position
that
the
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
of
this
statute
is
unconstitutional
and
it
denies
the
defendant
the
right
to
testify
in
a
criminal
case.
the
--
we
submit
that
under
this
--
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
well,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
our
contention
is
that
we
have
alleged
into
this
matter
that
under
the
sixth
amendment
we
are
contending
is
that
--
it
is
been
held
by
the
court
that
he
is
entitled
to
the
guiding
hand
of
the
counsel.
now
as
stated
by
mr.
blackmun
in
the
william
versus
florida
case
which
stated
very
briefly
that
the
law
changes
quite
frequently,
the
--
in
the
trial
of
lawsuit
which
he
said
that
any
lawyer
who
has
actually
tried
the
case
knows
that
regardless
of
demand
of
pretrial
preparation,
the
case
looks
far
different
when
it
is
actually
being
tried
and
when
it
is
only
been
thought
about.
we
say
that
this
statute,
how
the
prejudice
comes
back
is
that
if
the
pressure
--
the
burden
that
it
puts
upon
the
defendant
and
has
counsel
--
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
the
statute.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
the
statute.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
the
statute
precludes,
that
is
the
--
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
your
honor,
in
the
brief
the
tennessee
decision
discusses
the
question
of
rebuttal.
the
--
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
may
i
have
this
one
moment
your
honor
and
think
that
i
can
--
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
your
honor,
in
the
case
of
arnold
versus
state
it
was
cited
in
the
brief
that
the
case
where
the
defendant
was
convicted
of
assault
with
intent
to
commit
murder
in
the
second
degree
and
this
case,
the
defendant
did
not
testify
in
the
defense
proof.
now
he
attempted
the
call
as
a
rebuttal
of
witness
which
his
client
-
it
seems
incidentally
be
called
as
rebuttal
witness
to
deny
that
the
defendant
and
his
attorney
had
offered
the
victim
$500.00
to
drop
the
case
as
the
fact.
now
the
supreme
court
in
that
case
declined
to
allow
the
defendant
to
testify
an
objection
by
the
state
and
of
course
in
our
state
the
supreme
court
held
that
it
was
error
for
the
defendant
not
to
be
able
to
be
called
as
a
rebuttal
witness.
so
as
to
the
question,
he
could.
i
may
misinformed
the
court
that
he
could
been
called
as
a
rebuttal
witness
but
the
situation
in
--
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
the
rebutting
the
states
proof
yes
sir.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
yes
sir,
they
would.
i
am
sure
that
they
would
have
--
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
yes.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
no
sir
i
was
not.
in
fact
i
asked
the
court
--
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
correct,
yes
sir.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
yes,
sir.
i
realize
that
and
we
in
this
matter
your
honor,
this
court
has
under
the
fifth
amendment
has
held
that
the
defendant
has
predicted
under
griffin
versus
california
that
the
defendant
has
a
constitutional
right
to
remain
silent.
now,
and
that
goes
that
case
was
dealing
with
comment
on
the
failure
to
testify.
we
respectfully
submit
that
this
procedure
that
we
have
in
the
state
of
tennessee
is
so
far
it
is
in
the
minority,
it
is
not
been
adopted
by
any
except
in
the
state
of
kentucky,
has
not
been
adopted
by
the
federal
rules,
it's
not
the
rule
in
civil
cases
as
i
respect
would
submit
that
the
real
issue
is
this.
in
this
case
is
whether
the
constitution
implies
or
states
that
the
defendant
has
the
right
to
be
heard
in
any
case.
we
respectfully
like
to
save
our
time
for
rebuttal
in
respect
to
--
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
your
honor,
this
particular
matter
has
been
brought
up.
i
brought
it
up
three
times
prior
to
this
case
and
i
was
fortunate
in
any
cases.
i
brought
it
up
last
friday
in
the
case
and
the
state
offered
to
waive
it
again.
the
court
would
not
allow
him
to
wait.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
yes
and
they
have
taken
the
position
now
that
they
were
not
allowed
to
waive.
now
this
has
been
the
position
of
our
trial
judge
there
in
chattanooga
at
the
times
that
i
have
tried
to
waive
this.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
i
feel
that
it
is
more
a
matter
of
procedure
your
honor
but
it
has
not
been
raised.
this
is
to
consider
a
statute
been
on
books
for
this
period
of
time
as
very
few
cases
has
been
raised.
now,
we
have
one
late
decision
which
came
out
of
chattanooga
and
another
attorney
raised
his
proposition
and
at
the
harvey
case
but
it
was
--
based
its
ruling
just
on
the
clemens
case
which
is
old
decision.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
yes,
your
honor
the
--
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
yes,
your
honor,
this
is
--
this
by
an
oversight
that
this
matter
when
it
came
up,
it
was
on
the
fifth,
the
fourteenth
and
sixth
amendment.
however,
there
is
a
provision
and
also
article
1,
section
9
of
the
tennessee
constitution
which
if
i
may
have
read
the
--
which
i
think
it's
similar
to
the
sixth
amendment
in
certain
respects,
the
right
of
the
accused
in
criminal
prosecution
on
page
three
of
the
brief
and
all
criminal
prosecutions,
the
accused
had
the
right
to
be
heard
by
himself
and
his
counsel
and
to
defend
the
nature
and
cause
of
accusation
against
him.
it
pertains
to
speedy
trials
and
should
not
be
compelled
to
give
evidence
against
himself.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
your
honor,
i
think
that
probably
it
should,
i
have
--
we
have
primarily
relying
on
the
fifth
and
the
fourteenth
amendments.
i
put
the
sixth
in
but
i
think
the
court
is
probably
correct
that
we
should
not
be
allowed
to
consider
it
but
i
think
because
of
the
similarity,
i
did
argue
the
sixth
in
this
matter.
thank
you.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
a
very
short
time
i
have
remaining,
i
would
like
to
elaborate
on
some
questions
that
was
asked
by
justices
yesterday.
the
first
one
that
pertain
to
question
by
the
chief
--mr.
chief
justice
in
regard
the
question
of
offer
of
proof.
your
honor,
yesterday
you
inquired
as
to
whether
i
should
have
made
an
offer
proof
and
in
this
matter
which
you
felt
would
possibly
affect
the
record
more
fully.
i
would
only
say
that
in
the
law
in
the
state
of
tennessee
is
that
if
an
entire
land
of
testimony
is
excluded
or
an
entire
witnesses’
testimony
is
excluded
then
it
is
not
necessary
to
make
an
offer
of
proof
under
our
laws
of
the
state
of
tennessee
to
protect
an
appeal.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
is
it
permitted?
yes,
sir.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
well,
it
should
be
within
discretion
of
the
courts.
there
has
been
a
recent
decision
in
the
criminal
court
which
allows
you
to
make
a
--
in
the
criminal
courts
they’ve
allowed
you
to
make
an
offer
of
proof.
but
that
was
--
decision
came
after
this
case
was
tried.
in
regards
to
mr.
rehn
--
mr.
justice
rehnquist’s
question
yesterday,
i
believe
that
in
discussion
at
the
time
for
rebuttal
and
surrebutal
got
jumbled
up
and
i
would
like
to
say
that
it
is
my
contention
under
the
law
that
the
scope
that
the
defendant,
if
he
was
not
allowed
to
testify
and
put
on
other
witnesses,
the
state
then
put
on
rebuttal
witnesses
to
testify
to
rebut
his
witnesses
that
he
could
testify
as
surrebutal
witnesses
but
the
scope
of
his
surrebutal
would
be
limited
to
those
matters
which
had
been
brought
out
on
the
states
rebuttal.
now,
we
say
that
that
does
not
alleviate
the
problem
created
by
the
statute.
if
he
could
be
a
surrebutal
witness
because
there
are
matters
which
certainly
we
would
like
to
--
should
be
submitted
to
the
court.
now,
in
this
matter
in
regards
to
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
question
as
to
privilege
as
to
yesterday,
if
this
court
should
declare
the
statute
unconstitutional,
it
would
be
the
burden
upon
the
state
to
show
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
under
the
far
holdings
of
this
court
that
the
area
was
promised
and
not
prejudicial.
now,
our
position
is
that
we
contend
that
nothing
can
be
more
prejudicial
than
a
statute
which
will
restrict
or
deny
a
defendant
from
testifying
his
own
behalf
and
if
this
statute
is
per
se
prejudicial.
we
say
that
the
defendant
has
a
right
to
testify
under
the
authority
of
a
--
absolute
right
under
ferguson
versus
georgia
and
in
closing
i
would
respectfully
say
that
we
think
that
--
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
i
think
--
i
read
it
by
implication
that
that
was
the
way
that
i
read
the
decision
this
--
that
--
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
yes
sir,
yes
it
was.
but
i
felt
the
reading
--
hat
was
the
interpretation
that
applying
ferguson
to
this
case
that
donald
brooks
has
an
absolute
right
to
testify
in
a
criminal
case
and
that
it
--
that
any
that
the
state
--
the
statute
state
of
tennessee
is
restricting
that
right
and
that
is
the
argument.
in
closing,
i
would
say
that
the
decisions
of
bell
versus
mississippi
and
of
shipp
which
have
been
cited
which
the
dissenting
opinion
of
judge
mcalister
we
think
present
a
logical
and
analytical
approach
to
this
to
the
problem,
we
respectfully
urge
the
court
to
reverse
the
conviction
and
declare
the
statute
unconstitutional.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
no,
you
do
not
your
honor.
i
respectfully
say
that
the
burden
--
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
your
honor,
i
would
say
no
because
they
urge
the
presumption
of
innocence
in
the
burden
of
proof
to
prove
guilt
is
upon
the
state
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
your
honor,
being
in
the
heat
of
battle
in
many
trials
i
would
say
and
knowing
how
your
trial
can
change,
i
would
be
reluctant
as
the
trial
counsel
to
--
until
i
had
heard
some
of
the
proof.
i
make
the
decision
quite
frequently
as
to
whether
my
--
to
put
my
client
on
the
stand
by
the
manner
in
which
the
states
approve
and
i
say
would
be
first
--
it
would
be
a
very
infrequent
case
which
i
would
put
my
client
on
because
we
do
not
have
full
discovery
in
the
state
of
tennessee,
we
have
very
limited
in
criminal
procedure
and
i
would
be
very
hesitant
to
put
my
client
on
the
stand
to
--
since
to
kill
the
prosecution
there
might
be
a
very
rare
case
in
which
it
might
be
such
as
a
matter
of
incest
in
which
you
–-
it
would
be
uncorroborated
testimony
of
an
accomplice
and
with
the
state
had
very
limited
--
a
very
weak
case.
but
i
would
be
very
reluctant
as
to
file
counsel
to
employ
such
a
tactic
because
i
can
foresee
it
could
backfire
very
readily.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
petitioner
donald
brooks
who
was
convicted
of
the
offense
of
armed
robbery
on
the
laws
of
the
state
of
tennessee
and
sentence
to
10
years
in
state
penitentiary.
because
i
consider
this
to
be
a
novel
question
of
law,
i
would
like
to
very
briefly
spend
some
time
on
the
facts
of
this
particular
case.
the
sole
question
which
the
court
has
issued
has
granted
certiorari
is
to
whether
the
--
is
on
the
question
of
whether
the
trial
court
was
in
error
in
refusing
to
allow
the
defendant
to
be
placed
on
the
witness
stand
after
other
witnesses
testified
in
his
behalf
under
tennessee
code
section
40-2403
as
said
tennessee
statute
requiring
defendant
to
be
the
first
witness
is
unconstitutional
in
violation
of
the
fifth,
sixth,
and
fourteenth
amendments
of
the
federal
constitution
in
article
1,
section
9
of
the
tennessee
constitution.
this
question
is
presented
into
two
phrases
and
the
other
section
was
said
the
code
section
40-2403
deprives
a
defendant
of
due
process
of
law
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
united
states
constitution.
now
this
question,
the
statute
that
involved
for
this
particular
matter
was
enacted
in
tennessee
in
1887.
i
would
like
to
very
briefly
present
to
what
matter
in
which
this
case
--
this
question
was
raise
at
the
trial
court
and
to
do
that,
i
would
very
briefly
like
to
direct
your
attention
to
pages
1
through
3
of
the
appendix
in
which
is
an
excerpt
of
the
transcript
of
the
testimony
of
that
particular
trial.
from
the
page
1,
my
question
regard
to
a
motion
that
court
have
decided
in
the
presence
of
the
jury.
i
know
your
honor
of
course
they
submitted
for
the
record,
i
know
what
the
law
is
but
it
is
something
that
i
would
like
to
reserve
for
the
record.
at
this
time
of
course
you
realize
we
have
a
statute
in
tennessee
which
states
that
the
defendant
has
to
testify
first.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
that's
right.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
i
would
like
for
the
purpose
of
the
record
to
get
to
my
client
at
this
time,
i
do
not
feel
that
i
know
whom
you
want
or
not.
and
i
would
like
--
i
have
two
other
witnesses,
i
have
another
witness,
two
more
witnesses.
i
use
chief
points
to
put
on
the
stand
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
right
to
call
mr.
brooks
after
they
have
testified.
if
the
fact
should
want
and
that's
my
motion
i
would
like
to.
the
court
in
oppose
it
well
at
this
time
the
assistant
district
attorney
general
mr.
donald
pugh
interposed
who
said,
"sir,
we'll
waive
the
statute
if
you
would
waive
the
statute."
the
court
responded,
"no
sir,
i
am
going
to
follow
the
law.
the
law
is
as
you
know
it
to
be
that
if
defendant's
testifies
he
has
to
testify
first
and
so
doing
the
recess
you
can
consider
that.
do
you
have
anything
else
to
bring
before
the
court
before
recess?"
i
made
other
motions
and
recess
was
taken
and
we
came
back
after
short
recess
and
the
court
saying
further."
mr.
summers,
you
do
want
this
witness
to
testify
and
that
you're
not
going
to
use
the
defendant,
is
that
correct?"
in
my
response,
"not
at
this
time,
your
honor,
i
will."
the
court
interposes
it,
"well,
i
want
on
your
motion
on
that.
so
in
other
words
if
you
intend
to
let
the
defendant
brooks
testify,
you
will
have
to
be
first."
mr.
summers,
"your
honor,
of
course
i
understand
the
course
ruling
of
this,
i
would
like
to
the
purpose
of
the
record
like
i
explained
i
would
like
to
later
move
put
him
on
again
if
i
should
decide.
i'll
do
without
the
presence
of
the
jury
then.
the
court:
"well,
no
i
have
already
approved
on
that
but
i
am
just
again
reminding
you
in
case
you
have
thought
about
it
again.
if
you're
going
to
use
him,
if
you
want
to
testify
in
his
own
behalf
you
will
have
to
do
it
now."
"alright,
your
honors,
we
respectfully
note
the
exceptions."
this
is
the
matter
in
which
this
question
was
raised
in
the
trial
court.
very
briefly,
i
would
like
to
read
for
you
the
statute
which
is
involved
in
this
particular
matter.
in
1887,
the
tennessee
general
assembly,
in
part
of
the
entire
statute
entitled
"enact
to
forfeit
party
defendants
in
criminal
cases
to
testify
in
their
own
behalf."
the
statute
is
actually
two-fold.
the
first
is
40-2402
which
gave
the
defendant
the
right
to
become
a
witness
on
his
behalf.
as
the
second
part
of
the
statute
which
is
40-2403
which
the
court
has
granted,
and
that
means
failure
of
defendant
to
testify
-
order
of
testimony.
the
failure
of
the
party
to
testify
in
his
own
behalf
shall
not
create
any
presumption
against
him
but
the
defendant
assigned
to
testify
shall
do
so
before
any
other
testimony
for
the
defense
is
heard
by
the
court
trying
the
case.
now
the
statute
prior
to
1887,
the
defendant
was
incompetent
to
testify
in
his
own
behalf
in
the
state
of
tennessee
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
your
honor,
there
is
a
case
that
is
cited
in
the
brief
which
i
believe
is
clemens
versus
state
which
held
that
he
could
testify
in
rebuttal.
this
statute
enacted
in
1887
in
conjunction
with
40-2402
is
my
contention
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute
of
the
legislators
at
that
time
was
that
40-2403
was
to
be
a
safety
vow.
because
of
this
with
a
new
concept
in
the
--
i
have
cited
in
brief
ferguson
versus
georgia
in
which
mr.
justice
brennan
cites
to
history
in
history
of
the
right
of
a
defendant
to
testify
and
that
this
was
a
new
concept
in
1887.
this
had
just
been
recent
enacted
in
several
states
for
granting
to
defense
the
right
to
testify.
in
tennessee,
it
is
my
opinion
that
the
reason
this
was
enacted
was
as
a
safety
vow
because
it
was
a
fear
and
it's
cited
by
whitmore
(ph)
in
the
brief
and
the
state
relies
on
it
considerably
in
their
brief
that
it
was
that
--
this
would
incur
perjury
that
it
would
give
a
defendant
the
opportunity
and
they
would
be
afraid
that
he
would
color
his
testimony
having
the
right
to
sit
there
as
a
witness
after
witness
standing
hearing
his
own
witnesses
testify
and
then
mold
or
adopt
his
testimony.
now
this
was
the
-
actually
it
was
raised
and
the
tennessee
adopted
the
statute
in
1887.
it
is
our
contentions
that
this
cite
in
the
brief
that
under
the
constitutional
grounds
that
this
fear
of
the
legislature
is
not
sufficient
that
the
constitutional
violation
is
in
the
fifth,
fourteenth
and
sixth
amendments
of
united
states
constitution
article
1,
section
9
overcome
this
and
make
it
imperative
that
we
ask
the
court
to
reverse
this
conviction
and
declare
this
statute
unconstitutional.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
justice
stewart
the
tennessee
and
kentucky
are
the
only
two
states
and
these
are
some
of
the
reasons
that
i
would
like
to
urge
the
point
while
i
am
urging
that
this
decision
be
declared
unconstitutional.
tennessee
and
kentucky
are
the
only
two
states
at
my
research
have
been
able
to
find
and
the
state
agrees
to
have
this
type
of
statute.
now
there
is
of
course
there
is
no
federal
rule
and
this
federal
rule
that
requires
this
and
18
u.s.c.a.
3481
allows
the
defendant
to
testify.
that's
the
federal
statute
granting
him
to
accomplish
and
to
testify,
there
is
nothing
that
states
when
he
must
testify.
this
is
not
the
rule
in
several
cases
in
tennessee.
a
plaintiff
does
not
have
to
be
the
first
witness.
a
defendant,
there
is
no
such
rule
as
this
is
requiring
order
to
testimony
in
a
civil
case
--
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
your
honor
in
the
--
there
is
one
decision,
the
u.s.
versus
shipp
which
is
359
federal
second
185
has
held
that
it
is
--
held
that
it
was
a
matter
of
discretion
within
the
court
as
to
allow
that
was
not
abuse
of
discretion
to
allow
the
trial
court
to
control
the
order
of
testimony.
that
is
cited
the
state
relies
upon
that
case
very
heavily.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
yes,
sir.
i
would
like
to
refer
to
that
just
for
a
moment,
i
believe
there
is
distinction.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
your
honor,
we
respectfully
feel
that
we
should
be
entitled
to
a
new
trial.
i
also
like
to
point
out
that
and
it's
not
cited
in
the
brief
and
i
ask
the
court
because
that's
only
reason
that
come
to
my
attention
that
a
special
committee
of
the
tennessee
legislature
pointed
by
the
governor
has
made
direct.
in
tennessee
we
are
presently
studying
to
revise
our
criminal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
to
completely
revamp
the
rules
in
tennessee.
that
a
special
committee
appointed
by
the
governor
and
the
legislature
has
recommended
that
this
statute
be
repealed
in
the
state
of
tennessee
which
gives
the
right
3003
as
the
second
if
even
a
--
either
a
defendant
or
the
state
request
it,
the
judge
may
exclude
from
the
hearing
of
trial
any
witnesses
of
the
first
party
not
the
time
under
examination
so
he
may
not
hear
the
testimony
of
other
witnesses.
this
provision
shall
not
apply
to
the
defendant,
the
attorneys
in
the
case
or
the
first
witness
for
the
state.
and
in
the
comment
that
it
says
the
purpose
of
this
section
is
to
replace
the
current
t.c.a.
40-2403
which
forces
the
defendant
to
testify
first
with
defense
if
he
intends
to
testify
at
all.
it
is
felt
that
defendant
should
be
allowed
to
testify
anytime
if
he
wishes
and
do
not
lose
the
right
to
be
heard
merely
because
he
does
not
testify
first.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
there
is
no
statute
which
requires
that
but
there
is
appellant
there
as
a
case
law
to
that
effect.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
they
speak
-
then
with
the
statute
this
was
also
discussed
under
this
amendment
also
mr.
justice
and
it
held
that
the
proposed
section
which
i
read
would
in
fact
allow
the
state
to
choose
a
witness
that
it
wanted
to
help
with
the
case.
the
state
would
merely
put
its
most
helpful
witness
on
the
stand
first,
that
is
what
they
proposed
under
the
statute.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
your
honor
under
the
coding
of
the
smartt
case
that
this
is
-
they
would
not
be
allowed
to
use
that
witness.
that
is
the
only
as
i
understand.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
sir?
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
yes,
sir.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
i
think
that
yes
sir
that
normally
this
case
that
cited
this
was
the
smartt
decision
which
is
derived
upon
in
the
governments
and
the
states'
brief
is
a
very
old
case
also
as
all
of
these
cases
relying
upon
this
argument.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
yes,
sir.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
yes,
your
honor.
it's
very
often
they
will
use
a
police
officer
who
handle
the
detective
who
handles
the
case
and
he
will
be
designated
as
the
prosecutor
and
he
sits
there
at
the
witness
stand.
i'm
not
saying
that
this
question
that
you
have
brought
up
is
not
very
often
raised,
in
fact
many
times
that
prosecutor
will
not
testify
or
it's
not
a
statutory
requirement.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
no,
your
honor,
i
moved
--
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
yes,
i
did
later
on.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
yes
sir,
i
did.
i
called
two
witnesses
your
honor.
one
of
the
detective
who
is
prosecuting
witness
in
this
matter
who
had
i
think
in
an
original
assignment
there
as
i
raised
a
confession
question
and
a
lineup
question
which
you
do
not
grant
certiorari
on.
but
the
detective
who
had
conducted
the
lineup
which
this
young
man
was
picked
out.
he
was
not
called
by
the
state
as
a
witness.
now
i
called
him
as
a
witness
for
the
--
they
relied
merely
upon
the
identification
of
the
victim.
i
called
the
detective
who
conducted
the
lineup
as
my
own
witness.
i
further
called
an
inmate
in
the
jail
who
had
been
--
was
in
the
same
lineup.
i
called
those
two
witnesses
that
i
put
on.
now,
the
court
may
want
--
did
i
renew
my
motion
after
they
had
testified.
i
did
not
do
that
and
i
felt
like
the
courts
ruling
in
itself.
i
have
certainly
felt
like
that
it
would
been
improper
for
me
to
do
so.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
no,
sir.
they
did
not
put
on
any
in
rebuttal
after
i
put
on
my
few
witnesses.
i
felt
i
had
raised
this
question
and
two
or
three
other
cases
and
fortunately
i
got
acquittals
then
and
i
had
one
time
i
had
done
this
before
the
presence
of
the
jury,
i
called
my
move
to
call
him
and
then
of
course
the
court
said
no,
you
cannot
put
them
on
and
i
thought
that
i
did
not
do
in
this
case
because
i
thought
it
might
been
improper
because
you
got
it
before
the
jury
the
fact
that
why
can't,
why
can't
the
defendant
testify
and
so
i
did
not
do
it.
i
thought
it
would
be
improper.
i
did
one
time
and
i
thought
it
might
have
been
improper
that's
why
your
honor.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
yes,
your
honor.
this
is
very,
very
simply.
it
is
this,
the
prejudice
involves
that
as
you
all
know
and
it's
cited
in
williams
versus
florida
in
justice
black's
opinion
with
justice
black's
opinion.
a
lawsuit
is
not
--
you
can
no
matter
how
hard
you
compare
your
lawsuit,
no
matter
how
well
you
know
your
witnesses
know
him
that's
how
well
you
have
talked
to
the
government's
witnesses
or
the
states
witnesses.
a
lawsuit
can
change
and
it's
our
contention
that
my
client
to
--
that
my
theory
is
this.
that
to
make
me
choose
at
the
beginning
of
the
trial,
i
did
not
feel
that
they
got
state
and
made
out
our
sufficient
case
in
which
i
should
have
to
put
my
client
on
the
stand.
my
client
had
no
criminal
records
stipulated
in
there.
it
was
not
--
i
was
trying
to
keep
him
off
the
stand
because
he
got
along
with
the
criminal
record
which
is
normally
the
case.
but
i
have,
i
did
not
feel
that
they
could
--
that
i
should
have
to
put
him
on
but
the
prejudice
involved
is
that
if
doing
the
course
of
--
i
wanted
to
put
on
other
two
witnesses
which
would
have
my
side.
the
quest
--
the
problem
is
that
if
i
put
this
witnesses
on
and
something
happens
that
they're
--
the
state
in
some
way
affects
their
testimony
and
something
comes
out
which
can
only
be
explained
by
the
defendant
taking
the
stand
then
i
or
on
by
way
of
witness
stand
i
am
precluded
for
putting
under
tennessee
procedure.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
your
honor,
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
prejudice
in
this
particular
case
there
came
up
after
the
court
have
ruled
that
i
cannot
put
him
on
and
then
it
give
up.
i
cannot
--
the
prejudice
came
up
of
course
not
answering
because
of
the
fact
that
i
cannot
pretty
understand.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
no,
sir.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
well,
in
regard
to
the
way
that
they
win,
i
put
on
the
detective,
i
put
on
the
detective.
i
called
him
as
my
witness.
the
court
in
tennessee
would
not
--
the
trial
judge
would
not
to
declare
him
as
a
witness
and
i
put
to
him
on
this
question
as
to
the
fact
that
this
was
a
very
highly
suggestive
lineup
in
which
this
young
man
had
been
arrested
for
other
charges,
his
picture
has
been
on
tv
and
this
detective
made
the
statement
that
when
he
called
this
prosecution
witness
to
come
down
here.
come
on
down
here,
we
got
the
boy
that
held
up
the
store
and
my
client
indicate
that
he
was
present
when
that
took
place.
this
came
out
on
putting
on
this
states
witness
who
i
had
to
call
myself
because
they
did
not
put
him
on.
therefore
this
situation
can
only
if-the
rebuttal
of
this
could
only
have
been
by
my
particular
client.
and
my
client,
i
could
not
rebut
this,
the
statement
that
when
the
--
when
i
put
the
detective
on
in
question
about
the
lineup
and
he
denied
this
it
could
only
be
rebutted
by
my
client
and
my
client
could
not
take
the
stand.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
no,
your
honor,
i
did
not.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
yes,
sir.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
yes,
sir.
i
think
it
certainly
would
have
it
at
that
time.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
no
sir
because
i
--
well
i
have
to
put
him
on
--
i
put
him
on
as
my
own
witness
and
of
course
i
have
made
it
in
the
situation
why
i
would
be
cross
examining
my
own
witness,
but
i
would
at
least
make
an
attempt
to
put
him
on
under
the
statute,
i
can
even
attempt
to
put
him
on.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
no
sir,
not
under
the
state
of
tennessee
procedure,
i
could
not.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
well,
your
honor
the
--
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
yes,
it
was.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
yes,
sir.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
yes,
sir.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
yes
it
was,
it
was
not
guilty
plea
and
he
was
tried
by
jury
and
the
jury
convicted
him.
as
i
stated,
they
urged
various
little
case
law
on
this
proposition.
the
case
is
-
it's
a
very
new
situation
where
that
the
abstaining
case
on
fully
petitioner
is
bell
versus
mississippi
which
is
an
1895
case
in
which
this
was
held
that
--
this
did
not
rely
on
the
statute
but
it
held
that
it
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
and
improper
for
the
trial
court
to
require
that
defendant
to
be
the
first
witness.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
yes
sir,
it
is.
and
also
the
67
decision
of
nassif
versus
dc
which
cites
the
bell
case
and
the
bell
case
is
being
authority
and
very
link
the
opinion
which
states
in
effect
that
it
was
still
good
law,
it
was
a
proper
rule
in
1885
by
the
mississippi
court
and
the
dc
court
followed
it
in
1967.
now,
we
also
--
we
take
the
position
that
the
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
of
this
statute
is
unconstitutional
and
it
denies
the
defendant
the
right
to
testify
in
a
criminal
case.
the
--
we
submit
that
under
this
--
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
well,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
our
contention
is
that
we
have
alleged
into
this
matter
that
under
the
sixth
amendment
we
are
contending
is
that
--
it
is
been
held
by
the
court
that
he
is
entitled
to
the
guiding
hand
of
the
counsel.
now
as
stated
by
mr.
blackmun
in
the
william
versus
florida
case
which
stated
very
briefly
that
the
law
changes
quite
frequently,
the
--
in
the
trial
of
lawsuit
which
he
said
that
any
lawyer
who
has
actually
tried
the
case
knows
that
regardless
of
demand
of
pretrial
preparation,
the
case
looks
far
different
when
it
is
actually
being
tried
and
when
it
is
only
been
thought
about.
we
say
that
this
statute,
how
the
prejudice
comes
back
is
that
if
the
pressure
--
the
burden
that
it
puts
upon
the
defendant
and
has
counsel
--
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
the
statute.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
the
statute.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
the
statute
precludes,
that
is
the
--
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
your
honor,
in
the
brief
the
tennessee
decision
discusses
the
question
of
rebuttal.
the
--
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
may
i
have
this
one
moment
your
honor
and
think
that
i
can
--
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
your
honor,
in
the
case
of
arnold
versus
state
it
was
cited
in
the
brief
that
the
case
where
the
defendant
was
convicted
of
assault
with
intent
to
commit
murder
in
the
second
degree
and
this
case,
the
defendant
did
not
testify
in
the
defense
proof.
now
he
attempted
the
call
as
a
rebuttal
of
witness
which
his
client
-
it
seems
incidentally
be
called
as
rebuttal
witness
to
deny
that
the
defendant
and
his
attorney
had
offered
the
victim
$500.00
to
drop
the
case
as
the
fact.
now
the
supreme
court
in
that
case
declined
to
allow
the
defendant
to
testify
an
objection
by
the
state
and
of
course
in
our
state
the
supreme
court
held
that
it
was
error
for
the
defendant
not
to
be
able
to
be
called
as
a
rebuttal
witness.
so
as
to
the
question,
he
could.
i
may
misinformed
the
court
that
he
could
been
called
as
a
rebuttal
witness
but
the
situation
in
--
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
the
rebutting
the
states
proof
yes
sir.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
yes
sir,
they
would.
i
am
sure
that
they
would
have
--
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
yes.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
no
sir
i
was
not.
in
fact
i
asked
the
court
--
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
correct,
yes
sir.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
yes,
sir.
i
realize
that
and
we
in
this
matter
your
honor,
this
court
has
under
the
fifth
amendment
has
held
that
the
defendant
has
predicted
under
griffin
versus
california
that
the
defendant
has
a
constitutional
right
to
remain
silent.
now,
and
that
goes
that
case
was
dealing
with
comment
on
the
failure
to
testify.
we
respectfully
submit
that
this
procedure
that
we
have
in
the
state
of
tennessee
is
so
far
it
is
in
the
minority,
it
is
not
been
adopted
by
any
except
in
the
state
of
kentucky,
has
not
been
adopted
by
the
federal
rules,
it's
not
the
rule
in
civil
cases
as
i
respect
would
submit
that
the
real
issue
is
this.
in
this
case
is
whether
the
constitution
implies
or
states
that
the
defendant
has
the
right
to
be
heard
in
any
case.
we
respectfully
like
to
save
our
time
for
rebuttal
in
respect
to
--
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
your
honor,
this
particular
matter
has
been
brought
up.
i
brought
it
up
three
times
prior
to
this
case
and
i
was
fortunate
in
any
cases.
i
brought
it
up
last
friday
in
the
case
and
the
state
offered
to
waive
it
again.
the
court
would
not
allow
him
to
wait.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
yes
and
they
have
taken
the
position
now
that
they
were
not
allowed
to
waive.
now
this
has
been
the
position
of
our
trial
judge
there
in
chattanooga
at
the
times
that
i
have
tried
to
waive
this.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
i
feel
that
it
is
more
a
matter
of
procedure
your
honor
but
it
has
not
been
raised.
this
is
to
consider
a
statute
been
on
books
for
this
period
of
time
as
very
few
cases
has
been
raised.
now,
we
have
one
late
decision
which
came
out
of
chattanooga
and
another
attorney
raised
his
proposition
and
at
the
harvey
case
but
it
was
--
based
its
ruling
just
on
the
clemens
case
which
is
old
decision.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
yes,
your
honor
the
--
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
yes,
your
honor,
this
is
--
this
by
an
oversight
that
this
matter
when
it
came
up,
it
was
on
the
fifth,
the
fourteenth
and
sixth
amendment.
however,
there
is
a
provision
and
also
article
1,
section
9
of
the
tennessee
constitution
which
if
i
may
have
read
the
--
which
i
think
it's
similar
to
the
sixth
amendment
in
certain
respects,
the
right
of
the
accused
in
criminal
prosecution
on
page
three
of
the
brief
and
all
criminal
prosecutions,
the
accused
had
the
right
to
be
heard
by
himself
and
his
counsel
and
to
defend
the
nature
and
cause
of
accusation
against
him.
it
pertains
to
speedy
trials
and
should
not
be
compelled
to
give
evidence
against
himself.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
your
honor,
i
think
that
probably
it
should,
i
have
--
we
have
primarily
relying
on
the
fifth
and
the
fourteenth
amendments.
i
put
the
sixth
in
but
i
think
the
court
is
probably
correct
that
we
should
not
be
allowed
to
consider
it
but
i
think
because
of
the
similarity,
i
did
argue
the
sixth
in
this
matter.
thank
you.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
a
very
short
time
i
have
remaining,
i
would
like
to
elaborate
on
some
questions
that
was
asked
by
justices
yesterday.
the
first
one
that
pertain
to
question
by
the
chief
--mr.
chief
justice
in
regard
the
question
of
offer
of
proof.
your
honor,
yesterday
you
inquired
as
to
whether
i
should
have
made
an
offer
proof
and
in
this
matter
which
you
felt
would
possibly
affect
the
record
more
fully.
i
would
only
say
that
in
the
law
in
the
state
of
tennessee
is
that
if
an
entire
land
of
testimony
is
excluded
or
an
entire
witnesses’
testimony
is
excluded
then
it
is
not
necessary
to
make
an
offer
of
proof
under
our
laws
of
the
state
of
tennessee
to
protect
an
appeal.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
is
it
permitted?
yes,
sir.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
well,
it
should
be
within
discretion
of
the
courts.
there
has
been
a
recent
decision
in
the
criminal
court
which
allows
you
to
make
a
--
in
the
criminal
courts
they’ve
allowed
you
to
make
an
offer
of
proof.
but
that
was
--
decision
came
after
this
case
was
tried.
in
regards
to
mr.
rehn
--
mr.
justice
rehnquist’s
question
yesterday,
i
believe
that
in
discussion
at
the
time
for
rebuttal
and
surrebutal
got
jumbled
up
and
i
would
like
to
say
that
it
is
my
contention
under
the
law
that
the
scope
that
the
defendant,
if
he
was
not
allowed
to
testify
and
put
on
other
witnesses,
the
state
then
put
on
rebuttal
witnesses
to
testify
to
rebut
his
witnesses
that
he
could
testify
as
surrebutal
witnesses
but
the
scope
of
his
surrebutal
would
be
limited
to
those
matters
which
had
been
brought
out
on
the
states
rebuttal.
now,
we
say
that
that
does
not
alleviate
the
problem
created
by
the
statute.
if
he
could
be
a
surrebutal
witness
because
there
are
matters
which
certainly
we
would
like
to
--
should
be
submitted
to
the
court.
now,
in
this
matter
in
regards
to
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
question
as
to
privilege
as
to
yesterday,
if
this
court
should
declare
the
statute
unconstitutional,
it
would
be
the
burden
upon
the
state
to
show
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
under
the
far
holdings
of
this
court
that
the
area
was
promised
and
not
prejudicial.
now,
our
position
is
that
we
contend
that
nothing
can
be
more
prejudicial
than
a
statute
which
will
restrict
or
deny
a
defendant
from
testifying
his
own
behalf
and
if
this
statute
is
per
se
prejudicial.
we
say
that
the
defendant
has
a
right
to
testify
under
the
authority
of
a
--
absolute
right
under
ferguson
versus
georgia
and
in
closing
i
would
respectfully
say
that
we
think
that
--
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
i
think
--
i
read
it
by
implication
that
that
was
the
way
that
i
read
the
decision
this
--
that
--
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
yes
sir,
yes
it
was.
but
i
felt
the
reading
--
hat
was
the
interpretation
that
applying
ferguson
to
this
case
that
donald
brooks
has
an
absolute
right
to
testify
in
a
criminal
case
and
that
it
--
that
any
that
the
state
--
the
statute
state
of
tennessee
is
restricting
that
right
and
that
is
the
argument.
in
closing,
i
would
say
that
the
decisions
of
bell
versus
mississippi
and
of
shipp
which
have
been
cited
which
the
dissenting
opinion
of
judge
mcalister
we
think
present
a
logical
and
analytical
approach
to
this
to
the
problem,
we
respectfully
urge
the
court
to
reverse
the
conviction
and
declare
the
statute
unconstitutional.
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
no,
you
do
not
your
honor.
i
respectfully
say
that
the
burden
--
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
your
honor,
i
would
say
no
because
they
urge
the
presumption
of
innocence
in
the
burden
of
proof
to
prove
guilt
is
upon
the
state
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jerry
h.
summers
your
honor,
being
in
the
heat
of
battle
in
many
trials
i
would
say
and
knowing
how
your
trial
can
change,
i
would
be
reluctant
as
the
trial
counsel
to
--
until
i
had
heard
some
of
the
proof.
i
make
the
decision
quite
frequently
as
to
whether
my
--
to
put
my
client
on
the
stand
by
the
manner
in
which
the
states
approve
and
i
say
would
be
first
--
it
would
be
a
very
infrequent
case
which
i
would
put
my
client
on
because
we
do
not
have
full
discovery
in
the
state
of
tennessee,
we
have
very
limited
in
criminal
procedure
and
i
would
be
very
hesitant
to
put
my
client
on
the
stand
to
--
since
to
kill
the
prosecution
there
might
be
a
very
rare
case
in
which
it
might
be
such
as
a
matter
of
incest
in
which
you
–-
it
would
be
uncorroborated
testimony
of
an
accomplice
and
with
the
state
had
very
limited
--
a
very
weak
case.
but
i
would
be
very
reluctant
as
to
file
counsel
to
employ
such
a
tactic
because
i
can
foresee
it
could
backfire
very
readily.
