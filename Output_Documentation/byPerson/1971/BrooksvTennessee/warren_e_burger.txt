mr.
summers
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
summers,
maybe
you
can
clear
up
the
confusion
for
me.
in
this
case
when
the
prosecution
rested,
do
you
put
on
some
evidence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
none
whatever?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
your
first
argue,
i'm
aware
that
you
made
the
motion,
then
you
put
on
some
evidence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
the
state
put
on
any
additional
evidence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
you
at
that
point
or
at
any
point
in
the
trial
than
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury
make
it
proper
of
which
your
client
would
testify
to
if
he
had
been
permitted
to
take
the
stand
in
the
order
that
you
requested?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
don't
you
think
that
would
have
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
help
someone?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh!
but
in
this
case,
what
prevented
you
from
putting
him
on
after
the
officer
testified,
someone
has
asked
you
that
before
but
i
am
not
clear.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
could
not
put
them
on
after
the
notion.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judges,
you
sense
before
that
they
have
modified
this
with
respect
to
rebuttal
and
answer
to
an
early
question
of
justice
blackmun.
you
said
that
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
has
permitted
and
we
put
on
other
border
or
rebuttal
testimony
only.
now
that
would
be
to
rebut
this
certain
rebuttal
is
rather
could
really
be,
wouldn't
it?
that
would
come
only
after
the
stated
put
on
some
new
evidence
following
your
defense
and
then
you
can
put
your
man
on,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
i
correctly
understand
you
to
say
that
in
response
to
justice
blackmun's
question
that
he
can
be
put
on
in
rebuttal?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
[voice
overlap]
go
ahead.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
this
generally
regarded
as
a
rule
or
procedure?
how
do
you
--
how
is
it
regarded?
currently
this
judge
treats
this
matter
of
substantive
along
some
way?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
summaries
one
last
technical
question.
are
you
arguing
the
sixth
amendment
here
as
well
as
the
fifth?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
my
secondarily,
are
you
foreclosed
and
more
limited
grant
of
cert?
wasn't
our
grant
of
cert
here
limited?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
know
what
you're
arguing.
my
question
was
whether
a
limited
grant
of
cert
restricted
you
the
fifth?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
kendrick,
we
have
only
three
minutes
left
if
you
would
prefer
not
to
split
your
argument
so
we'll
defer
it
in
the
morning.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
take
you
up
first
thing
in
the
morning.
chief
justice

e.
burger
argument
now
in
number
71-5313,
brooks
against
tennessee.
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
this
in
your
own
brief
now,
13
and
14?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
is
up
but
if
you
--
you
may
draw
into
a
conclusion
which
you
can
go
on.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
it
briefly.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
kendrick.
mr.
summers.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
permitted?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
make
an
offer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
summers
just
one
question.
you
just
said
made
claim
to
an
absolute
constitutional
right
to
testify
on
behalf
of
the
defendant.
suppose
the
defendant
at
the
opening
of
a
case
after
the
jury
was
selected,
defendant’s
counsel
said
now
before
the
minds
of
the
jury
are
poisoned,
influenced
by
the
prosecutions
testimony,
i
would
like
an
opportunity
to
put
my
defendants,
the
accused
on
the
stand
and
have
him
tell
his
story
to
this
jury.
would
you
think
he
would
an
absolute
right
as
part
of
his
absolute
right
to
testify
that
you
claim
to
be
heard
first
before
the
state
is
heard
from?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
concede
that
that
might
be
a
very
helpful
thing
to
a
defendant
sometimes
to
be
able
to
get
to
the
jury
first
before
they
have
heard
the
prosecutions
witnesses?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
acknowledged
the
tactical
matter.
you
suggest
that
it
would
never
be
to
the
advantage
of
the
defendant
to
have
that
opportunity
to
reach
the
jury
with
his
story
first?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
summers.
