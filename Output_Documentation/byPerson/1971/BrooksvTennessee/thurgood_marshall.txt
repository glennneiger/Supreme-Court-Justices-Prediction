justice
thurgood
marshall
could
it
be
that
the
constitution
required
that
defendant
be
in
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
it
doesn’t
require
to
prosecuting
witness
being
in
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what’s
the
rule
in
tennessee
if
a
witness
to
the
group
that’s
sequestered
testifies
and
then
hears
four
or
five
other
witnesses
and
then
is
asked
to
re-testify,
is
that
discretionary
with
the
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
was
not
discretionary
here
because
in
this
case,
the
man
has
and
he
was
denied
that
right
because
of
the
statute.
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
he
hasn’t
testified?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
case
is
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what
did
it
do
with
the
statute?
did
the
stat
--
did
the
court
ignored
the
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
wasn’t
relaxed
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
was
not
relaxed
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no.
he
did
not
want
to
go
on
first.
justice
thurgood
marshall
[laughter]
what
i
mean,
the
supreme
court
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
upheld
that.
that’s
for
his
faith
to
go
on
first
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
precluded
him
from
testifying
any
time?
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
whole
point
is
that
all
these
other
decisions
do
not
help
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
does
--
the
other
cases
of
relaxation
help
this
claim?
not
at
all,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
kendrick,
you
can
say
it
was
an
inconvenience
to
the
state
in
this
case,
was
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
might
remind
you
that
the
state
offered
to
waive
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
he
did
it,
you
don’t
contest
that
he
did
say
it
was
all
right
with
him.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
a
number
of
other
question
is,
when
was
the
sequestration
rule
adopted
in
tennessee?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
keep
saying
that
this
is
tied
in
it.
nothing
can
be
find
anything
in
the
statute
that
even
hints
that
it’s
tied
in
to
the
sequestration
rule.
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
it
was
that
the
state
of
tennessee
in
granting
the
defendant
the
right
to
testify
put
this
limitation
on.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
where
do
we
get
this
and
the
reason
for
it
was
the
reason
that
the
prosecuting
witness
had
to
go
first?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
the
prime
side,
isn’t
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don’t
think
it’s
a
matter
of
due
process
that
the
person
entitled
to
control
his
witnesses
as
to
when
he
puts
on
his
proof
and
how
he
it
puts
it
on.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
would
your
case
be
different
if
the
statute
had
said
that
all
witnesses
who
are
going
to
testify
must
testify
first?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
said
the
prosecuting
witness
has
to
go
first?
justice
thurgood
marshall
statute
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
you
equate
the
prosecuting
witness
with
the
defendant
and
i
suggest
that
that’s
improper.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
suggest
that
the
prosecuting
witness
and
the
defendant
are
not
at
equal
positions.
as
i
understand
that
this
is
the
donald
l.
brooks
versus
the
state
of
tennessee.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don’t
even
know
who
the
prosecuting
witness
was?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
state
is
the
party.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
happens
if
the
defendant
waived
the
rule?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
the
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
can’t
you
reply?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
statute
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
do
you
meet
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
in
tennessee
you
can
get
depositions
with
the
government’s
witnesses?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i’m
talking
about
criminal
cases.
