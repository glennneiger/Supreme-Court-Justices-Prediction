mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
if
it
please
the
court
i
would
defer
it
in
the
morning.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it’s
a
privilege
for
me
to
represent
the
state
of
tennessee
here
today
in
an
effort
to
maintain
a
statute
that
our
elected
representatives
enacted
some
85
years
ago
and
have
maintained
until
this
day.
this
statute
is
well
known
to
tennessee
lawyers
and
judges
and
has
been
routinely
applied
and
seldom
questioned.
i
believe
i’m
correct
in
saying
that
its
constitutionality
has
not
been
challenged
in
the
appellate
courts
to
the
state
of
tennessee
or
in
the
united
states
courts
until
this
case
and
until
the
case
of
harvey
versus
state
which
our
supreme
court
decided
last
year
sustaining
the
statute.
it
is
not
in
the
record
and
i
have
not
known
until
mr.
summers
brought
forward
yesterday
that
some
man
--
member
committee
has
recommended,
not
a
committee
of
the
legislature,
has
recommended
that
the
tennessee
legislature
both
qualify
the
sequestration
of
witnesses
rule
which
is
now
a
rule
of
court
or
by
decision
and
also
repeal
or
mend
the
statute
which
is
before
the
court
today.
to
my
knowledge
no
bill
has
been
introduced
to
do
that
but
if
the
--
but
the
legislature,
the
legislative
branch
created
this
statutory
rule
and
its
--
it
is
its
prerogative
to
change
it
or
to
remove
it
or
to
retain
it
if
it
wishes
and
i
don’t
see
that
that
particular
relevant
here
today.
i’d
like
to
remind
the
court
of
something
that
justice
cardozo
said
a
number
of
years
ago
which
we
believed
to
be
at
the
a
pro
po
here.
he
said
to
the
court
in
snyder
versus
commonwealth
of
massachusetts,
not
cited
in
our
brief
but
at
page
or
volume
291
u.s.
97
at
page
105.
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
is
free
to
regulate
procedure
of
its
courts
and
a
court
with
its
own
conception
of
policy
and
fairness.
unless
in
so
doing
it
offends
some
principle
of
justice
so
rooted
in
the
tradition
and
conscience
of
our
people
as
to
be
ranked
as
fundamental.
and
further
at
page
122,
“but
justice,
though
due
to
the
accused,
is
due
to
the
accuser
also.
the
concept
of
fairness
must
not
be
strained
till
it
is
narrowed
to
a
filament.
we
ought
to
keep
the
balance
true.”
justice
therefore
is
due
to
the
accuser,
to
the
victim
of
a
crime,
to
the
people
of
the
state
and
we
ask
the
court
today
in
the
words
of
justice
cardozo
to
keep
the
balance
true.
the
balance
is
all
ready
weighted
in
favor
of
the
defendant
in
a
number
of
well-known
ways
to
the
court
and
i
shall
not
go
into
those.
i
will
refer
to
one
of
them
of
which
is
pertinent
here
that
is
that
if
the
defendant
testifies,
unlike
all
other
witnesses,
he
may
not
be
compelled
to
be
outside
the
courtroom
while
other
testimony
is
being
given.
the
petitioner
here
would
like
to
be
favored
even
further.
he
would
like
uniquely
among
all
the
witnesses
to
be
able
after
sitting
in
the
courtroom
and
hearing
the
testimony
of
his
own
witnesses
to
be
able
to
follow
him
to
the
stand
and
to
testify
in
conformity
to
what
they’ve
stated.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
well
it’s
not
unique.
it
is
done
in
48
states
but
a
--
unique
among
the
witnesses,
he
is
the
only
one
who
can
do
that.
and
he
would
like
to
be
able
to
do
that
in
tennessee.
but
to
proceed
under
the
sequestration
of
witnesses
rule,
none
of
the
state’s
witnesses
has
that
privilege
or
is
favored
as
this
petitioner
seeks
to
be
in
tennessee,
not
even
the
prosecuting
witness.
thus
a
citizen
may
be
assaulted
and
robbed
or
raped
and
as
the
prosecuting
witness,
he
or
she
may
not
under
the
sequestration
rule
remain
in
the
courtroom
and
hear
the
other
witnesses
for
the
state
before
testifying.
now,
in
order
for
the
prosecuting
witness
to
be
in
the
test
--
in
the
courtroom
and
to
assist
the
district
attorney
general
in
putting
all
of
the
state’s
file
to
the
case,
the
prosecuting
witness
must
go
on
first.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
mr.
justice,
we
don’t
have
any
decisions
on
that
point
but
it’s
my
opinion
that
that
could
be
done.
while
it
may
not,
the
people
of
tennessee
through
their
duly
elected
representatives
enact
and
maintain
a
statute
which
requires
in
at
least
to
this
area
that
the
defense
be
subject
to
the
same
procedure
of
requirements
as
the
prosecution.
that
the
accused,
that
he
has
to
testify
like
the
prosecuting
witness
who
testifies
and
remains
in
the
courtroom
must
testify
first
for
his
side.
while
in
the
name
of
truth
and
justice
and
to
keep
the
balance
true,
many
of
the
people
of
the
state
not
require
that.
the
court
may
--
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
yes,
indeed
it
does
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
it
does
not
and
that’s
what
--
that’s
part
of
the
problem
of
course.
that
the
defendant
and
i
referred
that
a
moment
ago
that
the
defendant
has
the
right,
he
is
favored
in
that
way
and
we
are
not
contesting
it
to
be
on
the
courtroom.
but
under
the
sequestration
of
witnesses
rule,
the
prosecuting
witness
may
not
be
there
and
do
the
same
thing
and
hear
the
other
witnesses
for
his
side
and
then
testify.
if
he
is
to
test
--
to
be
there,
he
has
to
testify
first.
now
this
is
closely
connected
of
course
with
the
sequestration
of
witnesses
rule
and
all
we
submit
that
all
the
policy
arguments
and
statements
that
favor
the
sequestration
of
witnesses
rule
argued
in
favor
of
the
tennessee
statute.
to
make
the
sequestration
of
witnesses
rule
more
effective,
some
states
in
fact
this
object
the
parties
to
that
rule
in
several
cases.
and
a
number
of
courts
in
several
cases
have
required
the
parties
to
testify
first.
we
note
this
on
page
7
of
our
brief.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
it
stated
i
think
in
the
brief
for
the
petitioner
but
i
don’t
have
that
date
in
mind,
no
sir.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
i
think
perhaps
--
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
that’s
perhaps
is
right,
i
think
that’s
right.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
never,
never
been
changed
in
the
state,
never
to
my
knowledge
been
challenged
until
over
the
last
year
or
two
and
i
think,
and
that
definitely
go
even
further,
it
is
not
being
challenged
anywhere
except
in
the
city
of
chattanooga
and
balance,
summers
says,
has
got
in
here.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
yes,
sir
and
it
by
the
--
and
i’ll
get
to
this
in
a
moment.
mr.
summers
in
err
--
is
in
error
in
saying
only
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
has
sustained
such
a
rule
in
the
federal
district
court
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief.
the
ninth
circuit
has
also
sustained
that
procedure
in
the
federal
district
court.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
he
has
that
right
in
tennessee,
he
needs
--
has
it
by
the
statute,
i
don’t
think
that’s
really
an
issue.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
that
the
--
that
his
counsel
has
the
right
to
direct
a
statement
and
to
have
to
do
that
of
the
defendant
and
i
would
not
follow
that.
we
certainly
believe
the
defendant
ought
to
be
to
testify
in
his
own
behalf
and
our
statutes
provide
that.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
well,
it’s
simply
a
matter
of
procedure
to
hogan
which
these
witnesses
go
on.
farther
--
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
yes.
that’s
the
way
that
the
trial
court
viewed
it
and
the
statute
reads
somewhat
in
that
way
although
our
appellate
courts
have
been
some
what
liberal
in
the
interpretation
of
it
in
permitting
the
defendant
to
testify
on
rebuttal
even
when
he
hasn’t
testified
on
the
writ
or
in
the
main
part
of
the
case.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
that’s
martin
versus
state,
151
tennessee
383,
it’s
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
no,
sir,
the
--
it’s
been
relaxed
or
that
decision
to
the
extent
that
that
although
it
appears
to
read
in
mandatory
language,
the
parties
may
waive
it
or
the
--
and
the
defendant
is
permitted
to
testify
in
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
sir?
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
of
the
--
the
defendant
wanted
to
go
on
first
and
the
court
would
not
let
him
do
that,
that’s
right.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
i’m
sorry.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
that’s
a
slip,
he
did
not
want
to
go
on
first.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
the
supreme
court
--
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
the
supreme
court
denied
certiorari
and
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
sustained
the
decision
to
the
trial
court
that
the
statute
did
not
permit
him
to
go
on
at
a
later
time.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
they
were
not
--
i
don’t
know
whether
they
were
invoked
by
anyone.
they
weren’t
referred
to
and
it’s
true
that
the
defendant
was
not
able
to
go
on
out
of
order.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
he
did
not
get
what
he
wanted.
i
would
like
to
refer
the
court
to
the
fact
and
how
important
this
is,
i
don’t
know
that
this
is
not
unique
in
tennessee.
it’s
all
ready
been
alluded
to
that
the
state
of
kentucky
has
a
similar
statute
that’s
been
on
the
books
for
79
years
and
to
my
knowledge
has
not
been
challenged
the
question
as
to
its
constitutionality.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit,
five
of
the
six
judges
in
those
cases
that
heard
those
cases
approved
the
rule
in
the
federal
district
courts,
it
is
a
rule
--
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
sir?
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
it
came
up
from
the
western
--
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
yes.
and
then
the
three
judges
in
the
ninth
circuit
court
--
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
were
not
tennessee
lawyers.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
it
was
a
court
ruling,
there
was
no
federal
statute
involved.
the
district
court
judge
simply
--
well,
it’s
quoted
on
page
8
of
our
brief.
the
defendant
wanted
to
--
well,
the
court
said
that
if
the
defendant
was
going
to
testify
in
his
own
behalf,
he
have
to
proceed
all
the
other
witnesses
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
and
i
quote
just
a
little
bit
from
that
says
that,
“trial
court’s
ruling
seems
to
be
a
sensible
approach
to
the
problem
of
what
to
do
with
the
party
who
is
also
a
witness
when
the
exclusion
of
witnesses
is
called
for
in
order
to
prevent
fabrication
of
testimony
and
cites
wigmore
on
evidence
and
goes
on
to
say
that
there
is
no
prejudice
shown
and
the
only
connection
we
can
think
of
the
appellant
was
rendered
incapable
of
tailoring
his
own
testimony
to
fit
in
with
what
previously
was
said
by
other
witnesses.”
and
beside
the
american
jurisdictions
that
we’ve
referred
to,
a
number
of
english
speaking
jurisdictions
have
had
this
rule
and
still
have
it.
and
we
refer
in
--
on
pages
10
and
11
to
--
a
case
from
alberta,
canada
in
which
the
court
said
to
be
called
as
the
first
witness
for
the
defense
or
that
the
accuse
ought
to
be
called
as
the
first
witness
for
the
offense
because
otherwise
its
--
observation
to
the
jury
that
the
accused
has
called
it
or
adopted
his
evidence
that
fit
in
with
the
evidence
of
the
witnesses
who
proceeded
him.
and
we
refer
to
an
australian
case
upholding
the
rule
and
i
think
significantly
in
england,
a
rule
that’s
been
a
matter
of
practice
since
at
least
1911,
only
recently
in
1968
by
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
in
--
or
the
court
of
appeals
in
criminal
division
in
england
in
a
unanimous
decision
was
made
a
rule
of
court
for
england
and
the
justice
who
wrote
the
opinion
for
that
court
in
1968
said
in
part,
the
reason
for
this
is
obvious.
it’s
that
if
they
are
to
be
permitted
to
hear
the
evidence,
that
is
the
defendants
or
other
witnesses,
they
may
be
tempted
to
turn
their
own
evidence
and
we
get
and
i
will
get
to
this
a
bit
later
if
i
have
the
time.
this
shows
the
reason
of
a
rationality
of
the
rule
and
mr.
summers
saw
the
petitioner
contends
that
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
it’s
an
unreasonable
rule
and
we
contend
that
it’s
imminently
a
reasonable
rule
and
this
court
all
said
so
that
i
referred
to.
so
we
have
to
take
the
position
that
the
tennessee
rule
is
a
truth
in
testimonial
law,
a
truth
in
testimonial
law
that
it
promotes
truthful
testimony
that
it’s
a
rational,
a
logical,
a
legitimate
complement
of
the
sequestration
of
witnesses
rule.
now,
i
think
remarkably
if
the
court
would
look
at
the
pages
that
i’m
going
to
refer
you
to
now
in
the
petitioner’s
brief
that
there
is
a
concession
of
rationality
there.
so
at
page
9
of
the
petitioner’s
brief,
he
says
that
the
fact
that
a
party
may
not
be
placed
under
the
rule,
that
is
the
sequestration
rule,
was
probably
one
of
the
chief
reasons
for
the
requirement.
and
then
he
says
at
page
9
that
requiring
the
defendant
to
testify
first
if
he
testifies
at
all
ensures
that
he
will
not
be
tempted
to
alter
his
own
testimony
after
hearing
other
evidence
presented
in
his
behalf
and
the
petitioner
says
further
at
pages
7
and
8
that
the
occasional
readiness
of
the
interested
person
to
adopt
his
testimony
when
offered
later
to
a
victory
rather
than
to
a
veracity
so
as
to
meet
the
necessities
is
laid
opened
by
a
file
of
witnesses
is
a
rationale
basis
for
the
tennessee
statutes
in
question.
and
then
finally
at
page
17
of
the
petitioner’s
brief,
the
petitioner
says,
the
purpose
of
this
code
section
to
ensure
that
a
defendant
not
be
tempted
to
color
his
version
of
the
circumstances
by
hearing
witnesses
in
favor
prior
to
his
own
testimony
is
perhaps
legitimate.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
he
said
all
of
this
things
and
i
applaud
him
for
his
fairness,
true.
but
the
--
and
he
does
view
this
as
a
burden
and
the
state
will
say
that
that
sometimes
it
may
appear
to
be
an
inconvenience
to
the
defendant
but
it’s
an
inconvenience
to
the
state
to
have
the
limitation
that’s
placed
upon
it.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
no,
i
think
my
point
--
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
true
and
i
wasn’t
present
at
the
trial.
the
district
attorney
general
took
care
of
the
trial
and
this
--
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
true
and
i
can
only
speculate
that
it
really
probably
didn’t
make
any
difference
to
the
state
in
this
case
because
they
have
confessed
(voice
overlap).
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
all
might,
it’s
very
ancient.
i
think
it’s
been
in
effect
to
all
the
way
back
as
far
as
--
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
well,
the
statute
was
--
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
that’s
when
the
limitation
was
first
put
on.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
it
did
not
state
it
there
but
we
have
by
judicial
decision
the
requirement
of
the
prosecuting
witness
so
far.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
i
don’t
know
that
your
honor.
i
think
when
it
first
came
up
that
the
court
ruled
that
way.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
i
don’t
think
it’s
a
matter
of
due
process,
your
honor.
i
think
it’s
a
matter
and
in
fact
the
number
of
courts
in
the
--
that
court
rule
simply
as
a
procedure
for
regulating
the
order
in
that
testimony.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
i
don’t
understand
the
question.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
that’s
true
your
honor,
if
he’s
going
to
testify,
he
has
to
testify
first.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
and
i
think
it’s
proposed
in
this
committee
recommendation.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
sir?
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
it
is,
yes.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
no,
he
was
a
man
who
had
his
a
store.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
well
--
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
the
state
is
the
party.
that’s
true
but
i
don’t
think
it’s
correct
to
say
that
the
prosecuting
witness
has
no
interest
in
the
outcome,
well,
when
he’s
been
robbed
and
he
wants
to
see
justice
there
and
he
is
the
chief
witness
to
the
state.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
yes,
he
does.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
yes,
he
does.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
it’s
not
a
matter
of
law,
the
judge
routinely
says
that
parties
want
the
rule
and
rather
routine
as
they
say
we
do.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
yes.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
that
goes
in
there.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
the
sequestration
rule?
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
well,
if
the
--
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
if
the
state
--
both
parties
have
to
waive
the
rule
and
then
the
rule
is
not
in
effect.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
the
statute
still
is
in
effect,
that’s
right.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
i
don’t
know
that
we
have
to
meet
it.
the
judges
though
will
apply
the
statute
unless
it’s
waived
by
the
state
and
sometimes
the
state
offers
to
waive
it
in
and
then
the
defendant
may
go
on
when
he
wants
to,
agrees
to
waive.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
i
do
not
remember
that,
it
was
invoked.
and
we
refer
the
court
at
pages
13
and
14
to
the
decision
which
requires
this
to
the
prosecution
--
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
yes
sir,
i’m
sorry
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice,
pages
13
and
14
of
our
brief.
we
refer
to
the
judicial
requirement
that
the
prosecution
or
the
prosecuting
witness
go
on
first.
i
hope
we’ve
been
able
to
demonstrate
that
what
we
have
in
tennessee
here
then
is
not
a
unique
requirement
but
even
if
it
was
unique
requirement
that
would
make
it
unconstitutional.
under
our
federal
system
of
government
the
states
are
--
as
mr.
justice
brandeis
said
are
laboratories
in
which
experimentation
may
be
made
and
referred
to
an
opinion
by
justice
blackmun
in
mckeiver
versus
pennsylvania
on
page
15
of
our
brief
to
the
same
effect.
so,
we
submit
that
a
judge
should
not
vote
against
this
rule
of
procedure
simply
because
he
disagrees
with
it
as
a
matter
of
policy
or
i
would
personally
prefer
an
ultimate
procedure
and
we
refer
to
the
court
to
justice
harlan’s
opinion
in
mcgautha
versus
california
in
1971
decision
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
402
u.s.
183
and
221
and
we
refer
the
court
also
to
mr.
justice
stewart’s
concurring
opinion
in
spencer
versus
u.s.
also
cited
in
our
brief
--
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
against
texas,
385
u.s.
352
and
567,
thank
you
sir.
now
in
the
time
which
may
remains
me,
i’d
like
to
turn
to
the
petitioners
objections
to
the
tennessee
statute
and
i
understand
from
his
oral
argument
yesterday
that
he
does
conceive
that
the
sixth
amendment
question
is
not
before
the
court
in
view
of
the
limited
grant
of
certiorari.
his
fifth
amendment
argument
as
i
gather
is
that
this
rule
in
some
way
infringes
upon
the
defendant’s
right
to
remain
silent
and
by
the
way
rather
remarkably,
i
think
later
on
he
argues
under
the
tennessee
constitution
provision
that
it
also
infringes
his
right
to
be
heard
but
now
he
says
it
infringes
upon
his
right
to
silent.
but
at
page
16
of
his
brief
he
concedes,
“nor
does
it
deny
a
defendant
to
their
right
to
remain
silent.”
his
point
seems
to
be
that
because
he
has
to
go
on
first,
if
he
goes
on
at
all
that
this
is
cutting
down
on
his
privilege
or
chilling
it
in
some
way
and
that
it
makes
it
more
difficult.
the
states
answer
to
this
is,
that
petitioner
and
his
counsel
ought
to
know
before
they
get
to
trial.
but
the
testimony
will
be
what
the
witnesses
will
say
and
the
desirability
for
waiving
the
right
to
remain
silent
and
taking
the
stand
in
its
own
behalf.
our
feeling
about
is
that
the
only
thing
that
is
limited
as
far
as
the
defendant
is
concerned
is
the
opportunity
to
trim
or
to
color
or
to
falsify
his
testimony
to
conform
of
what
the
other
witnesses
on
his
side
have
said
and
this
is
what
this
case
is
uniformly
say
that
we
have
all
ready
referred
the
court
to.
the
defendant
says
that
in
choosing
to
testify
more
making
at
charge
at
the
beginning
of
his
proof.
he
then
hazards
himself
through
the
cross
examination
or
subjects
himself
to
the
hazards
of
cross
examination,
indeed
he
does.
but
every
witness
who
goes
on
the
stand
subjects
himself
to
that
hazard
and
the
defendant
will
be
subjected
to
that
hazard
regardless
of
when
he
takes
the
stand.
another
point
he
makes
is
that
choosing
to
testify
the
beginning
of
this
proof
is
a
matter
which
should
be
left
to
his
unfretted
freedom.
now,
we
point
out
at
pages
18
and
19
of
our
brief
that
the
defendant
has
the
unfretted
freedom
to
testify.
he
only
--
he
is
restricted
as
to
when
he
can
testify
and
we
cite
them
mcgautha
versus
california
to
the
effect
that
it’s
not
unconstitutional
simply
to
make
him
exercise
a
difficult
choice.
i
would
like
to
move
quickly
to
his
fourteenth
amendment
argument
which
our
view
is
in
three
parts.
one
is
that
it
imposes
a
burden
upon
him.
it
does
into
some
extent
limit
him
but
again,
i
remind
the
court
that
he’s
not
restricted
from
testifying.
he
may
testify.
the
court
though
will
require
him
to
testify
first.
but
there
is
no
reason
why
he
has
to
hear
the
testimony
of
his
own
witnesses
before
he
takes
the
stand.
a
lot
of
good
reasons
why
he
has
to
hear
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses
of
the
state
against
him
but
he
ought
to
know
before
his
own
witnesses
take
the
stand
what
they
are
going
to
say.
now,
if
they
crack
up
on
the
cross
examination
then
it
would
be
beneficial
to
him
to
be
able
to
get
back
on
the
stand
and
to
rehabilitate
the
case
i
suppose.
the
second
--
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
well,
he
has
opened
to
him
an
opportunity
before
taking
--
discover
deposition
in
advance
in
the
trial
and
know
--
and
to
know
under
oath
what
the
officer
is
going
to
say.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
that’s
my
remembrance
of
it
your
honor.
i
would
not
like
to
be
held
to
that
but
that
that’s
the
way
i
remember
it.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
that’s
certainly
true
in
civil
cases
and
--
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
i
know
you
are
and
i
just
have
to
say
i
don’t
have
a
clear
--
i
am
not
entirely
sure
of
that.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
all
right.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
but
he
may
go
out
--
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
if
all
those
things
are
done.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
and
what’s
the
question?
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
no.
you
don’t
know
where
you
stand
on
the
defense.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
i
don’t
remember
that
all
of
those
things
were
true
about
him
having
been
subpoenaed
--
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
yes,
that’s
right,
if
he
called
him,
he
would
have
been
the
witness
of
the
defendant
but
we
don’t
conceive
that
that
in
any
way
denies
this
defendant
of
his
fourteenth
amendment
or
due
process
rise
and
may
i
just
tell
--
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
you
certainly
should
be
able
to
interview
your
witnesses
in
advance
unless
you
make
the
spot
decision
after
you
get
to
court
that
you
are
going
to
call
some
witness
you
have
thought
of
calling
to
the
court
and
i
don’t
know
of
any
reason
why
this
defendant
in
this
case
did
not
have
interviewed
the
chief
or
anybody
else
that
he
wanted
to
out
of
a
trial.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
to
allow
him
to
be
recalled
to
the
stand
after
he
wants
to
testify
and
your
honor
may
i
--
i
have
seen
the
red
light.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
i
would
like
to
make
a
concluding
statement
if
it
please
the
court.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
the
only
other
point
that
i
haven’t
covered
and
i
will
cover
it
in
one
sentence,
concerns
the
matter
of
the
state
constitution.
it’s
contended
that
the
tennessee
courts
have
misconstrued
the
statute
in
holding
that
it
is
not
unconstitutional
on
its
state
constitution
and
i
would
like
to
refer
the
court
throughout
the
cases
that
we
cite
and
filed
proposition
of
our
brief
to
the
effect
that
that
is
decisions
of
this
court
that
that
is
really
a
matter
for
the
state
courts
to
decide
whether
state
statute
violate
the
state
constitution
and
it’s
not
a
federal
question
for
this
court
to
be
concerned
with.
in
conclusion,
i
would
simply
say
that
the
defendant
has
not
made
out
a
case
that
runs
constitutionality
of
this
truth
and
testimonial
law
and
we
do
ask
the
court
in
the
words
of
justice
cardozo
to
keep
the
balance
true.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
if
it
please
the
court
i
would
defer
it
in
the
morning.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it’s
a
privilege
for
me
to
represent
the
state
of
tennessee
here
today
in
an
effort
to
maintain
a
statute
that
our
elected
representatives
enacted
some
85
years
ago
and
have
maintained
until
this
day.
this
statute
is
well
known
to
tennessee
lawyers
and
judges
and
has
been
routinely
applied
and
seldom
questioned.
i
believe
i’m
correct
in
saying
that
its
constitutionality
has
not
been
challenged
in
the
appellate
courts
to
the
state
of
tennessee
or
in
the
united
states
courts
until
this
case
and
until
the
case
of
harvey
versus
state
which
our
supreme
court
decided
last
year
sustaining
the
statute.
it
is
not
in
the
record
and
i
have
not
known
until
mr.
summers
brought
forward
yesterday
that
some
man
--
member
committee
has
recommended,
not
a
committee
of
the
legislature,
has
recommended
that
the
tennessee
legislature
both
qualify
the
sequestration
of
witnesses
rule
which
is
now
a
rule
of
court
or
by
decision
and
also
repeal
or
mend
the
statute
which
is
before
the
court
today.
to
my
knowledge
no
bill
has
been
introduced
to
do
that
but
if
the
--
but
the
legislature,
the
legislative
branch
created
this
statutory
rule
and
its
--
it
is
its
prerogative
to
change
it
or
to
remove
it
or
to
retain
it
if
it
wishes
and
i
don’t
see
that
that
particular
relevant
here
today.
i’d
like
to
remind
the
court
of
something
that
justice
cardozo
said
a
number
of
years
ago
which
we
believed
to
be
at
the
a
pro
po
here.
he
said
to
the
court
in
snyder
versus
commonwealth
of
massachusetts,
not
cited
in
our
brief
but
at
page
or
volume
291
u.s.
97
at
page
105.
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
is
free
to
regulate
procedure
of
its
courts
and
a
court
with
its
own
conception
of
policy
and
fairness.
unless
in
so
doing
it
offends
some
principle
of
justice
so
rooted
in
the
tradition
and
conscience
of
our
people
as
to
be
ranked
as
fundamental.
and
further
at
page
122,
“but
justice,
though
due
to
the
accused,
is
due
to
the
accuser
also.
the
concept
of
fairness
must
not
be
strained
till
it
is
narrowed
to
a
filament.
we
ought
to
keep
the
balance
true.”
justice
therefore
is
due
to
the
accuser,
to
the
victim
of
a
crime,
to
the
people
of
the
state
and
we
ask
the
court
today
in
the
words
of
justice
cardozo
to
keep
the
balance
true.
the
balance
is
all
ready
weighted
in
favor
of
the
defendant
in
a
number
of
well-known
ways
to
the
court
and
i
shall
not
go
into
those.
i
will
refer
to
one
of
them
of
which
is
pertinent
here
that
is
that
if
the
defendant
testifies,
unlike
all
other
witnesses,
he
may
not
be
compelled
to
be
outside
the
courtroom
while
other
testimony
is
being
given.
the
petitioner
here
would
like
to
be
favored
even
further.
he
would
like
uniquely
among
all
the
witnesses
to
be
able
after
sitting
in
the
courtroom
and
hearing
the
testimony
of
his
own
witnesses
to
be
able
to
follow
him
to
the
stand
and
to
testify
in
conformity
to
what
they’ve
stated.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
well
it’s
not
unique.
it
is
done
in
48
states
but
a
--
unique
among
the
witnesses,
he
is
the
only
one
who
can
do
that.
and
he
would
like
to
be
able
to
do
that
in
tennessee.
but
to
proceed
under
the
sequestration
of
witnesses
rule,
none
of
the
state’s
witnesses
has
that
privilege
or
is
favored
as
this
petitioner
seeks
to
be
in
tennessee,
not
even
the
prosecuting
witness.
thus
a
citizen
may
be
assaulted
and
robbed
or
raped
and
as
the
prosecuting
witness,
he
or
she
may
not
under
the
sequestration
rule
remain
in
the
courtroom
and
hear
the
other
witnesses
for
the
state
before
testifying.
now,
in
order
for
the
prosecuting
witness
to
be
in
the
test
--
in
the
courtroom
and
to
assist
the
district
attorney
general
in
putting
all
of
the
state’s
file
to
the
case,
the
prosecuting
witness
must
go
on
first.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
mr.
justice,
we
don’t
have
any
decisions
on
that
point
but
it’s
my
opinion
that
that
could
be
done.
while
it
may
not,
the
people
of
tennessee
through
their
duly
elected
representatives
enact
and
maintain
a
statute
which
requires
in
at
least
to
this
area
that
the
defense
be
subject
to
the
same
procedure
of
requirements
as
the
prosecution.
that
the
accused,
that
he
has
to
testify
like
the
prosecuting
witness
who
testifies
and
remains
in
the
courtroom
must
testify
first
for
his
side.
while
in
the
name
of
truth
and
justice
and
to
keep
the
balance
true,
many
of
the
people
of
the
state
not
require
that.
the
court
may
--
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
yes,
indeed
it
does
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
it
does
not
and
that’s
what
--
that’s
part
of
the
problem
of
course.
that
the
defendant
and
i
referred
that
a
moment
ago
that
the
defendant
has
the
right,
he
is
favored
in
that
way
and
we
are
not
contesting
it
to
be
on
the
courtroom.
but
under
the
sequestration
of
witnesses
rule,
the
prosecuting
witness
may
not
be
there
and
do
the
same
thing
and
hear
the
other
witnesses
for
his
side
and
then
testify.
if
he
is
to
test
--
to
be
there,
he
has
to
testify
first.
now
this
is
closely
connected
of
course
with
the
sequestration
of
witnesses
rule
and
all
we
submit
that
all
the
policy
arguments
and
statements
that
favor
the
sequestration
of
witnesses
rule
argued
in
favor
of
the
tennessee
statute.
to
make
the
sequestration
of
witnesses
rule
more
effective,
some
states
in
fact
this
object
the
parties
to
that
rule
in
several
cases.
and
a
number
of
courts
in
several
cases
have
required
the
parties
to
testify
first.
we
note
this
on
page
7
of
our
brief.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
it
stated
i
think
in
the
brief
for
the
petitioner
but
i
don’t
have
that
date
in
mind,
no
sir.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
i
think
perhaps
--
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
that’s
perhaps
is
right,
i
think
that’s
right.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
never,
never
been
changed
in
the
state,
never
to
my
knowledge
been
challenged
until
over
the
last
year
or
two
and
i
think,
and
that
definitely
go
even
further,
it
is
not
being
challenged
anywhere
except
in
the
city
of
chattanooga
and
balance,
summers
says,
has
got
in
here.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
yes,
sir
and
it
by
the
--
and
i’ll
get
to
this
in
a
moment.
mr.
summers
in
err
--
is
in
error
in
saying
only
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
has
sustained
such
a
rule
in
the
federal
district
court
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief.
the
ninth
circuit
has
also
sustained
that
procedure
in
the
federal
district
court.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
he
has
that
right
in
tennessee,
he
needs
--
has
it
by
the
statute,
i
don’t
think
that’s
really
an
issue.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
that
the
--
that
his
counsel
has
the
right
to
direct
a
statement
and
to
have
to
do
that
of
the
defendant
and
i
would
not
follow
that.
we
certainly
believe
the
defendant
ought
to
be
to
testify
in
his
own
behalf
and
our
statutes
provide
that.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
well,
it’s
simply
a
matter
of
procedure
to
hogan
which
these
witnesses
go
on.
farther
--
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
yes.
that’s
the
way
that
the
trial
court
viewed
it
and
the
statute
reads
somewhat
in
that
way
although
our
appellate
courts
have
been
some
what
liberal
in
the
interpretation
of
it
in
permitting
the
defendant
to
testify
on
rebuttal
even
when
he
hasn’t
testified
on
the
writ
or
in
the
main
part
of
the
case.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
that’s
martin
versus
state,
151
tennessee
383,
it’s
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
no,
sir,
the
--
it’s
been
relaxed
or
that
decision
to
the
extent
that
that
although
it
appears
to
read
in
mandatory
language,
the
parties
may
waive
it
or
the
--
and
the
defendant
is
permitted
to
testify
in
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
sir?
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
of
the
--
the
defendant
wanted
to
go
on
first
and
the
court
would
not
let
him
do
that,
that’s
right.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
i’m
sorry.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
that’s
a
slip,
he
did
not
want
to
go
on
first.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
the
supreme
court
--
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
the
supreme
court
denied
certiorari
and
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
sustained
the
decision
to
the
trial
court
that
the
statute
did
not
permit
him
to
go
on
at
a
later
time.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
they
were
not
--
i
don’t
know
whether
they
were
invoked
by
anyone.
they
weren’t
referred
to
and
it’s
true
that
the
defendant
was
not
able
to
go
on
out
of
order.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
he
did
not
get
what
he
wanted.
i
would
like
to
refer
the
court
to
the
fact
and
how
important
this
is,
i
don’t
know
that
this
is
not
unique
in
tennessee.
it’s
all
ready
been
alluded
to
that
the
state
of
kentucky
has
a
similar
statute
that’s
been
on
the
books
for
79
years
and
to
my
knowledge
has
not
been
challenged
the
question
as
to
its
constitutionality.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit,
five
of
the
six
judges
in
those
cases
that
heard
those
cases
approved
the
rule
in
the
federal
district
courts,
it
is
a
rule
--
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
sir?
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
it
came
up
from
the
western
--
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
yes.
and
then
the
three
judges
in
the
ninth
circuit
court
--
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
were
not
tennessee
lawyers.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
it
was
a
court
ruling,
there
was
no
federal
statute
involved.
the
district
court
judge
simply
--
well,
it’s
quoted
on
page
8
of
our
brief.
the
defendant
wanted
to
--
well,
the
court
said
that
if
the
defendant
was
going
to
testify
in
his
own
behalf,
he
have
to
proceed
all
the
other
witnesses
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
and
i
quote
just
a
little
bit
from
that
says
that,
“trial
court’s
ruling
seems
to
be
a
sensible
approach
to
the
problem
of
what
to
do
with
the
party
who
is
also
a
witness
when
the
exclusion
of
witnesses
is
called
for
in
order
to
prevent
fabrication
of
testimony
and
cites
wigmore
on
evidence
and
goes
on
to
say
that
there
is
no
prejudice
shown
and
the
only
connection
we
can
think
of
the
appellant
was
rendered
incapable
of
tailoring
his
own
testimony
to
fit
in
with
what
previously
was
said
by
other
witnesses.”
and
beside
the
american
jurisdictions
that
we’ve
referred
to,
a
number
of
english
speaking
jurisdictions
have
had
this
rule
and
still
have
it.
and
we
refer
in
--
on
pages
10
and
11
to
--
a
case
from
alberta,
canada
in
which
the
court
said
to
be
called
as
the
first
witness
for
the
defense
or
that
the
accuse
ought
to
be
called
as
the
first
witness
for
the
offense
because
otherwise
its
--
observation
to
the
jury
that
the
accused
has
called
it
or
adopted
his
evidence
that
fit
in
with
the
evidence
of
the
witnesses
who
proceeded
him.
and
we
refer
to
an
australian
case
upholding
the
rule
and
i
think
significantly
in
england,
a
rule
that’s
been
a
matter
of
practice
since
at
least
1911,
only
recently
in
1968
by
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
in
--
or
the
court
of
appeals
in
criminal
division
in
england
in
a
unanimous
decision
was
made
a
rule
of
court
for
england
and
the
justice
who
wrote
the
opinion
for
that
court
in
1968
said
in
part,
the
reason
for
this
is
obvious.
it’s
that
if
they
are
to
be
permitted
to
hear
the
evidence,
that
is
the
defendants
or
other
witnesses,
they
may
be
tempted
to
turn
their
own
evidence
and
we
get
and
i
will
get
to
this
a
bit
later
if
i
have
the
time.
this
shows
the
reason
of
a
rationality
of
the
rule
and
mr.
summers
saw
the
petitioner
contends
that
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
it’s
an
unreasonable
rule
and
we
contend
that
it’s
imminently
a
reasonable
rule
and
this
court
all
said
so
that
i
referred
to.
so
we
have
to
take
the
position
that
the
tennessee
rule
is
a
truth
in
testimonial
law,
a
truth
in
testimonial
law
that
it
promotes
truthful
testimony
that
it’s
a
rational,
a
logical,
a
legitimate
complement
of
the
sequestration
of
witnesses
rule.
now,
i
think
remarkably
if
the
court
would
look
at
the
pages
that
i’m
going
to
refer
you
to
now
in
the
petitioner’s
brief
that
there
is
a
concession
of
rationality
there.
so
at
page
9
of
the
petitioner’s
brief,
he
says
that
the
fact
that
a
party
may
not
be
placed
under
the
rule,
that
is
the
sequestration
rule,
was
probably
one
of
the
chief
reasons
for
the
requirement.
and
then
he
says
at
page
9
that
requiring
the
defendant
to
testify
first
if
he
testifies
at
all
ensures
that
he
will
not
be
tempted
to
alter
his
own
testimony
after
hearing
other
evidence
presented
in
his
behalf
and
the
petitioner
says
further
at
pages
7
and
8
that
the
occasional
readiness
of
the
interested
person
to
adopt
his
testimony
when
offered
later
to
a
victory
rather
than
to
a
veracity
so
as
to
meet
the
necessities
is
laid
opened
by
a
file
of
witnesses
is
a
rationale
basis
for
the
tennessee
statutes
in
question.
and
then
finally
at
page
17
of
the
petitioner’s
brief,
the
petitioner
says,
the
purpose
of
this
code
section
to
ensure
that
a
defendant
not
be
tempted
to
color
his
version
of
the
circumstances
by
hearing
witnesses
in
favor
prior
to
his
own
testimony
is
perhaps
legitimate.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
he
said
all
of
this
things
and
i
applaud
him
for
his
fairness,
true.
but
the
--
and
he
does
view
this
as
a
burden
and
the
state
will
say
that
that
sometimes
it
may
appear
to
be
an
inconvenience
to
the
defendant
but
it’s
an
inconvenience
to
the
state
to
have
the
limitation
that’s
placed
upon
it.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
no,
i
think
my
point
--
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
true
and
i
wasn’t
present
at
the
trial.
the
district
attorney
general
took
care
of
the
trial
and
this
--
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
true
and
i
can
only
speculate
that
it
really
probably
didn’t
make
any
difference
to
the
state
in
this
case
because
they
have
confessed
(voice
overlap).
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
all
might,
it’s
very
ancient.
i
think
it’s
been
in
effect
to
all
the
way
back
as
far
as
--
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
well,
the
statute
was
--
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
that’s
when
the
limitation
was
first
put
on.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
it
did
not
state
it
there
but
we
have
by
judicial
decision
the
requirement
of
the
prosecuting
witness
so
far.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
i
don’t
know
that
your
honor.
i
think
when
it
first
came
up
that
the
court
ruled
that
way.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
i
don’t
think
it’s
a
matter
of
due
process,
your
honor.
i
think
it’s
a
matter
and
in
fact
the
number
of
courts
in
the
--
that
court
rule
simply
as
a
procedure
for
regulating
the
order
in
that
testimony.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
i
don’t
understand
the
question.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
that’s
true
your
honor,
if
he’s
going
to
testify,
he
has
to
testify
first.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
and
i
think
it’s
proposed
in
this
committee
recommendation.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
sir?
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
it
is,
yes.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
no,
he
was
a
man
who
had
his
a
store.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
well
--
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
the
state
is
the
party.
that’s
true
but
i
don’t
think
it’s
correct
to
say
that
the
prosecuting
witness
has
no
interest
in
the
outcome,
well,
when
he’s
been
robbed
and
he
wants
to
see
justice
there
and
he
is
the
chief
witness
to
the
state.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
yes,
he
does.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
yes,
he
does.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
it’s
not
a
matter
of
law,
the
judge
routinely
says
that
parties
want
the
rule
and
rather
routine
as
they
say
we
do.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
yes.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
that
goes
in
there.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
the
sequestration
rule?
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
well,
if
the
--
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
if
the
state
--
both
parties
have
to
waive
the
rule
and
then
the
rule
is
not
in
effect.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
the
statute
still
is
in
effect,
that’s
right.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
i
don’t
know
that
we
have
to
meet
it.
the
judges
though
will
apply
the
statute
unless
it’s
waived
by
the
state
and
sometimes
the
state
offers
to
waive
it
in
and
then
the
defendant
may
go
on
when
he
wants
to,
agrees
to
waive.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
i
do
not
remember
that,
it
was
invoked.
and
we
refer
the
court
at
pages
13
and
14
to
the
decision
which
requires
this
to
the
prosecution
--
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
yes
sir,
i’m
sorry
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice,
pages
13
and
14
of
our
brief.
we
refer
to
the
judicial
requirement
that
the
prosecution
or
the
prosecuting
witness
go
on
first.
i
hope
we’ve
been
able
to
demonstrate
that
what
we
have
in
tennessee
here
then
is
not
a
unique
requirement
but
even
if
it
was
unique
requirement
that
would
make
it
unconstitutional.
under
our
federal
system
of
government
the
states
are
--
as
mr.
justice
brandeis
said
are
laboratories
in
which
experimentation
may
be
made
and
referred
to
an
opinion
by
justice
blackmun
in
mckeiver
versus
pennsylvania
on
page
15
of
our
brief
to
the
same
effect.
so,
we
submit
that
a
judge
should
not
vote
against
this
rule
of
procedure
simply
because
he
disagrees
with
it
as
a
matter
of
policy
or
i
would
personally
prefer
an
ultimate
procedure
and
we
refer
to
the
court
to
justice
harlan’s
opinion
in
mcgautha
versus
california
in
1971
decision
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
402
u.s.
183
and
221
and
we
refer
the
court
also
to
mr.
justice
stewart’s
concurring
opinion
in
spencer
versus
u.s.
also
cited
in
our
brief
--
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
against
texas,
385
u.s.
352
and
567,
thank
you
sir.
now
in
the
time
which
may
remains
me,
i’d
like
to
turn
to
the
petitioners
objections
to
the
tennessee
statute
and
i
understand
from
his
oral
argument
yesterday
that
he
does
conceive
that
the
sixth
amendment
question
is
not
before
the
court
in
view
of
the
limited
grant
of
certiorari.
his
fifth
amendment
argument
as
i
gather
is
that
this
rule
in
some
way
infringes
upon
the
defendant’s
right
to
remain
silent
and
by
the
way
rather
remarkably,
i
think
later
on
he
argues
under
the
tennessee
constitution
provision
that
it
also
infringes
his
right
to
be
heard
but
now
he
says
it
infringes
upon
his
right
to
silent.
but
at
page
16
of
his
brief
he
concedes,
“nor
does
it
deny
a
defendant
to
their
right
to
remain
silent.”
his
point
seems
to
be
that
because
he
has
to
go
on
first,
if
he
goes
on
at
all
that
this
is
cutting
down
on
his
privilege
or
chilling
it
in
some
way
and
that
it
makes
it
more
difficult.
the
states
answer
to
this
is,
that
petitioner
and
his
counsel
ought
to
know
before
they
get
to
trial.
but
the
testimony
will
be
what
the
witnesses
will
say
and
the
desirability
for
waiving
the
right
to
remain
silent
and
taking
the
stand
in
its
own
behalf.
our
feeling
about
is
that
the
only
thing
that
is
limited
as
far
as
the
defendant
is
concerned
is
the
opportunity
to
trim
or
to
color
or
to
falsify
his
testimony
to
conform
of
what
the
other
witnesses
on
his
side
have
said
and
this
is
what
this
case
is
uniformly
say
that
we
have
all
ready
referred
the
court
to.
the
defendant
says
that
in
choosing
to
testify
more
making
at
charge
at
the
beginning
of
his
proof.
he
then
hazards
himself
through
the
cross
examination
or
subjects
himself
to
the
hazards
of
cross
examination,
indeed
he
does.
but
every
witness
who
goes
on
the
stand
subjects
himself
to
that
hazard
and
the
defendant
will
be
subjected
to
that
hazard
regardless
of
when
he
takes
the
stand.
another
point
he
makes
is
that
choosing
to
testify
the
beginning
of
this
proof
is
a
matter
which
should
be
left
to
his
unfretted
freedom.
now,
we
point
out
at
pages
18
and
19
of
our
brief
that
the
defendant
has
the
unfretted
freedom
to
testify.
he
only
--
he
is
restricted
as
to
when
he
can
testify
and
we
cite
them
mcgautha
versus
california
to
the
effect
that
it’s
not
unconstitutional
simply
to
make
him
exercise
a
difficult
choice.
i
would
like
to
move
quickly
to
his
fourteenth
amendment
argument
which
our
view
is
in
three
parts.
one
is
that
it
imposes
a
burden
upon
him.
it
does
into
some
extent
limit
him
but
again,
i
remind
the
court
that
he’s
not
restricted
from
testifying.
he
may
testify.
the
court
though
will
require
him
to
testify
first.
but
there
is
no
reason
why
he
has
to
hear
the
testimony
of
his
own
witnesses
before
he
takes
the
stand.
a
lot
of
good
reasons
why
he
has
to
hear
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses
of
the
state
against
him
but
he
ought
to
know
before
his
own
witnesses
take
the
stand
what
they
are
going
to
say.
now,
if
they
crack
up
on
the
cross
examination
then
it
would
be
beneficial
to
him
to
be
able
to
get
back
on
the
stand
and
to
rehabilitate
the
case
i
suppose.
the
second
--
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
well,
he
has
opened
to
him
an
opportunity
before
taking
--
discover
deposition
in
advance
in
the
trial
and
know
--
and
to
know
under
oath
what
the
officer
is
going
to
say.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
that’s
my
remembrance
of
it
your
honor.
i
would
not
like
to
be
held
to
that
but
that
that’s
the
way
i
remember
it.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
that’s
certainly
true
in
civil
cases
and
--
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
i
know
you
are
and
i
just
have
to
say
i
don’t
have
a
clear
--
i
am
not
entirely
sure
of
that.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
all
right.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
but
he
may
go
out
--
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
if
all
those
things
are
done.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
and
what’s
the
question?
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
no.
you
don’t
know
where
you
stand
on
the
defense.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
i
don’t
remember
that
all
of
those
things
were
true
about
him
having
been
subpoenaed
--
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
yes,
that’s
right,
if
he
called
him,
he
would
have
been
the
witness
of
the
defendant
but
we
don’t
conceive
that
that
in
any
way
denies
this
defendant
of
his
fourteenth
amendment
or
due
process
rise
and
may
i
just
tell
--
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
you
certainly
should
be
able
to
interview
your
witnesses
in
advance
unless
you
make
the
spot
decision
after
you
get
to
court
that
you
are
going
to
call
some
witness
you
have
thought
of
calling
to
the
court
and
i
don’t
know
of
any
reason
why
this
defendant
in
this
case
did
not
have
interviewed
the
chief
or
anybody
else
that
he
wanted
to
out
of
a
trial.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
to
allow
him
to
be
recalled
to
the
stand
after
he
wants
to
testify
and
your
honor
may
i
--
i
have
seen
the
red
light.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
i
would
like
to
make
a
concluding
statement
if
it
please
the
court.
mr.
robert
e.
kendrick
the
only
other
point
that
i
haven’t
covered
and
i
will
cover
it
in
one
sentence,
concerns
the
matter
of
the
state
constitution.
it’s
contended
that
the
tennessee
courts
have
misconstrued
the
statute
in
holding
that
it
is
not
unconstitutional
on
its
state
constitution
and
i
would
like
to
refer
the
court
throughout
the
cases
that
we
cite
and
filed
proposition
of
our
brief
to
the
effect
that
that
is
decisions
of
this
court
that
that
is
really
a
matter
for
the
state
courts
to
decide
whether
state
statute
violate
the
state
constitution
and
it’s
not
a
federal
question
for
this
court
to
be
concerned
with.
in
conclusion,
i
would
simply
say
that
the
defendant
has
not
made
out
a
case
that
runs
constitutionality
of
this
truth
and
testimonial
law
and
we
do
ask
the
court
in
the
words
of
justice
cardozo
to
keep
the
balance
true.
thank
you.
