you
in
this
case,
question
mr.
browne
the
availability
of
federal
habeas
corpus
to
attack
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
permissibility
of
the
evidences
in
a
state
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
federal
system
by
the
district
court
and
twice
by
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
because
your
point
as
i
understand
it
mr.
hennessey
is
that
under
connecticut
law
the
possession
of
a
gun
is
no
more
a
badge
of
criminality
and
the
fact
the
man
might
have
a
hat
on
him?
justice
potter
stewart
it
means
there
is
probable
cause?
justice
potter
stewart
the
informer
did
tell
the
officer
that
the
man
sitting
in
the
car
across
the
street
had
narcotics
in
his
possession?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
officer
testified
that
he
had
reason
to
believe
that
this
as
a
reliable
informer?
justice
potter
stewart
why
wasn't
there
--
why
don't
you
at
least
argue
that
there
is
probable
cause
to
search
for
narcotics?
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
an
