well,
didn't
terry
proceed
on
the
assumption
that
in
any
circumstances
such
as
in
terry,
officers
wouldn't
be
deterred
at
all,
because
they
felt
that
the
situation
demanded
some
action
and
there
was
no
use
in
trying
to
deter?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
judge
friendly,
i
suppose
would
have
conceded,
however,
that
if
the
informer
had
just
simply
said,
i
saw
the
gun
in
his
waistband,
that
the
officer
could
have
done
what
he
did?
justice
byron
r.
white
reliable
informant
and
there
is
a
basis
given
for
the
informant's
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
wouldn't
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn't
that
be
stronger
because
he
actually
went
there
and
found
what
the
informant
said
he
found,
i
mean,
at
least
there
was
a
man
there?
justice
byron

white
your
claim
that
the
officer
wasn't
(inaudible)
justice
byron

white
i
said
assuming
the
reasonable
suspicion
under
(inaudible)
justice
byron

white
(inaudible)
suspicion
that
he
does
have
a
gun.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
am
just
saying
that
here
the
suspicion
that
he
had
included
that
of
a
gun,
he
had
some
reasonable
suspicions,
thinking
he
might
be
in
a
dangerous
situation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
further
assume
the
reasonableness
of
the
suspicion?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
decision
about
the
informant
insofar
as
telling
the
truth
is
concerned?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
that
judge
friendly
indicated
that
if
the
informant
had
said
in
addition
to
who
he
was,
and
what
is
his
experience
with
the
police
had
been,
if
he
had
said
in
addition,
i
saw
the
gun,
that
this
is
--
there
would
have
been
probable
cause.
justice
byron

white
assuming
for
the
moment
that
the
informer
was
reliable
in
the
sense
of
the
first
leg
of
the
informant
reliability
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
the
officer
was
justified
in
believing
the
informant
was
telling
the
truth.
justice
byron
r.
white
your
position
still
is
that
that
doesn't
give
him
reasonable
cause,
or
reasonable
suspicion
under
terry
to
make
a
stop?
justice
byron
r.
white
[voice

has
decided
though
that
under
its
law
when
an
officer
finds
a
gun
in
somebody's
waistband
they
can
be
arrested
and
convicted
for
it.?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
a
result
of
the
state
court
proceedings
of
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
doesn't
get
you
very
far
because
your
point
is
either
the
informant
was
reliable,
when
he
finds
a
gun
you
can't
arrest
because
it
doesn't
give
you
probable
cause
to
arrest.

they

they

they

seize

you
don't

the

was

of
heroin?

this
was
terry,

suspension?
justice

you
aren't
