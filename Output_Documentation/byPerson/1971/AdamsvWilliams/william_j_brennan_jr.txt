you
said
earlier,
you
said
the
crux
was
whether
there
was
sufficient
cause
for
reaching
into
the
car.
am
i
wrong,
looking
at
the
appendix
8
in
the
petition,
per
curiam
phrases
that
whether
there
was
any
other
sufficient
cause
that
this
in
addition
to
a
probable
cause
for
arrest,
for
reaching
into
williams'
waistband?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
says
for
reaching
into
williams'
waistband?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
wasn't
the
window
uped
and
the
officer
ask
to
--?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
was
asked
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
does
this
imply
that
there
was
a
sufficient
cause
for
reaching
into
the
car,
but
not
at
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
judge
friendly
i
gather
and
dissenter,
if
i
read
that
correctly,
it
seemed
that
is
in
the
panel
dissent?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
seem
to
indicate
that
it
turned
on
whether
or
not
he
should
have
approached
the
car,
he
didn't
have
probable
cause
for
arrest,
but
was
he
justified
in
approaching
the
car
on
the
basis
of
the
information
from
the
unnamed
informer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
am
just
looking
at
the
sentence.
“almost
everything
must
therefore
turn
on
what
the
unnamed
informer
said
and
the
value
of
his
statement,”
and
then
he
goes
on,
“in
his
judgment
didn't
satisfy
the
requirements
of
draper
and
those
other
cases.”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
it
simply
has
to
be
on
these
facts
whether
he
was
justified
in
the
approaching
the
car
at
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
surely,
if
he
was
justified
in
approaching
the
car,
then
i
expect
no
one
can
call
that
he
then
reached
for
the
gun
in
open
view?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
it
does
have
to
narrow
down
to
whether
he
was
justified
in
approaching
the
car
car
at
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let's
suppose
it
mr.
browne
that
instead
of
sitting
in
the
car,
williams
had
been
standing
at
curb
and
sergeant
connolly
acted
on
precisely
the
same
information
on
which
he
did
act
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
that
be
covered
by
terry?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
you
think
this
case
should
be
decided
as
it
would
be
decided
if
the
hypothetical
i
put
you
was
the
case,
that
is
of
standing
there
and
the
officer
acting
on
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
simply
if
he
is
in
the
automobile,
it
doesn't
like
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
suppose
officer
connolly
had
been
at
the
police
station
blocks
away
when
the
informant
told
him
just
what
he
told
him
on
the
gas
station.
connolly
got
into
the
squad
car
and
went
down
and
then
everything
happened
that
happened
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
am
checking
precisely
these
facts
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
except
that
he
got
the
information
at
the
police
station
several
blocks
away
from
informant
rather
than
the
gas
station
across
the
street?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
was
the
machete?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
it
in
open
view
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
underneath
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
just
ask
a
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
crime
connected
with
the
gun
was
he
convicted?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
if
he
didn't
fall
within
one
of
the
exceptions
where
he
didn't
need
a
permit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
get
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
was
arrested
and
the
basis
of
the
arrest
was
the
gun,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
suggest
that
the
mere
fact
that
he
has
a
gun
does
not
justify
under
connecticut
law
an
arrest,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
say
that
sergeant
connolly
had
to
know
or
have
probable
cause
to
believe
for
making
an
arrest
for
possession
of
the
gun
that
he
did
not
have
a
permit
for
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
he
hands
off
to
the
officer,
in
the
same
set
of
facts
that
chief
justice
gave
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
the
hypothetical
that
chief
justice
gave
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
sees
that
he
is
pointing
the
gun
and
he
is
crouched
over
pointing
it,
and
the
officer
turns
up,
what
are
you
doing,
he
gives
the
same
story
that
chief
suggested
but
then
he
adds
to
it,
here
is
my
permit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
suppose
there
were
no
gun
involved
in
this
at
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
where
no
gun
involved
in
this
at
all,
but
the
machete
and
the
informant
had
simply
said
that
the
officer
look
at
this
fellow
is
a
heroin
addict
and
he
has
got
a
machete
on
this
person,
and
you
need
to
of
careful,
he
is
likely
use
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
not
a
machete,
but
he
has
got
an
iron
--
a
fire
iron
on
him.
he
used
that
as
a
weapon
supposing
even
that
(inaudible)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
don't
you
go
beyond
that,
that
even
if
it
did,
even
if
it
did,
that
that
would
not
justify,
the
fact
that
he
can
make
a
stop
would
not
justify
the
seizures
of
the
machete
and
narcotics
and
arrest?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
browne,
do
i
get
your
--
the
state's
position
accurately
that
you
do
concede
that
you
can't
support
the
searches,
that
is
machete
and
the
heroin
seized
from
the
person
without
a
finding
that
the
arrest
was
on
probable
cause?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
you
don't
try
to
support
them
on
any
theory
that
this
was
a
terry
kind
of
search
and
to
the
extent
that

i
mean,
terry
kind
of
detention
and
to
the
extent
it
was,
that
that
would
