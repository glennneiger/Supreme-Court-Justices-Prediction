mr.
donald
a.
browne
thank
you,
your
honor.
so
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
evolves
from
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
which
was
filed
by
the
present
respondent,
robert
williams
in
1969
in
the
federal
district
court
in
the
district
of
connecticut.
mr.
williams
had
been
arrested
in
the
city
of
bridgeport,
connecticut
in
october,
1966.
he
had
been
charged
with
a
number
of
state
criminal
violations
relative
to
his
possession
of
a
quantity
of
heroin,
a
pistol,
and
a
machete.
in
those
state
prosecutions,
mr.
williams
had
filed
motions
to
suppress
those
items
to
prevent
them
from
being
used
as
evidence
in
his
state
trials.
these
motions
were
denied.
mr.
williams
was
subsequently
convicted.
he
took
an
appeal
to
the
state's
supreme
court
for
the
state
of
connecticut
which
affirmed
his
conviction
and
likewise
ruled
that
the
items
which
had
been
taken
from
this
possession
by
a
bridgeport
police
officer
had
not
been
taken
illegally
or
in
any
violation
of
his
constitutional
rights.
thereafter,
mr.
williams
filed
the
instant
petition
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
in
connecticut.
that
court
ruled
likewise
that
his
rights
had
not
been
violated.
they
affirmed
the
prior
decisions
of
the
connecticut
courts.
thereafter,
the
matter
was
appealed
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
initially,
that
court
again
affirmed
the
lower
court,
the
district
court
ruling
by
a
divided
court,
2
to
1
decision.
the
respondent
thereafter
petitioned
for
a
rehearing
and
a
rehearing
en
banc
was
granted
and
the
result
of
which
was
a
per
curiam
decision
which
reversed
the
lower
court's,
the
prior
court
decisions
and
ruled,
in
fact,
that
the
bridgeport
police
officer
had
no
constitutional
basis
or
no
valid
reason
for
removing
certain
items
from
mr.
williams'
possession.
i
think
that
factually
the
facts
are
not
in
great
detail.
it
is
a
relatively
simple
factual
situation,
in
that
on
the
early
morning
of
october
20,
1966,
a
bridgeport
police
sergeant
by
the
name
of
john
connolly
who
was
veteran
of
20
years
service
on
the
bridgeport
police
department
was
on
petrol
duty
alone
in
the
city
of
bridgeport
in
a
particular
area
of
the
city
which
was
noted
for
a
high
incidents
of
crime.
at
that
time
he
was
in
a
gasoline
station
at
the
intersection
of
two
public
streets
in
the
city.
he
met
and
he
had
a
conversation
with
a
person
whom
he
knew,
who
was
known
to
him,
that
particular
person
indicated
to
him
that
there
was
another
person
seated
in
an
automobile
nearby
in
a
street
known
as
hamilton
street
and
that
that
person,
who
incidentally
developed
to
be
the
respondent
robert
williams,
that
he
had
drugs
and
then
he
had
a
pistol
in
his
waistband.
thereafter,
the
officer
proceeded
out
of
the
gasoline
station
across
the
street
of
hamilton
street
to
the
particular
automobile.
he
knocked
on
the
window
of
the
car,
he
asked
the
respondent
to
open
the
car
door.
in
response
thereto
mr.
williams
rolled
down
the
automobile
window
on
the
passenger
side.
the
officer
immediately
placed
one
hand
in
through
the
open
car
window
inside
of
the
respondent's
coat
which
was
open
and
directly
on
to
the
handle
of
a
pistol,
which
he
seized
and
removed
from
the
respondent.
apparently,
the
coat
was
open,
he
apparently
didn't
touch
mr.
williams'
body
at
all
other
than
inside
of
his
coat.
the
revolver
was
fully
loaded.
he
then
proceeded
to
place
mr.
williams
under
arrest,
advised
him
of
his
constitutional
rights
relative
to
statements.
then
a
further
search
was
conducted
of
the
person
of
mr.
williams
which
disclosed
a
quantity
of
heroin,
at
two
locations
on
his
person
and
a
search
was
conducted
of
the
automobile
there
on
hamilton
street
which
disclosed
a
large
machete
concealed
under
the
passenger
seat
where
mr.
williams
had
been
seated.
as
i
indicated
earlier,
there
were
motions
made
within
the
state
courts
to
suppress
these
items
as
evidence.
there
is
no
dispute
that
they
were
timely
made,
they
were
overruled,
the
matter
was
affirmed
by
the
connecticut
supreme
court
and
the
united
states
district
court
reversed
in
per
curium
opinion
from
which
my
client,
the
warden
into
actuality
of
the
state
of
connecticut
petition
for
certiorari
which
was
granted.
the
state,
the
warden
petitioner
in
the
various
courts
in
which
this
has
been
presented
has
tried
to
urge
that
the
issues
here
to
be
framed
in
the
dual
consideration
which
is
presented
within
the
decision
of
the
terry
case,
more
particularly
at
page
20
of
the
terry
case.
i
think
it
goes
without
saying
that,
it's
the
position
of
the
petitioner
that
many
statements
contained
within
the
decision
of
terry
versus
united
states
both
within
the
majority
decision
and
the
concurring
decision
are
uniquely
applicable
to
the
factual
situations
in
the
case
of
robert
williams.
in
the
terry
decision,
at
page
20
of
the
reported
decision,
the
chief
justice
urges
that
a
dual
consideration
must
be
inquired
into
when
determining
in
this
type
of
a
situation,
where
a
officer
making
a
self-protection
search
and
the
first
consideration
is
whether
the
officer's
actions
were
justified
at
their
inception
and
second
consideration
is
whether
the
activities
or
actions
were
related
reasonably
in
scope
to
the
circumstances
which
justify
the
interference.
and
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
the
actions
of
the
officer,
officer
john
connolly
in
leaving
the
gasoline
station
after
he
received
this
particular
information,
which
is
i
indicated,
was
from
a
person
who
he
knew
by
name
and
who
he
had
had
prior
conversations
with
and
whom
he
believed
to
be
a
person
who
was
trustworthy
and
reliable.
that
his
actions
in
leaving
the
gas
station
on
the
basis
of
that
information
in
going
over
to
the
automobile
to
make
the
investigation,
a
further
investigation
were
completely
justified.
i
would
point
out
that
in
most
of
the
reported
cases,
i
think
that
most
of
the
cases
that
i
have
read
which
relate
to
street
investigations
in
which
an
officer
receives
information
and
then
proceeds
to
make
some
sort
of
an
investigation.
i
think
the
great
majority
of
those
cases
involve
situations
where
the
officer
receives
his
information
from
someone
who
is
unknown
to
him,
from
a
person
who
comes
up
to
him
and
relates
to
him
that
some
unusual
activity
or
some
type
of
criminality
is
taking
place
and
then
he
makes
his
decision
to
proceed
or
not
proceed
or
whatever
he
is
going
to
do.
but
i
think
it's
of
considerable
importance
here
that
that
was
not
the
situation
here.
this
is
not
the
situation
where
a
person
who
was
stranger
to
an
officer
comes
up
and
indicates
information
to
him
on
basis
of
which
he
makes
his
investigation.
i
think,
is
relevant,
because
in
the
case
of
an
unknown
or
unnamed
individual,
the
individual
after
giving
the
information
can
go
about
his
ways
and
quite
possibly
never
be
located
by
the
officer
again,
whereas
this
is
not
the
situation.
here
the
officer
knew
this
individual
and
knew
him
my
name
and
of
course
if
the
information
had
been
incorrect,
he
could
come
back
and
locate
that
person
additionally
and
inquire
as
to
why
it
had
been
made
to
him.
the
officer
arrives
at
the
side
of
the
car
in
which
mr.
williams
was
seated,
the
window
was
lowered
and
i
think
that
then
he
had
to
make
the
decision,
which
in
all
probability
is
the
crux
of
this
particular
case,
and
that
is
whether
or
not
he
was
justified
in
reaching
his
hand
in
through
the
open
window
and
into
the
waist
of
the
respondent
where
he
found
and
came
in
contact
with
the
handle
of
the
revolver
and
removed
it.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
yes,
that
appears
in
several
places
within
the
appendix,
within
his
testimony.
i
don't
have
the
pages
right
in
front
of
me,
but
it
does
appear
within
the
appendix
on
several
occasions
that
the
coat
was
open;
it
was
not
buttoned.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
yes,
he
was
justice
--
mr.
donald
a.
browne
he
received
a
sentence
on
the
possession
of
the
heroin
of
not
less
than
three
and
not
more
than
six
years
in
state's
prison.
he
received
one
year
sentence
which
was
consecutive
on
the
possession
of
the
pistol
without
a
permit
and
additional
one
year
sentence
on
the
possession
of
the
machete,
both
of
which
are
added
to
the
maximum
sentence
of
the
state
of
connecticut.
so
his
effective
sentence
was
not
less
than
three
and
not
more
than
eight
years
on
all
of
the
charges,
that
was
total
sentence.
again,
it's
the
position
of
the
petitioner
here
that
the
crux
of
the
case
amounts
or
evolves
to
whether
or
not
the
particular
officer
was
justified
reaching
into
the
automobile
and
placing
his
hand
on
the
handle
of
the
revolver
and
removing
it,
and
again
we
would
submit
that
it
was
a
decision
which
the
great
majority
of
trained
police
officers
in
that
circumstances
at
that
time
would
undoubtedly
have
done.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
no
i
do
not
--
mr.
donald
a.
browne
no,
we
have
never
contested
that.
we
have
never
contested
the
availability
of
that
particular
one.
i
would
remark
that
this
proceeding
today
is
the
seventh
time
in
which
this
particular
point
has
been
judicially
reviewed
by
a
court
or
courts.
in
other
words,
it
was
reviewed
three
times
within
the
state
system.
it
was
reviewed
prior
to
today,
three
times
in
the
federal
system
and
today
it
makes
the
seventh
time
within
which
it
has
been
further
reviewed
judicially.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
twice
by
the
second
court
of
appeals
for
second
circuit
and
today
it
makes
the
fourth
time.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
that's
correct,
into
the
car
and
into
his
waistband.
in
other
words,
he
reached
in
--
mr.
donald
a.
browne
into
the
waistband,
that's
correct.
now
again
quite
clearly
--
mr.
donald
a.
browne
williams
rolled
the
window
down.
so
window
wasn't
--
mr.
donald
a.
browne
he
was
asked
to
open
the
door,
and
he
in
response
rolled
the
window
down
and
the
officer
then
placed
his
car
--
his
hand
into
the
automobile
and
right
on
to
the
handle
of
the
revolver.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
i
assume
that
the
--
no,
i
assume
that
the
implication
of
the
per
curiam
sentence
is
that
there
was
no
sufficient
cause
to
reach
into
the
automobile
or
into
the
waistband.
i
think
it's
a
corollary
that
if
he
had
no
cause
to
reaching
to
the
waistband,
probably
he
didn't
have
any
cause
to
reach
into
the
car.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
well,
unfortunately
that's
the
reason
i
have
tried
to
framed
the
issues
in
the
way
that
i
have.
unfortunately,
in
the
one
or
two
sentence,
the
decision
by
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals,
they
did
not
indicate
within
that
decision
just
whether
they
were
saying
that
there
was
no
probable
cause
for
him
to
investigate
further,
whether
there
was
no
probable
cause
for
him
to
or
sufficient
cause
i
should
say,
for
him
to
leave
the
gasoline
station
and
go
over
to
the
automobile
or
whether
they
were
merely
saying
that
you
may
have
been
justified
in
going
over
to
the
automobile,
but
in
any
event
there
was
no
sufficient
cause
for
him
to
reach
in
and
remove
the
pistol.
i
think
that
it's
difficult
because
of
the
way
they
framed
their
opinion.
they
don't
say
necessarily
whether
they
are
including
the
fact
that
this
investigation
was
improper,
although
i
feel
and
my
brother
may
correct
me,
he
at
least
in
his
brief,
that
is
not
briefed
to
my
knowledge
any
claim
that
it
was
improper
or
imprudent
by
the
officer
to
make
this
investigation
in
the
manner
that
he
did.
i
think
the
claim
is
that
once
he
got
to
the
automobile,
he
should
not
have
inserted
his
hand
in
the
window.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
i
don't
think
that
--
my
recollection
of
the
opinion
of
justice
--
his
dissenting
opinion.
i
don't
think
he
ever
comes
out
and
says
categorically
that
connolly
should
never
have
left
the
gasoline
station
and
gone
over
to
the
respondent.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
my
recollection
of
the
dissent
of
judge
friendly
was
he
held
that
there
was
not
a
sufficient
basis
for
a
stop.
now
where
the
stop
was,
whether
the
stop
was,
actually
obviously
he
didn't
stop
mr.
williams
from
proceeding
in
any
manner,
because
mr.
william
wasn't
proceeding
any
place,
he
was
just
sitting
there.
so
there
wasn't
a
stop
in
the
idea
that
he
stopped
his
momentum
or
he
stopped
his
walking
or
he
stopped
his
activity.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
whether
he
is
justified
first
in
approaching
the
car?
obviously,
if
he
wasn't
approaching
--
mr.
donald
a.
browne
well,
that
would
be
my
position.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
and
again
i
have
taken
that
into
and
tried
to
frame
it
in
two
particular
issues
as
i
indicated
under
the
law
as
set
forth
in
the
terry.
one,
whether
he
was
justified
in
leaving
the
gasoline
station
and
walking
across
the
hamilton
street
to
the
automobile.
and
then
two,
once
you
put
him
next
to
the
automobile
and
the
window
goes
down,
is
he
secondarily
justified
in
reaching
in
to
remove
the
individual's
gun.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
well,
the
appendix
--
i
think
the
testimony
of
the
officer
is
clear
that
he
received
the
tip
in
the
gasoline
station.
now
there
was
a
hearing
by
judge
clary
in
united
states
district
court
to
clear
up
what
he
considered
to
be
a
discrepancy
between
the
officer's
earlier
testimony
and
the
officer's
testimony
in
the
superior
court
motion
to
suppress
at
the
trial
and
there
was
a
hearing
for
that
specific
purpose
and
the
conclusion
of
which
in
his
memorandum
of
the
decision,
the
judge
expressly
accepts
and
finds
the
finding
of
the
superior
court
to
be
completely
correct
and
he
adopts
them
as
the
findings
of
the
united
states
district
court.
so
i
don't
think
that
as
far
as
this
court
is
concerned,
there
is
any
question.
at
this
time
what
that
he
did
receive
that
information
in
the
gasoline
station
in
the
manner
in
which
he
testified
and
acted
accordingly.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
yes,
sir.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
no
question
about
it.
in
the
case
of
officer
connolly,
i
happen
to
know
that
he
has
since
retired.
he
is
no
longer
a
member
of
bridgeport
police
department.
so
it
will
have
no
effect
on
officer
connolly
obviously.
the
effect
that
it's
going
to
have
on
other
brother
police
officers,
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
is
going
to
deter
them
for
making
any
investigation
in
the
streets
when
they
receive
information
unless
they
can
categorically
substantiate
--
a
feeling
that
they
can
categorically
substantiate
that
they
are
not
going
to
be
criticized
or
that
any
evidence
which
their
investigation
discloses
is
not
going
to
be
ruled
or
suppressed
as
evidence
in
the
subsequent
proceedings.
if
anything
i
think
it's
going
to
substantially
deter
proper
police
protection.
i
would,
and
i
hesitate,
but
i
would
state
that
the
supreme
court
for
the
state
of
connecticut
rather
than
indicating
or
making
any
claim
that
officer
connolly
acted
with
insolence
or
acted
imprudently,
they
went
out
of
their
way
to
indicate
they
felt
he
was
a
brave
man,
that
he
displayed
a
degree
of
courage
in
going
over
to
the
particular
automobile
even
though
he
felt
that
there
was
an
individual
in
there
with
a
pistol
which
obviously
could
have
been
be
used
against
him,
and
i
don't
think
there
has
ever
been
any
claim
made
by
the
respondent
himself
that
officer
connolly
acted
imprudently
that
he
acted
--
mr.
donald
a.
browne
well,
i
can't
read
necessarily
that
your
honor's
conclusion
into
that
particular
decision,
but
i
think
that
--
i
think
terry
clearly
points
out
in
a
number
of
locations
that
one,
that
there
is
no
prohibition
against
the
officer
for
example
from
walking
--
from
stopping
a
person
on
the
street
and
asking
him
a
questions,
that
is
i
don't
think
that
a
big
deal.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
yes.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
it
would
be
covered
a
number
of
the
general
phrases
contained
within
the
terry
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
the
officer
is
acting
as
a
reasonably
prudent
person
under
all
of
the
circumstance.
obviously,
we
get
to
the
distinction
which
is
the
distinction
my
brother
urges
upon
the
court
and
that
is
between
some
time
of
a
movement
which
is
observed
by
the
officer
himself
or
whether
he
can
justify
a
protective
search
exclusively
on
the
basis
of
the
information
which
he
receives.
and
that
i
think
is
my
brother's
argument
and
his
claim
and
at
least
as
i
read
his
brief
is
that
in
order
for
any
police
officer
to
justify
a
protective
search,
a
self-protective
search,
he
must
be
able
to
point
to
some
matter
which
he
has
personally
observed
himself
which
indicates,
makes
him
feel
that
his
position
is
in
peril
and
that
justifies
him
to
go
ahead
and
make
this
particular
search.
i
think
he
urges
that
no
matter
how
strong
the
authenticity
of
the
information
which
is
received
that
a
police
officer
just
cannot
--
mr.
donald
a.
browne
i
cannot,
i
cannot
--
mr.
donald
a.
browne
no,
i
cannot
submit
to
your
honor
any
grave
justification
or
a
distinction
between
the
fact
that
he
was
standing
on
the
street
corner
or
the
fact
that
he
was
sitting
in
the
automobile
other
than
the
fact
that
being
in
the
automobile
it
might
have
been
considerably
more
difficult
for
connolly
to
observe
furtive
movement
such
as
a
moment
to
go
for
as
his
gun.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
i
would
assume
on
a
basis
of
judge
friendly
--
mr.
donald
a.
browne
i
can
only
submit
that
if
the
informant
had
said
i
saw
the
gun
there,
then
quite
possibly
the
officer
connolly
may
have
basis
to
go
over
and
make
an
arrest
--
mr.
donald
a.
browne
i
think,
i
submit
that
he
would
have,
i
submit
that
he
would
have.
if
the
informant
had
only
added
that
one
more
piece
of
information
that
“i
saw
the
gun,”
then
i
think
that
we
wouldn't
be
here
on
the
question
of
stop
and
frisk
or
a
protective
search.
i
think,
officer
connolly
would
have
had
simple
probable
cause
to
go
over
and
make
an
arrest
of
williams
without
regard
--
mr.
donald
a.
browne
well,
i
submit
that
--
are
you
including
the
fact
that
he
indicated
that
he
saw
the
gun
or
are
you
excluding
that?
mr.
donald
a.
browne
precisely
the
--
mr.
donald
a.
browne
well
that
of
course,
it
relates
again
to
the
propriety
of
an
investigation,
obviously
he
wouldn't
have
had
probable
course
for
an
arrest
in
those
--
we
really
even
know
that
he
knew
mr.
williams'
name
--
mr.
donald
a.
browne
that's
right,
that's
correct.
if
there
would
have
been
like
substantially
more
collaboration
of
the
information
that
he
had
received,
the
existence
of
a
man
in
an
automobile
out
at
hamilton
street
at
that
particular
time
would
have
been
collaborative
of
the
information
supplied
by
the
reporting
witness
to
him
(inaudible)
things.
as
i
understand
again,
finally
my
brother's
position,
it
would
be
that
no
matter
how
authentic
the
information
received
if
the
informant
had
been
a
judge
or
the
informant
had
been
three
or
four
judges,
still
unless
officer
connolly
personally
observed
something
in
the
nature
of
a
furtive
movement
or
furtive
action,
he
still
couldn't
proceed
and
to
proceed,
it
would
be
illogical
or
unreasonable
for
him
to
fear
that
his
life
was
in
peril
and
consequently
it
would
have
been
illogical
for
him
to
make
the
protective
search
at
that
particular
time.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
no,
the
search
of
the
automobile
itself
hinges
upon
obviously
whether
or
not
the
disclosure
of
the
pistol
supplied
sufficient
probable
cause
for
him
to
place
him
under
arrest.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
after
he
found
the
pistol,
he
proceeded
to
place
him
under
arrest
for
possession
of
that
pistol.
then
he
made
his
contemporaneous
search
of
the
person
which
disclosed
the
heroin
and
of
the
automobile
which
disclosed
the
machete
and
it
is
relevant
as
to
those
second
two
searches
that
they
of
course
follow
the
arrest
and
they
took
place
right
there
on
hamilton
street.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
the
machete
was
under
the
passenger
seat
of
the
front
--
the
passenger
side
of
the
automobile
and
that's
where
williams
was
sitting.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
no,
it
was
under
the
seat
--
mr.
donald
a.
browne
under
the
seat
because
only
williams
knew
it
was
there
and
nobody
else
knew
it
was
there
and
so
i
think
that
it
was
--
it's
not
illogical
to
say
that
he
still
could
have
made
an
attempt
to
pull
the
machete
out
--
mr.
donald
a.
browne
on
hamilton
street,
right
next
to
the
automobile,
on
hamilton
street.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
well,
it
of
course,
he
is
standing
right
next
to
the
automobile,
he
is
the
only
one
that
knows
that
machete
is
there.
i
still
can't
say
that
even
though
the
police
are
there,
that
it's
unreasonable
to
consider
that
he
could
still
make
an
attempt
to
get
the
machete,
it's
far
different
from
the
case
--
mr.
donald
a.
browne
what's
that?
mr.
donald
a.
browne
that's
correct
and
still
the
guy
might
get
the
machete.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
i
still
say
he
could
make
an
attempt
to
obtain
it.
i
still
--
i
would
submit
to
your
honor
--
mr.
donald
a.
browne
it
might
be
a
foolish
attempt,
but
he
is
standing
next
to
the
automobile,
he
is
not
--
mr.
donald
a.
browne
oh!
no,
not
the
search
to
disclose
the
machete,
oh!
no,
i
don't
submit
that
the
search
which
disclosed
the
machete
was
--
mr.
donald
a.
browne
that
was
a
contemporaneous
search,
contemporaneous
to
his
arrest
there
on
hamilton
street.
i
don't
make
any
claim
that
the
machete
was
disclosed
by
the
protective
search,
not
at
all.
after
the
--
as
mr.
williams
was
arrested,
a
search
was
made,
contemporaneous
incident
towards
arrest
of
this
person
and
of
the
automobile
which
disclosed
these
--
mr.
donald
a.
browne
there
is
a
considerable
description
of
testimony
in
which
he
describes
information
that
the
informant
had
given
him
before
which
did
not
lead
to
an
arrest,
but
rather
related
to
particular
criminal
activities
taking
place
at
a
particular
location
in
which
the
officer
proceeded
to
investigate.
there's
also
a
substantial
cross
examination
in
which
the
officers
inquired
of
relating
to
the
informant's
past
record
and
he
indicates
a
number
of
other
items
which
he
personally
knew
about
the
informant.
i
do
want
to
make
a
--
save
a
couple
of
minutes,
if
i
might,
for
a
rebuttal,
but
i
would
submit
in
a
nutshell,
if
i
could,
that
the
position
of
the
petitioner
in
this
particular
matter
is
that
when
you
have
put
the
officer
on
the
street
next
to
the
automobile
that
if
you
want
to
balance
of
the
intrusion
involved
against
the
possibility
of
the
violent
crime
which
could
have
occurred
right
then
and
there
which
obviously
could
have
included
up
to
his
being
mortally
wounded,
it's
the
position
of
the
petitioner
here
that,
balancing
those
two
together,
it's
not
illogical
or
unconstitutional
to
maintain
that
the
officer
was
justified
in
taking
whatever
efforts
he
did
to
protect
himself.
thank
you.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
i
would
if
i
have
time
left,
and
i
don't
know
whether
i
do
or
not.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
very
briefly
to
the
question.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
the
question
of
the
possibility
of
a
pistol
permit
appears
for
the
first
time
in
1970
when
the
matter
is
argued
to
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals.
in
other
words,
in
the
superior
court
connecticut,
in
the
connecticut
supreme
court
and
in
united
states
district
court,
counsel
for
mr.
williams
never
advanced
the
argument
which
is
being
made
here
to
you
gentlemen
this
afternoon
and
which
was
concededly
made
in
the
the
second
circuit
court,
that
being
the
possibility
that
he
might
have
had
a
permit
and
consequently
if
he
had
have
had
a
permit,
then
his
possession
of
that
pistol
might
not
have
been
a
crime.
so
consequently,
the
petitioner,
the
warden
or
the
state
or
what
have
you,
never
presented
to
any
of
the
lower
courts
any
evidence
regarding
the
frequency
with
which
pistol
permits
are
issued
by
the
superintendent
of
police
in
bridgeport.
in
other
words,
before
mr.
williams'
possession
of
the
pistol
to
have
been
legal
and
not
a
violation
of
this
particular
statue,
he
would
have
had
to
have
obtained
a
permit
from
the
superintendent
of
police
in
bridgeport.
now,
that
particular
issue
itself
was
never
framed
in
any
of
the
arguments
at
all
before
the
state
court
that
was
never
presented.
it
was
never
framed
within
the
pleadings
of
the
petition
itself
for
a
habeas
corpus.
it
was
argued
in
any
fashion
whatsoever
before
the
district
court.
so
it
took
williams
four
years
from
1966
to
1970
to
determine
that
possibly
he
might
have
had
a
permit
that
possibly
he
might
not
have
been
guilty
of
this
particular
statue
which
relates
to
carrying
a
gun
and
i
submit
that
accordingly
the
state
or
the
petitioner
here
has
never
presented
any
particular
evidence
on
that
point.
i
think
that
it
follows
also
as
to
whether
or
not
officer
connolly
was
justified
in
arresting
him
for
carrying
a
pistol
without
a
permit
that
once
he
found
out
that
the
pistol
was
there,
once
he
removed
that
pistol,
i
think
that,
that
attaches
a
tremendous
amount
of
reliability
or
credibility
to
the
balance
of
the
information
received
in
addition
to
the
the
pistol,
he
also
had
narcotics.
in
other
words
--
and
i
think
that
it's
a
fair
conclusion
that
officer
connolly
could
legitimately
reach
that
if
the
man
has
a
pistol
and
if
he
has
narcotics
that
he
doesn't
have
a
permit
to
carry
that
pistol
because
i
am
sure
the
evidence
would
have
shown
that
pistol
permits
are
not
granted
without
any
consideration
to
anybody
that
applies
for
them.
pistol
permits
are
granted
only
upon
a
substantial
causative
persons
entitled
to
have
one.
finally,
the
last
argument
that
i
would
make
about
pistol
permit
is
of
course
that
the
all
that
was
necessary
for
mr.
connolly
to
arrest
robert
williams
was
probable
cause
that
mr.
williams
had
committed
the
particular
crime
of
carrying
a
pistol
without
a
permit.
it
wasn't
necessary
that
he
proved
it
without
a
doubt.
i
think
that
again
connolly
could
have
justifiably
relied
upon
his
20
years
experience
as
a
police
officer
in
saying
that
when
he
placed
this
man
under
arrest
for
carrying
a
pistol
without
a
permit
that
if
the
man
had
in
fact
had
a
permit
he
would
have
told
him
so.
i
think
he
would
have
told
him
so
emphatically
that
you
can't
arrest
me
for
this
particular
charge,
i
do
have
a
permit
issued
by
your
superintendent
of
police.
of
course
finally
that
there
is
no
claim
at
all
that
i
can
see
that
in
fact
he
was
illegally
arrested
because
he
had
a
permit.
i
think
it's
conceded
that
he
did
not
have
one.
again,
i
submit
and
it
would
be
our
position
that
there
is
absolutely
no
indication
here
whatsoever
that
officer
connolly
knew
robert
williams
before
this
incident,
that
he
was
acting
out
of
any
desire
to
harass
williams,
that
he
was
acting
out
of
any
motive,
any
improper
motive
of
any
sort
whatsoever.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
the
arrest
for
carrying
a
pistol,
absolutely
no.
without
question,
the
subsequent
searches
have
to
stand
or
fall
under
--
mr.
donald
a.
browne
we
maintain
terry
supports,
his
seizing
that
pistol.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
step
two,
we
submit
he
is
legally
arrested
for
possession
of
a
pistol
without
a
permit
and
step
three,
we
submit
that
he
is
validly
contemporaneously
searched
incidental
to
his
arrest
which
discloses
the
heroin
and
which
discloses
the
machete
under
the
seat
and
incidentally
for
the
purpose
of
the
record
as
long
as
the
machete
is
more
than
four
inches
in
length,
it
is
a
crime
in
the
state
of
connecticut
to
carry
it.
it's
not
a
crime
to
carry
a
knife
or
the
blade
less
than
4
inches
and
they
represented
that
the
machete
was
--
mr.
donald
a.
browne
no,
i
don't
submit
that
the
informer's
tip
was
probable
cause
to
search
for
heroin,
but
i
do
make
the
claim
relative
to
the
possession
of
the
pistol
that
the
location
of
the
pistol
--
mr.
donald
a.
browne
the
search
for
the
seizure
of
the
pistol,
yes.
but
i
do
represent
that
the
information
that
he
also
had
narcotics
and
the
existence
of
the
pistol
is
substantially
collaborative
that
he
did
not
have
a
permit
for
his
pistol
on
the
claim
that
a
person
with
narcotics
would
not
have
a
permit
for
a
pistol.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
to
proceed
to
arrest
for
narcotics.
i
haven't
as
yet
obviously,
my
two
brace,
advanced
that
argument
but
--
mr.
donald
a.
browne
i
have
not
as
yet.
no,
but
i
would
submit
--
mr.
donald
a.
browne
well,
of
course
obviously
it
depends
again
as
to
whether
or
not
the
pistol
was
validly
ceased.
if
the
pistol
is
not
validly
ceased
i
think
the
collaboration
would
go
out
as
a
fruit
of
an
illegal
search
in
any
event.
but
again
--
mr.
donald
a.
browne
yes.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
well,
essentially
on
the
basis
that
there
has
been
no
showing
sufficiently
that
this
informer
himself
had
previously
presented
sufficient
information
to
make
him
a
reliable
informant
or
truly
he
doesn't
state
the
basis
of
his
knowledge,
he
doesn't
say
that
he
saw
the
narcotics
or
that
williams
told
him
he
had
the
narcotics.
the
whole
question
of
course
of
street
arrests
is
a
field
of
its
own.
i
am
not
making
any
claim
--
anything
other
than
the
law
as
set
forth
whitney
would
be
governing
the
situation.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
i
can't
speak.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
the
only
other
thing
i
would
say
is
that
i
was
a
little
surprised
this
afternoon
when
my
brother
did
make
the
claim
that
he
felt
that
it
was
improper,
illegal,
unconstitutional
whatever
you
have
for
connolly
to
walk
out
of
the
gas
station
across
hamilton
street,
in
view
of
the
statement
in
this
brief
that
the
case
law
of
recognizing
the
right
to
stop
applies
fairly
broad
standards
in
support
of
such
action,
the
right
to
execute
a
search
is
more
reasonably
defined.
so
that
this
was
the
first
time
that
he
had
claimed
to
my
knowledge
that
there
was
an
improper
activity
in
moving
out
of
the
gas
station
and
across
next
to
the
automobile
and
again
as
far
as
the
final
action
in
the
officer
in
reaching
it
and
seizing
the
pistol
i
think
that
the
one
sentence
of
the
chief
justice
in
the
terry
case
that
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
require
that
police
officers
take
unnecessary
risks
in
the
performance
of
their
duties,
was
completely
applicable
to
the
activity
of
sergeant
connolly
in
doing
what
he
did.
as
i
urged
in
my
earlier
argument,
i
think
it's
balance
of
the
intrusion
involved
as
against
the
possibility
of
a
substantial
injury
or
a
violent
crime
upon
himself,
i
think
the
election
which
he
did
was
completely
proper.
thank
you!
mr.
donald
a.
browne
thank
you,
your
honor.
so
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
evolves
from
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
which
was
filed
by
the
present
respondent,
robert
williams
in
1969
in
the
federal
district
court
in
the
district
of
connecticut.
mr.
williams
had
been
arrested
in
the
city
of
bridgeport,
connecticut
in
october,
1966.
he
had
been
charged
with
a
number
of
state
criminal
violations
relative
to
his
possession
of
a
quantity
of
heroin,
a
pistol,
and
a
machete.
in
those
state
prosecutions,
mr.
williams
had
filed
motions
to
suppress
those
items
to
prevent
them
from
being
used
as
evidence
in
his
state
trials.
these
motions
were
denied.
mr.
williams
was
subsequently
convicted.
he
took
an
appeal
to
the
state's
supreme
court
for
the
state
of
connecticut
which
affirmed
his
conviction
and
likewise
ruled
that
the
items
which
had
been
taken
from
this
possession
by
a
bridgeport
police
officer
had
not
been
taken
illegally
or
in
any
violation
of
his
constitutional
rights.
thereafter,
mr.
williams
filed
the
instant
petition
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
in
connecticut.
that
court
ruled
likewise
that
his
rights
had
not
been
violated.
they
affirmed
the
prior
decisions
of
the
connecticut
courts.
thereafter,
the
matter
was
appealed
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
initially,
that
court
again
affirmed
the
lower
court,
the
district
court
ruling
by
a
divided
court,
2
to
1
decision.
the
respondent
thereafter
petitioned
for
a
rehearing
and
a
rehearing
en
banc
was
granted
and
the
result
of
which
was
a
per
curiam
decision
which
reversed
the
lower
court's,
the
prior
court
decisions
and
ruled,
in
fact,
that
the
bridgeport
police
officer
had
no
constitutional
basis
or
no
valid
reason
for
removing
certain
items
from
mr.
williams'
possession.
i
think
that
factually
the
facts
are
not
in
great
detail.
it
is
a
relatively
simple
factual
situation,
in
that
on
the
early
morning
of
october
20,
1966,
a
bridgeport
police
sergeant
by
the
name
of
john
connolly
who
was
veteran
of
20
years
service
on
the
bridgeport
police
department
was
on
petrol
duty
alone
in
the
city
of
bridgeport
in
a
particular
area
of
the
city
which
was
noted
for
a
high
incidents
of
crime.
at
that
time
he
was
in
a
gasoline
station
at
the
intersection
of
two
public
streets
in
the
city.
he
met
and
he
had
a
conversation
with
a
person
whom
he
knew,
who
was
known
to
him,
that
particular
person
indicated
to
him
that
there
was
another
person
seated
in
an
automobile
nearby
in
a
street
known
as
hamilton
street
and
that
that
person,
who
incidentally
developed
to
be
the
respondent
robert
williams,
that
he
had
drugs
and
then
he
had
a
pistol
in
his
waistband.
thereafter,
the
officer
proceeded
out
of
the
gasoline
station
across
the
street
of
hamilton
street
to
the
particular
automobile.
he
knocked
on
the
window
of
the
car,
he
asked
the
respondent
to
open
the
car
door.
in
response
thereto
mr.
williams
rolled
down
the
automobile
window
on
the
passenger
side.
the
officer
immediately
placed
one
hand
in
through
the
open
car
window
inside
of
the
respondent's
coat
which
was
open
and
directly
on
to
the
handle
of
a
pistol,
which
he
seized
and
removed
from
the
respondent.
apparently,
the
coat
was
open,
he
apparently
didn't
touch
mr.
williams'
body
at
all
other
than
inside
of
his
coat.
the
revolver
was
fully
loaded.
he
then
proceeded
to
place
mr.
williams
under
arrest,
advised
him
of
his
constitutional
rights
relative
to
statements.
then
a
further
search
was
conducted
of
the
person
of
mr.
williams
which
disclosed
a
quantity
of
heroin,
at
two
locations
on
his
person
and
a
search
was
conducted
of
the
automobile
there
on
hamilton
street
which
disclosed
a
large
machete
concealed
under
the
passenger
seat
where
mr.
williams
had
been
seated.
as
i
indicated
earlier,
there
were
motions
made
within
the
state
courts
to
suppress
these
items
as
evidence.
there
is
no
dispute
that
they
were
timely
made,
they
were
overruled,
the
matter
was
affirmed
by
the
connecticut
supreme
court
and
the
united
states
district
court
reversed
in
per
curium
opinion
from
which
my
client,
the
warden
into
actuality
of
the
state
of
connecticut
petition
for
certiorari
which
was
granted.
the
state,
the
warden
petitioner
in
the
various
courts
in
which
this
has
been
presented
has
tried
to
urge
that
the
issues
here
to
be
framed
in
the
dual
consideration
which
is
presented
within
the
decision
of
the
terry
case,
more
particularly
at
page
20
of
the
terry
case.
i
think
it
goes
without
saying
that,
it's
the
position
of
the
petitioner
that
many
statements
contained
within
the
decision
of
terry
versus
united
states
both
within
the
majority
decision
and
the
concurring
decision
are
uniquely
applicable
to
the
factual
situations
in
the
case
of
robert
williams.
in
the
terry
decision,
at
page
20
of
the
reported
decision,
the
chief
justice
urges
that
a
dual
consideration
must
be
inquired
into
when
determining
in
this
type
of
a
situation,
where
a
officer
making
a
self-protection
search
and
the
first
consideration
is
whether
the
officer's
actions
were
justified
at
their
inception
and
second
consideration
is
whether
the
activities
or
actions
were
related
reasonably
in
scope
to
the
circumstances
which
justify
the
interference.
and
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
the
actions
of
the
officer,
officer
john
connolly
in
leaving
the
gasoline
station
after
he
received
this
particular
information,
which
is
i
indicated,
was
from
a
person
who
he
knew
by
name
and
who
he
had
had
prior
conversations
with
and
whom
he
believed
to
be
a
person
who
was
trustworthy
and
reliable.
that
his
actions
in
leaving
the
gas
station
on
the
basis
of
that
information
in
going
over
to
the
automobile
to
make
the
investigation,
a
further
investigation
were
completely
justified.
i
would
point
out
that
in
most
of
the
reported
cases,
i
think
that
most
of
the
cases
that
i
have
read
which
relate
to
street
investigations
in
which
an
officer
receives
information
and
then
proceeds
to
make
some
sort
of
an
investigation.
i
think
the
great
majority
of
those
cases
involve
situations
where
the
officer
receives
his
information
from
someone
who
is
unknown
to
him,
from
a
person
who
comes
up
to
him
and
relates
to
him
that
some
unusual
activity
or
some
type
of
criminality
is
taking
place
and
then
he
makes
his
decision
to
proceed
or
not
proceed
or
whatever
he
is
going
to
do.
but
i
think
it's
of
considerable
importance
here
that
that
was
not
the
situation
here.
this
is
not
the
situation
where
a
person
who
was
stranger
to
an
officer
comes
up
and
indicates
information
to
him
on
basis
of
which
he
makes
his
investigation.
i
think,
is
relevant,
because
in
the
case
of
an
unknown
or
unnamed
individual,
the
individual
after
giving
the
information
can
go
about
his
ways
and
quite
possibly
never
be
located
by
the
officer
again,
whereas
this
is
not
the
situation.
here
the
officer
knew
this
individual
and
knew
him
my
name
and
of
course
if
the
information
had
been
incorrect,
he
could
come
back
and
locate
that
person
additionally
and
inquire
as
to
why
it
had
been
made
to
him.
the
officer
arrives
at
the
side
of
the
car
in
which
mr.
williams
was
seated,
the
window
was
lowered
and
i
think
that
then
he
had
to
make
the
decision,
which
in
all
probability
is
the
crux
of
this
particular
case,
and
that
is
whether
or
not
he
was
justified
in
reaching
his
hand
in
through
the
open
window
and
into
the
waist
of
the
respondent
where
he
found
and
came
in
contact
with
the
handle
of
the
revolver
and
removed
it.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
yes,
that
appears
in
several
places
within
the
appendix,
within
his
testimony.
i
don't
have
the
pages
right
in
front
of
me,
but
it
does
appear
within
the
appendix
on
several
occasions
that
the
coat
was
open;
it
was
not
buttoned.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
yes,
he
was
justice
--
mr.
donald
a.
browne
he
received
a
sentence
on
the
possession
of
the
heroin
of
not
less
than
three
and
not
more
than
six
years
in
state's
prison.
he
received
one
year
sentence
which
was
consecutive
on
the
possession
of
the
pistol
without
a
permit
and
additional
one
year
sentence
on
the
possession
of
the
machete,
both
of
which
are
added
to
the
maximum
sentence
of
the
state
of
connecticut.
so
his
effective
sentence
was
not
less
than
three
and
not
more
than
eight
years
on
all
of
the
charges,
that
was
total
sentence.
again,
it's
the
position
of
the
petitioner
here
that
the
crux
of
the
case
amounts
or
evolves
to
whether
or
not
the
particular
officer
was
justified
reaching
into
the
automobile
and
placing
his
hand
on
the
handle
of
the
revolver
and
removing
it,
and
again
we
would
submit
that
it
was
a
decision
which
the
great
majority
of
trained
police
officers
in
that
circumstances
at
that
time
would
undoubtedly
have
done.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
no
i
do
not
--
mr.
donald
a.
browne
no,
we
have
never
contested
that.
we
have
never
contested
the
availability
of
that
particular
one.
i
would
remark
that
this
proceeding
today
is
the
seventh
time
in
which
this
particular
point
has
been
judicially
reviewed
by
a
court
or
courts.
in
other
words,
it
was
reviewed
three
times
within
the
state
system.
it
was
reviewed
prior
to
today,
three
times
in
the
federal
system
and
today
it
makes
the
seventh
time
within
which
it
has
been
further
reviewed
judicially.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
twice
by
the
second
court
of
appeals
for
second
circuit
and
today
it
makes
the
fourth
time.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
that's
correct,
into
the
car
and
into
his
waistband.
in
other
words,
he
reached
in
--
mr.
donald
a.
browne
into
the
waistband,
that's
correct.
now
again
quite
clearly
--
mr.
donald
a.
browne
williams
rolled
the
window
down.
so
window
wasn't
--
mr.
donald
a.
browne
he
was
asked
to
open
the
door,
and
he
in
response
rolled
the
window
down
and
the
officer
then
placed
his
car
--
his
hand
into
the
automobile
and
right
on
to
the
handle
of
the
revolver.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
i
assume
that
the
--
no,
i
assume
that
the
implication
of
the
per
curiam
sentence
is
that
there
was
no
sufficient
cause
to
reach
into
the
automobile
or
into
the
waistband.
i
think
it's
a
corollary
that
if
he
had
no
cause
to
reaching
to
the
waistband,
probably
he
didn't
have
any
cause
to
reach
into
the
car.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
well,
unfortunately
that's
the
reason
i
have
tried
to
framed
the
issues
in
the
way
that
i
have.
unfortunately,
in
the
one
or
two
sentence,
the
decision
by
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals,
they
did
not
indicate
within
that
decision
just
whether
they
were
saying
that
there
was
no
probable
cause
for
him
to
investigate
further,
whether
there
was
no
probable
cause
for
him
to
or
sufficient
cause
i
should
say,
for
him
to
leave
the
gasoline
station
and
go
over
to
the
automobile
or
whether
they
were
merely
saying
that
you
may
have
been
justified
in
going
over
to
the
automobile,
but
in
any
event
there
was
no
sufficient
cause
for
him
to
reach
in
and
remove
the
pistol.
i
think
that
it's
difficult
because
of
the
way
they
framed
their
opinion.
they
don't
say
necessarily
whether
they
are
including
the
fact
that
this
investigation
was
improper,
although
i
feel
and
my
brother
may
correct
me,
he
at
least
in
his
brief,
that
is
not
briefed
to
my
knowledge
any
claim
that
it
was
improper
or
imprudent
by
the
officer
to
make
this
investigation
in
the
manner
that
he
did.
i
think
the
claim
is
that
once
he
got
to
the
automobile,
he
should
not
have
inserted
his
hand
in
the
window.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
i
don't
think
that
--
my
recollection
of
the
opinion
of
justice
--
his
dissenting
opinion.
i
don't
think
he
ever
comes
out
and
says
categorically
that
connolly
should
never
have
left
the
gasoline
station
and
gone
over
to
the
respondent.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
my
recollection
of
the
dissent
of
judge
friendly
was
he
held
that
there
was
not
a
sufficient
basis
for
a
stop.
now
where
the
stop
was,
whether
the
stop
was,
actually
obviously
he
didn't
stop
mr.
williams
from
proceeding
in
any
manner,
because
mr.
william
wasn't
proceeding
any
place,
he
was
just
sitting
there.
so
there
wasn't
a
stop
in
the
idea
that
he
stopped
his
momentum
or
he
stopped
his
walking
or
he
stopped
his
activity.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
whether
he
is
justified
first
in
approaching
the
car?
obviously,
if
he
wasn't
approaching
--
mr.
donald
a.
browne
well,
that
would
be
my
position.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
and
again
i
have
taken
that
into
and
tried
to
frame
it
in
two
particular
issues
as
i
indicated
under
the
law
as
set
forth
in
the
terry.
one,
whether
he
was
justified
in
leaving
the
gasoline
station
and
walking
across
the
hamilton
street
to
the
automobile.
and
then
two,
once
you
put
him
next
to
the
automobile
and
the
window
goes
down,
is
he
secondarily
justified
in
reaching
in
to
remove
the
individual's
gun.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
well,
the
appendix
--
i
think
the
testimony
of
the
officer
is
clear
that
he
received
the
tip
in
the
gasoline
station.
now
there
was
a
hearing
by
judge
clary
in
united
states
district
court
to
clear
up
what
he
considered
to
be
a
discrepancy
between
the
officer's
earlier
testimony
and
the
officer's
testimony
in
the
superior
court
motion
to
suppress
at
the
trial
and
there
was
a
hearing
for
that
specific
purpose
and
the
conclusion
of
which
in
his
memorandum
of
the
decision,
the
judge
expressly
accepts
and
finds
the
finding
of
the
superior
court
to
be
completely
correct
and
he
adopts
them
as
the
findings
of
the
united
states
district
court.
so
i
don't
think
that
as
far
as
this
court
is
concerned,
there
is
any
question.
at
this
time
what
that
he
did
receive
that
information
in
the
gasoline
station
in
the
manner
in
which
he
testified
and
acted
accordingly.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
yes,
sir.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
no
question
about
it.
in
the
case
of
officer
connolly,
i
happen
to
know
that
he
has
since
retired.
he
is
no
longer
a
member
of
bridgeport
police
department.
so
it
will
have
no
effect
on
officer
connolly
obviously.
the
effect
that
it's
going
to
have
on
other
brother
police
officers,
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
is
going
to
deter
them
for
making
any
investigation
in
the
streets
when
they
receive
information
unless
they
can
categorically
substantiate
--
a
feeling
that
they
can
categorically
substantiate
that
they
are
not
going
to
be
criticized
or
that
any
evidence
which
their
investigation
discloses
is
not
going
to
be
ruled
or
suppressed
as
evidence
in
the
subsequent
proceedings.
if
anything
i
think
it's
going
to
substantially
deter
proper
police
protection.
i
would,
and
i
hesitate,
but
i
would
state
that
the
supreme
court
for
the
state
of
connecticut
rather
than
indicating
or
making
any
claim
that
officer
connolly
acted
with
insolence
or
acted
imprudently,
they
went
out
of
their
way
to
indicate
they
felt
he
was
a
brave
man,
that
he
displayed
a
degree
of
courage
in
going
over
to
the
particular
automobile
even
though
he
felt
that
there
was
an
individual
in
there
with
a
pistol
which
obviously
could
have
been
be
used
against
him,
and
i
don't
think
there
has
ever
been
any
claim
made
by
the
respondent
himself
that
officer
connolly
acted
imprudently
that
he
acted
--
mr.
donald
a.
browne
well,
i
can't
read
necessarily
that
your
honor's
conclusion
into
that
particular
decision,
but
i
think
that
--
i
think
terry
clearly
points
out
in
a
number
of
locations
that
one,
that
there
is
no
prohibition
against
the
officer
for
example
from
walking
--
from
stopping
a
person
on
the
street
and
asking
him
a
questions,
that
is
i
don't
think
that
a
big
deal.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
yes.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
it
would
be
covered
a
number
of
the
general
phrases
contained
within
the
terry
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
the
officer
is
acting
as
a
reasonably
prudent
person
under
all
of
the
circumstance.
obviously,
we
get
to
the
distinction
which
is
the
distinction
my
brother
urges
upon
the
court
and
that
is
between
some
time
of
a
movement
which
is
observed
by
the
officer
himself
or
whether
he
can
justify
a
protective
search
exclusively
on
the
basis
of
the
information
which
he
receives.
and
that
i
think
is
my
brother's
argument
and
his
claim
and
at
least
as
i
read
his
brief
is
that
in
order
for
any
police
officer
to
justify
a
protective
search,
a
self-protective
search,
he
must
be
able
to
point
to
some
matter
which
he
has
personally
observed
himself
which
indicates,
makes
him
feel
that
his
position
is
in
peril
and
that
justifies
him
to
go
ahead
and
make
this
particular
search.
i
think
he
urges
that
no
matter
how
strong
the
authenticity
of
the
information
which
is
received
that
a
police
officer
just
cannot
--
mr.
donald
a.
browne
i
cannot,
i
cannot
--
mr.
donald
a.
browne
no,
i
cannot
submit
to
your
honor
any
grave
justification
or
a
distinction
between
the
fact
that
he
was
standing
on
the
street
corner
or
the
fact
that
he
was
sitting
in
the
automobile
other
than
the
fact
that
being
in
the
automobile
it
might
have
been
considerably
more
difficult
for
connolly
to
observe
furtive
movement
such
as
a
moment
to
go
for
as
his
gun.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
i
would
assume
on
a
basis
of
judge
friendly
--
mr.
donald
a.
browne
i
can
only
submit
that
if
the
informant
had
said
i
saw
the
gun
there,
then
quite
possibly
the
officer
connolly
may
have
basis
to
go
over
and
make
an
arrest
--
mr.
donald
a.
browne
i
think,
i
submit
that
he
would
have,
i
submit
that
he
would
have.
if
the
informant
had
only
added
that
one
more
piece
of
information
that
“i
saw
the
gun,”
then
i
think
that
we
wouldn't
be
here
on
the
question
of
stop
and
frisk
or
a
protective
search.
i
think,
officer
connolly
would
have
had
simple
probable
cause
to
go
over
and
make
an
arrest
of
williams
without
regard
--
mr.
donald
a.
browne
well,
i
submit
that
--
are
you
including
the
fact
that
he
indicated
that
he
saw
the
gun
or
are
you
excluding
that?
mr.
donald
a.
browne
precisely
the
--
mr.
donald
a.
browne
well
that
of
course,
it
relates
again
to
the
propriety
of
an
investigation,
obviously
he
wouldn't
have
had
probable
course
for
an
arrest
in
those
--
we
really
even
know
that
he
knew
mr.
williams'
name
--
mr.
donald
a.
browne
that's
right,
that's
correct.
if
there
would
have
been
like
substantially
more
collaboration
of
the
information
that
he
had
received,
the
existence
of
a
man
in
an
automobile
out
at
hamilton
street
at
that
particular
time
would
have
been
collaborative
of
the
information
supplied
by
the
reporting
witness
to
him
(inaudible)
things.
as
i
understand
again,
finally
my
brother's
position,
it
would
be
that
no
matter
how
authentic
the
information
received
if
the
informant
had
been
a
judge
or
the
informant
had
been
three
or
four
judges,
still
unless
officer
connolly
personally
observed
something
in
the
nature
of
a
furtive
movement
or
furtive
action,
he
still
couldn't
proceed
and
to
proceed,
it
would
be
illogical
or
unreasonable
for
him
to
fear
that
his
life
was
in
peril
and
consequently
it
would
have
been
illogical
for
him
to
make
the
protective
search
at
that
particular
time.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
no,
the
search
of
the
automobile
itself
hinges
upon
obviously
whether
or
not
the
disclosure
of
the
pistol
supplied
sufficient
probable
cause
for
him
to
place
him
under
arrest.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
after
he
found
the
pistol,
he
proceeded
to
place
him
under
arrest
for
possession
of
that
pistol.
then
he
made
his
contemporaneous
search
of
the
person
which
disclosed
the
heroin
and
of
the
automobile
which
disclosed
the
machete
and
it
is
relevant
as
to
those
second
two
searches
that
they
of
course
follow
the
arrest
and
they
took
place
right
there
on
hamilton
street.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
the
machete
was
under
the
passenger
seat
of
the
front
--
the
passenger
side
of
the
automobile
and
that's
where
williams
was
sitting.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
no,
it
was
under
the
seat
--
mr.
donald
a.
browne
under
the
seat
because
only
williams
knew
it
was
there
and
nobody
else
knew
it
was
there
and
so
i
think
that
it
was
--
it's
not
illogical
to
say
that
he
still
could
have
made
an
attempt
to
pull
the
machete
out
--
mr.
donald
a.
browne
on
hamilton
street,
right
next
to
the
automobile,
on
hamilton
street.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
well,
it
of
course,
he
is
standing
right
next
to
the
automobile,
he
is
the
only
one
that
knows
that
machete
is
there.
i
still
can't
say
that
even
though
the
police
are
there,
that
it's
unreasonable
to
consider
that
he
could
still
make
an
attempt
to
get
the
machete,
it's
far
different
from
the
case
--
mr.
donald
a.
browne
what's
that?
mr.
donald
a.
browne
that's
correct
and
still
the
guy
might
get
the
machete.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
i
still
say
he
could
make
an
attempt
to
obtain
it.
i
still
--
i
would
submit
to
your
honor
--
mr.
donald
a.
browne
it
might
be
a
foolish
attempt,
but
he
is
standing
next
to
the
automobile,
he
is
not
--
mr.
donald
a.
browne
oh!
no,
not
the
search
to
disclose
the
machete,
oh!
no,
i
don't
submit
that
the
search
which
disclosed
the
machete
was
--
mr.
donald
a.
browne
that
was
a
contemporaneous
search,
contemporaneous
to
his
arrest
there
on
hamilton
street.
i
don't
make
any
claim
that
the
machete
was
disclosed
by
the
protective
search,
not
at
all.
after
the
--
as
mr.
williams
was
arrested,
a
search
was
made,
contemporaneous
incident
towards
arrest
of
this
person
and
of
the
automobile
which
disclosed
these
--
mr.
donald
a.
browne
there
is
a
considerable
description
of
testimony
in
which
he
describes
information
that
the
informant
had
given
him
before
which
did
not
lead
to
an
arrest,
but
rather
related
to
particular
criminal
activities
taking
place
at
a
particular
location
in
which
the
officer
proceeded
to
investigate.
there's
also
a
substantial
cross
examination
in
which
the
officers
inquired
of
relating
to
the
informant's
past
record
and
he
indicates
a
number
of
other
items
which
he
personally
knew
about
the
informant.
i
do
want
to
make
a
--
save
a
couple
of
minutes,
if
i
might,
for
a
rebuttal,
but
i
would
submit
in
a
nutshell,
if
i
could,
that
the
position
of
the
petitioner
in
this
particular
matter
is
that
when
you
have
put
the
officer
on
the
street
next
to
the
automobile
that
if
you
want
to
balance
of
the
intrusion
involved
against
the
possibility
of
the
violent
crime
which
could
have
occurred
right
then
and
there
which
obviously
could
have
included
up
to
his
being
mortally
wounded,
it's
the
position
of
the
petitioner
here
that,
balancing
those
two
together,
it's
not
illogical
or
unconstitutional
to
maintain
that
the
officer
was
justified
in
taking
whatever
efforts
he
did
to
protect
himself.
thank
you.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
i
would
if
i
have
time
left,
and
i
don't
know
whether
i
do
or
not.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
very
briefly
to
the
question.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
the
question
of
the
possibility
of
a
pistol
permit
appears
for
the
first
time
in
1970
when
the
matter
is
argued
to
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals.
in
other
words,
in
the
superior
court
connecticut,
in
the
connecticut
supreme
court
and
in
united
states
district
court,
counsel
for
mr.
williams
never
advanced
the
argument
which
is
being
made
here
to
you
gentlemen
this
afternoon
and
which
was
concededly
made
in
the
the
second
circuit
court,
that
being
the
possibility
that
he
might
have
had
a
permit
and
consequently
if
he
had
have
had
a
permit,
then
his
possession
of
that
pistol
might
not
have
been
a
crime.
so
consequently,
the
petitioner,
the
warden
or
the
state
or
what
have
you,
never
presented
to
any
of
the
lower
courts
any
evidence
regarding
the
frequency
with
which
pistol
permits
are
issued
by
the
superintendent
of
police
in
bridgeport.
in
other
words,
before
mr.
williams'
possession
of
the
pistol
to
have
been
legal
and
not
a
violation
of
this
particular
statue,
he
would
have
had
to
have
obtained
a
permit
from
the
superintendent
of
police
in
bridgeport.
now,
that
particular
issue
itself
was
never
framed
in
any
of
the
arguments
at
all
before
the
state
court
that
was
never
presented.
it
was
never
framed
within
the
pleadings
of
the
petition
itself
for
a
habeas
corpus.
it
was
argued
in
any
fashion
whatsoever
before
the
district
court.
so
it
took
williams
four
years
from
1966
to
1970
to
determine
that
possibly
he
might
have
had
a
permit
that
possibly
he
might
not
have
been
guilty
of
this
particular
statue
which
relates
to
carrying
a
gun
and
i
submit
that
accordingly
the
state
or
the
petitioner
here
has
never
presented
any
particular
evidence
on
that
point.
i
think
that
it
follows
also
as
to
whether
or
not
officer
connolly
was
justified
in
arresting
him
for
carrying
a
pistol
without
a
permit
that
once
he
found
out
that
the
pistol
was
there,
once
he
removed
that
pistol,
i
think
that,
that
attaches
a
tremendous
amount
of
reliability
or
credibility
to
the
balance
of
the
information
received
in
addition
to
the
the
pistol,
he
also
had
narcotics.
in
other
words
--
and
i
think
that
it's
a
fair
conclusion
that
officer
connolly
could
legitimately
reach
that
if
the
man
has
a
pistol
and
if
he
has
narcotics
that
he
doesn't
have
a
permit
to
carry
that
pistol
because
i
am
sure
the
evidence
would
have
shown
that
pistol
permits
are
not
granted
without
any
consideration
to
anybody
that
applies
for
them.
pistol
permits
are
granted
only
upon
a
substantial
causative
persons
entitled
to
have
one.
finally,
the
last
argument
that
i
would
make
about
pistol
permit
is
of
course
that
the
all
that
was
necessary
for
mr.
connolly
to
arrest
robert
williams
was
probable
cause
that
mr.
williams
had
committed
the
particular
crime
of
carrying
a
pistol
without
a
permit.
it
wasn't
necessary
that
he
proved
it
without
a
doubt.
i
think
that
again
connolly
could
have
justifiably
relied
upon
his
20
years
experience
as
a
police
officer
in
saying
that
when
he
placed
this
man
under
arrest
for
carrying
a
pistol
without
a
permit
that
if
the
man
had
in
fact
had
a
permit
he
would
have
told
him
so.
i
think
he
would
have
told
him
so
emphatically
that
you
can't
arrest
me
for
this
particular
charge,
i
do
have
a
permit
issued
by
your
superintendent
of
police.
of
course
finally
that
there
is
no
claim
at
all
that
i
can
see
that
in
fact
he
was
illegally
arrested
because
he
had
a
permit.
i
think
it's
conceded
that
he
did
not
have
one.
again,
i
submit
and
it
would
be
our
position
that
there
is
absolutely
no
indication
here
whatsoever
that
officer
connolly
knew
robert
williams
before
this
incident,
that
he
was
acting
out
of
any
desire
to
harass
williams,
that
he
was
acting
out
of
any
motive,
any
improper
motive
of
any
sort
whatsoever.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
the
arrest
for
carrying
a
pistol,
absolutely
no.
without
question,
the
subsequent
searches
have
to
stand
or
fall
under
--
mr.
donald
a.
browne
we
maintain
terry
supports,
his
seizing
that
pistol.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
step
two,
we
submit
he
is
legally
arrested
for
possession
of
a
pistol
without
a
permit
and
step
three,
we
submit
that
he
is
validly
contemporaneously
searched
incidental
to
his
arrest
which
discloses
the
heroin
and
which
discloses
the
machete
under
the
seat
and
incidentally
for
the
purpose
of
the
record
as
long
as
the
machete
is
more
than
four
inches
in
length,
it
is
a
crime
in
the
state
of
connecticut
to
carry
it.
it's
not
a
crime
to
carry
a
knife
or
the
blade
less
than
4
inches
and
they
represented
that
the
machete
was
--
mr.
donald
a.
browne
no,
i
don't
submit
that
the
informer's
tip
was
probable
cause
to
search
for
heroin,
but
i
do
make
the
claim
relative
to
the
possession
of
the
pistol
that
the
location
of
the
pistol
--
mr.
donald
a.
browne
the
search
for
the
seizure
of
the
pistol,
yes.
but
i
do
represent
that
the
information
that
he
also
had
narcotics
and
the
existence
of
the
pistol
is
substantially
collaborative
that
he
did
not
have
a
permit
for
his
pistol
on
the
claim
that
a
person
with
narcotics
would
not
have
a
permit
for
a
pistol.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
to
proceed
to
arrest
for
narcotics.
i
haven't
as
yet
obviously,
my
two
brace,
advanced
that
argument
but
--
mr.
donald
a.
browne
i
have
not
as
yet.
no,
but
i
would
submit
--
mr.
donald
a.
browne
well,
of
course
obviously
it
depends
again
as
to
whether
or
not
the
pistol
was
validly
ceased.
if
the
pistol
is
not
validly
ceased
i
think
the
collaboration
would
go
out
as
a
fruit
of
an
illegal
search
in
any
event.
but
again
--
mr.
donald
a.
browne
yes.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
well,
essentially
on
the
basis
that
there
has
been
no
showing
sufficiently
that
this
informer
himself
had
previously
presented
sufficient
information
to
make
him
a
reliable
informant
or
truly
he
doesn't
state
the
basis
of
his
knowledge,
he
doesn't
say
that
he
saw
the
narcotics
or
that
williams
told
him
he
had
the
narcotics.
the
whole
question
of
course
of
street
arrests
is
a
field
of
its
own.
i
am
not
making
any
claim
--
anything
other
than
the
law
as
set
forth
whitney
would
be
governing
the
situation.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
i
can't
speak.
mr.
donald
a.
browne
the
only
other
thing
i
would
say
is
that
i
was
a
little
surprised
this
afternoon
when
my
brother
did
make
the
claim
that
he
felt
that
it
was
improper,
illegal,
unconstitutional
whatever
you
have
for
connolly
to
walk
out
of
the
gas
station
across
hamilton
street,
in
view
of
the
statement
in
this
brief
that
the
case
law
of
recognizing
the
right
to
stop
applies
fairly
broad
standards
in
support
of
such
action,
the
right
to
execute
a
search
is
more
reasonably
defined.
so
that
this
was
the
first
time
that
he
had
claimed
to
my
knowledge
that
there
was
an
improper
activity
in
moving
out
of
the
gas
station
and
across
next
to
the
automobile
and
again
as
far
as
the
final
action
in
the
officer
in
reaching
it
and
seizing
the
pistol
i
think
that
the
one
sentence
of
the
chief
justice
in
the
terry
case
that
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
require
that
police
officers
take
unnecessary
risks
in
the
performance
of
their
duties,
was
completely
applicable
to
the
activity
of
sergeant
connolly
in
doing
what
he
did.
as
i
urged
in
my
earlier
argument,
i
think
it's
balance
of
the
intrusion
involved
as
against
the
possibility
of
a
substantial
injury
or
a
violent
crime
upon
himself,
i
think
the
election
which
he
did
was
completely
proper.
thank
you!
