justice
thurgood
marshall
the
search
at
all
wasn't
a
protective
search?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
you
said,
he
did
place
him
under
arrest?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
was
he
when
the
cop
searched
the
car?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
how
was
he
go
and
get
the
machete
standing
out
on
the
street?
justice
thurgood
marshall
at
that
stage,
the
policeman
has
got
two
guns.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
policeman
now
has
two
guns
in
his
hands?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
he
was
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
know
i
seriously
say
that,
that
was
a
search
to
protect
the
life?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
was
the
basis
of
the
search
of
the
the
car?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
about
this
informant
except
that
he
knew
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
you
find
a
man
with
a
gun
on
the
street
in
hartford,
connecticut
and
you
take
the
gun
out
of
his
belt,
what
do
you
do?
what
does
the
policeman
do
at
that
stage?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
would
you
suggest
they
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
see
a
man
walking
on
the
street
with
coat
hanging
wide
open
and
a
45
stuck
down
in
there
and
the
policeman
walks
up
and
says,
do
you
have
a
permit,
the
guy
says
nothing,
what
can
the
police
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
do
you
think
a
policeman
should
do
at
that
point?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
do
you
think
they
should
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
did
they
do
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
a
man
has
a
loaded
revolver,
and
the
policeman
is
supposed
to
hold
him,
but
he
can't
take
the
gun
away
from
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
you
meant
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
could
detain
him,
you
admit
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
asked
what
would
you
suggest
they
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now
let's
try
it
again.
justice
thurgood
marshall
under
the
constitution
what
would
you
suggest
is
the
most
that
the
policeman
could
do
looking
at
a
loaded
45
in
a
man's
trousers?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
the
man
doesn't
say
anything
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
terry
isn't
--
wasn't
--
the
officer
in
terry
was
a
man
of
some
40
odd
years
of
police
experience
in
that
type
of
work
in
that
area?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
i
do
not
think
terry
is
limited
to
that
at
all,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that
wasn't
his
business.
his
business
was
to
protecting
the
store,
the
department
store?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
would
not
try
to
get
particular.
i
think
that
the
terry
case
says
that
when
an
officer
has
reasonable
ground
to
believe
that
a
crime
is
about
to
be
committed
and
on
the
basis
of
that,
goes
up
to
question,
when
he
gets
there,
he
feels
his
life
is
in
danger,
he
has
a
right
to
cuff
them.
now
in
terry,
there
were
three
or
four
guys
standing
there,
and
each
one
of
them
was
twice
as
large
as
the
detective.
so
i
think
that
is
terry.
now,
it
seems
to
me
in
your
case,
if
the
informant's
information
was
equivalent
to
what
the
police
detective
in
terry
had,
he
had
a
right
to
go
there
and
pat
him
down.
so
your
point,
it
seems
to
me
is
whether
the
informant's
information
was
equivalent
to
what
the
detective
saw
in
terry.
isn't
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
did
you
say
that
this
was
a
reliable
informer,
that
he
would
have
given
this
man
or
some
other
policemen
six
different
pieces
of
good
information
which
rely
in
six
criminal
convictions
that
that
would
give
him
the
same
rights
that
the
detective
in
terry
did.
would
you
go
that
far?
justice
thurgood
marshall
judge
friendly
said
there
is
a
difference
between
expert
on
homosexuality

expert
on

you
agree?
justice
thurgood

the
search
at
all
wasn't

justice
thurgood

i
