--
in
number
70-283,
adams
against
williams.
mr.
browne
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
the
officer
testify
that
the
man's
coat
was
open?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
it
goes
beyond
that
and
suggest
that
there
was
no
probable
cause
to
go
over
and
tap
on
the
window?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
clear
in
your
view
that
he
received
the
information,
or
i
will
put
it
this
way,
where
do
you
say
this
record
shows
the
police
officer
received
the
tip?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
hennessey.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
hennessey
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
gold
clubs
or
anything
of
that
might
be
perfectly,
it's
as
innocent
as
a
golf
club?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
ask
you
this
hypothetical
question.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
in
exactly
the
circumstances
of
the
information
that
came
to
the
officer
in
this
case
except
that
the
automobile
is
removed
one
block
away
so
it's
out
of
the
sight,
the
tip
is
exactly
the
same.
now
the
policeman
goes
around
the
corner
and
down
and
finds
the
car,
but
instead
of
finding
the
driver
in
the
driver's
seat
he
finds
him
crouched
behind
the
car
aiming
the
pistol
over
the
hood
or
some
part
of
the
car,
do
you
think
he
could
do
anything?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
what?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
no
just
pointing
a
gun
at
somewhere
not
at
the
policeman?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
alright,
let's
take
it
back
there.
now
he
goes
up
to
the
man
and
taps
him
on
the
shoulder
and
says,
“excuse
me,
what
are
you
doing
with
that
gun?”
the
man
says,
“i
am
defending
myself,
there
is
a
man
around
the
corner
trying
to
shoot
me”.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
your
theory
of
the
immunity
of
gun
carriers
in
connecticut,
could
he
do
anymore
to
that
man
than
he
could
to
the
man
sitting
in
the
car?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
my
hypothetical
included
an
assumption
that
he
answered,
i
will
add
justice
brennan's,
here
is
my
pistol
license
and
i
am
exercising
my
right
of
self-defense,
there
is
a
man
over
here
out
of
sight
who
is
going
to
attack
me?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
as
you
say
connecticut
lets
him
carry
a
gun
for
self-defense,
why
should
the
officer
disbelieve
him,
it
might
be
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yeah.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
connecticut
lets
people
carry
gun
so
freely,
for
their
own
defense
what's
so
bad
about
doing
what
i
suggest
in
the
hypothetical
question?
(voice
overlap)
to
frighten
people
or
to
use
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
the
informant
at
the
filling
station
had
said
to
the
officer,
there
is
a
car
over
there
and
i
think
there
is
a
hold
up
at
that
bank
going
on,
but
watch
out
because
he
has
got
a
gun
in
his
belt
and
when
the
officer
approached
the
car,
the
engine
was
running.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
your
position
about
his
--
scope
of
the
officer's
duties
and
powers
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
investigate
further
is
by
doing
what?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
tap
on
--
could
he
tap
on
the
window?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
should
he
wait
till
to
see
if
the
bank
robbery
is
really
completed
and
then
try
to
have
a
shootout
as
they
come
out
of
the
bank
to
the
getaway
car?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let
us
accept
that,
that
every
officer
would
not
act
the
same
way
but
has
not
this
court,
and
other
courts
as
well
said
many
occasions
that
the
conduct
of
the
police
officer
must
be
judged
ultimately
as
it
was
seen
through
the
eyes
of
an
experienced,
prudent
police
officer
at
the
time
and
place
and
in
all
the
circumstances?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don't
think
that
the
motor
of
the
car
running
adds
any
dimension
that
will
alter
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
we
can
redetermine
the
credibility
issue
in
the
case
here
or
are
we
bound
by
the
fact
determination
made
in
connecticut
and
endorsed
by
the
highest
court
of
connecticut?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
may
answer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
now
when
we
come
to
trying
to
evaluate
what
is
the
law
of
connecticut
under
the
statute
that
you
have
been
arguing
namely
that
he
can
lawfully
sit
there
2:30
in
the
morning
with
a
loaded
gun
in
his
belt
is
not
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
connecticut,
the
state
law
binding
on
this
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
hennessey.
mr.
browne
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
say
we
will
enlarge
your
time
three
minutes
to
conform
with
the
additional
time,
so
you
got
time
enough?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
