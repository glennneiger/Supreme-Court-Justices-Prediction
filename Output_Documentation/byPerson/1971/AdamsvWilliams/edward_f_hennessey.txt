mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
only
additional
facts
which
i
would
add
in
order
to
give
some
clarification
to
the
situation
as
it
existed
in
1966
when
officer
connolly
met
this
informant,
was
that
after
officer
connolly
received
the
information,
at
that
juncture
officer
connolly
had
a
certain
set
of
facts
in
his
mind.
he
had
been
told
something
by
a
person
whom
he
says
he
knew
and
he
had
been
--
he
says,
he
believed
this
person
to
be
reliable
because
once
before
the
person
told
him
something
that
he
couldn't
substantiate,
but
he
has
nonetheless
believed
that
what
they
told
him
was
true,
notwithstanding
that
there
was
no
basis
for
believing
it
to
be
so.
when
officer
connolly
was
told,
there
is
a
man
in
that
car
with
a
gun
at
his
waist
and
drugs,
he
was
looking
across
the
street
at
a
car
with
a
man
seated
in
a
passenger
side,
he
saw
the
man,
he
saw
the
car.
at
that
point
he
then
called
the
station
and
elicited
help,
asked
them
to
send
another
cruiser.
having
dispatched
another
cruiser,
officer
connolly
then
started
across
the
street
proceeding
in
uniform
towards
that
vehicle,
walking
to
the
front
of
the
vehicle
where
he
was
obviously
in
plain
view
of
the
passenger
inside,
up
to
the
side
of
the
car
and
knocked
on
the
side
window
and
said,
“open
the
door.”
at
that
point
the
window
was
rolled
down
which
would
infer
possibly
that
the
person
wanted
to
find
out
why
the
officer
was
knocking
on
the
window
and
that's
about
as
much
as
one
might
reasonably
draw
from
that.
when
he
looked
inside,
he
saw
a
man,
he
didn't
know,
he
saw
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary,
the
man
didn't
do
anything,
the
man
didn't
say
anything.
he
couldn't
see
any
gun,
he
couldn't
see
anything
in
the
car
that
would
indicate
contraband
or
criminal
activity.
he
then
reached
in
the
record
sense
to
show,
he
reached
partially
under
the
man's
coat,
apparently
the
coat
was
in
a
loosened
position
down
and
his
hand
reached
the
waistband
and
did
touch
a
gun,
he
then
withdrew
the
gun.
at
that
point,
officer
connolly,
i
would
summit
under
connecticut
law,
still
had
no
probable
cause
to
believe
that
any
crime
had
been
committed
because
in
connecticut,
it's
not
a
crime
to
carry
a
gun
at
your
waist.
unfortunately
--
alright,
well
i
won't,
i
have
positive
comment
on
my
feelings
about
those
laws
but
connecticut
appears
to
be
a
pro-gun
state.
our
constitution
protects
the
right
of
individuals
to
carry
guns
in
their
own
defense.
we
have
statutes
which
permit
people
to
carry
guns
around
at
their
waist
or
in
their
car
or
hidden
in
their
purse
and
concealed
wherever
they
please.
the
only
requirement
being
either
that
they
come
within
one
of
approximately
10
exceptions
in
the
statute
which
permit
people
to
carry
guns
without
permits
or
that
they
have
a
permit.
so,
when
officer
connolly
knew
a
man
had
a
gun,
that's
all
he
know,
he
didn't
know
that
the
man
was
commenting
a
crime.
when
he
withdrew
the
gun
from
mr.
william's
waistband,
he
still
didn't
have
a
probable
cause
i
would
summit
to
arrest
him.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
he
was
convicted
of
a
crime
under
29-35
which
is
carrying
a
gun
without
a
permit
and
then
he
was
--
the
machete
--
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
as
it
was
ultimately
proved
in
a
trial,
he
was
not
for
example,
carrying
the
gun
as
part
of
transporting
his
household
goods
or
carrying
his
gun
for
merchandising
purposes
or
carrying
a
gun
from
a
dealer
to
his
home.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
well,
and
i
would
submit
it
would
be
--
be
likely
that
a
man
could
be
out
at
2
o'clock
in
the
morning
with
a
gun
at
his
waist
and
have
a
permit
for
it.
i
would
think
frankly
that,
that
very
often
people
do
carry
their,
carry
their
guns
at
2
in
the
morning.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
not
under
the
statute
of
connecticut
no.
now
the
statute
in
connecticut
as
it's
construed
by
our
courts
and
in
cases
where
it's
tried
requires
the
state
to
prove
the
negative
that
he
did
not
have
a
permit
in
order
to
sustain
its
burden.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
i
would
say,
usually
ask
the
man.
frankly
at
that
point
i
would
say,
they
didn't
believe
and
they
would
probably
determine
from
the
man
where
he
got
the
permit
and
would
contact
since
under
the
state
statutes
permits
are
issued
by
a
number
of
authorities,
including
any
municipal
officer
or
any
chief
of
police
of
any
particular
town.
so
the
permit
that
a
man
carries
is
generally
issued
from
one
jurisdiction,
such
as
say
the
town
of
windsor,
they
could
get
on
the
radio
and
determine
whether
or
not
a
permit
was
issued
to
a
particular
--
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
no,
mr.
williams,
according
to
the
record
was,
one
he
was
never
asked
the
gun
was
taken
and
the
policeman
said,
get
out
of
the
car
you
are
under
arrest.
he
was
then
body
searched
and
that's
the
time
when
the
heroin
was
seized
and
also
at
that
point,
of
course,
the
two
other
officers
had
arrived
on
the
scene.
williams
was
standing
out
of
the
car
immobilized
and
in
the
custody
of
other
two
officers
--
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
excuse
me?
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
that's
right.
he
was
arrested
because
the
officer
was
--
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
that's
right.
because
there
is
no
crime
for
carrying
a
gun.
there
is
only
crime
for
carrying
an
unregistered
or
a
gun
without
a
permit.
so
at
the
point
for
example,
i
could
be
carrying
a
gun
in
connecticut
--
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
that's
right.
i
would
say
that
would
be,
that
goes
--
actually
that
impacts
on
the
second
search.
there
were
in
effect
three,
i
would
submit
three
searches.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
in
hartford,
they
arrest
him.
they
take
him
down
to
the
station
and
if
after
they
check
him
out,
they
find
out
he
is
alright,
they
let
him
go.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
well,
because
--
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
well,
the
first
question
is
do
they
have
a
right
to
lay
a
hand
on
him
in
the
first
place
before
we
get
to
the
--
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
i
would
say
that
the
policeman,
that
would
then
come
in
to
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
policeman
has
a
right
to
make
an
investigative
detention
which
is
often
discussed
as
to
whether
or
not
at
that
point
they
have
a
right
to
hold
a
man
for
purposes
of
checking.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
alright.
what
they
do
to
is
they
hold
him
and
check.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
i
think
they
should
hold
him
and
check,
i
think
so.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
this
was
not
--
at
this
point,
they
had
already
seized
the
gun.
this
was
not
--
your
example
is
a
plain
sight
search.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
yes,
he
can
take
the
gun
away
from
him,
i
would
submit.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
yes.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
no,
i
don't
get
to
the
point
of
arguing
whether
or
not
that
that
is
constitutionally
permissible,
no.
i
am
saying
--
you
asked
me,
what
do
they
do
and
i
said
that's
what
--
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
alright.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
alright.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
i
would
say
in
connecticut
if
the
officer
observed
a
man
walking
down
the
street,
he
may
have
the
right
to
stop
him
to
inquire
as
to
what
he
is
doing.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
yes
and
the
man
doesn't
say
anything.
the
suggestion
i
would
make
is
that
under
connecticut
law,
he
would
not
have
any
right
to
hold
him.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
that
is
true.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
well,
it
isn't
to
me,
but
it
is
under
our
law.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
alright.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
oh!
yes.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
if
he
saw
a
man
crouched
pointing
a
gun
at
him
--
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
yes,
i
think
at
that
point
he
would
have
some
indication
of
additional
element
of
criminal
activity
just
by
the
point
that
the
man
--
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
alright.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
he
may
because
he
doesn't
have
to
believe
the
man
and
he
does
have
some
indications
in
the
first
instance
that
the
man
--
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
well,
then
the
question
would
go
down,
you
might
again
get
into
the
right
privilege
dichotomy
which
you
supplied
to
automobile
operation,
the
question
being
--
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
alright.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
alright,
well
he
still
is
confronted
with
the
situation
of
potential
assault.
he
is
not
just
confronted
with
the
situation
of
possession,
he
is
confronted
with
a
situation
of
use
of
a
deadly
weapon.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
well,
i
think
the
police
officer
is
justified
and
i
don't
think
that
the
police
officer
has
to
rely
on
the
citizen's
characterization
at
the
legality
of
his
conduct.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
because,
excuse
me
--
why
should
the
officer
disbelieve
him?
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
it's
not
--
i
don't
think
the
officer's
ultimate
determination
at
that
juncture
is
to
decide
facts
or
belief
or
not.
the
question
that
the
officer
has
to
do
is
to
respond
to
what
the
facts
as
he
sees
them
and
the
fact
says
you
have
presented
them,
indicates
a
person
holding
a
deadly
weapon
in
an
assaultive
position
and
further
advising
that
he
has
some
indication
he
wants
to
use
that
gun
for
an
assaultive
purpose.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
well,
that
--
i
seem
to
be
going
across
purposes,
but
the
point
is
not
whether
or
not
it's
good
or
bad,
the
point
is
whether
or
not
the
policeman
was
justified
in
interfering
with
the
citizens
liberty
or
take
some
action
vis-a-vis
that
citizen
at
a
point
where,
where
the
citizen
has
told
him,
he
is
holding
a
gun
within
an
intent
to
use
it,
notwithstanding
that
he
tells
to
me
that
he
intends
to
use
it
for
defensive
reasons
and
i
think
that
the
point
is
that
the
policeman
is
justified
in
acting,
notwithstanding
whether
or
not
the
person
might
have
the
right
to
use
it
for
that
reason.
that
the
two
are
distinct.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
yes.
i
would
submit
yes
that,
that
is
part
of
my
claim
but
that
even
if
it
were
not,
that
it
makes
the
case
no
weaker
because
the
basic
point
is
when
does
this
policeman
have
a
right
to
confront
a
citizen,
that's
where
you
start
i
believe.
kw
well,
now
assuming
that
he
had
reasonable
suspicion
under
terry
to
stop
the
person
and
make
and
ask
him
questions
and
protect
himself
during
that
period
he
could
(inaudible)
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
no,
it
depends
on
--
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
well,
that
depends
on
how
one
reads
terry.
i
didn't
read
terry
to
suggest
what
--
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
well,
if
terry
--
i
think
that,
as
i
read
terry
trying
to
square
it
with
the
fourth
amendment
limitations
on
any
invasion,
i
read
terry
as
saying
that
where
situations
arose
which
justified
a
police
officer
in
making
an
initial
stop
or
interfering
with
a
citizen's
liberty
for
the
purpose
of
inquiry
that
there
may
also
be
contemporaneous
right
to
make
a
body
search
or
a
body
frisk,
a
pat
down
for
defensive
purposes,
but
i
do
not
think
that
it
follows
that
every
time
a
police
officer
has
a
right
to
make
a
stop
that
he
has
a
concomitant
right
to
make
a
frisk.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
well,
that
takes
you
on
further.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
alright.
well,
no
i
do
not
know.
the
question
there
again
is
did
terry
say
that
anytime
a
police
officer
has
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
a
person
maybe
stopped,
he
may
also
contemporaneously
frisk
him
or
did
terry
say,
he
has
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
a
person
has
a
right
--
he
has
a
right
to
stop
the
person
and
he
further
has
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
the
person
maybe
armed
and
presently
dangerous
to
the
officer
or
to
the
public.
the
question
then
is,
is
a
citizen
in
connecticut
even
assuming
you
have
a
suspicion
that
--
a
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
he
is
armed,
does
that
ipso
facto
make
that
citizen
a
person
who
you
have
reasonable
cause
to
believe
is
presently
dangerous
and
i
go
back
to
the
connecticut
--
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
excuse
me?
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
it
is
no
different
because
you
have
a
right
to
carry
a
machete
in
connecticut.
connecticut
is
not
only
a
gun
state,
it
is
also
a
machete
state.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
well,
that
would
may
make
it
fairly
--
that
is
not
even
a
registrable
that
a
golf
club
has
in
fact
been
held
in
connecticut
not
to
be
a
deadly
weapon
and
not
subject
to
registration,
if
there
was
a
case
on
that.
the
point
that
i
have
been
trying
to
make
is
let
us
assume
there
was
no
gun
at
all,
let
us
assume
the
same
person
said
to
officer
connolly,
there
is
a
man
in
that
car
with
drugs
and
let
us
accept
the
fact
that
the
term
drugs
were
sufficient
to
place
in
officer
connolly's
mind
illicit
drugs
and
in
fact
i
believe
at
one
time
that
were
narcotics
was
used
and
in
most
other
testimony
the
reference
was
to
drugs.
my
claim
would
be
that
at
that
juncture,
officer
connolly
had
no
right
to
make
this
confrontation
and
having
a
right
to
make
the
initial
confrontation
whether
williams
was
standing
on
the
street
or
seated
in
a
car
or
seated
in
a
house,
then
therefore
nothing
followed
as
a
matter
of
right
from
that
including
the
right
then
to
make
a
body
search,
limited
or
otherwise.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
well,
i
think
the
scope,
it
is
really
not,
my
opinion
the
scope
of
officers'
duties
or
powers.
i
think
the
problem
becomes
whether
or
not
under
the
constitution
the
officer
has
a
right
to
intrude
upon
the
liberty
of
any
individual
and
if
the
officer
is
advised
as
to
a
certain
course
of
conduct,
the
officer
may
then
elect
to
go
and
investigate
that
course
of
conduct.
the
question
would
still
come
down
to
whether
or
not
in
the
course
of
that
election
to
investigate
further,
he
had
a
right
to
search
a
person,
right
to
search
any
citizen
and
i
would
say
under
the
facts
as
you
have
given
them
to
me,
it
would
have
no
doubt
caused
him
to
investigate
further,
but
i
do
not
believe
that
it
would
have
justified
any
intrusion.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
well,
first
of
all
he
would
have
--
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
well,
i
would
assume
if
the
officer
would
probably
be
more
interested
in
what
was
going
on
inside
the
bank,
not
what
was
going
on
inside
the
car.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
well,
that
i
suppose
different.
one
policeman
might
assume
that
the
greatest
source
of
concern
to
the
public
at
this
juncture
is
what
is
going
on
inside
the
bank,
and
might
elect
to
go
inside
the
bank.
another
officer
might
say,
maybe
i
should
stake
them
out
and
see
what
i
can
do
when
they
come
out
because
this
might
be
the
safer
course
from
a
public
point
of
view.
so
it
comes
back
--
always
it
evolves
down
on
to
the
officer's
judgment
and
i
do
not
believe
every
officer
would
act
the
same
way.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
no,
i
do
not
believe
this
court
has
ever
said
that
totally.
i
think
this
court
has
said
in
judging
the
conduct
of
a
police
officer,
consistent
with
fourth
amendment
limitations
on
that
officer's
rights,
due
regard
can
be
given
to
the
officer's
experience
and
to
a
subjective
standard
based
on
the
subjectivity
of
experienced
police
officers
or
a
subjective
objective
standard,
but
that
at
some
point,
this
court
i
understand
it
to
say,
you
have
to
stop
just
deciding
whether
or
not
every
policeman
would
do
the
same
thing,
and
start
deciding
whether
or
not
any
policeman
can
do
that.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
i
think
it
adds,
yes
i
think
it
would
a
fact.
i
think
it
would
add
another
fact.
i
cannot
say
whether
that
adds
up
to
a
probable
cause,
i
do
not
think
it
does,
but
i
think
every
case,
and
i
think
terry
pointed
that
out,
it
has
to
be
judged
and
it
is
extraordinarily
difficult
to
set
limits
within
the
context
of
this
set
of
facts.
my
initial
reaction
to
this
case
in
the
light
of
terry
is
that,
was
officer
connolly
justified
in
going
across
and
making
a
search
because
when
officer
connolly
went
across
the
street,
he
did
not
have
terry
versus
ohio
in
mind
because
terry
versus
ohio
was
two
years
away
at
that
time.
officer
connolly
knew
there
was
a
man,
he
was
told
there
was
a
man
with
a
gun
at
his
waist
and
drugs,
and
went
he
walked
over
to
that
car,
he
went
over
with
one
thing
in
mind
and
he
did
that
one
thing.
he
executed
a
body
search
of
that
one
man
to
seize
the
gun,
and
having
seized
what
he
was
told,
he
would
find,
he
decided
at
that
point,
he
was
going
to
arrest
him
and
that
to
me
is
what
happened
here.
this
isn't
--
to
me
this
is
not
what
i
conceptualize
to
be
a
terry
situation
which
i
read
as
being
an
attempt
to
relate
the
street
experience
problem
of
the
police
officer
to
the
limitations
of
probable
cause.
it's
otherwise,
i
find
it
difficult
to
square
terry
with
the
fourth
amendment.
but,
if
one
says
that
the
police
officer
has
legitimate
reason
at
certain
points
to
make
a
confrontation
and
having
made
that
confrontation
where
the
facts
present
themselves,
he
then
has
a
right
to
conduct
a
limited
pat-down
for
his
own
safety
or
for
the
safety
of
citizens,
then
it
is
more,
more
reasonable
to
relate
the
terry
situation
to
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
yes
i'd
say
depending
on
whose
opinion
one
draws
upon.
i'd
say
some
of
the
opinions
i
read
as
being
much
more
broader
than
that,
yes.
but
i
--
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
that
is
right.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
well,
looking
at
the
facts
in
terry
and
those
that
seem
to
be
most
persuasive
were
that
when
the
officer
mcfadden
in
the
terry
case
went
towards
the
three
suspects,
he
at
that
point
believed
that
he
was
looking
at
a
daylight
stick
up,
that
was
part
of
--
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
that
was
officer
mcfadden's
business?
well,
it
did
not
appear
to
me
that,
at
that
point
what
he
considered
to
be
his
business.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
that
is
--
yes,
that
isn't
in
the
context
of
terry
that
seems
to
be
one
of
the
suggestions
of
terry,
and
the
implication
as
i
read
terry
was
that
it
was
--
that's
why
i
said
that
it
seemed
in
terry
that
this
court
was
speaking
in
terms
of
the
street
confrontation
situation.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
i
got
far.
i
would
go
farther
at
that
point.
i
think
if
you
are
talking
about
a
policeman
being
informed
by
what
would
satisfy
the
standards
of
reliability
of
contemporaneous
criminal
conduct
being
committed
than
he
has
a
right
notwithstanding
terry
to
go
forward
and
to
make
an
arrest.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
yes
he
has
probable
cause
and
this
then
gives
him
the
right
to
go
forward
and
actually
confront
him
and
then
it
would
have
been
irrelevant
and
that's
why
to
a
certain
extent
even
the
application
of
terry
by
the
connecticut
supreme
court
was
irrelevant
because
the
connecticut
supreme
court
decided
that
there
was
a
reliable
informant
here.
and
this
then
framed
one
of
the
issues
which
was
that
issue
of
reliability.
since
--
i
would
submit
this
person
as
a
matter
of
law
was
not
reliable
and
i
would
also
submit
that
under
those
circumstances
that
terry
did
not
intend
to
fashion
a
new
doctrine
which
would
permit
police
officers
in
substance
to
make
searches
on
less
than
probable
cause.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
well,
i
think
this
court
can
make
that
inquiry
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
case
presents
one
that
requires
a
certain
decision.
i
don't
think
if
you
can
make
a
basic
credibility
determination,
no.
i
think
the
credibility
problem
might
cause
the
court
to
feel
that
this
was
not
the
appropriate
case
for
a
particular
decision
that
it
sought
to
render.
but
the
credibility
issue
is
not
substantially
in
dispute
other
than
that,
that
we
were
faced
with
a
situation
wherein
it
appeared
that
the
officer
relied
on
something
quite
different
from
what
we
subsequently
testified,
he
relied
on.
because
we
did
have
somewhat
of
a
conflict
between
the
lower
court
testimony
of
officer
connolly
and
the
superior
court
testimony.
but
taking
the
testimony
of
officer
connolly
as
100%
true,
you
are
still
left
with,
i
submit,
with
the
fact
situation
that
does
not
lend
itself
to
any
right
of
a
police
officer
to
go
forward
and
conduct
a
search
based
on
an
undisclosed
informant
who
did
meet
the
test
of
reliability
either
test
of
reliability.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
no,
i
said
it's
not
of
telling
the
truth,
i
said
so
far
as
the
test
of
reliability,
the
informant
in
this
case
according
to
officer
connolly
had
once
six
months
before
told
officer
connolly
there
was
a
homosexual
activity
going
on
in
the
bridgeport
railroad
station
and
--
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
no,
i
don't
read
that
at
all,
as
being
what
judge
friendly
said.
judge
friendly
went
at
some
length
to
discuss
the
basic
reliability
of
the
informant.
he
even,
for
example,
went
so
far
as
to
say
in
his
descent
that
let's
assume
that
this
tip
that
the
officer
had
received,
the
homosexual
conduct
had
been
verified
and
had
led
to
an
arrest.
judge
friendly
also
said
that
in
his
mind,
he
did
not
believe
that
this
would
make
this
person
a
reliable
informant
on
crimes
of
narcotics.
so
judge
friendly
did
not
--
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
right.
--
just
assume
that.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
alright.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
ultimately
yes,
yes.
but
that
again
is
--
i
am
sorry
my
time
expired.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
oh!
excuse
me.
my
ultimate
position
is
that
the
case
should
be
viewed
not
just
as
an
application
of
terry
versus
ohio
to
connecticut
or
sibron
versus
new
york
to
connecticut,
but
it
also
ought
to
be
viewed
in
the
context
of
the
connecticut
law
and
that
the
connecticut
law
as
i
view
it
is
different
totally
from
the
ohio
law,
and
the
statute
involved
in
terry
versus
ohio
was
printed
i
believe
at
page
1,
and
it's
like
the
sullivan
one
that
applied
in
new
york.
but
unfortunately
connecticut
does
not
so
legislate
and
i
think
that
makes
--
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
well,
yes,
but
they
--
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
yes,
but
the
terry
application
was
merely
dictum
to
that
because
the
court
found
in
19
that
there
was
a
reliable
informant
and
that
it
therefore
went
upon
the
rights
of
arrest
based
on
reliable
informant.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
well,
no
because
then
the
tip,
if
it
came
from
a
reliable
informant
was
a
tip
of
two
crimes,
one
being
gun
and
the
other
being
drugs.
if
they
said
that
they
had
--
the
officer
had
a
reliable
informant
who
told
him
there
is
a
man
seating
over
there
with
drugs.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
of
course.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
that
would
be
true,
that
would
make
no
difference
whether
or
not
the
gun
was
ever
mentioned
because
the
drugs
themselves
would
have
given
him
the
right
to
arrest
and
finding
of
the
gun
would
have
been
permissible
as
an
incidental
body
search
after
he
had
the
initial
right
to
arrest.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
no,
i
think
he
has
the
right
to
remove
it
temporarily
and
then
the
question
would
be
whether
or
not
he
had
the
right
to
return
it,
and
additionally
whether
or
not
he
had
the
right
to
--
he
has
the
right
to
remove
it
part
of
the
self
protective
body
search.
i
think
that
would
be
so.
and
that
would
be
because
he
has
probable
cause
to
believe
that
this
man
is
committing
a
felony,
so
he
has
a
right
to
remove
the
gun.
he
may
not
be
able
to
ultimately
to
charge
him
because
the
carrying
of
the
gun
maybe
lawful.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
well,
my
only
answer
i
can
give
you
to
that
your
honor
is
that
the
state
court
decision
in
williams
which
was
decided
in
--
actually
the
whole
case
was
framed
before
terry
was
even
thought
of.
and
when
the
connecticut,
the
supreme
court
decided,
if
you
examine
the
facts
of
the
connecticut
supreme
court,
they
say
that
this
was
an
officer
acting
on
what,
they
used
the
term
reliable
informant
which
has
been
defined
in
connecticut
to
mean
an
informant
who
conforms
to
the
aguilar-spinelli
test,
who
had
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
man
was
committing
a
drug
crime.
and
that
being
so
he
had
a
right
to
arrest
williams
and
therefore
they
said
also
by
way
of
i
would
submit
dictum
that
terry
versus
ohio
was
a
part
of
the
common
law
of
connecticut
and
obviously
i,
way
beyond
my
time
i
can't
argue
that
but
i
don't
say
it
ever
was
and
i
don't
believe
statutorily
it
can
be.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
only
additional
facts
which
i
would
add
in
order
to
give
some
clarification
to
the
situation
as
it
existed
in
1966
when
officer
connolly
met
this
informant,
was
that
after
officer
connolly
received
the
information,
at
that
juncture
officer
connolly
had
a
certain
set
of
facts
in
his
mind.
he
had
been
told
something
by
a
person
whom
he
says
he
knew
and
he
had
been
--
he
says,
he
believed
this
person
to
be
reliable
because
once
before
the
person
told
him
something
that
he
couldn't
substantiate,
but
he
has
nonetheless
believed
that
what
they
told
him
was
true,
notwithstanding
that
there
was
no
basis
for
believing
it
to
be
so.
when
officer
connolly
was
told,
there
is
a
man
in
that
car
with
a
gun
at
his
waist
and
drugs,
he
was
looking
across
the
street
at
a
car
with
a
man
seated
in
a
passenger
side,
he
saw
the
man,
he
saw
the
car.
at
that
point
he
then
called
the
station
and
elicited
help,
asked
them
to
send
another
cruiser.
having
dispatched
another
cruiser,
officer
connolly
then
started
across
the
street
proceeding
in
uniform
towards
that
vehicle,
walking
to
the
front
of
the
vehicle
where
he
was
obviously
in
plain
view
of
the
passenger
inside,
up
to
the
side
of
the
car
and
knocked
on
the
side
window
and
said,
“open
the
door.”
at
that
point
the
window
was
rolled
down
which
would
infer
possibly
that
the
person
wanted
to
find
out
why
the
officer
was
knocking
on
the
window
and
that's
about
as
much
as
one
might
reasonably
draw
from
that.
when
he
looked
inside,
he
saw
a
man,
he
didn't
know,
he
saw
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary,
the
man
didn't
do
anything,
the
man
didn't
say
anything.
he
couldn't
see
any
gun,
he
couldn't
see
anything
in
the
car
that
would
indicate
contraband
or
criminal
activity.
he
then
reached
in
the
record
sense
to
show,
he
reached
partially
under
the
man's
coat,
apparently
the
coat
was
in
a
loosened
position
down
and
his
hand
reached
the
waistband
and
did
touch
a
gun,
he
then
withdrew
the
gun.
at
that
point,
officer
connolly,
i
would
summit
under
connecticut
law,
still
had
no
probable
cause
to
believe
that
any
crime
had
been
committed
because
in
connecticut,
it's
not
a
crime
to
carry
a
gun
at
your
waist.
unfortunately
--
alright,
well
i
won't,
i
have
positive
comment
on
my
feelings
about
those
laws
but
connecticut
appears
to
be
a
pro-gun
state.
our
constitution
protects
the
right
of
individuals
to
carry
guns
in
their
own
defense.
we
have
statutes
which
permit
people
to
carry
guns
around
at
their
waist
or
in
their
car
or
hidden
in
their
purse
and
concealed
wherever
they
please.
the
only
requirement
being
either
that
they
come
within
one
of
approximately
10
exceptions
in
the
statute
which
permit
people
to
carry
guns
without
permits
or
that
they
have
a
permit.
so,
when
officer
connolly
knew
a
man
had
a
gun,
that's
all
he
know,
he
didn't
know
that
the
man
was
commenting
a
crime.
when
he
withdrew
the
gun
from
mr.
william's
waistband,
he
still
didn't
have
a
probable
cause
i
would
summit
to
arrest
him.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
he
was
convicted
of
a
crime
under
29-35
which
is
carrying
a
gun
without
a
permit
and
then
he
was
--
the
machete
--
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
as
it
was
ultimately
proved
in
a
trial,
he
was
not
for
example,
carrying
the
gun
as
part
of
transporting
his
household
goods
or
carrying
his
gun
for
merchandising
purposes
or
carrying
a
gun
from
a
dealer
to
his
home.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
well,
and
i
would
submit
it
would
be
--
be
likely
that
a
man
could
be
out
at
2
o'clock
in
the
morning
with
a
gun
at
his
waist
and
have
a
permit
for
it.
i
would
think
frankly
that,
that
very
often
people
do
carry
their,
carry
their
guns
at
2
in
the
morning.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
not
under
the
statute
of
connecticut
no.
now
the
statute
in
connecticut
as
it's
construed
by
our
courts
and
in
cases
where
it's
tried
requires
the
state
to
prove
the
negative
that
he
did
not
have
a
permit
in
order
to
sustain
its
burden.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
i
would
say,
usually
ask
the
man.
frankly
at
that
point
i
would
say,
they
didn't
believe
and
they
would
probably
determine
from
the
man
where
he
got
the
permit
and
would
contact
since
under
the
state
statutes
permits
are
issued
by
a
number
of
authorities,
including
any
municipal
officer
or
any
chief
of
police
of
any
particular
town.
so
the
permit
that
a
man
carries
is
generally
issued
from
one
jurisdiction,
such
as
say
the
town
of
windsor,
they
could
get
on
the
radio
and
determine
whether
or
not
a
permit
was
issued
to
a
particular
--
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
no,
mr.
williams,
according
to
the
record
was,
one
he
was
never
asked
the
gun
was
taken
and
the
policeman
said,
get
out
of
the
car
you
are
under
arrest.
he
was
then
body
searched
and
that's
the
time
when
the
heroin
was
seized
and
also
at
that
point,
of
course,
the
two
other
officers
had
arrived
on
the
scene.
williams
was
standing
out
of
the
car
immobilized
and
in
the
custody
of
other
two
officers
--
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
excuse
me?
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
that's
right.
he
was
arrested
because
the
officer
was
--
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
that's
right.
because
there
is
no
crime
for
carrying
a
gun.
there
is
only
crime
for
carrying
an
unregistered
or
a
gun
without
a
permit.
so
at
the
point
for
example,
i
could
be
carrying
a
gun
in
connecticut
--
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
that's
right.
i
would
say
that
would
be,
that
goes
--
actually
that
impacts
on
the
second
search.
there
were
in
effect
three,
i
would
submit
three
searches.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
in
hartford,
they
arrest
him.
they
take
him
down
to
the
station
and
if
after
they
check
him
out,
they
find
out
he
is
alright,
they
let
him
go.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
well,
because
--
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
well,
the
first
question
is
do
they
have
a
right
to
lay
a
hand
on
him
in
the
first
place
before
we
get
to
the
--
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
i
would
say
that
the
policeman,
that
would
then
come
in
to
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
policeman
has
a
right
to
make
an
investigative
detention
which
is
often
discussed
as
to
whether
or
not
at
that
point
they
have
a
right
to
hold
a
man
for
purposes
of
checking.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
alright.
what
they
do
to
is
they
hold
him
and
check.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
i
think
they
should
hold
him
and
check,
i
think
so.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
this
was
not
--
at
this
point,
they
had
already
seized
the
gun.
this
was
not
--
your
example
is
a
plain
sight
search.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
yes,
he
can
take
the
gun
away
from
him,
i
would
submit.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
yes.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
no,
i
don't
get
to
the
point
of
arguing
whether
or
not
that
that
is
constitutionally
permissible,
no.
i
am
saying
--
you
asked
me,
what
do
they
do
and
i
said
that's
what
--
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
alright.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
alright.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
i
would
say
in
connecticut
if
the
officer
observed
a
man
walking
down
the
street,
he
may
have
the
right
to
stop
him
to
inquire
as
to
what
he
is
doing.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
yes
and
the
man
doesn't
say
anything.
the
suggestion
i
would
make
is
that
under
connecticut
law,
he
would
not
have
any
right
to
hold
him.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
that
is
true.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
well,
it
isn't
to
me,
but
it
is
under
our
law.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
alright.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
oh!
yes.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
if
he
saw
a
man
crouched
pointing
a
gun
at
him
--
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
yes,
i
think
at
that
point
he
would
have
some
indication
of
additional
element
of
criminal
activity
just
by
the
point
that
the
man
--
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
alright.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
he
may
because
he
doesn't
have
to
believe
the
man
and
he
does
have
some
indications
in
the
first
instance
that
the
man
--
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
well,
then
the
question
would
go
down,
you
might
again
get
into
the
right
privilege
dichotomy
which
you
supplied
to
automobile
operation,
the
question
being
--
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
alright.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
alright,
well
he
still
is
confronted
with
the
situation
of
potential
assault.
he
is
not
just
confronted
with
the
situation
of
possession,
he
is
confronted
with
a
situation
of
use
of
a
deadly
weapon.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
well,
i
think
the
police
officer
is
justified
and
i
don't
think
that
the
police
officer
has
to
rely
on
the
citizen's
characterization
at
the
legality
of
his
conduct.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
because,
excuse
me
--
why
should
the
officer
disbelieve
him?
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
it's
not
--
i
don't
think
the
officer's
ultimate
determination
at
that
juncture
is
to
decide
facts
or
belief
or
not.
the
question
that
the
officer
has
to
do
is
to
respond
to
what
the
facts
as
he
sees
them
and
the
fact
says
you
have
presented
them,
indicates
a
person
holding
a
deadly
weapon
in
an
assaultive
position
and
further
advising
that
he
has
some
indication
he
wants
to
use
that
gun
for
an
assaultive
purpose.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
well,
that
--
i
seem
to
be
going
across
purposes,
but
the
point
is
not
whether
or
not
it's
good
or
bad,
the
point
is
whether
or
not
the
policeman
was
justified
in
interfering
with
the
citizens
liberty
or
take
some
action
vis-a-vis
that
citizen
at
a
point
where,
where
the
citizen
has
told
him,
he
is
holding
a
gun
within
an
intent
to
use
it,
notwithstanding
that
he
tells
to
me
that
he
intends
to
use
it
for
defensive
reasons
and
i
think
that
the
point
is
that
the
policeman
is
justified
in
acting,
notwithstanding
whether
or
not
the
person
might
have
the
right
to
use
it
for
that
reason.
that
the
two
are
distinct.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
yes.
i
would
submit
yes
that,
that
is
part
of
my
claim
but
that
even
if
it
were
not,
that
it
makes
the
case
no
weaker
because
the
basic
point
is
when
does
this
policeman
have
a
right
to
confront
a
citizen,
that's
where
you
start
i
believe.
kw
well,
now
assuming
that
he
had
reasonable
suspicion
under
terry
to
stop
the
person
and
make
and
ask
him
questions
and
protect
himself
during
that
period
he
could
(inaudible)
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
no,
it
depends
on
--
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
well,
that
depends
on
how
one
reads
terry.
i
didn't
read
terry
to
suggest
what
--
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
well,
if
terry
--
i
think
that,
as
i
read
terry
trying
to
square
it
with
the
fourth
amendment
limitations
on
any
invasion,
i
read
terry
as
saying
that
where
situations
arose
which
justified
a
police
officer
in
making
an
initial
stop
or
interfering
with
a
citizen's
liberty
for
the
purpose
of
inquiry
that
there
may
also
be
contemporaneous
right
to
make
a
body
search
or
a
body
frisk,
a
pat
down
for
defensive
purposes,
but
i
do
not
think
that
it
follows
that
every
time
a
police
officer
has
a
right
to
make
a
stop
that
he
has
a
concomitant
right
to
make
a
frisk.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
well,
that
takes
you
on
further.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
alright.
well,
no
i
do
not
know.
the
question
there
again
is
did
terry
say
that
anytime
a
police
officer
has
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
a
person
maybe
stopped,
he
may
also
contemporaneously
frisk
him
or
did
terry
say,
he
has
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
a
person
has
a
right
--
he
has
a
right
to
stop
the
person
and
he
further
has
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
the
person
maybe
armed
and
presently
dangerous
to
the
officer
or
to
the
public.
the
question
then
is,
is
a
citizen
in
connecticut
even
assuming
you
have
a
suspicion
that
--
a
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
he
is
armed,
does
that
ipso
facto
make
that
citizen
a
person
who
you
have
reasonable
cause
to
believe
is
presently
dangerous
and
i
go
back
to
the
connecticut
--
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
excuse
me?
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
it
is
no
different
because
you
have
a
right
to
carry
a
machete
in
connecticut.
connecticut
is
not
only
a
gun
state,
it
is
also
a
machete
state.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
well,
that
would
may
make
it
fairly
--
that
is
not
even
a
registrable
that
a
golf
club
has
in
fact
been
held
in
connecticut
not
to
be
a
deadly
weapon
and
not
subject
to
registration,
if
there
was
a
case
on
that.
the
point
that
i
have
been
trying
to
make
is
let
us
assume
there
was
no
gun
at
all,
let
us
assume
the
same
person
said
to
officer
connolly,
there
is
a
man
in
that
car
with
drugs
and
let
us
accept
the
fact
that
the
term
drugs
were
sufficient
to
place
in
officer
connolly's
mind
illicit
drugs
and
in
fact
i
believe
at
one
time
that
were
narcotics
was
used
and
in
most
other
testimony
the
reference
was
to
drugs.
my
claim
would
be
that
at
that
juncture,
officer
connolly
had
no
right
to
make
this
confrontation
and
having
a
right
to
make
the
initial
confrontation
whether
williams
was
standing
on
the
street
or
seated
in
a
car
or
seated
in
a
house,
then
therefore
nothing
followed
as
a
matter
of
right
from
that
including
the
right
then
to
make
a
body
search,
limited
or
otherwise.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
well,
i
think
the
scope,
it
is
really
not,
my
opinion
the
scope
of
officers'
duties
or
powers.
i
think
the
problem
becomes
whether
or
not
under
the
constitution
the
officer
has
a
right
to
intrude
upon
the
liberty
of
any
individual
and
if
the
officer
is
advised
as
to
a
certain
course
of
conduct,
the
officer
may
then
elect
to
go
and
investigate
that
course
of
conduct.
the
question
would
still
come
down
to
whether
or
not
in
the
course
of
that
election
to
investigate
further,
he
had
a
right
to
search
a
person,
right
to
search
any
citizen
and
i
would
say
under
the
facts
as
you
have
given
them
to
me,
it
would
have
no
doubt
caused
him
to
investigate
further,
but
i
do
not
believe
that
it
would
have
justified
any
intrusion.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
well,
first
of
all
he
would
have
--
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
well,
i
would
assume
if
the
officer
would
probably
be
more
interested
in
what
was
going
on
inside
the
bank,
not
what
was
going
on
inside
the
car.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
well,
that
i
suppose
different.
one
policeman
might
assume
that
the
greatest
source
of
concern
to
the
public
at
this
juncture
is
what
is
going
on
inside
the
bank,
and
might
elect
to
go
inside
the
bank.
another
officer
might
say,
maybe
i
should
stake
them
out
and
see
what
i
can
do
when
they
come
out
because
this
might
be
the
safer
course
from
a
public
point
of
view.
so
it
comes
back
--
always
it
evolves
down
on
to
the
officer's
judgment
and
i
do
not
believe
every
officer
would
act
the
same
way.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
no,
i
do
not
believe
this
court
has
ever
said
that
totally.
i
think
this
court
has
said
in
judging
the
conduct
of
a
police
officer,
consistent
with
fourth
amendment
limitations
on
that
officer's
rights,
due
regard
can
be
given
to
the
officer's
experience
and
to
a
subjective
standard
based
on
the
subjectivity
of
experienced
police
officers
or
a
subjective
objective
standard,
but
that
at
some
point,
this
court
i
understand
it
to
say,
you
have
to
stop
just
deciding
whether
or
not
every
policeman
would
do
the
same
thing,
and
start
deciding
whether
or
not
any
policeman
can
do
that.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
i
think
it
adds,
yes
i
think
it
would
a
fact.
i
think
it
would
add
another
fact.
i
cannot
say
whether
that
adds
up
to
a
probable
cause,
i
do
not
think
it
does,
but
i
think
every
case,
and
i
think
terry
pointed
that
out,
it
has
to
be
judged
and
it
is
extraordinarily
difficult
to
set
limits
within
the
context
of
this
set
of
facts.
my
initial
reaction
to
this
case
in
the
light
of
terry
is
that,
was
officer
connolly
justified
in
going
across
and
making
a
search
because
when
officer
connolly
went
across
the
street,
he
did
not
have
terry
versus
ohio
in
mind
because
terry
versus
ohio
was
two
years
away
at
that
time.
officer
connolly
knew
there
was
a
man,
he
was
told
there
was
a
man
with
a
gun
at
his
waist
and
drugs,
and
went
he
walked
over
to
that
car,
he
went
over
with
one
thing
in
mind
and
he
did
that
one
thing.
he
executed
a
body
search
of
that
one
man
to
seize
the
gun,
and
having
seized
what
he
was
told,
he
would
find,
he
decided
at
that
point,
he
was
going
to
arrest
him
and
that
to
me
is
what
happened
here.
this
isn't
--
to
me
this
is
not
what
i
conceptualize
to
be
a
terry
situation
which
i
read
as
being
an
attempt
to
relate
the
street
experience
problem
of
the
police
officer
to
the
limitations
of
probable
cause.
it's
otherwise,
i
find
it
difficult
to
square
terry
with
the
fourth
amendment.
but,
if
one
says
that
the
police
officer
has
legitimate
reason
at
certain
points
to
make
a
confrontation
and
having
made
that
confrontation
where
the
facts
present
themselves,
he
then
has
a
right
to
conduct
a
limited
pat-down
for
his
own
safety
or
for
the
safety
of
citizens,
then
it
is
more,
more
reasonable
to
relate
the
terry
situation
to
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
yes
i'd
say
depending
on
whose
opinion
one
draws
upon.
i'd
say
some
of
the
opinions
i
read
as
being
much
more
broader
than
that,
yes.
but
i
--
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
that
is
right.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
well,
looking
at
the
facts
in
terry
and
those
that
seem
to
be
most
persuasive
were
that
when
the
officer
mcfadden
in
the
terry
case
went
towards
the
three
suspects,
he
at
that
point
believed
that
he
was
looking
at
a
daylight
stick
up,
that
was
part
of
--
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
that
was
officer
mcfadden's
business?
well,
it
did
not
appear
to
me
that,
at
that
point
what
he
considered
to
be
his
business.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
that
is
--
yes,
that
isn't
in
the
context
of
terry
that
seems
to
be
one
of
the
suggestions
of
terry,
and
the
implication
as
i
read
terry
was
that
it
was
--
that's
why
i
said
that
it
seemed
in
terry
that
this
court
was
speaking
in
terms
of
the
street
confrontation
situation.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
i
got
far.
i
would
go
farther
at
that
point.
i
think
if
you
are
talking
about
a
policeman
being
informed
by
what
would
satisfy
the
standards
of
reliability
of
contemporaneous
criminal
conduct
being
committed
than
he
has
a
right
notwithstanding
terry
to
go
forward
and
to
make
an
arrest.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
yes
he
has
probable
cause
and
this
then
gives
him
the
right
to
go
forward
and
actually
confront
him
and
then
it
would
have
been
irrelevant
and
that's
why
to
a
certain
extent
even
the
application
of
terry
by
the
connecticut
supreme
court
was
irrelevant
because
the
connecticut
supreme
court
decided
that
there
was
a
reliable
informant
here.
and
this
then
framed
one
of
the
issues
which
was
that
issue
of
reliability.
since
--
i
would
submit
this
person
as
a
matter
of
law
was
not
reliable
and
i
would
also
submit
that
under
those
circumstances
that
terry
did
not
intend
to
fashion
a
new
doctrine
which
would
permit
police
officers
in
substance
to
make
searches
on
less
than
probable
cause.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
well,
i
think
this
court
can
make
that
inquiry
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
case
presents
one
that
requires
a
certain
decision.
i
don't
think
if
you
can
make
a
basic
credibility
determination,
no.
i
think
the
credibility
problem
might
cause
the
court
to
feel
that
this
was
not
the
appropriate
case
for
a
particular
decision
that
it
sought
to
render.
but
the
credibility
issue
is
not
substantially
in
dispute
other
than
that,
that
we
were
faced
with
a
situation
wherein
it
appeared
that
the
officer
relied
on
something
quite
different
from
what
we
subsequently
testified,
he
relied
on.
because
we
did
have
somewhat
of
a
conflict
between
the
lower
court
testimony
of
officer
connolly
and
the
superior
court
testimony.
but
taking
the
testimony
of
officer
connolly
as
100%
true,
you
are
still
left
with,
i
submit,
with
the
fact
situation
that
does
not
lend
itself
to
any
right
of
a
police
officer
to
go
forward
and
conduct
a
search
based
on
an
undisclosed
informant
who
did
meet
the
test
of
reliability
either
test
of
reliability.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
no,
i
said
it's
not
of
telling
the
truth,
i
said
so
far
as
the
test
of
reliability,
the
informant
in
this
case
according
to
officer
connolly
had
once
six
months
before
told
officer
connolly
there
was
a
homosexual
activity
going
on
in
the
bridgeport
railroad
station
and
--
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
no,
i
don't
read
that
at
all,
as
being
what
judge
friendly
said.
judge
friendly
went
at
some
length
to
discuss
the
basic
reliability
of
the
informant.
he
even,
for
example,
went
so
far
as
to
say
in
his
descent
that
let's
assume
that
this
tip
that
the
officer
had
received,
the
homosexual
conduct
had
been
verified
and
had
led
to
an
arrest.
judge
friendly
also
said
that
in
his
mind,
he
did
not
believe
that
this
would
make
this
person
a
reliable
informant
on
crimes
of
narcotics.
so
judge
friendly
did
not
--
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
right.
--
just
assume
that.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
alright.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
ultimately
yes,
yes.
but
that
again
is
--
i
am
sorry
my
time
expired.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
oh!
excuse
me.
my
ultimate
position
is
that
the
case
should
be
viewed
not
just
as
an
application
of
terry
versus
ohio
to
connecticut
or
sibron
versus
new
york
to
connecticut,
but
it
also
ought
to
be
viewed
in
the
context
of
the
connecticut
law
and
that
the
connecticut
law
as
i
view
it
is
different
totally
from
the
ohio
law,
and
the
statute
involved
in
terry
versus
ohio
was
printed
i
believe
at
page
1,
and
it's
like
the
sullivan
one
that
applied
in
new
york.
but
unfortunately
connecticut
does
not
so
legislate
and
i
think
that
makes
--
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
well,
yes,
but
they
--
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
yes,
but
the
terry
application
was
merely
dictum
to
that
because
the
court
found
in
19
that
there
was
a
reliable
informant
and
that
it
therefore
went
upon
the
rights
of
arrest
based
on
reliable
informant.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
well,
no
because
then
the
tip,
if
it
came
from
a
reliable
informant
was
a
tip
of
two
crimes,
one
being
gun
and
the
other
being
drugs.
if
they
said
that
they
had
--
the
officer
had
a
reliable
informant
who
told
him
there
is
a
man
seating
over
there
with
drugs.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
of
course.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
that
would
be
true,
that
would
make
no
difference
whether
or
not
the
gun
was
ever
mentioned
because
the
drugs
themselves
would
have
given
him
the
right
to
arrest
and
finding
of
the
gun
would
have
been
permissible
as
an
incidental
body
search
after
he
had
the
initial
right
to
arrest.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
no,
i
think
he
has
the
right
to
remove
it
temporarily
and
then
the
question
would
be
whether
or
not
he
had
the
right
to
return
it,
and
additionally
whether
or
not
he
had
the
right
to
--
he
has
the
right
to
remove
it
part
of
the
self
protective
body
search.
i
think
that
would
be
so.
and
that
would
be
because
he
has
probable
cause
to
believe
that
this
man
is
committing
a
felony,
so
he
has
a
right
to
remove
the
gun.
he
may
not
be
able
to
ultimately
to
charge
him
because
the
carrying
of
the
gun
maybe
lawful.
mr.
edward
f.
hennessey,
iii
well,
my
only
answer
i
can
give
you
to
that
your
honor
is
that
the
state
court
decision
in
williams
which
was
decided
in
--
actually
the
whole
case
was
framed
before
terry
was
even
thought
of.
and
when
the
connecticut,
the
supreme
court
decided,
if
you
examine
the
facts
of
the
connecticut
supreme
court,
they
say
that
this
was
an
officer
acting
on
what,
they
used
the
term
reliable
informant
which
has
been
defined
in
connecticut
to
mean
an
informant
who
conforms
to
the
aguilar-spinelli
test,
who
had
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
man
was
committing
a
drug
crime.
and
that
being
so
he
had
a
right
to
arrest
williams
and
therefore
they
said
also
by
way
of
i
would
submit
dictum
that
terry
versus
ohio
was
a
part
of
the
common
law
of
connecticut
and
obviously
i,
way
beyond
my
time
i
can't
argue
that
but
i
don't
say
it
ever
was
and
i
don't
believe
statutorily
it
can
be.
