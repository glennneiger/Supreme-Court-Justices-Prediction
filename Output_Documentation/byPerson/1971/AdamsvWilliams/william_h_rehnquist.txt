following
up
on
justice
steward's
question
of
a
moment
ago,
if
this
crime
took
place
in
1966
and
the
ultimate
decision
of
this
court
should
be
to
hold
that
the
evidence
was
improperly
seized
in
1972,
i
take
it
you
would
agree
that
if
the
purpose
of
the
rule
against
to
discipline
the
police,
it
would
have
somewhat
attenuated
effect,
if
it's
handed
down
six
years
after
the
event?

was
it
likely
that
he
would
have
fallen
under
those
circumstances
being
found
as
he
was
in
this
area,
2
o'clock
in

the
burden
of
proof
on
the
person
to
show
that
he
has
a
permit
after

is

justice

what
does
an
officer
do
in
that
situation
if
he
discovers
a
man
with
a
gun
and
doesn't
believe
he
is
within
the
ten
exceptions?
is
he
supposed
to
go
back
and
find
out
whether
he
has
a
permit,
or
does
he
ask
the
man
whether
he
has
got
a
permit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
was
no
indication
that
mr.
williams
made
any
representation
that
he
did
have
a
permit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly,
there
is
language
in
terry
that
goes
beyond
your
rather
narrow
reading
of
this,
isn't
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
don't
have
a
right
to
take
everything
you
find
in
an
incidental
body
search
unless
it's
contraband
for
use
in
committing
a
crime
and
i
take
it
your
argument
is
that
the
gun
doesn't
meet
those
tests?
