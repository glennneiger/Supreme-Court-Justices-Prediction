you
then
have
to
let
us
assume
that
the
promise
was
made
in
the
first
place
you
describe
that
assistant
us
attorney
and
then
in
further
conferences,
the
united
states
attorney
said,
i
understand
that
the
promise
has
been
made
to
you
but
i
want
you
to
know
that
there
was
no
authority
to
do
it
and
i
do
not
affirm
that
and
i
want
to
let
you
know
that
you
will
be
prosecuted
or
that
you
maybe
prosecuted.
you
have
to
take
your
chances
and
that
is
the
end
of
the
conversation.
then,
how
should
the
witness
testify
at
the
trial
when
he
is
asking
questions?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
was
made
a
promise
but
it
was
purportedly
revoked.
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
let
us
assume
that
he
did
go.
he
said
--
let
us
assume
that
he
testify
exactly
as
he
did
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
nevertheless
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
he
thought
he
could
be
prosecuted.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
you
should
have
told
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
important
facts
for
the
jury,
i
suppose,
is
whether
or
not
he
thought
he
could
be
prosecuted
at
that
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
important
fact?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agreed
that
there
is
wholly
another
question
where
he
told
the
exact
treason
or
not--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
terms
of
the
impact
on
the
jury,
the
question
is
whether
or
not
he
thought
he
could
be
prosecuted
at
that
time,
in
terms
of
the
impact
to
this.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
it
might
come
up
sometime
if
the
prosecuted
him
that
whether
or
not
the
first
promise
was
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
know
how
you
tied
that
up
with
the
credibility
if
you
thought
he
could
be
prosecuted
and
still
testified.
it
might
have
a
lot
to
do
with
whether
or
not,
he
would
testify.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
what
bothers
me
as
a
matter
of
the
facts
and
that
is
what
you
are
now
discussing
is
that
the
witness
taliento
on
cross
examination
said
this,
he
said
“nobody
told
me,
i
would
not
be
prosecuted”.
in
any
order
of
mr.
dipaola’s
affidavit
and
he
says,
“if
you
have
actually
testified
as
a
witness
for
the
government,
at
the
trial
of
the
defendant
giglio,
he
would
not
be
prosecuted.”
now,
those,
--
see
there
was
no
perjury
in
this
case,
but
those
are
just
two
statements,
a
180
degrees
apart.

you
already

he
had
already
testified
on
direct
examination
for
the
government
against
giglio.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
after
his
direct
testimony.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
his
words
were
and
nobody
told
me
i
would
not
be
prosecuted.
and
then
you
have
an
affidavit
from
an
assistant
united
states
attorney
saying
that
he
had
told
him
that
he
would
not
be
prosecuted.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
also
had--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
word
“nobody”
has
a
meaning
in
the
english
language,
does
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
dipaola
states
under
oath
that
he
did
tell
him
that
he
would
not
be
prosecuted?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
witness
says
nobody
told
me
that
i
would
not
be
prosecuted.
you
can
not
really
on
that
record
say
that
there
was,
could
be
no
finding
of
perjury
here,
could
you
tell
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
he
did
not
testify?
but
by
this
time,
he
had
testified

way
the
