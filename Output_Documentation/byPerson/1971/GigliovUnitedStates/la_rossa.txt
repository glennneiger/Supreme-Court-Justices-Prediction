mr.
la
rossa
united
states
attorney
enclosing
to
the
jury
said
he
referring
to
taliento
received
no
promises
that
he
would
not
be
indited.
so,
i
most
respectfully
submit
that
the
impression
that
was
given
to
that
jury
on
both
the
government’s
direct
case
and
the
cross
examination
by
petitioner’s
counsel
was
that
the
witness
was
taking
his
chances
in
coming
before
that
court
and
testifying
that
he
still
could
be
indited,
that
he
still
could
be
prosecuted,
that
he
had
no
assurances
from
anyone,
anyone
particularly
meaning
any
member
of
the
government.
mr.
la
rossa
yes
sir,
i
am.
i
am
stating
that
this
absolute
perjury
with
respect
to
this
witness’s
testimony
and
that
is
pouring
out
by
the
government’s
affidavits
and
opposition.
mr.
la
rossa
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
la
rossa
no,
i
do
not
believe
i
do
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
do
not
think
i
have
to.
i
think
whether
he
misunderstood
or
not,
certainly
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
in
that
court
room
had
no
right
to
misunderstand
and
as
i
will
get
to
further
in
my
argument,
he
should
have
had
an
absolute
knowledge
that
the
witness
taliento
was
testifying
before
that
jury
with
an
absolute
grant
of
immunity
given
to
him
by
an
assistant
united
states
attorney.
mr.
la
rossa
no
sir,
i
do
not
believe
so.
i
think
that
if
our
foundation
of
constitutional
safe
guards
has
to
depend
upon
the
fortuitousness
of
the
fact
that
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
trying
a
case,
and
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
who
makes
the
assurances
to
a
particular
witnesses
one
and
the
same,
then
we
are
on
rather
weak
case.
i
refer
to
judge
palmer’s
decision,
a
district
court
decision
in
the
southern
district
in
new
york
and
application
of
kapatos(ph)
where
he
said
referring
to
the
napeu
decision,
i
do
not
think
that
an
accused
right
as
defined
by
a
napeu
should
depend
on
the
fortuitous
circumstance,
but
the
district
attorney,
you
conducts
the
prosecution
and
the
investigation
be
one
and
the
same.
and
since
i
am
referring
to
that
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
also
bring
to
the
court’s
attention,
the
hawkins
decision
from
the
fifth
circuit
which
clearly
states
basically
the
same
thing
and
the
circuit
court
there
at
that
time,
in
1963,
decided
that
at
that
time,
these
witnesses
so
testified
the
government
must
be
judged
with
the
knowledge
that
the
testimony
was
false.
there
is
another
fact
at
here
too.
if
we
carefully
read
the
assistant
united
states
attorney’s
affidavit,
wherein
he
tells
us
that
he
made
a
grant
of
immunity.
he
tells
us
that
it
was
agreed
upon
between
taliento,
his
attorney
and
he,
the
assistant
us
attorney,
it
was
understood
and
he
also
tells
us
that
this
was
after
conference,
with
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation.
now,
those
of
us
who
events
on
experience
in
the
federal
court
know
that
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
and
the
case
agent
who
handles
a
particular
case,
and
in
this
particular
case
that
happened
to
be
agent
axton,
who
was
a
witness
of
this
trial,
would
be
the
one
who
received
this
information.
so,
not
only
does
the
assistant
us
attorney
who
gave
the
grant
of
immunity
of
the
grand
jury,
know
about
this,
but
we
must
assume
that
agent
axton
and
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
had
the
same
knowledge.
mr.
la
rossa
well,
the
affidavits
in
opposition
mr.
justice
marshall,
state
that
an
assistant
us
attorney
has
no
authority
to
grant
immunity
and
an
affidavit
from
mr.
hoey
suggest
that
this
can
not
be
done
and
judge
rio’s
decision
was
based
in
part
on
the
fact
that
our
assistant
us
attorney
has
no
right
to
grant
immunity.
but
i
respectfully
submit
to
this
court
that
if
a
hearing
was
held
at
that
time,
i
as
a
former
assistant
us
attorney
in
that
district
could
have
testified
as
could
any
assistant
in
that
office,
that
grants
of
immunity
were
made
in
the
regular
course,
to
get
a
witness
to
cooperate
with
the
government.
it
was
a
known
fact.
mr.
la
rossa
at
times,
he
did
sir
if
it
was
important.
mr.
la
rossa
well
mr.
justice
marshall,
my
i
add
one
thing
and
i
say
yes,
it
is.
mr.
la
rossa
yes
sir
and
further
than
that,
if
that
man
under
that
grant
of
immunity
testified
before
that
grand
jury
and
then
that
testimony
was
introduced
against
themselves,
would
this
court
uphold
one?
mr.
la
rossa
yes
sir,
i
understand
your
point.
mr.
la
rossa
well,
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
do
not
know
--
mr.
la
rossa
i
do
not
know
what
there
is
particular
regulation
with
treason.
mr.
la
rossa
i
do
not
believe
so,
no
sir.
but—
mr.
la
rossa
i
do
not
believe
sir.
i
think
this
court
would
prohibit
as
prosecution.
mr.
la
rossa
due
process
and
fair
play,
may
it
please
the
court.
that
one
who
gets
the
assurance
of
an
assistant
us
attorney,
acting
on
behalf
of
the
justice
department
and
not
district.
he
should
be
absolutely
allowed
to
rely
upon
any
promise
that
is
made
to
him
by
any
member
of
that
staff.
i
respectfully
submit
to
this
court
that
that
office
is
one
entity.
and
that
any
assistant
acting
on
for
the
authority
of
the
united
states
attorney
who
acts
on
for
the
authority
of
the
attorney
general—
mr.
la
rossa
i
would
guess
75
or
80?
mr.
la
rossa
if
that
particular
witness
acts
upon
that—on
that
belief
and
understand—
mr.
la
rossa
yes,
i
do
and
i
do
believe
he
can
and
so
does
the
solicitor
general
because
in
his
brief,
he
openly
states,
mr.
justice
marshall,
that
if
an
assistant
us
attorney
did
give
such
a
grant
of
immunity,
the
government
would
honor
such
a
grant.
solicited
general—
mr.
la
rossa
no
sir,
he
was
not.
mr.
la
rossa
yes
sir,
i
believe
it
is.
mr.
la
rossa
yes
sir,
in
the
affidavit
of
an
opposition
to
the
motion,
the
assistant
us
attorney
states
“i
gave
him
immunity”.
mr.
la
rossa
i
assume
that
is.
we
have
never
had
a
hearing
on
this,
and
the
hearing
has
been
denied
throughout
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
an
actual
immunity
was
given
or
not.
but
i
take
the
affidavit
of
the
government
in
opposition,
when
an
assistant
us
attorney
still
an
assistant
us
attorney
at
the
time
of
the
motion,
i
may
add,
states
unequivocally,
“i
give
him
immunity,
it
was
understood
and
agreed
by
the
parties
including
mr.
taliento
that
mr.
taliento’s
counsel
would
not
let
him
testify
unless
he
did
get
such
a
grant
of
immunity,
and
the
fulfillment
of
the
agreement
according
to
that
affidavit,
mr.
justice
brennan,
is
that
the
witness
taliento
would
then
testify
at
the
trial.
when
mr.
taliento
testify
and
petitioner's
trial,
he
completed
the
agreement.
there
was
nothing
left
for
him
to
do.
mr.
la
rossa
they
should
testify
at
the
trial
truthfully.
however--
mr.
la
rossa
exactly.
mr.
la
rossa
yes
sir.
mr.
la
rossa
then
mr.
justice
white,
he
should
testify—
mr.
la
rossa
he
should
have
stated
exactly
what
he
said
on
the
--
assistant
us
attorney
should
have
corrected
the
entire
facts.
mr.
la
rossa
yes
sir,
and
whether--
mr.
la
rossa
two
things,
whether
or
not
he
could
be
prosecuted.
mr.
la
rossa
yes
sir.
mr.
la
rossa
yes
sir,
i
have
a
tendency
to
agree
with
you
however,
i
do
believe
that
the
defendant
would
have
had
the
right
to
rebut
this
understanding
that
he
had,
even
though
it
was
as
assumed
that
it
was—
mr.
la
rossa
no
mr.
justice
white
that
is
not
what
i
am
referring
to.
what
i
am
suggesting
is
assume
as
you
said
it,
that
the
witness
had
the
understanding.
that
he
might
be
prosecuted
or
as
in
fact,
the
truth
is
he
could
not
have
been
prosecuted.
then,
that
fact
should
have
been
made
known
to
the
defendant
and
his
counsel
for
whatever
use
they
so
choose
because
i
respectfully
submit
this
had
to
be
close
issue.
it
was
a
one
witness
case
and
the
witness’s
credibility
is
the
only
important
thing
in
the
petitioner's
trial.
mr.
la
rossa
that
is
correct.
mr.
justice
white,
we
are
assuming
that
what
he
says
has
to
be
accepted
as
a
truism,
even
though
in
fact
there
is
not
truth
to
it.
and
i
submit
to
you
that
if
you
got
up
on
the
stand
and
made
any
kind
of
a
false
erroneous
statement,
whether
it
was
in
truth
something
he
believed
to
be
true
or
not,
the
assistant
us
attorney
prosecuting
that
case
would
have
the
duty
to
come
forward,
and
correct
that
false
impression.
i
refer
very
quickly
to
someone
who
makes
a
mistake
about
testifying
before
the
grand
jury.
if
a
witness
stood
before
the
court
and
when
asked
“did
you
ever
testify
before
a
grand
jury?”
answered
honestly
“no”
because
he
forgot
that
he
had
testified
before
that
grand
jury.
then
i
respectfully
submit
mr.
justice
white,
that
the
assistant
us
attorney
must
come
forward
and
say
“the
witness’s
an
error”.
he
did
testify
before
the
grand
jury.
here,
whatever
the
witness
believed
to
be
true,
the
us
attorney
and
the
government
had
a
duty
to
come
forward
and
say
“here,
you
did
ever
grant
him
immunity”
mr.
la
rossa
yes
sir.
i
do
believe
that
the
truth
of
the
transaction
would
be
extremely
important.
i
believe
so
as
the
trial
advocate
and
for
no
other
reason,
i
think
that
a
jury
is
seeing
a
witness,
testifying
whether
or
not
he
believed
he
had
an
absolute
grant
of
immunity.
but
if
that
jury
knew
that
he
had
an
absolute
grant
of
immunity
and
further
that
the
agreement
went
one
step
beyond
that.
it
said
you
must
testify
in
the
petitioner
giglio’s
trial,
then
they
would
have
the
right
to
believe
that
it
was
a
biased
interested
witness,
and
they
would
have
the
right
to
look
at
his
testimony
again
and
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
should
closely
scrutinize
it.
that
is—
mr.
la
rossa
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
not
believe
it
would
be
strong,
quite
frankly.
mr.
la
rossa
yes
sir,
i
think
the
fact
that
the
assistant
us
attorney
uses
this
in
his
closing
argument,
that
fact
alone
gives
it
such
a
greater
amount
of
credibility
to
the
jury
because
now,
the
assistant
us
attorney
is
making
the
same
statement
that
he
did
for
the
jury.
so
now
that
jury
and
we
must
assume
that
it
is
an
unsophisticated
jury
because
under
this
court’s
rulings
with
respect
to
jury
selection
now,
we
are
getting
unsophisticated
juries.
we
are
not
getting
juries
that
have
had
five
and
six
time
been
jurors
in
the
past,we
are
getting
jurors
now
that
have
only
sat
on
one
occasion.
so
when
the
witness
says
“i
do
not
whether
i
still
could
be
prosecuted
and
i
think
i
may
still
be
able
to
be
prosecuted”,
and
then
someone,
representing
the
united
states
government
stands
before
that
jury
and
emphasizes
the
very
same
fact,
then
the
degree
of
truth
i
think
is
enlarged.
so,
i
do
believe
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
fact
that
the
assistant
us
attorney
in
his
closing
statements
mentioned
this
and
accentuated
it
to
the
jury
makes
it
a
much
stronger
situation
and
it
would
be
out
--
mr.
la
rossa
yes
sir.
more
than
that
mr.
chief
justice
and
it
was
still
with
the
government
when
he
submitted
the
affidavit,
which
was
long
after
all
the
appellate
process.
he
was
still
with
the
government
until
few
months
ago.
he
was
an
assistant
us
attorney,
i
do
believe
this
year.
at
sometime
this
year,
he
left
that
office.
but
when
he
made
that
affidavit,
stating,
this
is
why
i
am
puzzled
of
the
solicitor
general’s
question
of
the
truth
of
the
affidavit
because
it
was
an
affidavit
submitted
by
the
government
in
opposition
to
the
petitioner's
motion
for
a
new
trial.
where
they
state
in
that
affidavit,
one
that
he
is
an
assistant
us
attorney
at
the
present
time
mr.
justice
white,
and
two,
that
the
acts
that
he
refers
to
were
done
at
the
time
when
he
was
an
assistant
us
attorney.
mr.
justice
marshall
asked
me
the
size
of
the
office
of
the
southern
district
in
new
york.
i
think
the
size
of
the
office
of
the
eastern
district
of
new
york
might
become
more
important
because
at
the
time
this
case
was
tried,
i
do
not
believe
there
were
more
than
10
assistant
us
attorneys
in
the
criminal
division,
and
carl
golden,
the
assistant
us
attorney,
who
tried
the
case
was
in
the
civil
division
and
brought
over
specifically
to
try
this
case.
i
have
no
absolute
proof
to
give
this
court
that
mr.
golden
knew
of
the
existence
of
this
agreement
or
did
not
know
of
it.
i
am
in
no
position
to
dispute
his
affidavit
quite
frankly,
but
it
is
the
petitioner's
position
with
respect
to
that,
that
he
should
have
known
about
it,
that
he
has
an
absolute
duty
to
inquire
that
if
mr.
dipaola
of
the
assistant
us
attorney
who
granted
this
immunity,
decided
not
to
tell
him,
or
forgot
it,
or
in
any
way
made
a
mistake
here,
this
court
can
not
pass
that
burden
on
the
petitioner.
mr.
la
rossa
yes
sir.
mr.
la
rossa
yes
sir.
mr.
la
rossa
yes
sir.
mr.
la
rossa
yes
sir,
i
can
and
what
they
did,
what
they
did
would
show
of
the
witness’s
grand
jury
where
he
testified
at
the
grand
jury,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
he
was
at
the
grand
jury
to
help
himself.
and
the
question
was
asked,
“did
you
tell
the
grand
jury
at
that
time
or
does
this
refresher
recollection
that
you
told
the
grand
jury
at
that
time
that
were
there
to
help
yourself?
and
he
said
“yes,
it
does
refresh
my
recollection
that
i
told
the
grand
jury
that
i
was
there
to
help
myself”.
that
question
and
answer
was
given
during
the
trial.
mr.
la
rossa
no
sir.
mr.
justice
holand
released
him
on
bail
after
this
court
granted
the
petition
for
cert.
mr.
la
rossa
he
has.
this
was
his
first
time
he
had
ever
been
involved
with
the
law
if
i
may
add
and
bail
was
refused
in
the
circuit
court
level.
mr.
la
rossa
i
do
believe
mr.
justice
stewart
that
this
court
should
ignore
those
affidavits
completely.
it
was
submitted
in
opposition
for
the
defendant’s
motion
without
the
right
of
confrontation
on
the
pointer
against
texas.
we
do
not
know
whether
these
actually
did
occur.
but
let
us
assume
that
they
did
occur.
let
us
assume
that
mr.
hoey
said
that
you
have
no
grant
of
immunity.
you
must
go
in
there
and
testify.
but
then
when
the
witness
does
testify,
see
at
the
point
of
that
meeting,
he
still
has
not
completed
his
immunity
bargain.
that
is
the
petitioners
point
with
respect
to
--
mr.
la
rossa
was
to
testify
at
the
trial.
mr.
la
rossa
exactly.
but
the
day
the
he
sworn
in
on
trial
and
testifies.
then,
we
go
back
to
mr.
dipaola,
the
assistant
us
attorney
who
granted
him
the
immunity
and
we
examined
all
of
the
conditions
he
put
forth
in
that
and
we
find
that
mr.
taliento
complied
completely
with
them
and
therefore
his
grant
him
immunity
is
whole,
secure
and
should
have
been
made
known
on
that
court
room.
whatever
occurred,
with
respect
to
mr.
hoey
at
that
meeting
and
we
do
not
know
what
happened,
because
we
never
give
the
opportunity
to
ask
anyone.
mr.
la
rossa
we
do
have
sworn
affidavits.
mr.
la
rossa
yes
sir,
but
my
sworn
affidavit
comes
from
the
government’s
affidavit
and
opposition,
not
from
mine.
mr.
la
rossa
mr.
justice
stewart.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
solicitor
general
interestingly
enough,
disputes
the
fact
that
this
meeting
ever
occurred
and
puts
forth
untested
affidavits
as
truth
with
respect
to
the
hoey
meeting
subsequent
to
the
grand
jury.
i
submit
that
an
affidavit
of
an
assistant
us
attorney
at
the
time
an
assistant
us
attorney
and
under
the
pressures
that
he
must
have
been
under
when
he
did
prepare
this
affidavit,
submitted
it
to
the
court.
it
must
be
considered
by
this
court
to
be
true.
why
else
would
it
be
given
and
why
was
he
retained
as
an
assistant
us
attorney
months
and
years
after
this
occurred.
but
again,
i
have
never
had
the
opportunity
to
ask
anyone
of
these
questions.
the
hearing
has
been
denied
throughout.
but
i
submit
that
going
back
to
the
affidavit
of
mr.
dipiola,
and
i
only
have
a
few
moments
left,
where
he
is
very
specific
about
this
and
i
assume
that
this
affidavit
was
read
and
re-read
and
everybody
must
have
had
a
voice
in
it.
mr.
hoey
was
very
confident
and
good
us
attorney,
and
i
am
sure
everybody
sat
down
and
read
this
and
just
did
not
submit
it.
but,
he
talks
about
taliento
and
giglio
being
arrested
in
the
rain
before
the
united
states
commissioner.
then
he
says
in
the
last
paragraph
of
the
first
page
subsequent
there
to,
and
after
conferences
with
special
agent
albert
o.
axton
of
the
fbi,
the
case
agent
of
the
trial
and
a
witness
for
the
government
of
the
trial.
your
deponent
conferred
with
the
counsel
for
the
witness
taliento,
present
at
the
conference
was
the
attorney
for
the
witness,
and
the
witness,
and
mr.
dipiola.
it
was
agreed,
that
if
robert
edward
taliento
would
testify
before
the
grand
jury
as
a
witness,
for
the
government
that
he
would
be
named
as
a
co-conspirator
and
would
not
be
invaded,
his
attorney
would
not
permit
robert
edward
taliento
to
testify
before
the
grand
jury
if
he
was
going
to
be
indited.
paragraph,
and
this
is
written
by
a
lawyer
may
it
please
the
court,
it
was
further
agreed
and
understood,
and
i
submit
that
those
words
become
very
important.
that
he,
robert
alec
edward
taliento
would
sign
a
waiver
of
immunity
from
prosecution
before
the
grand
jury
and
that,
if
he
eventually
testify
as
the
witness
for
the
government,
at
the
trial
of
the
defendant
giglio,
he
would
not
be
prosecuted.
that
is
not
an
equivocal
statement.
mr.
la
rossa
for
a
new
trial
sir.
mr.
la
rossa
that
is
correct.
mr.
la
rossa
no
sir,
there
was
not.
mr.
la
rossa
that
is
correct.
mr.
la
rossa
yes.
mr.
la
rossa
well,
judge
real
found
that
number
one,
the
us
attorney
was
the
only
one
to
give
such
an
immunity.
i
could
question
that.
mr.
la
rossa
with
respect
to
what?
mr.
la
rossa
no
sir.
all
factual
--
mr.
la
rossa
mr.
golden’
s
affidavit
has
conflict
with
mr.
dipaola’s
--
mr.
la
rossa
another
assistant
us
attorney
--
mr.
la
rossa
no
sir.
mr.
golden
says
i
was
never
told
of
this.
find
this—
mr.
la
rossa
he
said
that
mr.
dipaola
said
that
if
he
did
not
testify,
indict
him.
basically,
those
kind
of
words.
mr.
la
rossa
i
beg
your
pardon,
you
are
correct.
there
is
an
absolute
conflict
of
fact.
mr.
la
rossa
yes
sir.
mr.
la
rossa
as
this
court
held
in
that
view,
yes,
may
it
please
the
court
and
mr.
chief
justice
in
that
view,
this
court
said
just
the
fact
that
consideration
maybe
givento
this
man
and
there
was
a
question
about
that
too.
but
in
that
view,
this
court
held
that
that
should
have
been
made
known
to
the
court
and
jury.
we
go
all
up
further—
mr.
la
rossa
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
at
that
point,
government
must
come
forward.
mr.
la
rossa
absolutely
your
honor,
absolutely
your
honor.
if
the
witness
had
admitted
that
he
had
immunity
and
at
the
end
of
it,
the
government
would
have
no
burden
and
the
jury
would
be
able
to
assess
the
witness’s
credibility
with
respect
to
that.
i
see
both
my
lights
are
on.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
la
rossa
united
states
attorney
enclosing
to
the
jury
said
he
referring
to
taliento
received
no
promises
that
he
would
not
be
indited.
so,
i
most
respectfully
submit
that
the
impression
that
was
given
to
that
jury
on
both
the
government’s
direct
case
and
the
cross
examination
by
petitioner’s
counsel
was
that
the
witness
was
taking
his
chances
in
coming
before
that
court
and
testifying
that
he
still
could
be
indited,
that
he
still
could
be
prosecuted,
that
he
had
no
assurances
from
anyone,
anyone
particularly
meaning
any
member
of
the
government.
mr.
la
rossa
yes
sir,
i
am.
i
am
stating
that
this
absolute
perjury
with
respect
to
this
witness’s
testimony
and
that
is
pouring
out
by
the
government’s
affidavits
and
opposition.
mr.
la
rossa
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
la
rossa
no,
i
do
not
believe
i
do
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
do
not
think
i
have
to.
i
think
whether
he
misunderstood
or
not,
certainly
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
in
that
court
room
had
no
right
to
misunderstand
and
as
i
will
get
to
further
in
my
argument,
he
should
have
had
an
absolute
knowledge
that
the
witness
taliento
was
testifying
before
that
jury
with
an
absolute
grant
of
immunity
given
to
him
by
an
assistant
united
states
attorney.
mr.
la
rossa
no
sir,
i
do
not
believe
so.
i
think
that
if
our
foundation
of
constitutional
safe
guards
has
to
depend
upon
the
fortuitousness
of
the
fact
that
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
trying
a
case,
and
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
who
makes
the
assurances
to
a
particular
witnesses
one
and
the
same,
then
we
are
on
rather
weak
case.
i
refer
to
judge
palmer’s
decision,
a
district
court
decision
in
the
southern
district
in
new
york
and
application
of
kapatos(ph)
where
he
said
referring
to
the
napeu
decision,
i
do
not
think
that
an
accused
right
as
defined
by
a
napeu
should
depend
on
the
fortuitous
circumstance,
but
the
district
attorney,
you
conducts
the
prosecution
and
the
investigation
be
one
and
the
same.
and
since
i
am
referring
to
that
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
also
bring
to
the
court’s
attention,
the
hawkins
decision
from
the
fifth
circuit
which
clearly
states
basically
the
same
thing
and
the
circuit
court
there
at
that
time,
in
1963,
decided
that
at
that
time,
these
witnesses
so
testified
the
government
must
be
judged
with
the
knowledge
that
the
testimony
was
false.
there
is
another
fact
at
here
too.
if
we
carefully
read
the
assistant
united
states
attorney’s
affidavit,
wherein
he
tells
us
that
he
made
a
grant
of
immunity.
he
tells
us
that
it
was
agreed
upon
between
taliento,
his
attorney
and
he,
the
assistant
us
attorney,
it
was
understood
and
he
also
tells
us
that
this
was
after
conference,
with
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation.
now,
those
of
us
who
events
on
experience
in
the
federal
court
know
that
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
and
the
case
agent
who
handles
a
particular
case,
and
in
this
particular
case
that
happened
to
be
agent
axton,
who
was
a
witness
of
this
trial,
would
be
the
one
who
received
this
information.
so,
not
only
does
the
assistant
us
attorney
who
gave
the
grant
of
immunity
of
the
grand
jury,
know
about
this,
but
we
must
assume
that
agent
axton
and
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
had
the
same
knowledge.
mr.
la
rossa
well,
the
affidavits
in
opposition
mr.
justice
marshall,
state
that
an
assistant
us
attorney
has
no
authority
to
grant
immunity
and
an
affidavit
from
mr.
hoey
suggest
that
this
can
not
be
done
and
judge
rio’s
decision
was
based
in
part
on
the
fact
that
our
assistant
us
attorney
has
no
right
to
grant
immunity.
but
i
respectfully
submit
to
this
court
that
if
a
hearing
was
held
at
that
time,
i
as
a
former
assistant
us
attorney
in
that
district
could
have
testified
as
could
any
assistant
in
that
office,
that
grants
of
immunity
were
made
in
the
regular
course,
to
get
a
witness
to
cooperate
with
the
government.
it
was
a
known
fact.
mr.
la
rossa
at
times,
he
did
sir
if
it
was
important.
mr.
la
rossa
well
mr.
justice
marshall,
my
i
add
one
thing
and
i
say
yes,
it
is.
mr.
la
rossa
yes
sir
and
further
than
that,
if
that
man
under
that
grant
of
immunity
testified
before
that
grand
jury
and
then
that
testimony
was
introduced
against
themselves,
would
this
court
uphold
one?
mr.
la
rossa
yes
sir,
i
understand
your
point.
mr.
la
rossa
well,
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
do
not
know
--
mr.
la
rossa
i
do
not
know
what
there
is
particular
regulation
with
treason.
mr.
la
rossa
i
do
not
believe
so,
no
sir.
but—
mr.
la
rossa
i
do
not
believe
sir.
i
think
this
court
would
prohibit
as
prosecution.
mr.
la
rossa
due
process
and
fair
play,
may
it
please
the
court.
that
one
who
gets
the
assurance
of
an
assistant
us
attorney,
acting
on
behalf
of
the
justice
department
and
not
district.
he
should
be
absolutely
allowed
to
rely
upon
any
promise
that
is
made
to
him
by
any
member
of
that
staff.
i
respectfully
submit
to
this
court
that
that
office
is
one
entity.
and
that
any
assistant
acting
on
for
the
authority
of
the
united
states
attorney
who
acts
on
for
the
authority
of
the
attorney
general—
mr.
la
rossa
i
would
guess
75
or
80?
mr.
la
rossa
if
that
particular
witness
acts
upon
that—on
that
belief
and
understand—
mr.
la
rossa
yes,
i
do
and
i
do
believe
he
can
and
so
does
the
solicitor
general
because
in
his
brief,
he
openly
states,
mr.
justice
marshall,
that
if
an
assistant
us
attorney
did
give
such
a
grant
of
immunity,
the
government
would
honor
such
a
grant.
solicited
general—
mr.
la
rossa
no
sir,
he
was
not.
mr.
la
rossa
yes
sir,
i
believe
it
is.
mr.
la
rossa
yes
sir,
in
the
affidavit
of
an
opposition
to
the
motion,
the
assistant
us
attorney
states
“i
gave
him
immunity”.
mr.
la
rossa
i
assume
that
is.
we
have
never
had
a
hearing
on
this,
and
the
hearing
has
been
denied
throughout
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
an
actual
immunity
was
given
or
not.
but
i
take
the
affidavit
of
the
government
in
opposition,
when
an
assistant
us
attorney
still
an
assistant
us
attorney
at
the
time
of
the
motion,
i
may
add,
states
unequivocally,
“i
give
him
immunity,
it
was
understood
and
agreed
by
the
parties
including
mr.
taliento
that
mr.
taliento’s
counsel
would
not
let
him
testify
unless
he
did
get
such
a
grant
of
immunity,
and
the
fulfillment
of
the
agreement
according
to
that
affidavit,
mr.
justice
brennan,
is
that
the
witness
taliento
would
then
testify
at
the
trial.
when
mr.
taliento
testify
and
petitioner's
trial,
he
completed
the
agreement.
there
was
nothing
left
for
him
to
do.
mr.
la
rossa
they
should
testify
at
the
trial
truthfully.
however--
mr.
la
rossa
exactly.
mr.
la
rossa
yes
sir.
mr.
la
rossa
then
mr.
justice
white,
he
should
testify—
mr.
la
rossa
he
should
have
stated
exactly
what
he
said
on
the
--
assistant
us
attorney
should
have
corrected
the
entire
facts.
mr.
la
rossa
yes
sir,
and
whether--
mr.
la
rossa
two
things,
whether
or
not
he
could
be
prosecuted.
mr.
la
rossa
yes
sir.
mr.
la
rossa
yes
sir,
i
have
a
tendency
to
agree
with
you
however,
i
do
believe
that
the
defendant
would
have
had
the
right
to
rebut
this
understanding
that
he
had,
even
though
it
was
as
assumed
that
it
was—
mr.
la
rossa
no
mr.
justice
white
that
is
not
what
i
am
referring
to.
what
i
am
suggesting
is
assume
as
you
said
it,
that
the
witness
had
the
understanding.
that
he
might
be
prosecuted
or
as
in
fact,
the
truth
is
he
could
not
have
been
prosecuted.
then,
that
fact
should
have
been
made
known
to
the
defendant
and
his
counsel
for
whatever
use
they
so
choose
because
i
respectfully
submit
this
had
to
be
close
issue.
it
was
a
one
witness
case
and
the
witness’s
credibility
is
the
only
important
thing
in
the
petitioner's
trial.
mr.
la
rossa
that
is
correct.
mr.
justice
white,
we
are
assuming
that
what
he
says
has
to
be
accepted
as
a
truism,
even
though
in
fact
there
is
not
truth
to
it.
and
i
submit
to
you
that
if
you
got
up
on
the
stand
and
made
any
kind
of
a
false
erroneous
statement,
whether
it
was
in
truth
something
he
believed
to
be
true
or
not,
the
assistant
us
attorney
prosecuting
that
case
would
have
the
duty
to
come
forward,
and
correct
that
false
impression.
i
refer
very
quickly
to
someone
who
makes
a
mistake
about
testifying
before
the
grand
jury.
if
a
witness
stood
before
the
court
and
when
asked
“did
you
ever
testify
before
a
grand
jury?”
answered
honestly
“no”
because
he
forgot
that
he
had
testified
before
that
grand
jury.
then
i
respectfully
submit
mr.
justice
white,
that
the
assistant
us
attorney
must
come
forward
and
say
“the
witness’s
an
error”.
he
did
testify
before
the
grand
jury.
here,
whatever
the
witness
believed
to
be
true,
the
us
attorney
and
the
government
had
a
duty
to
come
forward
and
say
“here,
you
did
ever
grant
him
immunity”
mr.
la
rossa
yes
sir.
i
do
believe
that
the
truth
of
the
transaction
would
be
extremely
important.
i
believe
so
as
the
trial
advocate
and
for
no
other
reason,
i
think
that
a
jury
is
seeing
a
witness,
testifying
whether
or
not
he
believed
he
had
an
absolute
grant
of
immunity.
but
if
that
jury
knew
that
he
had
an
absolute
grant
of
immunity
and
further
that
the
agreement
went
one
step
beyond
that.
it
said
you
must
testify
in
the
petitioner
giglio’s
trial,
then
they
would
have
the
right
to
believe
that
it
was
a
biased
interested
witness,
and
they
would
have
the
right
to
look
at
his
testimony
again
and
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
should
closely
scrutinize
it.
that
is—
mr.
la
rossa
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
not
believe
it
would
be
strong,
quite
frankly.
mr.
la
rossa
yes
sir,
i
think
the
fact
that
the
assistant
us
attorney
uses
this
in
his
closing
argument,
that
fact
alone
gives
it
such
a
greater
amount
of
credibility
to
the
jury
because
now,
the
assistant
us
attorney
is
making
the
same
statement
that
he
did
for
the
jury.
so
now
that
jury
and
we
must
assume
that
it
is
an
unsophisticated
jury
because
under
this
court’s
rulings
with
respect
to
jury
selection
now,
we
are
getting
unsophisticated
juries.
we
are
not
getting
juries
that
have
had
five
and
six
time
been
jurors
in
the
past,we
are
getting
jurors
now
that
have
only
sat
on
one
occasion.
so
when
the
witness
says
“i
do
not
whether
i
still
could
be
prosecuted
and
i
think
i
may
still
be
able
to
be
prosecuted”,
and
then
someone,
representing
the
united
states
government
stands
before
that
jury
and
emphasizes
the
very
same
fact,
then
the
degree
of
truth
i
think
is
enlarged.
so,
i
do
believe
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
fact
that
the
assistant
us
attorney
in
his
closing
statements
mentioned
this
and
accentuated
it
to
the
jury
makes
it
a
much
stronger
situation
and
it
would
be
out
--
mr.
la
rossa
yes
sir.
more
than
that
mr.
chief
justice
and
it
was
still
with
the
government
when
he
submitted
the
affidavit,
which
was
long
after
all
the
appellate
process.
he
was
still
with
the
government
until
few
months
ago.
he
was
an
assistant
us
attorney,
i
do
believe
this
year.
at
sometime
this
year,
he
left
that
office.
but
when
he
made
that
affidavit,
stating,
this
is
why
i
am
puzzled
of
the
solicitor
general’s
question
of
the
truth
of
the
affidavit
because
it
was
an
affidavit
submitted
by
the
government
in
opposition
to
the
petitioner's
motion
for
a
new
trial.
where
they
state
in
that
affidavit,
one
that
he
is
an
assistant
us
attorney
at
the
present
time
mr.
justice
white,
and
two,
that
the
acts
that
he
refers
to
were
done
at
the
time
when
he
was
an
assistant
us
attorney.
mr.
justice
marshall
asked
me
the
size
of
the
office
of
the
southern
district
in
new
york.
i
think
the
size
of
the
office
of
the
eastern
district
of
new
york
might
become
more
important
because
at
the
time
this
case
was
tried,
i
do
not
believe
there
were
more
than
10
assistant
us
attorneys
in
the
criminal
division,
and
carl
golden,
the
assistant
us
attorney,
who
tried
the
case
was
in
the
civil
division
and
brought
over
specifically
to
try
this
case.
i
have
no
absolute
proof
to
give
this
court
that
mr.
golden
knew
of
the
existence
of
this
agreement
or
did
not
know
of
it.
i
am
in
no
position
to
dispute
his
affidavit
quite
frankly,
but
it
is
the
petitioner's
position
with
respect
to
that,
that
he
should
have
known
about
it,
that
he
has
an
absolute
duty
to
inquire
that
if
mr.
dipaola
of
the
assistant
us
attorney
who
granted
this
immunity,
decided
not
to
tell
him,
or
forgot
it,
or
in
any
way
made
a
mistake
here,
this
court
can
not
pass
that
burden
on
the
petitioner.
mr.
la
rossa
yes
sir.
mr.
la
rossa
yes
sir.
mr.
la
rossa
yes
sir.
mr.
la
rossa
yes
sir,
i
can
and
what
they
did,
what
they
did
would
show
of
the
witness’s
grand
jury
where
he
testified
at
the
grand
jury,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
he
was
at
the
grand
jury
to
help
himself.
and
the
question
was
asked,
“did
you
tell
the
grand
jury
at
that
time
or
does
this
refresher
recollection
that
you
told
the
grand
jury
at
that
time
that
were
there
to
help
yourself?
and
he
said
“yes,
it
does
refresh
my
recollection
that
i
told
the
grand
jury
that
i
was
there
to
help
myself”.
that
question
and
answer
was
given
during
the
trial.
mr.
la
rossa
no
sir.
mr.
justice
holand
released
him
on
bail
after
this
court
granted
the
petition
for
cert.
mr.
la
rossa
he
has.
this
was
his
first
time
he
had
ever
been
involved
with
the
law
if
i
may
add
and
bail
was
refused
in
the
circuit
court
level.
mr.
la
rossa
i
do
believe
mr.
justice
stewart
that
this
court
should
ignore
those
affidavits
completely.
it
was
submitted
in
opposition
for
the
defendant’s
motion
without
the
right
of
confrontation
on
the
pointer
against
texas.
we
do
not
know
whether
these
actually
did
occur.
but
let
us
assume
that
they
did
occur.
let
us
assume
that
mr.
hoey
said
that
you
have
no
grant
of
immunity.
you
must
go
in
there
and
testify.
but
then
when
the
witness
does
testify,
see
at
the
point
of
that
meeting,
he
still
has
not
completed
his
immunity
bargain.
that
is
the
petitioners
point
with
respect
to
--
mr.
la
rossa
was
to
testify
at
the
trial.
mr.
la
rossa
exactly.
but
the
day
the
he
sworn
in
on
trial
and
testifies.
then,
we
go
back
to
mr.
dipaola,
the
assistant
us
attorney
who
granted
him
the
immunity
and
we
examined
all
of
the
conditions
he
put
forth
in
that
and
we
find
that
mr.
taliento
complied
completely
with
them
and
therefore
his
grant
him
immunity
is
whole,
secure
and
should
have
been
made
known
on
that
court
room.
whatever
occurred,
with
respect
to
mr.
hoey
at
that
meeting
and
we
do
not
know
what
happened,
because
we
never
give
the
opportunity
to
ask
anyone.
mr.
la
rossa
we
do
have
sworn
affidavits.
mr.
la
rossa
yes
sir,
but
my
sworn
affidavit
comes
from
the
government’s
affidavit
and
opposition,
not
from
mine.
mr.
la
rossa
mr.
justice
stewart.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
solicitor
general
interestingly
enough,
disputes
the
fact
that
this
meeting
ever
occurred
and
puts
forth
untested
affidavits
as
truth
with
respect
to
the
hoey
meeting
subsequent
to
the
grand
jury.
i
submit
that
an
affidavit
of
an
assistant
us
attorney
at
the
time
an
assistant
us
attorney
and
under
the
pressures
that
he
must
have
been
under
when
he
did
prepare
this
affidavit,
submitted
it
to
the
court.
it
must
be
considered
by
this
court
to
be
true.
why
else
would
it
be
given
and
why
was
he
retained
as
an
assistant
us
attorney
months
and
years
after
this
occurred.
but
again,
i
have
never
had
the
opportunity
to
ask
anyone
of
these
questions.
the
hearing
has
been
denied
throughout.
but
i
submit
that
going
back
to
the
affidavit
of
mr.
dipiola,
and
i
only
have
a
few
moments
left,
where
he
is
very
specific
about
this
and
i
assume
that
this
affidavit
was
read
and
re-read
and
everybody
must
have
had
a
voice
in
it.
mr.
hoey
was
very
confident
and
good
us
attorney,
and
i
am
sure
everybody
sat
down
and
read
this
and
just
did
not
submit
it.
but,
he
talks
about
taliento
and
giglio
being
arrested
in
the
rain
before
the
united
states
commissioner.
then
he
says
in
the
last
paragraph
of
the
first
page
subsequent
there
to,
and
after
conferences
with
special
agent
albert
o.
axton
of
the
fbi,
the
case
agent
of
the
trial
and
a
witness
for
the
government
of
the
trial.
your
deponent
conferred
with
the
counsel
for
the
witness
taliento,
present
at
the
conference
was
the
attorney
for
the
witness,
and
the
witness,
and
mr.
dipiola.
it
was
agreed,
that
if
robert
edward
taliento
would
testify
before
the
grand
jury
as
a
witness,
for
the
government
that
he
would
be
named
as
a
co-conspirator
and
would
not
be
invaded,
his
attorney
would
not
permit
robert
edward
taliento
to
testify
before
the
grand
jury
if
he
was
going
to
be
indited.
paragraph,
and
this
is
written
by
a
lawyer
may
it
please
the
court,
it
was
further
agreed
and
understood,
and
i
submit
that
those
words
become
very
important.
that
he,
robert
alec
edward
taliento
would
sign
a
waiver
of
immunity
from
prosecution
before
the
grand
jury
and
that,
if
he
eventually
testify
as
the
witness
for
the
government,
at
the
trial
of
the
defendant
giglio,
he
would
not
be
prosecuted.
that
is
not
an
equivocal
statement.
mr.
la
rossa
for
a
new
trial
sir.
mr.
la
rossa
that
is
correct.
mr.
la
rossa
no
sir,
there
was
not.
mr.
la
rossa
that
is
correct.
mr.
la
rossa
yes.
mr.
la
rossa
well,
judge
real
found
that
number
one,
the
us
attorney
was
the
only
one
to
give
such
an
immunity.
i
could
question
that.
mr.
la
rossa
with
respect
to
what?
mr.
la
rossa
no
sir.
all
factual
--
mr.
la
rossa
mr.
golden’
s
affidavit
has
conflict
with
mr.
dipaola’s
--
mr.
la
rossa
another
assistant
us
attorney
--
mr.
la
rossa
no
sir.
mr.
golden
says
i
was
never
told
of
this.
find
this—
mr.
la
rossa
he
said
that
mr.
dipaola
said
that
if
he
did
not
testify,
indict
him.
basically,
those
kind
of
words.
mr.
la
rossa
i
beg
your
pardon,
you
are
correct.
there
is
an
absolute
conflict
of
fact.
mr.
la
rossa
yes
sir.
mr.
la
rossa
as
this
court
held
in
that
view,
yes,
may
it
please
the
court
and
mr.
chief
justice
in
that
view,
this
court
said
just
the
fact
that
consideration
maybe
givento
this
man
and
there
was
a
question
about
that
too.
but
in
that
view,
this
court
held
that
that
should
have
been
made
known
to
the
court
and
jury.
we
go
all
up
further—
mr.
la
rossa
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
at
that
point,
government
must
come
forward.
mr.
la
rossa
absolutely
your
honor,
absolutely
your
honor.
if
the
witness
had
admitted
that
he
had
immunity
and
at
the
end
of
it,
the
government
would
have
no
burden
and
the
jury
would
be
able
to
assess
the
witness’s
credibility
with
respect
to
that.
i
see
both
my
lights
are
on.
thank
you
very
much.
