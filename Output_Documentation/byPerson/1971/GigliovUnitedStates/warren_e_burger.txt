chief

mr.

based

chief

you

then
there

break
in

point
of

he
gave
him
the

asked
does
that

and
can
you—
chief

can
you
fill
in
the
gap
--
what—
chief

warren
e.

i
take
it
mr.

that
the
essence
of
your
argument
is
that
whatever
understanding
disagreements,
discussions
there
are
about,
not
indicting

indicting
must
be
disclosed.

and
whether
there
is
in

a
binding
to

whether
there

not.
just
there
have
been
discussions
that
he
could
be
a
reasonable
man
who
believe
that
the
prosecution
was
not
going
to
be
pursued,
even
if
it

that

what

it

the

which

do
not
you
agree
that
there
is
a
conflict
as
justice

pointed
out?
chief

what
if
on
a
hearing

chief

i
am
a
little
puzzled

your
suggestion

the
hypothetical
situation.
suppose
these
were
more
specific.
the
hearing
was
held

dipaola,
was
called

took
the
stand

admitted
that
his

out
of

with

this
is—
chief

or
one
of
the
two
times,
he
was
not
telling
the
truth?
chief

and
should
that
not
be
resolved
by
a
finding

explicitly?
chief

there
are
some
suggestion
here
about

what
evidence
as
distinguished

was
introduced
to

chief

it
was
just
an
argument
to
the

i
see-

what
is
that
that
prevents
him
being
