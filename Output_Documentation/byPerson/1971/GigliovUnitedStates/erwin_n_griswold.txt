mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
the
petitioner
began
by
giving
very
selective
view
of
the
facts
of
this
case,
thought
i
think
that
now,
most
of
facts
are
out
on
the
table
as
basis
of
the
questioning
in
the
last
five
or
10
minutes.
i
would
like
to
take
the
petitioner’s
contentions
in
this
order.
first,
the
petitioner
contends
that
the
government
witness
taliento
lied
and
truly
what
it
is.
he
did
not
tell
the
truth
to
the
court,
and
that
the
government
knowing
that
he
did
not
tell
the
truth
failed
to
correct,
and
the
petitioner
also
urges
that
the
case
was
in
some
way
shaky
anyway
with
this
taliento
was
the
only
witness
for
the
government.
i
want
to
start
with
that
second
point
first.
i
think
it
should
already
be
clear
to
the
court
that
taliento
did
not
lie
at
all
in
this
trial.
i
think
when
the
court
granted
certiorari
in
this
case.
it
may
have
been
under
the
opinion
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
that
had
been
presented
to
it
and
the
petitioner
agreed
that
there
had
actually
been
perjury
committed
in
this
case
and
the
government
had
failed
to
correct
it
that
there
had
been
perjury
in
this
case
on
a
substantial
issue
if
government
had
failed
to
correct
it,
i
do
not
think
we
would
be
here.
but,
there
was
no
perjury
in
this
case.
what
happened
was
this.
that
the
grand
jury
hearing
was
two
years
ago,
a
week
before
the
case
comes
up
for
trial,
mr.
golden
begins
his
preparation
for
trial
us
attorney.
he
contacts
the
us
attorney
who
had
handled
the
case
and
the
grand
jury
asks
that
us
attorney
whether
any
immunity
or
promises
had
been
given
to
mr.
taliento
and
was
informed
that
taliento
had
not
been
indicted
because
he
was
a
young
man,
he
was
19
at
that
time
that
this
happened.
that
the
government
felt
that
he
had
been
over
reached
by
the
older
man,
giglio
who
really
can
get
into
this
later—set
up
the
whole
transaction.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
giglio
as
about
26
or
27
at
time.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
this
is
from
mr.
golden’s
affidavits.
and
however,
it
was
also
made
clear
mr.
golden
that
it
was
understood
that
taliento
would
be
a
witness
for
the
prosecution
and
that
was
also
a
reason
he
was
not
being
--
that
he
would
not
be
indited.
now,
with
this
in
mind,
mr.
golden
contacted
mr.
taliento,
the
witness.
mr.
taliento
told
mr.
golden
that
he
would
not
testify.
now,
if
there
had
been
any
agreement
before
hand
and
we
only
know
of
that
from
an
affidavit,
two-and-a
half
years
after
the
event,
that
if
there
was
any
agreement
before
hand
and
mr.
taliento
said
he
would
not
testify.
that
agreement
was
over.
now,
mr.
golden
asked
mr.
taliento,
i
would
be
coming
to
his
office
and
talk
to
him.
mr.
taliento
came
in.
he
came
in
with
his
father
and
mr.
taliento’s
father
said
“i
would
rather
have
my
son
alive
than
have
him
testify
and
he
is
not
going
to
testify
in
this
case”.
mr.
golden
then
set
up
a
meeting
with
mr.
darienzo
who
had
been
taliento’s
lawyer
at
the
time
of
the
grand
jury
proceedings
and
who
was
still
taliento’s
lawyer,
mr.
darienzo,
taliento’s
father
and
as
mr.
hoey,
the
us
attorney
himself
to
come
to
the
meeting.
and,
they
had
several
meetings
on
discussing
this
point
with
the
lawyer
--
everyone
involved.
the
result
of
these
meetings
was
that
whatever
had
been
done
before
was
made
perfectly
clear
to
mr.
taliento
that
if
he
did
not
testify,
he
could
still
be
indited
and
prosecuted.
and,
mr.
hoey
said
to
him,
he
should
have
been
and
could
be
still
prosecuted
if
he
would
not
testify.
it
was
also
made
clear
to
him
in
the
presence
of
his
lawyer
that
if
did
testify
and
here
i
think,
i
would
like
to
quote
mr.
hoey’s
affidavit
at
page
144a
said
“mr.
darienzo
did
not
claim
that
his
client
robert
taliento
received
immunity
or
was
made
any
promises.
no
assurances
were
given
to
mr.
darienzo
or
to
the
taliento’s
except
that
they
would
have
to
rely
on
the
good
judgment
and
conscience
of
the
government.”
so,
here
is
mr.
taliento,
the
witness
for
the
government,
going
into
trial.
it
was
perfectly
obvious
to
everyone
he
had
not
yet
been
indited.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
the
government
was
holding
over
mr.
taliento’s
head,
the
possibility
that
he
could
still
be
indicted
if
he
did
not
testify
or
if
he
got
up
and
instead
of
testifying
the
same
way
he
had
in
previous
times,
changes
his
testimony
to
make
it
more
favorable
to
the
defense.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
he
probably
did
not,
if
he
screwed
it
that
way
and
that
is
the
way—.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
what
it
was
was
something
less
than
a
promise,
but
certainly
an
indication
to
it.
that
if
he
testified,
the
likelyhood
was
that
he
would
not
be
prosecuted
and
mr.
taliento
testified
that
way.
he
was
questioned
as
to
whether
anyone
had
made
an
absolute
promise
to
him,
they
would
not
be
prosecuted,
and
he
said
no.
but
if
you
read
--
if
you
read
his
testimony,
he
made
it
pretty
clear
that
he
understood,
that
he
would
likely
not
to
be
prosecuted,
but
no
one
had
tended
down
kite
for
him.
you
know,
this
was
not
a
sec
registration,
this
was
a
scared
witness
testifying
in
a
trial,
being
cross
examined,
and
i
submit
that
if
the
court
knows
about
the
meetings
that
took
placed
before
this
trial
and
then
reasons
this
to
taliento’s
testimony,
all
mr.
taliento
was
doing
was
reflecting
what
mr.
hoey
had
said
to
him.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
do
not
think
there
is
far
apart
as
they
seem
--
you
keep
in
mind
the
context--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
now,
what
i
was
suggesting
your
honors
that
in
the
context
of
his
testimony,
he
is
there
on
trial
being
crossed
examined.
he
may
well
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
he
may
well
have
understood
this
to
be
question
as
to
whether
he
had
a
deal
with
the
government,
it
was
4,
5
pages
about
whether
he
had
a
deal
with
the
government,
and
he
did
not
try
do
deny
that
he
expected
that
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
he
also
had
within
the
week
before
his
testimony.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
explanation
from
the
us
attorney
that
no
promise
had
been
made.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
taliento
may
have
interpreted
whatever
had
been
said
to
him
two-and-a-half
years
before
differently
than
mr.
dipaola
interpreted
that.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
it
does.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
correct.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
less
than
perjury,
when
the
witness
has
spent
a
week
with
the
federal
attorneys
just
before
this
testimony
in
which
they
have
made
it
perfectly
clear
to
him
that
he
could
still
be
prosecuted,
and
he
have
had
--.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
but
they—
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
mr.
hoey
had
also
apparently
made
it
clear
to
him
that
even
if
he
did
testify,
he
would
simply
have
to
rely
on
the
good
faith
and
judgment
of
the
government.
what
i
have
in
mind
is
could
be
the
taliento
at
one
time
thought
he
had
an
absolute
promise.
but
that
after
this
week
of
discussions
with
the
federal
attorney,
he
would
no
longer
think
he
had
an
absolute
promise
because
they
told
him
that
he
did
not
have.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
do
no
think
the
district
court
saw
it
as
a
necessary
conflict
in
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
really
think
there
is
a
conflict.
that
dipaola
apparently
told
golden
that
he
had
made
no
promise
and
that
in
his
own
affidavit,
he
says
he
had
made
a
promise.
now,
whether
this
means
that
if
he
had
forgotten
it
and
remembered
it
again
or
whether
it
means
that
he
is
trying
to
get
more
definiteness
two-and-a-half
years
later
than
he
gave
at
the
time
of
the
trail
to
whatever
statements
were
made.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
really
do
not
think
so
your
honor.
because
i
think
even
if
we
take
this
case
at
the
worst
for
the
government,
where
you
would
have
an
absolute
promise
of
immunity
made
to
the
witness.
no
knowledge
of
that
by
the
government
lawyers
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
the
witness
assured
that
he
had
no
immunity.
the
witness
forgetting
or
thinking
that
his
prior
grant
was
no
longer
operated
and
stating
that
he
has
no
immunity
though
he
making
it
clear,
he
hopes
he
has
not
been
prosecuted
that
he
hopes
he
would
not
be
prosecuted.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
i
agree,
in
that
situation,
the
case
would
be
over.
there
would
be
no
question
at
all.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
that
is
right.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
right.
but
what
i
am
saying
is
even
if
dipaola’s
affidavit
is
accepted
as
absolutely
true,
i
do
not
think
that
there
was
any
perjury.
perhaps,
justice
stewart
sees
this
one
question
that
is
a
possibility
of
perhaps
perjury.
i
think
in
the
context
of
this
witness
testifying
in
that
trial
and
what
had
been
told
him
the
week
before,
at
worst,
it
was
an
incomplete
answer.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think—
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
this
court
should
--
unless
it
wants
to
send
the
case
back
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
that
this
court
should
accept
mr.
dipaola’s
statement
as
true.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
his
affidavit
as
true,
that
he
did
tell
taliento
that
he
would
not
prosecute
if
he
testified
at
the
trial.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
that
should
be
accepted
as
true
too
that
when
he
spoke
to
mr.
golden,
he
did
not
tell
mr.
golden
this.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
he
may
not
have
told
the
whole
truth.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
cannot
argue
strongly
against
a
man
for
finding
the
fact
in
this
case,
but
i
do
believe
that
even,
if
we
take
these
statements
at
their
worst
against
the
government.
what
we
presented
with
is
that
case
where
the
government
had
overwhelming
evidence
against
mr.
giglio.
a
case
in
which,
if
there
was
any
perjury
at
all,
doubtful
but
i
think
there
was
no
perjury.
a
case
in
which
if
there
was
any
government
misrepresentation,
it
was
honest
and
not
in
bad
faith.
the
case
in
which
the
likelihood
that
at
this
case
would
tried
over
on
the
merits,
the
result
would
come
out
any
different
way.
it
is
almost
nil,
and
the
two
facts
of
the
case
that
i
have
not
talked
about
that
--
i
think
i
should
mention.
first
is
that
mr.
taliento
gave
a
full
confession
when
he
was
caught
by
his
bank
officials
and
told
the
whole
story.
all
these
checks
went
through
his
window.
the
checks
had
been
supplied
in
by
mr.
giglio.
it
was
not
a
very
clever
scheme.
he
was
cashing
these
forged
traveler’s
checks.
the
computer
in
the
bank
in
california
where
the
checks
had
to
be
honored
kicked
them
all
out
as
stolen
checks
and
he
was
confronted
with
this
within
days.
and,
he
gave
the
whole
story
to
the
bank
officials
before
anyone
from
the
government
talked
to
him,
who
gave
him
any
promises.
the
bank
officials
then
that
very
night
told
in
the
fbi.
he
gave
the
same
story
to
the
fbi.
told
the
fbi
also
that
he
had
a
part
of
the
money
still
due
to
him
from
giglio,
told
the
fbi
where
giglio
could
be
found
and
went
with
the
fbi
and
they
found
giglio
with
the
money
in
his
pocket
$550.00
and
large
bills
which
approximately
the
amount
that
was
to
be
given
to
taliento.
there
is
no
real
risk
that
any
promises
of
immunity
one
way
or
the
other
would
have
affected
the
substance
of
this
testimony
in
cheat
because
it
was
all
fixed
before
any
of
these
happen.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes.
and
secondly,
that
second
point
on
that
is
this
jury
knew,
and
this
is
what
the
district
court
found.
i
think
the
district
court
opinion
is
a
wise
opinion.
this
jury
knew
the
whole
time
that
taliento
was
a
government’s
witness.
that
--
two
years
had
passed
and
he
had
not
been
indited?
that
if
he
testify
properly,
he
probably
never
would
be
indited.
the
defense
lawyer
spent
almost
this
whole
argument
on
the
fact
that
taliento
was
a
biased
witness.
there
is
nothing
that
would
be
added
by
the
fact
that
the
government
had
at
one
time
promised
immunity
and
then
taken
that
promise
back.
in
fact,
i—
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
true,
that
is
true.
but
whether
that,
this
was
argument
--
this
is
not
evidence
but
argument.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
other
than
taliento,
the
fact
that
the
fbi
went
out
found
giglio
where
he
was
suppose
to
be,
found
him
with
this
money
in
his
pocket,
and
that
giglio
presented
no
defense
at
all,
introduced
no
witnesses.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
is
no
evidence
your
honor
of
entrapment.
no
evidence
at
all.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
was
just
a
wholly
unfounded
argument
that
taliento
to
get
himself
off
the
book
would
try
to
bring
giglio
in.
but
the
evidence
--
there
is
no
evidence
today.
and,
there
is
no
reason
just
reading
what
happened
to
suspect
that
that
evidence
is
all
the
other
way
around
that
it
was
giglio’s
idea.
he
had
set
it
up.
it
was
not
a
very
great
idea
and
they
got
caught.
taliento
instead
of
being
a
good
solid
crook
keeping
it
all
to
himself
talked
and
the
problem
was
the
--
well,
the
problem
with
a
re-trial
in
this
case
that
ever
came
to
that
is
that
taliento
was
a
reluctant
witness
to
begin
with.
and
he
testified
and
there
is
no
evidence
that
he
testified
anyway
other
than
truthfully.
the
thing
that
would
be
bad
is
that
somehow,
the
pressure
got
to
him
and
would
not
testify
again.
and
instead
of
being
able
to
get
testimony
that
did
correspond
with
the
statements,
he
made
when
--
at
the
time
that
an
un-suspicious
time,
that
we
have
testimony
that
would
be
altered
to
now
try
to
help
his
friend.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
unless
he
disappeared,
that
could
be
done.
but
i
think
the
crux
of
the
case
now
say
this
and
sit
down
unless
there
are
some
further
questions
is
that
the
jury
knew
this
was
the
government’s
witness.
they
knew
everything
they
could
know
to
know
that
the
government
still
had
a
weight
hanging
over
his
head.
if
the
government
had
no
weight
of
hanging
over
his
head,
he
would
have
been
a
freer
witness
than
he
was,
as
things
turned
out.
further
that
giglio's
testimony
was
within
the
--
what
can
be
expected
of
a
hostile
witness
and
of
a
co-conspirator
in
a
criminal
trial
was
honest
testimony
as
to
what
he
had
been
promised
or
what
he
had
been
promised.
there
is
simply
nothing
in
this
case
that
raises
it
to
the
level
cases
like
brady
versus
maryland
and
napue
versus
illinois
where
there
was
real
evidence
that
might
have
changed
the
outcome
of
this
case,
and
where
prosecutor
had
suppressed
it
or
where
there
was
known
perjury
that
he
did
not
correct.
this
is
the
kind
of
case
that
i
believe
in
which
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
should
have
a
certain
amount
of
discretion
and
which
this
court
should
be
reluctant
to
undo
with
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
some
extent
we
were
closer
to
the
case.
both
found
was
correct.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
the
petitioner
began
by
giving
very
selective
view
of
the
facts
of
this
case,
thought
i
think
that
now,
most
of
facts
are
out
on
the
table
as
basis
of
the
questioning
in
the
last
five
or
10
minutes.
i
would
like
to
take
the
petitioner’s
contentions
in
this
order.
first,
the
petitioner
contends
that
the
government
witness
taliento
lied
and
truly
what
it
is.
he
did
not
tell
the
truth
to
the
court,
and
that
the
government
knowing
that
he
did
not
tell
the
truth
failed
to
correct,
and
the
petitioner
also
urges
that
the
case
was
in
some
way
shaky
anyway
with
this
taliento
was
the
only
witness
for
the
government.
i
want
to
start
with
that
second
point
first.
i
think
it
should
already
be
clear
to
the
court
that
taliento
did
not
lie
at
all
in
this
trial.
i
think
when
the
court
granted
certiorari
in
this
case.
it
may
have
been
under
the
opinion
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
that
had
been
presented
to
it
and
the
petitioner
agreed
that
there
had
actually
been
perjury
committed
in
this
case
and
the
government
had
failed
to
correct
it
that
there
had
been
perjury
in
this
case
on
a
substantial
issue
if
government
had
failed
to
correct
it,
i
do
not
think
we
would
be
here.
but,
there
was
no
perjury
in
this
case.
what
happened
was
this.
that
the
grand
jury
hearing
was
two
years
ago,
a
week
before
the
case
comes
up
for
trial,
mr.
golden
begins
his
preparation
for
trial
us
attorney.
he
contacts
the
us
attorney
who
had
handled
the
case
and
the
grand
jury
asks
that
us
attorney
whether
any
immunity
or
promises
had
been
given
to
mr.
taliento
and
was
informed
that
taliento
had
not
been
indicted
because
he
was
a
young
man,
he
was
19
at
that
time
that
this
happened.
that
the
government
felt
that
he
had
been
over
reached
by
the
older
man,
giglio
who
really
can
get
into
this
later—set
up
the
whole
transaction.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
giglio
as
about
26
or
27
at
time.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
this
is
from
mr.
golden’s
affidavits.
and
however,
it
was
also
made
clear
mr.
golden
that
it
was
understood
that
taliento
would
be
a
witness
for
the
prosecution
and
that
was
also
a
reason
he
was
not
being
--
that
he
would
not
be
indited.
now,
with
this
in
mind,
mr.
golden
contacted
mr.
taliento,
the
witness.
mr.
taliento
told
mr.
golden
that
he
would
not
testify.
now,
if
there
had
been
any
agreement
before
hand
and
we
only
know
of
that
from
an
affidavit,
two-and-a
half
years
after
the
event,
that
if
there
was
any
agreement
before
hand
and
mr.
taliento
said
he
would
not
testify.
that
agreement
was
over.
now,
mr.
golden
asked
mr.
taliento,
i
would
be
coming
to
his
office
and
talk
to
him.
mr.
taliento
came
in.
he
came
in
with
his
father
and
mr.
taliento’s
father
said
“i
would
rather
have
my
son
alive
than
have
him
testify
and
he
is
not
going
to
testify
in
this
case”.
mr.
golden
then
set
up
a
meeting
with
mr.
darienzo
who
had
been
taliento’s
lawyer
at
the
time
of
the
grand
jury
proceedings
and
who
was
still
taliento’s
lawyer,
mr.
darienzo,
taliento’s
father
and
as
mr.
hoey,
the
us
attorney
himself
to
come
to
the
meeting.
and,
they
had
several
meetings
on
discussing
this
point
with
the
lawyer
--
everyone
involved.
the
result
of
these
meetings
was
that
whatever
had
been
done
before
was
made
perfectly
clear
to
mr.
taliento
that
if
he
did
not
testify,
he
could
still
be
indited
and
prosecuted.
and,
mr.
hoey
said
to
him,
he
should
have
been
and
could
be
still
prosecuted
if
he
would
not
testify.
it
was
also
made
clear
to
him
in
the
presence
of
his
lawyer
that
if
did
testify
and
here
i
think,
i
would
like
to
quote
mr.
hoey’s
affidavit
at
page
144a
said
“mr.
darienzo
did
not
claim
that
his
client
robert
taliento
received
immunity
or
was
made
any
promises.
no
assurances
were
given
to
mr.
darienzo
or
to
the
taliento’s
except
that
they
would
have
to
rely
on
the
good
judgment
and
conscience
of
the
government.”
so,
here
is
mr.
taliento,
the
witness
for
the
government,
going
into
trial.
it
was
perfectly
obvious
to
everyone
he
had
not
yet
been
indited.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
the
government
was
holding
over
mr.
taliento’s
head,
the
possibility
that
he
could
still
be
indicted
if
he
did
not
testify
or
if
he
got
up
and
instead
of
testifying
the
same
way
he
had
in
previous
times,
changes
his
testimony
to
make
it
more
favorable
to
the
defense.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
he
probably
did
not,
if
he
screwed
it
that
way
and
that
is
the
way—.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
what
it
was
was
something
less
than
a
promise,
but
certainly
an
indication
to
it.
that
if
he
testified,
the
likelyhood
was
that
he
would
not
be
prosecuted
and
mr.
taliento
testified
that
way.
he
was
questioned
as
to
whether
anyone
had
made
an
absolute
promise
to
him,
they
would
not
be
prosecuted,
and
he
said
no.
but
if
you
read
--
if
you
read
his
testimony,
he
made
it
pretty
clear
that
he
understood,
that
he
would
likely
not
to
be
prosecuted,
but
no
one
had
tended
down
kite
for
him.
you
know,
this
was
not
a
sec
registration,
this
was
a
scared
witness
testifying
in
a
trial,
being
cross
examined,
and
i
submit
that
if
the
court
knows
about
the
meetings
that
took
placed
before
this
trial
and
then
reasons
this
to
taliento’s
testimony,
all
mr.
taliento
was
doing
was
reflecting
what
mr.
hoey
had
said
to
him.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
do
not
think
there
is
far
apart
as
they
seem
--
you
keep
in
mind
the
context--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
now,
what
i
was
suggesting
your
honors
that
in
the
context
of
his
testimony,
he
is
there
on
trial
being
crossed
examined.
he
may
well
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
he
may
well
have
understood
this
to
be
question
as
to
whether
he
had
a
deal
with
the
government,
it
was
4,
5
pages
about
whether
he
had
a
deal
with
the
government,
and
he
did
not
try
do
deny
that
he
expected
that
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
he
also
had
within
the
week
before
his
testimony.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
explanation
from
the
us
attorney
that
no
promise
had
been
made.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
taliento
may
have
interpreted
whatever
had
been
said
to
him
two-and-a-half
years
before
differently
than
mr.
dipaola
interpreted
that.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
it
does.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
correct.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
less
than
perjury,
when
the
witness
has
spent
a
week
with
the
federal
attorneys
just
before
this
testimony
in
which
they
have
made
it
perfectly
clear
to
him
that
he
could
still
be
prosecuted,
and
he
have
had
--.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
but
they—
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
mr.
hoey
had
also
apparently
made
it
clear
to
him
that
even
if
he
did
testify,
he
would
simply
have
to
rely
on
the
good
faith
and
judgment
of
the
government.
what
i
have
in
mind
is
could
be
the
taliento
at
one
time
thought
he
had
an
absolute
promise.
but
that
after
this
week
of
discussions
with
the
federal
attorney,
he
would
no
longer
think
he
had
an
absolute
promise
because
they
told
him
that
he
did
not
have.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
do
no
think
the
district
court
saw
it
as
a
necessary
conflict
in
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
really
think
there
is
a
conflict.
that
dipaola
apparently
told
golden
that
he
had
made
no
promise
and
that
in
his
own
affidavit,
he
says
he
had
made
a
promise.
now,
whether
this
means
that
if
he
had
forgotten
it
and
remembered
it
again
or
whether
it
means
that
he
is
trying
to
get
more
definiteness
two-and-a-half
years
later
than
he
gave
at
the
time
of
the
trail
to
whatever
statements
were
made.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
really
do
not
think
so
your
honor.
because
i
think
even
if
we
take
this
case
at
the
worst
for
the
government,
where
you
would
have
an
absolute
promise
of
immunity
made
to
the
witness.
no
knowledge
of
that
by
the
government
lawyers
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
the
witness
assured
that
he
had
no
immunity.
the
witness
forgetting
or
thinking
that
his
prior
grant
was
no
longer
operated
and
stating
that
he
has
no
immunity
though
he
making
it
clear,
he
hopes
he
has
not
been
prosecuted
that
he
hopes
he
would
not
be
prosecuted.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
i
agree,
in
that
situation,
the
case
would
be
over.
there
would
be
no
question
at
all.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
that
is
right.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
right.
but
what
i
am
saying
is
even
if
dipaola’s
affidavit
is
accepted
as
absolutely
true,
i
do
not
think
that
there
was
any
perjury.
perhaps,
justice
stewart
sees
this
one
question
that
is
a
possibility
of
perhaps
perjury.
i
think
in
the
context
of
this
witness
testifying
in
that
trial
and
what
had
been
told
him
the
week
before,
at
worst,
it
was
an
incomplete
answer.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think—
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
this
court
should
--
unless
it
wants
to
send
the
case
back
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
that
this
court
should
accept
mr.
dipaola’s
statement
as
true.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
his
affidavit
as
true,
that
he
did
tell
taliento
that
he
would
not
prosecute
if
he
testified
at
the
trial.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
that
should
be
accepted
as
true
too
that
when
he
spoke
to
mr.
golden,
he
did
not
tell
mr.
golden
this.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
he
may
not
have
told
the
whole
truth.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
cannot
argue
strongly
against
a
man
for
finding
the
fact
in
this
case,
but
i
do
believe
that
even,
if
we
take
these
statements
at
their
worst
against
the
government.
what
we
presented
with
is
that
case
where
the
government
had
overwhelming
evidence
against
mr.
giglio.
a
case
in
which,
if
there
was
any
perjury
at
all,
doubtful
but
i
think
there
was
no
perjury.
a
case
in
which
if
there
was
any
government
misrepresentation,
it
was
honest
and
not
in
bad
faith.
the
case
in
which
the
likelihood
that
at
this
case
would
tried
over
on
the
merits,
the
result
would
come
out
any
different
way.
it
is
almost
nil,
and
the
two
facts
of
the
case
that
i
have
not
talked
about
that
--
i
think
i
should
mention.
first
is
that
mr.
taliento
gave
a
full
confession
when
he
was
caught
by
his
bank
officials
and
told
the
whole
story.
all
these
checks
went
through
his
window.
the
checks
had
been
supplied
in
by
mr.
giglio.
it
was
not
a
very
clever
scheme.
he
was
cashing
these
forged
traveler’s
checks.
the
computer
in
the
bank
in
california
where
the
checks
had
to
be
honored
kicked
them
all
out
as
stolen
checks
and
he
was
confronted
with
this
within
days.
and,
he
gave
the
whole
story
to
the
bank
officials
before
anyone
from
the
government
talked
to
him,
who
gave
him
any
promises.
the
bank
officials
then
that
very
night
told
in
the
fbi.
he
gave
the
same
story
to
the
fbi.
told
the
fbi
also
that
he
had
a
part
of
the
money
still
due
to
him
from
giglio,
told
the
fbi
where
giglio
could
be
found
and
went
with
the
fbi
and
they
found
giglio
with
the
money
in
his
pocket
$550.00
and
large
bills
which
approximately
the
amount
that
was
to
be
given
to
taliento.
there
is
no
real
risk
that
any
promises
of
immunity
one
way
or
the
other
would
have
affected
the
substance
of
this
testimony
in
cheat
because
it
was
all
fixed
before
any
of
these
happen.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes.
and
secondly,
that
second
point
on
that
is
this
jury
knew,
and
this
is
what
the
district
court
found.
i
think
the
district
court
opinion
is
a
wise
opinion.
this
jury
knew
the
whole
time
that
taliento
was
a
government’s
witness.
that
--
two
years
had
passed
and
he
had
not
been
indited?
that
if
he
testify
properly,
he
probably
never
would
be
indited.
the
defense
lawyer
spent
almost
this
whole
argument
on
the
fact
that
taliento
was
a
biased
witness.
there
is
nothing
that
would
be
added
by
the
fact
that
the
government
had
at
one
time
promised
immunity
and
then
taken
that
promise
back.
in
fact,
i—
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
true,
that
is
true.
but
whether
that,
this
was
argument
--
this
is
not
evidence
but
argument.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
other
than
taliento,
the
fact
that
the
fbi
went
out
found
giglio
where
he
was
suppose
to
be,
found
him
with
this
money
in
his
pocket,
and
that
giglio
presented
no
defense
at
all,
introduced
no
witnesses.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
is
no
evidence
your
honor
of
entrapment.
no
evidence
at
all.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
was
just
a
wholly
unfounded
argument
that
taliento
to
get
himself
off
the
book
would
try
to
bring
giglio
in.
but
the
evidence
--
there
is
no
evidence
today.
and,
there
is
no
reason
just
reading
what
happened
to
suspect
that
that
evidence
is
all
the
other
way
around
that
it
was
giglio’s
idea.
he
had
set
it
up.
it
was
not
a
very
great
idea
and
they
got
caught.
taliento
instead
of
being
a
good
solid
crook
keeping
it
all
to
himself
talked
and
the
problem
was
the
--
well,
the
problem
with
a
re-trial
in
this
case
that
ever
came
to
that
is
that
taliento
was
a
reluctant
witness
to
begin
with.
and
he
testified
and
there
is
no
evidence
that
he
testified
anyway
other
than
truthfully.
the
thing
that
would
be
bad
is
that
somehow,
the
pressure
got
to
him
and
would
not
testify
again.
and
instead
of
being
able
to
get
testimony
that
did
correspond
with
the
statements,
he
made
when
--
at
the
time
that
an
un-suspicious
time,
that
we
have
testimony
that
would
be
altered
to
now
try
to
help
his
friend.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
unless
he
disappeared,
that
could
be
done.
but
i
think
the
crux
of
the
case
now
say
this
and
sit
down
unless
there
are
some
further
questions
is
that
the
jury
knew
this
was
the
government’s
witness.
they
knew
everything
they
could
know
to
know
that
the
government
still
had
a
weight
hanging
over
his
head.
if
the
government
had
no
weight
of
hanging
over
his
head,
he
would
have
been
a
freer
witness
than
he
was,
as
things
turned
out.
further
that
giglio's
testimony
was
within
the
--
what
can
be
expected
of
a
hostile
witness
and
of
a
co-conspirator
in
a
criminal
trial
was
honest
testimony
as
to
what
he
had
been
promised
or
what
he
had
been
promised.
there
is
simply
nothing
in
this
case
that
raises
it
to
the
level
cases
like
brady
versus
maryland
and
napue
versus
illinois
where
there
was
real
evidence
that
might
have
changed
the
outcome
of
this
case,
and
where
prosecutor
had
suppressed
it
or
where
there
was
known
perjury
that
he
did
not
correct.
this
is
the
kind
of
case
that
i
believe
in
which
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
should
have
a
certain
amount
of
discretion
and
which
this
court
should
be
reluctant
to
undo
with
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
some
extent
we
were
closer
to
the
case.
both
found
was
correct.
