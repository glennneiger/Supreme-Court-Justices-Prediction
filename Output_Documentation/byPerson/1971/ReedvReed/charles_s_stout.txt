mr.
charles
s.
stout
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
respondent
in
this
case
is
an
employee
of
the
state
highway
department
is
a
man
of
moderate
--
the
man
is
a
mechanic
and
he
is
about
ready
to
retire.
some
aspersions
have
been
cast
on
this
character
in
the
argument
that
sounded
like
to
me
and
also
in
the
brief.
he
is
a
man
of
good
character.
this
matter
was
determined
in
the
probate
court
of
idaho
on
adversary
petitions.
a
hearing
was
had
before
the
probate
judge
and
the
matter
was
open
for
all
the
testimony
as
to
the
qualifications
of
each
of
the
applicants.
now,
the
probate
judge
determined
that
the
scales
of
justice
were
even
on
the
mater
as
far
as
his
qualifications
were
concerned
then
under
the
statute
and
in
view
of
the
interpretation
to
the
law
as
interpreted
by
our
supreme
court
on
this
preference
statutes,
the
interpretation
that
has
been
made
for
a
period
of
a
hundred
and
twenty
five
years
over
that
time,
he
awarded
the
administration
to
the
male
applicant.
he
observed
in
his
opinion
that
the
woman
was
protected
by
the
order
and
that
it
qualified
by
giving
a
(inaudible)
then
she
is
protected
then
as
in
all
probate
proceedings,
all
of
the
(inaudible)
are
protected.
in
this
case
--
mr.
charles
s.
stout
what
was
that?
mr.
charles
s.
stout
that
was
an
adopted
child.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
s.
stout
they
are
what?
mr.
charles
s.
stout
they
were
divorced
in
1958.
mr.
charles
s.
stout
how
old
was
the
child?
mr.
charles
s.
stout
sixteen
years
old.
mr.
charles
s.
stout
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
stout
the
woman
filed
a
divorce
suit
against
her
husband.
the
district
court
awarded
the
divorce
to
the
husband.
the
court
awarded
the
child
which
is
at
tendered
years
to
the
woman.
the
probate
court
obeyed
culminated,
took
it
from
her
custody
and
put
it
in
a
children’s
home
for
a
time
and
then
gave
it
to
the
father
and
the
child
was
in
custody
of
the
father
at
the
time
of
his
death.
those
were
the
facts.
i
might
say
here
that
the
probate
court
in
idaho
at
the
time
this
was
decided
was
a
constitutional
court.
it
has
held
in
the
court
of
record
by
the
supreme
court.
however,
no
report
or
transcript
is
ordinarily
made
unless
the
attorneys
get
a
reporter
up
there
and
make
it
at
their
own
expense,
the
practice
is
not
to
make
one.
at
the
beginning
of
this
year
as
the
jurisdiction
was
transferred
to
the
district
court
under
a
new
judicial
code
we
have
there
of
which
is
the
court
of
general
jurisdiction
which
is
merely
background
and
had
really
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
except
that
is
the
history
of
the
matter.
in
our
brief
we
have
raised
two
questions,
one
of
which
is
to
whether
or
not
there
is
a
substantial
federal
question
involved
in
this
case.
the
second
one
assuming
that
the
court
hold
that
there
is,
it
is
our
position
that
this
particular
statute
is
not
unconstitutional
as
violating
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution.
mr.
charles
s.
stout
what
was
that
sir?
mr.
charles
s.
stout
i
do
not
believe
it
would
your
honor
because
we
are
talking
about
a
matter
of
procedure
that
is
always
--
that
is
only
incidental
to
the
distribution
of
property.
it
has
always
been
a
matter
that
has
been
legislated
on
by
the
states,
the
federal
legislation
sure
has
never
legislated
in
this
field
and
i
do
not
believe
it
would
of
course
--
mr.
charles
s.
stout
what
was
that?
mr.
charles
s.
stout
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
s.
stout
i
think
that
is
the
same
law
--
i
think
the
same
rule
would
be
applicable.
to
that
i
--
mr.
charles
s.
stout
no,
i
do
not.
mr.
charles
s.
stout
i
do
not
feel
that
would
make
a
protection
problem.
in
our
brief,
however,
we
considered
that
first
question
first
and
we
say
if
this
new
idaho
statute
which
was
adopted
in
1971,
in
the
last
session
of
the
legislature,
it
is
at
chapter
111
of
the
idaho
section
laws
of
1971,
it
has
got
a
lengthy
title.
it
is
lengthy
law.
i
have
studied
it
thoroughly
in
respect
to
the
issues
in
this
case.
it
is
an
act
relating
to
the
appearance
of
decedents
including
non-probate
transfers
at
death
of
missing
persons,
protected
persons,
minors,
incapacitated
persons
in
constituting
the
uniformed
probate
code.
now,
that
statute
enacts
an
entirely
new
probate
law
for
idaho.
the
controversy
was
not
over
the
statutes
that
we
are
arguing
about
here.
it
was
over
the
time
and
expense
involved
at
probate
proceedings
and
the
design
of
the
statute
is
to
avoid
the
proceedings
as
much
as
possible.
the
statute
does
enact
a
new
probate
law
and
thus
repeal
effective
next
at
july
1.
the
statutes
in
controversy
here.
now,
we
do
not
claim
that
that
makes
this
case
quickly
moot,
but
it
just
show
the
apparent
present
intent
and
add
it
to
the
idaho
legislature.
mr.
charles
s.
stout
what?
mr.
charles
s.
stout
no.
i
think
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
it.
i
--
mr.
charles
s.
stout
yes.
i
think
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
it.
it
has
been
under
consideration
for
several
years
there
and
i
did
not
know
it
was
until
i
got
investigating
it
in
this
matter
here
and
found
that
it
has.
mr.
charles
s.
stout
i
am
counsel
for
him,
yes,
and
i
represented
him
in
probate
court
and
at
the
time
of
the
hearing,
original
hearing
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
s.
stout
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
stout
it
has
not
because
i
thought
that
the
appeals
suspended
the
procedure
in
appropriate
court
and
i
was
not
authorized
to
file
one.
mr.
charles
s.
stout
that
is
what
i
understand
it
to
be.
mr.
charles
s.
stout
yes.
i
figure
that
stops
us
right
there
when
the
appeal
was
taken.
mr.
charles
s.
stout
i
am
not
sure
about
that.
the
notice
to
creditors
was
published
and
i
did
not
consider
that.
no
claims
were
filed.
however,
i
did
not
figure
that
we
were
justified
in
proceeding
in
the
matter
in
view
of
the
appeal
status
of
the
case.
mr.
charles
s.
stout
those
under
the
idaho
statutes
are
only
appointed
where
the
--
where
there
is
some
reason
for
it
like
property
that
is
liable
to
depreciate,
or
some
purpose.
no,
i
do
not
think
there
would
have
been.
there
was
really
no
reason
for
up
here.
there
was
nothing
that
would
depreciate
this
alleged
bank
account
that
is
referred
to
in
sally
reed’s
petition
and
also
personal
clothings
and
small
amount
of
personal
properties
that
a
minor
boy
of
that
age
would
have.
the
second
point
that
we
raised
under
that
is
the
--
is
the
holdings
of
this
court
--
holding
of
the
matter
of
probate
procedure.
it
is
a
matter
for
the
states
to
determine
and
the
federal
courts
have
never
as
such
probated
the
states
and
do
not
probate
states.
we
have
also
pointed
out
in
our
brief
that
this
particular
statute
was
enacted
in
1864,
by
the
first
territorial
legislature
in
idaho
that
has
been
in
effect
ever
since
that
time.
during
that
time
the
women
for
the
past
75
years
has
had
the
right
to
vote
and
could
have
changed
it.
it
would
have
been
changed
no
doubt
if
there
has
been
enough
interest
in
it.
we
had
a
similar
statute
in
idaho
that
disqualified
married
women.
it
was
enacted
in
the
same
law
--
statute
as
this,
1964.
it
was
deleted
50
years
ago.
in
our
briefs
we
have
cited
cases
upholding
the
statute.
these
preference
statutes
have
been
upheld
by
the
courts
every
time
they
have
come
before
the
courts
back
as
far
as
1845
in
new
york.
there
is
a
number
new
york
cases.
there
is
a
california
case.
there
is
two
montana
cases.
the
recent
idaho
case
and
the
constitutionality
has
never
been
questioned
before
this
particular
matter
here.
so
far
as
women
of
being
qualified
to
act
as
administrator
in
idaho,
they
are
qualified.
there
is
no
disqualification
there
except
this
one
statute
that
and
the
one
before
that
makes
these
classifications
and
that
were
--
when
other
things
are
equal
whether
there
is
this
preference.
mr.
charles
s.
stout
what?
mr.
charles
s.
stout
excuse
me
--
mr.
charles
s.
stout
yes.
that
would
be
right.
mr.
charles
s.
stout
as
the
court
--
the
court
inquired
about
the
basis
on
which
the
supreme
court
decision
was
made
and
i
will
quote
from
some
of
the
provisions
there.
this
court
had
before
said
that
the
priorities
established
by
the
code
15-312
are
mandatory,
leaving
no
room
for
discretion
by
the
court
in
the
appointment
of
administrators,
citing
an
idaho
case.
similarly
the
preference
given
to
male
by
the
code
15-314
is
also
mandatory.
the
statute
itself
says
that
males
must
be
preferred
to
females.
other
courts
construing
similar
provisions
have
also
held
that
the
preference
is
mandatory.
the
respondent
however
contends
that
idaho
code
15-314
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
equal
protection
clause.
it
is
well
settled
that
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
preclude
the
legislature
from
making
classification
and
drawing
distinction
between
classes.
it
merely
prohibits
classifications
which
are
arbitrary
and
capricious.
it
is
for
the
court
to
determine
in
each
instance
whether
a
particular
classification
rests
upon
rational
ground
for
as
in
effect
without
justification
and
arbitrary.
it
is
equally
well
settled
that
legislative
enactments
are
entitled
to
a
presumption
of
validity
and
that
a
classification
will
not
be
held
unconstitutional
absent
a
clear
showing
that
is
arbitrary
and
without
justification.
by
idaho
code
15-314
the
legislature
eliminated
two
areas
or
controversy.
if
both
a
man
and
woman
of
the
same
class
seek
administration,
the
male
would
be
entitled
over
the
female.
the
same
as
relative
of
the
whole
blood
is
entitled
over
relative
of
the
same
class
but
of
only
the
half
blood.
the
provision
of
the
statute
is
neither
illogical
nor
arbitrary
method
devised
by
the
legislature
to
resolve
an
issue
that
would
otherwise
require
a
hearing
as
to
the
realty
of
merits
as
to
which
of
the
two
or
more
petitioning
relatives
should
be
appointed.
philosophically,
it
can
be
argued
with
some
degree
of
logic
that
the
provisions
of
idaho
code
15-314
discriminates
against
women
on
the
basis
of
sex.
however,
nature
itself
has
established
distinction
and
this
statute
is
not
designed
to
discriminate,
but
it
is
only
designed
to
alleviate
the
problem
of
holding
hearings
by
the
courts
to
determine
eligibility
to
administer.
this
is
one
of
those
areas
where
a
trust
must
be
made
in
a
legislature
about
enacting
idaho
code
15-314,
make
a
determination.
legislature
when
enacted
this
statute
evidently
concluded
that
in
general
men
are
better
qualified
to
act
as
an
administrator
than
are
women.
a
classification
having
some
reasonable
basis
does
not
offend
against
that
clause
of
equal
protection,
merely
because
it
is
not
made
with
mathematical
necessity
or
because
in
practice
it
results
in
some
inequality.
on
even
scale
of
the
classification,
such
a
law
must
carry
the
burden
of
showing
that
it
does
not
rest
upon
an
unreasonable
basis
but
it
is
essentially
arbitrary.
and
they
go
on
to
say
that
while
a
classification
may
not
be
entirely
accurate
and
there
are
doubtless
instances
in
which
it
is
incorrect.
they
are
not
prepared
to
say
it
is
so
completely
out
of
basis
of
fact
as
to
be
irrational
or
arbitrary.
then
they
go
on
to
show
what
other
classifications
on
the
basis
of
sex
have
been
made.
it
is
our
opinion,
the
state
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
promoting
the
prompt
administration
of
the
estates
and
that
the
statute
in
question
promotes
this
interest
by
curtailing
litigation
over
the
appointment
of
administrators
in
addition
to
the
support
by
the
presumption
of
constitutionality.
appellant
in
its
brief
has
criticized
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
and
in
his
words,
misquotes
to
say
declaring
that
nature
itself
has
established
the
distinction,
the
idaho
supreme
court
seemly
justified
the
discrimination
challenged
here
by
finding
it
rationally
--
rational
to
assume
the
mental
inferiority
of
women
to
men.
well,
they
rolled
in
the
mental.
there
is
no
statement
in
the
supreme
court
decision
like
that
and
a
court
does
not
think
that.
mr.
charles
s.
stout
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
stout
in
some
absences,
yes.
it
does
not
--
mr.
charles
s.
stout
i
think
that
is
correct,
in
the
absence
of
some
disqualification
on
the
part
of
the
man.
mr.
charles
s.
stout
we
urge
that
this
statute
has
been
in
effect
for
over
125
years.
it
has
been
in
effect
over
a
hundred
years
in
idaho.
it
has
been
applied
by
the
courts.
the
attorneys
have
followed
it
and
applied
it.
i
am
a
general
practitioner.
my
business
is
to
advice
clients
as
to
what
the
law
is,
what
to
expect.
and
by
reason
of
the
decisions
heretofore
made
on
this
law,
it
was
reasonable
to
me
to
assume
that
i
was
justified
in
going
ahead
on
the
basis
i
did.
now,
the
legislature
show
that
same
intention
to
comply
and
to
enact
a
statute
here
that
more
adequately,
possibly
reflects
modern
thought.
now,
that
will
give
the
attorney
some
basis
to
go
ahead
on
and
the
people
some
basis
to
proceed
on.
mr.
charles
s.
stout
i
think
there
is
a
presumption
there
that
--
mr.
charles
s.
stout
no,
i
think
that
is
correct,
yes.
i
think
there
is
presumption
there
based
on
the
general
experience
which
existed
more
at
the
time
the
statute
was
enacted
in
1964
than
it
does
now,
that
men
as
a
rule
are
better
qualified
than
women
and
on
that
basis
the
court
did
not
held
a
hearing
on
that
particular
phase
of
it.
as
i
say
the
length
of
the
time
the
statutes
had
been
in
effect
and
had
been
followed,
it
seems
to
me,
it
should
take
a
very
strong
case
under
this
uncertain
and
elusive
provision
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
declare
it
unconstitutional.
it
has
been
acted
on.
the
attorneys
have
acted
on
it.
it
has
been
useful.
i
do
not
say
that
it
is
any
better
classification
than
there
is
in
this
new
law,
maybe
it
is
not
as
good
if
attorneys
will
follow
the
new
law.
in
this
case,
i
just
want
to
point
out
one
more
thing
and
that
is
that
the
respondent
had
been
quite
disadvantaged
in
this
case
by
lack
of
funds
and
not
anything
involved
in
the
estate
and
he
will
receive
--
received
the
bill
for
pending
the
appendix,
almost
three
hundred
dollars
which
was
up
three
times
of
what
it
cost
cecil.
and
extensive
briefs
have
been
filed
in
our
position
to
respondent.
we
do
not
urge
that
as
a
matter
of
law
here,
but
we
do
point
out
and
as
a
matter
of
law
we
do
think
that
the
court
should
dismiss
this
case
or
affirm
the
decision
of
the
idaho
supreme
court.
mr.
charles
s.
stout
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
respondent
in
this
case
is
an
employee
of
the
state
highway
department
is
a
man
of
moderate
--
the
man
is
a
mechanic
and
he
is
about
ready
to
retire.
some
aspersions
have
been
cast
on
this
character
in
the
argument
that
sounded
like
to
me
and
also
in
the
brief.
he
is
a
man
of
good
character.
this
matter
was
determined
in
the
probate
court
of
idaho
on
adversary
petitions.
a
hearing
was
had
before
the
probate
judge
and
the
matter
was
open
for
all
the
testimony
as
to
the
qualifications
of
each
of
the
applicants.
now,
the
probate
judge
determined
that
the
scales
of
justice
were
even
on
the
mater
as
far
as
his
qualifications
were
concerned
then
under
the
statute
and
in
view
of
the
interpretation
to
the
law
as
interpreted
by
our
supreme
court
on
this
preference
statutes,
the
interpretation
that
has
been
made
for
a
period
of
a
hundred
and
twenty
five
years
over
that
time,
he
awarded
the
administration
to
the
male
applicant.
he
observed
in
his
opinion
that
the
woman
was
protected
by
the
order
and
that
it
qualified
by
giving
a
(inaudible)
then
she
is
protected
then
as
in
all
probate
proceedings,
all
of
the
(inaudible)
are
protected.
in
this
case
--
mr.
charles
s.
stout
what
was
that?
mr.
charles
s.
stout
that
was
an
adopted
child.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
s.
stout
they
are
what?
mr.
charles
s.
stout
they
were
divorced
in
1958.
mr.
charles
s.
stout
how
old
was
the
child?
mr.
charles
s.
stout
sixteen
years
old.
mr.
charles
s.
stout
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
stout
the
woman
filed
a
divorce
suit
against
her
husband.
the
district
court
awarded
the
divorce
to
the
husband.
the
court
awarded
the
child
which
is
at
tendered
years
to
the
woman.
the
probate
court
obeyed
culminated,
took
it
from
her
custody
and
put
it
in
a
children’s
home
for
a
time
and
then
gave
it
to
the
father
and
the
child
was
in
custody
of
the
father
at
the
time
of
his
death.
those
were
the
facts.
i
might
say
here
that
the
probate
court
in
idaho
at
the
time
this
was
decided
was
a
constitutional
court.
it
has
held
in
the
court
of
record
by
the
supreme
court.
however,
no
report
or
transcript
is
ordinarily
made
unless
the
attorneys
get
a
reporter
up
there
and
make
it
at
their
own
expense,
the
practice
is
not
to
make
one.
at
the
beginning
of
this
year
as
the
jurisdiction
was
transferred
to
the
district
court
under
a
new
judicial
code
we
have
there
of
which
is
the
court
of
general
jurisdiction
which
is
merely
background
and
had
really
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
except
that
is
the
history
of
the
matter.
in
our
brief
we
have
raised
two
questions,
one
of
which
is
to
whether
or
not
there
is
a
substantial
federal
question
involved
in
this
case.
the
second
one
assuming
that
the
court
hold
that
there
is,
it
is
our
position
that
this
particular
statute
is
not
unconstitutional
as
violating
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution.
mr.
charles
s.
stout
what
was
that
sir?
mr.
charles
s.
stout
i
do
not
believe
it
would
your
honor
because
we
are
talking
about
a
matter
of
procedure
that
is
always
--
that
is
only
incidental
to
the
distribution
of
property.
it
has
always
been
a
matter
that
has
been
legislated
on
by
the
states,
the
federal
legislation
sure
has
never
legislated
in
this
field
and
i
do
not
believe
it
would
of
course
--
mr.
charles
s.
stout
what
was
that?
mr.
charles
s.
stout
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
s.
stout
i
think
that
is
the
same
law
--
i
think
the
same
rule
would
be
applicable.
to
that
i
--
mr.
charles
s.
stout
no,
i
do
not.
mr.
charles
s.
stout
i
do
not
feel
that
would
make
a
protection
problem.
in
our
brief,
however,
we
considered
that
first
question
first
and
we
say
if
this
new
idaho
statute
which
was
adopted
in
1971,
in
the
last
session
of
the
legislature,
it
is
at
chapter
111
of
the
idaho
section
laws
of
1971,
it
has
got
a
lengthy
title.
it
is
lengthy
law.
i
have
studied
it
thoroughly
in
respect
to
the
issues
in
this
case.
it
is
an
act
relating
to
the
appearance
of
decedents
including
non-probate
transfers
at
death
of
missing
persons,
protected
persons,
minors,
incapacitated
persons
in
constituting
the
uniformed
probate
code.
now,
that
statute
enacts
an
entirely
new
probate
law
for
idaho.
the
controversy
was
not
over
the
statutes
that
we
are
arguing
about
here.
it
was
over
the
time
and
expense
involved
at
probate
proceedings
and
the
design
of
the
statute
is
to
avoid
the
proceedings
as
much
as
possible.
the
statute
does
enact
a
new
probate
law
and
thus
repeal
effective
next
at
july
1.
the
statutes
in
controversy
here.
now,
we
do
not
claim
that
that
makes
this
case
quickly
moot,
but
it
just
show
the
apparent
present
intent
and
add
it
to
the
idaho
legislature.
mr.
charles
s.
stout
what?
mr.
charles
s.
stout
no.
i
think
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
it.
i
--
mr.
charles
s.
stout
yes.
i
think
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
it.
it
has
been
under
consideration
for
several
years
there
and
i
did
not
know
it
was
until
i
got
investigating
it
in
this
matter
here
and
found
that
it
has.
mr.
charles
s.
stout
i
am
counsel
for
him,
yes,
and
i
represented
him
in
probate
court
and
at
the
time
of
the
hearing,
original
hearing
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
s.
stout
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
stout
it
has
not
because
i
thought
that
the
appeals
suspended
the
procedure
in
appropriate
court
and
i
was
not
authorized
to
file
one.
mr.
charles
s.
stout
that
is
what
i
understand
it
to
be.
mr.
charles
s.
stout
yes.
i
figure
that
stops
us
right
there
when
the
appeal
was
taken.
mr.
charles
s.
stout
i
am
not
sure
about
that.
the
notice
to
creditors
was
published
and
i
did
not
consider
that.
no
claims
were
filed.
however,
i
did
not
figure
that
we
were
justified
in
proceeding
in
the
matter
in
view
of
the
appeal
status
of
the
case.
mr.
charles
s.
stout
those
under
the
idaho
statutes
are
only
appointed
where
the
--
where
there
is
some
reason
for
it
like
property
that
is
liable
to
depreciate,
or
some
purpose.
no,
i
do
not
think
there
would
have
been.
there
was
really
no
reason
for
up
here.
there
was
nothing
that
would
depreciate
this
alleged
bank
account
that
is
referred
to
in
sally
reed’s
petition
and
also
personal
clothings
and
small
amount
of
personal
properties
that
a
minor
boy
of
that
age
would
have.
the
second
point
that
we
raised
under
that
is
the
--
is
the
holdings
of
this
court
--
holding
of
the
matter
of
probate
procedure.
it
is
a
matter
for
the
states
to
determine
and
the
federal
courts
have
never
as
such
probated
the
states
and
do
not
probate
states.
we
have
also
pointed
out
in
our
brief
that
this
particular
statute
was
enacted
in
1864,
by
the
first
territorial
legislature
in
idaho
that
has
been
in
effect
ever
since
that
time.
during
that
time
the
women
for
the
past
75
years
has
had
the
right
to
vote
and
could
have
changed
it.
it
would
have
been
changed
no
doubt
if
there
has
been
enough
interest
in
it.
we
had
a
similar
statute
in
idaho
that
disqualified
married
women.
it
was
enacted
in
the
same
law
--
statute
as
this,
1964.
it
was
deleted
50
years
ago.
in
our
briefs
we
have
cited
cases
upholding
the
statute.
these
preference
statutes
have
been
upheld
by
the
courts
every
time
they
have
come
before
the
courts
back
as
far
as
1845
in
new
york.
there
is
a
number
new
york
cases.
there
is
a
california
case.
there
is
two
montana
cases.
the
recent
idaho
case
and
the
constitutionality
has
never
been
questioned
before
this
particular
matter
here.
so
far
as
women
of
being
qualified
to
act
as
administrator
in
idaho,
they
are
qualified.
there
is
no
disqualification
there
except
this
one
statute
that
and
the
one
before
that
makes
these
classifications
and
that
were
--
when
other
things
are
equal
whether
there
is
this
preference.
mr.
charles
s.
stout
what?
mr.
charles
s.
stout
excuse
me
--
mr.
charles
s.
stout
yes.
that
would
be
right.
mr.
charles
s.
stout
as
the
court
--
the
court
inquired
about
the
basis
on
which
the
supreme
court
decision
was
made
and
i
will
quote
from
some
of
the
provisions
there.
this
court
had
before
said
that
the
priorities
established
by
the
code
15-312
are
mandatory,
leaving
no
room
for
discretion
by
the
court
in
the
appointment
of
administrators,
citing
an
idaho
case.
similarly
the
preference
given
to
male
by
the
code
15-314
is
also
mandatory.
the
statute
itself
says
that
males
must
be
preferred
to
females.
other
courts
construing
similar
provisions
have
also
held
that
the
preference
is
mandatory.
the
respondent
however
contends
that
idaho
code
15-314
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
equal
protection
clause.
it
is
well
settled
that
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
preclude
the
legislature
from
making
classification
and
drawing
distinction
between
classes.
it
merely
prohibits
classifications
which
are
arbitrary
and
capricious.
it
is
for
the
court
to
determine
in
each
instance
whether
a
particular
classification
rests
upon
rational
ground
for
as
in
effect
without
justification
and
arbitrary.
it
is
equally
well
settled
that
legislative
enactments
are
entitled
to
a
presumption
of
validity
and
that
a
classification
will
not
be
held
unconstitutional
absent
a
clear
showing
that
is
arbitrary
and
without
justification.
by
idaho
code
15-314
the
legislature
eliminated
two
areas
or
controversy.
if
both
a
man
and
woman
of
the
same
class
seek
administration,
the
male
would
be
entitled
over
the
female.
the
same
as
relative
of
the
whole
blood
is
entitled
over
relative
of
the
same
class
but
of
only
the
half
blood.
the
provision
of
the
statute
is
neither
illogical
nor
arbitrary
method
devised
by
the
legislature
to
resolve
an
issue
that
would
otherwise
require
a
hearing
as
to
the
realty
of
merits
as
to
which
of
the
two
or
more
petitioning
relatives
should
be
appointed.
philosophically,
it
can
be
argued
with
some
degree
of
logic
that
the
provisions
of
idaho
code
15-314
discriminates
against
women
on
the
basis
of
sex.
however,
nature
itself
has
established
distinction
and
this
statute
is
not
designed
to
discriminate,
but
it
is
only
designed
to
alleviate
the
problem
of
holding
hearings
by
the
courts
to
determine
eligibility
to
administer.
this
is
one
of
those
areas
where
a
trust
must
be
made
in
a
legislature
about
enacting
idaho
code
15-314,
make
a
determination.
legislature
when
enacted
this
statute
evidently
concluded
that
in
general
men
are
better
qualified
to
act
as
an
administrator
than
are
women.
a
classification
having
some
reasonable
basis
does
not
offend
against
that
clause
of
equal
protection,
merely
because
it
is
not
made
with
mathematical
necessity
or
because
in
practice
it
results
in
some
inequality.
on
even
scale
of
the
classification,
such
a
law
must
carry
the
burden
of
showing
that
it
does
not
rest
upon
an
unreasonable
basis
but
it
is
essentially
arbitrary.
and
they
go
on
to
say
that
while
a
classification
may
not
be
entirely
accurate
and
there
are
doubtless
instances
in
which
it
is
incorrect.
they
are
not
prepared
to
say
it
is
so
completely
out
of
basis
of
fact
as
to
be
irrational
or
arbitrary.
then
they
go
on
to
show
what
other
classifications
on
the
basis
of
sex
have
been
made.
it
is
our
opinion,
the
state
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
promoting
the
prompt
administration
of
the
estates
and
that
the
statute
in
question
promotes
this
interest
by
curtailing
litigation
over
the
appointment
of
administrators
in
addition
to
the
support
by
the
presumption
of
constitutionality.
appellant
in
its
brief
has
criticized
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
and
in
his
words,
misquotes
to
say
declaring
that
nature
itself
has
established
the
distinction,
the
idaho
supreme
court
seemly
justified
the
discrimination
challenged
here
by
finding
it
rationally
--
rational
to
assume
the
mental
inferiority
of
women
to
men.
well,
they
rolled
in
the
mental.
there
is
no
statement
in
the
supreme
court
decision
like
that
and
a
court
does
not
think
that.
mr.
charles
s.
stout
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
stout
in
some
absences,
yes.
it
does
not
--
mr.
charles
s.
stout
i
think
that
is
correct,
in
the
absence
of
some
disqualification
on
the
part
of
the
man.
mr.
charles
s.
stout
we
urge
that
this
statute
has
been
in
effect
for
over
125
years.
it
has
been
in
effect
over
a
hundred
years
in
idaho.
it
has
been
applied
by
the
courts.
the
attorneys
have
followed
it
and
applied
it.
i
am
a
general
practitioner.
my
business
is
to
advice
clients
as
to
what
the
law
is,
what
to
expect.
and
by
reason
of
the
decisions
heretofore
made
on
this
law,
it
was
reasonable
to
me
to
assume
that
i
was
justified
in
going
ahead
on
the
basis
i
did.
now,
the
legislature
show
that
same
intention
to
comply
and
to
enact
a
statute
here
that
more
adequately,
possibly
reflects
modern
thought.
now,
that
will
give
the
attorney
some
basis
to
go
ahead
on
and
the
people
some
basis
to
proceed
on.
mr.
charles
s.
stout
i
think
there
is
a
presumption
there
that
--
mr.
charles
s.
stout
no,
i
think
that
is
correct,
yes.
i
think
there
is
presumption
there
based
on
the
general
experience
which
existed
more
at
the
time
the
statute
was
enacted
in
1964
than
it
does
now,
that
men
as
a
rule
are
better
qualified
than
women
and
on
that
basis
the
court
did
not
held
a
hearing
on
that
particular
phase
of
it.
as
i
say
the
length
of
the
time
the
statutes
had
been
in
effect
and
had
been
followed,
it
seems
to
me,
it
should
take
a
very
strong
case
under
this
uncertain
and
elusive
provision
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
declare
it
unconstitutional.
it
has
been
acted
on.
the
attorneys
have
acted
on
it.
it
has
been
useful.
i
do
not
say
that
it
is
any
better
classification
than
there
is
in
this
new
law,
maybe
it
is
not
as
good
if
attorneys
will
follow
the
new
law.
in
this
case,
i
just
want
to
point
out
one
more
thing
and
that
is
that
the
respondent
had
been
quite
disadvantaged
in
this
case
by
lack
of
funds
and
not
anything
involved
in
the
estate
and
he
will
receive
--
received
the
bill
for
pending
the
appendix,
almost
three
hundred
dollars
which
was
up
three
times
of
what
it
cost
cecil.
and
extensive
briefs
have
been
filed
in
our
position
to
respondent.
we
do
not
urge
that
as
a
matter
of
law
here,
but
we
do
point
out
and
as
a
matter
of
law
we
do
think
that
the
court
should
dismiss
this
case
or
affirm
the
decision
of
the
idaho
supreme
court.
