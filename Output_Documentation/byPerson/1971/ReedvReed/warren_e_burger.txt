mr.

oh,
excuse
me,
your
friend
is
not
quite
here
yet.
you
may
proceed.
let
me
put
a
question
to
you
at
the
outset.
this
is
--
the
statute
under
which
this
case
comes
here
has
now
been
superseded,
is
that
correct,
by
a
new
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
as
of
july
next
year,
1972,
the
new
legislation
would
washout
this
problem,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
plain
discrimination.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
alleged
discrimination.
i
just
want
to
be
sure
that
i
have
that
clearly
in
mind.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
say
you
did
not
get
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
could
not
--
i
do
not
think
i
have
got
this
clear
yet,
some
confusion
on
the
aspect.
what
was
to
prevent
you
from
presenting
the
issue
to
the
court
as
an
issue
that
the
wife
was
better
qualified,
anything
except
the
statute
and
its
mandatory
preference,
in
your
way?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
was
a
hearing,
before
the
probate
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
may
continue
mr.
derr.
you
have
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
twenty
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
statute
perhaps
not
to
be
read
as
meaning
in
practical
terms
otherwise
equally
eligible?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
otherwise
equally
eligible
then
the
male
is
preferred
over
the
female?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
that
does
not
get
into
this
case,
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
a
state
had
a
statute
that
provided
that
several
persons
claiming
and
otherwise
equally
eligible
to
administer,
natural
born
children
shall
be
preferred
over
adopted
children?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
not
think
that
would
be
bad
if
i
try
and
follow
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
fourteenth
amendment
forbid
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you
mean
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
aided
by
the
statutes
of
idaho
would
make
it
constitutional,
is
that
your
answer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
that
not
be
equally
true
with
adopted
children,
(inaudible)
back
into
it
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
neither
have
to
be
given
the
same
treatments
or
else
your
argument
just
tolled?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
derr.
mr.
stout.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
while
you
are
thinking
on
that,
then
let
us
take
the
more
interesting
question.
what
if
the
idaho
legislature
provided
that
only
females
could
be
administrators
or
representatives
in
the
estate
of
decedents
or
that
they
would
be
preferred?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
simply
say
that
is
not
an
equal
protection
problem?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
a
state
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
this
had
been
a
large
estate,
substantial
investments,
could
you
have
had
a
special
representative
appointed
in
the
interim
to
deal
with
problems
pending
the
resolution
of
the
appeal?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
mr.
stout.
you
have
two
minutes
left
mr.
derr.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
of
course
by
now
the
estate
is
long
since
been
consumed
by
the
cost
of
litigation,
although
i
suppose
that
is
not
relevant?
chief
justice
warren
e.

thank
you
mr.

your
mr.
