justice

because
it
does
equally

then
you
might
say
that
before
the
statute
makes
the
choice
there
would
have
to
be
a
hearing
as
to
what
the
respective
qualifications
are
for
these
two
people

it
would
only
be
when
they
are
found
to
be
absolutely
equally
qualified

that
the

the

i

excuse
me,
let

now
that
two

applying
there
in

you

then
one
of

claims
that
the

mentally

there

i

what
about
the

case
then?
justice

--
let

assume
one
person
says
the
other
person
is
deaf

dumb

just
or
he
is
paralyzed
or
something
like
that
and
he
is
unqualified
to
act
as
an
administrator

executor.
justice

what
if
the

to

a

he
claims
here
that
the

paralyzed

i
get
the
appointment
anyway

i
am
in

no,
it

so
the

anything?
justice

well,
mr.

i
take
it
from
the
passages
you
read
in
your
court
opinion

justice

--
that
you
would
agree
that
under

idaho

the
purpose

the
statute
is
to
avoid
hearings
about
relative
qualification.

i

just
had
a

of

under

if
the
woman
were
better

she
