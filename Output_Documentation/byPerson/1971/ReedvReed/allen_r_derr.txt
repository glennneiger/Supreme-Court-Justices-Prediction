derr
it
has
not
yet
been
superseded.
earlier
this
year
mr.
chief
justice,
the
idaho
supreme
court
enacted
a
uniform
probate
act.
now
this
act
does
not
contain
this
preference
statute
that
we
are
talking
about
in
this
case.
that
act
does
not
come
into
effect
until
july
of
next
year.
mr.

it
does
remove
the
distinction

mr.

yes.
mr.

derr
right.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
no.
i
believe
that
in
respondent’s
brief
they
raise
the
question,
but
i
take
the
position
that
we
had
a
state
supreme
court
decision
that
we
are
here
on
that
the
law
is
still
in
effect
and
will
be
until
july

mr.

no,
she
is

mr.

that
is
right,
unless
she
can
get
relief
here.
mr.
allen

derr
i
do
not
think
it
is
at
all.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
i
just
thought
--
mr.
allen
r.
derr
we
do
not
know
for
sure,
your
honor.
the
exact
size
of
the
estate,
but
i
will
have
to
concede
that
it
must
be
a
small
estate.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
basically,
except
that
it
is
also
a
matter
of
principle
on
behalf
of
mrs.
reed.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
if
they
--
mr.
allen
r.
derr
the
reeds
although,
it
does
not
appear
in
the
record
your
honor,
the
reeds
have
been
divorced
since
1958.
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
here
today
to
ask
you
to
do
something
that
this
court
has
never
done
since
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
adopted
in
1868
and
that
is
to
declare
a
state
statute
that
distinguishes
between
--
that
classifies
between
males
and
females
as
unconstitutional.
we
feel
that
the
case
could
have
us
--
at
least
a
significant,
significant
for
women,
somewhat
it
can
to
what
ground
as
board
of
education
had
for
the
butter
--
mr.
allen
r.
derr
if
the
court
please,
that
was
the
goesaert
case
that
you
are
talking
about
sir.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
that
case
was
decided,
your
honor
on
a
premise
that
we
feel
is
no
longer
tenable.
it
allowed
the
wife
or
daughter
of
an
owner
to
tend
bar
that
no
other
women
to
tend
bar.
it
seems
that
it
had
been
felt
by
the
court
that
if
the
wife,
the
wife
or
daughter
would
be
protected
by
the
husband
or
father
and
that
for
other
reason
there
was
a
rational
relationship
to
a
legitimate
state
purpose.
and
as
rational
relationship
test
that
has
followed
through
our
law
had
given
some
indication
that
wherever
there
has
been
a
classification
on
the
basis
of
sex,
anything
goes,
it
is
alright.
and
we
admit
they
are
different,
but
we
do
feel
as
a
result
of
this
rational
relationship
test
is
almost
as
they
enter
it
is
separate
but
equal
test
that
(inaudible)
in
holding
that
--
holding
that
women
from
being
considered
person
and
holding
them
back
from
their
entitlement
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution,
the
equal
protection
clause.
now,
a
just
brief
run
down
on
the
facts
of
this
case
which
might
be
helpful
in
our
analyzing
that
--
mr.
allen
r.
derr
there
is
a
serious
question
on
my
mind
because
of
the
mandatory
provisions
and
our
supreme
court
in
the
case
we
are
appealing
from
is
that
that
provision
is
mandatory.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
i
have
known
them
personally
and
in
fact
this
has
been
so
except
by
ascent
and
never
in
this
type
of
equal
relationship.
i
have
had
a
brother
and
sister
agree
with
each
other.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
any
kind,
a
male
contender
appears
under
the
statute,
the
language
of
the
statute
is
clear.
males
must
be
preferred
to
be,
there
is
no
discretion.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
i
would
think
that
the
interpretation
that
was
given
to
this
case
is
the
interpretation
that
might
be
given
by
other
courts
and
that
no,
they
would
not
appoint
both.
mr.

the
statute
is
mandatory,
but
i
am
not
closing
the
door
to
someone
being
able
to
have
a
hearing
but
let
me
run
down
the
only
other
disqualification
in
our
statute,
non-residence,
minors,
persons
convicted
of
infamous
crime
and
persons
incompetent
by
reason
of
drunkenness,
and
providence
or
one

those
are
defined.
mr.

it

claimed.
mr.

mr.
allen

derr
no,
we
did
not
because
we
felt
that
our
client
was
better,
my
client
was
better
qualified
to
administer
the
estate
for
many
reasons.
none
of
these
particular
disqualifications
came
into
play.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
we
had
no
opportunity
to.
we
petitioned.
the
husband
petitioned.
the
judge
issued
his
order
because
of
this
law
in
idaho,
the
man
gets
the
job.
we
did
not
get
that
in
the
record.
we
did
not
get
the
chance
to
show
our
client
was
better
educated,
that
she
had
bookkeeping
experience,
that
she
had
secretarial
experience.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
no,
your
honor.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
the
statute
and
its
mandatory
preference
was
imposed
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
do
not
think
there
would
be
a
hearing
at
all
with
this.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
that
it
was
perfunctory
and
decision
was
based
strictly
on
the
statute.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
this
is
correct.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
yes
sir.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
i
would
like
to
say,
to
use
the
language
neither
is
incompetent
otherwise.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
thank
you.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
i
thought
a
little
more
about
some
questions
from
over
here
during
the
noon
hour
(inaudible)
but
when
we
have
an
automatic
disqualification,
we
have
one
section
15-312
that
of
course
says
that
in
this
case
the
woman
is
equally
entitled,
that
is
what
is
at
issue
here,
but
when
you
have
an
automatic
disqualification
she
is
no
longer
equally
entitled.
now,
the
court
does
have
permission
if
two
people
are
actually
equally
entitled
under
the
idaho
law
to
appoint
one
or
more
--
mr.
allen
r.
derr
otherwise.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
that
15-314
with
this
preference
just
takes
that
right
out
from
under
on
that
one.
also
as
far
as
the
size
of
the
estate
is
concerned,
it
is
not
in
the
record
but
i
think
the
court
should
know
that
cecil
reed
was
appointed
march,
12,
1968
as
the
administrator
pursuant
to
the
probate
court
order
and
a
bond
of
$1,000.00
was
posted
in
the
case.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
no
your
honor.
this
has
been
a
litigation
and
i
might
point
out
that
probate
court
order
which
is
the
subject
of
the
first
appeal
and
this
has
been
through
the
appellate
process
ever
since.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
i
would
think
not,
your
honor
but
in
our
unique
position
we
did
not
feel
we
had
neither
the
--
we
had
neither
the
information
or
the
right
of
going
to
the
probate
court
to
do
that.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
yes
and
there
was
no
--
mr.
allen
r.
derr
no
inventory.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
respondent’s
brief
admits
that
fact.
we
think,
gentleman
that
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
strictly
a
law
with
sex-based
distinctions
which
disregards
individual
abilities
and
capacities
and
is
not
rationally
related
to
the
factor
of
sex,
and
therefore,
we
feel
it
involves
invidious
discrimination
and
is
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
you
are
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
the
right
to
vote
of
course,
they
were
talking
about
the
early
cases.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
i
believe
that
the
circumstances
that
existed
at
that
time
have
long
since
passed.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
that
is
my
understanding
of
it,
your
honor.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
right,
and
i
think
that
was,
if
i
am
not
mistaken
through
of
–
was
that
brad
robert
denied
women
even
right
to
practice
law
before
the
turn
of
the
century.
since
the
turn
of
the
century,
the
cases
that
have
come
before
this
court
have
ended
up
in
decisions
that
i
have
felt
have
been
either
supposedly
beneficial
or
protective
as
far
as
the
women
are
concerned.
obviously
i
can
see
nothing
beneficial
in
the
idaho
law
nor
can
i
see
anything
protective
in
the
idaho
law.
it
is
just
a
law
based
discrimination
against
women
and
once
that
comes
up,
the
door
is
locked
on
the
women.
she
might
as
well
go
home,
if
that
law
is
allowed
to
stand.
now,
idaho
tried
to
justify
this
law
on
two
points,
one;
biological
and
the
other
practical
and
i
do
not
think
either
of
those
points
would
bear
the
strict
scrutiny
and
justify
the
action
that
the
state
has
taken
here.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
that
men
are
generally
better
qualified
than
women
and
that
is
basically
what
the
idaho
supreme
court
said.
going
back
to
the
early
cases,
going
back
to
muller
or
even
goesaert
and
i
think
we
have
cited
a
great
number
of
statistics
to
show
that
women
comprised
40%
of
the
labor
market
now,
roughly
equivalently
educated
in
the
labor
market
and
in
spite
of
all
this
and
because
of
the
sex-based
discriminations
we
say
their
income
is
way
below
the
income
of
a
man.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
it
really
does
not,
this
is
not
an
economic
case
except
this
does,
chief
justice
bring
up
another
point.
the
administrator
does
get
paid
and
very
little
less
than
the
attorney
of
an
estate.
our
briefs
have
extensively
exhausted
the
relationship
between
sex-based
distinctions
and
race-based
distinctions.
and
as
you
know
in
alienage,
in
minority
groups
with
respect
to
indigency
in
some
cases
and
at
least
in
levee
in
respect
to
illegitimacy,
the
strict
test
has
been
applied
and
these
classifications
have
been
held
not
valid
and
with
such
a
large
segment
of
our
population
as
women
are,
i
certainly
do
not
think
it
is
valid
to
them.
in
other
words,
what
i
am
saying
is
i
think
women
are
every
bit
as
entitled
to
protection
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
they
are
persons.
the
action
here
is
state
action
as
aliens,
minority
groups,
indigency,
racial
authorities.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
the
second
justification
is
the
practical
one
in
which
the
court
said
by
doing
this
we
will
avoid
hearings.
again
i
do
not
think
that
is
efficient
to
state
interest
to
even
the
rational
relationship,
let
alone
the
strict
approach
that
would
be
taken
under
a
suspect
classification
and
number
two,
i
do
not
think
it
is
necessarily
true.
for
instance
the
hypothetical,
you
have
two
or
more
men,
you
have
two
or
more
women.
they
all
want
to
administer
the
estate.
the
men
after
a
hearing
cannot
qualify
because
of
these
other
disqualifications,
so
then
the
court
would
have
to
turn
around
and
hold
another
hearing
as
far
as
the
women
contenders
are
concerned.
so
that
--
altogether
i
do
not
think
it
is
number
one,
i
do
not
think
it
is
true,
and
number
two,
i
do
not
think
it
is
sufficient
justification
to
deny
sally
reed
the
equal
protection
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
california
examined
goesaert
very
carefully
not
long
ago
and
in
that
case
they
exhausted
most
of
the
authorities,
it
is
a
very
recent
case,
a
1971
case.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
i
presume
that
is
possible.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
and
that
is
why
it
goes
--
it
probably
is
not
supportive
of
the
respondent's
position
in
this
case.
there
has
been
a
great
deal
of
progress
too
we
might
point
out,
i
am
sure
the
court
is
well
aware
of
the
progress
in
congress
with
the
civil
rights
act,
the
equal
pay
acts
and
some
other
acts
that
have
come
up
and
it
is
a
fang
truth
and
a
lot
of
cases
are
set
forth
in
all
briefs
here
that
lower
courts
are
disregarding
the
so
called
preachings
of
muller,
goesaert
and
hoyt
and
of
course
there
is
a
great
factual
movement
towards
bringing
women
into
our
society
as
a
person.
i
think
the
only
satisfactory
solution
now
is
to
treat
any
classification
of
women
is
suspect
unless
the
classification
involves
physical
characteristics
you
need
to
that
sex.
anything
else
can
get
us
off
into
a
lot
of
other
fields.
i
think
that
could
solve
the
situation,
could
give
guidelines
to
other
--
to
legislatures
or
the
courts
in
order
to
allow
a
woman
to
take
her
full
place
in
our
society,
take
advantage
of
the
opportunities
that
are
available
and
also
take
the
responsibilities
that
always
go
with
opportunity.
and
i
do
not
think
a
suspect
classification
is
a
bad
classification
in
a
sense
and
it
could
be
applied
in
this
case,
i
am
sure,
that
if
the
state
wishes
to
disadvantage
anyone,
should
not
the
state
then
--
should
not
the
burden
be
on
the
oppressor
instead
of
the
oppressed?
is
this
not
a
fundamental
principle
of
fairness?
mr.
allen
r.
derr
i
do
not
see
really
anymore
significant
or
rational
basis
for
that
and
--
mr.
allen
r.
derr
well,
in
the
ways
--
mr.
allen
r.
derr
i
think
the
way
our
state
treats
adopted
children,
the
fourteenth
amendment
would
forbid
it
because
adopted
children
are
given
all
the
rights
and
privileges
of
naturally
born
children.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
to
distinguish,
i
do
not
think
so.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
there
may
be
some
basis
upon
which
a
state
could
sustain
the
half-blood
as
to
the
whole
blood
relationship.
mr.
allen
r.
derr

well,
yes,

mr.

mr.

line
of

we
think
this
is
just
bad
as
--
it
is
a
male
over
female
classification.
i
want
to
summarize
i
think
coming
into
the
eighth
decade
of
the
20th
century
that
we
do
have
to
reexamine
the
situation
as
far
as
sexual
classifications
are
concerned.
we
have
to
discard
those
canards
or
canards,
how
we
pronounce
it,
that
are
not
based
upon
fact.
in
digg,
for
instance
they
were
trying
to
rely
on
--
way
back
in
the
early
1800’s,
the
ideas
that
holmes
set
back
at
ease
and
i
think
what
he
said
is
pretty
interesting.
it
is
revolting
to
have
no
better
reason
for
a
rule
of
law
than
it
was
--
mr.
allen
r.
derr
then
that
--
it
was
laid
down
at
the
time
of
henry
ford,
but
it
is
still
more
revolting
if
the
grounds
upon
which
it
was
laid
down,
a
vanished
long
sense
and
the
rule
simply
persists
from
blind
imitation
of
the
facts.
we
think
if
the
idaho
rule
in
this
case
is
about
to
persist
that
it
will
be
from
blind
imitations
of
past
and
not
based
upon
our
current
understanding
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
the
facts
of
today’s
society.
mr.

based
on
the
--
i
think
it
is,
your
honor

on
those
--
mr.

that
the
laws

both
ways.

country

it

mr.

things

argument.
probate
court
order
that
was
entered
in

and
we
find
the
grounds
recited
in

of

jurisdictional
statement,
recited
only
that
the
statute
violated
15-314
of
the
preference
statute
in
support,
in
over
the
facts
in
support
of
it.
another
thing
that
should
be
pointing
out
to
the
court
that
under
idaho
law
each
of
the
parents
in
this
case,
the
child
died
without
a
will,
are
entitled
to
1/2
of
the
estate.
so
sally

is
interested
here
in
the
protection
of
her
own
property
whatever
that
be
to.
mr.
allen

derr
we
--
my
client

not

any
of
it,
your

i
think
--
that
quietly
argument
of
the
long
acquiescence
was
certainly
put
to
bed
with
brown,
it
is
more
recently
pronounced
in
brown
versus
williams.
i
do
not
think
that
it
has
any
merit.
we
do
not
deny
that
probate
is
a
state
matter
that
when
it
--
when
portions
of
it
or
law
in
connection
therewith
contravenes
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
it
then
becomes
a
substantial
federal
question
that
must
be
resolved.
the
statute
in
this
case
is
simple.
the
actual
wording
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
very
simple,
but
the
case
itself
presents
a
large
and
i
think
significant
problem.
mr.

maintain
one
women’s
school.
mr.

mr.

this

not

that
in
respondent’s
brief
they
raise
the
question,
but
i
take
the
position
that
we
had
a
state
supreme
court
decision
that
we
are
here
on
that
the
law
is
still
in

mr.

we

the
exact
size
of

concede
that
it

be
a
small
estate.
mr.

that
it

of

mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
here
today
to
ask
you
to
do
something
that
this
court
has
never
done
since
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
adopted
in
1868
and
that
is
to
declare
a
state
statute
that
distinguishes
between
--
that
classifies
between
males
and
females
as
unconstitutional.
we
feel
that
the
case
could
have
us
--
at
least
a
significant,
significant
for
women,
somewhat
it
can
to
what
ground
as
board
of
education
had
for
the
butter
--
mr.
allen
r.
derr
if
the
court
please,
that
was
the
goesaert
case
that
you
are
talking
about
sir.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
that
case
was
decided,
your
honor
on
a
premise
that
we
feel
is
no
longer
tenable.
it
allowed
the
wife
or
daughter
of
an
owner
to
tend
bar
that
no
other
women
to
tend
bar.
it
seems
that
it
had
been
felt
by
the
court
that
if
the
wife,
the
wife
or
daughter
would
be
protected
by
the
husband
or
father
and
that
for
other
reason
there
was
a
rational
relationship
to
a
legitimate
state
purpose.
and
as
rational
relationship
test
that
has
followed
through
our
law
had
given
some
indication
that
wherever
there
has
been
a
classification
on
the
basis
of
sex,
anything
goes,
it
is
alright.
and
we
admit
they
are
different,
but
we
do
feel
as
a
result
of
this
rational
relationship
test
is
almost
as
they
enter
it
is
separate
but
equal
test
that

in
holding
that
--
holding
that
women
from
being
considered
person
and
holding
them
back
from
their
entitlement
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution,
the
equal
protection
clause.
now,
a
just
brief
run
down
on
the
facts
of
this
case
which
might
be
helpful
in
our
analyzing
that
--
mr.
allen

derr
there
is
a
serious
question
on
my
mind
because
of
the
mandatory
provisions
and
our
supreme
court
in
the
case
we
are
appealing
from
is
that
that
provision
is
mandatory.
mr.

i
have
known
them
personally

in

this

of
equal
relationship.
i
have
had
a
brother
and
sister

with
each
other.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
any
kind,
a
male
contender
appears
under
the
statute,
the
language
of
the
statute
is
clear.
males

be
preferred

there
is
no
discretion.
mr.

i
would
think
that
the
interpretation

the
interpretation

down
the

other
disqualification

non-residence,

persons

crime

reasons.
none

disqualifications

play.
mr.

opportunity

mr.

mr.

mandatory
preference
was

matter
of
fact
i
do
not
think
there
would
be
a
hearing
at
all
with
this.
mr.
allen

that
it
was
perfunctory
and
decision
was
based
strictly
on
the
statute.
mr.
allen

derr
this
is
correct.
mr.
allen

derr
yes
sir.
mr.

say,
to
use
the
language
neither

incompetent

mr.

r.
derr
thank
you.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
i
thought
a
little
more
about
some
questions
from
over
here
during
the
noon
hour
(inaudible)
but
when
we
have
an
automatic
disqualification,
we
have
one
section
15-312
that
of
course
says
that
in
this
case
the
woman
is
equally
entitled,
that
is
what
is
at
issue
here,
but
when
you
have
an
automatic
disqualification
she
is
no
longer
equally
entitled.
now,
the
court
does
have
permission
if
two
people
are
actually
equally
entitled
under
the
idaho
law
to
appoint
one
or
more
--
mr.
allen

otherwise.
mr.
allen

derr
that
15-314
with
this
preference
just
takes
that
right
out
from
under
on
that
one.
also
as
far
as
the
size
of
the
estate
is
concerned,
it
is
not
in
the
record
but
i
think
the
court
should
know
that
cecil
reed
was
appointed
march,
12,
1968
as
the
administrator
pursuant
to
the
probate
court
order
and
a
bond
of
$1,000.00
was
posted
in
the
case.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
no
your
honor.
this
has
been
a
litigation
and
i
might
point
out
that
probate
court
order
which
is
the
subject
of
the
first
appeal
and
this
has
been
through
the
appellate
process
ever
since.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
i
would
think
not,
your
honor
but
in
our
unique
position
we
did
not
feel
we
had
neither
the
--
we
had
neither
the
information
or
the
right
of
going
to
the
probate
court
to
do
that.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
yes
and
there
was
no
--
mr.
allen
r.
derr
no
inventory.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
respondent’s
brief
admits
that
fact.
we
think,
gentleman
that
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
strictly
a
law
with
sex-based
distinctions
which
disregards
individual
abilities
and
capacities
and
is
not
rationally
related
to
the
factor
of
sex,
and
therefore,
we
feel
it
involves
invidious
discrimination
and
is
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
you
are
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
the
right
to
vote
of
course,
they
were
talking
about
the
early
cases.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
i
believe
that
the
circumstances
that
existed
at
that
time
have
long
since
passed.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
that
is
my
understanding
of
it,
your
honor.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
right,
and
i
think
that
was,
if
i
am
not
mistaken
through
of
–
was
that
brad
robert
denied
women
even
right
to
practice
law
before
the
turn
of
the
century.
since
the
turn
of
the
century,
the
cases
that
have
come
before
this
court
have
ended
up
in
decisions
that
i
have
felt
have
been
either
supposedly
beneficial
or
protective
as
far
as
the
women
are
concerned.
obviously
i
can
see
nothing
beneficial
in
the
idaho
law
nor
can
i
see
anything
protective
in
the
idaho
law.
it
is
just
a
law
based
discrimination
against
women
and
once
that
comes
up,
the
door
is
locked
on
the
women.
she
might
as
well
go
home,
if
that
law
is
allowed
to
stand.
now,
idaho
tried
to
justify
this
law
on
two
points,
one;
biological
and
the
other
practical
and
i
do
not
think
either
of
those
points
would
bear
the
strict
scrutiny
and
justify
the
action
that
the
state
has
taken
here.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
that
men
are
generally
better
qualified
than
women
and
that
is
basically
what
the
idaho
supreme
court
said.
going
back
to
the
early
cases,
going
back
to
muller
or
even
goesaert
and
i
think
we
have
cited
a
great
number
of
statistics
to
show
that
women
comprised
40%
of
the
labor
market
now,
roughly
equivalently
educated
in
the
labor
market
and
in
spite
of
all
this
and
because
of
the
sex-based
discriminations
we
say
their
income
is
way
below
the
income
of
a
man.
mr.
allen

derr
it
really
does
not,
this
is
not
an
economic
case
except
this
does,
chief
justice
bring
up
another
point.
the
administrator
does
get
paid
and
very
little
less
than
the
attorney
of
an
estate.
our
briefs
have
extensively
exhausted
the
relationship
between
sex-based
distinctions
and
race-based
distinctions.
and
as
you
know
in
alienage,
in
minority
groups
with
respect
to
indigency
in
some
cases
and
at
least
in
levee
in
respect
to
illegitimacy,
the
strict
test
has
been
applied
and
these
classifications
have
been
held
not
valid
and
with
such
a
large
segment
of
our
population
as
women
are,
i
certainly
do
not
think
it
is
valid
to
them.
in
other
words,
what
i
am
saying
is
i
think
women
are
every
bit
as
entitled
to
protection
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
they
are
persons.
the
action
here
is
state
action
as
aliens,
minority
groups,
indigency,
racial
authorities.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
the
second
justification
is
the
practical
one
in
which
the
court
said
by
doing
this
we
will
avoid
hearings.
again
i
do
not
think
that
is
efficient
to
state
interest
to
even
the
rational
relationship,
let
alone
the
strict
approach
that
would
be
taken
under
a
suspect
classification
and
number
two,
i
do
not
think
it
is
necessarily
true.
for
instance
the
hypothetical,
you
have
two
or
more
men,
you
have
two
or
more
women.
they
all
want
to
administer
the
estate.
the
men
after
a
hearing
cannot
qualify
because
of
these
other
disqualifications,
so
then
the
court
would
have
to
turn
around
and
hold
another
hearing
as
far
as
the
women
contenders
are
concerned.
so
that
--
altogether
i
do
not
think
it
is
number
one,
i
do
not
think
it
is
true,
and
number
two,
i
do
not
think
it
is
sufficient
justification
to
deny
sally
reed
the
equal
protection
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
california
examined
goesaert
very
carefully
not
long
ago
and
in
that
case
they
exhausted
most
of
the
authorities,
it
is
a
very
recent
case,
a
1971
case.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
i
presume
that
is
possible.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
and
that
is
why
it
goes
--
it
probably
is
not
supportive
of
the
respondent's
position
in
this
case.
there
has
been
a
great
deal
of
progress
too
we
might
point
out,
i
am
sure
the
court
is
well
aware
of
the
progress
in
congress
with
the
civil
rights
act,
the
equal
pay
acts
and
some
other
acts
that
have
come
up
and
it
is
a
fang
truth
and
a
lot
of
cases
are
set
forth
in
all
briefs
here
that
lower
courts
are
disregarding
the
so
called
preachings
of
muller,
goesaert
and
hoyt
and
of
course
there
is
a
great
factual
movement
towards
bringing
women
into
our
society
as
a
person.
i
think
the
only
satisfactory
solution
now
is
to
treat
any
classification
of
women
is
suspect
unless
the
classification
involves
physical
characteristics
you
need
to
that
sex.
anything
else
can
get
us
off
into
a
lot
of
other
fields.
i
think
that
could
solve
the
situation,
could
give
guidelines
to
other
--
to
legislatures
or
the
courts
in
order
to
allow
a
woman
to
take
her
full
place
in
our
society,
take
advantage
of
the
opportunities
that
are
available
and
also
take
the
responsibilities
that
always
go
with
opportunity.
and
i
do
not
think
a
suspect
classification
is
a
bad
classification
in
a
sense
and
it
could
be
applied
in
this
case,
i
am
sure,
that
if
the
state
wishes
to
disadvantage
anyone,
should
not
the
state
then
--
should
not
the
burden
be
on
the
oppressor
instead
of
the
oppressed?
is
this
not
a
fundamental
principle
of
fairness?
mr.
allen
r.
derr
i
do
not
see
really
anymore
significant
or
rational
basis
for
that
and
--
mr.
allen
r.
derr
well,
in
the
ways
--
mr.
allen
r.
derr
i
think
the
way
our
state
treats
adopted
children,
the
fourteenth
amendment
would
forbid
it
because
adopted
children
are
given
all
the
rights
and
privileges
of
naturally
born
children.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
to
distinguish,
i
do
not
think
so.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
there
may
be
some
basis
upon
which
a
state
could
sustain
the
half-blood
as
to
the
whole
blood
relationship.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
yes.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
well,
yes,
adopted
children
are
the
same
as
--
mr.
allen
r.
derr
true.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
our
statute
also
prefers
in
the
line
of
the
fact
to
administer
estates
brothers
or
sisters.
we
think
this
is
just
bad
as
--
it
is
a
male
over
female
classification.
i
want
to
summarize
i
think
coming
into
the
eighth
decade
of
the
20th
century
that
we
do
have
to
reexamine
the
situation
as
far
as
sexual
classifications
are
concerned.
we
have
to
discard
those
canards
or
canards,
how
we
pronounce
it,
that
are
not
based
upon
fact.
in
digg,
for
instance
they
were
trying
to
rely
on
--
way
back
in
the
early
1800’s,
the
ideas
that
holmes
set
back
at
ease
and
i
think
what
he
said
is
pretty
interesting.
it
is
revolting
to
have
no
better
reason
for
a
rule
of
law
than
it
was
--
mr.
allen
r.
derr
then
that
--
it
was
laid
down
at
the
time
of
henry
ford,
but
it
is
still
more
revolting
if
the
grounds
upon
which
it
was
laid
down,
a
vanished
long
sense
and
the
rule
simply
persists
from
blind
imitation
of
the
facts.
we
think
if
the
idaho
rule
in
this
case
is
about
to
persist
that
it
will
be
from
blind
imitations
of
past
and
not
based
upon
our
current
understanding
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
the
facts
of
today’s
society.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
based
on
the
--
i
think
it
is,
your
honor
based
on
those
--
mr.
allen
r.
derr
i
agree
that
the
laws
have
to
be
applied
equally
both
ways.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
yes.
it
might
be
(voice
overlap)
mr.
allen
r.
derr
it
depends
on
how
you
define
rape.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
yes.
we
have
a
law
in
idaho
in
the
mining
country
that
requires
furnish
women
with
chairs,
but
not
men.
i
think
it
is
should
be
both
or
neither.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
i
think
that
women
should
be
in
selected
service.
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
1957
--
mr.
allen
r.
derr
an
equal
protection
claim
because
--
mr.
allen
r.
derr
i
do
not
know
that
he
could
avoid
the
service
himself
on
that
basis,
but
he
might
be
effective
in
getting
it
extended
to
cover
women
as
well
as
--
mr.
allen
r.
derr
sir?
mr.
allen
r.
derr
he
would
not
have
much

mr.
allen
r.
derr
some
other
--
mr.
allen
r.
derr
thank
you,
your
honor.
just
a
few
things
in
response
to
mr.
stout’s
argument.
probate
court
order
that
was
entered
in
here
and
we
find
the
grounds
recited
in
2
(a)
of
the
jurisdictional
statement,
recited
only
that
the
statute
violated
15-314
of
the
preference
statute
in
support,
in
over
the
facts
in
support
of
it.
another
thing
that
should
be
pointing
out
to
the
court
that
under
idaho
law
each
of
the
parents
in
this
case,
the
child
died
without
a
will,
are
entitled
to
1/2
of
the
estate.
so
sally
reed
is
interested
here
in
the
protection
of
her
own
property
whatever
that
be
to.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
we
--
my
client
has
not
seen
any
of
it,
your
honor.
i
think
--
that
quietly
argument
of
the
long
acquiescence
was
certainly
put
to
bed
with
brown,
it
is
more
recently
pronounced
in
brown
versus
williams.
i
do
not
think
that
it
has
any
merit.
we
do
not
deny
that
probate
is
a
state
matter
that
when
it
--
when
portions
of
it
or
law
in
connection
therewith
contravenes
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
it
then
becomes
a
substantial
federal
question
that
must
be
resolved.
the
statute
in
this
case
is
simple.
the
actual
wording
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
very
simple,
but
the
case
itself
presents
a
large
and
i
think
significant
problem.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
case
that
the
women
wanting
to
attend
a
military
school,
but
i
am
familiar
with
the
case,
a
recent
case
that
allowed
a
state
to
maintain
one
women’s
school.
mr.
allen
r.
derr
i
did
not
(inaudible).
thank
you.
