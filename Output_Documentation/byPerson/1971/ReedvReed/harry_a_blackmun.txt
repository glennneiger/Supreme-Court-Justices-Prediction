justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
derr
i
take
it
that
the
new
act
was
not
prompted
by
this
litigation?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
would
you
give
us
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
would
you
give
us
some
enlightenment
as
to
the
significance
of
this
particular
probate?
there
is
an
inference
somewhere
that
it
is
a
less
than
a
thousand
dollars
inside,
is
this
correct?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
that
this
is
essentially
a
test
(inaudible)?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
someone
paid
for
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
are
the
reeds
incidentally
separated
or
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
there
a
mis-connection
could
--
the
idaho
court
have
appointed
mr.
and
mrs.
reed
as
joint
administrators?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
what
is
the
practical
aspect
in
the
day
to
day
routine
of
the
idaho
probate
courts,
do
they
do
this?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
that
at
a
court
in
your
view
then
may
not
appoint
both
even
though
it
is
inclined
to
do
so
and
even
though
both
agree?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
then
you
are
conceding
that
there
is
a
determination
of
comparative
attitude
within
the
scope
of
the
statute.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
are
you
saying
that
a
drunken
husband
has
the
absolute
right
over
a
able
competent
wife.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
does
she
got
the
right
to
do
it?
this
is
what
we
are
asking?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
was
my
question?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
i
wish
to
get
your
position
entirely
clear.
you
are
saying
in
effect
that
i
take
that
a
hearing
is
not
in
order,
that
the
statute
is
mandatory?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
did
you
make
an
attempt
to
claim
on
behalf
of
your
client?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
you
made
no
attempt
to
display
her
qualifications
otherwise?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
did
you
make
an
offer
of
proof?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
we
should
take
this
as
though
the
parties
had
conceded
that
both
parties
are
equally
qualified?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
has
not
an
inventory
been
filed
after
three
years?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
the
fact
an
appeal
is
pending
does
not
prevent
or
stall
it
by
the
fine
of
an
inventory
under
your
practice?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
in
other
words
you
have
not
looked
at
the
file,
probate
file?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
no
inventory?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
or
going
specifically
to
your
statute
in
the
equal
in
–
well,
i
will
read
it,
“of
several
persons
claiming
an
equally
entitled
to
administer,
males
must
be
preferred
to
females
and
relatives
of
the
whole
to
those
of
the
half-blood.”
would
you
make
the
same
argument
on
behalf
of
the
half-bloods
as
against
those
who
are
related
to
the
whole
blood?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
would
that
basis
be?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
derr,
last
term
we
had
a
case
here
involving
a
maine
criminal
statute.
it
described
the
crime
of
escape
and
the
penalties
imposed
were
that
if
it
were
a
woman,
eleven
months,
if
it
were
a
man,
three
years.
do
you
think
this
is
equally
susceptible
to
your
equal
protection
argument?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
in
reverse.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
stout
i
asked
mr.
derr
whether
this
new
statute
was
the
result
of
this
litigation.
he
did
not
know,
do
you
know
whether
it
is?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
whether
this
litigation
had
prompted
the
adoption
of
a
new
code
in
idaho?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
is
a
uniform
code?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
while
i
have
you
interrupted
are
you
counsel
for
mr.
reed
as
administrator?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
have
a
requirement
in
your
present
code
that
an
inventory
be
filed
by
a
certain
date?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
has
it
been
filed?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
that
true
in
your
practice?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
an
appeal
just
dumps
everything?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.

i
