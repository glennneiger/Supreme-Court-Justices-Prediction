mr.
robert
f.
maxwell
yes
sir.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
solely
sears,
roebuck
in
this
matter,
as
an
appellee,
but
i
do
think
i
should
mention
one
or
two
things
where
i
feel
there
has
been
some
misunderstanding.
much
is
made
of
the
washington
case
and
then
impropriety
of
the
repossession
there
that
there
was
no
right
to
immediate
possession
or
title.
there
was
a
hearing
held
in
this
case
by
the
lower
court,
where
mr.
washington
himself
was
summoned
and
so
was
the
plaintiff
mrs.
washington.
mrs.
washington
did
not
appear
nor
did
her
attorneys
and
the
court
after
hearing
testimony
of
mr.
washington,
vacated
the
injunction
that
had
previously
issue
and
the
order
to
return
the
goods,
saying
on
page
29
of
the
record,
“it
now
appears
to
the
court
that
the
representations
upon
which
the
temporary
restraining
order,
september
8
issue
were
incorrect,
both
as
to
allegations
contained
in
the
complaint
and
representations
made
by
counsel.
accordingly,
we
will
both
vacate
the
order
of
september
18.”
thus,
there
is
a
finding
in
the
lower
court
on
the
merits
of
this
controversy
which
has
never
been
controverted.
secondly,
i
would
like
to
call
to
the
court’s
attention
that
while
no
complaint
is
filed
in
pennsylvania
replevin
procedure,
the
bond
itself
signed
by
the
person
making
the
replevin
and
signed
by
a
surety
which
must
be
an
improved
surety
by
the
court
which
is
decided
by
the
judges
themselves,
not
the
prothonotary.
there
must
be
a
corporate
surety
and
twice
the
amount
of
the
goods,
but
this
bond
says
specifically
that
if,
that
the
plaintiff
claims
the
right
to
immediate
possession
of
the
goods
and
that
if
he
does
not
sustain
this
in
an
action,
in
the
action
then
he
is
liable
to
the
defendant,
the
value
of
the
property,
all
legal
costs,
fees
and
damages,
sustained
by
reason
of
the
issuance
of
the
said
writ.
now,
i
would
further
call
to
your
honor’s
attention
that
this
procedure
is
before
that
the
first
instance
before
a
prothonotary
of
the
court
and
his
deputy
clerks
of
the
common
police
court.
the
fact
that
a
complaint
is
not
filed
at
the
beginning
is
taking
care
of
in
my
opinion
by
this
bond
where
the
man
finds
himself
a
replevying
party
and
his
surety
and
says
he
has
a
right
to
immediate
possession.
but
more
than
that,
the
rules
are
replete
as
is
the
original
act
of
1705
in
pennsylvania,
with
immediate
actions
that
the
defendant
can
take
to
turn
away
the
writ,
the
effect
of
the
writ.
true,
he
can
file
a
counter-bond
within
the
72
hours.
if
he
does
so,
then
he
immediately
gets
the
property
back,
but
as
justice
marshall
has
indicated,
this
does
not
result
in
a
back
and
forth
bond.
it
requires
as
the
rule
says
that
all
actions
of
this
nature
shall
follow
the
rules
of
assumption
in
pennsylvania.
there
are
must
be
a
filing
of
the
complaint
immediately
upon
at
this
time
by
the
plaintiff.
there
is
a
right
to
answer
and
then
it
comes
before
the
court
either,
on
a
jury
trial
or
by
mutual
waiver
jury
trial.
now
second,
there
is
also
an
immediate
right
under
the
rules
to
move,
to
adjust
the
bond,
to
cancel
the
bond,
to
take
over
the
prothonotary
to
say
that
they
can
move
the
court
immediately.
they
go
immediately
to
a
judge
to
move
that
the
prothonotary’s
action
in
issuing
this
bond
is
improper
and
to
limit
the
bond,
to
discharge
the
bond,
etcetera.
so
there
is
really
an
actual
--
let
us
see,
this
is
one
of
rules
here
which
are
attached
and
says
specifically
that
the
bond
can
be
adjusted
and
that
there
can
be,
it
can
be
thrown
out
in
fact
by
the
court.
now
--
mr.
robert
f.
maxwell
that
is
right,
yes
sir.
in
other
words
--
mr.
robert
f.
maxwell
then
if
the
bond
were
discharged,
the
goods
would
immediately
revert
to
the
defendant
and
the
court
would
either
enter
a
final
order
at
that
point
or
would
set
it
down
for
a
future
trial.
mr.
robert
f.
maxwell
it
would
be
adjusting
or
they
could
cancel
the
bond.
say
the
bond
has
been
improvidently
issued
the
rule
says.
now,
in
addition
to
this
situation,
a
replevin
action
is
pennsylvania
is
never
dead
until
a
complaint
has
been
filed,
served
upon
the
defendant
and
judgment
entered
either
by
default
after
20
days
or
after
hearing
before
the
court
and
there
are
provisions
in
the
rules
stating
that
the
court
has
the
right
to
give
damages
on
either
side,
substantial
damages,
it
can
hear
the
entire
case
either
before
a
judge
or
before
a
jury.
now,
i
submit
that
under
these
facts,
that
there
has
been
compliance
with
constitutional
rulings
of
this
court
throughout
its
previous
history.
i
think
it
has
been
indicated
in
this
court
that
a
party
first,
taking
advantage
of
a
statute
cannot
be
sought
--
seen
to
come
in
and
to
attack
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
and
this
was
in
the
very
case
of
fay
was
just
mr.
justice
douglas
referred
to
as
an
exception
in
the
sniadach
case
and
the
court
specifically
said
and
i
think
that
opinion
also
was,
i
know
that
was
by
mr.
justice
jackson
said
that
if
you
take
advantage
of
a
statute,
you
cannot
attack
its
constitutionality.
now,
these
people
in
gaining
these
goods,
the
possession
and
title
of
these
goods
depends
on
the
commercial
code
and
the
goods
in
sales
act
to
pennsylvania.
these
forms,
the
way
the
form
reads,
the
amount
or
the
title
of
the
type,
everything
is
provided
by
these
laws.
they
got
possession
of
these
goods
by
means
of
compliance
with
this
act,
but
they
say
that
the
punitive
effect
of
this
act,
the
collecting
of
money
for
it
or
replevying
the
goods,
that
should
be
stricken
down
because
it
is
unconstitutional.
in
this
action,
replevin
is
merely
a
procedural
remedy
to
enforce
the
rights
of
the
creditor
given
by
the
commercial
code,
the
right
to
self-help,
plus
the
right
to
replevy
by
court
action
if
this
is
so
desired
and
this
is
how
the
plaintiff’s
rights
in
this
case
arose
in
this
property
by
this
very
commercial
code
and
certainly,
you
cannot
if
they
just
strike
down
the
replevin
action.
it
would
seem
to
me,
you
would
have
to
strike
down
the
security
provisions
of
the
uniform
commercial
code
which
is
effective
in
49
states.
the
very
language
precisely
here,
saying
that
you
can
proceed
by
self-help
or
in
the
alternative
by
an
action
of
replevin
and
the
action
of
replevin
has
been
proceeded
with
in
this
point,
in
this
case.
now,
i
think
the
only
other
thing
that
this
court
has
said
over
its
past
history,
again
in
certain
exceptions
to
the
sniadach
doctrine
that
is
language
that
was
used
in
the
sniadach
doctrine
as
indicated
that
in
personal
property
if
there
is
sufficient
availability
of
immediate
or
subsequent
remedies
sufficiently
protecting
the
party
against
whom
a
replevin
or
action
has
had,
where
the
property
is
taken
from
him
that
this
satisfies
the
due
process.
now,
in
the
specific
cases
before
speaking
of
the
fourth
amendment,
there
is
certainly
i
can
see
no
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
here
that
was
a
feasible
taking
certainly
in
our
case
and
in
all
other
cases.
and
i
do
not
see
against
--
it
was
by
agreement,
the
right
in
the
property
of
this
plaintiffs
passed
through
them
by
virtue
of
the
uniform
commercial
code,
by
provisions
of
the
uniform
commercial
code
which
is
i
say
is
in
effect
in
49
states
and
then
it
is
said
that
because
it
passed
this
way,
the
other
part
of
the
uniform
commercial
code
which
not
only
gives
rights
to
these
plaintiffs
but
gives
the
facts
that
this
part
of
the
code
should
be
stricken
down
and
i
think
--
mr.
robert
f.
maxwell
pardon?
mr.
robert
f.
maxwell
i
believe
sir,
as
i
understand
it,
that
it
is
louisiana
because
of
the
french
law,
i
believe
that
is
it.
so,
i
think
that
is
really
--
i
adjust
in
this
case,
really
solely
move
for
a
dismissal
on
the
ground
of
this
specific
case.
in
our
specific
case,
we
gave
a
prior
notice,
four
or
five
prior
notices
which
are
part
of
the
record
that
we
were
going
to
repossess,
there
was
default
and
after
that,
we
finally
did
repossess
and
as
i
say,
this
replevin
action
as
any
other
replevin
action
is
still
open.
the
state
courts
are
open
to
these
people.
in
every
one
of
these
cases,
they
could
have
gone
to
the
state
court
and
a
common
police
judge
sitting
in
city
hall
and
(inaudible)
up,
he
would
have
given
immediate
order
if
they
have
rights
on
which
they
can
depend
or
which
they
can,
which
exist.
mr.
robert
f.
maxwell
well
sir
--
mr.
robert
f.
maxwell
your
honor,
you
probably
state
the
law.
in
my
position,
i
have
enough
problems
as
attorney
for
sears,
roebuck
and
general
counsel
for
them
(voice
overlap)
mr.
robert
f.
maxwell
i
do
not
know
sir.
mr.
robert
f.
maxwell
it
did
not
appear
in
the
lower
court,
your
honor.
of
course
there
has
been
a
change.
i
think
this
was
measured
by
mr.
scholl.
it
was
a
change
in
administration
of
the
previous
attorney
general
with
mr.
speaker
and
it
is
now
mr.
shane
creamer.
mr.
robert
f.
maxwell
but
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
right
for
me
to
--
mr.
robert
f.
maxwell
it
has
been
in
effect
since
1705
,your
honor
and
of
course
before
that
i
guess
it
was
common
law,
but
it
was
a
law
of
the
colony
when
the
constitution
was
enacted
in
independence
for
philadelphia.
mr.
robert
f.
maxwell
yes
sir.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
solely
sears,
roebuck
in
this
matter,
as
an
appellee,
but
i
do
think
i
should
mention
one
or
two
things
where
i
feel
there
has
been
some
misunderstanding.
much
is
made
of
the
washington
case
and
then
impropriety
of
the
repossession
there
that
there
was
no
right
to
immediate
possession
or
title.
there
was
a
hearing
held
in
this
case
by
the
lower
court,
where
mr.
washington
himself
was
summoned
and
so
was
the
plaintiff
mrs.
washington.
mrs.
washington
did
not
appear
nor
did
her
attorneys
and
the
court
after
hearing
testimony
of
mr.
washington,
vacated
the
injunction
that
had
previously
issue
and
the
order
to
return
the
goods,
saying
on
page
29
of
the
record,
“it
now
appears
to
the
court
that
the

upon

the
temporary

allegations
contained
in
the
complaint
and
representations
made
by
counsel.
accordingly,
we
will
both
vacate
the
order
of
september
18.”
thus,
there
is
a
finding
in
the
lower
court
on
the
merits
of
this
controversy
which
has
never
been
controverted.
secondly,
i
would
like
to
call
to
the
court’s
attention
that
while
no
complaint
is
filed
in
pennsylvania
replevin
procedure,
the
bond
itself
signed
by
the
person
making
the
replevin
and
signed
by
a
surety
which
must
be
an
improved
surety
by
the
court
which
is
decided
by
the
judges
themselves,
not
the
prothonotary.
there
must
be
a
corporate
surety
and
twice
the
amount
of
the
goods,
but
this
bond
says
specifically
that
if,
that
the
plaintiff
claims
the
right
to
immediate
possession
of
the
goods
and
that
if
he
does
not
sustain
this
in
an
action,
in
the
action
then
he
is
liable
to
the
defendant,
the
value
of
the
property,
all
legal
costs,
fees
and
damages,
sustained
by
reason
of
the
issuance
of
the
said
writ.
now,
i
would
further
call
to
your
honor’s
attention
that
this
procedure
is
before
that
the
first
instance
before
a
prothonotary
of
the
court
and
his
deputy
clerks
of
the
common
police
court.
the
fact
that
a
complaint
is
not
filed
at
the
beginning
is
taking
care
of
in
my
opinion
by
this
bond
where
the
man
finds
himself
a
replevying
party
and
his
surety
and
says
he
has
a
right
to
immediate
possession.
but
more
than
that,
the
rules
are
replete
as
is
the
original
act
of
1705
in
pennsylvania,
with
immediate
actions
that
the
defendant
can
take
to
turn
away
the
writ,
the
effect
of
the
writ.
true,
he
can
file
a
counter-bond
within
the
72
hours.
if
he
does
so,
then
he
immediately
gets
the
property
back,
but
as
justice
marshall
has
indicated,
this
does
not
result
in
a
back
and
forth
bond.
it
requires
as
the
rule
says
that
all

of

of
assumption
in
pennsylvania.
there
are
must
be
a
filing
of
the
complaint
immediately
upon
at
this
time
by
the
plaintiff.
there
is
a
right
to
answer
and
then
it
comes
before
the
court
either,
on
a
jury
trial
or
by
mutual
waiver
jury
trial.
now
second,
there
is
also
an
immediate
right
under
the
rules
to
move,
to
adjust
the
bond,
to
cancel
the
bond,
to
take
over
the
prothonotary
to
say
that
they
can
move
the
court
immediately.
they
go
immediately
to
a
judge
to
move
that
the
prothonotary’s
action
in
issuing
this
bond
is
improper
and
to
limit
the
bond,
to
discharge
the
bond,
etcetera.
so
there
is
really
an
actual
--
let
us
see,
this
is
one
of
rules
here
which
are
attached
and
says
specifically
that
the
bond
can
be
adjusted
and
that
there
can
be,
it
can
be
thrown
out
in
fact
by
the
court.
now
--
mr.
robert
f.
maxwell
that
is
right,
yes
sir.
in
other
words
--
mr.
robert
f.
maxwell
then
if
the
bond
were
discharged,
the
goods
would
immediately
revert
to
the
defendant
and
the
court
would
either
enter
a
final
order
at
that
point
or
would
set
it
down
for
a
future
trial.
mr.
robert
f.
maxwell
it
would
be
adjusting
or
they
could
cancel
the
bond.
say
the
bond
has
been
improvidently
issued
the
rule
says.
now,
in
addition
to
this
situation,
a
replevin
action
is
pennsylvania
is
never
dead
until
a
complaint
has
been
filed,
served
upon
the
defendant
and
judgment
entered
either
by
default
after
20
days
or
after
hearing
before
the
court
and
there
are
provisions
in
the
rules
stating
that
the
court
has
the
right
to
give
damages
on
either
side,
substantial
damages,
it
can
hear
the
entire
case
either
before
a
judge
or
before
a
jury.
now,
i
submit
that
under
these
facts,
that
there
has
been
compliance
with
constitutional
rulings
of
this
court
throughout
its
previous
history.
i
think
it
has
been
indicated
in
this
court
that
a
party
first,
taking
advantage
of
a
statute
cannot
be
sought
--
seen
to
come
in
and
to
attack
the
constitutionality
of
the

and
this
was
in
the
very
case
of
fay
was
just
mr.
justice
douglas
referred
to
as
an
exception
in
the
sniadach
case
and
the
court
specifically
said
and
i
think
that
opinion
also
was,
i
know
that
was
by
mr.
justice
jackson
said
that
if
you
take
advantage
of
a
statute,
you
cannot
attack
its
constitutionality.
now,
these
people
in
gaining
these
goods,
the
possession
and
title
of
these
goods
depends
on
the
commercial
code
and
the
goods
in
sales
act
to
pennsylvania.
these
forms,
the
way
the
form
reads,
the
amount
or
the
title
of
the
type,
everything
is
provided
by
these
laws.
they
got
possession
of
these
goods
by
means
of
compliance
with
this
act,
but
they
say
that
the
punitive
effect
of
this
act,
the
collecting
of
money
for
it
or
replevying
the
goods,
that
should
be
stricken
down
because
it
is
unconstitutional.
in
this
action,
replevin
is
merely
a
procedural
remedy
to
enforce
the
rights
of
the
creditor
given
by
the
commercial
code,
the
right
to
self-help,
plus
the
right
to
replevy
by
court
action
if
this
is
so
desired
and
this
is
how
the
plaintiff’s
rights
in
this
case
arose
in
this
property
by
this
very
commercial
code
and
certainly,
you
cannot
if
they
just
strike
down
the
replevin
action.
it
would
seem
to
me,
you
would
have
to
strike
down
the
security
provisions
of
the
uniform
commercial
code
which
is
effective
in
49
states.
the
very
language
precisely
here,
saying
that
you
can
proceed
by
self-help
or
in
the
alternative
by
an
action
of
replevin
and
the
action
of
replevin
has
been
proceeded
with
in
this
point,
in
this
case.
now,
i
think
the
only
other
thing
that
this
court
has
said
over
its
past
history,
again
in
certain
exceptions
to
the
sniadach
doctrine
that
is
language
that
was
used
in
the
sniadach
doctrine
as
indicated
that
in
personal
property
if
there
is
sufficient
availability
of
immediate
or
subsequent
remedies
sufficiently
protecting
the
party
against
whom
a
replevin
or
action
has
had,
where
the
property
is
taken
from
him
that
this
satisfies
the
due
process.
now,
in
the
specific
cases
before
speaking
of
the
fourth
amendment,
there
is
certainly
i
can
see
no
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
here
that
was
a
feasible
taking
certainly
in
our
case
and
in
all
other
cases.
and
i
do
not
see
against
--
it
was
by
agreement,
the
right
in
the
property
of
this
plaintiffs
passed
through
them
by
virtue
of
the
uniform
commercial
code,
by
provisions
of
the
uniform
commercial
code
which
is
i
say
is
in
effect
in
49
states
and
then
it
is
said
that
because
it
passed
this
way,
the
other
part
of
the
uniform
commercial
code
which
not
only
gives
rights
to
these
plaintiffs
but
gives
the
facts
that
this
part
of
the
code
should
be
stricken
down
and
i
think
--
mr.
robert
f.
maxwell
pardon?
mr.
robert
f.
maxwell
i
believe
sir,
as
i
understand
it,
that
it
is
louisiana
because
of
the
french
law,
i
believe
that
is
it.
so,
i
think
that
is
really
--
i
adjust
in
this
case,
really
solely
move
for
a
dismissal
on
the
ground
of
this
specific
case.
in
our
specific
case,
we
gave
a
prior
notice,
four
or
five
prior
notices
which
are
part
of
the
record
that
we
were
going
to
repossess,
there
was
default
and
after
that,
we
finally
did
repossess
and
as
i
say,
this
replevin
action
as
any
other
replevin
action
is
still
open.
the
state
courts
are
open
to
these
people.
in
every
one
of
these
cases,
they
could
have
gone
to
the
state
court
and
a
common
police
judge
sitting
in
city
hall
and
(inaudible)
up,
he
would
have
given
immediate
order
if
they
have
rights
on
which
they
can
depend
or
which
they
can,
which
exist.
mr.
robert
f.
maxwell
well
sir
--
mr.
robert
f.
maxwell
your
honor,
you
probably
state
the
law.
in
my
position,
i
have
enough
problems
as
attorney
for
sears,
roebuck
and
general
counsel
for
them
(voice
overlap)
mr.
robert
f.
maxwell
i
do
not
know
sir.
mr.
robert
f.
maxwell
it
did
not
appear
in
the
lower
court,
your
honor.
of
course
there
has
been
a
change.
i
think
this
was
measured
by
mr.
scholl.
it
was
a
change
in
administration
of
the
previous
attorney
general
with
mr.
speaker
and
it
is
now
mr.
shane
creamer.
mr.
robert
f.
maxwell
but
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
right
for
me
to
--
mr.
robert
f.
maxwell
it
has
been
in
effect
since
1705
,your
honor
and
of
course
before
that
i
guess
it
was
common
law,
but
it
was
a
law
of
the
colony
when
the
constitution
was
enacted
in
independence
for
philadelphia.
