justice
potter
stewart
he
files
a
bond
in
double
the
amount
of
the
value
of
the
property?
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
is
the
one
who
asserts
the
value
of
the
property?
justice
potter
stewart
i
did
not
--
i
heard
what
you
just
said
now,
that
you
would
examine
well
over
400
cases
and
found
nobody
did
it.
i
did
not
hear
what
you
said
a
little
earlier,
was
there
any
notice
to
the
debtor,
to
the
vendor
that
he
has
this
opportunity
of
filing
a
bond?
justice
potter
stewart
to
mrs.
fuentes?
justice
potter
stewart
what
are
the,
what
were
the
remedies
of
mrs.
fuentes?
one
was
to
file
a
bond
in
the
same
amount
that
had
been
filed
by
firestone?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
what
would
happen?
justice
potter
stewart
until
the
trial
--
so
far
there
is
no
complaint
then
filed?
justice
potter
stewart
so
where
is
the
complaint
(inaudible).
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
so
a
complaint
has
been
filed?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
is
a
complaint,
was
it
a
subsequent,
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
justice
potter
stewart
and,
that
is
the
condition
preceding
to
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
procedure?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then,
there
is
a
copy
of
the
complaint
served
on
mrs.
fuentes?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then,
is
she
filed
a
bond
in
an
amount
equal
to
that
filed
by
firestone
in
this
case,
by
the
plaintiff.
then
the
sheriff
continues
to
hold
the
property,
does
he?
justice
potter
stewart
what
does
the
law
provide?
justice
potter
stewart
file
her
bond
and
then
how
long
does
she
has
to
make
an
answer
to
the
complaint?
justice
potter
stewart
in
order
to
get
the
property
back.
justice
potter
stewart
this
remedy
would
be
available
i
suppose
if
let
us
assume
that
the
personal
property
would
cost
a
thousand
dollars
and
after
$999.00
have
been
paid
and
then
it
was
default
on
the
last
dollar,
the
remedy
would
be
available
to
the
vendor.
justice
potter
stewart
so
you
cannot
say
that
in
every
case
there
is
more
property
right
in
the
plaintiff
than
in
the
defendant?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
there
are
two
reasons
for
that.
one
is
the
fast
appreciation
on
automobile
in
the
first
few
months
in
its
life
and
the
other
is
that
for
the
first
few
months
the
buyer
is
paying
mostly
interest
and
almost
no
principle,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
is
the
question
before
us.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
maxwell,
in
this
case
as
an
earlier
case
today,
we
have
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania,
instead
of
seeking
and
uphold
constitutionality
of
a
legislation
passed
in
his
commonwealth,
respectfully
praying
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
be
reversed
and
that
this
court
entered
a
judgment
deterring
the
pennsylvania
statute
is
unconstitutional
on
their
face.
so
what
is
the
history
of
that?
justice
potter
stewart
we
hear
at
least
i
hear
in
federal
cases
to
the
tradition
that
it
is
the
duty
of
an
attorney
general
of
the
state
to
defend
the
validity
of
his
state
laws?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
can
you
tell
as
what
is
the
--?
justice
potter
stewart
was
state
involved
in
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
law
has
been
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
this
law
has
been
on
the
books,
at
least,
the
core
of
it,
since
what,
1705
(voice
overlap)?
justice
potter
stewart
he
files
a
bond
in
double
the
amount
of
the
value
of
the
property?

potter
stewart
