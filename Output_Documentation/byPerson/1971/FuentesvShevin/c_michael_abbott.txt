mr.
c.
michael
abbott
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
and
may
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
reserve
five
minutes
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
the
nature
of
the
case
before
the
court
now
is
a
challenge
to
the
florida
prejudgment
replevin
statute
on
procedural
due
process
and
fourth
amendments
search
and
seizure
grounds.
the
issues
are
two-fold.
simply
stated,
whether
the
florida
prejudgment
replevin
procedure
in
which
a
writ
is
issued
without
notice
or
prior
hearing
violates
the
procedural
due
process
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
sectioning
whether
the
same
procedure
insofar
that
commands
the
state
officer
to
enter
a
private
ruling
by
force
if
necessary
violates
the
search
and
seizure
provisions
the
fourth
amendment
as
applied
to
the
states
to
the
fourteenth.
the
lower
court
held
with
one
judge
dissenting
that
the
florida
prejudgment
replevin
statutes
were
constitutional.
the
facts
of
the
case
can
be
briefly
stated,
the
appellant
margarita
fuentes
separately
purchased
a
stove
and
a
stereo
from
the
appellee
firestone
tire
and
rubber
company
in
1967
under
retained
title
contracts.
these
contracts
were
then
consolidated
into
one
agreement.
margarita
fuentes
has
complained
to
firestone
on
a
number
of
occasions
about
mechanical
difficulties
with
her
stove.
appellee
firestone
indicates
that
those
difficulties
have
been
repaired.
margarita
fuentes
alleges
that
they
have
not.
for
that
reason
she
began
withholding
payments
on
her
contract
on
april
of
1969.
in
may
of
that
year
firestone
sent
her
telegram
for
repossession.
four-and-a-half
months
later,
on
september
15,
they
filed
an
affidavit
and
a
bond
pursuant
to
the
florida
statute
in
replevin
to
her
property.
the
execution
writ
was
executed
on
the
same
day
on
september
15
by
deputy
sheriff
of
dade
county
over
her
protest
and
a
protest
of
her
relatives.
the
appellant
then
filed
the
instant
action
in
the
court
below
in
november,
1969.
the
dade
county
small
claims
court
on
our
motion
agreed
to
state
that
action
pursuant
to
the
conclusion
of
this
action
and
on
august
24,
a
three-judge
court
below
held
that
neither
of
the
--
that
this
statutory
procedure
did
not
violate
either
the
fourth
or
fourteenth
amendment.
now
with
regards
to
the
issue
of
procedural
due
process,
our
position
can
be
stated
very
simply.
if
you
look
over
the
breadth
of
the
due
process
cases
that
had
come
before
this
court,
conceding
that
it
is
a
flexible
concept,
nevertheless,
one
rule
has
emerged
that
is
that
absent
special
circumstances
involving
a
compelling
governmental
interest,
that
no
one
may
be
deprived
of
a
significant
property
interest
prior
to
having
a
chance
to
contest
the
taking.
that
is
what
this
court
said
in
sniadach
and
reaffirmed
it
in
boddie
versus
connecticut.
mr.
justice
brennan
said
again
in
bell
versus
burson.
now
if
you
look
at
the
florida
procedure,
usually
an
affidavit
is
filed,
although
it
is
not
now
required
in
the
florida
statue
but
was
filed
in
this
case.
it
is
the
usual
procedure
to
file
an
affidavit
in
the
case.
the
claimant
is
lawfully
entitled
to
the
property.
that
is
the
only
allegation
that
you
must
make.
he
files
a
complaint,
a
bond
in
double
the
value
of
the
property
and
the
clerk
issues
the
writ
without
any
judicial
interposition.
simply
a
ministerial
act,
he
issues
the
writ,
while
notes
in
a
hearing,
he
gives
it
to
the
sheriff,
sheriff
takes
it
the
home
and
executes
on
a
property.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
that
is
correct.
and
there
is
no
examination
whether
this
is
true
or
not.
now
we
submit
that
the
florida
procedure
displays
the
same
types
of
constitutional
deficiencies
that
this
court
file
lacking
is
sniadach
versus
family
finance
corporation.
there
is
no
evidence
indicating
the
validity
or
the
probability
of
the
claim
prior
to
the
part
of
the
taking.
the
statute
is
not
nearly
drawn
to
certain
circumstances
that
maybe
have
extreme
interest
to
the
creditor.
there
is
no
need
for
the
credit
to
allege
a
particular
state
interest
that
is
of
concern
to
him,
and
it
is
the
use
of
the
property
here
as
it
was
in
sniadach,
it
is
of
concern.
it
is
use
of
the
property
itself.
there
is
a
property
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
we
are
talking
about.
i
mean
in
fact
the
contract
between
margarita
fuentes
and
firestone
stores
is
simply
this
that
she
said,
i
will
pay
you
more
money
than
the
cash
price
of
these
goods
over
period
of
time,
in
order
that
i
might
have
the
goods
immediately
as
exactly
what
i
am
paying
for,
i
am
paying
for
the
use
of
those
goods.
i
agree
you
to
pay
you
a
finance
charge
so
that
i
may
have
them
now.
and
it
is
the
use
of
the
goods
that
she
is
entitled
to
until
she
defaults.
but
here
under
this
procedure
there
is
no
need
for
firestone
to
prove
that
she
has
in
fact
default
in
this
procedure.
they
come
and
get
it
anytime
they
think
they
want
it
back
for
whatever
reason.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
the
bond
is
under
the
condition
that
firestone
should
be
proven
wrong.
she
can
thereafter
reach
that
bond
and
collect
on
it.
of
course,
the
bond
has
nothing
to
establish
the
validity
of
the
claim.
the
bond
does
nothing
to
mitigate
the
deprivation
between
the
taking
of
the
trial.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
no,
i
do
not
think
so.
i
mean
there
is
no
indication
of
the
claim
itself.
nobody
makes
the
examination
of
whether
there
is
or
there
is
not
a
default.
one
can
argue
that
by
filing
a
bond,
you
cannot
deter
privilege
claims.
that
if
one
has
to
file
bond
you
will
deter
those
people
who
do
not
have
a
proper
claim.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
no,
all
they
have
to
file
is
something
in
the
case
they
are
lawfully
entitled
to,
not
to
the
extent
one
brief
that
as
anything
default.
i
suppose
yes,
but
there
is
no
examination.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
if
firestone
then
does
not
prove
at
the
this
comes
to
trial
that
they
are
lawfully
entitled
to
it,
mrs.
fuentes
raised
defenses
that
show
that
firestone
is
not,
then
if
she
can
show
damages
she
can
reach
the
bond.
but
in
the
first
instance
they
have
to
show
nothing,
all
they
have
to
do
is
file
an
affidavit
that
is
all
pre
written
and
said,
i
am
lawfully
entitled
to
property.
it
seems
to
me
that
what
we
have
to
focus
on
this
case
are
what
are
the
state
interests
here
that
are
compelling
that
require
firestone
to
need
this
kind
of
summary
procedure.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
if
they
could
show
that,
then
i
think
that
might
be
significant
your
honor.
in
fact,
it
is
interesting
to
note
here,
that
in
april
when
she
withheld
her
first
payment
they
sent
her
a
notice.
in
may
they
sent
a
telegram
saying,
we
are
going
to
repossess
within
24
hours
if
you
do
not
start
paying.
then
they
waited
for
four-and-a-half
months
before
they
actually
issued
the
writ.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
no,
the
only
point
i
am
trying
to
make
is
that
if
they
are
actually
interested
in
getting
the
property
because
of
the
deteriorating
value,
why
then
did
they
wait
this
length
of
time
before
going
after
it.
i
think
what
they
really
want
is
they
want
the
money.
by
taking
the
property
first,
they
gained
an
additional
bit
of
leverage
over
that
period
of
time
to
try
to
coerce
her
to
pay
whether
she
may
have
all
defenses
or
not,
i
think
that
is
the
point
to
be
made.
it
seems
to
me
though
that
if
one
looks
at
the
interest
that
the
appellees
before,
it
is
compelling
this
procedure,
there
is
simply
no
indication
that
it
is
necessary
for
them
to
do
this.
the
state
of
florida
says
that
it
is
the
protection
of
property
of
florida
citizens
that
is
of
compelling
interest
here.
but
of
course
our
position
would
be
there
emphasizing
the
rights
of
one
class
such
as
creditors
over
another
class
such
as
debtors.
they
also
say,
well,
it
is
the
economic
life
of
the
community
that
is
at
stake
here.
as
a
matter
of
fact
though
there
is
no
evidence
at
all
indicating
that
there
is
any
relationship
between
attachment
type
remedies
and
the
availability
of
credit.
the
california
supreme
court
was
recently
faced
with
the
same
issue
just
last
month
in
randone
versus
appellate
department.
they
reject
and
they
said,
there
is
no
evidence
here
that
there
is
any
relationship
between
attachment
of
property
like
this
and
the
availability
of
credit.
and
further,
we
note
that
there
are
some
prevalent
studies
that
indicate
that
there
is
no
relationship
between
these
two
factors.
so,
if
in
fact
firestone
is
restricted,
what
is
going
to
happen?
well,
the
only
evidence
before
this
court
indicating
that
there
is
going
to
be
any
damage
to
firestone
at
all,
it
is
an
affidavit
by
firestoneâ€™s
own
national
manager
of
retail
credit
in
akron,
ohio.
the
lower
court
re-indicated
the
counter
affidavit
by
professor
william
f.
willauer
(ph)
of
the
national
consumer
law
center
in
boston.
we
did
not
even
submit
that
to
the
record
on
this
court
because
we
do
not
feel
that
either
of
these
affidavits
gives
the
court
the
kind
of
hard
data
on
which
you
could
comfortably
rely
and
say
yes,
in
fact,
there
is
gong
to
be
an
economic
depravation
to
elect
the
community
here.
but
let
us
go
one
step
further.
let
us
assume
that
replevin
is
essential
to
consumer
credit.
it
seems
to
me
that
one
can
make
the
argument
that
to
the
extent
that
you
give
debtors
or
creditors
relatively
inexpensive
and
expeditious
remedies
such
as
we
have
here,
to
that
extent,
they
just
encourage
them
to
over
extend.
i
mean
maybe
they
are
giving
credit
to
people
that
should
not
have
credit.
now
is
that
in
the
interest
of
the
citizens
of
florida?
i
do
not
think
so.
our
research
shows
that
one
out
of
five
people
simply
default
on
this
thing.
they
just
never
show
up
once
their
property
is
taken,
they
think
it
is
gone.
i
think
that
is
significant
one
of
the
every
five
people.
i
suspect
that
is
low
over
the
national
average,
i
suspect
it
is
much
higher,
and
then
if
you
look
that
studies
of
dr.
castlewich
(ph)
who
has
mentioned
this
morning
(inaudible)
find
you
will
that
nationally
that
the
default
rate
is
much
higher
but
in
florida
every
one
out
of
five.
so
i
do
not
think
they
can
show
that
even
if
assume
that
they
are
going
to
be
hurt,
i
do
not
think
they
can
show
that
consumer
credit
itself
is
related
to
public
interest.
the
amici
in
this
case
say
that,
in
addition
to
this,
there
is
a
public
interest
in
the
conservation
of
state
resources.
well
that
may
be
true.
they
are
assuming
that
a
pre-hearing
procedure
is
going
to
take
more
resources
than
there
is
now.
there
is
going
to
be
a
trial
in
this
case,
there
is
supposed
to
be
a
trial.
so,
simply
by
having
the
hearing
first
that
is
not
necessary
indicate
that
you
are
going
to
have
to
spend
more
state
money.
think
only
in
those
few
cases
where
you
have
a
really
compelling
interest,
where
you
can
show
for
example
that
the
debtors
about
to
take
the
property
of
the
jurisdiction
or
he
is
going
probably
convey
that
third
person
or
that
is
rapidly
deteriorating
the
value.
those
are
types
of
cases
where
you
might
want
to
have
some
kind
of
summary
procedure.
but
even
then,
you
can
still
do
it
on
probability,
you
do
not
just
have
give
it
to
him
and
say
we
believe
you,
you
can
say,
what
is
the
evidence
that
you
have
the
right
to
this
property?
what
is
the
compelling
situation
that
you
need
it
now?
then
okay,
we
will
let
you
take
it.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
i
suspect
it
probably
is
your
honor,
although
that
relates
somewhat
to
the
consuming
of
property
under
lien
statute
of
order,
which
has
firestone
has
pointed
out
in
the
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
of
that
state
is
no
longer
valid
aside
from
that
particular
statute,
i
am
not
just
sure
if
there
are
other
statutes
indicating
it
is
a
misdemeanor
to
move
the
property,
i
just
do
not
know.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
it
seems
to
me
it
might.
it
seems
to
me
it
might
if
you
could
show
that
in
fact
you
had
that
fear.
then
in
fact
they
thought
margarita
fuentes
was
one
want
to
move
the
property.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
but,
if
you
have
evidence
to
show
that
there
was
some
reason
to
make
that
evidence
that
you
know
on
the
broad
basis
i
think,
you
know,
there
will
be
a
point
there.
the
whole
point
that
we
make
that
there
is
no
evidence
indicating
that
a
large
number
of
that
is
expect,
what
firestone
says,
in
their
own
brief
at
page
18,
they
say,
in
the
vast
majority
of
these
cases,
and
that
is
their
language
not
mine,
in
the
vast
majority
of
this
case
statute
that
is
voluntarily
relinquished
the
property,
give
it
up
freely.
they
also
point
out
that
default
rate
in
all
consumer
installment
contract
of
this
kind
is
1.76%.
way
below
the
types
of
defaults
that
the
consumers
are
having,
when
they
just
do
not
show
up.
i
mean,
we
are
talking
about
a
very
narrow
portion
of
the
total
consumer
contract.
and
there
is
no
evident
even
indicating
that
small
portion.
there
is
going
to
be
a
large
number
if
we
are
going
abscond
at
the
property.
in
fact,
if
they
are
the
ones
to
abscond,
it
seems
to
me
he
has
a
lot
of
opportunity
to
do
so
prior
to
the
time
of
the
hearing.
i
mean,
firestone
just
like
any
other
creditor
begins
to
go
to
this
debt
collection
process
once
they
think
there
is
a
default.
you
know,
they
sent
margarita
fuentes
a
letter,
they
sent
her
a
telegram
and
she
really
wants
to
get
rid
of
the
property
it
seems
to
me
she
is
going
to
do
it
then
and
she
knows
eventually,
that
they
may
come
and
get
it,
it
seems
to
me.
but,
if
she
had
the
default
she
still
simply
not,
if
she
thinks
she
has
not
defaulted,
she
is
simply
not
going
to
give
it
up.
i
mean,
if
it
is
her
property,
why
should
she?
but,
there
is
no
evidence
over
the
broad
basis
to
indicate
that
the
firestone
needs
this
kind
of
protection
that
they
can
not
just
provide
it,
and
they
have
not
provided
it.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
i
would
not
your
honor
because
i
think
what
would
happen
is
that
it
would
quickly
become
a
rubber
stamp
procedure.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
only
in
narrow
circumstances
where
they
can
tell
proper
with
the
compelling
reason.
but
these
are
sometimes
very
complex
issues.
if
you
take
a
look
at
the
brief
of
national
consumer
law
center,
one
of
the
things
that
is
interesting
in
this
case
that
it
is
here
that
the
security
interest
that
firestone
had
in
the
stove
had
expired
at
the
time
they
got
it.
that
is
to
say
that
in
any
rational
allocation
of
payments
between
the
stereo
and
the
stove,
mrs.
fuentes
had
paid
off
that
stove
when
they
came
and
took
it.
and,
that
is
not,
not
a
type
of
defense
that
the
judge
looking
at
the
contract,
see.
she
has
got
to
have
a
chance
to
commend
and
say
you
know,
i
paid
for
that
stove
already,
firestone
has
breached
their
warranty
of
repair.
a
judge
just
by
himself
not
makes
that
kind
of
determination.
finally
it
seems
to
me,
i
would
like
to
look
briefly
at
the
fourth
amendment
issue.
under
the
florida
procedure,
the
writ
commanded
the
officer,
state
officer,
the
deputy
sheriff
in
our
case,
to
enter
by
force
if
necessary
and
to
make
a
reasonable
exploration
of
the
dwelling
in
order
to
find
the
property.
the
problem
we
have
with
that
is
again,
what
is
the
compelling
state
interest
that
firestone
has
in
allowing
the
deputy
sheriff
not
only
to
enter
but
to
enter
by
force
if
necessary.
now,
if
you
look
at
the
balancing
test
which
this
court
has
done
in
the
past,
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
weigh
the
interest
of
firestone
against
the
invasion
which
that
entails,
and
if
we
agree
with
mr.
justice
white
said
in
camara
that
you
are
going
to
have
as
much
of
a
disturbance
in
a
civil
seizure
as
you
are
in
criminal
procedure.
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
to
allege
a
very
substantial
state
interest
before
you
can
go
in
to
that
home.
again,
the
statute
is
not
nearly
drawn,
there
is
no
advance
notice
that
they
are
coming
here,
i
think
it
appears
in
with
wyman
versus
james,
resistance
with
misdemeanor
compares
to
mr.
wyman
where
if
the
welfare
is
different,
wanted
to
refuse
she
could.
there
is
no
way
to
refuse
here;
the
sheriff
is
going
to
go
in
whether
you
refuse
or
not.
if
you
look
at
the
back
of
this
case
margarita
fuentes
did
everything,
one
could
expect
of
a
private
citizen
to
do.
short
of
actually
physically
obstructing
the
sheriff,
she
told
him,
she
stopped
him
at
the
door,
she
called
her
son-in-law,
the
son
of
son-in-law
who
speaks
english
which
she
does
not,
explained
to
the
sheriff
that
he
could
not
take
the
property.
the
sheriff
comes
back
and
says
i
have
got
to
take
your
property
that
it
is
my
obligation;
only
at
that
point
did
she
let
him
enter
the
house.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
i
do
not
think
so
your
honor,
unless
there
was
some
evidence
to
indicate
that
she
was
attempting
to
conceal
it.
if
firestone
indicates
we
do
not
know
where
it
is,
we
cannot
find
and
she
refuses
to
indicate
that
she
still
has
it
in
order
to
make
her
feel
secure
and
then
they
may
have
an
interest.
but
the
court
is
not
this
case.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
simply
the
fact
it
is
in
the
home.
but
to
the
extent
that
the
property
is
located
in
a
public
dwelling
where
they
may
have
a
chance
to
enter
anyway,
it
seems
to
me
that
one
can
make
a
less
concurring
claim.
of
course,
that
is
not
the
statute
and
the
statute
does
not
cover
special
situations
like
that.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
it
seems
to
me
under
the
due
process
cases
of
this
court,
it
is
established.
switching
back
the
procedures
of
due
process
issue
for
example,
if
you
look
at
the
cases
that
were
cited,
sniadach,
all
of
those
cases
dealt
with
the
compelling
state
interest,
you
know,
fahey
versus
mallonee.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
it
seems
to
me
it
comes
within
the
general
principle,
yes.
it
seems
to
me
as
far
as
they
have
to
show
some
reason
why
they
need
this
procedure.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
i
suspect
they
will
not
your
honor.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
the
statute
does
have
a
counterbond
your
honor.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
yes,
it
does.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
think,
one
of
the
things
that
is
also
interesting.
if
you
look
at
the
record
here
it
appears
that
in
fact
what
the
sheriff
was
supposed
to
do
was
he
was
supposed
to
take
this
property
in
hold
for
three
days
and
give
mrs.
fuentes
a
chance
to
post
a
counterbond.
but
in
the
first
place
there
is
no
notice
to
her
that
she
has
that
opportunity.
i
mean,
only
if
she
has
a
lawyer
who
can
tell
her
within
72
hours
that
exist
would
she
ever
be
likely
to
do
it.
we
examined
442
cases
in
fact
in
county
small
claims
court
and
we
found
that
nobody
ever
in
that
entire
year
ever
posted
a
counterbond.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
to
the
debtor?
there
is
no
--
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
no,
there
is
no
notice
to
mrs.
fuentes
that
she
has
the
opportunity.
well,
one
of
the
other
interesting
things
is
even
though
the
sheriff
is
supposed
to
hold
her
property
for
three
days,
it
appears
from
the
record
below
that
actually
the
property
went
directly
to
firestone.
i
mean,
firestone
accompanied
the
sheriff
in
their
truck;
firestone
took
the
property
not
the
sheriff.
they
took
it
immediately,
but,
in
way
three
days
--
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
if
she
had
filed
the
bond
and
if
the
sheriff
was
still
holding
the
property
then
she
has
the
chance
to
get
it
back
until
the
trial.
of
course,
one
of
the
other
things
we
found
is
that
--
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
yes,
there
is
a
complaint
in
the
florida
procedure.
there
is
none
in
the
pennsylvania.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
there
is
a
complaint
in
under
the
florida
procedure,
they
do
file
a
complaint.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
they
do
not
in
pennsylvania.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
that
is
correct.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
that
is
right,
that
is
right.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
it
is;
it
is.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
the
affidavit
that
they
are
entitled
to
it
or
not,
and
nobody
ever
looks
to
see
what
the
complaint
says.
but
they
do
have
to
file
one.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
it
is
at
the
time
the
property
is
taken.
there
is
no
previous
notice.
the
same
time,
the
sheriff
takes
the
property,
he
says
here
is
the
affidavit,
and
here
is
the
complaint.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
well,
he
is
supposed
to.
i
do
not
think
he
did
in
this
case.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
he
is
supposed
to
hold
the
property
for
three
days,
give
her
the
chance
to
file
her
bond.
but,
what
we
have
found
is
that
--
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
then
she
has
the
normal
time
to
make
an
answer.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
assuming
that
sheriff
has
that
is
correct.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
she
gets
the
property
back
totally
--
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
no,
no,
no.
i
am
sorry
your
honor.
the
sheriff
is
supposed
to
hold
it
for
three
days
before
he
gets
it
to
firestone.
now,
if
she
does
not
file
a
bond
he
then
gives
it
to
firestone.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
if
she
does
file
a
bond
he
then
gets
it
back
to
margarita
fuentes.
of
course
our
research
shows
that
nobody
ever
have
filed
a
bond.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
that
is
right,
that
there
is
a
provision
there.
it
is
also
interesting
to
know
i
think
though
that
in
order
to
file
this
type
of
a
bond,
you
got
to
put
forward
the
full
amount,
full
cash
value
of
the
property.
and
firestone
can
file
their
bond
for
about
1%
of
the
total
of
their
charges,
say
$200.00
here.
mrs.
fuentes,
on
the
forth
coming
bond
is
going
to
have
to
file
the
full
cash
value,
$200.00
plus
a
premium.
if
mrs.
fuentes
were
a
plaintiff,
they
would
make
no
distinction,
she
could
then
file
1%
bond,
it
is
not
a
question
of
we
know,
we
think
firestone
is
more
reputable
than
mrs.
fuentes.
it
is
just
simply
a
question
of
are
you
a
plaintiff
or
are
you
a
defendant,
if
you
are
a
defendant,
you
file
a
full
bond,
if
you
are
a
plaintiff,
the
bonding
companies
are
willing
to,
let
us
say,
file
1%.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
she
is
your
honor,
she
is.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
that
is
correct.
of
course
in
the
meantime
she
is
about
--
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
if
she
can
show
damages,
she
then
gets
damages.
i
think
it
would
be
very
difficult
--
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
that
is
right.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
that
is
right.
but
assume
for
example,
it
is
not
this
case,
but
assume
she
is
about
out
of
stove
that
she
was
using
for
six
weeks
prior
to
trial,
how
do
you
show
those
types
of
damages?
the
types
of
damages
one
is
liable
to
be,
one
is
liable
to
suffer
are
not
the
type
that
you
can
show
in
terms
of
money
and
that
is
our
point,
it
is
the
taking
of
the
property
that
is
a
deprivation
of
itself,
it
is
the
significant
interest.
now,
we
are
talking
about
property
worth
about
$600.00.
she
has
got
the
right
to
hold
on
that,
now
they
show
she
defaults
that
is
the
contract.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
she
must
file
it
in
three
days.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
prior
to
trial.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
the
florida
law
is
a
little
bit
uncertain.
we
believe
she
can.
there
are
cases
which
indicate
that
she
cannot.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
that
is
right.
that
is
our
position,
yes.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
no.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
i
think
it
is
unlike
the
pennsylvania
procedure
where
there
is
no
requirement
that
you
file
a
complaint
at
all.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
well,
they
did
not
i
suppose
that
if
they
did
not
show
for
the
hearing,
it
would
just
be
just
be
a
moot,
but
ordinarily,
yes.
i
mean,
in
the
normal
course
of
events
one
would
normally
conclude
a
complaint.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
yes,
if
there
is
an
answer
filed
then
you
are
going
to
have
your
trial.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
on
the
part
of
the
debtor,
correct.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
no,
she
is
not
informed.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct
your
honor.
i
briefly
just
like
to
run
over
what
the
lower
court
held.
i
mean,
one
of
the
things
they
said
is
it
seems
to
them
that
firestone,
that
mrs.
fuentes
may
have
wage
her
rights.
it
is
a
little
unclear
from
the
opinion
but
it
appears
that
they
are
saying
that
since
the
contract
reads
that
in
the
event
of
default
of
any
payments,
since
mrs.
fuentes
has
admitted
that
she
withheld
payments,
therefore,
that
gives
firestone
the
right
to
the
property.
i
think
that
is
an
incorrect
assertion
of
florida
law.
our
whole
position
during
the
whole
litigation
has
been
that
â€˜defaultâ€™
is
a
technical
word.
default
indicates
breach
of
legal
obligation.
now,
if
firestone
has
breached
the
warranty
as
she
says
they
have,
under
the
uniform
commercial
code
in
florida,
she
has
a
right
to
suspend
her
payments;
that
is
her
right.
therefore,
she
has
a
right
to
suspend
payments,
she
cannot
be
in
default.
if
the
contracts
said,
in
the
event
of
an
omission
of
payment,
firestone
is
entitled
to
repossession.
then
they
would
have
a
stronger
case,
but
it
did
not
say
that,
it
says
in
the
event
of
default
in
payment,
there
can
be
no
default
unless
one
proves
that
there
is
a
technical
default
and
that
has
not
been
proved
here.
likewise,
the
court
below
said
that
we
are
here
dealing
with
a
peaceable
entry
into
her
home.
it
seems
to
me
that
with
due
difference
to
the
lower
court
that
is
misleading,
i
think
the
question
has
to
be
asked,
are
we
dealing
with
an
entry
that
is
coerced?
and
did
mrs.
fuentes
say,
sheriff
come
on
in
and
take
my
property,
it
is
alright,
or
did
she
stop
them
at
the
door
and
say
you
cannot
have
it.
what
happened
--
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
i
think
there
was
no
prior
consent
in
the
taking?
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
the
contract
says,
in
the
event
of
default
of
any
payment
or
payments
--
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
that
is
correct.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
not
unless
they
can
show
some
compelling
reason
that
they
need
to
break
the
sanctity
of
the
home.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
i
think
maybe
she
could,
i
do
not
think
she
did
--
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
in
the
event
of
default
--
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
of
course
there
had
been
no
default
in
our
opinion.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
no,
assuming
that
there
--
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
now
assuming
there
had
been
a
default,
it
still
seems
to
me
that
that
she
ought
to
have
a
chance
to
comply
first.
i
mean,
they
give
her
no
notice
they
are
coming.
if
they
--
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
no,
i
do
not
believe
it
is.
it
seems
to
me
there
has
got
to
be
--
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
she
has
got
to
have
a
knowing
waiver.
it
seems
to
me
it
is
their
burden
to
show
that
she
has
knowingly
waived
it.
i
think
she
could
knowingly
but
perhaps
under
proper
circumstances.
i
do
not
think
that
the
contract
here
indicates
that
she
did
or
even
has
the
kind
of
language
indicating
that
we
have
the
right
to
enter
your
home.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
if
the
written
waiver
indicated
what
firestone
contends
it
indicates?
i
do
not
think
it
does;
i
do
not
think
if
you
read
the
contract
you
glean
from
it
an
indication
or
an
inference
that
firestone
has
a
right
to
enter
their
home.
that
is
not
in
there.
if
it
were
then
it
is
to
be
a
more
difficult
case.
i
would
like
to
reserve
more
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
briefly
with
regard
to
the
facts
the
only
point
i
want
to
make
is
that
to
the
extent
that
the
appellee
firestone
continues
to
say
that
the
sheriff
was
invited
in
to
the
home
i
think
it
is
essentially
misleading.
i
would
also
like
to
note
one
error
--
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
no,
it
is
not
stipulated
your
honor.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
what
happened
is
that
mrs.
fuentes
allowed
the
sheriff
to
enter
after
he
had
made
clear
his
position
that
he
has
the
obligation
to
execute
the
writ.
she
did
not
say
you
come
on
in
to
my
home
to
say
that
he
was
actually
invited.
i
think
what
happened
was
he,
mrs.
fuentes
acquiesced.
in
fact
mr.
leon
(ph)
acquiesced
in
speaking
for
mrs.
fuentes
who
does
not
speak
english.
but
one
thing
i
did
want
to
note
is
that
both
the
lower
court
in
our
own
brief
made
an
error
in
indicating
that
mrs.
delgado
called
the
son-in-law
to
come
to
the
house
because
firestone
continues
to
contend
that
mrs.
fuentes
herself
made
no
protest.
i
think
that
is
not
true
but
in
fact
--
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
i
do
not
think
they
do.
the
firestone
contends
that
mrs.
fuentes
did
not
make
any
objection.
the
only
point
i
want
to
make
is
that
the
record
on
page

would
show
that
actually
mrs.
fuentes
who
called
mr.
leon
and
not
her
daughter-in-law
and
the
lower
court
in
their
own
brief
including
lower
court
were
in
error
on
that
point.
the
only
point
i
want
to
emphasize
is
to
say
as
mr.
wright
does
that
they
have
more
property
right
than
mrs.
fuentes
has
or
she
gets
more
property
right.
the
firestone
has
i
think
missed
the
point.
my
whole
point
has
been
that
what
mrs.
fuentes
was
paying
for
is
the
use
of
these
goods
and
that
is
why
she
pays
a
higher
price
in
the
cash
sale
price.
in
fact,
we
can
show
in
this
case
i
think,
that
they
did
not
have
any
security
interest
in
the
stove
at
all
when
they
took,
i
do
not
think
that
is
particularly
important
i
think
the
situation
would
be
exactly
the
same
if
she
had
made
only
one
payment
at
the
time
they
came
to
take
it.
that
they
have
security
interest
in
both
items.
the
point
to
be
made
is
that
she
is
paying
more
for
this
so
that
she
can
have
their
use
immediately.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
that
is
right.
but
of
course
uniform
commercial
code
and
florida
says
that
our
situation
in
which
she
has
a
right
to
suspend
payment.
that
is
crux
of
our
thrust,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
firestone
ought
to
establish
that
she
has
violated
or
is
someone
in
default.
i
mean,
if
the
florida
gives
her
a
right
to
suspend
payments,
is
it
then
fair
to
give
firestone
a
right
to
take
their
property
before
they
prove
they
are
entitled
to
it,
and
that
is
our
thrust.
it
seems
to
me
to
the
extent
that
the
appelleeâ€™s
rest
on
the
specialized
property
that
they
are
ignoring
the
vast
history
that
the
due
process
cases
in
this
court.
this
court
has
always
looked
first
to
the
state
interest
involved
and
then
if
there
is
a
compelling
state
interest
they
look
to
see
whether
the
property
is
significant.
here,
the
very
little
talk
coming
from
the
appellees
on
the
significance
of
the
interest
on
why
they
need
this
procedure,
why
is
it
compelling
that
they
have,
what
interest
did
they
show
that
they
needed
or
as
required
that
they
are
going
to
settle
without
it.
they
just
have
not
shown
that
and
that
is
the
thrust
of
the
past
case
in
this
court,
you
look
first
to
the
state
interest.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
it
seems
to
me
if
they
are
violating
the
fundamental
rule
--
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
that
is
right,
if
you
look
to
the
cases
--
mr.
justice
stewart,
if
you
look
at
the
case
that
have
decided
is
sniadach,
all
of
those
cases
have
a
compelling
state
interest
except
for
two,
ownbey
versus
morgan
and
mcinnes
versus
mckay
about
which
mr.
wright
speaks.
now
those
two
cases
at
least
ownbey
is
clear
involve
a
non-resident
defendant.
so,
they
needed
that
kind
of
prejudgment
attachment
in
order
to
bring
them
into
court.
mcinnes
versus
mckay
which
is
the
per
curiam
decision
appears
to
indicate
that
also
there
was
non-resident
defendant
there
too
to
extent
the
court
speaks
of
the
defendant
of
making
a
special
appearance.
those
are
the
only
two
cases
cited
by
the
court
in
sniadach
in
which
there
is
not
a
compelling
state
interest
in
terms
of
the
statute
at
hand
in
which
a
private
creditor
initiated
procedure
to
only
two
cases,
and
both
of
those
cases
are
distinguishable
and
that
you
needed
the
statute
in
order
to
bring
that
defense
in
court.
all
the
rest
of
those
cases
involve
compelling
state
interest.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
i
thank
you.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
and
may
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
reserve
five
minutes
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
the
nature
of
the
case
before
the
court
now
is
a
challenge
to
the
florida
prejudgment
replevin
statute
on
procedural
due
process
and
fourth
amendments
search
and
seizure
grounds.
the
issues
are
two-fold.
simply
stated,
whether
the
florida
prejudgment
replevin
procedure
in
which
a
writ
is
issued
without
notice
or
prior
hearing
violates
the
procedural
due
process
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
sectioning
whether
the
same
procedure
insofar
that
commands
the
state
officer
to
enter
a
private
ruling
by
force
if
necessary
violates
the
search
and
seizure
provisions
the
fourth
amendment
as
applied
to
the
states
to
the
fourteenth.
the
lower
court
held
with
one
judge
dissenting
that
the
florida
prejudgment
replevin
statutes
were
constitutional.
the
facts
of
the
case
can
be
briefly
stated,
the
appellant
margarita
fuentes
separately
purchased
a
stove
and
a
stereo
from
the
appellee
firestone
tire
and
rubber
company
in
1967
under
retained
title
contracts.
these
contracts
were
then
consolidated
into
one
agreement.
margarita
fuentes
has
complained
to
firestone
on
a
number
of
occasions
about
mechanical
difficulties
with
her
stove.
appellee
firestone
indicates
that
those
difficulties
have
been
repaired.
margarita
fuentes
alleges
that
they
have
not.
for
that
reason
she
began
withholding
payments
on
her
contract
on
april
of
1969.
in
may
of
that
year
firestone
sent
her
telegram
for
repossession.
four-and-a-half
months
later,
on
september
15,
they
filed
an
affidavit
and
a
bond
pursuant
to
the
florida
statute
in
replevin
to
her
property.
the
execution
writ
was
executed
on
the
same
day
on
september
15
by
deputy
sheriff
of
dade
county
over
her
protest
and
a
protest
of
her
relatives.
the
appellant
then
filed
the
instant
action
in
the
court
below
in
november,
1969.
the
dade
county
small
claims
court
on
our
motion
agreed
to
state
that
action
pursuant
to
the
conclusion
of
this
action
and
on
august
24,
a
three-judge
court
below
held
that
neither
of
the
--
that
this
statutory
procedure
did
not
violate
either
the
fourth
or
fourteenth
amendment.
now
with
regards
to
the
issue
of
procedural
due
process,
our
position
can
be
stated
very
simply.
if
you
look
over
the
breadth
of
the
due
process
cases
that
had
come
before
this
court,
conceding
that
it
is
a
flexible
concept,
nevertheless,
one
rule
has
emerged
that
is
that
absent
special
circumstances
involving
a
compelling
governmental
interest,
that
no
one
may
be
deprived
of
a
significant
property
interest
prior
to
having
a
chance
to
contest
the
taking.
that
is
what
this
court
said
in
sniadach
and
reaffirmed
it
in
boddie
versus
connecticut.
mr.
justice
brennan
said
again
in
bell
versus
burson.
now
if
you
look
at
the
florida
procedure,
usually
an
affidavit
is
filed,
although
it
is
not
now
required
in
the
florida
statue
but
was
filed
in
this
case.
it
is
the
usual
procedure
to
file
an
affidavit
in
the
case.
the
claimant
is
lawfully
entitled
to
the
property.
that
is
the
only
allegation
that
you
must
make.
he
files
a
complaint,
a
bond
in
double
the
value
of
the
property
and
the
clerk
issues
the
writ
without
any
judicial
interposition.
simply
a
ministerial
act,
he
issues
the
writ,
while
notes
in
a
hearing,
he
gives
it
to
the
sheriff,
sheriff
takes
it
the
home
and
executes
on
a
property.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
that
is
correct.
and
there
is
no
examination
whether
this
is
true
or
not.
now
we
submit
that
the
florida
procedure
displays
the
same
types
of
constitutional
deficiencies
that
this
court
file
lacking
is
sniadach
versus
family
finance
corporation.
there
is
no
evidence
indicating
the
validity
or
the
probability
of
the
claim
prior
to
the
part
of
the
taking.
the
statute
is
not
nearly
drawn
to
certain
circumstances
that
maybe
have
extreme
interest
to
the
creditor.
there
is
no
need
for
the
credit
to
allege
a
particular
state
interest
that
is
of
concern
to
him,
and
it
is
the
use
of
the
property
here
as
it
was
in
sniadach,
it
is
of
concern.
it
is
use
of
the
property
itself.
there
is
a
property
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
we
are
talking
about.
i
mean
in
fact
the
contract
between
margarita
fuentes
and
firestone
stores
is
simply
this
that
she
said,
i
will
pay
you
more
money
than
the
cash
price
of
these
goods
over
period
of
time,
in
order
that
i
might
have
the
goods
immediately
as
exactly
what
i
am
paying
for,
i
am
paying
for
the
use
of
those
goods.
i
agree
you
to
pay
you
a
finance
charge
so
that
i
may
have
them
now.
and
it
is
the
use
of
the
goods
that
she
is
entitled
to
until
she
defaults.
but
here
under
this
procedure
there
is
no
need
for
firestone
to
prove
that
she
has
in
fact
default
in
this
procedure.
they
come
and
get
it
anytime
they
think
they
want
it
back
for
whatever
reason.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
the
bond
is
under
the
condition
that
firestone
should
be
proven
wrong.
she
can
thereafter
reach
that
bond
and
collect
on
it.
of
course,
the
bond
has
nothing
to
establish
the
validity
of
the
claim.
the
bond
does
nothing
to
mitigate
the
deprivation
between
the
taking
of
the
trial.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
no,
i
do
not
think
so.
i
mean
there
is
no
indication
of
the
claim
itself.
nobody
makes
the
examination
of
whether
there
is
or
there
is
not
a
default.
one
can
argue
that
by
filing
a
bond,
you
cannot
deter
privilege
claims.
that
if
one
has
to
file
bond
you
will
deter
those
people
who
do
not
have
a
proper
claim.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
no,
all
they
have
to
file
is
something
in
the
case
they
are
lawfully
entitled
to,
not
to
the
extent
one
brief
that
as
anything
default.
i
suppose
yes,
but
there
is
no
examination.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
if
firestone
then
does
not
prove
at
the
this
comes
to
trial
that
they
are
lawfully
entitled
to
it,
mrs.
fuentes
raised
defenses
that
show
that
firestone
is
not,
then
if
she
can
show
damages
she
can
reach
the
bond.
but
in
the
first
instance
they
have
to
show
nothing,
all
they
have
to
do
is
file
an
affidavit
that
is
all
pre
written
and
said,
i
am
lawfully
entitled
to
property.
it
seems
to
me
that
what
we
have
to
focus
on
this
case
are
what
are
the
state
interests
here
that
are
compelling
that
require
firestone
to
need
this
kind
of
summary
procedure.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
if
they
could
show
that,
then
i
think
that
might
be
significant
your
honor.
in
fact,
it
is
interesting
to
note
here,
that
in
april
when
she
withheld
her
first
payment
they
sent
her
a
notice.
in
may
they
sent
a
telegram
saying,
we
are
going
to
repossess
within
24
hours
if
you
do
not
start
paying.
then
they
waited
for
four-and-a-half
months
before
they
actually
issued
the
writ.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
no,
the
only
point
i
am
trying
to
make
is
that
if
they
are
actually
interested
in
getting
the
property
because
of
the
deteriorating
value,
why
then
did
they
wait
this
length
of
time
before
going
after
it.
i
think
what
they
really
want
is
they
want
the
money.
by
taking
the
property
first,
they
gained
an
additional
bit
of
leverage
over
that
period
of
time
to
try
to
coerce
her
to
pay
whether
she
may
have
all
defenses
or
not,
i
think
that
is
the
point
to
be
made.
it
seems
to
me
though
that
if
one
looks
at
the
interest
that
the
appellees
before,
it
is
compelling
this
procedure,
there
is
simply
no
indication
that
it
is
necessary
for
them
to
do
this.
the
state
of
florida
says
that
it
is
the
protection
of
property
of
florida
citizens
that
is
of
compelling
interest
here.
but
of
course
our
position
would
be
there
emphasizing
the
rights
of
one
class
such
as
creditors
over
another
class
such
as
debtors.
they
also
say,
well,
it
is
the
economic
life
of
the
community
that
is
at
stake
here.
as
a
matter
of
fact
though
there
is
no
evidence
at
all
indicating
that
there
is
any
relationship
between
attachment
type
remedies
and
the
availability
of
credit.
the
california
supreme
court
was
recently
faced
with
the
same
issue
just
last
month
in
randone
versus
appellate
department.
they
reject
and
they
said,
there
is
no
evidence
here
that
there
is
any
relationship
between
attachment
of
property
like
this
and
the
availability
of
credit.
and
further,
we
note
that
there
are
some
prevalent
studies
that
indicate
that
there
is
no
relationship
between
these
two
factors.
so,
if
in
fact
firestone
is
restricted,
what
is
going
to
happen?
well,
the
only
evidence
before
this
court
indicating
that
there
is
going
to
be
any
damage
to
firestone
at
all,
it
is
an
affidavit
by
firestoneâ€™s
own
national
manager
of
retail
credit
in
akron,
ohio.
the
lower
court
re-indicated
the
counter
affidavit
by
professor
william
f.
willauer
(ph)
of
the
national
consumer
law
center
in
boston.
we
did
not
even
submit
that
to
the
record
on
this
court
because
we
do
not
feel
that
either
of
these
affidavits
gives
the
court
the
kind
of
hard
data
on
which
you
could
comfortably
rely
and
say
yes,
in
fact,
there
is
gong
to
be
an
economic
depravation
to
elect
the
community
here.
but
let
us
go
one
step
further.
let
us
assume
that
replevin
is
essential
to
consumer
credit.
it
seems
to
me
that
one
can
make
the
argument
that
to
the
extent
that
you
give
debtors
or
creditors
relatively
inexpensive
and
expeditious
remedies
such
as
we
have
here,
to
that
extent,
they
just
encourage
them
to
over
extend.
i
mean
maybe
they
are
giving
credit
to
people
that
should
not
have
credit.
now
is
that
in
the
interest
of
the
citizens
of
florida?
i
do
not
think
so.
our
research
shows
that
one
out
of
five
people
simply
default
on
this
thing.
they
just
never
show
up
once
their
property
is
taken,
they
think
it
is
gone.
i
think
that
is
significant
one
of
the
every
five
people.
i
suspect
that
is
low
over
the
national
average,
i
suspect
it
is
much
higher,
and
then
if
you
look
that
studies
of
dr.
castlewich
(ph)
who
has
mentioned
this
morning
(inaudible)
find
you
will
that
nationally
that
the
default
rate
is
much
higher
but
in
florida
every
one
out
of
five.
so
i
do
not
think
they
can
show
that
even
if
assume
that
they
are
going
to
be
hurt,
i
do
not
think
they
can
show
that
consumer
credit
itself
is
related
to
public
interest.
the
amici
in
this
case
say
that,
in
addition
to
this,
there
is
a
public
interest
in
the
conservation
of
state
resources.
well
that
may
be
true.
they
are
assuming
that
a
pre-hearing
procedure
is
going
to
take
more
resources
than
there
is
now.
there
is
going
to
be
a
trial
in
this
case,
there
is
supposed
to
be
a
trial.
so,
simply
by
having
the
hearing
first
that
is
not
necessary
indicate
that
you
are
going
to
have
to
spend
more
state
money.
think
only
in
those
few
cases
where
you
have
a
really
compelling
interest,
where
you
can
show
for
example
that
the
debtors
about
to
take
the
property
of
the
jurisdiction
or
he
is
going
probably
convey
that
third
person
or
that
is
rapidly
deteriorating
the
value.
those
are
types
of
cases
where
you
might
want
to
have
some
kind
of
summary
procedure.
but
even
then,
you
can
still
do
it
on
probability,
you
do
not
just
have
give
it
to
him
and
say
we
believe
you,
you
can
say,
what
is
the
evidence
that
you
have
the
right
to
this
property?
what
is
the
compelling
situation
that
you
need
it
now?
then
okay,
we
will
let
you
take
it.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
i
suspect
it
probably
is
your
honor,
although
that
relates
somewhat
to
the
consuming
of
property
under
lien
statute
of
order,
which
has
firestone
has
pointed
out
in
the
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
of
that
state
is
no
longer
valid
aside
from
that
particular
statute,
i
am
not
just
sure
if
there
are
other
statutes
indicating
it
is
a
misdemeanor
to
move
the
property,
i
just
do
not
know.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
it
seems
to
me
it
might.
it
seems
to
me
it
might
if
you
could
show
that
in
fact
you
had
that
fear.
then
in
fact
they
thought
margarita
fuentes
was
one
want
to
move
the
property.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
but,
if
you
have
evidence
to
show
that
there
was
some
reason
to
make
that
evidence
that
you
know
on
the
broad
basis
i
think,
you
know,
there
will
be
a
point
there.
the
whole
point
that
we
make
that
there
is
no
evidence
indicating
that
a
large
number
of
that
is
expect,
what
firestone
says,
in
their
own
brief
at
page
18,
they
say,
in
the
vast
majority
of
these
cases,
and
that
is
their
language
not
mine,
in
the
vast
majority
of
this
case
statute
that
is
voluntarily
relinquished
the
property,
give
it
up
freely.
they
also
point
out
that
default
rate
in
all
consumer
installment
contract
of
this
kind
is
1.76%.
way
below
the
types
of
defaults
that
the
consumers
are
having,
when
they
just
do
not
show
up.
i
mean,
we
are
talking
about
a
very
narrow
portion
of
the
total
consumer
contract.
and
there
is
no
evident
even
indicating
that
small
portion.
there
is
going
to
be
a
large
number
if
we
are
going
abscond
at
the
property.
in
fact,
if
they
are
the
ones
to
abscond,
it
seems
to
me
he
has
a
lot
of
opportunity
to
do
so
prior
to
the
time
of
the
hearing.
i
mean,
firestone
just
like
any
other
creditor
begins
to
go
to
this
debt
collection
process
once
they
think
there
is
a
default.
you
know,
they
sent
margarita
fuentes
a
letter,
they
sent
her
a
telegram
and
she
really
wants
to
get
rid
of
the
property
it
seems
to
me
she
is
going
to
do
it
then
and
she
knows
eventually,
that
they
may
come
and
get
it,
it
seems
to
me.
but,
if
she
had
the
default
she
still
simply
not,
if
she
thinks
she
has
not
defaulted,
she
is
simply
not
going
to
give
it
up.
i
mean,
if
it
is
her
property,
why
should
she?
but,
there
is
no
evidence
over
the
broad
basis
to
indicate
that
the
firestone
needs
this
kind
of
protection
that
they
can
not
just
provide
it,
and
they
have
not
provided
it.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
i
would
not
your
honor
because
i
think
what
would
happen
is
that
it
would
quickly
become
a
rubber
stamp
procedure.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
only
in
narrow
circumstances
where
they
can
tell
proper
with
the
compelling
reason.
but
these
are
sometimes
very
complex
issues.
if
you
take
a
look
at
the
brief
of
national
consumer
law
center,
one
of
the
things
that
is
interesting
in
this
case
that
it
is
here
that
the
security
interest
that
firestone
had
in
the
stove
had
expired
at
the
time
they
got
it.
that
is
to
say
that
in
any
rational
allocation
of
payments
between
the
stereo
and
the
stove,
mrs.
fuentes
had
paid
off
that
stove
when
they
came
and
took
it.
and,
that
is
not,
not
a
type
of
defense
that
the
judge
looking
at
the
contract,
see.
she
has
got
to
have
a
chance
to
commend
and
say
you
know,
i
paid
for
that
stove
already,
firestone
has
breached
their
warranty
of
repair.
a
judge
just
by
himself
not
makes
that
kind
of
determination.
finally
it
seems
to
me,
i
would
like
to
look
briefly
at
the
fourth
amendment
issue.
under
the
florida
procedure,
the
writ
commanded
the
officer,
state
officer,
the
deputy
sheriff
in
our
case,
to
enter
by
force
if
necessary
and
to
make
a
reasonable
exploration
of
the
dwelling
in
order
to
find
the
property.
the
problem
we
have
with
that
is
again,
what
is
the
compelling
state
interest
that
firestone
has
in
allowing
the
deputy
sheriff
not
only
to
enter
but
to
enter
by
force
if
necessary.
now,
if
you
look
at
the
balancing
test
which
this
court
has
done
in
the
past,
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
weigh
the
interest
of
firestone
against
the
invasion
which
that
entails,
and
if
we
agree
with
mr.
justice
white
said
in
camara
that
you
are
going
to
have
as
much
of
a
disturbance
in
a
civil
seizure
as
you
are
in
criminal
procedure.
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
to
allege
a
very
substantial
state
interest
before
you
can
go
in
to
that
home.
again,
the
statute
is
not
nearly
drawn,
there
is
no
advance
notice
that
they
are
coming
here,
i
think
it
appears
in
with
wyman
versus
james,
resistance
with
misdemeanor
compares
to
mr.
wyman
where
if
the
welfare
is
different,
wanted
to
refuse
she
could.
there
is
no
way
to
refuse
here;
the
sheriff
is
going
to
go
in
whether
you
refuse
or
not.
if
you
look
at
the
back
of
this
case
margarita
fuentes
did
everything,
one
could
expect
of
a
private
citizen
to
do.
short
of
actually
physically
obstructing
the
sheriff,
she
told
him,
she
stopped
him
at
the
door,
she
called
her
son-in-law,
the
son
of
son-in-law
who
speaks
english
which
she
does
not,
explained
to
the
sheriff
that
he
could
not
take
the
property.
the
sheriff
comes
back
and
says
i
have
got
to
take
your
property
that
it
is
my
obligation;
only
at
that
point
did
she
let
him
enter
the
house.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
i
do
not
think
so
your
honor,
unless
there
was
some
evidence
to
indicate
that
she
was
attempting
to
conceal
it.
if
firestone
indicates
we
do
not
know
where
it
is,
we
cannot
find
and
she
refuses
to
indicate
that
she
still
has
it
in
order
to
make
her
feel
secure
and
then
they
may
have
an
interest.
but
the
court
is
not
this
case.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
simply
the
fact
it
is
in
the
home.
but
to
the
extent
that
the
property
is
located
in
a
public
dwelling
where
they
may
have
a
chance
to
enter
anyway,
it
seems
to
me
that
one
can
make
a
less
concurring
claim.
of
course,
that
is
not
the
statute
and
the
statute
does
not
cover
special
situations
like
that.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
it
seems
to
me
under
the
due
process
cases
of
this
court,
it
is
established.
switching
back
the
procedures
of
due
process
issue
for
example,
if
you
look
at
the
cases
that
were
cited,
sniadach,
all
of
those
cases
dealt
with
the
compelling
state
interest,
you
know,
fahey
versus
mallonee.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
it
seems
to
me
it
comes
within
the
general
principle,
yes.
it
seems
to
me
as
far
as
they
have
to
show
some
reason
why
they
need
this
procedure.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
i
suspect
they
will
not
your
honor.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
the
statute
does
have
a
counterbond
your
honor.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
yes,
it
does.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
think,
one
of
the
things
that
is
also
interesting.
if
you
look
at
the
record
here
it
appears
that
in
fact
what
the
sheriff
was
supposed
to
do
was
he
was
supposed
to
take
this
property
in
hold
for
three
days
and
give
mrs.
fuentes
a
chance
to
post
a
counterbond.
but
in
the
first
place
there
is
no
notice
to
her
that
she
has
that
opportunity.
i
mean,
only
if
she
has
a
lawyer
who
can
tell
her
within
72
hours
that
exist
would
she
ever
be
likely
to
do
it.
we
examined
442
cases
in
fact
in
county
small
claims
court
and
we
found
that
nobody
ever
in
that
entire
year
ever
posted
a
counterbond.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
to
the
debtor?
there
is
no
--
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
no,
there
is
no
notice
to
mrs.
fuentes
that
she
has
the
opportunity.
well,
one
of
the
other
interesting
things
is
even
though
the
sheriff
is
supposed
to
hold
her
property
for
three
days,
it
appears
from
the
record
below
that
actually
the
property
went
directly
to
firestone.
i
mean,
firestone
accompanied
the
sheriff
in
their
truck;
firestone
took
the
property
not
the
sheriff.
they
took
it
immediately,
but,
in
way
three
days
--
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
if
she
had
filed
the
bond
and
if
the
sheriff
was
still
holding
the
property
then
she
has
the
chance
to
get
it
back
until
the
trial.
of
course,
one
of
the
other
things
we
found
is
that
--
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
yes,
there
is
a
complaint
in
the
florida
procedure.
there
is
none
in
the
pennsylvania.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
there
is
a
complaint
in
under
the
florida
procedure,
they
do
file
a
complaint.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
they
do
not
in
pennsylvania.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
that
is
correct.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
that
is
right,
that
is
right.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
it
is;
it
is.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
the
affidavit
that
they
are
entitled
to
it
or
not,
and
nobody
ever
looks
to
see
what
the
complaint
says.
but
they
do
have
to
file
one.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
it
is
at
the
time
the
property
is
taken.
there
is
no
previous
notice.
the
same
time,
the
sheriff
takes
the
property,
he
says
here
is
the
affidavit,
and
here
is
the
complaint.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
well,
he
is
supposed
to.
i
do
not
think
he
did
in
this
case.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
he
is
supposed
to
hold
the
property
for
three
days,
give
her
the
chance
to
file
her
bond.
but,
what
we
have
found
is
that
--
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
then
she
has
the
normal
time
to
make
an
answer.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
assuming
that
sheriff
has
that
is
correct.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
she
gets
the
property
back
totally
--
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
no,
no,
no.
i
am
sorry
your
honor.
the
sheriff
is
supposed
to
hold
it
for
three
days
before
he
gets
it
to
firestone.
now,
if
she
does
not
file
a
bond
he
then
gives
it
to
firestone.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
if
she
does
file
a
bond
he
then
gets
it
back
to
margarita
fuentes.
of
course
our
research
shows
that
nobody
ever
have
filed
a
bond.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
that
is
right,
that
there
is
a
provision
there.
it
is
also
interesting
to
know
i
think
though
that
in
order
to
file
this
type
of
a
bond,
you
got
to
put
forward
the
full
amount,
full
cash
value
of
the
property.
and
firestone
can
file
their
bond
for
about
1%
of
the
total
of
their
charges,
say
$200.00
here.
mrs.
fuentes,
on
the
forth
coming
bond
is
going
to
have
to
file
the
full
cash
value,
$200.00
plus
a
premium.
if
mrs.
fuentes
were
a
plaintiff,
they
would
make
no
distinction,
she
could
then
file
1%
bond,
it
is
not
a
question
of
we
know,
we
think
firestone
is
more
reputable
than
mrs.
fuentes.
it
is
just
simply
a
question
of
are
you
a
plaintiff
or
are
you
a
defendant,
if
you
are
a
defendant,
you
file
a
full
bond,
if
you
are
a
plaintiff,
the
bonding
companies
are
willing
to,
let
us
say,
file
1%.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
she
is
your
honor,
she
is.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
that
is
correct.
of
course
in
the
meantime
she
is
about
--
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
if
she
can
show
damages,
she
then
gets
damages.
i
think
it
would
be
very
difficult
--
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
that
is
right.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
that
is
right.
but
assume
for
example,
it
is
not
this
case,
but
assume
she
is
about
out
of
stove
that
she
was
using
for
six
weeks
prior
to
trial,
how
do
you
show
those
types
of
damages?
the
types
of
damages
one
is
liable
to
be,
one
is
liable
to
suffer
are
not
the
type
that
you
can
show
in
terms
of
money
and
that
is
our
point,
it
is
the
taking
of
the
property
that
is
a
deprivation
of
itself,
it
is
the
significant
interest.
now,
we
are
talking
about
property
worth
about
$600.00.
she
has
got
the
right
to
hold
on
that,
now
they
show
she
defaults
that
is
the
contract.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
she
must
file
it
in
three
days.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
prior
to
trial.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
the
florida
law
is
a
little
bit
uncertain.
we
believe
she
can.
there
are
cases
which
indicate
that
she
cannot.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
that
is
right.
that
is
our
position,
yes.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
no.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
i
think
it
is
unlike
the
pennsylvania
procedure
where
there
is
no
requirement
that
you
file
a
complaint
at
all.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
well,
they
did
not
i
suppose
that
if
they
did
not
show
for
the
hearing,
it
would
just
be
just
be
a
moot,
but
ordinarily,
yes.
i
mean,
in
the
normal
course
of
events
one
would
normally
conclude
a
complaint.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
yes,
if
there
is
an
answer
filed
then
you
are
going
to
have
your
trial.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
on
the
part
of
the
debtor,
correct.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
no,
she
is
not
informed.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct
your
honor.
i
briefly
just
like
to
run
over
what
the
lower
court
held.
i
mean,
one
of
the
things
they
said
is
it
seems
to
them
that
firestone,
that
mrs.
fuentes
may
have
wage
her
rights.
it
is
a
little
unclear
from
the
opinion
but
it
appears
that
they
are
saying
that
since
the
contract
reads
that
in
the
event
of
default
of
any
payments,
since
mrs.
fuentes
has
admitted
that
she
withheld
payments,
therefore,
that
gives
firestone
the
right
to
the
property.
i
think
that
is
an
incorrect
assertion
of
florida
law.
our
whole
position
during
the
whole
litigation
has
been
that
â€˜defaultâ€™
is
a
technical
word.
default
indicates
breach
of
legal
obligation.
now,
if
firestone
has
breached
the
warranty
as
she
says
they
have,
under
the
uniform
commercial
code
in
florida,
she
has
a
right
to
suspend
her
payments;
that
is
her
right.
therefore,
she
has
a
right
to
suspend
payments,
she
cannot
be
in
default.
if
the
contracts
said,
in
the
event
of
an
omission
of
payment,
firestone
is
entitled
to
repossession.
then
they
would
have
a
stronger
case,
but
it
did
not
say
that,
it
says
in
the
event
of
default
in
payment,
there
can
be
no
default
unless
one
proves
that
there
is
a
technical
default
and
that
has
not
been
proved
here.
likewise,
the
court
below
said
that
we
are
here
dealing
with
a
peaceable
entry
into
her
home.
it
seems
to
me
that
with
due
difference
to
the
lower
court
that
is
misleading,
i
think
the
question
has
to
be
asked,
are
we
dealing
with
an
entry
that
is
coerced?
and
did
mrs.
fuentes
say,
sheriff
come
on
in
and
take
my
property,
it
is
alright,
or
did
she
stop
them
at
the
door
and
say
you
cannot
have
it.
what
happened
--
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
i
think
there
was
no
prior
consent
in
the
taking?
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
the
contract
says,
in
the
event
of
default
of
any
payment
or
payments
--
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
that
is
correct.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
not
unless
they
can
show
some
compelling
reason
that
they
need
to
break
the
sanctity
of
the
home.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
i
think
maybe
she
could,
i
do
not
think
she
did
--
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
in
the
event
of
default
--
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
of
course
there
had
been
no
default
in
our
opinion.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
no,
assuming
that
there
--
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
now
assuming
there
had
been
a
default,
it
still
seems
to
me
that
that
she
ought
to
have
a
chance
to
comply
first.
i
mean,
they
give
her
no
notice
they
are
coming.
if
they
--
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
no,
i
do
not
believe
it
is.
it
seems
to
me
there
has
got
to
be
--
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
she
has
got
to
have
a
knowing
waiver.
it
seems
to
me
it
is
their
burden
to
show
that
she
has
knowingly
waived
it.
i
think
she
could
knowingly
but
perhaps
under
proper
circumstances.
i
do
not
think
that
the
contract
here
indicates
that
she
did
or
even
has
the
kind
of
language
indicating
that
we
have
the
right
to
enter
your
home.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
if
the
written
waiver
indicated
what
firestone
contends
it
indicates?
i
do
not
think
it
does;
i
do
not
think
if
you
read
the
contract
you
glean
from
it
an
indication
or
an
inference
that
firestone
has
a
right
to
enter
their
home.
that
is
not
in
there.
if
it
were
then
it
is
to
be
a
more
difficult
case.
i
would
like
to
reserve
more
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
briefly
with
regard
to
the
facts
the
only
point
i
want
to
make
is
that
to
the
extent
that
the
appellee
firestone
continues
to
say
that
the
sheriff
was
invited
in
to
the
home
i
think
it
is
essentially
misleading.
i
would
also
like
to
note
one
error
--
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
no,
it
is
not
stipulated
your
honor.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
what
happened
is
that
mrs.
fuentes
allowed
the
sheriff
to
enter
after
he
had
made
clear
his
position
that
he
has
the
obligation
to
execute
the
writ.
she
did
not
say
you
come
on
in
to
my
home
to
say
that
he
was
actually
invited.
i
think
what
happened
was
he,
mrs.
fuentes
acquiesced.
in
fact
mr.
leon
(ph)
acquiesced
in
speaking
for
mrs.
fuentes
who
does
not
speak
english.
but
one
thing
i
did
want
to
note
is
that
both
the
lower
court
in
our
own
brief
made
an
error
in
indicating
that
mrs.
delgado
called
the
son-in-law
to
come
to
the
house
because
firestone
continues
to
contend
that
mrs.
fuentes
herself
made
no
protest.
i
think
that
is
not
true
but
in
fact
--
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
i
do
not
think
they
do.
the
firestone
contends
that
mrs.
fuentes
did
not
make
any
objection.
the
only
point
i
want
to
make
is
that
the
record
on
page
28
would
show
that
actually
mrs.
fuentes
who
called
mr.
leon
and
not
her
daughter-in-law
and
the
lower
court
in
their
own
brief
including
lower
court
were
in
error
on
that
point.
the
only
point
i
want
to
emphasize
is
to
say
as
mr.
wright
does
that
they
have
more
property
right
than
mrs.
fuentes
has
or
she
gets
more
property
right.
the
firestone
has
i
think
missed
the
point.
my
whole
point
has
been
that
what
mrs.
fuentes
was
paying
for
is
the
use
of
these
goods
and
that
is
why
she
pays
a
higher
price
in
the
cash
sale
price.
in
fact,
we
can
show
in
this
case
i
think,
that
they
did
not
have
any
security
interest
in
the
stove
at
all
when
they
took,
i
do
not
think
that
is
particularly
important
i
think
the
situation
would
be
exactly
the
same
if
she
had
made
only
one
payment
at
the
time
they
came
to
take
it.
that
they
have
security
interest
in
both
items.
the
point
to
be
made
is
that
she
is
paying
more
for
this
so
that
she
can
have
their
use
immediately.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
that
is
right.
but
of
course
uniform
commercial
code
and
florida
says
that
our
situation
in
which
she
has
a
right
to
suspend
payment.
that
is
crux
of
our
thrust,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
firestone
ought
to
establish
that
she
has
violated
or
is
someone
in
default.
i
mean,
if
the
florida
gives
her
a
right
to
suspend
payments,
is
it
then
fair
to
give
firestone
a
right
to
take
their
property
before
they
prove
they
are
entitled
to
it,
and
that
is
our
thrust.
it
seems
to
me
to
the
extent
that
the
appelleeâ€™s
rest
on
the
specialized
property
that
they
are
ignoring
the
vast
history
that
the
due
process
cases
in
this
court.
this
court
has
always
looked
first
to
the
state
interest
involved
and
then
if
there
is
a
compelling
state
interest
they
look
to
see
whether
the
property
is
significant.
here,
the
very
little
talk
coming
from
the
appellees
on
the
significance
of
the
interest
on
why
they
need
this
procedure,
why
is
it
compelling
that
they
have,
what
interest
did
they
show
that
they
needed
or
as
required
that
they
are
going
to
settle
without
it.
they
just
have
not
shown
that
and
that
is
the
thrust
of
the
past
case
in
this
court,
you
look
first
to
the
state
interest.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
it
seems
to
me
if
they
are
violating
the
fundamental
rule
--
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
that
is
right,
if
you
look
to
the
cases
--
mr.
justice
stewart,
if
you
look
at
the
case
that
have
decided
is
sniadach,
all
of
those
cases
have
a
compelling
state
interest
except
for
two,
ownbey
versus
morgan
and
mcinnes
versus
mckay
about
which
mr.
wright
speaks.
now
those
two
cases
at
least
ownbey
is
clear
involve
a
non-resident
defendant.
so,
they
needed
that
kind
of
prejudgment
attachment
in
order
to
bring
them
into
court.
mcinnes
versus
mckay
which
is
the
per
curiam
decision
appears
to
indicate
that
also
there
was
non-resident
defendant
there
too
to
extent
the
court
speaks
of
the
defendant
of
making
a
special
appearance.
those
are
the
only
two
cases
cited
by
the
court
in
sniadach
in
which
there
is
not
a
compelling
state
interest
in
terms
of
the
statute
at
hand
in
which
a
private
creditor
initiated
procedure
to
only
two
cases,
and
both
of
those
cases
are
distinguishable
and
that
you
needed
the
statute
in
order
to
bring
that
defense
in
court.
all
the
rest
of
those
cases
involve
compelling
state
interest.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
i
thank
you.
