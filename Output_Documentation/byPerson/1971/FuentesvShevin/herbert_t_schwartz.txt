mr.
herbert
t.
schwartz
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
herbert
schwartz,
the
deputy
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
florida.
i
represent
the
appellee
robert
l.
shevin,
the
attorney
general
of
florida,
mr.
george
wright,
my
co
counsel
who
would
be
representing
appellee
firestone,
and
he
and
i
will
equally
divide
the
argument.
i
should
first
like
to
address
some
remarks
to
the
comments
of
the
appellant
as
to
the
facts.
there
is
a
stipulated
set
of
facts
in
the
appendix,
which
indicate
that
the
deputy
sheriff
may
or
may
not
have
an
refused
entry.
the
appellees
and
the
testimony
that
was
taken
at
the
hearing
before
the
three-judge
court
indicated
that
the
deputy
sheriff
was
admitted
to
the
home
peaceably
and
he
did
not
force
his
way
in
at
all,
nor
was
this
a
type
of
entry
that
comes
under
the
sheriff
appearing
in
the
doorway
and
the
force
of
law
behind
them
idea
as
in
previous
case
before
this
court.
indeed,
the
deputy
sheriff
was
in
civilian
clothes.
apart
from
that
the
facts
--
mr.
herbert
t.
schwartz
there
were
no
arms
on
the
deputy
sheriff
that
were
showing.
i
do
not
know
whether
he
had
to
conceal
it.
mr.
herbert
t.
schwartz
i
am
not
sure
your
honor,
i
really
cannot
--
mr.
herbert
t.
schwartz
that
is
correct
your
honor,
he
did.
mr.
herbert
t.
schwartz
i
would
say
yes
your
honor
that
is
a
reasonable
sense
i
guess.
the
state
of
florida
is
a
real
party
in
interest
in
this
case
and
the
state
does
assert
a
real
value
to
this
statute.
it
is
more
than
the
state
of
florida,
merely
siding
with
a
credit
because
in
the
proper
circumstances
we
would
take
which
ever
side
were
just
inequitable
in
defending
our
statute.
but
we
do
have
a
viable
interest
in
keeping
creditor
and
debtor
peace
between
the
two.
it
is
to
the
interest
of
the
state
of
florida
that
we
prevent
and
provide
ways
to
keep
people
from
resorting
to
self-help,
such
as
breaking
in
and
seizing
the
property
and
perhaps
altercation
is
over.
so
the
reason
for
the
replevin
statute
in
the
state
of
florida
is
simply
stated
in
our
brief
to
take
the
property
and
to
custodial
end
to
let
the
two,
the
debtor
and
the
creditor
have
it
out
in
court.
because
i
hope
the
court
has
got
the
distinct
impression
because
it
would
be
true
impression
that
everything
that
is
done
in
florida
in
the
replevin
statute
must
be
done
by
a
court.
there
is
no
profanatory
doing
anything.
there
are
only
officers
of
the
circuit
court
or
the
court
that
has
jurisdiction
doing
the
issuing
of
papers
and
the
hearing,
only
a
judge.
mr.
herbert
t.
schwartz
an
officer
of
the
court,
a
clerk
does
all
of
this.
mr.
herbert
t.
schwartz
no,
not
decide,
but
before
a
default
can
be
entered
or
judgment
entered
on
the
default.
mr.
herbert
t.
schwartz
no,
your
honor.
but
ultimately
the
manner
is
disposed
of
by
court
before
anybody
gets
the
property.
and
indeed
the
clerk
must
be
satisfied
and
in
our
state,
clerks
are
officers
of
the
court.
i
am
not
sure
how
they
are
in
another
states,
but
he
must
be
satisfied
that
the
bond
in
proper
form
and
that
the
complaint
is
in
proper
form
and
that
the
papers
are
in
quite
direct
order
and
that
is
the
last
thing
the
ministerial
officer
the
court
has
to
do
with
it.
from
then
on
it
is
before
the
court
and
no
disposition
of
the
case
can
be
held
without
the
court
doing
something.
i
think
there
is
a
very
real
interest
in
the
conservation
of
judicial
time
and
energy
to
be
held
in
the
statute
envisions,
and
that
it
would
take
a
great
deal
of
judicial
time
and
energy
for
a
party
to
come
before
the
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
to
get
the
writ
of
replevy,
especially
as
mr.
abbott
says
in
an
advisory
hearing.
certainly
that
would
consume
even
more
time
than
the
ex
parte
type
of
hearing
suggested
about
the
court
in
question.
and
i
think
the
state
of
florida
does
have
a
very
appropriate
interest
in
preserving
the
economic
viability
of
the
installment
credit
system.
so,
they
really,
state
of
florida
sees
two
major
concepts
involved
here
one
is,
the
very
basic
underlying
question
that
the
state
posts
and
that
is
our
right
to
legislate
in
this
statutory
scheme
of
replevin,
a
writ
is
over
700
years
old
and
somehow
the
appellant
would
have
you
believe
that
the
viability
and
vitality
of
the
writ
of
replevin
somehow
ended
when
the
deputy
sheriff
stepped
on
the
front
porch
of
mrs.
fuentes’
house.
mr.
herbert
t.
schwartz
yes
your
honor,
it
was.
mr.
herbert
t.
schwartz
it
evolved
to
that,
your
honor,
yes.
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
the
common
law
history
of
the
writ
is
well-known
to
this
court
and
it
is
detailed
in
our
brief
that
this
is
a
viable
common
law
institution
that
has
been
engrafted
on
our
constitutional
scheme
of
law
and
one
that
it
stood
the
test
of
time.
it
is
not
to
be
abandoned,
the
state
of
florida
feel
simply
because
it
is
old.
certainly,
the
older
the
law
the
more
firmly
rooted
it
is
in
our
jurisprudence.
mr.
herbert
t.
schwartz
that
would
not
be
satisfactory
to
the
state,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
t.
schwartz
no,
your
honor
that
would
not
satisfy
the
statute.
mr.
herbert
t.
schwartz
not
under
the
statute
your
honor.
there
cannot
be.
i
am
sure,
as
sure
as
i
am
standing
here
that
automobile
lending
institutions
do
it
when
they
find
the
car
in
the
street,
they
take
it.
i
am
not
saying
that
we
sanction
it.
i
am
sure
that
goes
on
we
are
not
involved
in
any
type
of
case
like
that,
nor
would
we
be.
this
is
purely
and
simply
our
statutory
replevin
action
that
we
are
seeking
to
defend.
i
think
there
is
another
fair
amount
in
overriding
issue
that
it
is
before
the
court
and
that
is
just
how
far
reaching
is
the
doctrine
of
sniadach
or
goldberg.
i
think
the
appellant
in
this
case
tries
to
view
and
characterized
this
case
in
a
vacuum,
separately
in
a
part
from
its
operative
facts.
the
facts
are
that
firestone,
under
our
replevin
statute
and
under
its
contract,
had
an
absolute
right
to
possess
the
exact
same
specific
property
that
they
then
engrafted.
it
does
not
sound
ethereal
or
abstract
right
of
judgment
that
they
are
seeking
to
execute
on
and
therefore
garnish
mrs.
sniadach’s
wages
or
stop
mr.
kelly’s
welfare
payments,
those
things
that
are
peculiar
type
of
property,
those
things
that
are
needed
for
the
life
blood
of
a
family.
but,
the
appellant
speaks
here
in
conclusionary
terms
without
any
real
facts
to
support
those
conclusions,
he
is
speaking
this
case
is
one
of
abstraction
really
in
regard
to
mrs.
fuentes
because
the
factual
basis
is
one
that
wholly
supports
the
reasonableness
and
the
rationality
of
the
florida
statute.
it
was
a
peaceful
repossession
she
has
all
the
defenses
available
to
her
at
the
time
and
place
when
they
reasonably
can
be
presented
and
the
appellant
here
would
have
this
court
engraft
on
our
law
exactly
what
this
court
has
said
it
will
not
do
at
many
times
and
that
is
make
due
process
of
law
of
some
fix
mechanistic
principles
without
regard
to
the
facts
under
which
it
is
operating
in
a
given
case.
and
i
believe
the
attack
on
the
florida
statute
is
a
very
broad
brush
treatment
of
storm
and
fury
that
really
in
a
real
sense
attacks
the
very
system
of
which
mrs.
fuentes
is
at
beneficiary.
because
the
system
is
orderly,
it
has
a
great
deal
rationality
to
it.
she,
mrs.
fuentes,
upon
repossession
could
have
a
quick
hearing
on
the
merits,
she
could
post
the
bond,
and
also
if
this
statute
were
abused
at
the
hearing
and
she
laid
the
predicate
to
establish
the
abuse
of
the
procedure,
she
has
her
civil
recourses
to
misuse
of
process,
the
civil
actions
for
harassing
predator
techniques
and
tactics.
she
could
take
firestone
in
the
court
and
get
damages
from
them
for
this
harassment
and
for
misuse
of
process
if
she
could
establish
that
this
was
indeed
the
case.
so,
the
fact
that
the
statute
has
not
been
abused,
speaks
of
its
rationality.
and,
i
think
also
the
fact
that
people
know
when
they
buy
something
on
an
installment
basis
that
they
are
obliged
to
pay
for
it
and
they
know
that
if
they
do
not
pay
for
it,
it
is
going
to
be
taken
back
rather
by
the
seller.
so
mrs.
fuentes
is
not
in
a
precarious
position.
indeed,
the
record
shows
that
she
had
been
a
credit
and
installment
purchaser
of
this
very
same
firestone
store
several
times
before
over
period
of
years,
she
had
established
a
credit
rating
with
them,
and
that
if
she
really
have
some
defense
to
raise
as
to
breach
of
warranty,
the
place
to
do
it
was
before
the
court
in
a
proper
manner,
in
a
proper
case,
and
the
forum
was
there
for
her
to
use.
certainly,
mrs.
sniadach’s
wages
cannot
be
made
analogous
to
mrs.
fuentes
stereo
set.
mrs.
sniadach’s
wages
were
the
life
blood
of
her
family,
they
were
that
suppose
this
court
specialized
type
of
property
presenting
distinct
problems
in
our
society,
without
mrs.
sniadach’s
wages
her
family
could
not
exist.
without
mr.
kelly’s
welfare
payments
being
cutoff
his
family
could
not
have
existed.
money
represent
those
things
that
is
a
specialized
type
of
property,
certainly
one
cannot
say
that
a
stereo
set
and
unused
electric
range
sitting
out
on
the
back
porch
of
a
home
are
those
specialized
type
of
property.
mr.
herbert
t.
schwartz
this
is
a
--
mr.
herbert
t.
schwartz
that
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
there
had
been
some
dispute
about
the
stove.
firestone
said
it
was
fixed
but
mrs.
fuentes
said
it
was
not.
nevertheless,
the
operative
facts
are
this
was
a
stove
sitting
out
in
the
back
porch.
she
had
another
one
and
a
stereo
set.
that
partly
can
be
called
the
life
blood
of
the
family.
as
the
lower
federal
court
said
in
pennsylvania
this
was
really
the
garden
variety
of
personal
property
in
a
footnote
to
the
abstract
case.
mr.
herbert
t.
schwartz
this
is
precisely
the
point
your
honor
you
would
become
very
close
to
those
specialized
types
of
property
that
was
the
subject
matter
of
sniadach
and
kelly.
in
those
cases,
i
would
certainly
say
they
might
very
well
be
the
light
blood
of
the
family.
mr.
herbert
t.
schwartz
your
honor,
the
state
of
florida
says
that
if
you
do
not,
if
you
do
not
what
this
court
would
be
doing
would
be
deciding
replevin
cases
add
in
for
(inaudible)
as
to
precise
property,
which
property
does
come
under
sniadach
and
kelly
and
which
property
does
not
in
a
case
to
case
basis.
the
operative
facts,
i
think
in
summary.
the
operative
facts
show
that
the
state’s
interest
is
to
get
the
debtor
and
the
creditor,
and
at
this
process,
which
is
set
up
by
the
florida
statutes
does
need
those
rudimentary
standards
to
fairness
and
due
process
that
have
been
so
often
enunciated
by
this
court.
and
that
to
change
the
florida
statute’s
in
effect
would
be
to
throw
a
monkey
range
into
the
works
of
an
orderly
state
process
and
an
economic
process
in
which
both
parties
are
eminently
aware
of
their
rights
and
duties.
thank
you,
your
honor.

before
the
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
to
get
the
writ
of
replevy,
especially
as
mr.
abbott
says
in
an
advisory
hearing.
certainly
that
would
consume
even
more
time
than
the
ex
parte
type
of
hearing
suggested
about
the
court
in
question.
and
i
think
the
state
of
florida
does
have
a
very
appropriate
interest
in
preserving
the
economic
viability
of
the
installment
credit
system.
so,
they
really,
state
of
florida
sees
two
major
concepts
involved
here
one
is,
the
very
basic
underlying
question
that
the
state
posts
and
that
is
our
right
to
legislate
in
this
statutory
scheme
of
replevin,
a
writ
is
over
700
years
old
and
somehow
the
appellant
would
have
you
believe
that
the
viability
and
vitality
of
the
writ
of
replevin
somehow
ended
when
the
deputy
sheriff
stepped
on
the
front
porch
of
mrs.
fuentes’
house.
mr.
herbert
t.
schwartz
yes
your
honor,
it
was.
mr.
herbert
t.
schwartz
it
evolved
to
that,
your
honor,
yes.
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
the
common
law
history
of
the
writ
is
well-known
to
this
court
and
it
is
detailed
in
our
brief
that
this
is
a
viable
common
law
institution
that
has
been
engrafted
on
our
constitutional
scheme
of
law
and
one
that
it
stood
the
test
of
time.
it
is
not
to
be
abandoned,
the
state
of
florida
feel
simply
because
it
is
old.
certainly,
the
older
the
law
the
more
firmly
rooted
it
is
in
our
jurisprudence.
mr.
herbert
t.
schwartz
that
would
not
be
satisfactory
to
the
state,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
t.
schwartz
no,
your
honor
that
would
not
satisfy
the
statute.
mr.
herbert
t.
schwartz
not
under
the
statute
your
honor.
there
cannot
be.
i
am
sure,
as
sure
as
i
am
standing
here
that
automobile
lending
institutions
do
it
when
they
find
the
car
in
the
street,
they
take
it.
i
am
not
saying
that
we
sanction
it.
i
am
sure
that
goes
on
we
are
not
involved
in
any
type
of
case
like
that,
nor
would
we
be.
this
is
purely
and
simply
our
statutory
replevin
action
that
we
are
seeking
to
defend.
i
think
there
is
another
fair
amount
in
overriding
issue
that
it
is
before
the
court
and
that
is
just
how
far
reaching
is
the
doctrine
of
sniadach
or
goldberg.
i
think
the
appellant
in
this
case
tries
to
view
and
characterized
this
case
in
a
vacuum,
separately
in
a
part
from
its
operative
facts.
the
facts
are
that
firestone,
under
our
replevin
statute
and
under
its
contract,
had
an
absolute
right
to
possess
the
exact
same
specific
property
that
they
then
engrafted.
it
does
not
sound
ethereal
or
abstract
right
of
judgment
that
they
are
seeking
to
execute
on
and
therefore
garnish
mrs.
sniadach’s
wages
or
stop
mr.
kelly’s
welfare
payments,
those
things
that
are
peculiar
type
of
property,
those
things
that
are
needed
for
the
life
blood
of
a
family.
but,
the
appellant
speaks
here
in
conclusionary
terms
without
any
real
facts
to
support
those
conclusions,
he
is
speaking
this
case
is
one
of
abstraction
really
in
regard
to
mrs.
fuentes
because
the
factual
basis
is
one
that
wholly
supports
the
reasonableness
and
the
rationality
of
the
florida
statute.
it
was
a
peaceful
repossession
she
has
all
the
defenses
available
to
her
at
the
time
and
place
when
they
reasonably
can
be
presented
and
the
appellant
here
would
have
this
court
engraft
on
our
law
exactly
what
this
court
has
said
it
will
not
do
at
many
times
and
that
is
make
due
process
of
law
of
some
fix
mechanistic
principles
without
regard
to
the
facts
under
which
it
is
operating
in
a
given
case.
and
i
believe
the
attack
on
the
florida
statute
is
a
very
broad
brush
treatment
of
storm
and
fury
that
really
in
a
real
sense
attacks
the
very
system
of
which
mrs.
fuentes
is
at
beneficiary.
because
the
system
is
orderly,
it
has
a
great
deal
rationality
to
it.
she,
mrs.
fuentes,
upon
repossession
could
have
a
quick
hearing
on
the
merits,
she
could
post
the
bond,
and
also
if
this
statute
were
abused
at
the
hearing
and
she
laid
the
predicate
to
establish
the
abuse
of
the
procedure,
she
has
her
civil
recourses
to
misuse
of
process,
the
civil
actions
for
harassing
predator
techniques
and
tactics.
she
could
take
firestone
in
the
court
and
get
damages
from
them
for
this
harassment
and
for
misuse
of
process
if
she
could
establish
that
this
was
indeed
the
case.
so,
the
fact
that
the
statute
has
not
been
abused,
speaks
of
its
rationality.
and,
i
think
also
the
fact
that
people
know
when
they
buy
something
on
an
installment
basis
that
they
are
obliged
to
pay
for
it
and
they
know
that
if
they
do
not
pay
for
it,
it
is
going
to
be
taken
back
rather
by
the
seller.
so
mrs.
fuentes
is
not
in
a
precarious
position.
indeed,
the
record
shows
that
she
had
been
a
credit
and
installment
purchaser
of
this
very
same
firestone
store
several
times
before
over
period
of
years,
she
had
established
a
credit
rating
with
them,
and
that
if
she
really
have
some
defense
to
raise
as
to
breach
of
warranty,
the
place
to
do
it
was
before
the
court
in
a
proper
manner,
in
a
proper
case,
and
the
forum
was
there
for
her
to
use.
certainly,
mrs.
sniadach’s
wages
cannot
be
made
analogous
to
mrs.
fuentes
stereo
set.
mrs.
sniadach’s
wages
were
the
life
blood
of
her
family,
they
were
that
suppose
this
court
specialized
type
of
property
presenting
distinct
problems
in
our
society,
without
mrs.
sniadach’s
wages
her
family
could
not
exist.
without
mr.
kelly’s
welfare
payments
being
cutoff
his
family
could
not
have
existed.
money
represent
those
things
that
is
a
specialized
type
of
property,
certainly
one
cannot
say
that
a
stereo
set
and
unused
electric
range
sitting
out
on
the
back
porch
of
a
home
are
those
specialized
type
of
property.
mr.
herbert
t.
schwartz
this
is
a
--
mr.
herbert
t.
schwartz
that
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
there
had
been
some
dispute
about
the
stove.
firestone
said
it
was
fixed
but
mrs.
fuentes
said
it
was
not.
nevertheless,
the
operative
facts
are
this
was
a
stove
sitting
out
in
the
back
porch.
she
had
another
one
and
a
stereo
set.
that
partly
can
be
called
the
life
blood
of
the
family.
as
the
lower
federal
court
said
in
pennsylvania
this
was
really
the
garden
variety
of
personal
property
in
a
footnote
to
the
abstract
case.
mr.
herbert
t.
schwartz
this
is
precisely
the
point
your
honor
you
would
become
very
close
to
those
specialized
types
of
property
that
was
the
subject
matter
of
sniadach
and
kelly.
in
those
cases,
i
would
certainly
say
they
might
very
well
be
the
light
blood
of
the
family.
mr.
herbert
t.
schwartz
your
honor,
the
state
of
florida
says
that
if
you
do
not,
if
you
do
not
what
this
court
would
be
doing
would
be
deciding
replevin
cases
add
in
for
(inaudible)
as
to
precise
property,
which
property
does
come
under
sniadach
and
kelly
and
which
property
does
not
in
a
case
to
case
basis.
the
operative
facts,
i
think
in
summary.
the
operative
facts
show
that
the
state’s
interest
is
to
get
the
debtor
and
the
creditor,
and
at
this
process,
which
is
set
up
by
the
florida
statutes
does
need
those
rudimentary
standards
to
fairness
and
due
process
that
have
been
so
often
enunciated
by
this
court.
and
that
to
change
the
florida
statute’s
in
effect
would
be
to
throw
a
monkey
range
into
the
works
of
an
orderly
state
process
and
an
economic
process
in
which
both
parties
are
eminently
aware
of
their
rights
and
duties.
thank
you,
your
honor.
