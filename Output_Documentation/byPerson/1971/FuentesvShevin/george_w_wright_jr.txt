mr.
george
w.
wright,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
proceeding
to
discuss
the
appellant’s
due
process
complaints
as
they
relate
to
this
case,
i
would
like
to
clarify
one
or
two
matters
that
have
been
here
before
discussed
by
counsel
for
appellant.
he
has
asserted
in
argument
before
the
court
that
there
were
complaints
about
the
performance
of
the
stove
in
question,
and
has
asserted
here
in
all
argument
that
that
was
the
reason
for
mrs.
fuentes
withholding
payment
on
the
installment
contract.
when
we
were
requested
by
the
three-judge
federal
court
below
to
confer
it
for
the
purpose
of
stipulating
to
as
many
facts
as
we
could
to
ease
the
burden
of
that
court
in
resolving
this
case,
mr.
abbott,
counsel
for
the
plaintiff
asserted
and
it
reflected
in
this
stipulation
that
he
made
a
contention
that
there
was
some
difficulty
with
the
stove
and
that
his
client
was
not
satisfied
with
the
repairs
that
were
made
by
firestone.
because
of
the
fact
that
such
assertion
was
made
by
counsel
in
that
stipulation,
the
three-judge
federal
court
below
set
down
an
evidentiary
hearing
for
the
purpose
of
allowing
either
or
both
parties
to
this
cause
to
adduce
before
that
court
evidence
on
any
matters
on
which
they
may
not
be
able
to
be
stipulated.
at
that
evidentiary
hearing
despite
inquiry
by
that
court
of
mr.
abbott,
he
declined
to
adduce
any
evidence
to
support
his
unsupported
contentions
that
the
stove
was
in
fact
defective
or
have
not
been
properly
repaired.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
reflect
in
one
order
that
the
reason
for
mrs.
fuentes
withholding
payment
for
the
stove
or
for
the
merchandise
purchase
was
because
of
a
defect
or
a
failure
to
properly
repair.
the
next
point
i
would
like
to
mention
in
respect
to
a
factual
statement
and
that
is
as
to
the
fourth
amendment
contention.
counsel
for
appellate
implies
and
has
throughout
his
brief
implied
that
there
may
have
been
some
forcible
entry
in
the
service
of
the
particular
replevin
writ
here
involved.
that
is
a
far
cry
from
the
undisputed
facts
here.
not
only
was
a
peaceable
repossession,
the
deputy
himself
was
invited
in
to
the
fuentes
home.
there
is
only
a
dispute
as
to
the
time
of
the
invitation
of
the
deputy
into
the
home
but
there
is
no
dispute
and
it
is
conceded
that
prior
to
the
actual
service
of
the
writ,
the
deputy
was
invited
in
to
the
fuentes
home.
there
was
no
objection
by
mrs.
fuentes
herself;
there
was
a
question
raised
by
her
daughter-in-law,
who
happened
to
be
in
the
home
with
her
about
the
right
of
the
sheriff
to
repossess
the
merchandise.
the
sheriff
awaited
the
daughter-in-law’s
call
to
mrs.
fuentes’
son-in-law
who
then
sought
the
advice
of
counsel
and
the
sheriff
stood
there
during
this
period
of
time
which
must
have
been
some
30
minutes
or
so
when
all
of
these
was
going
on
and
the
son-in-law
came
to
the
home
and
advice
the
sheriff
that
he
had
talked
with
his
counsel
and
that
his
counsel
said
he
could
not
take
back
merchandise
unless
there
was
an
actual
court
proceeding
pending.
at
which
point,
of
course
the
deputy
explained
that
there
was
a
court
proceeding
pending
at
which
point
all
parties
involved
retracted
and
failed
to
raise
any
objection
to
the
repossession
of
the
merchandise.
one
matter
i
would
also
like
to
clarify
--
mr.
george
w.
wright,
jr.
there
was
a
complain
--
mr.
george
w.
wright,
jr.
yes
sir.
and
the
complain
in
replevin,
mr.
justice
white,
is
stated
the
basis
of
the
claim
that
she
had
defaulted
on
the
installment
contract
for
the
purchase
of
the
stove
and
it
was
asserted
what
her
default
was
in
the
balance
owed
upon
that
obligation
as
reflected
by
the
contract
--
mr.
george
w.
wright,
jr.
yes,
the
complaint
had
to
be
filed
under
our
statute
in
order
for
the
clerk
to
issue
a
writ
of
replevin.
mr.
george
w.
wright,
jr.
our
statute
no
longer
as
mr.
abbott
pointed
out
requires
an
affidavit
but
in
fact
one
was
filed
with
this
complaint.
but
our
statute
does
require
the
filing
of
a
complaint
at
that
is
the
actual
institution
of
a
lawsuit
before
the
clerk
is
empowered
to
issue
a
writ
of
replevin,
and
of
course
the
replevin
party
must
file
with
the
clerk
a
bond
in
twice
the
value
of
the
property
sought
to
be
repossessed.
mr.
george
w.
wright,
jr.
i
think
he
has
referenced
to
the
fact
he
filed
an
affidavit
in
the
court
below
to
the
fact
that,
i
think
most
of
the
practice
or
the
practice
of
most
bonding
companies
in
florida
require
the
defendants
who
post
forth
coming
bonds
to
actually
collateralize
the
bond
by
putting
up
the
value
of
the
bond
itself
as
security
where
they
apparently
do
not
require
full
collateralization
of
the
replevin
bond
itself.
that
is
a
matter
of
practice.
mr.
george
w.
wright,
jr.
yes,
the
face
amount
of
the
bond
is
exactly
the
same.
if
there
are
abuses
in
the
bonding
company’s
procedures
or
charges
we
of
course
would
submit
that
would
be
matter
for
legislative
direction
and
not
for
a
constitutional
strike
down
of
this
statute
on
the
basis
of
the
fourth
amendment
violation.
i
would
like
to
mention
the
fact
that
in
our
brief
before
this
court
we
have
dealt
somewhat
with
the
economic
aspects
of
the
secured
sales
transaction.
our
purpose
in
doing
so
is
not
because
i
purport
to
be
an
expert
in
the
field
of
economics
which
is
somewhat
a
complicated
field,
but
to
point
out
i
think
significantly
that
the
property
interest
in
the
collateral
sale,
collateral
which
forms
subject
matter
of
the
installment
sale,
is
vitally
different
from
those
involved
in
wage
garnishments
which
were
involved
in
sniadach
and
welfare
termination
payments
which
were
involved
in
the
goldberg-kelly
case.
and
secondly,
because
the
impact
of
altering
or
in
fact
eliminating
some
repossession
remedies
is
conceivably
so
great
that
it
should
not
be
done
by
constitutional
sweeping,
constitutional
attacks
upon
a
long
acquiesced
in
and
honored
remedy
such
as
replevin
certainly
in
absence
of
compelling
judicial
precedent.
we
submit
that
there
is
no
compelling
judicial
precedent
of
this
court
that
would
require
a
constitutional
strike
down
of
this
statute
on
the
basis
of
due
process
contentions.
the
times
when
this
court
has
had
before,
the
question
and
the
validity
of
the
remedies
or
prejudgment
attachments
generally
such
as
in
mckay
against
mcinnes,
this
court
has
approved
them
and
only
in
sniadach
has
the
court
disapproved
any
prejudgment
attachment
remedy
or
general
attachment
remedy
and
that
of
course
dealt
with
the
question
of
garnishment.
the
basis
there
being
of
course
as
mr.
schwartz
has
emphasized
that
involved
as
the
court
stated
a
specialize
type
of
property
wages
in
which
the
court
has
describe
there
and
in
goldberg
as
the
very
means
by
which
to
live.
both
in
the
economic
and
legal
aspects
of
the
secured
sales
transaction
we
submit
bear
consideration
in
considering
the
due
process
contentions
asserted
here
by
the
appellant.
the
respected
property
rights
of
course
of
the
secured
seller
and
purchaser
are
vitality
different
from
those
involved
in
a
prejudgment
garnishment.
for
example,
family
finance
has
no
contractual
interest
or
legal
interest
in
the
wages
of
mrs.
sniadach.
it
has
none
certainly
until
after
judgment
is
entered
upon
the
debt
if
there
be
a
judgment
ever
entered
upon
a
debt.
of
course,
there
is
no
contractual
relationship
involved
in
the
goldberg
situation,
but
in
the
secured
sales
transaction
there
is
a
contractual
relationship
involved
which
gives
the
creditor,
we
submit,
certainly
and
equally
if
not
greater
property
right
in
the
collateral
as
the
debtor,
and
it
is
for
the
protection
of
the
creditor
and
the
debtor
that
replevin
remedies
have
been
approved,
have
been
enacted,
and
have
been
followed,
and
have
been
acquiesced
in
for
centuries
of
time.
mr.
george
w.
wright,
jr.
the
remedy
mr.
justice
stewart
would
be
legally
available
on
the
florida
statute,
yes
sir.
mr.
george
w.
wright,
jr.
no
sir,
you
cannot
say
that
in
every
conceivable
factual
situation
that
that
would
be
the
case.
we
have
adduced
in
our
brief
and
appendix
to
our
brief,
statistics
reflecting
in
so
many
instances
that
for
--
particularly
in
automobiles
for
example
that
for
the
greater
proportion
of
the
ordinary
automobile,
the
term
of
the
automobile
loan
that
the
value
of
the
collateral
itself
or
the
resale
value
of
the
collateral
itself
is
much
less
than
the
balance
owed
on
the
debt.
for
example,
if
i
recall
correctly
and
if
it
is
reflected
in
our
brief
that
on
a
36-month
automobile
loan
that
for
the
first
22
months,
the
wholesale
or
resale
value
of
the
automobile
is
less
than
the
balance
due
on
the
36-month
loan
debt.
mr.
george
w.
wright,
jr.
that
is
correct.
i
would
assume
that
if
the
contract
provide
the
course
that
interest
is
being
--
payments
are
being
applied
first
to
interest
and
then
the
principal
which
i
trust
is
probably
case
in
most
such
transaction.
we
submit
further
that
the
sniadach
situation
or
sniadach
ruling
should
not
be
extended
to
all
types
of
tangible
personal
property
and
to
the
replevin
of
the
counsel
for
appellate
would
here
assert.
indeed,
i
think
that
this
court
expressly
recognized
in
sniadach
that
it
was
not
intended
to
extend
its
doctrine
to
all
of
prejudgment
attachments
in
general.
the
court
stated
there
that
a
procedural
rule
that
may
suit
due
process
or
satisfy
due
process
or
attachments
in
general
citing
its
prior
decision
in
the
mckay
versus
mcinnes
which
upheld
on
due
process
claims
constitutionality
of
prejudgment
attachments
statutes
of
maine
does
not
necessarily
satisfy
procedural
due
process
in
every
case.
and
every
case
in
sniadach
involved
of
course
the
specialized
type
of
property
that
the
court
recognized
warranted
a
specific
conclusion
breached
in
that
decision.
the
same
holds
true
in
an
essence
we
submit
for
the
court’s
holding
in
the
goldberg
decision.
the
new
property
concept
there
recognized
as
embracing
those
dependent
upon
the
sovereign
for
their
very
existence,
that
is
the
persons
being
all
welfare
and
when
they
are
deprived
of
their
welfare
payments,
they
are
denied
of
their
very
means
by
which
to
live,
we
submit
is
peculiar
to
that
situation
and
should
not
be
extended
to
cover
the
situation
of
replevy
of
all
types
of
tangible
personal
property.
i
think
perhaps
counsel
--
mr.
george
w.
wright,
jr.
excuse
me?
mr.
george
w.
wright,
jr.
bell
and
burson,
if
my
memory
assures
me
correctly
mr.
justice
brennan
involves
of
course
the
situation
of
the
driver’s
license
of
the
georgia
minister.
my
understanding
or
reading
of
the
bell
and
burson
decision
was
essentially
based
on
the
entitlement
concept
that
this
court
recognized
in
goldberg
that
once
the
government
undertakes
to
give
you
something
even
though
they
are
not
obliged
to
give
you
something
then
that
person
has
acquired
such
a
property
right
in
that
entitlement
that
he
should
have
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
of
course,
in
bell
and
burson
there
was
a
provision
for
hearing
but
not
on
the
question
of
liability
of
fault.
but
i
think
that
bell
and
burson
were
closely
fits
the
specialized
situation
in
goldberg
because
the
court
did
observe
in
bell
and
burson,
if
my
memory
serves
me
correctly,
that
the
driver’s
license
himself
might
well
constitute
the
very
means
by
which
to
live
virtually
speaking
as
or
analogous
to
the
goldberg-kelly
situation.
certainly,
we
submit
that
that
cannot
be
applied
categorically
to
all
types
of
tangible
personal
and
it
should
not
be
implied
to
a
tangible
person
be
at
all.
i
think
there
is
one
interesting
statistics
that
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
from
a
publication
often
cited
by
the
appellants
themselves
in
their
brief,
entitled
“the
poor
pay
more”,
and
it
demonstrates
that
people,
while
they
may
not
be
able
to
do
without
wages,
can
do
without
things.
the
statistics
show
that
insofar
as
consumer
durable
goods
including
such
things
as
washing
machines,
furniture,
carpeting,
sawing
machines
that
in
families
earning
a
annual
income
of
less
than
$3,000.00
almost
anywhere
from
30
to
40%
of
those
families,
and
this
court’s
--
there
is
a
sampling,
it
is
about
300
families
sampling.
but,
it
reflects
that
of
the
family
sample,
the
300
family
sample
earning
$3,000.00
annually
or
less
that
who
have
these
particular
items
the
washing
machine,
the
tv,
the
sawing
machines
and
so
forth
that
they
had
paid
cash
for
them.
they
had
waited
until
they
could
save
enough
cash
to
pay
cash
for
these
articles,
and
i
think
it
demonstrates
that
whether
we
are
talking
about
rich
or
poor
that
people
can
do
without
things
were
they
cannot
do
without
wages
or
welfare
benefits.
i
think
it
is
important
to
mention
also
that
there
is
a
vast
distinction
and
a
consideration
to
be
given
to
the
contractual
property
right
that
is
involved
in
this
particular
decision
or
in
this
particular
case,
which
is
not
existence
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
counsel
for
appellant
rely
upon.
i
did
want
to
mention
to
clarify
in
response
to
a
question
asked
mr.
schwartz
by
of
mr.
justice
white,
that
florida
does
have
the
uniform
commercial
code
and
under
provisions
of
section
679.9-503
florida
statutes,
it
has
the
self-help
repossession
feature
--
mr.
george
w.
wright,
jr.
yes
sir,
it
could
have
so
long
it
does
not
invoke
a
breach
of
the
peace,
but
we
submit
certainly
if
that
is
reasonable
and
valid
and
we
submit
of
course
that
it
is
that
it
should
not
be
justification
for
striking
down
the
replevin
statute
which
does
provide
for
of
course
the
intervention
of
the
state
to
assure
a
no
breach
of
the
peace.
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
george
w.
wright,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
proceeding
to
discuss
the
appellant’s
due
process
complaints
as
they
relate
to
this
case,
i
would
like
to
clarify
one
or
two
matters
that
have
been
here
before
discussed
by
counsel
for
appellant.
he
has
asserted
in
argument
before
the
court
that
there
were
complaints
about
the
performance
of
the
stove
in
question,
and
has
asserted
here
in
all
argument
that
that
was
the
reason
for
mrs.
fuentes
withholding
payment
on
the
installment
contract.
when
we
were
requested
by
the
three-judge
federal
court
below
to
confer
it
for
the
purpose
of
stipulating
to
as
many
facts
as
we
could
to
ease
the
burden
of
that
court
in
resolving
this
case,
mr.
abbott,
counsel
for
the
plaintiff
asserted
and
it
reflected
in
this
stipulation
that
he
made
a
contention
that
there
was
some
difficulty
with
the
stove
and
that
his
client
was
not
satisfied
with
the
repairs
that
were
made
by
firestone.
because
of
the
fact
that
such
assertion
was
made
by
counsel
in
that
stipulation,
the
three-judge
federal
court
below
set
down
an
evidentiary
hearing
for
the
purpose
of
allowing
either
or
both
parties
to
this
cause
to
adduce
before
that
court
evidence
on
any
matters
on
which
they
may
not
be
able
to
be
stipulated.
at
that
evidentiary
hearing
despite
inquiry
by
that
court
of
mr.
abbott,
he
declined
to
adduce
any
evidence
to
support
his
unsupported
contentions
that
the
stove
was
in
fact
defective
or
have
not
been
properly
repaired.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
reflect
in
one
order
that
the
reason
for
mrs.
fuentes
withholding
payment
for
the
stove
or
for
the
merchandise
purchase
was
because
of
a
defect
or
a
failure
to
properly
repair.
the
next
point
i
would
like
to
mention
in
respect
to
a
factual
statement
and
that
is
as
to
the
fourth
amendment
contention.
counsel
for
appellate
implies
and
has
throughout
his
brief
implied
that
there
may
have
been
some
forcible
entry
in
the
service
of
the
particular
replevin
writ
here
involved.
that
is
a
far
cry
from
the
undisputed
facts
here.
not
only
was
a
peaceable
repossession,
the
deputy
himself
was
invited
in
to
the
fuentes
home.
there
is
only
a
dispute
as
to
the
time
of
the
invitation
of
the
deputy
into
the
home
but
there
is
no
dispute
and
it
is
conceded
that
prior
to
the
actual
service
of
the
writ,
the
deputy
was
invited
in
to
the
fuentes
home.
there
was
no
objection
by
mrs.
fuentes
herself;
there
was
a
question
raised
by
her
daughter-in-law,
who
happened
to
be
in
the
home
with
her
about
the
right
of
the
sheriff
to
repossess
the
merchandise.
the
sheriff
awaited
the
daughter-in-law’s
call
to
mrs.
fuentes’
son-in-law
who
then
sought
the
advice
of
counsel
and
the
sheriff
stood
there
during
this
period
of
time
which
must
have
been
some
30
minutes
or
so
when
all
of
these
was
going
on
and
the
son-in-law
came
to
the
home
and
advice
the
sheriff
that
he
had
talked
with
his
counsel
and
that
his
counsel
said
he
could
not
take
back
merchandise
unless
there
was
an
actual
court
proceeding
pending.
at
which
point,
of
course
the
deputy
explained
that
there
was
a
court
proceeding
pending
at
which
point
all
parties
involved
retracted
and
failed
to
raise
any
objection
to
the
repossession
of
the
merchandise.
one
matter
i
would
also
like
to
clarify
--
mr.
george
w.
wright,
jr.
there
was
a
complain
--
mr.
george
w.
wright,
jr.
yes
sir.
and
the
complain
in
replevin,
mr.
justice
white,
is
stated
the
basis
of
the
claim
that
she
had
defaulted
on
the
installment
contract
for
the
purchase
of
the
stove
and
it
was
asserted
what
her
default
was
in
the
balance
owed
upon
that
obligation
as
reflected
by
the
contract
--
mr.
george
w.
wright,
jr.
yes,
the
complaint
had
to
be
filed
under
our
statute
in
order
for
the
clerk
to
issue
a
writ
of
replevin.
mr.
george
w.
wright,
jr.
our
statute
no
longer
as
mr.
abbott
pointed
out
requires
an
affidavit
but
in
fact
one
was
filed
with
this
complaint.
but
our
statute
does
require
the
filing
of
a
complaint
at
that
is
the
actual
institution
of
a
lawsuit
before
the
clerk
is
empowered
to
issue
a
writ
of
replevin,
and
of
course
the
replevin
party
must
file
with
the
clerk
a
bond
in
twice
the
value
of
the
property
sought
to
be
repossessed.
mr.
george
w.
wright,
jr.
i
think
he
has
referenced
to
the
fact
he
filed
an
affidavit
in
the
court
below
to
the
fact
that,
i
think
most
of
the
practice
or
the
practice
of
most
bonding
companies
in
florida
require
the
defendants
who
post
forth
coming
bonds
to
actually
collateralize
the
bond
by
putting
up
the
value
of
the
bond
itself
as
security
where
they
apparently
do
not
require
full
collateralization
of
the
replevin
bond
itself.
that
is
a
matter
of
practice.
mr.
george
w.
wright,
jr.
yes,
the
face
amount
of
the
bond
is
exactly
the
same.
if
there
are
abuses
in
the
bonding
company’s
procedures
or
charges
we
of
course
would
submit
that
would
be
matter
for
legislative
direction
and
not
for
a
constitutional
strike
down
of
this
statute
on
the
basis
of
the
fourth
amendment
violation.
i
would
like
to
mention
the
fact
that
in
our
brief
before
this
court
we
have
dealt
somewhat
with
the
economic
aspects
of
the
secured
sales
transaction.
our
purpose
in
doing
so
is
not
because
i
purport
to
be
an
expert
in
the
field
of
economics
which
is
somewhat
a
complicated
field,
but
to
point
out
i
think
significantly
that
the
property
interest
in
the
collateral
sale,
collateral
which
forms
subject
matter
of
the
installment
sale,
is
vitally
different
from
those
involved
in
wage
garnishments
which
were
involved
in
sniadach
and
welfare
termination
payments
which
were
involved
in
the
goldberg-kelly
case.
and
secondly,
because
the
impact
of
altering
or
in
fact
eliminating
some
repossession
remedies
is
conceivably
so
great
that
it
should
not
be
done
by
constitutional
sweeping,
constitutional
attacks
upon
a
long
acquiesced
in
and
honored
remedy
such
as
replevin
certainly
in
absence
of
compelling
judicial
precedent.
we
submit
that
there
is
no
compelling
judicial
precedent
of
this
court
that
would
require
a
constitutional
strike
down
of
this
statute
on
the
basis
of
due
process
contentions.
the
times
when
this
court
has
had
before,
the
question
and
the
validity
of
the
remedies
or
prejudgment
attachments
generally
such
as
in
mckay
against
mcinnes,
this
court
has
approved
them
and
only
in
sniadach
has
the
court
disapproved
any
prejudgment
attachment
remedy
or
general
attachment
remedy
and
that
of
course
dealt
with
the
question
of
garnishment.
the
basis
there
being
of
course
as
mr.
schwartz
has
emphasized
that
involved
as
the
court
stated
a
specialize
type
of
property
wages
in
which
the
court
has
describe
there
and
in
goldberg
as
the
very
means
by
which
to
live.
both
in
the
economic
and
legal
aspects
of
the
secured
sales
transaction
we
submit
bear
consideration
in
considering
the
due
process
contentions
asserted
here
by
the
appellant.
the
respected
property
rights
of
course
of
the
secured
seller
and
purchaser
are
vitality
different
from
those
involved
in
a
prejudgment
garnishment.
for
example,
family
finance
has
no
contractual
interest
or
legal
interest
in
the
wages
of
mrs.
sniadach.
it
has
none
certainly
until
after
judgment
is
entered
upon
the
debt
if
there
be
a
judgment
ever
entered
upon
a
debt.
of
course,
there
is
no
contractual
relationship
involved
in
the
goldberg
situation,
but
in
the
secured
sales
transaction
there
is
a
contractual
relationship
involved
which
gives
the
creditor,
we
submit,
certainly
and
equally
if
not
greater
property
right
in
the
collateral
as
the
debtor,
and
it
is
for
the
protection
of
the
creditor
and
the
debtor
that
replevin
remedies
have
been
approved,
have
been
enacted,
and
have
been
followed,
and
have
been
acquiesced
in
for
centuries
of
time.
mr.
george
w.
wright,
jr.
the
remedy
mr.
justice
stewart
would
be
legally
available
on
the
florida
statute,
yes
sir.
mr.
george
w.
wright,
jr.
no
sir,
you
cannot
say
that
in
every
conceivable
factual
situation
that
that
would
be
the
case.
we
have
adduced
in
our
brief
and
appendix
to
our
brief,
statistics
reflecting
in
so
many
instances
that
for
--
particularly
in
automobiles
for
example
that
for
the
greater
proportion
of
the
ordinary
automobile,
the
term
of
the
automobile
loan
that
the
value
of
the
collateral
itself
or
the
resale
value
of
the
collateral
itself
is
much
less
than
the
balance
owed
on
the
debt.
for
example,
if
i
recall
correctly
and
if
it
is
reflected
in
our
brief
that
on
a
36-month
automobile
loan
that
for
the
first
22
months,
the
wholesale
or
resale
value
of
the
automobile
is
less
than
the
balance
due
on
the
36-month
loan
debt.
mr.
george
w.
wright,
jr.
that
is
correct.
i
would
assume
that
if
the
contract
provide
the
course
that
interest
is
being
--
payments
are
being
applied
first
to
interest
and
then
the
principal
which
i
trust
is
probably
case
in
most
such
transaction.
we
submit
further
that
the
sniadach
situation
or
sniadach
ruling
should
not
be
extended
to
all
types
of
tangible
personal
property
and
to
the
replevin
of
the
counsel
for
appellate
would
here
assert.
indeed,
i
think
that
this
court
expressly
recognized
in
sniadach
that
it
was
not
intended
to
extend
its
doctrine
to
all
of
prejudgment
attachments
in
general.
the
court
stated
there
that
a
procedural
rule
that
may
suit
due
process
or
satisfy
due
process
or
attachments
in
general
citing
its
prior
decision
in
the
mckay
versus
mcinnes
which
upheld
on
due
process
claims
constitutionality
of
prejudgment
attachments
statutes
of
maine
does
not
necessarily
satisfy
procedural
due
process
in
every
case.
and
every
case
in
sniadach
involved
of
course
the
specialized
type
of
property
that
the
court
recognized
warranted
a
specific
conclusion
breached
in
that
decision.
the
same
holds
true
in
an
essence
we
submit
for
the
court’s
holding
in
the
goldberg
decision.
the
new
property
concept
there
recognized
as
embracing
those
dependent
upon
the
sovereign
for
their
very
existence,
that
is
the
persons
being
all
welfare
and
when
they
are
deprived
of
their
welfare
payments,
they
are
denied
of
their
very
means
by
which
to
live,
we
submit
is
peculiar
to
that
situation
and
should
not
be
extended
to
cover
the
situation
of
replevy
of
all
types
of
tangible
personal
property.
i
think
perhaps
counsel
--
mr.
george
w.
wright,
jr.
excuse
me?
mr.
george
w.
wright,
jr.
bell
and
burson,
if
my
memory
assures
me
correctly
mr.
justice
brennan
involves
of
course
the
situation
of
the
driver’s
license
of
the
georgia
minister.
my
understanding
or
reading
of
the
bell
and
burson
decision
was
essentially
based
on
the
entitlement
concept
that
this
court
recognized
in
goldberg
that
once
the
government
undertakes
to
give
you
something
even
though
they
are
not
obliged
to
give
you
something
then
that
person
has
acquired
such
a
property
right
in
that
entitlement
that
he
should
have
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
of
course,
in
bell
and
burson
there
was
a
provision
for
hearing
but
not
on
the
question
of
liability
of
fault.
but
i
think
that
bell
and
burson
were
closely
fits
the
specialized
situation
in
goldberg
because
the
court
did
observe
in
bell
and
burson,
if
my
memory
serves
me
correctly,
that
the
driver’s
license
himself
might
well
constitute
the
very
means
by
which
to
live
virtually
speaking
as
or
analogous
to
the
goldberg-kelly
situation.
certainly,
we
submit
that
that
cannot
be
applied
categorically
to
all
types
of
tangible
personal
and
it
should
not
be
implied
to
a
tangible
person
be
at
all.
i
think
there
is
one
interesting
statistics
that
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
from
a
publication
often
cited
by
the
appellants
themselves
in
their
brief,
entitled
“the
poor
pay
more”,
and
it
demonstrates
that
people,
while
they
may
not
be
able
to
do
without
wages,
can
do
without
things.
the
statistics
show
that
insofar
as
consumer
durable
goods
including
such
things
as
washing
machines,
furniture,
carpeting,
sawing
machines
that
in
families
earning
a
annual
income
of
less
than
$3,000.00
almost
anywhere
from
30
to
40%
of
those
families,
and
this
court’s
--
there
is
a
sampling,
it
is
about
300
families
sampling.
but,
it
reflects
that
of
the
family
sample,
the
300
family
sample
earning
$3,000.00
annually
or
less
that
who
have
these
particular
items
the
washing
machine,
the
tv,
the
sawing
machines
and
so
forth
that
they
had
paid
cash
for
them.
they
had
waited
until
they
could
save
enough
cash
to
pay
cash
for
these
articles,
and
i
think
it
demonstrates
that
whether
we
are
talking
about
rich
or
poor
that
people
can
do
without
things
were
they
cannot
do
without
wages
or
welfare
benefits.
i
think
it
is
important
to
mention
also
that
there
is
a
vast
distinction
and
a
consideration
to
be
given
to
the
contractual
property
right
that
is
involved
in
this
particular
decision
or
in
this
particular
case,
which
is
not
existence
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
counsel
for
appellant
rely
upon.
i
did
want
to
mention
to
clarify
in
response
to
a
question
asked
mr.
schwartz
by
of
mr.
justice
white,
that
florida
does
have
the
uniform
commercial
code
and
under
provisions
of
section
679.9-503
florida
statutes,
it
has
the
self-help
repossession
feature
--
mr.
george
w.
wright,
jr.
yes
sir,
it
could
have
so
long
it
does
not
invoke
a
breach
of
the
peace,
but
we
submit
certainly
if
that
is
reasonable
and
valid
and
we
submit
of
course
that
it
is
that
it
should
not
be
justification
for
striking
down
the
replevin
statute
which
does
provide
for
of
course
the
intervention
of
the
state
to
assure
a
no
breach
of
the
peace.
thank
you,
sir.
