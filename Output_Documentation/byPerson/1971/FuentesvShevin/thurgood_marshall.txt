justice
thurgood
marshall
in
that
hearing
can
she
plead
breach
of
warranty?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
let
us
point
this
way,
she
can
put
the
same
defenses
that
as
if
firestone
has
recently
sued
her?
justice
thurgood
marshall
she
can.
she
is
not
denying
any
of
the
defenses,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
the
deputy
sheriff
armed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
the
record
can
show
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
although,
the
record
did
not
say
he
was
the
deputy
sheriff?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
meant
to
anybody
with
any
reasonable
sense
that
he
has
the
whole
power
of
state
of
florida
behind
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
is
what
(inaudible),
it
was
ex
parte,
was
it
not
with
replevin?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
was
strictly
ex
parte,
and
then
you
add
it
was
a
writ
of
a
vendor
return
(ph)
or
something
filed
upon,
if
you
want
it
back.
it
was
all
ex
parte,
was
it
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
would
suggest
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
submit
that
is
not
true
that
what
happens
then
is
that
the
creditor
files
a
legal
action
and
it
is
tried
out
in
the
court.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
i
understand
you
as
where
does
it
note
without
at
all
these
provisions
in
it,
that
it
is
a
good
defense
to
say
you
cannot
afford
to
pay?
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
you
are
unemployed?
is
that
good
defense?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh
you
said
he
paid
the
fact
that
they
accepted
less
than
the
payment.
is
it
something
to
do
with
roebuck,
what
did
that
do
to
sears
roebuck?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
optimism?
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
you
give
me
anything
in
any
law
that
comes
close
to
that?
if
he
had
paid
$25.00
a
month
and
you
paid
$20.00
that
is
your
excuse
from
default
because
the
man
accepted
the
$20.00?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
that
he
does
not
notify?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
could
you
mean,
he
does
not
notify?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
only
for
limited
decisions?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
can
think
that
they
were
just
coming
in
by
self-help
and
take
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
think
that
is
a
fair
interpretation?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
your
interpretation
that
mr.
epps
could
stop
them
from
repossessing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
could
be
repossession.
you
agree
that
they
could
repossess,
but
you
say
it
used
to
be
interpreted
that
agreement
that
they
could
repossess
it
and
give
them
the
right
to
stop
the
repossession?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
assume
that
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
that
contract,
then
anytime
they
may
want
to
repossess
that
it
was
really
repossess.
i
would
think
that
is
what
the
language
says.
justice
thurgood
marshall
without
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
did
not
say
it
was
forcible.
i
said
i
would
interpret
that
contract
to
say
that
if
at
any
time
if
a
creditor
want
to
repossess
that
he
has
a
right
to
repossess?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
how
do
you
have
a
right
if
he
can
stop
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
see
it
as
an
abstract
right.
