unknown
speaker
but
does
it
indicate
at
all
that
what
firestone’s
claim
is
that
there
is
a
default?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
condition
of
the
bond
though
that
if
firestone
does
not
prove
what?
unknown
speaker
would
your
case
be
any
different
if
the
stereo
are
not
kept
at
her
home
but
in
a
little
grocery
store
that
she
run?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
are
giving
so
much
emphasis
to
the
home
as
such
and
i
wondered
if
that
factor
is
influential
in
your
case?
unknown
speaker
now
you
are
assuming
that
the
standard
is
applicable
here,
is
that
a
compelling
state
interest,
is
this
established?
unknown
speaker
these
are
definitely
facts
which
are
--
and
i
am
asking
whether
this
one
comes
within
the
factual
range
of
those
cases,
they
must,
in
your
view
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
maybe
your
opposition
would
not
agree
to
that?
unknown
speaker
but
if
she
files
the
bond,
she
gets
the
properties
of
it?
unknown
speaker
she
gets
it
back?
unknown
speaker
you
told
me,
it
remained
in
the
custody
of
the
sheriff?
unknown
speaker
what
if
she
does?
unknown
speaker
well,
we
are
talking
about
the
law
of
florida.
unknown
speaker
if
she
does
not
file
bond,
she
is
still
as
perfectly
as
the
property
delivered
to
firestone
that
she
is
still
perfectly
free
to
file
an
answer
to
the
question?
unknown
speaker
and
if
she
can
get
judgment
she
can
judge?
unknown
speaker
she
gets
the
judgment
as
she,
i
guess,
gets
the
property
back
in
order
to
what
happens,
so,
what
else
does
she
gets?
unknown
speaker
after
the
bond
filed
by
firestone.
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
purpose
of
its
filing.
unknown
speaker
she
may
file
the
bond,
she
must
file
it
within
three
days
--
unknown
speaker
must
file?
unknown
speaker
and
in
florida,
must
firestone
proceed
to
bring
that
action
instituted
by
the
complaint
to
a
conclusion,
is
it
required
to
do
so?
unknown
speaker
so,
within
florida
they
are
compelled
to
bring
it
to
a
conclusion?
unknown
speaker
not
if
there
is
an
answer
filed?
unknown
speaker
there
is
not
one,
as
the
default?
unknown
speaker
incidentally,
i
think,
did
you
say
that
the
debtor
is
not
informed
by
firestone
at
least
or
by
the
sheriff’s
office
that
she
may
get
the
property
back
by
posting
the
bond
within
three
days?
unknown
speaker
and
she
--
so
she
has
to
know
that
she
had
a
motion
from
some
source
or
because
the
lawyers
so
advised
to
her?
unknown
speaker
a
prior
consent
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
what
does
the
contract
say?
unknown
speaker
--
the
property
may
be
repossessed?
unknown
speaker
do
you
say
that
does
not
mean
that
they
may
repossess
it
from
her
home
although
that
is
where
this
kind
of
property
all
exist?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
well,
i
suppose
--
you
say
you
cannot
send
in
advance
to
repossess
it
from
her
home?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
said,
she
did
say
you
may
repossess
it?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
a
different
point.
you
state
that
even
if
there
has
been
a
default,
there
is
no
grounds
for
entering
the
home.
unknown
speaker
but
your
position
is
--
unknown
speaker
but
assume
the
default
was
what
she
said
in
the
contract
sufficient
to
give
consent
then
to
enter
the
home?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
fourth
amendment.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
presumably
i
gathered
from
just
reading
the
stipulation
that
the
reason
it
was
unused
in
sitting
on
the
back
porch
was
that
firestone
--
that
it
was
a
defective?
unknown
speaker
firestone
has
breached
its
warranty,
is
it
not?
there
had
been
controversy
between
firestone
and
mrs.
fuentes
about
the
stove
and
as
i
got
it
firestone
supplied
a
new
burners
and
what
not?
but
it
still
it
did
not
work.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
mr.
schwartz,
i
supposed
it
is
hard
to
conceive
of
it
but,
suppose
this
installment
purchase
instead
of
being
for
stereo
and
a
range,
had
been
for
car
pitches
or
foods
stuff
or
something,
then
would
we
be
closer
to
sniadach
and
kelly?
unknown
speaker
you
would
have
us
draw
the
line
of
half
then
between
these
types
of
cases.
unknown
speaker
what
does
mr.
abbott
mean
by
1
or
2%
under
your
practice?
unknown
speaker
the
face
amount
of
a
bond
is
the
same
as
indicated?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
she
continues
to
pay
more
for
them,
she
has
their
use,
does
she
not?
unknown
speaker
this
only
arises
when
she
stop
paying.
unknown
speaker
but
do
you
think
--
do
you
think
this
could
be
true
every
time
that
somebody
wants
to
attack
the
case
law
or
the
statutory
law
of
contracts
of
a
particular
state
saying
that
it
is
unconstitutional,
but
all
of
a
sudden
the
burden
passes
to
the
state
to
show
a
compelling
state
interest
for
this
particular
rule
of
contract
law?
unknown
speaker
what
is
he
advised?
unknown
speaker
so
that
this
part
of
the
pennsylvania
procedure
is
apparent
first
to
be
identical
with
that
in
florida?
unknown
speaker
72
hours?
double
the
amount.
i
believe,
bond
double
the
amount
of
value
property
and
no
notice?
unknown
speaker
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
you
said
that
the
prothonotary
–-
how
do
you
pronounce
this?
unknown
speaker
prothonotary.
unknown
speaker
right![laughter]
it
is
nothing
more
than
less
than
a
clerk
of
the
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
does
that
imply
that
this
if
filed
in
a
court?
unknown
speaker
in
a
court,
just
as
anything
filed
in
this
court,
is
filed
with
our
clerk,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
we
do
not
call
him
by
that
title
probably
because
we
cannot
pronounce
it.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
well
what
happens
if
the
consumer
filed
this
double
bond?
unknown
speaker
and
get
the
property
back,
then
what
happens?
unknown
speaker
and
what
something?
unknown
speaker
that
thing
would
get
you
before
a
judge?
unknown
speaker
yes,
i
think
that
they
have
three
alternatives
as
i
understood.
one
is
to
come
up
with
the
counter
bond
within
72
hours.
unknown
speaker
so
they
can
get
back
to
the
property.
unknown
speaker
there
is
another
occasion
for
controversy.
and
the
other
was
to
file
a
praecipe?
unknown
speaker
the
praecipe
compels
the
plaintiff
to
file
a
complaint,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
where
the
florida
proceeding
begins?
unknown
speaker
but
i
mean,
you
cannot
always
do
that
as
of
right
by
filing
a
praecipe.
unknown
speaker
and
without
filing
any
bond.
unknown
speaker
within
that
period
of
time.
and
then
the
third
alternative
is,
to
yourself.
it
is
for
the
defendant
himself
to
file
a
counter
replevin.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
replevin
is
sought
for
personal
property
where
habeas
corpus
is
for
human
being,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
as
a
matter
of
speaking?
unknown
speaker
that
is
not
so
much
that
he
gets
no
notice
within
72
hours,
you
can
file
a
counter
bond.
unknown
speaker
no,
i
just
want
to
get
it
clearly.
you
said
that
your
due
process
claim
deals
primarily
was
a
fair
way
to
give
them
any
notice
or
opportunity
to
be
heard,
before
the
property
is
seized?
unknown
speaker
and
not
with
the
fact
that
he
does
not
get
a
notice
within
72
hours
and
within
which
to
file
a
counter
bond.
unknown
speaker
what
happened
if
mr.
cortese
had
--
unknown
speaker
i
am
sorry.
mr.
parham
had
--
if
i
got
the
right
name.
unknown
speaker
if
the
condition
then
be
--
to
file
this
counter
replevin,
how
long
could
that
process
go
on?
he
files
a
bond
in
double
the
amount
of
the
value
of
the
property
and
so
then
the
sheriff
seizes
the
property
back
and
the
original
claimant
has
72
hours
to
hit
the
ball
back
in
the
other
court.
how
long
does
that
go
on?
unknown
speaker
with
the
merits
of
the
case
never
determined?
unknown
speaker
well,
let
us
assume
that
he
has
a
rich
friend.
unknown
speaker
okay,
let
us
play
this
game
and
see
what
happens
and
what
would
happen?
unknown
speaker
with
never
any
resolution
of
the
merits
of
the
controversy.
unknown
speaker
how
you
ever
noted
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
have
you
ever
heard
of
that
instance
ever
happen?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
the
case;
the
washington
case
does
not
involve
a
conditional
sale
at
all.
i
think
that
is
an
argument
between
a
man
and
his
wife
over
the
custody
of
one
of
their
children
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
i
thought.
unknown
speaker
are
all
or
one
of
these
debtors
–-
are
these
parties
debtors?
are
they
main
plaintiffs?
unknown
speaker
are
the
two
debtors
agreed
they
were
in
default?
unknown
speaker
they
were
not
behind
in
their
payments.
unknown
speaker
well,
apparently
pennsylvania,
one
of
the
instances
as
personal
property
is
that
it
will
be
seized
by
anybody
else
if
he
applies
the
amount
of
the
private
property?
unknown
speaker
and
do
you
say
that
it
is
unconstitutional,
board
of
pennsylvania(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
hold
out
in
state
in
49?
unknown
speaker
but
does
it
indicate
at
all
that
what
firestone’s
claim
is
that
there
is
a
default?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
condition
of
the
bond
though
that
if
firestone
does
not
prove
what?
unknown
speaker
would
your
case
be
any
different
if
the
stereo
are
not
kept
at
her
home
but
in
a
little
grocery
store
that
she
run?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
are
giving
so
much
emphasis
to
the
home
as
such
and
i
wondered
if
that
factor
is
influential
in
your
case?
unknown
speaker
now
you
are
assuming
that
the
standard
is
applicable
here,
is
that
a
compelling
state
interest,
is
this
established?
unknown
speaker
these
are
definitely
facts
which
are
--
and
i
am
asking
whether
this
one
comes
within
the
factual
range
of
those
cases,
they
must,
in
your
view
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
maybe
your
opposition
would
not
agree
to
that?
unknown
speaker
but
if
she
files
the
bond,
she
gets
the
properties
of
it?
unknown
speaker
she
gets
it
back?
unknown
speaker
you
told
me,
it
remained
in
the
custody
of
the
sheriff?
unknown
speaker
what
if
she
does?
unknown
speaker
well,
we
are
talking
about
the
law
of
florida.
unknown
speaker
if
she
does
not
file
bond,
she
is
still
as
perfectly
as
the
property
delivered
to
firestone
that
she
is
still
perfectly
free
to
file
an
answer
to
the
question?
unknown
speaker
and
if
she
can
get
judgment
she
can
judge?
unknown
speaker
she
gets
the
judgment
as
she,
i
guess,
gets
the
property
back
in
order
to
what
happens,
so,
what
else
does
she
gets?
unknown
speaker
after
the
bond
filed
by
firestone.
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
purpose
of
its
filing.
unknown
speaker
she
may
file
the
bond,
she
must
file
it
within
three
days
--
unknown
speaker
must
file?
unknown
speaker
and
in
florida,
must
firestone
proceed
to
bring
that
action
instituted
by
the
complaint
to
a
conclusion,
is
it
required
to
do
so?
unknown
speaker
so,
within
florida
they
are
compelled
to
bring
it
to
a
conclusion?
unknown
speaker
not
if
there
is
an
answer
filed?
unknown
speaker
there
is
not
one,
as
the
default?
unknown
speaker
incidentally,
i
think,
did
you
say
that
the
debtor
is
not
informed
by
firestone
at
least
or
by
the
sheriff’s
office
that
she
may
get
the
property
back
by
posting
the
bond
within
three
days?
unknown
speaker
and
she
--
so
she
has
to
know
that
she
had
a
motion
from
some
source
or
because
the
lawyers
so
advised
to
her?
unknown
speaker
a
prior
consent
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
what
does
the
contract
say?
unknown
speaker
--
the
property
may
be
repossessed?
unknown
speaker
do
you
say
that
does
not
mean
that
they
may
repossess
it
from
her
home
although
that
is
where
this
kind
of

all
exist?
unknown

i
know,
but
well,
i
suppose
--
you
say
you
cannot
send

to
repossess
it
from
her
home?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
said,
she
did

yes.

well,
that

you

that

i

bond
double
the
amount
of
value
property
and

unknown

is
that
it?
unknown

you
said
that
the
prothonotary
–-

prothonotary.

it

we
do
not
call
him
by
that

probably
because
we
cannot
pronounce
it.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
well
what
happens
if
the
consumer
filed
this
double

and
get
the

back,
then
what
happens?
unknown

and
what
something?
unknown

that

would
get
you

a

yes,
i

that

one
is
to
come
up
with
the
counter
bond
within
72
hours.
unknown
speaker
so
they
can
get
back
to
the
property.
unknown
speaker
there
is
another
occasion
for
controversy.
and
the
other
was
to
file
a
praecipe?
unknown
speaker
the
praecipe
compels
the
plaintiff
to
file
a
complaint,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
where
the
florida
proceeding
begins?
unknown
speaker
but
i
mean,
you
cannot
always
do
that
as
of
right
by
filing
a
praecipe.
unknown
speaker
and
without
filing
any
bond.
unknown
speaker
within
that
period
of
time.
and
then
the
third
alternative
is,
to
yourself.
it
is
for
the
defendant
himself
to
file
a
counter
replevin.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
replevin
is
sought
for
personal
property
where
habeas
corpus
is
for
human
being,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
as
a
matter
of
speaking?
unknown
speaker
that
is
not
so
much
that
he
gets
no
notice
within
72
hours,
you
can
file
a
counter
bond.
unknown
speaker
no,
i
just
want
to
get
it
clearly.
you
said
that
your
due
process
claim
deals
primarily
was
a
fair
way
to
give
them
any
notice
or
opportunity
to
be
heard,
before
the
property
is
seized?
unknown
speaker
and
not
with
the
fact
that
he
does
not
get
a
notice
within
72
hours
and
within
which
to
file
a
counter
bond.
unknown
speaker
what
happened
if
mr.
cortese
had
--
unknown
speaker
i
am
sorry.
mr.
parham
had
--
if
i
got
the
right
name.
unknown
speaker
if
the
condition
then
be
--
to
file
this
counter
replevin,
how
long
could
that
process
go
on?
he
files
a
bond
in
double
the
amount
of
the
value
of
the
property
and
so
then
the
sheriff
seizes
the
property
back
and
the
original
claimant
has
72
hours
to
hit
the
ball
back
in
the
other
court.
how
long
does
that
go
on?
unknown
speaker
with
the
merits
of
the
case
never
determined?
unknown
speaker
well,
let
us
assume
that
he
has
a
rich
friend.
unknown
speaker
okay,
let
us
play
this
game
and
see
what
happens
and
what
would
happen?
unknown
speaker
with
never
any
resolution
of
the
merits
of
the
controversy.
unknown
speaker
how
you
ever
noted
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
have
you
ever
heard
of
that
instance
ever
happen?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
the
case;
the
washington
case
does
not
involve
a
conditional
sale
at
all.
i
think
that
is
an
argument
between
a
man
and
his
wife
over
the
custody
of
one
of
their
children
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
i
thought.
unknown
speaker
are
all
or
one
of
these
debtors
–-
are
these
parties
debtors?
are
they
main
plaintiffs?
unknown
speaker
are
the
two
debtors
agreed
they
were
in
default?
unknown
speaker
they
were
not
behind
in
their
payments.
unknown
speaker
well,
apparently
pennsylvania,
one
of
the
instances
as
personal
property
is
that
it
will
be
seized
by
anybody
else
if
he
applies
the
amount
of
the
private
property?
unknown
speaker
and
do
you
say
that
it
is
unconstitutional,
board
of
pennsylvania(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
hold
out
in
state
in
49?
