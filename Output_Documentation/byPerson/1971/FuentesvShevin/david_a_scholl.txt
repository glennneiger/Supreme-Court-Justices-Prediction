mr.
david
a.
scholl
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
okay.
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case,
this
is
another
action
which
is
a
class
action,
brought
by
a
group
of
consumers.
this
is
similar
in
effect
to
the
swarb
action
which
was
also
class
action
instituted
on
behalf
of
all
of
the
residents
of
the
state
which
had
been
subjected
to
a
certain
procedure.
for
that
reason,
i
would
like
to
refer
to
the
plaintiff,
the
appellants
as
the
consumers
although,
i
think
that
is
partially
a
misnomer
in
this
case.
the
appellees,
i
will
refer
to
as
the
creditors
again.
well,
again
it
is
partially
a
misnomer.
well,
what
is
in
question
in
this
case
is
the
pennsylvania
procedure
of
replevin
with
bond.
the
pennsylvania
procedure
of
replevin
with
bond
is
similar
in
many
ways
to
the
florida
procedure
which
was
considered
in
the
fuentes
case.
however,
there
are
very
important
distinctions
on
pennsylvania.
as
was
pointed
out
in
the
arguments
in
fuentes
case,
the
replevin
seizure
in
florida
is
part
of
a
proceeding
which
has
already
been
commenced
which
will
ultimately
determine
the
rights
of
the
parties
to
the
particular
goods
which
were
seized.
that
is
not
the
case
in
the
pennsylvania
replevin
with
bond
procedure.
all
that
a
creditor
need
to
file
in
pennsylvania
to
commence
the
replevin
with
bond
procedure
are
four
things.
one
of
these
things
as
an
entry
of
appearance,
the
other
is
an
affidavit
of
what
the
value
of
the
goods
are,
then
he
is
going
to
go
out
and
have
seized.
the
third
thing
is
a
bond
and
the
bond
must
be
in
double
the
value
of
the
goods
that
are
being
seized
and
the
fourth
thing
is
merely
a
praecipe
to
that
which
is
directly
to
the
prothonotary,
asking
or
ordering
the
prothonotary
to
issue
a
writ
of
replevin
at
bond.
now,
what
need
to
be
included
in
such
a
praecipe?
well,
really
nothing,
except
that
it
is
just
the
direction,
a
form
just
as
a
direction
to
the
prothonotary
to
issue
the
writ
of
replevin?
prothonotary
as
i
had
mentioned
in
the
swarb
case,
this
morning
is
merely
a
court
clerk.
all
that
the
court
clerk
does
is
to
examine
to
see
whether
in
fact
the
four
pieces
of
paper
that
have
to
be
filed
have
been
filed.
and
if
they
have,
he
then
ministerially
issues
the
writ
of
replevin
with
bond
to
the
sheriff
and
the
sheriff
is
required
to
go
out
and
forcibly
seize
the
property
from
the
consumer.
now,
this
is
the
distinction
in
the
pennsylvania
procedure,
not
only
from
the
florida
procedure
which
was
considered
in
fuentes
but
also,
even
the
procedures
in
new
york
which
was
the
subject
of
the
laprease
versus
raymours
furniture
case
and
in
california
which
was
the
subject
to
the
blair
versus
pitchess
case.
both
of
these
cases
held
that
the
procedures
involved
there
were
unconstitutional.
another
important
feature
of
the
pennsylvania
procedure
which
is
probably
distinct
from
florida
because
it
is
not
actually
the
beginning
of
an
on-going
process
which
is
going
to
determine
the
party’s
rights
to
the
goods,
is
that
for
all
practical
purposes
when
the
seizure
is
made
by
the
sheriff,
that
is
the
end
of
the
proceeding.
usually,
nothing
further
is
filed.
now
there
are
three
possible
ways
in
which
the
consumer
can
possibly
get
that
property
back,
and
these
three
only.
the
first
is
he
can
file
the
counter-bond
within
72
hours
of
the
seizure
of
the
property.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
he
is
never
advised
of
it.
in
fact,
in
the
pennsylvania
rules
of
civil
procedure,
there
is
a
form
set
out.
it
is
rule
1354
and
it
is
included
in
the
appendix.
i
believe
it
is
included
in
our
appendix,
appendix
a
to
our
brief,
and
the
form
has
nothing
in
it
which
states
that
the
consumer
can
file
a
counter
bond
to
recover
the
property.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
yes.
i
think
it
is.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
that
is
right!
mr.
david
a.
scholl
that
is
right.
there
are
two
other
ways
that
the
consumer
could
possibly
get
the
property
back
eventually.
the
one
is
that,
he
could
file
a
praecipe
with
the
court
which
would
require
the
creditor
to
commence
an
action
to
finally
determine
the
rights
of
the
goods.
of
course
in
the
intervening
time
until
that
complaint
is
filed
and
until
it
comes
to
a
hearing,
the
consumer
is
going
to
be
deprived
of
the
goods.
the
only
other
possible
way
that
the
consumer
could
get
the
goods
back
would
be
to
commence
an
actual
of
replevin
with
bond
themselves
and
get
the
goods
back
from
the
creditor.
of
course,
this
is
also
going
to
require
them
to
put
up
the
bond.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
it
is
prothonotary.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
so
you
can
refer
to
him
as
the
clerk.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
exactly.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
it
is
filed
with
the
prothonotary
with
the
court
clerk
and
to
that
extent;
it
is
filed
in
a
court.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
that
is
right,
of
course
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
[laughter]of
course,
it
never
goes
before
a
judge,
at
any
point
and
the
replevin
with
bond
procedure
of
and
so
well,
it
may
never
go
to
a
judge.
in
fact,
this
probably
never
will.
but
certainly
not
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
the
only
way
he
possibly
could
is
if
the
consumer
does
something,
files
a
praecipe
and
makes
the
creditor
file
a
complaint,
then
that
complaint
will
eventually
get
–-
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well
he
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
then
the
creditor,
it
is
the
creditor’s
move
so
to
speak.
the
creditor
is
going
to
have
to
do
something
to
get
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
you
probably
would
follow
it
up
by
planning
an
action.
you
file
a
complaint
at
that
point
because
then,
he
would
have
to
get
the
rights
to
the
goods
determined
before
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
yes,
that
would
get
you
before
a
judge.
so
if
the
consumer
cannot
come
up
with
the
counter
bond,
the
creditor
is
going
to
have
to
go
before
a
judge,
to
get
that
property.
but
i
think
the
problem
is
with
the
counter
bond
proceeding,
especially
when
one
considers
the
appellants
in
this
record,
we
have
two
welfare
recipients.
we
have
the
parhams
and
the
washington.
mrs.
washington,
both
of
them
are
welfare
recipients.
they
are
required
to
come
up
with
the
counter
bond
within
72
hours
or
they
are
not
going
to
get
the
property
back.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
that
is
right.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
then
they
will
get
the
property
back.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
yes,
but
the
trouble
with
the
praecipe
proceeding
is
that
they
will
not
get
the
property
back
when
they
filed
the
praecipe.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
right.
if
you
file
a
praecipe,
then
you
are
back
to
where
fuentes
case
is,
you
are
back
with
where
the
florida
proceeding.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
right.
exactly.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
that
is
right.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
yes.
but
you
have
no
--
you
are
not
really,
not
at
anytime.
you
do
have
to
file
the
praecipe;
i
believe
it
is
within
30
days.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
right!
that
is
always
permissible.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
i
think
it
would
be
in
any
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
i
never
thought
of
that
analogy.[laughter]
mr.
david
a.
scholl
perhaps
it
is.
now,
i
think,
we
have
already
had
some
discussion
on
due
process
and
i
think
that
the
due
process
claim
here
is
relatively
clear.
this
stemmed
during
the
sniadach
case
and
also
hearing
the
fuentes,
it
is
that
there
is
a
seizure
of
the
property
of
the
consumer
without
his
having
had
any
notice
or
opportunity
to
be
heard
prior
to
the
time
at
which
he
deprived
of
that
property.
essentially,
that
is
the
due
process
claim.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
he
does
not
get,
he
did
does
not
get
notice.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
that
is
correct
your
honor.
although,
i
think
the
fact
that
he
does
not
get
notice
of
the
counter-bond
accentuates
the
fact
that
the
seizure
is
unlikely
to
be
at
temporary
seizure.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
he
is
the
prothonotary.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
i
think
so.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
it
could
go
on,
i
guess
for
any
length
of
time.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
that
is
right.
i
think
it
is
unlikely
that
it
would
go
on
pass
the
first
seizure
because
mr.
parham,
being
a
welfare
recipient
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
but
presuming
that
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
you
could
just
keep
going
indefinitely
and
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
that
is
correct
your
honor
mr.
david
a.
scholl
i
think
your
honor
is
right
and
in
fact,
practically
what
would
happen,
but
i
was
answering
justice
stewart’s
questions
to
what
could
possibly
happen
and
it
would
be
possible,
if
the
creditor
decided
to
be
stubborn
about
it.
try
to
outlast
the
consumer
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
i
have
never
heard
of
that
happening.
the
court
below,
recognized
that
the
case
of
sniadach
versus
family
finance
corporation,
which
of
course
concerned
a
prejudgment
wage
garnishment
seizure,
in
wisconsin,
this
court
held
was
violative
of
due
process
because
it
deprived
the
consumer
in
that
case
of
wages
prior
to
determination
of
the
creditor's
rights
to
it
was
closely
analogous
to
this
case
and
i
think
that
principally,
the
best
way
of
presenting
this
case
on
appeal
is
to
discuss
what
the
court
below
said
and
tried
to
establish
how
what
the
court
said,
did
not
have
support
either
more
in
reason.
now
the
court
relies
heavily
on
the
fact
that
what
was
concerned
within
sniadach
or
what
this
court
was
concerned
within
sniadach
was
wages.
the
court,
in
fact,
holds
that
because
sniadach
concerned
wages,
therefore,
sniadach
cannot
possibly
have
any
direct
relevance
on
this
case
with
the
seizure
of
personal
property.
i
would
submit
that
there
are
two
rationales
by
which
the
reasoning
that
the
court
below
suggested
can
be
rebutted.
i
think
the
first
arises
when
one
considers
that
what
is
challenged
here
is
a
procedure
by
which
certain
property
is
taken.
the
taking
of
the
property
of
course
is
an
instance
of
the
procedure
but
it
is
the
taking
of
the
property
before
there
is
any
determination
of
the
party
getting
it
has
any
right
to
it,
that
is
really
in
question
and
should
it
make
any
difference
at
all.
whether
it
is
wages
or
whether
it
is
personal
property
or
whatever
it
is.
it
is
being
seized
prior
to
their
being
any
notice
and
opportunity
to
be
heard.
i
think
that
this
court’s
decisions
in
kelly
versus
goldberg
which
of
course
concerned
welfare
benefits
and
the
bell
versus
burson
case
which
has
already
been
discussed
suggest
that
this
court
did
not
intend
the
language
in
sniadach
to
be
delimited
or
did
not
intent
to
delimit
its
ruling
in
the
sniadach
case
solely
to
wages.
however,
i
think
there
is
an
alternative
grounds,
on
which
the
court's
reasoning
can
be
rebutted
and
that
is
that
the
property
seized
here,
which
is
the
personal
property
of
four
persons
is
equally
specialized
as
the
wages
that
were
concerned
that
the
court
was
concerned
within
sniadach.
what
we
have
here,
in
fact,
in
the
case
of
the
parham’s,
we
have
a
bed,
a
table
and
stools
which
were
simply
seized.
now
these
are
things
which
the
parham’s
as
welfare
recipients
simply
cannot
go
out
and
replace.
it
would
take
many
months
of
saving
and
even
them
perhaps,
they
would
not
be
able
to
save
enough
to
replace
the
goods
that
are
seized.
in
the
case
of
mrs.
washington,
it
is
the
clothes
cabinets
that
her
daughters
and
her
sons’
clothes
had
been
kept
in
that
were
seized.
she
was
forced
to
simply
put
the
clothes
on
the
floor
and
just
not
put
them
in
a
cabinet
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
that
is
right
your
honor
and
i
think
this
points
out
another
flaw
in
the
court’s
reasoning.
the
court
below
in
its
discussion
of
the
seizure
constantly
points
to
the
fact
that
there
is
an
extraordinary
creditor
interest
here
because
the
creditor
has
title
and
security
interest
in
the
property
which
is
seized.
in
the
case
of
the
washingtons,
we
do
not
even
have
a
debtor-creditor
situation.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
so
how
can
the
fact
that
the
title
or
security
interest,
and
the
goods
have
any
really
relevance
to
how
replevin
in
pennsylvania
works.
and
the
answer
is
that
it
does
not.
the
pennsylvania
replevin
procedure
actually
permits
any
person
to
seize
anything
from
anybody.
as
long
as
they
can
come
up
with
a
bond.
for
instance,
i
could
probably
replevy
this
chair
here,
if
i
had
a
mind
to
do
it.
i
might
be
liable
in
some
other
court
for
abuse
of
process
eventually,
but
certainly
the
replevin
statutes
would
permit
me
to
take
it.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
i
would
submit
that
the
washington
case
does
submit
an
instance
of
abuse.
all
we
have
in
that
case
and
that
is
the
case
before
this
court.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
the
point
that
i
was
making
of
course
is
that,
replevin
is
not
limited
to
the
case
of
the
seizure
of
merchandise.
that
it
can
be
used
to
seize
anything
and
in
fact,
one
of
the
parties
before
the
court
was
involved
in
a
case
that
was
not
a
consumer
transaction.
it
was
a
case
where
a
father
who
had
just
been
divorced
from
his
wife,
took
the
child,
one
of
the
children
and
intended
to
get
all
the
goods
that
the
child
was
using
in
his
wife’s
house.
interestingly
enough,
he
was
a
deputy
sheriff
and
he
knew
about
replevin
and
that
is
how
he
effectuated
it.
i
think
though
that
even
if
we
can
assume
that
--
i
think
even
if
we
focus
on
some
of
the
other
named
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
even
if
we
focus
upon
of
the
case
of
mitchell
epps.
now
he
is
not
an
appellant
in
this
case
but
of
course,
this
case
is
part
of
the
record
below.
we
can
see
how
in
other
instances,
we
are
presented
with
the
fact
that
the
replevin
procedure
in
pennsylvania
is
not
narrowly
drawn
in
such
a
way
to
merely
protect
creditor
interests.
for
instance,
we
might
have
a
different
case
if
we
were
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
there
are
originally
three
main
plaintiffs.
two
of
them
were
debtors
and
the
other
one
was
mrs.
washington,
who
is
not
a
debtor.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
no.
there
was
no
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
there
was
no
agreement
as
to
mitchell
epps
regarding
his
default.
perhaps
i
ought
to
explain
what
happened
in
the
epps
case
because
i
think
it
shows
in
other
instance
of
how
replevin
procedure
can
be
abuse
or
even
in
the
debtor-creditor
context.
mitchell
epps
had
two
separate
accounts.
he
had
a
revolving
account
on
which
she
bought
clothes
and
various
other
things
and
then
he
had
some
time
payment
accounts.
now,
what
happened
is
that
he
fell
behind
on
revolving
account
and
he
was
paid
up
to
date
with
the
time
payment
account.
so
governing
employees’
exchange
which
was
the
creditor
concern
at
his
particular
case
filed
a
writ
of
replevin
and
came
out
and
seized
all
the
things
that
he
bought
on
the
time
payment
accounts.
now,
there
is
some
question
as
to
whether
they
even
had
a
security
interest
in
those
goods
on
even
assuming
that
somewhere
they
could
produce
a
contract
which
showed
that
there
was
a
security
interest
and
goods
purchased
in
the
time
payment
accounts
for
violations
in
the
revolving
account
such
a
security
interest
would
probably
be
invalid
because
we
have
a
case
right
on
point
decided
in
the
district
columbia
circuit
which
indicates
that
such
a
security
interest
is
unconscionable.
that
is
the
case
of
williams
versus
walker
thomas
furniture
company.
so
i
think
that
this
shows
another
of
the
possible
of
abuses
to
which
the
pennsylvania
replevin
procedure
because
it
is
not
narrowly
drawn
in
subject.
that
is
that
the
creditor
can
define
what
the
security
interest
is
and
what
he
thinks
the
security
interest
extends
to
before
he
goes
out
and
replevins
the
goods.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
yes,
i
would
say
it
is.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
i
think
that
it
is.
i
think
that
it
represents
a
violation
of
due
process
of
the
citizens
of
pennsylvania,
for
checking
any
of
those
citizens
who
have
been
subject
to
the
seizure
of
the
property
without
any
notice
or
opportunity
to
be
heard.
now,
what
the
court
below
constantly
speaks
of
is
only
the
parham
fact
situation
and
the
court
talks
about
how
default
is
not
denied
here.
well,
there
is
no
question
that
the
parham’s
were
behind
in
the
payments
on
their
contract
but
they
were
making
some
payments.
in
fact,
they
had
made
a
$25.00
payment
in
august
of
1970
and
made
a
$20.00
payment
in
the
beginning
of
september
1970
and
then
a
week
later,
sears
roebuck,
except
$20.00
payment
came
out
and
replevied
the
goods.
and
by
this
time
they
had
paid
off,
i
believe
approximately
$200.00
of
the
$384.00
debt,
that
they
originally
had.
i
think
that
the
parham’s,
they
had
an
opportunity
to
get
in
the
court
and
raise
any
defenses
that
they
might
have
had.
they
might
have
been
able
to
establish
that
in
fact,
sears
roebuck
could
agree
to
accept
the
$20.00
payments
a
month
as
a
payout
schedule.
because
the
only
reason
that
mr.
parham
was
not
able
to
keep
up
his
original
schedule
was
because
he
lost
his
job.
so
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
also
that
the
replevin
procedure
is
subject
to
mr.
parham,
never
having
an
opportunity
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
no,
what
i
am
suggesting
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
that
is
not
what
i
meant
to
suggest
mr.
justice
marshall.
perhaps,
i
ought
to
explain
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
i
am
saying
that
it
may
have
this
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
it
may
have
represented
that
they
accepted
a
lesser
payment
schedule
from
the
parham’s
in
light
of
the
fact
that
they
were
not
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
i
think
if
the
man
accepted
the
$20.00
and
does
not
say
anything
about
it,
there
is
at
least
an
argument
that
can
be
made.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
not
that
he
does
not
notify
but
that
in
fact,
the
creditor
should
decease
from
taking
the
property
as
long
as
the
consumer
is
willing
to
work
out
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
i
do
no
think
that
it
could
possibly
be
asserted
if
they
did
not
know
the
balance.
i
did
not
mean
to
assert
that.
now,
in
addition
to
a
claim
that
the
due
process
rights
of
the
consumers
were
violated,
there
is
also
a
claim
made
by
the
consumers
in
this
court
and
it
was
also
made
below
that
the
fourth
amendment
rights
of
the
consumers
were
also
violated.
because
when
an
effect
is
permitted
here
is
an
entry
into
the
home
of
the
consumers
and
a
taking
of
their
goods
without
there
being
any
assertion
on
the
part
of
the
creditor
that
he
has
probable
cause
to
enter
the
home
and
to
seize
the
particular
goods.
now,
the
court
below
gets
out
of
any
discussion
of
the
fourth
amendment
in
a
very
easy
manner,
they
simply
say
that
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
apply
the
civil
cases
and
this
is
a
civil
case
therefore
no
fourth
amendment.
i
do
not
think
that
that
follows
the
teachings
of
this
court
as
to
what
the
nature
of
the
fourth
amendment
is.
the
nature
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
to
protect
person’s
right
to
privacy
to
their
home.
it
is
to
prevent
seizure
or
searches
of
the
home
and
entry
into
the
home
by
state
official
in
any
instance.
whether
the
official
is
executing
criminal
process
or
whether
as
in
this
case
is
executing
on
civil
process.
now,
i
think
that
the
several
cases
that
point
to
this
result.
first
of
all,
the
camara
case,
the
see
case.
even
this
court’s
decision
in
wiremen
versus
james,
although
in
that
case,
it
was
found
that
there
was
no
search
and
no
seizure,
that
case
reiterated
the
holding
of
the
camara
and
the
see
cases
that
in
fact
the
fourth
amendment
is
not
limited
to
cases
in
which
there
is
a
criminal
matter
that
is
before
the
court
and
i
think
other
cases
that
support
this
notion
of
the
griswold
case
which
the
fourth
amendment
is
one
of
the
grounds
given
for
that
decision
and
also
the
viven
case
in
which
it
was
permitted
at,
the
plaintiff
was
permitted
to
bring
an
action,
civil
action,
based
on
the
fourth
amendment.
positing
that
the
fourth
amendment
does
apply
the
civil
cases,
i
think
it
is
fairly
easy
to
see
that
in
this
case,
there
is
no
showing
of
probable
cause
before
a
magistrate
or
any
person
before
the
seizure
of
property
is
affected.
in
fact
in
pennsylvania,
there
is
no
procedure
that
ever
goes
before
any
neutral
arbitrator.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
i
do
not
--
neither
of
the
contracts
concerning
this
case
really
say
anything
about
replevin.
the
only
thing
that
the
contracts
and
now
this
is
putting
aside
the
washington
case
which
of
course
is
not
a
consumer
case
and
shows
out
the
fourth
amendment
invasion
on
mrs.
washington,
i
do
not
think
that
is
it
all
relevant
too,
but
even
assuming
that
mrs.
washington
is
out
of
the
case
for
a
minute,
then
we
have
just
the
consumers.
we
have
an
agreement
that
says
that
the
creditor
shall
retain
title
to
the
instruments
and
the
one
contract
says,
they
may
repossess
goods,
the
other
says,
they
may
retake
goods.
well,
title
in
itself
as
the
uniform
commercial
code
points
out
merely
means
that
the
creditor
has
a
security
interest
in
the
goods.
so
to
say
they
have
the
security
interest
then
title
is
probably
redundant.
now,
in
the
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
right!
that
does
--
a
point
from
the
contract
that
i
was
referring
to
you,
i
mean,
retake
the
merchandise
again.
it
does
not
say,
however,
that
they
may,
that
is
the
epps
contract,
if
i
am
not
mistaken.
that
indicates,
that
does
not
say
that
they
may
replevy
the
contract
of
the
property
and
perhaps
the
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
epps
contract
is
to
be
interpreted
the
same
way
as
the
sears,
roebuck
contract
which
merely
permits
repossession
by
the
creditor
and
repossession
is
not
replevin.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
they
could
attempt
to
come
there
by
self-help,
but
the
distinction
between
repossession
and
replevin
is
that
if
mrs.
washington
and
mrs.
parham
said
to
sears,
roebuck
or
to
mr.
washington,
you
cannot
enter
my
house,
or
i
am
not
going
to
let
you
come
into
repossess
the
goods,
the
repossession
would
have
to
stop
at
that
point
and
i
think
that
is
the
important
distinction
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
i
think
that
it
is.
i
think
that
is
ambiguous
retake.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
i
think
a
fair
interpretation
is
that
all
retake
means
is
repossession.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
that
is
the
definition
of
repossession.
repossession
has
to
be
a
feasible
taking.
so
the
minute
that
mr.
epps
and
mrs.
parham
would
attempt
to
stop
sears
from
retaking
the
goods,
they
would
have
to
stop
it.
all
repossessions
of
course
are
non-consensual
or
repossession
can
be
consensual.
the
parham’s
may
have
decided,
in
fact,
they
could
not
keep
up
the
payments
and
they
would
just
as
soon
have
sears
to
take
it
back.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
i
think
that
is
all
that
they
reached.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
i
would
not
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
i
would
not
interpret
that
contract
as
permitting
a
forcible
seizure
merely
because
the
meaning
of
repossession
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
i
would
agree
with
you,
your
honor,
but
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
by
definite
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
it
is
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
i
do
not
think
that
mr.
parham
can
be
held
to
any
interpretation
of
repossession,
other
than
what
it
means
in
the
law
or
nearly
which
is
a
feasible
taking
and
i
do
not
see
how
mr.
parham
especially,
mr.
parham,
of
course,
is
a
not
the
person
that
drafted
the
contract
could
possibly
be
held
to
such
an
interpretation
that
it
would
permit
replevin.
also,
with
respect
to
the
fourth
amendment
of
course,
the
agreement
is
merely
between
sears,
roebuck
and
mrs.
parham.
it
does
not
permit
the
sheriff
to
come
in
and
take
the
goods
and
that
is
the
person
who
takes
the
goods
in
this
case.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
okay.
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case,
this
is
another
action
which
is
a
class
action,
brought
by
a
group
of
consumers.
this
is
similar
in
effect
to
the
swarb
action
which
was
also
class
action
instituted
on
behalf
of
all
of
the
residents
of
the
state
which
had
been
subjected
to
a
certain
procedure.
for
that
reason,
i
would
like
to
refer
to
the
plaintiff,
the
appellants
as
the
consumers
although,
i
think
that
is
partially
a
misnomer
in
this
case.
the
appellees,
i
will
refer
to
as
the
creditors
again.
well,
again
it
is
partially
a
misnomer.
well,
what
is
in
question
in
this
case
is
the
pennsylvania
procedure
of
replevin
with
bond.
the
pennsylvania
procedure
of
replevin
with
bond
is
similar
in
many
ways
to
the
florida
procedure
which
was
considered
in
the
fuentes
case.
however,
there
are
very
important
distinctions
on
pennsylvania.
as
was
pointed
out
in
the
arguments
in
fuentes
case,
the
replevin
seizure
in
florida
is
part
of
a
proceeding
which
has
already
been
commenced
which
will
ultimately
determine
the
rights
of
the
parties
to
the
particular
goods
which
were
seized.
that
is
not
the
case
in
the
pennsylvania
replevin
with
bond
procedure.
all
that
a
creditor
need
to
file
in
pennsylvania
to
commence
the
replevin
with
bond
procedure
are
four
things.
one
of
these
things
as
an
entry
of
appearance,
the
other
is
an
affidavit
of
what
the
value
of
the
goods
are,
then
he
is
going
to
go
out
and
have
seized.
the
third
thing
is
a
bond
and
the
bond
must
be
in
double
the
value
of
the
goods
that
are
being
seized
and
the
fourth
thing
is
merely
a
praecipe
to
that
which
is
directly
to
the
prothonotary,
asking
or
ordering
the
prothonotary
to
issue
a
writ
of
replevin
at
bond.
now,
what
need
to
be
included
in
such
a
praecipe?
well,
really
nothing,
except
that
it
is
just
the
direction,
a
form
just
as
a
direction
to
the
prothonotary
to
issue
the
writ
of
replevin?
prothonotary
as
i
had
mentioned
in
the
swarb
case,
this
morning
is
merely
a
court
clerk.
all
that
the
court
clerk
does
is
to
examine
to
see
whether
in
fact
the
four
pieces
of
paper
that
have
to
be
filed
have
been
filed.
and
if
they
have,
he
then
ministerially
issues
the
writ
of
replevin
with
bond
to
the
sheriff
and
the
sheriff
is
required
to
go
out
and
forcibly
seize
the
property
from
the
consumer.
now,
this
is
the
distinction
in
the
pennsylvania
procedure,
not
only
from
the
florida
procedure
which
was
considered
in
fuentes
but
also,
even
the
procedures
in
new
york
which
was
the
subject
of
the
laprease
versus
raymours
furniture
case
and
in
california
which
was
the
subject
to
the
blair
versus
pitchess
case.
both
of
these
cases
held
that
the
procedures
involved
there
were
unconstitutional.
another
important
feature
of
the
pennsylvania
procedure
which
is
probably
distinct
from
florida
because
it
is
not
actually
the
beginning
of
an
on-going
process
which
is
going
to
determine
the
party’s
rights
to
the
goods,
is
that
for
all
practical
purposes
when
the
seizure
is
made
by
the
sheriff,
that
is
the
end
of
the
proceeding.
usually,
nothing
further
is
filed.
now
there
are
three
possible
ways
in
which
the
consumer
can
possibly
get
that
property
back,
and
these
three
only.
the
first
is
he
can
file
the
counter-bond
within
72
hours
of
the
seizure
of
the
property.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
he
is
never
advised
of
it.
in
fact,
in
the
pennsylvania
rules
of
civil
procedure,
there
is
a
form
set
out.
it
is
rule
1354
and
it
is
included
in
the
appendix.
i
believe
it
is
included
in
our
appendix,
appendix
a
to
our
brief,
and
the
form
has
nothing
in
it
which
states
that
the
consumer
can
file
a
counter
bond
to
recover
the
property.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
yes.
i
think
it
is.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
that
is
right!
mr.
david
a.
scholl
that
is
right.
there
are
two
other
ways
that
the
consumer
could
possibly
get
the
property
back
eventually.
the
one
is
that,
he
could
file
a
praecipe
with
the
court
which
would
require
the
creditor
to
commence
an
action
to
finally
determine
the
rights
of
the
goods.
of
course
in
the
intervening
time
until
that
complaint
is
filed
and
until
it
comes
to
a
hearing,
the
consumer
is
going
to
be
deprived
of
the
goods.
the
only
other
possible
way
that
the
consumer
could
get
the
goods
back
would
be
to
commence
an
actual
of
replevin
with
bond
themselves
and
get
the
goods
back
from
the
creditor.
of
course,
this
is
also
going
to
require
them
to
put
up
the
bond.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
it
is
prothonotary.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
so
you
can
refer
to
him
as
the
clerk.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
exactly.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
it
is
filed
with
the
prothonotary
with
the
court
clerk
and
to
that
extent;
it
is
filed
in
a
court.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
that
is
right,
of
course
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
[laughter]of
course,
it
never
goes
before
a
judge,
at
any
point
and
the
replevin
with
bond
procedure
of
and
so
well,
it
may
never
go
to
a
judge.
in
fact,
this
probably
never
will.
but
certainly
not
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
the
only
way
he
possibly
could
is
if
the
consumer
does
something,
files
a
praecipe
and
makes
the
creditor
file
a
complaint,
then
that
complaint
will
eventually
get
–-
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well
he
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
then
the
creditor,
it
is
the
creditor’s
move
so
to
speak.
the
creditor
is
going
to
have
to
do
something
to
get
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
you
probably
would
follow
it
up
by
planning
an
action.
you
file
a
complaint
at
that
point
because
then,
he
would
have
to
get
the
rights
to
the
goods
determined
before
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
yes,
that
would
get
you
before
a
judge.
so
if
the
consumer
cannot
come
up
with
the
counter
bond,
the
creditor
is
going
to
have
to
go
before
a
judge,
to
get
that
property.
but
i
think
the
problem
is
with
the
counter
bond
proceeding,
especially
when
one
considers
the
appellants
in
this
record,
we
have
two
welfare
recipients.
we
have
the
parhams
and
the
washington.
mrs.
washington,
both
of
them
are
welfare
recipients.
they
are
required
to
come
up
with
the
counter
bond
within
72
hours
or
they
are
not
going
to
get
the
property
back.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
that
is
right.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
then
they
will
get
the
property
back.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
yes,
but
the
trouble
with
the
praecipe
proceeding
is
that
they
will
not
get
the
property
back
when
they
filed
the
praecipe.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
right.
if
you
file
a
praecipe,
then
you
are
back
to
where
fuentes
case
is,
you
are
back
with
where
the
florida
proceeding.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
right.
exactly.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
that
is
right.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
yes.
but
you
have
no
--
you
are
not
really,
not
at
anytime.
you
do
have
to
file
the
praecipe;
i
believe
it
is
within
30
days.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
right!
that
is
always
permissible.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
i
think
it
would
be
in
any
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
i
never
thought
of
that
analogy.[laughter]
mr.
david
a.
scholl
perhaps
it
is.
now,
i
think,
we
have
already
had
some
discussion
on
due
process
and
i
think
that
the
due
process
claim
here
is
relatively
clear.
this
stemmed
during
the
sniadach
case
and
also
hearing
the
fuentes,
it
is
that
there
is
a
seizure
of
the
property
of
the
consumer
without
his
having
had
any
notice
or
opportunity
to
be
heard
prior
to
the
time
at
which
he
deprived
of
that
property.
essentially,
that
is
the
due
process
claim.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
he
does
not
get,
he
did
does
not
get
notice.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
that
is
correct
your
honor.
although,
i
think
the
fact
that
he
does
not
get
notice
of
the
counter-bond
accentuates
the
fact
that
the
seizure
is
unlikely
to
be
at
temporary
seizure.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
he
is
the
prothonotary.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
i
think
so.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
it
could
go
on,
i
guess
for
any
length
of
time.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
that
is
right.
i
think
it
is
unlikely
that
it
would
go
on
pass
the
first
seizure
because
mr.
parham,
being
a
welfare
recipient
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
but
presuming
that
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
you
could
just
keep
going
indefinitely
and
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
that
is
correct
your
honor
mr.
david
a.
scholl
i
think
your
honor
is
right
and
in
fact,
practically
what
would
happen,
but
i
was
answering
justice
stewart’s
questions
to
what
could
possibly
happen
and
it
would
be
possible,
if
the
creditor
decided
to
be
stubborn
about
it.
try
to
outlast
the
consumer
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
i
have
never
heard
of
that
happening.
the
court
below,
recognized
that
the
case
of
sniadach
versus
family
finance
corporation,
which
of
course
concerned
a
prejudgment
wage
garnishment
seizure,
in
wisconsin,
this
court
held
was
violative
of
due
process
because
it
deprived
the
consumer
in
that
case
of
wages
prior
to
determination
of
the
creditor's
rights
to
it
was
closely
analogous
to
this
case
and
i
think
that
principally,
the
best
way
of
presenting
this
case
on
appeal
is
to
discuss
what
the
court
below
said
and
tried
to
establish
how
what
the
court
said,
did
not
have
support
either
more
in
reason.
now
the
court
relies
heavily
on
the
fact
that
what
was
concerned
within
sniadach
or
what
this
court
was
concerned
within
sniadach
was
wages.
the
court,
in
fact,
holds
that
because
sniadach
concerned
wages,
therefore,
sniadach
cannot
possibly
have
any
direct
relevance
on
this
case
with
the
seizure
of
personal
property.
i
would
submit
that
there
are
two
rationales
by
which
the
reasoning
that
the
court
below
suggested
can
be
rebutted.
i
think
the
first
arises
when
one
considers
that
what
is
challenged
here
is
a
procedure
by
which
certain
property
is
taken.
the
taking
of
the
property
of
course
is
an
instance
of
the
procedure
but
it
is
the
taking
of
the
property
before
there
is
any
determination
of
the
party
getting
it
has
any
right
to
it,
that
is
really
in
question
and
should
it
make
any
difference
at
all.
whether
it
is
wages
or
whether
it
is
personal
property
or
whatever
it
is.
it
is
being
seized
prior
to
their
being
any
notice
and
opportunity
to
be
heard.
i
think
that
this
court’s
decisions
in
kelly
versus
goldberg
which
of
course
concerned
welfare
benefits
and
the
bell
versus
burson
case
which
has
already
been
discussed
suggest
that
this
court
did
not
intend
the
language
in
sniadach
to
be
delimited
or
did
not
intent
to
delimit
its
ruling
in
the
sniadach
case
solely
to
wages.
however,
i
think
there
is
an
alternative
grounds,
on
which
the
court's
reasoning
can
be
rebutted
and
that
is
that
the
property
seized
here,
which
is
the
personal
property
of
four
persons
is
equally
specialized
as
the
wages
that
were
concerned
that
the
court
was
concerned
within
sniadach.
what
we
have
here,
in
fact,
in
the
case
of
the
parham’s,
we
have
a
bed,
a
table
and
stools
which
were
simply
seized.
now
these
are
things
which
the
parham’s
as
welfare
recipients
simply
cannot
go
out
and
replace.
it
would
take
many
months
of
saving
and
even
them
perhaps,
they
would
not
be
able
to
save
enough
to
replace
the
goods
that
are
seized.
in
the
case
of
mrs.
washington,
it
is
the
clothes
cabinets
that
her
daughters
and
her
sons’
clothes
had
been
kept
in
that
were
seized.
she
was
forced
to
simply
put
the
clothes
on
the
floor
and
just
not
put
them
in
a
cabinet
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
that
is
right
your
honor
and
i
think
this
points
out
another
flaw
in
the
court’s
reasoning.
the
court
below
in
its
discussion
of
the
seizure
constantly
points
to
the
fact
that
there
is
an
extraordinary
creditor
interest
here
because
the
creditor
has
title
and
security
interest
in
the
property
which
is
seized.
in
the
case
of
the
washingtons,
we
do
not
even
have
a
debtor-creditor
situation.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
so
how
can
the
fact
that
the
title
or
security
interest,
and
the
goods
have
any
really
relevance
to
how
replevin
in
pennsylvania
works.
and
the
answer
is
that
it
does
not.
the
pennsylvania
replevin
procedure
actually
permits
any
person
to
seize
anything
from
anybody.
as
long
as
they
can
come
up
with
a
bond.
for
instance,
i
could
probably
replevy
this
chair
here,
if
i
had
a
mind
to
do
it.
i
might
be
liable
in
some
other
court
for
abuse
of
process
eventually,
but
certainly
the
replevin
statutes
would
permit
me
to
take
it.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
i
would
submit
that
the
washington
case
does
submit
an
instance
of
abuse.
all
we
have
in
that
case
and
that
is
the
case
before
this
court.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
the
point
that
i
was
making
of
course
is
that,
replevin
is
not
limited
to
the
case
of
the
seizure
of
merchandise.
that
it
can
be
used
to
seize
anything
and
in
fact,
one
of
the
parties
before
the
court
was
involved
in
a
case
that
was
not
a
consumer
transaction.
it
was
a
case
where
a
father
who
had
just
been
divorced
from
his
wife,
took
the
child,
one
of
the
children
and
intended
to
get
all
the
goods
that
the
child
was
using
in
his
wife’s
house.
interestingly
enough,
he
was
a
deputy
sheriff
and
he
knew
about
replevin
and
that
is
how
he
effectuated
it.
i
think
though
that
even
if
we
can
assume
that
--
i
think
even
if
we
focus
on
some
of
the
other
named
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
even
if
we
focus
upon
of
the
case
of
mitchell
epps.
now
he
is
not
an
appellant
in
this
case
but
of
course,
this
case
is
part
of
the
record
below.
we
can
see
how
in
other
instances,
we
are
presented
with
the
fact
that
the
replevin
procedure
in
pennsylvania
is
not
narrowly
drawn
in
such
a
way
to
merely
protect
creditor
interests.
for
instance,
we
might
have
a
different
case
if
we
were
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
there
are
originally
three
main
plaintiffs.
two
of
them
were
debtors
and
the
other
one
was
mrs.
washington,
who
is
not
a
debtor.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
no.
there
was
no
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
there
was
no
agreement
as
to
mitchell
epps
regarding
his
default.
perhaps
i
ought
to
explain
what
happened
in
the
epps
case
because
i
think
it
shows
in
other
instance
of
how
replevin
procedure
can
be
abuse
or
even
in
the
debtor-creditor
context.
mitchell
epps
had
two
separate
accounts.
he
had
a
revolving
account
on
which
she
bought
clothes
and
various
other
things
and
then
he
had
some
time
payment
accounts.
now,
what
happened
is
that
he
fell
behind
on
revolving
account
and
he
was
paid
up
to
date
with
the
time
payment
account.
so
governing
employees’
exchange
which
was
the
creditor
concern
at
his
particular
case
filed
a
writ
of
replevin
and
came
out
and
seized
all
the
things
that
he
bought
on
the
time
payment
accounts.
now,
there
is
some
question
as
to
whether
they
even
had
a
security
interest
in
those
goods
on
even
assuming
that
somewhere
they
could
produce
a
contract
which
showed
that
there
was
a
security
interest
and
goods
purchased
in
the
time
payment
accounts
for
violations
in
the
revolving
account
such
a
security
interest
would
probably
be
invalid
because
we
have
a
case
right
on
point
decided
in
the
district
columbia
circuit
which
indicates
that
such
a
security
interest
is
unconscionable.
that
is
the
case
of
williams
versus
walker
thomas
furniture
company.
so
i
think
that
this
shows
another
of
the
possible
of
abuses
to
which
the
pennsylvania
replevin
procedure
because
it
is
not
narrowly
drawn
in
subject.
that
is
that
the
creditor
can
define
what
the
security
interest
is
and
what
he
thinks
the
security
interest
extends
to
before
he
goes
out
and
replevins
the
goods.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
yes,
i
would
say
it
is.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
i
think
that
it
is.
i
think
that
it
represents
a
violation
of
due
process
of
the
citizens
of
pennsylvania,
for
checking
any
of
those
citizens
who
have
been
subject
to
the
seizure
of
the
property
without
any
notice
or
opportunity
to
be
heard.
now,
what
the
court
below
constantly
speaks
of
is
only
the
parham
fact
situation
and
the
court
talks
about
how
default
is
not
denied
here.
well,
there
is
no
question
that
the
parham’s
were
behind
in
the
payments
on
their
contract
but
they
were
making
some
payments.
in
fact,
they
had
made
a
$25.00
payment
in
august
of
1970
and
made
a
$20.00
payment
in
the
beginning
of
september
1970
and
then
a
week
later,
sears
roebuck,
except
$20.00
payment
came
out
and
replevied
the
goods.
and
by
this
time
they
had
paid
off,
i
believe
approximately
$200.00
of
the
$384.00
debt,
that
they
originally
had.
i
think
that
the
parham’s,
they
had
an
opportunity
to
get
in
the
court
and
raise
any
defenses
that
they
might
have
had.
they
might
have
been
able
to
establish
that
in
fact,
sears
roebuck
could
agree
to
accept
the
$20.00
payments
a
month
as
a
payout
schedule.
because
the
only
reason
that
mr.
parham
was
not
able
to
keep
up
his
original
schedule
was
because
he
lost
his
job.
so
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
also
that
the
replevin
procedure
is
subject
to
mr.
parham,
never
having
an
opportunity
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
no,
what
i
am
suggesting
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
that
is
not
what
i
meant
to
suggest
mr.
justice
marshall.
perhaps,
i
ought
to
explain
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
i
am
saying
that
it
may
have
this
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
it
may
have
represented
that
they
accepted
a
lesser
payment
schedule
from
the
parham’s
in
light
of
the
fact
that
they
were
not
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
i
think
if
the
man
accepted
the
$20.00
and
does
not
say
anything
about
it,
there
is
at
least
an
argument
that
can
be
made.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
not
that
he
does
not
notify
but
that
in
fact,
the
creditor
should
decease
from
taking
the
property
as
long
as
the
consumer
is
willing
to
work
out
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
i
do
no
think
that
it
could
possibly
be
asserted
if
they
did
not
know
the
balance.
i
did
not
mean
to
assert
that.
now,
in
addition
to
a
claim
that
the
due
process
rights
of
the
consumers
were
violated,
there
is
also
a
claim
made
by
the
consumers
in
this
court
and
it
was
also
made
below
that
the
fourth
amendment
rights
of
the
consumers
were
also
violated.
because
when
an
effect
is
permitted
here
is
an
entry
into
the
home
of
the
consumers
and
a
taking
of
their
goods
without
there
being
any
assertion
on
the
part
of
the
creditor
that
he
has
probable
cause
to
enter
the
home
and
to
seize
the
particular
goods.
now,
the
court
below
gets
out
of
any
discussion
of
the
fourth
amendment
in
a
very
easy
manner,
they
simply
say
that
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
apply
the
civil
cases
and
this
is
a
civil
case
therefore
no
fourth
amendment.
i
do
not
think
that
that
follows
the
teachings
of
this
court
as
to
what
the
nature
of
the
fourth
amendment
is.
the
nature
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
to
protect
person’s
right
to
privacy
to
their
home.
it
is
to
prevent
seizure
or
searches
of
the
home
and
entry
into
the
home
by
state
official
in
any
instance.
whether
the
official
is
executing
criminal
process
or
whether
as
in
this
case
is
executing
on
civil
process.
now,
i
think
that
the
several
cases
that
point
to
this
result.
first
of
all,
the
camara
case,
the
see
case.
even
this
court’s
decision
in
wiremen
versus
james,
although
in
that
case,
it
was
found
that
there
was
no
search
and
no
seizure,
that
case
reiterated
the
holding
of
the
camara
and
the
see
cases
that
in
fact
the
fourth
amendment
is
not
limited
to
cases
in
which
there
is
a
criminal
matter
that
is
before
the
court
and
i
think
other
cases
that
support
this
notion
of
the
griswold
case
which
the
fourth
amendment
is
one
of
the
grounds
given
for
that
decision
and
also
the
viven
case
in
which
it
was
permitted
at,
the
plaintiff
was
permitted
to
bring
an
action,
civil
action,
based
on
the
fourth
amendment.
positing
that
the
fourth
amendment
does
apply
the
civil
cases,
i
think
it
is
fairly
easy
to
see
that
in
this
case,
there
is
no
showing
of
probable
cause
before
a
magistrate
or
any
person
before
the
seizure
of
property
is
affected.
in
fact
in
pennsylvania,
there
is
no
procedure
that
ever
goes
before
any
neutral
arbitrator.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
i
do
not
--
neither
of
the
contracts
concerning
this
case
really
say
anything
about
replevin.
the
only
thing
that
the
contracts
and
now
this
is
putting
aside
the
washington
case
which
of
course
is
not
a
consumer
case
and
shows
out
the
fourth
amendment
invasion
on
mrs.
washington,
i
do
not
think
that
is
it
all
relevant
too,
but
even
assuming
that
mrs.
washington
is
out
of
the
case
for
a
minute,
then
we
have
just
the
consumers.
we
have
an
agreement
that
says
that
the
creditor
shall
retain
title
to
the
instruments
and
the
one
contract
says,
they
may
repossess
goods,
the
other
says,
they
may
retake
goods.
well,
title
in
itself
as
the
uniform
commercial
code
points
out
merely
means
that
the
creditor
has
a
security
interest
in
the
goods.
so
to
say
they
have
the
security
interest
then
title
is
probably
redundant.
now,
in
the
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
right!
that
does
--
a
point
from
the
contract
that
i
was
referring
to
you,
i
mean,
retake
the
merchandise
again.
it
does
not
say,
however,
that
they
may,
that
is
the
epps
contract,
if
i
am
not
mistaken.
that
indicates,
that
does
not
say
that
they
may
replevy
the
contract
of
the
property
and
perhaps
the
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
epps
contract
is
to
be
interpreted
the
same
way
as
the
sears,
roebuck
contract
which
merely
permits
repossession
by
the
creditor
and
repossession
is
not
replevin.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
they
could
attempt
to
come
there
by
self-help,
but
the
distinction
between
repossession
and
replevin
is
that
if
mrs.
washington
and
mrs.
parham
said
to
sears,
roebuck
or
to
mr.
washington,
you
cannot
enter
my
house,
or
i
am
not
going
to
let
you
come
into
repossess
the
goods,
the
repossession
would
have
to
stop
at
that
point
and
i
think
that
is
the
important
distinction
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
i
think
that
it
is.
i
think
that
is
ambiguous
retake.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
i
think
a
fair
interpretation
is
that
all
retake
means
is
repossession.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
that
is
the
definition
of
repossession.
repossession
has
to
be
a
feasible
taking.
so
the
minute
that
mr.
epps
and
mrs.
parham
would
attempt
to
stop
sears
from
retaking
the
goods,
they
would
have
to
stop
it.
all
repossessions
of
course
are
non-consensual
or
repossession
can
be
consensual.
the
parham’s
may
have
decided,
in
fact,
they
could
not
keep
up
the
payments
and
they
would
just
as
soon
have
sears
to
take
it
back.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
i
think
that
is
all
that
they
reached.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
i
would
not
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
i
would
not
interpret
that
contract
as
permitting
a
forcible
seizure
merely
because
the
meaning
of
repossession
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
i
would
agree
with
you,
your
honor,
but
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
by
definite
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
it
is
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
i
do
not
think
that
mr.
parham
can
be
held
to
any
interpretation
of
repossession,
other
than
what
it
means
in
the
law
or
nearly
which
is
a
feasible
taking
and
i
do
not
see
how
mr.
parham
especially,
mr.
parham,
of
course,
is
a
not
the
person
that
drafted
the
contract
could
possibly
be
held
to
such
an
interpretation
that
it
would
permit
replevin.
also,
with
respect
to
the
fourth
amendment
of
course,
the
agreement
is
merely
between
sears,
roebuck
and
mrs.
parham.
it
does
not
permit
the
sheriff
to
come
in
and
take
the
goods
and
that
is
the
person
who
takes
the
goods
in
this
case.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
thank
you,
your
honor.
