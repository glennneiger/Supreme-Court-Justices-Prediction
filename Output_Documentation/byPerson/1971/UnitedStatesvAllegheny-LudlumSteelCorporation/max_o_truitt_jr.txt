mr.
max
o.
truitt,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
present
the
argument
on
behalf
of
the
shippers
in
this
case
and
mr.
moloney
will
argue
on
behalf
of
the
railroads,
so
we
need
to
divide
our
time
evenly.
on
behalf
of
the
shippers,
let
me
say
that,
we're
willing
to
accept
the
finding
of
the
conclusion
that
there
is
a
freight
car
shortage.
i
don't
believe
it
is
fair
to
characterize
it
as
mr.
huntington
did,
as
a
chronic
national
shortage
and
i
don't
believe
the
record
will
support
that,
but
we
are
not
willing
to
accept
the
commission's
proposed
remedy
for
two
reasons.
the
first
is
that
when
you
take
car
service
rules
1
and
2
and
make
them
mandatory,
they
are
not,
we
contend,
reasonable
car
service
rules
as
required
under
section
1
(14)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
because
they
will
work
enormous
injury
both
to
shipper
and
carriers,
without
we
contend
any
offsetting
benefit
and
because
in
fact,
they
cannot
be
complied
with
and
because
the
exceptions
provisions
to
which
mr.
huntington
has
referred
are
wholly
inadequate.
secondly,
we
contend
that
the
imposition
of
these
rules
for
mandatory
observance
as
a
method
of
solving
the
freight
car
shortage
problem,
as
a
method
of
causing
an
increase
in
the
number
of
cars
that
exists
simply
is
not
rational.
the
thrust
of
car
service
rules
1
and
2
is
this.
when
a
railroad
unloads
a
car
that
it
does
not
own,
car
service
rules
1
and
2
oblige
it
to
return
that
car
to
its
owner.
the
purpose
of
returning
the
car
to
the
owner
is
as
the
commission
concedes,
to
make
the
car
available
to
its
owner
and
the
obligation
to
return
takes
precedence
over
the
needs
of
any
shippers
that
maybe
located
on
the
lines
where
the
car
was
unloaded
to
have
their
freight
moved.
now
it
was
an
obvious
correlative
of
returning
cars
to
owners,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
some
railroads
are
deprived
of
the
use
of
those
cars,
and
that
some
shippers
do
not
get
their
freight
moved
by
the
mere
accident
of
being
located
on
a
line
which
does
not
happen
to
have
a
car
of
proper
ownership,
in
which
its
freight
can
be
loaded.
at
the
present
time,
the
railroads
have
access
either
by
owning
cars
or
by
renting
them
to
a
national
carpool
and
access
to
this
pool
enables
car-poor
roads,
that
is
those
that
don't
own
enough
to
serve
their
shippers
by
using
the
cars
ship
along
to
other
roads.
this
has
been
worked
out
as
a
result,
really,
of
a
national
policy
in
favor
of
moving
freight
as
opposed
to
returning
cars
merely
to
their
owners.
for
example,
if
for
instance,
the
southern
pacific
loads
up
all
of
its
own
boxcars
and
sends
them
of
from
the
direction
of
the
east,
it
does
not
have
to
stop
sending
traffic
in
the
way
till
gets
its
cars
back.
it
can
send
the
cars
of
other
railroads,
can
load
them
and
send
them
wherever
the
freight
needs
to
go.
the
commission's
order
changes
all
of
that
and
as
i
say,
creates
an
absolute
claim
by
an
owner
on
the
use
of
this
car
and
it
gives
his
shippers
a
preferential
access
to
rail
transportation.
our
first
argument
is
that
the
commission's
order
cannot
be
sustained
as
an
order
which
prescribes
a
reasonable
car
service
rules,
of
course,
the
rules
are
not
reasonable
for
their
main
obligatory.
as
the
record
reflects,
the
absolute
compliance
with
the
rules
will
cause
enormous
injury
to
shippers.
the
injury
to
the
shippers
and
i
must
say,
that
the
steel
industry
was
only
one
of
several
which
opposed
these
rules
vigorously,
is
detailed
throughout
the
record.
the
gypsum
industry
opposed,
the
grocery
industry
opposed,
the
chemical
industry
opposed,
every
industry
which
brokers
its
products
in
transit
opposed,
because
obviously,
if
you're
located
on
the
west-coast
and
you
are
sending
a
car,
you
are
sending
a
load
east
and
you
are
going
to
sell
it
on
the
way,
and
you
don't
know
until
it
gets
midway
across
the
country,
whether
it's
going
to
end
up
in
portland,
maine
or
in
miami,
florida,
you
can't
very
well
load
that
car
in
compliance
with
the
rules.
the
steel
industry,
particularly
detailed
an
absolute
inability
to
forecast
the
needs
at
the
loading
docks
in
order
to
order
cars
of
appropriate
ownership,
even
if
the
roads
which
serve
the
plants
happen
to
have
proper
ownership
cars
on
hand.
the
hearing
examiner
found,
for
example,
that
at
the
youngstown
plant
at
campbell,
ohio,
the
obligation
to
comply
with
the
rules,
would
create
a
situation
which
couldn't
be
dealt
with,
the
steel
company
simply
did
not
have
the
room,
the
switching
facilities
to
load
cars
properly.
and
it
was
this
kind
of
evidence
and
that
kind
of
finding
which
the
commission,
i
think
rather
cavalierly
characterized
as
some
extra
switching
and
short
delays.
other
shippers
as
i
say,
also
opposed
the
observance
of
these
rules
on
a
mandatory
basis
vigorously.
the
commission,
indeed
acknowledged
or
the
hearing
examiner
acknowledged
that
the
shippers
presented
a
solid
opposition
to
the
rules.
now
against
that
solid
opposition
and
against
the
evidence
that
mandatory
observance
would
injure
shippers,
one
would
suppose
that
the
commission
would
have
found
that
there
would
be
some
offsetting
benefits
in
terms
of
car
service,
but
there
isn't.
the
best
the
commission
can
do
is
to
say
that
return
of
cars
to
the
owners
will
improve
utilization
by
making
them
available
to
the
owners
and
it
is
here,
i
think
that,
we
and
the
government,
so
fundamentally
disagree.
if
improving
--
if
making
cars
available
to
the
owners
is
really
going
to
improve
car
service,
well
then
it
must
be
because
there
is
freight
on
the
owner's
lines
to
be
shipped
or
there
is
more
freight
on
the
owner's
lines
to
be
shipped,
or
that
whatever
freight
that
is
there
is
in
greater
need
of
shipment
than
the
freight
which
is
located
where
the
car
was
unloaded.
but
there
is
no
such
evidence
anywhere
in
the
record
and
it
is
for
that
reason,
of
course,
that
there
is
no
finding.
moreover,
in
the
1947
proceeding,
to
which
mr.
huntington
referred,
it's
entitled
car
service
freight
cars
and
it
is
eluded
to
at
page
20
of
our
brief,
the
commission
found
that
in
times
of
car
shortage,
maximum
utilization
of
the
existing
freight
cars
fleet
required,
ignoring
car
service
rules
1
and
2,
and
instead
of
taking
an
unloaded
empty
and
sending
it
back
to
the
owner,
to
or
toward
the
owner,
if
there
wasn't
load
ready
to
go
with
it,
that
the
maximum
utilization
of
the
freight
car
fleet
was
achieved
by
taking
that
empty
and
sending
it
to
the
nearest
freight
in
moving
that.
in
this
proceeding,
the
commission
has
offered
absolutely
no
justification
whatsoever
for
departing
from
that
precedent.
accordingly,
we
urge
as
our
first
point,
that
the
rules
cannot
be
sustained
as
reasonable
car
service
rules.
our
second
--
mr.
max
o.
truitt,
jr.
i
believe
the
present
per
diem
in
car
service
agreement,
mr.
justice
stewart,
goes
back
to
about
1920.
the
rules
have
existed
in
this
form
for
about
that
long,
i
don't
mean
in
this
particular
form
of
words,
but
in
this
set
of
--
mr.
max
o.
truitt,
jr.
it
is
a
--
it's
a
--
it
isn't
a
set
of
instructions
really,
it's
a
statement
of
preference.
if
the
southern
pacific
railroad
has
a
load
freight
that
is
bound
for
maine
and
it
has
one
of
its
own
cars
and
it
has
a
car
of
northwestern
road
and
it
has
a
boston
and
maine
car,
it's
in
the
rule
state
of
preference
for
loading
the
b&m
and
sending
that
car
back
towards
to
its
own
road,
but
it's
never
been
--
it's
never
been
obligatory
and
it's
has
never
been
enforced
so
that
freight
is
left
un-shipped.
so
that
if
the
only
cars,
the
southern
railroad
has
are
the
boston
and
maine
cars
and
it
has
a
load
going
to
seattle,
washington,
and
it
doesn't
have
a
seattle,
washington
car,
then
it
can
use
the
b&m
car
and
send
the
freight
up
there.
under
the
commission's
proposal
of
course,
they
won't
be
able
to
do
that,
that
will
be
a
violation
of
car
service
--
mr.
max
o.
truitt,
jr.
well
the
rules,
although
they
may
read
on
their
face
as
flat
--
mr.
max
o.
truitt,
jr.
in
fact,
the
common
law
of
the
railroad
--
mr.
max
o.
truitt,
jr.
--
is
such
that
they
have
been
always
allowed
to
make
common
sense
transportation
officer
good
judgments
about
whether
violation
of
the
rules
is
going
to
move
the
freight
and
in
fact,
in
1967,
when
the
current
version
of
the
aar
rules
was
adopted,
it
was
a
good
faith,
a
standard
of
good
faith
diligence
was
written
into
the
rules
expressively.
so
that
it
is
never
been
an
absolute
prohibition
or
an
absolute
injunction
about
how
cars
--
mr.
max
o.
truitt,
jr.
yes
sir,
that
is
correct.
mr.
max
o.
truitt,
jr.
i
believe
there
is
some
evidence
of
that
in
the
record,
mr.
chief
justice,
yes.
mr.
max
o.
truitt,
jr.
i
believe
it
did
find
that.
the
question
though
is
whether
the
rules,
the
argument
to
which
i
am
about
to
come
is
whether
the
imposition
of
these
rules
for
mandatory
observance,
is
a
rational
way
of
expanding
the
size
of
the
freight
car
fleet
for
that
after
all
is
what
the
commission
is
really
about,
that's
what
it
was
really
trying
to
do.
the
theory
of
the
commission's
order
is
simply
to
make
the
poor
poorer.
you
take
the
railroads
don't
own
enough
cars
and
you
don't
let
them
rent
cars,
then
in
theory
they
will
have
to
go
out
and
buy
cars
and
that
is,
i
believe,
the
acknowledged
purpose
of
the
rules,
but
we
contend
that
that
there
are
simply
no
findings
to
support
such
a
proposal.
in
the
first
place,
there
are
no
findings
of
which
shippers
will
be
deprived
of
cars
or
of
which
or
what
type
volume
of
freight
will
be
delayed
or
transferred
to
competitive
modes
of
transportation,
nor
is
there
any
explanation
in
the
commission's
report
of
how
depriving
some
identified
shippers
of
their
access
to
railroads,
and
thus
depriving
those
railroads
of
the
revenues
they
could
earn,
if
they
could
use
the
cars
to
move
freight,
is
consistent
with
the
goals
of
the
national
transportation
policy
which
are
to
foster,
adequate,
economical
and
efficient
service.
although
the
commission
is
obliged
under
the
national
transportation
policy
to
administer
the
act
so
as
to
foster
economic
conditions,
sound
economic
conditions
among
carriers,
to
prevent
destructive,
competitive
practices
and
to
prohibit
unjust
discrimination.
there
are
no
findings
in
the
commission's
report
concerning
the
impact
of
its
order
on
aspect
of
competition.
the
hearing
examiner
noted
that
evidence
existed
in
the
record,
that
the
rules
would
have
an
effect
on
competition
and
indeed
he
chastised
some
of
the
commission
witnesses
for
failing
to
develop
what
precisely
the
impact
would
be.
but
the
commission's
report
here
is
absolutely
silent
and
it
gives
absolutely
no
consideration
to
what
effect
these
rules
will
have
on
shippers,
on
carriers,
rail
carriers
or
indeed,
on
one
class
of
carrier
as
opposed
to
another
class
of
carrier,
so
we
don't
have
any
idea
what
the
commission's
rule
will
really
do.
the
final
and
i
think
the
most
glaring
omission
is
the
failure
to
find
that
any
road
will
be
financially
able
to
purchase
cars
since
the
objective
of
the
commission's
proceeding
is
to
cause
railroads
to
increase
their
ownership
it
seems
only
reasonable
that
the
commission
should
determine
that
they
are
able
to
do
that
do
that.
it
didn't
and
the
reason
it
didn't,
i
suppose,
is
perfectly
clear.
as
we
mentioned
in
our
brief,
commissioner
stafford
of
the
commission,
when
he
was
testifying
on
one
of
the
bills
you
asked
about,
mr.
justice
stewart,
just
last
year,
testified
before
the
senate
commerce
committee
that
the
railroads
simply
didn't
have
the
economic
capability
of
solving
the
freight
car
shortage.
that
i
think
is
why
there
is
no
evidence
about
which
roads
could
buy,
that
is
why
there
is
no
finding
that
the
roads
deprived
would
in
fact
be
able
to
buy.
indeed,
when
you
consider
the
whole
statute,
you
will
discover
that
there
is
one
section
which
is
paragraph
21
of
section
1,
which
authorizes
the
commission
to
acquire
railroads,
to
acquire
facilities,
but
it
doesn't
permit
the
commission
to
do
that
unless
the
commission
finds
that
the
roads
which
will
be
ordered
to
acquire
facilities
can
in
fact
do
so
without
impairing
their
financial
ability
of
serving
the
public
and
discharging
their
common
carriage
obligations.
mr.
chief
justice,
one
word
in
response
to
the
question
you
asked
me
specifically;
the
evidence
to
which
the
commission
adverted,
box
cars
sitting
idle
was
in
its
discussion
of
assigned
cars.
those
are
cars
assigned
by
a
road
to
a
particular
shipper.
it
was
not,
in
respect
to
general
purpose
freight
cars,
which
is
the
classic
cars
and
to
which
this
order
applies.
accordingly,
we
urge
that
the
decision
of
the
district
court
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
mr.
max
o.
truitt,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
present
the
argument
on
behalf
of
the
shippers
in
this
case
and
mr.
moloney
will
argue
on
behalf
of
the
railroads,
so
we
need
to
divide
our
time
evenly.
on
behalf
of
the
shippers,
let
me
say
that,
we're
willing
to
accept
the
finding
of
the
conclusion
that
there
is
a
freight
car
shortage.
i
don't
believe
it
is
fair
to
characterize
it
as
mr.
huntington
did,
as
a
chronic
national
shortage
and
i
don't
believe
the
record
will
support
that,
but
we
are
not
willing
to
accept
the
commission's
proposed
remedy
for
two
reasons.
the
first
is
that
when
you
take
car
service
rules
1
and
2
and
make
them
mandatory,
they
are
not,
we
contend,
reasonable
car
service
rules
as
required
under
section
1
(14)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
because
they
will
work
enormous
injury
both
to
shipper
and
carriers,
without
we
contend
any
offsetting
benefit
and
because
in
fact,
they
cannot
be
complied
with
and
because
the
exceptions
provisions
to
which
mr.
huntington
has
referred
are
wholly
inadequate.
secondly,
we
contend
that
the
imposition
of
these
rules
for
mandatory
observance
as
a
method
of
solving
the
freight
car
shortage
problem,
as
a
method
of
causing
an
increase
in
the
number
of
cars
that
exists
simply
is
not
rational.
the
thrust
of
car
service
rules
1
and
2
is
this.
when
a
railroad
unloads
a
car
that
it
does
not
own,
car
service
rules
1
and
2
oblige
it
to
return
that
car
to
its
owner.
the
purpose
of
returning
the
car
to
the
owner
is
as
the
commission
concedes,
to
make
the
car
available
to
its
owner
and
the
obligation
to
return
takes
precedence
over
the
needs
of
any
shippers
that
maybe
located
on
the
lines
where
the
car
was
unloaded
to
have
their
freight
moved.
now
it
was
an
obvious
correlative
of
returning
cars
to
owners,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
some
railroads
are
deprived
of
the
use
of
those
cars,
and
that
some
shippers
do
not
get
their
freight
moved
by
the
mere
accident
of
being
located
on
a
line
which
does
not
happen
to
have
a
car
of
proper
ownership,
in
which
its
freight
can
be
loaded.
at
the
present
time,
the
railroads
have
access
either
by
owning
cars
or
by
renting
them
to
a
national
carpool
and
access
to
this
pool
enables
car-poor
roads,
that
is
those
that
don't
own
enough
to
serve
their
shippers
by
using
the
cars
ship
along
to
other
roads.
this
has
been
worked
out
as
a
result,
really,
of
a
national
policy
in
favor
of
moving
freight
as
opposed
to
returning
cars
merely
to
their
owners.
for
example,
if
for
instance,
the
southern
pacific
loads
up
all
of
its
own
boxcars
and
sends
them
of
from
the
direction
of
the
east,
it
does
not
have
to
stop
sending
traffic
in
the
way
till
gets
its
cars
back.
it
can
send
the
cars
of
other
railroads,
can
load
them
and
send
them
wherever
the
freight
needs
to
go.
the
commission's
order
changes
all
of
that
and
as
i
say,
creates
an
absolute
claim
by
an
owner
on
the
use
of
this
car
and
it
gives
his
shippers
a
preferential
access
to
rail
transportation.
our
first
argument
is
that
the
commission's
order
cannot
be
sustained
as
an
order
which
prescribes
a
reasonable
car
service
rules,
of
course,
the
rules
are
not
reasonable
for
their
main
obligatory.
as
the
record
reflects,
the
absolute
compliance
with
the
rules
will
cause
enormous
injury
to
shippers.
the
injury
to
the
shippers
and
i
must
say,
that
the
steel
industry
was
only
one
of
several
which
opposed
these
rules
vigorously,
is
detailed
throughout
the
record.
the
gypsum
industry
opposed,
the
grocery
industry
opposed,
the
chemical
industry
opposed,
every
industry
which
brokers
its
products
in
transit
opposed,
because
obviously,
if
you're
located
on
the
west-coast
and
you
are
sending
a
car,
you
are
sending
a
load
east
and
you
are
going
to
sell
it
on
the
way,
and
you
don't
know
until
it
gets
midway
across
the
country,
whether
it's
going
to
end
up
in
portland,
maine
or
in
miami,
florida,
you
can't
very
well
load
that
car
in
compliance
with
the
rules.
the
steel
industry,
particularly
detailed
an
absolute
inability
to
forecast
the
needs
at
the
loading
docks
in
order
to
order
cars
of
appropriate
ownership,
even
if
the
roads
which
serve
the
plants
happen
to
have
proper
ownership
cars
on
hand.
the
hearing
examiner
found,
for
example,
that
at
the
youngstown
plant
at
campbell,
ohio,
the
obligation
to
comply
with
the
rules,
would
create
a
situation
which
couldn't
be
dealt
with,
the
steel
company
simply
did
not
have
the
room,
the
switching
facilities
to
load
cars
properly.
and
it
was
this
kind
of
evidence
and
that
kind
of
finding
which
the
commission,
i
think
rather
cavalierly
characterized
as
some
extra
switching
and
short
delays.
other
shippers
as
i
say,
also
opposed
the
observance
of
these
rules
on
a
mandatory
basis
vigorously.
the
commission,
indeed
acknowledged
or
the
hearing
examiner
acknowledged
that
the
shippers
presented
a
solid
opposition
to
the
rules.
now
against
that
solid
opposition
and
against
the
evidence
that
mandatory
observance
would
injure
shippers,
one
would
suppose
that
the
commission
would
have
found
that
there
would
be
some
offsetting
benefits
in
terms
of
car
service,
but
there
isn't.
the
best
the
commission
can
do
is
to
say
that
return
of
cars
to
the
owners
will
improve
utilization
by
making
them
available
to
the
owners
and
it
is
here,
i
think
that,
we
and
the
government,
so
fundamentally
disagree.
if
improving
--
if
making
cars
available
to
the
owners
is
really
going
to
improve
car
service,
well
then
it
must
be
because
there
is
freight
on
the
owner's
lines
to
be
shipped
or
there
is
more
freight
on
the
owner's
lines
to
be
shipped,
or
that
whatever
freight
that
is
there
is
in
greater
need
of
shipment
than
the
freight
which
is
located
where
the
car
was
unloaded.
but
there
is
no
such
evidence
anywhere
in
the
record
and
it
is
for
that
reason,
of
course,
that
there
is
no
finding.
moreover,
in
the
1947
proceeding,
to
which
mr.
huntington
referred,
it's
entitled
car
service
freight
cars
and
it
is
eluded
to
at
page
20
of
our
brief,
the
commission
found
that
in
times
of
car
shortage,
maximum
utilization
of
the
existing
freight
cars
fleet
required,
ignoring
car
service
rules
1
and
2,
and
instead
of
taking
an
unloaded
empty
and
sending
it
back
to
the
owner,
to
or
toward
the
owner,
if
there
wasn't
load
ready
to
go
with
it,
that
the
maximum
utilization
of
the
freight
car
fleet
was
achieved
by
taking
that
empty
and
sending
it
to
the
nearest
freight
in
moving
that.
in
this
proceeding,
the
commission
has
offered
absolutely
no
justification
whatsoever
for
departing
from
that
precedent.
accordingly,
we
urge
as
our
first
point,
that
the
rules
cannot
be
sustained
as
reasonable
car
service
rules.
our
second
--
mr.
max
o.
truitt,
jr.
i
believe
the
present
per
diem
in
car
service
agreement,
mr.
justice
stewart,
goes
back
to
about
1920.
the
rules
have
existed
in
this
form
for
about
that
long,
i
don't
mean
in
this
particular
form
of
words,
but
in
this
set
of
--
mr.
max
o.
truitt,
jr.
it
is
a
--
it's
a
--
it
isn't
a
set
of
instructions
really,
it's
a
statement
of
preference.
if
the
southern
pacific
railroad
has
a
load
freight
that
is
bound
for
maine
and
it
has
one
of
its
own
cars
and
it
has
a
car
of
northwestern
road
and
it
has
a
boston
and
maine
car,
it's
in
the
rule
state
of
preference
for
loading
the
b&m
and
sending
that
car
back
towards
to
its
own
road,
but
it's
never
been
--
it's
never
been
obligatory
and
it's
has
never
been
enforced
so
that
freight
is
left
un-shipped.
so
that
if
the
only
cars,
the
southern
railroad
has
are
the
boston
and
maine
cars
and
it
has
a
load
going
to
seattle,
washington,
and
it
doesn't
have
a
seattle,
washington
car,
then
it
can
use
the
b&m
car
and
send
the
freight
up
there.
under
the
commission's
proposal
of
course,
they
won't
be
able
to
do
that,
that
will
be
a
violation
of
car
service
--
mr.
max
o.
truitt,
jr.
well
the
rules,
although
they
may
read
on
their
face
as
flat
--
mr.
max
o.
truitt,
jr.
in
fact,
the
common
law
of
the
railroad
--
mr.
max
o.
truitt,
jr.
--
is
such
that
they
have
been
always
allowed
to
make
common
sense
transportation
officer
good
judgments
about
whether
violation
of
the
rules
is
going
to
move
the
freight
and
in
fact,
in
1967,
when
the
current
version
of
the
aar
rules
was
adopted,
it
was
a
good
faith,
a
standard
of
good
faith
diligence
was
written
into
the
rules
expressively.
so
that
it
is
never
been
an
absolute
prohibition
or
an
absolute
injunction
about
how
cars
--
mr.
max
o.
truitt,
jr.
yes
sir,
that
is
correct.
mr.
max
o.
truitt,
jr.
i
believe
there
is
some
evidence
of
that
in
the
record,
mr.
chief
justice,
yes.
mr.
max
o.
truitt,
jr.
i
believe
it
did
find
that.
the
question
though
is
whether
the
rules,
the
argument
to
which
i
am
about
to
come
is
whether
the
imposition
of
these
rules
for
mandatory
observance,
is
a
rational
way
of
expanding
the
size
of
the
freight
car
fleet
for
that
after
all
is
what
the
commission
is
really
about,
that's
what
it
was
really
trying
to
do.
the
theory
of
the
commission's
order
is
simply
to
make
the
poor
poorer.
you
take
the
railroads
don't
own
enough
cars
and
you
don't
let
them
rent
cars,
then
in
theory
they
will
have
to
go
out
and
buy
cars
and
that
is,
i
believe,
the
acknowledged
purpose
of
the
rules,
but
we
contend
that
that
there
are
simply
no
findings
to
support
such
a
proposal.
in
the
first
place,
there
are
no
findings
of
which
shippers
will
be
deprived
of
cars
or
of
which
or
what
type
volume
of
freight
will
be
delayed
or
transferred
to
competitive
modes
of
transportation,
nor
is
there
any
explanation
in
the
commission's
report
of
how
depriving
some
identified
shippers
of
their
access
to
railroads,
and
thus
depriving
those
railroads
of
the
revenues
they
could
earn,
if
they
could
use
the
cars
to
move
freight,
is
consistent
with
the
goals
of
the
national
transportation
policy
which
are
to
foster,
adequate,
economical
and
efficient
service.
although
the
commission
is
obliged
under
the
national
transportation
policy
to
administer
the
act
so
as
to
foster
economic
conditions,
sound
economic
conditions
among
carriers,
to
prevent
destructive,
competitive
practices
and
to
prohibit
unjust
discrimination.
there
are
no
findings
in
the
commission's
report
concerning
the
impact
of
its
order
on
aspect
of
competition.
the
hearing
examiner
noted
that
evidence
existed
in
the
record,
that
the
rules
would
have
an
effect
on
competition
and
indeed
he
chastised
some
of
the
commission
witnesses
for
failing
to
develop
what
precisely
the
impact
would
be.
but
the
commission's
report
here
is
absolutely
silent
and
it
gives
absolutely
no
consideration
to
what
effect
these
rules
will
have
on
shippers,
on
carriers,
rail
carriers
or
indeed,
on
one
class
of
carrier
as
opposed
to
another
class
of
carrier,
so
we
don't
have
any
idea
what
the
commission's
rule
will
really
do.
the
final
and
i
think
the
most
glaring
omission
is
the
failure
to
find
that
any
road
will
be
financially
able
to
purchase
cars
since
the
objective
of
the
commission's
proceeding
is
to
cause
railroads
to
increase
their
ownership
it
seems
only
reasonable
that
the
commission
should
determine
that
they
are
able
to
do
that
do
that.
it
didn't
and
the
reason
it
didn't,
i
suppose,
is
perfectly
clear.
as
we
mentioned
in
our
brief,
commissioner
stafford
of
the
commission,
when
he
was
testifying
on
one
of
the
bills
you
asked
about,
mr.
justice
stewart,
just
last
year,
testified
before
the
senate
commerce
committee
that
the
railroads
simply
didn't
have
the
economic
capability
of
solving
the
freight
car
shortage.
that
i
think
is
why
there
is
no
evidence
about
which
roads
could
buy,
that
is
why
there
is
no
finding
that
the
roads
deprived
would
in
fact
be
able
to
buy.
indeed,
when
you
consider
the
whole
statute,
you
will
discover
that
there
is
one
section
which
is
paragraph
21
of
section
1,
which
authorizes
the
commission
to
acquire
railroads,
to
acquire
facilities,
but
it
doesn't
permit
the
commission
to
do
that
unless
the
commission
finds
that
the
roads
which
will
be
ordered
to
acquire
facilities
can
in
fact
do
so
without
impairing
their
financial
ability
of
serving
the
public
and
discharging
their
common
carriage
obligations.
mr.
chief
justice,
one
word
in
response
to
the
question
you
asked
me
specifically;
the
evidence
to
which
the
commission
adverted,
box
cars
sitting
idle
was
in
its
discussion
of
assigned
cars.
those
are
cars
assigned
by
a
road
to
a
particular
shipper.
it
was
not,
in
respect
to
general
purpose
freight
cars,
which
is
the
classic
cars
and
to
which
this
order
applies.
accordingly,
we
urge
that
the
decision
of
the
district
court
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
