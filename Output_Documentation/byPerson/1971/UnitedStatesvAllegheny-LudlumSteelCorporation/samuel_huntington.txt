mr.
samuel
huntington
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
direct
appeal
from
a
three-judge
district
court
sitting
in
the
western
district
of
pennsylvania.
the
question
presented
is
whether
the
district
court
erred
in
adjoining
the
enforcement
of
two
car
service
rules
adopted
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
govern
the
movement
of
freight
cars.
the
rules
were
promulgated
under
section
1
(14)
(a)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
which
authorizes
the
commission
to
establish
reasonable
rules
with
respect
to
car
service.
for
more
than
a
century,
railroads
have
freely
interchanged
freight
cars
so
that
freight
could
be
shipped
from
point
of
origin
to
point
of
destination
on
a
single
car.
to
govern
the
return
of
freight
cars
through
their
owners,
railroads
as
early
as
1902,
adopted
a
code
of
car
service
rules.
similar
rules
are
now
published
by
appellee,
the
american
association
of
railroads
for
aar
and
virtually
all
railroads
in
the
country
have
agreed
to
abide
by
that.
the
railroads
record
of
compliance
with
the
aar
car
service
rules
however
has
been
poor
particularly
during
times
of
general
freight
car
shortage.
the
commission
in
this
case
determined
that
a
number
of
the
aar
rules
should
be
enforced
and
thus
adapted
them
verbatim
as
commission
rules.
the
two
rules
here
under
attack,
rules
1
and
2,
generally
require
that
unloaded
freight
cars
be
returned
either
empty
or
loaded
in
the
direction
of
the
railroads
owning
the
cars.
freight
car
shortages
have
been
a
serious
and
recurring
problem
throughout
most
of
this
century.
in
the
1940s
for
example,
the
commission
concluded
after
a
general
investigation
that
railroads
as
a
group
had
failed
to
provide
adequate
freight
car
service.
the
commission
at
that
time
did
not
adopt
mandatory
rules
in
the
hopes
that
the
railroad
would
take
steps
to
solve
the
problem
themselves.
by
the
the
1960s
however,
it
became
apparent
that
the
problem
was
getting
worse.
clearly
voluntary
action
by
the
railroads
had
not
provided
the
solution.
to
meet
the
crisis,
the
commission
acted
on
a
number
of
related
fronts.
these
actions
included
adjusting
their
per
diem
charges
that
one
railroad
pays
for
the
use
of
another's
cars,
enforcing
the
requirement
that
boxcars
be
free
of
debris
when
unloaded
and
the
sponsoring
remedial
legislation.
the
commission's
attempt
to
add
an
incentive
element
in
the
per
diem
charges
is
a
subject
of
another
appeal
pending
before
this
court,
it's
the
florida
east
coast
railway
appeal,
no.
70-279.
the
instant
case
was
initiated
by
the
commission
to
investigate
all
aspects
of
freight
car
shortages
and
to
consider
the
prescription
of
mandatory
car
service
rules.
the
evidence
in
this
case
showed
that
the
total
number
of
freight
cars
owned
by
railroads
declined
from
1955
to
1964
by
more
than
12%.
while
the
individual
capacity,
the
average
capacity
of
individual
cars
increased
during
that
period,
the
aggregate
capacity
of
all
cars
also
declined
by
5%.
the
decline
was
shortest
more
than
22%
with
respect
to
plain
boxcars.
plain
boxcars
which
make
up
about
one-third
of
the
number
of
freight
cars
in
the
country
are
the
workhorse
of
the
car
fleet.
many
railroads
and
practically
all
the
shippers
participating
in
these
proceedings
acknowledge
the
existence
of
a
chronic
national
freight
car
shortage.
in
fact,
appellee,
that's
the
national
industrial
traffic
league
testified,
a
witness
testified
that
the
number
of
freight
cars
in
the
long
run
should
be
doubled
in
order
to
meet
the
needs
of
the
shippers.
to
combat
the
shortage
and
dislocation
of
freight
cars,
the
commission's
bureau
of
operations
proposed
that
certain
car
service
rules
be
made
mandatory.
appellees
have
attempted
to
paint
a
picture
of
virtual
uniform
opposition
to
the
imposition
of
mandatory
rules.
in
fact
however,
some
railroads
and
more
than
some
shippers
testified
that
enforceable
car
service
rules
were
needed.
the
strongest
opposition
to
mandatory
enforcement
of
car
service
rules
came
from
the
steel
industry.
witnesses
for
the
industry
testified
that
steel
companies
have
special
problems
with
respect
to
the
loading
of
freight
cars.
the
companies
introduced
studies
to
show
that
full
compliance
with
the
car
service
rules
1
and
2
would
be
impractical.
the
same
studies
however
which
are
cited
at
page
44
of
the
steel
appellees'
brief,
these
same
studies
indicated
that
a
vast
improvement
in
the
percentage
of
compliance
with
the
car
service
rules
was
possible,
albeit
at
some
cost
to
the
steel
companies.
on
completion
of
the
hearings,
the
examiner
filed
a
report
recommending
discontinuance
of
the
proceedings
on
the
grounds
that
no
shortage
of
freight
cars
existed
and
also
on
the
ground
that
prescription
of
the
car
service
rules
for
mandatory
observance
was
unwarranted.
mr.
samuel
huntington
no,
it
hasn't
no.
mr.
samuel
huntington
there
have
been
hearings
but
nothing
has,
no
final
action
has
been
taken
place.
in
rejecting
the
examiner's
conclusions
the
commission
fully
analyzed
the
data
on
shortages
and
found
that
there
is
in
fact
a
freight
car
shortage
and
the
commission
also
found
that
an
alarmingly
low
percentage
of
freight
cars
are
on
the
lines
of
their
owners
at
any
given
time.
the
commission
concluded
that
because
freight
car
owners
have
such
little
use
of
their
cars,
they
are
less
able
to
meet
the
particular
needs
of
their
shippers
and
they
have
little
incentive
to
spend
money
purchasing
new
cars
or
spend
money
to
maintain
their
existing
cars
to
high
standards.
the
commission
therefore
prescribed
aar
rules
1
and
2
among
others
for
mandatory
observance
stating
that
the
primary
objective
was
to
increase
the
availability
of
cars
to
their
owners.
in
that
way,
railroads
could
better
provide
for
their
shippers
and
those
railroads
with
deficient
car
supplies
would
be
identified
and
compelled
to
purchase
new
cars.
rules
1
and
2
as
adopted
by
the
commission,
had
a
built-in
exception
provision.
on
petitions
for
reconsideration,
the
commission
adopted
rule
19
which
established
an
additional
procedure
for
obtaining
exceptions.
to
determine
the
validity
of
the
commission's
action
here,
the
starting
point
is
of
course
the
statute
section
1
(14)
(a)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
we
have
traced
the
legislative
history
of
that
section
in
our
brief
and
i
will
not
go
into
that
here.
the
one
point
i
would
like
to
make,
i
would
like
to
meet
the
appellee's
contention
that
the
statute
was
designed
solely
to
deal
with
distribution
problems
of
freight
cars
as
opposed
to
problems
of
an
inadequate
number
of
freight
cars.
i
would
like
to
just
make
three
points
with
respect
to
that.
first,
a
look
at
the
original
esch
act
of
which
section
1
(14)
(a)
was
a
part,
shows
that
the
act
was
indeed
concerned
with
the
supply
of
freight
cars.
the
part
of
the
original
act
conferring
emergency
powers
on
the
commission,
conditioned
the
exercise
of
such
powers
on
a
determination
that
an
emergency
exists
in
respect
of
the
“supply
or
use”
of
cars.
when
later
an
additional
provision
which
is
now
section
1
(14)
(a)
was
added
to
confer
powers
upon
the
commission
in
non-emergency
situations,
the
congress
simply
did
not
put
in
that
prerequisite
requirement
for
a
finding
that
there
was
an
emergency,
so
the
supply
or
use
language
was
simply
left
out
of
that
provision.
second
point
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
the
house
report
on
the
esch
act
which
is
cited
at
page
21
of
our
brief,
clearly
reflects
a
concern
with
the
under
equipment
of
the
roads
or
the
lack
of
sufficient
cars.
finally,
any
doubt
as
to
the
coverage
of
the
original
esch
act
was
removed
in
1920.
the
original
act
had
defined
car
service
to
include
the
movement,
distribution,
exchange,
interchange
and
return
of
cars.
in
1920,
the
definition
was
amended
to
include
the
use,
control,
supply,
movement
etcetera
of
cars.
the
primary
thrust
of
appellee's
attack
on
the
commission's
adoption
of
rules
1
and
2
is
that
the
commission
failed
to
make
certain
findings
and
failed
to
get
proper
attention
to
the
adverse
effects
of
it's
order.
it
is
claimed
for
example
that
the
commission
should
have
made
a
finding
with
respect
to
the
shortages
on
high
ownership
lines.
i
think,
it
would
be
useful
here
to
define
what
i
mean
by
high
ownership
lines.
high
ownership
roads,
as
i
shall
use
the
term,
are
those
which
come
relatively
close
to
meeting
their
responsibilities
to
provide
a
fair
share
of
the
nation's
freight
cars.
it's
thus
defined
a
high
ownership
railroad
could
be
a
small
carrier
owning
in
absolute
terms
a
small
number
of
cars
provided
that
the
carrier
was
meeting
its
general
responsibility
to
provide
a
fair
share
of
the
nation's
supply
of
cars.
the
district
court
faltered
the
commission
for
failing
to
find
that
freight
car
shortages
were
more
acute
on
high
ownership
railroads
than
on
low
ownership
railroads.
appellees
appeared
was
--
assert
more
generally,
that
the
commission's
order
is
defective
since
the
commission
did
not
find
that
high
ownership
railroads
have
a
need
for
the
return
of
their
car.
in
our
view,
there
are
several
reasons
why
neither
of
these
findings
was
necessary.
first,
as
i
have
said,
the
purpose
of
the
commission's
order
was
to
increase
the
overall
supply
of
freight
cars.
clearly
some
railroads
would
have
to
purchase
additional
cars,
while
the
order
in
general
is
expected
to
provide
an
incentive
for
all
railroads
to
acquire
cars,
it
in
particular
puts
the
onus
on
the
low
ownership
lines,
where
it
rightly
should
be.
second,
even
if
there
were
no
shortages
on
high
ownership
lines,
enforcement
of
the
rules
would
not
necessarily
create
an
excess
or
surplus
of
cars
on
those
lines.
while
high
ownership
railroads
will
have
their
own
cars
returned
to
them
more
expeditiously,
they
in
turn,
of
course,
will
have
to
return
foreign
cars
on
their
systems
to
the
owning
roads.
finally,
in
the
event
that
a
surplus
should
develop
on
a
particular
railroad,
the
road
could
make
the
surplus
cars
available
to
other
railroads
who
had
a
need
for
those
cars.
this
could
be
down
under
the
exception
provision
provided
in
rules
1
and
2
and
moreover
the
commission
always
has
the
emergency
authority
under
section
115
of
the
act
to
order
the
cars
to
ship
--
to
order
any
surplus
car
shipped
to
an
area
where
they
are
needed.
appellees
also
assert
that
the
commission
should
have
made
a
finding
with
respect
to
the
financial
capacity
of
low
ownership
railroads
to
acquire
new
equipment,
but
the
commission's
order
does
not
direct
any
particular
railroad
to
purchase
equipment.
what
it
does
do
is
to
provide
an
incentive
for
railroads
to
purchase
equipment.
there
are
a
variety
of
methods
of
financing
new
equipment
many
of
which
do
not
require
substantial
initial
capital
outlays.
a
witness
for
the
southern
pacific,
for
example,
testified
that
that
company
had
acquired
a
leasing
corporation
and
was
prepared
to
lease
freight
cars
to
railroads
who
were
unable
to
purchase
them
outright.
and
a
special
provision
in
the
bankruptcy
act,
which
we
have
cited
at
page
30
of
our
brief,
makes
it
possible
for
railroads
undergoing
reorganization
to
purchase
new
equipment.
the
pan-central,
for
example,
has
been
able
to
acquire
new
equipment
while
it
has
been
in
reorganization
and
one
of
the
railroads
that
supported
the
adoption
of
mandatory
rules
here,
be
then
new
york,
new
haven
and
hartford
was
itself
in
reorganization
at
the
time
of
the
proceedings.
in
general,
the
argument
that
specific
findings
should
have
been
made
with
respect
to
shortages
in
financial
capacity
must
be
put
in
the
context
of
what
was
and
what
was
not
possible
in
these
proceedings.
the
commission
squarely
acknowledged
that
it
was
unable
to
make
findings
of
shortages
on
particular
carriers.
obviously
therefore,
it
could
not
make
findings
with
respect
to
the
financial
ability
of
low
ownership
roads
to
acquire
equipment.
yet
the
commission
could
find
and
did
find
that
the
railroads
as
a
whole
did
not
own
an
adequate
number
of
freight
cars.
to
say
that
in
spite
of
this
finding,
the
commission
was
powerless
to
act
until
every
aspect
of
the
shortage
was
fully
analyzed
and
categorized,
would
be
to
restrict
unduly
the
commission's
authority
under
section
1
(14)
(a)
to
meet
shortages
by
adopting
reasonable
car
service
rules.
finally,
appellees
(inaudible)
the
commission
for
failing
to
find
that
the
rules
would
in
fact
increase
the
supply
of
freight
cars,
but
no
one
can
predict
exactly
what
the
outcome
of
mandatory
enforcement
of
these
rules
will
be.
the
commission's
conclusion
that
it's
order
should
have
the
effect
of
increasing
supply,
we
submit
was
entirely
reasonable
and
fully
justified
by
its
reasoning
which
is
disclosed
by
its
opinion.
and
finally
the
commission
recognizing
that
in
the
light
of
experience
modification
to
the
rules
might
be
necessary,
specifically
held
the
proceeding
open,
so
that
as
experience
developed,
they
could
take
steps
to
modify
the
rules.
apart
from
the
alleged
absence
of
required
findings,
appellees
contend
the
enforcement
of
rules
wanted
to
impose
undue
hardship
on
shippers
and
railroads
and
like
and
will
completely
alter
the
traditional
methods
of
moving
traffic.
to
begin
with,
particularly
this
later
charge
brings
a
little
bit
hollow,
since
it
is
in
fact,
the
railroad's
own
rules
which
are
being
enforced
here.
but
more
to
the
point,
enforcement
of
the
rules
will
not,
as
is
suggested,
result
in
the
abolishment
of
a
national
pool
of
freight
cars.
the
rules
do
not
prohibit
the
loading
of
foreign
freight
cars.
they
simply
prescribe
the
circumstances
under
which
it
can
be
done.
railroads
both
large
and
small
will
continue
to
use
a
mixture
of
foreign
and
home
cars
to
meet
the
needs
of
their
shippers.
with
respect
to
the
undue
hardship
argument,
everyone
recognizes
that
100%
compliance
with
the
aar
rules
will
not
be
possible.
indeed
a
commission
witness
testified
that
it
was
impossible
to
write
any
set
of
car
service
rules
which
could
be
complied
with
a
100%
of
the
time.
the
exception
provisions
adopted
by
the
commission,
we
submit,
provide
the
necessary
relief
which
will
allow
these
rules
to
be
workable.
the
first
provision
is
contained
in
note
b
to
rules
1
and
2
and
that's
at
page
34
of
our
brief.
that
provision
permits
the
railroads
involved
to
negotiate
exceptions
to
the
rules
where
inequities
arise.
now
these
negotiations
will
be
subject
only
to
the
concurrence
of
the
car
service
division
of
the
aar,
prior
approval
of
the
commission
will
not
be
necessary.
it
is
expected
that
the
aar
would
keep
the
commission
informed
as
to
what
sort
of
exceptions
it
was
approving,
but
the
initial
responsibility
would
be
on
the
railroads
themselves
to
negotiate
exceptions
and
then
to
obtain
the
approval
of
the
aar.
there
is
no
requirement
that
request
to
the
aar
be
in
writing
and
none
is
sought
to
be
imposed
by
the
commission.
nor
will
a
separate
exception
be
required
with
respect
to
each
individual
freight
car
that
is
proposed
to
be
loaded
not
in
compliance
with
the
rules.
negotiated
exceptions
may
in
fact
involve
many
freight
cars
and
--
so
that
appellee's
assertion
that
there
will
be
a
flood
of
request
for
exceptions,
i
think,
they've
predicted
something
like
40,000
a
month,
we
submit
is
a
very
gross
exaggeration
indeed.
now
where
an
agreement
between
the
railroads
cannot
be
obtained
or
where
the
aar
car
service
rules
does
not
endorse
such
an
agreement,
then
rule
19
comes
in
to
play.
now
rule
19
which
was
adopted
by
the
commission
on
reconsideration
grants
very
broad
--
is
a
very
broad
grant
of
authority.
i
would
just
like
to
read
a
quote
from
that
rule.
under
that
rule,
the
bureau
of
operations
is
given
the
authority
to
grant
exceptions
“for
the
purpose
of
further
improving
car
supply
and
utilization,
increasing
availability
of
cars
to
their
owners,
improving
the
efficiency
of
railroad
operations
or
alleviating
inequities
or
hardships.
the
commission's
order
promulgating
rule
19
goes
even
further
and
specifically
authorizes
the
bureau
of
operations
to
modify
the
car
service
rules
for
the
purposes
specified
in
rule
19.
mr.
samuel
huntington
under
rule
19,
i
believe
the
--
you
would
have
to
most
like
--
well,
i
am
not
sure
this
has
been
worked
out.
i'd
imagine
that
for
broad
exceptions,
say
which
might
cover
the
operations
of
an
entire
plant,
the
submission
would
have
to
be
in
writing.
now
for
more
casual
exception
covering
only
a
matter
of
few
cars,
i
think
it
might
be
done
simply
by
telephone
and
not
(inaudible).
another
attack
made
by
appellee
is
that
the
commission
has
not
provided
the
courts
with
the
basis
for
determining
whether
it's
adoption
of
car
service
rules
1
and
2
is
consistent
with
the
national
transportation
policy
adopted
by
congress.
under
that
policy,
the
commission
must
administer
the
interstate
commerce
act
to
promote
an
adequate
economical
and
efficient
national
transportation
system,
but
clearly
the
commission's
action
here
comports
with
that
policy,
since
the
whole
purpose
of
the
adoption
of
the
rules
is
to
promote
adequate
freight
car
service
and
it
is
this
adequate
freight
car
service
which
the
railroads
have
thus
far
been
unable
to
provide
by
themselves.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
samuel
huntington
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
in
respect
to
mr.
justice
blackmun's
question
i
would
simply
like
to
point
out
that
the
new
york
new
haven
&
hartford
railroad
was
not
the
only
railroad
to
support
mandatory
enforcement
of
car
rules.
the
bno
and
cno
supported
the
rules,
that's
at
page
188-189
of
the
appendix.
the
great
northern
supported
the
rules
at
page
190
of
the
appendix,
and
the
pennsylvania
railroad
supported
the
rules
at
198
of
the
appendix.
these
are
not
small
railroads.
now
with
respect
to
the
argument
that
these
rules
will
not
increase
the
utilization
or
not
improve
the
utilization
of
cars,
i
would
simply
like
to
stress
again,
that
the
purpose
here
is
not
to
increase
the
utilization
of
primary
purpose,
but
to
increase
the
supply.
if
the
supply
continuous
to
diminish,
you
can
have
the
best
utilization
in
the
world,
but
still
be
faced
with
the
crisis.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well
i
think,
i
think
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well
the
--
what
--
i
think
if
we
look
at
in
terms
of
the
short
range
effect
and
the
long
range
effect,
clearly,
if
you
are
interested
only
in
the
short-term
then
you
will
want
to
load
whatever
cars
are
available
with
whatever
freight
to
go
anywhere.
but
if
you
are
interested
in
the
long-term
to
increase
the
supply
then
you
want
to
create
a
set
of
circumstances
which
will
encourage
the
roads
to
purchase
new
cars
and
that
is
what
the
commission
has
sought
to
do
here.
they
have
sought
to
provide
the
railroads
with
an
incentive,
they
have
sought
to
give
the
railroads
greater
use
of
their
cars.
so
that
they
will
then
have
some
incentive
to
go
out
and
purchase
cars.
they
have
also
sought
to
put
the
owners
on
the
particular
low
ownership
roads
that
should
be
purchasing
new
cars
so
that
they
can
know
that
they
are
deficient,
there
will
be
pressure
on
them
to
purchase
new
cars
and
they
can
justify
their
needs.
now
as
the
penn
central
for
example
which
is
in
reorganization
has
been
able
to
purchase
cars
because
there
is
pressure
on
that
railroad
and
they
can
go
before
the
bankruptcy
court
and
they
can
justify
the
need
and
this
is
essentially
what
the
commission
is
seeking
to
do
here,
to
put
railroads
in
a
position
where
they
will
have
to
meet
that
need
by
taking
whatever
steps
are
available
to
them.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well
the
evidence
came
from
first
from
submissions
to
the
commission
by
the
railroad
showing
that
over
a
ten-year
period
from
1955-1964,
the
total
number
of
freight
cars
in
the
nation
had
decreased
particularly
with
respect
to
plain
boxcars
and
the
total
aggregate
capacity
had
also
decreased.
mr.
samuel
huntington
the
demand
had
decreased,
but
at
a
much
lower
level.
the
demand
decreased
by
about
3%
whereas
total
capacity
had
decreased
about
5%.
with
respect
to
plain
boxcars
though
where
the
shortage
is
the
strongest,
the
total
capacity
had
declined
i
believe
around
12%.
in
addition
to
that
there
was
evidence
that
there
were
indeed
shortages
being
reported
by
shippers
and
these
were
compiled
in
various
reports
submitted
to
the
aar
and
introduced
into
evidence
in
this
record.
now
these
reports
did
come
under
heavy
attack
as
being
somewhat
exaggerated
and
the
commission
fully
dealt
with
that
in
its
opinion.
it
recognized
the
fact
that
shippers
sometimes
order
more
cars
then
they
need.
the
aar
had
in
its
treatment
of
these
figures
reduces
them
by
50%
and
that
perhaps
would
be
a
good
ballpark
method
of
dealing
to
these
statistics.
mr.
samuel
huntington
it
acted
--
it
initiated
this
investigation
on
its
own
motion.
the
fact
is
though
that
virtually
all
the
shippers
testifying
and
participating
in
this
proceeding,
testified
that
there
was
indeed
a
national
shortage.
one
other
question
i
would
like
to
address
to
myself
here
is
the
effect
that
this
order
will
have
on
competition
and
the
effect
that
it
will
have
on
low
ownership
railroads.
in
their
brief
and
here
in
argument
the
contentions
that
competition
among
railroads
will
suffer,
seems
to
be
based
on
two
assumptions.
one,
that
small
carriers
will
no
longer
have
access
to
a
national
freight
carpool,
and
two,
that
it
is
the
small
carriers
who
will
suffer
most
from
the
rules,
but
neither
of
these
assumptions
has
justified.
first
of
all,
as
i
stated
before
railroads
will
continue
to
load
foreign
cars.
they
will
use
a
mixture
of
foreign
and
home
cars.
there
is
no
absolute
rule
here
that
you
have
to
send
the
car
back
empty.
you
simply
have
to
find
the
car
of
the
right
ownership
and
then
you
can
load
it
and
send
it
back
in
that
direction.
second,
many
small
railroads
maybe
high
ownership
roads,
that
is
they
may
already
contribute
their
fair
share
of
cars
to
the
national
pool
and
finally,
even
the
assertion
that
the
financially
weak
railroads
will
be
affected
the
most,
is
somewhat
undercut
by
the
experience
in
penn
central
where
need
is
shown
the
necessary
step
that
can
be
taken.
in
conclusion,
i
would
like
to
say
that
the
commission
here
could
not
make
specific
findings
as
to
the
ownership
levels
on
particular
roads,
the
data
wasn't
available.
to
take
care
of
this,
the
commission
adopted
a
formula
in
this
very
proceeding
and
the
railroads
are
compiling
data
and
they
already
are
submitting
it
to
the
commission,
and
in
the
future
the
commission
will
have
much
better
data
on
which
to
act.
the
proceeding
is
open
for
that
very
reason.
as
the
data
comes
in,
the
commission
can
take
the
necessary
steps
to
modify
its
rules,
but
what
they
did
find
here
was
it
there
was
an
overall
shortage
and
that
something
had
to
be
done
not
five
years
from
now,
but
right
now
and
we
submit
that
under
these
circumstances
that
the
mandatory
adoption
of
these
rules
at
this
time
is
fully
appropriate.
thank
you.
mr.
samuel
huntington
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
direct
appeal
from
a
three-judge
district
court
sitting
in
the
western
district
of
pennsylvania.
the
question
presented
is
whether
the
district
court
erred
in
adjoining
the
enforcement
of
two
car
service
rules
adopted
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
govern
the
movement
of
freight
cars.
the
rules
were
promulgated
under
section
1
(14)
(a)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
which
authorizes
the
commission
to
establish
reasonable
rules
with
respect
to
car
service.
for
more
than
a
century,
railroads
have
freely
interchanged
freight
cars
so
that
freight
could
be
shipped
from
point
of
origin
to
point
of
destination
on
a
single
car.
to
govern
the
return
of
freight
cars
through
their
owners,
railroads
as
early
as
1902,
adopted
a
code
of
car
service
rules.
similar
rules
are
now
published
by
appellee,
the
american
association
of
railroads
for
aar
and
virtually
all
railroads
in
the
country
have
agreed
to
abide
by
that.
the
railroads
record
of
compliance
with
the
aar
car
service
rules
however
has
been
poor
particularly
during
times
of
general
freight
car
shortage.
the
commission
in
this
case
determined
that
a
number
of
the
aar
rules
should
be
enforced
and
thus
adapted
them
verbatim
as
commission
rules.
the
two
rules
here
under
attack,
rules
1
and
2,
generally
require
that
unloaded
freight
cars
be
returned
either
empty
or
loaded
in
the
direction
of
the
railroads
owning
the
cars.
freight
car
shortages
have
been
a
serious
and
recurring
problem
throughout
most
of
this
century.
in
the
1940s
for
example,
the
commission
concluded
after
a
general
investigation
that
railroads
as
a
group
had
failed
to
provide
adequate
freight
car
service.
the
commission
at
that
time
did
not
adopt
mandatory
rules
in
the
hopes
that
the
railroad
would
take
steps
to
solve
the
problem
themselves.
by
the
the
1960s
however,
it
became
apparent
that
the
problem
was
getting
worse.
clearly
voluntary
action
by
the
railroads
had
not
provided
the
solution.
to
meet
the
crisis,
the
commission
acted
on
a
number
of
related
fronts.
these
actions
included
adjusting
their
per
diem
charges
that
one
railroad
pays
for
the
use
of
another's
cars,
enforcing
the
requirement
that
boxcars
be
free
of
debris
when
unloaded
and
the
sponsoring
remedial
legislation.
the
commission's
attempt
to
add
an
incentive
element
in
the
per
diem
charges
is
a
subject
of
another
appeal
pending
before
this
court,
it's
the
florida
east
coast
railway
appeal,
no.
70-279.
the
instant
case
was
initiated
by
the
commission
to
investigate
all
aspects
of
freight
car
shortages
and
to
consider
the
prescription
of
mandatory
car
service
rules.
the
evidence
in
this
case
showed
that
the
total
number
of
freight
cars
owned
by
railroads
declined
from
1955
to
1964
by
more
than
12%.
while
the
individual
capacity,
the
average
capacity
of
individual
cars
increased
during
that
period,
the
aggregate
capacity
of
all
cars
also
declined
by
5%.
the
decline
was
shortest
more
than
22%
with
respect
to
plain
boxcars.
plain
boxcars
which
make
up
about
one-third
of
the
number
of
freight
cars
in
the
country
are
the
workhorse
of
the
car
fleet.
many
railroads
and
practically
all
the
shippers
participating
in
these
proceedings
acknowledge
the
existence
of
a
chronic
national
freight
car
shortage.
in
fact,
appellee,
that's
the
national
industrial
traffic
league
testified,
a
witness
testified
that
the
number
of
freight
cars
in
the
long
run
should
be
doubled
in
order
to
meet
the
needs
of
the
shippers.
to
combat
the
shortage
and
dislocation
of
freight
cars,
the
commission's
bureau
of
operations
proposed
that
certain
car
service
rules
be
made
mandatory.
appellees
have
attempted
to
paint
a
picture
of
virtual
uniform
opposition
to
the
imposition
of
mandatory
rules.
in
fact
however,
some
railroads
and
more
than
some
shippers
testified
that
enforceable
car
service
rules
were
needed.
the
strongest
opposition
to
mandatory
enforcement
of
car
service
rules
came
from
the
steel
industry.
witnesses
for
the
industry
testified
that
steel
companies
have
special
problems
with
respect
to
the
loading
of
freight
cars.
the
companies
introduced
studies
to
show
that
full
compliance
with
the
car
service
rules
1
and
2
would
be
impractical.
the
same
studies
however
which
are
cited
at
page
44
of
the
steel
appellees'
brief,
these
same
studies
indicated
that
a
vast
improvement
in
the
percentage
of
compliance
with
the
car
service
rules
was
possible,
albeit
at
some
cost
to
the
steel
companies.
on
completion
of
the
hearings,
the
examiner
filed
a
report
recommending
discontinuance
of
the
proceedings
on
the
grounds
that
no
shortage
of
freight
cars
existed
and
also
on
the
ground
that
prescription
of
the
car
service
rules
for
mandatory
observance
was
unwarranted.
mr.
samuel
huntington
no,
it
hasn't
no.
mr.
samuel
huntington
there
have
been
hearings
but
nothing
has,
no
final
action
has
been
taken
place.
in
rejecting
the
examiner's
conclusions
the
commission
fully
analyzed
the
data
on
shortages
and
found
that
there
is
in
fact
a
freight
car
shortage
and
the
commission
also
found
that
an
alarmingly
low
percentage
of
freight
cars
are
on
the
lines
of
their
owners
at
any
given
time.
the
commission
concluded
that
because
freight
car
owners
have
such
little
use
of
their
cars,
they
are
less
able
to
meet
the
particular
needs
of
their
shippers
and
they
have
little
incentive
to
spend
money
purchasing
new
cars
or
spend
money
to
maintain
their
existing
cars
to
high
standards.
the
commission
therefore
prescribed
aar
rules
1
and
2
among
others
for
mandatory
observance
stating
that
the
primary
objective
was
to
increase
the
availability
of
cars
to
their
owners.
in
that
way,
railroads
could
better
provide
for
their
shippers
and
those
railroads
with
deficient
car
supplies
would
be
identified
and
compelled
to
purchase
new
cars.
rules
1
and
2
as
adopted
by
the
commission,
had
a
built-in
exception
provision.
on
petitions
for
reconsideration,
the
commission
adopted
rule
19
which
established
an
additional
procedure
for
obtaining
exceptions.
to
determine
the
validity
of
the
commission's
action
here,
the
starting
point
is
of
course
the
statute
section
1
(14)
(a)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
we
have
traced
the
legislative
history
of
that
section
in
our
brief
and
i
will
not
go
into
that
here.
the
one
point
i
would
like
to
make,
i
would
like
to
meet
the
appellee's
contention
that
the
statute
was
designed
solely
to
deal
with
distribution
problems
of
freight
cars
as
opposed
to
problems
of
an
inadequate
number
of
freight
cars.
i
would
like
to
just
make
three
points
with
respect
to
that.
first,
a
look
at
the
original
esch
act
of
which
section
1
(14)
(a)
was
a
part,
shows
that
the
act
was
indeed
concerned
with
the
supply
of
freight
cars.
the
part
of
the
original
act
conferring
emergency
powers
on
the
commission,
conditioned
the
exercise
of
such
powers
on
a
determination
that
an
emergency
exists
in
respect
of
the
“supply
or
use”
of
cars.
when
later
an
additional
provision
which
is
now
section
1
(14)
(a)
was
added
to
confer
powers
upon
the
commission
in
non-emergency
situations,
the
congress
simply
did
not
put
in
that
prerequisite
requirement
for
a
finding
that
there
was
an
emergency,
so
the
supply
or
use
language
was
simply
left
out
of
that
provision.
second
point
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
the
house
report
on
the
esch
act
which
is
cited
at
page
21
of
our
brief,
clearly
reflects
a
concern
with
the
under
equipment
of
the
roads
or
the
lack
of
sufficient
cars.
finally,
any
doubt
as
to
the
coverage
of
the
original
esch
act
was
removed
in
1920.
the
original
act
had
defined
car
service
to
include
the
movement,
distribution,
exchange,
interchange
and
return
of
cars.
in
1920,
the
definition
was
amended
to
include
the
use,
control,
supply,
movement
etcetera
of
cars.
the
primary
thrust
of
appellee's
attack
on
the
commission's
adoption
of
rules
1
and
2
is
that
the
commission
failed
to
make
certain
findings
and
failed
to
get
proper
attention
to
the
adverse
effects
of
it's
order.
it
is
claimed
for
example
that
the
commission
should
have
made
a
finding
with
respect
to
the
shortages
on
high
ownership
lines.
i
think,
it
would
be
useful
here
to
define
what
i
mean
by
high
ownership
lines.
high
ownership
roads,
as
i
shall
use
the
term,
are
those
which
come
relatively
close
to
meeting
their
responsibilities
to
provide
a
fair
share
of
the
nation's
freight
cars.
it's
thus
defined
a
high
ownership
railroad
could
be
a
small
carrier
owning
in
absolute
terms
a
small
number
of
cars
provided
that
the
carrier
was
meeting
its
general
responsibility
to
provide
a
fair
share
of
the
nation's
supply
of
cars.
the
district
court
faltered
the
commission
for
failing
to
find
that
freight
car
shortages
were
more
acute
on
high
ownership
railroads
than
on
low
ownership
railroads.
appellees
appeared
was
--
assert
more
generally,
that
the
commission's
order
is
defective
since
the
commission
did
not
find
that
high
ownership
railroads
have
a
need
for
the
return
of
their
car.
in
our
view,
there
are
several
reasons
why
neither
of
these
findings
was
necessary.
first,
as
i
have
said,
the
purpose
of
the
commission's
order
was
to
increase
the
overall
supply
of
freight
cars.
clearly
some
railroads
would
have
to
purchase
additional
cars,
while
the
order
in
general
is
expected
to
provide
an
incentive
for
all
railroads
to
acquire
cars,
it
in
particular
puts
the
onus
on
the
low
ownership
lines,
where
it
rightly
should
be.
second,
even
if
there
were
no
shortages
on
high
ownership
lines,
enforcement
of
the
rules
would
not
necessarily
create
an
excess
or
surplus
of
cars
on
those
lines.
while
high
ownership
railroads
will
have
their
own
cars
returned
to
them
more
expeditiously,
they
in
turn,
of
course,
will
have
to
return
foreign
cars
on
their
systems
to
the
owning
roads.
finally,
in
the
event
that
a
surplus
should
develop
on
a
particular
railroad,
the
road
could
make
the
surplus
cars
available
to
other
railroads
who
had
a
need
for
those
cars.
this
could
be
down
under
the
exception
provision
provided
in
rules
1
and
2
and
moreover
the
commission
always
has
the
emergency
authority
under
section
115
of
the
act
to
order
the
cars
to
ship
--
to
order
any
surplus
car
shipped
to
an
area
where
they
are
needed.
appellees
also
assert
that
the
commission
should
have
made
a
finding
with
respect
to
the
financial
capacity
of
low
ownership
railroads
to
acquire
new
equipment,
but
the
commission's
order
does
not
direct
any
particular
railroad
to
purchase
equipment.
what
it
does
do
is
to
provide
an
incentive
for
railroads
to
purchase
equipment.
there
are
a
variety
of
methods
of
financing
new
equipment
many
of
which
do
not
require
substantial
initial
capital
outlays.
a
witness
for
the
southern
pacific,
for
example,
testified
that
that
company
had
acquired
a
leasing
corporation
and
was
prepared
to
lease
freight
cars
to
railroads
who
were
unable
to
purchase
them
outright.
and
a
special
provision
in
the
bankruptcy
act,
which
we
have
cited
at
page
30
of
our
brief,
makes
it
possible
for
railroads
undergoing
reorganization
to
purchase
new
equipment.
the
pan-central,
for
example,
has
been
able
to
acquire
new
equipment
while
it
has
been
in
reorganization
and
one
of
the
railroads
that
supported
the
adoption
of
mandatory
rules
here,
be
then
new
york,
new
haven
and
hartford
was
itself
in
reorganization
at
the
time
of
the
proceedings.
in
general,
the
argument
that
specific
findings
should
have
been
made
with
respect
to
shortages
in
financial
capacity
must
be
put
in
the
context
of
what
was
and
what
was
not
possible
in
these
proceedings.
the
commission
squarely
acknowledged
that
it
was
unable
to
make
findings
of
shortages
on
particular
carriers.
obviously
therefore,
it
could
not
make
findings
with
respect
to
the
financial
ability
of
low
ownership
roads
to
acquire
equipment.
yet
the
commission
could
find
and
did
find
that
the
railroads
as
a
whole
did
not
own
an
adequate
number
of
freight
cars.
to
say
that
in
spite
of
this
finding,
the
commission
was
powerless
to
act
until
every
aspect
of
the
shortage
was
fully
analyzed
and
categorized,
would
be
to
restrict
unduly
the
commission's
authority
under
section
1
(14)
(a)
to
meet
shortages
by
adopting
reasonable
car
service
rules.
finally,
appellees
(inaudible)
the
commission
for
failing
to
find
that
the
rules
would
in
fact
increase
the
supply
of
freight
cars,
but
no
one
can
predict
exactly
what
the
outcome
of
mandatory
enforcement
of
these
rules
will
be.
the
commission's
conclusion
that
it's
order
should
have
the
effect
of
increasing
supply,
we
submit
was
entirely
reasonable
and
fully
justified
by
its
reasoning
which
is
disclosed
by
its
opinion.
and
finally
the
commission
recognizing
that
in
the
light
of
experience
modification
to
the
rules
might
be
necessary,
specifically
held
the
proceeding
open,
so
that
as
experience
developed,
they
could
take
steps
to
modify
the
rules.
apart
from
the
alleged
absence
of
required
findings,
appellees
contend
the
enforcement
of
rules
wanted
to
impose
undue
hardship
on
shippers
and
railroads
and
like
and
will
completely
alter
the
traditional
methods
of
moving
traffic.
to
begin
with,
particularly
this
later
charge
brings
a
little
bit
hollow,
since
it
is
in
fact,
the
railroad's
own
rules
which
are
being
enforced
here.
but
more
to
the
point,
enforcement
of
the
rules
will
not,
as
is
suggested,
result
in
the
abolishment
of
a
national
pool
of
freight
cars.
the
rules
do
not
prohibit
the
loading
of
foreign
freight
cars.
they
simply
prescribe
the
circumstances
under
which
it
can
be
done.
railroads
both
large
and
small
will
continue
to
use
a
mixture
of
foreign
and
home
cars
to
meet
the
needs
of
their
shippers.
with
respect
to
the
undue
hardship
argument,
everyone
recognizes
that
100%
compliance
with
the
aar
rules
will
not
be
possible.
indeed
a
commission
witness
testified
that
it
was
impossible
to
write
any
set
of
car
service
rules
which
could
be
complied
with
a
100%
of
the
time.
the
exception
provisions
adopted
by
the
commission,
we
submit,
provide
the
necessary
relief
which
will
allow
these
rules
to
be
workable.
the
first
provision
is
contained
in
note
b
to
rules
1
and
2
and
that's
at
page
34
of
our
brief.
that
provision
permits
the
railroads
involved
to
negotiate
exceptions
to
the
rules
where
inequities
arise.
now
these
negotiations
will
be
subject
only
to
the
concurrence
of
the
car
service
division
of
the
aar,
prior
approval
of
the
commission
will
not
be
necessary.
it
is
expected
that
the
aar
would
keep
the
commission
informed
as
to
what
sort
of
exceptions
it
was
approving,
but
the
initial
responsibility
would
be
on
the
railroads
themselves
to
negotiate
exceptions
and
then
to
obtain
the
approval
of
the
aar.
there
is
no
requirement
that
request
to
the
aar
be
in
writing
and
none
is
sought
to
be
imposed
by
the
commission.
nor
will
a
separate
exception
be
required
with
respect
to
each
individual
freight
car
that
is
proposed
to
be
loaded
not
in
compliance
with
the
rules.
negotiated
exceptions
may
in
fact
involve
many
freight
cars
and
--
so
that
appellee's
assertion
that
there
will
be
a
flood
of
request
for
exceptions,
i
think,
they've
predicted
something
like
40,000
a
month,
we
submit
is
a
very
gross
exaggeration
indeed.
now
where
an
agreement
between
the
railroads
cannot
be
obtained
or
where
the
aar
car
service
rules
does
not
endorse
such
an
agreement,
then
rule
19
comes
in
to
play.
now
rule
19
which
was
adopted
by
the
commission
on
reconsideration
grants
very
broad
--
is
a
very
broad
grant
of
authority.
i
would
just
like
to
read
a
quote
from
that
rule.
under
that
rule,
the
bureau
of
operations
is
given
the
authority
to
grant
exceptions
“for
the
purpose
of
further
improving
car
supply
and
utilization,
increasing
availability
of
cars
to
their
owners,
improving
the
efficiency
of
railroad
operations
or
alleviating
inequities
or
hardships.
the
commission's
order
promulgating
rule
19
goes
even
further
and
specifically
authorizes
the
bureau
of
operations
to
modify
the
car
service
rules
for
the
purposes
specified
in
rule
19.
mr.
samuel
huntington
under
rule
19,
i
believe
the
--
you
would
have
to
most
like
--
well,
i
am
not
sure
this
has
been
worked
out.
i'd
imagine
that
for
broad
exceptions,
say
which
might
cover
the
operations
of
an
entire
plant,
the
submission
would
have
to
be
in
writing.
now
for
more
casual
exception
covering
only
a
matter
of
few
cars,
i
think
it
might
be
done
simply
by
telephone
and
not
(inaudible).
another
attack
made
by
appellee
is
that
the
commission
has
not
provided
the
courts
with
the
basis
for
determining
whether
it's
adoption
of
car
service
rules
1
and
2
is
consistent
with
the
national
transportation
policy
adopted
by
congress.
under
that
policy,
the
commission
must
administer
the
interstate
commerce
act
to
promote
an
adequate
economical
and
efficient
national
transportation
system,
but
clearly
the
commission's
action
here
comports
with
that
policy,
since
the
whole
purpose
of
the
adoption
of
the
rules
is
to
promote
adequate
freight
car
service
and
it
is
this
adequate
freight
car
service
which
the
railroads
have
thus
far
been
unable
to
provide
by
themselves.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
samuel
huntington
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
in
respect
to
mr.
justice
blackmun's
question
i
would
simply
like
to
point
out
that
the
new
york
new
haven
&
hartford
railroad
was
not
the
only
railroad
to
support
mandatory
enforcement
of
car
rules.
the
bno
and
cno
supported
the
rules,
that's
at
page
188-189
of
the
appendix.
the
great
northern
supported
the
rules
at
page
190
of
the
appendix,
and
the
pennsylvania
railroad
supported
the
rules
at
198
of
the
appendix.
these
are
not
small
railroads.
now
with
respect
to
the
argument
that
these
rules
will
not
increase
the
utilization
or
not
improve
the
utilization
of
cars,
i
would
simply
like
to
stress
again,
that
the
purpose
here
is
not
to
increase
the
utilization
of
primary
purpose,
but
to
increase
the
supply.
if
the
supply
continuous
to
diminish,
you
can
have
the
best
utilization
in
the
world,
but
still
be
faced
with
the
crisis.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well
i
think,
i
think
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well
the
--
what
--
i
think
if
we
look
at
in
terms
of
the
short
range
effect
and
the
long
range
effect,
clearly,
if
you
are
interested
only
in
the
short-term
then
you
will
want
to
load
whatever
cars
are
available
with
whatever
freight
to
go
anywhere.
but
if
you
are
interested
in
the
long-term
to
increase
the
supply
then
you
want
to
create
a
set
of
circumstances
which
will
encourage
the
roads
to
purchase
new
cars
and
that
is
what
the
commission
has
sought
to
do
here.
they
have
sought
to
provide
the
railroads
with
an
incentive,
they
have
sought
to
give
the
railroads
greater
use
of
their
cars.
so
that
they
will
then
have
some
incentive
to
go
out
and
purchase
cars.
they
have
also
sought
to
put
the
owners
on
the
particular
low
ownership
roads
that
should
be
purchasing
new
cars
so
that
they
can
know
that
they
are
deficient,
there
will
be
pressure
on
them
to
purchase
new
cars
and
they
can
justify
their
needs.
now
as
the
penn
central
for
example
which
is
in
reorganization
has
been
able
to
purchase
cars
because
there
is
pressure
on
that
railroad
and
they
can
go
before
the
bankruptcy
court
and
they
can
justify
the
need
and
this
is
essentially
what
the
commission
is
seeking
to
do
here,
to
put
railroads
in
a
position
where
they
will
have
to
meet
that
need
by
taking
whatever
steps
are
available
to
them.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well
the
evidence
came
from
first
from
submissions
to
the
commission
by
the
railroad
showing
that
over
a
ten-year
period
from
1955-1964,
the
total
number
of
freight
cars
in
the
nation
had
decreased
particularly
with
respect
to
plain
boxcars
and
the
total
aggregate
capacity
had
also
decreased.
mr.
samuel
huntington
the
demand
had
decreased,
but
at
a
much
lower
level.
the
demand
decreased
by
about
3%
whereas
total
capacity
had
decreased
about
5%.
with
respect
to
plain
boxcars
though
where
the
shortage
is
the
strongest,
the
total
capacity
had
declined
i
believe
around
12%.
in
addition
to
that
there
was
evidence
that
there
were
indeed
shortages
being
reported
by
shippers
and
these
were
compiled
in
various
reports
submitted
to
the
aar
and
introduced
into
evidence
in
this
record.
now
these
reports
did
come
under
heavy
attack
as
being
somewhat
exaggerated
and
the
commission
fully
dealt
with
that
in
its
opinion.
it
recognized
the
fact
that
shippers
sometimes
order
more
cars
then
they
need.
the
aar
had
in
its
treatment
of
these
figures
reduces
them
by
50%
and
that
perhaps
would
be
a
good
ballpark
method
of
dealing
to
these
statistics.
mr.
samuel
huntington
it
acted
--
it
initiated
this
investigation
on
its
own
motion.
the
fact
is
though
that
virtually
all
the
shippers
testifying
and
participating
in
this
proceeding,
testified
that
there
was
indeed
a
national
shortage.
one
other
question
i
would
like
to
address
to
myself
here
is
the
effect
that
this
order
will
have
on
competition
and
the
effect
that
it
will
have
on
low
ownership
railroads.
in
their
brief
and
here
in
argument
the
contentions
that
competition
among
railroads
will
suffer,
seems
to
be
based
on
two
assumptions.
one,
that
small
carriers
will
no
longer
have
access
to
a
national
freight
carpool,
and
two,
that
it
is
the
small
carriers
who
will
suffer
most
from
the
rules,
but
neither
of
these
assumptions
has
justified.
first
of
all,
as
i
stated
before
railroads
will
continue
to
load
foreign
cars.
they
will
use
a
mixture
of
foreign
and
home
cars.
there
is
no
absolute
rule
here
that
you
have
to
send
the
car
back
empty.
you
simply
have
to
find
the
car
of
the
right
ownership
and
then
you
can
load
it
and
send
it
back
in
that
direction.
second,
many
small
railroads
maybe
high
ownership
roads,
that
is
they
may
already
contribute
their
fair
share
of
cars
to
the
national
pool
and
finally,
even
the
assertion
that
the
financially
weak
railroads
will
be
affected
the
most,
is
somewhat
undercut
by
the
experience
in
penn
central
where
need
is
shown
the
necessary
step
that
can
be
taken.
in
conclusion,
i
would
like
to
say
that
the
commission
here
could
not
make
specific
findings
as
to
the
ownership
levels
on
particular
roads,
the
data
wasn't
available.
to
take
care
of
this,
the
commission
adopted
a
formula
in
this
very
proceeding
and
the
railroads
are
compiling
data
and
they
already
are
submitting
it
to
the
commission,
and
in
the
future
the
commission
will
have
much
better
data
on
which
to
act.
the
proceeding
is
open
for
that
very
reason.
as
the
data
comes
in,
the
commission
can
take
the
necessary
steps
to
modify
its
rules,
but
what
they
did
find
here
was
it
there
was
an
overall
shortage
and
that
something
had
to
be
done
not
five
years
from
now,
but
right
now
and
we
submit
that
under
these
circumstances
that
the
mandatory
adoption
of
these
rules
at
this
time
is
fully
appropriate.
thank
you.
