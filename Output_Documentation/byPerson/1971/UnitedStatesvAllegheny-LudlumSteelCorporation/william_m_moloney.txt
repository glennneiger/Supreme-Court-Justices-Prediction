mr.
william
m.
moloney
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
here
representing
the
association
of
american
railroads
and
it's
member
lines.
it
is
my
purpose
and
it's
my
hope
that
i
will
be
able
to
highlight
some
of
what
we
consider
to
be
the
unusual
aspects
of
this
case
or
at
least
aspects
that
we
consider
to
be
out
of
the
ordinary.
now
the
rhetoric
used
in
this
case
might
be
the
inevitable
result
of
the
case,
and
you
heard
a
part
of
that
from
government
counsel
a
moment
ago
when
he
referred
to
owner
railroads
or
a
railroad
that
owns
almost
as
many
cars
as
it
should
own,
but
there
is
nothing
in
his
evidence
to
identify
that
railroad
or
any
other
railroad,
or
how
many
cars
that
railroad
should
own,
or
whether
it
owns
a
relatively
higher
percentage
of
cars
or
it's
relatively
low
percentage
of
cars.
now
this
is
the
rhetoric
mismatch
that
this
case
really
finds
itself
bogged
down
in.
we
find
the
use
of
such
descriptive
terms
in
instance
owner
railroads
and
non-owner
railroads
and
we
find
descriptive
terms
such
as
railroads
owning
an
inadequate
supply
of
freight
cars
and
railroads
owning
an
adequate
supply
of
freight
cars.
we
find
such
times
as
railroad's
responsibility
being
shifted
for
car
ownership.
we
find
such
times
as
the
use
by
one
railroad
of
the
car
belonging
to
another
railroad
which
later
railroad
owns
a
relatively
high
number
of
freight
cars.
in
the
word
what
we
find
here
is
an
apparent
alignment
of
the
haves
against
the
have
nots
as
far
as
a
railroad
industry
is
concerned.
now
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
from
which
to
define
those
terms
or
from
which
to
identify
those
railroads
and
yet
it
is
argued
by
the
government
that
the
commission's
order
will
benefit
the
haves
and
then
it
will
deprive
or
penalize
the
have
nots.
there
seems
to
be
a
very
clear
implication
that
they
have
railroads
do
or
at
least
that
they
should
support
the
commission's
order
and
that
only
that
you
have
not
railroads
oppose
the
commission's
order,
but
do
not
be
mislead.
the
railroads
have
been
unanimous
in
their
opposition
to
this
commission's
order
from
the
very
moment
it
was
first
proposed
by
the
commission,
the
bureau
of
operations.
now
the
government
says
this
--
this
proceeding
was
instituted
to
determine,
whether
the
mandatory
rules
should
be
proposed.
the
first
statements
that
were
filed
in
a
proceeding
before
the
commission
were
addressed
to
absolutely
nothing,
and
as
the
commission's
order
did
nothing
accept
come
in
–
to
say
come
in
with
your
hat
in
hand
and
a
let
us
hear
from
you.
it
was
only
when
the
commission's
bureau
of
operations,
put
in
their
own
statements
and
they
proposed
mandatory
car
service
rules,
that
the
railroads
then
said,
we
cannot
with
live
with
any
such
provision
and
they
said
that
practically,
unanimously.
now
when
i
said
come
in
with
your
hat
in
hand
and
then
it
was
directed
at
nothing,
there
was
a
series
of
questions
that
the
commission
have
attached
to
its
order,
and
it
was
--
our
proposals
or
our
statements
who
addressed
to
that.
what
is
the
examiner
says,
it
was
pretty
much
in
a
vacuum,
and
he
laid
out
the
reasons,
why
it
seemed
to
be
pretty
much
in
a
vacuum.
now
this
evidence
contain
--
or
this
record
contains
no
evidence
at
all
as
to
which
railroads
own
an
adequate,
or
which
railroads
own
an
inadequate
supply
of
cars.
and
indeed
the
most
significant
thing
is
that,
it
contains
absolutely
no
standards
by
which
to
judge,
what
is
adequate
or
by
which
to
judge,
what
is
inadequate,
either
by
individual
railroads,
or
indeed
by
all
railroads
collectively.
i
think
the
chief
justice
asked
the
question
about
cars
sitting
around
the
country.
you
heard
government
counsel
say
that
the
commission
admitted
that
it
was
unable
to
find
a
shortage
of
freight
cars
on
any
particular
railroad.
now
obviously,
if
it
was
unable
to
find
the
shortage
of
cars
on
any
particular
railroad,
it
was
unable
to
find
a
shortage
of
cars
in
any
particular
areas
of
the
country.
because
it
would
be
very
simple
to
find
cars
shortages
on
railroads
in
the
west,
car
shortages
on
railroads
in
the
east,
car
shortages
on
railroads
in
the
south,
and
to
point
to
the
railroads,
but
the
answer
was
the
commission
could
not
do
that,
and
we
understand
why,
no
evidence
in
the
record.
now
the
same
uniform
front
of
opposition
to
the
commission's
order
applies
to
the
shippers
and
the
peculiar
thing
about
that
is,
that
it
applies
to
the
shippers,
whether
they
happened
to
be
located
on
the
so
called
have
not
railroads
and
supposedly
thereby
being
benefited
by
the
commission's
order,
or
whether
they
are
located
on
the
unidentified
have
not
railroads,
that
is
the
haves
being
benefited,
the
have
nots
being
hurt,
wherever
those
shippers
are
located,
we
found
them
unanimous,
unanimous
in
opposition
to
the
commission's
order.
indeed
you
have
in
this
case,
national
industrial
traffic
league
and
you
have
the
national
association
of
shippers
advisory
board.
put
together,
those
organizations
represent
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
about
35,000
shippers
in
the
united
states,
and
indeed
it
has
been
estimated
that
they
account
for
over
80%
of
the
commercial
traffic
in
this
country.
the
commission
justifies
its
order
on
the
basis,
that
its
primary
purpose
is
to
give
the
railroad
owners
ready
to
use
of
their
own
cars,
but
that
pointed
out
to
you
now
these
same
railroads
because
we
are
practically
unanimous
in
this,
these
same
railroads
tell
the
commission
no
thank
you.
your
order
will
be
unreasonably
injurious
and
detrimental
to
us,
and
it
will
hurt
the
shippers
that
we
serve
and
further
more
your
order
is
unlawful
and
we
cannot
live
with
it.
and
now
let
there
be
no
mistake,
the
railroads
are
not
aligned
in
groups
contending
for
and
against
this
commission's
order.
they
are
before
you
as
they
were
before
the
commission
and
before
the
court
below.
they
stand
here
united
for
all
practical
purposes,
united
in
their
opposition
to
the
commission's
order.
mr.
william
m.
moloney
well,
i
have
to
make
reservations
for
certain
things
that
were
pointed
out
such
as
the
new
haven
railroad,
which
we
think
is
a
very
unusual
situation.
i
have
to
make
exceptions
for
instance
to,
to
some
terminating
railroads,
that
--
well,
let's
say
the
florida
east
coast
railroad,
as
we've
often
said
it's
rather
hard
or
i
have
often
said
it's
rather
hard
to
load
a
car
off
to
peninsula,
florida
without
loading
it
back
in
the
direction
of
the
owner,
someone
must
own
it
somewhere.
now
the
court
below
is
not
mislead
by
any
implication
of
contending
factions
within
the
rights
of
the
railroad
industry,
or
within
shipper
rights
or
indeed
of
any
contention
between
those
two
rights.
mr.
william
m.
moloney
the
genesis
of
the
order
to
return
the
cars
to
the
owners.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
the
genesis
of
the
order
was
a
determination
by
the
commission
in
this
instance
and
we
said
so
in
our
brief
below,
a
determination
by
the
commission
in
this
instance
said
it
was
going
to
come
out
with
an
order
and
this
is
the
order
that
the
commission
came
out
with.
mr.
william
m.
moloney
no
one
that
i
know
of,
and
i
say
that
i
mean
no
significant
group
of
shippers.
indeed
in
the
government
--
government's
brief,
they
refer
to
for
instance
to
the
commission
of
the
state
of
oregon
as
supporting,
as
supporting,
mandatory
car
service
rules.
but
the
examiner
in
his
report
took
up
in
detail
the
testimony
of
the
commission
of
the
state
of
oregon
and
indeed
the
commission
rules
said,
now
when
you
file
your
evidence
before
us,
we
want
you
to
file
evidence
and
we
want
you
to
file
argument,
and
we
want
you
to
distinguish
between
the
two.
and
everything
that
the
commission
of
oregon
said
about
mandatory
car
service
rules,
the
examiner
said,
i
find
that
in
argumentative
section
of
your
presentation
and
i
do
not
consider
that
evidence.
as
far
as
the
--
as
far
as
the
department
of
agriculture
is
concerned,
and
that's
cited
in
the
commission's
brief,
the
witness
for
the
department
of
agriculture,
when
he
took
the
stand
and
submitted
himself
to
cross
examination,
he
admitted
that
they
did
not
favor
mandatory
car
service
rules,
except
on
a
temporary
basis
and
for
the
sole
purpose
of
accumulating
statistical
information
which
was
absent
from
the
record.
and
indeed,
when
i
asked
that
witness,
what
he
considered
to
be
the
worth
of
this
record,
he
said,
he
did
not
think
that
the
record
permitted
the
commission
to
make
an
intelligent
decision.
so
the
bureau
is
–
the
icc
bureau
is
practically
the
only
that
proposed
this.
now
the
origin,
the
genesis,
what
made
him
do
it,
i
have
no
idea,
but
the
proposal
of
mandatory
car
service
rules
1
and
2
for
whatever
reason,
originated
with
the
bureau
of
operations
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
as
i'll
point
out
later
with
one
man
actually.
in
fact,
i
think
we
have
referred
to
it
is
as
inspired
vision
almost
and
that
witness
is
the
only
one
that
i
know
off
that
came
out
with
this
firm
demand.
now,
the
national
transportation
policy
has
been
mentioned.
we
feel
that
the
united
front
in
opposition
to
the
commission's
order
makes
the
national
transportation
policy,
and
the
measuring
of
the
commission's
order
in
this
case,
against
that
policy
highly
important.
because
here
you
have
for
all
practical
purposes,
the
shippers
and
receivers
of
freight
and
the
railroads
that
serve
those
shippers
and
receivers
standing
before
you
and
saying
this
order
is
unlawful
and
it
is
harmful.
is
it
not
be
un-proper
that
you
look
more
carefully
at
the
national
transportation
policy
and
how
this
order
comports
with
it?
now
as
applied
to
this
case,
that
national
transportation
policy
really
means,
that
the
commission's
order
here
must
be
in
the
interest
of
providing
fair
and
impartial
regulation
of
railroads,
of
providing
the
shippers
with
economic,
adequate
and
efficient
railroads
service
and
of
fostering
sound
conditions
in
the
railroad
industry.
now
i
suppose,
we
may
treat
all
of
these
provisions
as
the
national
transportation
policy
as
something
that
would
be
embraced
within
the
general
term
of
public
interest.
but
to
the
question,
that
wherein
lies
the
public
interest
to
be
served
in
this
case,
we
are
compelled
to
submit
that
the
answer
to
that
question
can
only
be
found
in
the
interest
of
the
receivers
and
shippers
of
railroad
freight
and
of
the
railroads
it
serves
and
if
that
public
interest
can
be
found
anywhere
else,
it
escapes
us.
now
another
twist,
that
we
find
a
little
peculiar
in
this
case
is,
that
the
commission's
abrupt
departure
from
long
established
policies
and
principles
then
with
little
or
no
explanation
as
to
why
they
departed.
until
the
decision
in
this
case,
there
had
not
been
a
shadow
of
doubt
that
in
times
of
car
shortage,
the
railroads
had
an
obligation
to
achieve
and
without
regard
to
car
ownership,
the
maximum
utilization
of
all
freight
cars
available.
indeed,
the
national
transportation
policy
on
the
public
interest
to
be
served
seem
to
us
to
permit
no
other
course
of
action,
but
here
the
commission
finds
a
car
shortage,
but
it
says,
we
are
no
longer
interested
in
obtaining
maximum
utilization
of
freight
cars
during
that
shortage.
instead,
it
orders
a
movement,
a
car
movement
pattern
which
it
says
itself
is
inconsistent
with
the
maximum
utilization
of
freight
cars
during
the
time
of
the
shortage.
and
it
does
this,
it
does
this
on
the
theory
that,
that
will
force
some
unidentified
railroads
to
buy
an
indeterminate
number
of
freight
cars
and
regardless
of
their
financial
condition
to
do
so.
now
how
a
deliberate
aggravation
of
an
existing
what
they
found
to
be
an
existing
chronic
freight
car
shortage,
how
a
deliberate
aggravation
of
that
shortage
can
possibly
be
in
the
public
interest
and
comport
with
the
national
transportation
policy
is
something
that
the
commission
report
and
order
leaves
entirely
to
the
imagination
of
the
court.
now
as
we
see
it
the
commission
has
taken
what
i
term
a
page
from
the
international
diplomacy
book
and
we
think
it's
embarked
on
a
course
of
workmanship.
now
we
--
i
say
that
not
in
guess,
but
in
seriousness
because
in
both
the
jurisdictional
statement
and
the
brief,
the
government
says
that
the
order
here
in
issue
is
one
of
the
series
of
actions,
that
it
is
taken
to
alleviate
the
crisis
which
it
finds
to
exist.
i
am
sorry,
i
think
my
time
is
expired.
mr.
william
m.
moloney
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
here
representing
the
association
of
american
railroads
and
it's
member
lines.
it
is
my
purpose
and
it's
my
hope
that
i
will
be
able
to
highlight
some
of
what
we
consider
to
be
the
unusual
aspects
of
this
case
or
at
least
aspects
that
we
consider
to
be
out
of
the
ordinary.
now
the
rhetoric
used
in
this
case
might
be
the
inevitable
result
of
the
case,
and
you
heard
a
part
of
that
from
government
counsel
a
moment
ago
when
he
referred
to
owner
railroads
or
a
railroad
that
owns
almost
as
many
cars
as
it
should
own,
but
there
is
nothing
in
his
evidence
to
identify
that
railroad
or
any
other
railroad,
or
how
many
cars
that
railroad
should
own,
or
whether
it
owns
a
relatively
higher
percentage
of
cars
or
it's
relatively
low
percentage
of
cars.
now
this
is
the
rhetoric
mismatch
that
this
case
really
finds
itself
bogged
down
in.
we
find
the
use
of
such
descriptive
terms
in
instance
owner
railroads
and
non-owner
railroads
and
we
find
descriptive
terms
such
as
railroads
owning
an
inadequate
supply
of
freight
cars
and
railroads
owning
an
adequate
supply
of
freight
cars.
we
find
such
times
as
railroad's
responsibility
being
shifted
for
car
ownership.
we
find
such
times
as
the
use
by
one
railroad
of
the
car
belonging
to
another
railroad
which
later
railroad
owns
a
relatively
high
number
of
freight
cars.
in
the
word
what
we
find
here
is
an
apparent
alignment
of
the
haves
against
the
have
nots
as
far
as
a
railroad
industry
is
concerned.
now
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
from
which
to
define
those
terms
or
from
which
to
identify
those
railroads
and
yet
it
is
argued
by
the
government
that
the
commission's
order
will
benefit
the
haves
and
then
it
will
deprive
or
penalize
the
have
nots.
there
seems
to
be
a
very
clear
implication
that
they
have
railroads
do
or
at
least
that
they
should
support
the
commission's
order
and
that
only
that
you
have
not
railroads
oppose
the
commission's
order,
but
do
not
be
mislead.
the
railroads
have
been
unanimous
in
their
opposition
to
this
commission's
order
from
the
very
moment
it
was
first
proposed
by
the
commission,
the
bureau
of
operations.
now
the
government
says
this
--
this
proceeding
was
instituted
to
determine,
whether
the
mandatory
rules
should
be
proposed.
the
first
statements
that
were
filed
in
a
proceeding
before
the
commission
were
addressed
to
absolutely
nothing,
and
as
the
commission's
order
did
nothing
accept
come
in
–
to
say
come
in
with
your
hat
in
hand
and
a
let
us
hear
from
you.
it
was
only
when
the
commission's
bureau
of
operations,
put
in
their
own
statements
and
they
proposed
mandatory
car
service
rules,
that
the
railroads
then
said,
we
cannot
with
live
with
any
such
provision
and
they
said
that
practically,
unanimously.
now
when
i
said
come
in
with
your
hat
in
hand
and
then
it
was
directed
at
nothing,
there
was
a
series
of
questions
that
the
commission
have
attached
to
its
order,
and
it
was
--
our
proposals
or
our
statements
who
addressed
to
that.
what
is
the
examiner
says,
it
was
pretty
much
in
a
vacuum,
and
he
laid
out
the
reasons,
why
it
seemed
to
be
pretty
much
in
a
vacuum.
now
this
evidence
contain
--
or
this
record
contains
no
evidence
at
all
as
to
which
railroads
own
an
adequate,
or
which
railroads
own
an
inadequate
supply
of
cars.
and
indeed
the
most
significant
thing
is
that,
it
contains
absolutely
no
standards
by
which
to
judge,
what
is
adequate
or
by
which
to
judge,
what
is
inadequate,
either
by
individual
railroads,
or
indeed
by
all
railroads
collectively.
i
think
the
chief
justice
asked
the
question
about
cars
sitting
around
the
country.
you
heard
government
counsel
say
that
the
commission
admitted
that
it
was
unable
to
find
a
shortage
of
freight
cars
on
any
particular
railroad.
now
obviously,
if
it
was
unable
to
find
the
shortage
of
cars
on
any
particular
railroad,
it
was
unable
to
find
a
shortage
of
cars
in
any
particular
areas
of
the
country.
because
it
would
be
very
simple
to
find
cars
shortages
on
railroads
in
the
west,
car
shortages
on
railroads
in
the
east,
car
shortages
on
railroads
in
the
south,
and
to
point
to
the
railroads,
but
the
answer
was
the
commission
could
not
do
that,
and
we
understand
why,
no
evidence
in
the
record.
now
the
same
uniform
front
of
opposition
to
the
commission's
order
applies
to
the
shippers
and
the
peculiar
thing
about
that
is,
that
it
applies
to
the
shippers,
whether
they
happened
to
be
located
on
the
so
called
have
not
railroads
and
supposedly
thereby
being
benefited
by
the
commission's
order,
or
whether
they
are
located
on
the
unidentified
have
not
railroads,
that
is
the
haves
being
benefited,
the
have
nots
being
hurt,
wherever
those
shippers
are
located,
we
found
them
unanimous,
unanimous
in
opposition
to
the
commission's
order.
indeed
you
have
in
this
case,
national
industrial
traffic
league
and
you
have
the
national
association
of
shippers
advisory
board.
put
together,
those
organizations
represent
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
about
35,000
shippers
in
the
united
states,
and
indeed
it
has
been
estimated
that
they
account
for
over
80%
of
the
commercial
traffic
in
this
country.
the
commission
justifies
its
order
on
the
basis,
that
its
primary
purpose
is
to
give
the
railroad
owners
ready
to
use
of
their
own
cars,
but
that
pointed
out
to
you
now
these
same
railroads
because
we
are
practically
unanimous
in
this,
these
same
railroads
tell
the
commission
no
thank
you.
your
order
will
be
unreasonably
injurious
and
detrimental
to
us,
and
it
will
hurt
the
shippers
that
we
serve
and
further
more
your
order
is
unlawful
and
we
cannot
live
with
it.
and
now
let
there
be
no
mistake,
the
railroads
are
not
aligned
in
groups
contending
for
and
against
this
commission's
order.
they
are
before
you
as
they
were
before
the
commission
and
before
the
court
below.
they
stand
here
united
for
all
practical
purposes,
united
in
their
opposition
to
the
commission's
order.
mr.
william
m.
moloney
well,
i
have
to
make
reservations
for
certain
things
that
were
pointed
out
such
as
the
new
haven
railroad,
which
we
think
is
a
very
unusual
situation.
i
have
to
make
exceptions
for
instance
to,
to
some
terminating
railroads,
that
--
well,
let's
say
the
florida
east
coast
railroad,
as
we've
often
said
it's
rather
hard
or
i
have
often
said
it's
rather
hard
to
load
a
car
off
to
peninsula,
florida
without
loading
it
back
in
the
direction
of
the
owner,
someone
must
own
it
somewhere.
now
the
court
below
is
not
mislead
by
any
implication
of
contending
factions
within
the
rights
of
the
railroad
industry,
or
within
shipper
rights
or
indeed
of
any
contention
between
those
two
rights.
mr.
william
m.
moloney
the
genesis
of
the
order
to
return
the
cars
to
the
owners.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
the
genesis
of
the
order
was
a
determination
by
the
commission
in
this
instance
and
we
said
so
in
our
brief
below,
a
determination
by
the
commission
in
this
instance
said
it
was
going
to
come
out
with
an
order
and
this
is
the
order
that
the
commission
came
out
with.
mr.
william
m.
moloney
no
one
that
i
know
of,
and
i
say
that
i
mean
no
significant
group
of
shippers.
indeed
in
the
government
--
government's
brief,
they
refer
to
for
instance
to
the
commission
of
the
state
of
oregon
as
supporting,
as
supporting,
mandatory
car
service
rules.
but
the
examiner
in
his
report
took
up
in
detail
the
testimony
of
the
commission
of
the
state
of
oregon
and
indeed
the
commission
rules
said,
now
when
you
file
your
evidence
before
us,
we
want
you
to
file
evidence
and
we
want
you
to
file
argument,
and
we
want
you
to
distinguish
between
the
two.
and
everything
that
the
commission
of
oregon
said
about
mandatory
car
service
rules,
the
examiner
said,
i
find
that
in
argumentative
section
of
your
presentation
and
i
do
not
consider
that
evidence.
as
far
as
the
--
as
far
as
the
department
of
agriculture
is
concerned,
and
that's
cited
in
the
commission's
brief,
the
witness
for
the
department
of
agriculture,
when
he
took
the
stand
and
submitted
himself
to
cross
examination,
he
admitted
that
they
did
not
favor
mandatory
car
service
rules,
except
on
a
temporary
basis
and
for
the
sole
purpose
of
accumulating
statistical
information
which
was
absent
from
the
record.
and
indeed,
when
i
asked
that
witness,
what
he
considered
to
be
the
worth
of
this
record,
he
said,
he
did
not
think
that
the
record
permitted
the
commission
to
make
an
intelligent
decision.
so
the
bureau
is
–
the
icc
bureau
is
practically
the
only
that
proposed
this.
now
the
origin,
the
genesis,
what
made
him
do
it,
i
have
no
idea,
but
the
proposal
of
mandatory
car
service
rules
1
and
2
for
whatever
reason,
originated
with
the
bureau
of
operations
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
as
i'll
point
out
later
with
one
man
actually.
in
fact,
i
think
we
have
referred
to
it
is
as
inspired
vision
almost
and
that
witness
is
the
only
one
that
i
know
off
that
came
out
with
this
firm
demand.
now,
the
national
transportation
policy
has
been
mentioned.
we
feel
that
the
united
front
in
opposition
to
the
commission's
order
makes
the
national
transportation
policy,
and
the
measuring
of
the
commission's
order
in
this
case,
against
that
policy
highly
important.
because
here
you
have
for
all
practical
purposes,
the
shippers
and
receivers
of
freight
and
the
railroads
that
serve
those
shippers
and
receivers
standing
before
you
and
saying
this
order
is
unlawful
and
it
is
harmful.
is
it
not
be
un-proper
that
you
look
more
carefully
at
the
national
transportation
policy
and
how
this
order
comports
with
it?
now
as
applied
to
this
case,
that
national
transportation
policy
really
means,
that
the
commission's
order
here
must
be
in
the
interest
of
providing
fair
and
impartial
regulation
of
railroads,
of
providing
the
shippers
with
economic,
adequate
and
efficient
railroads
service
and
of
fostering
sound
conditions
in
the
railroad
industry.
now
i
suppose,
we
may
treat
all
of
these
provisions
as
the
national
transportation
policy
as
something
that
would
be
embraced
within
the
general
term
of
public
interest.
but
to
the
question,
that
wherein
lies
the
public
interest
to
be
served
in
this
case,
we
are
compelled
to
submit
that
the
answer
to
that
question
can
only
be
found
in
the
interest
of
the
receivers
and
shippers
of
railroad
freight
and
of
the
railroads
it
serves
and
if
that
public
interest
can
be
found
anywhere
else,
it
escapes
us.
now
another
twist,
that
we
find
a
little
peculiar
in
this
case
is,
that
the
commission's
abrupt
departure
from
long
established
policies
and
principles
then
with
little
or
no
explanation
as
to
why
they
departed.
until
the
decision
in
this
case,
there
had
not
been
a
shadow
of
doubt
that
in
times
of
car
shortage,
the
railroads
had
an
obligation
to
achieve
and
without
regard
to
car
ownership,
the
maximum
utilization
of
all
freight
cars
available.
indeed,
the
national
transportation
policy
on
the
public
interest
to
be
served
seem
to
us
to
permit
no
other
course
of
action,
but
here
the
commission
finds
a
car
shortage,
but
it
says,
we
are
no
longer
interested
in
obtaining
maximum
utilization
of
freight
cars
during
that
shortage.
instead,
it
orders
a
movement,
a
car
movement
pattern
which
it
says
itself
is
inconsistent
with
the
maximum
utilization
of
freight
cars
during
the
time
of
the
shortage.
and
it
does
this,
it
does
this
on
the
theory
that,
that
will
force
some
unidentified
railroads
to
buy
an
indeterminate
number
of
freight
cars
and
regardless
of
their
financial
condition
to
do
so.
now
how
a
deliberate
aggravation
of
an
existing
what
they
found
to
be
an
existing
chronic
freight
car
shortage,
how
a
deliberate
aggravation
of
that
shortage
can
possibly
be
in
the
public
interest
and
comport
with
the
national
transportation
policy
is
something
that
the
commission
report
and
order
leaves
entirely
to
the
imagination
of
the
court.
now
as
we
see
it
the
commission
has
taken
what
i
term
a
page
from
the
international
diplomacy
book
and
we
think
it's
embarked
on
a
course
of
workmanship.
now
we
--
i
say
that
not
in
guess,
but
in
seriousness
because
in
both
the
jurisdictional
statement
and
the
brief,
the
government
says
that
the
order
here
in
issue
is
one
of
the
series
of
actions,
that
it
is
taken
to
alleviate
the
crisis
which
it
finds
to
exist.
i
am
sorry,
i
think
my
time
is
expired.
