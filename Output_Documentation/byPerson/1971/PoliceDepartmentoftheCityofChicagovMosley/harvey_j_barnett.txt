mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
the
attorney
for
the
respondent
earl
d.
mosley.
this
case
is
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
and
it
has
been
consolidated
with
the
case
of
grayned
versus
the
city
of
rockford,
which
is
on
appeal
for
the
supreme
court
of
illinois.
this
case
concerns
a
disorderly
conduct
ordinance
of
the
city
of
chicago
which
prohibits
all
picketing
on
a
public
way
within
150
feet
of
a
primary
or
secondary
school.
the
ordinance
exempts
from
this
prohibition,
the
picketing
of
a
school
involved
in
a
labor
dispute.
it
became
effective
on
april
5,
1968.
since
september,
1967,
respondent
earl
d.
mosley
had
picketed
jones
commercial
high
school,
located
in
the
city
of
chicago.
he
simply
walked
in
the
public
sidewalk,
adjoining
jones
high
school,
carrying
a
sign
which
reflected
his
belief
that
jones
high
school
was
discriminating
against
blacks
in
its
admission
policies
and
in
the
treatment
that
are
afforded
to
him.
it
was
admitted
at
trial
by
the
city
that
at
all
times
mr.
mosley's
activities
were
peaceful,
orderly
and
quite.
it
was
further
admitted
at
the
trial
by
petitioners
that
at
no
time
did
mr.
mosley’s
activities
in
picketing
the
school
by
himself
or
with
a
few
other
persons
ever
caused
a
disturbance
at
the
school
or
interfered
with
traffic
around
the
school.
after
being
advised
of
the
passage
of
this
ordinance,
mr.
mosley
contacted
the
chicago
police
department
and
was
told
that
he
would
be
arrested,
if
he
continued
his
activities
in
picketing
jones.
the
city
admitted
at
trial
that
it
intended
to
enforce
this
ordinance
and
in
fact
mr.
mosley
would
be
arrested
if
he
continued
to
picket
the
school.
he
then
filed
this
declaratory
judgment
action,
seeking
a
declaratory
judgment
and
an
injunction
against
the
enforcement
of
this
ordinance.
on
the
grounds
that
had
violated
his
right
to
freedom
of
speech
and
there
was
a
violation
of
equal
protection
clause.
the
lower
court
after
a
trial,
held
that
the
ordinance
was
constitutional.
on
appeal,
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
reversed,
finding
that
the
ordinance
on
its
face
violated
mr.
mosley’s
rights
to
freedom
of
speech,
because
the
ordinance
was
overly
broad.
this
ordinance
was
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment
right
to
freedom
of
speech
because
it
is
overly
broad.
the
vice
of
this
ordinance
is
that
it
sweeps
within
its
prohibition,
protected
free
speech,
such
as
the
quite,
peaceful
picketing
of
respondent
mr.
mosley.
in
fact
mr.
mosley
engaged
in
almost
the
identical
activity
as
that
engaged
in
by
mr.
thornhill
in
the
case
of
thornhill
versus
alabama,
some
30
years
ago.
this
court
has
held
that
peaceful
picketing
is
protected
free
speech
and
the
state
can
regulate
only
the
abuses
of
picketing
which
is
articulated
as
the
test
of
the
regulation
of
the
manner
of
picketing
or
the
purpose
of
picketing
when
there
is
something
in
the
manner
or
purpose
which
gives
grounds
for
the
dis-allowance
of
that
picketing.
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
if
the
court
please
the
--
at
no
time
have
i
been
able
to
find
any
decision
of
the
court
which
has
stated
that
place
and
place
alone
is
sufficient
to
permit
the
regulation
of
picketing.
it
must
be
coupled
with
something
in
the
manner
of
picketing
or
the
purpose
of
picketing
which
would
give
grounds
for
the
disallowance
of
that
picketing.
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
well
i
would
say,
your
honor
that
that
statute
would
be
lawful,
but
your
honor
the
difference
between
that
case
and
this
case
is
that
we
have
picketing
here
on
the
public
way
which
in
no
way
--
which
prohibits
the
respondent
in
this
case
from
lawfully
and
legitimately
exercising
his
right
to
freedom
of
speech.
the
ordinance
which
your
honor
or
the
statute
which
your
honor
would
propose,
i
think
would
be
attached
to
some
legitimate
state
concern.
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
i
am
not
familiar
with
that
statute,
your
honor.
i
am
familiar
with
the
court
sanctioning
of
the
statute
in
cox
versus
louisiana
which
prohibited
the
picketing
of
a
courthouse
with
the
intent
to
influence
the
administration
of
justice.
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
that
statute
your
honor,
as
the
court
noted
in
the
cox
case,
was
one
which
specifically
dealt
with
a
purpose
of
picketing
and
the
court
found
in
that
case,
that
the
purpose
was
legitimate,
could
legitimately
be
regulated
by
the
state
because
the
state
had
a
legitimate
interest
in
protecting
courts
from
the
undue
influence
and
the
interference
with
the
administration
of
justice.
the
problem
with
the
city
of
chicago
ordinance
is
it
is
not
a
nearly
drafted
enactment,
that
aims
specifically
at
some
evil,
some
abusive
picketing.
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
it’s
an
ordinance.
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
i
think
that
statute
maybe
constitutional,
your
honor.
they
would
have
to
--
the
city
would
then
be
put
to
prove
at
a
trial
in
that
case,
that
it
was
intent
of
the
person
to
disrupt
the
school.
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
i
wouldn’t
think
that
the
city
would
have
in
that
instance
a
legitimate
right
to
be
concerned
with
the
influencing
the
administration
in
school.
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
in
that
case
the
court
went
on
at
great
length
to
note
that
picketing
around
a
courthouse
may
cause
us
an
undue
and
an
oppressive
influence
upon
jurors,
let
us
say,
who
are
attending
the
trial
in
that
particular
courthouse.
in
the
hypothetical
which
your
honor
posed,
i
would
think
that
someone
who
picketed
a
school
with
the
intent
to
influence
the
administration
of
that
school
to
get
them
to,
let’s
say,
meet
more
blacks
or
to
afford
blacks
different
treatment
such
as
mr.
mosley's
intent,
that
would
be
a
legitimate
concern
on
his
part
and
the
state
would
not
have
an
overriding
interest
in
preventing
that
type
of
conduct
and
that
type
of
free
speech.
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
that’s
true
--
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
they
both
mean
of
his
expressions
are
freedom
of
speech
and
that
is
the
problem
with
this
ordinance
because
what
mr.
mosley
was
doing,
was
exercising
nothing
more
than
protected
free
speech.
the
city
admits
that
he
never
caused
the
disturbance
or
interference
with
the
school
and
yet
this
ordinance
arbitrarily
creates
a
150-foot
limit
within
which
he
is
prevented
from
exercising
those
rights
of
freedom
of
speech.
now,
the
city
harps
over
and
over
in
their
brief
about
disturbances
and
disruptions
around
schools
as
a
means
for
justifying
this
ordinance.
but
the
simple
answer
to
that
is
that
this
ordinance
is
not
directed
at
disturbances,
at
disruptions
or
picketing
in
such
a
manner
as
to
create
disturbances
or
disruptions
around
schools.
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
i
think
the
court
in
one
of
its
decisions
indicated
that
the
rationale
of
the
embassy
ordinance
was
that
for
security
purposes
and
that
the
government
had
a
legitimate
concern
in
that
particular
instance
of
protecting
these
types
of
embassies
from
potential
violence
and
disruptions.
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
it
may
serve
their
purpose
your
honor,
but
on
the
other
hand,
it
brings
everything
within
its
ambit.
it
prohibits
all
types
of
picketing,
violent
and
disruptive
picketing
as
well
as
purely
--
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
they
are,
your
honor
and
i
would
have
my
doubts
as
to
the
constitutionality
there.
as
i
stated,
i
am
not
sure
if
that
ordinance
is
--
that
statute
has
ever
have
been
passed
upon,
but
i
think
the
rationale
was
that
there
was
a
certain
legitimate
concern
about
security
around
embassies.
i
would
think
however
that
if
one
person
was
peacefully
picketing
an
embassy,
and
one
of
the
picket
within
the
500-foot
limit
then
he
want
to
be
entitled
to
do
so
under
his
first
amendment
rights
to
freedom
of
speech
and
that
is
exactly
what
we
have
here
in
this
case
for
mr.
mosley
had
no
time
to
cause
the
disturbance
around
the
school.
he
had
at
no
time
interfered
with
the
administration
of
the
school
or
disrupted
any
school
activities.
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
no
i
think
that
there
would
be
--
the
state
would
have
the
right
to
prevent
people
who
coming
on
the
school
house
property
as
such
certainly
in
a
protection
of
students.
but
this
ordinance
is
specifically
drafted
to
be
150
--
picketing
within
150
feet
out
of
public
way,
so
--
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
yes,
i
would
think
that
on
a
public
sidewalk,
a
person
should
have
the
right
to
peacefully
picket
and
express
his
views,
and
this
court
has
always
sanctioned
the
use
of
the
public
sidewalks,
the
parks
in
the
recent
food
employees
case
as
areas
where
historical
first
amendment
rights
to
the
freedom
of
speech
has
been
sanctioned,
and
have
been
--
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
does
your
honor
mean
that
if
there
has
been
an
ordinance
prohibiting
picketing
there?
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
no
i
would
think
that
the
state
has
a
legitimate
--
this
ordinance
itself
i
don't
think
could
be
applied
in
that
fashion
your
honor.
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
because
the
150-foot
limit
is
from
the
exterior
of
the
school
--
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
i
think
that
the
state
would
have
a
legitimate
right
to
prevent
picketing
on
its
property
in
order
that
it
may
run
into
school
system.
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
because
--
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
well,
i
think
an
outsider,
your
honor,
rather
than
a
student
that
a
distinction
can
be
drawn
because
certainly
there
maybe
some
--
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
i
don't
think
the
--
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
i
don't
think
it's
a
tendency
to
disrupt
or
to
distract,
your
honor.
i
think
an
outsider
maybe
prohibited
from
coming
on
school
property
because
of
a
possible
danger
to
students,
a
threat
of
some
--
for
the
students.
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
that's
--
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
well,
i
think
that
those
would
probably
be
connected
with
the
schools
such
as
a
delivery
man
or
something
like
that
your
honor,
but
to
come
on
school
property
as
such
inside
a
building
to
picket,
i
think
might
cause
a
disruption
and
i
think
the
state
would
have
a
legitimate
concern
of
picketing
students.
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
yes,
but
i
don't
think
--
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
well,
my
argument
on
it
is
two-point,
your
honor.
one
it
may
well
cause
a
disruption
of
the
school
activities,
and
secondly
i
think
the
state
has
a
legitimate
concern
in
protecting
the
interest
of
students,
in
terms
of
bodily
harm
to
them
from
outsiders,
indiscriminately
coming
on
inside
school
--
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
well,
your
honor
i
think
it's
a
difference
in
--
a
qualitative
difference
between
someone
standing
outside
a
school
or
public
sidewalk,
walking
in
front
of
that
school,
and
between
a
person
coming
in
the
school,
whether
there
may
well
be
a
danger
of
physical
harm
to
students,
well
certainly
the
state
has
an
interest
in
protecting
--
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
that's
correct.
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
now,
the
ordinance,
the
ordinance
--
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
the
ordinance
prohibits,
your
honor,
picketing
on
a
public
way
within
150
feet
of
the
school.
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
yes,
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
yes,
that
is
our
argument
your
honor.

you.

or
the
statute
which
your
honor
would
propose,
i
think
would
be
attached
to
some
legitimate
state
concern.
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
i
am
not
familiar
with
that
statute,
your
honor.
i
am
familiar
with
the
court
sanctioning
of
the
statute
in
cox
versus
louisiana
which
prohibited
the
picketing
of
a
courthouse
with
the
intent
to
influence
the
administration
of
justice.
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
that
statute
your
honor,
as
the
court
noted
in
the
cox
case,
was
one
which
specifically
dealt
with
a
purpose
of
picketing
and
the
court
found
in
that
case,
that
the
purpose
was
legitimate,
could
legitimately
be
regulated
by
the
state
because
the
state
had
a
legitimate
interest
in
protecting
courts
from
the
undue
influence
and
the
interference
with
the
administration
of
justice.
the
problem
with
the
city
of
chicago
ordinance
is
it
is
not
a
nearly
drafted
enactment,
that
aims
specifically
at
some
evil,
some
abusive
picketing.
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
it’s
an
ordinance.
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
i
think
that
statute
maybe
constitutional,
your
honor.
they
would
have
to
--
the
city
would
then
be
put
to
prove
at
a
trial
in
that
case,
that
it
was
intent
of
the
person
to
disrupt
the
school.
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
i
wouldn’t
think
that
the
city
would
have
in
that
instance
a
legitimate
right
to
be
concerned
with
the
influencing
the
administration
in
school.
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
in
that
case
the
court
went
on
at
great
length
to
note
that
picketing
around
a
courthouse
may
cause
us
an
undue
and
an
oppressive
influence
upon
jurors,
let
us
say,
who
are
attending
the
trial
in
that
particular
courthouse.
in
the
hypothetical
which
your
honor
posed,
i
would
think
that
someone
who
picketed
a
school
with
the
intent
to
influence
the
administration
of
that
school
to
get
them
to,
let’s
say,
meet
more
blacks
or
to
afford
blacks
different
treatment
such
as
mr.
mosley's
intent,
that
would
be
a
legitimate
concern
on
his
part
and
the
state
would
not
have
an
overriding
interest
in
preventing
that
type
of
conduct
and
that
type
of
free
speech.
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
that’s
true
--
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
they
both
mean
of
his
expressions
are
freedom
of
speech
and
that
is
the
problem
with
this
ordinance
because
what
mr.
mosley
was
doing,
was
exercising
nothing
more
than
protected
free
speech.
the
city
admits
that
he
never
caused
the
disturbance
or
interference
with
the
school
and
yet
this
ordinance
arbitrarily
creates
a
150-foot
limit
within
which
he
is
prevented
from
exercising
those
rights
of
freedom
of
speech.
now,
the
city
harps
over
and
over
in
their
brief
about
disturbances
and
disruptions
around
schools
as
a
means
for
justifying
this
ordinance.
but
the
simple
answer
to
that
is
that
this
ordinance
is
not
directed
at
disturbances,
at
disruptions
or
picketing
in
such
a
manner
as
to
create
disturbances
or
disruptions
around
schools.
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
i
think
the
court
in
one
of
its
decisions
indicated
that
the
rationale
of
the
embassy
ordinance
was
that
for
security
purposes
and
that
the
government
had
a
legitimate
concern
in
that
particular
instance
of
protecting
these
types
of
embassies
from
potential
violence
and
disruptions.
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
it
may
serve
their
purpose
your
honor,
but
on
the
other
hand,
it
brings
everything
within
its
ambit.
it
prohibits
all
types
of
picketing,
violent
and
disruptive
picketing
as
well
as
purely
--
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
they
are,
your
honor
and
i
would
have
my
doubts
as
to
the
constitutionality
there.
as
i
stated,
i
am
not
sure
if
that
ordinance
is
--
that
statute
has
ever
have
been
passed
upon,
but
i
think
the
rationale
was
that
there
was
a
certain
legitimate
concern
about
security
around
embassies.
i
would
think
however
that
if
one
person
was
peacefully
picketing
an
embassy,
and
one
of
the
picket
within
the
500-foot
limit
then
he
want
to
be
entitled
to
do
so
under
his
first
amendment
rights
to
freedom
of
speech
and
that
is
exactly
what
we
have
here
in
this
case
for
mr.
mosley
had
no
time
to
cause
the
disturbance
around
the
school.
he
had
at
no
time
interfered
with
the
administration
of
the
school
or
disrupted
any
school
activities.
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
no
i
think
that
there
would
be
--
the
state
would
have
the
right
to
prevent
people
who
coming
on
the
school
house
property
as
such
certainly
in
a
protection
of
students.
but
this
ordinance
is
specifically
drafted
to
be
150
--
picketing
within
150
feet
out
of
public
way,
so
--
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
yes,
i
would
think
that
on
a
public
sidewalk,
a
person
should
have
the
right
to
peacefully
picket
and
express
his
views,
and
this
court
has
always
sanctioned
the
use
of
the
public
sidewalks,
the
parks
in
the
recent
food
employees
case
as
areas
where
historical
first
amendment
rights
to
the
freedom
of
speech
has
been
sanctioned,
and
have
been
--
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
does
your
honor
mean
that
if
there
has
been
an
ordinance
prohibiting
picketing
there?
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
no
i
would
think
that
the
state
has
a
legitimate
--
this
ordinance
itself
i
don't
think
could
be
applied
in
that
fashion
your
honor.
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
because
the
150-foot
limit
is
from
the
exterior
of
the
school
--
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
i
think
that
the
state
would
have
a
legitimate
right
to
prevent
picketing
on
its
property
in
order
that
it
may
run
into
school
system.
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
because
--
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
well,
i
think
an
outsider,
your
honor,
rather
than
a
student
that
a
distinction
can
be
drawn
because
certainly
there
maybe
some
--
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
i
don't
think
the
--
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
i
don't
think
it's
a
tendency
to
disrupt
or
to
distract,
your
honor.
i
think
an
outsider
maybe
prohibited
from
coming
on
school
property
because
of
a
possible
danger
to
students,
a
threat
of
some
--
for
the
students.
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
that's
--
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
well,
i
think
that
those
would
probably
be
connected
with
the
schools
such
as
a
delivery
man
or
something
like
that
your
honor,
but
to
come
on
school
property
as
such
inside
a
building
to
picket,
i
think
might
cause
a
disruption
and
i
think
the
state
would
have
a
legitimate
concern
of
picketing
students.
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
yes,
but
i
don't
think
--
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
well,
my
argument
on
it
is
two-point,
your
honor.
one
it
may
well
cause
a
disruption
of
the
school
activities,
and
secondly
i
think
the
state
has
a
legitimate
concern
in
protecting
the
interest
of
students,
in
terms
of
bodily
harm
to
them
from
outsiders,
indiscriminately
coming
on
inside
school
--
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
well,
your
honor
i
think
it's
a
difference
in
--
a
qualitative
difference
between
someone
standing
outside
a
school
or
public
sidewalk,
walking
in
front
of
that
school,
and
between
a
person
coming
in
the
school,
whether
there
may
well
be
a
danger
of
physical
harm
to
students,
well
certainly
the
state
has
an
interest
in
protecting
--
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
that's
correct.
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
now,
the
ordinance,
the
ordinance
--
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
the
ordinance
prohibits,
your
honor,
picketing
on
a
public
way
within
150
feet
of
the
school.
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
yes,
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
harvey
j.
barnett
yes,
that
is
our
argument
your
honor.
thank
you.
