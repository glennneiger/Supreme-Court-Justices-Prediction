70-87,
police
department

chicago
against
mosley
and
grayned
against
rockford.
i
understand
that
the
order
of
appearance
is
now
by
requested
counsel
will
be
mr.
barnett
first,
miss.
hal,
second
and
mr.
curry
and
then
mr.
quinlan,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
you
may
proceed
mr.
barnett.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
familiar
with,
i
think
it's
title
18,
section
1501,
that
forbids
picketing
on
the
sidewalk
around
this
building?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that’s
the
same
statute.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
is
a
federal
statute
that
forbids
demonstrations
of
any
kind
within
either
500
feet
or
1000
feet
of
an
embassy
of
a
foreign
country.
would
you
think
that
falls
under
the
same
vein
as
the
argument
you're
making?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
in
this
case
isn’t
the
ordinance
for
the
purpose
and
certainly
does
it
not
serve
the
purpose
of
avoiding
distractions
of
the
students
from
their
studies?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
aren't
all
types
of
picketing
prohibited
under
the
embassy
(voice
overlap)?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
miss
hal?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
a
thousand
or
more,
same
argument?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
not
agree
that
a
thousand
people
moving
around
the
entrances
of
the
school,
the
access
streets,
would
be
more
of
a
problem
than
one
person?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
would
--
what
would
be
your
view
of
the
statute
prohibiting
picketing
on
the
sidewalks
adjacent
to
this
building,
unconstitutional?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
it's
unreasonable
then
for
a
legislature
and
law
making
body,
to
conclude
that
as
many
people
as
you
have
here,
200,
has
the
tendency
to
disturb
the
educational
process?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
it's
a
denial
of
equal
protection,
if
the
law
making
body
thought
a
labor
dispute
is
entitled
to
a
higher
order
of
picketing
rights
than
just
any
other
people?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
don't
suppose
the
city
would
agree
with
you,
the
change
in
the
arguments
has
that
meaning
and
only
that
meaning
now
would
--
i
would
presume
that
they
would
bring
forth
some
other
reasons
but
i
submit
that
this
change
at
this
time
shows
that
it
has
no
compelling
state
interest.
i
wanted
to
make
a
point
about
19.2
(a).
i
already
have
mentioned
that
i
think
it
violates
due
notice,
because
the
person
cannot
know
what
conduct
is
prohibited.
so,
even
if
he
is
trying
to
comply
with
the
laws,
at
the
same
time
exercises
his
constitutional
right,
he
does
not
have
an
opportunity,
so
consequently
he
cannot
act
at
all
without
fear
of
going
to
jail.
the
other
point
is
that,
with
respect
to
19.2
(a)
as
this
ordinance
is
drafted,
it
says
that
a
person
who
willfully
makes
the
noise
or
diversion
would
violate
that
section
and
then
it
seems
to
modify
that
which
disturbs
or
tends
to
disturb
the
peace
and
good
order
of
the
school
session.
i
submit
that
what
is
happening
is
that
the
person
is
being
convicted
when
he
makes
a
noise
or
diversion
and
his
intent
is
just
to
make
the
noise
or
diversion
not
to
disturb
or
disturb
the
peace
of
good
order
of
the
school.
