what
about
the
place?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
do
you
think
the
statute
that
prohibits
you
from
picketing
where
you
are
standing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
i
am
trying
to
say
is
that
i
think
you
have
put
too
much
baggage
on
the
train,
that's
all
i
want
to
say?
justice
thurgood
marshall
ms.
hal,
are
you
willing
to
leave
that
with
the
clerk?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
said
40
were
arrested?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
were
they
all
convicted?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean,
is
this
a
symbolic
case
or
what
because
it's
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
just
that,
when
this
case
is
brought
in,
the
one
that
has
no
record
as
to
what
man
did?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
–
there
is
nothing
in
that
to
show
that
he
did
anything?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
is
anything
in
the
record
that
shows
that
mr.
grayned
opened
his
mouth,
said
anything?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
many
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
curry,
you
say
that
you
try
and
do
the
same
thing
that
you've
done
in
cox?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
it
appears
from
the
decisions
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
(inaudible)
decisions,
you
say
that's
just
a
point,
you
said
what
cox
said,
it
would
be
valid
and
nobody
said?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
says
that
it
was
because
it
was
narrowly
drawn
to
protect
the
valid
state
interest,
that's
what
he
says
in
cox.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
sir,
i'm
reading
from
judge
hastings.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you've
addressed
the
one
like
cox,
what
about
others,
that's
what
i
gather
from
this?
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
more
people
carrying
the
sign
saying
that
the
city
of
chicago
is
unfair
to
organized
labor?
justice
thurgood
marshall
within
one
foot.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mosley's
sign
said
i
support,
the
labor
dispute
between
union
abc
and
the
city
of
chicago.
i
use
the
word
labor
dispute
because
that
was
your
ordinance
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
couldn't
the
state
also
prosecute
him
under
this
ordinance?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
couldn't.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
couldn't,
could
it
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
exact
same
man,
with
exact
same
stick
with
a
different
sign
on
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
that
argument
made
in
court
of
appeals?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
was
it
mentioned
in
the
opinion
of
court
of
appeals,
this
argument?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
does
this
man
(inaudible)
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
grayned
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
in
the
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
either
or
both?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
you
make
any
notes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
was
he
convicted?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
did
he
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
--
i
assume
that
if
testimony
was
that
everybody
was
chanting,
and
a
man
who
was
in
that
group
who
was
deaf
and
dumb
could
get
convicted
under
this
statue,
ordinance
i
mean?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
would
be
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
in
the
fact
that
the
way
this
statute
was
administrated
in
this
particular
occasion
was
that
anybody
in
that
group
was
subject
to
arrest?
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
have
one
man
before
us
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
myself
i
don't
see
what
he
has
been
proved
to
have
done
to
violate
the
ordinance
even
if
it's
constitutional,
you
see
my
problem?
