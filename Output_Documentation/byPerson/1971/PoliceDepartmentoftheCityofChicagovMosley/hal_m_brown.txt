m.

mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
defendant
is
--
my
client
is
richard
grayned.
he
participated
in
a
demonstration.
he
was
arrested,
convicted
and
fined
for
violating
two
ordinances
of
the
city
of
rockford.
one
of
the
ordinances
is
the
same
as
one
in
the
mosley
case.
it
involved
not
picketing
or
demonstrating
within
an
150
feet,
and
accepted
the
person
picketing
on
the
spot
for
labor
dispute.
the
other
ordinance,
prohibited
a
person
engaged
in
conduct
wherein
he
willfully
may
or
assisted
in
the
making
of
a
noise
or
a
diversion
which
disturbed
or
tended
to
disturb,
the
peace
and
good
order
of
the
school
session.
we
defend
that
and
we
have
constantly
throughout
the
litigation
contended
that
these
two
ordinances
are
both
unconstitutional,
that
they
are
violative
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
that
it
represents
an
interference
by
the
state
with
a
person's
right
to
picket
or
to
speak
or
assemble.
the
facts
in
the
grayned
case
prior
to
proceeding
in
this
court,
have
not
been
disputed.
the
record
went
up
to
the
supreme
court
on
a
short
record.
there
was
no
transcript
of
proceeding
of
what
occurred
in
the
trial.
i
--
the
motion
which
made
before
the
illinois
supreme
court.
without
objection
of
counsel,
we
submitted
the
case
on
the
facts
as
represented
in
the
briefs
which
we
submitted.
for
the
first
time,
the
city
of
rockford
has
disputed,
the
facts
in
this
case.
and
i
submit
that
they
not
only
have
disputed
them,
but
they
have
also
made
misstatements
of
fact.
i
have
with
me,
a
report
of
proceeding
that
occurred
in
the
circuit
court
of
the
seventeenth
judicial
circuit
in
the
case
of
the
city
of
rockford
versus
richard
grayned.
this
report
of
proceedings
was
ordered
by
our
office,
and
at
our
own
expense,
but
not
supplied
by
the
city
of
rockford.
we
ordered
it
back
in
november,
and
it
was
delivered
to
us
this
past
month
on
january
17.
i
brought
this
report
of
proceedings
with
me
because
i
thought
the
court
might
be
interested
in
seeing
what
the
facts
were
in
this
case.
since
they
are
now
apparently
in
dispute.
ms.
hal
m.
brown
that
is
true,
but
the
supreme
court
did
mention
the
facts
in
the
case
that
they
thought
were
relevant
and
facts
were
set
down
in
the
brief.
the
supreme
court
stated
in
the
beginning
of
their
opinion,
that
a
demonstration
was
held
in
front
of
the
school,
what
type
of
--
ms.
hal
m.
brown
not
whatsoever.
ms.
hal
m.
brown
not
at
all,
but
the
only
reason
i
bring
this
record
to
this
court's
attention
is
that
there
are
facts
stated
in
the
appellee's
brief
which
are
not
true.
ms.
hal
m.
brown
i
certainly
intend
to
do
so,
and
i
have
mentioned
this
to
mr.
quinlan
when
i
arrived
at
court.
i
mentioned
to
him
before
lunch,
and
he
said,
he
will
think
about
it,
and
after
lunch
he
told
me
that
he
would
join
in
the
submission
of
this
reported
proceeding
and
i
intend
to
leave
it
with
the
clerk
before
i
leave.
ms.
hal
m.
brown
yes,
your
honor
it
would
be.
ms.
hal
m.
brown
i
am
arguing
over
breadth.
ms.
hal
m.
brown
that's
the
fundamental
position
with
respect
to
section
18.1
(i)
and
also
we
argue
that
18.1
(i)
violates
the
equal
protection
clause.
in
that
particular
case
--
ms.
hal
m.
brown
are
you
saying
that
if
the
ordinance
stated
that
40
or
more
people
could
demonstrate
on
--
ms.
hal
m.
brown
may
not
demonstrate,
i
would
say
it
was
unconstitutional.
ms.
hal
m.
brown
that's
right.
ms.
hal
m.
brown
your
honor,
i
think
that
to
try
and
use
numbers
as
a
150-feet
and
the
number
of
people
avoids
the
whole
problem
involved
here.
we
are
concerned
with
the
interest
of
the
state
which
are
involved.
we
are
concerned
with
what
the
people
who
are
picketing
or
concerned
about
picketing.
we
are
concerned
about
the
effect
of
their
conduct.
ms.
hal
m.
brown
if
an
ordinance
was
passed
which
said
that
there
could
not
be
so
many
people
picketing
who
obstructed
the
ingress
and
egress
with
respect
to
the
school,
who
stopped
traffic,
who
prevented
people
from
using
the
public
way,
if
that's
what
the
ordinance
says,
if
that's
what
the
ordinance
said
then
it
would
be
constitutional,
but
there
is
not
evidence
of
that
here.
there
were
200
people
in
our
particular
instance
who
walked
up
and
down
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
west
high
school
carrying
signs
which
said
that
“black
cheerleaders
may
cheer
too,”
“black
teachers,
we
want
black
teachers
for
black
history
courses.”
they
walked
up
and
down
in
a
peaceful
and
orderly
fashion
and
then
the
police
came,
they
turned
on
their
loudspeakers,
read
their
ordinances
over
the
loudspeakers
and
started
to
arrest
people.
and
the
facts
in
this
case
show
that
that's
when
it
appears
that
people
thought
what
was
going
on.
ms.
hal
m.
brown
that's
correct.
your
honor
and
i
submit
that,
that
language
is
vague
and
it
does
not
comport
with
the
standards
of
due
process
of
law
and
giving
due
notice.
the
persons
which
to
--
to
comply
with
the
law
and
who
at
the
same
time
wish
to
exercise
their
first
amendment
freedom,
does
not
give
them
an
opportunity
to
exercise
them,
but
they
don't
know
what
they
are
going
to
be
arrested
for.
ms.
hal
m.
brown
your
honor,
it's
also
based
on
the
first
amendment
because
via
why
its
vagueness,
which
violates
due
process,
it
is
subject
to
an
over
broad
application
to
perfectly
protected
constitutional
freedom.
ms.
hal
m.
brown
i
will
have
to
--
the
people
who
drafted
the
statute,
what
would
be
their
purpose
in
drafting
it?
what
state
interest
would
they
want
to
protect?
do
they
want
to
protect
this
court
from
being
disturbed?
the
statute
in
cox
versus
louisiana
concerned
one
that
was
narrowly
drawn
which
said
we
will
prohibit
picketing
of
persons
who
seek
to
disturb,
i
don't
have
exact
language
of
it,
disturb
the
processes
of
administration
of
justice.
in
that
particular
incident,
whereas
the
court
is
concerned,
and
where
the
statute
is
so
narrowly
drawn
as
this
court
held
it
was,
i
would
say
that
it
was
--
ms.
hal
m.
brown
i
think,
justice
stewart
made
the
appropriate
statement
when
he
wrote
this
court's
opinion
in
tinker
versus
des
moines.
he
said,
there
must
be
a
substantial
showing
that
there
would
be
an
interference
with
the
orderly
process
of
the
school
administration.
there
has
been
no
such
showing
in
this
particular
case,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think,
it
is
important
and
i
am
in
accord
with
this
decision,
it
is
important
that
the
students
in
our
school
be
allowed
to
see
and
to
participate
in
exercising
their
first
amendment
freedom,
so
that
in
the
school
they
are
not
only
taught
for
three
hours,
but
they
are
also
taught
how
to
be
citizens
in
this
country
and
how
to
exercise
their
rights
guaranteed
by
the
first
amendment.
ms.
hal
m.
brown
mr
grayned
was
fined
$25
for
violating
18.1(i)
and
$25
for
violating
19.2
(a),
a
torts
court
fine.
ms.
hal
m.
brown
the
what
case?
ms.
hal
m.
brown
in
the
most
of
the
cases
there
was
no
arrest,
there
was
no
conviction,
there
was
no
fine.
this
was
a
declaratory
judgment
action.
my
client
has
been
--
ms.
hal
m.
brown
the
other
action,
that's
right,
mine
concerns
two.
ms.
hal
m.
brown
19.2
(a),
second
ordinance.
ms.
hal
m.
brown
no,
it
does
not,
it
applies
to
any
person.
ms.
hal
m.
brown
yes,
i
do
and
i
also
would
say
that
it
is
significant
in
my
particular
case
that
the
city
of
rockford
has
eliminated
the
labor
picketing
distinction.
now,
section
18.1
(i)
is
just
at
all
labor
picketing,
all
picketing
completely
is
prohibited
within
150-feet
which
shows
that
at
the
time
this
ordinance
was
applied
to
my
client,
it
not
only,
it
is
a
remission
by
the
city
that
it
is
not
only
violated
the
constitution
but
or
it
showed
that
obviously
that
they
were
picketing
exemption
had
no
compelling
state
interest
to
warrant
it
being
there.
so,
at
the
time
this
ordinance
was
applied
to
my
client,
the
city
had
mis-stated,
it
violated
the
constitution.
ms.
hal
m.
brown
yes
there
is
evidence,
your
honor.
but
the
evidence
shows
the
noise
came
from
the
use
of
the
police
loudspeakers.
ms.
hal
m.
brown
there
were
200
demonstrators
who
were
in
front
of
the
school.
40
males
were
arrested
and
i
represented
the
--
ms.
hal
m.
brown
my
client,
richard
grayned.
no,
there
is
no
evidence
with
respect
to
richard
grayned
because
as
you
can
see
from
the
commonwealth's
record,
richard
grayned
was
not
charged
and
convicted
of
making
a
noise,
he
was
charged
and
convicted
of
making
a
diversion,
so
with
respect
to
him
--
ms.
hal
m.
brown
i
have
submitted
the
record
to
this
court
to
find
it.
ms.
hal
m.
brown
as
far
as
i
concede,
there
is
no
--
ms.
hal
m.
brown
we
had
not
raised
that
argument
in
our
brief,
your
honor.
i
would
suggest
that
there
was
noise
at
the
scene
and
the
noise
came
when
the
loudspeakers
were
used
by
the
police
officers.
ms.
hal
m.
brown
mr.
grayned,
that's
right.
ms.
hal
m.
brown
there
is
no
evidence
that
he
was
noisy
and
i
am
just
--
i
would
say
there
was
no
evidence
that
he
personally,
personally
himself
was
making
a
diversion.
now,
whether
they
were
considered
assisting
in
the
entire
demonstration
that
they
made
a
diversion,
i
would
say,
there's
no
evidence
for
that
because
i
say
that
the
record
will
show
that
at
the
time
there
was
evidence
that
a
large
number
of
people
standing
in
the
windows
at
the
school,
it
was
after
the
loudspeakers
were
used
by
the
police
in
reading
the
ordinances
to
them.
ms.
hal
m.
brown
no,
i
did
not
your
honor.
ms.
hal
m.
brown
there
were
40
demonstrators
who
were
arrested.
ms.
hal
m.
brown
the
--
ms.
hal
m.
brown
because
the
40
cases.
ms.
hal
m.
brown
and
that's
the
record
i
am
bringing
with
now.
ms.
hal
m.
brown
that
he
--
there
is
evidence
in
there,
that
he
participated
in
the
demonstration.
but
there
is
nothing
in
my
judgment
to
show
that
the
diversion
--
the
diversions
were
committed
by
the
demonstrator.
ms.
hal
m.
brown
i
wouldn't
be
surprised
if
he
said
something
your
honor
and
i
don't
know
what
the
record
shows
exactly,
to
his
making
comments
with
people
around
him.
ms.
hal
m.
brown
i
submit
that
i
am
here
for
richard
grayned
and
i
am
asking
this
court
to
sustain
the
faith
of
the
citizens
rockford
that
this
court
would
protect
their
rights
to
exercise
their
freedom,
which
are
protected
from
state
interference
through
the
fourteenth
amendment.

you.

picketing
who
obstructed
the
ingress
and
egress
with
respect
to
the
school,
who
stopped
traffic,
who
prevented
people
from
using
the
public
way,
if
that's
what
the
ordinance
says,
if
that's
what
the
ordinance
said
then
it
would
be
constitutional,
but
there
is
not
evidence
of
that
here.
there
were
200
people
in
our
particular
instance
who
walked
up
and
down
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
west
high
school
carrying
signs
which
said
that
“black
cheerleaders
may
cheer
too,”
“black
teachers,
we
want
black
teachers
for
black
history
courses.”
they
walked
up
and
down
in
a
peaceful
and
orderly
fashion
and
then
the
police
came,
they
turned
on
their
loudspeakers,
read
their
ordinances
over
the
loudspeakers
and
started
to
arrest
people.
and
the
facts
in
this
case
show
that
that's
when
it
appears
that
people
thought
what
was
going
on.
ms.
hal
m.
brown
that's
correct.
your
honor
and
i
submit
that,
that
language
is
vague
and
it
does
not
comport
with
the
standards
of
due
process
of
law
and
giving
due
notice.
the
persons
which
to
--
to
comply
with
the
law
and
who
at
the
same
time
wish
to
exercise
their
first
amendment
freedom,
does
not
give
them
an
opportunity
to
exercise
them,
but
they
don't
know
what
they
are
going
to
be
arrested
for.
ms.
hal
m.
brown
your
honor,
it's
also
based
on
the
first
amendment
because
via
why
its
vagueness,
which
violates
due
process,
it
is
subject
to
an
over
broad
application
to
perfectly
protected
constitutional
freedom.
ms.
hal
m.
brown
i
will
have
to
--
the
people
who
drafted
the
statute,
what
would
be
their
purpose
in
drafting
it?
what
state
interest
would
they
want
to
protect?
do
they
want
to
protect
this
court
from
being
disturbed?
the
statute
in
cox
versus
louisiana
concerned
one
that
was
narrowly
drawn
which
said
we
will
prohibit
picketing
of
persons
who
seek
to
disturb,
i
don't
have
exact
language
of
it,
disturb
the
processes
of
administration
of
justice.
in
that
particular
incident,
whereas
the
court
is
concerned,
and
where
the
statute
is
so
narrowly
drawn
as
this
court
held
it
was,
i
would
say
that
it
was
--
ms.
hal
m.
brown
i
think,
justice
stewart
made
the
appropriate
statement
when
he
wrote
this
court's
opinion
in
tinker
versus
des
moines.
he
said,
there
must
be
a
substantial
showing
that
there
would
be
an
interference
with
the
orderly
process
of
the
school
administration.
there
has
been
no
such
showing
in
this
particular
case,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think,
it
is
important
and
i
am
in
accord
with
this
decision,
it
is
important
that
the
students
in
our
school
be
allowed
to
see
and
to
participate
in
exercising
their
first
amendment
freedom,
so
that
in
the
school
they
are
not
only
taught
for
three
hours,
but
they
are
also
taught
how
to
be
citizens
in
this
country
and
how
to
exercise
their
rights
guaranteed
by
the
first
amendment.
ms.
hal
m.
brown
mr
grayned
was
fined
$25
for
violating
18.1(i)
and
$25
for
violating
19.2
(a),
a
torts
court
fine.
ms.
hal
m.
brown
the
what
case?
ms.
hal
m.
brown
in
the
most
of
the
cases
there
was
no
arrest,
there
was
no
conviction,
there
was
no
fine.
this
was
a
declaratory
judgment
action.
my
client
has
been
--
ms.
hal
m.
brown
the
other
action,
that's
right,
mine
concerns
two.
ms.
hal
m.
brown
19.2
(a),
second
ordinance.
ms.
hal
m.
brown
no,
it
does
not,
it
applies
to
any
person.
ms.
hal
m.
brown
yes,
i
do
and
i
also
would
say
that
it
is
significant
in
my
particular
case
that
the
city
of
rockford
has
eliminated
the
labor
picketing
distinction.
now,
section
18.1
(i)
is
just
at
all
labor
picketing,
all
picketing
completely
is
prohibited
within
150-feet
which
shows
that
at
the
time
this
ordinance
was
applied
to
my
client,
it
not
only,
it
is
a
remission
by
the
city
that
it
is
not
only
violated
the
constitution
but
or
it
showed
that
obviously
that
they
were
picketing
exemption
had
no
compelling
state
interest
to
warrant
it
being
there.
so,
at
the
time
this
ordinance
was
applied
to
my
client,
the
city
had
mis-stated,
it
violated
the
constitution.
ms.
hal
m.
brown
yes
there
is
evidence,
your
honor.
but
the
evidence
shows
the
noise
came
from
the
use
of
the
police
loudspeakers.
ms.
hal
m.
brown
there
were
200
demonstrators
who
were
in
front
of
the
school.
40
males
were
arrested
and
i
represented
the
--
ms.
hal
m.
brown
my
client,
richard
grayned.
no,
there
is
no
evidence
with
respect
to
richard
grayned
because
as
you
can
see
from
the
commonwealth's
record,
richard
grayned
was
not
charged
and
convicted
of
making
a
noise,
he
was
charged
and
convicted
of
making
a
diversion,
so
with
respect
to
him
--
ms.
hal
m.
brown
i
have
submitted
the
record
to
this
court
to
find
it.
ms.
hal
m.
brown
as
far
as
i
concede,
there
is
no
--
ms.
hal
m.
brown
we
had
not
raised
that
argument
in
our
brief,
your
honor.
i
would
suggest
that
there
was
noise
at
the
scene
and
the
noise
came
when
the
loudspeakers
were
used
by
the
police
officers.
ms.
hal
m.
brown
mr.
grayned,
that's
right.
ms.
hal
m.
brown
there
is
no
evidence
that
he
was
noisy
and
i
am
just
--
i
would
say
there
was
no
evidence
that
he
personally,
personally
himself
was
making
a
diversion.
now,
whether
they
were
considered
assisting
in
the
entire
demonstration
that
they
made
a
diversion,
i
would
say,
there's
no
evidence
for
that
because
i
say
that
the
record
will
show
that
at
the
time
there
was
evidence
that
a
large
number
of
people
standing
in
the
windows
at
the
school,
it
was
after
the
loudspeakers
were
used
by
the
police
in
reading
the
ordinances
to
them.
ms.
hal
m.
brown
no,
i
did
not
your
honor.
ms.
hal
m.
brown
there
were
40
demonstrators
who
were
arrested.
ms.
hal
m.
brown
the
--
ms.
hal
m.
brown
because
the
40
cases.
ms.
hal
m.
brown
and
that's
the
record
i
am
bringing
with
now.
ms.
hal
m.
brown
that
he
--
there
is
evidence
in
there,
that
he
participated
in
the
demonstration.
but
there
is
nothing
in
my
judgment
to
show
that
the
diversion
--
the
diversions
were
committed
by
the
demonstrator.
ms.
hal
m.
brown
i
wouldn't
be
surprised
if
he
said
something
your
honor
and
i
don't
know
what
the
record
shows
exactly,
to
his
making
comments
with
people
around
him.
ms.
hal
m.
brown
i
submit
that
i
am
here
for
richard
grayned
and
i
am
asking
this
court
to
sustain
the
faith
of
the
citizens
rockford
that
this
court
would
protect
their
rights
to
exercise
their
freedom,
which
are
protected
from
state
interference
through
the
fourteenth
amendment.
thank
you.
