justice
byron
r.
white
well
in
fact
you
had
it
in
--
is
it
a
statute
or
an
ordinance?
justice
byron
r.
white
an
ordinance.
this
ordinance
had
in
it
that
no
one
can
picket
within
150
feet
of
the
school
for
the
purposes
of
disrupting
the
school.
you
think
that
(inaudible)
in
cox
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
of
the
words
were
for
the
purpose
of
it
--
for
the
purpose
of
enforcing
the
administration
of
the
school?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
cox
case
it
was
for
the
purposes
of
influencing
the
administration
of
justice.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
the
picket
has
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
let's
assume
that
this
ordinance
was
applied
to
someone
picketing,
walking
up
and
down
in
the
halls
of
the
school
with
a
same
sign
and
no
showing
of
any
disturbance
or
anything
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
assume
the
ordinance
did
say
in
any
school
there
--
on
public
property,
in
the
school
building
or
within
a
150
feet
on
the
street?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
until
there
is
a
showing
of
some
destruction?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
must
be
in
terms
of
the
tendency
to
disrupt?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
to
distract?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh!
yes,
but
that
isn't
what
the
the
ordinance
says.
the
ordinance
says
you
can't
come
on
here
to
picket?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there's
a
lot
of
strangers
committed
on
the
school
property,
were
all
for
certain
purposes?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
might
cause
a
disruption?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
how
about
the
150
feet?
you
are
simply
saying
that
they
don't
have
any
basis
for
saying
that
it
might
cause
a
disruption
--
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
i
don't
think
that
that
might
cause
a
disruption
is
enough.
in
fact
in
a
recent
tinker
case
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
it
is
inside
the
school
building?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
are
just
saying
that
--
you
are
just
repeating
the
argument
in
different
words
that
in
terms
of
its
tendency
to
disrupt
the
school
and
impinge
on
the
right
of
the
students?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
ordinance
says,
you
can't
come
in
and
communicate
with
students
with
a
sign
in
the
hallway
of
the
school,
that's
what
the
ordinance
says?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
hasn't
anything
to
do
with
physical
thing?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
has
to
do
with
the
insulating
students
and
the
faculty
members
or
anybody
else
in
the
building
from
communication
like
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
ms.
hal,
as
i
read
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
it
didn't
treat
any
factual
issue.
i
gathered
it
was
just
an
appeal
on
the
question
whether
a
statute
or
an
ordinance
such
as
it
was
constitutional.
would
you
agree
that
that
was
a
correct
reading
at
least
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois'
opinion?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
your
submission
that
this
ordinance
has
said,
all
demonstrations
of
40
or
more
people
within
a
150-feet
of
the
school
building
are
prohibited?
if
the
ordinance
said
that
in
so
many
words,
is
it
your
submission
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
not
just
arguing
over
breadth
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
your
fundamental
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
are
also
saying,
i
take
it
that
even
if
this
ordinance
were
limited
to
just
covering
demonstrations
of
40
or
more
people,
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
may
not
--
may
not
demonstrate.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
argument
is
not
just
over
breadth.
it
is
just
particular
activity
that
was
actually
carried
on,
may
not
be
prohibited?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
different
from
the
other
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
other
cases
involved
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
at
least
the
other
action
concerns
only
one
ordinance?
justice
byron
r.
white
two
ordinances?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
don't
suggest
that
you
should
have
judgment
here
because
this
case
may
have
involved
a
lot
of
people
or
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
suggest
that
you
should
lose
this
case
if
the
ordinance
is
unconstitutional
if
applied
to
one
person
picketing?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
ordinance
on
its
face
would
apply
to
one
person
picketing
the
school?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
it
were
unconstitutional,
if
it
did
that,
would
you
say
the
the
ordinance
is
invalid
on
its
face?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
said
that
wasn't
the
speech
case,
i
approached
it
as
a
non-speech
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
not
strictly,
but
it
does
have
no
relevance?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
are
saying
that
that
it
would
be
fair
to
your
side
to
consider
this
case
though
we
had
a
one
person
picket
and
the
ordinance
would
apply
to
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
beyond
noise
and
diversion?
what
is
just
beyond
protection
against
the
noise
and
diversion
does
the
anti-picketing
ordinance
protect
against?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
in

you
had
it
in

is
