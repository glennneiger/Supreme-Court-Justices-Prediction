mr.
richard
l.
curry
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issues
of
this
case
as
viewed
by
the
city
of
chicago
are
three.
does
the
claim
of
a
free
man
to
use
the
streets
as
a
public
forum
exclude
even
modest
regulations
as
to
the
time
and
place
within
which
his
rights
maybe
exercised.
two,
if
modest
regulations
are
permissible
in
protecting
substantial
governmental
interest,
is
chicago
in
error
in
ascribing
such
importance
to
its
schools
and
three,
is
the
chicago
ordinance
void
by
reason
of
being
over
broad.
the
city
of
chicago
believes
that
the
rule
of
this
case
ought
to
answer
each
question
in
the
negative.
the
ordinance
before
the
court
is
at
partial
restriction
as
to
picketing
and
demonstrating
around
elementary
and
secondary
schools.
reasonable
as
to
time,
that
is
during
classes
and
a
half
hour
before
and
after,
and
reasonable
i
submit
as
to
place,
that
is
within
150
feet
of
the
school
building.
when
local
government
is
attempting
to
harmonize
and
accommodate,
conflicting
demands
for
the
use
of
streets,
the
standards
as
to
time
and
place
or
every
bit
as
relevant
as
the
controls
upon
manner
and
purpose.
this
ordinance
ought
not
to
be
viewed
as
a
ban
on
first
amendment
rights.
it
is
clearly
and
properly,
a
phrasing
or
timing
of
the
activities
in
recognition,
that
at
a
certain
time
and
within
a
certain
limited
area,
there
does
exist
competing
interest
which
the
city
may
rightly
acknowledge
and
regulate.
the
purpose
of
the
ordinances
and
the
reason
for
its
passage
and
the
reason
for
the
phasing
and
timing
contained
in
it,
is
that
the
city
sought
to
impose
a
very
simple
ordinance
on
school
picketing.
the
city
council
sought
to
assure
that
school
kids
have
a
setting
for
education
where
tranquility,
order,
calm
and
quite
might
prevail
or
at
least
not
be
minimized
by
introducing
picketing
or
demonstrating
in
a
customary
counterparts.
adderley
versus
florida
tells
us,
that
there
maybe
some
public
places
which
are
so
clearly
committed
to
other
purposes,
that
their
use
for
airing
grievances
is
anomalous.
in
adderley,
it
was
the
private
drive
way
to
the
jail.
in
cox
versus
louisiana,
it
was
near
a
courthouse
and
in
cameron
versus
johnson,
it
was
access
to
public
buildings.
chicago
believes
that
the
school
house
ought
to
receive
similar
insulation
from
what
has
been
traditionally
described
as
speech
plus
activities,
while
classes
are
in
session.
the
ordinance
in
chicago
was
passed
in
response
to
widespread
and
ugly
demonstrations,
which
were
taking
place
on
the
daily
basis
at
elementary
schools,
where
black
students
were
being
bused
for
the
first
time.
the
respondent
mosley
would
have
this
court
believe
that
an
ordinance
with
such
a
derivation
was
nearly
ploy
for
stifling
his
cry
for
a
larger
black
enrollment
at
jones
commercial
high
school.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
the
court's
found
the
ordinance
of
the
city
of
chicago
to
be
overbroad
and
answered
no
further
questions
in
issue,
justice
marshall,
my
recollection
--
mr.
richard
l.
curry
you're
reading
from
cox,
sir.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
it's
my
recollection,
i
certainly
don't
quarrel
with
you
reading
of
the
order
sir.
the
court's
order
in
my
interpretation
was,
it
was
strictly
and
solely
out
on
overbreadth
that
it
did
classify
--
mr.
richard
l.
curry
we
submit,
justice
marshall,
that
this
is
very
narrow.
this
ordinance
is
narrow
and
is
not
vague.
the
ordinance
is
precisely
drawn
and
patently
designed
to
accomplish
its
objectives.
it
thus
fits
the
court's
off,
repeated
description
of
the
kind
of
law
that
should
be
drawn
in
the
state's
exercise
of
generally
unquestioned
constitutional
power
to
regulate
picketing
and
street
activity.
the
ordinance
does
as
thornhill
directs
us,
aims
specifically
at
evils,
within
the
allowable
area
of
state
control
and
does
not
leave
one
to
guess
at
where
fanciful
possibilities
end
and
intended
coverage
begins.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
justice
brennan,
the
exemption
for
labor
picketing
has
a
derogation
in
these
facts.
the
primary
goal
of
this
legislation
was
public
issue
picketing.
that
was
the
question
that
the
city
of
chicago
was
confronted
with
on
its
streets
at
the
time
this
ordinance
came
up.
there
was
then
no,
none
--
nor
had
there
been
in
the
memory
of
those
in
the
city
council,
any
public
school
labor
picketing
at
all.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
yes,
but
public
picketing,
when
in
illinois,
when
it
involves
school
teachers
or
school
employees,
public
employees
generally,
is
determined
by
the
rule
of
law
in
illinois
that,
that
picketing
is
contrary
to
public
policy
and
can
be
enjoined
by
a
state
action.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
you
would
have
the
kind
that
could
be
enjoined
by
appropriate
state
action,
a
remedy
being
available
to
meet
this
possibility,
the
city
of
chicago
felt
in
drawing
a
very
narrow
ordinance,
we
would
only
relate
our
ordinance
to
the
experiences
that
were
then
prevalent
in
the
streets.
that
was
labor,
not
labor
picketing,
but
public
issue
picketing.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
within
150
feet
of
the
school
--
mr.
richard
l.
curry
within
one
foot,
the
city
of
chicago
--
well,
that
would
be
picketing
--
that
would
not
be
labor
picketing
at
a
school.
he
would
be
in
the
same
posture
i
submit
as
he
was
by
carrying
a
sign
that
said
(voice
overlap)
rationally.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
right.
rather
than
quarrel
on
the
terms
of
what
mosley
sign
says,
that
mosley's
sign
is
clearly
or
appropriately
considered
a
labor
picketing
sign,
justice
marshall,
then
clearly,
he
would
fall
within
the
exception
here
and
the
state
action
against
him
would
be
in
the
nature
of
an
injunction
because
--
mr.
richard
l.
curry
the
city
of
chicago
would
prosecute
him
under
this
ordinance
only
--
mr.
richard
l.
curry
i'm
sorry.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
if
you're
engaged
in
labor
picketing,
it
could
not
prosecute
him
under
this
ordinance
clearly.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
a
different
sign,
because
there
are
an
array,
a
plethora
of
remedies
available
to
the
law
enforcement
agencies
under
the
nlrb
act,
because
he's
a
public
employee,
his
activities
can
be
enjoined
under
the
public
policy
of
the
state
of
illinois.
this
court
has
found
that
classifications
would
only
be
stricken
if
they
are
invidious,
i
submit
that
this
is
not
an
invidious
classification.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
i
didn't
make
the
argument
there,
sir.
i
am
not
certain
sir.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
the
argument
on
invidious
discrimination,
to
my
recollection
it
was
not.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
the
national
labor
relations
act
exempts
the
public
employee,
you're
right,
but
that
public
employee
then,
if
he
is
picketing
would
find
that
the
state
would
be
enacting
the
thrust
of
public
policy
and
enjoining
his
conduct.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
the
state
preemption
for
the
public
employees
and
it
would
be
national
labor
relations
board,
national
federal
preemption
for
those
employees
who
were
neither
civil
--
public
issue
oriented,
public
employee
related,
that
would
be
a
third
category
and
we
feel,
we
felt
that
the
time
this
ordinance
was
drafted
that
there
was
adequate
remedies
for
the
other
two
eventualities
around
our
schools.
that
was
not
adequate
protection
for
the
school
children
against
the
kinds
of
distractions
and
disturbances
that
generally
and
usually
follow
the
picketing
and
demonstrating
in
the
street.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
there
is
not.
a
bias
posture
in
this
case,
if
the
court
please,
mosley
would
arrogate
to
himself
unimpeded
use
of
the
sidewalk
actually
abutting
the
school.
there
is
choice
of
the
public
forum
to
remain
unencumbered
by
restrictions
as
to
time
and
place
so
long
as
he
is
peaceful.
and
enough
gain
is
staged,
he
addresses
his
protest
to
what
is
clearly
a
captive
audience.
the
students
themselves
forced
to
attend
by
state
regulations
requiring
daily
attendance.
having
rejected
the
alternative
of
being
across
the
street
or
the
alternative
of
coming
back
when
school
is
out,
it
is
clear
that
the
mosley's
protest
is
intended
primarily
for
student
consumption
and
here
the
analogy
between
mosley
and
the
hate-oriented
group
that
meets
the
bus
at
the
other
school
and
which
this
ordinance
is
related
directly
to
becomes
clear
for
the
first
time.
the
analogy
is
absolutely
precise
because
there
too
the
activity
is
intended
for
student
consumption.
while
respondent
cleverly
tests
this
ordinance
without
arrest
and
jokingly
characterizes
his
presence
at
jones
as
“sort
of
a
nuisance
value
especially
when
i
was
in
private
school,”
the
real
object
of
this
ordinance
that
harassing,
bullying,
snarling,
threatening
and
intimating
entrance
way
mob
waits
in
the
illinois
appellate
court
for
this
decision
to
resolve
their
case.
the
liberty
guaranteed
by
the
constitution
is
liberty
regulated
by
law
and
social
compact
and
in
order
that
all
men
may
enjoy
liberty,
it
is
but
the
tritest
truism
to
say
that
every
man
ought,
if
not
must,
renounce
unbridled
license.
liberty
can
only
be
exercised,
this
court
reminded
us
in
the
cox's
case,
liberty
can
only
be
exercised
in
a
system
of
law
which
safeguards
ordinance.
for
these
reasons
and
for
those
elaborated
in
our
principal
reply
brief
and
in
recognition
of
the
substantial
governmental
interest
in
education
and
the
relevancy
of
the
time
and
place
criteria
established
by
the
chicago
ordinance
in
protecting
that
substantial
governmental
interest
from
disturbance
and
distraction,
i
would
hope
that
this
court
would
reverse
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
and
uphold
the
validity
of
the
section
193
of
the
municipal
code
of
the
city
of
chicago.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issues
of
this
case
as
viewed
by
the
city
of
chicago
are
three.
does
the
claim
of
a
free
man
to
use
the
streets
as
a
public
forum
exclude
even
modest
regulations
as
to
the
time
and
place
within
which
his
rights
maybe
exercised.
two,
if
modest
regulations
are
permissible
in
protecting
substantial
governmental
interest,
is
chicago
in
error
in
ascribing
such
importance
to
its
schools
and
three,
is
the
chicago
ordinance
void
by
reason
of
being
over
broad.
the
city
of
chicago
believes
that
the
rule
of
this
case
ought
to
answer
each
question
in
the
negative.
the
ordinance
before
the
court
is
at

as

and

around
elementary
and
secondary
schools.
reasonable
as
to
time,
that
is
during
classes
and
a
half
hour
before
and
after,
and
reasonable
i
submit
as
to
place,
that
is
within
150
feet
of
the
school
building.
when
local
government
is
attempting
to
harmonize
and
accommodate,
conflicting
demands
for
the
use
of
streets,
the
standards
as
to
time
and
place
or
every

as
the
controls
upon
manner
and
purpose.
this
ordinance
ought
not
to
be
viewed
as
a
ban
on
first
amendment
rights.
it
is
clearly
and
properly,
a
phrasing
or
timing
of
the
activities
in
recognition,
that
at
a
certain
time
and
within
a
certain
limited
area,
there
does
exist
competing
interest
which
the
city
may
rightly
acknowledge
and
regulate.
the
purpose
of
the
ordinances
and
the
reason
for
its
passage
and
the
reason
for
the
phasing
and
timing
contained
in
it,
is
that
the
city
sought
to
impose
a

adderley
versus
florida
tells
us,
that
there
maybe
some
public
places
which
are
so
clearly
committed
to
other
purposes,
that
their
use
for
airing
grievances
is
anomalous.
in
adderley,
it
was
the
private
drive
way
to
the
jail.
in
cox
versus
louisiana,
it
was
near
a
courthouse
and
in
cameron
versus
johnson,
it
was
access
to
public

chicago
believes
that
the

mr.

the

found

mr.

yes,
but
public
picketing,
when
in
illinois,
when
it

foot,
the

of

--
well,
that
would

--
that
would

if
you're
engaged
in
labor
picketing,
it
could
not
prosecute
him
under
this
ordinance
clearly.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
a
different
sign,
because
there
are
an
array,
a
plethora
of
remedies
available
to
the
law
enforcement
agencies
under
the
nlrb
act,
because
he's
a
public
employee,
his
activities
can
be
enjoined
under
the
public
policy
of
the
state
of
illinois.
this
court
has
found
that
classifications
would
only
be
stricken
if
they
are
invidious,
i
submit
that
this
is
not
an
invidious
classification.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
i
didn't
make
the
argument
there,
sir.
i
am
not
certain
sir.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
the
argument
on
invidious
discrimination,
to
my
recollection
it
was
not.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
the
national
labor
relations
act
exempts
the
public
employee,
you're
right,
but
that
public
employee
then,
if
he
is
picketing
would
find
that
the
state
would
be
enacting
the
thrust
of
public
policy
and
enjoining
his
conduct.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
the
state
preemption
for
the
public
employees
and
it
would
be
national
labor
relations
board,
national
federal
preemption
for
those
employees
who
were
neither
civil
--
public
issue
oriented,
public
employee
related,
that
would
be
a
third
category
and
we
feel,
we
felt
that
the
time
this
ordinance
was
drafted
that
there
was
adequate
remedies
for
the
other
two
eventualities
around
our
schools.
that
was
not
adequate
protection
for
the
school
children
against
the
kinds
of
distractions
and
disturbances
that
generally
and
usually
follow
the
picketing
and
demonstrating
in
the
street.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
there
is
not.
a
bias
posture
in
this
case,
if
the
court
please,
mosley
would
arrogate
to
himself
unimpeded
use
of
the
sidewalk
actually
abutting
the
school.
there
is
choice
of
the
public
forum
to
remain
unencumbered
by
restrictions
as
to
time
and
place
so
long
as
he
is
peaceful.
and
enough
gain
is
staged,
he
addresses
his
protest
to
what
is
clearly
a
captive
audience.
the
students
themselves
forced
to
attend
by
state
regulations
requiring
daily
attendance.
having
rejected
the
alternative
of
being
across
the
street
or
the
alternative
of
coming
back
when
school
is
out,
it
is
clear
that
the
mosley's
protest
is
intended
primarily
for
student
consumption
and
here
the
analogy
between
mosley
and
the
hate-oriented
group
that
meets
the
bus
at
the
other
school
and
which
this
ordinance
is
related
directly
to
becomes
clear
for
the
first
time.
the
analogy
is
absolutely
precise
because
there
too
the
activity
is
intended
for
student
consumption.
while
respondent
cleverly
tests
this
ordinance
without
arrest
and
jokingly
characterizes
his
presence
at
jones
as
“sort
of
a
nuisance
value
especially
when
i
was
in
private
school,”
the
real
object
of
this
ordinance
that
harassing,
bullying,
snarling,
threatening
and
intimating
entrance
way
mob
waits
in
the
illinois
appellate
court
for
this
decision
to
resolve
their
case.
the
liberty
guaranteed
by
the
constitution
is
liberty
regulated
by
law
and
social
compact
and
in
order
that
all
men
may
enjoy
liberty,
it
is
but
the
tritest
truism
to
say
that
every
man
ought,
if
not
must,
renounce
unbridled
license.
liberty
can
only
be
exercised,
this
court
reminded
us
in
the
cox's
case,
liberty
can
only
be
exercised
in
a
system
of
law
which
safeguards
ordinance.
for
these
reasons
and
for
those
elaborated
in
our
principal
reply
brief
and
in
recognition
of
the
substantial
governmental
interest
in
education
and
the
relevancy
of
the
time
and
place
criteria
established
by
the
chicago
ordinance
in
protecting
that
substantial
governmental
interest
from
disturbance
and
distraction,
i
would
hope
that
this
court
would
reverse
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
and
uphold
the
validity
of
the
section
193
of
the
municipal
code
of
the
city
of
chicago.
thank
you
very
much.
