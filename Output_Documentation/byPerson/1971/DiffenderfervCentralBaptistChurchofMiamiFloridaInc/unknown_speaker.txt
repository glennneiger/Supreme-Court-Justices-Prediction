unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
mr.
pfeffer.
i
wonder
before
you
begin,
the
attorney
general
of
florida
has
filed
a
suggestion
which
as
i
read
it
says
that
this
exemption
is
no
longer
available
under
florida
law
and
this
is
to
which
i
wish,
if
you
would,
you
particularly
address
this
up.
it
says
that
under
florida
law,
this
particular
property
even
if
there
is
a
reversal
cannot
be
subjected
to
tax.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
let
me
see
now,
you
mean
even
if
the
tax,
it
we
were
to
reverse
and
the
tax
for
the
past
years
is
not
collectible,
you
say
it
is
collectible?
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
one
that
concerned
me.
i
thought
the
state
was
suggesting
that
there
was
no
such
provision.
unknown
speaker
well,
perhaps
i
should
ask
your
adversary,
then
i
would
be
taking
more
of
your
time.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it,
you
would
concede
if
there
were
no
tax
collectible
in
the
event
you
prevailed
then
this
case
would
be
moot,
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
let
me
put
you
a
hypothesis
mr.
pfeffer,
only
one,
would
this
case
be
moot
if
in
fact,
if
you
prevailed
and
the
property
were
taxable,
nevertheless
the
tax
is
not
collectible
under
florida
law.
unknown
speaker
you
know,
as
you
know
mr.
pfeffer,
i
am
sure,
florida
has
a
rule
sometimes
of
which
many
others
--
unknown
speaker
which
permits
us
to
submit
the
state
law
questions
to
the
florida
supreme
court
before
we
decide
a
constitutional
question,
we
have
done
that
in
many
of
the
cases.
you
do
not
think
this
might
be
an
appropriate
case?
unknown
speaker
so
do
you
mean,
they
are
rented
out
commercially
over
those,
they
have
an
operator
on
(voice
overlap)
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
this
operation
is
regular?
unknown
speaker
are
these
church
employees
or
they
attendants?
unknown
speaker
stipulation
of
facts
does
not
cover
that
all?
unknown
speaker
what
would
you
say
if
the
church
has
made
the
lot
available
to
the
general
public
during
the
week
at
no
cost?
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
non-religious
purpose?
unknown
speaker
what
--
where
are
the
stipulations
with
respect
to
this
aspect
of
the
lemon,
are
they
here
in
the
appendix
somewhere?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
do
not
want
it.
i
do
not
want
it,
it
will
take
more
of
your
time,
i
could
find
if
there
in
the
appellee’s
briefs.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
alright.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
--
i
do
not
believe
the
state
is
saying
anything
indifferently
what
they
say
at
page
3
is
that
back
assessment
construed
by
the
florida
supreme
courts
to
be
inapplicable
because
of
a
estoppel
of
service.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
do
not
know
about
that.
unknown
speaker
yes.
but
who
collect
--
is
the
public
authority
that
have
to
collect
the
tax?
unknown
speaker
so
the
back
taxes
would
have
to
be
collected,
not
by
you
but
by
the
florida
public
authorities,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well
let
us
say
that
this
doctrine,
the
stopple
may
not
be
applied
if
they
made
that
effort.
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
no.
who
makes
that
decision
whether
the
estopple
there
applies
or
not?
unknown
speaker
all
the
florida
cases,
according
to
the
statement
and
that
is
that
they
cannot
collect
them
if
the
taxing
authorities
were
stopped
from
collecting.
unknown
speaker
well,
tell
me
if
the
facts
here
--
were
or
that
the
taxing
authorities
are
not
stopped
on
that
premise
that
they
are
stopple
from
collecting
these
back
taxes.
on
that
premises
would
this
case
be
moot?
unknown
speaker
therefore
the
case
would
be
moot.
unknown
speaker
that
is
for
the
year
1971?
unknown
speaker
i
see
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
general
(voice
overlap)
applicable
to
all
exemptions.
unknown
speaker
if
it
is
solicited
thing
--
if
it
is
solicited
by
the
assessing
authorities
as
exempt,
you
are
telling
us
that
under
florida
law
that
does
establish
a
stopple
against
the
taxing
authorities
subsequently
(voice
overlap)?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
well,
does
this
not
mean
if
that
so
that
the
relevance
of
a
new
statute
is
really
irrelevant
to
the
issue
of
mootness?
unknown
speaker
because
what
you
are
telling
us
is
we
could
never
reach
this
question
since
and
no
--
and
in
no
circumstances
could
these
taxes
ever
be
collected?
unknown
speaker
where
is
the
appendix?
unknown
speaker
unless
they
take
it,
page
three?
unknown
speaker
well,
tell
me
under
the
new
statute,
you
know
that
statute
is
not
before
us,
notwithstanding
all
of
this
that
the
church
is
going
to
have
to
pay
some
part
of
the
tax
that
some
it
is
--
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course
it
has
to
be
50%
or
something.
unknown
speaker
and
of
course
the
court
--
unknown
speaker
i
was
just
wondering
if
[inaudible]
it
say
so
factly
that
this
is
an
absolute
essential
to
the
church
services,
whether
the
news
--
new
statute
as
applied
to
this
may
not
run
to
the
total.
unknown
speaker
tell
me,
suppose
this
--
the
church
for
ten
miles
in
this
parking
lot.
what
parking
lot
was
because
the
church
needed
supplement
--
to
supplement
its
income.
actually
released
as
a
commercial
parking
lot
of
seven
days
a
week
and
the
evidence
were
that
that
income
was
absolutely
essential
that
the
church
itself
would
have
to
close
down.
are
there
any
--
under
florida
law
would
the
--
this
parking
lot
would
be
exempt?
unknown
speaker
suppose
it
were
owned
by
a
charitable
corporation
--
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
think
i
--
unknown
speaker
florida
does
not
impose
that
(inaudible)
taxes
and
stocks
and
bonds,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
mr.
whelan
it
did
and
the
--
if
you
have
the
problem
here
whether
churches
with
endowments,
aided
of
the
stocks
and
bonds
--
unknown
speaker
there
have
to
be
in
new
jersey?
unknown
speaker
mr.
whelan,
i
am
just
curious
i
think
i
know
the
answer.
does
the
church
have
any
federal
income
tax
complication
with
respect
to
this
parking
lot?
is
the
income
taxable,
federal
income
tax?
unknown
speaker
exclude
to
rentals?
unknown
speaker
at
anytime
has
it
ever
paid
federal
income
tax?
unknown
speaker
and
you
are
assuming
a
for
example
that
in
this
case
the
church
could
sell
its
parking
lot
to
a
corporation
and
then
retain
the
shares
in
the
corporation?
unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
mr.
pfeffer.
i
wonder
before
you
begin,
the
attorney
general
of

filed
a

which
as
i

it
says
that
under
florida
law,
this
particular
property
even
if
there
is
a

cannot
be
subjected
to

is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
let
me
see
now,
you
mean
even
if
the
tax,
it
we
were
to
reverse
and
the
tax
for
the
past
years
is
not
collectible,
you
say
it
is
collectible?
unknown

that

in

if

nevertheless
the

no,

who

all

on

therefore
