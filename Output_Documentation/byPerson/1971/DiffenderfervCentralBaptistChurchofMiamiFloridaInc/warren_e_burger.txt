so,
you
do
not
think
it
is
necessary,
do
you
think
it
would
be
an
appropriate
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
municipality
could
easily
control
that
competitive
aspect,
could
it
not
by
prescribing
rates?
is
the
competitive
factor
really
very
important?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
just
thought
you
were
resting
too
much
on
the
competitive
factor
when
the
municipality
could
govern
that
by
fixing
all
the
rates
for
all
the
parking
lots
so
that
one
could
not
undercut
the
other.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
suspend
for
lunch.
mr.
pfeffer
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
hollander.
chief
justice
warren
e.

thank
you.
mr.

chief

warren
e.
burger
what
are
your
tax
years?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
that
--
is
that
in
the
record,
that
october
date?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
is
it
clear
that
is
–
or
property
inavertably
admitted
or
admitted
for
any
reasons
at
all
could
not
be
placed
on
after
the
(voice
overlap).
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
principle
applicable
to
ay
kind
of
exemption?
that
is
--
that
you
have
many
grounds
i
take
it
for
exempting
properly
back
taxing
(voice
overlap)?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
if
the
new
statute
had
not
be
adopted
as
justice
brennan
suggest.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
we
can
write
that
out
of
the
case
in
your
view?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it
you
have
conceived
that
florida
could
eliminate
exemption
all
together.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
now
if
you
suggest
that
this
new
statute
just
gives
a
partial
exemption
to--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
under
that
statute
would
it
be
possible
for
the
church
to
just
layout
the
square
footage
and
carve
off
to
be
safe
49%
of
it
and
rent
the
49%
out?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
it
would
reserve
the
others
for
church
purposes
during
the
week
as
well
as
on
sunday.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
there
is
no
state,
no
florida
state
income
tax
or
at

has
not
been
for
a
while?
