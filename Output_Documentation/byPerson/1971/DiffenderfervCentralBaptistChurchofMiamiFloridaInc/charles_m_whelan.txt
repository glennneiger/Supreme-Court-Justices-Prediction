mr.
charles
m.
whelan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court?
the
tax
exemption
that
is
involved
in
this
case
is
possibly
singular
in
the
history
of
american
tax
law
but
it
is
certainly
extinct.
the
statute
has
been
changed.
this
particular
tax
exemption
will
not
be
available
after
the
end
of
this
year
and
this
year’s
tax
year
is
already
closed.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
well
it
begins
in
january
and
by
the
first
monday
on
october,
if
the
roles
are
furnished
and
nothing
more
can
be
done.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
no.
but
it
is
in
the
statute
that
governs
the
assessments.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
oh,
no.
under
florida
law
where
there
has
been
simple
inadvertence
or
even
positive
neglect,
back
taxes
can
be
assessed
for
a
period
of
three
years.
that
is
clear
from
the
terms
of
the
statute
and
from
the
construction
of
that
statute
in
city
of
naples
against
convoy,
however,
where
the
taxing
authority
has
positively
and
affirmatively
treated
the
property
as
exempt
as
it
has
in
this
case
since
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
then
the
taxing
authority
cannot
change
its
position
after
the
roles
have
been
endorsed
on
the
first
embank
october.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
yes.
this
is
a
general
role.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
(voice
overlap)
foreclosing
the
assessment.
for
all
tax
--
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
now
it
is
true
that
in
the
city
of
naples
case
that
the
florida
supreme
court
allowed
the
taxpayers
who
were
the
plaintiffs
in
that
suit
and
who
were
trying
to
compel
the
city
of
naples
to
disregard
a
contract
that
entered
into
for
an
exemption
for
a
real
estate
development.
it
is
true
that
the
supreme
court
of
florida
said
that
while
the
city
could
not
be
compelled
to
collect
taxes
for
the
three
years
prior
to
the
commencement
of
the
litigation
that
they
could
collect
taxes
for
the
years
during
which
the
litigation
proceeded.
so
in
so
far
as
the
plaintiffs
make
the
contention
that
at
least
the
current
year’s
tax
is
still
at
issue
at
least
that
much
because
a
court
order
could
change
the
roles.
my
answer
to
that
is
that
the
doctrine
of
equitable
stopple
as
it
has
been
applied
in
the
coppock
case
and
the
city
of
naples
case
would
clearly
result
in
a
decision
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida
that
these
--
the
tax
commissioner
here
cannot
change
their
minds.
we
are
the
ones
who
relied
on
the
supreme
court
of
florida’s
decision
in
the
suit
brought
some
years
ago
by
the
accounting.
so
we
have
had
the
assurance
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
that
we
meet.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
yes
it
is.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
that
is
my
contention
your
honor.
and
it
seems
clear
to
me
that
the
law
of
florida
is
quite
clear
on
this
point.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
yes
your
honor.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
yes,
however
if
the
statute,
the
old
statute
were
still
on
the
books
then
it
would
seem
me
the
--
at
least
the
question
of
the
old
statute
would
still
be
around
but
it
is
not
a
round.
and
if
the
plaintiff,
the
appellants
are
correct
which
i
do
not
concede
but
they
are
correct
in
saying
that
florida
is
really
out
of
the
line
of
america
tax
tradition,
you
know
with
this
type
of
statute
and
then
it
goes
in
the
teeth
of
the
whole
history
as
anglo-american
tax
law
then
clearly
this
case
becomes
totally
insignificant.
the
statute
no
longer
exists
and
if
they
correct
florida
is
the
only
or
almost
the
only
jurisdiction
that
has
ever
permitted
this
sort
of
thing.
so
there
is
no
significance
to
this
case
whatsoever.
however,
the
real
issue
in
this
case
is
not
the
issue
that
the
appellants
have
presented
and
the
reason
it
is
not
the
issue
that
they
have
presented
is
that
they
have
attempted
to
court
the
label
of
commercial
business
on
an
activity
of
the
church
which
while
it
has
certain
commercial
dimensions
is
a
little
much
more
limited
character
and
one
recognized
by
all
american
jurisdictions
as
being
something
that
is
different
from
pure
commercial
activity.
and
in
this
stipulation
of
facts
which
is
contained
which
is
reprinted
as
an
appendix
to
the
motion
to
dismiss
or
affirm,
we
have
the
following
stipulated
facts
between
the
parties
on
page
three
of
the
appendix.
stipulation
--
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
it
is
in
the
motion
to
dismiss
or
affirm.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
on
page
three
we
have
stipulation
that
all
of
this
church
property
is
being
used
for
church
purposes.
on
page
four,
a
stipulation
of
the
use
of
part
of
the
parking
area
during
the
week
by
church
members.
on
page
five
particularly,
we
have
a
key
stipulation
on
the
paragraph
at
the
top
of
the
page.
but
the
church
is
located
in
the
heart
of
a
great
metropolitan
area
and
is
required
to
maintain
the
parking
area
for
the
use
of
the
congregation
and
so
forth.
then
a
part
of
this
part
of
this
parking
space,
which
is
in
the
middle,
it
is
used
every
day
of
the
week
by
people
attending
church
and
church
functions
but
rather
than
permit
that
portion
not
for
use
to
lie
vacant
the
church
rents
the
parking
area.
the
church
does
directly
operate
this
parking
area.
there
is
no
intervening
less
so.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
that
may
be
so,
your
honor.
it
depends
on
the
regulations
that
will
be
promulgated
in
interpreting
that
50%.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
yes.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
it
is
depending
what
the
church
itself
does
depending
on
the
regulation
say,
what
the
church
does.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
well,
yes.
there
are
questions
that
is
still
has
to
be
answered
about
the
new
statute.
that
is
clear.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
yes
it
could
your
honor.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
that
is
certainly
its
intention.
its
intention
is
to
say
that
from
now
on
we
are
not
going
to
follow
the
75%
rule.
florida
has
the
statute
as
a
set
up
in
the
brief
where
in
any
charitable
non-profit
organization
could
rent
out
up
to
75%
of
its
home
facility.
the
basic
facilities
necessary
for
the
operation,
the
exempt
on
--
on
operations
of
that
organization
and
they
could
take
the
rental
and
use
t
he
rental
income
for
exempt
purposes.
florida
has
now
said,
we
are
not
going
to
do
that
anymore.
if
you
do
not
use
at
least
50%
of
the
facility
for
exempt
purposes
then
you
have
to
pay
a
hundred
percent
of
the
tax.
if
you
use
it
50
--
more
than
50%
then
we
will
apportion
the
tax
according
to
the
amount
of
the
property
that
is
used
for
non-exempt
purposes.
so
in
this
particular
case
the
application
that
will
actually
be
made
of
new
statute
to
the
parking
lot
will
depend
on
how
that
50%
is
figured
and
on
what
use
the
church
makes
next
year.
january
1st
is
the
status
date
in
florida
so
the
used
that
is
made
of
that
church
parking
area
on
january
1st
will
determine
the
--
the
one
of
the
principal
determinants
of
the
application
of
the
new
statute.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
then
it
would
have
to
pay
tax
in
49%.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
but
the
state
may
take
in
the
position
that
if
the
area
to
be
measured
is
strictly
the
parking
area
and
not
all
the
property
owned.
and
that
if
more
than
51%
of
the
parking
area
is
rented
than
the
taxes
have
to
be
paid
on
the
entire
parking
area
and
we
just
do
not
know
what
position
the
county
commissioner
of
the
state
will
take
on
that
question.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
they
would
have
to
pay
tax
on
the
49%
that
they
rent
out.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
it
does
not
require
a
license
according
to
my
information,
your
honor.
now
finally
there
is
a
stipulation
on
page
12
of
the
appendix
that
this
parking
lot
is
as
necessary
to
the
church
as
the
roof.
so
there
can
be
no
question
but
that
in
this
case
we
are
talking
about
an
income
that
incidentally,
income
producing
use
of
a
facility
that
is
absolutely
indispensible
for
the
conduct
of
the
exempt
operations
and
functions
of
this
church.
and
that
is
why
the
issue
in
this
case
simply
cannot
be
the
issue
that
the
appellants
have
attempted
to
raise.
the
broad
issue
of
how
far
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
would
prevent
the
states
of
the
federal
government
from
granting
an
exemption
like
the
exemption
that
used
to
exist
in
the
internal
revenue
code
before
the
tax
reform
act
of
1969.
that
exemption,
the
exemption
of
churches
and
certain
other
types
of
exempt
to
organizations
from
the
tax
on
unrelated
business
income
is
the
exemption
that
appellants
seem
to
be
attacking
but
that
exemption
does
not
exist
either
except
to
the
extent
that
there
is
a
type
of
five
year
flaws
in
which
the
organizations
that
used
to
enjoy
that
exemption
before
1969
or
given
a
grace
period
in
which
to
dispose
of
the
property
or
start
paying
the
full
tax.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
well,
the
parking
lot
was
originally
not
a
part
of
the
church
it
was
purchased
at
--
mostly
after
the
second
world
war
to
make
it
possible
for
the
people
to
get
to
church
as
that
area
developed
commercially
and
you
know,
became
quite
congested
with
automobiles
when
they
became
available
again
after
the
war
and
gasoline
was
more
available.
then
it
was
necessary
to
secure
this
property
otherwise
--
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
well,
in
this
particular
days
--
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
well,
i
have
not
pushed
it
beyond
what
appellants
have
stipulated
and
what
the
supreme
court
of
florida
found
and
what
the
district
court
in
this
case
also
presume.
so
as
a
state
of
question
here
is
simply
not
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
an
exemption
that
would
be
granted
to
some
totally
commercial
operation
of
a
church.
the
real
issues
in
this
case
as
we
see
them
are
rather
the
permissibility
of
parity
of
treatment
by
the
states
of
the
federal
government
of
churches
with
charitable
non-profit
organizations.
that
is
the
only
question
that
is
before
this
court
because
florida
did
not
give
any
special
treatment
to
churches
in
this
case.
florida
treated
churches
the
same
way
that
it
treated
charitable
non-profit
organizations
in
general.
but
there
is
nothing
specific.
there
is
no
preference
here
in
favor
of
a
church.
florida
treated
the
church
in
the
same
method
just
as
new
york
in
the
walz
case
treated
churches
the
same
way
it
treated
other
types
of
exempt
organizations.
what
appellants
are
really
asking
in
this
court
to
say
is
that
churches
has
to
be
singled
out.
they
have
to
be
singled
out
in
tax.
they
cannot
be
included
in
this
general
class
of
charitable
non-profit
organization.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
no,
it
would
not.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
it
would
not
be
exempted.
it
has
got
to
be
used
at
least
25%
or
had
to
be
used
at
least
25%
of
the
time.
its
park,
one
of
the
home
facility.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
so
it
is
completely
separate
and
it
is
not
used
for
the
exempt
purposes.
it
simply
is
not
exempt.
then
i
would
draw
the
attention
of
the
court
to
--
with
typical
structure
of
an
american
charitable
non
profit
organizations,
then
think
of
any
college
or
university
of
any
hospital
of
any
orphanage
of
good
size.
most
of
these
organizations
have
in
addition
to
the
basic
facilities
that
they
are
using,
other
facilities
which
are
also
important
and
necessary
but
which
are
open
to
the
public
in
many
cases
and
for
which
a
charge
is
made.
the
hospital
cafeteria,
the
hospital
parking
lot,
the
auditorium
in
a
college,
it
has
never
been
a
rule
of
american
taw
law
that
the
only
way
of
charitable
non-profit
organization
or
a
church
can
support
itself
is
by
free
will
offerings
that
are
sufficient
every
year
for
its
budget.
every
church
there
and
every
state
in
the
union
and
here
in
the
district
of
columbia,
churches
and
non-profit
charitable
organizations
have
been
allowed
to
engage
in
fund
raising
activities
of
various
types
of
a
more
or
less
commercial
character
without
losing
the
property
tax
exemption.
now
florida,
it
is
true
has
adopted
a
rule
that
is
somewhat
different
in
most
states
so
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
discover,
if
the
property
is
rented
that
is
the
end
of
the
matter.
but
florida
permitted
for
a
time,
75%
rental
without
loss
of
the
property
tax
exemptions.
but
there
is
not
any
constitutional
difference
between
this
kind
of
permission
for
use,
income
producing
use
of
the
basic
home
facility
and
the
permission
that
has
been
granted
for
such
matters
as
dances
and
dinners
and
picnics
and
bazaars
of
all
kind.
the
rule
has
been
in
every
american
jurisdiction
that
non
--
that
exempt
organizations
have
to
be
non-profit.
it
has
never
been
if
they
have
to
be
non-productive
but
they
have
to
be
completely
dependent
upon
the
free
will
offerings
of
the
public
as
a
method
of
financing
themselves.
now,
there
have
been
in
our
history
certain
efforts
now
and
then
to
change
this
rule
and
to
require
particularly
the
churches
to
be
dependent
on
free
will
offerings
may
each
year
and
only
on
those
offering.
but
no
jurisdiction
has
ever
adopted
that
particular
rule
of
law.
in
this
morning’s
paper
we
read
of
the
johnson
foundation
where
a
billion
dollars
has
been
donated
for
the
charitable
purposes
of
that
foundation.
and
of
this
initial
gift
will
be
administered
by
the
foundation
in
conformity
with
walz
and
the
income
from
that
capital
gift
will
finance
many
of
the
activities
of
the
foundation.
our
law
permits
the
creation
of
such
activities
and
entities
and
has
always
done
so.
i
think
that
there
is
still
another
matter
which
is
of
extreme
importance
in
this
case
and
that
is
the
attack
by
the
appellants
on
the
doctrine
of
legislative
discretion
in
the
tax
area.
this
doctrine
as
been
expressed
by
this
court
on
many
occasions,
notably
in
the
bell's
gap
railroad
against
pennsylvania
case
and
in
--
it
was
also
in
the
gibbons
against
district
of
columbia
case,
it
was
also
mentioned
in
the
walz
case
that
the
legislature
is
in
frozen
into
every
particle
of
the
tax
orders.
there
is
an
ample
opportunity
for
the
exercise
of
a
choice.
a
constitution
extrudes
that
is
some
moments
there
are
specific
limitations
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
the
taxing
power
most
of
congress
and
of
the
states.
but
in
the
absence
of
a
specific
prohibition,
clear
prohibition,
this
court
has
been
correctly
totally
reluctant
to
imply
limitations
on
the
exercise
on
the
taxing
power.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
i
--
(inaudible)
in
personal
property.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
i
do
not
know
your
honor.
i
do
simply
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
oh,
there
would
not
be
a
problem
in
that
area.
i
--
my
only
information
is
that
it
generally
speaking
in
american
tax
laws
such
securities
have
not
been
subject
to
the
personal
property
tax.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
yes,
and
in
the
pennsylvania
case,
the
bell's
gap
case
in
which
this
court
asserted
the
authority
of
the
states
to
exercise
a
sample
of
discretion.
that
was
a
security’s
facts
case
too.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
no
it
is
not
your
honor
because
the
definition
of
an
unrelated
business
excludes
rentals,
not
churches
anymore.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
rentals.
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
no,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
not
that
i
know.
so
the
parental
problem
and
say
the
unrelated
business
income
problem
here
is
that
the
debt
or
the
answer
to
it
simply
that
the
federal
statute
excludes
from
the
definitions
of
an
unrelated
business
income
derived
from
interests
from
dividends,
from
rentals
and
from
royalties.
but
let
us
consider
for
moment
the
choice
that
the
state
faces
in
this
area
of
taxation
and
exemption.
it
has
only
two
choices,
one,
to
tax
or
other
not
to
tax.
appellants
assert
that
not
taxing
helps.
if
they
are
correct
in
that
contention
despite
of
the
language
of
the
walz
case
which
rejects
that
concept
that
an
exemption
involved
sponsorship
for
active
assistance,
but
if
they
are
correct
in
saying
that
an
exemption
helps
than
extends
the
reason
that
taxation
purpose
and
the
doctrine
of
the
everson
case
and
of
the
subsequent
explanations
and
elaborations
of
that
case
is
not
that
the
government
cannot
aid
the
churches.
it
is
that
the
government
cannot
neither
help
nor
hurt
certainly
not
on
purpose
and
neither
help
nor
hurt.
and
in
the
phase
of
this
mandate
of
the
first
amendment,
what
is
the
government
to
do
when
it
cannot
avoid
one
or
the
other?
no
i
think
this
is
a
false
dilemma.
i
think
that
the
walz
opinion
quite
correctly
rejected
the
concept
that
the
exemption
amounted
to
positive
sponsorship
of
a
church
or
direct
active
assistance
to
the
church.
what
the
government
has
faced
with
the
legislatures
faced
with
here
is
four
types
of
organizations,
governmental
organizations,
private
for
profit
organizations,
charitable
non
profit
organizations
and
churches
and
religious
organizations.
now
in
the
choice
between
taxing
and
not
taxing
when
it
comes
to
the
governmental
organization,
the
government
is
certainly
not
going
to
tax
unless
it
engages
in
some
budget
bookkeeping,
a
shifting
of
the
burden
–
of
--
of
long
different
elements
of
the
government.
with
the
private
for
a
profit
organizations,
the
federal
government,
the
federal
government
and
the
states
have
elected
to
tax
and
when
the
charitable
non-profit
organizations,
the
federal
government
and
the
state
governments
have
elected
not
to
tax.
now
when
the
come
to
the
churches
and
the
religious
organizations
which
of
this
three
categories
are
churches
and
to
religious
organizations
which
of
these
three
categories
are
churches
most
like,
well,
they
are
certainly
not
governmental
organizations
and
there
is
certainly
not
drive
organizations
under
the
legal
concept
of
a
private
for
profit
organizations
because
of
they
were,
they
would
not
qualify
under
the
legal
concept
of
a
church.
so
they
are
much
more
similar
to
a
charitable
non-profit
organizations
than
to
anything
else.
and
in
view
of
the
facts
that
many
of
churches
do
engage
in
charitable
activities
in
addition
to
the
basic
worship
and
preaching
that
they
do
it
is
eminently
sensible
for
a
legislature
to
treat
churches
and
religious
organizations
in
the
same
way
that
it
treats
charitable
non-profit
organizations.
but
there
is
more
to
this
than
just
reasonable
mess
because
our
historical
tradition
shows
that
this
is
the
choice
that
all
of
the
states
and
the
federal
government
have
in
fact
made.
and
if
we
have
any
reverence
for
the
choices
of
our
ancestors,
it
seems
to
me
we
ought
particularly
to
reverence
those
that
they
not
only
practice
but
they
profess
as
being
the
right
solution.
as
far
as
the
entanglement
question
is
concerned.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
entirely
spurious
in
this
particular
case.
there
has
been
no
evidence
whatsoever
of
that
entanglement
and
there
is
no
meaning
for
it
under
this
kind
of
--
it
is
the
only
statute
involved
in
this
case
which
permits
the
organization
to
do,
to
engage
in
this
type
of
renting.
as
far
as
policing,
the
income
is
concerned.
again
that
is
a
spurious
claim
because
in
order
for
you
qualify
initially
as
a
church
the
state
has
to
be
entitled,
you
know,
and
to
review
that,
has
to
be
entitled
to
make
at
least
simple
external
tests
of
the
uses
to
which
the
property
and
income
of
that
organization
is
put.
so
we
cannot
have
tax
exemptions
of
any
kind
and
we
could
not
have
taxation
of
any
kind
either
if
the
entanglement
doctrine
were
pushed
to
the
point
where
the
state
could
not
engage
in
simple
external
auditing
at
definite
periods
of
time.
the
last
reason
that
would
really
justify
and
increases
the
justification
for
this
choice,
of
the
all
the
states
is
that
if
they
were
to
single
out
churches
as
of
special
class
of
churches
would
as
a
practical
matter
simply
restructure
their
legal
entities
for
a
holdings
their
charitable
non-profit
activities.
in
other
words
if
the
doctrine
were
that
the
church
could
not
be
exempted
with
respects
to
this
traditional
income
producing
activities
of
home
facility.
then
the
churches
would
spin
off
all
their
other
activities
into
other
types
of
corporations.
and
this
seems
to
be
an
absolutely
useless
time
of
gesture
to
force
the
churches
to
make.
now
if
the
church,
pull
itself
down
to
where
it
is
simply
conducting
a
house
of
worship
then
walz
is
absolute
authority
for
the
exemptability
from
the
property
tax
of
the
house
of
worship.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
well,
(inaudible)
could
do
that
of
course
of
corporation
that
it
sold
it
to
would
have
to
pay
the
property
tax
and
the
income
tax.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
if
the
taxes
--
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
sure.
they
have
every
right
to
do
that.
well,
i
think
in
conclusion
i
can
sum
it
up
this
way.
the
appellants
are
asking
this
court
to
decide
a
question
that
is
not
presented
by
this
case.
they
are
asking
the
court
to
decide
a
question
to
the
extent
that
they
are
asking
this
court
to
decide
the
question
that
is
presented,
the
case
is
moot.
but
if
any
reason,
the
court
should
decide
that
the
questions
presented
by
this
case
is
not
moot
then
the
only
answer
that
the
court
can
give
to
the
question
which
is
simply
the
constitutional
permissibility
of
parity
of
treatment
with
respect
to
the
home
facilities
is
that
that
parity
of
treatment
is
permissible
because
that
is
the
only
answer
that
is
consistent
with
the
state
and
the
federal
tax
history
with
religious
neutrality
and
with
the
preservation
of
legislative
discretion.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court?
the
tax
exemption
that
is
involved
in
this
case
is
possibly
singular
in
the
history
of
american
tax
law
but
it
is
certainly
extinct.
the
statute
has
been
changed.
this
particular
tax
exemption
will
not
be
available
after
the
end
of
this
year
and
this
year’s
tax
year
is
already
closed.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
well
it
begins
in
january
and
by
the
first
monday
on
october,
if
the
roles
are
furnished
and
nothing
more
can
be
done.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
no.
but
it
is
in
the
statute
that
governs
the
assessments.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
oh,
no.
under
florida
law
where
there
has
been
simple
inadvertence
or
even
positive
neglect,
back
taxes
can
be
assessed
for
a
period
of
three
years.
that
is
clear
from
the
terms
of
the
statute
and
from
the
construction
of
that
statute
in
city
of
naples
against
convoy,
however,
where
the
taxing
authority
has
positively
and
affirmatively
treated
the
property
as
exempt
as
it
has
in
this
case
since
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
then
the
taxing
authority
cannot
change
its
position
after
the
roles
have
been
endorsed
on
the
first
embank
october.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
yes.
this
is
a
general
role.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
(voice
overlap)
foreclosing
the
assessment.
for
all
tax
--
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
now
it
is
true
that
in
the
city
of
naples
case
that
the
florida
supreme
court
allowed
the
taxpayers
who
were
the
plaintiffs
in
that
suit
and
who
were
trying
to
compel
the
city
of
naples
to
disregard
a
contract
that
entered
into
for
an
exemption
for
a
real
estate
development.
it
is
true
that
the
supreme
court
of
florida
said
that
while
the
city
could
not
be
compelled
to
collect
taxes
for
the
three
years
prior
to
the
commencement
of
the
litigation
that
they
could
collect
taxes
for
the
years
during
which
the
litigation
proceeded.
so
in
so
far
as
the
plaintiffs
make
the
contention
that
at
least
the
current
year’s
tax
is
still
at
issue
at
least
that
much
because
a
court
order
could
change
the
roles.
my
answer
to
that
is
that
the
doctrine
of
equitable
stopple
as
it
has
been
applied
in
the
coppock
case
and
the
city
of
naples
case
would
clearly
result
in
a
decision
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida
that
these
--
the
tax
commissioner
here
cannot
change
their
minds.
we
are
the
ones
who
relied
on
the
supreme
court
of
florida’s
decision
in
the
suit
brought
some
years
ago
by
the
accounting.
so
we
have
had
the
assurance
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
that
we
meet.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
yes
it
is.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
that
is
my
contention
your
honor.
and
it
seems
clear
to
me
that
the
law
of
florida
is
quite
clear
on
this
point.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
yes
your
honor.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
yes,
however
if
the
statute,
the
old
statute
were
still
on
the
books
then
it
would
seem
me
the
--
at
least
the
question
of
the
old
statute
would
still
be
around
but
it
is
not
a
round.
and
if
the
plaintiff,
the
appellants
are
correct
which
i
do
not
concede
but
they
are
correct
in
saying
that
florida
is
really
out
of
the
line
of
america
tax
tradition,
you
know
with
this
type
of
statute
and
then
it
goes
in
the
teeth
of
the
whole
history
as
anglo-american
tax
law
then
clearly
this
case
becomes
totally
insignificant.
the
statute
no
longer
exists
and
if
they
correct
florida
is
the
only
or
almost
the
only
jurisdiction
that
has
ever
permitted
this
sort
of
thing.
so
there
is
no
significance
to
this
case
whatsoever.
however,
the
real
issue
in
this
case
is
not
the
issue
that
the
appellants
have
presented
and
the
reason
it
is
not
the
issue
that
they
have
presented
is
that
they
have
attempted
to
court
the
label
of
commercial
business
on
an
activity
of
the
church
which
while
it
has
certain
commercial
dimensions
is
a
little
much
more
limited
character
and
one
recognized
by
all
american
jurisdictions
as
being
something
that
is
different
from
pure
commercial
activity.
and
in
this
stipulation
of
facts
which
is
contained
which
is
reprinted
as
an
appendix
to
the
motion
to
dismiss
or
affirm,
we
have
the
following
stipulated
facts
between
the
parties
on
page
three
of
the
appendix.
stipulation
--
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
it
is
in
the
motion
to
dismiss
or
affirm.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
on
page
three
we
have
stipulation
that
all
of
this
church
property
is
being
used
for
church
purposes.
on
page
four,
a
stipulation
of
the
use
of
part
of
the
parking
area
during
the
week
by
church
members.
on
page
five
particularly,
we
have
a
key
stipulation
on
the
paragraph
at
the
top
of
the
page.
but
the
church
is
located
in
the
heart
of
a
great
metropolitan
area
and
is
required
to
maintain
the
parking
area
for
the
use
of
the
congregation
and
so
forth.
then
a
part
of
this
part
of
this
parking
space,
which
is
in
the
middle,
it
is
used
every
day
of
the
week
by
people
attending
church
and
church
functions
but
rather
than
permit
that
portion
not
for
use
to
lie
vacant
the
church
rents
the
parking
area.
the
church
does
directly
operate
this
parking
area.
there
is
no
intervening
less
so.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
that
may
be
so,
your
honor.
it
depends
on
the
regulations
that
will
be
promulgated
in
interpreting
that
50%.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
yes.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
it
is
depending
what
the
church
itself
does
depending
on
the
regulation
say,
what
the
church
does.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
well,
yes.
there
are
questions
that
is
still
has
to
be
answered
about
the
new
statute.
that
is
clear.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
yes
it
could
your
honor.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
that
is
certainly
its
intention.
its
intention
is
to
say
that
from
now
on
we
are
not
going
to
follow
the
75%
rule.
florida
has
the
statute
as
a
set
up
in
the
brief
where
in
any
charitable
non-profit
organization
could
rent
out
up
to
75%
of
its
home
facility.
the
basic
facilities
necessary
for
the
operation,
the
exempt
on
--
on
operations
of
that
organization
and
they
could
take
the
rental
and
use
t
he
rental
income
for
exempt
purposes.
florida
has
now
said,
we
are
not
going
to
do
that
anymore.
if
you
do
not
use
at
least
50%
of
the
facility
for
exempt
purposes
then
you
have
to
pay
a
hundred
percent
of
the
tax.
if
you
use
it
50
--
more
than
50%
then
we
will
apportion
the
tax
according
to
the
amount
of
the
property
that
is
used
for
non-exempt
purposes.
so
in
this
particular
case
the
application
that
will
actually
be
made
of
new
statute
to
the
parking
lot
will
depend
on
how
that
50%
is
figured
and
on
what
use
the
church
makes
next
year.
january
1st
is
the
status
date
in
florida
so
the
used
that
is
made
of
that
church
parking
area
on
january
1st
will
determine
the
--
the
one
of
the
principal
determinants
of
the
application
of
the
new
statute.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
then
it
would
have
to
pay
tax
in
49%.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
but
the
state
may
take
in
the
position
that
if
the
area
to
be
measured
is
strictly
the
parking
area
and
not
all
the
property
owned.
and
that
if
more
than
51%
of
the
parking
area
is
rented
than
the
taxes
have
to
be
paid
on
the
entire
parking
area
and
we
just
do
not
know
what
position
the
county
commissioner
of
the
state
will
take
on
that
question.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
they
would
have
to
pay
tax
on
the
49%
that
they
rent
out.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
it
does
not
require
a
license
according
to
my
information,
your
honor.
now
finally
there
is
a
stipulation
on
page
12
of
the
appendix
that
this
parking
lot
is
as
necessary
to
the
church
as
the
roof.
so
there
can
be
no
question
but
that
in
this
case
we
are
talking
about
an
income
that
incidentally,
income
producing
use
of
a
facility
that
is
absolutely
indispensible
for
the
conduct
of
the
exempt
operations
and
functions
of
this
church.
and
that
is
why
the
issue
in
this
case
simply
cannot
be
the
issue
that
the
appellants
have
attempted
to
raise.
the
broad
issue
of
how
far
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
would
prevent
the
states
of
the
federal
government
from
granting
an
exemption
like
the
exemption
that
used
to
exist
in
the
internal
revenue
code
before
the
tax
reform
act
of
1969.
that
exemption,
the
exemption
of
churches
and
certain
other
types
of
exempt
to
organizations
from
the
tax
on
unrelated
business
income
is
the
exemption
that
appellants
seem
to
be
attacking
but
that
exemption
does
not
exist
either
except
to
the
extent
that
there
is
a
type
of
five
year
flaws
in
which
the
organizations
that
used
to
enjoy
that
exemption
before
1969
or
given
a
grace
period
in
which
to
dispose
of
the
property
or
start
paying
the
full
tax.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
well,
the
parking
lot
was
originally
not
a
part
of
the
church
it
was
purchased
at
--
mostly
after
the
second
world
war
to
make
it
possible
for
the
people
to
get
to
church
as
that
area
developed
commercially
and
you
know,
became
quite
congested
with
automobiles
when
they
became
available
again
after
the
war
and
gasoline
was
more
available.
then
it
was
necessary
to
secure
this
property
otherwise
--
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
well,
in
this
particular
days
--
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
well,
i
have
not
pushed
it
beyond
what
appellants
have
stipulated
and
what
the
supreme
court
of
florida
found
and
what
the
district
court
in
this
case
also
presume.
so
as
a
state
of
question
here
is
simply
not
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
an
exemption
that
would
be
granted
to
some
totally
commercial
operation
of
a
church.
the
real
issues
in
this
case
as
we
see
them
are
rather
the
permissibility
of
parity
of
treatment
by
the
states
of
the
federal
government
of
churches
with
charitable
non-profit
organizations.
that
is
the
only
question
that
is
before
this
court
because
florida
did
not
give
any
special
treatment
to
churches
in
this
case.
florida
treated
churches
the
same
way
that
it
treated
charitable
non-profit
organizations
in
general.
but
there
is
nothing
specific.
there
is
no
preference
here
in
favor
of
a
church.
florida
treated
the
church
in
the
same
method
just
as
new
york
in
the
walz
case
treated
churches
the
same
way
it
treated
other
types
of
exempt
organizations.
what
appellants
are
really
asking
in
this
court
to
say
is
that
churches
has
to
be
singled
out.
they
have
to
be
singled
out
in
tax.
they
cannot
be
included
in
this
general
class
of
charitable
non-profit
organization.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
no,
it
would
not.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
it
would
not
be
exempted.
it
has
got
to
be
used
at
least
25%
or
had
to
be
used
at
least
25%
of
the
time.
its
park,
one
of
the
home
facility.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
so
it
is
completely
separate
and
it
is
not
used
for
the
exempt
purposes.
it
simply
is
not
exempt.
then
i
would
draw
the
attention
of
the
court
to
--
with
typical
structure
of
an
american
charitable
non
profit
organizations,
then
think
of
any
college
or
university
of
any
hospital
of
any
orphanage
of
good
size.
most
of
these
organizations
have
in
addition
to
the
basic
facilities
that
they
are
using,
other
facilities
which
are
also
important
and
necessary
but
which
are
open
to
the
public
in
many
cases
and
for
which
a
charge
is
made.
the
hospital
cafeteria,
the
hospital
parking
lot,
the
auditorium
in
a
college,
it
has
never
been
a
rule
of
american
taw
law
that
the
only
way
of
charitable
non-profit
organization
or
a
church
can
support
itself
is
by
free
will
offerings
that
are
sufficient
every
year
for
its
budget.
every
church
there
and
every
state
in
the
union
and
here
in
the
district
of
columbia,
churches
and
non-profit
charitable
organizations
have
been
allowed
to
engage
in
fund
raising
activities
of
various
types
of
a
more
or
less
commercial
character
without
losing
the
property
tax
exemption.
now
florida,
it
is
true
has
adopted
a
rule
that
is
somewhat
different
in
most
states
so
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
discover,
if
the
property
is
rented
that
is
the
end
of
the
matter.
but
florida
permitted
for
a
time,
75%
rental
without
loss
of
the
property
tax
exemptions.
but
there
is
not
any
constitutional
difference
between
this
kind
of
permission
for
use,
income
producing
use
of
the
basic
home
facility
and
the
permission
that
has
been
granted
for
such
matters
as
dances
and
dinners
and
picnics
and
bazaars
of
all
kind.
the
rule
has
been
in
every
american
jurisdiction
that
non
--
that
exempt
organizations
have
to
be
non-profit.
it
has
never
been
if
they
have
to
be
non-productive
but
they
have
to
be
completely
dependent
upon
the
free
will
offerings
of
the
public
as
a
method
of
financing
themselves.
now,
there
have
been
in
our
history
certain
efforts
now
and
then
to
change
this
rule
and
to
require
particularly
the
churches
to
be
dependent
on
free
will
offerings
may
each
year
and
only
on
those
offering.
but
no
jurisdiction
has
ever
adopted
that
particular
rule
of
law.
in
this
morning’s
paper
we
read
of
the
johnson
foundation
where
a
billion
dollars
has
been
donated
for
the
charitable
purposes
of
that
foundation.
and
of
this
initial
gift
will
be
administered
by
the
foundation
in
conformity
with
walz
and
the
income
from
that
capital
gift
will
finance
many
of
the
activities
of
the
foundation.
our
law
permits
the
creation
of
such
activities
and
entities
and
has
always
done
so.
i
think
that
there
is
still
another
matter
which
is
of
extreme
importance
in
this
case
and
that
is
the
attack
by
the
appellants
on
the
doctrine
of
legislative
discretion
in
the
tax
area.
this
doctrine
as
been
expressed
by
this
court
on
many
occasions,
notably
in
the
bell's
gap
railroad
against
pennsylvania
case
and
in
--
it
was
also
in
the
gibbons
against
district
of
columbia
case,
it
was
also
mentioned
in
the
walz
case
that
the
legislature
is
in
frozen
into
every
particle
of
the
tax
orders.
there
is
an
ample
opportunity
for
the
exercise
of
a
choice.
a
constitution
extrudes
that
is
some
moments
there
are
specific
limitations
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
the
taxing
power
most
of
congress
and
of
the
states.
but
in
the
absence
of
a
specific
prohibition,
clear
prohibition,
this
court
has
been
correctly
totally
reluctant
to
imply
limitations
on
the
exercise
on
the
taxing
power.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
i
--
(inaudible)
in
personal
property.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
i
do
not
know
your
honor.
i
do
simply
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
oh,
there
would
not
be
a
problem
in
that
area.
i
--
my
only
information
is
that
it
generally
speaking
in
american
tax
laws
such
securities
have
not
been
subject
to
the
personal
property
tax.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
yes,
and
in
the
pennsylvania
case,
the
bell's
gap
case
in
which
this
court
asserted
the
authority
of
the
states
to
exercise
a
sample
of
discretion.
that
was
a
security’s
facts
case
too.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
no
it
is
not
your
honor
because
the
definition
of
an
unrelated
business
excludes
rentals,
not
churches
anymore.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
rentals.
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
no,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
not
that
i
know.
so
the
parental
problem
and
say
the
unrelated
business
income
problem
here
is
that
the
debt
or
the
answer
to
it
simply
that
the
federal
statute
excludes
from
the
definitions
of
an
unrelated
business
income
derived
from
interests
from
dividends,
from
rentals
and
from
royalties.
but
let
us
consider
for
moment
the
choice
that
the
state
faces
in
this
area
of
taxation
and
exemption.
it
has
only
two
choices,
one,
to
tax
or
other
not
to
tax.
appellants
assert
that
not
taxing
helps.
if
they
are
correct
in
that
contention
despite
of
the
language
of
the
walz
case
which
rejects
that
concept
that
an
exemption
involved
sponsorship
for
active
assistance,
but
if
they
are
correct
in
saying
that
an
exemption
helps
than
extends
the
reason
that
taxation
purpose
and
the
doctrine
of
the
everson
case
and
of
the
subsequent
explanations
and
elaborations
of
that
case
is
not
that
the
government
cannot
aid
the
churches.
it
is
that
the
government
cannot
neither
help
nor
hurt
certainly
not
on
purpose
and
neither
help
nor
hurt.
and
in
the
phase
of
this
mandate
of
the
first
amendment,
what
is
the
government
to
do
when
it
cannot
avoid
one
or
the
other?
no
i
think
this
is
a
false
dilemma.
i
think
that
the
walz
opinion
quite
correctly
rejected
the
concept
that
the
exemption
amounted
to
positive
sponsorship
of
a
church
or
direct
active
assistance
to
the
church.
what
the
government
has
faced
with
the
legislatures
faced
with
here
is
four
types
of
organizations,
governmental
organizations,
private
for
profit
organizations,
charitable
non
profit
organizations
and
churches
and
religious
organizations.
now
in
the
choice
between
taxing
and
not
taxing
when
it
comes
to
the
governmental
organization,
the
government
is
certainly
not
going
to
tax
unless
it
engages
in
some
budget
bookkeeping,
a
shifting
of
the
burden
–
of
--
of
long
different
elements
of
the
government.
with
the
private
for
a
profit
organizations,
the
federal
government,
the
federal
government
and
the
states
have
elected
to
tax
and
when
the
charitable
non-profit
organizations,
the
federal
government
and
the
state
governments
have
elected
not
to
tax.
now
when
the
come
to
the
churches
and
the
religious
organizations
which
of
this
three
categories
are
churches
and
to
religious
organizations
which
of
these
three
categories
are
churches
most
like,
well,
they
are
certainly
not
governmental
organizations
and
there
is
certainly
not
drive
organizations
under
the
legal
concept
of
a
private
for
profit
organizations
because
of
they
were,
they
would
not
qualify
under
the
legal
concept
of
a
church.
so
they
are
much
more
similar
to
a
charitable
non-profit
organizations
than
to
anything
else.
and
in
view
of
the
facts
that
many
of
churches
do
engage
in
charitable
activities
in
addition
to
the
basic
worship
and
preaching
that
they
do
it
is
eminently
sensible
for
a
legislature
to
treat
churches
and
religious
organizations
in
the
same
way
that
it
treats
charitable
non-profit
organizations.
but
there
is
more
to
this
than
just
reasonable
mess
because
our
historical
tradition
shows
that
this
is
the
choice
that
all
of
the
states
and
the
federal
government
have
in
fact
made.
and
if
we
have
any
reverence
for
the
choices
of
our
ancestors,
it
seems
to
me
we
ought
particularly
to
reverence
those
that
they
not
only
practice
but
they
profess
as
being
the
right
solution.
as
far
as
the
entanglement
question
is
concerned.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
entirely
spurious
in
this
particular
case.
there
has
been
no
evidence
whatsoever
of
that
entanglement
and
there
is
no
meaning
for
it
under
this
kind
of
--
it
is
the
only
statute
involved
in
this
case
which
permits
the
organization
to
do,
to
engage
in
this
type
of
renting.
as
far
as
policing,
the
income
is
concerned.
again
that
is
a
spurious
claim
because
in
order
for
you
qualify
initially
as
a
church
the
state
has
to
be
entitled,
you
know,
and
to
review
that,
has
to
be
entitled
to
make
at
least
simple
external
tests
of
the
uses
to
which
the
property
and
income
of
that
organization
is
put.
so
we
cannot
have
tax
exemptions
of
any
kind
and
we
could
not
have
taxation
of
any
kind
either
if
the
entanglement
doctrine
were
pushed
to
the
point
where
the
state
could
not
engage
in
simple
external
auditing
at
definite
periods
of
time.
the
last
reason
that
would
really
justify
and
increases
the
justification
for
this
choice,
of
the
all
the
states
is
that
if
they
were
to
single
out
churches
as
of
special
class
of
churches
would
as
a
practical
matter
simply
restructure
their
legal
entities
for
a
holdings
their
charitable
non-profit
activities.
in
other
words
if
the
doctrine
were
that
the
church
could
not
be
exempted
with
respects
to
this
traditional
income
producing
activities
of
home
facility.
then
the
churches
would
spin
off
all
their
other
activities
into
other
types
of
corporations.
and
this
seems
to
be
an
absolutely
useless
time
of
gesture
to
force
the
churches
to
make.
now
if
the
church,
pull
itself
down
to
where
it
is
simply
conducting
a
house
of
worship
then
walz
is
absolute
authority
for
the
exemptability
from
the
property
tax
of
the
house
of
worship.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
well,
(inaudible)
could
do
that
of
course
of
corporation
that
it
sold
it
to
would
have
to
pay
the
property
tax
and
the
income
tax.
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
if
the
taxes
--
mr.
charles
m.
whelan
sure.
they
have
every
right
to
do
that.
well,
i
think
in
conclusion
i
can
sum
it
up
this
way.
the
appellants
are
asking
this
court
to
decide
a
question
that
is
not
presented
by
this
case.
they
are
asking
the
court
to
decide
a
question
to
the
extent
that
they
are
asking
this
court
to
decide
the
question
that
is
presented,
the
case
is
moot.
but
if
any
reason,
the
court
should
decide
that
the
questions
presented
by
this
case
is
not
moot
then
the
only
answer
that
the
court
can
give
to
the
question
which
is
simply
the
constitutional
permissibility
of
parity
of
treatment
with
respect
to
the
home
facilities
is
that
that
parity
of
treatment
is
permissible
because
that
is
the
only
answer
that
is
consistent
with
the
state
and
the
federal
tax
history
with
religious
neutrality
and
with
the
preservation
of
legislative
discretion.
