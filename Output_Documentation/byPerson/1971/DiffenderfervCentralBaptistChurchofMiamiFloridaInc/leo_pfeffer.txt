mr.
leo
pfeffer
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
a
question
whether
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
forbid
government
of
tax
exemption
to
extent
to
church
owned
commercial
property.
the
specifics
of
the
case
involve
a
florida
statute
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
not
quite
--
i
have
addressed
myself
to
the
question
of
mootness
in
my
reply
brief
which
i
filed
in
this
court.
specifically
to
that
exclusive
issue
but
i
will
briefly
state
that
why
i
believe
this
case
is
not
moot.
the
first
case,
the
new
amendatory
law
is
not
yet
in
effect.
it
takes
effect
next
year,
december
31st
of
this
year
which
means
the
next
fiscal
year.
and
so
that
the
tax
for
this
year
at
very
least
is
before
the
court,
so
it
is
not
moot
at
least
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
for
this
year
because
the
statute
itself,
the
very
less
says
it
shall
not
take
effect
until
next
year.
so
you
will
find
that
in
the
suggestion.
you
will
find
that
on
the
very
last
page
15
of
the
suggestion
of
the
attorney
general,
the
state
of
florida
which
has
a
text
of
the
amendatory
statute,
actually
will
take
effect
december
31st,
1971
which
means
the
next
year
and
not
for
the
current
year.
so
that
--
it
is
a
very
minimum,
it
is
applicable.
there
is
also
a
florida
statute
which
says,
if
any
tax
which
is
not
collected
for
any
reason,
is
there
after
determined
to
be
payable,
the
taxpayer
is
liable
for
the
three
years
past
taxes.
so
that
on
the
very
technical
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes.
there
is,
right.
yes,
there
is,
it
is
contained
in
my
reply
brief.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
and
the
statute
itself
does
so
provide
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
i
do
not
think
so
for
a
different
reason.
i
think
that
under
the
decision
of
this
court
in
(inaudible),
a
determination
that
the
plaintiffs
here,
assume
this
taxpayer
is
planning
to
sue
means
that
they
have
been
individually
harmed
by
the
exemption
and
while
the
state
of
florida
can
if
it
wishes
to
provide
the
future
of
the
exemption.
at
least
as
far
as
the
tax
was
accrued,
while
this
suit
is
pending
at
the
very
least,
the
very
least,
the
plaintiff
by
his
factor,
he
has
standing,
has
the
pressure
to
agree
with
him
even
though
the
tax
is
never
collectible.
well,
the
tax
may
be
collectible,
presumably
within
the
power
of
this
court
as
a
court
of
equity.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
i
would
say
that
under
the
first
amendment,
the
plaintiffs
would
have
a
suit
in
the
court,
to
compel
them
to
pay
the
tax
as
a
redress
for
wront
that
he
committed,
an
equitable
cause
of
the
court.
in
any
event
the
issue,
it
is
collectible
as
i
indicated
that
the
issue
is
one
of
national
importance
or
else
the
court
would
not
have
noted
it.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
do
not
think
it
is
necessary
because
the
amendatory
statute
is
unambiguous,
it
says,
some
will
take
effect
until
next
year.
so
then
in
that
sense
i
do
not
think
it
was
--.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
not
think
so,
because
i
think
if
the
florida
court,
as
i
indicated
in
my
brief,
if
the
florida
court
would
say
that
the
tax
is
not
collectible
retroactively,
i
would
say
that
is
to
raise
a
federal
issue,
a
federal
question
whether
that
florida,
the
state
of
florida
can
deprive
a
taxpayer
of
that
equitable
remedy
anymore
than
to
deprive
him
a
right
to
sue
originally
because
it
is
a
federal
question
and
not
the
state
question.
now,
the
question
--
the
specifics
of
this
case
is
a
florida
statute
is
which
as
pointed
out
has
been
amended.
now
there
is
a
difference
between
myself
and
the
attorney
for
the
other
plaintiff.
we
do
not
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
the
amendatory
statute.
the
amendatory
statute
says,
when
a
piece
of
property
owned
by
a
church
is
used
partly
for
church
purposes
and
partly
for
non
commercial
purposes,
that
part
which
is
used,
that
should
be
prorate
tax
on
that
part
which
is
used
for
non
or
to
the
extent
that
is
used
for
commercial
purposes.
mr.
hollander
representing
the
plaintiff,
is
of
the
opinion
that
end
use
of
it
destroys
the
entire
exemption,
we
do
not
have
to
go
that
far.
we
concede,
at
least
for
the
purpose
of
this
case
that
to
the
extent
that
the
statute
prorates
the
taxability
to
that
extent,
it
is
constitutional.
now
the
question
presented
to
this
court
is
whether
this
court’s
decision
on
walz
which
upheld
the
exemptibility
of
property
owned
by
a
church
and
used
exclusively
for
religious
purposes
extends
to
property
which
is
used
for
in
least
,
in
part,
purely
in
the
secular
field
of
commercial
competition
enterprise.
the
sole
relationship
to
the
church
being
that
all
of
the
profits
of
it
go
to
the
church.
it
was
our
contention
that
nothing
in
the
walz
case
requires
its
extension
to
this
particular
case
and
the
issue
was
specifically
not
before
the
court
then.
in
walz
the
court
recognized
and
rejected
the
argument
there
presented
that
tax
exemption
represented
the
first
step
inevitable
progression,
the
court
said,
the
history
of
tax
exemption
for
200
years
shows
there
has
not
been
an
inevitable
progression
in
breaking
down
the
wall
of
separation
between
church
and
state.
if
your
honor
please,
this
case
shows
that
perhaps
the
court
was
a
little
too
optimistic
in
walz
because
this
is
a
further
step.
unlike
the
walz
situation,
this
does
not
have
the
support
of
200
years
of
uniform
universal
practice
about
which
the
court
both
in
the
court’s
opinion
and
congress'
opinion
relied
large
measure
in
walz.
it
showed
that
ever
since
our
constitution
was
written,
in
every
state,
the
union
including
the
federal
government,
land
used
exclusively
for
religious
purposes
was
exempt
and
the
court
pointed
out
and
this
congress'
opinion
pointed
out,
as
the
holmes
statement,
that
this
history
is
worth
volumes
of
logic
and
should
be
great
width.
the
history
here
is
just
the
reverse.
the
history
here
shows,
and
i
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
that
even
as
far
back
as
1217,
there
was
this
device
of
turning
all
the
property
to
a
religiously
owned
property
for
non-religious
use
as
a
means
of
avoiding
the
obligations
of
feudalism
and
what
today
would
be
the
functional
equivalent
of
taxation.
now,
it
is
our
contention
that
a
statute
which
exempts
a
church
from
those
burdens
which
every
secular
commercial
institution
bears
in
its
operation,
the
commercial
area
is
inevitably
a
statute
whose
purpose
or
certainly
its
effect,
whatever
its
purpose,
its
primary
effect
is
the
advancement
of
religion.
to
that
extent
it
is
subject
to
the
restrictions
of
the
first
amendment.
now
in
walz,
the
court
noted
aside
from
the
historical
background
of
tax
exemption
that
the
distinctive
state
would
be
an
alternative
though,
taxed
the
church
in
which
case,
there
will
have
to
be
some
entanglement
of
the
state
and
church
affairs
or
do
not
tax
it
in
which
case
the
entanglement
if
any
will
be
considerably
less.
and
the
rationale
of
the
court,
as
i
see
is,
if
you
ask
my
opinions
as
i
see
is
this,
that
prima
facie
at
the
very
least,
a
statute
by
the
state
which
advances
religion
or
aids
religion
is
prima
facie
subject
to
constitutional,
at
least
scrutiny,
strong
scrutiny,
and
it
is
only
if
you
can
show
as
was,
certain
in
walz
that
there
was
a
countervailing
factor
that
to
tax
would
impose
another
evil
which
the
first
amendment
was
sought
to
avoid,
the
evil
of
entanglement,
then
we
will
allow
the
exemption
rather
than
invoke
the
entanglement.
now
in
the
case
that
is
decided
since
we
wrote
the
brief
in
this
case,
the
lemon,
and
dicenso,
and
tilton
cases,
the
court
molded
that
the
walz
case
did
not
intend
and
it
did
not
expand
the
scope
of
governmental,
of
permissible
governmental
aids
religion
but
restricted
it.
and
the
court
noted,
particularly
in
tilton
which
involved
the
collegiate
and
the
court
held
that
that
part
of
the
federal
law
which
said
that
after
20
years,
a
college
which
receives
support
funds
to
build
a
facility
may
use
it
for
any
purpose.
that
part
of
it
the
court
unanimously,
there
was
no
court’s
opinion
in
tilton
that
was
(inaudible)
but
all
my
justices
agreed
that
to
that
extent
at
least
that
statute
was
unconstitutional,
there
was
some
value
which
existed
after
20
years
and
the
state
could
not
or
the
federal
government
could
not
aid
or
advance
religion
to
that
extent.
even
though
it
would
mean
continuing
surveillance
and
entanglement
after
20
years
because
the
statute,
the
(inaudible)
forbids
the
use
of
those
facilities
and
federal
funds
to
be
for
sectarian
teaching
or
religious
worship.
so
that
the
government
agents
after
20
years
would
still
have
to
keep
an
eye
on
that
facility
to
make
sure
it
was
not
used
for
religion.
thus
quite
clearly
indicating
although
there
seems
to
be
an
impression
which
i
do
not
believe
is
valid
that
the
eversen
rule
has
been
buried
that
government
may
aid
religion,
i
do
not
know
if
any
case
would
so
hold
but
it
is
quite
clear
that
tilton
and
lemon,
dicenso
do
not
allow
a
government
aid
to
religion
absent
of
some
countervailing
factor
such
as
in
walz
entanglement
in
everson,
the
welfare
of
children
were
protected
from
the
accidents
--
of
the
hazards
of
the
roads
and
that
type
of
case.
now,
and
our
contention
here
is
that
the
amount
of
entanglement
involved
in
financing
the
commercial
activities
of
a
religious
group
is
minimum
and
that
it
is
far
outweighed
by
the
other
factors
which
call
for
constitutional
restriction
upon
that
aid
or
benefit
to
religion.
one
of
the
things
which
we
believe
should
be
considered
by
the
court
which
the
court
noted
both
in
walz
and
in
lemon
and
dicenso,
that
one
of
the
things,
one
of
the
major
evils,
the
first
amendment
was
aimed
at
--
of
wordings,
was
that
the
court
“the
potential
for
political
divisiveness
along
religious
or
divisive
political
potential
that
the
fathers
of
the
first
amendment
were
afraid
and
they
had
a
whole
history
of
2,000
years
of
political
confidence
and
decisiveness,
because
of
religion
that
a
church
is
seeking
certain
benefits
and
the
church
in
return
is
seeking
to
control
the
statement
and
trying
to
control
the
church.
we
contend
that
this
type
of
legislation
which
puts
a
competitive
advantage
in
the
business
world
in
favor
of
churches
necessarily
bring
to
that
type
of
divisive
political
potential
which
this
court
wanted
to
get
both
in
walz
and
repeated
it
lemon
against
dicenso.
the
acrimony,
the
bitterness,
the
feelings
of
a
grudge
locks
on
there
and
across
the
street
from
downtown,
that
owned
by
the
church,
that
the
church
does
not
have
to
pay
a
tax
and
therefore
can
undercut
it
whereas
he
has
to
pay
a
tax.
that
kind
of
political
divisiveness,
that
kind
of
reaction
towards
a
favoritism
for
the
church
is
one
of
the
dangers
which
i
believe
the
first
amendment
was
intended
to
evoke.
now
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
oh,
yes
it
is,
mr.
chief
justice
because
the
--
the
municipality
is
not
the
state.
the
state
can
afford
it
by
simply
taxing
it.
the
point
is
that
it
does
not.
it
is
not
that
it
has
a
power
to,
the
point
is,
if
it
had
the
power
to,
it
would
simply
--
nobody
contends,
mr.
chief
justice
that
a
state
could
not
impose
such
a
tax.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
but
--
as
i
have
indicated
mr.
chief
justice
if
the
state
did
not
want
to
give
a
fair
advantage
to
the
church,
and
simply
do
it
--
simply
not
making
tax
exempt.
by
simply
not
--
by
not
making
--
i
do
not
believe
the
appellees
here
contend
that
there
was
a
constitutional
right
to
tax
exemption
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
believe
i
have
used
up
my
time,
if
possible
my
time
will
be
used
by
mr.
hollander,
the
attorney
for
the
other
appellant.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
a
question
whether
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
forbid
government
of
tax
exemption
to
extent
to
church
owned
commercial
property.
the
specifics
of
the
case
involve
a
florida
statute
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
not
quite
--
i
have
addressed
myself
to
the
question
of
mootness
in
my
reply
brief
which
i
filed
in
this
court.
specifically
to
that
exclusive
issue
but
i
will
briefly
state
that
why
i
believe
this
case
is
not
moot.
the
first
case,
the
new
amendatory
law
is
not
yet
in
effect.
it
takes
effect
next
year,
december
31st
of
this
year
which
means
the
next
fiscal
year.
and
so
that
the
tax
for
this
year
at
very
least
is
before
the
court,
so
it
is
not
moot
at
least
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
for
this
year
because
the
statute
itself,
the
very
less
says
it
shall
not
take
effect
until
next
year.
so
you
will
find
that
in
the
suggestion.
you
will
find
that
on
the
very
last
page
15
of
the
suggestion
of
the
attorney
general,
the
state
of
florida
which
has
a
text
of
the
amendatory
statute,
actually
will
take
effect
december
31st,
1971
which
means
the
next
year
and
not
for
the
current
year.
so
that
--
it
is
a
very
minimum,
it
is
applicable.
there
is
also
a
florida
statute
which
says,
if
any
tax
which
is
not
collected
for
any
reason,
is
there
after
determined
to
be
payable,
the
taxpayer
is
liable
for
the
three
years
past
taxes.
so
that
on
the
very
technical
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes.
there
is,
right.
yes,
there
is,
it
is
contained
in
my
reply
brief.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
and
the
statute
itself
does
so
provide
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
i
do
not
think
so
for
a
different
reason.
i
think
that
under
the
decision
of
this
court
in
(inaudible),
a
determination
that
the
plaintiffs
here,
assume
this
taxpayer
is
planning
to
sue
means
that
they
have
been
individually
harmed
by
the
exemption
and
while
the
state
of
florida
can
if
it
wishes
to
provide
the
future
of
the
exemption.
at
least
as
far
as
the
tax
was
accrued,
while
this
suit
is
pending
at
the
very
least,
the
very
least,
the
plaintiff
by
his
factor,
he
has
standing,
has
the
pressure
to
agree
with
him
even
though
the
tax
is
never
collectible.
well,
the
tax
may
be
collectible,
presumably
within
the
power
of
this
court
as
a
court
of
equity.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
i
would
say
that
under
the
first
amendment,
the
plaintiffs
would
have
a
suit
in
the
court,
to
compel
them
to
pay
the
tax
as
a
redress
for
wront
that
he
committed,
an
equitable
cause
of
the
court.
in
any
event
the
issue,
it
is
collectible
as
i
indicated
that
the
issue
is
one
of
national
importance
or
else
the
court
would
not
have
noted
it.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
do
not
think
it
is
necessary
because
the
amendatory
statute
is
unambiguous,
it
says,
some
will
take
effect
until
next
year.
so
then
in
that
sense
i
do
not
think
it
was
--.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
not
think
so,
because
i
think
if
the
florida
court,
as
i
indicated
in
my
brief,
if
the
florida
court
would
say
that
the
tax
is
not
collectible
retroactively,
i
would
say
that
is
to
raise
a
federal
issue,
a
federal
question
whether
that
florida,
the
state
of
florida
can
deprive
a
taxpayer
of
that
equitable
remedy
anymore
than
to
deprive
him
a
right
to
sue
originally
because
it
is
a
federal
question
and
not
the
state
question.
now,
the
question
--
the
specifics
of
this
case
is
a
florida
statute
is
which
as
pointed
out
has
been
amended.
now
there
is
a
difference
between
myself
and
the
attorney
for
the
other
plaintiff.
we
do
not
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
the
amendatory
statute.
the
amendatory
statute
says,
when
a
piece
of
property
owned
by
a
church
is
used
partly
for
church
purposes
and
partly
for
non
commercial
purposes,
that
part
which
is
used,
that
should
be
prorate
tax
on
that
part
which
is
used
for
non
or
to
the
extent
that
is
used
for
commercial
purposes.
mr.
hollander
representing
the
plaintiff,
is
of
the
opinion
that
end
use
of
it
destroys
the
entire
exemption,
we
do
not
have
to
go
that
far.
we
concede,
at
least
for
the
purpose
of
this
case
that
to
the
extent
that
the
statute
prorates
the
taxability
to
that
extent,
it
is
constitutional.
now
the
question
presented
to
this
court
is
whether
this
court’s
decision
on
walz
which
upheld
the
exemptibility
of
property
owned
by
a
church
and
used
exclusively
for
religious
purposes
extends
to
property
which
is
used
for
in
least
,
in
part,
purely
in
the
secular
field
of
commercial
competition
enterprise.
the
sole
relationship
to
the
church
being
that
all
of
the
profits
of
it
go
to
the
church.
it
was
our
contention
that
nothing
in
the
walz
case
requires
its
extension
to
this
particular
case
and
the
issue
was
specifically
not
before
the
court
then.
in
walz
the
court
recognized
and
rejected
the
argument
there
presented
that
tax
exemption
represented
the
first
step
inevitable
progression,
the
court
said,
the
history
of
tax
exemption
for
200
years
shows
there
has
not
been
an
inevitable
progression
in
breaking
down
the
wall
of
separation
between
church
and
state.
if
your
honor
please,
this
case
shows
that
perhaps
the
court
was
a
little
too
optimistic
in
walz
because
this
is
a
further
step.
unlike
the
walz
situation,
this
does
not
have
the
support
of
200
years
of
uniform
universal
practice
about
which
the
court
both
in
the
court’s
opinion
and
congress'
opinion
relied
large
measure
in
walz.
it
showed
that
ever
since
our
constitution
was
written,
in
every
state,
the
union
including
the
federal
government,
land
used
exclusively
for
religious
purposes
was
exempt
and
the
court
pointed
out
and
this
congress'
opinion
pointed
out,
as
the
holmes
statement,
that
this
history
is
worth
volumes
of
logic
and
should
be
great
width.
the
history
here
is
just
the
reverse.
the
history
here
shows,
and
i
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
that
even
as
far
back
as
1217,
there
was
this
device
of
turning
all
the
property
to
a
religiously
owned
property
for
non-religious
use
as
a
means
of
avoiding
the
obligations
of
feudalism
and
what
today
would
be
the
functional
equivalent
of
taxation.
now,
it
is
our
contention
that
a
statute
which
exempts
a
church
from
those
burdens
which
every
secular
commercial
institution
bears
in
its
operation,
the
commercial
area
is
inevitably
a
statute
whose
purpose
or
certainly
its
effect,
whatever
its
purpose,
its
primary
effect
is
the
advancement
of
religion.
to
that
extent
it
is
subject
to
the
restrictions
of
the
first
amendment.
now
in
walz,
the
court
noted
aside
from
the
historical
background
of
tax
exemption
that
the
distinctive
state
would
be
an
alternative
though,
taxed
the
church
in
which
case,
there
will
have
to
be
some
entanglement
of
the
state
and
church
affairs
or
do
not
tax
it
in
which
case
the
entanglement
if
any
will
be
considerably
less.
and
the
rationale
of
the
court,
as
i
see
is,
if
you
ask
my
opinions
as
i
see
is
this,
that
prima
facie
at
the
very
least,
a
statute
by
the
state
which
advances
religion
or
aids
religion
is
prima
facie
subject
to
constitutional,
at
least
scrutiny,
strong
scrutiny,
and
it
is
only
if
you
can
show
as
was,
certain
in
walz
that
there
was
a
countervailing
factor
that
to
tax
would
impose
another
evil
which
the
first
amendment
was
sought
to
avoid,
the
evil
of
entanglement,
then
we
will
allow
the
exemption
rather
than
invoke
the
entanglement.
now
in
the
case
that
is
decided
since
we
wrote
the
brief
in
this
case,
the
lemon,
and
dicenso,
and
tilton
cases,
the
court
molded
that
the
walz
case
did
not
intend
and
it
did
not
expand
the
scope
of
governmental,
of
permissible
governmental
aids
religion
but
restricted
it.
and
the
court
noted,
particularly
in
tilton
which
involved
the
collegiate
and
the
court
held
that
that
part
of
the
federal
law
which
said
that
after
20
years,
a
college
which
receives
support
funds
to
build
a
facility
may
use
it
for
any
purpose.
that
part
of
it
the
court
unanimously,
there
was
no
court’s
opinion
in
tilton
that
was
(inaudible)
but
all
my
justices
agreed
that
to
that
extent
at
least
that
statute
was
unconstitutional,
there
was
some
value
which
existed
after
20
years
and
the
state
could
not
or
the
federal
government
could
not
aid
or
advance
religion
to
that
extent.
even
though
it
would
mean
continuing
surveillance
and
entanglement
after
20
years
because
the
statute,
the
(inaudible)
forbids
the
use
of
those
facilities
and
federal
funds
to
be
for
sectarian
teaching
or
religious
worship.
so
that
the
government
agents
after
20
years
would
still
have
to
keep
an
eye
on
that
facility
to
make
sure
it
was
not
used
for
religion.
thus
quite
clearly
indicating
although
there
seems
to
be
an
impression
which
i
do
not
believe
is
valid
that
the
eversen
rule
has
been
buried
that
government
may
aid
religion,
i
do
not
know
if
any
case
would
so
hold
but
it
is
quite
clear
that
tilton
and
lemon,
dicenso
do
not
allow
a
government
aid
to
religion
absent
of
some
countervailing
factor
such
as
in
walz
entanglement
in
everson,
the
welfare
of
children
were
protected
from
the
accidents
--
of
the
hazards
of
the
roads
and
that
type
of
case.
now,
and
our
contention
here
is
that
the
amount
of
entanglement
involved
in
financing
the
commercial
activities
of
a
religious
group
is
minimum
and
that
it
is
far
outweighed
by
the
other
factors
which
call
for
constitutional
restriction
upon
that
aid
or
benefit
to
religion.
one
of
the
things
which
we
believe
should
be
considered
by
the
court
which
the
court
noted
both
in
walz
and
in
lemon
and
dicenso,
that
one
of
the
things,
one
of
the
major
evils,
the
first
amendment
was
aimed
at
--
of
wordings,
was
that
the
court
“the
potential
for
political
divisiveness
along
religious
or
divisive
political
potential
that
the
fathers
of
the
first
amendment
were
afraid
and
they
had
a
whole
history
of
2,000
years
of
political
confidence
and
decisiveness,
because
of
religion
that
a
church
is
seeking
certain
benefits
and
the
church
in
return
is
seeking
to
control
the
statement
and
trying
to
control
the
church.
we
contend
that
this
type
of
legislation
which
puts
a
competitive
advantage
in
the
business
world
in
favor
of
churches
necessarily
bring
to
that
type
of
divisive
political
potential
which
this
court
wanted
to
get
both
in
walz
and
repeated
it
lemon
against
dicenso.
the
acrimony,
the
bitterness,
the
feelings
of
a
grudge
locks
on
there
and
across
the
street
from
downtown,
that
owned
by
the
church,
that
the
church
does
not
have
to
pay
a
tax
and
therefore
can
undercut
it
whereas
he
has
to
pay
a
tax.
that
kind
of
political
divisiveness,
that
kind
of
reaction
towards
a
favoritism
for
the
church
is
one
of
the
dangers
which
i
believe
the
first
amendment
was
intended
to
evoke.
now
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
oh,
yes
it
is,
mr.
chief
justice
because
the
--
the
municipality
is
not
the
state.
the
state
can
afford
it
by
simply
taxing
it.
the
point
is
that
it
does
not.
it
is
not
that
it
has
a
power
to,
the
point
is,
if
it
had
the
power
to,
it
would
simply
--
nobody
contends,
mr.
chief
justice
that
a
state
could
not
impose
such
a
tax.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
but
--
as
i
have
indicated
mr.
chief
justice
if
the
state
did
not
want
to
give
a
fair
advantage
to
the
church,
and
simply
do
it
--
simply
not
making
tax
exempt.
by
simply
not
--
by
not
making
--
i
do
not
believe
the
appellees
here
contend
that
there
was
a
constitutional
right
to
tax
exemption
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
believe
i
have
used
up
my
time,
if
possible
my
time
will
be
used
by
mr.
hollander,
the
attorney
for
the
other
appellant.
