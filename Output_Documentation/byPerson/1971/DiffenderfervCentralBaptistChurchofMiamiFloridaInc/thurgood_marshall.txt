do
you
think
this
court
has
the
authority
to
tell
the
state
of
florida
that
they
must
collect
the
back
taxes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(voice

under
what
authority?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
for
how
many
years
back?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
could
not
we,
we
are
not
bound
by
that,
to
your
term,
we
could
go
back
20,
could
we
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
thus
how
far
do
you
go?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
specifically
what
they
have
or
would
that
be
mandamus
in
order
or
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
tell
me
who
has
the
authority
to
levy
the
taxes
involved?
justice
thurgood
marshall
dade
county
it
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
who
collects
those
to
your
party?
is
it
tax
collected
in
florida?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
the
tax
collector
a
party?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
i
know
they
have
done
this.
justice
thurgood
marshall
(voice
overlap)
and
did
you
ask
for
the
relieve
that
assessed
the
taxes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
why
did
you
consider
to
say
that
you
wanted
to
levy
the
back
taxes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
you
are
done
with
the
case
as
it
now
stands,
we
can
order
them
to
levy
the
taxes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
understand
that
you
have
(inaudible).
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
they
took
the
parking
area
and
the
church
reserved
51%
for
all
kinds
during
the
week
for
its
church
under

have
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
licensed,
the
parking
lot?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
whelan,
how
long
is
the
parking
lot
been
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
you
say
that
it
is
indispensable
to
rule
a
fund,
that
was
in
churches
without
parking
lots,
i
do
not
know
what
would
have
lost.
justice
thurgood
