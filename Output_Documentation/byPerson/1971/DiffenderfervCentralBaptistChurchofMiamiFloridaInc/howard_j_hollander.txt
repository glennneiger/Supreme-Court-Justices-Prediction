mr.
howard
j.
hollander
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
case
is
of
course
one
involving
the
separation
of
church
and
state
and
is
in
fact
a
progression
of
the
walz
decision
decided
last
year
by
this
court.
i
do
not
premise
my
thinking
on
this
case
on
the
everson
decision.
i
believe
that
my
position
in
this
is
case
would
be
squarely
met
with
the
dictates
of
not
only
walz
but
the
three
cases
decided
this
year,
dicenso,
tilton
and
lemon.
this
court
has
said
in
those
three
cases,
as
well
as
walz
that
there
are
three
main
evils
in
which
the
establishment
clause
attempted
to
prevent
and
that
was
financial
aid
sponsorship
and
active
involvement.
and
we
measured
those
three
evils
by
three
tests,
we
are
told.
and
the
tests
are
whether
or
not
there
is
a
valid
secular
legislative
purpose.
the
second
was
a
test
decided
in
the
dicenso
which
is
whether
or
not
the
primary
effect
either
inhibits
or
advances
the
religion.
and
the
third
test
is
whether
or
not
there
is
excessive
entanglement
or
active
involvement.\
i
think
that
the
case
before
you,
honors
is
clearly
was
not
involving
a
valid
secular
legislative
purpose
as
seen
in
the
walz
decision
where
there
was
discussion
in
the
court
opinion
concerning
the
pluralism
of
religions
and
the
good
works
of
religion.
certainly
that
is
not
involved
where
we
have
a
commercial
parking
lot
and
that
incidentally
is
exactly
what
it
is,
were
involved
with
a
square
block
in
the
city
of
miami
which
occupies
a
127,500
sq.
ft.
of
which
75,000
sq.
ft.
is
this
commercial
parking
lot,
monday
through
saturdays,
is
all
stipulation
of
fact
but
it
is
not
contested
facts.
we
are
up
here
on
stipulation
of
that,
monday
through
saturday,
each
and
everyday
other
than
sunday,
this
religious
institution
rents
out
this
lot
other
than
to
those
particular
lots
within
the
290
which
are
used
for
persons
who
might
want
to
attend
church
that
day
for
a
choir
meeting
or
a
directors
meeting
of
some
kind.
other
than
the
portion
which
might
be
used
for
someone
who
might
have
some
business,
monday
through
saturday
in
a
church,
the
entire
rest
of
this
lot,
75,000
sq.
ft.,
290
parking
spaces
is
rented
out
commercially
six
days
out
of
seven
days
a
week.
this
is
stipulation
of
fact.
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
oh,
yes!
drive
your
car
and
you
pay
your
rent
until
you
go
out.
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
right,
we
do
not
know
that
it
is
necessarily
owned
even
by
a
church.
it
is
just
the
regular
parking
lot
for
anyone
who
does
not
have
business
in
the
church.
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
are
they
church
employees?
i
really
do
not
know
that
sir.
i
do
not
know.
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
i
really
cannot
tell
you
that
sir.
i
do
not
know
whether
or
not
that
at
least
it
that
i
know
that
the
lots
are
used
commercially,
six
days
out
of
seven
days
a
week.
i
do
not
know
if
there
is
anyone
else
has
intervened
between
the
church
and
perhaps
--
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
i
do
not
think
it
covers
that
your
honor.
but
i
do
not
really
think
that
gets
at
the
issue,
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
in
my
judgment
the
primary
effect
of
renting
out
monday
through
saturday,
290
spaces
or
almost
all
of
that
or
the
active
involvement
of
the
government
is
such
as
to
transgress
the
restrictions
of
the
establishment
clause.
i
think
that
is
really
the
issue
involved
and
i
do
not
think
whether
not
the
institution
itself
or
a
corporation
which
the
institution
has
contracted
with
actually
runs
the
lot.
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
i
think
it
is
constitutional.
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
i
think
so
but
this
lot
is
--
that
is
not
case.
stipulation
of
facts
of
course
is
--
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
they
are,
the
appendix
was
dispensed,
what
they
are
as
part
of
the
record
and
they
are
quoted
incidentally
at
length
in
the
appellee’s
brief.
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
they
--
well
it
is
certainly
stipulations
of
facts
which
12
parties
entered
in
to.
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
i
do
not
think
that
those
facts
heard
at
all
in
issue.
i
do
think
that
we
have
some
very
important
things
to
decide
and
that
is
certainly
the
valid
leg
--
secular
legislative
purpose
is
not
there.
and
we
come
to
primary
effect
and
i
noted
the
language
in
tilton,
i
think
that
is
extremely
important
because
tilton
was
cited
on
the
bases
that
the
buildings
were
strictly
secular.
there
were
no
religious
symbols,
there
was
no
permeation
of
religion
on
a
higher
institutions.
it
was
strictly
secular
use.
so
the
court
was
concerned
with
the
use
of
these
facilities
or
what
is
the
use
of
this
facility?
six
days
out
of
seven
days
each
week
they
rent
out
this
parking
lot
and
they
take
in
a
profit
out
of
competitive
advantage
because
they
do
not
pay
taxes.
so
if
the
use
of
the
property
is
to
be
any
kind
of
criteria
as
apparently
it
was
not
the
tilton
decision
where
the
building
were
strictly
secular
and
the
court
dwelled
on
that
fact
and
certainly
the
use
of
this
property
commercially
with
cast
within
the
terms
of
the
establishment
clause.
and
certainly
also
within
the
terms
of
what
this
court
discussed
in
the
tilton
decision.
i
also
think
that
the
entanglement
that
we
get
involved
in
which
this
court
discussed
in
a
three
decision
this
year
and
the
walz
decision
last
year
is
present
in
this
case.
the
kind
of
political
divisiveness
which
this
court
says
if
not
inherent
in
our
people
is
certainly
involved
in
this
case
after
all
we
have
certain
court
that
attempted
to
tax.
we
have
a
supreme
court
of
florida
that
got
a
raised
at
the
circuit
court
in
reversed.
we
have
legislation
there
so
we
do
not
like
the
supreme
court
decisions
all
through
out
the
statutes
and
say
but
next
year
we
will
go
into
new
statutes.
we
have
a
raging
controversy
in
florida
over
this
lot.
and
a
very
political
divisiveness
which
this
court
seeks
to
prevent
is
exactly
what
we
have
with
the
commercial
parking
lot
in
miami.
now,
is
it
a
commercial
parking
lot
or
it
is
something
else?
the
district
court
down
there
said
it
was
commercial
parking
lot,
they
held
as
follows.
does
the
holding
in
walz
versus
tax
commissioner
supra
that
there
is
no
establishment
of
religion
and
no
inhibition
of
the
free
exercise
religion
in
a
state
taxation
scheme
which
exempts
from
taxation
property
use
“exclusively
for
religious
proposes”,
i.e.
religious
property
used
solely
for
religious
worship.
encompass
a
tax
exemption
in
the
instant
case
as
it
applies
to
church
property
used
as
a
commercial
parking
lot,
we
answer
affirmatively.
so
they
have
concluded
it
is
commercial
parking
lot.
but
why
have
they
decided
it
is
okay
a
novel
institution,
another
constitutional
principle.
they
said
because
the
proceeds
go
to
a
worthwhile
charitable
recipient
based
on
walz
and
the
court
based
their
decision
on
walz.
and
the
recipient,
we
are
going
to
hold
that
it
is
perfectly
alright
because
there
is
a
worthwhile
recipient
even
though
we
hold
it
a
commercial
parking
lot.
i
think
that
is
a
novel,
well
because
i
have
never
seen
any
establishment
case
really
that
looked
at
whether
or
not
that
worthwhile
recipient
was
such
as
to
permit
it
within
the
establishment
clause.
and
incidentally
the
very
kind
of
entanglement
is
inherent
in
that
kind
of
decision.
after
all,
the
sight
of
government
auditors,
government
inspectors
and
daily
surveillance
running
through
church
records
each
day
to
determine
where
the
funds
were
traced
to.
was
it
or
not
a
worthwhile
recipient?
that
is
the
very
kind
as
i
understand
it,
surveillance
which
this
court
says
is
not
proper
under
the
establishment
clause.
so
the
very
decision
of
the
us
district
court
calls
for
the
kind
of
surveillance
which
is
traced
the
funds
and
with
this
worthwhile,
fine,
it
is
not
worthwhile.
then
we
do
something
about
it.
now,
i
think
along
these
very
same
lines
and
counsel
and
i
may
have
difference
here.
i
think
we
do.
the
new
statute
which
is
going
to
go
into
effect
next
year
is
even
worse
than
this
one
because
the
new
statute
says,
well,
whether
we
will
break
it
off
at
50%
and
if
it
is
less
than
50%
we
will
prorate
it.
so
the
government
auditors
or
inspectors
for
daily
policing
of
going
through
the
records
of
the
church
of
this
290
spaces
and
it
was
like,
you
use
this
space
monday,
wednesday
and
friday
for
commercial
purposes.
use
this
space,
tuesday
and
thursday
for
religious
purposes
and
they
will
have
to
go,
how
many
spaces
were
used
for
religious
purposes?
how
many
for
commercial
purposes?
and
the
very
surveillance,
the
very
abhorrent
kind
of
degrading
situation
not
only
for
the
government
but
for
the
religious
institution
is
inherent
in
the
new
formula.
it
does
not
cure
it.
it
makes
it
worst,
the
new
statute.
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
we
are
at
odds.
i
think
that
the
new
statute
is
going
to
worst
in
the
old
statute
because
i
think
it
calls
for
greater
entanglement
even
in
the
old
one
does.
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
yes,
sir.
we
are
at
odds
on
that
point
and
i
wanted
to
practice
my
remarks
in
that
regard.
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
i
want
to
direct
my
remainder
of
the
marks,
the
mootness
issue
because
i
think
it
is
vicious
in
all
respect.
it
is
vicious
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all
let
us
get
to
the
back
taxing.
back
taxing
is
specifically
permitted
in
the
florida.
it
is
specifically
permitted
by
florida
statute
193.092
and
the
two
cases
cited
by
appellees
which
was
a
city
of
naples
case
in
the
blount
case
stand
for
the
proposition
that
back
taxing
is
permitted.
in
fact,
the
two
cases
say
so.
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
yes,
sir.
i
think
it
does.
because
i
think
it
is
a
matter
--
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
which
tells
us
that
--
the
establishment
of
religion
is
prohibited.
and
that
the
--
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
it
is
permitted
for
three
years
under
the
statute.
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
well,
perhaps
so.
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
well,
at
least
the
statute
permits
three
years.
in
fact
your
honor,
the
case
says,
are
these
the
very
case
cited
appellees
in
this
point,
case
says,
although
back
assessments
are
specifically
authorized
by
florida
statute.
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
well,
i
do
not
--
i
cannot
tell
the
court
what
procedure
to
use.
i
simply
think
that
--
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
the
county
authority,
the
taxing
authority
in
dade
county.
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
dade
county
is
the
defendant,
party
defendant
your
honor.
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
i
am
sorry
sir,
i
cannot
hear.
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
dade
county,
florida
is
a
party
to
this
suit
your
honor.
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
and
mr.
r.k.
overspeed
the
tax
collector
dade
county,
is
it
not?
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
this
has
been
implicit,
they
attempted
to
assess
the
taxes.
the
florida
supreme
court
said
it
cannot
do
it.
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
the
--
well,
my
complaint
calls
for
the
taxation
of
it.
perhaps
i
did
not
spell
it
out,
i
know
only
aobut
taxation
but
i
want
back
taxation
as
well
but
i
think
my
complaint
covers
exactly
what
we
are
looking
for.
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
oh,
yes,
sir.
i
have
no
question
about
it
because
i
think
the
case
is
in
florida
specifically
permitted.
i
call
your
honor
--
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
yes,
sir.
the
case
is
although
back
assessments
as
specifically
authorized
by
florida
statute
of
193.23,
f.s.a,
equitable
estoppel
present
the
city
in
this
case
where
good
faith
is
not
disputed.
that
case
happens
to
involve
where
the
city
is
--
certain
reliance
was
placed
upon
what
the
city
or
county
have
done.
so
they
said,
well,
in
this
case
you
cannot
do
it.
but
the
general
principal
in
the
statute
was
upheld.
they
did
the
same
thing
in
crockett
versys
lynch
(ph).
in
crockett
versys
lynch,
they
specifically
said,
however,
from
defendant
appellants
brief
and
we
took
--
we
determined
the
trial
of
trial
judge
concluded
that
the
back
assessments
involved
herein
were
specifically
authorized
by
statute
193.23,
florida
statutes.
we
agree
with
this
conclusion.
they
then
said
well
because
of
certain
reasons
in
this
case
we
feel
that
we
have
to
stop
taxing
authorities
because
the
more
--
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
but
not
stopple
against
to
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
it
was
a
stopple
against
the
taxing
authorities.
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
why
would
the
plaintiffs
who
never
mislead
or
never
intended
to
rely
on
anyone
--
never
gave
reliance
upon
this
people
possibly
be
stopped.
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
i
think
so,
and
i
think
--
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
that
is
right.
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
well,
the
county
never
gave
these
people
reliance
that
they
would
not
tax
--
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
well,
i
think
that
this
court
can
take
notice
of
the
florida
state
--
of
the
florida
cases
on
(voice
overlap).
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
that
is
a
--
i
think
that
if
your
honor
really
looks
at
this
cases
specially
of
points
that
that
case
makes
to
the
end.
both
cases
which
say
we
approve
the
general
principle
but
in
specific
cases
we
have
to
invoke
a
stopple.
i
think
that
the
courts
clearly
say
we
approve
to
the
general
principle
of
back
taxes
because
we
approve
of
the
statute.
in
those
cases
the
city
and
the
county
respectably
gave.
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
well,
if
there
is
a
stop,
there
would
be
no
other
authority
to
collect
the
taxes.
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
well,
it
would
certainly
have
to
go
back
but
i
think
in
my
judgment
at
any
rate
that
whatever
stops
–
stopple
would
not
be
present
against
these
taxing
authorities
because
of
they
took
it
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
they
never
gave
these
people
reliance
that
they
would
asses.
and
in
addition
is
the
plaintiffs
who
asked
for
the
relief
and
i
do
not
think
a
stopple
would
be
proper.
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
case
is
of
course
one
involving
the
separation
of
church
and
state
and
is
in
fact
a
progression
of
the
walz
decision
decided
last
year
by
this
court.
i
do
not
premise
my
thinking
on
this
case
on
the
everson
decision.
i
believe
that
my
position
in
this
is
case
would
be
squarely
met
with
the
dictates
of
not
only
walz
but
the
three
cases
decided
this
year,
dicenso,
tilton
and
lemon.
this
court
has
said
in
those
three
cases,
as
well
as
walz
that
there
are
three
main
evils
in
which
the
establishment
clause
attempted
to
prevent
and
that
was
financial
aid
sponsorship
and
active
involvement.
and
we
measured
those
three
evils
by
three
tests,
we
are
told.
and
the
tests
are
whether
or
not
there
is
a
valid
secular
legislative
purpose.
the
second
was
a
test
decided
in
the
dicenso
which
is
whether
or
not
the
primary
effect
either
inhibits
or
advances
the
religion.
and
the
third
test
is
whether
or
not
there
is
excessive
entanglement
or
active
involvement.\
i
think
that
the
case
before
you,
honors
is
clearly
was
not
involving
a
valid
secular
legislative
purpose
as
seen
in
the
walz
decision
where
there
was
discussion
in
the
court
opinion
concerning
the
pluralism
of
religions
and
the
good
works
of
religion.
certainly
that
is
not
involved
where
we
have
a
commercial
parking
lot
and
that
incidentally
is
exactly
what
it
is,
were
involved
with
a
square
block
in
the
city
of
miami
which
occupies
a
127,500
sq.
ft.
of
which
75,000
sq.
ft.
is
this
commercial
parking
lot,
monday
through
saturdays,
is
all
stipulation
of
fact
but
it
is
not
contested
facts.
we
are
up
here
on
stipulation
of
that,
monday
through
saturday,
each
and
everyday
other
than
sunday,
this
religious
institution
rents
out
this
lot
other
than
to
those
particular
lots
within
the
290
which
are
used
for
persons
who
might
want
to
attend
church
that
day
for
a
choir
meeting
or
a
directors
meeting
of
some
kind.
other
than
the
portion
which
might
be
used
for
someone
who
might
have
some
business,
monday
through
saturday
in
a
church,
the
entire
rest
of
this
lot,
75,000
sq.
ft.,
290
parking
spaces
is
rented
out
commercially
six
days
out
of
seven
days
a
week.
this
is
stipulation
of
fact.
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
oh,
yes!
drive
your
car
and
you
pay
your
rent
until
you
go
out.
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
right,
we
do
not
know
that
it
is
necessarily
owned
even
by
a
church.
it
is
just
the
regular
parking
lot
for
anyone
who
does
not
have
business
in
the
church.
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
are
they
church
employees?
i
really
do
not
know
that
sir.
i
do
not
know.
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
i
really
cannot
tell
you
that
sir.
i
do
not
know
whether
or
not
that
at
least
it
that
i
know
that
the
lots
are
used
commercially,
six
days
out
of
seven
days
a
week.
i
do
not
know
if
there
is
anyone
else
has
intervened
between
the
church
and
perhaps
--
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
i
do
not
think
it
covers
that
your
honor.
but
i
do
not
really
think
that
gets
at
the
issue,
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
in
my
judgment
the
primary
effect
of
renting
out
monday
through
saturday,
290
spaces
or
almost
all
of
that
or
the
active
involvement
of
the
government
is
such
as
to
transgress
the
restrictions
of
the
establishment
clause.
i
think
that
is
really
the
issue
involved
and
i
do
not
think
whether
not
the
institution
itself
or
a
corporation
which
the
institution
has
contracted
with
actually
runs
the
lot.
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
i
think
it
is
constitutional.
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
i
think
so
but
this
lot
is
--
that
is
not
case.
stipulation
of
facts
of
course
is
--
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
they
are,
the
appendix
was
dispensed,
what
they
are
as
part
of
the
record
and
they
are
quoted
incidentally
at
length
in
the
appellee’s
brief.
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
they
--
well
it
is
certainly
stipulations
of
facts
which
12
parties
entered
in
to.
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
i
do
not
think
that
those
facts
heard
at
all
in
issue.
i
do
think
that
we
have
some
very
important
things
to
decide
and
that
is
certainly
the
valid
leg
--
secular
legislative
purpose
is
not
there.
and
we
come
to
primary
effect
and
i
noted
the
language
in
tilton,
i
think
that
is
extremely
important
because
tilton
was
cited
on
the
bases
that
the
buildings
were
strictly
secular.
there
were
no
religious
symbols,
there
was
no
permeation
of
religion
on
a
higher
institutions.
it
was
strictly
secular
use.
so
the
court
was
concerned
with
the
use
of
these
facilities
or
what
is
the
use
of
this
facility?
six
days
out
of
seven
days
each
week
they
rent
out
this
parking
lot
and
they
take
in
a
profit
out
of
competitive
advantage
because
they
do
not
pay
taxes.
so
if
the
use
of
the
property
is
to
be
any
kind
of
criteria
as
apparently
it
was
not
the
tilton
decision
where
the
building
were
strictly
secular
and
the
court
dwelled
on
that
fact
and
certainly
the
use
of
this
property
commercially
with
cast
within
the
terms
of
the
establishment
clause.
and
certainly
also
within
the
terms
of
what
this
court
discussed
in
the
tilton
decision.
i
also
think
that
the
entanglement
that
we
get
involved
in
which
this
court
discussed
in
a
three
decision
this
year
and
the
walz
decision
last
year
is
present
in
this
case.
the
kind
of
political
divisiveness
which
this
court
says
if
not
inherent
in
our
people
is
certainly
involved
in
this
case
after
all
we
have
certain
court
that
attempted
to
tax.
we
have
a
supreme
court
of
florida
that
got
a
raised
at
the
circuit
court
in
reversed.
we
have
legislation
there
so
we
do
not
like
the
supreme
court
decisions
all
through
out
the
statutes
and
say
but
next
year
we
will
go
into
new
statutes.
we
have
a
raging
controversy
in
florida
over
this
lot.
and
a
very
political
divisiveness
which
this
court
seeks
to
prevent
is
exactly
what
we
have
with
the
commercial
parking
lot
in
miami.
now,
is
it
a
commercial
parking
lot
or
it
is
something
else?
the
district
court
down
there
said
it
was
commercial
parking
lot,
they
held
as
follows.
does
the
holding
in
walz
versus
tax
commissioner
supra
that
there
is
no
establishment
of
religion
and
no
inhibition
of
the
free
exercise
religion
in
a
state
taxation
scheme
which
exempts
from
taxation
property
use
“exclusively
for
religious
proposes”,
i.e.
religious
property
used
solely
for
religious
worship.
encompass
a
tax
exemption
in
the
instant
case
as
it
applies
to
church
property
used
as
a
commercial
parking
lot,
we
answer
affirmatively.
so
they
have
concluded
it
is
commercial
parking
lot.
but
why
have
they
decided
it
is
okay
a
novel
institution,
another
constitutional
principle.
they
said
because
the
proceeds
go
to
a
worthwhile
charitable
recipient
based
on
walz
and
the
court
based
their
decision
on
walz.
and
the
recipient,
we
are
going
to
hold
that
it
is
perfectly
alright
because
there
is
a
worthwhile
recipient
even
though
we
hold
it
a
commercial
parking
lot.
i
think
that
is
a
novel,
well
because
i
have
never
seen
any
establishment
case
really
that
looked
at
whether
or
not
that
worthwhile
recipient
was
such
as
to
permit
it
within
the
establishment
clause.
and
incidentally
the
very
kind
of
entanglement
is
inherent
in
that
kind
of
decision.
after
all,
the
sight
of
government
auditors,
government
inspectors
and
daily
surveillance
running
through
church
records
each
day
to
determine
where
the
funds
were
traced
to.
was
it
or
not
a
worthwhile
recipient?
that
is
the
very
kind
as
i
understand
it,
surveillance
which
this
court
says
is
not
proper
under
the
establishment
clause.
so
the
very
decision
of
the
us
district
court
calls
for
the
kind
of
surveillance
which
is
traced
the
funds
and
with
this
worthwhile,
fine,
it
is
not
worthwhile.
then
we
do
something
about
it.
now,
i
think
along
these
very
same
lines
and
counsel
and
i
may
have
difference
here.
i
think
we
do.
the
new
statute
which
is
going
to
go
into
effect
next
year
is
even
worse
than
this
one
because
the
new
statute
says,
well,
whether
we
will
break
it
off
at
50%
and
if
it
is
less
than
50%
we
will
prorate
it.
so
the
government
auditors
or
inspectors
for
daily
policing
of
going
through
the
records
of
the
church
of
this
290
spaces
and
it
was
like,
you
use
this
space
monday,
wednesday
and
friday
for
commercial
purposes.
use
this
space,
tuesday
and
thursday
for
religious
purposes
and
they
will
have
to
go,
how
many
spaces
were
used
for
religious
purposes?
how
many
for
commercial
purposes?
and
the
very
surveillance,
the
very
abhorrent
kind
of
degrading
situation
not
only
for
the
government
but
for
the
religious
institution
is
inherent
in
the
new
formula.
it
does
not
cure
it.
it
makes
it
worst,
the
new
statute.
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
we
are
at
odds.
i
think
that
the
new
statute
is
going
to
worst
in
the
old
statute
because
i
think
it
calls
for
greater
entanglement
even
in
the
old
one
does.
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
yes,
sir.
we
are
at
odds
on
that
point
and
i
wanted
to
practice
my
remarks
in
that
regard.
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
i
want
to
direct
my
remainder
of
the
marks,
the
mootness
issue
because
i
think
it
is
vicious
in
all
respect.
it
is
vicious
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all
let
us
get
to
the
back
taxing.
back
taxing
is
specifically
permitted
in
the
florida.
it
is
specifically
permitted
by
florida
statute
193.092
and
the
two
cases
cited
by
appellees
which
was
a
city
of
naples
case
in
the
blount
case
stand
for
the
proposition
that
back
taxing
is
permitted.
in
fact,
the
two
cases
say
so.
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
yes,
sir.
i
think
it
does.
because
i
think
it
is
a
matter
--
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
which
tells
us
that
--
the
establishment
of
religion
is
prohibited.
and
that
the
--
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
it
is
permitted
for
three
years
under
the
statute.
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
well,
perhaps
so.
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
well,
at
least
the
statute
permits
three
years.
in
fact
your
honor,
the
case
says,
are
these
the
very
case
cited
appellees
in
this
point,
case
says,
although
back
assessments
are
specifically
authorized
by
florida
statute.
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
well,
i
do
not
--
i
cannot
tell
the
court
what
procedure
to
use.
i
simply
think
that
--
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
the
county
authority,
the
taxing
authority
in
dade
county.
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
dade
county
is
the
defendant,
party
defendant
your
honor.
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
i
am
sorry
sir,
i
cannot
hear.
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
dade
county,
florida
is
a
party
to
this
suit
your
honor.
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
and
mr.
r.k.
overspeed
the
tax
collector
dade
county,
is
it
not?
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
this
has
been
implicit,
they
attempted
to
assess
the
taxes.
the
florida
supreme
court
said
it
cannot
do
it.
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
the
--
well,
my
complaint
calls
for
the
taxation
of
it.
perhaps
i
did
not
spell
it
out,
i
know
only
aobut
taxation
but
i
want
back
taxation
as
well
but
i
think
my
complaint
covers
exactly
what
we
are
looking
for.
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
oh,
yes,
sir.
i
have
no
question
about
it
because
i
think
the
case
is
in
florida
specifically
permitted.
i
call
your
honor
--
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
yes,
sir.
the
case
is
although
back
assessments
as
specifically
authorized
by
florida
statute
of
193.23,
f.s.a,
equitable
estoppel
present
the
city
in
this
case
where
good
faith
is
not
disputed.
that
case
happens
to
involve
where
the
city
is
--
certain
reliance
was
placed
upon
what
the
city
or
county
have
done.
so
they
said,
well,
in
this
case
you
cannot
do
it.
but
the
general
principal
in
the
statute
was
upheld.
they
did
the
same
thing
in
crockett
versys
lynch
(ph).
in
crockett
versys
lynch,
they
specifically
said,
however,
from
defendant
appellants
brief
and
we
took
--
we
determined
the
trial
of
trial
judge
concluded
that
the
back
assessments
involved
herein
were
specifically
authorized
by
statute
193.23,
florida
statutes.
we
agree
with
this
conclusion.
they
then
said
well
because
of
certain
reasons
in
this
case
we
feel
that
we
have
to
stop
taxing
authorities
because
the
more
--
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
but
not
stopple
against
to
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
it
was
a
stopple
against
the
taxing
authorities.
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
why
would
the
plaintiffs
who
never
mislead
or
never
intended
to
rely
on
anyone
--
never
gave
reliance
upon
this
people
possibly
be
stopped.
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
i
think
so,
and
i
think
--
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
that
is
right.
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
well,
the
county
never
gave
these
people
reliance
that
they
would
not
tax
--
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
well,
i
think
that
this
court
can
take
notice
of
the
florida
state
--
of
the
florida
cases
on
(voice
overlap).
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
that
is
a
--
i
think
that
if
your
honor
really
looks
at
this
cases
specially
of
points
that
that
case
makes
to
the
end.
both
cases
which
say
we
approve
the
general
principle
but
in
specific
cases
we
have
to
invoke
a
stopple.
i
think
that
the
courts
clearly
say
we
approve
to
the
general
principle
of
back
taxes
because
we
approve
of
the
statute.
in
those
cases
the
city
and
the
county
respectably
gave.
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
well,
if
there
is
a
stop,
there
would
be
no
other
authority
to
collect
the
taxes.
mr.
howard
j.
hollander
well,
it
would
certainly
have
to
go
back
but
i
think
in
my
judgment
at
any
rate
that
whatever
stops
–
stopple
would
not
be
present
against
these
taxing
authorities
because
of
they
took
it
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
they
never
gave
these
people
reliance
that
they
would
asses.
and
in
addition
is
the
plaintiffs
who
asked
for
the
relief
and
i
do
not
think
a
stopple
would
be
proper.
