is
there
anything
that

justice
thurgood

is
there

to
say
that
he
is
not
detached?
he
is
certainly
not
connected
with
police
department?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah,
but
the
florida

has
any
limitation
on
the
ability
of
a
magistrate?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah,
but
they
don't
say
what
he
has
to
be?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
doesn't
say
he
has
to
be
detached,
does
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
does
the
florida
statute
say
about
magistrates?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(voice
overlap)
any
state,
i
ever
heard.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
how
long
the
clerk
has?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
long
does
the
clerk
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
still
don't
see
the
tie-in
between
him
acting
as
a
magistrate
and
acting
as
a
clerk?
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
the
law
says
that,
deputy
clerk
of
any
country
may
also
act
as
magistrate?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
keep
saying
the
status
of
a
judge.
magistrates
are
not
judges?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
they
don't
have
the
authority
of
judges?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
true
in
florida?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
no
qualification
is
required?
justice
thurgood
marshall
magistrates?
justice
thurgood
marshall
sitting
at
bench.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
there
in
tampa?
the
man
opens
the
door
and
the
man
falls
out,
this
is
what
the
police
can
do
in
tampa?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
i
know,
that's
not
at
issue
here
at
all,
is
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
do
you
get
to
decide
on
he
would
go
on
and
keep
on
driving?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
appellant’s
position
was
that
you
couldn't
get
that
warrant,
unless
you
got
it
from
a
judicial
officer.
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
why
don't
you
give
the
summons
when
he
gets
out
of
tank?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
this
man
was
put
in
the
tank
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
didn't
you
say
any
drunken
driver
is
put
in
the
tank?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
he
is,
and
he's
put
in
a
tank,
you
say
you
go
get
a
warrant
from
the
deputy
clerk
and
arrest
him
after
that,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
couldn't
go,
get
the
arrest
warrant,
while
the
man
is
laying
on
the
street,
do
you?
let's
get
that
straight
now
what
do
you
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then
he
never
gets
a
warrant
after
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
the
point
is
that
what
we're
talking
about
is
where
it's
not
into
policeman's
presence,
is
that
what
we're
talking
about
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
mean
abolished
or
renamed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
i
come
from
i
have
municipal
court
there.
well,
where
are
you
going
to
try
traffic
violations,
i
know
you
won't
give
it
up?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
bee
we're
assuming
that
an
attack
is
made
on
the
search
warrant
in
florida.
could
you
take
that
all
the
way
up
here,
in
the
same
way
before

justice
thurgood
marshall
in
my
hypothetical
he
is
using
the
exact
same
proceeding
he
used
in
this
case,
is
that
possible,
in
florida?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
my
question
is
if
we
rule
with
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
then
every
preliminary
motion,
in
any
criminal
case
comes
right
straight
up
here,
before
the
man
is
ever
brought
to
trial?
justice
thurgood
marshall
like
my
brother
blackmun
i
got
the
problems
too.
justice
thurgood
