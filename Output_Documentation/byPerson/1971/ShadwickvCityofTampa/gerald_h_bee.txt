mr.
gerald
h.
bee
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
first
i
would
like
go
to
the
appellants'
argument
concerning,
in
the
very
last
portion
of
his
brief
and
on
argument
here
as
concerns
this
appellant
in
relationship
to
the
issuance
of
summons
to
come
into
court,
in
other
words,
an
invitation.
in
this
sense,
the
appellant
in
this
case,
of
course,
was
charged,
he
has
not
been
tried,
was
only
charged
then
immediately
then
proceedings
commenced,
so
he
has
not
been
tried
or
convicted.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
the
offense
was
under
the
ordinance
called
generally
careless
driving
while
drinking
which
is
a
phrase
i
use,
but
more
specifically
careless
driving
while
his
ability
to
drive
is
impaired
by
the
use
of
alcohol
or
a
drug.
but
they
shortened
that
and
call
it
careless
driving
while
drinking.
now,
this
is
a
violation
of
--
and
one
of
the
more
serious
violations
of
our
municipal
ordinances.
in
other
words,
we're
covering
an
area
here
and
you
have
to
realize
it's
all
the
way
from
a
parking
ticket,
speeding,
stop
light,
all
the
way
on
through
up
to
the
more
serious
offenses
such
as
this
one.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
no
sir,
that
is
one
of
distinguishing
features.
of
course,
if
a
parking
ticket
is
issued
and
the
fine
is
not
paid
then
they
are
summoned
to
court.
there
is
a
difference
here
between
this
type
of
offense
and
ones
that
are
less
offensive
than
those
that
do
not
outwardly,
what
you
would
call
jeopardize
life
or
property.
summons;
the
appellant
was
arrested
on
this
particular
offense
and
if
you
accept
what
appellant
is
saying
here
that
he
should
be
summoned
rather
than
arrested
on
the
street,
that
is
invited
to
court.
what
we
are
concerned
here
with
is
a
situation,
where
last
year
throughout
the
entire
united
states
28,000
deaths
occurred
by
reason
of
drunken
drivers.
now
that
is
not
to
mention
the
ones
that
remained
in
injury.
28,000
deaths
caused
by
drinking
drivers.
now
that
was
a
small
city,
an
island.
now
if
you
accept
the
appellant's
argument
that
he
should
be
summoned
and
invited
rather
than
arrested
in
this
particular
case,
what
you
are
really
saying
is
that
if
the
officer
sees
the
man
driving
the
automobile
down
the
road,
cars
going
in
every
which
way,
the
drunken
driver
weaving
from
side
to
side,
he
pulls
a
man
over,
he
stops
him.
the
door
opens,
the
man
falls
out.
he
writes
down
a
summons,
tears
it
off
and
says,
'here
is
your
summons.
now
you
go
home,
sober
up
and
appear
up
in
court
tomorrow
morning.
in
effect
this
is
saying
if
you
use
the
summon
system,
not
in
the
parking
ticket
--
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
then
what
he
does,
is
he
picks
him
back
up
and
they
call
the
paddywagon,
your
honor,
and
they
take
him
down
and
they
put
him
in
drunk
tank
for
approximately
four
hours
if
he
is
unable
to
manipulate
himself
what-so-ever.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
no
sir.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
well,
because
appellant
has
argued
and
in
his
brief
says,
that
we
should
give
this
man
summons
rather
than
arrest
him
on
the
street,
because
by
arresting
him
on
the
street,
what
your
are
doing,
the
appellant
says
--
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
yes
sir,
that
is
his
issue.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
i'm
only
starting
with
the
summons
portion
that,
this
type
of
offense
you
just
can't
use
a
summon
your
honor
because
this
way
you
don't
physically
arrest
him,
you
leave
him
in
jeopardy
only
--
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
why
can
you
not?
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
well
sir,
because
once
you
physically
place
a
person
under
custody,
when
a
police
office
takes
that
man
and
puts
him
into
custody
that
technically
is
an
arrest,
even
though
he
doesn't
say
“you
are
under
arrest”
or
if
the
man
doesn't
understand
it.
once
a
police
officer
--
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
no
sir,
i'm
not
saying
that
this
particular
man
is
put
--
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
i'm
saying
if
he's
so
inebriated
that
he
can't
control
himself,
he's
put
in
a
drunk
tank,
if
he
is
not,
he
is
not
put
in
the
tank.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
no
sir,
i'm
saying
--
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
yes
sir.
if
the
man
is
there,
he
is
arrested
on
the
street.
he
does
not
go
back,
because
the
officer
has
observed
the
offense
with
his
own
five
senses.
therefore
it
is
a
warrantless
arrest.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
no,
your
honor
but
he
does,
right
up
a
complaint
where
he
puts
down
the
various
factors
that
he
has
observed.
to
answer
to
your
question,
yes
sir
he
is
arrested.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
i'm
not
saying
that
in
this
case
because
in
this
case
we
don't
know
from
the
record
what
it
is.
this
case,
i
wish
i
did
know
and
i
wish
i
could
answer
your
question
your
honor,
but
on
the
record,
and
the
original
record
is
filed
here,
commences
as
the
appellant
started
this
case
with
his
motion
to
quash
the
original
affidavit
and
warrant.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
what
you're
saying
is
true
unless
the
man
is
incarcerated
post
bail.
now
this
is,
he's
arrested
in
officer's
presence.
he
is
incarcerated
he
posts
bail,
he
gets
out.
he
is
assigned
a
court
date
to
come
back
to
court,
but
on
that
date
he
does
not
come
back.
then,
the
police
officer
does
take
his
complaint,
another
complaint
and
he
goes
out
and
makes
out
a
rearrest
warrant
such
is
involved
in
this
case.
the
man
is
immediately
rearrested
but
in
the
original
arrest
it
was
the
violation
on
the
street,
initially
that
was
really
the
arrest.
so
--
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
no,
there
was
no
warrant
for
that
at
all
no
sir.
so
the
answer
to
your
question
can
be
two
ways.
a
warrant
can
be
issued
as
a
rearrest.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
or
as
an
original
arrest
if
it
was
not
in
officer's
presence.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
yes
sir.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
168.04
which
is
the
general
statute,
i
think
that
you're
referring
to
is
two
separable
parts.
the
first
part
dealing
with
the
clerk
and
the
second
part
dealing
with,
“the
marshal
may
issue
a
warrant
in
the
absence
of
the
clerk
and
the
mayor.”
this
is
the
general
law.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
now
in
tampa
we
do
not
have
a
marshal.
we
have
a
chief
of
police,
the
marshal
does
not
–
well,
we
simply
don't
have
a
marshal.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
yes
sir
but
the
general
law
which
provides
that
runs
throughout
for
all
the
municipalities
of
the
state
of
florida
whether
they
be
in
a
population
of
say
200
people.
in
that
case,
obviously
the
legislature
has
to
take
care
of
the
small
municipalities
as
well
as
the
larger
ones.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
yes
sir
that
is
true
under
the
general
law.
now,
the
point
is
this,
and
this
is
a
point
that
bothers
me
also.
this
particular
statute
is
in
two
parts
and
the
obvious
intent
of
the
legislature
in
passing
that
second
sentence,
involving
the
marshal
is
the
fact
that
often
times
in
your
small
town,
not
always,
the
town
may
only
have
a
mayor,
one
clerk
and
one
marshal
and
it
would
not
be
unusual
for
the
mayor
and
the
clerk
to
be
gone
at
the
same
time
in
one
day.
now
you
just
can't
let
law
enforcement
fall
down
for
the
one
day
if
the
clerk
happens
to
be
gone
or
the
mayor
is
out
of
town.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
but
that's
it.
this
case
involves
a
clerk.
in
any
event
if
the
court
goes
to
that
second
sentence
involving
a
marshal
and
would
by
dictum
hold
it
unconstitutional
or
whatever,
it
is
separable
from
the
first
sentence
which
deals
with
the
clerk
which
is
the
case
here.
now,
the
state
of
florida
has
been
referred
before,
has
passed
a
revision
of
it's
judicial
article,
it's
article
5,
consolidating
it's
judiciary,
especially
in
the
trial
court
systems
to
radically
keep
up
with
this
case
load.
but
the
point
is
that
this
question
may
become
moot
by
1977.
it
provides
in
that
article
that
the
municipal
court
shall
be
abolished
by
the
year
1977.
the
city
of
tampa
has
filed
with
chief
justice
roberts
of
supreme
court
of
florida,
a
resolution
of
intent,
a
resolution
of
intent
to
abolish
its
municipal
courts
by
the
end
of
this
year,
that
would
be
january
1,
1973.
what
in
fact
i'm
saying
is
simply
this
that
all
these
municipal
courts
and
their
clerks
will
be
abolished
by
1977.
tampa
is
moving
to
do
so
by
1973.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
no
sir,
it
would
not
but
i
felt
in
justice
this
should
be
pointed
out
to
the
court
and
brought
to
the
court's
attention
that
tampa
is
moving
in
this
direction
and
the
clerks
--
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
they
will
be
certainly
--
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
no
sir.
what
will
happen
when
i
say
abolish
the
municipal
court.
they
would
be
transferred
to
what
is
called
--
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
yes
sir.
they
would
be
transferred
what's
called
a
county
court
and
these
municipal
judges
will
then
becomes
state
judges,
these
clerks
will
then
becomes
state
clerks.
now
there
are
some
issues
that
were
raised
as
side
issues
in
the
appellant's
brief
concerning
the
conclusory
terms,
the
affidavit
is
formed,
the
rubber
stamp
arguments
and
simply
the
insufficiency
of
the
affidavit.
i
would
merely
show
the
court,
if
it
looks
at
the
original
motion
to
quash
and
the
order
of
the
first
municipal
judge
that
what
appellant
originally
attacked
in
this
case
is
the
constitutionality
of
these
particular
statutes,
vesting
the
power
in
the
clerk
to
issue
these
warrants.
furthermore,
there
was
never
a
question
of
did
he
determine
probable
cause.
the
question
attacked
the
power
of
the
clerk
in
the
first
instance.
if
you
look
at
the
order
in
municipal
court,
you
will
find
that
it
was
submitted
really
as
a
question
of
law
to
the
court.
the
appellant
did
not
produce
or
question
of
probable
cause
or
the
conclusory
terms
or
form.
there
was
no
testimony
of
officer
larga
(ph),
the
arresting
officer.
there
was
no
testimony
given
by
the
appellant,
there
was
no
testimony
of
the
clerk
and
there
was
no
testimony
taking
of
any
other
witness
in
this
cause.
in
other
words,
the
question
of
the
affidavit
or
did
he
determine
probable
cause
was
never
an
issue.
this
is
borne
out
on
certiorari
to
the
circuit
court
which
was
the
next
step
and
again,
there
were
four
specific
places
that
the
appellant
put
directly
in
question.
the
issues
that
were
raised
and
are
here
and
on
page
8
of
my
brief,
i
show
the
court
that
disposition
says
and
the
position
taken
by
appellant,
the
position
taken
by
the
petitioner
in
the
original
brief
is
that
the
city
charter
did
not
authorize
the
clerk
to
issue
an
arrest
warrant.
then
on
page
14,
this
is
on
page
14
of
the
appendix,
petitioner
--
then
the
appellant
says
again.
so
we're
here
today
solely
on
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
both
statutes.
appellant
says
again
on
page
14
of
the
appendix.
it
is
the
contention
of
the
petitioner
that
a
clerk
of
the
court
is
an
administrative
officer
and
not
empowered
to
exercise
and
discretion
and
then
he
goes
on
again
to
reemphasize
to
that
circuit
judge,
“we're
dealing
here
with
whether
or
not
a
particular
officer
can
exercise
judicial
functions?”
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
yes,
sir.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
i
do.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that
would
be
sufficient
to
bring
it
up
and
the
cause
determined
by
supreme
court
of
florida
in
particular
dealing
with
the
issues
that
it
would
be
classified
as
a
final
judgment.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
right,
he
could
be,
he
could
be.
what
an
essence
is
this
here
--
this
is
not
an
appeal
from
a
conviction
of
mr.
shadwick.
mr.
shadwick
was
arrested,
then
immediately
a
motion
was
filed
with
the
municipal
court,
and
certiorari
an
appeal
to
the
district
court
of
appeals
and
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
yes,
the
state
of
florida
--
the
essential
requirements
of
law,
if
the
defendant
feels
that
court
has
not
performed
within
the
essential
requirements
of
law,
he
has
a
right
to
common-law
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
circuit
court,
from
there
he
can
take
it
to
the
district
court
of
appeals
and
then
to
supreme
court
of
florida.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
yes
sir,
it
is.
usually
a
way
to
avoid
that,
the
finality
of
judgments
that's
true,
this
is
one
of
the
--
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
yes
sir,
i
understand.
in
the
record
itself,
in
the
appendix
you
will
find
when
i
argued
before
judge
neil
macmillan
at
the
circuit
court
level
on
certiorari,
i
argued
the
wrong
remedy,
that
was
i
do
not
have
the
page
in
the
appendix
because
it
was
not
in
my
brief,
but
it
is
--
i
did
argued
the
remedy
problem
that
it
should
not
worked
by
some
certiorari
originally.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
yes,
sir
--
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
yes,
your
honor.
in
other
words,
once
he
has
raised
this,
and
it
is
in
here
in
his
record,
and
he
has
order
of
denial,
this
goes
with
him
up
to
scale.
he
can
--
if
he
is
convicted,
see
he
will
never
appeal
to
the
circuit
court,
and
the
only
way
he
is
going
to
reduce
the
appellate
procedure
in
the
circuit
court
is
if
he
is
convicted.
now
suppose
mr.
shadwick
filed
a
regular
motions
he
did
here,
they
were
denied,
he
went
to
trail,
he
was
convicted
then
he
would
use
the
appellate
procedure
to
the
circuit
court,
and
he
would
have
in
his
appeal
the
assignments
of
error,
that
means
i.e.
the
denial
of
his
motion
in
the
lower
court.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
i
believe
normal
approach
of
attacking
validity
of
a
search
warrant
in
an
affidavit
is
that
if
the
motion
is
filed
and
the
judge
denies
--
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
i
would
–
your
honor
that's
a
hard
question
to
answer,
but
i
think,
i
think
it
would
be
and
the
reason
i
say
i
think
--
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
it
could
possibly
very
well
do
that
way
by
common-law
writ
of
certiorari
if
the
appellant
claims
that
the
essential
requirements
of
law
have
not
been
followed,
then
he
can
go
by
writ
of
certiorari
and
own
up
to
this
--
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
yes
sir.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
are
you
talking
about
the
writ
of
certiorari?
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
yes
sir.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
i
wouldn't
call
it
a
final
and
independent.
it
definitely
affects
the
rights
of
the
appellant
whoever
that
appellant
may
be
or
the
petitioner
taking
the
risk.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
that's
correct
--
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
yes
your
honor,
it's
independent
action.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
yes,
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
it's
another
avenue
of
approach
outside
of
the
avenue
of
appeal
and
by
error.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
i
believe
not,
i
believe
that
would
be
more
in
the
civil
field.
they
would
not
ask
for
declaratory
judgment
as
such
and
i
have
not
heard
it
your
honor.
it
has
not
arisen
as
such
out
of
our
municipal
courts,
let
me
put
it
that
way
your
honor,
but
we
do
in
civil
cases.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
no,
your
honor,
there
is
no
question
of
seizure
in
this
case
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
would
i
go
get
another
warrant
for
it?
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
well,
your
honor,
i
would
certainly
not
prosecute
it.
if
i
lose
a
request
that
would
be
prosecuted
at
this
level,
it
would
probably
be
no
prosecute.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
what
--
we
could
continue
prosecution?
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
yes,
sir.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
no,
sir.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
we
wouldn't
rearrest
him.
he
is
already
within
the
jurisdiction.
his
case
has
been
factual,
his
case
has
just
been
continued
until
the
disposition
of
this
and
then
a
trial
date
will
be
set
down.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
yes,
sir,
originally
he
was
out
on
bail
as
i
understand.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
not
on
the
merits,
no
sir.
i
can't
see
that
--
let
me
say
this,
the
disposition
of
the
case
here
would
have
something
to
do
and
that
would
have
to
happen
after
the
determination
of
what
this
court
arrives
at.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
i
am
not,
your
honor,
i
am
not
sure
that
i
follow
exactly
your
question
--
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
yes,
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
it
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
his
trial,
no
sir,
whatsoever
this
is
true.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
that's
true.
i
agree.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
well,
yes,
of
course
we
would
proceed
with
the
prosecution
but
not
if
this
particular
warrant
type
of
situation
is
held
unconstitutional,
then
we
--
certainly
wouldn't
come
back
and
use
that
same
type
of
warrant
to
go
out
and
arrest
--
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
yes
sir,
yes
sir,
it's
correct.
what
appellee
feels
is
a
real
--
is
the
real
jugular
vein
of
this
case
is
the
fact
that
the
appellant,
when
you
take
the
fourth
amendment
and
you
say,
no
warrant
shall
issue
but
upon
probable
cause
supported
by
oath
and
affirmation,
there
are
two
things
that
must
happen
here.
the
appellant
is
saying
he
wants
to
change
the
test
that
came
out
of
giordenello
and
johnson
case,
that
is
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate.
now
when
you
take
the
fourth
amendment
and
you
look
at
it,
nothing
there
says
who
is
it,
that
shall
issue
this
warrant.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
the
appellant
wants
to
change
this
test
from
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate
to
that
of
a
strictly
judicial
officer,
that
is
a
judge
who
adjudicates.
now
even
so,
the
second
thing
under
the
fourth
amendment
where
it
says
no
warrant
shall
issue
but
upon
probable
cause
supported
by
oath
or
affirmation,
nothing
is
said
of
what
kind
of
a
function
this
is.
now
that
i
contend
is
the
jugular
vein
of
this
case,
is
what
the
function
is
and
this
function
is
like
a
broad
spectrum.
you
have
over
here,
strictly
judicial
functions,
in
the
middle
you
have
the
quasi-judicial
functions
and
over
the
other
end
are
the
ministerial
which
are
those
involving
clerks.
we
are
simply
saying
by
virtue
of
these
statutes
that
the
legislature
has
delegated
to
this
clerk,
a
quasi-judicial
power,
he
has
move
him
from
his
normal
clerks.
he
still
does
the
ministerial
duties
of
a
clerk,
but
they
moved
him
into
the
middle
field
where
this
quasi-judicial
areas
are.
for
instance,
many
civil
service
boards
issuing
subpoenas
and
--
giving
out
quasi-judicial
acts,
that
is
all
the
statute
has
done.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
no,
sir.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
no,
sir.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
my
answer
to
that
is
simply
this.
as
i
recall
the
coolidge
case,
the
test
and
the
reason
why
you
cannot
a
state
attorney
or
prosecutors
because
he
is
so
involved
with
law
enforcement
and
the
test
of
this
course
is
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate,
must
be
interposed
between
law
enforcement
and
the
public.
yet
if
you
have
a
prosecutor
who
is
there
driving
his
case
home
or
a
state's
attorney
or
this
type,
then
i
would
say
that
he
does
not
fulfill
the
neutral
and
detached
magistrate.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
or
a
policeman
does
not
--
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
no,
sir,
we
do
not
have
that
system.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
yes,
sir,
the
statute
says
that,
but
the
special
acts
do
not
in
the
city
of
tampa.
we
do
not
have
marshals.
what
i
am
saying
to
the
court,
if
you
are
looking
at
that
issue.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
no,
we
have
many
clerks.
there
will
be
--
there
are
many
clerks
there.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
there
are
many
deputy
clerks,
yes,
sir,
your
honor.
in
other
words,
it's
not
the
situation
of
the
small
town.
the
point
is
this
court
has
ruled
in
ocampo
and
has
stated
specifically,
that
the
function
of
determining
probable
cause
for
an
arrest
is
only
quasi-judicial
in
the
middle
and
not
a
strictly
judicial
function
or
one
for
a
judge
to
adjudicate
sentence
and
find
innocence.
now
as
to
the
neutral
and
detached
magistrate,
the
clerk
of
that
municipal
court
is
appointed
by
the
city
clerk.
he
is
not
appointed
by
a
chief
of
police,
he
does
not
wear
a
uniform,
he
does
not
have
powers
of
arrest,
he
is
not
a
small
police
officer,
he
doesn't
wear
a
uniform,
he
doesn't
carry
a
badge
and
he
doesn't
carry
a
gun
and
he
certainly
doesn't
prosecute
cases.
he
is
assigned
to
the
judicial
part
at
the
city
of
tampa.
what
i
am
saying
is
under
the
broad
definition
that
i
have
pointed
out
in
my
brief,
the
magistrate,
the
clerk
does
fit
the
broad
definition
of
the
magistrate
that
this
court
held
in
compton
versus
state
of
alabama
and
florida
has
also
followed
that
in
miller
versus
mcloyd
case.
so
i
submit
to
the
court
in
conclusion,
and
pray
the
court
to
affirm
final
judgment
on
appeal
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
first
i
would
like
go
to
the
appellants'
argument
concerning,
in
the
very
last
portion
of
his
brief
and
on
argument
here
as
concerns
this
appellant
in
relationship
to
the
issuance
of
summons
to
come
into
court,
in
other
words,
an
invitation.
in
this
sense,
the
appellant
in
this
case,
of
course,
was
charged,
he
has
not
been
tried,
was
only
charged
then
immediately
then
proceedings
commenced,
so
he
has
not
been
tried
or
convicted.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
the
offense
was
under
the
ordinance
called
generally
careless
driving
while
drinking
which
is
a
phrase
i
use,
but
more
specifically
careless
driving
while
his
ability
to
drive
is
impaired
by
the
use
of
alcohol
or
a
drug.
but
they
shortened
that
and
call
it
careless
driving
while
drinking.
now,
this
is
a
violation
of
--
and
one
of
the
more
serious
violations
of
our
municipal
ordinances.
in
other
words,
we're
covering
an
area
here
and
you
have
to
realize
it's
all
the
way
from
a
parking
ticket,
speeding,
stop
light,
all
the
way
on
through
up
to
the
more
serious
offenses
such
as
this
one.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
no
sir,
that
is
one
of
distinguishing
features.
of
course,
if
a
parking
ticket
is
issued
and
the
fine
is
not
paid
then
they
are
summoned
to
court.
there
is
a
difference
here
between
this
type
of
offense
and
ones
that
are
less
offensive
than
those
that
do
not
outwardly,
what
you
would
call
jeopardize
life
or
property.
summons;
the
appellant
was
arrested
on
this
particular
offense
and
if
you
accept
what
appellant
is
saying
here
that
he
should
be
summoned
rather
than
arrested
on
the
street,
that
is
invited
to
court.
what
we
are
concerned
here
with
is
a
situation,
where
last
year
throughout
the
entire
united
states
28,000
deaths
occurred
by
reason
of
drunken
drivers.
now
that
is
not
to
mention
the
ones
that
remained
in
injury.
28,000
deaths
caused
by
drinking
drivers.
now
that
was
a
small
city,
an
island.
now
if
you
accept
the
appellant's
argument
that
he
should
be
summoned
and
invited
rather
than
arrested
in
this
particular
case,
what
you
are
really
saying
is
that
if
the
officer
sees
the
man
driving
the
automobile
down
the
road,
cars
going
in
every
which
way,
the
drunken
driver
weaving
from
side
to
side,
he
pulls
a
man
over,
he
stops
him.
the
door
opens,
the
man
falls
out.
he
writes
down
a
summons,
tears
it
off
and
says,
'here
is
your
summons.
now
you
go
home,
sober
up
and
appear
up
in
court
tomorrow
morning.
in
effect
this
is
saying
if
you
use
the
summon
system,
not
in
the
parking
ticket
--
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
then
what
he
does,
is
he
picks
him
back
up
and
they
call
the
paddywagon,
your
honor,
and
they
take
him
down
and
they
put
him
in
drunk
tank
for
approximately
four
hours
if
he
is
unable
to
manipulate
himself
what-so-ever.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
no
sir.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
well,
because
appellant
has
argued
and
in
his
brief
says,
that
we
should
give
this
man
summons
rather
than
arrest
him
on
the
street,
because
by
arresting
him
on
the
street,
what
your
are
doing,
the
appellant
says
--
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
yes
sir,
that
is
his
issue.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
i'm
only
starting
with
the
summons
portion
that,
this
type
of
offense
you
just
can't
use
a
summon
your
honor
because
this
way
you
don't
physically
arrest
him,
you
leave
him
in
jeopardy
only
--
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
why
can
you
not?
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
well
sir,
because
once
you
physically
place
a
person
under
custody,
when
a
police
office
takes
that
man
and
puts
him
into
custody
that
technically
is
an
arrest,
even
though
he
doesn't
say
“you
are
under
arrest”
or
if
the
man
doesn't
understand
it.
once
a
police
officer
--
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
no
sir,
i'm
not
saying
that
this
particular
man
is
put
--
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
i'm
saying
if
he's
so
inebriated
that
he
can't
control
himself,
he's
put
in
a
drunk
tank,
if
he
is
not,
he
is
not
put
in
the
tank.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
no
sir,
i'm
saying
--
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
yes
sir.
if
the
man
is
there,
he
is
arrested
on
the
street.
he
does
not
go
back,
because
the
officer
has
observed
the
offense
with
his
own
five
senses.
therefore
it
is
a
warrantless
arrest.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
no,
your
honor
but
he
does,
right
up
a
complaint
where
he
puts
down
the
various
factors
that
he
has
observed.
to
answer
to
your
question,
yes
sir
he
is
arrested.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
i'm
not
saying
that
in
this
case
because
in
this
case
we
don't
know
from
the
record
what
it
is.
this
case,
i
wish
i
did
know
and
i
wish
i
could
answer
your
question
your
honor,
but
on
the
record,
and
the
original
record
is
filed
here,
commences
as
the
appellant
started
this
case
with
his
motion
to
quash
the
original
affidavit
and
warrant.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
what
you're
saying
is
true
unless
the
man
is
incarcerated
post
bail.
now
this
is,
he's
arrested
in
officer's
presence.
he
is
incarcerated
he
posts
bail,
he
gets
out.
he
is
assigned
a
court
date
to
come
back
to
court,
but
on
that
date
he
does
not
come
back.
then,
the
police
officer
does
take
his
complaint,
another
complaint
and
he
goes
out
and
makes
out
a
rearrest
warrant
such
is
involved
in
this
case.
the
man
is
immediately
rearrested
but
in
the
original
arrest
it
was
the
violation
on
the
street,
initially
that
was
really
the
arrest.
so
--
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
no,
there
was
no
warrant
for
that
at
all
no
sir.
so
the
answer
to
your
question
can
be
two
ways.
a
warrant
can
be
issued
as
a
rearrest.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
or
as
an
original
arrest
if
it
was
not
in
officer's
presence.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
yes
sir.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
168.04
which
is
the
general
statute,
i
think
that
you're
referring
to
is
two
separable
parts.
the
first
part
dealing
with
the
clerk
and
the
second
part
dealing
with,
“the
marshal
may
issue
a
warrant
in
the
absence
of
the
clerk
and
the
mayor.”
this
is
the
general
law.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
now
in
tampa
we
do
not
have
a
marshal.
we
have
a
chief
of
police,
the
marshal
does
not
–
well,
we
simply
don't
have
a
marshal.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
yes
sir
but
the
general
law
which
provides
that
runs
throughout
for
all
the
municipalities
of
the
state
of
florida
whether
they
be
in
a
population
of
say
200
people.
in
that
case,
obviously
the
legislature
has
to
take
care
of
the
small
municipalities
as
well
as
the
larger
ones.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
yes
sir
that
is
true
under
the
general
law.
now,
the
point
is
this,
and
this
is
a
point
that
bothers
me
also.
this
particular
statute
is
in
two
parts
and
the
obvious
intent
of
the
legislature
in
passing
that
second
sentence,
involving
the
marshal
is
the
fact
that
often
times
in
your
small
town,
not
always,
the
town
may
only
have
a
mayor,
one
clerk
and
one
marshal
and
it
would
not
be
unusual
for
the
mayor
and
the
clerk
to
be
gone
at
the
same
time
in
one
day.
now
you
just
can't
let
law
enforcement
fall
down
for
the
one
day
if
the
clerk
happens
to
be
gone
or
the
mayor
is
out
of
town.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
but
that's
it.
this
case
involves
a
clerk.
in
any
event
if
the
court
goes
to
that
second
sentence
involving
a
marshal
and
would
by
dictum
hold
it
unconstitutional
or
whatever,
it
is
separable
from
the
first
sentence
which
deals
with
the
clerk
which
is
the
case
here.
now,
the
state
of
florida
has
been
referred
before,
has
passed
a
revision
of
it's
judicial
article,
it's
article
5,
consolidating
it's
judiciary,
especially
in
the
trial
court
systems
to
radically
keep
up
with
this
case
load.
but
the
point
is
that
this
question
may
become
moot
by
1977.
it
provides
in
that
article
that
the
municipal
court
shall
be
abolished
by
the
year
1977.
the
city
of
tampa
has
filed
with
chief
justice
roberts
of
supreme
court
of
florida,
a
resolution
of
intent,
a
resolution
of
intent
to
abolish
its
municipal
courts
by
the
end
of
this
year,
that
would
be
january
1,
1973.
what
in
fact
i'm
saying
is
simply
this
that
all
these
municipal
courts
and
their
clerks
will
be
abolished
by
1977.
tampa
is
moving
to
do
so
by
1973.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
no
sir,
it
would
not
but
i
felt
in
justice
this
should
be
pointed
out
to
the
court
and
brought
to
the
court's
attention
that
tampa
is
moving
in
this
direction
and
the
clerks
--
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
they
will
be
certainly
--
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
no
sir.
what
will
happen
when
i
say
abolish
the
municipal
court.
they
would
be
transferred
to
what
is
called
--
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
yes
sir.
they
would
be
transferred
what's
called
a
county
court
and
these
municipal
judges
will
then
becomes
state
judges,
these
clerks
will
then
becomes
state
clerks.
now
there
are
some
issues
that
were
raised
as
side
issues
in
the
appellant's
brief
concerning
the
conclusory
terms,
the
affidavit
is
formed,
the
rubber
stamp
arguments
and
simply
the
insufficiency
of
the
affidavit.
i
would
merely
show
the
court,
if
it
looks
at
the
original
motion
to
quash
and
the
order
of
the
first
municipal
judge
that
what
appellant
originally
attacked
in
this
case
is
the
constitutionality
of
these
particular
statutes,
vesting
the
power
in
the
clerk
to
issue
these
warrants.
furthermore,
there
was
never
a
question
of
did
he
determine
probable
cause.
the
question
attacked
the
power
of
the
clerk
in
the
first
instance.
if
you
look
at
the
order
in
municipal
court,
you
will
find
that
it
was
submitted
really
as
a
question
of
law
to
the
court.
the
appellant
did
not
produce
or
question
of
probable
cause
or
the
conclusory
terms
or
form.
there
was
no
testimony
of
officer
larga
(ph),
the
arresting
officer.
there
was
no
testimony
given
by
the
appellant,
there
was
no
testimony
of
the
clerk
and
there
was
no
testimony
taking
of
any
other
witness
in
this
cause.
in
other
words,
the
question
of
the
affidavit
or
did
he
determine
probable
cause
was
never
an
issue.
this
is
borne
out
on
certiorari
to
the
circuit
court
which
was
the
next
step
and
again,
there
were
four
specific
places
that
the
appellant
put
directly
in
question.
the
issues
that
were
raised
and
are
here
and
on
page
8
of
my
brief,
i
show
the
court
that
disposition
says
and
the
position
taken
by
appellant,
the
position
taken
by
the
petitioner
in
the
original
brief
is
that
the
city
charter
did
not
authorize
the
clerk
to
issue
an
arrest
warrant.
then
on
page
14,
this
is
on
page
14
of
the
appendix,
petitioner
--
then
the
appellant
says
again.
so
we're
here
today
solely
on
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
both
statutes.
appellant
says
again
on
page
14
of
the
appendix.
it
is
the
contention
of
the
petitioner
that
a
clerk
of
the
court
is
an
administrative
officer
and
not
empowered
to
exercise
and
discretion
and
then
he
goes
on
again
to
reemphasize
to
that
circuit
judge,
“we're
dealing
here
with
whether
or
not
a
particular
officer
can
exercise
judicial
functions?”
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
yes,
sir.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
i
do.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that
would
be
sufficient
to
bring
it
up
and
the
cause
determined
by
supreme
court
of
florida
in
particular
dealing
with
the
issues
that
it
would
be
classified
as
a
final
judgment.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
right,
he
could
be,
he
could
be.
what
an
essence
is
this
here
--
this
is
not
an
appeal
from
a
conviction
of
mr.
shadwick.
mr.
shadwick
was
arrested,
then
immediately
a
motion
was
filed
with
the
municipal
court,
and
certiorari
an
appeal
to
the
district
court
of
appeals
and
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
yes,
the
state
of
florida
--
the
essential
requirements
of
law,
if
the
defendant
feels
that
court
has
not
performed
within
the
essential
requirements
of
law,
he
has
a
right
to
common-law
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
circuit
court,
from
there
he
can
take
it
to
the
district
court
of
appeals
and
then
to
supreme
court
of
florida.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
yes
sir,
it
is.
usually
a
way
to
avoid
that,
the
finality
of
judgments
that's
true,
this
is
one
of
the
--
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
yes
sir,
i
understand.
in
the
record
itself,
in
the
appendix
you
will
find
when
i
argued
before
judge
neil
macmillan
at
the
circuit
court
level
on
certiorari,
i
argued
the
wrong
remedy,
that
was
i
do
not
have
the
page
in
the
appendix
because
it
was
not
in
my
brief,
but
it
is
--
i
did
argued
the
remedy
problem
that
it
should
not
worked
by
some
certiorari
originally.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
yes,
sir
--
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
yes,
your
honor.
in
other
words,
once
he
has
raised
this,
and
it
is
in
here
in
his
record,
and
he
has
order
of
denial,
this
goes
with
him
up
to
scale.
he
can
--
if
he
is
convicted,
see
he
will
never
appeal
to
the
circuit
court,
and
the
only
way
he
is
going
to
reduce
the
appellate
procedure
in
the
circuit
court
is
if
he
is
convicted.
now
suppose
mr.
shadwick
filed
a
regular
motions
he
did
here,
they
were
denied,
he
went
to
trail,
he
was
convicted
then
he
would
use
the
appellate
procedure
to
the
circuit
court,
and
he
would
have
in
his
appeal
the
assignments
of
error,
that
means
i.e.
the
denial
of
his
motion
in
the
lower
court.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
i
believe
normal
approach
of
attacking
validity
of
a
search
warrant
in
an
affidavit
is
that
if
the
motion
is
filed
and
the
judge
denies
--
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
i
would
–
your
honor
that's
a
hard
question
to
answer,
but
i
think,
i
think
it
would
be
and
the
reason
i
say
i
think
--
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
it
could
possibly
very
well
do
that
way
by
common-law
writ
of
certiorari
if
the
appellant
claims
that
the
essential
requirements
of
law
have
not
been
followed,
then
he
can
go
by
writ
of
certiorari
and
own
up
to
this
--
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
yes
sir.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
are
you
talking
about
the
writ
of
certiorari?
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
yes
sir.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
i
wouldn't
call
it
a
final
and
independent.
it
definitely
affects
the
rights
of
the
appellant
whoever
that
appellant
may
be
or
the
petitioner
taking
the
risk.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
that's
correct
--
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
yes
your
honor,
it's
independent
action.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
yes,
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
it's
another
avenue
of
approach
outside
of
the
avenue
of
appeal
and
by
error.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
i
believe
not,
i
believe
that
would
be
more
in
the
civil
field.
they
would
not
ask
for
declaratory
judgment
as
such
and
i
have
not
heard
it
your
honor.
it
has
not
arisen
as
such
out
of
our
municipal
courts,
let
me
put
it
that
way
your
honor,
but
we
do
in
civil
cases.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
no,
your
honor,
there
is
no
question
of
seizure
in
this
case
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
would
i
go
get
another
warrant
for
it?
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
well,
your
honor,
i
would
certainly
not
prosecute
it.
if
i
lose
a
request
that
would
be
prosecuted
at
this
level,
it
would
probably
be
no
prosecute.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
what
--
we
could
continue
prosecution?
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
yes,
sir.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
no,
sir.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
we
wouldn't
rearrest
him.
he
is
already
within
the
jurisdiction.
his
case
has
been
factual,
his
case
has
just
been
continued
until
the
disposition
of
this
and
then
a
trial
date
will
be
set
down.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
yes,
sir,
originally
he
was
out
on
bail
as
i
understand.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
not
on
the
merits,
no
sir.
i
can't
see
that
--
let
me
say
this,
the
disposition
of
the
case
here
would
have
something
to
do
and
that
would
have
to
happen
after
the
determination
of
what
this
court
arrives
at.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
i
am
not,
your
honor,
i
am
not
sure
that
i
follow
exactly
your
question
--
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
yes,
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
it
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
his
trial,
no
sir,
whatsoever
this
is
true.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
that's
true.
i
agree.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
well,
yes,
of
course
we
would
proceed
with
the
prosecution
but
not
if
this
particular
warrant
type
of
situation
is
held
unconstitutional,
then
we
--
certainly
wouldn't
come
back
and
use
that
same
type
of
warrant
to
go
out
and
arrest
--
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
yes
sir,
yes
sir,
it's
correct.
what
appellee
feels
is
a
real
--
is
the
real
jugular
vein
of
this
case
is
the
fact
that
the
appellant,
when
you
take
the
fourth
amendment
and
you
say,
no
warrant
shall
issue
but
upon
probable
cause
supported
by
oath
and
affirmation,
there
are
two
things
that
must
happen
here.
the
appellant
is
saying
he
wants
to
change
the
test
that
came
out
of
giordenello
and
johnson
case,
that
is
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate.
now
when
you
take
the
fourth
amendment
and
you
look
at
it,
nothing
there
says
who
is
it,
that
shall
issue
this
warrant.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
the
appellant
wants
to
change
this
test
from
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate
to
that
of
a
strictly
judicial
officer,
that
is
a
judge
who
adjudicates.
now
even
so,
the
second
thing
under
the
fourth
amendment
where
it
says
no
warrant
shall
issue
but
upon
probable
cause
supported
by
oath
or
affirmation,
nothing
is
said
of
what
kind
of
a
function
this
is.
now
that
i
contend
is
the
jugular
vein
of
this
case,
is
what
the
function
is
and
this
function
is
like
a
broad
spectrum.
you
have
over
here,
strictly
judicial
functions,
in
the
middle
you
have
the
quasi-judicial
functions
and
over
the
other
end
are
the
ministerial
which
are
those
involving
clerks.
we
are
simply
saying
by
virtue
of
these
statutes
that
the
legislature
has
delegated
to
this
clerk,
a
quasi-judicial
power,
he
has
move
him
from
his
normal
clerks.
he
still
does
the
ministerial
duties
of
a
clerk,
but
they
moved
him
into
the
middle
field
where
this
quasi-judicial
areas
are.
for
instance,
many
civil
service
boards
issuing
subpoenas
and
--
giving
out
quasi-judicial
acts,
that
is
all
the
statute
has
done.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
no,
sir.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
no,
sir.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
my
answer
to
that
is
simply
this.
as
i
recall
the
coolidge
case,
the
test
and
the
reason
why
you
cannot
a
state
attorney
or
prosecutors
because
he
is
so
involved
with
law
enforcement
and
the
test
of
this
course
is
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate,
must
be
interposed
between
law
enforcement
and
the
public.
yet
if
you
have
a
prosecutor
who
is
there
driving
his
case
home
or
a
state's
attorney
or
this
type,
then
i
would
say
that
he
does
not
fulfill
the
neutral
and
detached
magistrate.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
or
a
policeman
does
not
--
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
no,
sir,
we
do
not
have
that
system.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
yes,
sir,
the
statute
says
that,
but
the
special
acts
do
not
in
the
city
of
tampa.
we
do
not
have
marshals.
what
i
am
saying
to
the
court,
if
you
are
looking
at
that
issue.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
no,
we
have
many
clerks.
there
will
be
--
there
are
many
clerks
there.
mr.
gerald
h.
bee
there
are
many
deputy
clerks,
yes,
sir,
your
honor.
in
other
words,
it's
not
the
situation
of
the
small
town.
the
point
is
this
court
has
ruled
in
ocampo
and
has
stated
specifically,
that
the
function
of
determining
probable
cause
for
an
arrest
is
only
quasi-judicial
in
the
middle
and
not
a
strictly
judicial
function
or
one
for
a
judge
to
adjudicate
sentence
and
find
innocence.
now
as
to
the
neutral
and
detached
magistrate,
the
clerk
of
that
municipal
court
is
appointed
by
the
city
clerk.
he
is
not
appointed
by
a
chief
of
police,
he
does
not
wear
a
uniform,
he
does
not
have
powers
of
arrest,
he
is
not
a
small
police
officer,
he
doesn't
wear
a
uniform,
he
doesn't
carry
a
badge
and
he
doesn't
carry
a
gun
and
he
certainly
doesn't
prosecute
cases.
he
is
assigned
to
the
judicial
part
at
the
city
of
tampa.
what
i
am
saying
is
under
the
broad
definition
that
i
have
pointed
out
in
my
brief,
the
magistrate,
the
clerk
does
fit
the
broad
definition
of
the
magistrate
that
this
court
held
in
compton
versus
state
of
alabama
and
florida
has
also
followed
that
in
miller
versus
mcloyd
case.
so
i
submit
to
the
court
in
conclusion,
and
pray
the
court
to
affirm
final
judgment
on
appeal
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
