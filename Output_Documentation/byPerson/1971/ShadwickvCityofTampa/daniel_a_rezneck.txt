mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
the
court
below
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
certain
florida
statute
which
authorized
clerks
of
the
municipal
court
of
the
city
of
tampa
to
issue
arrest
warrants
for
persons
who
were
accused
of
violations
of
municipal
ordinances
is
raises
the
issue
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
no
sir.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
i
believe
that
you
do.
in
first
place,
i
think
that
a
counsel
for
the
city
as
i
understand
at
page
2
of
his
brief
does
characterize
this
as
a
final
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
i
think,
that
it
is
a
final
judgment
under
state
law.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
i
believe
that
it
is.
this
was
commenced
as
an
independent
proceeding
by
way
of
common
law
certiorari
in
the
circuit
court
of
hills
brooklyn
county,
which
is
a
court
of
journal
jurisdiction
to
review
the
decision
of
the
municipal
court
of
tampa
refusing
to
quash
the
warrant
in
this
case
and
it
was
--
the
writ
of
certiorari
was
denied
and
that
was
affirmed
by
the
district
court
of
appeals
and
by
the
florida
supreme
court.
so
that
this
common
law
certiorari
proceeding
which
is
an
independent
and
separable
proceeding
under
florida
law
is
at
an
end
and
i
think
that
does
make
this
final
for
this
court's
purposes
as
well.
in
other
words,
it's
not
a
part
of
the
pending
criminal
proceeding.
i
would
in
that
connection,
your
honor,
refer
you
to
this
court's
decision
in
camara,
the
municipal
court,
the
case
involving
administrative
searches
in
this
court,
which
involved
a
writ
of
prohibition
in
advance
of
a
trial
for
the
violation
of
municipal
ordinance
and
the
case
came
all
the
way
through
this
court
on
the
writ
of
prohibition
without
any
factual
record
or
without
any
trial
of
the
issue
and
it
was
decided
by
this
court
and
thereby
deemed
final.
so,
that
i
do
think
that
under
the
test
that
this
court
has
laid
down,
that
you
do
have
a
final
judgment
under
the
judicial
code.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
that
particular
issue?
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
i
do
not
believe
that
it
was
raised
and
that
issue
was
litigated
as
to
whether
it
was
a
final
judgment
or
not,
but
since
that
i
suppose
would
be
deemed
a
jurisdictional
matter
for
this
court,
i
think
the
fact
that
this
court
went
on
to
decide
the
case,
does
decide
the
jurisdictional
issue,
at
least
by
implication.
the
appellant
here
was
arrested
in
march,
1969
on
a
warrant
which
charged
him
with
violation
of
a
tampa
ordinance,
careless
driving
of
a
motor
vehicle
while
impaired
by
alcohol
or
a
drug.
this
warrant
was
applied
for
by
a
police
officer
of
the
city
of
tampa
and
it
was
issued
by
a
deputy
clerk
of
the
city
of
tampa
who
had
been
designated
as
a
clerk
of
the
municipal
court.
the
affidavit
and
the
warrant
appear
at
pages
6
and
7
of
the
joint
appendix
here.
this
offense
is
triable
in
the
tampa
municipal
court
and
it
carries
a
penalty
of
not
less
than
five
days,
no
more
than
six
months
in
jail
or
fine
of
not
less
than
$250
or
more
than
$500
or
both.
as
i
indicated
there
was
a
motion
to
quash
the
arrest
warrant
in
the
municipal
court
which
was
denied
and
then
the
common-law
certiorari
proceeding
was
brought
in
the
circuit
court.
it
was
denied
there,
affirmed
by
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
by
the
florida
supreme
court.
the
florida
supreme
court
opinion
is
at
pages
41
to
43
of
the
appendix
and
the
florida
supreme
court
held
that
clerks
and
deputy
clerks
of
the
municipal
court
are
authorized
under
florida
law
to
issue
arrest
warrants.
and
it
further
held
that
such
clerks
are
neutral
and
detached
magistrates
under
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendments,
“by
virtue
of
the
florida
statues
fixing
their
powers
and
duties
to
issue
arrest
warrants.”
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
no,
i
don't
believe
so.
no,
all
trial
jurisdiction
is
lodged
in
the
municipal
court
judges.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
no
as
i
understand
the
florida
law,
the
only
judicial
function
which
is
confided
to
the
clerk
is
the
issue
on
certain
arrest
warrant.
for
example,
he
does
not
even
have
the
authority
to
issue
a
search
warrant.
that
is
confided
solely
to
the
municipal
court
judges
and
of
course
to
other
judges
of
the
state
of
florida,
but
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes,
that’s
correct.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes,
that
is
precisely,
yeah,
right.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
i
think
it
is
very
much
different
because
the
arrest
warrant
powers
lodged
in
only
--
first
of
all
it
must
be
lodged
in
a
judicial
officer
in
the
federal
system
and
that
means
either
a
federal
judge
or
a
united
states
magistrate,
those
are
the
only
officers
who
would
constitute
the
judicial
officers
for
purpose.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
the
commissioners
were
judicial
officers
at
that
time.
they
were
--
they
operated
under
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
they
were
not
required
to
be
lawyers
until
the
united
states
magistrates
act
was
passed
in
1968.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes,
i
would
say
that
it
was
because
he
was
clearly
a
judicial
officer.
he
was
responsible
solely
to
the
courts.
he
had
a
specified
term
of
office,
in
that
sense,
he
had
a
guaranteed
tenure.
it
is
true
that
some
of
them
were
not
lawyers,
but
that
is
only
part
of
our
argument
here,
we
do
not
raise
--
rest
this
case
at
all.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
i
think
that
it
is
not
at
all
clear
from
the
florida
statutory
structure.
you
have
a
kind
of
a
mixed
situation
here.
he
is
actually
a
deputy
city
clerk
and
he
is
appointed
by
the
city
clerk
who
is
administrative
officer.
he
has
membership
in
the
city
civil
service,
and
in
that
sense
he
really
is
an
administrative
or
an
executive
officer.
he
is
designated
by
the
city
clerk
to
work
in
the
municipal
court,
as
a
deputy
municipal
court
clerk.
in
that
sense,
he
is
responsible
or
answerable,
i
suppose
to
the
municipal
court
judges
in
his
duties,
but
he
also
is
responsible
to
the
city
clerk
to
whom
he
is
a
deputy.
so
that
you
do
not
have
it
seems
to
me
a
clear
chain
of
command
here,
such
as
you
do
in
the
us
magistrate
system
and
as
you
did
under
us
commissioner
system
of
responsibility
by
the
officer
solely
to
a
judicial
authority.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
what
i
meant
was
that,
in
terms
of
his
jobs,
the
appointed
power,
his
responsibilities
also
run
to
the
clerk
who
appointed
him.
i
have
no
doubt
that
his
decisions
on
an
arrest
warrant
could
be
reviewed
and
in
fact
an
effort
was
sought
to
review
them
in
this
proceeding
before
the
municipal
judge
after
the
fact,
after
the
warrant
had
been
issued.
but
what
we
are
concerned
about
with,
i
think
are
his
status
and
his
independence
in
exercising
the
judgment
to
issue
the
warrant
in
the
first
instance.
in
other
words,
i
don't
think
it’s
sufficient
that
his
decisions
can
be
reviewed
later
on
by
the
way
of
quashing
the
warrant
before
a
municipal
court
judge.
i
don't
think
that,
that's
what
this
court
contemplated
when
it
spoke
of
an
independent
judicial
officer
or
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate
issuing
the
warrant
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
is
anything
that
says
he
is
not
neutral?
no,
and
i
don't
think
this
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
no,
we
are
not
alleging
that
he
is
connected
with
the
police
department,
but
we
do
not
think
that
this
case
ought
to
turn
on
an
inquiry
into
whether
a
particular
clerk
or
deputy
clerk
is
impartial
or
neutral
or
detached
or
capable
as
an
individual
of
having
those
qualities.
i
think
that
the
problem
about
the
florida
procedure
here
is
not
personal
really,
but
it’s
institutional
in
a
sense
that
the
clerk
has
not
been
given
the
kind
of
status,
independence,
there
are
no
qualifications
for
the
office
which
will
allow
him
to
exercise
these
powers
in
the
manner
contemplated
by
this
court.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
the
magistrate
is
purely
a
judicial
officer.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
no,
but
i
think
that
the
assumption
would
be
taxed
on
the
inference
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
it
doesn't
deal
with
the
point
of
detachment
in
those
words,
but
i
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
no
i
think
the
inference
of
detachment
and
neutrality
arises
from
the
fact,
that
he
is
clearly
a
judicial
officer.
in
other
words,
he
has
a
guaranteed
tenure
in
office.
for
example,
municipal
court
judge
has
a
four-year
term
in
office.
he
is
a
judge,
he
does
perform
judicial
functions.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
pardon
me?
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
the
clerk
is
under
–
is
a
civil
service
employee.
he,
as
a
municipal
court
clerk,
in
terms
of
exercising
this
arrest
warrant
function,
he
does
not
have
a
specified
tenure
in
office.
in
other
words
he
is
a
civil
service
employee
who
has
been
given
this
particular
function
to
exercise.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
but
his
primary
duties
are,
clerical
duties
and
they
are
the
usual
duties
that
one
would
associate
with
a
clerical
job.
he
has
been
given
this
one
particular
judicial
function.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
in
effect
that's
what
florida
has
done
here,
that's
what
the
florida
supreme
court
giving
him
the
title
of
magistrate,
without
giving
him
any
of
the
status
of
the
judge,
without
changing
his
essential
status
from
that
of
a
clerical
officer
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
they
do
not
have
the
name
of
judges,
they
do
not
have
the
title
of
judges,
but
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
i
think
that
they
exercise
judicial
authority.
they
have
a
guaranteed
tenure
in
office.
there
are
limitations
as
to
the
power
of
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes,
the
magistrates,
such
as
the
municipal
court
judges
have
a
four-year
term.
they
are
elected
and
have
a
four-year
term
just
as
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
in
a
tampa,
they
have
to
be
members
of
bar.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes,
municipal
court
judges.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
no,
under
a
new
constitution
which
is
going
to
go
and
which
has
been
approved
in
florida,
and
that
will
become
effective
several
years
from
now,
all
judges
with
the
exception
of
county
judges
and
counties
of
small
population
below
a
specified
limit
will
have
to
be
members
of
the
bar.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
under
the
florida
rules
of
criminal
procedures
as
i
understand
them,
either
a
felony
or
a
misdemeanor
warrant,
may
be
executed,
may
be
issued
by
one
who
is
defined
as
a
committing
magistrate
under
the
rules
and
committing
magistrates
include
all
the
judges
and
magistrates
of
the
courts
authority
down
to
including
the
municipal
court
judges
and
the
justices
of
the
peace.
however,
they
do
not
include
court
clerks
for
this
purpose.
so
you
have
really
a
paradoxical
situation
here,
where
for
a
felony
or
for
a
misdemeanor
warrant
and
that
was
for
a
more
serious
offense.
there
would
have
to
be
an
independent
judicial
determination
by
a
judge
or
magistrate,
in
other
words
by
an
officer
in
whom
the
authority
of
constitution
vests
judicial
power,
but
only
for
violation
of
the
municipal
ordinances,
is
a
deputy
clerk
or
a
clerk
of
court
who
is
not
a
judicial
officer
and
does
not
have
judicial
power
under
the
florida
constitution,
only
for
that
kind
of
warrant,
can
he
act
to
to
issue
it,
and
as
i
said
he
could
not
do
it
for
a
search
warrant
either.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
a
rather
strange
and
anomalous
situation
here
where
for
more
serious
offenses
and
for
search
warrants.
florida
court
clearly
it
does
carry
out
the
purpose
of
this
courts
decision
and
provides
what
independent
judicial
determination,
before
any
such
warrant
should
issue,
but
for
municipal
ordinances,
they
part
from
it
and
in
this
one
instance
they
do
authorize
the
clerk
to
do
it.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
i
think
that
would
involve
the
question
what
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes,
he
could
not
do
under
florida
law.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes,
well
i
think,
that
would
require
the
decision
by
this
court
which
i
don't
leave
has
been
made
ever
as
to
what
the
probable
cause
requirements
of
the
fourth
amendment
are
with
respect
to
municipal
ordinances.
i
think
the
common
law
would
be
that,
where
you
are
dealing
with
an
offense
of
that
character
that
the
arrest
power
of
an
officer
without
a
warrant
would
be
limited
to
a
situation
where
it
was
committed
in
his
presence.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
i
think
that
there
is
a
legislative
authority
in
some
situations
certainly,
and
i
know
it
has
been
exercised
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
to
give
the
police
the
authority
to
arrest
on
probable
cause
for
certain
misdemeanors.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
i
assume
that
there
are
similar
statutes
in
the
state,
and
i
think
that
will
allow
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
no,
i
don't
think
so,
i
think
that
there
would
be
a
power
in
the
legislature
to
define
a
reason
to
resemble
search
procedure
to
that
extent,
but
i
would
point
out
we're
not
dealing
with
that
here
because
florida
has
the
authority
to
do
that.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes,
but
it
requires
a
warrant,
in
other
words,
this
is
an
arrest
warrant
which
is
required
under
the
state
law.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
for
this
kind
of
offense,
i'm
not
sure
that
i
would
want
to
see
that
because
i
don't
think
that
we're
dealing
with
this
kind
of
offense
that
you
have
the
sort
of
necessity
that
might
justify
that
practice.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well
for
a
felony,
i
think
it's
clear
under
the
common
law
and
under
the
fourth
amendment
which
incorporate
the
common-law
rule
that
a
police
officer
can
arrest
on
probable
cause
without
a
warrant.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
certainly
a
common-law
he
could
not.
i
think
there
might
be
a
legislature
power
to
vary
the
common-law
rule
in
the
instance
of
certain
misdemeanors
whether
when
you
get
down
of
the
municipal
ordinances
level
and
that
power
will
also
extend.
i
don't
think
it's
really
necessarily
to
decide
your
honor.
the
state
of
florida
has
not
purported
to
do
that.
in
other
words,
they
--
you
are
dealing
here
with
an
arrest
warrant,
it's
a
fourth
amendment
warrant.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well
i
think
that
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
--
that
is
a
conclusion
drawn
by
the
florida
supreme
court.
i
don't
believe
that
it
is
possible
to
point
to
anything
in
florida
statutory
structure,
which
anything
objective
which
would
give
the
clerk
the
kind
of
independence
that
a
judge
has.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
i
think
that
you
have
your
supervening
federal
question
it
seems
to
me
under
the
fourth
amendment
as
to
who
is
a
neutral
and
detached
warrant
for
fourth
amendment
purposes
and
that's
a
federal
question.
i
don't
think
that
the
florida
supreme
court
can
decide
that,
and
in
effect
they've
given
their
opinion.
they
are
satisfied
that
he
is
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate,
but
i
don't
think
it's
possible
to
point
to
anything
in
florida
statutes
here
that
would
give
him
the
kind
of
independence
and
statute
that
the
united
stated
magistrate,
for
example
has,
or
that
other
judicial
officers
in
florida
have,
or
the
judicial
officers
elsewhere
in
the
united
states
to
issue
warrants
have.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
from
the
statutes
of
florida,
one
statute
of
general
applicability
which
gives
clerks
of
the
municipal
court
the
authority
to
issue
warrants
in
municipal
ordinances
cases
and
then
from
two
specific
statutes
applicable
in
tampa
which
are
part
of
the
tampa
city
charter.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
alright,
absolutely
we
are
dealing
with
a
legislative
act
here.
we
do
not
deny
that
and
we
are
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
that
statute
on
it's
face
on
the
grounds
that
it
isn't
sufficient
for
the
legislature
just
to
say
that
somebody
who
is
a
clerical
person,
is
ipso
facto
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate
because
we've
chosen
to
give
him
the
power
to
issue
arrest
warrants,
and
have
said
that
he
is
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate.
in
other
words,
that's
really
all
that
you
have
here.
you
have
a
statute
that
has
confided
the
function
but
has
not
confided
or
conferred
any
of
the
protections
that
we
normally
associate
with
the
holding
a
judicial
office.
it's
giving
him
only
this
one
judicial
function,
it
isn't
as
if
it
is
is
given
a
whole
range
of
judicial
functions.
it
certainly
has
not
called
him
a
judge
or
a
magistrate
and
while,
i
would
not
suggest
that
the
title
is
dispositive,
i
would
point
out
your
honor
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
tremulous
commissioner
was
changed
by
congress
to
us
magistrate
was
because
the
title
us
magistrate
denoted
that
he
was
a
judicial
officer
and
they
were
conferring
judicial
authority
on
him.
florida
hasn't
done
any
of
these
things,
nor
has
the
florida
supreme
court.
they
have
simply
said
we
are
satisfied
that
he
is
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
it's
not
in
the
record
before
you.
i
believe
it
is
contained
in
various
places
in
the
city
code,
in
the
city
charter
of
tampa.
there
is
civil
service
regulations
and
his
functions
are
predominantly
and
i
would
say
in
fact,
entirely
clerical
with
the
exception
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
some
of
them
do
that.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
he
receives
fines,
for
example,
and
gives
receipts
for
fines
in
traffic
cases,
he
prepares
the
dockets
and
the
records,
he
issues
the
commitment,
once
a
judge
has
ordered
as
opposed
to
sentence
on
seomone
the
deputy
clerk
makes
out
the
commitment
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes
and
more
specifically
i
would
say
in
any
police
court
or
any
municipal
court
in
the
country
that
you’ll
find
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
(inaudible)
if
the
case
is
continued
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
that
i
don't
know.
i
think
the
city
clerk
probably
will
have
that
function.
i
don't
believe
it
is
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes,
he’s,
i
believe,
the
power
to
issue
to
subpoenas.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
i
think
that
you
do
because
i
think
that's
florida
has
utilized
the
arrest
warrant
procedure
here
and
it
has
made
a
determination
that
it's
not
proper
for
a
policeman
to
arrest
simply
on
a
probable
cause
for
offenses
not
committed
in
their
presence.
in
other
words
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes.
well,
not
entirely.
for
example
in
the
groppi
case
as
i
recall,
groppi
v.
wisconsin
established
the
right
to
a
change
of
venue
in
a
misdemeanor
case.
i
think
this
court
said
that
it
was
not
passing
any
question
as
to
whether
he
would
have
had
for
example
a
jury
trial
right
as
an
original
matter,
but
they
said
that
the
state
had
provided
a
jury
trial
right,
and
once
they
did
that,
that
invoked
the
impartial
trial
guarantee
of
the
federal
constitution
through
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
therefore
they
could
not
provide
for
such
a
transfer
of
venue
in
a
felony
case,
but
not
in
a
misdemeanor
case.
so
i
think
it
is
of
significance
that
the
state
has
elected
to
utilize
the
familiar
arrest
warrant
procedure.
in
other
words,
you
really
are
dealing
here
with
what
i
would
call
frankly
an
ordinary
garden
variety
arrest
warrant.
there’s
no
–
nothing,
you
know,
that
the
state
of
florida
has
done
here
in
the
sense
of
deciding
that
they
will
extend
the
common
law
arrest
powers
of
the
police.
they’ve
directed
the
police
--
policemen,
as
would
be
true
all
over
the
country,
don't
give
a
warning
in
this
kind
of
situation.
we
would
submit
that,
that
is
sufficient
to
make
a
fourth
amendment
warrant
to
invoke
the
decisions
to
this
court
which
do
require
that
as
i
understand
that
he
be
a
judicial
officer.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
i
think
that
that
would
be
wholly
ministerial
power
that
would
not
be
classified
as
a
judicial
power,
because
you
do
not
have
the
elements
of
discretion
and
judgment
that
enter
into
the
warrant
decision.
certainly
it
is
not
a
fourth
amendment
type
of
decision
where
this
court
has
made
it
clear
that,
where
you’re
dealing
with
a
question
of
probable
cause
to
arrest
a
person
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
no
i
don't
dismiss
it.
in
fact
florida
had
provided
for
such
a
system
here
toward
a
summons
or
subpoenas
system.
i
don't
think
we
would
be
here
today
because
i
don't
think
we
would
have
the
same
problem.
in
other
words,
that
does
not
effectuate
an
arrest.
that
is
the
summons
or
subpoena
to
appear.
it
does
not
result
in
the
defendant
being
bodily
taken
into
court,
and
of
course
he
has
got
the
right
to
come
in.
he
has
the
option
to
come
or
not,
the
comity,
to
come
in
and
try
to
challenge
the
process.
in
other
words,
if
what
you
had
here
was
utilized
simply
a
summons
or
subpoena
procedure
issue
by
the
clerk,
i
think
you
would
have
an
entirely
different
case
because
then
you
would
not
have
an
arrest
of
the
person.
it's
the
fact
that
this
is
an
arrest
warrant
which
authorized
the
police
officer
to
take
the
defendant
immediately
in
the
custody
and
with
all
that,
that
implies
in
terms
of
loss
of
liberty,
having
the
post-bail,
possible
embarrassment
and
humiliation
in
terms
of
employment
and
with
family
and
of
course
an
arrest
record.
all
those
consequences
flow
for
what
happened
here,
because
it
was
an
arrest
warrant
rather
than
a
summons
or
a
subpoena
procedure,
so
that
i
think
that
the
subpoena
or
summons
procedure
is
particularly
where
you’re
dealing
with
the
municipal
ordinances,
although
these
are
not
emergency
situations,
these
are
not
serious
crimes
in
the
sense
of
felonies
where
you
can
dispense
with
warrant
altogether,
i
think
that's
really
the
proper
way
to
proceed.
in
that
connection,
i
would
like
to
direct
your
honor’s
attention
to
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota,
in
the
paulick
case
which
we
have
sited
both
in
our
brief
and
then
in
our
reply
brief.
the
court
there
took
precisely
that
position,
that
the
proper
way
to
proceed
in
these
cases
was
through
a
summons
procedure,
if
it
was
too
burdensome
on
the
judges
to
issue
arrest
warrants,
but
that
it
would
not
be
constitutional
under
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendments
for
deputy
clerk
in
minnesota.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
as
far
as
the
clerk
is
concerned?
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
our
position
would
be
exactly
the
same
because
the
florida
courts
have
read
in
a
requirement
and
i
think
this
case
does
it
that
the
clerk
must
find
probable
cause.
i
think
it
would
fairly
be
unconstitutional,
if
it
made
it
a
ministerial
duty
where
he
had
to
issue
the
warrant.
i
don't
understand
that
florida
has
gone
quite
that
far,
but
that
wouldn’t
make
any
difference
because
our
point
would
be
that
clerk
does
not
have
the
status
of
the
judicial
officer
and
make
that
determination.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
i
think
he
could
administer
the
oaths,
i
think
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
then
i
don't
think
it
will
be
any
different,
i
think
it
will
be
the
same
case.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes,
that
they
would
be
confining
to
the
clerk
a
judicial
determination,
the
probable
cause
without
giving
in
any
of
the
status
or
qualifications
of
an
independent
judicial
officer,
that
they
could
not
do
that.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
if
the
functions
of
the
magistrate
is
extended
to
issuing
arrest
warrants
or
search
warrants,
i
would
say
the
clerk
could
not
do
that,
could
not
be
given
that
power
and
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
not
without
more
--
not
if
he
remained
simply
a
clerk
and
was
not
given
any
additional
status,
any
additional
protections
in
office,
that
would
simply
be
changed
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
new
jersey
is
one
of
the
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
new
jersey
is
one
of
the
few
states,
i
might
say
that
does
authorize
its
clerical
personnel
to
issue
arrest
warrants.
there
would
only
be
a
relatively
few
states,
i
think
no
more
than
six
or
seven.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes,
i
believe
they
do,
but
of
course
the
new
jersey
statute
with
respect
to
the
warrant
procedures
those
quite
far
in
number
of
respects.
for
example,
it
authorizes
the
issuance
of
arrest
warrants
by
police
chiefs,
police
officers
and
in
charge
of
the
police
stations.
in
other
words,
parts
that
i
think
are
already
invalid
in
the
light
of
this
court’s
decision
in
coolidge
versus
new
hampshire,
this
isn’t
adding
very
much
to
that
in
our
view.
like
i
said,
there
really
is
a
paradoxical
situation
here
where
for
the
municipal
violation
of
the
municipal
ordinance
which
is
presumably
the
least
serious
of
offenses
in
the
state,
that
here
a
deputy
clerk
of
the
municipal
court
which
is
the
court
at
the
bottom
of
the
judicial
pyramid
is
authorized
to
issue
the
arrest
warrant,
but
for
any
other
offense,
no
other
clerk
in
florida
is
authorized
to
do
so.
i
think
what
that
suggests
is
that
you
do
not
have
a
very
fundamental
state
policy
here
in
favor
of
the
issuance
of
such
warrants
by
clerical
personnel.
if
i
have
anytime
left,
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
reserve
it
for
rebuttal.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
i
think
that's
for
the
state
of
florida,
for
the
city
of
tampa
to
decide,
your
honor,
as
to
where
they
want
to
proceed
from
here.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well
i
think
that's
a
decision
that
they
will
have
to
make,
but
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
i
believe
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
i
don't
think
we
can
assume
one
way
or
another.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
i
believe
that
they
do
provided
that
they
comply
with
constitutional
standards
in
how
they
do
it.
i
would
like
to
spend
a
brief
time
that
i
have
on
this
question
of
finale
since
it
is
obviously
at
some
concern
to
the
court.
the
test
that
was
laid
down
most
recently
in
the
mercantile
national
bank
versus
langdeau
case,
this
is
at
371
us
555.
as
i
understand
it
is
whether
the
order
is
a
separate
and
independent
matter
anterior
to
the
merits
and
not
enmeshed
in
the
factual
and
legal
issues
comprising
the
plaintiff's
clause
of
action.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
state,
straight
from
a
state
court,
yes
and
my
understanding
is
that
is
the
test
in
this
court
for
appellate
jurisdiction
under
1257
(2)
and
we
would
submit
that
we
have
met
that.
there
are
some
other
cases
i
think
i
could
cite
in
that
connection.
i
believe
this
court
in
mills
versus
alabama
at
384
us
214,
upheld
appellate
jurisdiction
over
the
denial
of
a
demur
by
a
state
supreme
court
even
though
the
state
supreme
court
had
remanded
the
case
for
trial.
so
the
separability
doctrine
has
been
applied
in
a
number
of
cases.
i
believe
also
in
the
old
ku
klux
clan
case
state
ex
rel.
bryant
versus
zimmerman,
that
came
to
this
court
i
believe
on
habeas
corpus,
in
advance
of
trial
and
was
decided
by
this
court
in
exercise
of
its
appellate
jurisdiction
even
though
there
had
been
no
trial
on
the
merits
and
the
case
was
still
awaiting
trial
in
the
state
court
and
i
did
also
cite
the
camara
case
which
i
think
is
close
to
this
one.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
the
issues
being
raised
by
the
defendant,
i
would
suggest,
that
was
respect
to
this
particular
issue
that's
before
the
court
here,
and
and
with
the
constitutionality
of
florida
arrest
procedure
that
there
is
nothing
further
to
be
done,
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
said
on
that
point
and
a
further
proceeding
would
not
illuminate
that
point
at
all,
and
i
would
l
think
that
that
would
meet
the
point
that
the
court
was
getting
at
in
mills,
unless
there
is
nothing
further
to
be
raise
on
that
particular
point.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes
your
honor,
i
understand
there
is
that
distinction
but
i
do
think
that
in
terms
of
the
issue
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
and
had
rearrested?
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
i
would
suppose
that
we
would
not
be
here
then.
that
would
have
mooted
the
case,
but
they
didn't
do
that.
i
just
want
to
make
one
final
point
on
the
state
law.
i
think
contrary
to
mr.
bee's
statement
that
it
is
not
at
all
clear
that
this
issue
could
be
preserved
in
a
state
court
at
trial
and
this
kind
of
certiorari
proceeding
may
well
have
been
required
as
a
method
of
preserving
this
point.
there
is
one
florida
case
that
i
would
like
to
give
the
court
the
citation
to
because
i
think
it
does,
bear
on
case,
called
campbell
versus
county
of
dade,
113
so.2d
708.
it's
a
district
court
of
appeals
decision
not
a
supreme
court
decision
in
florida,
but
it
does
deal
with
the
question
of
challenging
the
validity
of
an
arrest
at
the
trial
itself
and
i
think
that
in
view
of
that
decision
that
appellant
here
was
really
quite
justified
and
perhaps
required
under
florida
law
to
resort
to
this
independent
proceeding
and
it
is
an
independent
proceeding
under
state
law
and
i
do
think
that
you
have
a
appellate
jurisdiction,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
the
court
below
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
certain
florida
statute
which
authorized
clerks
of
the
municipal
court
of
the
city
of
tampa
to
issue
arrest
warrants
for
persons
who
were
accused
of
violations
of
municipal
ordinances
is
raises
the
issue
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
no
sir.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
i
believe
that
you
do.
in
first
place,
i
think
that
a
counsel
for
the
city
as
i
understand
at
page
2
of
his
brief
does
characterize
this
as
a
final
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
i
think,
that
it
is
a
final
judgment
under
state
law.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
i
believe
that
it
is.
this
was
commenced
as
an
independent
proceeding
by
way
of
common
law
certiorari
in
the
circuit
court
of
hills
brooklyn
county,
which
is
a
court
of
journal
jurisdiction
to
review
the
decision
of
the
municipal
court
of
tampa
refusing
to
quash
the
warrant
in
this
case
and
it
was
--
the
writ
of
certiorari
was
denied
and
that
was
affirmed
by
the
district
court
of
appeals
and
by
the
florida
supreme
court.
so
that
this
common
law
certiorari
proceeding
which
is
an
independent
and
separable
proceeding
under
florida
law
is
at
an
end
and
i
think
that
does
make
this
final
for
this
court's
purposes
as
well.
in
other
words,
it's
not
a
part
of
the
pending
criminal
proceeding.
i
would
in
that
connection,
your
honor,
refer
you
to
this
court's
decision
in
camara,
the
municipal
court,
the
case
involving
administrative
searches
in
this
court,
which
involved
a
writ
of
prohibition
in
advance
of
a
trial
for
the
violation
of
municipal
ordinance
and
the
case
came
all
the
way
through
this
court
on
the
writ
of
prohibition
without
any
factual
record
or
without
any
trial
of
the
issue
and
it
was
decided
by
this
court
and
thereby
deemed
final.
so,
that
i
do
think
that
under
the
test
that
this
court
has
laid
down,
that
you
do
have
a
final
judgment
under
the
judicial
code.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
that
particular
issue?
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
i
do
not
believe
that
it
was
raised
and
that
issue
was
litigated
as
to
whether
it
was
a
final
judgment
or
not,
but
since
that
i
suppose
would
be
deemed
a
jurisdictional
matter
for
this
court,
i
think
the
fact
that
this
court
went
on
to
decide
the
case,
does
decide
the
jurisdictional
issue,
at
least
by
implication.
the
appellant
here
was
arrested
in
march,
1969
on
a
warrant
which
charged
him
with
violation
of
a
tampa
ordinance,
careless
driving
of
a
motor
vehicle
while
impaired
by
alcohol
or
a
drug.
this
warrant
was
applied
for
by
a
police
officer
of
the
city
of
tampa
and
it
was
issued
by
a
deputy
clerk
of
the
city
of
tampa
who
had
been
designated
as
a
clerk
of
the
municipal
court.
the
affidavit
and
the
warrant
appear
at
pages
6
and
7
of
the
joint
appendix
here.
this
offense
is
triable
in
the
tampa
municipal
court
and
it
carries
a
penalty
of
not
less
than
five
days,
no
more
than
six
months
in
jail
or
fine
of
not
less
than
$250
or
more
than
$500
or
both.
as
i
indicated
there
was
a
motion
to
quash
the
arrest
warrant
in
the
municipal
court
which
was
denied
and
then
the
common-law
certiorari
proceeding
was
brought
in
the
circuit
court.
it
was
denied
there,
affirmed
by
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
by
the
florida
supreme
court.
the
florida
supreme
court
opinion
is
at
pages
41
to
43
of
the
appendix
and
the
florida
supreme
court
held
that
clerks
and
deputy
clerks
of
the
municipal
court
are
authorized
under
florida
law
to
issue
arrest
warrants.
and
it
further
held
that
such
clerks
are
neutral
and
detached
magistrates
under
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendments,
“by
virtue
of
the
florida
statues
fixing
their
powers
and
duties
to
issue
arrest
warrants.”
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
no,
i
don't
believe
so.
no,
all
trial
jurisdiction
is
lodged
in
the
municipal
court
judges.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
no
as
i
understand
the
florida
law,
the
only
judicial
function
which
is
confided
to
the
clerk
is
the
issue
on
certain
arrest
warrant.
for
example,
he
does
not
even
have
the
authority
to
issue
a
search
warrant.
that
is
confided
solely
to
the
municipal
court
judges
and
of
course
to
other
judges
of
the
state
of
florida,
but
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes,
that’s
correct.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes,
that
is
precisely,
yeah,
right.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
i
think
it
is
very
much
different
because
the
arrest
warrant
powers
lodged
in
only
--
first
of
all
it
must
be
lodged
in
a
judicial
officer
in
the
federal
system
and
that
means
either
a
federal
judge
or
a
united
states
magistrate,
those
are
the
only
officers
who
would
constitute
the
judicial
officers
for
purpose.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
the
commissioners
were
judicial
officers
at
that
time.
they
were
--
they
operated
under
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
they
were
not
required
to
be
lawyers
until
the
united
states
magistrates
act
was
passed
in
1968.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes,
i
would
say
that
it
was
because
he
was
clearly
a
judicial
officer.
he
was
responsible
solely
to
the
courts.
he
had
a
specified
term
of
office,
in
that
sense,
he
had
a
guaranteed
tenure.
it
is
true
that
some
of
them
were
not
lawyers,
but
that
is
only
part
of
our
argument
here,
we
do
not
raise
--
rest
this
case
at
all.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
i
think
that
it
is
not
at
all
clear
from
the
florida
statutory
structure.
you
have
a
kind
of
a
mixed
situation
here.
he
is
actually
a
deputy
city
clerk
and
he
is
appointed
by
the
city
clerk
who
is
administrative
officer.
he
has
membership
in
the
city
civil
service,
and
in
that
sense
he
really
is
an
administrative
or
an
executive
officer.
he
is
designated
by
the
city
clerk
to
work
in
the
municipal
court,
as
a
deputy
municipal
court
clerk.
in
that
sense,
he
is
responsible
or
answerable,
i
suppose
to
the
municipal
court
judges
in
his
duties,
but
he
also
is
responsible
to
the
city
clerk
to
whom
he
is
a
deputy.
so
that
you
do
not
have
it
seems
to
me
a
clear
chain
of
command
here,
such
as
you
do
in
the
us
magistrate
system
and
as
you
did
under
us
commissioner
system
of
responsibility
by
the
officer
solely
to
a
judicial
authority.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
what
i
meant
was
that,
in
terms
of
his
jobs,
the
appointed
power,
his
responsibilities
also
run
to
the
clerk
who
appointed
him.
i
have
no
doubt
that
his
decisions
on
an
arrest
warrant
could
be
reviewed
and
in
fact
an
effort
was
sought
to
review
them
in
this
proceeding
before
the
municipal
judge
after
the
fact,
after
the
warrant
had
been
issued.
but
what
we
are
concerned
about
with,
i
think
are
his
status
and
his
independence
in
exercising
the
judgment
to
issue
the
warrant
in
the
first
instance.
in
other
words,
i
don't
think
it’s
sufficient
that
his
decisions
can
be
reviewed
later
on
by
the
way
of
quashing
the
warrant
before
a
municipal
court
judge.
i
don't
think
that,
that's
what
this
court
contemplated
when
it
spoke
of
an
independent
judicial
officer
or
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate
issuing
the
warrant
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
is
anything
that
says
he
is
not
neutral?
no,
and
i
don't
think
this
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
no,
we
are
not
alleging
that
he
is
connected
with
the
police
department,
but
we
do
not
think
that
this
case
ought
to
turn
on
an
inquiry
into
whether
a
particular
clerk
or
deputy
clerk
is
impartial
or
neutral
or
detached
or
capable
as
an
individual
of
having
those
qualities.
i
think
that
the
problem
about
the
florida
procedure
here
is
not
personal
really,
but
it’s
institutional
in
a
sense
that
the
clerk
has
not
been
given
the
kind
of
status,
independence,
there
are
no
qualifications
for
the
office
which
will
allow
him
to
exercise
these
powers
in
the
manner
contemplated
by
this
court.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
the
magistrate
is
purely
a
judicial
officer.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
no,
but
i
think
that
the
assumption
would
be
taxed
on
the
inference
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
it
doesn't
deal
with
the
point
of
detachment
in
those
words,
but
i
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
no
i
think
the
inference
of
detachment
and
neutrality
arises
from
the
fact,
that
he
is
clearly
a
judicial
officer.
in
other
words,
he
has
a
guaranteed
tenure
in
office.
for
example,
municipal
court
judge
has
a
four-year
term
in
office.
he
is
a
judge,
he
does
perform
judicial
functions.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
pardon
me?
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
the
clerk
is
under
–
is
a
civil
service
employee.
he,
as
a
municipal
court
clerk,
in
terms
of
exercising
this
arrest
warrant
function,
he
does
not
have
a
specified
tenure
in
office.
in
other
words
he
is
a
civil
service
employee
who
has
been
given
this
particular
function
to
exercise.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
but
his
primary
duties
are,
clerical
duties
and
they
are
the
usual
duties
that
one
would
associate
with
a
clerical
job.
he
has
been
given
this
one
particular
judicial
function.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
in
effect
that's
what
florida
has
done
here,
that's
what
the
florida
supreme
court
giving
him
the
title
of
magistrate,
without
giving
him
any
of
the
status
of
the
judge,
without
changing
his
essential
status
from
that
of
a
clerical
officer
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
they
do
not
have
the
name
of
judges,
they
do
not
have
the
title
of
judges,
but
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
i
think
that
they
exercise
judicial
authority.
they
have
a
guaranteed
tenure
in
office.
there
are
limitations
as
to
the
power
of
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes,
the
magistrates,
such
as
the
municipal
court
judges
have
a
four-year
term.
they
are
elected
and
have
a
four-year
term
just
as
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
in
a
tampa,
they
have
to
be
members
of
bar.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes,
municipal
court
judges.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
no,
under
a
new
constitution
which
is
going
to
go
and
which
has
been
approved
in
florida,
and
that
will
become
effective
several
years
from
now,
all
judges
with
the
exception
of
county
judges
and
counties
of
small
population
below
a
specified
limit
will
have
to
be
members
of
the
bar.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
under
the
florida
rules
of
criminal
procedures
as
i
understand
them,
either
a
felony
or
a
misdemeanor
warrant,
may
be
executed,
may
be
issued
by
one
who
is
defined
as
a
committing
magistrate
under
the
rules
and
committing
magistrates
include
all
the
judges
and
magistrates
of
the
courts
authority
down
to
including
the
municipal
court
judges
and
the
justices
of
the
peace.
however,
they
do
not
include
court
clerks
for
this
purpose.
so
you
have
really
a
paradoxical
situation
here,
where
for
a
felony
or
for
a
misdemeanor
warrant
and
that
was
for
a
more
serious
offense.
there
would
have
to
be
an
independent
judicial
determination
by
a
judge
or
magistrate,
in
other
words
by
an
officer
in
whom
the
authority
of
constitution
vests
judicial
power,
but
only
for
violation
of
the
municipal
ordinances,
is
a
deputy
clerk
or
a
clerk
of
court
who
is
not
a
judicial
officer
and
does
not
have
judicial
power
under
the
florida
constitution,
only
for
that
kind
of
warrant,
can
he
act
to
to
issue
it,
and
as
i
said
he
could
not
do
it
for
a
search
warrant
either.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
a
rather
strange
and
anomalous
situation
here
where
for
more
serious
offenses
and
for
search
warrants.
florida
court
clearly
it
does
carry
out
the
purpose
of
this
courts
decision
and
provides
what
independent
judicial
determination,
before
any
such
warrant
should
issue,
but
for
municipal
ordinances,
they
part
from
it
and
in
this
one
instance
they
do
authorize
the
clerk
to
do
it.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
i
think
that
would
involve
the
question
what
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes,
he
could
not
do
under
florida
law.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes,
well
i
think,
that
would
require
the
decision
by
this
court
which
i
don't
leave
has
been
made
ever
as
to
what
the
probable
cause
requirements
of
the
fourth
amendment
are
with
respect
to
municipal
ordinances.
i
think
the
common
law
would
be
that,
where
you
are
dealing
with
an
offense
of
that
character
that
the
arrest
power
of
an
officer
without
a
warrant
would
be
limited
to
a
situation
where
it
was
committed
in
his
presence.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
i
think
that
there
is
a
legislative
authority
in
some
situations
certainly,
and
i
know
it
has
been
exercised
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
to
give
the
police
the
authority
to
arrest
on
probable
cause
for
certain
misdemeanors.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
i
assume
that
there
are
similar
statutes
in
the
state,
and
i
think
that
will
allow
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
no,
i
don't
think
so,
i
think
that
there
would
be
a
power
in
the
legislature
to
define
a
reason
to
resemble
search
procedure
to
that
extent,
but
i
would
point
out
we're
not
dealing
with
that
here
because
florida
has
the
authority
to
do
that.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes,
but
it
requires
a
warrant,
in
other
words,
this
is
an
arrest
warrant
which
is
required
under
the
state
law.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
for
this
kind
of
offense,
i'm
not
sure
that
i
would
want
to
see
that
because
i
don't
think
that
we're
dealing
with
this
kind
of
offense
that
you
have
the
sort
of
necessity
that
might
justify
that
practice.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well
for
a
felony,
i
think
it's
clear
under
the
common
law
and
under
the
fourth
amendment
which
incorporate
the
common-law
rule
that
a
police
officer
can
arrest
on
probable
cause
without
a
warrant.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
certainly
a
common-law
he
could
not.
i
think
there
might
be
a
legislature
power
to
vary
the
common-law
rule
in
the
instance
of
certain
misdemeanors
whether
when
you
get
down
of
the
municipal
ordinances
level
and
that
power
will
also
extend.
i
don't
think
it's
really
necessarily
to
decide
your
honor.
the
state
of
florida
has
not
purported
to
do
that.
in
other
words,
they
--
you
are
dealing
here
with
an
arrest
warrant,
it's
a
fourth
amendment
warrant.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well
i
think
that
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
--
that
is
a
conclusion
drawn
by
the
florida
supreme
court.
i
don't
believe
that
it
is
possible
to
point
to
anything
in
florida
statutory
structure,
which
anything
objective
which
would
give
the
clerk
the
kind
of
independence
that
a
judge
has.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
i
think
that
you
have
your
supervening
federal
question
it
seems
to
me
under
the
fourth
amendment
as
to
who
is
a
neutral
and
detached
warrant
for
fourth
amendment
purposes
and
that's
a
federal
question.
i
don't
think
that
the
florida
supreme
court
can
decide
that,
and
in
effect
they've
given
their
opinion.
they
are
satisfied
that
he
is
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate,
but
i
don't
think
it's
possible
to
point
to
anything
in
florida
statutes
here
that
would
give
him
the
kind
of
independence
and
statute
that
the
united
stated
magistrate,
for
example
has,
or
that
other
judicial
officers
in
florida
have,
or
the
judicial
officers
elsewhere
in
the
united
states
to
issue
warrants
have.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
from
the
statutes
of
florida,
one
statute
of
general
applicability
which
gives
clerks
of
the
municipal
court
the
authority
to
issue
warrants
in
municipal
ordinances
cases
and
then
from
two
specific
statutes
applicable
in
tampa
which
are
part
of
the
tampa
city
charter.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
alright,
absolutely
we
are
dealing
with
a
legislative
act
here.
we
do
not
deny
that
and
we
are
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
that
statute
on
it's
face
on
the
grounds
that
it
isn't
sufficient
for
the
legislature
just
to
say
that
somebody
who
is
a
clerical
person,
is
ipso
facto
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate
because
we've
chosen
to
give
him
the
power
to
issue
arrest
warrants,
and
have
said
that
he
is
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate.
in
other
words,
that's
really
all
that
you
have
here.
you
have
a
statute
that
has
confided
the
function
but
has
not
confided
or
conferred
any
of
the
protections
that
we
normally
associate
with
the
holding
a
judicial
office.
it's
giving
him
only
this
one
judicial
function,
it
isn't
as
if
it
is
is
given
a
whole
range
of
judicial
functions.
it
certainly
has
not
called
him
a
judge
or
a
magistrate
and
while,
i
would
not
suggest
that
the
title
is
dispositive,
i
would
point
out
your
honor
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
tremulous
commissioner
was
changed
by
congress
to
us
magistrate
was
because
the
title
us
magistrate
denoted
that
he
was
a
judicial
officer
and
they
were
conferring
judicial
authority
on
him.
florida
hasn't
done
any
of
these
things,
nor
has
the
florida
supreme
court.
they
have
simply
said
we
are
satisfied
that
he
is
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
it's
not
in
the
record
before
you.
i
believe
it
is
contained
in
various
places
in
the
city
code,
in
the
city
charter
of
tampa.
there
is
civil
service
regulations
and
his
functions
are
predominantly
and
i
would
say
in
fact,
entirely
clerical
with
the
exception
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
some
of
them
do
that.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
he
receives
fines,
for
example,
and
gives
receipts
for
fines
in
traffic
cases,
he
prepares
the
dockets
and
the
records,
he
issues
the
commitment,
once
a
judge
has
ordered
as
opposed
to
sentence
on
seomone
the
deputy
clerk
makes
out
the
commitment
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes
and
more
specifically
i
would
say
in
any
police
court
or
any
municipal
court
in
the
country
that
you’ll
find
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
(inaudible)
if
the
case
is
continued
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
that
i
don't
know.
i
think
the
city
clerk
probably
will
have
that
function.
i
don't
believe
it
is
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes,
he’s,
i
believe,
the
power
to
issue
to
subpoenas.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
i
think
that
you
do
because
i
think
that's
florida
has
utilized
the
arrest
warrant
procedure
here
and
it
has
made
a
determination
that
it's
not
proper
for
a
policeman
to
arrest
simply
on
a
probable
cause
for
offenses
not
committed
in
their
presence.
in
other
words
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes.
well,
not
entirely.
for
example
in
the
groppi
case
as
i
recall,
groppi
v.
wisconsin
established
the
right
to
a
change
of
venue
in
a
misdemeanor
case.
i
think
this
court
said
that
it
was
not
passing
any
question
as
to
whether
he
would
have
had
for
example
a
jury
trial
right
as
an
original
matter,
but
they
said
that
the
state
had
provided
a
jury
trial
right,
and
once
they
did
that,
that
invoked
the
impartial
trial
guarantee
of
the
federal
constitution
through
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
therefore
they
could
not
provide
for
such
a
transfer
of
venue
in
a
felony
case,
but
not
in
a
misdemeanor
case.
so
i
think
it
is
of
significance
that
the
state
has
elected
to
utilize
the
familiar
arrest
warrant
procedure.
in
other
words,
you
really
are
dealing
here
with
what
i
would
call
frankly
an
ordinary
garden
variety
arrest
warrant.
there’s
no
–
nothing,
you
know,
that
the
state
of
florida
has
done
here
in
the
sense
of
deciding
that
they
will
extend
the
common
law
arrest
powers
of
the
police.
they’ve
directed
the
police
--
policemen,
as
would
be
true
all
over
the
country,
don't
give
a
warning
in
this
kind
of
situation.
we
would
submit
that,
that
is
sufficient
to
make
a
fourth
amendment
warrant
to
invoke
the
decisions
to
this
court
which
do
require
that
as
i
understand
that
he
be
a
judicial
officer.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
i
think
that
that
would
be
wholly
ministerial
power
that
would
not
be
classified
as
a
judicial
power,
because
you
do
not
have
the
elements
of
discretion
and
judgment
that
enter
into
the
warrant
decision.
certainly
it
is
not
a
fourth
amendment
type
of
decision
where
this
court
has
made
it
clear
that,
where
you’re
dealing
with
a
question
of
probable
cause
to
arrest
a
person
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
no
i
don't
dismiss
it.
in
fact
florida
had
provided
for
such
a
system
here
toward
a
summons
or
subpoenas
system.
i
don't
think
we
would
be
here
today
because
i
don't
think
we
would
have
the
same
problem.
in
other
words,
that
does
not
effectuate
an
arrest.
that
is
the
summons
or
subpoena
to
appear.
it
does
not
result
in
the
defendant
being
bodily
taken
into
court,
and
of
course
he
has
got
the
right
to
come
in.
he
has
the
option
to
come
or
not,
the
comity,
to
come
in
and
try
to
challenge
the
process.
in
other
words,
if
what
you
had
here
was
utilized
simply
a
summons
or
subpoena
procedure
issue
by
the
clerk,
i
think
you
would
have
an
entirely
different
case
because
then
you
would
not
have
an
arrest
of
the
person.
it's
the
fact
that
this
is
an
arrest
warrant
which
authorized
the
police
officer
to
take
the
defendant
immediately
in
the
custody
and
with
all
that,
that
implies
in
terms
of
loss
of
liberty,
having
the
post-bail,
possible
embarrassment
and
humiliation
in
terms
of
employment
and
with
family
and
of
course
an
arrest
record.
all
those
consequences
flow
for
what
happened
here,
because
it
was
an
arrest
warrant
rather
than
a
summons
or
a
subpoena
procedure,
so
that
i
think
that
the
subpoena
or
summons
procedure
is
particularly
where
you’re
dealing
with
the
municipal
ordinances,
although
these
are
not
emergency
situations,
these
are
not
serious
crimes
in
the
sense
of
felonies
where
you
can
dispense
with
warrant
altogether,
i
think
that's
really
the
proper
way
to
proceed.
in
that
connection,
i
would
like
to
direct
your
honor’s
attention
to
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota,
in
the
paulick
case
which
we
have
sited
both
in
our
brief
and
then
in
our
reply
brief.
the
court
there
took
precisely
that
position,
that
the
proper
way
to
proceed
in
these
cases
was
through
a
summons
procedure,
if
it
was
too
burdensome
on
the
judges
to
issue
arrest
warrants,
but
that
it
would
not
be
constitutional
under
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendments
for
deputy
clerk
in
minnesota.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
as
far
as
the
clerk
is
concerned?
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
our
position
would
be
exactly
the
same
because
the
florida
courts
have
read
in
a
requirement
and
i
think
this
case
does
it
that
the
clerk
must
find
probable
cause.
i
think
it
would
fairly
be
unconstitutional,
if
it
made
it
a
ministerial
duty
where
he
had
to
issue
the
warrant.
i
don't
understand
that
florida
has
gone
quite
that
far,
but
that
wouldn’t
make
any
difference
because
our
point
would
be
that
clerk
does
not
have
the
status
of
the
judicial
officer
and
make
that
determination.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
i
think
he
could
administer
the
oaths,
i
think
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
then
i
don't
think
it
will
be
any
different,
i
think
it
will
be
the
same
case.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes,
that
they
would
be
confining
to
the
clerk
a
judicial
determination,
the
probable
cause
without
giving
in
any
of
the
status
or
qualifications
of
an
independent
judicial
officer,
that
they
could
not
do
that.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
if
the
functions
of
the
magistrate
is
extended
to
issuing
arrest
warrants
or
search
warrants,
i
would
say
the
clerk
could
not
do
that,
could
not
be
given
that
power
and
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
not
without
more
--
not
if
he
remained
simply
a
clerk
and
was
not
given
any
additional
status,
any
additional
protections
in
office,
that
would
simply
be
changed
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
new
jersey
is
one
of
the
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
new
jersey
is
one
of
the
few
states,
i
might
say
that
does
authorize
its
clerical
personnel
to
issue
arrest
warrants.
there
would
only
be
a
relatively
few
states,
i
think
no
more
than
six
or
seven.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes,
i
believe
they
do,
but
of
course
the
new
jersey
statute
with
respect
to
the
warrant
procedures
those
quite
far
in
number
of
respects.
for
example,
it
authorizes
the
issuance
of
arrest
warrants
by
police
chiefs,
police
officers
and
in
charge
of
the
police
stations.
in
other
words,
parts
that
i
think
are
already
invalid
in
the
light
of
this
court’s
decision
in
coolidge
versus
new
hampshire,
this
isn’t
adding
very
much
to
that
in
our
view.
like
i
said,
there
really
is
a
paradoxical
situation
here
where
for
the
municipal
violation
of
the
municipal
ordinance
which
is
presumably
the
least
serious
of
offenses
in
the
state,
that
here
a
deputy
clerk
of
the
municipal
court
which
is
the
court
at
the
bottom
of
the
judicial
pyramid
is
authorized
to
issue
the
arrest
warrant,
but
for
any
other
offense,
no
other
clerk
in
florida
is
authorized
to
do
so.
i
think
what
that
suggests
is
that
you
do
not
have
a
very
fundamental
state
policy
here
in
favor
of
the
issuance
of
such
warrants
by
clerical
personnel.
if
i
have
anytime
left,
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
reserve
it
for
rebuttal.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
i
think
that's
for
the
state
of
florida,
for
the
city
of
tampa
to
decide,
your
honor,
as
to
where
they
want
to
proceed
from
here.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well
i
think
that's
a
decision
that
they
will
have
to
make,
but
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
i
believe
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
i
don't
think
we
can
assume
one
way
or
another.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
i
believe
that
they
do
provided
that
they
comply
with
constitutional
standards
in
how
they
do
it.
i
would
like
to
spend
a
brief
time
that
i
have
on
this
question
of
finale
since
it
is
obviously
at
some
concern
to
the
court.
the
test
that
was
laid
down
most
recently
in
the
mercantile
national
bank
versus
langdeau
case,
this
is
at
371
us
555.
as
i
understand
it
is
whether
the
order
is
a
separate
and
independent
matter
anterior
to
the
merits
and
not
enmeshed
in
the
factual
and
legal
issues
comprising
the
plaintiff's
clause
of
action.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
state,
straight
from
a
state
court,
yes
and
my
understanding
is
that
is
the
test
in
this
court
for
appellate
jurisdiction
under
1257
(2)
and
we
would
submit
that
we
have
met
that.
there
are
some
other
cases
i
think
i
could
cite
in
that
connection.
i
believe
this
court
in
mills
versus
alabama
at
384
us
214,
upheld
appellate
jurisdiction
over
the
denial
of
a
demur
by
a
state
supreme
court
even
though
the
state
supreme
court
had
remanded
the
case
for
trial.
so
the
separability
doctrine
has
been
applied
in
a
number
of
cases.
i
believe
also
in
the
old
ku
klux
clan
case
state
ex
rel.
bryant
versus
zimmerman,
that
came
to
this
court
i
believe
on
habeas
corpus,
in
advance
of
trial
and
was
decided
by
this
court
in
exercise
of
its
appellate
jurisdiction
even
though
there
had
been
no
trial
on
the
merits
and
the
case
was
still
awaiting
trial
in
the
state
court
and
i
did
also
cite
the
camara
case
which
i
think
is
close
to
this
one.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
the
issues
being
raised
by
the
defendant,
i
would
suggest,
that
was
respect
to
this
particular
issue
that's
before
the
court
here,
and
and
with
the
constitutionality
of
florida
arrest
procedure
that
there
is
nothing
further
to
be
done,
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
said
on
that
point
and
a
further
proceeding
would
not
illuminate
that
point
at
all,
and
i
would
l
think
that
that
would
meet
the
point
that
the
court
was
getting
at
in
mills,
unless
there
is
nothing
further
to
be
raise
on
that
particular
point.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes
your
honor,
i
understand
there
is
that
distinction
but
i
do
think
that
in
terms
of
the
issue
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
and
had
rearrested?
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
i
would
suppose
that
we
would
not
be
here
then.
that
would
have
mooted
the
case,
but
they
didn't
do
that.
i
just
want
to
make
one
final
point
on
the
state
law.
i
think
contrary
to
mr.
bee's
statement
that
it
is
not
at
all
clear
that
this
issue
could
be
preserved
in
a
state
court
at
trial
and
this
kind
of
certiorari
proceeding
may
well
have
been
required
as
a
method
of
preserving
this
point.
there
is
one
florida
case
that
i
would
like
to
give
the
court
the
citation
to
because
i
think
it
does,
bear
on
case,
called
campbell
versus
county
of
dade,
113
so.2d
708.
it's
a
district
court
of
appeals
decision
not
a
supreme
court
decision
in
florida,
but
it
does
deal
with
the
question
of
challenging
the
validity
of
an
arrest
at
the
trial
itself
and
i
think
that
in
view
of
that
decision
that
appellant
here
was
really
quite
justified
and
perhaps
required
under
florida
law
to
resort
to
this
independent
proceeding
and
it
is
an
independent
proceeding
under
state
law
and
i
do
think
that
you
have
a
appellate
jurisdiction,
your
honor.
