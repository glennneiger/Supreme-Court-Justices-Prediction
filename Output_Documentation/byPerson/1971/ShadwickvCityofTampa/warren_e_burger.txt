chief

that's
by
virtue
of
the
limitation
that
the
florida
legislature
imposed,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
they
gave
a
limited
quasi
judicial
power
to
the
clerk?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
is
that
very
much
different
from
what's
done
in
the
federal
system?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
about
the
commissioner,
when
we
had
the
commissioners?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
there
a
time
when
the
united
states
commissioners
were
not
required
to
be
lawyers?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
until
1968,
would
you
say
that
the
posture
of
a
united
states
commissioner
was
very
different
from
that
of
the
clerk
exercising
these
functions
in
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
to
whom
is
the
clerk
of
court
responsible,
mr.
rezneck?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don't
think
this
clerk
is
responsible
solely
to
judicial
authority
when
he
is
performing
quasi
judicial
duties?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
tell
me
again
then,
what
is
the
source
of
his
authority
to
the
issuing
the
warrant,
from
what
does
it
derive?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
kind
of
legislative
decision
that
these
are
proper
officers,
as
mr.
justice
white
suggested?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
rezneck,
how
would
you
categorize
the
power
to
issue
a
warrant,
a
subpoena
rather
as
distinguished
from
a
warrant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
then
when
we’ve
considered
the
traditional
language
of
a
subpoena,
it
usually
has
the
arcade
form
of
briefing.
you,
the
undersigned
are
directed
to
appear
before
a
particular
court
at
a
time
and
place,
laying
inside
all
other
business
and
sometimes
it
will
recite
on
pane
of
penalties
of
the
law
for
failure
to
appear,
and
you
seem
to
dismiss
that
as
ministerial
duty?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
you
have
consumed
it
all,
but
we'll
see
what
the
situation
is
mr.
rezneck.
mr.
bee.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
could
--
the
issue
is
whether
you
could?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
bee.
you
have
ran
out
of
time,
mr.
rezneck,
but
we
will
give
you
two
minutes
or
three
minutes
if
you
think
you
need
it,
maybe
some
questions
to
you
also.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
have
got
to
assume
if
it's
irrelevant
at
all,
but
they
will
do
so,
isn't
that
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
have
the
power,
they
have
the
power.
chief
justice

you,

thank
you,
