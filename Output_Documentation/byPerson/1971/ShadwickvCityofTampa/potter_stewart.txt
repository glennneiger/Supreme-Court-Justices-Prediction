you
say
mr.
rezeck
you're
not,
of
course
you're
not
relying
on
the
title
and
the
label
of
clerk,
but
you're
rather
relying
on
the
nature
of
this
man's
job
and
duties
and
position.
justice
potter
stewart
where
does
that
appear
in
the
record,
i
looked
for
it
and
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
gather
that
what
you
say
is
correct
that
this
is
the
only
--
that
his
authority
to
issue
arrest
warrants
for
violations
of
municipal
ordinances
is
the
only
power,
the
only
duty
he
has
in
his
job,
is
to
perform
any
task
that
have
traditionally
been
considered
judicial
tasks.
what
--
do
we
have
any
thing
here
what
the
--
what
his
job
content
is?
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
he
--
does
he
file
papers
and
keep
track
of
them
or
send
in
the
courtroom
and
act
as
bailiff
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
does
he
do?
justice
potter
stewart
equivalent
of
a
clerk’s
office
in
any
court,
in
this
court
or
any
court?
justice
potter
stewart
track
of
fines
paid,
and
disbursements
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
payroll
for
the
court?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
offense
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
tampa
do
you
have
to
get
a
--
as
a
policeman
do
you
have
to
get
a
warrant
to
issue
a
parking
ticket?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
restoring
my
brother
marshal's
questions,
you
know,
what
kind
of
cases
is
this
applicable?
when
a
policeman
hears
and
sees
and/or
smells
and
touches,
he
is
using
his
five
senses,
that
his
five
senses
know
that
the
offense
is
committed
in
his
presence
then
he
arrests
the
person
and
this
procedure
is
not
applicable
to
all
as
i
understood
your
answers
to
justice
marshal's
questions,
is
that
right?
and
if
this
warrant
procedure
is
applicable
only,
while
there
is
a
complaining
witness
or
something
like
that
who
comes
to
a
policeman
or
comes
to
the
deputy
clerk,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
was
no
warrant
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
or
as
an
original
arrest
--
justice
potter
stewart
right
,
right.
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
however
an
independent
action,
as
i
understand
it
under
florida
law,
equivalent
or
roughly
similar
at
least
to
action
for
a
declaratory
judgment
and
an
injection
or
for
a
pre-trail
habeas
corpus
which
is
i
think
historically
well
known
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
final
judgment
and
an
independent
action,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
part
--
it's
not
part
of
the
criminal
prosecution,
it's
independent
action
--
justice
potter
stewart
independently
to
test
a
provision
under
the
law.
justice
potter
stewart
equivalent
as
i
say,
at
least
similar
to
an
action
for
a
declaratory
judgment,
or
an
injunction.
justice
potter
stewart
or
for
equivalent,
in
other
ways
to
a
pretrial
habeas
corpus?
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
mr.
rezneck
should
prevail
here
and
this
court
should
simply
hold
that
the
matter
of
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendment,
florida
could
not
constitutionally
confer
this
power
upon
a
deputy
clerk.
my
brother
is
correct
in
saying
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
merits
of
his
whether
or
not,
he
committed
this
offense,
nothing
to
do
with
his
trial
for
his
offense
and
absent
a
statute
limitation,
there
is
something
like
that,
you
would
just
have
him
arrested
under
a
warrant
issued
by
a
magistrate,
would
you?
justice
potter
stewart
all
that's
at
issue
here
before
us
is
the
validity
of
florida's
law
that
confers
upon
this
person,
the
power
to
issue
an
arrest
warrant?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
we
hold
that
mr.
rezneck
is
correct,
and
florida
acted
unconstitutionally
in
conferring
this
power
upon
deputy
clerk,
it
has
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
committed
this
offense
and
has
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
these
trial,
has
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
whether
or
not
he
cannot
--
after
this
court's
decision,
be
validly
arrested
under
a
warrant
issue
by
a
magistrate
unless
there
is
a
statute
limitations
problem.
justice
potter
stewart
nor
with
his
guilt
not
with
anything
or
is
there
any
evidence
that
might
come
into
that
trial
--
anything
else.
justice
potter
stewart
so
why
wouldn't
you
answer
to
my
brother's
white
--
rehnquist
questions,
yes
we
would
go
ahead
presumably
and
have
this
man
arrested
and
rearrested,
if
this
arrest
was
invalid,
have
him
rearrested
and
go
to
trial.
there
maybe
a
statute
limitations
problem,
but
if
there
isn't,
i
don't
see
why
your
answer
wouldn't
be
yes,
of
course,
we
would.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
but
you
would
go
before
a
judge
and
get
a
warrant.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
could
the
legislature
do
that
with
the
prosecuting
attorney
and
all
of
his
deputies?
justice
potter
stewart
just
saying,
we
know
that
they
are
his
normal
duties
or
be
--
or
the
prosecute
cases
but
we
are
going
to
give
him
this
little
sliver
of
judicial
power
and
allow
him
to
issue
arrest
warrants
and
even
search
warrants,
could
you
do
that?
justice
potter
stewart
why
not?
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
mr.
rezeck
you're
not,
of

you're
