justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me
mr.
rezneck,
are
these
clerks
permitted
some
times
as
substitute
for
the
judge
as
an
a
acting
judge?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
only
in
the
judge?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
i
know
in
my
own
state,
local
police
magistrates,
clerks
could
by
statute,
exercise
judicial
powers
i
believe
of
the
police
judges
in
certain
instances
when
the
police
judge
himself
was
absent,
that's
not
so
in
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
rezneck,
if
this
is
the
part
of
statute,
i'm
looking
at
your
brief
at
page
3,
and
that
third
line
after
--
and
where
it
took
and
may
issue
a
warrant
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
were
--
if
that
had
been
there
and
may
on
a
finding
of
probable
cause
issue
a
warrant,
what
would
your
position
be?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
i
am
just
changing
the
stats
by
adding
in
finding
a
probable
cause.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
take
it,
your
position
be
the
same
if
the
statute
said
only
that
the
clerk
may
exercise
the
powers
of
the
local
magistrate
insofar
as
he
may
administer
an
oath,
take
an
affidavit
so
forth
and
issue
of
warrant,
what
would
you
think
of
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
if
the
statute
said
that
the
clerk
may
exercise
the
powers
of
the
local
magistrate
and
he
suspects?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it'd
still
be
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean,
they
have
at
least
to
go
to
so
far
as
to
say,
the
clerk
in
the
absence
of
the
magistrate
may
perform
the
functions
of
the
magistrate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
couldn't
he
be
designated
an
acting
magistrate
in
absence
of
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
earlier,
that’s
right
then
that
whole
system
in
new
jersey.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
new
jersey
still
goes
as
far
as
it
used
to,
doesn’t
it,
to
permit
the
clerk
to
actually
to
function
as
the
magistrate
in
the
absence
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
who's
the
marshal
under,
what
officer
is
that,
marshal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
he
a
police
officer
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yeah,
but
who
is
the
marshal
now?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
is
a
marshal
a
policeman
wherever
they
have
a
marshal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
statute
then
means
that
not
only
the
clerk,
but
in
the
absence
of
the
clerk
and
the
mayor,
then
the
police
officer
may
issue
a
warrant
for
the
arrest
of
the
person
complaining,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
does
that
mean
mr.
bee
that
if
you
lose
up
here,
what
you
will
do
is
go
to
the
clerk's
boss
and
get
a
new
arrest
warrant
and
start
this
prosecution
all
over
again?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
you
lose
here,
on
the
ground
of
this
arrest
was
invalid,
then
what
you'd
do
with
the
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
go
to
the
magistrate
now
and
get
the
same
arrest
warrant
issued
by
the
magistrate,
wouldn't
you,
and
arrest
this
man
all
over
again.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
he
on
bail
or
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
a
policeman.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
you
--
new
statute,
you
told
me
earlier
in
the
absence
of
the
judge
and
mayor
or
the
mayor
and
the
clerk,
lets
the
policeman
issued
the
warrant.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
statute
says
so.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
in
tampa,
if
the
mayor
and
clerk
are
absent
then
no
one
can
issue
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
many
clerks
of
the
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
you
tell
me,
mr.
rezneck,
if
you
win
a
(inaudible)
victory
for
your
client
if
you
prevail?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know,
--
if
you
win,
what's
to
prevent
them
just
from
getting
a
proper
arrest
warrant?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
does
not
prevent
them
making
it
because
you
win.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me
mr.
rezneck,
are
these
clerks
permitted
some
times
as
substitute
for
the

as
an
a

justice
william
j.
brennan,

only
in
the
judge?

justice
william
j.

(voice

justice
william

new

still
goes
as
far
as
it
used

doesn’t
it,
to
permit
the

to
actually
to
function

in

is

a

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yeah,
but
who
is
the
marshal
now?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
is
a
marshal
a
policeman
wherever
they
have
a
marshal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
statute
then
means
that
not
only
the

in

wouldn't
you,

justice

was

on

justice
william
j.

or
a

justice
william

well,
if

the

and

justice
william
j.
brennan,

but
the
statute
says
so.
justice
william
j.

you
mean
in
tampa,
if
the

and
clerk
are
absent
then
no
one
can
issue
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

what
many

of

would
you

if
