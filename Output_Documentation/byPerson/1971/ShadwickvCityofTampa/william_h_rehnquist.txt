yes.
justice

mr.
rezneck,
if
florida
by
legislation
could
authorize
a
policeman
to
arrest,
if
there
were
in
fact
probable
cause
in
this
situation
without
a
warrant
and
if
in
fact
there
is
a
probable
cause
in
this
case,
do
you
have
really
a
fourth
amendment
point,
simply
because
the
policeman
has
taken
a
warrant
issued
by
a
clerk,
that
made
a
finding
of
probable
cause?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that’s
a
state
law
point?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
wouldn't
affect
the
applicability
of
the
statute
to
the
other
parts
of
florida,
would
it?

mr.
shadwick
didn't
wanted
to
file
a
special
writ
of
certiorari
and
had
simply
gone
to
--
gone
to
trial,
would
he
at
sometime
during
the
trial
proceedings
have
had
an
opportunity
to
raise
the
validity
of
the
warrant
as
a
part
of
those
proceedings?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
bee,
was
there
a
seizure
as
a
result
of
the
seizure
of
evidence,
as
a
result
of
the
arrest
in
this
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
so
the
determination
of
this
issue
up
here
will
have
virtually
nothing
to
do
with
his
trial
on
the
merits?
justice
william

rehnquist
was
that
a
federal
court
of
the
state?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
in
mills,
didn't
the
court
say
that
the
ruling
on
the
demur
was
for
all
practical
purposes,
a
determination
of
a
litigation
that
a
remand
was
just
going
to
result
in
a
formality?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
mills,
they
are
talking
about
the
merits
and
i
think
for
to
be
on
merits,
where
the
merits
were
criminal
prosecution
not
an
abstract
