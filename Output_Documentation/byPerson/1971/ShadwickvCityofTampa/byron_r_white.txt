for
fourth
amendment
purposes
if
a
police
officer
had
left
over
the
facts
here
and
thought
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
arrest
and
went
out
and
arrested
without
a
warrant
at
all.
whatever
the
situation
might
be
under
florida
law,
what
about
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
suppose
--
assume
for
the
moment
that
there
was
clearly
probable
cause.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
was
the
common
law,
what
about
the
general
proposition
of
the
police
being
able
to
arrest
without
a
warrant,
without
a
probable
cause?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
what
about
the
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
to
that's
unconstitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
it's
purported
to
say
that
a
clerk
can
determine
probable
cause
and
authorize
an
arrest?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
say,
florida
could
authorize
the
police
authority
--
the
legislature
could
authorize
police
themselves
to
determine
probable
cause
and
make
an
arrest?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
a
more
serious
misdemeanor,
for
a
felony
it
would
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
may
not
do
for,
do
so
for
a
less
serious
municipal
offense?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
florida
court
here
has
said
that
under
florida
law
that
the
clerk
is
sufficiently
independent
to
perform
his
function
as
a
matter
of
florida
law,
i
gather?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
your
opinion
anyway
--
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
indicates
that
he
isn't
neither
or
that
the
florida
supreme
court
is
wrong
and
as
a
matter
of
judicial
judgment
investing
at
this
court
with
some
independence?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
clerk
issued
one
here,
didn't
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
