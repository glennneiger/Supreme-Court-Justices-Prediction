justice

stewart
congress's
power
would
be
under
section
five
or
the
fourteenth
amendment
would
it?
justice
potter
stewart
are
there
any
states
left
that
in
which
the
legislature
has
said
that
the
death
penalty
inexorably
follows
from
the
conviction
of
the
certain
offense.
there
used
to
be
many,
are
there
any
left?
justice
potter
stewart
but
there
are
other
statutes
on
the
court
justice
potter
stewart
in
many
states
this
used
to
be
true
of
first
degree
or
deliberate
murder.
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
is
no
state
left
where
that
is
longer
--
any
longer
to
except
in
the
exceptional
kind
of
certain
statute
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
now
that
you
are
interrupted,
let
me
interrupt
you
with
the
due
process
clause
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
one
of
the
--
i
think
it
bothers
me
in
this
case.
i
think
it
is
more
than
just
a
matter
of
semantic
is
a
fact
that
in
that
due
process
clause
the
deprivation
of
life
is
expressly
mentioned,
and
at
least
by
negative
implication
is
expressly
permitted
of
the
state
to
deprive
any
person
of
his
life,
liberty
or
property
without
due
process
of
law.
it
is
another
expressed
almost
identical
mention
in
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
and
indeed
i
think
in
the
fifth
amendment
that
in
reference
to
capital
cases
with
implicit
approval,
explicitly
in
the
constitution
of
united
states.
and
this
as
i
say,
for
me
it
is
more
than
just
this
semantic
problem.
there
at
least
three
and
there
maybe
other
places
in
the
constitution
that
do
not
know
occur
to
me,
one
is
the
death
penalty
is
mentioned
and
with
implicit
approval.
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
now,
we
are
not
talking
about
what
was
the
practice
at
the
time,
the
constitution
was
adopted.
i
am
talking
about
the
word
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
which
you
are
invoking
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
certainly
you
would
agree
i
should
impose
that
argument
insofar
as
it
says
that
deterrence
is
not
the
sole
criteria
of
whether
the
punishment
is
cruel
and
unusual.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
in
other
words
i
suppose
that
disemboweling,
burning
of
the
state,
drawing
and
quadering
might
all
be
simply
deterrence,
that
if
you
follow
the
petty
larceny
with
and
that
would
of
have
answer
the
question
was
it.
justice
potter
stewart
well
then
is
it
your
submission
that
if
it
can
be
shown
that
a
punishment
served
a
deterrent
and
if
in
a
rational
persons
judgment,
that
is
the
appropriate
deterrent
and
then
if
no
more
form
pain
or
torture
is
inflicted
in
imposing
that
deterrence,
then
is
necessary
then
it
is
automatically
constitutionally
valid?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
it
would
be
true
horsewhipping
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
no,
but
if
rational
people
could
conclude
that
the
best
deterrent
for
petty
larceny
was
50
lashes,
then
it
would
not
be
cruel
and
unusual
so
long
as
51
lashes
were
not
imposed,
that
is
in
fact
the
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
the
course
that
fifth
amendment
also
talks
about
that
jeopardy
of
limb
and
the
double
jeopardy
provision,
the
first
and
shall
be
applying
with
capital
life
or
limb
and
i
suppose
you
would
not
use
that
to
argue
that
today
government
could
cut
off
that
arm
of
the
thief
would
you
and
without
violating
the
eight
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
where
do
you
find
the
word
limb
then?.
justice
potter
stewart
just
as
like
under
the
limb.
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
suggested
at
some
place
in
the
brief
(inaudible)
that
one
reason,
juries
these
days
are
(inaudible)
death
penalty
(inaudible).
the
morality
is
that
they

that
the
penalty
will
not
be
carried
out.
(inaudible).
it
is
a
statement
of
the
prosecutor
and
the
jury
of
pennsylvania
as
we
read
in

justice

stewart
was
is
it
there
is
some

that
