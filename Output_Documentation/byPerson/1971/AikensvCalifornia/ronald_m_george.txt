mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
will
try
to
anticipate
the
remainder
of
professor
amsterdam's
argument
just
to
follow
on
that
case.
the
basic
issue
before
the
court
is
of
course
not
whether
the
death
penalty
is
socially,
morally,
or
politically
desirable
or
advantageous
but
instead,
whether
there
is
some
specific
provisions
in
federal
constitution
that
bars
the
people
of
the
state
of
california,
in
this
case
from
determining
through
their
elected
representative,
that
for
death
penalty
should
be
available
as
a
possible
form
punishment
would
be
offense
of
murder.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes,
i
certainly
do
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
we
have
summarized
in
very
short
manner
that
the
case
have
reached
the
california
supreme
court
in
the
last
six
years,
well,
since
1965,
we
also
have
certain
table
in
our
brief
indicating
the
ratio
make
up
of
the
persons
receiving
death
sentences
or
rather
who
are
on
death
row
now
and
also
some
data
regarding
their
social
economic
status
and
we
will
get
into
that
in
some
detail.
the
petitioner
comes
here
bearing
indeed
a
heavy
burden
that
of
establishing
that
the
california
legislature
lacks
any
permissible
basis
upon
which
to
conclude
that
the
protection
of
the
society
requires
the
availability
of
the
death
penalty
for
the
most
serious
of
crimes,
the
willful
and
malicious
taking
of
human
life,
that
is
the
punishment
of
death.
a
form
of
punishment
is
all
that
the
history
of
man
itself.
now,
professor
amsterdam
takes
the
position
at
least
he
did
10
ago
when
he
and
i
were
before
the
california
supreme
court
on
the
very
same
issue
here
that
even
if
it
could
conclusively
be
established
that
the
death
penalty
does
deter
and
it
saves
innocent
peoples
lives
thereby
that
the
death
penalty
would
still
be
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
that
it
would
be
an
impermissible
form
of
punishment.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well,
the
one
qualification
on
my
remark
or
one
explanation
would
be
that
of
course
the
execution
will
have
to
be
done
in
a
humane
manner
and—what
i
would
like
to
develop
at
some
length
is
this
court’s
treatment
of
the
concept
of
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
i
think
one
of
the
key
aspects
of
cruel.
the
term
as
defined
from
the
wilkerson
case
through
francis
versus
restwaiver
is
the
definition
of
cruelty
in
terms
of
unnecessary
cruelty,
unnecessary
pain,
the
want
and
infliction
of
pain.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no,
unnecessary
cruelty
i
think.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
if
rational
people
could
so
conclude,
i
think
that
the
enactment
of
the
eight
amendment
was
intended
to
bar
certain
torture
of
punishment
and
i
do
not
think
that
capital
punishment
and
tortures
have
the
standards
altogether
just
because
they
do
both
existed
in
1791.
and
i
think
we
start
with
the
proposition
that
the
death
penalty
is
clearly
constitutional
during
the
period
in
which
the
eight
amendment
was
adopted,
your
honor
pointed
out
there
is
specific
mention
in
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
taking
of
life,
capital
offense
and
of
course
there
were
capital
offenses
enacted
both
in
the
federal
government
and
the
state
legislatures
immediately
preceding
and
following
the
adoption
of
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment,
so
one
must
ask
rhetorically
can
the
constitution
be
unconstitutional.
and
it
is
the
recognition
of
capital
offenses
and
the
taking
of
taking
of
life.
now
over
the
years--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
some
scholars
particularly
the
article
that
we
cited
by
mr.
branuchi,
seemed
to
indicate
that
there
was
a
very
definite
lack
of
precision
and
it
uses
the
term
that
they
might
have
meant
something
different
at
the
time
that
they
were
first
adopted
and
threatened
and
why
is
it
mistaken
to
mean
something
different
at
the
time
they
were
used.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
think
that
cruel
and
unusual
means
two
things
basically
as
defined
by
this
court's
opinion
trying
to
synthesize
the
various
opinion
from
wilkerson
in
1878
to
francis
versus
restriver
weiver
in
1947
and
that
is
as
follows
that
a
punishment
will
be
held
unconstitutional
as
it
is
both
true
on
unusual
either
have
first
a
punishment
inherently
cruel
and
inherently
unusual
in
its
form.
now,
wilkerson
as
i
stated
speak
in
terms
of
punishment
of
torture
and
all
others
involving
unnecessary
cruelty.
now,
this
was
cited
with
approval
in
henry
camler
which
decision
added
the
definition
that
punishments
are
cruel
where
they
involve
torture
or
a
lingering
death
but
the
punishment
of
death
is
not
itself
cruel,
cruelty
implies
something
barbarous
more
than
the
extinguishment
of
life.
now,
in
wing,
this
court
quoted
with
proof
of
oath.
the
wilkerson
definition
and
the
language
from
hemler
and
then
in
francis
versus
restweiver
preceded
to
define
cruelty
in
terms
of
the
infliction
of
walton
or
unnecessary
pain
and
said
the
cruelty
against
which
the
constitution
protects
the
convicted
man
is
cruelty
inherent
in
the
method
of
punishment.
not
too
necessary
surfing
involved
in
any
method
employed
to
extinguish
life
humanely.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
in
unusual,
i
think
what
we
mean
in
and
unusual
is
something
that
is
not
customary
for
that
height
of
offense.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
as
of
1791
i
would
like
to
in
some
detail
a
deal
with
this
argument
as
professor
amsterdam
that
the
word
somehow
change
their
meaning
from
year
to
year.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
think
that
whatever
was
not
unusual
and
cruel,
there
might
have
been
certain
things
that
were
usual
in
1791
that
subject
of
cruel.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
think
that
the
two
concepts
are
intervention.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
get
unusual
in
there
because
i
think
that
it
was
not
customary
punishment
such
as
wing
that
is
a
very
good
example—it
was
a
punishment
less
than
life
perhaps
one
might
call
it
cruel
but
the
court
expressed
that
it
was
highly
unusual,
something
totally
out
of
the
keeping
with
our
concept
of
common
law
punishment,
it
involves
certain
civil
disabilities
and
find
for
white
collar
crime
and
change
the
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
believe
that
that
is
an
in
option
in
the
state
of
utah.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
am
not
sure
of
which
states
do
have
but
i
think
utah
even
has
shooting
as
an
option.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
is
right
and
it
think
that
the
terms—
mr.
ronald
m.
george
pardon
me.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
speak
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
we
are
not
talking
i
think
about
methods
of
execution.
we
are
talking
about
a
certain
kind
of
proportionality.
now,
there
maybe
certain
types
of
tortures
that
were
not
available
either
in
1791
and
that
does
not
mean
that
they
are
not
covered
but
i
think
basically
the
eight
amendment
was
intended
to
apply
against
the
same
types
of
things
in
1791
as
it
is
today
and
in
fact
as
recently
as
1958,
this
court
in
cope
v.
dallas
(ph)
regarded
that
the
death
penalty
has
been
employed
throughout
our
history
and
again
which
is
still
widely
accepted.
it
cannot
be
said
to
violate
the
constitutional
concept
of
cruelty.
the
court
noted
the
imprecision
certainly
in
the
use
of
those
words
that
i
think
that
through
its
opinion,
it
has
come
up
with
this
definition
i
gave
the
first
part
of
it,
the
second
principle
i
think
as
far
as
cruel
and
unusual
is
concerned
would
involve
punishment
that
is
not
inherently
cruel
and
unusual
in
its
form
but
it
is
unconstitutional
as
grossly
excessive
as
applied
either
to
in
relationship
to
the
seriousness
of
particular
offense
or
in
relationship
to
a
status
which
does
not
involve
an
un-compelled
act
such
as
it
was
involve
in
robinson
versus
california
case
and
i
think
that
these
tests
are
applied
for
the
offense
of
murder,
it
is
clear
that
there
is
no
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
certainly
under
our
humane
method
there
is
no
intentional
cruelty
and
in
fact
that
death
that
comes
to
such
a
prisoner
it
perhaps
frequently
less
cruel
than
the
death
by
natural
process
that
comes
to
us
all
eventually.
so—
mr.
ronald
m.
george
nobody
knows
but
with
the
state
of
our
medical
knowledge
today,
i
think
that
we
can
assume
that
since
death
comes
within
a
matter
of
second
that
whatever
might
be
the
physical
reflex
actions
that
professor
amsterdam
has
chosen.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
do
not
think
speed
is
the
only
criterion
apparently
according
to
medical
authority,
it
does
involve
less
pain
than
any
other
method
and
this
court
has
certainly
found
that
in
the
past
and
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
anything
that
petitioner
has
been
able
to
show
that
would
lead
us
to
believe
that
they
are
involve
--
it
involves
some
necessary
intentional
torturing.
the
test
is
whether
there
is
any
cruelty
beyond
the
threat,
all
punishment
is
cruel,
putting
a
man
behind
bars
might
be
cruel,
especially
for
life
but
that
is
not
the
test.
the
test
is
unnecessary
cruel.
now,
although
this
court
in
cope
v.
dallas
(ph)
went
out
of
its
way
to
uphold
the
constitutionality
of
the
death
penalty,
petitioner
ceases
upon
certain
language
than
opinion.
the
evolving
standards
of
decency
that
marked
a
progress
of
a
maturing
society
as
some
sort
of
talismanic
death
knell
to
300
years
of
capital
punishment.
those
words
did
represent
the
opinion
of
four
members
of
the
board
at
that
time,
one
member
of
who
makes
a
part
of
the
constituency
of
the
present
form
but
certainly,
the
meaning
of
cruel
and
unusual
is
not
static
but
we
emphasize
that
these
words
cannot
change
from
year
to
year.
i
do
not
know
if
professor
amsterdam
has
in
mind
the
meaning
of
cruel
and
unusual
in
1962
or
65
when
petitioner
committed
his
crime
or
1969
when
the
judgment
of
the
california
supreme
court
below
was
affirmed
or
1972
but
we
vigorously
rejected
a
notion
that
these
terms
cruel
and
unusual
can
change
affirmatively
from
year
to
year.
where
this
is
the
case,
indeed
our
evolving
standards
of
decency
might
regress.
as
they
did
in
germany
in
the
1940s
and
50s.
what
if
a
burning
in
oil
or
some
other
tortures
did
in
fact
become
a
popular
vote
in
the
mind
of
our
populous.
would
that
mean
that
they
were
suddenly
constitutional
under
a
fluid
and
meaningless
eight
amendment,
i
do
not
think
so
and
just
because
some
rather
primitive
corporal
punishments
were
in
use
at
the
time,
the
eight
amendment
was
enacted
does
not
mean
that
they
and
capital
punishment
stand
or
fall
together.
the
framers
of
the
eight
amendment
may
very
well
have
intended
to
outlaw
some
of
those
punishments
and
indeed
those
punishments
although
they
might
have
survived
some
time
after
the
enactment
of
the
eight
amendment
were
never
sanctified
as
constitutional
by
any
decision
of
this
court,
unlike
capital
punishment
with
method
of
inflictions,
at
least
have
been
sanctified.
and
there
was
never
any
sanctifying
of
tortures
in
the
constitution
as
there
is
a
capital
punishment
in
the
fifth
amendment
use
of
capital
offenses
and
its
use
of
taking
life.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no
but
i
do
not
think
that
is
what
the
framers
of
the
eight
amendment
attempts
to
sanctify
either,
i
think
they
were—
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
think
they
were
speaking
broadly
of
corporal
punishment
i
do
not
think
they
would
necessarily
mean
the
taking
off
of
the
limb,
i
think
they
would
mean
perhaps
certain
corporal
punishment
that
survives
and
that
might
survive
today
though.
i
do
think
that—
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
am
not
convinced
that
let
us
say
any
form
whipping
would
necessarily
be
unconstitutional,
20
lashes
for
maybe
murdering
somebody
might
not
be
unusual
today
i
certainly
do
not
think
it
would
be
and
that
is
perhaps
what
they
have
in
mind.
i
think
the
petitioner
therefore
is
quite
incorrect
in
stating
that
if
we
say
that
the
death
penalty
is
alright,
that
means
just
burning
in
oil
and
other
tortures
were
necessarily
alright
too.
now,
i
would
like
to
take
a
second
factor.
even
if
we
assume
that
the
meaning
of
cruel
and
unusual
can
change
from
decade
to
decade,
progress
and
perhaps
regret
i
would
submit
that
our
standards
have
not
evolved
to
the
point
where
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
could
be
the
offensive
murder,
in
inconsistent
with
our
standards.
i
do
not
know
what
is
change
from
1791
or
since
the
1958
decision
of
this
court
in
cope
v.
dallas
(ph)
to
alter
the
fact
that
capital
punishment
is
part
of
our
moral
and
religious
and
philosophical
heritage
and
has
always
been
recognized
as
such
and
indeed
professor
amsterdam's
fixation
with
that
phrase
evolving
standards
is
quite
understandable,
as
it
provides
the
only
arguable
escape
from
the
historical
reality
of
capital
punishment
being
recognized
that
the
legitimate
form
of
punishment,
300
years
in
this
nation
and
thousands
of
years
in
our
heritage.
now,
it
is
not
clear
again
at
which
point
that
petitioner
wants
us
to
focus
on
in
determining
the
standard
but
one
thing
is
clear
he
conveniently
chooses
to
ignore
the
fact
if
41
of
our
50
state
have
capital
punishment
that
federal
government
does
that
eight
states
have
exempted
with
abolition
of
the
death
penalty
and
rejected
it.
the
fact
that
there
was
widespread
support
to
the
death
penalty,
if
not
confined
to
bill
editors,
prosecutors
or
eventual
police
officers.
we
cited
religious
authorities
to
think
that
capital
punishment
is
permissible.
the
polls
certainly
show
a
majority
of
our
population
in
favor
but
also
ignored
is
the
almost
annual
ritual
in
the
california
legislature
and
by
which
a
bill
is
produce
to
abolish
the
death
penalty
and
the
exempt
defeated
usually
in
committee
sometimes
on
the
floor.
also
ignored
as
the
fact
that
the
california
legislature
in
1970
added
a
new
capital
offense.
federal
government
did
in
1961
and
65.
so
what
does
professor
amsterdam
choose
to
focus
his
attention
on.
he
cites
at
great
length
in
his
brief
what
(inaudible)
are
doing.
what
relevance
does
this
have
to
determine
what
are
provisions
adopted
in
79-1791
means
with
reference
to
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
different
countries
have
different
social
conditions,
necessitating
different
forms
of
punishment.
keeping
in
mind
their
own
needs
for
the
protection
of
their
society
and
most
significantly
non
of
those
nations
have
abolished
the
death
penalty
judicially,
none
to
my
knowledge.
petitioner
fails
to
even
show
any
trends
in
this
regard.
there
have
not
seen
in
recent
years
a
great
flurry
of
jurisdiction
to
rejecting
capital
punishment.
to
quote
professor
patter
this
is
not
a
time
for
due
process
by
head
count.
and
what
is
particularly
ridiculous
is
for
petitioner
in
his
brief
although
i
know
that
he
sort
of
abandoned
the
position
here
today
to
focus
upon
the
small
number
of
executions.
this
is
a
posed
indication
of
the
declining
popular
acceptance
of
the
death
penalty.
now,
at
most
the
number
of
execution
which
has
been
declining
is
an
indicator
perhaps
of
the
evolving
standards
of
our
judiciary,
you
chose
judicial
state
but
it
is
not
an
indication
of
the
popular
feeling,
much
more
accurate
parameter
of
the
evolving
standards
of
our
times.
the
juries
who
consistently
steadily
and
even
increasingly
in
california
are
returning
death
penalty
verdicts
and
i
think
this
is
key
because
and
there
were
36
in
1970.
a
prisoner
under
sentence
of
death
in
california.
and
the
key
thing
here
is
that
whitherspoon
teaches
us
one
of
the
most
important
function
any
jury
can
perform
in
making
a
selection
between
life
and
death
is
to
maintain
a
link
between
the
temporary
community
values
and
the
penal
system.
and
that
is
what
our
jury
system
is
doing.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
read
that
some
place
too
in
the
center
of
the
briefs.
i
do
not
agree
with
that
at
all.
i
do
not
think
that
has
to
assume
that
the
jury
violates
their
own,
and
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
any
basis
and
fact,
that
there
are
a
lot
of
allegations
made
by
professor
amsterdam,
that
fact
and
other
facts
that
i
think
was
not
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
do
not
agree
with
his
observation
on
that,
these
are
my
own
experience
or
anything
i
have
read
support
that
and
i
think
the
key
flaw
in
this
whole
approach
of
petitioners
to
the
evolving
standard
form
is
this
--
if
there
is
a
great
trend,
this
great
movement
away
from
capital
punishment
as
far
as
our
values
are
concerned
why
is
that
not
reflected
in
our
democratically
and
active
legislation.
why
is
it
that
41
states
have
chosen
to
--
even
now.
professor
amsterdam
would
have
you
believe
that
these
people
are
so
unpopular
that
nobody
is
going
to
act
on
their
behalf.
well,
i
do
not
think
that
is
the
case
bills
are
introduced
to
abolished
the
death
penalty
all
the
time.
in
fact
congress
will
often
act
at
the
behest
of
one
single
individual
perhaps
an
alien
subject
to
deportation
without
any
great
resources
and
will
enact
special
legislation
allowing
that
alien
to
stay
in
to
this
country.
we
all
know
of
such
bills.
so
there
some
such
situation
these
people
are
so
unpopular,
they
have
no
full
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
will
with
respect
to
the--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
will
put
it
on
this
level
with
all
due
respect
your
honor
as
far
as
the
ability
of
a
solitary
individual
whether
it
is
for
his
right
to
remain
in
the
country
or
his
right
to
remain
alive
he
get
legislation
enacted
for
his
benefit
under
our
democratic
process
of
government.
i
think
that
they
basically
what
professor
amsterdam
chooses
to
do
here
in
ignoring
all
these
indicias
of
the
popular
acceptance
of
the
death
penalty.
he
seeks
to
consider
himself,
some
sort
of
self
appointed
guardian
of
the
evolving
standards
of
decency.
he
and
his
co-counsel,
they
know
what
the
truth
is
and
we
are
wrong
they
have
to
prove
the
evolving
standards
and
all
this
other
indications
should
be
disregarded
i
think
in
his
opinion.
now,
i
also
object
when
it
comes
to
the
issue
of
burden
of
proof
to
petitioners
attitude
that
somehow
the
state
has
no
obligation
to
establish
affirmatively
that
there
is
some
aim
of
punishment
accomplished
by
the
death
penalty
that
would
not
be
served
equally
well
by
the
imposition
of
a
life
term.
i
do
not
think
that
this
is
the
question.
i
think
to
get
into
that
ticket
you
will
have
the
problem
of
deciding,
can
a
state
justify
that
a
life
term
without
possibility
of
parole,
and
i
think
that
life
will
not
--
that
life
accomplish
something
of
a
fixed
term
of
years,
prison
accomplished
something
that
(inaudible).
i
think
this
is
really
asking
this
court
to
become
a
super
legislature
on
a
federal
state
relationship.
now,
the
basis
of
petitioner's
argument
must
be
indeed
that
there
is
no
permissible
reason
for
the
legislature
been
to
conclude
that
there
is
a
permissible
aim
of
punishment
served
by
the
death
penalty
and
i
think
that
it
is
clear
that
a
reasonable
basis
does
exist
i
want
the
labor
at
length,
the
matter
that
we
set
forth
in
our
brief
in
great
detail.
obviously,
the
first
aim
of
punishment
rehabilitation
is
not
served
but
those
persons
have
been
found,
unread
a
bill
of
(inaudible)
as
aikens
is
according
to
unanimous
testimony
of
the
psychiatrist.
we
have
set
forth
evidence
of
deterrence.
our
burden
is
to
establish
deterrence
but
we
have
shown
that
there
is
a
reasonable
basis
upon
which
the
legislature
can
conclude
that
the
death
penalty
does
deter.
prisoners
have
made
statements
not
only
to
police
officers
but
to
reporters
or
to
each
other.
the
defendants
have
said
one
to
the
other
during
a
whole
of
that.
don't
shoot
the
victim
you
will
get
us
both
fried.
well,
there
is
a
man
who
is
alive
today
because
of
the
death
penalty
and
the
legislature
had
considered
these
things
and
the
opinion
of
the
state
supreme
court,
the
dissenting
justices
and
the
love
opinion
which
we
cite
relies
very
much
on
the
important
statistical
figures
which
professor
amsterdam
undissentingly
refers
to
it
anecdotal
impressions
of
law
enforcement.
he
would
like
to
have
you
believe,
his
authority
professor
perhaps
to
have
a
certain
bias,
but
to
disregard
some
of
this
pragmatic
information.
now,
i
would
submit
of
course
that
the
death
penalty
would
be
a
greater
deterrent
of
execution
were
being
carried
out.
in
fact,
the
rise
in
crime
rate
as
execution
stops
might
bail
that
out
although
i
do
not
choose
to
rest
our
position
on
statistics.
it
is
clear
that
the
third
aim
of
punishment
incapacitation
or
isolation
is
not
served
by
a
life
term.
prisoners
kill
fellow
prisoners,
guard,
they
escape,
they
are
out
on
parole.
i
think
that
retribution
is
something
that
can
be
considered
as
well.
now,
i
would
like
to
briefly
point
out
to
the
court
that
our
briefs
do
graphically
refute
the
statements
by
petitioners
that
there
is
discrimination
in
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
against
the
mentally
deficiently
uneducated
the
poor
ratio
minority.
figures
show
very
graphically
that
38%
of
the
first
degree
murder
convictions
were
poor
negroes
and
only
25%
of
those
got
first
degree
murder
convictions
who
received
the
death
penalty
were
negroes.
so
there
is
no
discrimination.
it
is
difficult
to
understand
anything
discriminatory
and
what
professor
amsterdam
says
that
only
a
small
portion
of
condemned
murders
receive
the
death
penalty
would
he
prefer
that
they
all
do
it
discretion
were
abolished,
i
cannot
see
how
it
is
unfair
that
the
mass
killers
like
the
manson
family,
political
assassins
like
sirhan
and
a
three
time
killer
like
aikens
receives
the
death
penalty
and
some
people
do
not
and
receive
only
life.
now,
in
conclusion,
i
would
like
to
state,
petitioners
offered
us
no
objective
standard
for
what
is
cruel
and
unusual.
he
would
have
this
court
become
a
super
legislature
to
enact
his
own
personal
views
of
what
the
evolving
standards
of
our
society
should
be.
make
no
showing
regarding
the
supposed
lack
of
protection
afforded
by
the
death
penalty
and
if
his
argument
were
to
prevail,
indeed
many
persons
might
lose
their
lives
innocently
because
of
the
removal
of
the
protection
of
the
death
penalty.
i
do
not
have
to
dwell
at
length
upon
mr.
aiken's
crimes.
they
are
concededly
by
petitioner
terribly
brutal
no
remorse,
no
mental
problem.
he
was
intelligent,
having
education
but
he
committed
three
brutal
murders.
so
in
effect
what
i
would
close
with
is
the
statement
of
justice
homes
in
the
jackman
case.
if
a
thing
has
been
practiced
for
200
years
with
common
consent
will
lead
strong
case
for
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
effect
it
and
respondent
submits
that
petitioner
has
not
made
a
strong
case.
he
has
made
no
case
at
all.
respondent
joins
the
comment
that
we
quoted
of
justice
shower,
former
justice
of
the
california
supreme
court
has
all
of
us
involved
in
the
whole
process
of
the
death
penalty.
even
if
the
appellate
level
to
validly
wish
that
the
death
penalty
were
no
longer
necessary
but
we
have
not
yet
reached
that
utopian
state.
meanwhile
putting
aside
whatever
personal
feelings
we
might
have
nothing
has
happened
in
the
180
years
history
of
our
constitution
or
the
300
year
history
of
capital
punishment
in
this
country
which
would
preclude
the
people
of
the
various
states
from
even
considering
the
question,
from
concluding
that
society
protection
requires
the
availability
of
the
death
penalty
as
s
permissible
form
of
punishment
in
certain
of
our
most
aggravated
offenses
and
indeed
the
cases
that
we
have
set
forth
here
indicate
that
it
is
the
aggravated
offense
to
receive
the
death
penalty.
juries
are
being
discriminating,
not
discriminatory
and
petitioner
is
really
seeking
to
have
this
court
re-litigate
what
was
decided
only
last
year
in
the
mcgartha
issue.
so
with
that
plea,
that
we
consider
things
on
a
constitutional
level
without
the
emotional
rederick
of
political
personal
or
moral
feeling
such
as
to
the
desirability
for
death
penalty.
we
would
submit
that
the
judgement
should
be
affirmed
in
this
case
and
the
death
penalty
is
clearly
not
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
will
try
to
anticipate
the
remainder
of
professor
amsterdam's
argument
just
to
follow
on
that
case.
the
basic
issue
before
the
court
is
of
course
not
whether
the
death
penalty
is
socially,
morally,
or
politically
desirable
or
advantageous
but
instead,
whether
there
is
some
specific
provisions
in
federal
constitution
that
bars
the
people
of
the
state
of
california,
in
this
case
from
determining
through
their
elected
representative,
that
for
death
penalty
should
be
available
as
a
possible
form
punishment
would
be
offense
of
murder.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes,
i
certainly
do
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
we
have
summarized
in
very
short
manner
that
the
case
have
reached
the
california
supreme
court
in
the
last
six
years,
well,
since
1965,
we
also
have
certain
table
in
our
brief
indicating
the
ratio
make
up
of
the
persons
receiving
death
sentences
or
rather
who
are
on
death
row
now
and
also
some
data
regarding
their
social
economic
status
and
we
will
get
into
that
in
some
detail.
the
petitioner
comes
here
bearing
indeed
a
heavy
burden
that
of
establishing
that
the
california
legislature
lacks
any
permissible
basis
upon
which
to
conclude
that
the
protection
of
the
society
requires
the
availability
of
the
death
penalty
for
the
most
serious
of
crimes,
the
willful
and
malicious
taking
of
human
life,
that
is
the
punishment
of
death.
a
form
of
punishment
is
all
that
the
history
of
man
itself.
now,
professor
amsterdam
takes
the
position
at
least
he
did
10
ago
when
he
and
i
were
before
the
california
supreme
court
on
the
very
same
issue
here
that
even
if
it
could
conclusively
be
established
that
the
death
penalty
does
deter
and
it
saves
innocent
peoples
lives
thereby
that
the
death
penalty
would
still
be
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
that
it
would
be
an
impermissible
form
of
punishment.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well,
the
one
qualification
on
my
remark
or
one
explanation
would
be
that
of
course
the
execution
will
have
to
be
done
in
a
humane
manner
and—what
i
would
like
to
develop
at
some
length
is
this
court’s
treatment
of
the
concept
of
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
i
think
one
of
the
key
aspects
of
cruel.
the
term
as
defined
from
the
wilkerson
case
through
francis
versus
restwaiver
is
the
definition
of
cruelty
in
terms
of
unnecessary
cruelty,
unnecessary
pain,
the
want
and
infliction
of
pain.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no,
unnecessary
cruelty
i
think.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
if
rational
people
could
so
conclude,
i
think
that
the
enactment
of
the
eight
amendment
was
intended
to
bar
certain
torture
of
punishment
and
i
do
not
think
that
capital
punishment
and
tortures
have
the
standards
altogether
just
because
they
do
both
existed
in
1791.
and
i
think
we
start
with
the
proposition
that
the
death
penalty
is
clearly
constitutional
during
the
period
in
which
the
eight
amendment
was
adopted,
your
honor
pointed
out
there
is
specific
mention
in
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
taking
of
life,
capital
offense
and
of
course
there
were
capital
offenses
enacted
both
in
the
federal
government
and
the
state
legislatures
immediately
preceding
and
following
the
adoption
of
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment,
so
one
must
ask
rhetorically
can
the
constitution
be
unconstitutional.
and
it
is
the
recognition
of
capital
offenses
and
the
taking
of
taking
of
life.
now
over
the
years--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
some
scholars
particularly
the
article
that
we
cited
by
mr.
branuchi,
seemed
to
indicate
that
there
was
a
very
definite
lack
of
precision
and
it
uses
the
term
that
they
might
have
meant
something
different
at
the
time
that
they
were
first
adopted
and
threatened
and
why
is
it
mistaken
to
mean
something
different
at
the
time
they
were
used.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
think
that
cruel
and
unusual
means
two
things
basically
as
defined
by
this
court's
opinion
trying
to
synthesize
the
various
opinion
from
wilkerson
in
1878
to
francis
versus
restriver
weiver
in
1947
and
that
is
as
follows
that
a
punishment
will
be
held
unconstitutional
as
it
is
both
true
on
unusual
either
have
first
a
punishment
inherently
cruel
and
inherently
unusual
in
its
form.
now,
wilkerson
as
i
stated
speak
in
terms
of
punishment
of
torture
and
all
others
involving
unnecessary
cruelty.
now,
this
was
cited
with
approval
in
henry
camler
which
decision
added
the
definition
that
punishments
are
cruel
where
they
involve
torture
or
a
lingering
death
but
the
punishment
of
death
is
not
itself
cruel,
cruelty
implies
something
barbarous
more
than
the
extinguishment
of
life.
now,
in
wing,
this
court
quoted
with
proof
of
oath.
the
wilkerson
definition
and
the
language
from
hemler
and
then
in
francis
versus
restweiver
preceded
to
define
cruelty
in
terms
of
the
infliction
of
walton
or
unnecessary
pain
and
said
the
cruelty
against
which
the
constitution
protects
the
convicted
man
is
cruelty
inherent
in
the
method
of
punishment.
not
too
necessary
surfing
involved
in
any
method
employed
to
extinguish
life
humanely.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
in
unusual,
i
think
what
we
mean
in
and
unusual
is
something
that
is
not
customary
for
that
height
of
offense.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
as
of
1791
i
would
like
to
in
some
detail
a
deal
with
this
argument
as
professor
amsterdam
that
the
word
somehow
change
their
meaning
from
year
to
year.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
think
that
whatever
was
not
unusual
and
cruel,
there
might
have
been
certain
things
that
were
usual
in
1791
that
subject
of
cruel.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
think
that
the
two
concepts
are
intervention.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
get
unusual
in
there
because
i
think
that
it
was
not
customary
punishment
such
as
wing
that
is
a
very
good
example—it
was
a
punishment
less
than
life
perhaps
one
might
call
it
cruel
but
the
court
expressed
that
it
was
highly
unusual,
something
totally
out
of
the
keeping
with
our
concept
of
common
law
punishment,
it
involves
certain
civil
disabilities
and
find
for
white
collar
crime
and
change
the
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
believe
that
that
is
an
in
option
in
the
state
of
utah.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
am
not
sure
of
which
states
do
have
but
i
think
utah
even
has
shooting
as
an
option.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
is
right
and
it
think
that
the
terms—
mr.
ronald
m.
george
pardon
me.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
speak
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
we
are
not
talking
i
think
about
methods
of
execution.
we
are
talking
about
a
certain
kind
of
proportionality.
now,
there
maybe
certain
types
of
tortures
that
were
not
available
either
in
1791
and
that
does
not
mean
that
they
are
not
covered
but
i
think
basically
the
eight
amendment
was
intended
to
apply
against
the
same
types
of
things
in
1791
as
it
is
today
and
in
fact
as
recently
as
1958,
this
court
in
cope
v.
dallas
(ph)
regarded
that
the
death
penalty
has
been
employed
throughout
our
history
and
again
which
is
still
widely
accepted.
it
cannot
be
said
to
violate
the
constitutional
concept
of
cruelty.
the
court
noted
the
imprecision
certainly
in
the
use
of
those
words
that
i
think
that
through
its
opinion,
it
has
come
up
with
this
definition
i
gave
the
first
part
of
it,
the
second
principle
i
think
as
far
as
cruel
and
unusual
is
concerned
would
involve
punishment
that
is
not
inherently
cruel
and
unusual
in
its
form
but
it
is
unconstitutional
as
grossly
excessive
as
applied
either
to
in
relationship
to
the
seriousness
of
particular
offense
or
in
relationship
to
a
status
which
does
not
involve
an
un-compelled
act
such
as
it
was
involve
in
robinson
versus
california
case
and
i
think
that
these
tests
are
applied
for
the
offense
of
murder,
it
is
clear
that
there
is
no
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
certainly
under
our
humane
method
there
is
no
intentional
cruelty
and
in
fact
that
death
that
comes
to
such
a
prisoner
it
perhaps
frequently
less
cruel
than
the
death
by
natural
process
that
comes
to
us
all
eventually.
so—
mr.
ronald
m.
george
nobody
knows
but
with
the
state
of
our
medical
knowledge
today,
i
think
that
we
can
assume
that
since
death
comes
within
a
matter
of
second
that
whatever
might
be
the
physical
reflex
actions
that
professor
amsterdam
has
chosen.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
do
not
think
speed
is
the
only
criterion
apparently
according
to
medical
authority,
it
does
involve
less
pain
than
any
other
method
and
this
court
has
certainly
found
that
in
the
past
and
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
anything
that
petitioner
has
been
able
to
show
that
would
lead
us
to
believe
that
they
are
involve
--
it
involves
some
necessary
intentional
torturing.
the
test
is
whether
there
is
any
cruelty
beyond
the
threat,
all
punishment
is
cruel,
putting
a
man
behind
bars
might
be
cruel,
especially
for
life
but
that
is
not
the
test.
the
test
is
unnecessary
cruel.
now,
although
this
court
in
cope
v.
dallas
(ph)
went
out
of
its
way
to
uphold
the
constitutionality
of
the
death
penalty,
petitioner
ceases
upon
certain
language
than
opinion.
the
evolving
standards
of
decency
that
marked
a
progress
of
a
maturing
society
as
some
sort
of
talismanic
death
knell
to
300
years
of
capital
punishment.
those
words
did
represent
the
opinion
of
four
members
of
the
board
at
that
time,
one
member
of
who
makes
a
part
of
the
constituency
of
the
present
form
but
certainly,
the
meaning
of
cruel
and
unusual
is
not
static
but
we
emphasize
that
these
words
cannot
change
from
year
to
year.
i
do
not
know
if
professor
amsterdam
has
in
mind
the
meaning
of
cruel
and
unusual
in
1962
or
65
when
petitioner
committed
his
crime
or
1969
when
the
judgment
of
the
california
supreme
court
below
was
affirmed
or
1972
but
we
vigorously
rejected
a
notion
that
these
terms
cruel
and
unusual
can
change
affirmatively
from
year
to
year.
where
this
is
the
case,
indeed
our
evolving
standards
of
decency
might
regress.
as
they
did
in
germany
in
the
1940s
and
50s.
what
if
a
burning
in
oil
or
some
other
tortures
did
in
fact
become
a
popular
vote
in
the
mind
of
our
populous.
would
that
mean
that
they
were
suddenly
constitutional
under
a
fluid
and
meaningless
eight
amendment,
i
do
not
think
so
and
just
because
some
rather
primitive
corporal
punishments
were
in
use
at
the
time,
the
eight
amendment
was
enacted
does
not
mean
that
they
and
capital
punishment
stand
or
fall
together.
the
framers
of
the
eight
amendment
may
very
well
have
intended
to
outlaw
some
of
those
punishments
and
indeed
those
punishments
although
they
might
have
survived
some
time
after
the
enactment
of
the
eight
amendment
were
never
sanctified
as
constitutional
by
any
decision
of
this
court,
unlike
capital
punishment
with
method
of
inflictions,
at
least
have
been
sanctified.
and
there
was
never
any
sanctifying
of
tortures
in
the
constitution
as
there
is
a
capital
punishment
in
the
fifth
amendment
use
of
capital
offenses
and
its
use
of
taking
life.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no
but
i
do
not
think
that
is
what
the
framers
of
the
eight
amendment
attempts
to
sanctify
either,
i
think
they
were—
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
think
they
were
speaking
broadly
of
corporal
punishment
i
do
not
think
they
would
necessarily
mean
the
taking
off
of
the
limb,
i
think
they
would
mean
perhaps
certain
corporal
punishment
that
survives
and
that
might
survive
today
though.
i
do
think
that—
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
am
not
convinced
that
let
us
say
any
form
whipping
would
necessarily
be
unconstitutional,
20
lashes
for
maybe
murdering
somebody
might
not
be
unusual
today
i
certainly
do
not
think
it
would
be
and
that
is
perhaps
what
they
have
in
mind.
i
think
the
petitioner
therefore
is
quite
incorrect
in
stating
that
if
we
say
that
the
death
penalty
is
alright,
that
means
just
burning
in
oil
and
other
tortures
were
necessarily
alright
too.
now,
i
would
like
to
take
a
second
factor.
even
if
we
assume
that
the
meaning
of
cruel
and
unusual
can
change
from
decade
to
decade,
progress
and
perhaps
regret
i
would
submit
that
our
standards
have
not
evolved
to
the
point
where
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
could
be
the
offensive
murder,
in
inconsistent
with
our
standards.
i
do
not
know
what
is
change
from
1791
or
since
the
1958
decision
of
this
court
in
cope
v.
dallas
(ph)
to
alter
the
fact
that
capital
punishment
is
part
of
our
moral
and
religious
and
philosophical
heritage
and
has
always
been
recognized
as
such
and
indeed
professor
amsterdam's
fixation
with
that
phrase
evolving
standards
is
quite
understandable,
as
it
provides
the
only
arguable
escape
from
the
historical
reality
of
capital
punishment
being
recognized
that
the
legitimate
form
of
punishment,
300
years
in
this
nation
and
thousands
of
years
in
our
heritage.
now,
it
is
not
clear
again
at
which
point
that
petitioner
wants
us
to
focus
on
in
determining
the
standard
but
one
thing
is
clear
he
conveniently
chooses
to
ignore
the
fact
if
41
of
our
50
state
have
capital
punishment
that
federal
government
does
that
eight
states
have
exempted
with
abolition
of
the
death
penalty
and
rejected
it.
the
fact
that
there
was
widespread
support
to
the
death
penalty,
if
not
confined
to
bill
editors,
prosecutors
or
eventual
police
officers.
we
cited
religious
authorities
to
think
that
capital
punishment
is
permissible.
the
polls
certainly
show
a
majority
of
our
population
in
favor
but
also
ignored
is
the
almost
annual
ritual
in
the
california
legislature
and
by
which
a
bill
is
produce
to
abolish
the
death
penalty
and
the
exempt
defeated
usually
in
committee
sometimes
on
the
floor.
also
ignored
as
the
fact
that
the
california
legislature
in
1970
added
a
new
capital
offense.
federal
government
did
in
1961
and
65.
so
what
does
professor
amsterdam
choose
to
focus
his
attention
on.
he
cites
at
great
length
in
his
brief
what
(inaudible)
are
doing.
what
relevance
does
this
have
to
determine
what
are
provisions
adopted
in
79-1791
means
with
reference
to
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
different
countries
have
different
social
conditions,
necessitating
different
forms
of
punishment.
keeping
in
mind
their
own
needs
for
the
protection
of
their
society
and
most
significantly
non
of
those
nations
have
abolished
the
death
penalty
judicially,
none
to
my
knowledge.
petitioner
fails
to
even
show
any
trends
in
this
regard.
there
have
not
seen
in
recent
years
a
great
flurry
of
jurisdiction
to
rejecting
capital
punishment.
to
quote
professor
patter
this
is
not
a
time
for
due
process
by
head
count.
and
what
is
particularly
ridiculous
is
for
petitioner
in
his
brief
although
i
know
that
he
sort
of
abandoned
the
position
here
today
to
focus
upon
the
small
number
of
executions.
this
is
a
posed
indication
of
the
declining
popular
acceptance
of
the
death
penalty.
now,
at
most
the
number
of
execution
which
has
been
declining
is
an
indicator
perhaps
of
the
evolving
standards
of
our
judiciary,
you
chose
judicial
state
but
it
is
not
an
indication
of
the
popular
feeling,
much
more
accurate
parameter
of
the
evolving
standards
of
our
times.
the
juries
who
consistently
steadily
and
even
increasingly
in
california
are
returning
death
penalty
verdicts
and
i
think
this
is
key
because
and
there
were
36
in
1970.
a
prisoner
under
sentence
of
death
in
california.
and
the
key
thing
here
is
that
whitherspoon
teaches
us
one
of
the
most
important
function
any
jury
can
perform
in
making
a
selection
between
life
and
death
is
to
maintain
a
link
between
the
temporary
community
values
and
the
penal
system.
and
that
is
what
our
jury
system
is
doing.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
read
that
some
place
too
in
the
center
of
the
briefs.
i
do
not
agree
with
that
at
all.
i
do
not
think
that
has
to
assume
that
the
jury
violates
their
own,
and
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
any
basis
and
fact,
that
there
are
a
lot
of
allegations
made
by
professor
amsterdam,
that
fact
and
other
facts
that
i
think
was
not
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
do
not
agree
with
his
observation
on
that,
these
are
my
own
experience
or
anything
i
have
read
support
that
and
i
think
the
key
flaw
in
this
whole
approach
of
petitioners
to
the
evolving
standard
form
is
this
--
if
there
is
a
great
trend,
this
great
movement
away
from
capital
punishment
as
far
as
our
values
are
concerned
why
is
that
not
reflected
in
our
democratically
and
active
legislation.
why
is
it
that
41
states
have
chosen
to
--
even
now.
professor
amsterdam
would
have
you
believe
that
these
people
are
so
unpopular
that
nobody
is
going
to
act
on
their
behalf.
well,
i
do
not
think
that
is
the
case
bills
are
introduced
to
abolished
the
death
penalty
all
the
time.
in
fact
congress
will
often
act
at
the
behest
of
one
single
individual
perhaps
an
alien
subject
to
deportation
without
any
great
resources
and
will
enact
special
legislation
allowing
that
alien
to
stay
in
to
this
country.
we
all
know
of
such
bills.
so
there
some
such
situation
these
people
are
so
unpopular,
they
have
no
full
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
will
with
respect
to
the--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
will
put
it
on
this
level
with
all
due
respect
your
honor
as
far
as
the
ability
of
a
solitary
individual
whether
it
is
for
his
right
to
remain
in
the
country
or
his
right
to
remain
alive
he
get
legislation
enacted
for
his
benefit
under
our
democratic
process
of
government.
i
think
that
they
basically
what
professor
amsterdam
chooses
to
do
here
in
ignoring
all
these
indicias
of
the
popular
acceptance
of
the
death
penalty.
he
seeks
to
consider
himself,
some
sort
of
self
appointed
guardian
of
the
evolving
standards
of
decency.
he
and
his
co-counsel,
they
know
what
the
truth
is
and
we
are
wrong
they
have
to
prove
the
evolving
standards
and
all
this
other
indications
should
be
disregarded
i
think
in
his
opinion.
now,
i
also
object
when
it
comes
to
the
issue
of
burden
of
proof
to
petitioners
attitude
that
somehow
the
state
has
no
obligation
to
establish
affirmatively
that
there
is
some
aim
of
punishment
accomplished
by
the
death
penalty
that
would
not
be
served
equally
well
by
the
imposition
of
a
life
term.
i
do
not
think
that
this
is
the
question.
i
think
to
get
into
that
ticket
you
will
have
the
problem
of
deciding,
can
a
state
justify
that
a
life
term
without
possibility
of
parole,
and
i
think
that
life
will
not
--
that
life
accomplish
something
of
a
fixed
term
of
years,
prison
accomplished
something
that
(inaudible).
i
think
this
is
really
asking
this
court
to
become
a
super
legislature
on
a
federal
state
relationship.
now,
the
basis
of
petitioner's
argument
must
be
indeed
that
there
is
no
permissible
reason
for
the
legislature
been
to
conclude
that
there
is
a
permissible
aim
of
punishment
served
by
the
death
penalty
and
i
think
that
it
is
clear
that
a
reasonable
basis
does
exist
i
want
the
labor
at
length,
the
matter
that
we
set
forth
in
our
brief
in
great
detail.
obviously,
the
first
aim
of
punishment
rehabilitation
is
not
served
but
those
persons
have
been
found,
unread
a
bill
of
(inaudible)
as
aikens
is
according
to
unanimous
testimony
of
the
psychiatrist.
we
have
set
forth
evidence
of
deterrence.
our
burden
is
to
establish
deterrence
but
we
have
shown
that
there
is
a
reasonable
basis
upon
which
the
legislature
can
conclude
that
the
death
penalty
does
deter.
prisoners
have
made
statements
not
only
to
police
officers
but
to
reporters
or
to
each
other.
the
defendants
have
said
one
to
the
other
during
a
whole
of
that.
don't
shoot
the
victim
you
will
get
us
both
fried.
well,
there
is
a
man
who
is
alive
today
because
of
the
death
penalty
and
the
legislature
had
considered
these
things
and
the
opinion
of
the
state
supreme
court,
the
dissenting
justices
and
the
love
opinion
which
we
cite
relies
very
much
on
the
important
statistical
figures
which
professor
amsterdam
undissentingly
refers
to
it
anecdotal
impressions
of
law
enforcement.
he
would
like
to
have
you
believe,
his
authority
professor
perhaps
to
have
a
certain
bias,
but
to
disregard
some
of
this
pragmatic
information.
now,
i
would
submit
of
course
that
the
death
penalty
would
be
a
greater
deterrent
of
execution
were
being
carried
out.
in
fact,
the
rise
in
crime
rate
as
execution
stops
might
bail
that
out
although
i
do
not
choose
to
rest
our
position
on
statistics.
it
is
clear
that
the
third
aim
of
punishment
incapacitation
or
isolation
is
not
served
by
a
life
term.
prisoners
kill
fellow
prisoners,
guard,
they
escape,
they
are
out
on
parole.
i
think
that
retribution
is
something
that
can
be
considered
as
well.
now,
i
would
like
to
briefly
point
out
to
the
court
that
our
briefs
do
graphically
refute
the
statements
by
petitioners
that
there
is
discrimination
in
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
against
the
mentally
deficiently
uneducated
the
poor
ratio
minority.
figures
show
very
graphically
that
38%
of
the
first
degree
murder
convictions
were
poor
negroes
and
only
25%
of
those
got
first
degree
murder
convictions
who
received
the
death
penalty
were
negroes.
so
there
is
no
discrimination.
it
is
difficult
to
understand
anything
discriminatory
and
what
professor
amsterdam
says
that
only
a
small
portion
of
condemned
murders
receive
the
death
penalty
would
he
prefer
that
they
all
do
it
discretion
were
abolished,
i
cannot
see
how
it
is
unfair
that
the
mass
killers
like
the
manson
family,
political
assassins
like
sirhan
and
a
three
time
killer
like
aikens
receives
the
death
penalty
and
some
people
do
not
and
receive
only
life.
now,
in
conclusion,
i
would
like
to
state,
petitioners
offered
us
no
objective
standard
for
what
is
cruel
and
unusual.
he
would
have
this
court
become
a
super
legislature
to
enact
his
own
personal
views
of
what
the
evolving
standards
of
our
society
should
be.
make
no
showing
regarding
the
supposed
lack
of
protection
afforded
by
the
death
penalty
and
if
his
argument
were
to
prevail,
indeed
many
persons
might
lose
their
lives
innocently
because
of
the
removal
of
the
protection
of
the
death
penalty.
i
do
not
have
to
dwell
at
length
upon
mr.
aiken's
crimes.
they
are
concededly
by
petitioner
terribly
brutal
no
remorse,
no
mental
problem.
he
was
intelligent,
having
education
but
he
committed
three
brutal
murders.
so
in
effect
what
i
would
close
with
is
the
statement
of
justice
homes
in
the
jackman
case.
if
a
thing
has
been
practiced
for
200
years
with
common
consent
will
lead
strong
case
for
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
effect
it
and
respondent
submits
that
petitioner
has
not
made
a
strong
case.
he
has
made
no
case
at
all.
respondent
joins
the
comment
that
we
quoted
of
justice
shower,
former
justice
of
the
california
supreme
court
has
all
of
us
involved
in
the
whole
process
of
the
death
penalty.
even
if
the
appellate
level
to
validly
wish
that
the
death
penalty
were
no
longer
necessary
but
we
have
not
yet
reached
that
utopian
state.
meanwhile
putting
aside
whatever
personal
feelings
we
might
have
nothing
has
happened
in
the
180
years
history
of
our
constitution
or
the
300
year
history
of
capital
punishment
in
this
country
which
would
preclude
the
people
of
the
various
states
from
even
considering
the
question,
from
concluding
that
society
protection
requires
the
availability
of
the
death
penalty
as
s
permissible
form
of
punishment
in
certain
of
our
most
aggravated
offenses
and
indeed
the
cases
that
we
have
set
forth
here
indicate
that
it
is
the
aggravated
offense
to
receive
the
death
penalty.
juries
are
being
discriminating,
not
discriminatory
and
petitioner
is
really
seeking
to
have
this
court
re-litigate
what
was
decided
only
last
year
in
the
mcgartha
issue.
so
with
that
plea,
that
we
consider
things
on
a
constitutional
level
without
the
emotional
rederick
of
political
personal
or
moral
feeling
such
as
to
the
desirability
for
death
penalty.
we
would
submit
that
the
judgement
should
be
affirmed
in
this
case
and
the
death
penalty
is
clearly
not
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
