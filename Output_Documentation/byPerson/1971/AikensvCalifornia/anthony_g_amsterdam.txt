mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
and
the
three
cases
to
follow,
present
the
question
whether
the
infliction
of
the
penalty
of
death
on
each
of
the
petitioners.
there
is
a
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
within
the
eight
and
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution.
the
cases
present
a
range
of
factual
situations.
in
this
first
aikens
case,
the
death
penalty
was
inflicted
upon
a
multiple
murderer
for
an
intentional
killing
of
the
particularly
atrocious
sort.
in
the
second
case,
the
furman
case,
we
have
a
killing
in
the
course
of
the
burglary
murder
which
may
or
may
not
have
been
intentional
and
it
is
not
attended
by
the
same
aggravating
circumstances
and
in
the
third
and
fourth
cases
jackson
and
branch,
we
have
the
infliction
of
the
death
penalty
for
the
crime
of
rape.
the
briefs
of
the
parties
and
of
the
amici
canvas
a
broad
range
of
considerations
under
the
eight
and
fourteenth
amendments.
but
i
think
there
are
mergers
from
the
briefs,
the
clear
impression
that
the
central
issue
in
this
case,
the
real
nerve
of
this
controversy,
is
the
scope
and
indeed
the
propriety
of
judicial
review
of
legislatives,
state
legislative
determinations
to
use
the
penalty
of
death.
the
briefs
on
behalf
of
the
respondents
primarily
support
the
death
penalty
on
the
ground
that
it
exists
on
the
statute
books
of
41
states
and
of
the
federal
government.
and
that
it
has
been
put
there
by
the
legislatures
of
41
states
in
the
federal
government
and
that
those
legislatures
are
the
primary
keepers
of
the
national
conscience
in
penal
matters.
and
the
elected
representatives
of
the
people
whose
judgment
is
entitled
to
respect.
i
agree
with
all
of
that,
but
for
me
i
think
that
is
the
beginning
and
not
the
end
of
analysis
under
the
eight
amendment
because
judicial
review
of
legislative
judgment
is
just
as
inevitable
as
it
is
difficult.
under
a
constitution
which
commits
to
the
courts,
protection
of
the
individual
under
guarantee
such
as
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
or
due
process
or
equal
protection
of
the
laws,
precisely
because
these
guarantees
are
fundamental
statements
of
the
most
basic
principles
of
our
society.
the
least
conferring
to
the
narrow
historical
circumstances
that
gave
them
birth.
they
are
cast
in
general
terms
their
generality
makes
them
difficult
to
interpret
and
it
also
creates
the
risk
which
mr.
justice
frankfurter
frequently
warned
the
court
about
that
the
court
may
read
its
own
dispositions
in
the
constitution.
but
at
the
same
time,
these
very
general
prescriptions
or
the
bedrock
of
a
constitution
designed
to
endure
for
time
and
to
give
continuing
and
constant
expression
to
the
notion
that
there
are
limitations
on
the
power
of
government
to
deal
with
individuals.
guarantee
such
as
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
and
due
process
and
equal
protection
are
broad
statements
in
grand
form,
cash
for
an
unforeseeable
future
and
intended
to
be
construed
to
give
continuing
protection
to
limitations
upon
governmental
power.
such
protections
to
the
individual
are
not
likely
often
to
be
added
to
the
constitution
by
the
amending
process
because
when
they
most
needed
they
are
least
likely
to
commend
the
political
approval
necessary
to
add
so
they
are
put
in
general
form
and
they
are
committed
the
courts
to
construe
as
times
change
during
the
life
of
the
nation
and
visit
by
the
constitution.
i
conclude
from
that
that
although
difference
and
circumspection
the
legislative
judgment
is
vital.
that
abnegation
of
judicial,
the
legislative
judgment
is
impermissible
because
the
very
existence
of
a
clause
like
the
eight
amendment
prohibition
of
cruel
and
unusual
punishment,
belies
the
idea
that
legislatures
are
totally
free
in
their
choice
of
penalogic
methods.
the
important
thing
is
plain.
it
is
that
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
clause
is
a
restriction
on
legislation.
in
the
context
of
american
government
where
penal
sanctions
are
primarily
legislative.
it
can
only
have
meant
to
limit
legislative
means
and
this
court
has
in
fact
pretty
times
appied
it
to
invalidate
legislation
and
the
only
cases
and
fact
in
which
it
has
applied
the
clause
to
vindicate
any
plan.
the
question
is
what
are
those
limitations
on
legislative
judgment?
how
stringent
are
they?
where
does
this
court
get
the
standards
by
which
to
determine?
the
problem
of
standards
is
critical
because
of
the
generality
of
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
that
i
described.
the
language
is
not
crystalline
it
is
not
clear
you
cannot
look
at
the
punishment
and
see
whether
the
cruel
you
cannot
look
at
it
to
see
whether
it
is
unusual.
and
history
although
relevant
cannot
be
controlling
because
of
the
evolutionary
nature
of
the
guarantee
and
its
projection
into
the
future
as
i
described.
the
state
of
california,
state
of
georgia
and
texas
to
some
extent
in
their
briefs
have
all
made
the
point
that
at
the
time
of
the
eight
amendment
was
written,
capital
punishment
was
widely
used.
the
fifth
amendment
clearly
envisages
that
there
will
be
capital
cases.
the
federal
congress
put
capital
statutes
on
the
books.
all
of
these
misconceived
i
think
our
submission
to
the
court
which
is
not
that
when
the
eight
amendment
was
ratified
in
1791
it
was
intended
then
and
there
to
do
with
capital
punishment,
anymore
than
it
was
intended
then
and
there
to
do
away
with
whippings
or
brandings
or
cutting
off
the
beers
or
anymore
than
equal
protection
clause
when
originally
put
in
to
the
constitution,
it
is
intended
to
give
equal
rights
to
indigents
or
to
women.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
would
congress
have
the
power
to
prohibit
the
death
penalty
under
the
eight
amendment?
oh!
surely
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
in
the
state,
yes
your
honor
but
we
go
further
than
that
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
with
regard
to
capital
punishment
in
the
state?
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no
your
honor
there
has
been
bills
submitted
by
a
senator
hart,
congressman
seller
which
would
impose
a
moratorium
on
execution.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
it
has
not
even
come
to
committee
hearing,
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that
is
correct
mr.
stewart.
the
problem
of
construing
the
eight
amendment
emerges
i
think
from
what
i
have
said
that
if
the
language
isn't
clear
and
if
history
is
not
controlled
where
does
the
court
get
standards,
where
does
it
find
the
basis
for
judgment
in
determining
whether
legislation
is
cruel
and
unusual.
the
primary
problem
with
formulations,
that
you
frequently
find
in
lard
port
cases
such
as
announcement
of
punishment
may
shot
the
conscience
of
the
court
or
be
unnecessarily
cruel
or
some
such
thing
in
that
in
wide
subjective
judgment
and
one
thing
i
think
all
the
parties
here
may
your
honor,
it
is
not
the
purpose
of
the
constitution
to
allow
the
judges
to
write
their
own
penalogical
reflections
into
it.
the
arguments
made
by
the
state
in
these
case
to
sustain
capital
punishment,
would
i
think
equally
sustain
branding
of
confidence
meant
on
the
forehead
with
the
letter
c
or
cutting
the
hands
off
the
pickpockets
or
any
atrocious
punishments.
and
these
punishments
i
think
would
plainly
be
condemned
by
the
eight
amendment
but
it
beholds
us
to
ask
why.
is
it
simply
because
we
would
be
shocked,
we
would
be
in
testimony
uphold
to
those
punishments
more
than
the
punishment
of
death,
if
they
are.
i
do
not
think
so;
i
think
it
is
because
there
are
objective
and
judicially
cognizable
basis
for
making
a
determination
under
the
eight
amendment.
and
in
our
brief
we
have
tried
to
set
forth
what
are
those
standards,
what
those
objective
standard
for
judicial
judgement
are?
specifically
we
think
that
the
question
under
the
eight
amendment
is
whether
the
punishment
applied
to
a
particular
individual
would
by
all
available
objective
indications
be
unacceptable
to
general,
contemporary,
conscience
and
standards
of
decency.
it
if
were
generally
and
uniformly
applied
to
any
reasonable
proportion
of
persons
subject
to
penalty
for
that
crime.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that
is
true
mr.
justice
douglas,
that
is
true
in
all
for
these
cases
that
the
death
penalty
is
discretionary
with
either
judge
or
jury
depending
on
who
tries
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
each
of
the
four.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no
indeed
the
state
policy
is
simply
that
the
penalty
of
death
be
available
not
that
it
be
imposed
on
any
particular
murder
or
any
particular
class
of
murder.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
there
is
nothing
in
this
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
nor
indeed
in
the
record
of
any
of
the
cases
before
the
court
which
discloses
that.
judicially
noticeable
findings
i
believe
set
out
in
our
brief
reflect
with
some
in
precision.
those
factors
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
supports
and
the
state
of
california
has
thrown
into
which
brief
they
could
deal
of
material
which
is
neither
in
the
record
nor
judicial
noticeable.
there
are
some
published
materials
such
as
the
racial
statistics,
which
i
think
our
judicially
noticeable
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
mr.
justice
douglas
on
that.
the
reason
why
we
urge
that
the
standard
i
just
described
is
a
proper
standard
under
the
eight
amendment.
what
this
court
must
do?
is
to
look
and
see
whether
the
punishment
inflicted
in
a
particular
case
would
be
tolerable,
acceptable
to
prevailing
standards
to
decency
generally
applied.
is
the
essentially
treatable
i
have
three
considerations
commend
that
standard
to
the
court.
and
i
should
say
i
take
the
court's
time
at
this
point
to
talk
about
the
eight
amendment
standard
because
this
court
has
very
little
developed
theory
and
a
concept
to
the
eight
amendment.
and
the
parties
are
i
think
more
in
disagreement
about
the
theory
of
the
eight
amendment
and
they
are
about
any
other
aspect
to
the
case.
any
good
three
reasons
to
this;
first
of
all
our
conception
of
the
theory
of
the
eight
amendment
picks
appropriate
count
of
the
different
nature
and
the
different
roles
under
the
constitution
of
legislature
in
the
courts.
legislatures
are
not
primarily
concerned
with
the
application
of
penalties
in
this
particular
cases.
as
mr.
justice
douglas's
question
suggests
the
legislature
with
regard
to
capital
punishment
has
simply
said
the
death
an
available
penalty.
it
may
never
be
used;
it
may
rarely
and
infrequently
be
used.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
there
are
a
number
of
them
left,
to
my
knowledge
s
there
is
only
one
capital
crime
in
the
united
state
in
which
there
are
any
men
on
death
row.
most
of
them
are
obsolete
such
as
prison
against
the
state
and
that
sort
of
thing
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
one
crime
is
the
california
crime.
4500
in
california
penal
crime
is
resolved
by
life
time
inmate
upon
non-inmate
where
the
person
assaulted
dies.
that
is
the
only
mandatory
capital
crime
as
to
which
i
know
there
is
anyone
on
death
row
at
this
standard.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
there
are
other
statutes
essentially
absolute
which
impose.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
oh
yes.
it
has
been
a
development
that
the
death
penalty
has
been
made
discretionary.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that
is
correct
there
is
no
state
yet
left
which
has
a
mandatory
capital
punishment
for
murder
or
rape
either
of
the
crimes
involved
here
or
any
other
of
the
ordinary
crimes
capital
punishments.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that
is
about
right.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
pardon
me.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that
is
correct.
the
district
of
columbia
and
new
york
were
the
last
two
in
the
united
states,
--
less
than
mandatory
--
a
capital
sentencing
provision.
the
second—
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
none
mr.
justice
douglas
it
is
entirely—
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
the
aikens
case
was
tried
and
sentencing
done
by
a
judge.
in
a
jury
tried
case
in
california,
the
trial
judge
may
set
aside
the
jury's
verdict.
the
california
supreme
court
may
not
review
the
sentence
whether
imposed
by
a
judge
or
jury.
the
second
reason
why
i
think
our
theory
or
standard
of
the
eight
amendment
commends
itself
to
the
court,
is
that
it
assigns
a
proper
function
to
the
eight
amendment
in
the
constitution
of
the
democracy
because
in
a
democracy
it
is
not
at
all
likely
that
the
legislature
will
put
on
to
the
statute
books
a
penalty
which
is
cruel,
which
is
unacceptable
to
public
conscience
in
a
generally
applicable
uniform
fashion.
a
stature
which
is
going
to
be
generally
applied,
which
would
be
repugnant
to
public
conscience
if
generally
applied
will
not
commend
enough
public
acceptance
to
get
on
the
statute
for
in
the
first
place.
the
problem
in
democracy
is
that
legislation
maybe
inactive
in
such
a
form,
that
it
can
be
arbitrarily,
selectively
spottily
applied
to
a
few
outcast
thrive,
whose
political
positions
are
so
weak
and
with
personal
situation
is
on
popular
and
were
so
ugly
that
public
revulsion
which
would
follow
the
uniform
application
of
the
penalties
applied
to
them,
does
not
follow
in
its
few
outcast
creatures
are
condemned
to
that
punishment.
what
we
are
saying
essentially
is
that
a
punishment
cast
in
a
form
so
that
it
can
be
used
this
way,
comes
to
the
court
suspect
under
the
eight
amendment
and
when
it
is
actually
applied
so
infrequently,
so
incredibly
relict
as
the
death
penalty
is
that
the
suspicion
materializes
and
the
penalty
is
identified
as
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
this
is
no
new
constitutional
conception.
i
am
really
saying
nothing
more
than
what
mr.
justice
stone
said
in
footnote
4
of
carolene
products
which
is
that
where
legislation
is
cast
in
the
form
such
as
unlikely
to
make
it
politically
remediable,
such
as
to
sterilize
the
ordinary
political
processes
that
keep
the
legislature
acting
decently
and
keep
legislation
reflective
of
the
public
conscience.
then
a
particular
obligation
devolves
on
the
court
to
assess
the
constitutionality
of
that
legislation.
the
third
reason
why
i
think
our
theory
of
the
eight
amendment
amends
itself
to
the
court.
is
that
it
does
not
imbibe
subjective
judicial
judgment.
it
does
not
ask
this
court
to
put
itself
in
the
position
of
super
legislature
and
decide
matters
of
penalogical
policy.
in
fact
our
theory,
i
believe
offers
the
only
alternative
to
subjective
judicial
judgment
because
if
one
looks
for
a
moment
at
the
grounds
on
which
the
state
seek
to
support
capital
punishment
that
it
is
the
retribution
of
the
permissible
legislative
aim
and
that
in
some
cases
retribution
requires
killing
people
that
deterrence
is
a
permissible
legislative
aim
and
legislature
could
find
the
capital
punishment
had
something
deterrent
efficacy.
you
immediately
see
that
the
same
arguments
could
and
that
would
be
made
if
the
legislature
for
fraud
boiling
in
oil
as
a
punishment
for
crime.
legislature
might
say
that
is
a
horrible
curse.
let
it
boiling
in
oil
if
they
do
that.
that
could
only
fit
retribution
for
that
crime
and
the
legislature
might
direct
at
an
awful
thing.
we
got
to
stop
that
and
the
only
way
to
really
make
it
a
horrible
and
prevent
this
from
doing
it
if
we
correct
them
in
boiling
in
an
oil.
boiling
in
oil
if
they
do
it.
and
the
state
could
be
able
to
make
essentially
same
arguments
that
they
are
making
here
against
capital
punishment.
in
favor
of
capital
punishment,
those
arguments
would
not
be
sustained
but
why
would
they
not
be
sustained,
is
it
because
boiling
in
an
oil
was
somehow
more
shocking
to
the
digestive
system,
to
the
intestinal
reaction
of
people
or
particular
judges
i
do
not
think
so.
i
think
it
is
because
an
objective
standards
which
we
invite
this
court
to
apply
the
capital
punishment
generally,
would
be
offended
by
boiling
in
oil.
and
i
think
it
is
offended
by
any
form
of
infliction
of

only
in
the
limited
sense
mr.

that
the

applies
the

of

in

there
is
not
within
the
scope
of

grant
of
certiorari
in
this
case
any

question
and
the
question
is
not
raised
below.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
think
i
agree,
i
think
it
is
more
than
a
semantic
problem,
i
think
it
is
a
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
yes
i
think
that
is
right
your
honor
but
i
think
there
is
a
difference
between
an
explicit
permission
and
simply
a
negative
inference
from
the
fact
that
there
are
certain
guarantees
that
say
that
if
the
death
penalty
is
to
be
imposed.
certain
procedures
must
be
followed,
there
must
be
a
grand
jury
indictment,
there
must
be
due
process
of
law.
i
do
not
think
that
one
can
say
that
the
language
in
the
constitution
which
by
inference
permits
a
death
penalty.
meant
to
project
a
continuing
permission
of
it
i
think
all
that
one
can
say
is
that
so
long
as
the
death
penalty
could
be
imposed
at
all
or
was
imposed
at
all,
it
could
only
be
imposed
within
these
restrictions
and
that
i
think
takes
us
back
to
the
initial
question.
i
do
not
think
and
i
am
not
urging
that
when
anybody
put
any
of
this
language
into
the
constitution,
they
meant
to
provoke
our
capital
punishment
i
think
it
what
they
meant
to
do
was
to
put
in
several
guarantees
of
rights.
one
guaranty
against
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
which
would
grow
and
involve
as
society
grew
and
involve.
another
is
the
guaranty
of
the
right
to
life,
liberty
and
property,
not
to
have
it
taken
away
without
due
process
of
law,
the
right
to
prosecution
by
indictment
and
that
sort
of
thing,
what
they
said
there
was
in
describing
what
a
legislature
could
not
do.
they
said
if
it
is
seeks
to
take
away
light,
the
only
inference
that
there
is
this—then
it
was
conceived
at
that
time
that
the
state
might
take
away
life.
it
can
only
do
it
by
these
procedure.
there
in
no
projection
forward
of
the
notion
that
the
taking
of
life
is
permissible.
they
is
simply
a
statement
that
we
know
now
that
the
taking
of
life
is
permissible
so
long
as
it
is
permissible,
these
guarantees
must
obtain.
i
think
there
is
no
inconsistency
in
that.
if
one
simply
recognize
the
historical
fact
that
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
clause
does
grow
and
evolve.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
a
last
point
that
i
think
is
that
some
significance
before
i
turn
to
the
capital
punishment
itself
is
that
our
theory
of
the
eight
amendment
is
also
without
historical
support.
the
eight
amendment
seems
to
advent
the
result
of
a
confluence
of
three
primary
concerns.
a
concern
against
the
excessive
punishments
which
you
see
in
english
laws
far
back
and
that
is
a
part
of
a
concern
against
the
selective
imposition
of
harsh
punishments,
and
a
concern
without
right
for
a
better.
the
most
immediately
relevant
one
i
think
is
the
second.
the
concern
against
the
selective
use
of
harsh
criminal
punishment
which
immediately
led
to
the
english
bill
of
rights
provision
in
1689,
that
is
now
the
language
of
the
eight
amendment.
the
english
bill
of
rights
provision
was
put
there
largely
as
a
result
of
the
(inaudible).
and
if
you
look
back
at
the
trial
of
vote,
what
you
see
is
that
the
actual
punishment
imposed
on
earth,
it
was
not
barbaric.
it
was
--
that
he
was
to
be
divested
as
a
clergy
man,
that
he
was
to
be
imprisoned
for
life
and
then
he
was
to
be
pilloried
and
whipped
annually
on
the
occasion
that
the
perjuries
because
of
his
conviction.
and
the
complaint
lodged
against
that
judgment
which
led
to
the
bill
of
rights
was
not
that
it
was
harsh
at
the
time
when
they
were
still
killing
thousands
of
people.
it
wasn't
intrinsically
barbaric,
it
was
it
was
selective.
one
fellow
was
singled
out
and
given
unprecedentedly
harsh
punishment.
now,
capital
punishment
in
its
functioning
today
is
a
precise
reflect
of
what
happenned
to
(inaudible)
and
the
waking
of
the
life
leads
me
to
mention
that,
because
i
will
be
arguing
both
of
the
selective
cases,
i
would
have
to
develop
part
of
my
constitutional
argument
in
the
second.
but,
will
simply
state
in
this
first
that
the
essence
of
our
argument
applying
this
theory
to
the
eight
amendment,
is
that
the
exceeding
contemporary
rarity
of
capital
punishment.
the
fact
that
the
death
penalty
although
allowed
by
law
in
overwhelming
majority
of
american
jurisdiction
is
in
fact
applied
more
infrequently
than
any
penalty
on
frauds
and
against
the
background
of
an
ideological
debate
that
makes
it
clear
that
the
attrition
and
use
of
the
death
penalty
is
a
repudiation.
that
circumstance
presents
for
us
the
primary
objective
indicator
by
which
this
court
can
say
that
not
only
is
it
no
longer
true,
as
the
court
suggested
in
cope
v.
dallas
(ph)
that
the
death
penalty
is
still
generally
accepted.
but
to
the
contrary,
the
death
penalty
is
virtually
unanimously
repudiated
and
condemned
by
the
conscience
of
contemporary
society.
now,
developing
that
point
factually
i
think
it
is
not
difficult.
the
national
crime
commission
in
its
study,
three
years
ago
pointed
out
that
the
most
salient
characteristic
of
capital
punishment
was
infrequency
of
its
use.
and
every
inform
commentator
who
has
studied,
perhaps
accepting
the
respondents
from
these
cases
come
to
the
same
conclusion
and
if
i
may
just
read
professor
herbert
wechler's
description
which
i
think
is
a
fair
one.
there
is
a
striking
contrast
between
the
broad
extent
to
which
the
penalty
of
death
is
authorized
by
law
and
the
relative
infrequency
with
which
the
sentence
is
actually
imposed
or
carried
out.
despite
the
imperfections
in
the
data,
it
is
clear
that
capital
punishment
is
executed
only
in
a
fraction
of
the
cases
where
it
can
be
legally
imposed.
a
fraction
that
is
trivially
infirmity
and
has
been
steadily
diminishing
in
recent
years
i
should
say
that
we
do
not
rely
on
the
dwindling
to
zero
of
the
death
penalty
in
the
last
few
years.
that
is
of
course
in
large
measure
the
result
of
judicial
status.
but
what
i
would
point
out
is
that
even
before
the
national
campaign
began
which
secured
those
judicial
status
in
1967.
during
the
decade
of
the
60’s
executions
is
in
the
united
state
dropped
to
an
average
of
about
20
a
year
down
from
a
high
of
almost
200
and
an
ordinary
normal
175
or
150
during
previous
decades.
i
should
also
point
out
that
the
number
of
death
sentences
returned
by
juries
during
the
decade
of
the
60’s
and
before
1968
is
about
a
100
year.
now,
what
you
are
talking
about
is
a
country
where
there
are
52
jurisdictions
competent
to
impose
capital
punishment
and
the
population
of
200
million
people.
43
jurisdiction
which
actually
use
the
death
penalty
for
some
crime
and
only
100
people
convicted
of
capital
punishment
and
only
20
actually
executed.
i
will
--
it
will
be
the
court's
pleasure
to
serve
the
continuation
of
this
theme
for
the
argument.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
and
the
three
cases
to
follow,
present
the
question
whether
the
infliction
of
the
penalty
of
death
on
each
of
the
petitioners.
there
is
a
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
within
the
eight
and
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution.
the
cases
present
a
range
of
factual
situations.
in
this
first
aikens
case,
the
death
penalty
was
inflicted
upon
a
multiple
murderer
for
an
intentional
killing
of
the
particularly
atrocious
sort.
in
the
second
case,
the
furman
case,
we
have
a
killing
in
the
course
of
the
burglary
murder
which
may
or
may
not
have
been
intentional
and
it
is
not
attended
by
the
same
aggravating
circumstances
and
in
the
third
and
fourth
cases
jackson
and
branch,
we
have
the
infliction
of
the
death
penalty
for
the
crime
of
rape.
the
briefs
of
the
parties
and
of
the
amici
canvas
a
broad
range
of
considerations
under
the
eight
and
fourteenth
amendments.
but
i
think
there
are
mergers
from
the
briefs,
the
clear
impression
that
the
central
issue
in
this
case,
the
real
nerve
of
this
controversy,
is
the
scope
and
indeed
the
propriety
of
judicial
review
of
legislatives,
state
legislative
determinations
to
use
the
penalty
of
death.
the
briefs
on
behalf
of
the
respondents
primarily
support
the
death
penalty
on
the
ground
that
it
exists
on
the
statute
books
of
41
states
and
of
the
federal
government.
and
that
it
has
been
put
there
by
the
legislatures
of
41
states
in
the
federal
government
and
that
those
legislatures
are
the
primary
keepers
of
the
national
conscience
in
penal
matters.
and
the
elected
representatives
of
the
people
whose
judgment
is
entitled
to
respect.
i
agree
with
all
of
that,
but
for
me
i
think
that
is
the
beginning
and
not
the
end
of
analysis
under
the
eight
amendment
because
judicial
review
of
legislative
judgment
is
just
as
inevitable
as
it
is
difficult.
under
a
constitution
which
commits
to
the
courts,
protection
of
the
individual
under
guarantee
such
as
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
or
due
process
or
equal
protection
of
the
laws,
precisely
because
these
guarantees
are
fundamental
statements
of
the
most
basic
principles
of
our
society.
the
least
conferring
to
the
narrow
historical
circumstances
that
gave
them
birth.
they
are
cast
in
general
terms
their
generality
makes
them
difficult
to
interpret
and
it
also
creates
the
risk
which
mr.
justice
frankfurter
frequently
warned
the
court
about
that
the
court
may
read
its
own
dispositions
in
the
constitution.
but
at
the
same
time,
these
very
general
prescriptions
or
the
bedrock
of
a
constitution
designed
to
endure
for
time
and
to
give
continuing
and
constant
expression
to
the
notion
that
there
are
limitations
on
the
power
of
government
to
deal
with
individuals.
guarantee
such
as
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
and
due
process
and
equal
protection
are
broad
statements
in
grand
form,
cash
for
an
unforeseeable
future
and
intended
to
be
construed
to
give
continuing
protection
to
limitations
upon
governmental
power.
such
protections
to
the
individual
are
not
likely
often
to
be
added
to
the
constitution
by
the
amending
process
because
when
they
most
needed
they
are
least
likely
to
commend
the
political
approval
necessary
to
add
so
they
are
put
in
general
form
and
they
are
committed
the
courts
to
construe
as
times
change
during
the
life
of
the
nation
and
visit
by
the
constitution.
i
conclude
from
that
that
although
difference
and
circumspection
the
legislative
judgment
is
vital.
that
abnegation
of
judicial,
the
legislative
judgment
is
impermissible
because
the
very
existence
of
a
clause
like
the
eight
amendment
prohibition
of
cruel
and
unusual
punishment,
belies
the
idea
that
legislatures
are
totally
free
in
their
choice
of
penalogic
methods.
the
important
thing
is
plain.
it
is
that
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
clause
is
a
restriction
on
legislation.
in
the
context
of
american
government
where
penal
sanctions
are
primarily
legislative.
it
can
only
have
meant
to
limit
legislative
means
and
this
court
has
in
fact
pretty
times
appied
it
to
invalidate
legislation
and
the
only
cases
and
fact
in
which
it
has
applied
the
clause
to
vindicate
any
plan.
the
question
is
what
are
those
limitations
on
legislative
judgment?
how
stringent
are
they?
where
does
this
court
get
the
standards
by
which
to
determine?
the
problem
of
standards
is
critical
because
of
the
generality
of
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
that
i
described.
the
language
is
not
crystalline
it
is
not
clear
you
cannot
look
at
the
punishment
and
see
whether
the
cruel
you
cannot
look
at
it
to
see
whether
it
is
unusual.
and
history
although
relevant
cannot
be
controlling
because
of
the
evolutionary
nature
of
the
guarantee
and
its
projection
into
the
future
as
i
described.
the
state
of
california,
state
of
georgia
and
texas
to
some
extent
in
their
briefs
have
all
made
the
point
that
at
the
time
of
the
eight
amendment
was
written,
capital
punishment
was
widely
used.
the
fifth
amendment
clearly
envisages
that
there
will
be
capital
cases.
the
federal
congress
put
capital
statutes
on
the
books.
all
of
these
misconceived
i
think
our
submission
to
the
court
which
is
not
that
when
the
eight
amendment
was
ratified
in
1791
it
was
intended
then
and
there
to
do
with
capital
punishment,
anymore
than
it
was
intended
then
and
there
to
do
away
with
whippings
or
brandings
or
cutting
off
the
beers
or
anymore
than
equal
protection
clause
when
originally
put
in
to
the
constitution,
it
is
intended
to
give
equal
rights
to
indigents
or
to
women.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
would
congress
have
the
power
to
prohibit
the
death
penalty
under
the
eight
amendment?
oh!
surely
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
in
the
state,
yes
your
honor
but
we
go
further
than
that
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
with
regard
to
capital
punishment
in
the
state?
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no
your
honor
there
has
been
bills
submitted
by
a
senator
hart,
congressman
seller
which
would
impose
a
moratorium
on
execution.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
it
has
not
even
come
to
committee
hearing,
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that
is
correct
mr.
stewart.
the
problem
of
construing
the
eight
amendment
emerges
i
think
from
what
i
have
said
that
if
the
language
isn't
clear
and
if
history
is
not
controlled
where
does
the
court
get
standards,
where
does
it
find
the
basis
for
judgment
in
determining
whether
legislation
is
cruel
and
unusual.
the
primary
problem
with
formulations,
that
you
frequently
find
in
lard
port
cases
such
as
announcement
of
punishment
may
shot
the
conscience
of
the
court
or
be
unnecessarily
cruel
or
some
such
thing
in
that
in
wide
subjective
judgment
and
one
thing
i
think
all
the
parties
here
may
your
honor,
it
is
not
the
purpose
of
the
constitution
to
allow
the
judges
to
write
their
own
penalogical
reflections
into
it.
the
arguments
made
by
the
state
in
these
case
to
sustain
capital
punishment,
would
i
think
equally
sustain
branding
of
confidence
meant
on
the
forehead
with
the
letter
c
or
cutting
the
hands
off
the
pickpockets
or
any
atrocious
punishments.
and
these
punishments
i
think
would
plainly
be
condemned
by
the
eight
amendment
but
it
beholds
us
to
ask
why.
is
it
simply
because
we
would
be
shocked,
we
would
be
in
testimony
uphold
to
those
punishments
more
than
the
punishment
of
death,
if
they
are.
i
do
not
think
so;
i
think
it
is
because
there
are
objective
and
judicially
cognizable
basis
for
making
a
determination
under
the
eight
amendment.
and
in
our
brief
we
have
tried
to
set
forth
what
are
those
standards,
what
those
objective
standard
for
judicial
judgement
are?
specifically
we
think
that
the
question
under
the
eight
amendment
is
whether
the
punishment
applied
to
a
particular
individual
would
by
all
available
objective
indications
be
unacceptable
to
general,
contemporary,
conscience
and
standards
of
decency.
it
if
were
generally
and
uniformly
applied
to
any
reasonable
proportion
of
persons
subject
to
penalty
for
that
crime.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that
is
true
mr.
justice
douglas,
that
is
true
in
all
for
these
cases
that
the
death
penalty
is
discretionary
with
either
judge
or
jury
depending
on
who
tries
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
each
of
the
four.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no
indeed
the
state
policy
is
simply
that
the
penalty
of
death
be
available
not
that
it
be
imposed
on
any
particular
murder
or
any
particular

in

--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
nor
indeed
in
the
record
of
any
of
the
cases
before
the
court
which
discloses
that.
judicially
noticeable
findings
i
believe
set
out
in
our
brief
reflect
with
some
in
precision.
those
factors
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
supports
and
the
state
of
california
has
thrown
into
which
brief
they
could
deal
of
material
which
is
neither
in
the
record
nor
judicial
noticeable.
there
are
some
published
materials
such
as
the
racial
statistics,
which
i
think
our
judicially
noticeable
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
mr.
justice
douglas
on
that.
the
reason
why
we
urge
that
the
standard
i
just
described
is
a
proper
standard
under
the
eight
amendment.
what
this
court
must
do?
is
to
look
and
see
whether
the
punishment
inflicted
in
a
particular
case
would
be
tolerable,
acceptable
to
prevailing
standards
to
decency
generally
applied.
is
the
essentially
treatable
i
have
three
considerations
commend
that
standard
to
the
court.
and
i
should
say
i
take
the
court's
time
at
this
point
to
talk
about
the
eight
amendment
standard
because
this
court
has
very
little
developed
theory
and
a
concept
to
the
eight
amendment.
and
the
parties
are
i
think
more
in
disagreement
about
the
theory
of
the
eight
amendment
and
they
are
about
any
other
aspect
to
the
case.
any
good
three
reasons
to
this;
first
of
all
our
conception
of
the
theory
of
the
eight
amendment
picks
appropriate
count
of
the
different
nature
and
the
different
roles
under
the
constitution
of
legislature
in
the
courts.
legislatures
are
not
primarily
concerned
with
the
application
of
penalties
in
this
particular
cases.
as
mr.
justice
douglas's
question
suggests
the
legislature
with
regard
to
capital
punishment
has
simply
said
the
death
an
available
penalty.
it
may
never
be
used;
it
may
rarely
and
infrequently
be
used.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
there
are
a
number
of
them
left,
to
my
knowledge
s
there
is
only
one
capital
crime
in
the
united
state
in
which
there
are
any
men
on
death
row.
most
of
them
are
obsolete
such
as
prison
against
the
state
and
that
sort
of
thing
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
one
crime
is
the
california
crime.
4500
in
california
penal
crime
is
resolved
by
life
time
inmate
upon
non-inmate
where
the
person
assaulted
dies.
that
is
the
only
mandatory
capital
crime
as
to
which
i
know
there
is
anyone
on
death
row
at
this
standard.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
there
are
other
statutes
essentially
absolute
which
impose.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
oh
yes.
it
has
been
a
development
that
the
death
penalty
has
been
made
discretionary.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that
is
correct
there
is
no
state
yet
left
which
has
a
mandatory
capital
punishment
for
murder
or
rape
either
of
the
crimes
involved
here
or
any
other
of
the
ordinary
crimes
capital
punishments.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that
is
about
right.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
pardon
me.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that
is
correct.
the
district
of
columbia
and
new
york
were
the
last
two
in
the
united
states,
--
less
than
mandatory
--
a
capital
sentencing
provision.
the
second—
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
none
mr.
justice
douglas
it
is
entirely—
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
the
aikens
case
was
tried
and
sentencing
done
by
a
judge.
in
a
jury
tried
case
in
california,
the
trial
judge
may
set
aside
the
jury's
verdict.
the
california
supreme
court
may
not
review
the
sentence
whether
imposed
by
a
judge
or
jury.
the
second
reason
why
i
think
our
theory
or
standard
of
the
eight
amendment
commends
itself
to
the
court,
is
that
it
assigns
a
proper
function
to
the
eight
amendment
in
the
constitution
of
the
democracy
because
in
a
democracy
it
is
not
at
all
likely
that
the
legislature
will
put
on
to
the
statute
books
a
penalty
which
is
cruel,
which
is
unacceptable
to
public
conscience
in
a
generally
applicable
uniform
fashion.
a
stature
which
is
going
to
be
generally
applied,
which
would
be
repugnant
to
public
conscience
if
generally
applied
will
not
commend
enough
public
acceptance
to
get
on
the
statute
for
in
the
first
place.
the
problem
in
democracy
is
that
legislation
maybe
inactive
in
such
a
form,
that
it
can
be
arbitrarily,
selectively
spottily
applied
to
a
few
outcast
thrive,
whose
political
positions
are
so
weak
and
with
personal
situation
is
on
popular
and
were
so
ugly
that
public
revulsion
which
would
follow
the
uniform
application
of
the
penalties
applied
to
them,
does
not
follow
in
its
few
outcast
creatures
are
condemned
to
that
punishment.
what
we
are
saying
essentially
is
that
a
punishment
cast
in
a
form
so
that
it
can
be
used
this
way,
comes
to
the
court
suspect
under
the
eight
amendment
and
when
it
is
actually
applied
so
infrequently,
so
incredibly
relict
as
the
death
penalty
is
that
the
suspicion
materializes
and
the
penalty
is
identified
as
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
this
is
no
new
constitutional
conception.
i
am
really
saying
nothing
more
than
what
mr.
justice
stone
said
in
footnote
4
of
carolene
products
which
is
that
where
legislation
is
cast
in
the
form
such
as
unlikely
to
make
it
politically
remediable,
such
as
to
sterilize
the
ordinary
political
processes
that
keep
the
legislature
acting
decently
and
keep
legislation
reflective
of
the
public
conscience.
then
a
particular
obligation
devolves
on
the
court
to
assess
the
constitutionality
of
that
legislation.
the
third
reason
why
i
think
our
theory
of
the
eight
amendment
amends
itself
to
the
court.
is
that
it
does
not
imbibe
subjective
judicial
judgment.
it
does
not
ask
this
court
to
put
itself
in
the
position
of
super
legislature
and
decide
matters
of
penalogical
policy.
in
fact
our
theory,
i
believe
offers
the
only
alternative
to
subjective
judicial
judgment
because
if
one
looks
for
a
moment
at
the
grounds
on
which
the
state
seek
to
support
capital
punishment
that
it
is
the
retribution
of
the
permissible
legislative
aim
and
that
in
some
cases
retribution
requires
killing
people
that
deterrence
is
a
permissible
legislative
aim
and
legislature
could
find
the
capital
punishment
had
something
deterrent
efficacy.
you
immediately
see
that
the
same
arguments
could
and
that
would
be
made
if
the
legislature
for
fraud
boiling
in
oil
as
a
punishment
for
crime.
legislature
might
say
that
is
a
horrible
curse.
let
it
boiling
in
oil
if
they
do
that.
that
could
only
fit
retribution
for
that
crime
and
the
legislature
might
direct
at
an
awful
thing.
we
got
to
stop
that
and
the
only
way
to
really
make
it
a
horrible
and
prevent
this
from
doing
it
if
we
correct
them
in
boiling
in
an
oil.
boiling
in
oil
if
they
do
it.
and
the
state
could
be
able
to
make
essentially
same
arguments
that
they
are
making
here
against
capital
punishment.
in
favor
of
capital
punishment,
those
arguments
would
not
be
sustained
but
why
would
they
not
be
sustained,
is
it
because
boiling
in
an
oil
was
somehow
more
shocking
to
the
digestive
system,
to
the
intestinal
reaction
of
people
or
particular
judges
i
do
not
think
so.
i
think
it
is
because
an
objective
standards
which
we
invite
this
court
to
apply
the
capital
punishment
generally,
would
be
offended
by
boiling
in
oil.
and
i
think
it
is
offended
by
any
form
of
infliction
of
the
death
penalty
debt.
mr.
anthony
g.

only
in
the
limited
sense
mr.
justice
douglas
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
applies
the
guaranty
of
the
eight
amendment
in
state.
there
is
not
within
the
scope
of
the
grant
of
certiorari
in
this
case
any
independent
due
process
question
and
the
question
is
not
raised
below.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
think
i
agree,
i
think
it
is
more
than
a
semantic
problem,
i
think
it
is
a
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
yes
i
think
that
is
right
your
honor
but
i
think
there
is
a
difference
between
an
explicit
permission
and
simply
a
negative
inference
from
the
fact
that
there
are
certain
guarantees
that
say
that
if
the
death
penalty
is
to
be
imposed.
certain
procedures
must
be
followed,
there
must
be
a
grand
jury
indictment,
there
must
be
due
process
of
law.
i
do
not
think
that
one
can
say
that
the
language
in
the
constitution
which
by
inference
permits
a
death
penalty.
meant
to
project
a
continuing
permission
of
it
i
think
all
that
one
can
say
is
that
so
long
as
the
death
penalty
could
be
imposed
at
all
or
was
imposed
at
all,
it
could
only
be
imposed
within
these
restrictions
and
that
i
think
takes
us
back
to
the
initial
question.
i
do
not
think
and
i
am
not
urging
that
when
anybody
put
any
of
this
language
into
the
constitution,
they
meant
to
provoke
our
capital
punishment
i
think
it
what
they
meant
to
do
was
to
put
in
several
guarantees
of
rights.
one
guaranty
against
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
which
would
grow
and
involve
as
society
grew
and
involve.
another
is
the
guaranty
of
the
right
to
life,
liberty
and
property,
not
to
have
it
taken
away
without
due
process
of
law,
the
right
to
prosecution
by
indictment
and
that
sort
of
thing,
what
they
said
there
was
in
describing
what
a
legislature
could
not
do.
they
said
if
it
is
seeks
to
take
away
light,
the
only
inference
that
there
is
this—then
it
was
conceived
at
that
time
that
the
state
might
take
away
life.
it
can
only
do
it
by
these
procedure.
there
in
no
projection
forward
of
the
notion
that
the
taking
of
life
is
permissible.
they
is
simply
a
statement
that
we
know
now
that
the
taking
of
life
is
permissible
so
long
as
it
is
permissible,
these
guarantees
must
obtain.
i
think
there
is
no
inconsistency
in
that.
if
one
simply
recognize
the
historical
fact
that
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
clause
does
grow
and
evolve.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
a
last
point
that
i
think
is
that
some
significance
before
i
turn
to
the
capital
punishment
itself
is
that
our
theory
of
the
eight
amendment
is
also
without
historical
support.
the
eight
amendment
seems
to
advent
the
result
of
a
confluence
of
three
primary
concerns.
a
concern
against
the
excessive
punishments
which
you
see
in
english
laws
far
back
and
that
is
a
part
of
a
concern
against
the
selective
imposition
of
harsh
punishments,
and
a
concern
without
right
for
a
better.
the
most
immediately
relevant
one
i
think
is
the
second.
the
concern
against
the
selective
use
of
harsh
criminal
punishment
which
immediately
led
to
the
english
bill
of
rights
provision
in
1689,
that
is
now
the
language
of
the
eight
amendment.
the
english
bill
of
rights
provision
was
put
there
largely
as
a
result
of
the
(inaudible).
and
if
you
look
back
at
the
trial
of
vote,
what
you
see
is
that
the
actual
punishment
imposed
on
earth,
it
was
not
barbaric.
it
was
--
that
he
was
to
be
divested
as
a
clergy
man,
that
he
was
to
be
imprisoned
for
life
and
then
he
was
to
be
pilloried
and
whipped
annually
on
the
occasion
that
the
perjuries
because
of
his
conviction.
and
the
complaint
lodged
against
that
judgment
which
led
to
the
bill
of
rights
was
not
that
it
was
harsh
at
the
time
when
they
were
still
killing
thousands
of
people.
it
wasn't
intrinsically
barbaric,
it
was
it
was
selective.
one
fellow
was
singled
out
and
given
unprecedentedly
harsh
punishment.
now,
capital
punishment
in
its
functioning
today
is
a
precise
reflect
of
what
happenned
to
(inaudible)
and
the
waking
of
the
life
leads
me
to
mention
that,
because
i
will
be
arguing
both
of
the
selective
cases,
i
would
have
to
develop
part
of
my
constitutional
argument
in
the
second.
but,
will
simply
state
in
this
first
that
the
essence
of
our
argument
applying
this
theory
to
the
eight
amendment,
is
that
the
exceeding
contemporary
rarity
of
capital
punishment.
the
fact
that
the
death
penalty
although
allowed
by
law
in
overwhelming
majority
of
american
jurisdiction
is
in
fact
applied
more
infrequently
than
any
penalty
on
frauds
and
against
the
background
of
an
ideological
debate
that
makes
it
clear
that
the
attrition
and
use
of
the
death
penalty
is
a
repudiation.
that
circumstance
presents
for
us
the
primary
objective
indicator
by
which
this
court
can
say
that
not
only
is
it
no
longer
true,
as
the
court
suggested
in
cope
v.
dallas
(ph)
that
the
death
penalty
is
still
generally
accepted.
but
to
the
contrary,
the
death
penalty
is
virtually
unanimously
repudiated
and
condemned
by
the
conscience
of
contemporary
society.
now,
developing
that
point
factually
i
think
it
is
not
difficult.
the
national
crime
commission
in
its
study,
three
years
ago
pointed
out
that
the
most
salient
characteristic
of
capital
punishment
was
infrequency
of
its
use.
and
every
inform
commentator
who
has
studied,
perhaps
accepting
the
respondents
from
these
cases
come
to
the
same
conclusion
and
if
i
may
just
read
professor
herbert
wechler's
description
which
i
think
is
a
fair
one.
there
is
a
striking
contrast
between
the
broad
extent
to
which
the
penalty
of
death
is
authorized
by
law
and
the
relative
infrequency
with
which
the
sentence
is
actually
imposed
or
carried
out.
despite
the
imperfections
in
the
data,
it
is
clear
that
capital
punishment
is
executed
only
in
a
fraction
of
the
cases
where
it
can
be
legally
imposed.
a
fraction
that
is
trivially
infirmity
and
has
been
steadily
diminishing
in
recent
years
i
should
say
that
we
do
not
rely
on
the
dwindling
to
zero
of
the
death
penalty
in
the
last
few
years.
that
is
of
course
in
large
measure
the
result
of
judicial
status.
but
what
i
would
point
out
is
that
even
before
the
national
campaign
began
which
secured
those
judicial
status
in
1967.
during
the
decade
of
the
60’s
executions
is
in
the
united
state
dropped
to
an
average
of
about
20
a
year
down
from
a
high
of
almost
200
and
an
ordinary
normal
175
or
150
during
previous
decades.
i
should
also
point
out
that
the
number
of
death
sentences
returned
by
juries
during
the
decade
of
the
60’s
and
before
1968
is
about
a
100
year.
now,
what
you
are
talking
about
is
a
country
where
there
are
52
jurisdictions
competent
to
impose
capital
punishment
and
the
population
of
200
million
people.
43
jurisdiction
which
actually
use
the
death
penalty
for
some
crime
and
only
100
people
convicted
of
capital
punishment
and
only
20
actually
executed.
i
will
--
it
will
be
the
court's
pleasure
to
serve
the
continuation
of
this
theme
for
the
argument.
