what
say
no
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
say
that
--
would
you
say
that
the
witness
can
apply
with
the
person
indicted,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
are
the
statutes
commerce
indicted
or
the
person
who
indicted
would
be
able
to
challenge
the
light
and
on
the
grounds
of
illegally
obtained
evidence
put
up
with
the
grand
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
something
is
wrong?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
you
wrong
on
these
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
tough
line,
i
thought.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
might
be
indicted
yourself.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
now,
you’ve
finally
have
made
a
--
taken
a
position
one
way
or
another?
justice
byron
r.
white
section
3504
rather
requires
you
to
do
it
before
you’ve
been
making
--
force
some
decision
making
on
a
task
on
a
court
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
don’t
you
think
it
makes
quite
a
bit
of
difference
whether
you
admit
that
there
was
a
tap
or
deny
that
there
was
a
tap
or
you
deny
it
was
a
legal
or
admit
it
was
a
legal
in
terms
of
what
our
problems
are?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
now
say
no
in
a
exception
to
place
it
off?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
kind
of
case
have
we
got
here,
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
must
say,
let's
assume
in
a
district
court
the
government
would
come
in
and
certified,
however,
you
normally
do
it,
there
had
been
no
overhearing
of
these
witnesses.
that
would
have
been
the
end
of
the
matter,
wouldn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
why
should
we
have
to
deal
with
difficult
constitutional
or
statutory
question
just
because
the
government
is
unwilling
to
say
whether
there
was
an
overhearing
or
not
or
whether
was
it
illegal
in
their
view?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
just
an
assume
sort
of
a
case.
let's
assume
it
is
illegal,
so
that
we
can
get
some
decisions
on
something?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
didn’t
the
government
say
yes
or
no
in
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
found
(inaudible)
you
usually
do
unless
(inaudible)
other
cases,
you
looked
around
and
you
often
certified
in
this
court
or
in
some
other
courts,
there
was
not
a
listening?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
wasn’t
any
wire
tapping.
it’s
just
an
advisory
opinion
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
where
are
you
reading
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
that
the
government
really
should
have
the
privilege
of
either
complying
with
disclosure
or
having
litigated
whether
the
person
making
the
motion
is
an
aggrieved
person,
that
you
should
have
the
--
you
are
saying
you
are
entitled
to
have
your
question
answered?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
even
though
that
involves
difficult
constitutional
and
statutory
questions
perhaps?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
unless
you
lose.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
disclosure
in
the
grand
jury,
if
someone
just
asked
a
person
about
some
events
and
it
doesn’t
involve
putting
anything
out
of
an
overheard
conversation
or
even
referring
to
it,
but
nevertheless,
it
had
its
roots
in
that
conversation,
is
that
disclosure?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
was
involved
here
did
you
say?
disclosure
of
the
conversations
or
use
or
both?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
are
we
arguing
about
then?
what
are
we
arguing
about
now
according
to
conversation
that
was
heard?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
understand
the
government’s
position
to
be
that
no
one
may
challenge
on
the
basis
of
being
in
conflict
with
this
act,
the
introduction
of
any
evidence
before
a
grand
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don’t
have
to
add
any
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
government
clearly
claims
that
no
witness
before
a
grand
jury
may
challenge
the
illegality
of
the
evidence
the
government
is
using.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
how
about
anybody
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
think
may
the
defendant
challenge
the
indictment
itself?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
seems
that
3504,
at
least
contemplates
the
possibility
that
somebody
maybe
challenging
the
introduction
of
some
evidence
before
a
grand
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
talks
about
a
grand
jury.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don’t
know
whether
a
witness,
but
somebody,
they're
certainly
seem
to
contemplate
that
some
exclusionary
arguments
might
go
on
before
a
grand
jury
in
some
context
in
connection
with
somebody.
justice
byron
r.
white
who
are
they?
who
are
those
people?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
it’s
a
witness?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
else
might
it
be?
is
there
anyone
else
before
a
grand
jury
but
a
witness?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that’s
your
argument
though,
isn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
sister
egan
would
be
sentenced
to
contempt
without
this
(voice
overlap)
being
decided
that
she
has
presented
here.
i
suppose
you
ought
to
know
or
have
the
opportunity
to
answer
or
not
on
the
assumption
that
there
wasn’t
any
wire
tapping.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know,
but
if
a
witness
for
a
grand
jury
refuses
to
answer
on
the
assumption
because
the
government
won't
say
anything
else
on
the
assumption
that
there's
been
illegal
tapping,
that’s
one
thing.
but
if
she
refuses
to
answer
knowing
that
there
hasn’t
been
any
taps,
that’s
another
thing.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
is
now.
the
solicitor
general
says
there’s
been
no
wire
tap.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
mr.
justice
brennan
has
suggested
to
you
that
perhaps
this
court
in
past
cases
have
accepted
here
the
solicitor
general’s
representation
that
there
hadn’t
been
any
wire
tap.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
court
of
appeals
decided
the
question
on
the
merit?
justice
byron
r.
white
without
knowing
whether
there
was
electronic
surveillance
or
not?
justice
byron
r.

right.
