justice
thurgood
marshall
do
i
understand
your
position
to
be
that
any
person
that
gets
in
that
situation
can
never
be
called
before
any
grand
jury
on
any
time
on
any
circumstance?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
the
tap
was
illegal?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
1971,
could
they
call
them
in
1978
before
grand
jury?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
just
trying
to
find
out
how
much
price
did
you
want
to
pay?
justice
thurgood
marshall
these
now
raises
another
point
which
is
that
as
i
understand
that
under
no
circumstances
where
he
have
any
business
for
the
grand
jury.
under
no
circumstances
what
he
volunteer
any
testimony
and
under
no
circumstances
where
he
give
any
information
unless
force
to
do
so,
and
two,
that
is
no
way
the
government
would
have
known
about
it
that
he
was
a
witness
except
by
the
step.
and
therefore
because
the
government
got
this
piece
of
information
which
is
that
he
did
know
something,
that
that
in
it
if
the
government
had
not
had
that
information
they
never
recalled.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
is
trying
to
find
some
way
to
get
around
being
a
volunteer
witness
before
the
grand
jury.
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
i
understand
your
position
is
that
before
the
1968
act
there
was
no
way
you
could
question
any
way
that
the
government
got
the
evidence,
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
regardless
of
how
unlawful
the
action
of
the
prosecuted
authority
was.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
tigar
what
would
happen
if
“a”
beats
up
“b”
and
may
“b”
tell
the
story
to
the
grand
jury
about
“c”?
what
remedy
does
“b”
have?
justice
thurgood
marshall
“a”
is
a
priest.[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
supposed
it
was
a
state
officer
who
beat
him
up?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now
what?
well,
how?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
would
he
do
before
he
testifies?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
should
be
decided
a
month
that
be
testified.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
mr.
friedman,
suppose
the
question
i
asked
of
mr.
tigar.
i
suppose
the
man
filed
an
affidavit
that
says
that
the
us
attorney
beat
me
over
the
head
until
i
confessed,
would
the
government
feel
obliged
to
deny
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
not
deny
this,
if
it’s
true?
justice
thurgood
marshall
a
motion
to
suppress.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
just
don’t
see
why
the
government
can’t
deny
it?
does
the
government
deny
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
do
deny
it
now.
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
did
you
find
that
out?
justice
thurgood
marshall
compared
with
one
of
the
other
cases
we
had
this
morning,
as
of
right
now,
what
is
the
“case
and
controversy”
that's
before
us?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
the
opinion
of
a
court
not
the
judgment?
it’s
opinion,
isn’t
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
i
just
can’t
see
how
both
of
you
together
convince
us
to
take
the
case
where
the
substance
is
now
gone?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(voice
overlap)
to
us
doing
it.
what’s
wrong
with
sending
it
back
and
let
you
stand
up
in
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
district
court
and
say
no,
there
was
no
tap?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
opinion
is
still
there.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
you’ve
told
the
court
of
appeals
what
you
are
telling
us,
they
wouldn't
have
decided
that
way
maybe?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
whole
point
is
the
facts
haven’t
changed
from
the
time
they
came
to
the
file
until
now.
the
facts
haven’t
changed
is
that
the
government
gets
a
little
time
to
catch
up
with
the
facts.[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
at
some
place
else
(inaudible)
law
that
where
allegations
are
made
and
not
denied,
they
consider
to
be
true.
am
i
right
(inaudible)?
justice
thurgood
marshall
who
were
the
parties?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
except
the
government.
you
don’t
become
a
party
until
the
government
indicts
you.
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
the
party
or
not,
the
grand
jury,
they're
talking
about
aggrieved
body.
they're
not
talking
about
parties
in
the
official
sense
in
the
grand
jury.
justice
thurgood

that’s
what
i
was
