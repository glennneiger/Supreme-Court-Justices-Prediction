it’s
what
is
ended?
justice
potter
stewart
now
what
if
there
is
subsequently
a
criminal
trial
at
which
they,
neither
one
of
these
petitioners
is
a,
neither
one
of
these
parties
is
a
defendant.
somebody
else
is
a
defendant
but
they
are
called
as
witnesses
in
the
criminal
trial,
witnesses
for
the
government
or
as
on
cross-examination
by
the
government,
can
they
do
it
then?
justice
potter
stewart
so
you
are
not
limiting
it
to
a
grand
jury?
justice
potter
stewart
of
that
very
witness?
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
they
can’t
even
assert
that
at
a
trial,
at
a
criminal
trial.
so
you
are
limiting
your
argument
to
the
grand
jury?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
is
a
question
begging.
what
is
a
permissible
privilege?
justice
potter
stewart
my
hypothesis
it
was
his
fourth
amendment
right
that
was
violated,
the
witnesses
and
by
asserting
the
right
not
to
answer,
he
is
trying
to,
he
is
to
through
him,
a
sanction
is
being
imposed
against
violation
of
his
fourth
amendment
rights.
justice
potter
stewart
and
will
be
continually
i
suppose
if
there
is
no
sanction
against
its
violation.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that’s
true
in
the
basic
weeks
situation
or
mapp
situation.
the
violations
taken
before
the
crime.
justice
potter
stewart
not
in
the
green
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
in
egan?
justice
potter
stewart
before
you
leave
3504,
you
probably
--
is
this
the
whole
section
on
pages
33
and
34
of
egan
case?
justice
potter
stewart
it
doesn’t
say
what
happens
after
the
opponent
of
the
claim
shall
affirm
or
deny
the
occurrence
of
the
alleged
unlawful
act.
it
doesn’t
(voice
overlap)
say
what
happens
if
it
was
denied
or
(voice
overlap).
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
doesn’t
say
so.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
read
it
that
if
the
government
denies,
then
that’s
the
end
of
it.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that’s
not
i
know
the
issue
here.
justice
potter
stewart
these
arguments
you
didn’t
make
in
the
last
case
just
because
you
didn’t
have
--
it’s
equally
applicable
to
both
cases,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
the
arguments
you're
now
making.
justice
potter
stewart
this
argument
is
equally
applicable
to
both
cases,
except
a
little
more
so
to
the
previous
ones.
justice
potter
stewart
and
not
necessary
on
the
other
hand
for
you
to
win
either
case.
it’s
an
alternative
argument,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
in
both
cases?
justice
potter
stewart
well
your
point
is
i
suppose
in
the
previous
case
we’re
going
to
have
to
decide
these
issues
and
if
we
accept
the
government’s
argument
in
the
previous
case,
then
it
doesn’t
make
any
difference
of
whether
or
not
there's
was
or
there
was
a
wire
tap.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
then
the
government
is
right
and
then
your
client
is
going
to
be
held
in
contempt
even
on
the
assumption
contrary
to
the
fact
that
it
now
presently
appears
that
there
was
illegal
wire
tapping.
justice
potter
stewart
the
issue
is
going
to
be
decided
in
the
previous
case,
that
your
point,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice

it’s

what
