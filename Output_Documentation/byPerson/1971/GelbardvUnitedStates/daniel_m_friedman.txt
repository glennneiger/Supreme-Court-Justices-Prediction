mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
think
the
starting
point
in
this
case,
should
be
the
law
as
it
existed
prior
to
the
1968
statute.
our
position
in
this
case
is
that
prior
to
that
law,
it
was
well
settled
that
a
witness
before
a
grand
jury
could
not
challenge
before
being
required
to
give
testimony
before
that
grand
jury,
either
the
evidence
which
led
the
grand
jury
to
summon
him
or
the
evidence
which
was
proposed
to
be
used
before
the
grand
jury
in
examining
him.
and
our
position
furthermore
is
that
congress
cannot
be
deemed
to
have
changed
this
well-settled
principle
without
some
clear
expression,
indicating
that
it
intended
to
do
so
in
the
1968
act
and
then
we
looked
at
the
1968
act,
we
think,
not
only
does
that
act
not
show
any
congressional
decision
to
change
it
but
on
the
contrary,
it
affirmatively
shows
an
intention
to
continue
that
rule
and
not
to
permit
witnesses
before
a
grand
jury,
to
challenge
the
evidence
before
the
grand
jury.
prior
to
turning
to
this
discussion
however,
i’d
like
to
respond
to
one
question.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
decline
to
answer
questions
mr.
justice,
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
before
the
grand
jury
that
claimed
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
refusing
to
answer
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
but
they
refused
to
answer
questions
mr.
justice,
for
two
reasons.
first
they
said,
the
only
reason
the
grand
jury
was
led
to
call
them
was
because
of
this
electronic
surveillance
and
the
information
it
have
obtained
and
secondly
they
said
as
objective
as
the
government
recognized,
that
the
evidence
obtained
through
this
electronic
surveillance
would
be
used
to
refresh
their
recollection,
and
that
is
what
they
objected
to.
they
said
we
have
a
right
not
to
testify
before
the
grand
jury
until
we
can
first
determine
whether
or
not,
the
evidence
which
the
grand
jury
proposed
to
use
in
either
examining
the
witnesses
which
led
the
grand
jury
to
call
the
witnesses
was
the
product
of
illegal
electronic
surveillance.
they
want
to
litigate
out
before
testifying
the
question
whether
or
not
there
was
improper
electronic
surveillance
relating
to
them
and
our
basic
submission
to
this
court
is
that
they
do
not
have
the
right
to
do
that,
that
that
is
an
issue
they
can
raise
only
if
and
when
the
evidence
is
sought
to
be
used
against
them,
against
them
in
a
criminal
proceeding.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
are
any
--my
answer
to
this
one
mr.
justice,
any
information
that
the
government
obtained
as
the
result
of
a
search
and
seizure
that
was
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
can
be
excluded
by
them
if
they
are
ever
preceded
against
criminally,
they
can
exclude
that,
but
we
say,
they
cannot
refuse
to
answer
questions
put
to
them,
before
the
grand
jury
on
the
claim,
on
the
claim
that
this
kind
of
evidence
was
the
reason
for
their
question.
they
can
claim
personal
privilege
if
they
claim
that
the
answers
to
these
questions
would
tend
to
incriminate
them.
they
may
make
that
claim.
if
they
claim
that
the
answer
to
the
question
would
violate
any
of
the
traditional
privileges,
such
as
lawyer-client
privilege,
they
can
refuse
to
answer
on
that
ground
but
we
say
they
cannot
refuse
to
answer
on
the
ground
that
there
was
a
prior,
illegal
electronic
surveillance
which
either
led
the
grand
jury
to
call
them
on
the
basis
of
which
they
would
be
questioned.
they
cannot
refuse
to
give
evidence
in
other
words,
before
the
grand
jury
on
the
basis,
on
the
basis
of
the
factors
that
led
the
grand
jury
to
call
them.
that’s
not
we
think
an
appropriate
issue
to
litigate
in
the
context
of
the
grand
jury
proceeding.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice,
they
cannot,
they
can
again
refuse
to
answer
any
question
that
might
tend
to
incriminate.
they
cannot
refuse
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
but
that
is
the
only
question
in
this
case.
our
basic
position
is
that
a
witness
cannot
refuse
to
answer
a
question
either
before
a
grand
jury
before
a
court,
on
the
ground
that
this
witness,
that
this
question
is
somehow
the
result
of
some
illegal
electronic
surveillance.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
of
that
very
witness,
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
our
argument
goes
beyond
that
we
think
that
is
what
the
law
has
always
been,
a
mere
witness
cannot
refuse
to
answer
an
otherwise
proper
question
on
the
claim
that
previously
there
had
been
some
violation
of
his
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment.
he
can
refuse
to
answer
any
question
in
terms
of
a
permissible
privilege,
a
privilege
that
the
law
allows,
but
he
cannot
refuse
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
think
a
permissible
privilege
is
a
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
what
i
would
call
the
personal
privileges
where,
in
contrast
to
the
giving
of
the
testimony
which
relates
back
to
an
illegal,
allegedly
illegal
search
and
seizure,
where
the
mere
giving
of
the
testimony
itself
reaches
the
privilege,
that
is
in
the
case
for
example
the
lawyer-client
communication,
the
privilege
is
breached.
at
the
time
the
witness
is
forced
to
disclose
the
confidential
communication.
now
in
the
search
and
seizure
situation
if
there
has
been
illegal
electronic
surveillance,
that
has
happened
a
long
time
before,
the
question
is
whether
that
can
now
be
made
public
and
basically,
basically
in
case
for
example
of
a
criminal
trial,
if
a
witness
declines
to
answer
a
question,
claiming
the
question
results
from
an
illegal
search
and
seizure,
what
he
is
really
seeking
to
do
is
not
to
prevent
the
introduction
of
that
evidence
against
him
but
to
prevent
the
introduction
of
that
evidence
against
a
third
party
and
we
think
at
least
well
it
doesn’t
specifically
hold
that,
at
least
the
rationale
of
the
alderman
decision
indicates
that
that
can’t
be
done.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
but
the
fourth
amendment
right
has
already
been
violated
mr.
justice
and
we
don’t
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
there
are
sanctions,
for
example
only
last
term,
this
court
in
the
bivens
case
is
indicated
that
there
was
a
right
of
action
for
damages
and
under
this
1968
statute
as
an
expressed
right
of
action
for
damages
given,
there
are
also
criminal
penalties
for
violation
of
the
law,
but
we
don’t
think
that
a
witness
in
effect
can
refuse
to
give
partnered
evidence
because
he
says,
well,
this
would
compound
and
continue
the
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
his
rights,
the
right
is
to
be
protected
against,
to
be
secure
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures.
the
search
and
seizures
has
taken
place
by
definition
long
before,
that
is
we
think
when
the
right
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
yes
but
--
if
i
may
mr.
justice,
i
think
that
illustrates
the
reason
why
we
believe
the
courts
have
not
permitted.
people
like
witnesses
before
a
grand
jury
to
raise
these
issues
in
the
weeks
and
then
the
mapp
situation
and
all
the
cases
involving
the
exclusionary
rule
the
question
was
whether
the
evidence
taken
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
rights
was
to
be
used
against
the
defendant.
and
the
theory
it
seems
are
these
cases
is
that
the
right
giving
you
by
the
fourth
amendment
to
be
secure
in
your
person
and
property
against
unreasonable
searchers
and
seizures
would
be
an
empty
thing.
if
despite
that
the
evidence
obtain
through
this
search
and
seizures
could
be
used
against
you.
could
be
used
against
you
but
in
the
case
where
a
witness
is
merely
being
asked
questions,
where
he
is
not
a
defendant
in
a
case
the
evidence
is
not
being
used
against
them.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
–-
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
he
is
not
a
volunteer
witness
he
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
so
far
as
he
was
a
witness
before
the
grand
jury
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
with
one
exception
mr.
justice,
with
one
exception
and
that
is
the
situation
involved
in
the
silverthorne
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
as
to
which
reference
has
been
made.
i’d
like
to
discuss
briefly
the
silverthorne
case
because
we
think
that
is
a
different
case.
what
happened
in
the
silverthorne
case
was
that
the
silverthorne’s
had
been
indicted
and
after
they
have
been
indicted
and
arrested
the
government
officials
without
any
authority
at
all
just
came
into
their
house
and
made
a
complete
swift
of
all
their
personal
property
they
took
all
the
books
and
records
and
brought
it
in
there.
and
these
people
in
turn
went
to
the
district
court
and
got
a
court
order
directing
the
return
of
this
property.
the
court
holding
that
the
property
had
been
illegally
seized
from
the
government.
after
that
a
new
grand
jury
was
convened
which
was
investigating
other
violations
of
the
law
by
the
same
individuals
and
what
the
new
grand
jury
did
was
to
issue
a
subpoena
for
the
identical
books
and
records
that
have
previously
have
been
taking
and
have
been
ordered
returned
and
this
court
in
a
landmark
opinion
refused
to
do
so.
it
refused
to
do
so
i
think
not
passing
any
general
principal
that
whenever
a
witness
is
called
before
a
grand
jury
he
has
the
right
to
contest
the
way
in
which
the
grand
jury
called
him
but
rather
on
the
particular
circumstances
as
case.
silverthorne
is
a
three-page
opinion
of
justice
holmes
as
written
in
his
usual
tight
style
and
what
he
said
i
think
reveals
very
clearly
what
was
the
matter
with
this
case,
i
think
he
explained
the
government
contention
as
follows.
he
said
the
government’s
contention
is
that
although
of
course
its
seizure
was
in
outrage
which
the
government
now
regrets,
it
may
copy
the
papers,
use
the
knowledge
as
obtained
and
compel
production
again.
i
think
the
silverthorne
case
is
the
unusual
situation
where
you
just
had
quite
outrageous
conduct
where
you
had
a
search
that
had
previously
been
judicially
determined
to
be
illegal
and
then
the
government
just
around
and
said,
well
we
don’t
have
to
pay
any
attention
to
that
we
can
undercut
that
determination
of
illegality
by
just
calling
the
records
back
before
another
grand
jury
under
a
new
subpoena.
and
this
court
very
properly
refused
to
countenance
that.
this
case
it
seems
to
us
is
the
antithesis
of
that.
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
surveillance
was
made
pursuant
to
a
court
order.
there’s
no
allegation
here.
there’s
no
determination
here
that
there
was
anything
illegal
about
the
surveillance.
they
now
claim
the
surveillance
as
illegal.
they
now
object
to
the
surveillance
but
it
seems
to
us,
this
is
a
very
different
situation
from
what
you
had
in
silverthorne.
silverthorne
is
of
course
relied
on
by
both
the
petitioners
in
this
case
and
the
respondents
in
the
next
case
as
announcing
this
broad
rule.
we
think
silverthorne
turns
on
its
particular
facts.
that
silverthorne
does
not
announce
this
broad
rule.
the
rule,
the
rule
has
been
an
ordinarily
that
a
grand
jury
may
consider
any
evidence
it
has
however
it
came
into
the
grand
jury’s
possession.
this
court
repeatedly
as
recognized
that
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
cannot
challenge
the
indictment
on
the
ground
that
improper
evidence
was
produced
before
the
grand
jury.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
it
is
hard
it
--
we
can
approach
it
either
way
their
contention
is
that
they
--
you
could
approach
it
i
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct
i
just
gave
this
as
a
background
because
of
the
argument
to
which
i
now
like
to
turn
to
show
that
congress
in
the
1968
act
not
only
did
not
intend
to
give
the
witnesses
before
the
grand
jury
this
right
but
that
in
fact
it
intended
to
continue
as
a
legislative
history
shows
and
has
indeed
as
the
footnote
in
your
honor’s
opinion
in
the
alderman
case
indicated
that
it
intended
to
continue
the
existing
rules
of
standing
with
respect
to
this
suppression
of
evidence
before
grand
juries.
and
i
would
now
like
to
turn
to
the
language
of
the
statute
itself.
it’s
been
a
good
bit
of
discussion
here
in
general
terms
about
the
statute.
i’d
like
to
deal
specifically
with
it.
the
first
provision
is
in
section
25.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
so.
i
will
come
to
--
i
have
an
argument
as
to
why--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that’s
the
assumption
of
this
argument.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
by
a
grand
jury
witness.
that
is
correct
and
i
will
say
that
i
don’t
want
to
interrupt
my
argument
now
but
in
the
next
case,
i
would
make
an
argument
that
in
fact,
in
fact
these
allegations
are
not
enough
to
establish
a
violation
of
the
statute.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
we
assume
for
purposes
of
this
discussion
that
there
has
been
a
violation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
assume
that
for
purposes
of
the
discussion.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
precisely
so.
that’s
precisely
our
submission
mr.
justice.
now
let
me
start
with
section
2515
which
is
set
forth
the
page
8
of
the
petitioner’s
brief
this
green
document
and
its
caption
prohibition
of
used
of
evidence
as
evidence
of
intercepted
wire
or
oral
communications
and
it
says
whenever
there
is
been
any
interception
of
an
oral
or
wire
communication
no
part
of
the
contents
of
such
communication,
and
no
evidence
derived
there
from
may
be
received
in
evidence
in
any.
and
then
there’s
a
larger
group
of
proceedings
any
trial,
any
hearing
before
any
grand
jury,
before
any
legislative
committee
or
any
authority
of
the
united
states
etcetera,
etcetera
if
a
disclosure
of
that
information
would
be
in
violation
of
the
statute.
now
this
statute
provides
the
standard.
it
contains
the
basic
prohibition
upon
the
received
in
evidence
of
material
in
violation
of
the
statute.
however,
it
does
not
explain
the
procedures
by
which
this
right
is
to
be
implemented
and
the
procedures
for
implementing
this
right
as
contained
in
section
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
would
seem
to
with
one
qualification
which
i
just
like
to
make
for
qualification
but
not
argue
at
length
at
this
point
what
it
prohibits
is
the
precedent
evidence
of
such
material
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
or
any
fruit
if
the
disclosure
of
that
information
would
be
in
violation
of
this
chapter.
not
if
the
interception
was
in
violation
of
this
chapter
but
if
the
disclosure
would
be
in
violation
of
this
chapter
and
i
have
this
argument
which
i
make
it
to
read
that
takes
a
little
time
as
to
why
the
disclosure
was
not
but
its
starts
with
the
prohibition.
however
2518
subparagraph
10
which
is
contained
at
page
20
of
the
petitioner’s
brief
provides
the
procedures
for
motions
to
suppress
and
the
senate
committee
report
on
this
statute
and
this
is
the
only
pertinent
legislative
history
on
this
title
because
the
house
committee
report
did
not
deal
with
the
bill
in
its
present
form
so
that
the
prohibitions
of
2515,
the
prohibition
upon
the
receipt
of
the
evidence
must
of
course
be
read
in
light
of
section
2518
(10)
discussed
below
which
defines
the
class
entitled
to
make
a
motion
to
suppress.
that
is
it
does
not
--2515
itself
does
not
contain
any
operative
provision
as
to
how
the
right
provide
that
there’s
to
be
enforce.
that
is
provided
by
section
2510,
2518
(10).
and
the
senate
committee
also
said
that
section
2518
(10)
later
on
when
it
came
to
discuss
that
must
be
read
in
connection
with
section
2515
which
it
limits
in
other
words
the
right
provided
in
section
2515
is
limited
by
the
standing
provided
in
section
2515
is
limited
by
the
standing
provided
in
section
2518
(10)
and
it
also
said
that
this
latter
section
subsection
10
provides
the
remedy
for
the
right
created
in
section
2515.
so
that
it
seems
to
us
there’s
a
clear
interrelationship
between
them.
now
what
is
the
provision
of
the
remedy
provided
in
2518
(10).
well
there
are
two
striking
things
about
it.
the
list
of
proceedings
before
which
a
motion
to
suppress
may
be
made
is
the
same
as
that
in
2515
with
two
striking
exceptions.
there’s
no
provision
made
in
that
for
a
grand
jury
proceeding.
and
there
is
no
provision
for
that
in
a
--
before
a
legislative
committee.
and
the
legislative
history
we
think
shows
quite
clearly
that
this
omission
was
not
inadvertent.
that
in
fact,
congress
intentionally
decided
not
to
permit
the
making
of
these
motions
to
suppress
in
connection
with
either
a
grand
jury
proceeding
or
a
legislative
proceeding.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
say
that
it
so
mr.
justice
because
it
seems
to
us
that
it
sometimes
very
difficult
to
drive
the
line
between
someone
who
is
a
witness
and
someone
who
is
being
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
sometimes
it
is
easy
but
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct
he
could
of
course
object
to
the
introduction
of
any
evidence
at
the
trial
against
him
based
on
an
illegal
interception.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that’s
correct
mr.
justice.
the
committee,
the
senate
committee
in
describing
this
subsections
stated
as
follows:
because
no
person
is
a
party
as
such
to
a
grand
jury
proceeding.
the
provision
does
not
envision
the
making
of
a
motion
to
suppress
in
the
context
of
such
a
proceeding
itself.
normally,
there’s
no
limitation
on
the
character
of
evidence
that
may
be
presented
to
a
grand
jury
which
is
enforceable
by
an
individual
citing
blue
against
united
states.
there
is
no
intention
to
change
this
general
rule.
it
is
the
intention
of
the
provision
only
that
when
a
motion
to
suppressed
is
granted
in
another
context
and
that
we
think
is
an
articulation
of
a
basic
principal
i
have
discussed
and
announced
in
silverthorne.
when
a
motion
to
suppress
is
granted
in
another
context
its
scope
may
include
use
in
a
future
grand
jury
proceeding.
nor
is
there
any
intention
to
grant
jurisdiction
to
federal
courts
over
the
congress
itself
and
of
course
if
the
petition
is
a
correct
that
this
provision
permits
a
witness
before
a
grand
jury
to
challenge
the
evidence,
it
seem
the
same
total
i
think
that
a
witness
before
a
congressional
committee
could
object
to
answering
questions
before
the
committee
because
he
said
the
committee
called
me
as
a
result
of
the
evidence
obtained
through
an
illegal
wiretap.
now
the
contempt
proceeding,
the
contempt
proceeding
is
we
think
so
costly
connected
with
the
grand
jury
proceeding
that
it
can
fairly
be
said
to
raise
the
issue
in
the
language
of
the
committee
in
the
context
of
a
grand
jury
proceeding.
the
only
way
a
witness
can
be
compelled
to
testify
before
a
grand
jury
is
to
hold
them
in
civil
contempt
to
get
the
court
to
tell
the
witness
as
the
witness
was
told
in
this
case
that
they
must
stand
committed
for
the
life
of
the
grand
jury
until
they
answer
the
questions.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh!
i
have
look
i
said
mr.
justice
we
do,
i
believe
but
they
cited
in
the
brief
in
the
egan
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
egan
case
was
the
case
in
which
referred
prior
the
first
brief
and
we
do
cite
the
grand
jury
to
cases
and
discuss
them
at
pages
14
to
15
of
our
egan
brief.
we
cite
a
number
of
court
of
appeals
cases
which
have
declined
permit
this
type
of
motion
to
be
made
before
a
grand
jury.
our
brief
in
this
case
because
of
the
fact
that
in
this
case
with
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
i
am
afraid
not,
we
don’t.
now
i
would
also
like
to
turn
to
another
provision
of
the
statute
which
reflects
the
same
intention
on
the
part
of
congress
and
that
is
subsection
9
in
the
middle
of
page
20
which
has
been
referred
to
excess
the
contents
of
any
interception
--
intercepted
wire
communication
shall
not
be
received
in
evidence
or
otherwise
disclose
in
any
trial
hearing
or
other
proceeding
unless
each
party
is
given
10
days
notice
there
if
not,
two
things
about
the
language.
it
spokes
--
speaks
of
trial
hearing
or
other
proceeding
and
it
speaks
of
a
party.
ordinarily,
a
witness
is
not
viewed
as
a
party
before
the
grand
jury.
the
word
party
as
we
used
it
in
our
law
means
parties
to
a
trial.
and
once
again
the
legislative
history
the
senate
report
confirms
to
that
view
because
in
speaking
of
paragraph
9,
what
the
senate
committee
says
is
proceeding
is
intended
to
include
all
adversary
tight
hearings.
it
would
include
a
trial
itself
a
probation
revocation
proceeding
or
a
hearing
on
a
motion
for
reduction
of
sentence.
it
would
include
a
grand
jury
hearing
citing
again
blue
against
united
states.
so
once
again
it
seems
to
us
that
the
legislative
history
of
these
provisions
is
as
clear
as
can
be,
that
congress
did
not
intend
by
these
words
to
give
any
rights
to
a
witness
before
a
grand
jury.
this
suggestion
has
been
made
both
in
this
case
and
in
the
following
case
that
this
statute
is
so
clear
on
its
face.
that
no
resort
need
be
had
to
the
legislative
history,
it
is
clear
on
its
face
they
say
because
they
look
to
the
definition
of
aggrieve
party
and
they
say
that
the
people
who’ve
been
overheard
come
within
the
definition
of
aggrieve
party
therefore
that
is
the
end
of
the
matter.
well,
this
is
a
very
complicated
statute.
it
occupies,
a
text
to
this
title
alone
occupies
23
or
24
of
the
printed
pages
in
the
brief.
it’s
a
statute
that
is
certainly
not
clear
on
its
face.it’s
difficult
to
know
what
these
things
mean
and
i
think
it
is
essential
in
this
case
to
have
resort
to
the
legislative
history
to
ascertain
precisely
what
congress
was
seeking
to
do.
precisely
what
rights
congress
was
giving
to
this
people
whether
congress
was
intending
for
the
first
time
to
give
witnesses
before
the
grand
jury
the
right
to
challenge
the
introduction
of
evidence
before
it.
now
as
i
have
indicated
a
congress
did
not
leave
witnesses
in
this
situation
without
a
remedy.
congress
provided
an
unusual
thing,
it
provide
a
specific
suit
for
damages
in
section
2520
of
the
statute.
and
this
provision
would
permit
a
witness
if
he
has
in
fact
been
injured
by
an
illegal
surveillance
to
recover
damages.
indeed,
it’s
a
rather
unusual
provision
because
it
permits
punitive
damages,
not
only
actual
damages
and
attorney’s
fees
but
punitive
damages.
now
with
this
as
far
as
the
1968
act
is
concerned,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
another
provision
which
is
a
provision
of
the
second
statute,
the
1970
statute.
the
claim
has
been
made
that
even
if
the
1968
statute
perhaps
did
not
give
these
witnesses
any
rights,
nevertheless,
the
1970
statute
did.
and
that
is
a
provision
section
3504
and
that
provision
was
the
reaction
to
this
congressional
reaction
to
this
court’s
decision
in
the
alderman
case.
congress
was
concerned
that
as
the
result
of
the
alderman
decision
there
would
be
an
enormous
increase
in
the
number
of
hearings
required
in
court
to
litigate
all
of
his
claims
of
illegal
electronic
surveillance
and
congress
attempted
to
reduce
the
number
of
those
hearings
and
what
congress
did
in
this
section
and
it
can
be
found
at
page,
the
end
of
our
brief
in
the
egan
in
this
case
--
sorry
none
of
our
brief
in
the
egan
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
it’s
not
in
the
green
brief
mr.
justice.
it
is
in
the
government’s
brief
in
the
next
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
egan
at
pages
33
to
34
and
this
provision
contains
three
subsections
and
i
would
like
in
order
to
explain
it
first
to
discuss
the
last
two
and
then
come
to
the
first
one
because
the
only
one
they
can
rely
on
is
the
first
one.
the
last
two
provisions
said
as
follows:
that
would
respect
to
any
electronic
surveillance
taking
place
before
june
19,
1968
and
that
was
the
effective
date
of
title
3
of
the
1968
act.
they
shall
not
be
required
any
hearing
with
respect
to
the
validity
of
that
surveillance
unless
the
information
brought
to
bear
may
be
relevant
to
the
claim
of
inadmissibility
of
the
evidence.
that
was,
i
read
congressional
concern
that
people
would
make
all
sorts
of
allegations
that
they
may
have
been
some
kind
of
a
taint
and
that
as
a
result
of
that
taint,
the
evidence
would
be
rendered
and
admissible.
then
they
went
on
beyond
that
and
said
that
in
any
of
that
if
there
was
electronic
surveillance
before
the
june
1968
date
and
the
surveillance
occurred
more
than
five
years
prior
to
the
conduct
to
this
--
at
issue
on
the
case.
there
was
to
be
no
consideration
otherwise
any
possible
taint
of
an
electronics
surveillance
that
occurred
more
than
five
years
before
the
time
at
which
the
evidence
of
violation
--
evidence
of
violations
involved
that
was
to
attenuate
it.
so
it
started
that
was
the
basic
purpose
of
the
statute.
then,
what
its
said
was
in
any
trial,
hearing
or
other
proceeding
you
know
before
any
court,
grand
jury
etcetera,
etcetera.
this
language
does
include
the
word
grand
jury.
it
does
not
include
the
word
legislative
committee
and
it
says
upon
a
claim
by
a
party
aggrieved
that
evidence
is
inadmissible
because
it
is
the
primary
product
of
an
unlawful
act
and
unlawful
act
is
defined
in
the
statute
to
mean
electronic
surveillance
the
government
shall
affirm
or
deny
that
allegation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
third
circuit
presents
basically
the
same
issue
as
was
before
the
court
in
the
last
case.
it
arises,
however,
in
different
factual
kind,
a
different
factual
context
in
two
respects.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
we
do
mr.
justice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
we
don’t
cite
davis
versus
mississippi.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
have
--
we’ve
dealt
with
it
mr.
justice
as
early
as
we
thought
was
necessary
to
set
forth
the
law
in
this
area.
perhaps,
we
should
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
think
mr.
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
be
happy
to
mr.
justice.
we
think
the
law
of
this
court
as
of
today
is
that
witnesses
do
not
have
the
(inaudible).
we
think
that
we’ve
cited
cases
for
example,
costello
and
blue
which
recognized
the
broad
role
of
the
grand
jury
and
the
fact
that
evidence
improperly
obtained
before
the
grand
jury
is
not
(inaudible)
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
the
blair
case,
which
unfortunately
we
have
mis-described
as
the
civil
liberties
union
points
out,
it
did
not
involve
the
fourth
amendment,
but
it
did
announce
the
principle
that
a
witness
before
grand
jury
could
not
even
challenge
the
constitutionality
(voice

mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
be
(voice
overlap)
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
be
happy
to
submit
such
memorandum
mr.
justice.
now,
the
two
distinctions
factually
between
this
case
and
the
preceding
case
is
this.
in
the
preceding
case,
there
was
conceivably
court-authorized
surveillance
and
the
government
acknowledged
that
the
petitioners
there
had
been
overheard
on
that
surveillance.
in
this
case,
the
government
has
never
admitted
any
surveillance
and
indeed,
in
it’s
brief
in
this
court,
it
denies
that
surveillance
took
place.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
have
taken
the
position
there
is
no
(voice
overlap).
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
only
mr.
justice,
3504
requires
it
only
if
3504
applies
in
the
case
of
a
witness
before
a
grand
jury.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
it
does
except
mr.
justice
(voice
overlap)
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
say
that
there
was
no
--
if
i
may
say,
there
was
no
overhearing
of
either
of
these
witnesses.
we
do
not
take
any
position
on
whether
somebody
is
telling
(voice
overlap).
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
--
the
court
of
appeals
decided
this
case
on
the
assumption
that
in
fact,
there
was
overhearing
because
the
government
had
not
denied.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
hopefully,
but
in
some
situations,
the
district
courts
in
some
of
these
cases
have
said
for
example
that
the
affidavit
that
was
submitted
denying
the
overhearing
wasn’t
sufficient
and
there’d
been
situations
in
which
despite
that,
they’ve
been
(voice
overlap)
the
proceeding.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
all
i
can
say
mr.
justice
is
that
we
did
not
take
any
position
on
this
before
the
lower
courts
because
it
was
our
view
that
the
witnesses
were
not
entitled.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
but
it’s
not
quite
that.
let
me
say
that
the
(voice
overlap).
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
because
all
i
can
answer
mr.
justice
is
that
the
government
in
this
cases
has
taken
--
consistently
taken
the
position
in
this
type
of
situation
that
a
witness
has
no
right
to
challenge
this
question
and
the
respondents
(voice

mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
the
respondents
had
concurred.
they
now
object
to
this
statement
on
our
part
and
say
they
might
be
hearing
on
(voice
overlap)
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it’s
also
mr.
justice.
it’s
not
quite
as
that
simple
matter
for
the
government
in
these
situations
every
time
a
witness
makes
this
claim
to
be
able
to
answer
then
and
there
there
has
or
hasn’t
been
overhearing.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
assume
so.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
so.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i’m
sorry.
in
what
context
was
this?
i’m
sorry.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
a
motion
to
suppress,
i
would
think
the
government
would
deny
it,
but
it
seems
if
that
would
be
i
assume
an
independent
motion
to
suppress.
let
me
put
the
case
if
i
may
(voice

mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
deny?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
we
do
deny
it.
yes,
we
do.
we
said
there
has
been
no
overhearing
of
either
of
these
two
ladies.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don’t
know
when
we
found
it
out
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
assume
that
when
this
demand
was
made,
this
triggered
an
investigation
and
at
some
point
in
the
proceedings,
we
concluded
that
there
was
no
basis
to
think
(voice
overlap).
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
one
problem
in
the
face
of
this
case,
in
this
case
as
distinguished
from
other
cases,
the
claim
is
now
made
that
they
deny
this.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
the
issue
of
course
is
before
the
court
in
the
preceding
case.
and
in
this
case,
whether
we
have
this
decision
off
the
court
of
appeals,
that
was
based
on
the
assumption
that
there
had
been
illegal
wire
tapping.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
if
you
vacated
the
judgment,
i
think
it
still
have
the
precedent
standing.
it
will
be
weakened
a
good
bit.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it’s
perhaps
an
advisory
opinion
though
i
suspect
we’ll
have
considerable
impact
before
the
third
circuit
and
while
the
district
court
is
in
the
third
circuit.
now,
(voice

mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
case
of
controversy
is
what
(voice
overlap).
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
the
case
of
controversy
mr.
justice
is
whether
or
not
these
witnesses
were
properly
held
in
contempt
for
refusing
to
answer
the
questions.
that’s
the
case
of
controversy
and
that
depends
on
whether
they
were
required
to
answer
the
questions
in
the
face
of
their
claim
of
illegal
electronic
surveillance.
that
seem
to
me
is
the
case
of
controversy
and
there
still
is
a
controversy.
they
still,
i’m
sure
when
the
counsel
gets
up
will
vigorously
deny
that
they
had
any
obligation
and
they
will
say,
i
am
sure
that
despite
the
government’s
denial,
they’re
entitled
with
hearing
before
they
had
to
testify.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
agree.(voice
overlap)
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
cannot
find
any
objection
to
doing
that
except
all
i
can
say
mr.
justice
to
that
is
that
(voice
overlap).
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
opinion
is
still
there
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
decided
it
on
that
basis.
the
court
of
appeals
then
has
to
rule
in
this
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
court
of
appeals
announced
the
rule
in
this
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
court
of
appeals
said,
it
amended
its
opinion
subsequently
to
read
as
follows,
it
says,
“since”
(voice
overlap).
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
is
from
an
addendum
to
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
which
is
contained
in
sister
egan’s
brief
in
opposition
in
this
case
at
page
16.
it’s
this
white
document.
and
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
was,
“since
sister
egan
has
not
yet
been
afforded
a
hearing
regarding
her
allegations
of
illegal
electronic
surveillance
by
the
government,
for
the
purpose
of
this
appeal,
we
assume
her
allegations
to
be
true.”
so
the
court
of
appeals
seems
to
have
announced
a
rule
that
where
the
government
has
not
denied
these
allegations,
the
case
will
be
decided
on
the
basis
that
those
allegations
are
true
and
it
proceeded
to
decide
the
case
on
that
basis.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that’s
the
normal
rules
of
pleading.
now,
the
other
aspect
of
this
case
is
that
unlike
mr.
gelbard
or
mr.
parnas,
both
of
these
two
ladies
before
being
called
before
the
grand
jury
was
given
full
transactional
immunity,
not
the
narrowly
used
immunity,
but
the
full
transactional
immunity,
which
means
that
neither
of
these
witnesses
could
be
subject
to
any
criminal
prosecution
or
penalty
for
any
testimony
they
gave.
the
facts
with
respect
to
both
of
these
ladies
are
very
similar.
in
january
1971,
sister
egan
who
is
a
catholic
nun
and
the
other
respondent,
ms.
walsh
is
not,
was
subpoenaed
to
appear
before
a
grand
jury
sitting
in
harrisburg,
pennsylvania
investigating
various
alleged
violations
of
the
criminal
code.
this
is
the
same
grand
jury
that
returned
the
indictment
in
the
barragan
case,
the
first
indictment
in
that
case
was
returned
two
days
before
and
sister
egan
was
named
as
an
un-indicted
co-conspirator.
sister
egan
appeared
before
the
grand
jury
and
refused
to
answer
any
questions
claiming
that
this
would
violate
her
rights
under
the
fifth
amendment.
and
following
this,
she
was
first
given
more
limited
so
called
used
immunity
and
then
the
day
after
when
it
became
apparent
to
the
government
that
she
would
continue
to
assert
her
privilege
under
the
firth
amendment,
she
was
given
the
full
transactional
immunity.
she
was
then
called
before
the
grand
jury
and
refused
to
answer
any
questions
other
than
giving
her
name
and
her
address.
she
was
asked
and
refused
to
answer
approximately
70
or
80
other
questions
and
following
her
refusal,
the
district
court
held
her
in
civil
contempt
and
ordered
her
committed
until
she
purged
the
content.
she
gave
six
different
grounds
for
refusing
to
answer
the
questions
and
the
pertinent
one
set
forth
at
page
54
of
the
record
here,
which
this
is
the
provision
relating
to
the
alleged
illegal
wiretaps,
it’s
number
four
in
the
top
of
page
54.
she
said,
“the
evidence
on
the
basis
of
which
i
have
been
named
as
a
non-indicted
co-conspirator,
subpoenaed
to
testify
and
answer
questions
was
secured
by
illegal
wiretaps.
in
addition,
all
or
some
of
the
telephone
communications
monitored
by
the
united
states
government,
involved
communications
within
the
roman
catholic
church
of
america
and
specifically,
between
my
provincial
headquarters
and
the
offices
of
the
church
in
new
york,
rome
and
throughout
the
united
states.”
the
second
witness,
ms.
walsh
was
called
before
the
grand
jury
in
april
of
1971
three
months
later.
she
was
intentionally
given
full
transactional
immunity.
she
refused
to
answer
all
the
questions
put
to
her
before
the
grand
jury
and
the
same
thing
happened.
both
of
these
ladies
were
therefore
held
in
civil
contempt.
a
divided
third
circuit
reversed
by
a
vote
of
five
to
three.
all
members
of
the
court,
all
five
judges
agreed
that
the
1968
act
gave
a
witness
before
a
grand
jury
the
right
to
challenge
the
evidence,
which
led
the
grand
jury
to
call
the
witness.
in
addition,
two
of
the
judges
also
believed
that
the
fourth
amendment
gave
the
witnesses
this
right.
the
government’s
arguments
in
this
case
are
substantially
the
same
as
those,
which
was
made
in
the
last
case
both
on
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
under
the
statue.
and
i
would
therefore
like
to
turn
briefly
to
the
argument
that
i
was
making
when
the
court
--
of
the
argument
on
the
previous
case
was
terminated
and
that
is
the
applicability
of
section
3504
to
this
claim.
3504
is
set
forth
in
our
brief
in
the
egan
case
at
page
33
and
i
had
previously
indicated
that
what
it
did
was
to
limit
the
total
amount
of
hearings
that
would
be
required
in
cases
of
electronic
surveillance
occurring
prior
to
1968.
we
have
that
cut
off
date.
and
then
it
goes
on
and
say,
if
there’s
any
hearing
before
a
grand
jury
upon
a
claim
by
a
party
of
aggrieved,
that
evidence
is
inadmissible
because
it
is
the
primary
product
of
an
unlawful
act
defined
as
electronic
surveillance
or
the
exploitation
of
such
act.
the
opponent
of
the
claim
shall
affirm
or
deny
the
occurrence
of
the
alleged
unlawful
act.
now,
although
this
refers
to
the
making
of
such
a
claim
at
a
proceeding
before
a
grand
jury,
the
claim
to
be
entertained
must
be
made
by
a
party
aggrieved
and
in
discussing
this
section,
the
legislative
history
speaks
of
someone
who
makes
a
claim,
speaks
of
a
claim
by
a
defendant,
it
uses
the
word
by
a
defendant
withstanding
to
challenge
the
unfair
practices.
a
defendant
is
ordinarily
not
viewed
as
someone
who
is
a
witness
before
a
grand
jury.
and
furthermore,
standing
comes
again
to
the
question
i
have
previously
discussed
as
to
whether
or
not,
whether
or
not
a
mere
witness
before
a
grand
jury
has
standing.
and
it
seems
to
us
would
be
most
anomalous
we
think
that
the
congress,
which
in
this
statute
in
1970
was
attempting
to
reduce
the
volume
of
litigation
growing
out
of
claims
of
illegal
electronic
surveillance,
would
at
the
same
time
have
given
to
grand
jury
witnesses
a
right
to
challenge
evidence
before
a
grand
jury
that
they
didn’t
have
under
the
1968
act.
we
think
that
the
whole
basic
purpose
of
this
statute
was
to
reduce
the
amount
of
litigation
relating
to
surveillances
taking
place
before
june
1968.
and
indeed,
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
senator
mcclellan
stated
that
this
section
was
limited
to
surveillance
that
occurred
prior
to
june
1968.
and
of
course,
we
deny
surveillance,
but
if
there
was
any
surveillance
in
the
case,
it
would
appear
that
it
would
took
place
before
that
date.
now,
i
would
like
to
now
turn
to
another
argument
in
this
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
assume,
i
think
with
fair
reading
of
this
is
if
the
government
denies
it,
presumably
that’s
the
end
of
it
unless
(voice
overlap).
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
doesn’t
say
so.
but
it
does
go
on
then
to
say
that
in
the
event
--
presumably
if
the
government
admits
it,
it
then
goes
on
it
seems
to
me
--
and
that
i
think
is
a
preliminary
determination.
the
first
thing
to
find
out
is
whether
the
government
acknowledges
or
it
denies.
but
if
the
government
acknowledges
it,
(voice
overlap).
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
so,
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
then
if
the
government
acknowledges
it,
if
they
meet
the
standards
of
the
two
next
subsections,
then
you
have
a
hearing
on
it.
now,
the
argument
is
made
by
the
respondents
in
this
case
and
by
position
adopted
by
some
of
the
judges
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
it
would
violate
section
2510,
if
the
government
used
this
evidence
before
the
grand
jury,
that
is
they
say
2510
prohibits
the
use
of
any
evidence
before
the
grand
jury
if
the
evidence
is
obtained
in
violation
of
the
statute.
and
therefore,
the
argument
is
that
the
district
court
should
not
lend
its
authority
in
effect
to
permit
or
force
the
prosecutor
to
violate
the
statute
and
commit
a
crime.
i
think
this
argument
fails
to
take
adequate
account
of
the
precise
language
of
the
statute.
the
statute
says,
not
that
the
recede
in
evidence
of
any
intercepted
communication
that
is
prohibited
if
it
violates
the
statute.
what
it
says
is
it’s
prohibited
if
the
disclosure
of
that
information
would
be
in
violation
of
this
chapter.
that
is
the
prohibition
is
the
use
before
a
grand
jury
or
a
court
of
any
evidence
if
the
disclosure
of
that
would
violate
this
chapter.
that’s
in
section
2515
at
page
60
of
the
egan
brief.
now,
i’ve
shifted
to
the
egan,
of
the
respondent's
egan’s
brief.
so
therefore,
we
must
look
to
other
sections
of
the
statute
to
ascertain
what
disclosure
is
prohibited
and
the
prohibitions
on
disclosure
are
contained
in
2511,
which
begins
at
page
53
of
the
egan’s
brief
and
the
critical
sections
or
subsections
c
and
d
on
page
54
and
they
prohibit
willful
disclosure
or
willful
use
of
any
intercepted
communication
knowing
or
having
reason
to
know
that
the
information
was
obtained
through
the
interception
in
violation
of
this
subsection.
that
is
disclosure
is
only
illegal
it
seems
to
us
if
in
fact
the
person
using
it
knew
or
had
reason
to
know.
now,
in
this
case,
assuming
arguendo
was
an
interception
here,
there's
another
provision
of
this
statute.
subsection
3
at
pages
55
to
56
which
was
before
this
court
several
months
ago
in
the
keith
(ph)
case
which
is
us
against
united
states
district
court
at
subsection
3,
at
pages
55
to
56
which
says
nothing
in
this
chapter
shall
limit
the
constitutional
power
of
the
precedence,
about
halfway
down
to
first
full
paragraph
on
page
6,
to
take
such
measures
as
he
deems
necessary
to
protect
the
united
states
against
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
or
violence
or
other
unlawful
means
or
against
any
clear
and
present
danger
to
the
structure
or
existence
of
the
government.
and
it
goes
on
and
says
the
contents
of
any
communication
intercepted
by
authority
of
the
president
and
the
exercise
of
the
foregoing
powers
maybe
received
in
evidence
in
any
trials
here
and
the
other
proceeding
only
when
such
interception
was
reasonable.
our
position
is
that
as
long
as
it
has
not
been
definitively
determined
that
the
interception
without
a
warrant
in
national
security
cases
is
illegal
and
the
court
of
course
will
decide
that
in
the
keith
(ph)
case
at
least
as
long
as
that
is
the
situation,
the
prosecutor
could
not
be
charged
with
knowing
or
having
reason
to
know
that
any
evidence
obtained
as
a
result
of
an
allegedly
illegal
interception
of
anyone’s
telephone
conversation
in
this
field,
that
the
disclosure
of
that
would
be
in
violation
because
the
prosecutor
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
had
every
reason
to
believe
that
at
least
at
that
point,
it
was
permissible
to
conduct
any
such
electronic
surveillance.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
fact,
it’s
more
applicable
in
the
last
case
and
it’s
clear
in
the
last
case,
it
seems
to
me
that
a
prosecutor
who
knows
that
the
interception
has
resulted
from
an
order
of
the
district
court
cannot
be
charged
with
knowing
or
having
reason
to
know
that
it
is
in
fact
illegal
because
of
some
allegations
that
there
were
some
irregularities
in
the
thing.
i
mean
(voice
overlap).
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that’s
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
correct
mr.
justice.
and
then
in
conclusion,
i
just
like
to
say
one
other
thing
which
is
in
this
whole
area,
that
it's
very
easy
for
witnesses
before
a
grand
jury
to
make
allegations
that
they
have
been
subjected
to
illegal
wire
tapping.
that
is
coming
all
the
time.
the
allegation
is
that
they’ve
been
subjected
to
illegal
wire
tapping.
in
this
case,
at
page
87
and
88
of
the
record
is
a
motion
made
by
ms.
walsh
for
disclosure
of
electronic
surveillance
and
there's
a
long
list
of
things
she
wanted
to
have
disclosed.
items
one
to
z,
various
things
and
it’s
not
easy
for
the
government
to
answer
these
questions.
if
for
example,
a’s
telephone
were
tapped,
over
the
period
of
a
week,
they
might
hear
hundreds
of
telephone
(voice
overlap).
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
precisely.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
think
that’s
what
the
statute
provides
and
we
think
the
witness
before
the
grand
jury
is
fully
protected.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
because
once
this
issue
was
decided
mr.
justice
by
this
court
whether
or
not
a
witness
is
an
aggrieved
person,
it
seems
to
me,
that
will
end
that
aspect
of
the
litigation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i’d
just
like
to
say
that
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
think
it's
important
to
look
at
the
page
46
of
the
government’s
petition.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
is
in
this
case,
in
the
egan
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
46
of
the
government’s
petition
which
contains
the
opinions
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
the
very
last
sentence
of
the
opinion
says,
“the
judgment
of
contempt
will
be
vacated
and
the
case
remanded
for
a
hearing
to
determine
whether
the
questions
propounded
to
sister
egan
resulted
from
illegal
electronic
surveillance
directed
at
her.”
so
that
(voice
overlap)
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
the
contempt
has
been
vacated
because
the
court
of
appeals
has
reversed
the
district
court’s
decision
in
determination
of
contempt
and
has
said
that
sister
egan
was
entitled
to
litigate
this
issue
in
this
context.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that’s
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
and
of
course
our
position
is
as
i’ve
indicated
is
that
we
do
not
think
in
this
situation
she
is
entitled
basically
under
the
statute
to
litigate
this
issue
at
all.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
think
the
starting
point
in
this
case,
should
be
the
law
as
it
existed
prior
to
the
1968
statute.
our
position
in
this
case
is
that
prior
to
that
law,
it
was
well
settled
that
a
witness
before
a
grand
jury
could
not
challenge
before
being
required
to
give
testimony
before
that
grand
jury,
either
the
evidence
which
led
the
grand
jury
to
summon
him
or
the
evidence
which
was
proposed
to
be
used
before
the
grand
jury
in
examining
him.
and
our
position
furthermore
is
that
congress
cannot
be
deemed
to
have
changed
this
well-settled
principle
without
some
clear
expression,
indicating
that
it
intended
to
do
so
in
the
1968
act
and
then
we
looked
at
the
1968
act,
we
think,
not
only
does
that
act
not
show
any
congressional
decision
to
change
it
but
on
the
contrary,
it
affirmatively
shows
an
intention
to
continue
that
rule
and
not
to
permit
witnesses
before
a
grand
jury,
to
challenge
the
evidence
before
the
grand
jury.
prior
to
turning
to
this
discussion
however,
i’d
like
to
respond
to
one
question.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
decline
to
answer
questions
mr.
justice,
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
before
the
grand
jury
that
claimed
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
refusing
to
answer
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
but
they
refused
to
answer
questions
mr.
justice,
for
two
reasons.
first
they
said,
the
only
reason
the
grand
jury
was
led
to
call
them
was
because
of
this
electronic
surveillance
and
the
information
it
have
obtained
and
secondly
they
said
as
objective
as
the
government
recognized,
that
the
evidence
obtained
through
this
electronic
surveillance
would
be
used
to
refresh
their
recollection,
and
that
is
what
they
objected
to.
they
said
we
have
a
right
not
to
testify
before
the
grand
jury
until
we
can
first
determine
whether
or
not,
the
evidence
which
the
grand
jury
proposed
to
use
in
either
examining
the
witnesses
which
led
the
grand
jury
to
call
the
witnesses
was
the
product
of
illegal
electronic
surveillance.
they
want
to
litigate
out
before
testifying
the
question
whether
or
not
there
was
improper
electronic
surveillance
relating
to
them
and
our
basic
submission
to
this
court
is
that
they
do
not
have
the
right
to
do
that,
that
that
is
an
issue
they
can
raise
only
if
and
when
the
evidence
is
sought
to
be
used
against
them,
against
them
in
a
criminal
proceeding.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
are
any
--my
answer
to
this
one
mr.
justice,
any
information
that
the
government
obtained
as
the
result
of
a
search
and
seizure
that
was
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
can
be
excluded
by
them
if
they
are
ever
preceded
against
criminally,
they
can
exclude
that,
but
we
say,
they
cannot
refuse
to
answer
questions
put
to
them,
before
the
grand
jury
on
the
claim,
on
the
claim
that
this
kind
of
evidence
was
the
reason
for
their
question.
they
can
claim
personal
privilege
if
they
claim
that
the
answers
to
these
questions
would
tend
to
incriminate
them.
they
may
make
that
claim.
if
they
claim
that
the
answer
to
the
question
would
violate
any
of
the
traditional
privileges,
such
as
lawyer-client
privilege,
they
can
refuse
to
answer
on
that
ground
but
we
say
they
cannot
refuse
to
answer
on
the
ground
that
there
was
a
prior,
illegal
electronic
surveillance
which
either
led
the
grand
jury
to
call
them
on
the
basis
of
which
they
would
be
questioned.
they
cannot
refuse
to
give
evidence
in
other
words,
before
the
grand
jury
on
the
basis,
on
the
basis
of
the
factors
that
led
the
grand
jury
to
call
them.
that’s
not
we
think
an
appropriate
issue
to
litigate
in
the
context
of
the
grand
jury
proceeding.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice,
they
cannot,
they
can
again
refuse
to
answer
any
question
that
might
tend
to
incriminate.
they
cannot
refuse
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
but
that
is
the
only
question
in
this
case.
our
basic
position
is
that
a
witness
cannot
refuse
to
answer
a
question
either
before
a
grand
jury
before
a
court,
on
the
ground
that
this
witness,
that
this
question
is
somehow
the
result
of
some
illegal
electronic
surveillance.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
of
that
very
witness,
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
our
argument
goes
beyond
that
we
think
that
is
what
the
law
has
always
been,
a
mere
witness
cannot
refuse
to
answer
an
otherwise
proper
question
on
the
claim
that
previously
there
had
been
some
violation
of
his
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment.
he
can
refuse
to
answer
any
question
in
terms
of
a
permissible
privilege,
a
privilege
that
the
law
allows,
but
he
cannot
refuse
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
think
a
permissible
privilege
is
a
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
what
i
would
call
the
personal
privileges
where,
in
contrast
to
the
giving
of
the
testimony
which
relates
back
to
an
illegal,
allegedly
illegal
search
and
seizure,
where
the
mere
giving
of
the
testimony
itself
reaches
the
privilege,
that
is
in
the
case
for
example
the
lawyer-client
communication,
the
privilege
is
breached.
at
the
time
the
witness
is
forced
to
disclose
the
confidential
communication.
now
in
the
search
and
seizure
situation
if
there
has
been
illegal
electronic
surveillance,
that
has
happened
a
long
time
before,
the
question
is
whether
that
can
now
be
made
public
and
basically,
basically
in
case
for
example
of
a
criminal
trial,
if
a
witness
declines
to
answer
a
question,
claiming
the
question
results
from
an
illegal
search
and
seizure,
what
he
is
really
seeking
to
do
is
not
to
prevent
the
introduction
of
that
evidence
against
him
but
to
prevent
the
introduction
of
that
evidence
against
a
third
party
and
we
think
at
least
well
it
doesn’t
specifically
hold
that,
at
least
the
rationale
of
the
alderman
decision
indicates
that
that
can’t
be
done.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
but
the
fourth
amendment
right
has
already
been
violated
mr.
justice
and
we
don’t
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
there
are
sanctions,
for
example
only
last
term,
this
court
in
the
bivens
case
is
indicated
that
there
was
a
right
of
action
for
damages
and
under
this
1968
statute
as
an
expressed
right
of
action
for
damages
given,
there
are
also
criminal
penalties
for
violation
of
the
law,
but
we
don’t
think
that
a
witness
in
effect
can
refuse
to
give
partnered
evidence
because
he
says,
well,
this
would
compound
and
continue
the
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
his
rights,
the
right
is
to
be
protected
against,
to
be
secure
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures.
the
search
and
seizures
has
taken
place
by
definition
long
before,
that
is
we
think
when
the
right
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
yes
but
--
if
i
may
mr.
justice,
i
think
that
illustrates
the
reason
why
we
believe
the
courts
have
not
permitted.
people
like
witnesses
before
a
grand
jury
to
raise
these
issues
in
the
weeks
and
then
the
mapp
situation
and
all
the
cases
involving
the
exclusionary
rule
the
question
was
whether
the
evidence
taken
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
rights
was
to
be
used
against
the
defendant.
and
the
theory
it
seems
are
these
cases
is
that
the
right
giving
you
by
the
fourth
amendment
to
be
secure
in
your
person
and
property
against
unreasonable
searchers
and
seizures
would
be
an
empty
thing.
if
despite
that
the
evidence
obtain
through
this
search
and
seizures
could
be
used
against
you.
could
be
used
against
you
but
in
the
case
where
a
witness
is
merely
being
asked
questions,
where
he
is
not
a
defendant
in
a
case
the
evidence
is
not
being
used
against
them.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
–-
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
he
is
not
a
volunteer
witness
he
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
so
far
as
he
was
a
witness
before
the
grand
jury
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
with
one
exception
mr.
justice,
with
one
exception
and
that
is
the
situation
involved
in
the
silverthorne
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
as
to
which
reference
has
been
made.
i’d
like
to
discuss
briefly
the
silverthorne
case
because
we
think
that
is
a
different
case.
what
happened
in
the
silverthorne
case
was
that
the
silverthorne’s
had
been
indicted
and
after
they
have
been
indicted
and
arrested
the
government
officials
without
any
authority
at
all
just
came
into
their
house
and
made
a
complete
swift
of
all
their
personal
property
they
took
all
the
books
and
records
and
brought
it
in
there.
and
these
people
in
turn
went
to
the
district
court
and
got
a
court
order
directing
the
return
of
this
property.
the
court
holding
that
the
property
had
been
illegally
seized
from
the
government.
after
that
a
new
grand
jury
was
convened
which
was
investigating
other
violations
of
the
law
by
the
same
individuals
and
what
the
new
grand
jury
did
was
to
issue
a
subpoena
for
the
identical
books
and
records
that
have
previously
have
been
taking
and
have
been
ordered
returned
and
this
court
in
a
landmark
opinion
refused
to
do
so.
it
refused
to
do
so
i
think
not
passing
any
general
principal
that
whenever
a
witness
is
called
before
a
grand
jury
he
has
the
right
to
contest
the
way
in
which
the
grand
jury
called
him
but
rather
on
the
particular
circumstances
as
case.
silverthorne
is
a
three-page
opinion
of
justice
holmes
as
written
in
his
usual
tight
style
and
what
he
said
i
think
reveals
very
clearly
what
was
the
matter
with
this
case,
i
think
he
explained
the
government
contention
as
follows.
he
said
the
government’s
contention
is
that
although
of
course
its
seizure
was
in
outrage
which
the
government
now
regrets,
it
may
copy
the
papers,
use
the
knowledge
as
obtained
and
compel
production
again.
i
think
the
silverthorne
case
is
the
unusual
situation
where
you
just
had
quite
outrageous
conduct
where
you
had
a
search
that
had
previously
been
judicially
determined
to
be
illegal
and
then
the
government
just
around
and
said,
well
we
don’t
have
to
pay
any
attention
to
that
we
can
undercut
that
determination
of
illegality
by
just
calling
the
records
back
before
another
grand
jury
under
a
new
subpoena.
and
this
court
very
properly
refused
to
countenance
that.
this
case
it
seems
to
us
is
the
antithesis
of
that.
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
surveillance
was
made
pursuant
to
a
court
order.
there’s
no
allegation
here.
there’s
no
determination
here
that
there
was
anything
illegal
about
the
surveillance.
they
now
claim
the
surveillance
as
illegal.
they
now
object
to
the
surveillance
but
it
seems
to
us,
this
is
a
very
different
situation
from
what
you
had
in
silverthorne.
silverthorne
is
of
course
relied
on
by
both
the
petitioners
in
this
case
and
the
respondents
in
the
next
case
as
announcing
this
broad
rule.
we
think
silverthorne
turns
on
its
particular
facts.
that
silverthorne
does
not
announce
this
broad
rule.
the
rule,
the
rule
has
been
an
ordinarily
that
a
grand
jury
may
consider
any
evidence
it
has
however
it
came
into
the
grand
jury’s
possession.
this
court
repeatedly
as
recognized
that
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
cannot
challenge
the
indictment
on
the
ground
that
improper
evidence
was
produced
before
the
grand
jury.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
it
is
hard
it
--
we
can
approach
it
either
way
their
contention
is
that
they
--
you
could
approach
it
i
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct
i
just
gave
this
as
a
background
because
of
the
argument
to
which
i
now
like
to
turn
to
show
that
congress
in
the
1968
act
not
only
did
not
intend
to
give
the
witnesses
before
the
grand
jury
this
right
but
that
in
fact
it
intended
to
continue
as
a
legislative
history
shows
and
has
indeed
as
the
footnote
in
your
honor’s
opinion
in
the
alderman
case
indicated
that
it
intended
to
continue
the
existing
rules
of
standing
with
respect
to
this
suppression
of
evidence
before
grand
juries.
and
i
would
now
like
to
turn
to
the
language
of
the
statute
itself.
it’s
been
a
good
bit
of
discussion
here
in
general
terms
about
the
statute.
i’d
like
to
deal
specifically
with
it.
the
first
provision
is
in
section
25.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
so.
i
will
come
to
--
i
have
an
argument
as
to
why--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that’s
the
assumption
of
this
argument.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
by
a
grand
jury
witness.
that
is
correct
and
i
will
say
that
i
don’t
want
to
interrupt
my
argument
now
but
in
the
next
case,
i
would
make
an
argument
that
in
fact,
in
fact
these
allegations
are
not
enough
to
establish
a
violation
of
the
statute.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
we
assume
for
purposes
of
this
discussion
that
there
has
been
a
violation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
assume
that
for
purposes
of
the
discussion.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
precisely
so.
that’s
precisely
our
submission
mr.
justice.
now
let
me
start
with
section
2515
which
is
set
forth
the
page
8
of
the
petitioner’s
brief
this
green
document
and
its
caption
prohibition
of
used
of
evidence
as
evidence
of
intercepted
wire
or
oral
communications
and
it
says
whenever
there
is
been
any
interception
of
an
oral
or
wire
communication
no
part
of
the
contents
of
such
communication,
and
no
evidence
derived
there
from
may
be
received
in
evidence
in
any.
and
then
there’s
a
larger
group
of
proceedings
any
trial,
any
hearing
before
any
grand
jury,
before
any
legislative
committee
or
any
authority
of
the
united
states
etcetera,
etcetera
if
a
disclosure
of
that
information
would
be
in
violation
of
the
statute.
now
this
statute
provides
the
standard.
it
contains
the
basic
prohibition
upon
the
received
in
evidence
of
material
in
violation
of
the
statute.
however,
it
does
not
explain
the
procedures
by
which
this
right
is
to
be
implemented
and
the
procedures
for
implementing
this
right
as
contained
in
section
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
would
seem
to
with
one
qualification
which
i
just
like
to
make
for
qualification
but
not
argue
at
length
at
this
point
what
it
prohibits
is
the
precedent
evidence
of
such
material
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
or
any
fruit
if
the
disclosure
of
that
information
would
be
in
violation
of
this
chapter.
not
if
the
interception
was
in
violation
of
this
chapter
but
if
the
disclosure
would
be
in
violation
of
this
chapter
and
i
have
this
argument
which
i
make
it
to
read
that
takes
a
little
time
as
to
why
the
disclosure
was
not
but
its
starts
with
the
prohibition.
however
2518
subparagraph
10
which
is
contained
at
page
20
of
the
petitioner’s
brief
provides
the
procedures
for
motions
to
suppress
and
the
senate
committee
report
on
this
statute
and
this
is
the
only
pertinent
legislative
history
on
this
title
because
the
house
committee
report
did
not
deal
with
the
bill
in
its
present
form
so
that
the
prohibitions
of
2515,
the
prohibition
upon
the
receipt
of
the
evidence
must
of
course
be
read
in
light
of
section
2518
(10)
discussed
below
which
defines
the
class
entitled
to
make
a
motion
to
suppress.
that
is
it
does
not
--2515
itself
does
not
contain
any
operative
provision
as
to
how
the
right
provide
that
there’s
to
be
enforce.
that
is
provided
by
section
2510,
2518
(10).
and
the
senate
committee
also
said
that
section
2518
(10)
later
on
when
it
came
to
discuss
that
must
be
read
in
connection
with
section
2515
which
it
limits
in
other
words
the
right
provided
in
section
2515
is
limited
by
the
standing
provided
in
section
2515
is
limited
by
the
standing
provided
in
section
2518
(10)
and
it
also
said
that
this
latter
section
subsection
10
provides
the
remedy
for
the
right
created
in
section
2515.
so
that
it
seems
to
us
there’s
a
clear
interrelationship
between
them.
now
what
is
the
provision
of
the
remedy
provided
in
2518
(10).
well
there
are
two
striking
things
about
it.
the
list
of
proceedings
before
which
a
motion
to
suppress
may
be
made
is
the
same
as
that
in
2515
with
two
striking
exceptions.
there’s
no
provision
made
in
that
for
a
grand
jury
proceeding.
and
there
is
no
provision
for
that
in
a
--
before
a
legislative
committee.
and
the
legislative
history
we
think
shows
quite
clearly
that
this
omission
was
not
inadvertent.
that
in
fact,
congress
intentionally
decided
not
to
permit
the
making
of
these
motions
to
suppress
in
connection
with
either
a
grand
jury
proceeding
or
a
legislative
proceeding.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
say
that
it
so
mr.
justice
because
it
seems
to
us
that
it
sometimes
very
difficult
to
drive
the
line
between
someone
who
is
a
witness
and
someone
who
is
being
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
sometimes
it
is
easy
but
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct
he
could
of
course
object
to
the
introduction
of
any
evidence
at
the
trial
against
him
based
on
an
illegal
interception.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that’s
correct
mr.
justice.
the
committee,
the
senate
committee
in
describing
this
subsections
stated
as
follows:
because
no
person
is
a
party
as
such
to
a
grand
jury
proceeding.
the
provision
does
not
envision
the
making
of
a
motion
to
suppress
in
the
context
of
such
a
proceeding
itself.
normally,
there’s
no
limitation
on
the
character
of
evidence
that
may
be
presented
to
a
grand
jury
which
is
enforceable
by
an
individual
citing
blue
against
united
states.
there
is
no
intention
to
change
this
general
rule.
it
is
the
intention
of
the
provision
only
that
when
a
motion
to
suppressed
is
granted
in
another
context
and
that
we
think
is
an
articulation
of
a
basic
principal
i
have
discussed
and
announced
in
silverthorne.
when
a
motion
to
suppress
is
granted
in
another
context
its
scope
may
include
use
in
a
future
grand
jury
proceeding.
nor
is
there
any
intention
to
grant
jurisdiction
to
federal
courts
over
the
congress
itself
and
of
course
if
the
petition
is
a
correct
that
this
provision
permits
a
witness
before
a
grand
jury
to
challenge
the
evidence,
it
seem
the
same
total
i
think
that
a
witness
before
a
congressional
committee
could
object
to
answering
questions
before
the
committee
because
he
said
the
committee
called
me
as
a
result
of
the
evidence
obtained
through
an
illegal
wiretap.
now
the
contempt
proceeding,
the
contempt
proceeding
is
we
think
so
costly
connected
with
the
grand
jury
proceeding
that
it
can
fairly
be
said
to
raise
the
issue
in
the
language
of
the
committee
in
the
context
of
a
grand
jury
proceeding.
the
only
way
a
witness
can
be
compelled
to
testify
before
a
grand
jury
is
to
hold
them
in
civil
contempt
to
get
the
court
to
tell
the
witness
as
the
witness
was
told
in
this
case
that
they
must
stand
committed
for
the
life
of
the
grand
jury
until
they
answer
the
questions.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh!
i
have
look
i
said
mr.
justice
we
do,
i
believe
but
they
cited
in
the
brief
in
the
egan
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
egan
case
was
the
case
in
which
referred
prior
the
first
brief
and
we
do
cite
the
grand
jury
to
cases
and
discuss
them
at
pages
14
to
15
of
our
egan
brief.
we
cite
a
number
of
court
of
appeals
cases
which
have
declined
permit
this
type
of
motion
to
be
made
before
a
grand
jury.
our
brief
in
this
case
because
of
the
fact
that
in
this
case
with
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
i
am
afraid
not,
we
don’t.
now
i
would
also
like
to
turn
to
another
provision
of
the
statute
which
reflects
the
same
intention
on
the
part
of
congress
and
that
is
subsection
9
in
the
middle
of
page
20
which
has
been
referred
to
excess
the
contents
of
any
interception
--
intercepted
wire
communication
shall
not
be
received
in
evidence
or
otherwise
disclose
in
any
trial
hearing
or
other
proceeding
unless
each
party
is
given
10
days
notice
there
if
not,
two
things
about
the
language.
it
spokes
--
speaks
of
trial
hearing
or
other
proceeding
and
it
speaks
of
a
party.
ordinarily,
a
witness
is
not
viewed
as
a
party
before
the
grand
jury.
the
word
party
as
we
used
it
in
our
law
means
parties
to
a
trial.
and
once
again
the
legislative
history
the
senate
report
confirms
to
that
view
because
in
speaking
of
paragraph
9,
what
the
senate
committee
says
is
proceeding
is
intended
to
include
all
adversary
tight
hearings.
it
would
include
a
trial
itself
a
probation
revocation
proceeding
or
a
hearing
on
a
motion
for
reduction
of
sentence.
it
would
include
a
grand
jury
hearing
citing
again
blue
against
united
states.
so
once
again
it
seems
to
us
that
the
legislative
history
of
these
provisions
is
as
clear
as
can
be,
that
congress
did
not
intend
by
these
words
to
give
any
rights
to
a
witness
before
a
grand
jury.
this
suggestion
has
been
made
both
in
this
case
and
in
the
following
case
that
this
statute
is
so
clear
on
its
face.
that
no
resort
need
be
had
to
the
legislative
history,
it
is
clear
on
its
face
they
say
because
they
look
to
the
definition
of
aggrieve
party
and
they
say
that
the
people
who’ve
been
overheard
come
within
the
definition
of
aggrieve
party
therefore
that
is
the
end
of
the
matter.
well,
this
is
a
very
complicated
statute.
it
occupies,
a
text
to
this
title
alone
occupies
23
or
24
of
the
printed
pages
in
the
brief.
it’s
a
statute
that
is
certainly
not
clear
on
its
face.it’s
difficult
to
know
what
these
things
mean
and
i
think
it
is
essential
in
this
case
to
have
resort
to
the
legislative
history
to
ascertain
precisely
what
congress
was
seeking
to
do.
precisely
what
rights
congress
was
giving
to
this
people
whether
congress
was
intending
for
the
first
time
to
give
witnesses
before
the
grand
jury
the
right
to
challenge
the
introduction
of
evidence
before
it.
now
as
i
have
indicated
a
congress
did
not
leave
witnesses
in
this
situation
without
a
remedy.
congress
provided
an
unusual
thing,
it
provide
a
specific
suit
for
damages
in
section
2520
of
the
statute.
and
this
provision
would
permit
a
witness
if
he
has
in
fact
been
injured
by
an
illegal
surveillance
to
recover
damages.
indeed,
it’s
a
rather
unusual
provision
because
it
permits
punitive
damages,
not
only
actual
damages
and
attorney’s
fees
but
punitive
damages.
now
with
this
as
far
as
the
1968
act
is
concerned,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
another
provision
which
is
a
provision
of
the
second
statute,
the
1970
statute.
the
claim
has
been
made
that
even
if
the
1968
statute
perhaps
did
not
give
these
witnesses
any
rights,
nevertheless,
the
1970
statute
did.
and
that
is
a
provision
section
3504
and
that
provision
was
the
reaction
to
this
congressional
reaction
to
this
court’s
decision
in
the
alderman
case.
congress
was
concerned
that
as
the
result
of
the
alderman
decision
there
would
be
an
enormous
increase
in
the
number
of
hearings
required
in
court
to
litigate
all
of
his
claims
of
illegal
electronic
surveillance
and
congress
attempted
to
reduce
the
number
of
those
hearings
and
what
congress
did
in
this
section
and
it
can
be
found
at
page,
the
end
of
our
brief
in
the
egan
in
this
case
--
sorry
none
of
our
brief
in
the
egan
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
it’s
not
in
the
green
brief
mr.
justice.
it
is
in
the
government’s
brief
in
the
next
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
egan
at
pages
33
to
34
and
this
provision
contains
three
subsections
and
i
would
like
in
order
to
explain
it
first
to
discuss
the
last
two
and
then
come
to
the
first
one
because
the
only
one
they
can
rely
on
is
the
first
one.
the
last
two
provisions
said
as
follows:
that
would
respect
to
any
electronic
surveillance
taking
place
before
june
19,
1968
and
that
was
the
effective
date
of
title
3
of
the
1968
act.
they
shall
not
be
required
any
hearing
with
respect
to
the
validity
of
that
surveillance
unless
the
information
brought
to
bear
may
be
relevant
to
the
claim
of
inadmissibility
of
the
evidence.
that
was,
i
read
congressional
concern
that
people
would
make
all
sorts
of
allegations
that
they
may
have
been
some
kind
of
a
taint
and
that
as
a
result
of
that
taint,
the
evidence
would
be
rendered
and
admissible.
then
they
went
on
beyond
that
and
said
that
in
any
of
that
if
there
was
electronic
surveillance
before
the
june
1968
date
and
the
surveillance
occurred
more
than
five
years
prior
to
the
conduct
to
this
--
at
issue
on
the
case.
there
was
to
be
no
consideration
otherwise
any
possible
taint
of
an
electronics
surveillance
that
occurred
more
than
five
years
before
the
time
at
which
the
evidence
of
violation
--
evidence
of
violations
involved
that
was
to
attenuate
it.
so
it
started
that
was
the
basic
purpose
of
the
statute.
then,
what
its
said
was
in
any
trial,
hearing
or
other
proceeding
you
know
before
any
court,
grand
jury
etcetera,
etcetera.
this
language
does
include
the
word
grand
jury.
it
does
not
include
the
word
legislative
committee
and
it
says
upon
a
claim
by
a
party
aggrieved
that
evidence
is
inadmissible
because
it
is
the
primary
product
of
an
unlawful
act
and
unlawful
act
is
defined
in
the
statute
to
mean
electronic
surveillance
the
government
shall
affirm
or
deny
that
allegation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
third
circuit
presents
basically
the
same
issue
as
was
before
the
court
in
the
last
case.
it
arises,
however,
in
different
factual
kind,
a
different
factual
context
in
two
respects.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
we
do
mr.
justice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
we
don’t
cite
davis
versus
mississippi.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
have
--
we’ve
dealt
with
it
mr.
justice
as
early
as
we
thought
was
necessary
to
set
forth
the
law
in
this
area.
perhaps,
we
should
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
think
mr.
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
be
happy
to
mr.
justice.
we
think
the
law
of
this
court
as
of
today
is
that
witnesses
do
not
have
the
(inaudible).
we
think
that
we’ve
cited
cases
for
example,
costello
and
blue
which
recognized
the
broad
role
of
the
grand
jury
and
the
fact
that
evidence
improperly
obtained
before
the
grand
jury
is
not
(inaudible)
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
the
blair
case,
which
unfortunately
we
have
mis-described
as
the
civil
liberties
union
points
out,
it
did
not
involve
the
fourth
amendment,
but
it
did
announce
the
principle
that
a
witness
before
grand
jury
could
not
even
challenge
the
constitutionality
(voice

mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
be
(voice
overlap)
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
be
happy
to
submit
such
memorandum
mr.
justice.
now,
the
two
distinctions
factually
between
this
case
and
the
preceding
case
is
this.
in
the
preceding
case,
there
was
conceivably
court-authorized
surveillance
and
the
government
acknowledged
that
the
petitioners
there
had
been
overheard
on
that
surveillance.
in
this
case,
the
government
has
never
admitted
any
surveillance
and
indeed,
in
it’s
brief
in
this
court,
it
denies
that
surveillance
took
place.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
have
taken
the
position
there
is
no
(voice
overlap).
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
only
mr.
justice,
3504
requires
it
only
if
3504
applies
in
the
case
of
a
witness
before
a
grand
jury.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
it
does
except
mr.
justice
(voice
overlap)
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
say
that
there
was
no
--
if
i
may
say,
there
was
no
overhearing
of
either
of
these
witnesses.
we
do
not
take
any
position
on
whether
somebody
is
telling
(voice
overlap).
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
--
the
court
of
appeals
decided
this
case
on
the
assumption
that
in
fact,
there
was
overhearing
because
the
government
had
not
denied.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
hopefully,
but
in
some
situations,
the
district
courts
in
some
of
these
cases
have
said
for
example
that
the
affidavit
that
was
submitted
denying
the
overhearing
wasn’t
sufficient
and
there’d
been
situations
in
which
despite
that,
they’ve
been
(voice
overlap)
the
proceeding.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
all
i
can
say
mr.
justice
is
that
we
did
not
take
any
position
on
this
before
the
lower
courts
because
it
was
our
view
that
the
witnesses
were
not
entitled.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
but
it’s
not
quite
that.
let
me
say
that
the
(voice
overlap).
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
because
all
i
can
answer
mr.
justice
is
that
the
government
in
this
cases
has
taken
--
consistently
taken
the
position
in
this
type
of
situation
that
a
witness
has
no
right
to
challenge
this
question
and
the
respondents
(voice

mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
the
respondents
had
concurred.
they
now
object
to
this
statement
on
our
part
and
say
they
might
be
hearing
on
(voice
overlap)
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it’s
also
mr.
justice.
it’s
not
quite
as
that
simple
matter
for
the
government
in
these
situations
every
time
a
witness
makes
this
claim
to
be
able
to
answer
then
and
there
there
has
or
hasn’t
been
overhearing.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
assume
so.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
so.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i’m
sorry.
in
what
context
was
this?
i’m
sorry.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
a
motion
to
suppress,
i
would
think
the
government
would
deny
it,
but
it
seems
if
that
would
be
i
assume
an
independent
motion
to
suppress.
let
me
put
the
case
if
i
may
(voice

mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
deny?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
we
do
deny
it.
yes,
we
do.
we
said
there
has
been
no
overhearing
of
either
of
these
two
ladies.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don’t
know
when
we
found
it
out
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
assume
that
when
this
demand
was
made,
this
triggered
an
investigation
and
at
some
point
in
the
proceedings,
we
concluded
that
there
was
no
basis
to
think
(voice
overlap).
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
one
problem
in
the
face
of
this
case,
in
this
case
as
distinguished
from
other
cases,
the
claim
is
now
made
that
they
deny
this.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
the
issue
of
course
is
before
the
court
in
the
preceding
case.
and
in
this
case,
whether
we
have
this
decision
off
the
court
of
appeals,
that
was
based
on
the
assumption
that
there
had
been
illegal
wire
tapping.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
if
you
vacated
the
judgment,
i
think
it
still
have
the
precedent
standing.
it
will
be
weakened
a
good
bit.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it’s
perhaps
an
advisory
opinion
though
i
suspect
we’ll
have
considerable
impact
before
the
third
circuit
and
while
the
district
court
is
in
the
third
circuit.
now,
(voice

mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
case
of
controversy
is
what
(voice
overlap).
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
the
case
of
controversy
mr.
justice
is
whether
or
not
these
witnesses
were
properly
held
in
contempt
for
refusing
to
answer
the
questions.
that’s
the
case
of
controversy
and
that
depends
on
whether
they
were
required
to
answer
the
questions
in
the
face
of
their
claim
of
illegal
electronic
surveillance.
that
seem
to
me
is
the
case
of
controversy
and
there
still
is
a
controversy.
they
still,
i’m
sure
when
the
counsel
gets
up
will
vigorously
deny
that
they
had
any
obligation
and
they
will
say,
i
am
sure
that
despite
the
government’s
denial,
they’re
entitled
with
hearing
before
they
had
to
testify.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
agree.(voice
overlap)
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
cannot
find
any
objection
to
doing
that
except
all
i
can
say
mr.
justice
to
that
is
that
(voice
overlap).
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
opinion
is
still
there
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
decided
it
on
that
basis.
the
court
of
appeals
then
has
to
rule
in
this
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
court
of
appeals
announced
the
rule
in
this
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
court
of
appeals
said,
it
amended
its
opinion
subsequently
to
read
as
follows,
it
says,
“since”
(voice
overlap).
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
is
from
an
addendum
to
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
which
is
contained
in
sister
egan’s
brief
in
opposition
in
this
case
at
page
16.
it’s
this
white
document.
and
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
was,
“since
sister
egan
has
not
yet
been
afforded
a
hearing
regarding
her
allegations
of
illegal
electronic
surveillance
by
the
government,
for
the
purpose
of
this
appeal,
we
assume
her
allegations
to
be
true.”
so
the
court
of
appeals
seems
to
have
announced
a
rule
that
where
the
government
has
not
denied
these
allegations,
the
case
will
be
decided
on
the
basis
that
those
allegations
are
true
and
it
proceeded
to
decide
the
case
on
that
basis.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that’s
the
normal
rules
of
pleading.
now,
the
other
aspect
of
this
case
is
that
unlike
mr.
gelbard
or
mr.
parnas,
both
of
these
two
ladies
before
being
called
before
the
grand
jury
was
given
full
transactional
immunity,
not
the
narrowly
used
immunity,
but
the
full
transactional
immunity,
which
means
that
neither
of
these
witnesses
could
be
subject
to
any
criminal
prosecution
or
penalty
for
any
testimony
they
gave.
the
facts
with
respect
to
both
of
these
ladies
are
very
similar.
in
january
1971,
sister
egan
who
is
a
catholic
nun
and
the
other
respondent,
ms.
walsh
is
not,
was
subpoenaed
to
appear
before
a
grand
jury
sitting
in
harrisburg,
pennsylvania
investigating
various
alleged
violations
of
the
criminal
code.
this
is
the
same
grand
jury
that
returned
the
indictment
in
the
barragan
case,
the
first
indictment
in
that
case
was
returned
two
days
before
and
sister
egan
was
named
as
an
un-indicted
co-conspirator.
sister
egan
appeared
before
the
grand
jury
and
refused
to
answer
any
questions
claiming
that
this
would
violate
her
rights
under
the
fifth
amendment.
and
following
this,
she
was
first
given
more
limited
so
called
used
immunity
and
then
the
day
after
when
it
became
apparent
to
the
government
that
she
would
continue
to
assert
her
privilege
under
the
firth
amendment,
she
was
given
the
full
transactional
immunity.
she
was
then
called
before
the
grand
jury
and
refused
to
answer
any
questions
other
than
giving
her
name
and
her
address.
she
was
asked
and
refused
to
answer
approximately
70
or
80
other
questions
and
following
her
refusal,
the
district
court
held
her
in
civil
contempt
and
ordered
her
committed
until
she
purged
the
content.
she
gave
six
different
grounds
for
refusing
to
answer
the
questions
and
the
pertinent
one
set
forth
at
page
54
of
the
record
here,
which
this
is
the
provision
relating
to
the
alleged
illegal
wiretaps,
it’s
number
four
in
the
top
of
page
54.
she
said,
“the
evidence
on
the
basis
of
which
i
have
been
named
as
a
non-indicted
co-conspirator,
subpoenaed
to
testify
and
answer
questions
was
secured
by
illegal
wiretaps.
in
addition,
all
or
some
of
the
telephone
communications
monitored
by
the
united
states
government,
involved
communications
within
the
roman
catholic
church
of
america
and
specifically,
between
my
provincial
headquarters
and
the
offices
of
the
church
in
new
york,
rome
and
throughout
the
united
states.”
the
second
witness,
ms.
walsh
was
called
before
the
grand
jury
in
april
of
1971
three
months
later.
she
was
intentionally
given
full
transactional
immunity.
she
refused
to
answer
all
the
questions
put
to
her
before
the
grand
jury
and
the
same
thing
happened.
both
of
these
ladies
were
therefore
held
in
civil
contempt.
a
divided
third
circuit
reversed
by
a
vote
of
five
to
three.
all
members
of
the
court,
all
five
judges
agreed
that
the
1968
act
gave
a
witness
before
a
grand
jury
the
right
to
challenge
the
evidence,
which
led
the
grand
jury
to
call
the
witness.
in
addition,
two
of
the
judges
also
believed
that
the
fourth
amendment
gave
the
witnesses
this
right.
the
government’s
arguments
in
this
case
are
substantially
the
same
as
those,
which
was
made
in
the
last
case
both
on
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
under
the
statue.
and
i
would
therefore
like
to
turn
briefly
to
the
argument
that
i
was
making
when
the
court
--
of
the
argument
on
the
previous
case
was
terminated
and
that
is
the
applicability
of
section
3504
to
this
claim.
3504
is
set
forth
in
our
brief
in
the
egan
case
at
page
33
and
i
had
previously
indicated
that
what
it
did
was
to
limit
the
total
amount
of
hearings
that
would
be
required
in
cases
of
electronic
surveillance
occurring
prior
to
1968.
we
have
that
cut
off
date.
and
then
it
goes
on
and
say,
if
there’s
any
hearing
before
a
grand
jury
upon
a
claim
by
a
party
of
aggrieved,
that
evidence
is
inadmissible
because
it
is
the
primary
product
of
an
unlawful
act
defined
as
electronic
surveillance
or
the
exploitation
of
such
act.
the
opponent
of
the
claim
shall
affirm
or
deny
the
occurrence
of
the
alleged
unlawful
act.
now,
although
this
refers
to
the
making
of
such
a
claim
at
a
proceeding
before
a
grand
jury,
the
claim
to
be
entertained
must
be
made
by
a
party
aggrieved
and
in
discussing
this
section,
the
legislative
history
speaks
of
someone
who
makes
a
claim,
speaks
of
a
claim
by
a
defendant,
it
uses
the
word
by
a
defendant
withstanding
to
challenge
the
unfair
practices.
a
defendant
is
ordinarily
not
viewed
as
someone
who
is
a
witness
before
a
grand
jury.
and
furthermore,
standing
comes
again
to
the
question
i
have
previously
discussed
as
to
whether
or
not,
whether
or
not
a
mere
witness
before
a
grand
jury
has
standing.
and
it
seems
to
us
would
be
most
anomalous
we
think
that
the
congress,
which
in
this
statute
in
1970
was
attempting
to
reduce
the
volume
of
litigation
growing
out
of
claims
of
illegal
electronic
surveillance,
would
at
the
same
time
have
given
to
grand
jury
witnesses
a
right
to
challenge
evidence
before
a
grand
jury
that
they
didn’t
have
under
the
1968
act.
we
think
that
the
whole
basic
purpose
of
this
statute
was
to
reduce
the
amount
of
litigation
relating
to
surveillances
taking
place
before
june
1968.
and
indeed,
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
senator
mcclellan
stated
that
this
section
was
limited
to
surveillance
that
occurred
prior
to
june
1968.
and
of
course,
we
deny
surveillance,
but
if
there
was
any
surveillance
in
the
case,
it
would
appear
that
it
would
took
place
before
that
date.
now,
i
would
like
to
now
turn
to
another
argument
in
this
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
assume,
i
think
with
fair
reading
of
this
is
if
the
government
denies
it,
presumably
that’s
the
end
of
it
unless
(voice
overlap).
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
doesn’t
say
so.
but
it
does
go
on
then
to
say
that
in
the
event
--
presumably
if
the
government
admits
it,
it
then
goes
on
it
seems
to
me
--
and
that
i
think
is
a
preliminary
determination.
the
first
thing
to
find
out
is
whether
the
government
acknowledges
or
it
denies.
but
if
the
government
acknowledges
it,
(voice
overlap).
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
so,
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
then
if
the
government
acknowledges
it,
if
they
meet
the
standards
of
the
two
next
subsections,
then
you
have
a
hearing
on
it.
now,
the
argument
is
made
by
the
respondents
in
this
case
and
by
position
adopted
by
some
of
the
judges
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
it
would
violate
section
2510,
if
the
government
used
this
evidence
before
the
grand
jury,
that
is
they
say
2510
prohibits
the
use
of
any
evidence
before
the
grand
jury
if
the
evidence
is
obtained
in
violation
of
the
statute.
and
therefore,
the
argument
is
that
the
district
court
should
not
lend
its
authority
in
effect
to
permit
or
force
the
prosecutor
to
violate
the
statute
and
commit
a
crime.
i
think
this
argument
fails
to
take
adequate
account
of
the
precise
language
of
the
statute.
the
statute
says,
not
that
the
recede
in
evidence
of
any
intercepted
communication
that
is
prohibited
if
it
violates
the
statute.
what
it
says
is
it’s
prohibited
if
the
disclosure
of
that
information
would
be
in
violation
of
this
chapter.
that
is
the
prohibition
is
the
use
before
a
grand
jury
or
a
court
of
any
evidence
if
the
disclosure
of
that
would
violate
this
chapter.
that’s
in
section
2515
at
page
60
of
the
egan
brief.
now,
i’ve
shifted
to
the
egan,
of
the
respondent's
egan’s
brief.
so
therefore,
we
must
look
to
other
sections
of
the
statute
to
ascertain
what
disclosure
is
prohibited
and
the
prohibitions
on
disclosure
are
contained
in
2511,
which
begins
at
page
53
of
the
egan’s
brief
and
the
critical
sections
or
subsections
c
and
d
on
page
54
and
they
prohibit
willful
disclosure
or
willful
use
of
any
intercepted
communication
knowing
or
having
reason
to
know
that
the
information
was
obtained
through
the
interception
in
violation
of
this
subsection.
that
is
disclosure
is
only
illegal
it
seems
to
us
if
in
fact
the
person
using
it
knew
or
had
reason
to
know.
now,
in
this
case,
assuming
arguendo
was
an
interception
here,
there's
another
provision
of
this
statute.
subsection
3
at
pages
55
to
56
which
was
before
this
court
several
months
ago
in
the
keith
(ph)
case
which
is
us
against
united
states
district
court
at
subsection
3,
at
pages
55
to
56
which
says
nothing
in
this
chapter
shall
limit
the
constitutional
power
of
the
precedence,
about
halfway
down
to
first
full
paragraph
on
page
6,
to
take
such
measures
as
he
deems
necessary
to
protect
the
united
states
against
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
or
violence
or
other
unlawful
means
or
against
any
clear
and
present
danger
to
the
structure
or
existence
of
the
government.
and
it
goes
on
and
says
the
contents
of
any
communication
intercepted
by
authority
of
the
president
and
the
exercise
of
the
foregoing
powers
maybe
received
in
evidence
in
any
trials
here
and
the
other
proceeding
only
when
such
interception
was
reasonable.
our
position
is
that
as
long
as
it
has
not
been
definitively
determined
that
the
interception
without
a
warrant
in
national
security
cases
is
illegal
and
the
court
of
course
will
decide
that
in
the
keith
(ph)
case
at
least
as
long
as
that
is
the
situation,
the
prosecutor
could
not
be
charged
with
knowing
or
having
reason
to
know
that
any
evidence
obtained
as
a
result
of
an
allegedly
illegal
interception
of
anyone’s
telephone
conversation
in
this
field,
that
the
disclosure
of
that
would
be
in
violation
because
the
prosecutor
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
had
every
reason
to
believe
that
at
least
at
that
point,
it
was
permissible
to
conduct
any
such
electronic
surveillance.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
fact,
it’s
more
applicable
in
the
last
case
and
it’s
clear
in
the
last
case,
it
seems
to
me
that
a
prosecutor
who
knows
that
the
interception
has
resulted
from
an
order
of
the
district
court
cannot
be
charged
with
knowing
or
having
reason
to
know
that
it
is
in
fact
illegal
because
of
some
allegations
that
there
were
some
irregularities
in
the
thing.
i
mean
(voice
overlap).
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that’s
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
correct
mr.
justice.
and
then
in
conclusion,
i
just
like
to
say
one
other
thing
which
is
in
this
whole
area,
that
it's
very
easy
for
witnesses
before
a
grand
jury
to
make
allegations
that
they
have
been
subjected
to
illegal
wire
tapping.
that
is
coming
all
the
time.
the
allegation
is
that
they’ve
been
subjected
to
illegal
wire
tapping.
in
this
case,
at
page
87
and
88
of
the
record
is
a
motion
made
by
ms.
walsh
for
disclosure
of
electronic
surveillance
and
there's
a
long
list
of
things
she
wanted
to
have
disclosed.
items
one
to
z,
various
things
and
it’s
not
easy
for
the
government
to
answer
these
questions.
if
for
example,
a’s
telephone
were
tapped,
over
the
period
of
a
week,
they
might
hear
hundreds
of
telephone
(voice
overlap).
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
precisely.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
think
that’s
what
the
statute
provides
and
we
think
the
witness
before
the
grand
jury
is
fully
protected.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
because
once
this
issue
was
decided
mr.
justice
by
this
court
whether
or
not
a
witness
is
an
aggrieved
person,
it
seems
to
me,
that
will
end
that
aspect
of
the
litigation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i’d
just
like
to
say
that
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
think
it's
important
to
look
at
the
page
46
of
the
government’s
petition.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
is
in
this
case,
in
the
egan
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
46
of
the
government’s
petition
which
contains
the
opinions
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
the
very
last
sentence
of
the
opinion
says,
“the
judgment
of
contempt
will
be
vacated
and
the
case
remanded
for
a
hearing
to
determine
whether
the
questions
propounded
to
sister
egan
resulted
from
illegal
electronic
surveillance
directed
at
her.”
so
that
(voice
overlap)
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
the
contempt
has
been
vacated
because
the
court
of
appeals
has
reversed
the
district
court’s
decision
in
determination
of
contempt
and
has
said
that
sister
egan
was
entitled
to
litigate
this
issue
