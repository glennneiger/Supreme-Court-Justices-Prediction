unknown
speaker
challenge
the
evidence
or
declined
to
answer
questions?
unknown
speaker
the
grand
jury
is
trying
to
adduce
evidence
by
getting
this
witness
to
answer
questions.
now
what
he
was
doing
is
--
these
two
gentlemen
were
doing
was
refusing
to
answer
questions,
isn’t
that
right?
unknown
speaker
not
challenging
evidence,
they
were
asked
to
give
evidence.
unknown
speaker
what
evidence?
i
am
a
little
confused
that
say
you,
talking
about
challenging
evidence,
they
were
called
in
order
to
give
evidence
and
you
say
that
they
can
challenge
it
when
the
evidence
is
sought
to
be
used
against
them,
now
you
are
talking
now
about
their
own
answers
to
those
questions?
unknown
speaker
mr.
friedman
do
we
reach
these
issues
you
are
now
moving
at
this
juncture.
don’t
we
reach
them
only
after
we
consider
the
statutory
ground?
unknown
speaker
let’s
assume,
let’s
assume
to
the
moment
that
we
are
determined
that
the
disclosure
in
the
grand
jury
is
contrary
to
statute
and
we
wouldn’t
never
--
we
wouldn't
reach
silverthorne
or
any
other
constitution.
unknown
speaker
i
want
to
make
sure
that
what
make
that
--
what
you’re
addressing
yourself
to.
this
is
on
the
assumption.
we
must
assume
that
this
juncture
that
attack
is
illegal
under
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
now,
we
are
assuming
that
the
provisions
of
the
statute
were
not
complied
with
in
authorizing
the
interception.
that’s
the
assumption
we
make.
unknown
speaker
and
nevertheless
you
say
--
and
nevertheless
you
say
the
statute
does
not
permit
or
does
not
anticipate
exclusion
of
the
grand
jury.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
and
that
this
was
an
illegal
interception.
unknown
speaker
and
nevertheless,
you
say
congress
did
not
provide
for
an
exclusionary
rule
or
a
rule
against
the
used
of
the
fruits
of
that
attack.
unknown
speaker
well,
that’s
all
you
had
on
its
face.
it
leads
right
on
this
situation,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
or
any
fruits?
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
that
both
with
respect
to
a
--
neither
to
that
has
of
the
witness
nor
of
a
person
who
is
being
investigated?
unknown
speaker
sometime
it’s
easy
though.
unknown
speaker
even
when
it’s
easy
the
–
it’s
good
if
defendants
themselves
would
not
either
then
or
later
claim
that
his
indictment
was
illegal
because
it
rested
on
illegal
interception.
unknown
speaker
right,
right
but
actually
he
couldn’t
tell
them
this
indictment.
unknown
speaker
it’s
interesting
you
do
not
cite
any
of
the
fourth
amendment
cases
given
in
the
grand
jury
in
your
brief.
unknown
speaker
oh
i
see!
unknown
speaker
did
you,
in
the
other
brief
you
deal
with
dionisio
case
of
the
seventh
circuit?
unknown
speaker
it
is
on
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
but
it
doesn’t
necessary
follow
in
every
case?
unknown
speaker
government's
trial
should
maintain.
unknown
speaker
let
assume
one
where
it
doesn’t.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
hasn’t
left
the
department’s
view
on
the
fourth
amendment
(voice
overlap).
unknown
speaker
the
grand
jury
case
is
(voice
overlap)
unknown
speaker
i
know.
that
is
fine
but
there
wouldn’t
have
been
any
questions
to
be
decided
if
the
government
had
said
there
wasn’t
any
overhearing
anyway.
there
wouldn’t
have
been
--
this
case
would
never
have
been
here?
unknown
speaker
i
know
but
the
district
judge
would
have
decided
one
way
or
another,
wouldn't
he,
whether
there
was
or
not?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
wouldn’t
the
issue
have
been
trashed
out
in
a
district
court
if
there
had
been
an
issue
made
of
it?
unknown
speaker
and
the
district
court
would’ve
decided
it.
they
may
have
been
decided
it
for
you
and
if
you
have,
this
case
would’ve
never
been
done
here.
unknown
speaker
so
when
a
witness
says
or
when
a
person
makes
his
motion
for
disclosure
as
in
this
case
and
says,
“i
am
an
aggrieved
person
b,
please
disclose.”
you
may
deny
that
they’re
an
aggrieved
person
and
until
that
is
settled,
even
though
it
involves
an
appeal
here,
you
don’t
have
to
disclose.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
challenge
the

or
declined
to
answer

unknown

the
