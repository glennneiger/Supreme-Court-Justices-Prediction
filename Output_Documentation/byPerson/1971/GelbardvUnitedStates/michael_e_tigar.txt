mr.
michael
e.
tigar
mr.
chief
justice
burger
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
seek
in
its
argument
to
show
on
constitutional
and
statutory
premises
that
the
opinion
below
is
an
unwarranted
assault
on
settled
principles,
personal
liberty
and
would
permit
the
government
to
violate
the
law
without
paying
the
price
for
doing
so.
the
issue
if
the
court
please
is
whether
a
grand
jury
witness,
under
compulsion
to
testify,
may
prevent
the
use
of
wiretap
material
obtained
in
violation
of
his
or
her
rights
against
him
or
her
in
the
grand
jury
proceeding.
the
facts
are
these,
david
gelbard
and
sidney
parnas
were
subpoenaed
to
appear
before
a
federal
grand
jury
in
los
angeles
in
february
1971.
they
became
aware
that
they
had
been
overheard
on
a
court
ordered
wiretap,
conducted
under
the
provisions
of
the
1968
omnibus
crime
bill.
the
government
conceded
that
it
intended
to
use
the
transcripts
of
petitioner’s
overheard
conversations
to
refresh
petitioner’s
recollection
and
to
formulate
questions
to
them
before
the
grand
jury,
thus
the
government
admits
that
it
intended
to
disclose
or
cause
disclosure
of
overheard
conversations
of
these
petitioners.
petitioners
claim
that
the
taps
were
illegal
and
refused
to
answer
questions
until
they
were
afforded
a
hearing
at
which
the
legality
issue
could
be
determined
and,
under
what
the
government
terms
in
its
brief
in
the
egan
case,
the
constitutional
rule
of
silverthorne,
the
government
foreclosed
from
disclosing
this
material
in
questioning
petitioners.
the
district
court
denied
a
hearing
and
ordered
petitioners
summarily
committed
for
civil
contempt.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
and
this
court
granted
certiorari.
our
argument
embraces
three
points
if
the
court
please.
first,
if
disclosure
is
permitted
before
the
grand
jury
in
questioning
these
petitioners,
they
will
suffer
a
harm
of
which
the
law
can
take
notice.
second,
there
is
a
remedy,
constitutional,
inherent
power
and
statutory
for
this
harm
and
third,
i’d
like
to
deal
with
the
implications,
the
government’s
position
here.
the
government
says
in
its
brief
that
the
harm
that
one
suffers
from
being
the
victim
of
a
wiretap
is
ended
when
the
tap
is
disconnected.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
is
ended
when
the
tap
is
disconnected,
that
is
mr.
justice
stewart
that
there
is
no
further
harm
from
disclosing
this
material,
even
assuming
it
was
illegally
overheard.
this
is
not
the
rule
that
this
court
has
established,
it
is
not
the
rule
for
example
of
silverthorne
versus
united
states,
of
gelbard
importing
company
versus
united
states,
and
although
the
case
rests
on
statutory
premises
nardone
versus
united
states,
rio
versus
united
states
and
other
cases
decided
by
this
court.
it
is
not
the
rule
as
established
in
such
an
elementary
treaties
is
passed
around
the
torts
which
identifies
public
disclosure
of
private
facts
is
a
crucial
element
of
the
tort
law
right
of
privacy.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
yes,
mr.
chief
justice
it
was.
it
was
in
both
cases
we
have
court
ordered
wiretaps
in
which
a
determination
of
probable
cause
was
made
against
other
persons
than
the
petitioners,
the
petitioners
wandered
in
to
the
ambit
of
these
court
ordered
wiretaps.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
i
was
just
coming
to
that
mr.
chief
justice
because
the
third
kind
of
harm
we’re
talking
about
here
is
the
statutory
harm
under
the
very
act,
under
which
the
warrants
were
issued,
that
is
to
say
section
2511
of
title
18
makes
it
a
federal
crime
to
disseminate
information
unlawfully
obtained
by
wiretapping
and
electronic
surveillance.
thus,
the
petitioners
would
be
victims
of
such
a
federal
crime
before
the
grand
jury
and
indeed
looking
at
2510
through
2520
of
title
18,
one
can
see
that
the
quid
pro
quo
which
congress
accepted
for
granting
this
broad
power
to
tap
and
bug
was
a
set
of
very
detailed
limitations
upon
the
manner
in
which
this
material
is
to
be
used.
with
then,
there
is
harm
here
to
the
petitioners,
what
is
the
remedy?
the
government,
if
the
court
please,
concedes
at
page
23
of
its
brief
in
the
egan
case
which
it
adopts
as
its
brief
in
our
case.
that
if
there
was
a
pre-subpoena,
adjudication
that
these
taps
were
illegal,
the
court,
in
adjudicating
them
illegal,
under
what
it
aptly
terms,
the
constitutional
rule
of
silverthorne
would
and
could
prohibit
the
government
from
using
this
illegally
obtained
material
against
these
petitioners
in
this
very
grand
jury
proceeding,
that
is
petitioners
could
hire
a
lawyer,
file
a
civil
suit
under
the
authority
of
go-bart
importing
company,
or
rio
against
united
states
or
the
bivens
case
decided
in
this
court,
short
time
ago
and
invoked
a
consistent
course
of
federal
decision
going
back
60
years
to
wise
versus
henkel,
in
220
u.s.
they
would
claim
that
the
inherent
power
of
the
federal
court
could
be
used
reaching
out
the
federal
equity
power
to
enjoin
the
government
for
making
use
of
this
material.
of
course,
as
this
court
has
heard
this
morning,
an
argument
in
tatum
case,
the
government
might
claim
in
such
a
civil
suit
that
the
case
was
not
right
for
an
injunction
to
issue,
that
is
if
the
petitioners
could
not,
before
they
have
received
the
subpoena,
demonstrate
the
kind
of
immediate
harm
that
the
federal
equity
power
has
customarily
used
to
protect
against.
but
petitioner’s
case,
if
the
court
please,
could
not
be
more
right,
and
that
is
why
it
is
incredible
to
us
that
the
government
won’t
go
the
last
six
inches
with
us,
since
they
have
agreed
on
just
about
everything
else
and
say
that
when
the
petitioners
are
standing
in
the
jail
house
door
that
surely
they
have
a
right
to
prevent
the
use
against
them
of
this
material.
they
are
not,
the
petitioners
are
not,
like
the
defendant
in
the
case
of
blue
against
united
states.
in
the
position
of
a
gratuitous
intervener
in
the
grand
jury,
who
merely
suspects
that
here
she
is
being
talked
about
in
the
secrecy
of
the
grand
jury
room
and
wants
to
stop
the
grand
jury’s
process.
no,
they
are
standing
in
the
jailhouse
door
because
the
material
the
government
admits
is
going
to
be
used
against
them
in
the
grand
jury
room.
so
this
case
is
no
different,
from
asking
a
district
court
to
sustain
any
other
claim
of
privilege,
any
other
claim
of
privacy
protecting
privilege
if
the
court
please,
at
the
behest
of
any
other
grand
jury
witness,
in
any
other
grand
jury,
in
any
federal
court
in
the
land.
in
this
connection,
we
ask
the
court
to
note,
as
i
mentioned
before
to
the
petitioners
are
after
all,
if
this
tap
is
illegal,
being
made
the
victim
of
a
federal
crime
and
they’re
in
the
grand
jury
room.
and
so
the
government
asks
this
court
to
break
the
promise
which
this
court
made,
in
the
alderman
case
in
two
ways.
first,
by
negating
what
alderman
termed
the
constitutional
rule
that
forbids
using
the
fruits
of
unlawful
tapping
against
persons
who,
like
the
petitioners
are
agreed
and
second,
they
want
to
undermine
alderman
by
urging
this
court
to
permit
the
government
to
commit
the
federal
crime
detailed
in
section
2511
and
in
this
court’s
words,
to
let
those
who
flop
the
rules
go
unscathed
and
to
cavalierly
disregard
the
rights
of
the
person
done
with
the
act.
so
this
court
can
decide
this
case
based
on
elementary
principles
of
equity
jurisprudence
with
some
attention
to
the
mandate
of
the
fourth
amendment
in
protecting
the
right
of
privacy,
and
some
attention
to
the
inherent
power
in
the
words
of
wise
versus
henkel
of
the
district
court
to
protect
against
abuse
of
its
process
by
its
officers.
the
constitution
surely
requires
no
less,
but
there
is,
as
two
courts
of
appeals,
one
of
them
en
bank
have
held
a
statutory
ground
of
decision,
which
is
available
to
the
court
in
this
case.
a
1968
act,
sections
2510
through
2520
of
title
18
provide
for
notice,
for
hearing,
and
for
suppression.
at
the
instance
of
those
who
like
petitioners,
are
about
to
be
harmed
by
surveillance
against
them.
section
2515
of
the
act
forbids
the
use
of
material
unlawfully
obtained
in
any
court
or
grand
jury
proceeding.
section
2518
of
the
act
in
subdivision
9,
requires
that
before
material
obtained
under
the
act
is
to
be
used
against
a
person,
there
must
be
ten
days
notice
given
to
that
person.
other
way
this
is
one
answer
to
the
government’s
contention
that
our
position
here
is
going
to
sabotage
grand
juries.
the
government
knew
it
was
going
to
use
the
fruits
of
this
tapping
against
mr.
gelbard
and
mr.
parnas.
if
they
had
sent
ten
days
before
that
grand
jury
appearance
a
letter
saying
we
intend
to
use
it,
mr.
gelbard
and
parnas
could
have
come
in
to
the
district
court,
asked
the
district
judge
to
look
at
the
order
authorizing
the
tap,
gotten
the
threshold
determination
of
legality
and
illegality.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
their
conversations
are
overheard,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
the
grand
jury
investigation
mr.
chief
justice
has,
does
far
resulted
in
several
indictments.
those
are
mostly
in
the
field
of
interstate
gambling.
one
of
the
people
that’s
been
indicted,
mr.
jerome
zarowitz,
was
formerly
executive
vice
president
of
a
hotel
called
caesars
palace
in
las
vegas.
mr.
parnas
is
an
accountant
who
works
in
new
york
for
caesars
palace,
so,
so
far
as
we
can
determine,
there
is
--
there
is
some
connection
between
what
the
grand
juries
indicted
about
and
what
they
want
to
ask
mr.
parnas
about.
with
respect
to
mr.
gelbard,
the
questions
asked
that
are
reproduced
in
the
appendix
focus
on
the
allegation
to
put
it
bluntly
that
he
was
the
bagman
carrying
the
proceeds
of
illegal
interstate
gaming
between
los
angeles
and
las
vegas.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
mr.
chief
justice,
with
respect
to
mr.
parnas,
the
government
informs
us
in
a
footnote
to
its
brief
that
it
intends
to
seek
immunity
grant
for
him
if
he
should
return
to
the
grand
jury,
and
the
government
represented
below
and
does
here
that
it
has
no
intention
at
this
time
of
prosecuting
mr.
gelbard
and
mr.
parnas.
so
i
think
that
--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
if
he
were
afraid
of
a
criminal
persecution,
yes
mr.
chief
justice,
he
could
invoke
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
well
here
he
is
protecting
another
right.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
mr.
chief
justice,
he
is
of
course
afraid
of
that,
as
are
all
citizens
faced
with
government
scrutiny
of
this
kind,
but
he
is
also
seeking,
in
this
case,
in
this
proceeding,
to
protect
another
right
of
his.
the
fourth
amendment,
mr.
chief
justice
is
not
designed
solely
to
protect
guilty
criminals
and
those
who
fear
the
government
is
going
to
prove
that
they
are
guilty
criminals,
and
mr.
parnas
and
mr.
gelbard
are
seeking
an
application
of
their
fourth
amendment
rights
in
the
context
of
this
proceeding,
which
will
vindicate
their
right
of
privacy,
a
right
which
is
available
to
them
whether
or
not
they
fear
prosecution
and
whether
or
not
they
are
granted
immunity
from
prosecution
by
the
government.
they
are
thus,
in
no
different
position
from
any
person,
who
invokes
a
privacy
protecting
privilege,
in
front
of
the
grand
jury,
regardless
of
whether
he
fears
prosecution
by
the
government.
perhaps
i
can
use
an
analogy
if
i
may.
let
us
assume,
that
the
fbi,
through
stealth,
listened
beyond
on
a
conversation
between
a
penitent
and
a
priest
engaged
in
the
ritual
of
the
confession
and
that
thereafter,
the
government
called
the
penitent
before
a
grand
jury
and
sought
to
interrogate
him
or
her
about
what
had
been
heard
in
the
confessional.
in
such
a
case,
if
the
government
indicated
any
intention
to
use
the
transcript
that
the
fbi
agents
over
hearing
to
refresh
the
penitent’s
recollection
about
what
she
or
he
had
told
the
priest.
a
fair
reading
of
the
clergyman
penitent
privilege,
at
least
at
it
appears
in
such
statements
as
that
in
the
proposed
federal
rules
of
evidence,
would
it
seems
to
me
permit
the
witness
to
interpose
this
privacy
protecting
privilege,
and
so
here,
where
the
intrusion
is
illegal,
under
the
1968
act,
and
the
government
admits
that
it
intends
to
use
it.
we
say
that
the
law,
the
right
of
privacy
protects,
and
of
course
we
supplement
that
by
saying
that
irrespective
of
any
fifth
amendment
problems,
the
statute
forbids
these
material
to
be
used
in
a
way
that
the
government
plans
to
use
it.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
no,
mr.
justice
marshall
that
is
not
our
position.
the
government
could
call
mr.
parnas
and
mr.
gelbard
and
interrogate
them
about
any
subject
under
the
sun,
provided
the
district
court
has
held
that
the
tap
was
legal.
second,
if
the
district
court
-–
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
if
it’s
illegal
--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
the
congress
has
recently
legislated
with
respect
to
this
question
and
purported
to
set
up
a
cut-off
date
with
respect
to
claims
of
illegality,
but
passing
that
statutory
provision,
the
government
would
be
obliged
in
such
a
case,
merely
to
purify
its
evidence
and
to
show
that
the
questions
it
wanted
to
ask
were
either
so
far
removed
from
the
initial
illegalities
so
as
in
the
words
of
wong
sun
to
dissipate
the
taint
or
again
in
the
words
of
wong
sun,
derive
from
an
independent
source,
and
of
course
the
rule
of
wong
sun
in
this
connection
is
subsequently
been
applied
i
believe
by
its
citation
in
the
alderman
situation,
so
the
government
is
not
foreclosed
whenever
calling
them,
it
just
can’t
violate
people’s
rights
without
paying
the
price,
which
is
that
it
cannot
use
the
fruits
of
its
illegality.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
no
more
than
the
illegality
is
worth,
mr.
justice
marshall,
which
is
to
say,
they
can’t
exploit
the
wrong
that
they’ve
done,
that
is
all
the
limitation
we
want
to
put
on
the
government
in
this
case.
now,
to
all
of
this,
the
government
replies
what?
that
the
rule
which
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court
and
plain
meaning
of
the
act
established,
would
impose
too
heavy
a
burden
on
the
administration
of
criminal
justice.
there
are
two
answers
to
this
contention,
first,
that
it
isn’t
true
and
second,
we
invite
to
court
to
think
of
the
alternative.
this
was
a
tap
under
the
provisions
of
the
1968
act.
the
1968
act,
if
the
district
judge
orders
it,
gives
persons
overheard
in
these
taps
the
right
to
be
notified
for
the
fact
they
have
been
overheard,
thus,
it
requires
the
government
to
keep
records.
government
says
in
its
brief
that
in
the
remand
in
the
alderman
case,
they
spent
20
man-days
searching
through
the
records
to
see
whether
or
not
the
petitioners
there
had
been
overheard.
i
can
understand
that,
this
court
knows
from
bitter
experience
how
difficult
it
was
to
ferried
out
taps
that
the
fbi
had
conducted
and
subsequently
attempted
to
hide
even
attorneys
in
the
justice
department.
but
under
the
1968
act,
all
of
that
is
supposed
to
be
over,
there
supposed
to
be
records
kept
and
so
the
note
is
giving
function
that
the
act
makes
a
crucial
part
of
its
protection,
of
the
rights
of
the
individual
can
be
adhered
to
and
complied
with.
there
is
finally,
or
second
rather,
the
gratuitous
assertion
that
these
petitioners
are
not
trying
to
protect
their
rights,
they
are
trying
to
shield
somebody
else
that
if
they’re
really
concerned
about
themselves,
they’d
invoke
the
fifth
amendment
like
good
citizens
and
not
worry
about
all
these
privacy
argument.
they
seek,
as
i
have
mentioned
before
to
protect
their
own
right
of
privacy
as
chief
judge
sobeloff
said,
in
the
case
of
lankford
versus
gelston,
upholding
the
use
of
the
federal
equity
powered
issue
and
injunction
against
illegal
search,
it
would
be
a
grotesque
irony
if
our
courts
protect
only
against
the
unlawful
search
which
uncovers
contraband,
by
the
exclusionary
rule,
while
offering
no
relief
against
an
admittedly
unlawful
pattern
and
practice,
affecting
hundreds
of
innocent
homeowners.
thus,
we
are
saying
here
that
the
privacy
protecting
job
of
protecting
federal
district
court
isn’t
limited
to
saying
that
contraband
seized
from
somebody
who
is
proven
guilty
by
the
fact
the
contraband
was
seized,
ought
not
to
be
received
in
evidence,
that
the
privacy
protecting
function
arises
anytime
a
citizen
is
about
to
be
the
victim
of
an
invasion
of
privacy
directed
against
him
or
her,
the
government
said
in
alderman
and
then
said
it
in
this
court
and
through
the
words
of
the
solicitor
general
that
it
was
concerned
about
people
like
petitioners,
third
parties
wander
in
the
taps,
that
have
been
authorized
against
somebody
else.
we
invite
the
government
in
this
case
to
share
that
concern
that
we
have
about
these
third
parties
under
these
circumstances.
these
are
not,
if
the
court
please,
the
times
of
the
assize
clarendon
in
which
grand
juror
sat
under
a
tree
and
gossiped
about
breaches
of
the
king’s
peace.
the
grand
jury
is
a
formidable
force,
with
the
power
to
call
on
many
investigative
agencies
to
pull
people
off
the
streets
and
compel
them
to
testify.
it
may
be
used
for
investigation
and
as
a
dress
rehearsal
for
the
government’s
case
in
chief
of
trial.
it
is
the
sole
inquisitorial
element,
in
an
accusatorial
system
of
jurisprudence.
there
must
be
limits
on
its
power.
yes,
those
limits
may
slow
down
the
process
some,
as
we
say
in
our
brief,
due
process
is
always
slower
than
summary
process
or
drumhead
process
or
pistol
at
the
head
process
or
as
in
this
case
no
process
at
all.
in
conclusion,
we
say
only
that
a
great
deal
has
been
written
and
more
said
about
the
way
of
recent
congressional
legislation
on
crime.
many
see
in
these
statutes
an
unyielding
hostility
to
civil
liberty,
but
however
these
laws
may
fair
here,
when
measured
against
the
constitution,
this
court
should
surely
set
its
phase
against
any
attempt,
as
in
this
case,
to
read
out
of
those
statutes
the
precious
few
concessions
to
personal
freedom,
which
they
indisputably
contain.
the
government’s
position
here,
if
the
court
please
is
sabotaged.
it
is
sabotaged
of
the
1968
act,
sabotaged
of
a
170
years
of
this
court’s
decision
and
sabotaged
of
the
rights
of
liberty
and
personal
security.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
just
a
few
words
in
rebuttal
if
may
about
the
proper
meaning
to
describe
to
this
statutory
terms
to
which
mr.
friedman
referred.
the
government’s
positions
seems
to
be
that
only
if
the
legislative
history
is
ambiguous
need
we
read
the
statute
here.
i
invite
the
court’s
attention
first
to
section
2515
of
the
statute
which
is
at
page
8
of
the
appendix
of
our
brief.
that
section
forbids
receipt
in
evidence
in
any
trial,
hearing
or
other
proceeding
in
or
before
any
grand
jury.
a
certain
evidence
if
disclosure
would
be
in
violation
of
this
chapter
apart
of
the
this
chapter
to
which
that
statute
refers
is
surely
section
2511
which
makes
it
a
criminal
offense
to
disclose
information
obtained
in
violation
of
the
crime
control
and
safe
streets
act.
particularly,
section
2511
subdivision
1
(c)
reprinted
at
page
5
of
the
appendix
of
our
brief.
so
there
is
in
2515
not
just
a
right
but
a
remedy.
now,
the
legislative
history
if
the
court
please,
does
say
that
section
2518
subdivision
10
of
the
statute
which
has
to
do
with
notice
and
hearing
is
not
intended
to
apply
to
a
grand
jury
proceeding
and
it
cites
the
case
of
blue
versus
united
states.
we
do
not
contest
the
holding
in
blue
in
this
proceeding.
we
are
not
saying
that
a
person
indicted
has
the
right
to
challenge
the
legality
of
the
evidence
the
grand
jury
heard
and
we
are
not
saying
in
this
case
that
a
person
who
suspects
that
she
or
he
is
being
investigated
by
the
grand
jury.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
pardon?
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
i
think
mr.
justice
white
that
the
preponderant
rule
in
the
circuits
these
days
undercuts
the
broad
language
of
the
costello
case,
yes
sir.
i
think
that
when
this
court
next
gets
the
issue
that
there
would
be
a
good
argument
made
that
you
can
--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
i
think
so
mr.
justice
white
in
this
kind
of
a
case.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
if
i
am
wrong
on
that
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
we
--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
no,
we’re
not
wrong
on
this
case
because
--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
it
is
not
a
tough
line
mr.
justice
white
because
the
person
who
is
indicted
that
is
whose
made
the
defendant
who
is
never
been
called
before
the
grand
jury
has
available
of
motion
to
suppress
in
the
criminal
case
which
if
the
grand
jury
indictment
is
based
solely
on
wiretap
evidence
he
is
going
to
win
anyway
because
the
evidence
of
the
government
has
a
trial
in
all
the
evidence.
they
have
a
trial
it’s
going
to
be
suppressed.
that’s
typical
in
these
gambling
cases
where
the
government’
whole
case
is
jerry
and
nickel
on
the
bares
on
sunday,
right?
right
and
that
is
the
interstate
telephone
conversation.
it’s
a
bet.
it’s
a
violation
of
the
anti-racketeering
legislation.
that’s
the
government
whole
case;
if
that
tap
is
illegal
the
government
case
founders
the
motion
to
suppress.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
it
is
the
way
it
happens
and
that’s
why
there
are
cases
in
the
ninth
and
seventh
circuits
dismissing
indictment
because
the
evidence
before
the
grand
jury
was
illegal.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
it
doesn’t.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
it
doesn’t
necessary
follow
in
every
case.
no.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
in
that
case,
the
motion
to
suppress
in
the
criminal
case
still
gives
the
criminal
defendant
a
protection
against
the
material
being
used
against
him
or
her.
the
only
person
left
unprotected
then
in
the
government
scheme
of
things
would
be
the
grand
jury
witness
where
the
government
finds
out
about
because
of
an
illegal
bug
gets
hold
off
the
streets
and
he
is
told,
you
better
answer
these
questions
we’re
making
up.
you
better
help
in
a
disclosure
of
this
illegally
overheard
material
otherwise
you
are
going
to
go
to
jail
for
the
life
of
the
grand
jury.
that
is
my
conclusion
--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
or
one
might
be
--
one
might
be
indicted
oneself,
yes
mr.
justice
white.[audience
laughing]
the
government’s
position,
also
if
the
court
please,
is
anomalous
because
of
the
citation
of
section
2520.
the
government
says
presumably
that
mr.
parnas
and
mr.
gelbard
could
get
a
judgment
in
the
civil
case
that
they
been
illegally
overheard
that
would
be
raised
adjudicata
and
then
when
they
came
before
the
grand
jury,
i
guess
the
government
could
not
use
this
illegally
overheard
material.
but
what’s
the
difference
here?
the
only
difference
is
the
case
is
right
pertinent
would
be
if
they
came
in
and
brought
a
strike
civil
action
without
there
never
having
gotten
the
subpoena
to
appear
before
the
grand
jury.
it
is
right
because
they
are
about
to
go
jail.
this
conclusion,
mr.
justice
white
and
if
the
court
please
that
we’ve
come
to
rests
not
just
on
silverthorne
which
is
a
little
different
from
this
case
but
on
wise
versus
henkel
in
220
u.s.
and
there
this
court
said
no
uncertain
terms
that
the
district
judge
has
the
power
to
control
the
illegal
conduct
of
its
officers
and
the
execution
of
its
process.
the
rule
of
wise
versus
henkel
has
not
been
disturbed
by
any
subsequent
decision
and
nothing
in
this
statute
or
in
the
legislative
history
evinces
any
congressional
intention
to
disturb
it
in
cases
arising
under
the
1968
act.
and
so
mr.
parnas
and
mr.
gelbard
are
in
no
different
a
position
before
the
grand
jury
than
any
other
witness
who
resists
the
compulsion
to
testify
by
invoking
some
privilege
designed
to
protect
not
against
the
incrimination
but
privacy.
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
that
have
been
proposed
to
follow
such
privileges,
trade
secrets,
political
vote,
priest
penitent,
lawyer
client
and
there
are
common
law
ones
such
as
the
version
of
the
marital
privilege
mention
in
the
dissent
in
and
the
wyatt
case
and
the
diplomatic
privilege.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
if
“a”
is
a
government
agent.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
then
aside
from
his
remedy
in
the
canon
law
courts
[laughter]
which
he
would
have,
a
civil
remedy
that
“b”
would
have
would
be
against
“a”
and
since
there’s
no
state
action
involved
at
the
point
of
the
beating
there
isn’t
at
that
point
anything
that
the
law
can
take
notice
of.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
if
it’s
a
state
officer
that
beat
up
“b”
to
tell
a
story
about
“c”
then
judge
learned
hand’s
opinion
in
inri
freed
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
indicates
that
in
such
a
situation
of
federal
court
has
under
its
plenary
equity
powers
the
right
and
some
would
say
that
duty
under
appropriate
circumstances
to
intervene
to
protect
against
the
consequences.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
how?
if
“b”
had
already
testified
by
suppressing
the
use
of
that
evidence
against
“c”
if
he’d
not
by
giving
him
the
right
not
--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
he
could
bring
a
suit
citing
inri
freed
as
authority
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
well
he
could
refuse
to
testify
and
ask
that
the
court
uphold
his
claim
as
sufficient,
excuse
me,
as
the
petitioners
did
here.
thank
you.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
mr.
chief
justice
burger
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
seek
in
its
argument
to
show
on
constitutional
and
statutory
premises
that
the
opinion
below
is
an
unwarranted
assault
on
settled
principles,
personal
liberty
and
would
permit
the
government
to
violate
the
law
without
paying
the
price
for
doing
so.
the
issue
if
the
court
please
is
whether
a
grand
jury
witness,
under
compulsion
to
testify,
may
prevent
the
use
of
wiretap
material
obtained
in
violation
of
his
or
her
rights
against
him
or
her
in
the
grand
jury
proceeding.
the
facts
are
these,
david
gelbard
and
sidney
parnas
were
subpoenaed
to
appear
before
a
federal
grand
jury
in
los
angeles
in
february
1971.
they
became
aware
that
they
had
been
overheard
on
a
court
ordered
wiretap,
conducted
under
the
provisions
of
the
1968
omnibus
crime
bill.
the
government
conceded
that
it
intended
to
use
the
transcripts
of
petitioner’s
overheard
conversations
to
refresh
petitioner’s
recollection
and
to
formulate
questions
to
them
before
the
grand
jury,
thus
the
government
admits
that
it
intended
to
disclose
or
cause
disclosure
of
overheard
conversations
of
these
petitioners.
petitioners
claim
that
the
taps
were
illegal
and
refused
to
answer
questions
until
they
were
afforded
a
hearing
at
which
the
legality
issue
could
be
determined
and,
under
what
the
government
terms
in
its
brief
in
the
egan
case,
the
constitutional
rule
of
silverthorne,
the
government
foreclosed
from
disclosing
this
material
in
questioning
petitioners.
the
district
court
denied
a
hearing
and
ordered
petitioners
summarily
committed
for
civil
contempt.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
and
this
court
granted
certiorari.
our
argument
embraces
three
points
if
the
court
please.
first,
if
disclosure
is
permitted
before
the
grand
jury
in
questioning
these
petitioners,
they
will
suffer
a
harm
of
which
the
law
can
take
notice.
second,
there
is
a
remedy,
constitutional,
inherent
power
and
statutory
for
this
harm
and
third,
i’d
like
to
deal
with
the
implications,
the
government’s
position
here.
the
government
says
in
its
brief
that
the
harm
that
one
suffers
from
being
the
victim
of
a
wiretap
is
ended
when
the
tap
is
disconnected.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
is
ended
when
the
tap
is
disconnected,
that
is
mr.
justice
stewart
that
there
is
no
further
harm
from
disclosing
this
material,
even
assuming
it
was
illegally
overheard.
this
is
not
the
rule
that
this
court
has
established,
it
is
not
the
rule
for
example
of
silverthorne
versus
united
states,
of
gelbard
importing
company
versus
united
states,
and
although
the
case
rests
on
statutory
premises
nardone
versus
united
states,
rio
versus
united
states
and
other
cases
decided
by
this
court.
it
is
not
the
rule
as
established
in
such
an
elementary
treaties
is
passed
around
the
torts
which
identifies
public
disclosure
of
private
facts
is
a
crucial
element
of
the
tort
law
right
of
privacy.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
yes,
mr.
chief
justice
it
was.
it
was
in
both
cases
we
have
court
ordered
wiretaps
in
which
a
determination
of
probable
cause
was
made
against
other
persons
than
the
petitioners,
the
petitioners
wandered
in
to
the
ambit
of
these
court
ordered
wiretaps.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
i
was
just
coming
to
that
mr.
chief
justice
because
the
third
kind
of
harm
we’re
talking
about
here
is
the
statutory
harm
under
the
very
act,
under
which
the
warrants
were
issued,
that
is
to
say
section
2511
of
title
18
makes
it
a
federal
crime
to
disseminate
information
unlawfully
obtained
by
wiretapping
and
electronic
surveillance.
thus,
the
petitioners
would
be
victims
of
such
a
federal
crime
before
the
grand
jury
and
indeed
looking
at
2510
through
2520
of
title
18,
one
can
see
that
the
quid
pro
quo
which
congress
accepted
for
granting
this
broad
power
to
tap
and
bug
was
a
set
of
very
detailed
limitations
upon
the
manner
in
which
this
material
is
to
be
used.
with
then,
there
is
harm
here
to
the
petitioners,
what
is
the
remedy?
the
government,
if
the
court
please,
concedes
at
page
23
of
its
brief
in
the
egan
case
which
it
adopts
as
its
brief
in
our
case.
that
if
there
was
a
pre-subpoena,
adjudication
that
these
taps
were
illegal,
the
court,
in
adjudicating
them
illegal,
under
what
it
aptly
terms,
the
constitutional
rule
of
silverthorne
would
and
could
prohibit
the
government
from
using
this
illegally
obtained
material
against
these
petitioners
in
this
very
grand
jury
proceeding,
that
is
petitioners
could
hire
a
lawyer,
file
a
civil
suit
under
the
authority
of
go-bart
importing
company,
or
rio
against
united
states
or
the
bivens
case
decided
in
this
court,
short
time
ago
and
invoked
a
consistent
course
of
federal
decision
going
back
60
years
to
wise
versus
henkel,
in
220
u.s.
they
would
claim
that
the
inherent
power
of
the
federal
court
could
be
used
reaching
out
the
federal
equity
power
to
enjoin
the
government
for
making
use
of
this
material.
of
course,
as
this
court
has
heard
this
morning,
an
argument
in
tatum
case,
the
government
might
claim
in
such
a
civil
suit
that
the
case
was
not
right
for
an
injunction
to
issue,
that
is
if
the
petitioners
could
not,
before
they
have
received
the
subpoena,
demonstrate
the
kind
of
immediate
harm
that
the
federal
equity
power
has
customarily
used
to
protect
against.
but
petitioner’s
case,
if
the
court
please,
could
not
be
more
right,
and
that
is
why
it
is
incredible
to
us
that
the
government
won’t
go
the
last
six
inches
with
us,
since
they
have
agreed
on
just
about
everything
else
and
say
that
when
the
petitioners
are
standing
in
the
jail
house
door
that
surely
they
have
a
right
to
prevent
the
use
against
them
of
this
material.
they
are
not,
the
petitioners
are
not,
like
the
defendant
in
the
case
of
blue
against
united
states.
in
the
position
of
a
gratuitous
intervener
in
the
grand
jury,
who
merely
suspects
that
here
she
is
being
talked
about
in
the
secrecy
of
the
grand
jury
room
and
wants
to
stop
the
grand
jury’s
process.
no,
they
are
standing
in
the
jailhouse
door
because
the
material
the
government
admits
is
going
to
be
used
against
them
in
the
grand
jury
room.
so
this
case
is
no
different,
from
asking
a
district
court
to
sustain
any
other
claim
of
privilege,
any
other
claim
of
privacy
protecting
privilege
if
the
court
please,
at
the
behest
of
any
other
grand
jury
witness,
in
any
other
grand
jury,
in
any
federal
court
in
the
land.
in
this
connection,
we
ask
the
court
to
note,
as
i
mentioned
before
to
the
petitioners
are
after
all,
if
this
tap
is
illegal,
being
made
the
victim
of
a
federal
crime
and
they’re
in
the
grand
jury
room.
and
so
the
government
asks
this
court
to
break
the
promise
which
this
court
made,
in
the
alderman
case
in
two
ways.
first,
by
negating
what
alderman
termed
the
constitutional
rule
that
forbids
using
the
fruits
of
unlawful
tapping
against
persons
who,
like
the
petitioners
are
agreed
and
second,
they
want
to
undermine
alderman
by
urging
this
court
to
permit
the
government
to
commit
the
federal
crime
detailed
in
section
2511
and
in
this
court’s
words,
to
let
those
who
flop
the
rules
go
unscathed
and
to
cavalierly
disregard
the
rights
of
the
person
done
with
the
act.
so
this
court
can
decide
this
case
based
on
elementary
principles
of
equity
jurisprudence
with
some
attention
to
the
mandate
of
the
fourth
amendment
in
protecting
the
right
of
privacy,
and
some
attention
to
the
inherent
power
in
the
words
of
wise
versus
henkel
of
the
district
court
to
protect
against
abuse
of
its
process
by
its
officers.
the
constitution
surely
requires
no
less,
but
there
is,
as
two
courts
of
appeals,
one
of
them
en
bank
have
held
a
statutory
ground
of
decision,
which
is
available
to
the
court
in
this
case.
a
1968
act,
sections
2510
through
2520
of
title
18
provide
for
notice,
for
hearing,
and
for
suppression.
at
the
instance
of
those
who
like
petitioners,
are
about
to
be
harmed
by
surveillance
against
them.
section
2515
of
the
act
forbids
the
use
of
material
unlawfully
obtained
in
any
court
or
grand
jury
proceeding.
section
2518
of
the
act
in
subdivision
9,
requires
that
before
material
obtained
under
the
act
is
to
be
used
against
a
person,
there
must
be
ten
days
notice
given
to
that
person.
other
way
this
is
one
answer
to
the
government’s
contention
that
our
position
here
is
going
to
sabotage
grand
juries.
the
government
knew
it
was
going
to
use
the
fruits
of
this
tapping
against
mr.
gelbard
and
mr.
parnas.
if
they
had
sent
ten
days
before
that
grand
jury
appearance
a
letter
saying
we
intend
to
use
it,
mr.
gelbard
and
parnas
could
have
come
in
to
the
district
court,
asked
the
district
judge
to
look
at
the
order
authorizing
the
tap,
gotten
the
threshold
determination
of
legality
and
illegality.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
their
conversations
are
overheard,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
the
grand
jury
investigation
mr.
chief
justice
has,
does
far
resulted
in
several
indictments.
those
are
mostly
in
the
field
of
interstate
gambling.
one
of
the
people
that’s
been
indicted,
mr.
jerome
zarowitz,
was
formerly
executive
vice
president
of
a
hotel
called
caesars
palace
in
las
vegas.
mr.
parnas
is
an
accountant
who
works
in
new
york
for
caesars
palace,
so,
so
far
as
we
can
determine,
there
is
--
there
is
some
connection
between
what
the
grand
juries
indicted
about
and
what
they
want
to
ask
mr.
parnas
about.
with
respect
to
mr.
gelbard,
the
questions
asked
that
are
reproduced
in
the
appendix
focus
on
the
allegation
to
put
it
bluntly
that
he
was
the
bagman
carrying
the
proceeds
of
illegal
interstate
gaming
between
los
angeles
and
las
vegas.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
mr.
chief
justice,
with
respect
to
mr.
parnas,
the
government
informs
us
in
a
footnote
to
its
brief
that
it
intends
to
seek
immunity
grant
for
him
if
he
should
return
to
the
grand
jury,
and
the
government
represented
below
and
does
here
that
it
has
no
intention
at
this
time
of
prosecuting
mr.
gelbard
and
mr.
parnas.
so
i
think
that
--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
if
he
were
afraid
of
a
criminal
persecution,
yes
mr.
chief
justice,
he
could
invoke
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
well
here
he
is
protecting
another
right.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
mr.
chief
justice,
he
is
of
course
afraid
of
that,
as
are
all
citizens
faced
with
government
scrutiny
of
this
kind,
but
he
is
also
seeking,
in
this
case,
in
this
proceeding,
to
protect
another
right
of
his.
the
fourth
amendment,
mr.
chief
justice
is
not
designed
solely
to
protect
guilty
criminals
and
those
who
fear
the
government
is
going
to
prove
that
they
are
guilty
criminals,
and
mr.
parnas
and
mr.
gelbard
are
seeking
an
application
of
their
fourth
amendment
rights
in
the
context
of
this
proceeding,
which
will
vindicate
their
right
of
privacy,
a
right
which
is
available
to
them
whether
or
not
they
fear
prosecution
and
whether
or
not
they
are
granted
immunity
from
prosecution
by
the
government.
they
are
thus,
in
no
different
position
from
any
person,
who
invokes
a
privacy
protecting
privilege,
in
front
of
the
grand
jury,
regardless
of
whether
he
fears
prosecution
by
the
government.
perhaps
i
can
use
an
analogy
if
i
may.
let
us
assume,
that
the
fbi,
through
stealth,
listened
beyond
on
a
conversation
between
a
penitent
and
a
priest
engaged
in
the
ritual
of
the
confession
and
that
thereafter,
the
government
called
the
penitent
before
a
grand
jury
and
sought
to
interrogate
him
or
her
about
what
had
been
heard
in
the
confessional.
in
such
a
case,
if
the
government
indicated
any
intention
to
use
the
transcript
that
the
fbi
agents
over
hearing
to
refresh
the
penitent’s
recollection
about
what
she
or
he
had
told
the
priest.
a
fair
reading
of
the
clergyman
penitent
privilege,
at
least
at
it
appears
in
such
statements
as
that
in
the
proposed
federal
rules
of
evidence,
would
it
seems
to
me
permit
the
witness
to
interpose
this
privacy
protecting
privilege,
and
so
here,
where
the
intrusion
is
illegal,
under
the
1968
act,
and
the
government
admits
that
it
intends
to
use
it.
we
say
that
the
law,
the
right
of
privacy
protects,
and
of
course
we
supplement
that
by
saying
that
irrespective
of
any
fifth
amendment
problems,
the
statute
forbids
these
material
to
be
used
in
a
way
that
the
government
plans
to
use
it.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
no,
mr.
justice
marshall
that
is
not
our
position.
the
government
could
call
mr.
parnas
and
mr.
gelbard
and
interrogate
them
about
any
subject
under
the
sun,
provided
the
district
court
has
held
that
the
tap
was
legal.
second,
if
the
district
court
-–
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
if
it’s
illegal
--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
the
congress
has
recently
legislated
with
respect
to
this
question
and
purported
to
set
up
a
cut-off
date
with
respect
to
claims
of
illegality,
but
passing
that
statutory
provision,
the
government
would
be
obliged
in
such
a
case,
merely
to
purify
its
evidence
and
to
show
that
the
questions
it
wanted
to
ask
were
either
so
far
removed
from
the
initial
illegalities
so
as
in
the
words
of
wong
sun
to
dissipate
the
taint
or
again
in
the
words
of
wong
sun,
derive
from
an
independent
source,
and
of
course
the
rule
of
wong
sun
in
this
connection
is
subsequently
been
applied
i
believe
by
its
citation
in
the
alderman
situation,
so
the
government
is
not
foreclosed
whenever
calling
them,
it
just
can’t
violate
people’s
rights
without
paying
the
price,
which
is
that
it
cannot
use
the
fruits
of
its
illegality.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
no
more
than
the
illegality
is
worth,
mr.
justice
marshall,
which
is
to
say,
they
can’t
exploit
the
wrong
that
they’ve
done,
that
is
all
the
limitation
we
want
to
put
on
the
government
in
this
case.
now,
to
all
of
this,
the
government
replies
what?
that
the
rule
which
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court
and
plain
meaning
of
the
act
established,
would
impose
too
heavy
a
burden
on
the
administration
of
criminal
justice.
there
are
two
answers
to
this
contention,
first,
that
it
isn’t
true
and
second,
we
invite
to
court
to
think
of
the
alternative.
this
was
a
tap
under
the
provisions
of
the
1968
act.
the
1968
act,
if
the
district
judge
orders
it,
gives
persons
overheard
in
these
taps
the
right
to
be
notified
for
the
fact
they
have
been
overheard,
thus,
it
requires
the
government
to
keep
records.
government
says
in
its
brief
that
in
the
remand
in
the
alderman
case,
they
spent
20
man-days
searching
through
the
records
to
see
whether
or
not
the
petitioners
there
had
been
overheard.
i
can
understand
that,
this
court
knows
from
bitter
experience
how
difficult
it
was
to
ferried
out
taps
that
the
fbi
had
conducted
and
subsequently
attempted
to
hide
even
attorneys
in
the
justice
department.
but
under
the
1968
act,
all
of
that
is
supposed
to
be
over,
there
supposed
to
be
records
kept
and
so
the
note
is
giving
function
that
the
act
makes
a
crucial
part
of
its
protection,
of
the
rights
of
the
individual
can
be
adhered
to
and
complied
with.
there
is
finally,
or
second
rather,
the
gratuitous
assertion
that
these
petitioners
are
not
trying
to
protect
their
rights,
they
are
trying
to
shield
somebody
else
that
if
they’re
really
concerned
about
themselves,
they’d
invoke
the
fifth
amendment
like
good
citizens
and
not
worry
about
all
these
privacy
argument.
they
seek,
as
i
have
mentioned
before
to
protect
their
own
right
of
privacy
as
chief
judge
sobeloff
said,
in
the
case
of
lankford
versus
gelston,
upholding
the
use
of
the
federal
equity
powered
issue
and
injunction
against
illegal
search,
it
would
be
a
grotesque
irony
if
our
courts
protect
only
against
the
unlawful
search
which
uncovers
contraband,
by
the
exclusionary
rule,
while
offering
no
relief
against
an
admittedly
unlawful
pattern
and
practice,
affecting
hundreds
of
innocent
homeowners.
thus,
we
are
saying
here
that
the
privacy
protecting
job
of
protecting
federal
district
court
isn’t
limited
to
saying
that
contraband
seized
from
somebody
who
is
proven
guilty
by
the
fact
the
contraband
was
seized,
ought
not
to
be
received
in
evidence,
that
the
privacy
protecting
function
arises
anytime
a
citizen
is
about
to
be
the
victim
of
an
invasion
of
privacy
directed
against
him
or
her,
the
government
said
in
alderman
and
then
said
it
in
this
court
and
through
the
words
of
the
solicitor
general
that
it
was
concerned
about
people
like
petitioners,
third
parties
wander
in
the
taps,
that
have
been
authorized
against
somebody
else.
we
invite
the
government
in
this
case
to
share
that
concern
that
we
have
about
these
third
parties
under
these
circumstances.
these
are
not,
if
the
court
please,
the
times
of
the
assize
clarendon
in
which
grand
juror
sat
under
a
tree
and
gossiped
about
breaches
of
the
king’s
peace.
the
grand
jury
is
a
formidable
force,
with
the
power
to
call
on
many
investigative
agencies
to
pull
people
off
the
streets
and
compel
them
to
testify.
it
may
be
used
for
investigation
and
as
a
dress
rehearsal
for
the
government’s
case
in
chief
of
trial.
it
is
the
sole
inquisitorial
element,
in
an
accusatorial
system
of
jurisprudence.
there
must
be
limits
on
its
power.
yes,
those
limits
may
slow
down
the
process
some,
as
we
say
in
our
brief,
due
process
is
always
slower
than
summary
process
or
drumhead
process
or
pistol
at
the
head
process
or
as
in
this
case
no
process
at
all.
in
conclusion,
we
say
only
that
a
great
deal
has
been
written
and
more
said
about
the
way
of
recent
congressional
legislation
on
crime.
many
see
in
these
statutes
an
unyielding
hostility
to
civil
liberty,
but
however
these
laws
may
fair
here,
when
measured
against
the
constitution,
this
court
should
surely
set
its
phase
against
any
attempt,
as
in
this
case,
to
read
out
of
those
statutes
the
precious
few
concessions
to
personal
freedom,
which
they
indisputably
contain.
the
government’s
position
here,
if
the
court
please
is
sabotaged.
it
is
sabotaged
of
the
1968
act,
sabotaged
of
a
170
years
of
this
court’s
decision
and
sabotaged
of
the
rights
of
liberty
and
personal
security.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
just
a
few
words
in
rebuttal
if
may
about
the
proper
meaning
to
describe
to
this
statutory
terms
to
which
mr.
friedman
referred.
the
government’s
positions
seems
to
be
that
only
if
the
legislative
history
is
ambiguous
need
we
read
the
statute
here.
i
invite
the
court’s
attention
first
to
section
2515
of
the
statute
which
is
at
page
8
of
the
appendix
of
our
brief.
that
section
forbids
receipt
in
evidence
in
any
trial,
hearing
or
other
proceeding
in
or
before
any
grand
jury.
a
certain
evidence
if
disclosure
would
be
in
violation
of
this
chapter
apart
of
the
this
chapter
to
which
that
statute
refers
is
surely
section
2511
which
makes
it
a
criminal
offense
to
disclose
information
obtained
in
violation
of
the
crime
control
and
safe
streets
act.
particularly,
section
2511
subdivision
1
(c)
reprinted
at
page
5
of
the
appendix
of
our
brief.
so
there
is
in
2515
not
just
a
right
but
a
remedy.
now,
the
legislative
history
if
the
court
please,
does
say
that
section
2518
subdivision
10
of
the
statute
which
has
to
do
with
notice
and
hearing
is
not
intended
to
apply
to
a
grand
jury
proceeding
and
it
cites
the
case
of
blue
versus
united
states.
we
do
not
contest
the
holding
in
blue
in
this
proceeding.
we
are
not
saying
that
a
person
indicted
has
the
right
to
challenge
the
legality
of
the
evidence
the
grand
jury
heard
and
we
are
not
saying
in
this
case
that
a
person
who
suspects
that
she
or
he
is
being
investigated
by
the
grand
jury.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
pardon?
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
i
think
mr.
justice
white
that
the
preponderant
rule
in
the
circuits
these
days
undercuts
the
broad
language
of
the
costello
case,
yes
sir.
i
think
that
when
this
court
next
gets
the
issue
that
there
would
be
a
good
argument
made
that
you
can
--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
i
think
so
mr.
justice
white
in
this
kind
of
a
case.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
if
i
am
wrong
on
that
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
we
--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
no,
we’re
not
wrong
on
this
case
because
--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
it
is
not
a
tough
line
mr.
justice
white
because
the
person
who
is
indicted
that
is
whose
made
the
defendant
who
is
never
been
called
before
the
grand
jury
has
available
of
motion
to
suppress
in
the
criminal
case
which
if
the
grand
jury
indictment
is
based
solely
on
wiretap
evidence
he
is
going
to
win
anyway
because
the
evidence
of
the
government
has
a
trial
in
all
the
evidence.
they
have
a
trial
it’s
going
to
be
suppressed.
that’s
typical
in
these
gambling
cases
where
the
government’
whole
case
is
jerry
and
nickel
on
the
bares
on
sunday,
right?
right
and
that
is
the
interstate
telephone
conversation.
it’s
a
bet.
it’s
a
violation
of
the
anti-racketeering
legislation.
that’s
the
government
whole
case;
if
that
tap
is
illegal
the
government
case
founders
the
motion
to
suppress.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
it
is
the
way
it
happens
and
that’s
why
there
are
cases
in
the
ninth
and
seventh
circuits
dismissing
indictment
because
the
evidence
before
the
grand
jury
was
illegal.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
it
doesn’t.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
it
doesn’t
necessary
follow
in
every
case.
no.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
in
that
case,
the
motion
to
suppress
in
the
criminal
case
still
gives
the
criminal
defendant
a
protection
against
the
material
being
used
against
him
or
her.
the
only
person
left
unprotected
then
in
the
government
scheme
of
things
would
be
the
grand
jury
witness
where
the
government
finds
out
about
because
of
an
illegal
bug
gets
hold
off
the
streets
and
he
is
told,
you
better
answer
these
questions
we’re
making
up.
you
better
help
in
a
disclosure
of
this
illegally
overheard
material
otherwise
you
are
going
to
go
to
jail
for
the
life
of
the
grand
jury.
that
is
my
conclusion
--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
or
one
might
be
--
one
might
be
indicted
oneself,
yes
mr.
justice
white.[audience
laughing]
the
government’s
position,
also
if
the
court
please,
is
anomalous
because
of
the
citation
of
section
2520.
the
government
says
presumably
that
mr.
parnas
and
mr.
gelbard
could
get
a
judgment
in
the
civil
case
that
they
been
illegally
overheard
that
would
be
raised
adjudicata
and
then
when
they
came
before
the
grand
jury,
i
guess
the
government
could
not
use
this
illegally
overheard
material.
but
what’s
the
difference
here?
the
only
difference
is
the
case
is
right
pertinent
would
be
if
they
came
in
and
brought
a
strike
civil
action
without
there
never
having
gotten
the
subpoena
to
appear
before
the
grand
jury.
it
is
right
because
they
are
about
to
go
jail.
this
conclusion,
mr.
justice
white
and
if
the
court
please
that
we’ve
come
to
rests
not
just
on
silverthorne
which
is
a
little
different
from
this
case
but
on
wise
versus
henkel
in
220
u.s.
and
there
this
court
said
no
uncertain
terms
that
the
district
judge
has
the
power
to
control
the
illegal
conduct
of
its
officers
and
the
execution
of
its
process.
the
rule
of
wise
versus
henkel
has
not
been
disturbed
by
any
subsequent
decision
and
nothing
in
this
statute
or
in
the
legislative
history
evinces
any
congressional
intention
to
disturb
it
in
cases
arising
under
the
1968
act.
and
so
mr.
parnas
and
mr.
gelbard
are
in
no
different
a
position
before
the
grand
jury
than
any
other
witness
who
resists
the
compulsion
to
testify
by
invoking
some
privilege
designed
to
protect
not
against
the
incrimination
but
privacy.
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
that
have
been
proposed
to
follow
such
privileges,
trade
secrets,
political
vote,
priest
penitent,
lawyer
client
and
there
are
common
law
ones
such
as
the
version
of
the
marital
privilege
mention
in
the
dissent
in
and
the
wyatt
case
and
the
diplomatic
privilege.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
if
“a”
is
a
government
agent.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
then
aside
from
his
remedy
in
the
canon
law
courts
[laughter]
which
he
would
have,
a
civil
remedy
that
“b”
would
have
would
be
against
“a”
and
since
there’s
no
state
action
involved
at
the
point
of
the
beating
there
isn’t
at
that
point
anything
that
the
law
can
take
notice
of.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
if
it’s
a
state
officer
that
beat
up
“b”
to
tell
a
story
about
“c”
then
judge
learned
hand’s
opinion
in
inri
freed
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
indicates
that
in
such
a
situation
of
federal
court
has
under
its
plenary
equity
powers
the
right
and
some
would
say
that
duty
under
appropriate
circumstances
to
intervene
to
protect
against
the
consequences.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
how?
if
“b”
had
already
testified
by
suppressing
the
use
of
that
evidence
against
“c”
if
he’d
not
by
giving
him
the
right
not
--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
he
could
bring
a
suit
citing
inri
freed
as
authority
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
well
he
could
refuse
to
testify
and
ask
that
the
court
uphold
his
claim
as
sufficient,
excuse
me,
as
the
petitioners
did
here.
thank
you.
