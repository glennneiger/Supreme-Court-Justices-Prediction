mr.
jack
j.
levine
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
let
me
say
a
word
or
two
about
the
question
that’s
come
up
with
regard
to
the
procedural
posture
that
this
case
is
in
now.
the
position
that
the
government
took
in
the
trial
court
was
that
they
would
refuse
to
affirm
or
deny
the
existence
of
the
surveillance
not
because
they
didn’t
know,
but
because
the
witness
had
no
such
right.
and
indeed
in
the
court
of
appeals,
government
counsel
was
asked
by
chief
judge
hasty,
“do
you
want
to
take
a
position
on
that
or
words
to
that
effect”
and
the
government
counsel
as
i
recall
responded,
“no,
our
position
is
that
it's
irrelevant
because
the
witness
doesn’t
have
the
right
to
raise
the
issue.”
there
was
no
denial
in
this
case
until
the
government
filed
its
petition
for
certiorari.
in
any
allegations
with
regard
to
the
existence
or
non-existence
of
surveillance
in
this
case
is
outside
of
the
record.
i
might
also
say
in
that
regard
that
in
as
much
as
the
government
refuses
to
affirm
or
deny
surveillance
in
the
district
court,
they
also
refuse
to
say
whether
or
not
a
court
order
or
a
national
security
tap
was
involved.
so
that
to
the
extent
that
the
government
argues
that
it
may
not
be
a
violation
of
the
criminal
section
of
the
statute,
if
there
is
such
a
specification,
their
representation
i
would
submit
is
likewise
irrelevant.
in
the
posture
that
this
case
was
decided
in
the
district
court
and
on
appeal,
the
government
refused
to
say
anything.
and
on
that
basis,
the
court
assumed
that
there
may
have
been
surveillance
and
that
more
important
decided
that
the
witness
had
a
right
to
raise
the
issue
and
had
the
right
to
get
a
reply
from
the
government.
now,
if
we
read
the
government’s
brief
in
the
egan
case,
and
indeed
in
the
early
portion
of
government’s
counsel
argument,
there
is
an
awful
lot
of
discussion
of
the
exclusionary
rule.
and
i
think
it's
most
important
to
analyze
why
it
is
that
the
government
relies
so
heavily
upon
what
they
call
the
exclusionary
rule
and
past
cases
dealing
with
the
use
of
testimony
in
subsequent
proceedings.
their
argument
and
their
use
of
the
exclusionary
rule
is
based
upon
a
critical
premise
which
we
submit
is
false.
and
that
premise
is
that
sister
egan
in
the
trial
court
sought
to
invoke
the
exclusionary
remedy
in
order
to
remedy
a
past
and
prior
violation
of
her
statutory
rights
independent
of
what
was
happening
in
the
grand
jury.
and
i
would
submit
to
this
court
that
that
premise
is
false.
and
that
really
what
we
were
involved
with
here
is
a
question
of
whether
or
not
it
violates
the
law
to
compel
within
the
grand
jury
room
both
statute
and
constitutional,
within
the
grand
jury
room
divulgence
and
disclosure
of
illegally
ascertained
conversations.
and
when
the
court
asked
the
question,
“well,
what’s
the
harm
to
the
witness
if
the
evidence
isn’t
being
used
against
him
or
her,”
the
answer
is
that
the
harm
to
the
witness
comes
from
the
divulgence
and
the
disclosure,
which
is
prohibited
by
the
statute
and
as
you
look
at
section
20
--
mr.
jack
j.
levine
well,
that
would
be
used
--
i
would
submit
that
that
would
be
used
under
--
i
forget,
c
is
used
and
i
think
subsection
d
is
disclosure
on
(voice
overlap).
mr.
jack
j.
levine
well,
we
never
found
out
because
there
was
(voice
overlap).
mr.
jack
j.
levine
questions
as
to
the
purport
and
meaning
of
the
conversation,
what
was
said
and
questions
of
that
kind
and
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
in
that
context
that
the
statutory
definition
of
the
contents
of
a
communication
includes
not
only
the
actual
words
spoken,
but
the
purport
and
content
of
the
message.
and
so
as
we
look
at
2511
c
and
d,
we
find
that
not
only
has
the
actual
interception
been
deemed
an
invasion
of
rights
of
privacy,
but
the
use
and
the
disclosure
as
well
had
been
made
a
statutory
crime.
and
in
addition
to
2511
c
and
d,
we
have
2515
which
has
already
been
referred
to
in
the
previous
arguments.
2515
is
an
absolute
prohibition
against
the
use
or
introduction
in
a
grand
jury
of
evidence
obtained
in
violation
of
any
provision
of
the
chapter.
and
i
might
mention
in
that
context
your
honors
that
2517,
subsection
3
specifically
says
that
there
can
be
no
testimony
in
a
grand
jury
as
to
illegally
--
as
to
electronic
surveillance
evidence
unless
that
evidence
was
obtained
by
means
authorized
by
the
chapter.
so
not
only
do
we
have
the
criminal
sanction
in
2515,
we
have
another
separate
section
which
talks
about
use
of
evidence
in
a
grand
jury
on
the
condition
that
it's
obtained
by
means
authorized
under
the
statute.
now,
the
government
has
suggested
that
notwithstanding
the
broad
language
of
2515
and
the
existence
of
the
criminal
sections
and
so
on,
that
there
are
some
limitation
imposed
by
the
motion
to
suppress
section
which
is
2518
subsection
10
a.
the
first
requirement
of
2518
(10)
(a)
is
that
sister
egan
being
aggrieved
person
and
an
aggrieved
person
is
statutorily
defined
as
a
person
whose
own
conversations
were
intercepted,
whose
own
wire
or
all
communication
were
overheard.
there
is
no
requirement
that
such
a
person
be
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
proceeding
and
indeed,
congress
expressly
rejected
that
condition
in
the
statute.
in
1967,
senator
mcclellan
introduced
the
bill
into
the
senate,
which
defined
aggrieved
party
as
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
proceeding.
now
that
bill
wasn’t
passed
and
in
1968,
senator
hruska
introduced
a
subsequent
bill
which
changed
that
language
and
defined
aggrieved
person
as
a
party
to
a
communication.
and
the
legislative
history
isn't
cited
in
the
brief,
but
a
section
by
section
comparison
of
these
two
provisions
can
be
found
in
the
congressional
record
at
volume
114,
part
10,
90th
congress
2nd
session,
page
13211.
now,
in
addition
to
the
aggrieved
party
terminology
in
the
--
aggrieved
person
terminology
in
the
section,
which
sister
egan
clearly
is,
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
a
grand
jury
inquiry
constitutes
a
proceeding
as
that
word
is
used
in
a
statute
and
indeed
hale
versus
henkel
which
was
mentioned
earlier
by
mr.
justice
douglas
is
most
opposite
in
that
regard
as
our
cases
like
capaldi
(ph)
versus
the
united
states
or
other
cases,
which
arise
in
the
context
of
contempt
hearings
held
to
adjudicate
issues
that
arise
in
the
grand
jury.
and
in
addition
to
the
meaning
of
the
word
proceeding,
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
a
proceeding
on
an
order
compelling
testimony
initiated
by
the
government
is
also
a
proceeding
before
a
court
under
authority
of
the
united
states
which
is
the
language
in
2518
(10)
(a)
and
in
an
application
on
a
government
--
a
hearing
on
a
government
application
for
a
contempt
would
likewise
be
covered
by
the
statute.
and
indeed,
judge
gibbons'
dissent
in
the
egan
case
in
the
third
circuit
concedes
this
point.
it
concedes
that
notwithstanding
any
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
a
grand
jury
is
covered
certainly
in
a
contempt
application
or
hearing
in
an
order
to
compel
testimony
would
be
covered
by
the
statute
and
i
believe
he
refers
to
that
as
a
non-issue.
now,
the
government
draws
--
tries
to
draw
support
from
the
omission
of
the
term
grand
jury
in
2518
(10)
(a)
and
it
parallels
that
omission
with
the
omission
of
legislative
committees
and
it
says
that
those
two
omissions
indicate
an
intent
on
the
part
of
congress
not
to
make
the
2515
remedy
available
to
witnesses
before
such
bodies.
now,
to
reference
the
omission
to
legislative
committees
is
really
very
interesting
because
the
analysis,
let
me
step
back
for
a
second.
as
we’ve
analyzed
2518
(10)
(a),
we’ve
drawn
a
distinction
between
the
situation
of
an
actual
witness
as
opposed
to
someone
who
isn’t
subpoenaed,
and
therefore,
not
in
the
grand
jury
or
not
brought
before
the
court,
a
distinction
between
parties
and
non-parties
and
there’s
a
very
curious
sense
in
the
legislative
history
of
2518
(10)
(a)
from
which
we
draw
support
for
our
position
on
the
distinction.
the
sense
and
i
believe
it
may
have
been
referred
to
by
government
counsel
in
explaining
the
omission
of
legislative
committees
says,
“nor
was
this
provision
intended
to
grant
to
the
federal
courts'
jurisdiction
over
the
congress
itself.”
and
the
case
cited
is
hearst
versus
black.
now,
i’ll
come
to
hearst
versus
black
in
a
sense,
but
there's
something
very
curious
about
the
sense
from
the
legislative
history
that
i
just
spoke
off.
not
only
does
it
appear
to
contradict
the
inclusion
of
legislative
committees
in
2515,
it
also
appears
to
conflict
with
the
line
of
cases
in
this
court,
most
notably,
watkins
versus
the
united
states,
which
do
hold
that
the
federal
courts
do
have
the
power
and
indeed
the
duty
to
review
the
propriety
of
congressional
action
if
and
when
a
legislative
witness
is
brought
to
a
contempt
proceeding.
and
then
we
turn
to
hearst
versus
black
which
is
cited
in
the
government’s
brief.
hearst
versus
black
was
a
case
in
which
a
senate
subcommittees
subpoenaed
telegraph
records
from
the
telegraph
company
and
not
from
hearst.
presumably,
those
records
related
to
hearst
and
he
saw
it
to
intervene
to
prevent
the
committees’
use
of
those
documents
in
its
proceeding.
and
what
the
court
said
was
that
in
as
much
as
mr.
hearst
hadn’t
been
subpoenaed,
wasn’t
before
the
committee,
hadn’t
been
ordered
to
testify,
he
couldn’t
intervene
and
simply
stopped
the
proceedings.
and
most
significant,
the
case
went
on
to
say
that
if
hearst
had
been
before
the
committee
as
a
subpoenaed
witness,
he
would
have
the
right
to
litigate
the
lawfulness
of
the
committee's
action.
and
that’s
precisely
what
we’re
talking
about
in
our
analysis
of
2518
(10)
(a)
when
we
say
there's
a
world
of
difference
and
it's
not
too
hard
to
ascertain
and
answer
to
the
question
that
mr.
justice
white
i
think
asked
earlier
between
someone
who
subpoenaed,
and
therefore,
before
the
court
to
compel
testimony
or
any
contempt
hearing
and
someone
who
isn’t
subpoenaed.
there’s
a
difference
between
sister
egan
whose
called
in
and
compelled
to
divulge
and
disclose
her
own
conversations
as
opposed
to
a
third
party
agent
or
somebody
else
who
comes
in
and
testifies
without
her
knowledge.
now,
she
may
not
be
able
to
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
it
would
be
still
be
a
crime
if
the
agent
did
it,
she
may
not
be
able
to
stop
that.
and
such
a
holding
would
be
consistent
with
cases
like
hearst
and
blue
versus
united
states
which
i
will
come
to
in
a
moment.
there's
a
very
important
distinction
between
someone
who
is
subpoenaed
and
is
compelled
to
testify
and
someone
whose
own
rights
of
privacy
may
have
been
invaded,
but
not
by
the
actions
of
the
prosecutor
or
the
grand
jury
or
the
court.
now,
the
subject
or
18
u.s.c.
3504
has
come
up
and
i
think
that
that
section
is
absolutely
crucial.
the
government
has
said
that
what
could
be
more
anomalous
than
congress
using
in
3504
widening
the
rights
that
hadn’t
been
made
available
in
title
iii
which
was
passed
in
1968
because
the
government’s
position
is
that
title
iii
didn’t
give
the
witness
any
rights.
well,
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
it
would’ve
been
very
anomalous
if
3504
had
changed
title
iii
and
that
in
fact
it
did
didn’t
change
title
iii
and
that
moreover,
the
inclusion
of
grand
juries
in
3504
was
an
express
adoption
of
the
provisions
of
title
iii
which
had
been
enacted
two
years
earlier
and
moreover
in
that
context,
the
government’s
position
that
since
a
witness
isn’t
a
party
as
such
to
a
grand
jury
proceeding,
he
or
she
doesn’t
have
any
rights
to
object
to
surveillance,
that
position
makes
the
plain
language
of
3504
nonsensible
because
not
only
does
3504
include
the
term
grand
jury,
it
also
talks
about
aggrieved
parties
and
clearly,
what
that
section
would
envision
(voice
overlap).
mr.
jack
j.
levine
i
am
sorry.
mr.
jack
j.
levine
who
were
the
parties?
mr.
jack
j.
levine
well,
the
witnesses
in
the
proceeding.
mr.
jack
j.
levine
well,
i
would
suggest
sir
that
you
become
party
to
a
judicial
proceeding
if
and
when
the
government
seeks
affirmatively
to
bring
you
in
before
a
judge
and
seek
to
use
the
power
of
the
court
to
compel
your
testimony.
mr.
jack
j.
levine
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
j.
levine
no
sir,
i
understood
mr.
justice
marshall’s
question
to
be
who
would
be
a
party
to
a
grand
jury
proceeding.
am
i
not
correct?
mr.
jack
j.
levine
no
your
honor,
i
wasn’t
talking
about
(voice
overlap).
mr.
jack
j.
levine
no,
i
was
talking
about
the
significance
of
being
involuntarily
made
a
party
to
a
court
proceeding
in
which
the
evidence
is
sought
to
be
compelled
from
you
and
then
further
being
made
a
party
to
a
contempt
proceeding
and
what
our
position
is
and
indeed
there
was
no
pre-testimony
motion
to
suppress
file
in
this
case
is
that
if
and
when
the
government
seeks
affirmatively
to
invoke
the
power
of
the
court,
the
court
is
duty
bound
not
to
compel
testimony
to
compel
divulgence
and
disclosure
in
express
violation
in
expressed
violation
of
2511
(c)
and
(d)
unless
and
until
there
has
been
a
determination
that
the
surveillance
was
lawful.
mr.
jack
j.
levine
your
honor,
there
are
--
you're
talking
about
post
indictment?
mr.
jack
j.
levine
i
would
say
--
mr.
jack
j.
levine
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
j.
levine
well,
the
defendant
can't
challenge
it
because
he
hasn’t
been
indicted
yet
presumably
and
once
he
is
indicted
and
you
present
with
a
blue
kind
of
situation,
then
he’s
got
adequate
pretrial,
trial
and
post
trial
motions
that
he
can
use.
mr.
jack
j.
levine
so
far
as
i
know,
there
aren’t
any
constitutional
cases
on
that.
there
is
--
i
can
refer
the
court
to
(voice
overlap).
mr.
jack
j.
levine
right
and
i
would
suggest
that
also
in
that
sense,
in
other
words
because
it
talks
about
defending
with
(voice
overlap).
mr.
jack
j.
levine
yes
sir
and
certainly
a
witness
would
have
that
--
would
be
one
(voice
overlap).
mr.
jack
j.
levine
yes
sir,
i
would
say
that
is
true.
mr.
jack
j.
levine
well,
(voice
overlap).
mr.
jack
j.
levine
it's
clearly
the
witness.
mr.
jack
j.
levine
i
can't
think
of
anybody
else,
no.
quite
frankly
i
haven’t
given
it
much
thought.
i
mean,
it
appears
to
me
that
the
whole
(voice
overlap).
mr.
jack
j.
levine
yes
sir,
but
as
far
as
i
can
conceive,
a
witness
is
clearly
involved
in
a
grand
jury
proceeding
if
and
when
he
or
she
is
brought
to
a
contempt
or
proceeding
or
a
proceeding
at
an
order
to
compel
grand
jury
testimony,
the
witness
would
have
a
right
to
have
an
affirmance
or
a
denial
of
surveillance.
mr.
jack
j.
levine
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
j.
levine
yes
sir,
it
is.
mr.
jack
j.
levine
your
honor,
the
only
way
i
can
account
for
is
by
this
distinction
that
i've
drawn
between
parties
and
non-parties.
mr.
jack
j.
levine
well
yes
sir
it
would.
take
a
situation
where
there’s
been
some
illegal--
there's
been
an
invasion
of
privacy
under
the
statute
and
the
person
whose
own
privacy
was
invaded
was
not
subpoenaed
before
the
grand
jury,
but
some
third
part
was
called
as
a
witness
to
introduce
the
tapes
or
whatever.
now,
that
would
be
a
situation
in
which
the
person
whose
rights
were
invaded
would
not
be
under
2518
(10)
(a),
would
not
be
able
to
keep
that
evidence
out
of
the
grand
jury
because
he
or
she
wasn't
an
actually
before
it.
now,
that’s
the
kind
of
example
i
could
think
off
of
a
situation
where
rights
could
be
deemed
violated
under
--
in
a
grand
jury,
but
it
would
make
sense
to
exclude
--
well,
i
am
not
being
--
what
i’m
basically
saying
is
that
there
are
some
situations
where
you
would
have
an
invasion
of
rights
in
the
grand
jury,
but
there
wouldn’t
be
an
appropriate
forum
in
which
the
person
whose
rights
were
invaded
would
be
able
to
litigate
the
issue.
and
traditionally,
the
way
these
cases
have
come
up
is
that
you
don’t
get
a
decision
from
the
foreman
of
the
grand
jury
or
whoever
as
to
whether
or
not
your
rights
are
being
violated.
you
refuse
to
testify
for
one
reason
or
another
and
then
you
brought
before
the
court
and
our
position
is
that
anybody
whose
put
in
that
position
does
have
standing
under
the
statute.
mr.
jack
j.
levine
well
i
think
its
sufficient
either
way
and
i
think
that
(voice
overlap).
mr.
jack
j.
levine
well,
for
the
same
reason
that
they
included
legislative
committee
in
one
section
and
not
in
another.
there
maybe
situations
where
your
rights
are
being
violated
there,
but
in
as
much
you're
not
a
party,
there's
nothing
you
can
do
about
it.
in
that
context,
you
maybe
able
to
file
a
civil
suit
or
something
like
that.
that’s
the
only
way
i
can
account
for
the
omission
and
i
think
that
for
present
purposes
and
in
the
way
in
which
this
case
arose,
the
issue
may
not
be
crucial
because
there
wasn’t
any
motion
to
suppress
for
a
pre-testimony.
the
issue
arouse
at
the
--
there
was
a
refusal
to
answer
and
then
the
witness
sister
egan
was
brought
to
the
hearing
on
the
application
to
compel
testimony
and
then
the
contempt
proceeding.
now
really,
i
think
that
it’s
important
to
understand
that
what
the
government
is
saying
in
this
case
is
that
not
withstanding
2511
(c)
and
(d)
and
not
withstanding
2515,
and
not
withstanding
3504,
that
these
statutes
just
don’t
apply
because
grand
jury
doesn’t
mean
grand
jury.
it
means
something
else
and
to
divulge
or
disclose
doesn’t
mean
that,
it
means
something
else.
and
not
only
are
they
urging
that
position
for
the
proposition
that
the
witness
doesn't
have
standing,
they're
saying
in
addition
that
when
the
witness
is
brought
before
the
court,
the
court’s
got
no
power
to
do
anything
about
it
and
in
fact,
it
has
to
compel
without
choice,
the
commission
of
a
statutory
crime
and
through
the
express
provisions
of
2511.
and
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
that
that’s
an
unacceptable
interpretation
both
of
the
statute
and
apart
from
the
statute,
under
the
supervisory
power
of
this
court.
and
i
would
suggest
the
case
like
elkins
versus
united
states
where
you’ve
got
the
imperative
of
judicial
integrity
involved
and
indeed
the
express
legislative
finding
in
title
iii,
in
section
801
(b)
as
enacted
was
the
need
to
protect
the
integrity
of
court
and
administrative
proceedings.
and
i
suggest
to
this
court
that
judge
ryde
was
correct
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
dc
circuit
when
he
said
that
to
hold
otherwise
would
be
the
stand
our
whole
system
of
criminal
justice
on
its
head.
mr.
jack
j.
levine
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
j.
levine
the
denial
by
way
of
affidavit
in
the
absence
of
any
evidence
to
the
contrary
has
been
accepted
by
every
court
that’s
had
this
question
before
it.
it
has
happened
in
the
third
circuit
since
egan
came
down.
it
has
happened
in
the
(voice

mr.
jack
j.
levine
in
the
absence
--
i
would
say
that
that’s
probably
what
would
happen.
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
j.
levine
i
think
that’s
right,
yes.
i
don’t
think
there's
any
question
about
it
and
indeed
the
other
case
(voice

mr.
jack
j.
levine
well,
all
i
can
say
is
that
so
far
as
sister
egan
is
concerned,
had
they
done
that
there,
this
case
wouldn’t
be
here,
and
she
would
have
either
testified
or
or
in
jail,
but
in
the
process
(voice
overlap).
mr.
jack
j.
levine
i’m
sorry
your
honor,
i
didn’t
follow
that.
mr.
jack
j.
levine
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
j.
levine
yes
sir,
and
that’s
what's
happening
every
[voice
overlap].
mr.
jack
j.
levine
well
yes
sir
and
[voice
overlap].
mr.
jack
j.
levine
yes
sir
and
that’s
what's
happened
in
the
mark’s
case
in
the
first
circuit
and
then
in
the
other
cases
that
have
come
up.
in
other
words,
the
government
took
the
position
that
she
doesn’t
have
a
right
to
know
either
way.
and
she
said
that
she
did
and
that’s
how
the
case
came
up
on
appeal.
now,
since
then,
the
government
has
taken
a
different
position
in
a
number
of
cases
and
have
filed
wire
tap
disclaimers.
they’ve
done
it
in
the
third
circuit,
the
first
circuit,
the
sixth
circuit
i
believe
or
the
seventh
circuit
and
indeed,
they’ve
done
it
in
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
russo
case
--
mr.
jack
j.
levine
you
mean
with
that
[voice
overlap].
mr.
jack
j.
levine
well
she
--
i’m
not
sure
i’m
not
sure
i
follow
this,
but
i
--
what
i’m
trying
to
say
is
that
if
in
fact
there
is
a
remand,
it
has
to
be
for
the
purpose
i
would
say
of
the
government
filing
its
affidavit,
having
her
brought
before
the
court
and
say,
“okay,
the
issue
is
settled
now.
now,
will
you
or
will
you
not
testify?”
mr.
jack
j.
levine
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
j.
levine
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
j.
levine
no,
i
don’t
see
how
you
--
it
seems
to
me
that
--
well,
quite
frankly,
i
hadn’t
--
i
actually
hadn’t
thought
about
this,
to
be
perfectly
honest
with
you.
the
case
is
going
to
be
decided.
if
in
fact
it's
decided
adversely
to
us,
that’s
it.
if
it's
decided
favorably
to
us,
then
there'll
be
a
remand
anyway
for
the
same
purpose
that
you
just
suggested
that
the
government
should
put
the
affidavit.
mr.
jack
j.
levine
well
not
on
the
record
before
the
court.
mr.
jack
j.
levine
well,
first
of
all,
the
solicitor
general
is
not
the
person
that
(voice
overlap)
mr.
jack
j.
levine
yes
sir.
well,
if
in
fact
that’s
the
case
then
i
would
say
that
there's
no
difference,
but
there
definitely
has
to
be
--
dis-affirmation
has
to
be
in
the
record.
mr.
jack
j.
levine
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
j.
levine
yes
sir,
the
issue
[voice

mr.
jack
j.
levine
well,
regardless
of
what
happens
one
way
or
another,
the
issue
is
going
to
be
decided.
mr.
jack
j.
levine
it's
decided
adversely
to
us
--
mr.
jack
j.
levine
that’s
what
i
was
(voice
overlap)
mr.
jack
j.
levine
i’m
sorry,
i
thought
what
i
was
saying
before
was
that
she
can't
be
held
if
in
fact
there
is
a
denial
in
the
record,
she
can't
be
held
in
contempt
until
when
confirmed
with
that
she
says,
“right,
okay.”[voice
overlap].
mr.
jack
j.
levine
that’s
right.
yes
sir.
i’m
sorry
and
when
i
say
that’s
what
happened
in
the
mark’s
case,
that’s
exactly
what
happened
in
the
mark’s
case.
mr.
jack
j.
levine
thank
you
sir.
mr.
jack
j.
levine
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
let
me
say
a
word
or
two
about
the
question
that’s
come
up
with
regard
to
the
procedural
posture
that
this
case
is
in
now.
the
position
that
the
government
took
in
the
trial
court
was
that
they
would
refuse
to
affirm
or
deny
the
existence
of
the
surveillance
not
because
they
didn’t
know,
but
because
the
witness
had
no
such
right.
and
indeed
in
the
court
of
appeals,
government
counsel
was
asked
by
chief
judge
hasty,
“do
you
want
to
take
a
position
on
that
or
words
to
that
effect”
and
the
government
counsel
as
i
recall
responded,
“no,
our
position
is
that
it's
irrelevant
because
the
witness
doesn’t
have
the
right
to
raise
the
issue.”
there
was
no
denial
in
this
case
until
the
government
filed
its
petition
for
certiorari.
in
any
allegations
with
regard
to
the
existence
or
non-existence
of
surveillance
in
this
case
is
outside
of
the
record.
i
might
also
say
in
that
regard
that
in
as
much
as
the
government
refuses
to
affirm
or
deny
surveillance
in
the
district
court,
they
also
refuse
to
say
whether
or
not
a
court
order
or
a
national
security
tap
was
involved.
so
that
to
the
extent
that
the
government
argues
that
it
may
not
be
a
violation
of
the
criminal
section
of
the
statute,
if
there
is
such
a
specification,
their
representation
i
would
submit
is
likewise
irrelevant.
in
the
posture
that
this
case
was
decided
in
the
district
court
and
on
appeal,
the
government
refused
to
say
anything.
and
on
that
basis,
the
court
assumed
that
there
may
have
been
surveillance
and
that
more
important
decided
that
the
witness
had
a
right
to
raise
the
issue
and
had
the
right
to
get
a
reply
from
the
government.
now,
if
we
read
the
government’s
brief
in
the
egan
case,
and
indeed
in
the
early
portion
of
government’s
counsel
argument,
there
is
an
awful
lot
of
discussion
of
the
exclusionary
rule.
and
i
think
it's
most
important
to
analyze
why
it
is
that
the
government
relies
so
heavily
upon
what
they
call
the
exclusionary
rule
and
past
cases
dealing
with
the
use
of
testimony
in
subsequent
proceedings.
their
argument
and
their
use
of
the
exclusionary
rule
is
based
upon
a
critical
premise
which
we
submit
is
false.
and
that
premise
is
that
sister
egan
in
the
trial
court
sought
to
invoke
the
exclusionary
remedy
in
order
to
remedy
a
past
and
prior
violation
of
her
statutory
rights
independent
of
what
was
happening
in
the
grand
jury.
and
i
would
submit
to
this
court
that
that
premise
is
false.
and
that
really
what
we
were
involved
with
here
is
a
question
of
whether
or
not
it
violates
the
law
to
compel
within
the
grand
jury
room
both
statute
and
constitutional,
within
the
grand
jury
room
divulgence
and
disclosure
of
illegally
ascertained
conversations.
and
when
the
court
asked
the
question,
“well,
what’s
the
harm
to
the
witness
if
the
evidence
isn’t
being
used
against
him
or
her,”
the
answer
is
that
the
harm
to
the
witness
comes
from
the
divulgence
and
the
disclosure,
which
is
prohibited
by
the
statute
and
as
you
look
at
section
20
--
mr.
jack
j.
levine
well,
that
would
be
used
--
i
would
submit
that
that
would
be
used
under
--
i
forget,
c
is
used
and
i
think
subsection
d
is
disclosure
on
(voice
overlap).
mr.
jack
j.
levine
well,
we
never
found
out
because
there
was
(voice
overlap).
mr.
jack
j.
levine
questions
as
to
the
purport
and
meaning
of
the
conversation,
what
was
said
and
questions
of
that
kind
and
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
in
that
context
that
the
statutory
definition
of
the
contents
of
a
communication
includes
not
only
the
actual
words
spoken,
but
the
purport
and
content
of
the
message.
and
so
as
we
look
at
2511
c
and
d,
we
find
that
not
only
has
the
actual
interception
been
deemed
an
invasion
of
rights
of
privacy,
but
the
use
and
the
disclosure
as
well
had
been
made
a
statutory
crime.
and
in
addition
to
2511
c
and
d,
we
have
2515
which
has
already
been
referred
to
in
the
previous
arguments.
2515
is
an
absolute
prohibition
against
the
use
or
introduction
in
a
grand
jury
of
evidence
obtained
in
violation
of
any
provision
of
the
chapter.
and
i
might
mention
in
that
context
your
honors
that
2517,
subsection
3
specifically
says
that
there
can
be
no
testimony
in
a
grand
jury
as
to
illegally
--
as
to
electronic
surveillance
evidence
unless
that
evidence
was
obtained
by
means
authorized
by
the
chapter.
so
not
only
do
we
have
the
criminal
sanction
in
2515,
we
have
another
separate
section
which
talks
about
use
of
evidence
in
a
grand
jury
on
the
condition
that
it's
obtained
by
means
authorized
under
the
statute.
now,
the
government
has
suggested
that
notwithstanding
the
broad
language
of
2515
and
the
existence
of
the
criminal
sections
and
so
on,
that
there
are
some
limitation
imposed
by
the
motion
to
suppress
section
which
is
2518
subsection
10
a.
the
first
requirement
of
2518
(10)
(a)
is
that
sister
egan
being
aggrieved
person
and
an
aggrieved
person
is
statutorily
defined
as
a
person
whose
own
conversations
were
intercepted,
whose
own
wire
or
all
communication
were
overheard.
there
is
no
requirement
that
such
a
person
be
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
proceeding
and
indeed,
congress
expressly
rejected
that
condition
in
the
statute.
in
1967,
senator
mcclellan
introduced
the
bill
into
the
senate,
which
defined
aggrieved
party
as
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
proceeding.
now
that
bill
wasn’t
passed
and
in
1968,
senator
hruska
introduced
a
subsequent
bill
which
changed
that
language
and
defined
aggrieved
person
as
a
party
to
a
communication.
and
the
legislative
history
isn't
cited
in
the
brief,
but
a
section
by
section
comparison
of
these
two
provisions
can
be
found
in
the
congressional
record
at
volume
114,
part
10,
90th
congress
2nd
session,
page
13211.
now,
in
addition
to
the
aggrieved
party
terminology
in
the
--
aggrieved
person
terminology
in
the
section,
which
sister
egan
clearly
is,
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
a
grand
jury
inquiry
constitutes
a
proceeding
as
that
word
is
used
in
a
statute
and
indeed
hale
versus
henkel
which
was
mentioned
earlier
by
mr.
justice
douglas
is
most
opposite
in
that
regard
as
our
cases
like
capaldi
(ph)
versus
the
united
states
or
other
cases,
which
arise
in
the
context
of
contempt
hearings
held
to
adjudicate
issues
that
arise
in
the
grand
jury.
and
in
addition
to
the
meaning
of
the
word
proceeding,
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
a
proceeding
on
an
order
compelling
testimony
initiated
by
the
government
is
also
a
proceeding
before
a
court
under
authority
of
the
united
states
which
is
the
language
in
2518
(10)
(a)
and
in
an
application
on
a
government
--
a
hearing
on
a
government
application
for
a
contempt
would
likewise
be
covered
by
the
statute.
and
indeed,
judge
gibbons'
dissent
in
the
egan
case
in
the
third
circuit
concedes
this
point.
it
concedes
that
notwithstanding
any
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
a
grand
jury
is
covered
certainly
in
a
contempt
application
or
hearing
in
an
order
to
compel
testimony
would
be
covered
by
the
statute
and
i
believe
he
refers
to
that
as
a
non-issue.
now,
the
government
draws
--
tries
to
draw
support
from
the
omission
of
the
term
grand
jury
in
2518
(10)
(a)
and
it
parallels
that
omission
with
the
omission
of
legislative
committees
and
it
says
that
those
two
omissions
indicate
an
intent
on
the
part
of
congress
not
to
make
the
2515
remedy
available
to
witnesses
before
such
bodies.
now,
to
reference
the
omission
to
legislative
committees
is
really
very
interesting
because
the
analysis,
let
me
step
back
for
a
second.
as
we’ve
analyzed
2518
(10)
(a),
we’ve
drawn
a
distinction
between
the
situation
of
an
actual
witness
as
opposed
to
someone
who
isn’t
subpoenaed,
and
therefore,
not
in
the
grand
jury
or
not
brought
before
the
court,
a
distinction
between
parties
and
non-parties
and
there’s
a
very
curious
sense
in
the
legislative
history
of
2518
(10)
(a)
from
which
we
draw
support
for
our
position
on
the
distinction.
the
sense
and
i
believe
it
may
have
been
referred
to
by
government
counsel
in
explaining
the
omission
of
legislative
committees
says,
“nor
was
this
provision
intended
to
grant
to
the
federal
courts'
jurisdiction
over
the
congress
itself.”
and
the
case
cited
is
hearst
versus
black.
now,
i’ll
come
to
hearst
versus
black
in
a
sense,
but
there's
something
very
curious
about
the
sense
from
the
legislative
history
that
i
just
spoke
off.
not
only
does
it
appear
to
contradict
the
inclusion
of
legislative
committees
in
2515,
it
also
appears
to
conflict
with
the
line
of
cases
in
this
court,
most
notably,
watkins
versus
the
united
states,
which
do
hold
that
the
federal
courts
do
have
the
power
and
indeed
the
duty
to
review
the
propriety
of
congressional
action
if
and
when
a
legislative
witness
is
brought
to
a
contempt
proceeding.
and
then
we
turn
to
hearst
versus
black
which
is
cited
in
the
government’s
brief.
hearst
versus
black
was
a
case
in
which
a
senate
subcommittees
subpoenaed
telegraph
records
from
the
telegraph
company
and
not
from
hearst.
presumably,
those
records
related
to
hearst
and
he
saw
it
to
intervene
to
prevent
the
committees’
use
of
those
documents
in
its
proceeding.
and
what
the
court
said
was
that
in
as
much
as
mr.
hearst
hadn’t
been
subpoenaed,
wasn’t
before
the
committee,
hadn’t
been
ordered
to
testify,
he
couldn’t
intervene
and
simply
stopped
the
proceedings.
and
most
significant,
the
case
went
on
to
say
that
if
hearst
had
been
before
the
committee
as
a
subpoenaed
witness,
he
would
have
the
right
to
litigate
the
lawfulness
of
the
committee's
action.
and
that’s
precisely
what
we’re
talking
about
in
our
analysis
of
2518
(10)
(a)
when
we
say
there's
a
world
of
difference
and
it's
not
too
hard
to
ascertain
and
answer
to
the
question
that
mr.
justice
white
i
think
asked
earlier
between
someone
who
subpoenaed,
and
therefore,
before
the
court
to
compel
testimony
or
any
contempt
hearing
and
someone
who
isn’t
subpoenaed.
there’s
a
difference
between
sister
egan
whose
called
in
and
compelled
to
divulge
and
disclose
her
own
conversations
as
opposed
to
a
third
party
agent
or
somebody
else
who
comes
in
and
testifies
without
her
knowledge.
now,
she
may
not
be
able
to
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
it
would
be
still
be
a
crime
if
the
agent
did
it,
she
may
not
be
able
to
stop
that.
and
such
a
holding
would
be
consistent
with
cases
like
hearst
and
blue
versus
united
states
which
i
will
come
to
in
a
moment.
there's
a
very
important
distinction
between
someone
who
is
subpoenaed
and
is
compelled
to
testify
and
someone
whose
own
rights
of
privacy
may
have
been
invaded,
but
not
by
the
actions
of
the
prosecutor
or
the
grand
jury
or
the
court.
now,
the
subject
or
18
u.s.c.
3504
has
come
up
and
i
think
that
that
section
is
absolutely
crucial.
the
government
has
said
that
what
could
be
more
anomalous
than
congress
using
in
3504
widening
the
rights
that
hadn’t
been
made
available
in
title
iii
which
was
passed
in
1968
because
the
government’s
position
is
that
title
iii
didn’t
give
the
witness
any
rights.
well,
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
it
would’ve
been
very
anomalous
if
3504
had
changed
title
iii
and
that
in
fact
it
did
didn’t
change
title
iii
and
that
moreover,
the
inclusion
of
grand
juries
in
3504
was
an
express
adoption
of
the
provisions
of
title
iii
which
had
been
enacted
two
years
earlier
and
moreover
in
that
context,
the
government’s
position
that
since
a
witness
isn’t
a
party
as
such
to
a
grand
jury
proceeding,
he
or
she
doesn’t
have
any
rights
to
object
to
surveillance,
that
position
makes
the
plain
language
of
3504
nonsensible
because
not
only
does
3504
include
the
term
grand
jury,
it
also
talks
about
aggrieved
parties
and
clearly,
what
that
section
would
envision
(voice

mr.
jack
j.
levine
i
am
sorry.
mr.
jack
j.
levine
who
were
the
parties?
mr.
jack
j.
levine
well,
the
witnesses
in
the
proceeding.
mr.
jack
j.
levine
well,
i
would
suggest
sir
that
you
become
party
to
a
judicial
proceeding
if
and
when
the
government
seeks
affirmatively
to
bring
you
in
before
a
judge
and
seek
to
use
the
power
of
the
court
to
compel
your
testimony.
mr.
jack
j.
levine
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
j.
levine
no
sir,
i
understood
mr.
justice
marshall’s
question
to
be
who
would
be
a
party
to
a
grand
jury
proceeding.
am
i
not
correct?
mr.
jack
j.
levine
no
your
honor,
i
wasn’t
talking
about
(voice
overlap).
mr.
jack
j.
levine
no,
i
was
talking
about
the
significance
of
being
involuntarily
made
a
party
to
a
court
proceeding
in
which
the
evidence
is
sought
to
be
compelled
from
you
and
then
further
being
made
a
party
to
a
contempt
proceeding
and
what
our
position
is
and
indeed
there
was
no
pre-testimony
motion
to
suppress
file
in
this
case
is
that
if
and
when
the
government
seeks
affirmatively
to
invoke
the
power
of
the
court,
the
court
is
duty
bound
not
to
compel
testimony
to
compel
divulgence
and
disclosure
in
express
violation
in
expressed
violation
of
2511
(c)
and
(d)
unless
and
until
there
has
been
a
determination
that
the
surveillance
was
lawful.
mr.
jack
j.
levine
your
honor,
there
are
--
you're
talking
about
post
indictment?
mr.
jack
j.
levine
i
would
say
--
mr.
jack
j.
levine
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
j.
levine
well,
the
defendant
can't
challenge
it
because
he
hasn’t
been
indicted
yet
presumably
and
once
he
is
indicted
and
you
present
with
a
blue
kind
of
situation,
then
he’s
got
adequate
pretrial,
trial
and
post
trial
motions
that
he
can
use.
mr.
jack
j.
levine
so
far
as
i
know,
there
aren’t
any
constitutional
cases
on
that.
there
is
--
i
can
refer
the
court
to
(voice
overlap).
mr.
jack
j.
levine
right
and
i
would
suggest
that
also
in
that
sense,
in
other
words
because
it
talks
about
defending
with
(voice
overlap).
mr.
jack
j.
levine
yes
sir
and
certainly
a
witness
would
have
that
--
would
be
one
(voice
overlap).
mr.
jack
j.
levine
yes
sir,
i
would
say
that
is
true.
mr.
jack
j.
levine
well,
(voice
overlap).
mr.
jack
j.
levine
it's
clearly
the
witness.
mr.
jack
j.
levine
i
can't
think
of
anybody
else,
no.
quite
frankly
i
haven’t
given
it
much
thought.
i
mean,
it
appears
to
me
that
the
whole
(voice
overlap).
mr.
jack
j.
levine
yes
sir,
but
as
far
as
i
can
conceive,
a
witness
is
clearly
involved
in
a
grand
jury
proceeding
if
and
when
he
or
she
is
brought
to
a
contempt
or
proceeding
or
a
proceeding
at
an
order
to
compel
grand
jury
testimony,
the
witness
would
have
a
right
to
have
an
affirmance
or
a
denial
of
surveillance.
mr.
jack
j.
levine
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
j.
levine
yes
sir,
it
is.
mr.
jack
j.
levine
your
honor,
the
only
way
i
can
account
for
is
by
this
distinction
that
i've
drawn
between
parties
and
non-parties.
mr.
jack
j.
levine
well
yes
sir
it
would.
take
a
situation
where
there’s
been
some
illegal--
there's
been
an
invasion
of
privacy
under
the
statute
and
the
person
whose
own
privacy
was
invaded
was
not
subpoenaed
before
the
grand
jury,
but
some
third
part
was
called
as
a
witness
to
introduce
the
tapes
or
whatever.
now,
that
would
be
a
situation
in
which
the
person
whose
rights
were
invaded
would
not
be
under
2518
(10)
(a),
would
not
be
able
to
keep
that
evidence
out
of
the
grand
jury
because
he
or
she
wasn't
an
actually
before
it.
now,
that’s
the
kind
of
example
i
could
think
off
of
a
situation
where
rights
could
be
deemed
violated
under
--
in
a
grand
jury,
but
it
would
make
sense
to
exclude
--
well,
i
am
not
being
--
what
i’m
basically
saying
is
that
there
are
some
situations
where
you
would
have
an
invasion
of
rights
in
the
grand
jury,
but
there
wouldn’t
be
an
appropriate
forum
in
which
the
person
whose
rights
were
invaded
would
be
able
to
litigate
the
issue.
and
traditionally,
the
way
these
cases
have
come
up
is
that
you
don’t
get
a
decision
from
the
foreman
of
the
grand
jury
or
whoever
as
to
whether
or
not
your
rights
are
being
violated.
you
refuse
to
testify
for
one
reason
or
another
and
then
you
brought
before
the
court
and
our
position
is
that
anybody
whose
put
in
that
position
does
have
standing
under
the
statute.
mr.
jack
j.
levine
well
i
think
its
sufficient
either
way
and
i
think
that
(voice
overlap).
mr.
jack
j.
levine
well,
for
the
same
reason
that
they
included
legislative
committee
in
one
section
and
not
in
another.
there
maybe
situations
where
your
rights
are
being
violated
there,
but
in
as
much
you're
not
a
party,
there's
nothing
you
can
do
about
it.
in
that
context,
you
maybe
able
to
file
a
civil
suit
or
something
like
that.
that’s
the
only
way
i
can
account
for
the
omission
and
i
think
that
for
present
purposes
and
in
the
way
in
which
this
case
arose,
the
issue
may
not
be
crucial
because
there
wasn’t
any
motion
to
suppress
for
a
pre-testimony.
the
issue
arouse
at
the
--
there
was
a
refusal
to
answer
and
then
the
witness
sister
egan
was
brought
to
the
hearing
on
the
application
to
compel
testimony
and
then
the
contempt
proceeding.
now
really,
i
think
that
it’s
important
to
understand
that
what
the
government
is
saying
in
this
case
is
that
not
withstanding
2511
(c)
and
(d)
and
not
withstanding
2515,
and
not
withstanding
3504,
that
these
statutes
just
don’t
apply
because
grand
jury
doesn’t
mean
grand
jury.
it
means
something
else
and
to
divulge
or
disclose
doesn’t
mean
that,
it
means
something
else.
and
not
only
are
they
urging
that
position
for
the
proposition
that
the
witness
doesn't
have
standing,
they're
saying
in
addition
that
when
the
witness
is
brought
before
the
court,
the
court’s
got
no
power
to
do
anything
about
it
and
in
fact,
it
has
to
compel
without
choice,
the
commission
of
a
statutory
crime
and
through
the
express
provisions
of
2511.
and
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
that
that’s
an
unacceptable
interpretation
both
of
the
statute
and
apart
from
the
statute,
under
the
supervisory
power
of
this
court.
and
i
would
suggest
the
case
like
elkins
versus
united
states
where
you’ve
got
the
imperative
of
judicial
integrity
involved
and
indeed
the
express
legislative
finding
in
title
iii,
in
section
801
(b)
as
enacted
was
the
need
to
protect
the
integrity
of
court
and
administrative
proceedings.
and
i
suggest
to
this
court
that
judge
ryde
was
correct
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
dc
circuit
when
he
said
that
to
hold
otherwise
would
be
the
stand
our
whole
system
of
criminal
justice
on
its
head.
mr.
jack
j.
levine
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
j.
levine
the
denial
by
way
of
affidavit
in
the
absence
of
any
evidence
to
the
contrary
has
been
accepted
by
every
court
that’s
had
this
question
before
it.
it
has
happened
in
the
third
circuit
since
egan
came
down.
it
has
happened
in
the
(voice
overlap).
mr.
jack
j.
levine
in
the
absence
--
i
would
say
that
that’s
probably
what
would
happen.
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
j.
levine
i
think
that’s
right,
yes.
i
don’t
think
there's
any
question
about
it
and
indeed
the
other
case
(voice
overlap).
mr.
jack
j.
levine
well,
all
i
can
say
is
that
so
far
as
sister
egan
is
concerned,
had
they
done
that
there,
this
case
wouldn’t
be
here,
and
she
would
have
either
testified
or
or
in
jail,
but
in
the
process
(voice
overlap).
mr.
jack
j.
levine
i’m
sorry
your
honor,
i
didn’t
follow
that.
mr.
jack
j.
levine
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
j.
levine
yes
sir,
and
that’s
what's
happening
every
[voice
overlap].
mr.
jack
j.
levine
well
yes
sir
and
[voice
overlap].
mr.
jack
j.
levine
yes
sir
and
that’s
what's
happened
in
the
mark’s
case
in
the
first
circuit
and
then
in
the
other
cases
that
have
come
up.
in
other
words,
the
government
took
the
position
that
she
doesn’t
have
a
right
to
know
either
way.
and
she
said
that
she
did
and
that’s
how
the
case
came
up
on
appeal.
now,
since
then,
the
government
has
taken
a
different
position
in
a
number
of
cases
and
have
filed
wire
tap
disclaimers.
they’ve
done
it
in
the
third
circuit,
the
first
circuit,
the
sixth
circuit
i
believe
or
the
seventh
circuit
and
indeed,
they’ve
done
it
in
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
russo
case
--
mr.
jack
j.
levine
you
mean
with
that
[voice
overlap].
mr.
jack
j.
levine
well
she
--
i’m
not
sure
i’m
not
sure
i
follow
this,
but
i
--
what
i’m
trying
to
say
is
that
if
in
fact
there
is
a
remand,
it
has
to
be
for
the
purpose
i
would
say
of
the
government
filing
its
affidavit,
having
her
brought
before
the
court
and
say,
“okay,
the
issue
is
settled
now.
now,
will
you
or
will
you
not
testify?”
mr.
jack
j.
levine
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
j.
levine
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
j.
levine
no,
i
don’t
see
how
you
--
it
seems
to
me
that
--
well,
quite
frankly,
i
hadn’t
--
i
actually
hadn’t
thought
about
this,
to
be
perfectly
honest
with
you.
the
case
is
going
to
be
decided.
if
in
fact
it's
decided
adversely
to
us,
that’s
it.
if
it's
decided
favorably
to
us,
then
there'll
be
a
remand
anyway
for
the
same
purpose
that
you
just
suggested
that
the
government
should
put
the
affidavit.
mr.

well
not
on
the
record
before
the
court.
mr.
jack
j.
levine
well,
first
of
all,
the
solicitor
general
is
not
the
person
that
(voice

mr.
jack
j.
levine
yes
sir.
well,
if
in
fact
that’s
the
case
then
i
would
say
that
there's
no
difference,
but
there
definitely
has
to
be
--
dis-affirmation
has
to
be
in
the
record.
mr.
jack
j.
levine
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
j.
levine
yes
sir,
the
issue
[voice

mr.
jack
j.
levine
well,
regardless
of
what
happens
one
way
or
another,
the
issue
is
going
to
be
decided.
mr.
jack
j.
levine
it's
decided
adversely
to
us
--
mr.
jack
j.
levine
that’s
what
i
was
(voice

mr.
jack
j.
levine
i’m
sorry,
i
thought
what
i
was
saying
before
was
that
she
can't
be
held
if
in
fact
there
is
a
denial
in
the
record,
she
can't
be
held
in
contempt
until
when
confirmed
with
that
she
says,
“right,
okay.”[voice
overlap].
mr.
jack
j.
levine
that’s
right.
yes
sir.
i’m
sorry
and
when
i
say
that’s
what
happened
in
the
mark’s
case,
that’s
exactly
what
happened
in
the
mark’s
case.
mr.
jack
j.
levine
thank
you
sir.
