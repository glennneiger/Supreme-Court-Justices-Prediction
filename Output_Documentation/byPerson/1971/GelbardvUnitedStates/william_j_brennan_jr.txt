justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
mr.
friedman,
in
light
of
what
you
now
say,
why
shouldn’t
we
just
vacate
this
and
send
it
back
and
let
you
start
all
over
again
in
the
district
court?
why
should
we
grapple
with
these
problems
if
the
case
is
going
to
disappear?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
alright,
then
you’ll
have
to
--
you’ll
have
an
issue
then
that
shall
be
determined
in
the
district
court
but
why
should
we?
don’t
we
have
enough
things
to
do
around
here
without
dealing
with
cases
on
hypothesis?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
take
it
that
we
send
it
back
to
the
court
of
appeals,
opinion
would
be
vacated
too,
wouldn’t
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
every
time
we
(voice
overlap).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
anyway,
i
thought
the
question
of
party
was
whether
party
to
an
oral
communication,
isn’t
it,
aggrieved
means
party
to
an
oral
communication?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
an
intercepted
oral
communication,
is
that
what
you're
talking
about?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
levine.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
would
have
been
your
position
in
the
district
court
if
the
government
had
done
what
its
done
on
this
court
and
denied
in
the
words
of
3504
the
occurrence
of
the
alleged
unlawful
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
that
if
a
government
has
come
in
with
an
affidavit
and
denied
any
wiretap
and
the
interception
of
any
conversation
with
sister
egan,
that
would’ve
been
accepted
without
more,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
you
would
not
have
been
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
the
government
tells
us
here,
it
does
what
perhaps
it
should
have
done
in
the
district
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
should
we
let
this
go
back
to
the
district
court
and
vacate
everything
that’s
come
up
here
and
let
it
go
back
and
start
over
again?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
she's
been
adjudged
in
contempt.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
what
we’d
have
to
do
would
be
vacate
the
adjudication
in
contempt
and
everything
else
that’s
happened
and
go
back
and
have
the
government
file
its
affidavit
and
deny
that
there
was
ever
any
tap
or
any
interception
of
any
oral
communication
of
hers
and
that
then
puts
her
in
the
position
where
she
can
go
back
before
the
grand
jury
and
testify
or
not,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
have
the
impression
and
i
think
i’m
right
that
this
court
has
accepted
disclaimers
of
wire
tapping
made
by
the
solicitor
general
and
acted
on
it
without
more?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
back
to
the
5315
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that’s
what
i’m
suggesting.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
we
vacate
the
precedent
outstanding
adjudication
of
contempt
to
give
her
that
opportunity.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though
nothing
had
been
done
in
that
time
below?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why?
i
just
don’t
understand
that.
why
should
your
client
be
in
contempt
no
matter
how
we
decide
the
other
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
the
affirmation
of
denial
was
made
below
and
she
goes
and
willing
to
appear
and
testify
before
the
grand
jury,
and
because
we
decide
the
other
case
in
the
government’s
favor
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that’s
right.
because
nevertheless
she
won't
appear
to
testify.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
case
now?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
it’s
already
been
vacated,
the
contempt?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
mr.
friedman,
in
light
of
what
you
now
say,
why
shouldn’t
we
just

william

you’ll

that
shall
