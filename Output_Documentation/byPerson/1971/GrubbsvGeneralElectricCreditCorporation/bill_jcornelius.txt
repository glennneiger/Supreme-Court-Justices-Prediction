mr.
bill
j.cornelius
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
a
judgment
canceling
a
note
and
for
$20,000
damages
recovered
on
the
merits
by
the
petitioner
t.r.
grubbs
in
united
states
district
court
against
general
electric
credit
corporation,
after
the
case
had
been
removed
from
the
united
states
court,
from
state
court
to
united
states
government
which
was
the
party
throughout
the
proceeding.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
case
was
improperly
removed
and
ordered
that
it
would
be
remanded
to
the
state
court.
we
on
certiorari
are
asking
this
honorable
court
to
reverse
the
ruling
of
the
court
of
appeal
and
sustain
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
district
court
which
rendered
its
judgment
on
the
merits.
the
case
arose
in
this
manner.
it
was
originally
filed
by
general
electric
credit
corporation
in
state
court
against
t.r.grubbs
who
is
a
small
businessman
in
jefferson,
texas.
the
case
was
filed
on
simple
note,
to
collect
a
promissory
note.
when
the
case
was
filed
in
state
court,
the
petitioner
grubbs
answered
on
the
merits,
claiming
the
invalidity
of
the
promissory
note
and
also
filed
a
cross
action
against
general
electric
credit
corporation
and
the
general
electric
company,
alleging
that
these
two
companies
had
conspired
together
in
an
unlawful
attempt
which
was
successful
to
destroy
his
business
by
torturous
and
wrongful
conduct
in
violation
of
both
the
state
and
the
federal
antitrust
laws.
the
petitioner
grubbs
then
amended
his
pleadings
and
brought
in
the
united
states
government
in
order
to
determine
the
priority
of
various
liens
being
claimed
against
the
petitioner
by
the
government
and
other
parties.
when
the
government
was
brought
into
the
case
and
state
court,
it
filed
a
petition
for
removal
and
the
case
was
removed
without
objection
or
without
motion
to
remand
on
the
part
of
any
party.
in
united
states
court
after
removal,
the
united
states
government
filed
an
answer
claiming
that
its
lien
was
indeed
prior
to
the
other
liens
being
asserted
against
mr.
grubbs,
and
the
government
also
filed
a
cross
action
against
general
electric
credit
corporation
and
the
general
electric
company,
alleging
that
they
had
conspired
together
to
injure
and
destroy
the
petitioner
grubb's
business
and
thereby
had
tortuously
interfered
and
not
only
with
the
petitioner's
business
but
with
the
interest
of
the
government,
its
lien
which
it
had
on
the
asset
of
grubbs.
no
party
objected
to
removal.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
yes
your
honor
we
believe
it
was,
and
--
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
no
your
honor,
but
at
the
time,
we
filed
this
pleading.
we
had
not
briefed
the
question
carefully
and
we
were
at
that
time
under
the
impression
that
the
state
court
could
not
construe
the
federal
antitrust
laws,
but
could
enforce
them
concurrently
with
federal
court.
we
later
discovered
that,
that
was
incorrect.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
yes
your
honor,
i
understood
him
to
ask
if
it
was
proper
for
us
to
bring
the
government
in.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
not
against
the
government.
no
your
honor.
so
when
this
was
--
when
the
removal
was
effective,
there
was
no
petition,
no
motion
for
remand,
no
objection
to
jurisdiction,
all
of
the
parties
answered
on
the
merits.
the
united
states
government
asserted
affirmative
release
in
tort
against
gecc
and
ge
as
we
were
doing.
ge
and
gecc
filed
a
number
of
amended
pleadings.
they
consented
fully
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
and
after
being
in
the
federal
court,
for
a
year
and
eight
months,
trial
was
held
on
the
merits.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
yes
your
honor,
that's
correct.
in
the
judgment
on
the
merits,
the
general
electric
company
was
absorbed.
the
united
states
government
was
denied
relief,
and
the
petitioner
grubbs
recovered
judgment
of
$20,000
in
damages
against
general
electric
credit
corporation.
so
the
appeal
has
been
by
general
electric
credit
corporation
in
the
absence
of
the
other
parties.
but,
i
would
like
to
make
clear
that
in
the
trial
on
the
merits,
all
these
parties
were
active
participants
in
the
trial,
filed
amended
pleadings,
filed
motions
for
continuances,
participated
in
pre-trial,
hearings
and
pre-trial
orders,
and
everyone
of
them
made
motions
to
the
court
for
judgment
on
the
merits.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
including
the
united
states,
yes
your
honor.
then,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
general
electric
credit
corporation
appealed
on
the
merits
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
no
your
honor,
they
were
denied
relief.
they
did
move
the
court
for
judgment
on
their
behalf,
but
it
was
denied.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
general
electric
was
absorbed
of
liabilities.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
general
electric
--
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
on
general
electric
company,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
no
your
honor.
you
see
after
judgment
on
the
merits
in
the
trial
court,
there
was
only
left
petitioner
grubbs
and
gecc.
gecc
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
merits,
no
question
was
raised
about
jurisdiction
and
the
court
of
appeals
raised
the
issue
on
its
own
motion
and
requested
supplemental
briefs
on
the
question
of
jurisdiction.
these
were
provided
thorough
briefs
on
both
sides
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
a
lack
of
jurisdiction
and
ordered
remand.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
i
think
--
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
yes
it
was
your
honor.
very
thoroughly
argued
in
the
supplemental
briefs
and
is
also
covered
in
our
briefs
here
in
this
court.
we
take
the
position,
may
it
please
the
court
that
in
as
much
as
united
states
district
court
in
the
case
at
bar
had
the
organic
power
to
hear
this
controversy.
in
other
words,
had
congress
understood
the
controversy
for
many
different
reasons,
it
was
error
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
remand
the
case
to
the
state
court
even
if
we
assume
that
removal
was
not
authorized,
and
we
don't
concede
that.
we
believe
that
removal
was
authorized.
but,
we
believe
the
issue
is
moot
and
immaterial
because
whether
removal
was
authorized
or
not,
all
parties
consented
to
trial
on
the
merits
by
the
united
states
court
and
appealed
to
that
court
for
relief
and
for
a
determination
of
the
entire
controversy.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
your
honor.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
not
if
there
was
a
lack
of
jurisdiction.
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
but,
if
there
is
jurisdiction,
then
the
defects
or
even
the
unauthorized
removal
we
submit
can
be
waived.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
what
was
the
head
of
federal
--
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
the
federal
court
jurisdictions,
on
several
grounds
your
honor
and
i
am
going
to
get
to
those
in
just
a
moment.
first
of
all,
because
of
diversity
of
citizenship.
secondly,
because
of
the
presence
of
the
united
sates
antitrust
laws.
thirdly,
because
of
the
presence
of
the
untied
states
government
as
a
party.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
we
take
the
position
your
honor
that
the
presence
of
the
united
states
as
a
party
gives
the
court
original
--
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
without
more.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
yes,
and
also
then
the
government
had
a
lien
on
all
of
the
assets
of
petitioner
grubbs
including
his
accounts
receivable
and
these
were
in
dispute
in
the
lawsuit
and
were
being
dissipated
and
converted
by
general
electric
credit
corporation.
so
the
government
actually
stated
its
grounds
of
removal
as
being
section
2410
and
1444
and
we
are
of
the
opinion
that
they
had
the
right
of
removal
under
those
sections.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
no
your
honor,
never.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
none
whatsoever
your
honor.
in
fact,
all
of
the
parties
actively
appealed
to
the
united
states
district
court
for
a
determination
of
the
controversy.
for
example,
general
electric
credit
corporation
waived
by
written
letter,
the
removal
bond.
they
answered
on
the
merits
in
the
united
states
court.
they
filed
a
motion
for
a
more
definite
statement,
they
filed
a
memorandum
brief,
they
filed
a
motion
for
continuance,
they
filed
a
motion
to
add
new
parties,
they
answered
the
government's
cross
action
on
the
merits,
they
filed
amended
answers,
they
answered
interrogatories,
they
participated
under
preliminary
and
final
pretrial
conferences,
signed
a
pretrial
order,
participated
in
the
trial
and
then
moved
the
us
district
court
for
judgment
on
the
merits.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
yes
your
honor,
entirely.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
was
never
even
mentioned
in
the
argument
before
the
court
of
appeals
mr.
justice
douglas.
we
take
the
position,
may
it
please
the
court
that
the
case
is
by
this
honorable
court
of
baggs
versus
martin,
mackay
versus
uinta
development
company,
in
re
albert
moore,
kreigh
versus
westinghouse,
church
kerr
and
company.
as
well
as
many
other
cases
sustained
on
point
--
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
no
your
honor
it
was
never
mentioned,
it
was
never
anticipated
by
any
of
the
parties
until
we
received
a
letter
from
the
court
of
appeals
raising
the
questions
sue
sponte.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
it
certainly
does
in
our
opinion
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
it
was
argued
in
the
supplemental
briefs
both
sulfurously
and
enthusiastically.
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion
--
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
i
think
it
was
touched
on
your
honor
in
the
argument
before
the
court
of
appeals
but
most
of
the
time
was
spent
on
the
discussion
of
the
merits.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
more
or
less
mr.
justice
white,
yes.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
yes
sir.
but,
the
court
of
appeals
said
there
was
no
allegation
of
diversity
or
federal
question
and
we
repeatedly
called
the
existence
of
these
matters
to
the
court's
opinion
and
briefed
them
extensively
in
the
supplemental
briefs.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
ordinarily
no
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
but
in
our
case,
it
was
a
cross
action
and
therefore
a
new
action
against
the
general
electric
company
and
so
it
was
not
an
answer,
it
was
a
plaintiff's
complaint
as
against
general
electric
company
and
raised
a
federal
question.
additionally,
when
the
government
got
in,
they
cross
actioned
against
both
ge
and
gecc
raising
the
same
federal
question.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
we
would
claim
that
the
court
had
pendant
jurisdiction
of
the
entire
controversy
your
honor
under
the
circumstances
because
very
similar
situations
have
been
affirmed
on
that
point
in
some
cases
citied
in
our
brief.
but,
you
see
the
federal
court
here
had
jurisdiction
because
of
diversity,
federal-question,
presence
of
the
government
as
a
party.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
yes
sir.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
there
is
some
difference
of
opinion
on
that
point
your
honor,
but
in
my
opinion,
it
would
because
section
2410
gives
parties
the
right
to
sue
the
united
states
government
in
state
court
in
order
to
determine
the
priority
of
liens
or
in
actions
involving
the
title
to
property
or
to
the
lien
of
the
government.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
yes
your
honor,
and
they
did
it
in
this
case.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
yes
your
honor.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
but,
your
honor
we
believe
that
it
is
sufficient
in
our
case
and
we
have
cited
some
cases
in
our
brief
to
the
effect
that
since
the
record
showed
diversity,
there
was
no
necessity
that
there
be
any
formal
--
diversity
case,
any
formal
allegation
of
it.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
yes
your
honor,
very
definitely.
the
cases
of
gordon
versus
third
national
bank
of
chattanooga,
sun
printing
company
versus
edwards
and
kellean
versus
maryland
casualty
company,
all
affirmed
the
proposition
that
if
diversity
is
shown
by
the
record
in
anyway,
in
any
form,
it
is
sufficient
and
they
also
hold
that
mr.
justice
blackmun,
if
residence
is
refereed
to
that,
that
at
least
shifts
the
burden
on
the
opposite
party
to
show
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
residence
and
citizenship
for
the
purpose
of
showing
diversity
by
the
record.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
no
your
honor.
in
fact,
the
respondent
here
concedes
diversity.
but
we
feel
that
the
respondent
here
has
confused
right
of
removal
with
organic
jurisdiction
and
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
any
question
in
our
minds
that
because
the
federal
court
had
the
organic
power
to
hear
this
controversy
from
several
different
standpoints;
when
the
party
is
consented
to
the
removal,
then
the
federal
court
had
jurisdiction.
we
have
diversity
of
citizenship,
we
have
the
existence
of
the
antitrust
laws,
and
then
of
course,
we
have
an
interest
of
the
government,
the
united
states
government
here
had
a
lien
on
the
property
which
was
actually
being
a
part
of
--
and
had
the
government
not
been
in
the
case,
there
was
a
distinct
possibility
that
the
property
on
which
it
had
a
lien
would
be
dissipated
or
would
go
to
someone
else
and
the
government
will
lose
its
land.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
that's
right
your
honor.
the
plaintiff's
claim
was
on
the
promissory
note,
but
when
the
cross
action
was
filed
by
the
petitioner,
there
was
brought
into
dispute
a
question
of
whether
gecc
had
the
right
to
collect
certain
accounts
receivable
on
which
the
united
states
government
had
a
lien
and
whether
or
not
gecc
was
entitled
to
foreclose
and
take
title
to
property
on
which
it
and
the
government
were
both
claiming
the
lien.
so
these
developed
after
the
original
petition
had
been
filed.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
yes
your
honor,
mr.
justice
marshall,
under
texas
law,
you
have
a
lien
which
can
be
created
by
the
chattel
mortgage
and
then
if
you
recover
judgment
on
the
debt,
you
get
a
judgment
lien,
but
it's
different
from
the
chattel
mortgage
lien,
which
both
the
government
and
gecc
were
claiming
on
the
property
involved
here.
then,
we
say
may
it
please
that
court
the
fact
that
the
united
states
government
was
a
party
here
itself
certainly
gave
the
federal
court
cognizance
of
the
controversy,
and
it
is
our
opinion
that
it
gave
the
federal
government
the
right
to
remove
whether
it
brought
itself
under
2410
or
not,
because
the
constitution
says
that
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states
shall
extend
the
cases
in
which
the
government
is
the
party.
we
submit
that
the
decisions
hold
that
this
is
true
whether
the
government
is
a
plaintiff
or
a
defendant
in
this
case,
in
the
case
of
hood
versus
united
states
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
holds
that
even
if
the
federal
court
had
been
completely
without
jurisdiction,
when
the
government
came
in
and
sought
affirmative
relief
in
the
federal
court,
jurisdiction
was
conclusively
established.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
not
automatically
removed
your
honor,
but
if
there
is
no
objection
and
all
parties
proceed
the
trial
voluntarily
in
the
us
court
on
the
merits,
it
would
have
pendant
jurisdiction
of
the
entire
controversy,
even
if
it
later
found
against
some
or
even
all
of
the
federal
grounds
and
we
have
citied
cases
in
our
brief
which
sustain
this
proposition.
i
believe
may
it
please
the
court,
i
will
reserve
the
remaining
time.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
thank
you
your
honor,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
connection
with
the
holdings
of
this
honorable
court
in
baggs
v.
martin
and
the
other
cases
we
have
cited
on
waiver
of
removal,
actually
in
our
case
may
it
please
the
court,
there
are
many
more
recognitions
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
us
court
than
are
to
be
found
in
baggs
v.
martin
or
mackay
v.
uinta
development
company
or
any
of
these
other
cases
and
the
appendix
in
this
case
contains
in
the
court's
docket
interest,
a
list
of
all
of
the
things
that
were
done.
as
i
said
previously,
they
moved
for
judgment
on
the
merits.
they
did
amend
their
pleadings
twice
or
three
times
as
i
recall.
their
responses
to
the
cross
actions
on
the
merits.
now
about
the
judgment
which
petitioner
grubbs
has
obtained,
it
is
against
general
electric
credit
corporation
for
malicious
and
deliberate
injuries
to
his
business
which
resulted
in
the
destruction
of
his
business.
we
take
the
position
that
these
acts
are
prohibited
by
the
united
states
antitrust
laws.
the
cross-action
was
brought
under
those
laws,
and
while
the
court
did
not
conclude
that
we
have
proven
our
conspiracy
between
ge
and
gecc,
the
court
did
find
and
filed
an
extensive
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
indicating
that
there
was
suspicious
circumstances
and
indications
of
a
conspiracy
between
ge
and
gecc.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
yes
your
honor.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
no
your
honor.
at
that
time,
we
were
under
the
impression
that
the
courts
would
have
had
concurrent
jurisdiction
of
it
but
after
briefing
it
more
thoroughly,
we
are
of
the
opinion
now
that
the
united
states
court
had
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
federal
antitrust.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
it
is
for
the
commission
of
acts
which
are
prohibited
by
the
antitrust
laws
as
we
see
it
your
honor.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
yes,
your
honor.
under
both
the
---
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
yes,
yes.
under
state
law?
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
under
state
law
and
acting
in
concert
with
general
electric
company,
under
federal
laws.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
no
your
honor,
it
didn't
say
that.
it
just
said
that
--
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
it
said
that
under
the
evidence,
he
could
not
find
a
conspiracy
between
ge
and
gecc.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
i
am
of
the
opinion
that,
that
it
could
be
your
honor
under
the
deliberate
and
malicious
acts
of
a
single
party
--
but
i
maybe
wrong
on
that,
but
--
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
the
action
on
the
note
your
honor
was
tried
and
the
note
was
canceled
by
the
trial
court,
because
of
the
failure
of
consideration.
you
see
the
note
had
been
given
by
petitioner
grubbs
to
general
electric
credit
corporation
on
the
condition
of
and
in
response
to
certain
agreements
made
by
gecc.
the
evidence
showed
and
the
court
concluded
that
these
agreements
had
been
breached
and
that
therefore
the
consideration
for
the
note
had
failed
and
it
was
void
and
it
was
canceled
by
the
judgment.
then
may
it
please
the
court,
we
would
like
to
discuss
this
point,
mr.
johnson
says
that
the
case
was
not
removable
because
the
antitrust
claims
were
brought
forward
in
a
responsive
pleading.
of
course,
at
the
outset,
we
are
faced
with
this
distinction
that
there
is
a
difference
between
removability
and
jurisdiction.
removability
can
be
waived,
jurisdiction
cannot.
but
additionally,
our
pleadings
was
responsive
as
to
gecc,
but
it
was
not
responsive
as
to
general
electric
company.
it
was
a
new
action
instituted
against
the
general
electric
company,
and
so
could
not
be
considered
a
responsive
pleading
in
that
context.
general
electric
company
could
have
removed.
my
brother
a
moment
ago
was
asked
a
question
could
the
case
have
been
filed
in
the
united
states
court
by
a
certain
party?
it
is
our
contention
that
the
case
could
have
been
filed
in
the
united
states
court
by
any
party;
general
electric,
because
of
diversity
and
antitrust,
gecc
because
of
diversity,
the
united
states
government
because
of
2410,
the
interest
in
property
of
the
federal
government,
its
lien
and
the
fact
that
it
was
a
party
defendant
and
a
cross-plaintiff
and
grubbs
could
have
filed
the
cross-action
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
yes
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
correct.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
that
is
exactly
right
your
honor
because
we
were
a
resident.
however,
we
take
the
position
and
we
think
the
case
has
sustained
this
that
our
residence
within
the
state
is
merely
a
venue
restriction
and
is
rightful
and
in
fact,
i
believe
it
was
just
that
kind
of
a
resident
situation
that's
involved
in
some
of
these
other
cases.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
yes,
it
is.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
yes
sir.
but
we
believe
that,
that
restriction,
it's
clearly
wipable.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
right,
and
we
say
we
are
certainly
not
completely
lacking
in
jurisdiction,
but
had
jurisdiction
or
the
organic
power
to
hear
the
controversy
for
five
or
six
different
reasons.
of
course,
may
it
please
the
court,
we
also
say
that
the
action
was
removable
under
2410.
we
did
not
file
an
interpleader
bill
against
the
government.
we
filed
an
action
under
2410
to
determine
the
priority
of
the
government's
lien.
this
was
not
a
strict
interpleader
case.
2410
is
not
an
interpleader
statute
alone.
it
involves
several
causes
of
action
which
can
affect
the
existence
or
the
priority
of
the
government's
lien.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
furniture,
fixtures
and
equipment
and
mr.
grubbs's
business
and
multi-thousands
of
dollars
worth
of
accounts
receivable,
all
of
which
had
been
assigned
to
the
government
as
security
for
its
note
that
it
had
from
mr.
grubbs.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
an
assignment
of
accounts
receivable.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
under
these
instruments,
we
believe
so.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
yes
your
honor.
we
see
they
had
a
chattel
mortgage
to
begin
with
which
created
lien
upon
all
of
his
property
and
then
this
was
further
secured
by
an
assignment
of
the
accounts
receivable.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
it's
a
pledge,
yes.
and
then
gecc
comes
in
though
and
is
collecting
without
any
authority
whatsoever.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
no,
not
of
the
property
itself.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
well,
no,
possibly
not.
but,
it
would
be
a
lien
under
texas
law,
it's
our
contention.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
chattel
mortgage,
yes,
further
secured
by
an
assignment
of
accounts
receivable
which
were
actually
being
claimed
in
an
adverse
proceeding
between
gecc
and
the
government.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
thank
you
very
much
your
honor.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
a
judgment
canceling
a
note
and
for
$20,000
damages
recovered
on
the
merits
by
the
petitioner
t.r.
grubbs
in
united
states
district
court
against
general
electric
credit
corporation,
after
the
case
had
been
removed
from
the
united
states
court,
from
state
court
to
united
states
government
which
was
the
party
throughout
the
proceeding.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
case
was
improperly
removed
and
ordered
that
it
would
be
remanded
to
the
state
court.
we
on
certiorari
are
asking
this
honorable
court
to
reverse
the
ruling
of
the
court
of
appeal
and
sustain
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
district
court
which
rendered
its
judgment
on
the
merits.
the
case
arose
in
this
manner.
it
was
originally
filed
by
general
electric
credit
corporation
in
state
court
against
t.r.grubbs
who
is
a
small
businessman
in
jefferson,
texas.
the
case
was
filed
on
simple
note,
to
collect
a
promissory
note.
when
the
case
was
filed
in
state
court,
the
petitioner
grubbs
answered
on
the
merits,
claiming
the
invalidity
of
the
promissory
note
and
also
filed
a
cross
action
against
general
electric
credit
corporation
and
the
general
electric
company,
alleging
that
these
two
companies
had
conspired
together
in
an
unlawful
attempt
which
was
successful
to
destroy
his
business
by
torturous
and
wrongful
conduct
in
violation
of
both
the
state
and
the
federal
antitrust
laws.
the
petitioner
grubbs
then
amended
his
pleadings
and
brought
in
the
united
states
government
in
order
to
determine
the
priority
of
various
liens
being
claimed
against
the
petitioner
by
the
government
and
other
parties.
when
the
government
was
brought
into
the
case
and
state
court,
it
filed
a
petition
for
removal
and
the
case
was
removed
without
objection
or
without
motion
to
remand
on
the
part
of
any
party.
in
united
states
court
after
removal,
the
united
states
government
filed
an
answer
claiming
that
its
lien
was
indeed
prior
to
the
other
liens
being
asserted
against
mr.
grubbs,
and
the
government
also
filed
a
cross
action
against
general
electric
credit
corporation
and
the
general
electric
company,
alleging
that
they
had
conspired
together
to
injure
and
destroy
the
petitioner
grubb's
business
and
thereby
had
tortuously
interfered
and
not
only
with
the
petitioner's
business
but
with
the
interest
of
the
government,
its
lien
which
it
had
on
the
asset
of
grubbs.
no
party
objected
to
removal.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
yes
your
honor
we
believe
it
was,
and
--
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
no
your
honor,
but
at
the
time,
we
filed
this
pleading.
we
had
not
briefed
the
question
carefully
and
we
were
at
that
time
under
the
impression
that
the
state
court
could
not
construe
the
federal
antitrust
laws,
but
could
enforce
them
concurrently
with
federal
court.
we
later
discovered
that,
that
was
incorrect.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
yes
your
honor,
i
understood
him
to
ask
if
it
was
proper
for
us
to
bring
the
government
in.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
not
against
the
government.
no
your
honor.
so
when
this
was
--
when
the
removal
was
effective,
there
was
no
petition,
no
motion
for
remand,
no
objection
to
jurisdiction,
all
of
the
parties
answered
on
the
merits.
the
united
states
government
asserted
affirmative
release
in
tort
against
gecc
and
ge
as
we
were
doing.
ge
and
gecc
filed
a
number
of
amended
pleadings.
they
consented
fully
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
and
after
being
in
the
federal
court,
for
a
year
and
eight
months,
trial
was
held
on
the
merits.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
yes
your
honor,
that's
correct.
in
the
judgment
on
the
merits,
the
general
electric
company
was
absorbed.
the
united
states
government
was
denied
relief,
and
the
petitioner
grubbs
recovered
judgment
of
$20,000
in
damages
against
general
electric
credit
corporation.
so
the
appeal
has
been
by
general
electric
credit
corporation
in
the
absence
of
the
other
parties.
but,
i
would
like
to
make
clear
that
in
the
trial
on
the
merits,
all
these
parties
were
active
participants
in
the
trial,
filed
amended
pleadings,
filed
motions
for
continuances,
participated
in
pre-trial,
hearings
and
pre-trial
orders,
and
everyone
of
them
made
motions
to
the
court
for
judgment
on
the
merits.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
including
the
united
states,
yes
your
honor.
then,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
general
electric
credit
corporation
appealed
on
the
merits
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
no
your
honor,
they
were
denied
relief.
they
did
move
the
court
for
judgment
on
their
behalf,
but
it
was
denied.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
general
electric
was
absorbed
of
liabilities.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
general
electric
--
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
on
general
electric
company,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
no
your
honor.
you
see
after
judgment
on
the
merits
in
the
trial
court,
there
was
only
left
petitioner
grubbs
and
gecc.
gecc
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
merits,
no
question
was
raised
about
jurisdiction
and
the
court
of
appeals
raised
the
issue
on
its
own
motion
and
requested
supplemental
briefs
on
the
question
of
jurisdiction.
these
were
provided
thorough
briefs
on
both
sides
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
a
lack
of
jurisdiction
and
ordered
remand.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
i
think
--
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
yes
it
was
your
honor.
very
thoroughly
argued
in
the
supplemental
briefs
and
is
also
covered
in
our
briefs
here
in
this
court.
we
take
the
position,
may
it
please
the
court
that
in
as
much
as
united
states
district
court
in
the
case
at
bar
had
the
organic
power
to
hear
this
controversy.
in
other
words,
had
congress
understood
the
controversy
for
many
different
reasons,
it
was
error
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
remand
the
case
to
the
state
court
even
if
we
assume
that
removal
was
not
authorized,
and
we
don't
concede
that.
we
believe
that
removal
was
authorized.
but,
we
believe
the
issue
is
moot
and
immaterial
because
whether
removal
was
authorized
or
not,
all
parties
consented
to
trial
on
the
merits
by
the
united
states
court
and
appealed
to
that
court
for
relief
and
for
a
determination
of
the
entire
controversy.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
your
honor.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
not
if
there
was
a
lack
of
jurisdiction.
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
but,
if
there
is
jurisdiction,
then
the
defects
or
even
the
unauthorized
removal
we
submit
can
be
waived.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
what
was
the
head
of
federal
--
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
the
federal
court
jurisdictions,
on
several
grounds
your
honor
and
i
am
going
to
get
to
those
in
just
a
moment.
first
of
all,
because
of
diversity
of
citizenship.
secondly,
because
of
the
presence
of
the
united
sates
antitrust
laws.
thirdly,
because
of
the
presence
of
the
untied
states
government
as
a
party.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
we
take
the
position
your
honor
that
the
presence
of
the
united
states
as
a
party
gives
the
court
original
--
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
without
more.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
yes,
and
also
then
the
government
had
a
lien
on
all
of
the
assets
of
petitioner
grubbs
including
his
accounts
receivable
and
these
were
in
dispute
in
the
lawsuit
and
were
being
dissipated
and
converted
by
general
electric
credit
corporation.
so
the
government
actually
stated
its
grounds
of
removal
as
being
section
2410
and
1444
and
we
are
of
the
opinion
that
they
had
the
right
of
removal
under
those
sections.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
no
your
honor,
never.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
none
whatsoever
your
honor.
in
fact,
all
of
the
parties
actively
appealed
to
the
united
states
district
court
for
a
determination
of
the
controversy.
for
example,
general
electric
credit
corporation
waived
by
written
letter,
the
removal
bond.
they
answered
on
the
merits
in
the
united
states
court.
they
filed
a
motion
for
a
more
definite
statement,
they
filed
a
memorandum
brief,
they
filed
a
motion
for
continuance,
they
filed
a
motion
to
add
new
parties,
they
answered
the
government's
cross
action
on
the
merits,
they
filed
amended
answers,
they
answered
interrogatories,
they
participated
under
preliminary
and
final
pretrial
conferences,
signed
a
pretrial
order,
participated
in
the
trial
and
then
moved
the
us
district
court
for
judgment
on
the
merits.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
yes
your
honor,
entirely.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
was
never
even
mentioned
in
the
argument
before
the
court
of
appeals
mr.
justice
douglas.
we
take
the
position,
may
it
please
the
court
that
the
case
is
by
this
honorable
court
of
baggs
versus
martin,
mackay
versus
uinta
development
company,
in
re
albert
moore,
kreigh
versus
westinghouse,
church
kerr
and
company.
as
well
as
many
other
cases
sustained
on
point
--
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
no
your
honor
it
was
never
mentioned,
it
was
never
anticipated
by
any
of
the
parties
until
we
received
a
letter
from
the
court
of
appeals
raising
the
questions
sue
sponte.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
it
certainly
does
in
our
opinion
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
it
was
argued
in
the
supplemental
briefs
both
sulfurously
and
enthusiastically.
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion
--
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
i
think
it
was
touched
on
your
honor
in
the
argument
before
the
court
of
appeals
but
most
of
the
time
was
spent
on
the
discussion
of
the
merits.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
more
or
less
mr.
justice
white,
yes.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
yes
sir.
but,
the
court
of
appeals
said
there
was
no
allegation
of
diversity
or
federal
question
and
we
repeatedly
called
the
existence
of
these
matters
to
the
court's
opinion
and
briefed
them
extensively
in
the
supplemental
briefs.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
ordinarily
no
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
but
in
our
case,
it
was
a
cross
action
and
therefore
a
new
action
against
the
general
electric
company
and
so
it
was
not
an
answer,
it
was
a
plaintiff's
complaint
as
against
general
electric
company
and
raised
a
federal
question.
additionally,
when
the
government
got
in,
they
cross
actioned
against
both
ge
and
gecc
raising
the
same
federal
question.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
we
would
claim
that
the
court
had
pendant
jurisdiction
of
the
entire
controversy
your
honor
under
the
circumstances
because
very
similar
situations
have
been
affirmed
on
that
point
in
some
cases
citied
in
our
brief.
but,
you
see
the
federal
court
here
had
jurisdiction
because
of
diversity,
federal-question,
presence
of
the
government
as
a
party.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
yes
sir.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
there
is
some
difference
of
opinion
on
that
point
your
honor,
but
in
my
opinion,
it
would
because
section
2410
gives
parties
the
right
to
sue
the
united
states
government
in
state
court
in
order
to
determine
the
priority
of
liens
or
in
actions
involving
the
title
to
property
or
to
the
lien
of
the
government.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
yes
your
honor,
and
they
did
it
in
this
case.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
yes
your
honor.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
but,
your
honor
we
believe
that
it
is
sufficient
in
our
case
and
we
have
cited
some
cases
in
our
brief
to
the
effect
that
since
the
record
showed
diversity,
there
was
no
necessity
that
there
be
any
formal
--
diversity
case,
any
formal
allegation
of
it.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
yes
your
honor,
very
definitely.
the
cases
of
gordon
versus
third
national
bank
of
chattanooga,
sun
printing
company
versus
edwards
and
kellean
versus
maryland
casualty
company,
all
affirmed
the
proposition
that
if
diversity
is
shown
by
the
record
in
anyway,
in
any
form,
it
is
sufficient
and
they
also
hold
that
mr.
justice
blackmun,
if
residence
is
refereed
to
that,
that
at
least
shifts
the
burden
on
the
opposite
party
to
show
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
residence
and
citizenship
for
the
purpose
of
showing
diversity
by
the
record.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
no
your
honor.
in
fact,
the
respondent
here
concedes
diversity.
but
we
feel
that
the
respondent
here
has
confused
right
of
removal
with
organic
jurisdiction
and
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
any
question
in
our
minds
that
because
the
federal
court
had
the
organic
power
to
hear
this
controversy
from
several
different
standpoints;
when
the
party
is
consented
to
the
removal,
then
the
federal
court
had
jurisdiction.
we
have
diversity
of
citizenship,
we
have
the
existence
of
the
antitrust
laws,
and
then
of
course,
we
have
an
interest
of
the
government,
the
united
states
government
here
had
a
lien
on
the
property
which
was
actually
being
a
part
of
--
and
had
the
government
not
been
in
the
case,
there
was
a
distinct
possibility
that
the
property
on
which
it
had
a
lien
would
be
dissipated
or
would
go
to
someone
else
and
the
government
will
lose
its
land.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
that's
right
your
honor.
the
plaintiff's
claim
was
on
the
promissory
note,
but
when
the
cross
action
was
filed
by
the
petitioner,
there
was
brought
into
dispute
a
question
of
whether
gecc
had
the
right
to
collect
certain
accounts
receivable
on
which
the
united
states
government
had
a
lien
and
whether
or
not
gecc
was
entitled
to
foreclose
and
take
title
to
property
on
which
it
and
the
government
were
both
claiming
the
lien.
so
these
developed
after
the
original
petition
had
been
filed.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
yes
your
honor,
mr.
justice
marshall,
under
texas
law,
you
have
a
lien
which
can
be
created
by
the
chattel
mortgage
and
then
if
you
recover
judgment
on
the
debt,
you
get
a
judgment
lien,
but
it's
different
from
the
chattel
mortgage
lien,
which
both
the
government
and
gecc
were
claiming
on
the
property
involved
here.
then,
we
say
may
it
please
that
court
the
fact
that
the
united
states
government
was
a
party
here
itself
certainly
gave
the
federal
court
cognizance
of
the
controversy,
and
it
is
our
opinion
that
it
gave
the
federal
government
the
right
to
remove
whether
it
brought
itself
under
2410
or
not,
because
the
constitution
says
that
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states
shall
extend
the
cases
in
which
the
government
is
the
party.
we
submit
that
the
decisions
hold
that
this
is
true
whether
the
government
is
a
plaintiff
or
a
defendant
in
this
case,
in
the
case
of
hood
versus
united
states
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
holds
that
even
if
the
federal
court
had
been
completely
without
jurisdiction,
when
the
government
came
in
and
sought
affirmative
relief
in
the
federal
court,
jurisdiction
was
conclusively
established.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
not
automatically
removed
your
honor,
but
if
there
is
no
objection
and
all
parties
proceed
the
trial
voluntarily
in
the
us
court
on
the
merits,
it
would
have
pendant
jurisdiction
of
the
entire
controversy,
even
if
it
later
found
against
some
or
even
all
of
the
federal
grounds
and
we
have
citied
cases
in
our
brief
which
sustain
this
proposition.
i
believe
may
it
please
the
court,
i
will
reserve
the
remaining
time.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
thank
you
your
honor,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
connection
with
the
holdings
of
this
honorable
court
in
baggs
v.
martin
and
the
other
cases
we
have
cited
on
waiver
of
removal,
actually
in
our
case
may
it
please
the
court,
there
are
many
more
recognitions
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
us
court
than
are
to
be
found
in
baggs
v.
martin
or
mackay
v.
uinta
development
company
or
any
of
these
other
cases
and
the
appendix
in
this
case
contains
in
the
court's
docket
interest,
a
list
of
all
of
the
things
that
were
done.
as
i
said
previously,
they
moved
for
judgment
on
the
merits.
they
did
amend
their
pleadings
twice
or
three
times
as
i
recall.
their
responses
to
the
cross
actions
on
the
merits.
now
about
the
judgment
which
petitioner
grubbs
has
obtained,
it
is
against
general
electric
credit
corporation
for
malicious
and
deliberate
injuries
to
his
business
which
resulted
in
the
destruction
of
his
business.
we
take
the
position
that
these
acts
are
prohibited
by
the
united
states
antitrust
laws.
the
cross-action
was
brought
under
those
laws,
and
while
the
court
did
not
conclude
that
we
have
proven
our
conspiracy
between
ge
and
gecc,
the
court
did
find
and
filed
an
extensive
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
indicating
that
there
was
suspicious
circumstances
and
indications
of
a
conspiracy
between
ge
and
gecc.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
yes
your
honor.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
no
your
honor.
at
that
time,
we
were
under
the
impression
that
the
courts
would
have
had
concurrent
jurisdiction
of
it
but
after
briefing
it
more
thoroughly,
we
are
of
the
opinion
now
that
the
united
states
court
had
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
federal
antitrust.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
it
is
for
the
commission
of
acts
which
are
prohibited
by
the
antitrust
laws
as
we
see
it
your
honor.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
yes,
your
honor.
under
both
the
---
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
yes,
yes.
under
state
law?
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
under
state
law
and
acting
in
concert
with
general
electric
company,
under
federal
laws.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
no
your
honor,
it
didn't
say
that.
it
just
said
that
--
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
it
said
that
under
the
evidence,
he
could
not
find
a
conspiracy
between
ge
and
gecc.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
i
am
of
the
opinion
that,
that
it
could
be
your
honor
under
the
deliberate
and
malicious
acts
of
a
single
party
--
but
i
maybe
wrong
on
that,
but
--
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
the
action
on
the
note
your
honor
was
tried
and
the
note
was
canceled
by
the
trial
court,
because
of
the
failure
of
consideration.
you
see
the
note
had
been
given
by
petitioner
grubbs
to
general
electric
credit
corporation
on
the
condition
of
and
in
response
to
certain
agreements
made
by
gecc.
the
evidence
showed
and
the
court
concluded
that
these
agreements
had
been
breached
and
that
therefore
the
consideration
for
the
note
had
failed
and
it
was
void
and
it
was
canceled
by
the
judgment.
then
may
it
please
the
court,
we
would
like
to
discuss
this
point,
mr.
johnson
says
that
the
case
was
not
removable
because
the
antitrust
claims
were
brought
forward
in
a
responsive
pleading.
of
course,
at
the
outset,
we
are
faced
with
this
distinction
that
there
is
a
difference
between
removability
and
jurisdiction.
removability
can
be
waived,
jurisdiction
cannot.
but
additionally,
our
pleadings
was
responsive
as
to
gecc,
but
it
was
not
responsive
as
to
general
electric
company.
it
was
a
new
action
instituted
against
the
general
electric
company,
and
so
could
not
be
considered
a
responsive
pleading
in
that
context.
general
electric
company
could
have
removed.
my
brother
a
moment
ago
was
asked
a
question
could
the
case
have
been
filed
in
the
united
states
court
by
a
certain
party?
it
is
our
contention
that
the
case
could
have
been
filed
in
the
united
states
court
by
any
party;
general
electric,
because
of
diversity
and
antitrust,
gecc
because
of
diversity,
the
united
states
government
because
of
2410,
the
interest
in
property
of
the
federal
government,
its
lien
and
the
fact
that
it
was
a
party
defendant
and
a
cross-plaintiff
and
grubbs
could
have
filed
the
cross-action
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
yes
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
correct.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
that
is
exactly
right
your
honor
because
we
were
a
resident.
however,
we
take
the
position
and
we
think
the
case
has
sustained
this
that
our
residence
within
the
state
is
merely
a
venue
restriction
and
is
rightful
and
in
fact,
i
believe
it
was
just
that
kind
of
a
resident
situation
that's
involved
in
some
of
these
other
cases.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
yes,
it
is.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
yes
sir.
but
we
believe
that,
that
restriction,
it's
clearly
wipable.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
right,
and
we
say
we
are
certainly
not
completely
lacking
in
jurisdiction,
but
had
jurisdiction
or
the
organic
power
to
hear
the
controversy
for
five
or
six
different
reasons.
of
course,
may
it
please
the
court,
we
also
say
that
the
action
was
removable
under
2410.
we
did
not
file
an
interpleader
bill
against
the
government.
we
filed
an
action
under
2410
to
determine
the
priority
of
the
government's
lien.
this
was
not
a
strict
interpleader
case.
2410
is
not
an
interpleader
statute
alone.
it
involves
several
causes
of
action
which
can
affect
the
existence
or
the
priority
of
the
government's
lien.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
furniture,
fixtures
and
equipment
and
mr.
grubbs's
business
and
multi-thousands
of
dollars
worth
of
accounts
receivable,
all
of
which
had
been
assigned
to
the
government
as
security
for
its
note
that
it
had
from
mr.
grubbs.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
an
assignment
of
accounts
receivable.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
under
these
instruments,
we
believe
so.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
yes
your
honor.
we
see
they
had
a
chattel
mortgage
to
begin
with
which
created
lien
upon
all
of
his
property
and
then
this
was
further
secured
by
an
assignment
of
the
accounts
receivable.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
it's
a
pledge,
yes.
and
then
gecc
comes
in
though
and
is
collecting
without
any
authority
whatsoever.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
no,
not
of
the
property
itself.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
well,
no,
possibly
not.
but,
it
would
be
a
lien
under
texas
law,
it's
our
contention.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
chattel
mortgage,
yes,
further
secured
by
an
assignment
of
accounts
receivable
which
were
actually
being
claimed
in
an
adverse
proceeding
between
gecc
and
the
government.
mr.
bill
j.cornelius
thank
you
very
much
your
honor.
