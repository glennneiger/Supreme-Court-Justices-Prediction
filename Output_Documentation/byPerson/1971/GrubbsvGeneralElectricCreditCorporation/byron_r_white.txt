justice
byron
r.
white
can
the
antitrust
claims
be
tried
in
state
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what's
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist?
was
it
a
proper
pleading
or
it
wasn't?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
the
united
states
here
this
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
was
ahead
of
federal
jurisdiction
to
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
head
of
federal
jurisdiction,
would
you
say
that
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
without
that
if
it
is
left
to
the
presence
of
the
united
states
to
party
would
be
what?
what
jurisdiction
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
without
more?
justice
byron
r.
white
without
more.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
court
of
appeals
said
it
was
a
frivolous
claim
against
the
united
states,
sort
of
a
trouped
up
claim,
was
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
it
was
not
--
so
it
was
baseless
that
it
wouldn't
independently
support
removal.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
cornelius
i
suppose
that
if
one
were
a
purist,
pleading
doesn't
support
diversity
jurisdiction.
it
speaks
as
it's
not
uncommon
in
a
state
court
case
of
residence,
not
of
citizenship.
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
certainly
a
plenty
of
circuit
court
opinions
that
this
is
insufficient.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
suit
was
not
removable
by
that
particular
defendant?
justice
byron
r.
white
read
it
for
the
defendant's
concern.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
thought
the
united
states
was
a
party
by
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
united
states
though
wanted
to
remove
it
to
the
federal
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
connection
with
this
very
transaction?
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
we
have
to
talk
about
another
lawsuit
too,
namely
grubbs'
suit
against
general
electric,
grubbs
may
not
have
been
able
to
get
this
promissory
note
case
under
the
federal
court,
but
the
judgment
against
use
on
anti-trust
claims?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
it
for?
justice
byron
r.
white
with
that
law
suit
he
could
have
filed
in
the
federal
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that,
but
it
ended
up
in
federal
court,
and
he
could
have
filed
it
there
originally.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
judgment
of
--
well
not
if
you
were
in
texas.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
one
thing
you
could
have
done
though
that
if
you
dismissed
a
state
action
and
start
all
over
again
in
federal
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
kind
of
a
judgment
did
grubbs
get?
justice
byron
r.
white
against
whom?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
your
$20,000
judgment
was
for
violation
of
the
antitrust
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
your
cross-claim
under
state
law
as
well
as
under
federal
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
malicious
injury
to
your
business?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
federal
district
court
gave
you
judgment
but
said
that
it
wasn't
an
antitrust
claim.
didn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
said
there
wasn't
any
conspiracy.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
there
wasn't,
then
could
it
have
been
an
antitrust
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
incidentally
what
happened
--
and
the
action
--
no
cause
of
action
on
that
order?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
it
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
a
pledge
that
says
all
of
the
--
.
justice
byron
r.
white
can
the
antitrust
claims
be
tried
in
state
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what's
your
answer
to
mr.
