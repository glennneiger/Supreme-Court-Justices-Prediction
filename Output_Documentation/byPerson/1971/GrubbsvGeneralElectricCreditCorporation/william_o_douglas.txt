possessed
a

been
instituted
in

originally.

in

mr.

i

if
you
would

it
in

you
wouldn't
be
here
today
at

justice
william

the
posture
today

is
that

wanted
a

suit
tried
in
the
state
court.
justice
william

douglas
do
you
see
any
difference
in
how
aobut
it'd
be
here
--
you
have
got
two
different
judgments,
all
at
one
judgments,
two
different
recoveries;
one
that
notes
that
declaratory
enforces
about
$66,000.
justice
william
o.
douglas
secondly,
you
have
got
an
separate
judgment
on
$20,000.
justice
william

douglas
--
you
may
have
been
able
to
be
in
the
federal
court
for
that
$20,000
either
on
diversity
or
by
joining
to
the
federal
anti-trust
claims
but
if
ge
got
it
started
first
in
state
court.
there
is
no
way
to
get
that
suit
on
the
notice
out
of
the
state
court
if
you
ignore
the
right
of
the
united
