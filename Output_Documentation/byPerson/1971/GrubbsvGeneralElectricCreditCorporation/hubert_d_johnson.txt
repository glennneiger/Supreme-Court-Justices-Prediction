mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
a
particular
quarrel
with
the
fact
statement,
factual
statements
that
are
made
by
mr.
cornelius
in
the
case.
i
will
certainly
be
the
first
to
agree
that
when
we
received
the
letter
from
the
clerk
of
the
court
which
has
a
text
as
an
direct
appendix
to
my
brief
for
the
respondent,
it
was
the
first
time
that
(inaudible)
that
we
were
in
the
position
of
having
perhaps
vested
on
the
federal
court
jurisdiction
that
it
didn't
have.
and
trial
court
would
closely
with
the
ge
counsel
who
is
a
dallas
counsel
as
i
am
from
dallas,
and
when
it
was
--
when
the
government
was
made
a
party,
it
was
rather
pertinent
and
enigmatic
to
me
because
gecc
did
not
have
a
judgment
at
that
time.
it
was
not
involved
in
the
competition
as
to
whose
lien,
if
anything
was
its
stake.
it
was
not
even
a
party
involved
the
stakeholder
face,
couldn't
really
quite
understand
what
it
was
about,
it
was
just
an
off
shielded
case.
it
got
worse
when
they
removed.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
i
direct
your
attention
because
the
question
that
the
court
asked
and
the
court
asked
to
us
and
we
answered
it
and
we
tried
to
go
on
into
the
rest
of
it.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
i
am
talking
about
appendix
b
to
my
brief,
the
reason
i
put
it,
i
don't
believe
it
appears
on
the
face
of
it
in
the
records.
the
court
says
it
has
came
to
the
court's
attention
that
the
district
court's
removal
of
jurisdiction
has
been
predicated
on
28
u.s.c.a.
2410
and
1444
which
is
a
kind
of
a
procedural
reference
to
2410.
had
even
considered
the
record
on
the
pleading
that
court
has
serious
questions
concerning
an
applicability
of
these
statutes
and
it
may
consider
it
sue
sponte
which
i
needed
to
look
at
the
moment,
but
i've
soon
found
out
that
we
have
to
engage
in
a
new
field.
if
the
case
was
improperly
removed
to
the
federal
court
under
2410
and
1444
could
it
have
been
removed
under
any
other
federal
statute.
i
think
the
answer
to
that
question
had
to
be
no.
general
electric
credit
corporation
made
the
decision
as
to
what
to
be
entered
into
when
it
filed
this
lawsuit.
it
sued
a
texas
resident,
in
the
texas
court,
where
the
texas
resident
lives.
it
could
have
elected
to
go
to
file
a
federal
court
suit,
it
did
not.
it
filed
a
simple
suit
on
a
simple
note
in
a
little
town
down
near
marshall,
texas
with
the
marshall
attorney,
i
was
not
the
attorney
when
it
was
initially
filed.
i
was
not
the
attorney
until
this
antitrust
law
that
got
into
it
--
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
not
by
that
particular
defendant,
that
was
a
resident
defendant
and
the
right
of
removal
was
given
to
the
non
residents.
you
can
check
the
right
of
removability
on
that
statute
and
if
there
is
anything
to
it,
if
we
had
a
choice
to
go
in
the
federal
court,
we
didn't
make
it,
and
not
having
made,
there
is
really
not
anything
we
could
do
there
but
get
back
in
that
posture
again.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
well,
the
defendant
was
a
resident
--
he
had
no
right
of
removal
and
the
court
of
appeals
focussed
the
attention
on
the
status
of
it,
as
at
the
time
that
it
was
removed,
and
as
at
the
time
it
was
removed,
and
there
are
a
lot
of
cases
that
emphasize
that,
that
is
the
point
at
which
you
determine
removability
jurisdiction
as
at
that
time,
2410
was
the
only
thing
we
could
have
in
the
hand
and
if
2410
didn't
fit,
then
it
was
--
it's
been
this,
and
they
thought
that
they
would
have
a
force
to
(inaudible)
and
that
could
not
be
done.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
yes,
but
i
think
one
of
the
reasons
you
have
to
keep
in
mind
and
maybe
i
would
try
to
figure
out
one
of
the
quotes
by
judge
billy
bergley
(ph),
we
will
laugh
on
this,
united
states
was
nowhere
in
sight
when
it
was
argued
at
the
circuit
court
level.
there
was
no
orals,
it
was
not
much
in
sight
in
the
record.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
they
already
thought
and
then
they
sort
of
abandoned
it.
they
thought
they
were
in
it
enough
to
file
a
complaint
against
ge
--
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
but
when
they
were
denied
to
--.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
yes
but
i
do
believe
--
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
not
to
appeal,
but
if
the
(inaudible)
that
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
looking
at
it,
the
government
had
then
denied
even
the
right
as
to
its
lien
claim
and
this
court
said
he
couldn't
pass
on
that.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
not
in
this
at
2410
because
there
was
no
assertion
by
a
lien
on
any
specific
property,
there
was
no
--
the
assertion
on
the
basis
of
(inaudible)
interpleader.
there
was
no
interpleader
aspect
to
it.
the
amended
answer
and
the
cross
action
and
regarding
the
third
party,
the
us
government
admitted
that
they
don't
know
judgments.
there
was
no
case
--
multiple,
single
liability
among
multiple
claimants
and
the
interpleader
statement
was
completely
demolished
and
the
pleading
at
circuit
would
appear.
i
must
confess
we
were
saying
that
i
assume
that
i
did
not
know
until
i've
got
into
it
later,
that
the
government
can
always
remove,
just
because
they
were
a
party.
well,
i
don't
think
i
have
found
any
support
for
that
in
the
subsequent
decisions.
i
thought
case
came
over
up
to
this
court
where
the
both
parties
filed
in
brief
saying
that
the
federal
court
had
removed
the
jurisdiction
and
this
court
said
you
can't
get
that
this
way.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
i
don't
think
it
did.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
well,
i
think
that
if
you're
look
the
portion
of
2410,
that
the
government
is
by
the
law
is
called
interpleader,
this
is
not
an
action
by
the
government,
but
this
was
by
determination
of
rights
over
the
theory
of
the
protection
of
this
multiple
liability.
that
was
the
whole
concept
2410
a5.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
i
don't
think
they're
going
to
ask.
i
think
the
interpleader
concept
is
the
only
thing
that
was
involved
in
it.
not
only
government
was
brought
into
this
case,
for
not
pleading
--
our
pleading
was
a
civil
suit
to
recover
a
judgment,
never
was
recovered
laying
judgment,
abstract
of
judgment
filed,
no
ancillary
process,
none,
if
we've
ever
heard
a
lien
on
anything,
we
would
have
abandoned
it
by
taking
it
--
by
a
separate
desk
suit
or
we
could
have
gotten
it
as
a
judgment
and
then
we
would
have
to
(inaudible)
and
that's
all
that
we
were
seeking
on
this
suit.
now
the
rest
of
this
got
to
tidy
up.
like
judge
goldberg
said,
he
is
very
open
on
the
(inaudible)
goin
gup
in
the
wrong
court.
we
started
that
in
the
right
court.
we
started
in
a
court,
that
we
had
the
right
to
be
in.
the
government
said
when
they
–-
in
other
words
straight
out,
i
guess.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
i
am
aware
of
those
cases
and
i've
attempted
to
read
those
cases
and
i
have
great
difficulty
with
them,
and
i
think
they
were
cited
in
their
supplemented
brief.
i
think
that,
maybe
we
would
have
to
clarify
and
point
out
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
hear
oral
argument
but
turning
to
the
jurisdiction
point.
they
may
--
they
call
for
these
on
the
specific
question,
and
the
next
time
when
they
get
opinion
saying
that
too
bad,
you
are
in
the
wrong
court.
we
don't
know,
we
never
acted
in
second
guessing,
we
don't
know
yet
what
the
circuit
court
woud
have
done
with
our
--
they
are
merits,
though
they
are
based
on
a
state
statute
limitations
and
various
other
aspects
of
state
law,
texas
law
almost
in
private.
that
perhaps
might
have
more
of
a
reason
the
court
felt
that,
that
we
were
trying
to
may
be
conspire
to
really
debate
on
the
question
that
they
shouldn't
have,
but
that
was
a
cornerstone
from
my
mind
but
being
asked
the
question
was
it
property
removed,
was
there
evidence
of
removal?
i
really
couldn't
find
the
evidence
of
removal
and
if
you
found
out
one
of
those,
you
can't
add
removability
to
a
case
by
what
the
answer
says
that
you
could
plead
a
constitutional
question
and
the
answer
--
and
you
do
not
give
federal
question
jurisdiction.
the
answer
just
–
is
doesn't
figure
in
determining
invisibility
and
that's
for
sure.
now
this
--
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
no
question.
it
came
up
completely
by
reason
of
--
if
we
were
to
start
in
the
federal
court,
we
as
a
new
york
corporation,
we
don't
deny
we
are
new
york
corporation,
we
are
sure
that
texas
(inaudible)
and
able
to
seek
$12,000
or
$10,000.
we
could
have
brought
it
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
well,
i
am
in
a
position
that
where
i
don't
believe
that
i
have
the
right
to
say
that
i
will
rollover
and
play
bid,
and
you
can
just
continue
on
the
jurisdiction.
i
don't
really
–
i
read
your
cases,
i
don't
think
i
have
a
right
to
fair
at
the
jurisdiction.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
no,
not
at
all.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
it's
for
tortuous
interference
in
the
business
definition.
it's
business
damage
from
connection
with
the
way
they
terminated
the
dealership
or
of
any
--
the
argument
was
that
this
tortuous
action
filed
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
he
could
have
known
–-
i
don't
think
he
could
have
filed
it
in
federal
court
because
he
was
the
resident,
oh,
yes
he
could
have
on
a
diversity
concept,
that's
true
but
he
simply
had
filed
--
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
that's
correct,
but
that
is
a
lawsuit,
that's
the
lawsuit,
they
need
to
file
themselves
and
they
brought
in
the
civil
court.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
possibly
so.
i
think
he
might
have
had
a
slightly
different
--
think
you
might
had
been
in
new
york.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
gecc
doesn't
operate
except
on
a
sale
position
and
may
be
on
the
long
run
we
might
have
been
able
to
get
it
there
but
i
believe
--
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
filed
it
in
the
state
court.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
that's
correct.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
well,
i
think
you
have
to
--
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
where
that
leads
you
is
to
the
fact
that
the
law
about
not
changing
the
nature
of
the
case
by
the
cross
action,
you're
going
to
have
to
change
some
of
that
law
if
you
arrive
at
that
conclusion.
because
it
was
a
responsive
cross
action
in
the
state
court,
and
it
does
not
change
the
--
it
did
not
let
the
case
removed,
as
such,
mr.
grubbs
would
not
have
removed
himself,
he
did
not
attempt
to
remove.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
well,
he
didn't
have
to
--
if
he
wanted
to
bring
his
tortuous
claim,
his
definition
suit,
he
would
not
require
to
bring,
he
is
not
a
compulsory
counter
claim,
he
could
have
brought
it.
(inaudible)
he
could
have
brought
it
in
whatever
form
he
wished
and
he
did
not
do.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
that's
correct.
it
was
sort
of
mixed
up
with
state
and
federal
but
i
think
that's
--
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
i
think
he
is
right.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
i
don't
know
what
ge's
position
is
in
the
matter.
there
has
been
no
appeal
by
the
government
or
by
them
or
anybody
else
with
respect
to
that,
they
may
have
the
judgment
that
is
depressive
and
can
be
sustained
to
collateral
attack
--
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
i
guess
too.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
no,
denied,
gecc.
i
guess
you
have
a
corporate
corporation
not
on
antitrust,
not
antitrust
--
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
it's
plain
money
judgment
and
the
damages
were
$20,000
–
they
saw
on
the
injury
to
its
business
from
deformation.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
against
general
electric
credit
corporation
that
furnished
the
credit
upon
which
he
operated
and
appliance
dealer
for
general
electric.
this
was
just
in
that
and
there
are
some
accounts
that
have
been
purchased,
some
installments,
those
have
been
been
purchased,
that
he
defaulted
and
then
he
had
been
put
in
the
form
of
note.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
there
is
no
question
that
it
brings
back
memories
of
charles
dickens
's
writings.
there's
no
question
about
that.
there
is
no
question
that
we
--
i
am
trying
to
point
out
that
i
think
that
court
of
appeals
was
viewing
it
i
think
from
what
we
give
him
the
view
it
were
and
i
did
not
except
this
question
to
be
developed
in
the
case
when
it
came
up.
i
couldn't
find
a
suitable
answer.
perhaps
the
answer
is
--
the
question
it
has
put
on
the
grounds
of
removal
maybe
twisted
me
off
a
little
bit.
but,
even
though
as
i
am
getting
it,
i
do
find
that
some
of
the
cases
are
highly
confusing
because
all
of
them
seem
to
have
--
for
instance
we
did
not
move
onto
trial
on
the
plea
when
we
filed
in
the
state
court.
it's
true,
we
did
some
actions
in
the
federal
court,
but
we
never
amended
our
petition,
the
first
provisionary
petition
was
the
only
petition.
that's
what
that's
cast
in
state
court
for
–-
that's
what
that
does
in
attempt
to
say
any
jurisdiction
evolves
in
the
federal
court,
it
would
just
not
in
any.
now
we
did
file
responsive
pleas
to
these
cross-actions
against
us.
we
had
some
in
the
state
court
and
in
the
federal
court,
well
for
the
first
time
the
united
states
government
took
the
(inaudible),
and
we
answered
and
sought
full
trails,
i
recall
those
answers
were
amended
to
bring
them
down
to
date
because
a
more
definite
statement
was
subsequently
filed.
but,
it
was
in
the
state
court
until
the
government
got
in
to
it.
now,
it's
just
as
simple
as
that,
the
government
probably
could
remove,
did
remove;
we
thought
they
could
remove
and
didn't
object.
i
think
that
it's
true
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
discuss
that
banks
case
and
those
cases
that
are
cited
--
the
uinta
case,
but
in
each
and
everyone
of
those
cases
that
i
could
see,
there
were
considerable
elements
of
amended
pleading
and
sort
of
a
new
ball
game
started
over
in
the
federal
court.
i
don't
know
why
that
court
of
appeals
didn't
ask
them.
i
saw
judge
goldberg
lost
that
day
i
wanted
to
ask
him
but
i
figured
may
i
better
--
i
may
have
to
ask
him
about
the
(inaudible)
case
someday.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
a
particular
quarrel
with
the
fact
statement,
factual
statements
that
are
made
by
mr.
cornelius
in
the
case.
i
will
certainly
be
the
first
to
agree
that
when
we
received
the
letter
from
the
clerk
of
the
court
which
has
a
text
as
an
direct
appendix
to
my
brief
for
the
respondent,
it
was
the
first
time
that
(inaudible)
that
we
were
in
the
position
of
having
perhaps
vested
on
the
federal
court
jurisdiction
that
it
didn't
have.
and
trial
court
would
closely
with
the
ge
counsel
who
is
a
dallas
counsel
as
i
am
from
dallas,
and
when
it
was
--
when
the
government
was
made
a
party,
it
was
rather
pertinent
and
enigmatic
to
me
because
gecc
did
not
have
a
judgment
at
that
time.
it
was
not
involved
in
the
competition
as
to
whose
lien,
if
anything
was
its
stake.
it
was
not
even
a
party
involved
the
stakeholder
face,
couldn't
really
quite
understand
what
it
was
about,
it
was
just
an
off
shielded
case.
it
got
worse
when
they
removed.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
i
direct
your
attention
because
the
question
that
the
court
asked
and
the
court
asked
to
us
and
we
answered
it
and
we
tried
to
go
on
into
the
rest
of
it.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
i
am
talking
about
appendix
b
to
my
brief,
the
reason
i
put
it,
i
don't
believe
it
appears
on
the
face
of
it
in
the
records.
the
court
says
it
has
came
to
the
court's
attention
that
the
district
court's
removal
of
jurisdiction
has
been
predicated
on
28
u.s.c.a.
2410
and
1444
which
is
a
kind
of
a
procedural
reference
to
2410.
had
even
considered
the
record
on
the
pleading
that
court
has
serious
questions
concerning
an
applicability
of
these
statutes
and
it
may
consider
it
sue
sponte
which
i
needed
to
look
at
the
moment,
but
i've
soon
found
out
that
we
have
to
engage
in
a
new
field.
if
the
case
was
improperly
removed
to
the
federal
court
under
2410
and
1444
could
it
have
been
removed
under
any
other
federal
statute.
i
think
the
answer
to
that
question
had
to
be
no.
general
electric
credit
corporation
made
the
decision
as
to
what
to
be
entered
into
when
it
filed
this
lawsuit.
it
sued
a
texas
resident,
in
the
texas
court,
where
the
texas
resident
lives.
it
could
have
elected
to
go
to
file
a
federal
court
suit,
it
did
not.
it
filed
a
simple
suit
on
a
simple
note
in
a
little
town
down
near
marshall,
texas
with
the
marshall
attorney,
i
was
not
the
attorney
when
it
was
initially
filed.
i
was
not
the
attorney
until
this
antitrust
law
that
got
into
it
--
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
not
by
that
particular
defendant,
that
was
a
resident
defendant
and
the
right
of
removal
was
given
to
the
non
residents.
you
can
check
the
right
of
removability
on
that
statute
and
if
there
is
anything
to
it,
if
we
had
a
choice
to
go
in
the
federal
court,
we
didn't
make
it,
and
not
having
made,
there
is
really
not
anything
we
could
do
there
but
get
back
in
that
posture
again.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
well,
the
defendant
was
a
resident
--
he
had
no
right
of
removal
and
the
court
of
appeals
focussed
the
attention
on
the
status
of
it,
as
at
the
time
that
it
was
removed,
and
as
at
the
time
it
was
removed,
and
there
are
a
lot
of
cases
that
emphasize
that,
that
is
the
point
at
which
you
determine
removability
jurisdiction
as
at
that
time,
2410
was
the
only
thing
we
could
have
in
the
hand
and
if
2410
didn't
fit,
then
it
was
--
it's
been
this,
and
they
thought
that
they
would
have
a
force
to
(inaudible)
and
that
could
not
be
done.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
yes,
but
i
think
one
of
the
reasons
you
have
to
keep
in
mind
and
maybe
i
would
try
to
figure
out
one
of
the
quotes
by
judge
billy
bergley
(ph),
we
will
laugh
on
this,
united
states
was
nowhere
in
sight
when
it
was
argued
at
the
circuit
court
level.
there
was
no
orals,
it
was
not
much
in
sight
in
the
record.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
they
already
thought
and
then
they
sort
of
abandoned
it.
they
thought
they
were
in
it
enough
to
file
a
complaint
against
ge
--
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
but
when
they
were
denied
to
--.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
yes
but
i
do
believe
--
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
not
to
appeal,
but
if
the
(inaudible)
that
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
looking
at
it,
the
government
had
then
denied
even
the
right
as
to
its
lien
claim
and
this
court
said
he
couldn't
pass
on
that.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
not
in
this
at
2410
because
there
was
no
assertion
by
a
lien
on
any
specific
property,
there
was
no
--
the
assertion
on
the
basis
of
(inaudible)
interpleader.
there
was
no
interpleader
aspect
to
it.
the
amended
answer
and
the
cross
action
and
regarding
the
third
party,
the
us
government
admitted
that
they
don't
know
judgments.
there
was
no
case
--
multiple,
single
liability
among
multiple
claimants
and
the
interpleader
statement
was
completely
demolished
and
the
pleading
at
circuit
would
appear.
i
must
confess
we
were
saying
that
i
assume
that
i
did
not
know
until
i've
got
into
it
later,
that
the
government
can
always
remove,
just
because
they
were
a
party.
well,
i
don't
think
i
have
found
any
support
for
that
in
the
subsequent
decisions.
i
thought
case
came
over
up
to
this
court
where
the
both
parties
filed
in
brief
saying
that
the
federal
court
had
removed
the
jurisdiction
and
this
court
said
you
can't
get
that
this
way.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
i
don't
think
it
did.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
well,
i
think
that
if
you're
look
the
portion
of
2410,
that
the
government
is
by
the
law
is
called
interpleader,
this
is
not
an
action
by
the
government,
but
this
was
by
determination
of
rights
over
the
theory
of
the
protection
of
this
multiple
liability.
that
was
the
whole
concept
2410
a5.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
i
don't
think
they're
going
to
ask.
i
think
the
interpleader
concept
is
the
only
thing
that
was
involved
in
it.
not
only
government
was
brought
into
this
case,
for
not
pleading
--
our
pleading
was
a
civil
suit
to
recover
a
judgment,
never
was
recovered
laying
judgment,
abstract
of
judgment
filed,
no
ancillary
process,
none,
if
we've
ever
heard
a
lien
on
anything,
we
would
have
abandoned
it
by
taking
it
--
by
a
separate
desk
suit
or
we
could
have
gotten
it
as
a
judgment
and
then
we
would
have
to
(inaudible)
and
that's
all
that
we
were
seeking
on
this
suit.
now
the
rest
of
this
got
to
tidy
up.
like
judge
goldberg
said,
he
is
very
open
on
the
(inaudible)
goin
gup
in
the
wrong
court.
we
started
that
in
the
right
court.
we
started
in
a
court,
that
we
had
the
right
to
be
in.
the
government
said
when
they
–-
in
other
words
straight
out,
i
guess.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
i
am
aware
of
those
cases
and
i've
attempted
to
read
those
cases
and
i
have
great
difficulty
with
them,
and
i
think
they
were
cited
in
their
supplemented
brief.
i
think
that,
maybe
we
would
have
to
clarify
and
point
out
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
hear
oral
argument
but
turning
to
the
jurisdiction
point.
they
may
--
they
call
for
these
on
the
specific
question,
and
the
next
time
when
they
get
opinion
saying
that
too
bad,
you
are
in
the
wrong
court.
we
don't
know,
we
never
acted
in
second
guessing,
we
don't
know
yet
what
the
circuit
court
woud
have
done
with
our
--
they
are
merits,
though
they
are
based
on
a
state
statute
limitations
and
various
other
aspects
of
state
law,
texas
law
almost
in
private.
that
perhaps
might
have
more
of
a
reason
the
court
felt
that,
that
we
were
trying
to
may
be
conspire
to
really
debate
on
the
question
that
they
shouldn't
have,
but
that
was
a
cornerstone
from
my
mind
but
being
asked
the
question
was
it
property
removed,
was
there
evidence
of
removal?
i
really
couldn't
find
the
evidence
of
removal
and
if
you
found
out
one
of
those,
you
can't
add
removability
to
a
case
by
what
the
answer
says
that
you
could
plead
a
constitutional
question
and
the
answer
--
and
you
do
not
give
federal
question
jurisdiction.
the
answer
just
–
is
doesn't
figure
in
determining
invisibility
and
that's
for
sure.
now
this
--
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
no
question.
it
came
up
completely
by
reason
of
--
if
we
were
to
start
in
the
federal
court,
we
as
a
new
york
corporation,
we
don't
deny
we
are
new
york
corporation,
we
are
sure
that
texas
(inaudible)
and
able
to
seek
$12,000
or
$10,000.
we
could
have
brought
it
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
well,
i
am
in
a
position
that
where
i
don't
believe
that
i
have
the
right
to
say
that
i
will
rollover
and
play
bid,
and
you
can
just
continue
on
the
jurisdiction.
i
don't
really
–
i
read
your
cases,
i
don't
think
i
have
a
right
to
fair
at
the
jurisdiction.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
no,
not
at
all.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
it's
for
tortuous
interference
in
the
business
definition.
it's
business
damage
from
connection
with
the
way
they
terminated
the
dealership
or
of
any
--
the
argument
was
that
this
tortuous
action
filed
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
he
could
have
known
–-
i
don't
think
he
could
have
filed
it
in
federal
court
because
he
was
the
resident,
oh,
yes
he
could
have
on
a
diversity
concept,
that's
true
but
he
simply
had
filed
--
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
that's
correct,
but
that
is
a
lawsuit,
that's
the
lawsuit,
they
need
to
file
themselves
and
they
brought
in
the
civil
court.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
possibly
so.
i
think
he
might
have
had
a
slightly
different
--
think
you
might
had
been
in
new
york.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
gecc
doesn't
operate
except
on
a
sale
position
and
may
be
on
the
long
run
we
might
have
been
able
to
get
it
there
but
i
believe
--
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
filed
it
in
the
state
court.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
that's
correct.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
well,
i
think
you
have
to
--
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
where
that
leads
you
is
to
the
fact
that
the
law
about
not
changing
the
nature
of
the
case
by
the
cross
action,
you're
going
to
have
to
change
some
of
that
law
if
you
arrive
at
that
conclusion.
because
it
was
a
responsive
cross
action
in
the
state
court,
and
it
does
not
change
the
--
it
did
not
let
the
case
removed,
as
such,
mr.
grubbs
would
not
have
removed
himself,
he
did
not
attempt
to
remove.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
well,
he
didn't
have
to
--
if
he
wanted
to
bring
his
tortuous
claim,
his
definition
suit,
he
would
not
require
to
bring,
he
is
not
a
compulsory
counter
claim,
he
could
have
brought
it.
(inaudible)
he
could
have
brought
it
in
whatever
form
he
wished
and
he
did
not
do.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
that's
correct.
it
was
sort
of
mixed
up
with
state
and
federal
but
i
think
that's
--
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
i
think
he
is
right.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
i
don't
know
what
ge's
position
is
in
the
matter.
there
has
been
no
appeal
by
the
government
or
by
them
or
anybody
else
with
respect
to
that,
they
may
have
the
judgment
that
is
depressive
and
can
be
sustained
to
collateral
attack
--
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
i
guess
too.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
no,
denied,
gecc.
i
guess
you
have
a
corporate
corporation
not
on
antitrust,
not
antitrust
--
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
it's
plain
money
judgment
and
the
damages
were
$20,000
–
they
saw
on
the
injury
to
its
business
from
deformation.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
against
general
electric
credit
corporation
that
furnished
the
credit
upon
which
he
operated
and
appliance
dealer
for
general
electric.
this
was
just
in
that
and
there
are
some
accounts
that
have
been
purchased,
some
installments,
those
have
been
been
purchased,
that
he
defaulted
and
then
he
had
been
put
in
the
form
of
note.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
there
is
no
question
that
it
brings
back
memories
of
charles
dickens
's
writings.
there's
no
question
about
that.
there
is
no
question
that
we
--
i
am
trying
to
point
out
that
i
think
that
court
of
appeals
was
viewing
it
i
think
from
what
we
give
him
the
view
it
were
and
i
did
not
except
this
question
to
be
developed
in
the
case
when
it
came
up.
i
couldn't
find
a
suitable
answer.
perhaps
the
answer
is
--
the
question
it
has
put
on
the
grounds
of
removal
maybe
twisted
me
off
a
little
bit.
but,
even
though
as
i
am
getting
it,
i
do
find
that
some
of
the
cases
are
highly
confusing
because
all
of
them
seem
to
have
--
for
instance
we
did
not
move
onto
trial
on
the
plea
when
we
filed
in
the
state
court.
it's
true,
we
did
some
actions
in
the
federal
court,
but
we
never
amended
our
petition,
the
first
provisionary
petition
was
the
only
petition.
that's
what
that's
cast
in
state
court
for
–-
that's
what
that
does
in
attempt
to
say
any
jurisdiction
evolves
in
the
federal
court,
it
would
just
not
in
any.
now
we
did
file
responsive
pleas
to
these
cross-actions
against
us.
we
had
some
in
the
state
court
and
in
the
federal
court,
well
for
the
first
time
the
united
states
government
took
the
(inaudible),
and
we
answered
and
sought
full
trails,
i
recall
those
answers
were
amended
to
bring
them
down
to
date
because
a
more
definite
statement
was
subsequently
filed.
but,
it
was
in
the
state
court
until
the
government
got
in
to
it.
now,
it's
just
as
simple
as
that,
the
government
probably
could
remove,
did
remove;
we
thought
they
could
remove
and
didn't
object.
i
think
that
it's
true
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
discuss
that
banks
case
and
those
cases
that
are
cited
--
the
uinta
case,
but
in
each
and
everyone
of
those
cases
that
i
could
see,
there
were
considerable
elements
of
amended
pleading
and
sort
of
a
new
ball
game
started
over
in
the
federal
court.
i
don't
know
why
that
court
of
appeals
didn't
ask
them.
i
saw
judge
goldberg
lost
that
day
i
wanted
to
ask
him
but
i
figured
may
i
better
--
i
may
have
to
ask
him
about
the
(inaudible)
case
someday.
thank
you
very
much.
