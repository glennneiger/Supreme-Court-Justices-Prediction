justice
potter
stewart
you
can't
really
say,
can
you
that
united
states
abandoned
it.
i
gather
they
litigated
on
the
merits
of
that
claim
and
then
decided
not
to
appeal.
justice
potter
stewart
at
that
time
the
united
states
removed
it
--
wasn't
it
a
proper
removal?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
lawsuit
in
which
there
is
a
judgment.
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
but
you
were
already
in
the
state
court,
as
a
party
and
he
filed
this
cross
action,
in
which
he
named
the
united
states
and
general
electric.
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
filed
it
in
the
state
court,
then
after
that
filed
--
that
was
what
was
pending
in
the
state
court
when
the
united
states
removed,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
pending
actually
a
suit
by
the
texas
resident
against
the
new
york
resident
and
that's
the
action,
and
the
cross
action
that
removed
this.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
one
of
his
claims
was
an
anti-trust
claim.
justice
potter
stewart
so
here
is
a
case
in
which
he
has
judgments
being
tried
out
in
the
federal
court
and
the
suggestion
is
that
you
start
all
over
and
try
it
out
again
on
the
same
court.
justice
potter
stewart
grubbs
had
a
judgment.
justice
potter
stewart
ge?
justice
potter
stewart
you
have
to
agree
this
was
--
it
makes
the
law
at
hand,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
let's
see.
it's
a
restriction
on
removability
then
however.
justice
potter
stewart
a
resident
defendant
cannot
remove.
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
chattel
mortgage?
justice
potter
stewart
you
can't
really
say,
can
you
that
united
states
abandoned
it.
