chief

warren
e.

mr.
cornelius,
on
the
face
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
at
the
outset
is
a
statement
that
they
find
the
complete
absence
of
federal
jurisdiction.
in
the
argument
of
the
court
of
appeals,
was
there
any
reference
to
the
first
paragraph
of
general
electric
company's
complaint
which
recites
diversity
facts
even
though,
they
are
not
directed
at
a
diversity
plain.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
assuming
that
there
was
no
diversity
either
alleged
as
there
was
in
paragraph
one,
or
no
diversity
of
substance.
in
fact
as
soon
as
the
united
states
was
brought
into
the
case,
and
the
basis
for
federal
jurisdiction,
did
the
court
discuss
that
in
the
oral
argument
at
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
it
argued
in
the
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
could
you
go
by
the
argument
to
the
main
argument
without
some
reference
to
this
diversity
and
some
reference
to
the
fact
that
the
united
states
had
become
a
party?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
responded
to
someone's
question
a
few
minutes
ago
that
there
was
no
objection
when
it
was
removed.
there
are
cases
holding
that,
that's
an
effective
waiver,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
bill
j.
cornelius.mr.
johnson?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
ask
you
this.
let's
assume
that
the
complaint
rather
inheartfully
(ph)
asserted
something
like
diversity
jurisdiction,
but
failed
as
justice
blackmun
said
to
state
it
as
it
should
be
stated.
then
let's
assume
that
the
claim
against
the
united
states
is
a
spurious
claim
and
that
there
is
no
bona
fide
basis
of
it
made
the
party
but
after
that
when
the
case
is
removed
with
no
objection
for
any
reason
and
that
is
against
the
background
of
complaint
which
alleges
facts
which
support
the
diversity
determination.

did
the
court
say
that
there
