ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
peters
is
in
the
extraordinary
position
of
asking
that
his
conviction
and
his
sentence
be
set
aside
and
his
indictment
voided
because
he
was
favored
by
the
jury
selection
system.
and
he
does
so
as
an
act
of
thought
after
his
second
trial
and
appeal
to
georgia
appellate
courts.
he
didn’t
raise
the
complaint
at
all
in
the
state
courts.
what
happened
actually
is
that
the
history
of
this
whole
case
is
a
piggyback
affair,
if
i
may
use
that
colloquialism.
he
wants
to
avoid
his
conviction
which
was
head
in
1966
by
claiming
the
rights
of
negroes
without
alleging
any
harm
to
him.
as
i
said,
he
never
complained
of
the
jury
composition
in
the
state
courts.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no,
i
am
not
because
we
did
not
take
a
course
appeal
from
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
that
he
did
not
have
to
exhaust.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no,
not
all.
although
while
the
positionings
that
we
took
in
the
district
court
and
that
we
thought
should
have
been
sustained
was
sustained
in
the
district
court
and
then
the
fifth
circuit
ruled
on
the
merits
of
the
claim
was
that
he
should
have
exhausted
his
state
remedies.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
we
certainly
are
but
since
we
did
not
take
a
course
appeal,
i
refer
that
more
or
less
of
the
peripheral
matter.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
we
think
that
there
is
a
more
fundamental
question
here
and
of
course,
we
have
brought
to
this
court
as
the
respondent
in
a
grand
petition
certiorari.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no,
sir.
i
don’t
think
that’s
necessarily
mr.
justice
white
because
i
think,
there
is
much
more
fundamental
issues
here
which
the
court
can
rule
on
and
which
was
ruled
on
at
that
the
district
court
level
and
by
the
fifth
circuit,
and
that
is
that
there
is
no
claim
stated
by
the
petitioner
upon
which
relief
can
be
granted
because
he
doesn’t
claim
a
federal
constitutional
right
which
is
violated.
he
is
claiming
somebody
else’s
right.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
for
the
purposes
of
this
appeal,
that’s
correct.
although,
the
reasons
that
they
said,
the
exhaustion
was
not
necessarily.
we
believe
were
wrong
because
we
don’t
think
that
he
is
foreclosed
by
the
state
courts
of
georgia.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
there
indeed,
there
should
be.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
we
do
not
think
that
there
was.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no,
sir,
only
an
answer
to
your
question.
we
don’t
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that’s
correct.
but
i
think
the
answer
that
was
given
in
going
to
the
merit
itself
is
what
this
court
can
rule
on
so
that
the
merit
does
not
need
to
come
up
again.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
indeed
you
could.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
oh!
not
at
all
because
i
think
the
very
basic,
the
fact
that
they
moved
down
to
the
question
and
so
did
the
district
court,
district
court
held
an
answer
to
our
motion
to
dismiss
which
was
on
three
bases.
the
second
one
being
that
he
had
not
exhausted
and
the
third
one
being
beyond
that
that
he
had
no
course
of
action,
the
district
court
held
in
conformating
with
the
position
taken
by
the
respondent
that
number
one,
he
did
not
exhaust
the
state
remedy
but
even
if
he
had,
there
is
not
course
of
action.
taking
the
view
that
even
if
he
had
gone
to
the
state
courts,
the
result
would
have
been
the
same
because
the
alleged
no
violation
of
a
federal
constitutional
right.
so,
it
foreclosed
the
necessity
of
going
back
and
forth
to
reach
the
same
result
when
it
could
be
reach
straight
in
the
district
court
here
without
a
hearing.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that
is
correct.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
mr.
justice.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that’s
correct.
right
and
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
we
are
saying
that’s
wrong
because
of
the
reasons
given
that
he
was
foreclosed
from
raising
the
issue
in
the
georgia
courts,
and
that
is
incorrect
as
a
matter
of
fact.
but,
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
when
you
get
down
to
the
course
of
action
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
very
fact
the
he
relied
so
heavily
on
the
exhaustion
as
giving
you
and
that’s
where
the
standing
issue
came
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
said
he
had
standing
because
he
had,
didn’t
have
to
exhaust.
he
had
a
justification
for
none
exhausting
so
he
had
standing
to
come
into
court,
and
that
is
how
that
issue
got
in.
although
of
course,
we
never
have
challenge
the
standing
to
raise
question.
what
we’re
saying
is
that
there
is
no
constitution
right
in
the
first
place
not
that
you’re
not
the
proper
place
to
raise
it.
but
i
think
the
fact,
the
exhaustion
question
is
important
because
it
illustrates
that
he
did
not
pursue
the
due
process
claim
in
the
courts
below,
and
this
is
the
answer
to
a
question
that
mr.
justice
white
asked
appellant’s
counsel
and
i
think
it
is
very
important
to
recognize
that
because
this
whole
thing
arose
us
an
equal
protection
claim.
the
petitioner
in
his
petition
in
the
court
--
in
the
district
court
talked
in
terms
of
systematic
exclusion
and
fourteenth
amendment
and
equal
protection
and
just
briefly
mentioned
the
words
due
process
and
we
do
not
think
that
that
raise
as
a
due
process
argument.
and
he
says,
i
do
not
have
to
go
to
the
georgia
supreme
court
because
they’ve
already
ruled
that
i
can’t
raise
the
systematic
exclusion
issue,
and
systematic
exclusion
has
always
been
regarded
as
an
equal
protection
concept.
this
court
said
so
and
why
this?
and
in
the
case
is
preceding
it.
it
is
in
the
terms
of
equal
protection
concept
that
we
looked
at
the
systematic
exclusion
allegation.
and
by
him,
now
coming
at
this
point
and
say,
well
now,
i
want
to
pursue
this
idea
of
due
process
which
i
just
mentioned
the
two
words
in
the
court
below
and
in
the
district
court,
i
don't
think
he
has
raised
that
properly
because
he
didn’t
argue
it
in
the
court
below
and
that’s
exactly
what
he
used
as
the
basis
for
not
going
through
the
georgia’s
state
courts.
so,
he
indicates
to
me
that
he
did
not
intent
to
raise
a
due
process
argument
because
he
there
states,
he
has
a
new
right
which
is
never
been
recognized
before
which
is
a
right
to
a
representative
cross-section
of
the
community
period.
he
eliminates
the
part
that
makes
it
a
equal
protection
claim
which
is
a
right
to
a
representative
cross-section
of
the
community
from
which
members
of
his
race
where
not
excluded.
and
that’s
the
concept
--
that's
the
context
in
which
that
phrase
has
been
used
in
all
the
cases
that
i
have
been
able
to
find
since
strauder.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
that
the
concept
arose
in
the
smith
case
in
1900
or
rather
1940.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
but
he
doesn't
tie
that
in
at
all.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
if
it
affects
the
fairness
of
his
trial.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
as
an
abstract
principle,
i
think
that
is
correct.
but
i
think
for
him
to
assert
that
and
say
that
his
trial
should
be
avoided
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
it
may
very
well
be
so,
if
he
didn’t
affect
his
case.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
it
would
not
be
under
the
statutory
scheme.
nor
would
it
be
correct
as
a
system
the
constitutional
scheme.
i
am
talking
about
the
constitution
scheme.
mr.
justice
marshall
that
would
not
be
correct
in
terms
of
constitutional
requirement.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
but
it
would
not
affect
him.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
sir.
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart,
it
would
be.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
which
gets
to,
i
think
to
the
point
that
you
were
making
in
your
questioning
as
the
appellant’s
counsel,
petitioner’s
counsel
that
he
could
not
be
representing
the
interest
of
anybody
else.
in
the
posture
of
this
case
because
this
is
a
habeas
corpus
case
in
which
he
is
saying
my
conviction
and
my
indictment
are
bad
and
i
am
looking
for
relief
to
myself
because
i
can
have
an
impartial
jury.
and
he
specifically
said
here
that
that’s
what
he
is
relying
on
as
the
sixth
amendment
right
forwarding
to
the
due
process
course.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no,
i
do
not
think
so.
i
think
it
is
much
more
fundamental
than
that.
if
it
were
a
standing
case,
then
i
think
we
might
be
in
position
to
say
that
the
right
that
belongs
to
somebody,
but
he
is
not
the
right
person
to
come
forward
and
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
the
right
which
he
is
talking
about
here
which
is
the
right
not
to
have
negroes
excluded.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
right.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
sir.
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart
and
it
belongs
to
those
who
would
be
deprived
of
a
right
thereby,
or
who
would
be
discriminated
against
thereby.
the
right
to
serve
on
juries.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that’s
also
carter.
but
that
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that’s
right!
because
we
presumed
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
we
have
presumed
that
there
is
prejudice
against
the
black
man
if
member
of
his
race
are
excluded
from
the
jury
selection
system,
and
that
he
is
thereby
discriminating
against
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
as
to
him?
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
it
is
not
a
void
jury.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
but
he
is
the
only
one
that
can
raise
the
point
because
the
constitutional
claims
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no,
sir.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
don’t.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
think
i
would
because
you
get
so
close,
and
i
think
this
court
has
said
so
and
at
least
one
or
two
cases
that
equal
protection
knows
what
due
process
when
you
taught
them
here.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
all
right.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
think
that
he
would
indeed
be
sustained
for
this
reason.
if
he
is
claiming
due
process
has
been
denied
to
him,
it
means
he
has
suffered
some
harm,
he
has
not
had
a
fair
trial
as
the
concept,
and
he
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
if
what
he
was
saying
was
that
he
was
denied
a
fair
trial,
that
he
was
denied
an
impartial
jury,
because
negroes
where
systematically
excluded,
people
of
his
own
race
were
systematically
excluded,
then
yes,
he
would
have
to
sustain
it
because
it
did
not
have
an
impartial
jury.
we
presumed
the
prejudice
in
those
cases.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
either
it
has
to
be
something
that
we
have
presumed
which
we
have
done
and
i
do
not
want
to
belabor
the
point
presumes
but
we
presumed
that
in
the
case
of
exclusion
of
race.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
sir.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
but
there
again,
you’re
talking
about
harm
and
you’re
talking
about
prejudice
which
this
man
here
does
not
claim.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
you
go
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
we
don’t
know.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
oh,
yes
indeed.
but
and
if
he
claims
some
affinity
or
some
identity
with
those
who
were
excluded
or
for
some
reason,
things
that
the
exclusion
of
those
are
going
to
affect
his
case,
then
he
would
be
in
the
position
to
claim
it.
but
to
just
take
the
concept
out
of
the
air
and
say
that
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
but
i
would
ask
that
that
position
of
course
being
maintained
again
in
this
case
and
the
court
i
think
you
mentioned
mr.
justice
douglas,
ballard
and
of
course
those
cases
are
in
opposite
because
those
are
on
the
basis
of
the
supervisory
power
of
the
court
and
the
court
does
not
look
into
whether
there
is
prejudice
or
not
because
congress
has
laid
down
the
policy.
i
think
that’s
one
of
the
points
that
was
made
in
fay
that
when
you
are
talking
about
a
constitutional
right,
that
is
a
distinction
as
to
when
you
are
claiming
a
statutory
violation.
if
it
is
a
statutory
violation,
there’s
no
question
as
to
whether
there
is
harm
or
not
that’s
already
been
decided.
whereas,
if
you
are
talking
about
a
lack
of
due
process
or
equal
protection,
then
you
must
show
some
harm.
and
i
think
one
of
the
best
analogies
that
i
came
across
was
the
decision
in
witherspoon
and
particularly
since
it
was
followed
by
the
bumper
case
of
the
same
day.
there
was
also
a
procedure
which
it
was
found,
a
part
of
criminal
proceedings
which
were
found
to
be
in
violation
of
the
constitution.
and
that
was
the
questioning
that
was
used
in
death
penalty
cases
or
at
least
capital
felony
cases
when
the
death
penalty
was
a
possibility,
and
it
was
found
out
question
that
made
the
jury
prone
towards
giving
a
death
penalty.
but
the
court
did
go
so
far
as
to
say,
therefore,
we
are
going
to
eliminate
his
whole
conviction
because
there
was
no
connection
between
the
questioning
which
had
to
do
with
the
sentence
and
the
conviction,
the
concept
of
guilt
or
innocence.
so
since
he
could
not
show
any
harm
even
though
this
was
an
unconstitutional
questioning
system
that
was
being
used,
since
it
did
not
affect
him,
we’re
not
going
to
overturn
his
conviction,
and
that
happens
specifically
in
the
bumper
case
where
although
the
questions
where
used,
he
had
got
a
life
imprisonment.
so
it
didn’t
matter
to
him.
it
didn’t
affect
him
those
improper
unconstitutional,
lack
of
due
process
kind
of
questions
because
it
did
not
affect
him
since
he
wasn’t,
it
didn’t
ultimately
get
it.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
not
at
all.
i
think,
he
is
certainly
is
entitled
to
a
fair
trial.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
i
think
that
is
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
but
what
he
is
claiming
here
and
it
was
indicated
not
only
in
the
brief
below,
but
also
on
oral
argument
and
he
is
claiming
that
he
was
denied
due
process
because
of
the
sixth
amendment
right.
sixth
amendment
right
talks
about
an
impartial
jury
and
he
doesn’t
say
he
had
an
impartial
jury.
moreover,
if
you
follow
the
theory
that
there
is
presumed
prejudice
if
negroes
are
excluded,
the
prejudice
going
against
a
negro,
then
there
must
be
on
a
conversed
favor
towards
the
white
man,
if
negroes
are
excluded.
so,
here
he
is
in
a
position
saying,
i
was
denied
due
process,
but
i
really
wasn’t
denied
an
impartial
jury.
i
was
given
a
favored
jury
in
my
circumstances.
he
doesn’t
show
anything
that
would
affect
the
impartiality
of
his
own
jury.
and
again,
the
question
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
was
raised
on
the
petition
to
certiorari,
that
only
with
the
grand
jury
whereas
the
brief
expand
it
to
include
the
petit
jury
and
i
thought
that
the
grant
of
the
petition
limited
to
the
grand
jury
which
request
mostly
even
more.
i
think
it
would
because
a
grand
jury
may
not
have
even
been
aware
of
his
color
whereas
the
trial
jury
might.
so
the
nature
of
what
a
grand
jury’s
duties
are,
really
have
nothing
to
do
with
what
the
nature
duties
on
the
trial
jury
and
all
they
do
is
refer
the
charge.
and
in
this
particular
case,
in
fact
in
this
case
you
know,
he
never
complain
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no,
i
think
not
because
again,
we
say
that
in
order
to
reach
or
to
have
an
impartial
jury
and
to
have
a
fair
jury
system
in
selection,
we
must
not
exclude
negroes
in
order
so
that
negroes
themselves
will
not
be
discriminated
against.
but
i
think
he
has
gone
too
far
in
saying
that
we
will
presume
a
prejudice
here.
he
has
not
suggested
where
it
arise
from
i
would
suggest
that
there
is
no
harm
in
this
case.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
but
that’s
not
the
right
that
is
being
asserted
here.
the
right
that’s
being
asserted
here
is
his
own
personal
right.
peters’
own
personal
right
as
it
affected
him.
he
is
saying
that
he
was
denied
due
process,
not
to
be
brought
in
the
community
who
weren’t
represented
on
the
jury.
so
i
do
not
think
that
it’s
particularly
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that’s
what
he
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
well,
that
may
very
well
be
in
since
that
the
system
should
be
change.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
right
after
the
white’s
decision
came
down
in
1967.
and
now
the
statute
does,
the
georgia
statute
does
call
for
a
representative
cross-section.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
and
i
think
he
has
none.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
think
not.
he
doesn’t
claim
it
here
in
the
first
place
and
i
don’t
think
(voice
overlap)
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
in
his
trial?
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
not
in
all
the
trials
in
the
county.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
but
the
question
is
and
i
think
this
court’s
decisions
with
respect
to
jury
discrimination
show
this
neither
the
jury
discrimination
but
other
due
process
types
of
thing
that
it’s
harm
to
him.
[voice
overlap]
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
it
has
been
a
personal
right
before
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
which
is
somebody
else’s
right
and
he
has
no
standing?
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
indeed
mr.
justice
stewart.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
indeed.
he
is
attacking
the
system
and
that
is
what
he
would
have
to
do
if
he
had
raised
it
properly
at
the
time
and
introduced
this
evidence
to
show
that
there
was
systematic
exclusion,
perhaps.
but
he
doesn’t
have
a
claim
here
because
he
doesn’t
tie
himself
into
a
denial
of
any
right
that
he
has.
the
cross-section
concept
has
always
been
in
terms
of
the
equal
protection
cases
and
used
in
that
where
somebody
has
been
excluded
and
the
person
who
has
been
tried
to
spent
a
member
of
that
excluded
group.
and
so
it’s
the
harm
flowing
to
him.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
but
those
were
the
people
who
were
excluded
from
serving
on
the
juries.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
indeed
but
i
do
not
think
and
again,
i
will
give
you
another
analogy
that
merely
showing
that
there
has
been
something
wrong
in
the
system
can
be
sufficient
to
overturn
the
conviction
of
the
person
who
says
he
has
been
denied
due
process.
he
has
been
denied
due
process.
the
court
says
that
he
has
been
deprived
whether
he
has
been
deprived
of
his
liberty
without
due
process
of
law,
not
somebody
else.
the
second
analogy
i
would
like
to
present
other
than
the
witherspoon
case
would
be
the
very
recent
case
is
following
u.s.
versus
jackson.
and
i
point
particularly
to
brady
where
although
the
statute
was
declared
to
be
unconstitutional
in
jackson,
in
brady,
the
court
said
it
didn’t
matter
in
his
case
eventhough
the
death
penalty
and
jury
tie
in
under
the
kidnapping
statute
in
jackson
was
used
and
was
involved
in
brady’s
case.
still,
it
didn’t
affect
his
plea.
and
therefore,
we
are
not
going
to
overturn
his
plea
because
it
didn’t
--
the
use
of
the
statute
in
that
case
didn’t
harm
him.
and
i
think
that
we
have
exactly
the
same
situation
here.
i
think
it’s
also
important
to
recognize
that
in
the
cases
that
are
cited
by
the
appellant
which
have
talked
about
an
absolute
right
to
a
cross
section
of
the
community
period
without
talking
about
exclusion
of
members
of
your
own
race
that
the
rationale
in
those
cases
doesn’t
answer
the
question
why
should
you
have
this
cross
section
of
community
period.
and
i
think,
that’s
where
they
fall
short.
if
we
talked
about
whether
there
should
be
a
cross
section,
the
idea
is
to
make
sure
that
we
have
an
impartial
jury
and
that
we
have
a
fair
criminal
proceeding.
now,
if
we
do
have
a
fair
criminal
proceeding
with
respect
to
peters,
then
again,
there
is
no
denial
of
due
process.
and
it
seems
to
me
in
the
leading
the
cross-section
cases
that
that
really
is
a
measuring
device
and
not
a
subsentive
light
because
he
has
a
right
to
a
cross
section
of
the
community,
not
to
a
proportion
representation
or
not
with
trial
by
members
solely
of
his
race.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
thank
you.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
wanted
to
address
the
question
and
discussion
that
we
had
with
mr.
justice
stewart
with
regard
to
the
strauder
case.
i
think,
there
is
vast
distinction
here
because
this
arises
under
the
federal
habeas
corpus
act
and
under
the
theory
of
federal
habeas
corpus
or
habeas
corpus
generally,
a
person
would
be
challenging
his
own
conviction
and
saying
that
he
was
denied
his
own
constitutional
rights
by
virtue
of
something
that
happened
that
his
trial
or
afterwards
whereas
strauder
of
course
being
the
removal
statute
case
involved
something
else
entirely
in
its
context.
moreover,
strauder
too
was
negro
in
that
case
and
the
opinion
does
talk
to
a
great
extent
about
prejudice
that
devolved
to
him
which
we
don’t
have
in
this
case
at
all.
he
is
not
--
peters
is
not
a
person
aggrieved
by
what
he
claims
was
not
proper
in
that
sense.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
it
would
be
then
an
abstract
principle
which
has
not
been
held
for
the
application
of
constitutional
rights
to
others
in
other
context
i
think.
and
i
think
an
answer
to
that
i
would
quote
from
the
fay
case
which
mr.
justice
douglas
mentioned
in
1947.
“the
defendants
have
shown
no
intentional
and
purposeful
exclusion
of
any
class,
and
they
have
shown
none
that
was
prejudicial
to
them.
they
had
had
a
fair
trial
and
no
reason
appears
why
they
should
escape
its
results.
to
reverse
the
judgment
free
from
intrinsic
infirmity
and
perhaps
to
put
in
question
other
judgments
based
on
verdicts
that
resulted
from
the
same
method
of
selecting
juries
reminds
too
much
of
burning
the
bond
or
to
roast
the
pig.”
and
i
think
we
have
that
same
situation
here.
as
in
fay
so
in
peters,
the
challenge
to
this
judgment
under
the
due
process
clause
must
stand
a
fall
on
a
showing
that
these
defendants
have
had
a
trial
so
unfair
as
to
amount
to
a
taking
of
their
liberty
without
due
process
of
law.
and
i
think
on
this
record,
we
would
find
that
he
does
not
allege
anything
more
than
that
he
was
a
white
person.
he
doesn’t
allege
any
affinity
or
identification
with
those
who
are
excluded.
he
is
not
a
member
of
class.
he
doesn’t
allege
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
class
or
was
harmed,
and
therefore,
i
think
that
his
judgment
should
not
be
overturned.
thank
you.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
peters
is
in
the
extraordinary
position
of
asking
that
his
conviction
and
his
sentence
be
set
aside
and
his
indictment
voided
because
he
was
favored
by
the
jury
selection
system.
and
he
does
so
as
an
act
of
thought
after
his
second
trial
and
appeal
to
georgia
appellate
courts.
he
didn’t
raise
the
complaint
at
all
in
the
state
courts.
what
happened
actually
is
that
the
history
of
this
whole
case
is
a
piggyback
affair,
if
i
may
use
that
colloquialism.
he
wants
to
avoid
his
conviction
which
was
head
in
1966
by
claiming
the
rights
of
negroes
without
alleging
any
harm
to
him.
as
i
said,
he
never
complained
of
the
jury
composition
in
the
state
courts.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no,
i
am
not
because
we
did
not
take
a
course
appeal
from
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
that
he
did
not
have
to
exhaust.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no,
not
all.
although
while
the
positionings
that
we
took
in
the
district
court
and
that
we
thought
should
have
been
sustained
was
sustained
in
the
district
court
and
then
the
fifth
circuit
ruled
on
the
merits
of
the
claim
was
that
he
should
have
exhausted
his
state
remedies.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
we
certainly
are
but
since
we
did
not
take
a
course
appeal,
i
refer
that
more
or
less
of
the
peripheral
matter.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
we
think
that
there
is
a
more
fundamental
question
here
and
of
course,
we
have
brought
to
this
court
as
the
respondent
in
a
grand
petition
certiorari.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no,
sir.
i
don’t
think
that’s
necessarily
mr.
justice
white
because
i
think,
there
is
much
more
fundamental
issues
here
which
the
court
can
rule
on
and
which
was
ruled
on
at
that
the
district
court
level
and
by
the
fifth
circuit,
and
that
is
that
there
is
no
claim
stated
by
the
petitioner
upon
which
relief
can
be
granted
because
he
doesn’t
claim
a
federal
constitutional
right
which
is
violated.
he
is
claiming
somebody
else’s
right.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
for
the
purposes
of
this
appeal,
that’s
correct.
although,
the
reasons
that
they
said,
the
exhaustion
was
not
necessarily.
we
believe
were
wrong
because
we
don’t
think
that
he
is
foreclosed
by
the
state
courts
of
georgia.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
there
indeed,
there
should
be.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
we
do
not
think
that
there
was.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no,
sir,
only
an
answer
to
your
question.
we
don’t
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that’s
correct.
but
i
think
the
answer
that
was
given
in
going
to
the
merit
itself
is
what
this
court
can
rule
on
so
that
the
merit
does
not
need
to
come
up
again.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
indeed
you
could.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
oh!
not
at
all
because
i
think
the
very
basic,
the
fact
that
they
moved
down
to
the
question
and
so
did
the
district
court,
district
court
held
an
answer
to
our
motion
to
dismiss
which
was
on
three
bases.
the
second
one
being
that
he
had
not
exhausted
and
the
third
one
being
beyond
that
that
he
had
no
course
of
action,
the
district
court
held
in
conformating
with
the
position
taken
by
the
respondent
that
number
one,
he
did
not
exhaust
the
state
remedy
but
even
if
he
had,
there
is
not
course
of
action.
taking
the
view
that
even
if
he
had
gone
to
the
state
courts,
the
result
would
have
been
the
same
because
the
alleged
no
violation
of
a
federal
constitutional
right.
so,
it
foreclosed
the
necessity
of
going
back
and
forth
to
reach
the
same
result
when
it
could
be
reach
straight
in
the
district
court
here
without
a
hearing.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that
is
correct.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
mr.
justice.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that’s
correct.
right
and
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
we
are
saying
that’s
wrong
because
of
the
reasons
given
that
he
was
foreclosed
from
raising
the
issue
in
the
georgia
courts,
and
that
is
incorrect
as
a
matter
of
fact.
but,
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
when
you
get
down
to
the
course
of
action
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
very
fact
the
he
relied
so
heavily
on
the
exhaustion
as
giving
you
and
that’s
where
the
standing
issue
came
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
said
he
had
standing
because
he
had,
didn’t
have
to
exhaust.
he
had
a
justification
for
none
exhausting
so
he
had
standing
to
come
into
court,
and
that
is
how
that
issue
got
in.
although
of
course,
we
never
have
challenge
the
standing
to
raise
question.
what
we’re
saying
is
that
there
is
no
constitution
right
in
the
first
place
not
that
you’re
not
the
proper
place
to
raise
it.
but
i
think
the
fact,
the
exhaustion
question
is
important
because
it
illustrates
that
he
did
not
pursue
the
due
process
claim
in
the
courts
below,
and
this
is
the
answer
to
a
question
that
mr.
justice
white
asked
appellant’s
counsel
and
i
think
it
is
very
important
to
recognize
that
because
this
whole
thing
arose
us
an
equal
protection
claim.
the
petitioner
in
his
petition
in
the
court
--
in
the
district
court
talked
in
terms
of
systematic
exclusion
and
fourteenth
amendment
and
equal
protection
and
just
briefly
mentioned
the
words
due
process
and
we
do
not
think
that
that
raise
as
a
due
process
argument.
and
he
says,
i
do
not
have
to
go
to
the
georgia
supreme
court
because
they’ve
already
ruled
that
i
can’t
raise
the
systematic
exclusion
issue,
and
systematic
exclusion
has
always
been
regarded
as
an
equal
protection
concept.
this
court
said
so
and
why
this?
and
in
the
case
is
preceding
it.
it
is
in
the
terms
of
equal
protection
concept
that
we
looked
at
the
systematic
exclusion
allegation.
and
by
him,
now
coming
at
this
point
and
say,
well
now,
i
want
to
pursue
this
idea
of
due
process
which
i
just
mentioned
the
two
words
in
the
court
below
and
in
the
district
court,
i
don't
think
he
has
raised
that
properly
because
he
didn’t
argue
it
in
the
court
below
and
that’s
exactly
what
he
used
as
the
basis
for
not
going
through
the
georgia’s
state
courts.
so,
he
indicates
to
me
that
he
did
not
intent
to
raise
a
due
process
argument
because
he
there
states,
he
has
a
new
right
which
is
never
been
recognized
before
which
is
a
right
to
a
representative
cross-section
of
the
community
period.
he
eliminates
the
part
that
makes
it
a
equal
protection
claim
which
is
a
right
to
a
representative
cross-section
of
the
community
from
which
members
of
his
race
where
not
excluded.
and
that’s
the
concept
--
that's
the
context
in
which
that
phrase
has
been
used
in
all
the
cases
that
i
have
been
able
to
find
since
strauder.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
that
the
concept
arose
in
the
smith
case
in
1900
or
rather
1940.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
but
he
doesn't
tie
that
in
at
all.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
if
it
affects
the
fairness
of
his
trial.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
as
an
abstract
principle,
i
think
that
is
correct.
but
i
think
for
him
to
assert
that
and
say
that
his
trial
should
be
avoided
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
it
may
very
well
be
so,
if
he
didn’t
affect
his
case.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
it
would
not
be
under
the
statutory
scheme.
nor
would
it
be
correct
as
a
system
the
constitutional
scheme.
i
am
talking
about
the
constitution
scheme.
mr.
justice
marshall
that
would
not
be
correct
in
terms
of
constitutional
requirement.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
but
it
would
not
affect
him.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
sir.
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart,
it
would
be.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
which
gets
to,
i
think
to
the
point
that
you
were
making
in
your
questioning
as
the
appellant’s
counsel,
petitioner’s
counsel
that
he
could
not
be
representing
the
interest
of
anybody
else.
in
the
posture
of
this
case
because
this
is
a
habeas
corpus
case
in
which
he
is
saying
my
conviction
and
my
indictment
are
bad
and
i
am
looking
for
relief
to
myself
because
i
can
have
an
impartial
jury.
and
he
specifically
said
here
that
that’s
what
he
is
relying
on
as
the
sixth
amendment
right
forwarding
to
the
due
process
course.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no,
i
do
not
think
so.
i
think
it
is
much
more
fundamental
than
that.
if
it
were
a
standing
case,
then
i
think
we
might
be
in
position
to
say
that
the
right
that
belongs
to
somebody,
but
he
is
not
the
right
person
to
come
forward
and
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
the
right
which
he
is
talking
about
here
which
is
the
right
not
to
have
negroes
excluded.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
right.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
sir.
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart
and
it
belongs
to
those
who
would
be
deprived
of
a
right
thereby,
or
who
would
be
discriminated
against
thereby.
the
right
to
serve
on
juries.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that’s
also
carter.
but
that
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that’s
right!
because
we
presumed
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
we
have
presumed
that
there
is
prejudice
against
the
black
man
if
member
of
his
race
are
excluded
from
the
jury
selection
system,
and
that
he
is
thereby
discriminating
against
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
as
to
him?
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
it
is
not
a
void
jury.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
but
he
is
the
only
one
that
can
raise
the
point
because
the
constitutional
claims
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no,
sir.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
don’t.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
think
i
would
because
you
get
so
close,
and
i
think
this
court
has
said
so
and
at
least
one
or
two
cases
that
equal
protection
knows
what
due
process
when
you
taught
them
here.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
all
right.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
think
that
he
would
indeed
be
sustained
for
this
reason.
if
he
is
claiming
due
process
has
been
denied
to
him,
it
means
he
has
suffered
some
harm,
he
has
not
had
a
fair
trial
as
the
concept,
and
he
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
if
what
he
was
saying
was
that
he
was
denied
a
fair
trial,
that
he
was
denied
an
impartial
jury,
because
negroes
where
systematically
excluded,
people
of
his
own
race
were
systematically
excluded,
then
yes,
he
would
have
to
sustain
it
because
it
did
not
have
an
impartial
jury.
we
presumed
the
prejudice
in
those
cases.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
either
it
has
to
be
something
that
we
have
presumed
which
we
have
done
and
i
do
not
want
to
belabor
the
point
presumes
but
we
presumed
that
in
the
case
of
exclusion
of
race.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
sir.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
but
there
again,
you’re
talking
about
harm
and
you’re
talking
about
prejudice
which
this
man
here
does
not
claim.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
you
go
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
we
don’t
know.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
oh,
yes
indeed.
but
and
if
he
claims
some
affinity
or
some
identity
with
those
who
were
excluded
or
for
some
reason,
things
that
the
exclusion
of
those
are
going
to
affect
his
case,
then
he
would
be
in
the
position
to
claim
it.
but
to
just
take
the
concept
out
of
the
air
and
say
that
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
but
i
would
ask
that
that
position
of
course
being
maintained
again
in
this
case
and
the
court
i
think
you
mentioned
mr.
justice
douglas,
ballard
and
of
course
those
cases
are
in
opposite
because
those
are
on
the
basis
of
the
supervisory
power
of
the
court
and
the
court
does
not
look
into
whether
there
is
prejudice
or
not
because
congress
has
laid
down
the
policy.
i
think
that’s
one
of
the
points
that
was
made
in
fay
that
when
you
are
talking
about
a
constitutional
right,
that
is
a
distinction
as
to
when
you
are
claiming
a
statutory
violation.
if
it
is
a
statutory
violation,
there’s
no
question
as
to
whether
there
is
harm
or
not
that’s
already
been
decided.
whereas,
if
you
are
talking
about
a
lack
of
due
process
or
equal
protection,
then
you
must
show
some
harm.
and
i
think
one
of
the
best
analogies
that
i
came
across
was
the
decision
in
witherspoon
and
particularly
since
it
was
followed
by
the
bumper
case
of
the
same
day.
there
was
also
a
procedure
which
it
was
found,
a
part
of
criminal
proceedings
which
were
found
to
be
in
violation
of
the
constitution.
and
that
was
the
questioning
that
was
used
in
death
penalty
cases
or
at
least
capital
felony
cases
when
the
death
penalty
was
a
possibility,
and
it
was
found
out
question
that
made
the
jury
prone
towards
giving
a
death
penalty.
but
the
court
did
go
so
far
as
to
say,
therefore,
we
are
going
to
eliminate
his
whole
conviction
because
there
was
no
connection
between
the
questioning
which
had
to
do
with
the
sentence
and
the
conviction,
the
concept
of
guilt
or
innocence.
so
since
he
could
not
show
any
harm
even
though
this
was
an
unconstitutional
questioning
system
that
was
being
used,
since
it
did
not
affect
him,
we’re
not
going
to
overturn
his
conviction,
and
that
happens
specifically
in
the
bumper
case
where
although
the
questions
where
used,
he
had
got
a
life
imprisonment.
so
it
didn’t
matter
to
him.
it
didn’t
affect
him
those
improper
unconstitutional,
lack
of
due
process
kind
of
questions
because
it
did
not
affect
him
since
he
wasn’t,
it
didn’t
ultimately
get
it.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
not
at
all.
i
think,
he
is
certainly
is
entitled
to
a
fair
trial.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
i
think
that
is
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
but
what
he
is
claiming
here
and
it
was
indicated
not
only
in
the
brief
below,
but
also
on
oral
argument
and
he
is
claiming
that
he
was
denied
due
process
because
of
the
sixth
amendment
right.
sixth
amendment
right
talks
about
an
impartial
jury
and
he
doesn’t
say
he
had
an
impartial
jury.
moreover,
if
you
follow
the
theory
that
there
is
presumed
prejudice
if
negroes
are
excluded,
the
prejudice
going
against
a
negro,
then
there
must
be
on
a
conversed
favor
towards
the
white
man,
if
negroes
are
excluded.
so,
here
he
is
in
a
position
saying,
i
was
denied
due
process,
but
i
really
wasn’t
denied
an
impartial
jury.
i
was
given
a
favored
jury
in
my
circumstances.
he
doesn’t
show
anything
that
would
affect
the
impartiality
of
his
own
jury.
and
again,
the
question
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
was
raised
on
the
petition
to
certiorari,
that
only
with
the
grand
jury
whereas
the
brief
expand
it
to
include
the
petit
jury
and
i
thought
that
the
grant
of
the
petition
limited
to
the
grand
jury
which
request
mostly
even
more.
i
think
it
would
because
a
grand
jury
may
not
have
even
been
aware
of
his
color
whereas
the
trial
jury
might.
so
the
nature
of
what
a
grand
jury’s
duties
are,
really
have
nothing
to
do
with
what
the
nature
duties
on
the
trial
jury
and
all
they
do
is
refer
the
charge.
and
in
this
particular
case,
in
fact
in
this
case
you
know,
he
never
complain
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no,
i
think
not
because
again,
we
say
that
in
order
to
reach
or
to
have
an
impartial
jury
and
to
have
a
fair
jury
system
in
selection,
we
must
not
exclude
negroes
in
order
so
that
negroes
themselves
will
not
be
discriminated
against.
but
i
think
he
has
gone
too
far
in
saying
that
we
will
presume
a
prejudice
here.
he
has
not
suggested
where
it
arise
from
i
would
suggest
that
there
is
no
harm
in
this
case.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
but
that’s
not
the
right
that
is
being
asserted
here.
the
right
that’s
being
asserted
here
is
his
own
personal
right.
peters’
own
personal
right
as
it
affected
him.
he
is
saying
that
he
was
denied
due
process,
not
to
be
brought
in
the
community
who
weren’t
represented
on
the
jury.
so
i
do
not
think
that
it’s
particularly
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that’s
what
he
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
well,
that
may
very
well
be
in
since
that
the
system
should
be
change.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
right
after
the
white’s
decision
came
down
in
1967.
and
now
the
statute
does,
the
georgia
statute
does
call
for
a
representative
cross-section.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
and
i
think
he
has
none.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
think
not.
he
doesn’t
claim
it
here
in
the
first
place
and
i
don’t
think
(voice
overlap)
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
in
his
trial?
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
not
in
all
the
trials
in
the
county.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
but
the
question
is
and
i
think
this
court’s
decisions
with
respect
to
jury
discrimination
show
this
neither
the
jury
discrimination
but
other
due
process
types
of
thing
that
it’s
harm
to
him.
[voice
overlap]
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
it
has
been
a
personal
right
before
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
which
is
somebody
else’s
right
and
he
has
no
standing?
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
indeed
mr.
justice
stewart.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
indeed.
he
is
attacking
the
system
and
that
is
what
he
would
have
to
do
if
he
had
raised
it
properly
at
the
time
and
introduced
this
evidence
to
show
that
there
was
systematic
exclusion,
perhaps.
but
he
doesn’t
have
a
claim
here
because
he
doesn’t
tie
himself
into
a
denial
of
any
right
that
he
has.
the
cross-section
concept
has
always
been
in
terms
of
the
equal
protection
cases
and
used
in
that
where
somebody
has
been
excluded
and
the
person
who
has
been
tried
to
spent
a
member
of
that
excluded
group.
and
so
it’s
the
harm
flowing
to
him.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
but
those
were
the
people
who
were
excluded
from
serving
on
the
juries.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
indeed
but
i
do
not
think
and
again,
i
will
give
you
another
analogy
that
merely
showing
that
there
has
been
something
wrong
in
the
system
can
be
sufficient
to
overturn
the
conviction
of
the
person
who
says
he
has
been
denied
due
process.
he
has
been
denied
due
process.
the
court
says
that
he
has
been
deprived
whether
he
has
been
deprived
of
his
liberty
without
due
process
of
law,
not
somebody
else.
the
second
analogy
i
would
like
to
present
other
than
the
witherspoon
case
would
be
the
very
recent
case
is
following
u.s.
versus
jackson.
and
i
point
particularly
to
brady
where
although
the
statute
was
declared
to
be
unconstitutional
in
jackson,
in
brady,
the
court
said
it
didn’t
matter
in
his
case
eventhough
the
death
penalty
and
jury
tie
in
under
the
kidnapping
statute
in
jackson
was
used
and
was
involved
in
brady’s
case.
still,
it
didn’t
affect
his
plea.
and
therefore,
we
are
not
going
to
overturn
his
plea
because
it
didn’t
--
the
use
of
the
statute
in
that
case
didn’t
harm
him.
and
i
think
that
we
have
exactly
the
same
situation
here.
i
think
it’s
also
important
to
recognize
that
in
the
cases
that
are
cited
by
the
appellant
which
have
talked
about
an
absolute
right
to
a
cross
section
of
the
community
period
without
talking
about
exclusion
of
members
of
your
own
race
that
the
rationale
in
those
cases
doesn’t
answer
the
question
why
should
you
have
this
cross
section
of
community
period.
and
i
think,
that’s
where
they
fall
short.
if
we
talked
about
whether
there
should
be
a
cross
section,
the
idea
is
to
make
sure
that
we
have
an
impartial
jury
and
that
we
have
a
fair
criminal
proceeding.
now,
if
we
do
have
a
fair
criminal
proceeding
with
respect
to
peters,
then
again,
there
is
no
denial
of
due
process.
and
it
seems
to
me
in
the
leading
the
cross-section
cases
that
that
really
is
a
measuring
device
and
not
a
subsentive
light
because
he
has
a
right
to
a
cross
section
of
the
community,
not
to
a
proportion
representation
or
not
with
trial
by
members
solely
of
his
race.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
thank
you.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
wanted
to
address
the
question
and
discussion
that
we
had
with
mr.
justice
stewart
with
regard
to
the
strauder
case.
i
think,
there
is
vast
distinction
here
because
this
arises
under
the
federal
habeas
corpus
act
and
under
the
theory
of
federal
habeas
corpus
or
habeas
corpus
generally,
a
person
would
be
challenging
his
own
conviction
and
saying
that
he
was
denied
his
own
constitutional
rights
by
virtue
of
something
that
happened
that
his
trial
or
afterwards
whereas
strauder
of
course
being
the
removal
statute
case
involved
something
else
entirely
in
its
context.
moreover,
strauder
too
was
negro
in
that
case
and
the
opinion
does
talk
to
a
great
extent
about
prejudice
that
devolved
to
him
which
we
don’t
have
in
this
case
at
all.
he
is
not
--
peters
is
not
a
person
aggrieved
by
what
he
claims
was
not
proper
in
that
sense.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
it
would
be
then
an
abstract
principle
which
has
not
been
held
for
the
application
of
constitutional
rights
to
others
in
other
context
i
think.
and
i
think
an
answer
to
that
i
would
quote
from
the
fay
case
which
mr.
justice
douglas
mentioned
in
1947.
“the
defendants
have
shown
no
intentional
and
purposeful
exclusion
of
any
class,
and
they
have
shown
none
that
was
prejudicial
to
them.
they
had
had
a
fair
trial
and
no
reason
appears
why
they
should
escape
its
results.
to
reverse
the
judgment
free
from
intrinsic
infirmity
and
perhaps
to
put
in
question
other
judgments
based
on
verdicts
that
resulted
from
the
same
method
of
selecting
juries
reminds
too
much
of
burning
the
bond
or
to
roast
the
pig.”
and
i
think
we
have
that
same
situation
here.
as
in
fay
so
in
peters,
the
challenge
to
this
judgment
under
the
due
process
clause
must
stand
a
fall
on
a
showing
that
these
defendants
have
had
a
trial
so
unfair
as
to
amount
to
a
taking
of
their
liberty
without
due
process
of
law.
and
i
think
on
this
record,
we
would
find
that
he
does
not
allege
anything
more
than
that
he
was
a
white
person.
he
doesn’t
allege
any
affinity
or
identification
with
those
who
are
excluded.
he
is
not
a
member
of
