mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
case
before
you
comes
on
a
simple
record
and
that
it
comes
simply
predicated
upon
the
filing
of
the
federal
habeas
corpus
petition
and
there
was
no
hearing,
and
then
it
was
dismissed
by
the
court.
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
fifth
circuit
stating
denial
of
equal
protection
of
the
law
and
due
process
of
law
as
it
related
to
the
claims
of
the
petitioner.
those
same
claims
where
in
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
and
they
related
to
the
systematic
exclusion
of
blacks
from
the
grand
jury
and
the
petit
jury.
all
of
which
where
taken
from
the
same
list
of
the
grand
jurors
and
the
petit
jurors.
that
claim
was
urged
in
the
circuit
court
and
was
urged
both
on
the
basis
of
equal
protection
and
due
process
in
violation
of
fourteenth
amendment.
it
is
from
the
denial
in
fifth
circuit
court.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
both
equal
protection
and
due
process.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
no
sir,
they
did
not.
they
dealt
with
both
the
language
said
petitioner
claims
a
violation
of
equal
protection
and
due
process
was
the
language
of
the
court’s
decision,
and
then
it
went
on
to
discuss
the
question
of
waiver,
and
then
finally
said
that
there
was
no
denial
of
equal
protection
but
it
acknowledge
that
we
have
raised
both
issues
in
the
prefatory
paragraphs
and
the
first
paragraphs
of
the
appendix.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
yes,
we
did.
and
i
believe,
it
is
in
the
opinion,
your
honor
that
we
allege
–-
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
the
first
question
in
your
petition
was
simply
either
said
stand?
that’s
correct.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
that
is
correct.
your
honor,
we
feel
that
it
is
before
this
court
for
consideration
based
on
the
record
in
the
case.
as
to
the
question
that
we
did
not
mentioned,
the
petit
jury
in
the
–-
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
it’s
not
--
i
would
not
say
it
was
exactly
historic
background
of
it.
it
is
the
sixth
amendment
as
incorporated
by
the
fourteenth
the
concept
of
duncan,
but
it
is
also
that
that
is
a
fundamental
concept
in
the
administration
of
justice
in
this
country.
and
that
basically,
the
due
process
therefore
requires.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
yes,
sir,
we
feel
that
based
upon
the
present
determination
of
what
a
jury
is
and
what
it
amounts
to
under
the
law
in
the
united
states,
and
in
georgia
that
it
necessarily
comprises
the
concept
of
representative
basis,
the
democratic
concept
of
the
jury.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
well,
he
is
denied
equal
protection
to
the
extent
that
there
are
different
juries
that
we’re
judging
so
that
his
case
is
affected
by
it.
to
that
extent
now
exactly
what
the
perimeters
of
that
are,
it
is
hard
to
say.
and
it
maybe
that
there
is
–-
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
well,
it
may
give
him
a
different
quality
of
justice.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
yes.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
yes,
and
the
effect
of
that
of
course
is
that
a
black
could
very
well
under
the
same
indictment
that
a
white
return
by
the
same
grand
jury.
might
well
file
his
attack
upon
the
composition
of
the
grand
jury
and
if
it
were
overrule,
he’d
have
the
chance
to
get
an
acquittal,
but
if
he
did
not,
he
could
appeal
on
that
basis
assuming
the
trial
court
aired
where
as
the
white
man
could
not
do
that.
now,
somehow,
that
presents
an
unequal
system.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
that
is
of
course
–-
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
that
is
the
essence
of
the
argument
and
to
great
extent
the
extent
of
the
argument.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
i
am
uninformed
upon
any
statistics
in
our
state
but
based
on
experience
and
outside
the
record,
i
would
say
that
we
have
representative
cross-section
of
the
various
religious
groups
on
our
juries.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
i
would
say
in
theory
yes.
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
the
court
would
not
have
to
go
that
far.
and
of
course,
you
would
first
have
to
reach
the
question
of
whether
they
where
identifiable
class
and
whether
or
not
that
left
--
i
do
not
think
you
can
go
into
the
question
of
the
extent
of
a
particular
prejudice.
i
would
say
yes
if
though,
if
there
was
identifiable
segment
of
the
community
and
those
where
excluded
that
the
concept
of
the
fundamental
concept
of
the
jury
would
require
that.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
no,
but
it
do
not.
now,
they
do
send
--
you
know,
you
cannot
get
that
information
in
the
clerk’s
office.
it
is
not
available
to
counsel
and
that
perhaps
at
the
time
of
the
compilation
of
the
voter
registration
list
from
which
our
juries
are
now
selected.
there
could
be
some
information
on
it,
but
i
am
not
familiar
with
it,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
it
provides
for
jury
trial
in
criminal
cases
your
honor
and
of
course
the
defendant
may
weight
it
in
all
criminal
cases
both
misdemeanor
and
felony.
in
considering
this
issue
of
course,
i
think
the
court
recognizes
that
the
black
man
acknowledge
that
he
can
complain,
and
the
state
seems
to
rely
on
some
concept
of
prejudice
as
needing
to
be
shown.
it
is
the
position
of
the
petitioner
that
in
fact
there
is
prejudice
to
the
petitioner,
and
that
that
prejudice
comes
from
the
essence
of
the
requirement
of
the
jury.
what
the
jury
means.
i
think
this
court
has
talked
about
the
value
of
the
cross-section
in
duncan
versus
louisiana
and
has
talked
about
it
in
williams
versus
florida,
and
i
think
there,
the
fact
that
there
must
be
between
the
government
and
the
defendant,
the
voice
of
the
people
has
been
recognized.
i
submit
to
you
that
one
of
the
consideration
should
be
that
is
the
voice
of
all
of
the
people.
now,
how
there
is
prejudice
is
a
more
speculative
matter?
it
is
speculative
in
that
you
have
to
analyze
what
a
jury
trial
in
fact
amounts
to
and
how
the
minds
of
respective
jurors
worked
but
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
in
fact
there
is
prejudice
when
the
broad
base
of
the
jury
is
destroyed
in
this
respect.
the
jury
stands
as
the
barrier
against
the
various
vices
that
it
can
occur
in
the
jury
trial.
now,
those
may
be
improper
acts
of
conduct
by
a
prosecutor,
hopefully
not
but
improper
acts
of
by
statute
--
by
a
judge,
or
improper
acts
by
a
juror,
a
particular
juror
such
as
someone
attempting
to
influence
the
jury.
in
addition
to
those
factors
that
the
jury
stands
as
a
buffer
between
there’s
the
question
of
the
nature
of
the
crime
and
how
that
particular
crime
affects
a
particular
jury.
all
the
standing
of
the
defendant,
his
particular
status
in
reference
to
the
community
that
it
is
about
to
try,
or
the
status
of
the
victim,
or
the
status
of
the
witnesses.
the
concept
that
i
submit
to
you
that
the
defendant
in
fact
is
prejudiced
is
that
as
to
those
possible
violations
and
those
possible
acts
that
depart
from
what
we
say
is
the
right
to
a
fair
jury
that
the
broader
the
base,
the
more
likely
who
there
is
that
they
will
not
be
the
influence
of
any
of
those
things
to
such
an
extent
is
to
deny
the
fairness
of
trial.
so,
i
think
the
very
concept
of
what
the
provision
for
trial
by
jury
means
is
that
we
try
to
strive
toward
the
system
that
will
get
us
the
fairest
possible
result.
so,
we
say
that
--
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
well,
i
would
say
fairest
jury,
and
the
result
be
in
that
you
if
you
have
a
fair
jury,
that
is
the
result
you
see.
that
that
is
the
closest
you
can
come
to
justice.
now,
we
are
not
talking
about
the
standpoint
of
what
one
side
of
the
other
wants
in
the
jury,
your
honor.
but
as
to
those
things,
the
broad
base
amount
to
insurance
in
reference
to
the
ability
of
the
jury
to
withstand
any
number
of
unfair
prejudice
issue.
so
as
to
that
very
basis
that
i
submit
to
you
that
the
concept
that
seems
to
have
been
the
basis
of
the
opinion
below
that
there
was
no
prejudice
to
this
man
is
it
not
or
to
a
white
person
complaining
the
exclusion
of
blacks
is
an
error
that
there
in
fact
is
a
prejudice.
and
of
course,
in
speaking
of
the
language
that
is
been
used
by
the
court’s,
there
is
a
narrowing
of
attitudes,
some
of
these
distinct
flavor
of
the
jury
is
lost,
and
you
can
also
consider
of
course
that
the
whole
is
different
from
the
parts.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
well,
as
broad
as
the
fabric
of
the
society
from
which
it
is
selected
your
honor.
and
hopefully,
that
would
include
all
of
the
eligible
citizens.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
hopefully,
we
can
get
that
by
the
court
sustaining
our
position
here.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
well,
like
you
have
--
we
select
the
juries
by
the
process
of
rejection,
and
if
the
prosecution
is
rejecting
those
--
if
he
doesn’t
feel
go
his
way
and
the
defense
is
objecting
the
once
that
we
looked
most
prosecution
–-
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
well,
i
could
not
name
a
number
of
course.
but,
i
think
we
need
all
of
the
identifiable
groups
in
the
community
that
exist
and
who
are
--
who
meet
the
other
qualifications
and
that
those
qualifications
–-
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
well,
the
economic
groups
or
any
the
religious
groups
if
they
find
--
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
that’s
all
the
thing
i
am
objecting
to
here
i
would
object
further.
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
that
was
the
only
one
we
knew
in
advance
that
in
fact
we
could
prove
without
difficulty
because
the
jury
list
had
been
selected
in
the
same
method
that
it
been
declared
to
be
invalid
previously
and
we
saw,
we
have
never
had
a
chance
to
present
proof
in
this
case.
in
the
record,
it
is
twice
been
filed.
it
has
never
been
any
evidentiary
hearing.
so
there’s
no
sense
that
--
from
my
standpoint,
no
sense
going
carrying
a
greater
burden
under
the
allegations
and
we
need
it.
it
was
rather
clear
that
there
was
a
disparity
that
previous
jury
list
selected
by
the
same
process
who
was
14%
black,
86%
white
and
the
percentages
were
substantially
different.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
that
is
correct
your
honor.
and
i
submit
that
–-
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
that
is
correct.
and
i
submit
that
the
practical
effects
of
the
trial
of
ordinary
criminal
cases,
if
analyze
and
if
there
were
statistics
will
illustrate
that
the
variety
of
circumstances
where
it
would
be
logical
for
counsel
on
one
side
or
the
other
to
see
the
implication
of
a
white
man
being
damaged
by
the
absence
of
blacks
in
rather
clear
terms
rather
than
the
terms
that
did
i
have
expressed
here
as
it
relates
to
the
fundamental
protections.
but
it
is
common
that
a
white
defendant
may
rely
upon
black
witnesses,
or
it
is
common
that
he
may
have
close
identification
by
many
means
with
a
black,
but
that
should
not
be
the
standard.
if
it
is,
we
get
into
an
interminable
question
of
when
does
prejudice
exist.
where
do
you
find
this
prejudice
and
how
do
you
determine?
then
that
will
open
up
a
scope
for
litigation
that
is
on
ending.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
and
that
it
be
a
representative
cross-section.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
right,
the
system
that
the
jury
be
drawn
from
that
representative
cross-section.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
yes.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
yes,
i
will.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
it
is
certainly
would
be
possible
for
this
court
to
take
that
position
and
to
add
that
to
the
argument
which
we
make.
and
that
as
that
was
pointed
out
by
the
amicus
in
this
case,
i
think
this
court
can
decide
the
decision
in
our
favor
without
having
to
do
that
and
declare
that.
i
think
the
court
should
declare
that.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
certainly
could
your
honor
and
i
think
the
court
should
do
it
on
both
basis
and
the
basis
point
out
the
amicus
certainly
a
good
one
to
do
at
all.
however,
i
think
the
court
can
also
say
that
it
would
stand
either
way
that
we
find
in
fact
when
you
deny
the
cross-section,
there
is
a
prejudice.
however,
you
don’t
have
to
find
in
the
prejudice
because
he
has
the
right
to
enforce
a
fair
system.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
no,
i
did
not,
one
individual
client.
i
think
that
--
i
wish
to
mention
that
the
case
of
fay
versus
new
york
is
not
against
the
petition
of
the
position
that
we
assert
here.
in
that
case,
there
was
a
failure
of
proof
on
the
allegations
that
were
made
by
the
petitioner.
that
case
also
was
decided
before
duncan
versus
louisiana
and
perhaps
the
court
would
have
viewed
the
problem
a
little
differently
at
that
stage,
and
the
court
in
fay
did
not
reach
the
issue
of
the
requirement
of
identity
in
that
case.
so,
we
submit
that
fay
is
not
against
us
and
of
course
would
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
logic
and
language
of
justice
murphy
in
dissent
in
that
case.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
i
don’t
believe
my
case
depends
--
the
petitioner’s
claim
depends
on
retroactive
application?
i
do
think
that
retroactive
application
is
very
much
needed
in
reference
to
a
matter
of
this
nature
to
avoid
the
type
of
process
that
this
particular
petitioner
has
gone
through
in
the
courts
of
raising
the
issuea
going
up,
coming
back,
going
back
in.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
so
that
we
can
have
a
simple
decision
that
is
workable
in
our
state
courts.
so
we
won’t
go
through
the
process
of
man
waiting
in
jail
while
we
go
to
our
state
courts
to
determine
the
question
of
retroactivity,
and
then
go
into
federal
court
to
again
wait
to
find
out
what
happened.
i
think
that
it
will
do
--
it
will
relieve
some
of
the
burden
on
the
federal
system
if
there
is
a
clear
pronunciation
and
it
is
dealt
with
and
i
would
see
nothing
to
prohibit
this
court
from
dealing
with
that
issue.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
well,
as
a
practical
effect,
most
of
those
people
and
this
is
outside
the
record
because
i
do
not
have
the
statistics.
but
since
the
jury
was
allegedly
corrected
in
1967
in
march
of
that
year,
most
of
those
people
that
would
be
affected
by
this
would
have
already
been
released
from
the
prison
system.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
they
would
be
release
also.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
if
they
haven’t
asserted
their
rights,
they
would
be
released.
they
should
have
asserted
their
rights
or
someone
should
have
asserted
--
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
i
think
the
effect
of
it,
it
is
in
georgia.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
it’s
been
applied
retroactively
in
georgia.
now,
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
the
question,
but
it
has
been
applied
retroactively.
i
ask
the
court
to
consider
in
reference
to
this,
the
possibility
that
could
occur
if
there
are
juries
in
the
state
of
georgia
and
other
states
that
are
invalidly
composed
and
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
this
type,
discrimination
does
still
in
fact
exist
and
does
occur.
i
wish
to
give
illustration
outside
the
record.
shortly
before
coming
here
three
weeks
ago
in
a
town
some
60
miles
south
of
atlanta,
the
superior
court
judge
declared
invalid
the
jury
list
upon
an
application
by
a
black
in
a
rape
case.
in
response
to
that,
the
three
white
jury
commissioners
resigned
in
protest.
now,
that
issue
had
not
been
raised,
have
not
been
pursued
in
that
court
until
1972.
what
the
reason
for
that
is,
is
that
in
your
rural
areas
where
--
if
there
is
type
of
discrimination
that
carries
over
into
the
system,
the
lawyers
generally
are
few,
are
engaged
in
a
more
local
practice.
they
fight
the
evidentiary
questions
in
the
court,
but
it
is
not
as
likely
that
the
constitutional
concepts
are
litigated
or
fought
and
it
is
brought
out.
so,
the
fact
there
will
be
a
beneficial
effect
of
this
type
of
decision
is
illustrated
by
the
fact
that
these
prejudices
can
in
fact
occur
and
continue
eventhough
the
system
that
was
used
in
this
particular
case
has
been
rejected.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
i
wish
to
urge
that
this
court
take
the
position
and
declare
that
one
of
the
fundamental
concepts
of
the
trial
by
jury
is
the
right
of
all
citizens
to
a
representative
cross-section.
and
we
take
issue
with
the
statement
that
this
jury
from
which
blacks
where
excluded,
favored
the
petitioner.
that
is
to
assume
that
it
had
a
bias
of
some
sort
and
assuming,
you
can
say
that
it
was
a
white
bias.
we
say
all
juries
should
be
absent,
white
bias
or
other
type
of
bias,
and
that
that
is
the
fundamental
issue
here.
in
commenting
upon
what
has
been
the
status
of
the
law
which
to
quote
in
conclusion
from
justice
wisdom
in
labat
v.
bennett
where
he
quoted
from
shakespeare’s
measure
for
measure
and
that
is
that
“the
law
have
not
been
dead,
though
it
has
been
asleep.”
we
ask
you
to
wake
it
up
as
it
relates
to
the
right
of
a
representative
cross-section.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
case
before
you
comes
on
a
simple
record
and
that
it
comes
simply
predicated
upon
the
filing
of
the
federal
habeas
corpus
petition
and
there
was
no
hearing,
and
then
it
was
dismissed
by
the
court.
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
fifth
circuit
stating
denial
of
equal
protection
of
the
law
and
due
process
of
law
as
it
related
to
the
claims
of
the
petitioner.
those
same
claims
where
in
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
and
they
related
to
the
systematic
exclusion
of
blacks
from
the
grand
jury
and
the
petit
jury.
all
of
which
where
taken
from
the
same
list
of
the
grand
jurors
and
the
petit
jurors.
that
claim
was
urged
in
the
circuit
court
and
was
urged
both
on
the
basis
of
equal
protection
and
due
process
in
violation
of
fourteenth
amendment.
it
is
from
the
denial
in
fifth
circuit
court.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
both
equal
protection
and
due
process.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
no
sir,
they
did
not.
they
dealt
with
both
the
language
said
petitioner
claims
a
violation
of
equal
protection
and
due
process
was
the
language
of
the
court’s
decision,
and
then
it
went
on
to
discuss
the
question
of
waiver,
and
then
finally
said
that
there
was
no
denial
of
equal
protection
but
it
acknowledge
that
we
have
raised
both
issues
in
the
prefatory
paragraphs
and
the
first
paragraphs
of
the
appendix.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
yes,
we
did.
and
i
believe,
it
is
in
the
opinion,
your
honor
that
we
allege
–-
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
the
first
question
in
your
petition
was
simply
either
said
stand?
that’s
correct.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
that
is
correct.
your
honor,
we
feel
that
it
is
before
this
court
for
consideration
based
on
the
record
in
the
case.
as
to
the
question
that
we
did
not
mentioned,
the
petit
jury
in
the
–-
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
it’s
not
--
i
would
not
say
it
was
exactly
historic
background
of
it.
it
is
the
sixth
amendment
as
incorporated
by
the
fourteenth
the
concept
of
duncan,
but
it
is
also
that
that
is
a
fundamental
concept
in
the
administration
of
justice
in
this
country.
and
that
basically,
the
due
process
therefore
requires.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
yes,
sir,
we
feel
that
based
upon
the
present
determination
of
what
a
jury
is
and
what
it
amounts
to
under
the
law
in
the
united
states,
and
in
georgia
that
it
necessarily
comprises
the
concept
of
representative
basis,
the
democratic
concept
of
the
jury.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
well,
he
is
denied
equal
protection
to
the
extent
that
there
are
different
juries
that
we’re
judging
so
that
his
case
is
affected
by
it.
to
that
extent
now
exactly
what
the
perimeters
of
that
are,
it
is
hard
to
say.
and
it
maybe
that
there
is
–-
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
well,
it
may
give
him
a
different
quality
of
justice.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
yes.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
yes,
and
the
effect
of
that
of
course
is
that
a
black
could
very
well
under
the
same
indictment
that
a
white
return
by
the
same
grand
jury.
might
well
file
his
attack
upon
the
composition
of
the
grand
jury
and
if
it
were
overrule,
he’d
have
the
chance
to
get
an
acquittal,
but
if
he
did
not,
he
could
appeal
on
that
basis
assuming
the
trial
court
aired
where
as
the
white
man
could
not
do
that.
now,
somehow,
that
presents
an
unequal
system.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
that
is
of
course
–-
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
that
is
the
essence
of
the
argument
and
to
great
extent
the
extent
of
the
argument.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
i
am
uninformed
upon
any
statistics
in
our
state
but
based
on
experience
and
outside
the
record,
i
would
say
that
we
have
representative
cross-section
of
the
various
religious
groups
on
our
juries.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
i
would
say
in
theory
yes.
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
the
court
would
not
have
to
go
that
far.
and
of
course,
you
would
first
have
to
reach
the
question
of
whether
they
where
identifiable
class
and
whether
or
not
that
left
--
i
do
not
think
you
can
go
into
the
question
of
the
extent
of
a
particular
prejudice.
i
would
say
yes
if
though,
if
there
was
identifiable
segment
of
the
community
and
those
where
excluded
that
the
concept
of
the
fundamental
concept
of
the
jury
would
require
that.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
no,
but
it
do
not.
now,
they
do
send
--
you
know,
you
cannot
get
that
information
in
the
clerk’s
office.
it
is
not
available
to
counsel
and
that
perhaps
at
the
time
of
the
compilation
of
the
voter
registration
list
from
which
our
juries
are
now
selected.
there
could
be
some
information
on
it,
but
i
am
not
familiar
with
it,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
it
provides
for
jury
trial
in
criminal
cases
your
honor
and
of
course
the
defendant
may
weight
it
in
all
criminal
cases
both
misdemeanor
and
felony.
in
considering
this
issue
of
course,
i
think
the
court
recognizes
that
the
black
man
acknowledge
that
he
can
complain,
and
the
state
seems
to
rely
on
some
concept
of
prejudice
as
needing
to
be
shown.
it
is
the
position
of
the
petitioner
that
in
fact
there
is
prejudice
to
the
petitioner,
and
that
that
prejudice
comes
from
the
essence
of
the
requirement
of
the
jury.
what
the
jury
means.
i
think
this
court
has
talked
about
the
value
of
the
cross-section
in
duncan
versus
louisiana
and
has
talked
about
it
in
williams
versus
florida,
and
i
think
there,
the
fact
that
there
must
be
between
the
government
and
the
defendant,
the
voice
of
the
people
has
been
recognized.
i
submit
to
you
that
one
of
the
consideration
should
be
that
is
the
voice
of
all
of
the
people.
now,
how
there
is
prejudice
is
a
more
speculative
matter?
it
is
speculative
in
that
you
have
to
analyze
what
a
jury
trial
in
fact
amounts
to
and
how
the
minds
of
respective
jurors
worked
but
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
in
fact
there
is
prejudice
when
the
broad
base
of
the
jury
is
destroyed
in
this
respect.
the
jury
stands
as
the
barrier
against
the
various
vices
that
it
can
occur
in
the
jury
trial.
now,
those
may
be
improper
acts
of
conduct
by
a
prosecutor,
hopefully
not
but
improper
acts
of
by
statute
--
by
a
judge,
or
improper
acts
by
a
juror,
a
particular
juror
such
as
someone
attempting
to
influence
the
jury.
in
addition
to
those
factors
that
the
jury
stands
as
a
buffer
between
there’s
the
question
of
the
nature
of
the
crime
and
how
that
particular
crime
affects
a
particular
jury.
all
the
standing
of
the
defendant,
his
particular
status
in
reference
to
the
community
that
it
is
about
to
try,
or
the
status
of
the
victim,
or
the
status
of
the
witnesses.
the
concept
that
i
submit
to
you
that
the
defendant
in
fact
is
prejudiced
is
that
as
to
those
possible
violations
and
those
possible
acts
that
depart
from
what
we
say
is
the
right
to
a
fair
jury
that
the
broader
the
base,
the
more
likely
who
there
is
that
they
will
not
be
the
influence
of
any
of
those
things
to
such
an
extent
is
to
deny
the
fairness
of
trial.
so,
i
think
the
very
concept
of
what
the
provision
for
trial
by
jury
means
is
that
we
try
to
strive
toward
the
system
that
will
get
us
the
fairest
possible
result.
so,
we
say
that
--
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
well,
i
would
say
fairest
jury,
and
the
result
be
in
that
you
if
you
have
a
fair
jury,
that
is
the
result
you
see.
that
that
is
the
closest
you
can
come
to
justice.
now,
we
are
not
talking
about
the
standpoint
of
what
one
side
of
the
other
wants
in
the
jury,
your
honor.
but
as
to
those
things,
the
broad
base
amount
to
insurance
in
reference
to
the
ability
of
the
jury
to
withstand
any
number
of
unfair
prejudice
issue.
so
as
to
that
very
basis
that
i
submit
to
you
that
the
concept
that
seems
to
have
been
the
basis
of
the
opinion
below
that
there
was
no
prejudice
to
this
man
is
it
not
or
to
a
white
person
complaining
the
exclusion
of
blacks
is
an
error
that
there
in
fact
is
a
prejudice.
and
of
course,
in
speaking
of
the
language
that
is
been
used
by
the
court’s,
there
is
a
narrowing
of
attitudes,
some
of
these
distinct
flavor
of
the
jury
is
lost,
and
you
can
also
consider
of
course
that
the
whole
is
different
from
the
parts.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
well,
as
broad
as
the
fabric
of
the
society
from
which
it
is
selected
your
honor.
and
hopefully,
that
would
include
all
of
the
eligible
citizens.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
hopefully,
we
can
get
that
by
the
court
sustaining
our
position
here.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
well,
like
you
have
--
we
select
the
juries
by
the
process
of
rejection,
and
if
the
prosecution
is
rejecting
those
--
if
he
doesn’t
feel
go
his
way
and
the
defense
is
objecting
the
once
that
we
looked
most
prosecution
–-
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
well,
i
could
not
name
a
number
of
course.
but,
i
think
we
need
all
of
the
identifiable
groups
in
the
community
that
exist
and
who
are
--
who
meet
the
other
qualifications
and
that
those
qualifications
–-
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
well,
the
economic
groups
or
any
the
religious
groups
if
they
find
--
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
that’s
all
the
thing
i
am
objecting
to
here
i
would
object
further.
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
that
was
the
only
one
we
knew
in
advance
that
in
fact
we
could
prove
without
difficulty
because
the
jury
list
had
been
selected
in
the
same
method
that
it
been
declared
to
be
invalid
previously
and
we
saw,
we
have
never
had
a
chance
to
present
proof
in
this
case.
in
the
record,
it
is
twice
been
filed.
it
has
never
been
any
evidentiary
hearing.
so
there’s
no
sense
that
--
from
my
standpoint,
no
sense
going
carrying
a
greater
burden
under
the
allegations
and
we
need
it.
it
was
rather
clear
that
there
was
a
disparity
that
previous
jury
list
selected
by
the
same
process
who
was
14%
black,
86%
white
and
the
percentages
were
substantially
different.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
that
is
correct
your
honor.
and
i
submit
that
–-
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
that
is
correct.
and
i
submit
that
the
practical
effects
of
the
trial
of
ordinary
criminal
cases,
if
analyze
and
if
there
were
statistics
will
illustrate
that
the
variety
of
circumstances
where
it
would
be
logical
for
counsel
on
one
side
or
the
other
to
see
the
implication
of
a
white
man
being
damaged
by
the
absence
of
blacks
in
rather
clear
terms
rather
than
the
terms
that
did
i
have
expressed
here
as
it
relates
to
the
fundamental
protections.
but
it
is
common
that
a
white
defendant
may
rely
upon
black
witnesses,
or
it
is
common
that
he
may
have
close
identification
by
many
means
with
a
black,
but
that
should
not
be
the
standard.
if
it
is,
we
get
into
an
interminable
question
of
when
does
prejudice
exist.
where
do
you
find
this
prejudice
and
how
do
you
determine?
then
that
will
open
up
a
scope
for
litigation
that
is
on
ending.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
and
that
it
be
a
representative
cross-section.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
right,
the
system
that
the
jury
be
drawn
from
that
representative
cross-section.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
yes.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
yes,
i
will.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
it
is
certainly
would
be
possible
for
this
court
to
take
that
position
and
to
add
that
to
the
argument
which
we
make.
and
that
as
that
was
pointed
out
by
the
amicus
in
this
case,
i
think
this
court
can
decide
the
decision
in
our
favor
without
having
to
do
that
and
declare
that.
i
think
the
court
should
declare
that.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
certainly
could
your
honor
and
i
think
the
court
should
do
it
on
both
basis
and
the
basis
point
out
the
amicus
certainly
a
good
one
to
do
at
all.
however,
i
think
the
court
can
also
say
that
it
would
stand
either
way
that
we
find
in
fact
when
you
deny
the
cross-section,
there
is
a
prejudice.
however,
you
don’t
have
to
find
in
the
prejudice
because
he
has
the
right
to
enforce
a
fair
system.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
no,
i
did
not,
one
individual
client.
i
think
that
--
i
wish
to
mention
that
the
case
of
fay
versus
new
york
is
not
against
the
petition
of
the
position
that
we
assert
here.
in
that
case,
there
was
a
failure
of
proof
on
the
allegations
that
were
made
by
the
petitioner.
that
case
also
was
decided
before
duncan
versus
louisiana
and
perhaps
the
court
would
have
viewed
the
problem
a
little
differently
at
that
stage,
and
the
court
in
fay
did
not
reach
the
issue
of
the
requirement
of
identity
in
that
case.
so,
we
submit
that
fay
is
not
against
us
and
of
course
would
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
logic
and
language
of
justice
murphy
in
dissent
in
that
case.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
i
don’t
believe
my
case
depends
--
the
petitioner’s
claim
depends
on
retroactive
application?
i
do
think
that
retroactive
application
is
very
much
needed
in
reference
to
a
matter
of
this
nature
to
avoid
the
type
of
process
that
this
particular
petitioner
has
gone
through
in
the
courts
of
raising
the
issuea
going
up,
coming
back,
going
back
in.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
so
that
we
can
have
a
simple
decision
that
is
workable
in
our
state
courts.
so
we
won’t
go
through
the
process
of
man
waiting
in
jail
while
we
go
to
our
state
courts
to
determine
the
question
of
retroactivity,
and
then
go
into
federal
court
to
again
wait
to
find
out
what
happened.
i
think
that
it
will
do
--
it
will
relieve
some
of
the
burden
on
the
federal
system
if
there
is
a
clear
pronunciation
and
it
is
dealt
with
and
i
would
see
nothing
to
prohibit
this
court
from
dealing
with
that
issue.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
well,
as
a
practical
effect,
most
of
those
people
and
this
is
outside
the
record
because
i
do
not
have
the
statistics.
but
since
the
jury
was
allegedly
corrected
in
1967
in
march
of
that
year,
most
of
those
people
that
would
be
affected
by
this
would
have
already
been
released
from
the
prison
system.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
they
would
be
release
also.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
if
they
haven’t
asserted
their
rights,
they
would
be
released.
they
should
have
asserted
their
rights
or
someone
should
have
asserted
--
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
i
think
the
effect
of
it,
it
is
in
georgia.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
it’s
been
applied
retroactively
in
georgia.
now,
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
the
question,
but
it
has
been
applied
retroactively.
i
ask
the
court
to
consider
in
reference
to
this,
the
possibility
that
could
occur
if
there
are
juries
in
the
state
of
georgia
and
other
states
that
are
invalidly
composed
and
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
this
type,
discrimination
does
still
in
fact
exist
and
does
occur.
i
wish
to
give
illustration
outside
the
record.
shortly
before
coming
here
three
weeks
ago
in
a
town
some
60
miles
south
of
atlanta,
the
superior
court
judge
declared
invalid
the
jury
list
upon
an
application
by
a
black
in
a
rape
case.
in
response
to
that,
the
three
white
jury
commissioners
resigned
in
protest.
now,
that
issue
had
not
been
raised,
have
not
been
pursued
in
that
court
until
1972.
what
the
reason
for
that
is,
is
that
in
your
rural
areas
where
--
if
there
is
type
of
discrimination
that
carries
over
into
the
system,
the
lawyers
generally
are
few,
are
engaged
in
a
more
local
practice.
they
fight
the
evidentiary
questions
in
the
court,
but
it
is
not
as
likely
that
the
constitutional
concepts
are
litigated
or
fought
and
it
is
brought
out.
so,
the
fact
there
will
be
a
beneficial
effect
of
this
type
of
decision
is
illustrated
by
the
fact
that
these
prejudices
can
in
fact
occur
and
continue
eventhough
the
system
that
was
used
in
this
particular
case
has
been
rejected.
mr.
edward
t.
m.
garland
i
wish
to
urge
that
this
court
take
the
position
and
declare
that
one
of
the
fundamental
concepts
of
the
trial
by
jury
is
the
right
of
all
citizens
to
a
representative
cross-section.
and
we
take
issue
with
the
statement
that
this
jury
from
which
blacks
where
excluded,
favored
the
petitioner.
that
is
to
assume
that
it
had
a
bias
of
some
sort
and
assuming,
you
can
say
that
it
was
a
white
bias.
we
say
all
juries
should
be
absent,
white
bias
or
other
type
of
bias,
and
that
that
is
the
fundamental
issue
here.
in
commenting
upon
what
has
been
the
status
of
the
law
which
to
quote
in
conclusion
from
justice
wisdom
in
labat
v.
bennett
where
he
quoted
from
shakespeare’s
measure
for
measure
and
that
is
that
“the
law
have
not
been
dead,
though
it
has
been
asleep.”
we
ask
you
to
wake
it
up
as
it
relates
to
the
right
of
a
representative
cross-section.
thank
you
very
much.
