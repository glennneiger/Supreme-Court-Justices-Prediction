unknown
speaker
did
you
present
the
both
grounds
for
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
i
see,
they
are
both
that
you
are
petition
for
habeas
corpus?
unknown
speaker
and
you
presented
both
arguments
to
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
and
they
responded
to
just
one?
unknown
speaker
this
is
the
most
recent
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
opinion
at
page
20
of
the
record
though?
or
whether
they
dealt
with
it
or
not
expressly,
you
presented
to
them?
unknown
speaker
you
did
present
the
issue?
yes,
we
did
and
it
was
in
the
brief
that
accompanied
the
petition
in
the
district
court,
as
well
as
the
briefs
in
the
circuit
court
and
by
the
counsel
of
this,
they
would
not
stated
adequately
in
our
question
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
but
we
feel
both
concepts
before
the
court
since
it
was
a
matter
of
the
law
that
was
--
unknown
speaker
i
have
assumed
what
you
are
saying
is
that
you
argued
standing
from
to
stands,
from
two
to
that
point?
unknown
speaker
tell
me
more
precisely
what
your
due
process
ground
is,
is
it
historic
fairness
or
is
it
sixth
amendment
as
incorporated
in
the
fourteenth?
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
that
concept
of
a
jury
necessarily
includes
the
–-
unknown
speaker
consider
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
tell
me
how
they
--
tell
me
how
a
white
man
is
denied
equal
protection
laws
by
exclusion
of
negro?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
know.
but
that
does
not
distinguish
him
from
anybody
else?
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
that
a
negro
would
have
a
--
would
have
the
right
to
have
a
negro
included
on
the
jury
and
have
and
be
closer
to
a
fair
cross
section
with
a
white
man
on
trial?
unknown
speaker
is
that
your
argument?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
like
it
sounds
like
you
are
arguing
at
least
partly
that
everyone
is
entitled
to
a
jury
with
a
fair
cross-section
of
--
unknown
speaker
he
denies
anybody
who
had
been
discriminated?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)require
jury
trial
in
criminal
cases?
unknown
speaker
mr.
garland?
unknown
speaker
it
is
of
course
well
settled
as
i
am
sure
you
will
concede
that
there’s
nothing
in
the
constitution
that
requires
even
in
a
case
where
negro
defendant
is
on
trial
in
the
state
court.
there’s
nothing
in
the
constitution
that
requires
that
even
the
grand
or
the
petit
jury
have
honored
any
negroes,
that’s
correct,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
the
only
constitution
requirement
is
that
a
non
discriminatory
system
of
jury
selection,
you
would
agree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
the
system?
not
with
any
particular
jury
representing
the
cross-section?
unknown
speaker
that
the
system
be
one
designed
to
get
a
representative
cross-section?
would
you
agree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
and
it
is
been
explicitly
held
that
there
is
no
requirement
even
as
i
say
in
a
case
of
a
negro
defendant
that
if
there
any
negroes
at
all
on
his
jury,
you
would
agree
with
that
one?
unknown
speaker
and
yet,
a
defendant
has
been
allowed
to
attack
a
system
even
in
the
light
of
those
holdings
and
wouldn’t
it
then
be
possible
to
argue
your
case
in
a
quite
and
different
way
from
the
way
you
have
argued
that
date
and
that
is
on
these
lines
that
this
is
one
of
the
very
few
cases
perhaps,
one
of
very
few
situation
where
this
court
going
way
back
strauder
against
west
virginian
back
in
1879
in
those
early
cases
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
this
is
one
of
the
few
cases
where
a
court
has
allowed
somebody
who
cannot
actually
show
prejudice
in
his
case
to
represent
the
rights
of
other
people,
i.e.
negroes
in
the
community
to
serve
on
the
jury.
and
that
right,
this
was
established
way
back
in
the
19th
century
and
was
reaffirmed
as
recently
as
year
or
two
ago
in
the
carter
case
in
this
court
and
the
companion
case
in
which
we
allowed
negroes
themselves
to
sue,
to
serve
on
a
jury,
not
that
your
client
was
denied
equal
protection.
not
that
your
client
was
denied
due
process
but
you
are
representing
--
your
clients
representing
the
rights
of
negroes
in
the
community
for
an
opportunity
for
citizen
service
on
grand
and
petit
jury.
couldn’t
be
possible
to
argue
your
case
along
those
lines?
unknown
speaker
but
the
point
is,
the
court
could
if
there’s
any
merit
in
that
position,
if
there
is
a
merit
time
position
could
decide
the
case
on
your
favor
without
any
planning
of
prejudice
to
your
client
whatsoever.
unknown
speaker
mr.
garland,
you
argue
in
your
brief
and
you
mentioned
that
that
set
of
your
argument
here
that
retroactivity
is
an
important
point
in
this
case.
i
wish
you
would
state
for
my
benefit
to
what
extent
your
case
depends
on
retroactivity?
unknown
speaker
if
this
is
not
a
class
action
and
if
your
own
client’s
rights
do
not
depend
on
retroactivity,
why
do
you
press
it?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
accept
the
court
of
appeals
decision
that
there
was
a
exhaustion?
unknown
speaker
doesn’t
it
have
to
be
compliance
with
the
habeas
corpus
statute
though?
unknown
speaker
well,
was
there
or
wasn’t
there?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
are
you
urging
that
point
here
to
sustain
the
judgment
below
or
not?
unknown
speaker
but
still
there
must
be
compliance
with
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
but
if
there
is
a
--
whether
the
party
is
raising
or
not,
i
suppose
we
can
notice
a
plain
error?
unknown
speaker
you
don’t
mean
to
say
you
are
abandoning
the
possible
support
of
the
judgment
below
by
reason
of
--
unknown
speaker
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
the
second
ground
for
dismissal.
unknown
speaker
and
so,
there
had
been
exhaustion
and
compliance
with
the
statute
--
unknown
speaker
that
they
would
not
require
to
do.
unknown
speaker
you
are
saying
that’s
wrong?
unknown
speaker
well
he
is
the
only
one
who
can
raise
the
point.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
and
he
argued
straight
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
and
incorporation
of
the
sixth
amendment
as
binding
on
that
states
and
he
says
the
concept
of
the
jury
requires
that
no
substantial
group
in
the
community
be
systematically
excluded?
or
i
do
not
have
the
kind
of
a
jury
i
am
entitled
to?
unknown
speaker
but
he
says
i
cannot
really
say,
i
cannot
show
any
specific
prejudice
in
my
case,
but
i
am
entitled
to
be
tried
by
jury
that
is
fairly
representative
of
the
conscious
that
served
it
and
he
cites
witherspoon
and
a
few
other
cases,
and
ballard
and
he
would
sustain
that
point
on
strictly
due
process
ground,
fully
aside
from
equal
protection?
unknown
speaker
you’re
saying
that
the
cross-section
requirement
for
a
jury
must
be
tied
with
the
possibility
of
partiality
or
prejudice?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that
the
left
--
whatever
the
case
in
our
decision
in
fay
versus
new
york
is
no
showing
of
prejudice,
actual
prejudice
there?
this
was
a
case
of
the
blue
ribbon
jury,
do
you
remember?
unknown
speaker
our
courts’
decided
five
to
four.
i
dissented
but
the
court
decided
five
to
four
that
that
was
a
properly
selected
jury.
and
the
argument
against
it
was
not
that
this
man
was
then
he
spoke
that
if
you
take
a
group
of
the
upper
class
and
put
them
on
the
juries
and
deal
with
property
offenses,
you’re
up
to
get
a
prejudice
jury
against
the
defendants.
unknown
speaker
we
don’t
know,
i
mean,
if
whites,
maybe
some
whites
would
like
to
have
blacks
on
it,
they’d
be
more
sympathetic
in
light
of
the
nature
of
the
charge
made
against
him.
we
don’t
know.
this
is
a
highly
speculative.
unknown
speaker
stayed
out
the
constitution?
it’s
a
definition
of
a
jury
trial.
what
is
a
jury
trial?
this
was
the
issue
that
we
face
i
think
in
fay
v.
new
york
and
we
unfortunately,
adopted
your
point
of
view
i
think.
unknown
speaker
but
i
supposed
we
thought
it
logically,
if
you
decide
that
jury
can
mean
anything
that
a
local
prosecutor
in
a
local
court
decides
it
should
mean?
unknown
speaker
that
now,
then
it
comes
out
of
prejudice
in
a
particular
case,
but
i
thought
we
have
definition
of
constitution
term
what
the
jury
trial
mean?
it
is
like
a
speech.
what
is
pressed,
does
that
include
the
obscenity?
what
is
a
criminal
prosecution
that
sixth
amendment,
does
it
include
arraignment?
that
many
things
of
that
kind.
unknown
speaker
where
you
don’t
have
a
showing
of
prejudice
in
a
particular
case
but
the
scope
of
the
designing
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
on
that
basis,
that
all
of
the
court
dealing
with
the
grand
jury?
unknown
speaker
have
you
--
you
probably
have
read
strauder
against
west
virginia
very
recently,
don’t
you?
unknown
speaker
did
you
present
the
both
grounds
for
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
i
see,
they
are
both
that
you
are
petition
for
habeas
corpus?
unknown
speaker
and
you
presented
both
arguments
to
the

of

of

oh,
i

but
that
does
not
distinguish

from

are

that
a

mr.

that

is
an

if
your

do
not

why
do
you
press
it?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
accept
the
court
of
appeals
decision
that
there
was
a

unknown
speaker
doesn’t
it
have
to
be
compliance
with

statute
though?
unknown

well,
was
there
or
wasn’t
there?
unknown

well
then,
are
you

the

and
so,
there
had
been
exhaustion
and
compliance
with
the
statute
--
unknown
speaker
that
they
would
not
require
to
do.
unknown
speaker
you
are
saying
that’s
wrong?
unknown
speaker
well
he
is
the
only
one
who
can
raise
the
point.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown

and
he
argued
straight
fourteenth

of
partiality
or
prejudice?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that
the
left
--
whatever
the
case
in
our
decision
in
fay
versus
new
york
is
no
showing
of
prejudice,
actual
prejudice
there?
this
was
a
case
of
the
blue
ribbon
jury,
do
you
remember?
unknown
speaker
our
courts’
decided
five
to
four.
i
dissented
but
the
court
decided
five
to
four
that
that
was
a
properly
selected
jury.
and
the
argument
against
it
was
not
that
this
man
was
then
he
spoke
that
if
you
take
a
group
of
the
upper
class
and
put
them
on
the
juries
and
deal
with
property
offenses,
you’re
up
to
get
a
prejudice
jury
against
the
defendants.
unknown
speaker
we
don’t
know,
i
mean,
if
whites,
maybe
some
whites
would
like
to
have
blacks
on
it,
they’d
be
more
sympathetic
in
light
of
the
nature
of
the
charge
made
against
him.
we
don’t
know.
this
is
a
highly
speculative.
unknown
speaker
stayed
out
the
constitution?
it’s
a
definition
of
a
jury
trial.
what
is
a
jury
trial?
this
was
the
issue
that
we
face
i
think
in
fay
v.
new
york
and
we
unfortunately,
adopted
your
point
of
view
i
think.
unknown
speaker
but
i
supposed
we
thought
it
logically,
if
you
decide
that
jury
can
mean
anything
that
a
local
prosecutor
in
a
local
court
decides
it
should
mean?
unknown
speaker
that
now,
then
it
comes
out
of
prejudice
in
a
particular
case,
but
i
thought
we
have
definition
of
constitution
term
what
the
jury
trial
mean?
it
is
like
a
speech.
what
is
pressed,
does
that
include
the
obscenity?
what
is
a
criminal
prosecution
that
sixth
amendment,
does
it
include
arraignment?
that
many
things
of
that
kind.
unknown
speaker
where
you
don’t
have
a
showing
of
prejudice
in
a
particular
case
but
the
scope
of
the
designing
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
on
that
basis,
that
all
of
the
court
dealing
with
the
grand
jury?
unknown
speaker
have
you
--
you
probably
have
read
strauder
against
west
virginia
very
recently,
don’t
you?
