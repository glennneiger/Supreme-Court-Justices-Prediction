justice

mr.
garland,
how
broad
does
a
jury
have
to
be?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
do
you
get
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
can
you
get
a
real
cross-section
of
jury
when
the
prosecution
is
busily
engaged
in
not
getting
a
fair
jury
but
a
pro-prosecution
jury
and
defense
counsel
is
not
interested
in
getting
the
fair
jury
but
getting
a
pro-defendants
jury,
how
do
you
get
that
big
cross-section?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
many
different
areas
and
different
types,
different
groups
do
you
need
in
the
big
jury
box,
the
wheel?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
do
mean
other
than
all
of
the
racial
group?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh,
you
do
not
object
to
that,
did
you?
the
only
you
objected
the
racial
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
but
your
basis
for
that
is
that
you
have
this
broad
base
you
need,
and
you
only
complain
because
no
negro
was
considered?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
your
position
is
you
are
not
arguing
so
much
about
who
should
be
in
there
but
you
want
to
be
sure,
nobody
is
kept
out,
is
that
your
position?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
no
discernable
group
is
kept
out,
that’s
your
position.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
means
every
man
in
this
county
is
released,
every
white
man?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
those
that
were
still
there
would
be
released?
that
is
what
you
want?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what
about
the
negroes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
could
they,
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
why
does
was
made
retroactive
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
it
made
retroactive?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mrs.
beasley,
what
he
says
that
one
that
he
is
entitled
to
a
jury
from
which
no
discernible
group
is
systematically
excluded?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
he
is
entitled
to
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
don’t
think
as
a
general
principle
that
he
has
a
right
to
a
jury
from
which
no
discernible
group
is
systematically
excluded?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
would
it
be
alright
if
they
excluded
all
wage
earners?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
that
be
alright?
that
would
be
alright?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
what
i
should
think.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
that
is
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
that
if
two
people,
a
black
man
and
a
negro
and
a
white
man
were
both
charge
with
robbery
of
the
same
robbery
and
they
are
tried
by
the
same
jury,
the
negroes
got
a
good
point
that
the
white
man
had.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
is
that
therefore
a
bad
jury?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no.
is
that
therefore
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
unfortunately,
i
am
sure
you
can’t
say
there
is
such
a
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
mrs.
beasley,
let’s
assume
that
the
defendant
here
was
a
negro
and
he
raised
only
the
due
process
by
as
i
am
not
claiming
a
denial
of
equal
protection
at
all,
i
am
pointing
strictly
six
of
them
with
due
process,
namely
i
am
entitled
to
be
tried
by
jury
representative
for
the
community?
he
says
i
do
not
want
any
decision
about
equal
protection,
i
think
that
i
just
don’t
believe
in
that
equal
protection
rationale.
and
i
take
it
a
while
ago
you
said
that
you
did
not
disagree
with
that
fundamental
constitutional
argument
about
the
jury?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
at
that
point,
would
you
sustain
his
claim
there
on
strictly
due
process,
sixth
amendment?
