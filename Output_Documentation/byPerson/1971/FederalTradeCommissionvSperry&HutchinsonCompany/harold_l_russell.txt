mr.
harold
l.
russell
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
i
would
like
to
note
that
actually
the
only
paragraph
of
the
order
with
which
we
are
concerned
is
paragraph
5
which
appears
at
pages
127,
128
of
joint
appendix.
all
we
want
to
do
is
to
be
able
as
i
have
said
unilaterally
and
all
by
our
selves
to
go
to
court
as
we
have
done
for
75
years
to
protect
the
quality
and
integrity
of
our
stamp
business
by
stopping
unauthorized
trafficking
in
stamps.
s&h
is
in
the
business
of
licensing
retail
merchants
to
use
its
sales
promotion
system
which
is
based
upon
the
use
of
s&h
trading
stamps.
retail
merchants
subscribe
to
that
service
to
increase
trade
and
to
maintain
and
enhance
customer
loyalty.
they
use
stamps
to
get
their
customers
to
return
to
their
stores
again
and
again
until
they
have
collected
enough
stamps
to
secure
redemption
merchandise
of
their
choice.
throughout
the
history
of
this
company,
non
licensed
retailers,
stamps
exchangers
have
attempted
to
cash
in
on
the
s&h
system
without
paying
for
the
s&h
service.
by
purchasing,
exchanging
and
making
other
commercial
use
of
s&h
stamps
without
s&h
authorization.
now
the
reason
we
have
consistently
sought
judicial
relief
and
the
reason
why
the
courts
have
enjoined
it.
is
that
if
competing
merchants
were
free
to
redeem
s&h
stamps
issued
by
s&h
licensees
for
their
own
merchandise
or
they
could
exchange
s&h
stamps
for
their
own
stamps
or
the
consumers
could
get
stamps
of
trading
stamps
exchanges
rather
than
as
a
licensee.
the
s&h
system
had
lost
its
attraction
for
the
licensees
to
after
all
of
the
people
who
pay
s&h
for
the
use
of
its
service.
in
fact,
in
the
case
of
unauthorized
redeeming
retailer,
the
s&h
system
could
be
turned
into
an
instrument
to
introduce
the
s&h
licensee’s
customers
to
the
store
of
a
non
licensed
competitor.
this
is
a
basic
reason
why
the
court
of
equity
has
consistently
granted
judicial
relief
to
s&h
against
unauthorized
traffickers.
holding
at
these
traffickers
have
been
engaged
in
unfair
competition
and
tortuous
interference
with
s&h
contractual
and
business
relations.
the
central
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
s&h
actions
in
preventing
the
unauthorized
commercial
use
of
its
trading
stamps
by
obtaining
judicial
relief
against
the
abuse
constitutes
an
unfair
practice
violating
section
5.
the
petitioner’s
main
argument
is
that
s&h
actions
violate
section
5
and
that
because
of
the
court
restraints.
s&h
stamps
savers
do
not
have
complete
freedom
of
choice
in
the
transfer
of
their
stamps.
this
is
alleged
to
be
unfair
to
consumers
who
are
said
thereby
to
be
deprived
of
the
full
value
of
the
stamps.
s&h
contends
on
other
hand
that
the
challenged
actions
are
essential
to
this
successful
conduct
of
its
business
for
the
reasons
previously
stated
and
the
worst
that
could
be
said
with
regard
to
consumers
that
appealed
them.
the
record
does
not
show
how
many
appealed
them.
maybe
inconvenience
by
s&h
actions
and
preventing
of
stamp
traffickers
from
offering
to
purchase
or
redeem
stamps.
i
might
say
the
reason
show
or
the
reason
why
the
record
shows,
no
experience
in
the
matter
of
injury
to
s&h
by
the
activity
of
these
traffickers
is
that
the
courts
over
a
period
of
67
years
have
restrained
the
activity
of
the
exchanges
on
an
unauthorized
redeeming
retailers.
although
there
are
other
defects
in
the
commissions
decision
which
would
preclude
the
affirmance
as
requested
by
petitioner.
there
are
really
two
fundamental
effects
in
petitioner’s
position.
first
is
that
the
commission
did
not
make
findings
of
unfairness
or
inconvenience
to
consumers
which
the
petitioner
alleges
would
support
its
request.
secondly,
if
the
commission
had
made
findings
on
accordance
with
petitioner’s
contentions
even
if
they
had
gone
that
far,
they
did
not.
the
findings
were
not
support
of
conclusion
that
s&h
is
conduct
violated
section
5.
in
short,
the
requested
order,
petitioners
requested
order
would
be
beyond
the
scope
of
section
5
and
upside
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission.
it
has
never
before
been
suggested
that
inconvenience
could
be
a
basis
for
determination
that
section
5
has
been
violated.
the
commission,
in
fact
purported
to
decide
only
an
unfair
competition
case
and
entire
competition
case.
not
an
unfair
to
consumer’s
case.
it
found
that
the
action
of
s&h
in
stopping
unauthorized
trafficking
in
its
stamps
was
an
unfair
method
of
competition.
we
appeal
an
argument
really
made
the
fifth
circuit
foreign
to
any
arguments
which
you
heard
today
but
they
are
to
remain
to
the
basic
issue
before
you
which
was
the
decision
of
the
commission
tracked,
it
should
be
confirmed,
affirmed.
now,
the
errors
which
we
urged
upon
the
fifth
circuit
in
which
are
reasons
why
this
commission
decision
should
not
be
affirmed
or
one,
that
a
most
flagrant
error
of
the
commission
was
that
it
pointedly
ignored
the
43
decisions
of
the
courts
and
8
federal
districts
and
19
states
upholding
unanimously
our
practice
of
proceeding
against
commercial
practices
and
it
likewise
ignored
the
statutes
of
four
states
which
make
trafficking
a
crime.
now,
we
say
that
the
commission
should
have
considered
those
decisions
and
found
them
controlling.
the
petitioner’s
come
a
little
bit
to
our
view
this
morning
and
it
said
that
they
should
be
given
some
weight.
but
on
either
standards,
the
commissions
decision
is
wrong
because
it
did
not
consider
those
decisions
at
all
and
it
pointedly
ignored
them.
secondly,
the
commission
decision
is
an
error
because
it
says
that
the
simple
matter
of
writing
letters
in
good
faith,
followed
up
with
necessary
by
court
action
based
upon
unfair
competition
that
is
a
simple
matter
of
going
to
court
constituted
conduct,
contravening
section
5.
the
third
thing
that
is
wrong
of
this
commission
decision
is
that
the
commission
erroneously
fail
to
consider
that
the
traffickers
themselves
as
determined
by
the
43
court
decisions
in
the
state
statutes
are
engaged
in
unlawful
activity
and
therefore
they
are
not
entitled
to
the
protection
of
section
5.
and
finally
and
this
was
an
egregious
error
in
the
commission
decision.
that
commission
erroneously
ignored
the
effect
of
its
action
on
competition
among
and
between
trading
stamp
companies.
we
said
that
the
commissions
decision
would
make
all
brands
of
stamps
interchangeable
and
would
destroy
trading
stamp
competition.
the
court
of
appeal
agreed
with
this
and
it
as
did
the
commission
considered
the
case
as
one
involving
anticompetitive
practices.
it
pointed
out
that
all
are
fairly
challenged
to
do
so.
the
commission
had
been
unable
to
point
that
any
antitrust
law
which
s&h
has
violated
even
in
letter
and
spirit
and
that
the
efforts
of
s&h
to
prevent
that
which
time
and
time
had
been
declared
unlawful,
did
not
constitute
practices
of
the
type
which
transgresses
the
spirit
of
antitrust
laws.
fifth
circuit
said
that
mere
injury
to
traffickers
was
not
enough
to
establish
violation
of
section
5,
that
the
commission
itself
had
pointed
out
that
trading
stamps
are
involved
on
means
of
competitions
at
the
retail
level
to
come
on
integral
and
important
part
of
retailing
in
america
and
they
went
on
to
agree
with
us
that
the
order
of
the
commission
would
make
all
stamps
interchangeable
and
would
reduce
as
against
other
trading
stamp
companies
the
effectiveness
of
s&h
as
competitive
too.
now,
in
seeking
certiorari,
the
petitioner
presented
two
questions.
one
as
to
whether
the
court
of
appeals
restricted
erroneously
section
5
conduct
which
violates
the
letters,
sphere
of
the
antitrust
laws.
and
secondly,
which
the
petitioner
restated
this
morning
which
was
did
the
commission
err
in
failing
to
give
sufficient
weight
to
decisions
under
state
law.
that
was
as
it
was
presented
this
morning
and
indicated
whether
under
petitioner’s
view
of
that
or
our
view,
the
commission
was
wrong
or
it
did
not
consider
at
all
43
decisions.
now,
in
some
the
petitioners
urging
you
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
commission
upon
the
basis
of
evidence
which
is
not
in
the
record
before
the
commission.
upon
the
basis
of
evidence
not
considered
by
the
commission,
upon
the
basis
of
findings
not
made
by
the
commission
and
upon
the
basis
of
legal
theories
without
support
in
the
legislative
history
of
section
5
are
in
the
decisions
with
the
court
or
in
the
decisions
of
the
commission.
some
of
the
things
that
i
think
that
are
important,
in
this
context
is
petitioners
claim
that
the
commission
found
that
s&h's
activity
in
stopping
traffickers
was
to
the
detriment
of
the
traffickers
and
also
to
the
consuming
public.
now,
therefore
that
the
prejudice
and
injury
of
the
consuming
public.
now,
those
so
called
findings
are
not
findings
in
any
sense
but
are
wholly
naked,
ultimate
conclusions
and
are
in
fact
there
is
simply
mechanical
repetitions
of
the
conclusions
contained
in
the
original
complaint.
they
are
found
on
the
89
or
90
so
called
findings
and
then
the
second
of
a
three
conclusions
and
they
are
preceded
by
no
discussion
of
any
evidence
of
consumer
injury
by
no
mention
of
consumer
injury,
by
no
basic
or
underlying
findings
and
more
importantly
they
found,
they
form
no
basis
for
the
action
of
the
commission.
mr.
harold
l.
russell
yes
sir,
page
126
and
that
those
are
the
ones
that
i
have
just
mentioned
and
actually
petitioner
has
two
fragile
straws
upon
which
it
relies
126
and
176.
mr.
harold
l.
russell
of
the
joint
appendix
one
yes.
mr.
harold
l.
russell
89
and
then
the
second
of
the
three
conclusions
immediately
below
that.
mr.
harold
l.
russell
and
then
176,
you
find
the
second
straw
where
it
is
alleged
and
petitioner
alleges
that
the
commission
adopted
the
examiner's
finding
on
injury
to
consumers.
now
the
commission
did
not
know
such
things
and
first
full
paragraph.
mr.
harold
l.
russell
yes.
excuse
me
sir.
176
first
full
paragraphs
the
last
five
lines.
mr.
harold
l.
russell
right
mr.
harold
l.
russell
that
is
only
referenced
to
consumers
and
it
merely
mentioned
in
passing
and
it
did
not
adopt.
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
pointedly
i
think
refrained
from
adopting
because
the
complaint
counsel
had
asked
for
finding
on
this
subject
that
the
commission
made
non
and
if
you
refer
back
your
honor
to
the
statement
of
the
examiner
and
that
to
which
the
commission
referred
and
it
appears
at
joint
appendix
73.
what
the
examiner
said
was
that
the
stamp
collector
had
less
of
a
choice
than
she
would
have
had
if
she
could
have
used
the
stamps
as
currency
anywhere
she
chose.
now,
he
went
ahead
to
point
out
to
make
the
stamps
equivalent
of
currency
would
be
for
the
commission
to
exercise
its
power
solely
for
the
convenience
consumers
and
he
noted
that
section
5
does
not
give
the
commission
such
power
or
at
the
power
only
to
prevent
unfair
action
practices.
mr.
harold
l.
russell
i
was
reading
at
first
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
excuse
me.
mr.
harold
l.
russell
at
176,
the
commission
referred
and
did
not
adopt
the
finding
of
the
examiner.
mr.
harold
l.
russell
the
examiner's
finding
to
which
it
referred
appears
at
73
and
the
examiners
said
that
the
stamp
saver
did
not
have,
did
not
issue
our
currency
which
of
course
we
could
not
do
because
we
cannot
get
it
whole
sale,
we
cannot
stand
businesses.
we
cannot
buy
materials
whole
sale
that
our
costumer
redeem
in
that
retail
prices
and
furthermore
78
of
the
examiners
decision.
70
records
he
pointed
out
that
this
is
matter
of
mere
convenience
to
the
consumer.
and
at
section
5
does
not
give
commission
the
power
over
mere
convenience.
now
commissions
certain
did
not
adopt
the
findings
of
the
examiner
on
injury
to
consumer.
the
examiner
did
not
find
the
injury
to
the
consumer
and
the
examiner
found
simply
a
matter
of
possible
convenience
to
the
consumer
which
did
not
want
to
exercise
the
commission's
power.
now,
the
big
point
is
that
the
commission
itself
did
not
consider
any
way
to
evidence
as
to
the
fact
of
s&h
actions
upon
consumers
and
since
the
commission
did
not
make
a
determination
of
facts.
a
large
part
of
the
petitioner’s
argument
has
been
taken
up
with
the
request
that
supreme
court
consider
evidence
not
considered
by
the
commission
that
you
make
findings
not
made
by
the
commission.
for
example,
the
petitioner
urges
you
to
find
that
the
cost
of
groceries
is
ordinarily
higher
but
recalls
stamps
are
issued
by
retailers,
when
stamps
are
issued
by
retailer.
now
the
commission
made
no
such
finding.
there
was
not
more
quest
to
do
so
by
complaint
counsel.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
complaint
counsel
asked
the
commission
to
find
that
stamps
reduced
prices.
i
think
it
is
just
absolutely
wrong
for
the
petitioner
to
be
coming
here
and
saying,
find
the
stamps
raised
prices
when
a
contrary
finding
was
asked
to
the
commission,
and
a
matter
of
fact
that
158
your
honors,
the
commission
found
that
stamps
reflect
a
price
reduction.
now,
petitioner
also
asked
you
to
make
a
finding
not
made
by
the
commission
that
under
the
order
a
higher
percentage
of
stamps
would
be
redeemed
and
that
consumers
as
a
whole
would
thereby
get
greater
benefits
from
the
stamps.
now
the
fact
is
that
such
a
finding
was
requested
by
complaint
counsel
before
the
commission
refused
to
make
such
a
finding.
and
the
fact
is
that
the
commission
conceded
that
is
much
as
95%
of
s&h
stamps
are
redeemed
or
maybe
redeemed
and
there
is
no
support
in
the
record,
petitioners
cites
the
assumption
that
a
higher
percentage
would
be
redeemed.
over
an
unchallenged
finding,
the
examiner
stated
that
competition
forces
s&h
to
invest
the
value
of
unredeemed
stamps
and
greater
values
for
savers
and
licensees.
and
your
honor,
the
unredeemed
stamps
of
which
petitioner
spoke
amounted
to
14%
of
those
outstanding
which
were
almost
precisely
the
same
in
number
as
those
issued
in
the
preceding
year
and
the
record
shows
that
there
is
a
year
lag
between
the
issuance
and
redemption.
as
a
matter
of
fact
13%
were
issued
in
the
year
1964.
the
last
year
involved
in
this
compilation
and
here
we
have
a
situation
where
95%
of
the
people
are
getting
a
$3
redemption
value
for
$2.68
cents
cost
to
the
retailer.
we
have
a
situation
where
we
had
seven
consumer
witnesses
out
of
35
million
households
who
save
s&h
stamps,
we
have
a
situation
where
even
those
seven
consumer
witnesses
did
not
complain
about
s&h
practices,
where
a
situation
which
they
say
that
the
most
is
more
convenient
sometimes
for
them
to
use
the
trading
stamp
exchange
than
it
is
to
redeem
their
stamps.
now,
the
petitioner
asked
you
to
make
other
findings
not
made
by
the
commission.
such
as
this
business
about
the
man
who
owns
no
cart
and
not
get
to
the
redemption
center
but
the
examiner
found
and
it
would
not
dispute
it
that
even
if
a
man
as
within
the
25
mile
range
of
a
redemption
center
which
is
inconvenient
for
them
to
get
to
the
center.
he
can
and
does
redeem
by
mail.
that
appears
at
pages
39
and
46
at
the
record
before
you,
i
could
go
on
on
others
things.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
last
night,
i
did
a
compilation
from
the
respondent’s
briefs
and
i
found
that
they
have
asked
you
at
least
50
times
to
consider
smatterings
of
evidence
not
considered
by
the
commission
and
they
have
asked
you
at
least
six
or
eight
times
such
as
in
this
matter
of
effect
on
price.
this
matter
of
greater
number
redemptions
to
make
findings
which
they
recognize
are
essential
to
their
position
and
which
the
commission
itself
did
not
make.
mr.
harold
l.
russell
that
is
correct
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
no
part
of
this
treatment
of
count
three
was
involved
with
that
aspect
of
the
trading
stamp.
mr.
harold
l.
russell
and
i
believe
it
is
right.
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
am
sure
it
is
right.
now,
i
would
like
to
go
on
to
the
legal
question
which
is
before
you
and
that
is
that
petitioner
says
he
has
asked
this
court
to
answer
the
question
whether
section
5
is
limited
to
conduct
which
violates
the
letter's
sphere
of
antitrust
law.
now,
on
this
question
is
has
no
difference
between
the
parties.
obviously
section
5
is
not
so
limited
since
its
enactment
section
5
has
been
held
a
black
not
only
to
antitrust
like
conduct
but
also
the
deceptive
practices
and
other
forms
of
unfair
conduct.
the
real
question
before
the
court
is
how
far
can
the
commission
go
in
holding
a
practice
which
is
not
deceptive
or
in
the
nature
of
an
unfair,
of
antitrust
violation
to
be
unfair.
are
there
any
limits
at
all
that
the
commission
have
unrestricted
of
authority
to
condemned
practices
simply
because
it
is
of
the
opinion
that
they
are
not
beneficial
to
add
beneficial
consumers
as
some
modification
might
be.
now,
when
section
5
was
originally
enacted,
many
were
afraid
that
the
language
of
a
statute
was
too
broad
and
in
congressional
debates,
the
daughters
were
reassured
that
unfairness
of
the
competition
actually
had
some
limitations.
and
it
was
even
said
that
the
practice
is
covered
or
to
be
limit
of
those
which
shock
the
universal
conscience
of
mankind.
now
it
is
more
than
interesting
to
note.
your
honor
that
one
of
the
unfair
practices
referred
to
in
the
debates.
as
being
an
unfair
practices
was
that
of
inducing
savers
of
s&h
stamps
to
fill
an
trade
their
unfilled
books
of
s&h
stamps
for
the
stamps
of
another
company.
that
was
a
reference
for
the
case
of
s&h
versus
louie
weber
and
under
the
commission's
order
in
this
case
we
could
not
bring
that
case
which
we
brought
in
1908
and
which
congress
said
represented
the
type
of
unfair
competition,
unfair
practice
case
with
section
5
was
suppose
to
cover.
mr.
harold
l.
russell
that
is
a
case
of
s&h
versus
louis
weber,
a
federal
district
court
case
in
1908
and
which
it
was
held
that
s&h,
i
mean
s&h
got
in
injunction
against
this
rascal
who
was
swapping
his
stamps
for
s&h
stamps
and
that
were
to
some
and
substance
of
it
although
petitioner
attempts
a
wholly
and
adequate
distinction
of
the
matter
in
which
he
says
that
first
that
this
rascal
was
selling
these
stamps
back
to
our
licensees.
the
court
said,
it
does
not
appear
that
happened
very
much
but
the
point
is
that
under
this
commission
order,
this
rascal
could
sell
these
stamps
back
to
our
licensees.
is
that
the
order
runs
on
against
re-issuance
but
non
licensees,
it
is
not
our
licensee.
so
it
would
be
completely
powerless
to
prevent
what
the
congress
thought
was
an
unfair
method
of
the
competition.
mr.
harold
l.
russell
louis
weber
mr.
harold
l.
russell
exactly,
exactly
your
honor.
he
referred
to
that
as
an
unfair
competitive
practice
and
unfair
trade
practice.
mr.
harold
l.
russell
he
was
the
competing
stamps
company.
now
the
broadest
interpretation
of
the
commission's
power
as
i
believe
could
be
found
in
its
report
on
cigarette
advertising
and
labeling
in
which
to
come
right
to
the
point
insofar
as
we
are
concerned.
the
commission
said
that
something
would
be
unfair
and
unfair
or
deceptive
act
or
practices
if
in
addition
to
be
morally
objectionable.
it
is
seriously
detrimental
to
consumers
or
others.
now,
under
no
stretch,
the
imagination
could
have
be
said
that
our
challenged
actions
violate
that
kind
of
standard.
the
principal
argument
of
the
petitioner
is
that
we
have
been
unfair
to
consumers
and
petitioner
argues
about
raising
the
cost
of
goods,
or
the
prices
of
the
groceries
and
that
the
matters
of
greater
redemption
which
as
we
pointed
out
for
findings
of
commission
did
not
make
at
all
in
which
the
petitioner
would
have
view
like
--
now,
the
basic
question
is,
is
it
unfair
for
s&h
not
to
offer
the
conveniences
if
there
are
any
such
of
the
trading
stamp
exchange,
unauthorized
redeeming
retailers
which
have
some
cost.
you
heard
this
morning
about
paying
a
dollar-and-a-half
for
a
book
of
stamps
which
is
worth
$3.00.
one
of
these
trading
stamps
exchange
operators
testified
his
principal
part
of
his
business
came
from
door
to
door
salesman
who
went
around
selling
bibles
and
photos
and
they
took
s&h
trading
stamp
books
from
the
unsuspecting
housewife
and
then
took
on
the
rosenwasser
and
whose
give
him
a
dollar-and-a-half
book
form
and
then
rosenwasser
went
to
s&h
and
got
tv
sets
which
rosenwasser
was
able
to
sell
to
the
tv
store
down
the
street
for
stock
and
trade.
now
this
is
a
principal
part
of
this
rascal’s
business
but
this
is
a
kind
of
thing
which
petitioner
would
have
you
protect.
if
it
has
been
on
a
overreaching
of
the
consumer
at
the
consumer
level,
it
is
done
by
trading
stamp
exchanges
and
not
by
s&h.
now,
is
it
unfair
for
s&h
to
prevent
that
kind
of
practice?
certainly,
it
does
not
seem
so
to
me
and
the
restrictions
which
do
not,
the
restrictions
on
transfer
ability
which
do
not
put
a
substantial
burden
upon
the
consumer
are
justified
in
this
particular
case
without
question.
now--
mr.
harold
l.
russell
yes
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
harold
l.
russell
all
we
want
to
do
is
to
be
able
unilaterally
and
all
by
ourselves
to
go
to
court,
to
stamp
out
unfair
competition
as
we
have
done
for
the
75
years
of
our
company’s
existence.
now,
in
conclusion,
i
come
back
to
the
request
of
the
petitioner.
this
court
affirmed
the
commission's
decision
and
gave
you
the
reasons
why
it
would
be
grossly
inappropriate
for
the
court
to
take
that
action.
not
to
be
repetitive
but
the
commission
pointedly
ignored
the
43
decisions.
the
commission
erred
in
saying
when
we
wrote
letters
in
a
good
faith
and
brought
litigation
in
good
faith
we
were
transgressing
section
5.
the
commission
erred
in
failing
to
consider
that
the
traffickers
themselves
are
engaged
in
unlawful
activity
and
therefore
entitled
to
no
protection
under
section
5.
the
commission
erred
in
over
ruling
its
hearing
examiner
and
holding
that
s&h
is
not
harmed
by
unauthorized
trafficking
in
their
stamps.
it
erred
in
ignoring
the
fact
that
its
action
would
destroy
competition
among
and
between
the
trading
stamp
companies.
as
petitioner
appears
to
concede
by
its
argument
here,
the
decision
can
not
be
affirmed
unless
the
supreme
court
of
united
states
made
factual
findings
on
injury
to
consumers
not
made
by
the
commission
and
more
importantly
as
petitioner
appears
to
concede
that
an
order
can
not
be
affirmed
unless
you
conclude
contrary
to
all
authority
and
contrary
to
the
commission's
broadest
interpretation
of
its
jurisdiction
under
section
5
that
inconvenience
to
consumers
constitutes
the
violation
of
that
section.
now,
finally
and
i
believe,
also
importantly,
the
commission's
action
could
not
be
affirmed
upon
the
basis
not
relied
upon
by
the
commission,
namely
alleged
harm
to
consumers.
a
factor
which
has
been
stated
by
you
in
burlington,chenery
lately
an
investment
company,
that
the
order
may
not
be
affirmed
upon
the
basis
of
appellate
counsel's
post
rationalizations.
now,
the
commission
is
here
your
honors
is
in
my
view,
only
because
it
is
seeking
a
sweeping
exposition
of
its
powers
in
the
consumers
field
and
must
be
obvious
to
you
i
hope,
that
these
case
which
was
instituted
at
1965,
six
years
ago
today,
and
tried
in
1966
before
this
commission
became
so
acutely
consumer
conscience
that
this
case
is
only
in
actuality
(inaudible)
of
a
case
out
of
which
the
commissions
desire
that
first
decision
can
not
be
made.
the
commission
had
never
found
that
this
matter
of
injury
to
consumers
even
initially
justified
that
institution
of
the
proceeding.
as
you
heard
this
morning,
there
were
three
counts.
this
count
although
of
great
importance
to
us,
was
a
small
tail
on
a
large
dog.
the
commission
was
primarily
concerned
with
1:10
was
a
conspiracy
with
respect
to
1:10
and
it
would
be
to
me
shocking
that
this
act
or
thought,
bowl
or
plate
pranked
in
mechanical
reproduction
of
the
complaint
as
to
consumer
injury.
without
discussion
of
the
facts
of
consumer
injury
could
be
found
to
support
this
decision
of
the
commission
and
even
if
we
took
the
case
to
the
point
where
petitioner,
i
think
ended
when
he
was
questioned
this
morning
that
the
commission's
decision
should
be
affirmed
because
anti-competitive
problems
as
well
as
consumers
problems.
you
recall
that
when
the
commission
relies
upon
several
factors
and
put
some
into
conjunctive
and
one
falls
they
all
falls.
on
the
matter
of
injury
to
competition,
the
fifth
circuit
was
entirely
right
and
the
petitioners
pointed
out
no
reasons
why
in
this
anticompetitive
aspect
of
the
case,
the
fifth
circuit
should
be
reversed.
mr.
harold
l.
russell
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
i
would
like
to
note
that
actually
the
only
paragraph
of
the
order
with
which
we
are
concerned
is
paragraph
5
which
appears
at
pages
127,
128
of
joint
appendix.
all
we
want
to
do
is
to
be
able
as
i
have
said
unilaterally
and
all
by
our
selves
to
go
to
court
as
we
have
done
for
75
years
to
protect
the
quality
and
integrity
of
our
stamp
business
by
stopping
unauthorized
trafficking
in
stamps.
s&h
is
in
the
business
of
licensing
retail
merchants
to
use
its
sales
promotion
system
which
is
based
upon
the
use
of
s&h
trading
stamps.
retail
merchants
subscribe
to
that
service
to
increase
trade
and
to
maintain
and
enhance
customer
loyalty.
they
use
stamps
to
get
their
customers
to
return
to
their
stores
again
and
again
until
they
have
collected
enough
stamps
to
secure
redemption
merchandise
of
their
choice.
throughout
the
history
of
this
company,
non
licensed
retailers,
stamps
exchangers
have
attempted
to
cash
in
on
the
s&h
system
without
paying
for
the
s&h
service.
by
purchasing,
exchanging
and
making
other
commercial
use
of
s&h
stamps
without
s&h
authorization.
now
the
reason
we
have
consistently
sought
judicial
relief
and
the
reason
why
the
courts
have
enjoined
it.
is
that
if
competing
merchants
were
free
to
redeem
s&h
stamps
issued
by
s&h
licensees
for
their
own
merchandise
or
they
could
exchange
s&h
stamps
for
their
own
stamps
or
the
consumers
could
get
stamps
of
trading
stamps
exchanges
rather
than
as
a
licensee.
the
s&h
system
had
lost
its
attraction
for
the
licensees
to
after
all
of
the
people
who
pay
s&h
for
the
use
of
its
service.
in
fact,
in
the
case
of
unauthorized
redeeming
retailer,
the
s&h
system
could
be
turned
into
an
instrument
to
introduce
the
s&h
licensee’s
customers
to
the
store
of
a
non
licensed
competitor.
this
is
a
basic
reason
why
the
court
of
equity
has
consistently
granted
judicial
relief
to
s&h
against
unauthorized
traffickers.
holding
at
these
traffickers
have
been
engaged
in
unfair
competition
and
tortuous
interference
with
s&h
contractual
and
business
relations.
the
central
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
s&h
actions
in
preventing
the
unauthorized
commercial
use
of
its
trading
stamps
by
obtaining
judicial
relief
against
the
abuse
constitutes
an
unfair
practice
violating
section
5.
the
petitioner’s
main
argument
is
that
s&h
actions
violate
section
5
and
that
because
of
the
court
restraints.
s&h
stamps
savers
do
not
have
complete
freedom
of
choice
in
the
transfer
of
their
stamps.
this
is
alleged
to
be
unfair
to
consumers
who
are
said
thereby
to
be
deprived
of
the
full
value
of
the
stamps.
s&h
contends
on
other
hand
that
the
challenged
actions
are
essential
to
this
successful
conduct
of
its
business
for
the
reasons
previously
stated
and
the
worst
that
could
be
said
with
regard
to
consumers
that
appealed
them.
the
record
does
not
show
how
many
appealed
them.
maybe
inconvenience
by
s&h
actions
and
preventing
of
stamp
traffickers
from
offering
to
purchase
or
redeem
stamps.
i
might
say
the
reason
show
or
the
reason
why
the
record
shows,
no
experience
in
the
matter
of
injury
to
s&h
by
the
activity
of
these
traffickers
is
that
the
courts
over
a
period
of
67
years
have
restrained
the
activity
of
the
exchanges
on
an
unauthorized
redeeming
retailers.
although
there
are
other
defects
in
the
commissions
decision
which
would
preclude
the
affirmance
as
requested
by
petitioner.
there
are
really
two
fundamental
effects
in
petitioner’s
position.
first
is
that
the
commission
did
not
make
findings
of
unfairness
or
inconvenience
to
consumers
which
the
petitioner
alleges
would
support
its
request.
secondly,
if
the
commission
had
made
findings
on
accordance
with
petitioner’s
contentions
even
if
they
had
gone
that
far,
they
did
not.
the
findings
were
not
support
of
conclusion
that
s&h
is
conduct
violated
section
5.
in
short,
the
requested
order,
petitioners
requested
order
would
be
beyond
the
scope
of
section
5
and
upside
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission.
it
has
never
before
been
suggested
that
inconvenience
could
be
a
basis
for
determination
that
section
5
has
been
violated.
the
commission,
in
fact
purported
to
decide
only
an
unfair
competition
case
and
entire
competition
case.
not
an
unfair
to
consumer’s
case.
it
found
that
the
action
of
s&h
in
stopping
unauthorized
trafficking
in
its
stamps
was
an
unfair
method
of
competition.
we
appeal
an
argument
really
made
the
fifth
circuit
foreign
to
any
arguments
which
you
heard
today
but
they
are
to
remain
to
the
basic
issue
before
you
which
was
the
decision
of
the
commission
tracked,
it
should
be
confirmed,
affirmed.
now,
the
errors
which
we
urged
upon
the
fifth
circuit
in
which
are
reasons
why
this
commission
decision
should
not
be
affirmed
or
one,
that
a
most
flagrant
error
of
the
commission
was
that
it
pointedly
ignored
the
43
decisions
of
the
courts
and
8
federal
districts
and
19
states
upholding
unanimously
our
practice
of
proceeding
against
commercial
practices
and
it
likewise
ignored
the
statutes
of
four
states
which
make
trafficking
a
crime.
now,
we
say
that
the
commission
should
have
considered
those
decisions
and
found
them
controlling.
the
petitioner’s
come
a
little
bit
to
our
view
this
morning
and
it
said
that
they
should
be
given
some
weight.
but
on
either
standards,
the
commissions
decision
is
wrong
because
it
did
not
consider
those
decisions
at
all
and
it
pointedly
ignored
them.
secondly,
the
commission
decision
is
an
error
because
it
says
that
the
simple
matter
of
writing
letters
in
good
faith,
followed
up
with
necessary
by
court
action
based
upon
unfair
competition
that
is
a
simple
matter
of
going
to
court
constituted
conduct,
contravening
section
5.
the
third
thing
that
is
wrong
of
this
commission
decision
is
that
the
commission
erroneously
fail
to
consider
that
the
traffickers
themselves
as
determined
by
the
43
court
decisions
in
the
state
statutes
are
engaged
in
unlawful
activity
and
therefore
they
are
not
entitled
to
the
protection
of
section
5.
and
finally
and
this
was
an
egregious
error
in
the
commission
decision.
that
commission
erroneously
ignored
the
effect
of
its
action
on
competition
among
and
between
trading
stamp
companies.
we
said
that
the
commissions
decision
would
make
all
brands
of
stamps
interchangeable
and
would
destroy
trading
stamp
competition.
the
court
of
appeal
agreed
with
this
and
it
as
did
the
commission
considered
the
case
as
one
involving
anticompetitive
practices.
it
pointed
out
that
all
are
fairly
challenged
to
do
so.
the
commission
had
been
unable
to
point
that
any
antitrust
law
which
s&h
has
violated
even
in
letter
and
spirit
and
that
the
efforts
of
s&h
to
prevent
that
which
time
and
time
had
been
declared
unlawful,
did
not
constitute
practices
of
the
type
which
transgresses
the
spirit
of
antitrust
laws.
fifth
circuit
said
that
mere
injury
to
traffickers
was
not
enough
to
establish
violation
of
section
5,
that
the
commission
itself
had
pointed
out
that
trading
stamps
are
involved
on
means
of
competitions
at
the
retail
level
to
come
on
integral
and
important
part
of
retailing
in
america
and
they
went
on
to
agree
with
us
that
the
order
of
the
commission
would
make
all
stamps
interchangeable
and
would
reduce
as
against
other
trading
stamp
companies
the
effectiveness
of
s&h
as
competitive
too.
now,
in
seeking
certiorari,
the
petitioner
presented
two
questions.
one
as
to
whether
the
court
of
appeals
restricted
erroneously
section
5
conduct
which
violates
the
letters,
sphere
of
the
antitrust
laws.
and
secondly,
which
the
petitioner
restated
this
morning
which
was
did
the
commission
err
in
failing
to
give
sufficient
weight
to
decisions
under
state
law.
that
was
as
it
was
presented
this
morning
and
indicated
whether
under
petitioner’s
view
of
that
or
our
view,
the
commission
was
wrong
or
it
did
not
consider
at
all
43
decisions.
now,
in
some
the
petitioners
urging
you
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
commission
upon
the
basis
of
evidence
which
is
not
in
the
record
before
the
commission.
upon
the
basis
of
evidence
not
considered
by
the
commission,
upon
the
basis
of
findings
not
made
by
the
commission
and
upon
the
basis
of
legal
theories
without
support
in
the
legislative
history
of
section
5
are
in
the
decisions
with
the
court
or
in
the
decisions
of
the
commission.
some
of
the
things
that
i
think
that
are
important,
in
this
context
is
petitioners
claim
that
the
commission
found
that
s&h's
activity
in
stopping
traffickers
was
to
the
detriment
of
the
traffickers
and
also
to
the
consuming
public.
now,
therefore
that
the
prejudice
and
injury
of
the
consuming
public.
now,
those
so
called
findings
are
not
findings
in
any
sense
but
are
wholly
naked,
ultimate
conclusions
and
are
in
fact
there
is
simply
mechanical
repetitions
of
the
conclusions
contained
in
the
original
complaint.
they
are
found
on
the
89
or
90
so
called
findings
and
then
the
second
of
a
three
conclusions
and
they
are
preceded
by
no
discussion
of
any
evidence
of
consumer
injury
by
no
mention
of
consumer
injury,
by
no
basic
or
underlying
findings
and
more
importantly
they
found,
they
form
no
basis
for
the
action
of
the
commission.
mr.
harold
l.
russell
yes
sir,
page
126
and
that
those
are
the
ones
that
i
have
just
mentioned
and
actually
petitioner
has
two
fragile
straws
upon
which
it
relies
126
and
176.
mr.
harold
l.
russell
of
the
joint
appendix
one
yes.
mr.
harold
l.
russell
89
and
then
the
second
of
the
three
conclusions
immediately
below
that.
mr.
harold
l.
russell
and
then
176,
you
find
the
second
straw
where
it
is
alleged
and
petitioner
alleges
that
the
commission
adopted
the
examiner's
finding
on
injury
to
consumers.
now
the
commission
did
not
know
such
things
and
first
full
paragraph.
mr.
harold
l.
russell
yes.
excuse
me
sir.
176
first
full
paragraphs
the
last
five
lines.
mr.
harold
l.
russell
right
mr.
harold
l.
russell
that
is
only
referenced
to
consumers
and
it
merely
mentioned
in
passing
and
it
did
not
adopt.
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
pointedly
i
think
refrained
from
adopting
because
the
complaint
counsel
had
asked
for
finding
on
this
subject
that
the
commission
made
non
and
if
you
refer
back
your
honor
to
the
statement
of
the
examiner
and
that
to
which
the
commission
referred
and
it
appears
at
joint
appendix
73.
what
the
examiner
said
was
that
the
stamp
collector
had
less
of
a
choice
than
she
would
have
had
if
she
could
have
used
the
stamps
as
currency
anywhere
she
chose.
now,
he
went
ahead
to
point
out
to
make
the
stamps
equivalent
of
currency
would
be
for
the
commission
to
exercise
its
power
solely
for
the
convenience
consumers
and
he
noted
that
section
5
does
not
give
the
commission
such
power
or
at
the
power
only
to
prevent
unfair
action
practices.
mr.
harold
l.
russell
i
was
reading
at
first
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
excuse
me.
mr.
harold
l.
russell
at
176,
the
commission
referred
and
did
not
adopt
the
finding
of
the
examiner.
mr.
harold
l.
russell
the
examiner's
finding
to
which
it
referred
appears
at
73
and
the
examiners
said
that
the
stamp
saver
did
not
have,
did
not
issue
our
currency
which
of
course
we
could
not
do
because
we
cannot
get
it
whole
sale,
we
cannot
stand
businesses.
we
cannot
buy
materials
whole
sale
that
our
costumer
redeem
in
that
retail
prices
and
furthermore
78
of
the
examiners
decision.
70
records
he
pointed
out
that
this
is
matter
of
mere
convenience
to
the
consumer.
and
at
section
5
does
not
give
commission
the
power
over
mere
convenience.
now
commissions
certain
did
not
adopt
the
findings
of
the
examiner
on
injury
to
consumer.
the
examiner
did
not
find
the
injury
to
the
consumer
and
the
examiner
found
simply
a
matter
of
possible
convenience
to
the
consumer
which
did
not
want
to
exercise
the
commission's
power.
now,
the
big
point
is
that
the
commission
itself
did
not
consider
any
way
to
evidence
as
to
the
fact
of
s&h
actions
upon
consumers
and
since
the
commission
did
not
make
a
determination
of
facts.
a
large
part
of
the
petitioner’s
argument
has
been
taken
up
with
the
request
that
supreme
court
consider
evidence
not
considered
by
the
commission
that
you
make
findings
not
made
by
the
commission.
for
example,
the
petitioner
urges
you
to
find
that
the
cost
of
groceries
is
ordinarily
higher
but
recalls
stamps
are
issued
by
retailers,
when
stamps
are
issued
by
retailer.
now
the
commission
made
no
such
finding.
there
was
not
more
quest
to
do
so
by
complaint
counsel.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
complaint
counsel
asked
the
commission
to
find
that
stamps
reduced
prices.
i
think
it
is
just
absolutely
wrong
for
the
petitioner
to
be
coming
here
and
saying,
find
the
stamps
raised
prices
when
a
contrary
finding
was
asked
to
the
commission,
and
a
matter
of
fact
that
158
your
honors,
the
commission
found
that
stamps
reflect
a
price
reduction.
now,
petitioner
also
asked
you
to
make
a
finding
not
made
by
the
commission
that
under
the
order
a
higher
percentage
of
stamps
would
be
redeemed
and
that
consumers
as
a
whole
would
thereby
get
greater
benefits
from
the
stamps.
now
the
fact
is
that
such
a
finding
was
requested
by
complaint
counsel
before
the
commission
refused
to
make
such
a
finding.
and
the
fact
is
that
the
commission
conceded
that
is
much
as
95%
of
s&h
stamps
are
redeemed
or
maybe
redeemed
and
there
is
no
support
in
the
record,
petitioners
cites
the
assumption
that
a
higher
percentage
would
be
redeemed.
over
an
unchallenged
finding,
the
examiner
stated
that
competition
forces
s&h
to
invest
the
value
of
unredeemed
stamps
and
greater
values
for
savers
and
licensees.
and
your
honor,
the
unredeemed
stamps
of
which
petitioner
spoke
amounted
to
14%
of
those
outstanding
which
were
almost
precisely
the
same
in
number
as
those
issued
in
the
preceding
year
and
the
record
shows
that
there
is
a
year
lag
between
the
issuance
and
redemption.
as
a
matter
of
fact
13%
were
issued
in
the
year
1964.
the
last
year
involved
in
this
compilation
and
here
we
have
a
situation
where
95%
of
the
people
are
getting
a
$3
redemption
value
for
$2.68
cents
cost
to
the
retailer.
we
have
a
situation
where
we
had
seven
consumer
witnesses
out
of
35
million
households
who
save
s&h
stamps,
we
have
a
situation
where
even
those
seven
consumer
witnesses
did
not
complain
about
s&h
practices,
where
a
situation
which
they
say
that
the
most
is
more
convenient
sometimes
for
them
to
use
the
trading
stamp
exchange
than
it
is
to
redeem
their
stamps.
now,
the
petitioner
asked
you
to
make
other
findings
not
made
by
the
commission.
such
as
this
business
about
the
man
who
owns
no
cart
and
not
get
to
the
redemption
center
but
the
examiner
found
and
it
would
not
dispute
it
that
even
if
a
man
as
within
the
25
mile
range
of
a
redemption
center
which
is
inconvenient
for
them
to
get
to
the
center.
he
can
and
does
redeem
by
mail.
that
appears
at
pages
39
and
46
at
the
record
before
you,
i
could
go
on
on
others
things.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
last
night,
i
did
a
compilation
from
the
respondent’s
briefs
and
i
found
that
they
have
asked
you
at
least
50
times
to
consider
smatterings
of
evidence
not
considered
by
the
commission
and
they
have
asked
you
at
least
six
or
eight
times
such
as
in
this
matter
of
effect
on
price.
this
matter
of
greater
number
redemptions
to
make
findings
which
they
recognize
are
essential
to
their
position
and
which
the
commission
itself
did
not
make.
mr.
harold
l.
russell
that
is
correct
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
no
part
of
this
treatment
of
count
three
was
involved
with
that
aspect
of
the
trading
stamp.
mr.
harold
l.
russell
and
i
believe
it
is
right.
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
am
sure
it
is
right.
now,
i
would
like
to
go
on
to
the
legal
question
which
is
before
you
and
that
is
that
petitioner
says
he
has
asked
this
court
to
answer
the
question
whether
section
5
is
limited
to
conduct
which
violates
the
letter's
sphere
of
antitrust
law.
now,
on
this
question
is
has
no
difference
between
the
parties.
obviously
section
5
is
not
so
limited
since
its
enactment
section
5
has
been
held
a
black
not
only
to
antitrust
like
conduct
but
also
the
deceptive
practices
and
other
forms
of
unfair
conduct.
the
real
question
before
the
court
is
how
far
can
the
commission
go
in
holding
a
practice
which
is
not
deceptive
or
in
the
nature
of
an
unfair,
of
antitrust
violation
to
be
unfair.
are
there
any
limits
at
all
that
the
commission
have
unrestricted
of
authority
to
condemned
practices
simply
because
it
is
of
the
opinion
that
they
are
not
beneficial
to
add
beneficial
consumers
as
some
modification
might
be.
now,
when
section
5
was
originally
enacted,
many
were
afraid
that
the
language
of
a
statute
was
too
broad
and
in
congressional
debates,
the
daughters
were
reassured
that
unfairness
of
the
competition
actually
had
some
limitations.
and
it
was
even
said
that
the
practice
is
covered
or
to
be
limit
of
those
which
shock
the
universal
conscience
of
mankind.
now
it
is
more
than
interesting
to
note.
your
honor
that
one
of
the
unfair
practices
referred
to
in
the
debates.
as
being
an
unfair
practices
was
that
of
inducing
savers
of
s&h
stamps
to
fill
an
trade
their
unfilled
books
of
s&h
stamps
for
the
stamps
of
another
company.
that
was
a
reference
for
the
case
of
s&h
versus
louie
weber
and
under
the
commission's
order
in
this
case
we
could
not
bring
that
case
which
we
brought
in
1908
and
which
congress
said
represented
the
type
of
unfair
competition,
unfair
practice
case
with
section
5
was
suppose
to
cover.
mr.
harold
l.
russell
that
is
a
case
of
s&h
versus
louis
weber,
a
federal
district
court
case
in
1908
and
which
it
was
held
that
s&h,
i
mean
s&h
got
in
injunction
against
this
rascal
who
was
swapping
his
stamps
for
s&h
stamps
and
that
were
to
some
and
substance
of
it
although
petitioner
attempts
a
wholly
and
adequate
distinction
of
the
matter
in
which
he
says
that
first
that
this
rascal
was
selling
these
stamps
back
to
our
licensees.
the
court
said,
it
does
not
appear
that
happened
very
much
but
the
point
is
that
under
this
commission
order,
this
rascal
could
sell
these
stamps
back
to
our
licensees.
is
that
the
order
runs
on
against
re-issuance
but
non
licensees,
it
is
not
our
licensee.
so
it
would
be
completely
powerless
to
prevent
what
the
congress
thought
was
an
unfair
method
of
the
competition.
mr.
harold
l.
russell
louis
weber
mr.
harold
l.
russell
exactly,
exactly
your
honor.
he
referred
to
that
as
an
unfair
competitive
practice
and
unfair
trade
practice.
mr.
harold
l.
russell
he
was
the
competing
stamps
company.
now
the
broadest
interpretation
of
the
commission's
power
as
i
believe
could
be
found
in
its
report
on
cigarette
advertising
and
labeling
in
which
to
come
right
to
the
point
insofar
as
we
are
concerned.
the
commission
said
that
something
would
be
unfair
and
unfair
or
deceptive
act
or
practices
if
in
addition
to
be
morally
objectionable.
it
is
seriously
detrimental
to
consumers
or
others.
now,
under
no
stretch,
the
imagination
could
have
be
said
that
our
challenged
actions
violate
that
kind
of
standard.
the
principal
argument
of
the
petitioner
is
that
we
have
been
unfair
to
consumers
and
petitioner
argues
about
raising
the
cost
of
goods,
or
the
prices
of
the
groceries
and
that
the
matters
of
greater
redemption
which
as
we
pointed
out
for
findings
of
commission
did
not
make
at
all
in
which
the
petitioner
would
have
view
like
--
now,
the
basic
question
is,
is
it
unfair
for
s&h
not
to
offer
the
conveniences
if
there
are
any
such
of
the
trading
stamp
exchange,
unauthorized
redeeming
retailers
which
have
some
cost.
you
heard
this
morning
about
paying
a
dollar-and-a-half
for
a
book
of
stamps
which
is
worth
$3.00.
one
of
these
trading
stamps
exchange
operators
testified
his
principal
part
of
his
business
came
from
door
to
door
salesman
who
went
around
selling
bibles
and
photos
and
they
took
s&h
trading
stamp
books
from
the
unsuspecting
housewife
and
then
took
on
the
rosenwasser
and
whose
give
him
a
dollar-and-a-half
book
form
and
then
rosenwasser
went
to
s&h
and
got
tv
sets
which
rosenwasser
was
able
to
sell
to
the
tv
store
down
the
street
for
stock
and
trade.
now
this
is
a
principal
part
of
this
rascal’s
business
but
this
is
a
kind
of
thing
which
petitioner
would
have
you
protect.
if
it
has
been
on
a
overreaching
of
the
consumer
at
the
consumer
level,
it
is
done
by
trading
stamp
exchanges
and
not
by
s&h.
now,
is
it
unfair
for
s&h
to
prevent
that
kind
of
practice?
certainly,
it
does
not
seem
so
to
me
and
the
restrictions
which
do
not,
the
restrictions
on
transfer
ability
which
do
not
put
a
substantial
burden
upon
the
consumer
are
justified
in
this
particular
case
without
question.
now--
mr.
harold
l.
russell
yes
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
harold
l.
russell
all
we
want
to
do
is
to
be
able
unilaterally
and
all
by
ourselves
to
go
to
court,
to
stamp
out
unfair
competition
as
we
have
done
for
the
75
years
of
our
company’s
existence.
now,
in
conclusion,
i
come
back
to
the
request
of
the
petitioner.
this
court
affirmed
the
commission's
decision
and
gave
you
the
reasons
why
it
would
be
grossly
inappropriate
for
the
court
to
take
that
action.
not
to
be
repetitive
but
the
commission
pointedly
ignored
the
43
decisions.
the
commission
erred
in
saying
when
we
wrote
letters
in
a
good
faith
and
brought
litigation
in
good
faith
we
were
transgressing
section
5.
the
commission
erred
in
failing
to
consider
that
the
traffickers
themselves
are
engaged
in
unlawful
activity
and
therefore
entitled
to
no
protection
under
section
5.
the
commission
erred
in
over
ruling
its
hearing
examiner
and
holding
that
s&h
is
not
harmed
by
unauthorized
trafficking
in
their
stamps.
it
erred
in
ignoring
the
fact
that
its
action
would
destroy
competition
among
and
between
the
trading
stamp
companies.
as
petitioner
appears
to
concede
by
its
argument
here,
the
decision
can
not
be
affirmed
unless
the
supreme
court
of
united
states
made
factual
findings
on
injury
to
consumers
not
made
by
the
commission
and
more
importantly
as
petitioner
appears
to
concede
that
an
order
can
not
be
affirmed
unless
you
conclude
contrary
to
all
authority
and
contrary
to
the
commission's
broadest
interpretation
of
its
jurisdiction
under
section
5
that
inconvenience
to
consumers
constitutes
the
violation
of
that
section.
now,
finally
and
i
believe,
also
importantly,
the
commission's
action
could
not
be
affirmed
upon
the
basis
not
relied
upon
by
the
commission,
namely
alleged
harm
to
consumers.
a
factor
which
has
been
stated
by
you
in
burlington,chenery
lately
an
investment
company,
that
the
order
may
not
be
affirmed
upon
the
basis
of
appellate
counsel's
post
rationalizations.
now,
the
commission
is
here
your
honors
is
in
my
view,
only
because
it
is
seeking
a
sweeping
exposition
of
its
powers
in
the
consumers
field
and
must
be
obvious
to
you
i
hope,
that
these
case
which
was
instituted
at
1965,
six
years
ago
today,
and
tried
in
1966
before
this
commission
became
so
acutely
consumer
conscience
that
this
case
is
only
in
actuality
(inaudible)
of
a
case
out
of
which
the
commissions
desire
that
first
decision
can
not
be
made.
the
commission
had
never
found
that
this
matter
of
injury
to
consumers
even
initially
justified
that
institution
of
the
proceeding.
as
you
heard
this
morning,
there
were
three
counts.
this
count
although
of
great
importance
to
us,
was
a
small
tail
on
a
large
dog.
the
commission
was
primarily
concerned
with
1:10
was
a
conspiracy
with
respect
to
1:10
and
it
would
be
to
me
shocking
that
this
act
or
thought,
bowl
or
plate
pranked
in
mechanical
reproduction
of
the
complaint
as
to
consumer
injury.
without
discussion
of
the
facts
of
consumer
injury
could
be
found
to
support
this
decision
of
the
commission
and
even
if
we
took
the
case
to
the
point
where
petitioner,
i
think
ended
when
he
was
questioned
this
morning
that
the
commission's
decision
should
be
affirmed
because
anti-competitive
problems
as
well
as
consumers
problems.
you
recall
that
when
the
commission
relies
upon
several
factors
and
put
some
into
conjunctive
and
one
falls
they
all
falls.
on
the
matter
of
injury
to
competition,
the
fifth
circuit
was
entirely
right
and
the
petitioners
pointed
out
no
reasons
why
in
this
anticompetitive
aspect
of
the
case,
the
fifth
circuit
should
be
reversed.
