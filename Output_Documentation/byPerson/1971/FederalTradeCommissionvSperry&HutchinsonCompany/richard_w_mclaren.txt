mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
is
before
the
court
on
writ
of
certiorari
for
the
fifth
circuit
which
overturned
the
federal
trade
commission
decision
that
respondent
sperry
and
hutchinson,
frequently
referred
to
as
s&h,
has
engaged
in
certain
unfair
activities
in
its
green
stamp
business
in
violation
of
section
5
of
the
federal
trade
commission
act.
the
complaint
in
this
case
was
in
three
counts.
count
one
was
in
the
nature
of
a
resale
price
maintenance
charge
that
s&h
issued
stamps
to
retailers
and
required
the
retailers
to
dispense
them
to
consumers
in
ratio
of
one
stamp
to
each
10
cents
worth
of
purchase.
second
count
charged
conspiracy
to
carry
out
this
program,
the
1:10
ratio
and
count
three
was
in
the
nature
of
an
unreasonable
restraint
on
the
alienation
charge
that
is
that
s&h
carried
out
a
policy
of
suppressing
trading
stamp
exchanges
and
preventing
anyone
other
than
s&h
from
redeeming
s&h
stamps.
and
this
count
also
contained
a
charge
of
conspiracy
by
s&h
with
other
stamp
firms
to
carry
out
this
program.
in
all
three
counts,
the
complaint
alleged
that
the
practices
were
anti-competitive
and
to
the
detriment
of
the
consuming
public.
commission
found
violation
under
all
three
counts
but
s&h
appealed
only
on
count
three
and
the
fifth
circuit
vacated
the
commission's
order
in
a
2:1
decision.
judge
wisdom
dissenting
that
majority
decision
is
now
here
for
review.
there
are
two
questions
presented.
the
first
principle
question
is
whether
the
fifth
circuit
was
in
error
in
holding
the
ftc’s
power
under
section
five
to
declare
particular
methods
of
competition
and
particular
acts
and
practices
unfair
is
limited
to
conduct
which
violates
the
letter
or
the
spirit
of
the
antitrust
laws.
a
subordinate
question
is
whether
the
commission
erred
as
the
circuit
court
seems
to
indicate
in
failing
to
give
sufficient
weight
to
decisions
under
state
law
that
operations
of
stamp
exchanges
and
the
retailers
who
redeemed
s&h
stamps
were
unlawful.
the
government’s
position
on
these
two
questions
since
the
first
one
is
that
ftc’s
power
is
not
limited
to
declaring
practices
unfair
simply
when
they
are
antitrust
type
of
conduct.
rather,
we
think
the
commission
has
a
broad
mandate
to
consider
the
circumstances
of
particular
cases
to
determine
what
is
unfair
in
the
light
of
the
public
interest
and
without
trying
to
define
the
outer
limits
of
this
power.
we
think
it
is
clear
first
that
a
practice
maybe
held
unfair
by
ftc
where
it
has
analyzed
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
particular
case
considered
reasons
for
the
practice,
the
need
forth
by
the
practitioner.
its
impact
on
the
various
factors
in
commerce
and
if
ftc
determines
on
this
basis,
that
the
practice
may
have
or
has
had
a
significant
adverse
effect
on
competition.
secondly,
we
think
that
the
practice
maybe
held
unfair
where
it
is
detrimental
to
the
interest
of
the
consuming
public
entirely
without
regard
to
the
question
of
effect
on
competition.
on
the
second
question,
the
state
law
question,
our
position
is
that
state
courts
decisions
on
matters
as
between
private
parties
are
to
be
given
little
rate
in
a
government
case
where
the
issue
involves
the
public
interest
and
particularly
where
broad
public
policy
considerations
such
as
those
found
in
section
5
case
are
present.
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
arrangements
for
example
in
the
brown
shoe
case
and
the
gasoline
company
tba
cases
were
entirely
legal
under
state
law
but
as
the
court
will
recall,
those
arrangements
had
to
give
way
to
the
overriding
policy
of
the
federal
trade
commission
act
and
its
intent
to
protect
a
competition.
turning
to
the
facts
of
the
particular
case,
they
are
relatively
simple
and
i
think
substantially
undisputed.
s&h
is
trading
operation
as
the
promotional
service
for
retailers.
under
the
system
s&h
licenses,
limited
number
of
retailers
to
handle
its
stamps
in
each
area.
the
retailers
receives
the
stamps
from
s&h
on
consignment
and
the
retailers
pay
a
service
charge
in
proportion
to
the
number
of
stamps
they
received.
this
runs
an
average
of
$2.68
a
book
of
12
hundred
stamps.
the
retailers
in
turn
dispense
the
stamps
to
consumers
in
proportion
to
their
purchases
and
this
has
been
as
i
indicate
earlier
on
a
one
for
ten
basis,
one
stamps
to
instant
purchase
and
this
book
says,
the
s&h
book
says
is
compensation
for
cash
payment.
in
other
words,
nature
of
the
cash
discount.
consumers
however
are
only
authorized
to
paste
the
stamps
in
books
and
to
redeem
the
books
with
s&h
for
merchandise,
nothing
else.
the
books
worth
about
three
dollars
on
redemption
and
merchandise
and
the
record
indicates
that
somewhere
between
5%
and
14%
of
stamps
go
unredeemed
as
the
records
shows
also
that
as
of
1964
there
were
several
hundred
million
worth
of
unredeemed
stamps
outstanding.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
that
went
back
to
the
beginning
of
s&h.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
a
long
period
of
time,
yes.
however,
s&h's
purchases
runs
some
320
million
a
year
and
it
growth
recedes.
so
this
is
more
than
a
good
bit
more
than
one
year.
turning
to
the
trading
stamps
industry,
we
find
that
is
a
rather
concentrated
one
with
six
companies
having
some
85%
of
the
business.
although,
there
are
some
total
of
400
companies.
s&h
is
a
good
bit
bank,
the
number
one
in
the
industry.
about
40%
of
total
industry
receipts
and
some
three
times
the
size
of
its
nearest
competitor.
some
77
thousand
retail
outlets
handle
s&h
stamps
and
nearly
60%
of
all
american
households
according
to
record
sale
s&h
stamps,
that
is
around
35
million
families.
to
give
an
idea
of
the
overall
economic
importance
of
stamps
in
1964,
the
stamps
of
all
kind
were
issued
on
40
billion
dollars
worth
purchases
and
on
some
43%
to
46%
of
all
food
store
purchase.
in
some
areas,
it
went
as
high
as
95%
and
the
record
shows
that
rx
24
that
where
stamps
are
prevalent.
they
tend
to
increase
the
level
of
retail
prices
and
making
the
calculation
of
one
stamp
for
a
10
cent
purchase,
this
would
come
to
about
2%
on
sales.
coming
to
the
main
issue
of
trading
stamps
exchanges
and
the
redeeming
retailers,
the
record
indicates
that
exchange
is
developed
to
meet
the
desire
of
consumers
to
get
more
out
of
the
various
stamps
that
they
were
receiving
as
a
shop.
a
good
many
housewives
testified
and
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
from
their
testimony
that
they
principally
wanted
to
consolidate
different
stamps
into
one
kind
of
a
stamp.
this
permitted
them
to
go
out
and
redeem.
they
would
not
have
to
wait
so
long
to
fill
up
a
single
kind
of
stamp
book.
they
could
get
their
christmas
presents
or
whatever
it
might
be
to
fill
an
immediate
need
or
in
some
cases
they
wanted
to
cash
them
in.
perhaps
they
are
leaving
the
part
of
the
country
where
the
stamps
reused
or
they
came
to
a
part
of
the
company
where
they
were
not
in
circulation,
perhaps
their
military
personnel
going
abroad,
sometimes
they
wanted
to
get
a
better
buy
as
they
could
get
a
better
selection
from
one
company
stamp
catalogs
and
from
another
or
maybe
the
redemption
center
was
more
convenient.
within
25
miles
you
cannot
mail
in,
you
must
come-in
in
person.
if
you
do
not
have
a
card
perhaps
there
is
another
company
with
a
more
center.
in
any
event
the
exchanges
grew
up,
the
cumulative
stocks
of
the
different
kinds
of
stamps
as
many
as
50.
different
kinds
would
be
stocked.
they
would
principally
exchange
and
i
think
that
was
some
60%
of
their
business.
they
would
also
sell
stamps
to
help
somebody
get
the
7th
book,
if
we
had
six
together,
we
would
get
a
particular
item
something
in
that
order
and
they
would
buy
stamps
from
people
who
wanted
to
sell
as
i
indicated.
they
charged
a
fee
of
around
30
to
50
cents
per
book
for
exchanging
and
they
also
had
varying
prices
perhaps
they
buy
for
a
dollar-and-a-half
a
book
and
sell
for
two
quarter
at
275
per
book.
the
record
also
shows
that
small
retailers
got
into
the
redemption
business
as
a
way
of
competing
for
business.
they
would
give
credit
for
stamps
on
purchases,
perhaps
small
items
would
not
be
carried
in
the
catalogues,
work
clothing,
baby
clothing,
shoes,
the
hose,
and
things
like
that
or
in
another
cases
retailers
would
accept
the
stamps
as
down
payments
on
bigger
items
comparable
to
those
in
the
catalogues
and
this
was
the
way
that
some
of
the
appliance
stores
and
small
department
stores
had
competing
in
effect
with
the
redemption
centers
of
s&h.
they
take
the
stamps
as
down
payment.
now,
the
pleadings
and
the
evidence
show
that
s&h
had
a
very
strong
program
with
regard
to
these
exchangers
and
retailers
handling
the
stamps.
they
tried
in
every
way,
i
think
one
of
the
executives
testified
to
prevent
that.
they
wrote
hundreds
of
letters,
they
took
court
action
to
close
down
this
kind
of
an
operations
and
the
record
shows
that
they
were
quite
successful
in
doing
so.
the
businesses
of
some
of
the
exchange
or
exchanges
enjoined
from
handling
as
to
make
stamps
dropped
of
40%
to
60%.
some
closed
down
completely
and
many
redeeming
retailers
stopped
handling
stamps.
some
consumers
testified
that
they
would
give
or
throw
stamps
away
in
the
absence
of
exchanges
because
if
you
had
to
take
through
the
whole
length
of
time
on
a
single
brand,
it
just
took
too
long
to
work
that.
now
s&h
is
just
occasion
for
its
program
was
given
through
the
testimony
of
a
doctor.
one
director
that
the
free
exchange
and
redemption
by
others
would
break
the
relationship
between
s&h
and
retailers
and
the
consumer,
would
reduce
the
incentive
of
shoppers
to
patronize
the
s&h
retailers
to
fill
their
books
and
it
would
reduce
or
eliminate
this
to
redemption
centers
and
over
all
would
reduce
the
tie
of
the
consumer
to
s&h.
this
would
in
turn
cause
the
retailer
to
lose
interest
in
s&h
and
they
anticipated
that
they
would
lose
their
licensees.
s&h
did
not
offer
any
evidence
that
this
in
fact
happened
in
any
of
these
areas
where
the
exchanges
or
the
redeeming
retailers
operated
in
a
number
of
them
who
testified
were
still
on
operation.
they
had
not
been
enjoined.
s&h
showed
no
loss
of
licensees
nor
even
complaints
by
licensees.
no
retailer
took
the
stand
to
indicate
that
he
had
any
loss
of
consumer
business
in
the
areas
where
the
exchanges
or
other
retailers
were
redeeming.
many
housewives
testified
although
they
used
the
exchanges.
this
did
not
lessen
their
buying
at
s&h
stores
to
change
their
shopping
habits
in
any
way
and
other
evidence
shows
also
that
stamps
are
insignificant
factor
with
housewives
in
deciding
where
to
shop.
in
other
words
they
decided
where
to
shop
based
on
price
and
specials
on
convenient
and
quality
of
the
need
or
produced
from
this
for
particular
basic
goods.
many
things
other
than
stamps
although
a
survey
did
show
that
some
16%
of
people
will
go
out
of
the
way
to
get
particular
stamps
but
only
16%.
now
ftc’s
decision
on
these
facts
is
based
on
what
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
as
the
rule
of
reason
approach.
they
considered
this,
it
is
a
very
lengthy
record.
many
thousand
of
pages,
they
considered
the
justification
of
his
claims.
they
considered
the
need
for
this
restrictions.
mandate
considered
particularly
the
impact
of
the
restriction.
they
found
no
good
business
reason
for
it.
they
found
no
necessity
for
the
restriction
and
they
held
that
the
fears
of
s&h
as
officers,
that
they
would
lose
licensees
and
so
on
were
entitled
the
very
little
weight
because
they
are
in
general
terms.
they
weren't
backed
up
by
hard
tracks
and
because
they
were
contrary
to
the
other
evidence
that
s&h
in
fact
had
not
been
heard
and
they
saw
no
signs.
it
would
be
heard
by
the
extremes
and
to
out
or
by
retailers,
the
redemptions
in
the
future.
i
think
there
is
good
precedent
for
rejecting
that
kind
of
testimony
in
here.
i
would
to
the
court's
holding
sold
off
a
bank’s,
where
the
opinions
of
bank
officers
as
to
adverse
effect
on
competition
from
the
merger
so
that
competition
would
be
entered
and
so
on,
was
not
given
very
weight.
ftc’s
ultimate
finding
here
was
that
the
effect
of
s&h
practices
in
quoting
was
to
fair,
unfairly
suppress
such
exchanges
and
the
business
of
such
retailers
to
the
detriment
of
the
persons
engaged
therein
and
the
consuming
public
and
be
to
substantially
impair
and
restraining
competition.
the
commission
concluded
that
the
act
in
practices
were
”to
the
prejudice
and
injury
of
the
public
that
they
unreasonably
restrained,
injured
and
impaired
competition
and
thereby
were
unfair
under
section
5.”
i
think
it
is
important
to
note
that
both
the
complaint
and
complaint
counsel's
theory
of
the
case
throughout
emphasize
this
restrictive
policy
on
exchange
and
redemption
had
an
unreasonable
impact
on
the
consuming
public
as
well
as
an
adverse
effect
on
competition.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
am
sorry;
i
did
not
make
that
clear
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
commission
found
against
s&h
on
that
proposition.
both
as
a
unilateral
enforcement
and
as
the
conspiracy
and
there
was
no
appeal
on
that.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
it
was
only
count
three
that
came
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
it
is
only
count
three
that
is
here.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
mr.
elman’s
opinion
as
i
recall.
he
concurred
in
the
result
here
but
he
had
dissented
from
the
issuance
of
the
complaint
originally
on
the
theory
that
there
are
to
be
incomplete
in
--.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
industry
wide
study,
yes.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
and
i
think
he
simply
concurred
and
reiterated
that
then
commissioner
jones
i
believe
dissented
only
on
the
theory
that
the
remedy
did
not
go
far
enough
with
respect
to
the
one
for
ten
holdings.
in
other
words
there
was
a
limit
on
maximum
designation
of
the
trading
ratio
but
not
on
the
minimum.
she
thought
there
ought
to
be
both
and
i
think
she
went
by
all
the
old
record.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
well,
as
the
matter
of
law.
we
think
that
the
commission
in
this
case
could
have
based
its
decision
on
either
of
these
two
grounds.
the
adverse
effect
on
competition
or
the
detrimental
effect
upon
the
consuming
public.
as
to
the
first
ground,
i
think
at
least
since
brown
shoe
where
the
gratz
rule
was
official
entered,
this
court
has
recognized
that
although
ultimate
responsibility
risks
with
the
courts,
congress
has
reposed
on
ftc
very
broad
powers
to
give
content
to
the
term
'unfair'
and
to
determine
at
exactly
what
point
when
a
practice
is
otherwise
lawful.
at
what
point
in
its
effect
upon
competition,
the
practice
becomes
unfair.
as
the
court
said
on
the
text
called
tba
case,
“it
is
enough
that
the
practice
in
question
unfairly
burden
competition
were
not
insignificant
volume
of
commerce”.
and
here
i
think
that
standard
was
not
only
met
but
substantially
exceeded
since
the
commission
found
that
with
respect
to
exchanges,
s&h
had
an
exercise.
monopoly
power
over
the
trading
stamps
exchanges
and
they
intended
to
eliminate
a
whole
class
of
small
businessman.
as
far
as
the
retailers
are
concerned,
they
found
that
there
is
a
restorative
trade
on
these
retailers
and
found
stamps
and
other
way
of
competing
and
serving
their
customers
and
those
two
points.
i
think
fully
support
the
commission
on
the
anti
competitive
ground.
as
far
as
the
unfairness
for
being
detrimental
to
the
interest
of
the
public,
i
think
that
is
fully
supported
as
judge
wisdom
pointed
out
in
its
dissent,
it
was
a
very
purpose
of
the
wheeler-lea
amendment
in
1938
to
establish
this
proposition.
the
legislative
history
which
judge
wisdom
outlined,
various
lower
federal
court
decisions
which
we
have
listed
in
our
briefs
and
the
commission
itself
and
of
course
under
the
rules
of
this
court
and
the
commissions
interpretation
of
its
own
statute
is
entitled
to
a
great
deal
of
way.
the
commission
has
interpreted
a
statute
in
that
way.
all
in
support
of
this
particular
proposition
that
whether
it
is
adverse
affect
on
the
consuming
public,
there
needn't
be
in
effect,
adverse
effect
on
competition.
in
fact,
ftc
in
a
very
analytical
opinion
going
into
the
matter
very
carefully
based
its
holding
on
both
of
these
propositions
and
under
the
test
applicable
on
these
appeals,
we
think
it
is
warranted
in
the
record
and
there
is
reason
in
the
law
to
support
it
and
we
would
urge
for
these
reasons
that
the
court
reverse
the
decisions
of
fifth
circuit
and
remand
for
a
judgment.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
it
is
at
paragraph
5,
mr.
justice
brennan
and
in
paragraph
6
and
paragraph
7.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
yes,
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
assume
that
they
are
in
process.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
not
on
appeal.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
mr.
justice
white,
the
opinion
itself
speaks
very
little
in
the
section
under
count
three
of
the
impact
on
consumers.
i
think
that
it
is
in
the
ultimate
findings
which
i
read,
which
were
i
think
on
page
125
there,
and
there
are
one
or
two
other
references
in
the
commissions
opinion.
mostly,
the
commission
addressed
itself
to
the
question
of
the
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
anticompetitive
effect
and-
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
as
the
matter
of
law,
i
think
in
your
question
of
course
mr.
justice
white
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
no,
i
think
that
in
this
particular
case,
the
commission
saw
this
as
a
matter
of
impact
upon
the
consumer
from
the
elimination
of
these
outlets
and
this
runs
throughout
the
opinion
and
the
both
commission.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
yes.
i
think
so
and
i
would
point
the
report
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
look
at
order.
at
the
order
they
say
that
s&h
can
no
longer
purport
to
reserve
title
and
to
restrain
alienation
of
it.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
and
it
is
not
the
opinion
but
the
order
goes
to
that
and
that
have
(inaudible)
to
me.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
think
that
it
is
true
that
the
impact
on
competition
caused
the
injuries
to
the
consumer
and
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
that
undoubtedly
is
true.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
no.
i
do
not
think
we
quite
say
that
mr.
justice
white.
we
say
that
the
fifth
circuit
is
wrong
in
saying
that
you
must
have
a
violation
of
sphere
or
the
letter
of
antitrust
law
and
we
say
they
are
wrong
in
two
ways.
you
can
have
anticompetitive
impact
that
is
not
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
law
as
it
violates
section
5.
you
can
also
have
an
impact
by
consumers
without
regard
to
competition
and
you
can
hold
the
section
5
violation
on
that
ground.
that
is
a
far
reaching
opinion,
mr.
justice
white,
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
we
feel
badly
needs
rejection
in
order
for
the
ftc
to
continue
by
its
business.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
as
a
matter
of
law,
yes
they
could.
on
this
record
i
think
the
commission
rested
on
both.
i
would
like
to
call
your
attention
to
the
phrase
in
the
middle
of
page
177
where
the
commission
said
that
the
trading
exchanges
had
provided
a
useful
and
valuable
function,
but
i
agree
with
you.
we
do
have
two
propositions
here.
one,
the
question
of
law
where
we
are
speaking
to
what
the
fifth
circuit
said,
the
other
a
question
of
this
record
and
here
i
think
the
commission
rested
on
both,
both
the
impact
on
the
consumer
and
on
the
competition.
i
would
like
to
reserve
rest
of
time
i
have.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
with
regard
to
the
question
of
the
prices,
rx
24,
an
exhibit
of
the
respondent
states
“stamp
cost
clearly
range
margins
when
all
or
most
retailers
in
an
area
employ
them”.
rx
24k
that
is.
we
think
may
it
please
the
court
that
this
is
a
good
debt
more
in
a
question
of
convenience
of
consumers
as
i
indicated
earlier,
some
43%
to
46%
of
all
food
purchases
carry
with
them
food
stamps
and
there
is
testimony
in
the
record
and
i
think
it
is
well
justified.
housewives
feel
that
they
pay
for
these
stamps
and
the
witnesses
who
testified
felt
that
they
should
have
a
right
to
deal
with
them
substantially
as
they
wished
and
not
to
be
restricted
in
something
that
they
had
paid
for.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
no
specific
mr.
chief
justice
i
was
quoting
from
the
testimony
of
one
of
the
witnesses.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
think
it
would.
chief
justice,
on
the
other
hand,
i
think
where
we
follow
the
standard
on
judicial
review,
if
we
look
for
warrant
in
the
record
and
reason
in
law
and
i
think
there
is
warrant
in
the
record.
this
count
three
came
at
the
end
of
the
very
long
opinion
that
dealt
in
many
respects
with
this
whole
stamp
business
and
restrictive
practices
that
s&h
used
and
the
fact
i
think
that
count
three
does
not
fully
contain
every
little
finding
should
not
be
read
in
isolation
but
rather
the
opinion
should
be
looked
at
as
a
whole
and
as
well
as
the
fact
that
there
is
record
support
for
these
propositions
that
i
think
are
inherent
in
the
lengthy
findings
and
the
opinion
of
the
prosecution.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
well,
the
heart
of
the
case
is
double
findings
that
there
is
an
adverse
effect
on
competition,
that
there
is
an
adverse
effect
on
the
consuming
public.
i
think
that
that
if
the
commission
had
taken
the
approach
solely
of
going
by
the
proposition
of
the
legal
consequence
of
s&h
having
eliminated
these
outlets
and
focussed
entirely
on
the
fact
that
now
all
these
outlets
are
out
of
the
way,
they
have
this
restriction
in
the
book
that
says
you
do
not
own
the
stamp
and
so
on
and
so
on.
we
find
that
just
an
ultimate
finding,
this
has
prevented
consumers
from
dealing
freely
with
stamps.
this
is
an
unfair
method
of
competition
or
an
unfair
trade
practice.
i
think
that
would
have
been
enough
but
they
did
both.
on
the
way
to
that
finding,
on
the
way
to
the
consumer
finding
they
said
this
has
an
adverse
effect
on
competition
that
in
effect
will
support
an
unfair
holding.
they
are
supported
both
ways
and
i
do
not
think
that
say
should
be
folded
simply
because
they
did
not
spell
out
the
fact
that
here
and
they
are
along
the
way.
this
effect
and
not
effect
on
the
consumer,
the
effect
on
the
consumer
was
tied
in
with
the
effect
on
the
competition.
the
two
things,
the
restrictive
provision
in
the
stamp
and
the
elimination
of
the
places
where
you
could
trade
the
stamps.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
think
it
need
not
be
ignored
mr.
justice
stewart
and
i
think
that
there
is
a
solid
finding
and
it
is
a
finding
at
page
126
that
way.
it
is
not
a
conclusion.
it
is
a
finding
and
then
they
went
on
and
they
concluded
that
the
effect
of
all
of
this
was
anti-competitive
in
contrary
to
this.
thank
you.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
is
before
the
court
on
writ
of
certiorari
for
the
fifth
circuit
which
overturned
the
federal
trade
commission
decision
that
respondent
sperry
and
hutchinson,
frequently
referred
to
as
s&h,
has
engaged
in
certain
unfair
activities
in
its
green
stamp
business
in
violation
of
section
5
of
the
federal
trade
commission
act.
the
complaint
in
this
case
was
in
three
counts.
count
one
was
in
the
nature
of
a
resale
price
maintenance
charge
that
s&h
issued
stamps
to
retailers
and
required
the
retailers
to
dispense
them
to
consumers
in
ratio
of
one
stamp
to
each
10
cents
worth
of
purchase.
second
count
charged
conspiracy
to
carry
out
this
program,
the
1:10
ratio
and
count
three
was
in
the
nature
of
an
unreasonable
restraint
on
the
alienation
charge
that
is
that
s&h
carried
out
a
policy
of
suppressing
trading
stamp
exchanges
and
preventing
anyone
other
than
s&h
from
redeeming
s&h
stamps.
and
this
count
also
contained
a
charge
of
conspiracy
by
s&h
with
other
stamp
firms
to
carry
out
this
program.
in
all
three
counts,
the
complaint
alleged
that
the
practices
were
anti-competitive
and
to
the
detriment
of
the
consuming
public.
commission
found
violation
under
all
three
counts
but
s&h
appealed
only
on
count
three
and
the
fifth
circuit
vacated
the
commission's
order
in
a
2:1
decision.
judge
wisdom
dissenting
that
majority
decision
is
now
here
for
review.
there
are
two
questions
presented.
the
first
principle
question
is
whether
the
fifth
circuit
was
in
error
in
holding
the
ftc’s
power
under
section
five
to
declare
particular
methods
of
competition
and
particular
acts
and
practices
unfair
is
limited
to
conduct
which
violates
the
letter
or
the
spirit
of
the
antitrust
laws.
a
subordinate
question
is
whether
the
commission
erred
as
the
circuit
court
seems
to
indicate
in
failing
to
give
sufficient
weight
to
decisions
under
state
law
that
operations
of
stamp
exchanges
and
the
retailers
who
redeemed
s&h
stamps
were
unlawful.
the
government’s
position
on
these
two
questions
since
the
first
one
is
that
ftc’s
power
is
not
limited
to
declaring
practices
unfair
simply
when
they
are
antitrust
type
of
conduct.
rather,
we
think
the
commission
has
a
broad
mandate
to
consider
the
circumstances
of
particular
cases
to
determine
what
is
unfair
in
the
light
of
the
public
interest
and
without
trying
to
define
the
outer
limits
of
this
power.
we
think
it
is
clear
first
that
a
practice
maybe
held
unfair
by
ftc
where
it
has
analyzed
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
particular
case
considered
reasons
for
the
practice,
the
need
forth
by
the
practitioner.
its
impact
on
the
various
factors
in
commerce
and
if
ftc
determines
on
this
basis,
that
the
practice
may
have
or
has
had
a
significant
adverse
effect
on
competition.
secondly,
we
think
that
the
practice
maybe
held
unfair
where
it
is
detrimental
to
the
interest
of
the
consuming
public
entirely
without
regard
to
the
question
of
effect
on
competition.
on
the
second
question,
the
state
law
question,
our
position
is
that
state
courts
decisions
on
matters
as
between
private
parties
are
to
be
given
little
rate
in
a
government
case
where
the
issue
involves
the
public
interest
and
particularly
where
broad
public
policy
considerations
such
as
those
found
in
section
5
case
are
present.
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
arrangements
for
example
in
the
brown
shoe
case
and
the
gasoline
company
tba
cases
were
entirely
legal
under
state
law
but
as
the
court
will
recall,
those
arrangements
had
to
give
way
to
the
overriding
policy
of
the
federal
trade
commission
act
and
its
intent
to
protect
a
competition.
turning
to
the
facts
of
the
particular
case,
they
are
relatively
simple
and
i
think
substantially
undisputed.
s&h
is
trading
operation
as
the
promotional
service
for
retailers.
under
the
system
s&h
licenses,
limited
number
of
retailers
to
handle
its
stamps
in
each
area.
the
retailers
receives
the
stamps
from
s&h
on
consignment
and
the
retailers
pay
a
service
charge
in
proportion
to
the
number
of
stamps
they
received.
this
runs
an
average
of
$2.68
a
book
of
12
hundred
stamps.
the
retailers
in
turn
dispense
the
stamps
to
consumers
in
proportion
to
their
purchases
and
this
has
been
as
i
indicate
earlier
on
a
one
for
ten
basis,
one
stamps
to
instant
purchase
and
this
book
says,
the
s&h
book
says
is
compensation
for
cash
payment.
in
other
words,
nature
of
the
cash
discount.
consumers
however
are
only
authorized
to
paste
the
stamps
in
books
and
to
redeem
the
books
with
s&h
for
merchandise,
nothing
else.
the
books
worth
about
three
dollars
on
redemption
and
merchandise
and
the
record
indicates
that
somewhere
between
5%
and
14%
of
stamps
go
unredeemed
as
the
records
shows
also
that
as
of
1964
there
were
several
hundred
million
worth
of
unredeemed
stamps
outstanding.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
that
went
back
to
the
beginning
of
s&h.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
a
long
period
of
time,
yes.
however,
s&h's
purchases
runs
some
320
million
a
year
and
it
growth
recedes.
so
this
is
more
than
a
good
bit
more
than
one
year.
turning
to
the
trading
stamps
industry,
we
find
that
is
a
rather
concentrated
one
with
six
companies
having
some
85%
of
the
business.
although,
there
are
some
total
of
400
companies.
s&h
is
a
good
bit
bank,
the
number
one
in
the
industry.
about
40%
of
total
industry
receipts
and
some
three
times
the
size
of
its
nearest
competitor.
some
77
thousand
retail
outlets
handle
s&h
stamps
and
nearly
60%
of
all
american
households
according
to
record
sale
s&h
stamps,
that
is
around
35
million
families.
to
give
an
idea
of
the
overall
economic
importance
of
stamps
in
1964,
the
stamps
of
all
kind
were
issued
on
40
billion
dollars
worth
purchases
and
on
some
43%
to
46%
of
all
food
store
purchase.
in
some
areas,
it
went
as
high
as
95%
and
the
record
shows
that
rx
24
that
where
stamps
are
prevalent.
they
tend
to
increase
the
level
of
retail
prices
and
making
the
calculation
of
one
stamp
for
a
10
cent
purchase,
this
would
come
to
about
2%
on
sales.
coming
to
the
main
issue
of
trading
stamps
exchanges
and
the
redeeming
retailers,
the
record
indicates
that
exchange
is
developed
to
meet
the
desire
of
consumers
to
get
more
out
of
the
various
stamps
that
they
were
receiving
as
a
shop.
a
good
many
housewives
testified
and
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
from
their
testimony
that
they
principally
wanted
to
consolidate
different
stamps
into
one
kind
of
a
stamp.
this
permitted
them
to
go
out
and
redeem.
they
would
not
have
to
wait
so
long
to
fill
up
a
single
kind
of
stamp
book.
they
could
get
their
christmas
presents
or
whatever
it
might
be
to
fill
an
immediate
need
or
in
some
cases
they
wanted
to
cash
them
in.
perhaps
they
are
leaving
the
part
of
the
country
where
the
stamps
reused
or
they
came
to
a
part
of
the
company
where
they
were
not
in
circulation,
perhaps
their
military
personnel
going
abroad,
sometimes
they
wanted
to
get
a
better
buy
as
they
could
get
a
better
selection
from
one
company
stamp
catalogs
and
from
another
or
maybe
the
redemption
center
was
more
convenient.
within
25
miles
you
cannot
mail
in,
you
must
come-in
in
person.
if
you
do
not
have
a
card
perhaps
there
is
another
company
with
a
more
center.
in
any
event
the
exchanges
grew
up,
the
cumulative
stocks
of
the
different
kinds
of
stamps
as
many
as
50.
different
kinds
would
be
stocked.
they
would
principally
exchange
and
i
think
that
was
some
60%
of
their
business.
they
would
also
sell
stamps
to
help
somebody
get
the
7th
book,
if
we
had
six
together,
we
would
get
a
particular
item
something
in
that
order
and
they
would
buy
stamps
from
people
who
wanted
to
sell
as
i
indicated.
they
charged
a
fee
of
around
30
to
50
cents
per
book
for
exchanging
and
they
also
had
varying
prices
perhaps
they
buy
for
a
dollar-and-a-half
a
book
and
sell
for
two
quarter
at
275
per
book.
the
record
also
shows
that
small
retailers
got
into
the
redemption
business
as
a
way
of
competing
for
business.
they
would
give
credit
for
stamps
on
purchases,
perhaps
small
items
would
not
be
carried
in
the
catalogues,
work
clothing,
baby
clothing,
shoes,
the
hose,
and
things
like
that
or
in
another
cases
retailers
would
accept
the
stamps
as
down
payments
on
bigger
items
comparable
to
those
in
the
catalogues
and
this
was
the
way
that
some
of
the
appliance
stores
and
small
department
stores
had
competing
in
effect
with
the
redemption
centers
of
s&h.
they
take
the
stamps
as
down
payment.
now,
the
pleadings
and
the
evidence
show
that
s&h
had
a
very
strong
program
with
regard
to
these
exchangers
and
retailers
handling
the
stamps.
they
tried
in
every
way,
i
think
one
of
the
executives
testified
to
prevent
that.
they
wrote
hundreds
of
letters,
they
took
court
action
to
close
down
this
kind
of
an
operations
and
the
record
shows
that
they
were
quite
successful
in
doing
so.
the
businesses
of
some
of
the
exchange
or
exchanges
enjoined
from
handling
as
to
make
stamps
dropped
of
40%
to
60%.
some
closed
down
completely
and
many
redeeming
retailers
stopped
handling
stamps.
some
consumers
testified
that
they
would
give
or
throw
stamps
away
in
the
absence
of
exchanges
because
if
you
had
to
take
through
the
whole
length
of
time
on
a
single
brand,
it
just
took
too
long
to
work
that.
now
s&h
is
just
occasion
for
its
program
was
given
through
the
testimony
of
a
doctor.
one
director
that
the
free
exchange
and
redemption
by
others
would
break
the
relationship
between
s&h
and
retailers
and
the
consumer,
would
reduce
the
incentive
of
shoppers
to
patronize
the
s&h
retailers
to
fill
their
books
and
it
would
reduce
or
eliminate
this
to
redemption
centers
and
over
all
would
reduce
the
tie
of
the
consumer
to
s&h.
this
would
in
turn
cause
the
retailer
to
lose
interest
in
s&h
and
they
anticipated
that
they
would
lose
their
licensees.
s&h
did
not
offer
any
evidence
that
this
in
fact
happened
in
any
of
these
areas
where
the
exchanges
or
the
redeeming
retailers
operated
in
a
number
of
them
who
testified
were
still
on
operation.
they
had
not
been
enjoined.
s&h
showed
no
loss
of
licensees
nor
even
complaints
by
licensees.
no
retailer
took
the
stand
to
indicate
that
he
had
any
loss
of
consumer
business
in
the
areas
where
the
exchanges
or
other
retailers
were
redeeming.
many
housewives
testified
although
they
used
the
exchanges.
this
did
not
lessen
their
buying
at
s&h
stores
to
change
their
shopping
habits
in
any
way
and
other
evidence
shows
also
that
stamps
are
insignificant
factor
with
housewives
in
deciding
where
to
shop.
in
other
words
they
decided
where
to
shop
based
on
price
and
specials
on
convenient
and
quality
of
the
need
or
produced
from
this
for
particular
basic
goods.
many
things
other
than
stamps
although
a
survey
did
show
that
some
16%
of
people
will
go
out
of
the
way
to
get
particular
stamps
but
only
16%.
now
ftc’s
decision
on
these
facts
is
based
on
what
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
as
the
rule
of
reason
approach.
they
considered
this,
it
is
a
very
lengthy
record.
many
thousand
of
pages,
they
considered
the
justification
of
his
claims.
they
considered
the
need
for
this
restrictions.
mandate
considered
particularly
the
impact
of
the
restriction.
they
found
no
good
business
reason
for
it.
they
found
no
necessity
for
the
restriction
and
they
held
that
the
fears
of
s&h
as
officers,
that
they
would
lose
licensees
and
so
on
were
entitled
the
very
little
weight
because
they
are
in
general
terms.
they
weren't
backed
up
by
hard
tracks
and
because
they
were
contrary
to
the
other
evidence
that
s&h
in
fact
had
not
been
heard
and
they
saw
no
signs.
it
would
be
heard
by
the
extremes
and
to
out
or
by
retailers,
the
redemptions
in
the
future.
i
think
there
is
good
precedent
for
rejecting
that
kind
of
testimony
in
here.
i
would
to
the
court's
holding
sold
off
a
bank’s,
where
the
opinions
of
bank
officers
as
to
adverse
effect
on
competition
from
the
merger
so
that
competition
would
be
entered
and
so
on,
was
not
given
very
weight.
ftc’s
ultimate
finding
here
was
that
the
effect
of
s&h
practices
in
quoting
was
to
fair,
unfairly
suppress
such
exchanges
and
the
business
of
such
retailers
to
the
detriment
of
the
persons
engaged
therein
and
the
consuming
public
and
be
to
substantially
impair
and
restraining
competition.
the
commission
concluded
that
the
act
in
practices
were
”to
the
prejudice
and
injury
of
the
public
that
they
unreasonably
restrained,
injured
and
impaired
competition
and
thereby
were
unfair
under
section
5.”
i
think
it
is
important
to
note
that
both
the
complaint
and
complaint
counsel's
theory
of
the
case
throughout
emphasize
this
restrictive
policy
on
exchange
and
redemption
had
an
unreasonable
impact
on
the
consuming
public
as
well
as
an
adverse
effect
on
competition.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
am
sorry;
i
did
not
make
that
clear
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
commission
found
against
s&h
on
that
proposition.
both
as
a
unilateral
enforcement
and
as
the
conspiracy
and
there
was
no
appeal
on
that.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
it
was
only
count
three
that
came
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
it
is
only
count
three
that
is
here.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
mr.
elman’s
opinion
as
i
recall.
he
concurred
in
the
result
here
but
he
had
dissented
from
the
issuance
of
the
complaint
originally
on
the
theory
that
there
are
to
be
incomplete
in
--.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
industry
wide
study,
yes.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
and
i
think
he
simply
concurred
and
reiterated
that
then
commissioner
jones
i
believe
dissented
only
on
the
theory
that
the
remedy
did
not
go
far
enough
with
respect
to
the
one
for
ten
holdings.
in
other
words
there
was
a
limit
on
maximum
designation
of
the
trading
ratio
but
not
on
the
minimum.
she
thought
there
ought
to
be
both
and
i
think
she
went
by
all
the
old
record.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
well,
as
the
matter
of
law.
we
think
that
the
commission
in
this
case
could
have
based
its
decision
on
either
of
these
two
grounds.
the
adverse
effect
on
competition
or
the
detrimental
effect
upon
the
consuming
public.
as
to
the
first
ground,
i
think
at
least
since
brown
shoe
where
the
gratz
rule
was
official
entered,
this
court
has
recognized
that
although
ultimate
responsibility
risks
with
the
courts,
congress
has
reposed
on
ftc
very
broad
powers
to
give
content
to
the
term
'unfair'
and
to
determine
at
exactly
what
point
when
a
practice
is
otherwise
lawful.
at
what
point
in
its
effect
upon
competition,
the
practice
becomes
unfair.
as
the
court
said
on
the
text
called
tba
case,
“it
is
enough
that
the
practice
in
question
unfairly
burden
competition
were
not
insignificant
volume
of
commerce”.
and
here
i
think
that
standard
was
not
only
met
but
substantially
exceeded
since
the
commission
found
that
with
respect
to
exchanges,
s&h
had
an
exercise.
monopoly
power
over
the
trading
stamps
exchanges
and
they
intended
to
eliminate
a
whole
class
of
small
businessman.
as
far
as
the
retailers
are
concerned,
they
found
that
there
is
a
restorative
trade
on
these
retailers
and
found
stamps
and
other
way
of
competing
and
serving
their
customers
and
those
two
points.
i
think
fully
support
the
commission
on
the
anti
competitive
ground.
as
far
as
the
unfairness
for
being
detrimental
to
the
interest
of
the
public,
i
think
that
is
fully
supported
as
judge
wisdom
pointed
out
in
its
dissent,
it
was
a
very
purpose
of
the
wheeler-lea
amendment
in
1938
to
establish
this
proposition.
the
legislative
history
which
judge
wisdom
outlined,
various
lower
federal
court
decisions
which
we
have
listed
in
our
briefs
and
the
commission
itself
and
of
course
under
the
rules
of
this
court
and
the
commissions
interpretation
of
its
own
statute
is
entitled
to
a
great
deal
of
way.
the
commission
has
interpreted
a
statute
in
that
way.
all
in
support
of
this
particular
proposition
that
whether
it
is
adverse
affect
on
the
consuming
public,
there
needn't
be
in
effect,
adverse
effect
on
competition.
in
fact,
ftc
in
a
very
analytical
opinion
going
into
the
matter
very
carefully
based
its
holding
on
both
of
these
propositions
and
under
the
test
applicable
on
these
appeals,
we
think
it
is
warranted
in
the
record
and
there
is
reason
in
the
law
to
support
it
and
we
would
urge
for
these
reasons
that
the
court
reverse
the
decisions
of
fifth
circuit
and
remand
for
a
judgment.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
it
is
at
paragraph
5,
mr.
justice
brennan
and
in
paragraph
6
and
paragraph
7.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
yes,
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
assume
that
they
are
in
process.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
not
on
appeal.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
mr.
justice
white,
the
opinion
itself
speaks
very
little
in
the
section
under
count
three
of
the
impact
on
consumers.
i
think
that
it
is
in
the
ultimate
findings
which
i
read,
which
were
i
think
on
page
125
there,
and
there
are
one
or
two
other
references
in
the
commissions
opinion.
mostly,
the
commission
addressed
itself
to
the
question
of
the
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
anticompetitive
effect
and-
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
as
the
matter
of
law,
i
think
in
your
question
of
course
mr.
justice
white
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
no,
i
think
that
in
this
particular
case,
the
commission
saw
this
as
a
matter
of
impact
upon
the
consumer
from
the
elimination
of
these
outlets
and
this
runs
throughout
the
opinion
and
the
both
commission.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
yes.
i
think
so
and
i
would
point
the
report
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
look
at
order.
at
the
order
they
say
that
s&h
can
no
longer
purport
to
reserve
title
and
to
restrain
alienation
of
it.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
and
it
is
not
the
opinion
but
the
order
goes
to
that
and
that
have
(inaudible)
to
me.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
think
that
it
is
true
that
the
impact
on
competition
caused
the
injuries
to
the
consumer
and
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
that
undoubtedly
is
true.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
no.
i
do
not
think
we
quite
say
that
mr.
justice
white.
we
say
that
the
fifth
circuit
is
wrong
in
saying
that
you
must
have
a
violation
of
sphere
or
the
letter
of
antitrust
law
and
we
say
they
are
wrong
in
two
ways.
you
can
have
anticompetitive
impact
that
is
not
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
law
as
it
violates
section
5.
you
can
also
have
an
impact
by
consumers
without
regard
to
competition
and
you
can
hold
the
section
5
violation
on
that
ground.
that
is
a
far
reaching
opinion,
mr.
justice
white,
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
we
feel
badly
needs
rejection
in
order
for
the
ftc
to
continue
by
its
business.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
as
a
matter
of
law,
yes
they
could.
on
this
record
i
think
the
commission
rested
on
both.
i
would
like
to
call
your
attention
to
the
phrase
in
the
middle
of
page
177
where
the
commission
said
that
the
trading
exchanges
had
provided
a
useful
and
valuable
function,
but
i
agree
with
you.
we
do
have
two
propositions
here.
one,
the
question
of
law
where
we
are
speaking
to
what
the
fifth
circuit
said,
the
other
a
question
of
this
record
and
here
i
think
the
commission
rested
on
both,
both
the
impact
on
the
consumer
and
on
the
competition.
i
would
like
to
reserve
rest
of
time
i
have.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
with
regard
to
the
question
of
the
prices,
rx
24,
an
exhibit
of
the
respondent
states
“stamp
cost
clearly
range
margins
when
all
or
most
retailers
in
an
area
employ
them”.
rx
24k
that
is.
we
think
may
it
please
the
court
that
this
is
a
good
debt
more
in
a
question
of
convenience
of
consumers
as
i
indicated
earlier,
some
43%
to
46%
of
all
food
purchases
carry
with
them
food
stamps
and
there
is
testimony
in
the
record
and
i
think
it
is
well
justified.
housewives
feel
that
they
pay
for
these
stamps
and
the
witnesses
who
testified
felt
that
they
should
have
a
right
to
deal
with
them
substantially
as
they
wished
and
not
to
be
restricted
in
something
that
they
had
paid
for.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
no
specific
mr.
chief
justice
i
was
quoting
from
the
testimony
of
one
of
the
witnesses.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
think
it
would.
chief
justice,
on
the
other
hand,
i
think
where
we
follow
the
standard
on
judicial
review,
if
we
look
for
warrant
in
the
record
and
reason
in
law
and
i
think
there
is
warrant
in
the
record.
this
count
three
came
at
the
end
of
the
very
long
opinion
that
dealt
in
many
respects
with
this
whole
stamp
business
and
restrictive
practices
that
s&h
used
and
the
fact
i
think
that
count
three
does
not
fully
contain
every
little
finding
should
not
be
read
in
isolation
but
rather
the
opinion
should
be
looked
at
as
a
whole
and
as
well
as
the
fact
that
there
is
record
support
for
these
propositions
that
i
think
are
inherent
in
the
lengthy
findings
and
the
opinion
of
the
prosecution.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
well,
the
heart
of
the
case
is
double
findings
that
there
is
an
adverse
effect
on
competition,
that
there
is
an
adverse
effect
on
the
consuming
public.
i
think
that
that
if
the
commission
had
taken
the
approach
solely
of
going
by
the
proposition
of
the
legal
consequence
of
s&h
having
eliminated
these
outlets
and
focussed
entirely
on
the
fact
that
now
all
these
outlets
are
out
of
the
way,
they
have
this
restriction
in
the
book
that
says
you
do
not
own
the
stamp
and
so
on
and
so
on.
we
find
that
just
an
ultimate
finding,
this
has
prevented
consumers
from
dealing
freely
with
stamps.
this
is
an
unfair
method
of
competition
or
an
unfair
trade
practice.
i
think
that
would
have
been
enough
but
they
did
both.
on
the
way
to
that
finding,
on
the
way
to
the
consumer
finding
they
said
this
has
an
adverse
effect
on
competition
that
in
effect
will
support
an
unfair
holding.
they
are
supported
both
ways
and
i
do
not
think
that
say
should
be
folded
simply
because
they
did
not
spell
out
the
fact
that
here
and
they
are
along
the
way.
this
effect
and
not
effect
on
the
consumer,
the
effect
on
the
consumer
was
tied
in
with
the
effect
on
the
competition.
the
two
things,
the
restrictive
provision
in
the
stamp
and
the
elimination
of
the
places
where
you
could
trade
the
stamps.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
think
it
need
not
be
ignored
mr.
justice
stewart
and
i
think
that
there
is
a
solid
finding
and
it
is
a
finding
at
page
126
that
way.
it
is
not
a
conclusion.
it
is
a
finding
and
then
they
went
on
and
they
concluded
that
the
effect
of
all
of
this
was
anti-competitive
in
contrary
to
this.
thank
you.
