justice
potter
stewart
mr.
mclaren?
may
i
interrupt
you
with
a
question.
the
federal
trade
commissions
opinion,
both
the
opinion
of
commission
by
commissioner
mcintyre
is
concurrent
with
commissioner
elman
of
the
defense
seem
primarily
concerned
with
this
one
for
ten
policy.
one
per
ten
ratio
of
policy,
has
that
dropped
out
of
this
case
entirely.
i
gather
from
the
brief
here
is
not
an
issue
before
us
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see,
that
was
the
only
count.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
the
concurring
opinion
of
commissioner
elman
and
the
dissenting
opinion
do
not
really
direct
themselves
to
count
three
in
any
explicit
kind
of
way
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
industry
wide
study.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
so
there
was
no
appeal
by
s&h
on
finding
suggested
on
counts
one
and
two?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart

are
these
findings
in
the
appendix,

page?
justice
potter
stewart

page

--
justice

stewart
page

finding
89?
justice
potter
stewart
all
right,
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
the
effects
found
by
the
examiner?
justice
potter
stewart
alright
justice
potter
stewart
did
the
commission's
order
have
anything
to
do
with
redemption
for
cash
which
i
understand
as
required
in
two
states
wisconsin
and
wyoming
and
16
other
states
require
that
the
purchaser
have
an
option
of
doing
so,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
trading
stamp.
no
part
of
that
question
is
before
us?
justice
potter
stewart
i
did
not
quite
understand.
what
was
the
supposed
unfair
practice
that
appears
on
the
legislative
history?
justice
potter
stewart
who
in
the
view
of
the
congressman
who
refer
to
this
which
who
is
being
unfair;
s&h
or
mr.
weber?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
weber
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
think
mr.
mclaren
that
in
reading
commissioner
mcintyre’s
opinion
for
the
commission
reading
that
part
of
it
which
refers
to
issues
rise
under
count
three
which
is
the
only
part.
the
only
issue
directly
before
us
now
but
nonetheless
we
should
sort
of
assume
that
there
is
an
implicit
incorporation
by
reference
of
the
discussion
in
the
earlier
part
of
its
opinion
which
is
the
lion
share
of
the
opinion,
is
that
your
point
now?
