unknown
speaker
mr.
moldenhauer,
i
supposed
this
compact
means
that
this
particular
litigation
is
not
a
boundary
dispute?
unknown
speaker
so,
it's
rather
unusual
as
compared
with
--
unknown
speaker
so,
this
is
in
essence
is
a
suit
to
enforce
a
compact?
unknown
speaker
was
that
approved
by
congress?
unknown
speaker
and,
that
i
take
it,
requires
a
construction
of
compact,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
but,
nothing
that
you're
requesting
involves
a
dispute
as
to
where
the
iowa-nebraska
boundary
is
now,
under
the
constitution.
unknown
speaker
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
lands
about
which
this
controversy
swirls
are
conceded
all
to
be
in
iowa,
are
they
not?
unknown
speaker
one
last
question,
the
state
of
nebraska
is
here
really
as
it
has
been
suggested
attempting
to
enforce
the
compact?
unknown
speaker
are
you
also
here
as
parens
patriae?
unknown
speaker
if
in
fact,
iowa
had
breached
the
provision
of
the
compact,
does
nebraska
have
a
right
to
rescission?
have
a
remedy
of
rescission?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
i
gather
your
position
is
that
the
remedy,
if
there's
been
a
breached
by
iowa
must
be
specific
performance.
unknown
speaker
and
whoever
might
obtain
it
in
whatever
court,
i
take
it,
is
conceded
that
federal
law
is
to
govern.
as
long
as
there's
a
remedy
and
if
the
compact
is
enforceable
by
somebody,
the
construction
of
compact
is
a
matter
of
[voice
overlap]?
unknown
speaker
but
presumably
in
iowa,
a
landholder
could
claim
under
the
compact,
could
he
not
if
iowa
is
seeking
the
quiet
title
to
his
land,
and
he
claims
the
compact
[voice
overlap]?
unknown
speaker
he
could
be
a
third
party
beneficiary
of
the
compact.
unknown
speaker
you're
right
on
the
compact,
he
can
raise
that
same
point
in
his
own
litigation
and
say
that
iowa
has
not
right
to
go
back
behind
1943.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
[voice
overlap]
unknown
speaker
you'd
have
a
just
compensation
above,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
but
iowa
was
promised
referred
to
ceded
land.
unknown
speaker
and,
under
ceded
lands,
do
you
think
are
those
that
nebraska
would
have
recognized
before
1943?
unknown
speaker
without
the
necessity
of
proving
whether
nebraska
was
right
or
not
in
recognizing
--
unknown
speaker
you're
saying
if
a
party
for
instance
had
a
proper
chain
of
title
in
the
nebraska
law
and
presented
that
to
the
iowa
courts,
iowa
should
recognize
it?
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
mr.
moldenhauer,
nebraska
as
a
proprietor
of
land
isn't
involved
in
this
dispute
at
all?
unknown
speaker
but
the
basis
for
the
bringing
of
your
suit
is
here
is
the
original
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
isn't
it
there's
nothing
added
to
that
jurisdiction
by
the
provision
for
interstate
compacts?
so
far
is
jurisdiction
is
concerned.
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
then
that
this
court
had
original
jurisdiction,
should
exercise
original
jurisdiction
of
every
single
claim
that
might
be
made
under
an
interstate
compact?
unknown
speaker
but
do
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
rest
on
the
fact
that
the
parties
are
two
sovereign
states?
not
on
the
fact
that
there's
a
controversy
about
a
compact.
unknown
speaker
but
whether
or
not
they
have,
we
would
have
exclusive
and
original
jurisdiction
of
this
lawsuit,
because
it
is
a
lawsuit
between
two
states,
whether
the
substance
of
the
lawsuit
goes
out
of
an
interstate
compact,
or
goes
out
of
common
law
--
unknown
speaker
it
has
to
be
a
controversy.
unknown
speaker
it
has
to
be
a
case
of
controversy
and
you
say
it's
a
case
of
controversy
because
your
contractual
right
for
which
you
gave
in
consideration
are
at
issue?
unknown
speaker
mr.
moldenhauer,
how
do
you
distinguish
this
case
from
the
old
dakota,
north
carolina
bond
case
where
in
effect,
the
south
dakota
gave
consideration
for
the
north
carolina
bond,
sued
on
them
and
this
court
declined
to
exercise
jurisdiction,
because
it
said
north
carolina
that
south
dakota
is
basically
suing
on
behalf
of
its
residence,
even
though
it
would
have
had
the
nominal
title
to
the
bond.
unknown
speaker
but,
there's
no
dispute
here
as
to
the
boundary,
between
nebraska
islands?
unknown
speaker
it
might
very
well
be,
if
you
can't
get
what
you
bargained
for.
unknown
speaker
you'll
be
up
here
with
the
original
boundary
line
suit.
unknown
speaker
but
is
there
any
real
dispute
as
to
the
present
boundary
between
the
state
of
nebraska
and
the
state
of
iowa
under
this
compact?
unknown
speaker
did
we
argue
these
matters
before?
unknown
speaker
when
you
argued
this
one,
there
was
a
case
of
controversy?
unknown
speaker
that
was
back
in
1965?
unknown
speaker
and
we
granted
you
the
file?
unknown
speaker
so,
we'll
cross
the
bridge,
when
[voice
overlap]
unknown
speaker
i
just
assume
for
the
moment
that
if
it
were
admitted
and
perfectly
clear
that
iowa
was
breaching
the
contract,
you
would
still
make
the
same
argument
here
as
far
as
disability
was
concerned?
unknown
speaker
that
nebraska,
since
it
has
no
proprietary
interest,
stands
to
gain
no
dollars
in
the
sense,
has
no
judiciable
interest
in
enforcing
the
terms
of
the
compact,
which
is
entered
into
as
iowa.
and,
has
not
brought
herself
within
the
rules
of
parens
patriae?
unknown
speaker
that
just
a
fact
that
it
contracted
with
iowa
is
not
enough?
unknown
speaker
that
a
contracting
party
doesn't
automatically
have
standing
to
enforce
the
compact,
even
though
it
gave
consideration?
unknown
speaker
mr.
murray,
the
consequence
of
your
approach
is
then
that
the
bed
of
the
river
in
those
parts
ceded
would
actually
vested
in
the
state
of
iowa.
unknown
speaker
whereas
before
it
had
been
owned
by
a
nebraska
riparian
owner
subject
to
--
unknown
speaker
but,
if
you're
trying
to
find
out
what
nebraska
law
is,
the
next
best
thing
to
a
holding
of
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
will
be
dicta
to
supreme
court
of
nebraska,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
was
the
compact
pleaded
in
that
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
indded
do
you
think
that
if
nebraska's
right
on
the
construction
of
compact,
let's
assume
the
special
master
is
right
on
his
construction
and
your
exception
is
overruled,
would
the
provision
of
the
compact
be
a
defense
in
a
suit
like
the
case
you
just
mentioned?
unknown
speaker
you
don't.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
don't
think
the
individual
landowners
have
any
rights
to
claim
under
the
compact?
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
assume
that
the
master
is
right
on
his
construction
of
the
compact.
unknown
speaker
that
would
iowa
lose
its
suits
against
these
individual
landowners?
unknown
speaker
has
the
compact
ever
been
raised
in
any
of
these
iowa
suits
in
court?
have
compact
rights
have
ever
been
asserted
by
private
landowners?
unknown
speaker
should
the
compact
be
available
to
them?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
special
master
is
right
in
his
construction
of
the
compact,
if
you
were
the
lawyer
for
tyson,
wouldn't
you
plead
it?
unknown
speaker
yes
well
the
master
held
that.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
but
nebraska
does?
unknown
speaker
what's
the
same
thing
as
the
presumption
in
favor
of
accretion
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
