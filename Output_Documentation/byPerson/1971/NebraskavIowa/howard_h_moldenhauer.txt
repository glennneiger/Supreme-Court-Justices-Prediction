mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
nebraska's
contention
that
the
state
of
iowa
has
violated
the
iowa-nebraska
boundary
compact
of
1943.
in
order
to
properly
evaluate
the
contentions
of
the
state
of
nebraska,
we
feel
it's
essential
at
first
we
have
to
examine
into
the
situation
as
it
existed
in
1943
and
in
prior
years.
the
case
of
nebraska
versus
iowa
decided
in
1892
determined
the
originally
the
boundaries
between
the
two
states
was
the
center
of
the
main
channel
of
the
missouri
river.
and
the
boundary
moved
with
changes
of
the
channel,
when
these
changes
were
gradual
and
imperceptible
but
when
they
were
sudden
or
by
avulsion,
then
the
boundary
remained
in
the
bed
of
the
abandoned
channel.
these
principles
applied
at
that
time,
both
to
state
and
private
boundaries.
there's
no
dispute
down
through
the
years
and
missouri
river
was
very
notorious
for
all
of
its
periodic
flooding
and
many
natural
changes.
and
it
was
common
knowledge
that
at
many
times
that
it
changed
its
course
and
had
had
physically
dissevered
lands
from
one
state
and
left
them
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
and
this
created
all
kinds
of
problems
in
determining
a
jurisdiction,
titles,
which
schools
children
should
go
to,
and
taxation.
and
the
legislative
history
of
both
states
is
replete
with
recognition
of
these
problems
and
the
legislatures
had
boundary
commissions
from
1901
through
1943.
commencing
at
about
1934,
on
top
of
this
already
confused
situation
along
the
river,
the
u.s.
army
corps
of
engineers
set
out
to
create
a
new
and
stabilized
channel
for
the
missouri
river.
this
channel
was
supposed
to
be
700
feet
wide
and
was
prepared
on
the
drawing
boards.
and
then
the
corps
of
engineers
said
the
construction
dikes
and
revetments
set
about
to
place
the
river
in
that
channel.
and
commencing
in
1938,
they
also
dug
canals
to
physically
place
the
river
in
the
channel.
these
canals
consisted
in
many
cases
initially
of
a
ditch,
dug
on
dry
land
and
then,
they
opened
or
pulled
the
plug
at
the
top
and
allowed
the
water
to
go
through
when
it
scoured
out
through
that
dry
land
the
new
channel.
at
that
time,
the
corps,
when
it
moved
the
river,
moved
it
around
islands,
around
barren
areas,
and
through
bank
area.
and
it
created
or
further
confusion
in
so
far
as
boundary
problems
were
concerned,
but
the
corps,
when
it
channelized
the
river,
paid
no
attention
to
the
boundary,
it
was
not
concerned
with
this,
it
was
concerned
in
confining
the
river
and
stopping
the
flooding
and
improving
navigation.
by
1943,
the
corps
had
dredged
canals
of
at
least
11
locations
and
nebraska
feels
that
the
evidence
shows
at
least
15
places,
but
that
really
is
not
important,
there
were
several
canals,
which
they
have
dug.
and
in
1943,
south
of
omaha,
the
river
was
99%
in
its
design
channel
to
the
nebraska
border,
and
north
of
omaha,
it
was
approximately
78%
in
the
design
channel.
but,
this
river
worked
by
the
corps
had
further
compounded
many
the
title
problems
which
existed.
in
1943,
then
the
states,
under
the
assumption
that
the
river
was
finally
stabilized,
entered
into
a
compact
to
settle
their
boundary,
and
at
that
time
we
think
the
facts
are
very
significant,
because
at
that
time,
each
state
and
the
master
so
found,
recognized
that
the
shifts
of
the
channel
in
the
past
had
been
so
numerous
and
intricate
that
for
practically
all
land
adjacent
to
the
river,
there
were
no
conclusive
determination
of
either
state
or
private
boundaries
was
considered
passable.
they
both
recognized
that
in
many
places
the
boundary
line
was
not
located
in
missouri
river.
and
that
these
places
had
not
been
determined
and
were
almost
impossible
of
determination.
and
if
a
compromised
couldn't
be
worked
out
and
if
they
have
to
make
a
determination,
where
the
boundary
had
been
fixed
on
dry
land,
it
would
be
an
extremely
complicated
and
an
expensive
process.
at
this
time
and
prior
to
this
time,
the
state
of
iowa
was
making
no
claim
to
abandon
river
beds
or
islands
arising
in
the
bed
of
the
missouri
river
and
under
any
common
law
claim
of
sovereign
ownership.
in
1932,
they
have
purchased
some
land
in
an
abandon
river
bed,
in
a
well-known
avulsion
of
the
lake
manawa,
just
south
of
council
bluffs,
iowa.
and
they
were
not
claiming
islands
which
existed
south
of
omaha,
where
the
river
had
been
entirely
in
the
design
channel,
since
at
least
about
1938.
there
were
abandoned
channels
in
oxbows
all
up
and
down
the
missouri
river,
on
both
sides
of
missouri
river.
and
iowa
had
made
no
claim
to
these
abandoned
channels
on
oxbows
on
either
side.
there
was
a
case
in
1938
and
the
nebraska
district
court,
which
was
eventually,
decided
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eight
circuit
called
u.s.
v.
flower,
where
the
court
found
an
avulsion
in
nebraska
land
on
the
iowa
side
of
the
river.
and
iowa
was
a
party
to
that
case
at
one
time
in
the
district
court,
and
then
the
court
allowed
her
to
withdraw,
she
did,
but
she
never
came
in
and
claim
that
abandoned
channel.
the
iowa
code,
during
all
of
these
period
required
that
the
secretary
of
state
was
a
state
land
office
and
would
maintain
in
separate
track
books
the
areas
of
lands
which
the
state
may
now
own
or
may
hereafter
own,
so
that
there
would
be
a
separate
record
of
the
lands
in
state
ownership.
iowa
had
no
record
of
any
state-owned
lands
along
the
missouri
river
or
lands
which
she
used
to
claim
at
a
future
date.
the
iowa
coast,
since
1923
had
provided
that
the
conversation
commission
would
mark
its
boundaries,
in
cases,
where
the
jurisdiction
or
the
boundaries
of
its
jurisdiction
is
privately
owned
property.
and
then
in
1931
or
1932,
they
added
with
the
commission
deemed
at
feasible,
but
they
had
not
marked
boundaries
along
the
river
where
the
commission
property
supposedly
commenced
and
where
the
landowners'
property
limits
were
terminated.
again,
the
master
found
and
we
think
properly
the
states
didn't
know
where
the
boundary
was
located
and
they
didn't
care.
and
neither
states
thought
it
was
necessary
in
order
to
settle
their
problems
to
identify
or
pinpoint,
where
the
boundary
was
at
any
particular
location.
there
were
lands
taxed
in
nebraska,
which
were
on
the
iowa
side
or
the
left
bank
side
of
the
river,
as
you
look
down
the
stream.
there
were
some
lands
on
the
right
bank,
or
nebraska
side,
which
were
recognizably
in
iowa.
nebraskans
were
in
possession
and
claiming
many
of
these
lands
and
lands
on
the
nebraska
side.
iowans
were
in
possession
in
claiming
and
some
of
those
possessions
came
from
some
claim
of
a
record
title,
others
might
have
been
commenced
just
with
open
notorious
adverse
possession
which
was
possible
under
nebraska
law.
the
two
states
entered
into
the
compact
in
1943
to
settle
all
these
chaos
and
confusion
and
as
the
master
found
to
accomplish
the
general
purpose
of
settling
and
laying
the
risk,
the
boundary
and
jurisdictional
problems
which
existed
between
the
states.
and
he
found
they
intended
to
settle
all
of
their
problems
arising
from
the
indefinite
nature
of
this
boundary
and
from
the
work
by
the
corps
in
channelizing
the
boundary.
now,
following
the
compact
and
before
we
go
into
the
terms
of
compact,
we
think
this
is
also
significant.
parties
in
possession
on
the
left
bank
or
iowa
side,
continued
to
exercise
ownership
without
disturbance
from
the
state
of
iowa.
in
many
instances
the
land
was
placed
on
the
tax
rules
of
the
state
of
iowa.
some
plant
land
was
placed
in
the
government
farm
program.
it
was
clear,
some
of
it
was
improved.
in
1946,
owners
of
one
of
the
areas
about
which
a
great
deal
of
evidence
was
introduced,
nottleman
island
or
bouvet
(ph)
island
brought
a
lawsuit
against
the
county
officials
to
have
it
placed
on
the
tax
rules.
their
attorney
mr.
whitney
gilliland
who
was
presently
with
the
civil
aeronautics
board
had
notified
the
attorney's
general
office
of
the
problem.
they
have
discussed
it
and
the
court
found
that
they
claimed
the
land
through
nebraska
titles
and
an
issue
of
ownership,
ordered
mills
county
out
with
places
on
the
tax
rules
and
it
was
taxed
thereafter
--
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
that's
correct
your
honor,
this
litigation
is
based
upon
the
compact
itself
and
because
nebraska
was
a
contracting
party
to
the
compact.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
we
think
that
it's
highly
unusual
and
there's
very
little
precedent
directly
in
point,
involving
this
situation.
we
think
the
facts
here,
your
honor
are
very
unique
and
this
case
really
hinges
on
the
facts
as
they
exist.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
it
is
your
honor,
specifically.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
that's
correct
your
honor,
and
i
want
to
get
into
the
terms
of
the
compact,
after
i
get
a
little
bit
of
this
--
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
yes
sir,
your
honor.
the
construction
or
interpretation
it
really
involves
the
same
thing.
it's
a
question
of
what
does
the
compact
mean
and
what
effect
did
it
have?
if
we
had
not
entered
in
the
compact,
we
would
not
be
here.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
your
honor
that
is
not
the
basis
for
this
suit.
it
will
come
up
that
there
may
be
a
lot
of
uncertainty,
but
it
is
a
part
of
the
compact,
we're
not
claiming
it
though,
as
the
basis
for
our
appearance
in
this
court.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
your
honor,
they
are
conceded
to
be
in
iowa
now
because
of
the
compact
and
because
the
compact
placed
them
there.
and
we
think
this
is
a
very
critical
point.
in
any
event,
there
were
other
instances
after
the
compact,
where
iowa
either
disclaimed
land
in
an
abandoned
channel
and
they
did
so
in
1956
in
the
lawsuit.
in
winnebago
bend
where
they
disclaimed
land
and
in
1959
in
california
bend
where
the
court
dug
another
cutoff
and
iowa
appeared
in
the
lawsuit
and
did
not
assert
a
title,
or
was
not
successful
in
asserting
title
to
abandon
channel,
which
existed.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
yes
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
if
so,
it's
just
an
incidental
effect
because
this
involves
our
190-mile
boundary.
and
we
do
contend
that
iowa's
conduct,
which
i
will
describe
in
a
minute,
puts
in
question
and
uncertainty
all
of
the
190-mile
boundary
and
really
impedes
development
of
the
riverfront.
but
we
are
here
because
of
the
compact
and
what
we
agreed
to.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
yes,
we
thought
about
that.
i've
never
seen
any
cases,
where
state
was
successful
in
rescinding
a
compact
approved
by
congress
and
if
that
happened
we
would
have
a
far
greater
mess
than
we
have
got
now.
and,
i
don't
know
where
we'd
end
up
and
we
didn't
think
that
as
a
state,
we
can
ask
for
rescission.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
it
must
be
your
honor,
in
the
form
of
injunctive
relief.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
yes,
sir.
your
honor,
we
feel
it's
only
enforceable
in
this
court
because
it's
an
original
action
between
the
two
states.
and
we
don't
think
iowa
can
make
her
own
determination,
as
to
what
her
commitment
is.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
oh!
yes
sir,
it's
not
based
on
his
citizenship.
it
is
based
upon
what
iowa
agreed
to
and
what
she
agreed
to
recognize.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
yes,
sir.
they
definitely
could
be
a
third
party
beneficiary.
we
do
think
that
the
facts
in
the
case
are
pretty
clearly
shown
though
that
he
cannot
effectively
defend
himself
or
protect
himself,
because
this
river
moved
across
three
or
four
miles.
he
didn't
have
a
chain
of
title,
like
i
have
in
my
house,
where
i
have
had
one
piece
of
property
for
60
years.
it
could
have
been
accretion
at
one
time
to
this
section,
or
this
section,
or
this
section,
or
the
section,
as
the
river
moved
over.
as
it
went
back,
they
could
re-establish
the
sections,
they
could
call
accretion
of
this
section,
and
the
river
could
be
drawn
over
here,
it
could
have
be
three
or
four
sections
described
as
accretion
to
this
one.
or
they
could
be
placed
on
his
tax
lawsuits.
it's
a
tremendously
complicated
process.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
he
can
raise
it.
yes,
your
honor.
the
problem
is
that
they
have
not
effectively
been
able
to
raise
it
in
the
past.
there's
an
iowa
decision,
which
said
for
instance
in
dartmouth
college
case,
the
compact
had
no
effect
upon
private
titles.
but
we
think
we
can
show
it
did
have
an
effect
upon
private
titles.
in
1961,
iowa
came
out
with
a
missouri
river
planning
report
and
i
believe
the
master
forward
copies
to
this
court,
which
was
a
first
document
where
they
publicly
announced
a
policy
of
claiming
lands
on
the
river.
and
there
is
an
evidence
how
they
selected
these
areas.
they
made
no
investigation
of
any
nebraska
titles.
they
didn't
talk
to
the
landowners.
they
assumed
anybody
in
possession
was
a
trespasser.
if
somebody
raised
the
nebraska
title,
they
automatically
called
it
a
spurious
and
fictitious
title.
and
all
of
a
sudden,
all
these
farmers,
who
have
these
lands
since
1963
or
farming
it
found
they
were
under
attack
by
the
state
of
iowa.
they
couldn't
borrow
on
their
land,
which
in
partly
the
operation
tremendously
difficult
and
they
couldn't
understand
the
situation
they've
been
placed
in.
now,
going
back
to
the
compact,
which
was
a
compromise.
first,
it
was
an
agreement
between
the
two
states
and
iowa
bound
herself
in
this
compact.
the
first
section,
established
the
boundary
and
it
established
it
in
the
middle
of
this
main
channel,
as
it
appear
on
the
corps
of
engineer
maps.
this
made
the
boundary
a
fixed
line.
it
changed
the
boundary
between
the
states
from
a
movable
boundary,
in
every
case
to
a
fix
line
on
the
geographic
center.
now,
in
most
instances,
that
navigable
channel,
where
the
river
was
still
the
boundary
had
followed
the
outside
of
the
bends
and
it
cross
back
and
forth
as
it
flowed
down
the
river.
so
that
what
compact
did
was
change
the
location
of
that
boundary,
and
it
changed
it
to
a
fix
line,
so
it
changed
the
state's
right.
one
of
the
issues
is
did
this
change
the
private
riparian
owner's
right.
and
we
don't
think
that
by
changing
our
state
line,
we
change
the
line
of
the
private
owners,
because
we
think
that
their
lines
should
have
stayed
the
same.
we
didn't
take
away
their
right,
which
was
a
vested
property
right.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
pardon
me?
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
absolutely,
but
there's
been
no
provision
for
compensation
under
anything
while
it's
done.
she's
done
it
supposedly
under
her
common
law
and
this
is
the
basis
for
planning
report,
that
in
iowa,
the
common
law
provides
that
the
state
own
the
beds
of
navigable
rivers.
in
nebraska,
the
principle
is
always
been
that
the
state
has
a
public
easement
for
navigation,
but
riparian
owner
owns
it
and
this
includes
accretion
to
the
bed
of
that
river.
but,
section
1
changed
the
situation
all
along
the
boundaries.
so,
land
in
its
very
strict
technical
sense
was
transferred
back
and
forth,
all
along
that
river.
then,
in
section
2
of
course
they
recognize
the
lands
on
each
side
were
ceded
and
they
really
operated
language
in
sections
3
and
4.
in
section
3,
they
said
basically
titles,
mortgages,
and
other
liens
good
in
nebraska,
shall
be
good
in
iowa,
as
to
lands
nebraska
shall
cede
to
iowa
any
pending
suits
could
be
prosecuted
final
judgment.
iowa
says,
oh
yes,
you've
got
to
prove
it
was
good
in
nebraska,
before
we
have
to
recognize
the
title.
our
contention
is
iowa,
you
agreed
in
the
context,
where
you
were
making
no
claims.
you
agreed
in
a
context,
where
you
recognized
the
uncertain
situations.
you
agreed
in
a
context,
where
you
didn't
want
to
find
the
boundary,
you
wanted
to
avoid
it.
in
a
compact
should
be
construed
as
the
master
read
it,
to
cover
all
lands
in
the
situation,
which
existed
along
the
river
in
1943,
because
that's
what
they
were
referring
to.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
it
says,
as
to
lands
shall
be
good
in
iowa,
as
to
any
lands
in
nebraska
may
cede
to
iowa,
as
to
any
lands
nebraska
--
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
yes
sir,
without
the
necessity
of
determining
where
the
boundary
actually
was.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
right
your
honor,
because
everybody
recognize
the
confused
situation
and
the
difficulty
of
determining
where
the
actual
boundary
was.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
yes
sir,
your
honor.
recognizing
again,
that
that
proper
chain
of
title
may
consist
of
some
possessory
rights
or
a
very
difficult,
what
some
people
may
call
it
paper
title,
that
because
you
don't
have
a
paper
title.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
so,
we
don't
feel
that
iowa
can
conduct
herself,
because
she
agreed
that
they're
good.
but
then
she
come
and
attacked
them
and
we
say
this
is
binding
on
her
courts,
on
her
legislative
and
executive
branches.
so
she
can't
say
we
are
going
to
go
and
determine
our
courts,
because
our
courts
are
also
bound
by
what
are
commitment
was.
that
is
one
basic
proposition.
now,
there
was
also
--
you
see
section
3,
we
feel
was
language
of
recognition
of
a
situation
in
private
titles,
then
the
states
added
section
4,
which
said
that
taxes
for
the
current
year
can
be
levied
on
lands
ceded
to
the
other
state
and
for
one
year.
and
that
any
rights
under
those
taxes,
accrued
or
accruing
would
be
asserted
in
five
years
or
be
forever
barred
in
the
states
would
stop
taxing
across
the
river.
so,
4,
we
feel
was
a
limitation
on
what
the
states
can
do,
3
was
a
recognition
of
private
rights
and
the
states
look
that
this
and
said
now
we
solved
their
problem,
we
have
no
more
problems,
we're
through.
and
we
think
that
this
compact
has
to
be
construed
liberally
to
effectuate
the
intention
for
which
it
was
adopted
and
that
was
to
settle
all
the
problems.
we
agree
with
the
master's
finding
that
in
any
action
by
landowner
or
by
iowa
along
the
river
that
the
landowner
should
not
have
to
prove
where
the
boundary
was
beforehand.
if
he
raises
some
nebraska
title,
iowa
should
have
to
recognize
it.
the
evidence
is
clear
that
iowa
didn't
even
inquire.
and,
when
the
titles
were
raised,
she
has
said
they're
spurious
and
fictitious.
we
go
a
little
further
and
contend
that
iowa
shouldn't
be
able
to
raise
all
these
problems
that
we
ought
to
be
placed
in
a
situation
we
were
in
1943
and
for
at
least
15
years
or
after,
before
iowa
starting
asserting
these
claims.
and
if
that
means
that
iowa
has
to
recognize
the
nebraska
owners
title
to
the
bed,
and
iowa
has
easement
for
public
navigation,
as
nebraska
has
or
it's
all
the
public
has,
she
hasn't
been
deprived
with
anything.
there
were
areas,
where
the
river
was
entirely
in
nebraska,
at
the
time
of
the
compact.
and
in
those
areas,
many
of
which
the
states
did
not
want
to
determine.
our
contention
is
that
the
entire
bed
was
in
nebraska.
and
when
iowa
said
titles
good
nebraska,
shall
be
good
in
iowa.
she
is
recognizing
the
title
to
the
bed,
she
didn't
accept
it.
iowa
position
now
is
we
own
the
entire
bed
because
it's
in
iowa.
another
issue,
which
has
come
up
was
originally
decided
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit,
i
think
it
was
in
november
of
1960,
in
which
another
situation,
where
there's
no
question
about
the
facts
occurred.
the
river
was
in
the
design
channel,
it
moved
out
into
iowa,
land
build
up
behind
it,
and
the
corps
of
engineers
placed
it
back
in
the
design
channel.
this
case
involved
between
$12,000.00
and
$13,000.00
of
damages
condemnation
by
the
corps
of
engineers
for
placing
the
river
back
into
the
design
channel
or
the
boundary.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eight
circuit
said
the
land
is
in
iowa.
iowa
owns
the
bed.
therefore,
iowa
owns
it
and
the
nebraska
riparian
owner
was
deprived
of
his
ownership.
iowa
has
used
that
principle
in
order
to
make
her
claims
to
all
lands,
north
of
omaha.
and
our
position
is
this,
that
when
we
intended
to
settle
this
thing,
we
didn't
change
the
private
property
owner's
boundary,
it
should
have
stayed
the
same,
because
we
couldn't
divest
them
of
their
property
rights
without
due
process
of
law
and
without
compensation.
had
it
not
been
for
the
compact,
when
that
river
moved
into
iowa,
the
nebraska
riparian
owners'
rights,
which
extended
to
the
thalweg
or
thread
of
the
stream
moved
with
it,
because
that's
a
private
property
boundary
matter.
and
it
moved
over
and
when
the
court
put
it
back
without
washing
away
the
intervening
islands,
it
was
an
avulsion,
which
left
that
private
property
boundary
remaining
over
into
iowa
and
the
nebraska
riparian
owner
should
have
had
preserve
to
him
his
right
to
his
accretions.
if
it
is
read
otherwise,
then
we
say
that
nebraska
riparian
owner
has
been
deprived
of
his
property
without
due
process
of
law.
it's
very
easy
to
say,
the
lands
in
iowa,
therefore
iowa
applies,
and
therefore
iowa
owns
it.
but
the
fact
is
what
did
the
parties
agreed
to
and
we
say
iowa
law
is
what
the
compact
provides.
requiring
iowa
to
recognize
private
rights
and
we
say
that
you
have
to
look
and
cede.
you'd
have
to
say
in
the
tyson
case,
but
for
the
compact,
the
boundary
would
have
been
clear
over
into
iowa.
the
states
avoided
the
necessity
of
worrying
about
that
as
between
themselves
but
they
shouldn't
be
able
to
deprive
the
riparian
owner
of
his
rights,
because
of
that,
of
their
agreement.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
no
sir,
your
honor.
we
are
here
because
we
didn't
just
agree
to
a
new
boundary.
if
we
had
section
1
and
said
here's
the
boundary
and
stopped,
it
might
be
a
different
situation,
but
we
said
no,
we
have
3
and
4
here,
where
iowa
have
to
engage
in
certain
conduct
to
assure
us
that
we're
getting
what
we
bargained
for
and
we
agreed
to
the
same
thing
for
you.
iowa
has
to
rely
on
section
1
to
show
the
lands
in
iowa,
that's
the
only
way
she
can
do
it.
and
she
does
rely
in
section,
so
she's
relying
in
part
upon
that
compact
to
establish
jurisdiction.
then,
she
says,
jurisdiction
establishes
our
title,
because
we're
in
iowa
and
we
own
the
bed.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
well,
the
jurisdiction
is
because
we
entered
into
the
compact,
pursuant
to
authority
of
the
constitution.
and
this
is
action
regarding
that
compact
and
when
the
states
came
into
the
union,
they
gave
up
their
right
to
solve
their
problems
in
the
other
way.
and,
when
we
do
it
by
compact,
this
is
the
proper
place
to
tell
us
what
that
compact
means
and
what
conduct
is
proper
pursuant
to
it.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
i
think
essentially
as
between
the
states,
yes.
because
i
think
if
they
can't,
we're
involved
into
specific
one,
but
if
they
can't,
there
no
place
else
where
they
can
go
to
solve
their
problems.
and,
if
they
can't
enforce
their
problems
somewhere,
there's
no
incentive
to
enter
into
compacts
at
all.
and
this
court
has
often
suggested
courts
try
to
settle
their
problems,
by
entering
into
a
compact.
this
is
what
we
did,
we
think
it
settled
our
problems,
we
think
that
the
court
should
tell
the
state
of
iowa
and
everyone
that
this
is
how
it
settled
it
and
this
is
what
you
can
do
pursuant
to
it.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
oh
no!
it
rests
on
the
fact
that
the
parties
are
two
sovereign
states
and
they
entered
into
agreement
pursuant
to
the
constitution
--
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
essentially
correct
your
honor,
but
it
has
to
be
a
controversy.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
that's
correct.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
that's
correct,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
your
honor,
that
may
be
that
the
nominal
title
may
be
the
distinction.
in
this
case
it
involved
our
boundary
which
has
also
been
a
matter
of
state
interest
and
when
the
nations
were
or
states
were
admitted
in
the
union,
controversy
as
to
boundary
and
agreements
as
to
boundary
were
in
existence
in
traditional
and
historical.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
no,
because
we
agreed
to
where
it
was,
but
we
didn't
just
say
--
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
that's
right,
if
we
can't
get
what
we
bargained
for,
although
nebraska
would
never
--
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
well,
i
know
nebraska
would
never
bear
arms.
i
don't
about
the
farmers
here.[laughter
attempt]
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
there's
a
real
question
of
where
it
is,
because
the
documents
they
used
in
defining
it
that
were
so
general
that
they
didn't
have
a
sufficient
data
to
allow
a
surveyor
laid
on
the
ground.
that
is
not
why
we're
here.
that's
another
aid
in
construction
your
honor
that
they
used
a
very
general
agreement
to
generally
settle,
because
they
didn't
lay
it
on
the
ground.
they
use
maps
that
are,
like
road
maps,
almost.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
we
argued
everything
your
honor,
because
--
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
yes
sir
and
we
had
a
two-hour
argument
and
we
--
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
1965
and
we
went
through
the
whole
thing
--
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
and
you
granted
[voice
overlap]
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
in
fact
your
honor
at
that
time
i
made
the
comment,
and
i'll
never
forget
it
that
this
is
mr.
justice
brennan
said,
"isn't
true
that
this
is
an
action
to
enforce
a
compact?"
i
said,
"yes
your
honor,
maybe
you
ought
to
say
that
and
sit
down."
and
he
looked
at
me
and
said,
"maybe
you
ought
it."
but,
we
had
to
give
you
the
full
picture,
because
we
did
not
want
them
mislead
this
court.
and
i
don't
think
we
did
mislead
them,
we
feel
that
it
is
necessary
to
settle
this,
because
there
are
approximately
47
miles
at
the
present
time,
where
the
river
is
not
located
in
the
boundary.
it's
moved
out
north
of
omaha
and
unless
we
find
out
what
we
agreed
to
in
1943,
it's
almost
going
to
prevent
at
another
agreement,
which
is
necessary.
and
the
present
situation
we
feel
impedes
the
development
of
lands
along
the
missouri
river
and
it
really
results
in
the
government
of
men
and
not
of
laws
along
the
missouri
river.
your
honor,
i
wish
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
may
it
please
the
court.
one
thing
that
we
think
it's
important
to
analyze
is
a
fact,
which
iowa
apparently
is
overlooked
and
that
is
that
when
they
entered
into
compact,
they
changed
the
laws
along
the
river
to
a
fix
boundary.
now,
all
the
five
previous
riparian
laws
were
based
upon
the
fact
that
when
a
person
is
subject
to
having
his
property
taken
away
by
moving
one
of
the
river,
he
is
subject
to
having
it
added
to,
as
the
river
goes
the
other
way.
and
that
is
the
rationale
for
all
of
those
arguments,
there
isn't
going
to
be
any
decision,
which
said
you
can
accrete
across
the
state
line,
usually
where
you
have
a
movable
boundary,
because
a
movable
boundary
is
the
same
for
the
state
as
it
is
for
the
private
riparian
owners.
but
now
we've
changed
the
situation,
we
entered
into
a
compact
with
a
fix
line
and
i
think
that
requires
an
analysis
then
of,
is
the
rationale
still
there?
iowa
cites
all
these
early
common
law
cases
and
said
this
has
always
been
the
common
law
and
we
don't
dispute
that.
and
in
those
situations
there
were
presumptions,
we
can't
dispute
that,
but
we
can't
say
we
sat
down
in
1943
and
superimposed
the
new
situation
by
contract.
and
this
changed
everything
required
by
examination.
iowa
likes
to
use
the
presumption
that
the
river
moved
gradually
into
its
location
and
would
argue
from
that,
that
therefore
in
1943
the
river
was
the
boundary.
but
the
master's
findings
negate
that
fact
and
the
facts
and
all
the
mass
of
evidence
in
this
case
negates
that
fact.
and
if
the
presumption
was
that
there
was
a
boundary,
we
didn't
need
a
boundary
compact.
we
recognize
it
wasn't
the
boundary
and
the
master
so
specifically
found.
iowa
utilized
the
presumptions
in
this
manner
and
she
did
so
in
the
schemmel
case,
which
started
trial
in
1964.
and
then
trial
has
been
postponed
until
the
decision
in
this
case.
but
she
offered
evidence
with
two
witnesses
in
the
schemmel
case
and
rested.
and
then
i
think
we've
quoted
it
in
the
briefs
somewhere,
counsel
stated
originally
that,
initially,
they
are
going
to
rely
on
the
presumption
of
gradual
movement
of
the
river
into
its
present
location.
so
anything
on
the
eastern
or
left
bank
side
would
be
in
iowa.
at
the
same
time,
in
interrogatories
in
this
case,
iowa
admitted
that
she
knew
that
a
canal
was
dug
in
nebraska
in
1938,
in
that
location
and
yet
she's
relying
on
the
presumptions.
and
the
evidence
in
this
case,
in
the
schemmel
case
shows
a
canal
a
mile
long
placing
the
river
in
the
designed
channel,
along
with
other
movements
by
dikes
and
revetments
in
the
schemmel
area,
but
iowa,
by
being
able
to
utilize
the
presumption
puts
a
tremendous
burden
on
the
landowner
of
coming
back
in
and
having
to
establish
how
the
river
got
there
in
the
past.
this
means
old
documents,
old
witnesses,
evidence
is
gone,
it
has
been
lost
and
destroyed
and
the
corps
of
engineers
itself
was
not
a
record-keeping
body.
and
many
of
its
records
were
thrown
away.
so
it
puts
the
landowner
if
he
got
to
rebut
that
presumption
in
an
extremely
difficult
position
and
extremely
expensive
position.
a
tremendous
amount
of
time
and
effort
has
been
spent
in
getting
evidence
in
this
case;
very
few
farmers
could
afford
that
type
of
litigation
or
defense
of
that
type
of
litigation.
we
say
when
iowa
said
in
compact
that
titles
will
be
good.
again,
we
have
to
determine
which
ones,
but
when
she
says
they're
good,
that
doesn't
mean
that
we
said
we're
going
to
put
you
now
landowner
over
at
iowa,
although
she
admits
they're
good
she
can
attack
your
title
at
any
time
and
put
that
tremendous
burden
upon
you
to
rebut
all
the
presumptions
and
come
in
establish
that
you've
got
a
good
title.
we
don't
think
that
we
send
our
citizens
over
there
to
give
them
a
forum,
which
changes
the
jurisdiction,
and
from
the
change
in
jurisdiction,
a
change
of
ownership
followed.
when
iowa
said
titles
good
in
nebraska,
will
be
good
in
iowa,
we
say
it
had
to
apply
to
the
bed
also
in
both
sides
because
there
were
many
places
where
both
sides
of
that
bed
were
in
nebraska.
she
didn't
say
we're
going
to
accept
that
title
and
take
the
title
of
the
bed.
so,
by
saying
iowa
law
applies,
iowa
law
is
i
owns
the
bed;
it's
negating
completely
iowa's
agreement
that
the
title
to
that
part,
good
in
nebraska
would
be
good
in
iowa.
let
me
conclude
them
by
saying
that
nebraska
is
here
as
contracting
party
with
a
right
to
enforce
the
compact.
iowa
apparently
only
wants
to
enforce
section
1
of
the
compact,
but
we
say
that
if
only
section
1
is
valid,
then
we
have
lost
the
complete
consideration
for
the
remainder
of
our
bargain.
we
feel
that
the
compact
should
be
read
in
the
manner
in
which
it
was
intended
in
1943
and
were
that
great
object
can
be
seen,
it
should
be
effectuated
and
that
was
to
settle
and
later
rest
in
all
of
these
problems,
which
existed
along
the
missouri
river.
thank
you.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
nebraska's
contention
that
the
state
of
iowa
has
violated
the
iowa-nebraska
boundary
compact
of
1943.
in
order
to
properly
evaluate
the
contentions
of
the
state
of
nebraska,
we
feel
it's
essential
at
first
we
have
to
examine
into
the
situation
as
it
existed
in
1943
and
in
prior
years.
the
case
of
nebraska
versus
iowa
decided
in
1892
determined
the
originally
the
boundaries
between
the
two
states
was
the
center
of
the
main
channel
of
the
missouri
river.
and
the
boundary
moved
with
changes
of
the
channel,
when
these
changes
were
gradual
and
imperceptible
but
when
they
were
sudden
or
by
avulsion,
then
the
boundary
remained
in
the
bed
of
the
abandoned
channel.
these
principles
applied
at
that
time,
both
to
state
and
private
boundaries.
there's
no
dispute
down
through
the
years
and
missouri
river
was
very
notorious
for
all
of
its
periodic
flooding
and
many
natural
changes.
and
it
was
common
knowledge
that
at
many
times
that
it
changed
its
course
and
had
had
physically
dissevered
lands
from
one
state
and
left
them
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
and
this
created
all
kinds
of
problems
in
determining
a
jurisdiction,
titles,
which
schools
children
should
go
to,
and
taxation.
and
the
legislative
history
of
both
states
is
replete
with
recognition
of
these
problems
and
the
legislatures
had
boundary
commissions
from
1901
through
1943.
commencing
at
about
1934,
on
top
of
this
already
confused
situation
along
the
river,
the
u.s.
army
corps
of
engineers
set
out
to
create
a
new
and
stabilized
channel
for
the
missouri
river.
this
channel
was
supposed
to
be
700
feet
wide
and
was
prepared
on
the
drawing
boards.
and
then
the
corps
of
engineers
said
the
construction
dikes
and
revetments
set
about
to
place
the
river
in
that
channel.
and
commencing
in
1938,
they
also
dug
canals
to
physically
place
the
river
in
the
channel.
these
canals
consisted
in
many
cases
initially
of
a
ditch,
dug
on
dry
land
and
then,
they
opened
or
pulled
the
plug
at
the
top
and
allowed
the
water
to
go
through
when
it
scoured
out
through
that
dry
land
the
new
channel.
at
that
time,
the
corps,
when
it
moved
the
river,
moved
it
around
islands,
around
barren
areas,
and
through
bank
area.
and
it
created
or
further
confusion
in
so
far
as
boundary
problems
were
concerned,
but
the
corps,
when
it
channelized
the
river,
paid
no
attention
to
the
boundary,
it
was
not
concerned
with
this,
it
was
concerned
in
confining
the
river
and
stopping
the
flooding
and
improving
navigation.
by
1943,
the
corps
had
dredged
canals
of
at
least
11
locations
and
nebraska
feels
that
the
evidence
shows
at
least
15
places,
but
that
really
is
not
important,
there
were
several
canals,
which
they
have
dug.
and
in
1943,
south
of
omaha,
the
river
was
99%
in
its
design
channel
to
the
nebraska
border,
and
north
of
omaha,
it
was
approximately
78%
in
the
design
channel.
but,
this
river
worked
by
the
corps
had
further
compounded
many
the
title
problems
which
existed.
in
1943,
then
the
states,
under
the
assumption
that
the
river
was
finally
stabilized,
entered
into
a
compact
to
settle
their
boundary,
and
at
that
time
we
think
the
facts
are
very
significant,
because
at
that
time,
each
state
and
the
master
so
found,
recognized
that
the
shifts
of
the
channel
in
the
past
had
been
so
numerous
and
intricate
that
for
practically
all
land
adjacent
to
the
river,
there
were
no
conclusive
determination
of
either
state
or
private
boundaries
was
considered
passable.
they
both
recognized
that
in
many
places
the
boundary
line
was
not
located
in
missouri
river.
and
that
these
places
had
not
been
determined
and
were
almost
impossible
of
determination.
and
if
a
compromised
couldn't
be
worked
out
and
if
they
have
to
make
a
determination,
where
the
boundary
had
been
fixed
on
dry
land,
it
would
be
an
extremely
complicated
and
an
expensive
process.
at
this
time
and
prior
to
this
time,
the
state
of
iowa
was
making
no
claim
to
abandon
river
beds
or
islands
arising
in
the
bed
of
the
missouri
river
and
under
any
common
law
claim
of
sovereign
ownership.
in
1932,
they
have
purchased
some
land
in
an
abandon
river
bed,
in
a
well-known
avulsion
of
the
lake
manawa,
just
south
of
council
bluffs,
iowa.
and
they
were
not
claiming
islands
which
existed
south
of
omaha,
where
the
river
had
been
entirely
in
the
design
channel,
since
at
least
about
1938.
there
were
abandoned
channels
in
oxbows
all
up
and
down
the
missouri
river,
on
both
sides
of
missouri
river.
and
iowa
had
made
no
claim
to
these
abandoned
channels
on
oxbows
on
either
side.
there
was
a
case
in
1938
and
the
nebraska
district
court,
which
was
eventually,
decided
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eight
circuit
called
u.s.
v.
flower,
where
the
court
found
an
avulsion
in
nebraska
land
on
the
iowa
side
of
the
river.
and
iowa
was
a
party
to
that
case
at
one
time
in
the
district
court,
and
then
the
court
allowed
her
to
withdraw,
she
did,
but
she
never
came
in
and
claim
that
abandoned
channel.
the
iowa
code,
during
all
of
these
period
required
that
the
secretary
of
state
was
a
state
land
office
and
would
maintain
in
separate
track
books
the
areas
of
lands
which
the
state
may
now
own
or
may
hereafter
own,
so
that
there
would
be
a
separate
record
of
the
lands
in
state
ownership.
iowa
had
no
record
of
any
state-owned
lands
along
the
missouri
river
or
lands
which
she
used
to
claim
at
a
future
date.
the
iowa
coast,
since
1923
had
provided
that
the
conversation
commission
would
mark
its
boundaries,
in
cases,
where
the
jurisdiction
or
the
boundaries
of
its
jurisdiction
is
privately
owned
property.
and
then
in
1931
or
1932,
they
added
with
the
commission
deemed
at
feasible,
but
they
had
not
marked
boundaries
along
the
river
where
the
commission
property
supposedly
commenced
and
where
the
landowners'
property
limits
were
terminated.
again,
the
master
found
and
we
think
properly
the
states
didn't
know
where
the
boundary
was
located
and
they
didn't
care.
and
neither
states
thought
it
was
necessary
in
order
to
settle
their
problems
to
identify
or
pinpoint,
where
the
boundary
was
at
any
particular
location.
there
were
lands
taxed
in
nebraska,
which
were
on
the
iowa
side
or
the
left
bank
side
of
the
river,
as
you
look
down
the
stream.
there
were
some
lands
on
the
right
bank,
or
nebraska
side,
which
were
recognizably
in
iowa.
nebraskans
were
in
possession
and
claiming
many
of
these
lands
and
lands
on
the
nebraska
side.
iowans
were
in
possession
in
claiming
and
some
of
those
possessions
came
from
some
claim
of
a
record
title,
others
might
have
been
commenced
just
with
open
notorious
adverse
possession
which
was
possible
under
nebraska
law.
the
two
states
entered
into
the
compact
in
1943
to
settle
all
these
chaos
and
confusion
and
as
the
master
found
to
accomplish
the
general
purpose
of
settling
and
laying
the
risk,
the
boundary
and
jurisdictional
problems
which
existed
between
the
states.
and
he
found
they
intended
to
settle
all
of
their
problems
arising
from
the
indefinite
nature
of
this
boundary
and
from
the
work
by
the
corps
in
channelizing
the
boundary.
now,
following
the
compact
and
before
we
go
into
the
terms
of
compact,
we
think
this
is
also
significant.
parties
in
possession
on
the
left
bank
or
iowa
side,
continued
to
exercise
ownership
without
disturbance
from
the
state
of
iowa.
in
many
instances
the
land
was
placed
on
the
tax
rules
of
the
state
of
iowa.
some
plant
land
was
placed
in
the
government
farm
program.
it
was
clear,
some
of
it
was
improved.
in
1946,
owners
of
one
of
the
areas
about
which
a
great
deal
of
evidence
was
introduced,
nottleman
island
or
bouvet
(ph)
island
brought
a
lawsuit
against
the
county
officials
to
have
it
placed
on
the
tax
rules.
their
attorney
mr.
whitney
gilliland
who
was
presently
with
the
civil
aeronautics
board
had
notified
the
attorney's
general
office
of
the
problem.
they
have
discussed
it
and
the
court
found
that
they
claimed
the
land
through
nebraska
titles
and
an
issue
of
ownership,
ordered
mills
county
out
with
places
on
the
tax
rules
and
it
was
taxed
thereafter
--
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
that's
correct
your
honor,
this
litigation
is
based
upon
the
compact
itself
and
because
nebraska
was
a
contracting
party
to
the
compact.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
we
think
that
it's
highly
unusual
and
there's
very
little
precedent
directly
in
point,
involving
this
situation.
we
think
the
facts
here,
your
honor
are
very
unique
and
this
case
really
hinges
on
the
facts
as
they
exist.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
it
is
your
honor,
specifically.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
that's
correct
your
honor,
and
i
want
to
get
into
the
terms
of
the
compact,
after
i
get
a
little
bit
of
this
--
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
yes
sir,
your
honor.
the
construction
or
interpretation
it
really
involves
the
same
thing.
it's
a
question
of
what
does
the
compact
mean
and
what
effect
did
it
have?
if
we
had
not
entered
in
the
compact,
we
would
not
be
here.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
your
honor
that
is
not
the
basis
for
this
suit.
it
will
come
up
that
there
may
be
a
lot
of
uncertainty,
but
it
is
a
part
of
the
compact,
we're
not
claiming
it
though,
as
the
basis
for
our
appearance
in
this
court.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
your
honor,
they
are
conceded
to
be
in
iowa
now
because
of
the
compact
and
because
the
compact
placed
them
there.
and
we
think
this
is
a
very
critical
point.
in
any
event,
there
were
other
instances
after
the
compact,
where
iowa
either
disclaimed
land
in
an
abandoned
channel
and
they
did
so
in
1956
in
the
lawsuit.
in
winnebago
bend
where
they
disclaimed
land
and
in
1959
in
california
bend
where
the
court
dug
another
cutoff
and
iowa
appeared
in
the
lawsuit
and
did
not
assert
a
title,
or
was
not
successful
in
asserting
title
to
abandon
channel,
which
existed.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
yes
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
if
so,
it's
just
an
incidental
effect
because
this
involves
our
190-mile
boundary.
and
we
do
contend
that
iowa's
conduct,
which
i
will
describe
in
a
minute,
puts
in
question
and
uncertainty
all
of
the
190-mile
boundary
and
really
impedes
development
of
the
riverfront.
but
we
are
here
because
of
the
compact
and
what
we
agreed
to.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
yes,
we
thought
about
that.
i've
never
seen
any
cases,
where
state
was
successful
in
rescinding
a
compact
approved
by
congress
and
if
that
happened
we
would
have
a
far
greater
mess
than
we
have
got
now.
and,
i
don't
know
where
we'd
end
up
and
we
didn't
think
that
as
a
state,
we
can
ask
for
rescission.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
it
must
be
your
honor,
in
the
form
of
injunctive
relief.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
yes,
sir.
your
honor,
we
feel
it's
only
enforceable
in
this
court
because
it's
an
original
action
between
the
two
states.
and
we
don't
think
iowa
can
make
her
own
determination,
as
to
what
her
commitment
is.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
oh!
yes
sir,
it's
not
based
on
his
citizenship.
it
is
based
upon
what
iowa
agreed
to
and
what
she
agreed
to
recognize.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
yes,
sir.
they
definitely
could
be
a
third
party
beneficiary.
we
do
think
that
the
facts
in
the
case
are
pretty
clearly
shown
though
that
he
cannot
effectively
defend
himself
or
protect
himself,
because
this
river
moved
across
three
or
four
miles.
he
didn't
have
a
chain
of
title,
like
i
have
in
my
house,
where
i
have
had
one
piece
of
property
for
60
years.
it
could
have
been
accretion
at
one
time
to
this
section,
or
this
section,
or
this
section,
or
the
section,
as
the
river
moved
over.
as
it
went
back,
they
could
re-establish
the
sections,
they
could
call
accretion
of
this
section,
and
the
river
could
be
drawn
over
here,
it
could
have
be
three
or
four
sections
described
as
accretion
to
this
one.
or
they
could
be
placed
on
his
tax
lawsuits.
it's
a
tremendously
complicated
process.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
he
can
raise
it.
yes,
your
honor.
the
problem
is
that
they
have
not
effectively
been
able
to
raise
it
in
the
past.
there's
an
iowa
decision,
which
said
for
instance
in
dartmouth
college
case,
the
compact
had
no
effect
upon
private
titles.
but
we
think
we
can
show
it
did
have
an
effect
upon
private
titles.
in
1961,
iowa
came
out
with
a
missouri
river
planning
report
and
i
believe
the
master
forward
copies
to
this
court,
which
was
a
first
document
where
they
publicly
announced
a
policy
of
claiming
lands
on
the
river.
and
there
is
an
evidence
how
they
selected
these
areas.
they
made
no
investigation
of
any
nebraska
titles.
they
didn't
talk
to
the
landowners.
they
assumed
anybody
in
possession
was
a
trespasser.
if
somebody
raised
the
nebraska
title,
they
automatically
called
it
a
spurious
and
fictitious
title.
and
all
of
a
sudden,
all
these
farmers,
who
have
these
lands
since
1963
or
farming
it
found
they
were
under
attack
by
the
state
of
iowa.
they
couldn't
borrow
on
their
land,
which
in
partly
the
operation
tremendously
difficult
and
they
couldn't
understand
the
situation
they've
been
placed
in.
now,
going
back
to
the
compact,
which
was
a
compromise.
first,
it
was
an
agreement
between
the
two
states
and
iowa
bound
herself
in
this
compact.
the
first
section,
established
the
boundary
and
it
established
it
in
the
middle
of
this
main
channel,
as
it
appear
on
the
corps
of
engineer
maps.
this
made
the
boundary
a
fixed
line.
it
changed
the
boundary
between
the
states
from
a
movable
boundary,
in
every
case
to
a
fix
line
on
the
geographic
center.
now,
in
most
instances,
that
navigable
channel,
where
the
river
was
still
the
boundary
had
followed
the
outside
of
the
bends
and
it
cross
back
and
forth
as
it
flowed
down
the
river.
so
that
what
compact
did
was
change
the
location
of
that
boundary,
and
it
changed
it
to
a
fix
line,
so
it
changed
the
state's
right.
one
of
the
issues
is
did
this
change
the
private
riparian
owner's
right.
and
we
don't
think
that
by
changing
our
state
line,
we
change
the
line
of
the
private
owners,
because
we
think
that
their
lines
should
have
stayed
the
same.
we
didn't
take
away
their
right,
which
was
a
vested
property
right.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
pardon
me?
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
absolutely,
but
there's
been
no
provision
for
compensation
under
anything
while
it's
done.
she's
done
it
supposedly
under
her
common
law
and
this
is
the
basis
for
planning
report,
that
in
iowa,
the
common
law
provides
that
the
state
own
the
beds
of
navigable
rivers.
in
nebraska,
the
principle
is
always
been
that
the
state
has
a
public
easement
for
navigation,
but
riparian
owner
owns
it
and
this
includes
accretion
to
the
bed
of
that
river.
but,
section
1
changed
the
situation
all
along
the
boundaries.
so,
land
in
its
very
strict
technical
sense
was
transferred
back
and
forth,
all
along
that
river.
then,
in
section
2
of
course
they
recognize
the
lands
on
each
side
were
ceded
and
they
really
operated
language
in
sections
3
and
4.
in
section
3,
they
said
basically
titles,
mortgages,
and
other
liens
good
in
nebraska,
shall
be
good
in
iowa,
as
to
lands
nebraska
shall
cede
to
iowa
any
pending
suits
could
be
prosecuted
final
judgment.
iowa
says,
oh
yes,
you've
got
to
prove
it
was
good
in
nebraska,
before
we
have
to
recognize
the
title.
our
contention
is
iowa,
you
agreed
in
the
context,
where
you
were
making
no
claims.
you
agreed
in
a
context,
where
you
recognized
the
uncertain
situations.
you
agreed
in
a
context,
where
you
didn't
want
to
find
the
boundary,
you
wanted
to
avoid
it.
in
a
compact
should
be
construed
as
the
master
read
it,
to
cover
all
lands
in
the
situation,
which
existed
along
the
river
in
1943,
because
that's
what
they
were
referring
to.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
it
says,
as
to
lands
shall
be
good
in
iowa,
as
to
any
lands
in
nebraska
may
cede
to
iowa,
as
to
any
lands
nebraska
--
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
yes
sir,
without
the
necessity
of
determining
where
the
boundary
actually
was.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
right
your
honor,
because
everybody
recognize
the
confused
situation
and
the
difficulty
of
determining
where
the
actual
boundary
was.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
yes
sir,
your
honor.
recognizing
again,
that
that
proper
chain
of
title
may
consist
of
some
possessory
rights
or
a
very
difficult,
what
some
people
may
call
it
paper
title,
that
because
you
don't
have
a
paper
title.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
so,
we
don't
feel
that
iowa
can
conduct
herself,
because
she
agreed
that
they're
good.
but
then
she
come
and
attacked
them
and
we
say
this
is
binding
on
her
courts,
on
her
legislative
and
executive
branches.
so
she
can't
say
we
are
going
to
go
and
determine
our
courts,
because
our
courts
are
also
bound
by
what
are
commitment
was.
that
is
one
basic
proposition.
now,
there
was
also
--
you
see
section
3,
we
feel
was
language
of
recognition
of
a
situation
in
private
titles,
then
the
states
added
section
4,
which
said
that
taxes
for
the
current
year
can
be
levied
on
lands
ceded
to
the
other
state
and
for
one
year.
and
that
any
rights
under
those
taxes,
accrued
or
accruing
would
be
asserted
in
five
years
or
be
forever
barred
in
the
states
would
stop
taxing
across
the
river.
so,
4,
we
feel
was
a
limitation
on
what
the
states
can
do,
3
was
a
recognition
of
private
rights
and
the
states
look
that
this
and
said
now
we
solved
their
problem,
we
have
no
more
problems,
we're
through.
and
we
think
that
this
compact
has
to
be
construed
liberally
to
effectuate
the
intention
for
which
it
was
adopted
and
that
was
to
settle
all
the
problems.
we
agree
with
the
master's
finding
that
in
any
action
by
landowner
or
by
iowa
along
the
river
that
the
landowner
should
not
have
to
prove
where
the
boundary
was
beforehand.
if
he
raises
some
nebraska
title,
iowa
should
have
to
recognize
it.
the
evidence
is
clear
that
iowa
didn't
even
inquire.
and,
when
the
titles
were
raised,
she
has
said
they're
spurious
and
fictitious.
we
go
a
little
further
and
contend
that
iowa
shouldn't
be
able
to
raise
all
these
problems
that
we
ought
to
be
placed
in
a
situation
we
were
in
1943
and
for
at
least
15
years
or
after,
before
iowa
starting
asserting
these
claims.
and
if
that
means
that
iowa
has
to
recognize
the
nebraska
owners
title
to
the
bed,
and
iowa
has
easement
for
public
navigation,
as
nebraska
has
or
it's
all
the
public
has,
she
hasn't
been
deprived
with
anything.
there
were
areas,
where
the
river
was
entirely
in
nebraska,
at
the
time
of
the
compact.
and
in
those
areas,
many
of
which
the
states
did
not
want
to
determine.
our
contention
is
that
the
entire
bed
was
in
nebraska.
and
when
iowa
said
titles
good
nebraska,
shall
be
good
in
iowa.
she
is
recognizing
the
title
to
the
bed,
she
didn't
accept
it.
iowa
position
now
is
we
own
the
entire
bed
because
it's
in
iowa.
another
issue,
which
has
come
up
was
originally
decided
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit,
i
think
it
was
in
november
of
1960,
in
which
another
situation,
where
there's
no
question
about
the
facts
occurred.
the
river
was
in
the
design
channel,
it
moved
out
into
iowa,
land
build
up
behind
it,
and
the
corps
of
engineers
placed
it
back
in
the
design
channel.
this
case
involved
between
$12,000.00
and
$13,000.00
of
damages
condemnation
by
the
corps
of
engineers
for
placing
the
river
back
into
the
design
channel
or
the
boundary.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eight
circuit
said
the
land
is
in
iowa.
iowa
owns
the
bed.
therefore,
iowa
owns
it
and
the
nebraska
riparian
owner
was
deprived
of
his
ownership.
iowa
has
used
that
principle
in
order
to
make
her
claims
to
all
lands,
north
of
omaha.
and
our
position
is
this,
that
when
we
intended
to
settle
this
thing,
we
didn't
change
the
private
property
owner's
boundary,
it
should
have
stayed
the
same,
because
we
couldn't
divest
them
of
their
property
rights
without
due
process
of
law
and
without
compensation.
had
it
not
been
for
the
compact,
when
that
river
moved
into
iowa,
the
nebraska
riparian
owners'
rights,
which
extended
to
the
thalweg
or
thread
of
the
stream
moved
with
it,
because
that's
a
private
property
boundary
matter.
and
it
moved
over
and
when
the
court
put
it
back
without
washing
away
the
intervening
islands,
it
was
an
avulsion,
which
left
that
private
property
boundary
remaining
over
into
iowa
and
the
nebraska
riparian
owner
should
have
had
preserve
to
him
his
right
to
his
accretions.
if
it
is
read
otherwise,
then
we
say
that
nebraska
riparian
owner
has
been
deprived
of
his
property
without
due
process
of
law.
it's
very
easy
to
say,
the
lands
in
iowa,
therefore
iowa
applies,
and
therefore
iowa
owns
it.
but
the
fact
is
what
did
the
parties
agreed
to
and
we
say
iowa
law
is
what
the
compact
provides.
requiring
iowa
to
recognize
private
rights
and
we
say
that
you
have
to
look
and
cede.
you'd
have
to
say
in
the
tyson
case,
but
for
the
compact,
the
boundary
would
have
been
clear
over
into
iowa.
the
states
avoided
the
necessity
of
worrying
about
that
as
between
themselves
but
they
shouldn't
be
able
to
deprive
the
riparian
owner
of
his
rights,
because
of
that,
of
their
agreement.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
no
sir,
your
honor.
we
are
here
because
we
didn't
just
agree
to
a
new
boundary.
if
we
had
section
1
and
said
here's
the
boundary
and
stopped,
it
might
be
a
different
situation,
but
we
said
no,
we
have
3
and
4
here,
where
iowa
have
to
engage
in
certain
conduct
to
assure
us
that
we're
getting
what
we
bargained
for
and
we
agreed
to
the
same
thing
for
you.
iowa
has
to
rely
on
section
1
to
show
the
lands
in
iowa,
that's
the
only
way
she
can
do
it.
and
she
does
rely
in
section,
so
she's
relying
in
part
upon
that
compact
to
establish
jurisdiction.
then,
she
says,
jurisdiction
establishes
our
title,
because
we're
in
iowa
and
we
own
the
bed.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
well,
the
jurisdiction
is
because
we
entered
into
the
compact,
pursuant
to
authority
of
the
constitution.
and
this
is
action
regarding
that
compact
and
when
the
states
came
into
the
union,
they
gave
up
their
right
to
solve
their
problems
in
the
other
way.
and,
when
we
do
it
by
compact,
this
is
the
proper
place
to
tell
us
what
that
compact
means
and
what
conduct
is
proper
pursuant
to
it.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
i
think
essentially
as
between
the
states,
yes.
because
i
think
if
they
can't,
we're
involved
into
specific
one,
but
if
they
can't,
there
no
place
else
where
they
can
go
to
solve
their
problems.
and,
if
they
can't
enforce
their
problems
somewhere,
there's
no
incentive
to
enter
into
compacts
at
all.
and
this
court
has
often
suggested
courts
try
to
settle
their
problems,
by
entering
into
a
compact.
this
is
what
we
did,
we
think
it
settled
our
problems,
we
think
that
the
court
should
tell
the
state
of
iowa
and
everyone
that
this
is
how
it
settled
it
and
this
is
what
you
can
do
pursuant
to
it.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
oh
no!
it
rests
on
the
fact
that
the
parties
are
two
sovereign
states
and
they
entered
into
agreement
pursuant
to
the
constitution
--
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
essentially
correct
your
honor,
but
it
has
to
be
a
controversy.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
that's
correct.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
that's
correct,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
your
honor,
that
may
be
that
the
nominal
title
may
be
the
distinction.
in
this
case
it
involved
our
boundary
which
has
also
been
a
matter
of
state
interest
and
when
the
nations
were
or
states
were
admitted
in
the
union,
controversy
as
to
boundary
and
agreements
as
to
boundary
were
in
existence
in
traditional
and
historical.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
no,
because
we
agreed
to
where
it
was,
but
we
didn't
just
say
--
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
that's
right,
if
we
can't
get
what
we
bargained
for,
although
nebraska
would
never
--
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
well,
i
know
nebraska
would
never
bear
arms.
i
don't
about
the
farmers
here.[laughter
attempt]
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
there's
a
real
question
of
where
it
is,
because
the
documents
they
used
in
defining
it
that
were
so
general
that
they
didn't
have
a
sufficient
data
to
allow
a
surveyor
laid
on
the
ground.
that
is
not
why
we're
here.
that's
another
aid
in
construction
your
honor
that
they
used
a
very
general
agreement
to
generally
settle,
because
they
didn't
lay
it
on
the
ground.
they
use
maps
that
are,
like
road
maps,
almost.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
we
argued
everything
your
honor,
because
--
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
yes
sir
and
we
had
a
two-hour
argument
and
we
--
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
1965
and
we
went
through
the
whole
thing
--
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
and
you
granted
[voice
overlap]
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
in
fact
your
honor
at
that
time
i
made
the
comment,
and
i'll
never
forget
it
that
this
is
mr.
justice
brennan
said,
"isn't
true
that
this
is
an
action
to
enforce
a
compact?"
i
said,
"yes
your
honor,
maybe
you
ought
to
say
that
and
sit
down."
and
he
looked
at
me
and
said,
"maybe
you
ought
it."
but,
we
had
to
give
you
the
full
picture,
because
we
did
not
want
them
mislead
this
court.
and
i
don't
think
we
did
mislead
them,
we
feel
that
it
is
necessary
to
settle
this,
because
there
are
approximately
47
miles
at
the
present
time,
where
the
river
is
not
located
in
the
boundary.
it's
moved
out
north
of
omaha
and
unless
we
find
out
what
we
agreed
to
in
1943,
it's
almost
going
to
prevent
at
another
agreement,
which
is
necessary.
and
the
present
situation
we
feel
impedes
the
development
of
lands
along
the
missouri
river
and
it
really
results
in
the
government
of
men
and
not
of
laws
along
the
missouri
river.
your
honor,
i
wish
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
may
it
please
the
court.
one
thing
that
we
think
it's
important
to
analyze
is
a
fact,
which
iowa
apparently
is
overlooked
and
that
is
that
when
they
entered
into
compact,
they
changed
the
laws
along
the
river
to
a
fix
boundary.
now,
all
the
five
previous
riparian
laws
were
based
upon
the
fact
that
when
a
person
is
subject
to
having
his
property
taken
away
by
moving
one
of
the
river,
he
is
subject
to
having
it
added
to,
as
the
river
goes
the
other
way.
and
that
is
the
rationale
for
all
of
those
arguments,
there
isn't
going
to
be
any
decision,
which
said
you
can
accrete
across
the
state
line,
usually
where
you
have
a
movable
boundary,
because
a
movable
boundary
is
the
same
for
the
state
as
it
is
for
the
private
riparian
owners.
but
now
we've
changed
the
situation,
we
entered
into
a
compact
with
a
fix
line
and
i
think
that
requires
an
analysis
then
of,
is
the
rationale
still
there?
iowa
cites
all
these
early
common
law
cases
and
said
this
has
always
been
the
common
law
and
we
don't
dispute
that.
and
in
those
situations
there
were
presumptions,
we
can't
dispute
that,
but
we
can't
say
we
sat
down
in
1943
and
superimposed
the
new
situation
by
contract.
and
this
changed
everything
required
by
examination.
iowa
likes
to
use
the
presumption
that
the
river
moved
gradually
into
its
location
and
would
argue
from
that,
that
therefore
in
1943
the
river
was
the
boundary.
but
the
master's
findings
negate
that
fact
and
the
facts
and
all
the
mass
of
evidence
in
this
case
negates
that
fact.
and
if
the
presumption
was
that
there
was
a
boundary,
we
didn't
need
a
boundary
compact.
we
recognize
it
wasn't
the
boundary
and
the
master
so
specifically
found.
iowa
utilized
the
presumptions
in
this
manner
and
she
did
so
in
the
schemmel
case,
which
started
trial
in
1964.
and
then
trial
has
been
postponed
until
the
decision
in
this
case.
but
she
offered
evidence
with
two
witnesses
in
the
schemmel
case
and
rested.
and
then
i
think
we've
quoted
it
in
the
briefs
somewhere,
counsel
stated
originally
that,
initially,
they
are
going
to
rely
on
the
presumption
of
gradual
movement
of
the
river
into
its
present
location.
so
anything
on
the
eastern
or
left
bank
side
would
be
in
iowa.
at
the
same
time,
in
interrogatories
in
this
case,
iowa
admitted
that
she
knew
that
a
canal
was
dug
in
nebraska
in
1938,
in
that
location
and
yet
she's
relying
on
the
presumptions.
and
the
evidence
in
this
case,
in
the
schemmel
case
shows
a
canal
a
mile
long
placing
the
river
in
the
designed
channel,
along
with
other
movements
by
dikes
and
revetments
in
the
schemmel
area,
but
iowa,
by
being
able
to
utilize
the
presumption
puts
a
tremendous
burden
on
the
landowner
of
coming
back
in
and
having
to
establish
how
the
river
got
there
in
the
past.
this
means
old
documents,
old
witnesses,
evidence
is
gone,
it
has
been
lost
and
destroyed
and
the
corps
of
engineers
itself
was
not
a
record-keeping
body.
and
many
of
its
records
were
thrown
away.
so
it
puts
the
landowner
if
he
got
to
rebut
that
presumption
in
an
extremely
difficult
position
and
extremely
expensive
position.
a
tremendous
amount
of
time
and
effort
has
been
spent
in
getting
evidence
in
this
case;
very
few
farmers
could
afford
that
type
of
litigation
or
defense
of
that
type
of
litigation.
we
say
when
iowa
said
in
compact
that
titles
will
be
good.
again,
we
have
to
determine
which
ones,
but
when
she
says
they're
good,
that
doesn't
mean
that
we
said
we're
going
to
put
you
now
landowner
over
at
iowa,
although
she
admits
they're
good
she
can
attack
your
title
at
any
time
and
put
that
tremendous
burden
upon
you
to
rebut
all
the
presumptions
and
come
in
establish
that
you've
got
a
good
title.
we
don't
think
that
we
send
our
citizens
over
there
to
give
them
a
forum,
which
changes
the
jurisdiction,
and
from
the
change
in
jurisdiction,
a
change
of
ownership
followed.
when
iowa
said
titles
good
in
nebraska,
will
be
good
in
iowa,
we
say
it
had
to
apply
to
the
bed
also
in
both
sides
because
there
were
many
places
where
both
sides
of
that
bed
were
in
nebraska.
she
didn't
say
we're
going
to
accept
that
title
and
take
the
title
of
the
bed.
so,
by
saying
iowa
law
applies,
iowa
law
is
i
owns
the
bed;
it's
negating
completely
iowa's
agreement
that
the
title
to
that
part,
good
in
nebraska
would
be
good
in
iowa.
let
me
conclude
them
by
saying
that
nebraska
is
here
as
contracting
party
with
a
right
to
enforce
the
compact.
iowa
apparently
only
wants
to
enforce
section
1
of
the
compact,
but
we
say
that
if
only
section
1
is
valid,
then
we
have
lost
the
complete
consideration
for
the
remainder
of
our
bargain.
we
feel
that
the
compact
should
be
read
in
the
manner
in
which
it
was
intended
in
1943
and
were
that
great
object
can
be
seen,
it
should
be
effectuated
and
that
was
to
settle
and
later
rest
in
all
of
these
problems,
which
existed
along
the
missouri
river.
thank
you.
