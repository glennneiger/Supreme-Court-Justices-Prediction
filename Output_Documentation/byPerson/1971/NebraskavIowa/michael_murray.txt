mr.
michael
murray
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
want
to
rearrange
the
order
of
my
remarks
a
bit
due
to
the
line
of
questions,
which
the
questions
which
the
court
has
just
been
asking
mr.
moldenhauer.
it
is
iowa's
position
that
this
is
not
a
proper
case
for
this
court
to
exercise
its
original
jurisdiction.
mr.
michael
murray
it's
our
understanding,
your
honor
that
whether
or
not
a
permission
is
given
to
file
a
complaint
is
dealt
with
usually
in
a
sort
of
a
pro
forma
manner
and
that
if
there
is
any
reason
why
the
complaints
should
be
permitted
to
be
filed,
this
court
will
permit
it.
but
that
it
still
remains
for
the
complainant
to
prove
his
case.
and
we
feel
that
this
court
as
any
other
court
should
examine
its
jurisdiction
at
all
stages.
mr.
michael
murray
well,
we
still
feel,
may
it
please
the
court
that
nebraska
had
the
burden
of
proving
facts,
whereby
she
was
entitled
to
an
exercise
of
the
court's
original
jurisdiction.
and,
we
feel
that
now
she
has
had
her
opportunity
to
prove
those
facts
and
we
feel
that
she
failed.
mr.
michael
murray
[laughter
attempt]
there
are
three
basic
things
that
we
feel
nebraska
failed
to
prove
was
that
iowa
violated
the
compact.
basically,
we
feel
that
she
failed
to
prove
that,
because
the
proof
is,
that
what
we
have
done
is
engage
in
litigation
in
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
concerning
the
ownership
of
several
of
these
areas.
we
didn't
send
out
the
national
guard
or
the
corp
of
game
wardens,
or
the
highway
patrol
to
move
these
people
off
these
islands
or
off
these
abandoned
channels.
all
we
did
was
engage
his
litigation
in
this
litigation,
sometimes
as
plaintiff,
sometimes
as
a
defendant,
sometimes
as
an
intervenor.
in
the
iowa
courts,
of
course,
because
these
areas,
which
the
state
claims
to
own
are
all
in
iowa
and
we
simply
don't
feel
that,
that
was
violation
of
the
compact.
secondly,
we
feel
that
they
haven't
proved
that
judicial
controversy
between
these
two
states.
they
fail
to
prove
that
because
nebraska
has
no
real
and
present
interest
in
this
matter.
some
of
our
citizens
do,
some
citizens
of
iowa
do.
some
non-residents
of
both
states
do,
but
nebraska
has
no
interest.
she
doesn't
claim
to
own
any
of
these
areas,
which
iowa
now
claims
to
own.
that
was
established
by
interrogatories
and
answers
into
interrogatories.
early
in
the
pretrial
phases
of
the
case.
it
is
for
these
reasons
for
the
reason
that
she
failed
in
her
proof
that
we
feel
that
this
court
should
not
exercise
its
powers
of
original
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
murray
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
murray
yes.
mr.
michael
murray
that's
right.
mr.
michael
murray
that's
right.
and,
i
can't
cite
you
to
a
case
for
it.
as
far
as
i
know,
this
is
the
first
case
mr.
moldenhauer
said
it's
a
peculiar
case.
this
is
the
first
case
that
ever
came
before
the
court,
where
this
sort
of
a
situation
exist.
and
i
don't
believe,
as
far
as
i
know
at
least,
there
isn't
any
prior
case
on
the
point.
it's
perfectly
true
that
the
state
of
iowa
does
assert
in
this
case,
and
in
these
cases
in
state
court,
where
we
think
the
issues
should
be
decided,
that
we
do
own
the
bed
of
the
missouri
river,
in
so
far
as
that
bed
is
in
iowa.
and
we
do
assert
that
we
own
certain
islands,
not
all
islands,
but
certain
islands,
which
have
formed
over
that
bed.
specifically,
the
islands
which
have
formed
in
iowa
over
that
bed.
if
they've
formed
in
nebraska,
we
agreed
that
we
do
not
own
them.
also,
we
claim
to
own
certain
abandoned
channels
of
the
river
in
iowa,
but
not
all
of
them.
and
the
reason
for
this
is
that
it
is
the
law
of
iowa
that
the
state
doesn't
remain
the
owner
of
all
abandoned
channels.
i
think
a
fair
statement
of
the
law
of
iowa
is
that
we
only
own
abandoned
channels,
which
are
abandoned
by
an
avulsion.
and
wherever
an
abandon
channel
was
abandoned
by
the
process
of
accretion,
by
the
process
of
land
forming
to
the
shore
from
a
private
riparian
owner,
then
the
private
riparian
owner
owns
that
land,
as
accretion
to
his
riparian
shore.
the
iowa
rules,
i
think
our
best
summarized
in
the
case
of
holman
versus
hodges
in
1901,
by
the
iowa
supreme
court
justice
ladd,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
and
the
reasons
for
them
are
fully
discussed
in
that
opinion.
this
has
been
the
law
of
iowa,
consistently
since
1856,
ten
years
after
we
were
admitted
to
statehood.
the
court
in
iowa
has
never
deviated
and
there
are
a
number
of
cases
at
least
since
1943,
where
the
iowa
court
has
said
that
this
is
still
the
law
of
iowa.
iowa
owns
the
bed,
iowa
owns
accretions
to
the
bed,
iowa
owns
abandoned
channels,
which
were
abandoned
by
avulsion.
now
nebraska
claims
in
this
case
that
we
signed
a
way
our
right
to
claim
ownership
of
anything
along
the
missouri
river,
by
operation
of
that
common
law,
when
we
entered
into
the
1943
boundary
compact.
this
is
the
equivalent
of
saying
that
the
1943
boundary
compact
repealed
the
law,
repealed
the
common
law
of
iowa,
in
so
far
as
it
would
apply
to
the
missouri
river.
we
deny
that,
that
happened
as
a
result
of
the
compact.
and
the
first
reason
i
would
mention
for
our
denial
is
that
the
compact
simply
doesn't
say
that.
and
it
doesn't
say
anything
like
that
and
in
a
sense
it
said
just
the
opposite
of
that.
when
nebraska
proposes
that
the
compact
repealed
the
iowa
common
law
along
the
river,
she
recognizes
her
responsibility
to
oppose
something
to
fill
the
void,
which
would
then
be
left.
she
proposes
then
that
nebraska
common
law
should
take
over
and
apply
on
both
sides
of
the
river.
now
that's
diametrically
opposed
to
what
the
compact
said,
because
section
2
says
that
the
state
of
nebraska,
hereby
siege
to
the
state
of
iowa
and
relinquish
its
jurisdiction
over
all
lands
not
only
in
nebraska,
but
lying
easterly
of
said
boundary.
and
there
was
a
reciprocal
session
in
the
iowa
enactment
of
the
compact.
by
this
language
we
think
nebraska
said
to
iowa,
nevermore
will
our
sovereignty
or
our
jurisdiction,
or
our
land
title
laws
extend
east
of
the
boundary
and
into
iowa.
contrary
to
what
nebraska
--
mr.
michael
murray
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
murray
we
don't
really
agree
that
it
was
owned
by
the
nebraska
riparian
owner.
we
deny
that
the
nebraska
riparian
owner
had
any
vested
title
to
it
under
nebraska
law?
mr.
michael
murray
prior
to
the
compact.
mr.
michael
murray
oh!
no.
mr.
michael
murray
no.
what
i'm
saying
is
as
far
as
we
were
concerned
at
least,
it
was
a
property
of
the
nebraska
owner,
but
what
i'm
saying
is
that
he
had
no
vested
title
to
it.
actually
--
mr.
michael
murray
i
didn't
quite
understand
that
question.
mr.
michael
murray
nebraska
made
her
election
to
become
one
of
those
states,
wherein
the
beds
of
her
navigable
rivers
are
privately
owned.
in
the
1906
case
of
kinkead
versus
turgeon
does
say
that
nebraska
riparian
owner
owns
to
the
thread
of
the
stream.
the
only
trouble
with
kinkead
is
that
it
didn't
involve
ownership
of
any
bed
of
any
navigable
river.
kinkead
involved
accretions,
which
had
arisen
and
were
inexistence
at
the
time
of
the
case.
therefore,
we
say
that
when
the
nebraska
court
said
in
nebraska
our
landowners
shall
own
the
thread
of
the
stream
that
that
was
dictum,
because
the
case
didn't
involve
ownership
of
the
bed
of
the
stream.
mr.
michael
murray
that's
right.
now,
we
think
that
--
let
me
say
one
more
thing,
first
of
all
we
have
cited
all
the
nebraska
cases
in
our
exceptions
to
the
special
master's
report,
which
could
possibly
be
construed
as
creating
a
vested
right
in
the
landowner
to
the
bed
of
the
stream.
and
there
is
no
case
in
nebraska,
which
involves
the
bed
of
a
navigable
stream.
every
case
in
which
any
remark
has
been
made
about
this
is
our
law,
private
ownership
to
the
thread
has
involved
either
accretions
in
being
or
it
has
involved
the
platte
river,
which
is
a
non-navigable
stream.
so,
we
say
that
all
the
statements
that
nebraska
court
has
ever
made
about
it
are
in
the
nature
of
dicta.
and,
we
agree
that
dicta,
perhaps
creates
the
law
of
nebraska,
but
it
doesn't
create
vested
rights,
which
the
nebraska
unicameral
couldn't
change
and
it's
our
position
in
this
case
that
when
the
nebraska
unicameral
ceded
to
iowa
everything
east
of
the
new
boundary
then
it
was
she
it
was
the
unicameral
that
was
changing
the
law
that
would
be
equitable
to
those
areas.
and,
they
were
saying
hereafter,
the
law
of
iowa
shall
apply
to
them.
nebraska
said
that
the
unicameral
couldn't
do
that,
because
these
landowners
had
vested
rights
in
the
bed
of
the
river.
we
say
no,
they
had
no
vested
rights,
and
therefore,
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
could
have
changed
their
common
law
concerning
ownership
of
their
riverbeds
they
never
have,
but
they
could
have.
and
legislature
possessed
the
power
to
change
the
nebraska
law
and
in
so
far
as
it's
applicable
to
lands
east
of
the
boundary,
that's
precisely
what
the
unicameral
did.
the
special
master
agreed
with
us
on
this
proposition
and
at
page
193
of
his
report,
he
sets
out
his
proposed
rule
for
determining
ownership
of
lands,
which
have
formed
since
the
compact,
since
1943.
and
by
the
way
to
give
you
some
idea
of
what's
involved
here;
iowa
now
claims
to
own
approximately
30
areas,
up
and
down
the
river,
between
sioux
city
and
the
missouri
state
line.
approximately,
eight
of
these
areas
were
in
existence
at
the
time
the
compact
was
entered
into.
and
the
remaining
22
areas
have
come
into
existence,
since
the
compact.
mr.
moldenhauer
mentioned
that
one
case
has
gone
as
far
as
the
eight
circuit
concerning
the
ownership
of
one
of
these
tracks
of
land.
a
track
of
land
which
is
now
involved
here
and
included
in
the
30
areas,
which
iowa
claims
to
own.
and
this
case
was
entitled
in
circuit
court,
tyson
versus
iowa,
decided
in
1960.
mr.
moldenhauer
has
very
roughly,
but
correctly
related
the
facts
of
tyson
after
1943,
the
river
escaped
from
the
designed
channel,
which
was
west
of
the
area,
the
area
being
in
iowa.
it
escaped
by
washing
away
its
left
bank
and
stabilizing
structures
and
ultimately
the
left
bank
moved
approximately
a
mile
and
a
half
into
iowa.
in
the
meantime,
the
right
bank
or
nebraska
bank
remained
stationary.
when
the
river
acquired
a
width
of
a
mile
and
a
half,
of
course
it
became
shallow
and
an
island
arose
on
the
iowa
side
of
the
boundary
but
west
of
the
thalweg
of
the
river.
in
other
words,
on
the
nebraska
side
of
the
thalweg,
but
on
the
iowa
side
of
the
boundary.
both
the
district
court,
judge
hickland
(ph)
and
the
circuit
court
held
that
the
island
belong
to
iowa
because
it
had
arisen
over
and
has
an
accretion
to
the
state
own
bed
of
the
river.
now,
nebraska
recognizes
in
this
case
that
if
they
are
to
have
their
construction
of
the
compact,
and
if
they
are
going
to
have
their
way,
the
tyson
decision
must
be
overruled
or
at
least
disavowed.
the
special
master
considered
that
proposition
very
carefully
and
concluded
that
the
tyson
case
was
right.
the
law
of
the
tyson
case
is
valid
and
that
it
should
not
be
overruled
and
disavowed,
it's
about
that
simple.
and
the
law
which
comes
out
of
the
tyson
case,
as
far
as
we're
concerned
is
about
this,
that
tyson's
right
to
accrete
by
nebraska
law
was
limited
to
the
state
boundary.
and
he
could
not
before
the
compact
and
cannot
since
the
compact
accrete
by
nebraska
law
into
iowa.
secondly,
if
tyson
were
to
accrete
into
iowa,
he
could
only
do
so,
under
iowa
law.
now,
there
is
a
possibility
that
a
nebraska
landowner
could
accrete
into
iowa
under
iowa
law,
because
iowa
recognizes
that
the
private
riparian
owner
becomes
the
owner
of
accretions
which
formed
to
his
high
bank.
the
thing
that
iowa
law
denies
is
that
a
private
riparian
owner
of
either
state
can
accrete
under
the
water.
now,
nebraska
lets
the
man
accrete
under
the
water,
because
his
boundary,
by
nebraska
law
is
the
thalweg.
and
wherever
the
thalweg
goes,
there
goes
his
boundary,
but
not
by
iowa
law.
it
inheres
in
the
tyson
decision
that
the
common
law
of
iowa,
which
has
been
in
effect
since
1856
is
still
in
effect
in
inheres
in
tyson
that
it
wasn't
repealed
by
the
compact
and
it
inheres
in
the
decision
that
iowa
didn't
sign
a
way
her
rights
to
claim
ownership
of
lands,
river
beds,
and
so
forth
by
its
operation.
actually,
the
tyson
case
simply
follows
a
long
line
of
cases
by
this
court
of
which
arkansas
versus
tennessee
is
an
example.
there've
been
several
arkansas-tennessee
cases
and
the
one
i
refer
to
is
246
u.s.
158.
the
special
master
quotes
from
that
decision
at
page
188
of
his
report.
so,
the
law
that
came
out
of
tyson
isn't
anything
new.
it's
the
same
law
that
this
court
has
been
applying
for
years.
also,
i
might
mention
that
in
order
for
nebraska
to
have
her
way
about
this
case,
the
case
of
state
of
iowa
versus
raymond
by
the
iowa
supreme
court
in
1963
would
have
to
be
overruled
and
disavowed.
mr.
michael
murray
no,
but
it
inheres
in
the
case
that
the
iowa
common
law
is
the
iowa
common
law.
mr.
michael
murray
no,
i
don't
so.
mr.
michael
murray
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
the
question,
your
honor,
but
i
--
mr.
michael
murray
oh!
sure
they
do.
i
am
sorry
if
i
--
mr.
michael
murray
yes.
mr.
michael
murray
no,
just
some
of
them.
now,
actually
--
mr.
michael
murray
tyson's
secondary
position,
i
would
say,
in
the
tyson
case
was
that
a
compact
didn't
affect
his
rights.
so,
in
a
manner
of
speaking
he
was
raising
a
compact,
but
it
was
in
a
negative
manner.
mr.
michael
murray
it's
available
to
everybody
that
has
an
interest
in
those
river
lands
and
the
ownership
of
them.
mr.
michael
murray
yes.
but
i've
got
beat,
because
tyson
never
did
have
any
rights
to
accrete
into
iowa
and
the
compact
doesn't
create
that
right
in
him
either.
mr.
michael
murray
yes.
mr.
michael
murray
and
that's
the
part
of
the
master's
report,
which
we
do
not
accept
to.
mr.
michael
murray
nebraska
accepts
to
that.
my
time
is
almost
up
and
i
haven't
gotten
even
to
our
exception,
which
is
to
the
special
master's
proposed
rule
for
determination
of
ownership
of
the
areas,
which
had
formed
prior
to
1943
and
which
were
in
existence
at
that
time.
we
feel
the
master
is
wrong
about
that
rule,
because
he
--
mr.
michael
murray
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
effect
of
the
special
master's
rule
for
pre
1943
areas
is
to
destroy
utterly
the
law
which
we've
always
known
as
the
law
of
boundaries
or
as
the
law
of
accretion.
and
he
supplants
another
law
in
place
of
it.
in
to
the
(inaudible)
under
the
special
master's
proposed
rule
for
the
pre
1943
areas
goes,
the
presumption
in
favor
of
accretion
and
against
avulsion.
under
the
special
master's
rule,
iowa
would
be
deprived
of
the
benefit
of
that
presumption,
which
this
court
recognizes
and
as
far
as
i
know,
every
court
that
ever
had
an
opportunity
recognizes.
he
destroys
the
presumption
in
favor
of
the
permanency
of
boundaries,
which
this
court
utilized
in
the
former
case
of
nebraska
versus
iowa
and
where
this
court
said
in
substance,
what
is
more
natural
when
people
are
dividing
lands
to
use
a
river
as
a
boundary.
mr.
michael
murray
practically
the
same,
the
result
is
the
same,
yes.
what
happens
under
the
special
master's
rule
to
the
proposition
that
a
state
suing
another
state
for
violation
of
anything
must
clear,
must
prove
her
case,
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
it's
gone.
and
what
happens
to
the
rule?
that
any
presumption
must
overcome
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
now,
the
special
master's
rule
simply
wipes
out
all
those
things,
which
we
have
thought
for
years,
where
the
law
of
accretion,
the
law
of
boundaries
and
puts
the
thing
entirely
on
one
basis
as
to
the
areas
prior
to
1943.
and
that
basis
is
was
very
title
in
nebraska
to
it
as
of
1943.
my
time
is
up.
i
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
michael
murray
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
want
to
rearrange
the
order
of
my
remarks
a
bit
due
to
the
line
of
questions,
which
the
questions
which
the
court
has
just
been
asking
mr.
moldenhauer.
it
is
iowa's
position
that
this
is
not
a
proper
case
for
this
court
to
exercise
its
original
jurisdiction.
mr.
michael
murray
it's
our
understanding,
your
honor
that
whether
or
not
a
permission
is
given
to
file
a
complaint
is
dealt
with
usually
in
a
sort
of
a
pro
forma
manner
and
that
if
there
is
any
reason
why
the
complaints
should
be
permitted
to
be
filed,
this
court
will
permit
it.
but
that
it
still
remains
for
the
complainant
to
prove
his
case.
and
we
feel
that
this
court
as
any
other
court
should
examine
its
jurisdiction
at
all
stages.
mr.
michael
murray
well,
we
still
feel,
may
it
please
the
court
that
nebraska
had
the
burden
of
proving
facts,
whereby
she
was
entitled
to
an
exercise
of
the
court's
original
jurisdiction.
and,
we
feel
that
now
she
has
had
her
opportunity
to
prove
those
facts
and
we
feel
that
she
failed.
mr.
michael
murray
[laughter
attempt]
there
are
three
basic
things
that
we
feel
nebraska
failed
to
prove
was
that
iowa
violated
the
compact.
basically,
we
feel
that
she
failed
to
prove
that,
because
the
proof
is,
that
what
we
have
done
is
engage
in
litigation
in
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
concerning
the
ownership
of
several
of
these
areas.
we
didn't
send
out
the
national
guard
or
the
corp
of
game
wardens,
or
the
highway
patrol
to
move
these
people
off
these
islands
or
off
these
abandoned
channels.
all
we
did
was
engage
his
litigation
in
this
litigation,
sometimes
as
plaintiff,
sometimes
as
a
defendant,
sometimes
as
an
intervenor.
in
the
iowa
courts,
of
course,
because
these
areas,
which
the
state
claims
to
own
are
all
in
iowa
and
we
simply
don't
feel
that,
that
was
violation
of
the
compact.
secondly,
we
feel
that
they
haven't
proved
that
judicial
controversy
between
these
two
states.
they
fail
to
prove
that
because
nebraska
has
no
real
and
present
interest
in
this
matter.
some
of
our
citizens
do,
some
citizens
of
iowa
do.
some
non-residents
of
both
states
do,
but
nebraska
has
no
interest.
she
doesn't
claim
to
own
any
of
these
areas,
which
iowa
now
claims
to
own.
that
was
established
by
interrogatories
and
answers
into
interrogatories.
early
in
the
pretrial
phases
of
the
case.
it
is
for
these
reasons
for
the
reason
that
she
failed
in
her
proof
that
we
feel
that
this
court
should
not
exercise
its
powers
of
original
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
murray
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
murray
yes.
mr.
michael
murray
that's
right.
mr.
michael
murray
that's
right.
and,
i
can't
cite
you
to
a
case
for
it.
as
far
as
i
know,
this
is
the
first
case
mr.
moldenhauer
said
it's
a
peculiar
case.
this
is
the
first
case
that
ever
came
before
the
court,
where
this
sort
of
a
situation
exist.
and
i
don't
believe,
as
far
as
i
know
at
least,
there
isn't
any
prior
case
on
the
point.
it's
perfectly
true
that
the
state
of
iowa
does
assert
in
this
case,
and
in
these
cases
in
state
court,
where
we
think
the
issues
should
be
decided,
that
we
do
own
the
bed
of
the
missouri
river,
in
so
far
as
that
bed
is
in
iowa.
and
we
do
assert
that
we
own
certain
islands,
not
all
islands,
but
certain
islands,
which
have
formed
over
that
bed.
specifically,
the
islands
which
have
formed
in
iowa
over
that
bed.
if
they've
formed
in
nebraska,
we
agreed
that
we
do
not
own
them.
also,
we
claim
to
own
certain
abandoned
channels
of
the
river
in
iowa,
but
not
all
of
them.
and
the
reason
for
this
is
that
it
is
the
law
of
iowa
that
the
state
doesn't
remain
the
owner
of
all
abandoned
channels.
i
think
a
fair
statement
of
the
law
of
iowa
is
that
we
only
own
abandoned
channels,
which
are
abandoned
by
an
avulsion.
and
wherever
an
abandon
channel
was
abandoned
by
the
process
of
accretion,
by
the
process
of
land
forming
to
the
shore
from
a
private
riparian
owner,
then
the
private
riparian
owner
owns
that
land,
as
accretion
to
his
riparian
shore.
the
iowa
rules,
i
think
our
best
summarized
in
the
case
of
holman
versus
hodges
in
1901,
by
the
iowa
supreme
court
justice
ladd,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
and
the
reasons
for
them
are
fully
discussed
in
that
opinion.
this
has
been
the
law
of
iowa,
consistently
since
1856,
ten
years
after
we
were
admitted
to
statehood.
the
court
in
iowa
has
never
deviated
and
there
are
a
number
of
cases
at
least
since
1943,
where
the
iowa
court
has
said
that
this
is
still
the
law
of
iowa.
iowa
owns
the
bed,
iowa
owns
accretions
to
the
bed,
iowa
owns
abandoned
channels,
which
were
abandoned
by
avulsion.
now
nebraska
claims
in
this
case
that
we
signed
a
way
our
right
to
claim
ownership
of
anything
along
the
missouri
river,
by
operation
of
that
common
law,
when
we
entered
into
the
1943
boundary
compact.
this
is
the
equivalent
of
saying
that
the
1943
boundary
compact
repealed
the
law,
repealed
the
common
law
of
iowa,
in
so
far
as
it
would
apply
to
the
missouri
river.
we
deny
that,
that
happened
as
a
result
of
the
compact.
and
the
first
reason
i
would
mention
for
our
denial
is
that
the
compact
simply
doesn't
say
that.
and
it
doesn't
say
anything
like
that
and
in
a
sense
it
said
just
the
opposite
of
that.
when
nebraska
proposes
that
the
compact
repealed
the
iowa
common
law
along
the
river,
she
recognizes
her
responsibility
to
oppose
something
to
fill
the
void,
which
would
then
be
left.
she
proposes
then
that
nebraska
common
law
should
take
over
and
apply
on
both
sides
of
the
river.
now
that's
diametrically
opposed
to
what
the
compact
said,
because
section
2
says
that
the
state
of
nebraska,
hereby
siege
to
the
state
of
iowa
and
relinquish
its
jurisdiction
over
all
lands
not
only
in
nebraska,
but
lying
easterly
of
said
boundary.
and
there
was
a
reciprocal
session
in
the
iowa
enactment
of
the
compact.
by
this
language
we
think
nebraska
said
to
iowa,
nevermore
will
our
sovereignty
or
our
jurisdiction,
or
our
land
title
laws
extend
east
of
the
boundary
and
into
iowa.
contrary
to
what
nebraska
--
mr.
michael
murray
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
murray
we
don't
really
agree
that
it
was
owned
by
the
nebraska
riparian
owner.
we
deny
that
the
nebraska
riparian
owner
had
any
vested
title
to
it
under
nebraska
law?
mr.
michael
murray
prior
to
the
compact.
mr.
michael
murray
oh!
no.
mr.
michael
murray
no.
what
i'm
saying
is
as
far
as
we
were
concerned
at
least,
it
was
a
property
of
the
nebraska
owner,
but
what
i'm
saying
is
that
he
had
no
vested
title
to
it.
actually
--
mr.
michael
murray
i
didn't
quite
understand
that
question.
mr.
michael
murray
nebraska
made
her
election
to
become
one
of
those
states,
wherein
the
beds
of
her
navigable
rivers
are
privately
owned.
in
the
1906
case
of
kinkead
versus
turgeon
does
say
that
nebraska
riparian
owner
owns
to
the
thread
of
the
stream.
the
only
trouble
with
kinkead
is
that
it
didn't
involve
ownership
of
any
bed
of
any
navigable
river.
kinkead
involved
accretions,
which
had
arisen
and
were
inexistence
at
the
time
of
the
case.
therefore,
we
say
that
when
the
nebraska
court
said
in
nebraska
our
landowners
shall
own
the
thread
of
the
stream
that
that
was
dictum,
because
the
case
didn't
involve
ownership
of
the
bed
of
the
stream.
mr.
michael
murray
that's
right.
now,
we
think
that
--
let
me
say
one
more
thing,
first
of
all
we
have
cited
all
the
nebraska
cases
in
our
exceptions
to
the
special
master's
report,
which
could
possibly
be
construed
as
creating
a
vested
right
in
the
landowner
to
the
bed
of
the
stream.
and
there
is
no
case
in
nebraska,
which
involves
the
bed
of
a
navigable
stream.
every
case
in
which
any
remark
has
been
made
about
this
is
our
law,
private
ownership
to
the
thread
has
involved
either
accretions
in
being
or
it
has
involved
the
platte
river,
which
is
a
non-navigable
stream.
so,
we
say
that
all
the
statements
that
nebraska
court
has
ever
made
about
it
are
in
the
nature
of
dicta.
and,
we
agree
that
dicta,
perhaps
creates
the
law
of
nebraska,
but
it
doesn't
create
vested
rights,
which
the
nebraska
unicameral
couldn't
change
and
it's
our
position
in
this
case
that
when
the
nebraska
unicameral
ceded
to
iowa
everything
east
of
the
new
boundary
then
it
was
she
it
was
the
unicameral
that
was
changing
the
law
that
would
be
equitable
to
those
areas.
and,
they
were
saying
hereafter,
the
law
of
iowa
shall
apply
to
them.
nebraska
said
that
the
unicameral
couldn't
do
that,
because
these
landowners
had
vested
rights
in
the
bed
of
the
river.
we
say
no,
they
had
no
vested
rights,
and
therefore,
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
could
have
changed
their
common
law
concerning
ownership
of
their
riverbeds
they
never
have,
but
they
could
have.
and
legislature
possessed
the
power
to
change
the
nebraska
law
and
in
so
far
as
it's
applicable
to
lands
east
of
the
boundary,
that's
precisely
what
the
unicameral
did.
the
special
master
agreed
with
us
on
this
proposition
and
at
page
193
of
his
report,
he
sets
out
his
proposed
rule
for
determining
ownership
of
lands,
which
have
formed
since
the
compact,
since
1943.
and
by
the
way
to
give
you
some
idea
of
what's
involved
here;
iowa
now
claims
to
own
approximately
30
areas,
up
and
down
the
river,
between
sioux
city
and
the
missouri
state
line.
approximately,
eight
of
these
areas
were
in
existence
at
the
time
the
compact
was
entered
into.
and
the
remaining
22
areas
have
come
into
existence,
since
the
compact.
mr.
moldenhauer
mentioned
that
one
case
has
gone
as
far
as
the
eight
circuit
concerning
the
ownership
of
one
of
these
tracks
of
land.
a
track
of
land
which
is
now
involved
here
and
included
in
the
30
areas,
which
iowa
claims
to
own.
and
this
case
was
entitled
in
circuit
court,
tyson
versus
iowa,
decided
in
1960.
mr.
moldenhauer
has
very
roughly,
but
correctly
related
the
facts
of
tyson
after
1943,
the
river
escaped
from
the
designed
channel,
which
was
west
of
the
area,
the
area
being
in
iowa.
it
escaped
by
washing
away
its
left
bank
and
stabilizing
structures
and
ultimately
the
left
bank
moved
approximately
a
mile
and
a
half
into
iowa.
in
the
meantime,
the
right
bank
or
nebraska
bank
remained
stationary.
when
the
river
acquired
a
width
of
a
mile
and
a
half,
of
course
it
became
shallow
and
an
island
arose
on
the
iowa
side
of
the
boundary
but
west
of
the
thalweg
of
the
river.
in
other
words,
on
the
nebraska
side
of
the
thalweg,
but
on
the
iowa
side
of
the
boundary.
both
the
district
court,
judge
hickland
(ph)
and
the
circuit
court
held
that
the
island
belong
to
iowa
because
it
had
arisen
over
and
has
an
accretion
to
the
state
own
bed
of
the
river.
now,
nebraska
recognizes
in
this
case
that
if
they
are
to
have
their
construction
of
the
compact,
and
if
they
are
going
to
have
their
way,
the
tyson
decision
must
be
overruled
or
at
least
disavowed.
the
special
master
considered
that
proposition
very
carefully
and
concluded
that
the
tyson
case
was
right.
the
law
of
the
tyson
case
is
valid
and
that
it
should
not
be
overruled
and
disavowed,
it's
about
that
simple.
and
the
law
which
comes
out
of
the
tyson
case,
as
far
as
we're
concerned
is
about
this,
that
tyson's
right
to
accrete
by
nebraska
law
was
limited
to
the
state
boundary.
and
he
could
not
before
the
compact
and
cannot
since
the
compact
accrete
by
nebraska
law
into
iowa.
secondly,
if
tyson
were
to
accrete
into
iowa,
he
could
only
do
so,
under
iowa
law.
now,
there
is
a
possibility
that
a
nebraska
landowner
could
accrete
into
iowa
under
iowa
law,
because
iowa
recognizes
that
the
private
riparian
owner
becomes
the
owner
of
accretions
which
formed
to
his
high
bank.
the
thing
that
iowa
law
denies
is
that
a
private
riparian
owner
of
either
state
can
accrete
under
the
water.
now,
nebraska
lets
the
man
accrete
under
the
water,
because
his
boundary,
by
nebraska
law
is
the
thalweg.
and
wherever
the
thalweg
goes,
there
goes
his
boundary,
but
not
by
iowa
law.
it
inheres
in
the
tyson
decision
that
the
common
law
of
iowa,
which
has
been
in
effect
since
1856
is
still
in
effect
in
inheres
in
tyson
that
it
wasn't
repealed
by
the
compact
and
it
inheres
in
the
decision
that
iowa
didn't
sign
a
way
her
rights
to
claim
ownership
of
lands,
river
beds,
and
so
forth
by
its
operation.
actually,
the
tyson
case
simply
follows
a
long
line
of
cases
by
this
court
of
which
arkansas
versus
tennessee
is
an
example.
there've
been
several
arkansas-tennessee
cases
and
the
one
i
refer
to
is
246
u.s.
158.
the
special
master
quotes
from
that
decision
at
page
188
of
his
report.
so,
the
law
that
came
out
of
tyson
isn't
anything
new.
it's
the
same
law
that
this
court
has
been
applying
for
years.
also,
i
might
mention
that
in
order
for
nebraska
to
have
her
way
about
this
case,
the
case
of
state
of
iowa
versus
raymond
by
the
iowa
supreme
court
in
1963
would
have
to
be
overruled
and
disavowed.
mr.
michael
murray
no,
but
it
inheres
in
the
case
that
the
iowa
common
law
is
the
iowa
common
law.
mr.
michael
murray
no,
i
don't
so.
mr.
michael
murray
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
the
question,
your
honor,
but
i
--
mr.
michael
murray
oh!
sure
they
do.
i
am
sorry
if
i
--
mr.
michael
murray
yes.
mr.
michael
murray
no,
just
some
of
them.
now,
actually
--
mr.
michael
murray
tyson's
secondary
position,
i
would
say,
in
the
tyson
case
was
that
a
compact
didn't
affect
his
rights.
so,
in
a
manner
of
speaking
he
was
raising
a
compact,
but
it
was
in
a
negative
manner.
mr.
michael
murray
it's
available
to
everybody
that
has
an
interest
in
those
river
lands
and
the
ownership
of
them.
mr.
michael
murray
yes.
but
i've
got
beat,
because
tyson
never
did
have
any
rights
to
accrete
into
iowa
and
the
compact
doesn't
create
that
right
in
him
either.
mr.
michael
murray
yes.
mr.
michael
murray
and
that's
the
part
of
the
master's
report,
which
we
do
not
accept
to.
mr.
michael
murray
nebraska
accepts
to
that.
my
time
is
almost
up
and
i
haven't
gotten
even
to
our
exception,
which
is
to
the
special
master's
proposed
rule
for
determination
of
ownership
of
the
areas,
which
had
formed
prior
to
1943
and
which
were
in
existence
at
that
time.
we
feel
the
master
is
wrong
about
that
rule,
because
he
--
mr.
michael
murray
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
effect
of
the
special
master's
rule
for
pre
1943
areas
is
to
destroy
utterly
the
law
which
we've
always
known
as
the
law
of
boundaries
or
as
the
law
of
accretion.
and
he
supplants
another
law
in
place
of
it.
in
to
the
(inaudible)
under
the
special
master's
proposed
rule
for
the
pre
1943
areas
goes,
the
presumption
in
favor
of
accretion
and
against
avulsion.
under
the
special
master's
rule,
iowa
would
be
deprived
of
the
benefit
of
that
presumption,
which
this
court
recognizes
and
as
far
as
i
know,
every
court
that
ever
had
an
opportunity
recognizes.
he
destroys
the
presumption
in
favor
of
the
permanency
of
boundaries,
which
this
court
utilized
in
the
former
case
of
nebraska
versus
iowa
and
where
this
court
said
in
substance,
what
is
more
natural
when
people
are
dividing
lands
to
use
a
river
as
a
boundary.
mr.
michael
murray
practically
the
same,
the
result
is
the
same,
yes.
what
happens
under
the
special
master's
rule
to
the
proposition
that
a
state
suing
another
state
for
violation
of
anything
must
clear,
must
prove
her
case,
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
it's
gone.
and
what
happens
to
the
rule?
that
any
presumption
must
overcome
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
now,
the
special
master's
rule
simply
wipes
out
all
those
things,
which
we
have
thought
for
years,
where
the
law
of
accretion,
the
law
of
boundaries
and
puts
the
thing
entirely
on
one
basis
as
to
the
areas
prior
to
1943.
and
that
basis
is
was
very
title
in
nebraska
to
it
as
of
1943.
my
time
is
up.
i
thank
you
very
much.
