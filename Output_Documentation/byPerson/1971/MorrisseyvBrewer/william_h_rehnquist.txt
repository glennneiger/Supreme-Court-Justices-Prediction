mr.
brittin,
i
--
as
i
understand
the
record,
the
parole
officer
had
talked
to
morrissey,
he
--
had
he
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
as
i
understand
respondent's
contention,
morrissey
pretty
well
admitted
the
charges
against
him.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
brittin,
did
the
parole
board
hear
after
your
client
had
been
returned
to
prison,
interview
him
with
respect
to
the
alleged
parole
violation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
would
you
distinguish
between
what
was
done
and
what
you
think
ought
to
have
been
done
in
the
way
of
a
hearing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
your
brief?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
not
intending
here
that
he's
entitled
to
counsel
at
this
hearing,
are
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
point
in
--
in
this
proceeding
that
he
is
--
he
was
entitled
to
counsel
as
well
as
to
a
hearing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
brittin,
would
you
contend
that
a
hearing
is
also
required
when
the
parole
board
sits
to
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
parole
should
be
granted
or
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
that
an
equally
important
stage
in
the
criminal
proceeding
or
doesn't
that
equally
affect
the
substantial
rights
of
the
defendant?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
question
is
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
conduct
consists
of
factual
matters,
and
i
suppose
it's
conceivable
a
board
might
be
misinformed,
shouldn't
be
--
shouldn't
he
be
entitled
to
cross-examine
at
least
factual
witnesses
at
that
stage
on
his
conduct,
if
you're
right?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
to
argue
mitigating
circumstances?
