white
how
about
the
automobile?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
that
--
was
that
in
violation
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
he
admitted
that
one
act
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there's
no
dispute
about
the
facts
on
that
particular
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
was
just
a
question
of
--
of
whether
or
not
that
should
amount
to
a
violation
of
the
parole.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
even
if
--
that
even
if
there
was
a
violation
of
whether
the
parole
should
be
revoked.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
--
do
you
think
that
the
parole
officer's
conversation
was
that
these
parolees
gave
--
at
least
established
a
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
violation
had
occurred?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
--
are
you
--
you
don't
object
to
the
fact
that
if
having
found
out
what
he
found
out,
the
parole
officer
could
arrest
them
and
detain
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
that
arrest
and
detention
pending
a
hearing
would
be
satisfactory
as
far
as
you
are
concerned.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
let's
just
assume
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
i'm
not
saying
this
is
--
this
kind
of
a
case,
but
let's
just
assume
that
there
was
no
need
because
of
the
admissions
of
a
series
of
events,
acts
and
you
call
them
technical
violations
if
you
want
to.
let's
assume
that
there's
no
need
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
as
to
what
the
facts
were.
and
it's
just
a
question
of
a
judgment
as
to
whether
a
parole
should
be
revoked.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
wouldn't
if
--
i
suppose
if
you've
got
a
man,
a
probationer,
for
example,
before
a
court
had
--
in
the
court
and
the
judge
said,
"did
you
do
these
things?"
and
he
said,
"yes."
we
don't
need
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
will
be
after
--
after
he'd
been
arrested
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
incarcerated.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
the
parole
board
--
if
he
is
returned
to
jail
and
then
the
parole
board
calls
him
before
them
and
he
has
an
opportunity
to
say
yes
or
no
or
to
say
whatever
he
wants
to,
that's
enough.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
--
that
is
if
he
denies
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
said
if
he
--
you
said
he
--
he
could
be
arrested
that
there's
probable
cause
to
believe
that
he
had
violated
his
parole.
now,
after
he
--
do
you
mean
he
--
that
constitutionally,
he
could
be
arrested
but
then
he
must
be
released
again?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
there's
some
finding
that
he's
dangerous
he
must
be
--
he
has
to
be
released
after
bail.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
was
rather
held
in
the
city
jail
and
in
some
jails
--
justice
byron

(voice

is
that
--
is
that
the

byron

all

you.

justice

but
then
it
wouldn't

didn't
take

until

it

that
instead
of
calling
the

the

the

takes
when

revokes

you
could
get

this
is

it's
