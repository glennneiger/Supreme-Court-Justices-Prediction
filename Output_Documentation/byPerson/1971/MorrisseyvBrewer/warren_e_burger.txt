we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
number
71-5103,
morrissey
and
booher
against
brewer.
mr.
brittin.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
before
you
proceed,
counsel,
let
me
mention
one
other
factor
that
mr.
justice
marshall
is
unavoidably
absent
this
morning
but
he
will
participate
in
the
cases
to
be
heard
today
on
the
basis
of
the
files,
records,
briefs
and
the
recording
of
the
oral
argument.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
incurred
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
the
automobile
purchase
in
that
category,
mr.
brittin?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
with
--
in
under
a
false
name?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
--
chief

e.
burger
--
would
it
constitute
--
i
thought
you
would
--
indicated
to
justice
white
that
that
would
be
a
basis
for
revoking
parole.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
it's
admitted,
if
it's
admitted
then
why
do
you
need
proof?
is
--
is
it
--
would
you
say
that
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
analogize
that
to
a
plea
of
guilty
to
a
charge?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
how
long
after
the
--
the
arrest
on
parole
violation
was
this
interview
process
held?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
i
correctly
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
remember
that
it
was
about
29
or
30
days
something?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
where
do
you
think
he
should
be
between
the
time
he
is
arrested
for
the
parole
violation
and
the
time
of
the
hearing?
would
it
be
inappropriate
for
him
to
be
back
at
the
prison?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
he
have
--
had
the
interview
that
you've
described
at
the
institution,
does
this
record
show
that
he
then
admitted
that
he
had
bought
the
car
under
a
false
name?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
assuming
now
that
at
that
interview,
the
facts
stated
at
the
top
of
page
68
that
he
admitted
that
he
bought
the
1960
chevrolet
and
so
forth
and
registered
it
under
a
false
name
and
having
in
mind
that
in
one
of
the
conditions
of
his
parole
as
that
he
would
neither
own
nor
operate
an
automobile
and
other
vehicles
without
the
consent
of
the
chief
parole
officer,
would
you
think
that
would
be
grounds
for
making
the
decision
without
hearing
any
further
from
him
after
his
admission?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
say
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
you
say
he's
going
to
be
in
custody
while
he
is
waiting
for
that
trial.
isn't
the
contrary
more
likely
to
be
true
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
could
be
applied?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
understand
your
arguments
that
it's
a
--
perhaps
a
technical
violation
to
leave
the
county
in
order
to
get
a
job
under
the
circumstances
of
booher's
case,
but
as
to
morrissey
where
he
bought
the
car
under
a
false
name
and
he
entered
in
the
contracts
in
which
he
signed
the
names
of
other
persons
to
purchase
furniture
and
various
things,
you
wouldn't
really
call
those
technical
violations,
would
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
one
is
either
fraud
or
forgery.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
--
even
if
parts
of
it
were,
there's
nothing
vague
about
the
majority
of
the
provisions,
is
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
is
--
your
time
is
up,
mr.
brittin.
mr.
seuferer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
take
you
to
the
setting
in
which
the
parole
officer
has
received
some
information
that
--
that
violations
may
have
occurred
but
--
before
he
has
completed
his
investigation
and
made
his
report
to
the
state
parole
board,
now,
in
that
setting,
does
he
contact
the
prisoner
as
a
matter
of
practise
the
parolee
and
confront
him
with
the
suggestion
of
violations
and
give
him
an
opportunity
to
explain
them
or
answer
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(voice

case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
did
they
do
that
always?
chief

e.

practise.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
seuferer,
i'm
looking
at
page
67
of
the
appendix
now.
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
is
--
under
roman
numeral
iii,
parolee's
version
of
the
offenses
and
that
is
followed
by
a
summary
of
the
effort
on
the
part
of
the
parole
officer
to
get
a
response.
and
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
that's
followed
in
turn
by
a
recital
of
previous
violations
and
his
parole
history.
is
this
report,
if
you
know,
typical
of
the
types
of
reports
which
the
parole
agents
make
to
the
board
in
connection
with
the
proposed
revocation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
you've
said
in
response
to
some
questions
from
the
bench
that
before
the
warrant,
the
violation,
parole
violation
warrant
is
served
in
the
arrest
made,
there
is
some
local
magistrate
or
officer,
a
neutral
officer
who
issues
that
magistrate,
just
who
is
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
municipal
judge
or
what
kind
of
an
officer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it's
a
local
--
it's
a
person
in
the
locality
where
the
agent
and
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
violator.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
administratively
be
feasible
if
the
process
that's
covered
in
this
report
of
the
parole
officer
be
presented
to
that
local
magistrate
or
whatever
other
officer
may
be
involved
on
the
warrant
and
have
him
at
least
make
a
preliminary
determination
and
give
the
parolee
an
opportunity
to
answer
to
the
specific
charges
before
the
revocation
--
before
the
arrest
was
made?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
remember
in
hyser
against
reed
that
was
what
was
ordered
with
respect
to
the
federal
system
that
within
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
within
a
reasonable
time,
after
the
determination
of
a
probable
violation,
the
parolee
must
be
given
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
to
show
why
he
should
not
be
arrested
and
returned
to
the
federal
institution.
chief
