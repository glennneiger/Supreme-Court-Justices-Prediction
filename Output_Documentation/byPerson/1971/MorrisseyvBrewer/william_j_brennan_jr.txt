i
noticed

justice

just
in
your

you
say
something
about
only
two

justice
william
j.

as
i
gather
it
must
mean
that
there'd
been

not
more
than
three,
if
not
many,
who
have
released
again
on
parole.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

and
what
--
what
about
the
credit
for
the
time
in
jail
on
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
one
--
one
in
the
booher
case
though
of
--
the
counsel
suggest
that
at
--
in
booher's
instance,
he
left
the
county,
all
right,
but
he
--
he
did
because
his
wife
was
having
a
baby
in
some
other
county
and/or
because
he
had
a
job
offer.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

might
that
not
--
there
may
be
violations,
but
might
they
not
be
weighed
that
--
by
the
hearing
and
as
--
as
not
justifying
in
the
circumstances
of
revocation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
in
the
booher's
case,
i
gather,
the
only
other
violation
was
that
he
was
driving
a
car
with
that
car
registered
in
his
wife's
name
and
without
the
consent
of
the
parole
officer,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

he
--
that
one
of
his
conditions
was
that
he
would
neither
own
nor
operate
an
airplane,
automobile
this
sort
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

--
without

consent
of

chief
parole
officer.

william

temper.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

but
actually
a
loss
of
his
liberty
depends,
doesn't
it,
on
--
on
the
parole
officer
when
he
comes
up
with
the
report
like
this,
automatically
he's
picked
up
at

--
on
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

that's
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

so
automatically
then
he's
picked
up
on
that
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
now,
tell
me
what
the
process
is.
the
report's
filed
with
whom?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

--
and
then
what's
--
what's
the
procedure
then
which
leads
to
an
order
of
revocation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
wouldn't
they
be
by
telephone
or

justice
william
j.
brennan,

and
until

the
