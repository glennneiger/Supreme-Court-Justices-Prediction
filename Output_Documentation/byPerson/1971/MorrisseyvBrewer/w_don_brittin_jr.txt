mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
counsel
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
was
appointed
by
this
court
to
represent
petitioners
in
this
case
which
is
a
--
which
are
habeas
corpus
cases.
i
was
likewise
appointed
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
to
represent
petitioners
in
the
--
in
the
cases
below.
the
opinion
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
which
is
under
review
in
this
case
affirmed
the
orders
of
judge
stephenson,
at
that
time,
united
states
district
judge
for
--
for
the
southern
district
of
iowa,
denying
both
the
petitions
involved
in
these
cases.
petitioners
had
both
been
prisoners
in
the
iowa
state
penitentiary
and
had
both
been
and
--
had
both
received
paroles
from
the
iowa
board
of
parole.
subsequently,
each
of
their
respective
paroles
were
revoked
by
the
iowa
board
of
parole
such
revocations
having
been
accomplished
without
either
of
the
petitioners
having
been
afforded
any
type
of
evidentiary
hearing
to
establish
the
fact
of
parole
violation.
both
petitioners
alleged
in
their
petitions
for
habeas
corpus
filed
in
the
district
court
that
their
constitutional
rights
to
due
process
of
law
had
been
violated
by
the
action
of
the
iowa
board
of
parole
in
revoking
their
paroles
without
a
hearing,
and
that
such
state
action
constitute
--
constituted
a
deprivation
of
liberty
without
due
process
of
law.
judge
stephenson
in
separate
orders
denied
their
respective
petitions
holding
that
the
applicable
--
iowa
statutory
law
did
not
require
such
a
hearing
and
that
the
procedures
followed
by
the
iowa
board
of
parole
had
been
held
sufficient
for
federal
constitutional
purposes.
after
granting
the
certificates
of
probable
cause,
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
heard
the
cases
en
banc
and
by
a
vote
of
4-to-3
affirmed
the
order
--
orders
of
judge
stephenson.
this
court
granted
a
certiorari
on
december
of
last
year.
the
question
then
presented
for
review
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
the
action
of
the
iowa
board
of
parole
in
revoking
petitioners'
respective
paroles
without
providing
either
of
said
petitioners
a
prior
evidentiary
hearing
to
establish
the
fact
of
parole
violation,
denied
petitioners'
liberty
without
due
process
of
law
in
violation
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
at
this
point,
i
believe,
a
brief
factual
review
of
the
circumstances
is
appropriate.with
respect
to
petitioner
morrissey
first,
he
entered
a
plea
of
guilty
to
a
county
--
county
attorney's
information
charging
him
with
false
uttering
of
a
check
and
was
sentenced
by
an
iowa
state
district
court
to
the
iowa
state
penitentiary
for
a
term
of
seven
years.
after
serving
approximately
one
and
a
half
years
of
his
sentence,
morrissey
was
granted
a
parole
by
the
iowa
board
of
parole.
after
being
on
parole
approximately
seven
months,
he
was
arrested
for
a
parole
violation,
confined
in
the
county
jail
and
shortly
thereafter,
his
parole
agent
filed
a
written
report
of
violation
with
the
iowa
board
of
parole
recommending
that
his
parole
be
revoked.
three
days
later,
an
order
was
entered
by
the
iowa
board
of
parole
revoking
his
parole
and
ordering
that
he
be
returned
to
the
penitentiary.
this
order
was
entered
by
the
iowa
board
of
parole
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
parole
officer's
written
report
without
granting
the
petitioner
a
hearing
of
any
kind
to
determine
the
fact
of
parole
violation.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
i
believe
you
are
correct,
your
honor,
that
he
had
talked
to
morrissey
in
jail
at
the
time
he
had
been
arrested
after
the
--
the
parole
agent
got
the
warrant
for
his
arrest
for
parole
violation.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
you
are
correct
in
saying
that
it
is
respondent's
contention,
if
i
understand
his
contention
--
actually
i
don't
wish
to
speak
for
him
but
i
do
believe
that
he
contends
that
morrissey
admitted
at
that
time
that
he
violated
the
conditions
of
this
parole.
however,
it
is
our
position
that
he
did
not
unequivocably
admit
the
alleged
violations.
he
admitted
certain
acts
which
may
have
constituted
violations
if
there
were
--
were
no
explanations
for
them.
he
did
offer
explanation
for
certain
of
his
acts
which,
i
believe,
were
in
mitigation
and
may
tend
to
establish
that
he
did
not
in
fact
violate
his
parole.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
the
automobile?
he
admitted
that
he
had
purchased
an
automobile
under
an
assumed
name.
i
might
point
out
here
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
the
parole
agreement
specifically
required
or
prohibited
him
from
doing
that
but
i
think
that
--
that
act
was
probably
in
violation
of
his
parole.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
he
admitted
the
act,
that's
right,
your
honor.
he
did
not
admit
that
he
had
violated
his
parole
but
he
did
--
you
are
correct
to
say
and
he
did
admit
and
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
about
the
automobile?
i
think
you're
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
that's
right
and
whether
or
not
that
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
that's
right.
and
i
might
point
at
this
time
that
both
with
respect
to
petitioners,
morrissey
and
booher,
and
this
situation
was
similar
with
booher.
he
was
sentenced
and
served
two
and
a
half
years,
paroled.
he
was
out
about
nine
months.
and
then
he
--
he
was
arrested
for
a
parole
violation.
the
parole
agent
filed
a
written
report
to
the
board
of
parole,
revoked
his
parole
on
the
basis
of
that
written
report.
the
violations
with
respect
to
booher
were
quite
similar
to
the
ones
in
morrissey.
he
had
--
he
was
alleged
to
have
been
driving
an
automobile
without
the
permission
of
his
parole
officer
and
while
his
license
was
under
suspension.
he
was
accused
of
leaving
the
territorial
limits
of
o'brien
county,
iowa
without
the
parole
officer's
permission.
and
he
was
accused
of
not
being
able
to
keep
a
job.
these
things
--
and
i
think
that
he
admitted
operating
the
motor
vehicle.
it
was
his
--
apparently
it
was
his
wife's
vehicle,
but
he
did
admit
operating
the
motor
vehicle
without
the
permission
of
his
chief
parole
officer.
i
might
point
that
these
violations,
what
we're
talking
about
are
--
were
may
be
called
technical
violations.
they
are
vital
x
which
constitute
the
--
the
charge
x
if
proven
would
constitute
technical
violations
of
the
parole
agreement.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
it
is
not
alleged
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
i
don't
believe
the
--
the
purchase
of
an
automobile
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
i
don't
believe
that
that
would
be
--
that
would
necessarily
constitute
a
crime,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
certainly
deception
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
i
--
i
think
i
indicated
to
him
that
--
that
if
proven,
that
fact
would
constitute
an
act
which
might
form
the
basis
of
a
revocation
of
parole.
however,
it's
a
technical
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
i
think
there's
a
great
difference,
your
honor,
because
the
only
evidence
in
this
record
and
i
think
the
only
evidence
that
there
is
at
all
whether
inside
or
outside
of
the
record
is
with
respect
to
what
the
statements
that
the
--
that
the
parolee
made
to
his
parole
agent
while
he
was
in
custody,
and
i
don't
believe
that
--
that
the
board
of
parole
or
anyone
else
should
rely
solely
upon
those
statements
when
submitted
to
the
board
of
parole
in
written
form
to
--
as
a
basis
for
a
parole
revocation.
i
believe
that
the
parolee
should
be
given
a
chance
to
tell
the
board
of
parole
to
admit
or
deny
to
the
board
of
parole
whether
or
not
he
is
violating
his
parole.
and
i
think
he
should
have
an
opportunity
to
appear
before
the
board
and
to
confront
and
cross-examine
the
persons
who
are
making
allegations
against
him
be
it
the
parole
officer
or
other
persons.
what
we're
talking
about
is
a
situation
in
which
a
parole
which
is
a
--
we
don't
want
to
call
it
a
right
or
a
privilege,
i
don't
think
it's
correct
to
call
it
either.
it's
a
status
enjoyed
by
the
--
the
parolee,
and
we're
talking
about
the
revocation
of
that
based
upon
a
written
statement
by
a
parole
agent.
i
think
that
the
constitution
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
i
think
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
there
is.
it's
at
page
100
of
the
appendix,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
in
fact
the
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
in
fact
the
one
at
page
100
is
a
form
of
parole
agreement
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
--
that
was
submitted
to
the
district
court.
is
not
--
it
was
not
ever
established,
and
i
do
--
do
not
know
if
this
is
the
exact
form
that
was
signed
by
either
one
of
the
petitioners
herein
is
that
those
forms
have
never
been
produced
in
this
case.
but
this
is
--
my
understanding
is
the
standard
form
of
a
parole
agreement
which
is
used
in
the
state
of
iowa.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
presumably,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
i've
--
i've
--
you
may
be
correct,
your
honor,
except
that
i
do
not
know
that
any
condition
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
--
(voice
overlap)
conditions
were
added
in
either
of
these
cases.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
i
think
that
they
may
well
have
established
probable
cause
to
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
no,
i
don't
object
to
that,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
so
far
as
i'm
concerned
in
this
case,
your
honor,
that
would
be
satisfactory.
what
i'm
talking
about
in
this
case
is
the
--
is
the
revocation
of
parole
and
sending
a
parolee
back
to
serve
the
remainder
of
his
sentence
which
is
--
which
could
be
five
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
--
years.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
assuming
that
facts
have
been
established
and
i
would
maintain
that
those
facts
should
be
established
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
--
by
hearing.
but
assuming
that
they
have
been
established
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
no,
i
wouldn't
object
to
that
and
i
wouldn't
--
i
don't
think
i
would
object
to
it
if
the
parole
board
would
call
the
parolee
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
--
and
--
and
give
him
a
hearing
what
you're
talking
about
when
you're
talking
about
probation
or
being
before
the
court
is
what
i'm
talking
about
a
parolee
being
before
the
parole
board
and
having
a
chance
to
admit
or
deny
the
allegations
to
--
to
present
evidence
on
his
own
behalf
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
after
he
had
been
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
--
arrested
and
--
and
incarcerated
and
if
that
time
is
a
reasonable
time
that
i
--
is
not
what
i'm
talking
about
in
this
case.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
if
he
has
an
opportunity
to
admit
or
deny
the
allegations
to
confront
and
cross-examine
the
witnesses
who've
kept
--
who
may
offer
evidence
in
his
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
if
he
denies
them.
if
--
if,
your
honor,
if
he
admits
the
violations
to
the
parole
board
under
circumstances
from
which
it
is
clear
that
he
does
so
voluntarily
and
knowing
the
consequences
of
his
admission,
then
i
have
no
objection
to
a
parole
revocation
in
that
circumstances
without
further
proceedings.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
i
think
that
they
did
interview
him
and
that
word
is
very
critical,
your
honor.
i
think
the
word
is
interview.
they
did
not
give
him
a
hearing.
they
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
very
frankly,
your
honor,
i
was
unaware
until
the
respondents
filed
their
brief
herein
that
there
was
any
such
interview
at
all.
and
i
know
nothing
more
about
that
hearing
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
--
that
is
in
the
respondent's
brief.
so
i
don't
know
what
happened
at
that
hearing.
i
--
i
do
know
there
is
a
--
is
a
thing
called
a
post-revocation
interview
but
i
don't
what
happens
there.
i
don't
who's
there.
i
don't
whether
--
of
course,
this
is
--
occurs
at
a
time
after
the
parolee
is
already
back
in
prison.
and
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
that
a
hearing
at
that
time
satisfies
the
requirements
of
due
process.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
from
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
--
respondents
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
from
respondent's
brief,
i
--
i
know
that
it
was
not
more
than
two
months
after
the
revocation.
now,
the
arrest
for
violation
was
another
approximately
week
or
two
weeks
depending
on
whether
we're
talking
about
morrissey
or
booher
prior
to
the
revocation.
i
think,
your
honor,
that
any
hearing
--
the
kind
of
hearing
i'm
talking
about
is
a
hearing
prior
to
the
order
of
revocation.
once
the
order
of
revocation,
once
the
parole
is
revoked,
the
prisoner
is
back
in
prison,
and
i
don't
think
a
hearing
at
that
time
is
sufficient
for
constitutional
purposes.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
i
think
if
he
is
--
if
there's
evidence
that
his
presence
in
society
as
any
other
person
that
as
a
parolee
would
be
dangerous
to
society
that
he
--
i
do
not
object
to
his
incarceration.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
no,
i
--
i
--
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make,
your
honor,
is
that
if
this
person
was
a
dangerous
person,
i
--
i
think
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
--
that
he
should
be
incarcerated
pending
the
--
if
there's
probable
cause
to
believe
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
no,
i
don't
--
i
really
don't
think
that's
important.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
well
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
i
think
that
the
hearing
should
be
held
within
a
short
time.
i'm
talking
about
a
week
or
so
and
--
and
i
--
in
--
in
iowa
only
because
the
penitentiary
is
way
off
down
one
corner
of
the
state.
i
think
transporting
a
prisoner
back
and
forth
may
not
be
necessary
and
--
and
holding
him
in
the
county
jail
for
a
period
of
week
or
so
particularly
so
he
can
talk
to
counsel
if
he
has
some
--
so
he
can
make
preparations
for
the
hearing
would
be
appropriate
to
the
case,
and
i
don't
think
that
it
would
be
necessary
to
return
him
to
prison.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
i
think
that
once
it
is
determined
that
a
petitioner
is
entitled
to
a
hearing,
prior
to
revocation
of
his
parole
and
considering
the
--
the
substantial
interest
he
has
in
his
continued
liberty,
that
there
is
authority
for
this
court
to
hold
that
he
is
entitled
to
counsel
at
such
a
hearing.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
the
issues
in
this
case
are
--
are,
by
the
record,
limited
to
the
right
to
hearing
and
do
not
include
the
question
of
the
right
to
counsel.
however,
i
do
believe
that
if
this
court
feels
that
the
constitution
does
require
a
hearing
prior
to
revocation
of
parole
that
due
to
the
serious
nature
of
the
consequences
to
a
parolee
should
his
parole
be
revoked
without
a
hearing
and
in
that,
in
compliance
with
the
constitution
that
there
is
sufficient
authority
for
this
court
to
also
hold
that
he
should
be
entitled
to
appoint
a
counsel
should
he
not?
she
--
he
should
be
entitled
at
least
to
have
retained
counsel
present.
that's
--
that,
however,
goes
to
the
kind
of
hearing
that's
required.
and
i
think
it's
first
and
most
important
for
the
court
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
hearing
is
required.
and
of
course,
it's
our
contention
that
it
is.
and
--
and
in
contending
that
a
hearing
is
required,
we
rely
principally
upon
that
line
of
cases
of
--
of
this
court
which
have
held
due
process
of
law
requires
a
hearing
and
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
whenever
important
rights
are
substantially
affected
by
state
action.
and
these
cases
i'm
talking
about
are
cases
like
goldberg
versus
kelly,
bell
versus
burson,
groppi
versus
leslie
and
greene
versus
mcelroy.
these
cases
all
held
that
a
hearing
and
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
are
required
prior
to
the
termination
by
state
action
of
various
types
of
rights
or
privileges
enjoyed
by
these
individuals.
and
the
types
of
rights
that
were
involved
in
those
cases
are
not
being
disqualified
for
unemployment
compensation,
an
individual's
interest
in
continued
welfare
benefits,
an
individual's
interest
in
not
having
his
name
arbitrarily
posted
on
a
pubic
list
of
excessive
drinkers,
an
individual's
interest
in
not
being
held
in
contempt
of
the
state
legislature
and
an
individual's
interest
in
uninsured
motorist's
interest,
in
not
having
his
driver's
license
suspended
after
an
accident.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
no,
i
would
not,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
it
does
--
i'm
--
you're
correct
that
it
does
affect
his
interest.
however,
i
think
that
what
is
most
important
in
that
situation
is
that
the
board
of
parole
in
sitting
on
determining
whether
or
not
to
release
a
person
on
parole
is
guided
only
by
considerations
in
its
expertise
in
--
in
examining
the
conduct
of
the
prisoner
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
feel
that
he
is
a
good
risk
for
parole
and
should
be
permitted
to
go
outside
of
the
walls
of
the
prison
and
attempt
to
--
to
continue
his
rehabilitation
which
they
believe
is
--
to
some
extent
at
that
point
on
the
outside
of
the
prison.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
after
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
i
suppose
an
argument
can
be
made
that
if
the
board
of
parole
denies
a
parole
when
considering
whether
or
not
to
--
to
give
a
parole,
denies
it
on
the
basis
of
allegations
of
fact
concerning
his
conduct
an
argument
could
be
made
that
he
should
be
entitled
to
appear
before
the
board
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
as
a
matter
of
practise,
most
--
as
i
understand,
most
prisoners
at
the
time
they
are
being
considered
for
parole
do
appear
before
a
board.
i
think
an
argument
could
be
made
that
he
should
be
entitled
to
some
hearing
at
that
time
but
i'm
not
making
that
argument
and
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
it's
critical
to
this
case
because
what
we're
talking
about
is
a
parolee
--
a
person
whom
the
board
of
parole
has
decided
is
worthy
of
this
conditional
liberty
of
parole
and
being
permitted
to
go
back
out
and
deciding
an
attempt
to
make
a
full
community
and
family
life,
to
contribute
to
the
society,
talking
about
revocation
of
that
status,
which
has
previously
been
granted
by
the
board
of
parole.
and
i
think
there
is
a
valid
distinction
now.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
that
is
the
report
with
respect
to
petitioner
morrissey
and
the
report
with
respect
to
petitioner
booher
is
at
page
106,
i
believe.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
now,
this
record
doesn't
even
show
that
there
was
such
a
hearing,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
nothing
in
the
record
in
the
district
court,
the
court
of
appeals
or
in
this
case
concerning
that
alleged
hearing.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
--
that
the
board
of
parole
should
after
his
admission
that
he
in
fact
purchased
an
automobile
under
assumed
name,
i
think
the
court
should
hear
from
him
his
explanation
whatever
reasons
that
there
may
be
in
mitigation.
i
can't
think
of
what
they
would
be
at
this
point
for
--
why
a
person
would
do
that
except
maybe
to
avoid
violation
of
a
specific
term
of
the
--
of
the
parole
agreement.
but
i
do
think
that
that
conduct
constitutes
a
violation
of
the
spirit
of
it,
if
not
the
technical
terms
of
it.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
i
think
that
that
--
that
the
hearing
relates
to
that
part.
most
importantly,
i
--
i
would
not
concede
that
--
that
presence
of
the
parolee
at
the
time
the
board
may
be
making
that
second
decision
may
not
be
of
assistance
to
the
board,
but
i
think
that,
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
a
right
to
hearing
on
the
determination
of
the
fact
of
violation
is
what
we're
talking
about
in
this
case.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
i
believe
that's
correct
that
the
hearing
could
be
terminated
once
the
board
of
parole
has
heard
from
the
parolee.
he
has
either
admitted
or
denied
the
violations.
if
he
has
admitted
he
may
offered
some
extenuating
circumstances
or
other
facts
in
mitigation.
at
that
point,
i
believe
it
would
be
proper
for
the
board
of
parole
to
adjourn
the
hearing
to
consider
and
deliberate
in
private
with
respect
to
what
action
should
be
taken
once
the
facts
have
been
established.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
i
believe
that
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
in
fact
in
this
case,
the
reported
violation
with
respect
to
petitioner
booher
shows
that
his
parole
agent
was
out
of
the
state
for
--
on
vacation
during
the
period
of
time
the
alleged
violations
occurred.
so
he
did
not
know
about
them
first
hand
anyway
that
he
was
accused
of
leaving
the
county
to
which
he
was
assigned
and
that
the
violation
shows
that
--
that
there
are
two
possible
reasons
for
leaving
the
county.
one
was
his
wife
was
--
went
to
iowa
city,
iowa
in
another
county
to
have
a
baby.
the
other
reason
was
that
he
was
--
he
was
having
trouble
keeping
himself
employed
and
he
left
the
county
to
work.
now,
one
of
the
conditions
of
parole
is
that
he
keep
himself
employed
and
another
one
is
that
he
not
leave
the
county.
his
parole
agent
was
out
of
the
state
and
he
left
the
county
to
work.
i
believe
that
circumstances
like
these
could
be
shown
at
a
hearing.
the
parole
agent
--
i
--
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
saying
here,
your
honor,
that
parole
agents
are
dirty
guys
and
we
shouldn't
believe
them
but
i'm
saying
that
there
are
circumstances
that
exist
that
were
biased
or
prejudiced
or
even
honest
misinformation
lead
to
the
parole
revocations
without
a
hearing,
and
i
believe
that
due
process
requires
that
before
a
parolee
is
--
has
his
condition
of
liberty
terminated,
he
is
sent
back
to
the
prison
for
five
to
seven
additional
years
that
he
is
entitled
to
a
hearing
to
establish
the
fact
that
the
parole
violation
before
the
board
goes
any
further
to
determine
whether
or
not
his
parole
should
be
terminated.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
and
to
argue
mitigating
circumstances
in
the
event
that
he
does
admit
the
fact.
take
the
situation
of
booher
leaving
the
county
to
find
--
to
--
to
work.
he
is
--
he's
in
the
heart
of
this
dilemma.
if
he
--
if
he
has
a
job
offer
outside
of
the
county,
he'll
be
violating
his
parole
agreement.
if
he
doesn't
take
it,
he'll
be
violating
the
parole
agreement
if
he
goes
out
of
the
county
to
work.
i
think
circumstances
like
these
particularly
when
the
--
when
the
revocation
is
based
on
what
we
may
call
technical
violations
that
parolee
is
entitled
to
a
hearing
to
establish
the
fact
of
violation.
if
the
parolee
is
charged
with
an
act
that
constitutes
a
crime
of
an
armed
robbery,
a
burglary
or
something
like
that,
the
criminal
process
comes
into
play.
he
can
be
arrested
for
a
violation
of
that
crime
and
once
he
is
convicted
of
that
crime,
he's
going
to
be
in
custody
probably
while
that
crime
is
being
considered.
once
he's
been
convicted
of
that
crime
i
have
no
objection
to
his
--
to
the
revocation
of
his
parole
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
--
based
upon
that
conviction.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
well
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
--
in
that
--
i
believe
you're
correct,
your
honor.
the
--
the
contrary
is
probably
if
he
is
charged
with
a
--
with
a
separate
crime
and
in
the
criminal
process,
he
probably
will
be
on
bail
during
that
time.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
they
may
--
they
are
certainly
not
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
i
think
that
in
booher's
case
in
this
respect
is
on
the
facts
of
the
violations
is
much
better
than
morrissey's
case.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
it's
a
matter
of
saying
that
there's
only
one
in
county.
and
actually
the
parole
agreement
if
you'll
examine,
it
requires
when
he
--
he
obtains
permission
to
do
something.
the
parole
agreement
says
he
has
to
obtain
permission
from
the
chief
parole
officer
which
is
in
--
they're
more
in
the
capital
of
the
state.
i
assume
that
when
the
parole
agent
is
on
gone
from
the
county
that
then
the
chief
parole
officer
in
des
moines
is
the
person
that
has
the
immediate
supervision
of
that
parolee.
it's
a
matter
of
saying
that
there's
no
other
agent
in
the
county
which
will
handle
it
at
time.
there
may
be
in
des
moines
and
some
of
the
other
larger
cities
of
the
state
more
than
one
parole
agent,
but
in
the
small
county
that
booher
was
from,
i'm
quite
confident,
there
would
be
not
more
than
one
agent
there.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
i
don't
--
i
can't
think
of
it,
your
honor.
it's
o'brien
county
except
in
the
northwest
part
of
the
state.
i
can't
tell
you
that
(inaudible)
right
now.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
you
know,
your
honor,
we
have
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
--
not
made
that
argument
here.
i
do
think
that
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
i
think
that
a
very
good
argument
could
be
made
that
--
that
this
--
this
type
of
thing
they're
talking
about
is
another
reason
why
a
hearing
may
be
--
may
be
critical
prior
to
revocation
of
this
parole.
but
we
are
not
making
the
argument
that
the
parole
agreement
should
held
beyond
constitutional
for
vagueness.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
no,
i
--
i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
an
argument
while
it'
s
also
not
germane
to
this
case,
an
argument
could
be
made
at
them.
parole
agreements
are
unfair
in
--
in
extending
some
conditions
that
should
not
be
extended
but
that
--
that
again
is
not
a
part
of
this
case.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
counsel
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
was
appointed
by
this
court
to
represent
petitioners
in
this
case
which
is
a
--
which
are
habeas
corpus
cases.
i
was
likewise
appointed
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
to
represent
petitioners
in
the
--
in
the
cases
below.
the
opinion
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
which
is
under
review
in
this
case
affirmed
the
orders
of
judge
stephenson,
at
that
time,
united
states
district
judge
for
--
for
the
southern
district
of
iowa,
denying
both
the
petitions
involved
in
these
cases.
petitioners
had
both
been
prisoners
in
the
iowa
state
penitentiary
and
had
both
been
and
--
had
both
received
paroles
from
the
iowa
board
of
parole.
subsequently,
each
of
their
respective
paroles
were
revoked
by
the
iowa
board
of
parole
such
revocations
having
been
accomplished
without
either
of
the
petitioners
having
been
afforded
any
type
of
evidentiary
hearing
to
establish
the
fact
of
parole
violation.
both
petitioners
alleged
in
their
petitions
for
habeas
corpus
filed
in
the
district
court
that
their
constitutional
rights
to
due
process
of
law
had
been
violated
by
the
action
of
the
iowa
board
of
parole
in
revoking
their
paroles
without
a
hearing,
and
that
such
state
action
constitute
--
constituted
a
deprivation
of
liberty
without
due
process
of
law.
judge
stephenson
in
separate
orders
denied
their
respective
petitions
holding
that
the
applicable
--
iowa
statutory
law
did
not
require
such
a
hearing
and
that
the
procedures
followed
by
the
iowa
board
of
parole
had
been
held
sufficient
for
federal
constitutional
purposes.
after
granting
the
certificates
of
probable
cause,
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
heard
the
cases
en
banc
and
by
a
vote
of
4-to-3
affirmed
the
order
--
orders
of
judge
stephenson.
this
court
granted
a
certiorari
on
december
of
last
year.
the
question
then
presented
for
review
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
the
action
of
the
iowa
board
of
parole
in
revoking
petitioners'
respective
paroles
without
providing
either
of
said
petitioners
a
prior
evidentiary
hearing
to
establish
the
fact
of
parole
violation,
denied
petitioners'
liberty
without
due
process
of
law
in
violation
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
at
this
point,
i
believe,
a
brief
factual
review
of
the
circumstances
is
appropriate.with
respect
to
petitioner
morrissey
first,
he
entered
a
plea
of
guilty
to
a
county
--
county
attorney's
information
charging
him
with
false
uttering
of
a
check
and
was
sentenced
by
an
iowa
state
district
court
to
the
iowa
state
penitentiary
for
a
term
of
seven
years.
after
serving
approximately
one
and
a
half
years
of
his
sentence,
morrissey
was
granted
a
parole
by
the
iowa
board
of
parole.
after
being
on
parole
approximately
seven
months,
he
was
arrested
for
a
parole
violation,
confined
in
the
county
jail
and
shortly
thereafter,
his
parole
agent
filed
a
written
report
of
violation
with
the
iowa
board
of
parole
recommending
that
his
parole
be
revoked.
three
days
later,
an
order
was
entered
by
the
iowa
board
of
parole
revoking
his
parole
and
ordering
that
he
be
returned
to
the
penitentiary.
this
order
was
entered
by
the
iowa
board
of
parole
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
parole
officer's
written
report
without
granting
the
petitioner
a
hearing
of
any
kind
to
determine
the
fact
of
parole
violation.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
i
believe
you
are
correct,
your
honor,
that
he
had
talked
to
morrissey
in
jail
at
the
time
he
had
been
arrested
after
the
--
the
parole
agent
got
the
warrant
for
his
arrest
for
parole
violation.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
you
are
correct
in
saying
that
it
is
respondent's
contention,
if
i
understand
his
contention
--
actually
i
don't
wish
to
speak
for
him
but
i
do
believe
that
he
contends
that
morrissey
admitted
at
that
time
that
he
violated
the
conditions
of
this
parole.
however,
it
is
our
position
that
he
did
not
unequivocably
admit
the
alleged
violations.
he
admitted
certain
acts
which
may
have
constituted
violations
if
there
were
--
were
no
explanations
for
them.
he
did
offer
explanation
for
certain
of
his
acts
which,
i
believe,
were
in
mitigation
and
may
tend
to
establish
that
he
did
not
in
fact
violate
his
parole.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
the
automobile?
he
admitted
that
he
had
purchased
an
automobile
under
an
assumed
name.
i
might
point
out
here
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
the
parole
agreement
specifically
required
or
prohibited
him
from
doing
that
but
i
think
that
--
that
act
was
probably
in
violation
of
his
parole.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
he
admitted
the
act,
that's
right,
your
honor.
he
did
not
admit
that
he
had
violated
his
parole
but
he
did
--
you
are
correct
to
say
and
he
did
admit
and
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
about
the
automobile?
i
think
you're
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
that's
right
and
whether
or
not
that
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
that's
right.
and
i
might
point
at
this
time
that
both
with
respect
to
petitioners,
morrissey
and
booher,
and
this
situation
was
similar
with
booher.
he
was
sentenced
and
served
two
and
a
half
years,
paroled.
he
was
out
about
nine
months.
and
then
he
--
he
was
arrested
for
a
parole
violation.
the
parole
agent
filed
a
written
report
to
the
board
of
parole,
revoked
his
parole
on
the
basis
of
that
written
report.
the
violations
with
respect
to
booher
were
quite
similar
to
the
ones
in
morrissey.
he
had
--
he
was
alleged
to
have
been
driving
an
automobile
without
the
permission
of
his
parole
officer
and
while
his
license
was
under
suspension.
he
was
accused
of
leaving
the
territorial
limits
of
o'brien
county,
iowa
without
the
parole
officer's
permission.
and
he
was
accused
of
not
being
able
to
keep
a
job.
these
things
--
and
i
think
that
he
admitted
operating
the
motor
vehicle.
it
was
his
--
apparently
it
was
his
wife's
vehicle,
but
he
did
admit
operating
the
motor
vehicle
without
the
permission
of
his
chief
parole
officer.
i
might
point
that
these
violations,
what
we're
talking
about
are
--
were
may
be
called
technical
violations.
they
are
vital
x
which
constitute
the
--
the
charge
x
if
proven
would
constitute
technical
violations
of
the
parole
agreement.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
it
is
not
alleged
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
i
don't
believe
the
--
the
purchase
of
an
automobile
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
i
don't
believe
that
that
would
be
--
that
would
necessarily
constitute
a
crime,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
certainly
deception
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
i
--
i
think
i
indicated
to
him
that
--
that
if
proven,
that
fact
would
constitute
an
act
which
might
form
the
basis
of
a
revocation
of
parole.
however,
it's
a
technical
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
i
think
there's
a
great
difference,
your
honor,
because
the
only
evidence
in
this
record
and
i
think
the
only
evidence
that
there
is
at
all
whether
inside
or
outside
of
the
record
is
with
respect
to
what
the
statements
that
the
--
that
the
parolee
made
to
his
parole
agent
while
he
was
in
custody,
and
i
don't
believe
that
--
that
the
board
of
parole
or
anyone
else
should
rely
solely
upon
those
statements
when
submitted
to
the
board
of
parole
in
written
form
to
--
as
a
basis
for
a
parole
revocation.
i
believe
that
the
parolee
should
be
given
a
chance
to
tell
the
board
of
parole
to
admit
or
deny
to
the
board
of
parole
whether
or
not
he
is
violating
his
parole.
and
i
think
he
should
have
an
opportunity
to
appear
before
the
board
and
to
confront
and
cross-examine
the
persons
who
are
making
allegations
against
him
be
it
the
parole
officer
or
other
persons.
what
we're
talking
about
is
a
situation
in
which
a
parole
which
is
a
--
we
don't
want
to
call
it
a
right
or
a
privilege,
i
don't
think
it's
correct
to
call
it
either.
it's
a
status
enjoyed
by
the
--
the
parolee,
and
we're
talking
about
the
revocation
of
that
based
upon
a
written
statement
by
a
parole
agent.
i
think
that
the
constitution
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
i
think
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
there
is.
it's
at
page
100
of
the
appendix,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
in
fact
the
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
in
fact
the
one
at
page
100
is
a
form
of
parole
agreement
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
--
that
was
submitted
to
the
district
court.
is
not
--
it
was
not
ever
established,
and
i
do
--
do
not
know
if
this
is
the
exact
form
that
was
signed
by
either
one
of
the
petitioners
herein
is
that
those
forms
have
never
been
produced
in
this
case.
but
this
is
--
my
understanding
is
the
standard
form
of
a
parole
agreement
which
is
used
in
the
state
of
iowa.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
presumably,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
i've
--
i've
--
you
may
be
correct,
your
honor,
except
that
i
do
not
know
that
any
condition
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
--
(voice
overlap)
conditions
were
added
in
either
of
these
cases.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
i
think
that
they
may
well
have
established
probable
cause
to
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
no,
i
don't
object
to
that,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
so
far
as
i'm
concerned
in
this
case,
your
honor,
that
would
be
satisfactory.
what
i'm
talking
about
in
this
case
is
the
--
is
the
revocation
of
parole
and
sending
a
parolee
back
to
serve
the
remainder
of
his
sentence
which
is
--
which
could
be
five
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
--
years.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
assuming
that
facts
have
been
established
and
i
would
maintain
that
those
facts
should
be
established
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
--
by
hearing.
but
assuming
that
they
have
been
established
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
no,
i
wouldn't
object
to
that
and
i
wouldn't
--
i
don't
think
i
would
object
to
it
if
the
parole
board
would
call
the
parolee
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
--
and
--
and
give
him
a
hearing
what
you're
talking
about
when
you're
talking
about
probation
or
being
before
the
court
is
what
i'm
talking
about
a
parolee
being
before
the
parole
board
and
having
a
chance
to
admit
or
deny
the
allegations
to
--
to
present
evidence
on
his
own
behalf
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
after
he
had
been
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
--
arrested
and
--
and
incarcerated
and
if
that
time
is
a
reasonable
time
that
i
--
is
not
what
i'm
talking
about
in
this
case.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
if
he
has
an
opportunity
to
admit
or
deny
the
allegations
to
confront
and
cross-examine
the
witnesses
who've
kept
--
who
may
offer
evidence
in
his
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
if
he
denies
them.
if
--
if,
your
honor,
if
he
admits
the
violations
to
the
parole
board
under
circumstances
from
which
it
is
clear
that
he
does
so
voluntarily
and
knowing
the
consequences
of
his
admission,
then
i
have
no
objection
to
a
parole
revocation
in
that
circumstances
without
further
proceedings.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
i
think
that
they
did
interview
him
and
that
word
is
very
critical,
your
honor.
i
think
the
word
is
interview.
they
did
not
give
him
a
hearing.
they
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
very
frankly,
your
honor,
i
was
unaware
until
the
respondents
filed
their
brief
herein
that
there
was
any
such
interview
at
all.
and
i
know
nothing
more
about
that
hearing
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
--
that
is
in
the
respondent's
brief.
so
i
don't
know
what
happened
at
that
hearing.
i
--
i
do
know
there
is
a
--
is
a
thing
called
a
post-revocation
interview
but
i
don't
what
happens
there.
i
don't
who's
there.
i
don't
whether
--
of
course,
this
is
--
occurs
at
a
time
after
the
parolee
is
already
back
in
prison.
and
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
that
a
hearing
at
that
time
satisfies
the
requirements
of
due
process.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
from
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
--
respondents
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
from
respondent's
brief,
i
--
i
know
that
it
was
not
more
than
two
months
after
the
revocation.
now,
the
arrest
for
violation
was
another
approximately
week
or
two
weeks
depending
on
whether
we're
talking
about
morrissey
or
booher
prior
to
the
revocation.
i
think,
your
honor,
that
any
hearing
--
the
kind
of
hearing
i'm
talking
about
is
a
hearing
prior
to
the
order
of
revocation.
once
the
order
of
revocation,
once
the
parole
is
revoked,
the
prisoner
is
back
in
prison,
and
i
don't
think
a
hearing
at
that
time
is
sufficient
for
constitutional
purposes.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
i
think
if
he
is
--
if
there's
evidence
that
his
presence
in
society
as
any
other
person
that
as
a
parolee
would
be
dangerous
to
society
that
he
--
i
do
not
object
to
his
incarceration.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
no,
i
--
i
--
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make,
your
honor,
is
that
if
this
person
was
a
dangerous
person,
i
--
i
think
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
--
that
he
should
be
incarcerated
pending
the
--
if
there's
probable
cause
to
believe
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
no,
i
don't
--
i
really
don't
think
that's
important.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
well
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
i
think
that
the
hearing
should
be
held
within
a
short
time.
i'm
talking
about
a
week
or
so
and
--
and
i
--
in
--
in
iowa
only
because
the
penitentiary
is
way
off
down
one
corner
of
the
state.
i
think
transporting
a
prisoner
back
and
forth
may
not
be
necessary
and
--
and
holding
him
in
the
county
jail
for
a
period
of
week
or
so
particularly
so
he
can
talk
to
counsel
if
he
has
some
--
so
he
can
make
preparations
for
the
hearing
would
be
appropriate
to
the
case,
and
i
don't
think
that
it
would
be
necessary
to
return
him
to
prison.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
i
think
that
once
it
is
determined
that
a
petitioner
is
entitled
to
a
hearing,
prior
to
revocation
of
his
parole
and
considering
the
--
the
substantial
interest
he
has
in
his
continued
liberty,
that
there
is
authority
for
this
court
to
hold
that
he
is
entitled
to
counsel
at
such
a
hearing.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
the
issues
in
this
case
are
--
are,
by
the
record,
limited
to
the
right
to
hearing
and
do
not
include
the
question
of
the
right
to
counsel.
however,
i
do
believe
that
if
this
court
feels
that
the
constitution
does
require
a
hearing
prior
to
revocation
of
parole
that
due
to
the
serious
nature
of
the
consequences
to
a
parolee
should
his
parole
be
revoked
without
a
hearing
and
in
that,
in
compliance
with
the
constitution
that
there
is
sufficient
authority
for
this
court
to
also
hold
that
he
should
be
entitled
to
appoint
a
counsel
should
he
not?
she
--
he
should
be
entitled
at
least
to
have
retained
counsel
present.
that's
--
that,
however,
goes
to
the
kind
of
hearing
that's
required.
and
i
think
it's
first
and
most
important
for
the
court
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
hearing
is
required.
and
of
course,
it's
our
contention
that
it
is.
and
--
and
in
contending
that
a
hearing
is
required,
we
rely
principally
upon
that
line
of
cases
of
--
of
this
court
which
have
held
due
process
of
law
requires
a
hearing
and
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
whenever
important
rights
are
substantially
affected
by
state
action.
and
these
cases
i'm
talking
about
are
cases
like
goldberg
versus
kelly,
bell
versus
burson,
groppi
versus
leslie
and
greene
versus
mcelroy.
these
cases
all
held
that
a
hearing
and
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
are
required
prior
to
the
termination
by
state
action
of
various
types
of
rights
or
privileges
enjoyed
by
these
individuals.
and
the
types
of
rights
that
were
involved
in
those
cases
are
not
being
disqualified
for
unemployment
compensation,
an
individual's
interest
in
continued
welfare
benefits,
an
individual's
interest
in
not
having
his
name
arbitrarily
posted
on
a
pubic
list
of
excessive
drinkers,
an
individual's
interest
in
not
being
held
in
contempt
of
the
state
legislature
and
an
individual's
interest
in
uninsured
motorist's
interest,
in
not
having
his
driver's
license
suspended
after
an
accident.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
no,
i
would
not,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
it
does
--
i'm
--
you're
correct
that
it
does
affect
his
interest.
however,
i
think
that
what
is
most
important
in
that
situation
is
that
the
board
of
parole
in
sitting
on
determining
whether
or
not
to
release
a
person
on
parole
is
guided
only
by
considerations
in
its
expertise
in
--
in
examining
the
conduct
of
the
prisoner
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
feel
that
he
is
a
good
risk
for
parole
and
should
be
permitted
to
go
outside
of
the
walls
of
the
prison
and
attempt
to
--
to
continue
his
rehabilitation
which
they
believe
is
--
to
some
extent
at
that
point
on
the
outside
of
the
prison.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
after
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
i
suppose
an
argument
can
be
made
that
if
the
board
of
parole
denies
a
parole
when
considering
whether
or
not
to
--
to
give
a
parole,
denies
it
on
the
basis
of
allegations
of
fact
concerning
his
conduct
an
argument
could
be
made
that
he
should
be
entitled
to
appear
before
the
board
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
as
a
matter
of
practise,
most
--
as
i
understand,
most
prisoners
at
the
time
they
are
being
considered
for
parole
do
appear
before
a
board.
i
think
an
argument
could
be
made
that
he
should
be
entitled
to
some
hearing
at
that
time
but
i'm
not
making
that
argument
and
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
it's
critical
to
this
case
because
what
we're
talking
about
is
a
parolee
--
a
person
whom
the
board
of
parole
has
decided
is
worthy
of
this
conditional
liberty
of
parole
and
being
permitted
to
go
back
out
and
deciding
an
attempt
to
make
a
full
community
and
family
life,
to
contribute
to
the
society,
talking
about
revocation
of
that
status,
which
has
previously
been
granted
by
the
board
of
parole.
and
i
think
there
is
a
valid
distinction
now.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
that
is
the
report
with
respect
to
petitioner
morrissey
and
the
report
with
respect
to
petitioner
booher
is
at
page
106,
i
believe.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
now,
this
record
doesn't
even
show
that
there
was
such
a
hearing,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
nothing
in
the
record
in
the
district
court,
the
court
of
appeals
or
in
this
case
concerning
that
alleged
hearing.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
--
that
the
board
of
parole
should
after
his
admission
that
he
in
fact
purchased
an
automobile
under
assumed
name,
i
think
the
court
should
hear
from
him
his
explanation
whatever
reasons
that
there
may
be
in
mitigation.
i
can't
think
of
what
they
would
be
at
this
point
for
--
why
a
person
would
do
that
except
maybe
to
avoid
violation
of
a
specific
term
of
the
--
of
the
parole
agreement.
but
i
do
think
that
that
conduct
constitutes
a
violation
of
the
spirit
of
it,
if
not
the
technical
terms
of
it.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
i
think
that
that
--
that
the
hearing
relates
to
that
part.
most
importantly,
i
--
i
would
not
concede
that
--
that
presence
of
the
parolee
at
the
time
the
board
may
be
making
that
second
decision
may
not
be
of
assistance
to
the
board,
but
i
think
that,
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
a
right
to
hearing
on
the
determination
of
the
fact
of
violation
is
what
we're
talking
about
in
this
case.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
i
believe
that's
correct
that
the
hearing
could
be
terminated
once
the
board
of
parole
has
heard
from
the
parolee.
he
has
either
admitted
or
denied
the
violations.
if
he
has
admitted
he
may
offered
some
extenuating
circumstances
or
other
facts
in
mitigation.
at
that
point,
i
believe
it
would
be
proper
for
the
board
of
parole
to
adjourn
the
hearing
to
consider
and
deliberate
in
private
with
respect
to
what
action
should
be
taken
once
the
facts
have
been
established.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
i
believe
that
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
in
fact
in
this
case,
the
reported
violation
with
respect
to
petitioner
booher
shows
that
his
parole
agent
was
out
of
the
state
for
--
on
vacation
during
the
period
of
time
the
alleged
violations
occurred.
so
he
did
not
know
about
them
first
hand
anyway
that
he
was
accused
of
leaving
the
county
to
which
he
was
assigned
and
that
the
violation
shows
that
--
that
there
are
two
possible
reasons
for
leaving
the
county.
one
was
his
wife
was
--
went
to
iowa
city,
iowa
in
another
county
to
have
a
baby.
the
other
reason
was
that
he
was
--
he
was
having
trouble
keeping
himself
employed
and
he
left
the
county
to
work.
now,
one
of
the
conditions
of
parole
is
that
he
keep
himself
employed
and
another
one
is
that
he
not
leave
the
county.
his
parole
agent
was
out
of
the
state
and
he
left
the
county
to
work.
i
believe
that
circumstances
like
these
could
be
shown
at
a
hearing.
the
parole
agent
--
i
--
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
saying
here,
your
honor,
that
parole
agents
are
dirty
guys
and
we
shouldn't
believe
them
but
i'm
saying
that
there
are
circumstances
that
exist
that
were
biased
or
prejudiced
or
even
honest
misinformation
lead
to
the
parole
revocations
without
a
hearing,
and
i
believe
that
due
process
requires
that
before
a
parolee
is
--
has
his
condition
of
liberty
terminated,
he
is
sent
back
to
the
prison
for
five
to
seven
additional
years
that
he
is
entitled
to
a
hearing
to
establish
the
fact
that
the
parole
violation
before
the
board
goes
any
further
to
determine
whether
or
not
his
parole
should
be
terminated.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
and
to
argue
mitigating
circumstances
in
the
event
that
he
does
admit
the
fact.
take
the
situation
of
booher
leaving
the
county
to
find
--
to
--
to
work.
he
is
--
he's
in
the
heart
of
this
dilemma.
if
he
--
if
he
has
a
job
offer
outside
of
the
county,
he'll
be
violating
his
parole
agreement.
if
he
doesn't
take
it,
he'll
be
violating
the
parole
agreement
if
he
goes
out
of
the
county
to
work.
i
think
circumstances
like
these
particularly
when
the
--
when
the
revocation
is
based
on
what
we
may
call
technical
violations
that
parolee
is
entitled
to
a
hearing
to
establish
the
fact
of
violation.
if
the
parolee
is
charged
with
an
act
that
constitutes
a
crime
of
an
armed
robbery,
a
burglary
or
something
like
that,
the
criminal
process
comes
into
play.
he
can
be
arrested
for
a
violation
of
that
crime
and
once
he
is
convicted
of
that
crime,
he's
going
to
be
in
custody
probably
while
that
crime
is
being
considered.
once
he's
been
convicted
of
that
crime
i
have
no
objection
to
his
--
to
the
revocation
of
his
parole
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
--
based
upon
that
conviction.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
well
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
--
in
that
--
i
believe
you're
correct,
your
honor.
the
--
the
contrary
is
probably
if
he
is
charged
with
a
--
with
a
separate
crime
and
in
the
criminal
process,
he
probably
will
be
on
bail
during
that
time.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
they
may
--
they
are
certainly
not
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
i
think
that
in
booher's
case
in
this
respect
is
on
the
facts
of
the
violations
is
much
better
than
morrissey's
case.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
it's
a
matter
of
saying
that
there's
only
one
in
county.
and
actually
the
parole
agreement
if
you'll
examine,
it
requires
when
he
--
he
obtains
permission
to
do
something.
the
parole
agreement
says
he
has
to
obtain
permission
from
the
chief
parole
officer
which
is
in
--
they're
more
in
the
capital
of
the
state.
i
assume
that
when
the
parole
agent
is
on
gone
from
the
county
that
then
the
chief
parole
officer
in
des
moines
is
the
person
that
has
the
immediate
supervision
of
that
parolee.
it's
a
matter
of
saying
that
there's
no
other
agent
in
the
county
which
will
handle
it
at
time.
there
may
be
in
des
moines
and
some
of
the
other
larger
cities
of
the
state
more
than
one
parole
agent,
but
in
the
small
county
that
booher
was
from,
i'm
quite
confident,
there
would
be
not
more
than
one
agent
there.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
i
don't
--
i
can't
think
of
it,
your
honor.
it's
o'brien
county
except
in
the
northwest
part
of
the
state.
i
can't
tell
you
that
(inaudible)
right
now.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
you
know,
your
honor,
we
have
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
--
not
made
that
argument
here.
i
do
think
that
--
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
i
think
that
a
very
good
argument
could
be
made
that
--
that
this
--
this
type
of
thing
they're
talking
about
is
another
reason
why
a
hearing
may
be
--
may
be
critical
prior
to
revocation
of
this
parole.
but
we
are
not
making
the
argument
that
the
parole
agreement
should
held
beyond
constitutional
for
vagueness.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
no,
i
--
i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
an
argument
while
it'
s
also
not
germane
to
this
case,
an
argument
could
be
made
at
them.
parole
agreements
are
unfair
in
--
in
extending
some
conditions
that
should
not
be
extended
but
that
--
that
again
is
not
a
part
of
this
case.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
w.
don
brittin,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
