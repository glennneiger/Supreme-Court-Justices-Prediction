mr.
brittin,
in
your
brief,
you
point
out
that
a
parole
hearing
has
a
two-fold
function,
the
first
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
it
was
a
violation
and
the
second
to
determine
what
to
be
done.
as
i
read
your
brief,
you
take
the
position
that
the
hearing
relates
to
the
first
aspect
of
that
only.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
the
hearing
to
be
terminated
at
that
point
