that
statement
at

with
respect
to
morrissey
appears
on

of
the
appendix,
does
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
what
you're
talking
about?
is
there
a
copy
of
the
parole
agreement?
justice
potter
stewart
page
100?
and
is
it
a
standard
parole
agreement
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
both
of
these
petitioners
signed?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
is
the
--
presumably
what
each
one
of
these
petitioners
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
signed
and
then
i
suppose
with
respect
to
individual
parolees
that
other
conditions
maybe
added
that
are

been
all
about.
justice
potter
stewart
record
that
he's
talking
about.
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
--
justice
potter
stewart
all
we
know
about
that
comes
from
your
brother's
brief
on
the
other
side.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
about
any
such
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
--
there
is
an
overlap
which
you
suggest,
however,
is
it
there,
because
the
--
you
could
show
that
the
--
well,
for
example,
one
of
the
conditions
of
the
parole
agreement
was
that
these
petitioners
not
leave
the
county.
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
you
can
show
in
a
factual
hearing,
yes,
he
did
leave
the
county
but
do
--
you
could
further
show
that
he
left
because
his
mother
was
dying,
and
he
tried
to
reach
his
parole
officer
and
it
was
a
weekend
and
he
couldn't
reach
his
parole
officer
so
in
that
emergency
he
left
and
he
returned
promptly
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
would
show
a
fact
--
that
would
show
a
violation
of
the
parole
but
the
--
it
would
also
show
mitigating
circumstances
that
would
presumably
affect
the
parole
board's
decision
upon
whether
or
not
to
revoke
the
parole,
does
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
you're
not
making
any
claim
in
this
case
that
the
parole
agreement
itself
is
so
impossibly
vague
as
to
not
really
said
any
ascertainable
standards,
are
you?
justice
potter
stewart
referring
to
paragraph
6
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
will
avoid
questionable
associates,
keep
reasonable
hours,
avoid
all
places
of
questionable
reputation,
it
would
be
pretty
--
that'd
be
rather
subjective
as
to
whether
or
not
he
violated
those
provisions
or
not.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that's
internally
inconsistent,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
used
the
word
"said"
at
least.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
goes
by
mail
individually
to
each,
the
three
members
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
the
board
who
live
in
various
parts
of
the
state
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
--
they
note
it
together
and
confer.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
all
of
these
you've
learned,
what?
since
certiorari
was
granted
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
in
your
conversations
with
mr.
badel?
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
prisons
are
there
in
the
state?
justice
potter
stewart
prisons.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
they
have
jails.
i'm
talking
about
--
justice
potter
stewart
three.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
my
question.
justice
potter
stewart
three
where
the
board
of
parole
visits.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
there
is,
as
you
say,
a
jail
in
each
county
or
almost
in
every
county.
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
counties
are
there?
justice
potter
stewart
99.
justice
potter
stewart
even
exposed.
justice
potter
stewart
as
far
as
you
know,
they
weren't
known
to
counsel
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
isn't
there
--
isn't
there
a
great
deal
of
difference
including
a
psychological
difference
and
--
when
alone
and
perhaps
a
burden
of
proof
difference
as
to
whether
or
not
the
hearing
is
held
prior
to
the
decision
of
the
parole
board
to
revoke
parole
as
contrasted
with
the
hearing
after
that
fate,
i
call
plea,
after
the
board
has
decided
to
revoke
parole,
then
there's
a
very
great
burden,
is
there
not,
on
the
parolee
to
--
to
convince
the
board
to
undo
what
it's
done?
i'm
thinking
of
cases
like
armstrong
against
manzo.
you
may
be
familiar
with.
and
there
are
many
others
that
emphasize
the
importance
of
a
prior
hearing
before
the
decision
is
made.
justice
potter
stewart
and
how
about
burden
of
proof?
i
suppose
they
had
no
formal
principles
that
have
been
worked
out
in
parole
revocation
as
to
burden
of
proof,
has
--
has
there
been?
justice
potter
stewart
the
probabilities
are
there
wouldn't
be
a
recommendation
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
(voice
overlap)
probably
told
us.
justice
potter
stewart
we're
--
we're
now
however
talking
about
situation
where
there
is
a
recommendation
by
the
parole
officer.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
what
mr.
badel
told
you?
justice
potter
stewart
i
--
i
glanced
through
this
appendix
to
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
here
that
indicates
about
30
out
of
the
50
states
had
some
form
of
hearings.
is
that
--
have
i
counted
correctly?
justice
potter
stewart
but
do
you
know
how
many
happened
before
revocation?
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
your
state
in
iowa.
justice
potter
stewart
bearing
out
what
you've
learned
in
--
in
your
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
thought
it's
down
under
247.9
of
your
code
which
makes
a
parolee
subject
to
anytime
to
be
taken
into
custody.
