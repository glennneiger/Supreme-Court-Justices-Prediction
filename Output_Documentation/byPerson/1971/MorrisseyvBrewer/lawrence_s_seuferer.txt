mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
i
should
begin
in
the
light
of
some
of
the
questions
that
have
brought
out
a
lot
of
the
factual
circumstances
of
this
case
by
making
a
couple
of
points
concerning
the
factual
aspects
of
--
of
the
case
with
regard
to
the
hearings.
we
also
did
not
realize
that
there
were
hearings
in
this
case
when
--
when
i
came
into
it
at
any
rate.
and
had
this
--
the
posture
of
the
question
which
is
presently
before
this
court
been
somewhat
different
at
the
district
court
level,
we
undoubtably
would
have
had
an
evidentiary
hearing
there
where
all
of
the
stuff
would
have
been
brought
out.
as
it
was,
we
did
not.
there
is
an
indication
in
the
record
in
the
appendix
at
page
56
that
petitioner
morrissey
in
fact
received
a
hearing
before
the
state
board
of
parole.
it's
in
the
first
paragraph
on
page
56.
he
denies
he
received
a
revocation
hearing.
in
the
context
of
the
rest
of
the
petition,
i
think
the
--
the
inference
is
clear
that
that
was
before
arrest
or
before
revocation.
and
then
he
suggests
that
he
was
denied
counsel
to
represent
him
at
said
hearing
that
was
conducted
behind
closed
doors
by
the
state
board
of
parole.
it
was
this
matter
that
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
it's
--
it
appears
that
it
is,
your
honor.
and
i
think
this
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
yes,
i
--
i
believe
that
on
its
face,
it
does
appear
inconsistent.
it's
only
at
the
entire
petition
which
was
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
filed
in
lee
county
district
court.
if
the
entire
petition
is
read,
it
appears
that
his
--
he's
saying,
“i
didn't
receive
a
revocation
hearing
before
my
parole
was
revoked.
and
i
was
denied
counsel
at
the
hearing.
i
did
receive
before
the
state
board
of
parole
behind
closed
doors.”
i
think
in
--
in
the
total
context.
it
was
this
that's
caused
us
to
really
bring
out
the
matters
of
--
of
the
other
hearing.
now,
it
is
possible
in
this
regard
to
submit
affidavits
of
the
state
board
of
parole
showing
that
both
of
these
petitioners,
in
fact,
received
some
sort
of
hearing
after
they
returned
to
the
penitentiary.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
it
is
not
--
it
is
not
a
statutory
requirement
that
they
received,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
it
is
--
it
is
not
statutory.
in
fact,
the
statutory
provisions
which
provide
for
the
authority
of
granting
and
revoking
paroles
do
not
cover
the
matter
of
a
hearing.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
the
practice
is,
as
we've
stated
in
our
brief,
is
to
provide
a
post-revocation
hearing.
in
other
words,
the
parole
is
revoked,
they're
sent
back
to
the
institution
from
whence
they
came.
and
within
no
longer
than
two
months,
the
board
of
parole
sits
at
the
various
institutions
around
the
state
and
conducts
these
hearings.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
i
think
what
happened
in
this
case
is
substantially
the
practice.
the
parole
officer
hears
of
a
violation
as
he
did
in
this
case
through
some
method.
he
investigates
it
to
some
extent.
he
confronts
the
parolee
with
it
as
he
did
in
this
case
and
gets
whatever
he
has
to
say
about
it.
he
writes
up
his
report,
submits
it
along
with
his
recommendations
to
the
board
of
parole
and
on
the
basis
of
this,
they
revoke
the
parole
or
do
not
revoke
the
parole.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
that
--
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
that's
correct.
they
may
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
no,
they
act
individually
on
this.
it's
my
understanding
that
there
are
--
there
may
be
some
instances
where
they
will
communicate
by
telephone
on
a
particular
case
but
the
normal
circumstances
are
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
your
honor
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
--
in
our
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
you're
--
you're
right,
your
honor.
the
--
the
attorney
member,
mr.
badel
of
the
board
of
parole
was
the
one
i
conducted
extensive
conversations
with
concerning
this
matter
once
it
came
to
my
attention.
and
he
indicated
that
only
three
times,
since
he's
been
on
the
board,
has
anyone
denied
the
alleged
violations.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
that's
right.
one
of
those
three
was
in
fact
released
after
further
investigation.
the
other
two,
they
affirmed
the
action
of
revocation
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
--
according
to
his
--
his
comments
to
me.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
in
fact,
your
honor,
since
the
appendix
was
prepared
in
this
case.
i
came
up
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
yes,
i
--
i
came
into
--
came
into
this
case
only
at
the
time
certiorari
was
granted.
i
was
not
familiar
with
it.
and
looking
through
the
appendix,
when
i
came
across
this
aspect
about
mr.
morrissey,
that
triggered
my
talking
to
this
individuals
and
that's
where
this
information
came
to
light.
i
think
it's
unfortunate
that
an
evidentiary
hearing
was
not
held
at
the
district
court
level
because
that
would
undoubtedly
have
brought
these
matters
out.
it
is
our
--
our
contention,
however,
that
the
question,
the
posture
of
the
question
in
this
case
is
that
a
hearing
was
not
granted
prior
to
revocation.
and
in
any
event
the
hearing
that
was
granted
was
most
certainly
after
the
initial
act
of
revocation.
there
is
a
reason,
a
reason
that
is
not
unfavorable
to
the
parolee
as
a
matter
of
fact
as
to
why
the
initial
revocation
takes
place
at
the
time
it
does.
section
of
the
iowa
code,
247.12,
which
is
--
is
set
out
early
in
petitioner's
brief,
indicates
that
a
parolee
is
not
credited
with
time
served
while
he's
on
parole,
this
is
against
his
original
sentence,
or
while
he
is
away
from
the
institution
if
his
parole
his
is
revoked.
what
this
means
is
that
if
an
individual,
petitioners
in
this
case,
for
instance,
sat
in
the
county
jail
or
the
local
jail
until
such
time
as
the
parole
board
could
make
arrangements
to
get
there
with
all
the
facilities
it
would
be
necessary
for
some
sort
of
hearing,
none
of
that
time
would
count
against
their
original
sentence.
what
the
initial
action
of
the
parole
board
does
is
it
provides
that
as
soon
as
revocation
takes
place,
they're
returned
to
the
institution
and
any
time
they
serve
subsequent
to
that
but
still
prior
to
any
hearing,
they
may
be
held
that
the
institution
is
credited
against
their
original
sentence.
this
is
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
under
the
--
under
--
the
way
the
procedure
actually
operates
it
probably
wouldn't
your
honor.
it
makes
a
difference
only
in
terms
of
--
well,
let
me
--
let
me
back
up
a
statement.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
that's
not
entirely
correct,
your
honor.
and
as
far
as
our
position
goes,
that
would
be
true
on
the
face
of
it.
however,
if
the
parole
was
not
revoked,
the
individual
would
not
be
sent
back
to
the
institution.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
before
--
before
he
gets
back
to
the
institution.
so
what
this
means
is
that
if
we
do
not
revoke
the
parole,
and
they
should
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
he
sits
in
the
jail
and
the
hearing
that
was
subsequently
conducted
would
have
to
be
conducted
in
--
all
over
the
state
wherever
a
county
jail
might
be
and
this
would
cause
a
considerable
burden
on
the
--
the
board
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
--
of
parole
and
its
administrative
facility.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
the
credit
would
not
count,
your
honor,
until
that
parole
is
revoked
according
to
the
statute
in
effect
in
the
state.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
do
you
mean
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
your
honor,
i
--
most
counties
have
a
prison.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
they
have
jails.
prisons,
there
are
only
three
institutions.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
yes.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
there
is
a
reformatory
--
well,
three
where
the
board
of
parole
sits.
and
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
but
normally
--
the
normal
situation
is
there's
one.
the
state
penitentiary
for
madison
is
the
--
the
one
that
most
of
the
cases
fall
within
because
that's
where
the
--
the
most
serious
offenders
are
sentenced
and
that's
naturally
where
the
parole
from.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
almost
in
every
county.
there's
about
number
for
county
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
99.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
so
it's
a
--
it's
an
administrative
thing
too
as
well
as
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
no,
your
honor.
none
of
these
things
were
--
were
covered
in
terms
of
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
again,
the
problem
of
this
--
the
problem
of
this
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
--
of
this
case
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
i
--
i
can
not
speak
for
oral
argument.
i
wasn't
there.
but
as
far
as
the
briefs,
the
briefs
that
were
filed,
i
don't
think
any
of
these
matters
were
--
were
covered.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
i
don't
think
they
were,
your
honor,
because
they
certainly--
the
counsel
that
--
that
handled
this
case
at
the
court
of
appeals
level
certainly
never
gave
me
any
indication
of
it.
so
i
presumed
it
had
known.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
not
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor.
i
--
i
don't
--
i
guess
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
--
it
could
well
be.
i
--
i'm
not
--
not
sure
whether
it
is
or
not.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
this
is
the
--
the
federal
court
in
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
--
in
the
southern
district.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
i'll
tell
you
what
might
be
indicated
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
okay.
the
--
the
record
that
would
indicate
a
hearing
was
held
in
this
case
would
be
a
record
held
by
the
parole
board.
at
any
rate
in
its
central
office
in
des
moines
may
not
--
may
well
not
be
a
part
of
the
--
of
the
total
prison
records.
additionally,
we
feel
that
the
--
the
question
in
this
case
being
a
prior
hearing
that
there
are
--
there
are
several
reasons
why
a
hearing
prior
to
revocation
are
not
--
is
not
--
not
necessary
and
not
advantageous.
one
of
the
things
is
the
aspect
of
detriment
to
the
parolee
we
do
not
feel
is
there.
obviously,
if
he's
taken
away
from
a
job,
if
he's
deprived
of
--
of
living
at
home
with
his
family
and
so
forth,
these
deprivations
are
going
to
be
there
whether
we
have
a
prior
hearing
or
not
under
the
system
as
it
works
and
almost
all
the
cases
because
the
--
the
parole
violations,
even
though
they
may
only
be
allegations
at
one
point,
in
most
cases,
are
sufficient
to
justify
the
issuing
of
a
warrant
and
picking
him
up
and
holding
--
holding
him
in
a
county
jail.
so
whether
he
really
sits
in
the
county
jail
or
the
penitentiary
seems
relatively
immaterial
in
terms
of
his
interest
in
remaining
on
his
conditional
liberty.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
your
honor,
i
think
if
the
situation
was
one
where
the
parolee
steadfastly
denied
the
allegations
alleged
that
that
psychological
difference
might
come
--
might
come
into
practice.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
no,
your
honor.
it's
--
as
a
--
as
a
practical
matter,
i
guess
it
has
really
proved
necessary
too
because
there
are
so
few
cases
where
--
where
anything
changes
or
so
few
cases
where
there
is
a
denial
of
the
offense.
and
in
fact,
in
these
two
cases
here
not
only
do
the
--
the
reports
of
violation
which
admittedly
the
comments
in
there
are
the
comments
of
the
parole
officer
as
taken
from
the
individual
parolee.
but
in
both
of
those
instances,
if
they
--
if
they
are
carefully
read,
the
--
the
rules
that
he
alleges
were
violated,
the
petitioners
admit
the
violation
of
those
rules.
and
i
think
the
significant
thing
about
it
is
nowhere
in
all
of
the
proceedings
of
this
case
including
at
this
level
have
they
ever
denied
commission
of
those
offenses.
have
they
ever
said,
“we
didn't
do
what
they
said
we
did.”
nowhere
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
your
honor,
i
think
that's
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
i
think,
your
honor,
that
there's
a
point
to
be
made
in
that
respect.
however,
i
think
there's
a
point
that
weighs
against
that
too.
and
that
you'll
notice
i
think
in
--
in
both
of
these
cases
and
in
the
majority
of
the
cases
a
parole
is
not
revoked
on
the
basis
of
one
alleged
violation.
in
other
words,
there
are
three
in
both
of
these
instances.
and
usually,
i
think
also
that
the
report
of
violations
indicates
there's
some
past
problem.
normally,
the
people
we're
talking
here,
the
parole
officers
and
the
board
of
parole,
are
interested
in
a
rehabilitative
process.
it's
--
it's
an
expensive
proposition
to
--
to
maintain
a
prisoner,
and
it's
not
as
expensive
to
maintain
a
parolee.
they're
interested
in
working
with
these
people
and
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
a
violation
means
it's
an
admission
of
failure,
really,
to
people
that
are
trained
to
help.
and
i
think
that
the
--
i
think
there
is
something
to
be
said
for
the
mitigating
circumstances
but
i
believe
this
is
a
discretionary
question
that
has
to
be
weighed
by
the
board
along
with
this
guy's
entire
past
history,
including
the
psychiatry
reports
they
have
from
the
institution
when
he
was
there,
his
performance
there,
everything
else.
and
i
think
in
the
--
in
the
sum
total
of
things
that
this
decision,
the
second
decision,
if
you
will,
as
to
whether
or
not
the
parole
should
be
revoked,
once
the
fact
of
violation
is
established,
is
such
a
discretionary
matter
and
such
involves
so
many
non-legal,
non-technical
type
considerations
that
it
would
serve
no
useful
purpose
to
have
a
factual
proof
on
some
of
these
things.
if
they
were
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
board
of
parole
at
any
rate,
in
other
words,
they
knew
about
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
his
--
i
believe
his
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
and
the
--
and
of
course
the
--
the
employment
aspect
too.
booher
had
several
problems
remaining
employed
apparently
due
to
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
--
to
temper.
and
--
so
there
were
--
the
really
--
the
only
--
the
mitigating
circumstances
go
primarily
to
the
leaving
of
the
county
or
the
place.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
the
--
the
parole
officer
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
--
is
--
is
the
one
who
--
who
initiates
the
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
--
warrant
for
arrest.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
he's
not
--
i
don't
think
the
pick-up
is
automatic.
i
think
in
the
case
of
--
in
fact,
the
petitioner
morrissey,
the
parole
officer
submitted
his
report
of
violation
on,
i
believe,
january
28,
1969.
the
parole
was
revoked
and
morrissey
was
in
fact
incarcerated
in
the
local
jail
on
the
arrest
warrant
on
the
31st
of
january
which
would
indicate
that
in
that
instance
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
with
the
board
of
parole
and
with
the
--
there
are
actually
about
five
copies
of
it.
one
goes
to
each
of
the
three
members
of
the
board
of
parole
and
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
--
the
state
office.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
the
procedure
then
is
that
the
board
of
parole
on
just
really
on
the
basis
of
the
information
contained
therein
and
on
any
past
records
of
the
individual
vote
individually
--
usually
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
normally,
it's
by
mail.
they
vote
by
mail
to
the
chief
parole
officer
who
is
located
in
the
--
in
des
moines
in
the
capital.
and
two
votes
out
of
the
three
trigger
the
issuance
of
a
revocation
order.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
well,
he
may
be
in
jail.
no
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
--
if
--
what
i'm
saying
is
in
morrissey's
case,
he
was
not.
in
booher's
case,
he
was
in
jail
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
him
being
in
jail?
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
once
the
parole
officer
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
--
parole
supervisor
has
information
of
alleged
violations,
he
may
have
a
warrant
issued
for
the
man's
arrest
and
hold
him
in
the
local
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
that
comes
through
the
local
authorities.
it's
approved
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
--
by
the
state
--
by
the
state
parole
officer
though.
in
other
words,
it's
a
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
the
parole
officer,
with
--
usually
it's
a
matter
of
informing
the
chief
parole
officer
in
des
moines
who
supervises
the
whole
operation
of
the
information
available
to
him
and
that
he
wished
a
warrant
issued
to
pick
up
petitioner
booher
because
he
was
in
the
process
of
filing
a
reported
violation
on
him
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
it's
a
--
it's
a
--
well,
no,
your
honor,
it's
--
it's
a
warrant
issued
by
the
local
authorities
but
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
yes,
yes,
which
picks
up
or
arrests
petitioner
booher
and
incarcerates
him
in
a
local
jail.
then
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
then
this
process
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
as
was
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
--
done
in
these
cases
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
--
yes,
that
is
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
your
honor,
i
--
i
hesitate
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
--
to
say
always
but
the
--
the
normal
practice
is
that's
what
they
do
unless
the
parolee
is
--
is
--
they're
unable
to
pick
him
up
because
in
some
cases
he,
of
course,
is
gone
from
the
state
and
in
that
case,
he
does
not.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
no,
they
do
not.
as
a
matter
--
they
just
do
not
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
well,
it
depends
on
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
yes.
well,
if
that's
--without
some
verification
that
--
that
he
in
fact
is
gone,
i
really
don't
know
what
the
parole
--
parole
board
would
do.
it's
unlikely
they
would
revoke
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
in
essence
that's
--
that
what
they
had
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
--
aside
from
whatever
past
records
they
have
with
them.
they
of
course
have
files
on
all
of
these
people.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
that's
not
correct,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
--
again
we're
talking
about
--
we're
talking
about
things
on
which
--
i
don't
have
the
exact
statistics
on
it,
but
in
the
discussions
with
mr.
badel,
it
was
his
indication
that
they
reject
one
of
these,
in
other
words,
turn
them
out
lose
depending
upon
their
judgment
call
in
terms
of
--
of
whether
he's
still
a
good
risk
to
remain
on
parole.
in
this
kind
of
situation
where
you
have
three
alleged
violations
all
admitted,
i
would
say
almost
always
they're
going
to
buy
that
recommendation.
if
you
have
one
allegation,
it
was
mr.
badel's
opinion
that
normally
if
it's
--
is
strictly
a
technical
one.
now,
in
other
words,
he
left
the
county
or
something
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
yes.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
yes.
now,
that
--
that's
the
type
of
thing.
if
that
was
the
only
violation,
the
probabilities
are
would
not
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
that's
right.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
the
probabilities
are
there
would
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
well,
as
--
it's
my
understanding
that
in
many
of
these
cases,
in
many
cases,
i
know
many
is
--
i
--
i
realize
i
--
i
can't
pin
this
down
statistically.
i'm
sure
we
could
more
closely
from
the
members
of
the
board
of
parole.
but
in
many
cases,
they
don't
accept
the
recommendation
to
answer
your
specific
question.
i
could
only
speculate
as
to
what
cases
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
yes,
that's
what
he
told
me.
that
was
--
that
was
verified
by
the
chief
parole
officer
who
--
who
was
right
next
door
to
me
and
i
wasn't
able
to
talk
to
him
anyway
in
a
daily
basis.
but
it's
my
understanding
they
do
not
accept
the
recommendation
in
every
case.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
i
think
--
i
think
there
might
even
be
more
than
that,
your
honor,
that
have
some
sort
of
hearing,
not
necessarily
provided
by
statute
or
by
case
decisions
in
the
state
but
by
practice
says.
it's
a
situation
in
iowa.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
that's
correct,
your
honor,
nor
necessarily
before
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
i
do
not
have
that
figure
available,
your
honor.
in
--
in
respect
to
the
--
what
you've
mentioned,
the
statistics
you've
mentioned
there
--
there
is
a
publication
that
will
--
i
understand
be
published
this
summer
by
the
national
counsel
of
crime
and
delinquency
which
is
called
the
"organization
of
parole
systems"
and
is
prepared
by
the
national
parole
institute.
and
they've
studied
or
not
studied
but
set
out
the
procedures
of
parole
operation,
both
granting
and
revocation
in
all
the
states,
all
or
attempted
to
in
all
50
states.
there's
a
section
in
there
on
the
state
of
iowa
which
indicates
--
i
looked
at
some
of
these
--
the
drafts
of
some
of
these
and
they're
not
terribly
specific
but
it
does
indicate
that
there
is
a
revocation
hearing
subsequent
to
the
parole
revocation
that
there's
a
hearing
subsequent
to
revocation
i
should
say.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
in
our
state,
yes.
that's
--
the
iowa
section
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
yes,
bearing
out
the
general
procedure
not
that
these
two
individuals
specifically
had
one.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
i
think
it's
--
it's
substantially
typical
in
terms
of
--
of
what
they've
covered.
it's
not
necessarily
in
terms
of
form,
and
in
a
lot
of
cases,
we
may
not
know
of
some
of
the
previous
violations
and
that
sort
of
information.
but
in
terms
of
--
of
setting
out
the
rules
violated,
setting
some
sort
of
summary
of
--
of
how
they
were
--
they
were
violated,
setting
out
something
about
the
parolee's
version
of
these
offenses
and
our
conclusion
and
recommendation.
that,
i
think,
is
substantially
what
the
bulk
of
them
cover.
as
far
as
this
information
about
previous
violations
and
parole
history
if
they
know
it,
if
they're
aware
of
it,
have
been
his
parole
officer
all
the
time,
they
generally
will
include
something
about
that
if
they
don't
which
we
may
not,
they
don't.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
your
honor
that's
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
no,
i
--
i'm
not
--
your
honor,
i'm
not
really
sure
who
issues
that
warrant.
it's
a
--
maybe
--
i'm
sure
it's
not,
in
most
instances,
a
judge.
some
sort
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
i
think
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
--
that
is
usually
the
situation.
but
it's
--
it's
on
the
basis
of
--
i
think
i
should
make
this
clear,
it's
on
the
basis
of
the
approval
really
by
the
state
chief
parole
officer
in
des
moines.
in
other
words,
the
--
the
local
judge
or
the
local
magistrate
is
not
in
nine
times
--
i'm
not
--
in
nine
times
out
a
hundred
are
going
to
refuse
to
issue
a
warrant.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
it's
a
procedure
thing.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
in
essence
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
thought
it's
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
if
your
question
is
would
that
be
administratively
possible
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
--
i
think
it
probably
would,
your
honor,
as
to
what
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
i
--
the
only
problem
that
comes
to
mind
on
that
kind
of
process
is
the
--
the
local
magistrate,
if
you
will,
is
the
--
is
going
to
be
considering
certainly
only
the
facts
that
he
has
before
him.
this
is
--
all
these
would
be
seem
in
--
in
the
case
of
where
there's
no
question
or
where
the
individual
is
admitted
the
violations,
this
would
seem
unnecessary,
unless
there's
some
question
of
voluntariness
of
that
admission.
and
at
least
insofar
as
the
cases
of
petitioners,
there's
never
been
any
allegation
that
they
were
in
anyway
coerced
into
--
in
anything
they
did.
administratively
possible,
i
think,
yes,
your
honor,
that
it
would
be.
we
would
then
in
--
in
summary
--
our
contention
is
that
petitioners
morrissey
and
booher
both
admitted
the
fact
to
parole
violation,
have
never
in
any
manner
denied
that
admission.
and
in
light
of
these
facts,
we
would
submit
that
regardless
of
what
may
be
nice
or
better
maybe
in
a
--
in
a
general
proposition,
the
two
petitioners
here
got
all
the
process
they
would
do,
and
we
respectfully
request
that
this
court
affirm
the
lower
court
decision.
thank
you.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
i
should
begin
in
the
light
of
some
of
the
questions
that
have
brought
out
a
lot
of
the
factual
circumstances
of
this
case
by
making
a
couple
of
points
concerning
the
factual
aspects
of
--
of
the
case
with
regard
to
the
hearings.
we
also
did
not
realize
that
there
were
hearings
in
this
case
when
--
when
i
came
into
it
at
any
rate.
and
had
this
--
the
posture
of
the
question
which
is
presently
before
this
court
been
somewhat
different
at
the
district
court
level,
we
undoubtably
would
have
had
an
evidentiary
hearing
there
where
all
of
the
stuff
would
have
been
brought
out.
as
it
was,
we
did
not.
there
is
an
indication
in
the
record
in
the
appendix
at
page
56
that
petitioner
morrissey
in
fact
received
a
hearing
before
the
state
board
of
parole.
it's
in
the
first
paragraph
on
page
56.
he
denies
he
received
a
revocation
hearing.
in
the
context
of
the
rest
of
the
petition,
i
think
the
--
the
inference
is
clear
that
that
was
before
arrest
or
before
revocation.
and
then
he
suggests
that
he
was
denied
counsel
to
represent
him
at
said
hearing
that
was
conducted
behind
closed
doors
by
the
state
board
of
parole.
it
was
this
matter
that
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
it's
--
it
appears
that
it
is,
your
honor.
and
i
think
this
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
yes,
i
--
i
believe
that
on
its
face,
it
does
appear
inconsistent.
it's
only
at
the
entire
petition
which
was
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
filed
in
lee
county
district
court.
if
the
entire
petition
is
read,
it
appears
that
his
--
he's
saying,
“i
didn't
receive
a
revocation
hearing
before
my
parole
was
revoked.
and
i
was
denied
counsel
at
the
hearing.
i
did
receive
before
the
state
board
of
parole
behind
closed
doors.”
i
think
in
--
in
the
total
context.
it
was
this
that's
caused
us
to
really
bring
out
the
matters
of
--
of
the
other
hearing.
now,
it
is
possible
in
this
regard
to
submit
affidavits
of
the
state
board
of
parole
showing
that
both
of
these
petitioners,
in
fact,
received
some
sort
of
hearing
after
they
returned
to
the
penitentiary.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
it
is
not
--
it
is
not
a
statutory
requirement
that
they
received,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
it
is
--
it
is
not
statutory.
in
fact,
the
statutory
provisions
which
provide
for
the
authority
of
granting
and
revoking
paroles
do
not
cover
the
matter
of
a
hearing.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
the
practice
is,
as
we've
stated
in
our
brief,
is
to
provide
a
post-revocation
hearing.
in
other
words,
the
parole
is
revoked,
they're
sent
back
to
the
institution
from
whence
they
came.
and
within
no
longer
than
two
months,
the
board
of
parole
sits
at
the
various
institutions
around
the
state
and
conducts
these
hearings.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
i
think
what
happened
in
this
case
is
substantially
the
practice.
the
parole
officer
hears
of
a
violation
as
he
did
in
this
case
through
some
method.
he
investigates
it
to
some
extent.
he
confronts
the
parolee
with
it
as
he
did
in
this
case
and
gets
whatever
he
has
to
say
about
it.
he
writes
up
his
report,
submits
it
along
with
his
recommendations
to
the
board
of
parole
and
on
the
basis
of
this,
they
revoke
the
parole
or
do
not
revoke
the
parole.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
that
--
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
that's
correct.
they
may
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
no,
they
act
individually
on
this.
it's
my
understanding
that
there
are
--
there
may
be
some
instances
where
they
will
communicate
by
telephone
on
a
particular
case
but
the
normal
circumstances
are
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
your
honor
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
--
in
our
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
you're
--
you're
right,
your
honor.
the
--
the
attorney
member,
mr.
badel
of
the
board
of
parole
was
the
one
i
conducted
extensive
conversations
with
concerning
this
matter
once
it
came
to
my
attention.
and
he
indicated
that
only
three
times,
since
he's
been
on
the
board,
has
anyone
denied
the
alleged
violations.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
that's
right.
one
of
those
three
was
in
fact
released
after
further
investigation.
the
other
two,
they
affirmed
the
action
of
revocation
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
--
according
to
his
--
his
comments
to
me.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
in
fact,
your
honor,
since
the
appendix
was
prepared
in
this
case.
i
came
up
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
yes,
i
--
i
came
into
--
came
into
this
case
only
at
the
time
certiorari
was
granted.
i
was
not
familiar
with
it.
and
looking
through
the
appendix,
when
i
came
across
this
aspect
about
mr.
morrissey,
that
triggered
my
talking
to
this
individuals
and
that's
where
this
information
came
to
light.
i
think
it's
unfortunate
that
an
evidentiary
hearing
was
not
held
at
the
district
court
level
because
that
would
undoubtedly
have
brought
these
matters
out.
it
is
our
--
our
contention,
however,
that
the
question,
the
posture
of
the
question
in
this
case
is
that
a
hearing
was
not
granted
prior
to
revocation.
and
in
any
event
the
hearing
that
was
granted
was
most
certainly
after
the
initial
act
of
revocation.
there
is
a
reason,
a
reason
that
is
not
unfavorable
to
the
parolee
as
a
matter
of
fact
as
to
why
the
initial
revocation
takes
place
at
the
time
it
does.
section
of
the
iowa
code,
247.12,
which
is
--
is
set
out
early
in
petitioner's
brief,
indicates
that
a
parolee
is
not
credited
with
time
served
while
he's
on
parole,
this
is
against
his
original
sentence,
or
while
he
is
away
from
the
institution
if
his
parole
his
is
revoked.
what
this
means
is
that
if
an
individual,
petitioners
in
this
case,
for
instance,
sat
in
the
county
jail
or
the
local
jail
until
such
time
as
the
parole
board
could
make
arrangements
to
get
there
with
all
the
facilities
it
would
be
necessary
for
some
sort
of
hearing,
none
of
that
time
would
count
against
their
original
sentence.
what
the
initial
action
of
the
parole
board
does
is
it
provides
that
as
soon
as
revocation
takes
place,
they're
returned
to
the
institution
and
any
time
they
serve
subsequent
to
that
but
still
prior
to
any
hearing,
they
may
be
held
that
the
institution
is
credited
against
their
original
sentence.
this
is
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
under
the
--
under
--
the
way
the
procedure
actually
operates
it
probably
wouldn't
your
honor.
it
makes
a
difference
only
in
terms
of
--
well,
let
me
--
let
me
back
up
a
statement.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
that's
not
entirely
correct,
your
honor.
and
as
far
as
our
position
goes,
that
would
be
true
on
the
face
of
it.
however,
if
the
parole
was
not
revoked,
the
individual
would
not
be
sent
back
to
the
institution.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
before
--
before
he
gets
back
to
the
institution.
so
what
this
means
is
that
if
we
do
not
revoke
the
parole,
and
they
should
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
he
sits
in
the
jail
and
the
hearing
that
was
subsequently
conducted
would
have
to
be
conducted
in
--
all
over
the
state
wherever
a
county
jail
might
be
and
this
would
cause
a
considerable
burden
on
the
--
the
board
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
--
of
parole
and
its
administrative
facility.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
the
credit
would
not
count,
your
honor,
until
that
parole
is
revoked
according
to
the
statute
in
effect
in
the
state.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
do
you
mean
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
your
honor,
i
--
most
counties
have
a
prison.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
they
have
jails.
prisons,
there
are
only
three
institutions.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
yes.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
there
is
a
reformatory
--
well,
three
where
the
board
of
parole
sits.
and
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
but
normally
--
the
normal
situation
is
there's
one.
the
state
penitentiary
for
madison
is
the
--
the
one
that
most
of
the
cases
fall
within
because
that's
where
the
--
the
most
serious
offenders
are
sentenced
and
that's
naturally
where
the
parole
from.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
almost
in
every
county.
there's
about
number
for
county
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
99.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
so
it's
a
--
it's
an
administrative
thing
too
as
well
as
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
no,
your
honor.
none
of
these
things
were
--
were
covered
in
terms
of
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
again,
the
problem
of
this
--
the
problem
of
this
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
--
of
this
case
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
i
--
i
can
not
speak
for
oral
argument.
i
wasn't
there.
but
as
far
as
the
briefs,
the
briefs
that
were
filed,
i
don't
think
any
of
these
matters
were
--
were
covered.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
i
don't
think
they
were,
your
honor,
because
they
certainly--
the
counsel
that
--
that
handled
this
case
at
the
court
of
appeals
level
certainly
never
gave
me
any
indication
of
it.
so
i
presumed
it
had
known.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
not
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor.
i
--
i
don't
--
i
guess
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
--
it
could
well
be.
i
--
i'm
not
--
not
sure
whether
it
is
or
not.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
this
is
the
--
the
federal
court
in
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
--
in
the
southern
district.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
i'll
tell
you
what
might
be
indicated
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
okay.
the
--
the
record
that
would
indicate
a
hearing
was
held
in
this
case
would
be
a
record
held
by
the
parole
board.
at
any
rate
in
its
central
office
in
des
moines
may
not
--
may
well
not
be
a
part
of
the
--
of
the
total
prison
records.
additionally,
we
feel
that
the
--
the
question
in
this
case
being
a
prior
hearing
that
there
are
--
there
are
several
reasons
why
a
hearing
prior
to
revocation
are
not
--
is
not
--
not
necessary
and
not
advantageous.
one
of
the
things
is
the
aspect
of
detriment
to
the
parolee
we
do
not
feel
is
there.
obviously,
if
he's
taken
away
from
a
job,
if
he's
deprived
of
--
of
living
at
home
with
his
family
and
so
forth,
these
deprivations
are
going
to
be
there
whether
we
have
a
prior
hearing
or
not
under
the
system
as
it
works
and
almost
all
the
cases
because
the
--
the
parole
violations,
even
though
they
may
only
be
allegations
at
one
point,
in
most
cases,
are
sufficient
to
justify
the
issuing
of
a
warrant
and
picking
him
up
and
holding
--
holding
him
in
a
county
jail.
so
whether
he
really
sits
in
the
county
jail
or
the
penitentiary
seems
relatively
immaterial
in
terms
of
his
interest
in
remaining
on
his
conditional
liberty.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
your
honor,
i
think
if
the
situation
was
one
where
the
parolee
steadfastly
denied
the
allegations
alleged
that
that
psychological
difference
might
come
--
might
come
into
practice.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
no,
your
honor.
it's
--
as
a
--
as
a
practical
matter,
i
guess
it
has
really
proved
necessary
too
because
there
are
so
few
cases
where
--
where
anything
changes
or
so
few
cases
where
there
is
a
denial
of
the
offense.
and
in
fact,
in
these
two
cases
here
not
only
do
the
--
the
reports
of
violation
which
admittedly
the
comments
in
there
are
the
comments
of
the
parole
officer
as
taken
from
the
individual
parolee.
but
in
both
of
those
instances,
if
they
--
if
they
are
carefully
read,
the
--
the
rules
that
he
alleges
were
violated,
the
petitioners
admit
the
violation
of
those
rules.
and
i
think
the
significant
thing
about
it
is
nowhere
in
all
of
the
proceedings
of
this
case
including
at
this
level
have
they
ever
denied
commission
of
those
offenses.
have
they
ever
said,
“we
didn't
do
what
they
said
we
did.”
nowhere
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
your
honor,
i
think
that's
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
i
think,
your
honor,
that
there's
a
point
to
be
made
in
that
respect.
however,
i
think
there's
a
point
that
weighs
against
that
too.
and
that
you'll
notice
i
think
in
--
in
both
of
these
cases
and
in
the
majority
of
the
cases
a
parole
is
not
revoked
on
the
basis
of
one
alleged
violation.
in
other
words,
there
are
three
in
both
of
these
instances.
and
usually,
i
think
also
that
the
report
of
violations
indicates
there's
some
past
problem.
normally,
the
people
we're
talking
here,
the
parole
officers
and
the
board
of
parole,
are
interested
in
a
rehabilitative
process.
it's
--
it's
an
expensive
proposition
to
--
to
maintain
a
prisoner,
and
it's
not
as
expensive
to
maintain
a
parolee.
they're
interested
in
working
with
these
people
and
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
a
violation
means
it's
an
admission
of
failure,
really,
to
people
that
are
trained
to
help.
and
i
think
that
the
--
i
think
there
is
something
to
be
said
for
the
mitigating
circumstances
but
i
believe
this
is
a
discretionary
question
that
has
to
be
weighed
by
the
board
along
with
this
guy's
entire
past
history,
including
the
psychiatry
reports
they
have
from
the
institution
when
he
was
there,
his
performance
there,
everything
else.
and
i
think
in
the
--
in
the
sum
total
of
things
that
this
decision,
the
second
decision,
if
you
will,
as
to
whether
or
not
the
parole
should
be
revoked,
once
the
fact
of
violation
is
established,
is
such
a
discretionary
matter
and
such
involves
so
many
non-legal,
non-technical
type
considerations
that
it
would
serve
no
useful
purpose
to
have
a
factual
proof
on
some
of
these
things.
if
they
were
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
board
of
parole
at
any
rate,
in
other
words,
they
knew
about
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
his
--
i
believe
his
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
and
the
--
and
of
course
the
--
the
employment
aspect
too.
booher
had
several
problems
remaining
employed
apparently
due
to
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
--
to
temper.
and
--
so
there
were
--
the
really
--
the
only
--
the
mitigating
circumstances
go
primarily
to
the
leaving
of
the
county
or
the
place.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
the
--
the
parole
officer
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
--
is
--
is
the
one
who
--
who
initiates
the
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
--
warrant
for
arrest.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
he's
not
--
i
don't
think
the
pick-up
is
automatic.
i
think
in
the
case
of
--
in
fact,
the
petitioner
morrissey,
the
parole
officer
submitted
his
report
of
violation
on,
i
believe,
january
28,
1969.
the
parole
was
revoked
and
morrissey
was
in
fact
incarcerated
in
the
local
jail
on
the
arrest
warrant
on
the
31st
of
january
which
would
indicate
that
in
that
instance
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
with
the
board
of
parole
and
with
the
--
there
are
actually
about
five
copies
of
it.
one
goes
to
each
of
the
three
members
of
the
board
of
parole
and
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
--
the
state
office.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
the
procedure
then
is
that
the
board
of
parole
on
just
really
on
the
basis
of
the
information
contained
therein
and
on
any
past
records
of
the
individual
vote
individually
--
usually
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
normally,
it's
by
mail.
they
vote
by
mail
to
the
chief
parole
officer
who
is
located
in
the
--
in
des
moines
in
the
capital.
and
two
votes
out
of
the
three
trigger
the
issuance
of
a
revocation
order.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
well,
he
may
be
in
jail.
no
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
--
if
--
what
i'm
saying
is
in
morrissey's
case,
he
was
not.
in
booher's
case,
he
was
in
jail
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
him
being
in
jail?
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
once
the
parole
officer
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
--
parole
supervisor
has
information
of
alleged
violations,
he
may
have
a
warrant
issued
for
the
man's
arrest
and
hold
him
in
the
local
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
that
comes
through
the
local
authorities.
it's
approved
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
--
by
the
state
--
by
the
state
parole
officer
though.
in
other
words,
it's
a
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
the
parole
officer,
with
--
usually
it's
a
matter
of
informing
the
chief
parole
officer
in
des
moines
who
supervises
the
whole
operation
of
the
information
available
to
him
and
that
he
wished
a
warrant
issued
to
pick
up
petitioner
booher
because
he
was
in
the
process
of
filing
a
reported
violation
on
him
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
it's
a
--
it's
a
--
well,
no,
your
honor,
it's
--
it's
a
warrant
issued
by
the
local
authorities
but
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
yes,
yes,
which
picks
up
or
arrests
petitioner
booher
and
incarcerates
him
in
a
local
jail.
then
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
then
this
process
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
as
was
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
--
done
in
these
cases
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
--
yes,
that
is
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
your
honor,
i
--
i
hesitate
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
--
to
say
always
but
the
--
the
normal
practice
is
that's
what
they
do
unless
the
parolee
is
--
is
--
they're
unable
to
pick
him
up
because
in
some
cases
he,
of
course,
is
gone
from
the
state
and
in
that
case,
he
does
not.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
no,
they
do
not.
as
a
matter
--
they
just
do
not
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
well,
it
depends
on
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
yes.
well,
if
that's
--without
some
verification
that
--
that
he
in
fact
is
gone,
i
really
don't
know
what
the
parole
--
parole
board
would
do.
it's
unlikely
they
would
revoke
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
in
essence
that's
--
that
what
they
had
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
--
aside
from
whatever
past
records
they
have
with
them.
they
of
course
have
files
on
all
of
these
people.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
that's
not
correct,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
--
again
we're
talking
about
--
we're
talking
about
things
on
which
--
i
don't
have
the
exact
statistics
on
it,
but
in
the
discussions
with
mr.
badel,
it
was
his
indication
that
they
reject
one
of
these,
in
other
words,
turn
them
out
lose
depending
upon
their
judgment
call
in
terms
of
--
of
whether
he's
still
a
good
risk
to
remain
on
parole.
in
this
kind
of
situation
where
you
have
three
alleged
violations
all
admitted,
i
would
say
almost
always
they're
going
to
buy
that
recommendation.
if
you
have
one
allegation,
it
was
mr.
badel's
opinion
that
normally
if
it's
--
is
strictly
a
technical
one.
now,
in
other
words,
he
left
the
county
or
something
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
yes.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
yes.
now,
that
--
that's
the
type
of
thing.
if
that
was
the
only
violation,
the
probabilities
are
would
not
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
that's
right.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
the
probabilities
are
there
would
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
well,
as
--
it's
my
understanding
that
in
many
of
these
cases,
in
many
cases,
i
know
many
is
--
i
--
i
realize
i
--
i
can't
pin
this
down
statistically.
i'm
sure
we
could
more
closely
from
the
members
of
the
board
of
parole.
but
in
many
cases,
they
don't
accept
the
recommendation
to
answer
your
specific
question.
i
could
only
speculate
as
to
what
cases
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
yes,
that's
what
he
told
me.
that
was
--
that
was
verified
by
the
chief
parole
officer
who
--
who
was
right
next
door
to
me
and
i
wasn't
able
to
talk
to
him
anyway
in
a
daily
basis.
but
it's
my
understanding
they
do
not
accept
the
recommendation
in
every
case.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
i
think
--
i
think
there
might
even
be
more
than
that,
your
honor,
that
have
some
sort
of
hearing,
not
necessarily
provided
by
statute
or
by
case
decisions
in
the
state
but
by
practice
says.
it's
a
situation
in
iowa.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
that's
correct,
your
honor,
nor
necessarily
before
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
i
do
not
have
that
figure
available,
your
honor.
in
--
in
respect
to
the
--
what
you've
mentioned,
the
statistics
you've
mentioned
there
--
there
is
a
publication
that
will
--
i
understand
be
published
this
summer
by
the
national
counsel
of
crime
and
delinquency
which
is
called
the
"organization
of
parole
systems"
and
is
prepared
by
the
national
parole
institute.
and
they've
studied
or
not
studied
but
set
out
the
procedures
of
parole
operation,
both
granting
and
revocation
in
all
the
states,
all
or
attempted
to
in
all
50
states.
there's
a
section
in
there
on
the
state
of
iowa
which
indicates
--
i
looked
at
some
of
these
--
the
drafts
of
some
of
these
and
they're
not
terribly
specific
but
it
does
indicate
that
there
is
a
revocation
hearing
subsequent
to
the
parole
revocation
that
there's
a
hearing
subsequent
to
revocation
i
should
say.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
in
our
state,
yes.
that's
--
the
iowa
section
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
yes,
bearing
out
the
general
procedure
not
that
these
two
individuals
specifically
had
one.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
i
think
it's
--
it's
substantially
typical
in
terms
of
--
of
what
they've
covered.
it's
not
necessarily
in
terms
of
form,
and
in
a
lot
of
cases,
we
may
not
know
of
some
of
the
previous
violations
and
that
sort
of
information.
but
in
terms
of
--
of
setting
out
the
rules
violated,
setting
some
sort
of
summary
of
--
of
how
they
were
--
they
were
violated,
setting
out
something
about
the
parolee's
version
of
these
offenses
and
our
conclusion
and
recommendation.
that,
i
think,
is
substantially
what
the
bulk
of
them
cover.
as
far
as
this
information
about
previous
violations
and
parole
history
if
they
know
it,
if
they're
aware
of
it,
have
been
his
parole
officer
all
the
time,
they
generally
will
include
something
about
that
if
they
don't
which
we
may
not,
they
don't.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
your
honor
that's
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
no,
i
--
i'm
not
--
your
honor,
i'm
not
really
sure
who
issues
that
warrant.
it's
a
--
maybe
--
i'm
sure
it's
not,
in
most
instances,
a
judge.
some
sort
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
i
think
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
--
that
is
usually
the
situation.
but
it's
--
it's
on
the
basis
of
--
i
think
i
should
make
this
clear,
it's
on
the
basis
of
the
approval
really
by
the
state
chief
parole
officer
in
des
moines.
in
other
words,
the
--
the
local
judge
or
the
local
magistrate
is
not
in
nine
times
--
i'm
not
--
in
nine
times
out
a
hundred
are
going
to
refuse
to
issue
a
warrant.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
it's
a
procedure
thing.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
in
essence
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
thought
it's
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
if
your
question
is
would
that
be
administratively
possible
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
--
i
think
it
probably
would,
your
honor,
as
to
what
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
s.
seuferer
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
i
--
the
only
problem
that
comes
to
mind
on
that
kind
of
process
is
the
--
the
local
magistrate,
if
you
will,
is
the
--
is
going
to
be
considering
certainly
only
the
facts
that
he
has
before
him.
this
is
--
all
these
would
be
seem
in
--
in
the
case
of
where
there's
no
question
or
where
the
individual
is
admitted
the
violations,
this
would
seem
unnecessary,
unless
there's
some
question
of
voluntariness
of
that
admission.
and
at
least
insofar
as
the
cases
of
petitioners,
there's
never
been
any
allegation
that
they
were
in
anyway
coerced
into
--
in
anything
they
did.
administratively
possible,
i
think,
yes,
your
honor,
that
it
would
be.
we
would
then
in
--
in
summary
--
our
contention
is
that
petitioners
morrissey
and
booher
both
admitted
the
fact
to
parole
violation,
have
never
in
any
manner
denied
that
admission.
and
in
light
of
these
facts,
we
would
submit
that
regardless
of
what
may
be
nice
or
better
maybe
in
a
--
in
a
general
proposition,
the
two
petitioners
here
got
all
the
process
they
would
do,
and
we
respectfully
request
that
this
court
affirm
the
lower
court
decision.
thank
you.
