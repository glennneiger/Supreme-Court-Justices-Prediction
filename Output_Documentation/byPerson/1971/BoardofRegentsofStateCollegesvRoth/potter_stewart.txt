justice
potter
stewart
you
are
calling
doctor,
is
he
a
ph.d?
justice
potter
stewart
and
where
is
he
now?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
in
terms
of
the
ultimate
outcome
of
this
case,
what
difference
would
be
--
answer
to
that
question
mainly?
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
that
--
it
was
another
case,
what
about
roth
case?
justice
potter
stewart
what
have
we
got
to
hear
for?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
am
trying
to
understand
the
significance
of
the
law
suit
but
in
the
case,
you
say
that
roth
has
already
what
reinstatement
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
couldn't
he
have
a
1983
action
be
predicated
on
the
denial
of
due
process?
justice
potter
stewart
with
this
court?
justice
potter
stewart
both
on
denial
of
first
amendment
rights
and
denial
of
due
process?
justice
potter
stewart
the
one
that's
here,
the
only
one
it's
here
is
the
denial
of
due
process.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
why
is
that
here
at
this
stage
if
that's
still
be
litigated
to
the
district
court?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right
and
then
that
should
affirm
in
the
seventh
circuit,
why
to
bring
it
here.
justice
potter
stewart
did
the
district
court
indicate
what
the
district
court
would
do
if
the
university
chose
not
to
give
him
a
hearing?
justice
potter
stewart
how
much
more?
justice
potter
stewart
does
the
court
do
that
in
an
ordinary
contract
case,
or
just
says
look
you
really
should
have
provided
and
since
you
didn't
provide
for
a
hearing
on
this,
let
us
say
this
tenancy,
year
to
year
tenancy,
we
are
now
going
to
require
one
--
the
court
does
--
justice
potter
stewart
why
is
there
something
in
--
required
here.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
is
your
--
i
don't
really
understand
your
position,
i
guess
that's
my
problem
is
all
about.
justice
potter
stewart
how
about,
court
examined
which
issue?
justice
potter
stewart
did
he
give
that
through
witnesses?
justice
potter
stewart
could
he
have
the
assistant
to
counsel?
justice
potter
stewart
subpeona
power?
justice
potter
stewart
discovery?
justice
potter
stewart
i
was
not
--
are
you
talking
about
a
full
due
process
here?
justice
potter
stewart
is
he
entitled
to
as
many
of
the
elements
of
due
process
that
we
held
in
goldberg,
the
welfare
recipient
is
entitled
to
it
before
welfare
benefits
maybe
terminated.
i
think
we
said
there
that
welfare
recipient
is
entitled
to
not
only
the
reasons
but
to
dwell
the
rights
to
his
testimony
to
contest
a
reason,
then
the
court
examine
anyone,
i
will
offer
them
to
have
the
assistant
in
the
counsel,
i
would
have
had
to
be
appointed,
to
be
entitled
to
(inaudible)
if
he
wanted
to.
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
any
partial
decision
like
there
was
a
dissent
--
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
a
written
statement
of
reasons
supporting
the
decisions
from
the
decision
maker?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
did
it
sound
to
me
that
what’s
different,
goldberg
case.
justice
potter
stewart
my
question
was
as
to
whether
or
not
the
type
of
hearing
you’re
saying,
due
process
requires,
in
this
situation,
the
same
type
of
hearing,
we
said
in
goldberg,
you
are
acts
just
seemed
to
me
which
are
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that's
only
assumption,
that's
all
like
tell
a
elevator
operator
to
look
for
a
job
as
a
mechanic,
and
not
to
tell
a
teacher
to
look
for
a
job
as
mechanic.
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
he
(voice
overlap)
first
amendment
claims,
reinstatement
or
damage?
justice
potter
stewart
you
are
calling
doctor,
is
he
a

is
