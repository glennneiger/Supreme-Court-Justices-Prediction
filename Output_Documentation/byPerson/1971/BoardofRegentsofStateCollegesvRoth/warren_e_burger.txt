chief

e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
number
71-162,
board
of
regents
of
state
colleges
against
roth.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
the
western
district
or
the
eastern
district?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
you’re
saying
that
should
have
gone
ahead
and
tried
the
case
from
the
district
court
right
away?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
tried
the
question
of
whether
he
should
have
been
hired
on
the
merits.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
is
nothing
in
whatever
to
do
with
teachers
as
in
the
class,
does
it?
wouldn't
it
justice
to
a
taxi-cab
driver,
a
bellhop
or
a
bookbinder--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
state
action
i'm
talking
about,
let's
make
it
more
sharply,
a
driver
for
some
state
official,
a
truck
driver.
if
he
frames
a
complaint
under
the
civil
rights
act,
under
1983,
that
justice
brennan
suggested
under
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
among
other
things,
he
must
have
a
hearing
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
can
make
this
proof.
are
you
saying
anymore
even
that,
when
you
call
this
a
concession?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
want
to
channel
in,
into
just
a
strictly
section
1983
action,
nothing
more?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
the
district
court
wouldn't
be
purporting
itself
to
try
out
the
issues
involved
in
his
discharge
--
on
non
renewal,
they
would
on
the
first
amendment
side,
but
they
would
not
be
purporting
to
try
out
whether
he
was
fired
for
incompetence
or
whether
it
was
incompetent.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
here
only
because
you
say
that
on
non-renewal
of
a
non-tenure
teacher,
you
don't
have
to
give
any
hearing
at
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then,
didn't
i
state
it
correctly
that
you
say
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution
that
requires
a
court
to
add
anything
to
the
contract
that
the
parties
made
in
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it
you
are
still
standing
on
your
basic
position.
and
i
am
a
non-tenure
teacher
whose
contract
is
not
renewed,
is
not
entitled
to
a
hearing
in
the
university
context
under
any
circumstances.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
steinglass.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
think
this
minimal
due
process
that
you
are
talking
about
mr.
steinglass
would
be
limited
to
the
faculty
members
or
would
it
include
the
elevator
operator
who
takes
the
faculty
members
up
to
the
upper
floors
of
the
building.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
assuming
they
aren't
covered
by
a
union
contract
after
all
the
tenure.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
understand
are
the
procedures
a
tenured
teacher
receives?
a
man
who
is
--
or
a
woman
who
has
six
years
or
more
--
isn’t
it
now
under
this
act.
but
that
six
years
they
have
tenure
and
they
receive
a
notice
that
decision
is
terminated.
what
kind
of
a
procedure
does
the
university
gives
that
person?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
essentially
like
the
hearing
that
judge
doyle
has
ordered
here
in
general
outline?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
we
went
in
to
the
basis
of
the
decision
that
the
mechanism,
the
machinery
of
reaching
that
decision
is
at
the
same
for
the
tenured
teacher
as
for
mr.
roth?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
he
didn't
define
what
minimal
was.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
suggesting
an
inconsistency
mr.
steinglass
in
the
position
of
non-renewal
and
keeping
them
for
the
balance
of
the
year?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
having
made
a
commitment
for
the
whole
year,
for
nine
months,
the
school
year,
are
you
suggesting
the
university
should
not
keep
it
if
they
can
possibly
do
it
consistent
with
the
welfare
of
the
university?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
it
reasonable
that
he
might
have
been
in
the
situation
that
he
wasn't
bad
enough
to
fire
but
not
good
enough
to
keep.
and
so
they
let
him
run
out
before
the
year
so
that
he
has
a
chance
between
february
1st
and
i
think,
your
friend
said,
and
when
he
receives
the
notice,
until
the
following
september
or
october
to
find
another
job.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
make
the
same
claim
for
a
person
who
had
not
been
hired
that
is
who
had
applied
and
who
was
not
hired,
as
you
make
for
a
person
who
is
not
rehired,
the
last
time
i
would
say
parenthetically,
the
last
two-three
questions
and
answers
had
all
talked
about
firing
somebody,
you
don't
claim
the
man
was
fired,
do
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
justice
teacher-qua-teacher
has
served
certain
first
amendment
values.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
steinglass.
thank
you
mr.
bleck.
the
case
is
submitted.
