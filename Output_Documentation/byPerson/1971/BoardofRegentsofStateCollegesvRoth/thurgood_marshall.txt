are
you
saying
to
the
court,
if
you
have
a
right
to
go
to
the
court,
you
don’t
have
to
have
administrative
hearing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
happens
with
the
tenure,
the
professor
with
tenure
--
is
he
have
the
hearing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
he
is
ultimately
saying,
trying
to
hear
him,
would
the
chief
justice
say
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
what
you
are
saying
is
he
has
no
resource.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
understood,
you
say
they
can
have
in
the
institution
and
whatever
he
gets
in
the
court
is
not
going
to
do
him
any
good.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
do
you
assume
that
at
the
district
court,
he
could
find
out
why
he
was
fired?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why?
because
you
said
under
the
contract,
you
are
not
supposed
to
give
those
reasons.
you
are
not
required
to.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
let
me
ask
you
this.
would
it
be
cheaper
for
the
university
to
give
him
a
hearing
in
the
university
that
just
defend
the
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
does
anybody
say
that
you
have
to
give
a
hearing
to
everyone?
justice
thurgood
marshall
not
in
every
case,
that's
where
it
is
requested.
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
requested.
justice
thurgood
marshall
right,
and
how
many
that
wouldn't
be
many?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
is
it
that
you
--
first,
i
heard
that
i
want
some
litigation,
but
trying
to
get
away
from
litigation.
justice
thurgood
marshall
will
the
burden
shift
to
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
hope,
it’s
a
probably
good
reason.
justice
thurgood
marshall
a
tenured
can’t
be
terminated
without
cause.
justice
thurgood
marshall
cause
has
to
be
shown.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
happens
if
the
hearing
on
non-tenure
professor,
he
says
why
without
filing
the
appointing
authority
or
discharging
authority
says,
i
don't
have
to
give
you
any
reason.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
just
what
i
am
talking.
who
makes
the
move
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
suppose
at
that
stage
the
university
says,
you
just
use
your
language,
somebody's
language,
you
just
don’t
cut
too
much.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
am
talking
about
just
their
behavior.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
would
hate
to
see
somebody
have
to
prove
that
he
is
an
efficient
professor.
