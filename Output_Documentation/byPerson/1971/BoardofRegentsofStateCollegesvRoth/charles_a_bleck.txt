mr.
charles
a.
bleck
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honor,
the
petitioners
in
this
case
are
the
board
of
regents
of
the
state
colleges,
they
are
now
known
as
the
board
of
regents
of
state
university
and
actually
to
be
absolutely
accurate,
they
are
now
known
as
the
board
of
regents
of
the
university
of
wisconsin
system.
the
other
petitioner
in
this
case,
is
the
president
of
the
wisconsin
state
university
at
oshkosh,
wisconsin.
the
respondent,
david
f.
roth
was
the
employee
of
the
board
of
regents
at
oshkosh
state
university
and
i
believe
the
enrollment
at
that
time
was
been
a
neighborhood
of
11,000
or
12,000
students.
doctor
roth
was
in
his
first
full-time
teaching
position.
he
was
hired
by
the
board
as
an
assistant
professor
for
the
academic
year,
1968-1969.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
yes,
sir,
he
is.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
your
honor,
i
would
--
i've
heard
but
i'd
--
much
rather
you
ask
the
other
side
because
i
would
mind
to
give
you
any
misinformation.
i
think
they
know
and
i
just
--
and
just
here
say
i
might
--
doctor
roth
was
hired
for
the
academic
year,
1968-1969.
he
was
hired
under
a
written
contract,
a
contract
that
had
a
fixed
term,
expressly
fixing
a
term
for
september
1,
1968
through
june
30,
1969.
the
contract
also
expressly
referred
to
section
37.31
of
the
wisconsin
statute
which
is
our
state
tenure
statute.
this
statute
at
that
time
provided
that
if
a
probationary
teacher
is
hired
for
four
consecutive
years,
he'll
acquire
tenure
or
permanent
status.
when
doctor
roth
was
hired,
there
was
a
board
rule
in
effect,
in
fact,
it
had
been
passed
on
march
10th,
1967,
which
provided
that
in
the
case
of
a
probationary
teacher,
no
reasons
will
be
given
for
non-renewal
and
there
will
be
no
hearing
provided
by
the
university
on
the
question
of
non-renewal.
this
same
rule
also
provided
that
in
each
case
of
non-renewal,
the
professor
or
the
employee
will
receive
notice
of
that
fact
by
february
1st.
so
in
effect,
he
has
from
february
1st
to
start
looking
for
a
new
position.
the
procedure
at
oshkosh
state
university
in
regard
to
renewal
or
non-renewal
of
the
probationary
contract
was
that
the
tenure
committee
of
the
particular
department
would
first
meet
and
vote
on
whether
to
recommend
retention
or
non-retention.
in
this
case,
it
was
the
tenure
committee
of
the
department
of
political
science.
that
recommendation
then
flows
up
to
the
dean,
who
also
makes
a
recommendation
and
from
there
it
flows
up
to
the
vice-president,
in-charge
of
academic
affairs,
and
then
to
the
president
for
his
decision.
in
this
particular
instance,
the
tenure
committee
met
and
voted
to
recommend
retention
of
doctor
roth
on
december
17th,
1968.
subsequently,
and
about
five
weeks
later,
dean
arthur
darkin
(ph)
approached
several
members
of
the
tenure
committee
and
asked
them
to
review
this
recommendation.
on
january
27th,
1969,
the
tenure
committee
did
meet
again,
did
review
their
previous
recommendation
and
at
this
time,
voted
for
non-retention.
this
recommendation
then
flowed
up
to
the
dean,
the
vice-president
and
to
the
president
who
made
his
decision
not
to
renew
doctor
roth's
contract
for
the
ensuing
academic
year.
this
notice
was
given
on
january
30,
1969.
doctor
roth
on
february
14th,
1969,
filed
his
complaint
in
the
district
court
seeking
declaratory
judgment
and
seeking
reinstatement
or
a
contract
for
the
ensuing
academic
year.
on
may
16th,
1969,
both
parties
moved
for
summary
judgment
and
on
march
12th,
1970,
the
district
court
granted
the
plaintiffs,
doctor
roth's
motion
in
part.
the
decision
of
the
district
court
held,
one,
that
either
the
state
university
would
have
to
give
doctor
roth
a
contract
for
the
next
academic
year
or
in
the
alternative
that
the
state
university
could
give
doctor
roth
a
written
notice
of
reason
for
non-renewal
and
a
hearing
on
those
reasons.
this
decision
was
appealed
to
the
seventh
circuit
which
affirmed
the
district
court
on
july
1st,
1971.
although
i
have
explained
the
fact
rather
extensively,
it
is
my
opinion,
your
honor,
that
the
fact
in
the
roth
case,
are
absolutely
irrelevant
at
this
time.
the
petitioners
are
not
here
to
defend
the
university's
action
and
not
renewing
professor
roth's
contract.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
no,
sir,
i
don't
believe
it
is,
but
the
board
of
regents
is
in
the
western
district.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
yes,
sir
it
was.
whether
the
university
acted
correctly
or
not
is
still
to
be
litigated
in
the
district
court.
the
present
posture
of
this
case,
does
not
involve
any
questions
of
the
first
amendment
rights
of
doctor
roth.
the
issue
is
basically,
it
is
whether
a
state
university
must
give
a
statement
of
reason
and
a
hearing
on
those
reasons
in
every
case
of
the
non-renewal
of
a
probationary
teacher's
contract.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
oh,
it
makes
a
tremendous
difference.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
in
roth
case,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
your
honor,
we
have
facing
a
--
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
well,
that
complaint
seeks
the
declaratory
judgment.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
no,
sir,
he
will
not
have
gotten
all
he
wants
because
the
defect
remain
that
he
wants
reinstatement
--
i
assume,
i
don't
know,
this
is
what
his
complaint
asks
for.
he
hasn't
changed
it
or
--
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
i
am
not
here
defending
his
non-renewal,
the
propriety
of
the
action
of
the
university
and
non-renewal
--
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
no,
sir,
i
do
not.
no,
sir,
that
facet
of
the
case
must
be
litigated.
to
repeat,
i
am
not
confessing
judgment
in
any
way,
your
honor,
but
because
of
my
personal
doubt
as
to
whether
the
university
acted
correctly
in
not
renewing
doctor
roth's
contract
for
the
ensuing
academic
year.
it
means
to
me
that
there
is
a
fundamental
error
or
wrong
in
the
decisions
below,
because
doctor
roth
made
the
allegation
in
his
complaint
that
his
contract
was
not
renewed
because
of
his
first
amendment
right.
now,
the
decision
below
requires
doctor
roth
to
go
to
this
administrative
agency,
and
to
have
a
hearing
before
the
administrative
agency
which
administrative
agency
is
the
alleged
wrong
doer
to
exhaust
this
remedy
before
he
can
proceed
in
the
district
court
to
determine
whether
his
fundamental
liberties
have
in
fact
been
violated.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
the
issue
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
was
whether
the
contract
was
not
renewed
for
impermissible
reasons
or
for
engaging
in
protected
constitutional
activity.
if
that
is
not
established,
then
the
non-renewal
would
stand.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
he
did
not
have
tenure,
he
was
a
one
year
probationary
teacher
on
his
first
year
of
teaching.
anyway,
in
answer
to
your
question
i
would
say,
no,
i
feel
that
if,
under
the
civil
rights
act,
professor
roth
would
always
be
able
to
come
in
to
the
district
court
and
frame
a
complaint
alleging
that
his
contract
had
not
been
renewed
because
of
his
protected
activity.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
no
sir,
i
am
not
saying
that.
what
i
am
--
the
basis
of
my
argument
is
that
in
administrative
hearing
before
an
agency
that
is
the
alleged
wrong
doer,
such
as
the
university,
or
this
university
can
conduct
their
hearing
on
its
own
motive
and
on
motives
that
might
possibly
involve
fundamental
liberties
just
doesn’t
seem
to
make
sense
to
me
your
honor,
i
think
the
proper
form.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
oh
yes,
we
are
required
to
give
him
a
hearing
by
law.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
no
sir,
it
wouldn’t
because
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
gave
the
probationary
teacher
a
hearing,
then
you
are
destroying
the
very
purpose
of
tenure.
you’re
appreciating
any
distinction
between
the
probationary
teacher
and
the
tenure
teacher.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
in
court
your
honor,
in
court.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
that's
our
only
complaint
your
honor,
yes
sir.
the
hearing
should
have
been
in
the
district
court.
these
facts
should
have
been
litigated
there
and
it’s
not
a
proper
subject
for
an
administrative
hearing
before
a
school
or
university.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
conceded
what
your
honor?
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
he
is
entitled
to
a
hearing
in
the
district
court
as
to
whether
his
fundamental
liberties
or
first
amendment
rights
have
been
violated.
i
do
not
concede
your
honor
that
he
is
entitled
to
a
hearing
in
the
district
court
on
any
other
ground
such
as
the
scholarship
or
competency
or
rapport
with
the
student
bodies.
these
items
are
not
for
the
district
court.
the
only
issue
for
the
district
court
seems
to
me
is
one
of
the
constitutional
rights.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
it's
right,
there
is
nothing
to
do
--
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
well,
that
would
be
true
for
any
governmental
employee.
it
wouldn't
be
necessarily
--
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
not
a
thing,
your
honor,
i
just
wanted
to
make
it
clear
to
the
court
that
the
issue
here
is
due
process
the
law
and
does
not
involve
first
amendment
rights
of
doctor
roth
at
this
time.
the
only
thing
is
due
process
of
law.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
the
due
process
question
is
not
to
be
litigated
in
the
district
court,
your
honor,
the
district
court
ordered
that
in
every
case,
that
they
have
already
decided
it,
they
ordered
that
to
give
him
a
hearing
and
that's
--
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
yes,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
issue
really
is,
is
whether
the
constitution
recognizes
a
state
system
of
statutory
opinion
or
the
maintenance
of
a
meaningful
system
of
tenure
under
state
law
by
creation
of
section
37.31
of
the
statutes,
the
wisconsin
legislature
has
recognized
the
importance
of
having
a
probationary
period
leading
up
to
the
acquisition
of
permanent
employee
status
or
tenure.
the
probationary
employees
as
well
as
the
university
has
a
tremendous
interest
in
maintaining
tenure.
the
district
court
decision
recognizes
and
felt
that
tenure
could
be
maintained
by
application
in
a
case-by-case
basis
of
minimal
ground
for
non-retention.
the
circuit
court
decision
also
recognizes
the
danger
to
the
tenure
system
back
every
brief
in
this
case.
it
seems
to
me,
it
recognizes
the
possibility
of
loss
of
tenure.
the
purposes
of
tenure
are
of
course,
academic
excellence
or
the
obtaining
of
the
best
possible
faculty
for
the
student
body.
tenure
also
affords
protection
for
the
faculty
and
is
absolutely
essential
to
the
maintenance
of
academic
freedom.
the
roth
decision
does
threaten
tenure,
because
it
vitiates
any
distinction
between
the
probationary
employee
and
the
tenured
employee.
this
danger
would
result
from
that
fact
that
these
universities
and
colleges
just
will
not
get
involved
in
administrative
hearings
of
this
sort
or
in
protracted
litigation.
they
will
do
everything
they
can
to
avoid
such
hearings,
including
the
keeping
of
an
incompetence
or
unscholarly
professors.
i
think
this
is
borne
out,
very
clearly
by
the
fact
that
we
had
so
few
discharge
proceedings
as
against
the
tenured
fact
and
so
few
discharged
proceedings
as
against
the
civil
service,
these
things
are
just
not
done
in
government.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
it
was
an
alternative
order
your
honor,
one
--
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
give
him
a
contract
or
give
him
a
hearing.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
i
don't
know
your
honor,
the
district
court
decision
said
that
in
recognizing
the
danger
of
losing
a
recognizable
system
of
tenure,
the
district
court
said
that
the
court
will
recognize
minimal
grounds
for
none
reappointment.
now,
what
he
meant
by
that,
i
don't
know
but
--
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
that's
right.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
no
sir,
it
was
not
--
what
happened,
it
was
an
alternative
order,
one,
give
him
a
contract
and
i
assume
if
we
don't
gave
him
a
contract
we
would
possibly
be
liable
for
damage.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
or
give
him
a
hearing
and
we
immediately
asked
for
a
stay
of
that
decision
or
order
and
immediately
appealed
to
the
circuit
court.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
he
did
not
indicate
other
than
to
say
he
would
respect
minimal
grounds
for
none
--
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
well,
then
we
would
have
to
give
him
a
contract,
we
didn't
give
him
a
contract,
we
would
be
in
contempt
of
court,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
or
a
reason.
dr.
roth
was
hired
with
this
clear
understanding,
this
does
not
come
in
shot
to
him,
this
was
part
of
his
agreement,
he
was
given
a
nine
month
contract
and
no
more.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
no
sir,
i
don't
maintain
that,
i
think
it's
a
great
deal
more
than
mere
contract
law.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
i
think
the
court
has
to
balance
the
interest
here.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
i
have
never
heard
of
that.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
well
i
don't
know,
your
honor,
it's
--
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
my
position
is
basically
this
that
due
process
of
law
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
require
the
procedural
protection
of
a
statement
of
reason
or
a
hearing.
that
due
process
of
law
just
does
not
require.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
yes
sir,
i
guess,
that's
correct.
i
think
in
weighing
the
interest
--
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
yes
sir,
that's
all.
i
can't
conceive
of
any
other
appropriate
issue
for
the
district
court.
now,
the
district
court
in
its
opinion
--
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
yes
sir,
for
very,
very
practical
reason
because
he
is
a
probationary
employee,
and
for
another
thing,
these
situations
are
very,
very
rare
your
honor
in
my
opinion,
and
if
somebody's
constitutional
rights
are
in
fact
infringed,
i
think
in
most
instances,
by
inadvertence
or
ignorance
of
the
constitution.
these
are
not
simple
question.
another
point,
i
don't
see
how
this
sort
of
procedure
that
is
suggested
in
roth
would
really
be
of
only
benefit
to
the
professor
or
would
be
of
any
benefit
to
the
court.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
no
sir,
he,
if
he
feels
that
his
--
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
no,
i
never
intended
to
imply
that
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
absolutely.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
but,
once
you
are
in
litigation
you
have
all
the
procedural
remedies
of
a
trial,
you
have
discovery.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
no
sir,
it
would
not
because
are
talking
about
hundreds
of
cases
of
non-renewal.f
we
are
not
talking
about
just
one
specific
direct
law.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
that's
what
the
district
court
ordered,
that
in
every
case
--
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
yes,
in
every
--
oh
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
in
every
case
where
requested.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
well
there
is
no
way
of
knowing
your
honor,
but
there
are
--
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
it
would
be
an
unnecessary
and
time
consuming
and
wasteful
procedure
to
put
not
only
the
school
truly
your
honor,
but
it
would
be
wasteful
for
the
professor
himself.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
well,
first
of
all
the
statement
of
reasons
--
i
don't
know
what
type
of
case
we
are
talking
about,
whether
we
are
talking
about
case
that
involves
first
amendment
claim
or
whether
we
are
talking
about
such
things
as
scholarship,
rapport
with
the
student
body
and
so
forth,
it
it
is
that
type
of
a
situation
where
these
things
are
very
difficult
to
articulate
and
these
decisions
are
made
up
by
many,
many
people,
this
isn't
the
decision
of
one
man,
but
this
is
the
decision
of
maybe
twelve
or
fifteen
people
and
to
have
a
hearing
on
whether
this
particular
professor
has
achieved
a
certain
level
of
scholarship.
i
can't
see
where
this
hearing
would
afford
anybody
any
benefit.
it
would
merely
polarize
the
party,
it
would
involve
the
entire
student
body
in
the
case
because
professor
would
call
his
students
and
say,
“well,
now
i
am
a
good
professor,
aren't
i?”
and
the
administration
would
call
students
and
so
forth
and
we
would
just
have
a
one
heck
of
a
mess.
these
things
just
don't
work
that
simply.
also
--
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
that's
it
precisely,
thank
you.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honor,
the
petitioners
in
this
case
are
the
board
of
regents
of
the
state
colleges,
they
are
now
known
as
the
board
of
regents
of
state
university
and
actually
to
be
absolutely
accurate,
they
are
now
known
as
the
board
of
regents
of
the
university
of
wisconsin
system.
the
other
petitioner
in
this
case,
is
the
president
of
the
wisconsin
state
university
at
oshkosh,
wisconsin.
the
respondent,
david
f.
roth
was
the
employee
of
the
board
of
regents
at
oshkosh
state
university
and
i
believe
the
enrollment
at
that
time
was
been
a
neighborhood
of
11,000
or
12,000
students.
doctor
roth
was
in
his
first
full-time
teaching
position.
he
was
hired
by
the
board
as
an
assistant
professor
for
the
academic
year,
1968-1969.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
yes,
sir,
he
is.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
your
honor,
i
would
--
i've
heard
but
i'd
--
much
rather
you
ask
the
other
side
because
i
would
mind
to
give
you
any
misinformation.
i
think
they
know
and
i
just
--
and
just
here
say
i
might
--
doctor
roth
was
hired
for
the
academic
year,
1968-1969.
he
was
hired
under
a
written
contract,
a
contract
that
had
a
fixed
term,
expressly
fixing
a
term
for
september
1,
1968
through
june
30,
1969.
the
contract
also
expressly
referred
to
section
37.31
of
the
wisconsin
statute
which
is
our
state
tenure
statute.
this
statute
at
that
time
provided
that
if
a
probationary
teacher
is
hired
for
four
consecutive
years,
he'll
acquire
tenure
or
permanent
status.
when
doctor
roth
was
hired,
there
was
a
board
rule
in
effect,
in
fact,
it
had
been
passed
on
march
10th,
1967,
which
provided
that
in
the
case
of
a
probationary
teacher,
no
reasons
will
be
given
for
non-renewal
and
there
will
be
no
hearing
provided
by
the
university
on
the
question
of
non-renewal.
this
same
rule
also
provided
that
in
each
case
of
non-renewal,
the
professor
or
the
employee
will
receive
notice
of
that
fact
by
february
1st.
so
in
effect,
he
has
from
february
1st
to
start
looking
for
a
new
position.
the
procedure
at
oshkosh
state
university
in
regard
to
renewal
or
non-renewal
of
the
probationary
contract
was
that
the
tenure
committee
of
the
particular
department
would
first
meet
and
vote
on
whether
to
recommend
retention
or
non-retention.
in
this
case,
it
was
the
tenure
committee
of
the
department
of
political
science.
that
recommendation
then
flows
up
to
the
dean,
who
also
makes
a
recommendation
and
from
there
it
flows
up
to
the
vice-president,
in-charge
of
academic
affairs,
and
then
to
the
president
for
his
decision.
in
this
particular
instance,
the
tenure
committee
met
and
voted
to
recommend
retention
of
doctor
roth
on
december
17th,
1968.
subsequently,
and
about
five
weeks
later,
dean
arthur
darkin
(ph)
approached
several
members
of
the
tenure
committee
and
asked
them
to
review
this
recommendation.
on
january
27th,
1969,
the
tenure
committee
did
meet
again,
did
review
their
previous
recommendation
and
at
this
time,
voted
for
non-retention.
this
recommendation
then
flowed
up
to
the
dean,
the
vice-president
and
to
the
president
who
made
his
decision
not
to
renew
doctor
roth's
contract
for
the
ensuing
academic
year.
this
notice
was
given
on
january
30,
1969.
doctor
roth
on
february
14th,
1969,
filed
his
complaint
in
the
district
court
seeking
declaratory
judgment
and
seeking
reinstatement
or
a
contract
for
the
ensuing
academic
year.
on
may
16th,
1969,
both
parties
moved
for
summary
judgment
and
on
march
12th,
1970,
the
district
court
granted
the
plaintiffs,
doctor
roth's
motion
in
part.
the
decision
of
the
district
court
held,
one,
that
either
the
state
university
would
have
to
give
doctor
roth
a
contract
for
the
next
academic
year
or
in
the
alternative
that
the
state
university
could
give
doctor
roth
a
written
notice
of
reason
for
non-renewal
and
a
hearing
on
those
reasons.
this
decision
was
appealed
to
the
seventh
circuit
which
affirmed
the
district
court
on
july
1st,
1971.
although
i
have
explained
the
fact
rather
extensively,
it
is
my
opinion,
your
honor,
that
the
fact
in
the
roth
case,
are
absolutely
irrelevant
at
this
time.
the
petitioners
are
not
here
to
defend
the
university's
action
and
not
renewing
professor
roth's
contract.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
no,
sir,
i
don't
believe
it
is,
but
the
board
of
regents
is
in
the
western
district.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
yes,
sir
it
was.
whether
the
university
acted
correctly
or
not
is
still
to
be
litigated
in
the
district
court.
the
present
posture
of
this
case,
does
not
involve
any
questions
of
the
first
amendment
rights
of
doctor
roth.
the
issue
is
basically,
it
is
whether
a
state
university
must
give
a
statement
of
reason
and
a
hearing
on
those
reasons
in
every
case
of
the
non-renewal
of
a
probationary
teacher's
contract.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
oh,
it
makes
a
tremendous
difference.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
in
roth
case,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
your
honor,
we
have
facing
a
--
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
well,
that
complaint
seeks
the
declaratory
judgment.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
no,
sir,
he
will
not
have
gotten
all
he
wants
because
the
defect
remain
that
he
wants
reinstatement
--
i
assume,
i
don't
know,
this
is
what
his
complaint
asks
for.
he
hasn't
changed
it
or
--
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
i
am
not
here
defending
his
non-renewal,
the
propriety
of
the
action
of
the
university
and
non-renewal
--
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
no,
sir,
i
do
not.
no,
sir,
that
facet
of
the
case
must
be
litigated.
to
repeat,
i
am
not
confessing
judgment
in
any
way,
your
honor,
but
because
of
my
personal
doubt
as
to
whether
the
university
acted
correctly
in
not
renewing
doctor
roth's
contract
for
the
ensuing
academic
year.
it
means
to
me
that
there
is
a
fundamental
error
or
wrong
in
the
decisions
below,
because
doctor
roth
made
the
allegation
in
his
complaint
that
his
contract
was
not
renewed
because
of
his
first
amendment
right.
now,
the
decision
below
requires
doctor
roth
to
go
to
this
administrative
agency,
and
to
have
a
hearing
before
the
administrative
agency
which
administrative
agency
is
the
alleged
wrong
doer
to
exhaust
this
remedy
before
he
can
proceed
in
the
district
court
to
determine
whether
his
fundamental
liberties
have
in
fact
been
violated.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
the
issue
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
was
whether
the
contract
was
not
renewed
for
impermissible
reasons
or
for
engaging
in
protected
constitutional
activity.
if
that
is
not
established,
then
the
non-renewal
would
stand.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
he
did
not
have
tenure,
he
was
a
one
year
probationary
teacher
on
his
first
year
of
teaching.
anyway,
in
answer
to
your
question
i
would
say,
no,
i
feel
that
if,
under
the
civil
rights
act,
professor
roth
would
always
be
able
to
come
in
to
the
district
court
and
frame
a
complaint
alleging
that
his
contract
had
not
been
renewed
because
of
his
protected
activity.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
no
sir,
i
am
not
saying
that.
what
i
am
--
the
basis
of
my
argument
is
that
in
administrative
hearing
before
an
agency
that
is
the
alleged
wrong
doer,
such
as
the
university,
or
this
university
can
conduct
their
hearing
on
its
own
motive
and
on
motives
that
might
possibly
involve
fundamental
liberties
just
doesn’t
seem
to
make
sense
to
me
your
honor,
i
think
the
proper
form.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
oh
yes,
we
are
required
to
give
him
a
hearing
by
law.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
no
sir,
it
wouldn’t
because
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
gave
the
probationary
teacher
a
hearing,
then
you
are
destroying
the
very
purpose
of
tenure.
you’re
appreciating
any
distinction
between
the
probationary
teacher
and
the
tenure
teacher.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
in
court
your
honor,
in
court.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
that's
our
only
complaint
your
honor,
yes
sir.
the
hearing
should
have
been
in
the
district
court.
these
facts
should
have
been
litigated
there
and
it’s
not
a
proper
subject
for
an
administrative
hearing
before
a
school
or
university.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
conceded
what
your
honor?
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
he
is
entitled
to
a
hearing
in
the
district
court
as
to
whether
his
fundamental
liberties
or
first
amendment
rights
have
been
violated.
i
do
not
concede
your
honor
that
he
is
entitled
to
a
hearing
in
the
district
court
on
any
other
ground
such
as
the
scholarship
or
competency
or
rapport
with
the
student
bodies.
these
items
are
not
for
the
district
court.
the
only
issue
for
the
district
court
seems
to
me
is
one
of
the
constitutional
rights.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
it's
right,
there
is
nothing
to
do
--
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
well,
that
would
be
true
for
any
governmental
employee.
it
wouldn't
be
necessarily
--
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
not
a
thing,
your
honor,
i
just
wanted
to
make
it
clear
to
the
court
that
the
issue
here
is
due
process
the
law
and
does
not
involve
first
amendment
rights
of
doctor
roth
at
this
time.
the
only
thing
is
due
process
of
law.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
the
due
process
question
is
not
to
be
litigated
in
the
district
court,
your
honor,
the
district
court
ordered
that
in
every
case,
that
they
have
already
decided
it,
they
ordered
that
to
give
him
a
hearing
and
that's
--
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
yes,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
issue
really
is,
is
whether
the
constitution
recognizes
a
state
system
of
statutory
opinion
or
the
maintenance
of
a
meaningful
system
of
tenure
under
state
law
by
creation
of
section
37.31
of
the
statutes,
the
wisconsin
legislature
has
recognized
the
importance
of
having
a
probationary
period
leading
up
to
the
acquisition
of
permanent
employee
status
or
tenure.
the
probationary
employees
as
well
as
the
university
has
a
tremendous
interest
in
maintaining
tenure.
the
district
court
decision
recognizes
and
felt
that
tenure
could
be
maintained
by
application
in
a
case-by-case
basis
of
minimal
ground
for
non-retention.
the
circuit
court
decision
also
recognizes
the
danger
to
the
tenure
system
back
every
brief
in
this
case.
it
seems
to
me,
it
recognizes
the
possibility
of
loss
of
tenure.
the
purposes
of
tenure
are
of
course,
academic
excellence
or
the
obtaining
of
the
best
possible
faculty
for
the
student
body.
tenure
also
affords
protection
for
the
faculty
and
is
absolutely
essential
to
the
maintenance
of
academic
freedom.
the
roth
decision
does
threaten
tenure,
because
it
vitiates
any
distinction
between
the
probationary
employee
and
the
tenured
employee.
this
danger
would
result
from
that
fact
that
these
universities
and
colleges
just
will
not
get
involved
in
administrative
hearings
of
this
sort
or
in
protracted
litigation.
they
will
do
everything
they
can
to
avoid
such
hearings,
including
the
keeping
of
an
incompetence
or
unscholarly
professors.
i
think
this
is
borne
out,
very
clearly
by
the
fact
that
we
had
so
few
discharge
proceedings
as
against
the
tenured
fact
and
so
few
discharged
proceedings
as
against
the
civil
service,
these
things
are
just
not
done
in
government.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
it
was
an
alternative
order
your
honor,
one
--
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
give
him
a
contract
or
give
him
a
hearing.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
i
don't
know
your
honor,
the
district
court
decision
said
that
in
recognizing
the
danger
of
losing
a
recognizable
system
of
tenure,
the
district
court
said
that
the
court
will
recognize
minimal
grounds
for
none
reappointment.
now,
what
he
meant
by
that,
i
don't
know
but
--
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
that's
right.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
no
sir,
it
was
not
--
what
happened,
it
was
an
alternative
order,
one,
give
him
a
contract
and
i
assume
if
we
don't
gave
him
a
contract
we
would
possibly
be
liable
for
damage.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
or
give
him
a
hearing
and
we
immediately
asked
for
a
stay
of
that
decision
or
order
and
immediately
appealed
to
the
circuit
court.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
he
did
not
indicate
other
than
to
say
he
would
respect
minimal
grounds
for
none
--
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
well,
then
we
would
have
to
give
him
a
contract,
we
didn't
give
him
a
contract,
we
would
be
in
contempt
of
court,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
or
a
reason.
dr.
roth
was
hired
with
this
clear
understanding,
this
does
not
come
in
shot
to
him,
this
was
part
of
his
agreement,
he
was
given
a
nine
month
contract
and
no
more.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
no
sir,
i
don't
maintain
that,
i
think
it's
a
great
deal
more
than
mere
contract
law.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
i
think
the
court
has
to
balance
the
interest
here.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
i
have
never
heard
of
that.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
well
i
don't
know,
your
honor,
it's
--
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
my
position
is
basically
this
that
due
process
of
law
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
require
the
procedural
protection
of
a
statement
of
reason
or
a
hearing.
that
due
process
of
law
just
does
not
require.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
yes
sir,
i
guess,
that's
correct.
i
think
in
weighing
the
interest
--
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
yes
sir,
that's
all.
i
can't
conceive
of
any
other
appropriate
issue
for
the
district
court.
now,
the
district
court
in
its
opinion
--
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
yes
sir,
for
very,
very
practical
reason
because
he
is
a
probationary
employee,
and
for
another
thing,
these
situations
are
very,
very
rare
your
honor
in
my
opinion,
and
if
somebody's
constitutional
rights
are
in
fact
infringed,
i
think
in
most
instances,
by
inadvertence
or
ignorance
of
the
constitution.
these
are
not
simple
question.
another
point,
i
don't
see
how
this
sort
of
procedure
that
is
suggested
in
roth
would
really
be
of
only
benefit
to
the
professor
or
would
be
of
any
benefit
to
the
court.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
no
sir,
he,
if
he
feels
that
his
--
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
no,
i
never
intended
to
imply
that
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
absolutely.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
but,
once
you
are
in
litigation
you
have
all
the
procedural
remedies
of
a
trial,
you
have
discovery.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
no
sir,
it
would
not
because
are
talking
about
hundreds
of
cases
of
non-renewal.f
we
are
not
talking
about
just
one
specific
direct
law.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
that's
what
the
district
court
ordered,
that
in
every
case
--
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
yes,
in
every
--
oh
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
in
every
case
where
requested.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
well
there
is
no
way
of
knowing
your
honor,
but
there
are
--
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
it
would
be
an
unnecessary
and
time
consuming
and
wasteful
procedure
to
put
not
only
the
school
truly
your
honor,
but
it
would
be
wasteful
for
the
professor
himself.
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
well,
first
of
all
the
statement
of
reasons
--
i
don't
know
what
type
of
case
we
are
talking
about,
whether
we
are
talking
about
case
that
involves
first
amendment
claim
or
whether
we
are
talking
about
such
things
as
scholarship,
rapport
with
the
student
body
and
so
forth,
it
it
is
that
type
of
a
situation
where
these
things
are
very
difficult
to
articulate
and
these
decisions
are
made
up
by
many,
many
people,
this
isn't
the
decision
of
one
man,
but
this
is
the
decision
of
maybe
twelve
or
fifteen
people
and
to
have
a
hearing
on
whether
this
particular
professor
has
achieved
a
certain
level
of
scholarship.
i
can't
see
where
this
hearing
would
afford
anybody
any
benefit.
it
would
merely
polarize
the
party,
it
would
involve
the
entire
student
body
in
the
case
because
professor
would
call
his
students
and
say,
“well,
now
i
am
a
good
professor,
aren't
i?”
and
the
administration
would
call
students
and
so
forth
and
we
would
just
have
a
one
heck
of
a
mess.
these
things
just
don't
work
that
simply.
also
--
mr.
charles
a.
bleck
that's
it
precisely,
thank
you.
