the
hearings
before
the
district
court
you
think
should
be
held
is
one
purely
--
where
the
first
amendment
rights
have
been
violated?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
i
take
it
you
say
that
the
university,
they
did
not
renew
it
because
of
its
exercise
of
the
first
amendment
rights,
that
the
only
remedy
he
has
is
1983
action
and
the
only
hearing
i
guess
is
the
hearing
on
the
1983
complaint
in
the
court
that
even
on
that
circumstance,
he
is
not
entitled
of
any
hearing
before
a
university.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
i
take
it
you
sustained
your
first
amendment
claim,
then
that
would
be
limited
to
say
that
by
then
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
just
said
something,
under
the
(inaudible).
you
said
that
the
right
to
hearing
stems
from
not
so
much
or
necessarily
from
the
due
process,
as
from
the
fact
the
teaching
profession,
qua-teaching
profession,
served
certain
first
amendment
values
that
the
requirement
of
a
hearing
before
non-renewal
can
be
rested
on
the
service
to
those
first
amendment
values
and
not
necessarily
depend
upon
the
due
process,
did
i
correctly
answered
it?
and
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
a
specific
claim
of
violation
of
first
amendment
rights
alleged
in
the
1983
suit.
