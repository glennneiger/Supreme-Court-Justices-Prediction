justice

white
if
he
wins
in
the
district
court
on
that
issue,
on
being
prior
to
the
constitutional
rights,
he
will
have
that
all
he
wants
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
say
you
are
not
here
defending
his
discharge.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
mean
you
concede
within
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
bleck.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
this
court
were
to
follow
the
tenth
circuit
decision
that
mr.
gottesman
commented
on
in
his
argument,
i
take
it
even
that
subject
wouldn’t
be
open
to
litigation
in
the
district
court,
would
it?
because
as
i
understand
it,
the
respondent
here
didn’t
have
tenure.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
you’re
stating
is
that
it
states
a
good
plan
of
action
under
civil
rights
act,
he
would
be
entitled
to
a
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
may
i
ask
you
again,
let's
assume
you've
had
a
deal
with
the
part
of
the
district
court
order
which
granted
him
hearing
or
you
haven't
brought
the
court
of
appeals
decision
here
and
then
you
had
one
what
was
left
to
be
litigated
in
the
district
court
namely
the
first
amendment
claim.
there
would
still
be
left
the
district
court's
due
process
decision,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
that
mean
in
terms
of
the
relationships
between
the
university
and
law.
does
it
means
that
he
may
not
be
discharged
and
he
must
be
reinstated
until
and
unless
he's
given
a
university
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
so
they
either
reinstate
him
or
give
him
a
hearing.
justice
byron
r.
white
anyway,
the
district
court
didn't
kind
of
played
any
further
proceedings
until
and
unless
the
university
gave
him
a
hearing.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
meanwhile
he
had
to
be
reinstated.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
give
him
a
hearing.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
didn't
indicate
whether
or
not
after
a
hearing
and
a
decision
against
roth,
whether
or
not
the
district
court
would
and
to
what
extent
give
judicial
review
to
that
decision.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
it's
simply
a
matter
of
contract
law
and
as
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
were
in
error
thinking
that
the
constitution
required
the
courts
to
add
something
to
the
parties
with
the
contract,
and
the
day
the
contract
of
the
parties
was
made,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
not
if
the
trial
goes
on,
if
he
requested
hearing,
not
if
the
trial
goes
on
to
the
hearing.
justice
byron
r.
white
a
paper
hearing,
is
it
up?
justice
byron
r.
white
while
we
have
you
interrupted
--
where
is
dr.
roth
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
back-pay
consequences
would
flow
from
the
hearing
out
of
judge
doyle's
decision
below,
with
a
--
university
could
grant
him
a
hearing
upon
remand
and
if
it
granted
the
hearing
and
followed
whatever
procedure
judge
doyle
had
described
and
then
decided
he
was
dismissed
their
would
be
no
back-pay
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
that
--
let’s
assume
that
a
nontenured
teacher
gets
notice
that
his
contract
will
not
be
renewed
and
it
is
stated
in
the
letter,
we
have
no
reason
other
than
the
fact
that
we
think
we
could
find
someone
better
sometimes
than
you
are.
that's
the
only
reason
we
have.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
do
not
claim
you
have
done
anything
wrong
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
the
letter
says,
we
are
not
terminating
your
contract
or
refusing
your
review
because
you
exercised
any
first
amendment
rights
at
all.
we
don't
think
you
even
made
a
speech
anywhere,
but
otherwise
we
have
no
reason,
that's
all
it
says,
we
just
have
no
reason.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
one
are
they
--
justice
byron
r.
white
he
has
a
substantive
right,
not
to
be
fired
without
a
reason
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
non-tenured
teacher?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
he
have
the
right
not
to
be
fired
without
a
good
reason.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
without
any
reason.
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
any
reason
will
do?
i
find
that
if
you
are
wearing
a
mustache
and
i
don’t
like
people
wearing
mustache.
justice
byron
r.
white
were
do
you
draw
the
line
--
–
there
may
be
an
assessment
of
reason,
constitutional
reason,
where
you
differ
the
situation
from
a
tenancy?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
because
of
the
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
the
length
of
his
hair
be
a
cause?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
are
the
substantive
right,
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
must
have
been
the
due
process,
nothing
to
do
with
trial.
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
but
as
i
gather,
you
distinguished
then
the
teacher
from
the
college
administrator,
the
college
janitor,
the
college
--
and
the
other
kind
of,
the
college
football
coach
for
example.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
college
student?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
steinglass,
one
last
question,
during
the
world
war
ii,
student
bodies
dried
up
because
people
were
at
war,
suppose
that
same
kind
of
thing
happened
at
oshkosh
and
the
administration
terminated
90%
of
the
non-tenure
people,
retaining
10%,
would
anyone
of
the
90%
have
the
right
to
a
hearing
on
your
theory?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
because
he
would
have
a
right
to
know
why
he,
rather
than
x
was
let
go.
justice
byron
