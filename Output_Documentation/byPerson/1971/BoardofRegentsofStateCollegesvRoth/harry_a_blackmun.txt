justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
would
like
to
come
back
justice
white's
inquiry
of
what
difference
does
it
make
to
you
in
this
or
any
other
case
once
you've
conceded
this
much?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
you’ve
conceded
a
good
litigated
ase
away.
you
say
your
only
posture
here
that
he
is
entitled
to
a
hearing
in
the
district
court
and
not
at
all
in
the
university
administrative
structure.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
i
gather,
you
say
that,
because
the
action
in
the
1983
is
predicated
on
the
denial
of
constitutional
rights.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
i
gather
you
are
also
saying,
that
predicated
risk
claim,
denial
of
first
amendment.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
he
might
lose
on
that,
and
that
still
be
open
to
question,
pleaded
both
here
and
in
the
other
case,
he's
entitled
to
a
hearing
as
a
matter
of
procedural
due
process
which
says
nothing
right
over
to
do
with
it.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
bleck,
if
he
proves
something
wasn't
referred
to
him,
the
case
is
over
with.
you
haven't
yet
told
me
why
an
administrative
hearing
is
prudent,
other
than
to
say
it
is
the
alleged
wrong
doer
itself,
but
maybe
this
is
the
purpose
of
the
hearings.
