mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
for
this
court
today
is
whether
non-tenured
state
university
professors
are
entitled
to
minimal
due
process?
statement
of
the
reasons
why
their
decision
is
being
--
why
their
contract
is
not
being
renewed
and
a
minimal
opportunity
to
come
forward
with
reasons,
why
that
decision
should
not
be
made?
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
no,
i
don’t
think
so,
i
hope
not.
certainly,
first
of
all
the
statement
of
reasons
is
essential.
the
hearing
itself
would
serve
several
functions.
first
of
all,
whether
all
examples
of
inadvertence,
ignorance,
the
teacher
would
be
able
to
bring
forward
those
reasons
which
would
simply
clarify
the
situation.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
well
i
think
the
answer
to
that
question
has
to
be
look
back
at
the
order
of
the
district
court.
district
court
said
the
burden
would
be
on
professor,
so
the
professor
would
have
the
initial
burden
of
showing
that
either
the
reasons
offered
were
wholly
inappropriate
or
wholly
without
a
basis
in
fact.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
yes.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
i
would
think
that
he
would
be
able
to
have
representation
there.
i
would
think
that
with
a
person
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
no,
no
i
think,
subpeona
power
would
not
have
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
discovery,
i
was
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
no,
i
am
not
talking
about
of
full
panoply
of
rights.
what
i
am
talking
about
is
an
opportunity
to
bring
forward
that
testimony
that
he
has
been
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
i
would
think
so,
i
think
the
major
exception
would
be
that
because
the
district
court
recognized
that
we
were
dealing
with
academic
questions
many
of
which
would
--
many
of
the
decisions
would
rely
on
very
subtle
reasons
that
firstly,
he
had
--
the
court
had
to
report
to
the
university
over
a
very
wide
discretion.
so,
in
a
welfare
case
for
example,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
a
decision
that
there
was
--
in
order
to
deny
a
person
in
a
welfare
system,
you
would
not
simply
have
to
show
that
your
decision
was
wholly
unsupported,
in
fact
the
burden
would
simply
in
that
case
for
a
welfare
director
to
terminate
and
assist
–
and
granted
assistance,
he
would
have
to
show
that
the
facts
did
show
that
person
was
not
eligible,
whereas
in
the
hearing
that
we
are
talking
about,
we
are
talking
about
a
much
smaller
burden
and
that
smaller
burden
is
necessary
because
the
district
court
did
recognize
that
the
university
did
have
an
interest
in
maintaining
the
probationary
system,
in
maintaining
a
system
under
which
they
could
decide
not
to
retain
a
professor
for
something
less
than
foreclause
as
fore
clause
has
come
to
be
known
in
tenure
systems.
so,
i
think
that
would
probably
be
the
major
--
the
most
fundamental
difference
between
a
goldberg
type
hearing
as
part
of
each
of
the
individual
elements
that
the
court
requires
in
goldberg,
i
would
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
yes,
i
think
that
would
be
essential
but
that
still
would
leave
university
great
deal
of
discretion
in
determining
who
that
decision
maker
would
be
that
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
it
has
be
an
independent
examiner
taking
from
outside
of
the
university
system,
although
it
could
be,
it
does
in
the
context
of
the
present
case
defending
giles
(ph)
who
only
became
a
defendant
after
professor
roth
was
denied
minimal
due
process.
professor
giles
(ph)
own
affidavit
says
that
it
is
his
practice
to
simply
receive
recommendations,
to
receive
the
memorandum
outlining
the
reasons
which
were
in
fact
articulated
and
were
not
very
subtle
at
all.
they
said
that
david
roth
violated
a
whole
series
of
university
rules.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
i
would
think
that
that
would
be
essential
your
honor,
that
decision
maker
would
want
to
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
i
thought
the
court
in
goldberg
did
recognize
that
was
offering
minimal
pre-termination
evidentiary
hearing
and
if
the
court
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
but
i
think
the
essential
difference
is
that
and
i
indicated
it
before
is
that
the
burdens
would
be
completely
different
and
in
goldberg
--
in
welfare
type
situations
there
is
the
equivalent
of
a
four
clause
requirement.
if
you
break
x
rule,
you
will
lose
x
benefits,
similarly
with
a
tenure
situations,
there
is
that
almost
of
fore
clause
requirement.
in
this
situation,
in
this
context
there
is
no
such
heavy
burden
on
the
university,
in
fact
the
burden
lies
on
the
professor.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
well
i
would
think
that
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
i
would
think
that
in
each
instance,
someone
would
have
to
undergo
the
balancing
test
that
this
court
has
underdone
in
the
past
and
i
could
well
see,
how
court
might
come
down
on
a
different
side
of
the
equation
with
respect
to
an
elevator
operator,
than
it
might
with
the
professor,
i
think
there
are
certain
differences,
when
one
applies
the
fourteenth
amendment,
balancing
test.
the
court
has
recognized,
when
a
person
is
interested
in
pursuing
the
profession
is
at
stake,
that
that
minimal
due
process
is
required
that
would
truly
form
one
side
of
the
line.
situation
where
a
person
is
capable
of
finding
a
new
employment
where
non-retention
will
not
have
any
adverse
employment
consequences.
a
situation
in
which
a
person
does
not
have
to
put
a
great
deal
of
time
and
effort
in
training
to
acquiring
their
present
position.
although
would
it
has
to
be
weighed
and
might
bring
one
down
on
a
different
side
of
the
line.
so,
it's
hard,
if
there
are
a
lot
of
hypothetical
that
we
could
deal
with,
i
would
think
that
a
decision
that
would
require
a
university
to
provide
a
minimal
due
process
hearing
to
a
university
professor
before
his
non-retention
would
not
necessarily
require
every
governmental
employer
to
provide
that
same
type
of
hearing
to
every
employee
before
they
decide
not
to
retain
him.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
well,
i
think
the
court
has
looked
at
the
interests
of
the
individual
involved
and
i
think
that
would
probably
be
the
answer.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
i
thought
you
would
ask
your
honor,
first
year
he
was
unable
to
find
employment
and
he
had
a
post
doctoral
research,
post
doctoral
position
at
one
of
the
big
time
universities.
after
that
he
was
able
to
find
a
job
and
is
presently
teaching
at
state
university
in
indiana.
so,
probably
in
cases
like
this
is,
that
it
is
not
clear
when
the
initial
act
complained
of
occurs,
what
the
damage
will
be,
the
damage
may
be
strung
at
whole
for
a
long
period
of
time
when
dr.
roth
commenced
this
action
in
federal
court
in
february,
1969,
he
did
allege
that
he
believed
there
would
be
a
damage
to
his
professional
reputation,
at
that
time
it
was
not
possible
for
him
to
know
what
situation
would
be
1,
2,
3,
4
years
hence.
i
think
there
are
a
good
number
of
federal
courts
in
the
country,
who
have
an
individual
cases
found
damage
to
professional
reputation
being
a
significant
injury
and
being
one
that
flows
from
a
non-retention
decisions.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
at
this
point,
judge
doyle
has
not
--
i
think
by
implication
by
delaying
--
by
not
rendering
a
decision,
we
would
then
–
one
or
two
months
after,
it
was
commenced.
the
suit
was
commenced
in
the
69,
february,
69,
at
that
point
roth
was
asking
for
reinstatement
of
following
the
academic
year.
the
motions
for
summary
judgment
were
not
granted
until
march,
70.
the
order
which
is
appealed
from
this
case
said
provide
him
a
hearing
or
grant
him
a
contract
for
the
following
academic
year.
so
the
answer
to
the
question
is
that,
at
this
point
no
one
had
ordered
back-pay.
well,
we
of
course
would
feel
free
to
go
back
to
the
district
court
and
ask
that
the
court
consider
the
other
issues
which
it
left
in
advance
during
the
tendency
of
this
and
we
would
think
that
those
substantive
first
amendment
issues
may
give
rise
to
a
claim
for
back-pay.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
at
the
time,
the
suit
was
filed,
reinstatement
at
this
point
if
we
had
--
when
we
go
back
because
the
only
issue
for
the
court
is
a
procedural
due
process
issue,
we
will
have
to
reexamine
what
we
will
be
seeking.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
no,
damage
--
the
defendant
giles
(ph)
was
sued
in
his
individual
capacity
as
well
as
in
his
official
capacity
--
so
as
far
as
his
individual
capacity
we
could
pursue
that.
the
question
of
why
we
are
here
today
is
one
that
i
put
it
back
sometime
also.
i
would
have
hoped
that
the
order
the
district
court
which
simply
have
stated
in
effect
and
that
we
could
have
had
an
administrative
hearing
at
wisconsin
state
university,
oshkosh,
i
think
such
hearing
would
have
had
advantages
that
not
at
least
of
which
it
would
have
given
persons
with
academic
expertise
and
background,
the
first
opportunity
to
review
a
case
dealing
with
issues
arising
out
of
an
academic
context,
that
in
itself
would
be
valuable
in
terms
of
the
resolution
of
controversies
like
this
within
university
itself,
it
would
make
the
issues
much
more
simple
for
district
courts
and
if
they
do
reach
those
forums.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
yes,
they
would
receive
a
statement
of
reasons
why
they
were
being
destroyed
in
that
case
and
they
would
have
a
hearing
on
that?
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
i
have
never
seen
one
of
those
hearings.
i
do
not
think
that
it
wouldn't
and
that
judge
doyle
has
not
ruled
on
any
of
the
elements
of
the
hearing,
his
ruling
was
rather
narrowed
down,
a
minimal
hearing,
i
think
the
major
difference
again
would
be
the
standard
that
was
to
be
applied,
a
teacher
with
tenure
would
only
be
dismissed
for
a
clause
and
that
for
clause
has
a
great
deal
of
substance,
even
though
it's
too
a
rather
simple
word
and
that
substantive
difference
in
the
standards
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
well,
i
would
like
it
to
be
the
same
--
doctor
roth
as
it
would
be
for
the
tenured
teacher.
i
don't
think
this
court
necessarily
has
to
conclude
that
if
they
chose
to
affirm
a
decision
about
the
district
court,
the
district
court
is
very
careful
in
pointing
out
that
it
was
a
minimal
type
hearing,
i
don't
want
to
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
right,
i
think
for
good
reason
your
honor,
these
cases
will
be
coming
up
in
the
future
in
districts,
both
in
wisconsin
and
then
other
parts
of
this
country
and
i
think,
the
determination
of
what
a
minimal
hearing
would
consist
of,
outweighed
a
case
by
case
determination
by
the
courts.
i
think,
there
is
good
advantage
not
to
create
a
constitutional
straitjacket
in
which
every
university
must
fit.
i
think,
there
is
a
all
great
deal
of
variations
within
the
phrase
minimal
due
process.
i
try
to
point
out,
want
to
prove
them
when
i
discuss
the
identity
of
the
examiner,
it
could
be
within
the
university,
it
could
be
outside
of
the
university,
it
could
have
been
defendant
giles
when
he
had
received
the
statement
of
reasons
why
david
roth
was
being
not
retained,
decided
to
call
david
roth
and
then
ask
him,
“did
you
devote
one-half
to
three-quarters
of
your
time
of
quest
talking
about
extraneous
matters?
did
you
miss
this
day
in
class?
did
you
make
those
public
statements,
all
of
which
formed
a
basis
or
which
were
in
a
memorandum
which
counsel
was
able
to
discover,
in
pre-trial
discovery,”
but
unfortunately
was
unable
to
obtain
prior
to
the
initiating
such
action.
the
constitutional
basis
for
the
situation
we’re
advancing
is
alternatively
the
first
or
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it
is
our
legal
position
that
when
a
non-tenured
teacher
is
facing
retention
for
reasons
which
may
–
is
facing
retentions
for
those
reasons
on
which
the
retention
is
based,
may
implicate
first
amendment
values.
roth's
(inaudible)
him
to
a
statement
of
reasons
and
to
a
minimal
hearing.
the
present
case
is
quite
good
as
far
as
illustrating,
what
the
hearing
would
have
accomplished,
the
reasons
in
the
present
case
did
on
your
face
implicate
first
amendment
speech,
the
university
relied
on
three
quotes
that
david
roth
was
alleged
of.
in
fact,
did
make
--
they
alleged
that
these
quotations,
evidenced
(inaudible)
approach
to
the
truth,
thereby
making
him
unfit
to
remain
for
another
academic
year,
although
he
was
certainly
fit
to
remain
for
the
rest
of
the
present
academic
year,
because
he
was
non-retained
rather
than
discharged.
at
a
hearing
he
would
have
been
able
to
bring
forward
evidence
showing
that
number
one,
he
did
substantiate
the
claims
that
the
university
alleged,
who
had
been
unsubstantiated,
number
two,
he
would
have
been
able
to
bring
forward
evidence
showing
that
each
of
the
individual
infractions,
which
he
was
alleged
to
a
committee
did
not
take
place
as
it
was.
he
was
finally
able
to
bring
forward
that
evidence
in
the
form
of
affidavits
in
the
district
court
on
the
motions
of
summery
judgment,
but
not
before
them.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
well,
i
am
suggesting
that
through
the
experience
of
keeping
a
teacher
to
the
end
of
the
year
and
simply
saying
now
we
decide
not
to
retain
you
and
so
since,
wisconsin
statute
do
not
provide
any
procedures
and
in
fact
don’t
limit
us
to
the
reasons
we
might
choose,
we
will
do
it
this
way,
rather
than
saying,
well
we
better
get
rid
of
you
right
now.
i
would
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
well,
i
wouldn't
want
the
university
to
violate
the
contractual
rights,
but
if
he
was
unfit
or
not
a
proper
teacher,
the
university
could
simply
offer
to
pay
out
his
salary,
if
it
became
that
serious,
but
i
think
the
real
point
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
that's
certainly
a
distinction
between
the
two.
in
undertaking,
the
balancing
approach
that
this
court's
decisions
have
acquired
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
minimal
procedural
safeguards
will
be
extended
to
persons
whose
interests
are
adversely
affected.
the
district
court
did
take
into
consideration
the
value
of
a
tenure
system
and
very
carefully
attempted
not
to
dilute
the
tenure
system
in
anyway.
we
have
the
suggestion
however
that
the
decision
somehow
vitiates
the
distinction
between
tenure
and
less
than
tenure.
the
opinions
below
both
the
district
court
and
circuit
court
made
clear,
there
was
no
intention
to
vitiate
the
legal
distinction
between
those
two,
between
status
tenure
and
lack
of
tenure.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
and
the
teacher
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
and
the
teacher
doesn't
believe
that
that's
pretext
here
i
believe
that's
an
honest
reason.
as
far
as,
the
substantive
reason
i
think,
that
that
would
be
a
valid
reason,
for
a
non-tenured
teacher
to
be
terminated.
it
would
not
be
a
valid
reason
to
let
a
tenured
teacher
go
but
nevertheless,
the
non-tenured
teacher
might
well
believe
that
not
to
be
the
real
reason.
so,
i
think
that
he
would
have
the
right
to
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
well
they
can
see,
in
other
words
they
can
see
they
have
no
reason,
it's
not
that
they
can’t
give
you,
when
they
don't
have
one.
that
--
if
i
understand
that
question
correctly,
that
might
become
so
arbitrary
as
to
violate
some
of
substantive
requirements
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
no
your
honor,
the
burden
would
definitely
be
on
the
professor.
the
professor
would
have
to
show
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
yes.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
without
any
--
i
mean,
no,
we
are
not
just
--
we
are
just
saying
that
one
day
the
president
comes
and
says,
“today
i
am
going
to
fire
somebody,
you
are
the
most
likely
candidate,”
i
would
think
that
that
might
well
be
arbitrary
and
capricious
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
well,
good
reason
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
without
any
reason
whatsoever.
i
would
--
it's
an
extremely
abstract
question,
but
i
think
the
answer
would
have
to
be
yes,
you
have
to
have
a
reason
even
if
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
no
i
think,
no.
i
think,
that
might
be,
that
reason
might
be
improper
and
then
i
am
not,
the
point
is
not
whether
or
not
it
is
in
fact
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
whatever,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
are
any
substantive
protection
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
more
a
question,
a
question
of
where
those
substantive
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
a
tenured
teacher
could
not
be
terminated
and
if
he,
more
of
the
reason,
i
want
to
say,
that
we
found
somebody
better.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
but
at
times
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
that's
right,
i
would
think
cause
has
been
interpreted
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
for
a
tenured
teacher?
i
would
hope
not
--
but
again,
try
to
draw
the
substantive,
rely
that
a
substantive
reason
--
it
is
just
extremely
difficult,
the
point
before
the
court,
is
that
there
must
be
some
reasons
which
are
so
absolutely
devoid
of
reason,
that
are
so
wholly
unreasoned,
that
are
so
wholly
without
a
basis
in
fact,
that
relies
on
them,
would
constitute
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
that
is
essentially
what
happened
here.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
well,
if
this
court
was
to
accept,
the
position
that
advanced
by
david
roth,
the
teacher
would
be
able
to
request
to
the
university,
that
they
provide
him
with
the
reasons
and
their
failure
to
do
so
would
seem
to
me
would
violate
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
well,
i
would
think
that
a
professor
at
that
point
would
be
able
to
request
a
hearing
and
at
which
time
he
would
have
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
well,
he
would
then
have
the
burden
on
him
to
bring
in
testimony
and
show
that
reason
was
wholly
–
and
he
did
cut
the
mustard,
however
i
would
think
that
a
reason
like
that
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
no,
i
am
not
--
professor.
i
don't
want
to
overestimate
the
beneficence
of
universities,
but
i
don't
think
universities
are
going
to
come
up
with
the
reasons
like
that.
i
think
university
administrations
will
be
on
it,
and
will
provide
the
reasons
and
i
would
think
they
would
all
be
required
to
provide
the
reasons,
it's
sufficient
detail,
so
that
a
response
is
capable
of
being
framed.
i
think
that
might
be
a
little
vague
but
again,
at
the
hearing
the
burden
lies
on
the
professor
shows
the
reasons
chosen
are
not
wholly
inappropriate,
the
reason
was
that,
we
are
being
firm
--
you
are
not
being
renewed
because
you
drive
a
yellow
rather
that
a
green
car.
i
could
well
--
i
might
conclude
that
that
reason
might
be
so
insubstantial,
so
that
it
would
violate
some
of
the
substantive
rights.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
the
fourteenth
amendment,
i
mean
the
case
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
yes
your
honor.
i
think
in
the
schware
case
this
court
dealing
with
a
mission
to
a
bar
relied
on
the
substantive
--
on
that
particular
provision.
i
don't
think
--
i
recognized
the
difficulty
in
trying
to
put
content
into
that
particular
clause
or
i
would
say
that
there
are
some
reasons
that
are
so
arbitrary,
so
without
foundation
that
it
would
be
a
violation,
but
let
me
make
one
very
important
point,
we
are
not
resting
our
case
on
an
attempt
to
resurrect
the
fourteenth
amendment,
what
we
are
saying
is
that
the
first
amendment
requires
that
a
teacher
should
be
provided
with
statement
of
reasons
and
minimal
due
process
hearing.
we
would
say
that
there
is
an
also
an
argument
to
be
made
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
requires
it,
not
only
--
not
because
there
is
a
right,
there
is
substantive
due
process
right,
but
because
a
decision
terminating
or
not
renewing
a
teacher
adversely
affects
very
fundamental
interests
of
that
teacher.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
a
lot
of
the
lawyers
in
this
area,
your
honor
--
and
administratively
slip
in
their
terminology
and
facts,
perhaps
that's
indicative
of
the
fact,
that
even
the
lawyers
and
administrators
in
the
area
do
not
see
that
substantial
difference
between
the
two,
i
mean
non-renewed,
non-retained,
and
as
far
as
the
specific
questions,
i
can
see,
specifically
different
bouncing
being
made
in
point
of
that,
with
respect
to
the
hearing
rights
of
the
person
who
has
denied
an
initial
application,
it
seemed
that
his
hearing
rights
would
be
--
his
interests
would
be
quite
small
and
probably
would
not
entitle
him
to
a
hearing,
again
that
decision
doesn't
have
to
be
reached,
but
certainly
no
stigma
would
flow
from
the
failure
to
get
a
job
and
certainly
not
the
same
stigma
that
would
flow
from
being
not
retained
on
the
relocation
problems,
would
not
flow,
from
not
receiving
the
job,
with
lots
of
income
and
income
was
never
coming
in,
but
certainly
not
be
a
direct
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
that's
correct,
we
will
go
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
that's
part
of
that
but
in
addition,
in
this
case
the
reasons
that
were
discovered
did
in
fact
implicate
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
i
would
say
we
don't
have
to
reach
that
question
and
the
different
bouncing
would
be
undertaken
in
each
case.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
well,
this
court
in
goldberg
did
site
approvingly
the
dickson
case
for
the
fifth
circuit,
i
would
say,
college
student
probably
would
if
those
person
not
ruled
out
it
would
probably
be
entire
--
there
is
a
minimal
due
process
for
court,
he
has
to
leave
and
pointed
back,
one
of
roth's
public
statements
dealt
with
the
fact
that
students
had
been
terminated
without
due
process
and
ironic
twist
that
he
is
here
today
asking
such
rights
for
himself.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
i
think
they
would
have
the
right,
i
think
that
reason
that
you
stated
would
be
a
perfectly
a
legitimate
reason,
i
can't
see
any
logic
behind
a
professor
asserting
his
right
to
a
hearing
in
that
situation.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
yes.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
for
this
court
today
is
whether
non-tenured
state
university
professors
are
entitled
to
minimal
due
process?
statement
of
the
reasons
why
their
decision
is
being
--
why
their
contract
is
not
being
renewed
and
a
minimal
opportunity
to
come
forward
with
reasons,
why
that
decision
should
not
be
made?
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
no,
i
don’t
think
so,
i
hope
not.
certainly,
first
of
all
the
statement
of
reasons
is
essential.
the
hearing
itself
would
serve
several
functions.
first
of
all,
whether
all
examples
of
inadvertence,
ignorance,
the
teacher
would
be
able
to
bring
forward
those
reasons
which
would
simply
clarify
the
situation.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
well
i
think
the
answer
to
that
question
has
to
be
look
back
at
the
order
of
the
district
court.
district
court
said
the
burden
would
be
on
professor,
so
the
professor
would
have
the
initial
burden
of
showing
that
either
the
reasons
offered
were
wholly
inappropriate
or
wholly
without
a
basis
in
fact.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
yes.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
i
would
think
that
he
would
be
able
to
have
representation
there.
i
would
think
that
with
a
person
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
no,
no
i
think,
subpeona
power
would
not
have
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
discovery,
i
was
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
no,
i
am
not
talking
about
of
full
panoply
of
rights.
what
i
am
talking
about
is
an
opportunity
to
bring
forward
that
testimony
that
he
has
been
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
i
would
think
so,
i
think
the
major
exception
would
be
that
because
the
district
court
recognized
that
we
were
dealing
with
academic
questions
many
of
which
would
--
many
of
the
decisions
would
rely
on
very
subtle
reasons
that
firstly,
he
had
--
the
court
had
to
report
to
the
university
over
a
very
wide
discretion.
so,
in
a
welfare
case
for
example,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
a
decision
that
there
was
--
in
order
to
deny
a
person
in
a
welfare
system,
you
would
not
simply
have
to
show
that
your
decision
was
wholly
unsupported,
in
fact
the
burden
would
simply
in
that
case
for
a
welfare
director
to
terminate
and
assist
–
and
granted
assistance,
he
would
have
to
show
that
the
facts
did
show
that
person
was
not
eligible,
whereas
in
the
hearing
that
we
are
talking
about,
we
are
talking
about
a
much
smaller
burden
and
that
smaller
burden
is
necessary
because
the
district
court
did
recognize
that
the
university
did
have
an
interest
in
maintaining
the
probationary
system,
in
maintaining
a
system
under
which
they
could
decide
not
to
retain
a
professor
for
something
less
than
foreclause
as
fore
clause
has
come
to
be
known
in
tenure
systems.
so,
i
think
that
would
probably
be
the
major
--
the
most
fundamental
difference
between
a
goldberg
type
hearing
as
part
of
each
of
the
individual
elements
that
the
court
requires
in
goldberg,
i
would
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
yes,
i
think
that
would
be
essential
but
that
still
would
leave
university
great
deal
of
discretion
in
determining
who
that
decision
maker
would
be
that
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
it
has
be
an
independent
examiner
taking
from
outside
of
the
university
system,
although
it
could
be,
it
does
in
the
context
of
the
present
case
defending
giles
(ph)
who
only
became
a
defendant
after
professor
roth
was
denied
minimal
due
process.
professor
giles
(ph)
own
affidavit
says
that
it
is
his
practice
to
simply
receive
recommendations,
to
receive
the
memorandum
outlining
the
reasons
which
were
in
fact
articulated
and
were
not
very
subtle
at
all.
they
said
that
david
roth
violated
a
whole
series
of
university
rules.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
i
would
think
that
that
would
be
essential
your
honor,
that
decision
maker
would
want
to
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
i
thought
the
court
in
goldberg
did
recognize
that
was
offering
minimal
pre-termination
evidentiary
hearing
and
if
the
court
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
but
i
think
the
essential
difference
is
that
and
i
indicated
it
before
is
that
the
burdens
would
be
completely
different
and
in
goldberg
--
in
welfare
type
situations
there
is
the
equivalent
of
a
four
clause
requirement.
if
you
break
x
rule,
you
will
lose
x
benefits,
similarly
with
a
tenure
situations,
there
is
that
almost
of
fore
clause
requirement.
in
this
situation,
in
this
context
there
is
no
such
heavy
burden
on
the
university,
in
fact
the
burden
lies
on
the
professor.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
well
i
would
think
that
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
i
would
think
that
in
each
instance,
someone
would
have
to
undergo
the
balancing
test
that
this
court
has
underdone
in
the
past
and
i
could
well
see,
how
court
might
come
down
on
a
different
side
of
the
equation
with
respect
to
an
elevator
operator,
than
it
might
with
the
professor,
i
think
there
are
certain
differences,
when
one
applies
the
fourteenth
amendment,
balancing
test.
the
court
has
recognized,
when
a
person
is
interested
in
pursuing
the
profession
is
at
stake,
that
that
minimal
due
process
is
required
that
would
truly
form
one
side
of
the
line.
situation
where
a
person
is
capable
of
finding
a
new
employment
where
non-retention
will
not
have
any
adverse
employment
consequences.
a
situation
in
which
a
person
does
not
have
to
put
a
great
deal
of
time
and
effort
in
training
to
acquiring
their
present
position.
although
would
it
has
to
be
weighed
and
might
bring
one
down
on
a
different
side
of
the
line.
so,
it's
hard,
if
there
are
a
lot
of
hypothetical
that
we
could
deal
with,
i
would
think
that
a
decision
that
would
require
a
university
to
provide
a
minimal
due
process
hearing
to
a
university
professor
before
his
non-retention
would
not
necessarily
require
every
governmental
employer
to
provide
that
same
type
of
hearing
to
every
employee
before
they
decide
not
to
retain
him.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
well,
i
think
the
court
has
looked
at
the
interests
of
the
individual
involved
and
i
think
that
would
probably
be
the
answer.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
i
thought
you
would
ask
your
honor,
first
year
he
was
unable
to
find
employment
and
he
had
a
post
doctoral
research,
post
doctoral
position
at
one
of
the
big
time
universities.
after
that
he
was
able
to
find
a
job
and
is
presently
teaching
at
state
university
in
indiana.
so,
probably
in
cases
like
this
is,
that
it
is
not
clear
when
the
initial
act
complained
of
occurs,
what
the
damage
will
be,
the
damage
may
be
strung
at
whole
for
a
long
period
of
time
when
dr.
roth
commenced
this
action
in
federal
court
in
february,
1969,
he
did
allege
that
he
believed
there
would
be
a
damage
to
his
professional
reputation,
at
that
time
it
was
not
possible
for
him
to
know
what
situation
would
be
1,
2,
3,
4
years
hence.
i
think
there
are
a
good
number
of
federal
courts
in
the
country,
who
have
an
individual
cases
found
damage
to
professional
reputation
being
a
significant
injury
and
being
one
that
flows
from
a
non-retention
decisions.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
at
this
point,
judge
doyle
has
not
--
i
think
by
implication
by
delaying
--
by
not
rendering
a
decision,
we
would
then
–
one
or
two
months
after,
it
was
commenced.
the
suit
was
commenced
in
the
69,
february,
69,
at
that
point
roth
was
asking
for
reinstatement
of
following
the
academic
year.
the
motions
for
summary
judgment
were
not
granted
until
march,
70.
the
order
which
is
appealed
from
this
case
said
provide
him
a
hearing
or
grant
him
a
contract
for
the
following
academic
year.
so
the
answer
to
the
question
is
that,
at
this
point
no
one
had
ordered
back-pay.
well,
we
of
course
would
feel
free
to
go
back
to
the
district
court
and
ask
that
the
court
consider
the
other
issues
which
it
left
in
advance
during
the
tendency
of
this
and
we
would
think
that
those
substantive
first
amendment
issues
may
give
rise
to
a
claim
for
back-pay.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
at
the
time,
the
suit
was
filed,
reinstatement
at
this
point
if
we
had
--
when
we
go
back
because
the
only
issue
for
the
court
is
a
procedural
due
process
issue,
we
will
have
to
reexamine
what
we
will
be
seeking.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
no,
damage
--
the
defendant
giles
(ph)
was
sued
in
his
individual
capacity
as
well
as
in
his
official
capacity
--
so
as
far
as
his
individual
capacity
we
could
pursue
that.
the
question
of
why
we
are
here
today
is
one
that
i
put
it
back
sometime
also.
i
would
have
hoped
that
the
order
the
district
court
which
simply
have
stated
in
effect
and
that
we
could
have
had
an
administrative
hearing
at
wisconsin
state
university,
oshkosh,
i
think
such
hearing
would
have
had
advantages
that
not
at
least
of
which
it
would
have
given
persons
with
academic
expertise
and
background,
the
first
opportunity
to
review
a
case
dealing
with
issues
arising
out
of
an
academic
context,
that
in
itself
would
be
valuable
in
terms
of
the
resolution
of
controversies
like
this
within
university
itself,
it
would
make
the
issues
much
more
simple
for
district
courts
and
if
they
do
reach
those
forums.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
yes,
they
would
receive
a
statement
of
reasons
why
they
were
being
destroyed
in
that
case
and
they
would
have
a
hearing
on
that?
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
i
have
never
seen
one
of
those
hearings.
i
do
not
think
that
it
wouldn't
and
that
judge
doyle
has
not
ruled
on
any
of
the
elements
of
the
hearing,
his
ruling
was
rather
narrowed
down,
a
minimal
hearing,
i
think
the
major
difference
again
would
be
the
standard
that
was
to
be
applied,
a
teacher
with
tenure
would
only
be
dismissed
for
a
clause
and
that
for
clause
has
a
great
deal
of
substance,
even
though
it's
too
a
rather
simple
word
and
that
substantive
difference
in
the
standards
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
well,
i
would
like
it
to
be
the
same
--
doctor
roth
as
it
would
be
for
the
tenured
teacher.
i
don't
think
this
court
necessarily
has
to
conclude
that
if
they
chose
to
affirm
a
decision
about
the
district
court,
the
district
court
is
very
careful
in
pointing
out
that
it
was
a
minimal
type
hearing,
i
don't
want
to
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
right,
i
think
for
good
reason
your
honor,
these
cases
will
be
coming
up
in
the
future
in
districts,
both
in
wisconsin
and
then
other
parts
of
this
country
and
i
think,
the
determination
of
what
a
minimal
hearing
would
consist
of,
outweighed
a
case
by
case
determination
by
the
courts.
i
think,
there
is
good
advantage
not
to
create
a
constitutional
straitjacket
in
which
every
university
must
fit.
i
think,
there
is
a
all
great
deal
of
variations
within
the
phrase
minimal
due
process.
i
try
to
point
out,
want
to
prove
them
when
i
discuss
the
identity
of
the
examiner,
it
could
be
within
the
university,
it
could
be
outside
of
the
university,
it
could
have
been
defendant
giles
when
he
had
received
the
statement
of
reasons
why
david
roth
was
being
not
retained,
decided
to
call
david
roth
and
then
ask
him,
“did
you
devote
one-half
to
three-quarters
of
your
time
of
quest
talking
about
extraneous
matters?
did
you
miss
this
day
in
class?
did
you
make
those
public
statements,
all
of
which
formed
a
basis
or
which
were
in
a
memorandum
which
counsel
was
able
to
discover,
in
pre-trial
discovery,”
but
unfortunately
was
unable
to
obtain
prior
to
the
initiating
such
action.
the
constitutional
basis
for
the
situation
we’re
advancing
is
alternatively
the
first
or
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it
is
our
legal
position
that
when
a
non-tenured
teacher
is
facing
retention
for
reasons
which
may
–
is
facing
retentions
for
those
reasons
on
which
the
retention
is
based,
may
implicate
first
amendment
values.
roth's
(inaudible)
him
to
a
statement
of
reasons
and
to
a
minimal
hearing.
the
present
case
is
quite
good
as
far
as
illustrating,
what
the
hearing
would
have
accomplished,
the
reasons
in
the
present
case
did
on
your
face
implicate
first
amendment
speech,
the
university
relied
on
three
quotes
that
david
roth
was
alleged
of.
in
fact,
did
make
--
they
alleged
that
these
quotations,
evidenced
(inaudible)
approach
to
the
truth,
thereby
making
him
unfit
to
remain
for
another
academic
year,
although
he
was
certainly
fit
to
remain
for
the
rest
of
the
present
academic
year,
because
he
was
non-retained
rather
than
discharged.
at
a
hearing
he
would
have
been
able
to
bring
forward
evidence
showing
that
number
one,
he
did
substantiate
the
claims
that
the
university
alleged,
who
had
been
unsubstantiated,
number
two,
he
would
have
been
able
to
bring
forward
evidence
showing
that
each
of
the
individual
infractions,
which
he
was
alleged
to
a
committee
did
not
take
place
as
it
was.
he
was
finally
able
to
bring
forward
that
evidence
in
the
form
of
affidavits
in
the
district
court
on
the
motions
of
summery
judgment,
but
not
before
them.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
well,
i
am
suggesting
that
through
the
experience
of
keeping
a
teacher
to
the
end
of
the
year
and
simply
saying
now
we
decide
not
to
retain
you
and
so
since,
wisconsin
statute
do
not
provide
any
procedures
and
in
fact
don’t
limit
us
to
the
reasons
we
might
choose,
we
will
do
it
this
way,
rather
than
saying,
well
we
better
get
rid
of
you
right
now.
i
would
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
well,
i
wouldn't
want
the
university
to
violate
the
contractual
rights,
but
if
he
was
unfit
or
not
a
proper
teacher,
the
university
could
simply
offer
to
pay
out
his
salary,
if
it
became
that
serious,
but
i
think
the
real
point
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
that's
certainly
a
distinction
between
the
two.
in
undertaking,
the
balancing
approach
that
this
court's
decisions
have
acquired
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
minimal
procedural
safeguards
will
be
extended
to
persons
whose
interests
are
adversely
affected.
the
district
court
did
take
into
consideration
the
value
of
a
tenure
system
and
very
carefully
attempted
not
to
dilute
the
tenure
system
in
anyway.
we
have
the
suggestion
however
that
the
decision
somehow
vitiates
the
distinction
between
tenure
and
less
than
tenure.
the
opinions
below
both
the
district
court
and
circuit
court
made
clear,
there
was
no
intention
to
vitiate
the
legal
distinction
between
those
two,
between
status
tenure
and
lack
of
tenure.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
and
the
teacher
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
and
the
teacher
doesn't
believe
that
that's
pretext
here
i
believe
that's
an
honest
reason.
as
far
as,
the
substantive
reason
i
think,
that
that
would
be
a
valid
reason,
for
a
non-tenured
teacher
to
be
terminated.
it
would
not
be
a
valid
reason
to
let
a
tenured
teacher
go
but
nevertheless,
the
non-tenured
teacher
might
well
believe
that
not
to
be
the
real
reason.
so,
i
think
that
he
would
have
the
right
to
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
well
they
can
see,
in
other
words
they
can
see
they
have
no
reason,
it's
not
that
they
can’t
give
you,
when
they
don't
have
one.
that
--
if
i
understand
that
question
correctly,
that
might
become
so
arbitrary
as
to
violate
some
of
substantive
requirements
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
no
your
honor,
the
burden
would
definitely
be
on
the
professor.
the
professor
would
have
to
show
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
yes.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
without
any
--
i
mean,
no,
we
are
not
just
--
we
are
just
saying
that
one
day
the
president
comes
and
says,
“today
i
am
going
to
fire
somebody,
you
are
the
most
likely
candidate,”
i
would
think
that
that
might
well
be
arbitrary
and
capricious
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
well,
good
reason
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
without
any
reason
whatsoever.
i
would
--
it's
an
extremely
abstract
question,
but
i
think
the
answer
would
have
to
be
yes,
you
have
to
have
a
reason
even
if
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
no
i
think,
no.
i
think,
that
might
be,
that
reason
might
be
improper
and
then
i
am
not,
the
point
is
not
whether
or
not
it
is
in
fact
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
whatever,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
are
any
substantive
protection
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
more
a
question,
a
question
of
where
those
substantive
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
a
tenured
teacher
could
not
be
terminated
and
if
he,
more
of
the
reason,
i
want
to
say,
that
we
found
somebody
better.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
but
at
times
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
that's
right,
i
would
think
cause
has
been
interpreted
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
for
a
tenured
teacher?
i
would
hope
not
--
but
again,
try
to
draw
the
substantive,
rely
that
a
substantive
reason
--
it
is
just
extremely
difficult,
the
point
before
the
court,
is
that
there
must
be
some
reasons
which
are
so
absolutely
devoid
of
reason,
that
are
so
wholly
unreasoned,
that
are
so
wholly
without
a
basis
in
fact,
that
relies
on
them,
would
constitute
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
that
is
essentially
what
happened
here.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
well,
if
this
court
was
to
accept,
the
position
that
advanced
by
david
roth,
the
teacher
would
be
able
to
request
to
the
university,
that
they
provide
him
with
the
reasons
and
their
failure
to
do
so
would
seem
to
me
would
violate
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
well,
i
would
think
that
a
professor
at
that
point
would
be
able
to
request
a
hearing
and
at
which
time
he
would
have
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
well,
he
would
then
have
the
burden
on
him
to
bring
in
testimony
and
show
that
reason
was
wholly
–
and
he
did
cut
the
mustard,
however
i
would
think
that
a
reason
like
that
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
no,
i
am
not
--
professor.
i
don't
want
to
overestimate
the
beneficence
of
universities,
but
i
don't
think
universities
are
going
to
come
up
with
the
reasons
like
that.
i
think
university
administrations
will
be
on
it,
and
will
provide
the
reasons
and
i
would
think
they
would
all
be
required
to
provide
the
reasons,
it's
sufficient
detail,
so
that
a
response
is
capable
of
being
framed.
i
think
that
might
be
a
little
vague
but
again,
at
the
hearing
the
burden
lies
on
the
professor
shows
the
reasons
chosen
are
not
wholly
inappropriate,
the
reason
was
that,
we
are
being
firm
--
you
are
not
being
renewed
because
you
drive
a
yellow
rather
that
a
green
car.
i
could
well
--
i
might
conclude
that
that
reason
might
be
so
insubstantial,
so
that
it
would
violate
some
of
the
substantive
rights.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
the
fourteenth
amendment,
i
mean
the
case
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
yes
your
honor.
i
think
in
the
schware
case
this
court
dealing
with
a
mission
to
a
bar
relied
on
the
substantive
--
on
that
particular
provision.
i
don't
think
--
i
recognized
the
difficulty
in
trying
to
put
content
into
that
particular
clause
or
i
would
say
that
there
are
some
reasons
that
are
so
arbitrary,
so
without
foundation
that
it
would
be
a
violation,
but
let
me
make
one
very
important
point,
we
are
not
resting
our
case
on
an
attempt
to
resurrect
the
fourteenth
amendment,
what
we
are
saying
is
that
the
first
amendment
requires
that
a
teacher
should
be
provided
with
statement
of
reasons
and
minimal
due
process
hearing.
we
would
say
that
there
is
an
also
an
argument
to
be
made
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
requires
it,
not
only
--
not
because
there
is
a
right,
there
is
substantive
due
process
right,
but
because
a
decision
terminating
or
not
renewing
a
teacher
adversely
affects
very
fundamental
interests
of
that
teacher.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
a
lot
of
the
lawyers
in
this
area,
your
honor
--
and
administratively
slip
in
their
terminology
and
facts,
perhaps
that's
indicative
of
the
fact,
that
even
the
lawyers
and
administrators
in
the
area
do
not
see
that
substantial
difference
between
the
two,
i
mean
non-renewed,
non-retained,
and
as
far
as
the
specific
questions,
i
can
see,
specifically
different
bouncing
being
made
in
point
of
that,
with
respect
to
the
hearing
rights
of
the
person
who
has
denied
an
initial
application,
it
seemed
that
his
hearing
rights
would
be
--
his
interests
would
be
quite
small
and
probably
would
not
entitle
him
to
a
hearing,
again
that
decision
doesn't
have
to
be
reached,
but
certainly
no
stigma
would
flow
from
the
failure
to
get
a
job
and
certainly
not
the
same
stigma
that
would
flow
from
being
not
retained
on
the
relocation
problems,
would
not
flow,
from
not
receiving
the
job,
with
lots
of
income
and
income
was
never
coming
in,
but
certainly
not
be
a
direct
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
that's
correct,
we
will
go
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
that's
part
of
that
but
in
addition,
in
this
case
the
reasons
that
were
discovered
did
in
fact
implicate
--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
i
would
say
we
don't
have
to
reach
that
question
and
the
different
bouncing
would
be
undertaken
in
each
case.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
well,
this
court
in
goldberg
did
site
approvingly
the
dickson
case
for
the
fifth
circuit,
i
would
say,
college
student
probably
would
if
those
person
not
ruled
out
it
would
probably
be
entire
--
there
is
a
minimal
due
process
for
court,
he
has
to
leave
and
pointed
back,
one
of
roth's
public
statements
dealt
with
the
fact
that
students
had
been
terminated
without
due
process
and
ironic
twist
that
he
is
here
today
asking
such
rights
for
himself.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
i
think
they
would
have
the
right,
i
think
that
reason
that
you
stated
would
be
a
perfectly
a
legitimate
reason,
i
can't
see
any
logic
behind
a
professor
asserting
his
right
to
a
hearing
in
that
situation.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
yes.
