mr.
john
t.
hansen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
right
of
a
reserve
member
of
the
armed
services
to
obtain
prompt
judicial
review
of
a
decision
by
the
army
denying
his
request
for
conscientious
objector
discharge.
the
case
arises
on
its
particular
facts
which
are
typical
with
those
facts
found
in
unattached
reservists
cases.
the
facts
have
cause
in
decision
below
and
a
conflict
among
the
circuits
with
respect
to
certain
unresolved
question
of
federal
court
jurisdiction.
because
the
facts
are
so
important,
i
would
like
to
elaborate
a
bit
on
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
lieutenant
johnny
strait
who
was
born
and
raised
in
san
francisco,
california
was
a
member
of
the
army
rotc
at
the
university
of
california
at
davis
and
he
received
the
commission
as
a
reserve
second
lieutenant
upon
his
graduation.
although
his
two-year
active
duty
obligation
was
deferred
in
order
that
he
could
go
to
law
school
which
he
did
over
the
next
three
years
in
yale
university.
and
after
graduating
from
law
school,
he
returned
to
his
home
in
san
francisco
in
order
to
take
california
bar
exam
with
army
permission.
and
it
was
while
he
was
at
home
waiting
to
take
the
bar
exam
that
he
had
a
series
of
personal
events
in
his
life
including
a
suicide
of
a
very
close
cousin,
caused
him
to
realize
that
he
held
beliefs
and
conscience
that
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
fulfill
his
military
obligation.
according
to
him,
he
requested
that
he
be
discharged
from
the
army
reserve
on
grounds
of
conscientious
objection.
in
pursuant
to
applicable
army
regulations,
a
series
of
interviews
and
a
hearing
were
held
in
a
fort
ord,
california,
a
large
army
base
near
san
francisco.
the
results
of
those
interviews
in
that
hearing
which
were
favorable
to
lieutenant
strait's
claim
were
forwarded
to
a
board
of
officers
at
the
army
reserve
components
personnel
center
in
indianapolis,
indiana,
where
the
board
concluded
after
reviewing
the
record
that
lieutenant
strait
did
not
meet
the
criteria
of
the
regulation
recommended
against
granting
the
discharge.
he
was
notified
of
that
decision
and
informed
that
he
would
be
required
to
proceed
as
previously
ordered
in
the
week
to
active
duty
at
fort
gordon,
georgia.
mr.
john
t.
hansen
apparently,
although
the
regulation
is
not
specifically
clear
on
this,
that
decision
is
delegated
to
the
commanding
officer
of
the
reserve
components
personnel
center
by
the
secretary
of
the
army.
mr.
john
t.
hansen
yes,
that's
correct.
he
is
the
commander
of
the
--
essentially
of
that
installation
or
that
portion
of
that
installation.
when
he
learned
of
the
adverse
decision,
he
immediately
petitioned
for
review
of
that
action
in
the
federal
district
court
in
san
francisco.
the
government
moved
to
dismiss
on
the
grounds
of
commanding
officer
of
the
reserve
center
that
was
not
present
in
the
district
and
therefore,
the
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction.
that
motion
was
denied
but
the
court
ultimately
on
the
merits
denied
relief
to
the
lieutenant
strait
and
consequently
both
sides
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
ninth
circuit
initially
affirmed
to
district
court's
jurisdictional
finding
but
reversed
it
on
the
merits
finding
unanimously
that
there
was
no
basis
in
fact
in
the
record
to
support
the
army's
denial
of
lieutenant
strait's
request
for
discharge.
shortly
thereafter,
this
court
last
term
decided
the
case
of
schlanger
against
seamans.
now,
on
that
basis,
the
government
petitioned
the
court
of
appeals
for
rehearing
and
that
petition
was
granted
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
authority
of
schlanger,
ordered
the
entire
proceedings
dismissed.
and
that
is
the
decision
which
is
now
before
this
court.
it
raises
a
number
of
questions.
there
are
two
principal
questions.
the
first
is
whether
in
order
for
a
district
court
to
have
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction,
both
the
petitioner
and
his
custodian
must
be
physically
present
in
that
district.
the
second
question
is
whether
habeas
corpus
is
the
only
remedy
available
to
a
serviceman,
seeking
to
obtain
judicial
review
of
a
denial
of
the
request
for
discharge.
that
question
of
course
includes
several
aspects
but
that
is
the
primary
second
issue.
now
with
respect
the
habeas
corpus
issue,
this
court
in
this
context
is
called
upon
to
balance
the
greatness
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
which
relies
on
its
prompt
availability
against
the
territorial
restriction
which
congress
has
placed
on
the
district
court's
to
grant
writs
of
habeas
corpus.
the
restriction
that
is
included
in
the
statute
in
the
following
phrase.
the
district
courts
may
grant
writs
of
habeas
corpus
within
their
respective
jurisdictions.
as
the
government's
contention
here
that
that
phrase
means
that
both
the
petitioner
and
the
custodian
must
be
physically
present
in
the
district
in
order
for
the
court
to
grant
the
writ,
whereas
petitioner
contends
that
as
long
as
he
is
physically
present
in
the
district,
it
is
only
necessarily
that
the
custodian
be
present
jurisdictionally
through
context
that
he
has
had
with
the
petitioner
in
the
district
and
it
is
not
necessary
at
least
in
this
context
and
the
limited
context
that
arises
that
the
custodian
be
physically
present.
now
to
support
this
contention,
we
looked
first
to
the
history
of
the
habeas
corpus
statute
in
this
particular
phrase
which
was
inserted
into
the
statute
and
has
remained
unchanged
in
1867.
the
purpose
of
that
insertion
into
the
statute
at
that
time
was
to
avoid
the
situation
where
petitioners
in
habeas
corpus
proceedings
might
have
to
be
transported
about
around
the
country.
ironically,
the
government's
contention
here
was
that
the
petitioner
must
do
that
very
thing.
he
must
travel
long
distances
across
this
country
before
he
can
invoke
the
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court.
the
problem
that
we
have
in
this
case
with
respect
to
this
particular
phrase
though
arises
because
there
are
new
class
of
habeas
corpus
petitioners
in
this
country
now
as
the
result
of
the
series
of
decisions
of
this
court
which
has
expanded
the
availability
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
to
include
persons
who
are
not
an
actual
physical
complainant
or
not
actually
held
behind
bars.
and
this
class
of
petitioners
may
indeed
be
in
one
district
and
the
custodian
be
in
another
situation
that
was
previously
highly
unlikely
to
ever
arise.
now,
this
court
has
interpreted
this
phrase
in
the
past
in
the
case
of
ahrens
against
clark
and
has
there
concluded
that
a
petitioner
must
indeed
be
physically
present
in
the
district
for
the
district
court
to
have
jurisdiction
and
it
has
not
change
this
ruling
apparently
in
view
of
the
new
class
of
petitioners
that
exist.
but
of
course
that
requirement
is
met
here.
but
there
is
no
question
that
if
the
custodian
must
also
be
physically
present
in
the
district
that
this
will
greatly
restrict
the
availability
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
certainly
to
the
particular
facts
of
petitioners
that
we
have
before
the
court
today,
and
it
is
our
contention
that
this
is
contrary
to
the
purpose
behind
the
phrase
in
the
statute.
it's
contrary
to
the
purposes
of
the
great
writ
that
it
be
properly
available.
it
advances
no
policy
interest
of
the
government.
the
government
benefits
in
no
particular
way
from
this
rule,
and
it
does
create
substantial
hardships
to
the
petitioner.
mr.
john
t.
hansen
not
necessarily
and
there
are
number
of
reasons
why
that
would
be
true.
first
of
all,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
that
petitioner
must
always
meet
himself
the
jurisdictional
and
venue
requirements
before
he
can
invoke
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court.
although
he
may
be
physically
present,
he
may
not
be
a
resident
of
the
district
and
therefore,
the
district
court
may
not
have
venue
over
the
action
or
may
find
that
there
is
a
more
convenient
forum
where
the
action
can
be
heard.
and
then
there
is
a
second
question
as
to
whether
the
custodian
in
that
particular
case
that
you
mentioned
is
jurisdictionally
present
in
the
district
because
from
the
hypothetical
that
you
pose,
i
don't
see
any
contacts
that
the
warden
would
have
had
that
the
petitioner
while
he
was
in
the
district
where
he
had
been
allowed
to
go.
even
if
he
had
had
some
nominal
contacts,
they
certainly
would
not
relate
to
the
subject
matter
of
the
action
that
he
brought.
third,
i
think
the
court
might
have
some
difficulty
serving
process,
but
i
am
not
sure
if
you
were
talking
about
a
federal
prisoner
or
a
state
prisoner
and
we
must
keep
in
mind
that
that's
an
important
distinction
that
arises
in
these
cases.
it
makes
the
rule
that
we
urged
limited
in
its
application
because
it
really
could
arise
only
in
the
situations
where
the
prisoner
is
a
--
where
this
issues
are
federal
issues
and
the
custodian
is
a
federal
officer.
mr.
john
t.
hansen
well,
if
that
is
the
question
before
this
court
--
mr.
john
t.
hansen
from
the
facts
that
you
stated,
i
would
say
that
he
is
not
because
he
did
not
have
contact
with
the
petitioner
while
the
petitioner
was
in
the
distant
district
and
had
not
in
the
sense
entered
that
district.
now
here,
and
this
is
--
mr.
john
t.
hansen
he
would
probably
have
jurisdiction
in
that
district
court
under
section
2255
and
the
question
would
not
arise
that
he
was
convicted
in
that
district
and
he
was
challenging
his
conviction.
if
he
was
challenging
the
conditions
of
his
custody
in
georgia,
then
that
would
be
a
different
question.
but
there,
he
would
have
to
show
that
the
warden
in
georgia
had
somehow
entered
this
district
of
northern
district
of
california
in
order
to
be
subject
to
its
jurisdiction,
and
has
never
been
there
been
i
should
say,
never
but
if
it
is
for
a
long
time,
this
court
has
held
that
it
is
not
necessary
for
a
person
to
be
physically
present
in
the
court's
district
to
be
subject
to
its
jurisdiction
in
other
context
and
i
see
no
reason
considering
the
purposes
behind
the
great
writ,
policies
to
be
serve
including
the
fact,
the
government
is
not
injured
here
and
that
petitioner
is
injured,
why
we
cannot
rely
upon
the
context
theory
in
this
case.
mr.
john
t.
hansen
that's
right.
and
i
think
--
mr.
john
t.
hansen
that's
correct.
mr.
john
t.
hansen
i
know,
there
are
a
number
of
problems
that
arise
from
that.
of
course,
we
treated
this
extensively
in
our
brief
but
i
will
review
them
very
briefly
here.
the
first
is
that
in
this
case
where
you
have
a
military
reservist
who
has
never
been
on
active
duty.
it's
important
to
him
that
he
obtains
a
ruling
before
he
has
done
active
duty.
that's
essentially
the
subject
matter
of
the
case
and
--
mr.
john
t.
hansen
but
the
draftee
has
not
yet
exhausted
his
administrative
remedies,
and
the
draftee
always
has
the
option
of
refusing
to
submit
for
induction
and
never
becoming
subject
to
the
harshness
of
the
military
domain.
mr.
john
t.
hansen
yes,
but
if
he
feels
he
has
a
strong
case
and
that
his
case
is
one
that
is
likely
to
win,
the
risk
may
be
minimum.
secondly,
although
lieutenant
strait
would
go
to
georgia
presumably
at
government
expense,
his
counsel
would
not
go
to
be
paid
for
his
expenses
in
going
to
georgia.
moreover,
his
counsel
would
not
be
familiar
with
the
georgia
courts
and
it
may
be
necessary
to
obtain
other
counsel
from
georgia
in
addition
to
which
there
is
the
time
involved
here,
traveling
back
and
forth
across
country
in
order
to
litigate
cases.
the
only
administrative
procedures
took
place
here
in
san
francisco
and
that's
also
where
local
counsel
is
most
familiar
with
the
case.
it's
not
easy
to
litigate
these
matters
in
federal
court
if
you
have
to
start
a
fashion
or
place
that's
thousands
of
miles
from
your
home
and
counsel.
these
are
not
as
the
government
seems
to
indicate
minor
problems.
they
would
probably
be
insurmountable
problems
to
a
certain
member
of
people.
and
that's
the
problems
that
we
see
with
that
suggestion
on
the
part
of
the
government
and
again,
emphasizing
as
the
second
circuit
did
in
the
case
arlen
against
laird
which
is
cited
in
our
briefs
and
send
direct
conflict
if
the
ninth
circuit
decision
here
expressly
disagrees
with
that.
the
second
circuit
said
that
it's
illogical
if
the
man
must
go
on
active
duty
in
order
to
contest
the
army's
right
to
force
him
to
go
on
active
duty.
it's
sort
of
putting
the
cart
before
the
horse,
and
that's
what
the
petitioner
wants
why
he
wants
prompt
review.
he
doesn't
want
to
have
to
go
on
active
duty
as
these
cases
the
matters
we
discussed
in
our
brief
indicate.
the
court
of
course
must
reconcile
this
case
with
its
decision
why
last
term
in
schlanger
against
seamans
and
we
appeal
that
there
--
it
is
possible
to
decide
this
case
in
favor
of
the
petitioner
without
doing
violence
to
schlanger.
first
of
all
as
i
read
the
reservation
of
the
question
in
the
schlanger
that
the
court
did
not
reach
the
question
of
whether
this
context
that
they
could
be
used
to
obtain
jurisdiction
and
therefore,
if
that
is
question
--
mr.
john
t.
hansen
he
had
been
on
active
duty
for
several
years
and
--
mr.
john
t.
hansen
i
believe,
yes,
he
filed
his
petition
in
the
district
of
arizona
something
like
the
day
before
he
was
suppose
to
be
back
in
georgia.
mr.
john
t.
hansen
well,
i
can't
say
that
he's
never
passed
through
(inaudible)
on
an
airplane
that
that
is
true.
he
is
never
been
in
indiana
for
any
military
purpose,
or
in
georgia,
or
in
any
other
state
really
for
any
other
military
purpose
except
if
you
count
his
attendance
at
yale
law
school
but
for
military
purpose.
but
the
cases
are
distinguishable.
first
the
points
that
mr.
justice
marshall
has
made.
there
is
a
quite
difference
between
the
status
of
the
two
petitioners
at
the
time
they
brought
the
action.
back
to
there
some
question
as
to
whether
sergeant
schlanger
could
even
be
said
to
have
been
a
resident
of
arizona.
he
was
only
there
on
a
very
temporary
leave,
maintained
a
permanent
residence
elsewhere,
had
been
a
member
of
a
active
military
unit
in
georgia
for
several
months
where
he
had
an
actual
commanding
officer,
and
that
commanding
officer
moreover
unlike
lieutenant
strait's
commanding
officer
have
really
had
very
little
to
do
with
him
while
he
was
in
arizona.
that
was
not
the
commanding
officer
that
was
his
commanding
officer
on
the
subject
matter
if
his
suit
arose
that
it
occurred
of
some
year
or
more
before.
he'd
been
under
a
different
command
at
that
time
and
therefore,
his
current
commanding
officer,
the
commanding
officer
of
the
unit
in
georgia
where
he
had
performed
functions
for
nine-month
period
have
really
no
contact
with
him
in
arizona.
that
is
more
analogous
to
the
situation
that
the
chief
justice
previously
posed.
he's
been
allowed
temporarily
to
go
there
for
purposes
totally
unrelated
to
that
action
that
he
was
bringing
at
that
time.
but
more
importantly,
i
think
and
the
overriding
question
in
the
case
is
that
where
you
have
this
new
class
of
only
nominally
restrained
if
at
all
really
petitioners
who
are
in
a
very
highly
technical
form
of
custody.
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
court
to
have
that
closely
contact
with
the
petitioner,
with
the
custodian
because
there
is
no
turned
key
in
this
case.
the
court
does
not
send
a
writ
down
to
the
jail.
the
jailer
looked
at
it
and
then
turned
a
key
and
let
the
man
out
of
the
jail.
in
these
cases,
all
you
need
is
some
kind
of
a
judicial
determination
that
then
becomes
res
judicata
with
respect
to
this
man's
status.
mr.
john
t.
hansen
because
i
think
that
court
answered
that
question
only
last
term,
last
month
excuse
me
in
the
parisi
case
where
it
said
that
the
member
of
the
military
by
virtue
of
his
restraints
as
member
of
the
military
is
entitled
to
prompt
judicial
review
in
habeas
corpus,
and
there
are
number
of
circuit
cases
that
have
found
that
a
reservist
is
in
custody
and
restrained
for
that
purpose.
after
all,
he
can
be
subjected
to
an
order
of
the
military
at
any
moment
in
time.
and
the
question,
i
think
has
already
been
answered
by
this
court
that
this
new
custodian
or
our
new
petitioners
are
in
custody
for
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction
and
the
question
in
this
case
is
where
are
they
in
custody?
i
would
like
to
turn
to
some
of
the
alternative
remedies
that
we
urge
are
available
at
this
time
however
in
answer
to
your
question
and
also
because
of
course
we
are
pushing
them
quite
strongly
in
this
case
in
addition
to
pleading
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court,
lieutenant
strait
urged
that
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction
under
the
federal
mandamus
statute
in
title
28,
section
1361
of
federal
question
statute
to
title
28
section
1331
(a)
and
the
judicial
review
procedures
provisions
of
the
administrative
procedure
act,
and
i
would
like
to
after
the
recess
discuss
this.
mr.
john
t.
hansen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court
again.
i
was
about
to
begin
discussing
our
alternate
theories
to
jurisdiction
other
than
habeas
corpus.
i
would
like
to
first
to
speak
about
the
federal
mandamus
section,
title
28,
section
1361
which
was
passed
by
congress
to
alleviate
the
problem
very
similar
to
that
here.
a
problem
where
persons
who
sought
to
challenge
federal
administrative
action
would
have
to
travel
across
the
country
in
order
to
do
so.
government
contends
however
that
section
1361
is
not
available
here
because
the
decision
under
review
is
discretionary.
that
of
course
merely
begs
the
question.
the
question
is
what
is
a
discretionary
decision?
and
it
is
our
contention
that
an
officer
of
the
federal
government
does
not
have
discretion
to
fail
to
follow
his
own
regulations
and
to
render
an
administrative
decision
contrary
to
those
regulations.
and
that
the
discretion
referred
to
is
that
discretion
contained
in
decisions
of
a
policymaking
or
political
nature,
not
the
kind
of
operational
decision
that
is
present
here.
now,
it's
true
that
the
agency
here
has
to
make
some
fact
finding
and
perhaps
apply
those
facts
to
go
on.
and
if
that
is
certain
amount
of
discretion,
that's
fine.
but
the
section
1361
still
reaches
that
action
for
review
as
chief
justice
tuck
told
us
in
the
case
of
work
against
reeves
over
50
years
ago,
that
although
the
officer's
duty
may
be
discretionary
within
limits,
he
cannot
transgress
those
limits.
and
if
he
does
so,
he
may
be
controlled
by
mandamus.
or
to
put
it
in
other
way
because
this
court
more
recently
said
in
the
panama
canal
case
1958
cited
by
the
respondents,
the
decision
which
cannot
be
reached
is
one
which
is
so
wide
open
and
at
large
as
to
be
left
entirely
to
agency
discretion,
and
this
decision
is
not
wide
open.
there
is
some
substantial
law
of
conscientious
objection
is
to
be
applied
here.
now,
the
findings
and
conclusions
of
the
review
board
almost
on
their
face
violate
the
law
and
regulations
but
the
government
conceded
below
error
in
those
conclusions
and
all
respects
except
one,
and
that
does
the
conclusion
of
lieutenant
strait
is
insincere.
but
the
army
had
found
the
wide
variety
of
failure
to
meet
the
regulatory
criteria
which
are
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
recently
in
welsh
against
united
states,
clay
against
united
states
clearly
erroneous.
and
even
with
respect
to
the
sincerity
question,
there
is
a
lot
to
be
applied.
in
conclusion,
that
a
person
is
insincere
on
the
conscientious
objector
claim
must
be
based
on
facts
in
the
record,
and
moreover,
those
facts
must
be
objective
and
rational
to
reach
that
conclusion.
but
it
was
the
unanimous
opinion
of
the
three-judge
court
of
appeals
that
there
were
so
no
such
facts
in
this
record
that
the
decision
was
without
a
basis
in
fact
in
addition
to
being
legally
erroneous.
so
accordingly,
it
is
quite
clear
in
this
case
that
the
army
failed
to
follow
the
law,
found
in
its
own
regulations
and
interpreted
judicial
decisions.
it
can
hardly
be
denied
that
lieutenant
strait
was
entitled
to
have
his
claim,
reviewed
according
to
the
law,
and
that
the
federal
agents
in
this
case
had
a
duty,
perhaps
a
clear
duty,
one
of
them
ministerial
nature
to
based
their
decision
on
the
law.
and
according
to
the
facts
in
the
record,
the
government
falls
back
from
that
position
then
and
argues
that
well,
in
any
event
section
1361
can't
be
utilized
because
there's
another
remedy,
habeas
corpus
which
can
be
invoke
in
indiana
or
georgia.
we
have
analyzed
the
cases
for
that,
approached
has
been
taken
to
mandamus
jurisdiction
and
have
found
that
where
that
has
been
done,
it
has
been
done
only
for
the
other
remedy.
it
is
one
that
was
created
by
statute
and
has
the
exclusive
remedy
for
the
particular
agreed
action.
moreover,
the
courts
have
always
referred
to
the
other
remedy
as
an
adequate
remedy,
and
of
course
as
our
discussion
under
habeas
corpus
pointed
out
there's
serious
question
as
to
whether
habeas
corpus
in
the
distance
state
in
an
adequate
remedy.
and
there's
even
some
question
however
in
this
case
that
the
time
of
lieutenant
strait
filed
this
petition,
if
we
are
to
accept
the
government's
contentions
that
it
was
even
available
at
that
time,
or
they
contend
lieutenant
strait
had
to
perform
certain
condition
precedent
before
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction
even
existed.
moreover,
they
are
suggestion
defeats
the
very
purposes
behind
section
1361
because
their
result
requires
a
petitioner
to
travel
to
a
distant
state
rather
than
to
be
able
to
bring
the
action
or
he
resides
which
is
what
congress
hoped
to
provide
for
in
section
1361.
in
addition,
we
pleaded
jurisdiction
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
which
we
feel
does
confer
independent
jurisdictions
on
this
court
and
that
this
--
the
district
court
and
if
this
court's
decision
last
term
in
the
overton
park
case
against
volpe,
so
held.
again,
the
discretionary
jurisdiction
question
comes
up,
and
i
think
that
our
answers
under
mandamus
apply
as
well.
finally
with
respect
to
section
1331,
the
question
that
would
have
to
be
resolved
here,
the
only
remaining
question
is
the
meaning
of
the
$10,000.00
jurisdictional
amount
and
we
feel
that
a
claim
of
agency
action
that
validates
due
process
of
law
per
se
meets
that
$10,000.00
jurisdictional
amount
question.
so,
what
we
are
asking
this
court
to
do
today
is
to
approach
this
case
realistically
according
to
the
facts,
policies
underlying
these
decisions
and
not
to
needlessly
restrict.
perhaps,
judicial
review
after
the
army
has
denied
a
request
for
conscientious
objector
discharge.
i
would
like
at
this
time,
if
i
may
to
reserve
my
few
remaining
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
t.
hansen
thank
you.
i
would
like
to
require
the
several
things
that
the
solicitor
general
raised.
first,
with
respect
to
the
custodian,
bringing
the
body
before
the
court,
i
find
this
to
be
a
very
strange
requirement
to
be
elevated
in
this
case
to
preclude
the
district
court
from
jurisdiction
where
the
petitioner
is
already
in
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court,
and
the
custodian
here
has
put
in
years
been
ordering
him
around
and
producing
his
body
by
orders
communicated
to
him
by
mail
in
this
very
same
district.
and,
i
do
not
see
how
it
would
help
the
government
to
have
the
custodian
now
physically
present
in
the
district.
moreover,
under
one
of
their
suggestions
that
he
go
to
indiana
for
a
scintilla
of
time,
establish
jurisdiction
there
and
then
apparently,
go
back
home
to
san
francisco
with
have
the
same
problem.
this
court
has
long
recognized
that
it
is
not
necessary
with
the
custodian
be
physically
able
to
produce
the
body
because
he
is
in
the
district.
i
think
the
endo
case
says
that
when
the
petitioner
has
left
the
district
and
he
is
in
the
custody,
actual
physical
custody
of
some
other
person,
a
custodian
can
still
by
long
distance
produce
the
result
desired,
and
that
is
what
we
urge
here.
i
regret
that
the
solicitor
general
has
raised
the
question
forum
shopping
in
this
case
for
the
first
time
at
this
level.
it
has
never
been
raised
before.
there
is
never
been
a
hint
of
it
in
this
case.
and
the
government
has
never
suggested
that
this
case
would
be
more,
better
brought
in
another
district
for
any
reason
relating
to
forum
shopping.
second
circuit
in
the
arlen
case
rather
summarily
dispose
of
that
suggestion
and
found
it
somewhat
frivolous
that
the
government
had
any
interest
in
having
these
cases
tried
in
the
district
other
than
that
where
the
petitioner
is
residing.
there
just
was
not
forum
shopping
here,
and
if
forum
shopping
arises
in
these
cases
in
the
future,
they
can
be
controlled
by
venue
and
forum
non
conveniens
rulings
not
by
artificial
jurisdictional
rulings.
likewise,
the
suggestion
as
lieutenant
strait
enjoyed
some
kind
of
draft
exemption
because
having
accepted
in
rotc
commission
was
raised
and
then
rejected
by
the
court
of
appeals.
had
lieutenant
strait
not
gone
through
rotc,
not
accepted
this
commission,
he
would
have
been
exempt
from
the
draft
just
the
same
under
with
the
two
(inaudible)
through
college
and
the
hospital
that
he
would
have
been
entitled
too.
as
to
the
apa
on
its
base
eliminating
jurisdiction
where
there
is
another
remedy.
the
solicitor
general
did
not
mention
in
this
court's
decision
of
brownell
against
we
shung
in
1948
where
the
court
permitted
an
immigrant
to
use
the
apa
and
declaratory
relief,
even
though
he
could
have
submitted
himself
to
custody
and
brought
habeas
corpus,
and
he
held
that
either
remedy
was
available.
i
also
find
some
inconsistency
in
the
suggestion
that
the
apa
is
not
a
jurisdictional
statute,
and
yet
also
arguing
that
if
jurisdiction
independently
exists,
the
court
should
not
exercise
the
apa
jurisdiction.
if
apa
jurisdiction
is
not
an
independent
jurisdictional
ground,
then
there
would
always
be
another
remedy,
and
never
any
need
to
use
apa.
i
don't
see
any
problem
either
of
the
court
having
to
reach
the
kinds
of
issues
suggested
by
the
solicitor
general
with
respect
to
serviceman
wanting
to
challenge
their
duty
assignments
or
type
of
training
they
are
getting.
those
are
indeed
policy
decisions
of
the
army
that
do
not
necessarily
relate
to
facts
that
have
been
found
in
administrative
proceedings
that
have
been
held
in
order
to
maybe
indeed
in
those
areas
of
complete
discretion,
and
this
court
has
long
held
that
the
courts
will
not
control
assignments
of
servicemen
to
specific
duty
assignments,
but
that
was
repeatedly
affirmed
to
right
of
man
claiming
that
he
is
illegally
held
in
the
army
to
challenge
the
army's
right
to
continue
to
hold
him.
that
is
what
is
asked
here,
now
the
court
in
mandamus
could
issue
an
order
in
combination
with
the
declaratory
judgment
action.
my
time
is
up
and
thank
you
gentlemen
very
much
and
i
urge
you
to
rule
for
our
petitioner.
mr.
john
t.
hansen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
right
of
a
reserve
member
of
the
armed
services
to
obtain
prompt
judicial
review
of
a
decision
by
the
army
denying
his
request
for
conscientious
objector
discharge.
the
case
arises
on
its
particular
facts
which
are
typical
with
those
facts
found
in
unattached
reservists
cases.
the
facts
have
cause
in
decision
below
and
a
conflict
among
the
circuits
with
respect
to
certain
unresolved
question
of
federal
court
jurisdiction.
because
the
facts
are
so
important,
i
would
like
to
elaborate
a
bit
on
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
lieutenant
johnny
strait
who
was
born
and
raised
in
san
francisco,
california
was
a
member
of
the
army
rotc
at
the
university
of
california
at
davis
and
he
received
the
commission
as
a
reserve
second
lieutenant
upon
his
graduation.
although
his
two-year
active
duty
obligation
was
deferred
in
order
that
he
could
go
to
law
school
which
he
did
over
the
next
three
years
in
yale
university.
and
after
graduating
from
law
school,
he
returned
to
his
home
in
san
francisco
in
order
to
take
california
bar
exam
with
army
permission.
and
it
was
while
he
was
at
home
waiting
to
take
the
bar
exam
that
he
had
a
series
of
personal
events
in
his
life
including
a
suicide
of
a
very
close
cousin,
caused
him
to
realize
that
he
held
beliefs
and
conscience
that
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
fulfill
his
military
obligation.
according
to
him,
he
requested
that
he
be
discharged
from
the
army
reserve
on
grounds
of
conscientious
objection.
in
pursuant
to
applicable
army
regulations,
a
series
of
interviews
and
a
hearing
were
held
in
a
fort
ord,
california,
a
large
army
base
near
san
francisco.
the
results
of
those
interviews
in
that
hearing
which
were
favorable
to
lieutenant
strait's
claim
were
forwarded
to
a
board
of
officers
at
the
army
reserve
components
personnel
center
in
indianapolis,
indiana,
where
the
board
concluded
after
reviewing
the
record
that
lieutenant
strait
did
not
meet
the
criteria
of
the
regulation
recommended
against
granting
the
discharge.
he
was
notified
of
that
decision
and
informed
that
he
would
be
required
to
proceed
as
previously
ordered
in
the
week
to
active
duty
at
fort
gordon,
georgia.
mr.
john
t.
hansen
apparently,
although
the
regulation
is
not
specifically
clear
on
this,
that
decision
is
delegated
to
the
commanding
officer
of
the
reserve
components
personnel
center
by
the
secretary
of
the
army.
mr.
john
t.
hansen
yes,
that's
correct.
he
is
the
commander
of
the
--
essentially
of
that
installation
or
that
portion
of
that
installation.
when
he
learned
of
the
adverse
decision,
he
immediately
petitioned
for
review
of
that
action
in
the
federal
district
court
in
san
francisco.
the
government
moved
to
dismiss
on
the
grounds
of
commanding
officer
of
the
reserve
center
that
was
not
present
in
the
district
and
therefore,
the
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction.
that
motion
was
denied
but
the
court
ultimately
on
the
merits
denied
relief
to
the
lieutenant
strait
and
consequently
both
sides
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
ninth
circuit
initially
affirmed
to
district
court's
jurisdictional
finding
but
reversed
it
on
the
merits
finding
unanimously
that
there
was
no
basis
in
fact
in
the
record
to
support
the
army's
denial
of
lieutenant
strait's
request
for
discharge.
shortly
thereafter,
this
court
last
term
decided
the
case
of
schlanger
against
seamans.
now,
on
that
basis,
the
government
petitioned
the
court
of
appeals
for
rehearing
and
that
petition
was
granted
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
authority
of
schlanger,
ordered
the
entire
proceedings
dismissed.
and
that
is
the
decision
which
is
now
before
this
court.
it
raises
a
number
of
questions.
there
are
two
principal
questions.
the
first
is
whether
in
order
for
a
district
court
to
have
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction,
both
the
petitioner
and
his
custodian
must
be
physically
present
in
that
district.
the
second
question
is
whether
habeas
corpus
is
the
only
remedy
available
to
a
serviceman,
seeking
to
obtain
judicial
review
of
a
denial
of
the
request
for
discharge.
that
question
of
course
includes
several
aspects
but
that
is
the
primary
second
issue.
now
with
respect
the
habeas
corpus
issue,
this
court
in
this
context
is
called
upon
to
balance
the
greatness
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
which
relies
on
its
prompt
availability
against
the
territorial
restriction
which
congress
has
placed
on
the
district
court's
to
grant
writs
of
habeas
corpus.
the
restriction
that
is
included
in
the
statute
in
the
following
phrase.
the
district
courts
may
grant
writs
of
habeas
corpus
within
their
respective
jurisdictions.
as
the
government's
contention
here
that
that
phrase
means
that
both
the
petitioner
and
the
custodian
must
be
physically
present
in
the
district
in
order
for
the
court
to
grant
the
writ,
whereas
petitioner
contends
that
as
long
as
he
is
physically
present
in
the
district,
it
is
only
necessarily
that
the
custodian
be
present
jurisdictionally
through
context
that
he
has
had
with
the
petitioner
in
the
district
and
it
is
not
necessary
at
least
in
this
context
and
the
limited
context
that
arises
that
the
custodian
be
physically
present.
now
to
support
this
contention,
we
looked
first
to
the
history
of
the
habeas
corpus
statute
in
this
particular
phrase
which
was
inserted
into
the
statute
and
has
remained
unchanged
in
1867.
the
purpose
of
that
insertion
into
the
statute
at
that
time
was
to
avoid
the
situation
where
petitioners
in
habeas
corpus
proceedings
might
have
to
be
transported
about
around
the
country.
ironically,
the
government's
contention
here
was
that
the
petitioner
must
do
that
very
thing.
he
must
travel
long
distances
across
this
country
before
he
can
invoke
the
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court.
the
problem
that
we
have
in
this
case
with
respect
to
this
particular
phrase
though
arises
because
there
are
new
class
of
habeas
corpus
petitioners
in
this
country
now
as
the
result
of
the
series
of
decisions
of
this
court
which
has
expanded
the
availability
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
to
include
persons
who
are
not
an
actual
physical
complainant
or
not
actually
held
behind
bars.
and
this
class
of
petitioners
may
indeed
be
in
one
district
and
the
custodian
be
in
another
situation
that
was
previously
highly
unlikely
to
ever
arise.
now,
this
court
has
interpreted
this
phrase
in
the
past
in
the
case
of
ahrens
against
clark
and
has
there
concluded
that
a
petitioner
must
indeed
be
physically
present
in
the
district
for
the
district
court
to
have
jurisdiction
and
it
has
not
change
this
ruling
apparently
in
view
of
the
new
class
of
petitioners
that
exist.
but
of
course
that
requirement
is
met
here.
but
there
is
no
question
that
if
the
custodian
must
also
be
physically
present
in
the
district
that
this
will
greatly
restrict
the
availability
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
certainly
to
the
particular
facts
of
petitioners
that
we
have
before
the
court
today,
and
it
is
our
contention
that
this
is
contrary
to
the
purpose
behind
the
phrase
in
the
statute.
it's
contrary
to
the
purposes
of
the
great
writ
that
it
be
properly
available.
it
advances
no
policy
interest
of
the
government.
the
government
benefits
in
no
particular
way
from
this
rule,
and
it
does
create
substantial
hardships
to
the
petitioner.
mr.
john
t.
hansen
not
necessarily
and
there
are
number
of
reasons
why
that
would
be
true.
first
of
all,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
that
petitioner
must
always
meet
himself
the
jurisdictional
and
venue
requirements
before
he
can
invoke
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court.
although
he
may
be
physically
present,
he
may
not
be
a
resident
of
the
district
and
therefore,
the
district
court
may
not
have
venue
over
the
action
or
may
find
that
there
is
a
more
convenient
forum
where
the
action
can
be
heard.
and
then
there
is
a
second
question
as
to
whether
the
custodian
in
that
particular
case
that
you
mentioned
is
jurisdictionally
present
in
the
district
because
from
the
hypothetical
that
you
pose,
i
don't
see
any
contacts
that
the
warden
would
have
had
that
the
petitioner
while
he
was
in
the
district
where
he
had
been
allowed
to
go.
even
if
he
had
had
some
nominal
contacts,
they
certainly
would
not
relate
to
the
subject
matter
of
the
action
that
he
brought.
third,
i
think
the
court
might
have
some
difficulty
serving
process,
but
i
am
not
sure
if
you
were
talking
about
a
federal
prisoner
or
a
state
prisoner
and
we
must
keep
in
mind
that
that's
an
important
distinction
that
arises
in
these
cases.
it
makes
the
rule
that
we
urged
limited
in
its
application
because
it
really
could
arise
only
in
the
situations
where
the
prisoner
is
a
--
where
this
issues
are
federal
issues
and
the
custodian
is
a
federal
officer.
mr.
john
t.
hansen
well,
if
that
is
the
question
before
this
court
--
mr.
john
t.
hansen
from
the
facts
that
you
stated,
i
would
say
that
he
is
not
because
he
did
not
have
contact
with
the
petitioner
while
the
petitioner
was
in
the
distant
district
and
had
not
in
the
sense
entered
that
district.
now
here,
and
this
is
--
mr.
john
t.
hansen
he
would
probably
have
jurisdiction
in
that
district
court
under
section
2255
and
the
question
would
not
arise
that
he
was
convicted
in
that
district
and
he
was
challenging
his
conviction.
if
he
was
challenging
the
conditions
of
his
custody
in
georgia,
then
that
would
be
a
different
question.
but
there,
he
would
have
to
show
that
the
warden
in
georgia
had
somehow
entered
this
district
of
northern
district
of
california
in
order
to
be
subject
to
its
jurisdiction,
and
has
never
been
there
been
i
should
say,
never
but
if
it
is
for
a
long
time,
this
court
has
held
that
it
is
not
necessary
for
a
person
to
be
physically
present
in
the
court's
district
to
be
subject
to
its
jurisdiction
in
other
context
and
i
see
no
reason
considering
the
purposes
behind
the
great
writ,
policies
to
be
serve
including
the
fact,
the
government
is
not
injured
here
and
that
petitioner
is
injured,
why
we
cannot
rely
upon
the
context
theory
in
this
case.
mr.
john
t.
hansen
that's
right.
and
i
think
--
mr.
john
t.
hansen
that's
correct.
mr.
john
t.
hansen
i
know,
there
are
a
number
of
problems
that
arise
from
that.
of
course,
we
treated
this
extensively
in
our
brief
but
i
will
review
them
very
briefly
here.
the
first
is
that
in
this
case
where
you
have
a
military
reservist
who
has
never
been
on
active
duty.
it's
important
to
him
that
he
obtains
a
ruling
before
he
has
done
active
duty.
that's
essentially
the
subject
matter
of
the
case
and
--
mr.
john
t.
hansen
but
the
draftee
has
not
yet
exhausted
his
administrative
remedies,
and
the
draftee
always
has
the
option
of
refusing
to
submit
for
induction
and
never
becoming
subject
to
the
harshness
of
the
military
domain.
mr.
john
t.
hansen
yes,
but
if
he
feels
he
has
a
strong
case
and
that
his
case
is
one
that
is
likely
to
win,
the
risk
may
be
minimum.
secondly,
although
lieutenant
strait
would
go
to
georgia
presumably
at
government
expense,
his
counsel
would
not
go
to
be
paid
for
his
expenses
in
going
to
georgia.
moreover,
his
counsel
would
not
be
familiar
with
the
georgia
courts
and
it
may
be
necessary
to
obtain
other
counsel
from
georgia
in
addition
to
which
there
is
the
time
involved
here,
traveling
back
and
forth
across
country
in
order
to
litigate
cases.
the
only
administrative
procedures
took
place
here
in
san
francisco
and
that's
also
where
local
counsel
is
most
familiar
with
the
case.
it's
not
easy
to
litigate
these
matters
in
federal
court
if
you
have
to
start
a
fashion
or
place
that's
thousands
of
miles
from
your
home
and
counsel.
these
are
not
as
the
government
seems
to
indicate
minor
problems.
they
would
probably
be
insurmountable
problems
to
a
certain
member
of
people.
and
that's
the
problems
that
we
see
with
that
suggestion
on
the
part
of
the
government
and
again,
emphasizing
as
the
second
circuit
did
in
the
case
arlen
against
laird
which
is
cited
in
our
briefs
and
send
direct
conflict
if
the
ninth
circuit
decision
here
expressly
disagrees
with
that.
the
second
circuit
said
that
it's
illogical
if
the
man
must
go
on
active
duty
in
order
to
contest
the
army's
right
to
force
him
to
go
on
active
duty.
it's
sort
of
putting
the
cart
before
the
horse,
and
that's
what
the
petitioner
wants
why
he
wants
prompt
review.
he
doesn't
want
to
have
to
go
on
active
duty
as
these
cases
the
matters
we
discussed
in
our
brief
indicate.
the
court
of
course
must
reconcile
this
case
with
its
decision
why
last
term
in
schlanger
against
seamans
and
we
appeal
that
there
--
it
is
possible
to
decide
this
case
in
favor
of
the
petitioner
without
doing
violence
to
schlanger.
first
of
all
as
i
read
the
reservation
of
the
question
in
the
schlanger
that
the
court
did
not
reach
the
question
of
whether
this
context
that
they
could
be
used
to
obtain
jurisdiction
and
therefore,
if
that
is
question
--
mr.
john
t.
hansen
he
had
been
on
active
duty
for
several
years
and
--
mr.
john
t.
hansen
i
believe,
yes,
he
filed
his
petition
in
the
district
of
arizona
something
like
the
day
before
he
was
suppose
to
be
back
in
georgia.
mr.
john
t.
hansen
well,
i
can't
say
that
he's
never
passed
through
(inaudible)
on
an
airplane
that
that
is
true.
he
is
never
been
in
indiana
for
any
military
purpose,
or
in
georgia,
or
in
any
other
state
really
for
any
other
military
purpose
except
if
you
count
his
attendance
at
yale
law
school
but
for
military
purpose.
but
the
cases
are
distinguishable.
first
the
points
that
mr.
justice
marshall
has
made.
there
is
a
quite
difference
between
the
status
of
the
two
petitioners
at
the
time
they
brought
the
action.
back
to
there
some
question
as
to
whether
sergeant
schlanger
could
even
be
said
to
have
been
a
resident
of
arizona.
he
was
only
there
on
a
very
temporary
leave,
maintained
a
permanent
residence
elsewhere,
had
been
a
member
of
a
active
military
unit
in
georgia
for
several
months
where
he
had
an
actual
commanding
officer,
and
that
commanding
officer
moreover
unlike
lieutenant
strait's
commanding
officer
have
really
had
very
little
to
do
with
him
while
he
was
in
arizona.
that
was
not
the
commanding
officer
that
was
his
commanding
officer
on
the
subject
matter
if
his
suit
arose
that
it
occurred
of
some
year
or
more
before.
he'd
been
under
a
different
command
at
that
time
and
therefore,
his
current
commanding
officer,
the
commanding
officer
of
the
unit
in
georgia
where
he
had
performed
functions
for
nine-month
period
have
really
no
contact
with
him
in
arizona.
that
is
more
analogous
to
the
situation
that
the
chief
justice
previously
posed.
he's
been
allowed
temporarily
to
go
there
for
purposes
totally
unrelated
to
that
action
that
he
was
bringing
at
that
time.
but
more
importantly,
i
think
and
the
overriding
question
in
the
case
is
that
where
you
have
this
new
class
of
only
nominally
restrained
if
at
all
really
petitioners
who
are
in
a
very
highly
technical
form
of
custody.
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
court
to
have
that
closely
contact
with
the
petitioner,
with
the
custodian
because
there
is
no
turned
key
in
this
case.
the
court
does
not
send
a
writ
down
to
the
jail.
the
jailer
looked
at
it
and
then
turned
a
key
and
let
the
man
out
of
the
jail.
in
these
cases,
all
you
need
is
some
kind
of
a
judicial
determination
that
then
becomes
res
judicata
with
respect
to
this
man's
status.
mr.
john
t.
hansen
because
i
think
that
court
answered
that
question
only
last
term,
last
month
excuse
me
in
the
parisi
case
where
it
said
that
the
member
of
the
military
by
virtue
of
his
restraints
as
member
of
the
military
is
entitled
to
prompt
judicial
review
in
habeas
corpus,
and
there
are
number
of
circuit
cases
that
have
found
that
a
reservist
is
in
custody
and
restrained
for
that
purpose.
after
all,
he
can
be
subjected
to
an
order
of
the
military
at
any
moment
in
time.
and
the
question,
i
think
has
already
been
answered
by
this
court
that
this
new
custodian
or
our
new
petitioners
are
in
custody
for
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction
and
the
question
in
this
case
is
where
are
they
in
custody?
i
would
like
to
turn
to
some
of
the
alternative
remedies
that
we
urge
are
available
at
this
time
however
in
answer
to
your
question
and
also
because
of
course
we
are
pushing
them
quite
strongly
in
this
case
in
addition
to
pleading
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court,
lieutenant
strait
urged
that
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction
under
the
federal
mandamus
statute
in
title
28,
section
1361
of
federal
question
statute
to
title
28
section
1331
(a)
and
the
judicial
review
procedures
provisions
of
the
administrative
procedure
act,
and
i
would
like
to
after
the
recess
discuss
this.
mr.
john
t.
hansen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court
again.
i
was
about
to
begin
discussing
our
alternate
theories
to
jurisdiction
other
than
habeas
corpus.
i
would
like
to
first
to
speak
about
the
federal
mandamus
section,
title
28,
section
1361
which
was
passed
by
congress
to
alleviate
the
problem
very
similar
to
that
here.
a
problem
where
persons
who
sought
to
challenge
federal
administrative
action
would
have
to
travel
across
the
country
in
order
to
do
so.
government
contends
however
that
section
1361
is
not
available
here
because
the
decision
under
review
is
discretionary.
that
of
course
merely
begs
the
question.
the
question
is
what
is
a
discretionary
decision?
and
it
is
our
contention
that
an
officer
of
the
federal
government
does
not
have
discretion
to
fail
to
follow
his
own
regulations
and
to
render
an
administrative
decision
contrary
to
those
regulations.
and
that
the
discretion
referred
to
is
that
discretion
contained
in
decisions
of
a
policymaking
or
political
nature,
not
the
kind
of
operational
decision
that
is
present
here.
now,
it's
true
that
the
agency
here
has
to
make
some
fact
finding
and
perhaps
apply
those
facts
to
go
on.
and
if
that
is
certain
amount
of
discretion,
that's
fine.
but
the
section
1361
still
reaches
that
action
for
review
as
chief
justice
tuck
told
us
in
the
case
of
work
against
reeves
over
50
years
ago,
that
although
the
officer's
duty
may
be
discretionary
within
limits,
he
cannot
transgress
those
limits.
and
if
he
does
so,
he
may
be
controlled
by
mandamus.
or
to
put
it
in
other
way
because
this
court
more
recently
said
in
the
panama
canal
case
1958
cited
by
the
respondents,
the
decision
which
cannot
be
reached
is
one
which
is
so
wide
open
and
at
large
as
to
be
left
entirely
to
agency
discretion,
and
this
decision
is
not
wide
open.
there
is
some
substantial
law
of
conscientious
objection
is
to
be
applied
here.
now,
the
findings
and
conclusions
of
the
review
board
almost
on
their
face
violate
the
law
and
regulations
but
the
government
conceded
below
error
in
those
conclusions
and
all
respects
except
one,
and
that
does
the
conclusion
of
lieutenant
strait
is
insincere.
but
the
army
had
found
the
wide
variety
of
failure
to
meet
the
regulatory
criteria
which
are
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
recently
in
welsh
against
united
states,
clay
against
united
states
clearly
erroneous.
and
even
with
respect
to
the
sincerity
question,
there
is
a
lot
to
be
applied.
in
conclusion,
that
a
person
is
insincere
on
the
conscientious
objector
claim
must
be
based
on
facts
in
the
record,
and
moreover,
those
facts
must
be
objective
and
rational
to
reach
that
conclusion.
but
it
was
the
unanimous
opinion
of
the
three-judge
court
of
appeals
that
there
were
so
no
such
facts
in
this
record
that
the
decision
was
without
a
basis
in
fact
in
addition
to
being
legally
erroneous.
so
accordingly,
it
is
quite
clear
in
this
case
that
the
army
failed
to
follow
the
law,
found
in
its
own
regulations
and
interpreted
judicial
decisions.
it
can
hardly
be
denied
that
lieutenant
strait
was
entitled
to
have
his
claim,
reviewed
according
to
the
law,
and
that
the
federal
agents
in
this
case
had
a
duty,
perhaps
a
clear
duty,
one
of
them
ministerial
nature
to
based
their
decision
on
the
law.
and
according
to
the
facts
in
the
record,
the
government
falls
back
from
that
position
then
and
argues
that
well,
in
any
event
section
1361
can't
be
utilized
because
there's
another
remedy,
habeas
corpus
which
can
be
invoke
in
indiana
or
georgia.
we
have
analyzed
the
cases
for
that,
approached
has
been
taken
to
mandamus
jurisdiction
and
have
found
that
where
that
has
been
done,
it
has
been
done
only
for
the
other
remedy.
it
is
one
that
was
created
by
statute
and
has
the
exclusive
remedy
for
the
particular
agreed
action.
moreover,
the
courts
have
always
referred
to
the
other
remedy
as
an
adequate
remedy,
and
of
course
as
our
discussion
under
habeas
corpus
pointed
out
there's
serious
question
as
to
whether
habeas
corpus
in
the
distance
state
in
an
adequate
remedy.
and
there's
even
some
question
however
in
this
case
that
the
time
of
lieutenant
strait
filed
this
petition,
if
we
are
to
accept
the
government's
contentions
that
it
was
even
available
at
that
time,
or
they
contend
lieutenant
strait
had
to
perform
certain
condition
precedent
before
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction
even
existed.
moreover,
they
are
suggestion
defeats
the
very
purposes
behind
section
1361
because
their
result
requires
a
petitioner
to
travel
to
a
distant
state
rather
than
to
be
able
to
bring
the
action
or
he
resides
which
is
what
congress
hoped
to
provide
for
in
section
1361.
in
addition,
we
pleaded
jurisdiction
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
which
we
feel
does
confer
independent
jurisdictions
on
this
court
and
that
this
--
the
district
court
and
if
this
court's
decision
last
term
in
the
overton
park
case
against
volpe,
so
held.
again,
the
discretionary
jurisdiction
question
comes
up,
and
i
think
that
our
answers
under
mandamus
apply
as
well.
finally
with
respect
to
section
1331,
the
question
that
would
have
to
be
resolved
here,
the
only
remaining
question
is
the
meaning
of
the
$10,000.00
jurisdictional
amount
and
we
feel
that
a
claim
of
agency
action
that
validates
due
process
of
law
per
se
meets
that
$10,000.00
jurisdictional
amount
question.
so,
what
we
are
asking
this
court
to
do
today
is
to
approach
this
case
realistically
according
to
the
facts,
policies
underlying
these
decisions
and
not
to
needlessly
restrict.
perhaps,
judicial
review
after
the
army
has
denied
a
request
for
conscientious
objector
discharge.
i
would
like
at
this
time,
if
i
may
to
reserve
my
few
remaining
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
t.
hansen
thank
you.
i
would
like
to
require
the
several
things
that
the
solicitor
general
raised.
first,
with
respect
to
the
custodian,
bringing
the
body
before
the
court,
i
find
this
to
be
a
very
strange
requirement
to
be
elevated
in
this
case
to
preclude
the
district
court
from
jurisdiction
where
the
petitioner
is
already
in
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court,
and
the
custodian
here
has
put
in
years
been
ordering
him
around
and
producing
his
body
by
orders
communicated
to
him
by
mail
in
this
very
same
district.
and,
i
do
not
see
how
it
would
help
the
government
to
have
the
custodian
now
physically
present
in
the
district.
moreover,
under
one
of
their
suggestions
that
he
go
to
indiana
for
a
scintilla
of
time,
establish
jurisdiction
there
and
then
apparently,
go
back
home
to
san
francisco
with
have
the
same
problem.
this
court
has
long
recognized
that
it
is
not
necessary
with
the
custodian
be
physically
able
to
produce
the
body
because
he
is
in
the
district.
i
think
the
endo
case
says
that
when
the
petitioner
has
left
the
district
and
he
is
in
the
custody,
actual
physical
custody
of
some
other
person,
a
custodian
can
still
by
long
distance
produce
the
result
desired,
and
that
is
what
we
urge
here.
i
regret
that
the
solicitor
general
has
raised
the
question
forum
shopping
in
this
case
for
the
first
time
at
this
level.
it
has
never
been
raised
before.
there
is
never
been
a
hint
of
it
in
this
case.
and
the
government
has
never
suggested
that
this
case
would
be
more,
better
brought
in
another
district
for
any
reason
relating
to
forum
shopping.
second
circuit
in
the
arlen
case
rather
summarily
dispose
of
that
suggestion
and
found
it
somewhat
frivolous
that
the
government
had
any
interest
in
having
these
cases
tried
in
the
district
other
than
that
where
the
petitioner
is
residing.
there
just
was
not
forum
shopping
here,
and
if
forum
shopping
arises
in
these
cases
in
the
future,
they
can
be
controlled
by
venue
and
forum
non
conveniens
rulings
not
by
artificial
jurisdictional
rulings.
likewise,
the
suggestion
as
lieutenant
strait
enjoyed
some
kind
of
draft
exemption
because
having
accepted
in
rotc
commission
was
raised
and
then
rejected
by
the
court
of
appeals.
had
lieutenant
strait
not
gone
through
rotc,
not
accepted
this
commission,
he
would
have
been
exempt
from
the
draft
just
the
same
under
with
the
two
(inaudible)
through
college
and
the
hospital
that
he
would
have
been
entitled
too.
as
to
the
apa
on
its
base
eliminating
jurisdiction
where
there
is
another
remedy.
the
solicitor
general
did
not
mention
in
this
court's
decision
of
brownell
against
we
shung
in
1948
where
the
court
permitted
an
immigrant
to
use
the
apa
and
declaratory
relief,
even
though
he
could
have
submitted
himself
to
custody
and
brought
habeas
corpus,
and
he
held
that
either
remedy
was
available.
i
also
find
some
inconsistency
in
the
suggestion
that
the
apa
is
not
a
jurisdictional
statute,
and
yet
also
arguing
that
if
jurisdiction
independently
exists,
the
court
should
not
exercise
the
apa
jurisdiction.
if
apa
jurisdiction
is
not
an
independent
jurisdictional
ground,
then
there
would
always
be
another
remedy,
and
never
any
need
to
use
apa.
i
don't
see
any
problem
either
of
the
court
having
to
reach
the
kinds
of
issues
suggested
by
the
solicitor
general
with
respect
to
serviceman
wanting
to
challenge
their
duty
assignments
or
type
of
training
they
are
getting.
those
are
indeed
policy
decisions
of
the
army
that
do
not
necessarily
relate
to
facts
that
have
been
found
in
administrative
proceedings
that
have
been
held
in
order
to
maybe
indeed
in
those
areas
of
complete
discretion,
and
this
court
has
long
held
that
the
courts
will
not
control
assignments
of
servicemen
to
specific
duty
assignments,
but
that
was
repeatedly
affirmed
to
right
of
man
claiming
that
he
is
illegally
held
in
the
army
to
challenge
the
army's
right
to
continue
to
hold
him.
that
is
what
is
asked
here,
now
the
court
in
mandamus
could
issue
an
order
in
combination
with
the
declaratory
judgment
action.
my
time
is
up
and
thank
you
gentlemen
very
much
and
i
urge
you
to
rule
for
our
petitioner.
