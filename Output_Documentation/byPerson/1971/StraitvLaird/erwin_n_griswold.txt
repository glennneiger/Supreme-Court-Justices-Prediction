mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
presented
here
is
a
very
narrow
one.
simply
whether
there
was
a
custodian
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
and
whether
the
presence
of
a
custodian
within
the
jurisdiction
is
a
prerequisite
to
relief
under
habeas
corpus
or
under
and
maybe
other
statutory
provisions
to
which
mr.
hansen
has
referred.
we
do
not
contend
here
that
lieutenant
strait
was
not
"in
custody",
although
it
is
clear
that
to
say
that
he
was
in
custody
represents
a
considerable
enlargement
of
the
habeas
corpus
concept
over
what
it
has
had
traditionally
and
historically.
because
there
is
a
conflict
of
decision,
we
have
brief
the
question
rather
fully.
it
is
clear
of
course
that
historically,
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
was
based
on
territorial
considerations
and
that
has
been
particularly
true
and
its
history
in
the
united
states
where
the
form
of
the
statute
is
one
directed
to
a
person
who
is
required
to
produce
the
person
of
the
applicant.
after
all,
it
is
habeas
corpus
in
a
second
person,
you
have
the
body
and
the
all
force
of
the
writ
is
that
it
is
directed
against
somebody
who
is
the
custodian
of
the
person
who
is
in
custody.
we
recognized
that
the
great
writ
has
been
expanded
and
extended
in
decisions
of
the
court.
we
find
it
somewhat
difficult
to
think
that
it
should
be
so
attenuated
and
so
diluted
that
the
basic
purpose
of
the
writ
becomes
forgotten.
i
would
hope
we
would
not
get
to
the
place
where
we
talk
about
a
remedy
and
say
it
finds
its
origin
in
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
which
was
very
important
in
the
early
days.
it
is
seems
to
me
that
the
great
writ
should
be
retained
with
its
traditional
limitations
and
so
far
as
that
remains
appropriate
and
in
so
far
as
it
is
required
by
the
statute
enacted
by
congress.
i
know
that
maitland
said
that
the,
forms
of
actions
rules
from
the
grave,
but
nevertheless
our
position
is
that
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
is
not
merely
a
device
for
writing
it
wrong.
for
example,
as
i
sat
here
on
monday
listening
to
the
argument
in
the
flood
case
and
thinking
about
the
argument
today,
i
have
found
myself
wondering
whether
the
flood
case
could
not
have
been
presented
to
this
court
as
the
habeas
corpus
case.
there
you
had
a
person
in
custody
because
obviously,
his
freedom
is
restrained.
he
could
not
play
baseball
in
any
place
in
the
united
states,
mexico
or
japan.
you
had
a
custodian.
i
should
think
it
would
be
hardly
undesirable
to
approach
that
case
in
terms
of
habeas
corpus,
and
i
think
it
is
equally
undesirable
here
in
the
absence
of
action
by
congress
to
eliminate
by
judicial
action
the
requirement
in
the
statute
that
there
be
a
custodian
within
the
territorial
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
this
may
seem
technical,
but
our
concern
is
in
part
the
question
of
foreign
shopping,
it's
perfectly
true
that
lieutenant
strait
is
a
long
time
resident
of
the
northern
district
of
california,
but
the
northern
district
of
california
is
statistically
a
good
place
for
seeking
discharge
on
the
grounds
of
conscientious
objection
and
it
can
be
understandable
why
he
would
prefer
to
sue
there
rather
than
in
some
other
jurisdiction.
the
statute
itself
as
i
have
said
which
is
quoted
on
pages
41
and
42
of
our
brief
provides
that
the
writ
or
order
to
show
cause
shall
be
directed
to
the
person
having
custody
of
the
person
detained.
and
then
it
proceeds
farther
down
on
the
page,
the
person
to
whom
the
writ
is
directed
shall
be
required
to
produce
at
the
hearing,
the
body
of
the
person
as
detained.
as
we
read
the
statute
and
understand
the
case,
the
issue
before
the
court
is
squarely
and
directly
covered
by
this
court's
decision
is
schlanger
against
seamans
which
was
announced
that
just
a
year
ago,
tomorrow,
march
23,
1971
where
the
court
denied
sergeant
schlanger's
effort
to
get
habeas
corpus
through
a
court
in
arizona
by
saying
that
the
district
court
in
arizona
has
no
custodian
within
its
reach
against
whom
its
writ
can
run.
the
officer
in
georgia
is
an
officer
of
the
united
states.
he
could
be
served
outside
the
jurisdiction
under
section
1391
(a)
just
as
much
as
the
colonel
in
indianapolis
can
be
served
here,
but
the
court
decided
just
a
year
ago
what
the
court
in
arizona
has
not
custodian
within
its
reach
against
whom
its
writ
can
run
and
then
continued
that
the
absence
of
his
custodian
is
fatal
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
arizona
court.
incidentally,
i
may
say
that
sergeant
schlanger
is
now
out
of
the
air
force
and
has
been
in
touch
with
me
about
getting
admitted
to
a
law
school.
the
decision
which
is
in
conflict
with
the
present
case
is
the
decision
of
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
arlen
against
laird.
we
think
that
the
basis
of
the
conflict
is
rather
patently
on
the
face
of
the
opinion
due
to
a
misunderstanding.
the
court
said,
the
supreme
court
reserved
decision
on
this
precise
question,
but
i
think
if
the
opinions
are
examined,
it
is
apparent
that
the
issue
which
was
reserved
was
whether
the
special
type
for
reservist
in
this
situation
who
is
not
assigned
to
any
unit
is
"in
custody."
that
was
what
was
really
involved
in
the
donigian
case
and
that
is
the
issue
which
is
considered
here.
the
question
is
whether
the
custodian
is
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
and
whether
that
is
required
and
our
position
is
that
that
is
exactly
the
issue
which
was
faced
in
schlanger
and
exactly
the
issue
which
the
court
decided
in
what
seemed
to
us
to
be
unequivocal
terms.
now
here,
there
are
what
seem
to
me
to
be
reasonable
alternatives
for
lieutenant
strait.
he
can
do
what
sergeant
schlanger
did.
following
this
court's
decision,
sergeant
schlanger
filed
suit
for
habeas
corpus
in
the
district
court
in
georgia,
and
then
when
he
had
been
transferred
to
iceland,
he
started
the
suit
in
the
courts
of
the
district
of
columbia.
lieutenant
strait
can
wait
until
he
reports
for
active
duty
in
georgia
whereas
has
been
indicated
his
transportation
cost
to
georgia
will
be
paid,
and
he
can
then
immediately
file
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus.
there
is
a
suggestion
that
there
is
a
terrible
burden,
a
very
great
distinction
between
his
being
in
the
inactive
reserve
and
his
is
being
on
active
duty.
the
fact
is
however
that
he
is
in
the
army
and
now
and
has
been
in
the
army
for
a
number
of
years,
and
he
can
raise
in
the
georgia
court
in
completeness
all
of
the
questions
which
he
seeks
to
raise.
however,
if
it
is
really
important
for
him
that
he
not
go
on
active
duty
and
i
repeat,
i
find
it
difficult
to
see
why
it
really
is
important,
i
can
understand
why
some
kind
of
conscientious
objector
might
say
i
cannot
be
in
the
army
at
all,
and
therefore
i
cannot
take
the
alternative
of
accepting
induction
and
then
applying
for
habeas
corpus,
but
lieutenant
strait
is
in
the
army
and
has
been
in
the
army
for
years.
but
if
it
is
important
to
him
that
he
not
have
to
be
in
the
army
on
an
active
duty
status,
he
can
sue
in
it
was
indiana.
it
is
now
missouri.
the
suggestion
is
made
that
this
will
swamp
the
courts
in
that
state
because
there
are
that
is
said
seven
million
reservists.
the
overwhelming
proportion
of
those
however
are
men
who
have
completed
their
military
service
who
are
subject
to
call
only
in
the
event
of
the
gravest
national
emergency,
and
as
stated
in
our
brief,
there
are
only
13,000
all
together
of
these
unattached
reservists
in
the
army.
during
the
year
1971,
they
produced
a
total
of
84
conscientious
objector
claims
of
which
39
where
decided
adversely,
which
seems
to
be
the
total
pool
from
which
the
potential
number
of
habeas
corpus
cases
of
this
kind
can
be
drawn
on
an
annual
basis.
with
respect
to
his
suing
in
georgia,
i
think
it
can
appropriately
be
pointed
out
that
he
entered
the
army
voluntarily.
it
is
said
that
it
is
a
hardship
to
him
to
have
to
sue
in
georgia
but
hardship
is
a
relative
matter.
he
has
obtained
many
years
of
draft
exemption
by
being
in
the
rotc,
and
then
having
it
extended
for
law
school
education.
if
he
had
been
drafted
and
found
to
be
a
conscientious
objector,
he
would
have
had
two
years
of
alternative
service.
i
assumed
that
he
is
now
over
26
year
old
and
that
that
risk
would
not
be
applicable.
and
so
on
the
road
which
he
has
followed,
he
has
had
the
best
of
both
ways.
he
has
had
benefits
from
military
service,
but
he
would
not
have
to
perform
on
active
duty
or
the
alternative
service
which
a
conscientious
objector
ordinarily
has
to
perform.
with
respect
to
habeas
corpus,
we
think
the
soul
issue
is
the
question
with
respect
to
the
presence
of
the
custodian
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
and
that
that
issue
was
squarely
covered
by
this
court's
decision
in
the
schlanger
case.
now,
it
is
suggested
that
the
petition
in
the
district
court
in
this
case
was
very
broadly
drawn
and
presents
numerous
other
basis
of
jurisdiction
other
than
that
of
habeas
corpus.
for
example,
the
administrative
procedure
act
is
advanced.
but
there,
it
is
seems
to
me
that
the
act
itself
contains
the
answer
to
its
applicability,
quite
apart
from
other
questions.
the
act
is
quoted
on
page
39
of
our
brief.
it
is
title
5
united
states
code,
section
704
and
it
begins
agency
action
made
reviewable
by
statute
and
final
agency
action
for
which
there
is
no
other
adequate
remedy
in
a
court.
and
here,
we
submit
that
there
is
a
clear
and
adequate
remedy
in
the
court
now
in
missouri
or
in
the
court
in
georgia
after
lieutenant
strait
responds
to
his
orders
to
report
for
active
duty.
we
would
further
submit
that
the
administrative
procedure
act
is
not
itself
a
basis
for
federal
court
jurisdiction.
i
toyed
with
that
thought
myself
or
thought
seriously
about
it
in
connection
with
the
preparation
of
this
case,
but
it
is
i
am
sure,
a
pandora's
box
if
the
court
starts
down
that
road,
then
any
serviceman
who
is
ordered
transferred
from
fort
meade
marilyn
to
afford
some
place
in
texas
can
present
the
question
to
court
whether
that
transfer
was
proper,
and
a
serviceman
who
is
ordered
to
undergo
training
to
become
an
auto
mechanic
could
equally
raise
the
same
issue
in
court,
and
that
it
seems
to
me
quite
clearly
would
not
be
an
appropriate
construction
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
with
respect
to
a
suit
for
a
declaratory
judgment,
the
jurisdictional
basis
in
the
court
would
be
section
1331
(a).
there
is
there
a
$10,000.00
jurisdictional
amount.
i
know
that
the
courts
have
not
been
very
happy
about
that
and
have
found
ways
to
decide
cases
without
dealing
with
that.
but
after
all,
that
is
the
jurisdictional
limitation
which
congress
put
into
the
statute.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
should
not
be
simply
overlooked
or
ignored.
here,
habeas
corpus
is
available.
it
is
the
appropriate
remedy,
and
it
should
be
the
exclusive
remedy.
and
finally,
it
is
contended
on
behalf
of
lieutenant
strait
that
mandamus
would
be
a
remedy.
mandamus
to
do
what
is
isn't
entirely
clear
to
me
or
who
should
do
what.
the
colonel
at
fort
benjamin
harrison
is
the
only
officer
of
the
army
who
has
issued
an
order
to
lieutenant
strait,
and
incidentally,
we
have
printed
as
the
final
appendix
of
our
brief,
the
army
regulation
which
deals
with
the
persons
and
the
inactive
reserve
which
provides
explicitly
that
the
officer
in
command
of
the
reserve
officer
personnel
center
should
be
the
officer
in
command
of
these
people.
all
of
the
court
with
mandamus
is
to
order
the
government
officer
to
do
his
duty.
but
here,
the
duty
of
the
officers
was
to
decide
the
question
with
respect
lieutenant
strait's
conscientious
objection
and
the
officers
have
decided.
they
may
have
decided
it
wrong,
but
it
is
not
the
function
of
mandamus
to
review
and
revise
decisions
which
people
have
made
in
performance
of
their
duty.
that
was
precisely
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
case
of
sanders,
michael
against
mccarl
and
291
u.s.
442
where
the
chief
of
finance
of
the
army
had
sought
an
advanced
ruling
from
the
comptroller
general
and
the
comptroller
general
had
made
that
ruling.
mandamus
was
unsought
against
the
comptroller
general,
and
the
court
decided
that
mandamus
would
not
apply
because
the
comptroller
general's
duty
was
to
rule
and
he
had
ruled.
the
court
also
decided
that
mandamus
could
lie
against
the
chief
of
finance
of
the
army
because
they
concluded
that
the
ruling
was
wrong
and
that
the
chief
of
finance
of
the
army
was
not
justified
in
complying
with
the
comptroller
general's
decision.
with
respect
to
the
justiciability
of
an
issue
like
this
in
mandamus,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court's
decision
yesterday
in
the
fine
case
is
highly
relevant.
and
that
of
course
was
not
a
mandamus
case.
that
was
a
question
whether
there
could
be
an
injunction
under
section
against
the
restraint
of
section
10
(b)
(3).
that
field
has
become
somewhat
complicated
between
a
strike
and
brain
make
that
cases
on
the
one
side
in
clark
and
gabriel
and
now
the
fine
case
and
the
laird
case
on
the
other.
but
the
line
it
seems
to
me
is
the
same
as
the
line
involved
with
respect
to
the
applicability
of
mandamus.
that
is
whether
there
is
a
controversial
issue
of
fact
which
needs
to
be
decided,
and
then
the
fine
case
as
in
clark
and
gabriel
involving
conscientious
objection,
it
was
held
that
that
was
such
an
issue
that
it
was
not
appropriate
to
disregard
section
10
(b)
(3),
and
i
should
think
that
by
a
parallel
line
of
argument,
it
was
such
an
issue
i
should
not
be
held
to
be
a
basis
for
that
summary
order
to
do
lay
clear
duty
which
is
the
underlying
basis
for
the
grant
of
writ
of
mandamus.
and
for
these
reasons,
we
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
presented
here
is
a
very
narrow
one.
simply
whether
there
was
a
custodian
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
and
whether
the
presence
of
a
custodian
within
the
jurisdiction
is
a
prerequisite
to
relief
under
habeas
corpus
or
under
and
maybe
other
statutory
provisions
to
which
mr.
hansen
has
referred.
we
do
not
contend
here
that
lieutenant
strait
was
not
"in
custody",
although
it
is
clear
that
to
say
that
he
was
in
custody
represents
a
considerable
enlargement
of
the
habeas
corpus
concept
over
what
it
has
had
traditionally
and
historically.
because
there
is
a
conflict
of
decision,
we
have
brief
the
question
rather
fully.
it
is
clear
of
course
that
historically,
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
was
based
on
territorial
considerations
and
that
has
been
particularly
true
and
its
history
in
the
united
states
where
the
form
of
the
statute
is
one
directed
to
a
person
who
is
required
to
produce
the
person
of
the
applicant.
after
all,
it
is
habeas
corpus
in
a
second
person,
you
have
the
body
and
the
all
force
of
the
writ
is
that
it
is
directed
against
somebody
who
is
the
custodian
of
the
person
who
is
in
custody.
we
recognized
that
the
great
writ
has
been
expanded
and
extended
in
decisions
of
the
court.
we
find
it
somewhat
difficult
to
think
that
it
should
be
so
attenuated
and
so
diluted
that
the
basic
purpose
of
the
writ
becomes
forgotten.
i
would
hope
we
would
not
get
to
the
place
where
we
talk
about
a
remedy
and
say
it
finds
its
origin
in
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
which
was
very
important
in
the
early
days.
it
is
seems
to
me
that
the
great
writ
should
be
retained
with
its
traditional
limitations
and
so
far
as
that
remains
appropriate
and
in
so
far
as
it
is
required
by
the
statute
enacted
by
congress.
i
know
that
maitland
said
that
the,
forms
of
actions
rules
from
the
grave,
but
nevertheless
our
position
is
that
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
is
not
merely
a
device
for
writing
it
wrong.
for
example,
as
i
sat
here
on
monday
listening
to
the
argument
in
the
flood
case
and
thinking
about
the
argument
today,
i
have
found
myself
wondering
whether
the
flood
case
could
not
have
been
presented
to
this
court
as
the
habeas
corpus
case.
there
you
had
a
person
in
custody
because
obviously,
his
freedom
is
restrained.
he
could
not
play
baseball
in
any
place
in
the
united
states,
mexico
or
japan.
you
had
a
custodian.
i
should
think
it
would
be
hardly
undesirable
to
approach
that
case
in
terms
of
habeas
corpus,
and
i
think
it
is
equally
undesirable
here
in
the
absence
of
action
by
congress
to
eliminate
by
judicial
action
the
requirement
in
the
statute
that
there
be
a
custodian
within
the
territorial
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
this
may
seem
technical,
but
our
concern
is
in
part
the
question
of
foreign
shopping,
it's
perfectly
true
that
lieutenant
strait
is
a
long
time
resident
of
the
northern
district
of
california,
but
the
northern
district
of
california
is
statistically
a
good
place
for
seeking
discharge
on
the
grounds
of
conscientious
objection
and
it
can
be
understandable
why
he
would
prefer
to
sue
there
rather
than
in
some
other
jurisdiction.
the
statute
itself
as
i
have
said
which
is
quoted
on
pages
41
and
42
of
our
brief
provides
that
the
writ
or
order
to
show
cause
shall
be
directed
to
the
person
having
custody
of
the
person
detained.
and
then
it
proceeds
farther
down
on
the
page,
the
person
to
whom
the
writ
is
directed
shall
be
required
to
produce
at
the
hearing,
the
body
of
the
person
as
detained.
as
we
read
the
statute
and
understand
the
case,
the
issue
before
the
court
is
squarely
and
directly
covered
by
this
court's
decision
is
schlanger
against
seamans
which
was
announced
that
just
a
year
ago,
tomorrow,
march
23,
1971
where
the
court
denied
sergeant
schlanger's
effort
to
get
habeas
corpus
through
a
court
in
arizona
by
saying
that
the
district
court
in
arizona
has
no
custodian
within
its
reach
against
whom
its
writ
can
run.
the
officer
in
georgia
is
an
officer
of
the
united
states.
he
could
be
served
outside
the
jurisdiction
under
section
1391
(a)
just
as
much
as
the
colonel
in
indianapolis
can
be
served
here,
but
the
court
decided
just
a
year
ago
what
the
court
in
arizona
has
not
custodian
within
its
reach
against
whom
its
writ
can
run
and
then
continued
that
the
absence
of
his
custodian
is
fatal
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
arizona
court.
incidentally,
i
may
say
that
sergeant
schlanger
is
now
out
of
the
air
force
and
has
been
in
touch
with
me
about
getting
admitted
to
a
law
school.
the
decision
which
is
in
conflict
with
the
present
case
is
the
decision
of
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
arlen
against
laird.
we
think
that
the
basis
of
the
conflict
is
rather
patently
on
the
face
of
the
opinion
due
to
a
misunderstanding.
the
court
said,
the
supreme
court
reserved
decision
on
this
precise
question,
but
i
think
if
the
opinions
are
examined,
it
is
apparent
that
the
issue
which
was
reserved
was
whether
the
special
type
for
reservist
in
this
situation
who
is
not
assigned
to
any
unit
is
"in
custody."
that
was
what
was
really
involved
in
the
donigian
case
and
that
is
the
issue
which
is
considered
here.
the
question
is
whether
the
custodian
is
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
and
whether
that
is
required
and
our
position
is
that
that
is
exactly
the
issue
which
was
faced
in
schlanger
and
exactly
the
issue
which
the
court
decided
in
what
seemed
to
us
to
be
unequivocal
terms.
now
here,
there
are
what
seem
to
me
to
be
reasonable
alternatives
for
lieutenant
strait.
he
can
do
what
sergeant
schlanger
did.
following
this
court's
decision,
sergeant
schlanger
filed
suit
for
habeas
corpus
in
the
district
court
in
georgia,
and
then
when
he
had
been
transferred
to
iceland,
he
started
the
suit
in
the
courts
of
the
district
of
columbia.
lieutenant
strait
can
wait
until
he
reports
for
active
duty
in
georgia
whereas
has
been
indicated
his
transportation
cost
to
georgia
will
be
paid,
and
he
can
then
immediately
file
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus.
there
is
a
suggestion
that
there
is
a
terrible
burden,
a
very
great
distinction
between
his
being
in
the
inactive
reserve
and
his
is
being
on
active
duty.
the
fact
is
however
that
he
is
in
the
army
and
now
and
has
been
in
the
army
for
a
number
of
years,
and
he
can
raise
in
the
georgia
court
in
completeness
all
of
the
questions
which
he
seeks
to
raise.
however,
if
it
is
really
important
for
him
that
he
not
go
on
active
duty
and
i
repeat,
i
find
it
difficult
to
see
why
it
really
is
important,
i
can
understand
why
some
kind
of
conscientious
objector
might
say
i
cannot
be
in
the
army
at
all,
and
therefore
i
cannot
take
the
alternative
of
accepting
induction
and
then
applying
for
habeas
corpus,
but
lieutenant
strait
is
in
the
army
and
has
been
in
the
army
for
years.
but
if
it
is
important
to
him
that
he
not
have
to
be
in
the
army
on
an
active
duty
status,
he
can
sue
in
it
was
indiana.
it
is
now
missouri.
the
suggestion
is
made
that
this
will
swamp
the
courts
in
that
state
because
there
are
that
is
said
seven
million
reservists.
the
overwhelming
proportion
of
those
however
are
men
who
have
completed
their
military
service
who
are
subject
to
call
only
in
the
event
of
the
gravest
national
emergency,
and
as
stated
in
our
brief,
there
are
only
13,000
all
together
of
these
unattached
reservists
in
the
army.
during
the
year
1971,
they
produced
a
total
of
84
conscientious
objector
claims
of
which
39
where
decided
adversely,
which
seems
to
be
the
total
pool
from
which
the
potential
number
of
habeas
corpus
cases
of
this
kind
can
be
drawn
on
an
annual
basis.
with
respect
to
his
suing
in
georgia,
i
think
it
can
appropriately
be
pointed
out
that
he
entered
the
army
voluntarily.
it
is
said
that
it
is
a
hardship
to
him
to
have
to
sue
in
georgia
but
hardship
is
a
relative
matter.
he
has
obtained
many
years
of
draft
exemption
by
being
in
the
rotc,
and
then
having
it
extended
for
law
school
education.
if
he
had
been
drafted
and
found
to
be
a
conscientious
objector,
he
would
have
had
two
years
of
alternative
service.
i
assumed
that
he
is
now
over
26
year
old
and
that
that
risk
would
not
be
applicable.
and
so
on
the
road
which
he
has
followed,
he
has
had
the
best
of
both
ways.
he
has
had
benefits
from
military
service,
but
he
would
not
have
to
perform
on
active
duty
or
the
alternative
service
which
a
conscientious
objector
ordinarily
has
to
perform.
with
respect
to
habeas
corpus,
we
think
the
soul
issue
is
the
question
with
respect
to
the
presence
of
the
custodian
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
and
that
that
issue
was
squarely
covered
by
this
court's
decision
in
the
schlanger
case.
now,
it
is
suggested
that
the
petition
in
the
district
court
in
this
case
was
very
broadly
drawn
and
presents
numerous
other
basis
of
jurisdiction
other
than
that
of
habeas
corpus.
for
example,
the
administrative
procedure
act
is
advanced.
but
there,
it
is
seems
to
me
that
the
act
itself
contains
the
answer
to
its
applicability,
quite
apart
from
other
questions.
the
act
is
quoted
on
page
39
of
our
brief.
it
is
title
5
united
states
code,
section
704
and
it
begins
agency
action
made
reviewable
by
statute
and
final
agency
action
for
which
there
is
no
other
adequate
remedy
in
a
court.
and
here,
we
submit
that
there
is
a
clear
and
adequate
remedy
in
the
court
now
in
missouri
or
in
the
court
in
georgia
after
lieutenant
strait
responds
to
his
orders
to
report
for
active
duty.
we
would
further
submit
that
the
administrative
procedure
act
is
not
itself
a
basis
for
federal
court
jurisdiction.
i
toyed
with
that
thought
myself
or
thought
seriously
about
it
in
connection
with
the
preparation
of
this
case,
but
it
is
i
am
sure,
a
pandora's
box
if
the
court
starts
down
that
road,
then
any
serviceman
who
is
ordered
transferred
from
fort
meade
marilyn
to
afford
some
place
in
texas
can
present
the
question
to
court
whether
that
transfer
was
proper,
and
a
serviceman
who
is
ordered
to
undergo
training
to
become
an
auto
mechanic
could
equally
raise
the
same
issue
in
court,
and
that
it
seems
to
me
quite
clearly
would
not
be
an
appropriate
construction
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
with
respect
to
a
suit
for
a
declaratory
judgment,
the
jurisdictional
basis
in
the
court
would
be
section
1331
(a).
there
is
there
a
$10,000.00
jurisdictional
amount.
i
know
that
the
courts
have
not
been
very
happy
about
that
and
have
found
ways
to
decide
cases
without
dealing
with
that.
but
after
all,
that
is
the
jurisdictional
limitation
which
congress
put
into
the
statute.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
should
not
be
simply
overlooked
or
ignored.
here,
habeas
corpus
is
available.
it
is
the
appropriate
remedy,
and
it
should
be
the
exclusive
remedy.
and
finally,
it
is
contended
on
behalf
of
lieutenant
strait
that
mandamus
would
be
a
remedy.
mandamus
to
do
what
is
isn't
entirely
clear
to
me
or
who
should
do
what.
the
colonel
at
fort
benjamin
harrison
is
the
only
officer
of
the
army
who
has
issued
an
order
to
lieutenant
strait,
and
incidentally,
we
have
printed
as
the
final
appendix
of
our
brief,
the
army
regulation
which
deals
with
the
persons
and
the
inactive
reserve
which
provides
explicitly
that
the
officer
in
command
of
the
reserve
officer
personnel
center
should
be
the
officer
in
command
of
these
people.
all
of
the
court
with
mandamus
is
to
order
the
government
officer
to
do
his
duty.
but
here,
the
duty
of
the
officers
was
to
decide
the
question
with
respect
lieutenant
strait's
conscientious
objection
and
the
officers
have
decided.
they
may
have
decided
it
wrong,
but
it
is
not
the
function
of
mandamus
to
review
and
revise
decisions
which
people
have
made
in
performance
of
their
duty.
that
was
precisely
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
case
of
sanders,
michael
against
mccarl
and
291
u.s.
442
where
the
chief
of
finance
of
the
army
had
sought
an
advanced
ruling
from
the
comptroller
general
and
the
comptroller
general
had
made
that
ruling.
mandamus
was
unsought
against
the
comptroller
general,
and
the
court
decided
that
mandamus
would
not
apply
because
the
comptroller
general's
duty
was
to
rule
and
he
had
ruled.
the
court
also
decided
that
mandamus
could
lie
against
the
chief
of
finance
of
the
army
because
they
concluded
that
the
ruling
was
wrong
and
that
the
chief
of
finance
of
the
army
was
not
justified
in
complying
with
the
comptroller
general's
decision.
with
respect
to
the
justiciability
of
an
issue
like
this
in
mandamus,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court's
decision
yesterday
in
the
fine
case
is
highly
relevant.
and
that
of
course
was
not
a
mandamus
case.
that
was
a
question
whether
there
could
be
an
injunction
under
section
against
the
restraint
of
section
10
(b)
(3).
that
field
has
become
somewhat
complicated
between
a
strike
and
brain
make
that
cases
on
the
one
side
in
clark
and
gabriel
and
now
the
fine
case
and
the
laird
case
on
the
other.
but
the
line
it
seems
to
me
is
the
same
as
the
line
involved
with
respect
to
the
applicability
of
mandamus.
that
is
whether
there
is
a
controversial
issue
of
fact
which
needs
to
be
decided,
and
then
the
fine
case
as
in
clark
and
gabriel
involving
conscientious
objection,
it
was
held
that
that
was
such
an
issue
that
it
was
not
appropriate
to
disregard
section
10
(b)
(3),
and
i
should
think
that
by
a
parallel
line
of
argument,
it
was
such
an
issue
i
should
not
be
held
to
be
a
basis
for
that
summary
order
to
do
lay
clear
duty
which
is
the
underlying
basis
for
the
grant
of
writ
of
mandamus.
and
for
these
reasons,
we
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
should
be
affirmed.
