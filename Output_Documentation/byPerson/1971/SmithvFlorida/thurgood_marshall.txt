justice
thurgood
marshall
why
did
you
say
that
man
wandering
around
in
the
street
day
or
night
with
the
object
in
his
mind
that
if
i
see
of
coward
piece,
then
i
must
steal
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
stigma
to
two
instead
of
one
conviction.
justice
thurgood
marshall
right,
do
you
think
people
measure
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
speculate
too
much.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
says
i
will
not
have
man
convicted
or
breaking
in
to
box
car,
especially
since
he
was
also
convicted
at
disorderly
conduct.
do
you
think
that
is
normal?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
bailey
have
done
is
being
viewed
that
is
the
man
served
the
15
people
i
thin
with
your
number
that
is
going
over
to
rob
a
box
car.
and
he
goes
down
the
street
and
go
to
church
he
get
convicted?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
walking
down
the
street
and
he
cannot
prove
them
with
on
his
mind
(inaudible).
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
can
you
convict
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
can
you
convict
them
on
what
in
his
mind?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
did
you
get
out
of
his
mind
in
to
the
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now
we
got
a
circumstance
and
evidence
on
top
of
an
ambiguous
statute.
where
will
that
lead
us?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
do
you
know
when
you
see
man
walking
down
the
street
that
he
is
violating
a
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
can
take
a
lot
of
help
from
the
old
cases.
my
second
point
is
you
when
the
concurrent
sentence
came
up.
he
knew
he
is
going
to
get
a
concurrent
sentence,
did
not
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
did
you
suggest
count
one.
why
did
you
leave
it
in
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
why
do
you
leave
that
as
conviction?
for
what
purpose?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
even
after
that,
why
did
you
insist
on
leaving
both
charges
at
the
end?
it
was
because
you
wanted
him
to
be
--
have
some
effect
on
his
future
did
you
not.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean
the
state
of
florida,
that
is
the
state
of
florida
prosecutor.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
is
it
the
reason
that
you
wanted
them
to
have
two
strikes
on
him.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
i
am
talking—
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible).
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
i
get
the
impression
as
to
now
that
he
wanted
to
have
(inaudible).
and
you
have
to
identify
some
reason
for
having
to
convict
him.
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
that
is
the
law
of
florida,
the
law
of
florida
but
what
is
the
federal
law
on
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
double
jeopardy.
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
two
or
one,
count
two
or
count
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
they
also
have
objection
to
statute.
justice
thurgood
marshall
charge
with
that
too
--
.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
possible
under
florida
law,
he
could
have
convicted
on
all
three
counts.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
see
nothing
wrong
with
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
they
are
called
separate
crimes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
bailey
do
you
know
that
this
case
is
made
of
crime,
for
someone
to
have
a
man’s
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
an
act
here
is
walking.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
agree,
that
is
walking.
justice
thurgood
marshall
certainly
the
person
has
a
right
to
walk.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
so
the
crime
is
really
what
is
in
his
mind.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
see
nothing
wrong
with
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
would
submit
that
committing
a
crime
of
rape
has
a
different
legal
status
from
right
to
walking
down
the
street.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
there
is
a
“different
from
walking
down
the
street”.
this
is
man
is
convicted
of
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
a
lot
of
people
can
and
it
is
up
to
the
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
arrest
him,
he
does
not
know
what
is
in
his
mind
and
he
is
honest
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
in
that
case,
you
just
gave
your
hypothetical
of
the
man
about
to
rob
the
bank
the
next
day.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
are
in
ohio,
you
could
arrest
him,
they
did
not
say,
you
could
convict
from
being
out
on
the
street.
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
he
was
arrested
in
terry
of
carrying
a
gun.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
he
has
a
right
to
question.
justice
thurgood
marshall
tell
him
down.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
say
it
is
a
great
prevention
of
crime
why
not
lock
up
all
those
people.
and
do
not
give
them
trial
of
anything
that
is
preventive
too
was
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
put
them
--
they
cannot
simply.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
do
not
think
you
have
to
go
that
far
to
win
your
point,
i
do
not
think
you
have
the
go
that
far.
justice
thurgood
marshall
your
point
is
that
in
this
statute,
if
the
state
can
prove
that
you
had
the
intent,
you
can
get
convicted.
that
is
all
you
have
to
argued?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
how
could
he
get
arrested,
when
he
was
abroad.
police
is
not
going
to
go
in
his
house
and
look
for
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
has
to
prove
he
is
abroad,
your
argument
is,
if
you
can
prove
his
intent
then
it
follows
the
statute.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
do
not
say
he
is
thinking
up
on
general
principles.
justice
thurgood
marshall
not,
you
are
not
arguing
that
at
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
what
i
am
saying.
justice
thurgood

why
did
