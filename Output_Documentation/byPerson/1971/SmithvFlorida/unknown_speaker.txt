unknown
speaker
what
was
the
purpose?
unknown
speaker
mr.
hubbart
did
you
think
that
the
state
of
florida
could
validly
legislate
in
making
an
offense
to
wander
around
the
railroad
yard
when
one
has
no
business
taking
in
there?
unknown
speaker
and
what
is
the
argument
that
they
will
without
lawful
any
lawful
person,
purpose
or
object?
unknown
speaker
i
just
wanted
what
was
the
states—
unknown
speaker
how
it
proves
if
that
was
--
that
they
were
without
a
lawful
purpose
around
this
place.
unknown
speaker
counsel
what
if
the
--
what
the
two
counts
here?
unknown
speaker
oh
what
was
the
first
count?
unknown
speaker
and
we
are
talking
about
car
road.
unknown
speaker
well
the
states
proves
certainly,
on
the
count
two,
certainly
whether
it
is
explicit--
unknown
speaker
they
claimed
an
unlawful
purpose.
unknown
speaker
to
proved
but
unlawful
purpose.
unknown
speaker
is
that
something
different?
unknown
speaker
by
the
way
was
there
--
the
there
was
a
sentence
on
the
count
two.
unknown
speaker
36
six
months?
unknown
speaker
and
direct
concurrently?
unknown
speaker
has
he
been
serving?
unknown
speaker
so
there
were
concurrent
sentences?
unknown
speaker
and
you
do
not
challenge
that?
unknown
speaker
why
should
we
reach
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
under
which
--
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understand
but
the
sentences
were
concurring.
do
you
think
that
you
would
not
appeal
in
count
two,
prevents
us
to
following
our
concurring
sentence.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that
but
you
do
not
see
any
problem
here
about
--
.
unknown
speaker
can
i
just
ask
you,
it
is
not
clear
as
to
go
back
at
the
moment
did
you
say
he
had
served
his
sentence?
unknown
speaker
is
it
six
months.
unknown
speaker
and
the
six
months
on
count
two.
unknown
speaker
and
any
collateral
consequences
to
his
conviction
on
count
one?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
question
with
their
counsel
that
someone
when
there
was
a
who
--
if
you
believed
the
police
officer
in
this
case
there
was
an
attempt
to
break
in
a
freight
car,
no
one
would
have
any
doubt
but
with
without
lawful
purpose
would
apply
to
this
--
unknown
speaker
i
mean
anybody
would
understand
that
would
they?
it
means
anything,
it
means
you
should
not
be
around
with
the
purpose
of
robbing
a
freight
car.
unknown
speaker
and
not
--
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
why,
without
lawful
purpose?
unknown
speaker
or—
unknown
speaker
to
know
that
being
on
the
street
for
the
purpose
of
robbing
a
freight
car
is
not
covered
by
the
statute.
you
would
know
that?
unknown
speaker
why
did
you
say
that?
unknown
speaker
no
is
that
unlawful
to
rob
a
freight
car,
does
it
not?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
to
attempt
to
and
you
suggest
that
he
really
would
not
know
that
that
statute
which
says
he
should
be
on
his
feet
with
unlawful
purpose
includes
being
on
the
street
for
the
purpose
of
robbing
a
freight
car?
unknown
speaker
i
know
but—
unknown
speaker
i
understand,
i
understand
that
but
here
facts
are
lot
of
vague
statutes,
they
are
vague
in
some
applications
and
not
another—
unknown
speaker
that
any—
unknown
speaker
why
not
robbing
a
freight
car?
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
question
whether
it
is
essential
but
the
question
is
whether
it
is
unconstitutional.
unknown
speaker
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
if
this
statute
were
worded
the
way
the
respondents
would
have
us
read
and
i
am
saying
that
just
on
the
basis
of
the
respondent's
brief,
as
thought
it
said,
as
though
it
made
it
unlawful
for
a
person
to
wander
from
place
to
place
with
a
criminal
purpose,
with
a
criminal
purpose,
would
it
be
unconstitutionally
vague?
unknown
speaker
you
have
a
weaker
argument.
unknown
speaker
then
wandering
had
a
criminal
--
unknown
speaker
it
is
certainly
the
crime
of
attempt
has
been
upheld
and
that
crime
of
conspiracy
has
been
upheld
even
though
the
act
for
the
conspiracy
is
never
realized.
unknown
speaker
this
is
walking
to
a
private
building
and
rob
an
apartment.
unknown
speaker
is
the
construction
of
this
phrase
without
any
lawful
purpose
or
object
contained
in
the
case
of
hanks
against
state.
unknown
speaker
the
only
judicial
construction
of
those
words—
unknown
speaker
imparted
the
prohibitions.
unknown
speaker
yes
i
just
heard.
unknown
speaker
with
what
provisions
does
the
constitution
says
that
--
.
unknown
speaker
i
gather
what
justice
marshall
is
suggesting
of
a
specific
statute
and
if
you
are
wandering
around
with
a
purpose
in
mind
of
stealing
a
car
to
find
keys
on
it.
i
gather
that
is
the
phrasing
of
the
statute.
what
is
in
the
constitution
says
the
state
cannot
make
that
a
crime?
unknown
speaker
i
would
think
that
in
independent
ground
that
you
could
argue
here,
as
this
most--
you
cannot
be
on
the
streets
with
an
unlawful
purpose.
unknown
speaker
same
thing.
unknown
speaker
are
you
making
a
argument
then,
the
state,
the
criminal
law
just
may
not
either
be
interpose
this
consistently
with
the
due
process?
unknown
speaker
that
is
substantive
argument.
unknown
speaker
you
have
to
be
pretty
normal
to
realize
that
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
well
i
should
say,
if
the
state
may
constitutionally,
if
(inaudible)
unlawful
purpose
or
object,
doubles
there
for
the
purpose
of
robbing
a
freight
car,
i
think
yes,that
he
knows
he
is
violating
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
i
know
you
do
not.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
before
you
sit
down.
getting
back
to
what
justice
white
asked
you
earlier.
this
conviction
in
front
of
this
statute,
he
got
36
days
you
said.
what
might
have
been
his
punishment?
unknown
speaker
what
might
have
been,
what
the
maximum.
unknown
speaker
six
months.
on
the
florida
law
may
that
conviction
be
used
in
a
recidivist
situation
do
you
know.
unknown
speaker
but
if
he
used
on
impeachment,
if
you
took
the
stand.
unknown
speaker
some
latter
case
either
civil
of
criminal
charge.
unknown
speaker
civil
or
criminal.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
other
disability
from
this
conviction
that
might
follow?
unknown
speaker
yes,
that
affects
his
right
to
vote.
unknown
speaker
how
about
employment?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
an
employer
is
having
the
hold
of
recruiting
him?
unknown
speaker
the
state
would
not
employ
him.
unknown
speaker
you
say
would
not
but
there
is
not
any
law
which
says
they
could
not
--
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
law
disqualifying
him
from
any
kind
of
position
or
employment
matter.
unknown
speaker
i
am
just
wondering
why
is
the
case
moot?
unknown
speaker
yes
but
he
served
his
time
and
the
i
think
that
sometimes
has
considerable
affect,
if
there
is
no
real
disability
to
travel
from
--
unknown
speaker
well,
then
what
would
you
suggest
then?
unknown
speaker
but
is
that
not
pretty
close
to
the
situation
you
have
here
justice
marshall's
hypothesis?
unknown
speaker
mr.
bailey,
may
i
ask,
this
practice
in
florida
--
what
you
have
it
is
the
same
conduct
right?
unknown
speaker
and,
that
this
petition
two,
the
identical
conduct
was
made
the
subject
of
two
different
counts.
unknown
speaker
is
that
a
practice,
that
you
follow
up
on
florida?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
i
asked
you,
what
happened
here
was
the
identical
conduct
was
made
the
subject
the
two
different
counts.
unknown
speaker
and
he
is
convicted
on
both.
unknown
speaker
different
elements?
unknown
speaker
why?
the
essential
element
i
gather
was
the
unlawful
purpose
element
of
this
statute
was
satisfied
by
the
attempt
to
break
in
the
box
car
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
you
relied
on.
unknown
speaker
and
without
that
would
you
convict
him,
without
that
proof
under
that
statute.
unknown
speaker
why?
so
let
us
say,
so
you
have
made
the
same
conduct,
the
identical
conduct
attempting
to
break
in
the
box
car.
the
subject
of
two,
prosecution
for
two
offenses.
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
did
not
have
the
proof
that
he
attempted
to
break
in
the
box
car,
could
never
have
convicted.
unknown
speaker
that
is
right,
well,
once
did
tape
attempting
to
break
in
to
the
box
car
and
you
made
it
the
subject
of
two
offenses.
you
gave
it
two
convictions
on
two
separate
things.
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
you
did,
i
am
talking
about
what
happened
in
this
case
if
i
understand
it
right.
unknown
speaker
i
asked
you
what
the
practice
was
in
florida,
is
that
what
you
do?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that
was
a
federal
question.
unknown
speaker
double
jeopardy.
unknown
speaker
the
time
of
federal
law.
unknown
speaker
of
florida
law.
unknown
speaker
now,
you
are
arguing
this
case,
that
is
not
the
argument
here
--.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bailey,
let
me
follow
through
on
justice
brennan's
question,
do
you
bring
the
two
charges
because
you
are
not
sure
how
far
your
evidence
will
take
you?
unknown
speaker
but
you
have
no
eye
witness
here
on
the
act
--
unknown
speaker
but
is
that
why
the
point
is
that
under
florida
law
he
was
found
guilty
of
two
separate
offenses
--
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
an
offense
that
a
lesser
included
offenses,
two
separate
offenses.
unknown
speaker
so
i
have
the
same
basic
transaction,
that
is
a
perfectly
rationale
and
a
legitimate
position
to
take
it
seems
to
me.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bailey,
i
may
ask
that
the
state
have
a
reason
not
to
urge
on
this
if
we
ought
not
reach
the
constitutional
question
here
as
to
a
concurrent
sentence?
unknown
speaker
the
concurrent
sentences.
unknown
speaker
when
he
served
one
--
unknown
speaker
these
are
being
decided
to
avoid
the
kind
of
this
offense?
unknown
speaker
well
apparently
if
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine
applies
here,
we
can
avoid
decision
of
the
constitutional
question.
it
would
be
rather
we
not
avoid
it
but
decide
it
even
if
you
could
have
urged
it.
unknown
speaker
you
did
not
say
that,
you
have
concurrent
sentences
here
do
you
not?
unknown
speaker
and
he
served
one
of
them.
unknown
speaker
served
both.
unknown
speaker
before,
even
on
the
count
one.
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
only
one
we
are
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
why
you
would
sure
or
not.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
whatever
disqualification
he
has
flow
from
count
two
and
nothing
more
from
count
one.
unknown
speaker
that
is
not
the
way
that
language
has
been
construed
by
the
only
court
that
has
construed
it,
as
we
are
told.
the
intermediate
appellate
court
of
hanks
against
states,
which
said
that
without
any
lawful
purpose
or
object
simply
meant
without
good
or
sufficient
reason
and
that
is
quite
different
from
saying
an
unlawful
purpose.
unknown
speaker
and
as
you
know,
we
have
to
take,
we
have
no
choice
but
to
take
the
construction
of
a
state
statute
given
to
it
by
the
state
courts
as
the
authoritative
construction.
unknown
speaker
well
that
is
what
the
statute
does
say
--
.
unknown
speaker
they
tell
us
that
is
what
the
statute
says
--.
unknown
speaker
no,
also
it
is
federal
criminal
law,
they
are
not
where
the
criminality
depends
upon
the
man's
purpose
when
he
travels
at
a
state.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
purpose
or
intent.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
state
has
the
constitutional
power
that
a
person
be
on
the
street
with
a
--
to
be
on
the
street
with
a
criminal
intent.
unknown
speaker
no,
even
though
you
--
he
has
not
committed
any
crime
yet
--
he
has
not
attempted
to
commit
any
crime
yet
--
unknown
speaker
but
he
intends
to,
do
you
think
that
is
enough.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that
but
what
about,
do
you
think
that
the
state
police
power
reaches
back
that
far
in
to
the
incubation
of
the
crime.
unknown
speaker
this
count
has
not
been
in
the
statute
anyway
--
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
the
only
example
statutes
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
purpose?
unknown
speaker
mr.
hubbart
did
you
think
that
the
state
of
florida
could
validly
legislate
in
making
an
offense
to
wander
around
the
railroad
yard
when
one
has
no
business
taking
in
there?
unknown
speaker
and
what
is
the
argument
that
they
will
without
lawful
any
lawful
person,
purpose
or
object?
unknown
speaker
i
just
wanted
what
was
the
states—
unknown
speaker
how
it
proves
if
that
was
--
that
they
were
without
a
lawful
purpose
around
this
place.
unknown
speaker
counsel
what
if
the
--
what
the
two
counts
here?
unknown
speaker
oh
what
was
the
first
count?
unknown
speaker
and
we
are
talking
about
car
road.
unknown
speaker
well
the
states
proves
certainly,
on
the
count
two,
certainly
whether
it
is
explicit--
unknown
speaker
they
claimed
an
unlawful
purpose.
unknown
speaker
to
proved
but
unlawful
purpose.
unknown
speaker
is
that
something
different?
unknown
speaker
by
the
way
was
there
--
the
there
was
a
sentence
on
the
count
two.
unknown
speaker
36
six
months?
unknown
speaker
and
direct
concurrently?
unknown
speaker
has
he
been
serving?
unknown
speaker
so
there
were
concurrent
sentences?
unknown
speaker
and
you
do
not
challenge
that?
unknown
speaker
why
should
we
reach
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
under
which
--
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understand
but
the
sentences
were
concurring.
do
you
think
that
you
would
not
appeal
in
count
two,
prevents
us
to
following
our
concurring
sentence.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that
but
you
do
not
see
any
problem
here
about
--
.
unknown
speaker
can
i
just
ask
you,
it
is
not
clear
as
to
go
back
at
the
moment
did
you
say
he
had
served
his
sentence?
unknown
speaker
is
it
six
months.
unknown
speaker
and
the
six
months
on
count
two.
unknown
speaker
and
any
collateral
consequences
to
his
conviction
on
count
one?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
question
with
their
counsel
that
someone
when
there
was
a
who
--
if
you
believed
the

why,

to

that
being

for
the

of
robbing
a

is
not
covered
by

you
would
know
that?
unknown
speaker
why
did
you
say
that?
unknown
speaker
no
is
that
unlawful
to
rob
a
freight
car,
does
it
not?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
to
attempt
to
and
you
suggest
that

there

with

would
it
be
unconstitutionally
vague?
unknown
speaker
you
have
a
weaker
argument.
unknown
speaker
then
wandering
had
a
criminal
--
unknown
speaker
it
is
certainly
the
crime
of
attempt
has
been
upheld
and
that
crime
of
conspiracy
has
been
upheld
even
though
the
act
for
the
conspiracy
is
never
realized.
unknown
speaker
this
is
walking
to
a
private
building
and
rob
an
apartment.
unknown
speaker
is
the
construction
of
this
phrase
without
any
lawful
purpose
or
object
contained
in
the
case
of
hanks
against
state.
unknown
speaker
the
only
judicial
construction
of
those
words—
unknown
speaker
imparted
the
prohibitions.
unknown
speaker
yes
i
just
heard.
unknown
speaker
with
what
provisions
does
the
constitution
says
that
--
.
unknown
speaker
i
gather
what
justice
marshall
is
suggesting
of
a
specific
statute
and
if
you
are
wandering
around
with
a
purpose
in
mind
of
stealing
a
car
to
find
keys
on
it.
i
gather
that
is
the
phrasing
of
the
statute.
what
is
in
the
constitution
says
the
state
cannot
make
that
a
crime?
unknown
speaker
i
would
think
that
in
independent
ground
that
you
could
argue
here,
as
this
most--
you
cannot
be
on
the
streets
with
an
unlawful
purpose.
unknown
speaker
same
thing.
unknown
speaker
are
you
making
a
argument
then,
the
state,
the
criminal
law
just
may
not
either
be
interpose
this
consistently
with
the
due
process?
unknown
speaker
that
is
substantive
argument.
unknown
speaker
you
have
to
be
pretty
normal
to
realize
that
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
well
i
should
say,
if
the
state
may
constitutionally,
if
(inaudible)
unlawful
purpose
or
object,
doubles
there
for
the
purpose
of
robbing
a
freight
car,
i
think
yes,that
he
knows
he
is
violating
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
i
know
you
do
not.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
before
you
sit
down.
getting
back
to
what
justice
white
asked
you
earlier.
this
conviction
in
front
of
this
statute,
he
got
36
days
you
said.
what
might
have
been
his
punishment?
unknown
speaker
what
might
have
been,
what
the
maximum.
unknown
speaker
six
months.
on
the
florida
law
may
that
conviction
be
used
in
a
recidivist
situation
do
you
know.
unknown
speaker
but
if
he
used
on
impeachment,
if
you
took
the
stand.
unknown
speaker
some
latter
case
either
civil
of
criminal
charge.
unknown
speaker
civil
or
criminal.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
other
disability
from
this
conviction
that
might
follow?
unknown
speaker
yes,
that
affects
his
right
to
vote.
unknown
speaker
how
about
employment?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
an
employer
is
having
the
hold
of
recruiting
him?
unknown
speaker
the
state
would
not
employ
him.
unknown
speaker
you
say
would
not
but
there
is
not
any
law
which
says
they
could
not
--
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
law
disqualifying
him
from
any
kind
of
position
or
employment
matter.
unknown
speaker
i
am
just
wondering
why
is
the
case
moot?
unknown
speaker
yes
but
he
served
his
time
and
the
i
think
that
sometimes
has
considerable
affect,
if
there
is
no
real
disability
to
travel
from
--
unknown
speaker
well,
then
what
would
you
suggest
then?
unknown
speaker
but
is
that
not
pretty
close
to
the
situation
you
have
here
justice
marshall's
hypothesis?
unknown
speaker
mr.
bailey,
may
i
ask,
this
practice
in
florida
--
what
you
have
it
is
the
same
conduct
right?
unknown
speaker
and,
that
this
petition
two,
the
identical
conduct
was
made
the
subject
of
two
different
counts.
unknown
speaker
is
that
a
practice,
that
you
follow
up
on
florida?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
i
asked
you,
what
happened
here
was
the
identical
conduct
was
made
the
subject
the
two
different
counts.
unknown
speaker
and
he
is
convicted
on
both.
unknown
speaker
different
elements?
unknown
speaker
why?
the
essential
element
i
gather
was
the
unlawful
purpose
element
of
this
statute
was
satisfied
by
the
attempt
to
break
in
the
box
car
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
you
relied
on.
unknown
speaker
and
without
that
would
you
convict
him,
without
that
proof
under
that
statute.
unknown
speaker
why?
so
let
us
say,
so
you
have
made
the
same
conduct,
the
identical
conduct
attempting
to
break
in
the
box
car.
the
subject
of
two,
prosecution
for
two
offenses.
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
did
not
have
the
proof
that
he
attempted
to
break
in
the
box
car,
could
never
have
convicted.
unknown
speaker
that
is
right,
well,
once
did
tape
attempting
to
break
in
to
the
box
car
and
you
made
it
the
subject
of
two
offenses.
you
gave
it
two
convictions
on
two
separate
things.
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
you
did,
i
am
talking
about
what
happened
in
this
case
if
i
understand
it
right.
unknown
speaker
i
asked
you
what
the
practice
was
in
florida,
is
that
what
you
do?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that
was
a
federal
question.
unknown
speaker
double
jeopardy.
unknown
speaker
the
time
of
federal
law.
unknown
speaker
of
florida
law.
unknown
speaker
now,
you
are
arguing
this
case,
that
is
not
the
argument
here
--.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bailey,
let
me
follow
through
on
justice
brennan's
question,
do
you
bring
the
two
charges
because
you
are
not
sure
how
far
your
evidence
will
take
you?
unknown
speaker
but
you
have
no
eye
witness
here
on
the
act
--
unknown
speaker
but
is
that
why
the
point
is
that
under
florida
law
he
was
found
guilty
of
two
separate
offenses
--
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
an
offense
that
a
lesser
included
offenses,
two
separate
offenses.
unknown
speaker
so
i
have
the
same
basic
transaction,
that
is
a
perfectly
rationale
and
a
legitimate
position
to
take
it
seems
to
me.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bailey,
i
may
ask
that
the
state
have
a
reason
not
to
urge
on
this
if
we
ought
not
reach
the
constitutional
question
here
as
to
a
concurrent
sentence?
unknown
speaker
the
concurrent
sentences.
unknown
speaker
when
he
served
one
--
unknown
speaker
these
are
being
decided
to
avoid
the
kind
of
this
offense?
unknown
speaker
well
apparently
if
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine
applies
here,
we
can
avoid
decision
of
the
constitutional
question.
it
would
be
rather
we
not
avoid
it
but
decide
it
even
if
you
could
have
urged
it.
unknown
speaker
you
did
not
say
that,
you
have
concurrent
sentences
here
do
you
not?
unknown
speaker
and
he
served
one
of
them.
unknown
speaker
served
both.
unknown
speaker
before,
even
on
the
count
one.
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
only
one
we
are
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
why
you
would
sure
or
not.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
whatever
disqualification
he
has
flow
from
count
two
and
nothing
more
from
count
one.
unknown
speaker
that
is
not
the
way
that
language
has
been
construed
by
the
only
court
that
has
construed
it,
as
we
are
told.
the
intermediate
appellate
court
of
hanks
against
states,
which
said
that
without
any
lawful
purpose
or
object
simply
meant
without
good
or
sufficient
reason
and
that
is
quite
different
from
saying
an
unlawful
purpose.
unknown
speaker
and
as
you
know,
we
have
to
take,
we
have
no
choice
but
to
take
the
construction
of
a
state
statute
given
to
it
by
the
state
courts
as
the
authoritative
construction.
unknown
speaker
well
that
is
what
the
statute
does
say
--
.
unknown
speaker
they
tell
us
that
is
what
the
statute
says
--.
unknown
speaker
no,
also
it
is
federal
criminal
law,
they
are
not
where
the
criminality
depends
upon
the
man's
purpose
when
he
travels
at
a
state.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
purpose
or
intent.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
state
has
the
constitutional
power
that
a
person
be
on
the
street
with
a
--
to
be
on
the
street
with
a
criminal
intent.
unknown
speaker
no,
even
though
you
--
he
has
not
committed
any
crime
yet
--
he
has
not
attempted
to
commit
any
crime
yet
--
unknown
speaker
but
he
intends
to,
do
you
think
that
is
enough.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that
but
what
about,
do
you
think
that
the
state
police
power
reaches
back
that
far
in
to
the
incubation
of
the
crime.
unknown
speaker
this
count
has
not
been
in
the
statute
anyway
--
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
the
only
example
statutes
(inaudible)
