in
this
case.

mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
this
case
is
here
on
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida
to
review
a
decision
upholding
the
constitutionality
of
a
wander
on
this
section
of
florida’s
vagrancy
statute
against
an
attack
made
and
considered
by
the
florida
supreme
court
and
rejected
that
violated
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
for
vagueness
and
over
breath.
in
this
particular
case
the
petitioners
were
charged
in
a
criminal
court
of
record
and
in
four
day
county
at
florida
by
an
information
filed
by
the
state
attorney
charging
the
defendants
and
tracking
the
exact
language
of
the
statute
856.02
which
is
before
this
court
to
review
charging
that
a
petitioners
were
“vagrants
by
wandering
and
strolling
around
from
place
to
place
without
any
lawful
purpose
or
objective.”
to
this
charge
the
petitioners
entered
a
plea
of
not
guilty
and
waived
trial
by
jury.
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
the
defense
counsel
made
an
oral
motion
to
dismiss
this
particular
charge
on
the
grounds
that
the
statute
was
void
for
vagueness
and
consequently
violated
due
process
clause
for
the
fourteenth
amendment.
that
motion
was
denied
and
the
trial
judge
made
a
specific
finding
of
the
statute
in
question
“crystal
clear.”
he
furthermore
entered
a
written
order
in
which
he
found
that
the
statute
was
“constitutional”
within
the
meaning
of
the
due
process
clause
of
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
state
constitution.
a
motion
for
new
trial
was
is
filed
in
this
case
attacking
the
statute
not
only
in
the
grounds
that
it
was
too
vague
but
also
on
the
ground
of
over
breath
and
that
motion
was
denied
and
again
the
trial
court
specifically
ruled
that
the
statute
was
constitutional
within
the
meaning
of
the
due
process
clause.
question
has
been
raised
as
to
whether
not
the
broadness
issue
was
properly
raised
in
the
florida
courts.
that
was
a
contended
on
the
motion
for
new
trial
and
specifically
rejected
by
the
trial
judge.
on
appeal,
the
supreme
court
of
florida
in
a
5:2
decision
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute
and
specifically
considered
and
rejected.
in
the
opinion,
the
petitioner's
dual
contentions,
the
dual
contentions
made
before
this
court
of
the
statute
was
“so
broad
and
vague
in
nature”
as
to
violate
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
court
has
granted
certiorari
on
the
question
phrased
in
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
namely
whether
the
wandering
section
of
the
statute
in
question
is
so
broad
and
vague
in
nature
as
to
violate
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
on
resolving
that
issue,
i
think
it
is
important
to
examine
first
the
exact
language
of
statute.
its
legislative
history
and
the
construction
given
to
it
by
the
florida
courts.
statutes
provides--.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
in
this
particular
case
your
honor
the
state
presented
one
witness
who
was
guard
employed
by
the
sea
coast
line
railroad
and
he
testified
that
he
was
patrolling
this
area
in
dade
county
about
7:30
to
8:00
at
night.
he
saw
a
car
--
he
was
in
the
car
and
he
saw
the
two
petitioners
along
with
the
third
party
walking
along
the
roadway
on
the
public
street.
he
passed
them
when
he
turned
around
of
the
corner,
he
saw
them
go
into
a
warehouse
area.
he
saw
them
go
behind
the
box
car
which
belong
to
the
sea
board
airline
railroad.
and
up
to
the
box
car
he
did
not
see
them
but
he
heard
some
noises
from
behind
the
box
car
and
he
saw
one
the
petitioners
smith
running
from
that
area,
he
went
over
and
placed
him
under
arrest
he
went
called
for
some
help
from
highly
a
police
department.
and
the
petitioners
were
then
placed
under
arrest.
the
petitioners
testified
in
this
case
that
they
were
never
in
the
railroad
yard.
the
warehouse
yard
rather.
that
they
never
attempted
to
break
in
any
railroad
car.
that
they
were
walking
along
the
street
and
they
were
going
to
see
a
friend.
those
are
the
proofs.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
i
think
they
have
a
legislate
certainly,
a
legislative
power
to
proscribe
trespassing
and
if
the
statute
in
question
was
a
trespass
statute
that
is
going
on
the
property
of
another
party,
a
railroad
company
without
permission
and
it
pretty
clearly
make
a
(inaudible).
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
not.
in
fact
there
was
—-
that
their
testimony
explicitly
was
they
were
on
the
public
street
at
all
times.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
well
i
am
really
lost
to
answer
that
your
honor
because
their
whole
contention
is
that
the
statute
lacks
an
ascertainable
standard
of
criminal
conduct.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
state's
theory?
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
the
state
did
not
really
offer
any
argument
in
the
lower
court.
the
defense
counsel
offered
an
argument
but
the
state
did
not.
on
resolving
the—
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
yes,
the
second
count
was—
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
the
first
count
was
the
vagrancy.
second
count
was
attempt
to
breaking
and
entering
a
railroad
car.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
that
is
correct.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
yes.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
there
is
no
question
but
the
evidence
was
sufficient
if
believed
by
the
trail
judge
was—
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
not
to
prove
an
unlawful
purpose
but
to
prove
attempt
to
break
in
a
railroad
car
which
is
separate—
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
well
it
is
a
separate
statute.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
yes.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
36
days
on
count
one
credit
for
time
serve.
the
second
count
was
six
months
on
the
county
jail
and
one
year
probation.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
that
is
correct.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
he
served
his
sentence
current.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
that
is
correct.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
no,
we
do
not
i
mean
that
was—if
they
were
convicted
under
a
valid
statute,
no
question
about
that
breaking
in
to
the
railroad.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
why
had
it—they
have
not
appealed
count
two
at
all
that
is
not
the
before
the
court.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
well,
you
honor
as
long
as
the
person
as
i
understand
law.
as
long
as
the
person
has
a
conviction
against
me
as
a
standing
to
object
to
it
and
there
is
a
conviction
in
this
case
against
to
the
defendant
for
vagrancy.
we
did
appeal
the
other
portion
to
the
district
court
of
appeal,
third
district
and
they
affirmed.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
no,
i
do
not
as
long
as
the
petitioner
has
a
conviction
against
him,
it
seems
to
me
we
have
standing
to
object
it.
the
statute
provides
person
wandering
or
strolling
around
from
place
to
place
without
any
lawful
purpose
or
object
shall
be
deemed
to
vagrants
and
punished
according
to
another
statute
which
provides
the
maximum
punishment
of
a
$200.00
fine
and
six
months
in
the
county
jail.
statute
itself,
of
course
condemns
20
other
varieties
of
vagrants
which
are
before
the
court
i
believe
in
a
comparable
case
of
the
jacksonville
ordinance
just
argued.
professor
arthur
sherry
of
the
university
of
california
law
school
in
a
survey
of
state
vagrancy
laws
has
referred
to
florida
act
as
“distinctly
elizabethan”
and
seems
to
have
been
selected
at
random
from
the
statute
of
elizabeth
that
was
inactive
in
1597
or
1598.
it
is
based
on
a
long
line
of
english
vagrancy
statutes
dating
back
to
the
fourteenth
century
which
constitute
some
of
the
most
oppressive
pieces
of
class
legislation
ever
enacted
by
the
english
parliament.
and
the
words
of
steven
and
in
history
of
the
criminal
law
of
england,
these
vagrancy
laws
constituted
the
criminal
aspect
of
the
poorer
laws.
the
purpose
of
which
was
to
confine
the
laboring
population
in
england
to
stated
places
and
fixed
places
of
the
board
where
they
required
to
work
at
fixed
wages.
furthermore
the
legislation
prohibited
wandering
around
in
england
and
it
was
exclusively
applied
of
course
against
the
laboring
classes
in
england.
now,
the
florida
courts
have
given
some
construction
to
the
statute
in
the
line
with
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
the
court
is
bound
by
state
court
in
construction
of
the
statute.
it
is
important
to
examine
several
cases.
leading
case
is
hanks
v.
state,
third
district
court
of
appeal
decision.
and
that
case,
the
third
district
court
interpreted
the
terms
persons
wandering
or
strolling
around
from
place
to
place
to
mean
by
any
mode
of
travel
whether
on
foot
or
in
a
vehicle.
in
that
particular
case,
the
petitioner
contended
that
he
was
not
in
violation
of
the
statute
because
he
was
arrested
in
a
stationary
automobile.
and
the
court
held
that
the
mode
of
travel
was
in
material
and
that
one
could
wander
and
stroll
even
in
a
stationary
automobile.
on
remand
in
johnson
versus
state
after
this
court
reversed
in
johnson
vs.
florida
the
supreme
court
of
florida
reluctantly
held
that
this
statute
had
no
application
to
a
person
sitting
on
a
bus
bench.
that
was
not
wandering
and
strolling.
and
finally
the
terms
without
any
lawful
purpose
or
object
has
been
construed
in
the
hanks
case
to
mean
“without
good
or
sufficient
reason.”
which
we
submit
is
even
vagrant
than
the
statute
itself
without
good
or
sufficient
reason.
and
finally,
the
supreme
court
of
florida
in
hedley
against
oakwood’s
has
held
that
the
statute
cannot
be
applied
against
any
person
unless
they
are
vagrants
of
their
own
volition
and
choice.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
yes.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
he
served
a
36
days
for
which
he
was
sentenced
in
this
case.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
that
is
right.
he
served
both.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
well,
he
has
a
conviction
on
his
record
there
will
be
some
certainly
employment
consequences
are
there,
the
consequences
not
in
terms
of
both
of
losing
the
right
to
vote
or
take
advantage.
in
the
court
below
the
supreme
court
of
florida
interpreted
the
statute
and
construed,
it
has
been
derived
from
“the
genera
of
vagrancy
laws”
which
have
longed
been
upheld
as
necessary
regulations
to
the
term
vagabondage
and
prevent
crimes.
and
the
imposition
upon
society
of
able
body
be
responsible
through
of
their
own
volition
become
burdens
upon
others
in
particularly
their
family
for
support.
and
we
submit
that
this
section
of
the
statute
as
construed
by
the
florida
courts
is
unconstitutional
on
its
base
in
violation
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
for
two
reasons.
first,
the
statute
is
so
vague
that
a
person
of
common
intelligence
cannot
know
what
it
is
forbidden
thereby
in
abiding
arbitrary
and
discriminatory
enforcement
of
the
statute
by
state
authorities
and
secondly
the
statute
is
so
broad
that
it
abridges
rights
protected
by
the
united
states
constitution
to
the
right
to
be
free
from
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures,
and
the
right
to
travel.
the
law
necessarily
enforces
--
pretty
clear,
it
has
been
stated
by
this
court
in
the
conley
case
that
the
terms
of
a
penal
statute
creating
a
new
offense
must
be
sufficiently
explicit
to
inform
those
who
are
subject
to
it.
what
conduct
on
their
part
will
render
them
liable
to
the
court's
penalties.
and
a
statute
which
either
forbids
or
requires
the
doing
of
an
act
in
terms
of
vague
that
men
of
common
intelligence
must
necessarily
guess
at
its
meaning
and
differ
as
to
its
application
violates
the
first
essential
of
due
process
of
law.
and
the
lanzetta
case,
this
court
held
that
a
vague
criminal
statute
was
void
on
space,
regardless
of
the
facts
of
the
case,
and
regardless
of
the
details
of
the
offense
charged.
now
the
supreme
court
in
this
particular
case
has
interpreted
this
statute
to
be
a
necessary
regulation
“to
prevent
crimes,
to
deter
vagabondage,
to
prevent
people
from
levying
off
other
people.”
now
this
construction
of
the
statute,
we
submit
is
a
frank
concession
that
the
law
does
not
even
purport
to
prohibit
specific
acts
of
criminal
conduct
but
instead
prohibits
a
vaguely
defined
way
of
life
which
is
thought
in
the
future
to
lead
the
crime.
but
it
is
clear
that
the
construction
of
the
statute
is
that
it
is
not
aimed
at
any
specific
acts
of
criminal
conduct.
and
district
justice
frankfurter
took
a
narrow
view
of
the
void
for
vagueness
doctrine
in
the
winters
case
pointed
this
out
precisely
when
he
said
that
these
vagrancy
statutes
are
on
the
class
by
themselves.
in
view
of
the
familiar
pieces
to
which
they
are
put
definiteness
is
designably
avoided
so
as
to
allow
the
net
to
be
casted
large
to
enable
men
to
be
caught
who
are
vaguely
undesirable
on
the
eyes
of
police
in
prosecution.
although
not
chargeable
with
any
particular
offense.
in
short,
these
vagrancy
statutes
and
laws
against
gangs
are
not
fenced
in
by
the
text
of
the
statute
or
by
the
subject
matters
so
as
to
give
notice
of
the
conduct
to
be
avoided.
and
that
is
exactly
how
the
florida
court
has
interpreted
the
statute.
namely
it
is
designed
to
prevent
crimes
and
not
to
act
on
any
specific
acts
of
criminal
conduct
and
the
attorney
general
with
commendable
candor
in
this
case
has
conceded,
that
this
statute
is
designed
to
prevent
crime
not
to
punish
crime
but
to
prevent
it
before
it
even
happens.
it
is
aimed
at
this
vaguely
defined
way
of
life.
vagabondage
and
wandering
around.
this
court
in
lanzetta
v.
new
jersey
considered
a
statute
which
is
rather
similar
to
this
case.
it
was
an
anti-gangster
statute,
the
purpose
of
the
statute
according
to
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
and
the
attorney
general
of
new
jersey
was
exactly
the
purpose
as
urged
here
in
the
statute.
namely
it
was
designed
to
prevent
crime
before
it
happened.
and
in
that
particular
case
there
was
a
new
jersey
statute
which
committed
a
crime
for
any
person
not
engaged
in
any
lawful
occupation
and
known
to
be
a
member
of
a
gang
consisting
of
two
or
more
persons.
and
this
court
held
that
the
term
gang
was
too
vague
to
withstand
any
type
of
constitutional
test.
now
we
contend
that
the
term
without
any
lawful
purpose
or
object
which
means
according
to
the
florida
court
“without
good
or
sufficient
reason
is
too
vague
to
withstand
constitutional
test.”
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
when
you
got
to
have
it.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
if
your
honor
please
he
certainly
had
noticed
that
this
activity
violated
the
burglary
statute.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
but
he
did
not
have
notice—
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
that
it
violated
a
vagrancy
statute.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
no.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
it
is
impossible
for
a
person
of
common
intelligence
to
know
what
this
means.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
no.
no,
i
mean
it
is
impossible
for
a
person
of
common
intelligence
to
--
no
of
course
that
type
of
activity
or
might
violate
another
statute.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
but
it
is
the
way
it
is
interpreted
by
the
florida
courts
is
without
good
and
sufficient
reason.
now,
i
submit
there
is
no
--
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
yes.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
attempting.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
your
honor
please,
my
our
position
is
that
the
statute
is
vague
on
its
face
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
get
in
to
the
facts
of
the
case
at
all.
if
the
statute
lacks
an
ascertainable
standard
in
criminal
conduct,
as
i
understand
the
law.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
it
is
not
necessary
to
even
consider
the
facts
of
the
case.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
well
it
is
our
position
that
there
is
no
conceivable
set
of
facts.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
that
this
statute
could
be
constitutionally
applied.
person
of
common
intelligence
in
not
placed
on
notices
to
what
a
good
or
sufficient
reason
for
wandering
and
strolling
might
be.
what
a
good
and
sufficient
reason
to
one
person
may
not
appear
so
to
another.
the
statute
for
instance
gives
no
notices
to
whether
or
anyone
for
wandering
and
strolling.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
well
your
honor
that
is
--
we
submit
is
simply
too
vague.
to
let
a
person
know
exactly
what
he
is
not
supposed
to
do.
now
there
is
no
question
that
your
honor
is
alluding
to
the
fact
that
this
man
was
violating
a
specific
statute
in
a
florida
books
which
was
attempted
burglary
statute
which
i
think
illustrates,
the
really
non
essentialness
of
this
type
of
legislation.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
that
is
correct.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
well,
perhaps
i
am
misreading
some
of
the
cases
in
this
area
but
as
i
understand
the
law
it
is
if
the
statute
lacks
an
ascertainable
standard
of
criminal
conduct,
that
is
if
we
look
at
this
statute
on
its
face
and
we
saw
no
real
ascertainable
standard
criminal
conduct.
then
statute
is
unconstitutional,
regardless
of
what
the
facts
of
case
maybe.
in
other
words,
the
facts
of
the
case
do
not
save
the
statute.
the
statute
gives
no
notice
for
instance
as
to
whether
or
not
aim
was
wandering
or
strolling
around
from
place
to
place.
it
was
about
good
and
sufficient
reason.
if
so,
i
suppose
most
of
florida’s
tourists
and
retirees
who
come
to
florida
who
wander
around
out
of
aimlessly
in
the
resort
areas
and
on
the
beaches
of
our
state
and
shopping
areas
would
arguably
would
be
in
violation
of
the
statutes.
a
person
of
common
intelligence
is
also
not
placed
on
notice
as
to
whether
not
he
is
to
give
a
good
or
sufficient
reason
for
his
wandering
and
strolling
when
stopped
by
an
inquiring
police
officer,
or
whether
his
silence
on
the
subject
would
automatically
mean
he
did
not
have
a
good
and
sufficient
reason
for
wandering
and
strolling.
also
the
statute
gives
no
notice
as
to
whether
or
not
the
inquiring
police
officer
must
be
satisfied
that
the
reason
given
by
the
person
was
good
and
sufficient
reason
for
wandering
and
strolling.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
your
honor
i
think
there
is
a
difference
between
suspicious
conduct
and
a
violation
of
statute,
there
is
no
question
that
if
a
police
officer
saw
a
man
at
3
o'
clock
in
the
morning,
wandering
around
the
place
in
a
dark
area.
that
he
would
be
on
inquiry
to
investigate
that
thing
but
i
submit
as
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out
in
his
concurring
opinion
before
that
the
government
has
no
constitutional
authority
to
make
that
suspicious
circumstance
a
criminal
offense.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
in
terry
v.
ohio,
i
think
it
is
pretty
clear,
it
is
fairly
clear
as
to
what
his
constitutional
authority
is,
if
he
has
any
facts
to
which
he
can
point
to,
which
are
really
less
than
probable
cause,
that
the
man
is
armed
and
dangerous
and
a
threat
either
him
or
people
in
the
vicinity
he
may
conduct
a
carefully
limited
search
in
all
his
clothing
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
has
any
weapons.
certainly,
there
is
no
constitutional
prohibition
against
any
police
officer
asking
somebody
what
he
is
doing
in
the
area.
without
getting
in
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not,
a
person
has
to
answer
the
question.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
no.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
because
i
think
that
may
stop
any
potential
criminal
conduct
if
the
officer
--
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
no,
not
at
all.
but
i
do
think
that
--
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
well
without
reaching
that
question,
i
do
not
know
whether
this
court
has
ever
really
resolved
that
issue.
whether
or
not
it
is
possible
for
a
person
to
be
detained
and
requires
some
answers
but
i
am
saying.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
yes,
i
think
they
do.
certainly
and
i
think
the
terry
case,
just
in
a
concurring
opinion
by
mr.
justice
white,
a
suggestion
was
made
that
they
should
have
a
power
of
police
in
addition
to
stopping
and
frisking
and
also
inquire.
now,
the
vague
and
--
yes
sir.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
i
believe
so
but
–
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
i
have
a
weaker
argument,
i
think
yes.
there
is
some
caselaw
interpreting
mens
rea,
and
what
mens
rea
means
criminal
intent,
but
even
that
body
of
law
refers
to
intent
to
do
something,
was
a
concept
of
criminal
act
as
i
understand
that
it
is
a
combination
of
intent
of
an
act.
the
wandering
is
certainly
not
to
and
if
a
social
—
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
criminal
and
i
deny
that
the
government
has
a
constitutional
authority
to
punish
him.
and
to
walk
around
thinking
that
you
are
going
to
commit
a
crime
in
one
thing
but
doing
in
to
something
else.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
that
is
correct
but
the
attempt
law
as
i
understand
it
is
that
mere
preparation
to
commit
an
offense
is
not
an
attempt.
there
must
be
an
over
it
act,
toward
commission
of
that
offense.
in
other
words
to
think
about
committing
the
offense
yourself.
i
mean
not
in
conspiracy
with
anyone
else
but
to
think
about
it
and
even
make
some
arrangements
to
commit
it,
is
not
an
attempt
to
commit
it.
there
must
be
an
over
it
act
toward
designed
to
accomplish
that
so
i
would
deny
that
this
government
has
the
constitutional
authority
to
punish
somebody
for
thinking
about
committing
a
crime.
well—
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
there
is
no
question
that
is
a
suspicious
circumstance
which
a
police
officer
may
want
to
inquire
about
but
i
do
not
think
if
that
is
suspicion
on
itself
to
punish
him
for
committing
a
crime.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
that
is
correct.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
that
is
good.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
and
the
construction
is
well,
good
or
sufficient
reason.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
i
do
not
think,
that
government
has
a
constitutional
authority
to
prohibit
that.
he
is
in
the
process
of
doing
it
or
commits
an
act
towards
accomplishing
that.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
well
i
would
say
a
due
process
clause
and
i
do
not
know
if
that
answers
you
honors
question
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
submit
limits
to
power
of
the
state
to
punish
certain
types
of
acts
of
crimes.
i
supposed
this
goes
to--
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
but
the
unlawful
purpose
means
without
good
and
sufficient
reason.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
that
is
a
same
thing.
well
not
really
the
same
thing
is
not
really
--
it
is
vagrants.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
that
is
right,
that
is
my
position.
that
is
a
violation
of
a
due
process.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
yes
i
guess,
if
does
he
seem
to
substantive
argument.
yes,
that
is
correct
i
think
i
could
we
arguing
into
a
substitute
argument.
the
vagueness
point
however
is
still
valid,
seems
to
me.
if
it
does
not
apprise
a
person,
as
to
what
an
unlawful
purpose
is?
i
mean
is
one
thing
to
--
as
the
respondent
argues
that
a
person
should
know
in
heart
of
hearts,
what
is
unlawful.
it
seems
to
me
that
is
function
of
the
criminal
statute
to
say
exactly
what
is
unlawful.
and
it
does
not,
it
simply
does
not.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
as
a
matter
of
fact
your
honor,
if
there
was
a
statute
saying,
you
shall
not
commit
an
unlawful
act
and
the
evidence
was
that
this
man
had
broken
and
entered
a
railroad
car,
i
do
not
think
that
there
would
be
any
question
statute
be
struck
down
on
the
board
for
vagrancy.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
well
i
do
not
agree
because—
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
pardon
me.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
six
months.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
no
i
do
not
believe
so.
there
are
set
of
a
statute
on
felonies.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
yes
sir.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
let
me
answer
this
way.
violation
of
a
state
statute
whether
be
felony
or
misdemeanor
maybe
used
to
impeach
the
man
if
the
defendant
takes
to
stand
as
a
witness
he
is
violate—
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
that
is
correct.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
now
if
he
violates
a
municipal
ordinance,
he
cannot
be
impeached
for
that.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
legal
disability?
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
no
it
does
not
affect
the
right
to
vote.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
well,
the
employment
certainly
--
it
would
prohibit
him
--
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
a
state
employer,
yes.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
that
is
right.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
i
really
do
not
know
your
know
i
mean
i
am
trying
to
think
there
are.
but
i
could
not,
i
really
cannot
search
any
statutes
on
that.
i
am
trying
to
think
they
are.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
well
i
do
not
think
the
case
is
moot
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
he
has
a
conviction
on
his
record
and
this
is
going
to
affect
him.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
i
think
your
honor
is
already
mentioned
one,
legal
impeachment
--
.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
well,
i
am
also
suggesting
a
social
disability
as
well,
i
mean,
it
is
difficult
certainly
and
i
think
the
stigma
which
comes
from
conviction
of
any
crime
is
a
very
heavy
one
in
this
society.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
that
is
correct,
he
had
two
convictions.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
i
think
they
certainly
do,
the
longer
the
record
the
worst
it
becomes.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
i
do
not
think
i
am
speculating
at
all
from
what
i
have
seen
trial
judges
do,
the
longer
the
record
the
bigger
the
sentence.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
no,
no
the
way
you
phrase
is
no
there
is
no
question
at
it.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
i
do
not
think
so
because
i
think
some
employers
might
want
to
take
chance
with
somebody
which
is
one
conviction
second
one
is
the
vagrant
then
may
consider
him
to
be
an
irresponsible
type
of
person,
just
not
going
to
be
able
to
(inaudible)
it.
i
do
not
know
i
guess,
we
are
speculating
really
in
one
of
this
area
but
it
seems
to
me
as
almost
given
that
any
conviction
of
any
crime
of
whatever
who
variety
it
is,
is
bound
to
hurt
a
person
living
in
this
country.
it
certainly
cannot
help
him,
especially.
thank
you.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i
move
that
nelson
bailey
be
permitted
to
argue
pro
hac
vice
on
behalf
of
the
respondent
in
this
case.
he
is
a
member
in
good
standing
of
the
bar
of
the
of
state
of
florida
but
he
has
been
a
member
for
less
than
three
years.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
this
case
is
here
on
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida
to
review
a
decision
upholding
the
constitutionality
of
a
wander
on
this
section
of
florida’s
vagrancy
statute
against
an
attack
made
and
considered
by
the
florida
supreme
court
and
rejected
that
violated
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
for
vagueness
and
over
breath.
in
this
particular
case
the
petitioners
were
charged
in
a
criminal
court
of
record
and
in
four
day
county
at
florida
by
an
information
filed
by
the
state
attorney
charging
the
defendants
and
tracking
the
exact
language
of
the
statute
856.02
which
is
before
this
court
to
review
charging
that
a
petitioners
were
“vagrants
by
wandering
and
strolling
around
from
place
to
place
without
any
lawful
purpose
or
objective.”
to
this
charge
the
petitioners
entered
a
plea
of
not
guilty
and
waived
trial
by
jury.
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
the
defense
counsel
made
an
oral
motion
to
dismiss
this
particular
charge
on
the
grounds
that
the
statute
was
void
for
vagueness
and
consequently
violated
due
process
clause
for
the
fourteenth
amendment.
that
motion
was
denied
and
the
trial
judge
made
a
specific
finding
of
the
statute
in
question
“crystal
clear.”
he
furthermore
entered
a
written
order
in
which
he
found
that
the
statute
was
“constitutional”
within
the
meaning
of
the
due
process
clause
of
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
state
constitution.
a
motion
for
new
trial
was
is
filed
in
this
case
attacking
the
statute
not
only
in
the
grounds
that
it
was
too
vague
but
also
on
the
ground
of
over
breath
and
that
motion
was
denied
and
again
the
trial
court
specifically
ruled
that
the
statute
was
constitutional
within
the
meaning
of
the
due
process
clause.
question
has
been
raised
as
to
whether
not
the
broadness
issue
was
properly
raised
in
the
florida
courts.
that
was
a
contended
on
the
motion
for
new
trial
and
specifically
rejected
by
the
trial
judge.
on
appeal,
the
supreme
court
of
florida
in
a
5:2
decision
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute
and
specifically
considered
and
rejected.
in
the
opinion,
the
petitioner's
dual
contentions,
the
dual
contentions
made
before
this
court
of
the
statute
was
“so
broad
and
vague
in
nature”
as
to
violate
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
court
has
granted
certiorari
on
the
question
phrased
in
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
namely
whether
the
wandering
section
of
the
statute
in
question
is
so
broad
and
vague
in
nature
as
to
violate
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
on
resolving
that
issue,
i
think
it
is
important
to
examine
first
the
exact
language
of
statute.
its
legislative
history
and
the
construction
given
to
it
by
the
florida
courts.
statutes
provides--.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
in
this
particular
case
your
honor
the
state
presented
one
witness
who
was
guard
employed
by
the
sea
coast
line
railroad
and
he
testified
that
he
was
patrolling
this
area
in
dade
county
about
7:30
to
8:00
at
night.
he
saw
a
car
--
he
was
in
the
car
and
he
saw
the
two
petitioners
along
with
the
third
party
walking
along
the
roadway
on
the
public
street.
he
passed
them
when
he
turned
around
of
the
corner,
he
saw
them
go
into
a
warehouse
area.
he
saw
them
go
behind
the
box
car
which
belong
to
the
sea
board
airline
railroad.
and
up
to
the
box
car
he
did
not
see
them
but
he
heard
some
noises
from
behind
the
box
car
and
he
saw
one
the
petitioners
smith
running
from
that
area,
he
went
over
and
placed
him
under
arrest
he
went
called
for
some
help
from
highly
a
police
department.
and
the
petitioners
were
then
placed
under
arrest.
the
petitioners
testified
in
this
case
that
they
were
never
in
the
railroad
yard.
the
warehouse
yard
rather.
that
they
never
attempted
to
break
in
any
railroad
car.
that
they
were
walking
along
the
street
and
they
were
going
to
see
a
friend.
those
are
the
proofs.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
i
think
they
have
a
legislate
certainly,
a
legislative
power
to
proscribe
trespassing
and
if
the
statute
in
question
was
a
trespass
statute
that
is
going
on
the
property
of
another
party,
a
railroad
company
without
permission
and
it
pretty
clearly
make
a
(inaudible).
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
not.
in
fact
there
was
—-
that
their
testimony
explicitly
was
they
were
on
the
public
street
at
all
times.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
well
i
am
really
lost
to
answer
that
your
honor
because
their
whole
contention
is
that
the
statute
lacks
an
ascertainable
standard
of
criminal
conduct.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
state's
theory?
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
the
state
did
not
really
offer
any
argument
in
the
lower
court.
the
defense
counsel
offered
an
argument
but
the
state
did
not.
on
resolving
the—
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
yes,
the
second
count
was—
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
the
first
count
was
the
vagrancy.
second
count
was
attempt
to
breaking
and
entering
a
railroad
car.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
that
is
correct.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
yes.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
there
is
no
question
but
the
evidence
was
sufficient
if
believed
by
the
trail
judge
was—
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
not
to
prove
an
unlawful
purpose
but
to
prove
attempt
to
break
in
a
railroad
car
which
is
separate—
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
well
it
is
a
separate
statute.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
yes.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
36
days
on
count
one
credit
for
time
serve.
the
second
count
was
six
months
on
the
county
jail
and
one
year
probation.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
that
is
correct.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
he
served
his
sentence
current.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
that
is
correct.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
no,
we
do
not
i
mean
that
was—if
they
were
convicted
under
a
valid
statute,
no
question
about
that
breaking
in
to
the
railroad.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
why
had
it—they
have
not
appealed
count
two
at
all
that
is
not
the
before
the
court.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
well,
you
honor
as
long
as
the
person
as
i
understand
law.
as
long
as
the
person
has
a
conviction
against
me
as
a
standing
to
object
to
it
and
there
is
a
conviction
in
this
case
against
to
the
defendant
for
vagrancy.
we
did
appeal
the
other
portion
to
the
district
court
of
appeal,
third
district
and
they
affirmed.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
no,
i
do
not
as
long
as
the
petitioner
has
a
conviction
against
him,
it
seems
to
me
we
have
standing
to
object
it.
the
statute
provides
person
wandering
or
strolling
around
from
place
to
place
without
any
lawful
purpose
or
object
shall
be
deemed
to
vagrants
and
punished
according
to
another
statute
which
provides
the
maximum
punishment
of
a
$200.00
fine
and
six
months
in
the
county
jail.
statute
itself,
of
course
condemns
20
other
varieties
of
vagrants
which
are
before
the
court
i
believe
in
a
comparable
case
of
the
jacksonville
ordinance
just
argued.
professor
arthur
sherry
of
the
university
of
california
law
school
in
a
survey
of
state
vagrancy
laws
has
referred
to
florida
act
as
“distinctly
elizabethan”
and
seems
to
have
been
selected
at
random
from
the
statute
of
elizabeth
that
was
inactive
in
1597
or
1598.
it
is
based
on
a
long
line
of
english
vagrancy
statutes
dating
back
to
the
fourteenth
century
which
constitute
some
of
the
most
oppressive
pieces
of
class
legislation
ever
enacted
by
the
english
parliament.
and
the
words
of
steven
and
in
history
of
the
criminal
law
of
england,
these
vagrancy
laws
constituted
the
criminal
aspect
of
the
poorer
laws.
the
purpose
of
which
was
to
confine
the
laboring
population
in
england
to
stated
places
and
fixed
places
of
the
board
where
they
required
to
work
at
fixed
wages.
furthermore
the
legislation
prohibited
wandering
around
in
england
and
it
was
exclusively
applied
of
course
against
the
laboring
classes
in
england.
now,
the
florida
courts
have
given
some
construction
to
the
statute
in
the
line
with
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
the
court
is
bound
by
state
court
in
construction
of
the
statute.
it
is
important
to
examine
several
cases.
leading
case
is
hanks
v.
state,
third
district
court
of
appeal
decision.
and
that
case,
the
third
district
court
interpreted
the
terms
persons
wandering
or
strolling
around
from
place
to
place
to
mean
by
any
mode
of
travel
whether
on
foot
or
in
a
vehicle.
in
that
particular
case,
the
petitioner
contended
that
he
was
not
in
violation
of
the
statute
because
he
was
arrested
in
a
stationary
automobile.
and
the
court
held
that
the
mode
of
travel
was
in
material
and
that
one
could
wander
and
stroll
even
in
a
stationary
automobile.
on
remand
in
johnson
versus
state
after
this
court
reversed
in
johnson
vs.
florida
the
supreme
court
of
florida
reluctantly
held
that
this
statute
had
no
application
to
a
person
sitting
on
a
bus
bench.
that
was
not
wandering
and
strolling.
and
finally
the
terms
without
any
lawful
purpose
or
object
has
been
construed
in
the
hanks
case
to
mean
“without
good
or
sufficient
reason.”
which
we
submit
is
even
vagrant
than
the
statute
itself
without
good
or
sufficient
reason.
and
finally,
the
supreme
court
of
florida
in
hedley
against
oakwood’s
has
held
that
the
statute
cannot
be
applied
against
any
person
unless
they
are
vagrants
of
their
own
volition
and
choice.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
yes.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
he
served
a
36
days
for
which
he
was
sentenced
in
this
case.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
that
is
right.
he
served
both.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
well,
he
has
a
conviction
on
his
record
there
will
be
some
certainly
employment
consequences
are
there,
the
consequences
not
in
terms
of
both
of
losing
the
right
to
vote
or
take
advantage.
in
the
court
below
the
supreme
court
of
florida
interpreted
the
statute
and
construed,
it
has
been
derived
from
“the
genera
of
vagrancy
laws”
which
have
longed
been
upheld
as
necessary
regulations
to
the
term
vagabondage
and
prevent
crimes.
and
the
imposition
upon
society
of
able
body
be
responsible
through
of
their
own
volition
become
burdens
upon
others
in
particularly
their
family
for
support.
and
we
submit
that
this
section
of
the
statute
as
construed
by
the
florida
courts
is
unconstitutional
on
its
base
in
violation
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
for
two
reasons.
first,
the
statute
is
so
vague
that
a
person
of
common
intelligence
cannot
know
what
it
is
forbidden
thereby
in
abiding
arbitrary
and
discriminatory
enforcement
of
the
statute
by
state
authorities
and
secondly
the
statute
is
so
broad
that
it
abridges
rights
protected
by
the
united
states
constitution
to
the
right
to
be
free
from
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures,
and
the
right
to
travel.
the
law
necessarily
enforces
--
pretty
clear,
it
has
been
stated
by
this
court
in
the
conley
case
that
the
terms
of
a
penal
statute
creating
a
new
offense
must
be
sufficiently
explicit
to
inform
those
who
are
subject
to
it.
what
conduct
on
their
part
will
render
them
liable
to
the
court's
penalties.
and
a
statute
which
either
forbids
or
requires
the
doing
of
an
act
in
terms
of
vague
that
men
of
common
intelligence
must
necessarily
guess
at
its
meaning
and
differ
as
to
its
application
violates
the
first
essential
of
due
process
of
law.
and
the
lanzetta
case,
this
court
held
that
a
vague
criminal
statute
was
void
on
space,
regardless
of
the
facts
of
the
case,
and
regardless
of
the
details
of
the
offense
charged.
now
the
supreme
court
in
this
particular
case
has
interpreted
this
statute
to
be
a
necessary
regulation
“to
prevent
crimes,
to
deter
vagabondage,
to
prevent
people
from
levying
off
other
people.”
now
this
construction
of
the
statute,
we
submit
is
a
frank
concession
that
the
law
does
not
even
purport
to
prohibit
specific
acts
of
criminal
conduct
but
instead
prohibits
a
vaguely
defined
way
of
life
which
is
thought
in
the
future
to
lead
the
crime.
but
it
is
clear
that
the
construction
of
the
statute
is
that
it
is
not
aimed
at
any
specific
acts
of
criminal
conduct.
and
district
justice
frankfurter
took
a
narrow
view
of
the
void
for
vagueness
doctrine
in
the
winters
case
pointed
this
out
precisely
when
he
said
that
these
vagrancy
statutes
are
on
the
class
by
themselves.
in
view
of
the
familiar
pieces
to
which
they
are
put
definiteness
is
designably
avoided
so
as
to
allow
the
net
to
be
casted
large
to
enable
men
to
be
caught
who
are
vaguely
undesirable
on
the
eyes
of
police
in
prosecution.
although
not
chargeable
with
any
particular
offense.
in
short,
these
vagrancy
statutes
and
laws
against
gangs
are
not
fenced
in
by
the
text
of
the
statute
or
by
the
subject
matters
so
as
to
give
notice
of
the
conduct
to
be
avoided.
and
that
is
exactly
how
the
florida
court
has
interpreted
the
statute.
namely
it
is
designed
to
prevent
crimes
and
not
to
act
on
any
specific
acts
of
criminal
conduct
and
the
attorney
general
with
commendable
candor
in
this
case
has
conceded,
that
this
statute
is
designed
to
prevent
crime
not
to
punish
crime
but
to
prevent
it
before
it
even
happens.
it
is
aimed
at
this
vaguely
defined
way
of
life.
vagabondage
and
wandering
around.
this
court
in
lanzetta
v.
new
jersey
considered
a
statute
which
is
rather
similar
to
this
case.
it
was
an
anti-gangster
statute,
the
purpose
of
the
statute
according
to
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
and
the
attorney
general
of
new
jersey
was
exactly
the
purpose
as
urged
here
in
the
statute.
namely
it
was
designed
to
prevent
crime
before
it
happened.
and
in
that
particular
case
there
was
a
new
jersey
statute
which
committed
a
crime
for
any
person
not
engaged
in
any
lawful
occupation
and
known
to
be
a
member
of
a
gang
consisting
of
two
or
more
persons.
and
this
court
held
that
the
term
gang
was
too
vague
to
withstand
any
type
of
constitutional
test.
now
we
contend
that
the
term
without
any
lawful
purpose
or
object
which
means
according
to
the
florida
court
“without
good
or
sufficient
reason
is
too
vague
to
withstand
constitutional
test.”
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
when
you
got
to
have
it.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
if
your
honor
please
he
certainly
had
noticed
that
this
activity
violated
the
burglary
statute.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
but
he
did
not
have
notice—
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
that
it
violated
a
vagrancy
statute.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
no.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
it
is
impossible
for
a
person
of
common
intelligence
to
know
what
this
means.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
no.
no,
i
mean
it
is
impossible
for
a
person
of
common
intelligence
to
--
no
of
course
that
type
of
activity
or
might
violate
another
statute.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
but
it
is
the
way
it
is
interpreted
by
the
florida
courts
is
without
good
and
sufficient
reason.
now,
i
submit
there
is
no
--
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
yes.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
attempting.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
your
honor
please,
my
our
position
is
that
the
statute
is
vague
on
its
face
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
get
in
to
the
facts
of
the
case
at
all.
if
the
statute
lacks
an
ascertainable
standard
in
criminal
conduct,
as
i
understand
the
law.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
it
is
not
necessary
to
even
consider
the
facts
of
the
case.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
well
it
is
our
position
that
there
is
no
conceivable
set
of
facts.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
that
this
statute
could
be
constitutionally
applied.
person
of
common
intelligence
in
not
placed
on
notices
to
what
a
good
or
sufficient
reason
for
wandering
and
strolling
might
be.
what
a
good
and
sufficient
reason
to
one
person
may
not
appear
so
to
another.
the
statute
for
instance
gives
no
notices
to
whether
or
anyone
for
wandering
and
strolling.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
well
your
honor
that
is
--
we
submit
is
simply
too
vague.
to
let
a
person
know
exactly
what
he
is
not
supposed
to
do.
now
there
is
no
question
that
your
honor
is
alluding
to
the
fact
that
this
man
was
violating
a
specific
statute
in
a
florida
books
which
was
attempted
burglary
statute
which
i
think
illustrates,
the
really
non
essentialness
of
this
type
of
legislation.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
that
is
correct.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
well,
perhaps
i
am
misreading
some
of
the
cases
in
this
area
but
as
i
understand
the
law
it
is
if
the
statute
lacks
an
ascertainable
standard
of
criminal
conduct,
that
is
if
we
look
at
this
statute
on
its
face
and
we
saw
no
real
ascertainable
standard
criminal
conduct.
then
statute
is
unconstitutional,
regardless
of
what
the
facts
of
case
maybe.
in
other
words,
the
facts
of
the
case
do
not
save
the
statute.
the
statute
gives
no
notice
for
instance
as
to
whether
or
not
aim
was
wandering
or
strolling
around
from
place
to
place.
it
was
about
good
and
sufficient
reason.
if
so,
i
suppose
most
of
florida’s
tourists
and
retirees
who
come
to
florida
who
wander
around
out
of
aimlessly
in
the
resort
areas
and
on
the
beaches
of
our
state
and
shopping
areas
would
arguably
would
be
in
violation
of
the
statutes.
a
person
of
common
intelligence
is
also
not
placed
on
notice
as
to
whether
not
he
is
to
give
a
good
or
sufficient
reason
for
his
wandering
and
strolling
when
stopped
by
an
inquiring
police
officer,
or
whether
his
silence
on
the
subject
would
automatically
mean
he
did
not
have
a
good
and
sufficient
reason
for
wandering
and
strolling.
also
the
statute
gives
no
notice
as
to
whether
or
not
the
inquiring
police
officer
must
be
satisfied
that
the
reason
given
by
the
person
was
good
and
sufficient
reason
for
wandering
and
strolling.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
your
honor
i
think
there
is
a
difference
between
suspicious
conduct
and
a
violation
of
statute,
there
is
no
question
that
if
a
police
officer
saw
a
man
at
3
o'
clock
in
the
morning,
wandering
around
the
place
in
a
dark
area.
that
he
would
be
on
inquiry
to
investigate
that
thing
but
i
submit
as
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out
in
his
concurring
opinion
before
that
the
government
has
no
constitutional
authority
to
make
that
suspicious
circumstance
a
criminal
offense.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
in
terry
v.
ohio,
i
think
it
is
pretty
clear,
it
is
fairly
clear
as
to
what
his
constitutional
authority
is,
if
he
has
any
facts
to
which
he
can
point
to,
which
are
really
less
than
probable
cause,
that
the
man
is
armed
and
dangerous
and
a
threat
either
him
or
people
in
the
vicinity
he
may
conduct
a
carefully
limited
search
in
all
his
clothing
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
has
any
weapons.
certainly,
there
is
no
constitutional
prohibition
against
any
police
officer
asking
somebody
what
he
is
doing
in
the
area.
without
getting
in
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not,
a
person
has
to
answer
the
question.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
no.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
because
i
think
that
may
stop
any
potential
criminal
conduct
if
the
officer
--
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
no,
not
at
all.
but
i
do
think
that
--
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
well
without
reaching
that
question,
i
do
not
know
whether
this
court
has
ever
really
resolved
that
issue.
whether
or
not
it
is
possible
for
a
person
to
be
detained
and
requires
some
answers
but
i
am
saying.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
yes,
i
think
they
do.
certainly
and
i
think
the
terry
case,
just
in
a
concurring
opinion
by
mr.
justice
white,
a
suggestion
was
made
that
they
should
have
a
power
of
police
in
addition
to
stopping
and
frisking
and
also
inquire.
now,
the
vague
and
--
yes
sir.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
i
believe
so
but
–
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
i
have
a
weaker
argument,
i
think
yes.
there
is
some
caselaw
interpreting
mens
rea,
and
what
mens
rea
means
criminal
intent,
but
even
that
body
of
law
refers
to
intent
to
do
something,
was
a
concept
of
criminal
act
as
i
understand
that
it
is
a
combination
of
intent
of
an
act.
the
wandering
is
certainly
not
to
and
if
a
social
—
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
criminal
and
i
deny
that
the
government
has
a
constitutional
authority
to
punish
him.
and
to
walk
around
thinking
that
you
are
going
to
commit
a
crime
in
one
thing
but
doing
in
to
something
else.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
that
is
correct
but
the
attempt
law
as
i
understand
it
is
that
mere
preparation
to
commit
an
offense
is
not
an
attempt.
there
must
be
an
over
it
act,
toward
commission
of
that
offense.
in
other
words
to
think
about
committing
the
offense
yourself.
i
mean
not
in
conspiracy
with
anyone
else
but
to
think
about
it
and
even
make
some
arrangements
to
commit
it,
is
not
an
attempt
to
commit
it.
there
must
be
an
over
it
act
toward
designed
to
accomplish
that
so
i
would
deny
that
this
government
has
the
constitutional
authority
to
punish
somebody
for
thinking
about
committing
a
crime.
well—
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
there
is
no
question
that
is
a
suspicious
circumstance
which
a
police
officer
may
want
to
inquire
about
but
i
do
not
think
if
that
is
suspicion
on
itself
to
punish
him
for
committing
a
crime.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
that
is
correct.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
that
is
good.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
and
the
construction
is
well,
good
or
sufficient
reason.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
i
do
not
think,
that
government
has
a
constitutional
authority
to
prohibit
that.
he
is
in
the
process
of
doing
it
or
commits
an
act
towards
accomplishing
that.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
well
i
would
say
a
due
process
clause
and
i
do
not
know
if
that
answers
you
honors
question
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
submit
limits
to
power
of
the
state
to
punish
certain
types
of
acts
of
crimes.
i
supposed
this
goes
to--
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
but
the
unlawful
purpose
means
without
good
and
sufficient
reason.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
that
is
a
same
thing.
well
not
really
the
same
thing
is
not
really
--
it
is
vagrants.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
that
is
right,
that
is
my
position.
that
is
a
violation
of
a
due
process.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
yes
i
guess,
if
does
he
seem
to
substantive
argument.
yes,
that
is
correct
i
think
i
could
we
arguing
into
a
substitute
argument.
the
vagueness
point
however
is
still
valid,
seems
to
me.
if
it
does
not
apprise
a
person,
as
to
what
an
unlawful
purpose
is?
i
mean
is
one
thing
to
--
as
the
respondent
argues
that
a
person
should
know
in
heart
of
hearts,
what
is
unlawful.
it
seems
to
me
that
is
function
of
the
criminal
statute
to
say
exactly
what
is
unlawful.
and
it
does
not,
it
simply
does
not.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
as
a
matter
of
fact
your
honor,
if
there
was
a
statute
saying,
you
shall
not
commit
an
unlawful
act
and
the
evidence
was
that
this
man
had
broken
and
entered
a
railroad
car,
i
do
not
think
that
there
would
be
any
question
statute
be
struck
down
on
the
board
for
vagrancy.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
well
i
do
not
agree
because—
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
pardon
me.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
six
months.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
no
i
do
not
believe
so.
there
are
set
of
a
statute
on
felonies.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
yes
sir.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
let
me
answer
this
way.
violation
of
a
state
statute
whether
be
felony
or
misdemeanor
maybe
used
to
impeach
the
man
if
the
defendant
takes
to
stand
as
a
witness
he
is
violate—
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
that
is
correct.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
now
if
he
violates
a
municipal
ordinance,
he
cannot
be
impeached
for
that.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
legal
disability?
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
no
it
does
not
affect
the
right
to
vote.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
well,
the
employment
certainly
--
it
would
prohibit
him
--
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
a
state
employer,
yes.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
that
is
right.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
i
really
do
not
know
your
know
i
mean
i
am
trying
to
think
there
are.
but
i
could
not,
i
really
cannot
search
any
statutes
on
that.
i
am
trying
to
think
they
are.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
well
i
do
not
think
the
case
is
moot
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
he
has
a
conviction
on
his
record
and
this
is
going
to
affect
him.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
i
think
your
honor
is
already
mentioned
one,
legal
impeachment
--
.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
well,
i
am
also
suggesting
a
social
disability
as
well,
i
mean,
it
is
difficult
certainly
and
i
think
the
stigma
which
comes
from
conviction
of
any
crime
is
a
very
heavy
one
in
this
society.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
that
is
correct,
he
had
two
convictions.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
i
think
they
certainly
do,
the
longer
the
record
the
worst
it
becomes.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
i
do
not
think
i
am
speculating
at
all
from
what
i
have
seen
trial
judges
do,
the
longer
the
record
the
bigger
the
sentence.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
no,
no
the
way
you
phrase
is
no
there
is
no
question
at
it.
mr.
phillip
a.
hubbart
i
do
not
think
so
because
i
think
some
employers
might
want
to
take
chance
with
somebody
which
is
one
conviction
second
one
is
the
vagrant
then
may
consider
him
to
be
an
irresponsible
type
of
person,
just
not
going
to
be
able
to
(inaudible)
it.
i
do
not
know
i
guess,
we
are
speculating
really
in
one
of
this
area
but
it
seems
to
me
as
almost
given
that
any
conviction
of
any
crime
of
whatever
who
variety
it
is,
is
bound
to
hurt
a
person
living
in
this
country.
it
certainly
cannot
help
him,
especially.
thank
you.
