mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
members
of
the
court.
there
is
only
one
section
or
the
florida
vagrancy
statute
that
is
at
issue
here
and
that
is
the
section
which
proscribes
the
act
of
wandering
or
strolling
around
from
place
to
place
without
any
lawful
purpose
or
object.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
that
is
correct.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
that
is
correct.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
the
state
of
florida
does
not
recognize
the
same
transaction
concept
of
double
jeopardy.
that
is
what
you
are
asking
--
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
well,
perhaps
i
misunderstand
your
question.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
that
is
correct.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
different
elements
of
the
same
incident,
yes.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
yes.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
that
is
correct.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
that
is
correct.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
not
under
this
statute.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
well
there
being
abroad
for
that
purpose,
supports
this
conviction
here.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
it
would
have
been
no
case,
yes.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
well
let
us
put
it
this
way.
we
could
arrest
them
before
they
got
to
it
and
attempted
to—
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
yes,
i
do
not
understand
what
is
the
nature
of
your
question.
are
you
suggesting
it
is
objectionable
to
charge
him
with
two
charges?
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
this
is
not
a
general
practice
that
i
know
of
no.
there
are
other
types
cases
where
we
do
charge
two
or
three
charges
where
in
another
states
that
would
not
be
proper
because
of
their
double
jeopardy
concepts.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
but
in
this—
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
referring
to
what?
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
yes,
no
what
i
am
saying
is
in
some
states
our
statute
would
not
be
used
in
many
situations
where
it
is
used
or
could
be
used
in
state
of
florida.
i
believe
that
state
of
new
york
in
the
federal
crimes,
the
single
transaction
concept
applies
so
that
many
instances,
it
will
not
be
proper
to
charge
a
man
for
being
abroad
for
that
purpose
if
you
charged
him
for
actually
attempting
or
doing
the
criminal
act.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
yes.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
no
what
i
am
saying
is
there
is
no
federal
law
that
i
know
of
that
prohibits
or
that
requires
the
state
of
florida
to
recognize
the
single
transaction
concept.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
okay,
but
let
me
continue
then
because
this
does
not
cover
every
situation
of
that
issue
anyway.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
there
are
situation
where
you
could
feel
as
a
prosecuting
officer
that
you
could
have
proved
he
was
abroad
with
that
intent
but
you
might
feel
that
you
would
not
have
sufficient
evidence
to
prove
that
he
actually
perpetrated
the
act.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
no,
the
only
eye
witness
saw
i
am
going
to
and
coming
from
and
he
heard
the
noises
while
they
were
at
the
box
car.
the
seal
of
the
box
car
was
broken.
the
type
of
the
noise
that
this
officer
heard
with
that
noise
was
made
and
breaking
the
seal
box
car.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
yes
it
did.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
no
it
is
not
a
lesser
included
defense
it
is
entirely
separate
thing.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
no
i
do
not
believe
so.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
support
for
conviction
in
this
case?
we
could
have
convicted
him
on--we
could
have
convicted
this
two
petitioners
conceived
by
for
being
abroad
with
the
unlawful
purpose
without
been
ever
actually
having
got
there
and
committed
the
act.
is
that
as
to
answer
your
question.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
to
the—well
that
is
a
promise
search
purpose
supposedly
they
had
lived
in
tampa
florida
and
they
had
told
the
15
friends
of
theirs
that
they
are
going
to
go
over—
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
no
but
i
am
saying
you
could
prove
intent
for
they
actually
got
there
committed
the
act.
and
you
could
arrest
them
in
the
process
of
going
abroad
for
the
purpose
of
committing
that—
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
that
in
this
particular
case
that
was
a
circumstance
or
evidence
to
support
to
prove
of
the
intent
yes.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
that
is
correct.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
it
is
a
problem
and
circumstantial
proof,
you
could
have
the
testimony
of
those
15
people
plus
his
acts
of
going
abroad
if
he
was
going
abroad
in
the
direction
of
the
box
car
if
he
is
walking
down
the
river
of
the
property.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
you
cannot
prove
it
you
have
no
case
to
answer
that.
there
are
circumstances—
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
on
an
example—
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
the
same
way
of
(voice
overlap).
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
by
circumstance
of
evidence,
it
is
the
same
way
to
convict
a
man
for
waiting
there
--.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
well,
there
is
nothing
ambiguous
about
the
statute
your
honor.
that
would
be
our
position.
and
as
far
as
proving
a
man's
intent—
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
you
have
to
have
some
reason,
some
circumstance
or
evidence
or
some
statements
by
him
or
other
reasons
for
having
probable
cause
or
relief
that
he
is
violating
the
statute.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
it
is
rather
once
ignore—
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
why
should
we
drop
it
your
honor,
he
was
guilty
of
that
crime.
that
this
crime
is
in
state
of
florida
and
we
proved
it
and
we
convicted—
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
well
as
a
practical
matter
to
be
honest
with
you,
this
would
be
a
secondary
charge
if
you
failed
to
prove
the
actual
perpetration
of
the
attempt.
it
is
not
a
lesser
included
offense,
it
is
a
separate
act.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
yes,
i
did
not
prosecute
case
i
rather
imagine
the
only
reason—
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
yes
the
state
of
florida
prosecutor.
i
have
not
talked
to
people
who
made
the
decision
of
why
to
prosecute
this
person?
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
however
they
adopted
that
case
at
all
your
honor
it
would
seem
rather
apparent
to
me
that
the
objective
was
if
they
failed
to
prove
the
actual
perpetration
of
an
act
towards
accomplishing
this
intent
on
the
box
car
itself,
an
actual
attempt
to
break
and
enter,
and
they
still
convict
him
for
being
abroad
with
that
intent
because
he
went
there
with
that
purpose
and
the
evidence
established
that.
the
evidence
of
his
action
in
this
case—
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
well,
all
the
other
case
you
can
have
the
evidence
not
based
upon
action.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
i
see
you
probably
get
to
--
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
well,
if
there
is
i
am
not
aware
of
it,
but
even
if
there
is
a
reason
it
would
be
my
position
and
statement
that
florida
has
the
authority
under
this
statute
to
do
so.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
federal
law?
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
because
of
the
nature
of
the
evidence
in
this
case,
i
suppose
if
the
man
had
not
been
convicted
if
he
had
been
acquitted
of
an
attempt
and
there
was
other
evidence
other
than
his
attempt
to
establish
his
intent,
then
there
would
have
been
no
evidence
to
support
this
charge.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
there
would
have
been
no
evidence
to
support
count
one
the
vagrancy
charge.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
right.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
that
is
exactly
right.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
yes,
yes
we
do
have
--
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
i
do
not
know
why
the
reason
is
--
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
i
presume
it
would
be
yes.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
no
i
do
not,
they
are
all
separate
acts.
separate
crimes.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
he
could
have
committed
any
one
of
those
crimes
without
committing
the
other
two
let
us
put
it
that
way.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
because
of
the
mootness
issue
also--.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
no
your
honor.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
yes,
no
your
honor
if
i
had
a
good
argument
there
will
be
basically
just
that
i
missed
it.
i
also
am
inclined
to
urge
this
court
to
go
ahead
and
decide
the
case.
we
are
not
going
rely
on
mootness.
because
the
state
of
florida
is
in
the
process
and
has
been
for
a
while
of
redrafting
its
vagrancy
statute.
we
know
other
states
also
are
in
the
process.
there
is
some
confusion
among
state
legislatures
because
recent
opinions
by
this
court
and
they
need
some
guidelines
and
this
is
the
time
when
there
redrafting
the
vagrancy
statutes.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
the
question,
the
constitution
question
is
only
one—
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
yes,
i
mean
if
you
are
going
to
turn
around
and
say
that
single
translation
concept
is
required
for
constitutional
law.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
yes.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
both
of
them.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
both
are
completed,
that
is
correct.
i
am
not
prepared
to
urge
upon
you
that
there
are
no
consequences
upon
this
man,
they
do
not
give
him
standing
to
raise
it.
as
i
understand
state
law
there
are
certain
positions
in
state
government,
he
probably
could
not
obtain
it
because
of
this
conviction.
police
officer,
for
example
--.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
on
count
one,
well
i
am
not
sure—
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
yes
sure.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
i
am
not
positive,
no
your
honor.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
i
do
not
know
to
be
honest
your
honor.
let
us
go
back
to
the
wording
of
the
statute,
statutory
provision
of
bar.
the
florida
statute
provision,
the
one
under
consideration
on
its
face
refers
only
to
the
lawful
versus
the
unlawful
nature
of
one’s
purpose
or
object
for
being
abroad.
it
cannot
be
stated
that
there
is
no
ascertainable
standard
of
conduct
right
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
because
honestly
there
is
--
it
refers
only
to
the
lawfulness
or
unlawfulness
of
the
purpose
or
object
for
being
abroad.
the
question
was
raised
whether
or
not
a
person
would
be
required
in
florida
to
give
a
satisfactory
response
to
police
officers
upon
inquiry
under
suspicious
circumstances.
in
hadley
v
salkovitz
(ph),
i
believe
'65
or
'67
opinion
of
for
the
florida
supreme
court,
they
held
unconstitutional,
a
miami
city
ordinance
that
required
a
reasonable
explanation
towards
suspicious
circumstances
to
be
given
to
a
police
officer.
so
under
florida
law
there
is
no
requirement
that
you
explain
the
circumstances
to
a
police
officer
and
there
can
be
no
such
requirements.
now
chief
justice
or
rather
justice
irvin
of
the
florida
supreme
court
in
johnson
v
state
at
202
7
2d
stated
the
statute
does
not
purport
to
make
it
an
offense
for
a
person
merely
to
stroll
or
loiter
about
without
being
able
to
explain
to
the
satisfaction
of
an
arresting
officer,
or
a
judge,
or
a
jury
why
he
was
strolling
or
loitering.
now,
this
is
the
nature
of
florida
law.
the
police
officer
must
have
probable
cause
to
believe
the
person
is
abroad
with
an
unlawful
purpose
with
the
criminal
intent
in
other
words.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
yes,
that
is
substantial
difference.
that
term—
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
your
honor
the
term
used
there
by
the
third
district
is
in
itself
vague.
if
the
statute
said
that
i
would
be
in
a
very
bad
position
before
this
court.
if
the
statute
–
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
do
they
explain
what
they
are
talking
about?
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
well,
if
you
are
going
to
take
that
as
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
and
the
only
meaning
then
i
would
be
in
a
very
rough
position
here.
i
am
telling
you
that
the
statute
right
on
the
face
of
it
refers
only
to
the
lawful
versus
the
unlawful
major
of
conduct.
look
also
at
chief
justice
irvin's
concurring
opinion
in
the
florida
supreme
court
right
in
johnson
v.
state
and
i
think
you
will
find
a
clear
indication
there
that
is
not
a
correct
interpretation.
also,
in
the
instant
case,
the
florida
supreme
court
referred
to
justice
irvin's
concurring
opinion
and
said
that
it
was
a
well
considered
concurring
opinion
and
i
think
this
further
indicates
that
position
taken
by
chief
justice
irvin
is
the
position
of
the
florida’s
supreme
court
in
respect
to
this
law.
that
it
relates
only
to
unlawful
intent
for
being
abroad.
now,
referring
again
briefly
to
proving
one’s
intent,
a
man
can
be
convicted
for
what
the
state
of
his
mind
is
when
he
is
used
to
committing
a
certain
act.
you
can
convict
a
man
of
breaking
and
entering
with
an
intent
to
commit
rate
and
his
state
of
mind
at
the
time
of
breaking
and
entering
--
the
conviction
is
the
basis
of
his
intent.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
that
is
correct
your
honor,
that
is
correct,
very
correct.
his
intent
of
time
crossing
the
state
lines
and
so
forth.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
and
it
is
strictly
a
state
of
man's
mind,
what
he
is
thinking,
his
purpose,
which
support
criminal--.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
that
is
correct.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
no,
in
every
case
including
this
one,
it
takes
some
act
in
perpetration
actually,
all
that
--
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
going
abroad,
moving
from
place
to
place,
that
is
correct.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
among
other
things,
yes.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
that
is
true.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
that
is
correct.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
i
see
nothing
wrong
with
it,
that
you
can
convict
him
or
breaking
and
entering
the
house
with
the
intent
to
rape,
then
you
also
can
convict
him
for
walking
towards
that
house
with
that
intent
if
you
can
prove--case
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
according
to
the
crime,
rape
is
on
different
legal
status
from
breaking
and
entering
also.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
he
is
convicted
of
walking
down
the
street
with
a
criminal
intent.
there
is
a
difference
i
can
walk
down
the
street
with
the
intent
other
than
criminal
and
of
doing
nothing
of
danger
to
society.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
your
honor.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
your
honor
there
is
nothing
in
our
statute
that
authorizes
his
arrest
on
less
than
probable
cause.
other
vagrancy
statutes
which
you
have
either
stricken
down
or
determined
inapplicable
in
certain
situations
authorized
arrest
on
less
than
probable
cause
and
that
was
part
of
the
problem
with
the
statutes.
now,
the
big
police
officer
here
must
have
a
probable
cause
to
believe
that
person
is
abroad
with
criminal
intent.
in
the
palmer
case,
palmer
v
city
of
euclid,
here
the
statute
which
required
explanation,
reasonable
explanation
to
be
given
to
the
police
officer.
and
we
do
not
have
that
here
in
hadley
v.
salkovitz,
specifically
by
said
that
standard
cannot
be
applied
in
the
state
of
florida.
you
cannot
require
by
statute
or
ordinance
that
a
person
give
a
reasonable
explanation
of
that
conduct
to
a
police
officer.
so
we
do
not
have
that
problem.
there
must
be
a
probable
cause
to
support
the
police
officer
believing
they
are
abroad
with
the
criminal
intent.
it
should
be
noted
that
the
florida
statute
does
not
relate
to
loitering
in
an
unusual
manner
or
it
does
not
authorize
an
arrest
under
unusual
circumstances,
neither
does
it
require
once
to
dispel
like
policeman
suspicions
even
though
his
suspicions
maybe
based
upon
a
reasonable
suspicions
under
the
circumstances.
florida
vagrancy
statute
does
not
allow
arrest
on
anything
less
than
probable
cause
and
neither
does
it
make
arousing
a
policeman's
suspicions
a
crime.
much
of
the
problem
with
vagrancy
statutes
is
a
fear
about
many
people
and
many
judges
that
a
law
enforcement
officer
when
he
cannot
think
anything
to
charge
a
man
with,
he
is
just
going
to
say,
you
are
under
arrest
with
vagrancy.
and
there
is
a
fear
by
many,
this
will
be
abused
and
it
will
authorize
arrest
where
there
is
no
proper
grounds
for
arrest.
looking
at
the
provision
under
consideration
not
to
arrest
under
the
vagrancy
statute
but
the
very
provision
not
a
consideration,
there
is
nothing
in
the
wording
of
it,
that
authorizes
a
police
officer
to
arrest
you
simply
because
he
cannot
think
of
anything
to
charge
him
with.
there
is
nothing
mere
that
authorizes
an
arrest
on
anything
less
than
probable
cause
to
believe,
you
are
abroad
with
a
criminal
intent
and
he
must
have
knowledge
of
circumstance
or
evidence
to
that
effect.
unless
there
are
any
further
questions
in
court.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
my
position
is
that
this
all
the
--
wording
in
the
statute
authorizes
is
an
arrest
when
they
are
on
the
street
going
from
place
to
place
with
a
criminal
intent
and
the
state
does
have
that
power.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
that
is
correct.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
i
believe
that
is
enough,
it
is
a
very
difficult
problem
with
proof
in
many
cases.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
when
a
person
sets
out
with
a
purpose
of
committing
the
crime
yes.
what
could
be
a
more
appropriate
crime
prevention
statute?
i
used
a
example
in
my
brief,
a
police
officer
is
informed
that
john
smith,
let
us
say
is
going
to
rob
a
liquor
store.
he
is
going
to
rob
it,
he
is
going
to
be
on
the
robs
tomorrow
night,
tonight
he
is
going
to
go
there
and
case
the
joint,
he
is
no
going
to
do
anything
he
is
just
going
to
case
it
and
see
how
the
customer
come
in
and
how
to
set
up
his
robbery,
what
is
there
in
constitutional
that
you
stop
the
officer
from
arresting
the
man
tonight
when
he
is
on
there
for
wandering
and
strolling
around
with
an
unlawful
purpose
rather
than
waiting
until
the
man
comes
armed
tomorrow
night
and
either
try
to
stop
before
he
gets
in
or
stop
when
he
is
in
good
place
of
the
act.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
that
issue
is
not
raised
in
the
petitioner's
position.
i
am
saying
there
are
many
positions,
situations
when
this
is
a
perfectly
proper
crime
prevention
statute.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
well,
my
position
is
that
he
only
raised
the
vagueness
issue
and
preserved
it
for
this
court.
starting
at
page
three
of
the
appendix
to
this
case,
his
oral
motion
in
court
refers
only
to
the
vagueness
of
the
statute
not
to
its
over
breath.
and
the
trial
court
made
a
written
order
attempting
to
put
on
a
record
this
oral
motion
and
the
denial
of
it
and
it
is
from
there
that
this
case
comes
before
this
court.
it
is
my
position
that
only
the
vagueness
and
not
the
over
breath
is
involved.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
yes.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
what
would
you
arrest
him
for?
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
no,
the
night
before
he
is
there,
a
case
is
enjoined
--
unarmed.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
that
is
all
he
has
a
right
to
do
--.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
and
if
there
is
any
police
officers
sitting
there
and
knowing
that
man
is
walking
around
with
an
intent
to
commit
that
crime.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
your
honor—
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
your
honor--.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
at
what
point?
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
well,
actually
there
are
two
elements,
they
have
to
prove
he
was
abroad
going
from
place
to
place
with
that
intent
--
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
no,
my
point
is
if
he
is
sitting
in
his
house
just
thinking
about
it,
there
is
no
crime
on
a
florida
statute.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
no.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
no
you
cannot
pick
him
up
just
because
of
the
unusual
circumstance
do.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
okay,
thank
you.
that
is
for
conclusion.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
members
of
the
court.
there
is
only
one
section
or
the
florida
vagrancy
statute
that
is
at
issue
here
and
that
is
the
section
which
proscribes
the
act
of
wandering
or
strolling
around
from
place
to
place
without
any
lawful
purpose
or
object.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
that
is
correct.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
that
is
correct.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
the
state
of
florida
does
not
recognize
the
same
transaction
concept
of
double
jeopardy.
that
is
what
you
are
asking
--
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
well,
perhaps
i
misunderstand
your
question.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
that
is
correct.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
different
elements
of
the
same
incident,
yes.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
yes.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
that
is
correct.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
that
is
correct.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
not
under
this
statute.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
well
there
being
abroad
for
that
purpose,
supports
this
conviction
here.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
it
would
have
been
no
case,
yes.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
well
let
us
put
it
this
way.
we
could
arrest
them
before
they
got
to
it
and
attempted
to—
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
yes,
i
do
not
understand
what
is
the
nature
of
your
question.
are
you
suggesting
it
is
objectionable
to
charge
him
with
two
charges?
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
this
is
not
a
general
practice
that
i
know
of
no.
there
are
other
types
cases
where
we
do
charge
two
or
three
charges
where
in
another
states
that
would
not
be
proper
because
of
their
double
jeopardy
concepts.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
but
in
this—
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
referring
to
what?
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
yes,
no
what
i
am
saying
is
in
some
states
our
statute
would
not
be
used
in
many
situations
where
it
is
used
or
could
be
used
in
state
of
florida.
i
believe
that
state
of
new
york
in
the
federal
crimes,
the
single
transaction
concept
applies
so
that
many
instances,
it
will
not
be
proper
to
charge
a
man
for
being
abroad
for
that
purpose
if
you
charged
him
for
actually
attempting
or
doing
the
criminal
act.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
yes.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
no
what
i
am
saying
is
there
is
no
federal
law
that
i
know
of
that
prohibits
or
that
requires
the
state
of
florida
to
recognize
the
single
transaction
concept.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
okay,
but
let
me
continue
then
because
this
does
not
cover
every
situation
of
that
issue
anyway.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
there
are
situation
where
you
could
feel
as
a
prosecuting
officer
that
you
could
have
proved
he
was
abroad
with
that
intent
but
you
might
feel
that
you
would
not
have
sufficient
evidence
to
prove
that
he
actually
perpetrated
the
act.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
no,
the
only
eye
witness
saw
i
am
going
to
and
coming
from
and
he
heard
the
noises
while
they
were
at
the
box
car.
the
seal
of
the
box
car
was
broken.
the
type
of
the
noise
that
this
officer
heard
with
that
noise
was
made
and
breaking
the
seal
box
car.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
yes
it
did.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
no
it
is
not
a
lesser
included
defense
it
is
entirely
separate
thing.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
no
i
do
not
believe
so.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
support
for
conviction
in
this
case?
we
could
have
convicted
him
on--we
could
have
convicted
this
two
petitioners
conceived
by
for
being
abroad
with
the
unlawful
purpose
without
been
ever
actually
having
got
there
and
committed
the
act.
is
that
as
to
answer
your
question.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
to
the—well
that
is
a
promise
search
purpose
supposedly
they
had
lived
in
tampa
florida
and
they
had
told
the
15
friends
of
theirs
that
they
are
going
to
go
over—
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
no
but
i
am
saying
you
could
prove
intent
for
they
actually
got
there
committed
the
act.
and
you
could
arrest
them
in
the
process
of
going
abroad
for
the
purpose
of
committing
that—
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
that
in
this
particular
case
that
was
a
circumstance
or
evidence
to
support
to
prove
of
the
intent
yes.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
that
is
correct.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
it
is
a
problem
and
circumstantial
proof,
you
could
have
the
testimony
of
those
15
people
plus
his
acts
of
going
abroad
if
he
was
going
abroad
in
the
direction
of
the
box
car
if
he
is
walking
down
the
river
of
the
property.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
you
cannot
prove
it
you
have
no
case
to
answer
that.
there
are
circumstances—
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
on
an
example—
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
the
same
way
of
(voice
overlap).
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
by
circumstance
of
evidence,
it
is
the
same
way
to
convict
a
man
for
waiting
there
--.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
well,
there
is
nothing
ambiguous
about
the
statute
your
honor.
that
would
be
our
position.
and
as
far
as
proving
a
man's
intent—
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
you
have
to
have
some
reason,
some
circumstance
or
evidence
or
some
statements
by
him
or
other
reasons
for
having
probable
cause
or
relief
that
he
is
violating
the
statute.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
it
is
rather
once
ignore—
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
why
should
we
drop
it
your
honor,
he
was
guilty
of
that
crime.
that
this
crime
is
in
state
of
florida
and
we
proved
it
and
we
convicted—
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
well
as
a
practical
matter
to
be
honest
with
you,
this
would
be
a
secondary
charge
if
you
failed
to
prove
the
actual
perpetration
of
the
attempt.
it
is
not
a
lesser
included
offense,
it
is
a
separate
act.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
yes,
i
did
not
prosecute
case
i
rather
imagine
the
only
reason—
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
yes
the
state
of
florida
prosecutor.
i
have
not
talked
to
people
who
made
the
decision
of
why
to
prosecute
this
person?
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
however
they
adopted
that
case
at
all
your
honor
it
would
seem
rather
apparent
to
me
that
the
objective
was
if
they
failed
to
prove
the
actual
perpetration
of
an
act
towards
accomplishing
this
intent
on
the
box
car
itself,
an
actual
attempt
to
break
and
enter,
and
they
still
convict
him
for
being
abroad
with
that
intent
because
he
went
there
with
that
purpose
and
the
evidence
established
that.
the
evidence
of
his
action
in
this
case—
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
well,
all
the
other
case
you
can
have
the
evidence
not
based
upon
action.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
i
see
you
probably
get
to
--
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
well,
if
there
is
i
am
not
aware
of
it,
but
even
if
there
is
a
reason
it
would
be
my
position
and
statement
that
florida
has
the
authority
under
this
statute
to
do
so.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
federal
law?
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
because
of
the
nature
of
the
evidence
in
this
case,
i
suppose
if
the
man
had
not
been
convicted
if
he
had
been
acquitted
of
an
attempt
and
there
was
other
evidence
other
than
his
attempt
to
establish
his
intent,
then
there
would
have
been
no
evidence
to
support
this
charge.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
there
would
have
been
no
evidence
to
support
count
one
the
vagrancy
charge.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
right.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
that
is
exactly
right.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
yes,
yes
we
do
have
--
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
i
do
not
know
why
the
reason
is
--
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
i
presume
it
would
be
yes.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
no
i
do
not,
they
are
all
separate
acts.
separate
crimes.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
he
could
have
committed
any
one
of
those
crimes
without
committing
the
other
two
let
us
put
it
that
way.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
because
of
the
mootness
issue
also--.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
no
your
honor.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
yes,
no
your
honor
if
i
had
a
good
argument
there
will
be
basically
just
that
i
missed
it.
i
also
am
inclined
to
urge
this
court
to
go
ahead
and
decide
the
case.
we
are
not
going
rely
on
mootness.
because
the
state
of
florida
is
in
the
process
and
has
been
for
a
while
of
redrafting
its
vagrancy
statute.
we
know
other
states
also
are
in
the
process.
there
is
some
confusion
among
state
legislatures
because
recent
opinions
by
this
court
and
they
need
some
guidelines
and
this
is
the
time
when
there
redrafting
the
vagrancy
statutes.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
the
question,
the
constitution
question
is
only
one—
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
yes,
i
mean
if
you
are
going
to
turn
around
and
say
that
single
translation
concept
is
required
for
constitutional
law.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
yes.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
both
of
them.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
both
are
completed,
that
is
correct.
i
am
not
prepared
to
urge
upon
you
that
there
are
no
consequences
upon
this
man,
they
do
not
give
him
standing
to
raise
it.
as
i
understand
state
law
there
are
certain
positions
in
state
government,
he
probably
could
not
obtain
it
because
of
this
conviction.
police
officer,
for
example
--.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
on
count
one,
well
i
am
not
sure—
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
yes
sure.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
i
am
not
positive,
no
your
honor.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
i
do
not
know
to
be
honest
your
honor.
let
us
go
back
to
the
wording
of
the
statute,
statutory
provision
of
bar.
the
florida
statute
provision,
the
one
under
consideration
on
its
face
refers
only
to
the
lawful
versus
the
unlawful
nature
of
one’s
purpose
or
object
for
being
abroad.
it
cannot
be
stated
that
there
is
no
ascertainable
standard
of
conduct
right
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
because
honestly
there
is
--
it
refers
only
to
the
lawfulness
or
unlawfulness
of
the
purpose
or
object
for
being
abroad.
the
question
was
raised
whether
or
not
a
person
would
be
required
in
florida
to
give
a
satisfactory
response
to
police
officers
upon
inquiry
under
suspicious
circumstances.
in
hadley
v
salkovitz
(ph),
i
believe
'65
or
'67
opinion
of
for
the
florida
supreme
court,
they
held
unconstitutional,
a
miami
city
ordinance
that
required
a
reasonable
explanation
towards
suspicious
circumstances
to
be
given
to
a
police
officer.
so
under
florida
law
there
is
no
requirement
that
you
explain
the
circumstances
to
a
police
officer
and
there
can
be
no
such
requirements.
now
chief
justice
or
rather
justice
irvin
of
the
florida
supreme
court
in
johnson
v
state
at
202
7
2d
stated
the
statute
does
not
purport
to
make
it
an
offense
for
a
person
merely
to
stroll
or
loiter
about
without
being
able
to
explain
to
the
satisfaction
of
an
arresting
officer,
or
a
judge,
or
a
jury
why
he
was
strolling
or
loitering.
now,
this
is
the
nature
of
florida
law.
the
police
officer
must
have
probable
cause
to
believe
the
person
is
abroad
with
an
unlawful
purpose
with
the
criminal
intent
in
other
words.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
yes,
that
is
substantial
difference.
that
term—
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
your
honor
the
term
used
there
by
the
third
district
is
in
itself
vague.
if
the
statute
said
that
i
would
be
in
a
very
bad
position
before
this
court.
if
the
statute
–
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
do
they
explain
what
they
are
talking
about?
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
well,
if
you
are
going
to
take
that
as
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
and
the
only
meaning
then
i
would
be
in
a
very
rough
position
here.
i
am
telling
you
that
the
statute
right
on
the
face
of
it
refers
only
to
the
lawful
versus
the
unlawful
major
of
conduct.
look
also
at
chief
justice
irvin's
concurring
opinion
in
the
florida
supreme
court
right
in
johnson
v.
state
and
i
think
you
will
find
a
clear
indication
there
that
is
not
a
correct
interpretation.
also,
in
the
instant
case,
the
florida
supreme
court
referred
to
justice
irvin's
concurring
opinion
and
said
that
it
was
a
well
considered
concurring
opinion
and
i
think
this
further
indicates
that
position
taken
by
chief
justice
irvin
is
the
position
of
the
florida’s
supreme
court
in
respect
to
this
law.
that
it
relates
only
to
unlawful
intent
for
being
abroad.
now,
referring
again
briefly
to
proving
one’s
intent,
a
man
can
be
convicted
for
what
the
state
of
his
mind
is
when
he
is
used
to
committing
a
certain
act.
you
can
convict
a
man
of
breaking
and
entering
with
an
intent
to
commit
rate
and
his
state
of
mind
at
the
time
of
breaking
and
entering
--
the
conviction
is
the
basis
of
his
intent.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
that
is
correct
your
honor,
that
is
correct,
very
correct.
his
intent
of
time
crossing
the
state
lines
and
so
forth.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
and
it
is
strictly
a
state
of
man's
mind,
what
he
is
thinking,
his
purpose,
which
support
criminal--.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
that
is
correct.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
no,
in
every
case
including
this
one,
it
takes
some
act
in
perpetration
actually,
all
that
--
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
going
abroad,
moving
from
place
to
place,
that
is
correct.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
among
other
things,
yes.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
that
is
true.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
that
is
correct.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
i
see
nothing
wrong
with
it,
that
you
can
convict
him
or
breaking
and
entering
the
house
with
the
intent
to
rape,
then
you
also
can
convict
him
for
walking
towards
that
house
with
that
intent
if
you
can
prove--case
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
according
to
the
crime,
rape
is
on
different
legal
status
from
breaking
and
entering
also.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
he
is
convicted
of
walking
down
the
street
with
a
criminal
intent.
there
is
a
difference
i
can
walk
down
the
street
with
the
intent
other
than
criminal
and
of
doing
nothing
of
danger
to
society.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
your
honor.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
your
honor
there
is
nothing
in
our
statute
that
authorizes
his
arrest
on
less
than
probable
cause.
other
vagrancy
statutes
which
you
have
either
stricken
down
or
determined
inapplicable
in
certain
situations
authorized
arrest
on
less
than
probable
cause
and
that
was
part
of
the
problem
with
the
statutes.
now,
the
big
police
officer
here
must
have
a
probable
cause
to
believe
that
person
is
abroad
with
criminal
intent.
in
the
palmer
case,
palmer
v
city
of
euclid,
here
the
statute
which
required
explanation,
reasonable
explanation
to
be
given
to
the
police
officer.
and
we
do
not
have
that
here
in
hadley
v.
salkovitz,
specifically
by
said
that
standard
cannot
be
applied
in
the
state
of
florida.
you
cannot
require
by
statute
or
ordinance
that
a
person
give
a
reasonable
explanation
of
that
conduct
to
a
police
officer.
so
we
do
not
have
that
problem.
there
must
be
a
probable
cause
to
support
the
police
officer
believing
they
are
abroad
with
the
criminal
intent.
it
should
be
noted
that
the
florida
statute
does
not
relate
to
loitering
in
an
unusual
manner
or
it
does
not
authorize
an
arrest
under
unusual
circumstances,
neither
does
it
require
once
to
dispel
like
policeman
suspicions
even
though
his
suspicions
maybe
based
upon
a
reasonable
suspicions
under
the
circumstances.
florida
vagrancy
statute
does
not
allow
arrest
on
anything
less
than
probable
cause
and
neither
does
it
make
arousing
a
policeman's
suspicions
a
crime.
much
of
the
problem
with
vagrancy
statutes
is
a
fear
about
many
people
and
many
judges
that
a
law
enforcement
officer
when
he
cannot
think
anything
to
charge
a
man
with,
he
is
just
going
to
say,
you
are
under
arrest
with
vagrancy.
and
there
is
a
fear
by
many,
this
will
be
abused
and
it
will
authorize
arrest
where
there
is
no
proper
grounds
for
arrest.
looking
at
the
provision
under
consideration
not
to
arrest
under
the
vagrancy
statute
but
the
very
provision
not
a
consideration,
there
is
nothing
in
the
wording
of
it,
that
authorizes
a
police
officer
to
arrest
you
simply
because
he
cannot
think
of
anything
to
charge
him
with.
there
is
nothing
mere
that
authorizes
an
arrest
on
anything
less
than
probable
cause
to
believe,
you
are
abroad
with
a
criminal
intent
and
he
must
have
knowledge
of
circumstance
or
evidence
to
that
effect.
unless
there
are
any
further
questions
in
court.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
my
position
is
that
this
all
the
--
wording
in
the
statute
authorizes
is
an
arrest
when
they
are
on
the
street
going
from
place
to
place
with
a
criminal
intent
and
the
state
does
have
that
power.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
that
is
correct.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
i
believe
that
is
enough,
it
is
a
very
difficult
problem
with
proof
in
many
cases.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
when
a
person
sets
out
with
a
purpose
of
committing
the
crime
yes.
what
could
be
a
more
appropriate
crime
prevention
statute?
i
used
a
example
in
my
brief,
a
police
officer
is
informed
that
john
smith,
let
us
say
is
going
to
rob
a
liquor
store.
he
is
going
to
rob
it,
he
is
going
to
be
on
the
robs
tomorrow
night,
tonight
he
is
going
to
go
there
and
case
the
joint,
he
is
no
going
to
do
anything
he
is
just
going
to
case
it
and
see
how
the
customer
come
in
and
how
to
set
up
his
robbery,
what
is
there
in
constitutional
that
you
stop
the
officer
from
arresting
the
man
tonight
when
he
is
on
there
for
wandering
and
strolling
around
with
an
unlawful
purpose
rather
than
waiting
until
the
man
comes
armed
tomorrow
night
and
either
try
to
stop
before
he
gets
in
or
stop
when
he
is
in
good
place
of
the
act.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
that
issue
is
not
raised
in
the
petitioner's
position.
i
am
saying
there
are
many
positions,
situations
when
this
is
a
perfectly
proper
crime
prevention
statute.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
well,
my
position
is
that
he
only
raised
the
vagueness
issue
and
preserved
it
for
this
court.
starting
at
page
three
of
the
appendix
to
this
case,
his
oral
motion
in
court
refers
only
to
the
vagueness
of
the
statute
not
to
its
over
breath.
and
the
trial
court
made
a
written
order
attempting
to
put
on
a
record
this
oral
motion
and
the
denial
of
it
and
it
is
from
there
that
this
case
comes
before
this
court.
it
is
my
position
that
only
the
vagueness
and
not
the
over
breath
is
involved.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
yes.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
what
would
you
arrest
him
for?
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
no,
the
night
before
he
is
there,
a
case
is
enjoined
--
unarmed.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
that
is
all
he
has
a
right
to
do
--.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
and
if
there
is
any
police
officers
sitting
there
and
knowing
that
man
is
walking
around
with
an
intent
to
commit
that
crime.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
your
honor—
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
your
honor--.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
at
what
point?
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
well,
actually
there
are
two
elements,
they
have
to
prove
he
was
abroad
going
from
place
to
place
with
that
intent
--
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
no,
my
point
is
if
he
is
sitting
in
his
house
just
thinking
about
it,
there
is
no
crime
on
a
florida
statute.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
no.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
no
you
cannot
pick
him
up
just
because
of
the
unusual
circumstance
do.
mr.
nelson
e.
bailey
okay,
thank
you.
that
is
for
conclusion.
