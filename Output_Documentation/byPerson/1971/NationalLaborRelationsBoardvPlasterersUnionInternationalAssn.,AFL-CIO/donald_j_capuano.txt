mr.
donald
j.
capuano
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
board,
in
its
argument
arrived
to
conclusion,
mentioned
in
answer
to
a
question
that
23
years
of
nlrb
precedent,
which
is
involved
in
this
case.
it
is
certainly
true
that
this
decision
or
the
board’s
position
in
this
issue
has
been
followed
for
23
years.
however,
i
think
it
is
fair
to
state
that
there
is
more
reasoned
analysis
in
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
which
is
on
review
here
than
there
is
in
the
sum
total
of
every
case,
the
nlrb
has
decided
on
this
issue,
in
23
years.
the
nlrb
simply
has
refused
to
analyze
its
position,
the
legislative
history,
this
court's
decision
in
cbs,
simply
as
what
the
petitioner
states
in
his
brief,
couches
its
decisions
in
statutory
terms
always
denying
the
voluntary
adjustment
procedure,
any
credibility
when
the
two
unions
or
two
labor
groups
are
bound.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
i
think
mr.
chief
justice,
the
courts
have
allowed
the
board
wide
latitude
in
dealing
with
practicalities
but
i
think
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
policy,
a
policy
that
congress
set
down
in
section
10
(k)
and
therefore,
the
board
does
not
have
the
latitude
it
would,
if
it
was
simply
applying
a
mechanical
doctrine.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
no,
i
agree
with
that
statement
because
i
believe,
what
judge
leventhal
was
stating
there,
is
what
the
legislative
history
reflects
and
that
is,
that
this
section
of
the
act
and
as
this
court
has
said,
in
fact,
the
whole
dominant
theme
throughout
section
8(b),
8
(b)
(4)
is
to
protect
neutral
employers.
just
last
term,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
local
825
operating
engineers
case
at
400
u.s.,
this
court
again
reiterate
it,
what
it
said
in
national
woodwork
and
we
believe
it
was
actually,
affirming,
re-affirming
what
it
said
in
cbs.
the
protection
of
this
section
of
the
act
10
(k)
and
8
(b)
(4)
is
to
protect
an
employer's
neutral
interest.
now,
judge
leventhal
recognized,
and
we
certainly
have
conceded
in
our
brief
that
there
are
employers
who
have
preferences.
of
course,
there
are,
no
one
would
deny
that
and
judge
leventhal
recognized
it,
but
the
act,
this
particular
section
of
the
act,
for
these
two
sections
were
not
designed
to
protect
that
preference.
they
were
only
designed
to
protect
the
neutrality
of
that
employer,
when
he
is
caught
between
the
two
warring
unions.
now,
he
may
also
have
a
preference,
but
he
can
support
that
preference,
once
the
10
(k)
decision
is
decided
where
the
two
unions
agree
voluntarily,
then
one
union
goes
back
to
deal
with
the
employer
and
at
that
point
under
the
whole
structure
of
the
act,
his
economic
interest
can
be
protected
by
self
help
and
we
believe
that
is
exactly
what
judge
leventhal
was
saying
and
that
is
exactly
the
intent
of
the
whole
act.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
oh
yes,
justice
marshall,
the
plasters
were
working
there
for
a
plastering
contractor.
they
are
on
that
job,
in
fact
--
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
they
were
the
ones
who
put
the
scratch
coat
which
is
the
preliminary
coat
on
the
wall
at
to
which
the
tile
setters
came
and
put
their
float
coat
on.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
well,
now,
they
were
not
regular
employees
of
the
tile
setting
contractor,
they
were
regular
employees
of
the
plastering
contractor
who
also
had
a
--
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
yes,
who
also
had
a
sub
--
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
no
sir.
that
is
correct!
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
yes
sir,
he
has
--
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
he
has
the
interest
but
congress
set
--
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
no,
i
say,
the
congress
said
in
the
10
(k)
proceeding,
that
is
not
were
his
interest
was
going
to
be
protected.
his
interest
was
going
to
be
protected
after
the
two
unions
had
settled
between
themselves,
this
dispute
and
then,
one
union
would
go
back
and
deal
with
the
employer.
i
mean,
his
interest
is
being
protected
in
this
manner
just
as
if
his
tile
setters
employees
during
the
course
of
that
job
said
they
wanted
20
cents
an
hour
more.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
that
may
very
well
be
the
case,
yes,
but
that
is
not
the
interest
that
congress
should
be
protected.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
because
you
see
justice
marshall,
if
congress
had
wanted
to
give
him
that
sort
of
protection,
they
would
have
drafted
10
(k),
so
that
he
was
bound
by
the
decision.
as
it
stands
now,
under
section
10
(k),
the
employer
can
demand
a
board
hearing,
he
can
demand
a
board
hearing,
i
mean,
a
board
order
which
is
going
to
bind
the
unions,
but
which
then
the
employer
can
completely
ignore.
now,
we
think
if
congress
wanted
to
do
which
you
suggested,
they
would
have
said,
alright,
mr.
employer,
you
are
now
going
to
be
bound
by
this
10
(k)
award,
but
congress
was
not
about
to
adopt
any
form
of
compulsory
arbitration
binding
the
employer
and
the
unions
in
the
act.
now,
we
think
that
the
language
of
section
10
(k)
supports
our
position
very
clearly.
the
last
sentence
states,
and
we
have
quoted
it
in
our
brief
on
page
8,
and
our
brief
is
the
red
one,
“upon
compliance
by
the
parties
to
the
dispute
with
the
decision
of
the
board
or
upon
such
voluntary
adjustment
of
the
dispute
such
charge
shall
be
dismissed.”
well,
as
i
just
indicated,
the
employer
does
not
have
to
be
complying
with
the
decision
at
all.
if
the
two
unions
involved
comply
the
charge
is
going
to
be
dismissed,
the
employer
can
go
on
making
the
assignment
as
he
pleases.
now,
clearly,
if
the
employer
does
not
have
to
comply,
certainly
the
words
parties
to
the
dispute
in
that
last
sentence
cannot
include
the
employer.
the
first
sentence
also
uses
the
same
phrase,
parties
to
such
dispute.
now,
again,
if
in
the
last
sentence,
it
means
only
the
disputing
unions
are
labor
groups,
we
submit,
it
cannot
mean
anything
differently
in
the
first
sentence,
but
more
importantly,
the
first
sentence
with
regard
to
the
word
dispute,
states
and
we
have
this
quoted
at
page
10
of
our
brief,
“the
board
is
empowered
and
directed
to
hear
and
determine
the
dispute
out
of
which
such
unfair
labor
practice
shall
have
arisen.
now,
the
board
in
its
brief
and
argument,
has
said,
well,
the
dispute
there
means
the
jurisdictional
strike.
we
submit
the
dispute
cannot
mean
the
jurisdictional
strike.
that
the
jurisdictional
strike
is
the
unfair
labor
practice
and
if
you
made
a
substitution
of
terms
in
that
very
sentence,
it
would
read
that
the
board
is
empowered
and
directed
to
hear
and
determine
the
dispute
out
of
which
such
strike
arouse.
the
strike
is
the
unfair
labor
practice
and
i
think
a
short
analogy
would
be
in
a
discriminatory
discharge
case,
that
is
an
unfair
labor
practice.
the
discriminatory
discharge
itself
is
the
unfair
labor
practice.
the
unfair
labor
practice
does
not
arise
out
of
the
discriminatory
discharge
and
we
simply
cannot
understand
the
basis
of
the
board’s
argument
that
the
strike
equals
a
dispute.
and
we
also
believe
that
this
court,
in
cbs
answered
that
question
and
in
answering
that
question,
it
was
a
necessary
predicate
to
the
court's
decision
in
cbs
because
i
think
i
should
go
back
a
little
bit
prior
to
cbs,
to
recall
just
what
the
board
was
doing.
for
13
years,
the
board,
when
it
held
the
section
10
(k)
case,
was
simply
determining
the
validity
of
the
jurisdictional
strike.
the
board
would
state
in
its
decision,
whether
the
striking
union
was
entitled
to
the
work
because
of
an
outstanding
board
order,
certification
or
collective
bargaining
agreement.
if
it
was
not,
then
the
employer's
assignment
was
affirmed
every
time.
therefore,
the
board
was
equating
the
dispute
that
it
had
to
determine
with
the
validity
of
a
jurisdictional
strike.
when
the
case
came
to
this
court,
justice
black
writing
for
the
unanimous
court,
very
clearly
and
necessarily
determined
what
the
word
dispute
means
in
10
(k)
and
if
i
make
quote
him
and
this
is
at
the
bottom
of
page
14
of
our
brief,
“in
the
clause,
the
dispute
out
of
which
such
unfair
labor
practice
shall
have
arisen,
can
have
no
other
meaning
except
a
jurisdictional
dispute
under
section
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
which
is
a
dispute
between
two
or
more
groups
of
employees
over
which
is
entitled
to
do
certain
work
for
an
employer.
now,
we
submit
--
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
i
believe
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
way
that
it
is
written,
referring
specifically
to
the
clause
in
section
10
(k)
that
he
is
clearly
talking
about
the
use
of
the
term
in
10
(k).
now,
of
course
in
another
situation
not
involved
with
10
(k),
dispute
may
mean
something
else,
but
this
is
why
we
believe
that
this
question
as
to
what
dispute
means
in
10
(k)
has
been
settled
because
the
court
there
was
specifically
referring
to
10
(k).
with
regard
to
the
voluntary
adjustment
or
abstention
provision
of
10
(k),
this
court
in
cbs
also
made
reference
to
it
and
explained
that
the
court
--
the
board
in
the
case
before
the
court
then,
had
to
hold
a
10
(k)
hearing
because,
and
i
am
paraphrasing
the
court,
because
the
two
unions,
the
technicians
and
the
state
(inaudible)
were
not
able
to
settle
their
dispute.
the
court
stated,
and
again
this
is
quoted
on
page
14
of
our
brief,
“section
10
(k)
offers
strong
inducements
to
quarreling
unions
to
settle
their
differences
by
directing
dismissal
of
unfair
labor
practice
charges
upon
a
voluntary
adjustment
of
jurisdictional
disputes.”
the
court
of
appeals
here
recognized
that
once
it
had
determined,
what
dispute
is
covered
by
section
10
(k),
the
parties
to
the
dispute
for
the
purposes
of
the
abstention
provision
necessarily
means
the
two
disputing
labor
groups
are
labor
unions.
it
can
have
no
other
meaning.
now,
we
rely
of
course,
as
i
have
stated
on
cbs
and
we
submit
that
this
court
in
cbs,
relied
upon
the
legislative
history
of
this
act
and
the
thrust
of
the
act.
the
court,
went
into
the
legislative
history,
read
it
thoroughly
and
while
we
do
not
think
a
reanalysis
is
necessary
here,
i
think
briefly,
i
would
like
to
say
a
few
words
about
the
legislative
history.
the
house
bill,
that
was
introduced
in
1947,
did
not
contain
any
provision
similar
to
section
10
(k).
section
10
(k)
was
introduced
in
the
senate
by
senator
morse.
unfortunately
in
this
particular
situation,
we
have
a
very
clear
statement
as
to
where
the
idea
for
section
10
(k)
developed.
senator
morse
explained
in
the
legislative
history,
that
while
he
was
a
member
of
the
war
labor
board,
one
night,
a
very
serious
jurisdictional
dispute
occurred
between
two
unions
which
resulted
in
a
work
stoppage.
senator
morse
stated
that
the
war
labor
board
called
the
unions
together
and
they
told
him
to
get
the
men
back
to
work
or
if
they
did
not,
the
war
labor
board
was
going
to
appoint
an
arbitrator
to
settle
the
dispute.
now,
the
only
fair
reading
from
this
point
of
the
legislative
history
is
that
the
two
unions
got
together
and
settled
the
dispute
because
there
is
somewhat
of
a
gap
there.
senator
morse
simply
goes
on
to
say,
the
men
went
back
to
work,
but
i
think
the
only
fair
reading
is
that
they
got
together,
settled
dispute
then
they
went
back
to
work.
but
in
any
event,
senator
morse
then
goes
on
to
explain
that
he
decided,
the
war
labor
board
ought
to
have
a
policy
to
avoid
these
situations
in
the
future.
so,
he
proposed
a
resolution
which
became
that
policy,
which
said
to
the
two
unions
involved,
you
have
24
hours
to
settle
the
jurisdictional
dispute
without
economic
action
and
if
you
do
not,
we
are
going
to
appoint
an
arbitrator
to
settle
it
for
you
and
it
is
going
to
be
binding
on
you.
and
if
he
explained,
he
wanted
to
get
the
same
incentive
into
the
act
and
that
is
why
he
proposed
section
10
(k),
which
was
adopted,
almost
completely
the
way
he
proposed
it.
there
is
only
one
deletion
and
that
is
that
senator
morse
proposed
that
if
the
two
unions,
excuse
me,
if
the
parties
in
the
language
of
the
statute,
could
not
agree
upon
a
settlement
of
the
dispute,
the
board
could
hear
the
dispute
itself
or
the
board
could
appoint
an
arbitrator
to
hear
it.
the
provision
allowing
the
board
to
appoint
an
arbitrator
was
deleted.
it
was
deleted
without
comment
in
the
legislative,
in
the
conference,
but
we
submit
that
we
had
a
very
clear
statement
from
senator
morse
as
to
what
the
reason
for
section
10
(k)
was
being
put
into
the
act
or
being
proposed.
other
legislators,
senator
murray,
for
example,
also
echoed
his
hopes,
that
this
provision,
section
10
(k)
would
encourage
unions
to
set
up
machinery,
to
settle
jurisdictional
disputes
themselves
before
the
governmental
action
was
necessary.
in
affect
then,
congress
established
the
scheme
for
the
settlement
of
jurisdictional
disputes
which
resulted
in
work
stoppages,
which
we
think
is
clearly
discerned
from
the
statute
and
the
legislative
history.
it
has
got
four
steps.
first,
there
is
a
jurisdictional
dispute
between
two
unions
which
results
in
a
work
stoppage.
congress
said
that
work
stoppage
is
going
to
be
halted
by
a
10
(l)
injunction.
second
step;
congress
proposed
10
(k).
it
said
in
section
10
(k),
we
are
going
to
have
an
opportunity
for
the
two
unions
to
get
together
and
resolve
their
dispute,
the
abstention
provision.
step
three;
if
the
two
unions
or
labor
groups
cannot
resolve
their
dispute
themselves,
then
the
nlrb
is
going
to
have
to
make
a
binding
determination
of
that
dispute,
in
a
10
(k)
hearing.
step
number
four;
out
of
the
voluntary
mechanism
or
out
of
the
10
(k)
hearing
before
the
board,
one
union
will
prevail.
one
union
will
go
back
and
deal
with
the
employer,
will
negotiate.
each
will
be
able
to
use
their
own
economic
weapons
at
that
point.
congress
was
not
imposing
substantive
terms
on
either
the
unions
or
the
employers.
congress
recognizes
that
what
it
wanted
to
do
was
to
protect
the
neutral
employer,
the
employer
caught
in
the
middle.
the
helpless
victim,
between
the
two
warring
unions.
the
legislative
history
beginning
even
with
the
house
statements
and
the
house
report,
all
show
the
congress
was
concerned
about
the
neutral
employer,
the
innocent
victim
of
the
warring
unions,
the
helpless
victim
caught
between
these
two
unions
and
as
justice
black
said
in
cbs,
the
employer
who
is
caught
between
the
devil
and
the
deep
blue,
that
was
the
interest
that
congress
was
trying
to
protect.
that
was
its
policy.
of
course,
the
employers
may
have
a
preference,
but
congress
did
not
grant
in
section
10
(k)
or
8
(b)
(4),
protection
of
an
employer's
economic
interest.
congress
reserved
that
issue
to
the
normal
processes
of
collective
bargaining
and
we
submit
that
what
the
board
is
trying
to
do
here
is
establish
its
own
policy,
as
to
the
relative
economic
strengths
between
an
employer
and
a
union,
dealing
over
work
assignment
controversy,
but
we
submit
that
the
board
does
not
have
that
right
when
the
congress
has
laid
down
that
policy.
now
--
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
that
is
precisely
one
of
our
main
arguments
in
support
of
our
position
that
the
board
is
not
turning
out
its
duty,
simply
for
that
reason
that
the
board
cannot
force
the
employer
to
do
anything
and
this
employer
can
ignore
the
voluntary
procedure
that
the
two
unions
have
entered
into.
they
can
agree
to
the
joint
board
or
some
other
procedure.
the
employer
--
he
does
--
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
mr.
justice
white,
the
policy
or
the
rule
that
the
board
is
following
here
is
discouraging
unions.
it
is
discouraging
the
employers
from
joining
into
these
groups.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
under
the
board
safeway
doctrine,
yes
sir.
that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
because
of
the
policy
that
the
nlrb
is
following
that
we
are
trying
to
get
reversed
in
this
case.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
they
said
that
they
would
not
comply
because
the
employer
is
not
bound
and
that
we
know
that
if
the
employer
is
not
bound
the
nlrb
--
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
well
--
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
the
argument
runs
like
this.
we
will
comply
because
the
employer
is
not
bound.
we
know
that
if
the
employer
is
not
bound
to
the
voluntary
adjustment,
the
nlrb
will
hold
the
10
(k)
hearing.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
so
we
--
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
no,
but
we
have
a
second
bite
at
the
apple.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
absolutely!
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
only
as
a
result
--
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
that
is
right.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
no
sir.
we
believe
there
was
the
voluntary
adjustment,
when
they
agreed
to
the
joint
board
and
the
decision
was
issued.
they
are
only
refusing
to
comply
because
they
know
they
can
get
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
yes
sir,
but
i
think
it
goes
somewhat
in
the
circle.
if
the
board
was
not
following
the
policy
or
rule
which
is
an
issue
here,
there
would
simply
be
no
reason
for
the
tile
setters
not
to
comply
because
they
would
know
that
the
nlrb
--
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
not
if
they
lost
as
they
did
before
the
joint
board.
they
could
not,
that
is
the
point
i
am
making.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
because
the
nlrb
would
then
seek
an
injunction
against
them,
presuming
a
charge
is
filed
against
them.
there
would,
once
they
know
that
they
cannot
get
a
second
bite
at
the
apple
before
the
nlrb.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
striking
to
force
a
change
in
the
assignment
of
work
contrary
to
a
board
order.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
yes,
because
the
board
order
was
the
plasters.
now,
with
the
employer
--
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
the
nlrb.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
yes.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
yes,
they
are
bound
in
the
sense
that
if
they
strike.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
right!
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
yes
sir,
that
is
correct.
and
the
only
reason
they
are
refusing
to
be
bound
by
this
joint
board
is
that
they
know
they
can
get
a
second
bite
at
the
apple.
the
employer
refuses
to
be
bound
by
the
voluntary
mechanism
because
he
knows
that
he
can
wait
to
see
how
the
voluntary
adjustment
will
work
out.
if
his
preference
is
not
sustained
there,
then
he
knows
he
can
demand
a
10
(k)
hearing
before
the
nlrb
and
if
his
preferences
is
not
sustained
there,
he
can
completely
ignore
both
proceedings
and
goes
his
own
way.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
you
mean
the
abstention
provision?
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
now,
the
abstention
provision
comes
into
a
fact
if
(voice
overlap)
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
that
is
right.
then
the
board
will
hold
the
10
(k).
the
board
will
dismiss
the
charge
when
there
has
been
compliance
with
the
adjustment,
but
as
judge
leventhal
pointed
out,
the
stability
is
maintained
because
during
this
period
a
10
(l)
injunction
is
in
effect,
which
is
obtained
by
the
board
as
soon
as
the
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
charge
is
filed.
so
the
whole
scheme
of
the
statute
--
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
yes
sir.
that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
yes.
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
well,
both
unions
are
affiliates
to
the
building,
infrastructure
trades
--
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
yes.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
he
refuses
--
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
he
refuses
to
--
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
yes
sir,
it
is.
the
board
in
many
cases
has
held
that
the
joint
board
is
a
method
for
the
settling
of
disputes.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
it
would
be
affective
but
for
the
rule
of
the
board
in
this
case
mr.
chief
justice
because
then
there
would
simply
be
no
reason
for
a
union
not
to
comply
because
it
knew
it
was
not
going
to
get
a
second
bite
at
the
apple
with
the
nlrb
and
with
the
record
of
the
nlrb,
we
submit
that
the
losing
union
before
the
voluntary
procedure,
many
times
is
encouraged
to
seek
the
second
hearing,
before
the
nlrb
where
perhaps
the
employer's
for
reference
would
be
held
valid.
thank
you.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
board,
in
its
argument
arrived
to
conclusion,
mentioned
in
answer
to
a
question
that
23
years
of
nlrb
precedent,
which
is
involved
in
this
case.
it
is
certainly
true
that
this
decision
or
the
board’s
position
in
this
issue
has
been
followed
for
23
years.
however,
i
think
it
is
fair
to
state
that
there
is
more
reasoned
analysis
in
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
which
is
on
review
here
than
there
is
in
the
sum
total
of
every
case,
the
nlrb
has
decided
on
this
issue,
in
23
years.
the
nlrb
simply
has
refused
to
analyze
its
position,
the
legislative
history,
this
court's
decision
in
cbs,
simply
as
what
the
petitioner
states
in
his
brief,
couches
its
decisions
in
statutory
terms
always
denying
the
voluntary
adjustment
procedure,
any
credibility
when
the
two
unions
or
two
labor
groups
are
bound.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
i
think
mr.
chief
justice,
the
courts
have
allowed
the
board
wide
latitude
in
dealing
with
practicalities
but
i
think
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
policy,
a
policy
that
congress
set
down
in
section
10
(k)
and
therefore,
the
board
does
not
have
the
latitude
it
would,
if
it
was
simply
applying
a
mechanical
doctrine.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
no,
i
agree
with
that
statement
because
i
believe,
what
judge
leventhal
was
stating
there,
is
what
the
legislative
history
reflects
and
that
is,
that
this
section
of
the
act
and
as
this
court
has
said,
in
fact,
the
whole
dominant
theme
throughout
section
8(b),
8
(b)
(4)
is
to
protect
neutral
employers.
just
last
term,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
local
825
operating
engineers
case
at
400
u.s.,
this
court
again
reiterate
it,
what
it
said
in
national
woodwork
and
we
believe
it
was
actually,
affirming,
re-affirming
what
it
said
in
cbs.
the
protection
of
this
section
of
the
act
10
(k)
and
8
(b)
(4)
is
to
protect
an
employer's
neutral
interest.
now,
judge
leventhal
recognized,
and
we
certainly
have
conceded
in
our
brief
that
there
are
employers
who
have
preferences.
of
course,
there
are,
no
one
would
deny
that
and
judge
leventhal
recognized
it,
but
the
act,
this
particular
section
of
the
act,
for
these
two
sections
were
not
designed
to
protect
that
preference.
they
were
only
designed
to
protect
the
neutrality
of
that
employer,
when
he
is
caught
between
the
two
warring
unions.
now,
he
may
also
have
a
preference,
but
he
can
support
that
preference,
once
the
10
(k)
decision
is
decided
where
the
two
unions
agree
voluntarily,
then
one
union
goes
back
to
deal
with
the
employer
and
at
that
point
under
the
whole
structure
of
the
act,
his
economic
interest
can
be
protected
by
self
help
and
we
believe
that
is
exactly
what
judge
leventhal
was
saying
and
that
is
exactly
the
intent
of
the
whole
act.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
oh
yes,
justice
marshall,
the
plasters
were
working
there
for
a
plastering
contractor.
they
are
on
that
job,
in
fact
--
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
they
were
the
ones
who
put
the
scratch
coat
which
is
the
preliminary
coat
on
the
wall
at
to
which
the
tile
setters
came
and
put
their
float
coat
on.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
well,
now,
they
were
not
regular
employees
of
the
tile
setting
contractor,
they
were
regular
employees
of
the
plastering
contractor
who
also
had
a
--
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
yes,
who
also
had
a
sub
--
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
no
sir.
that
is
correct!
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
yes
sir,
he
has
--
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
he
has
the
interest
but
congress
set
--
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
no,
i
say,
the
congress
said
in
the
10
(k)
proceeding,
that
is
not
were
his
interest
was
going
to
be
protected.
his
interest
was
going
to
be
protected
after
the
two
unions
had
settled
between
themselves,
this
dispute
and
then,
one
union
would
go
back
and
deal
with
the
employer.
i
mean,
his
interest
is
being
protected
in
this
manner
just
as
if
his
tile
setters
employees
during
the
course
of
that
job
said
they
wanted
20
cents
an
hour
more.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
that
may
very
well
be
the
case,
yes,
but
that
is
not
the
interest
that
congress
should
be
protected.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
because
you
see
justice
marshall,
if
congress
had
wanted
to
give
him
that
sort
of
protection,
they
would
have
drafted
10
(k),
so
that
he
was
bound
by
the
decision.
as
it
stands
now,
under
section
10
(k),
the
employer
can
demand
a
board
hearing,
he
can
demand
a
board
hearing,
i
mean,
a
board
order
which
is
going
to
bind
the
unions,
but
which
then
the
employer
can
completely
ignore.
now,
we
think
if
congress
wanted
to
do
which
you
suggested,
they
would
have
said,
alright,
mr.
employer,
you
are
now
going
to
be
bound
by
this
10
(k)
award,
but
congress
was
not
about
to
adopt
any
form
of
compulsory
arbitration
binding
the
employer
and
the
unions
in
the
act.
now,
we
think
that
the
language
of
section
10
(k)
supports
our
position
very
clearly.
the
last
sentence
states,
and
we
have
quoted
it
in
our
brief
on
page
8,
and
our
brief
is
the
red
one,
“upon
compliance
by
the
parties
to
the
dispute
with
the
decision
of
the
board
or
upon
such
voluntary
adjustment
of
the
dispute
such
charge
shall
be
dismissed.”
well,
as
i
just
indicated,
the
employer
does
not
have
to
be
complying
with
the
decision
at
all.
if
the
two
unions
involved
comply
the
charge
is
going
to
be
dismissed,
the
employer
can
go
on
making
the
assignment
as
he
pleases.
now,
clearly,
if
the
employer
does
not
have
to
comply,
certainly
the
words
parties
to
the
dispute
in
that
last
sentence
cannot
include
the
employer.
the
first
sentence
also
uses
the
same
phrase,
parties
to
such
dispute.
now,
again,
if
in
the
last
sentence,
it
means
only
the
disputing
unions
are
labor
groups,
we
submit,
it
cannot
mean
anything
differently
in
the
first
sentence,
but
more
importantly,
the
first
sentence
with
regard
to
the
word
dispute,
states
and
we
have
this
quoted
at
page
10
of
our
brief,
“the
board
is
empowered
and
directed
to
hear
and
determine
the
dispute
out
of
which
such
unfair
labor
practice
shall
have
arisen.
now,
the
board
in
its
brief
and
argument,
has
said,
well,
the
dispute
there
means
the
jurisdictional
strike.
we
submit
the
dispute
cannot
mean
the
jurisdictional
strike.
that
the
jurisdictional
strike
is
the
unfair
labor
practice
and
if
you
made
a
substitution
of
terms
in
that
very
sentence,
it
would
read
that
the
board
is
empowered
and
directed
to
hear
and
determine
the
dispute
out
of
which
such
strike
arouse.
the
strike
is
the
unfair
labor
practice
and
i
think
a
short
analogy
would
be
in
a
discriminatory
discharge
case,
that
is
an
unfair
labor
practice.
the
discriminatory
discharge
itself
is
the
unfair
labor
practice.
the
unfair
labor
practice
does
not
arise
out
of
the
discriminatory
discharge
and
we
simply
cannot
understand
the
basis
of
the
board’s
argument
that
the
strike
equals
a
dispute.
and
we
also
believe
that
this
court,
in
cbs
answered
that
question
and
in
answering
that
question,
it
was
a
necessary
predicate
to
the
court's
decision
in
cbs
because
i
think
i
should
go
back
a
little
bit
prior
to
cbs,
to
recall
just
what
the
board
was
doing.
for
13
years,
the
board,
when
it
held
the
section
10
(k)
case,
was
simply
determining
the
validity
of
the
jurisdictional
strike.
the
board
would
state
in
its
decision,
whether
the
striking
union
was
entitled
to
the
work
because
of
an
outstanding
board
order,
certification
or
collective
bargaining
agreement.
if
it
was
not,
then
the
employer's
assignment
was
affirmed
every
time.
therefore,
the
board
was
equating
the
dispute
that
it
had
to
determine
with
the
validity
of
a
jurisdictional
strike.
when
the
case
came
to
this
court,
justice
black
writing
for
the
unanimous
court,
very
clearly
and
necessarily
determined
what
the
word
dispute
means
in
10
(k)
and
if
i
make
quote
him
and
this
is
at
the
bottom
of
page
14
of
our
brief,
“in
the
clause,
the
dispute
out
of
which
such
unfair
labor
practice
shall
have
arisen,
can
have
no
other
meaning
except
a
jurisdictional
dispute
under
section
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
which
is
a
dispute
between
two
or
more
groups
of
employees
over
which
is
entitled
to
do
certain
work
for
an
employer.
now,
we
submit
--
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
i
believe
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
way
that
it
is
written,
referring
specifically
to
the
clause
in
section
10
(k)
that
he
is
clearly
talking
about
the
use
of
the
term
in
10
(k).
now,
of
course
in
another
situation
not
involved
with
10
(k),
dispute
may
mean
something
else,
but
this
is
why
we
believe
that
this
question
as
to
what
dispute
means
in
10
(k)
has
been
settled
because
the
court
there
was
specifically
referring
to
10
(k).
with
regard
to
the
voluntary
adjustment
or
abstention
provision
of
10
(k),
this
court
in
cbs
also
made
reference
to
it
and
explained
that
the
court
--
the
board
in
the
case
before
the
court
then,
had
to
hold
a
10
(k)
hearing
because,
and
i
am
paraphrasing
the
court,
because
the
two
unions,
the
technicians
and
the
state
(inaudible)
were
not
able
to
settle
their
dispute.
the
court
stated,
and
again
this
is
quoted
on
page
14
of
our
brief,
“section
10
(k)
offers
strong
inducements
to
quarreling
unions
to
settle
their
differences
by
directing
dismissal
of
unfair
labor
practice
charges
upon
a
voluntary
adjustment
of
jurisdictional
disputes.”
the
court
of
appeals
here
recognized
that
once
it
had
determined,
what
dispute
is
covered
by
section
10
(k),
the
parties
to
the
dispute
for
the
purposes
of
the
abstention
provision
necessarily
means
the
two
disputing
labor
groups
are
labor
unions.
it
can
have
no
other
meaning.
now,
we
rely
of
course,
as
i
have
stated
on
cbs
and
we
submit
that
this
court
in
cbs,
relied
upon
the
legislative
history
of
this
act
and
the
thrust
of
the
act.
the
court,
went
into
the
legislative
history,
read
it
thoroughly
and
while
we
do
not
think
a
reanalysis
is
necessary
here,
i
think
briefly,
i
would
like
to
say
a
few
words
about
the
legislative
history.
the
house
bill,
that
was
introduced
in
1947,
did
not
contain
any
provision
similar
to
section
10
(k).
section
10
(k)
was
introduced
in
the
senate
by
senator
morse.
unfortunately
in
this
particular
situation,
we
have
a
very
clear
statement
as
to
where
the
idea
for
section
10
(k)
developed.
senator
morse
explained
in
the
legislative
history,
that
while
he
was
a
member
of
the
war
labor
board,
one
night,
a
very
serious
jurisdictional
dispute
occurred
between
two
unions
which
resulted
in
a
work
stoppage.
senator
morse
stated
that
the
war
labor
board
called
the
unions
together
and
they
told
him
to
get
the
men
back
to
work
or
if
they
did
not,
the
war
labor
board
was
going
to
appoint
an
arbitrator
to
settle
the
dispute.
now,
the
only
fair
reading
from
this
point
of
the
legislative
history
is
that
the
two
unions
got
together
and
settled
the
dispute
because
there
is
somewhat
of
a
gap
there.
senator
morse
simply
goes
on
to
say,
the
men
went
back
to
work,
but
i
think
the
only
fair
reading
is
that
they
got
together,
settled
dispute
then
they
went
back
to
work.
but
in
any
event,
senator
morse
then
goes
on
to
explain
that
he
decided,
the
war
labor
board
ought
to
have
a
policy
to
avoid
these
situations
in
the
future.
so,
he
proposed
a
resolution
which
became
that
policy,
which
said
to
the
two
unions
involved,
you
have
24
hours
to
settle
the
jurisdictional
dispute
without
economic
action
and
if
you
do
not,
we
are
going
to
appoint
an
arbitrator
to
settle
it
for
you
and
it
is
going
to
be
binding
on
you.
and
if
he
explained,
he
wanted
to
get
the
same
incentive
into
the
act
and
that
is
why
he
proposed
section
10
(k),
which
was
adopted,
almost
completely
the
way
he
proposed
it.
there
is
only
one
deletion
and
that
is
that
senator
morse
proposed
that
if
the
two
unions,
excuse
me,
if
the
parties
in
the
language
of
the
statute,
could
not
agree
upon
a
settlement
of
the
dispute,
the
board
could
hear
the
dispute
itself
or
the
board
could
appoint
an
arbitrator
to
hear
it.
the
provision
allowing
the
board
to
appoint
an
arbitrator
was
deleted.
it
was
deleted
without
comment
in
the
legislative,
in
the
conference,
but
we
submit
that
we
had
a
very
clear
statement
from
senator
morse
as
to
what
the
reason
for
section
10
(k)
was
being
put
into
the
act
or
being
proposed.
other
legislators,
senator
murray,
for
example,
also
echoed
his
hopes,
that
this
provision,
section
10
(k)
would
encourage
unions
to
set
up
machinery,
to
settle
jurisdictional
disputes
themselves
before
the
governmental
action
was
necessary.
in
affect
then,
congress
established
the
scheme
for
the
settlement
of
jurisdictional
disputes
which
resulted
in
work
stoppages,
which
we
think
is
clearly
discerned
from
the
statute
and
the
legislative
history.
it
has
got
four
steps.
first,
there
is
a
jurisdictional
dispute
between
two
unions
which
results
in
a
work
stoppage.
congress
said
that
work
stoppage
is
going
to
be
halted
by
a
10
(l)
injunction.
second
step;
congress
proposed
10
(k).
it
said
in
section
10
(k),
we
are
going
to
have
an
opportunity
for
the
two
unions
to
get
together
and
resolve
their
dispute,
the
abstention
provision.
step
three;
if
the
two
unions
or
labor
groups
cannot
resolve
their
dispute
themselves,
then
the
nlrb
is
going
to
have
to
make
a
binding
determination
of
that
dispute,
in
a
10
(k)
hearing.
step
number
four;
out
of
the
voluntary
mechanism
or
out
of
the
10
(k)
hearing
before
the
board,
one
union
will
prevail.
one
union
will
go
back
and
deal
with
the
employer,
will
negotiate.
each
will
be
able
to
use
their
own
economic
weapons
at
that
point.
congress
was
not
imposing
substantive
terms
on
either
the
unions
or
the
employers.
congress
recognizes
that
what
it
wanted
to
do
was
to
protect
the
neutral
employer,
the
employer
caught
in
the
middle.
the
helpless
victim,
between
the
two
warring
unions.
the
legislative
history
beginning
even
with
the
house
statements
and
the
house
report,
all
show
the
congress
was
concerned
about
the
neutral
employer,
the
innocent
victim
of
the
warring
unions,
the
helpless
victim
caught
between
these
two
unions
and
as
justice
black
said
in
cbs,
the
employer
who
is
caught
between
the
devil
and
the
deep
blue,
that
was
the
interest
that
congress
was
trying
to
protect.
that
was
its
policy.
of
course,
the
employers
may
have
a
preference,
but
congress
did
not
grant
in
section
10
(k)
or
8
(b)
(4),
protection
of
an
employer's
economic
interest.
congress
reserved
that
issue
to
the
normal
processes
of
collective
bargaining
and
we
submit
that
what
the
board
is
trying
to
do
here
is
establish
its
own
policy,
as
to
the
relative
economic
strengths
between
an
employer
and
a
union,
dealing
over
work
assignment
controversy,
but
we
submit
that
the
board
does
not
have
that
right
when
the
congress
has
laid
down
that
policy.
now
--
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
that
is
precisely
one
of
our
main
arguments
in
support
of
our
position
that
the
board
is
not
turning
out
its
duty,
simply
for
that
reason
that
the
board
cannot
force
the
employer
to
do
anything
and
this
employer
can
ignore
the
voluntary
procedure
that
the
two
unions
have
entered
into.
they
can
agree
to
the
joint
board
or
some
other
procedure.
the
employer
--
he
does
--
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
mr.
justice
white,
the
policy
or
the
rule
that
the
board
is
following
here
is
discouraging
unions.
it
is
discouraging
the
employers
from
joining
into
these
groups.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
under
the
board
safeway
doctrine,
yes
sir.
that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
because
of
the
policy
that
the
nlrb
is
following
that
we
are
trying
to
get
reversed
in
this
case.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
they
said
that
they
would
not
comply
because
the
employer
is
not
bound
and
that
we
know
that
if
the
employer
is
not
bound
the
nlrb
--
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
well
--
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
the
argument
runs
like
this.
we
will
comply
because
the
employer
is
not
bound.
we
know
that
if
the
employer
is
not
bound
to
the
voluntary
adjustment,
the
nlrb
will
hold
the
10
(k)
hearing.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
so
we
--
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
no,
but
we
have
a
second
bite
at
the
apple.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
absolutely!
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
only
as
a
result
--
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
that
is
right.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
no
sir.
we
believe
there
was
the
voluntary
adjustment,
when
they
agreed
to
the
joint
board
and
the
decision
was
issued.
they
are
only
refusing
to
comply
because
they
know
they
can
get
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
yes
sir,
but
i
think
it
goes
somewhat
in
the
circle.
if
the
board
was
not
following
the
policy
or
rule
which
is
an
issue
here,
there
would
simply
be
no
reason
for
the
tile
setters
not
to
comply
because
they
would
know
that
the
nlrb
--
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
not
if
they
lost
as
they
did
before
the
joint
board.
they
could
not,
that
is
the
point
i
am
making.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
because
the
nlrb
would
then
seek
an
injunction
against
them,
presuming
a
charge
is
filed
against
them.
there
would,
once
they
know
that
they
cannot
get
a
second
bite
at
the
apple
before
the
nlrb.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
striking
to
force
a
change
in
the
assignment
of
work
contrary
to
a
board
order.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
yes,
because
the
board
order
was
the
plasters.
now,
with
the
employer
--
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
the
nlrb.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
yes.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
yes,
they
are
bound
in
the
sense
that
if
they
strike.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
right!
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
yes
sir,
that
is
correct.
and
the
only
reason
they
are
refusing
to
be
bound
by
this
joint
board
is
that
they
know
they
can
get
a
second
bite
at
the
apple.
the
employer
refuses
to
be
bound
by
the
voluntary
mechanism
because
he
knows
that
he
can
wait
to
see
how
the
voluntary
adjustment
will
work
out.
if
his
preference
is
not
sustained
there,
then
he
knows
he
can
demand
a
10
(k)
hearing
before
the
nlrb
and
if
his
preferences
is
not
sustained
there,
he
can
completely
ignore
both
proceedings
and
goes
his
own
way.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
you
mean
the
abstention
provision?
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
now,
the
abstention
provision
comes
into
a
fact
if
(voice
overlap)
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
that
is
right.
then
the
board
will
hold
the
10
(k).
the
board
will
dismiss
the
charge
when
there
has
been
compliance
with
the
adjustment,
but
as
judge
leventhal
pointed
out,
the
stability
is
maintained
because
during
this
period
a
10
(l)
injunction
is
in
effect,
which
is
obtained
by
the
board
as
soon
as
the
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
charge
is
filed.
so
the
whole
scheme
of
the
statute
--
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
yes
sir.
that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
yes.
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
well,
both
unions
are
affiliates
to
the
building,
infrastructure
trades
--
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
yes.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
he
refuses
--
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
he
refuses
to
--
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
yes
sir,
it
is.
the
board
in
many
cases
has
held
that
the
joint
board
is
a
method
for
the
settling
of
disputes.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
it
would
be
affective
but
for
the
rule
of
the
board
in
this
case
mr.
chief
justice
because
then
there
would
simply
be
no
reason
for
a
union
not
to
comply
because
it
knew
it
was
not
going
to
get
a
second
bite
at
the
apple
with
the
nlrb
and
with
the
record
of
the
nlrb,
we
submit
that
the
losing
union
before
the
voluntary
procedure,
many
times
is
encouraged
to
seek
the
second
hearing,
before
the
nlrb
where
perhaps
the
employer's
for
reference
would
be
held
valid.
thank
you.
