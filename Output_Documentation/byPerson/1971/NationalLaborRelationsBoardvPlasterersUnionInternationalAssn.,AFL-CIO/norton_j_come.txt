mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
and
it
presents
a
question
involving
the
interpretation
of
the
jurisdictional
dispute
provisions
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
now,
section
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
which
is
set
out
at
page
3
of
governments
brief,
makes
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
a
labor
organization
to
strike
or
threaten
to
strike
an
employer
for
an
object
of
forcing
him
to
assign
work
to
employees
in
a
particular
order
labor
organization
or
on
a
particular
trade
craft
or
class
rather
into
employees
in
another
labor
organization
or
in
another
trade
craft
or
class.
now,
section
10
(k)
of
the
act
provides
that
whenever
it
is
charged
that
any
person
has
engaged
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
within
the
meaning
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(d),
the
board
instead
of
immediately
proceeding
in
the
regular
complaint
of
unfair
labor
practice
fashion
that
it
does
with
other
unfair
labor
practice
charges
hold
that
unfair
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
charge
in
abeyance
because
10
(k)
states
that
the
board
is
empowered
and
directed
to
hear
and
determine
to
dispute
out
of
which
such
unfair
labor
practice
shall
have
arisen
unless
parties
to
such
dispute,
submit
to
the
board,
satisfactory
evidence
that
they
have
adjusted
or
agreed
upon
methods
for
the
voluntary
adjustment
of
the
dispute.
now,
a
board
sense
10
(k)
was
added
to
the
act
in
1947.
as
interpreted
the
phrase,
“a
party
to
such
dispute
to
include
not
only
the
competing
unions,
but
also
the
employer
who
made
the
work
assignment.”
hence,
unless
all
three
parties
have
agreed
upon
methods
for
the
voluntary
adjustment
under
the
dispute,
the
board
itself
must
determine
the
dispute
under
section
10
(k).
the
court
below
via
a
divided
vote
held
that
the
parties
to
such
dispute
means
only
the
competing
unions
and
thus,
since
they
but
not
the
employers
were
bound
by
a
voluntary
method
of
the
adjustment.
the
board
had
no
power
to
re-determine
the
dispute
under
section
10
(k)
and
correctness
of
this
interpretation
is
the
issue
that
we
have
here.
now,
the
underlying
facts
are
briefly
these.
a
plasters’
union
picketed
two
different
jobs
in
furtherance
of
its
demand
that
the
work
of
applying
a
code
of
portland
cement
mortar
to
the
walls,
upon
which
tile
was
to
be
thereafter
installed
should
be
assigned
to
employees
represented
by
the
plasters
rather
than
to
those
represented
by
the
tile
setters
union.
the
first
job
involved,
in
addition
to
our
library
at
university
of
houston.
the
general
contractor
of
southwestern
had
sub-contracted
the,
a
tile
job
to
texas
state,
a
tile
contractor
employing
the
members
of
the
tile
setters
union
and
it
sub-contracted
the
job
of
installing
the
tile.
the
plasters
claimed
the
mortar
work
as
theirs
and
when
that
claim
was
rejected
by
texas
state,
the
sub-contractor,
they
submitted
the
dispute
to
the
national
joint
board
for
the
settlement
of
jurisdictional
disputes,
a
tribunal
to
establish
by
the
building
trades
department
of
the
afl-cio
and
certain
employer
groups.
both
unions
by
virtue
of
their
affiliation
with
internationals
who
are
members
of
the
building
trades
department
are
bound
by
decisions
of
the
joint
board.
but
neither
texas
state;
the
sub-contractor,
nor
the
association,
to
which
it
belonged,
had
agreed
to
be
bound
by
the
decisions
of
the
joint
board.
the
joint
board
awarded
the
disputed
work
to
the
plasters
finding
that
the
matter
was
governed
by
a
1917
agreement,
between
the
two
international
unions
and
a
1924
decision
interpreting
that
agreement.
parenthetically,
i
might
point
out
at
this
point
that
the
whole
dispute
arose
because
of
the
development
of
a
new
bonding
agents
that
were
not
discovered
until
1950,
but
nonetheless
the
joint
board
awarded
this
work
to
the
plasters
based
on
the
1917
agreement.
when
texas
state
refused
to
change
its
work
assignment
in
accordance
with
the
joint
board
award,
plasters
commenced
picketing
at
the
job
site
to
force
such
a
change.
southwestern
the
general
contractor
filed
charges
with
the
board
alleging
that
the
picketing
violated
section
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
for
the
act.
the
second
job
involved
the
re-modeling
of
the
rainbow
bakery.
there
martini,
a
tile
contractor
under
contract
with
the
tile
setters
union
was
assigned
the
job
of
a
installing
the
tiles.
the
plasters
are
claiming
the
work,
began
picketing.
again
martini
was
not
bound
by
the
procedures
of
the
joint
board
and
accordingly,
it
filed
unfair
labor
practice
charges
with
the
board.
the
board's
regional
director
finding
a
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
the
charges
had
merit
and
finding
that
neither
of
the
employers
here
at
texas
state
or
martini
were
bound
by
a
voluntary
method
of
adjustment
proceeded
to
a
10
(k)
hearing,
at
which
all
the
competing
unions
and
the
employers
involved
presented
argument
and
evidence.
it
was
a
seven-day
hearing
in
support
of
their
respective
positions.
the
board
on
a
basis
of
the
records
thus
developed
and
in
conformity
with
this
court’s
decision
in
cbs
which
directed
the
board
to
consider
all
relevant
factors
and
determining
the
jurisdictional
disputes,
so
the
board
considered
the
collective
bargaining
agreements
between
the
parties,
employer
area
and
industry
practice,
relevant
skills
and
efficiency
of
operation,
agreements
between
the
two
unions
and
the
joint
board
award
on
the
basis
of
--
after
considering
all
of
these
factors
and
the
evidence
adduced,
the
board
concluded
that
employees
represented
by
the
tile
setters
rather
than
those
represented
by
the
plasters
were
entitled
for
the
work
in
dispute.
in
short,
it
came
out
differently
than
the
joint
board
had,
which
had
awarded
the
work
to
the
plasters.
when
the
plasters
refused
to
comply
with
the
board's
determination
of
the
work
dispute,
the
board’s
general
counsel
at
that
point
issued
the
complaint
upon
the
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
charge
which
had
been
held
in
abeyance
in
the
expectation
that
the
section
10
(k)
determination
would
have
to
settled
the
matter.
it
did
not
and
under
the
scheme
of
the
statutes
you
pick
up
the
unfair
labor
practice
into
the
case
again,
complaint
issued,
it
went
to
the
board,
the
board
concluded
that
the
picketing
by
the
plasters
violated
section
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
and
it
issued
a
cease
and
desist
order,
requiring
the
plasters
to
cease
this
activity
and
to
post
appropriate
notices.
as
indicated
earlier,
the
court
below
refused
to
enforce
the
boards
order
on
the
ground
that
the
board
had
no
power
to
re-determine
the
dispute.
now,
as
i
indicated
at
the
outset,
the
abstention
clause
in
section
10
(k)
comes
into
play
when
the
parties
to
such
dispute,
submit
to
the
board,
satisfactory
evidence
that
they
have
adjusted
or
agreed
upon
methods
were
voluntary
adjustment
of
the
dispute.
now,
congress
did
not
define
who
the
parties
to
the
dispute
were
and
it
did
not
indicate
whether
dispute
means,
the
underlying
jurisdictional
dispute
or
it
means
the
dispute
and
the
jurisdictional
does
a
strike
which
has
emanated
from
the
dispute.
the
court
below
construed
the
term
such
dispute
to
mean
merely
the
basic
work
controversy
and
it
concluded
that
only
the
two
unions
were
parties
to
that
dispute
because
in
the
words
of
the
court
below,
the
employer
in
a
jurisdictional
dispute
is
a
neutral
caught
in
the
crossfire
between
the
disputing
unions,
and
unable
to
satisfy
either.
he
cares
not
how
the
dispute
is
decided,
but
once
merely
that
it
be
decided.
now,
we
submit
that
therein
lies
the
fundamental
error
in
the
court’s
reasoning,
namely
that
the
employer
is
necessarily
a
neutral
party
to
a
jurisdictional
dispute.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
am
quoting
from
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
justice
stewart
at
record
375.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
is
in
the
yellow
of
the
above
appendix,
375.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
court
was
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
it
purported
to
find
support
for
its
position
in
this
court's
opinion
in
cbs,
where
this
court
did
refer
to
a
jurisdictional
dispute
as
a
dispute
between
two
unions,
but
we
submit
that
no
one
would
quarrel
with
that
characterization
as
a
general
proposition.
the
issue
in
cbs
was
not
this
issue.
this
court
had
no
occasion
to
reach
it
because
in
cbs,
none
of
the
parties
were
bound
by
a
voluntary
method
of
adjustment.
the
only
question
was
conceding
that
the
board
had
power
under
section
10
(k),
did
it
properly
exercise
that
power
when
that
merely
rubber
stamped
the
employer's
work
assignment
and
did
not
undertake
to
consider
all
the
other
relevant
factors
like
in
the
(inaudible)
and
in
this
court
had
said
that
the
board
had
to
determine
the
dispute
in
the
conventional
way
that
an
arbitrator
would
by
considering
all
the
factors
and
the
board
certainly
complied
with
that
obligation
here.
now,
furthermore,
in
cbs,
you
had
a
somewhat
a
typical
situation
in
that
the
employer
there,
employed
both
groups
of
employees.
he
employed
state
unions
and
he
employed
the
technicians.
in
that
sense,
in
that
kind
of
a
situation,
perhaps
more
so
than
in
others,
he
is
relatively
indifferent
as
to
which
group
does
the
work.
it
is
not
the
typical
case
nor
is
in
the
situation
here.
in
the
typical
case
which
is
typified
by
the
situation
in
the
building
contraction
industry,
the
employer's
economic
interest
will
be
directly
affected
by
the
assignment
of
work
and
thus
in
no
meaningful
sense
and
he
said
to
be
a
neutral
or
indifferent
as
to
its
outcome.
indeed,
john
dunlap,
the
first
chairman
of
the
joint
board
has
stated
in
a
passage
that
we
quote
in
our
brief,
the
fact
that
some
unions
work
exclusively
as
a
matter
of
policy
or
custom
for
particular
contractors
factors
tends
to
convert
competition
among
contractors
also
into
jurisdictional
disputes
between
unions,
where
apparently
the
dispute
is
between
a
contractor
and
a
union
on
one
side
against
another
contractor
and
union
on
the
other
and
this
is
certainly
what
we
had
in
this
case.
indeed
in
recognition
of
the
employer's
interest,
the
national
joint
board
from
its
inception
has
included
the
employer
groups
in
its
structure
and
is
operated
under
the
explicit
principle
that
an
employer
is
not
bound
by
its
procedures
unless
he
has
specifically
so
agreed.
turning
to
the
facts
here,
neither
texas
state
nor
martini
has
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
the
plasters’
union,
and
both
had
one
with
the
tile
setters
union.
neither
employed
plasters
and
a
word
of
work
to
plasters,
would
have
required
this
contractors
either
to
hire
a
new
complement
of
employees
whom
they
believe
were
less
skillful
and
who
is
rates
were
higher
than
those
of
tile
setters
or
to
give
up
their
sub-contracts.
in
these
circumstances,
it
can
hardly
be
said
that
texas
state
or
a
martini
or
a
neutral
as
to
how
the
work
assignment
dispute
was
resolved.
now,
the
court
below
supported
its
reading
of
the
statute
by
relying
on
the
fact
that
the
employer
is
not
bound
by
a
section
10
(k)
determination
of
a
board,
although,
he
is
not
a
party.
now,
we
submit
in
the
first
place
that
this
fact
does
not
lessen
the
employer’s
direct
interest
in
the
resolution
of
dispute
and
relegate
him
to
the
status
of
a
neutral;
here
is
not
how
it
is
decided.
furthermore,
a
section
10
(k)
determination
in
favor
of
the
striking
union
is
enforcible
against
the
employer
in
the
sense
that
the
union
is
free
to
bring
strike
pressure
against
him
because
there
is
an
unless
clause
in
section
8
(b)
(4)
(d),
that
accepts
from
the
bond
of
8
(b)
(4)
(d),
a
situation
strike
where
the
employer
is
failing
to
conform
to
an
order
or
certification
of
the
board.
so
that
if
the
striking
union
prevails
in
a
10
(k)
determination
and
the
employer
does
not
comply
with
the
award
and
reassign
the
work
to
it,
it
is
free
to
bring
economic
pressure
on
the
employer.
so
that
in
a
very
real
sense
there
is
pressure
on
the
employer
here
to
comply
with
the
10
(k)
award.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
nobody
is
really
found
in
a
technical
sense
by
a
10
(k)
award
because
even
the
winning
union
does
not
get
the
work
in
the
sense
that
the
10
(k)
determination
requires
the
employer
to
change
his
assignment.
all
that
it
does
is
to
give
them
a
right
to
bring
economic
pressure
as
i
have
indicated.
now,
the
third
support
for
the
principle
support
for
the
court
below
decision
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
let
us
look
at
the
one
here
which
is
set
forth
on
the
page
54
of
the
appendix
and
the
board
says,
“para
layers
employed
by
texas
states
and
martini
tile
who
are
represented
by
the
tile
setters
are
entitled
to
perform
the

plasters
local
is
not
entitled

means
prescribed
by
section
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
to
force
a
require.”
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
the
board
--
the
general
counsel
and
the
board
have
so
interpreted
that
as
applying
to
a
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
to
a
10
(k)
order,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
a
10
(k)
order
does
not
run
to
a
particular
union
because
otherwise
you
get
into
trouble
with
the
8
(b)
(2)
and
8
(a)
(3),
your
honor.
it
goes
to
employees
of
the
craft
who
maybe
represented
by
the
particular
union.
it
does
not
run
to
the
particular
union
as
such
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes
sir.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes
sir.
mr.
norton
j.
come
they
were
parties
of
by
the
board.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
your
honor
because
the
nature
of
the
10
(k)
proceeding
is
that,
it
does
not
even
go
against
the
union.
all
it
does
is
to
make
a
declaration
of
who
is
entitled
to
the
work
and
who
is
not
entitled
to
strike
the
work.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
generally,
the
employer
has
been
the
charging
party.
he
does
not
have
to
be
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
a
charge
maybe
filed
by
any
person.
mr.
norton
j.
come
and
here
it
was
the
employer
and
i
would
say
all
90%
of
the
case,
it
is
the
employer.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
and
at
that
flows
from
the
general
provision
of
the
board's
rules
which
refers
that,
which
defines
party
as
a
generally
anyone
who
has
an
interest
in
the
proceeding.
so
that
the
board
has
from
the
beginning,
treated
the
employer
as
a
party
to
a
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
there
was,
your
honor,
in
the
sense
that
the
picketing
is
regarded
as
a
strike.
you
had
picketing
by
the
plasters
in
both
cases
to
change
the
--
to
get
to
work
and
that
would
be
deemed
a
strike.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
operative
part
of
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
says,
unfair
to
engage
or
induce
or
encourage
any
individual
to
engage
in
a
strike
or
refuse
on
the
course
of
this
employment,
the
working
line
any
goods
and
the
it
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
your
honor
because
i
think
that
in
the
labor
parlance
strike
and
picketing
are
pretty
synonymous.
now,
i
was
just
going
to
say
that
the
conclusion
that
the
court
below
found
a
support
for
its
position
in
the
legislative
history
of
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
and
10
(k).
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
since,
10
(k)
was
added
with
the
statute
in
1947.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
first
case
is
a
case
called
westinghouse
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
was
1949,
83
nlrb
477.
mr.
norton
j.
come
in
1949.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor,
we
have
listed
the
--
some
of
the
cases
in
footnote
6
at
page
15
of
our
brief.
the
court
below,
as
i
indicated
found
support
for
its
position
in
the
legislative
history
of
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
and
10
(k).
we
submit
that
its
reliance
is
misplaced
because
as
judge
mackinnon
pointed
out
in
his
dissent
in
the
court
below,
congress
really
did
not
focus
upon
this
particular
problem
in
the
legislative
history.
we
will
find
statements
in
the
legislative
history
describing
a
jurisdictional
dispute
as
a
dispute
between
two
unions
which
is
a
truism
that
nobody
would
seriously
quarrel
with.
they
have
their
origin
in
a
dispute
between
two
unions
or
between
two
employee
groups,
but
it
does
not
follow
that
the
employer
has
no
interest
certainly
where
as
must
be
the
case
before
the
board
can
get
into
the
act
he
has
been
implicated
by
a
strike
or
a
strike
threat.
secondly,
the
court
relies
on
the
fact
that
senator
morse
who
proposed
a
10
(k)
provision
which
as
he
proposed
that
gave
the
board
the
alternative
of
either
deciding
dispute
for
itself
or
appointing,
an
arbitrator,
which
was
taken
out
of
conference
indicated
that
he
felt
that
this
would
be
inducement
to
the
unions
as
it
was
in
the
war
labor
board
days
to
settle
the
jurisdictional
disputes
themselves,
as
you
had
hanging
over
them,
the
club
of
government
determination
of
the
dispute.
now,
we
submit
there
is
nothing
in
consistent
between
desire
to
have
the
two
unions
and
resolve
it
for
themselves
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
saying
that
if
they
are
not
able
to
resolve
it
by
themselves,
a
binding
of
final
determination
cannot
count
if
it
excludes
the
employer
which
is
the
problem
that
we
have
here.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
when
all
that
is
said
on
the
other
side,
we
come
back
to
what
in
our
view
is
really
the
simple
question
here,
namely
whether
or
not
in
view
of
the
vital
interest
that
the
employer
has
in
the
resolution
of
a
jurisdictional
dispute
plus
the
fact
that
congress
was
interested
in
having
these
disputes
settled
in
the
public
interest.
it
is
reasonable
to
assume
that
congress,
although,
it
was
perfectly
willing
to
encourage
the
unions
to
try
to
adjust
these
matters
short
of
economic
pressure,
intended
that
when
you
got
down
to
the
nitty-gritty
of
being
unable
to
resolve
the
matter
and
having
pulled
in
the
employer
through
economic
pressure,
congress
could
have
intended
that
there
would
be
a
binding
settlement
that
would
exclude
the
interest
of
the
employer.
after
all,
certainly
it
seems
rational
to
believe
that
if
there
is
going
to
be
a
final
and
binding
resolution,
it
is
going
to
be
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
it
is
binding
in
all
--
for
all
practical
purposes
because
the
employer
is
not
at
all
going
to
a
stand
up
under
the
economic
pressure
of
a
picket
line
or
a
strike.
there
is
a
weighty
compulsion
on
him
to
comply
with
the
award.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that,
that
is
an
open
question,
your
honor.
i
think
that
there
is
one
case
that
is
cited
where
they
tried
to
enforce
it
against
the
employer
and
the
court
refuse
to
do
it
on
the
ground
that
since
he
was
not
a
party,
it
could
not
be
enforce
against
him.
there
are
a
couple
of
cases
in
the
lower
courts
that
have
enforced
it
against
the
two
unions,
but
what
does
that
mean?
that
still
does
not
compel
the
employer
to
reassign
the
work
or
as
under
our
setup,
he
would
be
subjected
to
economic
pressure
or
a
–-
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
–
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
that
is
correct
your
honor,
but
–
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
is
the
basic
problem
and
i
think
that
you
do
not
get
an
answer
to
this
from
the
legislative
history
because
as
is
often
the
case,
the
problem
that
comes
up
is
one
that
was
not
directly
focused
on.
so
you
have
to
bring
up
there
we
believe
the
realities
of
the
situation
and
the
big
reality
here
is
the
employer's
economic
increase
in
the
matter
and
certainly
it
is
a
phone-book
rule
of
law,
if
you
do
not
make,
i
do
not
want
to
use
the
word
binding
because
this
is
not
binding
in
the
technical
sense,
but
you
do
not
make
a
substantial
decision,
that
it
is
going
to
affect
the
interest
of
a
party
at
least
in
the
way
that
the
employer's
interest
is
affected
here
by
being
subjected
to
the
picket
line.
how
did
at
least
letting
him
be
heard.
furthermore,
since
this
is
to
be
settled,
i
will
finish
it
in
a
moment
your
honor,
in
the
public
interest,
you
want
a
proceeding
that
is
going
to
ensure
that
it
will
bring
out
all
factors,
including
factors
of
economy
and
efficiency
of
operators
and
when
the
employer
(voice
overlap)
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
your
honor
but
as
i
say
one
of
the
tools
that
we
believe
has
to
be
brought
to
bear
here
is
the
economic
realities
of
the
situation
which
we
submit
congress
could
not
have
been
blind
to.
thank
you.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
and
that
is
even
if
you
interpret
dispute
as
the
court
below
interpreted,
it
is
not
central
to
our
argument
that
dispute
has
to
be
the
dispute
over
the
jurisdictional
strike.
we
think
that
--
because
even
if
it
is
only
the
dispute
over
the
work
assignment,
the
employer
is
a
party
to
that.
at
least
that
the
point
where
he
is
not
willing
to
go
along
which
he
certainly
was
not
willing
to
do
in
this
case.
mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
and
it
presents
a
question
involving
the
interpretation
of
the
jurisdictional
dispute
provisions
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
now,
section
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
which
is
set
out
at
page
3
of
governments
brief,
makes
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
a
labor
organization
to
strike
or
threaten
to
strike
an
employer
for
an
object
of
forcing
him
to
assign
work
to
employees
in
a
particular
order
labor
organization
or
on
a
particular
trade
craft
or
class
rather
into
employees
in
another
labor
organization
or
in
another
trade
craft
or
class.
now,
section
10
(k)
of
the
act
provides
that
whenever
it
is
charged
that
any
person
has
engaged
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
within
the
meaning
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(d),
the
board
instead
of
immediately
proceeding
in
the
regular
complaint
of
unfair
labor
practice
fashion
that
it
does
with
other
unfair
labor
practice
charges
hold
that
unfair
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
charge
in
abeyance
because
10
(k)
states
that
the
board
is
empowered
and
directed
to
hear
and
determine
to
dispute
out
of
which
such
unfair
labor
practice
shall
have
arisen
unless
parties
to
such
dispute,
submit
to
the
board,
satisfactory
evidence
that
they
have
adjusted
or
agreed
upon
methods
for
the
voluntary
adjustment
of
the
dispute.
now,
a
board
sense
10
(k)
was
added
to
the
act
in
1947.
as
interpreted
the
phrase,
“a
party
to
such
dispute
to
include
not
only
the
competing
unions,
but
also
the
employer
who
made
the
work
assignment.”
hence,
unless
all
three
parties
have
agreed
upon
methods
for
the
voluntary
adjustment
under
the
dispute,
the
board
itself
must
determine
the
dispute
under
section
10
(k).
the
court
below
via
a
divided
vote
held
that
the
parties
to
such
dispute
means
only
the
competing
unions
and
thus,
since
they
but
not
the
employers
were
bound
by
a
voluntary
method
of
the
adjustment.
the
board
had
no
power
to
re-determine
the
dispute
under
section
10
(k)
and
correctness
of
this
interpretation
is
the
issue
that
we
have
here.
now,
the
underlying
facts
are
briefly
these.
a
plasters’
union
picketed
two
different
jobs
in
furtherance
of
its
demand
that
the
work
of
applying
a
code
of
portland
cement
mortar
to
the
walls,
upon
which
tile
was
to
be
thereafter
installed
should
be
assigned
to
employees
represented
by
the
plasters
rather
than
to
those
represented
by
the
tile
setters
union.
the
first
job
involved,
in
addition
to
our
library
at
university
of
houston.
the
general
contractor
of
southwestern
had
sub-contracted
the,
a
tile
job
to
texas
state,
a
tile
contractor
employing
the
members
of
the
tile
setters
union
and
it
sub-contracted
the
job
of
installing
the
tile.
the
plasters
claimed
the
mortar
work
as
theirs
and
when
that
claim
was
rejected
by
texas
state,
the
sub-contractor,
they
submitted
the
dispute
to
the
national
joint
board
for
the
settlement
of
jurisdictional
disputes,
a
tribunal
to
establish
by
the
building
trades
department
of
the
afl-cio
and
certain
employer
groups.
both
unions
by
virtue
of
their
affiliation
with
internationals
who
are
members
of
the
building
trades
department
are
bound
by
decisions
of
the
joint
board.
but
neither
texas
state;
the
sub-contractor,
nor
the
association,
to
which
it
belonged,
had
agreed
to
be
bound
by
the
decisions
of
the
joint
board.
the
joint
board
awarded
the
disputed
work
to
the
plasters
finding
that
the
matter
was
governed
by
a
1917
agreement,
between
the
two
international
unions
and
a
1924
decision
interpreting
that
agreement.
parenthetically,
i
might
point
out
at
this
point
that
the
whole
dispute
arose
because
of
the
development
of
a
new
bonding
agents
that
were
not
discovered
until
1950,
but
nonetheless
the
joint
board
awarded
this
work
to
the
plasters
based
on
the
1917
agreement.
when
texas
state
refused
to
change
its
work
assignment
in
accordance
with
the
joint
board
award,
plasters
commenced
picketing
at
the
job
site
to
force
such
a
change.
southwestern
the
general
contractor
filed
charges
with
the
board
alleging
that
the
picketing
violated
section
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
for
the
act.
the
second
job
involved
the
re-modeling
of
the
rainbow
bakery.
there
martini,
a
tile
contractor
under
contract
with
the
tile
setters
union
was
assigned
the
job
of
a
installing
the
tiles.
the
plasters
are
claiming
the
work,
began
picketing.
again
martini
was
not
bound
by
the
procedures
of
the
joint
board
and
accordingly,
it
filed
unfair
labor
practice
charges
with
the
board.
the
board's
regional
director
finding
a
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
the
charges
had
merit
and
finding
that
neither
of
the
employers
here
at
texas
state
or
martini
were
bound
by
a
voluntary
method
of
adjustment
proceeded
to
a
10
(k)
hearing,
at
which
all
the
competing
unions
and
the
employers
involved
presented
argument
and
evidence.
it
was
a
seven-day
hearing
in
support
of
their
respective
positions.
the
board
on
a
basis
of
the
records
thus
developed
and
in
conformity
with
this
court’s
decision
in
cbs
which
directed
the
board
to
consider
all
relevant
factors
and
determining
the
jurisdictional
disputes,
so
the
board
considered
the
collective
bargaining
agreements
between
the
parties,
employer
area
and
industry
practice,
relevant
skills
and
efficiency
of
operation,
agreements
between
the
two
unions
and
the
joint
board
award
on
the
basis
of
--
after
considering
all
of
these
factors
and
the
evidence
adduced,
the
board
concluded
that
employees
represented
by
the
tile
setters
rather
than
those
represented
by
the
plasters
were
entitled
for
the
work
in
dispute.
in
short,
it
came
out
differently
than
the
joint
board
had,
which
had
awarded
the
work
to
the
plasters.
when
the
plasters
refused
to
comply
with
the
board's
determination
of
the
work
dispute,
the
board’s
general
counsel
at
that
point
issued
the
complaint
upon
the
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
charge
which
had
been
held
in
abeyance
in
the
expectation
that
the
section
10
(k)
determination
would
have
to
settled
the
matter.
it
did
not
and
under
the
scheme
of
the
statutes
you
pick
up
the
unfair
labor
practice
into
the
case
again,
complaint
issued,
it
went
to
the
board,
the
board
concluded
that
the
picketing
by
the
plasters
violated
section
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
and
it
issued
a
cease
and
desist
order,
requiring
the
plasters
to
cease
this
activity
and
to
post
appropriate
notices.
as
indicated
earlier,
the
court
below
refused
to
enforce
the
boards
order
on
the
ground
that
the
board
had
no
power
to
re-determine
the
dispute.
now,
as
i
indicated
at
the
outset,
the
abstention
clause
in
section
10
(k)
comes
into
play
when
the
parties
to
such
dispute,
submit
to
the
board,
satisfactory
evidence
that
they
have
adjusted
or
agreed
upon
methods
were
voluntary
adjustment
of
the
dispute.
now,
congress
did
not
define
who
the
parties
to
the
dispute
were
and
it
did
not
indicate
whether
dispute
means,
the
underlying
jurisdictional
dispute
or
it
means
the
dispute
and
the
jurisdictional
does
a
strike
which
has
emanated
from
the
dispute.
the
court
below
construed
the
term
such
dispute
to
mean
merely
the
basic
work
controversy
and
it
concluded
that
only
the
two
unions
were
parties
to
that
dispute
because
in
the
words
of
the
court
below,
the
employer
in
a
jurisdictional
dispute
is
a
neutral
caught
in
the
crossfire
between
the
disputing
unions,
and
unable
to
satisfy
either.
he
cares
not
how
the
dispute
is
decided,
but
once
merely
that
it
be
decided.
now,
we
submit
that
therein
lies
the
fundamental
error
in
the
court’s
reasoning,
namely
that
the
employer
is
necessarily
a
neutral
party
to
a
jurisdictional
dispute.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
am
quoting
from
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
justice
stewart
at
record
375.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
is
in
the
yellow
of
the
above
appendix,
375.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
court
was
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
it
purported
to
find
support
for
its
position
in
this
court's
opinion
in
cbs,
where
this
court
did
refer
to
a
jurisdictional
dispute
as
a
dispute
between
two
unions,
but
we
submit
that
no
one
would
quarrel
with
that
characterization
as
a
general
proposition.
the
issue
in
cbs
was
not
this
issue.
this
court
had
no
occasion
to
reach
it
because
in
cbs,
none
of
the
parties
were
bound
by
a
voluntary
method
of
adjustment.
the
only
question
was
conceding
that
the
board
had
power
under
section
10
(k),
did
it
properly
exercise
that
power
when
that
merely
rubber
stamped
the
employer's
work
assignment
and
did
not
undertake
to
consider
all
the
other
relevant
factors
like
in
the
(inaudible)
and
in
this
court
had
said
that
the
board
had
to
determine
the
dispute
in
the
conventional
way
that
an
arbitrator
would
by
considering
all
the
factors
and
the
board
certainly
complied
with
that
obligation
here.
now,
furthermore,
in
cbs,
you
had
a
somewhat
a
typical
situation
in
that
the
employer
there,
employed
both
groups
of
employees.
he
employed
state
unions
and
he
employed
the
technicians.
in
that
sense,
in
that
kind
of
a
situation,
perhaps
more
so
than
in
others,
he
is
relatively
indifferent
as
to
which
group
does
the
work.
it
is
not
the
typical
case
nor
is
in
the
situation
here.
in
the
typical
case
which
is
typified
by
the
situation
in
the
building
contraction
industry,
the
employer's
economic
interest
will
be
directly
affected
by
the
assignment
of
work
and
thus
in
no
meaningful
sense
and
he
said
to
be
a
neutral
or
indifferent
as
to
its
outcome.
indeed,
john
dunlap,
the
first
chairman
of
the
joint
board
has
stated
in
a
passage
that
we
quote
in
our
brief,
the
fact
that
some
unions
work
exclusively
as
a
matter
of
policy
or
custom
for
particular
contractors
factors
tends
to
convert
competition
among
contractors
also
into
jurisdictional
disputes
between
unions,
where
apparently
the
dispute
is
between
a
contractor
and
a
union
on
one
side
against
another
contractor
and
union
on
the
other
and
this
is
certainly
what
we
had
in
this
case.
indeed
in
recognition
of
the
employer's
interest,
the
national
joint
board
from
its
inception
has
included
the
employer
groups
in
its
structure
and
is
operated
under
the
explicit
principle
that
an
employer
is
not
bound
by
its
procedures
unless
he
has
specifically
so
agreed.
turning
to
the
facts
here,
neither
texas
state
nor
martini
has
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
the
plasters’
union,
and
both
had
one
with
the
tile
setters
union.
neither
employed
plasters
and
a
word
of
work
to
plasters,
would
have
required
this
contractors
either
to
hire
a
new
complement
of
employees
whom
they
believe
were
less
skillful
and
who
is
rates
were
higher
than
those
of
tile
setters
or
to
give
up
their
sub-contracts.
in
these
circumstances,
it
can
hardly
be
said
that
texas
state
or
a
martini
or
a
neutral
as
to
how
the
work
assignment
dispute
was
resolved.
now,
the
court
below
supported
its
reading
of
the
statute
by
relying
on
the
fact
that
the
employer
is
not
bound
by
a
section
10
(k)
determination
of
a
board,
although,
he
is
not
a
party.
now,
we
submit
in
the
first
place
that
this
fact
does
not
lessen
the
employer’s
direct
interest
in
the
resolution
of
dispute
and
relegate
him
to
the
status
of
a
neutral;
here
is
not
how
it
is
decided.
furthermore,
a
section
10
(k)
determination
in
favor
of
the
striking
union
is
enforcible
against
the
employer
in
the
sense
that
the
union
is
free
to
bring
strike
pressure
against
him
because
there
is
an
unless
clause
in
section
8
(b)
(4)
(d),
that
accepts
from
the
bond
of
8
(b)
(4)
(d),
a
situation
strike
where
the
employer
is
failing
to
conform
to
an
order
or
certification
of
the
board.
so
that
if
the
striking
union
prevails
in
a
10
(k)
determination
and
the
employer
does
not
comply
with
the
award
and
reassign
the
work
to
it,
it
is
free
to
bring
economic
pressure
on
the
employer.
so
that
in
a
very
real
sense
there
is
pressure
on
the
employer
here
to
comply
with
the
10
(k)
award.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
nobody
is
really
found
in
a
technical
sense
by
a
10
(k)
award
because
even
the
winning
union
does
not
get
the
work
in
the
sense
that
the
10
(k)
determination
requires
the
employer
to
change
his
assignment.
all
that
it
does
is
to
give
them
a
right
to
bring
economic
pressure
as
i
have
indicated.
now,
the
third
support
for
the
principle
support
for
the
court
below
decision
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
let
us
look
at
the
one
here
which
is
set
forth
on
the
page
54
of
the
appendix
and
the
board
says,
“para
layers
employed
by
texas
states
and
martini
tile
who
are
represented
by
the
tile
setters
are
entitled
to
perform
the
work
of
applying
the
coat
of
portland
cement.
plasters
local
is
not
entitled
by
means
prescribed
by
section
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
to
force
a
require.”
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
the
board
--
the
general
counsel
and
the
board
have
so
interpreted
that
as
applying
to
a
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
to
a
10
(k)
order,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
a
10
(k)
order
does
not
run
to
a
particular
union
because
otherwise
you
get
into
trouble
with
the
8
(b)
(2)
and
8
(a)
(3),
your
honor.
it
goes
to
employees
of
the
craft
who
maybe
represented
by
the
particular
union.
it
does
not
run
to
the
particular
union
as
such
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes
sir.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes
sir.
mr.
norton
j.
come
they
were
parties
of
by
the
board.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
your
honor
because
the
nature
of
the
10
(k)
proceeding
is
that,
it
does
not
even
go
against
the
union.
all
it
does
is
to
make
a
declaration
of
who
is
entitled
to
the
work
and
who
is
not
entitled
to
strike
the
work.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
generally,
the
employer
has
been
the
charging
party.
he
does
not
have
to
be
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
a
charge
maybe
filed
by
any
person.
mr.
norton
j.
come
and
here
it
was
the
employer
and
i
would
say
all
90%
of
the
case,
it
is
the
employer.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
and
at
that
flows
from
the
general
provision
of
the
board's
rules
which
refers
that,
which
defines
party
as
a
generally
anyone
who
has
an
interest
in
the
proceeding.
so
that
the
board
has
from
the
beginning,
treated
the
employer
as
a
party
to
a
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
there
was,
your
honor,
in
the
sense
that
the
picketing
is
regarded
as
a
strike.
you
had
picketing
by
the
plasters
in
both
cases
to
change
the
--
to
get
to
work
and
that
would
be
deemed
a
strike.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
operative
part
of
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
says,
unfair
to
engage
or
induce
or
encourage
any
individual
to
engage
in
a
strike
or
refuse
on
the
course
of
this
employment,
the
working
line
any
goods
and
the
it
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
your
honor
because
i
think
that
in
the
labor
parlance
strike
and
picketing
are
pretty
synonymous.
now,
i
was
just
going
to
say
that
the
conclusion
that
the
court
below
found
a
support
for
its
position
in
the
legislative
history
of
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
and
10
(k).
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
since,
10
(k)
was
added
with
the
statute
in
1947.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
first
case
is
a
case
called
westinghouse
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
was
1949,
83
nlrb
477.
mr.
norton
j.
come
in
1949.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor,
we
have
listed
the
--
some
of
the
cases
in
footnote
6
at
page
15
of
our
brief.
the
court
below,
as
i
indicated
found
support
for
its
position
in
the
legislative
history
of
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
and
10
(k).
we
submit
that
its
reliance
is
misplaced
because
as
judge
mackinnon
pointed
out
in
his
dissent
in
the
court
below,
congress
really
did
not
focus
upon
this
particular
problem
in
the
legislative
history.
we
will
find
statements
in
the
legislative
history
describing
a
jurisdictional
dispute
as
a
dispute
between
two
unions
which
is
a
truism
that
nobody
would
seriously
quarrel
with.
they
have
their
origin
in
a
dispute
between
two
unions
or
between
two
employee
groups,
but
it
does
not
follow
that
the
employer
has
no
interest
certainly
where
as
must
be
the
case
before
the
board
can
get
into
the
act
he
has
been
implicated
by
a
strike
or
a
strike
threat.
secondly,
the
court
relies
on
the
fact
that
senator
morse
who
proposed
a
10
(k)
provision
which
as
he
proposed
that
gave
the
board
the
alternative
of
either
deciding
dispute
for
itself
or
appointing,
an
arbitrator,
which
was
taken
out
of
conference
indicated
that
he
felt
that
this
would
be
inducement
to
the
unions
as
it
was
in
the
war
labor
board
days
to
settle
the
jurisdictional
disputes
themselves,
as
you
had
hanging
over
them,
the
club
of
government
determination
of
the
dispute.
now,
we
submit
there
is
nothing
in
consistent
between
desire
to
have
the
two
unions
and
resolve
it
for
themselves
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
saying
that
if
they
are
not
able
to
resolve
it
by
themselves,
a
binding
of
final
determination
cannot
count
if
it
excludes
the
employer
which
is
the
problem
that
we
have
here.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
when
all
that
is
said
on
the
other
side,
we
come
back
to
what
in
our
view
is
really
the
simple
question
here,
namely
whether
or
not
in
view
of
the
vital
interest
that
the
employer
has
in
the
resolution
of
a
jurisdictional
dispute
plus
the
fact
that
congress
was
interested
in
having
these
disputes
settled
in
the
public
interest.
it
is
reasonable
to
assume
that
congress,
although,
it
was
perfectly
willing
to
encourage
the
unions
to
try
to
adjust
these
matters
short
of
economic
pressure,
intended
that
when
you
got
down
to
the
nitty-gritty
of
being
unable
to
resolve
the
matter
and
having
pulled
in
the
employer
through
economic
pressure,
congress
could
have
intended
that
there
would
be
a
binding
settlement
that
would
exclude
the
interest
of
the
employer.
after
all,
certainly
it
seems
rational
to
believe
that
if
there
is
going
to
be
a
final
and
binding
resolution,
it
is
going
to
be
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
it
is
binding
in
all
--
for
all
practical
purposes
because
the
employer
is
not
at
all
going
to
a
stand
up
under
the
economic
pressure
of
a
picket
line
or
a
strike.
there
is
a
weighty
compulsion
on
him
to
comply
with
the
award.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that,
that
is
an
open
question,
your
honor.
i
think
that
there
is
one
case
that
is
cited
where
they
tried
to
enforce
it
against
the
employer
and
the
court
refuse
to
do
it
on
the
ground
that
since
he
was
not
a
party,
it
could
not
be
enforce
against
him.
there
are
a
couple
of
cases
in
the
lower
courts
that
have
enforced
it
against
the
two
unions,
but
what
does
that
mean?
that
still
does
not
compel
the
employer
to
reassign
the
work
or
as
under
our
setup,
he
would
be
subjected
to
economic
pressure
or
a
–-
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
–
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
that
is
correct
your
honor,
but
–
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
is
the
basic
problem
and
i
think
that
you
do
not
get
an
answer
to
this
from
the
legislative
history
because
as
is
often
the
case,
the
problem
that
comes
up
is
one
that
was
not
directly
focused
on.
so
you
have
to
bring
up
there
we
believe
the
realities
of
the
situation
and
the
big
reality
here
is
the
employer's
economic
increase
in
the
matter
and
certainly
it
is
a
phone-book
rule
of
law,
if
you
do
not
make,
i
do
not
want
to
use
the
word
binding
because
this
is
not
binding
in
the
technical
sense,
but
you
do
not
make
a
substantial
decision,
that
it
is
going
to
affect
the
interest
of
a
party
at
least
in
the
way
that
the
employer's
interest
is
affected
here
by
being
subjected
to
the
picket
line.
how
did
at
least
letting
him
be
heard.
furthermore,
since
this
is
to
be
settled,
i
will
finish
it
in
a
moment
your
honor,
in
the
public
interest,
you
want
a
proceeding
that
is
going
to
ensure
that
it
will
bring
out
all
factors,
including
factors
of
economy
and
efficiency
of
operators
and
when
the
employer
(voice
overlap)
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
your
honor
but
as
i
say
one
of
the
tools
that
we
believe
has
to
be
brought
to
bear
here
is
the
economic
realities
of
the
situation
which
we
submit
congress
could
not
have
been
blind
to.
thank
you.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
and
that
is
even
if
you
interpret
dispute
as
the
court
below
interpreted,
it
is
not
central
to
our
argument
that
dispute
has
to
be
the
dispute
over
the
jurisdictional
strike.
we
think
that
--
because
even
if
it
is
only
the
dispute
over
the
work
assignment,
the
employer
is
a
party
to
that.
at
least
that
the
point
where
he
is
not
willing
to
go
along
which
he
certainly
was
not
willing
to
do
in
this
case.
