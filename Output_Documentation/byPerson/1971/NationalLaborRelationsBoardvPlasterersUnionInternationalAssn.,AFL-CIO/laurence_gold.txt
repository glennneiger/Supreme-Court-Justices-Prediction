mr.
laurence

well,
there
are
times
of
mr.
justice
brennan,
when
an
advocate
is
upset
about
the
way
he
has
won
below.
he
is
been
brought
up
here
and
he
has
the
feeling
that
due
to
certain
deficiencies
in
the
opinion
below,
he
wants
to
gut
it,
but
i
want
to
make
it
most
emphatically
clear
that
we
are
not
in
that
position
at
this
time.
we
make
a
happy
exception
and
we
do
most
heavily
rely
on
the
opinion
below
which
shows
that
all
of
the
accepted
indicia
of

the
particular
provision,
the
overall
structure
of
the
act,
the
legislative
history
and
this
court’s
precedents
all
support
our
position.
mr.
laurence
gold
we
do
believe
so,
13
years
--
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
it
is
been
10
years.
last
time,
it
took
13.
last
time,
it
was
unanimous
opinion
of
this
court
which
overrules
was
13
years
of
administrative
action
which
the
board
claimed,
had
amalgamated
each
reading.
mr.
laurence
gold
cbs
sir.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
what
we
--
mr.
laurence
gold
as
we
read
the
statute
mr.
justice
white
and
the
language
is
on
page
3
of
the
board's
brief,
i
guess
that
is
what
we
have
all
been
referring
to.
mr.
laurence
gold
the
board
is
instructed
to
the
differ
when
it
receives
satisfactory
evidence
that
they,
the
parties
have
adjusted
or
agreed
upon
methods
for
voluntary
adjustment
of
the
dispute.
the
statute
does
not
really
say
that
they
are
has
to
be
adjustment
which
leads
to
a
disclaimer.
that
is
one
situation,
and
that
is
the
situation,
which
the
board
recognized
--
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
if
no,
they
have
not
repudiated
the
method.
they
have
said
that
in
life,
they
have
the
work
in
their
hands
and
they
say,
they
are
not
going
to
disclaim
and
leave
it
alone
if
this
--
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
i
do
not
think
so
because
it
maybe
repudiation
but
it
is
one
that
is
correctable
in
light
of
--
we
believe
in
light
of
section
301
which
applies
to
agreements
between
the
unions.
but
what
you
have
this
--
mr.
laurence
gold
yes,
i
believe,
so
it
is
an
arbitrary
award.
there
is
a
seventh
circuit
decision
involving
a
textile
work.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes,
there
are.
there
are.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes,
there
are,
there
are
decisions
holding
that
agreements
between
unions
to
submit
this
type
of
dispute
to
arbitration
or
an
enforceable
--
mr.
laurence
gold
well
there
are
--
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
it
would
be
but
then
you
have
problems
of
--
well,
it
would
be,
it
would
be
a
judicially
required
disclaimer,
but
what
you
have
is
as
long
as
the
board
continues
on
its
policy
of
not
recognizing
the
award,
you
have
a
practical
point.
the
unions
which
prevail
before
the
joint
board
is
barred
from
--
is
barred
unless
--
is
barred
from
using
economic
force.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes.
i
think
so;
the
party
that
prevailed
would
be
--
mr.
laurence
gold
that
is
correct.
they
would
be
the
only
one
with
an
interest.
mr.
laurence
gold
no.
because
he
would
not
be
a
party.
now,
there
are,
i
mean
there
are
situations
in
which
employers
are
a
part
of
a
mechanism
and
as
judge
leventhal
pointed
out
in
his
decision
where
that
happens
and
everybody
is
in
and
the
whole
matter
is
resolved
but
the
statute
in
10
(k)
is
only
designed
to
regulate
the
use
of
economic
force
in
situations
where
there
has
been
a
dispute
which
is
ripe
being
to
a
jurisdictional
strike.
at
that
point
under
section
10
(l),
the
board
comes
along
and
gets
some
injunction.
it
then
holds
a
10
(k)
hearing.
at
the
10
(k)
hearing,
it
determines
which
union
is
to
be
allowed
to
use
economic
force,
that
is
what
the
statute
does.
it
is
throwing
out
the
inter
union
dispute
in
that
as
mr.
capuano
put
it,
stating
which
party
will
come
back,
will
be
allowed
to
use
economic
force,
that
is
the
only
affect
and
that
is
why
we
think
the
government’s
argument
that
10
(k)
is
meant
to
settle
jurisdictional
strike
is
wrong.
it
is
not;
that
is
the
exactly
the
argument
that
was
made
in
cbs.
that
because
the
employer
is
not
affected
by
the
10
(k)
award,
they
have
to
give
the
work
to
the
union
that
the
employer
wants
to
give
it
to,
but
that
is
not
the
point
of
the
statute.
this
part
of
the
statute
as
all
the
other
parts
are
consistent
with
what
this
court
has
emphasized
from
insurance
agents
through
a
american
ship
and
most
recently
in
hk
port,
that
way
you
have
an
economic
issue,
the
parties
would
have
worked
that
out.
and
therefore,
congress
in
line
with
the
whole
scheme
with
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
as
you
point
out
mr.
justice
brennan
in
national
woodwork,
only
protects
employers
in
the
position
of
neutral.
we
are
not
arguing
here
that
the
employer
does
not
have
a
preference,
as
a
matter
of
fact;
this
is
not
a
fact
question.
we
recognize
that
employers
may
have
a
preference,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
but
the
only
thing
that
has
been
protected
is
their
interest
in
being
free
of
the
conflicting
claims
of
disputing
unions.
there
on
--
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
we
believe
as
i
said,
mr.
capuano
has
tried
to
spell
out
our
affirmative
arguments
and
as
i
say,
we
think
they
have
also
been
spelled
out
fully
by
the
court
below.
i
am
saying
that
we
believe
that
everyone
of
these
indicia
points
out,
points
to
the
fact
that
employers
in
the
positions
of
neutrals
that
the
interest
in
neutrality
or
the
interest
of
being
free
of
competing
claims,
is
the
only
one
protected
and
as
i
say,
we
rely
on
the
language
of
section
10
(k)
which
would
be
nonsensical
since
it
talks
about
compliance
with
the
award
if
parties
included
employer.
it
is
shown
by
the
whole
structure
of
10
(k)
which
only
deals
with
the
use
of
economic
force.
it
is
shown
by
the
whole
structure
of
the
act
which
says
that
except
when
an
employer
is
in
the
possession
of
a
neutral
economic
matters
between
the
--
and
union
had
to
be
settled
by
the
parties
through
economic
force.
and
it
is
shown
by
the
legislative
history,
which
is
indicated
at
page
16
of
our
brief
where
every
comment
made
was
indicated
that
congress
was
focusing
on
the
situation
of
an
employer
who
is
a
helpless
victim,
who
is
caught
between
unions
and
there
is
not
a
single
indication,
and
we
believe
you
would
need
the
strongest
indications
in
light
of
the
whole
structure
of
the
act.
there
is
not
a
single
indication,
that
this
was
a
provision
to
pull
the
economic
chestnuts
out
of
the
fire
of
an
employer
who
had
a
particular
preference.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes
sir.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes.
mr.
laurence
gold
no,
i
think
that
the
parties
have
to
--
mr.
laurence
gold
yes.
you
have
to
get
satisfactory
evidence
that
they
have
adjusted
or
agreed
upon
methods.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes.
i
think
somebody
would
have
to
make
a
claim
in
the
process
of
getting
a
decision.
mr.
laurence
gold
right,
because
at
that
point,
there
is
a
method
of
assuring
the
statute
provides
method.
again
as
judge
leventhal
points
out
that
the
statute
provides
a
method
of
assuring
that
the
employer
will
not
be
caught
between
those
two
unions.
the
losing
union
can
be
subjected
to
the
judicial,
can
be
brought
to
a
judicial
tribunal,
to
correct
it
is
--
it
is
the
error
of
its
way.
mr.
laurence
gold
right.
our
argument
is
very
simply,
is
that
when
the
board
--
mr.
laurence
gold
right.
we
were
saying
that
where
the
board
under
its
so
called
safeway
doctrine
dismisses
on
a
disclaimer,
it
is
giving
effect
to
the
language
that
the
parties
have
adjusted
and
we
are
saying
what
they
are
failing
to
do
here
--
mr.
laurence
gold
correct!
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
i
would
think
it
would
be
301,
but
i
would
point
out
that
the
board
plays
as
a
rule
and
they
admitted
in
footnote
21,
what
happens
is,
if
you
have
a
repudiating
union,
that
union
cannot
utilize
economic
force
because
the
board
treats
its
order
dismissing
the
proceeding
or
quashing
the
hearing
as
a
board
order
and
treats
the
loosing
union
as
if
it
is
lost
before
it,
and
if
that
losing
union
ever
tries
to
use
economic
force,
it
will
get
a
10
(l)
injunction
against
it.
mr.
laurence
gold
no.
they
would
go
and
that
would
be
in
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
charge
against
that
union,
the
losing
union.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
as
i
say,
the
board
takes
the
position
because
i
think
and
i
think
it
has
to
because
the
whole
purpose
of
the
statute
would
be
undermined
that
the
dismissal
is
the
equivalent
of
an
order
and
that
somebody
who
--
a
union
which
strikes
after
a
dismissal
on
the
ground
that
there
has
been
a
settlement,
is
striking
contrary
to
a
board
order
because
the
whole
purpose
as
senator
morse
explained
as
we
note
in
the
introductory
section
of
our
brief,
the
whole
problem
here
have
prior
to
10
(k)
was
it
they
were
meant
union
method
of
settlement
which
congress
wanted
to
encourage
but
which
did
not
work
where
the
--
where
a
union
had
a
great
deal
to
lose.
they
would
defy
the
tribunal
that
was
before
301
as
well,
since
it
was
in
1947.
mr.
laurence
gold
there
are
some
301
proceedings
pending
as
i,
as
--
mr.
laurence
gold
i
am
not
aware
that
any
has
come
to
decision.
i
would
point
out
as
i
indicated
that
on
the
--
in
the
brief
in
our
position,
the
case
of
textile
work,
united
textile
worker
versus
textile
union
of
america.
258
f.
2d
743
is
cited
and
that
is
the
case
holding
that
an
arbitration
to
decide
a
dispute
between
two
union
is
enforceable
under
301.
but
if
i
started
to,
and
just
the
conclude
the
thought
i
was
on,
the
whole
theory
of
the
statute
would
be
undermined
if
an
order
quashing
a
hearing
was
not
an
order
for
the
purposes
of
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
because
as
i
started
to
say,
you
had
unions
which
would
not
comply
because
it
hurt
too
much.
then
we
would
try
to
use
economic
force
and
the
whole
purpose
of
10
(k)
is
to
put
a
final
spur
into
a
--
is
to
give
an
impetus
to
compliance
by
taking
away
the
right
of
a
losing
union,
to
use
economic
force
and
once
that
is
taken
away,
that
union
is
in
–
mr.
laurence
gold
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
the
law
cited
on
footnote
21
of
the
board's
brief
and
i
just
--
i
would
just
note
again
in
conclusion
that
the
striking
thing
about
the
the
board's
presentation
is
that
it
makes
no
affirmative
arguments,
there
are
--
it
does
not
point
to
a
single
basis
in
the
statute.
every
argument
is
based
on
the
notion
that
the
employer
has
an
economic
interest
and
our
answer
to
that
is,
that
was
not
a
protected
interest
that
as
so
for
as
congress
was
concerned.
mr.
laurence
gold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
light
of
the
excellence
of
the

that
happens
and
everybody
is
in
and
the
whole
matter
is
resolved
but
the
statute
in
10
(k)
is
only
designed
to
regulate
the
use
of
economic
force
in
situations
where
there
has
been
a
dispute
which
is
ripe
being
to
a
jurisdictional
strike.
at
that
point
under
section
10
(l),
the
board
comes
along
and
gets
some
injunction.
it
then
holds
a
10
(k)
hearing.
at
the
10
(k)
hearing,
it
determines
which
union
is
to
be
allowed
to
use
economic
force,
that
is
what
the
statute
does.
it
is
throwing
out
the
inter
union
dispute
in
that
as
mr.
capuano
put
it,
stating
which
party
will
come
back,
will
be
allowed
to
use
economic
force,
that
is
the
only
affect
and
that
is
why
we
think
the
government’s
argument
that
10
(k)
is
meant
to
settle
jurisdictional
strike
is
wrong.
it
is
not;
that
is
the
exactly
the
argument
that
was
made
in
cbs.
that
because
the
employer
is
not
affected
by
the
10
(k)
award,
they
have
to
give
the
work
to
the
union
that
the
employer
wants
to
give
it
to,
but
that
is
not
the
point
of
the
statute.
this
part
of
the
statute
as
all
the
other
parts
are
consistent
with
what
this
court
has
emphasized
from
insurance
agents
through
a
american
ship
and
most
recently
in
hk
port,
that
way
you
have
an
economic
issue,
the
parties
would
have
worked
that
out.
and
therefore,
congress
in
line
with
the
whole
scheme
with
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
as
you
point
out
mr.
justice
brennan
in
national
woodwork,
only
protects
employers
in
the
position
of
neutral.
we
are
not
arguing
here
that
the
employer
does
not
have
a
preference,
as
a
matter
of
fact;
this
is
not
a
fact
question.
we
recognize
that
employers
may
have
a
preference,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
but
the
only
thing
that
has
been
protected
is
their
interest
in
being
free
of
the
conflicting
claims
of
disputing
unions.
there
on
--
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
we
believe
as
i
said,
mr.
capuano
has
tried
to
spell
out
our
affirmative
arguments
and
as
i
say,
we
think
they
have
also
been
spelled
out
fully
by
the
court
below.
i
am
saying
that
we
believe
that
everyone
of
these
indicia
points
out,
points
to
the
fact
that
employers
in
the
positions
of
neutrals
that
the
interest
in
neutrality
or
the
interest
of
being
free
of
competing
claims,
is
the
only
one
protected
and
as
i
say,
we
rely
on
the
language
of
section
10
(k)
which
would
be
nonsensical
since
it
talks
about
compliance
with
the
award
if
parties
included
employer.
it
is
shown
by
the
whole
structure
of
10
(k)
which
only
deals
with
the
use
of
economic
force.
it
is
shown
by
the
whole
structure
of
the
act
which
says
that
except
when
an
employer
is
in
the
possession
of
a
neutral
economic
matters
between
the
--
and
union
had
to
be
settled
by
the
parties
through
economic
force.
and
it
is
shown
by
the
legislative
history,
which
is
indicated
at
page
16
of
our
brief
where
every
comment
made
was
indicated
that
congress
was
focusing
on
the
situation
of
an
employer
who
is
a
helpless
victim,
who
is
caught
between
unions
and
there
is
not
a
single
indication,
and
we
believe
you
would
need
the
strongest
indications
in
light
of
the
whole
structure
of
the
act.
there
is
not
a
single
indication,
that
this
was
a
provision
to
pull
the
economic
chestnuts
out
of
the
fire
of
an
employer
who
had
a
particular
preference.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes
sir.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes.
mr.
laurence
gold
no,
i
think
that
the
parties
have
to
--
mr.
laurence
gold
yes.
you
have
to
get
satisfactory
evidence
that
they
have
adjusted
or
agreed
upon
methods.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes.
i
think
somebody
would
have
to
make
a
claim
in
the
process
of
getting
a
decision.
mr.
laurence
gold
right,
because
at
that
point,
there
is
a
method
of
assuring
the
statute
provides
method.
again
as
judge
leventhal
points
out
that
the
statute
provides
a
method
of
assuring
that
the
employer
will
not
be
caught
between
those
two
unions.
the
losing
union
can
be
subjected
to
the
judicial,
can
be
brought
to
a
judicial
tribunal,
to
correct
it
is
--
it
is
the
error
of
its
way.
mr.
laurence
gold
right.
our
argument
is
very
simply,
is
that
when
the
board
--
mr.
laurence
gold
right.
we
were
saying
that
where
the
board
under
its
so
called
safeway
doctrine
dismisses
on
a
disclaimer,
it
is
giving
effect
to
the
language
that
the
parties
have
adjusted
and
we
are
saying
what
they
are
failing
to
do
here
--
mr.
laurence
gold
correct!
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
i
would
think
it
would
be
301,
but
i
would
point
out
that
the
board
plays
as
a
rule
and
they
admitted
in
footnote
21,
what
happens
is,
if
you
have
a
repudiating
union,
that
union
cannot
utilize
economic
force
because
the
board
treats
its
order
dismissing
the
proceeding
or
quashing
the
hearing
as
a
board
order
and
treats
the
loosing
union
as
if
it
is
lost
before
it,
and
if
that
losing
union
ever
tries
to
use
economic
force,
it
will
get
a
10
(l)
injunction
against
it.
mr.
laurence
gold
no.
they
would
go
and
that
would
be
in
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
charge
against
that
union,
the
losing
union.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
as
i
say,
the
board
takes
the
position
because
i
think
and
i
think
it
has
to
because
the
whole
purpose
of
the
statute
would
be
undermined
that
the
dismissal
is
the
equivalent
of
an
order
and
that
somebody
who
--
a
union
which
strikes
after
a
dismissal
on
the
ground
that
there
has
been
a
settlement,
is
striking
contrary
to
a
board
order
because
the
whole
purpose
as
senator
morse
explained
as
we
note
in
the
introductory
section
of
our
brief,
the
whole
problem
here
have
prior
to
10
(k)
was
it
they
were
meant
union
method
of
settlement
which
congress
wanted
to
encourage
but
which
did
not
work
where
the
--
where
a
union
had
a
great
deal
to
lose.
they
would
defy
the
tribunal
that
was
before
301
as
well,
since
it
was
in
1947.
mr.
laurence
gold
there
are
some
301
proceedings
pending
as
i,
as
--
mr.
laurence
gold
i
am
not
aware
that
any
has
come
to
decision.
i
would
point
out
as
i
indicated
that
on
the
--
in
the
brief
in
our
position,
the
case
of
textile
work,
united
textile
worker
versus
textile
union
of
america.
258
f.
2d
743
is
cited
and
that
is
the
case
holding
that
an
arbitration
to
decide
a
dispute
between
two
union
is
enforceable
under
301.
but
if
i
started
to,
and
just
the
conclude
the
thought
i
was
on,
the
whole
theory
of
the
statute
would
be
undermined
if
an
order
quashing
a
hearing
was
not
an
order
for
the
purposes
of
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
because
as
i
started
to
say,
you
had
unions
which
would
not
comply
because
it
hurt
too
much.
then
we
would
try
to
use
economic
force
and
the
whole
purpose
of
10
(k)
is
to
put
a
final
spur
into
a
--
is
to
give
an
impetus
to
compliance
by
taking
away
the
right
of
a
losing
union,
to
use
economic
force
and
once
that
is
taken
away,
that
union
is
in
–
mr.
laurence
gold
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
the
law
cited
on
footnote
21
of
the
board's
brief
and
i
just
--
i
would
just
note
again
in
conclusion
that
the
striking
thing
about
the
the
board's
presentation
is
that
it
makes
no
affirmative
arguments,
there
are
--
it
does
not
point
to
a
single
basis
in
the
statute.
every
argument
is
based
on
the
notion
that
the
employer
has
an
economic
interest
and
our
answer
to
that
is,
that
was
not
a
protected
interest
that
as
so
for
as
congress
was
concerned.
