mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
few
minutes
that
i
have
here,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
two
points
of
statutory
language
which
i
think
are
relevant
to
the
support
for
the
determination
of
the
board
here.
as
mr.
come
indicated
in
his
argument,
the
real
question
here
in
terms
of
statutory
language
is
what
did
congress
mean
by
who
are
the
parties
to
the
dispute
which
the
unfair
legal
practice
arouse.
it
is
our
intention
that
this
dispute
must
have
arisen
out
of
the
union’s
disagreement
with
the
employer's
work
assignment,
not
just
the
union’s
disagreement
with
another
union
over
who
is
entitled
to
claim
this
work.
i
think
this
can
be
illustrated
by
the
facts
in
this
case,
in
the
appendix
on
pages
17
to
19,
as
factual
sequence
have
indicated.
the
factual
circumstance
was
that
the
respondent
union,
the
plasters'
representative
sought
and
demanded
the
work
in
dispute
here
in
a
series
of
meetings
over
several
months,
after
the
employer
had
indicated
that
he
would
assign
the
work
to
the
tile
setters.
the
tile
setters
were
the
employees
of
this
employer
who
were
members
of
the
tile
setter
union.
the
employer
had
no
contract
with
the
plasters.
there
was
no
picketing
over
this
several
months,
while
the
parties
discussed
this.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
that
is
right.
not
until
the
picketing
occurred
and
with
regard
to
the
question
--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
well
--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
i
think
the
question
is
why
does
a
picketing
start?
that
explains
who
dispute
is
really
with?
the
picketing
starts
because
the
employer
has
given
indication
to
the
union
or
the
union
has
some
reason
to
believe
that
the
dispute
or
that
the
employer
is
going
to
assign
the
work
in
question
to
the
other
union
and
that
--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
i
think
that
--
that
is
right?
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
if
there
is
no
active
picketing,
i
do
not
see
how
before
the
charge
is
filed.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
i
think
it
would
depend
upon
what
circumstances
that
the
picketing
ceases.
i
think
what
--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
i
think
that
the
--
if
the
unions
at
that
point
indicate
that
there
are
--
they
have
settled
the
dispute,
if
one
union
issues
indication
that
it
has
disclaimed
any
interest
in
the
work,
then
the
board
under
its
safe
way
doctrine
will
not
hold
the
10
(k)
--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
i
think
there
has
to
be
a
disclaimer
at
that
point.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
right,
if
that
--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
that
the
tile
setters
do
disclaim
--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
then
the
board
--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
then
the
board
dismisses
the
8
(b)
(4)
(d).
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
because
the
--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
well,
there
is
a
--
there
an
indication
to
the
statutorily
language
under
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
that
congress
intended
under
the
similar
circumstances
that
there
would
still
be
an
8
(b)
(4)
(d),
that
is
by
the
change
in
the
language
and
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
where
under
the
senate
bill
as
originally
passed,
the
senate
pass
language
that
said
the
dispute
over
the
work
assignment
has
to
be
between
the
two
unions
involved
and
conferences
was
changed
to
make
it
broader
than
the
two
unions
involved
but
also
the
none
union
employees
of
the
employer.
under
that
--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
that
was
--
it
really
means
this
--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
it
really
means
that
there
is
no
active
jurisdictional
dispute
because
--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
but
the
--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
there
really
is
--
the
employer
under
that
circumstance
has
option
of
assigning
to
someone
else.
he
is
not
forced
to
assign
it
to
the
picketing
union.
he
may
assign
to
his,
to
other,
his
own
employees.
but
the
absence
of
two
--
the
absence
of
a
claim
under
that
circumstance
means
no
8
(b)
(4)
(d).
what
would
happen
if
the
employer
does
not
want
the
plasters
to
do
the
work?
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
well,
i
think
not
because
i
think
what
happens
is
the
employer
assigned
to
work
to
whomever
he
wishes
at
that
time,
the
plasters
then
comes
back
again.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
that
is
right.
there
is
no
reason
to
file
an
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
at
that
stage.
there
is
a
--
there
is
no
dispute
--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
what?
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
but
if
the
tile
setters
do
not
want
the
work,
i
think
there
is
no
basis
under
which
congress
or
board
could
force
the
tile
setters
to
take
that
work.
it
is
the
employer's
option.
he
may
assign
it
to
another
group,
the
plasters
comes
back
and
pickets
at
that
time,
this
group
does
not
complain,
we
have
our
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
and
our
10
(k)
determination.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
there
is
a
power
to
--
can
move
to
the
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
also,
but
it
does
not
move
it
in
terms
of
the
employer
ultimately.
the
employer
can
still
assign
the
work
according
to
his
choice
and
we
then
go
back
to
the
same
proceeding
again.
but
the
--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
i
think
not.
i
think
this
is
with
regard
to
the
question
that
justice
brennan
asked
earlier.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
i
would,
could
agree
mr.
chief
justice
and
i
think
the
--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
if
they
are
employees
of
his,
i
think,
he
possibly
good
as
long
as
there
is
some
discriminatory
motive
or
anti-union
discriminatory
motive,
i
think
that
would
be
a
basis
under
which
he
could
discharge
employees
of
failing
to
carry
out
the
work
assignment
because
they
then
--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
i
agree
with
the
board's
safeway
doctrine,
but
i
do
not
think
it
is
entirely
controlling
in
the
circumstances
that
here.
i
think
the
language
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
shows
this
because
senator
kemp
in
the
conference
agreement,
he
explained
to
the
rest
of
the
senate,
rest
of
the
senate
that
the
intention
in
changing
the
language
of
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
was
to
permit
the
same
statutory
protection
where
an
employer
assigned
work
to
his
own
non-union
employees
as
when
there
was
a
two
union
dispute
over
the
work.
under
the
circumstance,
it
seems
quite
indicative
that
congress
meant
that,
that
would
be
a
dispute,
essentially
between
the
union
and
the
employer.
it
is
not
into
union’s
dispute,
so
there
are
not
two
quarreling
unions
under
that
circumstance.
the
congress
must
admit
under
that
circumstance
that
the
board
to
be
a
party
to
a
10
(k)
hearing
because
a
10
(k)
hearing
would
not
have
much
relevance
to
a
reasonable
determination.
if
only
the
one
union
was
there
presenting
their
position,
the
unrepresented
or
non-union
employees
had
ever
power
under
their
own
resources,
is
to
represent
themselves.
the
employer
would
be
the
party
there
in
the
10
(k)
hearing,
representing
the
work
assignment.
we
think
this
is
very
strong
indication
of
intent
on
the
part
of
congress
to
make
the
party
--
the
employer
party
to
the
dispute.
i
would
like
to
make
one
comment
with
regard
to
the
question
that
justice
brennan
was
asking
about
with
regard
to
the
board
not
binding
the
employer
in
the
10
(k)
award.
i
think
this
ties
in
entirely,
with
intra
scope
of
the
act,
whereby
congress
has
intentionally
kept
the
nlrb
and
the
government
out
of
the
substantive
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
i
think
this
is
further
indication
what
congress
did
in
10
(k)
that
they
could
have
given
the
board
authority
to
issue
a
10
(k)
order
which
would
have
bound
the
employer
and
the
union.
that
would
have
made
a
compulsory
arbitration
of
determination,
but
congress
decided
not
to
do
that
and
it
bound
neither
of
the
party.
all
it
did
was
restrict
what
circumstance
you
could
have
overlook
--
to
picket
over
this
and
this
ties
in
entirely
with
congress'
entire
approach
to
the
act
of
--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
that
is
right!
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
within
the
labor
board
in
--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
yes!
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
that
is
an
order
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
charge.
in
that
regard,
justice
white,
i
think
it
is
important
to
some
of
the
cases
that
are
cited
in
the
--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
through
the
joint
board
procedures.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
if
they
disclaim
the
work
and
the
work
is
assign
to
the
other
union,
you
said
the
losing
union,
under
a
10
(k)?
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
well,
the
union
who
a
did
not
get
the
work
under
that
circumstance,
if
he
does
not
adhere
to
their
settlement
for
reasons
of
his
own,
then
has
the
opportunity
if
the
case
does
go
to
the
nlrb
of
having
the
board
decide
that
he
is
entitled
to
the
work.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
it
has
not
been
ultimately
settled,
right
there.
i
think
that
is
more
a
problem
of
a
voluntary
settlement
procedure,
having
provisions
for
enforcement
of
their
decisions,
among
those
parties.
it
does
not
really
relate
to
the
board.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
i
am
sorry.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
yes,
i
am
sorry
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
thought
i
had
done,
that
i
have
no
quarrel
with
the
safeway
decision,
at
all.
i
think
it
is
in
the
absence
of
active
claims
for
the
work.
the
board
does
not
proceed
on
an
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
or
10
(k)
charge.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
the
practical
result
was
that
the
tile
setters,
who
were
the
employers
represented
by
the
tile
setters
did
the
work.
they
were
the
employees
of
the
contractor,
and
they
received
the
assignment
of
the
nlrb.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
there
was
not
a
binding
settlement
between
the
two
unions.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
the
joint
board
issued
its
determination,
but
one
of
the
unions
did
not
follow
the
joint
board
determination.
my
time
is
expired.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
few
minutes
that
i
have
here,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
two
points
of
statutory
language
which
i
think
are
relevant
to
the
support
for
the
determination
of
the
board
here.
as
mr.
come
indicated
in
his
argument,
the
real
question
here
in
terms
of
statutory
language
is
what
did
congress
mean
by
who
are
the
parties
to
the
dispute
which
the
unfair
legal
practice
arouse.
it
is
our
intention
that
this
dispute
must
have
arisen
out
of
the
union’s
disagreement
with
the
employer's
work
assignment,
not
just
the
union’s
disagreement
with
another
union
over
who
is
entitled
to
claim
this
work.
i
think
this
can
be
illustrated
by
the
facts
in
this
case,
in
the
appendix
on
pages
17
to
19,
as
factual
sequence
have
indicated.
the
factual
circumstance
was
that
the
respondent
union,
the
plasters'
representative
sought
and
demanded
the
work
in
dispute
here
in
a
series
of
meetings
over
several
months,
after
the
employer
had
indicated
that
he
would
assign
the
work
to
the
tile
setters.
the
tile
setters
were
the
employees
of
this
employer
who
were
members
of
the
tile
setter
union.
the
employer
had
no
contract
with
the
plasters.
there
was
no
picketing
over
this
several
months,
while
the
parties
discussed
this.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
that
is
right.
not
until
the
picketing
occurred
and
with
regard
to
the
question
--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
well
--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
i
think
the
question
is
why
does
a
picketing
start?
that
explains
who
dispute
is
really
with?
the
picketing
starts
because
the
employer
has
given
indication
to
the
union
or
the
union
has
some
reason
to
believe
that
the
dispute
or
that
the
employer
is
going
to
assign
the
work
in
question
to
the
other
union
and
that
--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
i
think
that
--
that
is
right?
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
if
there
is
no
active
picketing,
i
do
not
see
how
before
the
charge
is
filed.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
i
think
it
would
depend
upon
what
circumstances
that
the
picketing
ceases.
i
think
what
--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
i
think
that
the
--
if
the
unions
at
that
point
indicate
that
there
are
--
they
have
settled
the
dispute,
if
one
union
issues
indication
that
it
has
disclaimed
any
interest
in
the
work,
then
the
board
under
its
safe
way
doctrine
will
not
hold
the
10
(k)
--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
i
think
there
has
to
be
a
disclaimer
at
that
point.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
right,
if
that
--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
that
the
tile
setters
do
disclaim
--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
then
the
board
--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
then
the
board
dismisses
the
8
(b)
(4)
(d).
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
because
the
--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
well,
there
is
a
--
there
an
indication
to
the
statutorily
language
under
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
that
congress
intended
under
the
similar

that

also
the

under
that
--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
that
was
--
it
really
means
this
--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
it
really
means
that
there
is
no
active
jurisdictional
dispute
because
--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
but
the
--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
there
really
is
--
the
employer
under
that
circumstance
has
option
of
assigning
to
someone
else.
he
is
not
forced
to
assign
it
to
the
picketing
union.
he
may
assign
to
his,
to
other,
his
own
employees.
but
the
absence
of
two
--
the
absence
of
a
claim
under
that
circumstance
means
no
8
(b)
(4)
(d).
what
would
happen
if
the
employer
does
not
want
the
plasters
to
do
the
work?
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
well,
i
think
not
because
i
think
what
happens
is
the
employer
assigned
to
work
to
whomever
he
wishes
at
that
time,
the
plasters
then
comes
back
again.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
that
is
right.
there
is
no
reason
to
file
an
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
at
that
stage.
there
is
a
--
there
is
no
dispute
--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
what?
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
but
if
the
tile
setters
do
not
want
the
work,
i
think
there
is
no
basis
under
which
congress
or
board
could
force
the
tile
setters
to
take
that
work.
it
is
the
employer's
option.
he
may
assign
it
to
another
group,
the
plasters
comes
back
and
pickets
at
that
time,
this
group
does
not
complain,
we
have
our
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
and
our
10
(k)
determination.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
there
is
a
power
to
--
can
move
to
the
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
also,
but
it
does
not
move
it
in
terms
of
the
employer
ultimately.
the
employer
can
still
assign
the
work
according
to
his
choice
and
we
then
go
back
to
the
same
proceeding
again.
but
the
--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
i
think
not.
i
think
this
is
with
regard
to
the
question
that
justice
brennan
asked
earlier.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
i
would,
could
agree
mr.
chief
justice
and
i
think
the
--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
if
they
are
employees
of
his,
i
think,
he
possibly
good
as
long
as
there
is
some
discriminatory
motive
or
anti-union
discriminatory
motive,
i
think
that
would
be
a
basis
under
which
he
could
discharge
employees
of
failing
to
carry
out
the
work
assignment
because
they
then
--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
i
agree
with
the
board's
safeway
doctrine,
but
i
do
not
think
it
is
entirely
controlling
in
the
circumstances
that
here.
i
think
the
language
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
shows
this
because
senator
kemp
in
the
conference
agreement,
he
explained
to
the
rest
of
the
senate,
rest
of
the
senate
that
the
intention
in
changing
the
language
of
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
was
to
permit
the
same
statutory
protection
where
an
employer
assigned
work
to
his
own
non-union
employees
as
when
there
was
a
two
union
dispute
over
the
work.
under
the
circumstance,
it
seems
quite
indicative
that
congress
meant
that,
that
would
be
a
dispute,
essentially
between
the
union
and
the
employer.
it
is
not
into
union’s
dispute,
so
there
are
not
two
quarreling
unions
under
that
circumstance.
the
congress
must
admit
under
that
circumstance
that
the
board
to
be
a
party
to
a
10
(k)
hearing
because
a
10
(k)
hearing
would
not
have
much
relevance
to
a
reasonable
determination.
if
only
the
one
union
was
there
presenting
their
position,
the
unrepresented
or
non-union
employees
had
ever
power
under
their
own
resources,
is
to
represent
themselves.
the
employer
would
be
the
party
there
in
the
10
(k)
hearing,
representing
the
work
assignment.
we
think
this
is
very
strong
indication
of
intent
on
the
part
of
congress
to
make
the
party
--
the
employer
party
to
the
dispute.
i
would
like
to
make
one
comment
with
regard
to
the
question
that
justice
brennan
was
asking
about
with
regard
to
the
board
not
binding
the
employer
in
the
10
(k)
award.
i
think
this
ties
in
entirely,
with
intra
scope
of
the
act,
whereby
congress
has
intentionally
kept
the
nlrb
and
the
government
out
of
the
substantive
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
i
think
this
is
further
indication
what
congress
did
in
10
(k)
that
they
could
have
given
the
board
authority
to
issue
a
10
(k)
order
which
would
have
bound
the
employer
and
the
union.
that
would
have
made
a
compulsory
arbitration
of
determination,
but
congress
decided
not
to
do
that
and
it
bound
neither
of
the
party.
all
it
did
was
restrict
what
circumstance
you
could
have
overlook
--
to
picket
over
this
and
this
ties
in
entirely
with
congress'
entire
approach
to
the
act
of
--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
that
is
right!
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
within
the
labor
board
in
--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
yes!
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
that
is
an
order
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
charge.
in
that
regard,
justice
white,
i
think
it
is
important
to
some
of
the
cases
that
are
cited
in
the
--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
through
the
joint
board
procedures.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
if
they
disclaim
the
work
and
the
work
is
assign
to
the
other
union,
you
said
the
losing
union,
under
a
10
(k)?
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
well,
the
union
who
a
did
not
get
the
work
under
that
circumstance,
if
he
does
not
adhere
to
their
settlement
for
reasons
of
his
own,
then
has
the
opportunity
if
the
case
does
go
to
the
nlrb
of
having
the
board
decide
that
he
is
entitled
to
the
work.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
it
has
not
been
ultimately
settled,
right
there.
i
think
that
is
more
a
problem
of
a
voluntary
settlement
procedure,
having
provisions
for
enforcement
of
their
decisions,
among
those
parties.
it
does
not
really
relate
to
the
board.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
i
am
sorry.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
yes,
i
am
sorry
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
thought
i
had
done,
that
i
have
no
quarrel
with
the
safeway
decision,
at
all.
i
think
it
is
in
the
absence
of
active
claims
for
the
work.
the
board
does
not
proceed
on
an
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
or
10
(k)
charge.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
the
practical
result
was
that
the
tile
setters,
who
were
the
employers
represented
by
the
tile
setters
did
the
work.
they
were
the
employees
of
the
contractor,
and
they
received
the
assignment
of
the
nlrb.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
there
was
not
a
binding
settlement
between
the
two
unions.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
the
joint
board
issued
its
determination,
but
one
of
the
unions
did
not
follow
the
joint
board
determination.
my
time
is
expired.
