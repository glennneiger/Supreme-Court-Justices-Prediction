justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
gather
even
if
the
employer
was
not
to
charge
the
party,
the
employer
is
made
a
party
by
force?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
is
not
but
no
case
is
the
order
(inaudible)
from
the
one
that
presented
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
specifically,
that
is
under
the
employees
of
the
employers
and
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
do
not
know
(inaudible)
whatever
maybe
the
case
it
was
settled
i
do
not
know
what
we
have
here
--
what
we
have
here
is
whether
the
board
(inaudible)
proceeding,
and
facts
of
this
case
so
whether
the
extension
clause.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
it
is
forward
for
to
move
it
that
only
has.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
they
are
not
bound
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright,
but
what
is
important?
well,
i
have
been
caught
on
the
standard,
i
gather
your
argument
is
agreed
upon
methods
of
the
voluntary
adjustment.
certainly
they
have
agreed
upon
a
method.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
disputes
have
been
submitted
to
the
joint
board
and
just
decide
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
the
looser
refused
to
be
bound.
is
that
what
that
means
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
satisfying?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
are
the
reason
he
does?
is
this
provision
satisfied
merely
because
they
have
agreed
upon
a
method?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
is
always
easy
to
say
that
as
it
was.[laughter]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
thought
you
would
not
feel
better
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
which
overrides
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
the
fact
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
the
joint
board
determination
pursuant
to
the
agreement
to
submit
to
the
joint
board
would
be
enforceable
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
is
that
(inaudible)
an
agreement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me,
if
the
union
has
prevailed
may
result
to
be
awarded.
it
is
the
only
part
of
the
agreement
which
result
to
the
award.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
this
instance,
only
the
plasters
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
the
employer
could.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
gold,
i
gather
your
whole
argument
really
comes
down
before
(inaudible)
that
in
this
case,
there
was
a
method
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
that
is
if
there
exists
an
agreed
upon
method
that
in
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
whether
or
not
the
method
is
in
fact
employed,
both
setup
should
employed
it
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
at
least
have
to
employ,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
had
agreed
upon
method,
but
it
must
be
at
least
employed
by
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
do
you
stop
should,
that
is
as
far
as
(inaudible).
that
is
resorted
to
the
joint
board
decide
it
and
the
losing
unions
repudiates
the
agreement
and
you
say
that
is
immaterial,
nevertheless,
as
far
as
the
statute
is
concerned,
the
board
has
no
jurisdiction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
you
wind
up
by
saying
that
it
is
not
to
the
board
that
would
assist
order
to
bring
the
repudiating
union
in
line.
it
is
either
as
some
other
method
that
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
under
301
or
i
take
it
a
state
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
will
have
to
be
a
new
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
arbitrary?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
had
there
ever
been
a
301
proceeding
on
board's
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
everyone
and
anyone
come
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
agree
mr.
come,
was
the
joint
board
award
since
it
goes
vested
on
principle
on
the
filling?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
the
court
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
does
say
that
the
(inaudible).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
intended
but
they
also
thought
of
remedies,
i
suppose?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
could
not
agree
with
you
more,
but
the
congress
legislated
otherwise,
i
suppose
that
the
congress
could
put
it
in
order?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
gather
even
if
the
employer

the

is
