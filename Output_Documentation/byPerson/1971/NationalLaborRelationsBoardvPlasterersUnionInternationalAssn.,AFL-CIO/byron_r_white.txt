what
does
a
10

order
say
by
the
way?
i
mean,
what
does
a
typical

say?
it
is
phrase
in
terms
of
designating
the
bargain

for
the

justice

was
that
the
kind
of
an

that
the

about?
it
talks
about
an
order
determining
the

performing

is
that
a
10

order?
justice
byron

white
to
a
10

order?
justice

because
they
are
really
saying
that
here

some
work

and
the
bargaining

for
that

is
a

is
that
what
a

says?
justice

there
is
nobody
in
this
case
disputes
that,
that
unless
clause
indeed
refers
to
a
10

--
justice

white
is
it
the
employer
that
starts
the

he
has
to
file
a
complaint
before
10

is

does
he
not?
justice

(inaudible)
justice

here
it
was
the

(inaudible)
to
no
unfair

complaint
to
be
filed
and
no
10

could
be

justice

let
us
assume
the
picketing
does
occur
--
justice
byron

white
and
the
--
justice
byron

white
but
if
before
the
employer
gets
to
the
board
with
a
complaint,
the
picketing
ceases
although
the
dispute
has
not
ceased,
there
can
be
no
10

proceeding?
justice
byron

white
let
us
assume
there
is
picketing
and
a
complaint
is
filed
and
a
10
(k)
procedure
is
starting
and
then
picketing
then
it
ceases?
justice

now,
the
parties
say
that
there
is
no
unfair
labor
practice
is
going
on
and
it
cannot
be
any
10

procedure
and
the

say
that?
justice

so
that
--
even
though
the
employer
object.
let
us
assume
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
one
union
disclaims
it
but
the
employer
says,
i
am
sorry.
the
disclaiming
union
is
the
union;
i
want
to
do
the
work.
justice
byron

let
us
assume
the
tile
setters
in
this
case
have
disclaimed.
justice
byron

and
the
employer
says
i
do
not
want
the

justice
byron

white
i
want
the
tile
setters
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
how
could
it
mean
that
the
party
says
that?
justice
byron

white
includes
the
employer?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
if
one
union
disclaims
it,
what
that
really
means
is
that
it
is
refusing
to
do
the
work?
justice
byron

white
so
why
would
the
board
ever
dismiss
it?
justice
byron

white
well,
there
is.
the
employer
wants
the
tile
setters
to
do
and
the
tile
setters
refuse
to
do
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
you
--
why
do
you
think
it
does?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
that
is
the
relevant
in
how
you
define
parties
that
under
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
it
is
just
a
question
of
the
way
the
union,
how
the
procedure
then
for
the
union.
i
mean,
instead
of
coming
up
on
these
facts,
the
unions
can
always
abort
the
10
(k)
by
one
disclaiming
it,
they
really
settled
the
dispute.
all
they
have
to
do
is
that
one
more
step
to
their
settlement.
namely
a
disclaim.
in
this
case
it
has
no
importance
as
else
where.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
filed,
it
is
been
filed
and
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
employer
says
the
dispute
is
not
settled.
i
do
not
want
the
tile
setters.
i
want
the
tile
setters
not
the
plasters.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
power
to
move
the
10
(k)
proceeding
is
in
the
two
unions?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
he
fire
them
for
refusing
to
do
the
work?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
union
would
set
exactly
could
be
in
that
set
and
also
said
that
they
have
union
with
the
client
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
whatever
done
is
one
of
the
unions
to
if
they
could
be
really
settled
the
dispute
to
also
define
--
why
would
the
union
to
gets
doom
then
fell
over
operative,
always
be
willing
to
define
if
there
is
a
federal.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
are
bound
by
that,
there
is
nothing
we
can
do
about
it,
and
maybe
agreed
to
it
and
it
is
really
set.
i
would
allow
if
ever
gone
with
the
union
with
the
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
i
said
the
settlement
could
union,
the
union
could
settle
their
between
themselves,
so
could
get
something
to
work,
alright?
well,
the
union
who
is
at
work
where
i
would
think
it
would
always
be
willing
the
disclaim.
and
a
board
any
of
possibility
of
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
board
(inaudible)
employer
though
that
even
if
it
settled
the
10
(k),
even
if
the
boardâ€™s
power
is
upheld
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
not
be
a
problem
here
as
one
of
the
unions
would
obey
the
joint
board?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
not
that
correct
that
if
the
tile
setters
would
disclaim
the
work,
the
whole
proceeding
would
be
aborted?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
why
does
not
the
tile
setters
do
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
the
tile
setters,
what
they
are
saying
is
that
we
did
have
a
voluntary
way
of
settling
our
dispute
through
the
joint
board,
but
we
just
would
not
comply.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
do
not
care
for
whatever
reason
that
is,
that
the
employers
never
bound,
whether
there
is
a
hearing
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
so,
i
do
not
know
what
kind
of
an
argument
that
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
employers
still
would
not
be
bound?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)nevertheless,
the
union
is
not
complying
with
the
joint
board
determination?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
--
if
it
did
and
disclaimed,
there
would
be
no
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
and
no
10
(k)
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
so
what
we
really
have
here
is
a
situation,
where
not
only
the
employer
has
not
agreed
to
the
settlement,
but
one
of
the
unions
has
done.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
(voice
overlap)
if
one
of
the
unions,
that
the
tile
setters
really
would
comply
with
the
joint
board
determination
--
justice
byron
r.
white
there
would
be
no
dispute
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
fact
is,
that
they
will
not
disclaim,
they
are
still
claiming
the
work
and
so
they
are
--
there
just
is
not
any
voluntary
adjustment
yet,
even
between
the
unions.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
are
refusing
to
comply,
and
they
are
still
claiming
the
work?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
would,
oh
yes,
there
would
still
be.
they
can
still
refuse
to
comply
and
they
could
still
strike,
they
could
still
get
(voice

justice
byron
r.
white
why
could
not
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
be
their
unfair
labor
practice?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
would
not
be
contrary
to
a
board
order?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
do
not
mean
--
i
mean
the
joint
board,
let
us
assume
the
joint
board
gave
it
to
the
plasters,
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
the
tile
setters
did
not
comply.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
if
the
board
gives
it
to
the
plasters
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
nlrb?
justice
byron
r.
white
gives
it
to
the
plasters,
then
the
tile
setters
are
bound?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
would
be
on
an
8
(b)
(4)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
8
(b)
(4)
(d).
justice
byron
r.
white
really,
what
you
are
saying
is
that
of
course
for
this
proviso
to
be
applicable,
you
have
to
assume
there
is
been
a
settlement
or
a
message
for
settlement.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
board
with
satisfactory
evidence
that
they
have
adjusted
or
agreed
upon
method
for
a
voluntary
adjustment
to
the
dispute.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
are
saying
what
the
board
must
do
is
to
recognize
the
fact
that
there
has
been
a
voluntary
adjustment
here
in
a
sense
that
if
the
joint
board
has
determined
the
dispute.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
the
board
must
recognize
that
one
union
is
bound
by
it.
i
mean
both
unions
are
bound
by
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
case
was
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
your
view
of
why
this
abstention
provision
is
triggered
here
where
a
union
has
apparently
agreed
upon
a
method
for
settlement,
but
then
repudiates
it
is
entire
undertaking
and
still
insists
on
having
the
work?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
then,
is
this
abstention
provision
triggered
when
not
even
one
of
the
unions
or
once
--
one
of
the
unions
has
been
agreed
on
the
affect?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree
but
apparently
one
of
the
unions
is
not
only
repudiated
this
agreement
to
abide
by
the
adjustment
but
they
had
repudiated
the
method
of
adjustment?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
we
were
still
going
to
claim
the
work
regardless
of
the
method
that
we
previously
agreed
on,
which
seems
to
me
a
repudiation
of
the
entire
procedure?
justice
byron
r.
white
an
agreement
between
two
unions?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
is
not
that
kind
of
an
issue
then
--
why
is
not
that
kind
of
an
issue
i
thought
for
one,
for
the
court
enforcement?
i
mean
that,
that
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
the
end
result
of
such
an
enforcement
proceeding
to
be
a
disclaimer?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
board's
answer
is
that
there
is
another
party,
but
the
employer,
but
if
the
board,
even
if
the
employer
is
a
party,
dismisses
the
proceeding,
when
there
is
a
disclaimer,
i
would
think
you
would
say,
or
what
you
do,
i
take
it
that
when
there
is
a
binding
method
agreed
upon,
the
board
should
recognize
that
it
is
binding
on
the
parties,
and
it
should
be
therefore,
given
to
a
disclaimer.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
even
if
the
employer
is
a
party?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why?
if
that
is
not
there,
it
could
not
be
strike
in
contrary
to
an
order,
it
is
just
a
dismissal
on
the
grounds
that
there
is
no
longer
the
basis
for
a
10
(k)
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
when
there
is
a
disclaimer
and
the
safeway
doctrine
is
applicable
and
the
proceeding
is
dismissed,
is
that
dismissal
order
the
--
would
the
dismissal
order
be
a
basis
for
a
charge?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
union
repudiated
the
disclaimer?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
is
not
binding
on
employer?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
a

order
say
by
the
way?
i

the
union
would
set
exactly
could
be
in
that
set
and
also
said
that
they
have
union
with
the
client
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
whatever
done
is
one
of
the
unions
to
if
they
could
be
really
settled
the
dispute
to
also
define
--
why
would
the
union
to
gets
doom
then
fell
over
operative,
always
be
willing
to
define
if
there
is
a
federal.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
are
bound
by
that,
there
is
nothing
we
can
do
about
it,
and
maybe
agreed
to
it
and
it
is
really
set.
i
would
allow
if
ever
gone
with
the
union
with
the
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
i
said
the
settlement
could
union,
the
union
could
settle
their
between
themselves,
so
could
get
something
to
work,
alright?
well,
the
union
who
is
at
work
where
i
would
think
it
would
always
be
willing
the
disclaim.
and
a
board
any
of
possibility
of
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
board
(inaudible)
employer
though
that
even
if
it
settled
the
10
(k),
even
if
the
boardâ€™s
power
is
upheld
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
not
be
a
problem
here
as
one
of
the
unions
would
obey
the
joint
board?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
not
that
correct
that
if
the
tile
setters
would
disclaim
the
work,
the
whole
proceeding
would
be
aborted?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
why
does
not
the
tile
setters
do
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
the
tile
setters,
what
they
are
saying
is
that
we
did
have
a
voluntary
way
of
settling
our
dispute
through
the
joint
board,
but
we
just
would
not
comply.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
do
not
care
for
whatever
reason
that
is,
that
the
employers
never
bound,
whether
there
is
a
hearing
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
so,
i
do
not
know
what
kind
of
an
argument
that
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
employers
still
would
not
be
bound?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)nevertheless,
the
union
is
not
complying
with
the
joint
board
determination?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
--
if
it
did
and
disclaimed,
there
would
be
no
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
and
no
10
(k)
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
so
what
we
really
have
here
is
a
situation,
where
not
only
the
employer
has
not
agreed
to
the
settlement,
but
one
of
the
unions
has
done.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
(voice
overlap)
if
one
of
the
unions,
that
the
tile
setters
really
would
comply
with
the
joint
board
determination
--
justice
byron
r.
white
there
would
be
no
dispute
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
fact
is,
that
they
will
not
disclaim,
they
are
still
claiming
the
work
and
so
they
are
--
there
just
is
not
any
voluntary
adjustment
yet,
even
between
the
unions.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
are
refusing
to
comply,
and
they
are
still
claiming
the
work?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
would,
oh
yes,
there
would
still
be.
they
can
still
refuse
to
comply
and
they
could
still
strike,
they
could
still
get
(voice
overlap)m
justice
byron
r.
white
why
could
not
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
be
their
unfair
labor
practice?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
would
not
be
contrary
to
a
board
order?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
do
not
mean
--
i
mean
the
joint
board,
let
us
assume
the
joint
board
gave
it
to
the
plasters,
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
the
tile
setters
did
not
comply.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
if
the
board
gives
it
to
the
plasters
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
nlrb?
justice
byron
r.
white
gives
it
to
the
plasters,
then
the
tile
setters
are
bound?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
would
be
on
an
8
(b)
(4)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
8
(b)
(4)
(d).
justice
byron
r.
white
really,
what
you
are
saying
is
that
of
course
for
this
proviso
to
be
applicable,
you
have
to
assume
there
is
been
a
settlement
or
a
message
for
settlement.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
board
with
satisfactory
evidence
that
they
have
adjusted
or
agreed
upon
method
for
a
voluntary
adjustment
to
the
dispute.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
are
saying
what
the
board
must
do
is
to
recognize
the
fact
that
there
has
been
a
voluntary
adjustment
here
in
a
sense
that
if
the
joint
board
has
determined
the
dispute.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
the
board
must
recognize
that
one
union
is
bound
by
it.
i
mean
both
unions
are
bound
by
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
case
was
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
your
view
of
why
this
abstention
provision
is
triggered
here
where
a
union
has
apparently
agreed
upon
a
method
for
settlement,
but
then
repudiates
it
is
entire
undertaking
and
still
insists
on
having
the
work?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
then,
is
this
abstention
provision
triggered
when
not
even
one
of
the
unions
or
once
--
one
of
the
unions
has
been
agreed
on
the
affect?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree
but
apparently
one
of
the
unions
is
not
only
repudiated
this
agreement
to
abide
by
the
adjustment
but
they
had
repudiated
the
method
of
adjustment?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
we
were
still
going
to
claim
the
work
regardless
of
the
method
that
we
previously
agreed
on,
which
seems
to
me
a
repudiation
of
the
entire
procedure?
justice
byron
r.
white
an
agreement
between
two
unions?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
is
not
that
kind
of
an
issue
then
--
why
is
not
that
kind
of
an
issue
i
thought
for
one,
for
the
court
enforcement?
i
mean
that,
that
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
the
end
result
of
such
an
enforcement
proceeding
to
be
a
disclaimer?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
board's
answer
is
that
there
is
another
party,
but
the
employer,
but
if
the
board,
even
if
the
employer
is
a
party,
dismisses
the
proceeding,
when
there
is
a
disclaimer,
i
would
think
you
would
say,
or
what
you
do,
i
take
it
that
when
there
is
a
binding
method
agreed
upon,
the
board
should
recognize
that
it
is
binding
on
the
parties,
and
it
should
be
therefore,
given
to
a
disclaimer.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
even
if
the
employer
is
a
party?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why?
if
that
is
not
there,
it
could
not
be
strike
in
contrary
to
an
order,
it
is
just
a
dismissal
on
the
grounds
that
there
is
no
longer
the
basis
for
a
10
(k)
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
when
there
is
a
disclaimer
and
the
safeway
doctrine
is
applicable
and
the
proceeding
is
dismissed,
is
that
dismissal
order
the
--
would
the
dismissal
order
be
a
basis
for
a
charge?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
union
repudiated
the
disclaimer?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
is
not
binding
on
employer?
