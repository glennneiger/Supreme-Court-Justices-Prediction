mr.

you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
the
petitioner
taken
in
to
custody
in
the
house
itself
where
the
disorder
was
--?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
i
was
asking,
was
there
any
effort
to
take
him
into
custody
at
the
time
he
was
on
the
floor?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
citizens
have
the
privileges
of
the
floor
of
the
legislative
houses
of
the
wisconsin
legislature.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
alone
could
probably
warrant
the
charge
of
contempt
independent
of
whether
it
was
in
fact
disorderly,
i
suppose.
i
said
warrant,
warrant
of
charge
not
the
conviction.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
the
disorderly
conduct
charges
never
then
pursued.
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
say
available,
do
you
mean
by
that
constitutionally,
the
state
of
wisconsin
has
to
adopt
some
counterpart
of
a
federal
reference
to
a
additional
proceedings?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
do
not
contempt
they
have
any
right
to
do
that
of
course?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
only
necessary
in
your
case,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no
review
is
provided
of
the
legislative
determination
of
that
kind.
is
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
we
take
just
that
part
of
your
arguments
about
the
contours
of
the
room
and
the
other
factors
about
the
functioning
of
a
legislative
body,
then
it
would
not
have
been
feasible
on
your
theory
that
you
have
tried
justice
samuel
chase
for
impeachment
by
the
senate
180
years
ago,
170
years
ago
or
to
try
president
johnson
for
impeachment
100
years
ago.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
contour
of
the
room
are
the
same.
are
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
speaking
now
of
the
body.
the
members
of
the
legislative
body
in
a
sense
as
the
witnesses
who
observed
the
event,
not
of
the
trial
of
the
man
for
contempt
before
the
body.
that
is
correct
or
i
misunderstood
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
posture
but
would
you
make
the
same
argument
with
reference
to
the
un-feasibility
of
conducting
on
the
trial
before
the
body?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
it
follows
from
your
argument,
i
take
it
that
the
only
remedy
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
has
against
someone
occupying
legislature
for
ten
or
twelve
hours
is
to
charge
or
just
sort
of
a
conduct
as
there
was
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
coffey.
mr.
tinglum.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
for
conduct
occurring
where?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
it
was
the
same
conduct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
response
i
think
was
a
little
confusing.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
to
make
sure
we
have
it
clear.
it
was
at
time
of
contempt
citation,
he
was
in
custody
on
a
disorderly
conduct
charge
for
the
same
conduct
that
the
legislature
was
deeming
with.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
is
the
case
that
ended
in
a
mistrial
and
it
was
followed
by
dismissal?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
12
noon
until
approximately
midnight,
the
legislature
was
in
effect
ousted
of
its
own
chamber.
is
that
not
the
case
on
this
record?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
has
been
some
reference
to
the
procedure
followed
by
judge
medina
in
the
contempt
cases
that
occurred
during
prolonged
trial
in
new
york,
years
ago.
now,
suppose
hypothetically
that
the
legislature
decided
deliberately
to
postpone
the
action
on
the
contempt
until
the
last
day
of
the
session
or
last
week
of
the
session
in
order
to
let
tempers
cool
and
get
a
more
objective
view,
would
that
be
a
perfectly
valid
reason
for
waiting
30
days
or
60
days
or
90
days
and
who
is
to
complain
about
that
kind
of
a
delay
for
that
reason?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
only
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
contempt
powers.
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
not
the
whole
basis
for
giving
legislative
body
contempt
power?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
taking
example
of
someone
as
a
deterrent
to
similar
future
conduct
by
others?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
you
have
four
minutes
left
mr.
coffey.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
coffey
do
you
suggest
that
judicial
review
of
a
legislative
contempt
determination
would
be
available,
for
example
on
the
weight
of
the
evidence
or
just
on
procedural
regularity?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
you
are
suggesting
on
is
that
the
judicial
branch
would
have
the
power
to
re-determine
the
fact
as
distinguished
from
passing
merely
on
procedural
regularity
of
the
contempt
process?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
not
contrary
to
the
general
line
of
authority
in
both
the
english
and
the
early
american
cases
also,
the
review
of
the
merits?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
this
was
probably
reasonably
false
in
the
category
dicta
by
the
court
in
the
wisconsin
case,
does
it
not?
chief
