justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
notice
at
page
61
(a),
a
proceeding
apparently
brought
by
the
state
against
groppi
and
others,
a
statement
at
page
62
(a)
that
the
complaints
and
the
affidavits
attached
in
this
case
in
substance
to
cite
most
of
the
facts
that
were
stated,
the
balance
having
them
confined
by
testimony
and
what
precedes
at
page
61
(a)
and
62
(a)
seem
to
be
substantial
like
that
which
appears
in
the
per
curiam
of
the
supreme
court
at
113a,
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.

i
see.
did

happen
after

is
dated

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
october
10?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
to
expressly
authorize
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
not
the
13.72?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
applied
only
in
the
case
of
one,
actually
a
judge
guilty
by
the
house?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
under
the
general
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
federal
statute
is
expressed
is
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
authorizes
reference
expressly
in
the
case
that
contempts
found
by
the
house.
that
is
required
to
make
a
federal
statue
first
is
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
we
sustain
that
a
resolution
that
you
want
us
to
do
--
and
that
there
was
a
problem
of
double
jeopardy,
nothing
else
could
happen
anyway.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
sort
of
an
empty
argument
is
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
