mr.
william
m.
coffey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
is
before
the
court
on
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
the
pertinent
facts
out
of
which
this
matter
arose
are
as
follows.
on
october
1,
1969
the
assembly,
one
of
the
two
houses
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
legislature
passed
a
resolution
reciting
that
two
days
earlier
on
september
29th,
1969,
the
petitioner
led
a
gathering
of
the
people
which
by
its
presence
on
the
floor
of
the
assembly
during
a
meeting
prevented
the
assembly
from
conducting
its
business.
the
resolution
found
the
petitioner's
conduct
constituted
disorderly
conduct
in
the
immediate
view
of
the
house
and
directly
tending
to
interrupt
its
proceedings.
the
resolution
then
cited
the
petitioner
for
contempt
and
ordered
that
he
be
imprisoned
in
the
dane
county
jail
for
a
period
of
six
months
or
for
the
balance
of
the
legislative
session
whichever
was
briefer.
petitioner
was
given
no
notice
of
the
charge
against
him
and
was
given
no
hearing
of
any
kind,
either
before
the
resolution
was
passed
or
after
the
resolution
was
passed.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
no
your
honor.
chief
justice,
the
disturbance
had
occurred
two
days
previously
and
--
mr.
william
m.
coffey
none
at
all.
at
the
time,
the
resolution
was
passed,
the
petitioner
was
in
fact
incarcerated
in
the
dane
county
jail
under
a
disorderly
conduct
charge
which
had
been
placed
against
him
arising
out
of
the
same
conduct
dealt
with
the
legislative
resolution.
the
petitioner
was
served
with
copy
of
the
resolution
and
he
was
then
confined
in
the
dane
county
jail
pursuant
to
the
authority
of
the
resolution.
after
this,
he
was
served
with
the
copy
of
the
resolution,
he
instituted
various
legal
actions
contesting
the
constitutionality
of
the
procedures
employed
by
the
legislature
in
imprisoning
him
for
six
months.
writs
of
habeas
corpus
were
denied
by
the
circuit
court
of
dane
county
and
by
the
wisconsin
supreme
court.
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
was
filed
in
the
united
state
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
wisconsin.
a
response
was
filed
and
the
district
court
thereupon
released
the
petitioner
on
bail,
pending
the
determination
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
bail
had
been
denied
to
the
petitioner
by
both
the
circuit
court
of
dane
county
and
by
the
wisconsin
supreme
court.
all
of
the
petitions
for
habeas
corpus
filed
by
the
petitioner
alleged
that
he
had
been
denied
due
process
law
and
that
he
had
been
denied
the
right
to
be
represented
by
counsel,
the
right
to
a
trial
or
a
hearing
of
any
kind,
the
right
to
compulsory
process.
the
right
to
be
informed
of
the
nature
and
cause
of
the
accusation
against
him.
the
right
to
confront
his
accusers
and
the
right
to
present
his
defense,
the
alleged
charges.
on
april
8th,
1970
the
district
court
held
that
the
legislative
assembly
could
not
summarily
impose
a
jail
sentence
for
a
legislative
contempt
without
first
providing
the
petitioner
some
minimal
opportunity
to
appear
and
respond
to
the
charge.
the
court
granted
the
writ
and
ordered
the
petitioner,
release
under
any
further
restrain
or
custody
pursuant
to
the
resolution.
the
respondent
appealed
the
decision
of
the
district
court
of
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
on
appeal
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
was
reversed.
subsequently
the
court
of
appeals
granted
petitioner's
request
for
re-hearing
on
bond
and
in
a
4:3
decision
affirmed
the
earlier
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
issues
presented
on
the
appeal
are
whether
a
legislative
body
can
consistent
with
due
process
law
two
days
after
alleged
contemptuous
conduct,
ex
parte
impersonate
person
under
its
contempt
power
without
giving
the
person
any
notice
of
the
charge
against
him
or
any
opportunity,
whatsoever
to
appear
before
the
legislative
body
and
respond
to
the
charges.
the
second
issue
is
whether
consistent
with
a
due
process
clause,
a
person
can
be
found
in
contempt
to
the
legislative
body
when
the
contempt
resolutions
sets
forth
mere
conclusion
and
failed
to
set
forth
any
of
the
underlying
facts
and
circumstances
which
constituted
the
alleged
contemptuous
behavior.
the
petitioner
respectfully
contend
that
the
wisconsin
legislature
did
not
have
the
power
to
summarily
punish
for
contempt.
the
petitioner
--
mr.
william
m.
coffey
your
honor
that
was
one
of
the
problems
that
was
confronted
in
the
matter
and
that
no
record
of
these
proceedings
was
made.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
that
was
a
judicial
notice
taken
of
accounts
in
the
mass
media,
newspapers
and
television
accounts
of
what
had
occurred.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
that
is
indicated
in
the
opinion,
your
honor,
of
the
district
court
in
that.
the
actual
language
of
the
district
court,
i
do
not
know,
but
there
had
been
no
hearing
of
any
kind
and
was
indicated
that
that
was
judicial
notice
of
those
facts
and
those
media
sources.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
and
with
the
only
available
source
of
those
facts
or
material
at
that
time
because
there
had
been
no
evidentiary
hearing
either
in
a
court
or
in
the
legislative
body.
no
record
made
of
the
proceeding
by
the
legislature
was
the
media.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
i
do
not
believe
justice
that
there
is
any
contention
that
the
petitioner
was
not
in
fact
on
the
floor
of
the
assembly.
i
think
there
maybe
some
contention
as
to
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
personally
engaged
in
conduct
that
was
disorderly.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
he
was
never
given
such
an
opportunity
to
respond
in
any
way
to
the
charge.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
not
during
the
session
chief
justice.
it
was
the
presence
of
the
body
of
the
people
on
the
floor,
the
assembly
was
in
violation
of
a
rule
of
the
assembly.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
yes,
that
may
well
is
a
violation
of
the
rule
where
we
would
probably
proceed
on
some
basis
that
as
we
have
been
indicated
here,
we
have
proceeded
throughout
these
proceedings
that
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
like
all
legislatures
has
a
contempt
power.
the
question
is
what
is
the
scope
for
that
contempt
power
and
what
procedures
must
they
follow
in
exercising
the
contempt
power.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
no,
chief
justice
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
day
prior
to
the
passing
of
this
resolution
by
the
assembly.
the
petitioner
had,
in
fact,
then
charged
with
disorderly
conduct,
he
in
fact,
after
the
resolution
was
issued
had
a
jury
trial
on
that
charge
of
disorderly
conduct
and
after
the
jury
had
deliberated
and
was
unable
to
return
a
verdict.
the
trial
court
granted
the
defendants
motions
for
dismissal
or
judgment
of
acquittal
which
he
had
taken
under
advisement
at
the
conclusion
of
all
the
cases.
he,
in
fact,
successfully
defended
the
criminal
disorderly
conduct
charge.
in
regard
to
the
summary
contempt
powers,
courts
have
clearly
exercised
summary
contempt
policy.
however,
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
always
limited
the
exercise
to
the
exercise
of
that
power
to
those
situations
where
the
misconduct
is
actually
observed
by
the
court
and
where
immediate
punishment
was
necessary
to
restore
order
and
maintain
the
dignity
and
authority
of
the
court
because
of
the
dangers
inherent
in
the
summary
contempt
power
which
has
been
described
as
perhaps
nearest
akin
to
despotic
power
of
any
power
existing
under
our
form
of
government,
this
court
has
construed
it
as
an
exception
to
the
normal
requirements
of
due
process
and
has
refused
to
extend
it
particularly
in
johnson
versus
mississippi,
mayberry
versus
pennsylvania.
the
summary
power
has
never
before
in
the
history
of
this
country
prior
to
october
1,
1969
ever
been
exercised
by
a
legislative
body.
a
good
reason
exists
for
not
extending
that
power
to
the
legislature.
first,
and
i
think
foremost,
courts
differ
significantly
from
legislatures.
it
is
the
duty
and
the
business
of
courts
to
determine
and
decide
particular
cases
free
from
the
exercise
of
the
external
influences
as
judge
stevens
noted
in
his
dissenting
opinion
on
the
unbound
hearing
without
reflecting
adversely
on
the
importance
and
dignity
of
the
legislative
function.
it
must
be
recognized
that
legislators
are
more
responsive
to
the
temporary
moods
of
the
body
politics
than
our
judges.
and
further
in
this
case,
in
johnson
v.
mississippi,
this
court
held
that
a
judge
who
was
so
enmeshed
in
matters
involved
was
so
enmeshed
that
matters
involving
a
defendant
that
it
was
appropriate
for
another
judge
to
seat
and
determine
the
question
of
this
contempt
and
indicate
noting
that
the
trial
before
an
unbiased
judge
was
essential
to
due
process.
in
this
case
given
the
responsiveness
of
the
body
power
or
legislatures
through
the
pressures
or
the
mood,
in
particular
political
mood
at
the
time,
i
do
not
think
you
could
view
the
wisconsin
assembly
at
this
point
as
an
unbiased
judge.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
yes
it
is.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
i
am
saying
that
there
must
be
a
hearing
and
i
would
suggest
that
it
not
be
before
the
legislature.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
as
in
the
federal
system
justice
stewart,
the
matters
are
referred
to
the
united
sates
attorney
for
persecution
in
the
judicial
process
where
the
full
panoply
of
the
procedural
due
process
rights
are
observe.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
well,
i
think
--
mr.
william
m.
coffey
i
think
at
this
juncture
i
would
say
that
notice
and
hearing
even
before
that
legislature
is
minimal,
but
i
would
think
that
there
is
some
considerations
to
the
idea
that
it
should
not
be
before
the
assembly
and
that
other
procedures
could
be
available
and
the
particularly
--
mr.
william
m.
coffey
i
think
justice
that
if
they
are
--
it
has
been
the
position
of
the
respondent
that
they
cannot
afford
the
petitioner
due
process,
because
that
would
overburden
the
legislative
system
and
may
draw
the
legislature
to
a
halt
and
i
feel
that
if
the
legislature
is
unable
to
afford
due
process,
then
yes,
i
would
think
that
constitutionally
are
mandated
to
adapt
some
other
procedure
where
by
due
process
will
be
afforded.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
yes.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
justice
brennan,
in
an
answer
to
your
question,
testimony,
the
pages
to
which
you
are
refer
are
the
findings
of
a
circuit
judge
in
dane
county
who
had
conducted
a
hearing
on
the
respondents
motions
for
temporary
restraining
order.
and
then
there
was
a
hearing
on
the
preliminary.
this
record
where
this
testimony
to
my
knowledge
was
not
available
to
wisconsin
supreme
court
at
the
time
it
rendered
its
decision.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
yes,
the
court
beliefs
--
mr.
william
m.
coffey
correct,
and
i
believe
the
action
of
the
wisconsin
--
mr.
william
m.
coffey
yes,
and
i
believe
the
action
of
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
in
denying
--
mr.
william
m.
coffey
no,
they
are
not
part
of
the
record,
justice
brennan.
the
action
of
wisconsin
supreme
court
in
denying
the
petitioner’s
writ
of
habeas
corpus
was
october
10.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
yes.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
yes,
i
would
concede
that
fact
and
that
i
know
of
my
knowledge
that
it
occurred
justice
blackmun,
but
it
was
never
established
in
any
proceeding
that
i
am
aware
of
with
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
where
there
was
one
testimony
that
was
obviously
reported
in
the
media.
now,
in
this
particular
action,
the
people
led
in
the
assembly
or
people
that
were
present
in
the
assembly
were
in
fact
there
to
object
to
or
make
known
objections
to
regard
to
legislative
action
in
terms
of
cutting
back
welfare
payment.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
no,
i
did
not
chief
justice
i
only
--
mr.
william
m.
coffey
no,
it
is
not
and
i
only
bring
that
up,
because
i
believe
that
it
raises
some
question
as
to
the
ability
of
the
legislature
to
sit
as
fair
and
impartial
judge
of
the
contempt.
secondly
in
terms
of
the
legislative
contempt,
the
physical
contours
of
most
legislative
chambers
along
with
the
comings
and
goings
of
the
people
in
the
legislature
during
the
session,
the
absence
of
transcribed
records
make
it
reasonable
as
the
district
court
found
and
as
judge
stevens
noted
in
his
dissenting
opinion
that
there
is
the
room
for
error
in
perception
and
evaluation
of
the
alleged
contemptuous
conduct
is
far
greater
and
in
a
legislative
body
then
before
a
court
in
the
restricted
area
in
which
a
court
may
make
a
summary
contempt
finding.
additionally,
a
review
of
the
action
taken
by
the
legislature
is
almost
impossible.
it
is
extremely
difficult
if
not
almost
impossible.
in
the
instant
case
--
mr.
william
m.
coffey
there
was
none
in
this
case
chief
justice
burger
and
that
was
one
of
the
problems,
is
that
when
the
petitioner
filed
his
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
wisconsin
supreme
court,
there
was
authority,
and
all
cases
prior
to
that
time
in
wisconsin
which
indicated
that,
in
fact,
the
court
would
not
review
a
finding
of
a
legislature.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
no,
the
trial
for
impeachment,
i
do
not
see
any
difficult--
mr.
william
m.
coffey
but
the
people
are
there
taking
part,
and
they
were
having
a
trial.
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
the
contours
of
the
legislative
body
make
it
difficult
to
perceive
a
heavy
uniform
perception
and
evaluation
of
conduct
that
it
is
going
on
in
that
large
an
area.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
no,
i
would
not
clearly
believe
that
a
trial
could
be
conducted.
i
would
hate
to
see
that
portion
under
the
legislative
machinery
and
that
obviously
it
would
cause
a
great
disruption
of
the
normal
legislative
process.
if
they
would
have
a
full
blown
trial,
but
i
clearly
think
the
chamber
with
the
special
place
to
have
the
trial.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
or
to
--
yes
they
could
bring
charges
under
the
ordinary
criminal
code,
unlawful
assembly
and
all
other
sorts
of
criminal
offenses,
but
additionally
i
believe
that
they
could
certify
one
as
the
federal
government
us
attorney
for
contempt
or
they
could
in
fact
have
a
hearing.
they
could
have
in
fact
had
a
hearing
in
district
court.
all
the
district
court
said
that
was
constitutionally
mandated
was
a
minimal
opportunity
to
appear
in
the
response,
in
all
of
the
cases
cited
in
the
respondent's
brief
of
a
legislative
contempt.
that
is
in
fact
the
procedure
that
was
followed.
the
contemnor
was
just
brought
in
before
the
bar
of
the
house
or
the
senate
and
advised
that
the
house
or
the
legislative
body
viewed
certain
of
his
conduct
as
contemptuous.
what
if
anything
did
he
have
to
say
as
to
why
he
should
not
be
held
in
contempt?
and,
that
is
what
the
district
court
said
was
constitutionally
mandated.
the
district
court
did
not
conceive
a
full
blown
trial.
i
feel
that
the
petitioner
is
entitled
to
that
at
a
minimum
and
that
he
may
well
be
entitled
to
more
procedural
due
process
than
just
that
minimum
or
minimal
due
process.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
yes.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
mr.
justice
blackmun
in
terms
of
mootness,
the
resolution
in
addition
to
holding
the
petitioner
in
contempt,
there
was
also
a
second
part
of
the
resolution
which
under
pursuant
to
the
section
1327
of
the
statutes
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
referred
the
matter
to
the
district
attorney
of
dane
county.
section
1327,
that
the
statute
to
the
state
of
wisconsin
sub-paragraph
2,
provides
that
any
person
who
is
adjudged
guilty.

(a)
of
the
petition
for
a
petition
for
writ.
i
am
sorry
it
is
not
in
the
appendix.
the
statute
provides
that
any
person
that
is
adjudged
guilty
of
any
contempt
of
the
legislature
or
either
house
thereof
shall
be
deemed
guilty
also
by
misdemeanor
and
after
the
adjournment
of
such
a
legislature
maybe
prosecuted
therefore
in
dane
county
and
maybe
fined
not
more
than
$200.00
or
imprisoned
not
more
than
one
year
in
the
county
jail.
the
legislative
assembly
that
held
the
petitioner
in
contempt
adjourned
sini
die
on
either
january
6th
or
january
7th
of
1971.
the
prosecution
contemplated
by
the
resolution
of
the
assembly
has
not
been
to
this
date
commenced,
but
there
is
the
thread
of
this
prosecution.
i
would
indicate
that
i
think
in
terms
of
collateral
estoppel
or
double
jeopardy,
there
maybe
some
defenses
to
that
prosecution,
but
there
is
the
thread
of
that
prosecution
which
i
believe
would
bring
this
matter
under
the
doctrine
of
this
court
in
sibron
versus
new
york
and
carafas
v.
lavallee,
and
i
would
suggest
that
the
matter
is
not
moot.
thank
you.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
mr.
chief
justice,
the
inquiry,
the
respondent
has
preceded
that
the
summary
contempt
power
is
very
great
power
subject
to
abuse.
in
the
instance
case,
there
is
no
way
that
the
petitioner
has
ever
been
able
to
get
a
review,
the
factual
basis
on
which
the
legislature
asked.
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
in
denying
the
petition
to
writ
habeas
corpus
suggested
that
some
type
of
judicial
review
was
available.
we
filed
a
motion
of
petition
for
rehearing
in
the
wisconsin
supreme
court,
and
requested
--
indicated
that
their
opinion
indicated
such
a
judicial
review
was
available.
all
of
the
authority
that
we
had
found
indicated
to
contrary,
would
the
court
please
advise
the
petitioner,
what
kind
of
hearing
was
available
to
him
and
grant
him
that
hearing,
but
even
assuming
that
he
could
have
gotten
the
hearing
at
that
time,
i
think
we
must
recognize
that
hearing
comes
too
late.
the
petitioner
was
already
in
jail
pursuant
to
the
contempt
resolution
and
at
that
point
he
had
been
denied
bail
and
i
do
not
believe
that
he
should
have
his
right
to
a
hearing
on
the
factual
basis
of
the
contempt
after
he
is
already
in
jail.
i
think,
the
hearing
should
precede
the
right
of
anyone
to
place
him
in
custody.
i
suggest
that
as
the
district
court
held
that
at
a
very
minimum,
the
petitioner
was
entitled
to
be
given
notice
of
the
charges
against
him
and
be
given
an
opportunity
to
respond
to
them.
thank
you.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
i
would
suggest
mr.
chief
justice
that
it
has
to
be
available
on
both
or
there
would
be
no
basis
on
which
to
check
the
arbitrary
exercised
power
by
the
legislature.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
i
think
that
is
essential
mr.
chief
justice.
or
there
is
no
check
on
completely
arbitrary
incarceration
of
people
that
these
please
the
legislative
body
and
there
has
to
be
a
check
on
that
kind
of
party.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
the
wisconsin
–
mr.
william
m.
coffey
they
did
suggest
that
which
is
contrary
as
the
district
court
opinion
noted
was
contrary
to
the
existing
case,
warned
wisconsin
at
the
time
and
when
the
petitioner
asked
for
that
hearing
the
motion
for
rehearing
was
denied
without
hearing
and
without
comment.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
yes
it
is
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
either
that
or
an
overruling
of
other
authority
without
expressly
doing.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
no.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
is
before
the
court
on
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
the
pertinent
facts
out
of
which
this
matter
arose
are
as
follows.
on
october
1,
1969
the
assembly,
one
of
the
two
houses
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
legislature
passed
a
resolution
reciting
that
two
days
earlier
on
september
29th,
1969,
the
petitioner
led
a
gathering
of
the
people
which
by
its
presence
on
the
floor
of
the
assembly
during
a
meeting
prevented
the
assembly
from
conducting
its
business.
the
resolution
found
the
petitioner's
conduct
constituted
disorderly
conduct
in
the
immediate
view
of
the
house
and
directly
tending
to
interrupt
its
proceedings.
the
resolution
then
cited
the
petitioner
for
contempt
and
ordered
that
he
be
imprisoned
in
the
dane
county
jail
for
a
period
of
six
months
or
for
the
balance
of
the
legislative
session
whichever
was
briefer.
petitioner
was
given
no
notice
of
the
charge
against
him
and
was
given
no
hearing
of
any
kind,
either
before
the
resolution
was
passed
or
after
the
resolution
was
passed.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
no
your
honor.
chief
justice,
the
disturbance
had
occurred
two
days
previously
and
--
mr.
william
m.
coffey
none
at
all.
at
the
time,
the
resolution
was
passed,
the
petitioner
was
in
fact
incarcerated
in
the
dane
county
jail
under
a
disorderly
conduct
charge
which
had
been
placed
against
him
arising
out
of
the
same
conduct
dealt
with
the
legislative
resolution.
the
petitioner
was
served
with
copy
of
the
resolution
and
he
was
then
confined
in
the
dane
county
jail
pursuant
to
the
authority
of
the
resolution.
after
this,
he
was
served
with
the
copy
of
the
resolution,
he
instituted
various
legal
actions
contesting
the
constitutionality
of
the
procedures
employed
by
the
legislature
in
imprisoning
him
for
six
months.
writs
of
habeas
corpus
were
denied
by
the
circuit
court
of
dane
county
and
by
the
wisconsin
supreme
court.
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
was
filed
in
the
united
state
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
wisconsin.
a
response
was
filed
and
the
district
court
thereupon
released
the
petitioner
on
bail,
pending
the
determination
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
bail
had
been
denied
to
the
petitioner
by
both
the
circuit
court
of
dane
county
and
by
the
wisconsin
supreme
court.
all
of
the
petitions
for
habeas
corpus
filed
by
the
petitioner
alleged
that
he
had
been
denied
due
process
law
and
that
he
had
been
denied
the
right
to
be
represented
by
counsel,
the
right
to
a
trial
or
a
hearing
of
any
kind,
the
right
to
compulsory
process.
the
right
to
be
informed
of
the
nature
and
cause
of
the
accusation
against
him.
the
right
to
confront
his
accusers
and
the
right
to
present
his
defense,
the
alleged
charges.
on
april
8th,
1970
the
district
court
held
that
the
legislative
assembly
could
not
summarily
impose
a
jail
sentence
for
a
legislative
contempt
without
first
providing
the
petitioner
some
minimal
opportunity
to
appear
and
respond
to
the
charge.
the
court
granted
the
writ
and
ordered
the
petitioner,
release
under
any
further
restrain
or
custody
pursuant
to
the
resolution.
the
respondent
appealed
the
decision
of
the
district
court
of
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
on
appeal
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
was
reversed.
subsequently
the
court
of
appeals
granted
petitioner's
request
for
re-hearing
on
bond
and
in
a
4:3
decision
affirmed
the
earlier
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
issues
presented
on
the
appeal
are
whether
a
legislative
body
can
consistent
with
due
process
law
two
days
after
alleged
contemptuous
conduct,
ex
parte
impersonate
person
under
its
contempt
power
without
giving
the
person
any
notice
of
the
charge
against
him
or
any
opportunity,
whatsoever
to
appear
before
the
legislative
body
and
respond
to
the
charges.
the
second
issue
is
whether
consistent
with
a
due
process
clause,
a
person
can
be
found
in
contempt
to
the
legislative
body
when
the
contempt
resolutions
sets
forth
mere
conclusion
and
failed
to
set
forth
any
of
the
underlying
facts
and
circumstances
which
constituted
the
alleged
contemptuous
behavior.
the
petitioner
respectfully
contend
that
the
wisconsin
legislature
did
not
have
the
power
to
summarily
punish
for
contempt.
the
petitioner
--
mr.
william
m.
coffey
your
honor
that
was
one
of
the
problems
that
was
confronted
in
the
matter
and
that
no
record
of
these
proceedings
was
made.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
that
was
a
judicial
notice
taken
of
accounts
in
the
mass
media,
newspapers
and
television
accounts
of
what
had
occurred.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
that
is
indicated
in
the
opinion,
your
honor,
of
the
district
court
in
that.
the
actual
language
of
the
district
court,
i
do
not
know,
but
there
had
been
no
hearing
of
any
kind
and
was
indicated
that
that
was
judicial
notice
of
those
facts
and
those
media
sources.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
and
with
the
only
available
source
of
those
facts
or
material
at
that
time
because
there
had
been
no
evidentiary
hearing
either
in
a
court
or
in
the
legislative
body.
no
record
made
of
the
proceeding
by
the
legislature
was
the
media.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
i
do
not
believe
justice
that
there
is
any
contention
that
the
petitioner
was
not
in
fact
on
the
floor
of
the
assembly.
i
think
there
maybe
some
contention
as
to
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
personally
engaged
in
conduct
that
was
disorderly.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
he
was
never
given
such
an
opportunity
to
respond
in
any
way
to
the
charge.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
not
during
the
session
chief
justice.
it
was
the
presence
of
the
body
of
the
people
on
the
floor,
the
assembly
was
in
violation
of
a
rule
of
the
assembly.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
yes,
that
may
well
is
a
violation
of
the
rule
where
we
would
probably
proceed
on
some
basis
that
as
we
have
been
indicated
here,
we
have
proceeded
throughout
these
proceedings
that
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
like
all
legislatures
has
a
contempt
power.
the
question
is
what
is
the
scope
for
that
contempt
power
and
what
procedures
must
they
follow
in
exercising
the
contempt
power.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
no,
chief
justice
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
day
prior
to
the
passing
of
this
resolution
by
the
assembly.
the
petitioner
had,
in
fact,
then
charged
with
disorderly
conduct,
he
in
fact,
after
the
resolution
was
issued
had
a
jury
trial
on
that
charge
of
disorderly
conduct
and
after
the
jury
had
deliberated
and
was
unable
to
return
a
verdict.
the
trial
court
granted
the
defendants
motions
for
dismissal
or
judgment
of
acquittal
which
he
had
taken
under
advisement
at
the
conclusion
of
all
the
cases.
he,
in
fact,
successfully
defended
the
criminal
disorderly
conduct
charge.
in
regard
to
the
summary
contempt
powers,
courts
have
clearly
exercised
summary
contempt
policy.
however,
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
always
limited
the
exercise
to
the
exercise
of
that
power
to
those
situations
where
the
misconduct
is
actually
observed
by
the
court
and
where
immediate
punishment
was
necessary
to
restore
order
and
maintain
the
dignity
and
authority
of
the
court
because
of
the
dangers
inherent
in
the
summary
contempt
power
which
has
been
described
as
perhaps
nearest
akin
to
despotic
power
of
any
power
existing
under
our
form
of
government,
this
court
has
construed
it
as
an
exception
to
the
normal
requirements
of
due
process
and
has
refused
to
extend
it
particularly
in
johnson
versus
mississippi,
mayberry
versus
pennsylvania.
the
summary
power
has
never
before
in
the
history
of
this
country
prior
to
october
1,
1969
ever
been
exercised
by
a
legislative
body.
a
good
reason
exists
for
not
extending
that
power
to
the
legislature.
first,
and
i
think
foremost,
courts
differ
significantly
from
legislatures.
it
is
the
duty
and
the
business
of
courts
to
determine
and
decide
particular
cases
free
from
the
exercise
of
the
external
influences
as
judge
stevens
noted
in
his
dissenting
opinion
on
the
unbound
hearing
without
reflecting
adversely
on
the
importance
and
dignity
of
the
legislative
function.
it
must
be
recognized
that
legislators
are
more
responsive
to
the
temporary
moods
of
the
body
politics
than
our
judges.
and
further
in
this
case,
in
johnson
v.
mississippi,
this
court
held
that
a
judge
who
was
so
enmeshed
in
matters
involved
was
so
enmeshed
that
matters
involving
a
defendant
that
it
was
appropriate
for
another
judge
to
seat
and
determine
the
question
of
this
contempt
and
indicate
noting
that
the
trial
before
an
unbiased
judge
was
essential
to
due
process.
in
this
case
given
the
responsiveness
of
the
body
power
or
legislatures
through
the
pressures
or
the
mood,
in
particular
political
mood
at
the
time,
i
do
not
think
you
could
view
the
wisconsin
assembly
at
this
point
as
an
unbiased
judge.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
yes
it
is.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
i
am
saying
that
there
must
be
a
hearing
and
i
would
suggest
that
it
not
be
before
the
legislature.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
as
in
the
federal
system
justice
stewart,
the
matters
are
referred
to
the
united
sates
attorney
for
persecution
in
the
judicial
process
where
the
full
panoply
of
the
procedural
due
process
rights
are
observe.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
well,
i
think
--
mr.
william
m.
coffey
i
think
at
this
juncture
i
would
say
that
notice
and
hearing
even
before
that
legislature
is
minimal,
but
i
would
think
that
there
is
some
considerations
to
the
idea
that
it
should
not
be
before
the
assembly
and
that
other
procedures
could
be
available
and
the
particularly
--
mr.
william
m.
coffey
i
think
justice
that
if
they
are
--
it
has
been
the
position
of
the
respondent
that
they
cannot
afford
the
petitioner
due
process,
because
that
would
overburden
the
legislative
system
and
may
draw
the
legislature
to
a
halt
and
i
feel
that
if
the
legislature
is
unable
to
afford
due
process,
then
yes,
i
would
think
that
constitutionally
are
mandated
to
adapt
some
other
procedure
where
by
due
process
will
be
afforded.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
yes.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
justice
brennan,
in
an
answer
to
your
question,
testimony,
the
pages
to
which
you
are
refer
are
the
findings
of
a
circuit
judge
in
dane
county
who
had
conducted
a
hearing
on
the
respondents
motions
for
temporary
restraining
order.
and
then
there
was
a
hearing
on
the
preliminary.
this
record
where
this
testimony
to
my
knowledge
was
not
available
to
wisconsin
supreme
court
at
the
time
it
rendered
its
decision.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
yes,
the
court
beliefs
--
mr.
william
m.
coffey
correct,
and
i
believe
the
action
of
the
wisconsin
--
mr.
william
m.
coffey
yes,
and
i
believe
the
action
of
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
in
denying
--
mr.
william
m.
coffey
no,
they
are
not
part
of
the
record,
justice
brennan.
the
action
of
wisconsin
supreme
court
in
denying
the
petitioner’s
writ
of
habeas
corpus
was
october
10.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
yes.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
yes,
i
would
concede
that
fact
and
that
i
know
of
my
knowledge
that
it
occurred
justice
blackmun,
but
it
was
never
established
in
any
proceeding
that
i
am
aware
of
with
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
where
there
was
one
testimony
that
was
obviously
reported
in
the
media.
now,
in
this
particular
action,
the
people
led
in
the
assembly
or
people
that
were
present
in
the
assembly
were
in
fact
there
to
object
to
or
make
known
objections
to
regard
to
legislative
action
in
terms
of
cutting
back
welfare
payment.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
no,
i
did
not
chief
justice
i
only
--
mr.
william
m.
coffey
no,
it
is
not
and
i
only
bring
that
up,
because
i
believe
that
it
raises
some
question
as
to
the
ability
of
the
legislature
to
sit
as
fair
and
impartial
judge
of
the
contempt.
secondly
in
terms
of
the
legislative
contempt,
the
physical
contours
of
most
legislative
chambers
along
with
the
comings
and
goings
of
the
people
in
the
legislature
during
the
session,
the
absence
of
transcribed
records
make
it
reasonable
as
the
district
court
found
and
as
judge
stevens
noted
in
his
dissenting
opinion
that
there
is
the
room
for
error
in
perception
and
evaluation
of
the
alleged
contemptuous
conduct
is
far
greater
and
in
a
legislative
body
then
before
a
court
in
the
restricted
area
in
which
a
court
may
make
a
summary
contempt
finding.
additionally,
a
review
of
the
action
taken
by
the
legislature
is
almost
impossible.
it
is
extremely
difficult
if
not
almost
impossible.
in
the
instant
case
--
mr.
william
m.
coffey
there
was
none
in
this
case
chief
justice
burger
and
that
was
one
of
the
problems,
is
that
when
the
petitioner
filed
his
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
wisconsin
supreme
court,
there
was
authority,
and
all
cases
prior
to
that
time
in
wisconsin
which
indicated
that,
in
fact,
the
court
would
not
review
a
finding
of
a
legislature.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
no,
the
trial
for
impeachment,
i
do
not
see
any
difficult--
mr.
william
m.
coffey
but
the
people
are
there
taking
part,
and
they
were
having
a
trial.
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
the
contours
of
the
legislative
body
make
it
difficult
to
perceive
a
heavy
uniform
perception
and
evaluation
of
conduct
that
it
is
going
on
in
that
large
an
area.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
no,
i
would
not
clearly
believe
that
a
trial
could
be
conducted.
i
would
hate
to
see
that
portion
under
the
legislative
machinery
and
that
obviously
it
would
cause
a
great
disruption
of
the
normal
legislative
process.
if
they
would
have
a
full
blown
trial,
but
i
clearly
think
the
chamber
with
the
special
place
to
have
the
trial.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
or
to
--
yes
they
could
bring
charges
under
the
ordinary
criminal
code,
unlawful
assembly
and
all
other
sorts
of
criminal
offenses,
but
additionally
i
believe
that
they
could
certify
one
as
the
federal
government
us
attorney
for
contempt
or
they
could
in
fact
have
a
hearing.
they
could
have
in
fact
had
a
hearing
in
district
court.
all
the
district
court
said
that
was
constitutionally
mandated
was
a
minimal
opportunity
to
appear
in
the
response,
in
all
of
the
cases
cited
in
the
respondent's
brief
of
a
legislative
contempt.
that
is
in
fact
the
procedure
that
was
followed.
the
contemnor
was
just
brought
in
before
the
bar
of
the
house
or
the
senate
and
advised
that
the
house
or
the
legislative
body
viewed
certain
of
his
conduct
as
contemptuous.
what
if
anything
did
he
have
to
say
as
to
why
he
should
not
be
held
in
contempt?
and,
that
is
what
the
district
court
said
was
constitutionally
mandated.
the
district
court
did
not
conceive
a
full
blown
trial.
i
feel
that
the
petitioner
is
entitled
to
that
at
a
minimum
and
that
he
may
well
be
entitled
to
more
procedural
due
process
than
just
that
minimum
or
minimal
due
process.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
yes.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
mr.
justice
blackmun
in
terms
of
mootness,
the
resolution
in
addition
to
holding
the
petitioner
in
contempt,
there
was
also
a
second
part
of
the
resolution
which
under
pursuant
to
the
section
1327
of
the
statutes
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
referred
the
matter
to
the
district
attorney
of
dane
county.
section
1327,
that
the
statute
to
the
state
of
wisconsin
sub-paragraph
2,
provides
that
any
person
who
is
adjudged
guilty.
i
am
sorry
this
on
page
24
(a)
of
the
petition
for
a
petition
for
writ.
i
am
sorry
it
is
not
in
the
appendix.
the
statute
provides
that
any
person
that
is
adjudged
guilty
of
any
contempt
of
the
legislature
or
either
house
thereof
shall
be
deemed
guilty
also
by
misdemeanor
and
after
the
adjournment
of
such
a
legislature
maybe
prosecuted
therefore
in
dane
county
and
maybe
fined
not
more
than
$200.00
or
imprisoned
not
more
than
one
year
in
the
county
jail.
the
legislative
assembly
that
held
the
petitioner
in
contempt
adjourned
sini
die
on
either
january
6th
or
january
7th
of
1971.
the
prosecution
contemplated
by
the
resolution
of
the
assembly
has
not
been
to
this
date
commenced,
but
there
is
the
thread
of
this
prosecution.
i
would
indicate
that
i
think
in
terms
of
collateral
estoppel
or
double
jeopardy,
there
maybe
some
defenses
to
that
prosecution,
but
there
is
the
thread
of
that
prosecution
which
i
believe
would
bring
this
matter
under
the
doctrine
of
this
court
in
sibron
versus
new
york
and
carafas
v.
lavallee,
and
i
would
suggest
that
the
matter
is
not
moot.
thank
you.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
mr.
chief
justice,
the
inquiry,
the
respondent
has
preceded
that
the
summary
contempt
power
is
very
great
power
subject
to
abuse.
in
the
instance
case,
there
is
no
way
that
the
petitioner
has
ever
been
able
to
get
a
review,
the
factual
basis
on
which
the
legislature
asked.
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
in
denying
the
petition
to
writ
habeas
corpus
suggested
that
some
type
of
judicial
review
was
available.
we
filed
a
motion
of
petition
for
rehearing
in
the
wisconsin
supreme
court,
and
requested
--
indicated
that
their
opinion
indicated
such
a
judicial
review
was
available.
all
of
the
authority
that
we
had
found
indicated
to
contrary,
would
the
court
please
advise
the
petitioner,
what
kind
of
hearing
was
available
to
him
and
grant
him
that
hearing,
but
even
assuming
that
he
could
have
gotten
the
hearing
at
that
time,
i
think
we
must
recognize
that
hearing
comes
too
late.
the
petitioner
was
already
in
jail
pursuant
to
the
contempt
resolution
and
at
that
point
he
had
been
denied
bail
and
i
do
not
believe
that
he
should
have
his
right
to
a
hearing
on
the
factual
basis
of
the
contempt
after
he
is
already
in
jail.
i
think,
the
hearing
should
precede
the
right
of
anyone
to
place
him
in
custody.
i
suggest
that
as
the
district
court
held
that
at
a
very
minimum,
the
petitioner
was
entitled
to
be
given
notice
of
the
charges
against
him
and
be
given
an
opportunity
to
respond
to
them.
thank
you.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
i
would
suggest
mr.
chief
justice
that
it
has
to
be
available
on
both
or
there
would
be
no
basis
on
which
to
check
the
arbitrary
exercised
power
by
the
legislature.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
i
think
that
is
essential
mr.
chief
justice.
or
there
is
no
check
on
completely
arbitrary
incarceration
of
people
that
these
please
the
legislative
body
and
there
has
to
be
a
check
on
that
kind
of
party.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
the
wisconsin
–
mr.
william
m.
coffey
they
did
suggest
that
which
is
contrary
as
the
district
court
opinion
noted
was
contrary
to
the
existing
case,
warned
wisconsin
at
the
time
and
when
the
petitioner
asked
for
that
hearing
the
motion
for
rehearing
was
denied
without
hearing
and
without
comment.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
yes
it
is
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
either
that
or
an
overruling
of
other
authority
without
expressly
doing.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
no.
