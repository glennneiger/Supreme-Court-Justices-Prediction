unknown
speaker
back
to
your
second
point.
i
noticed
in
the
opinion,
the
per
curiam
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin.
getting
on
109
(a)
of
the
appendix
and
the
chapter
begins
on
113
(a)
of
the
appendix.
the
supreme
court
seems
to
reciting
the
fact
--
reciting
a
fairly
detail
statement
of
facts.
where
did
that
come
from?
unknown
speaker
oh,
that
is
what
i
was
attempting
to
say,
i
just
want
to
hear
where
the
statement
and
facts
came
from
--
unknown
speaker
is
that
indicated
anywhere?
is
that
the
source
of
it?
unknown
speaker
they
do
say
we
take
judicial
notice
and
then
they
go
on
with
a
fairly
detailed
statement
of
what
happened
in
the
state
legislature.
unknown
speaker
is
their
any
substantial
claim
that
the
petitioner
did
not
know
with
what
he
was
being
charged
or
that
these
facts
are
inaccurate
in
any
way?
unknown
speaker
because
your
point
is,
i
suppose
that
he
was
not
given
any
opportunity
to
make
any
such
contention.
unknown
speaker
well
13.27
requires
a
prior
resolution
to
the
convicting
and
contempt
with
the
legislature?
unknown
speaker
for
this
case
it
was
–
unknown
speaker
is
the
facts
limitations
applicable
to
that
1327
type?
unknown
speaker
but
certainly
there
would
be
extremely
almost
insurmountable
double
jeopardy
problems
too?
unknown
speaker
well
if
that
so,
why
do
you
not
urge
this?
unknown
speaker
it
was
because
its
advantage
is
it
could
not
be
tried.
unknown
speaker
new
argument
on
that
ground.
unknown
speaker
in
other
word
you
are
not
arguing
would
--?
unknown
speaker
this
is
why
i
raised
the
question
with
mr.
coffey
a
little
while
ago.
i
want
to
be
sure
about
your
position.
you
are
not
arguing
this?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
is
an
indication
in
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
based
on
judicial
notice
that
the
legislature
could
not
act
that
day.
there
was
so
much
disruption.
unknown
speaker
was
it
two
days,
september
29th
and
october
1st
over
a
weekend?
unknown
speaker
so
it
was
right
at
the
start
of
session?
unknown
speaker
would
wisconsin's
position
be
the
same
if
a
lapse
of
time
instead
of
two
day,
it
is
two
months?
unknown
speaker
why
would
it
be
weaker
on
the
issue
at
the
appendix?
unknown
speaker
i
did
not
understand
what
wisconsin's
position
was
instead
of
--
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
understand
why
if
you
do
not
have
to
explain
this
two
days,
you
would
have
explain
it
two
months.
unknown
speaker
is
that
not
what
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
said
is
available,
on
page
23
(a)
of
the
appendix?
unknown
speaker
the
wisconsin
seems
to
say
that
is
what
is
available
and
that
the
review
of
procedure
is
not
available,
and
as
the
only
issues
presented
that
dealt
primarily
with
procedure,
not
with
issue
of
his
innocence
or
with
the
merits
of
any
defense
implying
that
had
they
have
you
presented
problems
on
the
merits,
they
would
review
it.
