mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
sverre
o.
tinglum,
assistant
attorney
general
from
wisconsin.
i
am
representing
the
respondent
here
today.
respondent
sees
the
issue
before
this
court
as
an
extremely
narrow
issue
and
that
issue
is
whether
legislative
body
as
a
state
legislature,
house
of
the
state
legislature
or
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
whether,
any
such
legislative
body
may
exercise
its
contempt
power
in
a
summary
fashion,
that
is
in
the
same
manner
as
the
courts
exercised
their
contempt
powers
where
there
has
been
contemptuous
conduct
in
the
immediate
presence
of
the
court
tending
to
obstruct
the
court's
proceedings.
question
is
whether
the
legislature
in
the
case
of
a
direct
contempt
as
contrasted
with
a
constructive
contempt.
whether
it
may
in
a
words
of
the
terry
case
cited
in
our
brief
proceed
upon
its
own
knowledge
of
the
facts
and
punish
the
offender
without
further
proof
and
without
issue
or
trial
in
any
form.
the
district
judge
who
first
considered
these
issues
acknowledged
that
the
conduct
described
in
the
assembly’s
resolution,
if
it
had
been
committed
in
open
court
would
justify
summary
contempt
procedure
in
court.
and
then
the
district
judge
said
“alright,
now
he
have
to
look
to
see
if
the
legislature
has
the
same
power
to
proceed
summarily
as
any
court
would”.
the
district
judge
held
that
the
legislature
did
not
have
such
a
power.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
held
that
it
did
reversing
the
district
judge.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
am
not
sure,
i
understand
--
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
oh!
i
am
sorry.
i
understand
your
question
now
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
this
was
--
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
there
are
a
hundred.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
there
is
a
presumption
of
a
regularity
of
the
legislative
proceedings.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
that
there
were
sufficient
numbers
there
and
that
those
who
voted
witnessed
the
content,
the
condemnations
conduct.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
this
is
a
presumption
that
has
been
acknowledged
by
this
court.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
have
no
idea.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
only
if
the
question
had
been
raised
as
a
factual
a
question
in
this
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
the
district
court
made
an
assumption
that
that
was
a
question
of
fact
and
he
decided
that
question
of
fact
against
the
respondent.
and
as
a
part
of
our
appeal
to
the
seventh
circuit
we
pointed
to
the
after
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
do
not
think
that
assumption
can
be
made.
that
would
be
presuming
an
irregularity
in
legislative
procedure.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
no.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
no.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
all
i
am
saying
is
that
there
is
presumption
of
regularity
of
legislative
proceedings.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
yes
sir.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
think
until
the
question
is
raised.
it
must
be
presumed.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
raised
by
the
--
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
yes,
sir.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
no.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
think
there
is
such
a
presumption
and
i
think
there
is
a
further
presumption
that
has
been
acknowledged
by
this
court
as
a
presumption
of
the
regularity
of
proceedings.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
which
would
include
--
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
majority.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
that
is
possible.
this
is
as
we
pointed
out
to
a
court
appeals
was
a
“not
a
non-issue
of
fact,”
that
the
district
court
assumed
to
determine
without
giving
the
state
an
opportunity
to
prove
in
an
evidentiary
hearing,
that
in
fact
the
legislators
who
did
vote
for
the
contempt
resolution
were
in
fact
present
on
the
day
that
the
contempt
took
place
and
were
in
fact
those
who
voted
for
the
contempt
resolution?
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
do
not
understand
that
to
be
petitioner's
argument
that
maybe
what
he
is
driving
at--
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
interpreted
petitioner’s
argument
to
be
that
the
resolution
failed
to
state
sufficient
probable
cause
as
this
court
has
interpreted
probable
cause
and
this
appears
in
judge
kiley
(ph)
dissent
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
have
never—
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
have
never
understood
that
to
be
petitioner’s
argument.
there
was
no
such
an
allegation
in
the
original
petition
in
the
district
court.
this
sort
of
recitation
of
fact
as
to
who
voted
and
who
saw
has
never
appeared
to
my
knowledge
in
any
resolution
of
contempt
passed
by
any
legislative
body
at
anytime
and
it
has
never
been
required
by
any
court
at
anytime.
this
i
see
as
a
non
issue
i
take
it
to
be
conceded.
i
believe
it
to
be
conceded
by
the
petitioner
that
a
legislative
body
such
as
state
house
of
the
state
legislature
has
the
power
to
punish.
it
is
house
having
authority
to
commit
for
contempt.
for
example,
precedent
for
that
is
the
cases
cited
in
both
briefs,
i
take
it
to
be
a
non
issue
that
there
have
been
very
grave
and
serious
abuses
of
the
parliamentary
powers
of
contempt
in
past.
the
amicus
brief
dwells
at
some
length
on
this
and
i
am
certain
that
if
there
had
been
search
made
even
more
grievous
abuses
could
have
been
cited
than
were
cited
in
the
briefs.
however
i
do
not
see
that
as
an
issue
in
this
case
because
what
is
happened
in
the
past,
this
court
has
said
that
simple
abuses
of
the
power
are
no
reason
for
denying
its
existence.
another
thing
that
is
conceded
and
is
not
at
issue
in
this
case,
is
that
the
contempt
power
and
particularly
the
summary
contempt
power
is
an
extremely
delicate
power
to
be
used
sparingly
as
this
court
has
said
and
is
to
be
exercised
with
the
greatest
sense
of
responsibility,
this
is
conceded.
there
is
an
other
non
issue
in
this
case
and
that
is
the
constitutionality
of
wisconsin’s
legislative
contempt
statute.
that
is
the
statute
that
was
referred
to
by
counsel,
section
1326.
the
issue
of
the
constitutionality
of
that
statute
was
litigated
in
a
companion
case
to
this
one.
the
freylik
case
and
their
a
three
judge
district
court
ruled
that
the
statute
constitutional
that
it
was
not
big
over
broad,
that
it
did
not
call
for
involuntary
servitude
and
other
issues.
there
was
no
appeal
from
that
decision
by
the
three
judge
district
court.
this
case
incidentally
is
a
spin
off
from
that
case.
this
case
started
as
the
federal
civil
rights
action
for
declaratory
judgment
and
then
when
the
federal
district
judge
ruled
that
the
portion
of
that
action,
the
request
for
an
injunction
actually
was
a
request
for
habeas
corpus
relief
then
this
case
groppi
versus
leslie
became
a
spin
off
of
groppi
versus
frelly
and
proceeded
as
a
habeas
case.
it
is
also
conceded
and
i
see
it
to
be
a
non
issue
in
this
case
that
a
legislative
body
has
other
courses,
it
may
fallow
in
the
event
of
a
direct
disorderly
contempt
of
its
proceedings.
it
may
refer
the
matter
to
the
courts.
in
the
watkins
case,
this
court
observed
that
congress
has
rarely
exercised
its
contempt
powers
but
had
preferred
at
that
time
to
refer
matters
of
contempt
to
the
united
state
attorney
for
prosecution.
there
is
no
issue
about
this.
the
legislative
--
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
yes,
it
had.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
yes,
13
that
is
what
i
am
referring
to.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
yes,
i
am
sorry
mr.
justice
brennan.
what
i
was
think
of
was
the
disorderly
conduct
statute.
yes,
disorderly
conduct
occurring
anywhere
within
the
state
maybe
prosecuted
and
the
legislative
--
the
assembly
could
have
treated
this
simply
as
a
case
of
disorderly
conduct.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
yes,
under
general
statute.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
yes.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
it
is,
and
what
i
should
say
is
wisconsin
has
no
parallel
to
that
statute.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
no.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
that
the
arrest
was
made,
as
i
remember
was
made
at
the
later
time.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
on
the
assembly
floor.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
yes,
the
same
conduct.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
am
sorry.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
exactly
the
same.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
that
is
correct.
i
am
sorry,
i
did
not
intent
to
mislead.
it
is
exactly
the
same
conduct
that
was
tried
in
the
disorderly
conduct
case
under
the
general
statute.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
that
is
correct.
he
was
never
convicted
of
disorderly
conduct
in
the
court.
there
as
mr.
chief
justice
burger
point
it
out
there
never
was
a
--
there
was
a
mistrial
and
never
any
new
trial.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
conceivably
there
could
be
a
charge
under
section
13.27
of
the
statutes.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
it
was
dismissed.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
yes,
sir.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
the
state
has
never
contented
that
it
is
moot.
i
would
feel
that
as
long
as
the
possibility
exists,
that
someone
could
prefer
charges
under
section
1327.
i
would
feel
that
under
grafus
versus
low
valley
that
the
there
was
sufficient
interest
left
here
in
the
petitioner
and
a
sufficient
hazard
involved
at
least
theoretically.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
know
of
none.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
absolutely.
that
is
my
opinion.
it
is
not
an
issue
here
but
that
would
be
my
opinion.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
that
is
correct.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
as
i
understand
carafas
versus
lavallee
and
the
principles
in
that
case,
if
there
is
a
theoretical
possibility
that
a
previous
judgment
if
allowed
to
stand
could
work
to
someone’s
disadvantage
in
the
future,
then
the
issue
is
not
moot.
so
we
certainly
have
not
urged.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
but
that
issue
is
not
before
the
court
at
this
time
and
all
i
can
say
is
that
in
my
personal
opinion,
yes.
there
would
be
–-
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
do
not
believe
under
the
cases
that
have
been
decided
by
this
court
that
i
cannot
argue
on
--
i
am
not
urging
that.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
am
not.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
that
is
correct.
it
is
also
a
non
issue
in
this
case
that
the
assembly
could
have
taken
different
courses
of
action
as
congress
has
the
power
to
take
different
courses
of
action
in
contempt
cases.
the
question
before
this
court
is
whether
the
constitution
requires
that
the
legislative
body
must
take
some
different
course
of
action.
whether
it
must
refrain
and
ignore
the
contempt
altogether
or
whether
it
must
rely
on
general
criminal
statutes
or
whether
it
must
somehow
refer
the
matter
to
the
executive
and
rely
upon
the
executive
or
upon
the
judiciary
to
vindicate
its
authority.
it
is
also
a
non
issue
in
this
case
that
if
this
had
been
a
case
of
indirect
or
constructive
contempt,
obviously
the
procedure
followed
by
the
assembly
would
have
been
invalid.
good
many
of
the
case
cited
in
both
of
the
briefs,
in
petitioner's
brief
or
respondent's
brief
refer
to
cases
of
indirect
constructive
contempt
where
the
legislative
bodies
have
brought
the
contemnor
before
the
bar
of
the
house
or
of
the
senate
and
there
have
heard
evidence
of
what
occurred
outside
the
legislative
(inaudible).
these
are
constructive
contempt
cases.
this
is
not,
this
is
direct
contempt
case
involving
the
disorderly
conduct.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
none.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
yes.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
that
appears
in
the
record.
there
has
been
no
evidentiary
hearing
so
that
it
has
not
been
developed
in
that
fashion.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
would
have
to
go
outside
the
record
to
tell
you
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
nothing.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
there
is
--
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
the
debate
that
is
not
recited
in
the
resolution.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
september
29th
was
a
monday,
that
was
the
day
on
which
the
legislature
was
to
convene
in
special
session.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
it
was
right
at
the
start
of
the
session.
as
a
matter
fact,
i
cannot
say
that
it
was
at
the
start
of
the
session
because
the
session
did
not
start
on
the
day
that
it
was
to
have
started.
i
have
talked
about
the
none
issues
and
the
issue
as
i
see
it
again
is
a
very
narrow
one.
does
the
constitution
command
that
a
legislative
body
exercise
its
contempt
power
different
from
the
manner
in
which
a
court
is
entitled
to
exercise
the
same
power.
there
are
no
cases
in
point,
at
least
neither
of
the
parties
to
this
action
have
been
able
to
find
a
case
precisely
in
point.
most
cases
discussing
legislative
contempt
incidents
of
the
legislative
contempt
are
cases
of
constructive
or
indirect
contempt.
whereas
as
i
said
previously
the
contemnor
is
brought
before
the
bar
because
the
house
has
not
seen
the
conduct
with
its
own
eyes.
in
some
of
the
precedents,
some
of
the
cases
discussing
legislative
contempts,
it
is
apparent
that
a
summary
procedure
was
in
fact
followed
but
there
has
never
been
any
discussion
of
that
in
any
of
the
cases
that
have
a
reason.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
think
yes.
wisconsin’s
case
would
be
much
weaker.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
because
without
anything
in
the
record
to
explain
the
delay.
i
think
there
would
be,
it
would
just
be
that
much
more
difficult
to
explain
a
delay
of
that
magnitude.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
we
do
not
--
not
as
far
as
the
two
days
are
concerned.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
believe
in
the
first
place
that
there
have
been
instances,
decisions
by
this
court,
for
example
in
the
terry
case,
ex
parte
terry,
in
re
morrey
(ph)
which
is
a
second
circuit
case,
that
there
have
been
delays
unexplained
in
the
record.
and
this
court
has
said
that
short
delays
do
not
have
to
be
explained.
for
example,
in
the
terry
case
i
believe
there
was
delay
of
one
day.
the
disorderly
conduct
occurred
in
open
court
on
one
day
and
the
contempt
citation
did
not
come
out
for
the
next
day.
court
said
this
delay
is
frivolous.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
well,
if
you
delay
to
that
extent.
that
would
seem
to
undermine
the
assembly’s
position
that
it
needed
protection.
that
it
had
the
authority
to
remove
this
source
of
disturbance.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
yes.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
it
is
not.
there
is
self
reservation
and
there
is
what
has
been
called
by
the
courts
of
indication
of
the
body’s
authority--
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
think
the
juror
has
never
been
mentioned
in
any
case
that
i
have
seen
but
i
think
as
matter
of
logic
and
common
sense,
yes
deterrence
plays
very
large
part
in
this.
there
was
a
case,
where
the
united
state
senate
proceeded
summarily
and
ex
parte
nugent
cited
in
the
respondent's
brief
where
the
debate
and
the
deliberations
leading
up
to
the
contempt
resolution
and
the
contempt
resolution
itself
were
conducted
in
secret.
there
again,
and
the
circuit
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
at
that
time
held
that
this
was
a
proper
procedure
but
the
precise
point
that
we
have
here,
that
is
whether
or
not
the
legislature
has
any
less
power
than
the
courts
around
the
nation
to
proceed
in
a
proper
case
in
summary
fashion
has
never
been
expressly
discussed
and
decided
by
any
court.
the
closest
decision
that
i
know
that
it
comes
to
it
is
marshall
versus
gordon.
there,
there
is
some
dictum
that
suggests
that
the
power
--
that
the
courts
have
to
exercise
summary
contempt
powers
proceeds
from
the
same
source
and
that
both
the
legislators
and
the
courts
have
identical
summary
contempt
powers.
the
district
judge
said
“alright
there
are
no
cases,
there
is
nothing
to
guide
this
court,
i
am
going
to
look
to
see
if
there
are
any
reasons
in
logic
or
in
the
factual
circumstances
of
the
two
bodies”
that
is
the
court
and
legislature
to
warrant
a
different
treatment
before
the
law.
and
the
district
judge
said,”
well,
there
are
so
many
people
observing
disorderly
conduct
in
the
legislative
chamber,
that
you
can
have
a
good
deal
of
confusion
as
to
just
what
took
place
whereas
in
the
court,
you
have
only
one
judge
looking
and
it
is
easier
if
you
would
not
have
that
confusion”.
the
district
judge
said
also,
there
is
a
second
point,
that
there
is
no
transcript
of
the
proceeding
in
a
legislative
chamber
whereas
there
is
in
court.
and
on
those
two
points,
the
district
court
held
that
the
legislature
did
not
have
summary
contempt
powers.
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
disagreed
and
i
think
rightly
so
because
if
it
is
true
that
one
pair
of
eyes
is
better
than
several
pairs
of
eyes,
then
of
course
one
juror
better
than
many
jurors.
appellate
courts,
for
example,
would
not
be
able
to
observe
properly,
according
to
the
district
judge's
theory,
would
not
be
able
to
observe
a
direct
contempt.
the
differences
that
are
pointed
out
in
the
respondent's
brief
between
courts
and
legislatures
are
such
that
the
legislature
should
have
summary
contempt
powers
at
least
equal
to
those
possessed
by
the
courts,
because
there
are
probably
upward
to
5000
judges
in
this
country
who
posses
summary
contempt
powers.
there
are
only
50
legislatures.
when
you
stop
a
legislature,
there
is
no
other
body
that
can
pick
up
the
ball
and
run
with
it
and
do
the
work
of
that
that
legislature.
it
stops.
and
a
continual
week
by
week
disturbance
in
the
legislature
would
forever
stop
that
legislature.
further
more,
a
legislative
body
when
it
is
proceeding
to
act
upon
a
contempt,
acts
publicly.
there
is
publicity,
there
is
deliberation.
usually,
in
the
two
party
political
system
you
can
expect
debate
before
action
is
taken.
there
are
certainly
similarities
between
legislatures
and
courts
that
again
call
for
similar
treatment,
similar
powers
of
self
reservation.
they
have
been
cited.
cases
have
been
cited
going
back
to
parliamentary
times
in
england,
colonial
times
in
this
country.
anderson
versus
dunn,
up
to
marshall
versus
gordon,
jurney
v.
maccracken,
where
this
court
has
said
the
legislature
is
just
as
vulnerable
as
any
court
to
attack
in
disruption.
it
has
also
been
acknowledged
by
this
court
many
times
that
it
is
essential
to
preserve
the
independence
of
the
legislative
body
and
you
cannot
force
the
legislature
to
rely
upon
the
--
sometimes
hostile
judiciary
or
an
unfriendly
executive
taking
those
words
from
united
states
versus
johnson.
there
is
certainly
a
need
on
the
part
of
legislature
as
great
as
in
the
courts
to
continue
functioning
and
to
continue
the
dialog
that
takes
place
in
a
legislature.
there
are
no
differences
that
warrant
a
denial
of
this
power
to
legislature
and
the
similarities
between
the
two
forums,
to
call
for
and
demonstrate
that
both
bodies
must
have
equal
powers
to
protect
themselves
from
attack.
the
contempt
power
is
certainly
very
–
it
is
a
radical
power,
it
is
drastic,
it
is
subject
to
great
abuse
and
it
is
very
properly
limited
and
back
in
1848,
the
wisconsin
legislature
did
very
severely
limit
the
contempt
power
of
the
houses
of
legislature.
it
described
a
very-very
narrow
area
in
which
the
legislature
could
act
upon
a
direct
contempt.
only
where
there
has
been
disorderly
conduct
on
the
floor
of
the
house,
in
the
immediate
view
of
the
house
in
which
directly
tends
to
disrupt,
can
the
legislature
act
summarily.
thank
you.
mr.

mr.

may
it
please
the

attorney
general
from
wisconsin.
i
am
representing
the
respondent
here
today.
respondent
sees
the
issue
before
this
court
as
an
extremely
narrow
issue
and
that
issue
is
whether
legislative
body
as
a
state
legislature,
house
of
the
state
legislature
or
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
whether,
any
such
legislative
body
may
exercise
its
contempt
power
in
a
summary
fashion,
that
is
in
the
same
manner
as
the
courts
exercised
their
contempt
powers
where
there
has
been
contemptuous
conduct
in
the
immediate
presence
of
the
court
tending
to
obstruct
the
court's
proceedings.
question
is
whether
the
legislature
in
the
case
of
a
direct
contempt
as
contrasted
with
a
constructive
contempt.
whether
it
may
in
a
words
of
the
terry
case
cited
in
our
brief
proceed
upon
its
own
knowledge
of
the
facts
and
punish
the
offender
without
further
proof
and
without
issue
or
trial
in
any
form.
the
district
judge
who
first
considered
these
issues
acknowledged
that
the
conduct
described
in
the
assembly’s
resolution,
if
it
had
been
committed
in
open
court
would
justify
summary
contempt
procedure
in
court.
and
then
the
district
judge
said
“alright,
now
he
have
to
look
to
see
if
the
legislature
has
the
same
power
to
proceed
summarily
as
any
court
would”.
the
district
judge
held
that
the
legislature
did
not
have
such
a
power.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
held
that
it
did
reversing
the
district
judge.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
am
not
sure,
i
understand
--
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
oh!
i
am
sorry.
i
understand
your
question
now
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
this
was
--
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
there
are
a
hundred.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
there
is
a
presumption
of
a
regularity
of
the
legislative
proceedings.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
that
there
were
sufficient
numbers
there
and
that
those
who
voted
witnessed
the
content,
the
condemnations
conduct.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
this
is
a
presumption
that
has
been
acknowledged
by
this
court.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
have
no
idea.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
only
if
the
question
had
been
raised
as
a
factual
a
question
in
this
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
the
district
court
made
an
assumption
that
that
was
a
question
of
fact
and
he
decided
that
question
of
fact
against
the
respondent.
and
as
a
part
of
our
appeal
to
the
seventh
circuit
we
pointed
to
the
after
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
do
not
think
that
assumption
can
be
made.
that
would
be
presuming
an
irregularity
in
legislative
procedure.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
no.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
no.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
all
i
am
saying
is
that
there
is
presumption
of
regularity
of
legislative
proceedings.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
yes
sir.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
think
until
the
question
is
raised.
it
must
be
presumed.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
raised
by
the
--
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
yes,
sir.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
no.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
think
there
is
such
a
presumption
and
i
think
there
is
a
further
presumption
that
has
been
acknowledged
by
this
court
as
a
presumption
of
the
regularity
of
proceedings.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
which
would
include
--
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
majority.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
that
is
possible.
this
is
as
we
pointed
out
to
a
court
appeals
was
a
“not
a
non-issue
of
fact,”
that
the
district
court
assumed
to
determine
without
giving
the
state
an
opportunity
to
prove
in
an
evidentiary
hearing,
that
in
fact
the
legislators
who
did
vote
for
the
contempt
resolution
were
in
fact
present
on
the
day
that
the
contempt
took
place
and
were
in
fact
those
who
voted
for
the
contempt
resolution?
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
do
not
understand
that
to
be
petitioner's
argument
that
maybe
what
he
is
driving
at--
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
interpreted
petitioner’s
argument
to
be
that
the
resolution
failed
to
state
sufficient
probable
cause
as
this
court
has
interpreted
probable
cause
and
this
appears
in
judge
kiley
(ph)
dissent
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
have
never—
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
have
never
understood
that
to
be
petitioner’s
argument.
there
was
no
such
an
allegation
in
the
original
petition
in
the
district
court.
this
sort
of
recitation
of
fact
as
to
who
voted
and
who
saw
has
never
appeared
to
my
knowledge
in
any
resolution
of
contempt
passed
by
any
legislative
body
at
anytime
and
it
has
never
been
required
by
any
court
at
anytime.
this
i
see
as
a
non
issue
i
take
it
to
be
conceded.
i
believe
it
to
be
conceded
by
the
petitioner
that
a
legislative
body
such
as
state
house
of
the
state
legislature
has
the
power
to
punish.
it
is
house
having
authority
to
commit
for
contempt.
for
example,
precedent
for
that
is
the
cases
cited
in
both
briefs,
i
take
it
to
be
a
non
issue
that
there
have
been
very
grave
and
serious
abuses
of
the
parliamentary
powers
of
contempt
in
past.
the
amicus
brief
dwells
at
some
length
on
this
and
i
am
certain
that
if
there
had
been
search
made
even
more
grievous
abuses
could
have
been
cited
than
were
cited
in
the
briefs.
however
i
do
not
see
that
as
an
issue
in
this
case
because
what
is
happened
in
the
past,
this
court
has
said
that
simple
abuses
of
the
power
are
no
reason
for
denying
its
existence.
another
thing
that
is
conceded
and
is
not
at
issue
in
this
case,
is
that
the
contempt
power
and
particularly
the
summary
contempt
power
is
an
extremely
delicate
power
to
be
used
sparingly
as
this
court
has
said
and
is
to
be
exercised
with
the
greatest
sense
of
responsibility,
this
is
conceded.
there
is
an
other
non
issue
in
this
case
and
that
is
the
constitutionality
of
wisconsin’s
legislative
contempt
statute.
that
is
the
statute
that
was
referred
to
by
counsel,
section
1326.
the
issue
of
the
constitutionality
of
that
statute
was
litigated
in
a
companion
case
to
this
one.
the
freylik
case
and
their
a
three
judge
district
court
ruled
that
the
statute
constitutional
that
it
was
not
big
over
broad,
that
it
did
not
call
for
involuntary
servitude
and
other
issues.
there
was
no
appeal
from
that
decision
by
the
three
judge
district
court.
this
case
incidentally
is
a
spin
off
from
that
case.
this
case
started
as
the
federal
civil
rights
action
for
declaratory
judgment
and
then
when
the
federal
district
judge
ruled
that
the
portion
of
that
action,
the
request
for
an
injunction
actually
was
a
request
for
habeas
corpus
relief
then
this
case
groppi
versus
leslie
became
a
spin
off
of
groppi
versus
frelly
and
proceeded
as
a
habeas
case.
it
is
also
conceded
and
i
see
it
to
be
a
non
issue
in
this
case
that
a
legislative
body
has
other
courses,
it
may
fallow
in
the
event
of
a
direct
disorderly
contempt
of
its
proceedings.
it
may
refer
the
matter
to
the
courts.
in
the
watkins
case,
this
court
observed
that
congress
has
rarely
exercised
its
contempt
powers
but
had
preferred
at
that
time
to
refer
matters
of
contempt
to
the
united
state
attorney
for
prosecution.
there
is
no
issue
about
this.
the
legislative
--
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
yes,
it
had.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
yes,
13
that
is
what
i
am
referring
to.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
yes,
i
am
sorry
mr.
justice
brennan.
what
i
was
think
of
was
the
disorderly
conduct
statute.
yes,
disorderly
conduct
occurring
anywhere
within
the
state
maybe
prosecuted
and
the
legislative
--
the
assembly
could
have
treated
this
simply
as
a
case
of
disorderly
conduct.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
yes,
under
general
statute.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
yes.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
it
is,
and
what
i
should
say
is
wisconsin
has
no
parallel
to
that
statute.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
no.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
that
the
arrest
was
made,
as
i
remember
was
made
at
the
later
time.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
on
the
assembly
floor.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
yes,
the
same
conduct.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
am
sorry.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
exactly
the
same.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
that
is
correct.
i
am
sorry,
i
did
not
intent
to
mislead.
it
is
exactly
the
same
conduct
that
was
tried
in
the
disorderly
conduct
case
under
the
general
statute.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
that
is
correct.
he
was
never
convicted
of
disorderly
conduct
in
the
court.
there
as
mr.
chief
justice
burger
point
it
out
there
never
was
a
--
there
was
a
mistrial
and
never
any
new
trial.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
conceivably
there
could
be
a
charge
under
section
13.27
of
the
statutes.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
it
was
dismissed.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
yes,
sir.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
the
state
has
never
contented
that
it
is
moot.
i
would
feel
that
as
long
as
the
possibility
exists,
that
someone
could
prefer
charges
under
section
1327.
i
would
feel
that
under
grafus
versus
low
valley
that
the
there
was
sufficient
interest
left
here
in
the
petitioner
and
a
sufficient
hazard
involved
at
least
theoretically.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
know
of
none.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
absolutely.
that
is
my
opinion.
it
is
not
an
issue
here
but
that
would
be
my
opinion.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
that
is
correct.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
as
i
understand
carafas
versus
lavallee
and
the
principles
in
that
case,
if
there
is
a
theoretical
possibility
that
a
previous
judgment
if
allowed
to
stand
could
work
to
someone’s
disadvantage
in
the
future,
then
the
issue
is
not
moot.
so
we
certainly
have
not
urged.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
but
that
issue
is
not
before
the
court
at
this
time
and
all
i
can
say
is
that
in
my
personal
opinion,
yes.
there
would
be
–-
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
do
not
believe
under
the
cases
that
have
been
decided
by
this
court
that
i
cannot
argue
on
--
i
am
not
urging
that.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
am
not.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
that
is
correct.
it
is
also
a
non
issue
in
this
case
that
the
assembly
could
have
taken
different
courses
of
action
as
congress
has
the
power
to
take
different
courses
of
action
in
contempt
cases.
the
question
before
this
court
is
whether
the
constitution
requires
that
the
legislative
body
must
take
some
different
course
of
action.
whether
it
must
refrain
and
ignore
the
contempt
altogether
or
whether
it
must
rely
on
general
criminal
statutes
or
whether
it
must
somehow
refer
the
matter
to
the
executive
and
rely
upon
the
executive
or
upon
the
judiciary
to
vindicate
its
authority.
it
is
also
a
non
issue
in
this
case
that
if
this
had
been
a
case
of
indirect
or
constructive
contempt,
obviously
the
procedure
followed
by
the
assembly
would
have
been
invalid.
good
many
of
the
case
cited
in
both
of
the
briefs,
in
petitioner's
brief
or
respondent's
brief
refer
to
cases
of
indirect
constructive
contempt
where
the
legislative
bodies
have
brought
the
contemnor
before
the
bar
of
the
house
or
of
the
senate
and
there
have
heard
evidence
of
what
occurred
outside
the
legislative
(inaudible).
these
are
constructive
contempt
cases.
this
is
not,
this
is
direct
contempt
case
involving
the
disorderly
conduct.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
none.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
yes.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
that
appears
in
the
record.
there
has
been
no
evidentiary
hearing
so
that
it
has
not
been
developed
in
that
fashion.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
would
have
to
go
outside
the
record
to
tell
you
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
nothing.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
there
is
--
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
the
debate
that
is
not
recited
in
the
resolution.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
september
29th
was
a
monday,
that
was
the
day
on
which
the
legislature
was
to
convene
in
special
session.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
it
was
right
at
the
start
of
the
session.
as
a
matter
fact,
i
cannot
say
that
it
was
at
the
start
of
the
session
because
the
session
did
not
start
on
the
day
that
it
was
to
have
started.
i
have
talked
about
the
none
issues
and
the
issue
as
i
see
it
again
is
a
very
narrow
one.
does
the
constitution
command
that
a
legislative
body
exercise
its
contempt
power
different
from
the
manner
in
which
a
court
is
entitled
to
exercise
the
same
power.
there
are
no
cases
in
point,
at
least
neither
of
the
parties
to
this
action
have
been
able
to
find
a
case
precisely
in
point.
most
cases
discussing
legislative
contempt
incidents
of
the
legislative
contempt
are
cases
of
constructive
or
indirect
contempt.
whereas
as
i
said
previously
the
contemnor
is
brought
before
the
bar
because
the
house
has
not
seen
the
conduct
with
its
own
eyes.
in
some
of
the
precedents,
some
of
the
cases
discussing
legislative
contempts,
it
is
apparent
that
a
summary
procedure
was
in
fact
followed
but
there
has
never
been
any
discussion
of
that
in
any
of
the
cases
that
have
a
reason.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
think
yes.
wisconsin’s
case
would
be
much
weaker.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
because
without
anything
in
the
record
to
explain
the
delay.
i
think
there
would
be,
it
would
just
be
that
much
more
difficult
to
explain
a
delay
of
that
magnitude.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
we
do
not
--
not
as
far
as
the
two
days
are
concerned.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
believe
in
the
first
place
that
there
have
been
instances,
decisions
by
this
court,
for
example
in
the
terry
case,
ex
parte
terry,
in
re
morrey
(ph)
which
is
a
second
circuit
case,
that
there
have
been
delays
unexplained
in
the
record.
and
this
court
has
said
that
short
delays
do
not
have
to
be
explained.
for
example,
in
the
terry
case
i
believe
there
was
delay
of
one
day.
the
disorderly
conduct
occurred
in
open
court
on
one
day
and
the
contempt
citation
did
not
come
out
for
the
next
day.
court
said
this
delay
is
frivolous.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
well,
if
you
delay
to
that
extent.
that
would
seem
to
undermine
the
assembly’s
position
that
it
needed
protection.
that
it
had
the
authority
to
remove
this
source
of
disturbance.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
yes.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
it
is
not.
there
is
self
reservation
and
there
is
what
has
been
called
by
the
courts
of
indication
of
the
body’s
authority--
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
think
the
juror
has
never
been
mentioned
in
any
case
that
i
have
seen
but
i
think
as
matter
of
logic
and
common
sense,
yes
deterrence
plays
very
large
part
in
this.
there
was
a
case,
where
the
united
state
senate
proceeded
summarily
and
ex
parte
nugent
cited
in
the
respondent's
brief
where
the
debate
and
the
deliberations
leading
up
to
the
contempt
resolution
and
the
contempt
resolution
itself
were
conducted
in
secret.
there
again,
and
the
circuit
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
at
that
time
held
that
this
was
a
proper
procedure
but
the
precise
point
that
we
have
here,
that
is
whether
or
not
the
legislature
has
any
less
power
than
the
courts
around
the
nation
to
proceed
in
a
proper
case
in
summary
fashion
has
never
been
expressly
discussed
and
decided
by
any
court.
the
closest
decision
that
i
know
that
it
comes
to
it
is
marshall
versus
gordon.
there,
there
is
some
dictum
that
suggests
that
the
power
--
that
the
courts
have
to
exercise
summary
contempt
powers
proceeds
from
the
same
source
and
that
both
the
legislators
and
the
courts
have
identical
summary
contempt
powers.
the
district
judge
said
“alright
there
are
no
cases,
there
is
nothing
to
guide
this
court,
i
am
going
to
look
to
see
if
there
are
any
reasons
in
logic
or
in
the
factual
circumstances
of
the
two
bodies”
that
is
the
court
and
legislature
to
warrant
a
different
treatment
before
the
law.
and
the
district
judge
said,”
well,
there
are
so
many
people
observing
disorderly
conduct
in
the
legislative
chamber,
that
you
can
have
a
good
deal
of
confusion
as
to
just
what
took
place
whereas
in
the
court,
you
have
only
one
judge
looking
and
it
is
easier
if
you
would
not
have
that
confusion”.
the
district
judge
said
also,
there
is
a
second
point,
that
there
is
no
transcript
of
the
proceeding
in
a
legislative
chamber
whereas
there
is
in
court.
and
on
those
two
points,
the
district
court
held
that
the
legislature
did
not
have
summary
contempt
powers.
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
disagreed
and
i
think
rightly
so
because
if
it
is
true
that
one
pair
of
eyes
is
better
than
several
pairs
of
eyes,
then
of
course
one
juror
better
than
many
jurors.
appellate
courts,
for
example,
would
not
be
able
to
observe
properly,
according
to
the
district
judge's
theory,
would
not
be
able
to
observe
a
direct
contempt.
the
differences
that
are
pointed
out
in
the
respondent's
brief
between
courts
and
legislatures
are
such
that
the
legislature
should
have
summary
contempt
powers
at
least
equal
to
those
possessed
by
the
courts,
because
there
are
probably
upward
to
5000
judges
in
this
country
who
posses
summary
contempt
powers.
there
are
only
50
legislatures.
when
you
stop
a
legislature,
there
is
no
other
body
that
can
pick
up
the
ball
and
run
with
it
and
do
the
work
of
that
that
legislature.
it
stops.
and
a
continual
week
by
week
disturbance
in
the
legislature
would
forever
stop
that
legislature.
further
more,
a
legislative
body
when
it
is
proceeding
to
act
upon
a
contempt,
acts
publicly.
there
is
publicity,
there
is
deliberation.
usually,
in
the
two
party
political
system
you
can
expect
debate
before
action
is
taken.
there
are
certainly
similarities
between
legislatures
and
courts
that
again
call
for
similar
treatment,
similar
powers
of
self
reservation.
they
have
been
cited.
cases
have
been
cited
going
back
to
parliamentary
times
in
england,
colonial
times
in
this
country.
anderson
versus
dunn,
up
to
marshall
versus
gordon,
jurney
v.
maccracken,
where
this
court
has
said
the
legislature
is
just
as
vulnerable
as
any
court
to
attack
in
disruption.
it
has
also
been
acknowledged
by
this
court
many
times
that
it
is
essential
to
preserve
the
independence
of
the
legislative
body
and
you
cannot
force
the
legislature
to
rely
upon
the
--
sometimes
hostile
judiciary
or
an
unfriendly
executive
taking
those
words
from
united
states
versus
johnson.
there
is
certainly
a
need
on
the
part
of
legislature
as
great
as
in
the
courts
to
continue
functioning
and
to
continue
the
dialog
that
takes
place
in
a
legislature.
there
are
no
differences
that
warrant
a
denial
of
this
power
to
legislature
and
the
similarities
between
the
two
forums,
to
call
for
and
demonstrate
that
both
bodies
must
have
equal
powers
to
protect
themselves
from
attack.
the
contempt
power
is
certainly
very
–
it
is
a
radical
power,
it
is
drastic,
it
is
subject
to
great
abuse
and
it
is
very
properly
limited
and
back
in
1848,
the
wisconsin
legislature
did
very
severely
limit
the
contempt
power
of
the
houses
of
legislature.
it
described
a
very-very
narrow
area
in
which
the
legislature
could
act
upon
a
direct
contempt.
only
where
there
has
been
disorderly
conduct
on
the
floor
of
the
house,
in
the
immediate
view
of
the
house
in
which
directly
tends
to
disrupt,
can
the
legislature
act
summarily.
thank
you.
