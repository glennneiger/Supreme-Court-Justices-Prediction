justice

stewart
that
argument
seems
to
be
going
to
the
proposition
that
there
could
not
have
been
any
finding
of
contempt,
because
certainly
a
trial
by
biased
judge
is
deprivation
of
due
process
of
law
in
and
of
itself,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
you
are
not
making
that
ultimate
argument,
are
you?
justice
potter
stewart
it
could
not
be
before
a
different
legislature
very
well.
could
it
--
there
is
only
one
of
the
state
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
did
not
understand
your
argument
went
that
far,
at
least
from
reading
your
brief,
i
thought
that
your
argument
was
confined
to
the
proposition
that
there
had
to
be
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
respond.
secondly
that
the
charge
it
could
not
be
conclusary,
but
that
you
were
not
questioning
the
basic
right
of
legislature
to
find
your
client
in
contempt.
justice
potter
stewart
you
have
this
legislature
under
these
circumstances.
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
a
presumption
i
suppose
only
that
there
was
a
quarrel
on
each
day
or
something
of
that
kind.
justice
potter
stewart
well.
justice
potter
stewart
but
as
my
brother
marshall
says
that
the
presumption
of
regularity
certainly
does
not
embrace
the
presumption
that
every
single
one
of
the
100
legislators
within
a
hall
on
each
of
the
2
days
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
presumption
of
regularity.
what
it
is
quarrel
in
wisconsin?
justice
potter
stewart
so
51
could
have
been
there
on
one
day
and
51
the
next
day
and
this
means
that
of
the
two
days,
it
would
only
possibly
have
been
one
person
who
was
there
both
days.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
thought
the
whole
point
of
the
petitioner's
second
preposition
was
that
until
there
was
a
detailed
statement
of
what
the
alleged
content
consisted
of
that
people
voting
on
the
contempt
would
have
known
what
it
was
and
the
implication
of
that
is
that
there
were
not
there.
they
did
not
see
it
with
their
own
eyes
two
days
earlier.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
by
implication
what
his
argument
has
to
depend
upon?
justice
potter
stewart
it
sets
forth
mere
conclusion
and
fails
to
set
forth
any
underlying
facts
and
circumstances
which
constitute
the
alleged
contemptuous
behavior
and
i
assume
that
the
implication
of
that
whole
argument
is
that
there
where
people
who
voted
on
this
who
did
not
see
this
with
their
own
eyes.
otherwise
the
argument
does
not
--.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
that
point
did
raise
the
factual
issue.
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
just
under
a
charge
he
had
been
not
convict?
justice
potter
stewart
there
the
charge
still
hanging
over
him
now,
would
it?
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
a
mistrial
but
it
was
charge
ever
dismissed?
yes,
it
was
dismissed.
justice
potter
