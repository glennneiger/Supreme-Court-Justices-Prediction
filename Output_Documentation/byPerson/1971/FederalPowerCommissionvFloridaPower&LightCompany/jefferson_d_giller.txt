mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
first
i
would
like
to
answer
two
or
three
statements
made
by
the
fpc
with
respect
to
the
colton
case.
florida
power
light
company
used
the
tracing
used
in
the
colton
case.
the
fpc
used
a
different
method
as
in
this
present
situation
here,
we
fpl
use
the
colton
method
of
tracing.
please
do
not
confuse
the
terms
power
and
the
electric
energy,
they
are
not
synonymous.
this
is
a
play
on
words,
it
was
brought
in
the
record
before
the
examiners
and
i
will
get
into
that
in
a
little
more
detail
later
on.
the
electric
energy
never
reverses.
it
always
goes
from
generator
to
load.
your
house
bulb
does
not
supply
electric
energy
back
to
the
generator.
there
is
something
called
reactive
power
which
during
part
of
a
cycle
does
reverse
but
that
by
definition
is
not
energy.
and
the
commission
witnesses
be
very
careful
to
speak
about
power
and
not
about
electric
energy.
next,
getting
back
to
there
first
and
primary
basis,
cooperation
between
utilities
does
not
determine
jurisdiction,
interstate
transmission
does.
neither
does
clock
speed
determine
jurisdiction.
and
further,
we
have
we
been
unable
to
find
in
the
record
any
testimony
of
any
witness
that
the
cause
and
effect
theory
is
actual
transmission
of
electric
energy
in
interstate
commerce.
dr.
jessel
and
the
others
did
not
so
testify
that
we
can
find
or
what
we
look
for.
this
was
a
3:2
decision
by
the
commission
with
the
strong
dissent.
to
review
for
a
moment
the
jurisdictional
requirements,
a
statute
says,
jurisdiction
depends
upon
transmission
of
electric
energy
only
in
interstate
commerce
and
it
specifically
excludes
jurisdiction
over
facilities
used
for
the
transmission
electric
energy
only
in
intrastate
commerce.
the
statute
also
says
that
electric
energy
shall
be
held
to
be
transmitted
in
interstate
commerce
if
transmitted
from
a
state
and
consumed
at
any
point
outside
thereof.
the
commissions
positions
seems
to
be
that
it
should
not
be
subject
these
restrictions
or
it
may
take
astonishing
position
on
page
36
of
this
brief
right
in
the
middle
of
that
page
that
it
should
not
have
to
abstain
from
asserting
his
jurisdiction
“until
such
time
if
ever
as
it
can
be
proven
as
a
fact
in
common
law
terms
that
there
is
an
actual
transmission.”
we
say
there
is
tantamount
to
an
admission
that
they
have
not
been
able
to
prove
their
case.
and
it
is
a
good
reason
but
they
could
not
prove
because
the
facts
just
are
not
there.
since
we
are
talking
about
transmission
of
electric
energy,
i
plead
that
thermal
electric
energy
needs
to
be
known.
electric
energy
is
defined
by
the
commission
in
its
text,
by
others,
as
that
which
does
work
and
is
normally
measured
in
kilowatt
hours.
it
is
what
we
all
as
householders
pay
for
each
month,
when
we
pay
our
bill.
so
many
kilowatt
hours
of
electric
energy
measured
by
that
electric
meters
sitting
on
the
back
of
our
house.
we
believe
in
essential
to
understanding
of
this
case
that
certain
facts
concerning
undisputed
nature
of
an
electric
energy
be
understood.
i
realize
there
are
some
facts
that
are
not
agreed
upon
but
these
facts
at
least
are.
one
there
is
no
storage
or
pooling
of
electric
energy.
it
is
generated
and
consumed
instantly.
a
generator
never
puts
out
more
electric
energy
than
is
consumed.
the
load
tells
how
much
is
to
be
put
out.
for
example,
if
a
generator
is
running
at
full
speed,
there
is
no
load
on
it,
there
is
no
electric
energy
being
produced
by
that
generator.
next,
there
can
be
no
flow
of
electric
energy
in
opposite
directions
in
a
conduit
simultaneously.
they
all,
the
commission
fully
agrees.
third,
you
cannot
get
the
electric
energy
flow
from
a
generator
pass
the
first
load
that
is
bigger
than
the
generation
is.
that
load
is
insatiable
and
instantaneous,
it
gobbles
up
all
electric
energy
and
not
one
bit
gets
fastest
and
there
is
no
disagreement
in
the
record
on
that.
on
electric
energy,
and
i
am
talking
about
reactive
power.
if
you
could
get
pass
it,
then
you
would
have
counter
current
flows
of
electric
energy
and
the
commission
experts
with
us
has
agreed
that
that
can
not
be
done.
now,
for
the
fpc,
the
commission
to
have
jurisdiction
over
us,
it
has
to
prove
this,
electric
energy
from
florida
flowed
180
miles
through
the
system
of
what
we
called
corp
or
power
corp
into
our
system
or
vice
versa
went
from
us
up
to
corp
into
the
state
of
georgia
without
meeting
any
barriers
of
a
load
big
enough
to
swallow
it
or
a
counter
current
flow.
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
yes
sir,
because
we
can
not
control
the
flow
with
that
interface.
you
had
to
hold
a
switch
--
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
that
is
correct.
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
yes.
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
it
is
a
large
company,
it
is
not
larger
than
ours.
it
is
a
large
company
and
it
has
numerous
sources
of
power
within
it,
it
has
a
bunch
of
buses
that
have
to
go
through
with
flows
going
at
different
directions.
so,
this
electric
current
does
not
just
travel
a
straight
line
from
one
system
through
the
middle
one
up
to
georgia.
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
no
sir,
i
am
not
saying
that
it
necessarily
does
not
do
florida
power
or
fpl
any
a
good.
we
do
not
depend
on
it.
it
might
be
that
there
are
some
great
strategies.
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
we
can
only
draw
up
to
100
megawatts
from
the
state
of
georgia
other
than
most
favorable
circumstances
that
could
ever
happen.
but
as
far
as
it
can
be
determined,
we
would
get
all
our
energy
from
corp,
the
intervening
company
in
case
we
need
it
that
much.
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
if
they
had
it.
now,
the
commission
does
admit
mr.
justice,
that
jurisdiction
did
not
depend
on
what
might
possibly
happen
but
what
actually
does
happen.
transmission
facilities
--
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
maybe
i
did
understand.
if
georgia
electric
energy
flows
through
corp
into
our
system,
we
are
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission.
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
not
if
it
ever
could
happen
because
any
system
can
be
arranged
to
where
such
flows
can
take
place
but
even
the
commission
agree
that
it
does
not
depends
on
or
some
way
you
could
arrange
it
to
make
it
happen
but
depends
on
what
actually
does
happen.
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
it
could
possibly
happen.
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
only
if
all
the
loads
and
flows
in
corp
are
in
one
certain
way
and
they
are
not.
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
there
is
no
suggestion,
that
has
ever
happened,
they
tried
on
22
different
days
over
a
period
of
months
to
trace
such
flows.
by
their
theory,
they
said
they
did,
by
our
theory,
we
say
they
did
not,
the
fifth
circuit
says
we
do
not
necessarily
follow
fpl’s
theory
but
we
think
the
one
that
they
have
is
to
inspect
--the
commission
has
to
inspect
it.
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
we
are
talking
about
the
actual
flows
as
distinguished
from
the
cause
and
the
effect.
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
yes.
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
the
examiner
was
very
honest
in
what
he
said,
he
said
based
upon
the
commission’s
theory
actual
flows
are
proved
based
upon
fpl’s
theories
that
reverse
is
proved
that
no
such
flows
and
i
will
be
happy
to
discuss
what
went
in
on
those
flows.
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
addressing
myself,
i
have
to
say
that
the
commission’s
conclusion
even
though
your
experts
was
contrary
--
the
commission's
conclusions
were
not
binding
upon
the
fifth
circuit.
that
is
our
position
that
the
commission’s
conclusion
are
not
bindings
on
the
fifth
circuit
or
upon
this
court.
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
i
think
it
is
page
13
of
our
brief,
top
of
page
13,
the
examiner
in
our
brief.
on
the
basis
of
the
commingled
method,
that
is
fpc’s,
it
can
be
proved
that
electric
energy
is
transmitted
between
florida
or
fpl
and
georgia
on
the
basis
of
the
system
study
method,
that
is
one
we
use,
the
contrary
follows.
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
but
we
only
have
six
wholesale
sales
and
it
would
be
required
not
electric
energy
just
get
in
to
our
system
but
it
get
there
to
those
wholesale
sales.
and
this
court
held
in
the
colton
case
that
merely
being
--
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
it
is
our
belief
that
is
why
we
have
the
federal
power,
i
guess
a
principal
concern.
but
here
the
commission
says
“that
is
not
what
we
are
asking,
we
are
asking
to
keep
your
books
--
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
i
do
not
know
whether
they
go
that
far.
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
their
theory
is
that
quite
a
few
days
to
1964,
electric
energy
flowed
from
georgia
into
our
system.
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
and
that
is
enough
and
not
just
going
on
all
the
time.
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
no,
it
was
not
emergency.
and
our
disagreement
with
them
is
this.
there
is
so
called
commingled
in
a
bus
theory
that
they
use
which
treats
a
bus
as
a
point
which
it
is
not
because,
it
is
just
a
wire
big
as
my
thumb
225
feet
long.
and
the
only
excuse
that
they
use
for
doing
that
and
by
the
way
the
treatment
of
a
bus,
the
difference
between
us
and
them.
the
only
excuse
they
use
and
they
set
it
forth
several
times
in
their
brief,
is
that
there
are
reverse
flows
of
power
in
each
of
the
120
power
cycles
per
second
in
an
electric
conduit.
that
is
while
the
power
goes
one
direction
most
of
the
time,
every
120th
of
a
second,
there
is
a
little
reverse
blip.
and
they
say
because
of
that,
we
need
to
treat
as
a
point
because
these
reverse
blips
are
not
shown
on
watt
meters
and
i
answer
that
is
two
fold.
one,
that
reverse
blip
is
reactive
power,
they
so
admit
it,
they
pay
184
or
174
of
the
transcript.
by
definition
reactive
power
is
not
electric
energy.
the
real
power
which
is
the
fourth
part
of
the
transmission
is
by
definition
electric
energy
and
they
agree
on
page
174,
that
the
real
power
does
not
reverse.
it
always
goes
through
--
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
reactive
power.
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
yes,
sir.
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
yes,
sir
because
again
--
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
the
experts
do
not
disagree
that
reactive
power
only
reverses.
they
do
not
disagree
that
real
power
goes
only
from
generation
to
load
and
by
definition
we
have
set
forth
in
one
of
our
footnotes,
the
reactive
power
is
not
energy.
also
the
experts
agree
that
reactive
power
is
not
measured
by
watt
meters.
watt
meters
only
measure
real
powers
and
that
is
what--
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
there
is
not
a
disagreement
on
point
because
the
commission
expert
very
carefully
use
the
word
power
in
a
broad
sense.
it
was
only
when
they
were
pinned
down,
they
pointed
out
the
distinction
between
real
power
and
reactive
power.
the
only
time
we
know
of
that
is
business
of
reverse
flows
has
been
passed
on
a
jurisdiction
case
is
in
the
connecticut
power
case
who
came
up
to
this
court.
and
in
that
case
the
expert
for
the
connecticut
company
trying
to
show
lack
of
jurisdiction
by
saying,
look
there
are
some
reverse
flows
that
you
got
to
take
in
to
consideration
and
they
do
not
show
up
on
watt
meters.
the
commission
way
back
then
rejected
that
saying
“look,
we
go
on
what
is
shown
on
a
watt
meter”
that
is
what
the
electric
energy
business
is
based
on.
the
court
of
appeals
agrees.
according
this
court’s
decision
in
the
jersey
central
case
and
this
court
on
appeals
said
there
was
no
question
about
interstate
flow.
so,
our
positions
on
the
trace
is
this
that
the
experts,
taking
their
own
expert
evidence
there
is
still
no
reversed
flow
of
electric
energy
and
that
is
what
the
statute
says
is
required
to
have
--
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
that
is
correct,
they
did
not
say
that
which
was
reversing
was
electric
energy
because
they
say
on
page
174,
that
this
real
power
goes
forward
only
and
that
by
definition
is
electric
energy
and
reverse
flow
by
definition
is
not.
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
i
will
be
happy
to
talk
about
the
other.
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
yes.
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
thank
you.
now,
with
respect
to
what
the
commission
says
it
is
a
principal
thrust
is
a
so-called
cause
and
effect
of
electro
magnetic
entity
of
response.
there
is
nothing
magic
about
that,
this
has
existence
ever
since
the
first
two
alternating
current
generators
were
ever
hooked
up
to
a
load.
ever
since
then
which
was
long
before
the
federal
power
commission
was
ever
heard
of.
it
means
that
anytime
two
or
more
generators
are
supplying
one
or
more
loads,
they
inherently
and
unavoidably
generate
electricity
at
the
same
frequency.
they
can
not
help
it.
and
as
a
result
when
the
load
is
changed
on
one
it
has
an
effect
on
the
other
but
it
does
not
change
the
direction
of
transmission.
for
example,
if
you
would
look
on
page
11
of
our
brief,
there
is
shown
there
a
line,
a
horizontal
line
cd
which
is
a
transmission
line.
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
11.
below
that
line
are
letters
g
which
shows
generators
and
letters
l
that
show
loads.
if
the
right
hand
load
l5
were
increased
a
little
bit,
what
happens?
the
next
generator
to
it,
the
one
that
is
normally
supplying
it,
will
instantaneously
pick
up
a
little
generation
and
draw
also
perhaps
a
little
bit
a
current
from
electric
energy
from
l4.
well,
that
means
then
that
g5,
the
next
one
to
the
left
is
going
to
have
to
pick
up
a
little
to
supply
l4
and
so
on
down
the
line,
but
the
directions
of
flow
of
electric
energy
do
not
change
merely
the
magnitude.
now,
that
is
a
cause
and
effect,
that
is
the
swapping
that
the
examiner
talked
about
and
we
say
that
is
not
the
jurisdictional
event.
say
no
experts
testify
that
we
confine.
testified
as
result
of
that
there
was
inherently
transmission
across
the
state
line.
the
high
line
control
with
frequency
bias
is
nothing
magic.
what
that
means
is
at
the
edge
of
each
system
are
tie
lines
to
another
systems.
and
each
systems
senses
what
the
frequency
is,
if
it
drops
it
just
generates
a
little
more
electric
energy.
no
signal
could
come
from
some
place
way
out.
we
say
this
cause
and
effect
is
directly
contrary
to
this
court's
decision
in
the
jersey
central
case
where
it
specifically
said
interconnection
does
not
mean
everything
that
actual
transmission
is
required.
i
believe
that
concludes
my
argument.
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
first
i
would
like
to
answer
two
or
three
statements
made
by
the
fpc
with
respect
to
the
colton
case.
florida
power
light
company
used
the
tracing
used
in
the
colton
case.
the
fpc
used
a
different
method
as
in
this
present
situation
here,
we
fpl
use
the
colton
method
of
tracing.
please
do
not
confuse
the
terms
power
and
the
electric
energy,
they
are
not
synonymous.
this
is
a
play
on
words,
it
was
brought
in
the
record
before
the
examiners
and
i
will
get
into
that
in
a
little
more
detail
later
on.
the
electric
energy
never
reverses.
it
always
goes
from
generator
to
load.
your
house
bulb
does
not
supply
electric
energy
back
to
the
generator.
there
is
something
called
reactive
power
which
during
part
of
a
cycle
does
reverse
but
that
by
definition
is
not
energy.
and
the
commission
witnesses
be
very
careful
to
speak
about
power
and
not
about
electric
energy.
next,
getting
back
to
there
first
and
primary
basis,
cooperation
between
utilities
does
not
determine
jurisdiction,
interstate
transmission
does.
neither
does
clock
speed
determine
jurisdiction.
and
further,
we
have
we
been
unable
to
find
in
the
record
any
testimony
of
any
witness
that
the
cause
and
effect
theory
is
actual
transmission
of
electric
energy
in
interstate
commerce.
dr.
jessel
and
the
others
did
not
so
testify
that
we
can
find
or
what
we
look
for.
this
was
a
3:2
decision
by
the
commission
with
the
strong
dissent.
to
review
for
a
moment
the
jurisdictional
requirements,
a
statute
says,
jurisdiction
depends
upon
transmission
of
electric
energy
only
in
interstate
commerce
and
it
specifically
excludes
jurisdiction
over
facilities
used
for
the
transmission
electric
energy
only
in
intrastate
commerce.
the
statute
also
says
that
electric
energy
shall
be
held
to
be
transmitted
in
interstate
commerce
if
transmitted
from
a
state
and
consumed
at
any
point
outside
thereof.
the
commissions
positions
seems
to
be
that
it
should
not
be
subject
these
restrictions
or
it
may
take
astonishing
position
on
page
36
of
this
brief
right
in
the
middle
of
that
page
that
it
should
not
have
to
abstain
from
asserting
his
jurisdiction
“until
such
time
if
ever
as
it
can
be
proven
as
a
fact
in
common
law
terms
that
there
is
an
actual
transmission.”
we
say
there
is
tantamount
to
an
admission
that
they
have
not
been
able
to
prove
their
case.
and
it
is
a
good
reason
but
they
could
not
prove
because
the
facts
just
are
not
there.
since
we
are
talking
about
transmission
of
electric
energy,
i
plead
that
thermal
electric
energy
needs
to
be
known.
electric
energy
is
defined
by
the
commission
in
its
text,
by
others,
as
that
which
does
work
and
is
normally
measured
in
kilowatt
hours.
it
is
what
we
all
as
householders
pay
for
each
month,
when
we
pay
our
bill.
so
many
kilowatt
hours
of
electric
energy
measured
by
that
electric
meters
sitting
on
the
back
of
our
house.
we
believe
in
essential
to
understanding
of
this
case
that
certain
facts
concerning
undisputed
nature
of
an
electric
energy
be
understood.
i
realize
there
are
some
facts
that
are
not
agreed
upon
but
these
facts
at
least
are.
one
there
is
no
storage
or
pooling
of
electric
energy.
it
is
generated
and
consumed
instantly.
a
generator
never
puts
out
more
electric
energy
than
is
consumed.
the
load
tells
how
much
is
to
be
put
out.
for
example,
if
a
generator
is
running
at
full
speed,
there
is
no
load
on
it,
there
is
no
electric
energy
being
produced
by
that
generator.
next,
there
can
be
no
flow
of
electric
energy
in
opposite
directions
in
a
conduit
simultaneously.
they
all,
the
commission
fully
agrees.
third,
you
cannot
get
the
electric
energy
flow
from
a
generator
pass
the
first
load
that
is
bigger
than
the
generation
is.
that
load
is
insatiable
and
instantaneous,
it
gobbles
up
all
electric
energy
and
not
one
bit
gets
fastest
and
there
is
no
disagreement
in
the
record
on
that.
on
electric
energy,
and
i
am
talking
about
reactive
power.
if
you
could
get
pass
it,
then
you
would
have
counter
current
flows
of
electric
energy
and
the
commission
experts
with
us
has
agreed
that
that
can
not
be
done.
now,
for
the
fpc,
the
commission
to
have
jurisdiction
over
us,
it
has
to
prove
this,
electric
energy
from
florida
flowed
180
miles
through
the
system
of
what
we
called
corp
or
power
corp
into
our
system
or
vice
versa
went
from
us
up
to
corp
into
the
state
of
georgia
without
meeting
any
barriers
of
a
load
big
enough
to
swallow
it
or
a
counter
current
flow.
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
yes
sir,
because
we
can
not
control
the
flow
with
that
interface.
you
had
to
hold
a
switch
--
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
that
is
correct.
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
yes.
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
it
is
a
large
company,
it
is
not
larger
than
ours.
it
is
a
large
company
and
it
has
numerous
sources
of
power
within
it,
it
has
a
bunch
of
buses
that
have
to
go
through
with
flows
going
at
different
directions.
so,
this
electric
current
does
not
just
travel
a
straight
line
from
one
system
through
the
middle
one
up
to
georgia.
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
no
sir,
i
am
not
saying
that
it
necessarily
does
not
do
florida
power
or
fpl
any
a
good.
we
do
not
depend
on
it.
it
might
be
that
there
are
some
great
strategies.
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
we
can
only
draw
up
to
100
megawatts
from
the
state
of
georgia
other
than
most
favorable
circumstances
that
could
ever
happen.
but
as
far
as
it
can
be
determined,
we
would
get
all
our
energy
from
corp,
the
intervening
company
in
case
we
need
it
that
much.
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
if
they
had
it.
now,
the
commission
does
admit
mr.
justice,
that
jurisdiction
did
not
depend
on
what
might
possibly
happen
but
what
actually
does
happen.
transmission
facilities
--
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
maybe
i
did
understand.
if
georgia
electric
energy
flows
through
corp
into
our
system,
we
are
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission.
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
not
if
it
ever
could
happen
because
any
system
can
be
arranged
to
where
such
flows
can
take
place
but
even
the
commission
agree
that
it
does
not
depends
on
or
some
way
you
could
arrange
it
to
make
it
happen
but
depends
on
what
actually
does
happen.
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
it
could
possibly
happen.
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
only
if
all
the
loads
and
flows
in
corp
are
in
one
certain
way
and
they
are
not.
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
there
is
no
suggestion,
that
has
ever
happened,
they
tried
on
22
different
days
over
a
period
of
months
to
trace
such
flows.
by
their
theory,
they
said
they
did,
by
our
theory,
we
say
they
did
not,
the
fifth
circuit
says
we
do
not
necessarily
follow
fpl’s
theory
but
we
think
the
one
that
they
have
is
to
inspect
--the
commission
has
to
inspect
it.
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
we
are
talking
about
the
actual
flows
as
distinguished
from
the
cause
and
the
effect.
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
yes.
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
the
examiner
was
very
honest
in
what
he
said,
he
said
based
upon
the
commission’s
theory
actual
flows
are
proved
based
upon
fpl’s
theories
that
reverse
is
proved
that
no
such
flows
and
i
will
be
happy
to
discuss
what
went
in
on
those
flows.
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
addressing
myself,
i
have
to
say
that
the
commission’s
conclusion
even
though
your
experts
was
contrary
--
the
commission's
conclusions
were
not
binding
upon
the
fifth
circuit.
that
is
our
position
that
the
commission’s
conclusion
are
not
bindings
on
the
fifth
circuit
or
upon
this
court.
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
i
think
it
is
page
13
of
our
brief,
top
of
page
13,
the
examiner
in
our
brief.
on
the
basis
of
the
commingled
method,
that
is
fpc’s,
it
can
be
proved
that
electric
energy
is
transmitted
between
florida
or
fpl
and
georgia
on
the
basis
of
the
system
study
method,
that
is
one
we
use,
the
contrary
follows.
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
but
we
only
have
six
wholesale
sales
and
it
would
be
required
not
electric
energy
just
get
in
to
our
system
but
it
get
there
to
those
wholesale
sales.
and
this
court
held
in
the
colton
case
that
merely
being
--
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
it
is
our
belief
that
is
why
we
have
the
federal
power,
i
guess
a
principal
concern.
but
here
the
commission
says
“that
is
not
what
we
are
asking,
we
are
asking
to
keep
your
books
--
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
i
do
not
know
whether
they
go
that
far.
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
their
theory
is
that
quite
a
few
days
to
1964,
electric
energy
flowed
from
georgia
into
our
system.
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
and
that
is
enough
and
not
just
going
on
all
the
time.
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
no,
it
was
not
emergency.
and
our
disagreement
with
them
is
this.
there
is
so
called
commingled
in
a
bus
theory
that
they
use
which
treats
a
bus
as
a
point
which
it
is
not
because,
it
is
just
a
wire
big
as
my
thumb
225
feet
long.
and
the
only
excuse
that
they
use
for
doing
that
and
by
the
way
the
treatment
of
a
bus,
the
difference
between
us
and
them.
the
only
excuse
they
use
and
they
set
it
forth
several
times
in
their
brief,
is
that
there
are
reverse
flows
of
power
in
each
of
the
120
power
cycles
per
second
in
an
electric
conduit.
that
is
while
the
power
goes
one
direction
most
of
the
time,
every
120th
of
a
second,
there
is
a
little
reverse
blip.
and
they
say
because
of
that,
we
need
to
treat
as
a
point
because
these
reverse
blips
are
not
shown
on
watt
meters
and
i
answer
that
is
two
fold.
one,
that
reverse
blip
is
reactive
power,
they
so
admit
it,
they
pay
184
or
174
of
the
transcript.
by
definition
reactive
power
is
not
electric
energy.
the
real
power
which
is
the
fourth
part
of
the
transmission
is
by
definition
electric
energy
and
they
agree
on
page
174,
that
the
real
power
does
not
reverse.
it
always
goes
through
--
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
reactive
power.
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
yes,
sir.
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
yes,
sir
because
again
--
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
the
experts
do
not
disagree
that
reactive
power
only
reverses.
they
do
not
disagree
that
real
power
goes
only
from
generation
to
load
and
by
definition
we
have
set
forth
in
one
of
our
footnotes,
the
reactive
power
is
not
energy.
also
the
experts
agree
that
reactive
power
is
not
measured
by
watt
meters.
watt
meters
only
measure
real
powers
and
that
is
what--
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
there
is
not
a
disagreement
on
point
because
the
commission
expert
very
carefully
use
the
word
power
in
a
broad
sense.
it
was
only
when
they
were
pinned
down,
they
pointed
out
the
distinction
between
real
power
and
reactive
power.
the
only
time
we
know
of
that
is
business
of
reverse
flows
has
been
passed
on
a
jurisdiction
case
is
in
the
connecticut
power
case
who
came
up
to
this
court.
and
in
that
case
the
expert
for
the
connecticut
company
trying
to
show
lack
of
jurisdiction
by
saying,
look
there
are
some
reverse
flows
that
you
got
to
take
in
to
consideration
and
they
do
not
show
up
on
watt
meters.
the
commission
way
back
then
rejected
that
saying
“look,
we
go
on
what
is
shown
on
a
watt
meter”
that
is
what
the
electric
energy
business
is
based
on.
the
court
of
appeals
agrees.
according
this
court’s
decision
in
the
jersey
central
case
and
this
court
on
appeals
said
there
was
no
question
about
interstate
flow.
so,
our
positions
on
the
trace
is
this
that
the
experts,
taking
their
own
expert
evidence
there
is
still
no
reversed
flow
of
electric
energy
and
that
is
what
the
statute
says
is
required
to
have
--
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
that
is
correct,
they
did
not
say
that
which
was
reversing
was
electric
energy
because
they
say
on
page
174,
that
this
real
power
goes
forward
only
and
that
by
definition
is
electric
energy
and
reverse
flow
by
definition
is
not.
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
i
will
be
happy
to
talk
about
the
other.
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
yes.
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
thank
you.
now,
with
respect
to
what
the
commission
says
it
is
a
principal
thrust
is
a
so-called
cause
and
effect
of
electro
magnetic
entity
of
response.
there
is
nothing
magic
about
that,
this
has
existence
ever
since
the
first
two
alternating
current
generators
were
ever
hooked
up
to
a
load.
ever
since
then
which
was
long
before
the
federal
power
commission
was
ever
heard
of.
it
means
that
anytime
two
or
more
generators
are
supplying
one
or
more
loads,
they
inherently
and
unavoidably
generate
electricity
at
the
same
frequency.
they
can
not
help
it.
and
as
a
result
when
the
load
is
changed
on
one
it
has
an
effect
on
the
other
but
it
does
not
change
the
direction
of
transmission.
for
example,
if
you
would
look
on
page
11
of
our
brief,
there
is
shown
there
a
line,
a
horizontal
line
cd
which
is
a
transmission
line.
mr.
jefferson
d.
giller
11.
below
that
line
are
letters
g
which
shows
generators
and
letters
l
that
show
loads.
if
the
right
hand
load
l5
were
increased
a
little
bit,
what
happens?
the
next
generator
to
it,
the
one
that
is
normally
supplying
it,
will
instantaneously
pick
up
a
little
generation
and
draw
also
perhaps
a
little
bit
a
current
from
electric
energy
from
l4.
well,
that
means
then
that
g5,
the
next
one
to
the
left
is
going
to
have
to
pick
up
a
little
to
supply
l4
and
so
on
down
the
line,
but
the
directions
of
flow
of
electric
energy
do
not
change
merely
the
magnitude.
now,
that
is
a
cause
and
effect,
that
is
the
swapping
that
the
examiner
talked
about
and
we
say
that
is
not
the
jurisdictional
event.
say
no
experts
testify
that
we
confine.
testified
as
result
of
that
there
was
inherently
transmission
across
the
state
line.
the
high
line
control
with
frequency
bias
is
nothing
magic.
what
that
means
is
at
the
edge
of
each
system
are
tie
lines
to
another
systems.
and
each
systems
senses
what
the
frequency
is,
if
it
drops
it
just
generates
a
little
more
electric
energy.
no
signal
could
come
from
some
place
way
out.
we
say
this
cause
and
effect
is
directly
contrary
to
this
court's
decision
in
the
jersey
central
case
where
it
specifically
said
interconnection
does
not
mean
everything
that
actual
transmission
is
required.
i
believe
that
concludes
my
argument.
