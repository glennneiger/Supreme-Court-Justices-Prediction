mr.
samuel
huntington
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
in
this
case
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
fifth
circuit
is
whether
respondent
owns
and
operates
facilities
for
the
transmission
of
electric
energy
in
interstate
commerce.
if
respondent
does,
then
it
is
a
“public
utility”
subject
to
the
commission’s
jurisdiction
under
section
201
of
the
federal
power
act.
under
section
201,
electric
energy
is
deemed
to
be
transmitted
in
interstate
commerce
if
“transmitted
from
a
state
and
consumed
at
any
point
outside
thereof.”
on
the
basis
of
an
extensive
record,
the
commission
concluded
that
electric
energy
was
indeed
transmitted
from
respondent’s
facilities
in
florida
and
consumed
out
of
state.
this
conclusion
was
based
independently,
one
on
analysis
of
the
independence
of
respondent
and
out
of
state
utilities
and
two
on
studies
introduced
by
the
commission
staff
showing
that
electric
power
flows
could
be
traced
from
respondent’s
facilities
to
an
out-of-state
utility.
before
turning
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
i
would
like
to
note
just
briefly
the
consequences
of
commission
jurisdiction.
the
only
immediate
consequence
in
this
case,
if
the
commission’s
order
is
upheld
by
this
court,
would
be
to
require
respondent
to
comply
with
the
commission's
uniform
system
of
account.
the
establishment
of
jurisdiction
however
would
also
subject
respondent's
future
wholesale
sales
of
electric
energy
to
commission
jurisdiction
and
also
would
enable
the
commission
under
certain
circumstances
to
what
a
respondent
could
interconnect
and
sell
electric
energy
to
other
utilities.
the
pertinent
facts
in
this
case
are
as
follows:
respondent
is
a
major
electric
utility,
it
is
the
largest
utility
in
florida
and
in
1965
ranked
ninth
in
the
nation
in
terms
of
revenues.
its
facilities
are
located
wholly
within
the
state
of
florida
and
serve
over
900,000
customers
--
six
of
them
were
wholesale
customers.
although,
none
of
its
facilities
extend
to
the
state
line,
respondent
is
interconnected
with
the
florida
power
corporation
and
the
florida
power
corporation
in
turn
is
interconnected
with
the
georgia
power
company
as
well
as
other
utilities
across
the
state
line.
in
addition
to
its
interconnection
with
the
florida
power
corporation,
respondent
is
interconnected
with
three
other
florida
utilities
and
these
five
florida
utilities
make
up
the
florida
operating
committee.
through
the
committee,
these
utilities
coordinate
the
installation
and
maintenance
of
generating
equipment.
they
share
generating
reserves
and
they
exchange
information
on
a
daily
basis
to
better
coordinate
their
operations.
by
these
activities
therefore
each
member
is
able
to
provide
its
customers
with
more
reliable
service.
as
i
mentioned
before,
the
florida
power
corporation
has
interconnections
across
the
state
line
with
the
georgia
power
company
and
these
two
companies
exchange
substantial
amounts
of
electric
energy
from
year
to
year.
all
of
the
utilities,
that
i
have
referred
to
thus
far
are
members
of
the
140-member
interconnected
systems
group,
a
group
of
interconnected
utilities
spanning
the
southeast
and
central
portions
of
the
united
states.
the
first
ground
of
the
commission's
finding
of
jurisdiction
in
this
case
was
based
on
an
analysis
of
respondents
operation
as
a
part
of
its
vast
interconnected
system.
as
the
commission
staff
expert
witness
testified,
all
our
140
members
of
the
interconnected
systems
group
and
indeed
all
interconnected
systems,
operate
in
synchronism
--
that
is
they
all
operate
at
precisely
the
same
frequency.
on
modern
systems
charges
as
current
is
supplied
as
alternating
current,
alternating
at
60
cycles
per
second.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
there
are
some
isolated
municipal
operations.
mr.
samuel
huntington
at
this
point
there
are
--
most
of
the
nation’s
facilities
are
interconnected,
yes.
mr.
samuel
huntington
every
utility
has
been
interconnected.
i
do
not
think
the
argument
does
not
go
quite
that
far
because
we
depend
upon
an
analysis
of
the
operations
by
reason
of
interconnection.
i
think
there
could
be—
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
i
do
not
think
necessarily
because
hence,
i
think
it
depends
to
some
extent
on
the
extent
to
which
the
operations
are
coordinated.
now
it
is
possible--
mr.
samuel
huntington
no,
it
is
possible
for
instance
to
have
an
interconnection
that
will
open
in
the
event
of
any
kind
of
disturbance.
now
that
situation
we
would
say
that
the
two
utilities
would
not
be
coordinated
so
as
to
provide
mutual
system
in
the
case—
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
it
might
be
such
an
interconnection
so
that
if
a
utility
wanted
to
purchase
power
from
the
other
utility
it
could
at
a
certain
rate
over
period
of
time
but
the
interconnection
would
not
be
strong
enough
to
allow
emergency
service
in
the
event
at
a
very
large
generating
unit
would
go
out
on
one
side
of
the
interconnection.
in
these
circumstances,
we
would
suggest
that
you
have
quite
a,
you
have
a
minimal
amount
of
coordination
between
utilities
and
you
certainly
do
not
have
the
situation
that
you
have.
mr.
samuel
huntington
it
is
not
the
usual
situation
now,
i
think
at
the
time
the
federal
power
act
was
enacted,
there
were
situations
where
you
had
a
limited
type
interconnections.
most
of
the
interconnections
in
this
country
today
allow
for
the
type
of
operations
that
we
are
describing
here.
mr.
samuel
huntington
that
being
too
well—
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
we
do
admit
that
yes
that
is
right,
that
there
will
be
certain
small
utilities
that
will
be
subject
to
the
commission’s
jurisdiction.
i
would
like
to
just
point
out—
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
municipals
are
not
covered.
they
are
exempted—
mr.
samuel
huntington
there
about
450
privately
owned
utilities
in
the
country
i
think,
or
about
350
of
them
are
public
utilities
subject
to
the
commission’s
jurisdiction
at
this
point.
there
would
be
some
additional
ones
which
would
become
public
utilities
and
our
theory
here
is
accepted
by
this
court.
i
would
like
to
just
point
out
that
the
constant—
mr.
samuel
huntington
yes,
but
the
exception
of
the
state
of
texas
which
is
isolated
has
no
interconnections
across
the
state
line,
but
virtually
every
other
large
utility,
well,
not
every
other,
but
certainly
most
large
utilities
are
subject
to
the
commission’s
jurisdictions.
with
respect
to
the
small
utilities,
i
would
like
to
just
point
out
that
the
consequences
of
jurisdiction
maybe
very
small
for
some
utilities.
without
reaching
the
question
as
to
whether
the
commissions
has
discretion
to
decline
to
exercise
jurisdiction
in
certain
circumstances.
the
commission
does
have
the
specific
authority
to
classify
utilities
and
to
prescribe
different
rules
depending
upon
the
class.
now
this
is
done
with
respect
to
the
commission’s
accounting
requirements,
the
commission
has
established
five
different
classes
of
utilities
based
on
their
revenues
with
very
specific
requirements
for
the
large
utilities
and
very
minimal
requirements
for
the
small
utilities.
so
in
the
event
that
a
relatively
small
utility
is
interconnected
to
the
interstate
grid
and
is
subject
to
the
commission’s
jurisdiction,
the
effect
on
that
utility
maybe
very
small,
the
effect
of
the
federal
jurisdiction.
well,
because
all
systems
operate
in
synchronism,
this
means
that
the
generators
connected
to
the
interstate
network,
all
operate
at
precisely
the
same
frequency
and
that
they
speed
up
and
slow
down
in
units.
and
all
electric
clocks
for
instance
attached
to
the
interstate
network
whether
it
be
in
saint
louis
or
miami,
will
keep
precisely
the
same
time.
now,
electric
energy
cannot
be
stored
so
that
the
total
generation
of
a
network
is
constantly
adjusting
to
meet
the
networks
total
load.
in
order
to
assure
that
each
utility
ultimately
produces
enough
power
to
supply
its
customers
and
any
obligation
it
might
have
to
neighboring
utilities
and
in
order
to
assure
that
frequency
is
maintained
as
closely
as
possible
at
60
cycles
per
second,
each
system
employs
what
is
known
as
high
line
control
with
frequency
bias.
now,
the
operation
of
high
line
control
with
frequency
bias
is
explained
in
some
detail
in
our
brief
and
i
do
not
plan
go
into
the
mechanics
of
it
here.
what
is
important
to
note
is
that
this
control
method,
under
this
control
method,
each
member
of
the
interconnected
systems
group
shares
in
the
burden
of
maintaining
network
frequency
as
closely
as
possible
to
60
cycles
per
second
and
under
the
control
method,
each
member
will
contribute
increased
generation
to
meet
an
emergency
on
another
members
system.
the
record
contains
a
dramatic
example
of
the
response
of
systems
comprising
this
interstate
network
to
an
emergency.
on
february
17th
,
1965
a
midwestern
utility
in
the
interconnected
systems
groups
suffered
a
generation
loss
of
580
megawatts.
this
loss
caused
a
drop
in
frequency
on
the
interconnected
system.
each
of
the
other
systems
including
respondent
reacted
automatically
to
make
up
the
deficiency.
respondent’s
contribution
as
shown
by
exhibits
in
the
record
was
to
increase
each
generation
by
eight
megawatts.
other
benefits
that
also
accrue
from
interconnected
operations
are
as
follows:
as
a
result
of
frequency
bias,
deviations
in
the
frequency
are
kept
to
a
minimum,
clocks
keep
better
time,
precision
industrial
operations
are
benefited,
speed
ups
and
slow
downs
of
generating
equipment
are
minimized,
and
as
a
result
the
inadvertent
exchange
of
energy
between
systems
is
also
minimized.
in
short,
the
evidence
before
the
commission
showed
that
respondent,
the
other
florida
utilities
and
the
other
members
of
interconnected
systems
group,
all
operates
interdependently.
all
the
components
of
their
respective
systems
are
bonded
together
electromagnetically.
that
is
as
an
engineering
fact,
the
components
are
tied
together
electrically
and
magnetically.
as
a
result,
the
occurrence
of
an
event
on
one
system
will
have
a
necessary
and
measurable
effect
in
other
systems.
in
a
thorough
and
clear
opinion,
the
hearing
examiner
concluded
that
the
cause
and
effect
relationship
among
respondent
and
the
out
of
state
utilities
constituted
the
interstate
transmission
of
electric
energy.
this
conclusion
was
approved
by
the
commission
and
we
believe
this
is
fully
supported
by
the
evidence
just
summarized
and
furthermore
is
consistent
with
the
scheme
of
regulation
adopted
by
congress
in
enacting
the
federal
power
act.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
that
now.
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
reveals
the
dual
concern
on
the
part
of
congress.
on
the
one
hand,
congress
recognized
the
increasing
tendency
to
interconnect
utilities
and
recognized
that
there
is
a
need
for
federal
leadership
in
coordinating
the
interconnection
of
these
utilities
and
coordinating
the
nation’s
power
facilities.
on
the
other
hand,
congress
made
clear
that
its
intention
not
do
unduly
interfere
with
the
authority
of
state
regulatory
commissions.
as
this
court
recognized
in
the
connecticut
light
and
power
case,
congress
resolved
these
competing
concerns
first
by
defining
the
terms
of
grant
of
federal
jurisdiction,
broadly
and
precisely,
employing
in
the
words
of
this
court
an
engineering
or
scientific
test.
second,
the
granted
jurisdiction
was
then
limited
by
exempting
certain
facilities
and
most
importantly
by
limiting
the
commission’s
rate
jurisdiction
to
sales
of
interstate
energy
at
wholesale.
now,
since
the
enactment
of
the
federal
power
act,
vast
interconnected
systems
have
replaced
relatively
modest
networks
and
the
interstate
nature
of
the
electric
industry
has
steadily
risen.
what
happens
on
one
part
of
a
network
can
have
a
dramatic
and
sometimes
catastrophic
effect
on
the
other
parts
of
the
network
as
is
happened
in
various
power
failures
in
the
last
few
years.
the
hearing
examiner
noted
the
1965
northeast
power
failure.
we
are
not
talking
here
about
some
remote
effect
on
commerce
such
as
you
might
be
discussing
in
terms
of
other
regulatory
statutes.
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
an
electrical
effect
throughout
a
common
network.
we
are
talking
about
an
engineering
fact
that
when
you
have
a
disturbance
on
one
system
it
causes
a
reaction
on
other
systems.
in
short,
we
submit
that
the
jurisdictional
test
adopted
by
congress
was
designed
to
and
is
capable
of
taking
into
account
the
complex
and
interdependent
nature
of
interconnected
electric
systems.
mr.
samuel
huntington
we
place
a
great
deal
of
reliance
on
this,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
huntington
no.
we
do
not
believe
so.
we
believe
the
language
of
statute
is
transmitted
in
interstate
commerce,
electric
energy
moving
from
moving
from
one
state
to
another.
now,
if
there
is
a
disturbance
in
one
state
such
as
a
loss
of
generating
equipment
and
if
the
other
states
contribute
by
plan
control
mechanism,
this
high
line
bias
with
frequency
control,
this
is
a
system
developed
in
the
last
ten
or
fifteen
years
which
was
not
in
effect
when
the
power
act
was
first
enacted.
if
true,
this
common
control
mechanism
signals
a
sent-out
to
the
other
systems
supply
extra
power
until
this
disturbance
is
cleared
up.
we
submit
that
this
is
a
transmission
of
electric
energy
that
the
cause
and
effect
relationship
here,
disturbance
plus
contribution
in
neighboring
systems
to
increase
generation
in
response
to
a
very
sophisticated
control
mechanism.
we
claim
that
this
does
constitute
the
jurisdictional
standard
and
engineering
fact
which
is
what
congress
had
in
mind
in
setting
forth
the
bounds
of
jurisdiction.
well,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
alternate
basis
for
commission
jurisdiction
which
is
completely
independent
from
the
basis
i
have
been
discussing
thus
far.
at
the
hearing
before
the
examiner,
the
commission’s
staff
introduced
studies
based
on
data
for
commercial
meters
which
show
that
at
times
during
1964,
electric
energy
flowed
from
the
georgia
power
company
to
respondent
over
the
facilities
at
the
florida
power
corporation
and
at
other
times
flowed
the
other
way.
respondents
attack
on
these
studies
focuses
on
the
staff’s
treatment
of
the
conducted
bars
used
to
join
together
transmission
lines.
these
bars
or
junction
points
are
known
as
buses.
what
the
staff
did
was
to
assume
that
energy
flowing
into
a
bus
on
two
or
more
transmission
lines
becomes
mixed
together
or
commingled,
thus
energy
flowing
out
of
the
bus
on
other
transmission
lines
would
be
commingled
energy.
that
is
would
include
energy
from
all
the
lines
entering
the
bus.
to
understand
the
basis
for
this
assumption,
some
background
is
necessary.
electric
energy
on
all
commercial
systems
in
use
today
is
transmitted
from
generator
to
point
of
distribution
not
as
a
unit
on
a
single
transmission
line
but
on
three
physically
separate
lines.
in
other
words,
from
generator
to
point
of
distribution
point,
you
have
three
lines
not
one.
if
you
observe
power
lines
crisscrossing
the
country,
you
will
notice
they
come
in
sets
of
three
that
is
because
there
are
three
separate
lines
coming
out
the
generator.
now,
the
power
in
each
line
is
not
steady
but
pulses
back
and
forth.
now,
the
pulses
in
the
three
lines,
in
the
three
separate
lines,
are
not
in
phase.
by
that
i
mean,
on
the
first
line
the
power
maybe
pulsing
forward
when
on
the
second
line
the
power
is
changing
in
direction
and
on
the
third
line
the
power
is
pulsing
backwards.
in
reference
to
exhibit
59
at
page
241
of
the
appendix,
gives
diagrams
of
the
actual
power
curves
and
by
studying
those
diagrams
you
can
see
graphically
what
i
am
describing
here.
in
short,
modern
systems
use
what
is
called
as
three-phase
power
with
each
phase
being
transmitted
separately
from
generation
all
the
way
to
the
distribution
point
thus
buses
which
i
discussed
before
as
the
junction
device
for
joining
transmission
lines
really
does
not
consist
of
one
conductive
bar
but
consists
of
three
conductive
bars,
one
bar
for
each
phase
in
three-phase
power.
now,
the
problem
that
persons
attempting
to
trace
power
flows
have
is
this,
commercial
meters
do
not
measure
what
actually
takes
place
from
instant
to
instant
in
each
phase.
instead,
they
merely
record
the
average
power
flow
in
all
three
phases
considered
together
but
this
is
not
a
fact
because
the
power
flows
are
separated,
if
you
would
adjoin
together
the
three
phases
you
would
have
a
short
circuit.
thus,
reliance
solely
on
meters,
reliance
solely
on
commercial
meter
readings
will
lead
you
to
conclude
that
over
a
given
period
of
time,
power
on
any
part
of
a
system
is
constant
in
direction
and
magnitude.
well,
this
is
not
the
fact,
the
engineering
fact
is
that
power
is
transmitted
in
three
phases
and
then
on
each
phase
the
power
pulses
back
and
forth.
staff
witness
dr.
jessel
testified
at
some
length
that
in
using
the
meter
readings
for
tracing
purposes,
the
treatment
of
a
bus
as
a
point
to
allow
for
commingling
was
appropriate
to
take
into
account
the
physical
reality
of
what
happens
in
each
phase
of
a
three-phase
bus.
now,
the
references
to
his
testimony
which
have
to
be,
his
testimony
has
to
be
studied
carefully
in
relation
to
the
exhibits
on
this
matter,
for
it
is
fairly
technical
but
the
references
to
his
testimony
are
listed
in
our
brief
at
page
13,
are
particularly
like
to
draw
the
courts
attention
to
his
testimony
at
pages
142
to
145
and
149
to
153
of
the
appendix
and
exhibit
61
which
is
at
page
243
of
the
appendix,
i
think
a
study
of
these
exhibits
show
that
dr.
jessel
was
able
to
demonstrate
that
power
entering
a
bus
on
a
single
phase
would
at
times
contribute
to
the
power
flowing
out
of
the
bus
on
all
other
lines,
flowing
out
from
that
phase.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
the
explanation
scientifically
your
honor
is
that,
it
is
unavoidable.
this
is
an
effect
which
can
be
measured
by
using
scientific
instruments
by
using
oscillograph,
attaching
it
to
the
various
parts
of
a
phase,
you
can
show
that
the
power
coming
in
on
a
given
line
will
at
times
be
greater.
well,
if
you
would
turn
to
the
page
5
of
respondents
brief,
i
think
i
can
explain
on
this
diagram
here.
if
you
consider
ab
there
to
be
a
single-phase
of
the
bus,
in
other
words
it
is
a
conductive
bar
joining
together,
let
us
say,
all
the
phase
as
of
various
transmission
lines.
now,
respondent
claims
that
power
from
g3,
the
generator
at
the
extreme
right
could
never
serve
l1
because
l2
being
a
10
kilowatt
load
is
greater
than
the
five
kilowatt
generating
power
coming
out
of
g3.
now
i
think,
in
reference
to
dr.
jessel's
testimony
shows
that
his
testimony
is
that
if
you
compare
the
power
curves
of
g3,
l2,
and
l1
or
just
g3
and
l2,
you
can
show
that
at
instance
during
each
cycle,
there
will
be
an
instant
or
more
than
one
instant
when
the
power
coming
out
of
g3
will
be
greater
than
the
power
being
consumed
by
l2.
exhibit
61,
which
i
will
not
go
into
now,
but
exhibit
61
keyed
in
to
dr.
jessel's
testimony
does
show
how
this
can
be
shown
graphically.
furthermore,
the
respondent
introduced
an
exhibit
in
which
he
attempted
to
show
that
converse
and
dr.
jessel
testified
with
respect
to
that
exhibit
that
you
could
verify
experimentally
that
power
did
in
fact
in
each
phase,
did
in
fact
go
over
an
intervening
lines
so
that
it
might
flow
out
on
other
lines.
dr.
jessel
was
questioned
extensively
on
these
exhibits
and
these
testimony
by
the
hearing
examiner
and
we
submit
that
the
hearing
examiner
was
in
a
very
good
position
to
probe
the
validity
of
his
assumptions
underlying
these
tracing
methods.
the
examiner's
conclusion
that
the
treatment
of
a
bus
as
a
point
did
indeed
appropriately
reflect
the
actual
dynamics,
the
physical
reality
of
three-phase
power
transmission
in
out
view
is
completely
sound.
in
conclusion,
we
urge
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
portion
my
time.
mr.
samuel
huntington
i
feel
he
did.
yes,
this
is
no
theory.
this
was
by
attaching
in
a
oscillograph
which
measures
the
power
curve
and
can
show
which
direction
at
any
given
instant
power
is
flowing
in
the
line,
he
said
by
hooking
these
up
to
the
various
parts
of
a
single
phase
of
a
bus,
you
could
show
that
power
coming
in
on
one
line
at
instances
was
contributing
to
the
power
flowing
out
on
other
lines.
mr.
samuel
huntington
yes,
certainly.
yes,
it
is
the—
mr.
samuel
huntington
that
kind
of
evidence,
we
are
saying
that
it
is
a
substantial
basis
for
the
conclusion
that
the
commingling
method
is
appropriate
way
of
tracing—
mr.
samuel
huntington
well
i
think
looking
at
this
testimony
will
show
you
that
he
did
proved
this,
that
there
was
expert
testimony
the
other
way
but
of
course
that
is
to
be
resolved
by
the
commission.
mr.
samuel
huntington
yes,
florida
power
corporation
is
a
public
utility
that
was
florida
power
corporation
was
before
this
court,
in
the
gainesville
case
at
402
u.s.
just
last
term
on
a
interconnection
matter.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
no,
the
interconnection
was
affected.
well,
actually
history
of
the
interconnection
was
ordered
by
the
commission
back
in
the
war
as
an
emergency
interconnection
and
then
after
the
emergency
terminated
the
utilities
found,
it
was
in
their
mutual
interest
to
maintain
it.
now,
they
do
pay—
mr.
samuel
huntington
oh,
no.
the
utilities
can
interconnect
voluntarily,
the
power
commission
can
order
them
to
interconnect
under
certain
circumstances
but
there
is
nothing
to
stop
them
from
interconnecting
voluntarily.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
it
can
do
it
can
only
do
on
the
application
of
the
state
commission
or
the
application
of
the
authority.
mr.
samuel
huntington
oh,
yes,
on
a
proper
application
they
could
but
it
is
unlikely
that
florida
power
and
light
company
would
apply
for
such
an
interconnection.
but
to
get
back
to
the
question
about
the
terms
of
compensation,
they
do
pay
for
energy
which
flows
across
that
interconnection.
there
is
no
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
the
respondent
and
the
florida
power
corporation
disconnected?
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
then
i
suppose
florida
power
will
likely—
mr.
samuel
huntington
it
is
certainly
is
to
their
benefit.
the
reserve
situation
in
the
southern
florida
is
very
critical
these
days.
certainly,
these
interconnections
and
the
interconnections
with
other
florida
utilities
are
essential.
now,
if
they
were
to
break
all
these
interconnections
then
of
course
the
commission
jurisdictions
would
evaporate.
mr.
samuel
huntington
i
do
have
one
point
your
honor
just
one
reference
with
respect
to
reactive
power.
reactive
power,
the
commission
expert
did
not
testify
that
the
negative
blip
on
the
power
curve
is
reactive
power.
i
refer
the
court
to
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
first
of
all,
the
negative
blip
does
not
account
for
the
contribution
across
the
bus
to
other
lines
that
is
done
on
appositive
power
portion
in
a
cycle
i
have
refer
to
exhibit
61
for
that
and
on
for
the
difference
between
reactive
power
and
apparent
power
and
i
refer
the
court
to
a
151
to
152
and
page
174.
what
the
power
currents
used
by
dr.
jessel,
we
did
not
have
anything
to
do
with
reactive
power
and
so
it
is
completely
erroneous
to
equate
the
negative
blips
on
those
curves
with
reactive
power.
mr.
samuel
huntington
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
in
this
case
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
fifth
circuit
is
whether
respondent
owns
and
operates
facilities
for
the
transmission
of
electric
energy
in
interstate
commerce.
if
respondent
does,
then
it
is
a
“public
utility”
subject
to
the
commission’s
jurisdiction
under
section
201
of
the
federal
power
act.
under
section
201,
electric
energy
is
deemed
to
be
transmitted
in
interstate
commerce
if
“transmitted
from
a
state
and
consumed
at
any
point
outside
thereof.”
on
the
basis
of
an
extensive
record,
the
commission
concluded
that
electric
energy
was
indeed
transmitted
from
respondent’s
facilities
in
florida
and
consumed
out
of
state.
this
conclusion
was
based
independently,
one
on
analysis
of
the
independence
of
respondent
and
out
of
state
utilities
and
two
on
studies
introduced
by
the
commission
staff
showing
that
electric
power
flows
could
be
traced
from
respondent’s
facilities
to
an
out-of-state
utility.
before
turning
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
i
would
like
to
note
just
briefly
the
consequences
of
commission
jurisdiction.
the
only
immediate
consequence
in
this
case,
if
the
commission’s
order
is
upheld
by
this
court,
would
be
to
require
respondent
to
comply
with
the
commission's
uniform
system
of
account.
the
establishment
of
jurisdiction
however
would
also
subject
respondent's
future
wholesale
sales
of
electric
energy
to
commission
jurisdiction
and
also
would
enable
the
commission
under
certain
circumstances
to
what
a
respondent
could
interconnect
and
sell
electric
energy
to
other
utilities.
the
pertinent
facts
in
this
case
are
as
follows:
respondent
is
a
major
electric
utility,
it
is
the
largest
utility
in
florida
and
in
1965
ranked
ninth
in
the
nation
in
terms
of
revenues.
its
facilities
are
located
wholly
within
the
state
of
florida
and
serve
over
900,000
customers
--
six
of
them
were
wholesale
customers.
although,
none
of
its
facilities
extend
to
the
state
line,
respondent
is
interconnected
with
the
florida
power
corporation
and
the
florida
power
corporation
in
turn
is
interconnected
with
the
georgia
power
company
as
well
as
other
utilities
across
the
state
line.
in
addition
to
its
interconnection
with
the
florida
power
corporation,
respondent
is
interconnected
with
three
other
florida
utilities
and
these
five
florida
utilities
make
up
the
florida
operating
committee.
through
the
committee,
these
utilities
coordinate
the
installation
and
maintenance
of
generating
equipment.
they
share
generating
reserves
and
they
exchange
information
on
a
daily
basis
to
better
coordinate
their
operations.
by
these
activities
therefore
each
member
is
able
to
provide
its
customers
with
more
reliable
service.
as
i
mentioned
before,
the
florida
power
corporation
has
interconnections
across
the
state
line
with
the
georgia
power
company
and
these
two
companies
exchange
substantial
amounts
of
electric
energy
from
year
to
year.
all
of
the
utilities,
that
i
have
referred
to
thus
far
are
members
of
the
140-member
interconnected
systems
group,
a
group
of
interconnected
utilities
spanning
the
southeast
and
central
portions
of
the
united
states.
the
first
ground
of
the
commission's
finding
of
jurisdiction
in
this
case
was
based
on
an
analysis
of
respondents
operation
as
a
part
of
its
vast
interconnected
system.
as
the
commission
staff
expert
witness
testified,
all
our
140
members
of
the
interconnected
systems
group
and
indeed
all
interconnected
systems,
operate
in
synchronism
--
that
is
they
all
operate
at
precisely
the
same
frequency.
on
modern
systems
charges
as
current
is
supplied
as
alternating
current,
alternating
at
60
cycles
per
second.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
there
are
some
isolated
municipal
operations.
mr.
samuel
huntington
at
this
point
there
are
--
most
of
the
nation’s
facilities
are
interconnected,
yes.
mr.
samuel
huntington
every
utility
has
been
interconnected.
i
do
not
think
the
argument
does
not
go
quite
that
far
because
we
depend
upon
an
analysis
of
the
operations
by
reason
of
interconnection.
i
think
there
could
be—
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
i
do
not
think
necessarily
because
hence,
i
think
it
depends
to
some
extent
on
the
extent
to
which
the
operations
are
coordinated.
now
it
is
possible--
mr.
samuel
huntington
no,
it
is
possible
for
instance
to
have
an
interconnection
that
will
open
in
the
event
of
any
kind
of
disturbance.
now
that
situation
we
would
say
that
the
two
utilities
would
not
be
coordinated
so
as
to
provide
mutual
system
in
the
case—
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
it
might
be
such
an
interconnection
so
that
if
a
utility
wanted
to
purchase
power
from
the
other
utility
it
could
at
a
certain
rate
over
period
of
time
but
the
interconnection
would
not
be
strong
enough
to
allow
emergency
service
in
the
event
at
a
very
large
generating
unit
would
go
out
on
one
side
of
the
interconnection.
in
these
circumstances,
we
would
suggest
that
you
have
quite
a,
you
have
a
minimal
amount
of
coordination
between
utilities
and
you
certainly
do
not
have
the
situation
that
you
have.
mr.
samuel
huntington
it
is
not
the
usual
situation
now,
i
think
at
the
time
the
federal
power
act
was
enacted,
there
were
situations
where
you
had
a
limited
type
interconnections.
most
of
the
interconnections
in
this
country
today
allow
for
the
type
of
operations
that
we
are
describing
here.
mr.
samuel
huntington
that
being
too
well—
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
we
do
admit
that
yes
that
is
right,
that
there
will
be
certain
small
utilities
that
will
be
subject
to
the
commission’s
jurisdiction.
i
would
like
to
just
point
out—
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
municipals
are
not
covered.
they
are
exempted—
mr.
samuel
huntington
there
about
450
privately
owned
utilities
in
the
country
i
think,
or
about
350
of
them
are
public
utilities
subject
to
the
commission’s
jurisdiction
at
this
point.
there
would
be
some
additional
ones
which
would
become
public
utilities
and
our
theory
here
is
accepted
by
this
court.
i
would
like
to
just
point
out
that
the
constant—
mr.
samuel
huntington
yes,
but
the
exception
of
the
state
of
texas
which
is
isolated
has
no
interconnections
across
the
state
line,
but
virtually
every
other
large
utility,
well,
not
every
other,
but
certainly
most
large
utilities
are
subject
to
the
commission’s
jurisdictions.
with
respect
to
the
small
utilities,
i
would
like
to
just
point
out
that
the
consequences
of
jurisdiction
maybe
very
small
for
some
utilities.
without
reaching
the
question
as
to
whether
the
commissions
has
discretion
to
decline
to
exercise
jurisdiction
in
certain
circumstances.
the
commission
does
have
the
specific
authority
to
classify
utilities
and
to
prescribe
different
rules
depending
upon
the
class.
now
this
is
done
with
respect
to
the
commission’s
accounting
requirements,
the
commission
has
established
five
different
classes
of
utilities
based
on
their
revenues
with
very
specific
requirements
for
the
large
utilities
and
very
minimal
requirements
for
the
small
utilities.
so
in
the
event
that
a
relatively
small
utility
is
interconnected
to
the
interstate
grid
and
is
subject
to
the
commission’s
jurisdiction,
the
effect
on
that
utility
maybe
very
small,
the
effect
of
the
federal
jurisdiction.
well,
because
all
systems
operate
in
synchronism,
this
means
that
the
generators
connected
to
the
interstate
network,
all
operate
at
precisely
the
same
frequency
and
that
they
speed
up
and
slow
down
in
units.
and
all
electric
clocks
for
instance
attached
to
the
interstate
network
whether
it
be
in
saint
louis
or
miami,
will
keep
precisely
the
same
time.
now,
electric
energy
cannot
be
stored
so
that
the
total
generation
of
a
network
is
constantly
adjusting
to
meet
the
networks
total
load.
in
order
to
assure
that
each
utility
ultimately
produces
enough
power
to
supply
its
customers
and
any
obligation
it
might
have
to
neighboring
utilities
and
in
order
to
assure
that
frequency
is
maintained
as
closely
as
possible
at
60
cycles
per
second,
each
system
employs
what
is
known
as
high
line
control
with
frequency
bias.
now,
the
operation
of
high
line
control
with
frequency
bias
is
explained
in
some
detail
in
our
brief
and
i
do
not
plan
go
into
the
mechanics
of
it
here.
what
is
important
to
note
is
that
this
control
method,
under
this
control
method,
each
member
of
the
interconnected
systems
group
shares
in
the
burden
of
maintaining
network
frequency
as
closely
as
possible
to
60
cycles
per
second
and
under
the
control
method,
each
member
will
contribute
increased
generation
to
meet
an
emergency
on
another
members
system.
the
record
contains
a
dramatic
example
of
the
response
of
systems
comprising
this
interstate
network
to
an
emergency.
on
february
17th
,
1965
a
midwestern
utility
in
the
interconnected
systems
groups
suffered
a
generation
loss
of
580
megawatts.
this
loss
caused
a
drop
in
frequency
on
the
interconnected
system.
each
of
the
other
systems
including
respondent
reacted
automatically
to
make
up
the
deficiency.
respondent’s
contribution
as
shown
by
exhibits
in
the
record
was
to
increase
each
generation
by
eight
megawatts.
other
benefits
that
also
accrue
from
interconnected
operations
are
as
follows:
as
a
result
of
frequency
bias,
deviations
in
the
frequency
are
kept
to
a
minimum,
clocks
keep
better
time,
precision
industrial
operations
are
benefited,
speed
ups
and
slow
downs
of
generating
equipment
are
minimized,
and
as
a
result
the
inadvertent
exchange
of
energy
between
systems
is
also
minimized.
in
short,
the
evidence
before
the
commission
showed
that
respondent,
the
other
florida
utilities
and
the
other
members
of
interconnected
systems
group,
all
operates
interdependently.
all
the
components
of
their
respective
systems
are
bonded
together
electromagnetically.
that
is
as
an
engineering
fact,
the
components
are
tied
together
electrically
and
magnetically.
as
a
result,
the
occurrence
of
an
event
on
one
system
will
have
a
necessary
and
measurable
effect
in
other
systems.
in
a
thorough
and
clear
opinion,
the
hearing
examiner
concluded
that
the
cause
and
effect
relationship
among
respondent
and
the
out
of
state
utilities
constituted
the
interstate
transmission
of
electric
energy.
this
conclusion
was
approved
by
the
commission
and
we
believe
this
is
fully
supported
by
the
evidence
just
summarized
and
furthermore
is
consistent
with
the
scheme
of
regulation
adopted
by
congress
in
enacting
the
federal
power
act.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
that
now.
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
reveals
the
dual
concern
on
the
part
of
congress.
on
the
one
hand,
congress
recognized
the
increasing
tendency
to
interconnect
utilities
and
recognized
that
there
is
a
need
for
federal
leadership
in
coordinating
the
interconnection
of
these
utilities
and
coordinating
the
nation’s
power
facilities.
on
the
other
hand,
congress
made
clear
that
its
intention
not
do
unduly
interfere
with
the
authority
of
state
regulatory
commissions.
as
this
court
recognized
in
the
connecticut
light
and
power
case,
congress
resolved
these
competing
concerns
first
by
defining
the
terms
of
grant
of
federal
jurisdiction,
broadly
and
precisely,
employing
in
the
words
of
this
court
an
engineering
or
scientific
test.
second,
the
granted
jurisdiction
was
then
limited
by
exempting
certain
facilities
and
most
importantly
by
limiting
the
commission’s
rate
jurisdiction
to
sales
of
interstate
energy
at
wholesale.
now,
since
the
enactment
of
the
federal
power
act,
vast
interconnected
systems
have
replaced
relatively
modest
networks
and
the
interstate
nature
of
the
electric
industry
has
steadily
risen.
what
happens
on
one
part
of
a
network
can
have
a
dramatic
and
sometimes
catastrophic
effect
on
the
other
parts
of
the
network
as
is
happened
in
various
power
failures
in
the
last
few
years.
the
hearing
examiner
noted
the
1965
northeast
power
failure.
we
are
not
talking
here
about
some
remote
effect
on
commerce
such
as
you
might
be
discussing
in
terms
of
other
regulatory
statutes.
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
an
electrical
effect
throughout
a
common
network.
we
are
talking
about
an
engineering
fact
that
when
you
have
a
disturbance
on
one
system
it
causes
a
reaction
on
other
systems.
in
short,
we
submit
that
the
jurisdictional
test
adopted
by
congress
was
designed
to
and
is
capable
of
taking
into
account
the
complex
and
interdependent
nature
of
interconnected
electric
systems.
mr.
samuel
huntington
we
place
a
great
deal
of
reliance
on
this,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
huntington
no.
we
do
not
believe
so.
we
believe
the
language
of
statute
is
transmitted
in
interstate
commerce,
electric
energy
moving
from
moving
from
one
state
to
another.
now,
if
there
is
a
disturbance
in
one
state
such
as
a
loss
of
generating
equipment
and
if
the
other
states
contribute
by
plan
control
mechanism,
this
high
line
bias
with
frequency
control,
this
is
a
system
developed
in
the
last
ten
or
fifteen
years
which
was
not
in
effect
when
the
power
act
was
first
enacted.
if
true,
this
common
control
mechanism
signals
a
sent-out
to
the
other
systems
supply
extra
power
until
this
disturbance
is
cleared
up.
we
submit
that
this
is
a
transmission
of
electric
energy
that
the
cause
and
effect
relationship
here,
disturbance
plus
contribution
in
neighboring
systems
to
increase
generation
in
response
to
a
very
sophisticated
control
mechanism.
we
claim
that
this
does
constitute
the
jurisdictional
standard
and
engineering
fact
which
is
what
congress
had
in
mind
in
setting
forth
the
bounds
of
jurisdiction.
well,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
alternate
basis
for
commission
jurisdiction
which
is
completely
independent
from
the
basis
i
have
been
discussing
thus
far.
at
the
hearing
before
the
examiner,
the
commission’s
staff
introduced
studies
based
on
data
for
commercial
meters
which
show
that
at
times
during
1964,
electric
energy
flowed
from
the
georgia
power
company
to
respondent
over
the
facilities
at
the
florida
power
corporation
and
at
other
times
flowed
the
other
way.
respondents
attack
on
these
studies
focuses
on
the
staff’s
treatment
of
the
conducted
bars
used
to
join
together
transmission
lines.
these
bars
or
junction
points
are
known
as
buses.
what
the
staff
did
was
to
assume
that
energy
flowing
into
a
bus
on
two
or
more
transmission
lines
becomes
mixed
together
or
commingled,
thus
energy
flowing
out
of
the
bus
on
other
transmission
lines
would
be
commingled
energy.
that
is
would
include
energy
from
all
the
lines
entering
the
bus.
to
understand
the
basis
for
this
assumption,
some
background
is
necessary.
electric
energy
on
all
commercial
systems
in
use
today
is
transmitted
from
generator
to
point
of
distribution
not
as
a
unit
on
a
single
transmission
line
but
on
three
physically
separate
lines.
in
other
words,
from
generator
to
point
of
distribution
point,
you
have
three
lines
not
one.
if
you
observe
power
lines
crisscrossing
the
country,
you
will
notice
they
come
in
sets
of
three
that
is
because
there
are
three
separate
lines
coming
out
the
generator.
now,
the
power
in
each
line
is
not
steady
but
pulses
back
and
forth.
now,
the
pulses
in
the
three
lines,
in
the
three
separate
lines,
are
not
in
phase.
by
that
i
mean,
on
the
first
line
the
power
maybe
pulsing
forward
when
on
the
second
line
the
power
is
changing
in
direction
and
on
the
third
line
the
power
is
pulsing
backwards.
in
reference
to
exhibit
59
at
page
241
of
the
appendix,
gives
diagrams
of
the
actual
power
curves
and
by
studying
those
diagrams
you
can
see
graphically
what
i
am
describing
here.
in
short,
modern
systems
use
what
is
called
as
three-phase
power
with
each
phase
being
transmitted
separately
from
generation
all
the
way
to
the
distribution
point
thus
buses
which
i
discussed
before
as
the
junction
device
for
joining
transmission
lines
really
does
not
consist
of
one
conductive
bar
but
consists
of
three
conductive
bars,
one
bar
for
each
phase
in
three-phase
power.
now,
the
problem
that
persons
attempting
to
trace
power
flows
have
is
this,
commercial
meters
do
not
measure
what
actually
takes
place
from
instant
to
instant
in
each
phase.
instead,
they
merely
record
the
average
power
flow
in
all
three
phases
considered
together
but
this
is
not
a
fact
because
the
power
flows
are
separated,
if
you
would
adjoin
together
the
three
phases
you
would
have
a
short
circuit.
thus,
reliance
solely
on
meters,
reliance
solely
on
commercial
meter
readings
will
lead
you
to
conclude
that
over
a
given
period
of
time,
power
on
any
part
of
a
system
is
constant
in
direction
and
magnitude.
well,
this
is
not
the
fact,
the
engineering
fact
is
that
power
is
transmitted
in
three
phases
and
then
on
each
phase
the
power
pulses
back
and
forth.
staff
witness
dr.
jessel
testified
at
some
length
that
in
using
the
meter
readings
for
tracing
purposes,
the
treatment
of
a
bus
as
a
point
to
allow
for
commingling
was
appropriate
to
take
into
account
the
physical
reality
of
what
happens
in
each
phase
of
a
three-phase
bus.
now,
the
references
to
his
testimony
which
have
to
be,
his
testimony
has
to
be
studied
carefully
in
relation
to
the
exhibits
on
this
matter,
for
it
is
fairly
technical
but
the
references
to
his
testimony
are
listed
in
our
brief
at
page
13,
are
particularly
like
to
draw
the
courts
attention
to
his
testimony
at
pages
142
to
145
and
149
to
153
of
the
appendix
and
exhibit
61
which
is
at
page
243
of
the
appendix,
i
think
a
study
of
these
exhibits
show
that
dr.
jessel
was
able
to
demonstrate
that
power
entering
a
bus
on
a
single
phase
would
at
times
contribute
to
the
power
flowing
out
of
the
bus
on
all
other
lines,
flowing
out
from
that
phase.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
the
explanation
scientifically
your
honor
is
that,
it
is
unavoidable.
this
is
an
effect
which
can
be
measured
by
using
scientific
instruments
by
using
oscillograph,
attaching
it
to
the
various
parts
of
a
phase,
you
can
show
that
the
power
coming
in
on
a
given
line
will
at
times
be
greater.
well,
if
you
would
turn
to
the
page
5
of
respondents
brief,
i
think
i
can
explain
on
this
diagram
here.
if
you
consider
ab
there
to
be
a
single-phase
of
the
bus,
in
other
words
it
is
a
conductive
bar
joining
together,
let
us
say,
all
the
phase
as
of
various
transmission
lines.
now,
respondent
claims
that
power
from
g3,
the
generator
at
the
extreme
right
could
never
serve
l1
because
l2
being
a
10
kilowatt
load
is
greater
than
the
five
kilowatt
generating
power
coming
out
of
g3.
now
i
think,
in
reference
to
dr.
jessel's
testimony
shows
that
his
testimony
is
that
if
you
compare
the
power
curves
of
g3,
l2,
and
l1
or
just
g3
and
l2,
you
can
show
that
at
instance
during
each
cycle,
there
will
be
an
instant
or
more
than
one
instant
when
the
power
coming
out
of
g3
will
be
greater
than
the
power
being
consumed
by
l2.
exhibit
61,
which
i
will
not
go
into
now,
but
exhibit
61
keyed
in
to
dr.
jessel's
testimony
does
show
how
this
can
be
shown
graphically.
furthermore,
the
respondent
introduced
an
exhibit
in
which
he
attempted
to
show
that
converse
and
dr.
jessel
testified
with
respect
to
that
exhibit
that
you
could
verify
experimentally
that
power
did
in
fact
in
each
phase,
did
in
fact
go
over
an
intervening
lines
so
that
it
might
flow
out
on
other
lines.
dr.
jessel
was
questioned
extensively
on
these
exhibits
and
these
testimony
by
the
hearing
examiner
and
we
submit
that
the
hearing
examiner
was
in
a
very
good
position
to
probe
the
validity
of
his
assumptions
underlying
these
tracing
methods.
the
examiner's
conclusion
that
the
treatment
of
a
bus
as
a
point
did
indeed
appropriately
reflect
the
actual
dynamics,
the
physical
reality
of
three-phase
power
transmission
in
out
view
is
completely
sound.
in
conclusion,
we
urge
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
portion
my
time.
mr.
samuel
huntington
i
feel
he
did.
yes,
this
is
no
theory.
this
was
by
attaching
in
a
oscillograph
which
measures
the
power
curve
and
can
show
which
direction
at
any
given
instant
power
is
flowing
in
the
line,
he
said
by
hooking
these
up
to
the
various
parts
of
a
single
phase
of
a
bus,
you
could
show
that
power
coming
in
on
one
line
at
instances
was
contributing
to
the
power
flowing
out
on
other
lines.
mr.
samuel
huntington
yes,
certainly.
yes,
it
is
the—
mr.
samuel
huntington
that
kind
of
evidence,
we
are
saying
that
it
is
a
substantial
basis
for
the
conclusion
that
the
commingling
method
is
appropriate
way
of
tracing—
mr.
samuel
huntington
well
i
think
looking
at
this
testimony
will
show
you
that
he
did
proved
this,
that
there
was
expert
testimony
the
other
way
but
of
course
that
is
to
be
resolved
by
the
commission.
mr.
samuel
huntington
yes,
florida
power
corporation
is
a
public
utility
that
was
florida
power
corporation
was
before
this
court,
in
the
gainesville
case
at
402
u.s.
just
last
term
on
a
interconnection
matter.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
no,
the
interconnection
was
affected.
well,
actually
history
of
the
interconnection
was
ordered
by
the
commission
back
in
the
war
as
an
emergency
interconnection
and
then
after
the
emergency
terminated
the
utilities
found,
it
was
in
their
mutual
interest
to
maintain
it.
now,
they
do
pay—
mr.
samuel
huntington
oh,
no.
the
utilities
can
interconnect
voluntarily,
the
power
commission
can
order
them
to
interconnect
under
certain
circumstances
but
there
is
nothing
to
stop
them
from
interconnecting
voluntarily.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
it
can
do
it
can
only
do
on
the
application
of
the
state
commission
or
the
application
of
the
authority.
mr.
samuel
huntington
oh,
yes,
on
a
proper
application
they
could
but
it
is
unlikely
that
florida
power
and
light
company
would
apply
for
such
an
interconnection.
but
to
get
back
to
the
question
about
the
terms
of
compensation,
they
do
pay
for
energy
which
flows
across
that
interconnection.
there
is
no
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
the
respondent
and
the
florida
power
corporation
disconnected?
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
then
i
suppose
florida
power
will
likely—
mr.
samuel
huntington
it
is
certainly
is
to
their
benefit.
the
reserve
situation
in
the
southern
florida
is
very
critical
these
days.
certainly,
these
interconnections
and
the
interconnections
with
other
florida
utilities
are
essential.
now,
if
they
were
to
break
all
these
interconnections
then
of
course
the
commission
jurisdictions
would
evaporate.
mr.
samuel
huntington
i
do
have
one
point
your
honor
just
one
reference
with
respect
to
reactive
power.
reactive
power,
the
commission
expert
did
not
testify
that
the
negative
blip
on
the
power
curve
is
reactive
power.
i
refer
the
court
to
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
first
of
all,
the
negative
blip
does
not
account
for
the
contribution
across
the
bus
to
other
lines
that
is
done
on
appositive
power
portion
in
a
cycle
i
have
refer
to
exhibit
61
for
that
and
on
for
the
difference
between
reactive
power
and
apparent
power
and
i
refer
the
court
to
a
151
to
152
and
page
174.
what
the
power
currents
used
by
dr.
jessel,
we
did
not
have
anything
to
do
with
reactive
power
and
so
it
is
completely
erroneous
to
equate
the
negative
blips
on
those
curves
with
reactive
power.
