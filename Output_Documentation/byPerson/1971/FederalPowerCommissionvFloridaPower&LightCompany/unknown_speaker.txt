unknown
speaker
but
suppose,
i
do
not
know
what
this
record
shows
but
is
this
the
same?
it
is
hardly
a
generating
electric
system,
i
noted
that
it
is
not
somehow
interconnected
with
others
in
this
grid
pattern?
unknown
speaker
that
is
quite
actually
contrary.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
the
government's
argument
in
this
case
going
to
take
this
so
far
as
to
say,
this
means
that
the
federal
power
commission
now
has
regulatory
authority
over
virtually
every
--
unknown
speaker
what
i
am
trying
to
get
at
necessarily
though
would
be
argument
should
go
in
that
analysis
that
brings
to
that
result.
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
suggesting
at
the
wrong
result—
unknown
speaker
oh
then,
i
asked
you,
how
often
if
that
is
the
case?
is
it
not
a
usual
situation
or
the—
unknown
speaker
well
that
being
too—
unknown
speaker
if
we
agree
with
the
government
in
this
case.
i
am
not
saying
this
is
wrong,
that
really
is
going
to
mean
that
federal
power
commission
has
regulatory
authority
but
over
virtually
every
electric
--
unknown
speaker
part
of
this
deal
is
the
geographical
contours
in
the
state
of
florida,
and
here
is
florida
power
and
light
in
a
peninsular
state.
i
take
it
from
much
you
just
said,
most
other
large
utilities
in
this
country
today
are
subject
to
fpc
jurisdiction
as
a
public
utility.
unknown
speaker
mr.
samuel
huntington,
this
is
very
parallel
to
hydrodynamics,
does
not
the
permeation
of
water
to
water,
can
it
be
proved,
actually
proved,
i
take
it
do
you
feel
that
dr.
jessel
did?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
is
not
that
sufficient
evidence
to
support
the
federal
power
commission
assumptions
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
it
can
be
proved,
or
was
it
proved
or
anything
else,
i
think
in
colton,
we
set
that
kind
of
evidence
was
out
of—
unknown
speaker
remembering
colton,
what
is
the
proof?
unknown
speaker
incidentally,
is
florida
power
corporation
subject
to
a
jurisdiction
of
the—
unknown
speaker
the
florida
power
may
take
--
florida
power
corporation
or
something
in
the
interconnection.
does
that
subject
to
the
fpc
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
does
florida
power
corporation
need
any
consent
in
a
federal
power
commission
to
interconnect--
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
application?
unknown
speaker
how
did
the
florida
power
corporation
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
what
if
florida
power
corporation
said
that
we
do
not
want
to
be
connected?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
that
if
the
fpl
had
the
same
connection
across
the
georgia
line
and
that
florida
power
had,
you
would
conceive
the
commission
at
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
yes,
so
you
had
a
direct
connection
with
some
corporative
company
across
the
line,
that
would
be
no
question.
unknown
speaker
since
the
intervention
of
florida
power
between
--
unknown
speaker
a
larger
company
with
more
bigger
or
higher
load.
unknown
speaker
so
thus,
you
are
saying
that
never
and
it
is
just
necessarily
does
not
do
fpl
any
good
at
all
that
florida
power
is
connected
to
other
states.
unknown
speaker
we
cannot
depend
on
it
but
could
it
ever
happen
that
if
your
capacity
went
out
and
you
have
to
draw
on
florida
power,
that
florida
power
would
be
giving
you
energy
from
across
straight
line.
unknown
speaker
if
they
had
to
give
--
unknown
speaker
you
can
conceive
these
are
there?
you
were
really
using
energy
from
across
state
lines
through
the
intermediary
of
florida
power
that
you
nevertheless
are
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
commission.
unknown
speaker
would
that
be
true
if
it
ever
could
happen?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
arranging
it
so
that
it
could
happen?
unknown
speaker
are
your
engineering
structure
arrangements
such,
that
you
are
equipped
to
receive
energy
from
georgia?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
gather
the
commission’s
theory
is
all
premised
on
the
the
expert
evidence?
unknown
speaker
i
thought,
the
actual.
well
let
me
put
it
to
you,
did
the
commission
try
to
prove
through
the
expert
testimony,
actual
flow?
unknown
speaker
and
did
they
conclude
that
they
had
it
based
on
that
expert
testimony?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
i
am
trying
to
get
at,
in
what
position
are
we
or
was
the
fifth
circuit
for
that
matter?
unknown
speaker
suppose
that
would
be
particularly
relevant
in
case
wholesale
rates
were
an
issue
here?
unknown
speaker
this
is
the
ultimate
thrust
of
the
decision
of
the
power
commission
decision
does
not
control
of
a
wholesale
rate?
unknown
speaker
to
sense
all
of
this,
but
if
they
win
this
case,
then
the
next
case
would
be
wholesale
rates?
unknown
speaker
well
let
me
get
it
straight
on
the
--
does
the
commission
claim
that
if
you
have
jurisdiction
or
is
it
a
government
claim
to
have
jurisdiction,
if
the
only
time
power
might
flow
to
fpl
from
across
state
lines
as
is
an
emergency
when
some
of
fpl's
equipment
was
out
or
is
on
their
theory
that
this
flow
back
and
forth
is
flowing
on
all
the
time?
unknown
speaker
just
flowing
through
all
the
time.
unknown
speaker
was
that
an
emergency
situation
where
some
of
the
equipment
was
down?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
let
me
if
i
understand
that
what
you
are
telling,
do
you
agree
that
every
120th
cycle,
there
is
a
reverse
blip.
unknown
speaker
but
you
say
that
reverse
blip
is
not
electrical
energy
--
that
is
something
called
reactive
power.
unknown
speaker
and
therefore
it
cannot
be
a
measure
of
whether
or
not
this
transmission
in
the
interstate
of
commerce
of
electric
energy.
unknown
speaker
again
i
have
to
define.
this
been
the
fight
of
each
among
between
the
expert
on
each
side
to
this
and
before
the
commission.
unknown
speaker
are
you
speaking
of
all
the
experts
who
testified
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
mr.
giller
that
the
experts
for
the
commission
position
did
not
say
that
the
reverse
flow
involved
a
flow
of
electric
energy.
is
that
what
you
are
telling
us?
unknown
speaker
if
i
may,
so
far
i
guess,
we
have
just
been
talking
of
one
position
that
the
commission
has.
unknown
speaker
there
was
reason,
because
your
time
is
running
and
i
would
like
to
hear
you
on
the
other
again.
unknown
speaker
what
page?
unknown
speaker
they
testified
was
electric
energy?
unknown
speaker
but
suppose,
i
do
not
know
what
this
record
