unknown
speaker
where
is
lansing?
unknown
speaker
north
of
chicago?
unknown
speaker
about
50
miles
south
of
chicago?
unknown
speaker
that
is
jones,
delbert
jones?
unknown
speaker
they
said
“do
you
know
who
is
slick?”
unknown
speaker
didn't
you
say
do
you
know
lyman
moore?
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
--james
e.
watts
has
a
nickname
slick?
unknown
speaker
well,
was
he
in
prison
at
the
time
of
the
trial?
unknown
speaker
and
when
was
the
time?
unknown
speaker
and
the
statement
had
to
given
after
that?
unknown
speaker
so,
this
fellow
slick
must
have
been
the
copy
of
about
a
different
crime?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that
at
majority
everything
you
told
us
so
far,
you
telling
us
as
information
that
was
not
available
to
defense
counsel
at
the
trial.
unknown
speaker
and
none
of
this
what
you
are
talking
about
got
in
to
evidence
at
the
prior
of
trial,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
yes
and
your
argument
is
that
this
was
information.
perhaps,
exculpatory
or
nothing
of
moore.
now
that
the
prosecution
should
have
made
available
to
the
defense
counsel.
unknown
speaker
even
though,
and
you
also
telling
us
defense
counsel
had
no
knowledge
of
any
of
these
things
at
the
time
of
trial?
unknown
speaker
no,
what
i
want
to
know
is
are
you
telling
us
that
the
defense
council
had
no
knowledge
of
any
of
this
things
at
the
time
of
trial?
unknown
speaker
and
you
tell
us
earlier
that
you
say
the
name
was
sanders?
unknown
speaker
it
was
virgle
sander’s
testimony
that
identified
moore
as
slick
who
committed
this.
unknown
speaker
before
we
get
to
anything
further,
i
am
not
clear
about
this
sanders
testified
as
per
the
talk
that
he
was
the
present
in
the
tavern
where
they
brag
that
made
that
i
killed
somebody
in
lansing.
is
that
right?
and
then,
he
then
identified
moore
as
that
somebody
who
in
that
tavern
bragged
that
he
had
killed
someone
in
lansing.
unknown
speaker
did
moore's
attorneys
know
where
he
was?
unknown
speaker
they
did
not
attempt
to
impeach
sanders.
unknown
speaker
the
statement
is
what
had
referred
to
the
first
meeting
on
november
1,
1961.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
when
they
first
interviewed
the
man,
they
took
a
statement
about
sometime
before
the
trial?
unknown
speaker
how
long
before
the
trial?
unknown
speaker
and
you
had
no
access
to
that
statement
until
1967
as
a
post-conviction?
unknown
speaker
but
you
did
not
have
--
unknown
speaker
so
defense
counsel
did
not
know
that
sanders
had
told
the
police
that
sanders
has
met
slick
six
months
before?
unknown
speaker
mr.
doherty,
did
moore's
defense
lawyers
at
the
trial
cross
examine
sanders
on
the
length
of
time
he
had
known
the
defendant
and
that
sort
of
thing?
unknown
speaker
they
might
have
developed
this
on
their
own
i
take
it
had
they
thought
to
cross
examine.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
a
calculated
risk
but
some
would
have
felt
it
was
--
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
prosecutor
knew
about
sander's
prior
statement
when
they
turned
the
file,
their
file
over
to
the
defendant
trial
counsel?
unknown
speaker
what?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
but
did
the
prosecution
turn
its
file
over
or
not
at
the
trial?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say
no,
but
let
us
assume
that
that
is
not
right
that
they
did
turn
that
file.
unknown
speaker
the
fact
is
that
the
sanders
statement
was
not
in
the
file.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understand
that
but
i
am
just
trying
to
enquire
about
this
one
item.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
the
prosecution
testified
that
they
turned
the
file
over,
did
not
they?
unknown
speaker
and
what
did
the
supreme
court
–
what
did
the
state
court
fiind?
unknown
speaker
so,
they
did
turn
the
file
over?
unknown
speaker
the
court
found
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
is
no
independent
evidence
anywhere
that
the
prosecution
knew
of
the
statement
by
sanders,
is
there?
how
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
because
that
was
in
their
file
or
not?
unknown
speaker
so,
the
file
did
not
contain
the
statement
here
and
it
was
then
deliberately
withheld.
unknown
speaker
if
you
are
going
to
rely
on
the
statement
you
have
to
–[crosstalk]
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that
but
you
are
relying
on
that
as
part
of
the
trial.
unknown
speaker
and
this
is
not
going
to
--
if
they
did
not
get
it.
they
did
not.
unknown
speaker
mr.
doherty,
your
time
is
running,
when
are
you
going
to
get
to
the
gun.
unknown
speaker
as
to
when
and
who
said
it?
unknown
speaker
this
gun
was
used
in
evidence
against
the
--
unknown
speaker
moore
twice
for
different?
unknown
speaker
unrelated?
unknown
speaker
one
of
which
the
gun
was
used
and
the
other
which
was
not?
unknown
speaker
no,
i
mean
the
gun
was
use
in
the
commission
of
the
alleged
into
the
commission
of
the
--
unknown
speaker
this
in
fact
that
did
not
occur
in
the
same
night
--
unknown
speaker
then
how
do
you
mean
the
same
alibi?
unknown
speaker
same
place?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
he
is
not
considered
to
know
about
the
statement
before
at
the
time
--
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
did
you,
back
in
1962?
unknown
speaker
i
just
wonder
since
you
had
the
rule,
the
witness
almost
seeing
that
the
prosecutor
is
apparently
trying
to
find
out
whether
the
witness
is
trying
to
mean,
he
had
made
any
statement.
unknown
speaker
well,
my
question
is
really
why
i
should
propose,
as
a
routine
when
they
get
together
in
the
library
with
the
witnesses
he
was
trying
to
use
and
then
he
might,
he
is
going
to
use
them
in
some
inquiry,
whether
he
had
made
any
statement?
the
prosecutor
would
like
to
say
to
him,
did
you
make
any
statement,
did
he
find
any?
unknown
speaker
mr.
immel
do
you
think
he
get
the
--
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
you
get
to
the
--
unknown
speaker
he
kept
this
inside?
unknown
speaker
not
this
murder?
unknown
speaker
where
is
lansing?
unknown
speaker
north
of
chicago?
unknown
speaker
about
50
miles
south
of
chicago?
unknown
speaker
that
is
jones,
delbert
jones?
unknown
speaker
they
said
“do
you
know
who
is
slick?”
unknown
speaker
didn't
you
say
do
you
know
lyman
moore?
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
--james
e.

has
a
nickname
slick?
unknown
speaker
well,
was
he
in

at
the
