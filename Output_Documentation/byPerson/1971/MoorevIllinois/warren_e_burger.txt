was
there
anything
at
the
time
of
trial
--
now
i
am
putting
you
in
the
time
of
trial,
was
there
anything
at
the
time
of
trial
to
bring
to
the
notice
of
the
prosecutors
that
the
six
months
factor
was
significant?
none
of
you
really
knew
that
until
the
post-conviction
hearing
did
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
my
question
does
a
little
beyond
that
and

is,
i
will
put
it
in
another
way.
until
you
developed
the
information
about
this
man
being
in
prison
until
what
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
until
that
evidence
came
out,
the
six
months
statement
did
not
have
any
particular
significance
did
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
whether
you
are
speaking
now
was
the
police
officers
who
have
the
interview
rather
than
the
prosecutor
are
you
not?
i
am
just
trying
to
get
the
difference
of
between
what
was
known
to
the
prosecutor
and
what
was
known
to
the
police.
we
do
not
know
yet
whether
that
is
important.

the
time.

justice
warren
e.

what
he
