mr.
thomas
j.
immel
mr.
chief
justice,
and
members
of
the
court.
i
would
like
to
say
as
a
prosecutor
from
the
state
of
illinois
that
as
the
evidence
in
this
case
remotely
resembled
the
characterization
which
has
been
described
to,
and
my
colleague
and
friend.
i
would
not
have
the
courage
to
stand
before
this
court
this
morning.
counsel
has
been
involved
in
this
case
for
considerable
length
of
time
and
my
fair
judgment
as
a
attorney
he
is
more
than
a
legend.
and
for
that
reason
i
am
going
to
take
the
liberty
of
restating
the
facts
as
i
truly
think
they
are
reflected
in
the
record.
and
i
only
turn
the
court
to
april
25,
1962
when
a
gentleman
who
i
contend
was
lyman
moore
and
a
companion
who
was
a
dark
haired
man
wearing
a
mustache
went
into
a
tavern
in
lansing
and
where
the
petitioner
lyman
moore
was
subsequently
objected
for
profane
language
who
returned
approximately
one
hour
later
and
at
time
later
shot
gun
across
the
bar
and
terminated
mr.
bernard
zitek.
now,
not
mentioned
this
morning
at
all
is
the
fact
that
two
people,
one
the
cocktail
waitress
patricia
hill
from
a
distance
of
six
feet
observed
this
whole
incident
twice.
she
observed
the
ejection,
she
observed
the
subsequent
shooting
an
hour
later
and
she
said
at
trial
the
lyman
moore
was
the
gun
man.
lyman
moore
was
the
man
who
ejected
an
hour
earlier.
another
patron
of
the
tavern,
a
man
by
the
name
of
henley
powell
was
present
in
the
tavern
at
the
time
that
the
shooting
took
place.
he
is
not
able
to
tell
us
whether
moore
was
the
man
ejected
from
the
tavern,
he
may
not
even
have
been
there
at
that
time
but
henley
powell
was
playing
pinochle
with
a
few
other
gentlemen
around
the
table
and
his
testimony
is
pertinent
in
another
point
here.
playing
pinochle,
severed
the
fate
of
many
pinochle
players
he
cannot
beat,
so
he
lays
his
hand
down.
he
is
sitting
out
of
the
the
hand
and
he
looks
toward
the
door
and
what
does
he
observe
that
lyman
moore,
who
he
identifies
at
the
trial,
come
through
the
door
carrying
a
shotgun,
walk
up
to
the
bar
and
killed
the
bartender
mr.
zitek.
henley
powell
pursued
lyman
moore
out
of
the
tavern
and
was
confronted
with
him
in
a
well
lighted
street
where
upon
lyman
moore
told
henley
powell
according
to
mr.
henley
powell
“get
back
or
i
kill
you
too.”
now,
these
two
people
were
not
discussed
this
morning
but
this
was
the
state's
case
and
chief,
this
was
the
eyewitness
to
the
killing.
now,
two
days
later
in
another
tavern
call
the
ponderosa
tavern
no
way
related
to
the
tavern
where
the
killing
takes
place,
vigle
sanders
is
having
a
beer
with
the
gentlemen
who
he
at
the
time
is
identifying
as
slick
and
at
trial
says
he
knew
as
slick
and
this
gentleman
says
to
him,
“it
is
open
season
on
bartenders,
i
shot
one
over
in
lansing.”
now,
totally
unmentioned
in
any
the
petitioner's
brief
and
not
mentioned
here
this
morning
is,
there
were
a
couple
of
other
people
there
when
that
conversation
took
place.
one
of
whom
was
the
bartender,
skinhead
joyce.
now,
skinhead
is
standing
behind
the
bar
and
vigle
sanders
approaches
him
and
said,
“this
gentleman
would
like
to
have
a
ride
over
to
harvey,
can
we
arrange
that?”
and
mr.
skinhead
moore,
joyce
rather
testifies
at
trial
that,
“yes,
he
arranged
for
the
ride
that
lyman
moore
was
the
man
in
the
bar
conversing
with
virgle
sanders.
now,
they
need
to
get
a
ride
from
mr.
moore
who
they
contacted,
they
contacted
the
owner
of
ponderosa
who
is
also
in
the
tavern
at
the
time
and
he
says,
“can
you
arrange
for
a
lift
for
this
fellow
here?”
and
his
companion
who
again
by
the
way
is
the
dark
haired
man
wearing
a
mustache,
same
description
we
have
of
the
companion
of
moore
at
the
time
he
is
ejected
from
the
tavern,
okay.
what
happens
then?
mr.
fair
accommodates
these
two
gentlemen
and
drives
them
all
the
way
to
harvey,
in
the
course
of
which
they
stopped
twice
in
two
different
tavern
and
enjoyed
themselves
as
companions.
now,
mr.
fair
testifies
at
trial
that
lyman
moore
is
the
man
that
he
accommodated
and
he
is
the
man
who
is
the
ponderosa
and
he
is
the
man
he
drove
to
harvey.
and
that
furthermore
in
the
course
of
their
automobile
ride
and
this
time
his
testimony
he
is
referring
to
them
as
moore
and
barbee,
because
they
are
on
the
first
name
basis
at
this
point
or
second
name
basis
and
i
knew
that.
at
this
point
he
says
during
the
course
of
the
automobile
ride
one
of
them
and
it
is
not
clear
from
the
record
which
said,
“if
we
have
to
have
that
trouble
with
that
bartender
in
lansing
we
would
be
in
this
spot,”
testimony
that
of
fair,
“well,
if
we
had
to
have
a
trouble
with
the
bartender
in
lansing
we
had
been
alright,”
that
is
what
he
said.
now,
mr.
fair
was
called
to
testify
at
trial
and
he
testified
that
lyman
moore
was
the
man
that
went
from
him
from
the
ponderosa,
after
he
request
of
joyce,
the
bartender
and
he
is
the
man
that
he
drove
to
harvey.
now,
that
tells
me
that
virgle
sanders
statement
that
lyman
moore
was
in
ponderosa
with
him
has
been
corroborated
and
that
any
misidentification
or
confusion
of
identities
that
virgle
sanders
is
subsequently
trapped
with
because
of
his
murky
recollections
of
phantom
named
slick
was
yet
to
be
underground
by
anybody
and
the
police
obviously
abandoned
once
they
had
three,
two
eyewitnesses
to
the
killing
and
three
witnesses
to
the
brag.
it
tells
me
that
vigle
sanders
testimony
is
accurate,
insofar
as
it
purports
to
reflect
the
conversation
that
he
had
with
lyman
moore
and
that
it
is
inaccurate
insofar
as
he
purports
to
tell
us
that
lyman
moore
and
a
fellow
by
name
is
slick
are
same
people,
they
are
not,
slick
was
a
--
if
lyman
moore
is
slick
it
is
impossible.
slick
is
a
fellow
that
this
gentleman
sanders
met
in
wanda
and
del’s
back
in
november
sometime
i
suppose
in
1961.
lyman
moore
is
in
the
federal
penitentiary
that
time,
a
bank
robbery
charge.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
no,
he
did
not
know.
neither
one
of
them
testified
to
the
contents
of
the
conversation.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
neither
joyce
or
mr.
fair
who
corroborate
--
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
only
sanders
testifies
as
to
what
was
said
and
that
has
never
been
questioned.
mr.
doherty
today
is
asserting
that
that
statement
was
simply
made
by
another
man
not
that
the
statement
was
not
made.
the
verbiage
of
the
conversation
is
beyond
dispute.
what
is
undisputed
is
that
who
said
it,
i
do
not
think
it
is
undisputed,
i
think
it
is
perfectly
clear
from
the
records
themselves.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
no,
it
was
said
in
the
ponderosa
tap
and
there
is
no
dispute
up
to
that,
it
was
said,
two
day
later
on
april
27,
1962
no
dispute.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
he
said
that
the
man
he
was
in
the
ponderosa
with
who
he
knew
as
slick
made
it.
now,
the
man
he
was
in
ponderosa
with
was
lyman
moore
and
slick
was
ever
there.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
a
man
he
knew
as
slick.
he
mixed
up
lyman.
he
evidently
met
slick
in
wanda
and
del’s
and
everybody
down
at
wanda
and
del’s
seems
to
know
slick
and
so
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
this
gentleman
would
have
not
met
slick
down
at
wanda
and
del’s.
he
is
simply
confused
of
slick
with
lyman
moore.
and
the
question
is
of
course
then
what
have
we
--
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
no.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
one
person.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
he
says,
a
fellow
he
knew
as
slick
and
he
looks
at
lyman
moore
in
the
court
room
at
the
trial
says
“this
man.”
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
well,
he
reported
to
the
police,
he
reports
that
the
fellow
by
the
name
--
a
man
he
knew
as
slick,
okay.
lyman
moore
of
course
at
that
time
is
not
even
arrested,
it
is
months
later
that
lyman
moore
is
arrested.
alright
now,
i
have
hope
that
i
have
made
clear
to
the
court
what
transpired
in
the
ponderosa
because
that
has
never
ever
been
briefed
by
petitioner
and
certainly
was
not
stated
here
this
morning.
he
knows
two
witnesses
to
that
conversation
have
simply
escaped
the
attention
of
petitioner
and
i
think
that
it
cast
--
an
unfortunate
cast
on
the
entire
case.
now,
in
october
of
1962
some
months
later,
while
this
fruitless
search
for
this
ubiquitous
slick
has
been
going
on
and
he
hasn't
turned
up,
two
chicago
policemen,
another
police
department,
another
jurisdiction
are
on
patrol
and
they
are
fired
upon
or
at
least
shot
a
fire
from
1957
for
an
automobile.
they
approached
the
automobile
and
two
men
plea
from
the
car,
it
staked
out.
the
car
is
search,
a
16-gauge
sort
of
shotgun
is
retrieved
from
the
back
seat
of
the
automobile
and
documents
in
the
car
bearing
the
signature
of
jerry
barbee
are
found.
okay,
the
car
is
staked
out
and
wee
hours
of
the
morning,
two
men
come
back
and
attempt
and
get
to
get
into
the
car
and
at
that
point
they
are
apprehended.
alright,
who
is
apprehended
lyman
moore
and
jerry
barbee.
two
men
referred
to
by
name
in
the
testimony
of
mr.
fair.
jerry
barbee
wears
a
mustache
and
has
dark
hair.
he
has
never
tried
for
the
murder,
bernie
jack
(ph),
he
wasn't
there
when
it
happened.
okay,
interesting
thing
about
this
shotgun,
very
interesting
thing
about
the
shotgun
recovered
from
the
car.
this
arrest
in
october
resulted
in
two
trials
for
two
different
charges.
moore
and
barbee
went
to
trial
together
on
an
armed
robbery
charge
that
took
place
in
july
reported
opinion
in
the
illinois
supreme
court
affirming
the
conviction
35
illinois
second
cited
in
our
brief
this
court
denied
certiori,
subsequent
litigation
of
federal
courts
again
wound
up
in
another
dismissal
or
denial
of
certiori
by
your
honors.
in
that
case
the
previous
relationship
of
lyman
moore
with
his
16-gauge
shotgun
is
rather
clearly
outlined
that
he
and
mr.
barbee
and
the
third
gentleman
staged
a
broad
day
like
hovering
up
over
a
chain
store
supermarket
and
the
same
gun
was
admitted
that
that
trial
would
as
just
said
have
been
a
shotgun
or
not.
in
any
event,
there
had
been
a
previous
tie
up
and
it
had
a
relevance
in
another
context
besides
this
case.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
use
against
mr.
moore
twice.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
two
different
crimes.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
two
were
related
to
the
crimes.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
no,
it
was
used
in
both
cases.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
could
very
well
have
been
used
in
this
crime
and
there
are
ways
i
would
like
to
develop.
i
have
an
answer
to
juries
comment
about
the
a
bill
of
particulars
and
i
want
to
--
in
any
event
we
are
then
try
to
defense
of
this
case
which
has
been
characterized
by
one
dissenting
justice
in
the
illinois
supreme
court
by
the
petitioners
unimpeached
and
that
is
that
an
alibi
provided
by
two
witnesses,
the
first
of
whom
is
a
gentleman
named
alex
cockstel
harvey
or
cockstel
harvey
(ph).
he
is
bartender
at
a
suburban
country
club
and
he
testifies
that
the
pay
records
indicate
the
petitioner
was
paid
for
working
as
a
cocktail
waiter
that
night
and
from
that
he
construes
that
he
must
have
been
there,
although
he
cannot
testify
and
it
is
determined
that
he
cannot,
he
actually
said,
lyman
moore
was
there,
he
did
not
see
him.
at
cross
examination,
he
is
confronted
with
the
fact
that
he
had
previously
made
a
statement
to
the
police
that
he
simply
had
not
seen
lyman
moore
that
night
and
i
think
his
testimony
is
taken
for
what
it
is
worth,
this
is
worth
little
but
in
any
event
herbert
anderson
the
manager
of
the
country
club
is
then
called
to
testify
and
he
tell
us
that
their
pay
records
reflected
lyman
moore,
who
was
paid
for
that
evening
and
that
he
did
not
see
lyman
moore
that
evening
because
but
he
sure
he
must
have
been
there.
so
under
veracity
of
the
bookkeeping
entry
which
was
not
admitted
in
evidence
the
books
and
records
were
not
admitted
that
is
the
alibi.
now,
interesting
thing
about
the
alibi
that
ought
to
be
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court
in
as
much
as
it
is
characterized
by
the
defense
is
unimpeached
and
the
valuable
and
characterizing
in
the
dissenting
opinion
in
the
illinois
supreme
court
which
i
certainly
have
cognizance
of,
as
unimpeached.
the
same
alibi
was
introduced
at
the
armed
robbery
trial
which
i
have
just
referred
to.
three
more
eyewitnesses,
in
other
words
had
misidentified
moore
there
for
a
grand
total
of
five
in
this
case
and
three
in
that.
establishing,
i
suppose
once
and
for
all,
that
lyman
moore
is
unidentifiable
in
the
state
of
illinois
but
in
any
event
the
alibi
is
presented
in
illinois
supreme
court
in
that
case
as
an
answer
to
the
conviction
and
the
illinois
supreme
court
in
that
decision
was
unable
to
reach
the
conclusion
that
the
alibi
was
unimpeachable
and
was
willing
to
leave
it
as
having
been
a
question
for
the
jury
to
decide.
i
simply
point
that
out
because
the
same
justice
that
dissented
in
this
case
and
wrote
the
majority
opinion
in
that
case
is
the
same
judge.
it
is
different
handling
in
the
same
testimony
in
two
different
cases.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
no,
it
was
the
same
--
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
the
same
exact
alibi
testimony
was
offered
that
lyman
moore
had
been
at
work
and
that
the
work
records
which,
i
mean,
i
am
sorry,
it
has
got
different
dates
but
the
same
testimony
that
is
the
work
records
reflected,
he
was
here,
he
was
paid.
therefore
he
must
have
been
here.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
yes,
at
the
westmoreland
country
club
of
wilmette.
i
would
simply
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
very
last
page
of
the
supreme
court
opinion
in
illinois
in
35
second
for
that
because
it
is
interesting
to
compare
the
characterization
of
unimpeached
in
that
case
did
not
work
but
it
is
supposed
to
persuade
here
and
i
do
not
believe
it
does.
now,
what
transpired
at
the
trial
with
reference
to
alleged
suppression
of
evidence
is
i
think
hotly
disputed
in
this
case.
first
of
all
let
me
say
this
in
each
on
every
occasion,
the
state
witness
was
asked
on
cross
examination
by
the
defense,
whether
he
had
made
a
statement
to
the
police,
he
answered
either
affirmatively
or
negatively
and
when
he
answered
in
affirmative,
the
statement
was
tendered
from
the
prosecution's
file.
there
were
three
specific
instances
of
that
witness
hill,
witness
powell
and
witness
fair,
they
were
all
asked
that
they
made
statements
and
they
all
said
yes
and
the
statement
are
all
tendered.
virgle
sanders
was
the
only
one
who
was
not
asked
by
the
defense
counsel
if
he
made
the
prior
statement.
now,
please
picture
in
real
what
is
going
on
the
court
of
illinois
in
1962.
the
prosecutor
does
not
have
the
statement
in
this
file.
testimony
of
virgle
sanders
has
put
on
by
the
prosecutors
developed
in
two
conversations
in
the
library
on
the
second
floor
of
the
criminal
court
(inaudible)
work.
and
on
that
on
the
basis
of
those
interviews
not
any
witness
statements
they
were
in
the
prosecutors
file.
virgle
sanders
went
on
at
the
state
witness
but
in
any
event.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
the
prosecutor's
file
was
tendered
to
the
defense
attorney.
he
never
discovered
it
in
the
file.
the
prosecutor
had
no
recollection
on
being
in
the
file
according
to
his
testimony.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
i
think
the
record
of
his
testimony
for
post
conviction
hearing
must
be
read
to
conclude
that,
he
simply
did
not
know
about
the
statement,
it's
perfectly
clear
from
the
testimony
at
the
trial,
perfectly
clear
i
think
from
mr.
flemming's
testimony
for
post-conviction
hearing
that
he
put
virgle
sanders
on
the
stand
as
a
state
witness
based
on
his
conversations
with
him
down
in
the
library
where
we
conduct
interviews
with
potential
witnesses
in
the
state
in
that
county.
now,
if
the
same
thing
had
happened
with
virgle
sanders,
that
it
happened
with
all
other
witnesses
that
is
at
the
time
of
he
is
cross
examined
by
defense
counsel,
he
would
ask
the
same
question
of
sanders
that
he
had
asked
to
all
other
witnesses.
sanders
would
have
said,
“yes,
i
gave
a
statement
to
the
lansing
police”
but
he
was
never
ask
that
question
at
trial
and
i
want
to
make
that
perfectly
clear.
at
the
very
first
instance
he
was
asked
that
question
at
the
post-conviction
hearing
he
said
“yes”
and
the
statement
was
then
tendered,
of
course
it
didn't
turn
it
up
in
the
mean
time.
my
point
is
simply
this
as
a
prosecutor
in
illinois
and
sitting
there
if
the
defense
counsel
had
asked
virgle
sanders
“did
you
give
the
statement
to
the
police?”
and
he
said
“yes”
one
of
two
things
would
have
happened
in
this
case,
either
the
prosecutor
would
have
pulled
the
statement
out
of
the
file
if
he
had
it
or
he
would
have
turned
with
a
horrible
grimace
on
his
face
that
the
police
man
at
the
table
and
said,
“where
is
the
statement?”
“i
have
no
statement.
”neither
one
of
those
two
things
happen
because
the
question
was
never
asked.
so
no
one
ever
got
put
on
notice
but
all
his
business
about
the
statement
and
the
six
months
all
could
have
been
cleared
up,
if
the
routine
question
always
asked
and
i
would
simply
ask
that
this
did
not
get
asked.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
i
frequently
ask
them
that
and
there
are
others
who
frequently
not
ask
that.
it's
quite
conceivable
that
the
question
did
not
get
asked.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
how
did
he
get
him
as
a
witness?
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
the
brag
that
took
place.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
i
presume
the
lansing
police
found
that
out
somehow,
i
do
not
know,
i
mean
they
are
in
the
same
community
and
it's
a
small
community
and
i
think
something
like
that
would
certainly
have
traveled
to
the
great
find
and
by
the
way
bartender
got
killed
here
and
that
travels
fast
to
that
–
it
was
a
great
line
i
suppose
at
every
level
of
society
and
there
is
one
there
and
i
think
when
a
comment
like
that
would
be
made
in
the
bar
two
days
after
afterwards,
it
found
it's
way
back
to
the
ears
of
some
police
official
and
followed
it
up.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
my
answer
to
your
question
is
that
there
is
no
way
to
tell
from
this
record.
i
cannot
say
no
and
i
cannot
say
yes.
i
do
know
jim
flemming,
if
he
had
a
statement
in
this
file
he
would
have
given
it
to
him.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
if
he
had
known
about
it
he
would
have
gotten
a
copy
of
it.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
well,
it
was
verbal
then
of
course
we
do
not
have
a
problem
because
this
one
was
a
written
statement
than
the
verbal.
we
presume
the
man
had
a
conversation
with
the
police
because
it
was
the
police
that
got
him
to
the
prosecutor.
the
prosecutor
is
always
interviewing
a
man
who
gets
ready
for
trial
he
is
not
at
that
point
interested
in
knowing
about
statement
that
he
has
made
to
the
police,
where
he
is
asking
that
what
happened,
we
are
going
into
the
court
argument.
you
see
i
am
getting
it
your
honor.
it
is
just
not
the
kind
of
the
new
query
which
is
going
to
go
on
at
that
stage
for
preparing
the
man
for
trial.
so
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
any
way
we
can
say
from
this
record
that
the
prosecutor
had
any
kind
of
prior
notice
to
the
statement.
i
wish
he
had,
we
would
not
be
here
today.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
yes
your
honor,
two
cases
wilk
(ph)
and
moses
have
virtually,
incidentally
adopted.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
yes.
well,
i
am
sorry,
moses,
yeah
at
that
time
right,
i
was
just
getting
my
dates.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
yes
but
you
see
the
thing
is
he
might
have
said
that
virgle
sanders
you
talk
to
him,
did
he
made
a
statement
to
talk
to
the
police
and
yes
but
at
the
point
that
this
man
is
the
first
time
we
ever
know
of
virgle
sanders
getting
together
with
the
prosecutors
is
in
the
library
in
the
second
floor,
the
day
before
he
testifies.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
as
frequently
as
breakdowns,
a
communication
can
occur
in
a
larger
of
an
area
it
is
nevertheless
surprising
and
i
have
even
found
myself
in
this
position
many
times,
how
you
will
simply
take
up
with
the
police
give
you.
they
give
you
a
list
the
statement
of
witnesses
and
how
easily
you
slide
in
to
the
presumption
this
is
it.
now,
that
is
a
simply
of
track
of
life
and
when
you
have
a
heavy
trail
load.
in
a
situation
you
try
case
but
to
see
your
fans,
family,
although
that
would
have
been
the
case
and
therefore
you
are
seeking
in
the
near
future.
but
i
am
simply
stating
to
the
court
at
this
time
that
the
prosecutor
had
he
known
about
a
written
statement
certainly
would
have
pursued
the
matter
and
certainly
at
that
time
would
have
been
unnoticed
because
by
that
time
he
has
lyman
moore
grab
sheets
(ph)
from
the
fbi.
he
knows
that
lyman
moore
was
in
the
penitentiary
if
he
has
in
his
hand
a
written
statement
from
lyman
moore
that
says
he
met
the
man
six
months
ago,
isn't
he
certainly
got
to
clear
it
up
before
he
lets
him
go
on
the
stand.
it
is
clear
discrepancy,
of
course
the
simple
answer
to
it
all
is
that
lyman
moore
is
not
slick
and
that
he
is
not
the
man
that
virgle
sanders
met
in
wanda
and
del’s
back
in
november
or
whenever
it
was
in
1961.
it
is
a
simple
mistaken
identity
situation
and
to
that
extent
virgle
sander's
testimony
is
potentially
impeachable
as
to
whether
or
not
he
can
accurately
recall
who
it
was
that
he
talked
to
in
the
ponderosa.
and
it
is
material
only
on
the
aggravation
or
penalty
phase
of
this
case,
if
you
will
because
it
was
a
brag
that's
an
issue
here,
that
the
brag
did
not
take
place.
lyman
moore
cannot
be
nearly
as
bad
a
man
as
you
might
presume.
and
that
is
why
this
would
naturally
be
a
relevant
question
but
two
other
people
that
completely
rehabilitate
in
the
course
of
this
trial,
any
potential
impeachment
of
virgle
sander's
testimony
with
reference
to
who
he
talked
to.
he
might
have
mixed
him
up
with
slick,
he
might
have
thought
he
met
him
before,
and
obviously
as
far
i
am
concerned,
i
am
completely
wrong
about
that.
but
then
he
was
talking
to
lyman
moore
is
established
beyond
any
doubt.
not
a
reasonable
doubt
but
any
doubt.
and
the
testimony
of
the
people
who
identified
him
they
are
fair
and
joyce,
the
people
who
have
spotted
him
in
the
ponderosa,
a
place
in
there
is
not
impeached
in
anyway.
he
was
referred
to
as
i
say
by
name
in
the
testimony
of
mr.
fair.
now,
henley
powell,
i
would
like
touch
on
this.
henley
powell
as
you
recall,
the
gentleman
was
playing
cards
and
he
witnesses
the
shooting.
when
the
police
went
out
there
that
night
and
the
officer
name
koppitz
apparently
drew
a
rough
diagram
of
the
premises,
that
is
in
the
record.
he
drew
a
card
table
and
he
placed
mr.
powell
at
the
seat
and
mr.
powell
said
he
was
identified
and
he
was
sitting
at
the
time
which
would
have
placed
him
roughly
looking
toward
you
mr.
justice
blackmun,
the
door
being
somewhere
over
toward
my
back.
now,
it
is
the
contention
of
the
petitioner
that
this
diagram
which
has
did
not
come
to
light
until
the
post-conviction
was
heard
has
a
devastating
effect
on
the
varsity
of
henley
powell
as
a
witness
and
it
shows
that
he
purged
it
himself
when
he
said,
he
could
see
what
was
going
on
over
by
the
door.
and
this
to
me
is
an
example
of
attempting
to
use
diminimus
to
simply
defeat
due
process.
henley
powell's
testimony
was
that
even
playing
pinochle
sees
in
the
position
like
through
his
handout
because
he
could
not
bid
he
was
looking
towards
the
door
when
he
saw
lyman
moore
come
in,
but
he
supposed
to
purge
it
himself
because
he
was
facing
and
seated
and
facing
at
that
direction.
now,
this
is
the
kind
of
critical
argument
was
presented
to
the
highest
court
in
the
country.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
yes
i
am.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
yes,
i
have
a
comment
or
two
on
it.
as
to
the
weapon,
it
first
of
all
rule
of
law,
i
know
that
most
of
the
jurisdictions
did.
weapons
found
in
the
possession
or
control
of
the
defendant
at
the
time
of
his
arrest
are
admissible
to
the
circumstances
of
the
arrest
for
that
reason
alone
at
that
point.
okay,
these
two
gentlemen
run
this
car,
they
fled
the
car,
they
tried
to
get
back
into
the
car,
at
all
times,
that
they
were
certainly
in
that
car,
they
were
both
in
constructive
possession
of
that
shotgun,
at
the
very
least.
and
if
it
was
jerry
barbee's
car,
if
he
was
driving
and
lyman
moore
even
had
better
access
to
the
shotgun.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
yes,
okay
but
first
of
all
just
the
circumstances
of
the
arrest,
quite
independent
of
the
guns
relevance
to
the
rest
of
the
case.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
the
arrest
was
in
connection
with
what
was
going
on
right
then.
a
shooting
had
taken
of
the
gun
with.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
no,
for
that
matter,
he
was
not
arrested
for
the
other
charge
he
was
tried
on
either
at
that
time
he
was
arrested
based
on
what
had
happened,
the
gun
was
fired
off
in
the
city
limit
and
two
men
led
from
the
car.
but
in
any
event,
as
i
have
described
before,
sort
of
shocking
had
a
relevance
in
another
context
in
another
trial.
the
general
rule
in
illinois
and
most
of
other
jurisdictions
has
always
been,
this
property
would
admit
any
inter-evidence,
any
weapon
which
is
suitable
for
the
commission
of
the
crime
charge,
even
though
it
is
not
the
contention
of
the
prosecution
that
this
is
the
weapon.
now,
there
is
no
question
this
weapon
is
similar
to
the
weapon
that
was
used
as
a
shotgun.
the
prosecute
tendered
a
bill
of
particulars
and
answer
goes
to
bill
of
particulars
on
which
he
said
12-gauge
shotgun
that
is
not
evidence.
an
acute
incident
happened
at
trial,
the
defense
attorney
tried
to
call
the
assistant
state
attorney
to
prove
that
it
was
12-gauge
shotgun.
this
is
a
record
page
763
to
765,
the
defendant
tried
to
call
the
state's
attorney
to
testify
and
it
was
a
12-gauge
shotgun
based
on
the
fact
the
assistant
state's
attorney
had
filed
his
bill
of
particulars.
the
assistance
states
attorney
said
that
if
i
was
called
to
testify,
i
would
testify
on
what
kind
of
gun
was
used.
i
would
get
in
to
that
evidence.
then
a
stipulation
was
entered
into
with
--
toward
the
end
of
the
defense
case
not
the
state
occasion
sheet
that
if
the
certain
crime
like
technician
were
called,
he
would
testify
that
in
his
opinion
it
was
12-gauge
shotgun.
he
was
not
there
and
his
qualification
are
in
the
record
and
it
is
simply
stipulation
in
his
opinion.
so
there
is
no
real
hard
evidence
as
to
what
the
actual
gauge
of
the
shotgun
ever
used.
now,
the
state's
attorney
made
a
gratuitous
remark
in
his
closing
argument
to
the
effect
that
this
probably
was
not
the
gun
and
the
rule
everywhere
in
the
legal.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
it
was
medical
testimony
of
the
shotgun
that
killed
the
man.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
no,
specifically,
herald
wagner's
(ph)
as
pathologist
testified
that
he
did
not
try
to
determine
the
size.
all
he
had
was
the
pellets
spread
throughout
the
body
in
wadding,
and
he
turned
the
wadding
over
to
the
police
department,
that
is
the
last
he
saw
of
it
and
but
then
he
was
made
no
effort.
dr.
wagner's
testimony
if
examined.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
there
is
no
hard
evidence
introduced
by
anybody
as
to
exactly
what
side
the
shotgun
was.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
yes,
a
stipulation
that
in
the
opinion
of
the
technician,
if
called
to
testify
he
would
testify
it
in
his
opinion
that
was
12-gauge
shotgun.
that
is
what
we
have
and
we
have
this
bill
of
particulars
which
is
not
evidence
in
which
the
prosecutor
attempted
to
slop
off
as
not
being
his
work
really.
a
good
remark
that
he
made
in
his
closing
argument
which
i
would
like
on
his
bill
of
particulars,
that
he
is
talking
about
the
gun,
and
of
course
he
is
not
really
as
far
as
i
can
see,
an
unclear
characterization
to
say
that
lyman
moore
is
a
man
who
uses
shotgun.
he
was
arrested
before
and
this
was
the
type
of
the
closing
argument
we
had
and
that
the
shotgun
was
a
particularly
vicious
weapon
to
use
and
after
all
it
was
a
shotgun
that
lyman
moore
killed
the
bartender
with.
i
believe
i
am
not
going
to
have
an
opportunity
to
address
myself
to
witherspoon
point,
i
simply
rested
on
the
--
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
let
me
restrict
that
sense
to
the
question
for
the
use
of
witherspoon
in
the
context
of
peremptory
challenges.
i
am
not
going
to
tell
the
court
about
our
position
that
witherspoon
helps
the
prosecution.
we
do
not
want
to
see
it
go
away
necessarily
because
of
the
fact
that
about
as
many
cases
are
going
to
effect
and
i
think
it
is
a
useful
tool
on
the
prosecutor's
action.
certainly,
he
has
not
done
anything
about
the
rate
of
death
penalty
return.
however,
there
is
nothing
in
the
opinion
with
reference
to
whether
or
not
witherspoon
forbids
the
use
of
prosecution
for
peremptory
challenges
to
remove
people
because
they
could
not
otherwise
has
been
challenged
for
cause.
there
was
an
implication
in
the
anderson
opinion
from
the
california
supreme
court
that
they
like
inference
release
of
decided
that
the
court
by
inference
has
reach
this
conclusion
as
this
is
an
improper
use
of
peremptories,
my
simple
statement
for
the
court
would
be
as
most
unusual
way
of
rosaline
versus
alabama
that
i
could
possibly
imagine,
it
could
not
possible
have
been
in
the
mind
of
the
court.
in
this
case
had
the
eight
jurors,
who
are
arguably
removed
for
cause
and
i
think,
some
of
them
properly
were
but
in
any
event,
my
intention
would
simply
be
that
under
present
standards
and
under
present
techniques
on
witherspoon
questioning,
most
of
those
people
would
have
gone
off
anyway
because
when
asked
the
second
question,
when
you
could
sign
the
verdict,
it
would
say
“yes,
our
experience
teaches
us
that.
from
all
across
the
country
in
our
conversations
with
prosecutor.
therefore
we
still
have
peremptory
challenges
to
eliminate
the
rest
if
that
is
desire
of
the
prosecutor.
i
do
not
think
the
jury
tried
this
man
would
then
compose
with
any
differently
i
think
that
the
opinion
of
the
late
justice
black
and
his
dissenting
opinion
has
proved
to
be
rather
prophetic,
in
a
sense
that
the
conversations
of
the
juries
in
not
going
to
do
any
different.
if
mr.
justice
blackmun
had
any
further
questions
on
witherspoon,
i
think
i
stand
on
the
brief
for
the
rest.
thank
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
mr.
chief
justice,
and
members
of
the
court.
i
would
like
to
say
as
a
prosecutor
from
the
state
of
illinois
that
as
the
evidence
in
this
case
remotely
resembled
the
characterization
which
has
been
described
to,
and
my
colleague
and
friend.
i
would
not
have
the
courage
to
stand
before
this
court
this
morning.
counsel
has
been
involved
in
this
case
for
considerable
length
of
time
and
my
fair
judgment
as
a
attorney
he
is
more
than
a
legend.
and
for
that
reason
i
am
going
to
take
the
liberty
of
restating
the
facts
as
i
truly
think
they
are
reflected
in
the
record.
and
i
only
turn
the
court
to
april
25,
1962
when
a
gentleman
who
i
contend
was
lyman
moore
and
a
companion
who
was
a
dark
haired
man
wearing
a
mustache
went
into
a
tavern
in
lansing
and
where
the
petitioner
lyman
moore
was
subsequently
objected
for
profane
language
who
returned
approximately
one
hour
later
and
at
time
later
shot
gun
across
the
bar
and
terminated
mr.
bernard
zitek.
now,
not
mentioned
this
morning
at
all
is
the
fact
that
two
people,
one
the
cocktail
waitress
patricia
hill
from
a
distance
of
six
feet
observed
this
whole
incident
twice.
she
observed
the
ejection,
she
observed
the
subsequent
shooting
an
hour
later
and
she
said
at
trial
the
lyman
moore
was
the
gun
man.
lyman
moore
was
the
man
who
ejected
an
hour
earlier.
another
patron
of
the
tavern,
a
man
by
the
name
of
henley
powell
was
present
in
the
tavern
at
the
time
that
the
shooting
took
place.
he
is
not
able
to
tell
us
whether
moore
was
the
man
ejected
from
the
tavern,
he
may
not
even
have
been
there
at
that
time
but
henley
powell
was
playing
pinochle
with
a
few
other
gentlemen
around
the
table
and
his
testimony
is
pertinent
in
another
point
here.
playing
pinochle,
severed
the
fate
of
many
pinochle
players
he
cannot
beat,
so
he
lays
his
hand
down.
he
is
sitting
out
of
the
the
hand
and
he
looks
toward
the
door
and
what
does
he
observe
that
lyman
moore,
who
he
identifies
at
the
trial,
come
through
the
door
carrying
a
shotgun,
walk
up
to
the
bar
and
killed
the
bartender
mr.
zitek.
henley
powell
pursued
lyman
moore
out
of
the
tavern
and
was
confronted
with
him
in
a
well
lighted
street
where
upon
lyman
moore
told
henley
powell
according
to
mr.
henley
powell
“get
back
or
i
kill
you
too.”
now,
these
two
people
were
not
discussed
this
morning
but
this
was
the
state's
case
and
chief,
this
was
the
eyewitness
to
the
killing.
now,
two
days
later
in
another
tavern
call
the
ponderosa
tavern
no
way
related
to
the
tavern
where
the
killing
takes
place,
vigle
sanders
is
having
a
beer
with
the
gentlemen
who
he
at
the
time
is
identifying
as
slick
and
at
trial
says
he
knew
as
slick
and
this
gentleman
says
to
him,
“it
is
open
season
on
bartenders,
i
shot
one
over
in
lansing.”
now,
totally
unmentioned
in
any
the
petitioner's
brief
and
not
mentioned
here
this
morning
is,
there
were
a
couple
of
other
people
there
when
that
conversation
took
place.
one
of
whom
was
the
bartender,
skinhead
joyce.
now,
skinhead
is
standing
behind
the
bar
and
vigle
sanders
approaches
him
and
said,
“this
gentleman
would
like
to
have
a
ride
over
to
harvey,
can
we
arrange
that?”
and
mr.
skinhead
moore,
joyce
rather
testifies
at
trial
that,
“yes,
he
arranged
for
the
ride
that
lyman
moore
was
the
man
in
the
bar
conversing
with
virgle
sanders.
now,
they
need
to
get
a
ride
from
mr.
moore
who
they
contacted,
they
contacted
the
owner
of
ponderosa
who
is
also
in
the
tavern
at
the
time
and
he
says,
“can
you
arrange
for
a
lift
for
this
fellow
here?”
and
his
companion
who
again
by
the
way
is
the
dark
haired
man
wearing
a
mustache,
same
description
we
have
of
the
companion
of
moore
at
the
time
he
is
ejected
from
the
tavern,
okay.
what
happens
then?
mr.
fair
accommodates
these
two
gentlemen
and
drives
them
all
the
way
to
harvey,
in
the
course
of
which
they
stopped
twice
in
two
different
tavern
and
enjoyed
themselves
as
companions.
now,
mr.
fair
testifies
at
trial
that
lyman
moore
is
the
man
that
he
accommodated
and
he
is
the
man
who
is
the
ponderosa
and
he
is
the
man
he
drove
to
harvey.
and
that
furthermore
in
the
course
of
their
automobile
ride
and
this
time
his
testimony
he
is
referring
to
them
as
moore
and
barbee,
because
they
are
on
the
first
name
basis
at
this
point
or
second
name
basis
and
i
knew
that.
at
this
point
he
says
during
the
course
of
the
automobile
ride
one
of
them
and
it
is
not
clear
from
the
record
which
said,
“if
we
have
to
have
that
trouble
with
that
bartender
in
lansing
we
would
be
in
this
spot,”
testimony
that
of
fair,
“well,
if
we
had
to
have
a
trouble
with
the
bartender
in
lansing
we
had
been
alright,”
that
is
what
he
said.
now,
mr.
fair
was
called
to
testify
at
trial
and
he
testified
that
lyman
moore
was
the
man
that
went
from
him
from
the
ponderosa,
after
he
request
of
joyce,
the
bartender
and
he
is
the
man
that
he
drove
to
harvey.
now,
that
tells
me
that
virgle
sanders
statement
that
lyman
moore
was
in
ponderosa
with
him
has
been
corroborated
and
that
any
misidentification
or
confusion
of
identities
that
virgle
sanders
is
subsequently
trapped
with
because
of
his
murky
recollections
of
phantom
named
slick
was
yet
to
be
underground
by
anybody
and
the
police
obviously
abandoned
once
they
had
three,
two
eyewitnesses
to
the
killing
and
three
witnesses
to
the
brag.
it
tells
me
that
vigle
sanders
testimony
is
accurate,
insofar
as
it
purports
to
reflect
the
conversation
that
he
had
with
lyman
moore
and
that
it
is
inaccurate
insofar
as
he
purports
to
tell
us
that
lyman
moore
and
a
fellow
by
name
is
slick
are
same
people,
they
are
not,
slick
was
a
--
if
lyman
moore
is
slick
it
is
impossible.
slick
is
a
fellow
that
this
gentleman
sanders
met
in
wanda
and
del’s
back
in
november
sometime
i
suppose
in
1961.
lyman
moore
is
in
the
federal
penitentiary
that
time,
a
bank
robbery
charge.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
no,
he
did
not
know.
neither
one
of
them
testified
to
the
contents
of
the
conversation.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
neither
joyce
or
mr.
fair
who
corroborate
--
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
only
sanders
testifies
as
to
what
was
said
and
that
has
never
been
questioned.
mr.
doherty
today
is
asserting
that
that
statement
was
simply
made
by
another
man
not
that
the
statement
was
not
made.
the
verbiage
of
the
conversation
is
beyond
dispute.
what
is
undisputed
is
that
who
said
it,
i
do
not
think
it
is
undisputed,
i
think
it
is
perfectly
clear
from
the
records
themselves.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
no,
it
was
said
in
the
ponderosa
tap
and
there
is
no
dispute
up
to
that,
it
was
said,
two
day
later
on
april
27,
1962
no
dispute.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
he
said
that
the
man
he
was
in
the
ponderosa
with
who
he
knew
as
slick
made
it.
now,
the
man
he
was
in
ponderosa
with
was
lyman
moore
and
slick
was
ever
there.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
a
man
he
knew
as
slick.
he
mixed
up
lyman.
he
evidently
met
slick
in
wanda
and
del’s
and
everybody
down
at
wanda
and
del’s
seems
to
know
slick
and
so
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
this
gentleman
would
have
not
met
slick
down
at
wanda
and
del’s.
he
is
simply
confused
of
slick
with
lyman
moore.
and
the
question
is
of
course
then
what
have
we
--
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
no.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
one
person.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
he
says,
a
fellow
he
knew
as
slick
and
he
looks
at
lyman
moore
in
the
court
room
at
the
trial
says
“this
man.”
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
well,
he
reported
to
the
police,
he
reports
that
the
fellow
by
the
name
--
a
man
he
knew
as
slick,
okay.
lyman
moore
of
course
at
that
time
is
not
even
arrested,
it
is
months
later
that
lyman
moore
is
arrested.
alright
now,
i
have
hope
that
i
have
made
clear
to
the
court
what
transpired
in
the
ponderosa
because
that
has
never
ever
been
briefed
by
petitioner
and
certainly
was
not
stated
here
this
morning.
he
knows
two
witnesses
to
that
conversation
have
simply
escaped
the
attention
of
petitioner
and
i
think
that
it
cast
--
an
unfortunate
cast
on
the
entire
case.
now,
in
october
of
1962
some
months
later,
while
this
fruitless
search
for
this
ubiquitous
slick
has
been
going
on
and
he
hasn't
turned
up,
two
chicago
policemen,
another
police
department,
another
jurisdiction
are
on
patrol
and
they
are
fired
upon
or
at
least
shot
a
fire
from
1957
for
an
automobile.
they
approached
the
automobile
and
two
men
plea
from
the
car,
it
staked
out.
the
car
is
search,
a
16-gauge
sort
of
shotgun
is
retrieved
from
the
back
seat
of
the
automobile
and
documents
in
the
car
bearing
the
signature
of
jerry
barbee
are
found.
okay,
the
car
is
staked
out
and
wee
hours
of
the
morning,
two
men
come
back
and
attempt
and
get
to
get
into
the
car
and
at
that
point
they
are
apprehended.
alright,
who
is
apprehended
lyman
moore
and
jerry
barbee.
two
men
referred
to
by
name
in
the
testimony
of
mr.
fair.
jerry
barbee
wears
a
mustache
and
has
dark
hair.
he
has
never
tried
for
the
murder,
bernie
jack
(ph),
he
wasn't
there
when
it
happened.
okay,
interesting
thing
about
this
shotgun,
very
interesting
thing
about
the
shotgun
recovered
from
the
car.
this
arrest
in
october
resulted
in
two
trials
for
two
different
charges.
moore
and
barbee
went
to
trial
together
on
an
armed
robbery
charge
that
took
place
in
july
reported
opinion
in
the
illinois
supreme
court
affirming
the
conviction
35
illinois
second
cited
in
our
brief
this
court
denied
certiori,
subsequent
litigation
of
federal
courts
again
wound
up
in
another
dismissal
or
denial
of
certiori
by
your
honors.
in
that
case
the
previous
relationship
of
lyman
moore
with
his
16-gauge
shotgun
is
rather
clearly
outlined
that
he
and
mr.
barbee
and
the
third
gentleman
staged
a
broad
day
like
hovering
up
over
a
chain
store
supermarket
and
the
same
gun
was
admitted
that
that
trial
would
as
just
said
have
been
a
shotgun
or
not.
in
any
event,
there
had
been
a
previous
tie
up
and
it
had
a
relevance
in
another
context
besides
this
case.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
use
against
mr.
moore
twice.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
two
different
crimes.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
two
were
related
to
the
crimes.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
no,
it
was
used
in
both
cases.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
could
very
well
have
been
used
in
this
crime
and
there
are
ways
i
would
like
to
develop.
i
have
an
answer
to
juries
comment
about
the
a
bill
of
particulars
and
i
want
to
--
in
any
event
we
are
then
try
to
defense
of
this
case
which
has
been
characterized
by
one
dissenting
justice
in
the
illinois
supreme
court
by
the
petitioners
unimpeached
and
that
is
that
an
alibi
provided
by
two
witnesses,
the
first
of
whom
is
a
gentleman
named
alex
cockstel
harvey
or
cockstel
harvey
(ph).
he
is
bartender
at
a
suburban
country
club
and
he
testifies
that
the
pay
records
indicate
the
petitioner
was
paid
for
working
as
a
cocktail
waiter
that
night
and
from
that
he
construes
that
he
must
have
been
there,
although
he
cannot
testify
and
it
is
determined
that
he
cannot,
he
actually
said,
lyman
moore
was
there,
he
did
not
see
him.
at
cross
examination,
he
is
confronted
with
the
fact
that
he
had
previously
made
a
statement
to
the
police
that
he
simply
had
not
seen
lyman
moore
that
night
and
i
think
his
testimony
is
taken
for
what
it
is
worth,
this
is
worth
little
but
in
any
event
herbert
anderson
the
manager
of
the
country
club
is
then
called
to
testify
and
he
tell
us
that
their
pay
records
reflected
lyman
moore,
who
was
paid
for
that
evening
and
that
he
did
not
see
lyman
moore
that
evening
because
but
he
sure
he
must
have
been
there.
so
under
veracity
of
the
bookkeeping
entry
which
was
not
admitted
in
evidence
the
books
and
records
were
not
admitted
that
is
the
alibi.
now,
interesting
thing
about
the
alibi
that
ought
to
be
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court
in
as
much
as
it
is
characterized
by
the
defense
is
unimpeached
and
the
valuable
and
characterizing
in
the
dissenting
opinion
in
the
illinois
supreme
court
which
i
certainly
have
cognizance
of,
as
unimpeached.
the
same
alibi
was
introduced
at
the
armed
robbery
trial
which
i
have
just
referred
to.
three
more
eyewitnesses,
in
other
words
had
misidentified
moore
there
for
a
grand
total
of
five
in
this
case
and
three
in
that.
establishing,
i
suppose
once
and
for
all,
that
lyman
moore
is
unidentifiable
in
the
state
of
illinois
but
in
any
event
the
alibi
is
presented
in
illinois
supreme
court
in
that
case
as
an
answer
to
the
conviction
and
the
illinois
supreme
court
in
that
decision
was
unable
to
reach
the
conclusion
that
the
alibi
was
unimpeachable
and
was
willing
to
leave
it
as
having
been
a
question
for
the
jury
to
decide.
i
simply
point
that
out
because
the
same
justice
that
dissented
in
this
case
and
wrote
the
majority
opinion
in
that
case
is
the
same
judge.
it
is
different
handling
in
the
same
testimony
in
two
different
cases.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
no,
it
was
the
same
--
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
the
same
exact
alibi
testimony
was
offered
that
lyman
moore
had
been
at
work
and
that
the
work
records
which,
i
mean,
i
am
sorry,
it
has
got
different
dates
but
the
same
testimony
that
is
the
work
records
reflected,
he
was
here,
he
was
paid.
therefore
he
must
have
been
here.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
yes,
at
the
westmoreland
country
club
of
wilmette.
i
would
simply
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
very
last
page
of
the
supreme
court
opinion
in
illinois
in
35
second
for
that
because
it
is
interesting
to
compare
the
characterization
of
unimpeached
in
that
case
did
not
work
but
it
is
supposed
to
persuade
here
and
i
do
not
believe
it
does.
now,
what
transpired
at
the
trial
with
reference
to
alleged
suppression
of
evidence
is
i
think
hotly
disputed
in
this
case.
first
of
all
let
me
say
this
in
each
on
every
occasion,
the
state
witness
was
asked
on
cross
examination
by
the
defense,
whether
he
had
made
a
statement
to
the
police,
he
answered
either
affirmatively
or
negatively
and
when
he
answered
in
affirmative,
the
statement
was
tendered
from
the
prosecution's
file.
there
were
three
specific
instances
of
that
witness
hill,
witness
powell
and
witness
fair,
they
were
all
asked
that
they
made
statements
and
they
all
said
yes
and
the
statement
are
all
tendered.
virgle
sanders
was
the
only
one
who
was
not
asked
by
the
defense
counsel
if
he
made
the
prior
statement.
now,
please
picture
in
real
what
is
going
on
the
court
of
illinois
in
1962.
the
prosecutor
does
not
have
the
statement
in
this
file.
testimony
of
virgle
sanders
has
put
on
by
the
prosecutors
developed
in
two
conversations
in
the
library
on
the
second
floor
of
the
criminal
court
(inaudible)
work.
and
on
that
on
the
basis
of
those
interviews
not
any
witness
statements
they
were
in
the
prosecutors
file.
virgle
sanders
went
on
at
the
state
witness
but
in
any
event.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
the
prosecutor's
file
was
tendered
to
the
defense
attorney.
he
never
discovered
it
in
the
file.
the
prosecutor
had
no
recollection
on
being
in
the
file
according
to
his
testimony.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
i
think
the
record
of
his
testimony
for
post
conviction
hearing
must
be
read
to
conclude
that,
he
simply
did
not
know
about
the
statement,
it's
perfectly
clear
from
the
testimony
at
the
trial,
perfectly
clear
i
think
from
mr.
flemming's
testimony
for
post-conviction
hearing
that
he
put
virgle
sanders
on
the
stand
as
a
state
witness
based
on
his
conversations
with
him
down
in
the
library
where
we
conduct
interviews
with
potential
witnesses
in
the
state
in
that
county.
now,
if
the
same
thing
had
happened
with
virgle
sanders,
that
it
happened
with
all
other
witnesses
that
is
at
the
time
of
he
is
cross
examined
by
defense
counsel,
he
would
ask
the
same
question
of
sanders
that
he
had
asked
to
all
other
witnesses.
sanders
would
have
said,
“yes,
i
gave
a
statement
to
the
lansing
police”
but
he
was
never
ask
that
question
at
trial
and
i
want
to
make
that
perfectly
clear.
at
the
very
first
instance
he
was
asked
that
question
at
the
post-conviction
hearing
he
said
“yes”
and
the
statement
was
then
tendered,
of
course
it
didn't
turn
it
up
in
the
mean
time.
my
point
is
simply
this
as
a
prosecutor
in
illinois
and
sitting
there
if
the
defense
counsel
had
asked
virgle
sanders
“did
you
give
the
statement
to
the
police?”
and
he
said
“yes”
one
of
two
things
would
have
happened
in
this
case,
either
the
prosecutor
would
have
pulled
the
statement
out
of
the
file
if
he
had
it
or
he
would
have
turned
with
a
horrible
grimace
on
his
face
that
the
police
man
at
the
table
and
said,
“where
is
the
statement?”
“i
have
no
statement.
”neither
one
of
those
two
things
happen
because
the
question
was
never
asked.
so
no
one
ever
got
put
on
notice
but
all
his
business
about
the
statement
and
the
six
months
all
could
have
been
cleared
up,
if
the
routine
question
always
asked
and
i
would
simply
ask
that
this
did
not
get
asked.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
i
frequently
ask
them
that
and
there
are
others
who
frequently
not
ask
that.
it's
quite
conceivable
that
the
question
did
not
get
asked.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
how
did
he
get
him
as
a
witness?
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
the
brag
that
took
place.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
i
presume
the
lansing
police
found
that
out
somehow,
i
do
not
know,
i
mean
they
are
in
the
same
community
and
it's
a
small
community
and
i
think
something
like
that
would
certainly
have
traveled
to
the
great
find
and
by
the
way
bartender
got
killed
here
and
that
travels
fast
to
that
–
it
was
a
great
line
i
suppose
at
every
level
of
society
and
there
is
one
there
and
i
think
when
a
comment
like
that
would
be
made
in
the
bar
two
days
after
afterwards,
it
found
it's
way
back
to
the
ears
of
some
police
official
and
followed
it
up.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
my
answer
to
your
question
is
that
there
is
no
way
to
tell
from
this
record.
i
cannot
say
no
and
i
cannot
say
yes.
i
do
know
jim
flemming,
if
he
had
a
statement
in
this
file
he
would
have
given
it
to
him.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
if
he
had
known
about
it
he
would
have
gotten
a
copy
of
it.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
well,
it
was
verbal
then
of
course
we
do
not
have
a
problem
because
this
one
was
a
written
statement
than
the
verbal.
we
presume
the
man
had
a
conversation
with
the
police
because
it
was
the
police
that
got
him
to
the
prosecutor.
the
prosecutor
is
always
interviewing
a
man
who
gets
ready
for
trial
he
is
not
at
that
point
interested
in
knowing
about
statement
that
he
has
made
to
the
police,
where
he
is
asking
that
what
happened,
we
are
going
into
the
court
argument.
you
see
i
am
getting
it
your
honor.
it
is
just
not
the
kind
of
the
new
query
which
is
going
to
go
on
at
that
stage
for
preparing
the
man
for
trial.
so
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
any
way
we
can
say
from
this
record
that
the
prosecutor
had
any
kind
of
prior
notice
to
the
statement.
i
wish
he
had,
we
would
not
be
here
today.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
yes
your
honor,
two
cases
wilk
(ph)
and
moses
have
virtually,
incidentally
adopted.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
yes.
well,
i
am
sorry,
moses,
yeah
at
that
time
right,
i
was
just
getting
my
dates.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
yes
but
you
see
the
thing
is
he
might
have
said
that
virgle
sanders
you
talk
to
him,
did
he
made
a
statement
to
talk
to
the
police
and
yes
but
at
the
point
that
this
man
is
the
first
time
we
ever
know
of
virgle
sanders
getting
together
with
the
prosecutors
is
in
the
library
in
the
second
floor,
the
day
before
he
testifies.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
as
frequently
as
breakdowns,
a
communication
can
occur
in
a
larger
of
an
area
it
is
nevertheless
surprising
and
i
have
even
found
myself
in
this
position
many
times,
how
you
will
simply
take
up
with
the
police
give
you.
they
give
you
a
list
the
statement
of
witnesses
and
how
easily
you
slide
in
to
the
presumption
this
is
it.
now,
that
is
a
simply
of
track
of
life
and
when
you
have
a
heavy
trail
load.
in
a
situation
you
try
case
but
to
see
your
fans,
family,
although
that
would
have
been
the
case
and
therefore
you
are
seeking
in
the
near
future.
but
i
am
simply
stating
to
the
court
at
this
time
that
the
prosecutor
had
he
known
about
a
written
statement
certainly
would
have
pursued
the
matter
and
certainly
at
that
time
would
have
been
unnoticed
because
by
that
time
he
has
lyman
moore
grab
sheets
(ph)
from
the
fbi.
he
knows
that
lyman
moore
was
in
the
penitentiary
if
he
has
in
his
hand
a
written
statement
from
lyman
moore
that
says
he
met
the
man
six
months
ago,
isn't
he
certainly
got
to
clear
it
up
before
he
lets
him
go
on
the
stand.
it
is
clear
discrepancy,
of
course
the
simple
answer
to
it
all
is
that
lyman
moore
is
not
slick
and
that
he
is
not
the
man
that
virgle
sanders
met
in
wanda
and
del’s
back
in
november
or
whenever
it
was
in
1961.
it
is
a
simple
mistaken
identity
situation
and
to
that
extent
virgle
sander's
testimony
is
potentially
impeachable
as
to
whether
or
not
he
can
accurately
recall
who
it
was
that
he
talked
to
in
the
ponderosa.
and
it
is
material
only
on
the
aggravation
or
penalty
phase
of
this
case,
if
you
will
because
it
was
a
brag
that's
an
issue
here,
that
the
brag
did
not
take
place.
lyman
moore
cannot
be
nearly
as
bad
a
man
as
you
might
presume.
and
that
is
why
this
would
naturally
be
a
relevant
question
but
two
other
people
that
completely
rehabilitate
in
the
course
of
this
trial,
any
potential
impeachment
of
virgle
sander's
testimony
with
reference
to
who
he
talked
to.
he
might
have
mixed
him
up
with
slick,
he
might
have
thought
he
met
him
before,
and
obviously
as
far
i
am
concerned,
i
am
completely
wrong
about
that.
but
then
he
was
talking
to
lyman
moore
is
established
beyond
any
doubt.
not
a
reasonable
doubt
but
any
doubt.
and
the
testimony
of
the
people
who
identified
him
they
are
fair
and
joyce,
the
people
who
have
spotted
him
in
the
ponderosa,
a
place
in
there
is
not
impeached
in
anyway.
he
was
referred
to
as
i
say
by
name
in
the
testimony
of
mr.
fair.
now,
henley
powell,
i
would
like
touch
on
this.
henley
powell
as
you
recall,
the
gentleman
was
playing
cards
and
he
witnesses
the
shooting.
when
the
police
went
out
there
that
night
and
the
officer
name
koppitz
apparently
drew
a
rough
diagram
of
the
premises,
that
is
in
the
record.
he
drew
a
card
table
and
he
placed
mr.
powell
at
the
seat
and
mr.
powell
said
he
was
identified
and
he
was
sitting
at
the
time
which
would
have
placed
him
roughly
looking
toward
you
mr.
justice
blackmun,
the
door
being
somewhere
over
toward
my
back.
now,
it
is
the
contention
of
the
petitioner
that
this
diagram
which
has
did
not
come
to
light
until
the
post-conviction
was
heard
has
a
devastating
effect
on
the
varsity
of
henley
powell
as
a
witness
and
it
shows
that
he
purged
it
himself
when
he
said,
he
could
see
what
was
going
on
over
by
the
door.
and
this
to
me
is
an
example
of
attempting
to
use
diminimus
to
simply
defeat
due
process.
henley
powell's
testimony
was
that
even
playing
pinochle
sees
in
the
position
like
through
his
handout
because
he
could
not
bid
he
was
looking
towards
the
door
when
he
saw
lyman
moore
come
in,
but
he
supposed
to
purge
it
himself
because
he
was
facing
and
seated
and
facing
at
that
direction.
now,
this
is
the
kind
of
critical
argument
was
presented
to
the
highest
court
in
the
country.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
yes
i
am.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
yes,
i
have
a
comment
or
two
on
it.
as
to
the
weapon,
it
first
of
all
rule
of
law,
i
know
that
most
of
the
jurisdictions
did.
weapons
found
in
the
possession
or
control
of
the
defendant
at
the
time
of
his
arrest
are
admissible
to
the
circumstances
of
the
arrest
for
that
reason
alone
at
that
point.
okay,
these
two
gentlemen
run
this
car,
they
fled
the
car,
they
tried
to
get
back
into
the
car,
at
all
times,
that
they
were
certainly
in
that
car,
they
were
both
in
constructive
possession
of
that
shotgun,
at
the
very
least.
and
if
it
was
jerry
barbee's
car,
if
he
was
driving
and
lyman
moore
even
had
better
access
to
the
shotgun.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
yes,
okay
but
first
of
all
just
the
circumstances
of
the
arrest,
quite
independent
of
the
guns
relevance
to
the
rest
of
the
case.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
the
arrest
was
in
connection
with
what
was
going
on
right
then.
a
shooting
had
taken
of
the
gun
with.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
no,
for
that
matter,
he
was
not
arrested
for
the
other
charge
he
was
tried
on
either
at
that
time
he
was
arrested
based
on
what
had
happened,
the
gun
was
fired
off
in
the
city
limit
and
two
men
led
from
the
car.
but
in
any
event,
as
i
have
described
before,
sort
of
shocking
had
a
relevance
in
another
context
in
another
trial.
the
general
rule
in
illinois
and
most
of
other
jurisdictions
has
always
been,
this
property
would
admit
any
inter-evidence,
any
weapon
which
is
suitable
for
the
commission
of
the
crime
charge,
even
though
it
is
not
the
contention
of
the
prosecution
that
this
is
the
weapon.
now,
there
is
no
question
this
weapon
is
similar
to
the
weapon
that
was
used
as
a
shotgun.
the
prosecute
tendered
a
bill
of
particulars
and
answer
goes
to
bill
of
particulars
on
which
he
said
12-gauge
shotgun
that
is
not
evidence.
an
acute
incident
happened
at
trial,
the
defense
attorney
tried
to
call
the
assistant
state
attorney
to
prove
that
it
was
12-gauge
shotgun.
this
is
a
record
page
763
to
765,
the
defendant
tried
to
call
the
state's
attorney
to
testify
and
it
was
a
12-gauge
shotgun
based
on
the
fact
the
assistant
state's
attorney
had
filed
his
bill
of
particulars.
the
assistance
states
attorney
said
that
if
i
was
called
to
testify,
i
would
testify
on
what
kind
of
gun
was
used.
i
would
get
in
to
that
evidence.
then
a
stipulation
was
entered
into
with
--
toward
the
end
of
the
defense
case
not
the
state
occasion
sheet
that
if
the
certain
crime
like
technician
were
called,
he
would
testify
that
in
his
opinion
it
was
12-gauge
shotgun.
he
was
not
there
and
his
qualification
are
in
the
record
and
it
is
simply
stipulation
in
his
opinion.
so
there
is
no
real
hard
evidence
as
to
what
the
actual
gauge
of
the
shotgun
ever
used.
now,
the
state's
attorney
made
a
gratuitous
remark
in
his
closing
argument
to
the
effect
that
this
probably
was
not
the
gun
and
the
rule
everywhere
in
the
legal.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
it
was
medical
testimony
of
the
shotgun
that
killed
the
man.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
no,
specifically,
herald
wagner's
(ph)
as
pathologist
testified
that
he
did
not
try
to
determine
the
size.
all
he
had
was
the
pellets
spread
throughout
the
body
in
wadding,
and
he
turned
the
wadding
over
to
the
police
department,
that
is
the
last
he
saw
of
it
and
but
then
he
was
made
no
effort.
dr.
wagner's
testimony
if
examined.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
there
is
no
hard
evidence
introduced
by
anybody
as
to
exactly
what
side
the
shotgun
was.
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
yes,
a
stipulation
that
in
the
opinion
of
the
technician,
if
called
to
testify
he
would
testify
it
in
his
opinion
that
was
12-gauge
shotgun.
that
is
what
we
have
and
we
have
this
bill
of
particulars
which
is
not
evidence
in
which
the
prosecutor
attempted
to
slop
off
as
not
being
his
work
really.
a
good
remark
that
he
made
in
his
closing
argument
which
i
would
like
on
his
bill
of
particulars,
that
he
is
talking
about
the
gun,
and
of
course
he
is
not
really
as
far
as
i
can
see,
an
unclear
characterization
to
say
that
lyman
moore
is
a
man
who
uses
shotgun.
he
was
arrested
before
and
this
was
the
type
of
the
closing
argument
we
had
and
that
the
shotgun
was
a
particularly
vicious
weapon
to
use
and
after
all
it
was
a
shotgun
that
lyman
moore
killed
the
bartender
with.
i
believe
i
am
not
going
to
have
an
opportunity
to
address
myself
to
witherspoon
point,
i
simply
rested
on
the
--
mr.
thomas
j.
immel
let
me
restrict
that
sense
to
the
question
for
the
use
of
witherspoon
in
the
context
of
peremptory
challenges.
i
am
not
going
to
tell
the
court
about
our
position
that
witherspoon
helps
the
prosecution.
we
do
not
want
to
see
it
go
away
necessarily
because
of
the
fact
that
about
as
many
cases
are
going
to
effect
and
i
think
it
is
a
useful
tool
on
the
prosecutor's
action.
certainly,
he
has
not
done
anything
about
the
rate
of
death
penalty
return.
however,
there
is
nothing
in
the
opinion
with
reference
to
whether
or
not
witherspoon
forbids
the
use
of
prosecution
for
peremptory
challenges
to
remove
people
because
they
could
not
otherwise
has
been
challenged
for
cause.
there
was
an
implication
in
the
anderson
opinion
from
the
california
supreme
court
that
they
like
inference
release
of
decided
that
the
court
by
inference
has
reach
this
conclusion
as
this
is
an
improper
use
of
peremptories,
my
simple
statement
for
the
court
would
be
as
most
unusual
way
of
rosaline
versus
alabama
that
i
could
possibly
imagine,
it
could
not
possible
have
been
in
the
mind
of
the
court.
in
this
case
had
the
eight
jurors,
who
are
arguably
removed
for
cause
and
i
think,
some
of
them
properly
were
but
in
any
event,
my
intention
would
simply
be
that
under
present
standards
and
under
present
techniques
on
witherspoon
questioning,
most
of
those
people
would
have
gone
off
anyway
because
when
asked
the
second
question,
when
you
could
sign
the
verdict,
it
would
say
“yes,
our
experience
teaches
us
that.
from
all
across
the
country
in
our
conversations
with
prosecutor.
therefore
we
still
have
peremptory
challenges
to
eliminate
the
rest
if
that
is
desire
of
the
prosecutor.
i
do
not
think
the
jury
tried
this
man
would
then
compose
with
any
differently
i
think
that
the
opinion
of
the
late
justice
black
and
his
dissenting
opinion
has
proved
to
be
rather
prophetic,
in
a
sense
that
the
conversations
of
the
juries
in
not
going
to
do
any
different.
if
mr.
justice
blackmun
had
any
further
questions
on
witherspoon,
i
think
i
stand
on
the
brief
for
the
rest.
thank
your
honor.
