mr.
james
j.
doherty
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
prosecution
for
murder,
the
state
concealed
six
items
of
exonerating
evidence
and
used
a
weapon
that
was
not
connected
with
the
petitioner
moore
or
the
offense,
that
announced
him
as
a
bad
man
generally
and
the
jury
that
had
been
selected
in
violation
of
witherspoon
standards
found
petitioner
guilty
and
fixed
his
punishment
of
death.
this
case
begins
at
10
pm
on
wednesday,
april
25,
1962.
a
bartender
in
lansing,
illinois
ejected
a
profane
customer
on
this
tavern.
at
10:55
pm
that
customer
rushed
back
in
with
a
twelve
gauge
shot
gun
and
shot
him
in
the
heart
and
killed
him.
two
days
later
in
the
nearby
tavern
a
man
known
only
by
the
nickname
slick
bragged
that
he
had
shot
the
bartender
in
lansing.
trial
was
held
25
months
later.
two
state
witnesses
identified
petitioner
moore
as
the
assailant.
two
of
his
employers
testified
that
he
was
at
work
50
miles
north
of
lansing,
illinois
in
wilmette
country
club
until
after
midnight.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
lansing
is
south
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
chicago,
riverdale,
dolton,
south
holland,
lansing.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
well,
i
do
not
know
your
honor.
i
would
say
it
about
the
27
to
30
miles
and
a
little
bit
east.
this
is
far
southeast
you
should
not
get
to
(inaudible)
and
wilmette
is
way
north
and
this
was
before
we
had
that
dan
ryan
expressway
opened
up.
you
could
not
have
got
there
50
miles
except
by
going
through
small
side
streets
of
that,
but
nothing
open,
of
course
the
auto
drive
is
open.
now,
opposing
those
two
people
that
said
that
he
was
the
assailant,
that
these
employers
and
verified
by
the
work
records,
he
was
paid
overtime,
worked
till
after
midnight
that
night.
the
most
damaging
evidence
against
this
man
moore
on
the
testimony
of
state
witness
virgle
sanders.
virgle
sanders
identified
the
petitioner
moore
as
a
man
that
he
knew,
a
man
that
he
had
seen
several
times
before,
but
knew
only
by
the
nickname
slick.
he
testified
that
on
friday
afternoon,
1:30
pm,
that
is
less
than
40
hours
after
this
killing,
this
man
slick
was
in
the
tavern,
ponderosa
tavern
and
said
to
him
“hey,
virgle,
it's
open
season
on
bartenders.
i
shot
one
in
the
lansing
on
last
wednesday
night.”
now
five
of
the
concealed
items
of
exonerating
evidence
involved
virgle
sanders.
they
were
uncovered
in
the
post
conviction
hearing
that
took
place
on
january
1967.
friday
night,
i
mean
friday
afternoon,
april
27th
at
1:30
pm
that
is
the
bragging
incident.
really
the
voluntary
confession
of
this
man
slick
that
he
killed
the
bartender.
next
day,
saturday,
a
lansing
police
are
in
that
ponderosa
tap
in
their
clock
in
to
a
man
named
william,
leon
thomson.
“did
you
hear
about
it?”
“oh,
yes
he
heard
about
it.”
“can
you
identify
slick?”
“yes,
i
can.”
monday,
april
30,
1962
8:50
pm,
sanders
is
in
the
police
station
of
lansing
and
he
is
giving
the
statement
and
tells
the
police
that
he
first
met
slick
about
six
months
ago.
now,
that
would
make
it.
november
1,
1961
in
wanda
and
del’s
tavern.
of
course
the
police
would
not
know
the
significance
of
that
after
six
months
later
but
that
statement
is
one
of
the
things
that
was
withheld
from
the
trial
lawyers.
immediately,
after
getting
his
statement
the
lansing
police
get
their
shotguns
and
automatic
weapon
and
they
go
and
they
raid
wanda
and
del’s
tavern
looking
for
the
man
called
slick
and
he
was
not
there.
they
talked
to
the
owners.
his
name
is
delbert
jones.
“do
you
know
him?”
“yes.”
“can
you
identify
him?”
and
that
is
the
second
thing
that
these
trial
lawyers
do
nothing
about
it.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
that
is
right.
he
can
identify
it.
probably
hauling
around
this
tavern.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
yes,
absolutely.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
no,
sir.
the
name
lyman
moore
does
not
come
in
to
this
yet.
this
is
only
a
man
known
by
nickname
slick
and
that
is
all.
now
the
lansing
police
after
this
raid,
let
us
make
at
may
1,
they
have
an
immediate
suspect
james
e.
watts,
james
e.
"slick"
watts.
nobody
knows
about
that
until
right
near
to
the
end
of
the
post
conviction
hearing
when
the
state
brings
it
out.
and
that's
january
1967.
so
that
is
the
third
thing
that
was
withheld
from
this
trial
matter.
they
did
not
know
that
they
had
an
immediate
suspect
named
james
e.
“slick”
watts.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
that
is
right.
that
comes
right
from
the
chief
of
police.
the
chief
of
police
testified
that
he
assigned
lieutenant
turbin
to
look
for
james
e.
“slick”
watts.
now,
where
he
looked
for
him,
i
do
not
know.
but
they
have
never
found
him.
not
even
to
this
day
as
i
stand
before
you
now
in
1971
or
1972
excuse
me.
that
is
the
third
thing.
now
on
may
1,
1962,
the
lansing
police,
let's
just
recapitulate
little
bit.
they
know
three
people
who
all
know
each
other
and
who
all
know
a
man
named
slick
and
that's
virgle
sanders,
william
leon
thompson
and
delbert
jones,
the
owner
of
wanda
and
del’s.
six
months
later,
petitioner
moore
is
arrested
and
the
lansing
police
photographed
him,
take
the
photograph
over
to
william
leon
thompson's
home.
that
ain't
slick.
it
does
not
resemble
him.
tells
that
to
lieutenant
turbin
sergeant
bandernerd
(ph)
and
they
do
not
tell
that
to
anybody.
excuse
me,
they
do.
they
tell
it
to
the
prosecutors.
they
don't
tell
it
to
the
defense
lawyer.
and
right
after
they
took
petitioner
moore
in
to
custody
they
get
a
report
and
a
kick
back
sheet
from
the
fbi
which
shows
that
petitioner
moore
was
in
a
federal
penitentiary
from
february
18,
1957
to
march
4,
1962.
now,
you
put
that
together
with
the
statement
that
he
originally
gave
and
what
do
you
find
out
that
it
is
impossible
for
him
to
be
the
man
known
as
slick
that
sanders
first
met
in
wanda
and
del’s
owner
about
november
1,
1961.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
no,
he
got
out
march
4,
1962.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
april
25,
1962.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
the
statement
given
by
virgle
sanders
was
given
on
april
30,
1962
at
8:50
pm.
six
months
ago
and
where
does
that
put
him?
when
i
got
this
on
post-conviction
i
asked
virgle
sanders,
“are
you
sure
that
you
met
this
man
slick
before
christmas?”
yes,
i
do
not
like
this
answer
like
you
know
two,
three
months,
four
months,
five
months,
rough
guess,
now
ought
to
pin
him
down
and
i
asked
him,
“are
you
sure
it
was
before
christmas?”
“oh
yes,
i
am
sure.”
and
silly
repeated,
give
him
a
chance
to
get
off
the
hook,
“are
you
definite
that
it
was
before
christmas?”
“oh,
yes”
in
this
record.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
no,
the
man
that
bragged,
the
man
that
voluntarily
confessed
to
this
crime
is
james
e.
slick
watts,
a
man
that
chief
had
assigned
to
look
for
him
and
the
man
that
they
said
at
trial
was
petitioner
moore.
so,
at
the
time
of
the
arrest,
they
know
from
the
kick
back
sheet
from
the
fbi
that
it
is
impossible
for
this
man
to
be
the
man
that
is
in
wanda
and
del’s
on
november
1
and
they
also
in
addition
to
that
know
that
know
that
william
leon
thompson
has
already
told
them
that
he
is
not
the
man.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
that
is
right,
got
into
the
post-conviction.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
that
is
right.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
it
is
impossible
for
him
to
have
knowledge
of
four
things.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
that
is
right.
this
was
not
developed
until
january
1967
and
the
hiring
a
post-conviction,
long
after
the
filed
trial
was
on
in
the
month
of
may
1964
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
virgle
sander.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
that
is
right,
that
is
right.
exactly,
and
that
is
the
most
damaging
testimony
of
all.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
that
is
correct
your
honor
and
neither
is
delbert
jones.
at
the
post-conviction
hearing,
we
show
a
picture
of
james
e.
watts
to
delbert
jones
and
william
leon
thompson
they
both
say
that
slick.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
no,
your
honor.
but
the
different
tavern
altogether
where
this
confession
takes
place
by
a
man
called
slick.
different
tavern
altogether
in
nearby
town.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
you
mean
the?
mr.
james
j.
doherty
well,
they
are
looking
for
a
man
named
slick.
they
have
an
immediate
suspect
james
e
“slick”
watts,
the
lansing
police,
is
that
right.
now
then,
six
month
later
when
they
arrest
petitioner
moore
and
take
his
photograph,
they
take
it
over
to
the
home
of
william
leon
thompson.
that
is
the
man
they
talked,
saturday
morning
who
said,
“yes,
i
know
slick.
yes,
i
can
identify
slick”
on
saturday
morning
april
28,
1962.
now,
november
2nd
or
3rd
they
go
over
his
home
with
the
picture
of
the
petitioner
moore.
they
say,
“here
you
are.”
he
says,
“that
is
not
slick.
that
is
not
him.”
now,
they
did
not
tell
anybody
that,
they
did
not
tell
anybody.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
well
now,
i
would
say
this.
there
are
two
things
that
the
prosecution
knew
definitely
about
and
one
is
that
incident
where
william
leon
thompson
said,
“no,
that
is
not
slick”
he
does
not
resemble
him.
lieutenant
turbin
testified
at
a
post
conviction
hearing
that
he
told
that
to
the
prosecutors.
he
related
that
event
to
the
prosecutors.
so
they
certainly
have
knowledge
of
that.
there
is
another
thing
that
we
are
coming
to
now
that
they
had
knowledge
of
because
it
took
place
right
in
front
of
their
eyes.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
that
is
right,
that
is
exactly
right.
he
said,
“i
know
this
fellow.
i
have
seen
him
a
couple
of
times.
i
only
knew
him
by
nickname
slick.”
and
he
said,
“hey,
is
open
season
on
bartenders.
i
shot
one
in
lansing
last
wednesday
night.
now,
this
is
friday
afternoon.
this
is
29
hours
and
35
minutes
later.”
sure
his
alibi
and
his
work
record
alibi
covered
that
but
who
is
going
to
believe
it
when
the
man
says
“i
know
him.”
the
jury
is
going
to
believe
who?
they
are
going
to
believe
this
man
sanders.
now,
on
post-conviction,
when
i
show
photographs
to
delbert
jones
and
leon
thompson
they
say,
“james
e.
watts
is
the
man
called
slick.
that
is
slick.”
and
when
i
show
the
situation,
“are
you
sure
it
is
before
christmas?”
“yes”,
yes,
we
are
sure
it
is
before
christmas.
i
say
to
sanders,
“now
look,
if
you
would
have
known
that
this
man
moore
was
in
the
federal
penitentiary
until
march
4,
1962,
would
you
have
identified
him
as
the
man
that
you
knew
as
slick?”
and
his
answer
was
“if
he
is
in
jail,
it
would
be
impossible
to
be
the
same
man.”
now,
that
does
not
take
a
great
deal
of
genius
for
me
to
that.
if
they
would
had
that
information
the
trial
lawyers,
they
could
have
done
the
same
thing.
they
could
have
impeached
virgle
sanders
and
virgle
sanders
is
a
material
witness
as
far
as
the
prosecution
is
concerned,
why
is
not
that
evidence,
that
was
withheld
that
would
have
destroyed
the
material.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
who?
yes
they
did.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
they
did
not
get
the
statement.
that
is
what
they
testified
too
under
all
through
the
post
conviction
hearing,
they
did
not
get
that
statement
16.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
that
knows
words
but
yes.
about
six
months
ago.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
right.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
on
april
30th
1962
at
8:50
pm
and
trial
is
on
may
1964
25
months
later.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
i
mean
afterwards,
well,
i
certainly
had
found
like
a
discovery
on
these
people.
i
got
everything
in
their
file.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
they
did
not
have
and
they
testified,
and
they
did
not
see
it,
the
trial
lawyers.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
precisely.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
no,
your
honor,
they
did
not
and
you
know
that
is
dangerous.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
when
a
man
testifies
that
he
knows
this
man,
that
is
bad
enough
about
making
it
worst
and
driving
it
deeper
in,
by
enquiring
how
long
did
you
know.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
well,
you
see
with
the
information
that
i
have
now
and
i
had
at
post-convictions,
then
it
is
sensible
cross
examination
but
without
information
that
is
the
most
dangerous
thing
that
i
could
imagine
to
ask
how
long
you
know.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
well,
the
prosecutor
testified
at
post-conviction
that
he
did
not
remember
whether
statement
16
from
the
lansing
police
department
file
was
turned
over
or
was
in
his
file.
now,
he
never
said
that
he
gave
it
to
the
trial
lawyer,
defense
lawyers
but
he
said,
“i
do
not
recall.
mr.
doherty,
i
will
ask
you
this
way”.
if
it
was
in
my
file,
than
they
saw
it
because
i
showed
them
my
entire
file.
that
is
how
you
put
it?
is
that
your
question
precisely?
mr.
james
j.
doherty
march
4,
1962.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
well,
in
my
mind
it
should
have
your
honor,
it
should
have
had
particular
significance
in
november
1962
when
they
are
going
over
and
they
are
talking
to
william
leon
thompson
because
by
then
they
have
the
kick
back
sheet
from
the
fbi
and
the
fbi
shows
it
and
all
you
have
got
to
do
is
just
look
at
it.
six
months
ago
from
april
it
makes
it
november
1,
1962
when
the
fbi
report
shows
did
not
get
out
until
march
4,
1962.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
well,
i
say
that
is
imputable
to
the
police
under
the
word
of
barbee,
and
that
is
a
law
of
question.
i
have
not
talked
about
that.
let
us
get
to
the
last
thing
and
that
will
help
a
lot.
here
they
are
now.
they
know
all
these
things
and
yet
they
do
not
bring
in
virgle
sanders
to
look
at
this
man.
they
do
not
bring
in
delbert
jones.
they
just
close
their
eyes
for
18
months
to
the
truth.
your
honor,
as
he
told
us
time
and
again,
a
trial
is
a
search
for
the
truth.
they
close
their
eyes
to
the
truth.
when
virgle
sanders
first
saw
petitioner
moore,
the
day
before
he
testified
at
the
trial
he
takes
a
look
at
it
and
he
says,
“the
guy
that
i
knew
as
slick
looked
to
be
about
30
or
40
pound
heavier
than
this
guy.”
now,
that
was
in
the
presence
of
the
lansing
police
officers
and
the
prosecutors
and
the
lansing
police
officers
said,
“well,
you
know
how
those
jailhouse
beans
are.”
that
is
item
five
and
that
is
actively
encouraging
virgle
sanders
to
falsely
identify
the
petitioner
moore
as
the
man
called
slick
and
that
was
in
the
presence
of
the
prosecutor.
so
the
prosecutors
know
now
of
two
things.
they
know
of
that
because
they
were
there
and
they
know
about
william
leon
thompson
saying
“no,
that
is
not
slick”.
and
at
the
post-conviction
hearing
--
mr.
james
j.
doherty
i
can't
--
mr.
james
j.
doherty
when
he
turned
it
over
to
the
defense
lawyers
that
is
in
dispute.
on
the
post
conviction
hearing
they
said
that
he
did
not
and
when
he
testified
he
says
i
do
not
remember
who
was
in
there.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
i
say
no.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
okay,
fine.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
i
do
not
say
that,
it
might
have
been.
you
want
to
assume
that
they
turned
it
over?
it
might
have
been.
perfectly
willing
to
stipulate
to
that
but
one
thing
we
know
is
this
that
is
all
that
could
have
been
in
there,
not
the
other
four
thing
because
they
were
not
reported.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
the
statement?
mr.
james
j.
doherty
i
think
it
was
in
there.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
that
is
what
they
said,
that
is
what
he
said,
yes
but
the
defense
lawyers
denied
it.
he
said
he
turn
it
over
to
one
of
the
defense
lawyers.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
they
said
there
was
no
request
or
suppressed
information
during
trial
and
the
record
reflects
that
the
prosecutors
showed
his
entire
files
to
and
that
is
what
you
are
bound
by
now,
that
file.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
i
do
not
say
so
but
the
--
mr.
james
j.
doherty
that
is
right,
they
found
it
and
they
found
that
there
was
no
request
during
trial
for
the
suppressed
information.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
the
prosecution
knew
of
the
statement.
or
we
have
to
assume
they
knew
of
the
statement.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
no,
all
we
got
to
do
is
take
a
look
at
the
way
in
which
he
questioned
sanders.
the
prosecutor
questioned
sanders.
actually
put
him
on
a
cross
examine,
that
is
what
he
did.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
i
am
not
going
to
say
that.
i
don't
have
to
be
that
extravagant
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
that
is
only
of
five.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
that
is
right.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
they
testify
that
they
did
not
and
the
most
that
the
prosecutor
testified
to
a
post-conviction
was,
well,
he
does
not
remember
was
in
there
if
it
was
in
there,
then
they
got
it.
and
that
is
the
record
before
you
know.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
yes,
the
gun,
very
good
for
the
gun.
all
right,
the
gun.
now,
they
introduced
a
16
gauge
gun,
bill
of
particulars,
phase
two
of
the
abstract.
“what
kind
of
a
gun
killed
this
man?”
“12
gauge”
answer
by
the
prosecutors
that
tried
his
case,
a
12
gauge.
they
have
in
their
file
at
all
times,
a
report
from
the
chicago
scientific
crime
detection
laboratory
by
sergeant
benz
(ph)
that
the
wadding
dug
out
of
his
chest
that
was
siezed
from
12
gauge-shell.
i
have
two
little
pillboxes
here
and
i
am
telling
you,
you
can
put
a
16
gauge-shell
into
a
12
gauge
chamber
and
it
is
a
little
danger,
it
is
a
little
loose,
you
should
not
do
it
but
no
way
in
god's
world
can
you
put
a
12
gauge-shell
in
to
a
16
gauge.
it
is
the
impossible.
you
could
not
do
with
the
hydraulic
press
and
if
you
can,
i
will
let
you
shoot
me
with
it.
now,
that
the
12
gauge
gun
and
you
know
the
(inaudible)
had
nothing
to
do
with
him.
it
came
from
the
back
seat
of
the
car
owned
by
barbee,
the
sort
of
girl
was
found
under
the
bed
in
barbee’s
home.
so
therefore,
what
you
got
at
most
is
propensity
evidence
of
another
and
in
spencer
versus
texas
in
the
dissenting
opinion
and
all
of
the
authority
cited
in
there
they
said,
“you
cannot
use
propensity
evidence.”
they
did
it.
they
denounced
this
man
a
bad
man
generally.
jim
flemming
stood
in
front
of
that
jury
and
he
said
to
them,
“this
is
not
the
gun.”
no,
question
about
the
folks
this
is
not
the
gun.
now,
they
say
it
could
be.
but
jim
flemming
said
this
is
not
the
gun.
no
question
about
the
folks.
but
anybody
that
is
with
a
man
who
has
this
kind
of
gun
and
look
at
those
shells,
he
deserves
a
death
penalty,
that
is
what
he
told
them
that
and
that
was
wrong,
he
should
not
have
done
that.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
your
honors?
mr.
james
j.
doherty
i
did
not
call
robert
fair
because
all
he
said
that
he
looked
like
one
of
the
man.
when
bill
joyce
was
called
back
on
the
post-conviction
by
stipulation
he
testified
he
sure
looks
different,
looks
like
a
minister’s
son.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
now,
virgle
sanders
knew
of
him,
so
why
bring
in
the
people
that
did
know
but
one
fellow
told
the
police
that
he
sure
looked
different,
that
is
not
in
the
record
because
you
cannot
get
all
of
this
from
the
record.
and
the
gun,
it
is
terribly
denigrating
to
the
chicago
scientific
crime
detection
laboratory,
a
scientist
said
it
comes
from
12-gauge.
all
you
got
to
do
is
buy
the
shooters
bible
or
sport's
field
or
anything
to
find
out
the
differences
a
great
deal,
330
seconds
of
an
inch
between
the
12-gauge
wadding
and
the
16-gauge
wadding.
and
it
is
not
a
legal
argument,
it
is
an
argument
based
on
the
immutable
laws
of
the
universe,
the
exact
science
of
measurements.
mr.
anderson
stated
at
trial
that
his
opinion
that
if
lyman
moore
was
missing
for
any
length
of
time,
he
would
have
notice
him
being
missing.
he
says
that
these
people
have
been
asked
to
make
the
statements,
asked
to
make
the
statements.
there
was
a
written
motion
for
all
statements
given
to
the
lansing
police.
there
was
a
promise
by
the
prosecutors
on
page
32
of
the
record.
we
will
give
them
to
him
when
the
witness
is
finishing
testifying
on
direct
examination
your
honor
and
they
did
with
two.
pat
hill
gave
voluntarily.
henley
powell
gave
the
statement
voluntarily
but
did
not
fulfill
their
promise
of
virgle
sanders.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
after
they
got
them
up
to
sanders
that
after
they
got
done
testifying
and
so
when
they
asked
about
the
statements,
they
had
the
statements
in
their
hand
that
they
were
cross
examining
from
them
and
that
was
after
not
before
and
the
record
makes
that
clear.
i
stand
to
answer
question.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
prosecution
for
murder,
the
state
concealed
six
items
of
exonerating
evidence
and
used
a
weapon
that
was
not
connected
with
the
petitioner
moore
or
the
offense,
that
announced
him
as
a
bad
man
generally
and
the
jury
that
had
been
selected
in
violation
of
witherspoon
standards
found
petitioner
guilty
and
fixed
his
punishment
of
death.
this
case
begins
at
10
pm
on
wednesday,
april
25,
1962.
a
bartender
in
lansing,
illinois
ejected
a
profane
customer
on
this
tavern.
at
10:55
pm
that
customer
rushed
back
in
with
a
twelve
gauge
shot
gun
and
shot
him
in
the
heart
and
killed
him.
two
days
later
in
the
nearby
tavern
a
man
known
only
by
the
nickname
slick
bragged
that
he
had
shot
the
bartender
in
lansing.
trial
was
held
25
months
later.
two
state
witnesses
identified
petitioner
moore
as
the
assailant.
two
of
his
employers
testified
that
he
was
at
work
50
miles
north
of
lansing,
illinois
in
wilmette
country
club
until
after
midnight.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
lansing
is
south
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
chicago,
riverdale,
dolton,
south
holland,
lansing.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
well,
i
do
not
know
your
honor.
i
would
say
it
about
the
27
to
30
miles
and
a
little
bit
east.
this
is
far
southeast
you
should
not
get
to
(inaudible)
and
wilmette
is
way
north
and
this
was
before
we
had
that
dan
ryan
expressway
opened
up.
you
could
not
have
got
there
50
miles
except
by
going
through
small
side
streets
of
that,
but
nothing
open,
of
course
the
auto
drive
is
open.
now,
opposing
those
two
people
that
said
that
he
was
the
assailant,
that
these
employers
and
verified
by
the
work
records,
he
was
paid
overtime,
worked
till
after
midnight
that
night.
the
most
damaging
evidence
against
this
man
moore
on
the
testimony
of
state
witness
virgle
sanders.
virgle
sanders
identified
the
petitioner
moore
as
a
man
that
he
knew,
a
man
that
he
had
seen
several
times
before,
but
knew
only
by
the
nickname
slick.
he
testified
that
on
friday
afternoon,
1:30
pm,
that
is
less
than
40
hours
after
this
killing,
this
man
slick
was
in
the
tavern,
ponderosa
tavern
and
said
to
him
“hey,
virgle,
it's
open
season
on
bartenders.
i
shot
one
in
the
lansing
on
last
wednesday
night.”
now
five
of
the
concealed
items
of
exonerating
evidence
involved
virgle
sanders.
they
were
uncovered
in
the
post
conviction
hearing
that
took
place
on
january
1967.
friday
night,
i
mean
friday
afternoon,
april
27th
at
1:30
pm
that
is
the
bragging
incident.
really
the
voluntary
confession
of
this
man
slick
that
he
killed
the
bartender.
next
day,
saturday,
a
lansing
police
are
in
that
ponderosa
tap
in
their
clock
in
to
a
man
named
william,
leon
thomson.
“did
you
hear
about
it?”
“oh,
yes
he
heard
about
it.”
“can
you
identify
slick?”
“yes,
i
can.”
monday,
april
30,
1962
8:50
pm,
sanders
is
in
the
police
station
of
lansing
and
he
is
giving
the
statement
and
tells
the
police
that
he
first
met
slick
about
six
months
ago.
now,
that
would
make
it.
november
1,
1961
in
wanda
and
del’s
tavern.
of
course
the
police
would
not
know
the
significance
of
that
after
six
months
later
but
that
statement
is
one
of
the
things
that
was
withheld
from
the
trial
lawyers.
immediately,
after
getting
his
statement
the
lansing
police
get
their
shotguns
and
automatic
weapon
and
they
go
and
they
raid
wanda
and
del’s
tavern
looking
for
the
man
called
slick
and
he
was
not
there.
they
talked
to
the
owners.
his
name
is
delbert
jones.
“do
you
know
him?”
“yes.”
“can
you
identify
him?”
and
that
is
the
second
thing
that
these
trial
lawyers
do
nothing
about
it.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
that
is
right.
he
can
identify
it.
probably
hauling
around
this
tavern.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
yes,
absolutely.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
no,
sir.
the
name
lyman
moore
does
not
come
in
to
this
yet.
this
is
only
a
man
known
by
nickname
slick
and
that
is
all.
now
the
lansing
police
after
this
raid,
let
us
make
at
may
1,
they
have
an
immediate
suspect
james
e.
watts,
james
e.
"slick"
watts.
nobody
knows
about
that
until
right
near
to
the
end
of
the
post
conviction
hearing
when
the
state
brings
it
out.
and
that's
january
1967.
so
that
is
the
third
thing
that
was
withheld
from
this
trial
matter.
they
did
not
know
that
they
had
an
immediate
suspect
named
james
e.
“slick”
watts.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
that
is
right.
that
comes
right
from
the
chief
of
police.
the
chief
of
police
testified
that
he
assigned
lieutenant
turbin
to
look
for
james
e.
“slick”
watts.
now,
where
he
looked
for
him,
i
do
not
know.
but
they
have
never
found
him.
not
even
to
this
day
as
i
stand
before
you
now
in
1971
or
1972
excuse
me.
that
is
the
third
thing.
now
on
may
1,
1962,
the
lansing
police,
let's
just
recapitulate
little
bit.
they
know
three
people
who
all
know
each
other
and
who
all
know
a
man
named
slick
and
that's
virgle
sanders,
william
leon
thompson
and
delbert
jones,
the
owner
of
wanda
and
del’s.
six
months
later,
petitioner
moore
is
arrested
and
the
lansing
police
photographed
him,
take
the
photograph
over
to
william
leon
thompson's
home.
that
ain't
slick.
it
does
not
resemble
him.
tells
that
to
lieutenant
turbin
sergeant
bandernerd
(ph)
and
they
do
not
tell
that
to
anybody.
excuse
me,
they
do.
they
tell
it
to
the
prosecutors.
they
don't
tell
it
to
the
defense
lawyer.
and
right
after
they
took
petitioner
moore
in
to
custody
they
get
a
report
and
a
kick
back
sheet
from
the
fbi
which
shows
that
petitioner
moore
was
in
a
federal
penitentiary
from
february
18,
1957
to
march
4,
1962.
now,
you
put
that
together
with
the
statement
that
he
originally
gave
and
what
do
you
find
out
that
it
is
impossible
for
him
to
be
the
man
known
as
slick
that
sanders
first
met
in
wanda
and
del’s
owner
about
november
1,
1961.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
no,
he
got
out
march
4,
1962.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
april
25,
1962.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
the
statement
given
by
virgle
sanders
was
given
on
april
30,
1962
at
8:50
pm.
six
months
ago
and
where
does
that
put
him?
when
i
got
this
on
post-conviction
i
asked
virgle
sanders,
“are
you
sure
that
you
met
this
man
slick
before
christmas?”
yes,
i
do
not
like
this
answer
like
you
know
two,
three
months,
four
months,
five
months,
rough
guess,
now
ought
to
pin
him
down
and
i
asked
him,
“are
you
sure
it
was
before
christmas?”
“oh
yes,
i
am
sure.”
and
silly
repeated,
give
him
a
chance
to
get
off
the
hook,
“are
you
definite
that
it
was
before
christmas?”
“oh,
yes”
in
this
record.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
no,
the
man
that
bragged,
the
man
that
voluntarily
confessed
to
this
crime
is
james
e.
slick
watts,
a
man
that
chief
had
assigned
to
look
for
him
and
the
man
that
they
said
at
trial
was
petitioner
moore.
so,
at
the
time
of
the
arrest,
they
know
from
the
kick
back
sheet
from
the
fbi
that
it
is
impossible
for
this
man
to
be
the
man
that
is
in
wanda
and
del’s
on
november
1
and
they
also
in
addition
to
that
know
that
know
that
william
leon
thompson
has
already
told
them
that
he
is
not
the
man.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
that
is
right,
got
into
the
post-conviction.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
that
is
right.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
it
is
impossible
for
him
to
have
knowledge
of
four
things.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
that
is
right.
this
was
not
developed
until
january
1967
and
the
hiring
a
post-conviction,
long
after
the
filed
trial
was
on
in
the
month
of
may
1964
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
virgle
sander.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
that
is
right,
that
is
right.
exactly,
and
that
is
the
most
damaging
testimony
of
all.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
that
is
correct
your
honor
and
neither
is
delbert
jones.
at
the
post-conviction
hearing,
we
show
a
picture
of
james
e.
watts
to
delbert
jones
and
william
leon
thompson
they
both
say
that
slick.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
no,
your
honor.
but
the
different
tavern
altogether
where
this
confession
takes
place
by
a
man
called
slick.
different
tavern
altogether
in
nearby
town.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
you
mean
the?
mr.
james
j.
doherty
well,
they
are
looking
for
a
man
named
slick.
they
have
an
immediate
suspect
james
e
“slick”
watts,
the
lansing
police,
is
that
right.
now
then,
six
month
later
when
they
arrest
petitioner
moore
and
take
his
photograph,
they
take
it
over
to
the
home
of
william
leon
thompson.
that
is
the
man
they
talked,
saturday
morning
who
said,
“yes,
i
know
slick.
yes,
i
can
identify
slick”
on
saturday
morning
april
28,
1962.
now,
november
2nd
or
3rd
they
go
over
his
home
with
the
picture
of
the
petitioner
moore.
they
say,
“here
you
are.”
he
says,
“that
is
not
slick.
that
is
not
him.”
now,
they
did
not
tell
anybody
that,
they
did
not
tell
anybody.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
well
now,
i
would
say
this.
there
are
two
things
that
the
prosecution
knew
definitely
about
and
one
is
that
incident
where
william
leon
thompson
said,
“no,
that
is
not
slick”
he
does
not
resemble
him.
lieutenant
turbin
testified
at
a
post
conviction
hearing
that
he
told
that
to
the
prosecutors.
he
related
that
event
to
the
prosecutors.
so
they
certainly
have
knowledge
of
that.
there
is
another
thing
that
we
are
coming
to
now
that
they
had
knowledge
of
because
it
took
place
right
in
front
of
their
eyes.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
that
is
right,
that
is
exactly
right.
he
said,
“i
know
this
fellow.
i
have
seen
him
a
couple
of
times.
i
only
knew
him
by
nickname
slick.”
and
he
said,
“hey,
is
open
season
on
bartenders.
i
shot
one
in
lansing
last
wednesday
night.
now,
this
is
friday
afternoon.
this
is
29
hours
and
35
minutes
later.”
sure
his
alibi
and
his
work
record
alibi
covered
that
but
who
is
going
to
believe
it
when
the
man
says
“i
know
him.”
the
jury
is
going
to
believe
who?
they
are
going
to
believe
this
man
sanders.
now,
on
post-conviction,
when
i
show
photographs
to
delbert
jones
and
leon
thompson
they
say,
“james
e.
watts
is
the
man
called
slick.
that
is
slick.”
and
when
i
show
the
situation,
“are
you
sure
it
is
before
christmas?”
“yes”,
yes,
we
are
sure
it
is
before
christmas.
i
say
to
sanders,
“now
look,
if
you
would
have
known
that
this
man
moore
was
in
the
federal
penitentiary
until
march
4,
1962,
would
you
have
identified
him
as
the
man
that
you
knew
as
slick?”
and
his
answer
was
“if
he
is
in
jail,
it
would
be
impossible
to
be
the
same
man.”
now,
that
does
not
take
a
great
deal
of
genius
for
me
to
that.
if
they
would
had
that
information
the
trial
lawyers,
they
could
have
done
the
same
thing.
they
could
have
impeached
virgle
sanders
and
virgle
sanders
is
a
material
witness
as
far
as
the
prosecution
is
concerned,
why
is
not
that
evidence,
that
was
withheld
that
would
have
destroyed
the
material.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
who?
yes
they
did.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
they
did
not
get
the
statement.
that
is
what
they
testified
too
under
all
through
the
post
conviction
hearing,
they
did
not
get
that
statement
16.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
that
knows
words
but
yes.
about
six
months
ago.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
right.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
on
april
30th
1962
at
8:50
pm
and
trial
is
on
may
1964
25
months
later.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
i
mean
afterwards,
well,
i
certainly
had
found
like
a
discovery
on
these
people.
i
got
everything
in
their
file.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
they
did
not
have
and
they
testified,
and
they
did
not
see
it,
the
trial
lawyers.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
precisely.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
no,
your
honor,
they
did
not
and
you
know
that
is
dangerous.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
when
a
man
testifies
that
he
knows
this
man,
that
is
bad
enough
about
making
it
worst
and
driving
it
deeper
in,
by
enquiring
how
long
did
you
know.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
well,
you
see
with
the
information
that
i
have
now
and
i
had
at
post-convictions,
then
it
is
sensible
cross
examination
but
without
information
that
is
the
most
dangerous
thing
that
i
could
imagine
to
ask
how
long
you
know.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
well,
the
prosecutor
testified
at
post-conviction
that
he
did
not
remember
whether
statement
16
from
the
lansing
police
department
file
was
turned
over
or
was
in
his
file.
now,
he
never
said
that
he
gave
it
to
the
trial
lawyer,
defense
lawyers
but
he
said,
“i
do
not
recall.
mr.
doherty,
i
will
ask
you
this
way”.
if
it
was
in
my
file,
than
they
saw
it
because
i
showed
them
my
entire
file.
that
is
how
you
put
it?
is
that
your
question
precisely?
mr.
james
j.
doherty
march
4,
1962.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
well,
in
my
mind
it
should
have
your
honor,
it
should
have
had
particular
significance
in
november
1962
when
they
are
going
over
and
they
are
talking
to
william
leon
thompson
because
by
then
they
have
the
kick
back
sheet
from
the
fbi
and
the
fbi
shows
it
and
all
you
have
got
to
do
is
just
look
at
it.
six
months
ago
from
april
it
makes
it
november
1,
1962
when
the
fbi
report
shows
did
not
get
out
until
march
4,
1962.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
well,
i
say
that
is
imputable
to
the
police
under
the
word
of
barbee,
and
that
is
a
law
of
question.
i
have
not
talked
about
that.
let
us
get
to
the
last
thing
and
that
will
help
a
lot.
here
they
are
now.
they
know
all
these
things
and
yet
they
do
not
bring
in
virgle
sanders
to
look
at
this
man.
they
do
not
bring
in
delbert
jones.
they
just
close
their
eyes
for
18
months
to
the
truth.
your
honor,
as
he
told
us
time
and
again,
a
trial
is
a
search
for
the
truth.
they
close
their
eyes
to
the
truth.
when
virgle
sanders
first
saw
petitioner
moore,
the
day
before
he
testified
at
the
trial
he
takes
a
look
at
it
and
he
says,
“the
guy
that
i
knew
as
slick
looked
to
be
about
30
or
40
pound
heavier
than
this
guy.”
now,
that
was
in
the
presence
of
the
lansing
police
officers
and
the
prosecutors
and
the
lansing
police
officers
said,
“well,
you
know
how
those
jailhouse
beans
are.”
that
is
item
five
and
that
is
actively
encouraging
virgle
sanders
to
falsely
identify
the
petitioner
moore
as
the
man
called
slick
and
that
was
in
the
presence
of
the
prosecutor.
so
the
prosecutors
know
now
of
two
things.
they
know
of
that
because
they
were
there
and
they
know
about
william
leon
thompson
saying
“no,
that
is
not
slick”.
and
at
the
post-conviction
hearing
--
mr.
james
j.
doherty
i
can't
--
mr.
james
j.
doherty
when
he
turned
it
over
to
the
defense
lawyers
that
is
in
dispute.
on
the
post
conviction
hearing
they
said
that
he
did
not
and
when
he
testified
he
says
i
do
not
remember
who
was
in
there.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
i
say
no.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
okay,
fine.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
i
do
not
say
that,
it
might
have
been.
you
want
to
assume
that
they
turned
it
over?
it
might
have
been.
perfectly
willing
to
stipulate
to
that
but
one
thing
we
know
is
this
that
is
all
that
could
have
been
in
there,
not
the
other
four
thing
because
they
were
not
reported.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
the
statement?
mr.
james
j.
doherty
i
think
it
was
in
there.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
that
is
what
they
said,
that
is
what
he
said,
yes
but
the
defense
lawyers
denied
it.
he
said
he
turn
it
over
to
one
of
the
defense
lawyers.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
they
said
there
was
no
request
or
suppressed
information
during
trial
and
the
record
reflects
that
the
prosecutors
showed
his
entire
files
to
and
that
is
what
you
are
bound
by
now,
that
file.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
i
do
not
say
so
but
the
--
mr.
james
j.
doherty
that
is
right,
they
found
it
and
they
found
that
there
was
no
request
during
trial
for
the
suppressed
information.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
the
prosecution
knew
of
the
statement.
or
we
have
to
assume
they
knew
of
the
statement.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
no,
all
we
got
to
do
is
take
a
look
at
the
way
in
which
he
questioned
sanders.
the
prosecutor
questioned
sanders.
actually
put
him
on
a
cross
examine,
that
is
what
he
did.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
i
am
not
going
to
say
that.
i
don't
have
to
be
that
extravagant
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
that
is
only
of
five.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
that
is
right.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
they
testify
that
they
did
not
and
the
most
that
the
prosecutor
testified
to
a
post-conviction
was,
well,
he
does
not
remember
was
in
there
if
it
was
in
there,
then
they
got
it.
and
that
is
the
record
before
you
know.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
yes,
the
gun,
very
good
for
the
gun.
all
right,
the
gun.
now,
they
introduced
a
16
gauge
gun,
bill
of
particulars,
phase
two
of
the
abstract.
“what
kind
of
a
gun
killed
this
man?”
“12
gauge”
answer
by
the
prosecutors
that
tried
his
case,
a
12
gauge.
they
have
in
their
file
at
all
times,
a
report
from
the
chicago
scientific
crime
detection
laboratory
by
sergeant
benz
(ph)
that
the
wadding
dug
out
of
his
chest
that
was
siezed
from
12
gauge-shell.
i
have
two
little
pillboxes
here
and
i
am
telling
you,
you
can
put
a
16
gauge-shell
into
a
12
gauge
chamber
and
it
is
a
little
danger,
it
is
a
little
loose,
you
should
not
do
it
but
no
way
in
god's
world
can
you
put
a
12
gauge-shell
in
to
a
16
gauge.
it
is
the
impossible.
you
could
not
do
with
the
hydraulic
press
and
if
you
can,
i
will
let
you
shoot
me
with
it.
now,
that
the
12
gauge
gun
and
you
know
the
(inaudible)
had
nothing
to
do
with
him.
it
came
from
the
back
seat
of
the
car
owned
by
barbee,
the
sort
of
girl
was
found
under
the
bed
in
barbee’s
home.
so
therefore,
what
you
got
at
most
is
propensity
evidence
of
another
and
in
spencer
versus
texas
in
the
dissenting
opinion
and
all
of
the
authority
cited
in
there
they
said,
“you
cannot
use
propensity
evidence.”
they
did
it.
they
denounced
this
man
a
bad
man
generally.
jim
flemming
stood
in
front
of
that
jury
and
he
said
to
them,
“this
is
not
the
gun.”
no,
question
about
the
folks
this
is
not
the
gun.
now,
they
say
it
could
be.
but
jim
flemming
said
this
is
not
the
gun.
no
question
about
the
folks.
but
anybody
that
is
with
a
man
who
has
this
kind
of
gun
and
look
at
those
shells,
he
deserves
a
death
penalty,
that
is
what
he
told
them
that
and
that
was
wrong,
he
should
not
have
done
that.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
your
honors?
mr.
james
j.
doherty
i
did
not
call
robert
fair
because
all
he
said
that
he
looked
like
one
of
the
man.
when
bill
joyce
was
called
back
on
the
post-conviction
by
stipulation
he
testified
he
sure
looks
different,
looks
like
a
minister’s
son.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
now,
virgle
sanders
knew
of
him,
so
why
bring
in
the
people
that
did
know
but
one
fellow
told
the
police
that
he
sure
looked
different,
that
is
not
in
the
record
because
you
cannot
get
all
of
this
from
the
record.
and
the
gun,
it
is
terribly
denigrating
to
the
chicago
scientific
crime
detection
laboratory,
a
scientist
said
it
comes
from
12-gauge.
all
you
got
to
do
is
buy
the
shooters
bible
or
sport's
field
or
anything
to
find
out
the
differences
a
great
deal,
330
seconds
of
an
inch
between
the
12-gauge
wadding
and
the
16-gauge
wadding.
and
it
is
not
a
legal
argument,
it
is
an
argument
based
on
the
immutable
laws
of
the
universe,
the
exact
science
of
measurements.
mr.
anderson
stated
at
trial
that
his
opinion
that
if
lyman
moore
was
missing
for
any
length
of
time,
he
would
have
notice
him
being
missing.
he
says
that
these
people
have
been
asked
to
make
the
statements,
asked
to
make
the
statements.
there
was
a
written
motion
for
all
statements
given
to
the
lansing
police.
there
was
a
promise
by
the
prosecutors
on
page
32
of
the
record.
we
will
give
them
to
him
when
the
witness
is
finishing
testifying
on
direct
examination
your
honor
and
they
did
with
two.
pat
hill
gave
voluntarily.
henley
powell
gave
the
statement
voluntarily
but
did
not
fulfill
their
promise
of
virgle
sanders.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
after
they
got
them
up
to
sanders
that
after
they
got
done
testifying
and
so
when
they
asked
about
the
statements,
they
had
the
statements
in
their
hand
that
they
were
cross
examining
from
them
and
that
was
after
not
before
and
the
record
makes
that
clear.
i
stand
to
answer
question.
thank
you
your
honor.
