mr.
james
e.
milliman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
i
would
like
to
reserve
five
minutes
for
rebuttal,
if
i
may.
the
facts
to
this
case
are
--
mr.
james
e.
milliman
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
facts
to
this
case
are
as
follows.
the
petitioner
willie
mae
barker
was
indicted
in
september
of
1958
for
the
murder
of
orlena
denton,
a
vicious
heinous
crime
which
he
was
accused
of
bursting
into
her
bedroom
and
beat
her
to
death
with
a
tire
iron
with
an
accomplice
one
silas
manning
who
becomes
very
relevant.
his
case
was
originally
set
for
trial
in
october
of
1958.
however,
there
occurred
a
series
of
16
continuances
granted
the
prosecution
in
this
case.
willie
mae
barker
was
not
brought
to
trial
until
october
of
1963,
a
delay
in
excess
of
five
years.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
counsel
was
appointed
right
after
indictment,
your
honor.
he
was
represented
by
counsel
throughout
this
delay.
we
have
no
complaint
in
this
regard.
petitioner
--
mr.
james
e.
milliman
yes,
your
honor.
he
had
full
notice
to
these
motions
for
continuances.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
the
record
does
not
show
whether
he
was
present
your
honor
for
this
continuances.
there
was
no
objection
made
to
these
continuances
until
1962.
at
which
point
counsel
started
objecting
to
this
continuances.
but
barker
was
released
on
bail.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
i
believe
there
were
four
or
five,
your
honor.
they
began
--
the
first
motion
to
dismiss
in
this
case
was
filed
on
february
12,
1962
and
this
is
on
page
9
of
the
appendix
and
thereafter
the
counsel
for
willie
mae
barker
at
that
time
objected
to
further
continuances.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
yes,
your
honor.
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
and
both
in
the
sixth
circuit
held
it
was
1963
that
this
motion
was
made
february
12,
1963
but
the
--
and
where
they
found
this
date
i
have
no
knowledge,
the
record
clearly
shows
it
was
made
on
february
12,
1962.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
yes
your
honor
but
the
district
court,
it's
ironic
to
district
court
on
page
22
of
the
appendix
pointed
out
that
the
motion
was
made
in
february
26,
1962
then
talked
about
the
resulting
eight
months
delay
but
the
delay
was
a
resulting
19
months
delay.
so
there
is
confusion
as
to
this
date.
the
petitioner
was
released
on
$5,000.00
bond
in
june
of
1959
and
remained
free
on
$5,000.00
bond
until
he
was
finally
convicted.
petitioner
then
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
kentucky
alleging
he
was
denied
as
right
to
a
speedy
trial
and
other
errors
in
the
trial
court.
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
conviction
then
later
petitioner
filed
this
habeas
corpus
proceeding
in
the
district
court,
the
western
district
of
kentucky
which
denied
relief.
he
appealed
to
this
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
which
affirmed
the
district
court
decision
and
this
court
granted
certiorari
january
18th
of
this
year.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
decided
this
case
on
two
grounds.
they
held
that
petitioner
had
waived
his
right
to
a
speedy
trial
by
failing
to
demand
trial.
that
the
demand
rule
states
that
the
right
to
a
speedy
trial
is
guaranteed
by
the
sixth
amendment
is
a
personal
right
which
may
be
weighed.
so
the
sixth
circuit
computed
only
the
time
after
the
first
motion
to
dismiss
was
made
in
computing
the
length
of
the
delay
which
had
found
to
be
nine
months
using
the
1963
date.
it
also
held
that
petitioner
had
not
shown
that
he
was
prejudice
by
the
delay.
petitioner's
therefore
raised
two
points
on
this
appeal.
first
that
the
demand
rule
is
inconsistent
with
constitutional
safeguards
and
should
not
be
required
and
the
second
issue
is
where
there
is
a
five
year
delay,
prejudice
should
be
presumed
as
inherent
in
the
delay
and
it's
important
to
emphasize
in
this
case
the
two
amicus
briefs
have
been
filed.
we
are
concerned
in
this
case
with
a
five-year
delay.
we
are
not
concerned
with
a
one
year
delay
or
two-year
delay.
this
case
presents
a
five-year
delay.
the
demand
rule
is
applied
in
this
case,
is
subject
to
attack
on
two
grounds.
this
court
has
consistently
held
that
any
waiver
of
a
constitutional
right
must
be
voluntary
and
intelligent
knowing
and
that
it
will
not
accept
a
passive
waiver
--
mr.
james
e.
milliman
this
is
correct
your
honor.
and
--
mr.
james
e.
milliman
your
honor
in
the
present
case,
it
is
contended
that
the
demand
rule
as
such
chills
his
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
we
had
a
man
here
who
was
indicted
for
willful
murder.
now
his
accomplice
had
twice
received
the
death
penalty.
this
put
him
in
the
position
of
--
if
he
has
to
demand
trial
to
protect
his
right
to
a
speedy
trial,
he
has
possibly
asking
himself,
asking
the
prosecution
to
give
him
the
electric
chair.
the
result
if
he
is
successful
is
death,
this
is
a
grisly
choice
which
this
court
condemned
in
faye
versus
noia,
where
--
mr.
james
e.
milliman
your
honor,
your
question
if
i
understand
it,
supposed
you
said
the
right
is
a
personal
right
which
can
be
waived.
now,
we
are
contending
that
to
ask
him
to
demand
trial
on
the
face
of
the
death
sentence
is
putting
him
in
the
same
position
that
the
defendant
was
in,
in
faye
versus
noia.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
it
may
well
be
that
trial
is
the
last
thing
he
wants
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
no
we
are
not
arguing
this.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
well,
this
is
correct
and
i
think
this
would
be
desired
by
any
defendant.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
this
is
what
we're
contending,
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
then
we
would
have
an
entirely
different
situation.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
in
this
case,
the
defendant
did
not
in
any
way
contribute
to
the
delay.
he
had
made
no
continuance
himself,
he
made
no
dilatory
motions.
he
merely
--
mr.
james
e.
milliman
in
that
event
your
honor,
he
would
have
affirmatively
contributed
to
the
delay.
he
would
have
brought
it
about
by
his
own
affirmative
actions
by
merely
sitting
back
and
doing
nothing.
he
did
nothing
to
contribute
to
the
delay.
now
he
did
file
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
february
12,
1962.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
your
honor,
in
that
event
i
would
think
there
would
be
less,
far
less
of
a
constitutional
objection,
in
that
case
we
would
still
have
this
grisly
choice.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
i
would
contend
in
that
event
that
it
would
still
be
unconstitutional
but
for
less
sufficient
reason
because
there
is
another
impelling
reason
in
this
case.
when
must
the
demand
be
made?
the
demand
or
rule
or
set
of
standard,
it
says
a
petitioner,
a
defendant
must
demand
trial.
but
when
must
he
make
that
demand,
there
are
no
guidelines,
there
are
no
standards.
florida
has
past
a
statute
that
says
after
three
successive
demands
--
mr.
james
e.
milliman
this
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
your
honor,
there
are
system
of
jurisprudence
and
burden
of
prosecution
is
on
the
state.
to
require
this
man,
willie
mae
barker
to
demand
trial
is
imposing
the
burden
upon
him
to
bring
about
trial
to
prove
his
innocence.
this
is
contrary
to
establish
principles
in
this
country.
he
should
not
have
the
burden
of
bringing
to
that
trial.
this
is
the
burden
of
the
prosecution.
it
is
there
duty,
the
american
bar
association
has
disapproved
that
the
"demand
rule"
for
this
reason
that
the
burden
is
on
the
prosecution
to
bring
trial
not
on
the
defendant.
but
when
does
the
defendant
demand
trial?
must
he
demand
trial
at
the
indictment
after
a
year
at
every
term
of
court?
any
waiver
of
a
constitutional
right
must
be
made
intelligently.
now,
petitioner
was
represented
by
counsel.
but
i
submit
that
even
though
he
is
represented
by
counsel,
his
counsel
couldn't
determine
when
the
demand
must
be
made.
what
if
it
would
have
been
made
at
the
indictment
and
no
other
demand
had
been
made.
what
if
it's
done
in
many
cases?
in
other
words,
what
the
demand
rule
is,
it's
treating
the
constitutional
right
as
a
procedural
nicety
which
can
be
waive
like
they
knew
if
you
fail
to
demand
it.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
well,
your
honor
we
submit
that
the
burden
--
since
the
burden
is
on
the
state
to
bring
about
trial
but
notice
to
the
state
is
not
merely
as
essential
as
notice
to
the
defendant
as
to
when
the
demand
must
be
made.
in
this
case,
petitioner
willie
mae
barker
had
no
idea
as
to
when
the
demand
must
be
made.
he
made
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
february
12,
1962.
he
filed
another
motion
to
dismiss
prior
to
trial.
because
it
was
denial
of
a
right
to
a
speedy
trial
but
both
cases
--
mr.
james
e.
milliman
this
is
correct
your
honor
and
this
raises
another
problem,
the
sixth
circuit
held
that
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
equated
with
the
demand.
the
solicitor
general's
brief
on
other
course
have
held
that
a
motion
to
dismiss
is
not
a
demand.
what
is
a
demand?
there
are
no
standards,
there
no
guidelines.
there
are
in
florida
now
three
times.
and
you
either
try
--
mr.
james
e.
milliman
please.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
this
is
correct.
but
petitioner
had
none
of
these
guidelines
to
guide
him
in
this
choice.
petitioner
responded
to
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky.
he
submitted
in
their
brief
that
any
demand
would
have
been
superfluous
that
it
wouldn't
have
been
granted.
that
was
a
useless
act
to
require
him
to
demand
trial
and
that
requiring
asking
him
to
bring
about
his
own
prosecution
to
prove
his
innocence.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
in
this
particular
case
--
mr.
james
e.
milliman
this
is
correct,
your
honor.
now
this
brings
us
to
second
issue,
the
issue
of
prejudice.
looking
at
the
bare
record
in
this
case,
there
is
no
specific
example
of
prejudice
except
for
the
testimony
of
one
witness
martha
barber,
sister-in-law
of
the
accomplice,
silas
manning
who
could
not
recall
certain
specific
events
but
otherwise
testified
with
certainty.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
actual
prejudice
informed.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
yes
your
honor,
in
the
form
of
lost
witnesses,
faded
memories.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
the
speedy
trial
provision
as
this
court
has
held
in
each
speedy
trial
case
brought
before
it
pretrial
anxiety,
hostility
in
the
community,
lost
of
jobs,
curtailment
of
associations,
there's
even
more
be
specific
pretrial
prejudice
here.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
simply
because
that
he
has
the
right
under
the
sixth
amendment
to
be
brought
quickly
to
trial
whether
he
ask
for
it
or
not.
now,
it
may
be
that
if
he
affirmatively
does
not
want
trial,
he
will
make
the
motion
for
continuances.
as
everyone
knows
a
defense
lawyer
can
continue
a
trial
indefinitely
and
if
he
had
actually
wanted
or
was
afraid
of
being
brought
to
trial,
he
would
have
moved
for
continuances.
now
it's
true
that
the
reason
for
this
delay
was
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
desired
to
secure
the
testimony
of
the
accomplice,
silas
manning.
and
it's
true
that
if
silas
manning
were
never
convicted,
willie
mae
barker
would
have
never
been
convicted,
we
conceive
this.
commonwealth
admits
it.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
this
is
correct
your
honor,
so
what
the
commonwealth
is
doing
was
postponing
willie
mae
barker's
trial
until
they
convicted
silas
manning.
there
is
only
one
problem.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
this
is
correct
your
honor.
it
only
tipped
them
six
trials
to
convict
silas
manning.
and
so
there
is
prejudice
even
there
that
if
he
had
been
brought
speedily
to
trial,
of
course
the
testimony
of
silas
manning
would
not
have
been
available
to
convict
him
but
this
does
not
appear
in
the
black
and
white
record.
more
fundamentally,
petitioner
is
now
released
on
parole.
he
was
paroled
in
august
of
1971
after
serving
eight
years
of
a
life
sentence.
now,
had
he
been
brought
to
trial
in
1959
in
kentucky
the
normal
sentence
is
seven
or
eight
years
for
a
life
imprisonment.
had
he
been
brought
to
trial
in
1959,
it
is
very
reasonable
to
assume
that
he
would
have
been
released
four
or
five
years
ago
to
resume
his
right
for
place
in
society.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
it
is.
well,
had
he
been
brought
to
trial
without
the
testimony
of
silas
manning
your
honor,
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
has
admitted
specifically
in
its
response
to
the
motion
to
dismiss
on
october
9,
1963
that
they
cannot
convict
willie
mae
barker
without
the
testimony
of
silas
manning.
they
admitted
this.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
if
silas
manning
had
been
a
fugitive.
it
would
have
given
some
more
sufficient
reason
for
the
delay.
whether
it
would
have
justified
it
for
five
years
is
highly
debatable.
there
would
be
a
burden
on
the
prosecution
to
make
every
effort
to
bring
this
man
back.
but
is
certainly
would
be
more
sufficient
reason
than
in
the
present
case.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
yes,
your
honor.
it
was
available
at
all
times.
all
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
had
to
do
was
to
convict
him.
with
all
due
respects
to
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky,
the
only
reason
for
the
delay
here
was
their
incompetence
and
their
inability
to
convict
this
man.
the
errors
they
committed,
one
conviction
was
reversed
because
of
the
admission
of
illegally
seized
evidence
and
the
admission
of
an
involuntary
confession.
another
conviction
was
reversed
because
they
insist
about
in
trying
the
crime
and
the
venue
where
the
crime
was
committed
at
mid
pretrial
hostility.
they
made
these
motions,
they
tried
silas
manning.
they
committed
these
constitutional
errors
and
procedural
errors
and
an
attempt
to
convict
him
for
a
procedural
advantage,
for
strategically
advantage
but
cannot
succeed
because
the
court
of
appeals
would
not
affirm
the
convictions
obtained
under
these
grounds.
so
he
was
there,
all
they
have
to
do
is
convict
him
legitimately.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
no,
your
honor.
i
do
not.
i
think
his
failure
to
object
was
more
than
the
grounds
of
perhaps
a
procedural
error
in
the
sense
of
an
attorney
fails
to
object
to
a
hearsay
statement
or
a
leading
question
and
as
precluded
from
raising
that
--
mr.
james
e.
milliman
no,
your
honor
that
--
i
believe
that
is
most
substitute
unconstitutionally
in
a
constitutionally
defined
area.
and
that
is
why
i
say
that
his
failure
to
object
should
not
be
and
would
not
be
a
passive
waiver
of
any
kind.
he
did
follow
the
motion
to
dismiss.
he
did
make
his
motion
to
dismiss.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
he
did
absolutely
--
mr.
james
e.
milliman
please?
mr.
james
e.
milliman
he
filed
his
motion
to
dismiss
in
february
of
1962,
february
12.
then
as
the
appendix
shows
that
there
were
further
continuances
made
on
june
4,
1962.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
no
he
didn't
your
honor
and
then
on
february
11,
1963
the
commonwealth
made
the
motion
to
continue
and
over
the
objection
of
defendant,
he
objected
to
this
motion
and
then
he
objected
to
the
motion
i
believe
on
june
17,
1963,
they
continued
again
over
the
objection
of
the
defendant
to
the
--
mr.
james
e.
milliman
that
was
after
the
sheriff,
the
material
witness
was
ill,
the
man
who
had
arrested
the
petitioner,
yes.
and
the
sixth
circuit
held
that
this
was
a
sufficient
reason
for
delay
and
we
don't
deny
this.
we
concede
that
this
was
sufficient
for
the
delay
from
march
1963
to
october
but
it
does
not
explain
the
delay
prior
to
that.
but
the
question
again
your
honor
is
when
should
he
have
made
the
demand?
he
didn't
know.
counsel
wouldn't
know.
nobody
was
requiring
counsel
for
petitioner
to
speculate
and
guess
as
to
what
he
must
do?
what
procedures
he
must
take
to
protect
and
preserve
the
constitutional
right
of
the
accused
and
that
is
the
issue.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
please?
mr.
james
e.
milliman
no,
i'm
not
your
honor
and
i'm
glad
i
wasn't.
but
with
respect
to
the
prejudice
issue,
again
he
would
have
been
released.
there
is
no
question
he
had
pretrial
anxiety
and
that
we
do
not
know
as
to
what
influence
this
delay
had
on
the
witnesses.
we
cannot
tell
from
the
record
whether
their
memories
faded
even
though
the
record
doesn't
show
they
said
it.
we
don't
from
the
record
what
facts
were
distorted.
we
don't
know
from
the
record
what
the
attitude
in
the
community
was
at
that
time
whether
it
was
still
hostile
or
whether
it
had
come
calmed
considerably.
the
only
thing
we
can
do
to
protect
his
right
in
this
case
is
presume
is
to
acknowledge
that
there
was
such
a
possibility
of
prejudice
after
five
years.
everyone
knows
that
memories
are
going
to
fade,
that
facts
are
going
to
become
distorted.
to
protect
his
rights,
we
have
to
presume.
after
five
years
these
things
happen.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
mr.
manning
finding,
the
appendix
doesn't
show
--
the
transcript
of
record
your
honor
would
show
that
mr.
manning
was
convicted
in
march
of
1963
to
life
imprisonment
and
convicted
in
december
--
or
march
of
1962,
i'm
sorry,
for
life
imprisonment
and
december
of
1962
to
life
imprisonment
for
the
murder
of
the
other
party,
there
were
two
parties
killed.
and
he
served
lives
and
i
don't
know
if
he
is
still
in
jail
or
not.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
mr.
manning
was
tried
six
times,
your
honor.
the
first
trial
resulted
in
the
hang
jury.
the
second
trial,
he
received
the
death
penalty.
the
court
of
appeals
of
kentucky
reversed
it
because
of
the
admission
of
illegally
seized
evidence
and
the
admission
with
involuntary
confession.
i
believe.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
it
is
possible
that
the
memory
of
the
witness
is
indeed
kept
alive
and
it
is
possible
that
the
hostile
attitude
of
the
community
was
indeed
kept
alive
also.
this
was
a
vicious
crime
of
two
prompted
people
in
a
rural
community
and
it
is
very
possible
that
manning's
trials
kept
alive
the
hostility
of
the
community
to
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
we
don't
know
with
this.
i
am
speculating.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
yes,
your
honor
i
am.
for
the
simple
reason
here
we
have
one
indicted
murderer
tried
six
times.
the
commonwealth
attorney
of
kentucky
is
going
to
have
a
very
difficult
time
explaining
to
the
electorate
why
he
can't
convict
this
man
and
the
fact
that
this
man
is
not
being
convicted
is
going
to
stir
the
animosity
of
the
community.
in
fact,
petitioners
first
two
trials
were
committed
--
were
tried
at
the
scene
of
the
crime
at
the
county
of
the
crime.
his
third
trial,
he
requested
the
change
of
venue
because
of
hostility
which
the
court
refused.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
no,
i'm
talking
about
manning
now.
so
this
leads
me
to
believe
that
the
hostilities
increased
as
the
time
went
by
because
nothing
had
been
done
to
bring
this
two
people
to
trial
or
nothing
had
been
done
to
convict
them
and
we
have
to
understand
the
attitude
of
the
circumstances
at
the
time.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
he
went
on
parole
in
august
of
1971
your
honor
and
i
submit
to
you
that
the
attitudes
of
rural
kentucky
have
changed
greatly
from
1958
to
1970.
there's
a
possible
explanation
why
he
has
been
paroled
1970
and
why
there
was
hostility
in
early
1960's.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
this
was
christian
county
kentucky,
hopkinsville
county
sit
in
southern
kentucky.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
yes
it
is
and
we
won't
into
things
not
in
the
record
your
honor
but
thank
you.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
yes
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
express
my
opinion
on
the
reason
for
delay.
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
do
not
specifically
decide
this
question.
they
decided
simply
that
from
the
period
of
the
time
of
the
demand
which
they
found
to
be
february
12,
1963
to
the
time
of
trial
but
there
was
a
sufficient
reason.
we
do
not
specifically
urge
this
point
on
our
petition
for
certiorari
for
the
simple
reasons
of
the
court
of
appeals
do
not
really
decide
it.
and
that
this
court
could
conceivably,
if
they
wish
remand
to
the
sixth
circuit
of
appeals
for
further
findings
on
that
issue
if
they
would
strike
that
down
the
demand
rule
and
hold
the
petitioner
has
shown
or
is
not
required
to
show
prejudice.
it
could
remand
to
the
sixth
circuit
for
further
findings
as
to
the
reason
for
delay.
as
his
honor,
i
believe,
justice
blackmun
referred
to
the
u.s.
versus
marion
case.
we
would
like
to
accept
the
good
and
reject
the
bad.
the
marion
case
is
not
applicable
to
this
case
for
the
simple
reason
that
in
that
case
this
court
held
that
the
defendants
were
not
an
accused.
because
they
were
talking
about
a
pre-indictment
delay
and
that
the
sixth
amendment
applies
only
to
an
accused
and
one
does
not
become
accused
until
he
is
indicted
and
there
is
still
no
question
in
this
case
that
willie
mae
barker
fit
the
definition
of
an
accused.
the
marion
case
would
be
applicable
and
that
it
explained
that
the
statute
of
limitations
for
example
are
designed
to
guarantee
against
stale
claims
and
of
course
in
kentucky
and
most
states,
there
is
no
statute
limitations
for
murder.
so
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations
to
apply
in
this
case
and
it
did
point
out
again
that
reaffirmed
the
--
this
court's
position
of
the
prejudice
resulting
from
the
pretrial
delays,
the
anxiety,
the
hostility
and
so
forth.
so
in
that
respect,
it
is
most
applicable
to
this
case.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
again
your
honor,
i
would
refer
to
the
american
bar
association
project
for
minimum
standards
that
this
is
no
reason
for
delay
that
his
acquiescence
for
the
fact
that
he
may
desire
--
mr.
james
e.
milliman
your
honor
i
would
concede
that
willie
mae
barker
probably
--
i
don't
know
this
for
a
fact,
probably,
did
not
want
to
be
tried.
i
don't
think
any
man
wants
to
be
tried
and
i
don't
consider
this
a
liability
on
his
behalf.
i
don't
blame
him.
what
he
was
trying
to
do
is
once
he
found
manning
had
been
convicted
then
of
course
he
wanted
the
case
dismissed.
there
is
no
question
about
this.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
no,
your
honor.
i'm
sure
that
some
accused
people
do
but
even
to
someone
who
is
innocent,
there
is
always
a
specter
that
he
may
be
convicted,
even
though
innocent
and
the
fact
that
he
is
going
to
come
to
trial
is
going
to
cause
him
great
apprehension,
question
--
mr.
james
e.
milliman
i
don't
know
if
it
would
be
more
accused
or
not
your
honor.
guilty
man
made
well
be
resigned
to
his
faith.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
no,
your
honor.
i
am
not.
i
believe
--
mr.
james
e.
milliman
this
is
quite
possible.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
again
your
honor,
to
answer
this
question
any
affirmative
would
be
to
require
the
speculation
from
the
record
that
he
did
take
a
--
make
it
strategical
--
mr.
james
e.
milliman
this
is
true,
this
is
true.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
we
don't
know
whether
he
did
that,
he
exercised
that
choice
but
we
don't
know
if
he
did
that
for
a
strategical
purpose
or
not.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
well,
your
honor,
it's
possible
that
he
thought
that
they
had
other
grounds
to
convict
based
upon
the
testimony
of
the
sheriff.
now,
looking
at
the
scene
of
the
trial,
it's
quite
possible
that
he
thought,
hostility
prevailing
at
the
time
if
there
was
such
that
the
man
would
have
been
convicted
based
upon
the
testimony
of
the
sheriff.
we
don't
know
his
reasons
for
not
demanding
a
speedy
trial
but
we
do
know
that
it
would
have
been
superfluous.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
this
is
reasonable
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
it
almost
did
your
honor
except
for
one
thing
if
i
may
state
this.
it's
important
to
note
that
manning
was
convicted
to
the
first
murder
in
march
of
1962
but
they
still
didn't
bring
barker
to
trial.
they
tried
manning
again
in
december
of
1962.
there
is
no
reason
in
the
world
they
couldn't
have
brought
barker
to
trial
after
the
first
conviction
of
manning
but
they
refused.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
your
honor,
the
record
shows
that
willie
mae
barker
was
keeping
company
with
mr.
manning's
wife
at
the
time
and
whether
that
would
have
made
him
a
willing
witness
or
not
i
think
it
would
have
made
him
more
willing
than
otherwise.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
i
would
like
to
reserve
five
minutes
for
rebuttal,
if
i
may.
the
facts
to
this
case
are
--
mr.
james
e.
milliman
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
facts
to
this
case
are
as
follows.
the
petitioner
willie
mae
barker
was
indicted
in
september
of
1958
for
the
murder
of
orlena
denton,
a
vicious
heinous
crime
which
he
was
accused
of
bursting
into
her
bedroom
and
beat
her
to
death
with
a
tire
iron
with
an
accomplice
one
silas
manning
who
becomes
very
relevant.
his
case
was
originally
set
for
trial
in
october
of
1958.
however,
there
occurred
a
series
of
16
continuances
granted
the
prosecution
in
this
case.
willie
mae
barker
was
not
brought
to
trial
until
october
of
1963,
a
delay
in
excess
of
five
years.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
counsel
was
appointed
right
after
indictment,
your
honor.
he
was
represented
by
counsel
throughout
this
delay.
we
have
no
complaint
in
this
regard.
petitioner
--
mr.
james
e.
milliman
yes,
your
honor.
he
had
full
notice
to
these
motions
for
continuances.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
the
record
does
not
show
whether
he
was
present
your
honor
for
this
continuances.
there
was
no
objection
made
to
these
continuances
until
1962.
at
which
point
counsel
started
objecting
to
this
continuances.
but
barker
was
released
on
bail.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
i
believe
there
were
four
or
five,
your
honor.
they
began
--
the
first
motion
to
dismiss
in
this
case
was
filed
on
february
12,
1962
and
this
is
on
page
9
of
the
appendix
and
thereafter
the
counsel
for
willie
mae
barker
at
that
time
objected
to
further
continuances.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
yes,
your
honor.
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
and
both
in
the
sixth
circuit
held
it
was
1963
that
this
motion
was
made
february
12,
1963
but
the
--
and
where
they
found
this
date
i
have
no
knowledge,
the
record
clearly
shows
it
was
made
on
february
12,
1962.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
yes
your
honor
but
the
district
court,
it's
ironic
to
district
court
on
page
22
of
the
appendix
pointed
out
that
the
motion
was
made
in
february
26,
1962
then
talked
about
the
resulting
eight
months
delay
but
the
delay
was
a
resulting
19
months
delay.
so
there
is
confusion
as
to
this
date.
the
petitioner
was
released
on
$5,000.00
bond
in
june
of
1959
and
remained
free
on
$5,000.00
bond
until
he
was
finally
convicted.
petitioner
then
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
kentucky
alleging
he
was
denied
as
right
to
a
speedy
trial
and
other
errors
in
the
trial
court.
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
conviction
then
later
petitioner
filed
this
habeas
corpus
proceeding
in
the
district
court,
the
western
district
of
kentucky
which
denied
relief.
he
appealed
to
this
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
which
affirmed
the
district
court
decision
and
this
court
granted
certiorari
january
18th
of
this
year.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
decided
this
case
on
two
grounds.
they
held
that
petitioner
had
waived
his
right
to
a
speedy
trial
by
failing
to
demand
trial.
that
the
demand
rule
states
that
the
right
to
a
speedy
trial
is
guaranteed
by
the
sixth
amendment
is
a
personal
right
which
may
be
weighed.
so
the
sixth
circuit
computed
only
the
time
after
the
first
motion
to
dismiss
was
made
in
computing
the
length
of
the
delay
which
had
found
to
be
nine
months
using
the
1963
date.
it
also
held
that
petitioner
had
not
shown
that
he
was
prejudice
by
the
delay.
petitioner's
therefore
raised
two
points
on
this
appeal.
first
that
the
demand
rule
is
inconsistent
with
constitutional
safeguards
and
should
not
be
required
and
the
second
issue
is
where
there
is
a
five
year
delay,
prejudice
should
be
presumed
as
inherent
in
the
delay
and
it's
important
to
emphasize
in
this
case
the
two
amicus
briefs
have
been
filed.
we
are
concerned
in
this
case
with
a
five-year
delay.
we
are
not
concerned
with
a
one
year
delay
or
two-year
delay.
this
case
presents
a
five-year
delay.
the
demand
rule
is
applied
in
this
case,
is
subject
to
attack
on
two
grounds.
this
court
has
consistently
held
that
any
waiver
of
a
constitutional
right
must
be
voluntary
and
intelligent
knowing
and
that
it
will
not
accept
a
passive
waiver
--
mr.
james
e.
milliman
this
is
correct
your
honor.
and
--
mr.
james
e.
milliman
your
honor
in
the
present
case,
it
is
contended
that
the
demand
rule
as
such
chills
his
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
we
had
a
man
here
who
was
indicted
for
willful
murder.
now
his
accomplice
had
twice
received
the
death
penalty.
this
put
him
in
the
position
of
--
if
he
has
to
demand
trial
to
protect
his
right
to
a
speedy
trial,
he
has
possibly
asking
himself,
asking
the
prosecution
to
give
him
the
electric
chair.
the
result
if
he
is
successful
is
death,
this
is
a
grisly
choice
which
this
court
condemned
in
faye
versus
noia,
where
--
mr.
james
e.
milliman
your
honor,
your
question
if
i
understand
it,
supposed
you
said
the
right
is
a
personal
right
which
can
be
waived.
now,
we
are
contending
that
to
ask
him
to
demand
trial
on
the
face
of
the
death
sentence
is
putting
him
in
the
same
position
that
the
defendant
was
in,
in
faye
versus
noia.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
it
may
well
be
that
trial
is
the
last
thing
he
wants
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
no
we
are
not
arguing
this.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
well,
this
is
correct
and
i
think
this
would
be
desired
by
any
defendant.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
this
is
what
we're
contending,
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
then
we
would
have
an
entirely
different
situation.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
in
this
case,
the
defendant
did
not
in
any
way
contribute
to
the
delay.
he
had
made
no
continuance
himself,
he
made
no
dilatory
motions.
he
merely
--
mr.
james
e.
milliman
in
that
event
your
honor,
he
would
have
affirmatively
contributed
to
the
delay.
he
would
have
brought
it
about
by
his
own
affirmative
actions
by
merely
sitting
back
and
doing
nothing.
he
did
nothing
to
contribute
to
the
delay.
now
he
did
file
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
february
12,
1962.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
your
honor,
in
that
event
i
would
think
there
would
be
less,
far
less
of
a
constitutional
objection,
in
that
case
we
would
still
have
this
grisly
choice.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
i
would
contend
in
that
event
that
it
would
still
be
unconstitutional
but
for
less
sufficient
reason
because
there
is
another
impelling
reason
in
this
case.
when
must
the
demand
be
made?
the
demand
or
rule
or
set
of
standard,
it
says
a
petitioner,
a
defendant
must
demand
trial.
but
when
must
he
make
that
demand,
there
are
no
guidelines,
there
are
no
standards.
florida
has
past
a
statute
that
says
after
three
successive
demands
--
mr.
james
e.
milliman
this
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
your
honor,
there
are
system
of
jurisprudence
and
burden
of
prosecution
is
on
the
state.
to
require
this
man,
willie
mae
barker
to
demand
trial
is
imposing
the
burden
upon
him
to
bring
about
trial
to
prove
his
innocence.
this
is
contrary
to
establish
principles
in
this
country.
he
should
not
have
the
burden
of
bringing
to
that
trial.
this
is
the
burden
of
the
prosecution.
it
is
there
duty,
the
american
bar
association
has
disapproved
that
the
"demand
rule"
for
this
reason
that
the
burden
is
on
the
prosecution
to
bring
trial
not
on
the
defendant.
but
when
does
the
defendant
demand
trial?
must
he
demand
trial
at
the
indictment
after
a
year
at
every
term
of
court?
any
waiver
of
a
constitutional
right
must
be
made
intelligently.
now,
petitioner
was
represented
by
counsel.
but
i
submit
that
even
though
he
is
represented
by
counsel,
his
counsel
couldn't
determine
when
the
demand
must
be
made.
what
if
it
would
have
been
made
at
the
indictment
and
no
other
demand
had
been
made.
what
if
it's
done
in
many
cases?
in
other
words,
what
the
demand
rule
is,
it's
treating
the
constitutional
right
as
a
procedural
nicety
which
can
be
waive
like
they
knew
if
you
fail
to
demand
it.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
well,
your
honor
we
submit
that
the
burden
--
since
the
burden
is
on
the
state
to
bring
about
trial
but
notice
to
the
state
is
not
merely
as
essential
as
notice
to
the
defendant
as
to
when
the
demand
must
be
made.
in
this
case,
petitioner
willie
mae
barker
had
no
idea
as
to
when
the
demand
must
be
made.
he
made
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
february
12,
1962.
he
filed
another
motion
to
dismiss
prior
to
trial.
because
it
was
denial
of
a
right
to
a
speedy
trial
but
both
cases
--
mr.
james
e.
milliman
this
is
correct
your
honor
and
this
raises
another
problem,
the
sixth
circuit
held
that
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
equated
with
the
demand.
the
solicitor
general's
brief
on
other
course
have
held
that
a
motion
to
dismiss
is
not
a
demand.
what
is
a
demand?
there
are
no
standards,
there
no
guidelines.
there
are
in
florida
now
three
times.
and
you
either
try
--
mr.
james
e.
milliman
please.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
this
is
correct.
but
petitioner
had
none
of
these
guidelines
to
guide
him
in
this
choice.
petitioner
responded
to
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky.
he
submitted
in
their
brief
that
any
demand
would
have
been
superfluous
that
it
wouldn't
have
been
granted.
that
was
a
useless
act
to
require
him
to
demand
trial
and
that
requiring
asking
him
to
bring
about
his
own
prosecution
to
prove
his
innocence.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
in
this
particular
case
--
mr.
james
e.
milliman
this
is
correct,
your
honor.
now
this
brings
us
to
second
issue,
the
issue
of
prejudice.
looking
at
the
bare
record
in
this
case,
there
is
no
specific
example
of
prejudice
except
for
the
testimony
of
one
witness
martha
barber,
sister-in-law
of
the
accomplice,
silas
manning
who
could
not
recall
certain
specific
events
but
otherwise
testified
with
certainty.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
actual
prejudice
informed.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
yes
your
honor,
in
the
form
of
lost
witnesses,
faded
memories.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
the
speedy
trial
provision
as
this
court
has
held
in
each
speedy
trial
case
brought
before
it
pretrial
anxiety,
hostility
in
the
community,
lost
of
jobs,
curtailment
of
associations,
there's
even
more
be
specific
pretrial
prejudice
here.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
simply
because
that
he
has
the
right
under
the
sixth
amendment
to
be
brought
quickly
to
trial
whether
he
ask
for
it
or
not.
now,
it
may
be
that
if
he
affirmatively
does
not
want
trial,
he
will
make
the
motion
for
continuances.
as
everyone
knows
a
defense
lawyer
can
continue
a
trial
indefinitely
and
if
he
had
actually
wanted
or
was
afraid
of
being
brought
to
trial,
he
would
have
moved
for
continuances.
now
it's
true
that
the
reason
for
this
delay
was
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
desired
to
secure
the
testimony
of
the
accomplice,
silas
manning.
and
it's
true
that
if
silas
manning
were
never
convicted,
willie
mae
barker
would
have
never
been
convicted,
we
conceive
this.
commonwealth
admits
it.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
this
is
correct
your
honor,
so
what
the
commonwealth
is
doing
was
postponing
willie
mae
barker's
trial
until
they
convicted
silas
manning.
there
is
only
one
problem.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
this
is
correct
your
honor.
it
only
tipped
them
six
trials
to
convict
silas
manning.
and
so
there
is
prejudice
even
there
that
if
he
had
been
brought
speedily
to
trial,
of
course
the
testimony
of
silas
manning
would
not
have
been
available
to
convict
him
but
this
does
not
appear
in
the
black
and
white
record.
more
fundamentally,
petitioner
is
now
released
on
parole.
he
was
paroled
in
august
of
1971
after
serving
eight
years
of
a
life
sentence.
now,
had
he
been
brought
to
trial
in
1959
in
kentucky
the
normal
sentence
is
seven
or
eight
years
for
a
life
imprisonment.
had
he
been
brought
to
trial
in
1959,
it
is
very
reasonable
to
assume
that
he
would
have
been
released
four
or
five
years
ago
to
resume
his
right
for
place
in
society.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
it
is.
well,
had
he
been
brought
to
trial
without
the
testimony
of
silas
manning
your
honor,
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
has
admitted
specifically
in
its
response
to
the
motion
to
dismiss
on
october
9,
1963
that
they
cannot
convict
willie
mae
barker
without
the
testimony
of
silas
manning.
they
admitted
this.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
if
silas
manning
had
been
a
fugitive.
it
would
have
given
some
more
sufficient
reason
for
the
delay.
whether
it
would
have
justified
it
for
five
years
is
highly
debatable.
there
would
be
a
burden
on
the
prosecution
to
make
every
effort
to
bring
this
man
back.
but
is
certainly
would
be
more
sufficient
reason
than
in
the
present
case.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
yes,
your
honor.
it
was
available
at
all
times.
all
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
had
to
do
was
to
convict
him.
with
all
due
respects
to
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky,
the
only
reason
for
the
delay
here
was
their
incompetence
and
their
inability
to
convict
this
man.
the
errors
they
committed,
one
conviction
was
reversed
because
of
the
admission
of
illegally
seized
evidence
and
the
admission
of
an
involuntary
confession.
another
conviction
was
reversed
because
they
insist
about
in
trying
the
crime
and
the
venue
where
the
crime
was
committed
at
mid
pretrial
hostility.
they
made
these
motions,
they
tried
silas
manning.
they
committed
these
constitutional
errors
and
procedural
errors
and
an
attempt
to
convict
him
for
a
procedural
advantage,
for
strategically
advantage
but
cannot
succeed
because
the
court
of
appeals
would
not
affirm
the
convictions
obtained
under
these
grounds.
so
he
was
there,
all
they
have
to
do
is
convict
him
legitimately.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
no,
your
honor.
i
do
not.
i
think
his
failure
to
object
was
more
than
the
grounds
of
perhaps
a
procedural
error
in
the
sense
of
an
attorney
fails
to
object
to
a
hearsay
statement
or
a
leading
question
and
as
precluded
from
raising
that
--
mr.
james
e.
milliman
no,
your
honor
that
--
i
believe
that
is
most
substitute
unconstitutionally
in
a
constitutionally
defined
area.
and
that
is
why
i
say
that
his
failure
to
object
should
not
be
and
would
not
be
a
passive
waiver
of
any
kind.
he
did
follow
the
motion
to
dismiss.
he
did
make
his
motion
to
dismiss.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
he
did
absolutely
--
mr.
james
e.
milliman
please?
mr.
james
e.
milliman
he
filed
his
motion
to
dismiss
in
february
of
1962,
february
12.
then
as
the
appendix
shows
that
there
were
further
continuances
made
on
june
4,
1962.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
no
he
didn't
your
honor
and
then
on
february
11,
1963
the
commonwealth
made
the
motion
to
continue
and
over
the
objection
of
defendant,
he
objected
to
this
motion
and
then
he
objected
to
the
motion
i
believe
on
june
17,
1963,
they
continued
again
over
the
objection
of
the
defendant
to
the
--
mr.
james
e.
milliman
that
was
after
the
sheriff,
the
material
witness
was
ill,
the
man
who
had
arrested
the
petitioner,
yes.
and
the
sixth
circuit
held
that
this
was
a
sufficient
reason
for
delay
and
we
don't
deny
this.
we
concede
that
this
was
sufficient
for
the
delay
from
march
1963
to
october
but
it
does
not
explain
the
delay
prior
to
that.
but
the
question
again
your
honor
is
when
should
he
have
made
the
demand?
he
didn't
know.
counsel
wouldn't
know.
nobody
was
requiring
counsel
for
petitioner
to
speculate
and
guess
as
to
what
he
must
do?
what
procedures
he
must
take
to
protect
and
preserve
the
constitutional
right
of
the
accused
and
that
is
the
issue.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
please?
mr.
james
e.
milliman
no,
i'm
not
your
honor
and
i'm
glad
i
wasn't.
but
with
respect
to
the
prejudice
issue,
again
he
would
have
been
released.
there
is
no
question
he
had
pretrial
anxiety
and
that
we
do
not
know
as
to
what
influence
this
delay
had
on
the
witnesses.
we
cannot
tell
from
the
record
whether
their
memories
faded
even
though
the
record
doesn't
show
they
said
it.
we
don't
from
the
record
what
facts
were
distorted.
we
don't
know
from
the
record
what
the
attitude
in
the
community
was
at
that
time
whether
it
was
still
hostile
or
whether
it
had
come
calmed
considerably.
the
only
thing
we
can
do
to
protect
his
right
in
this
case
is
presume
is
to
acknowledge
that
there
was
such
a
possibility
of
prejudice
after
five
years.
everyone
knows
that
memories
are
going
to
fade,
that
facts
are
going
to
become
distorted.
to
protect
his
rights,
we
have
to
presume.
after
five
years
these
things
happen.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
mr.
manning
finding,
the
appendix
doesn't
show
--
the
transcript
of
record
your
honor
would
show
that
mr.
manning
was
convicted
in
march
of
1963
to
life
imprisonment
and
convicted
in
december
--
or
march
of
1962,
i'm
sorry,
for
life
imprisonment
and
december
of
1962
to
life
imprisonment
for
the
murder
of
the
other
party,
there
were
two
parties
killed.
and
he
served
lives
and
i
don't
know
if
he
is
still
in
jail
or
not.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
mr.
manning
was
tried
six
times,
your
honor.
the
first
trial
resulted
in
the
hang
jury.
the
second
trial,
he
received
the
death
penalty.
the
court
of
appeals
of
kentucky
reversed
it
because
of
the
admission
of
illegally
seized
evidence
and
the
admission
with
involuntary
confession.
i
believe.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
it
is
possible
that
the
memory
of
the
witness
is
indeed
kept
alive
and
it
is
possible
that
the
hostile
attitude
of
the
community
was
indeed
kept
alive
also.
this
was
a
vicious
crime
of
two
prompted
people
in
a
rural
community
and
it
is
very
possible
that
manning's
trials
kept
alive
the
hostility
of
the
community
to
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
we
don't
know
with
this.
i
am
speculating.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
yes,
your
honor
i
am.
for
the
simple
reason
here
we
have
one
indicted
murderer
tried
six
times.
the
commonwealth
attorney
of
kentucky
is
going
to
have
a
very
difficult
time
explaining
to
the
electorate
why
he
can't
convict
this
man
and
the
fact
that
this
man
is
not
being
convicted
is
going
to
stir
the
animosity
of
the
community.
in
fact,
petitioners
first
two
trials
were
committed
--
were
tried
at
the
scene
of
the
crime
at
the
county
of
the
crime.
his
third
trial,
he
requested
the
change
of
venue
because
of
hostility
which
the
court
refused.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
no,
i'm
talking
about
manning
now.
so
this
leads
me
to
believe
that
the
hostilities
increased
as
the
time
went
by
because
nothing
had
been
done
to
bring
this
two
people
to
trial
or
nothing
had
been
done
to
convict
them
and
we
have
to
understand
the
attitude
of
the
circumstances
at
the
time.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
he
went
on
parole
in
august
of
1971
your
honor
and
i
submit
to
you
that
the
attitudes
of
rural
kentucky
have
changed
greatly
from
1958
to
1970.
there's
a
possible
explanation
why
he
has
been
paroled
1970
and
why
there
was
hostility
in
early
1960's.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
this
was
christian
county
kentucky,
hopkinsville
county
sit
in
southern
kentucky.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
yes
it
is
and
we
won't
into
things
not
in
the
record
your
honor
but
thank
you.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
yes
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
express
my
opinion
on
the
reason
for
delay.
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
do
not
specifically
decide
this
question.
they
decided
simply
that
from
the
period
of
the
time
of
the
demand
which
they
found
to
be
february
12,
1963
to
the
time
of
trial
but
there
was
a
sufficient
reason.
we
do
not
specifically
urge
this
point
on
our
petition
for
certiorari
for
the
simple
reasons
of
the
court
of
appeals
do
not
really
decide
it.
and
that
this
court
could
conceivably,
if
they
wish
remand
to
the
sixth
circuit
of
appeals
for
further
findings
on
that
issue
if
they
would
strike
that
down
the
demand
rule
and
hold
the
petitioner
has
shown
or
is
not
required
to
show
prejudice.
it
could
remand
to
the
sixth
circuit
for
further
findings
as
to
the
reason
for
delay.
as
his
honor,
i
believe,
justice
blackmun
referred
to
the
u.s.
versus
marion
case.
we
would
like
to
accept
the
good
and
reject
the
bad.
the
marion
case
is
not
applicable
to
this
case
for
the
simple
reason
that
in
that
case
this
court
held
that
the
defendants
were
not
an
accused.
because
they
were
talking
about
a
pre-indictment
delay
and
that
the
sixth
amendment
applies
only
to
an
accused
and
one
does
not
become
accused
until
he
is
indicted
and
there
is
still
no
question
in
this
case
that
willie
mae
barker
fit
the
definition
of
an
accused.
the
marion
case
would
be
applicable
and
that
it
explained
that
the
statute
of
limitations
for
example
are
designed
to
guarantee
against
stale
claims
and
of
course
in
kentucky
and
most
states,
there
is
no
statute
limitations
for
murder.
so
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations
to
apply
in
this
case
and
it
did
point
out
again
that
reaffirmed
the
--
this
court's
position
of
the
prejudice
resulting
from
the
pretrial
delays,
the
anxiety,
the
hostility
and
so
forth.
so
in
that
respect,
it
is
most
applicable
to
this
case.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
again
your
honor,
i
would
refer
to
the
american
bar
association
project
for
minimum
standards
that
this
is
no
reason
for
delay
that
his
acquiescence
for
the
fact
that
he
may
desire
--
mr.
james
e.
milliman
your
honor
i
would
concede
that
willie
mae
barker
probably
--
i
don't
know
this
for
a
fact,
probably,
did
not
want
to
be
tried.
i
don't
think
any
man
wants
to
be
tried
and
i
don't
consider
this
a
liability
on
his
behalf.
i
don't
blame
him.
what
he
was
trying
to
do
is
once
he
found
manning
had
been
convicted
then
of
course
he
wanted
the
case
dismissed.
there
is
no
question
about
this.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
no,
your
honor.
i'm
sure
that
some
accused
people
do
but
even
to
someone
who
is
innocent,
there
is
always
a
specter
that
he
may
be
convicted,
even
though
innocent
and
the
fact
that
he
is
going
to
come
to
trial
is
going
to
cause
him
great
apprehension,
question
--
mr.
james
e.
milliman
i
don't
know
if
it
would
be
more
accused
or
not
your
honor.
guilty
man
made
well
be
resigned
to
his
faith.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
no,
your
honor.
i
am
not.
i
believe
--
mr.
james
e.
milliman
this
is
quite
possible.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
again
your
honor,
to
answer
this
question
any
affirmative
would
be
to
require
the
speculation
from
the
record
that
he
did
take
a
--
make
it
strategical
--
mr.
james
e.
milliman
this
is
true,
this
is
true.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
we
don't
know
whether
he
did
that,
he
exercised
that
choice
but
we
don't
know
if
he
did
that
for
a
strategical
purpose
or
not.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
well,
your
honor,
it's
possible
that
he
thought
that
they
had
other
grounds
to
convict
based
upon
the
testimony
of
the
sheriff.
now,
looking
at
the
scene
of
the
trial,
it's
quite
possible
that
he
thought,
hostility
prevailing
at
the
time
if
there
was
such
that
the
man
would
have
been
convicted
based
upon
the
testimony
of
the
sheriff.
we
don't
know
his
reasons
for
not
demanding
a
speedy
trial
but
we
do
know
that
it
would
have
been
superfluous.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
this
is
reasonable
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
it
almost
did
your
honor
except
for
one
thing
if
i
may
state
this.
it's
important
to
note
that
manning
was
convicted
to
the
first
murder
in
march
of
1962
but
they
still
didn't
bring
barker
to
trial.
they
tried
manning
again
in
december
of
1962.
there
is
no
reason
in
the
world
they
couldn't
have
brought
barker
to
trial
after
the
first
conviction
of
manning
but
they
refused.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
your
honor,
the
record
shows
that
willie
mae
barker
was
keeping
company
with
mr.
manning's
wife
at
the
time
and
whether
that
would
have
made
him
a
willing
witness
or
not
i
think
it
would
have
made
him
more
willing
than
otherwise.
mr.
james
e.
milliman
thank
you,
your
honor.
