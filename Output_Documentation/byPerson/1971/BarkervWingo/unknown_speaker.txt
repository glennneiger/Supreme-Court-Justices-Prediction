unknown
speaker
did
the
counsel
receive
notice
of
the
motions
for
continuance?
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
show
whether
or
not
he
was
present.
whether
motion
--
unknown
speaker
how
many
of
continuances
were
granted
over
the
objection
of
your
client?
unknown
speaker
there
is
some
confusion
as
to
whether
or
not
it
was
62
or
63.
unknown
speaker
and
the
federal
government's
amicus
brief,
it's
in
to
a
little
bit
to
but
--
unknown
speaker
that
assumes
you
answer,
doesn't
it?
that
assumes
that
the
right
to
a
speedy
trial
exists
without
the
demand.
unknown
speaker
well
then,
how
about
the
demand?
why
should
he
let
--
why
shouldn't
they
have
to
demand
that
in
order
to
trigger
the
right
--
unknown
speaker
you're
saying
that
he
can't
be
required
to
come
in
and
ask
for
what
he
will
later
contend,
he
should
have
been
given
automatically.
i
don't
see
that
there's
any
chilling
or
burden
there
when
you're
dealing
exactly
with
the
thing
that
you're
requesting.
unknown
speaker
but
nonetheless,
he
can
come
in
and
if
he
has
been
tried
in
a
particular
time
even
though
he
hasn't
request
and
say
now
you
got
to
dismiss
the
whole
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
well
do
you
say
that
have
it
be
unconstitutional
at
the
state
had
a
rule,
a
court
rule
that
says
that
continuances
by
the
state
and
delay
must
be
on
notice
to
the
defendant
and
that
unless
and
that
---the
defendant
wants
a
trial,
he
isn't
going
to
be
responsible
for
the
delay
he
must
object.
unknown
speaker
well,
so
you
still
claim
it
would
be
unconstitutional
if
the
state
said,
look,
we
are
going
to
give
you
an
early
trial
or
a
late
trial,
now
which
one
do
you
want?
and
he
said
i
want
the
late
trial.
unknown
speaker
well,
here
at
least
for
three
or
four
years
the
continuances
were
unnoticed
to
him
and
he
never
objected
to
this.
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
that
you
are
--
you
say
the
state
nevertheless
should
be
charged
with
that
delay?
unknown
speaker
we
are
treating
it
as
something
basically
like
a
statute
of
limitations
and
it
runs
without
regard
to
the
defendants
and
a
civil
case
giving
notice
to
hear
that
said
that
he
is
invoking
the
statute
limitations.
it
simply
comes
in
after
its
run
and
said
--
unknown
speaker
the
problem
as
i
see
it
with
your
position
is
that
there
isn't
any
fix
time
that
you're
talking
about.
the
way
there
is
with
a
statute
of
limitations
at
least
the
state
has
noticed
that
if
they
don't
for
constitutional
purposes
try
with
uncertain
person
and
period
and
then
they're
through.
unknown
speaker
but
he
never
did
--
he
never
did
ask
for
a
speedy
trial.
he
asked
that
the
indictment
be
dismissed.
right?
unknown
speaker
ant
there
are
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
i
think?
unknown
speaker
aren't
there
are
also
in
new
york
state
and
in
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals,
at
least
respectively?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
in
this
particular
case?
unknown
speaker
that
the
key
witness
would
have
pleaded
his
compulsory
self
incrimination
[voice
overlap].
unknown
speaker
what
kind
of
prejudice
are
you
talking
about?
is
it
at
the
trial?
unknown
speaker
at
the
trial,
at
the
trial?
unknown
speaker
but
what
about
the
--
what
about
other
prejudice
of
the
speedy
trial
provision
as
oppose
to
in
fact
the
end?
unknown
speaker
or
if
you
had
gone
on
trial
before
he
did,
you
would
defend
it?
unknown
speaker
until
they
got
the
evidence
to
convict?
unknown
speaker
i
say
that
it's
even
more
reasonable
unless
he
might
have
been
acquitted
--
unknown
speaker
mr.
milliman,
you
say
in
your
brief
that
they
cannot
be
a
passive
waiver
of
a
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
do
you
consider
that
the
failure
of
counsel
to
object
to
these
16
continuances
was
a
passive
waiver?
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
that
a
continuance
particularly
one
granted
16
times,
if
procedural
so
far
as
the
right
to
a
speedy
trial?
unknown
speaker
he
made
that
in
1962,
what
did
he
do
between
march
of
1962
and
march
of
1963?
unknown
speaker
as
counsel
for
the
petition?
unknown
speaker
counsel
for
the
petition?
unknown
speaker
did
he
object
to
that?
unknown
speaker
that's
when
the
witness
was
ill,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
and
you
weren't
the
counsel
on
that?
unknown
speaker
you
weren't
the
counsel?
unknown
speaker
and
how
many
other
trials
were
there
mr.
milliman?
unknown
speaker
but
i
suppose
one
can
argue
that
with
all
these
trials,
the
memory
of
witnesses
is
indeed
kept
alive.
unknown
speaker
you're
not
suggesting
that
the
community
of
it,
it
would
be
more
hostile
in
1963
than
it
would
have
been
in
1958?
unknown
speaker
barker
had
three
times?
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
site
of
hopkinsville?
unknown
speaker
it's
pretty
good
size
town.
unknown
speaker
did
manning
--
manning
didn't
testify
--
i
mean
the
petitioner
didn't
testify
at
manning's
trial,
did
he?
unknown
speaker
you,
the
state,
the
commonwealth
had
other
evidence
against
manning.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
you're
telling
us
that
the
petitioner
could
not
have
been
convicted
without
confederate
manning's
testimony?
unknown
speaker
or
apparently
manning
could
be
--
was
convicted
without
his
confederates.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
clearly
shows
why
the
commonwealth
chose
to
try
manning
first.
you
said
you
didn't
know,
it's
very
clear
why
they
did
it,
isn't?
unknown
speaker
unless
they
convicted
manning,
they
couldn't
have
convicted
either
of
them?
unknown
speaker
and
initially
they
were
relying
of
his
confessions,
manning's
confession?
unknown
speaker
the
manning
case.
that
was
one
of
--
was
not
that
one
of
the
reasons
for
reversal
in
one
trial?
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
so
they
did
have
a
confession
from
manning?
unknown
speaker
but
not
from
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
and
you
would
argue
this
if
barker
had
every
week
demanded
a
trial?
unknown
speaker
i
gather
you
--
your
submission
is
that
we
don't
have
to
deal
--
it's
not
actually
concession
i
take
it,
but
on
the
premise
that
the
speedy
trial
again
does
not
require
the
accused
to
make
a
demand.
assuming
that
premise,
you
say
nevertheless
the
state
for
good
reason,
may
continue
to
trial
until
it's
ready
to
go
to
trial.
unknown
speaker
but
if
the
rule
where
you
have
to
make
a
demand,
we
don't
need
this
parole?
unknown
speaker
you
could
prevail
on
either
point
i
take
it,
if
the
court
were
to
adopt
the
line
of
reasoning
favorable
to
you?
unknown
speaker
you
could
prevail
i
suppose
still
on
the
third
round
with
or
without
demand,
with
or
without
good
cause
on
the
part
of
the
commonwealth
unless
the
constitutional
provision
is
not
violated
without
a
showing
of
prejudice.
unknown
speaker
this
was
not
a
felony
murder,
burglary
or
robbery?
unknown
speaker
so,
they
did
break
in
to
--
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
did
i
interrupt
you?
unknown
speaker
i
understood
you
to
say
that
there
were
one
or
more
kentucky
statutes
that
related
to
speedy
trial
and
in
each
instance
provided
that
just
cause
would
be
an
excuse
the
night
going
forward.
are
those
statutes
cited
in
the
briefs,
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
this
question,
in
kind
of
different
matter.
would
you
refresh
my
recollection
as
to
what
motions
were
made
after
the
petition
as
motion
to
dismiss
in
1962?
i
think
it
was
february
of
1962
and
the
date
of
the
trial?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
and
the
ground
for
all
of
those
was
unavailability
of
witnesses?
unknown
speaker
well
the
motion
was
the
denial
of
a
right
to
a
speedy
trial?
unknown
speaker
motion
to
dismiss?
unknown
speaker
and
then
the
prosecution
defended
against
the
motion
saying
that
our
witnesses
are
not
available,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
oh!
i
beg
your
pardon?
there
were
however,
how
many
motions
to
dismiss
on
behalf
of
the
defendant?
unknown
speaker
four.
beginning
in
1962?
unknown
speaker
mr.
willmott,
the
court
rendered
in
opinion
in
united
states
against
marion
last
december.
this
does
not
say
that
in
your
brief
or
in
the
other
brief
or
in
the
main
amicus
brief.
it
is
cited
in
the
government's
amicus
brief.
is
this
--
are
you
familiar
with
this
case?
unknown
speaker
what
i
want
to
ask
you
of
course
perhaps
you
can't
comment
on
it
is
whether
you
feel
that
has
any
pertinency
in
this
case.
i'll
ask
the
same
question
on
your
opponent
when
he
is
up
in
rebuttal.
unknown
speaker
under
all
circumstances?
unknown
speaker
mr.
willmott
is
the
kentucky
state
court
set
up
such
that
a
court
is
continuously
sitting
except
for
vacation
time
in
christian
county
or
does
it
just
sit
on
circuit
there
at
certain
times
of
the
year.
unknown
speaker
how
many
sessions
of
court
do
they
have
each
year
in
christian
county?
unknown
speaker
and
how
long
does
an
average
session
lasts?
approximately?
unknown
speaker
so
a
court
would
be
sitting
in
christian
in
maybe
six
months
out
of
the
12
of
each
year?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
are
making
any
claim
that
the
--
that
counsel
was
inadequate
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well
,
he
was
the
counsel
--
he
was
the
counsel
and
if
the
states
evidence
were
so
weak,
you
would
think
there
might
have
been
interest
in
an
early
trial.
unknown
speaker
mr.
counsel
turned
to
have
the
choice
of
either
objecting
or
not
objecting
--
unknown
speaker
and
he
exercised
that
choice
of
not
objecting?
unknown
speaker
to
the
extent
that
the
defense
counsels
consent
to
the
continuances
may
have
been
based
on
the
possibility
of
the
future
absence
of
a
witness
to
the
extent
that
the
sheriff
was
important
to
the
prosecution
of
this
case.
it
almost
paid
off,
i
take.
unknown
speaker
did
the
counsel
receive
notice
of
the
motions
for
continuance?
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
show
whether
or
not
he
was
present.
whether
motion
--
unknown
speaker
how
many
of
continuances
were
granted
over
the
objection
of
your
client?
unknown
speaker
there
is
some
confusion
as
to
whether
or
not
it
was
62
or
63.
unknown

and

he
asked
that
the

be

isn't?
unknown
speaker
unless
they
convicted
manning,
they
couldn't
have
convicted
either
of
them?
unknown
speaker
and
initially
they
were
relying
of
his
confessions,
manning's
confession?
unknown
speaker
the
manning
case.
that
was
one
of
--
was
not
that
one
of
the
reasons
for
reversal
in
one
trial?
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
so
they
did
have
a
confession
from
manning?
unknown
speaker
but
not
from
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
and
you
would
argue
this
if
barker
had
every
week
demanded
a
trial?
unknown
speaker
i
gather
you
--
your
submission
is
that
we
don't
have
to
deal
--
it's
not
actually
concession
i
take
it,
but
on
the
premise
that
the
speedy
trial
again
does
not
require
the
accused
to
make
a
demand.
assuming
that
premise,
you
say
nevertheless
the
state
for
good
reason,
may
continue
to
trial
until
it's
ready
to
go
to
trial.
unknown
speaker
but
if
the
rule
where
you
have
to
make
a
demand,
we
don't
need
this
parole?
unknown
speaker
you
could
prevail
on
either
point
i
take
it,
if
the
court
were
to
adopt
the
line
of
reasoning
favorable
to
you?
unknown
speaker
you
could
prevail
i
suppose
still
on
the
third
round
with
or
without
demand,
with
or
without
good
cause
on
the
part
of
the
commonwealth
unless
the
constitutional
provision
is
not
violated
without
a
showing
of
prejudice.
unknown
speaker
this
was
not
a
felony
murder,
burglary
or
robbery?
unknown
speaker
so,
they
did
break
in
to
--
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
did
i
interrupt
you?
unknown
speaker
i
understood
you
to
say
that
there
were
one
or
more
kentucky
statutes
that
related
to
speedy
trial
and
in
each
instance
provided
that
just
cause
would
be
an
excuse
the
night
going
forward.
are
those
statutes
cited
in
the
briefs,
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
this
question,
in
kind
of
different
matter.
would
you
refresh
my
recollection
as
to
what
motions
were
made
after
the
petition
as
motion
to
dismiss
in
1962?
i
think
it
was
february
of
1962
and
the
date
of
the
trial?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
and
the
ground
for
all
of
those
was
unavailability
of
witnesses?
unknown
speaker
well
the
motion
was
the
denial
of
a
right
to
a
speedy
trial?
unknown
speaker
motion
to
dismiss?
unknown
speaker
and
then
the
prosecution
defended
against
the
motion
saying
that
our
witnesses
are
not
available,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
oh!
i
beg
your
pardon?
there
were
however,
how
many
motions
to
dismiss
on
behalf
of
the
defendant?
unknown
speaker
four.
beginning
in
1962?
unknown
speaker
mr.
willmott,
the
court
rendered
in
opinion
in
united
states
against
marion
last
december.
this
does
not
say
that
in
your
brief
or
in
the
other
brief
or
in
the
main
amicus
brief.
it
is
cited
in
the
government's
amicus
brief.
is
this
--
are
you
familiar
with
this
case?
unknown
speaker
what
i
want
to
ask
you
of
course
perhaps
you
can't
comment
on
it
is
whether
you
feel
that
has
any
pertinency
in
this
case.
i'll
ask
the
same
question
on
your
opponent
when
he
is
up
in
rebuttal.
unknown
speaker
under
all
circumstances?
unknown
speaker
mr.
willmott
is
the
kentucky
state
court
set
up
such
that
a
court
is
continuously
sitting
except
for
vacation
time
in
christian
county
or
does
it
just
sit
on
circuit
there
at
certain
times
of
the
year.
unknown
speaker
how
many
sessions
of
court
do
they
have
each
year
in
christian
county?
unknown
speaker
and
how
long
does
an
average
session
lasts?
approximately?
unknown
speaker
so
a
court
would
be
sitting
in
christian
in
maybe
six
months
out
of
the
12
of
each
year?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
are
making
any
claim
that
the
--
that
counsel
was
inadequate
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well
,
he
was
the
counsel
--
he
was
the
counsel
and
if
the
states
evidence
were
so
weak,
you
would
think
there
might
have
been
interest
in
an
early
trial.
unknown
speaker
mr.
counsel
turned
to
have
the
choice
of
either
objecting
or
not
objecting
--
unknown
speaker
and
he
exercised
that
choice
of
not
objecting?
unknown
speaker
to
the
extent
that
the
defense
counsels
consent
to
the
continuances
may
have
been
based
on
the
possibility
of
the
future
absence
of
a
witness
to
the
extent
that
the
sheriff
was
important
to
the
prosecution
of
this
case.
it
almost
paid
off,
i
take.
