mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
not
in
dispute.
the
commonwealth
did
delay
the
trial
of
the
petitioner
for
five
years
and
i
think
a
little
more
thorough
explanation
of
why
it
delayed
it
as
an
order,
the
commonwealth
shows
to
prosecute
silas
manning
first.
now
this
decision
i
don't
know
why
it
was
made
but
the
commonwealth
attorney
did
make
it
and
they
had
not
by
my
brother
he
--
they
did
have
a
difficulty
in
obtaining
a
valid
conviction.
i
don't
think
it
can
be
blamed
on
any
incompetence
on
the
part
of
the
commonwealth
attorney.
and
after
in
december
of
1962
when
manning's
final
trial
was
held,
trial
was
set
for
the
next
term
to
court
to
february
term
of
the
1963
christian
county
circuit.
the
chief
collaborating
witness
was
the
sheriff
of
christian
county,
sheriff
mckinney.
he
became
seriously
ill
with
a
stomach
disorder,
he
was
later
admitted
to
the
hospital
and
portions
of
his
stomach
were
removed
and
he
later
underwent
a
gallbladder
operation.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
three,
1963.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
no.
it's
just
an
explanation
of
the
last
ten
months
or
so
of
the
delay.
the
first
four
years
of
the
delay
were
due
to
manning
being
unavailable
for
testimony.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
right.
and
the
commonwealth
submits
that
the
real
issue
in
this
case
is
not
when
the
demand
should
be
made
or
if
a
demand
should
be
made
but
narrowest
down
to
the
fact
made
the
commonwealth
delay
a
trial
for
any
reason
for
this
period
of
time.
now,
there
are
several
statutes
from
different
states
which
call
for
a
dismissal
of
the
indictment
similar
to
federal
rule
48
(b)
if
a
trial
was
not
held
within
so
many
days
or
so
many
months
or
so
many
terms
at
court.
but
every
--
every
rule
or
every
statute
also
states
in
the
final
line
unless
good
cause
be
shown
and
our
contention
is
that
the
commonwealth
had
good
cause
in
this
case.
the
--
it's
a
simple
fact
without
manning,
we
would
not
be
here
today
because
petitioner
would
not
have
been
convicted
and
without
the
sheriff,
the
collaborating
evidence
would
have
been
insufficient
to
support
the
testimony
of
an
accomplice.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
no,
sir.[voice

mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
yes
sir.
they
had
--
they
found
his
car
--
or
the
--
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
yes
sir.
the
--
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
well
manning
came
into
the
house
covered
with
blood
and
there
was
tangible
evidence
to
convict
manning
but
manning
was
the
--
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
well,
yes
sir.
i
believe
that
is
the
reason
that
they
felt
more
assured
of
securing
conviction
of
manning.
the
evidence
was
stronger
against
manning
than
it
was
against
barker.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
right.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
in
barker
case
or
the
manning
case?
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
believe
the
reasons
for
reversal
were
--
well
yes,
sir.
one
of
--
he
was
improperly
admitted
evidences
to
result
of
a
search
and
seizure
and
on
involuntary
confession,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
this
--
there
was
an
admission
made
by
barker
along
reliance
of
--
when
the
sheriff
came
to
arrest
him,
he
boarded
out
before
being
asked
or
told
anything.
if
you're
wondering
what
happened
to
those
old
folks,
manning
did
it.
and
that
was
--
excuse
me,
the
major
portion
of
the
sheriff's
testimony
was
his
admission.
now,
as
stated
the
reason
for
the
delay
in
this
case
is
legitimate
and
at
my
opinion,
the
interests
of
society
have
to
be
balanced
against
the
interest
of
the
accused
and
if
there
is
a
valid
reason.
if
there
can
be
any
valid
reason
for
postponement
of
a
trial
for
five
years,
this
case
presents
the
same.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
if
--
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
right
your
honor,
i
have
--
and
i
believe
the
demand
issue
is
secondary.
i
do
not
feel
that
the
accused
should
be
allowed
to
play
both
ends
against
submittal
and
sit
back
and
not
take
any
affirmative
action.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
i
don't
think
--
i
think
you
have
to
consider
both
of
them
in
a
case
such
as
this.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
right,
your
honor.
i
think
initially,
there's
very
little
guidance
on
what
constitutes
good
cause
for
the
government
delaying
the
trial.
there
are
ample
evidences
to
the
defendant
filing
dilatory
pleadings
or
shuffling
to
street
and
avoiding
trial,
being
a
fugitive,
being
incompetent.
these
do
not
violate
the
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
however,
there
is
fair
little
guidance
as
to
why
the
government
may
delay
a
trial.
the
most
decisions
have
followed
the
gleichman
(ph)
case
and
which
necessitates
a
demand
and
if
a
demand
does
not
made,
waiver
his
presumed.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
yes,
sir
that
is
meant.
there
--
the
only
prejudice
that
could
be
assumed
and
my
brother
points
out
in
his
brief
that
possible
prejudice
may
be
presumed
and
that
he
suffered
the
scorn
or
the
stigma
of
being
under
an
indictment
for
five
years
for
hearing
his
crime
such
as
murder.
there
is
no
actual
physical
tangible
prejudice
shown.
all
the
witnesses
testified,
they
were
also
witnesses
at
manning's
trial
and
by
the
petitioner's
trial
they
were
thoroughly
burst
in
their
testimony.
and
one
has
but
to
read
the
evidence
to
see
how
concrete
they
were
in
answering
their
questions.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
yes
your
honor
at
barker's
trial.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
yes
there
were
--
there
were
other
corroborating
evidence
but
it
was
not
what
one
would
consider
the
major
key
witness.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
well
the
sheriff
was
also
the
one
that
found
the
car
--
barker's
car
parking
from
the
house
next
door
and
he
had
some
other
investigative
facts
at
the
--
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
think
if
--
i
think
his
testimony
alone
would
have
been
enough
but
i
don't
think
that
some
of
the
other
testimony
would
have
been
enough
to
corroborate
manning's
testimony.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
they
initially
were
drinking
and
needed
some
money
and
they
had
heard
that
mr.
and
mrs.
denton
kept
large
sums
of
money.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
yes,
sir.
they
went
in
the
window
with
the
tire
and
proceeded.
i
think
they
hit
mrs.
denton
first
while
she
was
in
bed
but
the
--
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
no,
sir.
go
ahead.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
your
honor,
may
have
mislead
you,
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that
kentucky
has
some
statutes
there.
i
think
california
or
michigan
other
states
have
enacted.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
right
in
the
model,
the
model
penal
code
i
believe
contains
provision.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
there
were
three
others.
three
--
there
was
initial
in
february
of
1962,
there
is
one
in
the
summer
i
believe
in
july
of
1962.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
and
then
there
was
one
in
march
of
1963
in
the
summer
of
1963,
june
or
july
and
then
at
the
trial
just
before
trial
start.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
motion
dismissed
for
lack
of
--
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
--
prosecution
as
to
whether
they
--
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
yes,
sir.
but
the
motions
for
continuance
that
i
was
asking
--
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
four
motions.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
yes
sir,
february
of
1962
that
is
according
to
the
record.
i
don't
know
how
the
court,
the
district
court
and
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
got
confused
but
they
have
cited
and
in
it
is
the
first
demand
being
made
in
1963.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
your
honor,
i
picked
up
a
slip
this
morning,
when
i
became
aware
of
it,
we
did
not
have
the
advance
sheet
in
our
office
before
i
came
in
to
washington.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
well,
as
i
understand
marion
it
was
a
pre-indictment
delay
and
this
court
held
that
the
sixth
amendment
speedy
trial
clause
was
not
applicable
to
pre-indictment
delays.
now
that
the
concurring
opinion
--
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
that
was
my
opinion
that
it
did
not
-
it
was
not
applicable
to
the
pre-indictment
stage
because
a
person
had
not
become
an
accused.
back
in
the
prejudice
argument,
we
stated
that
there
were
no
lost
witnesses
that
the
witnesses
memory
was
--
there
was
no
mnemonic
loss
and
no
lack
of
testimony
to
align
this
case
with
a
case
such
as
dickey
which
states
that
if
a
persons
defenses
is
impaired
or
just
lost
to
some
witnesses
dying
and
disappearing
or
being
unavailable
and
i
think
this
would
distinguish
this
case
from
dickey.
though
in
the
main,
i
think
the
commonwealth
contentions
can
be
divided
into
three
categories.
the
first
is
that
if
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
valid
government
delay
that
this
case
must
meet
the
standards
and
we
base
this
on
the
fact
that
in
applying
the
demand
rule,
the
demand
was
made
after
almost
four
years,
three
and
a
half
years
had
passed.
that
the
reasons
for
the
delay
were
valid,
there
would
have
been
no
conviction
in
this
case
if
the
commonwealth
had
been
forced
to
trial
earlier
than
it
was.
there
was
no
lack
of
diligence
on
the
part
of
the
commonwealth
in
this
case.
i'm
certain
that
the
commonwealth
attorney
in
hopkins
county,
christian
county,
excuse
me,
got
very
tired
of
this
case,
he
was
in
court
with
every
open
term
of
court
or
else
manning
had
an
appeal
pending.
he
wanted
to
conclude
this
more
than
anyone
i
would
assume.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
in
christian
county
and
it
is
not
a
continuous
session.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
three
sessions,
i
believe.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
i
would
say
a
month
and
a
half
or
two
months.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
unless,
i
think
if
there
is
provision
for
a
prolong
calendar
if
the
docket
load
is
heavy,
unusually
heavy.
i
don't
think
they
are
bound
by
a
specific
termination
date
on
each
call.
so,
the
prejudice
resulting
from
this
delay
has
been
argued
was
not
great.
petitioner
was
not
the
object
of
prolonged
delay
in
order
to
gain
an
advantage.
the
government
prosecuted
this
case
with
diligence,
they
--
it
went
to
trial
the
first
open
term
of
court
that
all
the
witnesses
were
available
and
it
is
very
--
the
petitioner
was
--
came
very
close
to
not
being
tried
when
sheriff
mckinney
went
in
the
hospital.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
he
was
tried
at
the
first
term
of
court
in
october.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
two
months.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
i
think
the
murder
were
on
july
the
20
and
he
was
tried
october
9,
i
believe
is
the
date
of
his
first
trial
and
he
was
prosecuted
every
succeeding
term
of
court
or
had
an
appeal
pending
in
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
at
every
subsequent
term
of
court.
so
this
couple
with
a
fact
that
the
petitioners
defense
was
in
no
way
impaired
that
the
demand
was
not
made
until
very
late
in
the
time
period
and
the
no
lost
of
prejudice
and
the
good
cause
for
which
the
continuances
were
granted.
the
commonwealth
submits
at
these
grounds
are
sufficient
and
adequate
to
affirm
the
sixth
circuit
opinion.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
not
in
dispute.
the
commonwealth
did
delay
the
trial
of
the
petitioner
for
five
years
and
i
think
a
little
more
thorough
explanation
of
why
it
delayed
it
as
an
order,
the
commonwealth
shows
to
prosecute
silas
manning
first.
now
this
decision
i
don't
know
why
it
was
made
but
the
commonwealth
attorney
did
make
it
and
they
had
not
by
my
brother
he
--
they
did
have
a
difficulty
in
obtaining
a
valid
conviction.
i
don't
think
it
can
be
blamed
on
any
incompetence
on
the
part
of
the
commonwealth
attorney.
and
after
in
december
of
1962
when
manning's
final
trial
was
held,
trial
was
set
for
the
next
term
to
court
to
february

of
the
1963
christian
county
circuit.
the

the

of

he
became
seriously

he
was

mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
three,
1963.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
no.
it's
just
an
explanation
of
the
last
ten
months
or
so
of
the
delay.
the
first
four
years
of
the
delay
were
due
to
manning
being
unavailable
for
testimony.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
right.
and
the
commonwealth
submits
that
the
real
issue
in
this

is
not
when
the

or
if
a

confession,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
this
--
there
was
an
admission
made
by
barker
along
reliance
of
--
when
the
sheriff
came
to
arrest
him,
he
boarded
out
before
being
asked
or
told
anything.
if
you're
wondering
what
happened
to
those
old
folks,
manning
did
it.
and
that
was
--
excuse
me,
the
major
portion
of
the
sheriff's
testimony
was
his
admission.
now,
as
stated
the
reason
for
the
delay
in
this
case
is
legitimate
and
at
my
opinion,
the
interests
of
society
have
to
be
balanced
against
the
interest
of
the
accused
and
if
there
is
a
valid
reason.
if
there
can
be
any
valid
reason
for
postponement
of
a
trial
for
five
years,
this
case
presents
the
same.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
if
--
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
right
your
honor,
i
have
--
and
i
believe
the
demand
issue
is
secondary.
i
do
not
feel
that
the
accused
should
be
allowed
to
play
both
ends
against
submittal
and
sit
back
and
not
take
any
affirmative
action.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
i
don't
think
--
i
think
you
have
to
consider
both
of
them
in
a
case
such
as
this.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
right,
your
honor.
i
think
initially,
there's
very
little
guidance
on
what
constitutes
good
cause
for
the
government
delaying
the
trial.
there
are
ample
evidences
to
the
defendant
filing
dilatory
pleadings
or
shuffling
to
street
and
avoiding
trial,
being
a
fugitive,
being
incompetent.
these
do
not
violate
the
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
however,
there
is
fair
little
guidance
as
to
why
the
government
may
delay
a
trial.
the
most
decisions
have
followed
the
gleichman
(ph)
case
and
which
necessitates
a
demand
and
if
a
demand
does
not
made,
waiver
his
presumed.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
yes,
sir
that
is
meant.
there
--
the
only
prejudice
that
could
be
assumed
and
my
brother
points
out
in
his
brief
that
possible
prejudice
may
be
presumed
and
that
he
suffered
the
scorn
or
the
stigma
of
being
under
an
indictment
for
five
years
for
hearing
his
crime
such
as
murder.
there
is
no
actual
physical
tangible
prejudice
shown.
all
the
witnesses
testified,
they
were
also
witnesses
at
manning's
trial
and
by
the
petitioner's
trial
they
were
thoroughly
burst
in
their
testimony.
and
one
has
but
to
read
the
evidence
to
see
how
concrete
they
were
in
answering
their
questions.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
yes
your
honor
at
barker's
trial.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
yes
there
were
--
there
were
other
corroborating
evidence
but
it
was
not
what
one
would
consider
the
major
key
witness.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
well
the
sheriff
was
also
the
one
that
found
the
car
--
barker's
car
parking
from
the
house
next
door
and
he
had
some
other
investigative
facts
at
the
--
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
think
if
--
i
think
his
testimony
alone
would
have
been
enough
but
i
don't
think
that
some
of
the
other
testimony
would
have
been
enough
to
corroborate
manning's
testimony.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
they
initially
were
drinking
and
needed
some
money
and
they
had
heard
that
mr.
and
mrs.
denton
kept
large
sums
of
money.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
yes,
sir.
they
went
in
the
window
with
the
tire
and
proceeded.
i
think
they
hit
mrs.
denton
first
while
she
was
in
bed
but
the
--
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
no,
sir.
go
ahead.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
your
honor,
may
have
mislead
you,
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that
kentucky
has
some
statutes
there.
i
think
california
or
michigan
other
states
have
enacted.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
right
in
the
model,
the
model
penal
code
i
believe
contains
provision.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
there
were
three
others.
three
--
there
was
initial
in
february
of
1962,
there
is
one
in
the
summer
i
believe
in
july
of
1962.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
and
then
there
was
one
in
march
of
1963
in
the
summer
of
1963,
june
or
july
and
then
at
the
trial
just
before
trial
start.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
motion
dismissed
for
lack
of
--
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
--
prosecution
as
to
whether
they
--
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
yes,
sir.
but
the
motions
for
continuance
that
i
was
asking
--
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
four
motions.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
yes
sir,
february
of
1962
that
is
according
to
the
record.
i
don't
know
how
the
court,
the
district
court
and
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
got
confused
but
they
have
cited
and
in
it
is
the
first
demand
being
made
in
1963.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
your
honor,
i
picked
up
a
slip
this
morning,
when
i
became
aware
of
it,
we
did
not
have
the
advance
sheet
in
our
office
before
i
came
in
to
washington.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
well,
as
i
understand
marion
it
was
a
pre-indictment
delay
and
this
court
held
that
the
sixth
amendment
speedy
trial
clause
was
not
applicable
to
pre-indictment
delays.
now
that
the
concurring
opinion
--
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
that
was
my
opinion
that
it
did
not
-
it
was
not
applicable
to
the
pre-indictment
stage
because
a
person
had
not
become
an
accused.
back
in
the
prejudice
argument,
we
stated
that
there
were
no
lost
witnesses
that
the
witnesses
memory
was
--
there
was
no
mnemonic
loss
and
no
lack
of
testimony
to
align
this
case
with
a
case
such
as
dickey
which
states
that
if
a
persons
defenses
is
impaired
or
just
lost
to
some
witnesses
dying
and
disappearing
or
being
unavailable
and
i
think
this
would
distinguish
this
case
from
dickey.
though
in
the
main,
i
think
the
commonwealth
contentions
can
be
divided
into
three
categories.
the
first
is
that
if
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
valid
government
delay
that
this
case
must
meet
the
standards
and
we
base
this
on
the
fact
that
in
applying
the
demand
rule,
the
demand
was
made
after
almost
four
years,
three
and
a
half
years
had
passed.
that
the
reasons
for
the
delay
were
valid,
there
would
have
been
no
conviction
in
this
case
if
the
commonwealth
had
been
forced
to
trial
earlier
than
it
was.
there
was
no
lack
of
diligence
on
the
part
of
the
commonwealth
in
this
case.
i'm
certain
that
the
commonwealth
attorney
in
hopkins
county,
christian
county,
excuse
me,
got
very
tired
of
this
case,
he
was
in
court
with
every
open
term
of
court
or
else
manning
had
an
appeal
pending.
he
wanted
to
conclude
this
more
than
anyone
i
would
assume.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
in
christian
county
and
it
is
not
a
continuous
session.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
three
sessions,
i
believe.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
i
would
say
a
month
and
a
half
or
two
months.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
unless,
i
think
if
there
is
provision
for
a
prolong
calendar
if
the
docket
load
is
heavy,
unusually
heavy.
i
don't
think
they
are
bound
by
a
specific
termination
date
on
each
call.
so,
the
prejudice
resulting
from
this
delay
has
been
argued
was
not
great.
petitioner
was
not
the
object
of
prolonged
delay
in
order
to
gain
an
advantage.
the
government
prosecuted
this
case
with
diligence,
they
--
it
went
to
trial
the
first
open
term
of
court
that
all
the
witnesses
were
available
and
it
is
very
--
the
petitioner
was
--
came
very
close
to
not
being
tried
when
sheriff
mckinney
went
in
the
hospital.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
he
was
tried
at
the
first
term
of
court
in
october.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
two
months.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
i
think
the
murder
were
on
july
the
20
and
he
was
tried
october
9,
i
believe
is
the
date
of
his
first
trial
and
he
was
prosecuted
every
succeeding
term
of
court
or
had
an
appeal
pending
in
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
at
every
subsequent
term
of
court.
so
this
couple
with
a
fact
that
the
petitioners
defense
was
in
no
way
impaired
that
the
demand
was
not
made
until
very
late
in
the
time
period
and
the
no
lost
of
prejudice
and
the
good
cause
for
which
the
continuances
were
granted.
the
commonwealth
submits
at
these
grounds
are
sufficient
and
adequate
to
affirm
the
sixth
circuit
opinion.
thank
you.
