chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
number
71-5255
barker
against
wingo.
mr.
milliman,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
signal
for
that
mr.
milliman
will
be,
when
your
white
light
goes
on.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
did
he
have
counsel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
saying
in
effect
that
a
trial
is
the
last
thing
he
wants
and
therefore
he
shouldn't
be
compelled
to
ask
for
what
he
doesn't
want?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
what
you're
arguing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
he
should
not
be
compelled
to
ask
for
it
because
he
really
doesn't
want
it.
he
wants
to
postpone
that
evil
day.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
he
had
asked
--
what
if
he
had
asked
for
all
the
continuances?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
is
it
different
now
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh!but
going
back
to
your
proposition
that
the
predicate
of
your
whole
argument
here
is
that
because
death
may
await
him
down
the
end
of
the
road,
he
therefore
doesn't
want
to
trial.
that
seems
to
be
your
predicate
for
now.
that
same
urge
might
make
him
to
come
in
every
time
that
the
case
was
set
for
trial
and
ask
for
a
continuance.
what
you
say,
if
he
ask
for
it
and
got
it
that
would
be
different
from
getting
it
without
asking
for
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
you
square
with
that
with
your
earlier
argument
that
he
really
doesn't
want
a
trial
and
therefore
should
not
be
put
to
the
burden
of
asking
for
what
he
doesn't
want?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
the
witness
that
was
needed
for
this
conviction
had
been
a
fugitive
from
justice
living
in
algeria
or
canada
or
some
place
where
he
couldn't
be
reached
and
brought
back.
would
you
think
that
would
alter
the
gover
--
the
state's
posture
on
the
delay?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
is
his
test
--
was
his
testimony
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
any
more
or
less
available
in
realistic
terms
than
if
he'd
been
in
algeria?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
this
record
show
what
happened
to
mr.
manning?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yet
that
attitude
seems
to
have
not
interfered
with
his
being
placed
on
parole.
when
did
he
go
on
parole?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
milliman.
mr.
willmott.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
did
that,
that
didn't
come
until
1963?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
that
doesn't
explain
58
to
63
at
all,
doesn't
affect
that
really
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
we
had
a
ten
months
delay,
we
probably
wouldn't
be
here
on
this
case.
would
we,
probably?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
manning
did
testify
at
the
trial
that
was
finally
held?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes
and
was
-
it
be
fair
to
say
that
his
testimony
and
the
sheriff's
testimony
were
the
two
major
factors
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
i
take
it
manning
described
the
crime
that
had
been
committed
by
the
two
men
together.
and
then
the
sheriff's
testimony
with
respect
to
the
admissions,
that
was
the
corroborating
evidence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
was
to
meet
the
kentucky
requirement
of
corroborating
testimony?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
california
and
illinois
for
example.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
the
--
how
soon
after
the
event
was
manning
tried
the
first
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
for
then,
six
months
after
the
murders?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
two
months
after
the
murder.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
willmott.
mr.
milliman,
you
have
few
minutes
left,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
after
february
12,
1962,
your
anxiety
and
hostility
arguments
really
don't
square
with
your
argument
that
you
didn't
want
to
have
this
confrontation
to
society
and
that
is
why
you
didn't
ask
for
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
quite
right.
that
doesn't
justify
delay.
i
am
simply
was
addressing
that
observation
to
the
weight
of
your
argument
on
that
point.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
are
not
arguing
that
every
accused
person
is
in
the
posture
of
not
wanting
a
trial,
are
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
expect
there
might
be
more
accused
if
he
knows
he
is
guilty,
wouldn't
it
be
so
that
you
can't
really
generalize
on
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
have
--
if
counsel
makes
a
decision,
it's
better
to
wait
than
to
try
now,
that
might
be
a
gross
error
but
it
might
not
be
a
gross
error.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
isn't
that
reasonably
assumed
that
he
knew
the
problem
of
the
unavailability
of
manning
until
manning's
conviction
was
definite?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
it
reasonable
to
assume
that
when
the
prosecution
asked
for
continuances,
the
--
they
were
required
to
give
a
reason
and
the
reason
was,
that
manning
was
not
available?
that
was
known
to
everybody?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
do
you
mean
that
manning
would
have
been
a
willing
witness
just
because
he
had
a
conviction
with
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
i
think
your
time
is
up.
