that
new

has
applied
to
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
understood
that
the
last
affidavit
is
the
one
that
is
in
pages
26
that
apparently
was
sworn
to
on
the
third
day
of
february
1970.
at
that
time
he
was
not
--
i
do
not
understand,
he
was
a
physician,
but
a
medical
student.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
he
now
a
physician
or?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
had
graduated
from
the
medical
school?
and
you
think
it
might
well
i
suppose
he
is
having
an
internship.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
are
not
arguing
that
if
it
were
possible
to
pursue
one
of
these
alternatives
facts
if
it
were,
you
say
it
did
not,
if
it
were,
you
do
not
argue
that
nevertheless
constitutionally
he
is
entitled
to
proper
transcript,
do
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
are
we
to
do
with
the
facts
as
i
understand
it,
you
did
not
pursue,
made
no
attempt
to
pursue
one
of
the
alternative
methods?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
the
affidavit
to
make
out
a
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice

from
attempting
either
the
alternative
methods?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
your
position?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
you
are
trying
to
say
in
the
illinois
court
why
it
was
you
had
not
pursued
the
alternative
method?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
requested
in
the
supreme
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
did
you
go,
besides
the
supreme
court,
only
to
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
did
you
argue
in
the
circuit
court
you
had
to
have
a
transcript
because
the
alternative
method
could
be
inadequate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
the
rule
did
not
apply
for
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
argue
this
all
in
the
supreme
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
you
submitted,
did
it
make
any
effort
to
say
why
you
had
to
have
the
transcript
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
matter
of
alternative
was
fully
briefed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
this
point
(inaudible)
on
what
record
does
the
supreme
court
of
--
is
it
in
the
supreme
court
of
illinois?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
what
record
will
the
appeal
be
concentrated?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
federal
statement
--
does
that
require
agreements
between
the
plaintiffs?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
there
is
disagreement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
there
is
disagreement,
who
settles
the
statement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
may
still
be
done
even
if
this
(voice
overlap)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
long
was
this
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
probably
does
the
--
will
the
trial
judge,
if
you
follow
that
method
and
you
and
mr.
field
could
not
agree
on
the
settled
statement
and
the
trial
judge
had
to
instruct
it,
would
he
have
available
the
transcript
for
that
purpose?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
my
question
mr.
curry
was
would
the
trial
judge,
that
if
it
made
available
to
the
trial
judge
so
that
he
could
resolve
the
dispute
between
you
and
mr.
field,
and
(inaudible)
settled
statement
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
this
mr.
curry.
are
you
suggesting
in
connection
with
the
pending
appeal
in
the
supreme
court,
it's
still
open
to
mayer
to
demonstrate
that
the
alternative
methods
are
inadequate,
is
that
still
open
in
connection
with
that
appeal
in
the
supreme
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
now
--
and
if
the
succeeded
in
persuading
the
supreme
court
that
the
alternative
method
will
not
be
adequate
to
present
his
appeal,
would
it
fallow
that
the
supreme
court
would
then
order
a
transcript?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
notwithstanding
the
language
of
the
rule
that
limits
the
transcript
to
felony
cases?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
am
thinking
of
this
case,
mr.
field
with
connection
with
a
pending
appeal,
demonstrates
that
an
alternative
method
would
be
inadequate,
would
the
supreme
court
require
that
he'd
be
furnished
the
transcript?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
one
question
before
you
sit
down?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
am
looking
at
your
rule
323
(c)
that
is
on
the
alternative,
at
page
4
(a)
and
i
think
it
is
the
petitioner's
brief.
i
know
(inaudible)
the
capture
that
rule
is
procedure
if
no
verbatim
transcript
is
available?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
is
on
the
page
that
i
would
suppose
mean
that
it
been
no
transcript
taken
or
something
like
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
seems
--
it
seems
broader
--
the
rule
the
rule
itself
be
not
available
if
no
verbatim
transcript
to
the
evidence
of
proceedings
is
obtainable.
now,
are
they
synonymous
available

obtainable,

on
