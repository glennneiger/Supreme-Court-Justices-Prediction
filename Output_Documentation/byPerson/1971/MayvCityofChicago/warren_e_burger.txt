an

chief

chief

or
would
it
be
removed
from

automatically
or
with
just
the
$5.00
a

the

chief

warren
e.

that

chief

mr.
field
before
you
go
on,
i
am
not
sure
how
important
it
is,
but
i
am
a
little
surprised
that
you
seem
the
think
that
the
present
status
of
the
petitioner,
his
financial
status,
it
is
not
relevant,
that
it
must
stand
on
his
status
at
the
time
the
case
arose.
what
if
hypothetically
if
he
had
a
million
dollars
between
now
and
then
and
that
is
demonstrable
and
was
demonstrated.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it
does
not
have
something
to
do
whether
this
court
should
be
devoting
its
time
to
the
case
on
the
grounds
of
indigency?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh!
no
it
is
not.
would
it
not
be
rather
remarkable
to
think
of
a
young
man,
a
relatively
young
man
who
has
degree
of
doctor
medicine
today
in
the
united
states
being
indigent?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
do
not
mean
to
suggest
that
we
would
hold
you
to
knowing
at
the
present
instance
his
financial
situation.
i
do
not
mean
that
at
all.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
i
understand
that
you
either
be
suggesting
that
if
that
situation
is
irrelevant
to
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
would
we
be
concerned
about
what
they
are
doing
in
other
cases
or
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
what
they
are
doing
in
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
long
did
the
case
take
to
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
suggest
a
hypothesis
as
to
how
appeals
were
thoroughly
conducted
years
ago
when
there
was
no
recorder
and
there
was
no
transcript
that
the
bill
of
exceptions
or
by
whatever
name
it
was
called
the
claims
of
error
were
reproduced
for
the
appellate
court
by
counsel
relying
on
there
recollection
with
or
without
total
recall.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
mean
for
115
years,
we
were
in
this
country
processing
all
appeals
inadequately,
including
appeals
for
a
rich
man?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
representing
that
in
a
two-day
trial
a
trained
lawyer
cannot
reproduce,
two
trained
lawyers
cannot
reproduce
the
substance
and
the
essence
of
the
testimony
that's
given
in
the
trial.
is
that
your
suggestion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
you
have
an
associate
with
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
--
do
you
represent
that
the
day
after
or
the
week
after
you
could
not
sit
down
yourself
to
make
a
synopsis
of
the
testimony
of
each
witness
of
that
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
you
could
not
do
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
can
you
say
inadequate,
if
you
never
tried
to
do
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
say
that
your
presentation
to
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
was
substantially
the
presentation
which
you
had
made
to
us
here?
chief

that

some
of
that,
yes
we
are

interested

could
he,
i
may
put
a
specific
question,
could
mr.
field
or
someone
representing
the
petitioner
here
require
the
court
reporter
to
read
his
notes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
would
have
among
other
powers,
the
power
to
order
a
transcript
under
each
supervisory
jurisdiction
overall
lesser
courts
in

chief

warren
e.

independent
of

the
rule
it
has
defined
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
this
is
a
matter
of
discretion
on
the
part
of
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
your
argument
would
mean
that
if
the
trial
court
has
--
in

level
has
that
discussion,
supreme
court
of
illinois
it
has
it
within
its
supervisory
power?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
happens
to
judge
--
haven't
you
already
told
us
counsel
that
on
all
unresolved
matters
of
a
settled
statement,
the
judge
resolves?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
the
parties
put
down
on
paper
what
is
agreed
on
and
the
judge
supplies
the
vacant
spots,
where
they
are
not
going
to
--
chief

warren
e.

was
any
request
ever
made
by
the

defendant
for
having
a

read
any
parts

chief
