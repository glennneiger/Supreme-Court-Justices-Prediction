mr.
henry
f.
field
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
raises
once
again
the
issue
first
raised
and
decided
by
this
court
15
years
ago
in
griffin
versus
illinois
of
whether
the
fourteenth
amendment
requires
that
a
state
which
provides
appeals
of
right
and
reporters
who
transcribe
trials
provide
a
poor
person
who
is
unable
to
pay
for
that
transcript
and
who
needs
that
transcript
to
demonstrate
crucial
trial
errors
so
that
he
may
have
an
adequate
and
effective
review
and
may
adequately
exercise
his
right
of
appeal.
this
case
today
arises
under
illinois
supreme
court
rule
607
which
at
the
time
of
trial
and
until
very
recently
provided
that
only
defendants
in
felony
cases
had,
indigent
defendants,
had
a
right
to
apply
for
free
transcript
from
the
state
of
illinois.
as
of
july
1st
of
this
year
that
rule
has
been
amended
so
that
it
now
provides
that
any
defendant
who
at
the
time
of
trial
faced
a
penalty
greater
than
six
months
in
jail
could
apply
to
illinois
for
a
transcript.
mr.
henry
f.
field
pardon
me?
mr.
henry
f.
field
no.
your
honor.
it
did
not?
mr.
henry
f.
field
no,
i
do
not
believe
it
affects
the
case
in
anyway.
mr.
henry
f.
field
here
the
possible
penalty
at
the
time
of
trial
was
$1000.00
fine
and
no
jail
term
at
least
initially.
mr.
henry
f.
field
well,
illinois
does-
mr.
henry
f.
field
yes.
mr.
henry
f.
field
illinois
provides
that
a
defendant
has
to
pay
off,
work
off
the
fine
of
$5.00
a
day
and
that
is
the
contingency
in
a
case
which
leaves
a
possible
jail
sanction,
but
after
this
court's
decision
in
tate
versus
short
of
last
year,
this
question
is
perhaps
removed
from
the
case
although
still,
there
are
still
some
uncertainty
i
believe
in
the
construction
of
that
case.
mr.
henry
f.
field
well,
the
effect
of
tate
versus
short,
were
it
applied
to
this
case,
would
be
as
i
understand
the
case
that
the
defendant
here
could
not
be
put
in
jail
at
the
rate
of
$5.00
a
day,
if
he
did
not
pay
the
fine,
was
not
able
to
pay
the
fine
that
he
was
sentenced
to.
mr.
henry
f.
field
no.
mr.
henry
f.
field
only
if
the
defendants
at
the
time
of
trial
faced
a
penalty
of
greater
than
six
months
in
jail
and
does
not
include
the
contingency
of
six
months
worked
off
through
fine.
mr.
henry
f.
field
i
do
not
believe
that
even
at
the
$5.00
rate
this
defendant
would
be
in
jail
for
more
that
six
months.
so
that
the
point
would
not
be
raised,
yes.
mr.
henry
f.
field
he
was
sentenced
at
trial
for
$500.00
fine.
he
faced
a
thousand
and
sentenced
to
500
and
i
believe
that
he
could
not
be
put
be
in
jail
then
in
illinois
in
rate
of
more
than
a
100
days.
i
would
not
belabor
the
court
with
any
kind
of
discussion
of,
lengthy
discussion
of
the
rule
law
in
this
case
as
you
all
are
familiar
with
griffin
that
established
the
principle
that
the
destitute
defendant
must
be
afforded
as
adequate
appellate
review
as
persons
who
can
afford
transcripts.
just
last
year
in
williams
versus
oklahoma
city
this
court
decided
a
drunk
driving
case
where
the
defendant
faced
90
days
in
jail
and
in
unanimous
per
curiam
opinion
had
no
trouble
applying
griffin
to
the
facts.
rule
607
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
--
mr.
henry
f.
field
he
is
now
in
california.
i
cannot
fully
posses
the
circumstances
but
he
has
moved
from
new
york
where
he
originally
was.
mr.
henry
f.
field
i
prefer
not
to
make
representations
about
his
apparent
status
because
i
am
really
not
to
fully
informed.
the
record
has
nothing
in
it
concerning
his
present
circumstances
and
i
have
not
made
myself
to
aware
of
those.
mr.
henry
f.
field
as
my
belief
that
he
is
your
honor,
indigent
today.
mr.
henry
f.
field
yes.
he
has
that
--
i
do
have
some
information
concerning
him
and
that
information
to
my
knowledge
has
not
changed
his
indigency
status.
he
still
cannot
pay
for
the
transcript.
he
is
not
a
leaving
at
anything
about
necessaries,
but
as
i
want
emphasis
i
am
not
fully
informed
on
that
fact,
on
that
point.
mr.
henry
f.
field
yes.
after
the
trial
the
petitioner
filed
an
affidavit
and
there
was
full
hearing
on
this
question
of
his
indigency
where
the
city
was
represented
and
attacked
it
and
the
acting
chief
judge
of
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county
found
that
he
was
indeed
indigent
and
unable
to
pay
for
the
$300.00
transcript.
mr.
henry
f.
field
yes.
the
rule
607
of
illinois
supreme
court
wholly
denies
a
transcript
to
this
appellant
who
faced
a
$1000.00
fine
and
regardless
of
his
need
for
it
and
he
needs
that
transcript
as
i
will
demonstrate
in
order
to
raise
the
really
central
point
of
this
trial
and
rule
607
also
wholly
denies
an
opportunity
to
the
all
indigent
persons
to
show
and
demonstrate
to
illinois
that
they
need
a
transcript
in
order
to
raise
points
at
evidence
and
the
kind
and
possibly
unconstitutional
conduct
of
their
trials
and
it
completely
insulates
trials
of
indigents
from
the
review
in
cases
involving
less
than
six
months
in
jail.
it's
appellant’s
contention
that
this
blanket
prohibition
of
all
indigent
now
under
six
months
and
under
appeals
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
several
respects.
first
illinois
has
chosen
to
draw
an
invidious
line
between
rich
and
poor
in
violation
of
this
court's
clear
mandate
in
griffin
and
williams
and
many
cases
elaborating
those
principles.
secondly,
it
hides
and
insulates
from
any
appellate
correction
unconstitutional
errors,
in
this
case
the
denial
of
fair
trial.
the
facts
of
the
case
necessarily
skimpy,
can
be
briefly
stated.
mr.
henry
f.
field
well,
that
is
of-course
—-
mr.
henry
f.
field
that
could
be
true
your
honor
and
that's
not
of
course
a
situation.
mr.
henry
f.
field
well,
my
understanding
that
he
had
tremendous
debts
and
that
i
just
feel
very
strongly
that
this
case
had
gone
through
the
full
hearing
of
indigency
and
that
this
situation
basically
has
not
changed
and
i
know
nothing
that
would
change
that
and
--
mr.
henry
f.
field
if
the
court
would
leave.
mr.
henry
f.
field
well,
were
he
a
millionaire,
i
could
conceive
how
it
could
be
irrelevant
because
of
the
method
that
illinois
has
chosen
to
completely
deny
transcripts
to
indigents
in
nine
to
six
months
cases.
mr.
henry
f.
field
yes,
i
think
it,
well
--
mr.
henry
f.
field
well,
i
think
this
case
of-course
is
important
and
his
ability
to
pay
now
might
indeed
change
the
court's
whole
posture
on
the
situation.
however,
this
court
has
a
record
before
it
which
i
believe
is
complete
and
illinois
by
hesitating
can
frustrate
this
court's
enforcement
of
fourteenth
amendment
by
--
as
it
has
in
this
case,
forcing
defendants
to
appeal
and
because
time
is
always
money,
raise
in
any
indigent
case
a
question
as
to
it
his
ability
to
pay
for
a
transcript.
mr.
henry
f.
field
that
is
true.
mr.
henry
f.
field
frankly,
your
honor
i
am
not
certain
what
a
physician
is
since
he
has
to
my
understanding
graduated.
mr.
henry
f.
field
this
i
believe
it
was
a
summer
and
he
is
been
working
in
a
hospital
for
several
months.
mr.
henry
f.
field
yes.
i
suppose
that
is
correct.
mr.
henry
f.
field
i
do
not
know
what
he
is
getting.
i
have
no
knowledge
of
it.
mr.
henry
f.
field
no.
he
is
only
been
working
very,
very
briefly.
basically
what
happened
was
that
this
defendant
was
a
participant
as
a
medical
apprentice
while
he
was
in
the
medical
school,
first
aid
assistance
at
the
scene
of
a
demonstration
in
chicago,
march
and
rally,
which
was
sponsored
by
sts
and
various
other
anti
war
at
that
time
groups
and
he
came
upon
a
injured
victim
and
interacted
with
the
police
under
circumstances
which
were
the
subject
of
a
two-day
jury
trial.
mr.
henry
f.
field
well,
that
of
course
is
the
transcript
which
is
not
present
in
the
case
and
what
happened
--
mr.
henry
f.
field
he
is
charged
with
two
city
chicago
municipal
offenses.
mr.
henry
f.
field
disorderly
conduct
and
interfering
with
the
police
and
he
was
sentenced
to
$500
and
i
represented
this
defendant
at
trial.
after
the
trial
--
mr.
henry
f.
field
no
jail,
no
jail
was
possible
except
as
we
discussed
extensively.
mr.
henry
f.
field
after
the
trial
he
filed
a
post
trial
motion
which
raised
several
substantial
contentions,
attacking
the
legitimacy
of
the
verdict
and
a
judgment
of
a
case.
his
basic
point
was
that
he
has
convicted
on
insufficient
evidence
compounded
of
grossly
prejudicial
prosecutorial
misconduct,
he
was
denied
in
the
fair
trial
and
the
cumulative
effect
was
to
override,
wholly
override
the
evidence
in
the
case.
as
stated
in
affidavit
of
counsel
at
the
--
in
the
post
trial
motion
and
before
the
--
and
the
motion
in
illinois
supreme
court,
it
was
our
feeling
that
the
defendant
was
convicted
not
for
what
he
did,
but
for
sins
of
sts
and
for
unreal
--
wholly
unrelated,
but
contemporaneous
injury
to
one
richard
elroy
(ph)
who
vaulted,
who
was
them
an
obscure
city
lawyer
in
a
prosecutor's
office
and
vaulted
in
the
front
page
of
chicago
papers
all
during
the
preliminary
portion
this
trial
and
the
time
between
his
arrest
and
trial
and
proceeded
from
the
front
pages
of
chicago
papers
to
elective
officers,
now
sheriff
of
cook
county.
after
this
motion
was
denied
and
we
learned
the
cost
of
a
transcript
is
well
beyond
his
means,
we
moved
in
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county
for
three
things,
appointment
of
counsel,
production
of
a
transcript
and
a
waiver
filing
fees.
after
lengthy
hearing
this,
the
court
found
that
he
was
indigent
and
unable
to
pay,
but
refused
to
grant
him
access
to
the
transcript
on
ground
that
rule
607
applies
only
to
felony
cases.
the
order
is
--
order
that
the
motion
of
a
defendant
for
relief
proceed
as
poor
person.
he
and
it's
hereby
denied
on
the
grounds
that
defendant
was
found
guilty
of
ordinance
violations
and
that
rule
607
of
the
supreme
court
applies
to
felony
cases.
we
renewed
the
motion
in
the
illinois
supreme
court
and
urged
the
unconstitutionality,
the
approach
taken
by
illinois
rule
607.
the
motion,
after
due
consideration,
for
counsel
and
transcript
was
denied
and
filing
fees
were
waived.
mr.
henry
f.
field
yes,
that
is
provided
in
other
sections
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
rules
and
there
are
two
basic
methods
for
proceeding.
the
first
method
is
to
get
an
agreed
statement
and
the
second
method
is
to
get
a
--
if
you
cannot
agree
to
get
a
settled
statement,
agree
with
the
prosecution
and
i
suppose
the
court.
mr.
henry
f.
field
neither
method
was
pursued
in
this
case
and
the
reason
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
contention
here.
it
is
the
position
of
the
defendant
and
appellant
here
that
very
clearly
on
the
face
of
his
contentions,
neither
alternatives
are
adequate,
neither
alternatives
adequate.
the
two
contentions;
one
of
insufficiency
in
the
evidence
and
one
of
grossly
prejudicial
misconduct,
both
require
the
kind
of
detailed
survey
of
the
facts
of
the
case.
the
words
used,
the
question
supposed,
the
answers
and
responses
which
only
a
transcript
could
provide
and
which
no
one
connected
to
the
case,
having
total
recall,
could
possibly
reconstruct.
mr.
henry
f.
field
my
best
recollection
is
it
was
two
days,
but
there
was
possibly
some
spill
over
to
a
third
day
for
--
mr.
henry
f.
field
there
would
be
no
way
to
adequately
present
an
appeal
on
these
contentions
in
that
circumstance.
mr.
henry
f.
field
well,
if
there
were
scribes
at
trial
or
to
people
helping
attorneys
who
could
take
down
the
detailed
testimony
that
could
have
not
been
true,
but
in
this
case
the
problem
was
that
he
was
poor
and
he
had
only
his
counsel
and—
mr.
henry
f.
field
that
maybe
possible
i
think
in
most
cases,
but
that
not
certainly
not
the
case
here
because
the
nature
--
mr.
henry
f.
field
no,
i
did
not
take
care
for
notes.
i
took
some
notes
and
i
--
but
i
was
conducting
the
cross
examination
and
i
knew
that
the
transcript
was
either
reporter
was
present
and
that
--
mr.
henry
f.
field
no.
there
was
no
one
from
the
case
and
i
think
that
the
nature
of
the
contention,
the
key
to
why
a
transcript
is
required
to
this
case
because
the
contention
on
introduction
of
the
evidence
was
that
the
police,
some
certain
police
testimony
which
the
purport
of
which
was
to
show
this
man,
the
defendant
to
be
violent
man,
was
inherently
incredible
and
was
demonstrated
to
be
such
by
other
testimony
at
the
trial
and
by
the
cross
examination
by
myself,
lengthy
cross
examination
of
the
police
witnesses.
mr.
henry
f.
field
that
is
absolutely
true
as
to
this
two
contentions,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
f.
field
i
could
do,
i
could
make
synopsis
of
much
of
the
testimony.
there
is
no
doubt
that
i
can
recall
a
great
deal
that
went
on,
but
there
is
no
way
that
i
can
recall
the
kind
detailed
questioning
and
the
words
used
that
precise
words
used
that
go
to
show
the
nature
of
the
prejudicial
attack
of
the
prosecutor
as
intensive
systematic
effort
to
hang
this
defendant,
not
for
the
facts
of
what
happened
with
his
interaction
with
the
police,
but
for
--
on
wholly
related
matters
and
sins
of
others
and
injury
to
mr.
richard
elroy
which
was
the
really
prime
focus
of
the
persecution.
i
believe
that
i
can
show
that
with
a
transcript.
i
could
that
the
first
witness
in
the
case
is
put
on
solely
for
the
reason
of
interjecting
into
this
trial,
the
name,
well
known
to
everyone
of
richard
elroy.
mr.
henry
f.
field
richard
elroy
is
now
the
sheriff
of
cook
county.
mr.
henry
f.
field
at
the
time
of
incident
here,
out
of
which
this
case
arises,
he
was
an
obscure
city
lawyer
in
the
corporation
counsel’s
office,
a
prosecutor
for
the
city
of
chicago.
that
he
was
--
this
appears
from
the
affidavit,
these
facts
appear
on
affidavit
of
counsel
in
brief
at
12.
he
vaulted
from
obscurity
into
the
front
pages
and
into
elective
office
on
the
basis
of
his
injury
which
occurred
during
this
same
anti
war
demonstration.
two
rules
of
illinois
law
also
combine
to
make
overwhelming
the
impossibility
of
this
defendant
reconstructing
the
nature,
the
words
used,
inadequate,
a
minimally
adequate
factual
predicate
for
presenting
these
two
contentions.
first
of
all
under
illinois
law
the
defendant,
if
there
is
any
disagreement
as
to
the
facts,
must
prove
desperation
of
the
facts.
at
a
hearing
on
effect
under
rule,
illinois
supreme
court
rule
323,
i
believe
which
is
a
settled
statement
rule
and
in
this
situation
there
is
no
way
that
i
could
or
anyone
could
prove
the
detailed
and
intensive
prejudicial
conduct
of
the
prosecutor.
the
words
used,
how
could
i
prove,
how
could
anyone
prove
something
they
cannot
recall?
the
second
rule
of
law
creating
a
hurdle
to
an
adequate
review,
inadequate
alternative
is
that
the
appellate
courts
of
illinois
presumed
the
facts
against
the
defendant,
if
inadequate
record
is
not
provided
for
at
least
to
support
the
contentions
on
appeal
and
there
is
no
way
that
this
defendant
can
create
minimally
adequate
factual
predicate
for
these
two
contentions.
he
could
create
to
settled
and
agreed
statement
on
many
other
facts
in
the
case
but
there
is
now
way
he
can
proceed.
mr.
henry
f.
field
no
i
do
not
argue
that
your
honor
in
this
case.
mr.
henry
f.
field
that
point
is
made
by
the
state
attorney
in
capacity
as
amicus
and
i
think
the
answer
to
that
there
has
to
be
a
clear
recognition
that
based
on
the
affidavit
and
others
facts
of
record
--
mr.
henry
f.
field
they
may
got
a
very
clear
case.
mr.
henry
f.
field
that
they
show,
they
demonstrate.
mr.
henry
f.
field
that
is
my
position.
i
would
change
the
words
slightly.
they
demonstrate
that
is
impossible
for
--
that
this
was
impossible
for
this
defendant
to
proceed
without
being
caught
in
that
fine
of
either
submitting
a
settled
or
agreed
statement
which
was
he
knew
to
be
wholly
inadequate
which
could
not
start
to
create
the
minimum
factual
predicate
for
these
two
points
and
if
it
is
agreed
upon,
if
the
prosecutor
and
if
i
where
the
prosecutor
i
would
think
it
very
smart
to
agree
to
the
statement,
knowing
full
well
that's
inadequate.
what
if
he
creates
--
leaves
--
mr.
henry
f.
field
well,
i
have
to
--
the
counsel
and
the
defendant
have
to
create
the
factual
statement
and
there
is
no
way
without
total
recall
that
i
can
demonstrate
and
create
a
factual
record
on
these
two
points.
they
require
close
attention
to
the
words
used
and
the
questions
posed
on
cross
examination
and
direct
examination
--
mr.
henry
f.
field
pardon,
mr.
justice
brennan?
mr.
henry
f.
field
no.
mr.
henry
f.
field
well,
we
had
the
hearing
and
the
denial
in
the
circuit
court
and
then
in
the
supreme
court.
mr.
henry
f.
field
i
do
not
have
a
transcript
and
i
frankly
have
forgotten
what
i
argued,
but
i
was
totally
foreclosed
from
seeking
of
transcript
because
of
the
judge's
legal
ruling
that
i
could
not
regardless
of
my
need
for
it
and
the
nature
of
contentions
that
were
raised,
get
one
under
rule
607.
mr.
henry
f.
field
because
the
rule
applied
only
to
felony
cases.
mr.
henry
f.
field
no.
this
was
submitted
on
papers.
mr.
henry
f.
field
yes,
in
the
supreme
court,
this
was
--
in
illinois
supreme
court
this
was
fully
briefed,
this
point
and
demonstrated
why.
mr.
henry
f.
field
oh!
yes.
this
was
and
in
fact
the
--
except
from
the
affidavit
of
counsel
appears
in
the
brief,
as
to
why
it
is
impossible.
mr.
henry
f.
field
i
believe
so
your
honor,
that
the
course
of
trial
as
to
the
prejudicial
conduct
of
prosecution
was
denied
in
fair
trial.
the
course
of
trial
was,
has
to
be
examined.
illinois
requires
that
in
order
to
judge
the
impact
of
a
prejudicial
conduct
or
large,
you
must
survey
the
whole
record.
there
is
now
way
that
i
could
or
anyone
could
reconstruct
the
record,
although
they
could
as
you
point
out
reconstruct
many
things
in
the
record.
there
is
no
way
that
he
can
reconstruct
this
point
and
the
point
of
insufficiency
of
evidence
inherent
from
credibility
of
certain
police
testimony
which
would
permit
him
to
be
acquitted
on
appeal.
mr.
henry
f.
field
i
think
that
williams
versus
oklahoma
city
indicates
that
wherever
an
appeal
is
granted
to
all
defendants
that
the
appeal
may
not
be
denied
in
effect
poor
defendants
because
of
inability
to
buy
a
transcript.
now,
of
course
your
hypothetical
doesn't,
isn't
this
case.
mr.
henry
f.
field
yes,
i
realize
that.
mr.
henry
f.
field
yes,
i
think
that
you
have
to
examine
the
real
life
impact
on
the
defendant
in
a
particular
case
and
at
some
point
the
question
your
--
the
point
your
question
raises
is
that
at
some
point
certain
offenses
are
so
trivial
and
unimportant
that
even
the
fourteenth
amendment
should
not
be
applied
to
require
a
transcript
and
that
i
would
not
be
able
say
hypothetically
without
an
examination
of
a
real
case
and
i
just
want
sit
on
that
case
and
listen
to
the
--
mr.
henry
f.
field
no,
i
definitely
would
not
your
honor.
i
think
that
this
case
demonstrates
the
crudity
and
injustice
of
that
rule,
that
is
--
mr.
henry
f.
field
i
think
that
i
would
look
at
the
realities
of
the
detriment.
that
is
if
it
is
a
fishing
license
case,
take
a
hypothetical,
it
might
well
be
that
fishing
license
--
fishing
without
a
license
in
a
certain
area
of
the
world
is
the
next
heinous,
most
heinous
sin
to
murder
and
in
that
situation
i
would
think
that
a
transcript
would
be
required
although
a
small
fine
perhaps
was
involved.
i
would
look
at
the
particular
impact
on
a
particular
defendant
in
cases
that
arise.
mr.
henry
f.
field
yes.
mr.
henry
f.
field
yes.
mr.
henry
f.
field
yes.
the
appendix
to
the
reply
brief
does
have
a
brief
synopsis
of
what
i
believe
to
be
the
situation
in
regard
to
reporting
of
trial
generally.
mr.
henry
f.
field
yes,
no
throughout
country,
at
least
in
the
states
we
surveyed.
it
is
my
understanding
that
in
many
jurisdictions
there
are
no
--
there
is
no
stenographicaly
transcribed
--
mr.
henry
f.
field
--
at
trial,
but
in
those
jurisdictions
you
have
de
novo
review
the
circuit
court
and
the
court
of
general
jurisdiction
where
you
can
be
retried
and
universally
in
those
cases,
there
is
stenographic
--
mr.
henry
f.
field
well,
if
you
had
a
trial
de
novo
--
mr.
henry
f.
field
you
get
a
transcript
and
i
do
not
think
that
there
would
be
a
problem.
mr.
henry
f.
field
the
important
thing
in
examining
the
impact
on
this
defendant
here
is
an
alternative
if
that
he
needs
to
wipe
his
slate
clean
and
as
the
briefs
examined
his
future
and
i
believe
that
is
real
mistake.
mr.
henry
f.
field
thank
you.
mr.
henry
f.
field
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
raises
once
again
the
issue
first
raised
and
decided
by
this
court
15
years
ago
in
griffin
versus
illinois
of
whether
the
fourteenth
amendment
requires
that
a
state
which
provides
appeals
of
right
and
reporters
who
transcribe
trials
provide
a
poor
person
who
is
unable
to
pay
for
that
transcript
and
who
needs
that
transcript
to
demonstrate
crucial
trial
errors
so
that
he
may
have
an
adequate
and
effective
review
and
may
adequately
exercise
his
right
of
appeal.
this
case
today
arises
under
illinois
supreme
court
rule
607
which
at
the
time
of
trial
and
until
very
recently
provided
that
only
defendants
in
felony
cases
had,
indigent
defendants,
had
a
right
to
apply
for
free
transcript
from
the
state
of
illinois.
as
of
july
1st
of
this
year
that
rule
has
been
amended
so
that
it
now
provides
that
any
defendant
who
at
the
time
of
trial
faced
a
penalty
greater
than
six
months
in
jail
could
apply
to
illinois
for
a
transcript.
mr.
henry
f.
field
pardon
me?
mr.
henry
f.
field
no.
your
honor.
it
did
not?
mr.
henry
f.
field
no,
i
do
not
believe
it
affects
the
case
in
anyway.
mr.
henry
f.
field
here
the
possible
penalty
at
the
time
of
trial
was
$1000.00
fine
and
no
jail
term
at
least
initially.
mr.
henry
f.
field
well,
illinois
does-
mr.
henry
f.
field
yes.
mr.
henry
f.
field
illinois
provides
that
a
defendant
has
to
pay
off,
work
off
the
fine
of
$5.00
a
day
and
that
is
the
contingency
in
a
case
which
leaves
a
possible
jail
sanction,
but
after
this
court's
decision
in
tate
versus
short
of
last
year,
this
question
is
perhaps
removed
from
the
case
although
still,
there
are
still
some
uncertainty
i
believe
in
the
construction
of
that
case.
mr.
henry
f.
field
well,
the
effect
of
tate
versus
short,
were
it
applied
to
this
case,
would
be
as
i
understand
the
case
that
the
defendant
here
could
not
be
put
in
jail
at
the
rate
of
$5.00
a
day,
if
he
did
not
pay
the
fine,
was
not
able
to
pay
the
fine
that
he
was
sentenced
to.
mr.
henry
f.
field
no.
mr.
henry
f.
field
only
if
the
defendants
at
the
time
of
trial
faced
a
penalty
of
greater
than
six
months
in
jail
and
does
not
include
the
contingency
of
six
months
worked
off
through
fine.
mr.
henry
f.
field
i
do
not
believe
that
even
at
the
$5.00
rate
this
defendant
would
be
in
jail
for
more
that
six
months.
so
that
the
point
would
not
be
raised,
yes.
mr.
henry
f.
field
he
was
sentenced
at
trial
for
$500.00
fine.
he
faced
a
thousand
and
sentenced
to
500
and
i
believe
that
he
could
not
be
put
be
in
jail
then
in
illinois
in
rate
of
more
than
a
100
days.
i
would
not
belabor
the
court
with
any
kind
of
discussion
of,
lengthy
discussion
of
the
rule
law
in
this
case
as
you
all
are
familiar
with
griffin
that
established
the
principle
that
the
destitute
defendant
must
be
afforded
as
adequate
appellate
review
as
persons
who
can
afford
transcripts.
just
last
year
in
williams
versus
oklahoma
city
this
court
decided
a
drunk
driving
case
where
the
defendant
faced
90
days
in
jail
and
in
unanimous
per
curiam
opinion
had
no
trouble
applying
griffin
to
the
facts.
rule
607
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
--
mr.
henry
f.
field
he
is
now
in
california.
i
cannot
fully
posses
the
circumstances
but
he
has
moved
from
new
york
where
he
originally
was.
mr.
henry
f.
field
i
prefer
not
to
make
representations
about
his
apparent
status
because
i
am
really
not
to
fully
informed.
the
record
has
nothing
in
it
concerning
his
present
circumstances
and
i
have
not
made
myself
to
aware
of
those.
mr.
henry
f.
field
as
my
belief
that
he
is
your
honor,
indigent
today.
mr.
henry
f.
field
yes.
he
has
that
--
i
do
have
some
information
concerning
him
and
that
information
to
my
knowledge
has
not
changed
his
indigency
status.
he
still
cannot
pay
for
the
transcript.
he
is
not
a
leaving
at
anything
about
necessaries,
but
as
i
want
emphasis
i
am
not
fully
informed
on
that
fact,
on
that
point.
mr.
henry
f.
field
yes.
after
the
trial
the
petitioner
filed
an
affidavit
and
there
was
full
hearing
on
this
question
of
his
indigency
where
the
city
was
represented
and
attacked
it
and
the
acting
chief
judge
of
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county
found
that
he
was
indeed
indigent
and
unable
to
pay
for
the
$300.00
transcript.
mr.
henry
f.
field
yes.
the
rule
607
of
illinois
supreme
court
wholly
denies
a
transcript
to
this
appellant
who
faced
a
$1000.00
fine
and
regardless
of
his
need
for
it
and
he
needs
that
transcript
as
i
will
demonstrate
in
order
to
raise
the
really
central
point
of
this
trial
and
rule
607
also
wholly
denies
an
opportunity
to
the
all
indigent
persons
to
show
and
demonstrate
to
illinois
that
they
need
a
transcript
in
order
to
raise
points
at
evidence
and
the
kind
and
possibly
unconstitutional
conduct
of
their
trials
and
it
completely
insulates
trials
of
indigents
from
the
review
in
cases
involving
less
than
six
months
in
jail.
it's
appellant’s
contention
that
this
blanket
prohibition
of
all
indigent
now
under
six
months
and
under
appeals
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
several
respects.
first
illinois
has
chosen
to
draw
an
invidious
line
between
rich
and
poor
in
violation
of
this
court's
clear
mandate
in
griffin
and
williams
and
many
cases
elaborating
those
principles.
secondly,
it
hides
and
insulates
from
any
appellate
correction
unconstitutional
errors,
in
this
case
the
denial
of
fair
trial.
the
facts
of
the
case
necessarily
skimpy,
can
be
briefly
stated.
mr.
henry
f.
field
well,
that
is
of-course
—-
mr.
henry
f.
field
that
could
be
true
your
honor
and
that's
not
of
course
a
situation.
mr.
henry
f.
field
well,
my
understanding
that
he
had
tremendous
debts
and
that
i
just
feel
very
strongly
that
this
case
had
gone
through
the
full
hearing
of
indigency
and
that
this
situation
basically
has
not
changed
and
i
know
nothing
that
would
change
that
and
--
mr.
henry
f.
field
if
the
court
would
leave.
mr.
henry
f.
field
well,
were
he
a
millionaire,
i
could
conceive
how
it
could
be
irrelevant
because
of
the
method
that
illinois
has
chosen
to
completely
deny
transcripts
to
indigents
in
nine
to
six
months
cases.
mr.
henry
f.
field
yes,
i
think
it,
well
--
mr.
henry
f.
field
well,
i
think
this
case
of-course
is
important
and
his
ability
to
pay
now
might
indeed
change
the
court's
whole
posture
on
the
situation.
however,
this
court
has
a
record
before
it
which
i
believe
is
complete
and
illinois
by
hesitating
can
frustrate
this
court's
enforcement
of
fourteenth
amendment
by
--
as
it
has
in
this
case,
forcing
defendants
to
appeal
and
because
time
is
always
money,
raise
in
any
indigent
case
a
question
as
to
it
his
ability
to
pay
for
a
transcript.
mr.
henry
f.
field
that
is
true.
mr.
henry
f.
field
frankly,
your
honor
i
am
not
certain
what
a
physician
is
since
he
has
to
my
understanding
graduated.
mr.
henry
f.
field
this
i
believe
it
was
a
summer
and
he
is
been
working
in
a
hospital
for
several
months.
mr.
henry
f.
field
yes.
i
suppose
that
is
correct.
mr.
henry
f.
field
i
do
not
know
what
he
is
getting.
i
have
no
knowledge
of
it.
mr.
henry
f.
field
no.
he
is
only
been
working
very,
very
briefly.
basically
what
happened
was
that
this
defendant
was
a
participant
as
a
medical
apprentice
while
he
was
in
the
medical
school,
first
aid
assistance
at
the
scene
of
a
demonstration
in
chicago,
march
and
rally,
which
was
sponsored
by
sts
and
various
other
anti
war
at
that
time
groups
and
he
came
upon
a
injured
victim
and
interacted
with
the
police
under
circumstances
which
were
the
subject
of
a
two-day
jury
trial.
mr.
henry
f.
field
well,
that
of
course
is
the
transcript
which
is
not
present
in
the
case
and
what
happened
--
mr.
henry
f.
field
he
is
charged
with
two
city
chicago
municipal
offenses.
mr.
henry
f.
field
disorderly
conduct
and
interfering
with
the
police
and
he
was
sentenced
to
$500
and
i
represented
this
defendant
at
trial.
after
the
trial
--
mr.
henry
f.
field
no
jail,
no
jail
was
possible
except
as
we
discussed
extensively.
mr.
henry
f.
field
after
the
trial
he
filed
a
post
trial
motion
which
raised
several
substantial
contentions,
attacking
the
legitimacy
of
the
verdict
and
a
judgment
of
a
case.
his
basic
point
was
that
he
has
convicted
on
insufficient
evidence
compounded
of
grossly
prejudicial
prosecutorial
misconduct,
he
was
denied
in
the
fair
trial
and
the
cumulative
effect
was
to
override,
wholly
override
the
evidence
in
the
case.
as
stated
in
affidavit
of
counsel
at
the
--
in
the
post
trial
motion
and
before
the
--
and
the
motion
in
illinois
supreme
court,
it
was
our
feeling
that
the
defendant
was
convicted
not
for
what
he
did,
but
for
sins
of
sts
and
for
unreal
--
wholly
unrelated,
but
contemporaneous
injury
to
one
richard
elroy
(ph)
who
vaulted,
who
was
them
an
obscure
city
lawyer
in
a
prosecutor's
office
and
vaulted
in
the
front
page
of
chicago
papers
all
during
the
preliminary
portion
this
trial
and
the
time
between
his
arrest
and
trial
and
proceeded
from
the
front
pages
of
chicago
papers
to
elective
officers,
now
sheriff
of
cook
county.
after
this
motion
was
denied
and
we
learned
the
cost
of
a
transcript
is
well
beyond
his
means,
we
moved
in
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county
for
three
things,
appointment
of
counsel,
production
of
a
transcript
and
a
waiver
filing
fees.
after
lengthy
hearing
this,
the
court
found
that
he
was
indigent
and
unable
to
pay,
but
refused
to
grant
him
access
to
the
transcript
on
ground
that
rule
607
applies
only
to
felony
cases.
the
order
is
--
order
that
the
motion
of
a
defendant
for
relief
proceed
as
poor
person.
he
and
it's
hereby
denied
on
the
grounds
that
defendant
was
found
guilty
of
ordinance
violations
and
that
rule
607
of
the
supreme
court
applies
to
felony
cases.
we
renewed
the
motion
in
the
illinois
supreme
court
and
urged
the
unconstitutionality,
the
approach
taken
by
illinois
rule
607.
the
motion,
after
due
consideration,
for
counsel
and
transcript
was
denied
and
filing
fees
were
waived.
mr.
henry
f.
field
yes,
that
is
provided
in
other
sections
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
rules
and
there
are
two
basic
methods
for
proceeding.
the
first
method
is
to
get
an
agreed
statement
and
the
second
method
is
to
get
a
--
if
you
cannot
agree
to
get
a
settled
statement,
agree
with
the
prosecution
and
i
suppose
the
court.
mr.
henry
f.
field
neither
method
was
pursued
in
this
case
and
the
reason
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
contention
here.
it
is
the
position
of
the
defendant
and
appellant
here
that
very
clearly
on
the
face
of
his
contentions,
neither
alternatives
are
adequate,
neither
alternatives
adequate.
the
two
contentions;
one
of
insufficiency
in
the
evidence
and
one
of
grossly
prejudicial
misconduct,
both
require
the
kind
of
detailed
survey
of
the
facts
of
the
case.
the
words
used,
the
question
supposed,
the
answers
and
responses
which
only
a
transcript
could
provide
and
which
no
one
connected
to
the
case,
having
total
recall,
could
possibly
reconstruct.
mr.
henry
f.
field
my
best
recollection
is
it
was
two
days,
but
there
was
possibly
some
spill
over
to
a
third
day
for
--
mr.
henry
f.
field
there
would
be
no
way
to
adequately
present
an
appeal
on
these
contentions
in
that
circumstance.
mr.
henry
f.
field
well,
if
there
were
scribes
at
trial
or
to
people
helping
attorneys
who
could
take
down
the
detailed
testimony
that
could
have
not
been
true,
but
in
this
case
the
problem
was
that
he
was
poor
and
he
had
only
his
counsel
and—
mr.
henry
f.
field
that
maybe
possible
i
think
in
most
cases,
but
that
not
certainly
not
the
case
here
because
the
nature
--
mr.
henry
f.
field
no,
i
did
not
take
care
for
notes.
i
took
some
notes
and
i
--
but
i
was
conducting
the
cross
examination
and
i
knew
that
the
transcript
was
either
reporter
was
present
and
that
--
mr.
henry
f.
field
no.
there
was
no
one
from
the
case
and
i
think
that
the
nature
of
the
contention,
the
key
to
why
a
transcript
is
required
to
this
case
because
the
contention
on
introduction
of
the
evidence
was
that
the
police,
some
certain
police
testimony
which
the
purport
of
which
was
to
show
this
man,
the
defendant
to
be
violent
man,
was
inherently
incredible
and
was
demonstrated
to
be
such
by
other
testimony
at
the
trial
and
by
the
cross
examination
by
myself,
lengthy
cross
examination
of
the
police
witnesses.
mr.
henry
f.
field
that
is
absolutely
true
as
to
this
two
contentions,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
f.
field
i
could
do,
i
could
make
synopsis
of
much
of
the
testimony.
there
is
no
doubt
that
i
can
recall
a
great
deal
that
went
on,
but
there
is
no
way
that
i
can
recall
the
kind
detailed
questioning
and
the
words
used
that
precise
words
used
that
go
to
show
the
nature
of
the
prejudicial
attack
of
the
prosecutor
as
intensive
systematic
effort
to
hang
this
defendant,
not
for
the
facts
of
what
happened
with
his
interaction
with
the
police,
but
for
--
on
wholly
related
matters
and
sins
of
others
and
injury
to
mr.
richard
elroy
which
was
the
really
prime
focus
of
the
persecution.
i
believe
that
i
can
show
that
with
a
transcript.
i
could
that
the
first
witness
in
the
case
is
put
on
solely
for
the
reason
of
interjecting
into
this
trial,
the
name,
well
known
to
everyone
of
richard
elroy.
mr.
henry
f.
field
richard
elroy
is
now
the
sheriff
of
cook
county.
mr.
henry
f.
field
at
the
time
of
incident
here,
out
of
which
this
case
arises,
he
was
an
obscure
city
lawyer
in
the
corporation
counsel’s
office,
a
prosecutor
for
the
city
of
chicago.
that
he
was
--
this
appears
from
the
affidavit,
these
facts
appear
on
affidavit
of
counsel
in
brief
at
12.
he
vaulted
from
obscurity
into
the
front
pages
and
into
elective
office
on
the
basis
of
his
injury
which
occurred
during
this
same
anti
war
demonstration.
two
rules
of
illinois
law
also
combine
to
make
overwhelming
the
impossibility
of
this
defendant
reconstructing
the
nature,
the
words
used,
inadequate,
a
minimally
adequate
factual
predicate
for
presenting
these
two
contentions.
first
of
all
under
illinois
law
the
defendant,
if
there
is
any
disagreement
as
to
the
facts,
must
prove
desperation
of
the
facts.
at
a
hearing
on
effect
under
rule,
illinois
supreme
court
rule
323,
i
believe
which
is
a
settled
statement
rule
and
in
this
situation
there
is
no
way
that
i
could
or
anyone
could
prove
the
detailed
and
intensive
prejudicial
conduct
of
the
prosecutor.
the
words
used,
how
could
i
prove,
how
could
anyone
prove
something
they
cannot
recall?
the
second
rule
of
law
creating
a
hurdle
to
an
adequate
review,
inadequate
alternative
is
that
the
appellate
courts
of
illinois
presumed
the
facts
against
the
defendant,
if
inadequate
record
is
not
provided
for
at
least
to
support
the
contentions
on
appeal
and
there
is
no
way
that
this
defendant
can
create
minimally
adequate
factual
predicate
for
these
two
contentions.
he
could
create
to
settled
and
agreed
statement
on
many
other
facts
in
the
case
but
there
is
now
way
he
can
proceed.
mr.
henry
f.
field
no
i
do
not
argue
that
your
honor
in
this
case.
mr.
henry
f.
field
that
point
is
made
by
the
state
attorney
in
capacity
as
amicus
and
i
think
the
answer
to
that
there
has
to
be
a
clear
recognition
that
based
on
the
affidavit
and
others
facts
of
record
--
mr.
henry
f.
field
they
may
got
a
very
clear
case.
mr.
henry
f.
field
that
they
show,
they
demonstrate.
mr.
henry
f.
field
that
is
my
position.
i
would
change
the
words
slightly.
they
demonstrate
that
is
impossible
for
--
that
this
was
impossible
for
this
defendant
to
proceed
without
being
caught
in
that
fine
of
either
submitting
a
settled
or
agreed
statement
which
was
he
knew
to
be
wholly
inadequate
which
could
not
start
to
create
the
minimum
factual
predicate
for
these
two
points
and
if
it
is
agreed
upon,
if
the
prosecutor
and
if
i
where
the
prosecutor
i
would
think
it
very
smart
to
agree
to
the
statement,
knowing
full
well
that's
inadequate.
what
if
he
creates
--
leaves
--
mr.
henry
f.
field
well,
i
have
to
--
the
counsel
and
the
defendant
have
to
create
the
factual
statement
and
there
is
no
way
without
total
recall
that
i
can
demonstrate
and
create
a
factual
record
on
these
two
points.
they
require
close
attention
to
the
words
used
and
the
questions
posed
on
cross
examination
and
direct
examination
--
mr.
henry
f.
field
pardon,
mr.
justice
brennan?
mr.
henry
f.
field
no.
mr.
henry
f.
field
well,
we
had
the
hearing
and
the
denial
in
the
circuit
court
and
then
in
the
supreme
court.
mr.
henry
f.
field
i
do
not
have
a
transcript
and
i
frankly
have
forgotten
what
i
argued,
but
i
was
totally
foreclosed
from
seeking
of
transcript
because
of
the
judge's
legal
ruling
that
i
could
not
regardless
of
my
need
for
it
and
the
nature
of
contentions
that
were
raised,
get
one
under
rule
607.
mr.
henry
f.
field
because
the
rule
applied
only
to
felony
cases.
mr.
henry
f.
field
no.
this
was
submitted
on
papers.
mr.
henry
f.
field
yes,
in
the
supreme
court,
this
was
--
in
illinois
supreme
court
this
was
fully
briefed,
this
point
and
demonstrated
why.
mr.
henry
f.
field
oh!
yes.
this
was
and
in
fact
the
--
except
from
the
affidavit
of
counsel
appears
in
the
brief,
as
to
why
it
is
impossible.
mr.
henry
f.
field
i
believe
so
your
honor,
that
the
course
of
trial
as
to
the
prejudicial
conduct
of
prosecution
was
denied
in
fair
trial.
the
course
of
trial
was,
has
to
be
examined.
illinois
requires
that
in
order
to
judge
the
impact
of
a
prejudicial
conduct
or
large,
you
must
survey
the
whole
record.
there
is
now
way
that
i
could
or
anyone
could
reconstruct
the
record,
although
they
could
as
you
point
out
reconstruct
many
things
in
the
record.
there
is
no
way
that
he
can
reconstruct
this
point
and
the
point
of
insufficiency
of
evidence
inherent
from
credibility
of
certain
police
testimony
which
would
permit
him
to
be
acquitted
on
appeal.
mr.
henry
f.
field
i
think
that
williams
versus
oklahoma
city
indicates
that
wherever
an
appeal
is
granted
to
all
defendants
that
the
appeal
may
not
be
denied
in
effect
poor
defendants
because
of
inability
to
buy
a
transcript.
now,
of
course
your
hypothetical
doesn't,
isn't
this
case.
mr.
henry
f.
field
yes,
i
realize
that.
mr.
henry
f.
field
yes,
i
think
that
you
have
to
examine
the
real
life
impact
on
the
defendant
in
a
particular
case
and
at
some
point
the
question
your
--
the
point
your
question
raises
is
that
at
some
point
certain
offenses
are
so
trivial
and
unimportant
that
even
the
fourteenth
amendment
should
not
be
applied
to
require
a
transcript
and
that
i
would
not
be
able
say
hypothetically
without
an
examination
of
a
real
case
and
i
just
want
sit
on
that
case
and
listen
to
the
--
mr.
henry
f.
field
no,
i
definitely
would
not
your
honor.
i
think
that
this
case
demonstrates
the
crudity
and
injustice
of
that
rule,
that
is
--
mr.
henry
f.
field
i
think
that
i
would
look
at
the
realities
of
the
detriment.
that
is
if
it
is
a
fishing
license
case,
take
a
hypothetical,
it
might
well
be
that
fishing
license
--
fishing
without
a
license
in
a
certain
area
of
the
world
is
the
next
heinous,
most
heinous
sin
to
murder
and
in
that
situation
i
would
think
that
a
transcript
would
be
required
although
a
small
fine
perhaps
was
involved.
i
would
look
at
the
particular
impact
on
a
particular
defendant
in
cases
that
arise.
mr.
henry
f.
field
yes.
mr.
henry
f.
field
yes.
mr.
henry
f.
field
yes.
the
appendix
to
the
reply
brief
does
have
a
brief
synopsis
of
what
i
believe
to
be
the
situation
in
regard
to
reporting
of
trial
generally.
mr.
henry
f.
field
yes,
no
throughout
country,
at
least
in
the
states
we
surveyed.
it
is
my
understanding
that
in
many
jurisdictions
there
are
no
--
there
is
no
stenographicaly
transcribed
--
mr.
henry
f.
field
--
at
trial,
but
in
those
jurisdictions
you
have
de
novo
review
the
circuit
court
and
the
court
of
general
jurisdiction
where
you
can
be
retried
and
universally
in
those
cases,
there
is
stenographic
--
mr.
henry
f.
field
well,
if
you
had
a
trial
de
novo
--
mr.
henry
f.
field
you
get
a
transcript
and
i
do
not
think
that
there
would
be
a
problem.
mr.
henry
f.
field
the
important
thing
in
examining
the
impact
on
this
defendant
here
is
an
alternative
if
that
he
needs
to
wipe
his
slate
clean
and
as
the
briefs
examined
his
future
and
i
believe
that
is
real
mistake.
mr.
henry
f.
field
thank
you.
