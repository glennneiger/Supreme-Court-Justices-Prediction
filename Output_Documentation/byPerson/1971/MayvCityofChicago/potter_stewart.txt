he
interacted
with
the
police,
for
that's
a
(inaudible)
what?
what
did
he
--
what
happened?
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
he
charged
with?
justice
potter
stewart
like
the
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
the
$500
fine
and
no
imprisonment?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
who
is
richard
elroy?
justice
potter
stewart
oh!
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
i
did
not
understand
that
the
claim
in
these
cases
unrelated
to
a
particular
arise
need
in
this
case.
as
i
understood
the
petitioner,
his
claim
is
that
because
of
the
two
claimed
endeavors
in
this
case,
sufficiently
of
the
evidence,
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
in
prosecutorial
misconduct.
this
happens
to
be
one
of
those
rare
cases
if
you
will
where
a
settled
statement
of
the
facts
would
be
inadequate.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
i
did
not
realize
there
were
claims
about
the
instructions
to
the
jury.
i
thought
the
questions
were
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
in
prosecutorial
misconduct.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
i
further
understood
appellate's
basic
claim
to
be
that
while
in
perhaps
ninety-nine-and-half
percent
of
the
cases
of
this
type
an
adequate
and
fair
view
could
be
had
on
a
agreed
statement
of
facts
or
a
settled
statement.
there
do
exist
some
rare
cases
where
that
is
insufficient
and
therefore
the
rule
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
which
just
is
a
blanket
rule
thing
that
in
no
case
can
there
be
a
transcript
that
that
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it's
a
little
bit
analogous
to
a
case
we
have
that
term
groppi
against
wisconsin,
involving
a
rule
of
wisconsin
law
that
it
said,
that
in
no
misdemeanor
case,
in
no
misdemeanor
case
could
there
ever
be
a
change
of
venue
and
the
claim
was
made
that
in
999
out
of
a
1000
or
perhaps
more
misdemeanor
cases
there
would
not
need
to
be
a
change
of
venue
in
order
to
a
court
for
fair
trial.
but
there
could
the
rare
case
where
only
a
change
of
venue
could
satisfy
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
provide
a
fair
trial
and
that
as
i
understood,
it
was
the
appellant,
the
petitioner’s
claim
here.
he
is
attacking
the
blanket
rule
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois.
justice
potter
stewart
do
i
understand
this
to
be
his
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
understand
the
state
than
i
do?
justice
potter
stewart
i
was
--
maybe
i
am
overstating
the
argument
on
this
case's
argument,
that
is
what
i
understood?
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
his
affidavit
a
part
of
which
appears
on
the
petitioners
brief
on
page
12
that
was
brought
before
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
was
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
no.
i
am
on
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
brief
for
the
appellant
on
page
12,
petitioner's
appeal,
the
appellant
on
page
12.
is
it
not
that
part
of
an
affidavit
that
was
submitted
to
the
supreme
court
of
illinois?
justice
potter
stewart
so
far
as
that?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
were
they
having
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
do
not
suppose
most
prosecutors
would
agree
that
they
engaged
in
misconduct.
justice
potter
stewart
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
you
would
--
i
would
for
a
moment
as
i
understand
the
colloquy
you
indicated
that
this
rule
does
not
mean
what
it
says?
justice
potter
stewart
in
what?
justice
potter
stewart
what
authority
you
got
that
say
that
the
rule
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
did
not
mean
what
it
seems
to
say?
justice
potter
stewart
yes
and
do
you
know
of
any
case
where
--?
justice
potter
stewart
or
if
you
got
any
direction
or
authority
from
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
to
make
this
representation?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then,
in
other
words,
you
are
saying
that
rule
as
written
is
unconstitutional?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
thought
you
said
that
under
the
williams
against
oklahoma
if
the
rule
as
written
is
unconstitutional
that
if
there
is
a
showing
that
anything
short
of
a
written
transcript
of
the
evidence
will
not
give
a
meaningful
appeal
than
there
has
to
be
a
written
transcript
and
this
rule
as
written
doesn't
provide
for
that.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
the
rule
does
not
make
any
exception
for
a
written
transcript
or
there
is
any
such
showing,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
rule
is
unconstitutional
as
i
understand.
justice
potter
stewart
what
sort
of
case
would
you
hypotheticate
that
would
be
such
a
case?
justice
potter
stewart
you
do
not
think
there
is
any
such
case?
justice
potter
stewart
there
could
be?
justice
potter
stewart
and
under
the
distinction
in
illinois
between
petty
and
serious
is
offenses
for
which
you
can
go
to
prison
and
those
for
which
you
cannot?
justice
potter
stewart
up
to
six
months?
justice
potter
stewart
same
as
the
federal
rule?
justice
potter
stewart
he
interacted
with
the
police,
for
that's
a
(inaudible)
what?
what
did
he

what
happened?
justice
potter
stewart
what
was

who
