mr.
richard
l.
curry
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issues
as
the
city
of
chicago
sees
them
in
this
case
are
two.
first,
should
rule
of
griffin
versus
illinois
and
williams
versus
oklahoma
city
be
extended
to
afford
free
transcripts
to
indigent
for
appealing
cases
involving
convictions
of
what
are
generally
recognized
as
merely
of
petty
offenses
and
secondly,
does
the
classification
between
serious
and
petty
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
a
fashion
which
this
court
has
considered
in
the
past
in
another
cases
to
be
invidious.
we
believe
that
both
these
questions
ought
to
be
answer
in
the
negative.
this
court
in
boddie
versus
connecticut
has
recently
noted
that
griffin
rule
has
had
a
sturdy
growth
and
i
submit
that
the
growth
was
noticed
greatly
by
the
fact
that
each
subsequent
application
of
the
rule
in
griffin
has
been
based
upon
a
fact
situation
which
found;
one,
personal
liberty
of
the
petitioner
in
jeopardy
and
or
upon
two;
the
invidious
exclusionary
consequences
of
the
particular
appellate
practice
as
it
was
applied
to
an
indigent.
neither
of
these
threshold
conditions
exists
in
this
case.
appellant
here
is
not
faced
with
the
prospect
of
incarceration
because
he
was
charged
with
an
ordinance
violation
for
which
the
only
sanction
was
a
fine.
and
secondly
the
appellant
himself
has
cavalierly
ignored
alternate
available
avenues
to
perfect
his
appeal.
mayer's
illinois
supreme
court
appeal
of
the
lower
court
jury
conviction
has
been
docketed
and
is
awaiting
to
disposition
of
this
question
in
this
court.
he
is
not
therefore
in
the
posture
of
williams
versus
oklahoma
city
and
your
decision
in
that
case
ought
not
to
be
considered
as
controlling.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
it
is
in
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
just
--
mr.
richard
l.
curry
it
is
hoped
quite
frankly
your
honor,
that
the
verdict
in
this
case
will
require
that
mr.
field
use
his
considerable
talent
as
was
exhibited
in
his
post
trial
motion
of
14
pages
and
reconstruct
a
settled
statement
so
that
the
matter
can
be
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court
as
i
hope
an
expectation
that
the
rule
of
griffin
will
not
be
expanded
by
this
bench.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
yes,
sir.
it
requires
agreement
similar
to
the
agreement
i
submit
that
are
necessary
to
have
instructions
to
a
jury.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
it
is
a
binding
instruction
i
submit.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
the
judge
would
settle
the
disagreement
between
the
parties
in
a
settled
statement
under
the
rules
of
illinois.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
that
would
have
to
be
done
in
order
to
go
forward
with
the
illinois
supreme
court
of
appeal.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
this
trial
was
october
11,
1969.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
the
transcript
is
not
available
in
this
case
and
there
in
the
(voice
overlap)
mr.
richard
l.
curry
i
really
do
not
know
that
your
honor.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
i
was
going
suggest,
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
that
avenue
of
reviewing
the
un-transcribed
portion
of
the
reporter’s
notes
is
also
an
avenue
which
is
available
to
the
appellant
in
this
case.
i
direct
your
attention
to
the
--
mr.
richard
l.
curry
i
submit
that
it
would
be
his
obligation
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
he
had
tried
that
and
that
avenue
was
not
available,
that
he
was
in
fact
affectively
foreclosed
from
the
reasonable
avenues
to
go
forward
with
his
matter
and
try
to
present
an
alternative
to
the
court.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
the
rule
of
the
court
spoken
in
terms
of
a
felony
at
that
time
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
you
are
right
at
the
lower
level
your
honor.
he
do
not
want
to
--
mr.
richard
l.
curry
he
then
went
to
the
supreme
court
the
--
mr.
richard
l.
curry
i
think
he
was
correct
with
his
ruling.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
i
do
sir.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
no,
not
because
he
ruled
because
there
is
in
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
ruled
three
to
agree,
clear
and
unmistakable
a
language
which
finds
that
as
a
derivation
of
the
case
of
duncan
versus
louisiana
where
alternates
are
specifically
suggested
as
ways
that
a
state
can
allow
an
indigent
to
proceed
other
than
by
a
full
verbatim
transcript.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
the
circuit
judge
denied
his
motion
for
a
free
transcript,
you
are
right,
on
the
basis
i
submit
though
your
honor
that
an
extensive
post
trial
motion
running
14
pages
here
indicating
the
depth
of
perception
that
mr.
field
exhibited
at
that
time.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
i
submit
your
honor
that
it's
my
contention
that
at
the
lower
level
it
was
one
question
that
is
he
indigent
and
the
court
found
at
the
lower
level
that
he
was
not
qualified
to
apply
for
a
free
transcript
under
the
rule
because
he
wasn't
a
felony.
when
this
question
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
illinois
supreme
court,
the
illinois
supreme
court
your
honor
found
that
for
the
purposes
of
fees
and
filing
fees
they
would
waive
because
the
expenses
of
the
administrator
of
the
court
clerks,
they
are
for
the
state
to
incur,
but
the
state
supreme
court
in
my
interpretation
of
what
they
have
done
has
said
we
ought
not
in
this
case
provide
at
the
expense
of
the
state
of
illinois
a
transcript
when
the
petitioner
has
not
shown
any
attempt
to
avail
himself
of
the
other
alternatives
available.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
we
say
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
not
in
the
posture
of
williams
versus
oklahoma
city
and
your
decision
in
that
case
ought
not
to
be
controlling
because
williams
was
locked
out
of
his
supreme
court
by
reason
of
the
unavailability
of
a
verbatim
transcript
and
had
faced
a
90-day
jail
sentence.
in
that
case
the
trial
court
made
specific
findings
that
williams
argument
had
merits,
that
his
appeal
could
not
be
properly
prepared
without
a
transcript,
that
neither
williams
nor
his
attorney
could
make
up
an
inadequate
record
from
memory,
that
the
transcript
was
in
fact
in
existence
and
available.
none
of
these
condition
exists
in
the
present
case,
although
a
complete
verbatim
transcript
has
been
denied,
mayer
makes
no
attempt
whatsoever
to
avail
himself
of
the
alternate
methods
available
to
present
a
record
to
the
illinois
supreme
court.
the
illinois
supreme
court
rule
323
(c)
and
(d)
is
in
clear
and
unmistakable
harmony
with
this
court’s
observations
in
draper
versus
washington.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
i
would
believe
he
would
not
be
foreclosed
to
making
that
point.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
i
believe
that
would
be
the
--
mr.
richard
l.
curry
the
language
is
now
been
reduced
your
honor
to
90-days,
though
the
change
is
not
to
remain
to
this
case.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
i
believe
they
would
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
because
i
believe
justice
white
-
mr.
richard
l.
curry
i
believe
illinois
would
be
influenced
greatly
by
the
--
what
transpired
in
william
versus
oklahoma
and
be
very
cautious
your
honor
to
see
the
doors
to
the
appellate
court
--
mr.
richard
l.
curry
--
were
not
foreclosed.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
i
certainly
do
believe
that.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
certainly.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
exactly.
the
rule
is
not
an
absolute
and
to
the
extent
that
the
supreme
court
then
would
be
in
an
impossible
position
that
it
would
recognize
that
a
meaningful
appeal
could
not
be
brought,
but
its
hands
would
then
be
effectively
tied
to
allow
such
an
appeal
to
come
forward.
i
do
not
believe
that's
a
tenable
situation.
i
don't
think
illinois
supreme
court
would
so
interpret
their
own
rule.
petitioner
here,
i
submit,
rejects
out
of
hand
what
draper
suggests
and
it
is
not
a
hand
to
help
the
court
understand
why
the
alternative
courses
are
found
wanting?
instead
he
asks
this
court
to
expand
griffin
beyond
the
clear
and
meaningful
limit
to
that
rule
and
its
successors
beyond
the
bounds
of
logic
and
beyond
what
i
submit
to
be
the
capabilities
of
the
appellate
processes
as
in
illinois
and
perhaps
throughout
the
nation.
the
troubled
journey
which
griffin
and
its
successors
seek
to
alleviate
for
the
indigent
criminal
defendant
as
he
struggles
to
maintain
his
liberty
cannot
abide,
i
submit,
his
purpose
for
meandering
off
the
path.
the
record
must
clearly
disclose
the
inadequacies
or
unavailability
of
multiple
remedies.
appellate
makes
no
attempt
in
this
regard
and
i
submit
that
counsel
errs
in
his
brief
at
page
37
when
he
suggests
that
california
requires
no
such
showing.
the
california
rule
as
to
a
free
transcript
in
misdemeanor
cases
is
set
forth
in
the
1970
case
of
joe
z.
versus
superior
court
reported
at
3
california
3rd,
page
54.
when
the
court
in
that
case
held
that
before
an
indigent
misdemeanor
is
entitled
to
a
free
transcript
on
appeal,
he
must
first
attempt
to
reach
an
agreement
upon
a
settled
statement.
the
transcript
would
be
provided
only
of
the
parties
cannot
agree
or
for
settle
statement
would
be
inadequate.
the
misdemeanor
then
court
quotes,
“must
show
in
a
reasonably
particularized
presentation
the
reason
why
he
cannot
inform
the
reviewing
court
by
a
settled
statement
of
the
claimed
inadequacies
and
error.”
i
submit
to
you
it
is
impossible
to
determine
whether
the
parties
cannot
agree
or
whether
a
settled
statement
would
be
inadequate
unless
there
has
first
been
a
real
attempt
at
an
agreement.
it
is
the
burden
of
indigency
that
the
cases
seek
to
relieve.
mayer
in
this
case
would
champion
that
cause
into
a
calculated
disregard
for
alternate
methods
of
presenting
an
appeal
which
this
court
has
previously
approved
of
them
both
griffin
and
draper
and
which
the
illinois
supreme
court
has
by
rule
subsequently
adopted.
if
a
full
stenographer's
transcript
must
be
produced
as
matter
of
right
or
as
a
matter
of
simple
preference
unrelated
to
cost,
unrelated
to
convenience
or
necessity
or
even
unrelated
to
rule
of
court
then
the
alternatives
to
the
extravagance
suggested
in
draper
must
be
overruled.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
these
two
points
were
brought
to
the
illinois
supreme
court
--
mr.
richard
l.
curry
--
on
motion
not
on
brief
your
honor
and
the
extensive
fashion
in
which
they
were
discussed
in
brief
in
this
court
was
not,
i
submit,
brought
to
the
attention
to
the
court
to
that
extent.
the
alleged
prosecutorial
error
and
prejudicial
treatment
in
the
manner
that
charges
to
the
jury
were
given
in
the
broadest
terms,
in
the
same
terms
at
least
raise
them
in
this
court.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
right
and
they
are
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
but
he
has
never
tried
--
mr.
richard
l.
curry
i
believe
that
he
overstated
--
mr.
richard
l.
curry
he
is
overstating
his
argument.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
no,
sir,
justice
stewart.
the
point
--
the
point
that
i
think
is
important
and
i
think
the
meaningful
reasons
for
the
alternatives
in
the
us
--
in
the
illinois
supreme
court
rule
is
that
it
is
incumbent
upon
those
to
whom
a
transcript
is
not
available
either
because
of
their
indigency
or
because
of
their
unwillingness
to
pay
for
it
from
their
own
funds,
it
is
incumbent
upon
them
before
they
ask
the
state
to
show
the
illinois
supreme
court
why
they
cannot
bring
the
record
to
the
court
in
one
of
these
alternate
fashions.
he
did
not
do
this
in
this
case
and
--
mr.
richard
l.
curry
i
am
lost,
i
am
in
the
abstract,
the
us
abstract.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
sorry.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
i
believe
it
was,
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
but
it
is
conclusionary
in
--
mr.
richard
l.
curry
i
would
have
him
point
out,
would
have
inquired
of
the
prosecutor
as
the
prosecutor’s
willingness
to
be
engaged
in
a
settlement,
a
possible
settled
statement
before
the
court.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
i
do
not
suppose
they
would
but
i
believe
your
honor
that
we
should
have
an
hearing
of
that
issue
for
the
benefit
of
the
rule
so
that
the
supreme
court
would
know
that
its
rule
was
not
flagrantly
been
disregarded,
but
there
was
an
attempt
to
adhere
to
the
rule.
if
he
was
able
come
forward
and
say
that
the
prosecutor
who
handle
this
case
was
unavailable
or
unwilling
participate
in
a
negotiated
settlement
i
would
say
that
would
be
meaningful
information
for
illinois
supreme
court
to
hear.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
if
he
said
that
he
had
gone
to
the
trial
judge
and
asked
the
trial
judge
what
his
minutes
book
showed
as
to
notes
of
what
his
recollection
was
i
would
say
that
those
would
be
meaningful
comments
that
the
illinois
supreme
court
would
utilize
in
determining
then
the
appropriateness
or
the
true
meaningfulness
of
his
application
for
a
free
transcript,
that
he
really
would
not
be
before
them
in
any
meaningful
fashion
unless
he
was
able
to
have
one
or
the
other.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
persecutor
would
be
able
to
foreclose
the
appeal
by
denying.
if
the
prosecutor
denied
it
then
i
think
the
illinois
supreme
court
would
remedy
that
by
granting
him
the
free
transcript.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
i
mean
it
is
not
as
absolute
as
it's
read.
i
mean
that
in
the
application
of
the
rule
the
court
would
clearly
require
an
exhaustion
first
of
alternates
and
then
recognize
that
the
mere
filing
would
not
give
the
person
present
before
them.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
it
would
be
important
before
--
mr.
richard
l.
curry
the
authority
would
be
on
the
basis
of
that
court’s
close
attention
to
the
language
of
this
court’s
decision
in
griffin
and
--
mr.
richard
l.
curry
no,
sir
there
is
no
case
that
i
know
of.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
no,
i
have
none
at
the
illinois
supreme
court
level
justice
stewart.
what
i
know
clearly
though
is
that
at
the
lower
level,
in
the
trial
level
there
are
number
of
instances
where
despite
the
fact
that
there
are
alternatives
available
and
despite
the
fact
the
rule
calls
for
no
transcripts
over
90
days
that
the
trial
level
in
many
instances
in
my
experience
as
corporation
counsel
does
grant
a
transcript
to
the
indigent.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
it
is
utilized
as
a
matter
of
discretion
and
not
brought
into
challenge
by
in
any
case
that
i
am
aware
of
in
illinois.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
i
really
believe
that
the
weight
and
the
import
of
the
williams
case
would
be
so
profound
on
the
illinois
supreme
court
to
justify
belief
that
they
would
effectively
render
this
petitioner's
appeal
meaningless
by
denying
him
all
avenues
if
he
were
to
effectively
show
them
that
the
two
alternatives
that
they
suggest
are
meaningless
than
i
do
believe
that
they
would
remedy
the
incongruity
that
exists
there
and
require
a
free
transcript
be
provided.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
i
do
not
believe
i
am
saying
that
at
all
sir.
i
am
obviously
reading
into
it
more
than
the
usual
language
is
there,
but
i
do
not
believe
the
rule
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
there
has
to
be
such
showing.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
i
submit
that
there
is
nothing
like
that
in
the
state.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
it
does
not
sir.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
the
rules
follows
very
closely
the
language
in
duncan
where
alternatives
were
suggested
by
this
court
as
the
means
that
the
state
may
utilize
to
avoid
the
impact
of
extravagance,
frivolous
appeal
to
what
have
you?
i
submit
that
in
following
that
logic
the
court
clearly
wrestled
with
the
subject
and
has
a
rule
which
is
not
keeping
with
griffin
and
is
not
keeping
with
duncan
and
when
we
come
to
a
fact
situation
which
we
really
have
not
come
to
in
this
case
or
any
case
that
i
know
of
in
illinois
where
the
two
other
alternatives
are
shown
to
have
been
attempted
and
to
be
wanting
in
brining
a
meaningful
record
to
the
court.
we
haven't
come
to
the
case
where
then
the
illinois
supreme
court
would
deny.
i
do
believe
that
if
a
--
mr.
richard
l.
curry
pardon,
i
would
hypotheticate
that
there
would
never
be
such
a
case
in
illinois.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
i
do
not
believe
there
would
be,
sir.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
there
could
be
surely,
but
i
do
not
believe
there
would
be
for
simple
reason
that
the
purpose
of
the
rule
in
my
opinion
clearly
and
unmistakably
indicates
the
ruling
is
on
the
part
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
to
have
the
litigant
available
to
come
before
him
and
present
a
meaningful
record
of
what
transpired.
it
does
--
it
is
presents
alternatives
and
it
seems
to
me
that
when
have
early
say
i
do
not
want
alternative
b
and
i
do
not
i
want
alternative
c,
i
must
have
alternative
a
that
is
not
keeping
with
what
the
illinois
supreme
court
rule
has
in
mind.
if
you
took
away
the
first
two
problems
where
you
did
meet
that
issue
then
i
do
believe
that
in
illinois
a
free
transcript
would
be
forthcoming.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
prosecutor.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
one
of
the
errors
alleged
is
that
the
prosecutor
limped
in
the
courtroom.
the
prosecutor
was
although
injured
in
that
same
affair,
he
did
limp
in
the
courtroom
as
you
would
be
uncertain,
perfectly
willing
to
agree
that
he
limped
in
the
courtroom
that
day,
if
that
is
prosecutorial
error.
i
do
not
believe
it
is
but
i
know
--
mr.
richard
l.
curry
but
neither
--
mr.
richard
l.
curry
is
he
bound
by
them,
i
believe
that
it
would
be
very
similar,
the
negotiation
that
would
go
on
during
a
agreed
statement
or
a
settled
statement
would
be
very
similar
to
the
kind
of
negotiations
that
goes
on
when
lawyers
and
the
judges
get
together
over
instructions
to
the
jury.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
the
judge
will
resolve.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
that's
my
understanding.
he
would
have
available
to
him,
the
note,
the
minutes
note
that
he
made
as
you
said
there.
he
would
also
have
i
submit
available
to
him
the
participation
of
the
un-transcribed
notes
from
the
court
reporter
if
he
sought
them
and
thought
they
were
necessary.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
i
know
of
none.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
there
is
none.
there
is
no
showing
throughout
the
record
that
any
attempt
has
been
made
to
secure
an
agreed
statement.
i
take
issue
with
mr.
field's
statement
that
despite
two
days
of
trial
he
would
find
it
impossible
to
prepare
such
a
statement.
i
would
brought
your
attention
to
the
extensive
post
trial
notice
which
appears
in
your
abstract
at
page
11
through
22,
14
pages
i
might
add
of
in
depth
analysis
of
what
did
transpire
at
that
hearing.
i
submit
that
this
almost
in
itself
would
be
tantamount
to
a
record
made
under
either
one
of
these
proposals
by
the
illinois
supreme
court.
the
cases
since
griffin
give
the
support
of
the
kind
of
balance
that
judicial
propriety
found
in
duncan.
that
is
the
consequences
to
the
defendant
from
the
conviction
of
a
petty
offense
are
insufficient
to
what
were
the
benefits
to
efficient
law
enforcement
as
simplified
judicial
administration.
in
applying
fourteenth
amendment,
rinaldi
versus
yeager
says,
these
avenues
of
appeal
must
be
kept
free
of
unreasoned
distinctions.
i
believe
that
there
is
reason
distinction
in
the
illinois
supreme
court
rule.
the
distinction
being
between
petty
and
serious
and
i
believe
that
is
very
important
distinction
that
ought
to
be
respected
in
future
decision
by
the
court.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
six
months
is
the
distinction
made
by
the
illinois
supreme
court
rule,
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
right
same
as
the
federal
rule.
the
classification
would
fail
we're
told
in
shapiro
versus
thompson
unless
shown
to
be
necessary
to
promote
a
compelling
governmental
interest.
i
submit
to
you
that
a
compelling
elemental
interest
is
very
real
here
in
the
viability
of
the
court
systems
at
the
lower
level,
but
most
apparently
at
the
appellate
level,
if
appeals
on
full
transcripts
to
indigence
are
the
outgrowth
of
the
rule
of
this
case
and
finally
in
boddie
versus
connecticut
the
court
mentioning
the
absence
of
countervailing
state
interest
of
overriding
significance
and
classification
must
fail.
i
say
to
you
that
a
classification
such
as
we
have
here
between
serious
and
petty
is
a
countervailing
state
interest
of
overriding
significance.
i
would
respectfully
ask
this
court
to
reject
what's
urged
by
the
appellant
and
not
expand
the
rule
in
griffin
into
the
petty
offense
area.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
certainly.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
that
right.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
means
if
none
is
available
by
indigency,
means
if
none
is
available
by
--
mr.
richard
l.
curry
not
obtainable
in
this
case
because
he
cannot
pay
for
it,
i
submit
justice.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
none
that
i
know.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
thank
you.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issues
as
the
city
of
chicago
sees
them
in
this
case
are
two.
first,
should
rule
of
griffin
versus
illinois
and
williams
versus
oklahoma
city
be
extended
to
afford
free
transcripts
to
indigent
for
appealing
cases
involving
convictions
of
what
are
generally
recognized
as
merely
of
petty
offenses
and
secondly,
does
the
classification
between
serious
and
petty
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
a
fashion
which
this
court
has
considered
in
the
past
in
another
cases
to
be
invidious.
we
believe
that
both
these
questions
ought
to
be
answer
in
the
negative.
this
court
in
boddie
versus
connecticut
has
recently
noted
that
griffin
rule
has
had
a
sturdy
growth
and
i
submit
that
the
growth
was
noticed
greatly
by
the
fact
that
each
subsequent
application
of
the
rule
in
griffin
has
been
based
upon
a
fact
situation
which
found;
one,
personal
liberty
of
the
petitioner
in
jeopardy
and
or
upon
two;
the
invidious
exclusionary
consequences
of
the
particular
appellate
practice
as
it
was
applied
to
an
indigent.
neither
of
these
threshold
conditions
exists
in
this
case.
appellant
here
is
not
faced
with
the
prospect
of
incarceration
because
he
was
charged
with
an
ordinance
violation
for
which
the
only
sanction
was
a
fine.
and
secondly
the
appellant
himself
has
cavalierly
ignored
alternate
available
avenues
to
perfect
his
appeal.
mayer's
illinois
supreme
court
appeal
of
the
lower
court
jury
conviction
has
been
docketed
and
is
awaiting
to
disposition
of
this
question
in
this
court.
he
is
not
therefore
in
the
posture
of
williams
versus
oklahoma
city
and
your
decision
in
that
case
ought
not
to
be
considered
as
controlling.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
it
is
in
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
just
--
mr.
richard
l.
curry
it
is
hoped
quite
frankly
your
honor,
that
the
verdict
in
this
case
will
require
that
mr.
field
use
his
considerable
talent
as
was
exhibited
in
his
post
trial
motion
of
14
pages
and
reconstruct
a
settled
statement
so
that
the
matter
can
be
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court
as
i
hope
an
expectation
that
the
rule
of
griffin
will
not
be
expanded
by
this
bench.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
yes,
sir.
it
requires
agreement
similar
to
the
agreement
i
submit
that
are
necessary
to
have
instructions
to
a
jury.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
it
is
a
binding
instruction
i
submit.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
the
judge
would
settle
the
disagreement
between
the
parties
in
a
settled
statement
under
the
rules
of
illinois.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
that
would
have
to
be
done
in
order
to
go
forward
with
the
illinois
supreme
court
of
appeal.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
this
trial
was
october
11,
1969.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
the
transcript
is
not
available
in
this
case
and
there
in
the
(voice
overlap)
mr.
richard
l.
curry
i
really
do
not
know
that
your
honor.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
i
was
going
suggest,
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
that
avenue
of
reviewing
the
un-transcribed
portion
of
the
reporter’s
notes
is
also
an
avenue
which
is
available
to
the
appellant
in
this
case.
i
direct
your
attention
to
the
--
mr.
richard
l.
curry
i
submit
that
it
would
be
his
obligation
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
he
had
tried
that
and
that
avenue
was
not
available,
that
he
was
in
fact
affectively
foreclosed
from
the
reasonable
avenues
to
go
forward
with
his
matter
and
try
to
present
an
alternative
to
the
court.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
the
rule
of
the
court
spoken
in
terms
of
a
felony
at
that
time
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
you
are
right
at
the
lower
level
your
honor.
he
do
not
want
to
--
mr.
richard
l.
curry
he
then
went
to
the
supreme
court
the
--
mr.
richard
l.
curry
i
think
he
was
correct
with
his
ruling.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
i
do
sir.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
no,
not
because
he
ruled
because
there
is
in
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
ruled
three
to
agree,
clear
and
unmistakable
a
language
which
finds
that
as
a
derivation
of
the
case
of
duncan
versus
louisiana
where
alternates
are
specifically
suggested
as
ways
that
a
state
can
allow
an
indigent
to
proceed
other
than
by
a
full
verbatim
transcript.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
the
circuit
judge
denied
his
motion
for
a
free
transcript,
you
are
right,
on
the
basis
i
submit
though
your
honor
that
an
extensive
post
trial
motion
running
14
pages
here
indicating
the
depth
of
perception
that
mr.
field
exhibited
at
that
time.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
i
submit
your
honor
that
it's
my
contention
that
at
the
lower
level
it
was
one
question
that
is
he
indigent
and
the
court
found
at
the
lower
level
that
he
was
not
qualified
to
apply
for
a
free
transcript
under
the
rule
because
he
wasn't
a
felony.
when
this
question
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
illinois
supreme
court,
the
illinois
supreme
court
your
honor
found
that
for
the
purposes
of
fees
and
filing
fees
they
would
waive
because
the
expenses
of
the
administrator
of
the
court
clerks,
they
are
for
the
state
to
incur,
but
the
state
supreme
court
in
my
interpretation
of
what
they
have
done
has
said
we
ought
not
in
this
case
provide
at
the
expense
of
the
state
of
illinois
a
transcript
when
the
petitioner
has
not
shown
any
attempt
to
avail
himself
of
the
other
alternatives
available.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
we
say
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
not
in
the
posture
of
williams
versus
oklahoma
city
and
your
decision
in
that
case
ought
not
to
be
controlling
because
williams
was
locked
out
of
his
supreme
court
by
reason
of
the
unavailability
of
a
verbatim
transcript
and
had
faced
a
90-day
jail
sentence.
in
that
case
the
trial
court
made
specific
findings
that
williams
argument
had
merits,
that
his
appeal
could
not
be
properly
prepared
without
a
transcript,
that
neither
williams
nor
his
attorney
could
make
up
an
inadequate
record
from
memory,
that
the
transcript
was
in
fact
in
existence
and
available.
none
of
these
condition
exists
in
the
present
case,
although
a
complete
verbatim
transcript
has
been
denied,
mayer
makes
no
attempt
whatsoever
to
avail
himself
of
the
alternate
methods
available
to
present
a
record
to
the
illinois
supreme
court.
the
illinois
supreme
court
rule
323
(c)
and
(d)
is
in
clear
and
unmistakable
harmony
with
this
court’s
observations
in
draper
versus
washington.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
i
would
believe
he
would
not
be
foreclosed
to
making
that
point.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
i
believe
that
would
be
the
--
mr.
richard
l.
curry
the
language
is
now
been
reduced
your
honor
to
90-days,
though
the
change
is
not
to
remain
to
this
case.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
i
believe
they
would
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
because
i
believe
justice
white
-
mr.
richard
l.
curry
i
believe
illinois
would
be
influenced
greatly
by
the
--
what
transpired
in
william
versus
oklahoma
and
be
very
cautious
your
honor
to
see
the
doors
to
the
appellate
court
--
mr.
richard
l.
curry
--
were
not
foreclosed.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
i
certainly
do
believe
that.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
certainly.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
exactly.
the
rule
is
not
an
absolute
and
to
the
extent
that
the
supreme
court
then
would
be
in
an
impossible
position
that
it
would
recognize
that
a
meaningful
appeal
could
not
be
brought,
but
its
hands
would
then
be
effectively
tied
to
allow
such
an
appeal
to
come
forward.
i
do
not
believe
that's
a
tenable
situation.
i
don't
think
illinois
supreme
court
would
so
interpret
their
own
rule.
petitioner
here,
i
submit,
rejects
out
of
hand
what
draper
suggests
and
it
is
not
a
hand
to
help
the
court
understand
why
the
alternative
courses
are
found
wanting?
instead
he
asks
this
court
to
expand
griffin
beyond
the
clear
and
meaningful
limit
to
that
rule
and
its
successors
beyond
the
bounds
of
logic
and
beyond
what
i
submit
to
be
the
capabilities
of
the
appellate
processes
as
in
illinois
and
perhaps
throughout
the
nation.
the
troubled
journey
which
griffin
and
its
successors
seek
to
alleviate
for
the
indigent
criminal
defendant
as
he
struggles
to
maintain
his
liberty
cannot
abide,
i
submit,
his
purpose
for
meandering
off
the
path.
the
record
must
clearly
disclose
the
inadequacies
or
unavailability
of
multiple
remedies.
appellate
makes
no
attempt
in
this
regard
and
i
submit
that
counsel
errs
in
his
brief
at
page
37
when
he
suggests
that
california
requires
no
such
showing.
the
california
rule
as
to
a
free
transcript
in
misdemeanor
cases
is
set
forth
in
the
1970
case
of
joe
z.
versus
superior
court
reported
at
3
california
3rd,
page
54.
when
the
court
in
that
case
held
that
before
an
indigent
misdemeanor
is
entitled
to
a
free
transcript
on
appeal,
he
must
first
attempt
to
reach
an
agreement
upon
a
settled
statement.
the
transcript
would
be
provided
only
of
the
parties
cannot
agree
or
for
settle
statement
would
be
inadequate.
the
misdemeanor
then
court
quotes,
“must
show
in
a
reasonably
particularized
presentation
the
reason
why
he
cannot
inform
the
reviewing
court
by
a
settled
statement
of
the
claimed
inadequacies
and
error.”
i
submit
to
you
it
is
impossible
to
determine
whether
the
parties
cannot
agree
or
whether
a
settled
statement
would
be
inadequate
unless
there
has
first
been
a
real
attempt
at
an
agreement.
it
is
the
burden
of
indigency
that
the
cases
seek
to
relieve.
mayer
in
this
case
would
champion
that
cause
into
a
calculated
disregard
for
alternate
methods
of
presenting
an
appeal
which
this
court
has
previously
approved
of
them
both
griffin
and
draper
and
which
the
illinois
supreme
court
has
by
rule
subsequently
adopted.
if
a
full
stenographer's
transcript
must
be
produced
as
matter
of
right
or
as
a
matter
of
simple
preference
unrelated
to
cost,
unrelated
to
convenience
or
necessity
or
even
unrelated
to
rule
of
court
then
the
alternatives
to
the
extravagance
suggested
in
draper
must
be
overruled.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
these
two
points
were
brought
to
the
illinois
supreme
court
--
mr.
richard
l.
curry
--
on
motion
not
on
brief
your
honor
and
the
extensive
fashion
in
which
they
were
discussed
in
brief
in
this
court
was
not,
i
submit,
brought
to
the
attention
to
the
court
to
that
extent.
the
alleged
prosecutorial
error
and
prejudicial
treatment
in
the
manner
that
charges
to
the
jury
were
given
in
the
broadest
terms,
in
the
same
terms
at
least
raise
them
in
this
court.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
right
and
they
are
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
but
he
has
never
tried
--
mr.
richard
l.
curry
i
believe
that
he
overstated
--
mr.
richard
l.
curry
he
is
overstating
his
argument.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
no,
sir,
justice
stewart.
the
point
--
the
point
that
i
think
is
important
and
i
think
the
meaningful
reasons
for
the
alternatives
in
the
us
--
in
the
illinois
supreme
court
rule
is
that
it
is
incumbent
upon
those
to
whom
a
transcript
is
not
available
either
because
of
their
indigency
or
because
of
their
unwillingness
to
pay
for
it
from
their
own
funds,
it
is
incumbent
upon
them
before
they
ask
the
state
to
show
the
illinois
supreme
court
why
they
cannot
bring
the
record
to
the
court
in
one
of
these
alternate
fashions.
he
did
not
do
this
in
this
case
and
--
mr.
richard
l.
curry
i
am
lost,
i
am
in
the
abstract,
the
us
abstract.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
sorry.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
i
believe
it
was,
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
but
it
is
conclusionary
in
--
mr.
richard
l.
curry
i
would
have
him
point
out,
would
have
inquired
of
the
prosecutor
as
the
prosecutor’s
willingness
to
be
engaged
in
a
settlement,
a
possible
settled
statement
before
the
court.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
i
do
not
suppose
they
would
but
i
believe
your
honor
that
we
should
have
an
hearing
of
that
issue
for
the
benefit
of
the
rule
so
that
the
supreme
court
would
know
that
its
rule
was
not
flagrantly
been
disregarded,
but
there
was
an
attempt
to
adhere
to
the
rule.
if
he
was
able
come
forward
and
say
that
the
prosecutor
who
handle
this
case
was
unavailable
or
unwilling
participate
in
a
negotiated
settlement
i
would
say
that
would
be
meaningful
information
for
illinois
supreme
court
to
hear.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
if
he
said
that
he
had
gone
to
the
trial
judge
and
asked
the
trial
judge
what
his
minutes
book
showed
as
to
notes
of
what
his
recollection
was
i
would
say
that
those
would
be
meaningful
comments
that
the
illinois
supreme
court
would
utilize
in
determining
then
the
appropriateness
or
the
true
meaningfulness
of
his
application
for
a
free
transcript,
that
he
really
would
not
be
before
them
in
any
meaningful
fashion
unless
he
was
able
to
have
one
or
the
other.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
persecutor
would
be
able
to
foreclose
the
appeal
by
denying.
if
the
prosecutor
denied
it
then
i
think
the
illinois
supreme
court
would
remedy
that
by
granting
him
the
free
transcript.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
i
mean
it
is
not
as
absolute
as
it's
read.
i
mean
that
in
the
application
of
the
rule
the
court
would
clearly
require
an
exhaustion
first
of
alternates
and
then
recognize
that
the
mere
filing
would
not
give
the
person
present
before
them.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
it
would
be
important
before
--
mr.
richard
l.
curry
the
authority
would
be
on
the
basis
of
that
court’s
close
attention
to
the
language
of
this
court’s
decision
in
griffin
and
--
mr.
richard
l.
curry
no,
sir
there
is
no
case
that
i
know
of.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
no,
i
have
none
at
the
illinois
supreme
court
level
justice
stewart.
what
i
know
clearly
though
is
that
at
the
lower
level,
in
the
trial
level
there
are
number
of
instances
where
despite
the
fact
that
there
are
alternatives
available
and
despite
the
fact
the
rule
calls
for
no
transcripts
over
90
days
that
the
trial
level
in
many
instances
in
my
experience
as
corporation
counsel
does
grant
a
transcript
to
the
indigent.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
it
is
utilized
as
a
matter
of
discretion
and
not
brought
into
challenge
by
in
any
case
that
i
am
aware
of
in
illinois.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
i
really
believe
that
the
weight
and
the
import
of
the
williams
case
would
be
so
profound
on
the
illinois
supreme
court
to
justify
belief
that
they
would
effectively
render
this
petitioner's
appeal
meaningless
by
denying
him
all
avenues
if
he
were
to
effectively
show
them
that
the
two
alternatives
that
they
suggest
are
meaningless
than
i
do
believe
that
they
would
remedy
the
incongruity
that
exists
there
and
require
a
free
transcript
be
provided.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
i
do
not
believe
i
am
saying
that
at
all
sir.
i
am
obviously
reading
into
it
more
than
the
usual
language
is
there,
but
i
do
not
believe
the
rule
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
there
has
to
be
such
showing.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
i
submit
that
there
is
nothing
like
that
in
the
state.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
it
does
not
sir.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
the
rules
follows
very
closely
the
language
in
duncan
where
alternatives
were
suggested
by
this
court
as
the
means
that
the
state
may
utilize
to
avoid
the
impact
of
extravagance,
frivolous
appeal
to
what
have
you?
i
submit
that
in
following
that
logic
the
court
clearly
wrestled
with
the
subject
and
has
a
rule
which
is
not
keeping
with
griffin
and
is
not
keeping
with
duncan
and
when
we
come
to
a
fact
situation
which
we
really
have
not
come
to
in
this
case
or
any
case
that
i
know
of
in
illinois
where
the
two
other
alternatives
are
shown
to
have
been
attempted
and
to
be
wanting
in
brining
a
meaningful
record
to
the
court.
we
haven't
come
to
the
case
where
then
the
illinois
supreme
court
would
deny.
i
do
believe
that
if
a
--
mr.
richard
l.
curry
pardon,
i
would
hypotheticate
that
there
would
never
be
such
a
case
in
illinois.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
i
do
not
believe
there
would
be,
sir.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
there
could
be
surely,
but
i
do
not
believe
there
would
be
for
simple
reason
that
the
purpose
of
the
rule
in
my
opinion
clearly
and
unmistakably
indicates
the
ruling
is
on
the
part
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
to
have
the
litigant
available
to
come
before
him
and
present
a
meaningful
record
of
what
transpired.
it
does
--
it
is
presents
alternatives
and
it
seems
to
me
that
when
have
early
say
i
do
not
want
alternative
b
and
i
do
not
i
want
alternative
c,
i
must
have
alternative
a
that
is
not
keeping
with
what
the
illinois
supreme
court
rule
has
in
mind.
if
you
took
away
the
first
two
problems
where
you
did
meet
that
issue
then
i
do
believe
that
in
illinois
a
free
transcript
would
be
forthcoming.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
prosecutor.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
one
of
the
errors
alleged
is
that
the
prosecutor
limped
in
the
courtroom.
the
prosecutor
was
although
injured
in
that
same
affair,
he
did
limp
in
the
courtroom
as
you
would
be
uncertain,
perfectly
willing
to
agree
that
he
limped
in
the
courtroom
that
day,
if
that
is
prosecutorial
error.
i
do
not
believe
it
is
but
i
know
--
mr.
richard
l.
curry
but
neither
--
mr.
richard
l.
curry
is
he
bound
by
them,
i
believe
that
it
would
be
very
similar,
the
negotiation
that
would
go
on
during
a
agreed
statement
or
a
settled
statement
would
be
very
similar
to
the
kind
of
negotiations
that
goes
on
when
lawyers
and
the
judges
get
together
over
instructions
to
the
jury.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
the
judge
will
resolve.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
that's
my
understanding.
he
would
have
available
to
him,
the
note,
the
minutes
note
that
he
made
as
you
said
there.
he
would
also
have
i
submit
available
to
him
the
participation
of
the
un-transcribed
notes
from
the
court
reporter
if
he
sought
them
and
thought
they
were
necessary.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
i
know
of
none.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
there
is
none.
there
is
no
showing
throughout
the
record
that
any
attempt
has
been
made
to
secure
an
agreed
statement.
i
take
issue
with
mr.
field's
statement
that
despite
two
days
of
trial
he
would
find
it
impossible
to
prepare
such
a
statement.
i
would
brought
your
attention
to
the
extensive
post
trial
notice
which
appears
in
your
abstract
at
page
11
through
22,
14
pages
i
might
add
of
in
depth
analysis
of
what
did
transpire
at
that
hearing.
i
submit
that
this
almost
in
itself
would
be
tantamount
to
a
record
made
under
either
one
of
these
proposals
by
the
illinois
supreme
court.
the
cases
since
griffin
give
the
support
of
the
kind
of
balance
that
judicial
propriety
found
in
duncan.
that
is
the
consequences
to
the
defendant
from
the
conviction
of
a
petty
offense
are
insufficient
to
what
were
the
benefits
to
efficient
law
enforcement
as
simplified
judicial
administration.
in
applying
fourteenth
amendment,
rinaldi
versus
yeager
says,
these
avenues
of
appeal
must
be
kept
free
of
unreasoned
distinctions.
i
believe
that
there
is
reason
distinction
in
the
illinois
supreme
court
rule.
the
distinction
being
between
petty
and
serious
and
i
believe
that
is
very
important
distinction
that
ought
to
be
respected
in
future
decision
by
the
court.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
six
months
is
the
distinction
made
by
the
illinois
supreme
court
rule,
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
right
same
as
the
federal
rule.
the
classification
would
fail
we're
told
in
shapiro
versus
thompson
unless
shown
to
be
necessary
to
promote
a
compelling
governmental
interest.
i
submit
to
you
that
a
compelling
elemental
interest
is
very
real
here
in
the
viability
of
the
court
systems
at
the
lower
level,
but
most
apparently
at
the
appellate
level,
if
appeals
on
full
transcripts
to
indigence
are
the
outgrowth
of
the
rule
of
this
case
and
finally
in
boddie
versus
connecticut
the
court
mentioning
the
absence
of
countervailing
state
interest
of
overriding
significance
and
classification
must
fail.
i
say
to
you
that
a
classification
such
as
we
have
here
between
serious
and
petty
is
a
countervailing
state
interest
of
overriding
significance.
i
would
respectfully
ask
this
court
to
reject
what's
urged
by
the
appellant
and
not
expand
the
rule
in
griffin
into
the
petty
offense
area.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
certainly.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
that
right.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
means
if
none
is
available
by
indigency,
means
if
none
is
available
by
--
mr.
richard
l.
curry
not
obtainable
in
this
case
because
he
cannot
pay
for
it,
i
submit
justice.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
none
that
i
know.
mr.
richard
l.
curry
thank
you.
