mr.
field,
is
it
true
that
in
traffic
court
you
do
not
have
scenario,
do
have
one
in
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
in
chicago?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
you
have
the
scenarios
in
the
traffic
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean,
not
throughout
the
country,
that's
my
problem?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
what
i
mean.
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
i
understand,
your
opposition
is
that
if
you
do
not
have
a
transcript,
but
you
do
have
de
novo,
that
is
okay?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
get
a
transcript.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that's
what
i
understand
you
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
curry,
i
am
troubled
with
the
fact
that
the
circuit
court
has
said
frankly
i
do
not
care
what
you
do,
you
are
not
untitled
for
it?
the
rule
says
you
cannot
get
it.
he
didn't
mention
anything
about
any
alternative.
he
made
a
rule
on
--
his
ruling
was
based
on
the
rule
of
the
court
and
that
is
what
we
have
before
us,
am
i
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
was
it
not
that
where
it
was
in
circuit
court?
when
the
ruling
in
this
case
was
made
the
judge
was
not
interested
in
any
other
thing,
am
i
my
right
or
wrong?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
agree
--
do
you
think
he
was
right
or
do
you
think
it
was
in
error?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
he
was
in
error?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
he
is
correct
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why,
because
of
the
rule?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
afraid
i
haven't
made
that
clear.
i
take
it
you
are
arguing
about
the
supreme
court,
the
difference
between
the
ruling
of
the
circuit
court
and
the
supreme
court
and
as
i
understand
it,
there
is
not
too
much
disagreement
between
you
and
mr.
field
on
supreme
court
obviously
because
the
page
after
page
of
arguing
this
point
and
that
i
understand
that
there
is
no
disagreement.
i
would
just
think
that
the
original
ruling
i
think
was
wrong.
now,
the
court,
the
supreme
court’s
ruling
i
take
is
is
different
matter
that
is
my
only
point.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
just
have
a
quick
problem
of
how
you
get
an
agreed
statement
on
“prosecutorial
misconduct
in
many
instances
throughout
the
trial”?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
you
can
do
that
without
a
transcript,
i
have
great
difficulty,
thinking?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
know
what
other.
you
said
throughout
the
trial
(voice
overlap)
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
if
he
put
these
statements
down
and
submits
them
and
they
are
not
agreed
upon,
is
he
bound
by
those
statements?
justice
