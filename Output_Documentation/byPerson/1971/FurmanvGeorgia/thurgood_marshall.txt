justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
true
that
new
york,
there
is
such
a
statute,
that
is
restricted
the
killing
of
a
prison
guard?
justice
thurgood
marshall
let
us
ask
them
to
the
last
case,
how
many
are
there
in
death
row
in
california?
justice
thurgood
marshall
at
the
time
the
last
time
the
legislature
was
used
to
abolish
the
death
penalty
(inaudible)?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
can
you
say
that
it
is
because
they
are
so
few?
if
you
take
the
state
of
california
and
there
is
one
that
you
try
to
get
numerous
mileage
on
the
frame?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
the
state
flaw
in
the
law
(inaudible)?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mrs.
beasley,
did
the
(inaudible)
that
the
state
would
not
impose
unnecessary
change,
the
plaintiffs
of
this
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
recognized
a
little
more
than
just
due
process,
it
is
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
even
just
thought
in
that
case
recognized
that
the
eighth
amendment
was
a
part,
well,
applicable
to
the
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
are
now
saying
it
is
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
under
the
state
provides
that
death,
i
mean,
provides
execution?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible).
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
true
there
are
others
too.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
if
you
shoot
a
man
and
make
a
vegetable
out
of
him,
you
cannot
kill
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
completely
emphasized
that
they
did
it,
he
is
out
of
his
mind
and
anything
out
of
the
standing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
just
cannot
have
hang
him.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
our
problem
is
to
get
to
the
equal
protection
clause.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
would
you
be
--
your
answer
to
the
petition
in
georgia
shows
that
the
only
people
under
the
history
of
georgia
ever
given
the
death
penalty
in
rape
or
in
mexicans
where
mexicans
(inaudible)
would
your
argument
be
the
same?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh!
my
answer
is
this
that
no
jury
has
ever
sentenced
any
white
man
with
rape,
and
every
negroes
convicted
rape
has
been
sentenced
to
death,
you
would
have
any
problem
with
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
not
this
case,
does
it
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
decide
to
get
it
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
was
not
presented.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
distinguish?
justice
thurgood
marshall
last
thing
i
was
talking
about
was
psychiatrist.
i
was
talking
about
these
figures.
justice
thurgood
marshall
under
the
laws
of
texas,
how
final
is
that
(inaudible)
either
or
neither
the
judge
or
the
jury?
justice
thurgood
marshall
once
he
decides
to
go
for
the
death
penalty,
how
final
is
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
hurts
the
defendant?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
assuming
that
he
is
wrong
in
saying
this,
how
does
that
reach
the
issue
of
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
guess
you
would
say
that
some
of
your
lawyers
will
say
that
the
prosecutor
prosecutes
the
case
and
the
man
is
guilty
but
that
is
not
what
we
have
had
is
not
issue
as
that
the
court
right.
it
does
say
that
the
prosecutor
and
attorney,
i
do
not
see
what
is
so
great
about
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
do
not
--
do
you
know
of
any
states
that
prohibits
the
prosecutor
for
he
is
a
--
or
makes
the
prosecutor
to
make
the
choice
of
whether
he
goes
for
the
death
penalty
or
not.
do
you
know
of
any
state?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
know
of
any
state
in
which
there
is
not
a
mandatory
death
penalty,
it
does
not
give
the
prosecutor
the
right
to
either
go
to
for
the
death
penalty
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
any
prosecutor
in
this
country
can
make
the
same
statement
and
if
so
what
is
so
different
about
texas?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
can
do
that
in
texas?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
treason
that
resulted
in
(inaudible)
10,000
soldiers?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
you
can't
and
it
says
you
are
lying
and
he
says
yes.
if
it
does
not
involve
death
person
in
this
so
far.
justice
thurgood
marshall
attempt
on
the
president’s
life?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
fact
seems
unloaded
with
50
caliber
machine
guns,
bullets
and
somebody
is
grabbed
just
before
it
pulls
the
trigger?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
true
that
new

there
is
such
a

that
is

the
