mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
to
review
a
death
penalty
rape
conviction
in
wilbarger
county
district
court
in
the
state
of
texas.
the
evidence
produced
by
the
state
which
was
uncontroverted
by
any
other
evidence
put
on
by
the
defendant,
petitioner
in
this
case,
indicated
that
in
the
early
morning
hours,
a
young
negro
male,
later
identified
to
be
the
petitioner,
forced
his
way
into
the
home
of
the
complainant,
and
assaulted
her,
raped
her,
conversation
ensued
thereafter
for
sometime,
he
then
left
and
was
arrested,
convicted
and
given
the
death
penalty.
there
was
absolutely
no
medical
testimony
showing
any
type
of
injury
of
any
sort
to
the
complainant
in
this
case.
we
feel
that
capital
punishment
in
this
case
is
unusual
under
the
eighth
amendment
for
two
basic
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
standards
by
which
we
suggest
this
court
to
gauge
whether
or
not
capital
punishment
is
unusual
in
any
case,
indicate
that
it
is
unusual
in
terms
of
frequency
of
use.
the
fact
that
it
is
used
on
identifiable
minority
and
the
fact
that
it
has
a
historical
pattern
of
use
in
the
south
upon
blacks.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
standards
which
are
appropriate,
pardon
me,
for
this
court’s
use
are
those
laid
out
in
baker
versus
car,
brown
versus
board
of
education,
and
jacobellis
versus
ohio.
that
is
to
say,
national
standard
must
be
employed
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
use
of
any
punishment
in
any
one
case
in
any
county
or
state
is
unusual
or
is
not
unusual.
applying
the
national
standards,
we
see
that
there
are
a
very
limited
number
of
states
that
use
capital
punishment
as
punishment
for
the
offense
of
rape.
in
going
to
texas,
we
have
some
statistics
in
an
article
by
koeninger
which
i
have
cited
in
the
brief.
i
think
these
statistics
go
farther
than
most
statistics
that
have
been
presented
to
the
court.
koeninger
studies
go
not
only
to
the
number
of
blacks
who
have
received
the
death
penalty
for
rape,
but
they
also
cover
the
frequency
with
which
any
defendant
accused
of
rape
can
expect
to
receive
the
death
penalty.
so,
the
fact
that
89%
or
90%
of
all
persons
convicted
of
rape
and
given
the
death
penalty
in
texas
are
black,
might
be
a
convincing
argument,
but
we
feel
that
a
more
convincing
argument
is
the
fact
that
when
a
black
man
in
texas
is
convicted
of
rape,
he
has
an
88%
chance
of
receiving
a
death
penalty,
and
this
is
in
contradiction
to
the
22%
chance
that
any
white
or
chicano
faces
in
the
same
situation.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
this
percentage
is
based
on
koeninger’s
article
in
which
he
says
the
ratio
–
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
here
is
in
the
brief
at
pages
19
and
20
justice
douglas.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
the
amazing
thing
that
i
found
in
the
koeninger
studies
is,
there
has
been
some
instances
in
texas
of
joint
trial,
a
negro
and
a
white
defendant
accused
of
raping
the
same
person
at
the
same
time,
and
koeninger
studies
indicate
that
in
these
type
of
cases,
the
negro
invariably
will
get
the
death
penalty,
whereas
the
white
or
the
latin
american
will
be
spared
that
fate.
now,
the
state
has
attempted
to
refute
some
of
these
statistics
by
saying
that
negros
commit
more
rapes.
they
cite
some
sort
of
in
denver’s
statistics,
i
do
not
think
these
are
applicable
in
view
of
koeninger's
thoroughness,
because
koeninger
uses
pure
statistics.
the
expectancy
of
the
death
penalty
on
a
racial
basis
as
opposed
to
the
percentages
of
race
who
get
death
and
who
do
not
get
death
and
then
another
interesting
point
that
concerns
this
case
only;
in
texas,
the
legislature
has
seen
fit
to
create
a
number
of
offenses,
all
of
which
conceivably
could
be
charged
in
a
rape
situation.
there
is
the
offense
of
aggravated
assault,
male
or
female
to
the
offense
of
murder
or
assault
to
murder
with
or
without
malice.
the
only
--
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
your
honor,
i
believe
it
was
briefed
very
generally
in
the
brief,
i
did
not
participate
until
after
the
conviction
was
affirmed.
i
have
a
problem
where
no
statistics
or
no
proof
introduced
at
the
trial
level
or
on
any
hearings
or
motion
for
new
trial.
it
was,
i
believe
mentioned
in
the
brief
filed
by
the
petitioner’s
court
appointed
attorney
in
the
court
of
criminal
appeals.
the
only
difference
between
an
assault
to
rape
or
assault
to
murder
or
aggravated
assault
and
rape
is
the
act
of
intercourse.
the
punishment
for
any
man
who
assaults
any
woman
in
the
state
of
texas
cannot
exceed
25
years,
unless
he
accomplishes
the
act
of
rape,
in
which
case,
the
punishment
goes
from
25
years
to
death.
we
feel
that
this
is
certainly
an
inconsistency
within
the
legislative
penalogical
system
in
texas
which
ought
to
be
considered
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
use
of
the
death
penalty
for
rape
coupled
with
what
i
consider
to
be
light
punishment
in
assault
cases
of
similar
nature
is
unusual
because
of
this
distinction.
in
the
state
of
texas,
there
is
another
consideration
that
sheds
light
and
at
this
point
i
might
say
that
it
perhaps
was
improperly
briefed
as
my
fifth
point,
i
think
that
the
mention
of
the
facts
under
that
fifth
point
has
bearing
an
issue
to
be
decided
here
not
whether
or
not
article
1
14
authorizing
the
prosecutor
to
seek
a
way
of
the
death
penalty
is
unconstitutional.
clearly,
that
was
not
raised
the
below,
however,
the
grant
of
legislative
authority
to
all
the
prosecutors
in
texas
which
enables
them
to
select
who
will
be
candidates
for
the
death
penalty
and
who
will
not
be
candidates,
obtains
as
a
forceful
argument
in
this
case
in
support
of
this
petitioner's
point.
i
think
the
argument
made
by
the
district
attorney
in
this
case
points
out
this.
he
told
the
gentleman
of
the
jury
that
the
responsibility
lies
with
me
and
solely
with
me
for
you
being
qualified
on
the
death
penalty.
the
state
allows
me,
the
law
allows
me
as
state’s
attorney
to
waive
the
death
penalty,
but
it
also
directs
me
in
a
case,
i
am
going
to
insist
in
the
death
penalty
that
i
give
written
notice
to
the
defendant.
i
do
not
know
how
much
confidence
you
folks
have
in
me
as
your
district
attorney,
but
i
am
telling
you
gentlemen,
had
i
not
thought
that
this
case
that
justified
the
supreme
penalty
i
would
have
waived
the
death
penalty.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
frankly,
your
honor,
i
do
not
know.
i
have
seen
some
statutes
which
do
not
have
it
and
i
have
not
investigated
all
of
the
statutes,
that
a
lot
of
them
of
course
were
not
tied
into
rape
statutes
and
i
was
unable
to
get
all
of
it.
i
would
say
that
if
it
is
common
to
all
the
other
states
then
it
would
have
to
suffer
the
same
defect
in
other
states
as
it
does
in
texas,
that
the
grant
of
this
authority
to
the
district
attorney
to
in
effect
change
the
range
of
punishment,
depending
upon
any
number
of
factors
which
he
alone
controls
such
as
the
race
of
the
defendants,
the
facts
of
the
case.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
because
when
the
prosecutor
makes
a
decision,
he
could
make
a
decision
based
on
facts
that
are
available
to
him,
whether
or
not
he
thinks
he
can
prove
up
to
the
case,
whether
or
not
he
thinks
he
can
get
a
conviction
for
burglary
as
opposed
to
breaking
and
entering
a
private
property
or
something
like
this.
the
difference,
the
main
difference
is
that
the
legislature
has
assigned
a
range
of
punishment
for
this
crime,
but
that
range
of
punishment
is
really
very
nebulous
until
the
defendant
knows
with
certainty
whether
or
not
the
prosecutor
is
going
to
seek
the
death
penalty.
the
prosecutor
instead
of
choosing
the
offense
based
on
the
law
and
based
on
the
facts
of
the
case,
is
changing
the
range
of
punishment.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
once
the
judge
--
well,
once
the
state
has
decided
not
to
seek
the
death
penalty,
the
death
penalty
cannot
be
given.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
he
certainly
can
waive
his
right
to
go
for
it
by
asking
for
something
less
or
by
withdrawing
his
notice
prior
to
trial,
but
the
point
is
that
unless
he
asks
for
the
death
penalty
as
prescribed
by
statute,
it
cannot
be
given
by
the
jury.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
i
think
it
does,
your
honor
because
perhaps
if
he
does
not
have
this
authority,
a
jury
is
not
going
to
be
told
what
this
prosecutor
told
this
jury.
mr.
renthro
(ph)
is
an
elected
public
official
and
he
is
elected
by
those
people
on
the
jury.
he
is
telling
them
that
it
is
my
decision,
the
legislature
has
given
this
decision
to
me
and
i
have
decided
to
the
exclusion
of
all
the
other
cases,
this
is
the
one
that
i
want
you
to
--
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
i
do
not
think
we
can
assume
--
if
we
assume
he
was
wrong
in
saying
it,
we
would
have
a
jury
that
did
not
believe
in
him
and
we
would
not
have
a
death
penalty
case.
i
mean,
he
is
right
in
saying
that
the
legislature
does
give
him
the
authority
because
the
district
attorneys
in
texas
have
the
absolute
authority
to
seek
and
waive
the
death
penalty.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
i
do
not
think
it
is
a
question
of
their
faith
and
it
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
prosecutor
ought
to
have
a
right
to
change
the
range
of
punishment
for
any
reason
that
he
desires.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
well,
your
honor
in
the
state
of
texas,
if
one
is
charged
with
of
burning
of
the
state
capital,
there
is
a
mandatory
death
penalty.
so
--
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
if
i
understand
the
question
correctly,
my
answer
would
be
i
do
not
know
of
any
state
that
does
not
give
the
prosecutor
the
choice.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
because
in
some
other
state
where
the
prosecutor
does
not
have
the
requirement
to
impose
to
file
a
notice,
the
jury
could
override
the
prosecutor's
will
and
still
assess
the
death
penalty.
in
texas
--
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
in
texas,
the
jury
cannot,
once
the
prosecutor
has
given
notice
not
to
seek
the
death
penalty.
the
jury
may
not
assess
the
death
penalty,
if
they
do
it
is
a
void
judgment.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
it
is
a
void
judgment
and
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
would
either
remand
it
or
a
reverse
it.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
that
is
correct.
that
is
correct,
the
full
range
of
punishment
then
applies
and
we
have
briefed
in
the
brief
the
point
that
this
can
be
used
against
identifiable
racial
minority
by
the
prosecutor
and
i
think
it
is
a
valid
consideration
in
support
of
the
fact
that
identifiable
racial
minorities
in
texas
do
receive
the
death
penalty.
the
fact
that
perhaps
whites
and
chicanos
do
not
get
death
penalty
as
frequently
as
blacks
is
due
in
large
part
for
the
fact
that
the
prosecutor
simply
does
not
ask
for
it.
he
will
waive
it,
thinking
that
he
cannot
get
it
or
just
not
wanting
to
get
it
for
any
number
of
good
reasons.
i
do
not
think
that
the
issue
of
capital
punishment
in
a
rape
case
such
as
this
need
to
hang
on
all
the
arguments
made
for
abolition
of
capital
punishment
in
any
case.
i
think
the
opinion
in
ralph
against
warden
clearly
points
out
that
the
infrequency
of
its
use,
the
infrequency
of
its
availability
across
this
nation
indicates
that
it
is
not
a
fit
punishment
and
i
think
that
the
argument
which
would
be
urged
in
support
of
an
equal
protection
argument
or
due
process
argument
would
obtain
in
an
argument
to
show
that
it
was
unusual.
as
far
as
the
question
of
whether
or
not
unusual
should
be
defined
by
new
or
old
standards,
i
would
cite
the
court
to
the
case
mr.
justice
white's
dissent
in
weems
which
is
the
third
objective
of
unusual
--
definition
of
unusual
delayed
downwards
operation
in
usual
prohibition
operates
to
restrain
any
law
making
power
from
endowing
the
judiciary
with
the
right
to
exert
an
legal
discretion
as
to
the
kind
and
extent
of
punishment
to
be
inflicted,
but
that
has
to
be
measured
in
contemporary
terms
by
contemporary
standards,
not
by
standards
of
two
centuries
ago.
otherwise,
the
word
unusual
has
no
meaning
because
it
restricts
by
what
occurred
back
in
the
1700’s.
please
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
argument
for
rebuttal.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
yes
mr.
chief
justice,
a
few
answers.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
asked
about
the
evidence
with
respect
to
the
harm
done
to
prosecute
--
in
a
rape
case
it
has
consistently
been
held
admissible
by
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
as
part
of
the
(inaudible).
i
believe
the
record
in
this
case
shows
that
mrs.
stowe
(ph),
the
complaining
witness
went
to
her
home
with
her
son,
took
a
bath
and
never
even
sought
the
aid
of
the
doctor,
consequently
i
would
assume
from
that
there
was
no
medical
testimony
available
as
the
state
decided
to
put
some
on.
the
answer
is
they
could
have
put
some
on.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
no,
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
consistently
held
that
the
prosecutor's
testimony
concerning
penetration
and
so
forth
is
sufficient
and
need
not
be
collaborated.
in
answer
to
the
other
question
about
the
frequency
of
application
of
article
1
14,
it
is
the
precise
application
of
article
1
14
is
unusual
and
is
not
common
outside
of
the
state
of
texas.
there
are
two
points
that
mr.
wright
has
made,
i
think
there
is
some
searching.
first
of
all
he
says,
professor
amsterdam’s
argument
that
society
is
now
repulsed
by
these
--
of
the
death
penalty
is
refuted
because
the
majority
of
the
states
have
the
death
penalty,
ergo
the
death
penalty
was
acceptable
to
the
majority
of
americans.
however,
no
argument
is
advanced
in
support
of
the
proposition
that
a
minority
of
the
state
has
the
death
penalty
for
rape
only
ergo
it
is
unusual.
i
think
that
the
fact
that
the
minority
of
the
states
have
retained
death
penalty
for
rape
only
leads
to
the
conclusion
drawn
by
the
majority
in
ralph
v.
warden.
the
other
point
that
is
made
by
the
briefs
and
not
made
quite
so
strongly
is
the
fact
that
retribution
is
recognized
by
the
state
of
texas
as
a
very
important
part
of
punishment.
i
would
think
that
it
would
be
extremely
hard
to
justify
retribution
where
the
purpose
of
retribution
is
pure
vengeance.
if
you
have
not
got
a
life
taken,
how
do
you
justify
the
taking
of
life?
are
you
doing
something
greater,
punishing
greater
than
the
crime
itself.
this
is
where
the
proportionality
of
(inaudible)
comes
into
play
and
this
is
where
i
believe
this
court
has
the
right
to
determine
proportionality
of
punishment
and
to
draw
lines
with
respect
to
(inaudible)
and
to
work
out
standards,
and
if
standards
cannot
be
worked
out,
then
in
any
event
to
at
least
send
the
cases
back
to
the
state
legislatures
and
let
them
establish
standards
such
as
nevada
did.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
exactly.

there
is

the

of

to
me
you
are
taking
a

for

less

has
occurred.
there
is
absolutely
no

based
on
retribution
in

point

of

the

do
not

it
would
be
cruel
and
unusual
in
any

or
another

more
than
simply
showing

at

is
proved
by

would

mr.

that
was

would
say
that

texas
--
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
if
it
involves
any
death
or
endangering
any
person,
now
that
is
not
to
say
that
you
may
not
have
more
than
an
immediate
victim.
you
may
have
a
victim
once
or
twice
removed
in
the
case
of
treason,
the
delivery
of
secret
plans
which
may
cost
a
life
of
other
men,
you
would
have
victims
which
are
--
in
fact,
that
they
are
not
dead
or
injured
can
be
shown
from
the
act.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
unless
there
are
facts
but
i
can
see.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
i
can
see
no
real
distinction
between
the
attempt
on
the
president’s
life
and
the
attempt
on
any
person’s
life,
and
unless
there
are
medical
facts
in
a
record
showing
some
sort
of
injury
to
the
person,
i
can
see
no
reason
for
the
taking
of
life.
the
taking
of
life
in
my
opinion
and
i
think
in
the
opinion
of
the
majority
in
the
ralph
case
must
necessarily
depend
upon
the
harm
which
is
done.
the
punishment
must
be
made
to
fit
the
harm
done
not
exceed
it.
to
taking
the
life
--
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
i
am
sorry
i
did
not.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
i
think
very
nicely
because
taking
into
recognition
the
advanced
techniques
that
we
are
now
aware
of
and
that
are
being
used
in
prison
systems,
i
think
sentencing
now
has
become
more
function
of
parole
boards
and
experienced
people
in
the
penitentiary
system.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
or
endanger
to
such
a
degree
that
medical
attention
was
necessary
to
save
the
life.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
under
the
eighth
amendment,
i
see
no
limitation
as
far
as
what
the
legislature
of
the
states
may
do
because
--
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
the
main
thing
is
the
taking
of
the
life.
that
is
the
thing
that
distinguishes
the
rape
case
from
the
murder
case
and
the
rape
case
from
anything.
that
taking
the
life
without
demonstrable
evidence
that
the
taking
of
the
life
is
necessary
and
flows
from
the
act,
it
is
unusual
and
that
may
make
it
cruel
as
well.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
i
did
not
say
necessarily
substantial.
medical
evidence
showing
that
some
harm
had
occurred.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
some
harm
had
occurred,
some
physical
harm
and
that
perhaps
sought
for
medical
attention
that
would
have
been
problems,
how
serious
the
problems
maybe
is
i
do
not
think,
it
may
not
even
be
a
question
for
this
court.
it
may
really
be
a
question
for
the
legislature.
i
think—
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
i
am
sorry
i
should
have
not
excluded
it
no.
if
there
is
testimony
of
some
disorder
of
the
mind
has
resulted
of
it,
i
think
that
would
also
be
a
very
important
factor
whether
or
not
the
death
penalty
was
permissible.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
no,
i
would
draw
a
line
at
some
point.
the
harm
would
have
to
be
of
such
a
nature
that
it
might
lead
to
incapacity
or
even
death.
for
instance,
in
the
branch
case,
the
mere
pressing
of
the
arm
across
the
throat
which
did
not
necessitate
medical
attention,
i
do
not
see
how
that
could
possibly
be
a
serious
crime
such
as
to
justify
the
taking
of
the
life
because
as
i
have
said
originally,
in
texas,
a
man
could
beat
a
woman
to
the
brink
of
death
and
still
only
get
25
years
if
she
recovered,
under
our
assault
statutes.
but
if
he
beat
her
to
the
brink
of
death
and
raped
her,
perhaps
he
could
life.
it
would
be
inconsistent
and
thus
it
might
be
a
question
for
the
texas
legislature
to
resolve
because
of
the
internal
inconsistency
there,
but
i
think
the
necessity
of
drawing
that
line
is
clear
under
the
cruel
and
unusual
provision
of
the
eighth
amendment
and
that
the
least
this
court
should
do
in
this
case
is
to
remand
the
case
so
that
this
line
can
be
drawn
much
as
nevada
did
and
much
has
been
proposed
by
the
model
draft
in
texas
which
has
not
been
enacted.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
there
are
two
interesting
problems.
first
of
all,
you
are
dealing
with
a
non-civilian
and
probably
non
peacetime
crime
and
the
second
problem
is
obviously
how
do
you
show
whether
or
not
that
act
contributed
to
death
or
injury
to
somebody
else.
i
would
think
if
there
is
any
prohibitive
evidence
showing
a
contribution
to
injury
or
death,
the
answer
would
be
yes.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
if
not,
by
using
these
standards,
if
the
standards
apply
to
civilian
peacetime
crimes
and
wartime
military
crimes,
the
answer
would
be
it
would
be
cruel
and
unusual.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
to
review
a
death
penalty
rape
conviction
in
wilbarger
county
district
court
in
the
state
of
texas.
the
evidence
produced
by
the
state
which
was
uncontroverted
by
any
other
evidence
put
on
by
the
defendant,
petitioner
in
this
case,
indicated
that
in
the
early
morning
hours,
a
young
negro
male,
later
identified
to
be
the
petitioner,
forced
his
way
into
the
home
of
the
complainant,
and
assaulted
her,
raped
her,
conversation
ensued
thereafter
for
sometime,
he
then
left
and
was
arrested,
convicted
and
given
the
death
penalty.
there
was
absolutely
no
medical
testimony
showing
any
type
of
injury
of
any
sort
to
the
complainant
in
this
case.
we
feel
that
capital
punishment
in
this
case
is
unusual
under
the
eighth
amendment
for
two
basic
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
standards
by
which
we
suggest
this
court
to
gauge
whether
or
not
capital
punishment
is
unusual
in
any
case,
indicate
that
it
is
unusual
in
terms
of
frequency
of
use.
the
fact
that
it
is
used
on
identifiable
minority
and
the
fact
that
it
has
a
historical
pattern
of
use
in
the
south
upon
blacks.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
standards
which
are
appropriate,
pardon
me,
for
this
court’s
use
are
those
laid
out
in
baker
versus
car,
brown
versus
board
of
education,
and
jacobellis
versus
ohio.
that
is
to
say,
national
standard
must
be
employed
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
use
of
any
punishment
in
any
one
case
in
any
county
or
state
is
unusual
or
is
not
unusual.
applying
the
national
standards,
we
see
that
there
are
a
very
limited
number
of
states
that
use
capital
punishment
as
punishment
for
the
offense
of
rape.
in
going
to
texas,
we
have
some
statistics
in
an
article
by
koeninger
which
i
have
cited
in
the
brief.
i
think
these
statistics
go
farther
than
most
statistics
that
have
been
presented
to
the
court.
koeninger
studies
go
not
only
to
the
number
of
blacks
who
have
received
the
death
penalty
for
rape,
but
they
also
cover
the
frequency
with
which
any
defendant
accused
of
rape
can
expect
to
receive
the
death
penalty.
so,
the
fact
that
89%
or
90%
of
all
persons
convicted
of
rape
and
given
the
death
penalty
in
texas
are
black,
might
be
a
convincing
argument,
but
we
feel
that
a
more
convincing
argument
is
the
fact
that
when
a
black
man
in
texas
is
convicted
of
rape,
he
has
an
88%
chance
of
receiving
a
death
penalty,
and
this
is
in
contradiction
to
the
22%
chance
that
any
white
or
chicano
faces
in
the
same
situation.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
this
percentage
is
based
on
koeninger’s
article
in
which
he
says
the
ratio
–
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
here
is
in
the
brief
at
pages
19
and
20
justice
douglas.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
the
amazing
thing
that
i
found
in
the
koeninger
studies
is,
there
has
been
some
instances
in
texas
of
joint
trial,
a
negro
and
a
white
defendant
accused
of
raping
the
same
person
at
the
same
time,
and
koeninger
studies
indicate
that
in
these
type
of
cases,
the
negro
invariably
will
get
the
death
penalty,
whereas
the
white
or
the
latin
american
will
be
spared
that
fate.
now,
the
state
has
attempted
to
refute
some
of
these
statistics
by
saying
that
negros
commit
more
rapes.
they
cite
some
sort
of
in
denver’s
statistics,
i
do
not
think
these
are
applicable
in
view
of
koeninger's
thoroughness,
because
koeninger
uses
pure
statistics.
the
expectancy
of
the
death
penalty
on
a
racial
basis
as
opposed
to
the
percentages
of
race
who
get
death
and
who
do
not
get
death
and
then
another
interesting
point
that
concerns
this
case
only;
in
texas,
the
legislature
has
seen
fit
to
create
a
number
of
offenses,
all
of
which
conceivably
could
be
charged
in
a
rape
situation.
there
is
the
offense
of
aggravated
assault,
male
or
female
to
the
offense
of
murder
or
assault
to
murder
with
or
without
malice.
the
only
--
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
your
honor,
i
believe
it
was
briefed
very
generally
in
the
brief,
i
did
not
participate
until
after
the
conviction
was
affirmed.
i
have
a
problem
where
no
statistics
or
no
proof
introduced
at
the
trial
level
or
on
any
hearings
or
motion
for
new
trial.
it
was,
i
believe
mentioned
in
the
brief
filed
by
the
petitioner’s
court
appointed
attorney
in
the
court
of
criminal
appeals.
the
only
difference
between
an
assault
to
rape
or
assault
to
murder
or
aggravated
assault
and
rape
is
the
act
of
intercourse.
the
punishment
for
any
man
who
assaults
any
woman
in
the
state
of
texas
cannot
exceed
25
years,
unless
he
accomplishes
the
act
of
rape,
in
which
case,
the
punishment
goes
from
25
years
to
death.
we
feel
that
this
is
certainly
an
inconsistency
within
the
legislative
penalogical
system
in
texas
which
ought
to
be
considered
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
use
of
the
death
penalty
for
rape
coupled
with
what
i
consider
to
be
light
punishment
in
assault
cases
of
similar
nature
is
unusual
because
of
this
distinction.
in
the
state
of
texas,
there
is
another
consideration
that
sheds
light
and
at
this
point
i
might
say
that
it
perhaps
was
improperly
briefed
as
my
fifth
point,
i
think
that
the
mention
of
the
facts
under
that
fifth
point
has
bearing
an
issue
to
be
decided
here
not
whether
or
not
article
1
14
authorizing
the
prosecutor
to
seek
a
way
of
the
death
penalty
is
unconstitutional.
clearly,
that
was
not
raised
the
below,
however,
the
grant
of
legislative
authority
to
all
the
prosecutors
in
texas
which
enables
them
to
select
who
will
be
candidates
for
the
death
penalty
and
who
will
not
be
candidates,
obtains
as
a
forceful
argument
in
this
case
in
support
of
this
petitioner's
point.
i
think
the
argument
made
by
the
district
attorney
in
this
case
points
out
this.
he
told
the
gentleman
of
the
jury
that
the
responsibility
lies
with
me
and
solely
with
me
for
you
being
qualified
on
the
death
penalty.
the
state
allows
me,
the
law
allows
me
as
state’s
attorney
to
waive
the
death
penalty,
but
it
also
directs
me
in
a
case,
i
am
going
to
insist
in
the
death
penalty
that
i
give
written
notice
to
the
defendant.
i
do
not
know
how
much
confidence
you
folks
have
in
me
as
your
district
attorney,
but
i
am
telling
you
gentlemen,
had
i
not
thought
that
this
case
that
justified
the
supreme
penalty
i
would
have
waived
the
death
penalty.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
frankly,
your
honor,
i
do
not
know.
i
have
seen
some
statutes
which
do
not
have
it
and
i
have
not
investigated
all
of
the
statutes,
that
a
lot
of
them
of
course
were
not
tied
into
rape
statutes
and
i
was
unable
to
get
all
of
it.
i
would
say
that
if
it
is
common
to
all
the
other
states
then
it
would
have
to
suffer
the
same
defect
in
other
states
as
it
does
in
texas,
that
the
grant
of
this
authority
to
the
district
attorney
to
in
effect
change
the
range
of
punishment,
depending
upon
any
number
of
factors
which
he
alone
controls
such
as
the
race
of
the
defendants,
the
facts
of
the
case.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
because
when
the
prosecutor
makes
a
decision,
he
could
make
a
decision
based
on
facts
that
are
available
to
him,
whether
or
not
he
thinks
he
can
prove
up
to
the
case,
whether
or
not
he
thinks
he
can
get
a
conviction
for
burglary
as
opposed
to
breaking
and
entering
a
private
property
or
something
like
this.
the
difference,
the
main
difference
is
that
the
legislature
has
assigned
a
range
of
punishment
for
this
crime,
but
that
range
of
punishment
is
really
very
nebulous
until
the
defendant
knows
with
certainty
whether
or
not
the
prosecutor
is
going
to
seek
the
death
penalty.
the
prosecutor
instead
of
choosing
the
offense
based
on
the
law
and
based
on
the
facts
of
the
case,
is
changing
the
range
of
punishment.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
once
the
judge
--
well,
once
the
state
has
decided
not
to
seek
the
death
penalty,
the
death
penalty
cannot
be
given.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
he
certainly
can
waive
his
right
to
go
for
it
by
asking
for
something
less
or
by
withdrawing
his
notice
prior
to
trial,
but
the
point
is
that
unless
he
asks
for
the
death
penalty
as
prescribed
by
statute,
it
cannot
be
given
by
the
jury.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
i
think
it
does,
your
honor
because
perhaps
if
he
does
not
have
this
authority,
a
jury
is
not
going
to
be
told
what
this
prosecutor
told
this
jury.
mr.
renthro
(ph)
is
an
elected
public
official
and
he
is
elected
by
those
people
on
the
jury.
he
is
telling
them
that
it
is
my
decision,
the
legislature
has
given
this
decision
to
me
and
i
have
decided
to
the
exclusion
of
all
the
other
cases,
this
is
the
one
that
i
want
you
to
--
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
i
do
not
think
we
can
assume
--
if
we
assume
he
was
wrong
in
saying
it,
we
would
have
a
jury
that
did
not
believe
in
him
and
we
would
not
have
a
death
penalty
case.
i
mean,
he
is
right
in
saying
that
the
legislature
does
give
him
the
authority
because
the
district
attorneys
in
texas
have
the
absolute
authority
to
seek
and
waive
the
death
penalty.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
i
do
not
think
it
is
a
question
of
their
faith
and
it
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
prosecutor
ought
to
have
a
right
to
change
the
range
of
punishment
for
any
reason
that
he
desires.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
well,
your
honor
in
the
state
of
texas,
if
one
is
charged
with
of
burning
of
the
state
capital,
there
is
a
mandatory
death
penalty.
so
--
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
if
i
understand
the
question
correctly,
my
answer
would
be
i
do
not
know
of
any
state
that
does
not
give
the
prosecutor
the
choice.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
because
in
some
other
state
where
the
prosecutor
does
not
have
the
requirement
to
impose
to
file
a
notice,
the
jury
could
override
the
prosecutor's
will
and
still
assess
the
death
penalty.
in
texas
--
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
in
texas,
the
jury
cannot,
once
the
prosecutor
has
given
notice
not
to
seek
the
death
penalty.
the
jury
may
not
assess
the
death
penalty,
if
they
do
it
is
a
void
judgment.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
it
is
a
void
judgment
and
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
would
either
remand
it
or
a
reverse
it.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
that
is
correct.
that
is
correct,
the
full
range
of
punishment
then
applies
and
we
have
briefed
in
the
brief
the
point
that
this
can
be
used
against
identifiable
racial
minority
by
the
prosecutor
and
i
think
it
is
a
valid
consideration
in
support
of
the
fact
that
identifiable
racial
minorities
in
texas
do
receive
the
death
penalty.
the
fact
that
perhaps
whites
and
chicanos
do
not
get
death
penalty
as
frequently
as
blacks
is
due
in
large
part
for
the
fact
that
the
prosecutor
simply
does
not
ask
for
it.
he
will
waive
it,
thinking
that
he
cannot
get
it
or
just
not
wanting
to
get
it
for
any
number
of
good
reasons.
i
do
not
think
that
the
issue
of
capital
punishment
in
a
rape
case
such
as
this
need
to
hang
on
all
the
arguments
made
for
abolition
of
capital
punishment
in
any
case.
i
think
the
opinion
in
ralph
against
warden
clearly
points
out
that
the
infrequency
of
its
use,
the
infrequency
of
its
availability
across
this
nation
indicates
that
it
is
not
a
fit
punishment
and
i
think
that
the
argument
which
would
be
urged
in
support
of
an
equal
protection
argument
or
due
process
argument
would
obtain
in
an
argument
to
show
that
it
was
unusual.
as
far
as
the
question
of
whether
or
not
unusual
should
be
defined
by
new
or
old
standards,
i
would
cite
the
court
to
the
case
mr.
justice
white's
dissent
in
weems
which
is
the
third
objective
of
unusual
--
definition
of
unusual
delayed
downwards
operation
in
usual
prohibition
operates
to
restrain
any
law
making
power
from
endowing
the
judiciary
with
the
right
to
exert
an
legal
discretion
as
to
the
kind
and
extent
of
punishment
to
be
inflicted,
but
that
has
to
be
measured
in
contemporary
terms
by
contemporary
standards,
not
by
standards
of
two
centuries
ago.
otherwise,
the
word
unusual
has
no
meaning
because
it
restricts
by
what
occurred
back
in
the
1700’s.
please
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
argument
for
rebuttal.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
yes
mr.
chief
justice,
a
few
answers.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
asked
about
the
evidence
with
respect
to
the
harm
done
to
prosecute
--
in
a
rape
case
it
has
consistently
been
held
admissible
by
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
as
part
of
the
(inaudible).
i
believe
the
record
in
this
case
shows
that
mrs.
stowe
(ph),
the
complaining
witness
went
to
her
home
with
her
son,
took
a
bath
and
never
even
sought
the
aid
of
the
doctor,
consequently
i
would
assume
from
that
there
was
no
medical
testimony
available
as
the
state
decided
to
put
some
on.
the
answer
is
they
could
have
put
some
on.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
no,
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
consistently
held
that
the
prosecutor's
testimony
concerning
penetration
and
so
forth
is
sufficient
and
need
not
be
collaborated.
in
answer
to
the
other
question
about
the
frequency
of
application
of
article
1
14,
it
is
the
precise
application
of
article
1
14
is
unusual
and
is
not
common
outside
of
the
state
of
texas.
there
are
two
points
that
mr.
wright
has
made,
i
think
there
is
some
searching.
first
of
all
he
says,
professor
amsterdam’s
argument
that
society
is
now
repulsed
by
these
--
of
the
death
penalty
is
refuted
because
the
majority
of
the
states
have
the
death
penalty,
ergo
the
death
penalty
was
acceptable
to
the
majority
of
americans.
however,
no
argument
is
advanced
in
support
of
the
proposition
that
a
minority
of
the
state
has
the
death
penalty
for
rape
only
ergo
it
is
unusual.
i
think
that
the
fact
that
the
minority
of
the
states
have
retained
death
penalty
for
rape
only
leads
to
the
conclusion
drawn
by
the
majority
in
ralph
v.
warden.
the
other
point
that
is
made
by
the
briefs
and
not
made
quite
so
strongly
is
the
fact
that
retribution
is
recognized
by
the
state
of
texas
as
a
very
important
part
of
punishment.
i
would
think
that
it
would
be
extremely
hard
to
justify
retribution
where
the
purpose
of
retribution
is
pure
vengeance.
if
you
have
not
got
a
life
taken,
how
do
you
justify
the
taking
of
life?
are
you
doing
something
greater,
punishing
greater
than
the
crime
itself.
this
is
where
the
proportionality
of
(inaudible)
comes
into
play
and
this
is
where
i
believe
this
court
has
the
right
to
determine
proportionality
of
punishment
and
to
draw
lines
with
respect
to
(inaudible)
and
to
work
out
standards,
and
if
standards
cannot
be
worked
out,
then
in
any
event
to
at
least
send
the
cases
back
to
the
state
legislatures
and
let
them
establish
standards
such
as
nevada
did.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
exactly.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
or
armed
robbery.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
anything
where
there
is
no
real
threat
endangering
the
life
of
the
accused,
to
me
you
are
taking
a
life
for
something
less
that
what
has
occurred.
there
is
absolutely
no
reason
based
on
retribution
in
that
point
and
of
course
the
other
purposes
of
punishment
do
not
apply.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
it
would
be
cruel
and
unusual
in
any
case
except
homicide
or
another
capital
case
where
more
than
simply
showing
a
gun
at
the
victim
is
proved
by
the
state.
i
would
--
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
if
that
was
provable,
i
would
say
that
the
death
penalty
would
not
be
cruel
and
unusual.
texas
--
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
if
it
involves
any
death
or
endangering
any
person,
now
that
is
not
to
say
that
you
may
not
have
more
than
an
immediate
victim.
you
may
have
a
victim
once
or
twice
removed
in
the
case
of
treason,
the
delivery
of
secret
plans
which
may
cost
a
life
of
other
men,
you
would
have
victims
which
are
--
in
fact,
that
they
are
not
dead
or
injured
can
be
shown
from
the
act.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
unless
there
are
facts
but
i
can
see.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
i
can
see
no
real
distinction
between
the
attempt
on
the
president’s
life
and
the
attempt
on
any
person’s
life,
and
unless
there
are
medical
facts
in
a
record
showing
some
sort
of
injury
to
the
person,
i
can
see
no
reason
for
the
taking
of
life.
the
taking
of
life
in
my
opinion
and
i
think
in
the
opinion
of
the
majority
in
the
ralph
case
must
necessarily
depend
upon
the
harm
which
is
done.
the
punishment
must
be
made
to
fit
the
harm
done
not
exceed
it.
to
taking
the
life
--
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
i
am
sorry
i
did
not.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
i
think
very
nicely
because
taking
into
recognition
the
advanced
techniques
that
we
are
now
aware
of
and
that
are
being
used
in
prison
systems,
i
think
sentencing
now
has
become
more
function
of
parole
boards
and
experienced
people
in
the
penitentiary
system.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
or
endanger
to
such
a
degree
that
medical
attention
was
necessary
to
save
the
life.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
under
the
eighth
amendment,
i
see
no
limitation
as
far
as
what
the
legislature
of
the
states
may
do
because
--
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
the
main
thing
is
the
taking
of
the
life.
that
is
the
thing
that
distinguishes
the
rape
case
from
the
murder
case
and
the
rape
case
from
anything.
that
taking
the
life
without
demonstrable
evidence
that
the
taking
of
the
life
is
necessary
and
flows
from
the
act,
it
is
unusual
and
that
may
make
it
cruel
as
well.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
i
did
not
say
necessarily
substantial.
medical
evidence
showing
that
some
harm
had
occurred.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
some
harm
had
occurred,
some
physical
harm
and
that
perhaps
sought
for
medical
attention
that
would
have
been
problems,
how
serious
the
problems
maybe
is
i
do
not
think,
it
may
not
even
be
a
question
for
this
court.
it
may
really
be
a
question
for
the
legislature.
i
think—
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
i
am
sorry
i
should
have
not
excluded
it
no.
if
there
is
testimony
of
some
disorder
of
the
mind
has
resulted
of
it,
i
think
that
would
also
be
a
very
important
factor
whether
or
not
the
death
penalty
was
permissible.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
no,
i
would
draw
a
line
at
some
point.
the
harm
would
have
to
be
of
such
a
nature
that
it
might
lead
to
incapacity
or
even
death.
for
instance,
in
the
branch
case,
the
mere
pressing
of
the
arm
across
the
throat
which
did
not
necessitate
medical
attention,
i
do
not
see
how
that
could
possibly
be
a
serious
crime
such
as
to
justify
the
taking
of
the
life
because
as
i
have
said
originally,
in
texas,
a
man
could
beat
a
woman
to
the
brink
of
death
and
still
only
get
25
years
if
she
recovered,
under
our
assault
statutes.
but
if
he
beat
her
to
the
brink
of
death
and
raped
her,
perhaps
he
could
life.
it
would
be
inconsistent
and
thus
it
might
be
a
question
for
the
texas
legislature
to
resolve
because
of
the
internal
inconsistency
there,
but
i
think
the
necessity
of
drawing
that
line
is
clear
under
the
cruel
and
unusual
provision
of
the
eighth
amendment
and
that
the
least
this
court
should
do
in
this
case
is
to
remand
the
case
so
that
this
line
can
be
drawn
much
as
nevada
did
and
much
has
been
proposed
by
the
model
draft
in
texas
which
has
not
been
enacted.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
there
are
two
interesting
problems.
first
of
all,
you
are
dealing
with
a
non-civilian
and
probably
non
peacetime
crime
and
the
second
problem
is
obviously
how
do
you
show
whether
or
not
that
act
contributed
to
death
or
injury
to
somebody
else.
i
would
think
if
there
is
any
prohibitive
evidence
showing
a
contribution
to
injury
or
death,
the
answer
would
be
yes.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
if
not,
by
using
these
standards,
if
the
standards
apply
to
civilian
peacetime
crimes
and
wartime
military
crimes,
the
answer
would
be
it
would
be
cruel
and
unusual.
