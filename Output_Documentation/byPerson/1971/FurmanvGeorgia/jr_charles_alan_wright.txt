mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
endeavor
not
repeat
arguments
that
have
been
presented
in
the
three
cases
that
have
preceded
and
lend
myself
to
those
points
that
have
not
been
raised
and
i
think
that
it
is
maybe
helpful
to
court.
my
own
analysis
of
the
case
begins
with
the
question
of
the
chief
justice
put
to
mr.
amsterdam,
the
argument
in
the
furman
case,
and
which
i
say
with
respect
i
do
not
think
there
was
a
complete
answer.
chief
justice
pointed
out
that
many
of
the
jurisdictions
that
mr.
amsterdam
and
those
associated
with
him
regards
abolitions
as
jurisdictions
have
in
fact
not
abolished
capital
punishment
entirely.
they
have
preserved
that
extreme
penalty
for
somewhat
unusual
cases.
the
murder
of
a
policeman
or
correction
or
official
or
a
murder
committed
by
a
person
already
serving
a
life
sentence
or
in
english
and
canadian
version
defined
dockyard
arson
or
piracy
with
violence.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
extremely
important
because
if
one
accepts
that
there
is
any
case,
any
crime
for
which
death
is
an
appropriate
punishment,
then
i
think
most
of
the
force
of
the
argument
that
professor
amsterdam
has
made
vanishes.
if
we
were
to
say
it
for
example
as
congress
said
only
seven
years
ago,
that
the
assassination
of
a
president
is
a
crime
so
heinous
that
only
the
death
penalty
is
meet
for
it,
then
i
cannot
see
how
it
can
be
argued
that
the
penalty
is
unconstitutional
merely
because
it
is
a
penalty
that
may
not
be
inflicted
in
a
great
many
cases
because
it
is
somewhat
rare
as
has
been
suggested
to
us
today.
i
would
find
it
very
difficult
to
understand
how
this
court
as
a
constitutional
matter
could
draw
these
kinds
of
shadings
and
distinctions
that
anyone
in
canada
and
new
york
and
some
other
jurisdictions
have
done.
i
do
not
see
how
you
have
read
an
opinion
and
say
we
are
persuaded
that
capital
punishment
is
in
general
cruel
and
unusual,
but
this
does
not
to
dissuade
the
legislature
from
taking
care
of
presidential
assassins
or
bombers
of
747
or
other
very
unusual
people
of
that
kind.
but
since,
the
constitution
necessary
paints
with
a
much
broader
brush
than
a
legislature
can
do
and
court
has
to
respect
these
broad
differentiations,
but
if
then
we
can
say
that
the
presidential
assassins
constitutionally
can
be
executed,
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
established
that
death
is
in
itself
not
inherently
cruel.
now,
there
is
much
more
than
that
in
my
reading
of
the
eighth
amendment,
and
also
as
suggested
in
the
brief
that
--
the
eighth
amendment
bars
those
things
that
are
inherently
cruel
and
perhaps
also
those
things
that
are
cruelly
excessive
and
i
think
of
course,
there
would
still
be
ample
room
to
say
that
the
death
penalty
for
some
particular
crime
maybe
cruelly
excessive,
even
though
we
have
held
that
it
is
not
inherently
cruel
and
said
that
there
are
some
thing’s
to
which
you
can
apply
it.
but
i
do
think
that
we
have
progressed
partly
towards
decision,
if
we
can
recognize
that
the
death
penalty
is
not
at
all
times
for
all
crimes
a
constitutionally
impermissible
punishment
because
--
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
correct.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
i
would
submit
in
response
to
that
justice
stewart
that
perhaps
such
a
position
can
be
made
and
such
an
argument
presented,
but
that
at
least
is
not
the
argument
that
i
have
understood
the
petitioners
in
this
case
to
be
making.
mr.
amsterdam,
the
two
murder
cases
says
that
the
death
is
unconstitutional
for
any
civilian
based
on
crime
and
of
course
the
more
blended
specialized
view
is
taking
of
rape
to
which
i
would
come
in
a
moment,
but
mr.
greenberg
and
mr.
bruder
have,
i
cannot
myself
see
the
constitutional
argument
that
would
say
murders
generally
cannot
be
punished
by
death
and
maybe
we
will
find
some
of
the
constitutionally
it
can,
that
involves
reading
a
certifying
the
intent
of
constitution
that
i
cannot
detect
there.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
that
i
think
is
very
clear,
yes
sir.
but
if
we
have
established
that
the
death
penalty
sometimes
is
constitutional,
it
is
still
open
to
my
friends
to
challenge
any
particular
application
of
it,
requires
a
crime
by
saying
that
you
cannot
do
and
i
am
willing
to
read
weems
with
all
the
problems
it
presents
as
introducing
a
principle
of
proportionality
and
i
would
say
against
petty
larceny,
if
we
chop
the
conscience
of
the
community
where
we
today
would
execute
a
person
who
picks
a
pocket
wherever
it
may
have
been,
our
english
tradition
300
years
ago.
because
in
my
analysis,
the
meaning
of
cruel
and
unusual
is
not
very
likely
to
be
found
in
the
dictionary.
i
do
not
get
great
deal
of
help
in
parsing
the
words.
i
find
that
even
the
history
of
the
words
here
is
less
helpful
than
it
is
in
most
questions
of
constitutional
construction.
it
is
clear
that
they
were
taken
verbatim
from
the
english
declaration
of
rights,
a
century
before.
there
was
some
scholar
who
thought
that
the
american
draftsmen
did
not
understand
what
the
english
meant
by
them.
the
concept
that
the
eighth
amendment
seems
to
me
to
express,
as
chief
justice
said
in
his
plurality
opinion,
“yes,
that
we
are
not
going
to
rule
out
in
human
treatment”
and
i
would
say
that
the
kinds
of
things
we
will
not
allow
are
those
that
the
common
conscience
of
america
rejects.
my
own
guess
is
even
if
the
eighth
amendment
had
never
been
adopted,
that
this
court
would
not
uphold
the
sentence
that
man
be
boiled
in
oil.
i
think
that
under
the
due
process
clause,
it
was
impossible
to
say
that
taking
his
life
away
without
due
process
of
law
and
i
think
that
just
as
due
process
has
always
been
a
very
difficult
concept
to
interpret,
so
cruel
and
unusual
is
going
to
be.
it
is
not
easy
for
non-abuse
on
that
side
of
the
bench
to
decide
what
it
is
that
the
common
conscience
of
america
regards
as
meet,
what
it
regards
as
improper.
i
do
not
think
that
this
is
as
mr.
amsterdam
suggests
to
say
that
this
is
a
subjective
determination.
it
would
be
subjective
if
the
justices
were
free
to
say
i
think
death
and
any
other
penalty
is
bad,
therefore,
it
is
unconstitutional,
but
that
is
not
all
the
same
question
as
asking
yourself
to
ascertain
as
best
as
you
can
what
it
is
that
conscience
of
the
whole
country
permits
rather
that
relying
on
your
own
individual
judgments.
i
think
that
if
you
do
ask
what
i
visualize
as
the
proper
question
but
the
answer
has
to
be
that
whatever
the
future
may
hold,
the
capital
punishment
today
is
tolerated,
accepted
by
the
conscience
of
america
and
this
is
shown
not
only
by
the
statutes
on
the
books,
by
the
votes
of
jurors,
by
votes
and
referendums,
by
poles,
by
the
very
fact
that
we
have
so
much
to
debate
about
it.
with
all
the
fervor,
the
crusade
that
has
been
waged
with
to
abolish
capital
punishment,
there
is
still
the
nos
who
insist
no
at
this
time
in
society,
we
need
this,
we
think
it
is
a
superior
deterrent
that
we
recognize,
we
can
prove
that
statistically.
we
think
that
it
does
provide
a
sense
of
expression
in
the
community’s
moral
outrage
that
it
helps
make
a
more
peaceful
society
than
a
community
has
to
take
the
law
in
its
own
hands.
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
understand,
but
merely
because
we
do
not
execute
great
many
people
every
week,
but
this
in
someway
show
that
america
has
now
rejected
capital
punishment.
i
would
think
that
it
would
be
cause
for
rejoicing,
but
we
become
increasingly
selective
about
imposing
the
ultimate
and
most
severe
penalty.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
it
would
not
trouble
me
justice
white
under
the
cruel
and
unusual
clause.
it
will
trouble
me
immensely
under
the
due
process
clause.
it
seems
to
me
it's
mcgautha
all
over
again.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
no
not
sir
under
cruel
and
unusual,
it
would
under
the
process,
it
would
under
equal
protection.
it
would
seem
to
me
arbitrary
if
a
hundred
similarly
circumstances
defendants
are
convicted,
and
99
of
them
go
to
prison
and
one
selected
by
law
for
process
not
than
executed.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
unless
it
came
to
the
point
that
you
put
hypothetically
that
we
could
satisfy
ourselves
that
the
people
simply
would
not
tolerate
imposition
of
the
punishment
more
widely
that
they
would
be
as
my
friends
argue
revolt
it
if
we
executed
even
a
reasonable
proportion
of
all
rapists
and
murderers.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
i
would
rather
phrase
it
this
way
that
i
do
not
know
how
we
can
ascertain
whether
or
not
we
have
reached
that
point.
i
do
not
know
how
we
can
say.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
it
is
certainly
one
of
these
ingredients
justice
douglas.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
i
would
submit
that
it
is
not
the
only
ingredient.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
for
myself
sir,
i
would
still
prefer
not
to
rest
out
on
the
eighth
amendment.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
so
clear
constitutional
barriers
to
that
elsewhere.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
and
i
don't
think
that
proper
guides
have
suggested
and
i
agree
that
it
is
one
of
the
elements
in
the
eighth
amendment
concept
of
unusualness.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
on
the
overall
figures
of
number
of
executions,
i
simply
do
not,
the
racial
aspect
poses
a
separate
problem
that
i
would
like
to
come
to
in
a
moment.
in
the
first
place,
i
cannot
use
the
figures
for
the
last
ten
years.
it
seems
to
me
there
has
been
too
many
intervening
events
that
makes
those
figures
unreliable.
i
would
say
you
would
have
to
go
back
to
years
such
as
1962
or
earlier,
in
order
to
have
a
figure
that
is
more
meaningful.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
they
would
show
an
increasingly
infrequent
use
of
capital
punishment.
whether
they
would
show
as
professor
amsterdam
argues,
if
we
use
that
infrequently
because
people
would
be
revolted
if
we
used
it
more
frequently,
i
cannot
say.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
aspect
of
his
argument
is
assertion.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
no,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
several
of
my
associates
suggested
that
the
burden
is
on
those
who
are
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
state
legislation
to
establish
that
it
violates
the
constitution.
they
need
to
demonstrate
that
the
common
conscience
will
not
accept
this.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
yes
that
is
what
is
fit
to
that.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
well,
i
still
do
not
see
how
the
figures
establish
the
second
part,
they
do
not
establish
what
the
cause
is,
just
is
like.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
rarity
as
i
have
suggested
i
think
one
element
of
the
eighth
amendment
problem
but
it
is
not
the
only
element,
we
need
more,
we
need
to
know
more
that
we
can
than
we
do
know.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
that
is
precisely
my
submission
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
i
guess
that
this
court
would
have
found
the
cadena
temporal
to
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment,
no
matter
how
frequently
it
is
imposed
to
control
things.
that
it
was
the
quality,
the
nature
of
the
punishment
that
was
so
shocking
to
a
court
that
it
has
grown
up
and
used
to
other
concept
of
punishment.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
no,
it
was
the
punishment
that
was
involved
in
the
weems
v.
united
states
in
which
it
simply
poses
a
number
of
disabilities
on
a
person
in
essence
that
it
is
not
physically
cruel
to
him.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
i
would
say
certainly
it
is
yes
and
i
feel
i
can
see
one
of
the
--
i
must
have
just
missed
upon
it,
that
we
do
have
changing
concepts
here,
but
what
is
cruel
and
inhuman
is
not
a
static
concept,
but
it
for
example
tomorrow,
someone
were
to
have
been
done
away
of
executing,
condemned
people
that
was
far
superior
to
the
methods
now
used
in
the
united
states,
so
far
superior
that
they
bore
no
comparison,
i
think
that
it
might
be
said
that
it
is
cruel
to
continue
use
the
electric
chair
if
you
now
have
this
marvelous
new
invention
available.
the
constitution,
though
the
constitution
itself
does
not
change
in
response
to
change
in
circumstances
unless
to
be
applied
to
particular
context.
i
would
like
to
turn
if
i
may
to
the
racial
aspect
of
these
cases
particularly
if
they
apply
in
the
rape
cases.
the
figures
are
undoubtedly
very
troubling.
the
figures
from
georgia
i
think
perhaps
better
than
those
from
the
place
of
texas
but
utmost
from
georgia,
but
still
anyone
reading
the
various
statistics
that
97
persons
executed
for
rape
in
texas,
80
had
been
negro.
if
i
am
to
be
considerably
worried
that
racial
prejudice
has
played
its
part
and
i
think
it
would
be
disingenuous
deny
that
over
the
47-year
period
covered
by
those
figures,
probably
it
did.
as
pointed
out
in
our
brief
until
1954,
segregation
was
a
crime
in
texas
and
undoubtedly
an
interracial
rape
was
thought
to
be
a
particular
traumatic
event,
particularly
great
disturbance
of
the
peace
of
the
state
and
therefore
likely
to
be
punished
more
severely.
the
figures
are
small
being
the
total
number
of
cases
of
this
kind
it
is
sufficiently
small,
but
whether
we
look
only
to
the
rapes
or
even
to
the
murders
as
mr.
amsterdam
concedes
in
his
brief,
but
it
is
very
difficult
to
form
any
firm
statistical
conclusion
firmly.
this
at
least
has
been
the
view
of
both
fourth
circuit
and
eighth
circuit.
you
cannot
be
more
than
suspicious
in
the
figures.
there
is
i
think
an
explanation
one
may
not
be
happy
to
make,
but
the
history
requires
that
we
make
about
the
incidence
of
the
death
penalty
in
an
earlier
time
in
my
state
with
the
customs
that
it
one
time
had.
and,
i
think
that
finally,
it
would
be
little
up
to
me
that
is
a
very
important
principle
that
race
is
utterly
irrelevant
in
sentencing
convicted
persons.
if
we
were
to
bring
that
principle
in
today,
rape
cases
under
the
eighth
amendment
and
say
yes
we
think
that
race
has
been
impermissibly
used
in
texas
and
georgia
in
the
past,
therefore,
we
are
going
to
outlaw
the
death
penalty
for
rape
cases.
to
the
extent
that
there
is
prejudice
among
those
who
impose
sentence
whether
it
be
jurors
who
sentence
or
judges
who
sentence
or
prosecutors
who
make
the
initial
choice
of
going
to
the
death
penalty
or
not
or
going
to
the
other
crime,
to
the
extent
that
there
is
prejudice,
that
prejudice
is
going
to
appear
not
only
in
cases
in
which
death
is
the
sentence
but
in
which
other
sentences
are
given.
professor
bullock’s
study
cited
in
our
brief
of
persons
who
were
given
prison
sentences
shows
that
that
is
so,
but
among
those
given
prison
sentences
for
rape
are
figures
that
make
us
wonder
if
race
was
impermissibly
taken
into
account
by
texas
jurors
and
in
years
past,
it
seems
to
me
that
we
honor
the
principle
on
which
all
of
us
would
agree
much
better.
if
we
regard
these
as
being
as
they
really
are
equal
protection
argument.
it
is
a
denial
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
if
a
man
because
of
his
color
suffers
a
different
punishment
than
someone
else
with
a
different
color,
we
agree
this
violation
of
the
constitution
but
i
think
that
that
is
what
we
are
facing
squarely
rather.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
i
suggest
justice
stewart
that
you
can
do
what
as
mr.
greenburg
has
told
us
has
been
done
in
schools
and
other
things
where
equal
protection
argument
is
made,
you
bring
forth
statistics,
you
make
a
prima
facie
showing
and
you
say
to
the
state
can
you
justify?
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
i
would
think
of
it
certainly,
it
would
have
something
to
do
with
an
injection
on
this
ground
just
as
the
fact
that
a
particular
jury
is
alright.
maybe
challenged
and
when
they
go
back
in
the
past
history
and
show
what
historical
practice
has
been
in
order
to
establish
a
pattern
of
discrimination.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
well,
it
might
lead
one
to
conclude
that
we
ought
not
allow
the
present
practices
that
we
have
for
sentencing.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
no,
of
course
it
would
not
be
like
that.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
you
might
have
to
reexamine
your
decisions
of
last
term
in
the
goff
(ph)
and
compton
(ph),
goff
in
particular.
i
think
you
might
have
to
see
if
jury
sentencing
is
a
permissible
method
or
whether
jury
sentencing
is
not
so
suspect
because
of
the
likelihood,
the
bias
will
play
a
part
that
you
have
to
take
this
far
away
from
juries,
but
the
court
having
decided
so
recently
and
so
decisively
that
the
jury
sentencing
is
proper
but
the
jury
does
express
the
confidence
in
the
community.
i
would
think
it
needs
quite
a
powerful
showing
to
change
the
court's
mind.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
oh
that
it
is
certainly
the
question
yes.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
absolutely,
that
seems
to
me
properly
what
the
parties
are
here.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
this
is
what
this
case
is
all
about.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
my
argument
first
goes
that
one
can
or
a
state
legislature
reasonably
can
say
that
there
are
some
rapes
sufficiently
serious,
but
for
purposes
of
retribution
and
deterrence
the
state
ought
to
be
allowed
to
provide
the
death
penalty.
but
it
would
be
not
familiar
in
the
extreme
to
say
that
no
rape
is
so
bad
we
can
take
the
very
end
of
the
case
as
justice
marshal
put
to
counsel
in
the
case
preceding,
i
suppose
we
have
the
rape
victim
who
is
traumatized
for
life
and
a
cripple
psychologically
as
a
result
of
this
experience
that
the
legislature
would
not
be
acting
irrationally
or
improperly
to
say
that
for
this
kind,
a
very
serious
case,
death
is
not
an
appropriate
penalty.
if
that
is
so,
then
the
question
becomes
can
one
constitutionally
draw
a
line
to
separate
some
rapes
from
others.
i
think
that
everyone
of
us
would
be
horrified
if
every
rapist
were
given
the
death
penalty
because
some
rapes
as
justice
stewart
has
suggested
earlier
are
not
aggravated
affairs
or
in
any
sense.
this
is
what
the
fourth
circuit
has
undertaken
in
ralph
v.
warden.
i
think
that
the
position
taken
there
by
the
majorities
speaking
for
judge
butsner,
that
you
can
impose
death
only
for
rapes
in
which
life
has
been
in
danger
is
a
wholly
unworkable
position,
that
life
is
endangered
in
substantially
any
rape
and
that
this
would
become
a
question
of
very
arbitrary
proof
to
develop
that
line
in
our
brief,
i
cannot
repeat
what
was
said
there.
clearly
there
is
more
for
us
to
the
position
taken
by
chief
judge
hangward
(ph)
in
the
fourth
circuit
that
you
can
impose
death
for
rapes
only
if
serious
physical
or
psychological
harm
as
a
result.
this
is
at
least
the
more
objective
test.
my
difficulties
were
two.
first,
i
think
that
in
the
present
imperfections
of
knowledge
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
say
with
confidence
whether
or
not
serious
psychological
harm
has
resulted.
second,
i
cannot
think
that
the
constitution
permits
drawing
of
lines
with
that
reforms.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
not
justice
rehnquist
and
that
is
why
there
was
no
record
of
it
here
that
the
fact
is
that
the
rape
occurred
and
how
it
occurred
that
was
enough
to
establish
a
complete
case
under
texas
law
therefore
it
never
occurred
to
anyone
to
put
on
evidence
one
way
or
the
other
whether
or
not
mrs.
stowe
(ph)
suffered
any
harm.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
i
would
--
i
would
be
hard
put
mr.
chief
justice
to
form
a
judgment
on
whether
overall
it
is
a
good
thing
or
a
bad
thing
for
a
criminal
defendant
to
have
a
jury
trial.
i
take
it
that
the
sixth
amendment
is
simply
to
present
the
ways
to
resolve
the
position,
they
all
have
one
if
you
want
one.
i
do
think
that
there
is
a
possibility
of
prejudice
not
only
racial
grounds
and
other
grounds,
when
you
have
a
jury
setting
the
sentence
and
perhaps
judges
can
be
better
disciplined
and
less
likely
to
do
that,
but
i
note
that
the
pressure
is
now
for
appellate
review
of
sentences
in
the
federal
system
where
we
do
not
use
jury
sentencing
so
that
i
guess
that
even
judges
are
hardly
acting
scientifically.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
true.
that
is
the
argument
of
justice
white.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
i
would
say
that
it
was
successful,
whether
we
need
jury
sentencing
today
to
achieve
that
purpose
given
our
advances
in
other
logical
matters
--
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
oh
yes.
yes.
thank
you.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
endeavor
not
repeat
arguments
that
have
been
presented
in
the
three
cases
that
have
preceded
and
lend
myself
to
those
points
that
have
not
been
raised
and
i
think
that
it
is
maybe
helpful
to
court.
my
own
analysis
of
the
case
begins
with
the
question
of
the
chief
justice
put
to
mr.
amsterdam,
the
argument
in
the
furman
case,
and
which
i
say
with
respect
i
do
not
think
there
was
a
complete
answer.
chief
justice
pointed
out
that
many
of
the
jurisdictions
that
mr.
amsterdam
and
those
associated
with
him
regards
abolitions
as
jurisdictions
have
in
fact
not
abolished
capital
punishment
entirely.
they
have
preserved
that
extreme
penalty
for
somewhat
unusual
cases.
the
murder
of
a
policeman
or
correction
or
official
or
a
murder
committed
by
a
person
already
serving
a
life
sentence
or
in
english
and
canadian
version
defined
dockyard
arson
or
piracy
with
violence.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
extremely
important
because
if
one
accepts
that
there
is
any
case,
any
crime
for
which
death
is
an
appropriate
punishment,
then
i
think
most
of
the
force
of
the
argument
that
professor
amsterdam
has
made
vanishes.
if
we
were
to
say
it
for
example
as
congress
said
only
seven
years
ago,
that
the
assassination
of
a
president
is
a
crime
so
heinous
that
only
the
death
penalty
is
meet
for
it,
then
i
cannot
see
how
it
can
be
argued
that
the
penalty
is
unconstitutional
merely
because
it
is
a
penalty
that
may
not
be
inflicted
in
a
great
many
cases
because
it
is
somewhat
rare
as
has
been
suggested
to
us
today.
i
would
find
it
very
difficult
to
understand
how
this
court
as
a
constitutional
matter
could
draw
these
kinds
of
shadings
and
distinctions
that
anyone
in
canada
and
new
york
and
some
other
jurisdictions
have
done.
i
do
not
see
how
you
have
read
an
opinion
and
say
we
are
persuaded
that
capital
punishment
is
in
general
cruel
and
unusual,
but
this
does
not
to
dissuade
the
legislature
from
taking
care
of
presidential
assassins
or
bombers
of
747
or
other
very
unusual
people
of
that
kind.
but
since,
the
constitution
necessary
paints
with
a
much
broader
brush
than
a
legislature
can
do
and
court
has
to
respect
these
broad
differentiations,
but
if
then
we
can
say
that
the
presidential
assassins
constitutionally
can
be
executed,
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
established
that
death
is
in
itself
not
inherently
cruel.
now,
there
is
much
more
than
that
in
my
reading
of
the
eighth
amendment,
and
also
as
suggested
in
the
brief
that
--
the
eighth
amendment
bars
those
things
that
are
inherently
cruel
and
perhaps
also
those
things
that
are
cruelly
excessive
and
i
think
of
course,
there
would
still
be
ample
room
to
say
that
the
death
penalty
for
some
particular
crime
maybe
cruelly
excessive,
even
though
we
have
held
that
it
is
not
inherently
cruel
and
said
that
there
are
some
thing’s
to
which
you
can
apply
it.
but
i
do
think
that
we
have
progressed
partly
towards
decision,
if
we
can
recognize
that
the
death
penalty
is
not
at
all
times
for
all
crimes
a
constitutionally
impermissible
punishment
because
--
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
correct.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
i
would
submit
in
response
to
that
justice
stewart
that
perhaps
such
a
position
can
be
made
and
such
an
argument
presented,
but
that
at
least
is
not
the
argument
that
i
have
understood
the
petitioners
in
this
case
to
be
making.
mr.
amsterdam,
the
two
murder
cases
says
that
the
death
is
unconstitutional
for
any
civilian
based
on
crime
and
of
course
the
more
blended
specialized
view
is
taking
of
rape
to
which
i
would
come
in
a
moment,
but
mr.
greenberg
and
mr.
bruder
have,
i
cannot
myself
see
the
constitutional
argument
that
would
say
murders
generally
cannot
be
punished
by
death
and
maybe
we
will
find
some
of
the
constitutionally
it
can,
that
involves
reading
a
certifying
the
intent
of
constitution
that
i
cannot
detect
there.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
that
i
think
is
very
clear,
yes
sir.
but
if
we
have
established
that
the
death
penalty
sometimes
is
constitutional,
it
is
still
open
to
my
friends
to
challenge
any
particular
application
of
it,
requires
a
crime
by
saying
that
you
cannot
do
and
i
am
willing
to
read
weems
with
all
the
problems
it
presents
as
introducing
a
principle
of
proportionality
and
i
would
say
against
petty
larceny,
if
we
chop
the
conscience
of
the
community
where
we
today
would
execute
a
person
who
picks
a
pocket
wherever
it
may
have
been,
our
english
tradition
300
years
ago.
because
in
my
analysis,
the
meaning
of
cruel
and
unusual
is
not
very
likely
to
be
found
in
the
dictionary.
i
do
not
get
great
deal
of
help
in
parsing
the
words.
i
find
that
even
the
history
of
the
words
here
is
less
helpful
than
it
is
in
most
questions
of
constitutional
construction.
it
is
clear
that
they
were
taken
verbatim
from
the
english
declaration
of
rights,
a
century
before.
there
was
some
scholar
who
thought
that
the
american
draftsmen
did
not
understand
what
the
english
meant
by
them.
the
concept
that
the
eighth
amendment
seems
to
me
to
express,
as
chief
justice
said
in
his
plurality
opinion,
“yes,
that
we
are
not
going
to
rule
out
in
human
treatment”
and
i
would
say
that
the
kinds
of
things
we
will
not
allow
are
those
that
the
common
conscience
of
america
rejects.
my
own
guess
is
even
if
the
eighth
amendment
had
never
been
adopted,
that
this
court
would
not
uphold
the
sentence
that
man
be
boiled
in
oil.
i
think
that
under
the
due
process
clause,
it
was
impossible
to
say
that
taking
his
life
away
without
due
process
of
law
and
i
think
that
just
as
due
process
has
always
been
a
very
difficult
concept
to
interpret,
so
cruel
and
unusual
is
going
to
be.
it
is
not
easy
for
non-abuse
on
that
side
of
the
bench
to
decide
what
it
is
that
the
common
conscience
of
america
regards
as
meet,
what
it
regards
as
improper.
i
do
not
think
that
this
is
as
mr.
amsterdam
suggests
to
say
that
this
is
a
subjective
determination.
it
would
be
subjective
if
the
justices
were
free
to
say
i
think
death
and
any
other
penalty
is
bad,
therefore,
it
is
unconstitutional,
but
that
is
not
all
the
same
question
as
asking
yourself
to
ascertain
as
best
as
you
can
what
it
is
that
conscience
of
the
whole
country
permits
rather
that
relying
on
your
own
individual
judgments.
i
think
that
if
you
do
ask
what
i
visualize
as
the
proper
question
but
the
answer
has
to
be
that
whatever
the
future
may
hold,
the
capital
punishment
today
is
tolerated,
accepted
by
the
conscience
of
america
and
this
is
shown
not
only
by
the
statutes
on
the
books,
by
the
votes
of
jurors,
by
votes
and
referendums,
by
poles,
by
the
very
fact
that
we
have
so
much
to
debate
about
it.
with
all
the
fervor,
the
crusade
that
has
been
waged
with
to
abolish
capital
punishment,
there
is
still
the
nos
who
insist
no
at
this
time
in
society,
we
need
this,
we
think
it
is
a
superior
deterrent
that
we
recognize,
we
can
prove
that
statistically.
we
think
that
it
does
provide
a
sense
of
expression
in
the
community’s
moral
outrage
that
it
helps
make
a
more
peaceful
society
than
a
community
has
to
take
the
law
in
its
own
hands.
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
understand,
but
merely
because
we
do
not
execute
great
many
people
every
week,
but
this
in
someway
show
that
america
has
now
rejected
capital
punishment.
i
would
think
that
it
would
be
cause
for
rejoicing,
but
we
become
increasingly
selective
about
imposing
the
ultimate
and
most
severe
penalty.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
it
would
not
trouble
me
justice
white
under
the
cruel
and
unusual
clause.
it
will
trouble
me
immensely
under
the
due
process
clause.
it
seems
to
me
it's
mcgautha
all
over
again.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
no
not
sir
under
cruel
and
unusual,
it
would
under
the
process,
it
would
under
equal
protection.
it
would
seem
to
me
arbitrary
if
a
hundred
similarly
circumstances
defendants
are
convicted,
and
99
of
them
go
to
prison
and
one
selected
by
law
for
process
not
than
executed.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
unless
it
came
to
the
point
that
you
put
hypothetically
that
we
could
satisfy
ourselves
that
the
people
simply
would
not
tolerate
imposition
of
the
punishment
more
widely
that
they
would
be
as
my
friends
argue
revolt
it
if
we
executed
even
a
reasonable
proportion
of
all
rapists
and
murderers.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
i
would
rather
phrase
it
this
way
that
i
do
not
know
how
we
can
ascertain
whether
or
not
we
have
reached
that
point.
i
do
not
know
how
we
can
say.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
it
is
certainly
one
of
these
ingredients
justice
douglas.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
i
would
submit
that
it
is
not
the
only
ingredient.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
for
myself
sir,
i
would
still
prefer
not
to
rest
out
on
the
eighth
amendment.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
so
clear
constitutional
barriers
to
that
elsewhere.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
and
i
don't
think
that
proper
guides
have
suggested
and
i
agree
that
it
is
one
of
the
elements
in
the
eighth
amendment
concept
of
unusualness.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
on
the
overall
figures
of
number
of
executions,
i
simply
do
not,
the
racial
aspect
poses
a
separate
problem
that
i
would
like
to
come
to
in
a
moment.
in
the
first
place,
i
cannot
use
the
figures
for
the
last
ten
years.
it
seems
to
me
there
has
been
too
many
intervening
events
that
makes
those
figures
unreliable.
i
would
say
you
would
have
to
go
back
to
years
such
as
1962
or
earlier,
in
order
to
have
a
figure
that
is
more
meaningful.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
they
would
show
an
increasingly
infrequent
use
of
capital
punishment.
whether
they
would
show
as
professor
amsterdam
argues,
if
we
use
that
infrequently
because
people
would
be
revolted
if
we
used
it
more
frequently,
i
cannot
say.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
aspect
of
his
argument
is
assertion.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
no,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
several
of
my
associates
suggested
that
the
burden
is
on
those
who
are
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
state
legislation
to
establish
that
it
violates
the
constitution.
they
need
to
demonstrate
that
the
common
conscience
will
not
accept
this.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
yes
that
is
what
is
fit
to
that.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
well,
i
still
do
not
see
how
the
figures
establish
the
second
part,
they
do
not
establish
what
the
cause
is,
just
is
like.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
rarity
as
i
have
suggested
i
think
one
element
of
the
eighth
amendment
problem
but
it
is
not
the
only
element,
we
need
more,
we
need
to
know
more
that
we
can
than
we
do
know.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
that
is
precisely
my
submission
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
i
guess
that
this
court
would
have
found
the
cadena
temporal
to
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment,
no
matter
how
frequently
it
is
imposed
to
control
things.
that
it
was
the
quality,
the
nature
of
the
punishment
that
was
so
shocking
to
a
court
that
it
has
grown
up
and
used
to
other
concept
of
punishment.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
no,
it
was
the
punishment
that
was
involved
in
the
weems
v.
united
states
in
which
it
simply
poses
a
number
of
disabilities
on
a
person
in
essence
that
it
is
not
physically
cruel
to
him.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
i
would
say
certainly
it
is
yes
and
i
feel
i
can
see
one
of
the
--
i
must
have
just
missed
upon
it,
that
we
do
have
changing
concepts
here,
but
what
is
cruel
and
inhuman
is
not
a
static
concept,
but
it
for
example
tomorrow,
someone
were
to
have
been
done
away
of
executing,
condemned
people
that
was
far
superior
to
the
methods
now
used
in
the
united
states,
so
far
superior
that
they
bore
no
comparison,
i
think
that
it
might
be
said
that
it
is
cruel
to
continue
use
the
electric
chair
if
you
now
have
this
marvelous
new
invention
available.
the
constitution,
though
the
constitution
itself
does
not
change
in
response
to
change
in
circumstances
unless
to
be
applied
to
particular
context.
i
would
like
to
turn
if
i
may
to
the
racial
aspect
of
these
cases
particularly
if
they
apply
in
the
rape
cases.
the
figures
are
undoubtedly
very
troubling.
the
figures
from
georgia
i
think
perhaps
better
than
those
from
the
place
of
texas
but
utmost
from
georgia,
but
still
anyone
reading
the
various
statistics
that
97
persons
executed
for
rape
in
texas,
80
had
been
negro.
if
i
am
to
be
considerably
worried
that
racial
prejudice
has
played
its
part
and
i
think
it
would
be
disingenuous
deny
that
over
the
47-year
period
covered
by
those
figures,
probably
it
did.
as
pointed
out
in
our
brief
until
1954,
segregation
was
a
crime
in
texas
and
undoubtedly
an
interracial
rape
was
thought
to
be
a
particular
traumatic
event,
particularly
great
disturbance
of
the
peace
of
the
state
and
therefore
likely
to
be
punished
more
severely.
the
figures
are
small
being
the
total
number
of
cases
of
this
kind
it
is
sufficiently
small,
but
whether
we
look
only
to
the
rapes
or
even
to
the
murders
as
mr.
amsterdam
concedes
in
his
brief,
but
it
is
very
difficult
to
form
any
firm
statistical
conclusion
firmly.
this
at
least
has
been
the
view
of
both
fourth
circuit
and
eighth
circuit.
you
cannot
be
more
than
suspicious
in
the
figures.
there
is
i
think
an
explanation
one
may
not
be
happy
to
make,
but
the
history
requires
that
we
make
about
the
incidence
of
the
death
penalty
in
an
earlier
time
in
my
state
with
the
customs
that
it
one
time
had.
and,
i
think
that
finally,
it
would
be
little
up
to
me
that
is
a
very
important
principle
that
race
is
utterly
irrelevant
in
sentencing
convicted
persons.
if
we
were
to
bring
that
principle
in
today,
rape
cases
under
the
eighth
amendment
and
say
yes
we
think
that
race
has
been
impermissibly
used
in
texas
and
georgia
in
the
past,
therefore,
we
are
going
to
outlaw
the
death
penalty
for
rape
cases.
to
the
extent
that
there
is
prejudice
among
those
who
impose
sentence
whether
it
be
jurors
who
sentence
or
judges
who
sentence
or
prosecutors
who
make
the
initial
choice
of
going
to
the
death
penalty
or
not
or
going
to
the
other
crime,
to
the
extent
that
there
is
prejudice,
that
prejudice
is
going
to
appear
not
only
in
cases
in
which
death
is
the
sentence
but
in
which
other
sentences
are
given.
professor
bullock’s
study
cited
in
our
brief
of
persons
who
were
given
prison
sentences
shows
that
that
is
so,
but
among
those
given
prison
sentences
for
rape
are
figures
that
make
us
wonder
if
race
was
impermissibly
taken
into
account
by
texas
jurors
and
in
years
past,
it
seems
to
me
that
we
honor
the
principle
on
which
all
of
us
would
agree
much
better.
if
we
regard
these
as
being
as
they
really
are
equal
protection
argument.
it
is
a
denial
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
if
a
man
because
of
his
color
suffers
a
different
punishment
than
someone
else
with
a
different
color,
we
agree
this
violation
of
the
constitution
but
i
think
that
that
is
what
we
are
facing
squarely
rather.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
i
suggest
justice
stewart
that
you
can
do
what
as
mr.
greenburg
has
told
us
has
been
done
in
schools
and
other
things
where
equal
protection
argument
is
made,
you
bring
forth
statistics,
you
make
a
prima
facie
showing
and
you
say
to
the
state
can
you
justify?
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
i
would
think
of
it
certainly,
it
would
have
something
to
do
with
an
injection
on
this
ground
just
as
the
fact
that
a
particular
jury
is
alright.
maybe
challenged
and
when
they
go
back
in
the
past
history
and
show
what
historical
practice
has
been
in
order
to
establish
a
pattern
of
discrimination.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
well,
it
might
lead
one
to
conclude
that
we
ought
not
allow
the
present
practices
that
we
have
for
sentencing.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
no,
of
course
it
would
not
be
like
that.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
you
might
have
to
reexamine
your
decisions
of
last
term
in
the
goff
(ph)
and
compton
(ph),
goff
in
particular.
i
think
you
might
have
to
see
if
jury
sentencing
is
a
permissible
method
or
whether
jury
sentencing
is
not
so
suspect
because
of
the
likelihood,
the
bias
will
play
a
part
that
you
have
to
take
this
far
away
from
juries,
but
the
court
having
decided
so
recently
and
so
decisively
that
the
jury
sentencing
is
proper
but
the
jury
does
express
the
confidence
in
the
community.
i
would
think
it
needs
quite
a
powerful
showing
to
change
the
court's
mind.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
oh
that
it
is
certainly
the
question
yes.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
absolutely,
that
seems
to
me
properly
what
the
parties
are
here.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
this
is
what
this
case
is
all
about.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
my
argument
first
goes
that
one
can
or
a
state
legislature
reasonably
can
say
that
there
are
some
rapes
sufficiently
serious,
but
for
purposes
of
retribution
and
deterrence
the
state
ought
to
be
allowed
to
provide
the
death
penalty.
but
it
would
be
not
familiar
in
the
extreme
to
say
that
no
rape
is
so
bad
we
can
take
the
very
end
of
the
case
as
justice
marshal
put
to
counsel
in
the
case
preceding,
i
suppose
we
have
the
rape
victim
who
is
traumatized
for
life
and
a
cripple
psychologically
as
a
result
of
this
experience
that
the
legislature
would
not
be
acting
irrationally
or
improperly
to
say
that
for
this
kind,
a
very
serious
case,
death
is
not
an
appropriate
penalty.
if
that
is
so,
then
the
question
becomes
can
one
constitutionally
draw
a
line
to
separate
some
rapes
from
others.
i
think
that
everyone
of
us
would
be
horrified
if
every
rapist
were
given
the
death
penalty
because
some
rapes
as
justice
stewart
has
suggested
earlier
are
not
aggravated
affairs
or
in
any
sense.
this
is
what
the
fourth
circuit
has
undertaken
in
ralph
v.
warden.
i
think
that
the
position
taken
there
by
the
majorities
speaking
for
judge
butsner,
that
you
can
impose
death
only
for
rapes
in
which
life
has
been
in
danger
is
a
wholly
unworkable
position,
that
life
is
endangered
in
substantially
any
rape
and
that
this
would
become
a
question
of
very
arbitrary
proof
to
develop
that
line
in
our
brief,
i
cannot
repeat
what
was
said
there.
clearly
there
is
more
for
us
to
the
position
taken
by
chief
judge
hangward
(ph)
in
the
fourth
circuit
that
you
can
impose
death
for
rapes
only
if
serious
physical
or
psychological
harm
as
a
result.
this
is
at
least
the
more
objective
test.
my
difficulties
were
two.
first,
i
think
that
in
the
present
imperfections
of
knowledge
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
say
with
confidence
whether
or
not
serious
psychological
harm
has
resulted.
second,
i
cannot
think
that
the
constitution
permits
drawing
of
lines
with
that
reforms.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
not
justice
rehnquist
and
that
is
why
there
was
no
record
of
it
here
that
the
fact
is
that
the
rape
occurred
and
how
it
occurred
that
was
enough
to
establish
a
complete
case
under
texas
law
therefore
it
never
occurred
to
anyone
to
put
on
evidence
one
way
or
the
other
whether
or
not
mrs.
stowe
(ph)
suffered
any
harm.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
i
would
--
i
would
be
hard
put
mr.
chief
justice
to
form
a
judgment
on
whether
overall
it
is
a
good
thing
or
a
bad
thing
for
a
criminal
defendant
to
have
a
jury
trial.
i
take
it
that
the
sixth
amendment
is
simply
to
present
the
ways
to
resolve
the
position,
they
all
have
one
if
you
want
one.
i
do
think
that
there
is
a
possibility
of
prejudice
not
only
racial
grounds
and
other
grounds,
when
you
have
a
jury
setting
the
sentence
and
perhaps
judges
can
be
better
disciplined
and
less
likely
to
do
that,
but
i
note
that
the
pressure
is
now
for
appellate
review
of
sentences
in
the
federal
system
where
we
do
not
use
jury
sentencing
so
that
i
guess
that
even
judges
are
hardly
acting
scientifically.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
true.
that
is
the
argument
of
justice
white.
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
i
would
say
that
it
was
successful,
whether
we
need
jury
sentencing
today
to
achieve
that
purpose
given
our
advances
in
other
logical
matters
--
mr.
jr.
charles
alan
wright
oh
yes.
yes.
thank
you.
