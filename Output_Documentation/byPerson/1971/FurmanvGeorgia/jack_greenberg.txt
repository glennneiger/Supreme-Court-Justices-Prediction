mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
hereon
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
and
it
raises
in
another
context
the
questions
of
the
preceding
case
and
that
is
whether
the
imposition
in
carrying
out
of
the
death
penalty
in
the
case
that
one
convicted
of
the
crime
of
rape
constitutes
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
in
violation
of
the
eight
and
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution.
a
petitioner,
lucious
jackson
was
sentenced
to
death
for
the
crime
of
rape
by
the
superior
court
of
chatham
county
georgia
in
1968.
his
conviction
was
upheld
by
the
state
supreme
court
against
eight
and
fourteenth
amendment
policies.
petitioner
was
21
year
old,
black
escaped
convict
who
has
been
sentenced
for
three
years
apparent
to
automobile’s
theft.
he
is
out
of
captivity
for
a
period
of
three
days
and
while
out
of
captivity
he
allegedly
committed
several
crimes
as
well
as
the
rape
for
which
he
was
convicted.
the
state
evidence
was
that
he
broke
into
the
home
of
a
white
housewife,
the
wife
of
a
physician,
threatened
her
with
a
pair
of
scissors,
doles
$5.00
and
some
change,
engaged
in
a
physical
struggle
with
her,
raped
her,
escaped
when
the
maid
arrived
and
hid
in
the
neighbors
garage
for
several
hours
till
he
was
found.
the
prosecutrix
in
addition
to
having
been
raped,
suffered
from
abrasions
and
lacerations
but
no
additional
injuries
appeared.
the
petitioner
was
indigent
and
represented
by
court-appointed
counsel,
apart
from
pretrial
motions
asking
for
appointment
of
a
psychiatrist,
a
change
of
venue
and
a
continuance
to
allow
time
to
prepare
the
case.
the
defense
presented
no
evidence.
the
trial
including
a
separate
proceeding
held
in
the
morning
the
determined
the
petitioner
is
competent
to
stand
trial,
last
but
one
day.
procuring
only
the
base
evidence
and
the
petitioner
is
a
negro
and
on
this
record
they
sentenced
him
to
death.
the
jury
acted
under
georgia
law,
section
26-1302
which
appears
in
page
1a
of
our
brief
which
is
that
--
was
at
that
time,
it
has
been
changed
slightly.
the
crime
of
rape
shall
be
punished
by
death
unless
the
jury
recommends
mercy
in
which
event
punishment
shall
be
imprisonment
for
life.
provided
however
the
jury
in
all
cases
may
fix
the
punishment
by
imprisonment
and
labor
in
the
penitentiary
for
not
less
than
one
year
or
more
than
twenty
years.
in
the
two
cases
just
argued
akins
and
furman,
the
petitioners
urged
that
the
death
penalty
in
cases
of
homicide
constitutes
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
hereto
in
this
case,
we
urge
that
the
death
penalty
in
the
case
of
rape
constitutes
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
and
for
a
moment,
i
would
like
to
focus
on
the
word
unusual.
infliction
of
capital
punishment
for
rape
is
indeed
the
most
unusual
of
punishments
for
any
crime
in
the
united
states
or
indeed
in
the
world.
at
this
point,
i
am
going
to
speak
for
a
moment
too
about
racial
statistics,
there
have
been
some
questions
about
racial
statistics
and
statistics
that
may
or
may
not
be
judicially
noticeable.
all
the
statistics
that
i
will
relate
come
from
national
prisoner
statistics,
their
publication
of
the
united
states
department
of
justice.
the
figures
are
so
overwhelming
that
at
a
minimum
if
they
are
not
conclusive,
they
have
kept
the
burden
upon
the
respondents
who
explained
them.
this
is
not
strange
in
a
racial
case,
in
cases
involving
juries,
schools,
employment,
voting,
figures
speak
at
the
fifth
circuits,
have
another
context
and
judges
listen
and
sometimes
the
figures
are
not
persuasive,
sometimes
they
are
conclusive.
at
a
minimum
if
they
are
sufficiently
persuasive
they
have
kept
the
burden
of
explanation
upon
the
other
side.
our
opponent
just
said
in
their
brief
and
have
said
in
argument
with
regard
to
other
aspects
of
statistics
in
these
cases
that
there
many
questions
of
the
statistics
leave
unanswered,
for
example
in
a
rape
case,
has
a
death
penalty
been
inflicted
because
the
defendant
is
a
particularly
viscous
person.
was
the
crime
committed
by
a
group
of
people?
was
a
weapon
used?
was
an
injury
inflicted?
does
the
victim
have
a
particular
reputation
for
chastity?
was
there
a
child
involved
and
so
forth?
we
have
attempted
to
answer
these
questions
in
another
litigation
in
the
state
of
georgia.
williams
against
georgia
in
which
petitions
for
writ
of
certiorari
is
now
pending
before
this
court,
the
law
of
the
state
of
georgia
as
declared
by
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
in
the
williams
case
is,
that
the
explanations
are
inadmissible,
williams
against
georgia
might
say
is
purported
to
173
southeast
second,
72.
the
explanations
of
the
statistics
which
we
have
attempted
to
put
into
evidence
by
testimony
and
analysis
of
a
representative
sample
of
the
rape
cases
in
state
of
georgia
over
a
20
year
period,
is
that
it
is
inadmissible
and
we
would
say
that
the
figures
that
i
am
about
to
discuss
are
probably
undoubtedly
conclusive
on
their
face
but
if
there
are
any
explanations
to
be
made
they
should
come
from
the
state
of
georgia,
not
from
the
respondents
who
have
made
an
effort
as
to
these
figures.
the
crime
of
rape
is
punished
capitally
in
the
southern
state
only,
is
or
was
an
exception
in
the
state
of
nevada
which
was
punished
by
death
where
bodily
harm
was
done,
that
statute
has
been
invalidated
and
so
it
is
southern
phenomenon
only.
mr.
jack
greenberg
by
the
court.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
believe
it
was
invalidated
on
the
campaign
against
the
u.s.
executive
branch.
it
is
visited
upon
black
people
in
the
south
overwhelmingly,
there
have
been
455
executions
for
rape.
since
statistics
have
been
kept
and
of
the
445
men
put
to
death,
405
had
been
black.
at
the
moment,
there
are
73
men
on
death
row
awaiting
execution
for
the
crime
of
rape.
of
the
73,
62
are
black,
one
is
the
mexican,
one
is
an
indian
and
the
race
of
three
is
not
known
to
us.
that
means
that
historically
since
figures
were
kept
and
at
the
present
time
the
execution
rate
for
the
crime
of
rape
run
approximately
at
the
rate
of
90%
black
defendants
put
to
death
were
being
held
on
death
row
to
be
put
to
death.
in
the
state
of
georgia,
61
men
had
been
put
to
death
for
the
crime
of
rape
since
statistics
were
kept.
of
those
61,
58
have
been
black
and
the
georgia
statistics
run
somewhat
higher
at
about
a
rate
of
95%.
now,
in
the
case
of
williams
against
the
state
of
georgia
and
in
two
other
cases
pending
in
the
state
of
georgia,
there
have
been
efforts
to
examine
these
statistics
in
considerably
more
detail.
all
this
matters
are
pending
in
court
in
the
state
of
georgia
and
williams
case
is
pending
here
as
a
matter
of
fact.
in
the
case
of
mitchell
against
smith
published
pending
in
the
court
of
caswell
county.
the
statistics
were
developed
at
a
very
considerable
length
and
it
was
demonstrated
that
in
cases
where
a
black
man
raped
a
white
woman,
38%
of
the
defendants
were
sentenced
to
death.
in
a
case
where
any
other
racial
combination
was
involved,
one
half
of
1%
of
the
defendants
were
sentenced
to
death.
now,
these
are
the
states
where
it
is
well-known,
i
need
not
elaborate
on
this
where
there
has
been
for
many
years
until
outlawed
by
this
court,
in
other
courts
racial
segregation
in
schools
and
various
aspects
of
public
life
are
required
or
permitted,
these
were
also
the
states
and
i
think
it
is
much
more
appropriate
to
the
point
which
had
anti-miscegenation
laws
until
they
were
outlawed
by
the
loving
case,
and
there
is
a
long
footnote
in
loving
case
which
detailed
which
of
the
states
had
those
laws.
also
with
considerable
overlap
of
state
which
have
capital
punishment
for
rape.
now,
in
the
rest
of
the
world
and
i
think
that
an
inadmissible
consideration
is
taken
to
account.
capital
punishment
for
rape
is
authorized
only
in
south
africa,
malawi
and
taiwan.
that
is
throughout
the
entire
world,
certainly
across
the
entire
western
world
which
shares
our
culture,
that
the
entire
english
speaking
world
which
hears
our
jurisprudence,
throughout
the
entire
united
states,
throughout
the
southern
part
of
the
united
states
with
the
exception
of
black
men,
there
is
slight
exception
for
some
small
ants
and
the
white
ants
who
suffered
death
penalty.
capital
punishment
for
rape
is
a
penalty
so
rare
that
i
think
the
word
“unusual”
is
perhaps
an
understatement
of
the
frequency
which
it
appears
difficult
to
think
of
a
punishment
which
is
more
unusual
than
capital
punishment
for
rape.
it
is
unusual
in
--
look
at
in
other
points
of
view,
in
ralph
against
warden,
the
case
that
tried
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
which
invalidated
capital
punishment
for
rape
in
certain
circumstances.
judge
butzner
sets
forth
the
fact
that
between
1960
and
1968
there
were
190,790
reported
cases
of
rape,
by
1971
and
1972,
of
course
the
figures
are
higher.
yet
at
that
time,
there
were
only
70
men
on
death
row
for
the
crime.
and
the
disproportion
is
to
say
stagnant
as
though
the
punishment
is
cruel
and
unusual
in
any
sense
of
those
words.
now,
the
state
of
georgia
particularly,
the
outcome
which
i
have
described
here,
i
may
not
be
strange,
in
fact
maybe
in
entirely
it
is
speculated.
there
is
a
legislative
history
to
the
georgia
statute
which
casts
considerable
life
on
its
reasons
for
its
enactment
and
the
way
it
is
operated.
before
the
civil
war
in
the
state
of
georgia
there
were
two
sets
of
statutory
penalties
for
the
crime
of
rape.
if
a
slave
or
a
free
person
of
color
raped
a
white
woman,
he
was
to
get
the
death
penalty.
any
other
rape
was
punishable
by
a
term
of
one
to
20
years.
after
the
civil
war,
the
statutory
scheme
which
was
on
the
books
in
the
state
of
georgia
was
repealed
and
the
offense
would
essentially
statutory
scheme
that
we
have
at
this
point
was
reenacted
to
take
its
place
and
we
have
all
these
statutes
set
forth
verbatim
in
the
appendix
at
the
end
of
our
brief.
and
the
discretionary
death
penalty
for
the
crime
of
rape
was
enacted
into
georgia
law
and
what
has
happened
in
the
administration
of
the
statute,
this
discretionary
statute
has
been
essentially
what
was
required
under
the
particular
language
of
the
georgia
legislation
that
existed
prior
to
the
civil
war.
looking
at
capital
punishment
in
general,
as
for
as
the
crime
of
rape
and
the
crime
of
homicide,
we
find
that
while
it
is
authorized
for
a
one
purpose
or
another
in
most
of
the
states,
it
is
in
fact
almost
never
applied
except
in
random,
unstandardized
way
against
the
poorest,
the
least
educated
and
disproportionately
against
racial
minority.
the
figures
can
be
put
together
in
various
ways,
it
might
be
said
that,
it
has
been
said
by
some
counsel
this
morning
that
most
of
the
states
authorized
capital
punishment
for
one
crime
or
another.
another
way
of
looking
at
it
is
that
if
one
takes
the
past
decade,
1962
and
takes
the
state
where
there
have
been
no
executions
and
going
to
the
past
decade,
one
does
not
--
one
is
not
confined
to
the
period
of
time,
i
mean,
judicial
stage
have
been
dominating
the
scripture.
if
one
takes
the
past
decade,
one
finds
that
in
24
states
in
which
there
has
not
been
an
execution
or
executions
might
be
permitted.
one
finds
nine
states
in
which
capital
punishment
has
been
completely
abolished
making
33
states
or
60%
of
the
--
66%
of
the
state
of
the
states
of
union
which
means
they
have
exercised
or
permit
capital
punishment
for
any
crime
and
overwhelming
number
of
jurisdictions
in
the
free
world
including
invalid
in
england,
the
judicial
chair
upon
the
jurisprudence.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
think
we
have
a
table
here,
how
many
men
under
sentence
of
death
or
--?
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
right,
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
in
how
many
states
are
there
people
under
sentence
of
death?
i
think
we
have
statistics
on
that
here.
i
just
do
not
have
the
statement
in
front
of
me.
there
is
just
so
many
statistics
in
all
these
states.
mr.
jack
greenberg
someone
they
have
not
(voice
overlap)
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
well
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
it
hadn't
spoken
of
the
question
of
unusualness
--
just
awarded
to
about
the
issue
of
cruelty,
we
will
submit
that
if
the
word
means
anything
at
all
in
plain
english
and
analysis
of
a
constitution
of
legislative
provision
while
it
does
not
end
with
the
men
with
--
but
must
start
with
the
reading
of
the
plain
language.
the
intentional
taking
of
a
life
of
a
prisoner
who
is
held
in
captivity
and
has
been
held
there
for
years,
years
by
any
plain
understanding
of
that
word
“cruel”
and
i
think
that
the
framers
of
the
bill
of
rights
recognized
that,
they
may
not
have
thought
it
was
unusual
but
mr.
livermore
in
the
debate
on
the
bill
of
rights,
in
our
brief,
it
is
set
forth
on
7
(d),
some
of
this
very
little
legislative
history,
spoke
about
the
cruel
and
unusual
clause
then
it
is
said
that
no
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
is
to
be
inflicted.
it
is
sometimes
necessary
to
hang
a
man,
villains
often
deserve
whipping
and
perhaps
having
their
ears
cut
off
but
are
we
in
the
future
to
be
preventive
from
inflicting
the
punishments
because
they
are
cruel,
i
mean
if
they
were
recognized
to
be
cruel,
whipping
and
cutting
off
the
ears,
would
not
recognize
to
be
unusual.
now,
it
is
unusual
for
any
cause
and
even
more
unusual
for
the
crime
of
rape.
as
to
--
sometimes,
the
meaning
of
the
term
is
confined
to
mode
of
punishments
that
is
gassing
or
electrocution
or
hanging
cruel?
after
that,
there
are
materials
set
forth
in
our
brief
but
if
the
case
is
reduced
to
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
particular
mode
of
execution
is
cruel,
the
minimum
ought
to
be
made
an
evidentiary
hearing
which
had
been
at
point
some
of
these
cases
have
discussed
that
somewhat
at
length
in
the
last
footnote,
in
328.
in
some
cases
and
indeed
historically
we
have
looked
at
the
question
of
proportionality
or
disproportionality,
is
it
excessive
to
take
a
man’s
life
for
any
crime
or
for
the
crime
of
rape.
and
that
raises
the
questions
submitted
the
common
view
of
the
death
penalty
of
rape
that
throughout
this
country
or
through
out
the
world.
that
is
the
fitness
or
the
unfitness
of
the
punishment.
and
in
this
sense
through
the
and
unusualness
we
believe
merge
and
we
get
back
to
the
question
particularly
in
the
rape
cases
of
--
is
it
disproportionate
to
take
a
life
for
this
crime
when
--
so
few
countries
in
the
world,
no
other
countries
in
the
world
and
so
few
states
with
this
punishment
for
this
crime
and
then
confine
it
essential
to
the
black
people
and
the
note
here
saying
that
on
death
rows
there
are
now
thirty
men
on
death
row
in
34
states.
there
is
one
man
in
arkansas
and
105
in
california.
mr.
jack
greenberg
34
states.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
would
think
that
must
be
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
think
there
it's
24,
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
i
believe
so,
yes.
and
these
cases
while
they
involve
this
with
capital
punishment,
also
involve
role
of
the
bill
of
rights
in
our
constitutional
scheme.
there
are
faithful
cases
for
racial
minorities
and
not
only
for
the
reason
for
--
disproportion
in
which
capital
punishment
is
inflicted
upon
black
men
and
mexican-americans
or
particular
unit
just
confined
to
this
case
applied
with
rape.
more
than
the
life
of
a
miserable
hand
from
individuals
who
are
involved.
no
matter
how
these
cases
come
out,
if
they
are
lost,
there
will
be
only
a
few
unfortunates
put
to
death
out
of
our
national
population
of
more
than
200
million
souls.
the
question
is
what
end.
taking
a
life
in
the
name
of
the
law
has
no
practical
effect
than
the
regular
administration
of
justice.
it
is
symbolic
act
perhaps
the
kind
of
a
ritual
sacrifice
which
held
many
things
but
to
racial
minority,
the
black
people
have
held
something
that
how
much
the
law
values
their
own
individual
lives.
it
would
not
be
strange
if
the
oppressiveness,
the
unevenness,
the
cruelty,
the
unusualness
with
which
the
supreme
penalty
is
inflicted
works
in
effect
on
how
are
those
minorities
use
the
legal
system.
the
bill
of
rights
of
which
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishments
clause
to
the
part
has
long
assured
that
our
legal
system
is
just
poor
and
beneficial
to
all
our
citizens.
the
purpose
of
the
bill
of
rights,
one
of
which
is
welding
this
nation
into
a
people
of
equal
respect
for
the
reasons
for
the
rule
of
law
can
be
served
only
we
submit
by
outlawing
the
barbarity
of
gassing,
hanging
and
electrocution
in
the
name
of
the
law.
it
is
suggested
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
counsel
for
respondent
has
conceded
that
of
the
61
persons
put
to
death
for
the
crime
of
rape,
all
61
had
been
black
then
there
would
be
what
you
call
a
prima
facie
case
that
there
was
some
sort
of
specific
racial
incidents
to
the
penalty.
well,
the
facts
are
it
is
58
out
of
61
and
i
submit
that
is
different
but
it
is
just
de
minimus.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
i
was
about
to
come
to
that
that
would
make
a
prima
facie
case
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
that
is
correct.
now
we
are
–
mr.
jack
greenberg
we
are
here
under
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
clause
of
the
constitution,
not
the
equal
protection
clause
in
which
all
the
questions
that
might
arise
on
equal
protection
case
as
to
explanation
we
would
submit
do
not
arise
when
the
only
issue
is,
is
it
unusual,
not
why
is
it
unusual,
how
is
it
unusual,
what
are
the
possible
explanations
and
so
forth.
here,
it
is
not
unusual.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well
i
won't
say
that
is
exclusively
the
meaning,
the
terms
have
been
used
in
a
variety
of
ways
but
one
meaning
certainly
is
frequency
or
rarity
on
this
case.
i
would
say
yes
that
if
a
death
penalty
for
rape
is
something
that
is,
you
know,
almost
never
used,
then
it
is
extremely
unusual
and
we
would
submit
would
be
under
doubt
that
it
is
cruel.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
but
nowadays
almost
not
at
all,
either
--
i
mean,
it
is
confined
to
a
part
of
the
country,
to
a
part
of
the
population
of
that
part
of
the
country
in
a
world
in
which
it
is
totally
non-existent
with
very
rare
of
a
sentence
that
is
the
meaning
of
unusual.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
i
have
some
figures.
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
only
georgia
figures
we
have
been
able
to
find
are
in,
i
might
say,
are
set
forth
in
our
brief
in
the
akins
case
on
page
9f,
they
are
not
comprehensive.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
is
right.
mr.
jack
greenberg
right.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
we
have
figured
only,
we
have
been
able
to
find
figures
only
from
july
1964
to
december
31,1968.
during
that
period
of
time
there
were
299
commitments
for
the
crime
of
rape,
now
that
does
not
include
for
example
probation,
sentences
and
the
variety
of
other
things
but
299
commitments
of
which
8
men
was
sentenced
to
death
but
the
large
of
those
eight
men
obviously
now
only
obviously
were
not
taken.
it
should
be
–
none
of
them
actually
were
taking
the
figure
with
circumstances
stage
of
that
period
of
time.
that
and
the
citations
to
all
available,
that
are
on
page
9f
of
the
brief
in
paragraph
3.
now,
as
to
all
the
possible
explanations,
why
it
turns
out
to
be
58
out
of
61,
respondent
says
that
the
circumstances
of
the
crime
are
to
be
considered.
the
georgia
courts
will
not
contemplate
that
evidence,
they
will
not
consider
that
evidence.
there
has
been
an
effort
to
introduce
that
kind
of
evidence
into
the
courts
of
the
state
of
georgia.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
we
conducted
a
very
extensive
study
of
capital
punishment
of
it
as
20
years
in
most
of
the
southern
states
including
the
state
of
georgia
and
every
possible
factor
that
could
occur
to
human
imagination
that
might
affect
a
juror
in
coming
to
over
crucial
penalty
was
putting
to
the
study
of
every
single
record
in
all
of
these
states.
they
were
all
examined.
the
viciousness
of
the
crime
whether
a
group
of
–
mr.
jack
greenberg
or
something.
this
was
subject
to
the
statistical
analysis
and
an
effort
was
made
to
introduce
it
in
number
of
georgia
cases
including
williams
which
is
now
pending
here
and
one
of
the
issues
in
the
williams
case
now
pending
here
is
the
fact
that
georgia
courts
would
permit
a
specific
evidence.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
it
would
not
–
but
the
evidence
we
are
talking
about
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
the
penalty
is
unconstitutional
because
it
violates
the
cruel
and
unusual
clause,
it
is
very
extensive
and
i
think
if
with
the
persuasive
evidence
which
if
i
might
say
pending
in
courts
in
the
state
of
georgia
would
show
that
38%
of
black
man
convicted
of
raping
white
woman
are
sentence
to
death.
one
half
of
1%
of
all
other
racial
combination.
mr.
jack
greenberg
on
the
matter
of
evidence
that
goes
to
the
penalty,
in
georgia’s
single
verdict
procedure,
that
sort
of
evidence
as
we
understand
the
georgia
law
is
not
admissible.
what
maybe
considered
out
a
motion
for
new
trial
is
the
evidence
in
the
case
generally
alleged.
mr.
jack
greenberg
circumstances
of
that
particular
case
but
other
evidence
might
possibly
go
defensively
such
as
let
us
say
the
mental
stage
of
the
defendant
in
the
case.
that
is
not
admissible
under
georgia
law
of
this
case.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
there
was
no
evidence
put
on
in
this
case.
there
was
an
effort
to
get
a
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
would
say,
yes
we
were
in
this
sense.
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
justice
marshall
what
occurred
in
this
case,
there
was
an
application
to
the
court
to
reform
to
the
psychiatrist
to
examine
this
defendant
and
testify
after
the
question
of
his
sanity.
the
appointment
of
psychiatrist
was
denied.
the
court
appointed
a
psychiatrist
solely
under
question
of
this
competence
for
the
trial.
mr.
jack
greenberg
we
did
not
tended
these
figures
in
this
case.
the
georgia
courts
upheld
it
there
and
it
is
admissible
in
georgia
in
other
two
or
cases
that
are
now
pending.
mr.
jack
greenberg
we
have
no
ruling
in
this
case.
there
is
no
doubt
however
that
this
very
exhaustive,
time
consuming
and
expensive
examination
of
georgia
practice.
if
our
contentions
were
upheld
in
any
case,
it
would
be
applicable
to
all
similar
case.
but
there
was
nothing
pending
in
the
states.
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
hereon
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
and
it
raises
in
another
context
the
questions
of
the
preceding
case
and
that
is
whether
the
imposition
in
carrying
out
of
the
death
penalty
in
the
case
that
one
convicted
of
the
crime
of
rape
constitutes
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
in
violation
of
the
eight
and
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution.
a
petitioner,
lucious
jackson
was
sentenced
to
death
for
the
crime
of
rape
by
the
superior
court
of
chatham
county
georgia
in
1968.
his
conviction
was
upheld
by
the
state
supreme
court
against
eight
and
fourteenth
amendment
policies.
petitioner
was
21
year
old,
black
escaped
convict
who
has
been
sentenced
for
three
years
apparent
to
automobile’s
theft.
he
is
out
of
captivity
for
a
period
of
three
days
and
while
out
of
captivity
he
allegedly
committed
several
crimes
as
well
as
the
rape
for
which
he
was
convicted.
the
state
evidence
was
that
he
broke
into
the
home
of
a
white
housewife,
the
wife
of
a
physician,
threatened
her
with
a
pair
of
scissors,
doles
$5.00
and
some
change,
engaged
in
a
physical
struggle
with
her,
raped
her,
escaped
when
the
maid
arrived
and
hid
in
the
neighbors
garage
for
several
hours
till
he
was
found.
the
prosecutrix
in
addition
to
having
been
raped,
suffered
from
abrasions
and
lacerations
but
no
additional
injuries
appeared.
the
petitioner
was
indigent
and
represented
by
court-appointed
counsel,
apart
from
pretrial
motions
asking
for
appointment
of
a
psychiatrist,
a
change
of
venue
and
a
continuance
to
allow
time
to
prepare
the
case.
the
defense
presented
no
evidence.
the
trial
including
a
separate
proceeding
held
in
the
morning
the
determined
the
petitioner
is
competent
to
stand
trial,
last
but
one
day.
procuring
only
the
base
evidence
and
the
petitioner
is
a
negro
and
on
this
record
they
sentenced
him
to
death.
the
jury
acted
under
georgia
law,
section
26-1302
which
appears
in
page
1a
of
our
brief
which
is
that
--
was
at
that
time,
it
has
been
changed
slightly.
the
crime
of
rape
shall
be
punished
by
death
unless
the
jury
recommends
mercy
in
which
event
punishment
shall
be
imprisonment
for
life.
provided
however
the
jury
in
all
cases
may
fix
the
punishment
by
imprisonment
and
labor
in
the
penitentiary
for
not
less
than
one
year
or
more
than
twenty
years.
in
the
two
cases
just
argued
akins
and
furman,
the
petitioners
urged
that
the
death
penalty
in
cases
of
homicide
constitutes
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
hereto
in
this
case,
we
urge
that
the
death
penalty
in
the
case
of
rape
constitutes
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
and
for
a
moment,
i
would
like
to
focus
on
the
word
unusual.
infliction
of
capital
punishment
for
rape
is
indeed
the
most
unusual
of
punishments
for
any
crime
in
the
united
states
or
indeed
in
the
world.
at
this
point,
i
am
going
to
speak
for
a
moment
too
about
racial
statistics,
there
have
been
some
questions
about
racial
statistics
and
statistics
that
may
or
may
not
be
judicially
noticeable.
all
the
statistics
that
i
will
relate
come
from
national
prisoner
statistics,
their
publication
of
the
united
states
department
of
justice.
the
figures
are
so
overwhelming
that
at
a
minimum
if
they
are
not
conclusive,
they
have
kept
the
burden
upon
the
respondents
who
explained
them.
this
is
not
strange
in
a
racial
case,
in
cases
involving
juries,
schools,
employment,
voting,
figures
speak
at
the
fifth
circuits,
have
another
context
and
judges
listen
and
sometimes
the
figures
are
not
persuasive,
sometimes
they
are
conclusive.
at
a
minimum
if
they
are
sufficiently
persuasive
they
have
kept
the
burden
of
explanation
upon
the
other
side.
our
opponent
just
said
in
their
brief
and
have
said
in
argument
with
regard
to
other
aspects
of
statistics
in
these
cases
that
there
many
questions
of
the
statistics
leave
unanswered,
for
example
in
a
rape
case,
has
a
death
penalty
been
inflicted
because
the
defendant
is
a
particularly
viscous
person.
was
the
crime
committed
by
a
group
of
people?
was
a
weapon
used?
was
an
injury
inflicted?
does
the
victim
have
a
particular
reputation
for
chastity?
was
there
a
child
involved
and
so
forth?
we
have
attempted
to
answer
these
questions
in
another
litigation
in
the
state
of
georgia.
williams
against
georgia
in
which
petitions
for
writ
of
certiorari
is
now
pending
before
this
court,
the
law
of
the
state
of
georgia
as
declared
by
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
in
the
williams
case
is,
that
the
explanations
are
inadmissible,
williams
against
georgia
might
say
is
purported
to
173
southeast
second,
72.
the
explanations
of
the
statistics
which
we
have
attempted
to
put
into
evidence
by
testimony
and
analysis
of
a
representative
sample
of
the
rape
cases
in
state
of
georgia
over
a
20
year
period,
is
that
it
is
inadmissible
and
we
would
say
that
the
figures
that
i
am
about
to
discuss
are
probably
undoubtedly
conclusive
on
their
face
but
if
there
are
any
explanations
to
be
made
they
should
come
from
the
state
of
georgia,
not
from
the
respondents
who
have
made
an
effort
as
to
these
figures.
the
crime
of
rape
is
punished
capitally
in
the
southern
state
only,
is
or
was
an
exception
in
the
state
of
nevada
which
was
punished
by
death
where
bodily
harm
was
done,
that
statute
has
been
invalidated
and
so
it
is
southern
phenomenon
only.
mr.
jack
greenberg
by
the
court.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
believe
it
was
invalidated
on
the
campaign
against
the
u.s.
executive
branch.
it
is
visited
upon
black
people
in
the
south
overwhelmingly,
there
have
been
455
executions
for
rape.
since
statistics
have
been
kept
and
of
the
445
men
put
to
death,
405
had
been
black.
at
the
moment,
there
are
73
men
on
death
row
awaiting
execution
for
the
crime
of
rape.
of
the
73,
62
are
black,
one
is
the
mexican,
one
is
an
indian
and
the
race
of
three
is
not
known
to
us.
that
means
that
historically
since
figures
were
kept
and
at
the
present
time
the
execution
rate
for
the
crime
of
rape
run
approximately
at
the
rate
of
90%
black
defendants
put
to
death
were
being
held
on
death
row
to
be
put
to
death.
in
the
state
of
georgia,
61
men
had
been
put
to
death
for
the
crime
of
rape
since
statistics
were
kept.
of
those
61,
58
have
been
black
and
the
georgia
statistics
run
somewhat
higher
at
about
a
rate
of
95%.
now,
in
the
case
of
williams
against
the
state
of
georgia
and
in
two
other
cases
pending
in
the
state
of
georgia,
there
have
been
efforts
to
examine
these
statistics
in
considerably
more
detail.
all
this
matters
are
pending
in
court
in
the
state
of
georgia
and
williams
case
is
pending
here
as
a
matter
of
fact.
in
the
case
of
mitchell
against
smith
published
pending
in
the
court
of
caswell
county.
the
statistics
were
developed
at
a
very
considerable
length
and
it
was
demonstrated
that
in
cases
where
a
black
man
raped
a
white
woman,
38%
of
the
defendants
were
sentenced
to
death.
in
a
case
where
any
other
racial
combination
was
involved,
one
half
of
1%
of
the
defendants
were
sentenced
to
death.
now,
these
are
the
states
where
it
is
well-known,
i
need
not
elaborate
on
this
where
there
has
been
for
many
years
until
outlawed
by
this
court,
in
other
courts
racial
segregation
in
schools
and
various
aspects
of
public
life
are
required
or
permitted,
these
were
also
the
states
and
i
think
it
is
much
more
appropriate
to
the
point
which
had
anti-miscegenation
laws
until
they
were
outlawed
by
the
loving
case,
and
there
is
a
long
footnote
in
loving
case
which
detailed
which
of
the
states
had
those
laws.
also
with
considerable
overlap
of
state
which
have
capital
punishment
for
rape.
now,
in
the
rest
of
the
world
and
i
think
that
an
inadmissible
consideration
is
taken
to
account.
capital
punishment
for
rape
is
authorized
only
in
south
africa,
malawi
and
taiwan.
that
is
throughout
the
entire
world,
certainly
across
the
entire
western
world
which
shares
our
culture,
that
the
entire
english
speaking
world
which
hears
our
jurisprudence,
throughout
the
entire
united
states,
throughout
the
southern
part
of
the
united
states
with
the
exception
of
black
men,
there
is
slight
exception
for
some
small
ants
and
the
white
ants
who
suffered
death
penalty.
capital
punishment
for
rape
is
a
penalty
so
rare
that
i
think
the
word
“unusual”
is
perhaps
an
understatement
of
the
frequency
which
it
appears
difficult
to
think
of
a
punishment
which
is
more
unusual
than
capital
punishment
for
rape.
it
is
unusual
in
--
look
at
in
other
points
of
view,
in
ralph
against
warden,
the
case
that
tried
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
which
invalidated
capital
punishment
for
rape
in
certain
circumstances.
judge
butzner
sets
forth
the
fact
that
between
1960
and
1968
there
were
190,790
reported
cases
of
rape,
by
1971
and
1972,
of
course
the
figures
are
higher.
yet
at
that
time,
there
were
only
70
men
on
death
row
for
the
crime.
and
the
disproportion
is
to
say
stagnant
as
though
the
punishment
is
cruel
and
unusual
in
any
sense
of
those
words.
now,
the
state
of
georgia
particularly,
the
outcome
which
i
have
described
here,
i
may
not
be
strange,
in
fact
maybe
in
entirely
it
is
speculated.
there
is
a
legislative
history
to
the
georgia
statute
which
casts
considerable
life
on
its
reasons
for
its
enactment
and
the
way
it
is
operated.
before
the
civil
war
in
the
state
of
georgia
there
were
two
sets
of
statutory
penalties
for
the
crime
of
rape.
if
a
slave
or
a
free
person
of
color
raped
a
white
woman,
he
was
to
get
the
death
penalty.
any
other
rape
was
punishable
by
a
term
of
one
to
20
years.
after
the
civil
war,
the
statutory
scheme
which
was
on
the
books
in
the
state
of
georgia
was
repealed
and
the
offense
would
essentially
statutory
scheme
that
we
have
at
this
point
was
reenacted
to
take
its
place
and
we
have
all
these
statutes
set
forth
verbatim
in
the
appendix
at
the
end
of
our
brief.
and
the
discretionary
death
penalty
for
the
crime
of
rape
was
enacted
into
georgia
law
and
what
has
happened
in
the
administration
of
the
statute,
this
discretionary
statute
has
been
essentially
what
was
required
under
the
particular
language
of
the
georgia
legislation
that
existed
prior
to
the
civil
war.
looking
at
capital
punishment
in
general,
as
for
as
the
crime
of
rape
and
the
crime
of
homicide,
we
find
that
while
it
is
authorized
for
a
one
purpose
or
another
in
most
of
the
states,
it
is
in
fact
almost
never
applied
except
in
random,
unstandardized
way
against
the
poorest,
the
least
educated
and
disproportionately
against
racial
minority.
the
figures
can
be
put
together
in
various
ways,
it
might
be
said
that,
it
has
been
said
by
some
counsel
this
morning
that
most
of
the
states
authorized
capital
punishment
for
one
crime
or
another.
another
way
of
looking
at
it
is
that
if
one
takes
the
past
decade,
1962
and
takes
the
state
where
there
have
been
no
executions
and
going
to
the
past
decade,
one
does
not
--
one
is
not
confined
to
the
period
of
time,
i
mean,
judicial
stage
have
been
dominating
the
scripture.
if
one
takes
the
past
decade,
one
finds
that
in
24
states
in
which
there
has
not
been
an
execution
or
executions
might
be
permitted.
one
finds
nine
states
in
which
capital
punishment
has
been
completely
abolished
making
33
states
or
60%
of
the
--
66%
of
the
state
of
the
states
of
union
which
means
they
have
exercised
or
permit
capital
punishment
for
any
crime
and
overwhelming
number
of
jurisdictions
in
the
free
world
including
invalid
in
england,
the
judicial
chair
upon
the
jurisprudence.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
think
we
have
a
table
here,
how
many
men
under
sentence
of
death
or
--?
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
right,
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
in
how
many
states
are
there
people
under
sentence
of
death?
i
think
we
have
statistics
on
that
here.
i
just
do
not
have
the
statement
in
front
of
me.
there
is
just
so
many
statistics
in
all
these
states.
mr.
jack
greenberg
someone
they
have
not
(voice
overlap)
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
well
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
it
hadn't
spoken
of
the
question
of
unusualness
--
just
awarded
to
about
the
issue
of
cruelty,
we
will
submit
that
if
the
word
means
anything
at
all
in
plain
english
and
analysis
of
a
constitution
of
legislative
provision
while
it
does
not
end
with
the
men
with
--
but
must
start
with
the
reading
of
the
plain
language.
the
intentional
taking
of
a
life
of
a
prisoner
who
is
held
in
captivity
and
has
been
held
there
for
years,
years
by
any
plain
understanding
of
that
word
“cruel”
and
i
think
that
the
framers
of
the
bill
of
rights
recognized
that,
they
may
not
have
thought
it
was
unusual
but
mr.
livermore
in
the
debate
on
the
bill
of
rights,
in
our
brief,
it
is
set
forth
on
7
(d),
some
of
this
very
little
legislative
history,
spoke
about
the
cruel
and
unusual
clause
then
it
is
said
that
no
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
is
to
be
inflicted.
it
is
sometimes
necessary
to
hang
a
man,
villains
often
deserve
whipping
and
perhaps
having
their
ears
cut
off
but
are
we
in
the
future
to
be
preventive
from
inflicting
the
punishments
because
they
are
cruel,
i
mean
if
they
were
recognized
to
be
cruel,
whipping
and
cutting
off
the
ears,
would
not
recognize
to
be
unusual.
now,
it
is
unusual
for
any
cause
and
even
more
unusual
for
the
crime
of
rape.
as
to
--
sometimes,
the
meaning
of
the
term
is
confined
to
mode
of
punishments
that
is
gassing
or
electrocution
or
hanging
cruel?
after
that,
there
are
materials
set
forth
in
our
brief
but
if
the
case
is
reduced
to
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
particular
mode
of
execution
is
cruel,
the
minimum
ought
to
be
made
an
evidentiary
hearing
which
had
been
at
point
some
of
these
cases
have
discussed
that
somewhat
at
length
in
the
last
footnote,
in
328.
in
some
cases
and
indeed
historically
we
have
looked
at
the
question
of
proportionality
or
disproportionality,
is
it
excessive
to
take
a
man’s
life
for
any
crime
or
for
the
crime
of
rape.
and
that
raises
the
questions
submitted
the
common
view
of
the
death
penalty
of
rape
that
throughout
this
country
or
through
out
the
world.
that
is
the
fitness
or
the
unfitness
of
the
punishment.
and
in
this
sense
through
the
and
unusualness
we
believe
merge
and
we
get
back
to
the
question
particularly
in
the
rape
cases
of
--
is
it
disproportionate
to
take
a
life
for
this
crime
when
--
so
few
countries
in
the
world,
no
other
countries
in
the
world
and
so
few
states
with
this
punishment
for
this
crime
and
then
confine
it
essential
to
the
black
people
and
the
note
here
saying
that
on
death
rows
there
are
now
thirty
men
on
death
row
in
34
states.
there
is
one
man
in
arkansas
and
105
in
california.
mr.
jack
greenberg
34
states.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
would
think
that
must
be
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
think
there
it's
24,
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
i
believe
so,
yes.
and
these
cases
while
they
involve
this
with
capital
punishment,
also
involve
role
of
the
bill
of
rights
in
our
constitutional
scheme.
there
are
faithful
cases
for
racial
minorities
and
not
only
for
the
reason
for
--
disproportion
in
which
capital
punishment
is
inflicted
upon
black
men
and
mexican-americans
or
particular
unit
just
confined
to
this
case
applied
with
rape.
more
than
the
life
of
a
miserable
hand
from
individuals
who
are
involved.
no
matter
how
these
cases
come
out,
if
they
are
lost,
there
will
be
only
a
few
unfortunates
put
to
death
out
of
our
national
population
of
more
than
200
million
souls.
the
question
is
what
end.
taking
a
life
in
the
name
of
the
law
has
no
practical
effect
than
the
regular
administration
of
justice.
it
is
symbolic
act
perhaps
the
kind
of
a
ritual
sacrifice
which
held
many
things
but
to
racial
minority,
the
black
people
have
held
something
that
how
much
the
law
values
their
own
individual
lives.
it
would
not
be
strange
if
the
oppressiveness,
the
unevenness,
the
cruelty,
the
unusualness
with
which
the
supreme
penalty
is
inflicted
works
in
effect
on
how
are
those
minorities
use
the
legal
system.
the
bill
of
rights
of
which
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishments
clause
to
the
part
has
long
assured
that
our
legal
system
is
just
poor
and
beneficial
to
all
our
citizens.
the
purpose
of
the
bill
of
rights,
one
of
which
is
welding
this
nation
into
a
people
of
equal
respect
for
the
reasons
for
the
rule
of
law
can
be
served
only
we
submit
by
outlawing
the
barbarity
of
gassing,
hanging
and
electrocution
in
the
name
of
the
law.
it
is
suggested
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
counsel
for
respondent
has
conceded
that
of
the
61
persons
put
to
death
for
the
crime
of
rape,
all
61
had
been
black
then
there
would
be
what
you
call
a
prima
facie
case
that
there
was
some
sort
of
specific
racial
incidents
to
the
penalty.
well,
the
facts
are
it
is
58
out
of
61
and
i
submit
that
is
different
but
it
is
just
de
minimus.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
i
was
about
to
come
to
that
that
would
make
a
prima
facie
case
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
that
is
correct.
now
we
are
–
mr.
jack
greenberg
we
are
here
under
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
clause
of
the
constitution,
not
the
equal
protection
clause
in
which
all
the
questions
that
might
arise
on
equal
protection
case
as
to
explanation
we
would
submit
do
not
arise
when
the
only
issue
is,
is
it
unusual,
not
why
is
it
unusual,
how
is
it
unusual,
what
are
the
possible
explanations
and
so
forth.
here,
it
is
not
unusual.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well
i
won't
say
that
is
exclusively
the
meaning,
the
terms
have
been
used
in
a
variety
of
ways
but
one
meaning
certainly
is
frequency
or
rarity
on
this
case.
i
would
say
yes
that
if
a
death
penalty
for
rape
is
something
that
is,
you
know,
almost
never
used,
then
it
is
extremely
unusual
and
we
would
submit
would
be
under
doubt
that
it
is
cruel.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
but
nowadays
almost
not
at
all,
either
--
i
mean,
it
is
confined
to
a
part
of
the
country,
to
a
part
of
the
population
of
that
part
of
the
country
in
a
world
in
which
it
is
totally
non-existent
with
very
rare
of
a
sentence
that
is
the
meaning
of
unusual.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
i
have
some
figures.
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
only
georgia
figures
we
have
been
able
to
find
are
in,
i
might
say,
are
set
forth
in
our
brief
in
the
akins
case
on
page
9f,
they
are
not
comprehensive.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
is
right.
mr.
jack
greenberg
right.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
we
have
figured
only,
we
have
been
able
to
find
figures
only
from
july
1964
to
december
31,1968.
during
that
period
of
time
there
were
299
commitments
for
the
crime
of
rape,
now
that
does
not
include
for
example
probation,
sentences
and
the
variety
of
other
things
but
299
commitments
of
which
8
men
was
sentenced
to
death
but
the
large
of
those
eight
men
obviously
now
only
obviously
were
not
taken.
it
should
be
–
none
of
them
actually
were
taking
the
figure
with
circumstances
stage
of
that
period
of
time.
that
and
the
citations
to
all
available,
that
are
on
page
9f
of
the
brief
in
paragraph
3.
now,
as
to
all
the
possible
explanations,
why
it
turns
out
to
be
58
out
of
61,
respondent
says
that
the
circumstances
of
the
crime
are
to
be
considered.
the
georgia
courts
will
not
contemplate
that
evidence,
they
will
not
consider
that
evidence.
there
has
been
an
effort
to
introduce
that
kind
of
evidence
into
the
courts
of
the
state
of
georgia.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
we
conducted
a
very
extensive
study
of
capital
punishment
of
it
as
20
years
in
most
of
the
southern
states
including
the
state
of
georgia
and
every
possible
factor
that
could
occur
to
human
imagination
that
might
affect
a
juror
in
coming
to
over
crucial
penalty
was
putting
to
the
study
of
every
single
record
in
all
of
these
states.
they
were
all
examined.
the
viciousness
of
the
crime
whether
a
group
of
–
mr.
jack
greenberg
or
something.
this
was
subject
to
the
statistical
analysis
and
an
effort
was
made
to
introduce
it
in
number
of
georgia
cases
including
williams
which
is
now
pending
here
and
one
of
the
issues
in
the
williams
case
now
pending
here
is
the
fact
that
georgia
courts
would
permit
a
specific
evidence.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
it
would
not
–
but
the
evidence
we
are
talking
about
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
the
penalty
is
unconstitutional
because
it
violates
the
cruel
and
unusual
clause,
it
is
very
extensive
and
i
think
if
with
the
persuasive
evidence
which
if
i
might
say
pending
in
courts
in
the
state
of
georgia
would
show
that
38%
of
black
man
convicted
of
raping
white
woman
are
sentence
to
death.
one
half
of
1%
of
all
other
racial
combination.
mr.
jack
greenberg
on
the
matter
of
evidence
that
goes
to
the
penalty,
in
georgia’s
single
verdict
procedure,
that
sort
of
evidence
as
we
understand
the
georgia
law
is
not
admissible.
what
maybe
considered
out
a
motion
for
new
trial
is
the
evidence
in
the
case
generally
alleged.
mr.
jack
greenberg
circumstances
of
that
particular
case
but
other
evidence
might
possibly
go
defensively
such
as
let
us
say
the
mental
stage
of
the
defendant
in
the
case.
that
is
not
admissible
under
georgia
law
of
this
case.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
there
was
no
evidence
put
on
in
this
case.
there
was
an
effort
to
get
a
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
would
say,
yes
we
were
in
this
sense.
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
justice
marshall
what
occurred
in
this
case,
there
was
an
application
to
the
court
to
reform
to
the
psychiatrist
to
examine
this
defendant
and
testify
after
the
question
of
his
sanity.
the
appointment
of
psychiatrist
was
denied.
the
court
appointed
a
psychiatrist
solely
under
question
of
this
competence
for
the
trial.
mr.
jack
greenberg
we
did
not
tended
these
figures
in
this
case.
the
georgia
courts
upheld
it
there
and
it
is
admissible
in
georgia
in
other
two
or
cases
that
are
now
pending.
mr.
jack
greenberg
we
have
no
ruling
in
this
case.
there
is
