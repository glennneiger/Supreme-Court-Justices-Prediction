mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
one
thing
i
perhaps
should
make
clear,
it's
our
position
on
the
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
stewart
as
to
whether
if
there
were
shown
today
any
legitimate
legislative
basis
for
a
punishment
that
would
itself
in
the
eighth
amendment
is
referring,
the
answer
in
my
judgment
is
unmistakably
no.
the
argument
about
whether
there
is
a
legitimate
base
for
a
legislative
judgment
has
a
very,
very
small
part
in
our
brief
as
i
am
sure
the
court
has
noted.
we
have
essentially,
simply
pointed
out
that
one
of
the
reasons
why
a
court
need
not
hesitate
to
strike
down
a
rare
and
harsh
punishment
like
capital
punishment
is
that
it
is
not
taking
away
anything
that
is
very
important
to
the
state,
both
in
the
sense
that
the
only
thing
is
really
an
issue
here
is
whether
instead
of
killing
20
or
15
people
randomly
selected
a
year,
they
are
going
to
keep
them
in
prison
and
the
impact
of
that
from
all
available
determiners
is
in
current
to
punishment,
but
we
do
not
urge
that
legislature
could
not,
we
do
not
urge
in
this
forum
at
this
time
that
the
legislature
could
not
find
that
there
is
a
basis
for
boiling
an
oil.
that
i
think
really
presents
the
question
very
squarely.
mr.
george
said
and
i
think
the
state
generally
takes
the
position
that
if
boiling
an
oil
came
before
this
court,
even
though
it
had
a
legitimate
legislative
base,
even
though
a
legislature
might
find
the
boiling
in
oil
was
a
deterrent
that
somehow
the
court
could
say
that
that
was
a
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
because
it
is
“unnecessarily
cruel.”
i
want
to
simply
point
out
to
the
court,
who
is
arguing
subjective
standards
here
and
who
is
arguing
objective
standards.
how
could
this
court
say
or
how
could
mr.
george
say
that
boiling
an
oil
is
unnecessary
if
a
legislature
finds
that
in
order
to
deter
some
particularly
serious
crime
that
the
horrible
prospect
of
being
boiled
in
oil
is
all
that
we
do
it.
i
think
that
it
is
the
respondents
and
not
the
petitioners
who
are
urging
the
court
to
react
to
that
visceral
level.
our
proposition
is
i
think
the
much
more
objective
one.
it
looks
not
to
what
society
says,
but
to
what
it
does
and
we
do
not
reject
the
fact
that
41
states
have
it
on
the
statutes,
but
that
is
certainly
a
phenomenon
with
which
one
must
start,
but
one
must
also
ask
what
did
they
do
with
it.
now,
let
us
look
at
this
thing
if
we
may
for
a
moment
in
the
world
picture
and
we
are
not
talking
about
mozambique
and
liechtenstein.
we
are
not
talking
about
a
progressive
trend
which
has
brought
virtually
every
nation
in
the
western
hemisphere
with
a
possible
exception
of
paraguay
and
chile
to
abolish
the
death
penalty.
we
are
talking
about
a
progressive
trend
which
has
caused
all
of
the
english
speaking
nations
of
the
world
except
some
of
the
american
states
and
poor
states
in
australia
to
abolish
the
death
penalty.
we
are
talking
about
a
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
it
is
different
in
different
places.
in
many
places,
the
legislature
have
abolished
it
and
in
many
places
exactly
the
same
thing
has
happened
as
has
happened
in
the
united
states,
that
it
has
simply
ceased
being
applied
in
fact
and
we
think
that
the
fact
that
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
no,
no
unquestionably
not
and
in
most
countries,
of
course,
your
honor
courts
do
not
have
this
kind
of
constitutional
supervision
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
if
--
mr.
chief
justice,
if
your
honor
means,
could
the
death
--
could
the
court
find
that
the
death
penalty
is
unconstitutional
for
some
crimes
and
not
for
others,
i
believe
that
it
could
rationally,
although
i
do
not
think
it
should
or
can
on
the
indicators
available
to
the
court
in
this
country.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
might
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
well,
that
--
it
seems
to
me
that
is
a
different
question
whether
the
legislature
could.
i
do
not
think
the
court
could
under
a
general
statute
as
i
do
not
think
that
the
court
could
take
a
statute
like
california
which
says
any
first
degree
murder
imposed
the
death
penalty
or
statute
like
georgia’s
which
says
any
murder
the
death
penalty
may
be
imposed
and
say,
well,
they
can
it
apply
it
in
some
cases
and
not
in
others.
but
i
do
think
that
a
different
question
would
be
presented
if
they
are
different
and
now
our
statute
represents,
there
is
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
have
no
doubt
that
a
statute
of
that
sort
would
present
a
different
question
for
the
court
because
what
we
have
is
a
general
statute
which
proscribed
death
as
the
penalty
for
murder
or
in
the
subsequent
cases,
right.
now,
we
have
had
historical
experience
with
that.
we
know
what
our
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
oh!
yes.
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
are
several
different
statutes
mr.
justice
marshall,
in
different
states.
california
has
a
mandatory
death
penalty
statute
for
killing
by
life
termers.
it
need
not
be
a
guard
but
it
is
any
non-inmate.
there
are
five
states
though
that
have
a
statute
such
the
chief
justice
suggests
which
limit
the
penalty
to
killings
of
guards
in
the
course
of
their
duty
and
that
sort
of
thing.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
your
honor,
i
think
a
line
might
be
drawn.
i
do
not
urge
that
it
be
drawn
and
i
see
no
occasion
in
these
cases
because
no
such
statute
is
presented.
the
problem
with
those
statutes
is
that
we
had
insufficient
experience
with
them.
the
essence
of
our
submission
here,
i
think
it
is
perfectly
coined
that
we
have
had
a
very
considerable
experience
with
general
statutes
punishing
the
crime
of
murder
or
the
crime
of
rape
with
death.
and
what
we
find
when
those
statutes
are
applied,
actually
applied
by
juries
in
particular
cases
is
that
almost
never
is
the
penalty
of
death
in
fact
inflicted.
i
think
that
is
not
an
exaggeration.
now,
one
does
not
know
what
juries
would
do
with
different
kinds
of
statutes,
but
one
darn
well
knows
what
the
testimony
of
public
opinion,
of
enlightened
public
opinion
in
this
country
is
with
regard
to
general
statutes
punishing
murder
with
death.
the
--
what
juries
do
--
we
are
in
a
little
disagreement
with
i
think
the
respondents
on
the
significance
of
that.
to
start
with
it
as
we
have
pointed
out,
juries
really
only
do
return
about
a
hundred
death
verdicts
a
year.
now,
to
understand
how
small
that
is,
you
have
to
compare
it
with
the
number
of
crimes
punishable
by
death.
it
is
a
very
difficult
thing
to
do.
we
have
attempted
to
do
it
in
one
of
the
appendage
to
our
brief
in
which
you
point
out
is
that
juries
do
not
apply
the
death
penalties
perhaps
to
more
to
more
than
one
out
of
12
or
13
at
the
very
most
cases
in
which
they
could
and
maybe
a
half
or
a
third
of
those
people
are
actually
executed.
now,
notice
that
the
non-acceptance,
indeed
the
repudiation
which
this
imply.
we
have
a
country
in
which
43
jurisdictions
have
the
death
penalty
on
the
books
in
which
hundreds
and
hundreds
and
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
people
are
prosecuted
for
crimes
and
convicted
of
crimes
in
which
death
penalty
is
available.
under
the
best
of
circumstances
for
capital
punishment
where
the
--
what
is
involved
in
an
execution
is
a
secret
or
indefinite
kind
of
the
jury
does
not
proceed
or
fully
understand
where
the
people
get
the
death
penalty,
are
disproportionately
the
pariahs,
the
poor
and
racial
minorities,
it's
a
point
i
want
to
come
back
to
in
one
second,
and
where
in
addition
the
juries
are
death
qualify,
the
juries
are
returning
a
hundred
death
verdicts
here.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
it
is
impossible
to
know
in
what
percentage
of
the
case
if
the
prosecution
asked
for
it.
it
is
however
perfectly
clear
in
a
number
of
jurisdictions
that
the
prosecution
has
no
control
over
the
matter.
in
a
number
of
jurisdictions
it
is
entirely
up
to
the
jury.
the
prosecutor
cannot
waive
it
and
the
prosecutor
cannot
ask
for
it,
simply
a
matter
if
the
jury’s
discretion.
i
think
no
figures
are
available
on
the
question
of
whether
the
prosecutor
asked
for
it
although
i
would
say
that
even
the
prosecutors’
decision
not
to
ask
for
it
is
a
reflection
of
the
sentiment
of
the
total
community
so
that
i
would
not
discount
those
cases
even
if
i
knew
how
many
there
were.
the
point
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no.
no,
that
is
certainly
clear
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
the
figures
that
are
available
do
not
discriminate
so
that
the
one
out
of
12
or
13
figures
is
a
total
figure
that
does
not
discriminate
between
a
judgment
and
jury
sentencing
where
prosecutors
have
or
have
not
asked.
all
we
know
is
that
out
of
that
number
of
capital
cases
that
is
the
number
of
death
sentences
that
are
in
fact
imposed
by
the
sentencing.
one
important
factor
is
that
the
figures
we
have,
the
figures
i
am
talking
about
a
hundred
year,
run
through
1968,
when
witherspoon
was
decided.
so
what
we
are
talking
about
is
the
number
of
sentences
imposed
principally
by
juries
because
although
there
are
some
judge
sentences
in
there,
most
of
these
are
plainly
jury
sentences,
by
juries
from
whom
all
persons
against
capital
punishment
had
been
excluded.
now
this
is
the
group
that
mr.
george
wants
us
to
take
as
the
indicators
of
public
symptom.
you
are
already
crooning
out
all
of
those
people
who
oppose
the
capital
punishment.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
am
--
how
many
jurisdictions
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
to
my
knowledge
there
are
2
jurisdictions,
maryland
and
illinois
where
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
requires
the
concurrence
of
the
judge
with
the
jury,
that
is
the
jury’s
verdict
is
either
advisory
or
the
judge
must
concur
in
the
jury’s
verdict
before
it
can
be
imposed.
in
all
other
jurisdictions,
it
is
the
jury
which
makes
the
sentencing
decision
unless
the
jury
is
waived.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
oh!
i
am
--
i
am
then
quite
misinformed.
i
had
understood
that
it
was.
if
--
this
is
rather
thoroughly
canvassed
in
the
briefs
in
maxwell
versus
bishop
and
i
think
the
statutory
section
is
set
out
there.
if
the
court
should
want
to
refer
to
them
for
reference,
i
had
understood
that
it
was
true
in
all
states
that
the
jury
made
the
determination
except
those
two
but
there
may
be
local
differences
of
--
that
i
am
not
aware
of.
the
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
on
sentences,
yes.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
oh!
it
is
since
united
states
v.
jackson
and
it
is
common
that
if
the
jury
is
waived
the
judge
may
impose
the
death
penalty,
yes,
that
certainly
is
true.
the
jury
is
sort
of
primary
sentencing
instrument
in
practice
because
it's
generally
--
jury
does
not
interact
with.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
there
are,
again,
judicially
noticeable
figures
on
this.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record.
there
is
no
evidence
that
was
presented,
but
the
figures
that
perfectly
frames
the
national
prison
statistics,
judge
executes
black
people.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
want
to
make
some
reference
to
the
--
as
to
the
state
of
the
record
generally
because
there
is
an
awful
lot
of
talk
here
about
facts,
about
what
the
los
angeles
police
department
says
about
deterrence,
about
who
gets
the
death
penalty,
unpublished
figures
in
the
georgia
bureau
of
prisons,
unpublished
figures
in
the
california
department
of
corrections,
i
make
very
point
that,
we
have
been
asking
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
from
all
of
these
factual,
a
lot
of
courts
for
a
long
time.
nobody
has
ever
given
one
to
it.
the
california
supreme
court
judge
(inaudible)
evans
rests
upon
a
record
in
which
the
california
supreme
court
decided
that
case
on
authority,
other
case
in
which
we
had
asked
for
such
a
hearing
and
had
not
been
given
to
him.
we
are
very
far
from
satisfied
with
the
nature
of
the
factual
evidence
presented
here,
but
we
think
from
the
factual
evidence
that
is
judicially
noticeable
which
does
not
include
corrections,
departments,
or
courts
in
an
unpublished
forum,
that
enough
appears
so
that
the
court
can
call
the
death
penalty
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
now,
if
however
the
court
has
any
concern
with
any
of
this
factual
questions,
for
instance,
from
deterrence
to
who
gets
the
death
penalty,
any
of
these
things,
an
evidentiary
hearing
would
be
the
proper
way
to
resolve
that
matter
and
in
the
akins
case,
at
least
the
case
can
be
taken
in
such
a
way
to
get
that
hearing.
now,
the
--
i
would
turn
to
this
subject
of
rarity
and
discrimination
because
the
significance
of
both
rarity
and
who
--
and
the
question,
who
gets
the
death
penalty
is
twofold.
first
of
all,
when
a
nation
decides
with
a
growing
crime
scare,
burgeoning
population,
sentences
a
few
people
to
death,
were
in
fact
sentenced
to
death
and
execute
the
people
you
fear
of
and
does
this
against
the
background
where
the
ideological
debate
where
the
content
of
this
debate
about
capital
punishment
makes
unmistakably
clear
why
this
is
happening
historically
because
capital
punishment
is
regarded
as
indecent,
as
inconsistent
with
civilized
standards
today
then
that
manifests
a
repudiation.
it's
quite
different
from
what
is
manifested
by
the
maintenance
of
the
statutes
on
the
books.
that
is
the
second
aspect
of
it.
the
very
fact
that
capital
punishment
comes
to
be
as
rarely
and
is
infrequently
and
is
discriminatorily
imposed
as
it
is,
takes
the
pressure
of
the
legislature
quite
simply
to
do
anything
about
it.
for
one
reason
why
the
eighth
amendment
must
be
measured
not
only
by
legislative
disapproval,
but
by
popular
disapproval
in
terms
of
what
juries
and
judges
and
prosecutors
do
in
fact
is
that
there
are
in
fact
more
than
one
way
to
skin
a
cat.
and
that
a
penalty
can
be
repudiated
by
public
opinion,
every
bit
as
thoroughly
by
the
legislatures
making
it
optional
and
then
nobody
has
ever
applying
it
as
by
the
legislature's
repeal
of
it
and
this
goes
back
to
the
chief
justice’s
question,
how
has
it
been
done
internationally?
in
some
places
it
has
been
done
by
legislative
repeal.
in
other
places
what
has
happened
is
exactly
what
happened
in
this
country,
it
simply
falls
into
disputes
and
when
it
falls
into
disputes,
when
there
are
only
a
very,
very
few
people
and
those
predominantly
poor
black,
personally
ugly
and
socially
unacceptable,
there
simply
is
no
pressure
in
the
legislature
to
take
it
off.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
how
many
in
death
row?
a
hundred
and
five
on
death
row
in
california
to
my
--
to
my
knowledge
at
the
moment.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
oh!
about,
i
would
say
85
to
90.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
well,
there
are
number
of
--
i
think
of
essential
points
here,
few
is
of
course
a
relative
matter.
what
you
are
talking
about
is
an
accumulation
on
death
row
over
a
period
of
time
for
12
or
13
years.
you
are
talking
about
80
people
in
a
prison
system
that
houses
thousands
and
thousands
and
thousands
of
people.
you
are
talking
about
and
i
think
this
is
relevant,
you
are
taking
about
80
people
of
whom
at
that
time
25
or
30,
actually
probably
up
around
30
were
members
of
minority
groups.
this
by
the
way
is
not
a
factor
in
california’s
figures.
one
of
the
reasons
why
i
have
great
concern
about
california’s
putting
them
forward
as
though
they
were
judicially
noticeable,
but
the
only
racial
figures
california
give
are
for
1970.
it
is
very
strange
that
thinking
--
very
clearly
the
1970
was
strange
here
in
california
because
the
last
published
national
figures
show
that
out
of
59
people
on
death
row
in
california,
25
were
black.
now,
the
california
figures
show
that
out
of
a
hundred
now,
25
are
black.
there
is
something,
you
know,
strange
going
on
there
which
you
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
it
is
very
difficult
to
know.
there
are
no
published
figures
to
tell
us
that.
what
california
does
compared
to
the
received
from
court
1970
and
one
year
is
no
basis
for
making
any
kind
of
a
judgment.
it
is
true
though
that
california
counts
chicanos
as
white
for
these
purposes,
something
which
for
one
who
lives
in
california,
i
point
rather
strange
in
terms
of
the
question,
who
there
is
that
brought
on
the
penalty?
the
point
essentially
is
that
when
it
is
this
group
of
people
who
in
fact
suffer,
realistically
the
pressure
on
the
legislature
is
not
the
same.
however,
little
we
are
willing
to
bear
the
death
penalty
in
its
general
application,
we
are
still
less
willing
to
bear
it
as
applied
to
us.
now,
the
court
has
been
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
the
latest
available
figure
to
me
your
honor
is
697.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
i
do
not
think
so.
i
think
as
a
matter
of
fact,
public
opinion
has
been
low
in
a
very
significant
way
by
the
failure
of
executions
in
recent
years.
i
think
the
public
has
--
as
in
large
measure
stopped
thinking
about
the
problem.
i
think
that
it
is
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
do
not
know
whether
it
would
or
would
not
if
you
actually
started
killing
people.
i
am
quite
confident
it
would
not
until
you
start
killing
people.
public
is
quite
graphic
in
a
way
it
thinks
about
things.
put
one
execution
out
there,
take
one
life,
people
get
very
excited,
but
tell
them
that
tomorrow
or
the
next
day
a
life
maybe
taken
when
one
has
not
been
taken
since
june
2
of
1967
and
they
don't
think
about
it.
i
think
it
would
cost,
i
think
it
would
be
constitutionally
intolerable
to
us,
the
resumption
of
execution,
to
activate
any
kind
of
public
sentiment.
but
even
if
you
had
that
public
sentiment
activated,
the
point
essentially
remains
that
it
is
not,
you
are
not
capable
of
generating
the
kind
of
legislative
or
public
disapprobation
of
a
penalty
which
is
asking
a
forum
so
as
to
be
applied
and
which
is
in
fact
applied
to
very,
very
relatively
and
to
essentially
ugly
minority
group
members
as
you
are
to
a
generally
applicable
penalty.
now,
i
would
like
to
serve
--
save
some
time
for
rebuttal
in
this
matter,
but
the
point
made
by
several
of
the
respondents
said
that
the
death
penalty
somehow
--
the
fact
that
the
institution
in
the
society
would
fall
apart
if
this
court
laid
it
hands
on
it,
is
not
new.
if
i
may
read
just
for
a
moment
from
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
is
not
new.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
is
not
new.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
if
i
may
read
for
a
moment
from
lord
ellenborough
speaking
in
the
house
of
lords
in
1813
on
a
bill
for
abolishing
the
death
penalty
for
the
crime
of
privately
stealing
the
amount
of
five
shillings
from
a
shop,
lord
ellenborough
after
saying,
how
but
by
the
enactment
of
this
capital
punishment
law,
the
cottages
of
the
industrious
poor
to
be
protected,
what
other
security
has
a
poor
peasant
when
he
and
his
wife
come
home
that
his
clothing
would
be
safe
other
than
the
death
penalty.
those
are
on
to
say,
your
lordships
have
told
what
is
extremely
true
that
the
number
of
people
actually
put
to
death
for
stealing
five
shillings
from
a
shop
is
very
small.
and
this
circumstance
is
urged
as
the
reason
for
the
repeal
of
the
law.
but
before
your
lordships
are
induced
to
consent
to
such
repeal,
i
beg
to
call
to
your
consideration
the
number
of
innocent
persons
who
might
have
been
plundered
of
their
property
or
destroyed
by
midnight
murderers
if
the
law
now
sought
to
be
repealed
had
not
been
in
existence,
a
law
upon
which
all
the
retailed
trade
of
this
commercial
country
depends
in
which
i
for
one
do
not
consent
to
be
put
in
jeopardy.
nevertheless,
the
bill
making
it
a
capital
offense
to
steal
five
shillings
from
a
shop
was
in
fact
repealed,
england
did
not
fall
there.
i
think
that
all
of
the
available
evidence
which
is
judicially
noticeable
makes
it
perfectly
point
that
a
judicial
ruling
by
this
court
applying
the
eighth
amendment
in
the
way
in
which
we
believe
it
was
meant
to
be
applied
and
in
judging
this
repudiated
penalty,
a
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
to
take
from
the
state
nothing
to
which
they
are
entitled.
if
i
may
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
your
honor?
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
eighth
amendment
we
see
is
a
limitation
somewhat
like
before.
it
is
a
limitation
on
means
that
says
that
the
legislature
may
not
use
cruel
penalties,
cruel
and
unusual
penalties,
even
though
they
may
serve
legitimate
cause,
so
just
because
men
engage
in
unlawful
searches
and
seizures
even
though
there
may
be
a
purpose
for
them.
now,
we
are
--
i
ought
to
point
out
we
are
limited
to
that
on
this
record
because
of
this
ineluctable
fact
that
we
cannot
get
an
evidentiary
hearing
on
all
of
the
issues
your
honor
raises.
i
think
on
evidence
which
could
be
presented,
we
could
show
that
none
of
the
judgments
your
honors
supposes
could
rationally
be
made.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
but
on
this
record
it
is
our
submission
that
accepting
each
and
every
one
of
those
propositions,
the
death
is
a
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court.
we
--
on
one
point
i
essentially
do
not
disagree
with
mrs.
beasley.
i
think
juries
are
in
many
ways
the
conscience
of
the
community
although
i
think
other
organs
of
government,
prosecutors
and
judges
are
as
well
and
our
whole
case
rests
on
what
juries
and
prosecutors
and
the
other
agencies
of
government
have
done.
what
they
have
done
is
to
refuse
to
impose
the
death
penalty.
the
question
then
arises,
well,
why
do
we
not
leave
them
that
way.
if
they
are
refusing
then
why
should
court
step
in.
why
should
not
it
just
die
of
its
own
way?
the
answer
to
that
is
the
case
like
furman
versus
georgia.
where
what
you
have
is
a
regular
garden
variety,
burglary,
murder.
unintended
killing,
somebody
shot
through
the
door,
a
case
submitted
on
the
theory
that
it
was
an
unintended
killing,
there
are
thousands
of
these.
the
jury
comes
back
with
death,
the
defendant
is
black,
the
victim
is
white,
it
is
all
the
aggravation
in
the
case.
the
state
which
distinguishes
between
torture
and
the
mere
extinguishment
of
human
life
cannot
see
that
this
case
is
different
from
the
aggravated
cases.
but
the
jury
is
allowed
in
every
case
to
return
a
death
penalty.
there
are
georgia
figures
in
this
record.
i
do
not
think
they
are
judicially
noticeable
but
they
are
in
this
record,
33
people
on
death
row,
27
of
them
of
black,
six
whites.
the
reasons
why
a
juries
cannot
be
permitted
go
on
doing
what
they
have
done
and
slowly,
inexorably
do
away
with
the
death
penalty
themselves,
is
that
an
individual
in
particular
cases
there
is
going
to
be
a
regression
and
depending
largely
on
the
color
of
the
defendant
and
in
the
ugliness
of
his
person
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
and
it
is
that
kind
of
selectiveness
which
we
think
that
the
death
penalty
forbids.
now,
i
believe
the
lower
court
cases
somewhat
differently
than
mrs.
beasley
does,
i
would
say
that
the
real
development
in
the
eighth
amendment
area
throughout
this
century
has
been
very
pointedly
development
in
the
prison
cases
which
has
the
court
just
recognized
in
haines
and
kerner.
what
has
happened
there
is
that
the
eighth
amendment
has
been
taken
and
given
a
whole
new
meaning
to
respond
to
a
new
problem
and
new
conditions.
what
we
have
in
the
capital
punish
plenary
is
the
exactly
the
same
thing.
and
our
point,
i
repeat
again
with
regard
to
race
is
not
or
poverty
is
not
discrimination,
we
have
not
proved
it.
on
these
records,
it
could
not
be.
what
i
am
saying
is
to
exactly
what
is
happening
in
capital
punishments,
the
rare
arbitrary,
usually
discriminatory
but
unprovably
discriminatory
infliction
of
a
punishment,
escapes
all
other
kinds
of
constitutional
control,
due
process,
equal
protection
and
escapes
the
public
pressure
that
keep
legislatures
acting
decently
unless
there
is
something
in
the
constitution
that
degrades.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
no.
we
do
not
but
i
think
the
basis
of
it
can
be
fairly
simply
stated.
the
court
--
the
concept
to
judicial
notice
is
essentially
that
when
a
writing
is
put
to
there
in
the
public
domain
which
people
may
rebut,
which
people
may
study
and
answer
that
if
a
crime
is
judicially
noticeable
because
its
availability
for
professional
criticisms
makes
it
reliable.
now,
when
a
state
takes
figures
out
of
the
state
department
of
correction
records,
that
has
never
been
printed
anywhere
which
was
(inaudible)
is
un-ascertainable,
whose
significance
is
not
subject
to
criticisms,
that
is
not
judicially
noticeable.
but
when
you
have
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
one
thing
i
perhaps
should
make
clear,
it's
our
position
on
the
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
stewart
as
to
whether
if
there
were
shown
today
any
legitimate
legislative
basis
for
a
punishment
that
would
itself
in
the
eighth
amendment
is
referring,
the
answer
in
my
judgment
is
unmistakably
no.
the
argument
about
whether
there
is
a
legitimate
base
for
a
legislative
judgment
has
a
very,
very
small
part
in
our
brief
as
i
am
sure
the
court
has
noted.
we
have
essentially,
simply
pointed
out
that
one
of
the
reasons
why
a
court
need
not
hesitate
to
strike
down
a
rare
and
harsh
punishment
like
capital
punishment
is
that
it
is
not
taking
away
anything
that
is
very
important
to
the
state,
both
in
the
sense
that
the
only
thing
is
really
an
issue
here
is
whether
instead
of
killing
20
or
15
people
randomly
selected
a
year,
they
are
going
to
keep
them
in
prison
and
the
impact
of
that
from
all
available
determiners
is
in
current
to
punishment,
but
we
do
not
urge
that
legislature
could
not,
we
do
not
urge
in
this
forum
at
this
time
that
the
legislature
could
not
find
that
there
is
a
basis
for
boiling
an
oil.
that
i
think
really
presents
the
question
very
squarely.
mr.
george
said
and
i
think
the
state
generally
takes
the
position
that
if
boiling
an
oil
came
before
this
court,
even
though
it
had
a
legitimate
legislative
base,
even
though
a
legislature
might
find
the
boiling
in
oil
was
a
deterrent
that
somehow
the
court
could
say
that
that
was
a
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
because
it
is
“unnecessarily
cruel.”
i
want
to
simply
point
out
to
the
court,
who
is
arguing
subjective
standards
here
and
who
is
arguing
objective
standards.
how
could
this
court
say
or
how
could
mr.
george
say
that
boiling
an
oil
is
unnecessary
if
a
legislature
finds
that
in
order
to
deter
some
particularly
serious
crime
that
the
horrible
prospect
of
being
boiled
in
oil
is
all
that
we
do
it.
i
think
that
it
is
the
respondents
and
not
the
petitioners
who
are
urging
the
court
to
react
to
that
visceral
level.
our
proposition
is
i
think
the
much
more
objective
one.
it
looks
not
to
what
society
says,
but
to
what
it
does
and
we
do
not
reject
the
fact
that
41
states
have
it
on
the
statutes,
but
that
is
certainly
a
phenomenon
with
which
one
must
start,
but
one
must
also
ask
what
did
they
do
with
it.
now,
let
us
look
at
this
thing
if
we
may
for
a
moment
in
the
world
picture
and
we
are
not
talking
about
mozambique
and
liechtenstein.
we
are
not
talking
about
a
progressive
trend
which
has
brought
virtually
every
nation
in
the
western
hemisphere
with
a
possible
exception
of
paraguay
and
chile
to
abolish
the
death
penalty.
we
are
talking
about
a
progressive
trend
which
has
caused
all
of
the
english
speaking
nations
of
the
world
except
some
of
the
american
states
and
poor
states
in
australia
to
abolish
the
death
penalty.
we
are
talking
about
a
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
it
is
different
in
different
places.
in
many
places,
the
legislature
have
abolished
it
and
in
many
places
exactly
the
same
thing
has
happened
as
has
happened
in
the
united
states,
that
it
has
simply
ceased
being
applied
in
fact
and
we
think
that
the
fact
that
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
no,
no
unquestionably
not
and
in
most
countries,
of
course,
your
honor
courts
do
not
have
this
kind
of
constitutional
supervision
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
if
--
mr.
chief
justice,
if
your
honor
means,
could
the
death
--
could
the
court
find
that
the
death
penalty
is
unconstitutional
for
some
crimes
and
not
for
others,
i
believe
that
it
could
rationally,
although
i
do
not
think
it
should
or
can
on
the
indicators
available
to
the
court
in
this
country.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
might
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
well,
that
--
it
seems
to
me
that
is
a
different
question
whether
the
legislature
could.
i
do
not
think
the
court
could
under
a
general
statute
as
i
do
not
think
that
the
court
could
take
a
statute
like
california
which
says
any
first
degree
murder
imposed
the
death
penalty
or
statute
like
georgia’s
which
says
any
murder
the
death
penalty
may
be
imposed
and
say,
well,
they
can
it
apply
it
in
some
cases
and
not
in
others.
but
i
do
think
that
a
different
question
would
be
presented
if
they
are
different
and
now
our
statute
represents,
there
is
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
have
no
doubt
that
a
statute
of
that
sort
would
present
a
different
question
for
the
court
because
what
we
have
is
a
general
statute
which
proscribed
death
as
the
penalty
for
murder
or
in
the
subsequent
cases,
right.
now,
we
have
had
historical
experience
with
that.
we
know
what
our
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
oh!
yes.
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
are
several
different
statutes
mr.
justice
marshall,
in
different
states.
california
has
a
mandatory
death
penalty
statute
for
killing
by
life
termers.
it
need
not
be
a
guard
but
it
is
any
non-inmate.
there
are
five
states
though
that
have
a
statute
such
the
chief
justice
suggests
which
limit
the
penalty
to
killings
of
guards
in
the
course
of
their
duty
and
that
sort
of
thing.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
your
honor,
i
think
a
line
might
be
drawn.
i
do
not
urge
that
it
be
drawn
and
i
see
no
occasion
in
these
cases
because
no
such
statute
is
presented.
the
problem
with
those
statutes
is
that
we
had
insufficient
experience
with
them.
the
essence
of
our
submission
here,
i
think
it
is
perfectly
coined
that
we
have
had
a
very
considerable
experience
with
general
statutes
punishing
the
crime
of
murder
or
the
crime
of
rape
with
death.
and
what
we
find
when
those
statutes
are
applied,
actually
applied
by
juries
in
particular
cases
is
that
almost
never
is
the
penalty
of
death
in
fact
inflicted.
i
think
that
is
not
an
exaggeration.
now,
one
does
not
know
what
juries
would
do
with
different
kinds
of
statutes,
but
one
darn
well
knows
what
the
testimony
of
public
opinion,
of
enlightened
public
opinion
in
this
country
is
with
regard
to
general
statutes
punishing
murder
with
death.
the
--
what
juries
do
--
we
are
in
a
little
disagreement
with
i
think
the
respondents
on
the
significance
of
that.
to
start
with
it
as
we
have
pointed
out,
juries
really
only
do
return
about
a
hundred
death
verdicts
a
year.
now,
to
understand
how
small
that
is,
you
have
to
compare
it
with
the
number
of
crimes
punishable
by
death.
it
is
a
very
difficult
thing
to
do.
we
have
attempted
to
do
it
in
one
of
the
appendage
to
our
brief
in
which
you
point
out
is
that
juries
do
not
apply
the
death
penalties
perhaps
to
more
to
more
than
one
out
of
12
or
13
at
the
very
most
cases
in
which
they
could
and
maybe
a
half
or
a
third
of
those
people
are
actually
executed.
now,
notice
that
the
non-acceptance,
indeed
the
repudiation
which
this
imply.
we
have
a
country
in
which
43
jurisdictions
have
the
death
penalty
on
the
books
in
which
hundreds
and
hundreds
and
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
people
are
prosecuted
for
crimes
and
convicted
of
crimes
in
which
death
penalty
is
available.
under
the
best
of
circumstances
for
capital
punishment
where
the
--
what
is
involved
in
an
execution
is
a
secret
or
indefinite
kind
of
the
jury
does
not
proceed
or
fully
understand
where
the
people
get
the
death
penalty,
are
disproportionately
the
pariahs,
the
poor
and
racial
minorities,
it's
a
point
i
want
to
come
back
to
in
one
second,
and
where
in
addition
the
juries
are
death
qualify,
the
juries
are
returning
a
hundred
death
verdicts
here.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
it
is
impossible
to
know
in
what
percentage
of
the
case
if
the
prosecution
asked
for
it.
it
is
however
perfectly
clear
in
a
number
of
jurisdictions
that
the
prosecution
has
no
control
over
the
matter.
in
a
number
of
jurisdictions
it
is
entirely
up
to
the
jury.
the
prosecutor
cannot
waive
it
and
the
prosecutor
cannot
ask
for
it,
simply
a
matter
if
the
jury’s
discretion.
i
think
no
figures
are
available
on
the
question
of
whether
the
prosecutor
asked
for
it
although
i
would
say
that
even
the
prosecutors’
decision
not
to
ask
for
it
is
a
reflection
of
the
sentiment
of
the
total
community
so
that
i
would
not
discount
those
cases
even
if
i
knew
how
many
there
were.
the
point
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no.
no,
that
is
certainly
clear
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
the
figures
that
are
available
do
not
discriminate
so
that
the
one
out
of
12
or
13
figures
is
a
total
figure
that
does
not
discriminate
between
a
judgment
and
jury
sentencing
where
prosecutors
have
or
have
not
asked.
all
we
know
is
that
out
of
that
number
of
capital
cases
that
is
the
number
of
death
sentences
that
are
in
fact
imposed
by
the
sentencing.
one
important
factor
is
that
the
figures
we
have,
the
figures
i
am
talking
about
a
hundred
year,
run
through
1968,
when
witherspoon
was
decided.
so
what
we
are
talking
about
is
the
number
of
sentences
imposed
principally
by
juries
because
although
there
are
some
judge
sentences
in
there,
most
of
these
are
plainly
jury
sentences,
by
juries
from
whom
all
persons
against
capital
punishment
had
been
excluded.
now
this
is
the
group
that
mr.
george
wants
us
to
take
as
the
indicators
of
public
symptom.
you
are
already
crooning
out
all
of
those
people
who
oppose
the
capital
punishment.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
am
--
how
many
jurisdictions
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
to
my
knowledge
there
are
2
jurisdictions,
maryland
and
illinois
where
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
requires
the
concurrence
of
the
judge
with
the
jury,
that
is
the
jury’s
verdict
is
either
advisory
or
the
judge
must
concur
in
the
jury’s
verdict
before
it
can
be
imposed.
in
all
other
jurisdictions,
it
is
the
jury
which
makes
the
sentencing
decision
unless
the
jury
is
waived.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
oh!
i
am
--
i
am
then
quite
misinformed.
i
had
understood
that
it
was.
if
--
this
is
rather
thoroughly
canvassed
in
the
briefs
in
maxwell
versus
bishop
and
i
think
the
statutory
section
is
set
out
there.
if
the
court
should
want
to
refer
to
them
for
reference,
i
had
understood
that
it
was
true
in
all
states
that
the
jury
made
the
determination
except
those
two
but
there
may
be
local
differences
of
--
that
i
am
not
aware
of.
the
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
on
sentences,
yes.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
oh!
it
is
since
united
states
v.
jackson
and
it
is
common
that
if
the
jury
is
waived
the
judge
may
impose
the
death
penalty,
yes,
that
certainly
is
true.
the
jury
is
sort
of
primary
sentencing
instrument
in
practice
because
it's
generally
--
jury
does
not
interact
with.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
there
are,
again,
judicially
noticeable
figures
on
this.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record.
there
is
no
evidence
that
was
presented,
but
the
figures
that
perfectly
frames
the
national
prison
statistics,
judge
executes
black
people.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
want
to
make
some
reference
to
the
--
as
to
the
state
of
the
record
generally
because
there
is
an
awful
lot
of
talk
here
about
facts,
about
what
the
los
angeles
police
department
says
about
deterrence,
about
who
gets
the
death
penalty,
unpublished
figures
in
the
georgia
bureau
of
prisons,
unpublished
figures
in
the
california
department
of
corrections,
i
make
very
point
that,
we
have
been
asking
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
from
all
of
these
factual,
a
lot
of
courts
for
a
long
time.
nobody
has
ever
given
one
to
it.
the
california
supreme
court
judge
(inaudible)
evans
rests
upon
a
record
in
which
the
california
supreme
court
decided
that
case
on
authority,
other
case
in
which
we
had
asked
for
such
a
hearing
and
had
not
been
given
to
him.
we
are
very
far
from
satisfied
with
the
nature
of
the
factual
evidence
presented
here,
but
we
think
from
the
factual
evidence
that
is
judicially
noticeable
which
does
not
include
corrections,
departments,
or
courts
in
an
unpublished
forum,
that
enough
appears
so
that
the
court
can
call
the
death
penalty
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
now,
if
however
the
court
has
any
concern
with
any
of
this
factual
questions,
for
instance,
from
deterrence
to
who
gets
the
death
penalty,
any
of
these
things,
an
evidentiary
hearing
would
be
the
proper
way
to
resolve
that
matter
and
in
the
akins
case,
at
least
the
case
can
be
taken
in
such
a
way
to
get
that
hearing.
now,
the
--
i
would
turn
to
this
subject
of
rarity
and
discrimination
because
the
significance
of
both
rarity
and
who
--
and
the
question,
who
gets
the
death
penalty
is
twofold.
first
of
all,
when
a
nation
decides
with
a
growing
crime
scare,
burgeoning
population,
sentences
a
few
people
to
death,
were
in
fact
sentenced
to
death
and
execute
the
people
you
fear
of
and
does
this
against
the
background
where
the
ideological
debate
where
the
content
of
this
debate
about
capital
punishment
makes
unmistakably
clear
why
this
is
happening
historically
because
capital
punishment
is
regarded
as
indecent,
as
inconsistent
with
civilized
standards
today
then
that
manifests
a
repudiation.
it's
quite
different
from
what
is
manifested
by
the
maintenance
of
the
statutes
on
the
books.
that
is
the
second
aspect
of
it.
the
very
fact
that
capital
punishment
comes
to
be
as
rarely
and
is
infrequently
and
is
discriminatorily
imposed
as
it
is,
takes
the
pressure
of
the
legislature
quite
simply
to
do
anything
about
it.
for
one
reason
why
the
eighth
amendment
must
be
measured
not
only
by
legislative
disapproval,
but
by
popular
disapproval
in
terms
of
what
juries
and
judges
and
prosecutors
do
in
fact
is
that
there
are
in
fact
more
than
one
way
to
skin
a
cat.
and
that
a
penalty
can
be
repudiated
by
public
opinion,
every
bit
as
thoroughly
by
the
legislatures
making
it
optional
and
then
nobody
has
ever
applying
it
as
by
the
legislature's
repeal
of
it
and
this
goes
back
to
the
chief
justice’s
question,
how
has
it
been
done
internationally?
in
some
places
it
has
been
done
by
legislative
repeal.
in
other
places
what
has
happened
is
exactly
what
happened
in
this
country,
it
simply
falls
into
disputes
and
when
it
falls
into
disputes,
when
there
are
only
a
very,
very
few
people
and
those
predominantly
poor
black,
personally
ugly
and
socially
unacceptable,
there
simply
is
no
pressure
in
the
legislature
to
take
it
off.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
how
many
in
death
row?
a
hundred
and
five
on
death
row
in
california
to
my
--
to
my
knowledge
at
the
moment.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
oh!
about,
i
would
say
85
to
90.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
well,
there
are
number
of
--
i
think
of
essential
points
here,
few
is
of
course
a
relative
matter.
what
you
are
talking
about
is
an
accumulation
on
death
row
over
a
period
of
time
for
12
or
13
years.
you
are
talking
about
80
people
in
a
prison
system
that
houses
thousands
and
thousands
and
thousands
of
people.
you
are
talking
about
and
i
think
this
is
relevant,
you
are
taking
about
80
people
of
whom
at
that
time
25
or
30,
actually
probably
up
around
30
were
members
of
minority
groups.
this
by
the
way
is
not
a
factor
in
california’s
figures.
one
of
the
reasons
why
i
have
great
concern
about
california’s
putting
them
forward
as
though
they
were
judicially
noticeable,
but
the
only
racial
figures
california
give
are
for
1970.
it
is
very
strange
that
thinking
--
very
clearly
the
1970
was
strange
here
in
california
because
the
last
published
national
figures
show
that
out
of
59
people
on
death
row
in
california,
25
were
black.
now,
the
california
figures
show
that
out
of
a
hundred
now,
25
are
black.
there
is
something,
you
know,
strange
going
on
there
which
you
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
it
is
very
difficult
to
know.
there
are
no
published
figures
to
tell
us
that.
what
california
does
compared
to
the
received
from
court
1970
and
one
year
is
no
basis
for
making
any
kind
of
a
judgment.
it
is
true
though
that
california
counts
chicanos
as
white
for
these
purposes,
something
which
for
one
who
lives
in
california,
i
point
rather
strange
in
terms
of
the
question,
who
there
is
that
brought
on
the
penalty?
the
point
essentially
is
that
when
it
is
this
group
of
people
who
in
fact
suffer,
realistically
the
pressure
on
the
legislature
is
not
the
same.
however,
little
we
are
willing
to
bear
the
death
penalty
in
its
general
application,
we
are
still
less
willing
to
bear
it
as
applied
to
us.
now,
the
court
has
been
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
the
latest
available
figure
to
me
your
honor
is
697.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
i
do
not
think
so.
i
think
as
a
matter
of
fact,
public
opinion
has
been
low
in
a
very
significant
way
by
the
failure
of
executions
in
recent
years.
i
think
the
public
has
--
as
in
large
measure
stopped
thinking
about
the
problem.
i
think
that
it
is
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
do
not
know
whether
it
would
or
would
not
if
you
actually
started
killing
people.
i
am
quite
confident
it
would
not
until
you
start
killing
people.
public
is
quite
graphic
in
a
way
it
thinks
about
things.
put
one
execution
out
there,
take
one
life,
people
get
very
excited,
but
tell
them
that
tomorrow
or
the
next
day
a
life
maybe
taken
when
one
has
not
been
taken
since
june
2
of
1967
and
they
don't
think
about
it.
i
think
it
would
cost,
i
think
it
would
be
constitutionally
intolerable
to
us,
the
resumption
of
execution,
to
activate
any
kind
of
public
sentiment.
but
even
if
you
had
that
public
sentiment
activated,
the
point
essentially
remains
that
it
is
not,
you
are
not
capable
of
generating
the
kind
of
legislative
or
public
disapprobation
of
a
penalty
which
is
asking
a
forum
so
as
to
be
applied
and
which
is
in
fact
applied
to
very,
very
relatively
and
to
essentially
ugly
minority
group
members
as
you
are
to
a
generally
applicable
penalty.
now,
i
would
like
to
serve
--
save
some
time
for
rebuttal
in
this
matter,
but
the
point
made
by
several
of
the
respondents
said
that
the
death
penalty
somehow
--
the
fact
that
the
institution
in
the
society
would
fall
apart
if
this
court
laid
it
hands
on
it,
is
not
new.
if
i
may
read
just
for
a
moment
from
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
is
not
new.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
is
not
new.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
if
i
may
read
for
a
moment
from
lord
ellenborough
speaking
in
the
house
of
lords
in
1813
on
a
bill
for
abolishing
the
death
penalty
for
the
crime
of
privately
stealing
the
amount
of
five
shillings
from
a
shop,
lord
ellenborough
after
saying,
how
but
by
the
enactment
of
this
capital
punishment
law,
the
cottages
of
the
industrious
poor
to
be
protected,
what
other
security
has
a
poor
peasant
when
he
and
his
wife
come
home
that
his
clothing
would
be
safe
other
than
the
death
penalty.
those
are
on
to
say,
your
lordships
have
told
what
is
extremely
true
that
the
number
of
people
actually
put
to
death
for
stealing
five
shillings
from
a
shop
is
very
small.
and
this
circumstance
is
urged
as
the
reason
for
the
repeal
of
the
law.
but
before
your
lordships
are
induced
to
consent
to
such
repeal,
i
beg
to
call
to
your
consideration
the
number
of
innocent
persons
who
might
have
been
plundered
of
their
property
or
destroyed
by
midnight
murderers
if
the
law
now
sought
to
be
repealed
had
not
been
in
existence,
a
law
upon
which
all
the
retailed
trade
of
this
commercial
country
depends
in
which
i
for
one
do
not
consent
to
be
put
in
jeopardy.
nevertheless,
the
bill
making
it
a
capital
offense
to
steal
five
shillings
from
a
shop
was
in
fact
repealed,
england
did
not
fall
there.
i
think
that
all
of
the
available
evidence
which
is
judicially
noticeable
makes
it
perfectly
point
that
a
judicial
ruling
by
this
court
applying
the
eighth
amendment
in
the
way
in
which
we
believe
it
was
meant
to
be
applied
and
in
judging
this
repudiated
penalty,
a
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
to
take
from
the
state
nothing
to
which
they
are
entitled.
if
i
may
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
your
honor?
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
eighth
amendment
we
see
is
a
limitation
somewhat
like
before.
it
is
a
limitation
on
means
that
says
that
the
legislature
may
not
use
cruel
penalties,
cruel
and
unusual
penalties,
even
though
they
may
serve
legitimate
cause,
so
just
because
men
engage
in
unlawful
searches
and
seizures
even
though
there
may
be
a
purpose
for
them.
now,
we
are
--
i
ought
to
point
out
we
are
limited
to
that
on
this
record
because
of
this
ineluctable
fact
that
we
cannot
get
an
evidentiary
hearing
on
all
of
the
issues
your
honor
raises.
i
think
on
evidence
which
could
be
presented,
we
could
show
that
none
of
the
judgments
your
honors
supposes
could
rationally
be
made.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
but
on
this
record
it
is
our
submission
that
accepting
each
and
every
one
of
those
propositions,
the
death
is
a
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court.
we
--
on
one
point
i
essentially
do
not
disagree
with
mrs.
beasley.
i
think
juries
are
in
many
ways
the
conscience
of
the
community
although
i
think
other
organs
of
government,
prosecutors
and
judges
are
as
well
and
our
whole
case
rests
on
what
juries
and
prosecutors
and
the
other
agencies
of
government
have
done.
what
they
have
done
is
to
refuse
to
impose
the
death
penalty.
the
question
then
arises,
well,
why
do
we
not
leave
them
that
way.
if
they
are
refusing
then
why
should
court
step
in.
why
should
not
it
just
die
of
its
own
way?
the
answer
to
that
is
the
case
like
furman
versus
georgia.
where
what
you
have
is
a
regular
garden
variety,
burglary,
murder.
unintended
killing,
somebody
shot
through
the
door,
a
case
submitted
on
the
theory
that
it
was
an
unintended
killing,
there
are
thousands
of
these.
the
jury
comes
back
with
death,
the
defendant
is
black,
the
victim
is
white,
it
is
all
the
aggravation
in
the
case.
the
state
which
distinguishes
between
torture
and
the
mere
extinguishment
of
human
life
cannot
see
that
this
case
is
different
from
the
aggravated
cases.
but
the
jury
is
allowed
in
every
case
to
return
a
death
penalty.
there
are
georgia
figures
in
this
record.
i
do
not
think
they
are
judicially
noticeable
but
they
are
in
this
record,
33
people
on
death
row,
27
of
them
of
black,
six
whites.
the
reasons
why
a
juries
cannot
be
permitted
go
on
doing
what
they
have
done
and
slowly,
inexorably
do
away
with
the
death
penalty
themselves,
is
that
an
individual
in
particular
cases
there
is
going
to
be
a
regression
and
depending
largely
on
the
color
of
the
defendant
and
in
the
ugliness
of
his
person
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
and
it
is
that
kind
of
selectiveness
which
we
think
that
the
death
penalty
forbids.
now,
i
believe
the
lower
court
cases
somewhat
differently
than
mrs.
beasley
does,
i
would
say
that
the
real
development
in
the
eighth
amendment
area
throughout
this
century
has
been
very
pointedly
development
in
the
prison
cases
which
has
the
court
just
recognized
in
haines
and
kerner.
what
has
happened
there
is
that
the
eighth
amendment
has
been
taken
and
given
a
whole
new
meaning
to
respond
to
a
new
problem
and
new
conditions.
what
we
have
in
the
capital
punish
plenary
is
the
exactly
the
same
thing.
and
our
point,
i
repeat
again
with
regard
to
race
is
not
or
poverty
is
not
discrimination,
we
have
not
proved
it.
on
these
records,
it
could
not
be.
what
i
am
saying
is
to
exactly
what
is
happening
in
capital
punishments,
the
rare
arbitrary,
usually
discriminatory
but
unprovably
discriminatory
infliction
of
a
punishment,
escapes
all
other
kinds
of
constitutional
control,
due
process,
equal
protection
and
escapes
the
public
pressure
that
keep
legislatures
acting
decently
unless
there
is
something
in
the
constitution
that
degrades.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
no.
we
do
not
but
i
think
the
basis
of
it
can
be
fairly
simply
stated.
the
court
--
the
concept
to
judicial
notice
is
essentially
that
when
a
writing
is
put
to
there
in
the
public
domain
which
people
may
rebut,
which
people
may
study
and
answer
that
if
a
crime
is
judicially
noticeable
because
its
availability
for
professional
criticisms
makes
it
reliable.
now,
when
a
state
takes
figures
out
of
the
state
department
of
correction
records,
that
has
never
been
printed
anywhere
which
was
(inaudible)
is
un-ascertainable,
whose
significance
is
not
subject
to
criticisms,
that
is
not
judicially
noticeable.
but
when
you
have
--
