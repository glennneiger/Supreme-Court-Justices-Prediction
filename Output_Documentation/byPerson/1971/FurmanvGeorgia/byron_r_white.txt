what
if
it
was
shown
that
only
one
in
a
hundred
rapists
were
put
to
death,
out
of
a
hundred
cases,
approximately,
you
are
getting
constitutional
claim
at
that
time,
does
that
make
any
difference
to
your
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
you
say,
it
should
be
(inaudible)
that
it
becomes
increasingly
selective.
in
my
example
i
would
not
be
any
suit
activity
there
it
just,
you
might
have
arguably
say
the
state
is
executing
only
enough
people
to
make
the
death
penalty
a
credible
threat.
you
say
that
would
not
present
any
question
to
you
under
the
cruel
and
unusual
clause?
justice
byron
r.
white
better
for
you
if
i
doubt
at
the
end
do
you
hear
arguments
on
this
phase
it
would
be
then
that
no
matter
how
rare
the
imposition
is
that
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
provision
is
not
implicated?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
tended
to
figure
for
the
years,
since
1962
and
say
that
the
imposition
of
death
penalty
is
so
rare
that
the
community
has
revolted
by
it
and
it
must
be
considered
to
have
rejected
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
that
is
just
to
give
you,
let
us
assume
the
figure
are
out
that
we
can
rely
on.
what
would
you
say
to
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
i
gather
then
that
rarity
then
just
is
not
enough
to
invoke
the
eighth
amendment
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
professor,
you
indicate
that
it
would
be
quite
proper
under
view
of
the
eighth
amendment
at
least
you
say
you
except
in
prior
cases
suggesting
the
proportionality
principle.
so,
i
take
it
that
it
is
a
legitimate
question
presented
to
this
court
as
to
whether
for
example,
rape
where
there
has
been
no
bugling
harm
or
rape
as
justified
as
it
calls
for
the
death
penalty.
justice

very
straightforward

justice
byron

this
is
what
this
case
is
all

and
what
your
argument
about
rape
as
it

from

is
it

it
has

or
would
you
say
that
it

the
central

basic
argument.
