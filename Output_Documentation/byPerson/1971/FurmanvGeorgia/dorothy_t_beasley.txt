ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
in
this
case
is
and
particularly
in
the
case
now
before
the
court
that
is
furman
versus
georgia
involves
the
fourteenth
amendment
first.
i
think
that
petitioner
has
in
all
of
these
arguments
and
all
of
these
cases
given
way
to
the
proposition
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
hasn't
anything
to
do
with
these
cases
and
the
argument
is
made
simply
that
in
this
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
to
deprive
a
man
of
his
life,
due
process
of
law
is
not
really
looked
that
at
all.
however,
as
it
affects
the
state
that
is
exactly
is
the
most
important
point.
the
fourteenth
amendment
provides
that
life,
liberty
that
no
state
may
deprive
any
person
of
life,
liberty
or
property
without
due
process
of
law.
now,
that
was
written
in
1968
long
after
the
fifth
--
the
eighth
and
the
fifth
amendment
were
written.
so
that
when
the
restrictions
was
made
on
the
state
by
way
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
death
penalty
was
already
recognized
and
the
restriction
on
the
state
was
only
that
they
not
deprive
a
man
of
his
life
or
liberty
or
property
without
due
process
of
law.
and
i
would
submit
that
if
the
court
in
these
instances
rules
that
the
death
penalty
a
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
and
may
not
be
enforced
by
the
state
then
it
would
take
a
constitutional
amendment
because
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
well
as
the
fifth
could
be
rewritten
so
that
we
would
have
a
proposition
that
no
state
may
deprive
any
person
of
life
nor
may
any
state
deprive
any
person
of
liberty
or
property
without
due
process
of
law.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
think
not
your
honor
because
the
terms
of
due
process
of
law
and
this
taking
of
life
or
property
does
not
include
corporal
punishment
of
that
type.
the
state
may
not
deprive
him
of
life,
liberty
or
property
without
due
process
of
law,
but
what
we
had
at
the
beginning
where
a
country
--
was
the
understanding
that
it
may
not
impose
torture
and
that
of
course
would
be
torturous
as
would
a
horse
with
an
essence
that
justice
stewart
mentioned.
so
if
things
were
taken
out
of
the
realm
of
punishment
at
the
very
beginning,
with
the
constitution
being
enacted
and
the
bill
of
rights
so
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
think
whether
it
is
the
claims
that
has
been
used
by
this
court
in
so
many
cases
in
applying
the
due
process
clause.
is
it
a
matter
of
fundamental
standard,
is
it
a
concept
of
our
ordered
liberty,
that
is
where
full
--
that
is
where
a
punishment
period
comes
in,
i
think
and
whether
it
is
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
comes
in
to
the
concept
of
ordered
liberty,
a
fundamental
fairness
and
i
think
that
so
long
as
the
state
utilizes
fundamental
fairness
in
dealing
with
it,
you
know,
fifth
amendment
posing
penalties
that
those
penalties
may
be
used,
particularly
since
the
states
were
specifically
permitted
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
utilize
the
taking
of
life
so
long
as
it
was
done
with
due
process
of
law
and
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
basic
frailties
in
most
of
the
arguments
that
are
made
by
petitioner
because
he
talks
about
rarity
and
discrimination.
well,
obviously
then
it
is
not
with
due
process
of
law,
is
it
all
the
jury
and
that
is
the
limitation
of
the
state.
it
is
not
to
say
as
to
the
penalty.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes
sir.
i
am
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
but
that
was
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
insofar
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no
sir,
i
am
not
saying
that
at
all.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
it
comes
into
the
restrictions
on
the
state
by
way
of
the
due
process
clause,
not
that
in
and
of
itself
and
apart
for
many
consideration
of
due
process
is
applicable
to
the
state.
that
is
very
clear
because
without
the
fourteenth
amendment
the
eighth
amendment
would
not
be
applicable
to
the
states
at
all
because
that
is
not
how
it
was
written.
so
that
in
the
concept
of
due
process
is
where
the
considerations
of
how
we
deal
with
punishment
come
in
and
i
would
submit
that
a
state
may
impose
a
punishment
so
long
as
it
is
not
out
side
of
what
we
regard
in
our
concept
of
ordered
liberty
and
fundamental
fairness
and
i
think
that
is
exactly
where
the
standards
come
in.
the
standards
are
not
so
close
aligned
that
you
can
measure
them
by
polls
taken
today
or
by
the
number
of
people
executed
within
the
last
ten
years.
that
is
--
assume
a
--
close
to
the
line
as
far
as
that
concept
of
ordered
liberty
are
concerned.
moreover,
i
think
that
the
standards
that
ought
to
be
viewed
are
the
ones
that
because
the
courts
have
used
throughout
the
country
in
recognizing
what
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
means
and
the
cases
that
come
out
of
the
state
courts
now,
the
lower
federal
court
and
of
this
court
indicate
that
it
means
barbarous
or
uncivilized
or
torturous
and
that
type
of
thing
and
certainly
the
penalty
of
death
per
se
does
not
come
within
that
prohibition
or
that
understanding.
mr.
justice
marshall,
you
asked
about
whether
the
meaning
of
unusual
has
changed,
i
would
submit
that
it
has
not.
the
meaning
of
unusual
has
not
changed
from
the
time
that
the
eighth
amendment
was
written,
but
the
application
of
it
perhaps
has
and
i
think,
as
i
have
said
before
that
the
death
penalty
itself
be
outside
of
a
consideration
of
that
measure
because
it
specifically
reserves
the
state
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
however,
if
we
are
going
to
measure
whether
in
our
contemporary
deciding,
the
death
penalty
is
to
be
regarded
as
cruel
an
unusual
punishment,
i
think
petitioners
are
using
the
wrong
guideline.
i
think
there
are
three
basic
ones
that
are
compelling
with
respect
to
what
is
the
current
sentence
of
this
specific
regard
to
punishment
and
he
talked
about
the
world
community,
but
we
do
not
know
why
these
countries
did
waive
the
death
penalty.
we
do
not
know
for
example
whether
it
was
the
legislature
or
the
petitioner,
but
even
more
we
do
not
whether
it
was
because
they
have
regarded
it
as
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
or
for
some
other
authority
nor
what
the
crime
is
what?
nor
what
the
punishment
where
the
crime
has
been
displaced
with.
for
example
if
it
--
it
is
quite
that
life
imprisonment,
if
the
death
penalty
so
much
more
severe
that
in
and
of
itself,
is
grossly
disproportionate
as
a
matter
of
degree.
let
me
go
back
to
the
--
i
have
mentioned
that
there
were
three
areas,
i
thought,
should
control
insofar
as
measuring
standards
of
decency,
jury--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
think
it
comes
primarily
from
the
trop
versus
dulles,
that
being
the
last
pronouncement
in
this
area.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no,
there
was
not.
that
is
correct
but
i
think
a
standard
of
course
would
have
to
come
into
play,
i
do
not
think
it
is
that
far
removed
from
fundamental
standards
which
to
me
is
the
basic
standard
that
is
to
be
used
in
this
cases.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
think
that
would
be
the
discriminatory.
that
is
not
looking
at
the
crime.
that
is
looking
at
the
circumstances
of
the
criminal.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
oh!
yes,
indeed.
it
should
be
applied
a
non-discriminatory
manner.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
mr.
justice
douglas
we
submitted
in
our
brief,
a
chart
that
i
obviously
made
up
from
the
statistics
the
we
were
able
to
gather
from
the
department
of
corrections,
showing
those
people
now
under
death
penalty
in
georgia.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
and
i
do
not
think
that
you
could
say
that
there
is
anyone
class
for
that
class
has
been
discriminated
against.
moreover,
even
if
it
were
shown
to
be
discrimination
and
we
submit
that
it
was
not
shown
to
discrimination
that
that
would
not
invalidate
the
death
penalty
per
se
but
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
not
the
eighth
amendment.
in
other
words,
you
may
have
discrimination
in
the
sentencing
and
largely
that
only
black
people
get
the
maximum
for
larceny.
well,
obviously
that
would
be
discriminatory,
but
that
would
not
mean
that
you
could
not
sentence
anybody
to
20
years
imprisonment
for
larceny.
it
would
simply
mean
that
in
no
occasion
where
there
was
discriminations
those
sentences
were
invalid.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes
indeed
and
i
think
their
proof
falls
far
short
of
making
out
the
kind
of
a
prima
facie
case
that
this
court
has
considered
in
cases
like
(inaudible)
with
regard
to
discrimination
by
virtue
of
rape.
and
--
but
even
if
--
i
say,
even
if
they
could
make
it
out,
it
would
not
invalidate
the
death
penalty
because
the
same
thing
would
apply
to
any
other
punishment
when
it
does
not
make
the
death
penalty
anymore
cruel
and
unusual
than
life
imprisonment
or
20
years
in
jail
or
even
1
day
in
jail
is
to
provide
that
in
a
discriminatory
manner
and
of
course
that
then
goes
back
to
the
due
process
clause.
obviously
it
has
to
be
like
that,
it
has
to
be
in
proceedings
which
of
course
in
fact
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
think
not
because
i
do
not
think
it
has
had
the
opportunity
to
do
so.
mr.
amsterdam
suggested
that
it
has
not
had
the
opportunity,
he
has
not
had
the
opportunity
to
present
statistics
to
our
courts,
but
that
certainly
is
not
true
in
the
instant
case.
there
was
no
effort
made
to
bring
any
statistics
or
make
any
argument
as
a
matter
of
fact.
in
furman
the
argument
was
not
even
made
in
the
lower
court.
it
simply
was
stated,
but
no
argument
was
made
and
there
was
a
very,
very
short
argument
to
point
out
in
our
brief,
in
the
brief
to
the
supreme
court
of
georgia,
citing
merely
the
whole
statistics
of
how
many
white
people
and
how
many
black
people
had
been
executed
since
1930
up
to
1968.
but
that
does
not
prove
that
the
death
penalty
is
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
moreover,
those
statistics
which
talks
about
the
period
of
time
since
the
1930
to
1968
in
georgia
case
or
the
old,
since
it's
the
only
state
failed
to
take
account
of
the
exact
changes
in
criminal
justice
that
had
taken
place
under
decisions
of
this
court
as
well
as
the
decisions
of
state
court
so
that
we
are
safeguarding
not
only
criminal
generally,
but
people
who
are
subject
to
the
death
penalty
with
greater
due
process
so
that
when
do
arrive
at
a
consideration
that
they
are
ready
to
be
executed
we
are
sure
that
they
are
--
it
was
arrived
at
in
manner
of
comporting
with
due
process.
and
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
great
fallacy
in
utilizing
the
statistics
with
regard
to
the
number
of
executions
that
they
had
then.
how
many
of
them
have
not
been
executed
because
of
jury
discrimination
where
group
of
jurors
or
illegals
confessions
or
illegal
search
and
seizure
or
something
else
and
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
penalty
that
was
imposed
by
the
jury.
but
again
let
me
just
return
to
--
for
a
moment
to
what
i
regard
as
measurements
of
what
the
standard
should
be.
the
standards
of
fundamental
fairness
and
standards
of
an
ordered
society.
as
i
have
said
i
think
that
should
be
the
jury
is
the
one,
the
juries
across
the
country
are
still
imposing
the
death
penalty
and
certainly
they
are
representatives
of
the
community
as
stated
in
williams
versus
new
york
by
mr.
justice
murphy
in
his
dissent,
in
our
criminal
court
the
jury
is
the
representative
of
the
community,
its
voice
is
that
of
the
society
against
which
the
crime
was
committed.
its
verdict
is
a
community
expression.
witherspoon
also
refers
to
the
jury
representative
of
the
community
and
so
does
trop
versus
dulles
and
i
think
that
it
cannot
be
overlooked
that
the
jury
are
still
imposing
death
penalty
and
did
in
the
650
or
how
many
other
cases
resulted
in
persons
now
under
the
death
penalty
offenses.
they
express
the
community
feelings
and
standards
and
that
was
recognized
in
trop.
they
speak
for
the
community
if
we
are
going
to
look
at
what
the
standards
are
here.
in
this
two
cases
where
georgia
has
standings
for
the
court,
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
internment
in
the
instant
case
right
now
before
the
court,
there
was
only
one
person
of
the
total
panel
of
48
which
means
one
out
of
49
because
one
has
to
be
added
who
will
--
said
that
they
were
so
against
the
death
penalty
that
they
could
never
encourage
it
in
any
case
and
that
it
would
affect
their
determination
of
guilt.
one
out
of
49,
so
that
cannot
show
that
there
is
an
overwhelm
--
these
people
are
selected
at
random
and
moreover,
their
feet
are
put
to
the
fire.
there
was
some
questions
in
one
of
the
earlier
arguments
about,
well,
juries
are
perhaps
just
imposing
the
penalty
now
because
they
know
it
is
not
going
to
be
imposed.
i
would
submit
that
if
it
is
supposed
to
be,
the
overwhelming
repudiation
of
the
death
penalty
that
petitioners
talk
about,
then
why
would
jurors
take
the
unpopular
stand
in
imposing
a
penalty
which
the
world
has
repudiated.
and
secondly,
how
can
we
presume
that
a
juror
sitting
in
the
place
of
judgment
is
going
to
take
a
chance
on
a
penalty
not
being
imposed
when
he
knows
that
his
expressing
as
well
as
the
community.
i
would
submit
that
no
one
with
a
conscience
would
do
so
and
in
certain
point
his
arguing
presumption
of
that
sort.
secondly,
we
speak
also
of
the
second
measurements
then
of
what
--
who
measures
the
standards
and
i
would
say,
the
judiciary.
and
it
is
particularly
appropriate
to
look
there
because
the
jury
--
the
judiciary
is
measuring
the
death
penalty
in
terms
of
whether
it
is
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
not
whether
it
is
why
or
not
whether
as
restriction
or
not
whether
it
can
be
without
it
but
is
it
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
and
reading
all
those
recent
cases
from
around
the
country
i
find
almost
none,
i
find
none,
there
are
probably
are
some
but
none
where
the
court
had
declared
that
it
is
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
and
talking
of
the
state
high
court
and
the
lower
federal
court
where
--
so
that
we
have
the
judiciary
taking
this
very
question
of
whether
it
is
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
and
giving
it
consideration
and
saying
in
our
opinion
and
applying
the
constitution,
we
consider
that
it
is
not.
so
certainly
they
too
express
the
standard
of
decency.
we
have
talked
in
others
situations
of
this
conscience
of
the
court
that
is
for
example
the
test
that
used
in
the
(inaudible)
raised
in
the
fifth
circuit.
does
it
check
the
conscience
of
a
court?
that
is
what
we
are
talking
about
with
regard
to
standards.
it
is
not
something
so
close
to
the
line
that
can
be
measured
as
51%
today
and
49%
tomorrow
and
that
certainly
is
not
the
way
in
which
our
constitution
used
to
be
utilized
or
to
be
construed.
again,
it
is
the
question
we
think
for
the
legislature
to
determine
certainly
in
witherspoon,
the
court
noted
that
the
power
of
a
state
to
execute
a
sentence
--
sentenced
to
death
by
a
jury
does
not
be
--
has
no
bearing
in
what
the
court
does
with
respect
to
whether
the
state
can
select
who
the
person
so
long
as
it
is
done
with
due
process.
and
also
we
would
like
to
point
out
that
there
is
in
many
of
the
cases
before
this
court,
allied
stores
of
ohio
versus
bowers
to
light
this
constitution
which
were
in
1866
and
cases
since
then
a
presumption
of
regularity
and
a
presumption
of
constitutionality
of
legislative
enactment
and
that
has
been
overlooked
i
think
that
petitioners’
argument
and
position.
he
has
the
burden
to
show
that
the
legislative
enactment
is
unconstitutional
and
i
think
that
he
has
done
so,
not
with
respect
to
the
death
penalty
per
se
in
the
abstract
which
is
what
he
contend
should
be
declared
unconstitutional.
thank
you.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
court
has
said
in
stein
versus
new
york
in
1947
that
it
would
not
apply
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
standardize
the
administration
of
justice
has
stagnate
local
variations
and
practice.
and
in
1959
in
williams
versus
oklahoma,
it
was
said
neither
the
due
process
clause
or
the
fourteenth
amendment
nor
anything
else
in
the
federal
constitution
requires
the
state
to
physically
impose
any
particular
penalty
for
any
crime
it
may
define
or
to
impose
the
same
or
“proportionate
sentences”
for
separate
and
independent
crime.
that
was
in
1959.
if
the
death
penalty
for
the
crime
of
rape
is
cruel
and
unusual
then
i
would
submit
that
it
is
an
imposition
upon
the
legislative
enactment
which
has
been
enacted
and
has
been
the
law
in
georgia
since
--
before
in
1851.
rape
has
consistently
taken
the
death
penalty
in
georgia
and
just
in
1960,
the
legislature
again
considered
the
penalty
for
rape.
i
think
it
is
significant
to
note
that
when
it
did
consider
the
penalty
in
1960,
it
was
not
whether
it
should
or
should
not
do
away
with
the
death
penalty
for
a
rape
but
rather
should
it
leave
it
to
the
discretion
of
the
jury
to
make
it
in
or
current
sentencing
of
one
year
to
life
or
should
it
be
rather
one
to
twenty
years
or
a
life
and
the
latter
was
what
went
out.
but
there
was
no
question
either
in
1960
as
to
whether
the
maximum
penalty
should
be
the
death
penalty
or
not.
that
is
the
will
of
the
people
of
georgia
and
there
has
been
nothing
shown
in
this
case
which
would
indicate
that
that
will
should
be
overborne
by
a
construction
of
the
united
states
constitution.
the
main
argument
that
is
made
is
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
rape
statute
in
georgia
shows
that
it
must
be
based
on
racial
considerations
and
i
would
submit
that
what
mr.
justice
blackmun
said
in
stevens
when
he
was
the
circuit
judge
quoting
“brown
versus
allen,”
a
1953
case
is
applicable
here.
the
quotation
was
former
errors
cannot
invalidate
through
retrial
and
i
think
that
is
very
legitimate
here
because
most
of
the
statistics
that
are
taken
by
the
petitioners
brief
allegedly
show
that
the
only
factor
which
goes
to
indicate
the
death
penalty
for
rape
in
georgia
cases
must
be
rape.
i
think
that
those
factors
or
those
statistics
are
used
from
a
period
of
time
in
1930’s,
in
1920’s
and
1940’s,
1950’s
when
perhaps
there
was
racial
discrimination.
we
do
not
know.
but
the
cases
are
now
looked
at
as
to
what
their
circumstances
are.
or
how
heinous
they
are
in
comparison
to
other
rape
or
the
proportion
of
persons,
white
or
black
who
commit
rape
and
what
in
factual
circumstances
of
the
cases
are.
and
i
think
that
they
cannot
make
the
presumption
which
they
indicate
here
that
the
jury
are
looking
at
rape
cases
in
determining
that
a
man
should
suffer
the
death
penalty
in
the
last
analysis
because
only
of
his
race.
and
that
is
the
presumption
which
the
petitioner
asked
this
court
to
make,
i
think
there
is
valid
basis
for
that
whatsoever.
moreover,
they
do
not
apply
it
to
the
circumstances
in
this
case.
their
argument
is
based
on
generality
that
well,
there
are
so
many
negro
men
who
have
been
executed
for
rape
in
georgia
and
there
are
so
many
negro
men
now
on
death
row
in
georgia
for
rape
that
it
must
be
because
they
are
black.
i
think
that
they
have
put
--
offered
no
support
whatsoever
to
forward
that
contention.
moreover,
i
point
out
that
among
those
who
are
now
on
death
row
or
really
not
even
on
death
row,
they
are
kept
on
a
different
floor.
we
do
not
have
a
death
row
for
prisoners
until
they
have
a
date
set.
there
are
two
white
men
that
are
now
under
death
penalty
for
the
crime
of
rape
in
georgia
and
i
would
question
the
particulars
whether
the
penalty
should
be
imposed
upon
them
because
after
all
their
rape
could
not
possibly
have
been
involved.
so,
is
it
not
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
to
them
too?
it
could
not
be
if
the
consideration
is
only
one
of
rape.
moreover,
if
it
is
a
racial
consideration,
the
contention
is
again
a
lack
of
equal
protection
perhaps,
the
discrimination
that
has
the
reading.
but
that
is
not
shown,
it
is
not
proved,
they
do
not
meet
the
quality
of
proof
that
requires
to
make
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination.
secondly,
it
would
be
instead
an
indictment
against
the
jury
system.
it
would
be
a
presumption
that
the
jurors
are
using
a
prejudice
against
rape
to
indicate
what
would
be
an
appropriate
penalty.
that
again
does
not
fit
to
the
death
penalty
per
se
but
rather
attacks
the
jury
system
and
i
think
there
is
no
basis
whatsoever
dealing
in
this
case
or
in
this
brief
by
the
petitioner
to
show
that
that
would
be
so.
i
would
like
to
point
out
also
that
he
makes
no
claim
of
discrimination
in
this
case.
there
certainly
would
be
many
opportunities
to
show
it.
we
have
the
voir
dire
in
which
any
indications
of
prejudice
could
have
been
shown.
it
was
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
and
that
would
have
been
an
absolutely
perfect
place
to
show
that
a
penalty
was
excessive
under
the
circumstances
of
the
case.
the
usual
practice,
to
file
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
to
indicate
that
the
penalty
or
the
verdict
was
unjust
or
that
it
lacked
equity
so
that
the
court
would
have
an
opportunity
to
look
at
the
penalty
and
see
where
in
circumstances
of
the
case
which
was
before
it.
it
was
a
very
lively
before
it
not
on
an
appellate
record.
the
court
itself
could
measure
whether
the
penalty
was
excessive
in
that
particular
case.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes
sir
and
it
is
a
usual
practice.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes.
under
that
we
call
as
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that
would
be
under
what
we
call
the
general
grounds
for
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
which
should
be
that
either
the
verdict
was
not
supported
by
the
evidence
or
the
verdict
was
contrary
to
the
evidence
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
but,
well
the
verdict
of
course
should
be,
both
the
finding
of
guilt
and
the
sentence
and
that
it
was
unjust
or
without
equity.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
he
would
have
to
grant
a
new
trial
in
that
circumstance
and
also
a
question
would
go
upon
in
appeal
in
a
such
a
situation,
the
same.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that
is
right.
in
this
--
that
is
correct.
that
is
the
province
of
the
jury
and
of
course,
the
statute
was
written
at
the
penalty
for
rape
would
be
death
unless
it
was
recommended
by
the
jury
that
it
would
be
like
or
that
it
would
be
one
to
twenty.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
or
life,
it
would
be
the
second
alternative.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that
is
right.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that
is
right
but
it
starts
off
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no,
that
was
the
question
that
arose
in
the
legislature
in
1960.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
right.
moreover,
that
not
only
was
the
question
raised
in
1960
but
we
had
a
complete
criminal
code
revision
in
1968,
so
that
the
question
of
penalties
and
the
appropriateness
of
penalties
will
be
then
taken
up
by
a
special
criminal
code
commission
which
was
reported
to
the
legislature
and
of
course
penalty
for
each
of
the
crime
was
considered
by
that
commission,
so
that
there
was
a
reflection
certainly
of
the
will
of
the
people
in
that
instance.
i
think
that
you
would
have
to
also
presume
if
you
agree
with
the
presumption
that
race
is
included
that
the
juries
have
some
kind
of
conspiracy.
again,
negro
races
for
it
to
be
consistent
for
that
reason
only
but
i
think
petitioner
show
no
dissimilarity
between
those
cases
which
was
the
only
factor
being
raised,
show
that
it
was
that
factor
which
made
him
to
go
to
the
penalty
and
again
i
would
say
that
that
would
not
go
to
the
invalidation
of
the
penalty
but
as
per
se
but
rather
to
the
invalidation
of
the
county
in
a
particular
case
and
that
there
is
no
evidence
whatsoever
in
this
case
which
was
1958,
when
witherspoon
was
applied
and
certainly
they
would
offend
enough
to
show
any
jury
discrimination
in
the
state.
petitioner
says
and
by
the
way
one
of
the
white
men
on
the
death
penalty
in
georgia
proposed,
made
a
proposition
that
the
penalty
of
death
was
discriminatorily
imposed
upon
him
because
he
was
a
white
man
and
only
three
out
of
66
white
men
had
been
executed
for
rape.
so
that
--
it
just
goes
the
other
way
too,
it
just
depends
upon
you
want
to
look
at
it
and
pre-sentence,
the
question
was
upheld.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that
is
right.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
think
his
argument
with
regards
to
it
being
unusual
is
that,
it
is
unusual
because
most
of
the
nations
of
the
world
or
most
of
the
states
in
the
country
do
not
impose
it
for
race
but
i
think
that
it
has
to
take
into
consideration
what
do
they
impose?
if
they
imposed
life
imprisonment,
that
in
itself
is
a
very
severe
penalty
and
it
is
a
distinction
between
life
imprisonment
and
death
so
great
that
the
death
penalty
prosecutes
a
grossly
disproportionate
penalty
for
the
crime
of
rape,
is
rape
--
you
have
to
look
at
the
nature
of
the
crime
and
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
great
fallacies
in
the
argument
that
had
been
presented
by
the
petitions
in
this
case.
they
look
only
at
the
criminal,
they
do
not
look
at
the
totality,
at
society
too
and
i
think
that
mr.
justice
cardozo
in
florida
versus
massachusetts
pointed
this
out,
very
clearly
he
said
but
justice
so
to
the
accused
is
due
to
the
accuser
also.
the
concept
of
fairness
was
not
restrained.
it
is
narrowed
to
a
(inaudible).
we
ought
to
keep
the
balance
and
i
think
that
that
exactly
is
the
answer
to
the
question
of
whether
it
is
excessive
in
these
cases.
that
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
do
not
know
mr.
justice
marshall.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that
is
true.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
am
sure
there
are
others
but
i
do
not
know
how
many
there
are
and
those
that
have
--
there
has
been
other
states
that
had
the
death
penalty
for
rape,
that
have
changed
it
so
that
they
did
not
regret
through
anything,
a
great
deal
of
lesson
i
believe.
and
i
do
not
think
that
petitioners
lay
out
a
case
and
that
is
grossly
disproportionate
with
the
county
particularly
to
the
crime,
particularly
when
we
take
into
consideration
and
i
think
you
must
take
into
consideration
the
severity
of
the
crime.
nobody
has
made
a
point
that
armed
robbery
should
not
be
a
capital
crime
but
there
the
thing
is
overweight.
it
is
done
but
whereas
a
rape
is
lot
--
it
leaves
a
lasting
impression
on
a
woman
and
it
certainly
is
a
very
severe
and
very
(inaudible)
crime.
it
is
one
that
does
not
arrive,
if
someone
lost
property
but
it
is
invasion
of
something
very,
very
personal
and
it
is
a
completely
over
forbearing
of
another
person’s
will
and
an
invasion
of
someone’s
body
and
i
think
that
when
you
look
at
the
nature
of
the
crime
itself,
i
think
that
you
could
not
say
that
it
is
grossly
disproportionate
to
provide
that
kind
of
a
penalty
where
that
thing
is
a
crime.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
not
at
all,
i
think
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
if
he
is
just
shot,
that
is
threat.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that
is
right
but
that
that
fact
does
not
make
any
less
severe
to
the
crime
of
rape
and
that
the
is
the
question
if
the
only
one
that
we
are
measuring
now
as
to
whether
the
penalty
in
this
case
was
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
if
there
was
a
lots
of
equal
protection
then
of
course
that
would
have
to
be
shown
and
if
there
was
lack
of
equal
protection
that
goes
to
that
argument
and
does
not
anything
to
do
with
the
abstract
penalty
itself.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
mr.
justice,
well
i
do
not
know
what
the
percentage
would
be.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
if
that
were
true
then
i
think
we
would
have
to
look
at
the
circumstances
of
the
crime.
rape
is
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that
still
leaves
it
up
to
the
jury
under
our
system.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
think
not.
it
would
depend
on
what
the
other
punishments
were.
i
think
it
were
if
the
other
punishments
that
were
given
were
a
term
of
20
years
then
perhaps
the
death
penalty
would
be
unusual
for
that
one
case.
but
if
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
it
may
very
well
be,
if
there
was
only
one
out
of
a
hundred
and
that
was
consistent
through
our
history.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
because
it
was
so
rare
that
it
never
came
up
except
once.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
but
again
i
would
say
that
that
would
not
make
it
constitutionally
unusual,
cruel
and
unusual
because
again
it
would
be
within
the
legislative
boundaries
that
were
set
for
that
punishment.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
so
long
as
due
process
is
accorded.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes
sir.
then
i
think
it
would
not
be
constitutionally
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
i
think
it
has
a
different
meaning.
it
indicates
pain
rather
than
how
often
a
particular
punishment
is
imposed
that
the
context
in
which
cruel
and
unusual
one,
indicating
lingering
death
for
example
or
torture.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
since
that
is
not
used
at
all,
it
would
be
unusual.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
am
not
sure
whether
it
would
or
not.
the
fourteenth
amendment
says
that
the
state
may
not
because
a
question
of
life,
liberty
or
property
without
due
process
of
law
which
means
to
me
that
it
may
deprive
him
with
due
process
of
law
--
of
life,
or
a
living
or
a
property
and
banishment
would
not
be
included.
as
it
would
not
be
an
acceptable
form
of
punishment
in
the
context
of
our
system
of
justice.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that
type,
it
would
be
a
type
of
punishment
that
is
outside
of
our
reach.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes
indeed.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
am
not
sure
there
is
a
second.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
if
the
state
has
the
power
to
retain
it
then
it
may
be
obtained.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
that
is
correct.
oh!
yes
sir.
indeed,
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
rare
because
they
do
have
a
number
of
persons
like
do
not
at
the
moment
have
the
exact
reform
but
is
in
our
brief.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no.
no
we
do
not
--
i
do
not
have
the
information
but
we
do
have
in
our
brief
the
number
of
those
convictions.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
think
that
was
in
southeastern
basis
or
on
the
national
basis
but
i
have
not
seen
the
figure
on
georgia
itself,
state
by
state.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
do
not
recall
him
doing
so,
if
he
did,
i
would
like
to
know
what
it
is.
but
i
do
not
expect
that
there
has
been
a
recent
figure
and
of
course
that
would
only
be
a
recent
figure
that
would
show
how
unusual
it
would
be
in
terms
of
this
case.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes
indeed.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
think
it
does.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
think
it
would
be
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no,
i
think
indeed
that
is
exactly
what
it
means
because
we
thought
in
both
the
fifth
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
taking
life,
and
taking
property
and
taking
liberty,
which
of
course
imprisonment.
but
we
do
not
talk
about
anything
else.
so
it
implies
the
limitation
of
illustrating
from
the
defense
of
our
system
of
criminal
justice
and
other
things
like
torture
or
banishment
would
be
outside
of
it.
in
most
instances
but
by
the
same
token
the
things
that
are
within
the
deprivations
of
life
or
liberty
or
property
would
not
be
unusual
unless
of
course
it
was
never
used
for
that
particular
crime.
for
example,
if
you
use
the
death
penalty
for
larceny
and
only
one
state
used
it
that
might
be
unusual
because
it
was
not
a
common
law,
well
it
was.
but
that
is
not
a
good
example.
but
i
think
you
see
what
i
mean
the
usefulness
of
the
three
types
of
penalty
was
taken
for
granted
and
was
certainly
even
more
than
that
would
put
right
into
the
constitution.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
life.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
liberty.
right.
and
here
we
are
talking
about
deprivation
of
life
and
then
it
becomes
only
a
matter
of
degree.
the
petitioners
here
say
that
its
excessive
for
rape
although
they
do
go
that
further
and
say
not
only
is
it
excessive
but
the
only
reason
that
they
are
imposing
it
in
itself
is
because
of
rape.
but
i
do
not
think
that
is
the
statistics.
certainly,
the
statistics
don't
show
that.
there
maybe
of
some
indication
that
more
negroes
have
imposed
upon
them
the
death
penalty
but
you
again
would
have
to
look
at
the
facts
of
the
crime
involved
to
see
whether
it
was
excessive
and
he
has
made
no
indication
here,
has
made
no
claim
and
no
allegations
that
it
was
excessive
in
this
case
but
only
if
excessive
in
that
sentence.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
it
is
an
abstract
principle,
that
is
right.
but
it
does
not
go
as
so
far
as
to
say
well
if
it
is
not
excessive
in
all
cases
then
it
is
excessive
in
this
one.
and
i
think
it
would
reach
and
i
tihnk
it
would
show
that
it
was.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
if
that
were
true
i
would
say
that
we
would
again
have
to
look
at
the
circumstances
of
the
crime
that
if
he
could
show,
make
out
what
this
court
in
terms
of
prima
facie
case
of
discriminations
in
sentencing,
then
of
course
it
would
be
on
an
individual
case
basis,
the
penalty
would
be
invalid
and
if
as
a
result,
no
jury
convicted
or
sentenced
to
white
man
or
no
jury
sentenced
to
black
man
again
for
the
crime
of
rape.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that
probably
would
be
a
prima
facie
case.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that
is
not
this
case
and
moreover
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
the
death
penalty
is
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
i
think
in
all
of
this,
i
mentioned
that
just
a
moment
before
that
we
have
to
look
also
at
the
crime
and
not
only
at
the
criminal
and
it
was
said
in
the
recent
case
of
state
versus
(inaudible)
in
new
jersey
in
1971,
i
think
it
was
pertinent.
the
first
right
of
the
individuals
to
be
protected
from
attack,
that
is
where
we
have
government
as
the
preambles
of
the
federal
constitutional
plainly
said,
in
the
words
of
chicago
versus
sturges
a
1911
united
states
supreme
court
case
primarily
governments
exists
for
the
maintenance
of
social
order.
hence
it
is
that
the
obligation
of
the
government
to
protect
life,
liberty
and
property
against
the
conduct
of
the
indifferent,
the
careless
and
the
evil
minded
maybe
regarded
as
long
at
the
very
foundation
of
the
social
compact.
the
bill
of
rights
was
not
intended
to
be
neither
a
primary
mission.
this
is
not
to
belittle
the
inestimable
rights
that
is
consecrated
but
rather
to
say
that
those
rights
may
not
be
related
to
speech.
the
very
reason
of
government
itself.
government
in
these
cases
has
determined
that
rape
and
murder
under
the
circumstances
of
these
cases.
there,
the
death
penalty
as
the
maximum
and
we
maintain
that
they
should
be
retained
as
penalty,
thank
you.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
in
this
case
is
and
particularly
in
the
case
now
before
the
court
that
is
furman
versus
georgia
involves
the
fourteenth
amendment
first.
i
think
that
petitioner
has
in
all
of
these
arguments
and
all
of
these
cases
given
way
to
the
proposition
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
hasn't
anything
to
do
with
these
cases
and
the
argument
is
made
simply
that
in
this
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
to
deprive
a
man
of
his
life,
due
process
of
law
is
not
really
looked
that
at
all.
however,
as
it
affects
the
state
that
is
exactly
is
the
most
important
point.
the
fourteenth
amendment
provides
that
life,
liberty
that
no
state
may
deprive
any
person
of
life,
liberty
or
property
without
due
process
of
law.
now,
that
was
written
in
1968
long
after
the
fifth
--
the
eighth
and
the
fifth
amendment
were
written.
so
that
when
the
restrictions
was
made
on
the
state
by
way
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
death
penalty
was
already
recognized
and
the
restriction
on
the
state
was
only
that
they
not
deprive
a
man
of
his
life
or
liberty
or
property
without
due
process
of
law.
and
i
would
submit
that
if
the
court
in
these
instances
rules
that
the
death
penalty
a
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
and
may
not
be
enforced
by
the
state
then
it
would
take
a
constitutional
amendment
because
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
well
as
the
fifth
could
be
rewritten
so
that
we
would
have
a
proposition
that
no
state
may
deprive
any
person
of
life
nor
may
any
state
deprive
any
person
of
liberty
or
property
without
due
process
of
law.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
think
not
your
honor
because
the
terms
of
due
process
of
law
and
this
taking
of
life
or
property
does
not
include
corporal
punishment
of
that
type.
the
state
may
not
deprive
him
of
life,
liberty
or
property
without
due
process
of
law,
but
what
we
had
at
the
beginning
where
a
country
--
was
the
understanding
that
it
may
not
impose
torture
and
that
of
course
would
be
torturous
as
would
a
horse
with
an
essence
that
justice
stewart
mentioned.
so
if
things
were
taken
out
of
the
realm
of
punishment
at
the
very
beginning,
with
the
constitution
being
enacted
and
the
bill
of
rights
so
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
think
whether
it
is
the
claims
that
has
been
used
by
this
court
in
so
many
cases
in
applying
the
due
process
clause.
is
it
a
matter
of
fundamental
standard,
is
it
a
concept
of
our
ordered
liberty,
that
is
where
full
--
that
is
where
a
punishment
period
comes
in,
i
think
and
whether
it
is
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
comes
in
to
the
concept
of
ordered
liberty,
a
fundamental
fairness
and
i
think
that
so
long
as
the
state
utilizes
fundamental
fairness
in
dealing
with
it,
you
know,
fifth
amendment
posing
penalties
that
those
penalties
may
be
used,
particularly
since
the
states
were
specifically
permitted
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
utilize
the
taking
of
life
so
long
as
it
was
done
with
due
process
of
law
and
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
basic
frailties
in
most
of
the
arguments
that
are
made
by
petitioner
because
he
talks
about
rarity
and
discrimination.
well,
obviously
then
it
is
not
with
due
process
of
law,
is
it
all
the
jury
and
that
is
the
limitation
of
the
state.
it
is
not
to
say
as
to
the
penalty.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes
sir.
i
am
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
but
that
was
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
insofar
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no
sir,
i
am
not
saying
that
at
all.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
it
comes
into
the
restrictions
on
the
state
by
way
of
the
due
process
clause,
not
that
in
and
of
itself
and
apart
for
many
consideration
of
due
process
is
applicable
to
the
state.
that
is
very
clear
because
without
the
fourteenth
amendment
the
eighth
amendment
would
not
be
applicable
to
the
states
at
all
because
that
is
not
how
it
was
written.
so
that
in
the
concept
of
due
process
is
where
the
considerations
of
how
we
deal
with
punishment
come
in
and
i
would
submit
that
a
state
may
impose
a
punishment
so
long
as
it
is
not
out
side
of
what
we
regard
in
our
concept
of
ordered
liberty
and
fundamental
fairness
and
i
think
that
is
exactly
where
the
standards
come
in.
the
standards
are
not
so
close
aligned
that
you
can
measure
them
by
polls
taken
today
or
by
the
number
of
people
executed
within
the
last
ten
years.
that
is
--
assume
a
--
close
to
the
line
as
far
as
that
concept
of
ordered
liberty
are
concerned.
moreover,
i
think
that
the
standards
that
ought
to
be
viewed
are
the
ones
that
because
the
courts
have
used
throughout
the
country
in
recognizing
what
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
means
and
the
cases
that
come
out
of
the
state
courts
now,
the
lower
federal
court
and
of
this
court
indicate
that
it
means
barbarous
or
uncivilized
or
torturous
and
that
type
of
thing
and
certainly
the
penalty
of
death
per
se
does
not
come
within
that
prohibition
or
that
understanding.
mr.
justice
marshall,
you
asked
about
whether
the
meaning
of
unusual
has
changed,
i
would
submit
that
it
has
not.
the
meaning
of
unusual
has
not
changed
from
the
time
that
the
eighth
amendment
was
written,
but
the
application
of
it
perhaps
has
and
i
think,
as
i
have
said
before
that
the
death
penalty
itself
be
outside
of
a
consideration
of
that
measure
because
it
specifically
reserves
the
state
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
however,
if
we
are
going
to
measure
whether
in
our
contemporary
deciding,
the
death
penalty
is
to
be
regarded
as
cruel
an
unusual
punishment,
i
think
petitioners
are
using
the
wrong
guideline.
i
think
there
are
three
basic
ones
that
are
compelling
with
respect
to
what
is
the
current
sentence
of
this
specific
regard
to
punishment
and
he
talked
about
the
world
community,
but
we
do
not
know
why
these
countries
did
waive
the
death
penalty.
we
do
not
know
for
example
whether
it
was
the
legislature
or
the
petitioner,
but
even
more
we
do
not
whether
it
was
because
they
have
regarded
it
as
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
or
for
some
other
authority
nor
what
the
crime
is
what?
nor
what
the
punishment
where
the
crime
has
been
displaced
with.
for
example
if
it
--
it
is
quite
that
life
imprisonment,
if
the
death
penalty
so
much
more
severe
that
in
and
of
itself,
is
grossly
disproportionate
as
a
matter
of
degree.
let
me
go
back
to
the
--
i
have
mentioned
that
there
were
three
areas,
i
thought,
should
control
insofar
as
measuring
standards
of
decency,
jury--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
think
it
comes
primarily
from
the
trop
versus
dulles,
that
being
the
last
pronouncement
in
this
area.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no,
there
was
not.
that
is
correct
but
i
think
a
standard
of
course
would
have
to
come
into
play,
i
do
not
think
it
is
that
far
removed
from
fundamental
standards
which
to
me
is
the
basic
standard
that
is
to
be
used
in
this
cases.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
think
that
would
be
the
discriminatory.
that
is
not
looking
at
the
crime.
that
is
looking
at
the
circumstances
of
the
criminal.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
oh!
yes,
indeed.
it
should
be
applied
a
non-discriminatory
manner.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
mr.
justice
douglas
we
submitted
in
our
brief,
a
chart
that
i
obviously
made
up
from
the
statistics
the
we
were
able
to
gather
from
the
department
of
corrections,
showing
those
people
now
under
death
penalty
in
georgia.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
and
i
do
not
think
that
you
could
say
that
there
is
anyone
class
for
that
class
has
been
discriminated
against.
moreover,
even
if
it
were
shown
to
be
discrimination
and
we
submit
that
it
was
not
shown
to
discrimination
that
that
would
not
invalidate
the
death
penalty
per
se
but
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
not
the
eighth
amendment.
in
other
words,
you
may
have
discrimination
in
the
sentencing
and
largely
that
only
black
people
get
the
maximum
for
larceny.
well,
obviously
that
would
be
discriminatory,
but
that
would
not
mean
that
you
could
not
sentence
anybody
to
20
years
imprisonment
for
larceny.
it
would
simply
mean
that
in
no
occasion
where
there
was
discriminations
those
sentences
were
invalid.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes
indeed
and
i
think
their
proof
falls
far
short
of
making
out
the
kind
of
a
prima
facie
case
that
this
court
has
considered
in
cases
like
(inaudible)
with
regard
to
discrimination
by
virtue
of
rape.
and
--
but
even
if
--
i
say,
even
if
they
could
make
it
out,
it
would
not
invalidate
the
death
penalty
because
the
same
thing
would
apply
to
any
other
punishment
when
it
does
not
make
the
death
penalty
anymore
cruel
and
unusual
than
life
imprisonment
or
20
years
in
jail
or
even
1
day
in
jail
is
to
provide
that
in
a
discriminatory
manner
and
of
course
that
then
goes
back
to
the
due
process
clause.
obviously
it
has
to
be
like
that,
it
has
to
be
in
proceedings
which
of
course
in
fact
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
think
not
because
i
do
not
think
it
has
had
the
opportunity
to
do
so.
mr.
amsterdam
suggested
that
it
has
not
had
the
opportunity,
he
has
not
had
the
opportunity
to
present
statistics
to
our
courts,
but
that
certainly
is
not
true
in
the
instant
case.
there
was
no
effort
made
to
bring
any
statistics
or
make
any
argument
as
a
matter
of
fact.
in
furman
the
argument
was
not
even
made
in
the
lower
court.
it
simply
was
stated,
but
no
argument
was
made
and
there
was
a
very,
very
short
argument
to
point
out
in
our
brief,
in
the
brief
to
the
supreme
court
of
georgia,
citing
merely
the
whole
statistics
of
how
many
white
people
and
how
many
black
people
had
been
executed
since
1930
up
to
1968.
but
that
does
not
prove
that
the
death
penalty
is
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
moreover,
those
statistics
which
talks
about
the
period
of
time
since
the
1930
to
1968
in
georgia
case
or
the
old,
since
it's
the
only
state
failed
to
take
account
of
the
exact
changes
in
criminal
justice
that
had
taken
place
under
decisions
of
this
court
as
well
as
the
decisions
of
state
court
so
that
we
are
safeguarding
not
only
criminal
generally,
but
people
who
are
subject
to
the
death
penalty
with
greater
due
process
so
that
when
do
arrive
at
a
consideration
that
they
are
ready
to
be
executed
we
are
sure
that
they
are
--
it
was
arrived
at
in
manner
of
comporting
with
due
process.
and
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
great
fallacy
in
utilizing
the
statistics
with
regard
to
the
number
of
executions
that
they
had
then.
how
many
of
them
have
not
been
executed
because
of
jury
discrimination
where
group
of
jurors
or
illegals
confessions
or
illegal
search
and
seizure
or
something
else
and
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
penalty
that
was
imposed
by
the
jury.
but
again
let
me
just
return
to
--
for
a
moment
to
what
i
regard
as
measurements
of
what
the
standard
should
be.
the
standards
of
fundamental
fairness
and
standards
of
an
ordered
society.
as
i
have
said
i
think
that
should
be
the
jury
is
the
one,
the
juries
across
the
country
are
still
imposing
the
death
penalty
and
certainly
they
are
representatives
of
the
community
as
stated
in
williams
versus
new
york
by
mr.
justice
murphy
in
his
dissent,
in
our
criminal
court
the
jury
is
the
representative
of
the
community,
its
voice
is
that
of
the
society
against
which
the
crime
was
committed.
its
verdict
is
a
community
expression.
witherspoon
also
refers
to
the
jury
representative
of
the
community
and
so
does
trop
versus
dulles
and
i
think
that
it
cannot
be
overlooked
that
the
jury
are
still
imposing
death
penalty
and
did
in
the
650
or
how
many
other
cases
resulted
in
persons
now
under
the
death
penalty
offenses.
they
express
the
community
feelings
and
standards
and
that
was
recognized
in
trop.
they
speak
for
the
community
if
we
are
going
to
look
at
what
the
standards
are
here.
in
this
two
cases
where
georgia
has
standings
for
the
court,
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
internment
in
the
instant
case
right
now
before
the
court,
there
was
only
one
person
of
the
total
panel
of
48
which
means
one
out
of
49
because
one
has
to
be
added
who
will
--
said
that
they
were
so
against
the
death
penalty
that
they
could
never
encourage
it
in
any
case
and
that
it
would
affect
their
determination
of
guilt.
one
out
of
49,
so
that
cannot
show
that
there
is
an
overwhelm
--
these
people
are
selected
at
random
and
moreover,
their
feet
are
put
to
the
fire.
there
was
some
questions
in
one
of
the
earlier
arguments
about,
well,
juries
are
perhaps
just
imposing
the
penalty
now
because
they
know
it
is
not
going
to
be
imposed.
i
would
submit
that
if
it
is
supposed
to
be,
the
overwhelming
repudiation
of
the
death
penalty
that
petitioners
talk
about,
then
why
would
jurors
take
the
unpopular
stand
in
imposing
a
penalty
which
the
world
has
repudiated.
and
secondly,
how
can
we
presume
that
a
juror
sitting
in
the
place
of
judgment
is
going
to
take
a
chance
on
a
penalty
not
being
imposed
when
he
knows
that
his
expressing
as
well
as
the
community.
i
would
submit
that
no
one
with
a
conscience
would
do
so
and
in
certain
point
his
arguing
presumption
of
that
sort.
secondly,
we
speak
also
of
the
second
measurements
then
of
what
--
who
measures
the
standards
and
i
would
say,
the
judiciary.
and
it
is
particularly
appropriate
to
look
there
because
the
jury
--
the
judiciary
is
measuring
the
death
penalty
in
terms
of
whether
it
is
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
not
whether
it
is
why
or
not
whether
as
restriction
or
not
whether
it
can
be
without
it
but
is
it
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
and
reading
all
those
recent
cases
from
around
the
country
i
find
almost
none,
i
find
none,
there
are
probably
are
some
but
none
where
the
court
had
declared
that
it
is
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
and
talking
of
the
state
high
court
and
the
lower
federal
court
where
--
so
that
we
have
the
judiciary
taking
this
very
question
of
whether
it
is
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
and
giving
it
consideration
and
saying
in
our
opinion
and
applying
the
constitution,
we
consider
that
it
is
not.
so
certainly
they
too
express
the
standard
of
decency.
we
have
talked
in
others
situations
of
this
conscience
of
the
court
that
is
for
example
the
test
that
used
in
the
(inaudible)
raised
in
the
fifth
circuit.
does
it
check
the
conscience
of
a
court?
that
is
what
we
are
talking
about
with
regard
to
standards.
it
is
not
something
so
close
to
the
line
that
can
be
measured
as
51%
today
and
49%
tomorrow
and
that
certainly
is
not
the
way
in
which
our
constitution
used
to
be
utilized
or
to
be
construed.
again,
it
is
the
question
we
think
for
the
legislature
to
determine
certainly
in
witherspoon,
the
court
noted
that
the
power
of
a
state
to
execute
a
sentence
--
sentenced
to
death
by
a
jury
does
not
be
--
has
no
bearing
in
what
the
court
does
with
respect
to
whether
the
state
can
select
who
the
person
so
long
as
it
is
done
with
due
process.
and
also
we
would
like
to
point
out
that
there
is
in
many
of
the
cases
before
this
court,
allied
stores
of
ohio
versus
bowers
to
light
this
constitution
which
were
in
1866
and
cases
since
then
a
presumption
of
regularity
and
a
presumption
of
constitutionality
of
legislative
enactment
and
that
has
been
overlooked
i
think
that
petitioners’
argument
and
position.
he
has
the
burden
to
show
that
the
legislative
enactment
is
unconstitutional
and
i
think
that
he
has
done
so,
not
with
respect
to
the
death
penalty
per
se
in
the
abstract
which
is
what
he
contend
should
be
declared
unconstitutional.
thank
you.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
court
has
said
in
stein
versus
new
york
in
1947
that
it
would
not
apply
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
standardize
the
administration
of
justice
has
stagnate
local
variations
and
practice.
and
in
1959
in
williams
versus
oklahoma,
it
was
said
neither
the
due
process
clause
or
the
fourteenth
amendment
nor
anything
else
in
the
federal
constitution
requires
the
state
to
physically
impose
any
particular
penalty
for
any
crime
it
may
define
or
to
impose
the
same
or
“proportionate
sentences”
for
separate
and
independent
crime.
that
was
in
1959.
if
the
death
penalty
for
the
crime
of
rape
is
cruel
and
unusual
then
i
would
submit
that
it
is
an
imposition
upon
the
legislative
enactment
which
has
been
enacted
and
has
been
the
law
in
georgia
since
--
before
in
1851.
rape
has
consistently
taken
the
death
penalty
in
georgia
and
just
in
1960,
the
legislature
again
considered
the
penalty
for
rape.
i
think
it
is
significant
to
note
that
when
it
did
consider
the
penalty
in
1960,
it
was
not
whether
it
should
or
should
not
do
away
with
the
death
penalty
for
a
rape
but
rather
should
it
leave
it
to
the
discretion
of
the
jury
to
make
it
in
or
current
sentencing
of
one
year
to
life
or
should
it
be
rather
one
to
twenty
years
or
a
life
and
the
latter
was
what
went
out.
but
there
was
no
question
either
in
1960
as
to
whether
the
maximum
penalty
should
be
the
death
penalty
or
not.
that
is
the
will
of
the
people
of
georgia
and
there
has
been
nothing
shown
in
this
case
which
would
indicate
that
that
will
should
be
overborne
by
a
construction
of
the
united
states
constitution.
the
main
argument
that
is
made
is
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
rape
statute
in
georgia
shows
that
it
must
be
based
on
racial
considerations
and
i
would
submit
that
what
mr.
justice
blackmun
said
in
stevens
when
he
was
the
circuit
judge
quoting
“brown
versus
allen,”
a
1953
case
is
applicable
here.
the
quotation
was
former
errors
cannot
invalidate
through
retrial
and
i
think
that
is
very
legitimate
here
because
most
of
the
statistics
that
are
taken
by
the
petitioners
brief
allegedly
show
that
the
only
factor
which
goes
to
indicate
the
death
penalty
for
rape
in
georgia
cases
must
be
rape.
i
think
that
those
factors
or
those
statistics
are
used
from
a
period
of
time
in
1930’s,
in
1920’s
and
1940’s,
1950’s
when
perhaps
there
was
racial
discrimination.
we
do
not
know.
but
the
cases
are
now
looked
at
as
to
what
their
circumstances
are.
or
how
heinous
they
are
in
comparison
to
other
rape
or
the
proportion
of
persons,
white
or
black
who
commit
rape
and
what
in
factual
circumstances
of
the
cases
are.
and
i
think
that
they
cannot
make
the
presumption
which
they
indicate
here
that
the
jury
are
looking
at
rape
cases
in
determining
that
a
man
should
suffer
the
death
penalty
in
the
last
analysis
because
only
of
his
race.
and
that
is
the
presumption
which
the
petitioner
asked
this
court
to
make,
i
think
there
is
valid
basis
for
that
whatsoever.
moreover,
they
do
not
apply
it
to
the
circumstances
in
this
case.
their
argument
is
based
on
generality
that
well,
there
are
so
many
negro
men
who
have
been
executed
for
rape
in
georgia
and
there
are
so
many
negro
men
now
on
death
row
in
georgia
for
rape
that
it
must
be
because
they
are
black.
i
think
that
they
have
put
--
offered
no
support
whatsoever
to
forward
that
contention.
moreover,
i
point
out
that
among
those
who
are
now
on
death
row
or
really
not
even
on
death
row,
they
are
kept
on
a
different
floor.
we
do
not
have
a
death
row
for
prisoners
until
they
have
a
date
set.
there
are
two
white
men
that
are
now
under
death
penalty
for
the
crime
of
rape
in
georgia
and
i
would
question
the
particulars
whether
the
penalty
should
be
imposed
upon
them
because
after
all
their
rape
could
not
possibly
have
been
involved.
so,
is
it
not
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
to
them
too?
it
could
not
be
if
the
consideration
is
only
one
of
rape.
moreover,
if
it
is
a
racial
consideration,
the
contention
is
again
a
lack
of
equal
protection
perhaps,
the
discrimination
that
has
the
reading.
but
that
is
not
shown,
it
is
not
proved,
they
do
not
meet
the
quality
of
proof
that
requires
to
make
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination.
secondly,
it
would
be
instead
an
indictment
against
the
jury
system.
it
would
be
a
presumption
that
the
jurors
are
using
a
prejudice
against
rape
to
indicate
what
would
be
an
appropriate
penalty.
that
again
does
not
fit
to
the
death
penalty
per
se
but
rather
attacks
the
jury
system
and
i
think
there
is
no
basis
whatsoever
dealing
in
this
case
or
in
this
brief
by
the
petitioner
to
show
that
that
would
be
so.
i
would
like
to
point
out
also
that
he
makes
no
claim
of
discrimination
in
this
case.
there
certainly
would
be
many
opportunities
to
show
it.
we
have
the
voir
dire
in
which
any
indications
of
prejudice
could
have
been
shown.
it
was
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
and
that
would
have
been
an
absolutely
perfect
place
to
show
that
a
penalty
was
excessive
under
the
circumstances
of
the
case.
the
usual
practice,
to
file
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
to
indicate
that
the
penalty
or
the
verdict
was
unjust
or
that
it
lacked
equity
so
that
the
court
would
have
an
opportunity
to
look
at
the
penalty
and
see
where
in
circumstances
of
the
case
which
was
before
it.
it
was
a
very
lively
before
it
not
on
an
appellate
record.
the
court
itself
could
measure
whether
the
penalty
was
excessive
in
that
particular
case.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes
sir
and
it
is
a
usual
practice.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes.
under
that
we
call
as
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that
would
be
under
what
we
call
the
general
grounds
for
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
which
should
be
that
either
the
verdict
was
not
supported
by
the
evidence
or
the
verdict
was
contrary
to
the
evidence
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
but,
well
the
verdict
of
course
should
be,
both
the
finding
of
guilt
and
the
sentence
and
that
it
was
unjust
or
without
equity.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
he
would
have
to
grant
a
new
trial
in
that
circumstance
and
also
a
question
would
go
upon
in
appeal
in
a
such
a
situation,
the
same.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that
is
right.
in
this
--
that
is
correct.
that
is
the
province
of
the
jury
and
of
course,
the
statute
was
written
at
the
penalty
for
rape
would
be
death
unless
it
was
recommended
by
the
jury
that
it
would
be
like
or
that
it
would
be
one
to
twenty.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
or
life,
it
would
be
the
second
alternative.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that
is
right.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that
is
right
but
it
starts
off
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no,
that
was
the
question
that
arose
in
the
legislature
in
1960.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
right.
moreover,
that
not
only
was
the
question
raised
in
1960
but
we
had
a
complete
criminal
code
revision
in
1968,
so
that
the
question
of
penalties
and
the
appropriateness
of
penalties
will
be
then
taken
up
by
a
special
criminal
code
commission
which
was
reported
to
the
legislature
and
of
course
penalty
for
each
of
the
crime
was
considered
by
that
commission,
so
that
there
was
a
reflection
certainly
of
the
will
of
the
people
in
that
instance.
i
think
that
you
would
have
to
also
presume
if
you
agree
with
the
presumption
that
race
is
included
that
the
juries
have
some
kind
of
conspiracy.
again,
negro
races
for
it
to
be
consistent
for
that
reason
only
but
i
think
petitioner
show
no
dissimilarity
between
those
cases
which
was
the
only
factor
being
raised,
show
that
it
was
that
factor
which
made
him
to
go
to
the
penalty
and
again
i
would
say
that
that
would
not
go
to
the
invalidation
of
the
penalty
but
as
per
se
but
rather
to
the
invalidation
of
the
county
in
a
particular
case
and
that
there
is
no
evidence
whatsoever
in
this
case
which
was
1958,
when
witherspoon
was
applied
and
certainly
they
would
offend
enough
to
show
any
jury
discrimination
in
the
state.
petitioner
says
and
by
the
way
one
of
the
white
men
on
the
death
penalty
in
georgia
proposed,
made
a
proposition
that
the
penalty
of
death
was
discriminatorily
imposed
upon
him
because
he
was
a
white
man
and
only
three
out
of
66
white
men
had
been
executed
for
rape.
so
that
--
it
just
goes
the
other
way
too,
it
just
depends
upon
you
want
to
look
at
it
and
pre-sentence,
the
question
was
upheld.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that
is
right.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
think
his
argument
with
regards
to
it
being
unusual
is
that,
it
is
unusual
because
most
of
the
nations
of
the
world
or
most
of
the
states
in
the
country
do
not
impose
it
for
race
but
i
think
that
it
has
to
take
into
consideration
what
do
they
impose?
if
they
imposed
life
imprisonment,
that
in
itself
is
a
very
severe
penalty
and
it
is
a
distinction
between
life
imprisonment
and
death
so
great
that
the
death
penalty
prosecutes
a
grossly
disproportionate
penalty
for
the
crime
of
rape,
is
rape
--
you
have
to
look
at
the
nature
of
the
crime
and
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
great
fallacies
in
the
argument
that
had
been
presented
by
the
petitions
in
this
case.
they
look
only
at
the
criminal,
they
do
not
look
at
the
totality,
at
society
too
and
i
think
that
mr.
justice
cardozo
in
florida
versus
massachusetts
pointed
this
out,
very
clearly
he
said
but
justice
so
to
the
accused
is
due
to
the
accuser
also.
the
concept
of
fairness
was
not
restrained.
it
is
narrowed
to
a
(inaudible).
we
ought
to
keep
the
balance
and
i
think
that
that
exactly
is
the
answer
to
the
question
of
whether
it
is
excessive
in
these
cases.
that
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
do
not
know
mr.
justice
marshall.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that
is
true.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
am
sure
there
are
others
but
i
do
not
know
how
many
there
are
and
those
that
have
--
there
has
been
other
states
that
had
the
death
penalty
for
rape,
that
have
changed
it
so
that
they
did
not
regret
through
anything,
a
great
deal
of
lesson
i
believe.
and
i
do
not
think
that
petitioners
lay
out
a
case
and
that
is
grossly
disproportionate
with
the
county
particularly
to
the
crime,
particularly
when
we
take
into
consideration
and
i
think
you
must
take
into
consideration
the
severity
of
the
crime.
nobody
has
made
a
point
that
armed
robbery
should
not
be
a
capital
crime
but
there
the
thing
is
overweight.
it
is
done
but
whereas
a
rape
is
lot
--
it
leaves
a
lasting
impression
on
a
woman
and
it
certainly
is
a
very
severe
and
very
(inaudible)
crime.
it
is
one
that
does
not
arrive,
if
someone
lost
property
but
it
is
invasion
of
something
very,
very
personal
and
it
is
a
completely
over
forbearing
of
another
person’s
will
and
an
invasion
of
someone’s
body
and
i
think
that
when
you
look
at
the
nature
of
the
crime
itself,
i
think
that
you
could
not
say
that
it
is
grossly
disproportionate
to
provide
that
kind
of
a
penalty
where
that
thing
is
a
crime.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
not
at
all,
i
think
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
if
he
is
just
shot,
that
is
threat.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that
is
right
but
that
that
fact
does
not
make
any
less
severe
to
the
crime
of
rape
and
that
the
is
the
question
if
the
only
one
that
we
are
measuring
now
as
to
whether
the
penalty
in
this
case
was
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
if
there
was
a
lots
of
equal
protection
then
of
course
that
would
have
to
be
shown
and
if
there
was
lack
of
equal
protection
that
goes
to
that
argument
and
does
not
anything
to
do
with
the
abstract
penalty
itself.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
mr.
justice,
well
i
do
not
know
what
the
percentage
would
be.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
if
that
were
true
then
i
think
we
would
have
to
look
at
the
circumstances
of
the
crime.
rape
is
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that
still
leaves
it
up
to
the
jury
under
our
system.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
think
not.
it
would
depend
on
what
the
other
punishments
were.
i
think
it
were
if
the
other
punishments
that
were
given
were
a
term
of
20
years
then
perhaps
the
death
penalty
would
be
unusual
for
that
one
case.
but
if
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
it
may
very
well
be,
if
there
was
only
one
out
of
a
hundred
and
that
was
consistent
through
our
history.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
because
it
was
so
rare
that
it
never
came
up
except
once.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
but
again
i
would
say
that
that
would
not
make
it
constitutionally
unusual,
cruel
and
unusual
because
again
it
would
be
within
the
legislative
boundaries
that
were
set
for
that
punishment.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
so
long
as
due
process
is
accorded.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes
sir.
then
i
think
it
would
not
be
constitutionally
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
i
think
it
has
a
different
meaning.
it
indicates
pain
rather
than
how
often
a
particular
punishment
is
imposed
that
the
context
in
which
cruel
and
unusual
one,
indicating
lingering
death
for
example
or
torture.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
since
that
is
not
used
at
all,
it
would
be
unusual.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
am
not
sure
whether
it
would
or
not.
the
fourteenth
amendment
says
that
the
state
may
not
because
a
question
of
life,
liberty
or
property
without
due
process
of
law
which
means
to
me
that
it
may
deprive
him
with
due
process
of
law
--
of
life,
or
a
living
or
a
property
and
banishment
would
not
be
included.
as
it
would
not
be
an
acceptable
form
of
punishment
in
the
context
of
our
system
of
justice.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that
type,
it
would
be
a
type
of
punishment
that
is
outside
of
our
reach.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes
indeed.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
am
not
sure
there
is
a
second.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
if
the
state
has
the
power
to
retain
it
then
it
may
be
obtained.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
that
is
correct.
oh!
yes
sir.
indeed,
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
rare
because
they
do
have
a
number
of
persons
like
do
not
at
the
moment
have
the
exact
reform
but
is
in
our
brief.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no.
no
we
do
not
--
i
do
not
have
the
information
but
we
do
have
in
our
brief
the
number
of
those
convictions.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
think
that
was
in
southeastern
basis
or
on
the
national
basis
but
i
have
not
seen
the
figure
on
georgia
itself,
state
by
state.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
do
not
recall
him
doing
so,
if
he
did,
i
would
like
to
know
what
it
is.
but
i
do
not
expect
that
there
has
been
a
recent
figure
and
of
course
that
would
only
be
a
recent
figure
that
would
show
how
unusual
it
would
be
in
terms
of
this
case.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes
indeed.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
think
it
does.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
think
it
would
be
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no,
i
think
indeed
that
is
exactly
what
it
means
because
we
thought
in
both
the
fifth
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
taking
life,
and
taking
property
and
taking
liberty,
which
of
course
imprisonment.
but
we
do
not
talk
about
anything
else.
so
it
implies
the
limitation
of
illustrating
from
the
defense
of
our
system
of
criminal
justice
and
other
things
like
torture
or
banishment
would
be
outside
of
it.
in
most
instances
but
by
the
same
token
the
things
that
are
within
the
deprivations
of
life
or
liberty
or
property
would
not
be
unusual
unless
of
course
it
was
never
used
for
that
particular
crime.
for
example,
if
you
use
the
death
penalty
for
larceny
and
only
one
state
used
it
that
might
be
unusual
because
it
was
not
a
common
law,
well
it
was.
but
that
is
not
a
good
example.
but
i
think
you
see
what
i
mean
the
usefulness
of
the
three
types
of
penalty
was
taken
for
granted
and
was
certainly
even
more
than
that
would
put
right
into
the
constitution.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
life.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
liberty.
right.
and
here
we
are
talking
about
deprivation
of
life
and
then
it
becomes
only
a
matter
of
degree.
the
petitioners
here
say
that
its
excessive
for
rape
although
they
do
go
that
further
and
say
not
only
is
it
excessive
but
the
only
reason
that
they
are
imposing
it
in
itself
is
because
of
rape.
but
i
do
not
think
that
is
the
statistics.
certainly,
the
statistics
don't
show
that.
there
maybe
of
some
indication
that
more
negroes
have
imposed
upon
them
the
death
penalty
but
you
again
would
have
to
look
at
the
facts
of
the
crime
involved
to
see
whether
it
was
excessive
and
he
has
made
no
indication
here,
has
made
no
claim
and
no
allegations
that
it
was
excessive
in
this
case
but
only
if
excessive
in
that
sentence.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
it
is
an
abstract
principle,
that
is
right.
but
it
does
not
go
as
so
far
as
to
say
well
if
it
is
not
excessive
in
all
cases
then
it
is
excessive
in
this
one.
and
i
think
it
would
reach
and
i
tihnk
it
would
show
that
it
was.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
if
that
were
true
i
would
say
that
we
would
again
have
to
look
at
the
circumstances
of
the
crime
that
if
he
could
show,
make
out
what
this
court
in
terms
of
prima
facie
case
of
discriminations
in
sentencing,
then
of
course
it
would
be
on
an
individual
case
basis,
the
penalty
would
be
invalid
and
if
as
a
result,
no
jury
convicted
or
sentenced
to
white
man
or
no
jury
sentenced
to
black
man
again
for
the
crime
of
rape.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that
probably
would
be
a
prima
facie
case.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that
is
not
this
case
and
moreover
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
the
death
penalty
is
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
i
think
in
all
of
this,
i
mentioned
that
just
a
moment
before
that
we
have
to
look
also
at
the
crime
and
not
only
at
the
criminal
and
it
was
said
in
the
recent
case
of
state
versus
(inaudible)
in
new
jersey
in
1971,
i
think
it
was
pertinent.
the
first
right
of
the
individuals
to
be
protected
from
attack,
that
is
where
we
have
government
as
the
preambles
of
the
federal
constitutional
plainly
said,
in
the
words
of
chicago
versus
sturges
a
1911
united
states
supreme
court
case
primarily
governments
exists
for
the
maintenance
of
social
order.
hence
it
is
that
the
obligation
of
the
government
to
protect
life,
liberty
and
property
against
the
conduct
of
the
indifferent,
the
careless
and
the
evil
minded
maybe
regarded
as
long
at
the
very
foundation
of
the
social
compact.
the
bill
of
rights
was
not
intended
to
be
neither
a
primary
mission.
this
is
not
to
belittle
the
inestimable
rights
that
is
consecrated
but
rather
to
say
that
those
rights
may
not
be
related
to
speech.
the
very
reason
of
government
itself.
government
in
these
cases
has
determined
that
rape
and
murder
under
the
circumstances
of
these
cases.
there,
the
death
penalty
as
the
maximum
and
we
maintain
that
they
should
be
retained
as
penalty,
thank
you.
