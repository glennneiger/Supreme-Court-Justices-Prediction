justice

h.
rehnquist
mr.
amsterdam,
you
have
said
that
one
out
of
12
or
13
death
verdicts
is
returned
as
what
--
as
what
might
be
returned,
in
each
of
the
12
or
13
were
those
cases
which
the
prosecution
had
asked
for
death
or
was
it
just
the
death
could
have
been
returned
under
the
statute
if
the
prosecution
had
asked
for
it?
justice
william

mr.
amsterdam
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
amsterdam,
you
have
mentioned
a
couple
of
times
and
i
think
mrs.
beasley
also
mentioned
a
comparison
between
the
type
of
statistics
that
you
have
used
in
your
brief
and
the
type
of
statistics
that
the
state
has
used
and
you
would
state
in
your
brief
and
you
would
say
that,
here
is
--
yours
are
judicially
noticeable
whereas
you
feel
the
states
are
not.
i
could
not
find
in
your
brief
so
perhaps
i
am
in
position
unfamiliar
with
it
anything
other
than
just
the
statement
to
that
effect,
do
you
cover
in
your
brief
why
the
jurors
are
judicially
noticeable?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
do
not
have
no
ruling
under
in
this
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
bruder
is
that
not
a
provision
that
is
common
to
a
number
of
other
states
besides
texas?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
how
would
you
distinguish
that
in
the
situation
where
the
prosecutor
decides
to
prosecute
for
a
lesser
rather
than
a
greater
offense?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
the
prosecutor
seeks
the
death
penalty,
the
jury
is
perfectly
free
not
to
return
death
penalty?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
rape
under
texas
practice
is
the
evidence
as
to
the
element
of
damage
to
the
prosecutors
ordinarily
introducing
evidence
in
a
rape
prosecution,
is
that
a
necessary
element
of
the
crime?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
your
position
is
clear,
i
take
it
they
do
not
require
in
order
to
prove
any
essential
element
of
the
crime?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
bruder,
under
your
theory
of
the
eighth
amendment,
would
a
court
marshal
be
constitutionally
entitled
to
impose
the
death
penalty
upon
a
member
of
the
military
for
desertion
in
the
face
of
the
enemy?
