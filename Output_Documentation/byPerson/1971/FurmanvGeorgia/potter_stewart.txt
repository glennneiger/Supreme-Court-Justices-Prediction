justice

before

mr.

i
just
want
to
be
sure
that
i
understand
your
ultimate
argument.
is
it
this
that
even
if
assuming
that
retribution
as
a
--
is
a
permissible
ingredient
of
punishment,
even
assuming
that
rational
people
could
conclude
that
the
death
sentence
is
the
maximum
deterrent
with
the
minimum
unnecessary
cruelty,
death
in

chair.
even
assuming
we
are
dealing
with
somebody
who
is
not
capable
of
being
rehabilitated,
an
incorrigible
person.
even
assuming
that
rational
people
can
conclude
that
this
punishment
under
these
circumstances
is
the
most
efficient
and
the
most
inexpensive
and
the
most
--
and
that
it
assures
the
most
complete
isolation
of
a
convicted
man
from
ever
getting
back
in
the
society.
even
assuming
all
of
those
things
which
are
the
basic
arguments
made
by
your
brothers
and
sisters
on
the
other
side,
you
say
it
is
still
violative
of
the
eighth
amendment,
am
i
right
in
my
understanding
of
that?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
maybe
so.
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
that
is
what
i
understood
to
be
your
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
how
was
that
statute
invalidated?
by
the
court
or
by
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
on
what
basis?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
greenberg,
there
are
now
as
i
understand,
41
states
which
impose
capital
punishment
under
one
circumstance
or
another
plus
the
federal
government,
that
makes
42
to
mention
here.
out
of
those
42,
how
many
--
in
how
many
of
those
42
jurisdictions
are
there
now,
men
awaiting

there
are
700,

know,

no,

i
know
they
are
about
700
men

justice

in

justice

i

but
there
is

justice

(voice

what
you
are
talking
about
right
now
is
to
it.
justice
potter
stewart
but
may
i
miss.
beasley
on
the
other
hand
had
told
us
and
as
i
understood
it
that
in
any
given
case,
not
only
the
trial
courts
but
the
reviewing
court
will
consider
a
claim
that
the
punishment
imposed
in
that
case
was
inequitable
as
the
words
you
use.
i
do
not
know
that
is
the
jurisprudence
in
georgia
and
if
it
was
found
that
it
was,
it
will
examine
a
new
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
my
question
is
only
processed
by
what
i
am
sure
you
would
concede
that
the
crime
of
rape
covers
a
very
wide
spectrum.
it
can
go
from
extremely
as
sort
of
a
crime.
to
the
other
extreme
involving
would
say
as
adult
woman
or
a
former
boyfriend,
something
like
that
and
at
the
heinous
extreme
it
does
generally
involve
a
stranger.
justice
potter
stewart
circumstances
of
that
particular
case.
justice
potter
stewart
could
not
that
argument
be
directed
in
other
direction
mr.
wright
as
well.
here
we
have
generalized
statute
to
the
case
involving
rape.
you
say
it's
established
and
that's
the
statute
before
us
in
this
particular
case?
justice
potter
stewart
and
we
do
not
have
a
statute
before
us
involving
the
penalty
that
congress
may
have
imposed
for
the
assassination
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
and
it
might
be
that
the
death
penalty
for
a
highly
particularized
kind
such
as
that
might
be
constitutional,
but
that
this
legislation
now
before
us
might
not
be,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
certainly
as
you
were
beginning
to
suggest
in
your
argument,
that
even
if
one
accepts
it,
as
you
just
said,
that
the
death
penalty
per
se
is
not
a
violation
of
the
eighth
amendment,
it
does
not
follow
that
the
death
sentence
can
be
imposed
under
the
eighth
amendment
for
anything
within
the
state
legislature's
whim
as
well
such
as
petty
larceny,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
so
your
argument
is
that
at
some
point
rarity
would
be
relevant,
but
that
point
has
not
been
reached
yet?
justice
potter
stewart
faced
squarely
in
any
individual
case
under
the
equal
protection
clause?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
this
will
arise
in
the
context
of
an
individual
prosecution,
an
individual
conviction
and
an
individual
sentence
of
death
and
how
possibly
can
you
show,
given
the
secrecy
of
the
trial
jury
deliberation,
how
possibly
can
you
show
us
denial
of
equal
protection,
merely
by
showing
that
a
disproportionate
number
of
negroâ€™s
have
had
the
death
sentence
imposed
on
to
them
in
the
past
and
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case,
does
it,
i
mean,
with
my
hypothetical
case?
justice
potter
stewart
i
still
do
not
understand
your
answer
in
my
hypothetical
case.
how
would
it
begin
to
show
a
deprivation
of
equal
protection
in
an
individual
case
to
merely
show
that
in
the
past,
more
negros
than
white
people
have
been
given
the
death
penalty
in
rape
cases?
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
would
the
result
be,
to
set
aside
that
conviction
and
say
henceforth
no
negros
can
be
sentenced
to
death
or
white
people
can
be?
justice
potter
stewart
what
--
how
could
you
get
out
the
equal
protection
clause?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
this
theory
when
he
gets
a
prison
sentence.
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
you
are
not,
telling
him
about,
you
are
putting
capital
punishment
to
one
side,
how
does
your
theory
apply
to
terms
of
imprisonment
(inaudible)?
justice
potter
stewart
my
question
mr.
bruder
is
this.
you
suggest
that
at
least
arguendo
at
least
to
the
secondary
argument
in
this
particular
case
that
whatever
maybe
the
constitutionality
of
them
imposing
the
death
sentence
for
deliberate
and
premeditated
murder,
it
cannot
be
imposed
for
rape
or
indeed
for
any
other
offense
unless
a
life
has
been
taken.
so
that
is
the
argument
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
guess
--
i
wondered
where
that
theory
directed
with
respect
to
something
like
assault
battery,
unless
the
constitutional
outer
limit
to
the
punishment
for
that
to
the
eighth
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
not
an
important
question.
justice
potter
stewart
also
your
statistics,
you
cannot
tell
