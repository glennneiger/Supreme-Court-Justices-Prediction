unknown

in
georgia?
unknown

what
is
the
standard
would
you
use
to
determine
whether
any
part
of
the
bill
of
rights,
is
that
what
you
mean
it
would
be?
unknown

give
me,
i
can
get
it
later.
unknown
speaker
total
of
34?
unknown
speaker
we
do
not
know
if
that
includes
federal
government,
i
think
there
are
two
and
is
that
--
thank
you.
other
the
one
in
arkansas,
some
to
be
there,
is
that
--
since
the
governor
rockefeller's
through
--
unknown
speaker
could
that
be
done
in
georgia?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words
the
jury
comes
in
with
a
binding
of
the
conviction
and
then
imposing
a
sentence
for
19
years
in
penitentiary,
counsel
of
the
defendant
can
say
that
it
is
way
too
much
under
the
circumstances
that
the
defendants
consider
--
(voice
overlap)
unknown
speaker
does
the
court
have
the
power
to
change
the
verdict,
does
he?
unknown
speaker
i
am
talking
about
the
sentence,
i
thought
you
were
--
unknown
speaker
does
the
trial
judge
have
power
to
change
it
or
only
to
grant
a
new
trial?
unknown
speaker
but
the
jury’s
--
the
sentenced
imposed
by
the
jury
is
final
so
far
as
that
the
sentence.
the
trial
judge
does
not
have
power,
does
he?
if
the
tort
has
to
be
changed
the
sentence,
is
that
a
fact?
unknown
speaker
or
i
thought
alternatively
could
be
for
one
to
twenty
years
in
penitentiary.
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand
georgia,
is
this
and
you
tell
me
if
i
am
wrong,
if
the
jury
finds
some
defendant
is
guilty
of
rape,
it
can
impose,
a
sentence
of
imprisonment
anywhere
from
one
to
twenty
years
in
the
penitentiary
or
it
can
impose
a
death
sentence
or
it
can
impose
a
sentence
of
life.
unknown
speaker
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
nothing
between
20
years
and
life?
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
i
thought
in
1960.
unknown
speaker
i
understood
mr.
greenberg’s
argument
on
this
branch
of
the
case
to
be
directed
primarily
to
the
submission
that
this
is
a
highly
unusual
punishment.
highly
unusual
with
that
--
in
that
after
all
was
the
grant
of
certiorari
was
in
these
cases.
we
do
not
have
here
before
us
any
protection
plan.
unknown
speaker
but
whether
or
not
this
is
a
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
in
his
argument
in
this
branch
of
the
cases
was
directed
as
i
understood
it
to
submit
into
the
court
and
what
an
unusual
punishment
so
rarely
imposed,
it
would
impose
on
an
identifiable
fraction
of
the
defendant.
unknown
speaker
what
percentage
of
defendants
who
are
convicted
of
rape
are
given
the
death
penalty
in
georgia?
unknown
speaker
let
us
assume
it
was
1
in
a
hundred,
let
us
just
assume,
let
us
just
assume
that
it
was
1
in
a
hundred
rapist,
convicted
rapist
who
got
the
death
penalty.
i
am
not
saying
those
are
the
figures
but
let
us
assume
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
let
us
assume,
let
us
think
a
further
assumption
that
in
all
the
circumstances
of
all
hundred
cases
were
identical?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
it
does
but
would
say
then
that
the
infliction
of
the
death
penalty
was
unusual?
unknown
speaker
let
us
make
that
assumption
that
everyone
else
were
given
20
years,
i
am
not
talking
equal
protection,
i
am
just
talking
about
whether
imposition
of
death
penalty
is
unusual.
unknown
speaker
why
would
that
be,
why
would
you
deem
that
unusual?
unknown
speaker
but
what
is
the
--
would
it
not
--
unknown
speaker
so
you
would
say
no
matter
how
rare,
no
matter
how
rare
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
is,
the
state
has
the
power
to
impose
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
those
are
substantive
process
and
the
sentence
could
be
too
apparent.
unknown
speaker
do
you
give
any
simple
content
of
cruel
and
unusual
punishment?
unknown
speaker
but
what
about
management?
unknown
speaker
if
it
were
used
in
one
set
of
a
hundred,
the
state
would
have
the
stand.
it
would
have
the
power
to
do
it?
unknown
speaker
so
you
are
--
unknown
speaker
so
your
answer
to
the
rarity
of
the
imposition
of
capital
punishment,
to
rape
is
first
but
even
if
it
is
very
rare,
the
state
has
the
power
to
retain
it?
unknown
speaker
and
is
there
--
do
you
have
another
level
to
your
argument
secondly
what?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
what
i
wonder,
there
is
not,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
take
it,
do
you
say
that
it
is
rare
also
except
georgia.
unknown
speaker
is
it
unidentifiable?
is
not
that
kind
of
information
available
in
georgia,
out
of
so
many
convictions
for
rape,
how
many
of
them
in
the
death
penalty?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
your
opponent
purported
you
would
give
us
the
number
of
death
penalties
imposed
in
rape
cases.
unknown
speaker
well,
he
purported
you
would
give
us
the
figure
on
georgia
as
well?
unknown
speaker
but
even
if
it
were
one
in
a
hundred,
only
one
in
a
hundred,
you
would
say
that
they
would
have
the
power
to
impose
it.
unknown
speaker
i
kind
of
understood
you
to
say
that
there
was
--
you
did
have
a
second
string
to
your
constitutional
argument
unless
if
i
have
misunderstood
you
and
i
did
not
respond
to
the
question
just
now,
my
brother
white,
i
thought
you
have
told
him
that
unusual
did
not
as
a
constitutional
matter
within
the
phrase
used
in
the
eight
amendment
did
not
mean
simply
grant.
and
you
said
that
yes
it
would
be
if
it
were
only
one
in
a
thousand
that
would
be
the
extraordinary
rarity.
that
did
not
mean
that
was
unusual
within
the
meaning
of
the
eight
amendment.
and
i
gather
that
you
meant
that
that
word
in
the
eighth
amendment
meant
something
other
than
just
rare,
that
it
meant
something
like
some
sort
of
an
exotic
course
off
beat
sort
of
method
of
punishment
and
used
and
--
unknown
speaker
banishment,
i
thought
you
would
get
a
second
string,
you
used
both.
unknown
speaker
and
did
i
misunderstand
you?
unknown
speaker
three
types,
you
mean
deprivation
of
life
–
unknown
speaker
deprivation
of
property,
deprivation
of
liberty?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
excessive
in
this
case
and
in
all
cases?
unknown
speaker
in
what
kind
mr.
greenberg?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
is
there
a
way
of
avoiding
incidentally
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
in
georgia?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
standard
would
you
use
to

any

of
the

of
rights,
is
that
what
you
mean

give

i
can
get
it
