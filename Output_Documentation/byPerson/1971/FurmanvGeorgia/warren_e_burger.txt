arguments
next
in
69-5003,

against
georgia.c
mr.
amsterdam
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
they
do
it?
what
process
did
they
do
it
in
most
these
places.
mr.
amsterdam?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
is
not
the
process
that
could
generally
won
--
done
by
a
court
in
these
countries?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
if
the
courts
understook
to
accept
your
general
composition
on
the
cruel
and
unusual
aspect,
could
a
court
make
exceptions
to
it
for
a
certain
crime
or
would
it
--
would
the
court
be
obliged
to
follow
an
all
or
nothing
approach?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
could
the
court
for
example
make
an
exception
as
to
homicides
committed
by
a
life
term
prisoner
here
of
a
fellow
prisoner
or
the
guards?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(voice
overlap)
that
kind
of
a
narrow
exception
as
a
legislature
could?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
well
aware
of
course
that
great
many
opponents
of
capital
punishment,
among
them
james
bennett,
the
former
director
of
the
u.s.
prison
bill,
very
strongly
against
capital
punishment
as
a
matter
of
policy,
but
referring
to
retain
it
for
homicide
of
a
fellow
prisoner
or
a
prison
guard
and
i
am
sure
you
will
cover
that
in
some
detail
(ph).
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
we
would
then
could
accept
your
general
argument
and
still
find
such
a
statute,
one
that
did
not
offend
the
constitution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
amsterdam
you
were
speaking
of
pressures
on
the
legislature.
what
are
the
figures
now,
the
total
number,
something
over
600
in
death
row?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
700
people
on
death
row
would
be
quite
an
enormous
pressure
on
public
opinion,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
was
addressing
myself
at
least
suggesting
the
possibility
that
if
you
did
not
prevail
here
that
pressure
would
be
reactivated,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
amsterdam
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mrs.
beasley.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mrs.
beasley.
mr.
amsterdam,
you
have
three
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
your
time
is
up
mr.
amsterdam.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
69-5030,
jackson
against
georgia.
mr.
greenberg
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
his
amnesty
can
be,
the
20th
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
those
commendations
would
have
been
more
accurate?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
greenberg.
mrs.
bea1sley?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
beasley.
mr.
greenberg?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
greenberg,
did
she
not
add
to
that?
i
should
follow
her
to
say
that
would
make
a
prima
facie
case
out
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
perhaps.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
not
up
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
do
you
suggest
mr.
greenberg
on
its
terminology,
i
am
little
puzzled
by,
could
any
of
the
argument,
do
you
consider
that
punishment
is
unusual
simply
because
it
is
infrequent,
is
it?
the
term
in
the
constitution
is
synonymous
with
the
frequency
or
infrequency?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
historically
it
has
been
used.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
the
figures
on
georgia
mr.
greenberg.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
to
how
many
people
have
been
convicted
of
rape?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it
is
–
of
course
61
people,
and
everyone
convicted
of
rape
in
georgia,
that
would
not
be
very
unusual
about
it
about
–
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
about
61
cases.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
what
is
the
current
–-
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
greenberg,
thank
you
mrs.
beasley.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
number
69-5031,
branch
against
texas.
mr.
bruder.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
wright.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
just
another
way
of
saying
on
your
part
is
it
not
that
the
term
unusual
in
the
eighth
amendment
does
not
mean
or
at
least
does
not
voice
(inaudible)
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
are
other
--
another
element
is
quality
of
the
punishment
as
well
as
the
frequency
is
(inaudible)
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible).
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
about
say
the
guarantee,
there
would
be
a
physical
aspect
that
you
can
sometime
--
you
say
that
is
the
time
of
unusualness
in
which
the
constitution
would
address?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
right.
in
higher
term,
i
think
two
years
ago
and
earlier
in
this
term,
we
have
had
arguments
of
jury
in
wisconsin
(ph),
there
had
been
in
those
instances
all
are
all
tended
to
emphasize
as
many
of
them
did,
that
the
jury
is
the
barrier
between
the
individual
citizen
independence
and
the
portions
of
the
law
as
considered
to
be
(inaudible)
having
a
judge
do
it
alone
and
on
this
case,
it
seems
to
be
having
arguments
that
the
jury
fixing
the
penalty
do
not
consume
almost
as
prescribed
to
them.
the
jury
fixing
the
penalty
maybe
a
dangerous
thing
for
the
defendant.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
wright.
mr.
bruder
do
you
have
any
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.

thank
you
mr.
bruder,
thank
you
mr.

the

is
