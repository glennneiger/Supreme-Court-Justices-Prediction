mr.

mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
yes,
that
would
be
fine.
there's
laws
on
statute
books
which
makes
the
use
of
the
army
for
the
purposes
in
which
it
is
used
in
this
case
legally.
article
1,
section
8
of
the
constitution
empowers
congress
to
make
rules
for
the
government
and
regulation
of
the
land
and
naval
forces
and
to
provide
for
calling
forth
the
militia
to
enforce
the
laws
of
the
union,
suppress
insurrections
and
repel
invasion.
article
4,
section
4
of
the
constitution
provides
that
the
united
states
shall
protect
each
state
against
domestic
violence
if
it
is
requested
to
do
so
by
the
legislator
or
by
the
government
in
case
the
legislation
is
not
in
session.
congress
has
exercise
this
power
to
lay
down
rules
for
the
government
of
the
armed
forces
in
the
posse
comitatus
act,
which
was
an
act
in
1878
as
a
result
of
the
use
of
the
army
in
70
communities
in
south
carolina
to
enforce
laws,
and
as
a
result
of
the
practice
of
united
states
marshals
to
call
on
the
army
for
contingence,
to
asses
in
the
enforcement
of
the
law.
this
statute
says
this,
"whoever,
except
in
cases
and
under
circumstances
expressly
authorized
by
the
constitution
or
an
act
of
congress,
willfully
uses
the
army
and
it
has
not
been
admitted,
any
part
of
the
army
or
the
air
force
as
a
posse
comitatus
or
otherwise
to
execute
the
laws
shall
be
fined
not
more
than
$10,000.00
and
imprisoned
not
more
than
two
years
or
both."
now
manifest
that
statute,
both
thence
use
the
army
for
police
purposes
and
police
purposes
including
detective
learning.
so
it
forbids
the
use
of
the
army
for
detective
work.
there
are
statutes,
which
congress
has
based
sections
331,
332
and
333
of
title
18
of
the
united
states
code,
which
allowed
the
president
to
use
armed
forces
to
suppress
rebellion
and
insurrection
and
domestic
violence
of
a
high
magnitude.
the
first
of
these
statutes
is
in
harmony
with
article
4,
section
4
of
the
constitution
provides,
the
president
could
use
armed
forces
to
suppress
an
insurrection
against
the
states
if
it's
requested
by
state
authorities
so
to
do.
the
second
provides
that
the
president
can
use
armed
forces
to
suppress
a
rebellion
against
this
federal
authority,
which
impedes
the
enforcement
of
the
federal
laws
by
the
normal
force
of
action
in
the
judicial
proceedings.
and
the
third
provides
that
the
president
can
use
the
armed
forces
when
the
such
domestic
violence
within
the
boarders
of
the
state
that
it
impedes
the
execution
of
the
federal
and
state
laws
to
certain
extent
that
the
place
of
citizens
is
deprived
of
a
right
named
in
the
constitution
and
secured
by
law
and
the
state
refuses
or
fails
or
is
unable
to
suppress
the
insurrection
or
the
domestic
violence.
now,
these
statutes
are
subject
to
limitation,
which
is
upheld.
it
says
before
the
president
could
invoke
anyone
of
these
three
statutes
and
use
the
armed
forces
that
the
president
must
issue
a
proclamation
calling
upon
the
insurgents
to
disperse
and
to
return
to
their
places
of
abode
within
a
reasonable
time.
that's
the
conditions
under
which
the
army
can
be
used
and
these
conditions
didn't
exist
with
reference
to
these
plaintiffs.
now
it
manifest,
if
the
president
can
use
armed
forces
to
the
easy
use
of
public
proclamation,
the
army
cannot
be
used
as
a
detective
force
as
was
used
in
this
case.
and
in
the
past
that
it
was
used
in
all
that
army
might
be
able
to
engage
in
the
role
of
a
prophet
and
predict
when
and
where
there
might
be
an
insurrection
or
domestic
violence
and
where
the
president
might
in
the
future
call
them
out.
that's
what
this
is.

the
government's
argument
in
brief
takes
a
leaf
out
of
notebook
that
all
lawyers
who
use
to
file
and
speak
in
demurs.
they
asked
this
court
to
determine
the
sufficiency
of
the
complaint
not
on
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
but
on
the
allegations
of
some
affidavits,
which
were
recently
irrelevant
to
own
an
opposition
to
the
motion
of
the
plaintiffs
in
the
district
court
for
a
preliminary
injunction.
they're
not
relevant
to
the
question
presented
in
this
court.
now,
when
though
the
complaint
in
this
case
is
interpreted
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
plaintiffs
and
all
doubts,
all
result
in
their
favor
as
the
rule
applicable
to
a
challenge
to
sufficiency
of
the
complaint
it
requires.
this
complaint
makes
these
allegations
first,
that
the
plaintiffs
and
others
similarly
situated
are
civilians
having
no
connection
with
the
army
who
dissent
from
policies
of
government
in
respect
to
the
draft,
the
war
in
southeast
asia
and
certain
racial
violence.
second,
that
the
plaintiffs
and
other
similarly
situated
are
exercising
on
the
peaceful
fashion
that
first
amendment
rights
of
freedom
of
speech,
association
or
similarly
in
petition
to
express
that
dissent,
convert
others
to
their
views
and
persuade
government
to
all
of
the
policies
to
which
they
dissent.
third,
that
although
the
plaintiffs
and
other
similar
situated
are
exercising
their
first
amendment
rights
peaceably.
the
army
has
required
1000
military
intelligence
agents
operating
out
of
300
stations
throughout
the
nation
and
additional
intelligence
units
while
all
the
substantial
forces
of
the
army
are
stationed
to
exercise
surveillance
both
overt
and
covert
all
of
the
plaintiffs.
and
that
these
military
intelligence
agents
and
personnel
overtly
and
covertly
collecting
information
concerning
the
personal
thoughts,
the
political
activities
and
views
of
the
plaintiffs
and
other
similar
situated
and
storing
it
in
dossiers
and
computers,
and
exchanging
it
to
some
of
the
information
concerning
them
gathered
by
federal
investigative
agencies
such
as
fbi
and
the
secret
service
and
state
and
local
law
enforcement
agencies
and
are
making
all
of
such
information
available
to
all
american
military
units
throughout
the
united
states,
europe
and
to
all
the
federal
departments
and
agencies
engaged
in
hiring
employees
and
the
state
of
local
law
enforcement
agencies.
fourth,
that
the
army's
engaging
in
these
activities
to
deter
the
plaintiffs
and
other
similar
situated
from
exercising
their
first
amendment
rights
to
dissent
the
governmental
policies
stated,
and
to
influence
others
to
join
them
in
petitioning
government
to
abandon
all
such
policies.
and
the
army
as
accomplishing
this
purpose
and
its
excellent
deterring
the
plaintiffs
and
other
similar
situated
from
exercising
their
first
amendment
rights
for
the
purpose
stated.
and
is
damaging
their
reputations
and
impairing
opportunities
as
citizens
to
obtain
employment
at
the
hands
of
the
federal
government
or
others
feels
that
the
activities
of
the
army
exceed
any
legitimate
needs
of
the
army
and
then
authorized
below.
fifth
--
sixth,
that,
plaintiffs
have
no
adequate
remedy
at
law
and
unless
until
the
court
raise
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
to
hold
the
activities
described
in
the
compliant,
irreparable
injury
will
continue
to
be
done
to
plaintiffs
and
all
those
similar
situated
as
well
as
a
national
interest.
i
am
going
to
make
one
observation
with
respect
to
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
which
cover
the
exhibits
about
44
pages.
if
these
allegations
do
not
state
a
cause
of
action
in
which
judicial
relief
can
be
granted
within
the
purview
of
the
case
or
controversy
close
of
the
third
article
of
the
constitution,
the
star-spangled
banner
lasts
when
it
says,
that
our
country
is
a
land
of
the
free.
i
believe
our
country
is
a
land
of
the
free
and
i
believe
this
court
believes
that
our
country
is
a
land
of
the
free.
and
for
that
reason,
i
feel
i
am
justified
in
asking
this
court
to
affirm
the
ruling
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
adjudges
the
complaint
to
be
sufficient
and
remands
the
court
to
the
--
the
case
to
the
district
court
to
be
tried
on
the
merits
with
the
state
when
that
date
will
determine
after
trials
on
the
merits
establishes
the
fact
whether
injunctive
and
declaratory
relief
should
be
granted.

for
that

i
feel
i
am
justified
in
asking
this
court
to
affirm
the
ruling
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
adjudges
the
complaint
to
be
sufficient
and
remands
the
court
to
the
--
the
case
to
the
district
court
to
be
tried
on
the
merits
with
the
state
when
that
date
will
determine

the
fact
whether
injunctive
and
declaratory
relief
should
be
granted.
