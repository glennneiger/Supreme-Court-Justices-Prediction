allegation

under

before
me

justice

--
it
is
a
little
ambiguous.
electronic
equipment
of
course
could
include
a
tape
recorder
at
a
public
meeting.
and
in
its
context
here
with
the
use
of
photographic
and
electronic
equipment,
that
would
almost
seem
the
meaning
to
be
ascribed
to
it,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
there's
no
allegation,
any
specific
or
explicit
allegations
or
wire
tapping
or
what
became
known
as
bugging
or
anything
at
that
nature
here
that
i've
been
able
to
find.
justice
potter
stewart
in
short,
i
am
right
am
i
not
in
understanding
this
complaint
as
not
relying
on
the
fourth
amendment
but
rather
on
the
first
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
the
ninth
and
tenth
and
the
few
others
but
it's
basically
a
first
amendment
complaint?
justice
potter
stewart
not
the
fourth
amendment
rights
as
such,
that's
not
the
gravamen
of
the
complaint?
justice
potter
stewart
okay.
justice
potter
stewart
i'd
understood
the
government's
argument
and
this
plays
the
case
at
least
in
terms
of
standing
to
be
that
certainly
there
would
be
judicial
review
on
when
any
individual
plaintiff
could
show
that
he
had
been
actually
injured
just
as
a
matter
of
standing.
justice
potter
stewart
or
perhaps,
justiciable
controversy
or
cases
or
controversy,
we
all
agree
these
concepts
run
into
each
other
and
overlap
the
deal.
justice
potter
stewart
well
he'll
find
out
if
he
lost
his
job
or
if
he
were
denied
the
clearance
to
some
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
confidential
information
in
a
place
where
he
works
or
at
a
variety
of
other
ways
at
which
are
reflected
in
many
of
the
decisions
in
this
court.
if
he
were
denied
a
job
at
a
defense
facility
or
something
to
that
kind,
he
could
show
that
he
was
hurt.
