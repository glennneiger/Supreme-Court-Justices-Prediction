mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
the
government's
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
a
divided
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
the
question
before
that
court
was
whether
the
district
court
had
rightly
dismissed
the
complaint
filed
in
that
court
on
february
17,
1970
by
the
parties
who
are
respondents
here.
the
complaint
was
dismissed
by
the
district
cour0t
without
the
production
of
any
evidence.
thus,
the
case
arises
here
on
the
complaint
in
the
district
court,
the
motion
to
dismiss
and
certain
affidavits,
which
were
filed
in
connection
with
these
matters.
in
their
brief,
the
respondents
say
that,
and
i
quote,
"the
government
has
persistently
attempted
to
convert
this
case
into
something
other
than
the
case
brought
by
the
plaintiffs."
i'm
afraid
that's
the
way
we
feel
about
the
respondents.
we
think
that
the
case
is
in
the
appendix
while
they
try
to
present
it
on
the
basis
of
two
volumes
of
hearings
before
the
senate
subcommittee
on
civil
rights.
i'm
reminded
of
lord
mcnaughton's
remark
about
the
rule
in
shelley's
case
when
he
said
that
it
is
one
thing
to
put
the
case
in
a
nutshell
and
another
thing
to
keep
it
there.
the
complaint
filed
in
the
district
court
was
filed
by
four
individuals
and
nine
unincorporated
associations.
it
is
framed
as
a
class
action
on
behalf
of
all
other
individuals
and
organizations
and
i
read
from
page
8
of
the
appendix,
"all
other
individuals
and
organizations
who
wish
to
exercise
their
right
under
the
first
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
to
engage
in
peaceful
political
protest,
demonstrations,
marches,
rallies,
church
meetings
and
other
forms
of
constitutionally
protected
expression
and
assemblies
without
surveillance
by
defendants
agents
and
without
becoming
the
subject
of
dossiers,
reports
and
files,
defendants'
data
bank
and
intelligence
network."
the
complaint
then
contains
allegations
that
the
army
had
been
conducting
surveillance
of
lawful
and
peaceful
civilian
activity
within
the
united
states
and
that
this
information
is
stored
in
a
computerized
data
bank.
in
exhibit
"a"
attached
to
the
complaint,
they
gave
a
sample
of
the
sort
of
material,
which
has
been
compiled.
this
appears
on
pages
13
to
21
of
the
appendix
and
i
would
like
to
read
a
few
examples
beginning
on
page
14
in
hartford,
connecticut,
march
11,
1968.
approximately
20
persons
picketed
outside
the
u.s.
federal
building.
the
protestors
carried
placards
denouncing
the
war
in
vietnam
and
the
payment
of
income
tax.
the
demonstration
was
sponsored
by
the
voluntown
connecticut
chapter
of
the
new
england
committee
for
nonviolent
action.
and
on
page
16,
san
jose,
california,
an
anti-dow
chemical
company
demonstration
was
held
in
front
of
the
administration
building
at
san
jose
state
college.
a
crowd
of
about
400
to
500
persons
were
present
but
approximately
90%
of
these
were
spectators
or
curious
onlookers.
at
1230
hours,
the
demonstrators
moved
to
the
morris
dailey
auditorium
where
they
were
refused
permission
to
hold
a
rally.
san
jose
state
college
officials
however
permitted
the
protestors
to
use
the
music
building
for
an
afternoon
rally.
the
rally
received
very
little
support
and
attendance
was
light.
now,
i
am
not
going
to
read
others
of
those
items
but
it's
apparent
that
they're
the
kind
of
items
that
constantly
appear
in
the
newspapers,
information
of
very
little
significance
and
not
at
all
repressive
in
its
nature.
there's
also
attached
to
the
complaint
as
an
exhibit
a
copy
of
an
article
by
captain
christopher
h.
pyle
in
which
appeared
in
the
january
1970
issue
of
a
publication
called
the
washington
monthly.
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
publication
of
this
article
was
the
immediate
reason
for
the
bringing
of
this
suit.
there
are
no
allegations
in
the
complaint
that
any
specific
harm
or
injury
has
been
done
to
any
of
the
plaintiffs
either
individual
or
the
unincorporated
associations.
it
was
alleged
that
this
type
of
activity
has
a
chilling
effect
on
the
plaintiffs
and
other
seeking
to
exercise
their
first
amendment
rights.
there
is
no
allegation
in
the
complaint
that
there
was
any
surveillance
of
any
wholly
private
activity.
what
is
charged
is
that
the
members
of
the
military
went
to
public
meetings
and
rather
elaborately
recorded
what
they
saw.
before
proceeding
further,
i
should
call
attention
to
some
background
facts.
there
is
no
rigid
dichotomy
between
military
and
civilian
in
this
country.
both
the
constitution
and
the
statutes
provide
for
the
use
of
the
military
and
domestic
civilian
context,
the
military
is
at
all
times
subject
to
civilian
control
through
the
president
as
commander
in
chief
and
the
secretary
of
defense
and
the
secretaries
and
other
civilian
officers
of
the
three
branches
of
the
armed
forces.
a
high
proportion
of
adult
american
males
including
many
members
of
congress
and
the
courts
have
served
in
the
military
for
a
time.
many
of
them
retained
their
civilian
outlook
as
is
shown
clearly
by
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
filed
here.
over
the
past
20
years,
the
military
has
been
called
on
many
times
to
supplement
civilian
power.
on
some
occasions
to
enforce
decisions
of
the
courts
including
this
court
and
on
many
other
occasions
to
help
to
restore
and
to
maintain
order
in
many
of
our
cities.
this
was
done
in
detroit
in
july
1967.
it
was
done
in
april
1968
here
in
washington
and
in
chicago,
and
in
baltimore,
and
in
other
cities.
i
remember
coming
to
the
calm
of
this
courtroom
on
the
monday
after
the
death
of
martin
luther
king.
there
was
smoke
in
the
air
and
a
soldier
on
every
street
corner
as
i
passed.
the
court
set
but
a
number
of
the
persons
whose
admission
i
was
to
move
that
day
did
not
get
here.
we
can
recall
too
that
the
warrant
commission
reported
that
advanced
intelligence
had
not
been
adequate
for
the
protection
of
the
president
and
recommended
that
greater
steps
be
taken
to
a
compiled
data
about
person
who
might
be
inclined
to
violence.
a
similar
recommendation
was
made
by
the
kerner
commission
in
1968.
today,
we
provide
a
guard
not
only
for
the
president
and
the
vice
president
but
also
for
every
presidential
candidate
and
the
last
with
reason.
if
the
army
is
to
have
the
function
in
helping
to
preserve
order
in
the
civilian
society,
it
must
have
some
intelligence
information.
how
much
is
of
course
an
important
question
but
it
must
have
some.
as
the
court
below
said,
it
cannot
be
expected
that
the
army
should
use
its
force
blindly.
in
the
summer
of
1968,
the
past
was
sad
and
the
future
was
uncertain.
this
was
when
the
army
began
to
expand
its
intelligence
gathering
activities.
from
my
point
of
view,
it
went
too
far
or
perhaps
to
put
it
in
other
way,
there
was
an
absence
of
adequate
civilian
control.
one
of
the
problems
of
an
army
is
that
you
ordinarily
have
to
far
more
people
than
you
have
any
use
for
because
you
have
to
have
enough
people
at
the
right
place
when
the
need
arises.
here,
the
army
had
a
lot
of
people
in
intelligence.
they
spent
more
than
90%
of
their
time
in
investigating
people
who
needed
clearances
for
military
or
civilian
employment.
but
they
had
men
remaining.
and
they
received
directives
that
they
were
to
build
up
intelligence
for
use
in
case
the
military
were
needed
in
connection
with
civilian
disturbances.
so
they
build
up
the
material
we
see
here.
and
they
had
a
computer
and
they
put
all
of
this
on
the
computer.
and
from
the
computer,
they
build
up
a
list
of
the
names
which
appeared
in
the
data
which
the
plaintiffs
call
a
blacklist.
from
my
point
of
view,
it
was
poor
judgment,
and
inappropriate
use
of
military
resources.
as
secretary
of
the
army,
froelke
has
said
and
i
quote
"from
the
vantage
point
of
hindsight,
the
guidance
and
direction
to
the
military
for
a
collection
of
civil
disturbance
information
was
too
often
general
and
oral
rather
than
in
written
form."
or
in
senator
ervin's
words,
"some
people
charged
with
responsibility
in
this
especially
at
the
local
level
got
a
little
bit
too
zealous
in
their
activity."
with
this
summary
statement
of
the
facts
for
the
case
arises
on
the
complaint,
the
motion
to
dismiss
and
the
accompanying
exhibits
and
affidavits
as
included
in
the
appendix,
i
would
like
to
summarize
our
legal
position.
first,
the
complaint
does
not
allege
a
justiciable
controversy.
and
related
to
that,
the
plaintiffs
do
not
have
standing
to
maintain
the
case.
there
is
a
controversy
all
right,
but
it
is
not
a
case
or
controversies
in
the
constitutional
sense.
second,
what
was
done
as
alleged
in
the
complaint
on
why
is
it,
it
may
have
been
did
not
violate
the
constitution
or
any
statute.
third,
if
there
was
anything
done
that
was
legally
wrong
and
the
case
is
justiciable,
it
has
been
stopped.
and
fourth,
in
this
situation,
i
do
not
claim
mootness
in
the
strict
sense
but
the
case
is
not
one
now
if
it
ever
was
in
which
there
is
equity
jurisdiction.
that
is
in
which
it
is
appropriate
for
a
court
of
equity
to
intervene
by
way
of
injunction.
let
me
turn
first
to
the
question
of
justiciability.
as
i
have
already
said,
no
plaintiff
alleges
that
anything
has
been
done
to
injure
him,
the
whole
cause
of
action
rest
on
chills.
i
know
of
no
decision
of
this
court,
which
has
been
based
on
chill
alone.
in
every
case
in
which
chill
has
been
a
factor,
there
has
been
a
criminal
prosecution
either
in
process
or
immediately
threatened
or
there
had
been
governmental
attempts
to
compel
disclosure
of
information
as
a
prerequisite
to
entitlement
to
government
employment
or
benefits.
there
was
an
individual
before
the
court
who
said
that
he
was
injured
in
some
immediate
and
concrete
fashion.
here,
the
complaint
proceeds
only
on
the
broadest
of
generalities.
it
states
on
page
10
of
the
appendix
and
i
quote,
"that
the
purpose
and
effect
of
the
collection,
maintenance,
and
distribution
of
the
information
on
civilian,
political
activity
described
herein
is
to
harass
and
intimidate
plaintiffs
and
others
similarly
situated,
yet
they
do
not
allege
a
single
instance
of
harassment
or
intimidation."
they
do
allege
generally
an
invasion
of
their
privacy,
damage
to
their
reputations
and
an
adverse
effect
on
their
employment.
but
they
cite
no
specific
instance
or
example.
the
dissenting
judge
in
the
court
below
called
these
indefinite
claims
of
highly
visionary
apprehensions.
they
do
not
--
we
submit
of
the
concreteness
and
sufficiency
of
focus
to
make
the
claims
justiciable.
there
is
no
assertion
here
that
the
activity
complained
of
has
cause
direct
injury
to
these
plaintiffs
or
to
others
similarly
situated.
instead,
they
appear
here
as
they
have
said
various
times
in
their
arguments
below
and
then
in
their
briefs,
on
behalf
of
millions
of
people.
but
when
you
appear
on
behalf
of
millions
of
people,
the
case
is
no
longer
concrete
and
specific.
that
is
the
sort
of
thing,
which
is
appropriate
for
consideration
by
the
legislative
branch
or
the
executive
but
does
not
present
a
case
for
decision
by
a
court.
the
case
is
much
like
the
situation
in
united
public
workers
against
mitchell,
a
case
which
they
cite
once
but
skip
over
very
quickly
where
the
court
refused
to
find
a
generalized
claim
as
to
the
validity
of
the
hot
check
to
be
justiciable.
justiciability
is
not
a
mere
technicality.
illusive
as
it
may
be,
it
is
an
expression
of
one
of
the
basic
concepts
on
which
our
constitution
rests
the
separation
of
powers.
the
courts
exercise
judicial
power
under
the
constitution.
this
is
not
the
power
to
decide
all
the
questions
of
law,
which
arise
in
the
course
of
the
administration
of
the
government.
it
is
the
power
to
act
as
a
court,
to
decide
the
concrete
and
specific
issues
which
arise
between
men
and
men
or
between
the
citizen
and
his
government.
when
someone
says,
he
did
this
to
me
and
i
am
hurt.
this
is
not
the
power
to
respond
when
the
complainant
says,
i
don't
like
the
way
the
government
is
acting.
i
am
not
hurt
but
i
might
be
someday
and
i
want
this
stopped.
general
questions
arising
with
respect
to
structure
and
the
administration
of
the
government
are
best
resolved
by
the
two
other
coordinate
branches
established
by
the
constitution.
the
executive
administers
better
than
the
courts
are
equipped
to
administer
and
the
congress
formulates
general
policies
with
more
responsiveness
to
the
democratic
process
than
the
courts
can.
the
courts
with
their
independence
are
better
qualified
to
deal
with
concrete
cases
of
alleged
wrong,
which
directly
affect
the
complainant.
but
the
court
should
not
undertake
to
decide
all
the
questions
which
arise
in
government.
this
case
i
think
is
a
specific
example.
if
the
court
is
to
grant
relief,
it
maybe
of
two
forms,
(a)
it
may
say
that
the
army
is
enjoined
from
conducting
any
and
all
intelligence
operations
involving
civilians
under
any
circumstances.
i
think
that
would
be
wrong.
i
suppose
there
was
a
plot
to
blow
up
an
arsenal
or
sink
a
troop
ship
for
example.
or
suppose
the
army
was
actually
engaged
in
riot
control
operations
in
washington
or
detroit
or
chicago.
the
court
could
hardly
deny
the
army
the
resources
to
protect
this
personnel
or
to
maintain
its
legally
assigned
mission.
if
that
alternative
won't
do,
that
is
absolute
forbidding
to
do
any
civilian
intelligence
work,
then
the
alternative
is
(b)
to
workout
in
detail
what
the
army
may
and
may
not
do
under
variant
circumstances
and
subject
to
change
from
time
to
time
and
from
place
to
place.
that
is
administration
and
the
courts
are
not
equipped
to
carry
on
administration.
we
can
hardly
have
a
situation
where
a
colonel
or
a
captain
confronted
with
an
immediate
problem
in
seattle
or
in
syracuse
would
have
to
say,
well,
i
can't
act.
i
will
have
to
apply
to
the
united
states
district
court
and
the
district
of
columbia
to
get
a
modification
of
the
injunction
in
view
of
the
circumstances
which
confront
me.
managing
things
in
this
way
is
not
judicial
action.
disputes,
which
can
lead
only
to
such
control
of
another
branch
of
government,
are
not
justiciable.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there's
no
suggestion
here
that
anything
has
been
searched
or
seized,
reasonable
or
unreasonable.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
is
no
suggestion
in
this
complaint
that
there
was
electronic
surveillance.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice,
it
did
have
but
as
i
will
point
out,
it
has
stopped
them
on
these
matters.
in
addition
to
the
executive
to
administer
a
very
important
lay
on
this
area,
there's
the
legislative
branch
of
the
government.
many
other
problems
here
are
well
suited
to
the
sort
of
general
policymaking,
which
the
congress
can
do.
if
congress
can
device
appropriate
means
to
regulate
the
military
in
this
area,
it
has
the
power
to
do
so.
the
senate
has
already
held
extensive
hearings
on
this
specific
question
and
a
number
of
bills
have
been
introduced.
and
as
i
shall
indicate
below,
the
executive
has
also
taken
clear
and
specific
action.
but,
second,
if
the
case
is
justiciable,
if
the
plaintiffs
have
adequate
standing
then
we
say,
that
it
is
a
matter
of
law,
the
complaint
does
not
state
a
cause
of
action
on
the
merits.
however
unwise
the
actions
may
have
been
and
in
my
judgment,
they
went
far
beyond
anything
that
was
appropriate
for
the
military
to
do
as
the
department
of
defense
and
the
army
have
recognized,
they
did
not
violate
the
constitution
or
any
provision
of
the
law.
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
that
anything
that
was
done
was
evil
or
malicious.
and
no
allegation
that
the
materials
were
in
fact
misused.
there
is
no
allegation
that
anyone
was
deprived
of
his
freedom
of
speech
which
is
what
the
first
amendment
says.
indeed,
not
much
was
generally
known
about
the
army's
activities
until
the
publication
of
captain
pyle's
article
on
the
filing
of
this
suit.
those
were
in
my
opinion
useful
acts
but
they
were
also
the
immediate
cause
of
whatever
shivering
there
may
be.
they
have
led
to
uninhibited
robust
and
wide-open
debate,
which
i
suppose
is
one
of
the
objectives
of
the
first
amendment
as
this
court
has
said.
they
have
led
the
tighter
civilian
control,
which
is
desired.
they
have
led
to
extensive
consideration
of
the
problem
by
the
congress
which
is
appropriate.
but
there
is
i
submit
no
action
taken
by
the
army
alleged
in
this
complaint,
which
violates
anything
literally
contained
in
the
constitution
and
nothing
done
which
violates
anything
implied
from
the
constitution
as
far
as
this
court's
decision
have
gone.
third,
if
there
was
anything
done
here
which
was
illegal,
it
has
been
stopped.
to
show
this,
i
have
to
go
outside
the
appendix
but
i
believe
that
is
justified
under
this
court's
decisions
for
everything
that
which
i
refer
as
a
matter
of
official
acts.
and
for
support
on
that,
i
would
refer
to
this
court's
decision
last
term
in
the
allard
case.
in
this
case,
the
official
actions
were
numerous
and
clear.
two
of
them
are
included
in
the
appendix
to
our
main
brief.
numerous
others
are
set
out
in
volume
2
of
the
hearings
before
the
senate
committee
on
constitutional
rights.
it
may
seem
odd
that
i
refer
to
these
hearings
in
connection
with
our
case
while
saying
that
the
hearings
themselves
cannot
be
utilized
to
make
this
a
different
case
from
that
which
is
presented
in
this
record.
but
i
believe
the
distinction
is
clear,
the
respondents
want
to
use
the
hearings
as
a
repository
of
evidence
to
establish
facts
which
are
not
alleged
in
their
complaint.
that
is
to
make
this
a
different
case
from
what
it
is
in
the
complaint.
my
reference
to
the
hearings
is
simply
as
a
convenient
place
in
which
the
court
can
find
the
text
of
official
actions,
which
shows
that
the
practices,
which
the
respondents
here
complain
about,
have
been
stopped.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i
think
you
cannot
take
judicial
notice
of
the
evidence
and
testimony,
which
was
presented
before
that
hearing.
i
think
you
can
take
judicial
notice
of
the
official
actions,
which
among
other
places
are
recorded
in
volume
2
of
those
hearings.
as
i
have
said,
the
surveillance
has
been
stopped,
the
computer
banks
and
printouts
have
been
destroyed,
the
index
list
of
names
or
blacklist,
have
been
destroyed.
in
each
case,
one
copy
has
been
retained
for
the
purposes
of
this
litigation.
we
did
not
want
to
restore,
destroy
all
for
fear
of
someone
who
would
say
that
we
had
improperly
interfered
with
the
due
administration
of
justice.
but
that
one
copy
is
in
good
hands
and
will
be
destroyed
as
soon
as
this
litigation
is
terminated
or
the
court
has
given
us
the
authority
to
act.
it's
true
that
the
respondents
say
that
we
cannot
certify
that
every
single
copy
has
been
destroyed
but
the
copies
were
not
numbered.
but
it
is
clear
that
there
has
been
a
bona
fide
effort
to
recall
and
destroy
every
copy
and
orders
have
been
given
against
the
utilization
of
any
copy.
i
do
not
think
that
more
can
be
done
even
under
the
orders
of
a
court.
in
this
circumstance,
we
do
not
say
that
the
case
is
necessarily
moot.
in
some
situations,
past
action
is
sufficient
to
aviate
mootness
even
though
the
action
has
been
stopped.
we
do
say
however
that
the
actions
taken
by
the
army
are
sufficient
to
destroy
equity
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court.
we
sometimes
forget
that
equity
has
a
jurisprudence
of
its
own
and
one
of
the
principles
of
equity
is
that
it
does
not
utilize
the
mighty
remedy
of
injunction
when
the
conduct
complained
of
has
been
stopped
in
the
absence
of
extraordinary
circumstances
such
as
a
substantial
risk
that
the
conduct
will
be
resumed
if
this
court
does
not
intervene.
this
is
essentially
the
basis
of
this
courts
recent
decision
in
the
medical
committee
on
human
rights
case.
here,
there
is
no
such
risk.
i
feel
sure
that
the
court
will
find
that
the
actions
of
the
secretary
of
defense,
of
the
secretary
of
army
and
of
other
defense
officials
are
clear,
vigorous
and
in
good
faith.
it
is
said
that
these
officials
cannot
control
the
army
that
the
army
will
go
ahead
and
watch
civilians
anyway.
if
they
can't
succeed,
i
am
inclined
to
doubt
that
the
district
court
would
be
more
successful.
i
think
that
the
situations
are
different.
today,
from
what
they
have
been
sometimes
in
the
past
that
the
officials
of
the
army
are
alert
and
determined.
it
is
much
better
i
submit
to
leave
the
resolution
of
the
details
of
carrying
out
their
directives
to
the
civilian
army
authorities
than
to
have
the
intervention
of
the
courts.
thus,
if
the
case
is
justiciable,
is
the
actions
of
the
army
in
conducting
surveillance
of
civilians
did
violate
the
constitution
and
the
laws,
i
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
district
court
should
nevertheless
be
affirmed
since
the
actions
of
the
army
have
now
been
terminated,
and
though
the
district
court
did
have
jurisdiction
of
the
case
if
the
records
of
jurisdictional
amount
was
present,
it
is
not
as
of
now
a
case
within
the
principles
of
equity
jurisdiction
where
the
wrong
no
longer
continues,
courts
do
not
ordinarily
issue
an
injunction,
there
should
be
no
injunction
here.
the
decision
below
should
be
reversed
and
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
with
one
exception,
i
do
not
think
that
i
have
misrepresented
the
complaint
here
and
certainly
i
have
not
intended
to
do
so.
that
one
exception
was
in
my
answer
to
the
question
from
mr.
justice
douglas
when
i
said
there
was
no
allegation
about
the
electronic
surveillance.
it
is
true
that
there
is
a
reference
through
the
use
of
photographic
and
electronic
equipment
on
page
9.
in
my
response,
what
i
had
in
mind
was
wiretapping
and
bugging.
there
is
no
specific
allegation
with
respect
to
that.
in
all
of
the
hearings,
there
is
no
evidence
that
such
action
was
taken.
there
is
some
evidence
that
there
was
video
tape,
which
i
suppose
is
electronic
but
is
more
closely
analogous
to
photographic
and
to
what
we
usually
have
in
mind
when
we
say
electronic.
now,
with
respect
to
the
other
items
on
the
meaning
of
the
complaint
and
the
complaint
itself
is
only
seven
pages
long
and
of
course
the
court
will
decide
it
on
the
basis
of
what
it
finds
in
the
complaint.
but
i
would
call
attention
to
the
opinion
of
the
majority
of
the
court
below
on
page
137
of
the
record.
appellants
freely
admit
that
they
complained
of
no
specific
action
of
the
army
against
them,
only
the
existence
and
operation
of
the
intelligence
gathering
and
distributing
system
which
is
confined
to
the
army
and
related
civilian
investigative
agencies.
there
is
no
evidence
of
illegal
or
unlawful
surveillance
activities.
we
are
not
sided
to
any
clandestine
intrusion
by
a
military
agency.
and
then
the
dissenting
judge,
judge
mckinnon
below
in
footnote
2
at
the
bottom
of
page
149
of
his
opinion,
there
are
no
allegations
that
the
army
has
conducted
surveillance
of
wholly
private
activity
and
at
all
argument,
appellants
indicated
in
effect
that
they
did
not
have
any
witnesses
who
would
testify
that
the
army
had
engaged
in
such
activity.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
the
government's
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
a
divided
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
the
question
before
that
court
was
whether
the
district
court
had
rightly
dismissed
the
complaint
filed
in
that
court
on
february
17,
1970
by
the
parties
who
are
respondents
here.
the
complaint
was
dismissed
by
the
district
cour0t
without
the
production
of
any
evidence.
thus,
the
case
arises
here
on
the
complaint
in
the
district
court,
the
motion
to
dismiss
and
certain
affidavits,
which
were
filed
in
connection
with
these
matters.
in
their
brief,
the
respondents
say
that,
and
i
quote,
"the
government
has
persistently
attempted
to
convert
this
case
into
something
other
than
the
case
brought
by
the
plaintiffs."
i'm
afraid
that's
the
way
we
feel
about
the
respondents.
we
think
that
the
case
is
in
the
appendix
while
they
try
to
present
it
on
the
basis
of
two
volumes
of
hearings
before
the
senate
subcommittee
on
civil
rights.
i'm
reminded
of
lord
mcnaughton's
remark
about
the
rule
in
shelley's
case
when
he
said
that
it
is
one
thing
to
put
the
case
in
a
nutshell
and
another
thing
to
keep
it
there.
the
complaint
filed
in
the
district
court
was
filed
by
four
individuals
and
nine
unincorporated
associations.
it
is
framed
as
a
class
action
on
behalf
of
all
other
individuals
and
organizations
and
i
read
from
page
8
of
the
appendix,
"all
other
individuals
and
organizations
who
wish
to
exercise
their
right
under
the
first
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
to
engage
in
peaceful
political
protest,
demonstrations,
marches,
rallies,
church
meetings
and
other
forms
of
constitutionally
protected
expression
and
assemblies
without
surveillance
by
defendants
agents
and
without
becoming
the
subject
of
dossiers,
reports
and
files,
defendants'
data
bank
and
intelligence
network."
the
complaint
then
contains
allegations
that
the
army
had
been
conducting
surveillance
of
lawful
and
peaceful
civilian
activity
within
the
united
states
and
that
this
information
is
stored
in
a
computerized
data
bank.
in
exhibit
"a"
attached
to
the
complaint,
they
gave
a
sample
of
the
sort
of
material,
which
has
been
compiled.
this
appears
on
pages
13
to
21
of
the
appendix
and
i
would
like
to
read
a
few
examples
beginning
on
page
14
in
hartford,
connecticut,
march
11,
1968.
approximately
20
persons
picketed
outside
the
u.s.
federal
building.
the
protestors
carried
placards
denouncing
the
war
in
vietnam
and
the
payment
of
income
tax.
the
demonstration
was
sponsored
by
the
voluntown
connecticut
chapter
of
the
new
england
committee
for
nonviolent
action.
and
on
page
16,
san
jose,
california,
an
anti-dow
chemical
company
demonstration
was
held
in
front
of
the
administration
building
at
san
jose
state
college.
a
crowd
of
about
400
to
500
persons
were
present
but
approximately
90%
of
these
were
spectators
or
curious
onlookers.
at
1230
hours,
the
demonstrators
moved
to
the
morris
dailey
auditorium
where
they
were
refused
permission
to
hold
a
rally.
san
jose
state
college
officials
however
permitted
the
protestors
to
use
the
music
building
for
an
afternoon
rally.
the
rally
received
very
little
support
and
attendance
was
light.
now,
i
am
not
going
to
read
others
of
those
items
but
it's
apparent
that
they're
the
kind
of
items
that
constantly
appear
in
the
newspapers,
information
of
very
little
significance
and
not
at
all
repressive
in
its
nature.
there's
also
attached
to
the
complaint
as
an
exhibit
a
copy
of
an
article
by
captain
christopher
h.
pyle
in
which
appeared
in
the
january
1970
issue
of
a
publication
called
the
washington
monthly.
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
publication
of
this
article
was
the
immediate
reason
for
the
bringing
of
this
suit.
there
are
no
allegations
in
the
complaint
that
any
specific
harm
or
injury
has
been
done
to
any
of
the
plaintiffs
either
individual
or
the
unincorporated
associations.
it
was
alleged
that
this
type
of
activity
has
a
chilling
effect
on
the
plaintiffs
and
other
seeking
to
exercise
their
first
amendment
rights.
there
is
no
allegation
in
the
complaint
that
there
was
any
surveillance
of
any
wholly
private
activity.
what
is
charged
is
that
the
members
of
the
military
went
to
public
meetings
and
rather
elaborately
recorded
what
they
saw.
before
proceeding
further,
i
should
call
attention
to
some
background
facts.
there
is
no
rigid
dichotomy
between
military
and
civilian
in
this
country.
both
the
constitution
and
the
statutes
provide
for
the
use
of
the
military
and
domestic
civilian
context,
the
military
is
at
all
times
subject
to
civilian
control
through
the
president
as
commander
in
chief
and
the
secretary
of
defense
and
the
secretaries
and
other
civilian
officers
of
the
three
branches
of
the
armed
forces.
a
high
proportion
of
adult
american
males
including
many
members
of
congress
and
the
courts
have
served
in
the
military
for
a
time.
many
of
them
retained
their
civilian
outlook
as
is
shown
clearly
by
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
filed
here.
over
the
past
20
years,
the
military
has
been
called
on
many
times
to
supplement
civilian
power.
on
some
occasions
to
enforce
decisions
of
the
courts
including
this
court
and
on
many
other
occasions
to
help
to
restore
and
to
maintain
order
in
many
of
our
cities.
this
was
done
in
detroit
in
july
1967.
it
was
done
in
april
1968
here
in
washington
and
in
chicago,
and
in
baltimore,
and
in
other
cities.
i
remember
coming
to
the
calm
of
this
courtroom
on
the
monday
after
the
death
of
martin
luther
king.
there
was
smoke
in
the
air
and
a
soldier
on
every
street
corner
as
i
passed.
the
court
set
but
a
number
of
the
persons
whose
admission
i
was
to
move
that
day
did
not
get
here.
we
can
recall
too
that
the
warrant
commission
reported
that
advanced
intelligence
had
not
been
adequate
for
the
protection
of
the
president
and
recommended
that
greater
steps
be
taken
to
a
compiled
data
about
person
who
might
be
inclined
to
violence.
a
similar
recommendation
was
made
by
the
kerner
commission
in
1968.
today,
we
provide
a
guard
not
only
for
the
president
and
the
vice
president
but
also
for
every
presidential
candidate
and
the
last
with
reason.
if
the
army
is
to
have
the
function
in
helping
to
preserve
order
in
the
civilian
society,
it
must
have
some
intelligence
information.
how
much
is
of
course
an
important
question
but
it
must
have
some.
as
the
court
below
said,
it
cannot
be
expected
that
the
army
should
use
its
force
blindly.
in
the
summer
of
1968,
the
past
was
sad
and
the
future
was
uncertain.
this
was
when
the
army
began
to
expand
its
intelligence
gathering
activities.
from
my
point
of
view,
it
went
too
far
or
perhaps
to
put
it
in
other
way,
there
was
an
absence
of
adequate
civilian
control.
one
of
the
problems
of
an
army
is
that
you
ordinarily
have
to
far
more
people
than
you
have
any
use
for
because
you
have
to
have
enough
people
at
the
right
place
when
the
need
arises.
here,
the
army
had
a
lot
of
people
in
intelligence.
they
spent
more
than
90%
of
their
time
in
investigating
people
who
needed
clearances
for
military
or
civilian
employment.
but
they
had
men
remaining.
and
they
received
directives
that
they
were
to
build
up
intelligence
for
use
in
case
the
military
were
needed
in
connection
with
civilian
disturbances.
so
they
build
up
the
material
we
see
here.
and
they
had
a
computer
and
they
put
all
of
this
on
the
computer.
and
from
the
computer,
they
build
up
a
list
of
the
names
which
appeared
in
the
data
which
the
plaintiffs
call
a
blacklist.
from
my
point
of
view,
it
was
poor
judgment,
and
inappropriate
use
of
military
resources.
as
secretary
of
the
army,
froelke
has
said
and
i
quote
"from
the
vantage
point
of
hindsight,
the
guidance
and
direction
to
the
military
for
a
collection
of
civil
disturbance
information
was
too
often
general
and
oral
rather
than
in
written
form."
or
in
senator
ervin's
words,
"some
people
charged
with
responsibility
in
this
especially
at
the
local
level
got
a
little
bit
too
zealous
in
their
activity."
with
this
summary
statement
of
the
facts
for
the
case
arises
on
the
complaint,
the
motion
to
dismiss
and
the
accompanying
exhibits
and
affidavits
as
included
in
the
appendix,
i
would
like
to
summarize
our
legal
position.
first,
the
complaint
does
not
allege
a
justiciable
controversy.
and
related
to
that,
the
plaintiffs
do
not
have
standing
to
maintain
the
case.
there
is
a
controversy
all
right,
but
it
is
not
a
case
or
controversies
in
the
constitutional
sense.
second,
what
was
done
as
alleged
in
the
complaint
on
why
is
it,
it
may
have
been
did
not
violate
the
constitution
or
any
statute.
third,
if
there
was
anything
done
that
was
legally
wrong
and
the
case
is
justiciable,
it
has
been
stopped.
and
fourth,
in
this
situation,
i
do
not
claim
mootness
in
the
strict
sense
but
the
case
is
not
one
now
if
it
ever
was
in
which
there
is
equity
jurisdiction.
that
is
in
which
it
is
appropriate
for
a
court
of
equity
to
intervene
by
way
of
injunction.
let
me
turn
first
to
the
question
of
justiciability.
as
i
have
already
said,
no
plaintiff
alleges
that
anything
has
been
done
to
injure
him,
the
whole
cause
of
action
rest
on
chills.
i
know
of
no
decision
of
this
court,
which
has
been
based
on
chill
alone.
in
every
case
in
which
chill
has
been
a
factor,
there
has
been
a
criminal
prosecution
either
in
process
or
immediately
threatened
or
there
had
been
governmental
attempts
to
compel
disclosure
of
information
as
a
prerequisite
to
entitlement
to
government
employment
or
benefits.
there
was
an
individual
before
the
court
who
said
that
he
was
injured
in
some
immediate
and
concrete
fashion.
here,
the
complaint
proceeds
only
on
the
broadest
of
generalities.
it
states
on
page
10
of
the
appendix
and
i
quote,
"that
the
purpose
and
effect
of
the
collection,
maintenance,
and
distribution
of
the
information
on
civilian,
political
activity
described
herein
is
to
harass
and
intimidate
plaintiffs
and
others
similarly
situated,
yet
they
do
not
allege
a
single
instance
of
harassment
or
intimidation."
they
do
allege
generally
an
invasion
of
their
privacy,
damage
to
their
reputations
and
an
adverse
effect
on
their
employment.
but
they
cite
no
specific
instance
or
example.
the
dissenting
judge
in
the
court
below
called
these
indefinite
claims
of
highly
visionary
apprehensions.
they
do
not
--
we
submit
of
the
concreteness
and
sufficiency
of
focus
to
make
the
claims
justiciable.
there
is
no
assertion
here
that
the
activity
complained
of
has
cause
direct
injury
to
these
plaintiffs
or
to
others
similarly
situated.
instead,
they
appear
here
as
they
have
said
various
times
in
their
arguments
below
and
then
in
their
briefs,
on
behalf
of
millions
of
people.
but
when
you
appear
on
behalf
of
millions
of
people,
the
case
is
no
longer
concrete
and
specific.
that
is
the
sort
of
thing,
which
is
appropriate
for
consideration
by
the
legislative
branch
or
the
executive
but
does
not
present
a
case
for
decision
by
a
court.
the
case
is
much
like
the
situation
in
united
public
workers
against
mitchell,
a
case
which
they
cite
once
but
skip
over
very
quickly
where
the
court
refused
to
find
a
generalized
claim
as
to
the
validity
of
the
hot
check
to
be
justiciable.
justiciability
is
not
a
mere
technicality.
illusive
as
it
may
be,
it
is
an
expression
of
one
of
the
basic
concepts
on
which
our
constitution
rests
the
separation
of
powers.
the
courts
exercise
judicial
power
under
the
constitution.
this
is
not
the
power
to
decide
all
the
questions
of
law,
which
arise
in
the
course
of
the
administration
of
the
government.
it
is
the
power
to
act
as
a
court,
to
decide
the
concrete
and
specific
issues
which
arise
between
men
and
men
or
between
the
citizen
and
his
government.
when
someone
says,
he
did
this
to
me
and
i
am
hurt.
this
is
not
the
power
to
respond
when
the
complainant
says,
i
don't
like
the
way
the
government
is
acting.
i
am
not
hurt
but
i
might
be
someday
and
i
want
this
stopped.
general
questions
arising
with
respect
to
structure
and
the
administration
of
the
government
are
best
resolved
by
the
two
other
coordinate
branches
established
by
the
constitution.
the
executive
administers
better
than
the
courts
are
equipped
to
administer
and
the
congress
formulates
general
policies
with
more
responsiveness
to
the
democratic
process
than
the
courts
can.
the
courts
with
their
independence
are
better
qualified
to
deal
with
concrete
cases
of
alleged
wrong,
which
directly
affect
the
complainant.
but
the
court
should
not
undertake
to
decide
all
the
questions
which
arise
in
government.
this
case
i
think
is
a
specific
example.
if
the
court
is
to
grant
relief,
it
maybe
of
two
forms,
(a)
it
may
say
that
the
army
is
enjoined
from
conducting
any
and
all
intelligence
operations
involving
civilians
under
any
circumstances.
i
think
that
would
be
wrong.
i
suppose
there
was
a
plot
to
blow
up
an
arsenal
or
sink
a
troop
ship
for
example.
or
suppose
the
army
was
actually
engaged
in
riot
control
operations
in
washington
or
detroit
or
chicago.
the
court
could
hardly
deny
the
army
the
resources
to
protect
this
personnel
or
to
maintain
its
legally
assigned
mission.
if
that
alternative
won't
do,
that
is
absolute
forbidding
to
do
any
civilian
intelligence
work,
then
the
alternative
is
(b)
to
workout
in
detail
what
the
army
may
and
may
not
do
under
variant
circumstances
and
subject
to
change
from
time
to
time
and
from
place
to
place.
that
is
administration
and
the
courts
are
not
equipped
to
carry
on
administration.
we
can
hardly
have
a
situation
where
a
colonel
or
a
captain
confronted
with
an
immediate
problem
in
seattle
or
in
syracuse
would
have
to
say,
well,
i
can't
act.
i
will
have
to
apply
to
the
united
states
district
court
and
the
district
of
columbia
to
get
a
modification
of
the
injunction
in
view
of
the
circumstances
which
confront
me.
managing
things
in
this
way
is
not
judicial
action.
disputes,
which
can
lead
only
to
such
control
of
another
branch
of
government,
are
not
justiciable.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there's
no
suggestion
here
that
anything
has
been
searched
or
seized,
reasonable
or
unreasonable.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
is
no
suggestion
in
this
complaint
that
there
was
electronic
surveillance.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice,
it
did
have
but
as
i
will
point
out,
it
has
stopped
them
on
these
matters.
in
addition
to
the
executive
to
administer
a
very
important
lay
on
this
area,
there's
the
legislative
branch
of
the
government.
many
other
problems
here
are
well
suited
to
the
sort
of
general
policymaking,
which
the
congress
can
do.
if
congress
can
device
appropriate
means
to
regulate
the
military
in
this
area,
it
has
the
power
to
do
so.
the
senate
has
already
held
extensive
hearings
on
this
specific
question
and
a
number
of
bills
have
been
introduced.
and
as
i
shall
indicate
below,
the
executive
has
also
taken
clear
and
specific
action.
but,
second,
if
the
case
is
justiciable,
if
the
plaintiffs
have
adequate
standing
then
we
say,
that
it
is
a
matter
of
law,
the
complaint
does
not
state
a
cause
of
action
on
the
merits.
however
unwise
the
actions
may
have
been
and
in
my
judgment,
they
went
far
beyond
anything
that
was
appropriate
for
the
military
to
do
as
the
department
of
defense
and
the
army
have
recognized,
they
did
not
violate
the
constitution
or
any
provision
of
the
law.
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
that
anything
that
was
done
was
evil
or
malicious.
and
no
allegation
that
the
materials
were
in
fact
misused.
there
is
no
allegation
that
anyone
was
deprived
of
his
freedom
of
speech
which
is
what
the
first
amendment
says.
indeed,
not
much
was
generally
known
about
the
army's
activities
until
the
publication
of
captain
pyle's
article
on
the
filing
of
this
suit.
those
were
in
my
opinion
useful
acts
but
they
were
also
the
immediate
cause
of
whatever
shivering
there
may
be.
they
have
led
to
uninhibited
robust
and
wide-open
debate,
which
i
suppose
is
one
of
the
objectives
of
the
first
amendment
as
this
court
has
said.
they
have
led
the
tighter
civilian
control,
which
is
desired.
they
have
led
to
extensive
consideration
of
the
problem
by
the
congress
which
is
appropriate.
but
there
is
i
submit
no
action
taken
by
the
army
alleged
in
this
complaint,
which
violates
anything
literally
contained
in
the
constitution
and
nothing
done
which
violates
anything
implied
from
the
constitution
as
far
as
this
court's
decision
have
gone.
third,
if
there
was
anything
done
here
which
was
illegal,
it
has
been
stopped.
to
show
this,
i
have
to
go
outside
the
appendix
but
i
believe
that
is
justified
under
this
court's
decisions
for
everything
that
which
i
refer
as
a
matter
of
official
acts.
and
for
support
on
that,
i
would
refer
to
this
court's
decision
last
term
in
the
allard
case.
in
this
case,
the
official
actions
were
numerous
and
clear.
two
of
them
are
included
in
the
appendix
to
our
main
brief.
numerous
others
are
set
out
in
volume
2
of
the
hearings
before
the
senate
committee
on
constitutional
rights.
it
may
seem
odd
that
i
refer
to
these
hearings
in
connection
with
our
case
while
saying
that
the
hearings
themselves
cannot
be
utilized
to
make
this
a
different
case
from
that
which
is
presented
in
this
record.
but
i
believe
the
distinction
is
clear,
the
respondents
want
to
use
the
hearings
as
a
repository
of
evidence
to
establish
facts
which
are
not
alleged
in
their
complaint.
that
is
to
make
this
a
different
case
from
what
it
is
in
the
complaint.
my
reference
to
the
hearings
is
simply
as
a
convenient
place
in
which
the
court
can
find
the
text
of
official
actions,
which
shows
that
the
practices,
which
the
respondents
here
complain
about,
have
been
stopped.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i
think
you
cannot
take
judicial
notice
of
the
evidence
and
testimony,
which
was
presented
before
that
hearing.
i
think
you
can
take
judicial
notice
of
the
official
actions,
which
among
other
places
are
recorded
in
volume
2
of
those
hearings.
as
i
have
said,
the
surveillance
has
been
stopped,
the
computer
banks
and
printouts
have
been
destroyed,
the
index
list
of
names
or
blacklist,
have
been
destroyed.
in
each
case,
one
copy
has
been
retained
for
the
purposes
of
this
litigation.
we
did
not
want
to
restore,
destroy
all
for
fear
of
someone
who
would
say
that
we
had
improperly
interfered
with
the
due
administration
of
justice.
but
that
one
copy
is
in
good
hands
and
will
be
destroyed
as
soon
as
this
litigation
is
terminated
or
the
court
has
given
us
the
authority
to
act.
it's
true
that
the
respondents
say
that
we
cannot
certify
that
every
single
copy
has
been
destroyed
but
the
copies
were
not
numbered.
but
it
is
clear
that
there
has
been
a
bona
fide
effort
to
recall
and
destroy
every
copy
and
orders
have
been
given
against
the
utilization
of
any
copy.
i
do
not
think
that
more
can
be
done
even
under
the
orders
of
a
court.
in
this
circumstance,
we
do
not
say
that
the
case
is
necessarily
moot.
in
some
situations,
past
action
is
sufficient
to
aviate
mootness
even
though
the
action
has
been
stopped.
we
do
say
however
that
the
actions
taken
by
the
army
are
sufficient
to
destroy
equity
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court.
we
sometimes
forget
that
equity
has
a
jurisprudence
of
its
own
and
one
of
the
principles
of
equity
is
that
it
does
not
utilize
the
mighty
remedy
of
injunction
when
the
conduct
complained
of
has
been
stopped
in
the
absence
of
extraordinary
circumstances
such
as
a
substantial
risk
that
the
conduct
will
be
resumed
if
this
court
does
not
intervene.
this
is
essentially
the
basis
of
this
courts
recent
decision
in
the
medical
committee
on
human
rights
case.
here,
there
is
no
such
risk.
i
feel
sure
that
the
court
will
find
that
the
actions
of
the
secretary
of
defense,
of
the
secretary
of
army
and
of
other
defense
officials
are
clear,
vigorous
and
in
good
faith.
it
is
said
that
these
officials
cannot
control
the
army
that
the
army
will
go
ahead
and
watch
civilians
anyway.
if
they
can't
succeed,
i
am
inclined
to
doubt
that
the
district
court
would
be
more
successful.
i
think
that
the
situations
are
different.
today,
from
what
they
have
been
sometimes
in
the
past
that
the
officials
of
the
army
are
alert
and
determined.
it
is
much
better
i
submit
to
leave
the
resolution
of
the
details
of
carrying
out
their
directives
to
the
civilian
army
authorities
than
to
have
the
intervention
of
the
courts.
thus,
if
the
case
is
justiciable,
is
the
actions
of
the
army
in
conducting
surveillance
of
civilians
did
violate
the
constitution
and
the
laws,
i
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
district
court
should
nevertheless
be
affirmed
since
the
actions
of
the
army
have
now
been
terminated,
and
though
the
district
court
did
have
jurisdiction
of
the
case
if
the
records
of
jurisdictional
amount
was
present,
it
is
not
as
of
now
a
case
within
the
principles
of
equity
jurisdiction
where
the
wrong
no
longer
continues,
courts
do
not
ordinarily
issue
an
injunction,
there
should
be
no
injunction
here.
the
decision
below
should
be
reversed
and
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
with
one
exception,
i
do
not
think
that
i
have
misrepresented
the
complaint
here
and
certainly
i
have
not
intended
to
do
so.
that
one
exception
was
in
my
answer
to
the
question
from
mr.
justice
douglas
when
i
said
there
was
no
allegation
about
the
electronic
surveillance.
it
is
true
that
there
is
a
reference
through
the
use
of
photographic
and
electronic
equipment
on
page
9.
in
my
response,
what
i
had
in
mind
was
wiretapping
and
bugging.
there
is
no
specific
allegation
with
respect
to
that.
in
all
of
the
hearings,
there
is
no
evidence
that
such
action
was
taken.
there
is
some
evidence
that
there
was
video
tape,
which
i
suppose
is
electronic
but
is
more
closely
analogous
to
photographic
and
to
what
we
usually
have
in
mind
when
we
say
electronic.
now,
with
respect
to
the
other
items
on
the
meaning
of
the
complaint
and
the
complaint
itself
is
only
seven
pages
long
and
of
course
the
court
will
decide
it
on
the
basis
of
what
it
finds
in
the
complaint.
but
i
would
call
attention
to
the
opinion
of
the
majority
of
the
court
below
on
page
137
of
the
record.
appellants
freely
admit
that
they
complained
of
no
specific
action
of
the
army
against
them,
only
the
existence
and
operation
of
the
intelligence
gathering
and
distributing
system
which
is
confined
to
the
army
and
related
civilian
investigative
agencies.
there
is
no
evidence
of
illegal
or
unlawful
surveillance
activities.
we
are
not
sided
to
any
clandestine
intrusion
by
a
military
agency.
and
then
the
dissenting
judge,
judge
mckinnon
below
