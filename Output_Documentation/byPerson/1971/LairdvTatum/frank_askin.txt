mr.
frank
askin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
senator
ervin
will
take
the
final
10
minutes
of
this
argument
and
will
deal
mainly
with
the
ultra
vires
nature
of
the
military
conduct.
now,
i
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
that
the
only
materials
before
this
court
are
the
plaintiffs'
allegations.
but
with
all
due
respect,
i
believe
the
solicitor
has
again
misstated
and
misrepresented
those
allegations
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
and
it
is
as
the
plaintiffs'
allegations
which
are
here.
not
the
allegations
as
the
defendants
would
like
to
rewrite
them
and
not
some
stated
facts
as
they
might
appear
in
the
light
of
hearsay
assertions
offered
by
defense
counsel
nor
the
solicitor's
efforts
to
justify
the
army's
conduct
with
the
specter
of
smoke
in
the
air
and
soldiers
on
street
corners.
the
sole
question
for
this
court
to
decide
is
whether
the
plaintiffs
were
entitled
to
a
judicial
hearing
whether
they
are
uncontested
allegations
of
unauthorized
and
unconstitutional
conduct
by
the
army
earns
them
the
right
to
their
day
in
court.
it
was
defended
to
move
to
dismiss
this
complaint
who
said
in
effect
construe
plaintiffs'
allegations
most
favorably
give
them
all
the
benefits
of
the
doubt
and
all
the
inferences,
they
said
there
was
still
no
set
of
facts
which
might
be
proved
which
would
entitle
plaintiffs
to
relief
or
even
to
a
hearing
on
the
merits.
the
trial
judge
acted
on
defendants'
advice,
he
decided
to
taking
everything
in
the
consideration
plaintiffs
alleged
they
have
no
right
to
be
in
court.
the
district
court
was
at
error
about
that
and
judges
wilkey
and
tom
in
the
court
of
appeals
were
correct
as
i
believe
a
review
of
the
plaintiffs'
allegations
will
demonstrate.
now,
i
don't
want
to
go
over
in
great
detail
the
factual
setting
of
this
case.
we
are
dealing,
it's
true
with
a
public
issue
that
has
been
discussed
and
reported
upon
very
widely
in
the
two
years
since
plaintiffs
filed
their
complaint
but
i
do
want
to
point
out
the
facts
which
make
these
allegations
justiciable.
now,
plaintiffs
set
forth
a
pervasive
system
of
military
spying
in
data
keeping
on
the
political
activities
of
the
plaintiffs
and
other
law-abiding
americans.
over
a
thousand
army
agents
around
the
country
helping
to
keep
track
of
the
political
assemblages
and
speeches
of
citizens
unassociated
with
the
armed
forces.
citizens
like
plaintiffs
and
members
or
plaintiff
organizations
who
had
done
no
wrong,
people
unassociated
with
the
specter
of
civil
disturbance
which
the
army
belatedly
invoked
to
justify
its
lawless
behavior.
other
information
being
gathered
by
more
clandestine
and
an
undercover
methods
of
operation
and
i
must
point
out
that
the
solicitor
general
is
wrong.
he
has
not
read
plaintiffs'
complaint.
there
are
allegations
of
electronic
surveillance
in
plaintiffs'
complaint.
paragraph
8
says
very
specifically
that
much
of
the
information,
which
is
being
gathered
by
the
army
was
gathered
both
through
anonymous
informants
and
through
the
use
of
photographic
and
electronic
equipment.
so
there
was
--
this
was
not
wholly
public
activity
we
were
talking
about,
there
were
allegations,
uncontested
allegations
that
clandestine
undercover
operations
were
taking
place
in
gathering
this
information
on
the
political
activities
of
the
plaintiffs
and
others
acting
similarly.
mr.
frank
askin
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
frank
askin
well,
i
do
not
think
so
mr.
justice.
again,
i
think
we
have
to
construe
this
complaint
broadly.
we
were
making
allegations
that
they
were
using
a
variety
of
means
both
photographing
people
at
demonstrations
and
i
would
say
that
the
allegation
includes
both
taping
meetings
and
use
of
other
kinds
of
electronic.
mr.
frank
askin
no,
there
is
not
mr.
justice.
we
did
have
witnesses
at
the
hearing
in
the
district
court
who
were
former
army
agents
who
were
prepared
to
testify
about
some
of
the
undercover
activities
they
had
engaged
in
but
they
were
not
permitted
to
go
on
a
stand.
mr.
frank
askin
essentially,
this
is
the
first
amendment
complaint,
that's
correct.
except
in
so
far
as
the
allegations
of
invasion
of
the
right
of
privacy
include
of
course
both
the
first
amendment
and
the
fourth
amendment
and
whatever
other
constitutional
provisions
have
been
invoked
in
its
[voice
overlap].
mr.
frank
askin
essentially,
the
complaint
is
that
the
army
was
invading
the
first
amendment
rights
of
the
plaintiffs.
mr.
frank
askin
that
would
not
be
the
essential
gravamen
of
the
complaint.
mr.
frank
askin
that's
correct
mr.
justice
douglas,
only
the
motion
to
dismiss.
in
plaintiffs'
complaint,
its
exhibits,
its
affidavits
in
support
of
its
motion
for
preliminary
injunction,
which
went
on
at
the
same
time
with
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
heard.
the
complaint
states
that
the
army
was
using
a
teletype
system
similar
to
the
ones
maintained
by
our
new
services,
reporting
the
information
it
was
gathering
to
a
central
intelligence
command
in
fort
holabird
and
out
again
to
military
intelligence
units
all
over
the
country.
data
banks,
large
and
small
at
various
military
installations
and
self-storing
and
often
computerizing
the
data
on
plaintiffs
and
others
for
their
own
use
further
dissemination
of
the
data
to
both
military
and
civilian,
federal
and
state
governmental
units
all
over
the
country.
in
short,
we
put
forth
a
chilling
system
having
nothing
to
do
with
a
military
function.
indeed,
until
it
was
revealed
to
be
part
of
the
operations
of
the
united
states
army,
this
was
a
kind
of
system
which
americans
associate
it
with
some
place
else,
not
with
the
united
states
of
america.
and
the
plaintiffs
who
brought
this
class
suit
challenging
the
authority
of
the
army
to
engage
in
such
a
program
were
of
course
among
the
very
people
most
immediately
and
directly
affected
by
it.
they
were
the
targets
of
surveillance.
every
one
of
the
plaintiff
organizations
and
individuals
had
come
within
the
focus
of
the
army's
surveillance
operation.
all
had
been
the
subject
of
the
army's
intelligence
reports.
the
government's
assertion
that
the
plaintiffs
do
not
allege
that
the
army
spied
on
selected
individuals
or
groups
is,
its
double
talk.
plaintiffs'
allegations
are
as
clear
as
can
be
that
information
about
them
was
collected,
was
transmitted
over
the
army's
teletype
network,
was
fed
into
its
data
banks,
was
then
disseminated
further
around
the
country
indeed
to
military
installations
around
the
world.
plaintiffs
allege
that
this
program
not
only
invaded
their
privacy,
threatened
their
reputations
and
employment
but
also
caused
immediate
and
irremediable
injury
to
their
first
amendment
rights.
both
because
they
themselves
were
forced
to
become
more
circumspect
about
their
speech
and
association
and
more
importantly
because
others
were
deterred
from
associating
with
them
and
pursued
of
political
objectives
and
frightened
the
way
from
membership
in
their
associations
and
organizations.
the
nation
has
since
discovered
in
fact
that
plaintiffs'
complaint
described
only
the
very
tip
of
an
iceberg.
it
was
revealed
in
hearings
before
the
senate
of
the
united
states
and
referred
to
them
really
to
illuminate
our
complaint
and
because
this
case
is
here
on
the
justiciability
[voice
overlap].
mr.
frank
askin
well,
mr.
justice
marshall,
our
allegations
we
believe
are
complete
and
state
clearly
a
justiciable
claim.
we
do
believe
that
in
construing
our
complaint
and
broadly
and
liberally
construing
as
this
court
has
on
many
times
said
it
must
be
done,
indeed,
it's
useful
to
examine
other
information
which
subsequently
was
revealed
about
this
system
as
illuminating
what
in
fact
this
complaint
was
talking
about.
the
complaint
in
accordance
with
the
federal
rules
was
a
short
and
plain
statement.
it
did
not
give
evidence
or
detail
of
the
allegations.
indeed,
what
we're
talking
about
now
is
the
evidence
which
would
later
be
used
to
demonstrate.
in
fact
if
the
plaintiffs
could
prove
their
complaint,
we
do
not
believe
that
that
information
is
essential
to
the
question
of
justiciability
except
in
so
far
as
it
does
illuminate
what
the
plaintiffs
were
complaining
about.
we
did
of
course
--
mr.
frank
askin
we
could
put
witnesses
on
this.
i
am
saying,
if
we
go
back
for
a
hearing,
we
will
have
the
witnesses
to
prove
the
allegations
in
our
complaint
and
some
of
those
witnesses
are
indeed
those
who
did
testify
before
senator
ervin's
committee.
this
is
the
way
in
which
our
complaint
well
in
fact
the
prudence
to
be.
we
have
some
of
those
witnesses
in
court
with
us
that
morning.
mr.
frank
askin
mr.
justice
marshall,
it
was
our
understanding
that
we
were
going
to
have
an
evidentiary
hearing
that
morning.
indeed,
we
had
brought
witnesses
in
from
all
over
the
country
and
they
were
prepared
to
go
on
a
stand.
they
were
not
permitted
to
testify,
but
our
understanding
was
they
would
be
permitted
to
testify.
we
did
not
believe
that
with
our
motion
for
preliminary
injunction
before
the
court
that
it
was
possible
for
the
court
to
really
consider
issuing
a
preliminary
injunction
against
united
states
army
based
on
affidavits.
and
we
were
under
the
impression
that
our
witnesses
would
be
allowed
to
go
on
in
that
morning.
now,
i
will
not
pursue
the
factual
detail.
i
believe
the
information
has
been
stated
in
great
detail
in
our
brief
as
well
as
in
the
two
amicus.
[voice
overlap]
yes,
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
frank
askin
yes,
mr.
justice,
i
believe
he
says
that
we
are
complaining
about
a
generalized
system
which
does
not
focus
concretely
on
these
plaintiffs.
indeed,
this
system
did
focus
concretely
on
the
plaintiffs.
the
plaintiffs
were
watched
by
military.
and
we
might
take
the
situation
of
one
of
our
plaintiffs
mr.
conrad
lynn.
a
military
agent
apparently
went
to
a
meeting
at
a
unitarian
church
in
philadelphia
at
which
mr.
lynn
spoke.
he
filed
a
report
over
the
army's
teletype
system
to
fort
holabird
which
among
other
things
identified
mr.
lynn
as
the
author
of
draft
evasion
literature.
we
alleged
that
that
information
then
goes
into
the
army's
data
bank
at
holabird.
that
information
is
then
picked
up,
sent
out
over
to
the
army's
teletype
system
on
their
weekly
summary
which
is
what
is
attached
as
an
exhibit
to
the
complaint
to
other
military
installations
all
over
the
country
and
then
taken
and
put
in
their
mini
banks
at
these
various
other
military
installations.
so
this
is
something
other
than
plaintiffs
merely
complaining
about
some
generalized
system.
this
is
a
system
which
in
fact
very
intimately
affected
them
and
focused
upon
them
and
that's
where
i
believe
that
the
solicitor
general
has
in
fact
misrepresented
our
allegations
as
indeed
with
the
other
allegations
of,
we
said
clandestine
operations.
in
our
exhibits
to
the
complaint
for
example,
it
is
said
that
among
other
things,
the
military
went
to
the
registrar
at
a
university
to
gather
confidential
information
about
students
and
these
was
one
of
the
ways
in
which
they
were
gathering
information.
but
indeed,
we
were
limited
in
our
knowledge
of
course
as
we
didn't
know
the
details
of
this
system.
we
sought
as
has
been
said
before
only
the
very
tip
of
the
iceberg.
we
did
not
have
that
full
details
as
they
ultimately
emerge
of
course
in
senator
ervin's
committee.
we
could
only
put
forth
in
our
complaint
as
of
the
detail
as
we
in
fact
knew
at
that
time
include
--
in
addition
to
the
broad
outline
to
the
system
as
it
was
functioning.
mr.
frank
askin
of
course
mr.
chief
justice,
that's
not
our
case.
on
the
merits,
it
would
be
a
different
case.
mr.
frank
askin
well,
the
meetings
we're
talking
about
in
the
exhibit
to
the
complaint
republic
meetings
that
suggest
we
made
allegations
that
they
were
also
gathering
information
by
other
kinds
of
clandestine
methods.
if
they
were
only
the
kinds
of
clipping
you
were
saying
but
still
if
they
were
maintaining
data
banks
and
were
still
disseminating
information
with
individuals
and
still
compiling
with
we
refer
to
as
a
blacklist
what
they
call
an
index
list,
i
would
believe
that
there
would
still
be
a
justiciable
controversy.
the
ultimate
result
on
the
merits
might
turn
out
different
but
i
would
say
that
there
would
still
be
a
justiciable
controversy
if
in
fact
this
system
did
focus
on
these
particular
plaintiffs.
that
they
would
have
a
right
claim,
which
would
be
justiciable,
and
then
we'd
have
to
go
back
for
a
hearing
on
the
merits
as
to
whether
or
not
the
army
indeed
could
do
it.
now,
based
on
the
claims
that
we
have
put
forth,
our
contested
allegations,
we
insist
that
there
was
really
no
question
that
plaintiffs
are
entitled
to
a
hearing,
that
the
answer
to
the
justiciability
question
must
be
the
same
one
given
by
this
court
in
a
series
of
celebrate
cases
over
the
past
dozen
years.
in
each
of
which,
government
defendants
argued
that
this
court
should
close
its
eyes
and
close
its
ears
to
serious
violations
of
constitutional
rights.
we
refer
to
baker
versus
carr,
zwickler
versus
koota,
powell
versus
mccormack,
flast
versus
cohen,
and
each
of
those
cases,
this
court
reaffirmed
its
commitment
to
the
principle
of
judicial
review.
and
in
this
case,
even
more
than
any
of
those,
we
suggest
judicial
review
is
absolutely
essential
because
this
case
involves
the
most
serious
of
all
threats
to
democratic
government,
military
intrusion
into
civilian
political
affairs.
now
of
course
the
army
piously
denies
would
block
all
judicial
review
of
such
surveillance
operations.
it
says
it's
only
arguing
that
this
case
is
not
reviewable.
there
is
no
other
form
in
which
this
military
surveillance
operation
may
be
judicially
reviewed.
it
is
now
or
never.
it
is
unlikely
will
ever
be
more
right
that
anyone
else
will
have
ever
have
better
standing
than
these
plaintiffs
to
litigate
this
claim.
so
despite
the
army's
denials,
it
is
asserting
that
the
military
surveillance
operation
is
in
fact
unreviewable.
and
such
a
result
would
make
constitutional
rights
a
nullity.
and
mr.
chief
justice,
as
you
yourself
reminded
us
in
your
dissent
in
bivens
last
year
without
some
affective
sanction
constitutional
protection
against
unlawful
conduct
by
government
officials
would
constitute
little
more
than
rhetoric.
and
if
these
plaintiffs
do
not
assert
a
justiciable
claim,
there
is
no
sanction
whatsoever
against
the
armies
engaging
in
this
kind
of
lawless
conduct.
they
would
then
be
able
--
that
would
mean
that
the
army
can
snoop
at
will
into
people's
lives,
prepare
computerized
dossiers
on
every
men,
women
and
child
in
this
country
free
of
any
judicial
oversight.
mr.
frank
askin
mr.
justice
stewart,
on
standing
[voice
overlap].
i'm
sorry.
mr.
frank
askin
well,
mr.
justice
stewart,
on
the
question
of
standing,
first
of
all,
it
is
unlikely
that
any
particular
plaintiff,
any
particular
individual
is
ever
going
to
find
out
exactly
what
happened
to
him.
mr.
frank
askin
he
would
never
know
mr.
justice.
mr.
frank
askin
yes,
but
-
i'm
sorry.
mr.
frank
askin
but
indeed
it
is
very
unlikely
that
such
a
person
would
ever
know
why
it
was
that
he
lost
that
job.
this
system
operates
in
such
a
way
that
they
don't
come
to
him
and
say,
you're
now
losing
your
job
because
the
military
gathered
information
on
your
political
activities.
somebody
would
say,
you're
not
hired
or
you've
lost
your
job
and
that
will
be
the
end
of
it.
he
would
never
know
the
reason
why.
indeed,
we
think
it's
very
clear
that
our
plaintiffs
have
suffered
the
worst
kind
of
injury.
they
have
indeed
suffered
present
injury
to
their
first
amendment
rights.
and
we
believe
this
court
has
constantly
recognized
that
this
is
the
most
serious
kind
of
constitutional
injury
which
gives
standing.
now,
[voice
overlap].
mr.
frank
askin
alright,
let
me
very
briefly
try
to
conclude
mr.
chief
justice.
we
concede
that
this
is
a
significant
case,
which
will
ultimately
raise
complex
and
difficult
questions
of
constitutional
interpretation.
the
ultimate
question
is
whether
the
army
may
do
what
they've
been
doing
to
the
plaintiffs.
we
insist
they
cannot,
we
insist
we
have
a
justiciable
controversy
here
that
is
right
for
adjudication.
but
that
question
of
what
--
whether
the
army
and
they
do
it
is
not
before
the
court
at
this
time.
this
case
has
reached
this
court
prematurely.
the
questions
presented
by
the
government
on
this
petition
have
long
been
settled.
of
course
plaintiffs'
claims
are
justiciable.
i
would
say
this
issue
was
settled
if
not
in
marbury
than
an
ex
parte
milligan.
and
indeed
to
hold
otherwise,
to
grant
the
army
the
unbridle
discretion,
it
here
seeks
to
interfere
with
civilian,
political
action
would
in
the
words
of
one
recent
law
review
commentary
on
this
case
result
in
the
uncorking
of
the
genie
of
military
command.
and
the
ultimate
result
of
such
a
course,
we
can
only
dimly
imagine
by
viewing
the
tragic
history
of
other
nations
which
failed
to
sharply
draw
the
line
between
military
power
and
civilian
politics.
mr.
frank
askin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
senator
ervin
will
take
the
final
10
minutes
of
this
argument
and
will
deal
mainly
with
the
ultra
vires
nature
of
the
military
conduct.
now,
i
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
that
the
only
materials
before
this
court
are
the
plaintiffs'
allegations.
but
with
all
due
respect,
i
believe
the
solicitor
has
again
misstated
and
misrepresented
those
allegations
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
and
it
is
as
the
plaintiffs'
allegations
which
are
here.
not
the
allegations
as
the
defendants
would
like
to
rewrite
them
and
not
some
stated
facts
as
they
might
appear
in
the
light
of
hearsay
assertions
offered
by
defense
counsel
nor
the
solicitor's
efforts
to
justify
the
army's
conduct
with
the
specter
of
smoke
in
the
air
and
soldiers
on
street
corners.
the
sole
question
for
this
court
to
decide
is
whether
the
plaintiffs
were
entitled
to
a
judicial
hearing
whether
they
are
uncontested
allegations
of
unauthorized
and
unconstitutional
conduct
by
the
army
earns
them
the
right
to
their
day
in
court.
it
was
defended
to
move
to
dismiss
this
complaint
who
said
in
effect
construe
plaintiffs'
allegations
most
favorably
give
them
all
the
benefits
of
the
doubt
and
all
the
inferences,
they
said
there
was
still
no
set
of
facts
which
might
be
proved
which
would
entitle
plaintiffs
to
relief
or
even
to
a
hearing
on
the
merits.
the
trial
judge
acted
on
defendants'
advice,
he
decided
to
taking
everything
in
the
consideration
plaintiffs
alleged
they
have
no
right
to
be
in
court.
the
district
court
was
at
error
about
that
and
judges
wilkey
and
tom
in
the
court
of
appeals
were
correct
as
i
believe
a
review
of
the
plaintiffs'
allegations
will
demonstrate.
now,
i
don't
want
to
go
over
in
great
detail
the
factual
setting
of
this
case.
we
are
dealing,
it's
true
with
a
public
issue
that
has
been
discussed
and
reported
upon
very
widely
in
the
two
years
since
plaintiffs
filed
their
complaint
but
i
do
want
to
point
out
the
facts
which
make
these
allegations
justiciable.
now,
plaintiffs
set
forth
a
pervasive
system
of
military
spying
in
data
keeping
on
the
political
activities
of
the
plaintiffs
and
other
law-abiding
americans.
over
a
thousand
army
agents
around
the
country
helping
to
keep
track
of
the
political
assemblages
and
speeches
of
citizens
unassociated
with
the
armed
forces.
citizens
like
plaintiffs
and
members
or
plaintiff
organizations
who
had
done
no
wrong,
people
unassociated
with
the
specter
of
civil
disturbance
which
the
army
belatedly
invoked
to
justify
its
lawless
behavior.
other
information
being
gathered
by
more
clandestine
and
an
undercover
methods
of
operation
and
i
must
point
out
that
the
solicitor
general
is
wrong.
he
has
not
read
plaintiffs'
complaint.
there
are
allegations
of
electronic
surveillance
in
plaintiffs'
complaint.
paragraph
8
says
very
specifically
that
much
of
the
information,
which
is
being
gathered
by
the
army
was
gathered
both
through
anonymous
informants
and
through
the
use
of
photographic
and
electronic
equipment.
so
there
was
--
this
was
not
wholly
public
activity
we
were
talking
about,
there
were
allegations,
uncontested
allegations
that
clandestine
undercover
operations
were
taking
place
in
gathering
this
information
on
the
political
activities
of
the
plaintiffs
and
others
acting
similarly.
mr.
frank
askin
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
frank
askin
well,
i
do
not
think
so
mr.
justice.
again,
i
think
we
have
to
construe
this
complaint
broadly.
we
were
making
allegations
that
they
were
using
a
variety
of
means
both
photographing
people
at
demonstrations
and
i
would
say
that
the
allegation
includes
both
taping
meetings
and
use
of
other
kinds
of
electronic.
mr.
frank
askin
no,
there
is
not
mr.
justice.
we
did
have
witnesses
at
the
hearing
in
the
district
court
who
were
former
army
agents
who
were
prepared
to
testify
about
some
of
the
undercover
activities
they
had
engaged
in
but
they
were
not
permitted
to
go
on
a
stand.
mr.
frank
askin
essentially,
this
is
the
first
amendment
complaint,
that's
correct.
except
in
so
far
as
the
allegations
of
invasion
of
the
right
of
privacy
include
of
course
both
the
first
amendment
and
the
fourth
amendment
and
whatever
other
constitutional
provisions
have
been
invoked
in
its
[voice
overlap].
mr.
frank
askin
essentially,
the
complaint
is
that
the
army
was
invading
the
first
amendment
rights
of
the
plaintiffs.
mr.
frank
askin
that
would
not
be
the
essential
gravamen
of
the
complaint.
mr.
frank
askin
that's
correct
mr.
justice
douglas,
only
the
motion
to
dismiss.
in
plaintiffs'
complaint,
its
exhibits,
its
affidavits
in
support
of
its
motion
for
preliminary
injunction,
which
went
on
at
the
same
time
with
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
heard.
the
complaint
states
that
the
army
was
using
a
teletype
system
similar
to
the
ones
maintained
by
our
new
services,
reporting
the
information
it
was
gathering
to
a
central
intelligence
command
in
fort
holabird
and
out
again
to
military
intelligence
units
all
over
the
country.
data
banks,
large
and
small
at
various
military
installations
and
self-storing
and
often
computerizing
the
data
on
plaintiffs
and
others
for
their
own
use
further
dissemination
of
the
data
to
both
military
and
civilian,
federal
and
state
governmental
units
all
over
the
country.
in
short,
we
put
forth
a
chilling
system
having
nothing
to
do
with
a
military
function.
indeed,
until
it
was
revealed
to
be
part
of
the
operations
of
the
united
states
army,
this
was
a
kind
of
system
which
americans
associate
it
with
some
place
else,
not
with
the
united
states
of
america.
and
the
plaintiffs
who
brought
this
class
suit
challenging
the
authority
of
the
army
to
engage
in
such
a
program
were
of
course
among
the
very
people
most
immediately
and
directly
affected
by
it.
they
were
the
targets
of
surveillance.
every
one
of
the
plaintiff
organizations
and
individuals
had
come
within
the
focus
of
the
army's
surveillance
operation.
all
had
been
the
subject
of
the
army's
intelligence
reports.
the
government's
assertion
that
the
plaintiffs
do
not
allege
that
the
army
spied
on
selected
individuals
or
groups
is,
its
double
talk.
plaintiffs'
allegations
are
as
clear
as
can
be
that
information
about
them
was
collected,
was
transmitted
over
the
army's
teletype
network,
was
fed
into
its
data
banks,
was
then
disseminated
further
around
the
country
indeed
to
military
installations
around
the
world.
plaintiffs
allege
that
this
program
not
only
invaded
their
privacy,
threatened
their
reputations
and
employment
but
also
caused
immediate
and
irremediable
injury
to
their
first
amendment
rights.
both
because
they
themselves
were
forced
to
become
more
circumspect
about
their
speech
and
association
and
more
importantly
because
others
were
deterred
from
associating
with
them
and
pursued
of
political
objectives
and
frightened
the
way
from
membership
in
their
associations
and
organizations.
the
nation
has
since
discovered
in
fact
that
plaintiffs'
complaint
described
only
the
very
tip
of
an
iceberg.
it
was
revealed
in
hearings
before
the
senate
of
the
united
states
and
referred
to
them
really
to
illuminate
our
complaint
and
because
this
case
is
here
on
the
justiciability
[voice
overlap].
mr.
frank
askin
well,
mr.
justice
marshall,
our
allegations
we
believe
are
complete
and
state
clearly
a
justiciable
claim.
we
do
believe
that
in
construing
our
complaint
and
broadly
and
liberally
construing
as
this
court
has
on
many
times
said
it
must
be
done,
indeed,
it's
useful
to
examine
other
information
which
subsequently
was
revealed
about
this
system
as
illuminating
what
in
fact
this
complaint
was
talking
about.
the
complaint
in
accordance
with
the
federal
rules
was
a
short
and
plain
statement.
it
did
not
give
evidence
or
detail
of
the
allegations.
indeed,
what
we're
talking
about
now
is
the
evidence
which
would
later
be
used
to
demonstrate.
in
fact
if
the
plaintiffs
could
prove
their
complaint,
we
do
not
believe
that
that
information
is
essential
to
the
question
of
justiciability
except
in
so
far
as
it
does
illuminate
what
the
plaintiffs
were
complaining
about.
we
did
of
course
--
mr.
frank
askin
we
could
put
witnesses
on
this.
i
am
saying,
if
we
go
back
for
a
hearing,
we
will
have
the
witnesses
to
prove
the
allegations
in
our
complaint
and
some
of
those
witnesses
are
indeed
those
who
did
testify
before
senator
ervin's
committee.
this
is
the
way
in
which
our
complaint
well
in
fact
the
prudence
to
be.
we
have
some
of
those
witnesses
in
court
with
us
that
morning.
mr.
frank
askin
mr.
justice
marshall,
it
was
our
understanding
that
we
were
going
to
have
an
evidentiary
hearing
that
morning.
indeed,
we
had
brought
witnesses
in
from
all
over
the
country
and
they
were
prepared
to
go
on
a
stand.
they
were
not
permitted
to
testify,
but
our
understanding
was
they
would
be
permitted
to
testify.
we
did
not
believe
that
with
our
motion
for
preliminary
injunction
before
the
court
that
it
was
possible
for
the
court
to
really
consider
issuing
a
preliminary
injunction
against
united
states
army
based
on
affidavits.
and
we
were
under
the
impression
that
our
witnesses
would
be
allowed
to
go
on
in
that
morning.
now,
i
will
not
pursue
the
factual
detail.
i
believe
the
information
has
been
stated
in
great
detail
in
our
brief
as
well
as
in
the
two
amicus.
[voice
overlap]
yes,
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
frank
askin
yes,
mr.
justice,
i
believe
he
says
that
we
are
complaining
about
a
generalized
system
which
does
not
focus
concretely
on
these
plaintiffs.
indeed,
this
system
did
focus
concretely
on
the
plaintiffs.
the
plaintiffs
were
watched
by
military.
and
we
might
take
the
situation
of
one
of
our
plaintiffs
mr.
conrad
lynn.
a
military
agent
apparently
went
to
a
meeting
at
a
unitarian
church
in
philadelphia
at
which
mr.
lynn
spoke.
he
filed
a
report
over
the
army's
teletype
system
to
fort
holabird
which
among
other
things
identified
mr.
lynn
as
the
author
of
draft
evasion
literature.
we
alleged
that
that
information
then
goes
into
the
army's
data
bank
at
holabird.
that
information
is
then
picked
up,
sent
out
over
to
the
army's
teletype
system
on
their
weekly
summary
which
is
what
is
attached
as
an
exhibit
to
the
complaint
to
other
military
installations
all
over
the
country
and
then
taken
and
put
in
their
mini
banks
at
these
various
other
military
installations.
so
this
is
something
other
than
plaintiffs
merely
complaining
about
some
generalized
system.
this
is
a
system
which
in
fact
very
intimately
affected
them
and
focused
upon
them
and
that's
where
i
believe
that
the
solicitor
general
has
in
fact
misrepresented
our
allegations
as
indeed
with
the
other
allegations
of,
we
said
clandestine
operations.
in
our
exhibits
to
the
complaint
for
example,
it
is
said
that
among
other
things,
the
military
went
to
the
registrar
at
a
university
to
gather
confidential
information
about
students
and
these
was
one
of
the
ways
in
which
they
were
gathering
information.
but
indeed,
we
were
limited
in
our
knowledge
of
course
as
we
didn't
know
the
details
of
this
system.
we
sought
as
has
been
said
before
only
the
very
tip
of
the
iceberg.
we
did
not
have
that
full
details
as
they
ultimately
emerge
of
course
in
senator
ervin's
committee.
we
could
only
put
forth
in
our
complaint
as
of
the
detail
as
we
in
fact
knew
at
that
time
include
--
in
addition
to
the
broad
outline
to
the
system
as
it
was
functioning.
mr.
frank
askin
of
course
mr.
chief
justice,
that's
not
our
case.
on
the
merits,
it
would
be
a
different
case.
mr.
frank
askin
well,
the
meetings
we're
talking
about
in
the
exhibit
to
the
complaint
republic
meetings
that
suggest
we
made
allegations
that
they
were
also
gathering
information
by
other
kinds
of
clandestine
methods.
if
they
were
only
the
kinds
of
clipping
you
were
saying
but
still
if
they
were
maintaining
data
banks
and
were
still
disseminating
information
with
individuals
and
still
compiling
with
we
refer
to
as
a
blacklist
what
they
call
an
index
list,
i
would
believe
that
there
would
still
be
a
justiciable
controversy.
the
ultimate
result
on
the
merits
might
turn
out
different
but
i
would
say
that
there
would
still
be
a
justiciable
controversy
if
in
fact
this
system
did
focus
on
these
particular
plaintiffs.
that
they
would
have
a
right
claim,
which
would
be
justiciable,
and
then
we'd
have
to
go
back
for
a
hearing
on
the
merits
as
to
whether
or
not
the
army
indeed
could
do
it.
now,
based
on
the
claims
that
we
have
put
forth,
our
contested
allegations,
we
insist
that
there
was
really
no
question
that
plaintiffs
are
entitled
to
a
hearing,
that
the
answer
to
the
justiciability
question
must
be
the
same
one
given
by
this
court
in
a
series
of
celebrate
cases
over
the
past
dozen
years.
in
each
of
which,
government
defendants
argued
that
this
court
should
close
its
eyes
and
close
its
ears
to
serious
violations
of
constitutional
rights.
we
refer
to
baker
versus
carr,
zwickler
versus
koota,
powell
versus
mccormack,
flast
versus
cohen,
and
each
of
those
cases,
this
court
reaffirmed
its
commitment
to
the
principle
of
judicial
review.
and
in
this
case,
even
more
than
any
of
those,
we
suggest
judicial
review
is
absolutely
essential
because
this
case
involves
the
most
serious
of
all
threats
to
democratic
government,
military
intrusion
into
civilian
political
affairs.
now
of
course
the
army
piously
denies
would
block
all
judicial
review
of
such
surveillance
operations.
it
says
it's
only
arguing
that
this
case
is
not
reviewable.
there
is
no
other
form
in
which
this
military
surveillance
operation
may
be
judicially
reviewed.
it
is
now
or
never.
it
is
unlikely
will
ever
be
more
right
that
anyone
else
will
have
ever
have
better
standing
than
these
plaintiffs
to
litigate
this
claim.
so
despite
the
army's
denials,
it
is
asserting
that
the
military
surveillance
operation
is
in
fact
unreviewable.
and
such
a
result
would
make
constitutional
rights
a
nullity.
and
mr.
chief
justice,
as
you
yourself
reminded
us
in
your
dissent
in
bivens
last
year
without
some
affective
sanction
constitutional
protection
against
unlawful
conduct
by
government
officials
would
constitute
little
more
than
rhetoric.
and
if
these
plaintiffs
do
not
assert
a
justiciable
claim,
there
is
no
sanction
whatsoever
against
the
armies
engaging
in
this
kind
of
lawless
conduct.
they
would
then
be
able
--
that
would
mean
that
the
army
can
snoop

mr.
frank
askin
mr.
justice
stewart,
on
standing
[voice

i'm
sorry.
mr.
frank
askin
well,
mr.
justice
stewart,
on
the
question
of
standing,
first
of
all,
it
is
unlikely
that
any
particular
plaintiff,
any
particular
individual
is
ever
going
to
find
out
exactly
what
happened
to
him.
mr.
frank
askin
he
would
never
know
mr.
justice.
mr.
frank
askin
yes,
but
-
i'm
sorry.
mr.
frank
askin
but
indeed
it
is
very
unlikely
that
such
a
person
would
ever
know
why
it
was
that
he
lost
that
job.
this
system
operates
in
such
a
way
that
they
don't
come
to
him
and
say,
you're
now
losing
your
job
because
the
military
gathered
information
on
your
political
activities.
somebody
would
say,
you're
not
hired
or
you've
lost
your
job
and
that
will
be
the
end
of
it.
he
would
never
know
the
reason
why.
indeed,
we
think
it's
very
clear
that
our
plaintiffs
have
suffered
the
worst
kind
of
injury.
they
have
indeed
suffered
present
injury
to
their
first
amendment
rights.
and
we
believe
this
court
has
constantly
recognized
that
this
is
the
most
serious
kind
of
constitutional
injury
which
gives
standing.
now,
[voice
overlap].
mr.
frank
askin
alright,
let
me
very
briefly
try
to
conclude
mr.
chief
justice.
we
concede
that
this
is
a
significant
case,
which
will
ultimately
raise
complex
and
difficult
questions
of
constitutional
interpretation.
the
ultimate
question
is
whether
the
army
may
do
what
they've
been
doing
to
the
plaintiffs.
we
insist
they
cannot,
we
insist
we
have
a
justiciable
controversy
here
that
is
right
for
adjudication.
but
that
question
of
what
--
whether
the
army
and
they
do
it
is
not
before
the
court
at
this
time.
this
case
has
reached
this
court
prematurely.
the
questions
presented
by
the
government
on
this
petition
have
long
been
settled.
of
course
plaintiffs'
claims
are
justiciable.
i
would
say
this
issue
was
settled
if
not
in
marbury
than
an
ex
parte
milligan.
and
indeed
to
hold
otherwise,
to
grant
the
army
the
unbridle
discretion,
it
here
seeks
to
interfere
with
civilian,
political
action
would
in
the
words
of
one
recent
law
review
commentary
on
this
case
result
in
the
uncorking
of
the
genie
of
military
command.
and
the
ultimate
result
of
such
a
course,
we
can
only
dimly
imagine
by
viewing
the
tragic
history
of
other
nations
which
failed
to
sharply
draw
the
line
between
military
power
and
civilian
politics.
