mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
appellant
in
this
case
louis
colten
was
convicted
under
the
kentucky
disorderly
conduct
statute,
kentucky's
revised
statutes,
437-016.
he
was
convicted
under
provision
(f)
of
that
statute,
which
can
be
found
on
page
2
of
the
brief.
the
provision
under
which
he
was
convicted,
would
read
as
follows.
a
person
is
guilty
of
disorderly
conduct
if,
with
intent
to
cause
public
inconvenience,
annoyance
or
alarm,
or
recklessly
creating
a
risk
thereof,
he
congregates
with
other
persons
in
a
public
place
and
refuses
to
comply
with
a
lawful
order
of
the
police
to
disperse.
two
issues
are
presented
in
this
case
with
respect
to
that
provision.
one,
whether
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
construction
of
that
provision
has
rendered
it
unconstitutional
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
other,
whether
the
application
of
that
statute
to
the
facts
in
this
case,
is
unconstitutional
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
proceeding
under
which
mr.
colten
was
convicted,
under
which
he
was
convicted
in
the
judgment
from
which
this
appeal
is
being
taken
involves
a
two
step
trial
procedure.
in
kentucky,
misdemeanors
carrying
potential
penalty
of
up
to
12
months
imprisonment
and
up
to
$500
fine,
can
be
tried
in
an
inferior
criminal
court
as
was
mr.
colten
tried
in
an
inferior
criminal
court
in
this
situation,
the
quarterly
court
of
fayette
county.
the
only
way
an
appeal
can
be
taken
from
that
inferior
court
is
by
filing
for
a
trial
de
novo
in
the
court
of
general
jurisdiction,
the
circuit
court.
this
is
what
mr.
colten
did
in
order
to
frame
his
constitutional
challenges
when
he
was
convicted
in
the
inferior
court.
when
he
was
tried
the
second
time,
he
was
again
convicted,
but
this
time
the
penalty
imposed
upon
him
was
increased.
that
aspect
of
the
case
raises
the
third
issue
presented
before
this
court.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
in
his
case,
it
was
a
five-fold
increase
in
a
monetary
penalty
and
increase
from
a
$10
fine
to
a
$50
fine.
in
other
case,
pending
before
this
court
on
a
petition
for
certiorari
cases,
bell
v.
commonwealth,
number
70-5304,
involves
a
much
more
dramatic
increase
in
penalty.
in
that
case,
the
man
had
been
fined
and
quarterly
court
$1
plus
cost,
cost
paying
a
statutory
requirement
in
kentucky.
when
he
was
retried
in
the
circuit
court,
he
will
receive
the
penalty
of
$500
fine
and
5
months
28
days
imprisonment.
that
case
also
was
brought
under
this
disorderly
conduct
statute.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
in
the
particular
court
in
which
mr.
colten
and
mr.
bell
were
tried,
the
court
commissioner
is
a
lawyer.
the
situation
with
respect
to
the
quarterly
courts,
is
that
they
are
adjuncts
of
the
county
court.
the
county
court
is
for
the
most
part
an
administrative
position.
the
county
judge
is
in
essence
the
county
administrator
in
kentucky.
the
vast
majority
of
county
judges
in
kentucky
are
not
lawyers.
in
a
case
of
fayette
county,
he
happens
to
be
a
lawyer
and
in
the
case
of
fayette
county,
the
quarterly
court
commissioner
who
is
appointed
is
a
lawyer.
it's
my
understanding
though
that
frequently
the
county
judges
were
not
lawyers,
try
these
cases
themselves
and
that
where
commissioners
are
appointed
sometimes
they
are
not
lawyers.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
fayette
county
is
the
county
in
which
lexington
is
situated.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
no,
they
are
not.
there
is
no
provision
for
transcript.
my
conversations
on
that
matter
with
the
prosecuting
attorney
in
fayette
county,
is
that
the
defendant
can
secure
a
transcript
by
bringing
his
own
court
reporter
and
then
it's
a
matter
of
the
court
reporter's
certification
being
acceptable
to
any
court
which
is
later
to
review
the
matter.
i
would
point
out
on
that
account
that
the
appeal
from
the
quarterly
court
is
automatic
--
not
automatic
but
it's
a
matter
of
right.
one
does
not
have
to
apply
for
commission
to
appeal,
one
does
not
have
to
show
grounds
for
appeal.
one
can
appeal
as
a
matter
of
right
and
i
think
that
probably
the
reason
for
the
rule
being
that
way
is
a
recognition
that
the
nature
of
the
quarterly
court
proceeding
is
such,
the
nature
and
structure
of
the
quarterly
court
is
such
that
it
is
readily
presumed
that
errors
can
and
are
frequently
committed
with
respect
to
constitutional
rights
and
even
statutory
rights
and
indeed
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
below,
the
court
recognized
specifically
that
the
nature
of
these
inferior
court
trials
are
such,
that
all
of
the
constitutional
rights
of
a
defendant
are
normally
not
protected.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
the
rule
of
the
court
does
permit
that.
i
would
point
out
though
that
to
say
to
a
defendant,
all
you
have
to
do
is
plead
guilty
is
to
say
to
a
defendant,
all
you
have
to
do
is
waive
your
fifth
amendment
rights,
that
there
are
decisions
from
this
court
i
believe
with
respect
to
the
plead
bargaining
cases
suggesting
that
it
is
not
proper
for
a
court
to
accept
a
plea
of
guilty
unless
the
court
is
satisfied
that
indeed
the
defendant
is
meaningfully
admitting
his
guilt.
that
where
the
defendant
feels
that
he
is
not
guilty,
it
is
improper
for
a
court
to
impose
any
form
of
pressure
on
the
defendant
to
come
before
a
court
and
falsely
swear,
falsely
say
in
open
court,
i
am
guilty.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
no,
your
honor.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
he
had
a
lawyer.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
he
had
a
lawyer
at
the
quarterly
court.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart,
he
was
a
college
student.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
locally
at
the
university
of
kentucky
and
counsel
was
provided
for
him
--
voluntary
counsel
through
the
american
civil
liberties
union.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
my
understanding
is
that
there
were
few
witnesses
at
quarterly
court,
i
was
counsel
in
the
trial
de
novo
at
circuit
court
that
there
was
one
witness,
it's
my
understanding
--
my
recollection
my
co-counsel
telling
me
that
appeared
at
the
quarterly
court
that
did
not
appear,
police
officer
who
testified
at
the
quarterly
court
who
did
not
testify
at
the
circuit
court.
we
did
not
choose
to
call
that
witness
in
the
circuit
court.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
the
equivalent
of
approximately
one
day.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
i
don't
think
i
can
answer
that
question
with
sufficient
confidence.
i
have
sat
in
on
many
quarterly
court
trials.
i
was
present
at
the
trial
of
mr.
bell's
case
in
quarterly
court,
the
matter
that's
on
petition
for
certiorari,
that
case
took
all
about
ten
minutes.
most
trials
in
quarterly
court
run
somewhere
between
10
and
20
minutes.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
you
can,
the
kentucky
constitution
provides
for
a
six
member
jury.
the
jury
is
paid
by
the
losing
party.
it's
my
understanding
that
in
criminal
proceedings
therefore
where
the
defendant
is
found
guilty,
the
jury
costs
are
appended
to
the
other
costs
charged
to
him
and
for
that
reason
it's
my
understanding
that
when
one
seeks
a
jury
trial
in
the
quarterly
court,
that
person
has
to
post
a
bond
or
some
other
form
of
security
for
the
payment
of
the
jury
fee
which
works
out
to
be
i
believe
$30.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
no
your
honor,
he
did
not
ask
for
a
jury
trial
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
my
client
is
a
young
man
who
at
that
time
had
quite
long
hair,
rather
long
mustache
and
as
the
trial
judge
in
circuit
court
remarked
in
words
or
fact,
he
dresses
in
the
sort
of
way
that's
different
from
the
general
way
which
we
are
used
to
seeing
people
dress.
the
nature
of
the
typical
juror's
attitude
in
fayette
county
is
such
that
counsel
felt
that
we
could
get
a
fairer
trial
from
the
court
in
this
situation
than
from
a
jury.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
no,
and
i
might
point
out
that
the
way
the
procedure
is
set
up,
when
you
go
to
quarterly
court,
you
have
to
affirmatively
request
a
jury
trial.
in
circuit
court,
the
jury
trial
is
the
norm
and
one
specifically
waives.
in
fact,
there
are
a
number
of
situations
including
the
bell
case,
the
companion
case
in
which
the
court
will
reject
the
waiver
of
jury
trial.
bell
was
tried
by,
just
the
judge
in
quarterly
court.
he
was
tried
by
a
jury
because
the
court
and
prosecutor
both
insisted
on
a
jury
trial
when
it
came
for
the
trial
de
novo.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
no,
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
bell
case
rose
about
60
days
later
as
in
relation
to
a
campus
demonstration
connected
with
the
cambodian
incidence.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
it
was
at
the
university
of
kentucky.
it
involved
a
crowd
of
students
being
dispersed
by
the
state
police.
some
of
the
same
police
officers
were
involved
in
the
--
no,
bell
was
arrested
when
a
curfew
was
imposed
on
the
campus
and
a
group
approached
the
state
police
and
said
they
wanted
to
go
on
their
campus
and
in
effect
submitted
themselves
to
arrest
as
a
form
of
protest
against
what
they
thought
to
be,
what
they
contend
in
court
to
be,
and
unlawfully
imposed
curfew.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
no,
it
did
not.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
the
jury
does
determine
the
sentence
as
well
as
guilt
in
kentucky,
within
the
statutory
limits.
the
only
control
that
the
court
has
on
the
sentence
when
there
is
a
jury
trial
is
through
the
probationary
procedures.
in
the
case
of
the
bell
case
because
the
matter
is
still
being
litigated,
the
court
has
not
reached
the
point
of
having
the
probationary
issue
addressed
to
it.
the
facts
out
of
which
surrounding
the
arrest
of
mr.
colten
are,
i
think
of
some
considerable
significance.
in
the
background,
we
have
initially
a
meeting
of
mr.
colten
and
the
officer
who
eventually
took
him
into
custody,
tuper(ph)
harlow
at
the
airport
terminal
area.
shortly
before
mrs.
nixon's
plane
departed.
at
that
time
officer
harlow
testifies
that
mr.
colten
came
up
to
him
and
said
to
him,
we
are
going
to
have
a
party
out
here,
and
officer
harlow
replied
in
effect
not
over
here,
you
know.
he
said,
they
then
went
off
and
conducted
a
scene
somewhere
nearby.
in
this
connection,
he
testified
on
cross
examination
to
the
effect
that
he
was
offended
by
mr.
colten's
appearance
that
in
substance,
he
testified
the
fact
that
he
thinks
it's
quite
improper
for
a
group
of
people
looking
like
colten
looks
to
be
hanging
around
in
airport
entrance
where
in
his
words
an
awfully
a
lot
of
important
people
are
going
in
and
out.
he
did
not
make
any
arrest
at
that
time.
shortly
thereafter,
a
group
that
was
at
the
airport
was
departing
along
the
access
road.
one
of
those
departing
was
driving
an
automobile
with
an
out-of-state
license
plate
that
had
expired.
trooper
miller
pulled
the
car
that
was
driving
with
the
out-of-date
license
off
to
the
side
of
the
road,
pulled
completely
off
to
the
side
of
the
access
road.
trooper
miller
pulled
in
behind
that
car
and
mr.
colten
who
knew
the
driver
of
the
car
that
was
pulled
over
behind
the
trooper's
car.
he
got
out
of
the
car,
he
learned
that
the
car
that
had
been
pulled
was
to
be
toed
away.
there
were
total
of
five
passengers
in
that
car.
mr.
colten
had
some
room
in
his
own
automobile
and
at
least
one
of
the
police
officers
conformed
the
testimony
of
the
defense
witnesses
that
mr.
colten
said
when
told
to
leave
by
police
officers
that
he
wanted
to
give
a
ride
back
to
lexington
to
these
people.
the
officer
who
apprehended
mr.
colten
admitted
that
mr.
colten
indeed
may
have
said
that.
any
event
--
some
other
cars
pulled
over
to
the
side
and
there
was
a
number
of
people
variously
estimated
from
about
12
to
18
throughout
the
area
where
the
cars
were
pulled
over.
one
officer
testified
that
there
was
at
one
point
at
least,
15
persons
in
the
access
road.
the
captain
who
was
in-charge
of
the
detail
out
at
the
airport
pulled
up
in
the
access
road
blocking
that
road,
got
out
of
his
vehicle
and
told
these
people
to
leave,
get
in
your
cars
and
leave.
other
police
officers
stopped
and
similarly
got
out
of
their
cars,
went
over
to
the
crowd
and
said,
leave,
get
in
your
cars
and
leave,
you
have
no
business
here.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
no,
the
evidence
only
show
that
they
were
people
who
are
out
at
the
airport.
one
of
the
individuals
who
testified
for
the
defense,
for
example,
had
not
known
mr.
colten
until
he
accepted
an
offer
for
a
ride
in
mr.
colten's
car,
a
ride
back
to
lexington.
so
it
appeared
that
at
least
some
of
the
people
who
pulled
off
to
the
side
were
there
at
the
site,
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
--
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
no
it
was
not,
your
honor.
there
is
--
at
least
the
record
does
not
indicate
that
clearly,
one
way
or
the
other,
many
things
--
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
it's
not
clear
in
the
record
mr.
mendez
and
mr.
colten
knew
each
other
but
where
mr.
mendez
is,
it's
not
--
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
that's
not
revealed
in
the
record.
now,
at
a
point
in
which
mr.
colten
was
clearly
off
of
the
road,
on
the
shoulder.
officer
harlow
came
up
to
mr.
colten
and
told
him
to
leave.
colten
according
to
officer
harlow
said,
i
want
to
stay
around
and
see
what's
happening.
on
the
constitutional
issues,
i
think
we
are
perfectly
willing
to
argue
the
case
strictly
in
terms
of
mr.
colten
having
said
nothing
more
than
i
want
to
stand
around
and
see
what's
happening.
officer
harlow
told
mr.
colten
to
leave
several
times
and
then
grab
mr.
colten
and
started
to
lead
him
toward
the
road.
at
that
point,
a
group
of
other
police
officers
came
over,
and
record
is
fairly
clear
that
mr.
colten
was
at
that
point
roughed
up.
i
point
that
out
not
in
any
effort
to
win
any
sympathy
for
mr.
colten,
after
all
if
he
has
any
course
for
complaint
about
that,
he
has
a
civil
action.
but
i
think
it
is
of
significance
in
this
case,
because
one
of
our
contentions
is
that
the
interpretive
gloss
placed
upon
the
statute
by
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals,
renders
it
excessively
vague
and
over
broad.
and
this
court
has
frequently
pointed
out,
that
one
of
the
deficiencies,
constitutional
deficiencies
have
penal
statues
which
are
excessively
broad
and
over
vague,
is
that
they
provide
an
invitation
to
abuse
by
law
enforcement
authorities.
and
i
think
there
is
good
evidence
to
suggest
that,
in
fact
that
is
what
happened
here.
that
when
we
look
at
the
situation
realistically,
what
we
have
here
is
a
group
of
people
who
cause
these
police
officers
to
have
a
long
hard
day
of
duty.
this
was
a
group
that
as
the
record
shows
had
been
following
mrs.
nixon
around.
they
were
clearly
not
sympathetic
to
mrs.
nixon's
presence.
the
police
officers
had
just
finished
a
long
hard
day
of
duty.
there
are
some
indications
in
the
record
that
trial
court
gave
some
recognition
that
these
police
officers
may
not
have
felt
too
kindly
to
these
individuals.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
well,
both
the
police
officers
and
these
individuals
who
had
been
out
at
the
airport.
they
had
mrs.
nixon
had
a
tour
of
the
lexington
area,
and
this
group
had
been
going
from
place
to
place
demonstrating
in
favor
of
their
gubernatorial
candidate.
the
gubernatorial
candidate,
being
in
effect
a
protest
candidate
and
they
explained
that
the
reason,
they
were
demonstrating
for
the
gubernatorial
candidate
was
to
overtly
ignore
mrs.
nixon's
presence.
now,
the
police
officers
after
this
long
hard
day,
are
confronted
with
the
situation
which
a
fellow
officer
is
issuing
a
citation.
a
group
of
these
people
are
standing
around
and
they
come
over
and
they
do,
what
i
think
our
experience
tells
us
is
a
normal
police
practice.
it
doesn't
necessarily
mean
it's
a
constitutionally
valid
police
practice.
they
come
up
to
the
crowd,
they
don't
say
get
off
the
road,
they
don't
say
give
the
officers
some
clearance,
the
particular
officer
was
issuing
the
citation,
did
not
complain
about
mr.
colten
to
the
captain,
who
came
over
to
him,
to
ask
him
what
was
going
on.
he
did
not
seek
to
arrest
mr.
colten,
he
did
not
ask
anyone
to
arrest
mr.
colten,
he
in
fact
issued
his
citation
without
any
serious
problems.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
he
testified
that
he
went
back
to
his
own
patrol
car,
closed
the
window
and
proceeded
to
issue
the
citation.
there
was
some
suggestion
made
by
him,
that
he
had
to
do
this
because
of
mr.
colten,
nevertheless,
when
his
own
captain
came
to
him.
after
he
went
to
his
patrol
car
and
asked
them
what's
going
on?
the
captain's
testimony
shows
nothing
nor
does
trooper
miller's
testimony,
show
anything
to
the
effect
that
trooper
miller
said,
that
man
is
interfering
with
me.
i
haven't
been
--
i'm
having
a
problem
issuing
the
citation.
the
fact
is
that
mr.
colten
was
convicted
not
for
interfering
with
the
police
officer,
he
was
convicted
for
failure
to
disperse
upon
“lawful”
order
of
the
police.
so
we
have
a
situation
which
the
police
say,
disperse.
and
this
individual
declines
to
disperse.
he's
thereupon
arrested.
i
think
that
in
most
respects,
this
case
is
really
very
close
to
recent
decisions
of
this
court
in
cases
such
as,
papachristou,
and
i
believe
it's
the
godin
case.
the
basic
question
is,
what's
the
quality
of
life
under
our
constitution?
to
what
extent
is
the
presumption
under
our
constitution
a
presumption
of
lawfulness?
to
what
extent
is
the
presumption
under
our
constitution
and
authoritarian
presumption?
does
the
citizen
have
to
jump,
because
the
police
officer
addresses
him
and
says,
leave,
or
is
the
burden
upon
the
police
and
the
prosecutor
to
show
that
now
you
are
ordered
to
leave,
because
there
was
a
compelling
need
to
order
you
to
leave.
in
this
situation,
i
don't
think
the
evidence
shows
any
such
compelling
need
to
leave.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
yes,
when
there
is
such
a
constitutional
right
to
be
balanced
against
the
constitutional
rights
of
assembling
an
expression,
those
rights
have
to
be
balanced.
a
police
officer
performing
his
duties
though
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
not
think
has
a
claim
to
a
right
of
privacy.
he
is
a
public
figure
--
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
well,
mrs.
nixon,
following
of
mrs.
nixon
--
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
i
think
it
does
your
honor,
and
i
think
it
makes
the
difference
what
an
individual
is
doing.
mrs.
nixon
was
engaged
in
a
public
event,
and
i
think
that
demonstration,
though
it
was
not
involved
in
the
facts,
giving
rise
to
this
arrest.
the
arrest
in
no
way
had
to
do
with
the
fact
that
they
were
following
mrs.
nixon,
at
least
not
directly,
that
was
not
the
purported
cause
justifying
the
arrest.
but
certainly
that
demonstration
is
an
exercise,
i
think
in
the
most
important
sense
of
the
freedom
of
expression.
if
it
please
the
court,
we
would
like
to
reserve
whatever
time
we
have
for
rebuttal.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
yes.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
i
think
the
experience
referred
to
when
the
rice
case
was
argued
here
indicates
the
contrary.
if
that
were
to
be
done
it
would
be,
of
course,
self-defeating.
the
purpose
of
the
quarterly
court
is
for
the
convenience
of
the
state
at
least
as
much
as
and
i
think
more
than
for
the
convenience
of
the
defendant
and
this
would
only,
in
fact,
force
people
to
or
encourage
people
to
exercise
their
appeal
to
the
circuit
court.
so
i
don't
think
that's
very
realistic.
and
mr.
justice
white
asked
the
question
of
what
if
we
limit
the
pearce
decision
to
all
but
petty
offenses.
in
the
case
of
the
quarterly
court,
jail
is
a
realistic
prospect,
particularly,
in
cases
of
public
drunkenness,
which
is
a
common
sort
of
case
to
come
before
the
quarterly
court,
disorderly
conduct
cases
where
it's
a
second
or
third
offense,
quarterly
court
does
meet
out
jail
sentences.
even
if
we
are
dealing
with
a
much
more,
narrow
definition
of
petty
offenses,
i
still
would
argue
that
the
concept
of
due
process
is
applicable
whenever
the
government
of
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
or
the
government
of
the
united
states
is
acting
vis-a-vis
the
citizenry.
we're
entitled
no
matter
how
serious
the
penalty
imposed
to
a
procedure
that
has
an
inherent
fairness
and
i
think
therefore
that
when
there
is
a
purported
--
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
well,
the
jury
trial
in
the
quarterly
court
is
available.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
had
we
asked
for
the
jury
trial,
it
would
be.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
under
the
state
constitution.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
no,
under
the
state
constitution
it
would
be.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
under
the
federal
constitution,
i
think
it
would
be
too,
though
this
court
has
not
yet
so
held
in
the
cases.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
this
court
has
held
the
opposite,
i
would
hope
some
day
this
court
may
reconsider
that
issue,
particularly
in
light
of
the
fact
that
this
court
has
now
held
but
a
12
men
jury
is
not
necessary.
i
think
the
concerns
of
the
burden
on
the
state
that
may
influenced
prior
decisions
may
cause
this
court
to
rethink
that
it
should.
now
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
asked
my
opponent
whether
in
all
of
these
orders
to
leave
under
kentucky
law,
mr.
colten
could
have
been
convicted
for
failure
to
obey
and
the
question
was
asked
in
such
a
way
as
to
he
could
under
kentucky
law,
could
he
not.
and
i
agree
that
the
way
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
has
construed
this
statute
ad
we
find
that
instruction
on
pages
6
(a)
and
7
(a)
in
the
jurisdictional
statement,
that
the
way
it
has
construed
the
statute
indeed,
any
failure
to
obey
the
police
officer
would
subject
mr.
colten
to
a
penalty
under
the
statute,
unless
mr.
colten
could
establish
that
his
predominant
intent,
was
to
assert
a
constitutional
interest
and
even
then,
the
kentucky
court
would
balance
mere
inconvenience
to
a
police
officer
or
some
portion
of
the
public
against
the
asserted
constitutional
interest,
not
to
balance
this.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
their
rights
were
not
hindered
in
this
case,
we
felt
with
mr.
colten.
your
honor.
i
think
that
mr.
colten
failed
to
obey
an
order
as
part
of
the
crowd
that
was
blocking
a
highway
to
leave
the
highway,
then
he
could
properly
be
convicted
but
mr.
colten
left
the
highway.
he'd
been
at
the
edge
of
the
highway
and
he
--
there
was
an
announcement
to
leave
and
he
left
the
highway.
he
was
off
of
the
highway
so
that
he
was
not
causing
the
blockage.
the
blockage
was
caused
by
a
police
patrol
car
which
could
have
parked
on
the
opposite
shoulder.
now
there
is
also
a
suggestion
as
to
whether,
perhaps,
there
was
no
parking
here.
i
think
the
answer
is
that
he
was
not
convicted
for
failure
to
obey
a
no
parking
law,
in
fact,
the
record
the
best
the
record
shows
on
any
no
parking
requirements
is
that
there
may
have
been
signs
prohibiting
parking
on
that
side
of
the
road,
prior
to
the
group
leaving
the
airport,
that
is
earlier
in
the
day
there
may
have
been
signs
on
both
sides
of
the
road.
at
the
time,
the
group
left
the
airport,
any
no
parking
signs,
if
there
were
any,
were
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road,
not
where
these
cars
were
pulled
off
the
road.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
appellant
in
this
case
louis
colten
was
convicted
under
the
kentucky
disorderly
conduct
statute,
kentucky's
revised
statutes,
437-016.
he
was
convicted
under
provision
(f)
of
that
statute,
which
can
be
found
on
page
2
of
the
brief.
the
provision
under
which
he
was
convicted,
would
read
as
follows.
a
person
is
guilty
of
disorderly
conduct
if,
with
intent
to
cause
public
inconvenience,
annoyance
or
alarm,
or
recklessly
creating
a
risk
thereof,
he
congregates
with
other
persons
in
a
public
place
and
refuses
to
comply
with
a
lawful
order
of
the
police
to
disperse.
two
issues
are
presented
in
this
case
with
respect
to
that
provision.
one,
whether
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
construction
of
that
provision
has
rendered
it
unconstitutional
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
other,
whether
the
application
of
that
statute
to
the
facts
in
this
case,
is
unconstitutional
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
proceeding
under
which
mr.
colten
was
convicted,
under
which
he
was
convicted
in
the
judgment
from
which
this
appeal
is
being
taken
involves
a
two
step
trial
procedure.
in
kentucky,
misdemeanors
carrying
potential
penalty
of
up
to
12
months
imprisonment
and
up
to
$500
fine,
can
be
tried
in
an
inferior
criminal
court
as
was
mr.
colten
tried
in
an
inferior
criminal
court
in
this
situation,
the
quarterly
court
of
fayette
county.
the
only
way
an
appeal
can
be
taken
from
that
inferior
court
is
by
filing
for
a
trial
de
novo
in
the
court
of
general
jurisdiction,
the
circuit
court.
this
is
what
mr.
colten
did
in
order
to
frame
his
constitutional
challenges
when
he
was
convicted
in
the
inferior
court.
when
he
was
tried
the
second
time,
he
was
again
convicted,
but
this
time
the
penalty
imposed
upon
him
was
increased.
that
aspect
of
the
case
raises
the
third
issue
presented
before
this
court.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
in
his
case,
it
was
a
five-fold
increase
in
a
monetary
penalty
and
increase
from
a
$10
fine
to
a
$50
fine.
in
other
case,
pending
before
this
court
on
a
petition
for
certiorari
cases,
bell
v.
commonwealth,
number
70-5304,
involves
a
much
more
dramatic
increase
in
penalty.
in
that
case,
the
man
had
been
fined
and
quarterly
court
$1
plus
cost,
cost
paying
a
statutory
requirement
in
kentucky.
when
he
was
retried
in
the
circuit
court,
he
will
receive
the
penalty
of
$500
fine
and
5
months
28
days
imprisonment.
that
case
also
was
brought
under
this
disorderly
conduct
statute.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
in
the
particular
court
in
which
mr.
colten
and
mr.
bell
were
tried,
the
court
commissioner
is
a
lawyer.
the
situation
with
respect
to
the
quarterly
courts,
is
that
they
are
adjuncts
of
the
county
court.
the
county
court
is
for
the
most
part
an
administrative
position.
the
county
judge
is
in
essence
the
county
administrator
in
kentucky.
the
vast
majority
of
county
judges
in
kentucky
are
not
lawyers.
in
a
case
of
fayette
county,
he
happens
to
be
a
lawyer
and
in
the
case
of
fayette
county,
the
quarterly
court
commissioner
who
is
appointed
is
a
lawyer.
it's
my
understanding
though
that
frequently
the
county
judges
were
not
lawyers,
try
these
cases
themselves
and
that
where
commissioners
are
appointed
sometimes
they
are
not
lawyers.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
fayette
county
is
the
county
in
which
lexington
is
situated.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
no,
they
are
not.
there
is
no
provision
for
transcript.
my
conversations
on
that
matter
with
the
prosecuting
attorney
in
fayette
county,
is
that
the
defendant
can
secure
a
transcript
by
bringing
his
own
court
reporter
and
then
it's
a
matter
of
the
court
reporter's
certification
being
acceptable
to
any
court
which
is
later
to
review
the
matter.
i
would
point
out
on
that
account
that
the
appeal
from
the
quarterly
court
is
automatic
--
not
automatic
but
it's
a
matter
of
right.
one
does
not
have
to
apply
for
commission
to
appeal,
one
does
not
have
to
show
grounds
for
appeal.
one
can
appeal
as
a
matter
of
right
and
i
think
that
probably
the
reason
for
the
rule
being
that
way
is
a
recognition
that
the
nature
of
the
quarterly
court
proceeding
is
such,
the
nature
and
structure
of
the
quarterly
court
is
such
that
it
is
readily
presumed
that
errors
can
and
are
frequently
committed
with
respect
to
constitutional
rights
and
even
statutory
rights
and
indeed
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
below,
the
court
recognized
specifically
that
the
nature
of
these
inferior
court
trials
are
such,
that
all
of
the
constitutional
rights
of
a
defendant
are
normally
not
protected.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
the
rule
of
the
court
does
permit
that.
i
would
point
out
though
that
to
say
to
a
defendant,
all
you
have
to
do
is
plead
guilty
is
to
say
to
a
defendant,
all
you
have
to
do
is
waive
your
fifth
amendment
rights,
that
there
are
decisions
from
this
court
i
believe
with
respect
to
the
plead
bargaining
cases
suggesting
that
it
is
not
proper
for
a
court
to
accept
a
plea
of
guilty
unless
the
court
is
satisfied
that
indeed
the
defendant
is
meaningfully
admitting
his
guilt.
that
where
the
defendant
feels
that
he
is
not
guilty,
it
is
improper
for
a
court
to
impose
any
form
of
pressure
on
the
defendant
to
come
before
a
court
and
falsely
swear,
falsely
say
in
open
court,
i
am
guilty.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
no,
your
honor.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
he
had
a
lawyer.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
he
had
a
lawyer
at
the
quarterly
court.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart,
he
was
a
college
student.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
locally
at
the
university
of
kentucky
and
counsel
was
provided
for
him
--
voluntary
counsel
through
the
american
civil
liberties
union.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
my
understanding
is
that
there
were
few
witnesses
at
quarterly
court,
i
was
counsel
in
the
trial
de
novo
at
circuit
court
that
there
was
one
witness,
it's
my
understanding
--
my
recollection
my
co-counsel
telling
me
that
appeared
at
the
quarterly
court
that
did
not
appear,
police
officer
who
testified
at
the
quarterly
court
who
did
not
testify
at
the
circuit
court.
we
did
not
choose
to
call
that
witness
in
the
circuit
court.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
the
equivalent
of
approximately
one
day.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
i
don't
think
i
can
answer
that
question
with
sufficient
confidence.
i
have
sat
in
on
many
quarterly
court
trials.
i
was
present
at
the
trial
of
mr.
bell's
case
in
quarterly
court,
the
matter
that's
on
petition
for
certiorari,
that
case
took
all
about
ten
minutes.
most
trials
in
quarterly
court
run
somewhere
between
10
and
20
minutes.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
you
can,
the
kentucky
constitution
provides
for
a
six
member
jury.
the
jury
is
paid
by
the
losing
party.
it's
my
understanding
that
in
criminal
proceedings
therefore
where
the
defendant
is
found
guilty,
the
jury
costs
are
appended
to
the
other
costs
charged
to
him
and
for
that
reason
it's
my
understanding
that
when
one
seeks
a
jury
trial
in
the
quarterly
court,
that
person
has
to
post
a
bond
or
some
other
form
of
security
for
the
payment
of
the
jury
fee
which
works
out
to
be
i
believe
$30.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
no
your
honor,
he
did
not
ask
for
a
jury
trial
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
my
client
is
a
young
man
who
at
that
time
had
quite
long
hair,
rather
long
mustache
and
as
the
trial
judge
in
circuit
court
remarked
in
words
or
fact,
he
dresses
in
the
sort
of
way
that's
different
from
the
general
way
which
we
are
used
to
seeing
people
dress.
the
nature
of
the
typical
juror's
attitude
in
fayette
county
is
such
that
counsel
felt
that
we
could
get
a
fairer
trial
from
the
court
in
this
situation
than
from
a
jury.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
no,
and
i
might
point
out
that
the
way
the
procedure
is
set
up,
when
you
go
to
quarterly
court,
you
have
to
affirmatively
request
a
jury
trial.
in
circuit
court,
the
jury
trial
is
the
norm
and
one
specifically
waives.
in
fact,
there
are
a
number
of
situations
including
the
bell
case,
the
companion
case
in
which
the
court
will
reject
the
waiver
of
jury
trial.
bell
was
tried
by,
just
the
judge
in
quarterly
court.
he
was
tried
by
a
jury
because
the
court
and
prosecutor
both
insisted
on
a
jury
trial
when
it
came
for
the
trial
de
novo.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
no,
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
bell
case
rose
about
60
days
later
as
in
relation
to
a
campus
demonstration
connected
with
the
cambodian
incidence.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
it
was
at
the
university
of
kentucky.
it
involved
a
crowd
of
students
being
dispersed
by
the
state
police.
some
of
the
same
police
officers
were
involved
in
the
--
no,
bell
was
arrested
when
a
curfew
was
imposed
on
the
campus
and
a
group
approached
the
state
police
and
said
they
wanted
to
go
on
their
campus
and
in
effect
submitted
themselves
to
arrest
as
a
form
of
protest
against
what
they
thought
to
be,
what
they
contend
in
court
to
be,
and
unlawfully
imposed
curfew.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
no,
it
did
not.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
the
jury
does
determine
the
sentence
as
well
as
guilt
in
kentucky,
within
the
statutory
limits.
the
only
control
that
the
court
has
on
the
sentence
when
there
is
a
jury
trial
is
through
the
probationary
procedures.
in
the
case
of
the
bell
case
because
the
matter
is
still
being
litigated,
the
court
has
not
reached
the
point
of
having
the
probationary
issue
addressed
to
it.
the
facts
out
of
which
surrounding
the
arrest
of
mr.
colten
are,
i
think
of
some
considerable
significance.
in
the
background,
we
have
initially
a
meeting
of
mr.
colten
and
the
officer
who
eventually
took
him
into
custody,
tuper(ph)
harlow
at
the
airport
terminal
area.
shortly
before
mrs.
nixon's
plane
departed.
at
that
time
officer
harlow
testifies
that
mr.
colten
came
up
to
him
and
said
to
him,
we
are
going
to
have
a
party
out
here,
and
officer
harlow
replied
in
effect
not
over
here,
you
know.
he
said,
they
then
went
off
and
conducted
a
scene
somewhere
nearby.
in
this
connection,
he
testified
on
cross
examination
to
the
effect
that
he
was
offended
by
mr.
colten's
appearance
that
in
substance,
he
testified
the
fact
that
he
thinks
it's
quite
improper
for
a
group
of
people
looking
like
colten
looks
to
be
hanging
around
in
airport
entrance
where
in
his
words
an
awfully
a
lot
of
important
people
are
going
in
and
out.
he
did
not
make
any
arrest
at
that
time.
shortly
thereafter,
a
group
that
was
at
the
airport
was
departing
along
the
access
road.
one
of
those
departing
was
driving
an
automobile
with
an
out-of-state
license
plate
that
had
expired.
trooper
miller
pulled
the
car
that
was
driving
with
the
out-of-date
license
off
to
the
side
of
the
road,
pulled
completely
off
to
the
side
of
the
access
road.
trooper
miller
pulled
in
behind
that
car
and
mr.
colten
who
knew
the
driver
of
the
car
that
was
pulled
over
behind
the
trooper's
car.
he
got
out
of
the
car,
he
learned
that
the
car
that
had
been
pulled
was
to
be
toed
away.
there
were
total
of
five
passengers
in
that
car.
mr.
colten
had
some
room
in
his
own
automobile
and
at
least
one
of
the
police
officers
conformed
the
testimony
of
the
defense
witnesses
that
mr.
colten
said
when
told
to
leave
by
police
officers
that
he
wanted
to
give
a
ride
back
to
lexington
to
these
people.
the
officer
who
apprehended
mr.
colten
admitted
that
mr.
colten
indeed
may
have
said
that.
any
event
--
some
other
cars
pulled
over
to
the
side
and
there
was
a
number
of
people
variously
estimated
from
about
12
to
18
throughout
the
area
where
the
cars
were
pulled
over.
one
officer
testified
that
there
was
at
one
point
at
least,
15
persons
in
the
access
road.
the
captain
who
was
in-charge
of
the
detail
out
at
the
airport
pulled
up
in
the
access
road
blocking
that
road,
got
out
of
his
vehicle
and
told
these
people
to
leave,
get
in
your
cars
and
leave.
other
police
officers
stopped
and
similarly
got
out
of
their
cars,
went
over
to
the
crowd
and
said,
leave,
get
in
your
cars
and
leave,
you
have
no
business
here.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
no,
the
evidence
only
show
that
they
were
people
who
are
out
at
the
airport.
one
of
the
individuals
who
testified
for
the
defense,
for
example,
had
not
known
mr.
colten
until
he
accepted
an
offer
for
a
ride
in
mr.
colten's
car,
a
ride
back
to
lexington.
so
it
appeared
that
at
least
some
of
the
people
who
pulled
off
to
the
side
were
there
at
the
site,
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
--
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
no
it
was
not,
your
honor.
there
is
--
at
least
the
record
does
not
indicate
that
clearly,
one
way
or
the
other,
many
things
--
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
it's
not
clear
in
the
record
mr.
mendez
and
mr.
colten
knew
each
other
but
where
mr.
mendez
is,
it's
not
--
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
that's
not
revealed
in
the
record.
now,
at
a
point
in
which
mr.
colten
was
clearly
off
of
the
road,
on
the
shoulder.
officer
harlow
came
up
to
mr.
colten
and
told
him
to
leave.
colten
according
to
officer
harlow
said,
i
want
to
stay
around
and
see
what's
happening.
on
the
constitutional
issues,
i
think
we
are
perfectly
willing
to
argue
the
case
strictly
in
terms
of
mr.
colten
having
said
nothing
more
than
i
want
to
stand
around
and
see
what's
happening.
officer
harlow
told
mr.
colten
to
leave
several
times
and
then
grab
mr.
colten
and
started
to
lead
him
toward
the
road.
at
that
point,
a
group
of
other
police
officers
came
over,
and
record
is
fairly
clear
that
mr.
colten
was
at
that
point
roughed
up.
i
point
that
out
not
in
any
effort
to
win
any
sympathy
for
mr.
colten,
after
all
if
he
has
any
course
for
complaint
about
that,
he
has
a
civil
action.
but
i
think
it
is
of
significance
in
this
case,
because
one
of
our
contentions
is
that
the
interpretive
gloss
placed
upon
the
statute
by
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals,
renders
it
excessively
vague
and
over
broad.
and
this
court
has
frequently
pointed
out,
that
one
of
the
deficiencies,
constitutional
deficiencies
have
penal
statues
which
are
excessively
broad
and
over
vague,
is
that
they
provide
an
invitation
to
abuse
by
law
enforcement
authorities.
and
i
think
there
is
good
evidence
to
suggest
that,
in
fact
that
is
what
happened
here.
that
when
we
look
at
the
situation
realistically,
what
we
have
here
is
a
group
of
people
who
cause
these
police
officers
to
have
a
long
hard
day
of
duty.
this
was
a
group
that
as
the
record
shows
had
been
following
mrs.
nixon
around.
they
were
clearly
not
sympathetic
to
mrs.
nixon's
presence.
the
police
officers
had
just
finished
a
long
hard
day
of
duty.
there
are
some
indications
in
the
record
that
trial
court
gave
some
recognition
that
these
police
officers
may
not
have
felt
too
kindly
to
these
individuals.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
well,
both
the
police
officers
and
these
individuals
who
had
been
out
at
the
airport.
they
had
mrs.
nixon
had
a
tour
of
the
lexington
area,
and
this
group
had
been
going
from
place
to
place
demonstrating
in
favor
of
their
gubernatorial
candidate.
the
gubernatorial
candidate,
being
in
effect
a
protest
candidate
and
they
explained
that
the
reason,
they
were
demonstrating
for
the
gubernatorial
candidate
was
to
overtly
ignore
mrs.
nixon's
presence.
now,
the
police
officers
after
this
long
hard
day,
are
confronted
with
the
situation
which
a
fellow
officer
is
issuing
a
citation.
a
group
of
these
people
are
standing
around
and
they
come
over
and
they
do,
what
i
think
our
experience
tells
us
is
a
normal
police
practice.
it
doesn't
necessarily
mean
it's
a
constitutionally
valid
police
practice.
they
come
up
to
the
crowd,
they
don't
say
get
off
the
road,
they
don't
say
give
the
officers
some
clearance,
the
particular
officer
was
issuing
the
citation,
did
not
complain
about
mr.
colten
to
the
captain,
who
came
over
to
him,
to
ask
him
what
was
going
on.
he
did
not
seek
to
arrest
mr.
colten,
he
did
not
ask
anyone
to
arrest
mr.
colten,
he
in
fact
issued
his
citation
without
any
serious
problems.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
he
testified
that
he
went
back
to
his
own
patrol
car,
closed
the
window
and
proceeded
to
issue
the
citation.
there
was
some
suggestion
made
by
him,
that
he
had
to
do
this
because
of
mr.
colten,
nevertheless,
when
his
own
captain
came
to
him.
after
he
went
to
his
patrol
car
and
asked
them
what's
going
on?
the
captain's
testimony
shows
nothing
nor
does
trooper
miller's
testimony,
show
anything
to
the
effect
that
trooper
miller
said,
that
man
is
interfering
with
me.
i
haven't
been
--
i'm
having
a
problem
issuing
the
citation.
the
fact
is
that
mr.
colten
was
convicted
not
for
interfering
with
the
police
officer,
he
was
convicted
for
failure
to
disperse
upon
“lawful”
order
of
the
police.
so
we
have
a
situation
which
the
police
say,
disperse.
and
this
individual
declines
to
disperse.
he's
thereupon
arrested.
i
think
that
in
most
respects,
this
case
is
really
very
close
to
recent
decisions
of
this
court
in
cases
such
as,
papachristou,
and
i
believe
it's
the
godin
case.
the
basic
question
is,
what's
the
quality
of
life
under
our
constitution?
to
what
extent
is
the
presumption
under
our
constitution
a
presumption
of
lawfulness?
to
what
extent
is
the
presumption
under
our
constitution
and
authoritarian
presumption?
does
the
citizen
have
to
jump,
because
the
police
officer
addresses
him
and
says,
leave,
or
is
the
burden
upon
the
police
and
the
prosecutor
to
show
that
now
you
are
ordered
to
leave,
because
there
was
a
compelling
need
to
order
you
to
leave.
in
this
situation,
i
don't
think
the
evidence
shows
any
such
compelling
need
to
leave.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
yes,
when
there
is
such
a
constitutional
right
to
be
balanced
against
the
constitutional
rights
of
assembling
an
expression,
those
rights
have
to
be
balanced.
a
police
officer
performing
his
duties
though
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
not
think
has
a
claim
to
a
right
of
privacy.
he
is
a
public
figure
--
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
well,
mrs.
nixon,
following
of
mrs.
nixon
--
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
i
think
it
does
your
honor,
and
i
think
it
makes
the
difference
what
an
individual
is
doing.
mrs.
nixon
was
engaged
in
a
public
event,
and
i
think
that
demonstration,
though
it
was
not
involved
in
the
facts,
giving
rise
to
this
arrest.
the
arrest
in
no
way
had
to
do
with
the
fact
that
they
were
following
mrs.
nixon,
at
least
not
directly,
that
was
not
the
purported
cause
justifying
the
arrest.
but
certainly
that
demonstration
is
an
exercise,
i
think
in
the
most
important
sense
of
the
freedom
of
expression.
if
it
please
the
court,
we
would
like
to
reserve
whatever
time
we
have
for
rebuttal.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
yes.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
i
think
the
experience
referred
to
when
the
rice
case
was
argued
here
indicates
the
contrary.
if
that
were
to
be
done
it
would
be,
of
course,
self-defeating.
the
purpose
of
the
quarterly
court
is
for
the
convenience
of
the
state
at
least
as
much
as
and
i
think
more
than
for
the
convenience
of
the
defendant
and
this
would
only,
in
fact,
force
people
to
or
encourage
people
to
exercise
their
appeal
to
the
circuit
court.
so
i
don't
think
that's
very
realistic.
and
mr.
justice
white
asked
the
question
of
what
if
we
limit
the
pearce
decision
to
all
but
petty
offenses.
in
the
case
of
the
quarterly
court,
jail
is
a
realistic
prospect,
particularly,
in
cases
of
public
drunkenness,
which
is
a
common
sort
of
case
to
come
before
the
quarterly
court,
disorderly
conduct
cases
where
it's
a
second
or
third
offense,
quarterly
court
does
meet
out
jail
sentences.
even
if
we
are
dealing
with
a
much
more,
narrow
definition
of
petty
offenses,
i
still
would
argue
that
the
concept
of
due
process
is
applicable
whenever
the
government
of
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
or
the
government
of
the
united
states
is
acting
vis-a-vis
the
citizenry.
we're
entitled
no
matter
how
serious
the
penalty
imposed
to
a
procedure
that
has
an
inherent
fairness
and
i
think
therefore
that
when
there
is
a
purported
--
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
well,
the
jury
trial
in
the
quarterly
court
is
available.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
had
we
asked
for
the
jury
trial,
it
would
be.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
under
the
state
constitution.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
no,
under
the
state
constitution
it
would
be.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
under
the
federal
constitution,
i
think
it
would
be
too,
though
this
court
has
not
yet
so
held
in
the
cases.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
this
court
has
held
the
opposite,
i
would
hope
some
day
this
court
may
reconsider
that
issue,
particularly
in
light
of
the
fact
that
this
court
has
now
held
but
a
12
men
jury
is
not
necessary.
i
think
the
concerns
of
the
burden
on
the
state
that
may
influenced
prior
decisions
may
cause
this
court
to
rethink
that
it
should.
now
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
asked
my
opponent
whether
in
all
of
these
orders
to
leave
under
kentucky
law,
mr.
colten
could
have
been
convicted
for
failure
to
obey
and
the
question
was
asked
in
such
a
way
as
to
he
could
under
kentucky
law,
could
he
not.
and
i
agree
that
the
way
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
has
construed
this
statute
ad
we
find
that
instruction
on
pages
6
(a)
and
7
(a)
in
the
jurisdictional
statement,
that
the
way
it
has
construed
the
statute
indeed,
any
failure
to
obey
the
police
officer
would
subject
mr.
colten
to
a
penalty
under
the
statute,
unless
mr.
colten
could
establish
that
his
predominant
intent,
was
to
assert
a
constitutional
interest
and
even
then,
the
kentucky
court
would
balance
mere
inconvenience
to
a
police
officer
or
some
portion
of
the
public
against
the
asserted
constitutional
interest,
not
to
balance
this.
mr.
alvin
l.
goldman
their
rights
were
not
hindered
in
this
case,
we
felt
with
mr.
colten.
your
honor.
i
think
that
mr.
colten
failed
to
obey
an
order
as
part
of
the
crowd
that
was
blocking
a
highway
to
leave
the
highway,
then
he
could
properly
be
convicted
but
mr.
colten
left
the
highway.
he'd
been
at
the
edge
of
the
highway
and
he
--
there
was
an
announcement
to
leave
and
he
left
the
highway.
he
was
off
of
the
highway
so
that
he
was
not
causing
the
blockage.
the
blockage
was
caused
by
a
police
patrol
car
which
could
have
parked
on
the
opposite
shoulder.
now
there
is
also
a
suggestion
as
to
whether,
perhaps,
there
was
no
parking
here.
i
think
the
answer
is
that
he
was
not
convicted
for
failure
to
obey
a
no
parking
law,
in
fact,
the
record
the
best
the
record
shows
on
any
no
parking
requirements
is
that
there
may
have
been
signs
prohibiting
parking
on
that
side
of
the
road,
prior
to
the
group
leaving
the
airport,
that
is
earlier
in
the
day
there
may
have
been
signs
on
both
sides
of
the
road.
at
the
time,
the
group
left
the
airport,
any
no
parking
signs,
if
there
were
any,
were
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road,
not
where
these
cars
were
pulled
off
the
road.
