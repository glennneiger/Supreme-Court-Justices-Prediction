justice
potter
stewart
but
in
this
case,
your
client
did
not
plead
guilty
in
the
quarterly
court,
did
he?
justice
potter
stewart
if
he
is
not
guilty,
did
he
had
a
lawyer.
justice
potter
stewart
at
the
quarterly
court?
justice
potter
stewart
was
he
a
college
student?
justice
potter
stewart
locally
there
in
lexington?
justice
potter
stewart
did
the
same
witnesses
testify
at
both
trials?
justice
potter
stewart
how
long
did
it
take
you
to
try
the
case
in
the
circuit
court?
justice
potter
stewart
how
long
did
it
take
in
quarterly
court
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
your
client
didn't
ask
for
a
jury
trial
in
the
court?
justice
potter
stewart
you
didn't
ask
for
a
jury
trial
in
the
court
of
general
jurisdiction
either?
justice
potter
stewart
did
the
bell
case
arise
from
this
from
events
occurring
on
the
same
day
of
mrs.
nixon's
visit
to
the
place.
justice
potter
stewart
at
the
university
of
kentucky?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
we
need
to
go
further
than
the
bell
case
and
in
any
event,
it
didn't
arise
from
anything
related
to
these
events.
justice
potter
stewart
did
the
evidence
show
that
except
for
the
police
officers,
most
of
the
members
of
the
crowd
or
group
were
the
same
people,
who
had
been
whooping
and
hollering
party
out
at
the
airport?
justice
potter
stewart
so
it
was
not
a
regathering
of
the
same
group.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
mendez,
had
he
been
a
member
of
the
group?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
all
we
know
from
the
record.
justice
potter
stewart
who
had
been
following
mrs.
nixon
around
the
police
officers
or
--?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
he
had
to
do
go
back
into
the
gomez's
car
in
order
to
do
it.
justice
potter
stewart
he
was
a
state
police
officer
or
county
or
city?
justice
potter
stewart
highway
patrol?
justice
potter
stewart
whether
or
not
colten
was
mistreated
that
day
by
the
police,
has
no
bearing
on
the
issues
in
this
case,
does
he?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
after
the
arrest.
justice
potter
stewart
that
12
to
18
people
include
the
policeman?
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
cars
does
the
record
show
had
pulled
up
and
stopped
on
the
shoulder
of
the
road?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
a
transcript
of
the
proceedings
in
the
quarterly
court
here?
justice
potter
stewart
just
the
transcript
above.
we
don't
know
whether
the
evidence
was
the
same
at
both
trials.
justice
potter
stewart
and
ordinarily
i
take
that
quarterly
court
proceedings
are
not
transcribed.
justice
potter
stewart
can
i
ask
one
more
question,
i
take
it
--
the
circuit
court
is
actually
a
upper
court.
justice
potter
stewart
i
take
it,
now
the
court
knew,
this
was
a
trial
without
a
jury
wasn't
it.
that
the
court
knew
that
the
sentence
imposed
in
the
quarterly
court
was
$10.
justice
potter
stewart
he
didn't
say
why
he
chose
to
pose
of
$50
rather
than
$10
fine.
justice
potter
stewart
now
with
this
advice,
before
you
can
do
that,
you
do
have
to
--
judge
does
have
to
say
why
he
has
done
it
and
within
the
limits
of
circumstances
under
which
he
may
make
the
increase.
justice
potter
stewart
why
don't
think
that
same
requirements
apply
in
these
case.
justice
potter
stewart
or
he
could
just
plea
guilty
without
saying
even
that
and
yet
get
a
trial
de
novo.
justice
potter
stewart
what's
the
maximum
that
could
have
been
imposed?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
what
happened
in
this
other
case.
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
suppose
kentucky
wouldn't
have
been
obligated
to
give
him
in
a
constitutional
sentence.
justice
potter
stewart
exactly
and
yet
some
states
do
so
provide
that
a
more
severe
sentence
cannot
be
imposed
upon
a
new
trial
and
told
us
in
a
case
argued
earlier
this
term
that
it
does
not
hamper
their
system,
those
referred
to
in
petitioner's
brief,
that
is
what
he
is
trying
to
call
the
attention.
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
the
courts
would
take
it
that
(inaudible)
wouldn't
apply
to
petty
offenses?
justice
potter
stewart
what
would
that
do
in
kentucky?
is
the
quarterly
court
involved
with
the
serious
crimes?
justice
potter
stewart
well
are
they
limited
where
they
may
impose
punishment
to
ordinances
or
statutes
which
limit
to
six
months?
justice
potter
stewart
below
12,
well,
that's
not
quite
blindly
drawn
on
petty
offenses.
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
suppose
it
does
with
lot
of
statutes
where
the
penalty
is
less
than
six
months,
the
possible
penalty.
justice
potter
stewart
and
also
suppose
whatever
the
authorized
penalty
is
jailed
very
often
can
be
meted
out
in
the
quarterly
court?
justice
potter
stewart
is
jail
really
a
realistic
threat
in
the
quarterly
court?
justice
potter
stewart
not
jury
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
but
is
it
constitutionally
required?
would
a
jury
trial
have
been
constitutionally
required
under
the
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
under
the
state
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
not
in
the
federal.
justice
potter
stewart
but
not
the
federal.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
held
the
opposite,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
this
case,
your
client
did
not
plead
