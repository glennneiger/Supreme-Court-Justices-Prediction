mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
in
this
case,
that
we
need
to
go
back
to
the
facts
and
on
this
day
trooper
miller,
the
trooper
who
stopped
the
mendez
car.
his
chief
duties
were
to
keep
the
access
road
to
the
airport
free
and
clear
of
traffic
and
to
keep
traffic
moving
on.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
state
police,
all
the
officers
involved
in
the
--
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
yes,
sir,
captain
state
police.
his
commanding
officer
captain
mayes
testified
that
he
gave
verbal
instructions
as
to
the
security,
the
traffic
flow
not
letting
it
by
stop
on
the
road.
i
think
this
is
normal
precautions
when
you
have
a
dignitary
visiting.
and
trooper
miller
pulled
mendez's
car
over
solely,
because
it
had
an
expired
license
plate.
there
was
no
cause
for
colten
to
stop,
but
he
did.
he
got
out
of
his
car,
he
proceeded
up
and
asked
trooper
miller,
why
he
had
stopped
the
mendez
car.
trooper
miller
explained
to
him
why
he
had
done
this
that
the
license
plate
was
expired,
then
asked
him
to
please
leave,
as
it
was
none
of
his
concern.
colten's
reply
was,
no
i
want
to
stay
around
and
see,
what's
going
to
happen.
and
he
keeps
badgering
and
trooper
miller
is
worried.
he
became
obnoxious
to
the
point
that
trooper
miller
had
to
return
to
his
cruiser
in
order
to
fill
out
the
ticket.
captain
mayes
(ph)
was
the
next
car
to
stop,
the
next
police
car
to
stop.
he
came
up
and
tapped
on
trooper
miller's
car
and
asked
him,
what
the
problem
was
and
did
he
have
these
people
stop?
trooper
miller
replied,
no
i
have
asked
him
to
leave,
i
don't
have
him
stopped.
and
captain
mayes
said,
well
i
just
want
to
check
and
then
he
proceeded
along
with,
i
believe
it
was
lieutenant
maverley
(ph)
who
was
in
his
car
proceeded
to
get
out,
and
expressed
general
directions
to
the
crowd,
to
please
disperse,
to
leave,
and
he
testified
that
he
saw
appellant
in
the
crowd
that
he
addressed
this,
these
comments
to.
by
this
time
there
were
some
six
to
ten
cars
which
colten
himself
testified
were
part
of
the
procession.
that
had
gone
to
the
airport
together
and
were
leaving
together.
and
people
were
getting
out
of
their
cars,
they
were
standing
in
the
roadway.
the
police
cars
were
forced
to
park
on
the
roadway.
and
i
think
that
the
access
road
must
be
understood,
it
is
only
a
two
lane
road.
it
is
not
very
wide,
there
are
fences
on
either
side
of
it.
there
was
testimony,
that
there
were
no
parking
signs
on
the
other
side
of
the
road,
now
today
there
are
no
parking
signs
on
both
sides
of
the
road.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
i
think
that
the
gravel
portion
of
the
shoulder
was
estimated
at
two
feet.
i
don't
think
there
is
an
actual
width
estimated,
it's
about
18
to
20
feet
wide.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
immediately
to
the
right.
colten
testified
that
trooper
harlow
when
he
grabbed
him
by
the
arm
pushed
him
up
against
the
fence.
so
it's
not
more
than
i
would
say
8
to
10
feet
from
the
shoulder
to
the
fence,
at
a
distance.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
i
don't
think
the
record
shows
a
distance,
a
firm
distance
and
the
only
thing
i
can
give
is
an
approximation
from
my
own
recollection.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
off
the
road.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
well
there
is
testimony.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
pardon.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
colten
stopped
his
car
off
the
road
behind
trooper
miller's
car.
then
captain
mayes
pulled
his
car
up
on
the
surface
almost
abreast
with
trooper
miller's,
the
back
of
trooper
miller's.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
colten
was
standing
in
the
road
while
talking
to
trooper
miller.
now,
he
was
up
by
mendez's
car
and
there
was
disputed
testimony
as
to
which.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
there
is
disputed
testimony,
his
testimony
is
that
he
was
standing
by
the
right
front
fender
and
the
officers
testified
that
he
was
variously
in
the
road
and
off
the
road
and
walking
around
the
car.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
well
they
parked
off
the
shoulder
and
in
front
of
mendez's
car
and
behind
the
police
cars
had
stopped
--
three
more
police
cars.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
no
your
honor.
the
police
cars
--
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
the
police
cars
were
in
the
roadway.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
that
and
the
crowd
was
in
the
roadway.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
well,
it
was
15,
approximately
12
to
15
to
18
people.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
the
testimony,
depending
on
which
side
you
look
at
it,
puts
them
in
the
roadway
or
on
the
right
side
of
the
car,
some
of
them
still
in
the
cars.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
well,
the
--
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
no,
no
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
the
trooper
miller
had
his
light
flashing,
he
had
a
person
sitting
in
the
car,
there
was
car
in
front
of
him,
a
car
in
behind
of
him,
captain
mayes
got
out
of
his
car
and
asked
him,
what's
going
on.
he
said,
i
have
got
this
car
stopped
for
a
traffic
violation
and
captain
mayes
said,
are
these
people
needed,
are
they
important
or
what
are
these
other
people
doing?
and
trooper
miller
said,
i
don't
know,
i
have
asked
him
to
leave,
i
don't
have
him
stopped.
and
by
this
time
more
people
were
getting
out
of
their
cars
and
captain
mayes
proceeded
to
attempt
to
clear
the
roadway.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
well
after
captain
mayes
told
the
crowd
some
four
or
five
times
to
please
leave,
trooper
brown
got
at,
was
third
state
policeman
in
line,
he
got
out
and
asked
colten
two
times
to
leave
and
he
kept
telling
him,
i
am
going
to
stay
around
and
see
what
happens.
and
finally
trooper
harlow
came
up
to
colten
and
said
are
you
going
to
leave?
and
he
said,
yes
i
am
going
to
leave,
but
i
want
to
see
what
happens
first.
and
then
he
grabbed
him
by
the
arm
and
he
says,
now
are
you
going
to
leave?
he
said,
yes,
but
i
want
to
see
what
happens
first
and
then
he
arrested
him
for
--
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
i
don't
personally
know
why
he
grabbed
him
by
the
arm.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
i
don't
think
he
denied
it.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
i
don't
know
that
he
hit
him
your
honor.
i
think
he
grabbed
him
by
his
arm
and
was
walking
towards
the
police
wagon
and
i
think
that's
why
they
went
up
against
the
fence.
maybe
colten
was
back
and
away
from
him,
i
don't
--
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
no
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
and
i
think
that
in
this
case
where
we
have
got
to
apply
the
standards
of
vagueness
and
over
breadth
to
the
actual
facts
and
appellant
has
made
much
of
the
fact
that
he
feels
his
speech,
freedom
of
speech
and
freedom
of
assembly
was
tightened.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
standing
for
him
to
allege
that.
i
don't
think
that
he
has
any
freedom
of
assembly,
freedom
of
speech
in
this
case.
the
police
were
merely
trying
to
clear
the
roadway.
they
were
not
prosecuting
appellant,
he
has
made
much
all
the
way
up
here
about
his
appearance
and
the
fact
that
the
police
may
have
been
down
on
him.
but
i
think
that
the
exact
opposite
can
be
assumed
from
this
record
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
they
told
him
ten
times
to
please
leave.
now,
it
seems
absurd
that
he
didn't
understand
them,
that
he
didn't
realize
that
they
were
asking
him
to
leave
and
several
police
officers
testified
that
they
asked
him
please
to
leave.
and
he
even
states
on
his
direct
examination
that
i
know
better
than
to
interfere
with
the
police
officer
in
whatever
he
was
doing.
so
i
hadn't
said
a
word
to
the
police
officer.
now,
this
is
in
contrast
of
the
testimony
of
trooper
miller
who
says
that
colten
comes
up
and
he
has
asked
him
why
he
has
stopped
the
car
and
he
is
asked
to
leave.
now,
the
statute
on
its
face,
made
me
divide
it
into
three
parts.
the
first
part
is
was
their
intent
to
call
this
any
public
inconvenience,
annoyance
or
alarm
or
recklessly
create
a
risk
thereof.
now,
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
great
alarm
here,
any
great
annoyance,
no
tremendous
inconvenience.
but,
the
fact
that
mrs.
nixon
was
at
the
airport,
one
may
assume
that
there
was
a
fairly
substantial
crowd,
as
well-wishers
wishing
mrs.
nixon
a
happy
trip
back
and
that
they
were
leaving
the
airport
at
this
time.
now,
when
you
take
six
cars
and
pull
them
off
on
a
shoulder
and
three
police
cars
in
the
roadway,
so
that
only
one
lane
is
open,
you
severely
congested
the
traffic.
now,
the
main
objective
of
police
was
they
want
to
break
it
up,
they
weren't
trying
to
arrest
anybody,
they
weren't
looking
to
bust
anybody,
they
just
wanted
to
get
the
traffic
moving.
and
i
think
the
intent
is
clear
by
colten's
stopping,
by
his
continued
refusal
to
leave.
now,
second
part
of
the
statute
is
did
he
congregate
with
others
in
a
public
place?
i
think
there
is
ample
testimony
in
the
record
that
crowd
was
estimated
from
12
to
approximately
18
people
that
they
were
standing
in
the
roadway.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
no
your
honor.
there
were
testimony
from
i
believe
5-9
policeman
different
--
there
were
four
state
--
five
state
troopers
there,
four
of
them
testified
at
the
circuit
court
trial.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
the
defense
or
the
civilian
cars
were
estimated
between
6
and
10
and
there
were
three
state
police
vehicles
and
there
has
to
have
been
a
county
police
vehicle
because
it
was
a
county
police
(inaudible),
now
that
one
came
up
later.
so
there
were
approximately
9
or
10
vehicles
there
with
3
of
them
being
state
police
cars.
and
a
public
place
is
--
a
highway
is
a
public
place,
any
place
that
the
public
travels
is
defined
as
a
public
place
and
finally
we
have
to
look
and
see
did
he
violate
a
lawful
order
of
the
police
to
disperse.
now,
the
order
of
the
police
must
be
lawful
and
i
submit
that
in
this
case
the
fact
that
they
were
trying
to
clear
the
road
of
traffic
to
provide
a
free
moving
flow
of
traffic
that
by
necessity
made
this
a
lawful
order
that
the
police
have
autonomous
control
of
traffic.
that's
one
of
their
primary
responsibilities,
as
regulation
and
enforcement.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
serves
both,
it
is
an
entrance
and
an
exit
from
the
airport
and
other
than
a
road
that
winds
through
a
park
going
out
the
back
way,
it's
the
only
entrance
to
the
lexington
blue
grass
airport.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
no
your
honor,
there
is
no
testimony
to
that
effect.
there
is
testimony
by
the
officers
at
the
traffic
at
that
time
was
very
heavy
and
the
defense
has
testified
that
there
was
no
traffic
on
the
road
at
that
time.
finally,
the
third
part
of
the
statute,
i
think
it's
clear
that
colten
refused
to
disperse
after
being
so
asked.
now,
this
statute
kentucky
disorderly
conduct
statute
is
very
similar
to
the
statute
in
the
shuttleworth
case.
there
the
regulation
had
to
do
with
regulating
flow
on
a
side
wall,
but
the
wording
is
essentially
the
same
and
in
that
case
the
alabama
supreme
court
interpreted
the
alabama
statute,
so
as
to
make
it
constitutional
and
i
think
in
this
case
the
kentucky
legislature
enacted
this
disorderly
conduct
statute
based
on
a
statute
similar
to
the
shuttleworth
case,
so
as
to
make
it
constitutional.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
when
he
was
physically
placed
under
arrest
he
was
on
the
right
side
of
the
cars
that
had
pulled
off
the
road.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
your
honor
he
wandered
all
over.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
by
which
officer
your
honor,
he
was
told
by
--
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
ten
times.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
at
least
ten
times.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
i
believe
the
record
will
show
that
he
was
standing
at
the
right
rear
fender
of
the
mendez
vehicle.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
the
mendez
vehicle
was
off
the
road.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
he
was
standing
by
the
right
rear
fender
of
the
car,
the
car
was
off
the
road.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
no
sir,
he
wasn't
out
in
the
street
at
the
time
trooper
harlow
arrested
him.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
i
think
it
would
your
honor.
in
regard
to
the
increase
in
punishment
from
the
fayette
quarterly
court
to
the
fayette
circuit
court,
i
think
that
the
pearce
decision
as
set
forth
in
the
opinion
applies
to
retrials,
a
case
where
a
man
secures
a
reversal
and
there
were
errors
committed
at
the
trial,
he
has
appealed
from
errors.
now
the
spirit
of
pearce
seems
to
be
that
a
person
should
not
be
in
fear
of
following
an
appeal.
i
think
that
the
trial
de
novo
system
should
not
be
governed
by
that,
because
here
there
are
no
errors
appealed
from
the
judgment,
the
sentence,
the
plea,
the
evidence
and
nothing
that
is
introduced
at
the
quarterly
court.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
no
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
i
think
it
was
more
thorough
in
the
circuit
court,
i
think
there
were
more
witnesses
other
than
the
fact
that
i
think.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
no
your
honor
you
must
bring
your
own
(inaudible)
in
if
you
wish
to
transcript.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
no
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
$10
in
the
quarterly
court.
now,
there
was
nothing
used
in
the
circuit
court.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
i
am
sure
they
did,
mrs.
wilson
in
her
closing
argument
mentioned
the
$10
fine
in
the
lower
court.
so
whether
he
knew
it
from
any
other
source
or
not
i
am
sure
he
got
it
from
that.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
no
your
honor,
there
is
no
explanation
of
why
he
increased
it
from
10
to
$50.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
and
i
think
that
is
to
show
if
there
is
a
lack
of
any
vindictiveness
or
that
he
is
applying
a
penalty
for
the
--
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
because
i
think
this
is
a
whole
new
ball
game.
as
i
say
in
kentucky
a
man
could
walk
in
and
plead
guilty
and
say
your
honor
i
am
sorry,
i
didn't
mean
to
do
that
and
--
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
right
and
he
could
all
for
mitigating
circumstances
and
receive
a
suspended
sentence
and
to
require
the
circuit
court
to
try
a
man
later
on
the
same
case
on
a
not
a
guilty
plea
and
then
be
unable
to
impose
any
punishment
whatsoever,
defeats
the
whole
purpose
of
the
trial
de
novo
system.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
six
months
and
$500.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
bell
case;
i
am
not
familiar
with
that
other
than
i
have
seen
the
brief
in
the
case.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
in
the
circuit
court
they
would
have
been
banned
by
the
constitution
to
give
him
a
jury
trial,
yet,
expressly
by
state
constitution
and
statute.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
it
must
be
expressed
as
a
waive
from
the
circuit
court.
but
the
purpose
of
the
quarterly
court
is
to
serve
as
a
court
of
convenience.
that's
where
any
traffic
tickets
or
any
misdemeanors.
i
would
say
that
85%
of
the
cases
are
guilty
pleas
which
rather
government
said
were
disposed
off
five
minutes,
ten
minutes
if
that
long.
the
majority
of
the
lower
courts,
adjuncts
on
the
county
court
system,
the
commissioners
or
the
judges
are
not
lawyers.
in
lexington
we
are
fortunate
to
have
a
judge
as
a
commissioner
of
the
quarterly
court.
but
they
just
merely
provide
an
outlet
for
speedy
administration
of
justice.
now
if
a
person
wishes
a
full
bond
trial,
he
can
either
go
through
a
short
trial
in
quarterly
court
or
he
may
plea
guilty
and
then
just
walk
out
the
door
and
around
the
quarter
and
file
for
his
trial
de
novo
in
the
circuit
clerk's
office.
i
think
that
approximately
half
the
states
employee
have
trial
de
novo
system.
some
are
tending
to
lean
away
from
it,
some
are
adhering
to
it
and
i
think
that
to
hold
that
the
trial
de
novo
system
is
under
the
guidelines
of
north
carolina
versus
pearce
would
severely
hamper
this
system.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
but
i
think
that
in
a
trial
de
novo
system
that
it
is
essential
that
the
state
and
the
accused
start
out
at
parity,
that
you
are
hamstringing
the
prosecution,
if
there
is
a
very
low
fine
or
a
suspended
sentence
or
a
probated
sentence.
the
prosecutor
is
not
going
to
want
to
try
a
case
where
even
a
jury
cannot
impose
any
punishment
and
this
is
either
going
to
force
the
quarterly
court
out
of
existence
except
to
hear
maybe
guilty
pleas
or
it's
going
to
result
in
the
quarterly
court
hanging
down
the
maximum
sentences.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
i
think
that
that
should
be
a
distinguishing
characteristic.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
sometimes
they
act
as
an
examining
trial
or
preliminary
act.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
i
think
they
are
limited
to
below
12
months
and
--
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
in
my
personal
experience,
no,
not
in
cases
like
this.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
it
isn't
for
first
defenders.
now,
where
the
government
will
reside
again
to
the
bell
case.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
six
months
and
$500
fine.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
so
in
conclusion,
i
would
say
that
the
appellant
has
no
standing
to
question,
the
constitutionality
of
the
disorderly
conduct
statute
of
kentucky.
he
was
not
engaged
to
any
protective
activity.
he
was
disrupting
traffic,
he
was
asked
to
leave
by
four
policemen
ten
times.
they
were
not
picking
on
him,
they
just
wanted
to
get
the
traffic
moving
and
also
that
the
trial
de
novo
system
used
in
kentucky,
is
outside
the
guidelines
set
down
in
north
carolina
versus
pearce
and
the
state
and
the
accused
should
be
started
at
parity
in
a
trial
de
novo
system.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
in
this
case,
that
we
need
to
go
back
to
the
facts
and
on
this
day
trooper
miller,
the
trooper
who
stopped
the
mendez
car.
his
chief
duties
were
to
keep
the
access
road
to
the
airport
free
and
clear
of
traffic
and
to
keep
traffic
moving
on.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
state
police,
all
the
officers
involved
in
the
--
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
yes,
sir,
captain
state
police.
his
commanding
officer
captain
mayes
testified
that
he
gave
verbal
instructions
as
to
the
security,
the
traffic
flow
not
letting
it
by
stop
on
the
road.
i
think
this
is
normal
precautions
when
you
have
a
dignitary
visiting.
and
trooper
miller
pulled
mendez's
car
over
solely,
because
it
had
an
expired
license
plate.
there
was
no
cause
for
colten
to
stop,
but
he
did.
he
got
out
of
his
car,
he
proceeded
up
and
asked
trooper
miller,
why
he
had
stopped
the
mendez
car.
trooper
miller
explained
to
him
why
he
had
done
this
that
the
license
plate
was
expired,
then
asked
him
to
please
leave,
as
it
was
none
of
his
concern.
colten's
reply
was,
no
i
want
to
stay
around
and
see,
what's
going
to
happen.
and
he
keeps
badgering
and
trooper
miller
is
worried.
he
became
obnoxious
to
the
point
that
trooper
miller
had
to
return
to
his
cruiser
in
order
to
fill
out
the
ticket.
captain
mayes
(ph)
was
the
next
car
to
stop,
the
next
police
car
to
stop.
he
came
up
and
tapped
on
trooper
miller's
car
and
asked
him,
what
the
problem
was
and
did
he
have
these
people
stop?
trooper
miller
replied,
no
i
have
asked
him
to
leave,
i
don't
have
him
stopped.
and
captain
mayes
said,
well
i
just
want
to
check
and
then
he
proceeded
along
with,
i
believe
it
was
lieutenant
maverley
(ph)
who
was
in
his
car
proceeded
to
get
out,
and
expressed
general
directions
to
the
crowd,
to
please
disperse,
to
leave,
and
he
testified
that
he
saw
appellant
in
the
crowd
that
he
addressed
this,
these
comments
to.
by
this
time
there
were
some
six
to
ten
cars
which
colten
himself
testified
were
part
of
the
procession.
that
had
gone
to
the
airport
together
and
were
leaving
together.
and
people
were
getting
out
of
their
cars,
they
were
standing
in
the
roadway.
the
police
cars
were
forced
to
park
on
the
roadway.
and
i
think
that
the
access
road
must
be
understood,
it
is
only
a
two
lane
road.
it
is
not
very
wide,
there
are
fences
on
either
side
of
it.
there
was
testimony,
that
there
were
no
parking
signs
on
the
other
side
of
the
road,
now
today
there
are
no
parking
signs
on
both
sides
of
the
road.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
i
think
that
the
gravel
portion
of
the
shoulder
was
estimated
at
two
feet.
i
don't
think
there
is
an
actual
width
estimated,
it's
about
18
to
20
feet
wide.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
immediately
to
the
right.
colten
testified
that
trooper
harlow
when
he
grabbed
him
by
the
arm
pushed
him
up
against
the
fence.
so
it's
not
more
than
i
would
say
8
to
10
feet
from
the
shoulder
to
the
fence,
at
a
distance.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
i
don't
think
the
record
shows
a
distance,
a
firm
distance
and
the
only
thing
i
can
give
is
an
approximation
from
my
own
recollection.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
off
the
road.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
well
there
is
testimony.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
pardon.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
colten
stopped
his
car
off
the
road
behind
trooper
miller's
car.
then
captain
mayes
pulled
his
car
up
on
the
surface
almost
abreast
with
trooper
miller's,
the
back
of
trooper
miller's.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
colten
was
standing
in
the
road
while
talking
to
trooper
miller.
now,
he
was
up
by
mendez's
car
and
there
was
disputed
testimony
as
to
which.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
there
is
disputed
testimony,
his
testimony
is
that
he
was
standing
by
the
right
front
fender
and
the
officers
testified
that
he
was
variously
in
the
road
and
off
the
road
and
walking
around
the
car.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
well
they
parked
off
the
shoulder
and
in
front
of
mendez's
car
and
behind
the
police
cars
had
stopped
--
three
more
police
cars.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
no
your
honor.
the
police
cars
--
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
the
police
cars
were
in
the
roadway.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
that
and
the
crowd
was
in
the
roadway.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
well,
it
was
15,
approximately
12
to
15
to
18
people.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
the
testimony,
depending
on
which
side
you
look
at
it,
puts
them
in
the
roadway
or
on
the
right
side
of
the
car,
some
of
them
still
in
the
cars.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
well,
the
--
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
no,
no
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
the
trooper
miller
had
his
light
flashing,
he
had
a
person
sitting
in
the
car,
there
was
car
in
front
of
him,
a
car
in
behind
of
him,
captain
mayes
got
out
of
his
car
and
asked
him,
what's
going
on.
he
said,
i
have
got
this
car
stopped
for
a
traffic
violation
and
captain
mayes
said,
are
these
people
needed,
are
they
important
or
what
are
these
other
people
doing?
and
trooper
miller
said,
i
don't
know,
i
have
asked
him
to
leave,
i
don't
have
him
stopped.
and
by
this
time
more
people
were
getting
out
of
their
cars
and
captain
mayes
proceeded
to
attempt
to
clear
the
roadway.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
well
after
captain
mayes
told
the
crowd
some
four
or
five
times
to
please
leave,
trooper
brown
got
at,
was
third
state
policeman
in
line,
he
got
out
and
asked
colten
two
times
to
leave
and
he
kept
telling
him,
i
am
going
to
stay
around
and
see
what
happens.
and
finally
trooper
harlow
came
up
to
colten
and
said
are
you
going
to
leave?
and
he
said,
yes
i
am
going
to
leave,
but
i
want
to
see
what
happens
first.
and
then
he
grabbed
him
by
the
arm
and
he
says,
now
are
you
going
to
leave?
he
said,
yes,
but
i
want
to
see
what
happens
first
and
then
he
arrested
him
for
--
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
i
don't
personally
know
why
he
grabbed
him
by
the
arm.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
i
don't
think
he
denied
it.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
i
don't
know
that
he
hit
him
your
honor.
i
think
he
grabbed
him
by
his
arm
and
was
walking
towards
the
police
wagon
and
i
think
that's
why
they
went
up
against
the
fence.
maybe
colten
was
back
and
away
from
him,
i
don't
--
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
no
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
and
i
think
that
in
this
case
where
we
have
got
to
apply
the
standards
of
vagueness
and
over
breadth
to
the
actual
facts
and
appellant
has
made
much
of
the
fact
that
he
feels
his
speech,
freedom
of
speech
and
freedom
of
assembly
was
tightened.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
standing
for
him
to
allege
that.
i
don't
think
that
he
has
any
freedom
of
assembly,
freedom
of
speech
in
this
case.
the
police
were
merely
trying
to
clear
the
roadway.
they
were
not
prosecuting
appellant,
he
has
made
much
all
the
way
up
here
about
his
appearance
and
the
fact
that
the
police
may
have
been
down
on
him.
but
i
think
that
the
exact
opposite
can
be
assumed
from
this
record
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
they
told
him
ten
times
to
please
leave.
now,
it
seems
absurd
that
he
didn't
understand
them,
that
he
didn't
realize
that
they
were
asking
him
to
leave
and
several
police
officers
testified
that
they
asked
him
please
to
leave.
and
he
even
states
on
his
direct
examination
that
i
know
better
than
to
interfere
with
the
police
officer
in
whatever
he
was
doing.
so
i
hadn't
said
a
word
to
the
police
officer.
now,
this
is
in
contrast
of
the
testimony
of
trooper
miller
who
says
that
colten
comes
up
and
he
has
asked
him
why
he
has
stopped
the
car
and
he
is
asked
to
leave.
now,
the
statute
on
its
face,
made
me
divide
it
into
three
parts.
the
first
part
is
was
their
intent
to
call
this
any
public
inconvenience,
annoyance
or
alarm
or
recklessly
create
a
risk
thereof.
now,
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
great
alarm
here,
any
great
annoyance,
no
tremendous
inconvenience.
but,
the
fact
that
mrs.
nixon
was
at
the
airport,
one
may
assume
that
there
was
a
fairly
substantial
crowd,
as
well-wishers
wishing
mrs.
nixon
a
happy
trip
back
and
that
they
were
leaving
the
airport
at
this
time.
now,
when
you
take
six
cars
and
pull
them
off
on
a
shoulder
and
three
police
cars
in
the
roadway,
so
that
only
one
lane
is
open,
you
severely
congested
the
traffic.
now,
the
main
objective
of
police
was
they
want
to
break
it
up,
they
weren't
trying
to
arrest
anybody,
they
weren't
looking
to
bust
anybody,
they
just
wanted
to
get
the
traffic
moving.
and
i
think
the
intent
is
clear
by
colten's
stopping,
by
his
continued
refusal
to
leave.
now,
second
part
of
the
statute
is
did
he
congregate
with
others
in
a
public
place?
i
think
there
is
ample
testimony
in
the
record
that
crowd
was
estimated
from
12
to
approximately
18
people
that
they
were
standing
in
the
roadway.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
no
your
honor.
there
were
testimony
from
i
believe
5-9
policeman
different
--
there
were
four
state
--
five
state
troopers
there,
four
of
them
testified
at
the
circuit
court
trial.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
the
defense
or
the
civilian
cars
were
estimated
between
6
and
10
and
there
were
three
state
police
vehicles
and
there
has
to
have
been
a
county
police
vehicle
because
it
was
a
county
police
(inaudible),
now
that
one
came
up
later.
so
there
were
approximately
9
or
10
vehicles
there
with
3
of
them
being
state
police
cars.
and
a
public
place
is
--
a
highway
is
a
public
place,
any
place
that
the
public
travels
is
defined
as
a
public
place
and
finally
we
have
to
look
and
see
did
he
violate
a
lawful
order
of
the
police
to
disperse.
now,
the
order
of
the
police
must
be
lawful
and
i
submit
that
in
this
case
the
fact
that
they
were
trying
to
clear
the
road
of
traffic
to
provide
a
free
moving
flow
of
traffic
that
by
necessity
made
this
a
lawful
order
that
the
police
have
autonomous
control
of
traffic.
that's
one
of
their
primary
responsibilities,
as
regulation
and
enforcement.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
serves
both,
it
is
an
entrance
and
an
exit
from
the
airport
and
other
than
a
road
that
winds
through
a
park
going
out
the
back
way,
it's
the
only
entrance
to
the
lexington
blue
grass
airport.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
no
your
honor,
there
is
no
testimony
to
that
effect.
there
is
testimony
by
the
officers
at
the
traffic
at
that
time
was
very
heavy
and
the
defense
has
testified
that
there
was
no
traffic
on
the
road
at
that
time.
finally,
the
third
part
of
the
statute,
i
think
it's
clear
that
colten
refused
to
disperse
after
being
so
asked.
now,
this
statute
kentucky
disorderly
conduct
statute
is
very
similar
to
the
statute
in
the
shuttleworth
case.
there
the
regulation
had
to
do
with
regulating
flow
on
a
side
wall,
but
the
wording
is
essentially
the
same
and
in
that
case
the
alabama
supreme
court
interpreted
the
alabama
statute,
so
as
to
make
it
constitutional
and
i
think
in
this
case
the
kentucky
legislature
enacted
this
disorderly
conduct
statute
based
on
a
statute
similar
to
the
shuttleworth
case,
so
as
to
make
it
constitutional.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
when
he
was
physically
placed
under
arrest
he
was
on
the
right
side
of
the
cars
that
had
pulled
off
the
road.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
your
honor
he
wandered
all
over.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
by
which
officer
your
honor,
he
was
told
by
--
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
ten
times.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
at
least
ten
times.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
i
believe
the
record
will
show
that
he
was
standing
at
the
right
rear
fender
of
the
mendez
vehicle.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
the
mendez
vehicle
was
off
the
road.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
he
was
standing
by
the
right
rear
fender
of
the
car,
the
car
was
off
the
road.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
no
sir,
he
wasn't
out
in
the
street
at
the
time
trooper
harlow
arrested
him.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
i
think
it
would
your
honor.
in
regard
to
the
increase
in
punishment
from
the
fayette
quarterly
court
to
the
fayette
circuit
court,
i
think
that
the
pearce
decision
as
set
forth
in
the
opinion
applies
to
retrials,
a
case
where
a
man
secures
a
reversal
and
there
were
errors
committed
at
the
trial,
he
has
appealed
from
errors.
now
the
spirit
of
pearce
seems
to
be
that
a
person
should
not
be
in
fear
of
following
an
appeal.
i
think
that
the
trial
de
novo
system
should
not
be
governed
by
that,
because
here
there
are
no
errors
appealed
from
the
judgment,
the
sentence,
the
plea,
the
evidence
and
nothing
that
is
introduced
at
the
quarterly
court.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
no
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
i
think
it
was
more
thorough
in
the
circuit
court,
i
think
there
were
more
witnesses
other
than
the
fact
that
i
think.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
no
your
honor
you
must
bring
your
own
(inaudible)
in
if
you
wish
to
transcript.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
no
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
$10
in
the
quarterly
court.
now,
there
was
nothing
used
in
the
circuit
court.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
i
am
sure
they
did,
mrs.
wilson
in
her
closing
argument
mentioned
the
$10
fine
in
the
lower
court.
so
whether
he
knew
it
from
any
other
source
or
not
i
am
sure
he
got
it
from
that.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
no
your
honor,
there
is
no
explanation
of
why
he
increased
it
from
10
to
$50.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
and
i
think
that
is
to
show
if
there
is
a
lack
of
any
vindictiveness
or
that
he
is
applying
a
penalty
for
the
--
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
because
i
think
this
is
a
whole
new
ball
game.
as
i
say
in
kentucky
a
man
could
walk
in
and
plead
guilty
and
say
your
honor
i
am
sorry,
i
didn't
mean
to
do
that
and
--
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
right
and
he
could
all
for
mitigating
circumstances
and
receive
a
suspended
sentence
and
to
require
the
circuit
court
to
try
a
man
later
on
the
same
case
on
a
not
a
guilty
plea
and
then
be
unable
to
impose
any
punishment
whatsoever,
defeats
the
whole
purpose
of
the
trial
de
novo
system.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
six
months
and
$500.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
bell
case;
i
am
not
familiar
with
that
other
than
i
have
seen
the
brief
in
the
case.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
in
the
circuit
court
they
would
have
been
banned
by
the
constitution
to
give
him
a
jury
trial,
yet,
expressly
by
state
constitution
and
statute.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
it
must
be
expressed
as
a
waive
from
the
circuit
court.
but
the
purpose
of
the
quarterly
court
is
to
serve
as
a
court
of
convenience.
that's
where
any
traffic
tickets
or
any
misdemeanors.
i
would
say
that
85%
of
the
cases
are
guilty
pleas
which
rather
government
said
were
disposed
off
five
minutes,
ten
minutes
if
that
long.
the
majority
of
the
lower
courts,
adjuncts
on
the
county
court
system,
the
commissioners
or
the
judges
are
not
lawyers.
in
lexington
we
are
fortunate
to
have
a
judge
as
a
commissioner
of
the
quarterly
court.
but
they
just
merely
provide
an
outlet
for
speedy
administration
of
justice.
now
if
a
person
wishes
a
full
bond
trial,
he
can
either
go
through
a
short
trial
in
quarterly
court
or
he
may
plea
guilty
and
then
just
walk
out
the
door
and
around
the
quarter
and
file
for
his
trial
de
novo
in
the
circuit
clerk's
office.
i
think
that
approximately
half
the
states
employee
have
trial
de
novo
system.
some
are
tending
to
lean
away
from
it,
some
are
adhering
to
it
and
i
think
that
to
hold
that
the
trial
de
novo
system
is
under
the
guidelines
of
north
carolina
versus
pearce
would
severely
hamper
this
system.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
but
i
think
that
in
a
trial
de
novo
system
that
it
is
essential
that
the
state
and
the
accused
start
out
at
parity,
that
you
are
hamstringing
the
prosecution,
if
there
is
a
very
low
fine
or
a
suspended
sentence
or
a
probated
sentence.
the
prosecutor
is
not
going
to
want
to
try
a
case
where
even
a
jury
cannot
impose
any
punishment
and
this
is
either
going
to
force
the
quarterly
court
out
of
existence
except
to
hear
maybe
guilty
pleas
or
it's
going
to
result
in
the
quarterly
court
hanging
down
the
maximum
sentences.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
i
think
that
that
should
be
a
distinguishing
characteristic.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
sometimes
they
act
as
an
examining
trial
or
preliminary
act.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
i
think
they
are
limited
to
below
12
months
and
--
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
in
my
personal
experience,
no,
not
in
cases
like
this.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
it
isn't
for
first
defenders.
now,
where
the
government
will
reside
again
to
the
bell
case.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
six
months
and
$500
fine.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
so
in
conclusion,
i
would
say
that
the
appellant
has
no
standing
to
question,
the
constitutionality
of
the
disorderly
conduct
statute
of
kentucky.
he
was
not
engaged
to
any
protective
activity.
he
was
disrupting
traffic,
he
was
asked
to
leave
by
four
policemen
ten
times.
they
were
not
picking
on
him,
they
just
wanted
to
get
the
traffic
moving
and
also
that
the
trial
de
novo
system
used
in
kentucky,
is
outside
the
guidelines
set
down
in
north
carolina
versus
pearce
and
the
state
and
the
accused
should
be
started
at
parity
in
a
trial
de
novo
system.
thank
you.
