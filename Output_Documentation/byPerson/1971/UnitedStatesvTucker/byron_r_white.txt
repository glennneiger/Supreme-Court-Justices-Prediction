was
that
a
plea
of
guilty?
justice
byron

white
what
did
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
say
just
referring
to
the
two?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
you
not
think
it
makes
a
real
difference
in
this
case
where
your
argument
is
to
whether
the
prior
convictions
at
issue
were
pleads
of
guilty
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
he
deny
the
--
did
he
deny
the
previous
convictions
or
the
crimes
at
the
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
he
not
only
did
not
deny
the
underlying
conduct,
but
he
admitted
(voice

justice
byron

white
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
that
be
the
entire
record
and
lodged
here
in
the
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
are
official
records
in
the
(voice

justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
did
not
send
them
up?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
that
appear
in
the
form
of
an
order?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it
must
have
been
an
item
on
the
docket
of
the
court?
i
mean,
there
must
have
been
a
docket
entry
of
an
order?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
do
not
mean
to
suggest
that
without
it,
you
should
lose
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
suggest
if
coming
out
the
same
judge
to
try
to
give
the
sentence
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
he
is
not?
say
he
is
off
the
bench,
he
is
deceased,
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
would
not
you
just
set
aside
the
sentence
and
send
it
back
to
a
sentencing
court
for
re-sentencing
before
whatever
--
whoever,
whatever
judge
is
available?
justice
byron
r.
white
no.
why
would
not
the
--
let
assume
a
2255
judge
finds
that
the
un-counseled
priors
were
used,
why
should
not
he
set
it
aside
and
require
re-sentencing,
if
the
prior
judge
is
not
available?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
would
not
re-sentencing
just
in
the
2255
proceedings,
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
to
get
up
the
--
i
suppose
you
have
to
have
sentencing
hearing
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
he
had
not
been
on
that
opinion,
how
could
he
have
denied
the
motion?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
on
that
--
let
us
assume
that
he
just
said
petition
for
rehearing
denied.
how
could
he
deny
that
without
saying
this
would
not
have
made
any
difference
anyway?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
do
not
require
on
judges
passing
on
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession.
the
confession
is
on
in
--
if
they
say,
just
denied,
it
is
voluntary,
we
do
not
require
any
exposition
and
townsend
case
says
we
will
--
if
a
man
gives
a
clear
ruling,
a
kind
of
ruling,
he
is
supposed
to
give,
yes
or
no,
you
assume
regularity
of
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
seems
to
have
subject
to
fresno,
california?
justice
byron
r.
white
these
were
the
california
proceedings
relating
to
conduct
after
the
conduct
for
which
he
is
not

justice
byron

in
any
event

justice
byron

when
he
was

during
the
trail
at
sentence
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
was
convicted
after
sentencing
here.
he
was
convicted
in
the
california
courts?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
he
is
on
probation
--
he
never
served
any
time
there,
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
this
back
in
1953
when
the
procedures
may
have
been
in
the
county
were
a
little
different.
all
of

he

him(voice

all
i
wanted
to
know
is
he
under

not?

he

did
i
understand
that

prison
today,
he
would
be
still
on
probation
from

justice
