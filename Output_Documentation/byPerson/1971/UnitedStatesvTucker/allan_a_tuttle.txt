mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
question
of
the
propriety
of
the
use
in
a
1953
sentencing
hearing
and
sentencing
proceeding
of
records
of
prior
convictions,
in
1938,
1946,
and
possibly
1950,
which
were
obtained
in
the
absence
of
counsel
or
alleged
to
have
been
obtained
in
the
absence
of
counsel.
tucker
was
convicted
in
1953
of
the
robbery
of
the
federally
insured
savings
and
loan
association.
he
was
convicted
in
the
united
state’s
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
california.
now,
the
evidence
in
the
case
which
consisted
of
four
eye
witnesses
and
fingerprint
evidence
and
testimony
is
concededly
overwhelming
and
the
validity
of
his
conviction
and
the
strength
of
the
evidence
against
him
is
not
challenged
in
this
proceeding
or
before
this
court.
tucker
took
the
stand
in
his
own
defense
in
these
proceedings,
in
that
trial
and
he
was
cross
examined
with
respect
to
certain
prior
state
felony
convictions.
he
was
cross
examined
with
respect
to
and
admitted
a
1938
conviction
for
theft
of
an
automobile.
he
was
cross
examined
and
admitted
a
1946
jewelry
store
robbery
in
louisiana.
he
was
cross
examined
with
respect
to
and
admitted
a
conviction
for
armed
robbery
in
1950.
he
was
shortly
thereafter
convicted
of
the
crime
of
robbery
of
a
federally
insured
savings
and
loan
association.
thereafter,
the
judge,
the
trial
court
conducted
a
sentencing
hearing
at
which
it
took
evidence
with
respect
to
the
defendant
tucker.
with
respect
to
these
convictions
which
i
have
mentioned,
certain
further
evidence
was
brought
out.
it
was
brought
out
with
respect
to
the
1938
automobile
theft
conviction
that
he
had
served
seven
of
the
10
years
which
had
been
imposed.
with
respect
to
the
1946
jewelry
store
burglary
that
he
had
served
45
months
out
of
a
four-year
sentence,
and
with
respect
to
the
1950
armed
robbery
conviction,
that
he
had
served
no
time
because
he
escaped
after
a
sentence
of
five
years
was
imposed.
other
information
with
respect
to
the
defendant
was
also
brought
out.
it
was
brought
out
for
instance
that
he
was
under
indictment
in
the
los
angeles
for
another
federal
armed
bank
robbery,
which
was
to
precede
the
trial
immediately
after
the
sentencing.
it
was
brought
out
that
he
was
a
suspect
in
four
other
federal
bank
robberies
and
seven
or
eight
armed
robberies
of
local
savings
and
loan
associations
in
the
san
francisco
area
and
the
evidence
with
respect
tot
those
robberies
was
elicited,
that
is
to
say
that
there
was
evidence,
eye
witness
testimony
and
fingerprint
testimonies
with
respect
to
those
other
charges
and
investigations
against
the
defendant
tucker.
tucker
was
sentenced
to
the
maximum
permissible
term
under
the
statute
providing
for
armed
bank
robbery
of
the
federally
insured
bank,
which
is
25
years.
now,
later
on
in
the
same
year,
the
state
of
california
brought
proceedings
against
tucker
for
armed
robbery
and
he
was
convicted
of
four
arm
robberies
under
california
law.
this
proceeding
occurred
under
the
california
recidivist
statute,
so
that
the
indictment
on
that
case
charged
to
four
arm
robberies
and
in
addition
charged
two
of
the
three
prior
felony
convictions
i
have
mentioned,
the
1938
auto
theft
and
a
1946
jewelry
store
burglary.
following
this
court’s
decision
in
gideon
versus
wainwright,
tucker
successfully
attacked,
first
his
habitual
offender
status
in
california
and
later
on
the
underlying
california
convictions
for
armed
robbery
on
the
ground
that
the
use
of
those
two
priors
had
been
prejudicial
in
as
much
as
he
had
not
had
counsel
in
1938,
and
he
had
not
counsel
in
1946.
now,
following
the
state
court’s
vacation
of
those
two
prior;
1938
and
1946
convictions,
that
is
to
say
its
finding
that
there
had
been
no
counsel,
tucker
brought
a
motion
under
2255,
attacking
the
conviction
which
is
the
subject
of
this
case,
the
bank
robbery
conviction,
alleging
that
the
use
in
cross
examination
of
those
two
priors
which
were
concededly
on
counsel
and
also
alleging
that
the
use
of
the
1950
conviction
which
had
theretofore
not
been
challenged
as
counseled
or
un-counseled,
had
prejudiced
him
when
it
was
used
for
cross
examination
and
impeachment
purposes.
now,
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
both
found
that
the
use
of
un-counseled
priors
was
improper,
but
they
found
that
the
error
was
harmless
because
of
the
overwhelming
evidence
against
the
defendant
in
the
case.
the
court
of
appeals,
however,
found
further
that
those
priors
had
been
used
at
the
sentencing
hearing
and
at
the
sentencing
hearing,
the
judge
might
possibly
have
relied
upon
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
reliance
could
not
be
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
under
chapman
and
remanded
the
case
for
re-sentencing
without
the
use
or
reliance
upon
the
un-counseled
prior
convictions.
therefore,
the
case
is
before
this
court
now,
at
the
request
of
the
united
states
to
determine
whether
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
remanding
that
case
for
re-consideration
of
sentence.
the
question
which
this
court,
this
case
presents
in
this
court
is
whether
a
particular
rule
of
evidence,
specifically
an
exclusionary
rule
of
evidence,
should
be
applied
to
sentencing
proceedings,
so
as
to
deprive
the
sentencing
judge
of
knowledge
or
reliance
upon
prior
convictions
which
were
obtained
without
the
assistance
of
counsel
prior
to
gideon.
now,
it
seems
to
be
common
ground
among
all
the
parties
in
this
case,
that
a
judge
should
have
access
to
and
should
be
entitled
to
rely
upon
all
reliable,
relevant
information
concerning
a
defendant’s
character,
background,
habits
or
dispositions
which
can
be
brought
before
the
sentencing
judge.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
the
1938
auto
theft
conviction
was
a
plea
of
guilty.
in
1946
burglary
store
robbery
was
a
plea
of
guilty.
before
this
morning,
i
have
been
of
the
impression
that
the
1950
sentence
--
the
1950
conviction
had
not
been
challenged.
within
the
hour,
mr.
reppy
showed
me
a
copy
of
the
2255
motion
in
district
court,
which
was
not
made
part
of
the
record
certified
to
this
court
which
indicates
they
also
challenged
the
1950
conviction.
now,
the
19
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
i
believe
it
was,
but
i
simply
do
not
know
because
i
had
thought
that
that
conviction
was
not
being
challenged
before
this
court.
we
are
informed
by
the
clerk
of
the
dade
county
court
because
we
inquired
with
respect
to
this,
that
petitioner
did
have
counsel
during
the
1950
proceeding.
i
should
say
that
the
respondent
tucker
alleges
in
his
brief
that
he
did
not
have
counsel.
that
question
was
never
decided
mr.
justice
white
because
that
1950
conviction
was
not
one
of
the
two
priors
that
was
alleged
in
the
california
recidivist
prosecution,
and
therefore,
not
one
of
the
priors
with
respect
to
what
you
are
hearing
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
the
court
--
the
district
court
simply
held
that
the
use
of
priors,
un-counseled
priors
without
making
specific
findings,
but
acknowledging
the
united
states'
admission
with
respect
to
the
36,
38
and
46
priors
that
they
were
un-counseled,
said
that
the
use
of
un-counseled
priors
in
cross
examination
would
be
bad.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
i
do
not
think
that
that
is
a
dispositive
consideration
mr.
justice
white.
i
know
that
the
two,
38
and
46
were
pleas
of
guilty.
as
i
said,
i
have
believed
until
today
that
the
1950
conviction
what
not
being
challenged
at
all.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
at
the
trial,
and
i
think
this
is
quite
significant,
he
neither
denied
the
convictions
nor
as
i
want
to
say
with
respect
to
the
1938
and
1946
convictions,
he
not
only
did
not
deny
those
convictions,
he
admitted
those
convictions,
but
he
want
further,
he
admitted
the
underlying
conduct.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
he
affirmatively
admitted
the
underlying
conduct
and
i
think
that
insofar
as
there
might
be
a
question
about
the
reliability
of
un-counseled
convictions,
this
cannot
be
considered
in
this
--
in
the
facts
of
this
case.
i
call
the
court’s
attention
to
page
24
of
the
appendix.
with
respect
to
the
1938
automobile
theft,
the
question
about
that
conviction,
answer,
“it
boils
down
to
this.
i
was
17
years
old,
broke
into
a
man’s
garage,
took
his
automobile,
went
joyriding
in
it,
and
received
a
10-year
sentence
for
it.”
so,
he
admits
the
conduct.
he
says
it
was
joyriding,
but
he
admits
he
took
the
car
and
went
from
the
man’s
garage.
with
respect
to
the
1946
jewelry
store
burglary,
again
on
page
24,
“i
broke
into
a
jewelry
store”
and
on
page
24
where
new
orleans,
question;
day
or
night;
answer
“at
night.”
so,
that
with
respect
to
those
two
convictions,
the
question
of
whether
counsel
--
whether
the
absence
of
counsel
makes
the
conviction
unreliable
does
not
appear
before
this
court.
with
respect
to
the
1950
conviction,
the
record
as
at
now
stands
indicates
that
there
has
been
no
determination;
first
of
all,
whether
was
counsel
or
not,
no
judicial
determination.
we
have
made
inquiries
and
we
have
been
told
and
we
recite
in
our
brief
that
the
dade
county
clerk
indicates
to
us
that
counsel
was
supplied.
the
respondent
tucker
in
his
brief
says
that
he
did
not
have
counsel
and
there
has
been
no
determination
of
that
fact,
but
we
submit
that
it
seems
to
us
that
all
of
the
considerations
of
modern
criminology,
calling
for
the
individuation
of
punishment
require
that
a
sentencing
judge
have
all
relevant
information
before
him,
which
will
help
him
in
determining
that
punishment,
and
that
what
include
evidence
of
un-counseled
convictions.
the
application
of
ordinary
rules
of
evidence
or
in
particular
an
exclusionary
rule
of
evidence
to
the
sentencing
proceedings,
would
it
seems
to
us
to
deprive
the
judge
a
valuable
information
concerning
a
defendant’s
background,
a
defendant’s
character
and
dispositions.
now,
in
williams
versus
new
york,
this
court
specifically
refused
to
apply
ordinary
rules
of
evidence,
the
sentencing
proceedings
and
specifically
recognized
that
the
application
of
ordinary
rules
of
evidence
would
frustrate
the
purpose
of
individuation
of
punishment.
you
will
recall
that
in
williams,
the
judge
had
to
report
that
the
defendant
was
involved
in
some
30
other
burglaries,
in
addition
to
the
murder
which
was
the
charge
in
the
indictment.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
just
hearsay
information,
your
honor
and
this
court
and
the
judge
relied
upon
it,
said
he
relied
upon
it,
acknowledged
that
there
had
been
no
convictions
resulting
from
those
report
of
the
other
burglaries
and
as
you
recall
sentenced
william
to
death.
now,
in
this
case
also,
the
sentencing
judge
had
before
him
substantial
information
concerning
this
defendant’s
criminal
activity
which
had
not
resulted
in
a
conviction
un-counseled
or
not
or
an
indictment.
there
was
the
allegation
that
this
defendant
had
been
involved
in
four
federal
bank
robberies,
the
allegation
that
he
had
been
involved
in
7
or
8
armed
robberies
of
savings
and
loan
institutions
and
the
sentencing
judge
was
told
by
the
witness,
he
was
examining
out
for
this
purpose
that
the
evidence
was
substantial,
that
it
was
substantial
and
the
same
as
it
had
been
in
this
trial,
that
is
eye
witness
testimony
and
fingerprint
testimony.
and
the
use
of
that
information,
which
is
allegation
of
criminal
conduct,
falling
short
of
a
conviction
counseled
or
not,
is
not
challenged
in
this
court.
it
seems
to
us
that
it
would
be
ironical,
if
it
were
proper
for
a
court
to
rely
upon
such
hearsay
information
as
mr.
chief
justice
describes
it,
rely
upon
that
information
in
the
assessment
of
sentence
and
yet
would
be
deprived
of
reliance
on
the
same
information
when
it
matured
into
a
conviction,
merely
because
the
conviction
was
un-counseled.
now,
we
know
in
this
case
that
there
is
no
doubt
that
tucker
committed
the
1938
and
the
1946
violations
because
he
admitted
that
he
did,
but
we
submit
that
even
un-counseled
convictions
where
had
been
no
such
admissions
are
no
more
unreliable,
then
much
of
the
evidence
which
is
historically
and
traditionally
been
considered
proper
for
a
sentencing
judge
to
rely
upon.
we
also
would
point
out
to
this
court
that
the
use
of
un-counseled
convictions
in
this
context
has
some
evidence
of
criminality
on
the
part
of
the
defendant,
is
totally
different
from
the
use
of
such
convictions
under
ordinary
recidivist
statutes.
there,
the
prior
convictions
automatically
increase
the
exposure
or
increase
the
mandatory
minimum
and
it
is
the
fact
of
conviction
that
creates
automatically
a
harsher
sentence
and
in
that
case
we
submit,
the
conviction
operates
to
deprive
the
judge
of
discretion
with
a
mandatory
increase
in
sentence.
whereas
the
information
here,
the
un-counseled
conviction
and
the
information
suggests
is
merely
being
used
to
inform
the
discretion
of
the
court
to
give
the
most
intelligent
individual
treatment
to
a
particular
offender.
for
this
reason,
we
think
that
this
court’s
holding
in
burgett
versus
texas
has
no
application
to
the
facts
at
bar.
now,
quite
apart
from
the
question
of
whether
a
sentencing
judge
should
be
permitted
to
rely
upon
un-counseled
convictions,
the
law
seems
clear
that
a
sentencing
judge
can
rely
upon
the
conduct,
which
underly
conviction
and
any
competent
evidence
of
this
criminal
conduct,
any
reports
of
this
conduct
would
be
permissible
information
for
the
judge
to
use,
even
if
he
could
not
rely
upon
the
fact
that
the
conviction
itself.
and
we
submit
that
any
rule
which
would
exclude
the
reliance
upon
such
conduct,
falling
short
of
a
conviction,
would
deprive
the
judge
of
much
valuable
information
which
courts
have
traditionally,
historically
and
properly
relied
upon.
a
charge
might
be
dropped
because
the
prosecuting
witness
did
not
appear,
or
it
might
be
dropped
as
an
exercise
of
prosecutorial
discretion
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
that
it
--
i
think
that
is
an
important
distinction,
your
honor.
there
are
cases,
even
sentencing
cases
where
suppressed
evidence
has
not
been
used
or
permitted
to
be
used
as
information
before
the
sentencing
judge
and
the
rationale
of
those
cases
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
whole
deterrent
rationale
of
the
perspective
application
of
math.
the
theory
of
the
courts
that
forbid
the
use
of
illegally
seized
evidence
in
a
sentencing
hearing
suggests
that
if
it
were
permitted,
a
prosecutor
or
the
police
could
deprive
an
individual,
would
be
encouraged,
if
they
have
enough
evidence
to
seize
a
person
for
a
narrowed
crime,
would
be
encouraged
to
engage
in
rampant
searches
thereafter,
figuring
that
once
they
could
convict
him
of
the
narrow
crime,
they
could
put
in
everything
else
on
the
sentencing
hearing
and
obtain
a
maximum
sentence.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
i
am
sorry?
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
that
is
--
there
is
a
circuit
course
--
circuit
court
case.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
your
honor,
if
the
case
is
a
(voice
overlap)
vertigo.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
and,
i
--
i
cannot
tell
you
that
the
circuit,
but
it
is
cited
in
the
respondent’s
brief,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
rationale,
the
deterrent
rationale
which
would
prohibit
the
use
of
that
evidence
all
be
in
significant
evidence
is
distinguishable
from
this
case
where
we
are
only
concerned
about
the
issue
of
reliability.
it
is
common
place
in
pre-sentence
reports,
for
instance,
for
a
probation
officer
or
the
prosecutor
in
talking
to
probation
officer,
to
try
and
put
the
defendant
in
a
context
of
criminality
which
may
not
be
revealed
by
the
indictment
of
the
trial
itself
to
give
the
sentencing
judge
some
idea
of
this
person’s
place
in
an
entire
criminal
scheme.
that
kind
of
information
has
always
been
included
in
pre-sentence
reports,
but
it
is
information
that
may
enhance
punishment
and
it
is
not
sworn,
and
it
is
not
usually
subject
to
cross
examination,
and
yet
it
is
information
which
we
feel
ought
properly
to
be
before
the
sentencing
court.
further,
even
regardless
of
the
reliability
of
the
conviction,
it
seems
to
us
that
incarcerations
that
result
as
a
basis
of
--
as
a
result
of
un-counseled
convictions
are
information
which
a
sentencing
judge
should
have
before
him.
the
court
will
notice
in
this
case,
at
the
age
of
17,
tucker
is
convicted
of
auto
theft.
he
is
sentenced
to
10
years
in
jail.
he
stays
in
jail
till
mid
1945.
released
in
mid
1945,
he
is
probably
convicted
again
in
1946,
stays
in
jail
for
mid
19
--
from
1946
until
mid
1949.
released
in
the
middle
of
1949,
he
probably
commits
an
armed
robbery
in
1950.
he
is
sentenced
on
that
and
he
escapes,
but
less
than
a
year
later
in
1951,
he
commits
the
crime
which
is
subject
of
this
case.
thus
from
the
age
of
17
and
from
1938
to
1951,
tucker
spent
the
entire
intervening
period
with
months
exceptions
in
jail.
now,
it
seems
to
us
the
sentencing
judge
could
not
rationally
individuate
the
punishment,
or
the
treatment
of
tucker,
in
ignorance
of
those
facts.
and,
i
think
that
respondent
tucker
really
admits
that
when
he
suggests
that
perhaps
that
information
should
be
before
the
sentencing
judge.
now,
i
think
finally,
your
honor,
there
is
a
--
there
is
no
real
evidence
in
this
case
that
the
sentencing
judge
relied
upon
these
prior
convictions
in
imposing
the
sentence
which
he
did
impose.
the
judge
was
specifically
told
in
this
case
that
tucker
was
a
suspect
in
four
other
robberies,
federal
robberies,
seven
or
eight
other
savings
and
loan
robberies,
and
he
was
told
on
the
strength
of
the
evidence
with
respect
to
those.
he
was
told
about
a
pending
indictment
in
los
angeles.
now,
the
judge
specifically
said
he
would
not
consider
the
pending
indictment
in
los
angeles
because
in
essence,
that
case
would
take
care
of
itself.
it
would
be
a
sentence
appropriate
to
that
offense,
but
his
statements
and
these
occur
at
the
end
of
the
sentencing
hearing,
indicate
the
matters
which
he
truly
relied
upon
and
those
are
these
pending
investigations.
this
occurs
on
page
37
of
the
appendix.
with
the
court’s
permission,
i
will
read
a
few
lines.
“i
take
it,”
this
is
the
court
asking
the
question,
“you
did
not
present
these
cases
until
you
determined
the
fate
of
this
particular
case.
is
that
the
problem
involved?
”the
witness,
who
is
an
fbi
agent,
“well,
these
particular
cases
i
am
talking
about
are
local.
they
are
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
local
police.
there
is
no
federal
jurisdiction.
now,
i
understand
the
district
attorney’s
office
in
alameda
county
is
waiting.
what
action
they
are
going
to
take,
i
do
not
know.”
and
then
the
court,
“i
assume
that
whatever
sentence
is
meted
out
to
the
defendant
in
this
case
at
bar
will
be
considered
in
connection
with
the
prosecution
or
absence
of
prosecution
in
those
cases.”
the
witness,
“i
believe
so.”
the
court,
“alright,
and
then
do
you
have
further
and
promptly
imposes
the
25-year
maximum
sentence”
and
we
submit
that
those
were
the
considerations
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
that
is
an
fbi
agent,
the
man
who
arrested
the
defendant
in
the
first
instance.
i
think
there
is
a
further
indication
of
the
fact
that
these
particular
priors
were
not
relied
upon
by
sentencing
judge
and
that
also
was
only
called
to
my
attention
within
the
last
hour
by
mr.
reppy,
another
document
which
was
not
included
in
the
record
on
appeal,
but
it
is
part
of
the
record
below.
it
appears
that
in
the
2255
motion
originally
made
before
the
district
judge
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
in
this
case,
tucker
challenged
the
convictions
because
of
the
use
of
these
priors
on
cross.
the
judge
said
harmless
error.
tucker
then
moved
and
this
does
not
appear
in
the
appendix
because
it
was
not
certified
to
this
court,
tucker
then
moved
for
a
reconsideration
of
sentence
on
the
ground
of
the
sentencing
judge,
who
incidentally
was
the
same
judge
who
in
1953
had
heard
the
case,
move
for
reconsideration
of
sentence
on
the
grounds
with
the
use
of
priors
at
sentence.
and,
the
judge’s
disposition
of
that
was
preemptory.
he
simply
said
this
raises
no
new
issues
which
would
require
consideration.
therefore,
i
think
that
it
is
clear
that
the
sentencing
judge
in
this
case
did
not
feel
that
those
priors
had
influenced
his
sentencing.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
i
believe
that
it
had
been.
these
are
documents
which
mr.
reppy
obtained,
they
are
copies
of
tucker’s
own
records
and
i
had
not
known
them
to
be
part
of
the
record.
i
am
at
the
moment
relying
upon
the
representation
of
mr.
reppy
that
these
are
official
records
in
the
case
and
they
are
not
part
of
the
record
before
that
was
lodged
in
this
court
because
until
this
moment,
i
did
not
know
they
existed.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
they
are
part
of
the
record
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
in
this
case.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
in
this
case.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
in
this
case,
they
are
simply
not
lodged
in
the
court
because
we
did
know
of
their
existence
until
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
that
appears
to
be
what
happened,
but
i
do
think
that
this
particular
order
is
significant
because
it
shows
that
the
very
sentencing
judge
in
this
case,
who
had
sentenced
this
man
in
1953,
when
he
admits
on
the
subsequent
question
that
the
use
of
the
priors
in
cross
examination
is
bad
and
then
he
says
--
then
the
respondent
says
well,
what
about
the
use
of
them
in
sentencing
and
the
sentencing
judge
says
“that
does
not
call
for
any
further
consideration.”
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
it
appears
in
the
form
of
an
order
denying
a
motion
for
rehearing.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
i
assume
there
would
be
docket
entry
mr.
justice
white.
i
have
been
looking
at
the
record,
if
it
was
docketed
here,
i
did
not
find
that
that
item,
and
i
have
only
learned
of
it
within
the
last
hour,
but
i
do
submit
it
is
of
perhaps
controlling
significance
in
this
case
because
the
question
might
be
as
to
why
not
let
the
judge
take
another
crack
at
it.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
perhaps
i
should
say
mr.
justice
white
(voice
overlap)
it
is
sufficient,
but
not
necessary
for
the
government’s
position.
thank
you.
if
i
have
any
further
time,
i
would
like
to
reserve
it
for
rebuttal.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
first
mr.
chief
justice,
you
asked
the
citation
of
the
vertigo
case
which
related
to
the
use
of
a
evidence
which
had
been
seized
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
that
is
a
ninth
circuit
case,
your
honor,
it
is
402
f.
2d
599.
with
respect
to
petitioner's
contention
that
at
the
sentencing
hearing,
he
protested
innocence
and
he
meant
to
say
“both,”
that
is
to
say
both
the
1938
florida
conviction
for
auto
theft,
and
the
1950
florida
conviction
for
armed
robbery,
as
i
read
the
record
and
i
have
nothing
outside
the
record
to
rely
upon,
it
seems
to
me,
your
honors,
that
what
he
is
saying
with
the
respect
the
auto
theft
is
that
was
a
joyride.
that
was
not
grand
larceny
auto.
i
mean,
i
did
it,
but
it
was
not
a
crime
of
that
magnitude
and
that
is
a
sense
of
innocence
which
he
is
asserting.
now,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
very
briefly
to
this
notion
of
conclusiveness
which
mr.
reppy
has
raised.
there
is
an
extensive
portion
of
the
respondent’s
brief
addressed
to
the
notion
and
to
the
rule
of
law
that
for
certain
purposes
convictions
are
conclusive
evidence
of
guilt
and
that
arises
principally
in
impeachment
proceedings
where
a
person
is
often
not
allowed
to
explain
that
although
i
was
convicted
i
felt
in
fact
guilty.
that
only
arises
in
context
where
rules
of
evidence
supply
and
i
submit
that
importing
conclusiveness
into
sentencing,
a
respondent
commits
the
same
error
that
he
is
attempting
to
do
when
he
wants
to
import
the
rules
of
evidence
into
sentencing
generally.
whereas
we
would
claim
that
the
rules
of
evidence
do
not
apply
and
any
reliable
information
can
be
used,
we
would
maintain
the
same
with
respect
to
any
doctrine
of
conclusiveness.
i
cannot
conceive
of
a
probation
officer,
if
a
defendant
being
examined
by
him
for
the
purpose
of
preparation
of
a
pre-sentence
report
says
“yes,
i
have
the
x
conviction,
the
y
conviction,
but
i
did
not
do
it.
i
did
not
have
an
attorney
or
i
did
not
do
it
or
i
was
under
duress.”
i
think
that
all
of
the
books
which
have
been
collected
in
respondent’s
brief
and
all
of
the
learning
that
the
court
may
find
on
the
subject
of
sentencing
in
preparation
of
pre-sentence
reports
indicates
that
these
gentleman,
the
probation
officers
are
trained
to
be
open
minded
and
train
to
include
everything.
and
i
do
not
think
that
doctrine
of
conclusiveness
would
ever
precluded
a
defendant
in
a
pre-sentence
report
from
alleging
his
innocence
or
circumstances
of
mitigation
and
i
simply
feel
that
conclusiveness
has
not
relevance
in
this
case.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
that
is
correct.
the
--
in
this
case,
it
appears
that
the
judge
required
his
information
orally.
i
was
addressing
myself
to
more
general
problem
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
--
of
whether
conclusiveness
would
create
any
bar.
with
respect
to
matters
that
judge
harris
considered,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
that
very
briefly
because
mr.
justice
white
you
raised
a
question
about
that.
i
think
that
if
you
read
the
record,
it
is
clear
that
he
did
not
rely
upon
the
pending
federal
los
angeles
indictment,
but
that
he
did
rely
upon
the
seven
or
eight
pending
state
investigations,
four
of
which
did
later
in
fact
resulted
in
convictions
and
which
were
later
collaterally
attacked.
so,
i
think
that
his
--
the
things
that
he
did
not
rely
upon
was
the
situation,
where
there
was
indictment
and
in
the
judge's
eyes
the
indictment
was
going
to
take
care
of
itself.
that
there
would
be
a
prosecution
in
appropriate
sentence,
but
as
to
those
pending
state
proceedings,
he
felt
that
the
state
might
prosecute
or
not
prosecute
or
prosecute
some
and
not
others
depending
on
what
happened
at
his
sentencing.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
no,
because
he
was
successful
in
first
attacking
his
habitual
criminal
finding.
that
went
up
to
the
california
supreme
court
and
they
said
if
un-counseled
priors
were
used
to
make
him
habitual
criminal,
you
cannot
hold
him
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
i
am
sorry.
i
did
not
mean
to
get
undue
attention
mr.
justice
white.
he
is
not,
as
far
as
i
know
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
i
--
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
question
of
the
propriety
of
the
use
in
a
1953
sentencing
hearing
and
sentencing
proceeding
of
records
of
prior
convictions,
in
1938,
1946,
and
possibly
1950,
which
were
obtained
in
the
absence
of
counsel
or
alleged
to
have
been
obtained
in
the
absence
of
counsel.
tucker
was
convicted
in
1953
of
the
robbery
of
the
federally
insured
savings
and
loan
association.
he
was
convicted
in
the
united
state’s
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
california.
now,
the
evidence
in
the
case
which
consisted
of
four
eye
witnesses
and
fingerprint
evidence
and
testimony
is
concededly
overwhelming
and
the
validity
of
his
conviction
and
the
strength
of
the
evidence
against
him
is
not
challenged
in
this
proceeding
or
before
this
court.
tucker
took
the
stand
in
his
own
defense
in
these
proceedings,
in
that
trial
and
he
was
cross
examined
with
respect
to
certain
prior
state
felony
convictions.
he
was
cross
examined
with
respect
to
and
admitted
a
1938
conviction
for
theft
of
an
automobile.
he
was
cross
examined
and
admitted
a
1946
jewelry
store
robbery
in
louisiana.
he
was
cross
examined
with
respect
to
and
admitted
a
conviction
for
armed
robbery
in
1950.
he
was
shortly
thereafter
convicted
of
the
crime
of
robbery
of
a
federally
insured
savings
and
loan
association.
thereafter,
the
judge,
the
trial
court
conducted
a
sentencing
hearing
at
which
it
took
evidence
with
respect
to
the
defendant
tucker.
with
respect
to
these
convictions
which
i
have
mentioned,
certain
further
evidence
was
brought
out.
it
was
brought
out
with
respect
to
the
1938
automobile
theft
conviction
that
he
had
served
seven
of
the
10
years
which
had
been
imposed.
with
respect
to
the
1946
jewelry
store
burglary
that
he
had
served
45
months
out
of
a
four-year
sentence,
and
with
respect
to
the
1950
armed
robbery
conviction,
that
he
had
served
no
time
because
he
escaped
after
a
sentence
of
five
years
was
imposed.
other
information
with
respect
to
the
defendant
was
also
brought
out.
it
was
brought
out
for
instance
that
he
was
under
indictment
in
the
los
angeles
for
another
federal
armed
bank
robbery,
which
was
to
precede
the
trial
immediately
after
the
sentencing.
it
was
brought
out
that
he
was
a
suspect
in
four
other
federal
bank
robberies
and
seven
or
eight
armed
robberies
of
local
savings
and
loan
associations
in
the
san
francisco
area
and
the
evidence
with
respect
tot
those
robberies
was
elicited,
that
is
to
say
that
there
was
evidence,
eye
witness
testimony
and
fingerprint
testimonies
with
respect
to
those
other
charges
and
investigations
against
the
defendant
tucker.
tucker
was
sentenced
to
the
maximum
permissible
term
under
the
statute
providing
for
armed
bank
robbery
of
the
federally
insured
bank,
which
is
25
years.
now,
later
on
in
the
same
year,
the
state
of
california
brought
proceedings
against
tucker
for
armed
robbery
and
he
was
convicted
of
four
arm
robberies
under
california
law.
this
proceeding
occurred
under
the
california
recidivist
statute,
so
that
the
indictment
on
that
case
charged
to
four
arm
robberies
and
in
addition
charged
two
of
the
three
prior
felony
convictions
i
have
mentioned,
the
1938
auto
theft
and
a
1946
jewelry
store
burglary.
following
this
court’s
decision
in
gideon
versus
wainwright,
tucker
successfully
attacked,
first
his
habitual
offender
status
in
california
and
later
on
the
underlying
california
convictions
for
armed
robbery
on
the
ground
that
the
use
of
those
two
priors
had
been
prejudicial
in
as
much
as
he
had
not
had
counsel
in
1938,
and
he
had
not
counsel
in
1946.
now,
following
the
state
court’s
vacation
of
those
two
prior;
1938
and
1946
convictions,
that
is
to
say
its
finding
that
there
had
been
no
counsel,
tucker
brought
a
motion
under
2255,
attacking
the
conviction
which
is
the
subject
of
this
case,
the
bank
robbery
conviction,
alleging
that
the
use
in
cross
examination
of
those
two
priors
which
were
concededly
on
counsel
and
also
alleging
that
the
use
of
the
1950
conviction
which
had
theretofore
not
been
challenged
as
counseled
or
un-counseled,
had
prejudiced
him
when
it
was
used
for
cross
examination
and
impeachment
purposes.
now,
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
both
found
that
the
use
of
un-counseled
priors
was
improper,
but
they
found
that
the
error
was
harmless
because
of
the
overwhelming
evidence
against
the
defendant
in
the
case.
the
court
of
appeals,
however,
found
further
that
those
priors
had
been
used
at
the
sentencing
hearing
and
at
the
sentencing
hearing,
the
judge
might
possibly
have
relied
upon
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
reliance
could
not
be
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
under
chapman
and
remanded
the
case
for
re-sentencing
without
the
use
or
reliance
upon
the
un-counseled
prior
convictions.
therefore,
the
case
is
before
this
court
now,
at
the
request
of
the
united
states
to
determine
whether
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
remanding
that
case
for
re-consideration
of
sentence.
the
question
which
this
court,
this
case
presents
in
this
court
is
whether
a
particular
rule
of
evidence,
specifically
an
exclusionary
rule
of
evidence,
should
be
applied
to
sentencing
proceedings,
so
as
to
deprive
the
sentencing
judge
of
knowledge
or
reliance
upon
prior
convictions
which
were
obtained
without
the
assistance
of
counsel
prior
to
gideon.
now,
it
seems
to
be
common
ground
among
all
the
parties
in
this
case,
that
a
judge
should
have
access
to
and
should
be
entitled
to
rely
upon
all
reliable,
relevant
information
concerning
a
defendant’s
character,
background,
habits
or
dispositions
which
can
be
brought
before
the
sentencing
judge.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
the
1938
auto
theft
conviction
was
a
plea
of
guilty.
in
1946
burglary
store
robbery
was
a
plea
of
guilty.
before
this
morning,
i
have
been
of
the
impression
that
the
1950
sentence
--
the
1950
conviction
had
not
been
challenged.
within
the
hour,
mr.
reppy
showed
me
a
copy
of
the
2255
motion
in
district
court,
which
was
not
made
part
of
the
record
certified
to
this
court
which
indicates
they
also
challenged
the
1950
conviction.
now,
the
19
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
i
believe
it
was,
but
i
simply
do
not
know
because
i
had
thought
that
that
conviction
was
not
being
challenged
before
this
court.
we
are
informed
by
the
clerk
of
the
dade
county
court
because
we
inquired
with
respect
to
this,
that
petitioner
did
have
counsel
during
the
1950
proceeding.
i
should
say
that
the
respondent
tucker
alleges
in
his
brief
that
he
did
not
have
counsel.
that
question
was
never
decided
mr.
justice
white
because
that
1950
conviction
was
not
one
of
the
two
priors
that
was
alleged
in
the
california
recidivist
prosecution,
and
therefore,
not
one
of
the
priors
with
respect
to
what
you
are
hearing
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
the
court
--
the
district
court
simply
held
that
the
use
of
priors,
un-counseled
priors
without
making
specific
findings,
but
acknowledging
the
united
states'
admission
with
respect
to
the
36,
38
and
46
priors
that
they
were
un-counseled,
said
that
the
use
of
un-counseled
priors
in
cross
examination
would
be
bad.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
i
do
not
think
that
that
is
a
dispositive
consideration
mr.
justice
white.
i
know
that
the
two,
38
and
46
were
pleas
of
guilty.
as
i
said,
i
have
believed
until
today
that
the
1950
conviction
what
not
being
challenged
at
all.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
at
the
trial,
and
i
think
this
is
quite
significant,
he
neither
denied
the
convictions
nor
as
i
want
to
say
with
respect
to
the
1938
and
1946
convictions,
he
not
only
did
not
deny
those
convictions,
he
admitted
those
convictions,
but
he
want
further,
he
admitted
the
underlying
conduct.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
he
affirmatively
admitted
the
underlying
conduct
and
i
think
that
insofar
as
there
might
be
a
question
about
the
reliability
of
un-counseled
convictions,
this
cannot
be
considered
in
this
--
in
the
facts
of
this
case.
i
call
the
court’s
attention
to
page
24
of
the
appendix.
with
respect
to
the
1938
automobile
theft,
the
question
about
that
conviction,
answer,
“it
boils
down
to
this.
i
was
17
years
old,
broke
into
a
man’s
garage,
took
his
automobile,
went
joyriding
in
it,
and
received
a
10-year
sentence
for
it.”
so,
he
admits
the
conduct.
he
says
it
was
joyriding,
but
he
admits
he
took
the
car
and
went
from
the
man’s
garage.
with
respect
to
the
1946
jewelry
store
burglary,
again
on
page
24,
“i
broke
into
a
jewelry
store”
and
on
page
24
where
new
orleans,
question;
day
or
night;
answer
“at
night.”
so,
that
with
respect
to
those
two
convictions,
the
question
of
whether
counsel
--
whether
the
absence
of
counsel
makes
the
conviction
unreliable
does
not
appear
before
this
court.
with
respect
to
the
1950
conviction,
the
record
as
at
now
stands
indicates
that
there
has
been
no
determination;
first
of
all,
whether
was
counsel
or
not,
no
judicial
determination.
we
have
made
inquiries
and
we
have
been
told
and
we
recite
in
our
brief
that
the
dade
county
clerk
indicates
to
us
that
counsel
was
supplied.
the
respondent
tucker
in
his
brief
says
that
he
did
not
have
counsel
and
there
has
been
no
determination
of
that
fact,
but
we
submit
that
it
seems
to
us
that
all
of
the
considerations
of
modern
criminology,
calling
for
the
individuation
of
punishment
require
that
a
sentencing
judge
have
all
relevant
information
before
him,
which
will
help
him
in
determining
that
punishment,
and
that
what
include
evidence
of
un-counseled
convictions.
the
application
of
ordinary
rules
of
evidence
or
in
particular
an
exclusionary
rule
of
evidence
to
the
sentencing
proceedings,
would
it
seems
to
us
to
deprive
the
judge
a
valuable
information
concerning
a
defendant’s
background,
a
defendant’s
character
and
dispositions.
now,
in
williams
versus
new
york,
this
court
specifically
refused
to
apply
ordinary
rules
of
evidence,
the
sentencing
proceedings
and
specifically
recognized
that
the
application
of
ordinary
rules
of
evidence
would
frustrate
the
purpose
of
individuation
of
punishment.
you
will
recall
that
in
williams,
the
judge
had
to
report
that
the
defendant
was
involved
in
some
30
other
burglaries,
in
addition
to
the
murder
which
was
the
charge
in
the
indictment.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
just
hearsay
information,
your
honor
and
this
court
and
the
judge
relied
upon
it,
said
he
relied
upon
it,
acknowledged
that
there
had
been
no
convictions
resulting
from
those
report
of
the
other
burglaries
and
as
you
recall
sentenced
william
to
death.
now,
in
this
case
also,
the
sentencing
judge
had
before
him
substantial
information
concerning
this
defendant’s
criminal
activity
which
had
not
resulted
in
a
conviction
un-counseled
or
not
or
an
indictment.
there
was
the
allegation
that
this
defendant
had
been
involved
in
four
federal
bank
robberies,
the
allegation
that
he
had
been
involved
in
7
or
8
armed
robberies
of
savings
and
loan
institutions
and
the
sentencing
judge
was
told
by
the
witness,
he
was
examining
out
for
this
purpose
that
the
evidence
was
substantial,
that
it
was
substantial
and
the
same
as
it
had
been
in
this
trial,
that
is
eye
witness
testimony
and
fingerprint
testimony.
and
the
use
of
that
information,
which
is
allegation
of
criminal
conduct,
falling
short
of
a
conviction
counseled
or
not,
is
not
challenged
in
this
court.
it
seems
to
us
that
it
would
be
ironical,
if
it
were
proper
for
a
court
to
rely
upon
such
hearsay
information
as
mr.
chief
justice
describes
it,
rely
upon
that
information
in
the
assessment
of
sentence
and
yet
would
be
deprived
of
reliance
on
the
same
information
when
it
matured
into
a
conviction,
merely
because
the
conviction
was
un-counseled.
now,
we
know
in
this
case
that
there
is
no
doubt
that
tucker
committed
the
1938
and
the
1946
violations
because
he
admitted
that
he
did,
but
we
submit
that
even
un-counseled
convictions
where
had
been
no
such
admissions
are
no
more
unreliable,
then
much
of
the
evidence
which
is
historically
and
traditionally
been
considered
proper
for
a
sentencing
judge
to
rely
upon.
we
also
would
point
out
to
this
court
that
the
use
of
un-counseled
convictions
in
this
context
has
some
evidence
of
criminality
on
the
part
of
the
defendant,
is
totally
different
from
the
use
of
such
convictions
under
ordinary
recidivist
statutes.
there,
the
prior
convictions
automatically
increase
the
exposure
or
increase
the
mandatory
minimum
and
it
is
the
fact
of
conviction
that
creates
automatically
a
harsher
sentence
and
in
that
case
we
submit,
the
conviction
operates
to
deprive
the
judge
of
discretion
with
a
mandatory
increase
in
sentence.
whereas
the
information
here,
the
un-counseled
conviction
and
the
information
suggests
is
merely
being
used
to
inform
the
discretion
of
the
court
to
give
the
most
intelligent
individual
treatment
to
a
particular
offender.
for
this
reason,
we
think
that
this
court’s
holding
in
burgett
versus
texas
has
no
application
to
the
facts
at
bar.
now,
quite
apart
from
the
question
of
whether
a
sentencing
judge
should
be
permitted
to
rely
upon
un-counseled
convictions,
the
law
seems
clear
that
a
sentencing
judge
can
rely
upon
the
conduct,
which
underly
conviction
and
any
competent
evidence
of
this
criminal
conduct,
any
reports
of
this
conduct
would
be
permissible
information
for
the
judge
to
use,
even
if
he
could
not
rely
upon
the
fact
that
the
conviction
itself.
and
we
submit
that
any
rule
which
would
exclude
the
reliance
upon
such
conduct,
falling
short
of
a
conviction,
would
deprive
the
judge
of
much
valuable
information
which
courts
have
traditionally,
historically
and
properly
relied
upon.
a
charge
might
be
dropped
because
the
prosecuting
witness
did
not
appear,
or
it
might
be
dropped
as
an
exercise
of
prosecutorial
discretion
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
that
it
--
i
think
that
is
an
important
distinction,
your
honor.
there
are
cases,
even
sentencing
cases
where
suppressed
evidence
has
not
been
used
or
permitted
to
be
used
as
information
before
the
sentencing
judge
and
the
rationale
of
those
cases
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
whole
deterrent
rationale
of
the
perspective
application
of
math.
the
theory
of
the
courts
that
forbid
the
use
of
illegally
seized
evidence
in
a
sentencing
hearing
suggests
that
if
it
were
permitted,
a
prosecutor
or
the
police
could
deprive
an
individual,
would
be
encouraged,
if
they
have
enough
evidence
to
seize
a
person
for
a
narrowed
crime,
would
be
encouraged
to
engage
in
rampant
searches
thereafter,
figuring
that
once
they
could
convict
him
of
the
narrow
crime,
they
could
put
in
everything
else
on
the
sentencing
hearing
and
obtain
a
maximum
sentence.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
i
am
sorry?
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
that
is
--
there
is
a
circuit
course
--
circuit
court
case.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
your
honor,
if
the
case
is
a
(voice
overlap)
vertigo.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
and,
i
--
i
cannot
tell
you
that
the
circuit,
but
it
is
cited
in
the
respondent’s
brief,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
rationale,
the
deterrent
rationale
which
would
prohibit
the
use
of
that
evidence
all
be
in
significant
evidence
is
distinguishable
from
this
case
where
we
are
only
concerned
about
the
issue
of
reliability.
it
is
common
place
in
pre-sentence
reports,
for
instance,
for
a
probation
officer
or
the
prosecutor
in
talking
to
probation
officer,
to
try
and
put
the
defendant
in
a
context
of
criminality
which
may
not
be
revealed
by
the
indictment
of
the
trial
itself
to
give
the
sentencing
judge
some
idea
of
this
person’s
place
in
an
entire
criminal
scheme.
that
kind
of
information
has
always
been
included
in
pre-sentence
reports,
but
it
is
information
that
may
enhance
punishment
and
it
is
not
sworn,
and
it
is
not
usually
subject
to
cross
examination,
and
yet
it
is
information
which
we
feel
ought
properly
to
be
before
the
sentencing
court.
further,
even
regardless
of
the
reliability
of
the
conviction,
it
seems
to
us
that
incarcerations
that
result
as
a
basis
of
--
as
a
result
of
un-counseled
convictions
are
information
which
a
sentencing
judge
should
have
before
him.
the
court
will
notice
in
this
case,
at
the
age
of
17,
tucker
is
convicted
of
auto
theft.
he
is
sentenced
to
10
years
in
jail.
he
stays
in
jail
till
mid
1945.
released
in
mid
1945,
he
is
probably
convicted
again
in
1946,
stays
in
jail
for
mid
19
--
from
1946
until
mid
1949.
released
in
the
middle
of
1949,
he
probably
commits
an
armed
robbery
in
1950.
he
is
sentenced
on
that
and
he
escapes,
but
less
than
a
year
later
in
1951,
he
commits
the
crime
which
is
subject
of
this
case.
thus
from
the
age
of
17
and
from
1938
to
1951,
tucker
spent
the
entire
intervening
period
with
months
exceptions
in
jail.
now,
it
seems
to
us
the
sentencing
judge
could
not
rationally
individuate
the
punishment,
or
the
treatment
of
tucker,
in
ignorance
of
those
facts.
and,
i
think
that
respondent
tucker
really
admits
that
when
he
suggests
that
perhaps
that
information
should
be
before
the
sentencing
judge.
now,
i
think
finally,
your
honor,
there
is
a
--
there
is
no
real
evidence
in
this
case
that
the
sentencing
judge
relied
upon
these
prior
convictions
in
imposing
the
sentence
which
he
did
impose.
the
judge
was
specifically
told
in
this
case
that
tucker
was
a
suspect
in
four
other
robberies,
federal
robberies,
seven
or
eight
other
savings
and
loan
robberies,
and
he
was
told
on
the
strength
of
the
evidence
with
respect
to
those.
he
was
told
about
a
pending
indictment
in
los
angeles.
now,
the
judge
specifically
said
he
would
not
consider
the
pending
indictment
in
los
angeles
because
in
essence,
that
case
would
take
care
of
itself.
it
would
be
a
sentence
appropriate
to
that
offense,
but
his
statements
and
these
occur
at
the
end
of
the
sentencing
hearing,
indicate
the
matters
which
he
truly
relied
upon
and
those
are
these
pending
investigations.
this
occurs
on
page
37
of
the
appendix.
with
the
court’s
permission,
i
will
read
a
few
lines.
“i
take
it,”
this
is
the
court
asking
the
question,
“you
did
not
present
these
cases
until
you
determined
the
fate
of
this
particular
case.
is
that
the
problem
involved?
”the
witness,
who
is
an
fbi
agent,
“well,
these
particular
cases
i
am
talking
about
are
local.
they
are
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
local
police.
there
is
no
federal
jurisdiction.
now,
i
understand
the
district
attorney’s
office
in
alameda
county
is
waiting.
what
action
they
are
going
to
take,
i
do
not
know.”
and
then
the
court,
“i
assume
that
whatever
sentence
is
meted
out
to
the
defendant
in
this
case
at
bar
will
be
considered
in
connection
with
the
prosecution
or
absence
of
prosecution
in
those
cases.”
the
witness,
“i
believe
so.”
the
court,
“alright,
and
then
do
you
have
further
and
promptly
imposes
the
25-year
maximum
sentence”
and
we
submit
that
those
were
the
considerations
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
that
is
an
fbi
agent,
the
man
who
arrested
the
defendant
in
the
first
instance.
i
think
there
is
a
further
indication
of
the
fact
that
these
particular
priors
were
not
relied
upon
by
sentencing
judge
and
that
also
was
only
called
to
my
attention
within
the
last
hour
by
mr.
reppy,
another
document
which
was
not
included
in
the
record
on
appeal,
but
it
is
part
of
the
record
below.
it
appears
that
in
the
2255
motion
originally
made
before
the
district
judge
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
in
this
case,
tucker
challenged
the
convictions
because
of
the
use
of
these
priors
on
cross.
the
judge
said
harmless
error.
tucker
then
moved
and
this
does
not
appear
in
the
appendix
because
it
was
not
certified
to
this
court,
tucker
then
moved
for
a
reconsideration
of
sentence
on
the
ground
of
the
sentencing
judge,
who
incidentally
was
the
same
judge
who
in
1953
had
heard
the
case,
move
for
reconsideration
of
sentence
on
the
grounds
with
the
use
of
priors
at
sentence.
and,
the
judge’s
disposition
of
that
was
preemptory.
he
simply
said
this
raises
no
new
issues
which
would
require
consideration.
therefore,
i
think
that
it
is
clear
that
the
sentencing
judge
in
this
case
did
not
feel
that
those
priors
had
influenced
his
sentencing.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
i
believe
that
it
had
been.
these
are
documents
which
mr.
reppy
obtained,
they
are
copies
of
tucker’s
own
records
and
i
had
not
known
them
to
be
part
of
the
record.
i
am
at
the
moment
relying
upon
the
representation
of
mr.
reppy
that
these
are
official
records
in
the
case
and
they
are
not
part
of
the
record
before
that
was
lodged
in
this
court
because
until
this
moment,
i
did
not
know
they
existed.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
they
are
part
of
the
record
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
in
this
case.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
in
this
case.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
in
this
case,
they
are
simply
not
lodged
in
the
court
because
we
did
know
of
their
existence
until
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
that
appears
to
be
what
happened,
but
i
do
think
that
this
particular
order
is
significant
because
it
shows
that
the
very
sentencing
judge
in
this
case,
who
had
sentenced
this
man
in
1953,
when
he
admits
on
the
subsequent
question
that
the
use
of
the
priors
in
cross
examination
is
bad
and
then
he
says
--
then
the
respondent
says
well,
what
about
the
use
of
them
in
sentencing
and
the
sentencing
judge
says
“that
does
not
call
for
any
further
consideration.”
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
it
appears
in
the
form
of
an
order
denying
a
motion
for
rehearing.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
i
assume
there
would
be
docket
entry
mr.
justice
white.
i
have
been
looking
at
the
record,
if
it
was
docketed
here,
i
did
not
find
that
that
item,
and
i
have
only
learned
of
it
within
the
last
hour,
but
i
do
submit
it
is
of
perhaps
controlling
significance
in
this
case
because
the
question
might
be
as
to
why
not
let
the
judge
take
another
crack
at
it.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
perhaps
i
should
say
mr.
justice
white
(voice
overlap)
it
is
sufficient,
but
not
necessary
for
the
government’s
position.
thank
you.
if
i
have
any
further
time,
i
would
like
to
reserve
it
for
rebuttal.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
first
mr.
chief
justice,
you
asked
the
citation
of
the
vertigo
case
which
related
to
the
use
of
a
evidence
which
had
been
seized
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
that
is
a
ninth
circuit
case,
your
honor,
it
is
402
f.
2d
599.
with
respect
to
petitioner's
contention
that
at
the
sentencing
hearing,
he
protested
innocence
and
he
meant
to
say
“both,”
that
is
to
say
both
the
1938
florida
conviction
for
auto
theft,
and
the
1950
florida
conviction
for
armed
robbery,
as
i
read
the
record
and
i
have
nothing
outside
the
record
to
rely
upon,
it
seems
to
me,
your
honors,
that
what
he
is
saying
with
the
respect
the
auto
theft
is
that
was
a
joyride.
that
was
not
grand
larceny
auto.
i
mean,
i
did
it,
but
it
was
not
a
crime
of
that
magnitude
and
that
is
a
sense
of
innocence
which
he
is
asserting.
now,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
very
briefly
to
this
notion
of
conclusiveness
which
mr.
reppy
has
raised.
there
is
an
extensive
portion
of
the
respondent’s
brief
addressed
to
the
notion
and
to
the
rule
of
law
that
for
certain
purposes
convictions
are
conclusive
evidence
of
guilt
and
that
arises
principally
in
impeachment
proceedings
where
a
person
is
often
not
allowed
to
explain
that
although
i
was
convicted
i
felt
in
fact
guilty.
that
only
arises
in
context
where
rules
of
evidence
supply
and
i
submit
that
importing
conclusiveness
into
sentencing,
a
respondent
commits
the
same
error
that
he
is
attempting
to
do
when
he
wants
to
import
the
rules
of
evidence
into
sentencing
generally.
whereas
we
would
claim
that
the
rules
of
evidence
do
not
apply
and
any
reliable
information
can
be
used,
we
would
maintain
the
same
with
respect
to
any
doctrine
of
conclusiveness.
i
cannot
conceive
of
a
probation
officer,
if
a
defendant
being
examined
by
him
for
the
purpose
of
preparation
of
a
pre-sentence
report
says
“yes,
i
have
the
x
conviction,
the
y
conviction,
but
i
did
not
do
it.
i
did
not
have
an
attorney
or
i
did
not
do
it
or
i
was
under
duress.”
i
think
that
all
of
the
books
which
have
been
collected
in
respondent’s
brief
and
all
of
the
learning
that
the
court
may
find
on
the
subject
of
sentencing
in
preparation
of
pre-sentence
reports
indicates
that
these
gentleman,
the
probation
officers
are
trained
to
be
open
minded
and
train
to
include
everything.
and
i
do
not
think
that
doctrine
of
conclusiveness
would
ever
precluded
a
defendant
in
a
pre-sentence
report
from
alleging
his
innocence
or
circumstances
of
mitigation
and
i
simply
feel
that
conclusiveness
has
not
relevance
in
this
case.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
that
is
correct.
the
--
in
this
case,
it
appears
that
the
judge
required
his
information
orally.
i
was
addressing
myself
to
more
general
problem
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
--
of
whether
conclusiveness
would
create
any
bar.
with
respect
to
matters
that
judge
harris
considered,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
that
very
briefly
because
mr.
justice
white
you
raised
a
question
about
that.
i
think
that
if
you
read
the
record,
it
is
clear
that
he
did
not
rely
upon
the
pending
federal
los
angeles
indictment,
but
that
he
did
rely
upon
the
seven
or
eight
pending
state
investigations,
four
of
which
did
later
in
fact
resulted
in
convictions
and
which
were
later
collaterally
attacked.
so,
i
think
that
his
--
the
things
that
he
did
not
rely
upon
was
the
situation,
where
there
was
indictment
and
in
the
judge's
eyes
the
indictment
was
going
to
take
care
of
itself.
that
there
would
be
a
prosecution
in
appropriate
sentence,
but
as
to
those
pending
state
proceedings,
he
felt
that
the
state
might
prosecute
or
not
prosecute
or
prosecute
some
and
not
others
depending
on
what
happened
at
his
sentencing.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
no,
because
he
was
successful
in
first
attacking
his
habitual
criminal
finding.
that
went
up
to
the
california
supreme
court
and
they
said
if
un-counseled
priors
were
used
to
make
him
habitual
criminal,
you
cannot
hold
him
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
i
am
sorry.
i
did
not
mean
to
get
undue
attention
mr.
justice
white.
he
is
not,
as
far
as
i
know
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
i
--
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that.
