justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
could
not
judge
that
i
was
guilty
then
i
have
to
go
into
such
detail
as
to
say
it
was
in
1936
ford?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
reppy,
you
really
want
us
to
hold
responsibility
of
state
judges
to
make
findings
before
they
sentence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
thought
that
is
what
you
said?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
i
do
not
understand
how
we
can
require
this
binding
every
time
a
judge
sentences
somebody?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
did
not
say
that
but
how
can
we
compel
it,
just
because
it
is
useful?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
do
not
think
we
should
compel
it
in
the
federal
court
before
we
go
into
state
courts
compelling
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
right!
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
realize
that
i
would
assume
that
every
federal
district
has
federal
procedure
as
to
handle
pre-sentence
reports?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
realize
that
in
most
districts
today
the
prosecution
does
not
have
anything
to
do
with
it?
