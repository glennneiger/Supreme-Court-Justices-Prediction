left.
we
will
give

a
measure
on

mr.
reppy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
these
three
prior
convictions,
the
ones
that
appear
on
24
and
25
that
is
in
1938
breaking
in
and
stealing
a
car,
1946,
a
jewelry
store
and
19
--
later
period,
not
identified,
breaking
in
to
another
store
in
new
orleans?
now,
you
are
talking
about
those
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
difference
does
it
make,
will
you
tell
me
what
difference
that
makes,
what
the
circumstances
the
conviction
were
when
at
the
time
of
this
hearing
he
affirmatively
described
his
conduct
to
the
judge?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
now,
is
this
incorrect?
the
appendix
at
page
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
his
language
really
is
ambiguous?
his
answer
is,
it
all
boils
down
to
this,
when
i
was
17,
broke
into
a
man’s
garage,
took
his
automobile
and
went
joyriding,
and
got
a
10-year
sentence,
received
the
10-year
sentence”
and
then
he
repeats,
“you
broke
into
the
place
and
stole
the
car?”
“yes.”
“what
kind
of
a
car
did
you
steal?”
“a
36
ford.”
“tell
us
about
your
other
convictions?’
“in
1946,
i
broke
into
a
jewelry
store.”
“where”
and
so
forth,
he
goes
on
and
describes
the
cities
and
then
still
at
the
fourth
one,
apparently
not
relied
upon
was
his
submission
that
was
he
a
fugitive
from
the
state
of
florida
because
he
fled
his
5
year
of
sentence
when
he
was
in
the
hospital
for
some
medical
treatment
away
from
the
prison.
now,
do
you
suggest
that
the
court,
the
sentencing
court
cannot
take
into
account
his
conduct
in
sentencing
as
distinguished
from
the
receipt
of
the
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
the
invalid
conviction
is
supported
now
by
what
amounts
now
to
a
judicial
confession
in
an
open
court
at
the
time
he
is
represented
by
counsel,
would
you
still
maintain
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(voice

i
have
the
appendix
in
my
hand
and
i
am
looking
at
pages
24
and
25.
what
judge
was
presiding
over
the
hearing
in
this
examination
at
pages
24,
25,
and
26
took
place?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
way
i
understand
your
argument
to
be,
that
he
could
not
take
into
account
the
cumulative
admissions
and
statements
made
as
reflected
in
those
three
pages?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
do
not
read
this.
this
is
very
concocted
inquiry.
i
thought
his
explanations
of
his
criminal
conduct
were
very
expansive.
he
could
hardly
have
described
more
unless
he
gave
an
inventory
of
what
he
had
stolen
from
the
jewelry
shop?
chief
justice
warren
e.

two,

jewelry

robberies?
