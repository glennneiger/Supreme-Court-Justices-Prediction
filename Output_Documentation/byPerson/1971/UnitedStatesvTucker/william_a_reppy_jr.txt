mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
counsel
for
the
united
states
has
characterized
this
case
as
an
exclusionary
rule
of
case.
mr.
tucker
characterizes
the
case,
and
i
think
the
ninth
circuit,
majority
and
dissent
did
also
as
a
prejudicial
error
case
and
that
your
honors,
it
is,
so
long
as
gideon
versus
wainwright
is
retroactive.
the
reason
that
we
are
referring
both
counsels,
in
our
argument
so
often
to
the
record
and
reading
portions
of
the
record
to
the
court
is
that
whether
the
ninth
circuit
correctly
decided
this
case
turns
on
whether
this
record
offers
some
hint
that
an
injustice
occurred,
that
perhaps
the
sentence
would
have
been
lower
if
judge
harris,
in
1953,
had
realized
that
there
had
been
no
reliable
adjudication
of
guilt
of
the
three
prior
convictions,
1938,
1946
and
19
--
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
those
are
not
the
same
three
mr.
chief
justice.
they
were
used
both
--
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
well,
let
me
say
--
state
it
at
the
outset
that
mr.
tucker
as
you
will
note
in
his
in
propria
persona
written
opposition
to
writ
of
certiorari,
admits
guilt
of
one
of
those
three
priors.(voice
overlap)
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
no
sir,
it
is
not.
now,
you
notice
mr.
chief
justice
that
he
does
not
make
an
admission
as
to
the
1950
prior.
our
focus
here
is
on
his
statement,
“i
broke
in
and
stole
a
car.”
undoubtedly,
it
can
be
read
as
an
admission.
i
think
also
in
view
of
what
happened
and
how
this
came
up,
we
can
construe
this
portion
of
the
record
as
mr.
tucker
describing
himself
as
the
defendant,
describing
what
he
was
charged
with.
here
was
the
quandary
he
was
in.(voice
overlap)
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
not
at
all.
no
way.
we
do
not
view
the
ninth
circuit
ruling
in
anyway
as
precluding
the
court
upon
remand
from
considering
the
conduct.
in
fact,
the
ninth
circuit
majority's
concluding
paragraph
specifically
states
that
the
re-sentencing
is
to
occur
without
any
consideration
of
invalid
convictions
and
unquestionably,
if
this
re-sentencing
hearing
is
held,
the
conduct
involved
would
be
gone
into.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
yes,
but
for
two
reasons.
some
judges
in
the
exercise
of
their
discretion
at
sentencing,
simply
do
not
consider
charges
in
proof
of
guilt
other
than
a
conviction.
the
authorities
which
are
recited
in
respondent’s
brief
make
that
clear.
the
particular
reason
is
not
given.
it
seems
to
be
a
compartmentalization
by
the
judge,
a
rule
of
thumb.
i
consider
convictions.
i
do
not
consider
charges
which
have
not
resulted
in
a
conviction.
in
connecticut,
for
example,
the
judges
do
not
consider
charges
that
have
not
resulted
in
a
conviction.
now,
how
judge
harris
approach
this?
we
can
only
speculate
as.
we
know
that
he
would
not
consider
the
los
angeles
charge
because
that
was
coming
up
to
trial,
and
what
he
is
stated
and
what
mr.
tuttle
read
on
page
37
as
to
the
northern
california
charges
in
state
court,
i
would
submit
it
is
simply
ambiguous.
it
maybe
saying,
“i
know,
i
am
giving
a
heavy
sentence
on
the
basis
of
what
occurred
and
i
do
realize
that
it
maybe
increased,
but
i
hope
it
would
not
be.
i
think
that
the
remand
procedure
would
bring
the
clarification
that
we
want”
and
finally
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
mister
--
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
i
do
believe
you
do,
mr.
justice.
he
would
going
to
say
the
word
“both”
after
the
word
“of.”
if
you
notice
the
context
there,
he
describes
the
prior
convictions.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
“and
the
five
year
sentence
that
was
given
me,”
that
is
1950,
“i
was
convicted
by
a
judge,
the
same
judge
that
gave
me
the
five,
gave
me
the
10
to
start
with,”
that
is
1938
in
florida
“and
i
was
innocent
of”
and
he
stops.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
that
is
neither
here
and
there,
and
--
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
i
think
it
susceptible
of
the
interpretation
consistent
with
his
in
propria
persona
opposition
to
the
writ,
that
he
considers
both
of
his
florida
convictions
improper
in
that,
i
was
innocent
both
was
what
he
is
going
to
say.
but
now
that
we
have
read
this
passage
which
i
plan
to
read
later
to
the
court,
i
would
like
to
consider
why
mr.
tucker
stopped
his
explanation
on
elocution.
he
was
beginning
to
give
evidence
in
mitigation
to
explain
and
he
stops
suddenly
and
he
says
“that
is
neither
here
or
there”
and
there
are
things
to
be
only
two
possible
reasons
that
he
stopped.
what
the
first
one
is
that
he
realized
or
believed
that
the
convictions
then
subject
to
collateral
attack
because
gideon
had
not
been
decided,
were
conclusive
and
as
noted
in
respondent’s
brief,
there
was
considerable
authority
at
that
time
that
was
so.
whether
that
be
authority
that
commends
itself
to
out
logic,
it
seems
to
be
irrelevant
because
defense
counsel
who
was
there
at
sentencing
had
told
mr.
tucker
not
to
get
into
that.
the
other
possibility
is
that
mr.
tucker
felt
he
would
simply
irk
judge
harris
by
protesting
innocence
of
matters
by
which
he
stood
as
the
law
then
read
validly
convicted
and
judge
leventhal
of
the
dc
circuit
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
the
scott
case
which
is
cited
in
respondent’s
briefs,
states
that
the
overwhelming
majority
of
sentencing
judges
in
his
view
do
not
like
see
a
defendant
before
him
protesting
innocence
after
a
lawful
conviction.
so,
it
is
quite
possible
that
had
mr.
tucker
had
the
benefit
of
gideon
mr.
tucker
and
his
counsel
at
that
point,
he
would
not
have
stopped,
and
we
would
have
had
some
explanation
here
of
these
incidents,
the
1938
incident
when
he
was
17
and
the
1950
incident
in
florida,
and
it
is
reasonably
possible
that
he
might
have
been
convinced
judge
harris.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
have
corresponded
extensively
with
mr.
tucker
and
this
material
is
off
the
record,
i
wish
i
could
refer
to
it
before
you
now.
i
will
just
simply
say
this.
there
is
one
other
point
about
what
is
there
on
page
24.
this
statement
was
the
direct
result
of
a
burgett
versus
texas
error
that
mr.
tuttle
for
the
government
has
conceded.
it
was
found
by
the
district
court
to
be
a
burgett
versus
texas
error
to
receive
these
three
priors
at
the
guilt
determination.
it
was
found
by
the
northern
--
ninth
circuit
to
be
error.
burgett
has
been
retroactively
applied.
it
is
not
a
matter
we
have
briefed
here,
but
this
issue
is
before
the
court.
it
looks
at
page
24
of
the
transcript
here
and
to
determine
what
happened
because
that
is
a
poisonous
fruit
of
that
error.
in
it
came
the
three
priors
which
were
unreliable
and
un-counseled
and
the
poor
man
trying
to
rehabilitate
himself
in
the
eyes
of
the
jury
in
effect
confesses.
he
might
have
been
lying.
it
is
not
likely,
but
he
might
have
been.
maybe
he
might
have
decided
the
best
thing
to
do
was
take
advantage
of
his
age
which
was
17
and
to
try
to
get
some
sympathy
from
the
jury
by
in
effect
confessing
and
(voice
overlap).
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
yes,
and
before
the
jury.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
yes!
what
i
say
is
that
the
agent
is
present
in
court.
this
agent
in
effect
delivered
a
verbal
sentence
report.
so,
as
soon
as
when
that
began
the
sentencing
proceeding
has
begun.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
i
do
not
--mr.
tucker
would
be
out
of
prison,
sir,
to
begin
with,
but
assuming
that
the
time
difference
--
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
i
would
be
here.
if
he
was
willing
to
take
the
risk
of
north
carolina
versus
pearce
of
a
higher
sentence
and
go
back
in
there
and
ask
for
reconsideration,
i
would
be
here
because
i
think
that
the
remedy
that
commends
itself
to
the
court
and
a
remedy
which
is
followed
apparently
in
the
fifth
circuit
is
that
finding
should
be
made
by
the
sentencing
judge
as
to
how
he
was
affected
by
the
improper
material
before
him.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
well,
it
is
certainly
not
necessary
to
decided,
but
i
would
assume
so
that
what
the
court
wrote
there
permits
a
very
limited
consideration
of
prison
incident
so
long
is
there
actual
proof
of
them
and
they
are
not
hearsay.
on
the
procedural
matters
of
--
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
the
findings
i
feel
should
be
made
upon
a
section
2255
motion
if
it
is
a
federal
prisoner
or
upon
the
state
court
habeas
motion
when
a
state
prisoner
goes
before
the
judge
and
answers,
your
honor,
you
considered
information
that
was
wrong.
since
this
court
decided
townsend
versus
burke
in
1948,
there
have
been
perhaps
two
dozen
reported
cases
like
this
implying
the
townsend
versus
burke
principle
that
due
process
is
denied,
where
there
is
substantially
unreliable
information
before
the
judge
and
the
uniform
procedure
seems
to
be,
your
honor,
to
send
the
petition
back
to
the
sentencing
judge
if
he
is
available
and
get
some
findings
from
him,
if
he
can
reconstruct
it,
as
to
how
he
was
effected
and
i
would
assume,
if
he
cannot
reconstruct
it,
he
should
make
findings
as
to
his
normal
practice
in
dealing
with
prior
conviction
and
arrests.
because
as
noted,
particularly
in
the
annotation
in
alr
that
i
have
cited,
where
the
annotation
went
quite
--
have
picked
up
sentencing
decisions
from
all
parts
of
the
country,
the
majority
approach
seems
to
be
to
simply
disregard
un-adjudicated
charges.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
it
would
be
useful
if
he
made
it
then,
but
it
is
not
necessary.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
i
would
not
compel
it
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
well,
it
is
not
necessary
that
this
federal
case
here
be
extended
to
the
states
because
this
is
a
federal
conviction
and
it
is
arises
under
2255
which
allows
for
a
non
constitutional
collateral
attack
on
the
sentence.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
and
if
your
feeling
is
that
you
wish
to
limit
this
principle
to
the
federal
judicial
system,
i
think
it
is
quite
proper
to
do
so
and
if
there
is
precedent
would
be
(inaudible)
case
in
the
court
of
appeals
which
i
have
cited
cited
in
respondent’s
brief.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
i
am
certainly
sure
that
is
so,
but
i
am
not
certain
--
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
well,
i
was
not
aware
of
that,
but
i
think
that
the
--
regardless
of
what
procedure
was
originally
used
at
sentencing,
the
procedure
mentioned
in
the
fifth
circuit
decision
of
pat
versus
united
states
in
1966
is
the
desirable
procedure
to
handle
a
collateral
attack.
now,
in
the
pat
case
there
was
a
federal
prisoner,
a
direct
prisoner
is
sentenced
in
a
federal
prison
and
he
submitted
a
2255
motion
in
which
he
alleged
that
the
sentencing
judge
had
before
him
on
the
pre-sentence
report
an
entry
that
this
man
had
been
convicted
of
burglary
and
an
entry
that
this
man
had
raped
someone,
a
girl
and
the
judge
took
this,
and
i
believe,
although
it
is
not
clear,
without
holding
an
evidentiary
hearing
or
without
appointing
counsel,
he
obtained
the
record
of
the
sentencing
and
he
made
extensive
findings
as
to
what
he
would
have
done
or
how
he
would
reacted,
had
the
entries
been
false
and
had
he
no
match,
and
his
conclusion
was
that
there
was
so
much
other
criminal
activity
on
the
record
that
he
would
have
given
the
same
sentence
in
any
event
because
the
additional
burglary
and
the
additional
rape
did
not
make
that
much
difference.
now,
that
maybe
true
in
our
case.
there
was
a
lot
of
criminal
activity,
but
i
do
not
see
any
reason
why
it
is
too
much
to
ask
of
judge
harris,
who
was
still
sitting,
to
make
these
types
of
findings.
i
feel
that
he
ought
to
have
done
so
when
the
motion
originally
came
up
to
him.
as
mr.
tuttle
has
indicated,
mr.
tucker
the
prisoner,
and
respondent
here
in
propria
persona
filed
a
petition
under
burgett
versus
texas
attacking
the
conviction
itself,
on
the
basis
of
what
we
have
read
at
page
24
and
what
preceded
it
when
the
priors
were
introduced
to
impeach
him.
he
did
not
in
his
original
moving
papers
mentioned
the
sentence.
the
government
did
not
in
its
reply
papers
mentioned
the
sentence.
the
judge
then
wrote
the
opinion
which
is
in
the
appendix
which
does
not
mention
sentencing
at
all.
the
opinion
relies
heavily
on
the
record
to
indicate
that
as
far
as
impeachment
went,
there
was
harmless
error
because
the
man
was
thoroughly,
mr.
tucker
was
thoroughly,
discredited
on
rebuttal
evidence
and
this
is
true
and
then,
after
this
opinion
came
down
from
judge
harris,
mr.
tucker
filed
what
he
labeled
a
petition
for
rehearing
which
goes
on
for
several
pages
laying
out
what
happened
at
sentencing
and
requesting
sentencing.
and
mr.
tuttle
has
accurately
described
judge
harris’
response
to
that,
a
truce
order
saying
rehearing
denied,
the
petition
raises
no
new
issue
that
warrants
reconsideration.
and
it
was
a
new
issue
if
the
court
please,
because
instead
of
weighing
the
priors
as
impeaching
devices
against
the
testimony
of
guilt
and
the
discrediting
testimony,
the
judge
should
have
then
weighed
the
priors
as
evidence
of
guilt
against
the
other
evidence
of
guilt
that
was
done
in
the
pat
case
to
see
if
it
would
have
made
any
difference.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
i
would
suggest
that
if
that
judge
were
available
perhaps
in
retirement.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
if
he
is
deceased,
the
--
a
sentencing
judge
or
district
court
judge
hearing
a
2255
motion
can
only
put
himself
in
the
position
of
a
sentencing
judge
and
said
would
not
have
affected
me
and
i
do
believe
mister
--
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
if
the
opinion
is
why
should
not
this
court?
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
that
would
be
proper
and
it
would
seem
that
he
is
at
the
sentencing
court,
he
can
do
the
re-sentencing
himself.
on
the
other
hand,
he
could
simply
reach
the
same
result
if
the
re-sentencing
was
not
to
decrease
the
term.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
he
would
put
on
a
new
role
by
what
i
understand.
i
am
not
certain
how
it
is
done,
but
i
would
not
think
that
the
sentencing
judge
was
gone
and
we
were
in
the
particular
district
and
division
where
he
was
sentenced.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
counsel
would
--
at
sentencing
counsel
would
be
available.
the
pat
case
lends
itself
to
the
point
that
no
evidentiary
hearing
need
be
required
in
cases
where
the
sentencing
judge
can
state
with
the
assurance
that
he
was
not
affected,
the
procedure
in
the
pat
case
of
the
fifth
circuit
and
perhaps
this
problem
never
would
arisen
if
judge
harris
had
only
instead
of
denying
that
re-hearing
petition
made
some
findings.
they
could
have
been
so
conclusive
on
the
point
that
mr.
tucker
would
not
have
no
basis
for
appeal.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
he
could
have
misunderstood
what
mr.
tucker
was
seeking.
i
would
--
the
papers
are
rather
clearer
it
would
seem
but
the
statement
there
is
no
new
issue
is
wrong
and
suggest
perhaps
a
misunderstanding.
now,
on
the
--
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
petition
for
re-hearing.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
if
he
had
read
it
--
if
he
had
read
it
casually.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
in
all
candor
though
mr.
justice
brennan,
it
is
a
well
written
petition
for
rehearing
and
judge
harris
should
not
have
mistaken
it
for
it
was.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
i
think
that
has
procedural
error
in
that
we
simply
do
not
have
a
record
or
appeal
and
it
is
simply
a
matter
of
the
desirable
procedure
to
cut
down
on
the
appeals
that
go
on
in
the
22
--
collateral
attack
proceedings.
it
is
best
for
this
court
and
as
the
ninth
circuit
seems
to
indicate
it
once
for
to
require
the
sentencing
judge
to
take
whatever
time
it
takes,
20
minutes
--
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
that
maybe
so,
when
it
simply
says
denied,
but
here
we
have
raises
no
new
issue
and
yet
on
the
face
of
it
there
is
the
potential
for
prejudice.
it
is
possible
that
judge
harris
believed
that
mr.
tucker
was
guilty
of
these
three
prior
convictions
and
as
the
two
of
them
if
he
had
not
felt
that
it
was
neither
here
nor
there,
if
he
had
known
of
his
right
to
collateral
attack,
he
might
have
convinced
the
judge
and
received
a
lesser
sentence.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
he
is
still
there.
we
object.[laughter]
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
yes
it
was,
the
maximum.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
he
remains
in
the
federal
prison
in
washington
and
although,
he
states
that
he
is
entitled
to
release
in
1972,
mr.
tuttle
advices
that
he
has
to
check
with
the
bureau
of
prisons
and
that
the
mandatory
release
date
appears
to
be
1973.
so,
there
is
some
uncertainty
about
that.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
no,
he
has
not,
your
honor
as
i
understand
it.
i
have
been
receiving
mail
from
him
--
from
steilacoom
in
washington,
d.c.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
judge
harris
is
the
only
district
judge
involved
in
this
case
at
all
proceedings,
the
trial,
the
sentencing,
the
2255,
it
is
the
same
judge
throughout.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
not
at
all,
your
honor.
it
had
there
--
the
two
points
i
am
making
are,
that
he
should
have
taken
into
account
under
the
proper
context.
if
it
was
--
if
he
knew
that
this
man
was
speaking
about
these
convictions
under
the
belief
that
he
was
conclusively
presumed
guilty,
he
might
have
discounted
it
because
the
fact
the
man
believes
he
is
conclusively
presumed
guilty
rather
limits
his
explanation
as
he
cut
himself
off
by
saying
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
when
he
started
to
go
into
an
explanation.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
a
man
does
not
contest
his
guilt
of
the
jewelry
store
robbery.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
the
1946
jewelry
store
robbery;
he
does
and
he
never
did
admit
at
any
point
in
the
proceedings
guilt
of
the
1950
florida
conviction
and
as
mr.
tuttle
has
noted,
judge
harris
has
never
rule
on
its
validity,
although,
the
validity
of
question
was
before
judge
harris
and
for
that
reason.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
no.
he
is
not.
he
is
on
parole
on
--
if
he
violates
his
parole,
he
is.
he
is
on
parole
on
a
conviction
one
set
of
robberies.
as
to
the
other
set
of
robberies,
the
appendix
to
respondent's
brief
indicates
that
the
charges
where
dismissed
and
they
cannot
be
brought
again
because
to
my
believe,
because
of
the
statute
of
limitations
in
california.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
i
am
not
certain
--
i
do
not
think
the
record
indicates
which
bank
robbery
occurred
at
what
point
in
time.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
one
of
the
most
federal,
excuse
me?
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
yes,
--
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
it
is
extremely
ambiguous
mr.
justice
white,
what
judge
harris
said
he
would
not
consider.
it
is
very
clear
that
he
was
not
going
to
consider
the
los
angeles
charges.
now,
what
--
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
yes,
he
was.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
i
am
not
certain
whether
he
was
serving,
whether
was
moved
down
to
a
california
prison
to
serve
the
two
federal
and
state
sentences
consecutively.
i
do
know
that
the
one’s
that
he
is
not
on
the
parole
out
on
which
he
is
not
on
parole
are
those
which
are
discussed
in
the
appendix
to
the
brief.
i
would
like
a
little
briefly
in
argument
to
the
point
made
in
part
3
of
respondent's
brief
and
that
is
that
judge
harris
in
1953
when
he
was
sentencing
petitioner
had
no
way
to
know
that
petitioner
had
previously
spent
eleven-and-half-years
in
prison
wrongfully
because
of
unreliable
convictions,
convictions
which
were
made
without
counsel.
perhaps
the
judge
would
have
want
to
have
shown
some
leniency.
now,
we
have
the
statement
at
the
bottom
of
page
35
of
the
appendix,
“there
is
no
room
for
the
court
to
entertain
elements
of
great
sympathy”
because
mr.
tucker
was
using
a
gun,
even
though
he
did
not
point
it
to
anyone,
but
there
was
some
room
not
for
great
sympathy
but
some
and
if
there
was
only
sympathy
of
a
matter
two
years
or
three
mr.
tucker
would
now
be
have
finished
his
sentence,
it
appears.
the
third
circuit
cases,
the
district
court
cases
from
the
third
circuit
have
developed
a
theory
of
relief
given
on
2255
in
habeas
corpus
“that
it
is
only
fair
and
just
to
return
a
sentence
to
the
sentencing
judge
for
reconsideration
when
it
appears
after
sentencing
that
the
man,
the
defendant,
has
served
time
in
prison
on
wrongful
convictions.”
a
thought
as
i
believe
to
give
a
little
mercy
to
make
up
for
this
wrong
that
has
been
done
to
him
which
cannot
be
righted
in
any
other
way
and
certainly
insofar
as
fact
there
is
retribution
and
deterrence
of
others
two
of
the
four
factors
that
are
frequently
considered
at
sentencing,
so
far
as
they
are
involved,
there
is
room
for
mercy
because
of
the
prior
time
in
prison
and
in
mr.
tucker’s
case
not
only
was
he
in
prison,
he
was
on
a
chain
gang
for
five-and-a-half
years
and
what
that
means
i
do
not
know.
one
other
point
in
respect
to
a
passage
on
page
24,
mr.
chief
justice
is
concerning
you
is
that
mr.
tucker
in
1953
may
never
have
consulted
with
an
attorney
about
his
criminal
responsibility
for
this
1938
robbery.
now,
on
the
basis
of
my
correspondence
with
him
which
i
am
not
going
to
go
into
because
there
off
the
record,
i
think
that
he
might
have
developed
a
duress
defense.
if
he
had
had
the
chance
to
talk
with
an
attorney
about
this
and
while
he
admits,
“i
broke
into
it,
i
stole
the
car,”
it
does
not
negate
a
possible
defense
that
would
limit
the
criminal
responsibility
and
not
make
him
see
less
evil
in
the
eye
or
less
wicked
in
the
eye
of
judge
harris
in
1953
when
sentencing
occurred.
certainly,
some
further
explanation
of
what
happened
might
have
been
proper
and
also,
your
honor,
in
respect
to
the
florida
conviction,
the
fact
that
he
served
seven-and-a-half
years,
a
very
severe
sentence,
might
have
indicated
to
--
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
--
to
the
sentencing
judge
that
there
was
something
terribly
wrong,
would
not
to
you,
your
honors,
a
10
year-sentence
for
a
17
year-old
joy
ride.
something
terrible
wrong
seems
to
be
there,
a
very
vicious
crime.
mr.
tucker
may
have
felt
that
he
could
not
explain,
as
we
know,
he
felt
my
guilt
is
neither
here
nor
there
and
if
for
no
other
reason
then
to
allow
him
now
to
give
his
chance
to
explain
without
feeling
that
he
is
precluded
because
of
the
conclusiveness
of
a
conviction.
the
remand
order
is
appropriate
and
a
procedure
for
the
future
that
would
be
appropriate
is
to
require
or
direct
the
lower
courts
in
this
type
of
case
to
got
through
the
motions
which
do
not
take
very
long
and
which
do
not
require
an
evidentiary
hearing
of
explaining
as
was
done
in
pat
versus
united
states
in
the
fifth
circuit
of
explaining
why
there
is
a
denial.
and
this
would
permit
appellate
review
and
we
will
not
have
the
speculation
which
the
sentencing
judge
was
bothered
about
in
the
ninth
circuit.
thank
you.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
finally,
i
would
simply
repeat
that
it
is
quite
clear
to
the
government
in
this
case
that
any
problem
about
the
reliance
on
these
sentences,
the
questions
has
been
answered
by
the
judge
himself
when
he
said
--
when
he
denied
the
motion
to
reconsider
sentence
on
the
basis
of
the
use
of
those
priors
and
i
think,
no
useful
purpose
could
conceivably
served
by
asking
him
to
say
it
all
over
again.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
counsel
for
the
united
states
has
characterized
this
case
as
an
exclusionary
rule
of
case.
mr.
tucker
characterizes
the
case,
and
i
think
the
ninth
circuit,
majority
and
dissent
did
also
as
a
prejudicial
error
case
and
that
your
honors,
it
is,
so
long
as
gideon
versus
wainwright
is
retroactive.
the
reason
that
we
are
referring
both
counsels,
in
our
argument
so
often
to
the
record
and
reading
portions
of
the
record
to
the
court
is
that
whether
the
ninth
circuit
correctly
decided
this
case
turns
on
whether
this
record
offers
some
hint
that
an
injustice
occurred,
that
perhaps
the
sentence
would
have
been
lower
if
judge
harris,
in
1953,
had
realized
that
there
had
been
no
reliable
adjudication
of
guilt
of
the
three
prior
convictions,
1938,
1946
and
19
--
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
those
are
not
the
same
three
mr.
chief
justice.
they
were
used
both
--
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
well,
let
me
say
--
state
it
at
the
outset
that
mr.
tucker
as
you
will
note
in
his
in
propria
persona
written
opposition
to
writ
of
certiorari,
admits
guilt
of
one
of
those
three
priors.(voice
overlap)
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
no
sir,
it
is
not.
now,
you
notice
mr.
chief
justice
that
he
does
not
make
an
admission
as
to
the
1950
prior.
our
focus
here
is
on
his
statement,
“i
broke
in
and
stole
a
car.”
undoubtedly,
it
can
be
read
as
an
admission.
i
think
also
in
view
of
what
happened
and
how
this
came
up,
we
can
construe
this
portion
of
the
record
as
mr.
tucker
describing
himself
as
the
defendant,
describing
what
he
was
charged
with.
here
was
the
quandary
he
was
in.(voice
overlap)
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
not
at
all.
no
way.
we
do
not
view
the
ninth
circuit
ruling
in
anyway
as
precluding
the
court
upon
remand
from
considering
the
conduct.
in
fact,
the
ninth
circuit
majority's
concluding
paragraph
specifically
states
that
the
re-sentencing
is
to
occur
without
any
consideration
of
invalid
convictions
and
unquestionably,
if
this
re-sentencing
hearing
is
held,
the
conduct
involved
would
be
gone
into.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
yes,
but
for
two
reasons.
some
judges
in
the
exercise
of
their
discretion
at
sentencing,
simply
do
not
consider
charges
in
proof
of
guilt
other
than
a
conviction.
the
authorities
which
are
recited
in
respondent’s
brief
make
that
clear.
the
particular
reason
is
not
given.
it
seems
to
be
a
compartmentalization
by
the
judge,
a
rule
of
thumb.
i
consider
convictions.
i
do
not
consider
charges
which
have
not
resulted
in
a
conviction.
in
connecticut,
for
example,
the
judges
do
not
consider
charges
that
have
not
resulted
in
a
conviction.
now,
how
judge
harris
approach
this?
we
can
only
speculate
as.
we
know
that
he
would
not
consider
the
los
angeles
charge
because
that
was
coming
up
to
trial,
and
what
he
is
stated
and
what
mr.
tuttle
read
on
page
37
as
to
the
northern
california
charges
in
state
court,
i
would
submit
it
is
simply
ambiguous.
it
maybe
saying,
“i
know,
i
am
giving
a
heavy
sentence
on
the
basis
of
what
occurred
and
i
do
realize
that
it
maybe
increased,
but
i
hope
it
would
not
be.
i
think
that
the
remand
procedure
would
bring
the
clarification
that
we
want”
and
finally
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
mister
--
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
i
do
believe
you
do,
mr.
justice.
he
would
going
to
say
the
word
“both”
after
the
word
“of.”
if
you
notice
the
context
there,
he
describes
the
prior
convictions.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
“and
the
five
year
sentence
that
was
given
me,”
that
is
1950,
“i
was
convicted
by
a
judge,
the
same
judge
that
gave
me
the
five,
gave
me
the
10
to
start
with,”
that
is
1938
in
florida
“and
i
was
innocent
of”
and
he
stops.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
that
is
neither
here
and
there,
and
--
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
i
think
it
susceptible
of
the
interpretation
consistent
with
his
in
propria
persona
opposition
to
the
writ,
that
he
considers
both
of
his
florida
convictions
improper
in
that,
i
was
innocent
both
was
what
he
is
going
to
say.
but
now
that
we
have
read
this
passage
which
i
plan
to
read
later
to
the
court,
i
would
like
to
consider
why
mr.
tucker
stopped
his
explanation
on
elocution.
he
was
beginning
to
give
evidence
in
mitigation
to
explain
and
he
stops
suddenly
and
he
says
“that
is
neither
here
or
there”
and
there
are
things
to
be
only
two
possible
reasons
that
he
stopped.
what
the
first
one
is
that
he
realized
or
believed
that
the
convictions
then
subject
to
collateral
attack
because
gideon
had
not
been
decided,
were
conclusive
and
as
noted
in
respondent’s
brief,
there
was
considerable
authority
at
that
time
that
was
so.
whether
that
be
authority
that
commends
itself
to
out
logic,
it
seems
to
be
irrelevant
because
defense
counsel
who
was
there
at
sentencing
had
told
mr.
tucker
not
to
get
into
that.
the
other
possibility
is
that
mr.
tucker
felt
he
would
simply
irk
judge
harris
by
protesting
innocence
of
matters
by
which
he
stood
as
the
law
then
read
validly
convicted
and
judge
leventhal
of
the
dc
circuit
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
the
scott
case
which
is
cited
in
respondent’s
briefs,
states
that
the
overwhelming
majority
of
sentencing
judges
in
his
view
do
not
like
see
a
defendant
before
him
protesting
innocence
after
a
lawful
conviction.
so,
it
is
quite
possible
that
had
mr.
tucker
had
the
benefit
of
gideon
mr.
tucker
and
his
counsel
at
that
point,
he
would
not
have
stopped,
and
we
would
have
had
some
explanation
here
of
these
incidents,
the
1938
incident
when
he
was
17
and
the
1950
incident
in
florida,
and
it
is
reasonably
possible
that
he
might
have
been
convinced
judge
harris.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
have
corresponded
extensively
with
mr.
tucker
and
this
material
is
off
the
record,
i
wish
i
could
refer
to
it
before
you
now.
i
will
just
simply
say
this.
there
is
one
other
point
about
what
is
there
on
page
24.
this
statement
was
the
direct
result
of
a
burgett
versus
texas
error
that
mr.
tuttle
for
the
government
has
conceded.
it
was
found
by
the
district
court
to
be
a
burgett
versus
texas
error
to
receive
these
three
priors
at
the
guilt
determination.
it
was
found
by
the
northern
--
ninth
circuit
to
be
error.
burgett
has
been
retroactively
applied.
it
is
not
a
matter
we
have
briefed
here,
but
this
issue
is
before
the
court.
it
looks
at
page
24
of
the
transcript
here
and
to
determine
what
happened
because
that
is
a
poisonous
fruit
of
that
error.
in
it
came
the
three
priors
which
were
unreliable
and
un-counseled
and
the
poor
man
trying
to
rehabilitate
himself
in
the
eyes
of
the
jury
in
effect
confesses.
he
might
have
been
lying.
it
is
not
likely,
but
he
might
have
been.
maybe
he
might
have
decided
the
best
thing
to
do
was
take
advantage
of
his
age
which
was
17
and
to
try
to
get
some
sympathy
from
the
jury
by
in
effect
confessing
and
(voice
overlap).
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
yes,
and
before
the
jury.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
yes!
what
i
say
is
that
the
agent
is
present
in
court.
this
agent
in
effect
delivered
a
verbal
sentence
report.
so,
as
soon
as
when
that
began
the
sentencing
proceeding
has
begun.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
i
do
not
--mr.
tucker
would
be
out
of
prison,
sir,
to
begin
with,
but
assuming
that
the
time
difference
--
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
i
would
be
here.
if
he
was
willing
to
take
the
risk
of
north
carolina
versus
pearce
of
a
higher
sentence
and
go
back
in
there
and
ask
for
reconsideration,
i
would
be
here
because
i
think
that
the
remedy
that
commends
itself
to
the
court
and
a
remedy
which
is
followed
apparently
in
the
fifth
circuit
is
that
finding
should
be
made
by
the
sentencing
judge
as
to
how
he
was
affected
by
the
improper
material
before
him.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
well,
it
is
certainly
not
necessary
to
decided,
but
i
would
assume
so
that
what
the
court
wrote
there
permits
a
very
limited
consideration
of
prison
incident
so
long
is
there
actual
proof
of
them
and
they
are
not
hearsay.
on
the
procedural
matters
of
--
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
the
findings
i
feel
should
be
made
upon
a
section
2255
motion
if
it
is
a
federal
prisoner
or
upon
the
state
court
habeas
motion
when
a
state
prisoner
goes
before
the
judge
and
answers,
your
honor,
you
considered
information
that
was
wrong.
since
this
court
decided
townsend
versus
burke
in
1948,
there
have
been
perhaps
two
dozen
reported
cases
like
this
implying
the
townsend
versus
burke
principle
that
due
process
is
denied,
where
there
is
substantially
unreliable
information
before
the
judge
and
the
uniform
procedure
seems
to
be,
your
honor,
to
send
the
petition
back
to
the
sentencing
judge
if
he
is
available
and
get
some
findings
from
him,
if
he
can
reconstruct
it,
as
to
how
he
was
effected
and
i
would
assume,
if
he
cannot
reconstruct
it,
he
should
make
findings
as
to
his
normal
practice
in
dealing
with
prior
conviction
and
arrests.
because
as
noted,
particularly
in
the
annotation
in
alr
that
i
have
cited,
where
the
annotation
went
quite
--
have
picked
up
sentencing
decisions
from
all
parts
of
the
country,
the
majority
approach
seems
to
be
to
simply
disregard
un-adjudicated
charges.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
it
would
be
useful
if
he
made
it
then,
but
it
is
not
necessary.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
i
would
not
compel
it
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
well,
it
is
not
necessary
that
this
federal
case
here
be
extended
to
the
states
because
this
is
a
federal
conviction
and
it
is
arises
under
2255
which
allows
for
a
non
constitutional
collateral
attack
on
the
sentence.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
and
if
your
feeling
is
that
you
wish
to
limit
this
principle
to
the
federal
judicial
system,
i
think
it
is
quite
proper
to
do
so
and
if
there
is
precedent
would
be
(inaudible)
case
in
the
court
of
appeals
which
i
have
cited
cited
in
respondent’s
brief.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
i
am
certainly
sure
that
is
so,
but
i
am
not
certain
--
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
well,
i
was
not
aware
of
that,
but
i
think
that
the
--
regardless
of
what
procedure
was
originally
used
at
sentencing,
the
procedure
mentioned
in
the
fifth
circuit
decision
of
pat
versus
united
states
in
1966
is
the
desirable
procedure
to
handle
a
collateral
attack.
now,
in
the
pat
case
there
was
a
federal
prisoner,
a
direct
prisoner
is
sentenced
in
a
federal
prison
and
he
submitted
a
2255
motion
in
which
he
alleged
that
the
sentencing
judge
had
before
him
on
the
pre-sentence
report
an
entry
that
this
man
had
been
convicted
of
burglary
and
an
entry
that
this
man
had
raped
someone,
a
girl
and
the
judge
took
this,
and
i
believe,
although
it
is
not
clear,
without
holding
an
evidentiary
hearing
or
without
appointing
counsel,
he
obtained
the
record
of
the
sentencing
and
he
made
extensive
findings
as
to
what
he
would
have
done
or
how
he
would
reacted,
had
the
entries
been
false
and
had
he
no
match,
and
his
conclusion
was
that
there
was
so
much
other
criminal
activity
on
the
record
that
he
would
have
given
the
same
sentence
in
any
event
because
the
additional
burglary
and
the
additional
rape
did
not
make
that
much
difference.
now,
that
maybe
true
in
our
case.
there
was
a
lot
of
criminal
activity,
but
i
do
not
see
any
reason
why
it
is
too
much
to
ask
of
judge
harris,
who
was
still
sitting,
to
make
these
types
of
findings.
i
feel
that
he
ought
to
have
done
so
when
the
motion
originally
came
up
to
him.
as
mr.
tuttle
has
indicated,
mr.
tucker
the
prisoner,
and
respondent
here
in
propria
persona
filed
a
petition
under
burgett
versus
texas
attacking
the
conviction
itself,
on
the
basis
of
what
we
have
read
at
page
24
and
what
preceded
it
when
the
priors
were
introduced
to
impeach
him.
he
did
not
in
his
original
moving
papers
mentioned
the
sentence.
the
government
did
not
in
its
reply
papers
mentioned
the
sentence.
the
judge
then
wrote
the
opinion
which
is
in
the
appendix
which
does
not
mention
sentencing
at
all.
the
opinion
relies
heavily
on
the
record
to
indicate
that
as
far
as
impeachment
went,
there
was
harmless
error
because
the
man
was
thoroughly,
mr.
tucker
was
thoroughly,
discredited
on
rebuttal
evidence
and
this
is
true
and
then,
after
this
opinion
came
down
from
judge
harris,
mr.
tucker
filed
what
he
labeled
a
petition
for
rehearing
which
goes
on
for
several
pages
laying
out
what
happened
at
sentencing
and
requesting
sentencing.
and
mr.
tuttle
has
accurately
described
judge
harris’
response
to
that,
a
truce
order
saying
rehearing
denied,
the
petition
raises
no
new
issue
that
warrants
reconsideration.
and
it
was
a
new
issue
if
the
court
please,
because
instead
of
weighing
the
priors
as
impeaching
devices
against
the
testimony
of
guilt
and
the
discrediting
testimony,
the
judge
should
have
then
weighed
the
priors
as
evidence
of
guilt
against
the
other
evidence
of
guilt
that
was
done
in
the
pat
case
to
see
if
it
would
have
made
any
difference.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
i
would
suggest
that
if
that
judge
were
available
perhaps
in
retirement.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
if
he
is
deceased,
the
--
a
sentencing
judge
or
district
court
judge
hearing
a
2255
motion
can
only
put
himself
in
the
position
of
a
sentencing
judge
and
said
would
not
have
affected
me
and
i
do
believe
mister
--
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
if
the
opinion
is
why
should
not
this
court?
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
that
would
be
proper
and
it
would
seem
that
he
is
at
the
sentencing
court,
he
can
do
the
re-sentencing
himself.
on
the
other
hand,
he
could
simply
reach
the
same
result
if
the
re-sentencing
was
not
to
decrease
the
term.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
he
would
put
on
a
new
role
by
what
i
understand.
i
am
not
certain
how
it
is
done,
but
i
would
not
think
that
the
sentencing
judge
was
gone
and
we
were
in
the
particular
district
and
division
where
he
was
sentenced.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
counsel
would
--
at
sentencing
counsel
would
be
available.
the
pat
case
lends
itself
to
the
point
that
no
evidentiary
hearing
need
be
required
in
cases
where
the
sentencing
judge
can
state
with
the
assurance
that
he
was
not
affected,
the
procedure
in
the
pat
case
of
the
fifth
circuit
and
perhaps
this
problem
never
would
arisen
if
judge
harris
had
only
instead
of
denying
that
re-hearing
petition
made
some
findings.
they
could
have
been
so
conclusive
on
the
point
that
mr.
tucker
would
not
have
no
basis
for
appeal.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
he
could
have
misunderstood
what
mr.
tucker
was
seeking.
i
would
--
the
papers
are
rather
clearer
it
would
seem
but
the
statement
there
is
no
new
issue
is
wrong
and
suggest
perhaps
a
misunderstanding.
now,
on
the
--
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
petition
for
re-hearing.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
if
he
had
read
it
--
if
he
had
read
it
casually.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
in
all
candor
though
mr.
justice
brennan,
it
is
a
well
written
petition
for
rehearing
and
judge
harris
should
not
have
mistaken
it
for
it
was.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
i
think
that
has
procedural
error
in
that
we
simply
do
not
have
a
record
or
appeal
and
it
is
simply
a
matter
of
the
desirable
procedure
to
cut
down
on
the
appeals
that
go
on
in
the
22
--
collateral
attack
proceedings.
it
is
best
for
this
court
and
as
the
ninth
circuit
seems
to
indicate
it
once
for
to
require
the
sentencing
judge
to
take
whatever
time
it
takes,
20
minutes
--
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
that
maybe
so,
when
it
simply
says
denied,
but
here
we
have
raises
no
new
issue
and
yet
on
the
face
of
it
there
is
the
potential
for
prejudice.
it
is
possible
that
judge
harris
believed
that
mr.
tucker
was
guilty
of
these
three
prior
convictions
and
as
the
two
of
them
if
he
had
not
felt
that
it
was
neither
here
nor
there,
if
he
had
known
of
his
right
to
collateral
attack,
he
might
have
convinced
the
judge
and
received
a
lesser
sentence.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
he
is
still
there.
we
object.[laughter]
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
yes
it
was,
the
maximum.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
he
remains
in
the
federal
prison
in
washington
and
although,
he
states
that
he
is
entitled
to
release
in
1972,
mr.
tuttle
advices
that
he
has
to
check
with
the
bureau
of
prisons
and
that
the
mandatory
release
date
appears
to
be
1973.
so,
there
is
some
uncertainty
about
that.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
no,
he
has
not,
your
honor
as
i
understand
it.
i
have
been
receiving
mail
from
him
--
from
steilacoom
in
washington,
d.c.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
judge
harris
is
the
only
district
judge
involved
in
this
case
at
all
proceedings,
the
trial,
the
sentencing,
the
2255,
it
is
the
same
judge
throughout.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
not
at
all,
your
honor.
it
had
there
--
the
two
points
i
am
making
are,
that
he
should
have
taken
into
account
under
the
proper
context.
if
it
was
--
if
he
knew
that
this
man
was
speaking
about
these
convictions
under
the
belief
that
he
was
conclusively
presumed
guilty,
he
might
have
discounted
it
because
the
fact
the
man
believes
he
is
conclusively
presumed
guilty
rather
limits
his
explanation
as
he
cut
himself
off
by
saying
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
when
he
started
to
go
into
an
explanation.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
a
man
does
not
contest
his
guilt
of
the
jewelry
store
robbery.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
the
1946
jewelry
store
robbery;
he
does
and
he
never
did
admit
at
any
point
in
the
proceedings
guilt
of
the
1950
florida
conviction
and
as
mr.
tuttle
has
noted,
judge
harris
has
never
rule
on
its
validity,
although,
the
validity
of
question
was
before
judge
harris
and
for
that
reason.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
no.
he
is
not.
he
is
on
parole
on
--
if
he
violates
his
parole,
he
is.
he
is
on
parole
on
a
conviction
one
set
of
robberies.
as
to
the
other
set
of
robberies,
the
appendix
to
respondent's
brief
indicates
that
the
charges
where
dismissed
and
they
cannot
be
brought
again
because
to
my
believe,
because
of
the
statute
of
limitations
in
california.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
i
am
not
certain
--
i
do
not
think
the
record
indicates
which
bank
robbery
occurred
at
what
point
in
time.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
one
of
the
most
federal,
excuse
me?
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
yes,
--
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
it
is
extremely
ambiguous
mr.
justice
white,
what
judge
harris
said
he
would
not
consider.
it
is
very
clear
that
he
was
not
going
to
consider
the
los
angeles
charges.
now,
what
--
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
yes,
he
was.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
i
am
not
certain
whether
he
was
serving,
whether
was
moved
down
to
a
california
prison
to
serve
the
two
federal
and
state
sentences
consecutively.
i
do
know
that
the
one’s
that
he
is
not
on
the
parole
out
on
which
he
is
not
on
parole
are
those
which
are
discussed
in
the
appendix
to
the
brief.
i
would
like
a
little
briefly
in
argument
to
the
point
made
in
part
3
of
respondent's
brief
and
that
is
that
judge
harris
in
1953
when
he
was
sentencing
petitioner
had
no
way
to
know
that
petitioner
had
previously
spent
eleven-and-half-years
in
prison
wrongfully
because
of
unreliable
convictions,
convictions
which
were
made
without
counsel.
perhaps
the
judge
would
have
want
to
have
shown
some
leniency.
now,
we
have
the
statement
at
the
bottom
of
page
35
of
the
appendix,
“there
is
no
room
for
the
court
to
entertain
elements
of
great
sympathy”
because
mr.
tucker
was
using
a
gun,
even
though
he
did
not
point
it
to
anyone,
but
there
was
some
room
not
for
great
sympathy
but
some
and
if
there
was
only
sympathy
of
a

mr.

would

finished
his
sentence,
it
appears.
the
third
circuit
cases,
the
district
court
cases
from
the
third
circuit
have
developed
a
theory
of
relief
given
on
2255
in
habeas
corpus
“that
it
is
only
fair
and
just
to
return
a
sentence
to
the
sentencing
judge
for
reconsideration
when
it
appears
after
sentencing
that
the
man,
the
defendant,
has
served
time
in
prison
on
wrongful
convictions.”
a
thought
as
i
believe
to
give
a
little
mercy
to
make
up
for
this
wrong
that
has
been
done
to
him
which
cannot
be
righted
in
any
other
way
and
certainly
insofar
as
fact
there
is
retribution
and
deterrence
of
others
two
of
the
four
factors
that
are
frequently
considered
at
sentencing,
so
far
as
they
are
involved,
there
is
room
for
mercy
because
of
the
prior
time
in
prison
and
in
mr.
tucker’s
case
not
only
was
he
in
prison,
he
was
on
a
chain
gang
for
five-and-a-half
years
and
what
that
means
i
do
not
know.
one
other
point
in
respect
to
a
passage
on
page
24,
mr.
chief
justice
is
concerning
you
is
that
mr.
tucker
in
1953
may
never
have
consulted
with
an
attorney
about
his
criminal
responsibility
for
this
1938
robbery.
now,
on
the
basis
of
my
correspondence
with
him
which
i
am
not
going
to
go
into
because
there
off
the
record,
i
think
that
he
might
have
developed
a
duress
defense.
if
he
had
had
the
chance
to
talk
with
an
attorney
about
this
and
while
he
admits,
“i
broke
into
it,
i
stole
the
car,”
it
does
not
negate
a
possible
defense
that
would
limit
the
criminal
responsibility
and
not
make
him
see
less
evil
in
the
eye
or
less
wicked
in
the
eye
of
judge
harris
in
1953
when
sentencing
occurred.
certainly,
some
further
explanation
of
what
happened
might
have
been
proper
and
also,
your
honor,
in
respect
to
the
florida
conviction,
the
fact
that
he
served
seven-and-a-half
years,
a
very
severe
sentence,
might
have
indicated
to
--
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
--
to
the
sentencing
judge
that
there
was
something
terribly
wrong,
would
not
to
you,
your
honors,
a
10
year-sentence
for
a
17
year-old
joy
ride.
something
terrible
wrong
seems
to
be
there,
a
very
vicious
crime.
mr.
tucker
may
have
felt
that
he
could
not
explain,
as
we
know,
he
felt
my
guilt
is
neither
here
nor
there
and
if
for
no
other
reason
then
to
allow
him
now
to
give
his
chance
to
explain
without
feeling
that
he
is
precluded
because
of
the
conclusiveness
of
a
conviction.
the
remand
order
is
appropriate
and
a
procedure
for
the
future
that
would
be
appropriate
is
to
require
or
direct
the
lower
courts
in
this
type
of
case
to
got
through
the
motions
which
do
not
take
very
long
and
which
do
not
require
an
evidentiary
hearing
of
explaining
as
was
done
in
pat
versus
united
states
in
the
fifth
circuit
of
explaining
why
there
is
a
denial.
and
this
would
permit
appellate
review
and
we
will
not
have
the
speculation
which
the
sentencing
judge
was
bothered
about
in
the
ninth
circuit.
thank
you.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
finally,
i
would
simply
repeat
that
it
is
quite
clear
to
the
government
in
this
case
that
any
problem
about
the
reliance
on
these
sentences,
the
questions
has
been
answered
by
the
judge
himself
when
he
said
--
when
he
denied
the
motion
to
reconsider
sentence
on
the
basis
of
the
use
of
those
priors
and
i
think,
no
useful
purpose
could
conceivably
served
by
asking
him
to
say
it
all
over
again.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
william
a.
reppy,
jr.
thank
you
very
much.
