would
you
raise
your
voice
a
little
mr.

chief

now
is
this
surveillance,
this
pattern
of
surveillance
traceable
back
to
the
directive
which
president
roosevelt
gave
to
attorney
general

in
this
area?
chief

a
risk
mr.

in
getting
in
--
tying

here.
how

chief

probably
if

surveillance
of
an
embassy
they
would
have
to
do
the
same
thing
in
their
view,
is
that
correct?
chief

foreign

employs
people

lived
here
whether
citizens
or

domestic
operations?
chief

would
you
view,

take
it
to
a

could
not
issue
a
