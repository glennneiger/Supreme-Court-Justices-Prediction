mr.
robert
c.
mardian
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arises
from
a
criminal
proceeding
which
is
now
pending
in
the
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
michigan,
in
which
the
three
defendants
were
charge
with
a
conspiracy
to
destroy
government
property.
one
of
the
defendants,
the
defendant
plamondon
was
also
charged
the
substant
violation
of
destroying
government
property.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes,
sir.
the
indictments
in
this
case
resulted
from
the
dynamite
bombing
of
the
offices
of
the
central
intelligence
agency
building
in
ann
arbor,
michigan.
during
the
course
of
the
pretrial
proceedings,
motion
was
made
for
discovery
of
information
relating
to
electronic
surveillance
that
might
be
in
possession
of
the
government.
in
response
to
this
motion,
the
government
served
upon
the
movements
an
affidavit
of
the
attorney
general
of
united
states,
in
which
he
acknowledged
that
one
to
the
defendants,
the
defendant
plamondon,
had
been
overheard
in
the
course
of
a
surveillance
authorized
by
him
in
which
he
deemed
necessary
in
the
interest
of
the
national
security
united
states.
the
affidavits
stated
that
the
disclosure
of
this
information
would
be
prejudicial
to
the
interest
of
united
states.
in
addition
to
serving
the
affidavit
on
the
movements
and
filing
it
with
the
court,
the
government
also
submitted
to
the
court
for
its
in
camera
inspection,
the
logs
of
the
over
hearings
requested
by
the
defendants,
included
in
that
in
that
in
camera
submission,
the
government
also
offered
the
of
--
the
proof
of
the
authorization
to
the
attorney
general
of
united
states
for
the
surveillance
and
question
conducted
prior
to
the
time
of
the
bombing.
the
in
camera
exhibit
will
show,
which
is
now
before
this
court,
that
it
contains
a
memorandum
from
the
director
of
the
fbi
to
the
attorney
general,
in
which
he
sets
forth
all
of
the
electric
--
electronic
surveillances
operated
by
the
government
at
that
time,
approved
by
the
attorney
general
or
by
the
former
attorney
general.
prior
to
submission
however,
the
government
excised
the
names
of
the
organizations
and
individuals
which
were
the
subject
of
surveillance
with
the
exception
of
the
organization
which
this
--
which
was
the
subject
of
surveillance
in
this
case.
that
in
camera
submission
will
also
show,
a
characterization
in
the
form
of
the
memorandum
from
the
director
of
the
fbi
to
the
attorney
general,
the
organization
in
question,
its
leadership
and
its
illegal
aims
and
information
relating
to
the
fact
that
the
organization
was
engaged
in
activities
of
a
type
which
would
ultimately
lead
to
the
destruction
for
the
united
states
government
before
some
violence.
this
in
camera
submission
would
also
show
that
the
authorization
of
the
attorney
general
was
for
a
limited
period
only.
it
described
the
premises
where
the
installation
surveillance
was
involved
and
indicated
that
the
surveillance
was
subject
to
periodic
review.
based
upon
this
in
camera
submission,
the
united
states
urged
that
the
surveillance
and
question
was
lawful.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
pardon
me,
sir,
i
didn’t
--
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
government
urged
that
this
was
a
lawful
surveillance
exercised
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
president
united
states
and
--
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes,
your
honor.
the
government’s
position
based
upon
this
in
camera
submission
and
the
affidavit
of
the
attorney
general
was
at
the
surveillance.
it
was
a
lawful
as
reasonable
exercise
of
the
presidential
powers
in
the
area
of
national
security.
the
district
court
after
reviewing
the
in
camera
submission
and
i
should
point
out
in
this
regard,
that
the
in
camera
submission
was
not
intended
as
a
justification
for
the
authorization
but
simply
of
proof
of
the
fact
that
the
authorization
had
been
granted
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
over
his
own
signature.
the
respondent
court,
judge
keith,
held
based
upon
the
affidavit
and
the
in
camera
submission
that
the
overhearing
should
be
disclosed
to
the
defendants
as
a
plaintiff
to
an
evidentiary
hearing
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
information
contained
on
the
logs
contributed
in
any
ways
to
the
prosecution
of
the
defendant
plamondon.
it
took
--
made
this
holding
on
the
basis
that
the
president
of
united
states
was
without
authority
to
authorize
a
surveillance
absent
--
the
judicial
in
a
position
of
a
warrant
by
sitting
a
federal
judge.
the
united
states
immediately
petitioned
for
a
writ
of
mandamus
to
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
the
sixth
circuit
unanimously
held
that
mandamus
was
an
appropriate
remedy
but
by
a
divided
court
concurred
in
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
on
the
basis,
in
the
words
of
justice
edwards,
that
there
was
not
one
phrase
or
word
in
the
constitution
in
the
united
states,
in
the
statutory
law
of
united
states
or
the
case
law
of
the
united
states
that
exempted
the
president
of
united
states
from
the
provisions
of
the
fourth
amendment.
we
do
not
contend
here,
your
honors
that
the
president
of
the
united
states
either
individually
or
acting
through
the
attorney
general
is
exempt
from
the
provisions
of
the
fourth
amendment
or
is
above
the
provisions
of
the
constitution.
we
do
suggest
that
this
case
puts
into
issue
an
intelligence
function
and
procedure
which
has
been
sanctioned
by
six
successive
presidents
acting
through
12
successive
attorneys
general.
and
while
the
constitutional
issue
is
grave
and
the
stakes
as
far
as
the
government
are
concerned
is
high,
the
issue
before
the
court
can
be
easily
framed.
stated
negatively,
the
question
is
not
whether
electronic
surveillance
is
a
permissible
governmental
tool.
more
narrowly
claimed,
the
question
is
whether
in
a
limited
area
of
counterintelligence
activities,
the
president
of
the
united
states
may
authorize
electronic
surveillance
in
the
absence
of
a
warrant
by
a
member
of
the
judiciary
of
this
nation.
in
order
to
understand
the
case
and
to
properly
resolve
it,
i
think
we
must
first
understand
the
factual
setting
as
distinguished
from
the
other
cases
that
have
been
before
this
court.
this
is
not
a
case
such
as
the
katz
case
or
the
black
case
or
o’brian
or
alderman,
where
electronic
surveillance
was
authorized
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
prosecutive
evidence
in
a
criminal
proceeding.
nor
is
it
a
case
as
in
those
cases
where
the
defendant
was
the
target
of
the
electronic
surveillance
which
was
authorized.
we
have
here
as
we
had
in
the
clay
case,
a
situation
where
one
of
the
defendants
unfortuitously
or
fortuitously
depending
upon
the
outcome
of
this
case
happen
to
dial
a
number
which
was
the
subject
of
a
surveillance
authorized
by
the
president
of
the
united
states
acting
through
the
attorney
general.
the
government
contends
contrary
to
the
distinction
made
by
the
lower
court,
that
the
president
of
the
united
states
is
imbued
with
two
powers
in
order
to
carry
out
two
responsibilities.
both
lower
courts
distinguished
the
clay
case
on
the
grounds
that
the
power
exercised
in
that
case
was
an
aid
of
the
powers
of
the
president
in
the
area
of
foreign
affairs
related
that
power
to
defending
the
interest
of
the
united
states
against
the
acts
of
hostile
foreign
powers.
united
states
urges
that
they
--
these
two
powers
are
separate
and
distinct.
the
one
power
or
the
power
of
the
president
in
the
area
of
foreign
affairs
is
granted
upon
the
fact
that
the
president
is
the
exclusive
national
organ
of
the
united
states
in
the
area
of
foreign
affairs.
the
other
power
is
granted
upon
the
responsibility
and
obligation
of
the
president
to
protect
the
security
of
the
united
states
against
its
enemies
whether
foreign
or
domestic.
because
counterintelligence
activities
often
involved
both
powers,
there’s
some
confusion
has
come
to
exist.
in
counterintelligence
activities
involved
in
the
area
of
foreign
affairs.
the
purpose
is
to
--
purpose
of
the
surveillance
is
to
permit
the
president
of
united
states
to
obtain
the
ongoing
intelligence
information
which
is
necessary
to
him
to
compete
on
at
least
an
equal
footing
with
the
information
obtained
by
foreign
powers
with
whom
he
has
to
deal.
in
the
area
of
national
security
however,
the
intelligence
that
is
sought
is
for
an
entirely
different
purpose
and
the
power
and
responsibility
are
grounded
upon
the
president’s
function
in
protecting
the
national
security
against
the
enemies
of
the
united
states
whether
foreign
or
domestic.
out
of
this
confusion
in
dichotomy,
the
cases
have
discussed
both
powers
as
if
they
were
one,
and
i
think
these
case
points
up
most
eloquently
the
confusion
which
has
existed
between
foreign
and
domestic
intelligence.
the
government
contends
that
as
a
legal
and
as
a
practical
matter
you
cannot
distinguish
between
foreign
and
domestic
intelligence
unless
you
use
the
situs
of
the
installation
as
a
basis
for
making
a
distinction.
both
lower
courts
however
were
not
confused
with
this
problem.
they
did
not
reach
it.
the
respondent
court
grounded
its
decision
on
the
basis
that
the
intelligence
function
exercised
here
was
for
the
purpose
of
surveiling
a
domestic
organization
and
failed
to
distinguish
the
difference
between
surveiling
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
intelligence
information
as
distinguished
from
the
nature
of
the
organization
from
which
the
intelligence
was
sought.
we
suggest
also
that
the
constitutional
authority
of
the
president
is
not
found
in
any
one
provision
or
any
one
article
but
may
be
gleaned
from
the
constitution
as
a
whole
and
i
speak
now
only
for
the
constitutional
authority
of
the
president
in
the
area
of
national
security
affairs.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
the
congress
has
undoubted
authority
in
the
area
of
national
security,
i
think
you,
as
pointed
out
in
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
national
lawyers
guild
and
the
black
panther
party
in
article
1
section
15.
the
constitution
provides
the
states
that
the
congress
shall
provide
for
the
calling
of
the
militia
of
the
united
states
in
the
event
of
insurrection.
the
amicus
brief
asserts
that
because
of
this
provision,
the
congress
of
the
united
states
as
distinguished
from
the
president
is
--
has
fair
amount
authority
in
the
area
of
the
internal
affairs
of
the
country.
i
would
point
out
in
that
regard
that
the
second
congress
confederates
of
the
provision
of
article
1
section
15,
did
provide
for
the
calling
of
the
militia
and
repose
that
responsibility
in
the
president
of
the
united
states,
post
statutes
enacted
it
the
second
congress
now
subsist
in
10
u.s.c.
1031
and
1032.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
i
would
agree,
your
honor.
in
fact
i
think
in
this
area
as
the
court
--
this
court
pointed
out
in
colonnade
catering,
the
congress
the
united
states
has
broad
powers.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes,
in
fashioning
a
rule
of
reasonableness
under
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
i
think
this
type
of
activity
your
honor
is
peculiarly
within
the
executive
function.
i
would
like
--
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
i
would
not
wish
to
state
at
this
argument,
your
honor.
that
it
is
within
the
exclusive
province
of
the
president
of
united
states
but
only
that
this
type
of
activity
is
peculiarly
within
the
executive
function
which
i
would
hope
to
show.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
that
issue
is
not
before
this
court
and
--
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
i
think
under
the
rule
announced
by
this
court
in
colonnade
catering
that
within
certain
limits,
the
congress
could
severely
restrict
the
power
of
the
president
in
this
area.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
i
think
that
congress
has
already
provided
the
--
that
in
the
--
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes,
i
would
concur
on
that,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
as
i
try
to
suggest
the
affidavit,
it
was
never
intended
as
the
basis
for
justifying
the
surveillance
in
question.
the
affidavit
--
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
the
affidavit
was
filed
with
the
movements.
the
justification
and
again
i
suggest
it
--
is
only
a
partial
justification
as
contained
in
the
in
camera
exhibit
which
was
submitted
to
judge
keith.
i
think
where
the
attorney
general
to
set
forth
any
--
everything
that
--
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
no,
sir.
and
we
do
not
rely
upon
the
affidavit
itself
with
the
in
camera
exhibit.
i
think
the
in
camera
will
show
in
the
characterization
of
the
organization
involved
which
was
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
at
the
time
the
director
of
the
fbi
sought
authority
from
him
to
engage
in
the
surveillance
that
the
organization
involved
was
in
--
then
engaged
--
enacts
activities
which
they
hope
would
ultimately
result
in
the
destruction
of
our
form
of
government
by
means
of
illegal
force.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes
sir.[lunch
recess]
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
noon
recess,
i
prepared
to
continue
my
response
to
mr.
justice
white
and
i
would
like
to
finish
the
answer
to
my
question
if
i
may
and
with
respect
to
the
in
camera
submission,
your
honor.
the
in
camera
submission
to
the
court
was
intended
for
the
purpose
of
satisfying
the
court
as
to
the
authorization
of
the
attorney
general
of
united
states
in
the
finding
of
the
attorney
general.
i
would
like
to
point
out
in
this
regard
--
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes,
that
the
in
camera
document
which
the
attorney
general
signed
which
contained
the
authorization
from
the
surveillance
in
question.
i
should
like
to
point
out
that
the
--
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes.
in
the
procedures
then
followed
which
if
you
recall
this
case
arose
out
of
a
bombing
that
occurred
in
september
1968
and
the
indictment
return
in
1969.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
i
would
concur
in
that,
your
honor.
i
think
you
will
find
that
the
authorization
which
requested
contained
that
information
and
was
approved
and
signed
by
the
attorney
general
of
united
states.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
i
think
that
is
satisfied
by
the
signature
of
the
attorney
general
approving
the
authorization
based
upon
the
evidence
which
is
contained
in
the
request
of
authorization.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
the
requested
authorization
states
that
it’s
requested
because
it
does
pose
a
clear
and
present
danger
to
destruction
existence
of
government
and
the
attorney
general
approved
that
statement.
procedures
now
in
existence
are
different
and
would
contain
an
expressed
finding
to
that
effect
directed
to
the
director
of
the
fbi.
i
would
like
to
point
out
--
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
no,
i
would
say
that
it
would
be
conclusionary,
your
honor
more
than
setting
forth
each
specific
fact.
we
keep
in
mind
the
decision-making
process
in
this
area
is
based
upon
the
entire
spectrum
of
intelligence
information
available
to
the
attorney
general
and
not
only
the
information
supplied
in
by
the
director
of
the
fbi.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
limited
judicial
review
i
would
say,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
in
this
area,
i
think
the
review
should
--
is
limited
to
a
determination
of
whether
or
not
there
was
a
gross
abuse
of
discretion
by
the
attorney
general
acting
for
the
president
and
making
the
authorization.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
well
--
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
i
would
say,
your
honor
that
this
goes
right
to
the
heart
of
a
matter.
in
this
area,
certain
of
the
information
which
is
available,
all
of
the
information
which
is
available
to
the
attorney
general
of
united
states
and
through
him
to
the
president
is
not
available
to
each
investigative
agency
of
government.
there
is
an
entire
spec
--
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
all
of
that
information
is
not
made
available
to
the
courts.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
we
suggest
that
in
the
limited
area
of
counterintelligence
activities
of
government
as
distinguished
from
the
situation
where
a
warrant
is
sought
for
prosecutive
purposes.
that
the
executive
function
in
this
area
is
somewhat
limited
and
that
where
the
president
of
united
states
acting
through
the
attorney
general
or
the
attorney
general
himself
or
one
of
his
subordinates
to
lay
before
a
sitting
federal
judge
of
the
entire
spectrum
of
information
consisting
of
teletypes,
letterhead
memorandum
and
all
of
the
information
that
comes
from
not
only
the
fbi
but
from
other
agencies
such
as
the
central
intelligence
agency,
the
national
security
agency,
the
alcohol-tobacco
and
firearms
division
of
the
department
of
treasury,
and
other
investigative
agencies
of
the
government.
all
of
these
are
reposed,
all
this
information
is
reposed
and
files
in
the
attorney
general
of
united
states
before
he
makes
the
authorization
or
grants
the
authorization
requested,
and
i
would
point
--
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
i
think
as
we
attempt
to
show
in
our
brief
the
function
of
the
courts
--
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes,
sir.
the
function
of
the
federal
judge
in
criminal
cases
is
twofold.
one,
the
judge
must
determine
the
need
for
the
evidence
sought.
he
then
must
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
crime
has
been
committed
or
is
about
to
be
committed
before
he
authorizes
the
warrant.
now,
the
first
of
this
decisions
is
to
whether
the
information
is
needed
such
as
in
the
area
of
national
security,
counterintelligence
information,
if
you
please.
it
is
the
government’s
position
that
the
magistrate,
the
sitting
federal
judge
is
not
in
a
position
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
information
is
needed
much
less
appreciate
in
many
cases
the
importance
of
the
information
sought
unless
that
is
to
be
exposed
to
that
judge
along
with
any
one
of
over
600
federal
sitting
judges,
all
of
the
information
available
to
the
executive
in
the
area
of
national
security.
in
this
connection,
justice
--
rather
professor
telford
taylor
addressed
himself
to
the
problem
in
connection
not
with
national
security
intelligence,
counterintelligence
if
you
please,
but
with
respect
to
the
authority
of
the
judge
and
the
ability
of
the
judge
to
issue
a
warrant
in
an
ordinary
criminal
case.
and
if
i
may,
i’d
like
to
quote
from
professor
telford
taylor
and
not
that
i
ascribe
him
with
his
views
with
respect
to
warrants
issued
in
criminal
cases
but
he
says,
“what
proper
business
is
it
of
a
judge
and
what
experience
of
facilities
does
he
have
that
will
enable
him
to
decide
whether
or
not
surveillance
of
a
particular
type
is
warranted
in
a
particular
case.”
he
is
pointing
out
i
think
the
same
thing
that
was
pointed
out
in
the
report
of
the
committee
of
privy
councilors
when
they
addressed
themselves
to
this
question
in
england.
the
question
there
was,
whether
or
not
the
par
at
issue
warrants
for
electronics
surveillance
should
remain
in
the
secretary
of
state
or
should
be
reposed
in
the
federal
judiciary?
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
no,
but
i
think
the
privy
council
report
is
acutely
aware
of
the
right
of
privacy
as
it
exist
in
england
as
much
as
it
exist
in
the
united
states
and
it
addresses
itself
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
granting
of
this
authority
counterintelligence
cases
is
in
the
best
interest
of
the
right
of
privacy
of
the
individual
and
it
concludes
that
it
is
not.
it
concludes
in
its
report,
there
will
be
a
weakening
of
the
process.
that
there
will
be
a
diffusion
of
authority
to
anyone
of
the
federal
judiciary
or
the
judges
in
england
rather
than
reposing
that
responsibility
in
one
man
and
one
man
alone
and
we
would
suggest
that
the
interest
of
privacy
of
the
american
citizen
is
better
protected
in
limiting
this
authority
in
the
area
of
electronic
surveillance
and
counterintelligence
cases
to
one
man.
the
attorney
general
acting
for
the
president
of
the
united
states
rather
to
proliferate
it
amongst
all
of
the
federal
sitting
judges
in
united
states
and
we
say
that
not
in
connection
with
those
cases
where
the
judicial
process
is
one
of
the
determining
probable
cause.
but
only
in
those
cases
and
in
the
limited
area
of
counterintelligence
where
the
decision-making
process
requires
a
judgment
as
to
the
need
for
the
intelligence
information
sought
and
we
would
suggests
in
this
regard
also
that
information
obtained
by
the
government
for
counterintelligence
purposes
in
this
area
is
not
used
for
prosecutive
purposes
and
is
not
sought
for
prosecutive
purposes.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
i
believe
that
is
there
contention
but
i
think
that
in
camera
exhibit
will
show
beyond
question.
that
the
authorization
in
the
case
was
totally
unrelated
in
the
information
obtained
was
totally
unrelated
to
the
crime
for
which
this
defendants
where
indicted.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes,
sir.
i
think
in
camera
examination
will
disclose
as
the
fifth
circuit
found
in
the
clay
case
that
the
information
and
detained
in
the
logs
could
not
in
any
ways
of
a
--
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
the
burden
of
the
court
however
in
both
cases
is
the
same.
we
do
not
have
as
we
had
in
alderman
as
was
described
by
counsel
in
that
case,
case
loads
of
electronically
monitored
conversations
which
would
require
--
which
the
court
would
have
to
examine
in
juxtaposition
to
the
skeletal
averments
of
a
criminal
indictment.
we
have
as
the
counsel
in
the
alderman
case
suggested
not
even
sheaves
of
papers,
something
less
than
sheaves
of
paper.
not
unlike
jenks
act
materials,
not
unlike
grand
jury
minutes
which
this
court
as
could
the
circuit
court
and
the
district
court
have
examined
to
determine
that
the
overhearings
were
totally
unrelated
to
the
crime
for
which
these
people
where
indicted
and
i
think
that
beyond
question
in
camera
exhibit
will
show
that
the
purpose
of
the
surveillance
was
for
the
sole
and
limited
purpose
of
obtaining
counterintelligence
information
as
distinguished
from
prosecuted
evidence
in
a
criminal
case.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
i
think
it
would
apply
equally.
yes,
sir
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
i
think
in
the
–-
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
i
think
that
in
the
setting
of
this
case
the
burden
would
be
no
greater
than
the
burden
of
the
court,
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
clay
case.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
i
don’t
see
it
as
inconsistent
with
alderman.
i
think
the
facts
in
the
alderman
case
were
far
different
from
the
facts
of
this
case.
in
the
alderman
case,
as
counsel
pointed
out,
the
surveillance
was
authorized
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
prosecuted
evidence
to
be
used
in
the
criminal
case
and
it
was
directed
against
the
defendant.
and
as
in
that
case,
i
would
assume,
i
didn’t
look
at
the
record
that
there
were
literally
box
loads
of
electrically
monitored
telephone
conversations.
in
this
case,
we
have
a
situation
as
in
clay
where
as
i
have
said,
the
defendant
unfortuitously
or
fortuitously
depending
on
the
outcome
of
this
case
happened
to
call
the
wrong
number.
and
i
think
the
in
camera
examination
would
disclosed
that
fact.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
i
would
--
i
hope
to
get
to
that
and
i
would
concur
that
it
doesn’t.
i
would
like
if
i
made
a
turn
briefly
to
answer
the
assertion
of
lack
of
constitutional
authority
and
i
think
in
this
regard
we
must
recognized
the
constitution
authority
of
the
president
must
be
gleamed
for
a
reading
of
the
entire
constitution
itself.
and
i
should
like
if
i
may
to
address
myself
very
briefly
to
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
which
the
government
deems
applicable
to
this
case.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes,
sir.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
in
the
setting
of
this
case
i
would
rather
argue,
mr.
justice,
that
we
read
the
constitution
along
with
the
statutory
provision
and
that
in
itself
would
be
sufficient
for
the
presidential
authority
in
this
area.
i
think
absent
--
the
constitutional
enabling
act
or
the
congressional
enabling
act
that
we
would
have
a
more
difficult
case
but
i
think
in
that
case
as
i
hope
to
show
the
president
would
have
to
the
constitutional
authority
in
this
limited
area
to
engage
in
electronic
surveillance
for
counterintelligence
purposes.
i
would
like
to
point
first
the
preamble
of
the
constitution
which
sets
forth
the
purpose
of
this
republic.
one
of
the
primary
stated
purposes
in
the
preamble
is
to
ensure
to
domestic
tranquility.
the
insurance
of
domestic
tranquility
we
would
submit
involves
an
executive
function
as
well
as
a
legislative
and
a
judicial
function.
article
2,
section
2,
provides
and
that
reposes
the
executive
function
of
the
united
states
in
the
president
of
the
united
states.
and
article
2
also
requires
that
the
president
take
an
oath
that
he
will
do
to
the
best
of
his
ability
preserve,
protect,
and
defend
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
i
submit
in
this
regard
that
the
protection
of
the
constitution
or
the
oath
to
protect
the
constitution
is
not
an
oath
merely
to
protect
the
document
itself,
but
to
protect
the
principles
of
under
which
the
constitution
was
adopted
and
the
rights
guaranteed
by
that
constitution.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes,
sir.
i
think
i
would
hope
to
show
that
it
does.
in
article
2,
section
2
the
framers
of
the
constitution
designated
the
president
of
the
united
states
as
commander
in
chief
of
the
army,
of
the
navy,
and
of
the
militia
of
the
several
states
when
called
into
active
service
by
him.
in
article
2,
section
3,
enjoins
the
president
to
take
care
that
the
laws
of
this
nation
are
faithfully
executed.
each
of
this
we
submit
is
an
executive
function.
this
court
in
entering
nagel
and
passing
upon
article
2,
section
3
such
stated
and
i
would
like
to
quote
from
that,
“the
president’s
duty
to
take
care
that
the
laws
be
faithfully
executed
extends
not
merely
to
the
enforcement
of
specific
acts
of
congress
but
to
the
enforcement
of
the
rights,
duties,
and
obligations
growing
out
of
the
constitution
itself
are
international
relations
and
all
other
protection
implied
by
the
nature
of
our
government
under
the
constitution.”
article
4,
section
4
which
is
often
times
overlooked
carries
out
the
promise
of
the
preamble
of
the
constitution.
that
article
provides
that
the
united
states
shall
guarantee
to
every
state
of
the
united
states
a
republican
form
of
government
and
shall
protect
each
of
them
against
invasion
and
on
application
of
the
legislature
or
the
executive
when
the
legislature
is
not
in
session
against
domestic
violence.
now,
i
have
previously
alluded
to
article
1,
section
8
of
the
constitution
which
provides
that
congress
shall
provide
for
the
calling
forth
of
the
militia
to
execute
the
laws
of
the
nation,
to
suppress
insurrection
and
repel
invasion.
now
as
one
of
the
briefs
pointed
out,
this
power
is
in
congress
but
congress
has
exercised
that
power.
it
exercised
it
in
1792
in
the
second
congress.
it
provided
in
what
is
now
10
u.s.c.
331,
that
the
president
could
call
the
militia
of
the
several
states
in
the
federal
service
and
authorizes
him
to
use
such
force
as
he
deems
necessary.
and
i
--
this
is
a
quote
from
the
provision
of
the
act,
“as
he
considers
necessary
to
suppress
insurrection.”
this
is
an
executive
function
reposed
in
the
president
of
the
united
states.
332
provides
that
whenever
the
president
considers
unlawful
obstructions,
combinations
or
assemblages
or
rebellion
against
the
authority
of
the
united
states,
make
it
impracticable
to
enforce
the
laws
of
the
united
states
and
in
any
state
or
territory
by
the
ordinary
course
of
judicial
proceedings,
he
may
call
into
the
service
of
the
militia
of
any
state
and
use
such
of
the
armed
forces
as
he
considers
necessary
to
enforce
those
laws
or
to
suppress
rebellion.
section
333
of
10
u.s.c.
provides
the
president
use
the
militia
or
the
armed
forces
for
both
or
any
other
means
and
“shall
take
such
measures
as
he
considers
necessary
to
suppress
in
a
state,
domestic
violence,
unlawful
combination
or
conspiracy
that
seriously
interferes
to
the
execution
of
laws
in
the
united
states.”
we
would
submit
in
this
regard
that
article
4,
section
4
of
the
constitution
makes
no
distinction
with
respect
to
presidential
powers
as
they
pertain
to
invasion
or
domestic
violence.
now,
we
turn
to
the
omnibus
crime
control
and
safe
streets
act
of
1968.
in
that
act,
in
subsection
3
of
2511
there
is
this
language,
nor
shall
anything
contained
in
this
chapter
be
deemed
to
limit
the
constitutional
power
of
the
president
to
take
such
measures
as
he
deems
necessary
to
protect
the
united
states
against
the
overflow
by
force
or
other
unlawful
means
or
against
any
other
clear
and
present
danger
to
the
structure
or
existence
of
government.
if
there
be
any
doubt
as
to
what
any
other
means
as
the
phrase
is
used
in
that
statutory
provision,
it
is
dispel
by
the
next
following
sentence.
the
contents
of
any
wire
or
oral
communication
intercepted
by
the
authority
of
the
president
in
the
exercise
of
a
foregoing
powers
may
be
received
in
evidence
in
any
trial
or
hearing
or
other
proceeding
only
where
such
interception
was
reasonable
and
shall
not
be
otherwise
used
or
disclosed
except
as
is
necessary
to
implement
that
power.
we
suggest,
your
honors,
that
in
the
exercise
of
this
function
by
the
president
of
the
united
states
there
is
of
course
a
discretion
vested
and
whenever
the
discretion
is
vested
there
is
of
course
the
chance
that
the
discretion
will
be
abused.
but
this
is
the
very
essence
of
our
government
and
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
at
the
time
of
our
continental
congress,
at
the
time
of
the
constitutional
convention,
at
the
time
this
very
constitution
was
enacted.
there
was
serious
question
as
to
whether
or
not
this
court
had
the
power
of
judicial
review.
it
was
asserted
at
that
time
when
this
court
consisted
of
five
members
that
a
majority
of
that
court
could,
if
it
had
the
power
of
judicial
review,
substitute
its
judgment,
for
the
judgment
of
both
houses
of
congress
and
the
people
of
the
united
states
that
elected
him.
justice
marshall
answered
the
question
but
i
think
alexander
hamilton
answered
it
even
more
eloquently
in
the
federalist
paper
number
80
in
which
he
said,
“to
argue
that
the
members
of
the
court
could
substitute
there
judgment
for
the
will
of
the
people
would
argue
that
there
ought
to
be
no
court.”
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
chief
justice
marshall,
i
believe
answered
the
question
in
the
same
way.
if
we
look
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
i
doubt
if
we
can
find
one
phrase
or
one
word
which
reposes
in
the
court
the
power
of
judicial
review.
but
justice
marshall
found
that
it
was
inherit
in
the
constitution
itself
that
this
--
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
sorry.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
we
suggest
in
this
regard
that,
we
are
not
asking
for
an
exemption
of
the
fourth
amendment.
we
do
not
suggest
the
president
is
above
the
fourth
amendment.
we
simply
suggest
that
in
the
area
in
which
he
has
limited
but
the
exclusive
authority
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
may
authorize
electronic
surveillance
and
in
those
cases
it
is
reasonable.
i
would
suggest
in
this
regard
that
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
prohibit
all
searches
and
seizures.
but
only
those
which
are
deemed
--
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
i
think
that
the
abuse
of
discretion
to
which
you
will
elude
is
possible
not
only
in
the
executive
function
but
in
the
judicial
as
well
as
the
legislative.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
i
think
that
–-
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
within
the
limited
procedures,
prescribed
by
the
statute
under
which
he
acts.
now,
if
he
chooses
to
violate
that
statute,
he
might
well
choose
to
violate
his
oath.
this
is
an
attribute
of
our
government
which
exists
and
has
always
existed.
but
i
would
also
suggest
in
this
regard
that
this
is
not
an
unbridled
discretion.
we
are
here
before
this
court
for
the
court
to
examine
whether
or
not
in
this
case
there
was
an
unbridled
discretion
or
an
abused
of
that
discretion.
if
i
may,
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
reserve
what
time
i
have
left
for
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
thank
you.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
--
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
pardon
me.
if
you
need
it,
we’ll
enlarge
your
time
about
two
minutes.
perhaps
you
won’t
need
it.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
i
don’t
think
i’ll
need
it.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes,
sir.
i
should
first
like
to
allude
to
the
statement
by
mr.
justice
stewart
with
reference
to
a
constitutional
definition
of
the
warrant.
i
am
unaware
of
any
constitutional
definition
of
a
warrant
as
such.
i
think
the
constitution
speaks
of
a
warrant
this
government
has
recognized
numerous
types
of
warrants.
i
think
in
footnote
13
of
our
brief,
in
our
reply
brief.
we
indicate
and
this
was
not
intended
to
be
a
comprehensive
search,
20
instances
where
the
congress
of
the
united
states
has
provided
for
either
warrantless
searches
or
searches
conducted
under
warrants
issued
by
persons
other
than
members
of
the
federal
judiciary.
counsel
have
cited
the
case
of
abel
versus
the
united
states.
in
fact,
we
urged
the
abel
case
in
the
sixth
circuit
court
and
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
sixth
circuit
court
when
referring
to
abel
stated
that
mr.
abel
was
arrested
by
a
warrant
which
the
opinion
of
the
court
found
to
have
been
lawfully
issued
by
a
lawfully
authorized
magistrate
and
that
the
material
seized
at
the
time
of
his
arrest
were
held
legally
admissible
as
incident
to
that
arrest.
a
decision
in
that
case
was
written
by
justice
frankfurter.
the
warrant
was
not
issued
by
a
magistrate.
the
warrant
was
issued
by
an
officer
in
the
department
of
immigration
and
naturalization
service,
a
subordinate
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states.
i
would
suggest
in
this
regard
that
while
the
warrant
requirement
as
it
pertains
to
judicial
proceedings
criminal
judicial
proceedings
especially
by
enlarge
are
issued
by
members
of
the
federal
judiciary.
there
is
a
great
body
in
statute
in
this
country
which
permits
not
only
warrantless
searches
which
we've
alluded
to
in
some
of
our
briefs
but
warrants
issued
by
persons
other
than
judicial
magistrates.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
pardon
me,
it’s
in
the
main
brief
(inaudible).
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
i
may
have
put
those
wrong,
sir
and
i'm
sorry
if
i
have.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
but
i
could
recite
the
20
instances.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes,
sir.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
i
--
on
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
which
i
believe
was
the
--
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes.
there
is
--
they
are
subject
to
--
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
the
judicial
review,
i
would
say
based
upon
the
warrant
requirement
in
each
case.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
well,
in
this
regard
i
was
interested
in
the
statement
by
mr.
gossett
in
which
he
says
that
he
is
in
dark
as
to
the
contents
of
the
in
camera
exhibit.
mr.
gossett
represents
the
respondent
court
and
the
respondent
court
certainly
had
in
its
possession
and
that
in
camera
exhibit
shouldn’t
have
been
available
if
it
wasn’t
to
the
attorney
for
the
respondent
court
as
distinguished
in
the
respondent
-
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
we
have
in
the
past
and
i
think
before
this
court
not
too
recently
submitted
to
this
court
in
camera
and
to
the
attorneys
for
the
parties
in
that
case
it
was
not
a
federal
district
judge
but
the
defendants
in
the
case
itself.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
no.
we
never
told
him
he
couldn’t.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
i
would
assume
that
at
the
time
this
matter
came
before
this
circuit
court
at
least
and
before
this
court,
when
mr.
gossett
became
counsel
of
record
had
to
--
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes,
sir.
he
may
see
it.
yes,
sir
mr.
justice
he
may
see
it
now.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
the
contents
i
presume
are
known
to
or
should
be
known
to
justice,
i
mean,
judge
keith
and
we
have
no
objection
to
mr.
gossett’s
viewing
the
in
camera
exhibits.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
mr.
gossett
who
represents
the
respondent
court
is
certainly
--
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
well,
there
only
--
there's
only
one
person
involve
contrary
with
counsel
statement.
the
only
overhearing
that
we
have
is
the
overhearing
of
the
defendant
plamondon.
the
other
two
are
here
before
this
court
only
because
--
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
plamondon,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
no.
the
government’s
positions
which
initiated
--
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
well,
we
would
not
having
adversary
proceeding
in
any
instance
where
the
overhearing
involved
matters
relating
to
the
national
security.
if
there
is
a
distinction
between
overhearings
in
so
called
foreign
intelligence
cases
as
distinguished
from
national
security
cases,
i
have
been
unable
as
objectively
as
i
can
to
do
distinguish
between
so
called
domestic
and
foreign
intelligence.
now,
counsel
brought
up
the
fact
that
in
one
of
our
footnotes
we
referred
to
some
documents
which
we
submitted
to
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeal
on
our
motion
to
augment
the
record.
that
case
came
up
--
was
tried
before
the
keith
case.
that
--
that’s
the
ferguson
or
smith
case.
in
mr.
--
judge
keith’s
opinion,
he
refers
in
extensile
to
the
opinion
of
just
--
judge
ferguson.
in
the
way
matter
arose
was
this,
in
the
smith
case
which
is
still
pending
before
this
court,
i
understand.
we
made
an
in
camera
submission
to
the
court
and
i
believe
that
in
camera
submission
consisted
a
one
sheet
of
paper
which
again
was
an
incidental
overhearing
of
the
defendant
smith.
we
urge
in
that
case
that
it
was
national
security
intelligence
tap
and
i
think
the
record
will
disclose
that
it's
the
same
tapped
that
is
before
this
court.
in
that
case,
we
urge
that
the
information
contained
in
the
log
should
not
be
disclosed
and
its
disclosure
would
not
be
in
the
interest
and
would
be
prejudicial
to
the
national
security.
we
did
not
argue
in
that
case
nor
was
the
question
raised
by
the
court
or
by
the
defendant
that
that
case
involved
a
domestic
intelligence
case.
yet,
in
the
determination
of
the
court
in
the
ninth
circuit
case,
judge
ferguson,
he
held
that
the
government
was
required
to
disclose
again
as
a
prelude
to
attain
hearing.
the
overhearing
on
the
grounds
that
and
he
used
the
term
13
separate
times,
purely
domestic
or
wholly
domestic
organization
or
purely
domestic
or
wholly
domestic
intelligence.
and
yet
the
only
basis
for
the
fact
determination
was
the
in
camera
submission
of
one
sheet
of
paper
which
indicated
the
overhearing
of
the
defendant’s
smith’s
voice.
for
that
reason
when
the
matter
went
before
the
ninth
circuit,
the
government
sought
to
augment
the
record
and
to
let
the
court
view
all
of
the
overhearings
of
the
surveillance
in
question
to
determine
whether
it
was
in
fact
wholly
domestic
or
purely
domestic
or
whether
it
was
a
wholly
domestic
or
purely
domestic
organization.
an
examination
of
the
logs
will
disclose
that
it’s
not
wholly
domestic
or
purely
domestic.
its
foreign
ties
exceeded
its
domestic
ties
and
it
was
for
that
reason
that
we
made
that
offer
to
the
court
in
the
ninth
circuit.
and
we
would
make
that
offer
to
this
court,
if
the
court
would
like
to
view
the
record
which
we
submitted
in
that
case.
now,
with
reference
to
why
we
footnoted
the
reference
to
the
smith
case,
that
footnote,
that
brief
was
drawn
at
the
time
that
judge
ferguson
sought
a
petition
in
this
court
for
certiorari
before
the
determination
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
we
acquiesce
in
that
petition
and
sought
to
have
this
court,
hear
both
cases
together
so
that
this
court
could
view
the
in
camera
submission
which
was
made
at
the
circuit
court
level
stage.
i
take
and
i
must
take
some
exception
to
the
characterization
of
this
case
as
an
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
engage
in
electronics
surveillance
for
the
purpose
of
observing
the
activities
of
decedent
political
groups.
the
statute
under
which
this
government
is
operating
certainly
prohibits
that.
i
would
also
point
out
that
this
whole
question
of
electronic
surveillance
in
what
is
disclosed.
this
court
must
is
a
coordinate
branch
of
government
rely
almost
entirely
on
the
integrity
of
the
executive
branch.
the
executive
branch,
it
was
the
executive
branch
through
the
then
solicitor
general
who
now
sits
on
this
court,
who
made
the
disclosure
to
this
court.
and
in
each
instance,
where
a
motion
is
made
under
rule
16,
it
is
the
integrity
of
the
government
that
has
to
be
relied
upon
unless
this
court
is
going
to
fashion
a
rule
which
would
permit
every
defendant
to
rummage
all
of
the
files
of
all
the
investigative
agencies
of
government.
now
administratively,
we
suggest
this
cannot
work.
administratively,
it
would
break
down
the
separation
of
powers
that
exist
between
government
and
would
also
break
down
the
entire
law
enforcement
function
of
government.
where
do
we
go
less
than
that?
when
the
motion
is
made,
the
government
responds.
if
the
government
is
not
to
be
trusted
to
respond
with
respect
to
a
motion
under
rule
16,
then
it
should
be
expected.
i
assume
from
what
counsel
said
to
respond
honestly
with
respect
to
the
nature
of
its
activities.
now
certainly,
this
neither
president
or
any
prior
president
to
my
knowledge
is
authorized
electronic
surveillance
to
monitor
the
activities
of
an
opposite
political
group.
the
only
purpose
is
--
as
i
have
stated;
one,
to
obtain
the
on
going
intelligence
necessary
to
compete
in
the
area
of
foreign
affairs
and
the
on-going
intelligence
necessary
for
this
nation
to
protect
itself
against
not
only
as
foreign
foes
but
its
domestic
foes.
now,
counsel
gossett
has
suggested
that
we
might
in
this
area
you
use
the
provisions
relating
to
cases
involving
sabotage
or
espionage.
i
would
submit
that
if
it
were
a
sabotage
case
or
an
espionage
case,
we
certainly
should
invoke
the
provisions
of
the
statute.
but
when
we’re
talking
about
the
on
going
intelligence
function
of
government,
there
is
no
probable
cause
in
many
cases
as
that
term
is
used
in
the
criminal
prosecuted
sense.
now,
i
do
not
know
that
it’s
an
appropriate
analogy
but
certainly
the
protection
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
against
assassination
is
one
aspect
to
the
nation’s
national
security.
heads
of
state
have
been
assassinated
to
bring
down
governments.
a
simply
--
simple
cursory
examination
of
the
warren
commission
report
will
find,
will
disclose
numerous
instances
by
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
and
the
secret
service
were
criticized
for
not
having
the
on
going
intelligence
necessary
to
provide
adequate
protection
to
the
president.
i
suggest
again
with
respect
to
the
provisions
of
article
4,
section
4
of
the
constitution
which
the
congress
has
--
execution
of
which
the
congress
is
placed
in
the
president.
there
is
no
distinction
in
the
constitutional
article
or
in
the
statutes
passed
pursuant
thereto
with
respect
to
the
presidential
authority
as
its
relates
to
invasion
or
civil
insurrection.
both
require
on
going
intelligence
because
without
that
intelligence,
the
president
cannot
make
an
appropriate
decision.
as
the
court
held
in
the
kennedy
case,
constitution
isn’t
a
suicide
act.
the
president
can’t
wait
until
the
moment
of
invasion
or
insurrection
to
start
putting
together
a
counterintelligence
function.
the
president
must
have
this
information
if
he’s
to
carry
out
his
responsibilities
under
the
constitution.
to
defend
this
nation
against
invasion
or
domestic
violence
and
we
submit
that
the
record
of
the
past
six
presidents
and
the
past
12
attorneys
general
is
deserving
of
the
high
esteem
of
this
court,
is
deserving
of
permitting
the
chief
executive
to
carry
out
his
functions
under
the
constitution
and
within
the
constraints
of
the
fourth
amendment
as
i
have
attempted
to
define
them
here.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
this
was
before
the
petition
for
writ
of
mandamus
was
filed
and
before
judge
keith
was
represented
by
mr.
gossett.
as
we
have
in
all
cases
to
my
knowledge
and
as
we
did
before
this
court
in
the
times
in
the
post
case.
we
permitted
an
examination
not
by
a
member
in
a
case
where
a
judge
wasn’t
involved
but
by
not
one
but
several
four
members
or
so.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
i
think
if
there
is
an
--
if
there
is
a
misunderstanding
in
this
case,
it
was
not
on
the
part
of
the
government,
had
the
request
been
made
most
assuredly.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
i
had
assumed
that
he
had
seen
it.
i
had
assumed
it.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
no,
sir.
if
mr.
gossett
says
he
hasn’t
seen
it,
he
hasn’t
seen
it.
but
had
mr.
gossett
requested
the
opportunity
to
see
the
in
camera
exhibit,
mr.
gossett
replication
is
such
that
who
would
be
no
question
if
the
government
acquiesce
on
that
demand.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
i
recently
responded
to
a
letter
from
senator
kennedy
of
massachusetts
and
i
set
forth
the
actual
figures
that
the
department
of
justice
had
with
respect
to
electronics
surveillance,
the
director
of
the
fbi,
mr.
hoover
testifies
annually
during
his
budget
hearings
and
will
be
testifying
within
the
next
week
into
as
to
the
extent
of
electronic
surveillance.
i
can
say
without
qualification
rather
than
it
is
being
increased
that
there
has
been
a
substantial
decreased
in
the
amount
of
electronic
surveillance
in
the
area
in
which
we
are
speaking.
that
is
a
matter
within
the
knowledge
of
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
and
when
requested
we
have
disclosed
on
some
occasions
of
the
--
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
we
consider
this
matter
as
did
the
committee
of
the
privy
council
of
england
as
to
how
often
you
should
distribute
the
figures.
certainly,
if
the
figures
are
disclosed
on
an
on
going
basis
of
information
relative
to
the
intelligence
function
of
government
can
be
gleaned.
but
we
did
on
that
occasion
in
response
to
senator
kennedy
give
him
the
figures
that
indicated
the
total
number
of
surveillances
for
the
entire
year,
the
maximum
number
at
each
time.
you
get
into
this
numbers
game
mr.
justice
and
you
get
--
you
have
problems
because
we,
in
our
brief
in
the
ninth
--
in
the
sixth
circuit
and
the
ninth
circuit
as
well,
indicated
the
figures,
the
testimony
of
the
director
of
the
fbi
before
congress
over
the
past
ten
years
and
those
figures
were
as
of
the
day
he
testify.
the
figures
i
gave
senator
kennedy
were
the
actual
figures
which
we
have
in
the
department
of
justice
and
included
not
one
a
particular
day
which
happened
to
coincide
with
director
hoover’s
testimony
but
the
maximum
number
on
any
day
and
the
total
number
for
the
entire
year
both
as
to
telephones
and
microphones.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes,
sir,
that
--
those
are
the
figures
testified
to
by
the
director
and
the
only
purpose
was
to
show
the
decreased.
we
were
not
intending
to
indicate
anything
other
than
the
fact
that
they
had
decreased
over
the
years.
i
believe
in
one
of
--
i
believe
there
has
been
references
as
justice
douglas
said
to
a
letter
from
senator
kennedy,
the
letter
was
to
me,
i
believe,
senator
and
i
responded.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
i
said
i
would
supply
them.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arises
from
a
criminal
proceeding
which
is
now
pending
in
the
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
michigan,
in
which
the
three
defendants
were
charge
with
a
conspiracy
to
destroy
government
property.
one
of
the
defendants,
the
defendant
plamondon
was
also
charged
the
substant
violation
of
destroying
government
property.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes,
sir.
the
indictments
in
this
case
resulted
from
the
dynamite
bombing
of
the
offices
of
the
central
intelligence
agency
building
in
ann
arbor,
michigan.
during
the
course
of
the
pretrial
proceedings,
motion
was
made
for
discovery
of
information
relating
to
electronic
surveillance
that
might
be
in
possession
of
the
government.
in
response
to
this
motion,
the
government
served
upon
the
movements
an
affidavit
of
the
attorney
general
of
united
states,
in
which
he
acknowledged
that
one
to
the
defendants,
the
defendant
plamondon,
had
been
overheard
in
the
course
of
a
surveillance
authorized
by
him
in
which
he
deemed
necessary
in
the
interest
of
the
national
security
united
states.
the
affidavits
stated
that
the
disclosure
of
this
information
would
be
prejudicial
to
the
interest
of
united
states.
in
addition
to
serving
the
affidavit
on
the
movements
and
filing
it
with
the
court,
the
government
also
submitted
to
the
court
for
its
in
camera
inspection,
the
logs
of
the
over
hearings
requested
by
the
defendants,
included
in
that
in
that
in
camera
submission,
the
government
also
offered
the
of
--
the
proof
of
the
authorization
to
the
attorney
general
of
united
states
for
the
surveillance
and
question
conducted
prior
to
the
time
of
the
bombing.
the
in
camera
exhibit
will
show,
which
is
now
before
this
court,
that
it
contains
a
memorandum
from
the
director
of
the
fbi
to
the
attorney
general,
in
which
he
sets
forth
all
of
the
electric
--
electronic
surveillances
operated
by
the
government
at
that
time,
approved
by
the
attorney
general
or
by
the
former
attorney
general.
prior
to
submission
however,
the
government
excised
the
names
of
the
organizations
and
individuals
which
were
the
subject
of
surveillance
with
the
exception
of
the
organization
which
this
--
which
was
the
subject
of
surveillance
in
this
case.
that
in
camera
submission
will
also
show,
a
characterization
in
the
form
of
the
memorandum
from
the
director
of
the
fbi
to
the
attorney
general,
the
organization
in
question,
its
leadership
and
its
illegal
aims
and
information
relating
to
the
fact
that
the
organization
was
engaged
in
activities
of
a
type
which
would
ultimately
lead
to
the
destruction
for
the
united
states
government
before
some
violence.
this
in
camera
submission
would
also
show
that
the
authorization
of
the
attorney
general
was
for
a
limited
period
only.
it
described
the
premises
where
the
installation
surveillance
was
involved
and
indicated
that
the
surveillance
was
subject
to
periodic
review.
based
upon
this
in
camera
submission,
the
united
states
urged
that
the
surveillance
and
question
was
lawful.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
pardon
me,
sir,
i
didn’t
--
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
government
urged
that
this
was
a
lawful
surveillance
exercised
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
president
united
states
and
--
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes,
your
honor.
the
government’s
position
based
upon
this
in
camera
submission
and
the
affidavit
of
the
attorney
general
was
at
the
surveillance.
it
was
a
lawful
as
reasonable
exercise
of
the
presidential
powers
in
the
area
of
national
security.
the
district
court
after
reviewing
the
in
camera
submission
and
i
should
point
out
in
this
regard,
that
the
in
camera
submission
was
not
intended
as
a
justification
for
the
authorization
but
simply
of
proof
of
the
fact
that
the
authorization
had
been
granted
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
over
his
own
signature.
the
respondent
court,
judge
keith,
held
based
upon
the
affidavit
and
the
in
camera
submission
that
the
overhearing
should
be
disclosed
to
the
defendants
as
a
plaintiff
to
an
evidentiary
hearing
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
information
contained
on
the
logs
contributed
in
any
ways
to
the
prosecution
of
the
defendant
plamondon.
it
took
--
made
this
holding
on
the
basis
that
the
president
of
united
states
was
without
authority
to
authorize
a
surveillance
absent
--
the
judicial
in
a
position
of
a
warrant
by
sitting
a
federal
judge.
the
united
states
immediately
petitioned
for
a
writ
of
mandamus
to
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
the
sixth
circuit
unanimously
held
that
mandamus
was
an
appropriate
remedy
but
by
a
divided
court
concurred
in
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
on
the
basis,
in
the
words
of
justice
edwards,
that
there
was
not
one
phrase
or
word
in
the
constitution
in
the
united
states,
in
the
statutory
law
of
united
states
or
the
case
law
of
the
united
states
that
exempted
the
president
of
united
states
from
the
provisions
of
the
fourth
amendment.
we
do
not
contend
here,
your
honors
that
the
president
of
the
united
states
either
individually
or
acting
through
the
attorney
general
is
exempt
from
the
provisions
of
the
fourth
amendment
or
is
above
the
provisions
of
the
constitution.
we
do
suggest
that
this
case
puts
into
issue
an
intelligence
function
and
procedure
which
has
been
sanctioned
by
six
successive
presidents
acting
through
12
successive
attorneys
general.
and
while
the
constitutional
issue
is
grave
and
the
stakes
as
far
as
the
government
are
concerned
is
high,
the
issue
before
the
court
can
be
easily
framed.
stated
negatively,
the
question
is
not
whether
electronic
surveillance
is
a
permissible
governmental
tool.
more
narrowly
claimed,
the
question
is
whether
in
a
limited
area
of
counterintelligence
activities,
the
president
of
the
united
states
may
authorize
electronic
surveillance
in
the
absence
of
a
warrant
by
a
member
of
the
judiciary
of
this
nation.
in
order
to
understand
the
case
and
to
properly
resolve
it,
i
think
we
must
first
understand
the
factual
setting
as
distinguished
from
the
other
cases
that
have
been
before
this
court.
this
is
not
a
case
such
as
the
katz
case
or
the
black
case
or
o’brian
or
alderman,
where
electronic
surveillance
was
authorized
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
prosecutive
evidence
in
a
criminal
proceeding.
nor
is
it
a
case
as
in
those
cases
where
the
defendant
was
the
target
of
the
electronic
surveillance
which
was
authorized.
we
have
here
as
we
had
in
the
clay
case,
a
situation
where
one
of
the
defendants
unfortuitously
or
fortuitously
depending
upon
the
outcome
of
this
case
happen
to
dial
a
number
which
was
the
subject
of
a
surveillance
authorized
by
the
president
of
the
united
states
acting
through
the
attorney
general.
the
government
contends
contrary
to
the
distinction
made
by
the
lower
court,
that
the
president
of
the
united
states
is
imbued
with
two
powers
in
order
to
carry
out
two
responsibilities.
both
lower
courts
distinguished
the
clay
case
on
the
grounds
that
the
power
exercised
in
that
case
was
an
aid
of
the
powers
of
the
president
in
the
area
of
foreign
affairs
related
that
power
to
defending
the
interest
of
the
united
states
against
the
acts
of
hostile
foreign
powers.
united
states
urges
that
they
--
these
two
powers
are
separate
and
distinct.
the
one
power
or
the
power
of
the
president
in
the
area
of
foreign
affairs
is
granted
upon
the
fact
that
the
president
is
the
exclusive
national
organ
of
the
united
states
in
the
area
of
foreign
affairs.
the
other
power
is
granted
upon
the
responsibility
and
obligation
of
the
president
to
protect
the
security
of
the
united
states
against
its
enemies
whether
foreign
or
domestic.
because
counterintelligence
activities
often
involved
both
powers,
there’s
some
confusion
has
come
to
exist.
in
counterintelligence
activities
involved
in
the
area
of
foreign
affairs.
the
purpose
is
to
--
purpose
of
the
surveillance
is
to
permit
the
president
of
united
states
to
obtain
the
ongoing
intelligence
information
which
is
necessary
to
him
to
compete
on
at
least
an
equal
footing
with
the
information
obtained
by
foreign
powers
with
whom
he
has
to
deal.
in
the
area
of
national
security
however,
the
intelligence
that
is
sought
is
for
an
entirely
different
purpose
and
the
power
and
responsibility
are
grounded
upon
the
president’s
function
in
protecting
the
national
security
against
the
enemies
of
the
united
states
whether
foreign
or
domestic.
out
of
this
confusion
in
dichotomy,
the
cases
have
discussed
both
powers
as
if
they
were
one,
and
i
think
these
case
points
up
most
eloquently
the
confusion
which
has
existed
between
foreign
and
domestic
intelligence.
the
government
contends
that
as
a
legal
and
as
a
practical
matter
you
cannot
distinguish
between
foreign
and
domestic
intelligence
unless
you
use
the
situs
of
the
installation
as
a
basis
for
making
a
distinction.
both
lower
courts
however
were
not
confused
with
this
problem.
they
did
not
reach
it.
the
respondent
court
grounded
its
decision
on
the
basis
that
the
intelligence
function
exercised
here
was
for
the
purpose
of
surveiling
a
domestic
organization
and
failed
to
distinguish
the
difference
between
surveiling
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
intelligence
information
as
distinguished
from
the
nature
of
the
organization
from
which
the
intelligence
was
sought.
we
suggest
also
that
the
constitutional
authority
of
the
president
is
not
found
in
any
one
provision
or
any
one
article
but
may
be
gleaned
from
the
constitution
as
a
whole
and
i
speak
now
only
for
the
constitutional
authority
of
the
president
in
the
area
of
national
security
affairs.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
the
congress
has
undoubted
authority
in
the
area
of
national
security,
i
think
you,
as
pointed
out
in
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
national
lawyers
guild
and
the
black
panther
party
in
article
1
section
15.
the
constitution
provides
the
states
that
the
congress
shall
provide
for
the
calling
of
the
militia
of
the
united
states
in
the
event
of
insurrection.
the
amicus
brief
asserts
that
because
of
this
provision,
the
congress
of
the
united
states
as
distinguished
from
the
president
is
--
has
fair
amount
authority
in
the
area
of
the
internal
affairs
of
the
country.
i
would
point
out
in
that
regard
that
the
second
congress
confederates
of
the
provision
of
article
1
section
15,
did
provide
for
the
calling
of
the
militia
and
repose
that
responsibility
in
the
president
of
the
united
states,
post
statutes
enacted
it
the
second
congress
now
subsist
in
10
u.s.c.
1031
and
1032.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
i
would
agree,
your
honor.
in
fact
i
think
in
this
area
as
the
court
--
this
court
pointed
out
in
colonnade
catering,
the
congress
the
united
states
has
broad
powers.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes,
in
fashioning
a
rule
of
reasonableness
under
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
i
think
this
type
of
activity
your
honor
is
peculiarly
within
the
executive
function.
i
would
like
--
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
i
would
not
wish
to
state
at
this
argument,
your
honor.
that
it
is
within
the
exclusive
province
of
the
president
of
united
states
but
only
that
this
type
of
activity
is
peculiarly
within
the
executive
function
which
i
would
hope
to
show.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
that
issue
is
not
before
this
court
and
--
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
i
think
under
the
rule
announced
by
this
court
in
colonnade
catering
that
within
certain
limits,
the
congress
could
severely
restrict
the
power
of
the
president
in
this
area.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
i
think
that
congress
has
already
provided
the
--
that
in
the
--
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes,
i
would
concur
on
that,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
as
i
try
to
suggest
the
affidavit,
it
was
never
intended
as
the
basis
for
justifying
the
surveillance
in
question.
the
affidavit
--
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
the
affidavit
was
filed
with
the
movements.
the
justification
and
again
i
suggest
it
--
is
only
a
partial
justification
as
contained
in
the
in
camera
exhibit
which
was
submitted
to
judge
keith.
i
think
where
the
attorney
general
to
set
forth
any
--
everything
that
--
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
no,
sir.
and
we
do
not
rely
upon
the
affidavit
itself
with
the
in
camera
exhibit.
i
think
the
in
camera
will
show
in
the
characterization
of
the
organization
involved
which
was
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
at
the
time
the
director
of
the
fbi
sought
authority
from
him
to
engage
in
the
surveillance
that
the
organization
involved
was
in
--
then
engaged
--
enacts
activities
which
they
hope
would
ultimately
result
in
the
destruction
of
our
form
of
government
by
means
of
illegal
force.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes
sir.[lunch
recess]
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
noon
recess,
i
prepared
to
continue
my
response
to
mr.
justice
white
and
i
would
like
to
finish
the
answer
to
my
question
if
i
may
and
with
respect
to
the
in
camera
submission,
your
honor.
the
in
camera
submission
to
the
court
was
intended
for
the
purpose
of
satisfying
the
court
as
to
the
authorization
of
the
attorney
general
of
united
states
in
the
finding
of
the
attorney
general.
i
would
like
to
point
out
in
this
regard
--
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes,
that
the
in
camera
document
which
the
attorney
general
signed
which
contained
the
authorization
from
the
surveillance
in
question.
i
should
like
to
point
out
that
the
--
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes.
in
the
procedures
then
followed
which
if
you
recall
this
case
arose
out
of
a
bombing
that
occurred
in
september
1968
and
the
indictment
return
in
1969.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
i
would
concur
in
that,
your
honor.
i
think
you
will
find
that
the
authorization
which
requested
contained
that
information
and
was
approved
and
signed
by
the
attorney
general
of
united
states.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
i
think
that
is
satisfied
by
the
signature
of
the
attorney
general
approving
the
authorization
based
upon
the
evidence
which
is
contained
in
the
request
of
authorization.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
the
requested
authorization
states
that
it’s
requested
because
it
does
pose
a
clear
and
present
danger
to
destruction
existence
of
government
and
the
attorney
general
approved
that
statement.
procedures
now
in
existence
are
different
and
would
contain
an
expressed
finding
to
that
effect
directed
to
the
director
of
the
fbi.
i
would
like
to
point

--
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
no,
i
would
say
that
it
would
be
conclusionary,
your
honor
more
than
setting
forth
each
specific
fact.
we
keep
in
mind
the
decision-making
process
in
this
area
is
based
upon
the
entire
spectrum
of
intelligence
information
available
to
the
attorney
general
and
not
only
the
information
supplied
in
by
the
director
of
the
fbi.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
limited
judicial
review
i
would
say,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
in
this
area,
i
think
the
review
should
--
is
limited
to
a
determination
of
whether
or
not
there
was
a
gross
abuse
of
discretion
by
the
attorney
general
acting
for
the
president
and
making
the
authorization.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
well
--
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
i
would
say,
your
honor
that
this
goes
right
to
the
heart
of
a
matter.
in
this
area,
certain
of
the
information
which
is
available,
all
of
the
information
which
is
available
to
the
attorney
general
of
united
states
and
through
him
to
the
president
is
not
available
to
each
investigative
agency
of
government.
there
is
an
entire
spec
--
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
all
of
that
information
is
not
made
available
to
the
courts.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
we
suggest
that
in
the
limited
area
of
counterintelligence
activities
of
government
as
distinguished
from
the
situation
where
a
warrant
is
sought
for
prosecutive
purposes.
that
the
executive
function
in
this
area
is
somewhat
limited
and
that
where
the
president
of
united
states
acting
through
the
attorney
general
or
the
attorney
general
himself
or
one
of
his
subordinates
to
lay
before
a
sitting
federal
judge
of
the
entire
spectrum
of
information
consisting
of
teletypes,
letterhead
memorandum
and
all
of
the
information
that
comes
from
not
only
the
fbi
but
from
other
agencies
such
as
the
central
intelligence
agency,
the
national
security
agency,
the
alcohol-tobacco
and
firearms
division
of
the
department
of
treasury,
and
other
investigative
agencies
of
the
government.
all
of
these
are
reposed,
all
this
information
is
reposed
and
files
in
the
attorney
general
of
united
states
before
he
makes
the
authorization
or
grants
the
authorization
requested,
and
i
would
point
--
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
i
think
as
we
attempt
to
show
in
our
brief
the
function
of
the
courts
--
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes,
sir.
the
function
of
the
federal
judge
in
criminal
cases
is
twofold.
one,
the
judge
must
determine
the
need
for
the
evidence
sought.
he
then
must
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
crime
has
been
committed
or
is
about
to
be
committed
before
he
authorizes
the
warrant.
now,
the
first
of
this
decisions
is
to
whether
the
information
is
needed
such
as
in
the
area
of
national
security,
counterintelligence
information,
if
you
please.
it
is
the
government’s
position
that
the
magistrate,
the
sitting
federal
judge
is
not
in
a
position
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
information
is
needed
much
less
appreciate
in
many
cases
the
importance
of
the
information
sought
unless
that
is
to
be
exposed
to
that
judge
along
with
any
one
of
over
600
federal
sitting
judges,
all
of
the
information
available
to
the
executive
in
the
area
of
national
security.
in
this
connection,
justice
--
rather
professor
telford
taylor
addressed
himself
to
the
problem
in
connection
not
with
national
security
intelligence,
counterintelligence
if
you
please,
but
with
respect
to
the
authority
of
the
judge
and
the
ability
of
the
judge
to
issue
a
warrant
in
an
ordinary
criminal
case.
and
if
i
may,
i’d
like
to
quote
from
professor
telford
taylor
and
not
that
i
ascribe
him
with
his
views
with
respect
to
warrants
issued
in
criminal
cases
but
he
says,
“what
proper
business
is
it
of
a
judge
and
what
experience
of
facilities
does
he
have
that
will
enable
him
to
decide
whether
or
not
surveillance
of
a
particular
type
is
warranted
in
a
particular
case.”
he
is
pointing
out
i
think
the
same
thing
that
was
pointed
out
in
the
report
of
the
committee
of
privy
councilors
when
they
addressed
themselves
to
this
question
in
england.
the
question
there
was,
whether
or
not
the
par
at
issue
warrants
for
electronics
surveillance
should
remain
in
the
secretary
of
state
or
should
be
reposed
in
the
federal
judiciary?
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
no,
but
i
think
the
privy
council
report
is
acutely
aware
of
the
right
of
privacy
as
it
exist
in
england
as
much
as
it
exist
in
the
united
states
and
it
addresses
itself
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
granting
of
this
authority
counterintelligence
cases
is
in
the
best
interest
of
the
right
of
privacy
of
the
individual
and
it
concludes
that
it
is
not.
it
concludes
in
its
report,
there
will
be
a
weakening
of
the
process.
that
there
will
be
a
diffusion
of
authority
to
anyone
of
the
federal
judiciary
or
the
judges
in
england
rather
than
reposing
that
responsibility
in
one
man
and
one
man
alone
and
we
would
suggest
that
the
interest
of
privacy
of
the
american
citizen
is
better
protected
in
limiting
this
authority
in
the
area
of
electronic
surveillance
and
counterintelligence
cases
to
one
man.
the
attorney
general
acting
for
the
president
of
the
united
states
rather
to
proliferate
it
amongst
all
of
the
federal
sitting
judges
in
united
states
and
we
say
that
not
in
connection
with
those
cases
where
the
judicial
process
is
one
of
the
determining
probable
cause.
but
only
in
those
cases
and
in
the
limited
area
of
counterintelligence
where
the
decision-making
process
requires
a
judgment
as
to
the
need
for
the
intelligence
information
sought
and
we
would
suggests
in
this
regard
also
that
information
obtained
by
the
government
for
counterintelligence
purposes
in
this
area
is
not
used
for
prosecutive
purposes
and
is
not
sought
for
prosecutive
purposes.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
i
believe
that
is
there
contention
but
i
think
that
in
camera
exhibit
will
show
beyond
question.
that
the
authorization
in
the
case
was
totally
unrelated
in
the
information
obtained
was
totally
unrelated
to
the
crime
for
which
this
defendants
where
indicted.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes,
sir.
i
think
in
camera
examination
will
disclose
as
the
fifth
circuit
found
in
the
clay
case
that
the
information
and
detained
in
the
logs
could
not
in
any
ways
of
a
--
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
the
burden
of
the
court
however
in
both
cases
is
the
same.
we
do
not
have
as
we
had
in
alderman
as
was
described
by
counsel
in
that
case,
case
loads
of
electronically
monitored
conversations
which
would
require
--
which
the
court
would
have
to
examine
in
juxtaposition
to
the
skeletal
averments
of
a
criminal
indictment.
we
have
as
the
counsel
in
the
alderman
case
suggested
not
even
sheaves
of
papers,
something
less
than
sheaves
of
paper.
not
unlike
jenks
act
materials,
not
unlike
grand
jury
minutes
which
this
court
as
could
the
circuit
court
and
the
district
court
have
examined
to
determine
that
the
overhearings
were
totally
unrelated
to
the
crime
for
which
these
people
where
indicted
and
i
think
that
beyond
question
in
camera
exhibit
will
show
that
the
purpose
of
the
surveillance
was
for
the
sole
and
limited
purpose
of
obtaining
counterintelligence
information
as
distinguished
from
prosecuted
evidence
in
a
criminal
case.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
i
think
it
would
apply
equally.
yes,
sir
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
i
think
in
the
–-
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
i
think
that
in
the
setting
of
this
case
the
burden
would
be
no
greater
than
the
burden
of
the
court,
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
clay
case.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
i
don’t
see
it
as
inconsistent
with
alderman.
i
think
the
facts
in
the
alderman
case
were
far
different
from
the
facts
of
this
case.
in
the
alderman
case,
as
counsel
pointed
out,
the
surveillance
was
authorized
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
prosecuted
evidence
to
be
used
in
the
criminal
case
and
it
was
directed
against
the
defendant.
and
as
in
that
case,
i
would
assume,
i
didn’t
look
at
the
record
that
there
were
literally
box
loads
of
electrically
monitored
telephone
conversations.
in
this
case,
we
have
a
situation
as
in
clay
where
as
i
have
said,
the
defendant
unfortuitously
or
fortuitously
depending
on
the
outcome
of
this
case
happened
to
call
the
wrong
number.
and
i
think
the
in
camera
examination
would
disclosed
that
fact.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
i
would
--
i
hope
to
get
to
that
and
i
would
concur
that
it
doesn’t.
i
would
like
if
i
made
a
turn
briefly
to
answer
the
assertion
of
lack
of
constitutional
authority
and
i
think
in
this
regard
we
must
recognized
the
constitution
authority
of
the
president
must
be
gleamed
for
a
reading
of
the
entire
constitution
itself.
and
i
should
like
if
i
may
to
address
myself
very
briefly
to
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
which
the
government
deems
applicable
to
this
case.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes,
sir.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
in
the
setting
of
this
case
i
would
rather
argue,
mr.
justice,
that
we
read
the
constitution
along
with
the
statutory
provision
and
that
in
itself
would
be
sufficient
for
the
presidential
authority
in
this
area.
i
think
absent
--
the
constitutional
enabling
act
or
the
congressional
enabling
act
that
we
would
have
a
more
difficult
case
but
i
think
in
that
case
as
i
hope
to
show
the
president
would
have
to
the
constitutional
authority
in
this
limited
area
to
engage
in
electronic
surveillance
for
counterintelligence
purposes.
i
would
like
to
point
first
the
preamble
of
the
constitution
which
sets
forth
the
purpose
of
this
republic.
one
of
the
primary
stated
purposes
in
the
preamble
is
to
ensure
to
domestic
tranquility.
the
insurance
of
domestic
tranquility
we
would
submit
involves
an
executive
function
as
well
as
a
legislative
and
a
judicial
function.
article
2,
section
2,
provides
and
that
reposes
the
executive
function
of
the
united
states
in
the
president
of
the
united
states.
and
article
2
also
requires
that
the
president
take
an
oath
that
he
will
do
to
the
best
of
his
ability
preserve,
protect,
and
defend
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
i
submit
in
this
regard
that
the
protection
of
the
constitution
or
the
oath
to
protect
the
constitution
is
not
an
oath
merely
to
protect
the
document
itself,
but
to
protect
the
principles
of
under
which
the
constitution
was
adopted
and
the
rights
guaranteed
by
that
constitution.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes,
sir.
i
think
i
would
hope
to
show
that
it
does.
in
article
2,
section
2
the
framers
of
the
constitution
designated
the
president
of
the
united
states
as
commander
in
chief
of
the
army,
of
the
navy,
and
of
the
militia
of
the
several
states
when
called
into
active
service
by
him.
in
article
2,
section
3,
enjoins
the
president
to
take
care
that
the
laws
of
this
nation
are
faithfully
executed.
each
of
this
we
submit
is
an
executive
function.
this
court
in
entering
nagel
and
passing
upon
article
2,
section
3
such
stated
and
i
would
like
to
quote
from
that,
“the
president’s
duty
to
take
care
that
the
laws
be
faithfully
executed
extends
not
merely
to
the
enforcement
of
specific
acts
of
congress
but
to
the
enforcement
of
the
rights,
duties,
and
obligations
growing
out
of
the
constitution
itself
are
international
relations
and
all
other
protection
implied
by
the
nature
of
our
government
under
the
constitution.”
article
4,
section
4
which
is
often
times
overlooked
carries
out
the
promise
of
the
preamble
of
the
constitution.
that
article
provides
that
the
united
states
shall
guarantee
to
every
state
of
the
united
states
a
republican
form
of
government
and
shall
protect
each
of
them
against
invasion
and
on
application
of
the
legislature
or
the
executive
when
the
legislature
is
not
in
session
against
domestic
violence.
now,
i
have
previously
alluded
to
article
1,
section
8
of
the
constitution
which
provides
that
congress
shall
provide
for
the
calling
forth
of
the
militia
to
execute
the
laws
of
the
nation,
to
suppress
insurrection
and
repel
invasion.
now
as
one
of
the
briefs
pointed
out,
this
power
is
in
congress
but
congress
has
exercised
that
power.
it
exercised
it
in
1792
in
the
second
congress.
it
provided
in
what
is
now
10
u.s.c.
331,
that
the
president
could
call
the
militia
of
the
several
states
in
the
federal
service
and
authorizes
him
to
use
such
force
as
he
deems
necessary.
and
i
--
this
is
a
quote
from
the
provision
of
the
act,
“as
he
considers
necessary
to
suppress
insurrection.”
this
is
an
executive
function
reposed
in
the
president
of
the
united
states.
332
provides
that
whenever
the
president
considers
unlawful
obstructions,
combinations
or
assemblages
or
rebellion
against
the
authority
of
the
united
states,
make
it
impracticable
to
enforce
the
laws
of
the
united
states
and
in
any
state
or
territory
by
the
ordinary
course
of
judicial
proceedings,
he
may
call
into
the
service
of
the
militia
of
any
state
and
use
such
of
the
armed
forces
as
he
considers
necessary
to
enforce
those
laws
or
to
suppress
rebellion.
section
333
of
10
u.s.c.
provides
the
president
use
the
militia
or
the
armed
forces
for
both
or
any
other
means
and
“shall
take
such
measures
as
he
considers
necessary
to
suppress
in
a
state,
domestic
violence,
unlawful
combination
or
conspiracy
that
seriously
interferes
to
the
execution
of
laws
in
the
united
states.”
we
would
submit
in
this
regard
that
article
4,
section
4
of
the
constitution
makes
no
distinction
with
respect
to
presidential
powers
as
they
pertain
to
invasion
or
domestic
violence.
now,
we
turn
to
the
omnibus
crime
control
and
safe
streets
act
of
1968.
in
that
act,
in
subsection
3
of
2511
there
is
this
language,
nor
shall
anything
contained
in
this
chapter
be
deemed
to
limit
the
constitutional
power
of
the
president
to
take
such
measures
as
he
deems
necessary
to
protect
the
united
states
against
the
overflow
by
force
or
other
unlawful
means
or
against
any
other
clear
and
present
danger
to
the
structure
or
existence
of
government.
if
there
be
any
doubt
as
to
what
any
other
means
as
the
phrase
is
used
in
that
statutory
provision,
it
is
dispel
by
the
next
following
sentence.
the
contents
of
any
wire
or
oral
communication
intercepted
by
the
authority
of
the
president
in
the
exercise
of
a
foregoing
powers
may
be
received
in
evidence
in
any
trial
or
hearing
or
other
proceeding
only
where
such
interception
was
reasonable
and
shall
not
be
otherwise
used
or
disclosed
except
as
is
necessary
to
implement
that
power.
we
suggest,
your
honors,
that
in
the
exercise
of
this
function
by
the
president
of
the
united
states
there
is
of
course
a
discretion
vested
and
whenever
the
discretion
is
vested
there
is
of
course
the
chance
that
the
discretion
will
be
abused.
but
this
is
the
very
essence
of
our
government
and
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
at
the
time
of
our
continental
congress,
at
the
time
of
the
constitutional
convention,
at
the
time
this
very
constitution
was
enacted.
there
was
serious
question
as
to
whether
or
not
this
court
had
the
power
of
judicial
review.
it
was
asserted
at
that
time
when
this
court
consisted
of
five
members
that
a
majority
of
that
court
could,
if
it
had
the
power
of
judicial
review,
substitute
its
judgment,
for
the
judgment
of
both
houses
of
congress
and
the
people
of
the
united
states
that
elected
him.
justice
marshall
answered
the
question
but
i
think
alexander
hamilton
answered
it
even
more
eloquently
in
the
federalist
paper
number
80
in
which
he
said,
“to
argue
that
the
members
of
the
court
could
substitute
there
judgment
for
the
will
of
the
people
would
argue
that
there
ought
to
be
no
court.”
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
chief
justice
marshall,
i
believe
answered
the
question
in
the
same
way.
if
we
look
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
i
doubt
if
we
can
find
one
phrase
or
one
word
which
reposes
in
the
court
the
power
of
judicial
review.
but
justice
marshall
found
that
it
was
inherit
in
the
constitution
itself
that
this
--
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
sorry.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
we
suggest
in
this
regard
that,
we
are
not
asking
for
an
exemption
of
the
fourth
amendment.
we
do
not
suggest
the
president
is
above
the
fourth
amendment.
we
simply
suggest
that
in
the
area
in
which
he
has
limited
but
the
exclusive
authority
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
may
authorize
electronic
surveillance
and
in
those
cases
it
is
reasonable.
i
would
suggest
in
this
regard
that
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
prohibit
all
searches
and
seizures.
but
only
those
which
are
deemed
--
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
i
think
that
the
abuse
of
discretion
to
which
you
will
elude
is
possible
not
only
in
the
executive
function
but
in
the
judicial
as
well
as
the
legislative.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
i
think
that
–-
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
within
the
limited
procedures,
prescribed
by
the
statute
under
which
he
acts.
now,
if
he
chooses
to
violate
that
statute,
he
might
well
choose
to
violate
his
oath.
this
is
an
attribute
of
our
government
which
exists
and
has
always
existed.
but
i
would
also
suggest
in
this
regard
that
this
is
not
an
unbridled
discretion.
we
are
here
before
this
court
for
the
court
to
examine
whether
or
not
in
this
case
there
was
an
unbridled
discretion
or
an
abused
of
that
discretion.
if
i
may,
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
reserve
what
time
i
have
left
for
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
thank
you.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
--
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
pardon
me.
if
you
need
it,
we’ll
enlarge
your
time
about
two
minutes.
perhaps
you
won’t
need
it.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
i
don’t
think
i’ll
need
it.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes,
sir.
i
should
first
like
to
allude
to
the
statement
by
mr.
justice
stewart
with
reference
to
a
constitutional
definition
of
the
warrant.
i
am
unaware
of
any
constitutional
definition
of
a
warrant
as
such.
i
think
the
constitution
speaks
of
a
warrant
this
government
has
recognized
numerous
types
of
warrants.
i
think
in
footnote
13
of
our
brief,
in
our
reply
brief.
we
indicate
and
this
was
not
intended
to
be
a
comprehensive
search,
20
instances
where
the
congress
of
the
united
states
has
provided
for
either
warrantless
searches
or
searches
conducted
under
warrants
issued
by
persons
other
than
members
of
the
federal
judiciary.
counsel
have
cited
the
case
of
abel
versus
the
united
states.
in
fact,
we
urged
the
abel
case
in
the
sixth
circuit
court
and
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
sixth
circuit
court
when
referring
to
abel
stated
that
mr.
abel
was
arrested
by
a
warrant
which
the
opinion
of
the
court
found
to
have
been
lawfully
issued
by
a
lawfully
authorized
magistrate
and
that
the
material
seized
at
the
time
of
his
arrest
were
held
legally
admissible
as
incident
to
that
arrest.
a
decision
in
that
case
was
written
by
justice
frankfurter.
the
warrant
was
not
issued
by
a
magistrate.
the
warrant
was
issued
by
an
officer
in
the
department
of
immigration
and
naturalization
service,
a
subordinate
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states.
i
would
suggest
in
this
regard
that
while
the
warrant
requirement
as
it
pertains
to
judicial
proceedings
criminal
judicial
proceedings
especially
by
enlarge
are
issued
by
members
of
the
federal
judiciary.
there
is
a
great
body
in
statute
in
this
country
which
permits
not
only
warrantless
searches
which
we've
alluded
to
in
some
of
our
briefs
but
warrants
issued
by
persons
other
than
judicial
magistrates.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
pardon
me,
it’s
in
the
main
brief
(inaudible).
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
i
may
have
put
those
wrong,
sir
and
i'm
sorry
if
i
have.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
but
i
could
recite
the
20
instances.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes,
sir.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
i
--
on
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
which
i
believe
was
the
--
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes.
there
is
--
they
are
subject
to
--
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
the
judicial
review,
i
would
say
based
upon
the
warrant
requirement
in
each
case.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
well,
in
this
regard
i
was
interested
in
the
statement
by
mr.
gossett
in
which
he
says
that
he
is
in
dark
as
to
the
contents
of
the
in
camera
exhibit.
mr.
gossett
represents
the
respondent
court
and
the
respondent
court
certainly
had
in
its
possession
and
that
in
camera
exhibit
shouldn’t
have
been
available
if
it
wasn’t
to
the
attorney
for
the
respondent
court
as
distinguished
in
the
respondent
-
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
we
have
in
the
past
and
i
think
before
this
court
not
too
recently
submitted
to
this
court
in
camera
and
to
the
attorneys
for
the
parties
in
that
case
it
was
not
a
federal
district
judge
but
the
defendants
in
the
case
itself.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
no.
we
never
told
him
he
couldn’t.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
i
would
assume
that
at
the
time
this
matter
came
before
this
circuit
court
at
least
and
before
this
court,
when
mr.
gossett
became
counsel
of
record
had
to
--
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes,
sir.
he
may
see
it.
yes,
sir
mr.
justice
he
may
see
it
now.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
the
contents
i
presume
are
known
to
or
should
be
known
to
justice,
i
mean,
judge
keith
and
we
have
no
objection
to
mr.
gossett’s
viewing
the
in
camera
exhibits.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
mr.
gossett
who
represents
the
respondent
court
is
certainly
--
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
well,
there
only
--
there's
only
one
person
involve
contrary
with
counsel
statement.
the
only
overhearing
that
we
have
is
the
overhearing
of
the
defendant
plamondon.
the
other
two
are
here
before
this
court
only
because
--
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
plamondon,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
no.
the
government’s
positions
which
initiated
--
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
well,
we
would
not
having
adversary
proceeding
in
any
instance
where
the
overhearing
involved
matters
relating
to
the
national
security.
if
there
is
a
distinction
between
overhearings
in
so
called
foreign
intelligence
cases
as
distinguished
from
national
security
cases,
i
have
been
unable
as
objectively
as
i
can
to
do
distinguish
between
so
called
domestic
and
foreign
intelligence.
now,
counsel
brought
up
the
fact
that
in
one
of
our
footnotes
we
referred
to
some
documents
which
we
submitted
to
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeal
on
our
motion
to
augment
the
record.
that
case
came
up
--
was
tried
before
the
keith
case.
that
--
that’s
the
ferguson
or
smith
case.
in
mr.
--
judge
keith’s
opinion,
he
refers
in
extensile
to
the
opinion
of
just
--
judge
ferguson.
in
the
way
matter
arose
was
this,
in
the
smith
case
which
is
still
pending
before
this
court,
i
understand.
we
made
an
in
camera
submission
to
the
court
and
i
believe
that
in
camera
submission
consisted
a
one
sheet
of
paper
which
again
was
an
incidental
overhearing
of
the
defendant
smith.
we
urge
in
that
case
that
it
was
national
security
intelligence
tap
and
i
think
the
record
will
disclose
that
it's
the
same
tapped
that
is
before
this
court.
in
that
case,
we
urge
that
the
information
contained
in
the
log
should
not
be
disclosed
and
its
disclosure
would
not
be
in
the
interest
and
would
be
prejudicial
to
the
national
security.
we
did
not
argue
in
that
case
nor
was
the
question
raised
by
the
court
or
by
the
defendant
that
that
case
involved
a
domestic
intelligence
case.
yet,
in
the
determination
of
the
court
in
the
ninth
circuit
case,
judge
ferguson,
he
held
that
the
government
was
required
to
disclose
again
as
a
prelude
to
attain
hearing.
the
overhearing
on
the
grounds
that
and
he
used
the
term
13
separate
times,
purely
domestic
or
wholly
domestic
organization
or
purely
domestic
or
wholly
domestic
intelligence.
and
yet
the
only
basis
for
the
fact
determination
was
the
in
camera
submission
of
one
sheet
of
paper
which
indicated
the
overhearing
of
the
defendant’s
smith’s
voice.
for
that
reason
when
the
matter
went
before
the
ninth
circuit,
the
government
sought
to
augment
the
record
and
to
let
the
court
view
all
of
the
overhearings
of
the
surveillance
in
question
to
determine
whether
it
was
in
fact
wholly
domestic
or
purely
domestic
or
whether
it
was
a
wholly
domestic
or
purely
domestic
organization.
an
examination
of
the
logs
will
disclose
that
it’s
not
wholly
domestic
or
purely
domestic.
its
foreign
ties
exceeded
its
domestic
ties
and
it
was
for
that
reason
that
we
made
that
offer
to
the
court
in
the
ninth
circuit.
and
we
would
make
that
offer
to
this
court,
if
the
court
would
like
to
view
the
record
which
we
submitted
in
that
case.
now,
with
reference
to
why
we
footnoted
the
reference
to
the
smith
case,
that
footnote,
that
brief
was
drawn
at
the
time
that
judge
ferguson
sought
a
petition
in
this
court
for
certiorari
before
the
determination
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
we
acquiesce
in
that
petition
and
sought
to
have
this
court,
hear
both
cases
together
so
that
this
court
could
view
the
in
camera
submission
which
was
made
at
the
circuit
court
level
stage.
i
take
and
i
must
take
some
exception
to
the
characterization
of
this
case
as
an
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
engage
in
electronics
surveillance
for
the
purpose
of
observing
the
activities
of
decedent
political
groups.
the
statute
under
which
this
government
is
operating
certainly
prohibits
that.
i
would
also
point
out
that
this
whole
question
of
electronic
surveillance
in
what
is
disclosed.
this
court
must
is
a
coordinate
branch
of
government
rely
almost
entirely
on
the
integrity
of
the
executive
branch.
the
executive
branch,
it
was
the
executive
branch
through
the
then
solicitor
general
who
now
sits
on
this
court,
who
made
the
disclosure
to
this
court.
and
in
each
instance,
where
a
motion
is
made
under
rule
16,
it
is
the
integrity
of
the
government
that
has
to
be
relied
upon
unless
this
court
is
going
to
fashion
a
rule
which
would
permit
every
defendant
to
rummage
all
of
the
files
of
all
the
investigative
agencies
of
government.
now
administratively,
we
suggest
this
cannot
work.
administratively,
it
would
break
down
the
separation
of
powers
that
exist
between
government
and
would
also
break
down
the
entire
law
enforcement
function
of
government.
where
do
we
go
less
than
that?
when
the
motion
is
made,
the
government
responds.
if
the
government
is
not
to
be
trusted
to
respond
with
respect
to
a
motion
under
rule
16,
then
it
should
be
expected.
i
assume
from
what
counsel
said
to
respond
honestly
with
respect
to
the
nature
of
its
activities.
now
certainly,
this
neither
president
or
any
prior
president
to
my
knowledge
is
authorized
electronic
surveillance
to
monitor
the
activities
of
an
opposite
political
group.
the
only
purpose
is
--
as
i
have
stated;
one,
to
obtain
the
on
going
intelligence
necessary
to
compete
in
the
area
of
foreign
affairs
and
the
on-going
intelligence
necessary
for
this
nation
to
protect
itself
against
not
only
as
foreign
foes
but
its
domestic
foes.
now,
counsel
gossett
has
suggested
that
we
might
in
this
area
you
use
the
provisions
relating
to
cases
involving
sabotage
or
espionage.
i
would
submit
that
if
it
were
a
sabotage
case
or
an
espionage
case,
we
certainly
should
invoke
the
provisions
of
the
statute.
but
when
we’re
talking
about
the
on
going
intelligence
function
of
government,
there
is
no
probable
cause
in
many
cases
as
that
term
is
used
in
the
criminal
prosecuted
sense.
now,
i
do
not
know
that
it’s
an
appropriate
analogy
but
certainly
the
protection
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
against
assassination
is
one
aspect
to
the
nation’s
national
security.
heads
of
state
have
been
assassinated
to
bring
down
governments.
a
simply
--
simple
cursory
examination
of
the
warren
commission
report
will
find,
will
disclose
numerous
instances
by
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
and
the
secret
service
were
criticized
for
not
having
the
on
going
intelligence
necessary
to
provide
adequate
protection
to
the
president.
i
suggest
again
with
respect
to
the
provisions
of
article
4,
section
4
of
the
constitution
which
the
congress
has
--
execution
of
which
the
congress
is
placed
in
the
president.
there
is
no
distinction
in
the
constitutional
article
or
in
the
statutes
passed
pursuant
thereto
with
respect
to
the
presidential
authority
as
its
relates
to
invasion
or
civil
insurrection.
both
require
on
going
intelligence
because
without
that
intelligence,
the
president
cannot
make
an
appropriate
decision.
as
the
court
held
in
the
kennedy
case,
constitution
isn’t
a
suicide
act.
the
president
can’t
wait
until
the
moment
of
invasion
or
insurrection
to
start
putting
together
a
counterintelligence
function.
the
president
must
have
this
information
if
he’s
to
carry
out
his
responsibilities
under
the
constitution.
to
defend
this
nation
against
invasion
or
domestic
violence
and
we
submit
that
the
record
of
the
past
six
presidents
and
the
past
12
attorneys
general
is
deserving
of
the
high
esteem
of
this
court,
is
deserving
of
permitting
the
chief
executive
to
carry
out
his
functions
under
the
constitution
and
within
the
constraints
of
the
fourth
amendment
as
i
have
attempted
to
define
them
here.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
this
was
before
the
petition
for
writ
of
mandamus
was
filed
and
before
judge
keith
was
represented
by
mr.
gossett.
as
we
have
in
all
cases
to
my
knowledge
and
as
we
did
before
this
court
in
the
times
in
the
post
case.
we
permitted
an
examination
not
by
a
member
in
a
case
where
a
judge
wasn’t
involved
but
by
not
one
but
several
four
members
or
so.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
i
think
if
there
is
an
--
if
there
is
a
misunderstanding
in
this
case,
it
was
not
on
the
part
of
the
government,
had
the
request
been
made
most
assuredly.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
i
had
assumed
that
he
had
seen
it.
i
had
assumed
it.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
no,
sir.
if
mr.
gossett
says
he
hasn’t
seen
it,
he
hasn’t
seen
it.
but
had
mr.
gossett
requested
the
opportunity
to
see
the
in
camera
exhibit,
mr.
gossett
replication
is
such
that
who
would
be
no
question
if
the
government
acquiesce
on
that
demand.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
i
recently
responded
to
a
letter
from
senator
kennedy
of
massachusetts
and
i
set
forth
the
actual
figures
that
the
department
of
justice
had
with
respect
to
electronics
surveillance,
the
director
of
the
fbi,
mr.
hoover
testifies
annually
during
his
budget
hearings
and
will
be
testifying
within
the
next
week
into
as
to
the
extent
of
electronic
surveillance.
i
can
say
without
qualification
rather
than
it
is
being
increased
that
there
has
been
a
substantial
decreased
in
the
amount
of
electronic
surveillance
in
the
area
in
which
we
are
speaking.
that
is
a
matter
within
the
knowledge
of
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
and
when
requested
we
have
disclosed
on
some
occasions
of
the
--
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
we
consider
this
matter
as
did
the
committee
of
the
privy
council
of
england
as
to
how
often
you
should
distribute
the
figures.
certainly,
if
the
figures
are
disclosed
on
an
on
going
basis
of
information
relative
to
the
intelligence
function
of
government
can
be
gleaned.
but
we
did
on
that
occasion
in
response
to
senator
kennedy
give
him
the
figures
that
indicated
the
total
number
of
surveillances
for
the
entire
year,
the
maximum
number
at
each
time.
you
get
into
this
numbers
game
mr.
justice
and
you
get
--
you
have
problems
because
we,
in
our
brief
in
the
ninth
--
in
the
sixth
circuit
and
the
ninth
circuit
as
well,
indicated
the
figures,
the
testimony
of
the
director
of
the
fbi
before
congress
over
the
past
ten
years
and
those
figures
were
as
of
the
day
he
testify.
the
figures
i
gave
senator
kennedy
were
the
actual
figures
which
we
have
in
the
department
of
justice
and
included
not
one
a
particular
day
which
happened
to
coincide
with
director
hoover’s
testimony
but
the
maximum
number
on
any
day
and
the
total
number
for
the
entire
year
both
as
to
telephones
and
microphones.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes,
sir,
that
--
those
are
the
figures
testified
to
by
the
director
and
the
only
purpose
was
to
show
the
decreased.
we
were
not
intending
to
indicate
anything
other
than
the
fact
that
they
had
decreased
over
the
years.
i
believe
in
one
of
--
i
believe
there
has
been
references
as
justice
douglas
said
to
a
letter
from
senator
kennedy,
the
letter
was
to
me,
i
believe,
senator
and
i
responded.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
i
said
i
would
supply
them.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
c.
mardian
thank
you
very
much.
