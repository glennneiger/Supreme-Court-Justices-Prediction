all
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does

basis
for
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
gives
the
detailed
basis
for
why

is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
that
subject
to
any

by
anybody?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
how
limited?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
could
you

without
the
facts
of
some
kind?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
do
you
need
other
than
conclusions?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is

so
then
how
does
the
court
determine
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
persons
who
claim
that
right
not
to
be
surveyed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
that
not
be
shared
with
the
federal
judge
in
camera?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
let
me
ask
you
this,
doesn’t
the
federal
judge
take
the
same
oath
the
attorney
general
take?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
of
course
the
privy
council
isn’t
bound
by
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
here
is
the
petitioners,
i
mean,
the
respondents
rather
the
people
that
were
before
the
court
and
the
respondent
court
take
position
that
it
was.
and
they
want
to
find
out
whether
it
was?
am
i
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
cause
it
showed
that
it
wasn’t
use?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
clay
case
was
fined
espionage,
wasn’t
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
another
justice
by
the
name
of
marshall
solely
took
care
of
all
that,
didn’t
he?
chief
justice
marshall?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
keep
talking
--
the
fourth
amendment?
are
you
going
to
get
to
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
possible
under
your
theory
that
the
president
could
make
unreasonable
intrusion
into
the
private
life
of
citizen
of
this
country?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
not
talking
about
the
judicial
point.
i'm
talking
about
the
executive.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
i
understand
your
position
that
if
the
president
decides
as
necessary
to
bug
john
doe’s
phone,
that’s
it.
there
is
nothing
under
the
sun
john
jones
can
do
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.

in
all
of
these

all
subject
to
judicial
testing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
didn’t
say
on
any
writ.
they're
subject
to
judicial
testing?
justice
thurgood

in
your
position,
in
the
judicial
testimonies
and
adversary
proceeding
with
two
parties,
is
that
correct?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
isn’t
there
an
adversary
proceeding?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
here
we
don’t
have
an
adversary
proceeding.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
understood
that

for
the
eyes
of
the
judges
nobody
else.

i
right
or
