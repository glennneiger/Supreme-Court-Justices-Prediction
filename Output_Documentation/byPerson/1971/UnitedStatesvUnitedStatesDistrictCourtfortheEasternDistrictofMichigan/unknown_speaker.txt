unknown
speaker
well,
isn’t
the
constitution
expressly
reposes
the
executive
function
of
the
president
and
congress
passes
laws
and
the
president
executes
them?
unknown
speaker
but
wouldn’t
you
--
i
take
it
that
you
would
as
mr.
justice
stewart
suggested
congress
does
have
authority
in
this
area
and
i
take
it
from
your
answer
that
congress
could
forbid
the
president
from
doing
what
you
suggest
he
has
the
power
to
do
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
my
next
question
will
suggest
that
it
did?
would
you
say
though
that
congress
could
forbid
the
president?
unknown
speaker
let’s
assume
congress
says
then
that
the
attorney
general
or
the
president
may
authorize
the
attorney
general
on
specific
situations
as
to
carry
out
electronic
surveillance
if
the
attorney
general
certifies
that
there
is
a
clear
and
present
danger
to
the
security
of
the
united
states.
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
say
congress
would
have
the
power
to
limit
surveillances
to
situations
where
those
conditions
where
satisfied?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
this
affidavit
squares
with
this
safe
streets
act?
unknown
speaker
why
was
it
ever
filed
in
the
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
put
it
to
you
this
way,
do
you
think
the
affidavit
satisfied
alone
--
standing
alone
satisfies
the
safe
streets
act?
unknown
speaker
which
finding?
that’s
in
the
--
that
is
contained
in
the
in
camera
documents
or
in
the(voice
overlap)?
unknown
speaker
but
that
--
i
take
it
that
you
would
say
that
that
authorization
would
contain
something
of
substantive
differences
in
this
affidavit
filed
to
the
court.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
will
put
it
this
way,
if
all
the
in
camera
document
contain
with
was
this
affidavit
contain
and
the
document(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
may
--
maybe
it
contains
information
but
does
it
contain
a
certification
of
the
attorney
general
that
the
standards
set
down
by
the
safe
streets
act
that
are
complied
with?
unknown
speaker
he
didn’t
--
he
doesn’t
--
it
doesn’t
express
his
conclusion
in
so
many
words
that
this
represents
a
clear
and
present
danger
to
the
united
states?
unknown
speaker
this
arguments
--
do
you
make
and
even
on
the
assumption
that
the
surveillance
was
illegal?
unknown
speaker
even
if
the
surveillance
were
deemed
to
be
an
illegal
one
by
this
court
that
it
nevertheless
didn’t
taint
these
proceedings.
unknown
speaker
and
that
--
and
you
say
the
taint
should
be
considered
in
camera
rather
than
a
--?
unknown
speaker
and
that
position,
you
don’t
think
is
that
the
law
of
states
that
seems
inconsistent
with
alderman?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
from
your
brief
you
also
argued
that
nothing
in
the
safe
streets
act
precludes
this
kind
of
an
argument?
unknown
speaker
before
you
--
let
me
ask
you,
do
you
rely
on
the
safe
streets
act
at
all
as
an
authorization?
unknown
speaker
and
so
that
even
if
the
president's
absence
of
authorization
by
the
congress
didn’t
have
independent
constitutional
authority
to
do
this.
your
argument
is
the
safe
streets
act
authorizes
him
to
do
so
and
the
constitution
would
permit
the
congress
to
authorize
them
to
do
so?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
argument
helps
you
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
--
what
if
congress
made
it
clearly
express
the
statutes
said
that
the
electronic
surveillances
shall
be
carried
out
only
with
a
warrant
but
the
warrant
may
either
be
obtained
from
the
magistrate
or
from
the
president
of
united
states
and
then
this
had
been
the
particular
case,
the
president
issues
what
is
called
a
warrant
to
presume
the
statute.
i
find
there's
probable
cause
it
is
so
and
so.
he
issues
the
warrant.
unknown
speaker
you
would
say
that
would
be
unreasonable.
it’s
unreasonable
to
trust
part
of
the
united
states
as
much
as
you
trust
the
district
judge?
unknown
speaker
well,
you’d
say
it
doesn’t
fit
the
constitutional
definition
of
a
warrant?
unknown
speaker
no
matter
how
much
you
may
trust
the
individual?
unknown
speaker
and
a
warrant
--
a
warrant
within
the
constitutional
meaning
of
that
phrase
is
a
matter
of
definition
means
that
one
issued
by
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate.
unknown
speaker
not
by
either
one
of
the
parties.
unknown
speaker
did
the
--
before
you
sit
down
mr.
gossett,
is
there
--
did
the
district
judge
look
at
this
in
camara
submission?
unknown
speaker
is
that
on
the
record?
unknown
speaker
and
did
the
court
of
appeals
look
at
it?
unknown
speaker
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
look
at
the
--
unknown
speaker
yes,
i
see.
unknown
speaker
mr.
mardian,
you
--
i
thought
you
referred
us
to
footnote
13
of
your
reply
brief
and
i
can’t
find
it.
unknown
speaker
and
it’s
not
in
footnote
13
of
your
main
brief
that
i
see.
perhaps
i've
missed
something.
i
do
not
want
to
--
i
know
your
holding
your
time.
unknown
speaker
i
just
can’t
locate
what
you're
trying
to
--
unknown
speaker
no,
don’t
do
that.
i
would
be
interested
in
where
in
this
brief
afterwards,
if
you
did
submit
it
though.
unknown
speaker
that’s
perfectly
alright.
unknown
speaker
would
have
an
adversary
proceeding,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
mardian
the
record
has
been
made
here
today
to
wholesale
use
of
this
type
of
surveillance
indicating
that
it
had
been
sharply
on
the
increase.
unknown
speaker
what
are
the
actual
facts
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
it
is
currently
and
in
recent
years
has
been
use
more
frequently
than
five
years
or
ten
years
ago?
