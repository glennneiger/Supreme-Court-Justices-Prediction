by
whom,
the

fbi?
justice
potter
stewart
you
said
it
was
subject
to
periodic
review
and
by
whom?
justice
potter
stewart
by
the
attorney
general.
justice
potter
stewart
does
the
congress
of
the
united
states
has
a
great
deal
of
constitutional
authority
in
the
area
of
internal
security
and
domestic
affairs.
i
suppose
if
your
argument
is
correct
that
congress
could
delegate
an
agent
of
the
congress
to
do
this
investigative
surveillance,
could
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
my
question
is,
was
direct
to
this,
is
it
your
contention
that
only
the
president
has
this
power
through
the
appropriate
cabinet
officer
or
would
the
congress
not
also
have
at
least
equivalent
power
in
this
area,
if
you’re
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
broad
investigative
powers
that’s
been
held
many
times?
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
mean,
i’m
not
--
i
mean
that
if
you’re
right
that
the
executive,
the
chief
executive
can
do
this
through
his
designated
agent
cabinet
officer,
why
couldn’t
congress
equally
do
this
investigating
surveillance
throughout
the
country
through
its
designated
agent?
justice
potter
stewart
under
the
constitution,
you
think
it's
entrusted
exclusively
to
the
president?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
during
a
great
deal
of
that
period
mr.
gossett,
that
was
the
regime
of
amsted
and
of
goldman,
was
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
the
problem
was
not
a
fourth
amendment
problem
during
the
line
of
share
--
that
period
or
great
deal
of
that
period
and
in
effect
to
--
what
was
involved
was
a
provision
of
the
federal
communications
act.
justice

not

am
i
wrong
about
that.
