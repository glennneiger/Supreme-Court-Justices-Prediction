mr.
arthur
kinoy
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
i
rise
before
this
court
to
represent
the
three
individual
respondents
john
sinclair,
lawrence
plamondon,
and
john
forest.
but
as
the
court
of
appeals
has
stated
so
powerfully
in
the
opinion
before
this
court,
the
thrust
of
this
case
now
goes
far
beyond
the
rights
and
liberties
of
these
three
young
men.
the
government
has
seen
that
to
use
this
case
as
a
vehicle
for
propelling
a
claim
of
executive
power.
so
ominous
in
its
importation
and
sweeping
in
its
dimension
that
is
as
transform
this
appeal
into
a
case
which
as
this
court
has
said
touches
the
bedrock
of
our
political
system.
mr.
mardian
has
seen
fit
this
morning
to
call
upon
the
authority
of
the
great
chief
justice
in
mulberry.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
in
the
words
of
that
chief
justice
this
case
had
become
on
of
those
rare
cases
of
peculiar
delicacy
which
call
for
the
historic
role
of
this
court
as
the
ultimate
interpreter
of
the
constitution.
now,
the
considerations
i
suggest
to
the
court,
awesome
and
foreboding
which
permeate
the
opinions
of
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
arise
out
of
an
openly
expressed
and
prime
attempt
by
the
executive
to
use
this
case
to
obtain
the
imprimatur
of
this
court
for
a
program
of
domestic
and
i
stressed
that
word,
domestic
espionage
and
surveillance
of
political
opponents
on
presidents
in
our
history.
mr.
gossett
has
exposed
fully,
i
believe
the
essence
of
the
executive’s
claim
of
executive
power
to
engage
in
wholesale
wiretapping
of
american
citizens
without
regard
for
the
fourth
amendment
commands
of
prior
judicial
approval
by
a
neutral
magistrate.
the
very
point
of
the
first
amendment
--
of
the
fourth
amendment
which
this
court
has
thought
so
recently
in
coolidge,
in
camara
without
a
showing
of
probable
cause
or
the
necessity
of
particularity
whenever
in
his
sole
and
unchallenged
judgment
the
ideas,
associations
or
political
activities
of
these
citizens
may
constitute
an
attempt
and
here
i
used
his
words
to
subvert
the
existing
structure
of
the
government.
now,
as
mr.
gossett
has
pointed
out
and
in
the
words
of
judge
edwards
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit,
this
would
--
to
place
it
bluntly,
erase
the
fourth
amendment
from
the
domestic
light
of
this
country.
the
amendment
which
this
court
has
thought
is
the
embodiment
of
fundamental
principles
of
liberty.
but
i
would
like
to
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
most
serious
consequences
which
would
flow
from
this
court’s
placing
its
imprimatur
upon
this
claim
of
power
would
be
the
stifling
of
the
political
freedoms
guaranteed
by
the
first
amendment,
the
continued
vitality
of
which
rests.
it’s
been
great
deal
of
discussion
today
about
the
security
of
the
republic
and
the
security
of
this
government.
well,
mr.
mardian
did
not
include
in
his
discussion
to
the
court,
the
deepest
teachings
of
this
court
that
the
security
of
the
republic
basically
depends
upon
preserving
the
essence
of
this
system
of
political
freedom,
those
great
words
of
the
chief
justice.
justice
hughes
in
de
jonge,
preserving
the
essence
of
the
political
freedoms
of
the
country.
now
the
fear
or
the
excessive
and
uncontrolled
executive
power
which
permeates
the
court
of
appeals’
opinion
and
the
opinion
of
the
respondent
district
judge,
the
fear
of
this
power,
to
sweep
aside
fourth
amendment
protection
against
what?
against
warrantless
general
searches
and
seizures.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
not
since
the
days
in
1761
when
the
board
of
massachusetts
court,
james
otis
pleaded
a
case
as
a
more
classic
general
search
ever
come
before
this
court.
here
you
have
a
search
of
14
months
duration
by
the
government
words,
14
months
duration
over
900
telephone
calls
involving,
lord
knows
how
many
thousands
of
people
who
as
mr.
gossett
said
by
mistake
dialed
a
number.
now,
this
fear
which
is
reflected
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
of
this
unprecedented
in
his
power
is
based
not
only
on
the
contemporary
european
lessons
of
tear
news
this
country
is
not
supposed
to
be
reflect
but
is
based
i
suggest
on
the
most
important
of
our
own
experiences
as
a
people.
that
the
central
teaching
of
our
own
history
has
been
that
arbitrary
general
searches
and
seizures
always,
not
always
and
that
is
the
teaching
and
the
meaning
of
the
essence
of
our
experience
of
the
people
is
the
pact
to
the
assertion
of
theoretical
control
over
the
lives
of
people
and
this
i
suggest
to
the
court,
is
the
brilliant
heart
of
the
court
of
appeals’
opinion
which
is
here
for
review
by
this
court.
the
concepts
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
beyond
doubt,
the
first
amendment
is
the
cornerstone
of
american
freedom
and
the
fourth
amendment
stands
as
the
guardian
of
the
first
and
this
reflects
the
teaching
of
this
court
in
marcus,
that
the
bill
of
rights
itself,
the
fourth
amendment
was
fashioned
against
the
background
of
knowledge
that
unrestricted
power
of
search
and
seizure
was
an
instrument
for
stifling
liberty
of
expression.
now
the
power
which
the
attorney
general
seeks
here,
would
legitimatized
a
widespread
dragnet
of
a
secret
surveillance
of
domestic
political
opposition
of
which
the
present
record
appendix
a
to
our
brief
for
example
is
but
a
tiny
preview
already
the
subjects
of
the
attorney
general’s
suspicion
and
i
used
that
word
advisably
for
on
leaders
of
the
anti-war
movement,
black
militant,
catholic
activists,
pacifists,
advocates
of
youth
culture
but
what
is
the
deep
danger
to
the
country
that
this
claim
represent.
as
formulated
here
this
morning
and
in
the
brief
submitted
to
this
court,
that
claim
of
power
can
include
anyone
who
speaks
out.
now,
i
put
it
bluntly
to
the
court
that
this
is
not
an
exaggeration.
i
put
to
the
court
the
example
of
the
reason
suggestion
from
high
quarters
in
the
executive
department
that
critics
of
the
proposals
made
by
the
president
of
the
united
states
in
respect
to
the
vietnam
war
and
i
used
their
own
words,
are
consciously
aiding
and
abetting
the
enemy
of
the
united
states.
that
was
the
chief
of
staff
of
the
white
house
two
weeks
ago.
now,
i
suggest
to
the
court
would
these
critics
be
included
within
the
scope
of
this
domestic
surveillance.
they’re
aiding
and
abetting
the
enemy
of
the
united
states
during
there
phones
can
be
tapped.
now,
i
would
say
to
the
court
that
the
question
asked
by
this
court
in
baggett-bullitt,
where
does
principle
possibility
end
and
intended
coverage
begins
goes
to
the
heart
of
this
issue.
goes
to
the
heart
of
this
issue
unless
this
program
now
loudly
proclaimed
by
the
executive
of
uncontrolled
executive
warrantless
open
ended
wiretapping
of
domestic
political
opponents
unless
this
is
decisively
repudiated.
not
sidestepped
and
i
urge
deeply
decisively
repudiated
by
this
court,
the
inevitable
effect
will
be
not
to
--
and
here
i
pause
for
a
moment,
i
will
not
use
the
word
which
i
heard
the
solicitor
two
days
ago
before
this
court
say,
“was
overworked
in
this
court.”
i
will
not
say
that
the
inevitable
effect
will
be
to
chill
the
exercise
of
democratic
right.
i
would
say
the
inevitable
effect
will
be
to
choke
and
stifle.
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights
by
millions
of
american
citizen,
millions
of
american
citizens
and
i
call
to
the
court’s
attention
the
poignant
and
incisive
discussion
of
judge
kiley
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
seventh
circuit
in
his
fascinating
article,
private
in
black
standard,
which
he
warned
us
all.
speaking
of
this
pattern
and
danger
of
surveillance,
that
it
seems
enough
to
contemplate
this
specter
of
a
big
brother
observing
how
we
think,
we
feel
and
act
and
the
oppressive,
moral
and
political
climate
they
were
tend
to
suffocate
our
freedom.
now,
to
me
the
most
disturbing
aspect
of
this
case
is
the
frank
willingness
of
the
executive
to
engage
in
such
a
program
and
in
its
eagerness
to
sustain
such
a
program,
the
executive
attempt
to
evade
the
prohibitions
of
the
fourth
amendment.
the
question
justice
marshall
asked
from
the
bench
to
mr.
mardian
by
saying
as
--
mr.
mardian
said
here
this
morning
that
this
program
of
domestic
political
espionage
is
unrelated
to
any
criminal
investigated
activity
but
is
merely
unintelligence
gathering
operation.
but
what
mr.
mardian
does
not
discuss
is
that
attempt
to
evade
the
protections
of
the
fourth
amendment
was
repudiated
by
this
court
directly
squarely
and
head
on
in
camara.
when
the
opinion
of
the
court,
justice
white’s
opinion
of
the
court,
met
head
on
the
argument
there
made
by
the
state
authorities
that
we're
not
involved
in
this
fourth
amendment
problem
because
our
intention
is
not
to
look
for
criminal
violations,
we're
looking
for
other
things.
go
to
the
health
and
safety
of
the
community
and
this
court
said
that
that
misses
the
whole
point
and
what
did
it
do
in
the
fascinating
way.
the
majority
opinion
according
to
camara
adopted
approvingly
the
dissenting
opinion
of
justice
brennan
in
abel,
abel
against
united
states
in
which
the
justice
pointed
out
and
reflected
in
the
camara
opinion.
that
this
misses
the
whole
point
of
the
fourth
amendment
that
the
right
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment
is
not
the
right
to
be
secure
from
having
evidence
of
criminal
activity
taken
from
you
unreasonably.
that’s
not
the
right
to
protect
it.
the
right
to
protect
it
is
to
use
again
the
words
of
these
court
again
and
again.
the
sacred
inalienable
--
the
right
that
used
in
boyd,
the
words
in
boyd,
the
words
of
justice
brandies
in
olmstead,
the
absolute
right
to
privacy.
that
the
issue
is
not,
why
that
right
is
being
violated?
the
fourth
amendment
stands
to
protect
the
citizens
of
this
country
from
arbitrary
invasion
of
there
right.
it
stuns
me
a
little
bit
to
hear
the
arguments
made
by
a
representative
of
today’s
executive
which
were
made
by
the
representatives
of
george
the
iii
in
entick
against
carrington,
the
precise
argument.
this
court
is
told
as
was
the
british
court
in
entick
that
courts
cannot
look
at
the
reasons
for
the
searches.
that
resides
in
the
special
knowledge
of
the
crown.
the
british
court
was
told
in
entick,
you
must
sanction
this
general
search
for
--
and
neither
words
from
entick
for
reasons
of
state,
for
reasons
of
necessity.
no,
we
cannot
tell
you
all
the
facts
of
those
because
they
reside
in
the
head
of
our
chief
executive
officer
known
as
the
secretary
of
the
state.
those
were
precisely
the
arguments
raised
in
entick.
those
were
the
arguments,
the
fourth
amendment
was
designed
to
eliminate.
mr.
mardian’s
argument
is
not
with
us.
mr.
mardian’s
argument
is
with
those
who
wrote
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
mardian’s
argument
and
the
government’s
brief
reads
as
if
saying
that,
“oh,
it
is
perfectly
alright.
we
can
do
all
these
things
because
we
are
conducting
investigative
intelligence
gathering
as
if
the
executive
has
limitless
uncontrolled
powers
in
the
area
of
political
association
belief
and
activities.”
all
of
which
as
this
court
towards
in
stanford,
all
of
which
are
affected
by
the
general
searches
conducted
here,
as
if
the
general
searches
because
the
government
there
--
the
general
executive,
i
think
it
is
important
for
us
to
be
precise
in
our
language
here.
i
prefer
not
to
use
the
term,
"the
government"
here,
the
issue
was
too
profound
and
too
serious.
the
executive
says
that
if
these
general
searches
are
conducted
unrelated
to
the
purposes
of
immediate
criminal
prosecution
then
we
can
do
whatever
we
like.
in
the
vast
area
of
political
association
believes
in
activity
we
can
have
whatever
wiretapping
we
want
to
have
there.
it
doesn’t
matter
what
effect
it
has
on
people’s
willingness
to
engage
in
political
activity,
on
people’s
willingness
to
engage
in
political
association.
i
suggest
that
this
court
has
thought
and
only
recently
as
reaffirmed
the
profound
words
which
this
court
now
has
written
into
fundamental
law
of
justice
brandies
concurring
in
whitney
against
california,
only
recently
in
brandenburg
with
this
court
write
those
words
into
the
fabric
of
our
law,
that
government
action
which
impinges
on
the
delicate
and
vulnerable
freedom.
the
words
of
--
but
is
tolerated
if
at
all
only
when
required
to
prevent
the
most
eminent
immediate
serious
role
attraction
of
a
clear
and
present
danger
of
a
substantive
evil
of
a
serious
nature
within
the
power
of
the
government.
but
the
argument
of
the
executive
here
is
a
total
rejection
of
justice
brandies’
philosophy
and
the
philosophy,
i
suggest
of
this
court
and
the
philosophy
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
which
mr.
mardian
has
told
us
the
president
is
one
to
uphold.
because
the
executive
now
demands
the
power
for
general
searches
in
the
area
of
domestic
political
activity
in
the
absence
of
any
showing
of
probable
cause
for
criminal
prosecution
on
the
uncheck
say
so
of
one
man
and
we
were
told
this
morning
that
the
absolute
sacred
privacy
right
to
the
american
citizens
are
best
protected
in
the
hands
of
a
one
man.
now,
those
who
wrote
the
fourth
amendment
did
not
agree
with
that.
and
that
--
this
court
said
in
coolidge
just
last
term.
those
fundamental
values
are
sometimes
question
these
days.
this
court
said,
sometimes
people
feel
that
these
values,
they
don’t
work.
and
the
court
pointed
out
that
use
the
words,
feel
of
internal
subversion.
sometimes
makes
us
shake
about
these
values
but
that’s
what
this
court
seeks
here
for
is
to
protect
those
fundamental
values.
those
judgments
were
made
when
the
fourth
amendment
was
written.
now,
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
no
program
of
government
activities
which
touches
the
area
of
the
first
amendment
right
has
ever
come
before
this
court
for
review
which
so
totally
ignores
the
most
elementary
teachings
of
the
court.
examination
of
the
attorney
general’s
affidavit,
perhaps
the
most
imprecise,
overly
broad,
vague,
dragnet
type
standard,
words
ever
brought
before
the
court.
compare
it
to
the
words
sanctioned
in
governmental
actions
struck
down
in
baggett-bullitt,
struck
down
in
cramp,
struck
down
in
the
issue.
this
court
says
that
when
fourth
amendment
problem
touches
the
first
amendment,
in
the
stanford,
precision
and
strict
formulations
are
required.
this
is
--
has
reflect
precision,
strict
formulation.
now,
i
can
understand
why
the
government
is
so
desperately
trying
in
this
court
to
bury
the
attorney
general’s
affidavit
as
the
basis
for
there
action
upon
the
psychic’s
pricing
from
a
litigation
point
of
view,
from
an
elementary
thinnest
point
of
view
that
the
first
time
the
executive
takes
the
position
that
the
attorney
general’s
affidavit
is
not
what
you
look
to
define
the
basis
for
the
search.
the
first
time
they
took
that
position
is
in
the
reply
brief
we
got
five
days
before
this
oral
argument.
you
look
back
to
their
main
brief,
go
back
to
the
original
brief
filed
in
the
district
court
that
judge
keith
acted
on.
go
back
to
the
brief
filed
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
sixth
circuit
and
then
what’s
so
interesting,
recently
we
argued
in
the
seventh
circuit
the
identical
issue
with
other
representatives
of
the
executive
in
united
states
against
dillinger
and
in
the
seventh
circuit,
the
representatives
of
department
justice
got
up
and
said,
when
question
from
the
bench
as
to
what's
the
basis
for
the
searches.
they
all
look
at
the
attorney
general’s
affidavit
your
honor.
no!
in
this
court
now
they’re
running
from
that
affidavit.
it's
perfectly
clear
why
they're
running
from
the
affidavit.
cause
the
affidavit
on
its
face
reveals
the
fundamental
violation
of
the
first
and
fourth
amendment.
but
in
one
sense
there
is
something
deeply
serious
that
is
reflected
by
their
running
from
the
affidavit.
now
these
five
days
prior
to
argument,
the
citizens
are
not
even
allowed
to
know
the
basis
for
the
depravation
of
fundamental
right.
what
are
we
told?
no,
you
cannot
look
at
the
attorney
general’s
affidavit
any
longer.
that’s
not
the
reason
for
the
right
and
what
kind
of
limit
in
judicial
review
can
there
be
if
the
citizens
doesn’t
even
know.
forget
about
the
facts
underlying
the
action.
it
doesn’t
even
know
what
the
basic
for
it,
the
claim
of
right
to
set
aside
fourth
amendment
right.
that
basis
is
in
secret
document
which
in
a
magic
way
seem
to
enlarge
as
this
case
goes
on
--
the
documents
before
judge
keith.
then
all
of
a
sudden
there
is
supplemental
envelops
before
the
court
of
appeals.
then
all
of
a
sudden
there
are
new
envelops
filed
before
this
court
and
here
they’re
not
so
secret
these
envelops.
what’s
in
them?
because
whenever
it
suits
the
executive
convenience
they
tell
us
and
the
courts
openly,
publicly
what
are
in
them,
but
for
the
first
time
today,
they
were
astounding
to
me.
for
the
first
time
today,
we
were
told
in
this
litigation
that
in
these
envelopes
there
is
a
memorandum
from
the
head
of
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
discussing
prior
wiretaps
and
prior
surveillances.
we
never
heard
that
before?
well,
if
that
was
so
secret
that
it
can
now
be
discussed
and
openly
before
this
court,
why
weren’t
we
told
a
long
time
ago?
but
what
emerges
is
that
if
the
bases
for
the
deprivation
of
fundamental
rights
are
in
the
secret
documents
which
we
don’t
know
and
we
can’t
see,
which
we
can’t
even
challenge,
i
suggest
that
we
have
a
right.
now
in
1972,
we’ve
already
run
in
1984.
nothing
could
be
more
(inaudible).
nothing
could
be
more
grotesque.
in
the
situation
in
which
we
don’t
even
know
what
the
basis
for
the
deprivation
of
fundamental
rights.
what
does
this
do?
it
makes
a
mockery
of
any
pretense
of
judicial
review,
supposedly
a
safeguard.
now,
i
would
suggest
that
if
sanctioned
by
this
court,
this
warrantless
general
wiretapping
of
domestic
and
i
stress
that.
there
is
no
question
here
of
the
so
called
foreign
intelligence
exception
discussed
in
katz,
discussed
in
giordano.
this
was
not
supposed
to
be
a
test
case
from
the
government’s
point
view
from
the
executive’s
point
view
of
the
so
called
foreign
exception.
they
allowed
the
--
from
one
into
the
country
of
the
attorney
general’s
big
speeches
in
which
he
talked
about
this
case,
which
he
said
they
are
testing
the
domestic,
their
right
to
have
domestic
surveillance
of
so
called
domestic
subversion.
all
of
a
sudden
they
discovered
they
run
very
shaky
constitutional
grounds.
so
at
the
last
moment,
they
tried
to
infect
this
case
with
an
inference
of
foreign
affair.
why
suggest
to
this
court
that
it
is
not
so
difficult
to
disentangle
one
from
the
other?
that
this
throughout
the
history
of
this
country
have
been
the
sorts
of
the
most
serious
eroding,
the
most
serious
eroding
of
constitutional
liberties,
at
every
turning
point
in
the
history
of
a
nation
where
there’s
been
a
challenged
to
fundamental
constitutional
liberties,
it
has
always
been
in
the
name
of
foreign
agent.
when
the
first
attack
on
jefferson
and
the
jeffersonion
submerged,
what
was
it?
they
were
french
agents.
and
therefore
alien
position
act
was
alright.
first,
you
study
the
first
amendment.
pull
them
in
trial
for
sedition,
why?
because
they
were
french
agents,
foreign
agents.
this
court
is
well
aware
of
the
same
development
around
the
promenades
and
the
members
of
this
court
was
the
author
of
that
famouse
document
practically
with
the
department
of
justice,
justice
frankfurter.
pointing
out,
there
once
again
end
of
world
war
i,
the
fear
of
foreign
nation
was
the
thing
that
intermingled
into
a
cover
to
destroy,
what?
constitutional
protections
for
american
citizens,
for
american
citizens,
and
this
court
has
lived
through
and
proudly
emerged
from
the
period
of
time
we
all
know
as
the
period
of
the
mccarthy
period.
the
period
in
which
once
again
the
fear,
the
fear,
the
cold
fear
of
foreign,
foreign
elements
was
used.
why?
to
undermine
the
fifth
amendment,
the
present
solicitor
general
of
the
united
states
wrote
an
important
document
on
the
erosion
of
the
fifth
amendment
during
that
period
of
time.
i
suggest
we
face
that
problem
once
again
and
this
court
as
it
did
at
each
turning
point
in
our
history
must
stand
resolute
now
to
reject
this
effort
to
introduce
the
specter
of
this
fear
which
erodes
the
fundamental
rights
of
all
americans,
not
just
to
three
young
men
before
this
court.
i
think
the
serious
need
of
what
the
executive
is
asking
for
is
reflected
in
the
constitution
of
theory
which
it
now
emerges
full
blown.
the
theory
that
in
the
domestic
area,
there
is
an
inherent
power
to
do
whatever
the
executive
feels
is
necessary
to
be
done.
i
will
not
take
time
with
this
because
this
court
has
over
and
over
again
rejected
that
concept
only
this
last
june
in
new
york
times
in
a
powerful
opinion
of
the
late
justice
black.
that
doctrine
which
this
court
at
the
end
of
the
civil
war
called
the
most
pernicious
doctrine
in
ex
parte
milligan,
the
most
pernicious
doctrine
that
the
executive
do
with
inherent
powers
can
watch
suspend
constitutional
guarantee.
that’s
what
they’re
asking
for
here.
the
power
to
suspend
constitutional
guarantee
because
they
say.
no,
this
is
not
the
system
of
government
which
was
created
in
this
country.
the
system
of
government
which
is
created
in
this
country
is
that
system
of
limited
powers.
yes,
it
may
not
work
as
well
as
justice
frankfurter
pointed
out
in
youngstown,
may
not
work
as
well
as
some
other
government.
can
be
more
efficient,
the
oppressive
button
in
another
government
you
have
to
worry
about
warrants,
you
don’t
have
to
worry
about
courts,
do
what
you
want
to
do
but
that’s
why
this
country
was
set
up
in
the
way
it
was
and
that’s
why
this
court
sits.
precisely,
to
protect
this
country
and
the
citizens
of
this
country
from
the
erosion
of
the
fundamental
constitutional
values
which
make
us
strong
and
safe.
i
have
exhausted
my
time.
i
would
like
to
say
one
word
if
i
may
just,
one
word
on
the
last
question
which
the
executive
has
raised
here
in
respect
to
the
alderman
case,
the
alderman
opinion.
i
was
rather
surprised
to
hear
the
representative
of
the
executive
say
that
what
they
are
asking
for
in
there
brief
is
consistent
with
alderman
that
i
would
not
argue
that.
it’s
right
in
their
brief.
they
ask
this
court
to
reconsider
alderman.
they
ask
this
court
to
overrule
alderman.
they
ask
this
court
to
throw
out
its
decision
of
three
years
ago.
well
sort
out,
well
reasoned
and
the
thing
that
settles
the
inappropriateness
of
that
request
at
this
moment
is
the
question
the
chief
justice
asked
earlier
and
that
is,
that
the
court
of
appeals
itself
in
looking
at
these
lots
and
the
court
will
be
aware
of
that
at
the
end
of
he
opinion
said,
it
is
impossible
for
us
to
say
in
looking
at
this
very
conversations
that
they
might
not
have
been
prosecutorial
benefit,
and
therefore
it
has
to
be
adversary
hearing.
so
that
i
suggest
that
this
court
should
affirm
the
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit
and
in
affirming
the
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit,
this
court
will
be
affirming
the
fourth
and
the
first
amendments
of
the
constitutions
of
the
united
states.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
i
rise
before
this
court
to
represent
the
three
individual
respondents
john
sinclair,
lawrence
plamondon,
and
john
forest.
but
as
the
court
of
appeals
has
stated
so
powerfully
in
the
opinion
before
this
court,
the
thrust
of
this
case
now
goes
far
beyond
the
rights
and
liberties
of
these
three
young
men.
the
government
has
seen
that
to
use
this
case
as
a
vehicle
for
propelling
a
claim
of
executive
power.
so
ominous
in
its
importation
and
sweeping
in
its
dimension
that
is
as
transform
this
appeal
into
a
case
which
as
this
court
has
said
touches
the
bedrock
of
our
political
system.
mr.
mardian
has
seen
fit
this
morning
to
call
upon
the
authority
of
the
great
chief
justice
in
mulberry.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
in
the
words
of
that
chief
justice
this
case
had
become
on
of
those
rare
cases
of
peculiar
delicacy
which
call
for
the
historic
role
of
this
court
as
the
ultimate
interpreter
of
the
constitution.
now,
the
considerations
i
suggest
to
the
court,
awesome
and
foreboding
which
permeate
the
opinions
of
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
arise
out
of
an
openly
expressed
and
prime
attempt
by
the
executive
to
use
this
case
to
obtain
the
imprimatur
of
this
court
for
a
program
of
domestic
and
i
stressed
that
word,
domestic
espionage
and
surveillance
of
political
opponents
on
presidents
in
our
history.
mr.
gossett
has
exposed
fully,
i
believe
the
essence
of
the
executive’s
claim
of
executive
power
to
engage
in
wholesale
wiretapping
of
american
citizens
without
regard
for
the
fourth
amendment
commands
of
prior
judicial
approval
by
a
neutral
magistrate.
the
very
point
of
the
first
amendment
--
of
the
fourth
amendment
which
this
court
has
thought
so
recently
in
coolidge,
in
camara
without
a
showing
of
probable
cause
or
the
necessity
of
particularity
whenever
in
his
sole
and
unchallenged
judgment
the
ideas,
associations
or
political
activities
of
these
citizens
may
constitute
an
attempt
and
here
i
used
his
words
to
subvert
the
existing
structure
of
the
government.
now,
as
mr.
gossett
has
pointed
out
and
in
the
words
of
judge
edwards
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit,
this
would
--
to
place
it
bluntly,
erase
the
fourth
amendment
from
the
domestic
light
of
this
country.
the
amendment
which
this
court
has
thought
is
the
embodiment
of
fundamental
principles
of
liberty.
but
i
would
like
to
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
most
serious
consequences
which
would
flow
from
this
court’s
placing
its
imprimatur
upon
this
claim
of
power
would
be
the
stifling
of
the
political
freedoms
guaranteed
by
the
first
amendment,
the
continued
vitality
of
which
rests.
it’s
been
great
deal
of
discussion
today
about
the
security
of
the
republic
and
the
security
of
this
government.
well,
mr.
mardian
did
not
include
in
his
discussion
to
the
court,
the
deepest
teachings
of
this
court
that
the
security
of
the
republic
basically
depends
upon
preserving
the
essence
of
this
system
of
political
freedom,
those
great
words
of
the
chief
justice.
justice
hughes
in
de
jonge,
preserving
the
essence
of
the
political
freedoms
of
the
country.
now
the
fear
or
the
excessive
and
uncontrolled
executive
power
which
permeates
the
court
of
appeals’
opinion
and
the
opinion
of
the
respondent
district
judge,
the
fear
of
this
power,
to
sweep
aside
fourth
amendment
protection
against
what?
against
warrantless
general
searches
and
seizures.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
not
since
the
days
in
1761
when
the
board
of
massachusetts
court,
james
otis
pleaded
a
case
as
a
more
classic
general
search
ever
come
before
this
court.
here
you
have
a
search
of
14
months
duration
by
the
government
words,
14
months
duration
over
900
telephone
calls
involving,
lord
knows
how
many
thousands
of
people
who
as
mr.
gossett
said
by
mistake
dialed
a
number.
now,
this
fear
which
is
reflected
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
of
this
unprecedented
in
his
power
is
based
not
only
on
the
contemporary
european
lessons
of
tear
news
this
country
is
not
supposed
to
be
reflect
but
is
based
i
suggest
on
the
most
important
of
our
own
experiences
as
a
people.
that
the
central
teaching
of
our
own
history
has
been
that
arbitrary
general
searches
and
seizures
always,
not
always
and
that
is
the
teaching
and
the
meaning
of
the
essence
of
our
experience
of
the
people
is
the
pact
to
the
assertion
of
theoretical
control
over
the
lives
of
people
and
this
i
suggest
to
the
court,
is
the
brilliant
heart
of
the
court
of
appeals’
opinion
which
is
here
for
review
by
this
court.
the
concepts
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
beyond
doubt,
the
first
amendment
is
the
cornerstone
of
american
freedom
and
the
fourth
amendment
stands
as
the
guardian
of
the
first
and
this
reflects
the
teaching
of
this
court
in
marcus,
that
the
bill
of
rights
itself,
the
fourth
amendment
was
fashioned
against
the
background
of
knowledge
that
unrestricted
power
of
search
and
seizure
was
an
instrument
for
stifling
liberty
of
expression.
now
the
power
which
the
attorney
general
seeks
here,
would
legitimatized
a
widespread
dragnet
of
a
secret
surveillance
of
domestic
political
opposition
of
which
the
present
record
appendix
a
to
our
brief
for
example
is
but
a
tiny
preview
already
the
subjects
of
the
attorney
general’s
suspicion
and
i
used
that
word
advisably
for
on
leaders
of
the
anti-war
movement,
black
militant,
catholic
activists,
pacifists,
advocates
of
youth
culture
but
what
is
the
deep
danger
to
the
country
that
this
claim
represent.
as
formulated
here
this
morning
and
in
the
brief
submitted
to
this
court,
that
claim
of
power
can
include
anyone
who
speaks
out.
now,
i
put
it
bluntly
to
the
court
that
this
is
not
an
exaggeration.
i
put
to
the
court
the
example
of
the
reason
suggestion
from
high
quarters
in
the
executive
department
that
critics
of
the
proposals
made
by
the
president
of
the
united
states
in
respect
to
the
vietnam
war
and
i
used
their
own
words,
are
consciously
aiding
and
abetting
the
enemy
of
the
united
states.
that
was
the
chief
of
staff
of
the
white
house
two
weeks
ago.
now,
i
suggest
to
the
court
would
these
critics
be
included
within
the
scope
of
this
domestic
surveillance.
they’re
aiding
and
abetting
the
enemy
of
the
united
states
during
there
phones
can
be
tapped.
now,
i
would
say
to
the
court
that
the
question
asked
by
this
court
in
baggett-bullitt,
where
does
principle
possibility
end
and
intended
coverage
begins
goes
to
the
heart
of
this
issue.
goes
to
the
heart
of
this
issue
unless
this
program
now
loudly
proclaimed
by
the
executive
of
uncontrolled
executive
warrantless
open
ended
wiretapping
of
domestic
political
opponents
unless
this
is
decisively
repudiated.
not
sidestepped
and
i
urge
deeply
decisively
repudiated
by
this
court,
the
inevitable
effect
will
be
not
to
--
and
here
i
pause
for
a
moment,
i
will
not
use
the
word
which
i
heard
the
solicitor
two
days
ago
before
this
court
say,
“was
overworked
in
this
court.”
i
will
not
say
that
the
inevitable
effect
will
be
to
chill
the
exercise
of
democratic
right.
i
would
say
the
inevitable
effect
will
be
to
choke
and
stifle.
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights
by
millions
of
american
citizen,
millions
of
american
citizens
and
i
call
to
the
court’s
attention
the
poignant
and
incisive
discussion
of
judge
kiley
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
seventh
circuit
in
his
fascinating
article,
private
in
black
standard,
which
he
warned
us
all.
speaking
of
this
pattern
and
danger
of
surveillance,
that
it
seems
enough
to
contemplate
this
specter
of
a
big
brother
observing
how
we
think,
we
feel
and
act
and
the
oppressive,
moral
and
political
climate
they
were
tend
to
suffocate
our
freedom.
now,
to
me
the
most
disturbing
aspect
of
this
case
is
the
frank
willingness
of
the
executive
to
engage
in
such
a
program
and
in
its
eagerness
to
sustain
such
a
program,
the
executive
attempt
to
evade
the
prohibitions
of
the
fourth
amendment.
the
question
justice
marshall
asked
from
the
bench
to
mr.
mardian
by
saying
as
--
mr.
mardian
said
here
this
morning
that
this
program
of
domestic
political
espionage
is
unrelated
to
any
criminal
investigated
activity
but
is
merely
unintelligence
gathering
operation.
but
what
mr.
mardian
does
not
discuss
is
that
attempt
to
evade
the
protections
of
the
fourth
amendment
was
repudiated
by
this
court
directly
squarely
and
head
on
in
camara.
when
the
opinion
of
the
court,
justice
white’s
opinion
of
the
court,
met
head
on
the
argument
there
made
by
the
state
authorities
that
we're
not
involved
in
this
fourth
amendment
problem
because
our
intention
is
not
to
look
for
criminal
violations,
we're
looking
for
other
things.
go
to
the
health
and
safety
of
the
community
and
this
court
said
that
that
misses
the
whole
point
and
what
did
it
do
in
the
fascinating
way.
the
majority
opinion
according
to
camara
adopted
approvingly
the
dissenting
opinion
of
justice
brennan
in
abel,
abel
against
united
states
in
which
the
justice
pointed
out
and
reflected
in
the
camara
opinion.
that
this
misses
the
whole
point
of
the
fourth
amendment
that
the
right
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment
is
not
the
right
to
be
secure
from
having
evidence
of
criminal
activity
taken
from
you
unreasonably.
that’s
not
the
right
to
protect
it.
the
right
to
protect
it
is
to
use
again
the
words
of
these
court
again
and
again.
the
sacred
inalienable
--
the
right
that
used
in
boyd,
the
words
in
boyd,
the
words
of
justice
brandies
in
olmstead,
the
absolute
right
to
privacy.
that
the
issue
is
not,
why
that
right
is
being
violated?
the
fourth
amendment
stands
to
protect
the
citizens
of
this
country
from
arbitrary
invasion
of
there
right.
it
stuns
me
a
little
bit
to
hear
the
arguments
made
by
a
representative
of
today’s
executive
which
were
made
by
the
representatives
of
george
the
iii
in
entick
against
carrington,
the
precise
argument.
this
court
is
told
as
was
the
british
court
in
entick
that
courts
cannot
look
at
the
reasons
for
the
searches.
that
resides
in
the
special
knowledge
of
the
crown.
the
british
court
was
told
in
entick,
you
must
sanction
this
general
search
for
--
and
neither
words
from
entick
for
reasons
of
state,
for
reasons
of
necessity.
no,
we
cannot
tell
you
all
the
facts
of
those
because
they
reside
in
the
head
of
our
chief
executive
officer
known
as
the
secretary
of
the
state.
those
were
precisely
the
arguments
raised
in
entick.
those
were
the
arguments,
the
fourth
amendment
was
designed
to
eliminate.
mr.
mardian’s
argument
is
not
with
us.
mr.
mardian’s
argument
is
with
those
who
wrote
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
mardian’s
argument
and
the
government’s
brief
reads
as
if
saying
that,
“oh,
it
is
perfectly
alright.
we
can
do
all
these
things
because
we
are
conducting
investigative
intelligence
gathering
as
if
the
executive
has
limitless
uncontrolled
powers
in
the
area
of
political
association
belief
and
activities.”
all
of
which
as
this
court
towards
in
stanford,
all
of
which
are
affected
by
the
general
searches
conducted
here,
as
if
the
general
searches
because
the
government
there
--
the
general
executive,
i
think
it
is
important
for
us
to
be
precise
in
our
language
here.
i
prefer
not
to
use
the
term,
"the
government"
here,
the
issue
was
too
profound
and
too
serious.
the
executive
says
that
if
these
general
searches
are
conducted
unrelated
to
the
purposes
of
immediate
criminal
prosecution
then
we
can
do
whatever
we
like.
in
the
vast
area
of
political
association
believes
in
activity
we
can
have
whatever
wiretapping
we
want
to
have
there.
it
doesn’t
matter
what
effect
it
has
on
people’s
willingness
to
engage
in
political
activity,
on
people’s
willingness
to
engage
in
political
association.
i
suggest
that
this
court
has
thought
and
only
recently
as
reaffirmed
the
profound
words
which
this
court
now
has
written
into
fundamental
law
of
justice
brandies
concurring
in
whitney
against
california,
only
recently
in
brandenburg
with
this
court
write
those
words
into
the
fabric
of
our
law,
that
government
action
which
impinges
on
the
delicate
and
vulnerable
freedom.
the
words
of
--
but
is
tolerated
if
at
all
only
when
required
to
prevent
the
most
eminent
immediate
serious
role
attraction
of
a
clear
and
present
danger
of
a
substantive
evil
of
a
serious
nature
within
the
power
of
the
government.
but
the
argument
of
the
executive
here
is
a
total
rejection
of
justice
brandies’
philosophy
and
the
philosophy,
i
suggest
of
this
court
and
the
philosophy
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
which
mr.
mardian
has
told
us
the
president
is
one
to
uphold.
because
the
executive
now
demands
the
power
for
general
searches
in
the
area
of
domestic
political
activity
in
the
absence
of
any
showing
of
probable
cause
for
criminal
prosecution
on
the
uncheck
say
so
of
one
man
and
we
were
told
this
morning
that
the
absolute
sacred
privacy
right
to
the
american
citizens
are
best
protected
in
the
hands
of
a
one
man.
now,
those
who
wrote
the
fourth
amendment
did
not
agree
with
that.
and
that
--
this
court
said
in
coolidge
just
last
term.
those
fundamental
values
are
sometimes
question
these
days.
this
court
said,
sometimes
people
feel
that
these
values,
they
don’t
work.
and
the
court
pointed
out
that
use
the
words,
feel
of
internal
subversion.
sometimes
makes
us
shake
about
these
values
but
that’s
what
this
court
seeks
here
for
is
to
protect
those
fundamental
values.
those
judgments
were
made
when
the
fourth
amendment
was
written.
now,
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
no
program
of
government
activities
which
touches
the
area
of
the
first
amendment
right
has
ever
come
before
this
court
for
review
which
so
totally
ignores
the
most
elementary
teachings
of
the
court.
examination
of
the
attorney
general’s
affidavit,
perhaps
the
most
imprecise,
overly
broad,
vague,
dragnet
type
standard,
words
ever
brought
before
the
court.
compare
it
to
the
words
sanctioned
in
governmental
actions
struck
down
in
baggett-bullitt,
struck
down
in
cramp,
struck
down
in
the
issue.
this
court
says
that
when
fourth
amendment
problem
touches
the
first
amendment,
in
the
stanford,
precision
and
strict
formulations
are
required.
this
is
--
has
reflect
precision,
strict
formulation.
now,
i
can
understand
why
the
government
is
so
desperately
trying
in
this
court
to
bury
the
attorney
general’s
affidavit
as
the
basis
for
there
action
upon
the
psychic’s
pricing
from
a
litigation
point
of
view,
from
an
elementary
thinnest
point
of
view
that
the
first
time
the
executive
takes
the
position
that
the
attorney
general’s
affidavit
is
not
what
you
look
to
define
the
basis
for
the
search.
the
first
time
they
took
that
position
is
in
the
reply
brief
we
got
five
days
before
this
oral
argument.
you
look
back
to
their
main
brief,
go
back
to
the
original
brief
filed
in
the
district
court
that
judge
keith
acted
on.
go
back
to
the
brief
filed
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
sixth
circuit
and
then
what’s
so
interesting,
recently
we
argued
in
the
seventh
circuit
the
identical
issue
with
other
representatives
of
the
executive
in
united
states
against
dillinger
and
in
the
seventh
circuit,
the
representatives
of
department
justice
got
up
and
said,
when
question
from
the
bench
as
to
what's
the
basis
for
the
searches.
they
all
look
at
the
attorney
general’s
affidavit
your
honor.
no!
in
this
court
now
they’re
running
from
that
affidavit.
it's
perfectly
clear
why
they're
running
from
the
affidavit.
cause
the
affidavit
on
its
face
reveals
the
fundamental
violation
of
the
first
and
fourth
amendment.
but
in
one
sense
there
is
something
deeply
serious
that
is
reflected
by
their
running
from
the
affidavit.
now
these
five
days
prior
to
argument,
the
citizens
are
not
even
allowed
to
know
the
basis
for
the
depravation
of
fundamental
right.
what
are
we
told?
no,
you
cannot
look
at
the
attorney
general’s
affidavit
any
longer.
that’s
not
the
reason
for
the
right
and
what
kind
of
limit
in
judicial
review
can
there
be
if
the
citizens
doesn’t
even
know.
forget
about
the
facts
underlying
the
action.
it
doesn’t
even
know
what
the
basic
for
it,
the
claim
of
right
to
set
aside
fourth
amendment
right.
that
basis
is
in
secret
document
which
in
a
magic
way
seem
to
enlarge
as
this
case
goes
on
--
the
documents
before
judge
keith.
then
all
of
a
sudden
there
is
supplemental
envelops
before
the
court
of
appeals.
then
all
of
a
sudden
there
are
new
envelops
filed
before
this
court
and
here
they’re
not
so
secret
these
envelops.
what’s
in
them?
because
whenever
it
suits
the
executive
convenience
they
tell
us
and
the
courts
openly,
publicly
what
are
in
them,
but
for
the
first
time
today,
they
were
astounding
to
me.
for
the
first
time
today,
we
were
told
in
this
litigation
that
in
these
envelopes
there
is
a
memorandum
from
the
head
of
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
discussing
prior
wiretaps
and
prior
surveillances.
we
never
heard
that
before?
well,
if
that
was
so
secret
that
it
can
now
be
discussed
and
openly
before
this
court,
why
weren’t
we
told
a
long
time
ago?
but
what
emerges
is
that
if
the
bases
for
the
deprivation
of
fundamental
rights
are
in
the
secret
documents
which
we
don’t
know
and
we
can’t
see,
which
we
can’t
even
challenge,
i
suggest
that
we
have
a
right.
now
in
1972,
we’ve
already
run
in
1984.
nothing
could
be
more
(inaudible).
nothing
could
be
more
grotesque.
in
the
situation
in
which
we
don’t
even
know
what
the
basis
for
the
deprivation
of
fundamental
rights.
what
does
this
do?
it
makes
a
mockery
of
any
pretense
of
judicial
review,
supposedly
a
safeguard.
now,
i
would
suggest
that
if
sanctioned
by
this
court,
this
warrantless
general
wiretapping
of
domestic
and
i
stress
that.
there
is
no
question
here
of
the
so
called
foreign
intelligence
exception
discussed
in
katz,
discussed
in
giordano.
this
was
not
supposed
to
be
a
test
case
from
the
government’s
point
view
from
the
executive’s
point
view
of
the
so
called
foreign
exception.
they
allowed
the
--
from
one
into
the
country
of
the
attorney
general’s
big
speeches
in
which
he
talked
about
this
case,
which
he
said
they
are
testing
the
domestic,
their
right
to
have
domestic
surveillance
of
so
called
domestic
subversion.
all
of
a
sudden
they
discovered
they
run
very
shaky
constitutional
grounds.
so
at
the
last
moment,
they
tried
to
infect
this
case
with
an
inference
of
foreign
affair.
why
suggest
to
this
court
that
it
is
not
so
difficult
to
disentangle
one
from
the
other?
that
this
throughout
the
history
of
this
country
have
been
the
sorts
of
the
most
serious
eroding,
the
most
serious
eroding
of
constitutional
liberties,
at
every
turning
point
in
the
history
of
a
nation
where
there’s
been
a
challenged
to
fundamental
constitutional
liberties,
it
has
always
been
in
the
name
of
foreign
agent.
when
the
first
attack
on
jefferson
and
the
jeffersonion
submerged,
what
was
it?
they
were
french
agents.
and
therefore
alien
position
act
was
alright.
first,
you
study
the
first
amendment.
pull
them
in
trial
for
sedition,
why?
because
they
were
french
agents,
foreign
agents.
this
court
is
well
aware
of
the
same
development
around
the
promenades
and
the
members
of
this
court
was
the
author
of
that
famouse
document
practically
with
the
department
of
justice,
justice
frankfurter.
pointing
out,
there
once
again
end
of
world
war
i,
the
fear
of
foreign
nation
was
the
thing
that
intermingled
into
a
cover
to
destroy,
what?
constitutional
protections
for
american
citizens,
for
american
citizens,
and
this
court
has
lived
through
and
proudly
emerged
from
the
period
of
time
we
all
know
as
the
period
of
the
mccarthy
period.
the
period
in
which
once
again
the
fear,
the
fear,
the
cold
fear
of
foreign,
foreign
elements
was
used.
why?
to
undermine
the
fifth
amendment,
the
present
solicitor
general
of
the
united
states
wrote
an
important
document
on
the
erosion
of
the
fifth
amendment
during
that
period
of
time.
i
suggest
we
face
that
problem
once
again
and
this
court
as
it
did
at
each
turning
point
in
our
history
must
stand
resolute
now
to
reject
this
effort
to
introduce
the
specter
of
this
fear
which
erodes
the
fundamental
rights
of
all
americans,
not
just
to
three
young
men
before
this
court.
i
think
the
serious
need
of
what
the
executive
is
asking
for
is
reflected
in
the
constitution
of
theory
which
it
now
emerges
full
blown.
the
theory
that
in
the
domestic
area,
there
is
an
inherent
power
to
do
whatever
the
executive
feels
is
necessary
to
be
done.
i
will
not
take
time
with
this
because
this
court
has
over
and
over
again
rejected
that
concept
only
this
last
june
in
new
york
times
in
a
powerful
opinion
of
the
late
justice
black.
that
doctrine
which
this
court
at
the
end
of
the
civil
war
called
the
most
pernicious
doctrine
in
ex
parte
milligan,
the
most
pernicious
doctrine
that
the
executive
do
with
inherent
powers
can
watch
suspend
constitutional
guarantee.
that’s
what
they’re
asking
for
here.
the
power
to
suspend
constitutional
guarantee
because
they
say.
no,
this
is
not
the
system
of
government
which
was
created
in
this
country.
the
system
of
government
which
is
created
in
this
country
is
that
system
of
limited
powers.
yes,
it
may
not
work
as
well
as
justice
frankfurter
pointed
out
in
youngstown,
may
not
work
as
well
as
some
other
government.
can
be
more
efficient,
the
oppressive
button
in
another
government
you
have
to
worry
about
warrants,
you
don’t
have
to
worry
about
courts,
do
what
you
want
to
do
but
that’s
why
this
country
was
set
up
in
the
way
it
was
and
that’s
why
this
court
sits.
precisely,
to
protect
this
country
and
the
citizens
of
this
country
from
the
erosion
of
the
fundamental
constitutional
values
which
make
us
strong
and
safe.
i
have
exhausted
my
time.
i
would
like
to
say
one
word
if
i
may
just,
one
word
on
the
last
question
which
the
executive
has
raised
here
in
respect
to
the
alderman
case,
the
alderman
opinion.
i
was
rather
surprised
to
hear
the
representative
of
the
executive
say
that
what
they
are
asking
for
in
there
brief
is
consistent
with
alderman
that
i
would
not
argue
that.
it’s
right
in
their
brief.
they
ask
this
court
to
reconsider
alderman.
they
ask
this
court
to
overrule
alderman.
they
ask
this
court
to
throw
out
its
decision
of
three
years
ago.
well
sort
out,
well
reasoned
and
the
thing
that
settles
the
inappropriateness
of
that
request
at
this
moment
is
the
question
the
chief
justice
asked
earlier
and
that
is,
that
the
court
of
appeals
itself
in
looking
at
these
lots
and
the
court
will
be
aware
of
that
at
the
end
of
he
opinion
said,
it
is
impossible
for
us
to
say
in
looking
at
this
very
conversations
that
they
might
not
have
been
prosecutorial
benefit,
and
therefore
it
has
to
be
adversary
hearing.
so
that
i
suggest
that
this
court
should
affirm
the
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit
and
in
affirming
the
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit,
this
court
will
be
affirming
the
fourth
and
the
first
amendments
of
the
constitutions
of
the
united
states.
thank
you,
your
honor.
