mr.
william
t.
gossett
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
by
designation
of
the
state
bar
and
you
know
i
am
here
to
represent
the
respondent
in
the
mandamus
proceeding
in
the
district
court
of
michigan
and
judge
keith
of
that
court.
mr.
kinoy
and
i
have
made
up
a
loose
arrangement
for
dividing
the
argument
here
and
that
in
addition
to
supplementing
my
argument
on
the
main
issue
he
will,
i
think,
deal
specially
and
specially
with
the
matter
of
the
alderman
decision.
we
do
not
intend
however
to
suggest
or
discourage
any
questions
from
the
court
or
from
either
of
us
on
any
point.
i
want
to
come
soon
to
the
government’s
papers
but
not
too
soon
because
i
am
very
clear
on
one
thing
the
government’s
case
has
many
infirmities,
fundamental
infirmities
that
go,
that
transcend
the
form
of
their
papers.
there
may
have
been
controversy
in
this
court
in
the
past
about
the
scope
and
about
the
wisdom
of
the
recognized
exceptions
to
the
warrant
requirement
but
prior
to
this
case,
there
has
never
been
a
serious
challenge
to
the
basic
rule
that
ordinarily
searches
and
seizures
must
be
made
pursuant
to
duly
issued
warrants
and
if
they’re
not,
they
are
unreasonable.
indeed,
the
government
for
40
years
has
admitted
repeatedly
that
the
fruits
of
electronic
surveillance,
the
fruits
of
unauthorized
searchers
and
seizures
are
not
admissible
in
evidence
to
all
during
this
period
to
which
mr.
justice
marshall
referred
when
the
department
of
justice
was
operating
under
presidential
authority.
the
government
admitted,
during
all
that
period,
that
the
fruits
of
their
searches
were
not
admissible
in
evidence.
mr.
william
t.
gossett
yes
sir.
mr.
william
t.
gossett
yes.
mr.
william
t.
gossett
which
--
you’re
quite
right
mr.
justice
stewart
and
the
--
under
the
interpretation
of
that
act
by
the
attorney
general,
the
proscription
was
against
disclosure
and
all
the
attorney
generals
admitted
that
the
disclosure
point
that
they
could
not
disclose
and
if
they
disclosed
the
fruits,
there
was
a
violation
of
the
act.
but
during
of
all
of
that
period
the
attorney
general
sponsored
many
bills
in
congress
to
secure
the
right
to
wiretap
and
all
of
those
bills
where
either
defeated
or
withdrawn
because
congress
was
concern
about
the
definition
of
more
power
about
national
security
and
that
they
were
afraid
abuses
and
so,
not
until
1968
was
legislation
adopted
that
overrode
the
1934
act.
obviously,
this
case
--
in
this
case
the
government
does
not
claim
that
the
electronic
searcher
falls
within
the
--
in
any
of
the
recognized
exemptions.
it
seeks
instead
that
it
did
in
katz.
a
new
exemption
indeed,
it
seeks
for
all
searches
that
the
attorney
general
may
have
characterized
or
may
label
national
security,
an
exemption
from
any
meaningful
judicial
supervision
either
before
or
after
the
search.
thus,
the
government
in
effect
presents
a
startling
proposition.
it
is
that
also
called
national
security
searches
and
seizures
are
non-justiciable.
they
simply
are
beyond
the
reach,
beyond
the
competence
of
the
courts.
they
are
for
the
attorney
general,
the
executive
alone.
the
wiretap
here
involved
was
ordered
because
and
only
because
the
attorney
general
unilaterally
determined
that
it
was
reasonable
to
gather
domestic
intelligence
information
deemed
necessary
as
he
put
it,
now
i
want
be
of
clear
about
his
language,
to
protect
the
nation
from
attempts
of
the
domestic
organizations
to
attack
and
submerge
the
existing
structure
of
the
government.
mr.
william
t.
gossett
the
government
claims
in
this
case
that
the
--
and
claims
that
in
all
cases
of
national
security
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
fruits
of
wiretaps
secured
in
connection
with
so-called
intelligence
information
gathering
should
be
admissible
of
evidence
in
a
criminal
case,
that’s
our
position.
and
they
--
they
are
--
they've
set
up
here
a
conflict
between
the
physical
security
of
this
country
and
the
right
of
these
defendants
to
privacy.
that's
not
the
decision
that
the
district
court
made.
that’s
not
the
decision
that
the
court
of
the
appeals
made.
and
that’s
not
the
decision
before
this
court.
that’s
not
the
question
before
this
court.
their
question
before
this
court
is
whether
the
fourth
amendment
is
going
to
be
protected,
whether
the
protections
of
the
fourth
amendment
are
going
to
be
respected,
whether
people
are
going
to
be
protected
against
arbitrary
power
of
government.
that’s
a
decision
that
the
court
of
appeals
made.
and
that’s
a
decision
that
we
hope
this
court
would
make.
in
preparing
his
affidavit
in
this
case,
the
attorney
general
did
not
even
comply
with
the
statutory
standard
on
which
he
himself
relies.
established
by
congress
in
1968,
it
says
specifically
not
only
in
there
main
brief
but
then
they
have
five
briefs
that
is
the
standard.
now,
let
me
direct
--
let
me
invite
the
court’s
attention
if
i
may
to
the
record
here.
there’s
some
confusion,
i
don’t
know
how
to
define
it.
i
don’t
know
how
the
court
can
be
other
than
confused
about
the
record
in
the
case
here.
may
i
direct
your
attention
to
--
i
invite
your
attention
to
the
page
3
of
the
main
government
brief
first.
this
is
what
the
attorney
general’s
affidavit
said
about
documents
that
after
they
say
that
the
wiretap
is
applied
to
purpose
i‘ve
stated
and
then
paragraph
4,
submitted
with
this
affidavit
is
a
sealed
exhibit
containing
one,
the
records
of
intercepted
conversations;
two,
a
description
and
let
me
explain
that
the
lower
court,
let
me
be
sure
that
you
understand
that
lower
court
direction
here
is
only
that
the
plamondon
conversation
be
disclosed,
nothing
else,
just
a
plamondon
which
the
government
says
was
fortuitous,
he
dialed
the
wrong
a
number,
two,
a
description
of
the
premises
that
were
the
subject
of
the
surveillances;
and
three,
copies
of
the
memorandum
reflecting
the
attorney
general’s
expressed
approval
of
the
installation
of
the
surveillances.
now,
next
up
let
me
suggest
that
we
go
page
9
of
the
government’s
reply
brief.
they
broaden
the
scope
there
a
bit,
they
say,
“respondent
district
judge
urges
that
it
complains
about
the
standard
employed
here
and
that
we
can
make
the
point
that
they
haven’t
complied
with
the
standard”
which
we
certainly
do.
now,
i’ll
come
back
to
that,
the
affidavit
however,
says
the
government
was
not
authorization
to
the
surveillance
in
response
to
defendant’s
motion
under
rule
16,
affidavit
was
prepared
and
transmitted
to
the
court
together
with
the
in
camera
submission.
this
submission
contains:
(1)
the
signed
authorization
of
the
attorney
general.
(2)
documents
characterizing
the
illegal
activities
and
names
of
the
authorization
in
question
including
information
relating
to
the
means
by
which
it
intended
to
achieve
its
aims.
(3)
a
summary
inventory
of
prior
monitored
conversations.
(4)
a
document
relating
to
the
previous
authorization
of
the
prior
attorney
general.
(5)
a
description
of
the
in
premises
involved
in
all
overhearings
of
the
defendant
respondent
plamondon.
those
documents
and
not
the
affidavit
are
the
proper
basis
for
determining
the
ground
of
upon
which
the
attorney
general
acted.
third,
let
us
go
to
page
30
of
the
government’s
main
brief
if
we
--
if
i
may.
there's
a
footnote
there
after
footnote
13
on
page
30,
defendant
plamondon
was
not
the
subject
and
so
forth.
the
next
paragraph,
we
obliged
with
the
clerk
of
this
court
for
it’s
in
camera
consideration
the
same
exhibit
we
submitted
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
ferguson
case.
this
was
aaddressed
to
this
court
which
involves
the
same
issue
as
the
present
case
and
is
now
pending
in
the
petition
through
for
a
writ
of
certiorari.
now,
that
sentence
ought
to
be
read
as
carefully
as
it
was
written.
it
does
not
say
that
the
material
in
the
exhibit
was
in
the
record
of
the
ninth
circuit
case.
the
fact
is
that
it
is
not
in
the
record
of
the
ninth
circuit
case.
it
was
submitted
to
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
ninth
circuit
we
understand
we
are
lively
informed
by
former
deputy
attorney
general
who
represented
judge
ferguson
out
there
that
that
material
was
submitted
by
the
government.
they
where
requested
to
make
a
motion.
they
made
a
motion.
the
motion
has
not
been
decided.
so
that
material
to
which
the
government
--
on
which
the
government
says
that
is
relies
for
the
authority,
the
attorney
general
for
the
considerations
that
motivated
the
attorney
general.
not
in
the
record
of
this
case.
was
not
in
the
record
of
the
sixth
circuit
and
not
in
the
record
of
the
ninth
circuit.
so
how
does
it
become
material?
it's
not
available
to
us
and
let
me
point
out
that
on
page
8
of
the
reply
brief
of
the
government.
they
make
some
vague
statements.
they
have
always
taken
the
position.
they
took
the
position
in
the
--
in
their
affidavit,
in
their
memorandum
of
law
in
opposition
to
the
motion
to
suppress
to
the
lower
court.
they
took
the
position
in
the
court
of
appeals.
and
they
took
the
position
in
there
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
in
this
case
that
the
issue
here
was
one
of
domestic
security,
domestic
surveillance,
domestic
organizations.
now,
they
say
and
this
is
as
far
as
they
go
and
this
is
as
much
as
they
say
on
page
8,
the
fact
that
an
organization
is
domestic
does
not
mean
that
its
activities
cannot
involve
foreign
intelligence
operations.
a
domestic
organization
for
example,
may
have
a
large
number
of
significant
foreign
contacts
in
association
that
may
influence,
may
have
a
large
number,
and
may
influence
or
they
even
call
these
domestic
activities.
similarly,
individuals
connect
with
the
domestic
organization
themselves
may
have
such
foreign
ties
and
then
they
go
on
to
say,
it’s
a
practical
impossibility
to
find
the
distinctions
such
as
organization
unless
one
uses
the
principle
of
geographic
size
and
so
on.
the
district
court
did
not
consider
this
problem
but
granted
decision
on
the
fact
that
the
organization
is
distinguished
from
the
intelligence
sought
was
wholly
domestic.
the
point
is
that,
the
argument
was
not
made
before
the
district
court.
it
was
not
made
in
the
court
of
appeals.
it
is
not
made
in
the
writ
of
certiorari
to
this
case
that
--
and
there
--
and
that
there
is
no
assertion
now
in
any
document,
not
even
in
this
reply
brief
that
this
organization,
this
“domestic
organization”
it
has
foreign
ties
or
is
influenced
by
foreigners.
there's
no
such
statement
and
so,
i
do
not
know
how
this
court
can
base
its
decision
in
this
case
on
adequacy
to
papers
on
any
such
record.
now
if
i
may,
i
want
to
read
the
rest
of
the
affidavit,
the
rest
of
the
footnote
on
page
30
and
31
starting
at
the
bottom
at
the
bottom
of
page
30.
we
think
these
records
demonstrates
that
any
characterization
of
the
organization
in
question
is
domestic,
is
in
the
court
of
--
mr.
william
t.
gossett
the
--
it’s
the
main
brief
of
the
government,
page
30
and
the
footnote,
last
paragraph
of
the
footnote
beginning
on
page
30,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
think
these
records
demonstrate
at
any
characterization
of
the
organization
in
question
is
domestic
is
unsupportable.
for
example,
over
a
14
month-period,
521
telephone
calls
were
made
from
this
installation,
the
foreign
and
overseas
installations
and
another
430
calls,
the
contents
of
which
deal
with
foreign
subject
matter
replaced
to
domestic
installations.
now,
that’s
a
sole
basis
for
the
government’s
claim
for
that
--
there’s
any
foreign
intelligence
involves
here.
and
i
--
who
characterized
that,
it
says
any
characterization
of
the
organization
as
domestic.
who
characterized
this
as
domestic?
why,
it's
perfectly
clear
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
characterizes
it
as
domestic
and
he
is
never
in
any
paper
stated
otherwise,
stated
facts
that
are
available
to
us
as
a
basis
for
any
other
characterization.
mr.
william
t.
gossett
well,
i
think
that
it
would
then
depend
on
the
facts
and
circumstances
and
i
think
that’s
the
very
purpose
of
the
warrant
requirement
to
set
up
those
facts
and
circumstances,
have
counsel
explain
to
the
court
what
the
significance
with
other
relations
as
where
and
have
the
court
perform
its
constitutional
role
to
determine
whether
the
--
an
intrusion
is
proper,
what
to
do
extent
of
the
intrusion
and
so
on,
all
the
requirements
whether
they're
probable
cause
for
the
intrusion.
mr.
william
t.
gossett
this
court
has
reserved
expressly
the
matter
of
the
power
of
the
president
in
the
foreign
field.
we
don’t
have
it
involved
here.
i
think
the
president
perhaps
has
extraordinary
powers
in
the
foreign
field
but
even
there,
let
me
make
a
point
if
i
may.
if
i
could
ask
you
to
turn
to
our
brief,
page
--
in
the
appendix
of
our
briefs.
we
set
out
there
section
2511
(3)
whereas
consists
in
the
appendix
of
the
blue
covered
brief,
we
submit.
its
from
the
omnibus
crime
and
safe
streets
act
of
1968,
2511
this
language
was
obviously
very
carefully
drawn
and
it
appears
in
a
statute
that
is
very
carefully
drawn
that
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
this
country
abides
for
electronic
surveillance
with
the
court
order
and
provides
that
in
case
of
national
security
searchers
and
seizures,
that
the
government
may
proceed
without
a
court
order
provided
that
within
48
hours
after
the
surveillance
starts
they
get
a
court
order
or
apply
for
court
order.
that’s
the
expressed
provision
of
congress
with
respect
to
national
security
cases.
now
2511
(3)
nothing
contain
in
this
chapter
or
in
section
605,
the
communications
act
of
1934.
now,
we
deal
first
i
think
with
the
foreign
power,
shall
limit
the
constitutional
power
of
the
president
to
take
such
measures
as
he
deemed
necessary
to
protect
the
nation
against
actual
or
potential
attack
or
other
hostile
acts
of
a
foreign
power
to
obtain
foreign
intelligence
information
deemed
essential
to
the
security
of
the
united
states
or
to
protect
national
security
information
against
foreign
intelligence
activities.
three
times
that
use
foreign,
the
word
foreign,
foreign
power,
foreign
intelligence
information.
now,
the
next
sentence
i
think
deals
with
the
domestic
side,
nor
shall
anything
contain
in
this
chapter
be
deemed
to
limit
the
constitutional
power
of
the
president,
to
take
such
measures
as
he
deems
necessary
same
language,
to
protect
the
united
states
against
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
or
other
unlawful
means
or
against
any
other
clear
and
present
danger
to
the
structure
or
the
existence
of
the
government.
now,
why
i
didn’t
we
--
quite
aside
from
the
facts
that
are
not
available
to
us?
why
could
not
the
government
of
the
united
states
follow
the
prescribed
languages
with
respect
to
domestic
activities?
the
word
“intelligence”
is
not
used
but
the
word
“force”
and
the
words
“unlawful
action”
and
“clear
and
present
danger.”
none
of
those
words
are
used,
have
been
used
not
only
in
the
affidavit
have
been
use
any
document
in
this
case.
mr.
william
t.
gossett
i
think
if
they
were
employed
by
the
foreigners,
they
might
be
part
of
a
foreign
operation.
but
let
me
--
mr.
william
t.
gossett
i
think
so.
i
think
so
and
the
--
wherein
the
doctrine,
mr.
chief
justice
about
the
facts,
all
we
know
is
that
the
fact
--
that
the
attorney
general
said
and
said
to
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
this
is
a
domestic
organization,
nothing
about
foreign
activities
and
the
most
i
have
said
is
that
foreign
activities
may
be
involved.
that
in
the
domestic
organization
not
this
one
but
in
domestic
organization,
foreign
activities
may
be
involved.
may
i
just
read,
i
call
your
attention
to
the
last
sentence
and
that’s
very
carefully
drawn
paragraph.
mr.
william
t.
gossett
i'm
still
on
the
appendix.
yes,
on
2511
(3).
the
contents
of
any
wire
or
oral
communication
intercepted
by
authority
of
the
president,
this
was
read
by
mr.
mardian,
right.
i
read
it
differently
than
he
does.
i
see
significance
in
it
that
he
did
not
point
out.
in
the
exercise
the
foregoing
powers
may
be
received
in
evidence
in
any
trial
hearing
or
other
proceedings
only
where
such
interception
was
reasonable.
now,
and
shall
not
be
otherwise
be
use
to
disclose
except
if
it
is
necessary
to
implement
that
power.
what
does
reasonable
mean?
well,
the
committee
reports
are
quite
clear
on
this
subject.
they
interpret
reasonable
just
as
this
court
interpreted
in
camara
and
in
katz
and
in
berger.
they
say
reasonable
the
test
reasonable
is
a
standard
reasonableness
shall
be
the
probable
cause
test
under
the
fourth
amendment.
they
make
it
very
clear.
so
when
they
use
this
--
the
congress
used
this
language
they
meant
that
in
a
domestic
situation
if
the
government
expected
to
use
the
evidence
--
the
fruits
of
the
electronic
surveillance
in
evidence
then
they
must
--
it
must
be
reasonably
obtained
and
that
means
under
the
fourth
amendment
probable
cause
test.
they
say,
the
government
says
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
prohibit
all
searches
and
seizures
without
warrant
but
only
unreasonable
ones.
the
test
for
determining
reasonable
as
they
say
is
to
weigh
the
competing
interest
involved
and
they
then
purport
the
balance
of
competing
interest.
and
they
say,
they
find
naturally,
that
the
government
interest
in
protecting
national
security,
the
physical
security
of
this
country
had
ways
the
invasion
of
personal
rights
result
--
resulting
from
the
surveillance.
of
course,
it
ignores
the
essential
second
step
in
the
procedure
and
as
i
say
there
is
unfair
weighing
if
they
are
weighing
the
national
security
against
the
rights
of
these
three
defendants.
but
determination
of
whether
search
is
unreasonable
involved
more
than
a
weighing
of
the
competing
interest,
the
process
must
begin
with
to
quote
this
court
in
camara,
i
never
known
that
correct
pronunciation,
i
hope
it’s
camara.
one
governing
principles
justified
by
history
by
current
experience
that
is
consistently
been
followed
that
except
and
certainly
carefully
defined
classes
of
cases
of
search
of
private
property
without
proper
consent
is
unreasonable
unless
it
had
been
authorized
by
a
valid
search
warrant.
the
warrant
procurement
is
not
merely
one
method
of
assuring
reasonable
search,
it
is
crucial
and
it
is
generally
indispensable.
probable
cause
set
in
the
court
in
camara
is
the
standard
by
which
the
constitutional
mandate
a
reasonable
as
it
is
tested
and
the
burden,
the
burden
is
on
those
seeking
an
exemption
from
warrant
requirement
the
show
a
need
for
it.
not
just
a
need
to
search
but
the
need
the
search
without
a
warrant.
now,
of
course
there’s
a
governmental
interests
who
would
dispute.
there's
a
governmental
interests
in
protecting
the
fabric
of
society
so
as
the
government
puts
in
his
brief.
but
that’s
not
the
interests
as
take
in
this
case.
in
camara,
as
you
recall
and
that
almost
identical
argument
was
made
in
principle,
“that
the
general
health
and
safety
of
the
entire
urban
population
is
dependent
upon
enforcement
of
minimum
fire
housing
and
sanitation
standard.”
then,
thus
it
was
claim
at
required
systematized
inspection
of
all
physical
structures
about
a
warrant.
but
as
this
court
noted
the
argument
missed
the
mark.
the
question
knows
not
whether
these
inspections
may
be
made
but
whether
they
may
be
made
without
a
warrant
and
so
it
is
in
this
case.
but
the
warrant
procurement
is
no
mere
formality.
we
agree
with
the
attorney
general
that
the
president
is
responsible
for
ensuring
our
system
of
government
as
a
viable
entity.
indeed
his
duty
is
even
greater
than
that,
greater
and
more
formidable.
he
sworn
not
to
protect
the
government
as
such
but
to
preserve,
protect,
and
defend
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
but
his
powers
must
be
exercise
and
the
need
for
information
satisfied
to
a
constitutionally
proper
means.
and
the
constitution
limits
the
president
even
in
his
most
awesome
responsibilities
that
this
court
has
held
in
a
number
of
cases
and
that
we
don’t
subscribe
to
the
inherent
power
of
argument,
the
government
made
it
in
the
lower
court
and
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
would
do
formatting
its
main
brief
in
this
case
and
now
it
seems
to
back
to
the
inherent
power
of
argument.
we
think
--
mr.
william
t.
gossett
i
think
the
fourth
amendment
contemplates
and
provided
for
judicial
process
mr.
justice.
i
don’t
think
that
would
be
judicial
process.
i
think
that
what
the
government
--
what
the
generations
of
americans
were
talking
about
formulated
the
fourth
amendment
was
a
neutral
magistrate,
a
detached
magistrate
and
the
president
is
a
political
man
and
i
don’t
think,
and
so
is
the
department
of
justice,
(inaudible)
work
for
him.
they're
politicians
and
they
should
not
be
given
the
power
to
determine
how
much
and
how
long
and
how
great
will
be
the
intrusion
of
private
citizens
in
this
country.
and
that’s
what
the
government
is
arguing
for
in
this
case.
mr.
william
t.
gossett
i
think
so.
mr.
william
t.
gossett
i
think
it
does
not.
mr.
william
t.
gossett
that’s
right.
i
may
trust
this
administration.
i'm
talking
about
a
long
over
period.
mr.
william
t.
gossett
this
is
court
has
so
held.
mr.
william
t.
gossett
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
t.
gossett
i
would
indeed
accept
that
i
think
congress
has
a
power
to
set
up
standards
from
which
the
--
mr.
william
t.
gossett
could
not
pass
upon
the
standards
that’s
asked
upon
the
facts,
i
agree.
yes,
sir
--
mr.
william
t.
gossett
yes.
that’s
our
position
and
of
course
they
have
set
up
standards
in
the
1968
act
and
i
think
that
act
has
gone
a
long
way
to
solve
some
of
the
problems
here.
and
the
act
deals
with
such
crimes
as
espionage,
sabotage,
presidential
assassination,
treason,
all
of
these
things
that
the
government
says
are
unsafe
for
the
courts
to
deal
with.
they're
too
complicated.
they
can’t
deal
with
these
matters
but
they
must
be
dealt
with
the
by
executive
and
is
--
in
his
great
--
with
his
great
wisdom
and
knowledge
and
background
on
this
matter.
they
must
be
dealt
with
by
the
executive.(voice
overlap)
well
are
you
--
are
you
arguing
mr.
gossett
that’s
whatever
the
scope
of
inherent
power
prior
to
the
1968
act.
if
the
1968
act
has
now
spoken
to
this
subject
and
controls,
is
that
your
argument?
mr.
william
t.
gossett
so
far
as
congress
is
concern,
it
does,
it
has.
i
think
congress
has
left
open
a
couple
of
questions
that
with
deference
to
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
position
of
this
court
in
certain
cases.
but
so
far
as
securing
wiretaps,
wiretapping
and
intruding
into
the
lives
of
private
citizens
in
this
country.
i
think,
congress
has
spoken
and
it
has
stated
the
policy
very
precisely
and
elaborately.
the
language
was
--
is
very
carefully
drawn.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
t.
gossett
he
did
and
i'm
glad
you
answered
that
because
he
found
expressly
precisely
that
having
looked
at
it
that
he
could
not
make
a
determination
as
to
the
significance
of
it
from
a
prosecutorial
benefit
point
of
view.
he
could
not
make
a
determination.
mr.
william
t.
gossett
it’s
in
the
record,
it's
a

i'm
sorry
i
don’t

pardon?
mr.
william
t.
gossett
no,
the
district
court
made
so
much
no
such
finding.
the
court
of
appeals
did.
mr.
william
t.
gossett
and
that
we
don’t
really
know
what
was
before
the
court
of
appeals.
we
have
one
listed
of
documents
as
i
pointed
out.
yes,
i'll
(inaudible).
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
t.
gossett
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
by
designation
of
the
state
bar
and
you
know
i
am
here
to
represent
the
respondent
in
the
mandamus
proceeding
in
the
district
court
of
michigan
and
judge
keith
of
that
court.
mr.
kinoy
and
i
have
made
up
a
loose
arrangement
for
dividing
the
argument
here
and
that
in
addition
to
supplementing
my
argument
on
the
main
issue
he
will,
i
think,
deal
specially
and
specially
with
the
matter
of
the
alderman
decision.
we
do
not
intend
however
to
suggest
or
discourage
any
questions
from
the
court
or
from
either
of
us
on
any
point.
i
want
to
come
soon
to
the
government’s
papers
but
not
too
soon
because
i
am
very
clear
on
one
thing
the
government’s
case
has
many
infirmities,
fundamental
infirmities
that
go,
that
transcend
the
form
of
their
papers.
there
may
have
been
controversy
in
this
court
in
the
past
about
the
scope
and
about
the
wisdom
of
the
recognized
exceptions
to
the
warrant
requirement
but
prior
to
this
case,
there
has
never
been
a
serious
challenge
to
the
basic
rule
that
ordinarily
searches
and
seizures
must
be
made
pursuant
to
duly
issued
warrants
and
if
they’re
not,
they
are
unreasonable.
indeed,
the
government
for
40
years
has
admitted
repeatedly
that
the
fruits
of
electronic
surveillance,
the
fruits
of
unauthorized
searchers
and
seizures
are
not
admissible
in
evidence
to
all
during
this
period
to
which
mr.
justice
marshall
referred
when
the
department
of
justice
was
operating
under
presidential
authority.
the
government
admitted,
during
all
that
period,
that
the
fruits
of
their
searches
were
not
admissible
in
evidence.
mr.
william
t.
gossett
yes
sir.
mr.
william
t.
gossett
yes.
mr.
william
t.
gossett
which
--
you’re
quite
right
mr.
justice
stewart
and
the
--
under
the
interpretation
of
that
act
by
the
attorney
general,
the
proscription
was
against
disclosure
and
all
the
attorney
generals
admitted
that
the
disclosure
point
that
they
could
not
disclose
and
if
they
disclosed
the
fruits,
there
was
a
violation
of
the
act.
but
during
of
all
of
that
period
the
attorney
general
sponsored
many
bills
in
congress
to
secure
the
right
to
wiretap
and
all
of
those
bills
where
either
defeated
or
withdrawn
because
congress
was
concern
about
the
definition
of
more
power
about
national
security
and
that
they
were
afraid
abuses
and
so,
not
until
1968
was
legislation
adopted
that
overrode
the
1934
act.
obviously,
this
case
--
in
this
case
the
government
does
not
claim
that
the
electronic
searcher
falls
within
the
--
in
any
of
the
recognized
exemptions.
it
seeks
instead
that
it
did
in
katz.
a
new
exemption
indeed,
it
seeks
for
all
searches
that
the
attorney
general
may
have
characterized
or
may
label
national
security,
an
exemption
from
any
meaningful
judicial
supervision
either
before
or
after
the
search.
thus,
the
government
in
effect
presents
a
startling
proposition.
it
is
that
also
called
national
security
searches
and
seizures
are
non-justiciable.
they
simply
are
beyond
the
reach,
beyond
the
competence
of
the
courts.
they
are
for
the
attorney
general,
the
executive
alone.
the
wiretap
here
involved
was
ordered
because
and
only
because
the
attorney
general
unilaterally
determined
that
it
was
reasonable
to
gather
domestic
intelligence
information
deemed
necessary
as
he
put
it,
now
i
want
be
of
clear
about
his
language,
to
protect
the
nation
from
attempts
of
the
domestic
organizations
to
attack
and
submerge
the
existing
structure
of
the
government.
mr.
william
t.
gossett
the
government
claims
in
this
case
that
the
--
and
claims
that
in
all
cases
of
national
security
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
fruits
of
wiretaps
secured
in
connection
with
so-called
intelligence
information
gathering
should
be
admissible
of
evidence
in
a
criminal
case,
that’s
our
position.
and
they
--
they
are
--
they've
set
up
here
a
conflict
between
the
physical
security
of
this
country
and
the
right
of
these
defendants
to
privacy.
that's
not
the
decision
that
the
district
court
made.
that’s
not
the
decision
that
the
court
of
the
appeals
made.
and
that’s
not
the
decision
before
this
court.
that’s
not
the
question
before
this
court.
their
question
before
this
court
is
whether
the
fourth
amendment
is
going
to
be
protected,
whether
the
protections
of
the
fourth
amendment
are
going
to
be
respected,
whether
people
are
going
to
be
protected
against
arbitrary
power
of
government.
that’s
a
decision
that
the
court
of
appeals
made.
and
that’s
a
decision
that
we
hope
this
court
would
make.
in
preparing
his
affidavit
in
this
case,
the
attorney
general
did
not
even
comply
with
the
statutory
standard
on
which
he
himself
relies.
established
by
congress
in
1968,
it
says
specifically
not
only
in
there
main
brief
but
then
they
have
five
briefs
that
is
the
standard.
now,
let
me
direct
--
let
me
invite
the
court’s
attention
if
i
may
to
the
record
here.
there’s
some
confusion,
i
don’t
know
how
to
define
it.
i
don’t
know
how
the
court
can
be
other
than
confused
about
the
record
in
the
case
here.
may
i
direct
your
attention
to
--
i
invite
your
attention
to
the
page
3
of
the
main
government
brief
first.
this
is
what
the
attorney
general’s
affidavit
said
about
documents
that
after
they
say
that
the
wiretap
is
applied
to
purpose
i‘ve
stated
and
then
paragraph
4,
submitted
with
this
affidavit
is
a
sealed
exhibit
containing
one,
the
records
of
intercepted
conversations;
two,
a
description
and
let
me
explain
that
the
lower
court,
let
me
be
sure
that
you
understand
that
lower
court
direction
here
is
only
that
the
plamondon
conversation
be
disclosed,
nothing
else,
just
a
plamondon
which
the
government
says
was
fortuitous,
he
dialed
the
wrong
a
number,
two,
a
description
of
the
premises
that
were
the
subject
of
the
surveillances;
and
three,
copies
of
the
memorandum
reflecting
the
attorney
general’s
expressed
approval
of
the
installation
of
the
surveillances.
now,
next
up
let
me
suggest
that
we
go
page
9
of
the
government’s
reply
brief.
they
broaden
the
scope
there
a
bit,
they
say,
“respondent
district
judge
urges
that
it
complains
about
the
standard
employed
here
and
that
we
can
make
the
point
that
they
haven’t
complied
with
the
standard”
which
we
certainly
do.
now,
i’ll
come
back
to
that,
the
affidavit
however,
says
the
government
was
not
authorization
to
the
surveillance
in
response
to
defendant’s
motion
under
rule
16,
affidavit
was
prepared
and
transmitted
to
the
court
together
with
the
in
camera
submission.
this
submission
contains:
(1)
the
signed
authorization
of
the
attorney
general.
(2)
documents
characterizing
the
illegal
activities
and
names
of
the
authorization
in
question
including
information
relating
to
the
means
by
which
it
intended
to
achieve
its
aims.
(3)
a
summary
inventory
of
prior
monitored
conversations.
(4)
a
document
relating
to
the
previous
authorization
of
the
prior
attorney
general.
(5)
a
description
of
the
in
premises
involved
in
all
overhearings
of
the
defendant
respondent
plamondon.
those
documents
and
not
the
affidavit
are
the
proper
basis
for
determining
the
ground
of
upon
which
the
attorney
general
acted.
third,
let
us
go
to
page
30
of
the
government’s
main
brief
if
we
--
if
i
may.
there's
a
footnote
there
after
footnote
13
on
page
30,
defendant
plamondon
was
not
the
subject
and
so
forth.
the
next
paragraph,
we
obliged
with
the
clerk
of
this
court
for
it’s
in
camera
consideration
the
same
exhibit
we
submitted
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
ferguson
case.
this
was
aaddressed
to
this
court
which
involves
the
same
issue
as
the
present
case
and
is
now
pending
in
the
petition
through
for
a
writ
of
certiorari.
now,
that
sentence
ought
to
be
read
as
carefully
as
it
was
written.
it
does
not
say
that
the
material
in
the
exhibit
was
in
the
record
of
the
ninth
circuit
case.
the
fact
is
that
it
is
not
in
the
record
of
the
ninth
circuit
case.
it
was
submitted
to
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
ninth
circuit
we
understand
we
are
lively
informed
by
former
deputy
attorney
general
who
represented
judge
ferguson
out
there
that
that
material
was
submitted
by
the
government.
they
where
requested
to
make
a
motion.
they
made
a
motion.
the
motion
has
not
been
decided.
so
that
material
to
which
the
government
--
on
which
the
government
says
that
is
relies
for
the
authority,
the
attorney
general
for
the
considerations
that
motivated
the
attorney
general.
not
in
the
record
of
this
case.
was
not
in
the
record
of
the
sixth
circuit
and
not
in
the
record
of
the
ninth
circuit.
so
how
does
it
become
material?
it's
not
available
to
us
and
let
me
point
out
that
on
page
8
of
the
reply
brief
of
the
government.
they
make
some
vague
statements.
they
have
always
taken
the
position.
they
took
the
position
in
the
--
in
their
affidavit,
in
their
memorandum
of
law
in
opposition
to
the
motion
to
suppress
to
the
lower
court.
they
took
the
position
in
the
court
of
appeals.
and
they
took
the
position
in
there
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
in
this
case
that
the
issue
here
was
one
of
domestic
security,
domestic
surveillance,
domestic
organizations.
now,
they
say
and
this
is
as
far
as
they
go
and
this
is
as
much
as
they
say
on
page
8,
the
fact
that
an
organization
is
domestic
does
not
mean
that
its
activities
cannot
involve
foreign
intelligence
operations.
a
domestic
organization
for
example,
may
have
a
large
number
of
significant
foreign
contacts
in
association
that
may
influence,
may
have
a
large
number,
and
may
influence
or
they
even
call
these
domestic
activities.
similarly,
individuals
connect
with
the
domestic
organization
themselves
may
have
such
foreign
ties
and
then
they
go
on
to
say,
it’s
a
practical
impossibility
to
find
the
distinctions
such
as
organization
unless
one
uses
the
principle
of
geographic
size
and
so
on.
the
district
court
did
not
consider
this
problem
but
granted
decision
on
the
fact
that
the
organization
is
distinguished
from
the
intelligence
sought
was
wholly
domestic.
the
point
is
that,
the
argument
was
not
made
before
the
district
court.
it
was
not
made
in
the
court
of
appeals.
it
is
not
made
in
the
writ
of
certiorari
to
this
case
that
--
and
there
--
and
that
there
is
no
assertion
now
in
any
document,
not
even
in
this
reply
brief
that
this
organization,
this
“domestic
organization”
it
has
foreign
ties
or
is
influenced
by
foreigners.
there's
no
such
statement
and
so,
i
do
not
know
how
this
court
can
base
its
decision
in
this
case
on
adequacy
to
papers
on
any
such
record.
now
if
i
may,
i
want
to
read
the
rest
of
the
affidavit,
the
rest
of
the
footnote
on
page
30
and
31
starting
at
the
bottom
at
the
bottom
of
page
30.
we
think
these
records
demonstrates
that
any
characterization
of
the
organization
in
question
is
domestic,
is
in
the
court
of
--
mr.
william
t.
gossett
the
--
it’s
the
main
brief
of
the
government,
page
30
and
the
footnote,
last
paragraph
of
the
footnote
beginning
on
page
30,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
think
these
records
demonstrate
at
any
characterization
of
the
organization
in
question
is
domestic
is
unsupportable.
for
example,
over
a
14
month-period,
521
telephone
calls
were
made
from
this
installation,
the
foreign
and
overseas
installations
and
another
430
calls,
the
contents
of
which
deal
with
foreign
subject
matter
replaced
to
domestic
installations.
now,
that’s
a
sole
basis
for
the
government’s
claim
for
that
--
there’s
any
foreign
intelligence
involves
here.
and
i
--
who
characterized
that,
it
says
any
characterization
of
the
organization
as
domestic.
who
characterized
this
as
domestic?
why,
it's
perfectly
clear
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
characterizes
it
as
domestic
and
he
is
never
in
any
paper
stated
otherwise,
stated
facts
that
are
available
to
us
as
a
basis
for
any
other
characterization.
mr.
william
t.
gossett
well,
i
think
that
it
would
then
depend
on
the
facts
and
circumstances
and
i
think
that’s
the
very
purpose
of
the
warrant
requirement
to
set
up
those
facts
and
circumstances,
have
counsel
explain
to
the
court
what
the
significance
with
other
relations
as
where
and
have
the
court
perform
its
constitutional
role
to
determine
whether
the
--
an
intrusion
is
proper,
what
to
do
extent
of
the
intrusion
and
so
on,
all
the
requirements
whether
they're
probable
cause
for
the
intrusion.
mr.
william
t.
gossett
this
court
has
reserved
expressly
the
matter
of
the
power
of
the
president
in
the
foreign
field.
we
don’t
have
it
involved
here.
i
think
the
president
perhaps
has
extraordinary
powers
in
the
foreign
field
but
even
there,
let
me
make
a
point
if
i
may.
if
i
could
ask
you
to
turn
to
our
brief,
page
--
in
the
appendix
of
our
briefs.
we
set
out
there
section
2511
(3)
whereas
consists
in
the
appendix
of
the
blue
covered
brief,
we
submit.
its
from
the
omnibus
crime
and
safe
streets
act
of
1968,
2511
this
language
was
obviously
very
carefully
drawn
and
it
appears
in
a
statute
that
is
very
carefully
drawn
that
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
this
country
abides
for
electronic
surveillance
with
the
court
order
and
provides
that
in
case
of
national
security
searchers
and
seizures,
that
the
government
may
proceed
without
a
court
order
provided
that
within
48
hours
after
the
surveillance
starts
they
get
a
court
order
or
apply
for
court
order.
that’s
the
expressed
provision
of
congress
with
respect
to
national
security
cases.
now
2511
(3)
nothing
contain
in
this
chapter
or
in
section
605,
the
communications
act
of
1934.
now,
we
deal
first
i
think
with
the
foreign
power,
shall
limit
the
constitutional
power
of
the
president
to
take
such
measures
as
he
deemed
necessary
to
protect
the
nation
against
actual
or
potential
attack
or
other
hostile
acts
of
a
foreign
power
to
obtain
foreign
intelligence
information
deemed
essential
to
the
security
of
the
united
states
or
to
protect
national
security
information
against
foreign
intelligence
activities.
three
times
that
use
foreign,
the
word
foreign,
foreign
power,
foreign
intelligence
information.
now,
the
next
sentence
i
think
deals
with
the
domestic
side,
nor
shall
anything
contain
in
this
chapter
be
deemed
to
limit
the
constitutional
power
of
the
president,
to
take
such
measures
as
he
deems
necessary
same
language,
to
protect
the
united
states
against
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
or
other
unlawful
means
or
against
any
other
clear
and
present
danger
to
the
structure
or
the
existence
of
the
government.
now,
why
i
didn’t
we
--
quite
aside
from
the
facts
that
are
not
available
to
us?
why
could
not
the
government
of
the
united
states
follow
the
prescribed
languages
with
respect
to
domestic
activities?
the
word
“intelligence”
is
not
used
but
the
word
“force”
and
the
words
“unlawful
action”
and
“clear
and
present
danger.”
none
of
those
words
are
used,
have
been
used
not
only
in
the
affidavit
have
been
use
any
document
in
this
case.
mr.
william
t.
gossett
i
think
if
they
were
employed
by
the
foreigners,
they
might
be
part
of
a
foreign
operation.
but
let
me
--
mr.
william
t.
gossett
i
think
so.
i
think
so
and
the
--
wherein
the
doctrine,
mr.
chief
justice
about
the
facts,
all
we
know
is
that
the
fact
--
that
the
attorney
general
said
and
said
to
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
this
is
a
domestic
organization,
nothing
about
foreign
activities
and
the
most
i
have
said
is
that
foreign
activities
may
be
involved.
that
in
the
domestic
organization
not
this
one
but
in
domestic
organization,
foreign
activities
may
be
involved.
may
i
just
read,
i
call
your
attention
to
the
last
sentence
and
that’s
very
carefully
drawn
paragraph.
mr.
william
t.
gossett
i'm
still
on
the
appendix.
yes,
on
2511
(3).
the
contents
of
any
wire
or
oral
communication
intercepted
by
authority
of
the
president,
this
was
read
by
mr.
mardian,
right.
i
read
it
differently
than
he
does.
i
see
significance
in
it
that
he
did
not
point
out.
in
the
exercise
the
foregoing
powers
may
be
received
in
evidence
in
any
trial
hearing
or
other
proceedings
only
where
such
interception
was
reasonable.
now,
and
shall
not
be
otherwise
be
use
to
disclose
except
if
it
is
necessary
to
implement
that
power.
what
does
reasonable
mean?
well,
the
committee
reports
are
quite
clear
on
this
subject.
they
interpret
reasonable
just
as
this
court
interpreted
in
camara
and
in
katz
and
in
berger.
they
say
reasonable
the
test
reasonable
is
a
standard
reasonableness
shall
be
the
probable
cause
test
under
the
fourth
amendment.
they
make
it
very
clear.
so
when
they
use
this
--
the
congress
used
this
language
they
meant
that
in
a
domestic
situation
if
the
government
expected
to
use
the
evidence
--
the
fruits
of
the
electronic
surveillance
in
evidence
then
they
must
--
it
must
be
reasonably
obtained
and
that
means
under
the
fourth
amendment
probable
cause
test.
they
say,
the
government
says
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
prohibit
all
searches
and
seizures
without
warrant
but
only
unreasonable
ones.
the
test
for
determining
reasonable
as
they
say
is
to
weigh
the
competing
interest
involved
and
they
then
purport
the
balance
of
competing
interest.
and
they
say,
they
find
naturally,
that
the
government
interest
in
protecting
national
security,
the
physical
security
of
this
country
had
ways
the
invasion
of
personal
rights
result
--
resulting
from
the
surveillance.
of
course,
it
ignores
the
essential
second
step
in
the
procedure
and
as
i
say
there
is
unfair
weighing
if
they
are
weighing
the
national
security
against
the
rights
of
these
three
defendants.
but
determination
of
whether
search
is
unreasonable
involved
more
than
a
weighing
of
the
competing
interest,
the
process
must
begin
with
to
quote
this
court
in
camara,
i
never
known
that
correct
pronunciation,
i
hope
it’s
camara.
one
governing
principles
justified
by
history
by
current
experience
that
is
consistently
been
followed
that
except
and
certainly
carefully
defined
classes
of
cases
of
search
of
private
property
without
proper
consent
is
unreasonable
unless
it
had
been
authorized
by
a
valid
search
warrant.
the
warrant
procurement
is
not
merely
one
method
of
assuring
reasonable
search,
it
is
crucial
and
it
is
generally
indispensable.
probable
cause
set
in
the
court
in
camara
is
the
standard
by
which
the
constitutional
mandate
a
reasonable
as
it
is
tested
and
the
burden,
the
burden
is
on
those
seeking
an
exemption
from
warrant
requirement
the
show
a
need
for
it.
not
just
a
need
to
search
but
the
need
the
search
without
a
warrant.
now,
of
course
there’s
a
governmental
interests
who
would
dispute.
there's
a
governmental
interests
in
protecting
the
fabric
of
society
so
as
the
government
puts
in
his
brief.
but
that’s
not
the
interests
as
take
in
this
case.
in
camara,
as
you
recall
and
that
almost
identical
argument
was
made
in
principle,
“that
the
general
health
and
safety
of
the
entire
urban
population
is
dependent
upon
enforcement
of
minimum
fire
housing
and
sanitation
standard.”
then,
thus
it
was
claim
at
required
systematized
inspection
of
all
physical
structures
about
a
warrant.
but
as
this
court
noted
the
argument
missed
the
mark.
the
question
knows
not
whether
these
inspections
may
be
made
but
whether
they
may
be
made
without
a
warrant
and
so
it
is
in
this
case.
but
the
warrant
procurement
is
no
mere
formality.
we
agree
with
the
attorney
general
that
the
president
is
responsible
for
ensuring
our
system
of
government
as
a
viable
entity.
indeed
his
duty
is
even
greater
than
that,
greater
and
more
formidable.
he
sworn
not
to
protect
the
government
as
such
but
to
preserve,
protect,
and
defend
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
but
his
powers
must
be
exercise
and
the
need
for
information
satisfied
to
a
constitutionally
proper
means.
and
the
constitution
limits
the
president
even
in
his
most
awesome
responsibilities
that
this
court
has
held
in
a
number
of
cases
and
that
we
don’t
subscribe
to
the
inherent
power
of
argument,
the
government
made
it
in
the
lower
court
and
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
would
do
formatting
its
main
brief
in
this
case
and
now
it
seems
to
back
to
the
inherent
power
of
argument.
we
think
--
mr.
william
t.
gossett
i
think
the
fourth
amendment
contemplates
and
provided
for
judicial
process
mr.
justice.
i
don’t
think
that
would
be
judicial
process.
i
think
that
what
the
government
--
what
the
generations
of
americans
were
talking
about
formulated
the
fourth
amendment
was
a
neutral
magistrate,
a
detached
magistrate
and
the
president
is
a
political
man
and
i
don’t
think,
and
so
is
the
department
of
justice,
(inaudible)
work
for
him.
they're
politicians
and
they
should
not
be
given
the
power
to
determine
how
much
and
how
long
and
how
great
will
be
the
intrusion
of
private
citizens
in
this
country.
and
that’s
what
the
government
is
arguing
for
in
this
case.
mr.
william
t.
gossett
i
think
so.
mr.
william
t.
gossett
i
think
it
does
not.
mr.
william
t.
gossett
that’s
right.
i
may
trust
this
administration.
i'm
talking
about
a
long
over
period.
mr.
william
t.
gossett
this
is
court
has
so
held.
mr.
william
t.
gossett
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
t.
gossett
i
would
indeed
accept
that
i
think
congress
has
a
power
to
set
up
standards
from
which
the
--
mr.
william
t.
gossett
could
not
pass
upon
the
standards
that’s
asked
upon
the
facts,
i
agree.
yes,
sir
--
mr.
william
t.
gossett
yes.
that’s
our
position
and
of
course
they
have
set
up
standards
in
the
1968
act
and
i
think
that
act
has
gone
a
long
way
to
solve
some
of
the
problems
here.
and
the
act
deals
with
such
crimes
as
espionage,
sabotage,
presidential
assassination,
treason,
all
of
these
things
that
the
government
says
are
unsafe
for
the
courts
to
deal
with.
they're
too
complicated.
they
can’t
deal
with
these
matters
but
they
must
be
dealt
with
the
by
executive
and
is
--
in
his
great
--
with
his
great
wisdom
and
knowledge
and
background
on
this
matter.
they
must
be
dealt
with
by
the
executive.(voice
overlap)
well
are
you
--
are
you
arguing
mr.
gossett
that’s
whatever
the
scope
of
inherent
power
prior
to
the
1968
act.
if
the
1968
act
has
now
spoken
to
this
subject
and
controls,
is
that
your
argument?
mr.
william
t.
gossett
so
far
as
congress
is
concern,
it
does,
it
has.
i
think
congress
has
left
open
a
