mr.
ernest
j.
brown
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case,
on
certiorari
to
the
tenth
circuit.
brings
to
the
court
for
the
first
time
since
it
was
enacted
as
part
of
the
revenue
act
of
1928,
what
is
now
section
482
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
that
provision
is
as
follows.
in
any
case
of
two
or
more
organizations,
trades
or
businesses
owned
or
controlled
directly
or
indirectly
by
the
same
entities,
the
secretary
office
delegates,
the
commissioner
as
i
phrase
it,
to
distribute
a
portion
or
allocate
gross
income,
deductions,
credits
or
allowances
between
or
among
such
organizations,
trades
or
businesses
if
he
determines
that
such
distribution,
apportionment
or
allocation
is
necessary
in
order
to
prevent
evasion
of
taxes
or
clearly
to
reflect
the
income
of
any
such
organizations,
trades
or
businesses.
this
provision
of
course
expresses
the
judgment
that
autonomous
business
units
will
exercise
self
interest
and
bargaining
power
which
will
cause
income
and
outlays
to
reflect
the
performance
or
function
and
the
acquisition
of
benefits
in
accordance
with
the
values
of
the
market.
but
on
the
other
hand,
when
we
have
units
under
common
control,
a
host
of
factors
which
may
or
may
not
include
tax
considerations,
may
distort
this
picture
and
cause
considerable
divergence
between
income,
expenditures
on
the
one
hand
and
performance
or
function
or
the
acquisition
of
benefits
on
the
other.
so
that
the
regulations
have
always
provided
since
--
as
they
provide
now
since
1934
that
the
authority
given
account
is
not
solely
or
even
necessarily
primarily
to
cases
of
improper
accounting
or
fraudulent,
colorable
or
sham
transactions
or
a
device
designed
to
evade
or
avoid
taxes,
but
the
authority
extends
to
any
case
in
which
by
inadvertence
or
design,
taxable
income,
in
whole
or
in
part
of
the
controlled
tax
payer
is
other
than
it
would
have
been
had
the
taxpayer
in
the
conduct
vist
to
ask,
been
an
uncontrolled
taxpayer,
dealing
at
arm's
length
with
another
uncontrolled
taxpayer.
to
bring
performance
or
function
and
taxable
income
into
life
to
create
what
some
courts
have
referred
as
economic
reality,
the
commissioner
may
and
often
has
found
it
necessary
to
analyze
pricing,
charges,
of
their
services,
distribution
of
receipts
or
the
bearing
of
burdens
of
expenditures.
in
this
case,
the
commissioner
found
it
necessary
to
allocate
to
the
taxpayer
banks
a
substantial
part,
some
40%
of
the
premium
income
received
by
a
--
like
insurance
company
under
common
control
for
the
years
1954
through
1959.
his
allocation
was
upheld
by
the
tax
court,
relying
on
its
previous
review
decision
in
local
finance
corporation,
a
decision
which
thereafter
had
been
affirmed
by
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals.
in
the
local
finance
corporation
decision,
the
tax
court
had
reviewed
extensive
and
reference
was
made
in
this
case
in
the
tax
court
to
those
findings,
had
reviewed
extensively
the
nature
and
customs
of
the
business
of
credit
insurance
which
is
much
involved
here.
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
however,
reversed
the
tax
court,
disagreeing
with
the
seventh
circuit
in
local
finance.
because
of
this
conflict
and
because
the
significance
of
section
482
increases
as
business
aggregates
grow
not
only
larger,
but
more
varied
in
their
nature,
we
have
more
and
more
cases
where
a
business
aggregate
includes
corporations
that
are
subject
to
methods
of
taxation
other
than
the
normal,
barring
the
corporations,
western
hemisphere
trade
corporations
and
life
insurance
companies
as
in
this
case.
for
those
reasons,
the
government
sought
certiorari
which
this
court
granted.
the
facts
giving
rise
to
the
controversy
are
as
follows.
the
taxpayers
are
two
national
banks;
first
security
bank
of
utah
and
first
security
bank
of
idaho.
they
are
holding
on
subsidiaries
of
first
security
corporation,
a
publicly
owned
holding
company,
which
owns
a
number
of
other
corporations
as
well,
including
first
security
company
or
management
company
which
i
would
refer
as
management
company
to
avoid
confusion,
smith
and
sons,
an
insurance
agency
and
beginning
in
1954,
first
security
life,
an
insurance
company
incorporated
in
that
year
which
is
a
--
that
one
is
prime
activist
in
this
case.
we
should
go
back
to
1948
at
the
opposite.
beginning
then
and
since
that
time,
the
banks
have
offered
to
their
borrowers,
credit
life
insurance.
this
is
diminishing
term,
life
insurance
under
which
in
case
of
the
death
of
the
borrower,
his
death
will
be
paid
to
the
creditor.
the
premium
charged
throughout
en
banc
all
here
are
concerned
was
$1.00,
per
hundred
per
year.
this
has
been
the
usual
and
standard
right
in
the
industry.
this
premium,
though
apparently
it
sounds
small,
permits
generous
commissions
to
be
paid
to
the
person
who
sells
the
insurance.
it
has
been
customary
in
the
industry
to
pay
commissions
in
the
neighborhood
of
50%
of
the
premiums.
mr.
ernest
j.
brown
yes,
your
honor.
they
are
often
paid
in
advance.
this
is
usually
measured
by
the
time
of
the
death.
if
the
death
is
said
to
be
repaid
in
three
years,
then
a
single
premium
will
be
collected
at
the
outset
to
cover
the
three-year
death.
so
that
the
--
mr.
ernest
j.
brown
50%
of
the
premium,
yes.
it
is
possible
and
in
many
cases
it
happens
that
a
credit
life
insurance
company
will
issue
a
policy
directly
to
the
borrower
and
he
will
be
the
policy
holder
in
holding.
however,
in
these
cases
or
in
this
case
as
demonstrated
by
the
exhibits
in
the
record,
the
banks
followed
another
procedure.
they
took
out
group
life
insurance
policies,
beginning
1948
or
each
bank
took
out
a
group
life
insurance
policy,
covering
the
lives
of
their
borrowers
who
qualify.
in
1948,
this
was
with
the
credit
life
insurance
company
of
ohio.
in
1953,
this
was
changed
to
another
group
policy
with
the
american
banker's
life
insurance
company
of
florida.
so
that
the
procedure
that
was
followed
was
when
a
borrower
came
to
the
bank,
his
loan
was
approved.
the
loan
officer,
we
are
told
made
available,
informed
him
or
offered,
the
record
of
course
does
not
repeat
the
conversations,
but
hard
selling
and
the
soft
selling
and
then
this
interest
in
selling,
both
sides
were
interested
and
we
do
not
suggest
that
it
makes
a
difference
whether
this
was
pressed
or
not.
in
any
event,
credit
life
insurance
was
offered
or
made
available
to
the
borrower,
as
necessary,
it
was
explained
to
him,
ultimately
it
is
desired.
if
he
was
interested,
he
was
given
by
the
bank
an
application
form
to
fill
out.
there
are
copies
in
the
record,
they
are
relatively
simple.
the
qualifications
are,
minute,
you
have
to
be
under
65
and
yes,
some
other
minor
matters,
but
this
is
a
sample
form,
the
borrower
interested
filled
it
out.
it
was
then
examined
by
a
bank
employee
and
if
satisfactory,
the
premium
was
collected
or
added
to
the
amount
of
his
loan.
the
bank
employee
then
made
out
and
delivered
to
the
borrower
a
certificate
of
insurance
and
there
are
copies
of
those
in
the
record.
well,
they
are
numbered
exhibits
and
i
assume
that
they
can
be
accepted.
it
is
another
very
simple
document.
it
is
important
i
think
that
at
this
time
the
insurance
was
effective.
if
the
borrower
had
been
killed
in
traffic
on
the
way
home
from
the
bank,
he
was
insured.
his
loan
would
be
paid
off.
the
insurance
companies
which
issued
these
group
policies
to
the
banks
received
the
commissions,
well,
i
should
go
back
a
step.
when
the
bank
had
issued
this
certificate
to
the
borrower,
it
turned
over
the
premium
and
the
papers
involved
to
the
management
company
which
made
appropriate
records
and
then
forwarded
the
premium
and
the
appropriate
records
to
the
insurance
company.
the
insurance
company,
both
credit
life
of
ohio
and
american
bankers
of
florida
remitted
generous
commissions
varying
from
--
between
1948
and
1954,
from
40
to
55
%
of
the
premiums
involved.
these
were
paid
to
smith
and
sons,
the
insurance
agent
subsidiary
though
it
had
nothing
to
do
at
all
with
either
selling
or
perfecting
the
insurance
that
had
been
done
by
the
bank
and
their
employees.
oddly
enough
and
for
reasons
which
an
executive
vice
president
of
treasury
of
the
management
company
testified,
he
could
not
recall.
these
commissions
were
not
included
in
the
taxable
income
of
the
insurance
agency
or
of
the
bank,
but
of
the
management
company
and
the
testimony
as
i
say
just
a
blank,
the
vice
president
of
the
treasury
said
i
just
cannot
remember
why
it
was
done
that
way.
in
any
event
this
was
the
procedure
that
went
on
from
1948,
until
1954.
late
in
1953
the
american
national
insurance
company
of
texas
approached
the
holding
company
with
a
new
plan,
a
slight
variant
on
the
o.
it
had
noticed
--
mr.
ernest
j.
brown
certainly
your
honor.
mr.
ernest
j.
brown
well,
there
was
no
insurance
company
at
that
time
your
honor.
the
insurance
company
is
formed
and
comes
into
being
in
1954.
mr.
ernest
j.
brown
your
honor,
these
were
all
the
same
rates.
as
you
know
there
is
very
little
graduation
in
corporate
rates.
the
banks,
the
management
company
and
the
insurance
agency,
none
as
a
loss
corporation
in
that
way
so
that
--
i
suppose
except
for
a
purist,
it
made
no
great
difference.
there
was
no
revenue
difference
necessary
that
might
have
been.
i
cannot
say
because
i
have
not
the
returns
before
me
that
for
all
those
six
years
the
--
all
of
the
corporations
possibly
involved
were
in
the
roughly
50%
bracket
rather
than
in
the
roughly
22%
bracket.
but
we
will
accept
these
were
prosperous
corporations
and
i
think
it
is
highly
probable
that
it
may
be.
if
the
management
--
mr.
ernest
j.
brown
if
the
management
company
was
in
a
lower
bracket
to
we
are
making
no
point
of
it
as
you
suggest.
these
as
opposed
to
an
insurance
company
or
corporations
which
are
taxed
all
in
the
same
manner,
regular
purposes.
mr.
ernest
j.
brown
yes,
well,
i
can
tell
you
that.
now
the
management
company
had
no
function
at
all.
it
just
copied
and
made
copies
and
forwarded
to
the
--
mr.
ernest
j.
brown
no.
that
is
not
correct,
justice
white.
the
employees
of
the
bank
were
the
ones
who
filled
out.
the
--
who
supervised
--
mr.
ernest
j.
brown
for
transmission,
for
making
their
own
records
and
transmitting
to
the
insurance
company.
mr.
ernest
j.
brown
it
made
records,
your
honor.
it
was
an
accounting
company
but
all
of
the
contact
with
the
costumers,
the
filling
out
of
applications,
delivery
of
the
certificate
was
by
bank
employees
with
the
company.
now,
there
is
no
alternative
allocation
to
the
management
company.
that
is
not
before
the
court
of
course
in
this
case
and
in
case
that
should
be
remanded.
i
would
be
embarrassed
if
i
stood
and
then
cut
the
ground
from
under
the
commissioner,
but
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
i
have
not
considered
the
management
company
and
it
seems
to
have
been
largely
a
transmittal
tower,
keeping
its
zone.
they
didn't
have
xerox
machines,
but
if
they
ran
these
through
the
xerox
machine
and
sent
them
on,
where
i
suppose
the
function
would
then
perform.
in
any
event,
in
1953,
the
american
national
company
came
in
with
a
new
plan.
it
proposed
that
it'd
be
the
prime
underwriter
on
the
credit
life
insurance.
however,
that
the
holding
company
form
a
subsidiary
and
that
that
subsidiary
re-insure
all
these
risks,
american
national
had
noted
that
financial
institutions
were
forming
their
own
subsidiary
or
affiliate
insurance
companies
and
the
record
indicates
it
were
not
the
key
part
of
business,
it
could.
so,
it
suggested
that
for
8
(b),
it
would
supply
accounting
services,
some
record
keeping,
the
insurance
company
record
keeping,
actuarial
services.
the
staff
like
of
an
insurance
company,
but
this
would
be
for
8
(b),
and
then
it
would
re-insure
all
this
risks
with
this
subsidiary
to
be
formed
so
that
the
risk
was
then
shifted.
mr.
ernest
j.
brown
well,
i
suppose
the
lawyers
did
the
drafting
of
the
documents,
your
honor
but
--
mr.
ernest
j.
brown
no,
no,
no.
the
--
well,
we
are
told
by
the
record
that
this
was
in
fact
done
by
most
of
the
--
by
american
national.
the
findings
are
that
other
than
the
payment
of
loses,
that
bank
charges
and
taxes
that
the
newly
formed
reinsurance
company
had
little
in
the
way
of
expenses.
indeed
the
findings
of
the
tax
court
which
set
out
the
expenses
had
showed
a
very
minute
figure
there.
so
it
was,
i
think
i
do
not
exaggerate
if
i
say
it
was
largely
passive.
it
had
investment
problems
of
course,
but
it
had
substantial
funds.
mr.
ernest
j.
brown
the
comptroller
has
come,
we
are
coming
justice
douglas
to
the
question
of
the
authority
of
banks
to
participate.
the
comptroller
has
taken
the
position
that
a
bank
may
as
an
incident
to
its
lending
function,
handle
insurance
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
saxon
case
which
is
cited
in
both
briefs
held
that
this
was
improper
and
invalidated
the
ruling
of
the
comptroller
and
enjoined
the
banks
from
participating
in
the
selling
of
insurance.
mr.
ernest
j.
brown
no
your
honor,
this
is
very
peculiar.
the
statute;
we
have
no
statute
at
all
that
does
anything.
there
is
this
1916
statute
which
says
that
national
banks
in
a
small
town
may
be
insurance
agents.
now
the
comptroller
says,
well
that
is
general
business.
he
does
not
care
that
the
banks
can
be
on
the
general,
but
that
they
can
assist
their
lending
functions.
the
taxpayers
and
perhaps
properly,
i
do
not
think
we
have
to
ask
the
court
for
a
decision
on
that
banking
question,
the
taxpayers
read
that
statute
or
part
of
that
statute
because
this
is
one
of
the
curious
aspects
as
though
it
said
banks
in
small
towns
and
only
banks
in
small
towns,
they
do
the
following
things.
they
have
been
stressed
the
thing,
the
section
that
says,
banks
may
receive
commissions.
they
do
not
mention
the
fact
that
the
statute
also
says
that
banks
may
collect
premiums
and
sell
insurance
in
that
generally.
the
banks
in
this
case
fairly
effectuated
the
insurance.
however,
this
was
put
into
operation.
security
life
was
formed
with
a
capital
of
25,000,
paid
in
surplus
of
12,500;
37,500
in
net
worth.
at
the
end
of
the
year,
it
was
re-insuring
risks
of
over
6
million.
at
the
end
of
1959,
it
was
re-insuring
risks
of
over
41
million.
mr.
ernest
j.
brown
your
honors
as
i
was
pointing
out,
beginning
in
1954
the
banks
remitted
premiums
to
american
national.
it
kept
some
13.5
%
of
those
premiums
for
its
fees.
the
remaining
86.5
were
remitted
to
security
life.
this
business
was
very
profitable
for
security
life
with
a
net
worth
of
$37,500.00
at
the
outset
in
1954.
by
the
end
of
1959
it
had
a
net
worth
of
$850,000.00
and
it
paid
a
$389,000.00
dividend
so
in
five
years
with
a
capitalization
on
original
net
worth
of
$37,500.00,
it
had
profits
after
reserves
and
after
expenses
of
a
$1,200,000.00.
the
commissioner
allocated
40%
of
the
premiums
then
to
the
banks
on
the
theory
that
the
banks
had
performed
the
services
which
resulted
in
the
insurance.
they
had
effectuated
the
insurance
and
that
the
market
demonstrated
that
commissions
of
a
minimum
40%
were
allocable.
on
these
facts
it
would
be
very
difficult
even
to,
i
think
to
raise
a
substantial
question,
but
the
facts
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
ernest
j.
brown
well,
that
is
the
next
question
mr.
chief
justice.
the
taxpayers
make
the
point
that
and
they
have
repeated
frequently
in
their
briefs
that
the
banks
could
not
receive
these
commissions.
and
as
i
was
pointing
out
in
answer
to
justice
douglas’
question,
justice
white
suggested,
this
is
considerably
more
complicated
than
that.
the
only
statute
is
when
it
permits
banks
in
small
towns
to
engage
in
general
insurance
agents.
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
believes
and
has
ruled
that
this
type
of
transaction
is
perfectly
proper
for
banks.
however,
the
fifth
circuit
has
enjoined
banks
from
participating
in
just
this
type
of
transaction.
it
is
interesting
that
the
fifth
circuit
and
there
is
a
substantial
question
of
standing
as
the
suit
was
brought
by
insurance
agents,
the
fifth
circuit
ruled,
surveying
a
fairly
lengthy
statutory
history
and
more
of
what
congress
had
failed
to
do
than
what
it
had
done
that
there
was
an
inhibition
on
the
banks
and
that
this
was
to
protect
insurance
agencies
to
avoid
competition
by
banks
with
insurance
agents.
well,
i
think
it
is
clear
that
what
the
banks
did
here
ousted
an
insurance
agents
of
a
substantial
business.
it
is
not
our
point
either
to
exonerate
or
indict
the
banks
for
what
they
did,
but
only
to
describe
what
they
did.
so
even
if
you
take
the
statute
as
i
suggested
earlier
that
authorizes
small
town
banks
to
act
as
agents
to
sell
insurance,
to
collect
premiums
and
then
to
receive
commissions,
it
seems
to
me
a
peculiarly
narrow
reading
to
focus
only
on
the
receiving
commissions.
the
banks
effectuated
this
insurance
and
it
is
not
for
me
to
say
whether
they
were
insurance
--
mr.
ernest
j.
brown
yes
sir.
mr.
ernest
j.
brown
and
that
is
what
--
on
any
ground
whether,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
correct.
mr.
ernest
j.
brown
no
your
honor,
i
think
not.
i
think
under
--
if
we
had
been
involved
in
the
years
before
1954,
we
would
have.
as
judge
friendly
pointed
out,
1961,
this
court's
decision
in
lucas
and
earl,
chicago
and
joliet
railroad,
is
as
he
said,
a
blunt
instrument.
usually
that
is
an
all
or
nothing.
now,
we
would
not
claim
that
all
the
payments
to
the
life
insurance
company
were
income
to
the
banks
because
the
life
insurance
company
did
perform
the
function
of
re-insuring
these
writs.
it
was
a
minimum
capital,
but
it
did
that.
so
here,
482
provides
for
allocation
as
it
often
requires
analysis
of
prices,
of
services.
1961
is
the
blunter
instrument.
judge
friendly’s
opinion
in
the
ruben
(ph)
case
which
is
cited
makes
a
point
of
that.
so
we
would
--
i
do
not
know,
i
shouldn't
say
that
it's
universal,
that
no
court
has
ever
analyzed
a
transaction
and
said
part
of
the
income
was
uncommon
to
lucas
and
earl,
but
482
is
the
more
flexible,
and
more
surgical
instrument
and
it
seems
appropriate
here
that
that
should
be.
it
presumes
that
their
will
be
no
receipts.
it
does
not
ask
the
bank
to
receive
the
money,
but
it
says
the
bank
is
taxable
as
though
it
had.
that
has
been
true
since
lucas
and
earl.
so
that
i
do
not
think
that
makes
any
difference
and
i
would
like
to
demonstrate
this.
i
think
two
simple
cases
would
demonstrate
that
even
if
this
prohibition
on
receipt
were
verbatim
in
the
statute
as
indeed
it
was
in
local
finance,
the
indiana
statute
was
there
quite
explicit,
but
two
simple
cases.
the
first
let
us
take
a
public
office
or
a
purchasing
agent
and
let
us
make
it
federal
since
it
is
a
federal
statute,
and
some
point
it
is
made
of
that.
he
is
prohibited
by
a
statute,
we
will
say,
from
receiving
any
funds
or
moneys
from
any
person
with
whom
he
deals,
a
person
deals
with
his
office
customarily
and
would
like
more
business
than
he
has
been
to
get,
approaches
him
and
offers
him
a
substantial
sum
of
money.
he
says,
i
cannot
take
it,
the
law
prohibits
it
and
then
he
remarks,
i
have
a
son
in
college,
he
could
certainly
use
some
extra
money,
he
is
always
complaining
that
he
does
not
have
enough.
the
visitor
thinks
he
understands
what
has
been
said
and
promptly
they
also
check
to
the
son
in
college
who
inquires
it
is
proven,
and
is
told
to
keep
it.
now,
i
assume
that
it
would
be
no
question,
that
is
income
to
the
father.
let
us
bring
it
a
step
closer
to
this
case,
in
fact
i
would
say
almost
identical
with
this
case.
instead
of
the
son
in
college,
the
purchasing
officer
says,
no
i
cannot
take
your
money
and
the
conversation
goes
on
and
then
he
indicates
he
had
inherited
an
orchard
a
few
years
back
and
he
had
incorporated
it,
his
farms
incorporated
and
they
sell
the
produce.
the
visitor
at
a
little
polite
in
direction
says
he
is
interested
in
inquiring
apples
and
peaches
and
says
i
will
pay
you,
i
will
pay
farms
incorporated
a
price
which
is
obviously
far
above
the
market.
the
price
is
accepted,
farms
incorporated
receives
the
money.
i
think
there
could
be
no
question
that
though
the
statute
prohibits
the
officer
from
receiving
these
funds
that
482
would
allow
the
commissioner
to
allocate
that
money
to
him.
the
fifth
circuit
has
had
no
difficulty
where
purchasing
officers
who
in
such
oblique
fashion
had
funds
paid
to
them
(inaudible).
so
that
seems
to
this
case.
i
cannot
believe
the
statute
is
more.
we
are
not
concern
with
the
legality
or
illegality
of
the
banks
whether
they
skirted
the
edge
of
collegiality
makes
no
difference.
they
performed
a
valuable
economic
function.
the
commissioner
and
the
tax
court
reviewing
him
decided
that
it
was
highly
appropriate
that
the
market
value
of
this
function
be
allocated
to
the
banks.
i
would
like
to
reserve
if
i
may
any
such
remaining
times
i
have
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
ernest
j.
brown
just
a
--
mr.
ernest
j.
brown
i
do
not
have
the
record
justice
brennan
i
am
sorry
i
do
not
know
what
the
figures
are.
there
is
a
substantial
difference
and
it
stands
and
it
is
right
in
saying
that
the
rates
are,
but
there
is
still
a
substantial
difference
in
the
method
of
computation
of
income
taxes
for
insurance
companies
and
others.
i
would
like
to
point
out
briefly
on
the
post
--
this
time
when
it
been
--
the
banks
suggested
they
might
cancel
the
re-insurance.
american
national
said
it
was
then
paying
insurance
to
--
commissions
to
in
its
designated
agency.
but
mr.
anderson
has
referred
to
national
carbide
which
is
rather
interesting
because
there
by
contract
income
was
payable
to
a
parent
corporation
but
it
was
taxed
to
subsidiaries
because
they
are
ended
and
in
this
case
the
adjustments,
the
parent
corporation
is
no
great
hardship.
the
parent
corporation
can
make
any
adjustments.
the
commissioner
will
allow
of
course
corresponding
deductions
to
the
--
mr.
ernest
j.
brown
the
statute
does
not
require
it.
of
course,
identity
requires
common
control
of
50%,
but
in
any
event
the
possibility
of
divorce
i
take
it
cannot
frustrate
the
use
of
482
for
the
years
when
there
is
common
control
--
mr.
ernest
j.
brown
it
--
for
the
years
after
the
divorce,
not
for
the
years
before
which
was
expected
by
the
court.
thank
you.
mr.
ernest
j.
brown
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case,
on
certiorari
to
the
tenth
circuit.
brings
to
the
court
for
the
first
time
since
it
was
enacted
as
part
of
the
revenue
act
of
1928,
what
is
now
section
482
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
that
provision
is
as
follows.
in
any
case
of
two
or
more
organizations,
trades
or
businesses
owned
or
controlled
directly
or
indirectly
by
the
same
entities,
the
secretary
office
delegates,
the
commissioner
as
i
phrase
it,
to
distribute
a
portion
or
allocate
gross
income,
deductions,
credits
or
allowances
between
or
among
such
organizations,
trades
or
businesses
if
he
determines
that
such
distribution,
apportionment
or
allocation
is
necessary
in
order
to
prevent
evasion
of
taxes
or
clearly
to
reflect
the
income
of
any
such
organizations,
trades
or
businesses.
this
provision
of
course
expresses
the
judgment
that
autonomous
business
units
will
exercise
self
interest
and
bargaining
power
which
will
cause
income
and
outlays
to
reflect
the
performance
or
function
and
the
acquisition
of
benefits
in
accordance
with
the
values
of
the
market.
but
on
the
other
hand,
when
we
have
units
under
common
control,
a
host
of
factors
which
may
or
may
not
include
tax
considerations,
may
distort
this
picture
and
cause
considerable
divergence
between
income,
expenditures
on
the
one
hand
and
performance
or
function
or
the
acquisition
of
benefits
on
the
other.
so
that
the
regulations
have
always
provided
since
--
as
they
provide
now
since
1934
that
the
authority
given
account
is
not
solely
or
even
necessarily
primarily
to
cases
of
improper
accounting
or
fraudulent,
colorable
or
sham
transactions
or
a
device
designed
to
evade
or
avoid
taxes,
but
the
authority
extends
to
any
case
in
which
by
inadvertence
or
design,
taxable
income,
in
whole
or
in
part
of
the
controlled
tax
payer
is
other
than
it
would
have
been
had
the
taxpayer
in
the
conduct
vist
to
ask,
been
an
uncontrolled
taxpayer,
dealing
at
arm's
length
with
another
uncontrolled
taxpayer.
to
bring
performance
or
function
and
taxable
income
into
life
to
create
what
some
courts
have
referred
as
economic
reality,
the
commissioner
may
and
often
has
found
it
necessary
to
analyze
pricing,
charges,
of
their
services,
distribution
of
receipts
or
the
bearing
of
burdens
of
expenditures.
in
this
case,
the
commissioner
found
it
necessary
to
allocate
to
the
taxpayer
banks
a
substantial
part,
some
40%
of
the
premium
income
received
by
a
--
like
insurance
company
under
common
control
for
the
years
1954
through
1959.
his
allocation
was
upheld
by
the
tax
court,
relying
on
its
previous
review
decision
in
local
finance
corporation,
a
decision
which
thereafter
had
been
affirmed
by
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals.
in
the
local
finance
corporation
decision,
the
tax
court
had
reviewed
extensive
and
reference
was
made
in
this
case
in
the
tax
court
to
those
findings,
had
reviewed
extensively
the
nature
and
customs
of
the
business
of
credit
insurance
which
is
much
involved
here.
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
however,
reversed
the
tax
court,
disagreeing
with
the
seventh
circuit
in
local
finance.
because
of
this
conflict
and
because
the
significance
of
section
482
increases
as
business
aggregates
grow
not
only
larger,
but
more
varied
in
their
nature,
we
have
more
and
more
cases
where
a
business
aggregate
includes
corporations
that
are
subject
to
methods
of
taxation
other
than
the
normal,
barring
the
corporations,
western
hemisphere
trade
corporations
and
life
insurance
companies
as
in
this
case.
for
those
reasons,
the
government
sought
certiorari
which
this
court
granted.
the
facts
giving
rise
to
the
controversy
are
as
follows.
the
taxpayers
are
two
national
banks;
first
security
bank
of
utah
and
first
security
bank
of
idaho.
they
are
holding
on
subsidiaries
of
first
security
corporation,
a
publicly
owned
holding
company,
which
owns
a
number
of
other
corporations
as
well,
including
first
security
company
or
management
company
which
i
would
refer
as
management
company
to
avoid
confusion,
smith
and
sons,
an
insurance
agency
and
beginning
in
1954,
first
security
life,
an
insurance
company
incorporated
in
that
year
which
is
a
--
that
one
is
prime
activist
in
this
case.
we
should
go
back
to
1948
at
the
opposite.
beginning
then
and
since
that
time,
the
banks
have
offered
to
their
borrowers,
credit
life
insurance.
this
is
diminishing
term,
life
insurance
under
which
in
case
of
the
death
of
the
borrower,
his
death
will
be
paid
to
the
creditor.
the
premium
charged
throughout
en
banc
all
here
are
concerned
was
$1.00,
per
hundred
per
year.
this
has
been
the
usual
and
standard
right
in
the
industry.
this
premium,
though
apparently
it
sounds
small,
permits
generous
commissions
to
be
paid
to
the
person
who
sells
the
insurance.
it
has
been
customary
in
the
industry
to
pay
commissions
in
the
neighborhood
of
50%
of
the
premiums.
mr.
ernest
j.
brown
yes,
your
honor.
they
are
often
paid
in
advance.
this
is
usually
measured
by
the
time
of
the
death.
if
the
death
is
said
to
be
repaid
in
three
years,
then
a
single
premium
will
be
collected
at
the
outset
to
cover
the
three-year
death.
so
that
the
--
mr.
ernest
j.
brown
50%
of
the
premium,
yes.
it
is
possible
and
in
many
cases
it
happens
that
a
credit
life
insurance
company
will
issue
a
policy
directly
to
the
borrower
and
he
will
be
the
policy
holder
in
holding.
however,
in
these
cases
or
in
this
case
as
demonstrated
by
the
exhibits
in
the
record,
the
banks
followed
another
procedure.
they
took
out
group
life
insurance
policies,
beginning
1948
or
each
bank
took
out
a
group
life
insurance
policy,
covering
the
lives
of
their
borrowers
who
qualify.
in
1948,
this
was
with
the
credit
life
insurance
company
of
ohio.
in
1953,
this
was
changed
to
another
group
policy
with
the
american
banker's
life
insurance
company
of
florida.
so
that
the
procedure
that
was
followed
was
when
a
borrower
came
to
the
bank,
his
loan
was
approved.
the
loan
officer,
we
are
told
made
available,
informed
him
or
offered,
the
record
of
course
does
not
repeat
the
conversations,
but
hard
selling
and
the
soft
selling
and
then
this
interest
in
selling,
both
sides
were
interested
and
we
do
not
suggest
that
it
makes
a
difference
whether
this
was
pressed
or
not.
in
any
event,
credit
life
insurance
was
offered
or
made
available
to
the
borrower,
as
necessary,
it
was
explained
to
him,
ultimately
it
is
desired.
if
he
was
interested,
he
was
given
by
the
bank
an
application
form
to
fill
out.
there
are
copies
in
the
record,
they
are
relatively
simple.
the
qualifications
are,
minute,
you
have
to
be
under
65
and
yes,
some
other
minor
matters,
but
this
is
a
sample
form,
the
borrower
interested
filled
it
out.
it
was
then
examined
by
a
bank
employee
and
if
satisfactory,
the
premium
was
collected
or
added
to
the
amount
of
his
loan.
the
bank
employee
then
made
out
and
delivered
to
the
borrower
a
certificate
of
insurance
and
there
are
copies
of
those
in
the
record.
well,
they
are
numbered
exhibits
and
i
assume
that
they
can
be
accepted.
it
is
another
very
simple
document.
it
is
important
i
think
that
at
this
time
the
insurance
was
effective.
if
the
borrower
had
been
killed
in
traffic
on
the
way
home
from
the
bank,
he
was
insured.
his
loan
would
be
paid
off.
the
insurance
companies
which
issued
these
group
policies
to
the
banks
received
the
commissions,
well,
i
should
go
back
a
step.
when
the
bank
had
issued
this
certificate
to
the
borrower,
it
turned
over
the
premium
and
the
papers
involved
to
the
management
company
which
made
appropriate
records
and
then
forwarded
the
premium
and
the
appropriate
records
to
the
insurance
company.
the
insurance
company,
both
credit
life
of
ohio
and
american
bankers
of
florida
remitted
generous
commissions
varying
from
--
between
1948
and
1954,
from
40
to
55
%
of
the
premiums
involved.
these
were
paid
to
smith
and
sons,
the
insurance
agent
subsidiary
though
it
had
nothing
to
do
at
all
with
either
selling
or
perfecting
the
insurance
that
had
been
done
by
the
bank
and
their
employees.
oddly
enough
and
for
reasons
which
an
executive
vice
president
of
treasury
of
the
management
company
testified,
he
could
not
recall.
these
commissions
were
not
included
in
the
taxable
income
of
the
insurance
agency
or
of
the
bank,
but
of
the
management
company
and
the
testimony
as
i
say
just
a
blank,
the
vice
president
of
the
treasury
said
i
just
cannot
remember
why
it
was
done
that
way.
in
any
event
this
was
the
procedure
that
went
on
from
1948,
until
1954.
late
in
1953
the
american
national
insurance
company
of
texas
approached
the
holding
company
with
a
new
plan,
a
slight
variant
on
the
o.
it
had
noticed
--
mr.
ernest
j.
brown
certainly
your
honor.
mr.
ernest
j.
brown
well,
there
was
no
insurance
company
at
that
time
your
honor.
the
insurance
company
is
formed
and
comes
into
being
in
1954.
mr.
ernest
j.
brown
your
honor,
these
were
all
the
same
rates.
as
you
know
there
is
very
little
graduation
in
corporate
rates.
the
banks,
the
management
company
and
the
insurance
agency,
none
as
a
loss
corporation
in
that
way
so
that
--
i
suppose
except
for
a
purist,
it
made
no
great
difference.
there
was
no
revenue
difference
necessary
that
might
have
been.
i
cannot
say
because
i
have
not
the
returns
before
me
that
for
all
those
six
years
the
--
all
of
the
corporations
possibly
involved
were
in
the
roughly
50%
bracket
rather
than
in
the
roughly
22%
bracket.
but
we
will
accept
these
were
prosperous
corporations
and
i
think
it
is
highly
probable
that
it
may
be.
if
the
management
--
mr.
ernest
j.
brown
if
the
management
company
was
in
a
lower
bracket
to
we
are
making
no
point
of
it
as
you
suggest.
these
as
opposed
to
an
insurance
company
or
corporations
which
are
taxed
all
in
the
same
manner,
regular
purposes.
mr.
ernest
j.
brown
yes,
well,
i
can
tell
you
that.
now
the
management
company
had
no
function
at
all.
it
just
copied
and
made
copies
and
forwarded
to
the
--
mr.
ernest
j.
brown
no.
that
is
not
correct,
justice
white.
the
employees
of
the
bank
were
the
ones
who
filled
out.
the
--
who
supervised
--
mr.
ernest
j.
brown
for
transmission,
for
making
their
own
records
and
transmitting
to
the
insurance
company.
mr.
ernest
j.
brown
it
made
records,
your
honor.
it
was
an
accounting
company
but
all
of
the
contact
with
the
costumers,
the
filling
out
of
applications,
delivery
of
the
certificate
was
by
bank
employees
with
the
company.
now,
there
is
no
alternative
allocation
to
the
management
company.
that
is
not
before
the
court
of
course
in
this
case
and
in
case
that
should
be
remanded.
i
would
be
embarrassed
if
i
stood
and
then
cut
the
ground
from
under
the
commissioner,
but
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
i
have
not
considered
the
management
company
and
it
seems
to
have
been
largely
a
transmittal
tower,
keeping
its
zone.
they
didn't
have
xerox
machines,
but
if
they
ran
these
through
the
xerox
machine
and
sent
them
on,
where
i
suppose
the
function
would
then
perform.
in
any
event,
in
1953,
the
american
national
company
came
in
with
a
new
plan.
it
proposed
that
it'd
be
the
prime
underwriter
on
the
credit
life
insurance.
however,
that
the
holding
company
form
a
subsidiary
and
that
that
subsidiary
re-insure
all
these
risks,
american
national
had
noted
that
financial
institutions
were
forming
their
own
subsidiary
or
affiliate
insurance
companies
and
the
record
indicates
it
were
not
the
key
part
of
business,
it
could.
so,
it
suggested
that
for
8
(b),
it
would
supply
accounting
services,
some
record
keeping,
the
insurance
company
record
keeping,
actuarial
services.
the
staff
like
of
an
insurance
company,
but
this
would
be
for
8
(b),
and
then
it
would
re-insure
all
this
risks
with
this
subsidiary
to
be
formed
so
that
the
risk
was
then
shifted.
mr.
ernest
j.
brown
well,
i
suppose
the
lawyers
did
the
drafting
of
the
documents,
your
honor
but
--
mr.
ernest
j.
brown
no,
no,
no.
the
--
well,
we
are
told
by
the
record
that
this
was
in
fact
done
by
most
of
the
--
by
american
national.
the
findings
are
that
other
than
the
payment
of
loses,
that
bank
charges
and
taxes
that
the
newly
formed
reinsurance
company
had
little
in
the
way
of
expenses.
indeed
the
findings
of
the
tax
court
which
set
out
the
expenses
had
showed
a
very
minute
figure
there.
so
it
was,
i
think
i
do
not
exaggerate
if
i
say
it
was
largely
passive.
it
had
investment
problems
of
course,
but
it
had
substantial
funds.
mr.
ernest
j.
brown
the
comptroller
has
come,
we
are
coming
justice
douglas
to
the
question
of
the
authority
of
banks
to
participate.
the
comptroller
has
taken
the
position
that
a
bank
may
as
an
incident
to
its
lending
function,
handle
insurance
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
saxon
case
which
is
cited
in
both
briefs
held
that
this
was
improper
and
invalidated
the
ruling
of
the
comptroller
and
enjoined
the
banks
from
participating
in
the
selling
of
insurance.
mr.
ernest
j.
brown
no
your
honor,
this
is
very
peculiar.
the
statute;
we
have
no
statute
at
all
that
does
anything.
there
is
this
1916
statute
which
says
that
national
banks
in
a
small
town
may
be
insurance
agents.
now
the
comptroller
says,
well
that
is
general
business.
he
does
not
care
that
the
banks
can
be
on
the
general,
but
that
they
can
assist
their
lending
functions.
the
taxpayers
and
perhaps
properly,
i
do
not
think
we
have
to
ask
the
court
for
a
decision
on
that
banking
question,
the
taxpayers
read
that
statute
or
part
of
that
statute
because
this
is
one
of
the
curious
aspects
as
though
it
said
banks
in
small
towns
and
only
banks
in
small
towns,
they
do
the
following
things.
they
have
been
stressed
the
thing,
the
section
that
says,
banks
may
receive
commissions.
they
do
not
mention
the
fact
that
the
statute
also
says
that
banks
may
collect
premiums
and
sell
insurance
in
that
generally.
the
banks
in
this
case
fairly
effectuated
the
insurance.
however,
this
was
put
into
operation.
security
life
was
formed
with
a
capital
of
25,000,
paid
in
surplus
of
12,500;
37,500
in
net
worth.
at
the
end
of
the
year,
it
was
re-insuring
risks
of
over
6
million.
at
the
end
of
1959,
it
was
re-insuring
risks
of
over
41
million.
mr.
ernest
j.
brown
your
honors
as
i
was
pointing
out,
beginning
in
1954
the
banks
remitted
premiums
to
american
national.
it
kept
some
13.5
%
of
those
premiums
for
its
fees.
the
remaining
86.5
were
remitted
to
security
life.
this
business
was
very
profitable
for
security
life
with
a
net
worth
of
$37,500.00
at
the
outset
in
1954.
by
the
end
of
1959
it
had
a
net
worth
of
$850,000.00
and
it
paid
a
$389,000.00
dividend
so
in
five
years
with
a
capitalization
on
original
net
worth
of
$37,500.00,
it
had
profits
after
reserves
and
after
expenses
of
a
$1,200,000.00.
the
commissioner
allocated
40%
of
the
premiums
then
to
the
banks
on
the
theory
that
the
banks
had
performed
the
services
which
resulted
in
the
insurance.
they
had
effectuated
the
insurance
and
that
the
market
demonstrated
that
commissions
of
a
minimum
40%
were
allocable.
on
these
facts
it
would
be
very
difficult
even
to,
i
think
to
raise
a
substantial
question,
but
the
facts
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
ernest
j.
brown
well,
that
is
the
next
question
mr.
chief
justice.
the
taxpayers
make
the
point
that
and
they
have
repeated
frequently
in
their
briefs
that
the
banks
could
not
receive
these
commissions.
and
as
i
was
pointing
out
in
answer
to
justice
douglas’
question,
justice
white
suggested,
this
is
considerably
more
complicated
than
that.
the
only
statute
is
when
it
permits
banks
in
small
towns
to
engage
in
general
insurance
agents.
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
believes
and
has
ruled
that
this
type
of
transaction
is
perfectly
proper
for
banks.
however,
the
fifth
circuit
has
enjoined
banks
from
participating
in
just
this
type
of
transaction.
it
is
interesting
that
the
fifth
circuit
and
there
is
a
substantial
question
of
standing
as
the
suit
was
brought
by
insurance
agents,
the
fifth
circuit
ruled,
surveying
a
fairly
lengthy
statutory
history
and
more
of
what
congress
had
failed
to
do
than
what
it
had
done
that
there
was
an
inhibition
on
the
banks
and
that
this
was
to
protect
insurance
agencies
to
avoid
competition
by
banks
with
insurance
agents.
well,
i
think
it
is
clear
that
what
the
banks
did
here
ousted
an
insurance
agents
of
a
substantial
business.
it
is
not
our
point
either
to
exonerate
or
indict
the
banks
for
what
they
did,
but
only
to
describe
what
they
did.
so
even
if
you
take
the
statute
as
i
suggested
earlier
that
authorizes
small
town
banks
to
act
as
agents
to
sell
insurance,
to
collect
premiums
and
then
to
receive
commissions,
it
seems
to
me
a
peculiarly
narrow
reading
to
focus
only
on
the
receiving
commissions.
the
banks
effectuated
this
insurance
and
it
is
not
for
me
to
say
whether
they
were
insurance
--
mr.
ernest
j.
brown
yes
sir.
mr.
ernest
j.
brown
and
that
is
what
--
on
any
ground
whether,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
correct.
mr.
ernest
j.
brown
no
your
honor,
i
think
not.
i
think
under
--
if
we
had
been
involved
in
the
years
before
1954,
we
would
have.
as
judge
friendly
pointed
out,
1961,
this
court's
decision
in
lucas
and
earl,
chicago
and
joliet
railroad,
is
as
he
said,
a
blunt
instrument.
usually
that
is
an
all
or
nothing.
now,
we
would
not
claim
that
all
the
payments
to
the
life
insurance
company
were
income
to
the
banks
because
the
life
insurance
company
did
perform
the
function
of
re-insuring
these
writs.
it
was
a
minimum
capital,
but
it
did
that.
so
here,
482
provides
for
allocation
as
it
often
requires
analysis
of
prices,
of
services.
1961
is
the
blunter
instrument.
judge
friendly’s
opinion
in
the
ruben
(ph)
case
which
is
cited
makes
a
point
of
that.
so
we
would
--
i
do
not
know,
i
shouldn't
say
that
it's
universal,
that
no
court
has
ever
analyzed
a
transaction
and
said
part
of
the
income
was
uncommon
to
lucas
and
earl,
but
482
is
the
more
flexible,
and
more
surgical
instrument
and
it
seems
appropriate
here
that
that
should
be.
it
presumes
that
their
will
be
no
receipts.
it
does
not
ask
the
bank
to
receive
the
money,
but
it
says
the
bank
is
taxable
as
though
it
had.
that
has
been
true
since
lucas
and
earl.
so
that
i
do
not
think
that
makes
any
difference
and
i
would
like
to
demonstrate
this.
i
think
two
simple
cases
would
demonstrate
that
even
if
this
prohibition
on
receipt
were
verbatim
in
the
statute
as
indeed
it
was
in
local
finance,
the
indiana
statute
was
there
quite
explicit,
but
two
simple
cases.
the
first
let
us
take
a
public
office
or
a
purchasing
agent
and
let
us
make
it
federal
since
it
is
a
federal
statute,
and
some
point
it
is
made
of
that.
he
is
prohibited
by
a
statute,
we
will
say,
from
receiving
any
funds
or
moneys
from
any
person
with
whom
he
deals,
a
person
deals
with
his
office
customarily
and
would
like
more
business
than
he
has
been
to
get,
approaches
him
and
offers
him
a
substantial
sum
of
money.
he
says,
i
cannot
take
it,
the
law
prohibits
it
and
then
he
remarks,
i
have
a
son
in
college,
he
could
certainly
use
some
extra
money,
he
is
always
complaining
that
he
does
not
have
enough.
the
visitor
thinks
he
understands
what
has
been
said
and
promptly
they
also
check
to
the
son
in
college
who
inquires
it
is
proven,
and
is
told
to
keep
it.
now,
i
assume
that
it
would
be
no
question,
that
is
income
to
the
father.
let
us
bring
it
a
step
closer
to
this
case,
in
fact
i
would
say
almost
identical
with
this
case.
instead
of
the
son
in
college,
the
purchasing
officer
says,
no
i
cannot
take
your
money
and
the
conversation
goes
on
and
then
he
indicates
he
had
inherited
an
orchard
a
few
years
back
and
he
had
incorporated
it,
his
farms
incorporated
and
they
sell
the
produce.
the
visitor
at
a
little
polite
in
direction
says
he
is
interested
in
inquiring
apples
and
peaches
and
says
i
will
pay
you,
i
will
pay
farms
incorporated
a
price
which
is
obviously
far
above
the
market.
the
price
is
accepted,
farms
incorporated
receives
the
money.
i
think
there
could
be
no
question
that
though
the
statute
prohibits
the
officer
from
receiving
these
funds
that
482
would
allow
the
commissioner
to
allocate
that
money
to
him.
the
fifth
circuit
has
had
no
difficulty
where
purchasing
officers
who
in
such
oblique
fashion
had
funds
paid
to
them
(inaudible).
so
that
seems
to
this
case.
i
cannot
believe
the
statute
is
more.
we
are
not
concern
with
the
legality
or
illegality
of
the
banks
whether
they
skirted
the
edge
of
collegiality
makes
no
difference.
they
performed
a
valuable
economic
function.
the
commissioner
and
the
tax
court
reviewing
him
decided
that
it
was
highly
appropriate
that
the
market
value
of
this
function
be
allocated
to
the
banks.
i
would
like
to
reserve
if
i
may
any
such
remaining
times
i
have
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
ernest
j.
brown
just
a
--
mr.
ernest
j.
brown
i
do
not
have
the
record
justice
brennan
i
am
sorry
i
do
not
know
what
the
figures
are.
there
is
a
substantial
difference
and
it
stands
and
it
is
right
in
saying
that
the
rates
are,
but
there
is
still
a
substantial
difference
in
the
method
of
computation
of
income
taxes
for
insurance
companies
and
others.
i
would
like
to
point
out
briefly
on
the
post
--
this
time
when
it
been
--
the
banks
suggested
they
might
cancel
the
re-insurance.
american
national
said
it
was
then
paying
insurance
to
--
commissions
to
in
its
designated
agency.
but
mr.
anderson
has
referred
to
national
carbide
which
is
rather
interesting
because
there
by
contract
income
was
payable
to
a
parent
corporation
but
it
was
taxed
to
subsidiaries
because
they
are
ended
and
in
this
case
the
adjustments,
the
parent
corporation
is
no
great
hardship.
the
parent
corporation
can
make
any
adjustments.
the
commissioner
will
allow
of
course
corresponding
deductions
to
the
--
mr.
ernest
j.
brown
the
statute
does
not
require
it.
of
course,
identity
requires
common
control
of
50%,
but
in
any
event
the
possibility
of
divorce
i
take
it
cannot
frustrate
the
use
of
482
for
the
years
when
there
is
common
control
