i
have

a

justice

well,
that
may
be

a

the

which
then
gave
it

what
about
the

it

i
am

it
wasn't
possible
for
the

was
that

the

tax

justice

let

so
it
is
perfectly

that
a

could
in

with
(inaudible)
the
generating
credit
life
insurance
taking
commission?
justice

and
then
let

assume
that
the

these

continued
not

take
a

although
in

it
performed
they
would

and
they
had
the

said
be
