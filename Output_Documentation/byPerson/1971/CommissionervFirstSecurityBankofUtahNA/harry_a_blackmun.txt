justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
brown,
could
i
just
ask
one
detail.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
was
the
difference
in
tax
rate
by
the
inclusion
of
those
premiums
in
the
management
company's
returns
as
distinguished
from
the
insurance
company?
was
this
not
to
be
advantage
of
those
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
in
any
event
it
was
reported
by
the
management
company
at
then
corporate
rates,
i
take
it.
did
the
government
lose
by
this?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
anderson,
this
--
in
these
remarks
you
have
made,
are
you
attacking
the
implementation
of
section
484
or
the
section
itself?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
are
not
questioning
the
integrity
of
it
as
a
tool
in
the
tax
structure?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
what
would
be
position
if
an
officer
of
the
bank
had
received
or
had
embezzled
income
and
instead
of
keeping
it
himself
had
placed
it
in
the
bank,
would
--
and
the
bank
in
some
way
will
be
responsible
for
it.
would
the
bank
be
taxable
on
that
embezzled
income?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
the
distinction
you
draw
then
is
only
in
the
fact
of
receipt
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--
not
the
illegality?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
then
at
that
point
let
me
ask
you
this?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
if
you
should
lose
by
chance
on
this
argument,
are
you
also
attacking
the
allocation
itself,
percentage
wise?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
alright.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes.
but
there
is
(voice
overlap)
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
which
the
ultimate
owners
can
get
their
hands
on?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
suppose
that
is
not
true,
i
mean,
the
state
tax
side,
is
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
estate,
federal
estate
tax
side,
where
we
have
includable
in
the
gross
statement
many
things
that
are
no
longer
owned
by
the
decedent
at
his
death.
not
a
good
(voice
overlap)
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
(voice
overlap)
certain
types
of
trust
that
are
included
there.
we
have
gifts
in
contemplation
of
death
which
are
included,
none
of
which
are
owned
at
the
time
of
death
and
yet
are
taxable
for
federal
estate
tax
purposes?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
(inaudible)
if
you
are
right
of
getting
the
contemplation
of
that.
my
memory
is
hazy,
but
let
me
--
aren't
there
some
old
cases
about
gifts
or
future
bonds,
coupons
that
ought
to
be
due
in
the
future?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
certainly
there
is
no
right
at
the
time
of
those
coupons
be
mature
to
receive?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
anderson,
tell
me
once
again
your
posture
with
respect
to
the
seventh
circuit
case
of
local
finance,
do
you
feel
it
is
wrong
or
do
you
feel
it
is
distinguishable?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
is
it
your
point
that
the
--
that
was
they
are
trying
to
reallocate
to
the
banks
as
already
been
taxed
at
some
rate,
in
some
amount
to
the
insurance
company?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
mean,
post
1959?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
there
is
still
a
difference?
justice
harry
a.

the
rate
