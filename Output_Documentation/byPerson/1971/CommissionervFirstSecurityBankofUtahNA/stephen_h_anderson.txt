mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
as
far
as
these
national
banks
in
salt
lake
city,
utah
and
boise,
idaho
are
concerned
is
whether
or
not
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
purporting
to
use
the
authority
of
section
482
of
the
internal
revenue
code
can
allocate
to
them
insurance
related
income
which
the
banks
neither
received
nor
could
lawfully
receive
those
resulting
in
a
tax
where
this
is
no
income
and
could
never
be
any
income
and
will
never
be
any
income
not
withstanding
any
outcome
of
this
case.
the
commissioner’s
position
in
this
case
is
wrong
for
a
number
of
reasons.
it
is
wrong,
so
wrong
that
commentators
across
the
country
have
uniformly
criticized
it.
referring
to
this
specific
case,
we
have
cited
two
of
those
articles
in
our
brief.
one
is
currently
a
review
of
an
address
given
at
the
chicago
tax
institute,
it
is
mr.
o'lean's
(ph)
article,
cited
on
page
9
of
our
brief.
it
attempts
to
overturn
all
applicable
persons
in
the
area
with
the
sole
exception,
the
sole
aberration
of
local
finance
and
i
might
add
to
the
court,
and
i
am
sure
the
court
has
probably
already
picked
this
up
from
the
briefs
that
both
courts
below
in
this
case
were
in
favor
of
the
taxpayers
position.
judge
fay
who
was
in
the
courtroom
the
day
i
understand,
judge
fay
after
hearing
our
case
dissented
in
local
finance
and
then
seeing
that
--
feeling
that
he
was
bound
by
local
finance
ruled
against
the
taxpayer
in
the
tax
court.
in
addition
your
honors,
and
i
understand
this
is
correct
that
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
has
made
his
opposition
to
the
internal
revenue
services
position
known.
i
am
informed
that
that
is
correct
and
a
copy
of
the
letter
which
he
has
sent
to
the
solicitor
general’s
office
has
been
made
available
to
these
member
national
banks.
in
a
letter
of
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
asked
the
solicitor
general
to
make
his
views
known
to
this
court
that
the
comptroller
opposed
the
internal
revenue
service
position.
i
am
not
sure
that
that
point
was
adequately
made.
i
might
request
that
it
would
be
helpful
for
the
court
to
have
a
copy
of
the
comptroller’s
views
attached
to
the
record
for
a
review.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
the
implementation.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
no
your
honor.
the
errors
which
we
--
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
you
say
the
employee
embezzled
the
income?
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
no.
we
would
say
that
the
bank
would
not
be
taxable,
the
employee
would.
that
is
the
james
case
cited
at
page
29
and
30
of
the
government’s
brief
and
that
is
a
180
degrees
we
submit
from
the
present
situation.
there
in
that
case,
the
illegal
income
was
actually
received.
in
this
case
illegal
income
was
not
received
because
it
will
be
illegal
to
take
it.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
well,
it
is
correct.
the
fact
of
receipt
is
the
controlling
distinction.
the
illegality
in
this
case
goes
further
to
buttress
other
points
that
we
would
make.
on
the
example
you
gave,
it
is
the
fact
of
receipt,
that
is
correct.
we
submit
that
the
errors
in
the
government’s
position
and
there
are
a
number
of
them
and
i
will
go
through
at
least
three
main
errors
in
the
government’s
position.
all
find
themselves
bottomed
on
one
main
circumstance
which
we
do
not
think
has
been
adequately
represented
to
the
court.
for
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
century,
these
banks
have
made
credit
life,
health
and
accident
insurance
available
to
their
borrowers
and
we
might
add
that
their
contacts
with
this
insurance
was
so
small
that
it
caused
the
banks
for
the
activity
of
all
their
branches
and
all
of
their
personnel
less
than
$2,000.00
a
year
per
bank
to
process
the
insurance
characterized
by
both
courts
below
as
negligible.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
yes.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
we
surely
are,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
your
honor,
that
is
one
of
the
main
points
of
our
case.
the
banks
charged
nothing.
the
banks
received
a
substantial
benefit
just
by
having
insurance
available
on
the
premises.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
record
shows
that
over
one-half
million
dollars
in
bank
loans
were
paid
off
by
the
discharge
of
this
insurance
on
people
who
died,
who
and
the
banks
charged
--
the
banks
received
their
benefit
in
that
fashion.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
no,
your
honor.
the
banks
paperwork
was
de
minimis,
both
--
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
that
was
the
amount
that
was
charged
by
american
national
insurance
company
for
servicing
the
insurance
for
--
well,
if
i
can
the
diagram
this
way.
here
would
be
the
banks,
here
is
their
holding
company,
here
is
the
sister
life
insurance
company,
security
life
until
1959.
american
national
was
an
independent,
unrelated
insurer
up
here.
the
insurance
went
from
american
national
through
a
group
policy
in
the
banks
to
the
borrower
and
the
obligation
was
between
the
borrower
and
american
national.
then
american
national
re-insured
the
risk,
$41,000,000.00
worth
by
1959,
re-insured
the
risk
down
to
security
life
and
did
all
of
the
actuarial
work
for
security
life
and
charged
11
cents,
actually
it
is
15
cents,
charged
security
life
that
much
and
then
remitted
the
security
life
the
balance.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
that
is
another
main
point
of
our
case,
no.
the
amicus
brief
in
this
case;
first
let
--
may
i
make
two
--
just
two
points
on
that.
the
amicus
brief
in
this
case
sets
up
the
situation
which
we
arguendo
tried
to
point
out
in
our
brief
and
that
is
that
the
commissioner
has
had
a
basic
underlying
fallacy
on
his
reason,
in
his
reasoning.
he
says
that
in
an
unrelated,
uncontrolled
situation
a
commission
would
be
paid.
in
the
amicus
situation
for
many,
many
years
the
automobile
dealers
in
michigan
made
available
credit
life,
health
and
accident
insurance
in
connection
with
gmac
financing
and
they
took
no
commissions
nor
did
any
related
entity
or
person
take
any
commissions.
but
gmac
kept
100%
of
the
premiums
paid.
the
reason
for
that
being
that
it
was
against
the
law
for
the
automobile
dealers
in
michigan
to
receive
the
commission.
that
is
point
number
one.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
yes.
yes,
you
are
entirely
correct.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
that
is
the
key
phrase.
when
somebody
in
their
family
could
collect
it
and
that
is
correct.
this
--
as
firmly
established
--
excuse
me.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
in
the
original
years,
1948
to
1954,
the
testimony
is
on
the
record
that
the
income
was
so
small
that
it
virtually
passed
notes.
it
should
have
been
taken
into
income
by
the
smith.
it
was
taken
into
income
by
management
company
and
when
asked
in
testimony
that
the
executive
vice-president
said
it
just
escaped
notice.
it
was
a
mistake,
but
as
firmly
embedded
in
the
tax
law
as
any
principle,
the
commissioner
cites
here
is
the
principle
established
by
this
court
in
moline
properties
and
national
carbide
and
in
other
cases
that
the
taxpayers
may
structure
their
affairs
anyway
they
please
notwithstanding
that
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
does
not
like
the
structure
and
you
are
right
your
honors
so
long
as
lawfully
some
related
entity
could
take
this
money
then
the
holding
company
was
anxious
for
the
entity
to
take
the
money.
but
the
very
bottom
fact
to
this
case
and
i
submit
the
commissioner
has
not
shown
anything
to
the
contrary,
the
very
bottom
fact
of
this
case
if
i
had
not
made
any
point
at
all
while
i
am
up
here
is
this
point
that
if
that
thing
in
salt
lake
city,
your
invoicing
was
completely
isolated
from
any
other
related
entity
on
a
desert
island
or
some
place
doing
business
and
there
was
no
related
entity
that
it
would
not
take
these
commissions
because
there
is
a
violation
of
federal
banking
law
so
to
do.
the
penalties
for
violation
at
federal
banking
law
are
very
severe.
there
are
laws
that
corporations
and
banking
franchise
had
criminal
liability
on
the
part
of
the
directors.
now,
this
is
no
closely
held
tiny
little
group
that
served
a
profit,
that
people
that
served
a
profit
by
devices
or
contrivances.
these
are
national
banks
publicly
owned
through
holding
company.
the
directors
of
these
banks
had
no
personal
stake
in
this.
they
were
trying
to
abide
by
the
law.
the
law
said
the
banks
could
not
take
this
income
and
again
i
can
--
excuse
me.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
by
all
means?
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
yes
sir.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
it
has
your
honor.
in
1959,
the
tax,
the
income
tax,
the
life
insurance
tax
act
was
passed.
the
lower
court,
judge
fay
referred
to
that.
under
that
law
insurance
companies
are
taxed
at
exactly
the
same
rate
as
any
other
corporation.
the
only
difference
is
that
because
of
reserves
which
must
be
set
up
to
protect
the
policy
holders,
that
the
timing
is
slightly
different,
but
the
whole
corporation
labels
apply.
the
only
thing
it
is
different
is
time.
but
i
again
--
i
must
emphasize
this
point.
if
i
sit
down
with
no
point
made,
it
must
be
this
point,
but
this
point
it
must
be
this
point
and
that
is
that
these
banks
would
not
take
commissions
illegally,
notwithstanding
the
outcome
of
this
case,
notwithstanding
anything
that
would
happen,
these
banks
will
not
take
insurance
related
income.
the
record
shows
that
they
have
been
advised
by
counsel
not
to
take
that
income.
our
law
firm
gave
that
advice.
the
advice
will
be
honored
and
they
will
not
take
that
income.
the
only
thing
that
the
commissioner
could
achieve
in
this
case
would
be
the
unheard
of
result
of
taxing
these
banks,
exacting
a
tax
out
of
the
treasury
of
these
banks
when
there
is
no
income
that
the
banks
can
get
their
hands
on
ever.
thus
there
will
be
a
tax
without
income
ever.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
yes
your
honor?
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
now,
that
is
another
good
point.
the
government
infers
in
its
brief
that
somehow
all
of
this
is
mashed
together
and
the
income
is
there
to
be
paid
down.
in
1959
your
honor,
the
security
life
insurance
company
of
texas
was
spurned
off
pursuant
to
the
bank
holding
company
act
of
1956,
was
spurned
off
to
a
new
holding
company
group.
the
record
shows
at
page
1
--
at
page
51
that
after
that
spin
off,
the
dividend
which
mr.
brown
referred
to
was
paid
up
to
the
new
parent.
the
record
also
shows
that
there
was
a
developing
difference
in
the
shareholders
of
those
corporations
so
that
by
1967
they
were
substantially
different.
the
commissioner
points
out
in
his
reply
brief
and
raises
an
implication
that
i
am
glad
is
raised
because
we
have
not
been
able
to
get
to
the
point
feeling
the
record
was
closed,
but
he
implies
in
his
reply
brief
that
when
these
two
entities
were
reconsolidated
back
1970
that
somehow
this
money
came
back
in,
that
is
not
so.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
one
half
of
my
argument
would
fall.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
i
would
have
one-half
of
my
argument,
one-half
would
fall
in
it
--
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
the
half
--
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
then
we
would
get
into
the
earnings.
the
amount
of
allocations,
the
right
of
taxpayer
to
structure
their
affairs
as
they
chose
and
all
of
that
would
have
to
be
examined.
the
first
half
of
my
argument
is
that
we
do
not
even
have
to
get
to
that
in
this
case
because
as
i
will
point
out
in
a
minute
under
section
61,
this
court
has
long
held
that
the
taxpayers
will
not
be
taxed
unless
there
is
an
income,
that
is
what
it
is
called,
an
income
tax.
in
--
well
excuse
me
your
honor,
have
i
finished
answering
your
question.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
alright.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
i
just
wanted
to
say
this
that
it
has
been
always
been
the
law,
always
without
any
deviation.
there
is
not
one
authority
the
commissioner
has
cited
to
this
court,
not
one.
it
has
always
been
the
law
that
tax
is
not
exacted
unless
there
has
been
an
actual
receipt
of
money
or
the
right
to
receive
money.
in
harrison
versus
schaffner,
lucas
versus
earl,
corliss
versus
bowers,
commissioner
versus
glenshaw
glass
and
a
host
of
other
cases
decided
by
this
court
that
principle
is
as
deeply
embedded
in
the
tax
fabric
of
this
country
as
any
there
is.
there
has
never
been
a
case
contrary
to
that.
in
corliss
versus
bowers
this
court
said
this.
it
said,
income
is
that
over
which
a
man
has
an
unfettered
command,
that
he
is
free
to
enjoy
at
his
own
option.
in
commissioner
versus
glenshaw
glass
this
court
described
income
as
that
which
is
clearly
realized
over
which
a
man
has
complete
dominion.
none
of
those
concepts
are
present
in
this
case.
i
submit
that
complete
dominion,
the
right
to
enjoy
at
his
own
option,
unfettered
command
clearly
realized
are
nowhere
in
this
case
because
of
the
national
banking
laws,
the
banks
could
not
take
the
income.
they
had
no
unfettered
command.
they
had
no
complete
dominion
and
foremost
they
had
no
option.
they
had
no
option
whether
or
not
to
take
the
income.
at
the
very
heart
of
our
tax
laws,
i
submit
to
the
court,
at
the
very
root
of
it,
tax
has
always
followed
the
existence
in
the
taxpayer
of
alternatives,
of
options.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
in
the
state
tax
side
i
would
--
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
i
am
a
morman.
i
do
not
know
what
options
a
person
would
have
after
death.
i
--
maybe
he
is
exercising
the
supernatural,
i
do
not
whether
i
got
your
point
your
honor,
but
i
--
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
yes.
the
rule
would
apply,
your
honor.
the
point
is
well
made
that
at
the
time
of
death
the
way
the
estate
tax
law
operates
is
that,
i
think
it
is
section,
what,
2036;
the
way
that
the
estate
tax
operates
is
that
a
man
must
have
had
the
right
at
his
death
to
exercise
ownership
and
control
and
a
whole
host
of
cases
have
developed
out
of
that
concept
that
at
the
man’s
death
he
had
the
right
to
exercise
dominion
over
the
property.
but
--
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
yes
your
honor,
lucas
versus
--
helvering
versus
horst.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
the
critical
distinction
and
we
cite
helvering
versus
horst
in
the
brief
and
we
would
cite
the
contemplation
of
death
is
that
at
some
point
the
taxpayer
had
the
--
he
had
dominion,
he
had
the
right
to
exercise
dominion.
that
is
the
same
with
the
con
--
gift
in
contemplation
of
death.
at
some
point
in
time
your
honor,
the
taxpayer
either
had
the
right
to
exercise
dominion
or
in
fact
exercised
dominion
over
the
money.
now,
that
is
different,
180
degrees
different
from
our
case.
in
our
case
there
has
been
no
right.
there
has
been
no
dominion,
there
has
been
no
exercise
of
dominion
and
can
be
no
exercise
of
dominion
at
any
time.
that
is
the
critical
distinction.
that
is
why
the
government’s
position
is
in
direct
collision
with
precepts
undeviatingly
perpetuated
by
this
court.
it
is
in
direct
cohesion
with
those
precepts.
without
the
citation
of
authority,
rather
it
overturns
all
applicable
precedent
which
we
have
cited
and
discussed
in
our
brief.
now,
this
is
a
tax
case.
taxes
are
complicated
things.
they
themselves
adhere
to
and
follow
a
statute.
in
this
case
it
is
section
482.
we
submit
the
error
of
the
commissioner’s
position
as
mr.
justice
blackmun
pointed
out
is
in
the
implementation
of
the
commissioner’s
position
on
the
statute.
there
are
two
controlling
factors
under
section
482.
the
government
has
made
known
a
number
of
things.
it
has
talked
about
money
and
controlled
entities
and
such,
but
it
has
not
gone
to
the
statute.
the
statute
says
that
it
will
operate
where
a
controlling
entity,
in
this
case
the
holding
company,
has
the
power
arbitrarily
to
tamper
with
the
income,
understate
the
income
of
one
of
these
controlled
entities
and
when
the
holding
company
comes
in
and
tampers
with
the
income
of
this
entity
in
favor
of
this
entity,
but
it
arbitrarily
shifts
the
income
then
the
commissioner
may
come
in
and
examine
that
situation.
we
do
not
have
that
here.
it's
stated
in
terms
of
this
case
the
holding
company
would
have
to
have
the
right
to
affect
the
banks
to
take
the
insurance
income,
but
no
such
right
exists
because
the
banks
would
not
operate
in
violation
of
law.
the
very
fundamental
premise
upon
which
section
482
operates
is
absent
in
this
case.
there
is
no
control
element
which
can
arbitrarily
shift
income.
the
government’s
position
dies
at
the
very
threshold.
the
second
horn
upon
which
section
482
operates
is
in
subsection
c
of
section
--
of
regulation
section
1.482
–
1
(c)
and
it
is
in
the
government’s
brief
in
the
appendix
and
that
states
the
frontiers
of
the
commissioner’s
authority.
the
very
frontiers
of
his
authority
are
stated
in
that
regulation.
the
regulation
says
something
like
this.
the
authority
of
the
commissioner
to
allocate,
to
take
an
action
under
this
section,
and
then
in
effect
goes
on
to
say
as
limited
to
those
situations
and
this
was
the
key
phrase,
those
situations
where
the
income
of
the
taxpayer
would
have
been
different
in
an
uncontrolled
situation
from
that
in
a
controlled
situation,
now,
if
the
income
or
the
taxpayer
is
no
different
in
an
uncontrolled
situation,
how
can
the
commissioner
exercise
authority
in
a
controlled
situation?
that
test
was
applied
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
and
not
repudiated
by
the
commissioner
in
this
case.
it
applies
to
this
case
and
the
answer
to
it
as
found
by
both
courts
below
is
that
these
national
banks
in
an
uncontrolled
situation
would
not
receive
the
type
of
income
which
the
commissioner
tries
to
allocate
to
them.
i
--
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
both
your
honor,
but
since
this
court
granted
certiorari
i
did
not
develop
any
argument
on
the
differences.
in
local
finance
for
instance,
all
the
finance
company
officers
were
licensed
insurance
agents.
when
they
made
a
loan
as
licensed
insurance
agents
they
want
ahead
and
sold
insurance.
they
also
solicited
it
very
heavily.
95%
of
the
borrowers
in
local
finance
took
insurance
whereas
in
our
case
as
little
as
13%
of
the
mortgage
loan
customers
took
insurance.
the
time
and
effort,
the
amount
of
time
it
cost
local
finance
to
handle
the
insurance
was
much
greater
and
so
on,
but
all
of
the
cases
with
the
sole
aberration
of
local
finance
if
it
does
apply
in
some
way,
all
of
the
cases
are
against
the
commissioner.
may
i
call
the
court’s
attention
to
three
rules
of
law.
one
is
the
short
(ph)
case,
the
only
applicable
present
in
this
area
when
this
taxpayers
were
trying
to
fix
their
affairs.
we
cited
in
our
brief
and
discussed
it.
in
that
case
because
of
opa
price
regulations,
it
manufactured,
it
could
not
raise
prices
to
its
wholly
controlled
wholesale.
the
commissioner
came
in
and
tried
to
allocate
income
back
and
the
tax
court
said,
we
will
not
tax
a
taxpayer
who
neither
had
the
right
to
receive
the
income
nor
received
the
income.
that
is
precisely
on
the
point
of
this
case.
the
commissioner
himself
has
recognized
this.
in
two
--
in
the
current
wage
price
freeze
that
president
nixon
embarked
upon
last
fall
the
commissioner
in
technical
information
release
1106,
issued
to
the
public
said
that
where
the
public
because
of
strictures
of
the
law
under
this
current
wage
price
freeze,
more
corporations
did
not
give
out
dividends
and
accumulated
earnings
so
that
there
might
be
otherwise
a
violation
of
section
531
of
the
code
that
the
commissioner
would
not
come
in
and
exact
a
penalty
tax
because
the
taxpayer
was
prevented
by
law
from
doing
something,
from
distributing
the
money
out.
commissioner
himself
has
taken
the
position
that
he
must
follow
the
tendency
of
the
law
in
other
areas.
the
tax
law
does
not
operate
in
a
vacuum.
congress
did
not
pass
the
banking
law
and
the
tax
law
to
operate
independently
of
one
another,
but
rather
to
operate
in
a
harmonious
cooperative
whole.
the
tag
if
--
if
a
rule
is
going
to
be
established
affecting
all
of
the
regulated
industries
of
banking
and
insurance
industries,
congress
should
do
it,
so
that
taxpayers
could
do
it
prospectively
and
not
be
penalized.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
no,
your
honor.
then
i
would
be
back
to
the
other
half
of
our
case.
i
might
add
that
the
commissioner
has
--
well,
i
will
not
add
that.
there
is
no
income.
may
it
please
the
court,
there
is
no
income
from
which
they
discharge
this
tax.
that
income
flowed
out
in
the
1959
reorganization,
it
is
gone.
it
will
never
come
back.
there
will
never
be
any
income
from
which
to
discharge
the
tax
the
commissioner
seeks
to
exact
here,
never.
these
taxpayers
were
in
the
position
of
this
kind
of
a
dilemma.
either
one;
they
pay
the
tax
where
there
is
no
income,
ad
infinitum
thus
affecting
the
financial
soundness
of
these
national
banks
as
opposed
now
by
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
in
this
court
or
two;
take
the
income,
violate
federal
banking
law
and
risk
forfeiture
of
their
charter
and
criminal
liabilities
on
the
part
of
the
directors
or
three;
give
up
insurance
altogether.
now,
we
submit
the
taxing
law
has
never
been
that
unreasonable.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
well,
your
honor,
the
banks
cannot
set
the
rates.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
independent
insurance
companies
would
be
very
jealous
of
a
situation
where
one
bank
on
this
quarter
was
charging
one
rate
and
another
bank
in
this
charge
it
was
charge
--
quarter
was
charging
another
because
it
would
draw
all
of
its
costumers
into
chaos.
the
testimony
in
the
record
is
that
the
banks
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
rates,
but
assuming
arguendo
that
they
did
upon
the
answer
just
to
take
it
further,
assuming
arguendo
that
they
did,
the
testimony
in
this
record
is
un-contradicted
as
if
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
set
part
of
a
premium
rate
which
is
commission.
so
the
banks
would
be
out
of
troubled
waters.
the
commissioner
could
always
come
in.
a
rate
could
be
so
low
that
an
independent
insurance
company
out
here
could
be
losing
money.
they
could
still
chose
to
pay
a
commission.
so
the
banks
would
always
exist
in
jeopardy
of
the
commissioners
caprice
to
come
in
and
say,
aha!
there
is
so
much
commission,
we
allocate
it
to
you,
lose
your
franchise.
no,
there
would
not
be
anyway.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
yes
your
honor.
more
than
a
million
dollars
in
tax
is
set
up
for
those
later
years.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
turns
on
this
case
and
there
is
no
income.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
death
tax
is
all
bunched
in
the
first
years
because
of
the
reserved
deferral.
life
insurance
companies
are
attached
just
like
other
corporations,
but
they
set
out
reserves
and
there
is
a
deferral.
in
the
setting
up
of
the
reserves
and
in
the
previous
income
there
was
this
tax.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
well,
there
will
be
--
the
difference
tails
are
--
the
difference
tails
are.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
yes
sir.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
for
the
years
194
--
1954
to
1959
your
honor,
the
life
insurance
companies
were
not
subject
to
tax
and
has
not
been
taxed.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
post
59,
there
has
been
a
tax.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
well
--
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
i
gave
you
a
figure,
now
i
start
thinking
clearly
about
it.
i
gave
a
figure
which
would
be
reduced
some
by
what
i
presume
would
be
a
correlative
adjustment
and
i
do
not
know
what
the
net
would
be.
i
would
--
we
have
not
even
studied
that,
yes.
hopefully
--
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
are
they
ever,
yes.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
thank
you.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
as
far
as
these
national
banks
in
salt
lake
city,
utah
and
boise,
idaho
are
concerned
is
whether
or
not
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
purporting
to
use
the
authority
of
section
482
of
the
internal
revenue
code
can
allocate
to
them
insurance
related
income
which
the
banks
neither
received
nor
could
lawfully
receive
those
resulting
in
a
tax
where
this
is
no
income
and
could
never
be
any
income
and
will
never
be
any
income
not
withstanding
any
outcome
of
this
case.
the
commissioner’s
position
in
this
case
is
wrong
for
a
number
of
reasons.
it
is
wrong,
so
wrong
that
commentators
across
the
country
have
uniformly
criticized
it.
referring
to
this
specific
case,
we
have
cited
two
of
those
articles
in
our
brief.
one
is
currently
a
review
of
an
address
given
at
the
chicago
tax
institute,
it
is
mr.
o'lean's
(ph)
article,
cited
on
page
9
of
our
brief.
it
attempts
to
overturn
all
applicable
persons
in
the
area
with
the
sole
exception,
the
sole
aberration
of
local
finance
and
i
might
add
to
the
court,
and
i
am
sure
the
court
has
probably
already
picked
this
up
from
the
briefs
that
both
courts
below
in
this
case
were
in
favor
of
the
taxpayers
position.
judge
fay
who
was
in
the
courtroom
the
day
i
understand,
judge
fay
after
hearing
our
case
dissented
in
local
finance
and
then
seeing
that
--
feeling
that
he
was
bound
by
local
finance
ruled
against
the
taxpayer
in
the
tax
court.
in
addition
your
honors,
and
i
understand
this
is
correct
that
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
has
made
his
opposition
to
the
internal
revenue
services
position
known.
i
am
informed
that
that
is
correct
and
a
copy
of
the
letter
which
he
has
sent
to
the
solicitor
general’s
office
has
been
made
available
to
these
member
national
banks.
in
a
letter
of
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
asked
the
solicitor
general
to
make
his
views
known
to
this
court
that
the
comptroller
opposed
the
internal
revenue
service
position.
i
am
not
sure
that
that
point
was
adequately
made.
i
might
request
that
it
would
be
helpful
for
the
court
to
have
a
copy
of
the
comptroller’s
views
attached
to
the
record
for
a
review.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
the
implementation.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
no
your
honor.
the
errors
which
we
--
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
you
say
the
employee
embezzled
the
income?
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
no.
we
would
say
that
the
bank
would
not
be
taxable,
the
employee
would.
that
is
the
james
case
cited
at
page
29
and
30
of
the
government’s
brief
and
that
is
a
180
degrees
we
submit
from
the
present
situation.
there
in
that
case,
the
illegal
income
was
actually
received.
in
this
case
illegal
income
was
not
received
because
it
will
be
illegal
to
take
it.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
well,
it
is
correct.
the
fact
of
receipt
is
the
controlling
distinction.
the
illegality
in
this
case
goes
further
to
buttress
other
points
that
we
would
make.
on
the
example
you
gave,
it
is
the
fact
of
receipt,
that
is
correct.
we
submit
that
the
errors
in
the
government’s
position
and
there
are
a
number
of
them
and
i
will
go
through
at
least
three
main
errors
in
the
government’s
position.
all
find
themselves
bottomed
on
one
main
circumstance
which
we
do
not
think
has
been
adequately
represented
to
the
court.
for
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
century,
these
banks
have
made
credit
life,
health
and
accident
insurance
available
to
their
borrowers
and
we
might
add
that
their
contacts
with
this
insurance
was
so
small
that
it
caused
the
banks
for
the
activity
of
all
their
branches
and
all
of
their
personnel
less
than
$2,000.00
a
year
per
bank
to
process
the
insurance
characterized
by
both
courts
below
as
negligible.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
yes.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
we
surely
are,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
your
honor,
that
is
one
of
the
main
points
of
our
case.
the
banks
charged
nothing.
the
banks
received
a
substantial
benefit
just
by
having
insurance
available
on
the
premises.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
record
shows
that
over
one-half
million
dollars
in
bank
loans
were
paid
off
by
the
discharge
of
this
insurance
on
people
who
died,
who
and
the
banks
charged
--
the
banks
received
their
benefit
in
that
fashion.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
no,
your
honor.
the
banks
paperwork
was
de
minimis,
both
--
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
that
was
the
amount
that
was
charged
by
american
national
insurance
company
for
servicing
the
insurance
for
--
well,
if
i
can
the
diagram
this
way.
here
would
be
the
banks,
here
is
their
holding
company,
here
is
the
sister
life
insurance
company,
security
life
until
1959.
american
national
was
an
independent,
unrelated
insurer
up
here.
the
insurance
went
from
american
national
through
a
group
policy
in
the
banks
to
the
borrower
and
the
obligation
was
between
the
borrower
and
american
national.
then
american
national
re-insured
the
risk,
$41,000,000.00
worth
by
1959,
re-insured
the
risk
down
to
security
life
and
did
all
of
the
actuarial
work
for
security
life
and
charged
11
cents,
actually
it
is
15
cents,
charged
security
life
that
much
and
then
remitted
the
security
life
the
balance.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
that
is
another
main
point
of
our
case,
no.
the
amicus
brief
in
this
case;
first
let
--
may
i
make
two
--
just
two
points
on
that.
the
amicus
brief
in
this
case
sets
up
the
situation
which
we
arguendo
tried
to
point
out
in
our
brief
and
that
is
that
the
commissioner
has
had
a
basic
underlying
fallacy
on
his
reason,
in
his
reasoning.
he
says
that
in
an
unrelated,
uncontrolled
situation
a
commission
would
be
paid.
in
the
amicus
situation
for
many,
many
years
the
automobile
dealers
in
michigan
made
available
credit
life,
health
and
accident
insurance
in
connection
with
gmac
financing
and
they
took
no
commissions
nor
did
any
related
entity
or
person
take
any
commissions.
but
gmac
kept
100%
of
the
premiums
paid.
the
reason
for
that
being
that
it
was
against
the
law
for
the
automobile
dealers
in
michigan
to
receive
the
commission.
that
is
point
number
one.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
yes.
yes,
you
are
entirely
correct.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
that
is
the
key
phrase.
when
somebody
in
their
family
could
collect
it
and
that
is
correct.
this
--
as
firmly
established
--
excuse
me.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
in
the
original
years,
1948
to
1954,
the
testimony
is
on
the
record
that
the
income
was
so
small
that
it
virtually
passed
notes.
it
should
have
been
taken
into
income
by
the
smith.
it
was
taken
into
income
by
management
company
and
when
asked
in
testimony
that
the
executive
vice-president
said
it
just
escaped
notice.
it
was
a
mistake,
but
as
firmly
embedded
in
the
tax
law
as
any
principle,
the
commissioner
cites
here
is
the
principle
established
by
this
court
in
moline
properties
and
national
carbide
and
in
other
cases
that
the
taxpayers
may
structure
their
affairs
anyway
they
please
notwithstanding
that
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
does
not
like
the
structure
and
you
are
right
your
honors
so
long
as
lawfully
some
related
entity
could
take
this
money
then
the
holding
company
was
anxious
for
the
entity
to
take
the
money.
but
the
very
bottom
fact
to
this
case
and
i
submit
the
commissioner
has
not
shown
anything
to
the
contrary,
the
very
bottom
fact
of
this
case
if
i
had
not
made
any
point
at
all
while
i
am
up
here
is
this
point
that
if
that
thing
in
salt
lake
city,
your
invoicing
was
completely
isolated
from
any
other
related
entity
on
a
desert
island
or
some
place
doing
business
and
there
was
no
related
entity
that
it
would
not
take
these
commissions
because
there
is
a
violation
of
federal
banking
law
so
to
do.
the
penalties
for
violation
at
federal
banking
law
are
very
severe.
there
are
laws
that
corporations
and
banking
franchise
had
criminal
liability
on
the
part
of
the
directors.
now,
this
is
no
closely
held
tiny
little
group
that
served
a
profit,
that
people
that
served
a
profit
by
devices
or
contrivances.
these
are
national
banks
publicly
owned
through
holding
company.
the
directors
of
these
banks
had
no
personal
stake
in
this.
they
were
trying
to
abide
by
the
law.
the
law
said
the
banks
could
not
take
this
income
and
again
i
can
--
excuse
me.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
by
all
means?
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
yes
sir.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
it
has
your
honor.
in
1959,
the
tax,
the
income
tax,
the
life
insurance
tax
act
was
passed.
the
lower
court,
judge
fay
referred
to
that.
under
that
law
insurance
companies
are
taxed
at
exactly
the
same
rate
as
any
other
corporation.
the
only
difference
is
that
because
of
reserves
which
must
be
set
up
to
protect
the
policy
holders,
that
the
timing
is
slightly
different,
but
the
whole
corporation
labels
apply.
the
only
thing
it
is
different
is
time.
but
i
again
--
i
must
emphasize
this
point.
if
i
sit
down
with
no
point
made,
it
must
be
this
point,
but
this
point
it
must
be
this
point
and
that
is
that
these
banks
would
not
take
commissions
illegally,
notwithstanding
the
outcome
of
this
case,
notwithstanding
anything
that
would
happen,
these
banks
will
not
take
insurance
related
income.
the
record
shows
that
they
have
been
advised
by
counsel
not
to
take
that
income.
our
law
firm
gave
that
advice.
the
advice
will
be
honored
and
they
will
not
take
that
income.
the
only
thing
that
the
commissioner
could
achieve
in
this
case
would
be
the
unheard
of
result
of
taxing
these
banks,
exacting
a
tax
out
of
the
treasury
of
these
banks
when
there
is
no
income
that
the
banks
can
get
their
hands
on
ever.
thus
there
will
be
a
tax
without
income
ever.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
yes
your
honor?
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
now,
that
is
another
good
point.
the
government
infers
in
its
brief
that
somehow
all
of
this
is
mashed
together
and
the
income
is
there
to
be
paid
down.
in
1959
your
honor,
the
security
life
insurance
company
of
texas
was
spurned
off
pursuant
to
the
bank
holding
company
act
of
1956,
was
spurned
off
to
a
new
holding
company
group.
the
record
shows
at
page
1
--
at
page
51
that
after
that
spin
off,
the
dividend
which
mr.
brown
referred
to
was
paid
up
to
the
new
parent.
the
record
also
shows
that
there
was
a
developing
difference
in
the
shareholders
of
those
corporations
so
that
by
1967
they
were
substantially
different.
the
commissioner
points
out
in
his
reply
brief
and
raises
an
implication
that
i
am
glad
is
raised
because
we
have
not
been
able
to
get
to
the
point
feeling
the
record
was
closed,
but
he
implies
in
his
reply
brief
that
when
these
two
entities
were
reconsolidated
back
1970
that
somehow
this
money
came
back
in,
that
is
not
so.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
one
half
of
my
argument
would
fall.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
i
would
have
one-half
of
my
argument,
one-half
would
fall
in
it
--
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
the
half
--
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
then
we
would
get
into
the
earnings.
the
amount
of
allocations,
the
right
of
taxpayer
to
structure
their
affairs
as
they
chose
and
all
of
that
would
have
to
be
examined.
the
first
half
of
my
argument
is
that
we
do
not
even
have
to
get
to
that
in
this
case
because
as
i
will
point
out
in
a
minute
under
section
61,
this
court
has
long
held
that
the
taxpayers
will
not
be
taxed
unless
there
is
an
income,
that
is
what
it
is
called,
an
income
tax.
in
--
well
excuse
me
your
honor,
have
i
finished
answering
your
question.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
alright.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
i
just
wanted
to
say
this
that
it
has
been
always
been
the
law,
always
without
any
deviation.
there
is
not
one
authority
the
commissioner
has
cited
to
this
court,
not
one.
it
has
always
been
the
law
that
tax
is
not
exacted
unless
there
has
been
an
actual
receipt
of
money
or
the
right
to
receive
money.
in
harrison
versus
schaffner,
lucas
versus
earl,
corliss
versus
bowers,
commissioner
versus
glenshaw
glass
and
a
host
of
other
cases
decided
by
this
court
that
principle
is
as
deeply
embedded
in
the
tax
fabric
of
this
country
as
any
there
is.
there
has
never
been
a
case
contrary
to
that.
in
corliss
versus
bowers
this
court
said
this.
it
said,
income
is
that
over
which
a
man
has
an
unfettered
command,
that
he
is
free
to
enjoy
at
his
own
option.
in
commissioner
versus
glenshaw
glass
this
court
described
income
as
that
which
is
clearly
realized
over
which
a
man
has
complete
dominion.
none
of
those
concepts
are
present
in
this
case.
i
submit
that
complete
dominion,
the
right
to
enjoy
at
his
own
option,
unfettered
command
clearly
realized
are
nowhere
in
this
case
because
of
the
national
banking
laws,
the
banks
could
not
take
the
income.
they
had
no
unfettered
command.
they
had
no
complete
dominion
and
foremost
they
had
no
option.
they
had
no
option
whether
or
not
to
take
the
income.
at
the
very
heart
of
our
tax
laws,
i
submit
to
the
court,
at
the
very
root
of
it,
tax
has
always
followed
the
existence
in
the
taxpayer
of
alternatives,
of
options.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
in
the
state
tax
side
i
would
--
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
i
am
a
morman.
i
do
not
know
what
options
a
person
would
have
after
death.
i
--
maybe
he
is
exercising
the
supernatural,
i
do
not
whether
i
got
your
point
your
honor,
but
i
--
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
yes.
the
rule
would
apply,
your
honor.
the
point
is
well
made
that
at
the
time
of
death
the
way
the
estate
tax
law
operates
is
that,
i
think
it
is
section,
what,
2036;
the
way
that
the
estate
tax
operates
is
that
a
man
must
have
had
the
right
at
his
death
to
exercise
ownership
and
control
and
a
whole
host
of
cases
have
developed
out
of
that
concept
that
at
the
man’s
death
he
had
the
right
to
exercise
dominion
over
the
property.
but
--
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
yes
your
honor,
lucas
versus
--
helvering
versus
horst.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
the
critical
distinction
and
we
cite
helvering
versus
horst
in
the
brief
and
we
would
cite
the
contemplation
of
death
is
that
at
some
point
the
taxpayer
had
the
--
he
had
dominion,
he
had
the
right
to
exercise
dominion.
that
is
the
same
with
the
con
--
gift
in
contemplation
of
death.
at
some
point
in
time
your
honor,
the
taxpayer
either
had
the
right
to
exercise
dominion
or
in
fact
exercised
dominion
over
the
money.
now,
that
is
different,
180
degrees
different
from
our
case.
in
our
case
there
has
been
no
right.
there
has
been
no
dominion,
there
has
been
no
exercise
of
dominion
and
can
be
no
exercise
of
dominion
at
any
time.
that
is
the
critical
distinction.
that
is
why
the
government’s
position
is
in
direct
collision
with
precepts
undeviatingly
perpetuated
by
this
court.
it
is
in
direct
cohesion
with
those
precepts.
without
the
citation
of
authority,
rather
it
overturns
all
applicable
precedent
which
we
have
cited
and
discussed
in
our
brief.
now,
this
is
a
tax
case.
taxes
are
complicated
things.
they
themselves
adhere
to
and
follow
a
statute.
in
this
case
it
is
section
482.
we
submit
the
error
of
the
commissioner’s
position
as
mr.
justice
blackmun
pointed
out
is
in
the
implementation
of
the
commissioner’s
position
on
the
statute.
there
are
two
controlling
factors
under
section
482.
the
government
has
made
known
a
number
of
things.
it
has
talked
about
money
and
controlled
entities
and
such,
but
it
has
not
gone
to
the
statute.
the
statute
says
that
it
will
operate
where
a
controlling
entity,
in
this
case
the
holding
company,
has
the
power
arbitrarily
to
tamper
with
the
income,
understate
the
income
of
one
of
these
controlled
entities
and
when
the
holding
company
comes
in
and
tampers
with
the
income
of
this
entity
in
favor
of
this
entity,
but
it
arbitrarily
shifts
the
income
then
the
commissioner
may
come
in
and
examine
that
situation.
we
do
not
have
that
here.
it's
stated
in
terms
of
this
case
the
holding
company
would
have
to
have
the
right
to
affect
the
banks
to
take
the
insurance
income,
but
no
such
right
exists
because
the
banks
would
not
operate
in
violation
of
law.
the
very
fundamental
premise
upon
which
section
482
operates
is
absent
in
this
case.
there
is
no
control
element
which
can
arbitrarily
shift
income.
the
government’s
position
dies
at
the
very
threshold.
the
second
horn
upon
which
section
482
operates
is
in
subsection
c
of
section
--
of
regulation
section
1.482
–
1
(c)
and
it
is
in
the
government’s
brief
in
the
appendix
and
that
states
the
frontiers
of
the
commissioner’s
authority.
the
very
frontiers
of
his
authority
are
stated
in
that
regulation.
the
regulation
says
something
like
this.
the
authority
of
the
commissioner
to
allocate,
to
take
an
action
under
this
section,
and
then
in
effect
goes
on
to
say
as
limited
to
those
situations
and
this
was
the
key
phrase,
those
situations
where
the
income
of
the
taxpayer
would
have
been
different
in
an
uncontrolled
situation
from
that
in
a
controlled
situation,
now,
if
the
income
or
the
taxpayer
is
no
different
in
an
uncontrolled
situation,
how
can
the
commissioner
exercise
authority
in
a
controlled
situation?
that
test
was
applied
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
and
not
repudiated
by
the
commissioner
in
this
case.
it
applies
to
this
case
and
the
answer
to
it
as
found
by
both
courts
below
is
that
these
national
banks
in
an
uncontrolled
situation
would
not
receive
the
type
of
income
which
the
commissioner
tries
to
allocate
to
them.
i
--
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
both
your
honor,
but
since
this
court
granted
certiorari
i
did
not
develop
any
argument
on
the
differences.
in
local
finance
for
instance,
all
the
finance
company
officers
were
licensed
insurance
agents.
when
they
made
a
loan
as
licensed
insurance
agents
they
want
ahead
and
sold
insurance.
they
also
solicited
it
very
heavily.
95%
of
the
borrowers
in
local
finance
took
insurance
whereas
in
our
case
as
little
as
13%
of
the
mortgage
loan
customers
took
insurance.
the
time
and
effort,
the
amount
of
time
it
cost
local
finance
to
handle
the
insurance
was
much
greater
and
so
on,
but
all
of
the
cases
with
the
sole
aberration
of
local
finance
if
it
does
apply
in
some
way,
all
of
the
cases
are
against
the
commissioner.
may
i
call
the
court’s
attention
to
three
rules
of
law.
one
is
the
short
(ph)
case,
the
only
applicable
present
in
this
area
when
this
taxpayers
were
trying
to
fix
their
affairs.
we
cited
in
our
brief
and
discussed
it.
in
that
case
because
of
opa
price
regulations,
it
manufactured,
it
could
not
raise
prices
to
its
wholly
controlled
wholesale.
the
commissioner
came
in
and
tried
to
allocate
income
back
and
the
tax
court
said,
we
will
not
tax
a
taxpayer
who
neither
had
the
right
to
receive
the
income
nor
received
the
income.
that
is
precisely
on
the
point
of
this
case.
the
commissioner
himself
has
recognized
this.
in
two
--
in
the
current
wage
price
freeze
that
president
nixon
embarked
upon
last
fall
the
commissioner
in
technical
information
release
1106,
issued
to
the
public
said
that
where
the
public
because
of
strictures
of
the
law
under
this
current
wage
price
freeze,
more
corporations
did
not
give
out
dividends
and
accumulated
earnings
so
that
there
might
be
otherwise
a
violation
of
section
531
of
the
code
that
the
commissioner
would
not
come
in
and
exact
a
penalty
tax
because
the
taxpayer
was
prevented
by
law
from
doing
something,
from
distributing
the
money
out.
commissioner
himself
has
taken
the
position
that
he
must
follow
the
tendency
of
the
law
in
other
areas.
the
tax
law
does
not
operate
in
a
vacuum.
congress
did
not
pass
the
banking
law
and
the
tax
law
to
operate
independently
of
one
another,
but
rather
to
operate
in
a
harmonious
cooperative
whole.
the
tag
if
--
if
a
rule
is
going
to
be
established
affecting
all
of
the
regulated
industries
of
banking
and
insurance
industries,
congress
should
do
it,
so
that
taxpayers
could
do
it
prospectively
and
not
be
penalized.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
no,
your
honor.
then
i
would
be
back
to
the
other
half
of
our
case.
i
might
add
that
the
commissioner
has
--
well,
i
will
not
add
that.
there
is
no
income.
may
it
please
the
court,
there
is
no
income
from
which
they
discharge
this
tax.
that
income
flowed
out
in
the
1959
reorganization,
it
is
gone.
it
will
never
come
back.
there
will
never
be
any
income
from
which
to
discharge
the
tax
the
commissioner
seeks
to
exact
here,
never.
these
taxpayers
were
in
the
position
of
this
kind
of
a
dilemma.
either
one;
they
pay
the
tax
where
there
is
no
income,
ad
infinitum
thus
affecting
the
financial
soundness
of
these
national
banks
as
opposed
now
by
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
in
this
court
or
two;
take
the
income,
violate
federal
banking
law
and
risk
forfeiture
of
their
charter
and
criminal
liabilities
on
the
part
of
the
directors
or
three;
give
up
insurance
altogether.
now,
we
submit
the
taxing
law
has
never
been
that
unreasonable.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
well,
your
honor,
the
banks
cannot
set
the
rates.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
independent
insurance
companies
would
be
very
jealous
of
a
situation
where
one
bank
on
this
quarter
was
charging
one
rate
and
another
bank
in
this
charge
it
was
charge
--
quarter
was
charging
another
because
it
would
draw
all
of
its
costumers
into
chaos.
the
testimony
in
the
record
is
that
the
banks
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
rates,
but
assuming
arguendo
that
they
did
upon
the
answer
just
to
take
it
further,
assuming
arguendo
that
they
did,
the
testimony
in
this
record
is
un-contradicted
as
if
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
set
part
of
a
premium
rate
which
is
commission.
so
the
banks
would
be
out
of
troubled
waters.
the
commissioner
could
always
come
in.
a
rate
could
be
so
low
that
an
independent
insurance
company
out
here
could
be
losing
money.
they
could
still
chose
to
pay
a
commission.
so
the
banks
would
always
exist
in
jeopardy
of
the
commissioners
caprice
to
come
in
and
say,
aha!
there
is
so
much
commission,
we
allocate
it
to
you,
lose
your
franchise.
no,
there
would
not
be
anyway.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
yes
your
honor.
more
than
a
million
dollars
in
tax
is
set
up
for
those
later
years.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
turns
on
this
case
and
there
is
no
income.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
death
tax
is
all
bunched
in
the
first
years
because
of
the
reserved
deferral.
life
insurance
companies
are
attached
just
like
other
corporations,
but
they
set
out
reserves
and
there
is
a
deferral.
in
the
setting
up
of
the
reserves
and
in
the
previous
income
there
was
this
tax.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
well,
there
will
be
--
the
difference
tails
are
--
the
difference
tails
are.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
yes
sir.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
for
the
years
194
--
1954
to
1959
your
honor,
the
life
insurance
companies
were
not
subject
to
tax
and
has
not
been
taxed.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
post
59,
there
has
been
a
tax.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
well
--
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
i
gave
you
a
figure,
now
i
start
thinking
clearly
about
it.
i
gave
a
figure
which
would
be
reduced
some
by
what
i
presume
would
be
a
correlative
adjustment
and
i
do
not
know
what
the
net
would
be.
i
would
--
we
have
not
even
studied
that,
yes.
hopefully
--
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
are
they
ever,
yes.
mr.
stephen
h.
anderson
thank
you.
