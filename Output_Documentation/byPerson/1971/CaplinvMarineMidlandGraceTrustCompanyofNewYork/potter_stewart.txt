stewart
but
in
the
federal
court
wouldn't
rule
of
23
govern
it
that
it
was
a
class
action?
justice
potter
stewart
trust
indenture
act
of
1939,
couldn’t
he?
justice
potter
stewart
where
is
this
in
the
documents
before
us?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
in
addition
to
the
clarke
case
in
the
second
circuit,
there
is
the
manhattan
company
against
kelby
a
couple
of
years
later,
decided
unanimously
with
judge
gerald
frank
writing
the
opinion.
justice
potter
stewart
that
too
is
against
you,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
you
could
carry
today,
prudence
past
that
there
was
a
reece.
justice
potter
stewart
and
those
were
bonds,
they
were
not
debentures.
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
the
difference.
in
bonds
there
is
property
pledged
and
you
are
secured
and
in
debentures,
all
you
have
is
covenants.
that’s
the
difference
between
the
two.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
that
it
is
conceded
at
least
here
that
the
trust
indenture
qualified
under
the
--
this
trust
indenture
qualified
under
the
1938
act
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
that's
your
point,
but
you
are
further
saying
that
the
bond
holders
themselves
could
not
rely
on
the
trust
indenture
act
for
federal
jurisdiction?
justice
potter
stewart
alright,
i
thought
someone
in
the
course
of
judge
friendly’s
opinion
in
this
case,
he
suggested
by
way
of
perhaps
a
casual
victim
that
debenture
holders
could
rely
on
the
1939
act.
justice
potter
stewart
(voice

claims
were
decided.
justice
potter
stewart
alright,
thank
you.
justice

(voice

unsecured
debentures,
secured
against
by
convents?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
here,
there
has
been
a
plan,
hasn’t
there?
justice
potter
stewart
before
the
court
and
it
provides
for
what,
four
cents
on
a
dollar?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
whether
or
not
marine
midland
would
be
subrogated
is
not
an
issue
on
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
in
my
brother
white's
hypothetical
case
you
could
show
a
situation
where
the
debtor
was
right,
if
they
got
a
negligent
appraisal
and
then
made
some
sort
of
a
corporate
decision
based,
clearly
based
on
that
appraisal
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
caused
some
damages.
if
they
can
prove
that,
there
would
be
a
cause
of
action
by
the
corporation,
and
therefore,
by
trustee
under
chapter
x?
justice
potter
stewart
the
amount
of
proven
damages?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
showing
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
will
you
do
about
the
collateral
estoppel
with
respect
as
among
individual
bond
--
debenture
holders
who
do
not
bring
class
actions?
justice
potter
stewart
just
as
among,
let
us
say
there
is
an
individual
plaintiff
who
does
not
purport
to
bring
a
class
action?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
he
loses,
there
is
no
collateral
estoppel
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
any
other
area?
justice
potter
stewart
according
to
argument
he
is
suing
as
kind
of
an
ombudsman
as
in
charge
of
the
whole,
all
the
contraries
of
interests
in
the
corporate
reorganization?
justice
potter
stewart
and
belonging
to
somebody
else,
that
is
the
problem.
