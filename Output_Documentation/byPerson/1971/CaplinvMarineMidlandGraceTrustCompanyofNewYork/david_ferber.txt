mr.
david
ferber
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
chapter
x
of
the
bankruptcy
act
is
one
of
the
series
of
securities
laws
passed
during
and
right
after
the
great
depression
to
protect
the
investing
public.
the
commission
study
that
led
to
it
and
to
the
trust
indenture
act
showed
that
in
earlier
reorganizations,
generally
in
equity
receiverships,
the
investors'
interests
were
often
sacrificed
to
the
interests
of
the
insiders
throughout
and
after
the
reorganization,
it
was
the
insiders
who
were
usually
in
control
and
stayed
in
control.
and
the
persons
who
may
have
been
responsible
for
the
difficulties
that
we
have
encountered
were
rarely
if
ever
sued.
and
the
sec
concluded
its
study
with
the
recommendation
to
curb
“the
exploitation
of
investors,
which
has
occurred
either
at
the
hands
of
the
indenture
trustee
itself
or
at
the
hands
of
the
reorganization
and
management
groups
with
the
knowledge,
consent
or
acquiesce
of
the
complacent
and
inactive
trustee
--
indenture
trustee.
and
as
this
court
has
pointed
out
with
respect
to
others
of
the
securities
laws,
we
submit
the
chapter
x
too
should
be
construed
in
the
language
of
this
court
not
technically
and
restrictively,
but
rather
flexibly
to
effectuate
its
remedial
purpose.
now,
what
was
the
remedial
purpose
of
chapter
x?
essentially,
it
was
to
provide
the
means
for
corporate
rehabilitation
that
would
ensure
that
investors'
losses
would
be
kept
to
a
minimum
and
that
the
insiders,
if
responsible,
would
be
prosecuted
and
investors
would
be
treated
fairly
and
this
interested
trustee,
the
court’s
own
officer
was
basic
to
the
statutory
design.
the
house
report
pointed
out
that
his
functions
“in
the
larger
cases”
are
difficult
to
over
emphasize.
under
section
167
of
the
act,
he
is
to
conduct
an
investigation
to
determine
whether
going
concerned
values
can
be
preserved
by
a
reorganization,
to
determine
what
causes
the
difficulties
and
whether
new
management
should
be
required
and
what
causes
of
action
are
available
to
the
estate.
now,
the
respondent's
brief
makes
quite
a
bit
of
this
that
its
causes
of
actions
available
to
the
estate
in
section
167.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
this
is
not
as
clear
a
word
as
the
respondent
suggests.
it
doesn’t
say,
what
causes
of
action
are
available
to
the
debtor,
which
is
defined
in
the
act,
but
uses
the
fairly
vague
word
to
the
estate
and
we
suggest
that
this
word
can
encompass
the
investors
who
are
interested
in
the
debtor.
the
legislative
history
makes
clear
that
a
chapter
x
debtor
was
to
be
viewed
not
just
as
a
corporate
entity,
but
as
a
collection
of
the
interest
of
security
holders.
in
the
sense
that
chapter
x
trustee
represents
all
of
this
security
holders
even
when
various
classes
of
them
may
have
somewhat
conflicting
interests
when
he
works
out
a
reorganization
plan
that
is
to
be
fair
to
all.
obviously,
what
may
be
--
what
“one
group”
might
consider
fair
to
it
and
other
group
might
consider
as
less
than
fear
to
it
because
there
is
only
so
much
normally
to
go
around.
when
he
brings
an
action
on
behalf
of
the
estate,
meaning
strictly
the
debtor,
it
may
help
one
class
to
the
possible
expense
of
the
other.
one
of
the
landmark
cases
is
a
committee
against
kent
in
the
central
states
reorganization
where
the
chapter
x
trustee
wanted
to
determine
that
while
there
was
a
cause
of
action
against
some
of
the
promoters,
he
felt
the
statute
of
limitations
had
run,
and
therefore,
recommended
that
an
action
would
not
be
brought.
on
appeal
it
was
determined
that
an
action
should
be
brought
despite
the
fact
that
the
senior
creditors
opposed
it
because
as
they
said,
you
are
going
to
use
some
of
what
would
otherwise
go
to
worst
to
gamble
for
the
benefit
of
juniors.
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
in
the
committee
against
kent
has
said
that,
“this
is
the
basic
duty
of
the
chapter
x
trustee
where
it
is
a
comparatively
small
amount
of
money
as
against
what
might
be
recovered
to
collect
these
assets
and
determine
that
the
lawsuit
should
be
brought.
similarly,
as
was
made
clear
to
this
court
a
couple
of
years
ago
in
the
tmt
case,
protective
committee
against
anderson,
there
were
settlements
involved
of
large
claims
and
these
settlements
were
of
such
a
nature
that
in
effect
they
were
wiping
out
the
junior
class
whereas
in
this
court
reversed
apparently
because
of
that
i
believe
that
there
had
not
been
an
ample
determination
on
the
fairness
of
these
settlements,
which
if
settled
at
the
substantial
prices
the
debtor
was
allowing
them
would
have
pretty
much
wiped
out
stockholders.
now,
there
are
various
safeguards
in
chapter
x
for
all
of
the
investors.
creditors
and
stockholders
are
entitled
to
be
heard
at
every
stage
of
the
proceeding.
they
could
have
come
in.
i
don’t
know
whether
they
did
or
not
in
this
case,
when
the
trustee
asked
leave
to
sue.
but
certainly,
there
was
no
reason
why
any
creditor,
any
debenture
holder
who
felt
that
the
trustee
should
not
be
suing
on
his
behalf
could
not
have
come
in
and
raised
that
question.
they
are
represented
by
committees
in
many
cases
and
also
in
many
cases
by
the
indenture
trustee.
chapter
x
court
has
very
specific
powers
only
the
security
holders’
representatives.
it
may
enforce
an
accounting
under
a
trust
indenture
or
with
respect
to
security
holder’s
committee.
it
allows
compensation
for
services
performed
during
the
proceeding
by
indenture
trustees
and
by
committees.
to
us,
it
seems
that
it
makes
a
great
deal
of
sense
to
have
the
chapter
x
trustee,
who
has
investigated
and
found
out
the
facts
indicating
that
the
indenture
trustee
might
be
liable.
and
who
would
use
those
facts
as
a
defense
against
the
indenture
trustees'
claim
for
services,
against
the
debtor
for
him
to
bring
the
proceeding
on
behalf
of
the
debenture
holders.
mr.
david
ferber
well,
judge
friendly
states
that
marine
midland
would
then
be
subrogated
--
mr.
david
ferber
without
question,
but
if
there
were
subrogation,
presumably
it
would
not
directly
benefit
the
other
creditors,
but
there
might
be
the
indirect
consequences
of
working
out
an
overall
reorganization
that
was
mentioned.
mr.
david
ferber
well,
i
think
that
basically,
the
contract
was
between
the
indenture
trustee
while
the
debtor
was
a
part
of
the
contract,
but
it
was
for
the
benefit
of
the
debenture
holders.
the
covenants
that
marine
midland
is
alleged
to
have
violated
were
for
the
benefit
of
the
people
who
were
buying
the
debentures.(voice
overlap)
mr.
david
ferber
i
think
without
question
that
that
was
the
purpose
of
them.
now
when
you
get
to
and
i
am
not
suggesting
that
anyone
else
would
have
a
claim
against
marine
midland,
but
from
the
standpoint
of
subrogation,
which
is
an
equitable
remedy,
i
can
see
where
there
could
be
circumstances
perhaps
where
other
people
might
say,
“we
relied
upon
marine
midland
not
to
let
this
assets
get
out
of
two
to
one
ratio”
and
therefore,
it
is
not
fair
that
they
be
share
with
us
in
what
is
left
in
a
matter
of
subrogation.
i
am
not
urging
that,
i
am
saying
there
is
a
question.
mr.
david
ferber
yes.
mr.
david
ferber
well,
if
you
look
at
in
a
very
broad
sense
perhaps
as
i
understand
the
facts
in
that
case,
the
promoters
sold
property
to
the
debtor
at
a
great
deal
less,
i
mean,
at
a
great
deal
more
than
it
was
probably
worth,
they
had
it
what
appears
to
be
a
phony
assessment
and
the
promoters
received
these
bonds,
which
they
in
turn
sold
to
the
public
that
the
money
coming
to
the
bonds,
i
do
not
believe
directly
ever
went
to
the
debtor.
so
i
think
while
judge
cardozo
loosely
spoke
of
it
as
property
of
the
debtor,
as
a
practical
matter,
it
was
the
profits
of
these
promoters
in
the
sale
of
bonds
that
they
had
taken
for
their
sale
of
property
to
the
debtor.
now,
i
am
maybe
over
simplifying,
but
i
read
it
again
last
night,
the
facts
are
not
easy,
but
this
is
the
way
i
believe
what
is
really
involved.
the
promoters
would
have
urged,
it
was
their
property,
not
property
of
the
debtor
and
there
of
course,
the
court
did
holds
that
the
creditors,
that
the
receiver
could
sue
on
behalf
of
the
creditors
and
in
that
connection
justice
white,
i
think
that
in
the
statutory
language
your
read
a
bit
ago,
i
believe
they
were
only
identifying
the
person.
in
other
words,
i
do
not
think
the
language
of
the
property
of
the
debtor
was
intended
in
any
way
to
be
restrictive
and
this
is
the
way
i
read
it
and
i
think
it
is
a
very
logical
way
to
read
it.
i
mean,
this
is
what
the
trustee
was
identified
as,
receiver
was
identified
as.
mr.
david
ferber
yes.
mr.
david
ferber
no,
i
believe
that
case
was
--
well,
there
may
have
been
some
language
that
made
it
clear
that
in
that
case,
they
felt
they
were
collecting
the
reits,
but
as
i
recall,
that
case
did
not
turned
down
any
action
on
the
part
of
the
indenture
trustee.
i
maybe
wrong,
but
that
is
my
recollection
while
even
learned
hand
in
the
later
cases,
i
mean,
to
persuade
his
brethren
perhaps,
always
attempted
to
find
a
reits
even
though
he
had
said
in
the
earlier
case
it
was
not
necessary
but
i
--
mr.
david
ferber
in
the
prudence
case
(voice
overlap)
mr.
david
ferber
that’s
right.
mr.
david
ferber
but
as
a
practical
matter,
in
the
solar
case
for
example,
among
certain
of
the
property
that
got
away
as
it
were
was
when
the
chicago
plant
of
solar
had
been
sold
and
the
indenture
trustee
took
the
money
and
then
put
it
into
the
debtors'
general
account
and
let
the
debtor
get
rid
of
it.
now,
getting
back
this
money
was
seems
to
me
no
difference
in
essence,
then
the
funds,
the
assets
that
got
away
here
because
the
indenture
trustees
had
not
enforced
its
covenant.
mr.
david
ferber
well,
the
claim
is
made
in
the
complaint
that
by
reason
of
this,
the
debtors
assets
ultimately
were
dissipated
and
that
this
is
what
forced
the
debtor
into
receivership.
mr.
david
ferber
just
as
in
the
solar
case,
your
honor,
the
debtors
assets
were
dissipated
by
the
debtor
when
the
marine
midland,
the
same
defendant
by
the
way,
let
the
debtor
have
--
use
of
it.
mr.
david
ferber
thank
you.
mr.
david
ferber
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
chapter
x
of
the
bankruptcy
act
is
one
of
the
series
of
securities
laws
passed
during
and
right
after
the
great
depression
to
protect
the
investing
public.
the
commission
study
that
led
to
it
and
to
the
trust
indenture
act
showed
that
in
earlier
reorganizations,
generally
in
equity
receiverships,
the
investors'
interests
were
often
sacrificed
to
the
interests
of
the
insiders
throughout
and
after
the
reorganization,
it
was
the
insiders
who
were
usually
in
control
and
stayed
in
control.
and
the
persons
who
may
have
been
responsible
for
the
difficulties
that
we
have
encountered
were
rarely
if
ever
sued.
and
the
sec
concluded
its
study
with
the
recommendation
to
curb
“the
exploitation
of
investors,
which
has
occurred
either
at
the
hands
of
the
indenture
trustee
itself
or
at
the
hands
of
the
reorganization
and
management
groups
with
the
knowledge,
consent
or
acquiesce
of
the
complacent
and
inactive
trustee
--
indenture
trustee.
and
as
this
court
has
pointed
out
with
respect
to
others
of
the
securities
laws,
we
submit
the
chapter
x
too
should
be
construed
in
the
language
of
this
court
not
technically
and
restrictively,
but
rather
flexibly
to
effectuate
its
remedial
purpose.
now,
what
was
the
remedial
purpose
of
chapter
x?
essentially,
it
was
to
provide
the
means
for
corporate
rehabilitation
that
would
ensure
that
investors'
losses
would
be
kept
to
a
minimum
and
that
the
insiders,
if
responsible,
would
be
prosecuted
and
investors
would
be
treated
fairly
and
this
interested
trustee,
the
court’s
own
officer
was
basic
to
the
statutory
design.
the
house
report
pointed
out
that
his
functions
“in
the
larger
cases”
are
difficult
to
over
emphasize.
under
section
167
of
the
act,
he
is
to
conduct
an
investigation
to
determine
whether
going
concerned
values
can
be
preserved

to
determine
what
causes
the
difficulties
and
whether
new
management
should
be
required
and
what
causes
of
action
are
available
to
the
estate.
now,
the
respondent's
brief
makes
quite
a
bit
of
this
that
its
causes
of
actions
available
to
the
estate
in
section
167.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
this
is
not
as
clear
a
word
as
the
respondent
suggests.
it
doesn’t
say,
what
causes
of
action
are
available
to
the
debtor,
which
is
defined
in
the
act,
but
uses
the
fairly
vague
word
to
the
estate
and
we
suggest
that
this
word
can
encompass
the
investors
who
are
interested
in
the
debtor.
the
legislative
history
makes
clear
that
a
chapter
x
debtor
was
to
be
viewed
not
just
as
a
corporate
entity,
but
as
a
collection
of

in
the
sense
that
chapter

represents
all

even
when
various

of
them
may
have
somewhat

one
of

is
a
committee
against
kent
in
the
central

reorganization
where
the
chapter

wanted
to

that
while
there
was
a

of

against
some

the
promoters,
he
felt
the

and
therefore,
recommended
that
an
action
would
not

on
appeal
it
was
determined
that
an

should
be
brought
despite
the
fact
that
the
senior

but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth

in
the
committee
against
kent
has
said
that,
“this
is
the
basic

which
if

substantial

the

would
have
pretty
much
wiped
out
stockholders.
now,
there
are
various
safeguards
in
chapter
x
for
all
of
the
investors.
creditors
and
stockholders
are
entitled
to
be

proceeding.
they
could
have
come
in.
i
don’t
know
whether
they
did
or
not
in
this
case,
when
the
trustee
asked
leave
to
sue.
but
certainly,
there
was
no
reason
why
any
creditor,
any
debenture
holder
who
felt
that
the
trustee
should
not
be
suing
on
his
behalf
could
not
have
come
in
and
raised
that
question.
they
are
represented
by
committees
in
many
cases
and
also
in
many
cases
by
the
indenture
trustee.
chapter
x
court
has
very
specific
powers
only
the
security
holders’
representatives.
it
may
enforce
an
accounting
under
a
trust
indenture
or
with
respect
to
security
holder’s
committee.
it
allows
compensation
for
services
performed
during
the
proceeding
by
indenture
trustees
and
by
committees.
to
us,
it
seems
that
it
makes
a
great
deal
of
sense
to
have
the
chapter
x
trustee,
who
has
investigated
and
found
out
the
facts
indicating
that
the
indenture
trustee
might
be
liable.
and
who
would
use
those
facts
as
a
defense
against
the
indenture
trustees'
claim
for
services,
against
the
debtor
for
him
to
bring
the
proceeding
on
behalf
of
the
debenture
holders.
mr.
david
ferber
well,
judge
friendly
states
that
marine
midland
would
then
be
subrogated
--
mr.
david
ferber
without
question,
but
if
there
were
subrogation,
presumably
it
would
not
directly
benefit
the
other
creditors,
but
there
might
be
the
indirect
consequences
of
working
out
an
overall
reorganization
that
was
mentioned.
mr.
david
ferber
well,
i
think
that
basically,
the
contract
was
between
the
indenture
trustee
while
the
debtor
was
a
part
of
the
contract,
but
it
was
for
the
benefit
of
the
debenture
holders.
the
covenants
that
marine
midland
is
alleged
to
have
violated
were
for
the
benefit
of
the
people
who
were
buying
the
debentures.(voice
overlap)
mr.
david
ferber
i
think
without
question
that
that
was
the
purpose
of
them.
now
when
you
get
to
and
i
am
not
suggesting
that
anyone
else
would
have
a
claim
against
marine
midland,
but
from
the
standpoint
of
subrogation,
which
is
an
equitable
remedy,
i
can
see
where
there
could
be
circumstances
perhaps
where
other
people
might
say,
“we
relied
upon
marine
midland
not
to
let
this
assets
get
out
of
two
to
one
ratio”
and
therefore,
it
is
not
fair
that
they
be
share
with
us
in
what
is
left
in
a
matter
of
subrogation.
i
am
not
urging
that,
i
am
saying
there
is
a
question.
mr.
david
ferber
yes.
mr.
david
ferber
well,
if
you
look
at
in
a
very
broad
sense
perhaps
as
i
understand
the
facts
in
that
case,
the
promoters
sold
property
to
the
debtor
at
a
great
deal
less,
i
mean,
at
a
great
deal
more
than
it
was
probably
worth,
they
had
it
what
appears
to
be
a
phony
assessment
and
the
promoters
received
these
bonds,
which
they
in
turn
sold
to
the
public
that
the
money
coming
to
the
bonds,
i
do
not
believe
directly
ever
went
to
the
debtor.
so
i
think
while
judge
cardozo
loosely
spoke
of
it
as
property
of
the
debtor,
as
a
practical
matter,
it
was
the
profits
of
these
promoters
in
the
sale
of
bonds
that
they
had
taken
for
their
sale
of
property
to
the
debtor.
now,
i
am
maybe
over
simplifying,
but
i
read
it
again
last
night,
the
facts
are
not
easy,
but
this
is
the
way
i
believe
what
is
really
involved.
the
promoters
would
have
urged,
it
was
their
property,
not
property
of
the
debtor
and
there
of
course,
the
court
did
holds
that
the
creditors,
that
the
receiver
could
sue
on
behalf
of
the
creditors
and
in
that
connection
justice
white,
i
think
that
in
the
statutory
language
your
read
a
bit
ago,
i
believe
they
were
only
identifying
the
person.
in
other
words,
i
do
not
think
the
language
of
the
property
of
the
debtor
was
intended
in
any
way
to
be
restrictive
and
this
is
the
way
i
read
it
and
i
think
it
is
a
very
logical
way
to
read
it.
i
mean,
this
is
what
the
trustee
was
identified
as,
receiver
was
identified
as.
mr.
david
ferber
yes.
mr.
david
ferber
no,
i
believe
that
case
was
--
well,
there
may
have
been
some
language
that
made
it
clear
that
in
that
case,
they
felt
they
were
collecting
the
reits,
but
as
i
recall,
that
case
did
not
turned
down
any
action
on
the
part
of
the
indenture
trustee.
i
maybe
wrong,
but
that
is
my
recollection
while
even
learned
hand
in
the
later
cases,
i
mean,
to
persuade
his
brethren
perhaps,
always
attempted
to
find
a
reits
even
though
he
had
said
in
the
earlier
case
it
was
not
necessary
but
i
--
mr.
david
ferber
in
the
prudence
case
(voice
overlap)
mr.
david
ferber
that’s
right.
mr.
david
ferber
but
as
a
practical
matter,
in
the
solar
case
for
example,
among
certain
of
the
property
that
got
away
as
it
were
was
when
the
chicago
plant
of
solar
had
been
sold
and
the
indenture
trustee
took
the
money
and
then
put
it
into
the
debtors'
general
account
and
let
the
debtor
get
rid
of
it.
now,
getting
back
this
money
was
seems
to
me
no
difference
in
essence,
then
the
funds,
the
assets
that
got
away
here
because
the
indenture
trustees
had
not
enforced
its
covenant.
mr.
david
ferber
well,
the
claim
is
made
in
the
complaint
that
by
reason
of
this,
the
debtors
assets
ultimately
were
dissipated
and
that
this
is
what
forced
the
debtor
into
receivership.
mr.
david
ferber
just
as
in
the
solar
case,
your
honor,
the
debtors
assets
were
dissipated
by
the
debtor
when
the
marine
midland,
the
same
defendant
by
the
way,
let
the
debtor
have
--
use
of
it.
mr.
david
ferber
thank
you.
