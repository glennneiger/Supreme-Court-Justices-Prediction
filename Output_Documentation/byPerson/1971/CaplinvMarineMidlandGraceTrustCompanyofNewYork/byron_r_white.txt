of
debenture

justice
byron
r.
white
the
state
was
insolvent,
was
it
not?
justice
byron

white
so
the
only
remaining
people
in
the
interest
with
creditors,
secured
or
insecure?
justice
byron

yes,
and
so,
once
the

provides
for

then
the
unsecured

is
left

debenture

justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
sir.
we
are
focusing
mr.
justice
rehnquist
only
on
the
power
of
the
chapter
x
reorganization
trustees.
now,
we
say
third
that
as
a
practical
matter,
the
reorganization
trustee
is
the
best
person
to
bring
this
action.
he
is
the
best
person
because
he
has
under
the
authority,
indeed
under
his
duty,
make
a
total
investigation
of
all
of
the
facts
and
circumstances
leading
to
the
debtors
demise.
he
is
the
person
before
the
reorganization
court.
he
has
found
these
facts.
in
many
instances,
he
has
to
prosecute
a
claim
against
others,
directors
and
officers
of
the
debtor,
which
involved
the
same
facts
and
the
same
circumstances
and
this
action
has
not
brought
either
or
it
may
not
be
bringable
at
all
or
it
will
involve
redundancy
of
fact
finding
as
judge
kaufman
held
below.
finally,
we
say
that
the
holding
of
the
court
below
in
which
a
kind
of
hyper-technical
property
distinction
or
property
holding
has
been
super
imposed
on
the
reorganization
laws,
is
just
plain
wrong.
there
is
no
need
for
that
decision
under
clarke.
there
is
a
decision
in
the
third
circuit,
solar
electric
under
which
this
action
--
this
type
of
action
was
in
effect,
permitted
to
be
brought
as
a
counter
claim
by
the
trustee
to
the
proof
of
claim
and
the
accounting
filed
by
the
indenture
trustee.
we
tried
in
this
case
to
do
it
on
the
all
three
methods
that
is
a
plainary
action,
a
counter
claim
to
a
proof
of
claim
filed
by
the
indenture
trustee
and
also
we
sought
to
have
the
indenture
trustee
file
an
accounting
so
that
we
could
then
counter
claim
and
all
three
of
our
rights
to
do
so,
were
denied
by
the
court’s
below.
we
are
allowed,
however,
under
the
ruling
of
all
the
courts
below
to
setup
as
an
affirmative
defense
to
the
indenture
trustees’
proof
of
claim.
this
affirmative
defense
that
the
indenture
trustee
was
guilty
of
gross
negligence
or
willful
misconduct.
so
we
have
to
find
the
same
facts
and
why
we
can't
bring
it
affirmatively
is
one
of
the
questions
that
this
here
before
this
court.
now,
there
are
two
arguments,
which
are
raised
by
marine
midland
in
this
case,
which
i
would
like
to
address
my
attention
to
it
very
briefly.
in
the
first
argument,
marine
midland
tells
the
court
about
three
individual
cases
which
have
been
brought
on
behalf
of
debenture
holders;
two
in
the
state
court
in
new
york
and
one
in
the
federal
court
in
new
york
and
he
says
in
effect,
“you
see,
the
debenture
holders
were
represented
in
this
case
and
there
is
not
need
for
this
case.
what
the
trustee
is
attempting
to
do
is
to
preempt
the
debenture
holders.”
now,
the
facts
are,
as
we
set
out
in
our
reply
brief,
that
each
of
these
actions
was
commenced
after
the
trustee,
the
reorganization
trustee,
filed
the
petition
seeking
leave
to
bring
this
action,
after
he
has
had
ascertained
all
the
facts
and
after
marine
midland
had
indeed
interposed
an
objection.
in
fact,
nothing
has
happened
in
any
of
those
actions
because
they
are
also
are
sitting
there,
waiting
for
the
result
of
this
court
and
this
action
because
marine
has
moved
to
dismiss
them
on
the
grounds
that
there
is
no
class
action
as
a
matter
of
right
under
new
york
law
for
debenture
holders
--
holding
of
the
appellate
division
of
the
first
department
in
new
york,
which
appears
to
still
be
the
law
although
the
question
is
now
on
appeal.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
is
the
brief
basis
that
talks
about
the
powers
over
the
property
of
the
debtor
and
i
take
it
you
don't
think
you
should
have
to
prove
that
this
promise
of
marine
midland
was
the
property
of
the
debtor?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
is
what
the
statute
says
though,
isn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
trustee
were
allowed
to
sue
and
recover
the
full
face
amount
of
the
debentures
from
midland
and
assume
that
for
the
moment
of
that
entire
recovery
would
go
to
debenture
holders.
would
other
creditors
can
get
more
than
they
would
get
now?
justice
byron

white
if
they
were
not
subrogated,
obviously
they
would
get
more?
justice
byron

now,
let
us
go
back
a
step.
why
is
it
that
a
recovery
against
marine
midland
would
necessarily
go
to
the
debenture
holders
exclusively?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
their
benefit.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
case
is
submitted
on
the
assumption
that
any
recovery
against
the
marine
midland
would
go
exclusively
to
debenture
holders?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let
us
assume
that
they
pay
off
to
the
debenture
holders
and
unsecured
creditors
ten
cents
on
the
dollar
and
the
claim
against
midland
produces
100%
or
are
you
suggesting
that
no
more
could
be
recovered
from
midland
than
90%?
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
and
that
would
be
true
only
if
your
are
right
on
the
subrogation?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
it
depends
on
where
you
start,
if
the
cause
of
action
--
even
though
it
might
in
your
debenture
holders,
the
cause
of
action
is
viewed
as
the
cause
of
action
of
the
estate
for
being
deprived
of
the
ability
to
pay
its
debts.
it
may
come
out
in
a
different
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
are
you
suggesting
that
in
the
plan
of
reorganization
if
--
let
us
assume
for
the
moment
that
before
the
plan
became
final,
a
hundred
percent
--
hundred
cents
on
a
dollar
have
been
recovered
from
marine
midland.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
the
plan
that
the
reorganization
court
would
have
no
power
to
say
that
the
debenture
holders
must
--
if
as
long
as
they
could,
recover
a
hundred
cents
in
the
dollar
from
marine
midland
so
that
other
creditors
would
--

justice

is
that

justice

now,
that

than

at

the

case?
justice

what
if

the
