mr.
charles
h.
miller
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
david
ferber,
the
solicitor
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
and
i
have
divided
our
time
so
that
i
will
take
the
first
30
minutes
and
mr.
ferber,
15
minutes
with
respect
to
the
argument.
mr.
ferber
is
similarly
arguing
for
a
reversal
of
the
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
this
case
is
before
this
court
on
the
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
the
case
involves
the
standing
of
a
bankruptcy
reorganization
trustee,
a
chapter
x
trustee
to
prosecutor
a
claim
in
the
reorganization
proceedings.
i
will
discuss
that
claim
as
i
spell
out
for
the
court
the
facts
with
respect
to
those
matters.
the
courts
below
dismissed
the
trustees’
complaint
and
dismissed
the
other
claims
sought
to
be
prosecuted
by
the
trustee
by
a
way
of
counter
claim
on
the
ground
that
the
trustee
had
no
standing
to
bring
the
claims
which
are
in
question
here.
the
petitioner
in
this
matter
is
mortimer
m.
caplin.
mr.
caplin
was
named
in
may
of
1965
by
the
united
states
district
court,
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
as
the
reorganization
trustee
under
chapter
x
of
webb
&
knapp,
inc.
at
one
time
before
its
troubles,
which
led
webb
&
knapp
into
the
reorganization
court,
that
that
company
was
one
of
the
largest
real
estate
companies
in
the
united
states.
the
defendant
in
this
case
is
the
marine
midland
grace
trust
company
of
new
york.
marine
midland
was
the
trustee
under
a
trust
indenture
with
respect
to
an
issue
of
5%
debentures
of
the
debtor.
there
are
still
approximately
$4,200,000.00
of
these
debentures
outstanding.
in
the
trust
indenture,
a
copy
of
which
has
been
lodged
with
this
court,
there
were
certain
covenants,
which
were
made
by
the
debtor
for
the
benefit
of
the
debenture
holders.
the
single
most
important
covenant
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
was
a
covenant
that
the
debtor
would
not
incur
any
indebtedness
or
purchase
any
real
property,
unless
its
tangible
assets
were
twice
its
liabilities.
that
is
the
section
3.6
of
the
trust
indenture
and
that
provision,
which
we
call
the
asset
to
liability
ratio
provision,
is
at
the
heart
of
this
case.
there
were
certifications
required
by
the
debtor
to
marine
midland,
the
indenture
trustee,
year
after
year
to
the
effect
that
the
debtor
was
not
in
default
in
connection
with
these
debentures.
now,
the
marine
midland
requested
appraisals
with
respect
to
the
value
of
the
real
property
here,
because
the
principal
assets
of
this
corporation
was
real
estate
and
from
year-to-year,
starting
in
or
about
1957
at
least,
the
debtor’s
offices
furnished
the
marine
midland
appraisals
as
to
their
opinion
as
to
the
value
of
the
real
property.
this
was
all
for
purposes
of
this
asset
to
liability
ratio
and
ensuring
that
the
debtor
would
not
purchase
more
real
property
or
incur
more
indebtedness
unless
the
asset
to
liability
ratio
were
indeed
two
to
one
as
the
covenant
provided.
now,
these
certificates
and
these
appraisals,
were
accepted
year
after
year
by
marine
midland
without
any
question
being
raised
at
all.
after
mr.
caplin
was
named
as
reorganization
trustee,
he
commenced
his
statutory
investigation
of
the
debtors’
affairs
under
chapter
x
of
chandler
act
and
he
found
that
the
appraisals
and
that
the
certificates,
submitted
annually
by
the
debtors
directors
and
offices,
were
in
fact
false
and
fraudulent
on
their
face
and
that
marine
midland
knew
or
should
have
known
that
this
appraisals
were
inflated.
he
further
found
that
marine
midland
willfully
disregarded
these
appraisals
and
these
certificates
and
was
grossly
negligent
in
failing
to
recognize
how
false
they
were.
in
fact,
the
trustee
and
reorganization,
mr.
caplin
found
at
no
time
during
the
period
between
1957
and
1965
had
the
required
two
to
one
tangible
asset
to
liability
ratio
have
been
maintained.
we
have
in
the
petitioner's
main
brief
at
page
four,
an
indication
of
one
example
of
the
kind
of
appraisals
about
which
we
are
talking.
there
are
certain
parcel
of
real
property
in
bronx
county
in
new
york.
that
real
property
with
a
net
book
value
of
$2,800,000.00
had
been
appraised
by
the
debtors
offices
at
$15,000,000.00
in
1957,
$27.5
million
in
1958,
one
year
later
in
1959
at
more
than
double
that
amount,
$64
million
and
the
same
in
1960.
and
by
1963,
the
same
parcel
without
any
significant
improvements
on
it
have
been
appraised
by
the
debtors
offices
at
--
80%
of
it
had
been
appraised
at
$91
million
so
that
the
whole
parcel
had
to
be
appraised
at
more
than
a
$100
million.
this
is
just
one
example
of
the
kind
of
appraisals
that
were
involved.
now,
as
a
result
of
his
investigation,
the
reorganization
trustee
determined
that
it
was
the
gross
negligence
or
willful
misconduct,
not
simple
negligence
but
gross
or
willful
misconduct,
by
marine
midland,
which
had
permitted
the
debtor
to
continue
this
course
of
activity
or
buying
more
real
estate
and
entering
in
the
transactions
involving
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
and
incurring
more
indebtedness
and
that
this
led
inexorably
to
the
reorganization
court
where
webb
&
knapp
found
itself
in
1965.
indeed,
it
was
charged
by
the
reorganization
trustee,
mr.
caplin
in
that
complaint
which
was
in
question
here
and
which
we
are
seeking
to
have
reinstated
that
it
was
the
bank's
failure
to
enforce
this
two
to
one
asset
to
liability
ration
and
his
failure
by
having
received
and
accepted
without
question
these
appraisals
and
these
certificates
which
were
clearly
false
on
their
face,
which
caused
a
net
worth
of
this
company
to
be
reduced
from
$25
million
in
december
1958
to
a
negative
net
worth,
a
deficit
figure
of
$38.5
million
at
the
time
that
the
reorganization
proceeding
commenced.
mr.
charles
h.
miller
no,
we
are
saying
that
it
ran
for
the
benefit
of
the
debenture
holders,
if
the
court
please,
and
this
action
is
sought
to
be
maintained
by
the
reorganization
trustee
on
behalf
of
the
debenture
holders.
that
is
the
question
before
this
court.
mr.
charles
h.
miller
that
is
correct
and
we
say
--
mr.
charles
h.
miller
the
state
was
insolvent.
mr.
charles
h.
miller
in
fact,
as
things
have
turned
out,
the
only
remaining
people
of
interest
were
general
creditors
after
secured
creditors
(voice
overlap)
mr.
charles
h.
miller
unsecured
creditors
and
debenture
holders
who
are
classed
as
general
preference.
mr.
charles
h.
miller
yes
sir.
now,
the
reorganization
trustee
mr.
caplin,
petitioned
in
the
district
court,
in
the
reorganization
court
for
the
right
to
start
a
plainary
action
against
marine
midland
for
the
benefit
of
debenture
holders
and
the
court
granted
permission
for
mr.
caplin
to
do
so
and
then
on
the
motion
of
marine
midland,
the
court
dismissed
the
complaint
on
the
ground
that
under
second
circuit
(inaudible)
clarke
against
chase
national
bank
in
1943
decision
in
the
second
circuit,
the
reorganization
trustee
had
no
standing
and
was
not
the
real
party
of
interest
and
had
no
standing
to
prosecutor
a
personal
claim
on
behalf
of
debenture
holders.
the
district
court
held
that
it
was
bound
by
the
clarke
decision,
that
the
property
involved
was
acclaimed
personal
to
the
debenture
holders
and
did
not
involve
property
of
the
estate
and
it
also
held
that
it
would
not
affect
a
plan
of
reorganization.
under
clarke,
the
reorganization
trustee
has
the
authority
and
has
standing
to
sue
on
behalf
of
debenture
holders
if
either
property
of
the
debtor
is
involved
or
the
matter
would
affect
the
plan
of
reorganization.
the
district
held
that
it
would
not.
we
then
went
to
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals.
there
was
an
argument
held
before
three
judges.
two
of
the
three
judges
would
have
overruled
the
clarke
decision
and
held
that
the
trustee
had
standing.
the
reorganization
trustee
had
standing,
but
the
second
circuit
in
accordance
with
its
time
honored
rule,
then
submitted
the
matter
en
banc
to
the
full
second
circuit
without
further
argument
on
the
briefs
already
submitted
and
held
with
five
to
two
that
there
was
no
standing
on
behalf
of
the
reorganization
trustee.
the
second
circuit
in
an
opinion
by
judge
friendly,
held
that
the
reorganization
trustee
had
no
standing,
that
clarke
was
the
proper
rule
and
that
there
was
no
reason
for
this
action
to
be
brought
by
the
reorganization
trustee.
there
was
a
vigorous
dissent
by
judges
ervin
kaufman
and
paul
hays
to
the
effect
that
there
was
no
reason
for
the
clarke
rule
and
the
somewhat
artificial
distinctions
with
respect
to
the
property
that
were
involved
in
that
rule.
and
that
the
action
should
have
been
permitted
to
be
brought
that
the
reorganization
trustee
is
indeed
the
proper
party
to
bring
the
action,
he
is
authorized
on
the
statute
to
do
so
and
he
should
have
been
permitted
to
do
so.
now,
we
have
set
forth
in
our
briefs,
four
principle
reasons
why
we
--
for
the
reorganization
trustee
assert
that
there
is
standing
for
the
reorganization
trustee
to
prosecute
this
action
against
marine
midland
on
behalf
of
the
debenture
holders.
the
first
reason
is
that
the
congressional
scheme
for
reorganization,
which
is
evidenced
by
two
significant
statutory
amendments
in
the
late
1930s,
just
two
significant
statutory
enactments;
the
chandler
act,
which
sets
up
chapter
x
and
the
trust
indenture
act
specifically
provide
for
a
reorganization
process
in
which
the
reorganization
trustee
is
the
focal
point
and
is
taking
the
interests
not
just
of
the
debtors,
not
just
of
the
general
creditors,
but
of
the
investors,
stockholders,
debt
investors,
any
kind
of
investors
and
he
is
the
focal
point
for
all
of
this.
he
investigates
and
he
tries
to
find
out
what
happened
that
led
the
debtor
into
the
reorganization
court.
he
is
then
the
proper
party
under
the
statute
to
prosecute
any
claims,
which
may
exist
against
third
parties
or
against
anybody
else
because
without
his
intersession,
it
is
quite
likely
that
in
many
instances
at
least
the
debenture
holders
will
not
prosecute
their
individual
claims
because
many
of
them
may
in
certain
instances
have
small
face
amounts
of
debentures
and
they
will
not
undergo
the
expense
of
prosecuting
their
own
claims.
we
say
that
in
addition
to
that,
secondly,
there
is
specific
statutory
authority
under
the
bankruptcy
laws,
under
chapter
x
for
a
reorganization
trustee
to
sue
a
venture
trustee
and
the
kind
of
claim
involved
here.
and
we
point
to
section
587
of
title
11,
which
we
set
forth
at
our
grief
at
page
14,
which
specifically
holds
that
an
equity
receiver
that
a
reorganization
trustee
has
all
the
powers
of
an
equity
receiver.
now,
when
equity
receiver,
under
this
court’s
decision
in
the
mccandless
case
in
1935,
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
cardozo
held
that
an
equity
receiver
could
sue
third
parties
to
--
in
affect
return
funds
or
have
funds
restored
to
the
estate
on
behalf
of
investors.
mr.
charles
h.
miller
yes,
i
think
rule
of
23
would
govern
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
i
think
that
the
question
is
not
as
marine
midland
has
attempted
to
frame
it
whether
the
trustee
is
preempting
the
individual
rights
of
debenture
holders.
there
has
been
no
such
claim
here
by
the
trustee
or
as
i
understand
it
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission,
and
the
argument
i
was
addressing
myself
to
was
the
one
of
exclusivity
or
preemption.
we
are
not
saying
that
if
the
debenture
holder
wants
to
bring
his
own
action,
he
may
not
do
so.
the
matters
may
then
be
consolidated
before
the
district
court
of
they
may
not
be.
what
i
am
talking
about
and
what
this
case
is
about
is
the
pure
issue
of
standing,
whether
the
reorganization
trustee
can
bring
the
case.
mr.
charles
h.
miller
yes,
i
believe
it
would.
no,
i
will
withdraw
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
there
is
a
foot
note
--
mr.
charles
h.
miller
trust
indenture
act
of
1939,
section
315,
which
judge
friendly
in
the
second
circuit
alluded
to
in
a
foot
note
in
his
opinion
saying,
“yes,
there
is
a
private
right
of
action
under
315.”
now,
what
we
are
saying
however
is
that,
as
a
practical
matter
and
as
a
matter
of
the
statutory
purpose,
there
was
a
feeling
in
congress
that
debenture
holders
would
not
have
the
wherewithal
or
the
ability
to
bring
this
kind
of
action
and
the
reorganization
trustee
is
the
proper
party
to
do
it.
now,
one
other
argument
that
has
been
raised
by
marine
midland
to
which
i
would
like
to
address
myself
is,
the
marine
midland
argument,
that
you
go
down
the
statute
at
chapter
x
and
you
read
it
line
by
line
by
line
and
nowhere
do
you
see
any
specific
authority
for
a
reorganization
trustee
to
sue
an
indenture
trustee
on
behalf
of
behalf
of
debenture
holders.
now,
marine
midland
would
have
this
court
look
at
a
reorganization
trustee
and
i
think
that
this
mr.
justice
rehnquist
is
in
part
answer
to
your
question.
not
as
a
--
marine
midland
would
have
us
look
at
a
reorganization
trustee
as
a
liquidator
of
assets.
somebody
who
goes
out
and
looks
at
the
statute
as
also
checklist
and
goes
out
and
gets
whatever
property
is
involved
there
and
brings
whatever
suits
are
specifically
set
forth
there.
that
is
not,
we
say
what
a
reorganization
trustee
is
all
about
and
i
think
that
judge
irving
kaufman
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
said
it
better
than
i
am
able
to
say
it.
he
said
that
the
process
of
reorganizing
and
i
am
reading
now
from
the
dissent
in
the
court
of
appeals
at
pages
99a
to
100a
of
the
appendix
in
this
case.
the
process
of
reorganizing
is
not
performed
merely
by
a
nice,
sharp,
precise,
mathematical
apportionment
of
a
debtor’s
estate
according
to
fixed
formulas.
rather,
the
objective
is
carried
out
through
a
process
of
negotiation
and
some
give
and
take
in
an
attempt
to
adjust
equitably
and
with
sensitivity
to
nuances
of
the
individual
case,
the
rights
of
competing
interested
parties.
and
then
judge
kaufman
pointed
to
the
language,
which
was
a
little
more
thrust
as
it
usually
was
of
judge
learned
hand
in
the
second
circuit
in
his
quite
vigorous
dissent
in
the
clarke
case
with
which
we
are
in
whole
hearted
agreement.
judge
learned
hand
said,
“the
reorganization
court
has
jurisdiction
because
it
has
an
obligation
to
“adjust”
the
mutual
rights
of
the
debtors'
creditors
as
between
themselves.”
now,
we
think
that
the
efforts
of
marine
midland
to
super
impose
this
state
law
property
concept
over
what
congress
has
enacted
as
the
policy
in
reorganization.
it
should
be
the
policy
in
reorganization
is
one,
which
this
court
should
not
countenance.
we
say
further
that
if
you
are
looking
to
the
statute
for
a
specific
statutory
authority
that
a
reorganization
trustee
has
all
of
the
powers
of
a
receiver
in
equity.
mr.
charles
h.
miller
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
h.
miller
well,
what
we
are
saying
mr.
justice
rehnquist
is
that,
the
second
injunctive
portion
of
that
section
587.
mr.
charles
h.
miller
this
is
at
page
35
of
our
main
brief
at
appendix
a.
mr.
charles
h.
miller
that
is
the
language
that
reads,
“and
if
authorized
by
the
judge,
shall
have
and
may
exercise
such
additional
rights
and
powers
as
a
receiver
in
equity
would
have
if
appointed
by
a
court
of
the
united
states
for
the
property
of
the
debtor
and
we
say
that
a
receiver
in
equity
under
the
mccandless
case,
could
have
brought
this
action
and
we
can
too,
because
we
have
the
same
powers
as
a
receiver.
mr.
charles
h.
miller
no,
i
believe
that
the
property
concept
mr.
justice
white
does
not
have
a
place
here.
i
think
that
in
--
mr.
charles
h.
miller
well,
before
the
statute
was
enacted,
this
court
in
the
mccandless
case
gave
a
receiver
the
power
--
an
equity
receiver
the
power
to
go
after
assets
from
a
third
party
which
have
not
been
property
of
the
debtor,
but
in
fact,
was
diminution
of
the
value
of
the
debtor
caused
by
wrong
doing
on
the
part
of
insiders,
in
effect
the
equivalent
of
a
insider
wrong
doing.
and
i
say
that
the
property
concept
is
not
a
concept
which
should
control
in
this
court
and
not
should
the
concept
of
whether
or
not
there
happens
to
be
a
class
action
that
was
brought
here.
we
are
not
talking
about
this
case
alone
before
this
court.
we
are
talking
about
the
general
powers
and
the
general
authority
and
the
general
standing
of
a
reorganization
trustee.
we
know
there
are
limits
upon
that.
the
limits
upon
that
are,
that
the
matter
must
have
a
significant
relationship
to
the
reorganization
proceeding
and
i
think
it
clearly
does
here.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
h.
miller
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
suggest
that
the
parade
of
horribles
that
marine
midland
has
suggested
that
would
be
unleashed
if
the
trustee
were
given
standing
in
this
case,
it
just
does
not
exist
and
it
does
not
exist
for
one
reason
and
it
is
a
reason
that
we
assert
as
one
of
the
significant
reasons
why
the
trustee
should
have
standing
in
this
case.
everything
in
the
reorganization
is
under
the
supervision,
and
the
umbrella
and
the
aegis
of
a
reorganization
court.
it
is
under
the
aegis
of
a
reorganization
court,
which
has
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
before
it
at
every
step
in
the
proceeding.
before
any
action
can
be
started
the
reorganization
court
gives
permission
to
the
starting
of
the
action.
before
any
action
can
be
settled,
the
reorganization
court
determines
whether
the
settlement
is
fair
and
equitable
and
the
reorganization
court,
which
makes
that
determination,
does
it
on
the
basis
of
a
long
standing
knowledge
of
all
the
facts
or
circumstances
of
the
debtor's
estates,
of
the
debenture
holders,
of
all
the
various
packages
of
creditor's
rights
which
are
involved
here.
mr.
charles
h.
miller
no,
i
am
not.
now,
in
addition
to
that
--
mr.
charles
h.
miller
if
what,
mr.
justice
white?
i
am
sorry.
mr.
charles
h.
miller
yes,
that
was
--
mr.
charles
h.
miller
yes,
i
believe
that
they
could
have.
what
you
have
in
that
case
in
furtherance
of
your
question
to
mr.
dickey,
and
further
answer
to
it
i
think
was
nothing
more
than
a
chosen
action
and
i
think
you
have
the
same
thing
in
this
case.
perhaps
a
different
kind
of
chosen
action
but
no
different.
mr.
charles
h.
miller
well,
no.
it
belongs
to
the
debenture
holders
and
i
think,
if
i
may
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
is
not
the
problem,
that
is
what
this
case
is
all
about.
the
focus
in
this
case
has
come
to
be
directed
towards
the
estate
and
what
is
happening
with
the
estate.
we
are
talking
now
about
the
debenture
holders
and
the
debenture
holders
alone
and
whether
they
are
entitled
to
this
relief
and
we
are
seeking,
the
reorganization
trustee
is
seeking
to
sue
on
behalf
of
the
debenture
holders.
in
the
solar
case
and
in
the
clarke
case
and
in
prudence
bonds,
all
of
this
cases,
which
are
the
only
ones,
which
have
decided
this
question
for
the
most
part,
there
was
a
recovery
to
the
debenture
holders
on
certain
of
the
claims
allowed.
either
way
there
was
a
trust
reits
involved
or
a
certain
property
involved.
there
was
no
question
there
about
standing
or
affect
on
the
estate
or
subrogation
or
whether
there
would
be
any
of
these
other
matters
in
the
prayer
to
harbals
(ph)
which
have
been
asserted
before
you.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
h.
miller
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
david
ferber,
the
solicitor
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
and
i
have
divided
our
time
so
that
i
will
take
the
first
30
minutes
and
mr.
ferber,
15
minutes
with
respect
to
the
argument.
mr.
ferber
is
similarly
arguing
for
a
reversal
of
the
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
this
case
is
before
this
court
on
the
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
the
case
involves
the
standing
of
a
bankruptcy
reorganization
trustee,
a
chapter
x
trustee
to
prosecutor
a
claim
in
the
reorganization
proceedings.
i
will
discuss
that
claim
as
i
spell
out
for
the
court
the
facts
with
respect
to
those
matters.
the
courts
below
dismissed
the
trustees’
complaint
and
dismissed
the
other
claims
sought
to
be
prosecuted
by
the
trustee
by
a
way
of
counter
claim
on
the
ground
that
the
trustee
had
no
standing
to
bring
the
claims
which
are
in
question
here.
the
petitioner
in
this
matter
is
mortimer
m.
caplin.
mr.
caplin
was
named
in
may
of
1965
by
the
united
states
district
court,
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
as
the
reorganization
trustee
under
chapter
x
of
webb
&
knapp,
inc.
at
one
time
before
its
troubles,
which
led
webb
&
knapp
into
the
reorganization
court,
that
that
company
was
one
of
the
largest
real
estate
companies
in
the
united
states.
the
defendant
in
this
case
is
the
marine
midland
grace
trust
company
of
new
york.
marine
midland
was
the
trustee
under
a
trust
indenture
with
respect
to
an
issue
of
5%
debentures
of
the
debtor.
there
are
still
approximately
$4,200,000.00
of
these
debentures
outstanding.
in
the
trust
indenture,
a
copy
of
which
has
been
lodged
with
this
court,
there
were
certain
covenants,
which
were
made
by
the
debtor
for
the
benefit
of
the
debenture
holders.
the
single
most
important
covenant
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
was
a
covenant
that
the
debtor
would
not
incur
any
indebtedness
or
purchase
any
real
property,
unless
its
tangible
assets
were
twice
its
liabilities.
that
is
the
section
3.6
of
the
trust
indenture
and
that
provision,
which
we
call
the
asset
to
liability
ratio
provision,
is
at
the
heart
of
this
case.
there
were
certifications
required
by
the
debtor
to
marine
midland,
the
indenture
trustee,
year
after
year
to
the
effect
that
the
debtor
was
not
in
default
in
connection
with
these
debentures.
now,
the
marine
midland
requested
appraisals
with
respect
to
the
value
of
the
real
property
here,
because
the
principal
assets
of
this
corporation
was
real
estate
and
from
year-to-year,
starting
in
or
about
1957
at
least,
the
debtor’s
offices
furnished
the
marine
midland
appraisals
as
to
their
opinion
as
to
the
value
of
the
real
property.
this
was
all
for
purposes
of
this
asset
to
liability
ratio
and
ensuring
that
the
debtor
would
not
purchase
more
real
property
or
incur
more
indebtedness
unless
the
asset
to
liability
ratio
were
indeed
two
to
one
as
the
covenant
provided.
now,
these
certificates
and
these
appraisals,
were
accepted
year
after
year
by
marine
midland
without
any
question
being
raised
at
all.
after
mr.
caplin
was
named
as
reorganization
trustee,
he
commenced
his
statutory
investigation
of
the
debtors’
affairs
under
chapter
x
of
chandler
act
and
he
found
that
the
appraisals
and
that
the
certificates,
submitted
annually
by
the
debtors
directors
and
offices,
were
in
fact
false
and
fraudulent
on
their
face
and
that
marine
midland
knew
or
should
have
known
that
this
appraisals
were
inflated.
he
further
found
that
marine
midland
willfully
disregarded
these
appraisals
and
these
certificates
and
was
grossly
negligent
in
failing
to
recognize
how
false
they
were.
in
fact,
the
trustee
and
reorganization,
mr.
caplin
found
at
no
time
during
the
period
between
1957
and
1965
had
the
required
two
to
one
tangible
asset
to
liability
ratio
have
been
maintained.
we
have
in
the
petitioner's
main
brief
at
page
four,
an
indication
of
one
example
of
the
kind
of
appraisals
about
which
we
are
talking.
there
are
certain
parcel
of
real
property
in
bronx
county
in
new
york.
that
real
property
with
a
net
book
value
of
$2,800,000.00
had
been
appraised
by
the
debtors
offices
at
$15,000,000.00
in
1957,
$27.5
million
in
1958,
one
year
later
in
1959
at
more
than
double
that
amount,
$64
million
and
the
same
in
1960.
and
by
1963,
the
same
parcel
without
any
significant
improvements
on
it
have
been
appraised
by
the
debtors
offices
at
--
80%
of
it
had
been
appraised
at
$91
million
so
that
the
whole
parcel
had
to
be
appraised
at
more
than
a
$100
million.
this
is
just
one
example
of
the
kind
of
appraisals
that
were
involved.
now,
as
a
result
of
his
investigation,
the
reorganization
trustee
determined
that
it
was
the
gross
negligence
or
willful
misconduct,
not
simple
negligence
but
gross
or
willful
misconduct,
by
marine
midland,
which
had
permitted
the
debtor
to
continue
this
course
of
activity
or
buying
more
real
estate
and
entering
in
the
transactions
involving
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
and
incurring
more
indebtedness
and
that
this
led
inexorably
to
the
reorganization
court
where
webb
&
knapp
found
itself
in
1965.
indeed,
it
was
charged
by
the
reorganization
trustee,
mr.
caplin
in
that
complaint
which
was
in
question
here
and
which
we
are
seeking
to
have
reinstated
that
it
was
the
bank's
failure
to
enforce
this
two
to
one
asset
to
liability
ration
and
his
failure
by
having
received
and
accepted
without
question
these
appraisals
and
these
certificates
which
were
clearly
false
on
their
face,
which
caused
a
net
worth
of
this
company
to
be
reduced
from
$25
million
in
december
1958
to
a
negative
net
worth,
a
deficit
figure
of
$38.5
million
at
the
time
that
the
reorganization
proceeding
commenced.
mr.
charles
h.
miller
no,
we
are
saying
that
it
ran
for
the
benefit
of
the
debenture
holders,
if
the
court
please,
and
this
action
is
sought
to
be
maintained
by
the
reorganization
trustee
on
behalf
of
the
debenture
holders.
that
is
the
question
before
this
court.
mr.
charles
h.
miller
that
is
correct
and
we
say
--
mr.
charles
h.
miller
the
state
was
insolvent.
mr.
charles
h.
miller
in
fact,
as
things
have
turned
out,
the
only
remaining
people
of
interest
were
general
creditors
after
secured
creditors
(voice
overlap)
mr.
charles
h.
miller
unsecured
creditors
and
debenture
holders
who
are
classed
as
general
preference.
mr.
charles
h.
miller
yes
sir.
now,
the
reorganization
trustee
mr.
caplin,
petitioned
in
the
district
court,
in
the
reorganization
court
for
the
right
to
start
a
plainary
action
against
marine
midland
for
the
benefit
of
debenture
holders
and
the
court
granted
permission
for
mr.
caplin
to
do
so
and
then
on
the
motion
of
marine
midland,
the
court
dismissed
the
complaint
on
the
ground
that
under
second
circuit
(inaudible)
clarke
against
chase
national
bank
in
1943
decision
in
the
second
circuit,
the
reorganization
trustee
had
no
standing
and
was
not
the
real
party
of
interest
and
had
no
standing
to
prosecutor
a
personal
claim
on
behalf
of
debenture
holders.
the
district
court
held
that
it
was
bound
by
the
clarke
decision,
that
the
property
involved
was
acclaimed
personal
to
the
debenture
holders
and
did
not
involve
property
of
the
estate
and
it
also
held
that
it
would
not
affect
a
plan
of
reorganization.
under
clarke,
the
reorganization
trustee
has
the
authority
and
has
standing
to
sue
on
behalf
of
debenture
holders
if
either
property
of
the
debtor
is
involved
or
the
matter
would
affect
the
plan
of
reorganization.
the
district
held
that
it
would
not.
we
then
went
to
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals.
there
was
an
argument
held
before
three
judges.
two
of
the
three
judges
would
have
overruled
the
clarke
decision
and
held
that
the
trustee
had
standing.
the
reorganization
trustee
had
standing,
but
the
second
circuit
in
accordance
with
its
time
honored
rule,
then
submitted
the
matter
en
banc
to
the
full
second
circuit
without
further
argument
on
the
briefs
already
submitted
and
held
with
five
to
two
that
there
was
no
standing
on
behalf
of
the
reorganization
trustee.
the
second
circuit
in
an
opinion
by
judge
friendly,
held
that
the
reorganization
trustee
had
no
standing,
that
clarke
was
the
proper
rule
and
that
there
was
no
reason
for
this
action
to
be
brought
by
the
reorganization
trustee.
there
was
a
vigorous
dissent
by
judges
ervin
kaufman
and
paul
hays
to
the
effect
that
there
was
no
reason
for
the
clarke
rule
and
the
somewhat
artificial
distinctions
with
respect
to
the
property
that
were
involved
in
that
rule.
and
that
the
action
should
have
been
permitted
to
be
brought
that
the
reorganization
trustee
is
indeed
the
proper
party
to
bring
the
action,
he
is
authorized
on
the
statute
to
do
so
and
he
should
have
been
permitted
to
do
so.
now,
we
have
set
forth
in
our
briefs,
four
principle
reasons
why
we
--
for
the
reorganization
trustee
assert
that
there
is
standing
for
the
reorganization
trustee
to
prosecute
this
action
against
marine
midland
on
behalf
of
the
debenture
holders.
the
first
reason
is
that
the
congressional
scheme
for
reorganization,
which
is
evidenced
by
two
significant
statutory
amendments
in
the
late
1930s,
just
two
significant
statutory
enactments;
the
chandler
act,
which
sets
up
chapter
x
and
the
trust
indenture
act
specifically
provide
for
a
reorganization
process
in
which
the
reorganization
trustee
is
the
focal
point
and
is
taking
the
interests
not
just
of
the
debtors,
not
just
of
the
general
creditors,
but
of
the
investors,
stockholders,
debt
investors,
any
kind
of
investors
and
he
is
the
focal
point
for
all
of
this.
he
investigates
and
he
tries
to
find
out
what
happened
that
led
the
debtor
into
the
reorganization
court.
he
is
then
the
proper
party
under
the
statute
to
prosecute
any
claims,
which
may
exist
against
third
parties
or
against
anybody
else
because
without
his
intersession,
it
is
quite
likely
that
in
many
instances
at
least
the
debenture
holders
will
not
prosecute
their
individual
claims
because
many
of
them
may
in
certain
instances
have
small
face
amounts
of
debentures
and
they
will
not
undergo
the
expense
of
prosecuting
their
own
claims.
we
say
that
in
addition
to
that,
secondly,
there
is
specific
statutory
authority
under
the
bankruptcy
laws,
under
chapter
x
for
a
reorganization
trustee
to
sue
a
venture
trustee
and
the
kind
of
claim
involved
here.
and
we
point
to
section
587
of
title
11,
which
we
set
forth
at
our
grief
at
page
14,
which
specifically
holds
that
an
equity
receiver
that
a
reorganization
trustee
has
all
the
powers
of
an
equity
receiver.
now,
when
equity
receiver,
under
this
court’s
decision
in
the
mccandless
case
in
1935,
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
cardozo
held
that
an
equity
receiver
could
sue
third
parties
to
--
in
affect
return
funds
or
have
funds
restored
to
the
estate
on
behalf
of
investors.
mr.
charles
h.
miller
yes,
i
think
rule
of

would
govern
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
i
think
that
the
question
is
not
as
marine
midland
has
attempted
to
frame
it
whether
the
trustee
is
preempting
the
individual
rights
of
debenture
holders.
there
has
been
no
such
claim
here
by
the
trustee
or
as
i
understand
it
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission,
and
the
argument
i
was
addressing
myself
to
was
the
one
of
exclusivity
or
preemption.
we
are
not
saying
that
if
the
debenture
holder
wants
to
bring
his
own
action,
he
may
not
do
so.
the
matters
may
then
be
consolidated
before
the
district
court
of
they
may
not
be.
what
i
am
talking
about
and
what
this
case
is
about
is
the
pure
issue
of
standing,
whether
the
reorganization
trustee
can
bring
the
case.
mr.
charles
h.
miller
yes,
i
believe
it
would.
no,
i
will
withdraw
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
there
is
a
foot
note
--
mr.
charles
h.
miller
trust
indenture
act
of
1939,
section
315,
which
judge
friendly
in
the
second
circuit
alluded
to
in
a
foot
note
in
his
opinion
saying,
“yes,
there
is
a
private
right
of
action
under
315.”
now,
what
we
are
saying
however
is
that,
as
a
practical
matter
and
as
a
matter
of
the
statutory
purpose,
there
was
a
feeling
in
congress
that
debenture
holders
would
not
have
the
wherewithal
or
the
ability
to
bring
this
kind
of
action
and
the
reorganization
trustee
is
the
proper
party
to
do
it.
now,
one
other
argument
that
has
been
raised
by
marine
midland
to
which
i
would
like
to
address
myself
is,
the
marine
midland
argument,
that
you
go
down
the
statute
at
chapter
x
and
you
read
it
line
by
line
by
line
and
nowhere
do
you
see
any
specific
authority
for
a
reorganization
trustee
to
sue
an
indenture
trustee
on
behalf
of
behalf
of
debenture
holders.
now,
marine
midland
would
have
this
court
look
at
a
reorganization
trustee
and
i
think
that
this
mr.
justice
rehnquist
is
in
part
answer
to
your
question.
not
as
a
--
marine
midland
would
have
us
look
at
a
reorganization
trustee
as
a
liquidator
of
assets.
somebody
who
goes
out
and
looks
at
the
statute
as
also
checklist
and
goes
out
and
gets
whatever
property
is
involved
there
and
brings
whatever
suits
are
specifically
set
forth
there.
that
is
not,
we
say
what
a
reorganization
trustee
is
all
about
and
i
think
that
judge
irving
kaufman
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
said
it
better
than
i
am
able
to
say
it.
he
said
that
the
process
of
reorganizing
and
i
am
reading
now
from
the
dissent
in
the
court
of
appeals
at
pages
99a
to
100a
of
the
appendix
in
this
case.
the
process
of
reorganizing
is
not
performed
merely
by
a
nice,
sharp,
precise,
mathematical
apportionment
of
a
debtor’s
estate
according
to
fixed
formulas.
rather,
the
objective
is
carried
out
through
a
process
of
negotiation
and
some
give
and
take
in
an
attempt
to
adjust
equitably
and
with
sensitivity
to
nuances
of
the
individual
case,
the
rights
of
competing
interested
parties.
and
then
judge
kaufman
pointed
to
the
language,
which
was
a
little
more
thrust
as
it
usually
was
of
judge
learned
hand
in
the
second
circuit
in
his
quite
vigorous
dissent
in
the
clarke
case
with
which
we
are
in
whole
hearted
agreement.
judge
learned
hand
said,
“the
reorganization
court
has
jurisdiction
because
it
has
an
obligation
to
“adjust”
the
mutual
rights
of
the
debtors'
creditors
as
between
themselves.”
now,
we
think
that
the
efforts
of
marine
midland
to
super
impose
this
state
law
property
concept
over
what
congress
has
enacted
as
the
policy
in
reorganization.
it
should
be
the
policy
in
reorganization
is
one,
which
this
court
should
not
countenance.
we
say
further
that
if
you
are
looking
to
the
statute
for
a
specific
statutory
authority
that
a
reorganization
trustee
has
all
of
the
powers
of
a
receiver
in
equity.
mr.
charles
h.
miller
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
h.
miller
well,
what
we
are
saying
mr.
justice
rehnquist
is
that,
the
second
injunctive
portion
of
that
section
587.
mr.
charles
h.
miller
this
is
at
page
35
of
our
main
brief
at
appendix
a.
mr.
charles
h.
miller
that
is
the
language
that
reads,
“and
if
authorized
by
the
judge,
shall
have
and
may
exercise
such
additional
rights
and
powers
as
a
receiver
in
equity
would
have
if
appointed
by
a
court
of
the
united
states
for
the
property
of
the
debtor
and
we
say
that
a
receiver
in
equity
under
the
mccandless
case,
could
have
brought
this
action
and
we
can
too,
because
we
have
the
same
powers
as
a
receiver.
mr.
charles
h.
miller
no,
i
believe
that
the
property
concept
mr.
justice
white
does
not
have
a
place
here.
i
think
that
in
--
mr.
charles
h.
miller
well,
before
the
statute
was
enacted,
this
court
in
the
mccandless
case
gave
a
receiver
the
power
--
an
equity
receiver
the
power
to
go
after
assets
from
a
third
party
which
have
not
been
property
of
the
debtor,
but
in
fact,
was
diminution
of
the
value
of
the
debtor
caused
by
wrong
doing
on
the
part
of
insiders,
in
effect
the
equivalent
of
a
insider
wrong
doing.
and
i
say
that
the
property
concept
is
not
a
concept
which
should
control
in
this
court
and
not
should
the
concept
of
whether
or
not
there
happens
to
be
a
class
action
that
was
brought
here.
we
are
not
talking
about
this
case
alone
before
this
court.
we
are
talking
about
the
general
powers
and
the
general
authority
and
the
general
standing
of
a
reorganization
trustee.
we
know
there
are
limits
upon
that.
the
limits
upon
that
are,
that
the
matter
must
have
a
significant
relationship
to
the
reorganization
proceeding
and
i
think
it
clearly
does
here.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
h.
miller
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
suggest
that
the
parade
of
horribles
that
marine
midland
has
suggested
that
would
be
unleashed
if
the
trustee
were
given
standing
in
this
case,
it
just
does
not
exist
and
it
does
not
exist
for
one
reason
and
it
is
a
reason
that
we
assert
as
one
of
the
significant
reasons
why
the
trustee
should
have
standing
in
this
case.
everything
in
the
reorganization
is
under
the
supervision,
and
the
umbrella
and
the
aegis
of
a
reorganization
court.
it
is
under
the
aegis
of
a
reorganization
court,
which
has
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
before
it
at
every
step
in
the
proceeding.
before
any
action
can
be
started
the
reorganization
court
gives
permission
to
the
starting
of
the
action.
before
any
action
can
be
settled,
the
reorganization
court
determines
whether
the
settlement
is
fair
and
equitable
and
the
reorganization
court,
which
makes
that
determination,
does
it
on
the
basis
of
a
long
standing
knowledge
of
all
the
facts
or
circumstances
of
the
debtor's
estates,
of
the
debenture
holders,
of
all
the
various
packages
of
creditor's
rights
which
are
involved
here.
mr.
charles
h.
miller
no,
i
am
not.
now,
in
addition
to
that
--
mr.
charles
h.
miller
if
what,
mr.
justice
white?
i
am
sorry.
mr.
charles
h.
miller
yes,
that
was
--
mr.
charles
h.
miller
yes,
i
believe
that
they
could
have.
what
you
have
in
that
case
in
furtherance
of
your
question
to
mr.
dickey,
and
further
answer
to
it
i
think
was
nothing
more
than
a
chosen
action
and
i
think
you
have
the
same
thing
in
this
case.
perhaps
a
different
kind
of
chosen
action
but
no
different.
mr.
charles
h.
miller
well,
no.
it
belongs
to
the
debenture
holders
and
i
think,
if
i
may
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
is
not
the
problem,
that
is
what
this
case
is
all
about.
the
focus
in
this
case
has
come
to
be
directed
towards
the
estate
and
what
is
happening
with
the
estate.
we
are
talking
now
about
the
debenture
holders
and
the
debenture
holders
alone
and
whether
they
are
entitled
to
this
relief
and
we
are
seeking,
the
reorganization
trustee
is
seeking
to
sue
on
behalf
of
the
debenture
holders.
in
the
solar
case
and
in
the
clarke
case
and
in
prudence
bonds,
all
of
this
cases,
which
are
the
only
ones,
which
have
decided
this
question
for
the
most
part,
there
was
a
recovery
to
the
debenture
holders
on
certain
of
the
claims
allowed.
either
way
there
was
a
trust
reits
involved
or
a
certain
property
involved.
there
was
no
question
there
about
standing
or
affect
on
the
estate
or
subrogation
or
whether
there
would
be
any
of
these
other
matters
in
the
prayer
to
harbals
(ph)
which
have
been
asserted
before
you.
thank
you.
