mr.
john
w.
dickey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
clear
away
at
the
outset,
one
or
two
questions
that
i
think
are
left
open
by
what
has
gone
before.
first,
it
is
said
that
mr.
caplin
found
about
marine
midland’s
performance
that
it
had
been
grossly
negligent,
willfully
guilty
of
misconduct.
what
was
being
said,
simply
is,
that
mr.
caplin
is
alleging
that
in
the
complaint.
nothing
has
been
proved,
no
evidence
has
been
taken,
no
discovery
has
been
commenced,
there
has
been
no
answer
in
this
case.
we
are
here
purely
and
simply
on
the
question
of
whether
the
trustee
has
standing
to
allege
the
claims
that
are
set
forth
in
his
complaint
here.
there
is
no
claim
made
on
behalf
of
the
estate.
nothing
recovered
admittedly
by
the
commission,
admittedly
by
the
petitioner,
admittedly
will
accrue
to
the
benefit
of
the
estate
of
webb
&
knapp.
there
is
no
claim
made
here
under
the
trust
indenture
act.
it
is
not
mentioned
in
the
complaint
and
there
is
no
reliance
upon
and
jurisdiction
is
not
invoked
on
that
basis.
this
is
purely
and
simply
a
damage
suit
alleging
negligence
against
marine
midland
under
state
law
concepts
of
negligence,
claiming
that
we
should
have
recognized
the
falsity
of
certificates
dually
filed
with
us,
pursuant
to
the
provision
of
the
indenture
and
relied
on
them
as
we
were
entitled
to
do
under
the
terms
of
the
indenture
which
in
turn
was
a
qualified
indenture
under
the
trust
indenture
act.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
i
am
not
saying
--
no,
your
honor.
i
am
not
saying
that.
indeed,
the
fact
to
the
matter
is
that
louis
action
portions
of
the
complaint
of
which
are
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
is
an
action
which
not
only
is
based
on
or
purports
to
be
based
on
the
trust
indenture
act.
that
is
an
issue
that
is
presently
before
the
district
court
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
on
a
motion
by
that
plaintiff
in
behalf
of
his
class
of
debenture
holders
to
assert
a
claim
under
the
trust
indenture
act
by
amending
his
complaint
to
include
such
a
claim.
thus
far,
several
jurisdiction
has
been
invoked
by
that
plaintiff
and
by
that
class
of
debenture
holders,
which
includes
all
past
and
present
holders
and
purchasers
a
broader
class
that
we
are
talking
about
here.
a
jurisdiction
of
federal
court
there
is
invoked
under
the
securities
and
exchange
act
of
1934,
alleging
violations
of
10
(b)
(5).
mr.
john
w.
dickey
he
does
suggest,
your
honor,
in
a
footnote
in
his
opinion,
he
states
that
under
section
315
of
the
trust
indenture
act,
it
conceivably,
maybe
that
a
claim
will
lie
in
behalf
of
the
debenture
holders,
that
is
at
page
9,
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
at
page
92
of
the
joint
appendix,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
now,
there
is
one
other
point
before
looking
at
the
statute,
which
in
the
end
is
the
text
upon
which
i
suggest
this
case
must
be
decided.
it
has
been
said
that
the
answer
to
one
of
the
questions
was,
that
the
creditors
might
get
more
if
there
were
a
recovery
here,
if
the
doctrine
of
subrogation
were
not
applicable.
now,
judge
friendly
expounds
the
doctrine
of
subrogation
and
we
think
he
is
correct
in
his
analysis
and
we
have
set
forth
additional
support
for
that
basis,
for
that
position
in
our
brief.
but
the
actual
fact
in
this
case
is
that
the
question
is
all
together
moot.
nobody
is
going
to
benefit
other
than
the
debenture
holders
in
this
particular
case
because
as
this
case
stands,
a
plan
of
reorganization
has
already
been
proposed,
has
been
approved
by
the
sec,
has
been
submitted
to
judge
mcclain
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
and
in
that
plan
of
reorganization,
there
is
provision
for
the
debenture
holders
to
share
equally
as
part
of
the
same
class
with
the
general
unsecured
creditors,
share
and
share
alike.
and
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
in
their
comments
upon
the
plan
of
reorganization
which
was
submitted
to
them
for
their
consideration,
had
only
minor
modifications
to
suggest
and
here
is
the
modification
that
in
the
interest
of
full
disclosure
to
all
the
interested
parties
in
this
reorganization
proceedings.
the
plan
of
reorganization
should
make
absolutely
clear
that
unlike
the
other
claims
and
causes
of
action
which
the
trustee
is
reserving
and
may
prosecute
here
after,
any
fund
that
may
be
recovered
by
the
trustee
in
the
caplin
and
marine
midland
litigation
will
inure
solely
to
the
benefit
of
the
debenture
holders.
that
is
conceded,
that
is
the
end
of
it
so
far
as
any
further
benefit,
we
suggest
to
the
estate
of
the
debtor
or
to
anyone
who
may
have
any
share
or
any
claim
in
it.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
that
is
what
i
am
suggesting,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
no,
it
would
not
be
true
only
if
we
are
right
on
the
subrogation
point,
your
honor.
the
fact
to
the
matter
is
that,
i
suggest
damages
cannot
be
measured
in
behalf
of
the
debenture
holders.
their
claim
against
marine
midland
cannot
be
measured
in
the
limits
of
it
established
until
they
have
received
a
distribution
within
the
plan
of
reorganization.
this
has
been
suggested.
this
is
not
brand
new.
augustus
hand
in
the
majority
opinion
in
clarke
and
chase,
which
is
the
basic
case,
points
this
out
and
it
is
followed
by
the
second
circuit
in
this
case.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
but,
your
honor,
there
is
no
claim
asserted
to
that
end
in
this
complaint.
i
suggest
there
could
not
be
for
that
matter.
now,
let
us
look
at
the
statute.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
your
honor,
i
think
we
would
not
be
here
if
a
claim
had
been
asserted
in
behalf
of
webb
&
knapp,
claiming
that
marine
midland
was
in,
and
by
its
alleged
derelictions
was
in
a
causal
relationship
with
the
insolvency
of
webb
&
knapp.
we
would
not
be
here
on
a
standing
point
at
least.
we
might
very
well
be
here
eventually
on
the
question
of
whether
any
such
cause
of
action
will
lie,
whether
there
was
any
duty
owed
by
marine
midland,
the
indenture
trustee
to
the
debtor,
which
deceived
it
along
with
the
debenture
holders.
i
think
we
would
be
here
with
the
court's
permission
on
that
point,
but
not
on
the
state,
no,
your
honor.
now,
the
statute
if
the
court
please
because
that
is
the
basis
of
the
trustees
power
--
mr.
john
w.
dickey
i
do
not
think
it
could
have
been
recovered
from
marine
midland
because
there
would
be
no
measure
of
damage
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
w.
dickey
i
think
that
that
is
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
now,
the
fact
to
the
matter
is,
this
are
unsecured
debentures.
the
debenture
holders
bought
this
looking
to
the
creditor
webb
&
knapp.
there
is
no
security,
no
mortgages,
no
any
(voice
overlap)
that
is
what
it
is,
your
honor,
it's
a
debenture
and
therefore
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
w.
dickey
and
they
looked
to
the
creditor
webb
&
knapp
and
the
value,
any
value
that
these
debentures
may
have
is
a
value
measured
by
the
ability
of
webb
&
knapp
to
pay
them
off
when
the
time
comes
to
pay
them
off.
now,
let
us
assume
measure
your
honor,
let
us
suppose
that
in
the
reorganization,
we
are
lucky
and
it
is
determined
that
the
distribution
is
not
going
to
be
ten
cents
on
the
dollar
as
mr.
justice
white
hypothesizes,
but
a
100%
on
the
dollar.
let
us
suppose
there
is
enough
recovered
to
take
care
of
all
of
the
general
unsecured
creditors
including
the
debenture
holders.
no
damages
have
been
sustained
by
the
debenture
holders.
no
claim
would
lie
against
marine
midland,
not
withstanding
a
proved
claim
if
a
debenture
were
proved
that
there
had
been
dereliction
of
--
mr.
john
w.
dickey
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
it
has
not
been
approved
by
the
court
yet,
but
it
is
before
the
court
so
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
w.
dickey
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
thus
i
suggest
that
the
measure
of
damages
that
can
be
asserted
against
marine
midland
is
96
cents
on
the
dollar.
now,
the
statute
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
w.
dickey
not
an
issue,
i
suggest.
i
think
it
is
a
secondary
point.
i
think
it
can
be
mandated
and
it
is
correct
but
we
do
not
rely
on
it.
we
rely
on
the
measure
of
damages
point.
now,
if
your
honor
please,
the
court
please
--
mr.
john
w.
dickey
i
beg
your
pardon
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
your
honor,
it
is.
both
points
are
made;
the
subrogation
point
that
judge
friendly
goes
on
to
say.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
that
is
correct.
the
subrogation
point
is
made
there
and
in
addition,
judge
friendly
goes
on
and
says,
even
more
importantly,
we
do
not
see
the
answer
to
the
statement
made
by
judge
augustus
hand
in
clarke
against
chase
in
which
he
made
the
argument
that
i
have
just
made
to
the
court.
we
think
if
the
court
please
that
the
fundamental
and
disposity
fact
here
is
that
there
is
no
power
granted
under
the
chandler
act
of
the
kind
claimed
here
by
the
chapter
x
trustee.
there
is
no
provision
in
the
chandler
act.
we
suggest
upon
which
any
implication
can
be
fairly
based
that
the
congress
intended
any
such
power.
the
trustees,
the
creature
of
the
statute,
the
statute
is
meticulously
drawn,
meticulously
drawn
with
respect
to
the
rights
and
the
powers
and
the
duties
and
specifically,
with
respect
to
the
powers
and
duties
of
a
chapter
x
trustee
in
enforcing
and
prosecuting
causes
of
action.
under
the
statute,
the
trustee
succeeds
to
the
title
of
the
debtor's
estate
and
by
section
70
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
having
taken
title
of
the
debtor
to
“property
of
the
debtor,”
the
section
goes
on
to
define
in
fine
detail
what
property
means
and
specifically
to
define
in
fine
detail,
what
property
means
in
the
context
of
causes
of
action
to
which
the
trustee
falls
there
and
to
which
he
takes
title.
in
section
70
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
this
is
how
it's
defined
with
respect
to
causes
of
action.
he
takes
title
the
rights
of
action
“which
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
petition
the
debtor
could
by
any
means
have
transferred
or
which
might
have
been
levied
upon
and
sold
under
judicial
process
against
him
or
otherwise
sees
impounded
or
sequestered”
and
in
the
following
sub
paragraph,
“rights
of
action
arising
upon
contracts
used
or
the
unlawful
taking
or
detention
off
or
injury
to
the
debtors
property,”
everything
is
focused
on
property.
and
section
167,
empowers
the
trustee
to
investigate
the
acts
and
the
conduct
and
the
property,
and
the
liabilities
and
the
financial
condition
of
“debtor”
in
the
desirability
of
continuing
the
business.
and
any
other
matter
relevant
to
the
reorganization
proceeding
or
to
the
formulation
of
a
plan
and
then
he
is
empowered
to
report
that,
directed
indeed
to
report
that
to
the
judge.
and
with
respect
to
causes
of
action,
he
is
directed
to
report
to
the
judge
any
facts
ascertained
by
him,
pertaining
the
causes
of
action
available
to
the
estate.
now,
these
provisions
are
clear
and
an
ambiguous.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
only
if
damage
could
be
shown
to
a
accrue
against
the
debtors.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
i
think
there
would
be
a
cause
of
action.
there
would
be
a
cause
of
action
in
behalf
of
the
estate
and
for
the
recovery
of
damages,
which
would
accrue
to
the
benefit
of
the
estate,
and
therefore,
be
available
to
be
shared
amongst
debenture
holders,
general
unsecured
creditors
and
everybody
else,
the
stockholders
indeed.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
it
would
be
a
damage
suit,
your
honor.
they
would
have
to
show
some
kind
of
damage.
i
do
not
think
the
measure
of
damages
would
be
the
amount
of
the
debentures
that
they
had
issued,
no.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
i
think
your
honor
is
right.
i
think
it
would
not
be
--
mr.
john
w.
dickey
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
it
really
did
not
get
money
for
the
debenture
holders.
the
debenture
holders
simply
are
left
holding
debentures,
but
you
are
unsupported
by
property.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
right,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
i
think
that
is
right.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
and
the
proceeds
of
that
action
would
be
available
to
the
state,
would
accrue
to
the
estate.
that
is
a
cause
of
action
which
in
the
terms
of
the
statue
could
be
transferred,
could
be
levied
upon,
etcetera.
much
reliance
is
placed
here
upon
legislative
history
or
i
should
say
purported
legislative
history,
that
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
in
the
first
place,
the
statute
is
clear
and
there
is
no
occasion
to
look
to
it
and
in
the
second
place
on
its
face,
the
legislative
history,
which
is
cited
in
the
briefs
for
the
petitioner
and
for
the
commission
here
shows
that
all
of
the
talk
about
the
intention
of
the
congress
to
effect
protection
of
public
investors
and
to
bring
about
the
appointment
of
an
independent
trustee
for
the
purpose
of
the
protection
of
public
investors,
everything
that
went
in
to
the
eventual
recommendations,
which
led
to
the
chandler
act,
they
are
all
pointed
toward
the
participation
of
the
independent
trustee
within
the
reorganization
proceedings.
not
at
any
point
is
there
any
testimony
by
any
witness,
nothing
in
any
report
of
either
house
or
congress
or
any
committee,
nothing
in
any
of
the
sources,
which
pass
for
legislative
history
here
in
which
there
is
any
suggestion
that
anyone
even
urged
the
power,
which
is
sought
here
today.
i
pass
that
at
that
point.
i
think
in
summary
the
chandler
act
was
intended
to
provide
protection
for
public
investors
and
to
that
end
the
act
created
the
office
of
the
independent
trustee
and
the
trustee’s
function
is
to
protect
them
within
the
context
and
within
the
parameters
of
the
proceedings.
he
is
obliged
to
collect
the
property
of
the
debtor
to
preserve
it.
if
possible,
to
attempt
to
rehabilitate
the
corporation,
in
this
case,
that
has
been
determined
to
be
impossible
and
the
plan
of
reorganization
here
is
nothing
more
than
a
plan
for
orderly
liquidation
on
a
relatively
moderate
scale.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
i
think
in
those
circumstances,
if
it
were
a
guarantee
of
a
third
party,
judge
learned
hand
in
one
of
the
prudence
bond
cases
reached
the
conclusion
that
that
was
property
he
approached
it
on
the
basis
and
analyzing
it
as
a
property
of
the
debtor
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
w.
dickey
but
it
is
a
promise
of
a
third
party,
your
honor,
which
if
drawn
upon
and
used
to
pay
the
debentures,
to
that
extent,
enlarges
the
estate
of
the
debtor
and
that
is
precisely
the
distinction
he
drew
in
the
prudence
bond
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
w.
dickey
it
avoids
a
drain,
if
you
will
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
it
permits
the
debentures
to
get
paid.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
well,
if
your
honor
please,
no.
the
distinction
drawn
in
that
case
and
i
suggest
the
proper
distinction
is
this,
that
the
two
issues
before
the
court
as
to
standing
in
that
case
were
the
right
or
standing
of
the
trustee
to
state
a
claim
against
the
indenture
trustee
for
letting
a
third
party's
guarantee
go
and
in
that
case,
it
was
determined
that
there
was
standing
because
had
that
security
in
affect
not
been
released,
then
the
debentures
would
have
been
paid
from
that
and
there
would
have
been
no
claim
by
the
debenture
holders
against
the
debtor’s
estate.
in
context
--
mr.
john
w.
dickey
at
least,
that
was
the
theory
of
that
case.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
it
had
been
enlarged
or
at
least
prevented
from
being
drained
mr.
justice.
on
the
other
hand,
in
the
other
side
of
that
case
where
the
question
was
standing
to
sue
because
of
the
release
by
the
indenture
trustee,
not
of
the
third
party's
guarantee,
but
of
the
guarantee
of
the
debtor
itself,
a
distinction
was
drawn
and
it
was
found
that
there
would
be
no
effect
on
the
debtor’s
estate
and
therefore
standing
would
not
lie
within
the
terms
of
the
chandler
act.
now,
your
honor,
i
will
not
go
through
the
second
circuit
cases.
they
have
been
discussed,
they
are
fully
briefed,
they
have
to
be
read.
i
would
like
to
move
on
to
what
i
think
is
the
real
vice
that
is
inherent
in
the
position
that's
advanced
here
by
the
petitioner
and
by
the
commission.
because
they
are
not
asking
this
court
simply
to
imply
that
the
chandler
act
should
be
interpreted
in
such
a
way
as
to
permit
a
modest
extension
of
power
on
the
part
of
the
trustee
to
assert
this
single
claim
against
marine
midland
in
this
particular
case.
what
they
are
asking
the
court
to
do
because
they
cannot
risk
on
that
simple
point
is,
to
imply
numerous
decisions
or
conclusions
as
to
numerous
questions
involving
other
statutes
and
other
rules
in
the
class
action
and
securities
law
field.
that
is
to
say
that
to
sustain
their
position,
this
court
or
possibly
the
district
court,
maybe
we
have
an
agenda
for
years
of
litigation
before
us
here
if
this
position
is
sustained,
either
this
court
or
the
district
courts
and
in
the
courts
of
appeal
and
then
we
may
be
back
here,
we
are
going
to
have
to
make
decisions
of
necessity
of
this
kind.
they
are
going
to
have
to
imply
the
answer
to
the
question
whether
or
not
the
power
claimed
by
the
trustee
is
exclusive
or
not
exclusive.
i
understand
they
do
not
claim
that
it
is
not
exclusive.
they
claim
that
it
is
preferred
that
the
trustee
have
this
power.
they
also
say
that
as
a
practical
matter
if
they
have
granted
this
power,
they
will
in
fact
sweep
the
field
clean
because
other
debenture
holder
suing
in
their
private
capacity
would
not
be
inclined
to
risk
the
money
and
the
time
for
what
may
in
the
end
prove
to
be
a
futile
action
if
the
trustee’s
action
in
fact
is
permitted
to
be
preferred
and
go
forward.
if
the
conclusion
is
that
the
power
is
not
exclusive
and
if
the
conclusion
is,
that
it
is
presumptively
to
be
preferred
that
the
trustee
prosecute
this
action,
then
i
ask
what
rule
are
we
looking
to,
from
what
do
we
imply
to
this
kind
a
conclusion,
what
rule
or
statute
is
involved
here?
and
if
the
trustee’s
power
is
implied
not
to
be
exclusive
and
not
even
to
be
presumably
and
presumptively
preferred,
but
is
just
run
a
parallel
with
private
actions
brought
by
class
claimants,
private
debenture
holders
suing
in
their
own
behalf,
then
where
thus
that
leave
us
with
respect
to
rule
23
in
the
federal
courts?
where
does
it
leave
us
with
respect
to
the
confusion
that
would
be
caused
in
delicate
state
federal
relations
with
respect
to
parallel
class
action
provisions
under
state
law?
think
of
the
questions
that
have
to
be
answered
once
we
get
into
that
area.
who
is
to
go
forward
first?
how
are
we
going
to
determine
the
priorities
between
the
competing
suitors,
the
private
litigants
on
one
hand,
which
we
have
two
in
this
case
and
the
trustee
on
the
other
hand.
there
is
mechanics
for
making
that
decision
under
rule
23
and
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
there
is
practice
of
staying
a
federal
action
in
favor
of
a
state
action
often
to
let
it
run
its
course
and
see
how
it
will
come
out.
but
these
are
things
that
are
worked
out
and
have
been
over
the
past
30
years
of
class
action
litigation
under
the
securities
laws
and
otherwise
and
under
rule
23,
which
suddenly
are
going
to
be
thrown
in
the
chaos
when
the
trustee
steps
into
the
water
and
lends
his
weight
here
to
this
kind
of
a
claim.
what
do
we
do
about
collateral
estoppel?
what
happens?
is
it
a
race
to
judgment
amongst
these
people
and
the
first
one
gets
there,
binds
the
others?
if
the
debenture
holders
get
the
judgment
first,
does
that
bind
the
trustee
and
is
the
trustee’s
action
out
in
contrast
or
does
the
trustee’s
action
take
precedence?
is
the
trustee’s
action
subject
to
rule
23?
there
is
a
suggestion
in
the
brief
that
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
rules
similar
to
rule
23
will
not
be
invoked
here
to
govern
this
action,
but
which
parts
of
that
rule?
i
mean,
in
the
first
place,
rule
of
23
cannot
apply
to
the
trustee.
he
does
not
meet
the
first
condition
preceding.
he
is
not
a
member
of
the
class
and
to
apply
rule
23
to
him,
this
court
would
have
to
decide
that
the
framers
of
rule
23
of
this
court
in
affect
had
intended
that
it
read
not
that
a
member
of
the
class
may
sue
representatively,
but
a
member
of
the
class
preempts
us
and
a
chapter
x
trustee
of
this
so
pleases
may
assert
such
an
action.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
well,
as
to
an
individual
debenture
holders
they
would
not
be
collaterally
estopped,
i
suggest
your
honor,
under
the
operation
of
rule
23
because
of
the
opt
out
provisions
of
rule
23.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
we
have
such
in
this
case.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
no,
there
is
no.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
no
collateral
estoppel
on
that
case,
but
here
we
have
a
trustee
who
purports
to
sue
in
behalf
of
the
whole
class
or
a
very
large
part
of
it
at
least,
his
action
is
not
as
broad
as
the
other
two
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
w.
dickey
that
is
right
and
i
suggest
your
honor
that
his
action
is
redundant,
that
it
is
unnecessary.
that
in
this
case
he
is
looking
to
an
impoverish
estate
of
finance
a
litigation
which
need
not
be
brought
because
the
debenture
holders
are
in
both
the
state
court
and
the
federal
court
asserting
their
claims
vigorously.
discovery
has
been
had
in
one
of
those
cases.
the
case
is
farther
along
than
this
one
and
the
only
reason
it
is
not
farther
is
that
the
district
court
knowing
of
the
grant
of
certiorari
in
this
case
has
stayed
the
louis
federal
action
to
see
what
conclusions
are
reached
here.
and
i
suggest
your
honor
in
conclusion,
if
the
court
please
in
conclusion
that
we
are
opening
pandora’s
box
once
we
cross
the
initial
bridge
of
accepting
the
argument
that
is
made
here
and
the
claim
of
standing
because
we
have
no
answers
to
give
to
all
the
complex
of
questions,
which
then
faces
procedurally
with
respect
to
collateral
estoppel
with
respect
to
res
judicata,
with
respect
to
priorities
of
claim,
with
respect
to
delicate
relations
between
the
state
governments
and
the
federal
governments
and
their
respective
rules.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
clear
away
at
the
outset,
one
or
two
questions
that
i
think
are
left
open
by
what
has
gone
before.
first,
it
is
said
that
mr.
caplin
found
about
marine
midland’s
performance
that
it
had
been
grossly
negligent,
willfully
guilty
of
misconduct.
what
was
being
said,
simply
is,
that
mr.
caplin
is
alleging
that
in
the
complaint.
nothing
has
been
proved,
no
evidence
has
been
taken,
no
discovery
has
been
commenced,
there
has
been
no
answer
in
this
case.
we
are
here
purely
and
simply
on
the
question
of
whether
the
trustee
has
standing
to
allege
the
claims
that
are
set
forth
in
his
complaint
here.
there
is
no
claim
made
on
behalf
of
the
estate.
nothing
recovered
admittedly
by
the
commission,
admittedly
by
the
petitioner,
admittedly
will
accrue
to
the
benefit
of
the
estate
of
webb
&
knapp.
there
is
no
claim
made
here
under
the
trust
indenture
act.
it
is
not
mentioned
in
the
complaint
and
there
is
no
reliance
upon
and
jurisdiction
is
not
invoked
on
that
basis.
this
is
purely
and
simply
a
damage
suit
alleging
negligence
against
marine
midland
under
state
law
concepts
of
negligence,
claiming
that
we
should
have
recognized
the
falsity
of
certificates
dually
filed
with
us,
pursuant
to
the
provision
of
the
indenture
and
relied
on
them
as
we
were
entitled
to
do
under
the
terms
of
the
indenture
which
in
turn
was
a
qualified
indenture
under
the
trust
indenture
act.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
i
am
not
saying
--
no,
your
honor.
i
am
not
saying
that.
indeed,
the
fact
to
the
matter
is
that
louis
action
portions
of
the
complaint
of
which
are
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
is
an
action
which
not
only
is
based
on
or
purports
to
be
based
on
the
trust
indenture
act.
that
is
an
issue
that
is
presently
before
the
district
court
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
on
a
motion
by
that
plaintiff
in
behalf
of
his
class
of
debenture
holders
to
assert
a
claim
under
the
trust
indenture
act
by
amending
his
complaint
to
include
such
a
claim.
thus
far,
several
jurisdiction
has
been
invoked
by
that
plaintiff
and
by
that
class
of
debenture
holders,
which
includes
all
past
and
present
holders
and
purchasers
a
broader
class
that
we
are
talking
about
here.
a
jurisdiction
of
federal
court
there
is
invoked
under
the
securities
and
exchange
act
of
1934,
alleging
violations
of
10
(b)
(5).
mr.
john
w.
dickey
he
does
suggest,
your
honor,
in
a
footnote
in
his
opinion,
he
states
that
under
section
315
of
the
trust
indenture
act,
it
conceivably,
maybe
that
a
claim
will
lie
in
behalf
of
the
debenture
holders,
that
is
at
page
9,
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
at
page
92
of
the
joint
appendix,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
now,
there
is
one
other
point
before
looking
at
the
statute,
which
in
the
end
is
the
text
upon
which
i
suggest
this
case
must
be
decided.
it
has
been
said
that
the
answer
to
one
of
the
questions
was,
that
the
creditors
might
get
more
if
there
were
a
recovery
here,
if
the
doctrine
of
subrogation
were
not
applicable.
now,
judge
friendly
expounds
the
doctrine
of
subrogation
and
we
think
he
is
correct
in
his
analysis
and
we
have
set
forth
additional
support
for
that
basis,
for
that
position
in
our
brief.
but
the
actual
fact
in
this
case
is
that
the
question
is
all
together
moot.
nobody
is
going
to
benefit
other
than
the
debenture
holders
in
this
particular
case
because
as
this
case
stands,
a
plan
of
reorganization
has
already
been
proposed,
has
been
approved
by
the
sec,
has
been
submitted
to
judge
mcclain
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
and
in
that
plan
of
reorganization,
there
is
provision
for
the
debenture
holders
to
share
equally
as
part
of
the
same
class
with
the
general
unsecured
creditors,
share
and
share
alike.
and
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
in
their
comments
upon
the
plan
of
reorganization
which
was
submitted
to
them
for
their
consideration,
had
only
minor
modifications
to
suggest
and
here
is
the
modification
that
in
the
interest
of
full
disclosure
to
all
the
interested
parties
in
this
reorganization
proceedings.
the
plan
of
reorganization
should
make
absolutely
clear
that
unlike
the
other
claims
and
causes
of
action
which
the
trustee
is
reserving
and
may
prosecute
here
after,
any
fund
that
may
be
recovered
by
the
trustee
in
the
caplin
and
marine
midland
litigation
will
inure
solely
to
the
benefit
of
the
debenture
holders.
that
is
conceded,
that
is
the
end
of
it
so
far
as
any
further
benefit,
we
suggest
to
the
estate
of
the
debtor
or
to
anyone
who
may
have
any
share
or
any
claim
in
it.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
that
is
what
i
am
suggesting,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
no,
it
would
not
be
true
only
if
we
are
right
on
the
subrogation
point,
your
honor.
the
fact
to
the
matter
is
that,
i
suggest
damages
cannot
be
measured
in
behalf
of
the
debenture
holders.
their
claim
against
marine
midland
cannot
be
measured
in
the
limits
of
it
established
until
they
have
received
a
distribution
within
the
plan
of
reorganization.
this
has
been
suggested.
this
is
not
brand
new.
augustus
hand
in
the
majority
opinion
in
clarke
and
chase,
which
is
the
basic
case,
points
this
out
and
it
is
followed
by
the
second
circuit
in
this
case.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
but,
your
honor,
there
is
no
claim
asserted
to
that
end
in
this
complaint.
i
suggest
there
could
not
be
for
that
matter.
now,
let
us
look
at
the
statute.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
your
honor,
i
think
we
would
not
be
here
if
a
claim
had
been
asserted
in
behalf
of
webb
&
knapp,
claiming
that
marine
midland
was
in,
and
by
its
alleged
derelictions
was
in
a
causal
relationship
with
the
insolvency
of
webb
&
knapp.
we
would
not
be
here
on
a
standing
point
at
least.
we
might
very
well
be
here
eventually
on
the
question
of
whether
any
such
cause
of
action
will
lie,
whether
there
was
any
duty
owed
by
marine
midland,
the
indenture
trustee
to
the
debtor,
which
deceived
it
along
with
the
debenture
holders.
i
think
we
would
be
here
with
the
court's
permission
on
that
point,
but
not
on
the
state,
no,
your
honor.
now,
the
statute
if
the
court
please
because
that
is
the
basis
of
the
trustees
power
--
mr.
john
w.
dickey
i
do
not
think
it
could
have
been
recovered
from
marine
midland
because
there
would
be
no
measure
of
damage
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
w.
dickey
i
think
that
that
is
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
now,
the
fact
to
the
matter
is,
this
are
unsecured
debentures.
the
debenture
holders
bought
this
looking
to
the
creditor
webb
&
knapp.
there
is
no
security,
no
mortgages,
no
any
(voice
overlap)
that
is
what
it
is,
your
honor,
it's
a
debenture
and
therefore
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
w.
dickey
and
they
looked
to
the
creditor
webb
&
knapp
and
the
value,
any
value
that
these
debentures
may
have
is
a
value
measured
by
the
ability
of
webb
&
knapp
to
pay
them
off
when
the
time
comes
to
pay
them
off.
now,
let
us
assume
measure
your
honor,
let
us
suppose
that
in
the
reorganization,
we
are
lucky
and
it
is
determined
that
the
distribution
is
not
going
to
be
ten
cents
on
the
dollar
as
mr.
justice
white
hypothesizes,
but
a
100%
on
the
dollar.
let
us
suppose
there
is
enough
recovered
to
take
care
of
all
of
the
general
unsecured
creditors
including
the
debenture
holders.
no
damages
have
been
sustained
by
the
debenture
holders.
no
claim
would
lie
against
marine
midland,
not
withstanding
a
proved
claim
if
a
debenture
were
proved
that
there
had
been
dereliction
of
--
mr.
john
w.
dickey
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
it
has
not
been
approved
by
the
court
yet,
but
it
is
before
the
court
so
(voice

mr.
john
w.
dickey
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
thus
i
suggest
that
the
measure
of
damages
that
can
be
asserted
against
marine
midland
is
96
cents
on
the
dollar.
now,
the
statute
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
w.
dickey
not
an
issue,
i
suggest.
i
think
it
is
a
secondary
point.
i
think
it
can
be
mandated
and
it
is
correct
but
we
do
not
rely
on
it.
we
rely
on
the
measure
of
damages
point.
now,
if
your
honor
please,
the
court
please
--
mr.
john
w.
dickey
i
beg
your
pardon
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
your
honor,
it
is.
both
points
are
made;
the
subrogation
point
that
judge
friendly
goes
on
to
say.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
that
is
correct.
the
subrogation
point
is
made
there
and
in
addition,
judge
friendly
goes
on
and
says,
even
more
importantly,
we
do
not
see
the
answer
to
the
statement
made
by
judge
augustus
hand
in
clarke
against
chase
in
which
he
made
the
argument
that
i
have
just
made
to
the
court.
we
think
if
the
court
please
that
the
fundamental
and
disposity
fact
here
is
that
there
is
no
power
granted
under
the
chandler
act
of
the
kind
claimed
here
by
the
chapter
x
trustee.
there
is
no
provision
in
the
chandler
act.
we
suggest
upon
which
any
implication
can
be
fairly
based
that
the
congress
intended
any
such
power.
the
trustees,
the
creature
of
the
statute,
the
statute
is
meticulously
drawn,
meticulously
drawn
with
respect
to
the
rights
and
the
powers
and
the
duties
and
specifically,
with
respect
to
the
powers
and
duties
of
a
chapter
x
trustee
in
enforcing
and
prosecuting
causes
of
action.
under
the
statute,
the
trustee
succeeds
to
the
title
of
the
debtor's
estate
and
by
section
70
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
having
taken
title
of
the
debtor
to
“property
of
the
debtor,”
the
section
goes
on
to
define
in
fine
detail
what
property
means
and
specifically
to
define
in
fine
detail,
what
property
means
in
the
context
of
causes
of
action
to
which
the
trustee
falls
there
and
to
which
he
takes
title.
in
section
70
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
this
is
how
it's
defined
with
respect
to
causes
of
action.
he
takes
title
the
rights
of
action
“which
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
petition
the
debtor
could
by
any
means
have
transferred
or
which
might
have
been
levied
upon
and
sold
under
judicial
process
against
him
or
otherwise
sees
impounded
or
sequestered”
and
in
the
following
sub
paragraph,
“rights
of
action
arising
upon
contracts
used
or
the
unlawful
taking
or
detention
off
or
injury
to
the
debtors
property,”
everything
is
focused
on
property.
and
section
167,
empowers
the
trustee
to
investigate
the
acts
and
the
conduct
and
the
property,
and
the
liabilities
and
the
financial
condition
of
“debtor”
in
the
desirability
of
continuing
the
business.
and
any
other
matter
relevant
to
the
reorganization
proceeding
or
to
the
formulation
of
a
plan
and
then
he
is
empowered
to
report
that,
directed
indeed
to
report
that
to
the
judge.
and
with
respect
to
causes
of
action,
he
is
directed
to
report
to
the
judge
any
facts
ascertained
by
him,
pertaining
the
causes
of
action
available
to
the
estate.
now,
these
provisions
are
clear
and
an
ambiguous.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
only
if
damage
could
be
shown
to
a
accrue
against
the
debtors.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
i
think
there
would
be
a
cause
of
action.
there
would
be
a
cause
of
action
in
behalf
of
the
estate
and
for
the
recovery
of
damages,
which
would
accrue
to
the
benefit
of
the
estate,
and
therefore,
be
available
to
be
shared
amongst
debenture
holders,
general
unsecured
creditors
and
everybody
else,
the
stockholders
indeed.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
it
would
be
a
damage
suit,
your
honor.
they
would
have
to
show
some
kind
of
damage.
i
do
not
think
the
measure
of
damages
would
be
the
amount
of
the
debentures
that
they
had
issued,
no.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
i
think
your
honor
is
right.
i
think
it
would
not
be
--
mr.
john
w.
dickey
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
it
really
did
not
get
money
for
the
debenture
holders.
the
debenture
holders
simply
are
left
holding
debentures,
but
you
are
unsupported
by
property.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
right,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
i
think
that
is
right.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
and
the
proceeds
of
that
action
would
be
available
to
the
state,
would
accrue
to
the
estate.
that
is
a
cause
of
action
which
in
the
terms
of
the
statue
could
be
transferred,
could
be
levied
upon,
etcetera.
much
reliance
is
placed
here
upon
legislative
history
or
i
should
say
purported
legislative
history,
that
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
in
the
first
place,
the
statute
is
clear
and
there
is
no
occasion
to
look
to
it
and
in
the
second
place
on
its
face,
the
legislative
history,
which
is
cited
in
the
briefs
for
the
petitioner
and
for
the
commission
here
shows
that
all
of
the
talk
about
the
intention
of
the
congress
to
effect
protection
of
public
investors
and
to
bring
about
the
appointment
of
an
independent
trustee
for
the
purpose
of
the
protection
of
public
investors,
everything
that
went
in
to
the
eventual
recommendations,
which
led
to
the
chandler
act,
they
are
all
pointed
toward
the
participation
of
the
independent
trustee
within
the
reorganization
proceedings.
not
at
any
point
is
there
any
testimony
by
any
witness,
nothing
in
any
report
of
either
house
or
congress
or
any
committee,
nothing
in
any
of
the
sources,
which
pass
for
legislative
history
here
in
which
there
is
any
suggestion
that
anyone
even
urged
the
power,
which
is
sought
here
today.
i
pass
that
at
that
point.
i
think
in
summary
the
chandler
act
was
intended
to
provide
protection
for
public
investors
and
to
that
end
the
act
created
the
office
of
the
independent
trustee
and
the
trustee’s
function
is
to
protect
them
within
the
context
and
within
the
parameters
of
the
proceedings.
he
is
obliged
to
collect
the
property
of
the
debtor
to
preserve
it.
if
possible,
to
attempt
to
rehabilitate
the
corporation,
in
this
case,
that
has
been
determined
to
be
impossible
and
the
plan
of
reorganization
here
is
nothing
more
than
a
plan
for
orderly
liquidation
on
a
relatively
moderate
scale.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
i
think
in
those
circumstances,
if
it
were
a
guarantee
of
a
third
party,
judge
learned
hand
in
one
of
the
prudence
bond
cases
reached
the
conclusion
that
that
was
property
he
approached
it
on
the
basis
and
analyzing
it
as
a
property
of
the
debtor
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
w.
dickey
but
it
is
a
promise
of
a
third
party,
your
honor,
which
if
drawn
upon
and
used
to
pay
the
debentures,
to
that
extent,
enlarges
the
estate
of
the
debtor
and
that
is
precisely
the
distinction
he
drew
in
the
prudence
bond
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
w.
dickey
it
avoids
a
drain,
if
you
will
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
it
permits
the
debentures
to
get
paid.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
well,
if
your
honor
please,
no.
the
distinction
drawn
in
that
case
and
i
suggest
the
proper
distinction
is
this,
that
the
two
issues
before
the
court
as
to
standing
in
that
case
were
the
right
or
standing
of
the
trustee
to
state
a
claim
against
the
indenture
trustee
for
letting
a
third
party's
guarantee
go
and
in
that
case,
it
was
determined
that
there
was
standing
because
had
that
security
in
affect
not
been
released,
then
the
debentures
would
have
been
paid
from
that
and
there
would
have
been
no
claim
by
the
debenture
holders
against
the
debtor’s
estate.
in
context
--
mr.
john
w.
dickey
at
least,
that
was
the
theory
of
that
case.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
it
had
been
enlarged
or
at
least
prevented
from
being
drained
mr.
justice.
on
the
other
hand,
in
the
other
side
of
that
case
where
the
question
was
standing
to
sue
because
of
the
release
by
the
indenture
trustee,
not
of
the
third
party's
guarantee,
but
of
the
guarantee
of
the
debtor
itself,
a
distinction
was
drawn
and
it
was
found
that
there
would
be
no
effect
on
the
debtor’s
estate
and
therefore
standing
would
not
lie
within
the
terms
of
the
chandler
act.
now,
your
honor,
i
will
not
go
through
the
second
circuit
cases.
they
have
been
discussed,
they
are
fully
briefed,
they
have
to
be
read.
i
would
like
to
move
on
to
what
i
think
is
the
real
vice
that
is
inherent
in
the
position
that's
advanced
here
by
the
petitioner
and
by
the
commission.
because
they
are
not
asking
this
court
simply
to
imply
that
the
chandler
act
should
be
interpreted
in
such
a
way
as
to
permit
a
modest
extension
of
power
on
the
part
of
the
trustee
to
assert
this
single
claim
against
marine
midland
in
this
particular
case.
what
they
are
asking
the
court
to
do
because
they
cannot
risk
on
that
simple
point
is,
to
imply
numerous
decisions
or
conclusions
as
to
numerous
questions
involving
other
statutes
and
other
rules
in
the
class
action
and
securities
law
field.
that
is
to
say
that
to
sustain
their
position,
this
court
or
possibly
the
district
court,
maybe
we
have
an
agenda
for
years
of
litigation
before
us
here
if
this
position
is
sustained,
either
this
court
or
the
district
courts
and
in
the
courts
of
appeal
and
then
we
may
be
back
here,
we
are
going
to
have
to
make
decisions
of
necessity
of
this
kind.
they
are
going
to
have
to
imply
the
answer
to
the
question
whether
or
not
the
power
claimed
by
the
trustee
is
exclusive
or
not
exclusive.
i
understand
they
do
not
claim
that
it
is
not
exclusive.
they
claim
that
it
is
preferred
that
the
trustee
have
this
power.
they
also
say
that
as
a
practical
matter
if
they
have
granted
this
power,
they
will
in
fact
sweep
the
field
clean
because
other
debenture
holder
suing
in
their
private
capacity
would
not
be
inclined
to
risk
the
money
and
the
time
for
what
may
in
the
end
prove
to
be
a
futile
action
if
the
trustee’s
action
in
fact
is
permitted
to
be
preferred
and
go
forward.
if
the
conclusion
is
that
the
power
is
not
exclusive
and
if
the
conclusion
is,
that
it
is
presumptively
to
be
preferred
that
the
trustee
prosecute
this
action,
then
i
ask
what
rule
are
we
looking
to,
from
what
do
we
imply
to
this
kind
a
conclusion,
what
rule
or
statute
is
involved
here?
and
if
the
trustee’s
power
is
implied
not
to
be
exclusive
and
not
even
to
be
presumably
and
presumptively
preferred,
but
is
just
run
a
parallel
with
private
actions
brought
by
class
claimants,
private
debenture
holders
suing
in
their
own
behalf,
then
where
thus
that
leave
us
with
respect
to
rule
23
in
the
federal
courts?
where
does
it
leave
us
with
respect
to
the
confusion
that
would
be
caused
in
delicate
state
federal
relations
with
respect
to
parallel
class
action
provisions
under
state
law?
think
of
the
questions
that
have
to
be
answered
once
we
get
into
that
area.
who
is
to
go
forward
first?
how
are
we
going
to
determine
the
priorities
between
the
competing
suitors,
the
private
litigants
on
one
hand,
which
we
have
two
in
this
case
and
the
trustee
on
the
other
hand.
there
is
mechanics
for
making
that
decision
under
rule
23
and
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
there
is
practice
of
staying
a
federal
action
in
favor
of
a
state
action
often
to
let
it
run
its
course
and
see
how
it
will
come
out.
but
these
are
things
that
are
worked
out
and
have
been
over
the
past
30
years
of
class
action
litigation
under
the
securities
laws
and
otherwise
and
under
rule
23,
which
suddenly
are
going
to
be
thrown
in
the
chaos
when
the
trustee
steps
into
the
water
and
lends
his
weight
here
to
this
kind
of
a
claim.
what
do
we
do
about
collateral
estoppel?
what
happens?
is
it
a
race
to
judgment
amongst
these
people
and
the
first
one
gets
there,
binds
the
others?
if
the
debenture
holders
get
the
judgment
first,
does
that
bind
the
trustee
and
is
the
trustee’s
action
out
in
contrast
or
does
the
trustee’s
action
take
precedence?
is
the
trustee’s
action
subject
to
rule
23?
there
is
a
suggestion
in
the
brief
that
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
rules
similar
to
rule
23
will
not
be
invoked
here
to
govern
this
action,
but
which
parts
of
that
rule?
i
mean,
in
the
first
place,
rule
of
23
cannot
apply
to
the
trustee.
he
does
not
meet
the
first
condition
preceding.
he
is
not
a
member
of
the
class
and
to
apply
rule
23
to
him,
this
court
would
have
to
decide
that
the
framers
of
rule
23
of
this
court
in
affect
had
intended
that
it
read
not
that
a
member
of
the
class
may
sue
representatively,
but
a
member
of
the
class
preempts
us
and
a
chapter
x
trustee
of
this
so
pleases
may
assert
such
an
action.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
well,
as
to
an
individual
debenture
holders
they
would
not
be
collaterally
estopped,
i
suggest
your
honor,
under
the
operation
of
rule
23
because
of
the
opt
out
provisions
of
rule
23.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
we
have
such
in
this
case.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
no,
there
is
no.
mr.
john
w.
dickey
no
collateral
estoppel
on
that
case,
but
here
we
have
a
trustee
who
purports
to
sue
in
behalf
of
the
whole
class
or
a
very
large
part
of
it
at
least,
his
action
is
not
as
broad
as
the
other
two
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
w.
dickey
that
is
right
and
i
suggest
your
honor
that
his
action
is
redundant,
that
it
is
unnecessary.
that
in
this
case
he
is
looking
to
an
impoverish
estate
of
finance
a
litigation
which
need
not
be
brought
because
the
debenture
holders
are
in
both
the
state
court
and
the
federal
court
asserting
their
claims
vigorously.
discovery
has
been
had
in
one
of
those
cases.
the
case
is
farther
along
than
this
one
and
the
only
reason
it
is
not
farther
is
that
the
district
court
knowing
of
the
grant
of
certiorari
in
this
case
has
stayed
the
louis
federal
action
to
see
what
conclusions
are
reached
here.
and
i
suggest
your
honor
in
conclusion,
if
the
court
please
in
conclusion
that
we
are
opening
pandora’s
box
once
we
cross
the
initial
bridge
of
accepting
the
argument
that
is
made
here
and
the
claim
of
standing
because
we
have
no
answers
to
give
to
all
the
complex
of
