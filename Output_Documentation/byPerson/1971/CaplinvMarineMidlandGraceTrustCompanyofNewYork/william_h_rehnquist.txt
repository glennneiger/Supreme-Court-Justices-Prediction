mr.
miller,
is
that
your
contention
of
the
obligation
in
the
indenture
ran
to
the
benefit
of
the
debtor
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
miller,
would
you
concede
that
an
ordinary
trustee
and
bankruptcy
would
not
have
standing
to
bring
an
action
such
as
you
are
seeking
to
bring
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
the
only
basis
of
federal
jurisdiction
in
an
individual
debenture
holders
action
be
of
diversity?
would
that
be
the
only
way
he
could
get
in
to
federal
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
miller.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
referred
to
us
earlier
in
your
argument,
in
your
brief
to
11
u.s.c.
587,
which
in
turn
as
i
understand
refers
to
section
44
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
in
section
44,
the
bankruptcy
act
provides
for
the
appointment
of
a
trustee
in
an
ordinary
bankruptcy
proceeding
and
as
i
read
587,
it
says,
the
trustee
under
this
act
shall
have
the
same
powers
as
a
trustee
under
the
bankruptcy
act.
now,
if
a
trustee
under
the
bankruptcy
act
could
not
bring
this
action,
don’t
you
have
to
go
to
some
other
statutory
authority
to
show
that
your
reorganization
trustee
can
do
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
david
ferber,
in
the
mccandless
case
which
you
as
well
as
the
petitioner
rely
on,
there
it
actually
had
been
a
depletion
of
the
assets
of
the
debtors
as
a
result
of
the
conduct
sued
on
there,
hasn’t
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
did
any
assets
got
away
here?
i
mean,
isn’t
your
claim
against
the
indenture
trustee
just
that
he
did
not
recognize
the
fraudulent
representations
of
the
debtor
when
they
were
made.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
debtors
assets
were
dissipated
by
the
debtor.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
are
no
more
broke
after
they
issue
too
many
debentures
than
they
were
before
they
issue,
were
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
would
that
be
any
wrong
to
the
issuer
at
all?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
debtors
still
would
be
correspondingly
enlarged
or
at
least
prevented
from
being
drained?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
not
suggesting
that
the
individual
or
that
the
indenture
has
to
sue
in
the
reorganization
court,
are
you
