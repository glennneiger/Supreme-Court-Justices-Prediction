mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court.
as
senators
ervin
and
saxbe
have
indicated,
there
are
really
two
basic
issues
in
this
case.
one
issue
is
that
scope
of
the
speech
and
debate
clause,
that
is
the
kinds
of
activities
for
the
member
of
congress
which
are
privileged
under
the
clause
and
the
second
issue
was
whether
the
grand
jury
can
conduct
an
inquiry
into
these
activities
if
they
are
privileged.
i
would
like
to
spend
the
time
remaining
today,
to
talk
about
the
first
issue
and
in
particular
on
the
question
of
publication.
first
of
all
it
is
far
too
late
today
and
indeed
by
about
300
years
to
argue
that
the
free
speech
privilege
of
legislators
encompasses
only
speech
and
debate
in
the
literal
sense.
the
privilege
has
never
been
construed
that
way
in
america
or
in
england.
on
the
contrary
it
is
always
been
construed
broadly,
to
cover
all
functions
of
legislators,
which
are
necessary
to
fulfill
goals
of
representative
government
and
according
to
kilbourn
case
codified
that
by
saying,
those
customary
actions
of
members
of
congress
which
are
relative
to
the
legislative
process.
obviously
house
breaking
for
example,
isn't
related
to
legislative
process,
it
would
not
fulfill
any
goal
of
representative
government,
even
under
some
kind
of
claim
that
the
senator
needed
the
information.
but,
the
standard
that
we
were
suggesting
is
the
broad
standard
of
the
clause,
those
activities
necessary
to
fulfill
goals
of
representative
government,
is
we
think
the
only
kind
of
standard
which
meets
the
purposes
of
the
clause
and
the
senator
ervin
said,
so
well,
those
purposes
are
enforced
to
preserve
separation
of
powers
and
to
enable
a
representative
to
discharge
its
obligations
to
the
electorate
without
fear
of
either
executive
or
judicial
intrusions.
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
that's
right,
your
honor.
the
speech
or
debate
privilege
--
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
that's
right
your
honor,
it's
to
secure
the
rights
of
the
people
in
representative
government.
it
is
not
(inaudible)
of
an
office
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
status
of
the
individual.
it
is
to
preserve
the
rights
of
the
people.
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
yes
your
honor,
both
the
independence
and
the
integrity
of
an
independent
legislative
body.
therefore,
the
clause
does
cover
broadly
all
of
those
necessary
functions
and
we
think
it
is
also
a
little
too
late
in
the
day
to
argue
that
the
informing
function
of
congress
does
not
fall
within
that
category.
in
our
system
of
government
the
because
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
people,
because
of
the
necessity
of
securing
the
rights
of
the
people,
representatives
have
a
duty,
they
have
an
obligation
to
inform
their
colleagues
and
their
constituents
and
the
public
at
large,
about
matters
of
public
importance
and
specifically
as
woodrow
wilson
said
in
his
classic
study
on
congress,
specifically
about
executive
conduct
in
both
domestic
and
foreign
policy.
this
obligation
does
not
only
derive
from
the
fact
that
the
people
must
be
able
to
have
this
information
in
order
to
govern
themselves
intelligently,
but
it
is
also
from
a
perception
about
the
very
operation
of
the
legislative
process
and
that
is
the
people
must
have
this
information
in
order
to
inform
--
in
turn
inform
their
representatives
of
their
well
considered
views
on
pending
and
potential
legislations.
what
this
is
an
interplay
and
i
think
your
honors
that
practically
every
congressman
from
the
birth
of
the
republic
has
recognized
this
that
there
must
be
an
interplay
between
a
representative
and
the
people
and
that
this
interplay
is
the
bed
rock,
the
heart
of
our
system
of
a
representative
government.
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
the
question
there
your
honor
in
the
securing
information
for
the
subpoena
power
of
congress,
is
whether
or
not
there
is
an
executive
privilege
implied
in
article
1,
to
prohibit
this
power,
to
prohibit
the
scope
of
the
subpoena.
this
is
never
really
been
decided
by
this
court.
there
is
of
course
an
article
1
enumerated
executive
privilege.
it
has
been
implied
in
the
constitution
by
–
at
least
as
has
been
arguably
implied
because
many
presidents
have
asserted
the
privilege
and
one
would
get
into
a
conflict
there
between
two
constitutional
privileges.
one
the
privilege
of
congress
to
obtain
information
and
the
second
the
privilege
of
the
executive
branch
so
withhold
information
from
congress,
it's
a
difficult
problem.
we
don't
have
any
kind
of
conflict
of
that
sort
here.
what
we
have
here
is
a
member
of
congress,
who
has
information
critical
of
executive
conduct
in
foreign
policy
making
not
available
to
the
people
of
united
states
through
the
holding
of
the
subcommittee
and
through
the
publication
material.
and
this
is
exactly
the
kind
of
conduct
that
is
fallen
within
the
mainstream
of
the
hardcore
purpose
of
the
speech
and
debate
clause.
the
privilege
both
in
england
and
america
arose
in
order
to
allow
unrestrained
criticism
by
members
of
congress
of
the
administration.
we
don't
have
here
a
civil
case,
where
an
individual
claims
that
his
constitutional
rights
are
being
violated,
willfully
by
a
member
of
congress.
those
cases
have
been
before
this
court.
normally
you
have
a
case
here
of
bribed
congressmen,
who
argues
a
separation
of
power
theory
in
some
attenuated
fashion.
what
we
have
here
is
a
situation
of
united
states
senator
who
is
criticizing
the
executive
about
matters
of
overwhelming
public
importance,
and
if
this
kind
of
conduct
is
not
protected
by
the
constitution
then
the
promise
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause
which
is
as
mr.
justice
brennan
and
the
chief
justice
have
said,
to
preserve
the
independence
and
the
integrity
of
the
legislature,
than
that
promise
is
illusionary.
now
i
don't
want
the
court
to
think
that
we
are
making
a
novel
argument
here.
in
fact
the
free
speech
privilege
of
both
england
and
america
we
think
that
there
is
overwhelming
evidence
to
support
the
proposition
that
these
privileges
were
designed
specifically
to
enable
members
of
congress
to
inform
the
electorate
about
executive
behavior,
and
specifically
through
the
publication
of
committee
records.
the
english
bill
of
rights
resulted
from
a
notorious
prosecution
of
the
speaker
of
the
house
of
commons,
who
assert
--
who
had
privately
printed
and
distributed
a
committee
record,
accusing
the
king
of
malfeasance
in
office
and
that
led
to
the
exile
of
james
ii
and
the
enactment
of
first
free
speech
privilege
and
historians
are
unanimous
and
concluding
that
the
very
purpose
of
the
codification
was
to
bring
publication
within
it.
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
no
your
honor
we
do
not
think
so.
the
court
of
appeals
felt
that
there
might
be
a
common
law
privilege
akin
to
the
executive
privilege,
but
we
think
that
the
speech
or
debate
clause
itself
is
adequate
and
that
no
additional
privilege
need
to
be
implied
or
created
out
the
common
law.
in
our
own
country
thomas
jefferson
and
james
madison
both
articulated
the
view
very
eloquently
that
the
free
speech
privilege
covered
communications
from
a
member
of
congress
to
its
constituents
in
the
form
of
newsletters
or
anything
else.
there
was
a
grand
jury
investigation
during
a
reign
of
the
(inaudible)
laws
fairly
similar
to
this
one,
the
claim
of
the
executive
laws
that
members
of
congress
were
giving
aid
and
comfort
to
enemies
of
the
united
states
and
jefferson
condemned
that
investigation
as
a
blatant
violation
of
privilege.
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
your
honors
will
recall
before
the
recess
yesterday,
we
were
discussing,
whether
or
not,
publication
of
a
subcommittee
record
by
senator
gravel
is
protected
by
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
we
then
demonstrated
that
the
clause
has
always
been
read
broadly
to
cover
all
necessary
functions
of
legislators.
that
the
informing
function
for
congress
is
precisely
just
such
an
essential
function
of
legislators
and
that
the
publication
of
the
subcommittee
record
is
a
classic
example
of
the
exercise
of
the
informing
function.
there
is
much
historical
evidence
for
this
proposition.
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
yes,
your
honor.
we
are
not
arguing
in
this
case
that
anyone
is
unaccountable
except
senator
gravel.
we
are
not
arguing
that
aides
are
unaccountable
or
that
printers
are
unaccountable
for
what
they
did.
we
have
all
along
throughout
this
proceedings,
your
honor,
treated
this
as
a
matter
of
testimonial
privilege.
our
contention
is
that
the
grand
jury
cannot
inquire
into
the
privileged
legislative
conduct
of
senator
gravel.
now
whether
anyone
can
be
invited
or
prosecuted
is
another
matter.
if
that
occurs,
the
court
would
then
deal
with
it.
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
well,
your
honor,
if
senator
gravel
were
engaging
in
privilege
conduct,
then
it
necessarily
follows
that
he
himself
is
immune
from
criminal
prosecution
as
well
as
inquiry.
it
does
not
necessarily
follow
that
anyone
else
is,
but
as
the
clause
is
always
been
construed,
the
privilege
for
the
legislator
himself
is
both
with
respect
to
inquiry
and
with
respect
to
accountability.
now
if
for
example,
beacon
press
were
prosecuted,
the
court
would
then
have
to
face
the
question
as
english
courts
have
had
to,
of
whether
printers
of
parliamentary
proceedings
to
assist
senators
are
immune.
the
english
courts
have
said,
yes,
but
that
question
is
not
presented
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
no,
your
honor,
our
privilege
is
just
with
respect
to
activity
which
are
legislative
acts.
for
example,
we
do
not
consider
stealing
to
be
a
legislative
act.
we
do
consider
the
holding
of
a
subcommittee
hearing
--
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
yes
your
honor.
he
could
be
asked
whether
a
senator
stole
something.
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
well,
whether
or
not,
it's
a
difficult
question
of
whether
or
not
it's
a
crime.
i
was
thinking
of
something,
stealing
perhaps
a
car,
for
example,
when
you’re
talking
about
stealing
government
property,
you
do
have
a
difficulty
of
who
the
government
property
is
--
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
well,
no
your
honor,
there’s
no
claim
here,
that's
senator
gravel
or
anybody
working
for
him
stole
the
pentagon
papers.
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
your
honor,
the
first
time
we
saw
that
issue
in
this
case
was
in
the
solicitor
general’s
reply
--
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
before
this
–
the
aide
joined
the
--
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
yes.
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
no,
that
inquiry
could
go
forward.
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
that's
correct.
now
the
acquisition
of
the
papers
by
senator
gravel,
we
consider
to
be,
excuse
me,
another
story,
unless
he
participated
in
a
theft,
but
when
one
is
talking
about
the
mere
receipt
of
the
information
by
a
legislator,
that
would
fall
within
the
category
of
legislative
acts,
but
we
have
never
said,
that
dr.
rodberg
cannot
be
inquired
into
for
what
he
did
before
he
joined
senator
gravel’s
staff.
in
fact
--
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
that's
precisely
correct,
your
honor.
the
district
court
found
as
a
fact
that
the
purpose
of
the
inquiry,
dr.
rodberg,
was
to
ask
him
about
the
preparation
for
the
subcommittee
hearing,
the
holding
of
the
hearing
and
the
publication
of
the
documents,
the
subcommittee
records.
that
finding
was
not
challenged
by
the
government
on
appeal
and
it
wasn't
for
the
very
simple
reason
that
senator
gravel
possessed
the
documents,
many
days
before
he
met
or
even
heard
of
dr.
leonard
rodberg.
dr.
rodberg
was
hired
especially
well
after
the
senator
received
--
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
no,
your
honor,
we
do
not,
that
was
made
clear
in
the
johnson
case.
interceding
before
executive
agencies
is
not
a
legislative
act
because
the
legislator
is
going
outside
of
his
domain
and
he
is
interfering
into
conduct
which
is
vested
by
law
and
by
the
constitution
of
the
court
and
branches
of
the
executive
and
the
judicial
entities.
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
there
might
be
some
first
amendment
cases,
but
they
would
not
be
within
the
privilege.
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
mr.
justice
white,
we
do
not
think
that
dr.
rodberg
has
any
independent
privilege
or
anyone
else
in
this
case.
we
think
the
privilege
is
senator
gravel’s
and
in
order
to
forbid
inquiry
into
senator
gravel’s
legislative
acts,
we
think
it
cannot
be
done
through
the
interrogation
of
those
persons
who
assisted
him
in
the
performance
of
those
legislative
acts.
just
like
the
attorney
client
privilege,
that
belongs
to
your
client,
no
one
would
say,
it's
the
attorney’s
privilege,
but
it
can
be
defeated
by
questioning
the
attorney.
the
(inaudible)
privilege
is
exactly
the
same.
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
well
as
i
said,
mr.
chief
justice
there
was
a
finding
by
judge
garrity
and
judge
garrity
based
that
finding
on
some
evidence
was
introduced
by
dr.
rodberg.
our
allegation
is
the
fact
that
they
were
not
denied
by
the
government,
not
only
that
but
the
government
went
ahead
and
said,
we
will
make
these
allegations
the
basis
of
our
legal
assumptions
and
refused
to
deny
it.
we
did
offer
the
government
an
opportunity
to
specify
that
the
inquiry
would
go
into
non-legislative
activities.
we
asked
the
government
to
make
such
a
specification.
the
government
declined
to
do
so
and
instead
the
government
just
proceeded
in
that
way.
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
yes,
thats
why
we've
asked
for
protective
orders,
only
prohibiting
those
questions
which
are
within
the
privilege.
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
yes,
your
honor,
that's
why
we’re
arguing
the
publication
case
here.
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
well,
your
honor,
a
protective
order
which
says
that,
if
dr.
rodberg
may
not
be
asked
questions
about
preparation
for
the
hearing
and
the
holding
of
the
hearing
and
the
publication
of
the
record
which
seem
to
me
be
pretty
easily
enforceable.
we
did
ask
for
a
specification
of
questions
in
advance
because
of
the
kind
of
enforcement
problems
that
we
have,
because
senator
gravel
isn't
there.
but
we
were
persuaded
by
the
district
court
and
by
the
court
of
appeals,
that
a
protective
order
would
be
adequate.
the
dilemma
of
course
is,
that
it
is
senator
gravel’s
privilege
and
he
must
have
some
mechanism
of
enforcing
it.
he
can't
rely
on
other
people
to
make
a
decision
to
perhaps
risk
contempt
in
order
to
vindicate
his
own
privilege.
now
the
specification
technique
of
--
to
which
i
am
alluding
has
been
used
by
the
government
before
in
privilege
cases,
such
as
husband-wife
privilege
case
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
was
a
fairly
specific
specification
in
the
caldwell
case
of
what
kinds
of
questions
were
going
to
be
asked
to
mr.
caldwell,
but
we
think
that
a
general
protective
order
dealing
with
the
acquisition
by
senator
gravel
on
the
receipt,
the
preparation
for
the
subcommittee
hearing,
the
holding
and
publication
is
cleanly
sufficient.
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
yes,
your
honor,
he
is
a
doctor.
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it
will
be
proper
to
go
into
it
very
deeply.
i
will
say
that
dr.
rodberg's
credentials
are
set
out
in
an
amicus
brief,
which
he
has
filed.
senator
gravel
was
interested
in
finding
someone
who
had
specialty
in
foreign
relations.
this
is
not
at
all
unusual
to
hire
someone
specially.
it
doesn't
make
much
sense,
we
don't
think
to
hire
an
aide
six
months
before
you
need
him.
senator
gravel
looked
very
hard
for
someone
with
dr.
rodberg's
credentials
and
he
hired
him
at
that
time.
all
of
this
occurred
after
senator
gravel
obtained
the
material.
i'm
very
reluctant
to
go
into
it
any
deeper
because
we
are
in
very
delicate
position
that
apparently
the
grand
jury
would
like
to
find
out
this
information
and
we
consider
a
lot
of
privilege.
now
what
the
solicitor
general
is
suggesting
--
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
your
honor,
i
would
--
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
dr.
rodberg
is
not
on
the
payroll,
and
i
would
prefer
not
to
get
into
the
financial
arrangements
which
have
been
made.
there
was
an
affidavit
by
the
sergeant-at-arms
who
is
the
official
record
keeper
of
the
senate,
that
dr.
rodberg
is
one
of
the
staff
of
senator
gravel.
senator
gravel's
staff
by
the
way
is
not
very
large.
i
think
he
only
has
six
aides.
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
that's
right,
your
honor.
we
do
not
think
that
the
grand
jury
can
inquire
into
the
privilege
acts.
the
congress
in
turn
interrogating
people
who
assisted
him,
whether
they
happen
to
be
employees
of
his
or
not.
there
is
a
particular
--
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
no,
your
honor.
if
the
congressman
asks
someone
for
advice
on
how
to
vote
on
pending
legislation,
the
position
of
the
solicitor
general
is
that
this
person
can
be
subpoenaed
before
the
grand
jury
and
asked
what
advice
did
you
give
to
the
senator
and
what
did
the
senator
tell
you.
we
think
that
will
be
a
blatant
violation
of
separation
of
powers
and
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
that's
right,
but
we're
--
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
no,
your
honor
that's
correct,
there's
no
issue
on
that.
however,
there
is
also
a
proposed
interrogation
of
people
who
assisted
the
senator
in
printing
the
record.
those
people
historically
have
been
considered
very
important
in
assisting
senators
and
congressmen
in
performing
their
informing
functions.
we
don't
think
that
they
could
be
interrogated
either.
your
honor
is
quite
correct
in
the
hypothetical
that
you
pose
that,
that
will
be
very
different,
but
that's
because
barrage
undetected
by
the
clause,
so
it'll
be
a
reason
for
that.
your
honor,
i
see
my
time
is
up.
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court.
as
senators
ervin
and
saxbe
have
indicated,
there
are
really
two
basic
issues
in
this
case.
one
issue
is
that
scope
of
the
speech
and
debate
clause,
that
is
the
kinds
of
activities
for
the
member
of
congress
which
are
privileged
under
the
clause
and
the
second
issue
was
whether
the
grand
jury
can
conduct
an
inquiry
into
these
activities
if
they
are
privileged.
i
would
like
to
spend
the
time
remaining
today,
to
talk
about
the
first
issue
and
in
particular
on
the
question
of
publication.
first
of
all
it
is
far
too
late
today
and
indeed
by
about
300
years
to
argue
that
the
free
speech
privilege
of
legislators
encompasses
only
speech
and
debate
in
the
literal
sense.
the
privilege
has
never
been
construed
that
way
in
america
or
in
england.
on
the
contrary
it
is
always
been
construed
broadly,
to
cover
all
functions
of
legislators,
which
are
necessary
to
fulfill
goals
of
representative
government
and
according
to
kilbourn
case
codified
that
by
saying,
those
customary
actions
of
members
of
congress
which
are
relative
to
the
legislative
process.
obviously
house
breaking
for
example,
isn't
related
to
legislative
process,
it
would
not
fulfill
any
goal
of
representative
government,
even
under
some
kind
of
claim
that
the
senator
needed
the
information.
but,
the
standard
that
we
were
suggesting
is
the
broad
standard
of
the
clause,
those
activities
necessary
to
fulfill
goals
of
representative
government,
is
we
think
the
only
kind
of
standard
which
meets
the
purposes
of
the
clause
and
the
senator
ervin
said,
so
well,
those
purposes
are
enforced
to
preserve
separation
of
powers
and
to
enable
a
representative
to
discharge
its
obligations
to
the
electorate
without
fear
of
either
executive
or
judicial
intrusions.
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
that's
right,
your
honor.
the
speech
or
debate
privilege
--
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
that's
right
your
honor,
it's
to
secure
the
rights
of
the
people
in
representative
government.
it
is
not
(inaudible)
of
an
office
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
status
of
the
individual.
it
is
to
preserve
the
rights
of
the
people.
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
yes
your
honor,
both
the
independence
and
the
integrity
of
an
independent
legislative
body.
therefore,
the
clause
does
cover
broadly
all
of
those
necessary
functions
and
we
think
it
is
also
a
little
too
late
in
the
day
to
argue
that
the
informing
function
of
congress
does
not
fall
within
that
category.
in
our
system
of
government
the
because
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
people,
because
of
the
necessity
of
securing
the
rights
of
the
people,
representatives
have
a
duty,
they
have
an
obligation
to
inform
their
colleagues
and
their
constituents
and
the
public
at
large,
about
matters
of
public
importance
and
specifically
as
woodrow
wilson
said
in
his
classic
study
on
congress,
specifically
about
executive
conduct
in
both
domestic
and
foreign
policy.
this
obligation
does
not
only
derive
from
the
fact
that
the
people
must
be
able
to
have
this
information
in
order
to
govern
themselves
intelligently,
but
it
is
also
from
a
perception
about
the
very
operation
of
the
legislative
process
and
that
is
the
people
must
have
this
information
in
order
to
inform
--
in
turn
inform
their
representatives
of
their
well
considered
views
on
pending
and
potential
legislations.
what
this
is
an
interplay
and
i
think
your
honors
that
practically
every
congressman
from
the
birth
of
the
republic
has
recognized
this
that
there
must
be
an
interplay
between
a
representative
and
the
people
and
that
this
interplay
is
the
bed
rock,
the
heart
of
our
system
of
a
representative
government.
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
the
question
there
your
honor
in
the
securing
information
for
the
subpoena
power
of
congress,
is
whether
or
not
there
is
an
executive
privilege
implied
in
article
1,
to
prohibit
this
power,
to
prohibit
the
scope
of
the
subpoena.
this
is
never
really
been
decided
by
this
court.
there
is
of
course
an
article
1
enumerated
executive
privilege.
it
has
been
implied
in
the
constitution
by
–
at
least
as
has
been
arguably
implied
because
many
presidents
have
asserted
the
privilege
and
one
would
get
into
a
conflict
there
between
two
constitutional
privileges.
one
the
privilege
of
congress
to
obtain
information
and
the
second
the
privilege
of
the
executive
branch
so
withhold
information
from
congress,
it's
a
difficult
problem.
we
don't
have
any
kind
of
conflict
of
that
sort
here.
what
we
have
here
is
a
member
of
congress,
who
has
information
critical
of
executive
conduct
in
foreign
policy
making
not
available
to
the
people
of
united
states
through
the
holding
of
the
subcommittee
and
through
the
publication
material.
and
this
is
exactly
the
kind
of
conduct
that
is
fallen
within
the
mainstream
of
the
hardcore
purpose
of
the
speech
and
debate
clause.
the
privilege
both
in
england
and
america
arose
in
order
to
allow
unrestrained
criticism
by
members
of
congress
of
the
administration.
we
don't
have
here
a
civil
case,
where
an
individual
claims
that
his
constitutional
rights
are
being
violated,
willfully
by
a
member
of
congress.
those
cases
have
been
before
this
court.
normally
you
have
a
case
here
of
bribed
congressmen,
who
argues
a
separation
of
power
theory
in
some
attenuated
fashion.
what
we
have
here
is
a
situation
of
united
states
senator
who
is
criticizing
the
executive
about
matters
of
overwhelming
public
importance,
and
if
this
kind
of
conduct
is
not
protected
by
the
constitution
then
the
promise
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause
which
is
as
mr.
justice
brennan
and
the
chief
justice
have
said,
to
preserve
the
independence
and
the
integrity
of
the
legislature,
than
that
promise
is
illusionary.
now
i
don't
want
the
court
to
think
that
we
are
making
a
novel
argument
here.
in
fact
the
free
speech
privilege
of
both
england
and
america
we
think
that
there
is
overwhelming
evidence
to
support
the
proposition
that
these
privileges
were
designed
specifically
to
enable
members
of
congress
to
inform
the
electorate
about
executive
behavior,
and
specifically
through
the
publication
of
committee
records.
the
english
bill
of
rights
resulted
from
a
notorious
prosecution
of
the
speaker
of
the
house
of
commons,
who
assert
--
who
had
privately
printed
and
distributed
a
committee
record,
accusing
the
king
of
malfeasance
in
office
and
that
led
to
the
exile
of
james
ii
and
the
enactment
of
first
free
speech
privilege
and
historians
are
unanimous
and
concluding
that
the
very
purpose
of
the
codification
was
to
bring
publication
within
it.
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
no
your
honor
we
do
not
think
so.
the
court
of
appeals
felt
that
there
might
be
a
common
law
privilege
akin
to
the
executive
privilege,
but
we
think
that
the
speech
or
debate
clause
itself
is
adequate
and
that
no
additional
privilege
need
to
be
implied
or
created
out
the
common
law.
in
our
own
country
thomas
jefferson
and
james
madison
both
articulated
the
view
very
eloquently
that
the
free
speech
privilege
covered
communications
from
a
member
of
congress
to
its
constituents
in
the
form
of
newsletters
or
anything
else.
there
was
a
grand
jury
investigation
during
a
reign
of
the
(inaudible)
laws
fairly
similar
to
this
one,
the
claim
of
the
executive
laws
that
members
of
congress
were
giving
aid
and
comfort
to
enemies
of
the
united
states
and
jefferson
condemned
that
investigation
as
a
blatant
violation
of
privilege.
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
your
honors
will
recall
before
the
recess
yesterday,
we
were
discussing,
whether
or
not,
publication
of
a
subcommittee
record
by
senator
gravel
is
protected
by
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
we
then
demonstrated
that
the
clause
has
always
been
read
broadly
to
cover
all
necessary
functions
of
legislators.
that
the
informing
function
for
congress
is
precisely
just
such
an
essential
function
of
legislators
and
that
the
publication
of
the
subcommittee
record
is
a
classic
example
of
the
exercise
of
the
informing
function.
there
is
much
historical
evidence
for
this
proposition.
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
yes,
your
honor.
we
are
not
arguing
in
this
case
that
anyone
is
unaccountable
except
senator
gravel.
we
are
not
arguing
that
aides
are
unaccountable
or
that
printers
are
unaccountable
for
what
they
did.
we
have
all
along
throughout
this
proceedings,
your
honor,
treated
this
as
a
matter
of
testimonial
privilege.
our
contention
is
that
the
grand
jury
cannot
inquire
into
the
privileged
legislative
conduct
of
senator
gravel.
now
whether
anyone
can
be
invited
or
prosecuted
is
another
matter.
if
that
occurs,
the
court
would
then
deal
with
it.
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
well,
your
honor,
if
senator
gravel
were
engaging
in
privilege
conduct,
then
it
necessarily
follows
that
he
himself
is
immune
from
criminal
prosecution
as
well
as
inquiry.
it
does
not
necessarily
follow
that
anyone
else
is,
but
as
the
clause
is
always
been
construed,
the
privilege
for
the
legislator
himself
is
both
with
respect
to
inquiry
and
with
respect
to
accountability.
now
if
for
example,
beacon
press
were
prosecuted,
the
court
would
then
have
to
face
the
question
as
english
courts
have
had
to,
of
whether
printers
of
parliamentary
proceedings
to
assist
senators
are
immune.
the
english
courts
have
said,
yes,
but
that
question
is
not
presented
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
no,
your
honor,
our
privilege
is
just
with
respect
to
activity
which
are
legislative
acts.
for
example,
we
do
not
consider
stealing
to
be
a
legislative
act.
we
do
consider
the
holding
of
a
subcommittee
hearing
--
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
yes
your
honor.
he
could
be
asked
whether
a
senator
stole
something.
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
well,
whether
or
not,
it's
a
difficult
question
of
whether
or
not
it's
a
crime.
i
was
thinking
of
something,
stealing
perhaps
a
car,
for
example,
when
you’re
talking
about
stealing
government
property,
you
do
have
a
difficulty
of
who
the
government
property
is
--
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
well,
no
your
honor,
there’s
no
claim
here,
that's
senator
gravel
or
anybody
working
for
him
stole
the
pentagon
papers.
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
your
honor,
the
first
time
we
saw
that
issue
in
this
case
was
in
the
solicitor
general’s
reply
--
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
before
this
–
the
aide
joined
the
--
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
yes.
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
no,
that
inquiry
could
go
forward.
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
that's
correct.
now
the
acquisition
of
the
papers
by
senator
gravel,
we
consider
to
be,
excuse
me,
another
story,
unless
he
participated
in
a
theft,
but
when
one
is
talking
about
the
mere
receipt
of
the
information
by
a
legislator,
that
would
fall
within
the
category
of
legislative
acts,
but
we
have
never
said,
that
dr.
rodberg
cannot
be
inquired
into
for
what
he
did
before
he
joined
senator
gravel’s
staff.
in
fact
--
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
that's
precisely
correct,
your
honor.
the
district
court
found
as
a
fact
that
the
purpose
of
the
inquiry,
dr.
rodberg,
was
to
ask
him
about
the
preparation
for
the
subcommittee
hearing,
the
holding
of
the
hearing
and
the
publication
of
the
documents,
the
subcommittee
records.
that
finding
was
not
challenged
by
the
government
on
appeal
and
it
wasn't
for
the
very
simple
reason
that
senator
gravel
possessed
the
documents,
many
days
before
he
met
or
even
heard
of
dr.
leonard
rodberg.
dr.
rodberg
was
hired
especially
well
after
the
senator
received
--
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
no,
your
honor,
we
do
not,
that
was
made
clear
in
the
johnson
case.
interceding
before
executive
agencies
is
not
a
legislative
act
because
the
legislator
is
going
outside
of
his
domain
and
he
is
interfering
into
conduct
which
is
vested
by
law
and
by
the
constitution
of
the
court
and
branches
of
the
executive
and
the
judicial
entities.
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
there
might
be
some
first
amendment
cases,
but
they
would
not
be
within
the
privilege.
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
mr.
justice
white,
we
do
not
think
that
dr.
rodberg
has
any
independent
privilege
or
anyone
else
in
this
case.
we
think
the
privilege
is
senator
gravel’s
and
in
order
to
forbid
inquiry
into
senator
gravel’s
legislative
acts,
we
think
it
cannot
be
done
through
the
interrogation
of
those
persons
who
assisted
him
in
the
performance
of
those
legislative
acts.
just
like
the
attorney
client
privilege,
that
belongs
to
your
client,
no
one
would
say,
it's
the
attorney’s
privilege,
but
it
can
be
defeated
by
questioning
the
attorney.
the
(inaudible)
privilege
is
exactly
the
same.
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
well
as
i
said,
mr.
chief
justice
there
was
a
finding
by
judge
garrity
and
judge
garrity
based
that
finding
on
some
evidence
was
introduced
by
dr.
rodberg.
our
allegation
is
the
fact
that
they
were
not
denied
by
the
government,
not
only
that
but
the
government
went
ahead
and
said,
we
will
make
these
allegations
the
basis
of
our
legal
assumptions
and
refused
to
deny
it.
we
did
offer
the
government
an
opportunity
to
specify
that
the
inquiry
would
go
into
non-legislative
activities.
we
asked
the
government
to
make
such
a
specification.
the
government
declined
to
do
so
and
instead
the
government
just
proceeded
in
that
way.
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
yes,
thats
why
we've
asked
for
protective
orders,
only
prohibiting
those
questions
which
are
within
the
privilege.
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
yes,
your
honor,
that's
why
we’re
arguing
the
publication
case
here.
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
well,
your
honor,
a
protective
order
which
says
that,
if
dr.
rodberg
may
not
be
asked
questions
about
preparation
for
the
hearing
and
the
holding
of
the
hearing
and
the
publication
of
the
record
which
seem
to
me
be
pretty
easily
enforceable.
we
did
ask
for
a
specification
of
questions
in
advance
because
of
the
kind
of
enforcement
problems
that
we
have,
because
senator
gravel
isn't
there.
but
we
were
persuaded
by
the
district
court
and
by
the
court
of
appeals,
that
a
protective
order
would
be
adequate.
the
dilemma
of
course
is,
that
it
is
senator
gravel’s
privilege
and
he
must
have
some
mechanism
of
enforcing
it.
he
can't
rely
on
other
people
to
make
a
decision
to
perhaps
risk
contempt
in
order
to
vindicate
his
own
privilege.
now
the
specification
technique
of
--
to
which
i
am
alluding
has
been
used
by
the
government
before
in
privilege
cases,
such
as
husband-wife
privilege
case
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
was
a
fairly
specific
specification
in
the
caldwell
case
of
what
kinds
of
questions
were
going
to
be
asked
to
mr.
caldwell,
but
we
think
that
a
general
protective
order
dealing
with
the
acquisition
by
senator
gravel
on
the
receipt,
the
preparation
for
the
subcommittee
hearing,
the
holding
and
publication
is
cleanly
sufficient.
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
yes,
your
honor,
he
is
a
doctor.
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it
will
be
proper
to
go
into
it
very
deeply.
i
will
say
that
dr.
rodberg's
credentials
are
set
out
in
an
amicus
brief,
which
he
has
filed.
senator
gravel
was
interested
in
finding
someone
who
had
specialty
in
foreign
relations.
this
is
not
at
all
unusual
to
hire
someone
specially.
it
doesn't
make
much
sense,
we
don't
think
to
hire
an
aide
six
months
before
you
need
him.
senator
gravel
looked
very
hard
for
someone
with
dr.
rodberg's
credentials
and
he
hired
him
at
that
time.
all
of
this
occurred
after
senator
gravel
obtained
the
material.
i'm
very
reluctant
to
go
into
it
any
deeper
because
we
are
in
very
delicate
position
that
apparently
the
grand
jury
would
like
to
find
out
this
information
and
we
consider
a
lot
of
privilege.
now
what
the
solicitor
general
is
suggesting
--
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
your
honor,
i
would
--
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
dr.
rodberg
is
not
on
the
payroll,
and
i
would
prefer
not
to
get
into
the
financial
arrangements
which
have
been
made.
there
was
an
affidavit
by
the
sergeant-at-arms
who
is
the
official
record
keeper
of
the
senate,
that
dr.
rodberg
is
one
of
the
staff
of
senator
gravel.
senator
gravel's
staff
by
the
way
is
not
very
large.
i
think
he
only
has
six
aides.
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
that's
right,
your
honor.
we
do
not
think
that
the
grand
jury
can
inquire
into
the
privilege
acts.
the
congress
in
turn
interrogating
people
who
assisted
him,
whether
they
happen
to
be
employees
of
his
or
not.
there
is
a
particular
--
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
no,
your
honor.
if
the
congressman
asks
someone
for
advice
on
how
to
vote
on
pending
legislation,
the
position
of
the
solicitor
general
is
that
this
person
can
be
subpoenaed
before
the
grand
jury
and
asked
what
advice
did
you
give
to
the
senator
and
what
did
the
senator
tell
you.
we
think
that
will
be
a
blatant
violation
of
separation
of
powers
and
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
that's
right,
but
we're
--
mr.
robert
j.
reinstein
no,
your
honor
that's
correct,
there's
no
issue
on
that.
however,
there
is
also
a
proposed
interrogation
of
people
who
assisted
the
senator
in
printing
the
record.
those
people
historically
have
been
considered
very
important
in
assisting
senators
and
congressmen
in
performing
their
informing
functions.
we
don't
think
that
they
could
be
interrogated
either.
your
honor
is
quite
correct
in
the
hypothetical
that
you
pose
that,
that
will
be
very
different,
but
that's
because
barrage
undetected
by
the
clause,
so
it'll
be
a
reason
for
that.
your
honor,
i
see
my
time
is
up.
