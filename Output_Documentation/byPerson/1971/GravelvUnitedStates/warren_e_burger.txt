gravel

and

consolidated.
chief

warren
e.

just
let
the
crowd
to
clear
a
little
bit.
we
have
got
all
the
power
lawyers
in
wahsington
based
senator.
senator
ervin.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
this
circumstance
arising
simply
out
of
the
fact
that
it
--
this
was
a
very
hasty
development?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
while
we
have
you
stopped
senator,
with
the
immunity
that
you
have
just
suggested
to
be
broad
enough
so
that
no
inquiry
could
be
made
judicially
or
otherwise
into
whether
meeting
was
a
valid
meeting
under
the
senate
rules?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
that
would
be
the
business
only
of
the
senate?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
senator
i
am
not
sure
it's
relevant
here
but
you
may
shed
some
light
on
it
for
me.
suppose
in
--
a
session
of
the
congress
was
held
here,
extraordinary
kind
of
meeting,
a
libel
was
committed
on
an
individual.
could
that
individual
in
a
suit
for
libel
or
slander,
should
it
be
that
broad,
could
he
question
the
validity
on
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then
that
would
be
the
question
in
the
case
whether
it
was
within
the
legislative
function?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
can
finish
senator.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
you
have
a
question
over
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
you
illustrate
that
a
little
bit
senator?
suppose
he
calls
on
professor
of
economics
at
some
university,
doesn't
hire
him,
doesn't
appoint
him,
just
write
some
of
letter
and
says,
would
you
give
me
your
views
about
this,
would
you
regard
that
person
whom
he
is
consulting
as
with
in
the
immunity
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
senator
ervin.
senator
saxbe,
you
have
10
minutes,
we'll
charge
the
extra
time
court
[attempt
to
laughter]
and
add
that
to
solicitor
general's
time.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
when
you
say,
deliver
up
to,
is
open
season,
in
fact
they
don't
have
to
deliver
him
really
--
you
mean
he
is
not
covered
by
the
immunity?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
you
are
saying
perhaps
is,
that
house
breaking
is
house
breaking
and
members
of
congress
have
no
immunity
to
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
senator
saxbe.
mr.
solicitor
general,
would
you
prefer
not
to
divide,
is
counsel
going
to
engage
only
in
rebuttal.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh!
excuse
me,
mr.
reinstein,
you
may
proceed.
you
might
want
to
plan
your
argument
by
having
in
mind
that
we
will
have
about
7
minutes
now
and
whatever
the
balance
is
in
morning.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
another
way
to
say
that
i
suppose
is
that
it's
to
preserve
the
integrity
of
an
independent
legislative
body,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
think
that's
right
enough
so
that
the
committee
of
the
congress
for
example,
could
subpoena
all
of
the
contingency
military
and
defense
plans
from
the
department
of
defense
where
the
joint
chiefs
of
staff
come
over
and
testify
about
their
contingency
plans?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
do
you
have
to
go
beyond
the
speech
or
debate
clause
for
purposes
of
your
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there
in
the
morning
mr.
reinstein.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
can
you
determine
the
scope
of
the
privilege
until
you
know
what
question
is
to
be
put.
i
am
speaking
now
with
reference
to
the
assistant,
the
aide,
the
staff
member?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
but,
the
point,
i
am
raising
to
you
is
this,
may
it
not
be
that
many
questions
might
be
put
to
him
that
would
be
concededly
beyond
the
privilege
and
that
he
would
have
no
objection
to
answering?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
someoneâ€™s
got
to
define
the
privilege
of
course?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
but
that
definition
has
got
to
be
decided
with
reference
to
each
question,
isn't
that
not
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
solicitor
general
under
the
johnson
case,
would
it
be
theoretically
at
least
true
that
if
an
indictment
charged
a
member
of
either
house
with
some
crime
related
to
making
the
speech,
making
the
speech
for
a
bribe
for
example,
that
the
member
could
if
he
wanted
to
take
the
risk
simply
refuse
to
appear,
refuse
to
answer
and
let
the
case
go
against
him
by
default
and
then
stand
on
the
privilege?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
why
i
put
in
the
term
feel
theoretically
he
could
even
refuse
to
answer
if
you
take
the
literal
language
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
solicitor
general
--
finish.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
dombrowski
against
eastland,
who
was
the
particular
aide
with
that
this
court
said
had
no
immunity?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
was
the
legal
advisor
to
the
chairman
and
of
the
judiciary
committee
and
to
the
entire
judiciary
committee,
was
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then
this
court
held
he
had
no
immunity,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
when
mr.
sourwine
got
to
trial
day
in
those
cases,
then
he
would
be
required
to
take
the
stand
and
to
answer
questions,
would
he
not
under
the
civil
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
solicitor
general,
do
you
think
congress
could
enact
a
statue
giving
some
kind
of
limited
privilege
to
its
own
staff
members
without
running
afoul
to
any
constitution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
state
legislative
had
granted
such
immunities
to
doctors
and
lawyers
and
ministers?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
solicitor
general.
mr.
fishman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
define
what
legislative
proceeding
you
are
referring
to
when
you
use
the
term
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
by
whom?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
the
official
channels
of
congress
or
elsewhere.
i
understood
the
statement
was
made
that
the
committee,
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
the
senate
in
particular
refused
the
funds
for
publication
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it
must
be
well
known
whether
or
not
the
committee
has
actually
published
one
of
the
usual
reports,
embracing
all
this
material?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
as
i
understand
the
inquiry
that
the
solicitor
general
said
the
government
wants
to
make
is
to
determine
whether
any
crime
was
committed
in
the
acquisition
of
those
documents?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
fishman,
for
your
accommodation,
to
just
your
argument,
we
will
enlarge
your
time
three
minutes
so
that
you
can
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
plan
it
accordingly.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
be
sure,
i
got
your
one
statement
unclear
mr.
fishman.
well,
i
understand
you
to
say
that
a
grand
jury
could
call
an
assistant
through
a
senator
and
ask
where
he
got
a
particular
documents
as
a
foundation
to
determining
whether
they
were
stolen.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
the
fact
is
that
they
were
acquired
by
breaking
into
a
building
at
midnight
and
stolen
out
off
a
shelf
which
was
blown
up,
you
mean
they
can't
inquire
to
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
first
step
in
that
inquiry
might
be
to
ask
someone
who
has
possession,
where
did
you
get
them
and
then
go
to
that
source
and
to
the
one
before,
tracking
it
down
to
the
person
who
actually
broke
down
the
door
and
blew
up
the
safe?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
am
i
wrong,
if
there
was
three
pages
from
the
end
of
the
brief,
it's
in
the
footnote.
would
that
be
about
it
in
answer
to
this
colloquy
that
you
have
had
this
morning?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
is
up
now,
mr.

me
be
sure,
i
got
your
one
statement
unclear
mr.
fishman.
well,
i
understand
you
to
say
that
a
grand
jury
could
call
an
assistant
through
a
senator
and
ask
where
he
got
a
particular
documents
as
a
foundation
to
determining
whether
they
were
stolen.

well,
if
the
fact
is
that
they
were
acquired
by
breaking
into
a
building
at
midnight
and
stolen
out
off
a
shelf
which
was
blown
up,
you
mean
they
can't
inquire
to
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
first
step
in
that
inquiry
might
be
to
ask
someone
who
has
possession,
where
did
you
get
them
and
then
go
to
that
source
and
to
the
one
before,
tracking
it
down
to
the
person
who
actually
broke
down
the
door
and
blew
up
the
safe?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
am
i
wrong,
if
there
was
three
pages
from
the
end
of
the
brief,
it's
in
the
footnote.
would
that
be
about
it
in
answer
to
this
colloquy
that
you
have
had
this
morning?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
is
up
now,
mr.
fishman,
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
