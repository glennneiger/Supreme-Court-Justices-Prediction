suppose
somebody
steals
government
records,
breaks
property
in
order
to
get
it
and
bring
it
to
a
member
of
congress
and
tells
him
what
he
has
done,
and
the
member
of
congress
puts
him
on
his
staff,
is
he
outside?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
my
question
has
no
relation
to
present
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
senator
my
point
was
that
this
administrative
aide,
i
don't
want
to
rank
him
in
anyway,
without
the
consent
of
the
senate,
senator
or
congressman,
goes
out,
breaks
out
locks,
steals
property
and
brings
it
in.
one,
suppose
the
senator
said,
“look
he
shouldn't
have
done
that”
or
suppose
the
senator
said,
“fine,”
either
way,
is
that
aide
protected?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
it
your
position
that
it
makes
no
difference
whether
he
is
on
the
government
payroll
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
doesn't
matter
--
it
doesn't
matter
whether
he
is
a
employee
or
not,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
he
is
paid
or
not,
does
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
solicitor
general,
am
i
correct
that
you
wouldn't
be
able
to
question
the
senator
as
to
where
he
got
the
papers
from?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
this
was
related
you
agree
to
speech
and
debate?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
good
enough
for
me,
but
you
say
that
you
could
ask
the
secretary
where
you
got
them
from?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
your
position?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
think
we
misunderstood
each
other.
i
didn't
infer
any
criminal
action
at
all.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
didn't
infer
any
criminal
acts
at
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
kidnapping
is
criminal,
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
let
me
put
it
this
way.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
can
ask
a
senator
where
you
got
the
material
you
used
in
your
speech?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
can
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
you
can
ask
his
secretary?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
exact
same
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
do
you
say
about
senator
ervin's
point
that
when
that
section,
article
1,
section
6
was
adopted,
senators
and
congressmen
didn't
have
any
stenos
evidently?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
may
be
i
wasn't
fair
the
staff
were
not
as
elaborately
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
i
understood
is
argument,
you
couldn't
argue
that
they
were
deliberately
excluded?
justice
thurgood
marshall
take
this
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
senator
jones,
gets
up
on
the
floor
and
reads
a
top
secret
document
from
an
executive
office,
and
when
the
executive
office
checks
on
it,
they
find
the
safe
is
broken
into.
now
how
do
they
go
back
to
finding
out
how
the
senator
got
that
document?
justice
thurgood
marshall
of
whom
i
am
not
talking
what
i
am
talking
about
about
who?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
wait,
whom
would
you
question?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean,
under
normal
circumstances
you
have
asked
the
man
who
had
it,
how
did
he
get
it,
wouldn't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
you
can't
ask
the
senator
how

got
it?
justice
thurgood
