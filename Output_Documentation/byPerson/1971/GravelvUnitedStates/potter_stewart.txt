justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
don't
need
to
go
that
far
in
this
case
because
as
i
understand
it
at
least,
it
--
there's
no
question
but
what
--
he
was
an
aide
to
the
senator?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
don't
need
to
go
as
so
far
as
to
say
that
if
he
asks
the
president
of
a
big
corporation
how
should
i
vote
on
this
and
maybe
in
connection
with
the
advice
gets
$10000
along
with
it
that,
that's
under
the
speech
and
debate
clause.
you
don't
need
to
go
that
far
at
all.
there's
--
there's
no
issue
as
whether
or
not
he
was
an
aide
as
i
understand
it,
am
i
mistaken
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
that
the
case
involved
a
conspiracy,
about
to
give
and
accept
a
bribe,
didn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
of
bribery?
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
executive
privilege
which
unlikely
article
1,
section
6
is
only
to
be
--
is
only
to
be
found
in
the
implicit
provisions
of
the
constitution?
surely
that
protects
more
than
the
president,
the
vice-
president,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
as
to
what
the
aide
told
the
president
or
the
vice-president?
justice
potter
stewart
it
seems
to
me
that
your
argument
in
a
way
boils
down
to
the
proposition
that
a
privilege
that
is
explicitly
recognized
and
protected
by
the
constitution
is
narrower
privilege
than
one
that
is
not
such
as
executive
privilege?
justice
potter
stewart
back
to
what,
now
the
moment
there
was
a
charge
of
crime
with
respect
to
what?
justice
potter
stewart
well
that's
different,
but
how
about
just
a
charge
of
crime
against
john
smith,
the
president
of
smith
corporation
or
deal
confined
to
a
charge
of
crime
against
the
president
or
the
vice-president
or
the
aide
himself?
justice
potter
stewart
of
any
sort
by
any
one?
justice
potter
stewart
then
the
executive
privilege
vanishes?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
the
assertion
over
the
years
has
been
little
broader
than
that,
hasn't
it
of
executive
privilege?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
sourwine
wasn't
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
was
the
internal
security
committee
--
justice
potter
stewart
not
the
judiciary
committee?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
involved
a
constitutional
claim
i
mean
part
of
claims.
justice
potter
stewart
based
of
the
plaintiffs
--
a
person's
constitutional
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
so
of
course
to
the
powell
case?
justice
potter
stewart
tenney
against
brandhove
was
a
state
case,
wasn't
it?
it
came
from
state
legislation?
justice
potter
stewart
therefore
was
not
covered
by
the
speech
and
debate
clause
of
the
constitution.
what
do
you
suppose
the
constitutional
basis
to
that
decision
was?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
not
--
let
me
point
out
again
but
may
that
it
could
not
have
been
under
the
speech
and
debate
clause?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
no
(inaudible)
of
this
court's
business?
justice
potter
stewart
but,
certainly
congress
has
power
to
enact
evidentiary
rules
and
laws
for
the
federal
court
to
establish
privileges
or
to
abolish
common
law
privileges
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
as
long
as
they
are
not
constitutionally
based.
justice
potter
stewart
no
question
about
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
your
suggestion
is
that
it's
an
original
publication?
justice
potter
stewart
how
much,
if
any,
was
in
the
congressional
record?
justice
potter
stewart
comittee
reports
are
transcript
of
the
committee
hearings?
justice
potter
stewart
which
footnote,
what
page
you
are
on,
can
you
tell
me?
justice
potter
stewart
sure,
(inaudible)
let
your
colleague
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
that's
the
british
parliament,
the
parliamentary
premises
and
here
we
have
over
here,
we
have
constitution
of
the
united
states.
justice
potter
stewart
to
some
aspects,
but
i
don't
think
it
makes
that
case,
binding
on
us
either?
i
had
--
in
reading
your
brief,
a
long
brief
--
when
i
came
to
footnote
on
page
124,
i
thought
that
i
had
finally
got
your
submission
as
to
the
scope
of
what
you
are
asking
which
is
just
this.
senator
gravel
does
not
seek
to
protect
any
aspect
of
or
actor
in
the
pentagon
papers
case,
other
than
his
acquisition,
not
his
source's
acquisition
of
them.
his
staff's
preparation
of
the
papers
for
the
subcommittee
hearing
and
beacon
press'
preparation
of
the
papers
for
publication
and
it's
all
about
publication
and
distribution
of
them.
i
thought
finally,
i've
got
into
encapsulated
summary
of
what
this
brief
is
all
about?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
don't
need
to
go
that
far
in
this
case
because
as
i
understand
it
at
least,
it
--
there's
no
question
but
what
--
he
was
an
aide
to
the
senator?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
don't
need
to
go
as
so
far
as
to
say
that
if
he
asks
the
president
of
a
big
corporation
how
should
i
vote
on
this
and
maybe
in
connection
with
the
advice
gets
$10000
along
with
it
that,
that's
under
the
speech
and
debate
clause.
you
don't
need
to
go
that
far
at
all.
there's
--
there's
no
issue
as
whether
or
not
he
was
an
aide
as
i
understand
it,
am
i
mistaken
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
that
the
case
involved
a
conspiracy,
about
to
give
and
accept
a
bribe,
didn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
of
bribery?
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
executive
privilege
which
unlikely
article
1,
section
6
is
only
to
be
--
is
only
to
be
found
in
the
implicit
provisions
of
the
constitution?
surely
that
protects
more
than
the
president,
the
vice-
president,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
as
to
what
the
aide
told
the
president
or
the
vice-president?
justice
potter
stewart
it
seems
to
me
that
your
argument
in
a
way
boils
down
to
the
proposition
that
a
privilege
that
is
explicitly
recognized
and
protected
by
the

is
narrower

than
one
that
is
not
such
as
executive
privilege?
justice
potter
stewart
back
to
what,
now
the
moment
there
was
a
charge
of
crime
with
respect
to
what?
justice
potter
stewart
well
that's
different,
but
how
about
just
a
charge
of
crime
against
john
smith,
the
president
of
smith
corporation
or
deal
confined
to
a
charge
of
crime
against
the
president
or
the
vice-president
or
the
aide
himself?
justice
potter
stewart
of
any
sort
by
any
one?
justice
potter
stewart
then
the
executive
privilege
vanishes?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
the
assertion
over
the
years
has
been
little
broader
than
that,
hasn't
it
of
executive
privilege?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
sourwine
wasn't
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
was
the
internal
security
committee
--
justice
potter
stewart
not
the
judiciary
committee?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
involved
a
constitutional
claim
i
mean
part
of
claims.
justice
potter
stewart
based
of
the
plaintiffs
--
a
person's
constitutional
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
so
of
course
to
the
powell
case?
justice
potter
stewart
tenney
against
brandhove
was
a
state
case,
wasn't
it?
it
came
from
state
legislation?
justice
potter
stewart
therefore
was
not
covered
by
the
speech
and
debate
clause
of
the
constitution.
what
do
you
suppose
the
constitutional
basis
to
that
decision
was?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
not
--
let
me
point
out
again
but
may
that
it
could
not
have
been
under
the
speech
and
debate
clause?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
no
(inaudible)
of
this
court's
business?
justice
potter
stewart
but,
certainly
congress
has
power
to
enact
evidentiary
rules
and

for
the
federal

to
establish
privileges
or
to
abolish
common

privileges
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
as
long
as
they
are
not
constitutionally
based.
justice
potter
stewart
no
question
about
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
your
suggestion
is
that
it's
an
original
publication?
justice
potter
stewart
how
much,
if
any,
was
in
the
congressional
record?
justice
potter
stewart
comittee
reports
are
transcript
of
the
committee
hearings?
justice
potter
stewart
which
footnote,
what
page
you
are
on,
can
you
tell
me?
justice
potter
stewart
sure,
(inaudible)
let
your
colleague
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
that's
the
british
parliament,
the
parliamentary
premises
and
here
we
have
over
here,
we
have
constitution
of
the
united
states.
justice
potter
stewart
to
some
aspects,
but
i
don't
think
it
makes
that
case,
binding
on
us
either?
i
had
--
in
reading
your
brief,
a
long
brief
--
when
i
came
to
footnote
on
page
124,
i
thought
that
i
had
finally
got
your
submission
as
to
the
