justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
senator
you
said
short
of
publication,
is
that
saying
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
inquiry
or
discipline
or
both
is
something
exclusively
for
the
senate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
senator
the
congress,
both
houses
of
the
congress
enact
legislation,
which
authorizes
the
judicial
branch
to
make
an
inquiry,
is
that
statute
constitutional?
would
that
statute
be
constitutional?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
an
aide?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
senator
could
you
say
in
just
a
sentence
perhaps
what
is
the
senate's
position
on
the
republication
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no.[laughter]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
senator
may
that
not
be
in
this
very
case,
an
issue
of
source
of
the
pentagon
papers?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
about
the
aide?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
exclusively
with
the
senate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
guess
basically,
it
is
because
there
is
value
to
the
people
as
people
in
the
independence
of
legislators?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
can
phrase
it
in
separation
of
the
powers
in
other
terms,
but
that's
what's
at
the
bottom,
what
it
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
isn't
there
an
issue
of
the
source,
either
the
aide
or
the
senator?
where
did
that
come
from?
isn't
that
issue
in
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
it
is,
and
the
inquiry
goes
to
that
they
were
improperly
obtained
before
the
aide
joined
the
senator's
subcommittee?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
right,
before.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
there
be
any
doubt
in
your
mind
that
that
inquiry
could
go
forward?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though
the
papers
are
related
to
or
their
use
at
least,
related
to
the
legislative
function?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather,
you
don't
question
either
mr.
reinstein,
that
if
we
had
an
act
which
related
--
which
was
not
legislative
because
it
was
in
the
approach
side
of
the
executive
department,
someone
in
the
executive
department,
you
don't
say
that
that
comes
within
the
cover
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
--
from
where
--
what
do
they
derive
from
mr.
solicitor
general,
whether
--
what
--
from
what
did
those
limitations
derive?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
solicitor
general
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
gather
it's
not
doubted
that
the
purpose
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause
was
not
protect
senators
or
congressmen,
that
its
purpose
was
to
assure
the
people
of
the
independence
and
integrity
of
their
legislators,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
know,
but
that's
the
purpose,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
put
it
this
way,
certainly
our
cases,
our
opinions
in
this
area
have
said,
have
they
not,
most
recently
johnson,
that
the
purpose
of
the
clause
was
not
protection
of
the
congressman
or
senators,
but
was
as
i
have
indicated
to
guarantee
the
people
the
independence
and
integrity
of
their
legislator?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
we
have
said.
now
accepting
that
for
a
moment,
in
the
present
context
of
the
operation
of
the
congress,
it's
impossible
i
gather
even
the
executive
branch
would
agree
i
am
sure,
to
carry
on
its
function
without
the
assistance
of
aides,
isn't
it?
can
you
imagine
a
senator
today
by
himself
performing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
know
what
i
want
--
what
i
am
trying
to
get
to
if
you
accept
the
premise
of
the
purpose
of
the
clause
as
i
have
stated
it,
then
if
the
aides
don't
have
the
benefit
of
it
as
i
think
was
argued
yesterday,
the
clause
becomes
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
suggest
that
to
the
extent
that
we
have
put
that
emphasis
on
the
purpose
of
the
clause
to
use
your
word,
it
has
already
been
ignored.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
accept
the
real
hazard
is
that
their
independence
and
integrity
or
at
least
their
independence,
if
you
are
right
and
that
aides
are
not
also
protected,
his
close
aides,
the
hazard
is
that
the
pressures
of
the
executive
department
can
deny
the
people
the
independence
or
offers
a
hazard
of
denying
the
independence
which
was
the
purpose
of
the
protection?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
thought
you
suggest
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
suggested
earlier,
didn't
you
mr.
solicitor
general
that
there
was
some
kind
of
common
law
privilege,
very-very
narrow
one
and
that
you
sought
even
the
aides
might
today.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
suppose
if
there
is
then
the
congress
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
much
of
the
exhibits
published?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
much
has
been
published?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
the
40
what
the
40
odd
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
43
have
actually
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
gather
mr.
fishman
the
limitation
against
inquiring
the
motives
and
purposes,
you
feel
--
was
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
for
--
you
want
a
broader
protection
than
that,
don't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
facts
--
didn't
take
court
of
appeals
in
the
protective
order,
limit
inquiry
of
dr.
rodberg
or
the
the
other
witnesses,
and
to
anything
that
is
more
on
motives
or
purposes?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
satisfied
with
the
limitations?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
what
i
am
thinking?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean,
you
don't
understand
what
the
motives
and
purposes
are?
are
there
other
things
you
don't
understand
about
it?
