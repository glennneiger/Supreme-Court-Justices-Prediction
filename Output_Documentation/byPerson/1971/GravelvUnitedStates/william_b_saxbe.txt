mr.
william
b.
saxbe
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
please
the
court.
i
want
to
join
with
senator
ervin
in
thanking
this
court
for
allowing
us
to
orally
argue
this
case,
representing
the
senate
as
amicus.
i
think
it
is
particularly
important
to
note
that
this
is
the
first
time
the
senate
has,
as
a
body
appeared
before
this
court.
the
gravity
of
this
case
and
the
potential
impact
of
your
decision
on
the
doctrine
of
separation
and
power
that
brings
the
importance
of
this
case
and
the
senate
to
you
today.
the
senate
brief
is
not
an
ordinary
amicus
brief
i
might
add.
it
is
a
statement
of
the
senate
understanding,
the
meaning
of
the
constitution.
we
respectfully
hope
that
our
statement
will
aid
to
court
in
the
determination
of
this
case
which
carries
this
great
weight
in
regard
to
the
legislative
branch
and
its
ability
to
serve
the
people
that
it
represents.
our
brief
is
filed
on
the
half
of
congressional
privilege.
it
is
not
a
defense
of
senate
gravel
or
his
aide
and
specifically
not
a
defense
of
their
conduct
which
established
the
fact
pattern
of
this
litigation.
many
senators,
including
myself,
feel
that
the
junior
senator
from
alaska
deeply
abused
the
rules
of
the
senate.
we
feel
strongly
that
his
actions,
while
possibly
adhering
to
the
letter
of
the
rules
certainly
violated
the
spirit
of
it.
senator
gravel's
actions
were
reprehensible.
i
am
in
agreement
with
every
senator
who
thinks
that
he
did
an
outrageous
thing,
but
i
believe
it
is
for
the
senate
to
decide
whether
he
be
punished
and
to
inquire
as
to
the
conduct
would
necessitate
punishment.
if
the
senate
(inaudible)
demurrer
the
executive
still
could
not
use
the
subpoena
and
contempt
power
of
the
judiciary
to
punish
him
because
of
the
congressional
privilege
we
believe
that's
provided
by
the
constitution.
any
punishment
or
a
sanction
is
for
the
senate
and
the
senate
alone
to
meet
out.
a
grand
jury
inquiry
is
barred
under
article
1,
section
6
of
the
united
states
constitution
commonly
known
as
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
its
purpose
and
historical
use
is
not
to
reward
members
of
legislative
branch
with
immunity
but
to
allow
them
to
perform
their
duties
and
obligations
of
elective
officers.
each
member
of
congress
must
decide
for
himself
which
issues
require
ventilation
and
how
can
best
inform
is
constituency.
it's
not
for
the
executive
to
challenge,
or
for
the

of
issues,
to
publicize
or
other
methods
of

to
his
constituency
regardless
of
whether
they
may
be
considered
ill-advised.
the
senate
acts
as
a
whole
or
in
part
may
not
prove
the
exercise
of
privilege
by
senator
gravel
in
this
case.
and
i
am
here
to
represent
that
part
of
the
senate
which
vehemently
disagree
with
his
actions
but
join
him
in
the
assertion
of
the
congressional
privilege.
the
executive
or
judiciary
branch
cannot
dictate
the
bounds
of
congressional
privilege
if
we
are
to
retain
meaningful
separation
of
powers,
whether
its
necessarily
board
in
concept
of
congressional
immunity.
the
constitution
provides
the
members
of
congress,
may
not
be
questioned
in
any
other
place,
or
any
speech
or
debate
or
any
action
surrounding
a
legislative
and
informing

the
constitution
does
not
allow
the
executive
to
second
guess
a
member
of
congress
as
to
what
his
legislative
duties
are
even
if
the
judiciary
agrees
by
testing
his
congressional
privilege
by
grand
jury
inquiry.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
if
the
senate
and
he
is
referring
to
a
senator,
he
is
employed
by
him?
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
if
the
senator
said
yes,
this
man
--
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
i
don't
think
it
can
be
extended
in
that
manner
in
any
way.
it
can
only
be
extended
by
the
senator
or
by
the
body
itself.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
i
don't
--
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
i
don't
think
that
you
can
extended
beyond
the
first
degree
at
that
point.
i
don't
think
that
it
could
be
extended
to
a
wiretapping.
i
have
searched
my
mind
on
this,
a
very
difficult
position.
suppose
its
june
of
1944
and
a
senator
discloses
to
the
enemy
the
d-day
landing
dates
in
france.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
i
think
that,
that
with
follow
if
it
was
in
performance
of
what
he
felt
to
be
his
constitutional
duty.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
but,
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
i
would
say
that
he
would
be
immune
if
he
could
successfully
tired
in
to
his
legislative
duties.
now,
he
can
be
arrested
for
running
through
the
traffic
light
out
here
in
front.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
absolutely,
just
as
running
through
this
traffic
light
out
here.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
that
would
be
a
difficult
thing
to
determine,
but
the
senate
and
the
congress
itself
--
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
i
can
foresee
that
there
would
be
certain
circumstances,
primarily
in
criminal
law
where
the
senate
would
have
to
deliver
up
one
of
there
member
and
aides
because
he
so
stepped
outside
the
scope
of
any
reasonable
senate
activity
that
he
would
have
to
be
prosecuted.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
i
don't
think
that
they
can
get
to
the
source
of
the
pentagon
papers
through
senator
gravel.
now
this
is
the
nub
of
--
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
i
don't
think
that
you
can
strip
the
aide
of
senator
gravel's
immunity
in
this
particular
instance.
now,
as
to
the
senate's
responsibility
in
following
through
on
this,
yes,
i
feel
that
there
is
a
responsibility.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
but
exclusively
with
the
senate
and
with
the
senator's
aide
in
this
particular
instance.
now,
i
can
foresee
criminal
acts,
as
justice
white
has
raised,
where
the
senate
would
have
to
deliver
up
one
of
their
members
to
the
regular
procedures
of
the
courts.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
he
is
not
covered
by
the
immunity
and
he
might
appeal
by
saying,
this
is
something
that
i
need
in
my
committee.
i'm
breaking
into
this
room,
to
get
this
and
then
of
course,
if
the
senate
rushed
to
his
defense
and
said
this
is
a
very
thing
that
we
have
a
great
need
for
and
it's
important,
i
can
see
a
weakness
in
the
case,
but
i
don't
think
that
particular
thing
would
happen.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
and
the
members
of
congress
do
have
the
responsibility
of
living
up
to
keeping
their
own
house
in
order
and
i
hope
that
they
will
do
a
proper
job
thereby.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
i
think
that
the
present
case
is,
i
can
see
the
--
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
well,
i
think
in
the
particular
instance,
that
he
has
to
be
employed
at
the
time
and
i
was
going
to
say
that
in
the
present
case,
the
question
has
arisen
in
our
minds
as
to
whether
there
was
an
attempt
to
close
dr.
rodberg
with
this
immunity
after
the
fact
and
i
think
that
there
is
something
that
the
senate
could
well
look
into.
but
in
this
man
through
his
stealing
and
takes
him
and
then
there
is
an
attempt
to
cloth
him,
i
think
it
would
fall
by
it's
own
weight.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
he
is
not
protected
for
the
acts
that
were
performed
prior
to
being
clothed
by
this
and
i
would
think
that
senator
would
have
a
responsibility.
if
he
knew
that
he
violated
the
law,
to
immediately
notify
the
proper
authority.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
i
think
that
this
is
a
worst
type
of
situation
that
i
could
imagine,
or
a
man
would
disclose
information
that
would
compromise
the
armed
forces
and
they
actually
feature
this
character.
i
think
even
in
that
case,
it
would
fall
upon
the
senate
to
punish
and
to
move
against
this
senator
who
has
violated
his
trust.
i
think
that
in
the
worst
instance
of
this
nature
where
he
took
his
advantage
to
classified
documents
and
disclose
them,
that
he
still
would
be
subject
to
the
punishment
of
the
senate
of
the
united
states
or
the
house
of
representatives
as
the
case
maybe.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
and
only
--
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
yes
and
one
that
has
been
carefully
avoided
i
might
add.
[laughter]
the
classified
nature
of
the
information
is
not
the
real
issue
of
this
case.
i
don't
think.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
mr.

may
i
please

mr.
william
b.
saxbe
he
is
not
protected
for
the
acts
that
were
performed
prior
to
being
clothed
by
this
and
i
would
think
that
senator
would
have
a
responsibility.
if
he
knew
that
he
violated
the
law,
to
immediately
notify
the
proper
authority.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
i
think
that
this
is
a
worst
type
of
situation
that
i
could
imagine,
or
a
man
would
disclose
information
that
would
compromise
the
armed
forces
and
they
actually
feature
this
character.
i
think
even
in
that
case,
it
would
fall
upon
the
senate
to
punish
and
to
move
against
this
senator
who
has
violated
his
trust.
i
think
that
in
the
worst
instance
of
this
nature
where
he
took
his
advantage
to
classified
documents
and
disclose
them,
that
he
still
would
be
subject
to
the
punishment
of
the
senate
of
the
united
states
or
the
house
of
representatives
as
the
case
maybe.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
and
only
--
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
yes
and
one
that
has
been
carefully
avoided
i
might
add.
[laughter]
the
classified
nature
of
the
information
is
not
the
real
issue
of
this
case.
i
don't
think.
