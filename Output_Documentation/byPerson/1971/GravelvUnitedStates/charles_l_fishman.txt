mr.
charles
l.
fishman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
go
right
to
the
heart
of
the
claim
of
the
solicitor
general.
as
i
understand
that
is
that
the
assertion
of
a
possible
illegal
act
raised
to
the
justice
department,
the
power
to
imply
into
a
legislative
proceeding,
that
as
i
understand
that
it
is
our
view.
effects
of
that
--
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
it
doesn't
seem
to
make
a
difference
whether
it's
a
committee
hearing,
a
debate
on
the
floor,
or
an
attempt
by
a
member
to
inform
its
constituents.
he
made
no
distinctions
as
i
understand
it,
but
specifically
here
we
are
talking
about
a
committee
meeting
and
a
publication
of
the
committee
transcript.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
by
senator
gravel,
and
but
i
am
leaving
this
--
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
that's
not
true,
your
honor.
that
is
not
true.
i
invite
your
honor
to
the
record
where
in
the
district
court
that
assertion
was
made
on
the
basis
of
a
newspaper
article.
district
judge
garrity
denied
the
use
of
that
article
for
the
purpose
which
the
government
tried
to
use
it.
the
only
purpose
was
an
assertion
in
that
article,
that
senator
randolph
was
upset
with
senator
gravel
and
refused
to
pay
for
transcript.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
well,
two
things
sir.
in
the
discussion
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
with
respect
to
that
matter,
senator
randolph
and
senator
dole
both
conceded
that,
that
was
not
a
problem
in
the
subcommittee,
and
indeed
as
your
honor
knows,
most
committee
reports
are
not
printed
in
the
united
states
covers.
it's
the
rare
report
that
actually
ends
up
being
printed.
the
appropriations
committee
meetings
almost
never,
never
published
ultimately
by
the
gpo.
so
really
what
we
have
here
is
nothing
different
in
which
you
have
normally
and
customarily
before
either
house
of
the
congress,
which
is
a
committee
transcript
was
compiled.
it
was
not
printed
officially
in
the
sense
of
the
government
printing
office
printing
it,
but
it
was
printed
rather
by
beacon
press.
now
as
we
have
shown
in
our
brief,
a
three-page
footnote,
that
kind
of
publication
is
normally
and
customarily
done
with
respect
to
committee
reports
of
the
united
states
congress.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
yes,
sir,
both
are
involved
there
as
--
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
you
just
give
me
one
moment,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
fine.
but
it's
a
rather
extensive
footnote
and
i
might
add
that
we
were
limited
of
the
time
in
which
we
had
to
do
it.
that
was
what
we
got
out
of
the
library
of
congress
called
a
catalog.
there
were
we
found
out,
after
the
brief
had
to
be
submitted,
it's
footnote
119
which
states
on
page
86.
it
also
covers
page
86,
that
goes
on
and
on.
i
might
add
that
since
then
mr.
chief
justice,
we
have
discovered
that
every
available
congressional
report
is
on
microfilm
in
a
variety
of
both
private
and
public
sources.
and
anyone
who
wishes,
can
purchase
any
single
report
or
an
entire
proceedings
of
every
single
congress
from
the
first
congress
through
the
last
congress,
either
partly
or
to
some
extent
through
the
library
of
congress.
so
it
seems
really
clear
from
the
history
of
what
has
happened
in
this
nation
that
the
fact
that
senator
gravel
went
to
beacon
press
as
opposed
to
government
printing
office
makes
their
difference.
indeed
the
solicitor
general
does
not
argue
than
it
does,
either
in
its
brief
or
here
today.
his
position
i
assume
is
that
had
senator
gravel
gone
to
gpo
and
his
subcommittee
chairman
said
please
publish
this
report
and
the
gpo
did
publish
the
report,
that
nonetheless
the
grand
jury
could
still
conduct
the
same
inquiry.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
well,
again
your
honor,
the
district
court
made
a
finding
of
fact.
that
finding
was
that
the
purpose
of
the
subpoena
to
dr.
rodberg
was
to
question
dr.
rodberg
with
respect
to
preparation
in
the
conduct
of
the
subcommittee
meeting.
that
finding
of
fact
was
not
appealed
your
honor
and
is
not
before
this
court.
in
the
district
court,
when
the
question
came
up
with
respect
to
the
subpoena
of
mr.
webber,
which
is
the
other
party
that
was
actually
--
the
subpoena
is
before
this
court.
at
page
128
of
the
appendix,
the
government
asserted
that
the
primary
purpose
for
calling
mr.
webber
was,
if
may
quote,
“i
must
in
fairness
conceive
that
other
areas
of
interest
to
us
are
ancillary
so
to
speak
or
originated
from
the
contact
made
by
the
senator's
representatives.”
the
basic
purpose
that
they
wished
to
question
dr.
webber
as
they
stated
in
the
district
court
was
about
the
conversations
that
dr.
webber
had
with
senator
gravel
and
with
his
aides
with
respect
to
the
publication
of
the
subcommittee
transcript.
it
was
not
with
respect
to
acquisitions.
those
were
the
findings
of
the
district
court.
so
i
don't
think
that
the
government
at
this
late
date
can
come
to
this
court
and
say
really
we
are
only
interested
in
the
original
theft
of
the
documents.
that
question
has
been
now
been
foreclosed.but
even
if
it
were
--
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
thank
you,
sir.
i
appreciate
that.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
i
appreciate
that.
but
even
if
it
were,
your
honor,
we
have
never
claimed
that
the
privilege
applies
to
anything
other
than
legislative
acts,
never.
senator
gravel
is
subject
to
subpoena,
as
is
dr.
rodberg,
as
is
dr.
webber,
as
anyone
else,
with
respect
to
non-legislative
acts.
the
stealing
of
the
papers
we
say
is
a
non-legislative
act
and
we
have
no
objection,
the
senator
has
no
objection,
to
appearing
before
that
grand
jury
and
testifying
with
respect
to
his
knowledge
which
he
has
none
incidentally,
about
the
stealing
of
those
papers.
what
we
maintain
and
we
have
maintained
throughout
this
entire
proceeding,
what
the
basis
of
the
dispute
has
been,
is
to
the
extent
to
which
the
executive
may
come
to
this
court
and
seek
its
subpoena
and
contempt
powers
to
inquire
into
legislative
acts,
and
there
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
suggested,
we
have
asserted
a
testimonial
privilege
to
prohibit
inquiry
of
legislative
acts,
but
only
legislative
acts.
all
of
the
examples
of
the
solicitor
general
did
not
involve
legislative
acts,
certainly
kidnapping
is
not
a
legislative
act
and
we
would
have
no
objection
to
inquiry
involving
non-legislative
acts.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
that's
where
receipt
would
be
prohibited
your
honor,
inquiring
to
receipt
would
be
prohibited.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
i'm
not
sure
if
i
follow
--
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
that's
right,
but
there
was
beyond
that.
they
limited
the
questioning
of
dr.
rodberg
beyond
that
your
honor.
what
they
failed
to
do
was
to
extend
the
prohibition
against
inquiry
to
those
who
assisted
senator
gravel.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
no
your
honor.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
no,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
sort
of
false
sir,
because
no
one
can
understand
it,
that's
what
the
basic
part
of
it
is.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
well,
that's
one
of
the
problems
certainly.
i
would
like
to,
in
that
vein
go
to
another
problem
that
keeps
on
popping
up
if
i
may
which
is
we
have
never
asserted
an
immunity
from
accountability
although
the
solicitor
general
keeps
on
bringing
us
back
to
that.
i
can't
emphasize
enough
that
our
position
is
that
if
a
crime
has
been
committed,
those
who
committed
them
are
accountable.
it's
merely
a
question
of
where
the
accountability
occurs.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
in
court?
if
dr.
rodberg,
and
i
am
using
as
an
example,
committed
a
crime
and
it
was
a
non-legislative
act,
there
would
be
no
problem.
he
could
be
tried
and
convicted
in
de
novo
process.
if
there
was
some
question
--
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
well,
than
this
court
would
have
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
follow
the
--
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
well,
it's
really
a
case
of
the
alternate
first
impression
in
this
line
i
suppose.
we
have
(inaudible)
your
honor
and
it's
our
position
as
we
came
to
it
that
this
court
should
follow
the
english
line
of
west
and
walter
and
hold
that
those
who
assist,
whose
assistance
is
absolutely
necessary
could
not
be
held
accountable
but
of
course
this
court
could
hold
it
the
other
way.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
well,
it's
that
part
of
the
problem
of
the
cases
your
honor
that
they
arose
based
on
the
libel
and
slander
cases
which
are
criminal
in
england,
and
it's
a
lot
easy
to
say
that
that's
protected,
then
it
would
be,
say
stealing.
certainly,
stealing,
the
answer
is
no.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
no,
i
think
that
this
court
ultimately
has
to
determine
the
scope
of
clause.
we
have
never
maintained
that
senator
gravel
himself
can
determine
the
scope
of
the
clause.
this
court
has
to
determine
the
--
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
well,
i
think
comity
requires
that
this
court
give
a
good
deal
of
consideration
to
the
position
of
a
member
or
indeed
the
body
in
that
situation,
but
ultimately
i
think
this
court
has
the
responsibility
of
drawing
the
line.
ultimately,
it
must
fall
to
this
court.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
no,
your
honor.
i
said
the
acquisition,
as
we
have
to
draw
the
line
simply
because
when
you
are
going
to
acquisition,
you
have
to
go
into
things
like
his
intent.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
no,
they
certainly
can,
your
honor.
i
may
have
misunderstood
you,
your
honor.
what
i
was
suggesting
was
that
at
the
point
when
the
material
reaches
the
legislative
body,
acquisition
for
the
legislative
body,
once
it
brings
it
to
its
(inaudible),
the
inquiry
must
stop,
but
anything
that
occurred
prior
to
that
time,
certainly,
the
grand
jury
may
inquiry
into.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
so
as
long
as
that
is
not
of
the
senator
or
of
the
aide
or
of
anyone
who
assisted
him
in
the
legislative
process,
i
see
no
problem
with
that.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
if
i
may
your
honor.
excuse
me.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
they
could
inquire.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
they
can
inquire,
i
suppose,
of
anyone
and
any
who
was
involved
at
any
point,
up
to
the
point
were
that
material
was
received
by
the
senator
or
his
aide.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
well,
it
depends
on
its
fact
situation.
i
mean
there
are
situation,
i
suppose,
which
one
person
just
tucked
it
under
his
arm
and
walked
away.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
certainly.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
i
don't
believe
you
could
ask
the
aide
where
he
got
it
either.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
no,
that
situation
arose
in
1938
in
england,
as
your
honor
may
know
in
sandys
case,
in
which
a
member
of
the
british
parliament
received
battle
of
the
order
plans.
we
are
not
talking
about
historical
too
but
battle
of
order
plans,
the
defense
of
britain,
the
defense
of
the
air,
in
the
aircraft
defense
and
the
english
parliament
held
that
mr.
sands
(ph)
was
not
inquirable
in
any
other
place
other
than
the
house
of
parliament.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
to
the
some
extent,
that
makes
our
argument
stronger,
i
believe.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
i
am
sorry
it
took
so
long
to
get
there,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
yes,
and
without
question
that
is
our
position.
we
don't
think
we
have
to
go
beyond
it,
and
we
don't
wish
to
go
on
it.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
prior
to
what,
sir?
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
independently
of
the
senator's
office,
the
answer
would
be
yes.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
i
think
that
would
be
perfectly
inquirable.
we
have
no
objection
to
dr.
rodberg
asking
that
question,
there
would
be
no
privilege
asserted
there.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
well,
did
you
know
prior
to
the
actual
acquisition,
that
the
senator
was
going
to
acquire
them,
i
suspect
that
would
be
barred.
that's
where
you
touched
on
the
legislative
process,
that's
where
you
crossed
that
very
difficult
line,
and
you
started
into
a
sphere
of
legislative
activity.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
go
right
to
the
heart
of
the
claim
of
the
solicitor
general.
as
i

that
is
that
the

of

the
justice
department,
the
power
to

that
as
i
understand
that
it
is
our

effects
of
that
--
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
it
doesn't
seem
to
make
a
difference
whether
it's
a
committee
hearing,
a
debate
on
the
floor,
or
an
attempt
by
a
member
to
inform
its
constituents.
he
made
no
distinctions
as
i
understand
it,
but
specifically
here
we
are
talking
about
a
committee
meeting
and
a
publication
of
the
committee
transcript.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
by
senator
gravel,
and
but
i
am
leaving
this
--
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
that's
not
true,
your
honor.
that
is
not
true.
i
invite
your
honor
to
the
record
where
in
the
district

that

was
made
on

entire
proceedings
of
every
single
congress
from
the
first
congress
through
the
last
congress,
either
partly
or
to
some
extent
through
the
library
of
congress.
so
it
seems
really
clear
from
the
history
of
what
has
happened
in
this
nation
that
the
fact
that
senator
gravel
went
to
beacon
press
as
opposed
to
government
printing
office
makes
their
difference.
indeed
the
solicitor
general
does
not
argue
than
it
does,
either
in
its
brief
or
here
today.
his
position
i
assume
is
that
had
senator
gravel
gone
to
gpo
and
his
subcommittee
chairman
said
please
publish
this
report
and
the
gpo
did
publish
the
report,
that
nonetheless
the
grand
jury
could
still
conduct
the
same
inquiry.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
well,
again
your
honor,
the
district
court
made
a
finding
of
fact.
that
finding
was
that
the
purpose
of
the
subpoena
to
dr.
rodberg
was
to
question
dr.
rodberg
with
respect
to
preparation
in
the
conduct
of
the
subcommittee
meeting.
that
finding
of
fact
was
not
appealed
your
honor
and
is
not
before
this
court.
in
the
district
court,
when
the
question
came
up
with
respect
to
the
subpoena
of
mr.
webber,
which
is
the
other
party
that
was
actually
--
the
subpoena
is
before
this
court.
at
page
128
of
the
appendix,
the
government
asserted
that
the
primary
purpose
for
calling
mr.
webber
was,
if
may
quote,
“i
must
in
fairness
conceive
that
other
areas
of
interest
to
us
are
ancillary
so
to
speak
or
originated
from
the
contact
made
by
the
senator's
representatives.”
the
basic
purpose
that
they
wished
to
question
dr.
webber
as
they
stated
in
the
district
court
was
about
the
conversations
that
dr.
webber
had
with
senator
gravel
and
with
his
aides
with
respect
to
the
publication
of
the
subcommittee
transcript.
it
was
not
with
respect
to
acquisitions.
those
were
the
findings
of
the
district
court.
so
i
don't
think
that
the
government
at
this
late
date
can
come
to
this
court
and
say
really
we
are
only
interested
in
the
original
theft
of
the
documents.
that
question
has
been
now
been
foreclosed.but
even
if
it
were
--
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
thank
you,
sir.
i
appreciate
that.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
i
appreciate
that.
but
even
if
it
were,
your
honor,
we
have
never
claimed
that
the
privilege
applies
to
anything
other
than
legislative
acts,
never.
senator
gravel
is
subject
to
subpoena,
as
is
dr.
rodberg,
as
is
dr.
webber,
as
anyone
else,
with
respect
to
non-legislative
acts.
the
stealing
of
the
papers
we
say
is
a
non-legislative
act
and
we
have
no
objection,
the
senator
has
no
objection,
to
appearing
before
that
grand
jury
and
testifying
with
respect
to
his
knowledge
which
he
has
none
incidentally,
about
the
stealing
of
those
papers.
what
we
maintain
and
we
have
maintained
throughout
this
entire
proceeding,
what
the
basis
of
the
dispute
has
been,
is
to
the
extent
to
which
the
executive
may
come
to
this
court
and
seek
its
subpoena
and
contempt
powers
to
inquire
into
legislative
acts,
and
there
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
suggested,
we
have
asserted
a
testimonial
privilege
to
prohibit
inquiry
of
legislative
acts,
but
only
legislative
acts.
all
of
the
examples
of
the
solicitor
general
did
not
involve
legislative
acts,
certainly
kidnapping
is
not
a
legislative
act
and
we
would
have
no
objection
to
inquiry
involving
non-legislative
acts.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
that's
where
receipt
would
be
prohibited
your
honor,
inquiring
to
receipt
would
be
prohibited.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
i'm
not
sure
if
i
follow
--
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
that's
right,
but
there
was
beyond
that.
they
limited
the
questioning
of
dr.
rodberg
beyond
that
your
honor.
what
they
failed
to
do
was
to
extend
the
prohibition
against
inquiry
to
those
who
assisted
senator
gravel.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
no
your
honor.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
no,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
sort
of
false
sir,
because
no
one
can
understand
it,
that's
what
the
basic
part
of
it
is.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
well,
that's
one
of
the
problems
certainly.
i
would
like
to,
in
that
vein
go
to
another
problem
that
keeps
on
popping
up
if
i
may
which
is
we
have
never
asserted
an
immunity
from
accountability
although
the
solicitor
general
keeps
on
bringing
us
back
to
that.
i
can't
emphasize
enough
that
our
position
is
that
if
a
crime
has
been
committed,
those
who
committed
them
are
accountable.
it's
merely
a
question
of
where
the
accountability
occurs.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
in
court?
if
dr.
rodberg,
and
i
am
using
as
an
example,
committed
a
crime
and
it
was
a
non-legislative
act,
there
would
be
no
problem.
he
could
be
tried
and
convicted
in
de
novo
process.
if
there
was
some
question
--
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
well,
than
this
court
would
have
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
follow
the
--
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
well,
it's
really
a
case
of
the
alternate
first
impression
in
this
line
i
suppose.
we
have
(inaudible)
your
honor
and
it's
our
position
as
we
came
to
it
that
this
court
should
follow
the
english
line
of
west
and
walter
and
hold
that
those
who
assist,
whose
assistance
is
absolutely
necessary
could
not
be
held
accountable
but
of
course
this
court
could
hold
it
the
other
way.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
well,
it's
that
part
of
the
problem
of
the
cases
your
honor
that
they
arose
based
on
the
libel
and
slander
cases
which
are
criminal
in
england,
and
it's
a
lot
easy
to
say
that
that's
protected,
then
it
would
be,
say
stealing.
certainly,
stealing,
the
answer
is
no.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
no,
i
think
that
this
court
ultimately
has
to
determine
the
scope
of
clause.
we
have
never
maintained
that
senator
gravel
himself
can
determine
the
scope
of
the
clause.
this
court
has
to
determine
the
--
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
well,
i
think
comity
requires
that
this
court
give
a
good
deal
of
consideration
to
the
position
of
a
member
or
indeed
the
body
in
that
situation,
but
ultimately
i
think
this
court
has
the
responsibility
of
drawing
the
line.
ultimately,
it
must
fall
to
this
court.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
no,
your
honor.
i
said
the
acquisition,
as
we
have
to
draw
the
line
simply
because
when
you
are
going
to
acquisition,
you
have
to
go
into
things
like
his
intent.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
no,
they
certainly
can,
your
honor.
i
may
have
misunderstood
you,
your
honor.
what
i
was
suggesting
was
that
at
the
point
when
the
material
reaches
the
legislative
body,
acquisition
for
the
legislative
body,
once
it
brings
it
to
its
(inaudible),
the
inquiry
must
stop,
but
anything
that
occurred
prior
to
that
time,
certainly,
the
grand
jury
may
inquiry
into.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
so
as
long
as
that
is
not
of
the
senator
or
of
the
aide
or
of
anyone
who
assisted
him
in
the
legislative
process,
i
see
no
problem
with
that.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
if
i
may
your
honor.
excuse
me.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
they
could
inquire.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
they
can
inquire,
i
suppose,
of
anyone
and
any
who
was
involved
at
any
point,
up
to
the
point
were
that
material
was
received
by
the
senator
or
his
aide.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
well,
it
depends
on
its
fact
situation.
i
mean
there
are
situation,
i
suppose,
which
one
person
just
tucked
it
under
his
arm
and
walked
away.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
certainly.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
i
don't
believe
you
could
ask
the
aide
where
he
got
it
either.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
no,
that
situation
arose
in
1938
in
england,
as
your
honor
may
know
in
sandys
case,
in
which
a
member
of
the
british
parliament
received
battle
of
the
order
plans.
we
are
not
talking
about
historical
too
but
battle
of
order
plans,
the
defense
of
britain,
the
defense
of
the
air,
in
the
aircraft
defense
and
the
english
parliament
held
that
mr.
sands
(ph)
was
not
inquirable
in
any
other
place
other
than
the
house
of
parliament.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
to
the
some
extent,
that
makes
our
argument
stronger,
i
believe.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
i
am
sorry
it
took
so
long
to
get
there,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
yes,
and
without
question
that
is
our
position.
we
don't
think
we
have
to
go
beyond
it,
and
we
don't
wish
to
go
on
it.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
prior
to
what,
sir?
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
independently
of
the
senator's
office,
the
answer
would
be
yes.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
i
think
that
would
be
perfectly
inquirable.
we
have
no
objection
to
dr.
rodberg
asking
that
question,
there
would
be
no
privilege
asserted
there.
mr.
charles
l.
fishman
well,
did
you
know
prior
to
the
actual
acquisition,
that
the
senator
was
going
to
acquire
them,
i
suspect
that
would
be
barred.
that's
where
you
touched
on
the
legislative
process,
that's
where
you
crossed
that
very
difficult
line,
and
you
started
into
a
sphere
of
legislative
activity.
