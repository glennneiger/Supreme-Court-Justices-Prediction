justice
byron
r.
white
senator,
if
the
government
indicts
someone
for
wiretapping
and
indicts
two
people
for
wiretapping,
and
one
of
them
is
given
immunity
and
he
testifies
that
he
was
hired
for
the
wiretap
by
a
senator
in
order
to
aid
the
senator
in
his
legislative
duties
to
get
information
to
conduct
a
hearing,
would
you
think
his
co-defendant
may
be
convicted
or
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
senator
doesn't
say
anything,
there
are
just
two
men
who
have
been
hired
and
one
of
them
says
we
were
hired
by
a
senator
to
tap
a
wire,
not
(inaudible)
of
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright
and
if
the,
if
the
testimony
is
that
they
were
hired
by
the
aide
to
the
senator,
could
the
aide
be
convicted
for
wiretapping
--
justice
byron
r.
white
or
for
the
conspiracy
to
wiretapping?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
take
it
that
senate's
position
is
though
is
that
the
senator
could
not
convicted
for
a
wiretapping?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
no
body
questions
about
what
he
desired
to
have
information,
that
was
very
relevant
to
his
legislative
duties
and
he
was
quite
willing
to
break
--
to
not
comply
with
wiretap
law
in
securing
information?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
that
he
was
immune
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose,
if
they
got
to
senator
in
his
aide
and
the
third
party
in
the
act
of
breaking
in
a
building
somewhere,
they
could
arrest
all
of
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
the
information
that
he
were
going
to
get
on
to
the
file
somewhere
or
was
going
to,
it's
going
to
be
introduced
in
on
committee
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
an
aide
and
the
senator
and
a
third
party
had
thought
seizing
a
--
caught
in
the
act
--
one
of
them
caught
in
the
act
of
breaking
into
the
building,
the
only
thing
is
the
other
one
has
already
gone
with
the
guts
and
that
gets
back
to
the
senator
and
he
introduces
it
into
a
legislative
hearing.
so,
there
is
no
question
that
the
material
that
was
stolen
is
used
in
a
legislative
hearing,
it
is
no
question
about
it
and
it
also
relevant
to
the
subject
matter
of
the
committee.
may
be
aide
be
convicted
or
the
third
be
convicted?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
privilege
you’re
asserting
would
be
inquiries
related
to
the
testimony
--
to
the
legislative
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
there
were
a
separate
prior
act,
that
the
senator
had
been
engaged
in
or
the
aide
had
been
engaged
in,
that
preceded
the
legislative
act,
but
was
connected
with
it,
your
privilege
claim
wouldn't
reach
that
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
a
third
person
could
be
asked
whether
an
aide
or
a
senator
improperly
removed
something
or
stole
something?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
wouldn't
be
a
question
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
or
what
he
did
while
he
was
on
the
staff,
but
wasn't
related
to
a
legislative
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
your
claim
that
indirectly,
in
with
respect
to
the
questions
that
maybe
asked
to
dr.
rodberg,
is
your
claim
that
he
may
not
be
asked
questions
that
he
himself
is
immune
under
the
speech
and
debate
clause
or
is
it
that,
it's
necessary
to
protect
him,
to
protect
--
to
forbid
the
questions
in
order
to
vindicate
senator
gravel’s
speech
and
debate
privilege?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
solicitor
general,
do
you
object
to
the
limitation
that
the
court
of
appeals
put
on
the
witnesses
not
to
testify
or
not
--
they
could
not
be
forced
to
testify
about
the
purposes
and
motives
of
the
senator?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
aren't
interested
in
ever
moving
against
the
senator,
why
would
you
--
why
would
anybody
want
to
inquire
about
the
senator's
motives
and
purposes?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
know,
what
that
word
means?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
that
word
means?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
about
possible
damage
would
there
be
to
the
government
if
they
couldn't
ask
witnesses
about
the
motives
and
purposes
of
senatorial
conduct
if
the
government
absolutely
concedes
is
immune?
justice
byron
r.
white
against
somebody
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
solicitor
general,
positing
that
or
assuming
that
publication
of
documents
in
a
committee
hearing
would
be
criminal
except
for
the
fact
that
it
was
in
a
committee
hearing
and
that
the
senator
or
congressman
himself
couldn't
be
prosecuted
for
that
act
of
putting
the
secret
documents
in
a
committee
hearing
record.
you
would
say
that
the
aides
who
aided
and
abetted
him
and
who
participated
in
that
act
could
be
prosecuted
for
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
to
pay
a
judgment
in
particular
that
there
was
one
recovery?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
suppose
if
senator
in
preparation
for
his
speech
or
debate
committed
a
crime
such
as
--
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
a
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
in
preparation
for
a
senatorial
speech
or
a
committee
hearing,
he
committed
the
crime.
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
your
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
necessary
in
preparation
for
legislative
act,
i
mean
is
criminal
activity
necessarily
to
prepare
for
a
legislative
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
can
say
to
the
(inaudible)
say
prior
to
the
acquisition
(inaudible)
did
you
have
any
conversations
with
anybody
about
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
prior
to
the
acquisition
of
these
papers,
at
any
period
of
time
prior
to
the
acquisition
by
the
senator's
office
of
these
papers,
did
you
have
anything
do
with
the
papers
or
did
you
have
any
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
and
it
said
then
a
theft
on
march
1,
you
could
say
where
were
you
on
march
1?
do
you
know
who
stole
the
papers?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
did
you
know
prior
to
the
acquisition
that
you
are
going
to
acquire
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
senator,
if
the

indicts
someone
for
wiretapping
and
indicts
two
people
for
wiretapping,
and
one
of
them
is
given

justice

yes.
justice
byron

white
the

doesn't

there
are

alright
