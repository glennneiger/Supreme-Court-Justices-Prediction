mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
facts
out
of
which
this
case
arouse
are
extremely
simple.
senator
gravel
is
a
long
time
critique
of
american
involvement
in
southeast
asia.
on
june
29,
1971,
he
convened
the
meeting
of
the
sub-committee
of
the
senate
of
which
he
is
chairman.
after
convening
the
meeting,
he
made
a
speech
in
the
meeting
in
which
he
quoted
extracts
from
the
so
called
pentagon
papers.
after
so
doing
he
inserted
the
pentagon
papers
in
their
entirety
in
the
record
of
the
committee's
hearing.
he
had
--
was
assisted
in
preparing
for
this
meeting
and
for
these
activities
by
his
aide,
dr.
rodberg.
subsequent
to
the
presentation
of
the
pentagon
papers
to
the
committee,
senator
gravel,
acting
through
dr.
rodberg,
undertook
to
find
a
publisher
for
all
these
papers
to
give
then
wider
dissemination
and
--
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
yes
sir
he
was
hired
that
very
day
by
the
senator,
but
the
lower
courts
have
found
that
he
was
an
aide
to
the
senator
and
that
question
is
not
in
controversy.
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
i
believe
there
is
some
evidence
in
the
record
that
he
was
employed.
his
name
was
entered
on
the
record
of
the
department,
but
it
was
not
entered
on
the
records
of
the
financial
clerk.
there
is
however
an
old
controversy
about
his
being
an
aide
to
the
senator
--
to
senator
gravel.
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
yes,
it
seems
to
been
done
rather
on
the
spur
of
the
moment.
as
a
result
of
the
fact
that
then
some
cont
--
some
recent
pentagon
papers
have
some
controversy
in
other
areas
about
publication
--
about
papers
of
the
pentagon
papers.
now
in
this
effort
to
find
a
publisher,
dr.
rodberg
consulted
with
the
witness
webber,
it
was
mentioned
in
the
record
and
also
upon
--
on
behalf
of
senator
gravel
an
agreement
with
the
beacon
press
of
boston
to
publish
the
pentagon
papers
which
had
been
inserted
in
the
committee
records,
in
a
book.
the
government
issued
what
i
call
a
john
doe
grand
jury
investigation
in
the
district
of
massachusetts.
for
the
avowed
purpose,
having
the
grand
jury
investigate
whether
someone
had
violated
the
criminal
statutes
which
put
--
make
on
certain
divisions
to
the
crime,
or
want
to
retain
any
government
records
with
intent
to
convert
them
to
his
own
views.
our
statute
which
makes
it
a
crime
to
gather
and
disseminate
national
defense
information
on
under
circumstances
and
the
statute
which
makes
it
a
crime
to
conceal
or
remove
government
records
and
also
tell
whether
a
conspiracy
had
been
formed
to
violate
any
of
these
statutes.
there
was
subpoena
issued
for
dr.
rodberg
at
the
instance
to
the
government.
there
was
a
subpoena
issued
for
webber.
a
witness
who
had
the
--
had
some
contacts
with
an
unsuccessful
effort
of
dr.
rodberg
to
procure
the
publication
for
senator
gravel
and
the
book
and
then
there
were
two
subpoena
duces
tecums
issued
to
the
beacon
press
to
require
it
to
produce
before
the
grand
jury
any
documents
which
senator
gravel
or
rodberg
had
given
them.
now,
the
controversies,
three
--
there
is
a
controversy
here
between
the
government
on
the
one
hand
and
senator
gravel
on
the
other.
senator
sachs
(ph),
and
i
do
not
hold
a
brief
of
senator
gravel.
we
appear
hear
solely
in
behalf
of
the
united
states
senate.
united
states
senate
takes
this
position
that
a
speech
or
debate
clause
of
section
6
of
article
i
of
the
constitution
says
in
affect
to
the
other
branches
of
the
government,
the
executive
branch
and
the
judicial
branch,
you
must
keep
off
this
legislative
rights.
i
use
this
expression
because
i
was
impressed
by
the
greenest
of
the
grass
as
i
came
over
to
the
court
this
afternoon.
the
senate
does
not
take
the
position
that
it
--
holds
no
brief
for
senator
gravel.
it
merely
holds
--
takes
the
position
that
every
thing
that
senator
gravel
did,
at
least
short
of
the
publication,
was
acted
within
the
general
domain
of
the
legislative
branch
of
the
government
and
that
the
senator
gravel
is
not
accountable
to
the
executive
branch
and
that
he's
not
accountable
to
the
legislate
--
to
the
judicial
branch
of
the
government
for
any
of
his
legislative
activities.
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
i
said
–
i'm
going
to
come
to
that
separately.
i
don't
think
--
i
think
i'll
deal
first
with
the
action
in
the
committee
and
then
deal
with
that
as
a
separate
matter.
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
the
court
implied
to
held
that
in
the
case
of
tenney
against
brandhove
where
the
court
quoted
at
length
and
with
complete
approval
the
decision
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
in
the
case
of
coffin
against
coffin
which
was
handed
down
many,
many
--
right
after
1800
and
they
held
that
it
was
immaterial.
if
the
man
was
acting
within
what
was
traditionally
the
legislative
activity,
it
made
no
difference
whether
these
activities
were
regular
or
irregular
under
the
rules
of
the
legislative
body
of
which
he
was
a
member.
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
oh,
certainly,
that
is
our
position.
in
other
words,
that
this
is
something
that
is
beyond
as
far
as
anything
that
transpired
within
the
scope
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause
of
the
constitution.
it's
something
of
which
the
executive
branch,
or
the
legislative
--
judicial
branch
having
a
constitutional
power
whatsoever
--
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
that's
right.
in
other
words,
the
section
5
of
article
i,
the
preceding
section
to
the
speech
and
debate
clause
expressly
says
that
each
house
shall
determine
the
rules
of
its
proceedings,
may
punish
members
of
disorderly
behavior
and
with
the
concurrence
of
two-thirds
expel
a
member.
and
our
position
is
that
whether
even
though
senator
gravel
may
have
violated
senate
rules
and
even
though
he
may
have
acted
improperly,
that
that
is
a
matter
for
the
judgment
of
the
senate
and
no
other
power
in
our
government
has
right
to
make
any
official
pronouncement
on
that
subject.
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
if
we
authorize
an
investigation?
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
i
doubt
it
very
seriously.
i
doubt
whether
the
congress
can
confer
upon
the
judicial
branch
of
the
government
with
example
--
i
don't
think
it
fall
upon
executive
branch
the
power
to
prosecute
a
senator,
a
representative
or
upon
the
judicial
branches
the
power
to
the
judge
--
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
in
its
function
of
the
government.
in
other
words
i
think
it's
totally,
as
the
germans
would
say
it's
about
both
so
far
as
in
a
branch
of
the
government
in
the
house
of
which
the
party
is
a
member.
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
not
if
it
happens
within
the
domain
of
the
executive
branch
of
the
government.
that's
been
settled,
that's
settled
in
--
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
but
the
decisions
are
to
the
effect
and
i
don't
think
there
is
any
great
controversy
between
(inaudible)
on
this
point.
the
decisions
are
to
the
effect
that
anything
that
happens
within
the
area
which
is
alloted
to
the
legislative
branch
of
the
government
and
which
is
traditionally
done
in
that
branch
is
subject
--
it
could
be
subject
to
liability.
now
there
is
a
distinction
made
between
the
immunity
of
the
legislator
and
the
immunity
of
his
aide.
the
legislator
is
absolutely
immune
even
when
he
engages
in
a
the
non
constitutional
acts,
such
as
for
example,
they
have
spoken
for
the
non-constitutional
resolution
of
bill,
he
is
absolutely
immune,
he
cannot
be
summoned
to
court.
the
aide
however,
can
be
asked
for
to
talk
–
an
action
for
tort
if
--
unless
two
things
concur.
the
aide
must
be
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
employment
by
the
legislator
and
the
activity
of
the
aide
must
occur
within
the
general
domain
of
the
legislative
branches
of
the
government.
if
those
two
things
are
concur,
the
immunity
to
the
aide
is
exactly
like
the
immunity
of
the
legislature,
and
it
is
held
by
the
court
below,
i
think
quite
wiseman
has
held
in
other
cases
that
that
is
so
(inaudible).
the
government
takes
a
very
peculiar
position
in
this
case,
it
takes
a
position
at
the
speech
and
the
debate
clause,
protects
a
legislator
only
in
three
respects.
first,
it
protects
him
against
criminal
prosecution
for
what
transpires
within
the
scope
of
his
legislative
action.
second,
that
it
exempts
him
from
the
civil
liability
and
third
that
it
exempts
him
from
being
the
person
to
be
dragged
before
a
grand
jury
by
subpoena
and
in
the
person
interrogated
by
the
grand
jury,
that's
the
position
of
the
solicitor
general
and
he
takes
a
very
strict
construction
of
--
he
should
place
that
on
the
fact
that
the
clause
says
for
any
speech
or
debate
in
either
house,
they,
that
is
legislators
shall
not
be
questioned
in
any
other
place.
he
says
that,
the
only
people
mentioned
as
the
legislators.
now
that
reminds
me
the
argument
that
was
made
in
the
court
in
venice
when
shylock
demanded
his
pound
of
flesh.
he
said
that
its
nominated
in
the
bond,
i
am
to
get
my
pound
of
flesh.
well
my
reply
to
the
argument
of
solicitor
general
is
that
same
as
posture
made.
it's
also
impliedly
nominated
in
the
bond
that
all
you
get
as
your
pound
of
flesh,
you
don't
get
a
drop
of
blood,
and
this
--
this
bond
in
this
case
could
not
possibly
to
be
subjected
to
the
interpretation
that
the
government
places
upon
it
without
taking
the
life
of
blood
of
the
constitution
because
this
clause
was
imposed
in
--
it
was
placed
in
the
constitution
for
a
two-fold
purpose.
the
first
purpose
was
wrath
on
that
experience
in
the
england
and
there
in
england,
the
quito
and
the
stuart
kings
have
the
members
of
the
parliament
held
in
the
court,
prosecuted,
convicted
and
sentenced
to
jail
falsely,
making
speeches
on
the
floor,
making
speeches
in
parliament
which
was
displeasing
to
the
crown
and
so
in
the
bill
of
rights
of
1688,
the
provision
was
incorporated
that
members
of
the
parliament
should
not
be
called
upon
to
answer
in
any
court
or
in
any
other
places
except
for
parliament
for
their
activities
as
members
of
the
parliament.
and
so
that
was
brought
in
down
prosecution
for
that
reason
and
as
so
well
stated
by
justice
harlan
in
the
johnson
case
for
an
additional
reason.
he
quotes
in
his
very
fine
opinion
in
that
case,
a
statement
of
madison
and
federalist
papers
on
the
separation
of
the
powers
of
the
government.
and
after
pointing
out
how
the
powers
of
the
government
are
separated
by
a
written
constitution
in
this
country,
madison
says
that
the
next
important
thing
is
to
have
some
practical
methods
by
which
to
enforce
the
doctrine
of
the
separation
of
the
powers
and
prevent
one
branch
of
the
government
from
trespassing
upon
the
domain
of
the
other.
and
in
the
johnson
case,
it
is
said
that
the
speech
and
debate
clause
was
one
of
the
practical
obstacles
created
by
the
constitution
to
forbid
the
trespass
by
the
other
branches
of
the
government
upon
the
domain
reserved
by
the
constitution
to
the
legislative
branch.
now
manifestly,
if
you
take
the
interpretation
this
court
would
place
upon
this
false
of
the
constitution,
the
interpretation
for
which
the
government
contends,
it
would
make
the
clause
virtually
worthless
because
it
would
allow
even
aides
of
these
senator,
or
third
parties
to
testify
the
senator's
conduct
within
the
scope
of
his
legislative
activities.
now
the
purpose
of
this
clause
as
the
court
held
in
the
johnson
case
is
to
keep
legislators
from
being
a
accountable
to
the
other
two
branches
of
the
government
and
to
keep
them
from
being
intimated
by
the
other
two
branches
of
the
government.
the
solicitor
general
suggests
that
or
having
the
--
the
senators
conduct
testified
to
by
his
aides
or
by
third
persons
has
no
more
deterrent
effect
on
his
legislative
action.
then
having
him
the
subject
to
the
criticism
of
his
constituents.
well
i
submit
that
that
it's
not
a
valid,
that
shows
it's
not
in
accord
with
the
facts
of
legislative
life.
i
have
spent
about
six
years
serving
in
the
legislature
of
north
carolina
and
altogether
i
have
served
almost
19
years
in
the
congress
in
one
house
or
the
other
and
i
have
to
testify
this
court
that
among
the
most
timid
creatures
i
have
ever
met
are
legislators
and
they
can
cope
with
an
isolated
criticism
of
their
constituents
who
have
right
under
the
constitution
incidentally
to
criticize
them
and
they
can
cope
with
the
criticism
of
the
press
which
has
right
criticize
their
conduct.
but
i
don't
know
anything
that
would
come
nearer
scare
the
poor
senator
or
poor
representative
to
the
death
than
to
have
either
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
with
all
the
might,
governmental
might
which
the
executive
branch
possesses,
or
the
judicial
branch
of
the
government
with
all
of
the
respect
which
the
judicial
branch
enjoys
as
an
impartial
body,
of
holding
a
senator
or
a
congressmen
accountable
not
for
the
legislative
acts
that
they
have
right
to
review
and
exercise
a
judicial
power
to
measure
their
constitutionality
but
to
have
the
power
to
pass
officially
in
any
way,
all
of
their
conduct
as
a
legislator,
that
would
absolutely
destroy
the
independence
of
the
legislative
body.
and
that
was
precisely
the
reason
i
think
the
court
said
in
the
johnson
case,
that
this
was
intended
to
keep
legislators
from
being
held
accountable
to
the
other
branches
of
the
government
or
intimidated
by
the
other
branches
government.
i
respect
to
submit
that
the
question
is
whether
the
dr.
rodberg
is
exempt,
is
the
answer
to
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
johnson
case
where
a
representative
was
prosecuted
for
conflict
of
interest,
the
conspiracy.
and
this
court
said
the
language
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause
clearly
proscribes
at
least
some
of
the
evidence
taken
during
the
trial
exclude
extensive
questioning
without
concerning
how
much
of
the
speech
was
written
by
johnson
himself,
how
much
by
his
administrative
system
and
how
much
by
outsiders
representing
the
loan
company.
the
government
will
try
to
ask
specifically
about
certain
sentences
in
the
speech.
he
has
taken
the
stand
there
in
his
own
behalf
that
the
reasons
for
that
inclusion
and
his
personal
knowledge
of
the
facts
and
materials
supporting
those
statements.
in
closing
our
argument
the
theory
of
the
prosecution
was
very
clearly
depended
upon
the
wording
of
the
speech
in
addition
to
questioning
the
mammoth
preparation
and
the
precise
ingredients
of
the
speech,
the
government
inquired
into
the
motives
for
giving
it.
the
constitutional
infirmity,
in
fact,
this
prosecution
is
not
merely
a
matter
of
introduction
of
inadmissible
evidence.
the
attention
given
to
the
speech
of
substance
and
the
motivation
was
not
an
incidental
part
of
the
government's
case
which
might
have
then
aborted
by
omitting
certain
lines
of
questioning
or
excluding
certain
evidence.
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
then
the
court
concludes,
we
see
in
our
state
from
the
conclusion,
that
an
(inaudible)
judicial
inquiry
made
in
the
course
of
a
prosecution
by
the
executive
branch
under
a
general
conspiracy
statute,
violates
express
language
of
the
constitution
on
the
policies
which
under
--
i
believe
my
time
has
expired.
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
i
am
sorry,
i
didn't
get
time
to
allude
to
the
question
that
--
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
i
think
there
are
two
practical
limits.
one
is
his
allowance
to
compensation
of
legislative
aides
and
another
is
his
office
space
he
has
got.
i
don't
exhaust
my
allowance
but
my
office
space
is
so
limited
i
couldn't
find
another
chair
for
giving
it
another
one
to
sit
on
[attempt
to
laughter].
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
well
i
think
it
would
be
impractical.
i
think
that
sounds
to
have
many
probably
ought
be
removed
for
mental
incapacity.
[laughter]
i
think
as
long
as
the
senator
is
getting
assistance
from
the
man
--
performance
of
any
of
his
senatorial
functions
or
what
he
conceives
to
be
a
senatorial
functions
at,
there
is
no
limit.
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
well
frankly,
i
would
give
it
a
liberal
amount
of
interpretation
do
that.
i
think
anyone
who
assists
a
senator
in
the
performance
of
his
legislative
functions
is
exempt
--
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
or
compensation.
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
or
congressman,
yes.
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
the
senators
themselves
probably
if
you
wrapped
up
to
both
of
senators,
it
would
be
divided
on
--
i
myself
take
the
position
that
that
would
be
covered
either
by
the
speech
or
debate
clause
or
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
justice
douglas
wrote
a
marvelous
opinion
in
the
rumley
(ph)
case
and
richard
rumley
(ph)
was
someone
before
the
un-american
activists,
i
hope
his
is
not
being
charged
off.
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
he
was
someone
for
the
un-american
activists
committed
the
house
unless
called
upon
to
divulge
to
the
committee,
the
names
of
all
of
the
persons
who
had
both
of
--
his
books
he
published
them
above
quantities.
he
refused
to
produce
them
and
was
prosecuted
for
contempt
of
the
committee
and
this
court
held
that
he
was
protected
by
the
first
amendment
and
the
majority
of
the
court
held
in
the
opinion
by
justice
frankfurter
that
the
prosecution
was
unsupportable
because
the
committee
was
not
authorized
by
resolution
going
into
this
activity
to
conduct
this
investigation.
but
mr.
justice
douglas
and
while
i
think
one
of
the
finest
opinions
he
or
any
other
member
of
this
court
has
ever
written,
he
said
he
meant
the
constitutional
problem.
justice
frankfurter
said
if
they
place
the
interpretation
only
resolution
that
the
committee
did
have
the
power
to
compel
the
publisher,
to
disclose
the
names
of
the
purchasers
of
his
books,
that
would
raise
the
serious
constitutional
question.
mr.
justice
douglas
wrote
an
opinion
in
which
justice
blackmun
concurred,
in
which
he
says
(inaudible)
than
to
the
constitutional
questions.
respondent
represents
a
statement
of
the
american
press
some
may
like
what
he
publishes,
others
may
disapprove.
these
tracks
maybe
the
essence
of
wisdom
to
come
to
others
that
point
of
view
and
philosophy
would
be
on
that.
to
someone
else
that
words
may
be
harsh
and
impulsive,
to
others
they
may
carry
the
hope
of
the
future.
we
have
publisher
who
through
books
and
pamphlets
seeks
to
reach
the
minds
and
hearts
of
the
american
people.
the
aim
of
the
historic
struggle
for
free
press
was
to
establish
and
preserve
the
right
of
the
english
people
to
full
information
with
respect
to
doings
or
misdoings
of
their
government.
well,
that
is
not
cited
in
the
brief,
it
occurred
to
me
last
might,
but
i
think
this
on
that
point.
i
think
that
some
that
–
that
woodrow
wilson
said
one
of
the
most
important
functions
of
congressman,
his
important
function
he
has
a
duty
to
inform
his
colleagues,
the
duty
to
inform
his
constituents,
the
duty
to
inform
the
general
public
about
he
thinks
the
government
is
being
run.
they
now
use
not
only
the
with
congressional
record
and
the
committee
reports,
but
in
many
instances
congressmen
use
a
radio
and
a
television,
they
are
right
books
on
the
subject
and
i
think
that
this
speech
and
debate
clause
is
broad
enough
to
cover
any
activity
where
a
senator
or
congressmen
attempts
to
inform
either
his
colleagues
or
his
constituents
or
the
general
public
and
i
think
it's
protected
by
the
speech
and
debate
clause.
but,
i
think
if
he
is
not
protected
by
the
speech
and
debate
clause,
then
he
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment
because
everybody
gets
a
right
to
comment
on
the
government
under
the
first
amendment.
and
i
think
that
if
you
could
summon
even
third
parties
and
the
court
held
in
this
case
you
couldn't
summon
third
parties
to
testify
to
the
meeting
of
the
committee,
but
i
think
if
you
summon
third
parties
that
if
you
do
not
transgress,
regardless
the
third
party
should
testify
that
action
of
a
senator
or
congressman
and
inform
his
constituents,
that
is
covered
by
the
speech
and
debate
clause,
but
it
is
not
covered
in
that
by
is
right
as
a
citizen
under
first
amendment
because
if
you
intimidate
a
publisher
or
a
publisher
acting
for
senator,
by
asking
him
to
the
divulge
names
of
the
purchasers
of
this
book
just
equals
as
intimidating
having
official
inquiry
made
by
the
government
as
to
the
circumstances
under
which
they
agreed
to
publish
the
book.
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
facts
out
of
which
this
case
arouse
are
extremely
simple.
senator
gravel
is
a
long
time
critique
of
american
involvement
in
southeast
asia.
on
june
29,
1971,
he
convened
the
meeting
of
the
sub-committee
of
the
senate
of
which
he
is
chairman.
after
convening
the
meeting,
he
made
a
speech
in
the
meeting
in
which
he
quoted
extracts
from
the
so
called
pentagon
papers.
after
so
doing
he
inserted
the
pentagon
papers
in
their
entirety
in
the
record
of
the
committee's
hearing.
he
had
--
was
assisted
in
preparing
for
this
meeting
and
for
these
activities
by
his
aide,
dr.
rodberg.
subsequent
to
the
presentation
of
the
pentagon
papers
to
the
committee,
senator
gravel,
acting
through
dr.
rodberg,
undertook
to
find
a
publisher
for
all
these
papers
to
give
then
wider
dissemination
and
--
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
yes
sir
he
was
hired
that
very
day
by
the
senator,
but
the
lower
courts
have
found
that
he
was
an
aide
to
the
senator
and
that
question
is
not
in
controversy.
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
i
believe
there
is
some
evidence
in
the
record
that
he
was
employed.
his
name
was
entered
on
the
record
of
the
department,
but
it
was
not
entered
on
the
records
of
the
financial
clerk.
there
is
however
an
old
controversy
about
his
being
an
aide
to
the
senator
--
to
senator
gravel.
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
yes,
it
seems
to
been
done
rather
on
the
spur
of
the
moment.
as
a
result
of
the
fact
that
then
some
cont
--
some
recent
pentagon
papers
have
some
controversy
in
other
areas
about
publication
--
about
papers
of
the
pentagon
papers.
now
in
this
effort
to
find
a
publisher,
dr.
rodberg
consulted
with
the
witness
webber,
it
was
mentioned
in
the
record
and
also
upon
--
on
behalf
of
senator
gravel
an
agreement
with
the
beacon
press
of
boston
to
publish
the
pentagon
papers
which
had
been
inserted
in
the
committee
records,
in
a
book.
the
government
issued
what
i
call
a
john
doe
grand
jury
investigation
in
the
district
of
massachusetts.
for
the
avowed
purpose,
having
the
grand
jury
investigate
whether
someone
had
violated
the
criminal
statutes
which
put
--
make
on
certain
divisions
to
the
crime,
or
want
to
retain
any
government
records
with
intent
to
convert
them
to
his
own
views.
our
statute
which
makes
it
a
crime
to
gather
and
disseminate
national
defense
information
on
under
circumstances
and
the
statute
which
makes
it
a
crime
to
conceal
or
remove
government
records
and
also
tell
whether
a
conspiracy
had
been
formed
to
violate
any
of
these
statutes.
there
was
subpoena
issued
for
dr.
rodberg
at
the
instance
to
the
government.
there
was
a
subpoena
issued
for
webber.
a
witness
who
had
the
--
had
some
contacts
with
an
unsuccessful
effort
of
dr.
rodberg
to
procure
the
publication
for
senator
gravel
and
the
book
and
then
there
were
two
subpoena
duces
tecums
issued
to
the
beacon
press
to
require
it
to
produce
before
the
grand
jury
any
documents
which
senator
gravel
or
rodberg
had
given
them.
now,
the
controversies,
three
--
there
is
a
controversy
here
between
the
government
on
the
one
hand
and
senator
gravel
on
the
other.
senator
sachs
(ph),
and
i
do
not
hold
a
brief
of
senator
gravel.
we
appear
hear
solely
in
behalf
of
the
united
states
senate.
united
states
senate
takes
this
position
that
a
speech
or
debate
clause
of
section
6
of
article
i
of
the
constitution
says
in
affect
to
the
other
branches
of
the
government,
the
executive
branch
and
the
judicial
branch,
you
must
keep
off
this
legislative
rights.
i
use
this
expression
because
i
was
impressed
by
the
greenest
of
the
grass
as
i
came
over
to
the
court
this
afternoon.
the
senate
does
not
take
the
position
that
it
--
holds
no
brief
for
senator
gravel.
it
merely
holds
--
takes
the
position
that
every
thing
that
senator
gravel
did,
at
least
short
of
the
publication,
was
acted
within
the
general
domain
of
the
legislative
branch
of
the
government
and
that
the
senator
gravel
is
not
accountable
to
the
executive
branch
and
that
he's
not
accountable
to
the
legislate
--
to
the
judicial
branch
of
the
government
for
any
of
his
legislative
activities.
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
i
said
–
i'm
going
to
come
to
that
separately.
i
don't
think
--
i
think
i'll
deal
first
with
the
action
in
the
committee
and
then
deal
with
that
as
a
separate
matter.
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
the
court
implied
to
held
that
in
the
case
of
tenney
against
brandhove
where
the
court
quoted
at
length
and
with
complete
approval
the
decision
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
in
the
case
of
coffin
against
coffin
which
was
handed
down
many,
many
--
right
after
1800
and
they
held
that
it
was
immaterial.
if
the
man
was
acting
within
what
was
traditionally
the
legislative
activity,
it
made
no
difference
whether
these
activities
were
regular
or
irregular
under
the
rules
of
the
legislative
body
of
which
he
was
a
member.
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
oh,
certainly,
that
is
our
position.
in
other
words,
that
this
is
something
that
is
beyond
as
far
as
anything
that
transpired
within
the
scope
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause
of
the
constitution.
it's
something
of
which
the
executive
branch,
or
the
legislative
--
judicial
branch
having
a
constitutional
power
whatsoever
--
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
that's
right.
in
other
words,
the
section
5
of
article
i,
the
preceding
section
to
the
speech
and
debate
clause
expressly
says
that
each
house
shall
determine
the
rules
of
its
proceedings,
may
punish
members
of
disorderly
behavior
and
with
the
concurrence
of
two-thirds
expel
a
member.
and
our
position
is
that
whether
even
though
senator
gravel
may
have
violated
senate
rules
and
even
though
he
may
have
acted
improperly,
that
that
is
a
matter
for
the
judgment
of
the
senate
and
no
other
power
in
our
government
has
right
to
make
any
official
pronouncement
on
that
subject.
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
if
we
authorize
an
investigation?
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
i
doubt
it
very
seriously.
i
doubt
whether
the
congress
can
confer
upon
the
judicial
branch
of
the
government
with
example
--
i
don't
think
it
fall
upon
executive
branch
the
power
to
prosecute
a
senator,
a
representative
or
upon
the
judicial
branches
the
power
to
the
judge
--
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
in
its
function
of
the
government.
in
other
words
i
think
it's
totally,
as
the
germans
would
say
it's
about
both
so
far
as
in
a
branch
of
the
government
in
the
house
of
which
the
party
is
a
member.
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
not
if
it
happens
within
the
domain
of
the
executive
branch
of
the
government.
that's
been
settled,
that's
settled
in
--
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
but
the
decisions
are
to
the
effect
and
i
don't
think
there
is
any
great
controversy
between
(inaudible)
on
this
point.
the
decisions
are
to
the
effect
that
anything
that
happens
within
the
area
which
is
alloted
to
the
legislative
branch
of
the
government
and
which
is
traditionally
done
in
that
branch
is
subject
--
it
could
be
subject
to
liability.
now
there
is
a
distinction
made
between
the
immunity
of
the
legislator
and
the
immunity
of
his
aide.
the
legislator
is
absolutely
immune
even
when
he
engages
in
a
the
non
constitutional
acts,
such
as
for
example,
they
have
spoken
for
the
non-constitutional
resolution
of
bill,
he
is
absolutely
immune,
he
cannot
be
summoned
to
court.
the
aide
however,
can
be
asked
for
to
talk
–
an
action
for
tort
if
--
unless
two
things
concur.
the
aide
must
be
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
employment
by
the
legislator
and
the
activity
of
the
aide
must
occur
within
the
general
domain
of
the
legislative
branches
of
the
government.
if
those
two
things
are
concur,
the
immunity
to
the
aide
is
exactly
like
the
immunity
of
the
legislature,
and
it
is
held
by
the
court
below,
i
think
quite
wiseman
has
held
in
other
cases
that
that
is
so
(inaudible).
the
government
takes
a
very
peculiar
position
in
this
case,
it
takes
a
position
at
the
speech
and
the
debate
clause,
protects
a
legislator
only
in
three
respects.
first,
it
protects
him
against
criminal
prosecution
for
what
transpires
within
the
scope
of
his
legislative
action.
second,
that
it
exempts
him
from
the
civil
liability
and
third
that
it
exempts
him
from
being
the
person
to
be
dragged
before
a
grand
jury
by
subpoena
and
in
the
person
interrogated
by
the
grand
jury,
that's
the
position
of
the
solicitor
general
and
he
takes
a
very
strict
construction
of
--
he
should
place
that
on
the
fact
that
the
clause
says
for
any
speech
or
debate
in
either
house,
they,
that
is
legislators
shall
not
be
questioned
in
any
other
place.
he
says
that,
the
only
people
mentioned
as
the
legislators.
now
that
reminds
me
the
argument
that
was
made
in
the
court
in
venice
when
shylock
demanded
his
pound
of
flesh.
he
said
that
its
nominated
in
the
bond,
i
am
to
get
my
pound
of
flesh.
well
my
reply
to
the
argument
of
solicitor
general
is
that
same
as
posture
made.
it's
also
impliedly
nominated
in
the
bond
that
all
you
get
as
your
pound
of
flesh,
you
don't
get
a
drop
of
blood,
and
this
--
this
bond
in
this
case
could
not
possibly
to
be
subjected
to
the
interpretation
that
the
government
places
upon
it
without
taking
the
life
of
blood
of
the
constitution
because
this
clause
was
imposed
in
--
it
was
placed
in
the
constitution
for
a
two-fold
purpose.
the
first
purpose
was
wrath
on
that
experience
in
the
england
and
there
in
england,
the
quito
and
the
stuart
kings
have
the
members
of
the
parliament
held
in
the
court,
prosecuted,
convicted
and
sentenced
to
jail
falsely,
making
speeches
on
the
floor,
making
speeches
in
parliament
which
was
displeasing
to
the
crown
and
so
in
the
bill
of
rights
of
1688,
the
provision
was
incorporated
that
members
of
the
parliament
should
not
be
called
upon
to
answer
in
any
court
or
in
any
other
places
except
for
parliament
for
their
activities
as
members
of
the
parliament.
and
so
that
was
brought
in
down
prosecution
for
that
reason
and
as
so
well
stated
by
justice
harlan
in
the
johnson
case
for
an
additional
reason.
he
quotes
in
his
very
fine
opinion
in
that
case,
a
statement
of
madison
and
federalist
papers
on
the
separation
of
the
powers
of
the
government.
and
after
pointing
out
how
the
powers
of
the
government
are
separated
by
a
written
constitution
in
this
country,
madison
says
that
the
next
important
thing
is
to
have
some
practical
methods
by
which
to
enforce
the
doctrine
of
the
separation
of
the
powers
and
prevent
one
branch
of
the
government
from
trespassing
upon
the
domain
of
the
other.
and
in
the
johnson
case,
it
is
said
that
the
speech
and
debate
clause
was
one
of
the
practical
obstacles
created
by
the
constitution
to
forbid
the
trespass
by
the
other
branches
of
the
government
upon
the
domain
reserved
by
the
constitution
to
the
legislative
branch.
now
manifestly,
if
you
take
the
interpretation
this
court
would
place
upon
this
false
of
the
constitution,
the
interpretation
for
which
the
government
contends,
it
would
make
the
clause
virtually
worthless
because
it
would
allow
even
aides
of
these
senator,
or
third
parties
to
testify
the
senator's
conduct
within
the
scope
of
his
legislative
activities.
now
the
purpose
of
this
clause
as
the
court
held
in
the
johnson
case
is
to
keep
legislators
from
being
a
accountable
to
the
other
two
branches
of
the
government
and
to
keep
them
from
being
intimated
by
the
other
two
branches
of
the
government.
the
solicitor
general
suggests
that
or
having
the
--
the
senators
conduct
testified
to
by
his
aides
or
by
third
persons
has
no
more
deterrent
effect
on
his
legislative
action.
then
having
him
the
subject
to
the
criticism
of
his
constituents.
well
i
submit
that
that
it's
not
a
valid,
that
shows
it's
not
in
accord
with
the
facts
of
legislative
life.
i
have
spent
about
six
years
serving
in
the
legislature
of
north
carolina
and
altogether
i
have
served
almost
19
years
in
the
congress
in
one
house
or
the
other
and
i
have
to
testify
this
court
that
among
the
most
timid
creatures
i
have
ever
met
are
legislators
and
they
can
cope
with
an
isolated
criticism
of
their
constituents
who
have
right
under
the
constitution
incidentally
to
criticize
them
and
they
can
cope
with
the
criticism
of
the
press
which
has
right
criticize
their
conduct.
but
i
don't
know
anything
that
would
come
nearer
scare
the
poor
senator
or
poor
representative
to
the
death
than
to
have
either
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
with
all
the
might,
governmental
might
which
the
executive
branch
possesses,
or
the
judicial
branch
of
the
government
with
all
of
the
respect
which
the
judicial
branch
enjoys
as
an
impartial
body,
of
holding
a
senator
or
a
congressmen
accountable
not
for
the
legislative
acts
that
they
have
right
to
review
and
exercise
a
judicial
power
to
measure
their
constitutionality
but
to
have
the
power
to
pass
officially
in
any
way,
all
of
their
conduct
as
a
legislator,
that
would
absolutely
destroy
the
independence
of
the
legislative
body.
and
that
was
precisely
the
reason
i
think
the
court
said
in
the
johnson
case,
that
this
was
intended
to
keep
legislators
from
being
held
accountable
to
the
other
branches
of
the
government
or
intimidated
by
the
other
branches
government.
i
respect
to
submit
that
the
question
is
whether
the
dr.
rodberg
is
exempt,
is
the
answer
to
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
johnson
case
where
a
representative
was
prosecuted
for
conflict
of
interest,
the
conspiracy.
and
this
court
said
the
language
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause
clearly
proscribes
at
least
some
of
the
evidence
taken
during
the
trial
exclude
extensive
questioning
without
concerning
how
much
of
the
speech
was
written
by
johnson
himself,
how
much
by
his
administrative
system
and
how
much
by
outsiders
representing
the
loan
company.
the
government
will
try
to
ask
specifically
about
certain
sentences
in
the
speech.
he
has
taken
the
stand
there
in
his
own
behalf
that
the
reasons
for
that
inclusion
and
his
personal
knowledge
of
the
facts
and
materials
supporting
those
statements.
in
closing
our
argument
the
theory
of
the
prosecution
was
very
clearly
depended
upon
the
wording
of
the
speech
in
addition
to
questioning
the
mammoth
preparation
and
the
precise
ingredients
of
the
speech,
the
government
inquired
into
the
motives
for
giving
it.
the
constitutional
infirmity,
in
fact,
this
prosecution
is
not
merely
a
matter
of
introduction
of
inadmissible
evidence.
the
attention
given
to
the
speech
of
substance
and
the
motivation
was
not
an
incidental
part
of
the
government's
case
which
might
have
then
aborted
by
omitting
certain
lines
of
questioning
or
excluding
certain
evidence.
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
then
the
court
concludes,
we
see
in
our
state
from
the
conclusion,
that
an
(inaudible)
judicial
inquiry
made
in
the
course
of
a
prosecution
by
the
executive
branch
under
a
general
conspiracy
statute,
violates
express
language
of
the
constitution
on
the
policies
which
under
--
i
believe
my
time
has
expired.
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
i
am
sorry,
i
didn't
get
time
to
allude
to
the
question
that
--
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
i
think
there
are
two
practical
limits.
one
is
his
allowance
to
compensation
of
legislative
aides
and
another
is
his
office
space
he
has
got.
i
don't
exhaust
my
allowance
but
my
office
space
is
so
limited
i
couldn't
find
another
chair
for
giving
it
another
one
to
sit
on
[attempt
to
laughter].
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
well
i
think
it
would
be
impractical.
i
think
that
sounds
to
have
many
probably
ought
be
removed
for
mental
incapacity.
[laughter]
i
think
as
long
as
the
senator
is
getting
assistance
from
the
man
--
performance
of
any
of
his
senatorial
functions
or
what
he
conceives
to
be
a
senatorial
functions
at,
there
is
no
limit.
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
well
frankly,
i
would
give
it
a
liberal
amount
of
interpretation
do
that.
i
think
anyone
who
assists
a
senator
in
the
performance
of
his
legislative
functions
is
exempt
--
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
or
compensation.
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
or
congressman,
yes.
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
the
senators
themselves
probably
if
you
wrapped
up
to
both
of
senators,
it
would
be
divided
on
--
i
myself
take
the
position
that
that
would
be
covered
either
by
the
speech
or
debate
clause
or
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
justice
douglas
wrote
a
marvelous
opinion
in
the
rumley
(ph)
case
and
richard
rumley
(ph)
was
someone
before
the
un-american
activists,
i
hope
his
is
not
being
charged
off.
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
he
was
someone
for
the
un-american
activists
committed
the
house
unless
called
upon
to
divulge
to
the
committee,
the
names
of
all
of
the
persons
who
had
both
of
--
his
books
he
published
them
above
quantities.
he
refused
to
produce
them
and
was
prosecuted
for
contempt
of
the
committee
and
this
court
held
that
he
was
protected
by
the
first
amendment
and
the
majority
of
the
court
held
in
the
opinion
by
justice
frankfurter
that
the
prosecution
was
unsupportable
because
the
committee
was
not
authorized
by
resolution
going
into
this
activity
to
conduct
this
investigation.
but
mr.
justice
douglas
and
while
i
think
one
of
the
finest
opinions
he
or
any
other
member
of
this
court
has
ever
written,
he
said
he
meant
the
constitutional
problem.
justice
frankfurter
said
if
they
place
the
interpretation
only
resolution
that
the
committee
did
have
the
power
to
compel
the
publisher,
to
disclose
the
names
of
the
purchasers
of
his
books,
that
would
raise
the
serious
constitutional
question.
mr.
justice
douglas
wrote
an
opinion
in
which
justice
blackmun
concurred,
in
which
he
says
(inaudible)
than
to
the
constitutional
questions.
respondent
represents
a
statement
of
the
american
press
some
may
like
what
he
publishes,
others
may
disapprove.
these
tracks
maybe
the
essence
of
wisdom
to
come
to
others
that
point
of
view
and
philosophy
would
be
on
that.
to
someone
else
that
words
may
be
harsh
and
impulsive,
to
others
they
may
carry
the
hope
of
the
future.
we
have
publisher
who
through
books
and
pamphlets
seeks
to
reach
the
minds
and
hearts
of
the
american
people.
the
aim
of
the
historic
struggle
for
free
press
was
to
establish
and
preserve
the
right
of
the
english
people
to
full
information
with
respect
to
doings
or
misdoings
of
their
government.
well,
that
is
not
cited
in
the
brief,
it
occurred
to
me
last
might,
but
i
think
this
on
that
point.
i
think
that
some
that
–
that
woodrow
wilson
said
one
of
the
most
important
functions
of
congressman,
his
important
function
he
has
a
duty
to
inform
his
colleagues,
the
duty
to
inform
his
constituents,
the
duty
to
inform
the
general
public
about
he
thinks
the
government
is
being
run.
they
now
use
not
only
the
with
congressional
record
and
the
committee
reports,
but
in
many
instances
congressmen
use
a
radio
and
a
television,
they
are
right
books
on
the
subject
and
i
think
that
this
speech
and
debate
clause
is
broad
enough
to
cover
any
activity
where
a
senator
or
congressmen
attempts
to
inform
either
his
colleagues
or
his
constituents
or
the
general
public
and
i
think
it's
protected
by
the
speech
and
debate
clause.
but,
i
think
if
he
is
not
protected
by
the
speech
and
debate
clause,
then
he
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment
because
everybody
gets
a
right
to
comment
on
the
government
under
the
first
amendment.
and
i
think
that
if
you
could
summon
even
third
parties
and
the
court
held
in
this
case
you
couldn't
summon
third
parties
to
testify
to
the
meeting
of
the
committee,
but
i
think
if
you
summon
third
parties
that
if
you
do
not
transgress,
regardless
the
third
party
should
testify
that
action
of
a
senator
or
congressman
and
inform
his
constituents,
that
is
covered
by
the
speech
and
debate
clause,
but
it
is
not
covered
in
that
by
is
right
as
a
citizen
under
first
amendment
because
if
you
intimidate
a
publisher
or
a
publisher
acting
for
senator,
by
asking
him
to
the
divulge
names
of
the
purchasers
of
this
book
just
equals
as
intimidating
having
official
inquiry
made
by
the
government
as
to
the
circumstances
under
which
they
agreed
to
publish
the
book.
