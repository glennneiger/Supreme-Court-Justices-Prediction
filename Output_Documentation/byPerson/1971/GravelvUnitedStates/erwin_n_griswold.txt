mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
first
in
supplementing
the
response
to
mr.
justice
blackmun's
question,
i
think
it
may
be
said
that,
dr.
rodberg
is
the
physicist.
in
my
view
this
case
does
not
involve
any
fair
application
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
the
case
has
now
been
argued
before
the
court
for
nearly
an
hour
and
no
one
has
yet
referred
to
the
text
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
it
appears
at
the
bottom
of
page
2
and
the
top
of
page
3,
of
the
government's
principal
brief
here.
of
course,
i
know
it
is
familiar
to
the
court,
although
it
has
been
involved
in
a
surprisingly
small
number
of
decisions
of
this
court.
but
it
seems
to
me,
relevant
and
appropriate,
that
before
proceeding
further
with
this
case,
we
get
back
to
the
bedrock.
what
does
the
constitution
say?
the
senators
and
representatives,
nobody
else,
the
senators
and
representatives
shall
receive
compensation
and
they
shall
in
all
cases,
except
treason,
felony
and
breach
of
the
peace,
which
covers
almost
everything,
be
privileged
from
arrest
during
their
attendance
at
the
session
of
their
respective
houses,
no
effort
to
give
a
sweeping
immunity
to
congressman
or
senators,
and
in
going
to
and
returning
from
the
same,
and
for
any
speech
or
debate
in
either
house,
they
shall
not
be
questioned
in
any
other
place.
now
there
are
three
groups
of
words
of
limitation
in
that
provision.
the
senators
and
representatives,
not
the
senators
and
representatives
and
those
associated
with
him
and
those
who
assist
him
and
members
of
their
family
and
staff
and
servants
as
it
used
to
be
in
england,
and
which
they
we're
trying
to
get
away
from,
and
speech
or
debate.
now
speech
or
debate
is
not
everything
they
say,
everything
they
do,
and
finally
in
either
house.
it
is
suggested
that
our
argument
here,
and
i
must
confess
i
have
a
little
feeling
like,
arguing
that
no
law
means
no
law,
but
it
is
suggested
that,
our
reference
to
stylistic
precision
which
is
the
phrase
we
use
in
our
brief.
this
is
a
case
where
it
seems
to
me,
that
the
language
was
very
carefully
written
and
very
carefully
intended.
it
is
suggested
that,
this
is
simply
the
language
of
the
committee
on
style.
they
didn't
mean
any
such
limitations
and
that
that
there
is
evidence
by
the
language
which
had
been
used
by
the
committee
on
detail,
which
was
the
only
place
in
the
convention
where
the
matter
was
considered.
there
surprisingly
there
is
very
little
available
in
the
history
of
the
convention,
but
let's
look
at
the
language
which
had
been
used
by
the
committee
on
detail.
this
appears
at
the
bottom
of
page
92
of
the
big
red
brief,
senator
gravel's
main
brief.
now
the
committee
on
detail
and
which
is
what
the
convention
voted
for
wrote,
freedom
of
speech
and
debate
in
the
legislature.
well
now
who
engages
in
speech
or
debate
in
the
legislature,
no
one
but
senators
and
representatives.
freedom
of
speech
and
debate
in
the
legislature
shall
not
be
impeached
or
questioned
in
any
court
or
place,
out
of
the
legislature.
and
i
would
suggest
that
there
is
no
significant
difference
in
meaning,
between
the
phraseology
of
the
committee
on
detail
and
that
of
the
committee
on
style.
the
committee
on
style
did
make
it
a
little
more
elegant,
but
it
did
not
limit
it
beyond
what
had
been
adopted
before.
now
the
significant
fact
in
this
case
with
respect
to
this
language,
is
that
the
senator
gravel
is
not
being
questioned
by
anybody
in
any
place.
the
constitution
and
the
privilege
granted
by
the
constitution
to
senators
and
representatives
is
being
fully
compelled
with.
there
is
an
analysis
of
this
clause,
which
as
far
as
i
know
does
not
appear
as
yet
in
any
of
the
opinions
of
this
court,
but
which
i
think
clarifies
it's
meaning
and
application,
and
on
the
basis
of
which
the
privilege
itself,
and
the
several
cases
which
have
been
decided
about
it
fall
very
well
in
the
place.
questioned,
is
the
keyword
at
the
end
of
this
constitutional
provision,
and
questioned
may
be
read
in
two
senses.
first,
as
i
have
just
indicated
with
respect
to
questioning
senator
gravel.
perfectly
clear
that
senator
gravel
cannot
be
questioned
about
any
speech
or
debate
which
he
has
made.
it's
not
necessary
here
to
determine
the
limits
of
speech
or
debate,
because
senator
gravel
is
not
being
questioned.
no
subpoena
has
been
issued
against
senator
gravel.
there
is
no
suggestion
that
he
is
being
questioned,
but
the
word
question
can
also
be
read
in
another
sense,
that
is
of
being
subject
to
charges
in
which
reliance
is
put
on
evidence
of
speeches
or
debates
by
the
member.
but
senator
gravel
is
not
being
questioned
in
this
sense.
he
has
not
been
charged
with
anything.
he
is
not
on
trial,
there
is
not
a
question
of
the
use
of
evidence
of
other
persons
with
respect
to
a
speech
or
debate
being
directed
against
him.
he
has
not
been
indicted,
he
has
not
been
summoned,
he
is
not
subject
to
charges,
and
i
would
suggest
that
when
those
conditions
exists,
the
speech
or
debate
clause
is
fully
satisfied.
this
case
is
not
like
the
johnson
case,
in
this
court.
the
johnson
case
was
an
indictment
of
a
congressman,
based
upon
facts
arising
out
of
a
speech
which
he
had
made
in
the
house
of
representatives.
and
the
court
held
that
evidence
with
respect
to
that
speech
could
not
be
introduced
in
the
trial
against
johnson
without
violating
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
it
was
not
merely
that
he
could
not
be
someone
than
required
to
testify,
but
he
could
not
be
required
to
answer
a
charge
based
upon
the
speech
which
he
had
given.
that
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
senator
gravel
had
not
been
summoned
and
required
to
testify.
he
is
not
required
to
answer
a
charge
based
upon
the
speech,
but
this
case
is
like
the
johnson
case
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
before
it
got
here.
you
will
recall
that
there
were
two
congressman
who
were
indicted,
and
two
private
individuals,
and
they
were
all
indicted
for
conspiracy,
and
for
engaging
in
certain
acts
or
in
aiding
or
abetting
those
acts.
and
it
is
true
that
the
court
referred
on
page
176,
in
the
johnson
opinion
to
the
fact
that,
the
constitutional
infirmity
infecting
this
prosecution
is
not
merely
a
matter
of
the
introduction
of
inadmissible
evidence
and
senator
gravel
in
his
brief
says
that
that's
a
decision
that
this
evidence
is
inadmissible,
and
therefore
can't
be
acquired.
well,
we
agree
that
it
is
inadmissible
against
senator
gravel,
if
there
ever
should
be
any
sort
of
a
charge
against
senator
gravel.
but
the
johnson
case
in
the
fourth
circuit,
involved
two
persons
who
were
not
congressmen
and
their
convictions
were
sustained
in
the
variable
opinion
of
chief
judge
soboloff.
i've
read
it
again
a
few
days
ago,
and
it
is
a
remarkably
fine
opinion
and
this
is
the
language
which
is
used
with
respect
to
them
at
page
193
of
337
f2nd.
count
one
of
the
indictment
is
unconstitutional,
as
applied
to
defendant
johnson,
but
as
none
of
the
privileges
of
article
1,
section
6,
pertain
to
the
defendants
who
are
not
members
of
congress,
their
attack
on
the
first
count
unlike
jonson's
is
not
sustained.
now
it
is
true
that
that
this
court
did
not
review
that
decision,
and
expressly
left
open
its
propriety
and
the
decision
in
the
johnson
case
itself
which
involved
only
congressman
johnson,
but
i
submit
that
the
decision
reached
by
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
chief
judge
siboloff's
opinion
is
a
sound
construction.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
involved
both
the
conspiracy
to
give
and
accept
--
well,
it
involved
both
the
conspiracy
and
the
substantive
offense.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
were
five
or
six
accounts
of
the
substantive
offense
of
--
as
i
record
mr.
justice
,
conflict
of
interest
rather
than
of
bribing
(voice
overlap)
and
appearing
before
the
executive
branch
of
the
government.
as
you
will
recall,
the
case
went
back
to
the
trial
court.
congressman
johnson
was
convicted
without
the
use
of
the
evidence
of
the
speech.
that
conviction
was
affirmed
by
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
this
court
denied
certiorari.
it
is
also
true
that
the
two
other
persons
in
the
johnson
case
were
not
aides.
they
were
private
citizens,
although
they
were
actually
aiding
congressman
johnson
and
i
suppose
he
could
have
put
his
finger
down,
somebody
and
said
you're
now
my
aides
and
since
no
payroll
provision
was
involved,
they
could
have
been
the
same,
but
there
is
no
suggestion
that
they
were
nevertheless,
i
repeat
my
suggestion
for
the
court's
consideration
that
article
1,
section
6
does
not
provide
any
protection
to
anyone
except
senators
and
representatives.
it
does
not
provide
any
protection
to
aides.
i
know
of
no
decision
of
this
court
which
has
held
that
aides
or
third
persons
are
entitled
to
any
benefits
under
the
speech
and
debates
clause.
perfectly
plain
that
congressmen
and
senators
are
entitled
to
great
benefits
under
the
speech
and
debate
clause
and
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
which
in
any
way
impairs
the
privilege
which
is
given
to
senator
gravel
by
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
he
is
not
being
subject
to
question
himself.
he
is
not
being
required
to
answer
to
charges
based
upon
evidence
relating
to
a
speech
or
debate.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
in
the
first
place
the
limits
of
the
executive
privilege
are
not
easy
to
state.
as
far
as
i
know
rarely
have
ever
been
considered
by
this
court
and
as
far
as
i
know
have
never,
it
has
never
been
suggested
that
they
would
prevent
the
indictment
of
an
executive
aide
for
the
commission
of
a
crime
or
that
they
would
prevent
his
being
subjected
to
inquiry
by
a
grand
jury.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
might
be
some
limitation
on
the
nature
of
the
questions
that
could
be
asked
but
there
is
no
--
i
don't
know
of
basis
upon
which
it
could
be
said
that
he
could
simply
refuse
to
appear
before
a
grand
jury
because
he
was
an
executive.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
is
i
think,
mr.
justice
another
privilege
analogous
to
the
executive
privilege,
not
based
on
article
1,
section
6
but
simply
based
on
the
same
principles
as
those
involved
by
this
--
applied
by
this
court
in
barr
against
matteo
where
you
will
recall
an
employee,
an
executive
employee
having
no
direct
connection
with
the
president
was
held
privileged
from
liability
for
slanderous
remarks
which
he
included
in
a
letter
which
he
wrote
in
good
faith
in
the
course
of
business.
and
i
would
have
no
doubt
that
aides
to
congressmen
and
senators
are
subject
to
the
same
kind
of
privilege
with
respect
to
civil
liability
which
was
involved
in
barr
against
matteo.
i
think
there
may
well
be
limits
as
to
the
extent
to
which
an
aide
can
be
questioned
with
respect
to
--
for
example,
did
you
write
speech,
matters
directly
related
to
speech
or
debate.
i
do
not
know
the
extent
of
those
limits
and
i
don't
think
that
they
are
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
they
would
have
to
be
on
a
common
law
basis
of
some
kind
derived
out
of
--
well
either
common
law
or
derived
out
of
conceptions
of
separation
of
powers
the
limits
of
which
are
far
clear
to
me.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
believe
that
is
involved
in
some
of
these
cases
of
prosecutions
of
congressmen
and
senators
and
this
is
never
been
--
i
hate
to
say,
it's
never
been
suggested,
but
it
is
never
been
held
that
such
evidence
is
not
admissible
in
a
criminal
charge
against
a
congressman
or
senator.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
cannot
be
inquired
with
respect
to
a
charge
against
the
congressman
or
senator.
i
don't
think
that
it
is
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
there
is
no
suggestion
here
that
there
is
any
effort
to
make
a
charge
against
senator
gravel.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
is
perfectly
plain
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
if
there
is
any
effort
to
make
a
charge
against
senator
gravel,
he
has
complete
protection
under
article
1,
section
6.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
even
though
they
get
the
testimony
from
any
place,
senator
gravel
cannot
be
required
to
--
cannot
be
questioned
in
any
other
place
with
respect
to
anything
which
is
fairly
a
speech
or
debate.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
there
may
be
many
other
people
involved
in
this.
this
is
an
effort
through
a
grand
jury
to
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
because
he
is
not
a
congressman
or
a
senator.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice
i
suggest
that
is
a
pure
inference
on
which
there
is
no
basis.
there
are
many
other
people
involved
in
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that's
entirely
up
to
the
senate.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
so
far
as
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
so
far
as
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
is
concerned,
there
is
senator
gravel
is
not
being
required
to
answer
in
any
other
place
with
respect
to
a
speech
or
debate.
he
is
not
himself
subject
to
questions
which
i
think
is
one
aspect
of
the
--
shall
not
be
questioned
in
any
other
place
and
he
is
not
himself
the
subject
of
charges.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice
we
--
i
do.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
motives,
i
don't
know.
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
what
i
think--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice
is
that
there
should
not
be
any
limitation
on
the
inquiry
which
can
be
made
of
dr.
rodberg
or
of
the
representatives
of
the
mit
press
and
the
beacon
press.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice
it
could
be
in
a
wholly
different
case.
the
motive
was
to
get
revenge
against
somebody
else.
having
found
that
the
motive
was
to
get
revenge
against
somebody
else
that
might
lead
to
another
witness
which
would
provide
evidence
as
to
what
was
being
done.
the
motive
may
be
relevant
in
the
process
of
investigating
a
criminal
charge.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
against
somebody
else
and
this
is
a
case
where
it
seems
to
me
and
in
fact
there
is
something
rather
whimsical
about
this
whole
situation.
the
government
is
charged
that
it
should
keep
its
own
house
in
order,
it
should
protect
the
privacy
of
its
papers.
if
the
papers
are
stolen,
they
can
be
credit
and
nothing
can
be
done
about
it.
then
the
government
seeks
to
undertake
a
regular
organized,
centuries
old
proceedings
through
the
grand
jury
and
the
grand
jury
is
made
up
of
citizens
to
inquire
into
the
source
of
what
may
have
been
a
crime.
the
receipt
of
stolen
property,
the
violation
of
undertakings
of
one
kind
or
another.
i
am
not
suggesting
that
senator
gravel
did
this.
i
am
suggesting
that
it
is
entirely
appropriate
to
inquire
into
the
question
whether
any
of
these
offenses
which
congress
has
laid
down
by
law
have
been
committed
and
that
there
is
no
reason
why
dr.
rodberg
or
anyone
else
should
have
a
privilege
to
refuse
to
respond
to
questions
relating
to
those
matters
which
may
lead
to
charges
against
other
persons
than
senator
gravel.
there
might
even
charges
against
dr.
rodberg
or
against
the
other
people.
of
course
dr.
rodberg
has
the
privilege
against
self
incrimination
which
he
can
exercise
any
time
he
thinks
it
is
appropriate.
but
i
know
no
basis
upon
which
it
can
be
said
that
they
cannot
even
be
asked
about
this
because
it
collaterally
relates
to
something
done
by
a
senator
when
there
is
no
suggestion
then
any
charge
can
be
brought
against
the
senator
or
that
he
can
be
required
to
answer
with
respect
to
it
in
any
other
place.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
mr.
justice
we
are
not
able
to
question
the
senator
about
anything
insofar
as
it
relates
to
speech
or
debate.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
am
not
contending
to
the
contrary,
it
is
a
little
tenuous.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice,
yes.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
let
me
take
this
case.
this
is
an
extreme
case,
but
perhaps
to
tests
it.
suppose
there
is
a
close
debate,
a
close
vote
coming
up
in
the
senate.
the
best
estimates
are
that
it
will
be
48,
47,
but
you
can't
be
quite
sure.
and
the
senator
goes
to
his
aide
and
he
says,
you
go
out
and
kidnap
senator
x
and
you
treat
him
kindly
and
take
care
of
him,
but
just
don't
let
him
come
to
the
senate
vote.
now,
this
is
obviously
a
legislative
matter
directly
related
to
a
legislation
and
the
aide
goes
out
conducts
the
detention
of
the
member
whose
vote
is
not
wanted.
now,
it
seems
to
me
inconceivable
that
it
can
be
said
that
the
aide
is
not
subject
to
inquiry
by
a
grand
jury
as
to
what
he
did
and
as
to
why
he
did
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
am
sorry
mr.
justice?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
know
but
i
am
suggesting,
i
am
suggesting
a
criminal
action.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
i
say
i
am
suggesting
a
criminal
action.
i
am
saying
its
a
criminal
action,
but
the
language
makes
no
differentiation
between
criminal
or
any
other
kinds
of
action.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
if
you
would
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice.
no,
i
can't
the
senator,
i
am
sorry.
you
can't
ask
the
senator.
the
senator
cannot
be
questioned
in
any
other
place,
but
you
could
ask
his
aide
where
he
got
the
material.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that's
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
you
could
ask
him
exact
same
question
because
the
privilege
to
speech
and
debate
clause
does
not
protect
anyone
except
senator
and
representatives
and
they
shall
not
be
questioned
in
any
other
place.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i
think
he
would
but
not
under
article
1,
section
6.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
under
some
implication
arising
out
of
the
separation
of
powers
i
would
think
he
would
have
some
kind
of
privilege
there
the
limits
of
which
are
not
clear
to
me
and
which
of
course
i
think
would
vanish
the
moment
there
was
a
charge
of
crime
with
respect
to
and
i
suspect
the
same
would
be
true
with
respect
to
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
even
the
speech
you
debate.
if
for
example
the
question
to
be
put
to
the
aide
is
did
you
deliver
$5000
from
x
corporation
to
the
senator
for
your
speech,
i
think
its
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
would
make
it
crime
of
any
sort.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that's
right.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
is
the
function
of
the
grand
jury
to
inquire
into
crime.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
know
of
any
where
it
has
been
asserted
to
arise
against
a
substantial
charge
of
crime
and
let
me
point
out
that
we
are
not
without
overtones
of
crime
here.
there
may
well
be
receipt
of
stolen
property
and
other
charges
which
it
is
appropriate
for
the
executive
department,
not
merely
appropriate
but
it's
duty
to
inquire
into.
the
speech
of
debate
was
i
suggest
again
has
no
application
to
non
members
by
it's
terms
and
it
has
never
been
applied
to
non-members
by
this
court,
never.
i
think
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
you
can,
but
you
can't
charge
the
senator
or
congressman
to
it
amounts
to
a
great
deal.
the
senator
or
congressman
is
immune
from
either
being
himself
questioned
or
from
being
charged
with
respect
to
his
speech
of
debate.
that's
what
this
court
decided
in
the
johnson
case
and
we
fully
accept
that
and
i
don't
regard
that
as
of
no
consequence.
the
senators
and
representative
are
immune
from
prosecution
with
respect
to
there
speeches
or
debate.
they
are
immune
from
several
liability
with
respect
to
their
speeches
or
debate.
they
can't
even
be
required
to
respond
to
question
with
respect
to
their
speeches
and
debates.
that
is
a
great
and
historic
privilege
which
ought
to
be
maintained,
which
i
fully
support,
but
which
does
not
extend
to
any
other
persons
than
senators
and
representatives.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,mr.
justice
in
powell
and
mccormack,
there
is
a
footnote
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
which
says
that
the
member
is
required
to
answer
and
the
raise
the
privilege.
and
i
should
think
if
i
were
advising
a
congressmen
or
senator
that
i
would
suggest
that
he
get
counsel
and
that
the
proper
representations
be
made
to
the
court.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
if
you
take
the
literal
language
he
could
and
i
suspect
that
if
you
add
a
strong
enough,
clear
enough
case
that
a
congressman
or
a
senator
could
be
successful
in
doing
that,
but
i
wonder
a
little
why
he
would
want
to
when
all
he
has
to
do
is
to
appear
in
the
court
through
counsel
and
do
raise
the
privilege,
citing
the
johnson
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
agree
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
i
have
tried
to
say
there
are
two
ways
in
which
he
can
be
questioned.
one
is
to
sit
on
the
witness
stand
and
be
asked
questions
himself
and
he
can't
do
that.
and
the
other
is
that
he
be
required
to
answer
in
some
way,
with
respect
to
what
he
has
done.
now
the
most
natural
way
for
that,
would
be
by
way
of
indictment
or
a
criminal
charge,
and
article
1,
section
6
protects
him
from
that.
but
it
also
protects
him
against
civil
liability
for
slander
or
anything
else,
and
it
would
protect
him
from
being
required
to
appear
as
a
witness
in
somebody
else's
case
to
testify
as
to
what
he
said
in
a
speech
or
debate.
he
is
himself
protected
in
full
against
being
questioned
in
any
other
place,
but
i
see
no
basis
for
saying
that
any
one
else
is
protected
by
article
1,
section
6.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
you're
protecting,
you're
protecting
a
lot
of
other
people
far
beyond
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
requirement
of
the
constitution
and
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice
and
of
course,
a
congressman,
senator
runs
that
risk
from
the
press
and
from
the
constituents
who
may
have
write
libelous
things
about
him.
as
long
as
senator
gravel
is
not
himself
required
to
answer
in
any
place,
i
think
that
the
privilege
is
fully
vindicated.
i'm
not
making
--
there
is
a
passage
in
jefferson's
manual
which
is
the
great
worth
in
this
area
written
by
the
man
who
one
of
great
founders
of,
he
was
not
at
the
constitutional
convention
and
the
manual
is
the
foundation
of
all
of
the
procedure
in
the
house
and
senate,
this
appears
on
page
24
of
our
brief.
it
was
probably
from
this
view
of
the
encroaching
character
of
privilege
that
the
framers
of
the
constitution
and
they
have
cared
to
provide
that
the
law
shall
bind
equally
on
all
and
especially
that
those
who
make
them
shall
not
exempt
themselves
from
their
operation,
have
only
privilege
senators
and
representatives
themselves
from
the
single
act
of
arrest
in
all
cases,
except
treason,
felony
and
breach
of
the
peace
during
their
attendance
at
the
session
of
their
respective
houses,
and
in
going
to
and
returning
from
the
same
and
from
being
questioned
in
any
other
place
for
any
speech
or
debate
in
the
house.
and
i
would
like
to
suggest,
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
with
surprising
consistency
support
our
position
that
the
speech
or
debate
clause,
provides
no
privilege
to
aides.
perhaps
the
first
case
involving
this
matter
is
kilbourn
against
thompson,
which
was
a
suit
against
the
speaker
of
the
house
and
against
the
sergeant-at-arms
of
the
house,
and
the
house
had
by
vote
decided
that
thompson
was
in
contempt
and
had
ordered
him
to
be
arrested
and
the
speaker
issued
a
warrant
directed
to
the
sergeant-at-arms
to
arrest
thompson.
thompson
got
habeas
corpus
and
he
sued
the
speaker
and
the
sergeant-at-arms
and
this
court
held
that
the
suit
must
be
dismissed
as
to
the
speaker,
he
was
protected
by
the
speech
or
debate
clause
and
it
held
with
the
suit
could
be
maintained
against
thompson.
although
he
was
not
just
a
aide
to
a
congressman
or
a
senator,
but
was
one
of
the
officers
of
the
senate.
he
was
not
protected
by
article
1,
section
6
and
we
know
that
resulted
in
a
judgment
for
$20000
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
and
which
was
eventually
paid
out
of
the
senate's
funds.
and
then
we
have
more
recently,
the
case
of
dombrowski
against
eastland,
which
was
a
suit
against
a
senator
and
against
the
chief
counsel
of
his
committee.
and
the
court
held
that
the
suit
could
not
be
maintained
against
the
senator
at
least
facts
alleged
on
that
case,
but
he
held
that
it
could
be
maintained
against
the
chief
counsel
of
the
committee
and
the
case
went
back
for
a
trial
against
the
chief
counsel.
and
more
recently
we
have
powell
against
mccormack,
which
was
congressman
powell's
suit
against
members
of
the
house
of
representatives,
the
speaker
and
other
members,
and
against
the
doorkeeper
and
other
officers
of
the
house
of
representatives.
and
the
court
held
that
the
speaker
and
the
other
members
could
not
be
sued,
they
were
protected
by
article
1,
section
6
of
the
constitution,
but
it
also
held
that
the
officers
of
the
house
of
representatives
who
were
only
doing
what
they
were
told,
were
subject
to
being
questioned
in
the
courts
and
were
the
basis
for
a
declaratory
judgment
which
this
court
send
the
case
back
to
the
lower
court
to
consider
and
to
enter.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
if
the
sergeant-at-arms
of
the
senate
who
obeys
the
speaker's
warrant
can
be
sued,
if
they
doorkeeper
who
didn't
pay
senator
powell,
congressman
powell
can
be
sued,
i
know
of
no
reason
why
an
aide
is
not
subject
to
the
full
responsibility
of
the
criminal
law.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
if
commits
a
crime,
i
know
of
no
reason
why
he
cannot
be
prosecuted
for
it
and
in
particular,
i
know
of
no
reason
why
he
cannot
be
questioned
about
it,
unless
he
chooses
to
raise
the
fifth
amendment
which
is
available
to
anyone.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
he
was
the
chief
counsel
of
this
subcommittee.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
he
was
the
duly
appointed
long
time
established
and
properly
paid.
the
chief
counsel
of
the
committee
which
was
involved
in
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
sourwine.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
he
was
being
questioned
to
the
extent
of
being
liable
criminally
in
the
courts
of
louisiana
and
civilly
in
the
federal
courts.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
that
i
know
no
any
reason
why
that
rises
higher
than
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
then
the
duty
of
the
executive
to
enforce
law.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes.
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
was
--
we
know
that
there
was
a
recovery
in
kilbourn
and
thompson.
i
have
tried
to
find
out
what
actually
happened
in
dombrowski
and
eastland
and
apparently
it
went
back
to
the
lower
courts
and
was
finally
dismissed
for
want
of
prosecution.
but
i
don't
think
that
effects
the
fact
that
mr.
sourwine
was
held
to
liable
if
it
had
been
pressed
and
that
he
would
have
been
required
to
answer.
after
all
what's
involves
here,
is
an
effort
to
inquire
into
the
question
whether
the
crime
has
been
committed.
if
a
crime
has
been
committed
by
a
aide
or
by
a
third
person
and
it
may
well
not
be
as
a
result
of
the
investigation
that
it
will
be
concluded
that
the
aide
committed
any
crime.
it
may
well
be
that
his
evidence
will
lead
to
someone
else
who
may
have
committed
a
crime
and
that
there
may
be
appropriate
basis
for
bringing
charges
against
some
third
person.
and
i
repeat,
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
speech
or
debate
clause
or
in
any
decision
of
this
court
which
prevents
the
inquiry
of
aides
or
third
persons
as
to
whether
a
crime
has
been
committed.
if
there
is
evidence
that
a
senator
has
committed
a
crime
not
connected
with
speech
or
debate,
he
can
be
prosecuted.
it
was
so
decided
in
the
johnson
case
and
decided
here
in
the
johnson
case
because
the
court
made
it
plain
that
the
case
should
go
back
and
that
senator
johnson
could
be
tried
for
a
crime
committed
while
he
was
congressman.
if
there
is
evidence
that
a
senator
has
committed
a
crime
which
is
adequately
connected
with
speech
or
debate,
he
cannot
be
prosecuted,
he
can
only
be
subject
to
the
discipline
of
the
senator.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
that's
why
i
(voice
overlap)mr.
justice
which
is
adequately
connected
with
speech
or
debate.
i
don't
know
what
the
limits
are.
i
think
they
ought
to
be
rather
broad.
if
--
suppose
a
senator
by
his
own
hands
goes
out
and
steals
a
material
which
he
when
uses
in
a
speech
or
debate,
i
don't
know
whether
he
would
be
exempt
from
prosecution
for
the
theft.
it
is
my
position
that
if
he
directs
his
aide
to
go
out
and
steal
material
for
use
in
the
speech
or
debate
that
the
aide
is
subject
to
prosecution,
that
the
aide
has
no
privilege
under
the
section
--
article
1,
section
6
and
that
the
senator
cannot
extend
an
umbrella
over
him
because
the
senator
has
a
privilege.
with
respect
to
the
senator
we
make
no
other
contention
that
he
can
be
subject
only
to
the
discipline
of
the
senate
with
respect
to
a
matter
which
is
adequately
connected
with
speech
or
debate,
but
there
is
a
nothing
in
the
speech
or
debate
clause
which
protects
either
an
aide
or
a
third
person
from
prosecution
for
any
crime
he
may
have
committed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
he
could
be?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
i
suggest
--
no
i
don't
say
there
is
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
decision
however
is
that
mr.
dombrowski
can
be
sued.
i
agree
there
is
no
decision
there
as
to
the
extent
to
which
he
can
be
questioned
but
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
as
far
as
i
know
this
is
the
first
time
that
you
actually
had
that
question.
as
i
was
saying,
we
think
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
speech
or
debate
clause
which
protects
either
an
aide
or
an
third
person
from
prosecution
for
any
crime
he
may
have
committed.
as
i
have
already
said
an
aide
or
a
third
person
is
entitled
to
the
privilege
against
self
incrimination,
but
such
a
person,
a
non
member
is
not
entitled
to
any
privilege
under
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
tenney
against
brandhove
involved
a
committee
of
the
california
legislation.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
know
that
it
is
a
constitutional
basis
mr.
justice.
i
think
that
analytically
it
is
a
construction
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1871,
under
which
the
suit
was
brought
and
it
was
held
that
the
held
civil
rights
act
should
not
be
construed
to
provide
for
a
liability
of
a
member
of
a
state
legislature.
now,
i
have
no
doubt
that
in
the
background
to
that
question
of
construction
were
some
constitutional
considerations,
derived
out
of
no
particular
clause
of
any
constitution
but
derived
it
seems
to
me
i
can
say
out
of
constitutional
history.
the
state
legislatures
just
like
congress
are
the
lineal
decedents
of
the
british
parliament.
there
were
centuries
of
controversy
and
the
struggle
between
parliament
and
the
crown
with
respect
to
the
privileges
of
the
two
houses.
at
various
times,
particularly
the
18th
century,
the
privileges
got
really
out
of
hand.
the
history
shows
that
members
sold
the
right
to
be
a
servant
of
a
member
in
order
that
the
servant
would
not
be
subject
to
suit
in
civil
cases.
that
was
abolishment
to
before
1789.
that
history
i
think
is
part
of
the
reason
why
the
privilege
was
limited
to
senators
and
representatives,
but
in
the
--
tenney
case
the
decision
was,
that
they
could
not
be
subjected
to
civil
liability
and
let
me
point
out
again
that
this
is
a
suit
against
amendments,
not
against
anybody
else.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
was
plainly
not
under
the
speech
and
debate
clause.
i
recognize
that,
nor
does
it
purport
to
be
an
interpretation
of
the
california
constitution.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
i
think
you
will
find
and
i
read
it
as
carefully
as
i
could
with
just
this
in
mind
i
think
you
will
find
that
it
really
boils
down
to
being
a
construction
in
the
broad
sense
not
of
any
particular
language,
a
construction
of
the
civil
rights
act,
on
which
the
suit
was
based
and
to
hold
that
congress
in
passing
that
statute
could
not
have
intended
that
it
provide
for
suits
against
members
of
state
legislatures
for
doing
what
they
regarded
as
their
legislative
duty.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
am
on
the
first
place
mr.
justice
i
doubt
if
it
corresponds
with
the
facts.
i
expect
that
many
members
of
congress
had
i
recall
john
quincy
adams
went
to
russia
with
his
father
john
adams.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
staff
were
not
as
elaborate
as
they
are
now
and
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice
i
think
you
can,
because
of
this
history
about
the
extension
of
the
privilege
far
beyond
members
in
parliament
which
came
to
be
recognize
as
a
great
abuse
and
was
completely
eliminated
by
parliament
and
then
the
colonies,
shorty
before
1789
and
i
doubt
very
much
that
the
distinguished
gentlemen
of
the
first
congress
operated
entirely
on
their
own.
it's
perfectly
plain
they
didn't
have
as
many
constituents
as
present
members
have,
they
didn't
have
electronic
and
other
aids
available.
they
didn't
have
a
volume
material
pouring
in
on
them
with
which
they
had
to
deal.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
think
primarily
mr.
justice
nevertheless
the
history
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
the
history
of
the
speech
and
debate
clause
is
to
protect
the
members
not
entirely
but
it
large
they
were
the
members
who
were
being
arrested
and
put
in
the
tower
and
senator
ervin
talked
about
congressman,
the
senators
being
intimidated.
now
perhaps
one
reason
you
want
to
protect
congressman
and
senators
from
being
intimidated
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice,
but
i
don't
think
that
it
follows
that
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
if
you
are
guided
only
by
that
purpose,
you
would
of
course
give
a
very
squeaking
application,
i
can't
say
construction,
a
very
squeaking
application
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause,
you
would
ignore
in
either
house,
you
would
ignore
the
senators
or
representatives,
i
don't
know
what
else
that
you
would
ignore,
but
i
find
no
basis
for
that.
i
think
the
public
can
be
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
that
the
purpose
can
be
adequately
maintained
by
guiding
absolutely
against
the
senator
or
representative
being
questioned
in
any
other
place
with
respect
to
any
speech
or
debate.
and
i
know
of
nothing
in
our
history
to
indicate
that
congressman
and
senators
have
not
been
fearless
or
that
they
have
been
restrained
in
their
action
because
they
think
that
the
executive
branch
and
the
judicial
branch
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
mr.
justice
i
think
that
is
putting
it
in
an
unreal
and
if
i
may
say
so
in
inappropriate
way.
i
don't
know
how
many
aides
there
are
of
congressman
and
senators.
there
are
535
congressman
and
senators.
if
they
average
20
each
which
is
probably
low,
that
would
be
ten
thousand
people
who
would
be
entitled
to
all
of
these
immunities.
i
suspect
that
it's
more
than
--
i
suspect
that
is
closer
to
twenty
or
thirty
thousand
people
when
you
include
secretaries
and
other
persons.
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
think
that
either
the
founders
intended
or
that
it
can
fairly
be
found
within
that
quite
precise
language
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause
that
there
was
to
be
a
large
mass
of
people
not
merely
in
the
capital,
but
all
over
the
country
because
many
of
these
aides
are
back
in
the
home
districts
who
are
protected
against
being
questioned
in
any
place.
the
way
it
is
asserted
that
dr.
rodberg
and
these
outsiders
should
be
protected
here.
as
i
have
said
no
case,
and
i
repeat,
no
case
has
ever
given
such
a
privilege
to
an
aide.
moreover
the
privilege
applies
only
to
speech
or
debate
in
either
house
and
many
of
the
questions
which
might
be
asked
here
relate
to
matters
far
outside
of
either
house.
senator
ervin
referred
yesterday
to
the
massachusetts,
the
early
massachusetts
case
of
coffin
against
coffin.
it
is
rather
fun
to
read
that
case
as
you
might
guess
from
the
name
it
arouse
out
of
nantucket.
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
whether
the
two
parties
were
brothers
or
otherwise
related,
they
may
not
have
been.
it
involved
action
on
the
floor
of
the
house
of
representatives
in
massachusetts,
in
boston
where
there
had
been
a
hope
with
respect
to
establishing
a
new
office
of
notary
public
in
nantucket
and
question
was
raised
as
to
who
would
be
named
for
the
office.
the
house
voted
to
establish
the
new
office
which
was
undoubtedly
a
legislative
business
and
then
it
developed
that
while
other
legislative
matter
was
going
on
and
still
on
the
floor
of
the
house,
but
had
an
area
aside
over
beside
the
speaker's
bench,
the
one
representative
came
to
mr.
coffin
and
said,
that
they
were
going
to
name
another
mr.
coffin
and
this
mr.
coffin
said,
what
that
criminal?
and
don't
you
know
that
he
was
involved
in
that
bank
robbery
down
there.
now
it
is
perfectly
true
that
coffin
against
coffin
is
regarded
and
rightly
regarded
as
one
of
the
leading
cases
in
this
area.
again
it
is
written
by
theosophical
persons,
the
then
chief
justice,
all
the
other
judges
were
well
known
massachusetts
figures.
there
is
a
long
discussion
of
speech
or
debate,
but
the
result
of
the
case
is
that
mr.
coffin
was
held
liable
for
a
judgment
of
the
$2500
which
in
1804
was
no
inconsiderable
amount.
because
the
court
held
that
this
matter
happening
on
the
floor
of
the
house
but
to
decide
and
after
the
vote
had
actually
been
taken
did
not
relate
to
a
speech
or
debate
in
either
house.
the
case
is
of
course
of
great
historical
significance,
but
its
decision
i
think
is
on
the
side
which
we
advance
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
mr.
chief
justice
that's
a
nice
question.
i
am
just
running
through
my
mind
the
arguments
on
both
side.
perhaps
some
day
this
court
will
have
to
answer
it.
i
don't
myself
feel
qualified
at
this
time
to
answer
it.
certainly,
the
congress
should
have
great
power
to
legislate
with
respect
to
its
own
activities,
not
merely
power
to
protect,
but
i
think
also
power
to
put
out,
that
is
power
to
say
the
contempts
of
congress
shall
be
tried
in
the
courts
as
has
been
the
practice
for
a
long
time.
i
think
without
meaning
to
argue
another
case
that
congress
can
provide
that
crimes
committed
by
congressman
can
be
tried
in
the
courts.
so,
i
think
that
quite
an
argument
can
be
made
that
not
because
of
any
express
power,
but
something
arising
out
of
what
chief
justice
marshall
said
it
is
a
constitution
we
are
expounding.
that
if
congress
did
that
in
sufficiently
limited
terms
it
probably
would
be
done.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but,
it
is
not
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
and
i
think
congressman.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
congress
might
spell
that
out
in
more
detail.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
and
i
suspect
that
congress
at
least
in
the
federal
courts,
i
don't
know
whether
congress
could
enact
it
with
respect
to
evidence
in
the
state
courts.
now
there
is
one
final
point
here
to
which
very
little
reference
has
been
made.
we
have
not
only
aides
but
we
have
third
parties.
here
representatives
of
the
m.
i.
t.
press
and
the
beacon
press,
and
i
would
say
that
a
fortiori
they
have
no
privilege
not
to
testify.
it
maybe
that
their
testimony
cannot
be
used
against
the
senator
but
it
can
be
used
against
them
and
it
can
be
use
against
other
non-members.
only
a
senator
or
a
representative
is
protected
by
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
and
in
particular,
the
speech
or
debate
clause
has
nothing
to
do
with
republication.
in
the
first
place,
i
don't
want
to
concede
that
we
are
really
dealing
with
republication
here
because
as
i
understand
the
situation
that
most
of
the
47
volumes
of
the
pentagon
papers
were
not
read
by
senator
gravel,
after
all
it's
seven
million
words.
he
read
some
of
them
and
he
then
introduced
the
others
into
the
record.
they
were
never
published
as
a
part
of
the
record.
indeed,
what's
involved
here
is
senator
gravel's
effort
to
get
them
published
and
they
were
published
by
the
beacon
press.
what
i
suggest
to
you
that
that
may
well
not
be
a
republication,
but
maybe
not
protected
as
the
republication
of
material
which
has
been
published
as
a
part
of
a
congressional
activity.
in
an
event,
the
speech
or
debate
clause
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
a
private
publication
by
senator
gravel
which
is
not
a
publication
of
the
congressional
materials.
here
the
chairman
of
the
committee
refused
to
authorize
the
expenditure,
the
funds
for
the
reporter
and
they
have
not
been
published
by
the
congress
and
senator
gravel
has
caused
them
to
be
published
elsewhere
which
i
suggest
is
not
privilege
under
any
conception
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
know
how
much
was
in
the
--
as
far
as
i
know
none
is
in
the
congressional
record.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
how
much
of
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
all
of
those
four
volumes
i
believe,
as
far
as,
i
know
the
four
volumes
have
never
been
published.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
were
47
volumes.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
i
understand
that
43
of
them
published,
most
of
the
43
of
them
published
by
defense
department.
and
let
me
finally
close
by
saying
that
there
is
no
first
amendment
question,
here.
no
one
is
trying
to
stop
publication,
it's
been
done,
the
material
has
been
published.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
were
prior
efforts
to
try
to
stop
it
but
as
far
as
beacon
press
is
concerned,
it
has
published
it
and
the
majority
of
the
court
in
the
new
york
times
case,
made
it
quite
plain
though
there
could
be
publication,
the
consequences
of
that
publication
remain
for
consideration,
and
they
might
be
criminal
and
they
might
be
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
was,
that
was
left
open
and
that
mr.
justice,
is
what
we
are
trying
to
explore
here
to
see
whether
there
was
any
crime
committed
in
connection
with
the
publication
of
these
materials,
and
we
are
trying
to
obtain
evidence
on
that
subject
and
i
repeat,
i
do
not
see
that
the
first
amendment
is
involve
in
anyway
because
the
material
has
been
published,
the
speech
has
been
made,
the
presses
have
rolled,
the
situation
now
is
what
are
the
consequences
of
that
and
we
believe
that
we
are
entitled
with
the
evidence
of
these
persons
who
have
been
subpoenaed
in
this
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
first
in
supplementing
the
response
to
mr.
justice
blackmun's
question,
i
think
it
may
be
said
that,
dr.
rodberg
is
the
physicist.
in
my
view
this
case
does
not
involve
any
fair
application
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
the
case
has
now
been
argued
before
the
court
for
nearly
an
hour
and
no
one
has
yet
referred
to
the
text
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
it
appears
at
the
bottom
of
page
2
and
the
top
of
page
3,
of
the
government's
principal
brief
here.
of
course,
i
know
it
is
familiar
to
the
court,
although
it
has
been
involved
in
a
surprisingly
small
number
of
decisions
of
this
court.
but
it
seems
to
me,
relevant
and
appropriate,
that
before
proceeding
further
with
this
case,
we
get
back
to
the
bedrock.
what
does
the
constitution
say?
the
senators
and
representatives,
nobody
else,
the
senators
and
representatives
shall
receive
compensation
and
they
shall
in
all
cases,
except
treason,
felony
and
breach
of
the
peace,
which
covers
almost
everything,
be
privileged
from
arrest
during
their
attendance
at
the
session
of
their
respective
houses,
no
effort
to
give
a
sweeping
immunity
to
congressman
or
senators,
and
in
going
to
and
returning
from
the
same,
and
for
any
speech
or
debate
in
either
house,
they
shall
not
be
questioned
in
any
other
place.
now
there
are
three
groups
of
words
of
limitation
in
that
provision.
the
senators
and
representatives,
not
the
senators
and
representatives
and
those
associated
with
him
and
those
who
assist
him
and
members
of
their
family
and
staff
and
servants
as
it
used
to
be
in
england,
and
which
they
we're
trying
to
get
away
from,
and
speech
or
debate.
now
speech
or
debate
is
not
everything
they
say,
everything
they
do,
and
finally
in
either
house.
it
is
suggested
that
our
argument
here,
and
i
must
confess
i
have
a
little
feeling
like,
arguing
that
no
law
means
no
law,
but
it
is
suggested
that,
our
reference
to
stylistic
precision
which
is
the
phrase
we
use
in
our
brief.
this
is
a
case
where
it
seems
to
me,
that
the
language
was
very
carefully
written
and
very
carefully
intended.
it
is
suggested
that,
this
is
simply
the
language
of
the
committee
on
style.
they
didn't
mean
any
such
limitations
and
that
that
there
is
evidence
by
the
language
which
had
been
used
by
the
committee
on
detail,
which
was
the
only
place
in
the
convention
where
the
matter
was
considered.
there
surprisingly
there
is
very
little
available
in
the
history
of
the
convention,
but
let's
look
at
the
language
which
had
been
used
by
the
committee
on
detail.
this
appears
at
the
bottom
of
page
92
of
the
big
red
brief,
senator
gravel's
main
brief.
now
the
committee
on
detail
and
which
is
what
the
convention
voted
for
wrote,
freedom
of
speech
and
debate
in
the
legislature.
well
now
who
engages
in
speech
or
debate
in
the
legislature,
no
one
but
senators
and
representatives.
freedom
of
speech
and
debate
in
the
legislature
shall
not
be
impeached
or
questioned
in
any
court
or
place,
out
of
the
legislature.
and
i
would
suggest
that
there
is
no
significant
difference
in
meaning,
between
the
phraseology
of
the
committee
on
detail
and
that
of
the
committee
on
style.
the
committee
on
style
did
make
it
a
little
more
elegant,
but
it
did
not
limit
it
beyond
what
had
been
adopted
before.
now
the
significant
fact
in
this
case
with
respect
to
this
language,
is
that
the
senator
gravel
is
not
being
questioned
by
anybody
in
any
place.
the
constitution
and
the
privilege
granted
by
the
constitution
to
senators
and
representatives
is
being
fully
compelled
with.
there
is
an
analysis
of
this
clause,
which
as
far
as
i
know
does
not
appear
as
yet
in
any
of
the
opinions
of
this
court,
but
which
i
think
clarifies
it's
meaning
and
application,
and
on
the
basis
of
which
the
privilege
itself,
and
the
several
cases
which
have
been
decided
about
it
fall
very
well
in
the
place.
questioned,
is
the
keyword
at
the
end
of
this
constitutional
provision,
and
questioned
may
be
read
in
two
senses.
first,
as
i
have
just
indicated
with
respect
to
questioning
senator
gravel.
perfectly
clear
that
senator
gravel
cannot
be
questioned
about
any
speech
or
debate
which
he
has
made.
it's
not
necessary
here
to
determine
the
limits
of
speech
or
debate,
because
senator
gravel
is
not
being
questioned.
no
subpoena
has
been
issued
against
senator
gravel.
there
is
no
suggestion
that
he
is
being
questioned,
but
the
word
question
can
also
be
read
in
another
sense,
that
is
of
being
subject
to
charges
in
which
reliance
is
put
on
evidence
of
speeches
or
debates
by
the
member.
but
senator
gravel
is
not
being
questioned
in
this
sense.
he
has
not
been
charged
with
anything.
he
is
not
on
trial,
there
is
not
a
question
of
the
use
of
evidence
of
other
persons
with
respect
to
a
speech
or
debate
being
directed
against
him.
he
has
not
been
indicted,
he
has
not
been
summoned,
he
is
not
subject
to
charges,
and
i
would
suggest
that
when
those
conditions
exists,
the
speech
or
debate
clause
is
fully
satisfied.
this
case
is
not
like
the
johnson
case,
in
this
court.
the
johnson
case
was
an
indictment
of
a
congressman,
based
upon
facts
arising
out
of
a
speech
which
he
had
made
in
the
house
of
representatives.
and
the
court
held
that
evidence
with
respect
to
that
speech
could
not
be
introduced
in
the
trial
against
johnson
without
violating
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
it
was
not
merely
that
he
could
not
be
someone
than
required
to
testify,
but
he
could
not
be
required
to
answer
a
charge
based
upon
the
speech
which
he
had
given.
that
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
senator
gravel
had
not
been
summoned
and
required
to
testify.
he
is
not
required
to
answer
a
charge
based
upon
the
speech,
but
this
case
is
like
the
johnson
case
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
before
it
got
here.
you
will
recall
that
there
were
two
congressman
who
were
indicted,
and
two
private
individuals,
and
they
were
all
indicted
for
conspiracy,
and
for
engaging
in
certain
acts
or
in
aiding
or
abetting
those
acts.
and
it
is
true
that
the
court
referred
on
page
176,
in
the
johnson
opinion
to
the
fact
that,
the
constitutional
infirmity
infecting
this
prosecution
is
not
merely
a
matter
of
the
introduction
of
inadmissible
evidence
and
senator
gravel
in
his
brief
says
that
that's
a
decision
that
this
evidence
is
inadmissible,
and
therefore
can't
be
acquired.
well,
we
agree
that
it
is
inadmissible
against
senator
gravel,
if
there
ever
should
be
any
sort
of
a
charge
against
senator
gravel.
but
the
johnson
case
in
the
fourth
circuit,
involved
two
persons
who
were
not
congressmen
and
their
convictions
were
sustained
in
the
variable
opinion
of
chief
judge
soboloff.
i've
read
it
again
a
few
days
ago,
and
it
is
a
remarkably
fine
opinion
and
this
is
the
language
which
is
used
with
respect
to
them
at
page
193
of
337
f2nd.
count
one
of
the
indictment
is
unconstitutional,
as
applied
to
defendant
johnson,
but
as
none
of
the
privileges
of
article
1,
section
6,
pertain
to
the
defendants
who
are
not
members
of
congress,
their
attack
on
the
first
count
unlike
jonson's
is
not
sustained.
now
it
is
true
that
that
this
court
did
not
review
that
decision,
and
expressly
left
open
its
propriety
and
the
decision
in
the
johnson
case
itself
which
involved
only
congressman
johnson,
but
i
submit
that
the
decision
reached
by
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
chief
judge
siboloff's
opinion
is
a
sound
construction.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
involved
both
the
conspiracy
to
give
and
accept
--
well,
it
involved
both
the
conspiracy
and
the
substantive
offense.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
were
five
or
six
accounts
of
the
substantive
offense
of
--
as
i
record
mr.
justice
,
conflict
of
interest
rather
than
of
bribing
(voice
overlap)
and
appearing
before
the
executive
branch
of
the
government.
as
you
will
recall,
the
case
went
back
to
the
trial
court.
congressman
johnson
was
convicted
without
the
use
of
the
evidence
of
the
speech.
that
conviction
was
affirmed
by
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
this
court
denied
certiorari.
it
is
also
true
that
the
two
other
persons
in
the
johnson
case
were
not
aides.
they
were
private
citizens,
although
they
were
actually
aiding
congressman
johnson
and
i
suppose
he
could
have
put
his
finger
down,
somebody
and
said
you're
now
my
aides
and
since
no
payroll
provision
was
involved,
they
could
have
been
the
same,
but
there
is
no
suggestion
that
they
were
nevertheless,
i
repeat
my
suggestion
for
the
court's
consideration
that
article
1,
section
6
does
not
provide
any
protection
to
anyone
except
senators
and
representatives.
it
does
not
provide
any
protection
to
aides.
i
know
of
no
decision
of
this
court
which
has
held
that
aides
or
third
persons
are
entitled
to
any
benefits
under
the
speech
and
debates
clause.
perfectly
plain
that
congressmen
and
senators
are
entitled
to
great
benefits
under
the
speech
and
debate
clause
and
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
which
in
any
way
impairs
the
privilege
which
is
given
to
senator
gravel
by
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
he
is
not
being
subject
to
question
himself.
he
is
not
being
required
to
answer
to
charges
based
upon
evidence
relating
to
a
speech
or
debate.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
in
the
first
place
the
limits
of
the
executive
privilege
are
not
easy
to
state.
as
far
as
i
know
rarely
have
ever
been
considered
by
this
court
and
as
far
as
i
know
have
never,
it
has
never
been
suggested
that
they
would
prevent
the
indictment
of
an
executive
aide
for
the
commission
of
a
crime
or
that
they
would
prevent
his
being
subjected
to
inquiry
by
a
grand
jury.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
might
be
some
limitation
on
the
nature
of
the
questions
that
could
be
asked
but
there
is
no
--
i
don't
know
of
basis
upon
which
it
could
be
said
that
he
could
simply
refuse
to
appear
before
a
grand
jury
because
he
was
an
executive.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
is
i
think,
mr.
justice
another
privilege
analogous
to
the
executive
privilege,
not
based
on
article
1,
section
6
but
simply
based
on
the
same
principles
as
those
involved
by
this
--
applied
by
this
court
in
barr
against
matteo
where
you
will
recall
an
employee,
an
executive
employee
having
no
direct
connection
with
the
president
was
held
privileged
from
liability
for
slanderous
remarks
which
he
included
in
a
letter
which
he
wrote
in
good
faith
in
the
course
of
business.
and
i
would
have
no
doubt
that
aides
to
congressmen
and
senators
are
subject
to
the
same
kind
of
privilege
with
respect
to
civil
liability
which
was
involved
in
barr
against
matteo.
i
think
there
may
well
be
limits
as
to
the
extent
to
which
an
aide
can
be
questioned
with
respect
to
--
for
example,
did
you
write
speech,
matters
directly
related
to
speech
or
debate.
i
do
not
know
the
extent
of
those
limits
and
i
don't
think
that
they
are
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
they
would
have
to
be
on
a
common
law
basis
of
some
kind
derived
out
of
--
well
either
common
law
or
derived
out
of
conceptions
of
separation
of
powers
the
limits
of
which
are
far
clear
to
me.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
believe
that
is
involved
in
some
of
these
cases
of
prosecutions
of
congressmen
and
senators
and
this
is
never
been
--
i
hate
to
say,
it's
never
been
suggested,
but
it
is
never
been
held
that
such
evidence
is
not
admissible
in
a
criminal
charge
against
a
congressman
or
senator.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
cannot
be
inquired
with
respect
to
a
charge
against
the
congressman
or
senator.
i
don't
think
that
it
is
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
there
is
no
suggestion
here
that
there
is
any
effort
to
make
a
charge
against
senator
gravel.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
is
perfectly
plain
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
if
there
is
any
effort
to
make
a
charge
against
senator
gravel,
he
has
complete
protection
under
article
1,
section
6.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
even
though
they
get
the
testimony
from
any
place,
senator
gravel
cannot
be
required
to
--
cannot
be
questioned
in
any
other
place
with
respect
to
anything
which
is
fairly
a
speech
or
debate.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
there
may
be
many
other
people
involved
in
this.
this
is
an
effort
through
a
grand
jury
to
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
because
he
is
not
a
congressman
or
a
senator.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice
i
suggest
that
is
a
pure
inference
on
which
there
is
no
basis.
there
are
many
other
people
involved
in
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that's
entirely
up
to
the
senate.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
so
far
as
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
so
far
as
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
is
concerned,
there
is
senator
gravel
is
not
being
required
to
answer
in
any
other
place
with
respect
to
a
speech
or
debate.
he
is
not
himself
subject
to
questions
which
i
think
is
one
aspect
of
the
--
shall
not
be
questioned
in
any
other
place
and
he
is
not
himself
the
subject
of
charges.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice
we
--
i
do.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
motives,
i
don't
know.
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
what
i
think--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice
is
that
there
should
not
be
any
limitation
on
the
inquiry
which
can
be
made
of
dr.
rodberg
or
of
the
representatives
of
the
mit
press
and
the
beacon
press.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice
it
could
be
in
a
wholly
different
case.
the
motive
was
to
get
revenge
against
somebody
else.
having
found
that
the
motive
was
to
get
revenge
against
somebody
else
that
might
lead
to
another
witness
which
would
provide
evidence
as
to
what
was
being
done.
the
motive
may
be
relevant
in
the
process
of
investigating
a
criminal
charge.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
against
somebody
else
and
this
is
a
case
where
it
seems
to
me
and
in
fact
there
is
something
rather
whimsical
about
this
whole
situation.
the
government
is
charged
that
it
should
keep
its
own
house
in
order,
it
should
protect
the
privacy
of
its
papers.
if
the
papers
are
stolen,
they
can
be
credit
and
nothing
can
be
done
about
it.
then
the
government
seeks
to
undertake
a
regular
organized,
centuries
old
proceedings
through
the
grand
jury
and
the
grand
jury
is
made
up
of
citizens
to
inquire
into
the
source
of
what
may
have
been
a
crime.
the
receipt
of
stolen
property,
the
violation
of
undertakings
of
one
kind
or
another.
i
am
not
suggesting
that
senator
gravel
did
this.
i
am
suggesting
that
it
is
entirely
appropriate
to
inquire
into
the
question
whether
any
of
these
offenses
which
congress
has
laid
down
by
law
have
been
committed
and
that
there
is
no
reason
why
dr.
rodberg
or
anyone
else
should
have
a
privilege
to
refuse
to
respond
to
questions
relating
to
those
matters
which
may
lead
to
charges
against
other
persons
than
senator
gravel.
there
might
even
charges
against
dr.
rodberg
or
against
the
other
people.
of
course
dr.
rodberg
has
the
privilege
against
self
incrimination
which
he
can
exercise
any
time
he
thinks
it
is
appropriate.
but
i
know
no
basis
upon
which
it
can
be
said
that
they
cannot
even
be
asked
about
this
because
it
collaterally
relates
to
something
done
by
a
senator
when
there
is
no
suggestion
then
any
charge
can
be
brought
against
the
senator
or
that
he
can
be
required
to
answer
with
respect
to
it
in
any
other
place.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
mr.
justice
we
are
not
able
to
question
the
senator
about
anything
insofar
as
it
relates
to
speech
or
debate.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
am
not
contending
to
the
contrary,
it
is
a
little
tenuous.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice,
yes.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
let
me
take
this
case.
this
is
an
extreme
case,
but
perhaps
to
tests
it.
suppose
there
is
a
close
debate,
a
close
vote
coming
up
in
the
senate.
the
best
estimates
are
that
it
will
be
48,
47,
but
you
can't
be
quite
sure.
and
the
senator
goes
to
his
aide
and
he
says,
you
go
out
and
kidnap
senator
x
and
you
treat
him
kindly
and
take
care
of
him,
but
just
don't
let
him
come
to
the
senate
vote.
now,
this
is
obviously
a
legislative
matter
directly
related
to
a
legislation
and
the
aide
goes
out
conducts
the
detention
of
the
member
whose
vote
is
not
wanted.
now,
it
seems
to
me
inconceivable
that
it
can
be
said
that
the
aide
is
not
subject
to
inquiry
by
a
grand
jury
as
to
what
he
did
and
as
to
why
he
did
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
am
sorry
mr.
justice?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
know
but
i
am
suggesting,
i
am
suggesting
a
criminal
action.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
i
say
i
am
suggesting
a
criminal
action.
i
am
saying
its
a
criminal
action,
but
the
language
makes
no
differentiation
between
criminal
or
any
other
kinds
of
action.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
if
you
would
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice.
no,
i
can't
the
senator,
i
am
sorry.
you
can't
ask
the
senator.
the
senator
cannot
be
questioned
in
any
other
place,
but
you
could
ask
his
aide
where
he
got
the
material.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that's
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
you
could
ask
him
exact
same
question
because
the
privilege
to
speech
and
debate
clause
does
not
protect
anyone
except
senator
and
representatives
and
they
shall
not
be
questioned
in
any
other
place.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i
think
he
would
but
not
under
article
1,
section
6.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
under
some
implication
arising
out
of
the
separation
of
powers
i
would
think
he
would
have
some
kind
of
privilege
there
the
limits
of
which
are
not
clear
to
me
and
which
of
course
i
think
would
vanish
the
moment
there
was
a
charge
of
crime
with
respect
to
and
i
suspect
the
same
would
be
true
with
respect
to
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
even
the
speech
you
debate.
if
for
example
the
question
to
be
put
to
the
aide
is
did
you
deliver
$5000
from
x
corporation
to
the
senator
for
your
speech,
i
think
its
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
would
make
it
crime
of
any
sort.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that's
right.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
is
the
function
of
the
grand
jury
to
inquire
into
crime.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
know
of
any
where
it
has
been
asserted
to
arise
against
a
substantial
charge
of
crime
and
let
me
point
out
that
we
are
not
without
overtones
of
crime
here.
there
may
well
be
receipt
of
stolen
property
and
other
charges
which
it
is
appropriate
for
the
executive
department,
not
merely
appropriate
but
it's
duty
to
inquire
into.
the
speech
of
debate
was
i
suggest
again
has
no
application
to
non
members
by
it's
terms
and
it
has
never
been
applied
to
non-members
by
this
court,
never.
i
think
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
you
can,
but
you
can't
charge
the
senator
or
congressman
to
it
amounts
to
a
great
deal.
the
senator
or
congressman
is
immune
from
either
being
himself
questioned
or
from
being
charged
with
respect
to
his
speech
of
debate.
that's
what
this
court
decided
in
the
johnson
case
and
we
fully
accept
that
and
i
don't
regard
that
as
of
no
consequence.
the
senators
and
representative
are
immune
from
prosecution
with
respect
to
there
speeches
or
debate.
they
are
immune
from
several
liability
with
respect
to
their
speeches
or
debate.
they
can't
even
be
required
to
respond
to
question
with
respect
to
their
speeches
and
debates.
that
is
a
great
and
historic
privilege
which
ought
to
be
maintained,
which
i
fully
support,
but
which
does
not
extend
to
any
other
persons
than
senators
and
representatives.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,mr.
justice
in
powell
and
mccormack,
there
is
a
footnote
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
which
says
that
the
member
is
required
to
answer
and
the
raise
the
privilege.
and
i
should
think
if
i
were
advising
a
congressmen
or
senator
that
i
would
suggest
that
he
get
counsel
and
that
the
proper
representations
be
made
to
the
court.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
if
you
take
the
literal
language
he
could
and
i
suspect
that
if
you
add
a
strong
enough,
clear
enough
case
that
a
congressman
or
a
senator
could
be
successful
in
doing
that,
but
i
wonder
a
little
why
he
would
want
to
when
all
he
has
to
do
is
to
appear
in
the
court
through
counsel
and
do
raise
the
privilege,
citing
the
johnson
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
agree
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
i
have
tried
to
say
there
are
two
ways
in
which
he
can
be
questioned.
one
is
to
sit
on
the
witness
stand
and
be
asked
questions
himself
and
he
can't
do
that.
and
the
other
is
that
he
be
required
to
answer
in
some
way,
with
respect
to
what
he
has
done.
now
the
most
natural
way
for
that,
would
be
by
way
of
indictment
or
a
criminal
charge,
and
article
1,
section
6
protects
him
from
that.
but
it
also
protects
him
against
civil
liability
for
slander
or
anything
else,
and
it
would
protect
him
from
being
required
to
appear
as
a
witness
in
somebody
else's
case
to
testify
as
to
what
he
said
in
a
speech
or
debate.
he
is
himself
protected
in
full
against
being
questioned
in
any
other
place,
but
i
see
no
basis
for
saying
that
any
one
else
is
protected
by
article
1,
section
6.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
you're
protecting,
you're
protecting
a
lot
of
other
people
far
beyond
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
requirement
of
the
constitution
and
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice
and
of
course,
a
congressman,
senator
runs
that
risk
from
the
press
and
from
the
constituents
who
may
have
write
libelous
things
about
him.
as
long
as
senator
gravel
is
not
himself
required
to
answer
in
any
place,
i
think
that
the
privilege
is
fully
vindicated.
i'm
not
making
--
there
is
a
passage
in
jefferson's
manual
which
is
the
great
worth
in
this
area
written
by
the
man
who
one
of
great
founders
of,
he
was
not
at
the
constitutional
convention
and
the
manual
is
the
foundation
of
all
of
the
procedure
in
the
house
and
senate,
this
appears
on
page
24
of
our
brief.
it
was
probably
from
this
view
of
the
encroaching
character
of
privilege
that
the
framers
of
the
constitution
and
they
have
cared
to
provide
that
the
law
shall
bind
equally
on
all
and
especially
that
those
who
make
them
shall
not
exempt
themselves
from
their
operation,
have
only
privilege
senators
and
representatives
themselves
from
the
single
act
of
arrest
in
all
cases,
except
treason,
felony
and
breach
of
the
peace
during
their
attendance
at
the
session
of
their
respective
houses,
and
in
going
to
and
returning
from
the
same
and
from
being
questioned
in
any
other
place
for
any
speech
or
debate
in
the
house.
and
i
would
like
to
suggest,
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
with
surprising
consistency
support
our
position
that
the
speech
or
debate
clause,
provides
no
privilege
to
aides.
perhaps
the
first
case
involving
this
matter
is
kilbourn
against
thompson,
which
was
a
suit
against
the
speaker
of
the
house
and
against
the
sergeant-at-arms
of
the
house,
and
the
house
had
by
vote
decided
that
thompson
was
in
contempt
and
had
ordered
him
to
be
arrested
and
the
speaker
issued
a
warrant
directed
to
the
sergeant-at-arms
to
arrest
thompson.
thompson
got
habeas
corpus
and
he
sued
the
speaker
and
the
sergeant-at-arms
and
this
court
held
that
the
suit
must
be
dismissed
as
to
the
speaker,
he
was
protected
by
the
speech
or
debate
clause
and
it
held
with
the
suit
could
be
maintained
against
thompson.
although
he
was
not
just
a
aide
to
a
congressman
or
a
senator,
but
was
one
of
the
officers
of
the
senate.
he
was
not
protected
by
article
1,
section
6
and
we
know
that
resulted
in
a
judgment
for
$20000
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
and
which
was
eventually
paid
out
of
the
senate's
funds.
and
then
we
have
more
recently,
the
case
of
dombrowski
against
eastland,
which
was
a
suit
against
a
senator
and
against
the
chief
counsel
of
his
committee.
and
the
court
held
that
the
suit
could
not
be
maintained
against
the
senator
at
least
facts
alleged
on
that
case,
but
he
held
that
it
could
be
maintained
against
the
chief
counsel
of
the
committee
and
the
case
went
back
for
a
trial
against
the
chief
counsel.
and
more
recently
we
have
powell
against
mccormack,
which
was
congressman
powell's
suit
against
members
of
the
house
of
representatives,
the
speaker
and
other
members,
and
against
the
doorkeeper
and
other
officers
of
the
house
of
representatives.
and
the
court
held
that
the
speaker
and
the
other
members
could
not
be
sued,
they
were
protected
by
article
1,
section
6
of
the
constitution,
but
it
also
held
that
the
officers
of
the
house
of
representatives
who
were
only
doing
what
they
were
told,
were
subject
to
being
questioned
in
the
courts
and
were
the
basis
for
a
declaratory
judgment
which
this
court
send
the
case
back
to
the
lower
court
to
consider
and
to
enter.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
if
the
sergeant-at-arms
of
the
senate
who
obeys
the
speaker's
warrant
can
be
sued,
if
they
doorkeeper
who
didn't
pay
senator
powell,
congressman
powell
can
be
sued,
i
know
of
no
reason
why
an
aide
is
not
subject
to
the
full
responsibility
of
the
criminal
law.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
if
commits
a
crime,
i
know
of
no
reason
why
he
cannot
be
prosecuted
for
it
and
in
particular,
i
know
of
no
reason
why
he
cannot
be
questioned
about
it,
unless
he
chooses
to
raise
the
fifth
amendment
which
is
available
to
anyone.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
he
was
the
chief
counsel
of
this
subcommittee.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
he
was
the
duly
appointed
long
time
established
and
properly
paid.
the
chief
counsel
of
the
committee
which
was
involved
in
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
sourwine.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
he
was
being
questioned
to
the
extent
of
being
liable
criminally
in
the
courts
of
louisiana
and
civilly
in
the
federal
courts.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
that
i
know
no
any
reason
why
that
rises
higher
than
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
then
the
duty
of
the
executive
to
enforce
law.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes.
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
was
--
we
know
that
there
was
a
recovery
in
kilbourn
and
thompson.
i
have
tried
to
find
out
what
actually
happened
in
dombrowski
and
eastland
and
apparently
it
went
back
to
the
lower
courts
and
was
finally
dismissed
for
want
of
prosecution.
but
i
don't
think
that
effects
the
fact
that
mr.
sourwine
was
held
to
liable
if
it
had
been
pressed
and
that
he
would
have
been
required
to
answer.
after
all
what's
involves
here,
is
an
effort
to
inquire
into
the
question
whether
the
crime
has
been
committed.
if
a
crime
has
been
committed
by
a
aide
or
by
a
third
person
and
it
may
well
not
be
as
a
result
of
the
investigation
that
it
will
be
concluded
that
the
aide
committed
any
crime.
it
may
well
be
that
his
evidence
will
lead
to
someone
else
who
may
have
committed
a
crime
and
that
there
may
be
appropriate
basis
for
bringing
charges
against
some
third
person.
and
i
repeat,
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
speech
or
debate
clause
or
in
any
decision
of
this
court
which
prevents
the
inquiry
of
aides
or
third
persons
as
to
whether
a
crime
has
been
committed.
if
there
is
evidence
that
a
senator
has
committed
a
crime
not
connected
with
speech
or
debate,
he
can
be
prosecuted.
it
was
so
decided
in
the
johnson
case
and
decided
here
in
the
johnson
case
because
the
court
made
it
plain
that
the
case
should
go
back
and
that
senator
johnson
could
be
tried
for
a
crime
committed
while
he
was
congressman.
if
there
is
evidence
that
a
senator
has
committed
a
crime
which
is
adequately
connected
with
speech
or
debate,
he
cannot
be
prosecuted,
he
can
only
be
subject
to
the
discipline
of
the
senator.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
that's
why
i
(voice
overlap)mr.
justice
which
is
adequately
connected
with
speech
or
debate.
i
don't
know
what
the
limits
are.
i
think
they
ought
to
be
rather
broad.
if
--
suppose
a
senator
by
his
own
hands
goes
out
and
steals
a
material
which
he
when
uses
in
a
speech
or
debate,
i
don't
know
whether
he
would
be
exempt
from
prosecution
for
the
theft.
it
is
my
position
that
if
he
directs
his
aide
to
go
out
and
steal
material
for
use
in
the
speech
or
debate
that
the
aide
is
subject
to
prosecution,
that
the
aide
has
no
privilege
under
the
section
--
article
1,
section
6
and
that
the
senator
cannot
extend
an
umbrella
over
him
because
the
senator
has
a
privilege.
with
respect
to
the
senator
we
make
no
other
contention
that
he
can
be
subject
only
to
the
discipline
of
the
senate
with
respect
to
a
matter
which
is
adequately
connected
with
speech
or
debate,
but
there
is
a
nothing
in
the
speech
or
debate
clause
which
protects
either
an
aide
or
a
third
person
from
prosecution
for
any
crime
he
may
have
committed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
he
could
be?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
i
suggest
--
no
i
don't
say
there
is
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
decision
however
is
that
mr.
dombrowski
can
be
sued.
i
agree
there
is
no
decision
there
as
to
the
extent
to
which
he
can
be
questioned
but
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
as
far
as
i
know
this
is
the
first
time
that
you
actually
had
that
question.
as
i
was
saying,
we
think
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
speech
or
debate
clause
which
protects
either
an
aide
or
an
third
person
from
prosecution
for
any
crime
he
may
have
committed.
as
i
have
already
said
an
aide
or
a
third
person
is
entitled
to
the
privilege
against
self
incrimination,
but
such
a
person,
a
non
member
is
not
entitled
to
any
privilege
under
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
tenney
against
brandhove
involved
a
committee
of
the
california
legislation.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
know
that
it
is
a
constitutional
basis
mr.
justice.
i
think
that
analytically
it
is
a
construction
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1871,
under
which
the
suit
was
brought
and
it
was
held
that
the
held
civil
rights
act
should
not
be
construed
to
provide
for
a
liability
of
a
member
of
a
state
legislature.
now,
i
have
no
doubt
that
in
the
background
to
that
question
of
construction
were
some
constitutional
considerations,
derived
out
of
no
particular
clause
of
any
constitution
but
derived
it
seems
to
me
i
can
say
out
of
constitutional
history.
the
state
legislatures
just
like
congress
are
the
lineal
decedents
of
the
british
parliament.
there
were
centuries
of
controversy
and
the
struggle
between
parliament
and
the
crown
with
respect
to
the
privileges
of
the
two
houses.
at
various
times,
particularly
the
18th
century,
the
privileges
got
really
out
of
hand.
the
history
shows
that
members
sold
the
right
to
be
a
servant
of
a
member
in
order
that
the
servant
would
not
be
subject
to
suit
in
civil
cases.
that
was
abolishment
to
before
1789.
that
history
i
think
is
part
of
the
reason
why
the
privilege
was
limited
to
senators
and
representatives,
but
in
the
--
tenney
case
the
decision
was,
that
they
could
not
be
subjected
to
civil
liability
and
let
me
point
out
again
that
this
is
a
suit
against
amendments,
not
against
anybody
else.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
was
plainly
not
under
the
speech
and
debate
clause.
i
recognize
that,
nor
does
it
purport
to
be
an
interpretation
of
the
california
constitution.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
i
think
you
will
find
and
i
read
it
as
carefully
as
i
could
with
just
this
in
mind
i
think
you
will
find
that
it
really
boils
down
to
being
a
construction
in
the
broad
sense
not
of
any
particular
language,
a
construction
of
the
civil
rights
act,
on
which
the
suit
was
based
and
to
hold
that
congress
in
passing
that
statute
could
not
have
intended
that
it
provide
for
suits
against
members
of
state
legislatures
for
doing
what
they
regarded
as
their
legislative
duty.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
am
on
the
first
place
mr.
justice
i
doubt
if
it
corresponds
with
the
facts.
i
expect
that
many
members
of
congress
had
i
recall
john
quincy
adams
went
to
russia
with
his
father
john
adams.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
staff
were
not
as
elaborate
as
they
are
now
and
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice
i
think
you
can,
because
of
this
history
about
the
extension
of
the
privilege
far
beyond
members
in
parliament
which
came
to
be
recognize
as
a
great
abuse
and
was
completely
eliminated
by
parliament
and
then
the
colonies,
shorty
before
1789
and
i
doubt
very
much
that
the
distinguished
gentlemen
of
the
first
congress
operated
entirely
on
their
own.
it's
perfectly
plain
they
didn't
have
as
many
constituents
as
present
members
have,
they
didn't
have
electronic
and
other
aids
available.
they
didn't
have
a
volume
material
pouring
in
on
them
with
which
they
had
to
deal.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
think
primarily
mr.
justice
nevertheless
the
history
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
the
history
of
the
speech
and
debate
clause
is
to
protect
the
members
not
entirely
but
it
large
they
were
the
members
who
were
being
arrested
and
put
in
the
tower
and
senator
ervin
talked
about
congressman,
the
senators
being
intimidated.
now
perhaps
one
reason
you
want
to
protect
congressman
and
senators
from
being
intimidated
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice,
but
i
don't
think
that
it
follows
that
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
if
you
are
guided
only
by
that
purpose,
you
would
of
course
give
a
very
squeaking
application,
i
can't
say
construction,
a
very
squeaking
application
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause,
you
would
ignore
in
either
house,
you
would
ignore
the
senators
or
representatives,
i
don't
know
what
else
that
you
would
ignore,
but
i
find
no
basis
for
that.
i
think
the
public
can
be
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
that
the
purpose
can
be
adequately
maintained
by
guiding
absolutely
against
the
senator
or
representative
being
questioned
in
any
other
place
with
respect
to
any
speech
or
debate.
and
i
know
of
nothing
in
our
history
to
indicate
that
congressman
and
senators
have
not
been
fearless
or
that
they
have
been
restrained
in
their
action
because
they
think
that
the
executive
branch
and
the
judicial
branch
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
mr.
justice
i
think
that
is
putting
it
in
an
unreal
and
if
i
may
say
so
in
inappropriate
way.
i
don't
know
how
many
aides
there
are
of
congressman
and
senators.
there
are
535
congressman
and
senators.
if
they
average
20
each
which
is
probably
low,
that
would
be
ten
thousand
people
who
would
be
entitled
to
all
of
these
immunities.
i
suspect
that
it's
more
than
--
i
suspect
that
is
closer
to
twenty
or
thirty
thousand
people
when
you
include
secretaries
and
other
persons.
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
think
that
either
the
founders
intended
or
that
it
can
fairly
be
found
within
that
quite
precise
language
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause
that
there
was
to
be
a
large
mass
of
people
not
merely
in
the
capital,
but
all
over
the
country
because
many
of
these
aides
are
back
in
the
home
districts
who
are
protected
against
being
questioned
in
any
place.
the
way
it
is
asserted
that
dr.
rodberg
and
these
outsiders
should
be
protected
here.
as
i
have
said
no
case,
and
i
repeat,
no
case
has
ever
given
such
a
privilege
to
an
aide.
moreover
the
privilege
applies
only
to
speech
or
debate
in
either
house
and
many
of
the
questions
which
might
be
asked
here
relate
to
matters
far
outside
of
either
house.
senator
ervin
referred
yesterday
to
the
massachusetts,
the
early
massachusetts
case
of
coffin
against
coffin.
it
is
rather
fun
to
read
that
case
as
you
might
guess
from
the
name
it
arouse
out
of
nantucket.
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
whether
the
two
parties
were
brothers
or
otherwise
related,
they
may
not
have
been.
it
involved
action
on
the
floor
of
the
house
of
representatives
in
massachusetts,
in
boston
where
there
had
been
a
hope
with
respect
to
establishing
a
new
office
of
notary
public
in
nantucket
and
question
was
raised
as
to
who
would
be
named
for
the
office.
the
house
voted
to
establish
the
new
office
which
was
undoubtedly
a
legislative
business
and
then
it
developed
that
while
other
legislative
matter
was
going
on
and
still
on
the
floor
of
the
house,
but
had
an
area
aside
over
beside
the
speaker's
bench,
the
one
representative
came
to
mr.
coffin
and
said,
that
they
were
going
to
name
another
mr.
coffin
and
this
mr.
coffin
said,
what
that
criminal?
and
don't
you
know
that
he
was
involved
in
that
bank
robbery
down
there.
now
it
is
perfectly
true
that
coffin
against
coffin
is
regarded
and
rightly
regarded
as
one
of
the
leading
cases
in
this
area.
again
it
is
written
by
theosophical
persons,
the
then
chief
justice,
all
the
other
judges
were
well
known
massachusetts
figures.
there
is
a
long
discussion
of
speech
or
debate,
but
the
result
of
the
case
is
that
mr.
coffin
was
held
liable
for
a
judgment
of
the
$2500
which
in
1804
was
no
inconsiderable
amount.
because
the
court
held
that
this
matter
happening
on
the
floor
of
the
house
but
to
decide
and
after
the
vote
had
actually
been
taken
did
not
relate
to
a
speech
or
debate
in
either
house.
the
case
is
of
course
of
great
historical
significance,
but
its
decision
i
think
is
on
the
side
which
we
advance
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
mr.
chief
justice
that's
a
nice
question.
i
am
just
running
through
my
mind
the
arguments
on
both
side.
perhaps
some
day
this
court
will
have
to
answer
it.
i
don't
myself
feel
qualified
at
this
time
to
answer
it.
certainly,
the
congress
should
have
great
power
to
legislate
with
respect
to
its
own
activities,
not
merely
power
to
protect,
but
i
think
also
power
to
put
out,
that
is
power
to
say
the
contempts
of
congress
shall
be
tried
in
the
courts
as
has
been
the
practice
for
a
long
time.
i
think
without
meaning
to
argue
another
case
that
congress
can
provide
that
crimes
committed
by
congressman
can
be
tried
in
the
courts.
so,
i
think
that
quite
an
argument
can
be
made
that
not
because
of
any
express
power,
but
something
arising
out
of
what
chief
justice
marshall
said
it
is
a
constitution
we
are
expounding.
that
if
congress
did
that
in
sufficiently
limited
terms
it
probably
would
be
done.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but,
it
is
not
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
and
i
think
congressman.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
congress
might
spell
that
out
in
more
detail.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
and
i
suspect
that
congress
at
least
in
the
federal
courts,
i
don't
know
whether
congress
could
enact
it
with
respect
to
evidence
in
the
state
courts.
now
there
is
one
final
point
here
to
which
very
little
reference
has
been
made.
we
have
not
only
aides
but
we
have
third
parties.
here
representatives
of
the
m.
i.
t.
press
and
the
beacon
press,
and
i
would
say
that
a
fortiori
they
have
no
privilege
not
to
testify.
it
maybe
that
their
testimony
cannot
be
used
against
the
senator
but
it
can
be
used
against
them
and
it
can
be
use
against
other
non-members.
only
a
senator
or
a
representative
is
protected
by
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
and
in
particular,
the
speech
or
debate
clause
has
nothing
to
do
with
republication.
in
the
first
place,
i
don't
want
to
concede
that
we
are
really
dealing
with
republication
here
because
as
i
understand
the
situation
that
most
of
the
47
volumes
of
the
pentagon
papers
were
not
read
by
senator
gravel,
after
all
it's
seven
million
words.
he
read
some
of
them
and
he
then
introduced
the
others
into
the
record.
they
were
never
published
as
a
part
of
the
record.
indeed,
what's
involved
here
is
senator
gravel's
effort
to
get
them
published
and
they
were
published
by
the
beacon
press.
what
i
suggest
to
you
that
that
may
well
not
be
a
republication,
but
maybe
not
protected
as
the
republication
of
material
which
has
been
published
as
a
part
of
a
congressional
activity.
in
an
event,
the
speech
or
debate
clause
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
a
private
publication
by
senator
gravel
which
is
not
a
publication
of
the
congressional
materials.
here
the
chairman
of
the
committee
refused
to
authorize
the
expenditure,
the
funds
for
the
reporter
and
they
have
not
been
published
by
the
congress
and
senator
gravel
has
caused
them
to
be
published
elsewhere
which
i
suggest
is
not
privilege
under
any
conception
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
know
how
much
was
in
the
--
as
far
as
i
know
none
is
in
the
congressional
record.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
how
much
of
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
all
of
those
four
volumes
i
believe,
as
far
as,
i
know
the
four
volumes
have
never
been
published.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
were
47
volumes.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
i
understand
that
43
of
them
published,
most
of
the
43
of
them
published
by
defense
department.
and
let
me
finally
close
by
saying
that
there
is
no
first
amendment
question,
here.
no
one
is
trying
to
stop
publication,
it's
been
done,
the
material
has
been
published.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
were
prior
efforts
to
try
to
stop
it
but
as
far
as
beacon
press
is
concerned,
it
has
published
it
and
the
majority
of
the
court
in
the
new
york
times
case,
made
it
quite
plain
though
there
could
be
publication,
the
consequences
of
that
publication
remain
for
consideration,
and
they
might
be
criminal
and
they
might
be
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
was,
that
was
left
open
and
that
mr.
justice,
is
what
we
are
trying
to
explore
here
to
see
whether
there
was
any
crime
committed
in
connection
with
the
publication
of
these
materials,
and
we
are
trying
to
obtain
evidence
on
that
subject
and
i
repeat,
i
do
not
see
that
the
first
amendment
is
involve
in
anyway
because
the
material
has
been
published,
the
speech
has
been
made,
the
presses
have
rolled,
the
situation
now
is
what
are
the
consequences
of
that
and
we
believe
that
we
are
entitled
with
the
evidence
of
these
persons
who
have
been
subpoenaed
in
this
case.
