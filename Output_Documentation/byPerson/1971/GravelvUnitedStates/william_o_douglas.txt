justice

but
that
raises
the
question
senator
whether
everything
that
stand
classified
is
out
from
it
under
the
first
amendment
and
that's
a
very
large
question?
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
can't
steal
anything
in
the
public
domain,
can
you?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
these
are
loaded
questions.
i
mean,
you
say
yes
then
you’re
stuck
with
the
answer.
justice
william
o.
douglas
(inaudible)
first
amendment
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
then
you
would
be
squarely
in
the
first
amendment?
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
(voice
overlap))
that
the
secretary
and
congressman
johnson
would
have
testified
to
of
these
things
putting
(inaudible)
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
we
said
in
the
johnson
case
that
any
person
who
helped
the
legislator
in
respect
to
speech
and
debate
cannot
be
inquired
if
the
object
to
attack
legislator's
motives
speaking
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
if
you're
a
prosecutor
it
depends
how
you're
making
a
case,
get
the
staff
of
the
senator
or
the
congressman,
put
them
on
the
stand
and
they
know
everything
goes
on
in
office?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
we
don't
know?
justice
william
o.
douglas
(inaudible)
session,
is
it
not?
justice
william
o.
douglas
even
though
they
get
the
testimony
from
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
why
does
this
group
that
he
works
with,
have
immunity?
justice
william
o.
douglas
we're
just
looking
at
one
now
and
why
isn't
he
inside
of
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
they
finally
get
at
the
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
we
hear
in
the
brief
in
the
senate
yesterday
that
the,
there
may
be
disciplinary
actions
against
the
senator?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
know,
what
i
mean
to
say
is
to
say
rodberg
is
non-actor
and
this
is
---
justice
william
o.
douglas
(voice
overlap)
other
things
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
then
really
it
amounts
to
(inaudible)
because
as
a
practical
matter
you
can
visit,
prepare
the
case
through
the
staff
of
the
senator
or
congressmen?
justice
william
o.
douglas
at
the
start
of
the
argument,
you
suggested
that
we
read
the
article
1,
section
6.
in
following
your
argument
that
i'm
wondered
if
perhaps
you
would
have
(inaudible)
but
it
denies
because
it
doesn't
talk
about
indictment,
it
says
shall
not
be
questioned?
justice
william
o.
douglas
it's
much
broader
than
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
if
you
draw
the
lines
of,
say
that
the
staff
cannot
be
summoned
then
you're
protecting
him?
justice
william
o.
douglas
may
be
so
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
think
it's
not
indictment,
part
of
this
is
just
(inaudible)
and
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
he
wasn't
questioned
though
was
he?
this
was
--
the
question
was
alleged
(inaudible)
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
have
just
re-read
dombrowski
and
there
is
not
a
word
in
there
mr.
solicitor
general
that
indicates
that
sourwine
could
be
put
on
the
stand
and
questioned
respecting
senator
eastland's
motives
and
purposes
or
implications
or
complications
of
project?
justice
william
o.
douglas
there
is
not
a
word
that
can
be
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
this
was
a
shell
of
a
case
and
we
sent
it
back
to
the
trial?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
think
this
is
a
first
time
when
we
had
that?
justice
william
o.
douglas
so
punishing
publication
might
be
a
serious
as
kind
of
estoppal?
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
was
left
open,
wasn't
it?
