it
was

before
justices?
justice
byron
r.
white
senator
what
about
reidel?
would
you
say
stanley
–
how
much
of
stanley
--
what
part
of
your
argument
about
stanley
can
survive
reidel?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
about
--
senator
i'll
put
you
in
a
case.
suppose
a
bookstore
owner
is
charged
with
selling
an
obscene
item
to
a
certain
customer
and
he
responds,
well,
it's
sold
for
his
private
use
in
his
home
and
the
government
concedes
that
that's
quite
true,
but
nevertheless
that
this
was
commercialization
of
obscenity
and
reidel
permits
a
prosecution
for
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
yes,
oh,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
would
say
stanley
would
permit,
even
on
the
opposition,
stanley
would
permit
prosecutions
for
selling
to
a
person
for
his
private
use
in
his
home,
that
doesn't
bother
you
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
your
case,
but
what
is
it,
do
you
think
your
position
is
inconsistent
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
would
say
that,
you
may
have
the
right
to
possess
obscene
material
in
your
home,
but
you
have
no
right
to
buy
it.
in
the
sense,
at
least
you
don't
such
a
right
to
buy
it,
but
your
seller
is
immune?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
have
sellers
though
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
would
say
the
seller,
even
if
the
purchaser
has
the
right
to
have
it,
even
if
a
man
has
the
right
to
have
in
his
own
home,
a
seller
doesn't
necessarily
or
just
doesn't
have
the
right
to
sell
obscene
material
though?
justice
byron
r.
white
thirty-seven
photographs?
justice
byron

and
i
was
still
