justice
william
h.
rehnquist
senator,
i
take
it
that
the
solicitor
general's
argument
is
that
since
all
concede
that
the
material
here
was
obscene
and
since
roth
says
obscenity
is
not
protected
by
the
first
amendment
that
therefore,
the
fact
that
it
may
have
been
in
form
of
book,
does
not
really
make
it
any
difference
from
narcotics.
what
is
your
response
to
that
line
of
argument?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
senator
kuchel,
i
suppose
one
could
carry
that
one
step
further
and
say
that
the
commercial
importer
might
engage
in
self-censorship,
if
he
has
to
draw
the
line
somewhere
between
obscene
publications
and
non-obscene
and
they
would
have
a
chilling
effect
on
him?
