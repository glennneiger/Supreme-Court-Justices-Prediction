we’ll

arguments
next
in
number

mr.
solicitor
general,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
solicitor
general.
senator
kuchel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
senator
kuchel,
let
me
ask
you
this.
let's
assume
for
the
moment
if
we
accept
that
proposition
that
the
rights
of
privacy
which
attaches
to
a
stanley
in
his
home,
follows
him
wherever
he
takes
that
material,
that
is
if
he
takes
it
to
his
office
or
as
you
said
summer
place
or
out
in
the
park,
as
long
as
he
is
not
bothering
anyone
else
with
it,
does
that
necessarily
–
does
it
necessarily
follow
that,
that
right
of
privacy
pretends
the
bringing
into
the
united
states
at
the
borders
having
in
mind
the
broad
powers
of
government
to
deal
with
him
importations,
or
do
you
not
have
to
carry
it
one
step
beyond
that's
really
what
i
am
asking?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
then
in
separating
the
search
from
the
seizure,
what
you
are
really
saying
is
that
you
don't
want
to
inhibit
their
right
to
search,
which
is
for
a
broad
prophylactic
purposes,
narcotics,
guns,
hand
grenades,
but
what
they
find
during
that
search
then
falls
under
the
ban
of
stanley?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wasn't
stanley
more
narrowly
a
privacy
than
a
broad
first
amendment
base?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
stanley
was
based
on
the
right
of
privacy
narrowly
rather
than
upon
broad
first
amendment
rights
with
respect
to
materials
and
publications
and
that
sort
of
thing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
you’re
saying
i
take
it
is
that
the
individual
in
stanley’s
posture
may
go
somewhere
and
buy
or
go
abroad
and
bring
it
back,
and
it
is
protected
by
the
privacy
in
the
home
under
stanley
even
thought
the
seller
from
who
he
acquired
it
in
the
united
states,
if
he
brought
it
here,
might
be
prosecuted
for
the
sale?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
ask
you
a
one
question
to
pursue
a
point
that
the
solicitor
general
was
making.
i
think
he
made
the
point
of
the
difficulty
of
tracking
this
type
of
material
once
it
got
to
into
the
country.
now,
under
your
submission
in
this
case,
suppose
two
weeks
after
he
got
it
safely
at
home
under
your
theory
that
he
was
protected
to
bring
it
there,
he
then
made
a
100,000
copies
and
began
to
sell
them.
then
under,
roth
and
the
other
cases,
i
suppose
your
position
would
be
that
state
or
the
federal
government
--
the
state
can
deal
with
him
at
that
stage
by
prosecuting
him
if
they
have
an
appropriate
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
solicitor
general,
do
you
have
anything
further?
senator
kuchel
before
you
leave,
you
appeared
in
this
case
under
unusual
circumstances
and
under
our
request.
on
behalf
of
the
court,
we
want
to
thank
you
for
you
assistance
tor
us
and
towards
the
assistance
to
the
your
unknown
client
to
whom,
you
represented
here.
thank
you.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
number
70-2,
united
states
against
12
reels
of
film.
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
senator
kuchel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
that
means
that
he
has
the
right
to
go
somewhere
and
buy
it
if
it's
admittedly
forbidden
hardcore
pornography?
or
just
are
you
limiting
it
to
the
right
to
carry
it
in
his
briefcase
or
his
pocket,
have
it
in
his
office
or
on
the
train
or
in
an
airplane?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
that
include
the
right
of
someone
else
vicariously
through
the
individual's
first
amendment
right
to
sell
it
to
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
senator.
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
have
four
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
i
understood
that
senator
kuchel
correctly,
he
would
concede
that
the
very
material
here
sought
to
be
imported
by
this
man,
could
--
the
state
of
california
or
any
state
be
prohibited
from
sale
in
public
and
he
is
tracing
it
just
from
the
chain
of
getting
it
outside
the
country
and
getting
it
into
his
own
home
and
his
own
office
or
his
own
pocket?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn’t
that’s
stipulated,
conceded
out
of
this
case
by
the
concession
if
it
is
for
private
purposes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let's
say
mr.
solicitor
general
that
the
man
had
three
convictions
previously
for
selling
this
adult
material?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there's
nothing
to
prevent
the
government
from
acquiring
him
to
sign
a
sworn
statement
that
this
will
not
be
sold,
is
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then
if
he
violates
it,
make
a
crime
out
of
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentleman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
hear
arguments
next
