well,
i
think
of
why
not
is,
reidel,
isn't
it,
reidel
against
the
united
states,
that
covers
the
seller,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
seller
--
the
seller
of
such
material?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
--
that's
squarely
covered
by
the
reidel
case,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn't
know
you
thought
it
was
such
a
narrow
decision?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
and
the
federal
government
has
no
ligitimate
--
justice
potter
stewart
except
possibly
by
state
law.
justice
potter
stewart
in
first
place
that
was
not
a
court
opinion,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
stanley's
home
and
the
things
in
it
certainly
could
have
been
added
in
search
by
--
under
a
search?
justice
potter
stewart
there
may
have
been
more
rigid
standards
under
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendments
than
a
border
search
under
the
fourth
amendment
but
it
was
searchable
under
the
proper
fourth
amendment
standards,
but
that
did
not
deter
the
court
from
saying
that
he
absolutely
could
not
be
prosecuted
or
convicted
substantively
because
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment,
is
that
your
point?
justice
potter
stewart
all
those
cases
senator
involve
do
they
do
not
interference
with
the
rights
of
others,
personal
or
private
that
is
the
use
of
the
streets
by
the
citizenry
or
the
use
of
the
courthouse
as
in
the
cox
case
or
so
on?
justice
potter
stewart
quite
different
from
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it's
not
your
point
is
it
that
the
first
amendment
is
wholly
inapplicable
to
this
case
because
these
things
were
printed
outside
the
united
states?
justice
potter
stewart
no.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
presumably
they
were?
justice
potter
stewart
has
this
statute
got
any
relevant
legislative
history?
it
seems
to
be
enacted
in
1930.
is
there
any
thing
in
the
legislative
history
(voice
overlap)?
