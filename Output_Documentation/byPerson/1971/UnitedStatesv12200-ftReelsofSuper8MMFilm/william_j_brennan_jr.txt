justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
this
mr.
solicitor
general?
i
didn't
find
that
there
is
any
disagreement
that
these
materials
are
obscene.
two
things
were
returned
to
that
status,
one
a
sealed
the
film
and
something
else,
and
i
thought
there
was
no
disagreement
with
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
thought
the
real
question
here
was
whether
the
fact
they
bought
in
assuming
obscenity
for
personal
use
rather
than
commercial
use?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
speaking
from
myself.
i
have
not
thought,
compared
it
to
this
argument,
and
that
is,
i
had
to
two
another
cases,
that
i
had
to
examine
the
material.
i
didn't
think
that
any
issue
of
obscenity
was
contested
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
have
to
look
at
it,
do
i?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
no
one
seems
to
have
contested?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
senator,
may
i
ask,
getting
it
back
to
my
colloquy
with
the
solicitor
general.
i
am
right
am
i
not,
that
we
may
decide
this
case
on
the
premise
material
here
involved
by
any
definition
are
obscene?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
senator,
would
that
be
your
answer
also,
you
know
under
the
fourth
amendment,
i
think
there
have
been
decisions
partly
against
the
courts
of
appeals
certainly
the
ninth
circuit,
that
for
fourth
amendment
purposes
border
searches
allow
wide
latitude,
and
would
search
his
house,
from
the
searches
at
home.
would
you
answer
be
the
same
i
guess
to
the
colloquy
you
were
having
with
the
chief
justice?
like
a
distinction
between
border
and
other
inspections,
in
light
of
the
greater
latitude,
that's
easily
stems
from
the
fourth
amendment
border
searches?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
i
was
trying
to
get
is
that
i
gather
you
are
saying
that
stanley's
rights,
the
privacy
aspect
more
on
the
on
the
first
amendment
than
it
does
on
the
fourth?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
would
be
your
answer
to
why
is
there
no
difference
for
the
border
search
or
border
inspection
and
the
seizure
at
home?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
tell
me
senator.
we
had
number
of
cases
that
recognized
the
time
and
location
limitations
in
exercise
of
first
amendment
right.
for
example
if
someone
couldn’t
get
up
here
and
make
a
speech
in
the
middle
of
your
argument
from
the
audience.
isn't
there
something
of
that
involved
here,
a
distinction
between
the
home
and
the
exercise
of
the
right
as
you
describe
at
the
border?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
do
you
distinguish
those
cases
in
which
you
have
said
there
are
those
limitations
in
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
said
how
do
you
distinguish
this
situation
from
those
cases
in
which
we
said
there
are
those
limitations
on
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
right,
and
time
and
location
when
we
couldn’t
make
a
speech
as
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
am
thinking
of
the
speech
that
certainly
the
first
amendment
might
protect
it
if
delivered
out
on
steps,
but
not
if
it
was
delivered
in
this
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
are
not
suggesting
that
all
of
these
defendants
so
called
are
not
forms
of
expression,
are
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
expression,
are
they
not?
i
see
they
are
reels
of
film.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
perhaps
it
is
a
whole
lot,
much
more
than
this
i
thought
they
were
good
many
things,
but
they
are
forms
of
expression,
aren’t
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
--
i
just
wonder
do
you
say
notwithstanding
stanley?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
what
stanley
said
that
this
didn’t
effect
to
us
but
–
and
it
said
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
actually
roth
suggested
i
suppose,
did
it
not
that
whatever
is
obscenity,
it's
something
that
the
government
has
complete
power
to
suppress,
suppress
absolute,
but
stanley
has
sort
of
cut
into
that
a
bit,
didn’t
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
mr.
solicitor.
i
am
just
suggesting
what
stanley
stands
for
at
least
is
that
in
the
circumstances
involved
in
stanley,
government
has
no
power
to
suppress
something
called
obscenity?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
didn’t
join
stanley,
as
you
know.
i
did
not
join
stanley.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
that
means
the
seller
could
go
to
prison,
but
not
the
buyer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
see
anything
senator,
are
you
familiar
with
our
decision
last
term
in
eisenstadt,
the
one
that
involved
the
sale
of
the
contraceptive?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
alright
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
this
mr.
solicitor
general?
i
didn't

that
there
