mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
here
on
appeal
from
the
central
district
court
of
california,
which
held
unconstitutional
an
act
of
congress
providing
for
the
forfeiture
of
obscene
material
imported
into
the
united
states.
this
present
case
and
the
one
which
follows
are
sequels
to
the
decisions
of
the
court
last
term
in
united
states
against
reidel
and
united
states
against
thirty-seven
photographs.
those
cases
involved
transmissions
through
the
mails
and
importation
of
obscene
materials
for
commercial
purposes.
the
distinctive
feature
of
this
case
is
that
the
importation
here
is
alleged
to
be
for
private
use.
the
present
proceeding
is
an
in
rem
proceeding
against
a
number
of
items
which
were
imported
by
the
claimant.
some
of
those
have
been
returned
to
the
claimant
as
not
obscene.
the
others
are
on
file
at
the
court.
i
believe
it
can
be
said
that
if
anything
is
obscene,
these
items
are
and
particularly
the
printed
material.
these
in
my
view
are
not
borderline
materials.
if
the
court
is
disposed
to
hold
that
there
is
nothing
that
can
be
held
to
be
obscene
under
the
constitution,
that
will
dispose
of
this
case.
but
if
obscenity
still
has
any
constitutional
meaning,
then
i
believe
that
these
materials
would
have
to
be
found
to
be
obscene
by
any
standard
which
has
ever
been
suggested
by
the
court.
when
the
complaint
for
forfeiture
came
on
to
be
heard,
the
district
court
granted
a
motion
to
dismiss,
relying
on
the
prior
decision
of
the
same
court
in
the
thirty-seven
photographs
case,
the
one
which
was
reversed
last
term.
at
that
time
the
claimant
filed
an
affidavit,
stating
that
the
items
were
not,
and
i
quote
“were
not
imported
by
me
for
any
commercial
purpose,
but
were
intended
to
be
used
and
possessed
by
me
personally.”
and
in
response
to
the
united
states
attorney
filed
a
motion
for
a
stay
of
the
order
of
dismissal
in
which
he
stated
that
the
united
states
had
and
again
i
quote,
“no
evidence
with
which
to
contradict
mr.
paladini’s
affidavit
and
therefore
does
not
confess
the
fact
that
this
was
a
private
importation.”
there
are
at
least
two
lines
of
reasoning
on
which
the
government’s
case
maybe
rested.
in
the
first
place,
if
these
materials
are
obscene
as
i
have
contended
or
if
they
must
be
regarded
as
obscene,
since
the
court
below
has
rendered
a
motion
to
dismiss
without
determining
the
question
of
obscenity,
then
the
materials
are
not
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment
and
that
would
seem
to
dispose
off
the
matter
since
no
fourth
amendment
question
is
involved.
nearly
15
years
ago
in
roth,
this
court
decided
that
obscenity
is
not
within
the
area
of
constitutionally
protected
speech
or
press.
there
is
nothing
in
this
court’s
subsequent
decisions
to
indicate
that
this
is
still
not
the
law
and
quite
the
contrary.
in
stanley
against
georgia
which
is
the
basis
of
the
decision
of
the
court
below,
this
court
said
roth
and
the
cases
following
that
decision
are
not
impaired
by
today’s
holding,
that
was
in
1969.
in
last
term
in
reidel,
the
court
quoted
the
language
from
roth
and
said,
roth
has
not
been
overruled,
it
remains
the
law
in
this
court
and
governs
this
case.
in
thirty-seven
photographs
decided
the
same
day,
mr.
justice
white
speaking
for
four
members
of
the
court,
reiterated
the
statement
that
obscenity
is
not
within
the
scope
of
first
amendment’s
protection.
if
this
material
is
obscene
by
any
standard
as
i
have
contended
and
if
obscenity
is
not
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
then
it
would
seem
to
follow
that
there
is
no
constitutional
basis.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
that
is
correct.
i
am
simply
saying
that
they
are
obscene,
but
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice,
that
is
the
question,
but
i
don't
think
that
question
can
be
escaped
by
examining
the
material
and
saying
it
is
not
obscene
and
that
is
the
--
for
example,
blank
pieces
of
paper
and
this
is
not
a
framed
issue,
this
is
a
real
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
that
is
accurate
mr.
justice,
except
that
i
think
that
these
materials
are
obscene.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
not
to
assume
that
they
are
obscene.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
or
if
you
say
that
obscenity
is
not
relevant
in
the
case,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
should
not
be
disposed
of
on
ground
that
obscenity
has
not
been
established.
another
approach
leads
to
the
same
result.
stanley
against
georgia
held
that
obscene
material
seized
in
a
man’s
library
in
his
home
under
a
search
warrant,
authorizing
a
search
for
evidence
of
gambling
materials
could
not
be
made
the
basis
of
a
criminal
prosecution
for
possessing
the
obscene
items.
i
find
no
basis
for
objecting
to
the
result,
though
as
i
contended
last
week
in
counselman
against
hitchcock,
some
of
the
language
used
may
have
been
unnecessarily
broad.
as
it
was
pointed
out
by
the
three
concurring
justices
in
that
case,
the
decision
is
perhaps
best
rested
on
the
fourth
amendment
as
an
illegal
search,
not
adequately
supported
by
the
warrant
which
the
officers
had
obtained.
but
on
that
basis,
it
is
not
a
first
amendment
case
and
has
no
application
here.
this
is
borne
out
by
the
court’s
decision
in
the
reidel
and
thirty-seven
photographs
cases.
the
reidel
decision
held
that
the
rationale
of
stanley
was
not
sufficient
to
bar
a
prosecution
of
a
person
who
on
a
commercial
basis
mailed
obscene
material
to
a
recipient
at
his
home.
though
stanley
had
referred
to
the
right
to
receive
information
and
ideas,
this
right
for
receive
was
not
sufficient
to
allow
the
recipient
to
obtain
obscene
material
through
the
mails
from
a
commercial
mailer
as
against
the
right
of
the
united
states,
constitutionally
to
forbid
its
passage
through
to
the
mails.
and
in
thirty-seven
photographs,
this
conclusion
was
reached
with
respect
to
obscene
material,
a
single
set
of
37
photographs
which
an
individual
had
acquired
abroad
and
sought
to
bring
into
the
united
states
through
customs
with
a
view
to
using
them
in
a
commercial
publication.
as
indicated
by
my
response
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
question,
the
sole
difference
between
this
case
and
thirty-seven
photographs,
is
that
here
the
importation
is
allegedly
to
be
for
the
personal
use
of
the
importer,
and
we
have
no
evidence
to
the
contrary.
in
view
of
reidel
however,
that
would
seem
to
be
a
distinction
without
a
difference.
if
a
person
cannot
have
things
mailed
to
him
without
causing
the
mailer
to
commit
a
crime,
it
is
rather
hard
to
see
that
he
should
be
able
to
bring
things
into
the
country
himself
as
against
the
“broad
and
sweeping”
powers
of
congress
to
regulate
foreign
commerce
and
the
traditional
comprehensive
power
of
this
and
all
other
nations
over
all
materials
entering
the
country
at
the
borders.
now
this
was
the
view
of
the
four
justices
constituting
the
plurality
in
thirty-seven
photographs.
they
said
in
thirty-seven
photographs,
the
trial
court
erred
in
reading
stanley
as
immunizing
from
seizure,
obscene
materials
possessed
at
a
port
of
entry
for
the
purpose
of
importations
for
private
use.
and
then
obscene
material
maybe
removed
in
the
channels
of
commerce
when
discovered
in
the
luggage
of
a
returning
foreign
traveler,
even
though
intended
solely
for
his
private
use
and
the
finally,
a
port
of
entry
is
not
a
traveler's
home.
as
i
have
contended
the
first
amendment
does
not
apply
since
the
material
is
obscene
or
must
be
taken
as
obscene
and
it
is
no
less
obscene,
because
it
is
imported
to
private
use.
the
court
would
not
hold
i
suppose
that
a
person
who
would
lawfully
bring
in
narcotics
or
a
hand
grenade
on
the
ground
that
he
was
going
to
use
the
narcotics
or
the
hand
grenade
personally.
i
know
of
no
basis
on
which
it
can
be
determined,
either
under
the
first
amendment
or
otherwise
that
personal
use
provides
some
sort
of
a
protection
against
otherwise
applicable
laws.
now
i
suppose
if
the
court
hold
is
a
person
can
import
foreign
credit
book,
which
violates
an
american
copyright
on
the
ground
that
he
is
going
to
use
the
book
himself.
i
well
remember
the
(inaudible)
editions
of
american
books,
which
we
used
to
buy
in
europe
a
generation
ago,
and
there
a
clear
statement
that
they
could
not
be
imported
into
the
united
states
under
the
copyright
laws.
i've
read
a
farewell
to
arms
in
a
(inaudible)
edition
and
took
care
to
have
it
finished
before
i
came
home,
perhaps
this
was
unnecessary,
if
the
decision
below
is
sound,
but
i
did
not
think
so
then.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
was
before
stanley
was
decided,
but
this
is
the
same
constitution
mr.
justice
and
the
same
for
first
amendment.
congress
has
sweeping
power
at
our
borders
though
its
power
to
regulate
foreign
commerce,
not
power
of
course
to
violate
the
constitution,
but
power
under
the
constitution
to
regulate
foreign
commerce
in
terms
which
are
not
qualified
by
the
constitutional
provision
itself.
i
can
find
nothing
in
the
terms
of
the
first
amendment,
which
limits
the
power
of
congress
to
bar
the
importation
of
obscene
materials,
even
when
they
are
intended
for
private
use.
it
can
be
done,
i
suggest,
only
by
erecting
a
very
substantial
penumbra
around
the
first
amendment
extending
quite
far
beyond
its
terms
and
beyond
the
privacy
of
the
home
or
the
person
which
were
involved
in
the
stanley
case
and
in
griswold
against
connecticut.
such
an
extension
is
not
warranted
by
any
constitutional
precedent
or
standard
that
i
know
of.
if
it
were
done,
it
is
hard
to
tell
how
the
limits
of
the
penumbra
could
be
determined.
it
would
be
i
suppose
whatever
this
court
thinks
it
should
be.
of
course,
constitutional
improvisations
cannot
always
be
interpreted
literally,
but
finding
support
in
the
first
amendment
for
the
result
reached
by
the
court
below
would
carry
the
court
farther
way
from
the
constitutional
language,
i
submit,
than
the
court
ought
to
go,
and
farther
away
from
the
language
than
is
required
or
authorized
by
any
prior
decision
of
the
court.
finally,
let
me
suggest
that
any
construction
that
the
materials
can
be
imported
for
personal
use
against
the
will
of
congress,
though
not
for
commercial
purposes,
is
not
only
unsupported
by
anything
in
the
constitution,
but
is
too
illusory
and
(inaudible)
a
distinction
to
be
erected
into
constitutional
terms.
how
is
fact
of
personal
use
to
be
determined?
is
the
importer's
statement
to
be
conclusive
either
legally
or
as
a
practical
matter?
how
binding
is
the
claimant's
assertion
on
him?
how
long
must
the
intention
last?
what
happens
when
it
changes?
how
in
the
ordinary
case
can
the
government
counter
the
assertion
of
the
importer,
that
his
importation
is
for
private
purposes?
of
course,
if
he
brings
in
a
bale
of
duplicate
copies,
it
will
look
like
a
commercial
importation,
but
the
sophisticated
will
not
do
that.
with
the
ready
availability
of
duplicating
machinery
these
days,
a
single
copy
suffices
to
make
possible
wide-scale
distribution.
how
can
the
government,
as
a
practical
matter
police
this?
what
happens
if
the
importer
for
private
use
dies
or
goes
bankrupt?
can
his
trustee
in
bankruptcy
sell
the
material
along
with
the
rest
of
bankrupt's
valuable
library
on
the
ground
that
it
was
lawfully
imported,
indeed,
constitutionally
imported
for
private
use
and
if
not,
why
not?
suppose
the
importer
for
private
use
tires
of
the
material,
can
he
give
it
to
a
friend
or
perhaps
sell
it
for
a
good
price
after
a
decent
interval
has
elapsed
since
the
importation,
if
not,
again,
why
not?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
cover
the?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
reidel
case
is
the
transportation
through
the
mails.
there
nothing
in
the
reidel
case
that
has
anything
to
do
with
a
simple
sale
and
delivery.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
reidel
was
a
--
it
involved
a
prosecution
under
a
statute
which
makes
it
a
crime
to
transmit
through
the
mails
and
as
far
as
i
know
that's
the
only
thing
that
was
there
decided.
i
don't
know
of
any
federal
basis
for
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
a
simple
transfer
between
man
and
man
of
obscene
or
other
material
wholly
within
a
state
not
involving
interstate
commerce
or
the
use
of
the
mails.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
this
is
i
think
it's
exactly
my
point,
that
once
this
material
is
admitted
on
the
ground
that
it
is
for
private
use,
there
is
no
way
that
i
know
of
by
which
that
can
be
controlled
or
a
change
in
the
importer
for
private
use
decide
that
he's
tired
of
it
and
he
would
like
to
sell
it
indeed,
or
give
it
way.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
might
be
under
state
law,
but
the
federal
government
would
have
to
rely
on
state
law,
and
i
suggest
that
a
restriction
on
such
a
sale
couldn't
be
found
in
the
first
amendment
and
i
don't
know
where
else
it
could
be
found.
are
we
not
reading
too
much
into
the
first
amendment
when
we
get
into
this
area
at
all?
is
it
not
sounder
to
say
that
the
first
amendment
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case
since
as
this
court
has
said
and
reaffirmed
not
long
ago,
obscenity
is
not
within
the
area
of
constitutionally
protected
speech
or
press
and
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
this
court.
this
case
and
the
following
one
are
here
on
re-argument.
unfortunately,
neither
involves
any
factual
question
about
obscenity.
each
case
involves
a
construction
or
application
of
the
constitution
or
of
the
statutes
of
the
united
states
alone.
this
case
is
a
customs
forfeiture
proceeding
and
brought
under
section
1305
of
title
19
of
the
united
states
code.
as
the
court
will
recall
that
is
in
form
and
in
rem
proceeding
against
certain
articles
which
were
found
in
the
customs
and
it
was
begun
by
the
filing
of
a
complaint
for
forfeiture
by
the
united
states
attorney,
that
appears
on
pages
2
and
3
of
the
appendix.
the
procedure
was
apparently
somewhat
informal
or
the
appendix
is
incomplete.
no
motion
to
dismiss
appears
in
the
appendix
and
as
far
as
can
be
told
from
the
appendix,
the
owner
of
the
materials,
never
had
a
lawyer.
he
apparently
dealt
with
someone
in
the
united
states
attorney’s
office.
the
next
thing
we
know
is
an
order
of
dismissal
which
appears
on
page
5
of
the
appendix
where
judge
ferguson
said
that
the
case
depends
upon
section
1305
with
further
appearing
that
a
three-judge
court
in
united
states
v.
thirty-seven
photographs,
determine
that
section
1305
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face
and
it
further
appearing
that
this
court
ought
to
abide
by
that
decision
pending
its
responsible
review
in
the
united
states
supreme
court
it
is
ordered
that
the
action
is
dismissed.
thus,
the
decision
depends
upon
a
determination
that
section
1305
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face,
a
determination
which
this
court
has
subsequently
rejected
in
this
court’s
decision
in
thirty-seven
photographs
which
reverse
the
district
court
in
california
and
is
reported
in
402
us.
up
to
that
point,
there
are
no
facts.
there
never
was
a
trial.
there
was,
however,
a
motion
by
the
united
states
attorney
to
stay
the
order
of
dismissal
which
would
have
resulted
in
turning
the
items
which
are
called
the
defendants
over
to
the
claimant.
and
there
was
in
connection
with
that
file
an
affidavit
by
the
claimant
which
appears
on
page
9.
i
can
only
surmise,
but
i
find
myself
with
a
feeling
that
it
was
probably
written
by
an
assistant
united
states
attorney
in
cooperation
with
the
claimant
because
the
claimant
has
not
had
counsel.
and
in
the
affidavit,
the
claimant
says
that
none
of
the
defendants
were
imported
by
me
for
any
commercial
purpose
but
were
intended
to
be
used
and
possessed
by
me
personally
and
in
the
motion
to
stay
the
order
of
dismissal,
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
on
page
7
of
the
records
says,
“the
court
is
further
advised
that
the
plaintiff
has
no
evidence
with
which
to
contradict
mr.
paladini’s
affidavit
and
therefore
does
not
contest
the
fact
that
this
was
a
private
importation”
and
that
is
the
basis
upon
which
the
case
is
here.
it
is
thus,
purely
a
question
of
construing
and
applying
the
first
amendment
with
respect
to
articles
which
are
considered
to
be
obscene
for
the
purpose
of
the
case
because
the
forfeiture
was
ordered
dismissed,
because
the
statute
was
held
to
be
unconstitutional
on
its
face
that
could
have
been
only
under
an
application
of
the
first
amendment,
and
so
we
are
confronted
here
with
an
almost
pure
question
of
the
construction
and
application
of
the
first
amendment.
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
think
of
it
in
terms
of
construing
the
first
amendment
because
i
can
find
nothing
in
the
first
amendment
that
seems
to
deal
with
that.
congress
shall
make
no
law
abridging
the
freedom
of
speech
or
of
the
press.
now,
i
think
we
can
put
the
speech
aside.
no
one
is
undertaking
to
speak.
no
one
has
spoken.
no
one
is
being
told
that
he
cannot
speak
anything
he
wants.
with
respect
to
the
press,
there
is
no
prior
restraint.
no
one
is
stopping
the
presses.
it
has
never
been
supposed
that
the
first
amendment
prevents
legal
action
with
respect
to
the
product
of
the
press
in
cases
where
that
is
warranted.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
no,
mr.
justice.
i
think
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
the
first
amendment
is
applicable
with
respect
to
any
action
by
officers
of
the
united
states.
the
fact
that
they
were
printed
abroad,
we
don’t
even
know
that
they
were
printed
abroad.
they
may
have
been
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
re-imported.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
all
of
them
are
forms
of
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
they
are
reels
of
film
and
printed
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
they
are
forms
of
expression
but
no
one
is
abridging
the
freedom
of
the
press
here.
no
one
is
seeking
to
prevent
the
printing
of
material.
they
are
seeking
to
prevent
the
importation
of
material,
but
that
is
not
preventing
the
printing
of
material.
but
let
me
move
to
the
next
aspect
of
the
argument.
actually,
i
suppose
this
case
turns
entirely
on
the
meaning
and
application
of
four
decisions
of
this
court.
there
are
of
course,
a
good
many
others
which
are
in
the
area,
but
above
the
four
are
the
roth
case
decided
in
1957,
stanley
and
georgia
decided
in
1969,
united
states
against
reidel
decided
in
1971,
and
united
states
against
thirty-seven
photographs
also
decided
in
1971.
the
first
of
those
is
the
roth
case
and
i
believe
there
are
only
two
members
of
the
court
now
sitting
who
participated
in
that
case.
the
roth
case
refers
the
opinion
of
justice
brennan.
it
refers
to
the
universal
judgment
that
obscenity
should
be
restrained,
reflected
in
the
international
agreement
of
over
50
nations
in
the
obscenity
laws
of
all
the
48
states,
and
then
the
twenty
obscenity
laws
enacted
by
the
congress
from
1842
to
1956
and
continues.
this
is
the
same
judgment
expressed
by
this
court
in
chaplinsky
against
new
hampshire
where
the
court
said
that
there
are
certain
well
defined
and
narrowly
limited
classes
of
speech;
the
prevention
and
punishment
of
which
have
never
been
thought
to
raise
any
constitutional
problem.
these
include
the
lewd
and
obscene.
it
has
been
well
observed
that
such
utterances
are
no
essential
part
of
any
exposition
of
ideas,
that
was
why
i
was
a
little
hesitant
in
answering
your
question.
and
are
such
slight
social
value
as
step
to
truth
that
any
benefit
that
may
be
derived
from
them
is
clearly
outweighed
by
the
social
interest
in
order
and
morality
and
then
follows
the
key
sentence.
we
hold
that
obscenity
is
not
within
the
area
of
constitutionally
protected
speech
or
press.
now,
that
sentence,
which
has,
of
course
been
quoted
many
times
since,
but
if
these
materials
which
are
conceded
to
be
obscene
on
this
record
are
not
within
the
area
of
constitutionally
protected
freedom
of
speech
and
press,
this
is
not
a
first
amendment
case.
now
that
case
was
15
years
ago,
a
lot
of
waters
gone
over
the
dam.
this
is
an
extremely
difficult
area
in
which
there
have
been
sharp
differences
of
opinion,
but
through
it
all,
roth
and
that
passage
have
survived
and
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
see
in
1972
if
the
court’s
position
is
that
obscenity
is
not
within
the
constitutionally
protected
area
of
freedom
of
speech
and
the
press,
that
there
is
any
first
amendment
problem
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice,
because
in
stanley
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
all
that
we
on
this
side
of
the
bark
and
do
mr.
justice
is
to
try
to
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i
would
think
that
the
way
to
combine
stanley
with
roth
would
be
to
say
that
stanley
is
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
understand
that
mr.
justice
and
–-
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
am
well
aware.
i
have
counted
very
carefully
connecting
with
this
fate.
the
only
way
that
i
can
combine,
i
did
not
say
reconcile
roth
and
stanley
is
to
limit
to
its
facts
namely
the
privacy
of
the
home,
a
fact
which
was
repeatedly
referred
to
in
the
opinion
in
stanley
that
when
a
man
is
in
his
home
he
can
have
there
things
which
are
beyond
the
power
of
the
state
to
seize
or
interfere
with.
i
have
some
trouble
finding
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i
did
not
expect
to
accept
this
reconciliation
of
stanley
and
roth.
i've
my
own
private
view.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
and
may
i
say
so
with
respect
on
the
fourth
amendment.
there
is
a
great
deal
of
talk
about
the
first
amendment
in
stanley.
the
dissenting
opinions
or
concurring
opinions
rested
it
on
the
fourth
amendment.
i
find
it
quite
easy
to
handle
the
two
cases
on
that
basis.
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
find
consistency
between
roth
and
the
statement
in
stanley
opinion.
roth
and
the
cases
following
that
decision
are
not
impaired
by
today’s
holding.
now,
they
are
certainly
are
impaired
as
to
the
privacy
of
the
man’s
home
and
if
that
sentence
had
said
except
with
respect
to
the
privacy
of
a
man’s
home,
roth
and
the
cases
following
that
decision
are
not
impaired
by
today’s
holding,
i
could
follow
it
better.
the
statement
however,
made
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
was
quite
unqualified.
and
then
we
have
year-and-a-half
ago,
united
stated
against
reidel
where
five
members
of
the
court
concurred
in
a
majority
opinion.
mr.
justice
harlan
filed
a
concurring
opinion
and
three
members
of
the
court
dissented.
but
in
reidel,
the
majority
and
may
i
say
with
respect
including
mr.
stewart
joined
in
the
statement.
roth
has
not
been
overruled.
it
remains
the
law
in
this
court
and
governs
this
case.
and
if
the
law
is
that
obscenity
and
the
materials
in
this
case
are
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
obscene
is
not
protected
by
the
first
amendment
that
would
seem
to
dispose
of
the
case
and
it
went
on
to
say,
but
it
neither
overruled
nor
disturbed
the
holding
in
roth.
and
then
quoted
the
language
from
roth
which
i
have
given
and
reversed
the
district
court
in
that
case
by
saying
that
the
district
court
gave
stanley
too
wide
a
sweep.
and
finally,
the
court
said
on
page
356,
“but
roth
has
squarely
placed
obscenity
and
this
is
a
majority
of
the
court,
roth
has
squarely
placed
obscenity
in
its
distribution
outside
the
reach
of
the
first
amendment
and
they
remained
there
today.
stanley
did
not
overrule
roth
and
we
decline
to
do
so
now.”
and
then
at
the
very
close
of
the
opinion
it
says
that
these
matters
remain
within
state
power,
roth
and
like
cases
posed
no
obstacle
to
such
developments.
now,
mr.
justice
harlan
concurred
and
justices
marshall,
black
and
douglas
dissented.
immediately
following
that
decision,
there
was
decided
united
states
against
thirty-seven
photographs,
where
as
you
will
recall
there
were
two
questions,
one
might
be
called
the
time
question,
the
question
of
the
speed
with
which
the
government
can
operate
in
this
and
there
was
a
clear
majority
on
that
issue
and
we
are
endeavoring
to
carry
out
that
determination
of
the
court,
but
then
the
court
went
on
and
--
to
decide
to
further
questions.
one
with
respect
to
the
fact
that
the
district
court
in
thirty-seven
photographs
had
ruled
in
favor
of
the
defendant
even
though
the
importation
there
was
for
commercial
purposes.
on
the
ground
that
the
statute
was
over
broad
because
it
was
also
applicable
to
a
private
importation.
and
if
the
statute
was
over
broad
then
it
was
unconstitutional
and
then
it
fell
as
to
commercial
importation
too.
and
a
total
of
six
members
of
the
court
joined
in
saying
that
that
application
of
the
statute
was
wrong.
that
the
statute
was
valid
as
applied
to
commercial
importation.
but
only
four
members
of
the
court
joined
in
a
plurality
opinion
with
respect
to
whether
a
private
importation
was
covered
by
the
statute.
that
opinion
by
mr.
justice
white
is
again
in
strong
terms,
reiterates
roth.
holds
roth
fully
applicable
and
then
we
come
to
mr.
justice
stewart’s
opinion
which
made
up
one
of
the
six,
along
with
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
justice
stewart
turning
to
the
private
aspect
of
the
importation
says,
“but
i
would
not
decide,
would
not
in
this
case
decide
even
by
way
of
dicta
that
the
government
may
lawfully
seize
literary
material
intended
for
the
purely
private
use
of
the
importer.”
and
then
he
goes
to
give
his
own
private
dictum
as
i
read
it,
perhaps
wrong,
“that
it
would
be
invalid
as
applied
to
a
private
importer.”
he
concludes,
“if
the
government
can
constitutionally
take
the
book
away
from
him
as
he
passes
through
customs”
then
i
do
not
understand
the
meaning
of
stanley
v.
georgia
and
i
can
only
say
mr.
justice
that
i
don't
understand
the
meaning
of
stanley
v.
georgia
particularly
in
the
light
of
its
treatment
in
the
subsequent
cases.
and
so
we
come
to
the
question
on
which
a
majority
of
the
court
has
not
yet
spoken
whether
an
importation
for
private
purposes
is
in
some
way
which
i
find
hard
to
follow
brought
within
the
language
of
the
first
amendment
or
is
within
the
decision
of
the
court
in
stanley
against
georgia
as
that
case
has
been
explained
in
the
case
itself
and
in
the
two
subsequent
cases
of
reidel
and
thirty-seven
photographs.
now,
surely
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution
about
a
distinction
between
private
and
commercial
with
respect
to
the
application
of
the
first
amendment.
surely
the
first
amendment
applies
to
commercial
publication.
after
all
our
newspapers
have
always
been
commercial.
our
television
networks
are
one
of
the
greatest
commercial
activities
in
the
country
where
very
large
sums
are
made
by
use
of
public
facilities
resulting
among
other
things
in
very
high
cost
for
election
campaigns.
i
don’t
disparage
the
slightest
the
business
of
the
newspapers
or
of
the
television.
i
simply
point
out
that
a
distinction
between
public
and
private
with
respect
to
the
first
amendment
is
between
commercial
and
private
with
respect
to
the
first
amendment
is
one
which
finds
no
application
or
support
in
any
other
area
and
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
see
why
it
should
hear.
moreover,
if
as
the
court
has
not
only
decided,
but
has
reiterated
in
recent
time,
obscenity
is
not
within
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment.
i
cannot
see
how
it
makes
any
difference
whether
it
is
commercial
or
private.
at
least,
as
long
as
it
not
in
the
privacy
of
the
home
which
is
the
area
which
was
involved
in
stanley.
and
any
application
of
stanley
broader
than
that
is
certainly
not
a
decision
in
that
case,
but
is
a
dictum
of
some
sort
which
has
not
met
full
support
from
the
court
in
subsequent
decisions.
now,
there
are
references
in
other
cases
to
penumbras
of
the
first
amendment.
i
recognize
that
the
first
amendment
ought
not
to
be
construed
in
strictly
literal
terms.
i
have
even
contended
here
that
no
law
does
not
mean
no
law
and
that
still
seems
to
me
to
be
in
some
applications
a
sound
argument.
similarly,
the
first
amendment
need
not
be
construed
literally
in
its
broader
application.
but
a
penumbra
i
am
told
is
an
area
of
partial
darkness
between
the
light
and
total
darkness.
it
is
also
a
realm
of
great
uncertainty
where
the
conclusions,
i
would
suggest
with
great
respect,
are
not
found
in
the
constitution,
but
are
found
in
the
minds
of
the
person
who
is
writing
about
the
particular
problem.
i
find
it
extremely
difficult
to
see
how
it
is
appropriate
to
extend,
i
won’t
say
the
constitution,
but
to
extend
the
application
of
the
constitution
to
a
matter
which
for
a
century
and
three
quarters
has
been
regarded
as
within
the
complete
control
of
congress
the
--
under
its
power
to
regulate
foreign
commerce
the
importation
of
items
into
the
united
states.
the
mere
fact
that
it
is
private
does
not
seem
to
me
to
justify
the
conclusion
that
congress
cannot
regulate
the
importation.
that
would
be
equally
true
of
narcotics
or
explosives
or
other
material
which
a
person
might
want
to
bring
in
on
his
person,
a
diamond
ring
or
something
else
that
he
had
acquired
abroad.
he
is
subject
not
only
to
having
to
declare
those
and
pay
duty
on
them,
but
in
certain
cases
to
be
searched
and
to
have
the
property
seized.
the
mere
fact
that
it
is
private
does
not
seem
to
me
to
support
it.
the
fact
that
it
is
in
print
doesn’t
seem
to
me
to
help
any
at
least
if
there
is
any
vitality
to
the
repeatedly
re-declared
statement
in
roth
that
obscenity
is
not
within
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment.
that
decision
in
roth
seems
to
me
to
be
sound
at
the
time.
the
court
has
taken
occasion
in
a
number
of
decisions
to
reiterate
its
support
for
that
decision
in
roth
and
that
seems
to
me
to
be
sufficient
to
disclose
of
this
case.
accordingly,
we
urge
that
the
judgment
below
be
reversed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i
cannot
answer
that.
i
think
that
though
this
statute
was
enacted
in
1938
it
had
predecessors
and
that
full
legislative
history
would
be
long
and
complicated
and
i
cannot
give
it
to
you.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
would
like
to
make
only
two
points
in
rebuttal.
the
argument
that
there
is
a
right
to
receive
and
that
this
supports
the
distribution
of
material
was
in
essence
the
heard
argument
in
the
reidel
case
and
was
the
argument
which
was
rejected
by
a
majority
of
the
court
there.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
was
undertaking
simply
to
support
senator
kuchel’s
concession
on
that
to
refer
specifically
to
the
reidel
case
which
decided
that
i
believe
and
also
to
the
decision
of
the
court
per
curium
in
gable
against
jenkins
397
us
592
decided
shortly
after
the
stanley
case
in
which
the
power
of
the
state
of
georgia
to
regulate
the
dissemination
of
such
material
was
expressly
confirmed.
the
other
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
i
think
that
for
practical
purposes
the
distinction
between
private
and
commercial
in
this
area
is
illusory.
it
is
appealing
in
a
sense,
of
course,
in
the
sense
that
led
to
stanley
and
georgia,
the
freedom
of
a
man’s
mind
to
think
what
he
wants
to
think.
but
there
is
no
practical
way
to
deal
with
a
decision
which
says
that
if
the
matter
is
private
it
can
be
imported,
but
if
it
is
commercial
it
can’t
be
imported.
the
only
thing
that
you
could
go
by
would
be
the
man’s
own
statement
plus
perhaps
the
quantities
of
materials
imported
and
here
there
was
a
very
substantial
quantity.
it
is
one
thing
to
say
it
is
in
his
luggage,
it
is
in
his
pocket,
it
is
in
his
home
but
how
are
you
going
to
keep
them
there?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
is
stipulated
that
he
claims
that
they
are
for
private
purposes
and
that
the
government
has
no
evidence
to
the
contrary.
how
would
the
government
ever
have
any
evidence
to
the
contrary
at
point
in
importation?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
can
accept
and
recognize
that
there
would
be
certain
cases
when
it
would
be
possible
to
do
that.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
then
what?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
would
not
be
at
least
any
crime
under
any
existing
law
if
he
then
sold
it.
moreover
by
the
time
he
has
sold
it,
it
is
in
the
extreme
of
commerce
and
the
purpose
of
congress
in
trying
to
keep
such
materials
out
has
been
entirely
frustrated.
i
simply
repeat
that
it
is
not
practical.
a
decision
that
things
can
be
imported
by
a
person,
does
it
have
to
be
in
his
luggage
accompanying
him
or
can
he
ship
it
in
as
he
comes
in
or
can
he
ship
it
in
while
he
is
abroad
in
order
to
have
it
home
when
he
gets
there?
how
would
any
one,
how
would
custom's
officers,
officers
of
the
government
endeavoring
honestly
to
comply
with
the
decisions
of
the
court
deal
with
it
is
a
practical
matter.
i
submit
that
to
decide
that
it
can
be
imported
for
private
purposes
is
in
effect
to
overrule
the
consequences
of
thirty-seven
photographs
which
the
court
decided
last
term.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
here
on
appeal
from
the
central
district
court
of
california,
which
held
unconstitutional
an
act
of
congress
providing
for
the
forfeiture
of
obscene
material
imported
into
the
united
states.
this
present
case
and
the
one
which
follows
are
sequels
to
the
decisions
of
the
court
last
term
in
united
states
against
reidel
and
united
states
against
thirty-seven
photographs.
those
cases
involved
transmissions
through
the
mails
and
importation
of
obscene
materials
for
commercial
purposes.
the
distinctive
feature
of
this
case
is
that
the
importation
here
is
alleged
to
be
for
private
use.
the
present
proceeding
is
an
in
rem
proceeding
against
a
number
of
items
which
were
imported
by
the
claimant.
some
of
those
have
been
returned
to
the
claimant
as
not
obscene.
the
others
are
on
file
at
the
court.
i
believe
it
can
be
said
that
if
anything
is
obscene,
these
items
are
and
particularly
the
printed
material.
these
in
my
view
are
not
borderline
materials.
if
the
court
is
disposed
to
hold
that
there
is
nothing
that
can
be
held
to
be
obscene
under
the
constitution,
that
will
dispose
of
this
case.
but
if
obscenity
still
has
any
constitutional
meaning,
then
i
believe
that
these
materials
would
have
to
be
found
to
be
obscene
by
any
standard
which
has
ever
been
suggested
by
the
court.
when
the
complaint
for
forfeiture
came
on
to
be
heard,
the
district
court
granted
a
motion
to
dismiss,
relying
on
the
prior
decision
of
the
same
court
in
the
thirty-seven
photographs
case,
the
one
which
was
reversed
last
term.
at
that
time
the
claimant
filed
an
affidavit,
stating
that
the
items
were
not,
and
i
quote
“were
not
imported
by
me
for
any
commercial
purpose,
but
were
intended
to
be
used
and
possessed
by
me
personally.”
and
in
response
to
the
united
states
attorney
filed
a
motion
for
a
stay
of
the
order
of
dismissal
in
which
he
stated
that
the
united
states
had
and
again
i
quote,
“no
evidence
with
which
to
contradict
mr.
paladini’s
affidavit
and
therefore
does
not
confess
the
fact
that
this
was
a
private
importation.”
there
are
at
least
two
lines
of
reasoning
on
which
the
government’s
case
maybe
rested.
in
the
first
place,
if
these
materials
are
obscene
as
i
have
contended
or
if
they
must
be
regarded
as
obscene,
since
the
court
below
has
rendered
a
motion
to
dismiss
without
determining
the
question
of
obscenity,
then
the
materials
are
not
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment
and
that
would
seem
to
dispose
off
the
matter
since
no
fourth
amendment
question
is
involved.
nearly
15
years
ago
in
roth,
this
court
decided
that
obscenity
is
not
within
the
area
of
constitutionally
protected
speech
or
press.
there
is
nothing
in
this
court’s
subsequent
decisions
to
indicate
that
this
is
still
not
the
law
and
quite
the
contrary.
in
stanley
against
georgia
which
is
the
basis
of
the
decision
of
the
court
below,
this
court
said
roth
and
the
cases
following
that
decision
are
not
impaired
by
today’s
holding,
that
was
in
1969.
in
last
term
in
reidel,
the
court
quoted
the
language
from
roth
and
said,
roth
has
not
been
overruled,
it
remains
the
law
in
this
court
and
governs
this
case.
in
thirty-seven
photographs
decided
the
same
day,
mr.
justice
white
speaking
for
four
members
of
the
court,
reiterated
the
statement
that
obscenity
is
not
within
the
scope
of
first
amendment’s
protection.
if
this
material
is
obscene
by
any
standard
as
i
have
contended
and
if
obscenity
is
not
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
then
it
would
seem
to
follow
that
there
is
no
constitutional
basis.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
that
is
correct.
i
am
simply
saying
that
they
are
obscene,
but
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice,
that
is
the
question,
but
i
don't
think
that
question
can
be
escaped
by
examining
the
material
and
saying
it
is
not
obscene
and
that
is
the
--
for
example,
blank
pieces
of
paper
and
this
is
not
a
framed
issue,
this
is
a
real
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
that
is
accurate
mr.
justice,
except
that
i
think
that
these
materials
are
obscene.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
not
to
assume
that
they
are
obscene.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
or
if
you
say
that
obscenity
is
not
relevant
in
the
case,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
should
not
be
disposed
of
on
ground
that
obscenity
has
not
been
established.
another
approach
leads
to
the
same
result.
stanley
against
georgia
held
that
obscene
material
seized
in
a
man’s
library
in
his
home
under
a
search
warrant,
authorizing
a
search
for
evidence
of
gambling
materials
could
not
be
made
the
basis
of
a
criminal
prosecution
for
possessing
the
obscene
items.
i
find
no
basis
for
objecting
to
the
result,
though
as
i
contended
last
week
in
counselman
against
hitchcock,
some
of
the
language
used
may
have
been
unnecessarily
broad.
as
it
was
pointed
out
by
the
three
concurring
justices
in
that
case,
the
decision
is
perhaps
best
rested
on
the
fourth
amendment
as
an
illegal
search,
not
adequately
supported
by
the
warrant
which
the
officers
had
obtained.
but
on
that
basis,
it
is
not
a
first
amendment
case
and
has
no
application
here.
this
is
borne
out
by
the
court’s
decision
in
the
reidel
and
thirty-seven
photographs
cases.
the
reidel
decision
held
that
the
rationale
of
stanley
was
not
sufficient
to
bar
a
prosecution
of
a
person
who
on
a
commercial
basis
mailed
obscene
material
to
a
recipient
at
his
home.
though
stanley
had
referred
to
the
right
to
receive
information
and
ideas,
this
right
for
receive
was
not
sufficient
to
allow
the
recipient
to
obtain
obscene
material
through
the
mails
from
a
commercial
mailer
as
against
the
right
of
the
united
states,
constitutionally
to
forbid
its
passage
through
to
the
mails.
and
in
thirty-seven
photographs,
this
conclusion
was
reached
with
respect
to
obscene
material,
a
single
set
of
37
photographs
which
an
individual
had
acquired
abroad
and
sought
to
bring
into
the
united
states
through
customs
with
a
view
to
using
them
in
a
commercial
publication.
as
indicated
by
my
response
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
question,
the
sole
difference
between
this
case
and
thirty-seven
photographs,
is
that
here
the
importation
is
allegedly
to
be
for
the
personal
use
of
the
importer,
and
we
have
no
evidence
to
the
contrary.
in
view
of
reidel
however,
that
would
seem
to
be
a
distinction
without
a
difference.
if
a
person
cannot
have
things
mailed
to
him
without
causing
the
mailer
to
commit
a
crime,
it
is
rather
hard
to
see
that
he
should
be
able
to
bring
things
into
the
country
himself
as
against
the
“broad
and
sweeping”
powers
of
congress
to
regulate
foreign
commerce
and
the
traditional
comprehensive
power
of
this
and
all
other
nations
over
all
materials
entering
the
country
at
the
borders.
now
this
was
the
view
of
the
four
justices
constituting
the
plurality
in
thirty-seven
photographs.
they
said
in
thirty-seven
photographs,
the
trial
court
erred
in
reading
stanley
as
immunizing
from
seizure,
obscene
materials
possessed
at
a
port
of
entry
for
the
purpose
of
importations
for
private
use.
and
then
obscene
material
maybe
removed
in
the
channels
of
commerce
when
discovered
in
the
luggage
of
a
returning
foreign
traveler,
even
though
intended
solely
for
his
private
use
and
the
finally,
a
port
of
entry
is
not
a
traveler's
home.
as
i
have
contended
the
first
amendment
does
not
apply
since
the
material
is
obscene
or
must
be
taken
as
obscene
and
it
is
no
less
obscene,
because
it
is
imported
to
private
use.
the
court
would
not
hold
i
suppose
that
a
person
who
would
lawfully
bring
in
narcotics
or
a
hand
grenade
on
the
ground
that
he
was
going
to
use
the
narcotics
or
the
hand
grenade
personally.
i
know
of
no
basis
on
which
it
can
be
determined,
either
under
the
first
amendment
or
otherwise
that
personal
use
provides
some
sort
of
a
protection
against
otherwise
applicable
laws.
now
i
suppose
if
the
court
hold
is
a
person
can
import
foreign
credit
book,
which
violates
an
american
copyright
on
the
ground
that
he
is
going
to
use
the
book
himself.
i
well
remember
the
(inaudible)
editions
of
american
books,
which
we
used
to
buy
in
europe
a
generation
ago,
and
there
a
clear
statement
that
they
could
not
be
imported
into
the
united
states
under
the
copyright
laws.
i've
read
a
farewell
to
arms
in
a
(inaudible)
edition
and
took
care
to
have
it
finished
before
i
came
home,
perhaps
this
was
unnecessary,
if
the
decision
below
is
sound,
but
i
did
not
think
so
then.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
was
before
stanley
was
decided,
but
this
is
the
same
constitution
mr.
justice
and
the
same
for
first
amendment.
congress
has
sweeping
power
at
our
borders
though
its
power
to
regulate
foreign
commerce,
not
power
of
course
to
violate
the
constitution,
but
power
under
the
constitution
to
regulate
foreign
commerce
in
terms
which
are
not
qualified
by
the
constitutional
provision
itself.
i
can
find
nothing
in
the
terms
of
the
first
amendment,
which
limits
the
power
of
congress
to
bar
the
importation
of
obscene
materials,
even
when
they
are
intended
for
private
use.
it
can
be
done,
i
suggest,
only
by
erecting
a
very
substantial
penumbra
around
the
first
amendment
extending
quite
far
beyond
its
terms
and
beyond
the
privacy
of
the
home
or
the
person
which
were
involved
in
the
stanley
case
and
in
griswold
against
connecticut.
such
an
extension
is
not
warranted
by
any
constitutional
precedent
or
standard
that
i
know
of.
if
it
were
done,
it
is
hard
to
tell
how
the
limits
of
the
penumbra
could
be
determined.
it
would
be
i
suppose
whatever
this
court
thinks
it
should
be.
of
course,
constitutional
improvisations
cannot
always
be
interpreted
literally,
but
finding
support
in
the
first
amendment
for
the
result
reached
by
the
court
below
would
carry
the
court
farther
way
from
the
constitutional
language,
i
submit,
than
the
court
ought
to
go,
and
farther
away
from
the
language
than
is
required
or
authorized
by
any
prior
decision
of
the
court.
finally,
let
me
suggest
that
any
construction
that
the
materials
can
be
imported
for
personal
use
against
the
will
of
congress,
though
not
for
commercial
purposes,
is
not
only
unsupported
by
anything
in
the
constitution,
but
is
too
illusory
and
(inaudible)
a
distinction
to
be
erected
into
constitutional
terms.
how
is
fact
of
personal
use
to
be
determined?
is
the
importer's
statement
to
be
conclusive
either
legally
or
as
a
practical
matter?
how
binding
is
the
claimant's
assertion
on
him?
how
long
must
the
intention
last?
what
happens
when
it
changes?
how
in
the
ordinary
case
can
the
government
counter
the
assertion
of
the
importer,
that
his
importation
is
for
private
purposes?
of
course,
if
he
brings
in
a
bale
of
duplicate
copies,
it
will
look
like
a
commercial
importation,
but
the
sophisticated
will
not
do
that.
with
the
ready
availability
of
duplicating
machinery
these
days,
a
single
copy
suffices
to
make
possible
wide-scale
distribution.
how
can
the
government,
as
a
practical
matter
police
this?
what
happens
if
the
importer
for
private
use
dies
or
goes
bankrupt?
can
his
trustee
in
bankruptcy
sell
the
material
along
with
the
rest
of
bankrupt's
valuable
library
on
the
ground
that
it
was
lawfully
imported,
indeed,
constitutionally
imported
for
private
use
and
if
not,
why
not?
suppose
the
importer
for
private
use
tires
of
the
material,
can
he
give
it
to
a
friend
or
perhaps
sell
it
for
a
good
price
after
a
decent
interval
has
elapsed
since
the
importation,
if
not,
again,
why
not?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
cover
the?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
reidel
case
is
the
transportation
through
the
mails.
there
nothing
in
the
reidel
case
that
has
anything
to
do
with
a
simple
sale
and
delivery.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
reidel
was
a
--
it
involved
a
prosecution
under
a
statute
which
makes
it
a
crime
to
transmit
through
the
mails
and
as
far
as
i
know
that's
the
only
thing
that
was
there
decided.
i
don't
know
of
any
federal
basis
for
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
a
simple
transfer
between
man
and
man
of
obscene
or
other
material
wholly
within
a
state
not
involving
interstate
commerce
or
the
use
of
the
mails.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
this
is
i
think
it's
exactly
my
point,
that
once
this
material
is
admitted
on
the
ground
that
it
is
for
private
use,
there
is
no
way
that
i
know
of
by
which
that
can
be
controlled
or
a
change
in
the
importer
for
private
use
decide
that
he's
tired
of
it
and
he
would
like
to
sell
it
indeed,
or
give
it
way.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
might
be
under
state
law,
but
the
federal
government
would
have
to
rely
on
state
law,
and
i
suggest
that
a
restriction
on
such
a
sale
couldn't
be
found
in
the
first
amendment
and
i
don't
know
where
else
it
could
be
found.
are
we
not
reading
too
much
into
the
first
amendment
when
we
get
into
this
area
at
all?
is
it
not
sounder
to
say
that
the
first
amendment
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case
since
as
this
court
has
said
and
reaffirmed
not
long
ago,
obscenity
is
not
within
the
area
of
constitutionally
protected
speech
or
press
and
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
this
court.
this
case
and
the
following
one
are
here
on
re-argument.
unfortunately,
neither
involves
any
factual
question
about
obscenity.
each
case
involves
a
construction
or
application
of
the
constitution
or
of
the
statutes
of
the
united
states
alone.
this
case
is
a
customs
forfeiture
proceeding
and
brought
under
section
1305
of
title
19
of
the
united
states
code.
as
the
court
will
recall
that
is
in
form
and
in
rem
proceeding
against
certain
articles
which
were
found
in
the
customs
and
it
was
begun
by
the
filing
of
a
complaint
for
forfeiture
by
the
united
states
attorney,
that
appears
on
pages
2
and
3
of
the
appendix.
the
procedure
was
apparently
somewhat
informal
or
the
appendix
is
incomplete.
no
motion
to
dismiss
appears
in
the
appendix
and
as
far
as
can
be
told
from
the
appendix,
the
owner
of
the
materials,
never
had
a
lawyer.
he
apparently
dealt
with
someone
in
the
united
states
attorney’s
office.
the
next
thing
we
know
is
an
order
of
dismissal
which
appears
on
page
5
of
the
appendix
where
judge
ferguson
said
that
the
case
depends
upon
section
1305
with
further
appearing
that
a
three-judge
court
in
united
states
v.
thirty-seven
photographs,
determine
that
section
1305
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face
and
it
further
appearing
that
this
court
ought
to
abide
by
that
decision
pending
its
responsible
review
in
the
united
states
supreme
court
it
is
ordered
that
the
action
is
dismissed.
thus,
the
decision
depends
upon
a
determination
that
section
1305
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face,
a
determination
which
this
court
has
subsequently
rejected
in
this
court’s
decision
in
thirty-seven
photographs
which
reverse
the
district
court
in
california
and
is
reported
in
402
us.
up
to
that
point,
there
are
no
facts.
there
never
was
a
trial.
there
was,
however,
a
motion
by
the
united
states
attorney
to
stay
the
order
of
dismissal
which
would
have
resulted
in
turning
the
items
which
are
called
the
defendants
over
to
the
claimant.
and
there
was
in
connection
with
that
file
an
affidavit
by
the
claimant
which
appears
on
page
9.
i
can
only
surmise,
but
i
find
myself
with
a
feeling
that
it
was
probably
written
by
an
assistant
united
states
attorney
in
cooperation
with
the
claimant
because
the
claimant
has
not
had
counsel.
and
in
the
affidavit,
the
claimant
says
that
none
of
the
defendants
were
imported
by
me
for
any
commercial
purpose
but
were
intended
to
be
used
and
possessed
by
me
personally
and
in
the
motion
to
stay
the
order
of
dismissal,
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
on
page
7
of
the
records
says,
“the
court
is
further
advised
that
the
plaintiff
has
no
evidence
with
which
to
contradict
mr.
paladini’s
affidavit
and
therefore
does
not
contest
the
fact
that
this
was
a
private
importation”
and
that
is
the
basis
upon
which
the
case
is
here.
it
is
thus,
purely
a
question
of
construing
and
applying
the
first
amendment
with
respect
to
articles
which
are
considered
to
be
obscene
for
the
purpose
of
the
case
because
the
forfeiture
was
ordered
dismissed,
because
the
statute
was
held
to
be
unconstitutional
on
its
face
that
could
have
been
only
under
an
application
of
the
first
amendment,
and
so
we
are
confronted
here
with
an
almost
pure
question
of
the
construction
and
application
of
the
first
amendment.
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
think
of
it
in
terms
of
construing
the
first
amendment
because
i
can
find
nothing
in
the
first
amendment
that
seems
to
deal
with
that.
congress
shall
make
no
law
abridging
the
freedom
of
speech
or
of
the
press.
now,
i
think
we
can
put
the
speech
aside.
no
one
is
undertaking
to
speak.
no
one
has
spoken.
no
one
is
being
told
that
he
cannot
speak
anything
he
wants.
with
respect
to
the
press,
there
is
no
prior
restraint.
no
one
is
stopping
the
presses.
it
has
never
been
supposed
that
the
first
amendment
prevents
legal
action
with
respect
to
the
product
of
the
press
in
cases
where
that
is
warranted.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
no,
mr.
justice.
i
think
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
the
first
amendment
is
applicable
with
respect
to
any
action
by
officers
of
the
united
states.
the
fact
that
they
were
printed
abroad,
we
don’t
even
know
that
they
were
printed
abroad.
they
may
have
been
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
re-imported.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
all
of
them
are
forms
of
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
they
are
reels
of
film
and
printed
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
they
are
forms
of
expression
but
no
one
is
abridging
the
freedom
of
the
press
here.
no
one
is
seeking
to
prevent
the
printing
of
material.
they
are
seeking
to
prevent
the
importation
of
material,
but
that
is
not
preventing
the
printing
of
material.
but
let
me
move
to
the
next
aspect
of
the
argument.
actually,
i
suppose
this
case
turns
entirely
on
the
meaning
and
application
of
four
decisions
of
this
court.
there
are
of
course,
a
good
many
others
which
are
in
the
area,
but
above
the
four
are
the
roth
case
decided
in
1957,
stanley
and
georgia
decided
in
1969,
united
states
against
reidel
decided
in
1971,
and
united
states
against
thirty-seven
photographs
also
decided
in
1971.
the
first
of
those
is
the
roth
case
and
i
believe
there
are
only
two
members
of
the
court
now
sitting
who
participated
in
that
case.
the
roth
case
refers
the
opinion
of
justice
brennan.
it
refers
to
the
universal
judgment
that
obscenity
should
be
restrained,
reflected
in
the
international
agreement
of
over
50
nations
in
the
obscenity
laws
of
all
the
48
states,
and
then
the
twenty
obscenity
laws
enacted
by
the
congress
from
1842
to
1956
and
continues.
this
is
the
same
judgment
expressed
by
this
court
in
chaplinsky
against
new
hampshire
where
the
court
said
that
there
are
certain
well
defined
and
narrowly
limited
classes
of
speech;
the
prevention
and
punishment
of
which
have
never
been
thought
to
raise
any
constitutional
problem.
these
include
the
lewd
and
obscene.
it
has
been
well
observed
that
such
utterances
are
no
essential
part
of
any
exposition
of
ideas,
that
was
why
i
was
a
little
hesitant
in
answering
your
question.
and
are
such
slight
social
value
as
step
to
truth
that
any
benefit
that
may
be
derived
from
them
is
clearly
outweighed
by
the
social
interest
in
order
and
morality
and
then
follows
the
key
sentence.
we
hold
that
obscenity
is
not
within
the
area
of
constitutionally
protected
speech
or
press.
now,
that
sentence,
which
has,
of
course
been
quoted
many
times
since,
but
if
these
materials
which
are
conceded
to
be
obscene
on
this
record
are
not
within
the
area
of
constitutionally
protected
freedom
of
speech
and
press,
this
is
not
a
first
amendment
case.
now
that
case
was
15
years
ago,
a
lot
of
waters
gone
over
the
dam.
this
is
an
extremely
difficult
area
in
which
there
have
been
sharp
differences
of
opinion,
but
through
it
all,
roth
and
that
passage
have
survived
and
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
see
in
1972
if
the
court’s
position
is
that
obscenity
is
not
within
the
constitutionally
protected
area
of
freedom
of
speech
and
the
press,
that
there
is
any
first
amendment
problem
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice,
because
in
stanley
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
all
that
we
on
this
side
of
the
bark
and
do
mr.
justice
is
to
try
to
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i
would
think
that
the
way
to
combine
stanley
with
roth
would
be
to
say
that
stanley
is
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
understand
that
mr.
justice
and
–-
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
am
well
aware.
i
have
counted
very
carefully
connecting
with
this
fate.
the
only
way
that
i
can
combine,
i
did
not
say
reconcile
roth
and
stanley
is
to
limit
to
its
facts
namely
the
privacy
of
the
home,
a
fact
which
was
repeatedly
referred
to
in
the
opinion
in
stanley
that
when
a
man
is
in
his
home
he
can
have
there
things
which
are
beyond
the
power
of
the
state
to
seize
or
interfere
with.
i
have
some
trouble
finding
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i
did
not
expect
to
accept
this
reconciliation
of
stanley
and
roth.
i've
my
own
private
view.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
and
may
i
say
so
with
respect
on
the
fourth
amendment.
there
is
a
great
deal
of
talk
about
the
first
amendment
in
stanley.
the
dissenting
opinions
or
concurring
opinions
rested
it
on
the
fourth
amendment.
i
find
it
quite
easy
to
handle
the
two
cases
on
that
basis.
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
find
consistency
between
roth
and
the
statement
in
stanley
opinion.
roth
and
the
cases
following
that
decision
are
not
impaired
by
today’s
holding.
now,
they
are
certainly
are
impaired
as
to
the
privacy
of
the
man’s
home
and
if
that
sentence
had
said
except
with
respect
to
the
privacy
of
a
man’s
home,
roth
and
the
cases
following
that
decision
are
not
impaired
by
today’s
holding,
i
could
follow
it
better.
the
statement
however,
made
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
was
quite
unqualified.
and
then
we
have
year-and-a-half
ago,
united
stated
against
reidel
where
five
members
of
the
court
concurred
in
a
majority
opinion.
mr.
justice
harlan
filed
a
concurring
opinion
and
three
members
of
the
court
dissented.
but
in
reidel,
the
majority
and
may
i
say
with
respect
including
mr.
stewart
joined
in
the
statement.
roth
has
not
been
overruled.
it
remains
the
law
in
this
court
and
governs
this
case.
and
if
the
law
is
that
obscenity
and
the
materials
in
this
case
are
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
obscene
is
not
protected
by
the
first
amendment
that
would
seem
to
dispose
of
the
case
and
it
went
on
to
say,
but
it
neither
overruled
nor
disturbed
the
holding
in
roth.
and
then
quoted
the
language
from
roth
which
i
have
given
and
reversed
the
district
court
in
that
case
by
saying
that
the
district
court
gave
stanley
too
wide
a
sweep.
and
finally,
the
court
said
on
page
356,
“but
roth
has
squarely
placed
obscenity
and
this
is
a
majority
of
the
court,
roth
has
squarely
placed
obscenity
in
its
distribution
outside
the
reach
of
the
first
amendment
and
they
remained
there
today.
stanley
did
not
overrule
roth
and
we
decline
to
do
so
now.”
and
then
at
the
very
close
of
the
opinion
it
says
that
these
matters
remain
within
state
power,
roth
and
like
cases
posed
no
obstacle
to
such
developments.
now,
mr.
justice
harlan
concurred
and
justices
marshall,
black
and
douglas
dissented.
immediately
following
that
decision,
there
was
decided
united
states
against
thirty-seven
photographs,
where
as
you
will
recall
there
were
two
questions,
one
might
be
called
the
time
question,
the
question
of
the
speed
with
which
the
government
can
operate
in
this
and
there
was
a
clear
majority
on
that
issue
and
we
are
endeavoring
to
carry
out
that
determination
of
the
court,
but
then
the
court
went
on
and
--
to
decide
to
further
questions.
one
with
respect
to
the
fact
that
the
district
court
in
thirty-seven
photographs
had
ruled
in
favor
of
the
defendant
even
though
the
importation
there
was
for
commercial
purposes.
on
the
ground
that
the
statute
was
over
broad
because
it
was
also
applicable
to
a
private
importation.
and
if
the
statute
was
over
broad
then
it
was
unconstitutional
and
then
it
fell
as
to
commercial
importation
too.
and
a
total
of
six
members
of
the
court
joined
in
saying
that
that
application
of
the
statute
was
wrong.
that
the
statute
was
valid
as
applied
to
commercial
importation.
but
only
four
members
of
the
court
joined
in
a
plurality
opinion
with
respect
to
whether
a
private
importation
was
covered
by
the
statute.
that
opinion
by
mr.
justice
white
is
again
in
strong
terms,
reiterates
roth.
holds
roth
fully
applicable
and
then
we
come
to
mr.
justice
stewart’s
opinion
which
made
up
one
of
the
six,
along
with
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
justice
stewart
turning
to
the
private
aspect
of
the
importation
says,
“but
i
would
not
decide,
would
not
in
this
case
decide
even
by
way
of
dicta
that
the
government
may
lawfully
seize
literary
material
intended
for
the
purely
private
use
of
the
importer.”
and
then
he
goes
to
give
his
own
private
dictum
as
i
read
it,
perhaps
wrong,
“that
it
would
be
invalid
as
applied
to
a
private
importer.”
he
concludes,
“if
the
government
can
constitutionally
take
the
book
away
from
him
as
he
passes
through
customs”
then
i
do
not
understand
the
meaning
of
stanley
v.
georgia
and
i
can
only
say
mr.
justice
that
i
don't
understand
the
meaning
of
stanley
v.
georgia
particularly
in
the
light
of
its
treatment
in
the
subsequent
cases.
and
so
we
come
to
the
question
on
which
a
majority
of
the
court
has
not
yet
spoken
whether
an
importation
for
private
purposes
is
in
some
way
which
i
find
hard
to
follow
brought
within
the
language
of
the
first
amendment
or
is
within
the
decision
of
the
court
in
stanley
against
georgia
as
that
case
has
been
explained
in
the
case
itself
and
in
the
two
subsequent
cases
of
reidel
and
thirty-seven
photographs.
now,
surely
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution
about
a
distinction
between
private
and
commercial
with
respect
to
the
application
of
the
first
amendment.
surely
the
first
amendment
applies
to
commercial
publication.
after
all
our
newspapers
have
always
been
commercial.
our
television
networks
are
one
of
the
greatest
commercial
activities
in
the
country
where
very
large
sums
are
made
by
use
of
public
facilities
resulting
among
other
things
in
very
high
cost
for
election
campaigns.
i
don’t
disparage
the
slightest
the
business
of
the
newspapers
or
of
the
television.
i
simply
point
out
that
a
distinction
between
public
and
private
with
respect
to
the
first
amendment
is
between
commercial
and
private
with
respect
to
the
first
amendment
is
one
which
finds
no
application
or
support
in
any
other
area
and
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
see
why
it
should
hear.
moreover,
if
as
the
court
has
not
only
decided,
but
has
reiterated
in
recent
time,
obscenity
is
not
within
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment.
i
cannot
see
how
it
makes
any
difference
whether
it
is
commercial
or
private.
at
least,
as
long
as
it
not
in
the
privacy
of
the
home
which
is
the
area
which
was
involved
in
stanley.
and
any
application
of
stanley
broader
than
that
is
certainly
not
a
decision
in
that
case,
but
is
a
dictum
of
some
sort
which
has
not
met
full
support
from
the
court
in
subsequent
decisions.
now,
there
are
references
in
other
cases
to
penumbras
of
the
first
amendment.
i
recognize
that
the
first
amendment
ought
not
to
be
construed
in
strictly
literal
terms.
i
have
even
contended
here
that
no
law
does
not
mean
no
law
and
that
still
seems
to
me
to
be
in
some
applications
a
sound
argument.
similarly,
the
first
amendment
need
not
be
construed
literally
in
its
broader
application.
but
a
penumbra
i
am
told
is
an
area
of
partial
darkness
between
the
light
and
total
darkness.
it
is
also
a
realm
of
great
uncertainty
where
the
conclusions,
i
would
suggest
with
great
respect,
are
not
found
in
the
constitution,
but
are
found
in
the
minds
of
the
person
who
is
writing
about
the
particular
problem.
i
find
it
extremely
difficult
to
see
how
it
is
appropriate
to
extend,
i
won’t
say
the
constitution,
but
to
extend
the
application
of
the
constitution
to
a
matter
which
for
a
century
and
three
quarters
has
been
regarded
as
within
the
complete
control
of
congress
the
--
under
its
power
to
regulate
foreign
commerce
the
importation
of
items
into
the
united
states.
the
mere
fact
that
it
is
private
does
not
seem
to
me
to
justify
the
conclusion
that
congress
cannot
regulate
the
importation.
that
would
be
equally
true
of
narcotics
or
explosives
or
other
material
which
a
person
might
want
to
bring
in
on
his
person,
a
diamond
ring
or
something
else
that
he
had
acquired
abroad.
he
is
subject
not
only
to
having
to
declare
those
and
pay
duty
on
them,
but
in
certain
cases
to
be
searched
and
to
have
the
property
seized.
the
mere
fact
that
it
is
private
does
not
seem
to
me
to
support
it.
the
fact
that
it
is
in
print
doesn’t
seem
to
me
to
help
any
at
least
if
there
is
any
vitality
to
the
repeatedly
re-declared
statement
in
roth
that
obscenity
is
not
within
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment.
that
decision
in
roth
seems
to
me
to
be
sound
at
the
time.
the
court
has
taken
occasion
in
a
number
of
decisions
to
reiterate
its
support
for
that
decision
in
roth
and
that
seems
to
me
to
be
sufficient
to
disclose
of
this
case.
accordingly,
we
urge
that
the
judgment
below
be
reversed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i
cannot
answer
that.
i
think
that
though
this
statute
was
enacted
in
1938
it
had
predecessors
and
that
full
legislative
history
would
be
long
and
complicated
and
i
cannot
give
it
to
you.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
would
like
to
make
only
two
points
in
rebuttal.
the
argument
that
there
is
a
right
to
receive
and
that
this
supports
the
distribution
of
material
was
in
essence
the
heard
argument
in
the
reidel
case
and
was
the
argument
which
was
rejected
by
a
majority
of
the
court
there.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
was
undertaking
simply
to
support
senator
kuchel’s
concession
on
that
to
refer
specifically
to
the
reidel
case
which
decided
that
i
believe
and
also
to
the
decision
of
the
court
per
curium
in
gable
against
jenkins
397
us
592
decided
shortly
after
the
stanley
case
in
which
the
power
of
the
state
of
georgia
to
regulate
the
dissemination
of
such
material
was
expressly
confirmed.
the
other
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
i
think
that
for
practical
purposes
the
distinction
between
private
and
commercial
in
this
area
is
illusory.
it
is
appealing
in
a
sense,
of
course,
in
the
sense
that
led
to
stanley
and
georgia,
the
freedom
of
a
man’s
mind
to
think
what
he
wants
to
think.
but
there
is
no
practical
way
to
deal
with
a
decision
which
says
that
if
the
matter
is
private
it
can
be
imported,
but
if
it
is
commercial
it
can’t
be
imported.
the
only
thing
that
you
could
go
by
would
be
the
man’s
own
statement
plus
perhaps
the
quantities
of
materials
imported
and
here
there
was
a
very
substantial
quantity.
it
is
one
thing
to
say
it
is
in
his
luggage,
it
is
in
his
pocket,
it
is
in
his
home
but
how
are
you
going
to
keep
them
there?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
is
stipulated
that
he
claims
that
they
are
for
private
purposes
and
that
the
government
has
no
evidence
to
the
contrary.
how
would
the
government
ever
have
any
evidence
to
the
contrary
at
point
in
importation?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
can
accept
and
recognize
that
there
would
be
certain
cases
when
it
would
be
possible
to
do
that.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
then
what?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
would
not
be
at
least
any
crime
under
any
existing
law
if
he
then
sold
it.
moreover
by
the
time
he
has
sold
it,
it
is
in
the
extreme
of
commerce
and
the
purpose
of
congress
in
trying
to
keep
such
materials
out
has
been
entirely
frustrated.
i
simply
repeat
that
it
is
not
practical.
a
decision
that
things
can
be
imported
by
a
person,
does
it
have
to
be
in
his
luggage
accompanying
him
or
can
he
ship
it
in
as
he
comes
in
or
can
he
ship
it
in
while
he
is
abroad
in
order
to
have
it
home
when
he
gets
there?
how
would
any
one,
how
would
custom's
officers,
officers
of
the
government
endeavoring
honestly
to
comply
with
the
decisions
of
the
court
deal
with
it
is
a
practical
matter.
i
submit
that
to
decide
that
it
can
be
imported
for
private
purposes
is
in
effect
to
overrule
the
consequences
of
thirty-seven
photographs
which
the
court
decided
last
term.
