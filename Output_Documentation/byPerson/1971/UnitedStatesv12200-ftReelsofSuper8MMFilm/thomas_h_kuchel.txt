mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
appearing
as
a
friend
of
the
court,
we
would
urge
that
the
statute
in
this
case
is
unconstitutional
because
of
overbreadth,
because
it
would
seek
to
deprive
one
paladini,
the
citizen
whose
luggage
was
inspected
on
his
way
back
to
this
country,
of
the
right
to
receive
information
and
ideas
and
to
his
private
possession
of
that
information.
in
stanley
versus
georgia,
the
court
recognized
two
fundamental
liberties
encompassed
within
the
first
amendment.
it
recognized
the
right
to
receive
information
and
ideas,
regardless
of
their
social
worth.
it
recognized
the
right
of
privacy,
from
unwanted
government
intrusion
to
films
or
books
for
personal
use.
mr.
chief
justice
whether
or
not
materials
possessed
for
private
use
are
obscene,
is
completely
irrelevant
to
the
recognition
of
the
fundamental
liberties
described
in
stanley
versus
georgia.
and
i
quote
two
sentences
from
reidel,
“the
personal
constitutional
rights
of
those
like
stanley,”
said
this
court,
“to
possess
and
read
obscenity
in
their
homes
and
their
freedom
of
mind
and
thought,
do
not
depend
on
whether
the
materials
are
obscene
or
whether
obscenity
is
constitutionally
protected.
their
rights
to
have
and
to
view
that
material
in
private,
are
independently
saved
by
the
constitution.”
the
right
to
have
--
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
there
is
that
language
in
thirty-seven
photos.
i
would
most
respectfully
urge
that
--
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
no
sir,
it
does
not.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
sir.
mr.
justice,
i
do
want
most
respectfully
to
come
in
on
that
particular
language
in
the
--
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
yes
sir,
but
i
would
not
argue
from
that
point
of
view.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
you
are,
yes
mr.
justice.
the
right
to
have
and
to
view
materials
in
privacy
can
be
meaningful
at
all
only
if
all
places
of
privacy
are
given
equal
dignity.
materials
can
be
possessed
privately
outside
the
home,
such
as
in
one's
office,
something
which
the
appellant’s
brief
incidentally
recognizes,
in
one’s
luggage,
in
one’s
clothing.
if
stanley
had
a
right
to
possess
for
private
use,
obscenity
in
his
home,
surely
it
would
be
a
rather
narrow
constitutional
right,
if
as
he
stepped
off
the
steps
leading
to
his
home
with
whatever
he
had
in
his
pocket,
that
at
that
point
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment
would
evaporate.
it
would
be
illogical
and
destructive
of
privacy
to
permit
intrusion
into
the
freedom
of
mind,
and
thought
in
private
places
other
than
the
home.
and
it
could
lead
to
an
absurd
result,
that
a
man
could
be
prosecuted
for
private
possession
of
materials
when
he
left
his
home,
possessing
books
on
his
person,
on
his
way
to
his
office,
or
to
take
up
another
residence,
or
to
retire
to
the
privacy
of
a
mountain
cabin.
the
law
recognizes
that
privacy
is
not
restricted
to
one's
home.
this
court
has
said
that
the
law
protects
people,
and
not
places.
stanley
versus
georgia,
clearly
doesn't
derive
its
vitality,
from
the
fact
that
stanley's
home
was
involved.
the
home
is
not
a
search
proof
heaven
for
possession
of
illegal
materials
to
the
contrary
in
stanley
itself,
a
valid
search
warrant
to
both
local
officers
and
federal
officers
in
the
stanley's
home.
but
this
court
vindicated
stanley's
right
to
keep
certain
articles
and
there
can
be
no
difference
between
the
kind
of
inspection
under
the
fourth
amendment
in
stanley
than
the
customs
inspection
which
took
place
with
respect
to
the
luggage
of
paladini
as
he
returned
to
this
country.
if
stanley
had
a
right
of
privacy,
if
he
had
a
right
regardless
of
the
type
of
materials
which
he
had,
to
possess
in
his
home,
should
he
not
have
a
right
to
bring
similar
materials
into
this
country
and
is
it
not
irrelevant
that
a
customs
inspection
took
place
as
he
arrived
back
in
this
country.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
mr.
justice,
i
would
urge
no.
i
would
urge
that
congress
has
under
the
constitution
a
broad
power
with
respect
to
post
offices
and
post
roads.
i
would
urge
that
congress
has
a
broad
power
with
respect
to
regulation
of
commerce,
but
this
court
in
determining
the
power
of
congress
in
those
fields
must
take
into
consideration,
the
liberties
guaranteed
in
the
bill
of
rights,
and
particularly
with
respect
to
this
case,
the
first
amendment,
that
is
what
makes
a
book
or
a
film,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
most
respectfully
say
different
from
narcotics
or
steel
the
government
of
the
united
states
can
obtain
the
right
to
search
a
home
in
order
to
determine
whether
narcotics
are
possessed
by
the
individual
who
lives
there
and
seize
them.
the
difference
which
makes
the
film
or
the
print
or
the
book,
a
greatly
distinct
problem
is
because
of
the
first
amendment
guarantees.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
my
response
would
be
that
this
court,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
in
stanley,
particularly
determined
that
stanley
was
entitled
to
posses
obscenity
in
his
home
for
private
use
that
is
the
decision
of
this
court.
it
was
a
first
amendment
decision.
i
respectfully
disagree
with
the
solicitor
general.
it
was
on
the
basis
of
the
first
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
this
court's
opinion
was
written.
my
argument
would
be
that
if
there
is
a
right,
under
stanley,
or
a
person
to
have
a
right
of
privacy
in
his
home
to
obscenity,
that
right
does
not
rest
upon
the
fact
that
it
is
in
his
home,
but
that
it
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
no
mr.
justice,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
customs
inspector
was
performing
a
function
which
was
closed
by
law.
he
had
a
responsibility
to
make
that
search
in
a
reasonable
fashion,
but
the
fact
that
he
made
that
search
should
not
interfere
with
paladini’s
rights
to
possess
for
private
purposes,
the
films
that
are
involved
in
this
case.
what
is
the
difference
between
stanley's
right?
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
yes
sir,
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
precisely.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
it
is
precisely,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
because
if
i
read
stanley
correct,
it
was
because
the
first
amendment
rights
that
prevented
the
seizure
of
the
items
in
the
stanley.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
i
do
not
understand.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
mr.
justice,
i
thought
that
stanley
determined
that
there
was
a
right
to
receive
and
a
right
to
posses
so
long
as
those
rights
were
exercised
in
private,
so
long
as
there
was
no
vindication
of
a
public
distribution.
whether,
it
be
commercial
or
not,
i
think,
so
long
as
those
rights
were
exercised
by
the
individual
himself
in
private
that
he
was
protected
and
i
read
that
as
an
interpretation
of
rights
accruing
to
the
citizen
under
the
first
amendment.
i
think
it
is
also
fair
to
say
that
stanley
put
to
rest
any
notion
that
the
difficulties
in
prosecution
of
commercial
distribution
is
a
reason
for
denying
first
amendment
freedom
of
individuals
to
receive
information
and
to
be
free
from
government
intrusion.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
i
would
argue
that
reidel
represented
a
case
involving
public
distribution,
commercial
distribution
--
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
do
we
assume
that
the
book
is
obscene
under
the
courts
definition?
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
then
it
is
a
sale.
then
it
is
a
public
distribution
and
that
is
something
entirely
different.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
i
would,
but
that
is
not
a
question.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
not
at
all,
not
at
all.
i
think
that
your
and
my
rights
of
privacy,
under
the
first
amendment,
have
got
to
be
considered
in
every
question
that
comes.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
you
would
never
have
a
purchaser
before
this
court
in
a
lawsuit.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
you
have?
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
it's
just
what
i
believe
that
roth
and
reidel,
may
stand
alongside
of
stanley
and
alongside
of
the
judgment
in
the
district
court
in
this
case
and
i
most
respectfully
say
to
you
that
with
respect
to
reidel,
i
do
not
quarrel
with
the
decision
in
that
case,
but
i
do
quarrel
with
the
language
which
then
went
on
in
that
case
and
indicated
that
even
for
private
use,
a
person
would
be
guilty.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
excuse
me,
excuse
me.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
yes,
i
would
not
urge
any
rights
of
the
seller
of
obscenity
in
this
country
and
there
is
the
question
of
where
the
material
which
paladini
in
the
case
at
bar
acquired
is
unanswered.
presumably
he
purchased
it
abroad
and
flew
back
into
this
country
with
it
in
his
luggage,
but
i
do
not
believe
it
is
necessary
in
order
to
vindicate
first
amendment
rights
of
privacy
to
protect
the
seller
of
obscenity.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
i
do
not
believe
so.
i
believe
that
--
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
would
you
repeat
that
mr.
justice?
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
simply
because
you
were
applying
a
rule
of
reason
to
the
rights
of
free
speech
and
i
think
when
you
curtail
certain
out
bursts,
you
did
it
because
--
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
yes.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
yes.
i
misunderstood.
the
solicitor
general
asked
how
could
a
customs
collector
counter
that
traveler’s
claim.
i
would
say
that
that
is
not
the
basis
question
on
which
this
court
should
deny
paladini
his
first
amendment
rights
of
privacy.
there
are
statutory
procedures
under
which
a
federal
employee,
working
in
customs
may
ask
questions,
may
make
a
determination
on
his
own
as
to
what
the
intent
may
be,
by
which
a
person
brings
items
of
personal
property
back
into
this
country.
and
i
--
stanley
itself
went
on
to
say,
we
are
faced
with
the
argument
that
prohibition
of
possession
of
obscene
materials
is
a
necessary
incident
to
statutory
schemes
prohibiting
distribution.
that
argument
is
based
on
a
alleged
difficulties
that
proving
an
intent
to
distribute
or
in
producing
evidence
of
actual
distribution.
we
are
not
convinced
that
such
difficulties
exist,
but
even
if
they
did,
we
do
not
think
that
they
would
justify
infringement
of
the
individual's
right
to
read
or
observe
what
he
pleases
because
that
right
is
so
fundamental
to
our
scheme
of
individual
liberty.
it's
restriction
may
not
be
justified,
by
the
need
to
ease
the
administration
of
otherwise
valid
federal
laws
to
somewhat
--
there
is
no
question
raised
here
about
obscenity.
this
is
a
question
of
the
private
possession
of
obscenity
for
private
use.
we
would
urge
this
court
to
recognize
that
a
citizen
under
this
constitution
ought
to
have
a
right
in
private
to
read
and
to
possess
what
he
pleases.
and
we
would
urge
that,
that
right
would
be
unnecessarily
and
unreasonably
constrict
if
it
were
made
to
apply
only
to
his
home.
that
right
against
governmental
thought
control
ought
to
follow
him
when
he
leaves
his
home,
with
whatever
kind
of
tract,
political
or
other,
goes
to
his
office,
and
it
ought
also
to
accompany
him
when
he
returns
from
a
trip
overseas.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
i
would
indeed.
i
think
he
falsified
his
position
when
he
returned
to
this
country
and
he
should
not
be
covered.
there
is
a
statute
i
believe
in
the
state
of
new
york
which
finds
that
if
there
are
more
than
half-a-dozen
copies
of
something
that
an
individual
has,
that
is
evidence
of
the
intention,
of
he
who
possess
it
to
sell.
there
are
many
ways
that
you
might
credibly
judge
the
intent,
with
which
a
person
returns
to
this
country
with
a
book
that
he
may
have
purchased
abroad.
but
surely
the
difficulties
involved
in
the
enforcement
of
the
law
ought
not
to
be
used
as
a
basis
to
punish
the
rights
to
the
first
amendment.
just
one
more
sentence,
and
i'm
through;
there
could
be
chilling
effect,
mr.
chief
justice
if
the
court
please,
on
an
american
citizen
going
to
abroad.
if
he
wanted
to
buy
a
book
to
read
and
yet
wondered,
whether
he
would
be
subjected
to
scorn
when
he
returned
to
this
country
because
it
might
be
a
borderline
case
that
some
one
in
the
government
would
determine
was
obscene
and
therefore
it
would
have
a
chilling
effect
on
the
traveling
american.
all
in
all,
we
would
most
respectfully
urge,
that
judgment
of
the
district
court
be
affirmed.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
thank
you,
sir.
i
am
honored
by
your
words.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
the
solicitor
general
has
indicated
one
paladini,
an
american
returned
home
from
abroad
with
certain
motion
picture
films
and
printed
materials
which
were
seized
by
custom’s
officials
after
a
search.
a
complaint
for
forfeiture
was
filed.
the
district
court
found
us
code
1305
(a)
unconstitutional.
in
a
motion
for
a
stay
in
the
district
court,
the
united
states
advised
the
court
and
i
quote,
“does
not
contest
the
fact
that
this
was
private
importation.”
also
as
the
solicitor
general
has
indicated,
the
obscenity
of
the
seized
articles
is
assumed
for
the
purposes
of
this
argument.
it
is
our
position
that
19
u.s.c.
1305
(a),
cannot
be
constitutionally
applied
to
the
facts
in
this
case
which
we
believe
fall
within
the
scope
of
stanley
v.
georgia.
in
reidel,
mr.
justice
white
said
for
this
court,
“the
personal
constitutional
rights
of
those
like
stanley
to
possess
and
read
obscenity
in
their
homes,
and
their
freedom
of
mind
and
thought
do
not
depend
on
whether
the
materials
are
obscene
or
whether
obscenity
is
constitutionally
protected.
their
rights
to
have
and
to
view
that
material
in
private
are
independently
saved
by
the
constitution.
if
a
man,
as
reidel
indicated,
has
a
constitutional
freedom
of
mind
and
of
thought,
if
he
has
a
constitutional
right
to
possess
and
to
read
in
private
any
material,
however
shabby
or
outrageous
or
offensive,
it
might
be
to
the
rest
of
us,
then
the
content
of
that
material
is
completely
irrelevant
to
his
exercise
of
those
rights.
and
well
it
should
be
for
any
theory
by
which
our
government
would
exercise
any
control
over
a
man’s
mind
or
his
thoughts
over
what
in
his
own
privacy
he
chooses
to
read
or
to
view
is
surely
repugnant
to
our
concept
of
constitutional
freedom
of
the
individual
under
this
system.”
stanley
holds
and
i
quote
it,
“the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
prohibit
making
mere
private
possession
of
obscene
material
a
crime.”
roth
and
the
cases
following
that
decision,
said
the
court
in
stanley,
are
not
impaired
by
today’s
holding.
as
we
have
said,
the
states
retain
broad
power
to
regulate
obscenity.
that
power
simply
does
not
extend
to
mere
possession
by
the
individual
in
the
privacy
of
his
own
home.
we
think,
said
the
court
in
stanley,
“that
mere
categorization
of
these
films
as
obscene
is
insufficient
justification
for
such
a
drastic
invasion
of
personal
liberties
guaranteed
by
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments”
and
so
one
more
quote
from
that
decision,
“whatever
the
power
of
the
state
to
control
public
dissemination.”
that
is
the
word
public
not
commercial;
public
dissemination
of
ideas
inimical
to
public
morality.
it
cannot
constitutionally
premise
legislation
on
the
desirability
of
the
controlling
a
person’s
private
thoughts
and
that
sound
doctrine
it
seems
to
me
ought
to
prevent
the
state
from
interfering
with
the
private
thoughts
of
a
person
wherever
he
may
be.
the
right
to
be
let
alone,
the
right
to
be
free
from
unwanted
governmental
intrusions
into
ones
privacy
except
in
very
limited
circumstances,
are
rights
which
this
court
has
said
protects
the
individual
in
whatever
he
intends
to
preserve
as
private
away
from
the
scrutiny
of
the
public.
in
capps
versus
united
states,
the
court
said
the
fourth
amendment
protects
people
not
places.
what
a
person
knowingly
exposes
to
the
public
even
in
his
own
home
or
office
is
not
a
subject
to
fourth
amendment
protection.
but
what
he
seeks
to
preserve
is
private,
even
in
an
area
accessible
to
the
public
may
be
constitutionally
protected.
and
in
hoffa
versus
the
united
states,
the
court
said
“what
the
fourth
amendment
protects
is
a
security
a
man
relies
upon
when
he
places
himself
or
his
property
within
a
constitutionally
protected
area
be
it
at
his
home
or
his
office,
his
hotel
room
or
is
automobile.”
there,
said
the
court,
“he
is
protected
from
unwarranted
government
intrusion”
and
when
he
puts
something
in
his
filing
cabinet
and
in
his
desk
door
or
in
his
pocket,
he
has
the
right
to
know
what
would
be
secure
from
an
unreasonable
search
or
an
unreasonable
seizure.
the
home
just
as
any
other
place
maybe
searched
on
the
basis
of
a
warrant
issued
on
probable
cause,
defining
with
particularity
the
subject
matter
of
the
search.
the
locus
of
the
articles
in
stanley’s
home
clearly
is
not
what
protected
stanley.
what
protected
stanley
was
that
the
articles
were
motion
picture
films
and
printed
material,
articles
with
first
amendment
implications.
any
other
contraband
which
might
have
been
found
in
stanley’s
home
in
the
course
of
a
lawful
search
would
not
have
been
so
protected.
for
example,
during
the
search
of
stanley’s
home
if
officers
discovered
in
plain
sight
an
illegal
machine
gun
or
an
unregistered
whiskey
still,
they
would
have
been
authorized
to
seize
and
to
prosecute
stanley
for
illegal
possession
of
it.
it
is
therefore
clear
i
submit
that
the
result
in
stanley
is
deeply
rooted
in
the
first
amendment.
the
right
to
private
possession
is
in
no
sense
inconsistent
with
the
government’s
right
of
custom’s
inspection.
in
the
sense,
customs
officials
are
clothed
with
a
blanket
statutory
search
warrant
authority
to
determine
what
articles
are
being
imported,
whether
they
may
be
lawfully
imported,
and
whether
and
to
what
extent
they
might
be
dutiable.
and
in
accordance
with
thirty-seven
since
obscene
materials
intended
for
commercial
use
maybe
excluded,
inquiry
can
be
made
as
to
the
intention
of
an
importer
of
allegedly
obscene
materials
and
i
want
to
observe
that
thirty-seven
was
not
the
case
of
private
importation.
the
fact
that
customs
officers
may
not
seize
material
intended
for
private
use,
should
have
no
adverse
effect
at
all
on
law
enforcement
responsibilities
of
the
customs
people.
in
its
brief,
the
united
states
argues
and
i
quote
from
page
10
of
that
brief,
“that
to
subject
homeowners
to
searches
for
possession
of
obscene
materials
would
induce
self
censorship
reaching
to
protected
speech
and
would
generate
a
chilling
effect
upon
the
exercise
of
the
first
amendment
right
to
peruse
materials
that
are
not
obscene.”
that
apparently
is
sound
argument
and
we
submit
that
it
applies
with
equal
impact
on
the
american
traveler,
who
is
returning
from
abroad.
he
has
of
course,
the
unquestioned
right
to
import
non-obscene
material,
but
would
there
not
be
an
equally
chilling
effect
upon
him
as
he
ponders
the
purchase,
for
example
of
a
book
which
he
believes
to
be
non
obscene,
but
still
is
consumed
with
a
fear
that
some
customs
people
may
disagree
with
him.
that
same
chilling
effect
could
easily
deter
an
american
down
the
street
in
this
country
from
ordering
even
a
possible
press
from
a
foreign
source.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
what
i
am
trying
to
do
is
to
speak
for
the
facts
in
this
case
and
so
far
as
a
commercial
importer
is
concerned
i
rather
doubt
that
the
fear
would
run
against
the
non-obscenity
possibility,
but
it
would
be
the
other
way
around.
he
want
to
import
those
that
clearly
be
obscene,
if
he
is
interested
in
commercial
distribution.
the
solicitor
general
in
his
argument
referred
to
hand
grenades
and
narcotics
privately
sought
to
be
brought
into
this
country
except
for
the
law.
i
know
of
no
basis
on
which
you
can
equate
hand
grenades
or
narcotics
with
rights
guaranteed
to
the
american
people
under
the
first
amendment
and
i
would
say
that
that
is
not
an
argument
against
the
findings
of
the
district
court.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
what
kind
of
a
constitutional
right
is
the
right
to
read
or
to
view
undisturbed
by
the
state
if
it
may
only
be
asserted
behind
the
closed
doors
of
ones
home?
should
not
that
right
accompany
a
person
wherever
he
goes,
to
his
office
or
on
returning
from
a
trip
abroad
as
well
as
in
his
home?
and
why
should
his
constitutional
rights
under
the
first
amendment
or
the
fourth
amendment
or
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
any
part
of
the
bill
of
rights,
be
abridged
or
shriveled
by
equating
him
with
a
public
distributor
of
obscenity.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
mr.
chief
justice,
this
court
in
stanley
recognized
a
right
to
receive
information.
you
did
not
comment
on
whether
the
reception
should
be
free
of
charge
or
for
money,
but
if
it
is
the
intent
as
i
would
urge
it
is,
which
makes
a
difference
with
respect
to
the
intent
for
private
use
or
for
public
use
then
i
would
take
the
position
that
an
individual
american
citizen
desiring
to
obtain
any
printed
information
for
private
use
would
have
the
right
to
obtain
it
in
a
lawful
manner.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
i
cannot
stand
before
this
court
and
say
no.
i
would
say
that
there
is
a
right
on
the
part
of
the
state
to
prohibit
the
dissemination
of
material
which
it
would
find
was
obscene.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
i
regret
and
i
find
myself
in
a
position
where
i
am
seeking
to
apply
the
rights
to
receive
as
stanley
has
laid
down.
but
i
offer
no
argument
against
a
law
in
which
a
seller
would
be
guilty
of
a
breach
of
statute.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
i
am
acquainted
with
the
griswold
versus
--
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
the
case
now
pending
squarely
presents
this
question,
may
the
united
states
constitutionally
seize
motion
picture
films
and
printed
material
intended
for
the
private
use
of
the
importer?
the
answer
is
in
the
negative
and
the
question
really
answers
itself.
if
intended
for
private
use
then
the
character
or
subject
matter
of
the
films
and
printed
material
can
be
of
no
concern
to
the
government.
fundamentally,
therefore
and
i
repeat
it
is
the
intent,
which
we
submit
should
be
controlling.
it
may
well
be
that
the
whole
bundle
of
a
person’s
private
constitutional
right
to
possess
such
literary
material
as
he
desires,
to
think
as
he
wishes
and
to
view
or
read
what
he
pleases,
must
give
way
to
the
authority
of
a
state
to
prohibit
or
control
at
the
moment
when
he
does
not
seek
to
exercise
those
private
rights,
but
to
the
contrary
intends
to
sell
or
otherwise
distribute
to
the
public
any
of
the
material
he
has
in
his
possession.
but
so
long
as
what
material
he
has,
he
intends
to
keep
to
himself
in
a
personal
or
private
way,
he
should
be
protected
against
the
state
either
because
of
stanley
or
because
of
what
stanley
foreshadows
not
alone
in
his
home,
but
any
where
else
where
he
keeps
such
material
in
private.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
appearing
as
a
friend
of
the
court,
we
would
urge
that
the
statute
in
this
case
is
unconstitutional
because
of
overbreadth,
because
it
would
seek
to
deprive
one
paladini,
the
citizen
whose
luggage
was
inspected
on
his
way
back
to
this
country,
of
the
right
to
receive
information
and
ideas
and
to
his
private
possession
of
that
information.
in
stanley
versus
georgia,
the
court
recognized
two
fundamental
liberties
encompassed
within
the
first
amendment.
it
recognized
the
right
to
receive
information
and
ideas,
regardless
of
their
social
worth.
it
recognized
the
right
of
privacy,
from
unwanted
government
intrusion
to
films
or
books
for
personal
use.
mr.
chief
justice
whether
or
not
materials
possessed
for
private
use
are
obscene,
is
completely
irrelevant
to
the
recognition
of
the
fundamental
liberties
described
in
stanley
versus
georgia.
and
i
quote
two
sentences
from
reidel,
“the
personal
constitutional
rights
of
those
like
stanley,”
said
this
court,
“to
possess
and
read
obscenity
in
their
homes
and
their
freedom
of
mind
and
thought,
do
not
depend
on
whether
the
materials
are
obscene
or
whether
obscenity
is
constitutionally
protected.
their
rights
to
have
and
to
view
that
material
in
private,
are
independently
saved
by
the
constitution.”
the
right
to
have
--
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
there
is
that
language
in
thirty-seven
photos.
i
would
most
respectfully
urge
that
--
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
no
sir,
it
does
not.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
sir.
mr.
justice,
i
do
want
most
respectfully
to
come
in
on
that
particular
language
in
the
--
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
yes
sir,
but
i
would
not
argue
from
that
point
of
view.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
you
are,
yes
mr.
justice.
the
right
to
have
and
to
view
materials
in
privacy
can
be
meaningful
at
all
only
if
all
places
of
privacy
are
given
equal
dignity.
materials
can
be
possessed
privately
outside
the
home,
such
as
in
one's
office,
something
which
the
appellant’s
brief
incidentally
recognizes,
in
one’s
luggage,
in
one’s
clothing.
if
stanley
had
a
right
to
possess
for
private
use,
obscenity
in
his
home,
surely
it
would
be
a
rather
narrow
constitutional
right,
if
as
he
stepped
off
the
steps
leading
to
his
home
with
whatever
he
had
in
his
pocket,
that
at
that
point
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment
would
evaporate.
it
would
be
illogical
and
destructive
of
privacy
to
permit
intrusion
into
the
freedom
of
mind,
and
thought
in
private
places
other
than
the
home.
and
it
could
lead
to
an
absurd
result,
that
a
man
could
be
prosecuted
for
private
possession
of
materials
when
he
left
his
home,
possessing
books
on
his
person,
on
his
way
to
his
office,
or
to
take
up
another
residence,
or
to
retire
to
the
privacy
of
a
mountain
cabin.
the
law
recognizes
that
privacy
is
not
restricted
to
one's
home.
this
court
has
said
that
the
law
protects
people,
and
not
places.
stanley
versus
georgia,
clearly
doesn't
derive
its
vitality,
from
the
fact
that
stanley's
home
was
involved.
the
home
is
not
a
search
proof
heaven
for
possession
of
illegal
materials
to
the
contrary
in
stanley
itself,
a
valid
search
warrant
to
both
local
officers
and
federal
officers
in
the
stanley's
home.
but
this
court
vindicated
stanley's
right
to
keep
certain
articles
and
there
can
be
no
difference
between
the
kind
of
inspection
under
the
fourth
amendment
in
stanley
than
the
customs
inspection
which
took
place
with
respect
to
the
luggage
of
paladini
as
he
returned
to
this
country.
if
stanley
had
a
right
of
privacy,
if
he
had
a
right
regardless
of
the
type
of
materials
which
he
had,
to
possess
in
his
home,
should
he
not
have
a
right
to
bring
similar
materials
into
this
country
and
is
it
not
irrelevant
that
a
customs
inspection
took
place
as
he
arrived
back
in
this
country.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
mr.
justice,
i
would
urge
no.
i
would
urge
that
congress
has
under
the
constitution
a
broad
power
with
respect
to
post
offices
and
post
roads.
i
would
urge
that
congress
has
a
broad
power
with
respect
to
regulation
of
commerce,
but
this
court
in
determining
the
power
of
congress
in
those
fields
must
take
into
consideration,
the
liberties
guaranteed
in
the
bill
of
rights,
and
particularly
with
respect
to
this
case,
the
first
amendment,
that
is
what
makes
a
book
or
a
film,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
most
respectfully
say
different
from
narcotics
or
steel
the
government
of
the
united
states
can
obtain
the
right
to
search
a
home
in
order
to
determine
whether
narcotics
are
possessed
by
the
individual
who
lives
there
and
seize
them.
the
difference
which
makes
the
film
or
the
print
or
the
book,
a
greatly
distinct
problem
is
because
of
the
first
amendment
guarantees.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
my
response
would
be
that
this
court,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
in
stanley,
particularly
determined
that
stanley
was
entitled
to
posses
obscenity
in
his
home
for
private
use
that
is
the
decision
of
this
court.
it
was
a
first
amendment
decision.
i
respectfully
disagree
with
the
solicitor
general.
it
was
on
the
basis
of
the
first
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
this
court's
opinion
was
written.
my
argument
would
be
that
if
there
is
a
right,
under
stanley,
or
a
person
to
have
a
right
of
privacy
in
his
home
to
obscenity,
that
right
does
not
rest
upon
the
fact
that
it
is
in
his
home,
but
that
it
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
no
mr.
justice,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
customs
inspector
was
performing
a
function
which
was
closed
by
law.
he
had
a
responsibility
to
make
that
search
in
a
reasonable
fashion,
but
the
fact
that
he
made
that
search
should
not
interfere
with
paladini’s
rights
to
possess
for
private
purposes,
the
films
that
are
involved
in
this
case.
what
is
the
difference
between
stanley's
right?
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
yes
sir,
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
precisely.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
it
is
precisely,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
because
if
i
read
stanley
correct,
it
was
because
the
first
amendment
rights
that
prevented
the
seizure
of
the
items
in
the
stanley.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
i
do
not
understand.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
mr.
justice,
i
thought
that
stanley
determined
that
there
was
a
right
to
receive
and
a
right
to
posses
so
long
as
those
rights
were
exercised
in
private,
so
long
as
there
was
no
vindication
of
a
public
distribution.
whether,
it
be
commercial
or
not,
i
think,
so
long
as
those
rights
were
exercised
by
the
individual
himself
in
private
that
he
was
protected
and
i
read
that
as
an
interpretation
of
rights
accruing
to
the
citizen
under
the
first
amendment.
i
think
it
is
also
fair
to
say
that
stanley
put
to
rest
any
notion
that
the
difficulties
in
prosecution
of
commercial
distribution
is
a
reason
for
denying
first
amendment
freedom
of
individuals
to
receive
information
and
to
be
free
from
government
intrusion.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
i
would
argue
that
reidel
represented
a
case
involving
public
distribution,
commercial
distribution
--
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
do
we
assume
that
the
book
is
obscene
under
the
courts
definition?
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
then
it
is
a
sale.
then
it
is
a
public
distribution
and
that
is
something
entirely
different.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
i
would,
but
that
is
not
a
question.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
not
at
all,
not
at
all.
i
think
that
your
and
my
rights
of
privacy,
under
the
first
amendment,
have
got
to
be
considered
in
every
question
that
comes.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
you
would
never
have
a
purchaser
before
this
court
in
a
lawsuit.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
you
have?
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
it's
just
what
i
believe
that
roth
and
reidel,
may
stand
alongside
of
stanley
and
alongside
of
the
judgment
in
the
district
court
in
this
case
and
i
most
respectfully
say
to
you
that
with
respect
to
reidel,
i
do
not
quarrel
with
the
decision
in
that
case,
but
i
do
quarrel
with
the
language
which
then
went
on
in
that
case
and
indicated
that
even
for
private
use,
a
person
would
be
guilty.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
excuse
me,
excuse
me.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
yes,
i
would
not
urge
any
rights
of
the
seller
of
obscenity
in
this
country
and
there
is
the
question
of
where
the
material
which
paladini
in
the
case
at
bar
acquired
is
unanswered.
presumably
he
purchased
it
abroad
and
flew
back
into
this
country
with
it
in
his
luggage,
but
i
do
not
believe
it
is
necessary
in
order
to
vindicate
first
amendment
rights
of
privacy
to
protect
the
seller
of
obscenity.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
i
do
not
believe
so.
i
believe
that
--
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
would
you
repeat
that
mr.
justice?
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
simply
because
you
were
applying
a
rule
of
reason
to
the
rights
of
free
speech
and
i
think
when
you
curtail
certain
out
bursts,
you
did
it
because
--
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
yes.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
yes.
i
misunderstood.
the
solicitor
general
asked
how
could
a
customs
collector
counter
that
traveler’s
claim.
i
would
say
that
that
is
not
the
basis
question
on
which
this
court
should
deny
paladini
his
first
amendment
rights
of
privacy.
there
are
statutory
procedures
under
which
a
federal
employee,
working
in
customs
may
ask
questions,
may
make
a
determination
on
his
own
as
to
what
the
intent
may
be,
by
which
a
person
brings
items
of
personal
property
back
into
this
country.
and
i
--
stanley
itself
went
on
to
say,
we
are
faced
with
the
argument
that
prohibition
of
possession
of
obscene
materials
is
a
necessary
incident
to
statutory
schemes
prohibiting
distribution.
that
argument
is
based
on
a
alleged
difficulties
that
proving
an
intent
to
distribute
or
in
producing
evidence
of
actual
distribution.
we
are
not
convinced
that
such
difficulties
exist,
but
even
if
they
did,
we
do
not
think
that
they
would
justify
infringement
of
the
individual's
right
to
read
or
observe
what
he
pleases
because
that
right
is
so
fundamental
to
our
scheme
of
individual
liberty.
it's
restriction
may
not
be
justified,
by
the
need
to
ease
the
administration
of
otherwise
valid
federal
laws
to
somewhat
--
there
is
no
question
raised
here
about
obscenity.
this
is
a
question
of
the
private
possession
of
obscenity
for
private
use.
we
would
urge
this
court
to
recognize
that
a
citizen
under
this
constitution
ought
to
have
a
right
in
private
to
read
and
to
possess
what
he
pleases.
and
we
would
urge
that,
that
right
would
be
unnecessarily
and
unreasonably
constrict
if
it
were
made
to
apply
only
to
his
home.
that
right
against
governmental
thought
control
ought
to
follow
him
when
he
leaves
his
home,
with
whatever
kind
of
tract,
political
or
other,
goes
to
his
office,
and
it
ought
also
to
accompany
him
when
he
returns
from
a
trip
overseas.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
i
would
indeed.
i
think
he
falsified
his
position
when
he
returned
to
this
country
and
he
should
not
be
covered.
there
is
a
statute
i
believe
in
the
state
of
new
york
which
finds
that
if
there
are
more
than
half-a-dozen
copies
of
something
that
an
individual
has,
that
is
evidence
of
the
intention,
of
he
who
possess
it
to
sell.
there
are
many
ways
that
you
might
credibly
judge
the
intent,
with
which
a
person
returns
to
this
country
with
a
book
that
he
may
have
purchased
abroad.
but
surely
the
difficulties
involved
in
the
enforcement
of
the
law
ought
not
to
be
used
as
a
basis
to
punish
the
rights
to
the
first
amendment.
just
one
more
sentence,
and
i'm
through;
there
could
be
chilling
effect,
mr.
chief
justice
if
the
court
please,
on
an
american
citizen
going
to
abroad.
if
he
wanted
to
buy
a
book
to
read
and
yet
wondered,
whether
he
would
be
subjected
to
scorn
when
he
returned
to
this
country
because
it
might
be
a
borderline
case
that
some
one
in
the
government
would
determine
was
obscene
and
therefore
it
would
have
a
chilling
effect
on
the
traveling
american.
all
in
all,
we
would
most
respectfully
urge,
that
judgment
of
the
district
court
be
affirmed.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
thank
you,
sir.
i
am
honored
by
your
words.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
the
solicitor
general
has
indicated
one
paladini,
an
american
returned
home
from
abroad
with
certain
motion
picture
films
and
printed
materials
which
were
seized
by
custom’s
officials
after
a
search.
a
complaint
for
forfeiture
was
filed.
the
district
court
found
us
code
1305
(a)
unconstitutional.
in
a
motion
for
a
stay
in
the
district
court,
the
united
states
advised
the
court
and
i
quote,
“does
not
contest
the
fact
that
this
was
private
importation.”
also
as
the
solicitor
general
has
indicated,
the
obscenity
of
the
seized
articles
is
assumed
for
the
purposes
of
this
argument.
it
is
our
position
that
19
u.s.c.
1305
(a),
cannot
be
constitutionally
applied
to
the
facts
in
this
case
which
we
believe
fall
within
the
scope
of
stanley
v.
georgia.
in
reidel,
mr.
justice
white
said
for
this
court,
“the
personal
constitutional
rights
of
those
like
stanley
to
possess
and
read
obscenity
in
their
homes,
and
their
freedom
of
mind
and
thought
do
not
depend
on
whether
the
materials
are
obscene
or
whether
obscenity
is
constitutionally
protected.
their
rights
to
have
and
to
view
that
material
in
private
are
independently
saved
by
the
constitution.
if
a
man,
as
reidel
indicated,
has
a
constitutional
freedom
of
mind
and
of
thought,
if
he
has
a
constitutional
right
to
possess
and
to
read
in
private
any
material,
however
shabby
or
outrageous
or
offensive,
it
might
be
to
the
rest
of
us,
then
the
content
of
that
material
is
completely
irrelevant
to
his
exercise
of
those
rights.
and
well
it
should
be
for
any
theory
by
which
our
government
would
exercise
any
control
over
a
man’s
mind
or
his
thoughts
over
what
in
his
own
privacy
he
chooses
to
read
or
to
view
is
surely
repugnant
to
our
concept
of
constitutional
freedom
of
the
individual
under
this
system.”
stanley
holds
and
i
quote
it,
“the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
prohibit
making
mere
private
possession
of
obscene
material
a
crime.”
roth
and
the
cases
following
that
decision,
said
the
court
in
stanley,
are
not
impaired
by
today’s
holding.
as
we
have
said,
the
states
retain
broad
power
to
regulate
obscenity.
that
power
simply
does
not
extend
to
mere
possession
by
the
individual
in
the
privacy
of
his
own
home.
we
think,
said
the
court
in
stanley,
“that
mere
categorization
of
these
films
as
obscene
is
insufficient
justification
for
such
a
drastic
invasion
of
personal
liberties
guaranteed
by
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments”
and
so
one
more
quote
from
that
decision,
“whatever
the
power
of
the
state
to
control
public
dissemination.”
that
is
the
word
public
not
commercial;
public
dissemination
of
ideas
inimical
to
public
morality.
it
cannot
constitutionally
premise
legislation
on
the
desirability
of
the
controlling
a
person’s
private
thoughts
and
that
sound
doctrine
it
seems
to
me
ought
to
prevent
the
state
from
interfering
with
the
private
thoughts
of
a
person
wherever
he
may
be.
the
right
to
be
let
alone,
the
right
to
be
free
from
unwanted
governmental
intrusions
into
ones
privacy
except
in
very
limited
circumstances,
are
rights
which
this
court
has
said
protects
the
individual
in
whatever
he
intends
to
preserve
as
private
away
from
the
scrutiny
of
the
public.
in
capps
versus
united
states,
the
court
said
the
fourth
amendment
protects
people
not
places.
what
a
person
knowingly
exposes
to
the
public
even
in
his
own
home
or
office
is
not
a
subject
to
fourth
amendment
protection.
but
what
he
seeks
to
preserve
is
private,
even
in
an
area
accessible
to
the
public
may
be
constitutionally
protected.
and
in
hoffa
versus
the
united
states,
the
court
said
“what
the
fourth
amendment
protects
is
a
security
a
man
relies
upon
when
he
places
himself
or
his
property
within
a
constitutionally
protected
area
be
it
at
his
home
or
his
office,
his
hotel
room
or
is
automobile.”
there,
said
the
court,
“he
is
protected
from
unwarranted
government
intrusion”
and
when
he
puts
something
in
his
filing
cabinet
and
in
his
desk
door
or
in
his
pocket,
he
has
the
right
to
know
what
would
be
secure
from
an
unreasonable
search
or
an
unreasonable
seizure.
the
home
just
as
any
other
place
maybe
searched
on
the
basis
of
a
warrant
issued
on
probable
cause,
defining
with
particularity
the
subject
matter
of
the
search.
the
locus
of
the
articles
in
stanley’s
home
clearly
is
not
what
protected
stanley.
what
protected
stanley
was
that
the
articles
were
motion
picture
films
and
printed
material,
articles
with
first
amendment
implications.
any
other
contraband
which
might
have
been
found
in
stanley’s
home
in
the
course
of
a
lawful
search
would
not
have
been
so
protected.
for
example,
during
the
search
of
stanley’s
home
if
officers
discovered
in
plain
sight
an
illegal
machine
gun
or
an
unregistered
whiskey
still,
they
would
have
been
authorized
to
seize
and
to
prosecute
stanley
for
illegal
possession
of
it.
it
is
therefore
clear
i
submit
that
the
result
in
stanley
is
deeply
rooted
in
the
first
amendment.
the
right
to
private
possession
is
in
no
sense
inconsistent
with
the
government’s
right
of
custom’s
inspection.
in
the
sense,
customs
officials
are
clothed
with
a
blanket
statutory
search
warrant
authority
to
determine
what
articles
are
being
imported,
whether
they
may
be
lawfully
imported,
and
whether
and
to
what
extent
they
might
be
dutiable.
and
in
accordance
with
thirty-seven
since
obscene
materials
intended
for
commercial
use
maybe
excluded,
inquiry
can
be
made
as
to
the
intention
of
an
importer
of
allegedly
obscene
materials
and
i
want
to
observe
that
thirty-seven
was
not
the
case
of
private
importation.
the
fact
that
customs
officers
may
not
seize
material
intended
for
private
use,
should
have
no
adverse
effect
at
all
on
law
enforcement
responsibilities
of
the
customs
people.
in
its
brief,
the
united
states
argues
and
i
quote
from
page
10
of
that
brief,
“that
to
subject
homeowners
to
searches
for
possession
of
obscene
materials
would
induce
self
censorship
reaching
to
protected
speech
and
would
generate
a
chilling
effect
upon
the
exercise
of
the
first
amendment
right
to
peruse
materials
that
are
not
obscene.”
that
apparently
is
sound
argument
and
we
submit
that
it
applies
with
equal
impact
on
the
american
traveler,
who
is
returning
from
abroad.
he
has
of
course,
the
unquestioned
right
to
import
non-obscene
material,
but
would
there
not
be
an
equally
chilling
effect
upon
him
as
he
ponders
the
purchase,
for
example
of
a
book
which
he
believes
to
be
non
obscene,
but
still
is
consumed
with
a
fear
that
some
customs
people
may
disagree
with
him.
that
same
chilling
effect
could
easily
deter
an
american
down
the
street
in
this
country
from
ordering
even
a
possible
press
from
a
foreign
source.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
what
i
am
trying
to
do
is
to
speak
for
the
facts
in
this
case
and
so
far
as
a
commercial
importer
is
concerned
i
rather
doubt
that
the
fear
would
run
against
the
non-obscenity
possibility,
but
it
would
be
the
other
way
around.
he
want
to
import
those
that
clearly
be
obscene,
if
he
is
interested
in
commercial
distribution.
the
solicitor
general
in
his
argument
referred
to
hand
grenades
and
narcotics
privately
sought
to
be
brought
into
this
country
except
for
the
law.
i
know
of
no
basis
on
which
you
can
equate
hand
grenades
or
narcotics
with
rights
guaranteed
to
the
american
people
under
the
first
amendment
and
i
would
say
that
that
is
not
an
argument
against
the
findings
of
the
district
court.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
what
kind
of
a
constitutional
right
is
the
right
to
read
or
to
view
undisturbed
by
the
state
if
it
may
only
be
asserted
behind
the
closed
doors
of
ones
home?
should
not
that
right
accompany
a
person
wherever
he
goes,
to
his
office
or
on
returning
from
a
trip
abroad
as
well
as
in
his
home?
and
why
should
his
constitutional
rights
under
the
first
amendment
or
the
fourth
amendment
or
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
any
part
of
the
bill
of
rights,
be
abridged
or
shriveled
by
equating
him
with
a
public
distributor
of
obscenity.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
mr.
chief
justice,
this
court
in
stanley
recognized
a
right
to
receive
information.
you
did
not
comment
on
whether
the
reception
should
be
free
of
charge
or
for
money,
but
if
it
is
the
intent
as
i
would
urge
it
is,
which
makes
a
difference
with
respect
to
the
intent
for
private
use
or
for
public
use
then
i
would
take
the
position
that
an
individual
american
citizen
desiring
to
obtain
any
printed
information
for
private
use
would
have
the
right
to
obtain
it
in
a
lawful
manner.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
i
cannot
stand
before
this
court
and
say
no.
i
would
say
that
there
is
a
right
on
the
part
of
the
state
to
prohibit
the
dissemination
of
material
which
it
would
find
was
obscene.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
i
regret
and
i
find
myself
in
a
position
where
i
am
seeking
to
apply
the
rights
to
receive
as
stanley
has
laid
down.
but
i
offer
no
argument
against
a
law
in
which
a
seller
would
be
guilty
of
a
breach
of
statute.
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
i
am
acquainted
with
the
griswold
versus
--
mr.
thomas
h.
kuchel
the
case
now
pending
squarely
presents
this
question,
may
the
united
states
constitutionally
seize
motion
picture
films
and
printed
material
intended
for
the
private
use
of
the
importer?
the
answer
is
in
the
negative
and
the
question
really
answers
itself.
if
intended
for
private
use
then
the
character
or
subject
matter
of
the
films
and
printed
material
can
be
of
no
concern
to
the
government.
fundamentally,
therefore
and
i
repeat
it
is
the
intent,
which
we
submit
should
be
controlling.
it
may
well
be
that
the
whole
bundle
of
a
person’s
private
constitutional
right
to
possess
such
literary
material
as
he
desires,
to
think
as
he
wishes
and
to
view
or
read
what
he
pleases,
must
give
way
to
the
authority
of
a
state
to
prohibit
or
control
at
the
moment
when
he
does
not
seek
to
exercise
those
private
rights,
but
to
the
contrary
intends
to
sell
or
otherwise
distribute
to
the
public
any
of
the
material
he
has
in
his
possession.
but
so
long
as
what
material
he
has,
he
intends
to
keep
to
himself
in
a
personal
or
private
way,
he
should
be
protected
against
the
state
either
because
of
stanley
or
because
of
what
stanley
foreshadows
not
alone
in
his
home,
but
any
where
else
where
he
keeps
such
material
in
private.
