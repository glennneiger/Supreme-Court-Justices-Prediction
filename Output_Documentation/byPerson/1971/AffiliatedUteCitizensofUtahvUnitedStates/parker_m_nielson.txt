mr.
parker
m.
nielson
mr.
justice
douglas
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
matter
now
at
bar
involves
the
seemingly
unrelated
provisions
of
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934
and
the
ute
termination
act
of
1954.
these
two
seemingly
unrelated
statutes
are
drawn
into
focus
in
this
case
because
both
of
them
involved
prohibitions
against
overreaching
and
both
of
them
create
limited
fiduciary
obligations
with
respect
to
those
who
are
subject
to
their
provisions.
the
ute
termination
act
of
1954
had
the
effect
of
dividing
the
ute
indian
tribe
of
the
uintah
and
ouray
reservations
into
two
entirely
artificially
created
groups
and
directing
that
all
of
the
assets
of
the
reservations,
including
in
particular,
as
far
as
the
fact
of
this
case
are
concerned,
beneficial
interest
in
the
mineral
estate,
were
to
be
divided
between
the
two
groups
and
to
be
distributed
to
the
--
the
indians
about
to
be
terminated.
now,
i
note
in
passing
that
those
who
are
responsible
for
the
drafting
of
this
law
have
referred
to
the
group
that
was
about
to
be
terminated
as
mixed-bloods.
the
term
“mixed-blood”
is
itself
a
slur,
and
it
is
offensive
to
the
petitioners
in
this
case
who
prefer
to
be
referred
to
by
the
term
“terminated
utes”.
the
petitioner
affiliated
ute
citizens
of
the
state
of
utah
is
the
authorized
representative
of
all
the
terminated
utes,
which
was
formed
in
the
manner
specified
in
section
6
of
the
ute
termination
act
by
a
constitution
and
bylaws
which
was
duly
ratified
by
the
majority
vote
of
all
of
the
adult
terminated
utes
at
a
special
election
called
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
when
i
made
reference
to
that
circumstance,
what
i
had
in
mind
is
that
in
reality,
if
we
want
to
talk
in
terms
of
the
ancestry
of
the
indians
on
this
reservation,
all
of
them
are
indeed
mixed-bloods.
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
yes.
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
it
does,
mr.
justice
stewart,
and
my
point
simply
was
that
the
term
itself
is
offensive
to
the
petitioners
and
they
have
designated
themselves
otherwise
in
these
proceedings.
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
the
statute
that
so
provide.
no
one
in
these
proceedings
disputes
that
the
affiliated
ute
citizens
was
the
organization
which
was
formed
in
the
manner
specified
by
the
statute.
there
is,
however,
a
rival
organization,
which
we
will
discuss
in
some
detail
in
these
proceedings,
known
as
the
ute
distribution
corporation.
the
ute
distribution
corporation
is
a
corporation
formed
under
the
corporate
laws
of
the
state
of
utah.
it
was
not
formed
by
the
adoption
of
a
constitution
and
bylaws,
it
was
not
ratified
by
a
majority
vote
of
all
terminated
ute
indians
nor
was
it
considered
at
a
special
election
called
by
the
secretary
for
that
purpose.
that's
the
crux
of
the
problem
in
this
case.
these
are
the
--
these
two
rival
organizations
is
the
question
of
how
the
powers
of
the
authorized
representative
could
have
been
transferred
from
the
affiliated
ute
citizens,
who
admittedly
were
originally
invested
with
those
powers,
to
the
ute
distribution
corporation.
it
is,
thus,
a
conveyancing
problem,
plain
and
simple.
and
i
invite
the
court
to
pay
particular
attention
to
the
manner
in
which
it
is
proposed
that
those
powers
were
shifted
one
--
from
one
organization
to
the
other.
the
question
turns
on
the
definition
of
authorized
representatives
as
contained
in
the
act.
we're
not
concerned
for
the
purpose
of
that
definition
with
the
question
of
ownership
of
property.
section
10
of
the
ute
termination
act
which
is
the
section
which
defines
the
--
the
authorized
representative
powers
refers
exclusively
to
the
question
of
powers
to
manage
the
jointly
held
and
--
and
restricted
assets
of
the
two
groups
of
indians
in
the
mineral
estate.
it
does
not
speak
in
terms
of
ownership
of
property.
the
united
states
has
proposed
that
the
powers
were
transferred
from
auc
to
udc
by
virtue
of
the
provisions
of
section
13
of
the
termination
act.
section
13
by
contrast
speaks
only
and
speaks
exclusively
of
powers
with
respect
to
the
ownership
of
property.
the
joint
--
the
--
the
authorized
representative
powers
were
not
powers
that
had
any
relationship
to
the
ownership
of
property
and
in
particular,
to
the
ownership
of
property
by
the
individual
mixed-blood
or
terminated
ute
indian,
which
is
all
that
section
13
relates
to.
the
individual
petitioners
in
these
proceedings
are
members
of
the
affiliated
ute
citizens
who
have
brought
a
fraud
claim
based
upon
their
sale
of
stock
in
the
ute
distribution
corporation.
now,
for
the
purpose
of
their
fraud
claim,
and
this
distinction
must
be
kept
in
mind,
the
question
of
the
regularity
of
the
formation
of
the
ute
distribution
corporation
is
not
an
issue.
it
is
not
an
issue
because
the
proceeds
from
the
management
of
this
joint
mineral
estate
over
the
period
of
time
that
we're
here
concerned
with
has
been
paid
in
the
form
of
dividends
through
the
ute
distribution
corporation.
the
recognition
at
this
point
that
the
affiliated
ute
citizens
as
the
proper
authorized
representative
will
not
have
the
effect
of
restoring
to
the
terminated
utes
the
dividends
or
the
royalties
which
they
have
lost
by
reason
of
--
of
those
practices.
thus,
the
regularity
of
ute
distribution
corporation
is
an
issue
with
respect
to
the
affiliated
utes
part
of
the
claim,
it
is
not
an
issue
with
respect
to
the
individual
indians
fraud
claims
in
the
real
side
of
this
case.
the
defendants
in
the
fraud
claims
are
the
first
security
bank
of
utah
and
two
of
its
officers.
the
united
states
was
not
a
defendant
in
the
fraud
claims.
the
conduct
of
the
bank
and
its
officers
arises
by
reason
of
its
conduct
in
executing
its
duties
under
a
business
agent
agreement
which
contemplated
that
they
were
to
act
as
stock
transfer
agent
to
hit
the
books
and
reference
of
the
corporation
and
perform
certain
incidental
services.
it
is
the
common
element
of
the
conduct
of
the
bank
pursuant
to
that
practice
which
are
important
as
far
as
the
fraud
claims
are
concerned.
these
common
elements
affected
every
indian
sale.
it
doesn't
really
matter
who
the
sale
was
--
was
negotiated
with.
the
common
elements
affected
necessarily
affected
every
sale.
by
common
elements
i
refer
to
the
fact
that
every
indian
stock
certificate,
which
had
bold,
red
letter
legend,
warning
him
of
--
of
its
value
and
of
restrictions
on
its
transfer
were
locked
up
in
the
bank
walls
and
the
bank
refused
to
make
those
certificates
available
to
any
indian
prior
to
august
27,
1964
even
when
he
requested
them
and
made
no
alternate
effort
to
convey
the
purport
of
those
warnings
to
the
--
to
the
indian
who
desire
to
sell
his
stock.
that
practice
affected
every
indian.
the
bank
and
its
officers
were
also
acting
in
a
capacity
which
we
could
loosely
refer
to
as
a
market
making
function,
that
is
they
were
encouraging
purchasers
of
the
stock,
many
of
whom
are
located
throughout
the
united
states.
they
were
encouraging
the
--
the
sale
of
stock.
and
in
many
cases,
they
were
doing
these
things
through
the
medium
of
agents
on
both
sides.
that
practice
affected
every
indian
sale
notwithstanding
who
he
may
have
sold
to.
in
every
indian's
sale,
there
was
also
a
deviation
from
the
regulatory
provision
which
had
been
promulgated
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
specifically,
the
regulations
require
that
any
sale
must
be
by
endorsement
of
the
certificate
itself,
never
in
the
history
of
the
ute
termination
act,
at
least
prior
to
august
27,
1964,
was
a
sale
negotiated
in
that
fashion.
the
regulations
also
required
that
the
superintendent
of
the
reservation
supervise
the
price
and
the
terms
of
the
sale
according
to
the
terms
of
the
offer
which
require
payments
by
cashier's
check,
certified
check
or
postal
money
order,
never
was
a
sale
supervised
in
that
fashion.
those
practices
affected
every
indian's
transaction.
also,
the
bank
and
its
officers
neglected
and
failed
to
disclose
to
any
of
these
indians
that
they
were
acting
on
its
dual
capacity
as
market
maker
in
relation
to
the
stock.
now,
it
is
true
that
there
are
also
a
large
number
of
other
facts
which
affected
any
particular
indian
stock
and
the
petitioner
certainly
take
the
position
that
those
dissimilar
facts
standing
alone
would
be
sufficient
to
give
rise
to
a
fraud
claim.
and
the
bank,
in
its
briefs
in
this
case,
has
attempted
to
focus
on
those
dissimilar
facts.
the
petitioners
take
the
position
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
get
involve
in
the
dispute
over
whether
any
particular
indian
got
a
car,
whether
economic
pressures
were
applied
to
any
particular
indian
in
its
sole
and
what
fashion
the
economic
pressures
were
applied
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
common
elements,
which
necessarily
affected
every
transaction,
are
sufficient
to
give
rise
to
the
fraud
claims
and
were
so
determined
by
the
trial
judge.
the
claim
against
the
united
states
with
respect
to
the
sales
of
the
ute
distribution
corporation
stock
has
brought
them
on
negligence.
it
is
the
claim
of
the
petitioners
that
the
united
states
negligently
permitted
a
deviation
from
the
regulations
which
have
been
promulgated,
permitted
a
deviation
from
their
requirement
that
the
endorsement
of
the
stock
certificate
be
the
only
way
in
which
this
--
the
stock
could
be
transferred
substituted
in
its
step
the
--
the
transfer
of
the
stock
by
means
of
a
separate
stock
power.
that
may
seem
unimportant
on
the
surface
that
the
effect
of
that
deviation
from
the
regulations
was
to
withhold
from
the
indians
the
warnings
which
were
--
which
were
printed
on
that
stock
for
his
benefit.
the
united
states
also,
even
though
as
we
read
the
statute
in
regulations,
congress
plainly
directed
that
the
superintendent
was
to
regulate
the
price
in
terms
of
sale.
instead
of
doing
so,
the
superintendent
adopted
a
practice
of
--
of
receiving
a
certificate
from
the
indian
himself,
the
selling
indian
who
was
legally
in
--
in
the
position
of
a
war,
that
he
had
in
fact
received
his
--
his
money.
thus,
there
was
a
complete
application
of
the
responsibilities
of
the
united
states
in
that
regard
and
the
person
who
was
legally
in
the
position
of
the
award
was
the
one
who
the
united
states
looked
to
--
to
satisfy
those
--
those
regulatory
obligations
whereas
congress,
i
think
a
fair
reading
of
the
act
would
--
would
bear
me
out
on
this
plainly
contemplated
that
bia
should
--
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
that
is
true,
mr.
justice
marshall.
that
was
the
dominant
purpose
of
the
statute,
but
it's
also
true
that
congress
recognized
in
adopting
the
statute
as
it
did
in
all
of
the
termination
acts
that
these
people
were
going
to
have
some
trouble.
they
were
not
accustomed
to
managing
property
because
they
had
been
under
the
protective
wing
of
the
united
states
for
so
many
years,
and
so
congress
wisely,
i
think,
directed
that
there'd
be
a
face
period
three
in
which
services
and
protections
would
be
withdrawn
from
that,
and
that
that
period
was
to
extend
for
a
full
10
years.
now,
experience
was
proven
that
even
that
wasn't
enough,
that
--
that
these
people
needed
protections
even
beyond
what
congress
contemplated,
but
the
thing
we
are
here
complaining
about
is
--
is
that
the
protections
which
congress
directed
were
not
secured
to
these
people
and
that
by
reason
of
that,
they
were
deprived
of
their
property.
now,
in
many
ways,
the
complaint
of
these
petitioners
seems
based
upon
fine
distinctions
in
the
law.
we
presented
enough
a
lot
of
complex
legal
arguments
in
the
briefs.
in
reality,
however,
we're
talking
about
a
very
fundamental
proposition,
a
very
practical
and
fundamental
proposition.
we
could
analogize,
i
think,
to
a
situation
where
it
say,
a
person
were
to
buy
an
annuity
and
pay
for
it
throughout
his
life,
and
when
that
annuity
were
to
mature,
instead
of
the
insurance
company
paying
the
proceeds
of
the
annuity
to
the
annuity
simply
took
the
proceeds
and
invest
with
it
for
his
benefit
will
stay
in
a
mutual
fund.
now,
it
is
not
a
question
of
whether
that
investment
is
a
good
one
or
a
bad
one.
it's
not
a
question
in
this
case
as
to
whether
the
ute
distribution
corporation
is
a
good
idea
or
bad
idea.
it's
not
a
question
of
whether
ute
distribution
corporation
was
--
was
well
managed
or
whether
it
was
mismanaged.
the
problem
really
is
the
indignity
of
the
act
itself
to
take
a
group
of
people
such
as
these
terminated
utes
and
say
to
them
by
way
of
congressional
enactment
that
we're
going
to
remove
restrictions
on
--
on
your
person
and
on
your
property,
and
you're
going
to
be
treated
like
any
other
citizens
in
this
country
and
yet
before
that
property
ever
gets
into
that
indian's
hands
to
take
it
and
assign
it,
to
have
bia
assign
it
to
this
corporation,
and
not
only
to
assignment
but
to
make
the
assignment
or
purport
to
make
the
assignment
irrevocable
so
that
it
would
bind
himself
and
his
heirs
forever.
now,
congress
plainly
declared
in
the
statute
that
they
were
to
receive
their
property
in
such
a
fashion
that
it
could
be
inherited
and
decreed.
that
is
the
language
of
the
statute.
but
bia
attempted
to
completely
frustrate
that
--
the
congressional
intent
by
making
this
assignment
to
the
ute
distribution
corporation.
now,
turning
to
the
rule
10b-5
aspects
of
the
case,
this
case
represent
for
the
first
time
in
which
this
court
has
had
occasion
to
speak
with
reference
to
the
fundamental
ingredients
of
a
cause
of
action
under
rule
10b-5.
i
submit
that
the
case
is
a
very
good
one.
it's
a
very
good
vehicle
for
this
court
to
consider
the
elements
of
a
tried
action
under
rule
10b-5
because
of
the
wide
variety
of
misconduct
which
is
alleged
in
this
case,
which
accord
this
court
an
opportunity
to
consider
the
whole
array
of
possible
conduct
which
could
be
considered
as
a
violation
of
rule
10b-5.
it's
also
a
good
vehicle
because
the
petitioners
themselves
have
a
peculiar
need
for
the
sort
of
protection
which
were
afforded
under
rule
10b-5.
and
this
court,
many
times
in
the
past,
in
the
capital
gains
case
and
--
and
other
cases
which
it
has
considered
on
--
on
related
issues
have
said
that
the
need
for
investor
protection
is
a
relevant
consideration
which
should
be
taken
into
account
in
determining
whether
any
particular
factual
situation
falls
within
the
proscription
of
rule
10b-5.
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
not
for
the
rule
10b-5
claim,
not
for
the
fraud
claim.
the
federal
court
of
that
is
with
exclusive
jurisdiction
under
the
exchange
act
of
a
cause
of
action
under
rule
10b-5.
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
there
is
no
other
claim
(inaudible)
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
i
don't
think
that
--
well
--
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
i
suppose
it
would
have
been
possible
for
them
between
(inaudible)
on
the
fraud
claim.
i
think
that
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
bring
in
indian
law
claims
in
the
state
court
even
with
respect
to
the
state
(inaudible)
however
the
--
the
very
reason
that
most
of
these
security
fraud
cases
wind
up
in
the
federal
court
is
because
the
remedy
under
the
state
(inaudible)
is
inadequate.
it's
inadequate
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
states
are
played
with
short
statutes
of
limitations,
which
frequently
bar
fraud
claimant.
secondly,
the
state
procedure
affords
the
opportunity
for
devices
such
as
nonresident
cash
funds
and
things
of
this
sort
which
are
--
which
are
employed
by
defense
attorneys
(inaudible)
to
bring
in
a
legitimate
claim.
and
so,
in
general,
as
a
practical
matter,
we
suggest
that
as
--
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
no,
i
don't
suggest
that.
now,
as
i
read
rule
10b-5,
it
basically
requires
inhibition
to
the
jurisdictional
elements,
the
showing
of
two
elements.
and
they
are
as
follows.
first
of
all,
there
must
be
one
or
two
prohibited
acts,
that
is
there
must
be
in
their
brief
a
(inaudible)
or
there
must
be
a
misstatement
of
a
material
fact
or
omission
of
statement
of
material
facts
or
a
course
of
business
which
is
preclude
might
be
build
in
a
fraud.
secondly,
that
conduct,
whatever
it
might
be,
must
be
accomplished
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
a
security.
now,
i
stress
the
words
“in
connection
with”
because,
as
professor
bromberg
has
said
in
his
credos
on
the
subject
of
rule
10b-5,
the
words
“in
connection
with”
are
elusive
and
we
assume
intentionally
elusive
(inaudible)
which
is
prescribed
in
any
of
the
federal
security
laws.
section
17
(a)
of
the
1933
securities
act,
for
example,
uses
the
term
the
fraudulent
practice
which
is
substantially
the
same
must
be
in
the
offer
or
sale
of
a
security.
it
must
be
in
the
offer
or
sale.
this
act
says
“in
connection
with
the
offer
or
sale
of
a
security”.
the
lower
federal
court
in
--
during
the
period
of
time
that
implied
liability
have
been
developing
under
the
exchange
act,
section
10
and
rule
10b-5
have
wrestled
with
the
question
of
whether
additional
elements
may
be
engrafted
on
to
those
prescribed
by
the
rule.
they
have
considered
a
wide
assortment
of
additional
element
including
scienter,
proximate
cause,
reliance,
i've
incurred
the
principle,
one
could
say
it's
considered.
the
error
of
the
court
below
in
this
case
was
that
it
went
far
beyond
even
what
has
been
required
in
--
in
other
courts
which
have
considered
the
elements
and
required
in
this
case
that
there
be
a
direct
participation
as
a
purchaser
or
a
seller
and
that
that
direct
participation
must
be
for
a
promise.
thus,
the
lower
court
in
this
case
imposed
upon
these
plaintiffs
a
standard
which
is
far
higher
than
even
that
which
is
described
in
section
17
(a)
of
the
1933
securities
act,
and
i
might
add,
even
higher
than
was
required
at
common
law.
we
submit
that
the
limiting
factors
which
are
prescribed
in
the
statute
and
rule
itself
are
entirely
adequate
and
are
the
only
ones
which
ought
to
be
considered.
i
refer
in
particular
to
the
requirement
of
a
suing
of
materiality.
the
respondent
bank
itself
is
no
different
that
even
the
court,
which
talk
in
terms
of
reliance,
quite
often
sum
up
defining
reliance
so
that
it
comes
out
sounding
just
about
like
materiality.
the
other
limiting
factor
which
was
prescribed
by
the
statute
and
rule
is
that
of
causation.
i
note
that
the
rule
itself
does
not
meet
the
term
"causation"
but
i
have
cited
some
legislative
history
in
my
brief
which
would
indicate
that
congress
in
considering
the
1934
act
did
make
reference
to
the
fact
that
any
person
who
is
injured
by
these
practices
or
whose
injury
was
caused
by
these
practices
ought
to
be
able
to
recover
and
therefore
i
submit
with
causation
in
the
(inaudible)
sense
would
be
an
appropriate
limiting
factor.
i
think
that
that
instruction
has
borne
out
by
the
language
of
the
act,
and
i
know
them
particularly
within
this
act,
congress
attempted
to
proscribe
any
misconduct
(inaudible)
which
is
defined
by
the
rule
in
connection
with
any
purchase
or
sale
of
security.
i
think
the
use
of
the
term
"any"
in
both
of
those
contexts
were
the
calculated
one
and
that
it
should
be
given
effect.
as
i
say
the
common
law
in
cases
most
analogous
to
the
fact
now
it
bar
does
not
impose
a
requirement
nearly
as
high
as
that
required
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
i
cited
in
my
brief
the
common
law
deceit
cases
which
were
--
which
arose
in
the
contract
of
market
sales
of
securities.
and
what
those
cases
stand
for?
and
also
some
writings
of
professor
thompson
denoted
expert
on
corporation.
what
those
cases
stand
for
is
the
proposition
that
if
a
person
makes
a
misstatement
were
played
by
--
by
means
of
a
prospective
and
he
distributes
--
distributes
it
to
the
public
at
large
in
one
case
that
was
cited
by
means
of
leaving
it
at
a
bank
so
that
any
member
of
the
public
could
pick
it
up
and
read
it.
if
there
are
lies
in
that
prospective,
any
member
in
particular
should
be
permitted
to
recover
because
it
was
directed
to
any
member
of
the
public
thus,
they
come
within
the
ambit
of
responsibility
by
contracts
of
the
misrepresentation
was
made
to
a
limited
group
why
then
also
the
ambit
of
responsibility
which
refer
to
be
restricted.
that
was
the
rule
at
the
common
law
and
it
is
universally
recognized
that
rule
10b-5
is
an
expansion
of
--
of
the
common
law
and
therefore,
i
submit
that
we
should
at
least
read
this
rule
as
broadly
as
the
provision
of
common
law.
now,
they
say
the
facts
of
this
case
and
the
legal
questions
are
complex.
i
would
like
to
reserve
an
ample
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
because
i
think
that
i
will
have
a
lot
of
things
that
i
will
--
want
to
respond
to
in
relation
with
the
government
in
particular.
if
there
are
no
questions
by
the
court
at
this
point,
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
i
think
there's
no
question,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
what
--
i
think
we
have
to
understand
what
judge
christiansen.
judge
christiansen
considered
all
of
the
evidence
which
was
presented
including
in
particular
the
evidence
of
the
appraisal
of
the
mineral
estate
which,
if
divided
by
the
number
of
shares
involved
here,
would
have,
and
capitalize,
would
have
given
rise
to
a
damage
figure
in
excess
of
$28,000
of
share.
now,
judge
christiansen
felt
that
that
would
be
--
that
would
not
be
a
proper
result
because
of
the
position
of
those
shareholders
who
were
not
told.
and
we
--
i've
cited
his
comments
in
--
in
the
appendix
where
he
--
he
makes
reference
that
--
that
it
would
seem
unfair
to
--
to
any
such
penalize
those
who
did
not
sell
by
giving
those
less
prudent
who
did
sell
the
true
value
immediately
whereas
the
others
may
have
to
wait
that
this
may
be
(inaudible)
to
recover
that
--
that
amount.
now,
i
think
that
was
a
wise
approach.
the
trouble
with
it
is
that
it
leaves
the
benefit,
the
--
the
remaining
value
of
the
mineral
estate
in
the
hands
of
the
wrong
jurors.
and
that
was
the
very
reason
why
the
affiliated
ute
case
was
initiated.
and
that
was
initiated,
i
might
say,
prior
to
the
time
of
judgement
so
that
there
would
be
a
way
that
--
that
that
windfall
in
a
fraudulent
party
could
be
avoided
and
the
--
and
the
mineral
estate
should
be
vested
in
those
who
--
who
--
to
remain
in
mineral
estates
to
be
vested
on
those
properly
entitled
to
it.
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
i
think
that
if
the
court
were
to
grant
a
remedy
set
as
i
had
suggested,
we
would
have
to
remand
this
case
for
a
further
hearing
on
what
proper
amount
of
damages
should
be.
we
have
to
have
some
evidence
on
what
the
distributions
were
during
the
period
of
time
that
the
(inaudible)
in
those
case.
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
thank
you.
mr.
justice
douglas,
may
it
please
the
court.
before
i
get
in
to
my
argument
as
such
i
might
comment
for
the
benefit
of
mr.
justice
stewart
that
his
term
"bellwether"
is
not
a
legal
term
as
such.
it's
a
sheepherder's
term,
that's
what
it
is.
it
refers
to
the
fact
that
when
a
sheepherder
discovers
what
the
lead
sheep
is,
the
one
that
the
other
members
of
the
flock
follow
while
he
ties
a
bell
around
it,
then,
of
course,
it
--
it's
dark
or
the
weather
is
bad
or
something
of
that
sort
why
he
--
he
can
follow
the
sheep
and
this
really
is
a
procedure
which
judge
christiansen
has
device
to
--
to
handle
these
--
it's
just
another
device
to
handle
--
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
--
multiple
--
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
right.
now,
i
note
from
mr.
randolph's
argument
that
he
had
nothing
to
say
about
the
security's
aspect
of
the
case.
i
remind
the
court
however,
as
i
think
the
court
is
aware
that
securities
and
exchange
commission
has
taken
the
position
in
this
case.
i
think
it's
regrettable
that
mr.
randolph
does
not
speak
for
that
issue
because
i
know
that
this
court
has
expressly
added
to
in
the
past
and
cases
such
as
the
national
securities
case
that
it
is
not
desirable
to
decide
these
important
securities
issues
without
receiving
the
--
the
benefit
of
the
thinking
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission.
however,
they
have
appeared
by
way
of
their
amicus
brief,
and
i
invite
the
court
to
take
careful
attention
to
the
position
which
they
had
taken
and
which
i
might
say
i
should
describe
to
it
completely.
as
far
as
this
matter
of
the
--
the
legends
on
the
stock
which
mr.
bertoch
referred
to
and
indicated
the
--
that
the
stock
was
locked
up
in
the
bank
with
the
request
of
the
corporation.
i
think
this
court
ought
to
consider
for
a
moment
just
what
was
going
on
here.
why
would
they
every
--
even
put
that
legend
on
the
stock
if
it
wasn't
going
to
be
given
to
the
stockholder
and
--
so
that
he
could
read
it
and
understand
it?
why
would
they
take
the
position
that
these
people
were
fully
competent
and
--
and
capable
of
managing
their
affairs
and
--
and
that
they
should
be
held
to
the
strict
standards
of
accountability
that
mr.
randolph
would
now
like
to
impose
upon
him
and
still,
at
the
same
time,
take
the
position
that
they
weren't
even
competent
to
handle
that
piece
of
paper?
it's
almost
as
if
there
was
some
guilty
knowledge
involved
here.
it's
almost
as
if
that
legend
was
printed
on
the
stock
to
try
to
mitigate
the
--
the
circumstances
that
these
--
these
people
would
be
in
--
placed
under.
certainly,
that's
the
view
that
the
petitioners
take,
and
we
feel
that
there
was
a
complete
application
of
responsibilities
here
that
gives
rise
to
liability
on
the
part
of
both
the
bank
and
the
united
states.
now,
with
respect
to
this
matter
of
reliance,
i
don't
think
we
can
go
us
--
over
the
matter
of
reliance
as
easily
as
mr.
bertoch
would
like
to
and
say
that,
"well,
just
--
it
just
ought
to
be
an
element
of
the
rule.
it
ought
to
be
an
element
of
the
statute."
because
if
we
look
at
the
statute,
the
construction
of
the
statute
and
the
construction
of
the
rule,
it
seems
that
congress
had
a
particular
thing
in
mind.
congress,
if
it
meant
to
say
reliance,
knew
how
to
say
that
and
--
and
did
show
another
context.
i've
directed
the
court's
attention
in
my
brief
to
the
provisions
of
section
18
of
the
very
same
act
that
we're
talking
about.
now,
section
--
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
i
think
that
the
commission's
position
in
the
list
case
was
substantially
right
that
--
as
i
recall
they
took
the
position
that
--
that
it
was
not
really
a
problem
in
list
as
a
factual
matter.
i've
cited
in
my
petition
for
certiorari
at
the
brief
that
the
sec
filed
in
the
list
case
in
which
they
took
the
very
position
that
i
am
now
espousing,
which
is
that
reliance
should
not
be
an
element
because
it
leads
to
confusing
doctrine.
how
are
you
going
to
prove
the
negative
of
the
undisclosed
fact?
that's
what
mr.
bertoch
suggested
that
we
should
do
when
we
go
back
to
the
trial
court.
how
am
i
going
to
ask
one
of
these
people
if
they
--
if
they
relied
upon
something
they
didn't
know
about?
you
see,
that's
the
problem
we
get
into,
and
that's
why
reliance
is
not
an
appropriate
concept.
but
in
section
18
which
deals
with
--
with
reports
filed
with
the
commission,
there's
a
cause
of
action
that
was
prescribed
there
for
people
who
rely
upon
statements
contained
in
those
--
in
those
reports.
now,
that's
the
very
same
act.
and
in
that
context,
congress
said
that
you've
got
to
show
reliance.
also,
in
section
11
(a)
of
the
1933
securities
act,
which
this
court
has
held
is
in
pari
materia.
congress
said
that
when
a
person
brings
an
action
based
upon
a
prospectus,
he
must
show
reliance.
now,
in
this
act,
in
--
in
section
10,
congress
didn't
say
reliance,
they
substituted
something
else.
they
said,
“what
you
got
to
show
is
that
it
was
immaterial”.
and
material
is
--
is
a
very
nice
limiting
factor
too,
and
as
mr.
bertoch
has
correctly
pointed
out,
sometimes
it
means
the
same
thing
as
reliance
and
sometimes
it
doesn't.
that
--
that
is
the
term
which
congress
selected,
i
think
it's
the
one
that
this
court
should
apply.
and
i
think
that
it
isn't
the
business
of
this
court
to
be
writing
terms
into
the
statute
which
congress
didn't
put
there,
particularly
when
it
appears
in
the
context
that
congress
knew
how
to
supply
that
term,
if
they
thought
that
it
should
be
an
element
of
the
cause.
now,
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
indian
lines
aspect
of
this
case,
and
i'd
like
to
start
off
by
making
reference
to
the
dialogue
between
mr.
justice
white
and
mr.
randolph
relative
to
the
authority
for
the
establishment
of
the
ute
distribution
corporation.
mr.
randolph
indicated
that
there
was
statutory
authority
for
the
formation
of
the
ute
distribution
corporation.
i
submit
that
he
was
in
error.
there
was
no
such
statutory
authority.
section
e
--
section
677e,
which
is
the
section
which
mr.
randolph
directed
mr.
justice
white
to
does
not
provide
authority
for
--
for
a
corporation.
it
provides
authority
for
the
adoption
of
a
constitution
and
bylaws.
now,
that's
quite
a
different
thing.
a
membership
association
is
quite
a
different
thing
from
a
corporation.
a
corporation,
a
stock
in
corporation
may
be
sold.
one
cannot
sell
his
right
to
membership
in
such
unincorporated
association.
it's
almost
as
if
one
were
to
form
a
corporation
for
--
for
citizens
of
the
united
states
and
then
permit
them
to
sell
their
citizenship
to
--
to
aliens
who
would
--
who
would
come
to
this
country.
i
--
it
--
it's
--
to
me,
it's
an
absurdity,
and
i
think
that
congress
had
a
definite
thing
in
mind
and
--
and
by
substituting
the
corporation
for
the
organization
which
congress
prescribed
a
very
substantial
change
was
brought
in
the
--
in
the
statutory
scheme,
and
it
was
one
which
resulted
in
the
loss
to
these
people.
now,
mr.
randolph
said
that
it
was
approved
by
the
indians.
it
was
approved
at
a
meeting
of
a
quorum
of
30.
congress
said
that
such
an
organization
must
be
approved
at
a
special
meeting
called
for
that
purpose
by
the
secretary
and
by
a
majority
vote
of
the
adult
mixed-blood.
that
was
far
in
excess
of
30.
i'm
not
sure
exactly
what
the
number
was
but
it
was
something
like
about
140.
so
you
see,
by
--
by
substituting
the
procedures
under
the
plan
of
distribution
and
the
--
and
the
constitution
of
auc
accorded
procedures
which
congress
prescribed.
the
--
the
intent
of
congress
was
emasculated.
congress
said
a
majority
of
the
adult
mixed-bloods.
instead
of
doing
that,
they
used
the
provisions
in
the
constitution
which
permitted
the
vote
of
a
mere
30.
and
there's
another
important
thing
here
too,
mr.
justice
white,
that
i
think
ought
to
be
considered
and
that
is
--
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
constitution
and
bylaws.
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
it
doesn't.
well,
the
word
"unincorporated"
is
not
in
the
statute.
i
think
that's
a
fair
construction
of
it.
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
well,
they
used
the
term
"corporation"
in
other
sections.
i
suppose
that
if
they
meant
corporation,
again,
they
knew
how
to
say
it
and
they
said
it
in
section
13.
the
fact
that
they
said
it
in
section
13
and
they
didn't
say
it
in
section
6
is
persuasive
that
they
didn't
mean
it
in
section
6.
there's
another
--
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
that
is
correct.
and
that
gets
us
into
a
whole
different
question
which
is
--
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
--
which
in
brief.
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
yes.
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
yes.
and
that
was
provided
--
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
if
we
want
to
consider
it
in
that
way,
mr.
justice
white,
i'm
not
saying
in
that
sense
that
it's
inconsistent
with
the
statute.
i'm
saying
that
as
a
factual
matter,
it
didn't
happen
because
the
constitution
and
bylaws
provided
that
the
authorized
representative's
powers
were
those
defined
in
article
v
section
1
(a)
and
those
powers
were
never
delegated
to
anyone.
that's
--
if
--
if
those
were
the
powers,
they
still
reside
where
they're
originally
were
placed
with
the
affiliated
ute
citizens.
there
is
no
showing
that
there
is
ever
any
delegation
of
that
power.
that's
a
factual
question
however.
it's
not
a
legal
question.
but
the
point
i
wanted
to
get
to
here
which
i
think
is
maybe
more
fundamental
than
that
is
simply
this.
this
statute
provided
that
upon
publication
of
the
rolls,
every
terminated
ute
would
have
his
rights
in
severalty,
inheritable,
and
in
such
a
condition
that
they
could
be
decreed.
now,
that
section
10,
it
says
that,
it's
just
plainly
as
can
be,
thus,
at
the
time
of
this
purported
resolution,
which
mr.
randolph
refers
to,
there
was
no
power
for
the
general
membership
to
dispose
of
any
particular
person's
property
because
that
had
already
vested
in
the
individual
including
the
beneficial
interest
in
--
in
the
undivided
assets.
and
i'd
like
to
just
read
that
section
because
--
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
no.
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
the
beneficial
interest.
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
the
beneficial
interest.
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
no,
absolutely
not,
mr.
justice
white.
the
--
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
pardon
me.
i
didn't
catch
you
on
that.
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
well,
i
suppose
they
could
have
authorized
a
person
to
do
it
or
--
or
a
bank
to
do
it.
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
or
possibly
even
a
corporation
if
in
fact
they
have
done
that,
but
they
did
not.
you
see,
the
statute,
section
10
provides
that
all
unadjudicated
and
unlikefully
claims
against
the
united
states
gas,
oil
and
mineral
rights
of
every
kind
and
all
other
assets
is
not
susceptible
to
equitable
and
practical
for
distribution
shall
be
managed
jointly.
you
see,
we're
talking
about
management
powers.
we're
not
talking
about
ownership
powers.
we're
talking
about
management
powers.
the
--
the
statute
--
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
or
disposition
powers.
right.
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
not
to
dispose
of
any
individual
member's
property.
they
could
--
they
could
execute
leases
to
--
to
exploit
these
resources
but
they
had
no
power
to
dispose
of
any
individual
member's
property
because
they
didn't
know
of
it,
the
individual
member
did.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
i
--
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
--
appreciate
the
indulgence
of
the
court.
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
mr.
justice
douglas
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
matter
now
at
bar
involves
the
seemingly
unrelated
provisions
of
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934
and
the
ute
termination
act
of
1954.
these
two
seemingly
unrelated
statutes
are
drawn
into
focus
in
this
case
because
both
of
them
involved
prohibitions
against
overreaching
and
both
of
them
create
limited
fiduciary
obligations
with
respect
to
those
who
are
subject
to
their
provisions.
the
ute
termination
act
of
1954
had
the
effect
of
dividing
the
ute
indian
tribe
of
the
uintah
and
ouray
reservations
into
two
entirely
artificially
created
groups
and
directing
that
all
of
the
assets
of
the
reservations,
including
in
particular,
as
far
as
the
fact
of
this
case
are
concerned,
beneficial
interest
in
the
mineral
estate,
were
to
be
divided
between
the
two
groups
and
to
be
distributed
to
the
--
the
indians
about
to
be
terminated.
now,
i
note
in
passing
that
those
who
are
responsible
for
the
drafting
of
this
law
have
referred
to
the
group
that
was
about
to
be
terminated
as
mixed-bloods.
the
term
“mixed-blood”
is
itself
a
slur,
and
it
is
offensive
to
the
petitioners
in
this
case
who
prefer
to
be
referred
to
by
the
term
“terminated
utes”.
the
petitioner
affiliated
ute
citizens
of
the
state
of
utah
is
the
authorized
representative
of
all
the
terminated
utes,
which
was
formed
in
the
manner
specified
in
section
6
of
the
ute
termination
act
by
a
constitution
and
bylaws
which
was
duly
ratified
by
the
majority
vote
of
all
of
the
adult
terminated
utes
at
a
special
election
called
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
when
i
made
reference
to
that
circumstance,
what
i
had
in
mind
is
that
in
reality,
if
we
want
to
talk
in
terms
of
the
ancestry
of
the
indians
on
this
reservation,
all
of
them
are
indeed
mixed-bloods.
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
yes.
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
it
does,
mr.
justice
stewart,
and
my
point
simply
was
that
the
term
itself
is
offensive
to
the
petitioners
and
they
have
designated
themselves
otherwise
in
these
proceedings.
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
the
statute
that
so
provide.
no
one
in
these
proceedings
disputes
that
the
affiliated
ute
citizens
was
the
organization
which
was
formed
in
the
manner
specified
by
the
statute.
there
is,
however,
a
rival
organization,
which
we
will
discuss
in
some
detail
in
these
proceedings,
known
as
the
ute
distribution
corporation.
the
ute
distribution
corporation
is
a
corporation
formed
under
the
corporate
laws
of
the
state
of
utah.
it
was
not
formed
by
the
adoption
of
a
constitution
and
bylaws,
it
was
not
ratified
by
a
majority
vote
of
all
terminated
ute
indians
nor
was
it
considered
at
a
special
election
called
by
the
secretary
for
that
purpose.
that's
the
crux
of
the
problem
in
this
case.
these
are
the
--
these
two
rival
organizations
is
the
question
of
how
the
powers
of
the
authorized
representative
could
have
been
transferred
from
the
affiliated
ute
citizens,
who
admittedly
were
originally
invested
with
those
powers,
to
the
ute
distribution
corporation.
it
is,
thus,
a
conveyancing
problem,
plain
and
simple.
and
i
invite
the
court
to
pay
particular
attention
to
the
manner
in
which
it
is
proposed
that
those
powers
were
shifted
one
--
from
one
organization
to
the
other.
the
question
turns
on
the
definition
of
authorized
representatives
as
contained
in
the
act.
we're
not
concerned
for
the
purpose
of
that
definition
with
the
question
of
ownership
of
property.
section
10
of
the
ute
termination
act
which
is
the
section
which
defines
the
--
the
authorized
representative
powers
refers
exclusively
to
the
question
of
powers
to
manage
the
jointly
held
and
--
and
restricted
assets
of
the
two
groups
of
indians
in
the
mineral
estate.
it
does
not
speak
in
terms
of
ownership
of
property.
the
united
states
has
proposed
that
the
powers
were
transferred
from
auc
to
udc
by
virtue
of
the
provisions
of
section
13
of
the
termination
act.
section
13
by
contrast
speaks
only
and
speaks
exclusively
of
powers
with
respect
to
the
ownership
of
property.
the
joint
--
the
--
the
authorized
representative
powers
were
not
powers
that
had
any
relationship
to
the
ownership
of
property
and
in
particular,
to
the
ownership
of
property
by
the
individual
mixed-blood
or
terminated
ute
indian,
which
is
all
that
section
13
relates
to.
the
individual
petitioners
in
these
proceedings
are
members
of
the
affiliated
ute
citizens
who
have
brought
a
fraud
claim
based
upon
their
sale
of
stock
in
the
ute
distribution
corporation.
now,
for
the
purpose
of
their
fraud
claim,
and
this
distinction
must
be
kept
in
mind,
the
question
of
the
regularity
of
the
formation
of
the
ute
distribution
corporation
is
not
an
issue.
it
is
not
an
issue
because
the
proceeds
from
the
management
of
this
joint
mineral
estate
over
the
period
of
time
that
we're
here
concerned
with
has
been
paid
in
the
form
of
dividends
through
the
ute
distribution
corporation.
the
recognition
at
this
point
that
the
affiliated
ute
citizens
as
the
proper
authorized
representative
will
not
have
the
effect
of
restoring
to
the
terminated
utes
the
dividends
or
the
royalties
which
they
have
lost
by
reason
of
--
of
those
practices.
thus,
the
regularity
of
ute
distribution
corporation
is
an
issue
with
respect
to
the
affiliated
utes
part
of
the
claim,
it
is
not
an
issue
with
respect
to
the
individual
indians
fraud
claims
in
the
real
side
of
this
case.
the
defendants
in
the
fraud
claims
are
the
first
security
bank
of
utah
and
two
of
its
officers.
the
united
states
was
not
a
defendant
in
the
fraud
claims.
the
conduct
of
the
bank
and
its
officers
arises
by
reason
of
its
conduct
in
executing
its
duties
under
a
business
agent
agreement
which
contemplated
that
they
were
to
act
as
stock
transfer
agent
to
hit
the
books
and
reference
of
the
corporation
and
perform
certain
incidental
services.
it
is
the
common
element
of
the
conduct
of
the
bank
pursuant
to
that
practice
which
are
important
as
far
as
the
fraud
claims
are
concerned.
these
common
elements
affected
every
indian
sale.
it
doesn't
really
matter
who
the
sale
was
--
was
negotiated
with.
the
common
elements
affected
necessarily
affected
every
sale.
by
common
elements
i
refer
to
the
fact
that
every
indian
stock
certificate,
which
had
bold,
red
letter
legend,
warning
him
of
--
of
its
value
and
of
restrictions
on
its
transfer
were
locked
up
in
the
bank
walls
and
the
bank
refused
to
make
those
certificates
available
to
any
indian
prior
to
august
27,
1964
even
when
he
requested
them
and
made
no
alternate
effort
to
convey
the
purport
of
those
warnings
to
the
--
to
the
indian
who
desire
to
sell
his
stock.
that
practice
affected
every
indian.
the
bank
and
its
officers
were
also
acting
in
a
capacity
which
we
could
loosely
refer
to
as
a
market
making
function,
that
is
they
were
encouraging
purchasers
of
the
stock,
many
of
whom
are
located
throughout
the
united
states.
they
were
encouraging
the
--
the
sale
of
stock.
and
in
many
cases,
they
were
doing
these
things
through
the
medium
of
agents
on
both
sides.
that
practice
affected
every
indian
sale
notwithstanding
who
he
may
have
sold
to.
in
every
indian's
sale,
there
was
also
a
deviation
from
the
regulatory
provision
which
had
been
promulgated
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
specifically,
the
regulations
require
that
any
sale
must
be
by
endorsement
of
the
certificate
itself,
never
in
the
history
of
the
ute
termination
act,
at
least
prior
to
august
27,
1964,
was
a
sale
negotiated
in
that
fashion.
the
regulations
also
required
that
the
superintendent
of
the
reservation
supervise
the
price
and
the
terms
of
the
sale
according
to
the
terms
of
the
offer
which
require
payments
by
cashier's
check,
certified
check
or
postal
money
order,
never
was
a
sale
supervised
in
that
fashion.
those
practices
affected
every
indian's
transaction.
also,
the
bank
and
its
officers
neglected
and
failed
to
disclose
to
any
of
these
indians
that
they
were
acting
on
its
dual
capacity
as
market
maker
in
relation
to
the
stock.
now,
it
is
true
that
there
are
also
a
large
number
of
other
facts
which
affected
any
particular
indian
stock
and
the
petitioner
certainly
take
the
position
that
those
dissimilar
facts
standing
alone
would
be
sufficient
to
give
rise
to
a
fraud
claim.
and
the
bank,
in
its
briefs
in
this
case,
has
attempted
to
focus
on
those
dissimilar
facts.
the
petitioners
take
the
position
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
get
involve
in
the
dispute
over
whether
any
particular
indian
got
a
car,
whether
economic
pressures
were
applied
to
any
particular
indian
in
its
sole
and
what
fashion
the
economic
pressures
were
applied
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
common
elements,
which
necessarily
affected
every
transaction,
are
sufficient
to
give
rise
to
the
fraud
claims
and
were
so
determined
by
the
trial
judge.
the
claim
against
the
united
states
with
respect
to
the
sales
of
the
ute
distribution
corporation
stock
has
brought
them
on
negligence.
it
is
the
claim
of
the
petitioners
that
the
united
states
negligently
permitted
a
deviation
from
the
regulations
which
have
been
promulgated,
permitted
a
deviation
from
their
requirement
that
the
endorsement
of
the
stock
certificate
be
the
only
way
in
which
this
--
the
stock
could
be
transferred
substituted
in
its
step
the
--
the
transfer
of
the
stock
by
means
of
a
separate
stock
power.
that
may
seem
unimportant
on
the
surface
that
the
effect
of
that
deviation
from
the
regulations
was
to
withhold
from
the
indians
the
warnings
which
were
--
which
were
printed
on
that
stock
for
his
benefit.
the
united
states
also,
even
though
as
we
read
the
statute
in
regulations,
congress
plainly
directed
that
the
superintendent
was
to
regulate
the
price
in
terms
of
sale.
instead
of
doing
so,
the
superintendent
adopted
a
practice
of
--
of
receiving
a
certificate
from
the
indian
himself,
the
selling
indian
who
was
legally
in
--
in
the
position
of
a
war,
that
he
had
in
fact
received
his
--
his
money.
thus,
there
was
a
complete
application
of
the
responsibilities
of
the
united
states
in
that
regard
and
the
person
who
was
legally
in
the
position
of
the
award
was
the
one
who
the
united
states
looked
to
--
to
satisfy
those
--
those
regulatory
obligations
whereas
congress,
i
think
a
fair
reading
of
the
act
would
--
would
bear
me
out
on
this
plainly
contemplated
that
bia
should
--
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
that
is
true,
mr.
justice
marshall.
that
was
the
dominant
purpose
of
the
statute,
but
it's
also
true
that
congress
recognized
in
adopting
the
statute
as
it
did
in
all
of
the
termination
acts
that
these
people
were
going
to
have
some
trouble.
they
were
not
accustomed
to
managing
property
because
they
had
been
under
the
protective
wing
of
the
united
states
for
so
many
years,
and
so
congress
wisely,
i
think,
directed
that
there'd
be
a
face
period
three
in
which
services
and
protections
would
be
withdrawn
from
that,
and
that
that
period
was
to
extend
for
a
full
10
years.
now,
experience
was
proven
that
even
that
wasn't
enough,
that
--
that
these
people
needed
protections
even
beyond
what
congress
contemplated,
but
the
thing
we
are
here
complaining
about
is
--
is
that
the
protections
which
congress
directed
were
not
secured
to
these
people
and
that
by
reason
of
that,
they
were
deprived
of
their
property.
now,
in
many
ways,
the
complaint
of
these
petitioners
seems
based
upon
fine
distinctions
in
the
law.
we
presented
enough
a
lot
of
complex
legal
arguments
in
the
briefs.
in
reality,
however,
we're
talking
about
a
very
fundamental
proposition,
a
very
practical
and
fundamental
proposition.
we
could
analogize,
i
think,
to
a
situation
where
it
say,
a
person
were
to
buy
an
annuity
and
pay
for
it
throughout
his
life,
and
when
that
annuity
were
to
mature,
instead
of
the
insurance
company
paying
the
proceeds
of
the
annuity
to
the
annuity
simply
took
the
proceeds
and
invest
with
it
for
his
benefit
will
stay
in
a
mutual
fund.
now,
it
is
not
a
question
of
whether
that
investment
is
a
good
one
or
a
bad
one.
it's
not
a
question
in
this
case
as
to
whether
the
ute
distribution
corporation
is
a
good
idea
or
bad
idea.
it's
not
a
question
of
whether
ute
distribution
corporation
was
--
was
well
managed
or
whether
it
was
mismanaged.
the
problem
really
is
the
indignity
of
the
act
itself
to
take
a
group
of
people
such
as
these
terminated
utes
and
say
to
them
by
way
of
congressional
enactment
that
we're
going
to
remove
restrictions
on
--
on
your
person
and
on
your
property,
and
you're
going
to
be
treated
like
any
other
citizens
in
this
country
and
yet
before
that
property
ever
gets
into
that
indian's
hands
to
take
it
and
assign
it,
to
have
bia
assign
it
to
this
corporation,
and
not
only
to
assignment
but
to
make
the
assignment
or
purport
to
make
the
assignment
irrevocable
so
that
it
would
bind
himself
and
his
heirs
forever.
now,
congress
plainly
declared
in
the
statute
that
they
were
to
receive
their
property
in
such
a
fashion
that
it
could
be
inherited
and
decreed.
that
is
the
language
of
the
statute.
but
bia
attempted
to
completely
frustrate
that
--
the
congressional
intent
by
making
this
assignment
to
the
ute
distribution
corporation.
now,
turning
to
the
rule
10b-5
aspects
of
the
case,
this
case
represent
for
the
first
time
in
which
this
court
has
had
occasion
to
speak
with
reference
to
the
fundamental
ingredients
of
a
cause
of
action
under
rule
10b-5.
i
submit
that
the
case
is
a
very
good
one.
it's
a
very
good
vehicle
for
this
court
to
consider
the
elements
of
a
tried
action
under
rule
10b-5
because
of
the
wide
variety
of
misconduct
which
is
alleged
in
this
case,
which
accord
this
court
an
opportunity
to
consider
the
whole
array
of
possible
conduct
which
could
be
considered
as
a
violation
of
rule
10b-5.
it's
also
a
good
vehicle
because
the
petitioners
themselves
have
a
peculiar
need
for
the
sort
of
protection
which
were
afforded
under
rule
10b-5.
and
this
court,
many
times
in
the
past,
in
the
capital
gains
case
and
--
and
other
cases
which
it
has
considered
on
--
on
related
issues
have
said
that
the
need
for
investor
protection
is
a
relevant
consideration
which
should
be
taken
into
account
in
determining
whether
any
particular
factual
situation
falls
within
the
proscription
of
rule
10b-5.
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
not
for
the
rule
10b-5
claim,
not
for
the
fraud
claim.
the
federal
court
of
that
is
with
exclusive
jurisdiction
under
the
exchange
act
of
a
cause
of
action
under
rule
10b-5.
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
there
is
no
other
claim
(inaudible)
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
i
don't
think
that
--
well
--
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
i
suppose
it
would
have
been
possible
for
them
between
(inaudible)
on
the
fraud
claim.
i
think
that
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
bring
in
indian
law
claims
in
the
state
court
even
with
respect
to
the
state
(inaudible)
however
the
--
the
very
reason
that
most
of
these
security
fraud
cases
wind
up
in
the
federal
court
is
because
the
remedy
under
the
state
(inaudible)
is
inadequate.
it's
inadequate
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
states
are
played
with
short
statutes
of
limitations,
which
frequently
bar
fraud
claimant.
secondly,
the
state
procedure
affords
the
opportunity
for
devices
such
as
nonresident
cash
funds
and
things
of
this
sort
which
are
--
which
are
employed
by
defense
attorneys
(inaudible)
to
bring
in
a
legitimate
claim.
and
so,
in
general,
as
a
practical
matter,
we
suggest
that
as
--
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
no,
i
don't
suggest
that.
now,
as
i
read
rule
10b-5,
it
basically
requires
inhibition
to
the
jurisdictional
elements,
the
showing
of
two
elements.
and
they
are
as
follows.
first
of
all,
there
must
be
one
or
two
prohibited
acts,
that
is
there
must
be
in
their
brief
a
(inaudible)
or
there
must
be
a
misstatement
of
a
material
fact
or
omission
of
statement
of
material
facts
or
a
course
of
business
which
is
preclude
might
be
build
in
a
fraud.
secondly,
that
conduct,
whatever
it
might
be,
must
be
accomplished
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
a
security.
now,
i
stress
the
words
“in
connection
with”
because,
as
professor
bromberg
has
said
in
his
credos
on
the
subject
of
rule
10b-5,
the
words
“in
connection
with”
are
elusive
and
we
assume
intentionally
elusive
(inaudible)
which
is
prescribed
in
any
of
the
federal
security
laws.
section
17
(a)
of
the
1933
securities
act,
for
example,
uses
the
term
the
fraudulent
practice
which
is
substantially
the
same
must
be
in
the
offer
or
sale
of
a
security.
it
must
be
in
the
offer
or
sale.
this
act
says
“in
connection
with
the
offer
or
sale
of
a
security”.
the
lower
federal
court
in
--
during
the
period
of
time
that
implied
liability
have
been
developing
under
the
exchange
act,
section
10
and
rule
10b-5
have
wrestled
with
the
question
of
whether
additional
elements
may
be
engrafted
on
to
those
prescribed
by
the
rule.
they
have
considered
a
wide
assortment
of
additional
element
including
scienter,
proximate
cause,
reliance,
i've
incurred
the
principle,
one
could
say
it's
considered.
the
error
of
the
court
below
in
this
case
was
that
it
went
far
beyond
even
what
has
been
required
in
--
in
other
courts
which
have
considered
the
elements
and
required
in
this
case
that
there
be
a
direct
participation
as
a
purchaser
or
a
seller
and
that
that
direct
participation
must
be
for
a
promise.
thus,
the
lower
court
in
this
case
imposed
upon
these
plaintiffs
a
standard
which
is
far
higher
than
even
that
which
is
described
in
section
17
(a)
of
the
1933
securities
act,
and
i
might
add,
even
higher
than
was
required
at
common
law.
we
submit
that
the
limiting
factors
which
are
prescribed
in
the
statute
and
rule
itself
are
entirely
adequate
and
are
the
only
ones
which
ought
to
be
considered.
i
refer
in
particular
to
the
requirement
of
a
suing
of
materiality.
the
respondent
bank
itself
is
no
different
that
even
the
court,
which
talk
in
terms
of
reliance,
quite
often
sum
up
defining
reliance
so
that
it
comes
out
sounding
just
about
like
materiality.
the
other
limiting
factor
which
was
prescribed
by
the
statute
and
rule
is
that
of
causation.
i
note
that
the
rule
itself
does
not
meet
the
term
"causation"
but
i
have
cited
some
legislative
history
in
my
brief
which
would
indicate
that
congress
in
considering
the
1934
act
did
make
reference
to
the
fact
that
any
person
who
is
injured
by
these
practices
or
whose
injury
was
caused
by
these
practices
ought
to
be
able
to
recover
and
therefore
i
submit
with
causation
in
the
(inaudible)
sense
would
be
an
appropriate
limiting
factor.
i
think
that
that
instruction
has
borne
out
by
the
language
of
the
act,
and
i
know
them
particularly
within
this
act,
congress
attempted
to
proscribe
any
misconduct
(inaudible)
which
is
defined
by
the
rule
in
connection
with
any
purchase
or
sale
of
security.
i
think
the
use
of
the
term
"any"
in
both
of
those
contexts
were
the
calculated
one
and
that
it
should
be
given
effect.
as
i
say
the
common
law
in
cases
most
analogous
to
the
fact
now
it
bar
does
not
impose
a
requirement
nearly
as
high
as
that
required
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
i
cited
in
my
brief
the
common
law
deceit
cases
which
were
--
which
arose
in
the
contract
of
market
sales
of
securities.
and
what
those
cases
stand
for?
and
also
some
writings
of
professor
thompson
denoted
expert
on
corporation.
what
those
cases
stand
for
is
the
proposition
that
if
a
person
makes
a
misstatement
were
played
by
--
by
means
of
a
prospective
and
he
distributes
--
distributes
it
to
the
public
at
large
in
one
case
that
was
cited
by
means
of
leaving
it
at
a
bank
so
that
any
member
of
the
public
could
pick
it
up
and
read
it.
if
there
are
lies
in
that
prospective,
any
member
in
particular
should
be
permitted
to
recover
because
it
was
directed
to
any
member
of
the
public
thus,
they
come
within
the
ambit
of
responsibility
by
contracts
of
the
misrepresentation
was
made
to
a
limited
group
why
then
also
the
ambit
of
responsibility
which
refer
to
be
restricted.
that
was
the
rule
at
the
common
law
and
it
is
universally
recognized
that
rule
10b-5
is
an
expansion
of
--
of
the
common
law
and
therefore,
i
submit
that
we
should
at
least
read
this
rule
as
broadly
as
the
provision
of
common
law.
now,
they
say
the
facts
of
this
case
and
the
legal
questions
are
complex.
i
would
like
to
reserve
an
ample
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
because
i
think
that
i
will
have
a
lot
of
things
that
i
will
--
want
to
respond
to
in
relation
with
the
government
in
particular.
if
there
are
no
questions
by
the
court
at
this
point,
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
i
think
there's
no
question,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
what
--
i
think
we
have
to
understand
what
judge
christiansen.
judge
christiansen
considered
all
of
the
evidence
which
was
presented
including
in
particular
the
evidence
of
the
appraisal
of
the
mineral
estate
which,
if
divided
by
the
number
of
shares
involved
here,
would
have,
and
capitalize,
would
have
given
rise
to
a
damage
figure
in
excess
of
$28,000
of
share.
now,
judge
christiansen
felt
that
that
would
be
--
that
would
not
be
a
proper
result
because
of
the
position
of
those
shareholders
who
were
not
told.
and
we
--
i've
cited
his
comments
in
--
in
the
appendix
where
he
--
he
makes
reference
that
--
that
it
would
seem
unfair
to
--
to
any
such
penalize
those
who
did
not
sell
by
giving
those
less
prudent
who
did
sell
the
true
value
immediately
whereas
the
others
may
have
to
wait
that
this
may
be
(inaudible)
to
recover
that
--
that
amount.
now,
i
think
that
was
a
wise
approach.
the
trouble
with
it
is
that
it
leaves
the
benefit,
the
--
the
remaining
value
of
the
mineral
estate
in
the
hands
of
the
wrong
jurors.
and
that
was
the
very
reason
why
the
affiliated
ute
case
was
initiated.
and
that
was
initiated,
i
might
say,
prior
to
the
time
of
judgement
so
that
there
would
be
a
way
that
--
that
that
windfall
in
a
fraudulent
party
could
be
avoided
and
the
--
and
the
mineral
estate
should
be
vested
in
those
who
--
who
--
to
remain
in
mineral
estates
to
be
vested
on
those
properly
entitled
to
it.
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
i
think
that
if
the
court
were
to
grant
a
remedy
set
as
i
had
suggested,
we
would
have
to
remand
this
case
for
a
further
hearing
on
what
proper
amount
of
damages
should
be.
we
have
to
have
some
evidence
on
what
the
distributions
were
during
the
period
of
time
that
the
(inaudible)
in
those
case.
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
thank
you.
mr.
justice
douglas,
may
it
please
the
court.
before
i
get
in
to
my
argument
as
such
i
might
comment
for
the
benefit
of
mr.
justice
stewart
that
his
term
"bellwether"
is
not
a
legal
term
as
such.
it's
a
sheepherder's
term,
that's
what
it
is.
it
refers
to
the
fact
that
when
a
sheepherder
discovers
what
the
lead
sheep
is,
the
one
that
the
other
members
of
the
flock
follow
while
he
ties
a
bell
around
it,
then,
of
course,
it
--
it's
dark
or
the
weather
is
bad
or
something
of
that
sort
why
he
--
he
can
follow
the
sheep
and
this
really
is
a
procedure
which
judge
christiansen
has
device
to
--
to
handle
these
--
it's
just
another
device
to
handle
--
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
--
multiple
--
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
right.
now,
i
note
from
mr.
randolph's
argument
that
he
had
nothing
to
say
about
the
security's
aspect
of
the
case.
i
remind
the
court
however,
as
i
think
the
court
is
aware
that
securities
and
exchange
commission
has
taken
the
position
in
this
case.
i
think
it's
regrettable
that
mr.
randolph
does
not
speak
for
that
issue
because
i
know
that
this
court
has
expressly
added
to
in
the
past
and
cases
such
as
the
national
securities
case
that
it
is
not
desirable
to
decide
these
important
securities
issues
without
receiving
the
--
the
benefit
of
the
thinking
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission.
however,
they
have
appeared
by
way
of
their
amicus
brief,
and
i
invite
the
court
to
take
careful
attention
to
the
position
which
they
had
taken
and
which
i
might
say
i
should
describe
to
it
completely.
as
far
as
this
matter
of
the
--
the
legends
on
the
stock
which
mr.
bertoch
referred
to
and
indicated
the
--
that
the
stock
was
locked
up
in
the
bank
with
the
request
of
the
corporation.
i
think
this
court
ought
to
consider
for
a
moment
just
what
was
going
on
here.
why
would
they
every
--
even
put
that
legend
on
the
stock
if
it
wasn't
going
to
be
given
to
the
stockholder
and
--
so
that
he
could
read
it
and
understand
it?
why
would
they
take
the
position
that
these
people
were
fully
competent
and
--
and
capable
of
managing
their
affairs
and
--
and
that
they
should
be
held
to
the
strict
standards
of
accountability
that
mr.
randolph
would
now
like
to
impose
upon
him
and
still,
at
the
same
time,
take
the
position
that
they
weren't
even
competent
to
handle
that
piece
of
paper?
it's
almost
as
if
there
was
some
guilty
knowledge
involved
here.
it's
almost
as
if
that
legend
was
printed
on
the
stock
to
try
to
mitigate
the
--
the
circumstances
that
these
--
these
people
would
be
in
--
placed
under.
certainly,
that's
the
view
that
the
petitioners
take,
and
we
feel
that
there
was
a
complete
application
of
responsibilities
here
that
gives
rise
to
liability
on
the
part
of
both
the
bank
and
the
united
states.
now,
with
respect
to
this
matter
of
reliance,
i
don't
think
we
can
go
us
--
over
the
matter
of
reliance
as
easily
as
mr.
bertoch
would
like
to
and
say
that,
"well,
just
--
it
just
ought
to
be
an
element
of
the
rule.
it
ought
to
be
an
element
of
the
statute."
because
if
we
look
at
the
statute,
the
construction
of
the
statute
and
the
construction
of
the
rule,
it
seems
that
congress
had
a
particular
thing
in
mind.
congress,
if
it
meant
to
say
reliance,
knew
how
to
say
that
and
--
and
did
show
another
context.
i've
directed
the
court's
attention
in
my
brief
to
the
provisions
of
section
18
of
the
very
same
act
that
we're
talking
about.
now,
section
--
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
i
think
that
the
commission's
position
in
the
list
case
was
substantially
right
that
--
as
i
recall
they
took
the
position
that
--
that
it
was
not
really
a
problem
in
list
as
a
factual
matter.
i've
cited
in
my
petition
for
certiorari
at
the
brief
that
the
sec
filed
in
the
list
case
in
which
they
took
the
very
position
that
i
am
now
espousing,
which
is
that
reliance
should
not
be
an
element
because
it
leads
to
confusing
doctrine.
how
are
you
going
to
prove
the
negative
of
the
undisclosed
fact?
that's
what
mr.
bertoch
suggested
that
we
should
do
when
we
go
back
to
the
trial
court.
how
am
i
going
to
ask
one
of
these
people
if
they
--
if
they
relied
upon
something
they
didn't
know
about?
you
see,
that's
the
problem
we
get
into,
and
that's
why
reliance
is
not
an
appropriate
concept.
but
in
section
18
which
deals
with
--
with
reports
filed
with
the
commission,
there's
a
cause
of
action
that
was
prescribed
there
for
people
who
rely
upon
statements
contained
in
those
--
in
those
reports.
now,
that's
the
very
same
act.
and
in
that
context,
congress
said
that
you've
got
to
show
reliance.
also,
in
section
11
(a)
of
the
1933
securities
act,
which
this
court
has
held
is
in
pari
materia.
congress
said
that
when
a
person
brings
an
action
based
upon
a
prospectus,
he
must
show
reliance.
now,
in
this
act,
in
--
in
section
10,
congress
didn't
say
reliance,
they
substituted
something
else.
they
said,
“what
you
got
to
show
is
that
it
was
immaterial”.
and
material
is
--
is
a
very
nice
limiting
factor
too,
and
as
mr.
bertoch
has
correctly
pointed
out,
sometimes
it
means
the
same
thing
as
reliance
and
sometimes
it
doesn't.
that
--
that
is
the
term
which
congress
selected,
i
think
it's
the
one
that
this
court
should
apply.
and
i
think
that
it
isn't
the
business
of
this
court
to
be
writing
terms
into
the
statute
which
congress
didn't
put
there,
particularly
when
it
appears
in
the
context
that
congress
knew
how
to
supply
that
term,
if
they
thought
that
it
should
be
an
element
of
the
cause.
now,
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
indian
lines
aspect
of
this
case,
and
i'd
like
to
start
off
by
making
reference
to
the
dialogue
between
mr.
justice
white
and
mr.
randolph
relative
to
the
authority
for
the
establishment
of
the
ute
distribution
corporation.
mr.
randolph
indicated
that
there
was
statutory
authority
for
the
formation
of
the
ute
distribution
corporation.
i
submit
that
he
was
in
error.
there
was
no
such
statutory
authority.
section
e
--
section
677e,
which
is
the
section
which
mr.
randolph
directed
mr.
justice
white
to
does
not
provide
authority
for
--
for
a
corporation.
it
provides
authority
for
the
adoption
of
a
constitution
and
bylaws.
now,
that's
quite
a
different
thing.
a
membership
association
is
quite
a
different
thing
from
a
corporation.
a
corporation,
a
stock
in
corporation
may
be
sold.
one
cannot
sell
his
right
to
membership
in
such
unincorporated
association.
it's
almost
as
if
one
were
to
form
a
corporation
for
--
for
citizens
of
the
united
states
and
then
permit
them
to
sell
their
citizenship
to
--
to
aliens
who
would
--
who
would
come
to
this
country.
i
--
it
--
it's
--
to
me,
it's
an
absurdity,
and
i
think
that
congress
had
a
definite
thing
in
mind
and
--
and
by
substituting
the
corporation
for
the
organization
which
congress
prescribed
a
very
substantial
change
was
brought
in
the
--
in
the
statutory
scheme,
and
it
was
one
which
resulted
in
the
loss
to
these
people.
now,
mr.
randolph
said
that
it
was
approved
by
the
indians.
it
was
approved
at
a
meeting
of
a
quorum
of
30.
congress
said
that
such
an
organization
must
be
approved
at
a
special
meeting
called
for
that
purpose
by
the
secretary
and
by
a
majority
vote
of
the
adult
mixed-blood.
that
was
far
in
excess
of
30.
i'm
not
sure
exactly
what
the
number
was
but
it
was
something
like
about
140.
so
you
see,
by
--
by
substituting
the
procedures
under
the
plan
of
distribution
and
the
--
and
the
constitution
of
auc
accorded
procedures
which
congress
prescribed.
the
--
the
intent
of
congress
was
emasculated.
congress
said
a
majority
of
the
adult
mixed-bloods.
instead
of
doing
that,
they
used
the
provisions
in
the
constitution
which
permitted
the
vote
of
a
mere
30.
and
there's
another
important
thing
here
too,
mr.
justice
white,
that
i
think
ought
to
be
considered
and
that
is
--
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
constitution
and
bylaws.
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
it
doesn't.
well,
the
word
"unincorporated"
is
not
in
the
statute.
i
think
that's
a
fair
construction
of
it.
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
well,
they
used
the
term
"corporation"
in
other
sections.
i
suppose
that
if
they
meant
corporation,
again,
they
knew
how
to
say
it
and
they
said
it
in
section
13.
the
fact
that
they
said
it
in
section
13
and
they
didn't
say
it
in
section
6
is
persuasive
that
they
didn't
mean
it
in
section
6.
there's
another
--
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
that
is
correct.
and
that
gets
us
into
a
whole
different
question
which
is
--
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
--
which
in
brief.
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
yes.
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
yes.
and
that
was
provided
--
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
if
we
want
to
consider
it
in
that
way,
mr.
justice
white,
i'm
not
saying
in
that
sense
that
it's
inconsistent
with
the
statute.
i'm
saying
that
as
a
factual
matter,
it
didn't
happen
because
the
constitution
and
bylaws
provided
that
the
authorized
representative's
powers
were
those
defined
in
article
v
section
1
(a)
and
those
powers
were
never
delegated
to
anyone.
that's
--
if
--
if
those
were
the
powers,
they
still
reside
where
they're
originally
were
placed
with
the
affiliated
ute
citizens.
there
is
no
showing
that
there
is
ever
any
delegation
of
that
power.
that's
a
factual
question
however.
it's
not
a
legal
question.
but
the
point
i
wanted
to
get
to
here
which
i
think
is
maybe
more
fundamental
than
that
is
simply
this.
this
statute
provided
that
upon
publication
of
the
rolls,
every
terminated
ute
would
have
his
rights
in
severalty,
inheritable,
and
in
such
a
condition
that
they
could
be
decreed.
now,
that
section
10,
it
says
that,
it's
just
plainly
as
can
be,
thus,
at
the
time
of
this
purported
resolution,
which
mr.
randolph
refers
to,
there
was
no
power
for
the
general
membership
to
dispose
of
any
particular
person's
property
because
that
had
already
vested
in
the
individual
including
the
beneficial
interest
in
--
in
the
undivided
assets.
and
i'd
like
to
just
read
that
section
because
--
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
no.
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
the
beneficial
interest.
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
the
beneficial
interest.
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
no,
absolutely
not,
mr.
justice
white.
the
--
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
pardon
me.
i
didn't
catch
you
on
that.
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
well,
i
suppose
they
could
have
authorized
a
person
to
do
it
or
--
or
a
bank
to
do
it.
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
or
possibly
even
a
corporation
if
in
fact
they
have
done
that,
but
they
did
not.
you
see,
the
statute,
section
10
provides
that
all
unadjudicated
and
unlikefully
claims
against
the
united
states
gas,
oil
and
mineral
rights
of
every
kind
and
all
other
assets
is
not
susceptible
to
equitable
and
practical
for
distribution
shall
be
managed
jointly.
you
see,
we're
talking
about
management
powers.
we're
not
talking
about
ownership
powers.
we're
talking
about
management
powers.
the
--
the
statute
--
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
or
disposition
powers.
right.
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
not
to
dispose
of
any
individual
member's
property.
they
could
--
they
could
execute
leases
to
--
to
exploit
these
resources
but
they
had
no
power
to
dispose
of
any
individual
member's
property
because
they
didn't
know
of
it,
the
individual
member
did.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
i
--
mr.
parker
m.
nielson
--
appreciate
the
indulgence
of
the
court.
