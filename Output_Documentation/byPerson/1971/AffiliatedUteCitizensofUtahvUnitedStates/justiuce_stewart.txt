mr.
justiuce
stewart
why
the
statute
of
course,
talks
about
mixed-blood
and
the
only
terminated
utes
are
those
who
were
referred
to
in
the
statute
as
mixed-blood,
isn't
that
correct?
mr.
justiuce
stewart
(voice
overlap)
talking?
i
thought
it
might
helpful
to
talk
in
terms
of
the
statute.
mr.
justiuce
stewart
and
the
statute
does
use
that
phrase
throughout.
mr.
justiuce
stewart
they
have
the
right
recognition
that
the
stock
wouldn't
have
any
value.
mr.
justiuce
stewart
(inaudible)
on
this
right
of
first
refusal,
i'm
looking
for
summary
of
your
argument
on
page
23
of
your
brief.
before
a
mixed-blood
could
his
stock
to
a
non-member
of
ute
indian
tribe,
he
was
required
first
to
offer
the
stock
to
members
of
the
tribe
at
a
price
not
less
than
that
to
which
he
intended
to
sell
to
the
outsider?
mr.
justiuce
stewart
shouldn't
that
be
not
more?
mr.
justiuce
stewart
not
more,
isn't
it?
mr.
justiuce
stewart
he
could
--
he
could
not
sell
it
to
an
outsider
for
less.
mr.
justiuce
stewart
so
may
i
(inaudible)
changing
that
percent
(inaudible)
mr.
justiuce
stewart
thank
you.
mr.
justiuce
stewart
he
bought
(inaudible)
mr.
justiuce
stewart
(inaudible)
mr.
justiuce
stewart
and
how
did
all
these
used
car
dealers
(inaudible)
mr.
justiuce
stewart
there
were
a
total
of
113
individual
non-indian
buyers
of

stock
over
the
period
involved
definitely.
mr.
justiuce
stewart

justiuce
stewart
so
a
total
of
32
buyers.
mr.
justiuce
stewart
non-indian
buyers.
mr.
justiuce
stewart
and
the
--
the
buyers
were
not

locality,
instead
they
were
--
some
of
them
from
elsewhere
of
united
states.
mr.
justiuce
stewart
how
far
away
is
that
(inaudible)
mr.
justiuce
stewart
how
--
mr.
justiuce
stewart
--
how
would
people
that
far
away
likely
to
know
about
these
availability
of
shares
of
stocks?
mr.
justiuce
stewart
but
the
--
mr.
justiuce
stewart
but
allegations
with
the
bank
and
its
employees
that
made
a
market
for
this,
is
it
not?
mr.
justiuce
stewart
is
there
any
--
is
there
any
showing
of
how
somebody
in
illinois
would
know
about
the
availability
of
the
(inaudible)
obtain
stock
of
sale
on
little
village
and
little

in
utah?
mr.
justiuce
stewart

stewart
this
was
--
and
the
--
and
the
district

decided
it
was
not
a
proper
class
action.
mr.
justiuce
stewart
but
they
did
have
common
--
good
many
common
issues
and
they
--
mr.
justiuce
stewart
i
just
--
how
--
how
is
the
--
the
bellwether
--
bellwether
cases
somewhere

individual
case
of
class
action?
mr.
justiuce
stewart
cattleman
(voice
