mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
mr.
justice
douglas
and
if
the
court
please.
i
represent
the
respondent,
the
bank
and
the
two
individuals
who
are
employed
by
the
bank,
gale
and
haslem.of
course,
it
is
our
desire
that
this
court
sustained
the
decision
of
the
united
states
circuit
court
of
appeals.
one
difficulty
in
this
case
in
getting
a
(inaudible)
that
counsel
for
the
plaintiff
and
now
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
in
connection
with
--
with
its
brief
has
constructed
hypothetical
facts
that
do
not
relate
to
the
particular
individuals,
who
were
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
there
is
a
suggestion,
was
made
here
today
seems
to
be
that
somehow
we
(inaudible)
offered
sale
with
some
kind
of
fraudulent
(inaudible)
which
is
(inaudible)
had
this
--
this
stock
or
sale
by
all
of
the
mixed-blood.
and
the
question,
of
course,
was
whether
or
not,
gale
and
haslem
are
employees
violated
10b-5.
and
the
only
way
whether
that
can
be
ascertained
and
whether
or
not
that
affected,
whether
it
caused
damage
to
any
of
these
12
petitioners
is
to
be
found
in
the
fact
and
the
law
related
to
those
12
individuals
which
is
not
to
be
found
out
here
in
abstract
(inaudible)
plaintiffs'
counsel
or
petitioners'
counsel
have
insistently
and
repeatedly
tailored
a
--
a
code
of
many
odious
colors
which
has
never
been
worn
by
and
which
does
not
fit
any
of
the
particular
petitioners
in
this
lawsuit.
so
i
can
only
appeal
to
the
court
in
deciding
this
case
has
been
only
be
determined
whether
or
not
these
12
individuals
has
--
have
been
injured
or
any
of
them
have
been
caused
damage
because
of
the
violation
can
be
divided
by
examining
the
facts
and
the
law
with
respect
to
each
one
of
those
individuals.
now,
let's
go
to
the
act
which
have
been
considered
--
which
may
have
been
considered
violative
of
10b-5.
today,
with
respect
to
the
wrongful
acts
of
the
facts
or
the
corporate
--
corporate
itself,
my
friend
and
colleague
mr.
nielson
has
said
that
they
retained
these
stock
(inaudible)
whether
its
(inaudible)
or
the
indians
couldn't
read,
the
mixed-bloods
couldn't
read
this
notation
on
it
that
they
--
that
have
been
(inaudible)
well,
of
course,
that
was
done
by
the
bank
at
the
request
of
the
ute
distribution
corporation
at
the
request
of
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs,
the
agreement
of
all
three
believing
that
would
be
helpful
to
the
indians
so
they
wouldn't
loose
those
shares
of
stocks.
that
is
hardly
thought
in
having
this
part
of
its
allusion
of
fraud
which
(inaudible)
as
far
as
the
market
making
is
concerned,
which
has
been
mentioned,
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
specifically
said
there
was
no
evidence
with
the
bank,
did
anything
about
making
markets.
and
on
these
general
matters
where
it
is
of
no
help
to
this
court
and
mr.
nielson,
and
i
just
stand
up
here
and
he
said
he
did
and
i
say
he
didn't.
all
he
and
i
can
do
is
refer
you
to
the
record
and
that
is
what
i
do,
i
just
categorically
deny
that
--
that
there
--
all
these
actions
by
the
government
which
created
an
atmosphere
of
fraud.
well,
let's
talk
about
specific
things
that
even
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
said
they're
--
they
did
post
a
possibility
of
violation
of
10b-5
in
connection
of
the
action
with
a
couple
of
these
--
of
these
petitioners.
and
i
think
we
ought
to
examine
those.
and
i'm
willing
to
examine
those
words
that
where
the
circuit
court
said
"maybe
you
did,
your
man
did
violate
section
10b-5.
let's
take
mr.
gale,
it
should
be
kept
in
mind
first
of
all
that
there'd
be
12
petitioners.
mr.
gale
bought
stocks
in
only
two.
he
bought
five
shares
from
mr.
reed,
five
shares
from
mrs.
wopsock
and
that's
all
he
bought.
with
respect
to
the
other
(inaudible)
he
didn't
buy
any
shares
of
the.
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
encouraging
the
sale
with
participation
in
the
sale
of
getting
some
benefits
in
the
sale,
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
them
except
in
connection
with
some
of
them,
he
signed
and
notarized
an
affidavit
or
he's
--
he
(inaudible)
you
see
the
signature
on
top
of.
and
that's
all
he
had
to
do
with
them.
some
of
them,
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
them
or
didn't
even
know
about
it.
in
regard
to
mr.
haslem
on
the
other
hand,
he
bought
some
only
two
of
them.
one
of
them
was
again
mr.
reed,
he
bought
his
other
five
shares
from
--
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
mr.
glen
reed.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
that's
principle.
yes.
of
course
now,
these
were
bought
to
the
banks
and
sold
with
the
bank,
then
there's
nothing
on.
he
bought
--
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
well,
the
used
car
dealers
got
in
the
picture
on
their
own.
and
there
were
many
car
dealers
in
on
the
picture.
of
these
approximately
1500
shares
of
stocks
sold
and
it
very
existed
during
in
54
and
55
(inaudible)
that
we're
--
we're
dealing
with
the
1500
shares
of
stock
sold.
there
were
32
different
white
men
who
--
who
purchased
stocks.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
gale
and
haslem
bought
115
shares
put
them
together.
only
8.3%
of
all
those
who
were
bought
sold.
what's
in
this
--
the
used
car
dealers.
now,
the
end
of
this
doesn't
show
whether
the
car
dealers
themselves
committed
fraud
on
these
people.
they
--
they
may
have
done.
the
record
doesn't
show
that
these
used
car
dealers
paid
the
money
and
--
and
ran,
got
out
of
the
case,
settled
out
of
the
case.
so
we
cannot
say
that
it
may
well
be
from
these
used
car
people
(inaudible)
some
of
this
people
or
some
of
their
stock
and
gave
them
less
desirable
consideration.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
no.
there
were
32
non-indian
buyers
that
i
know
of.
there
were
113
shares
of
stock
bought
by
gale
and
haslem.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
out
of
1300
shares
that
were
sold
by
the
mixed-bloods.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
right.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
that's
right.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
yes.
i
think
the
record
shows
that
were
about
seven
of
them
who
were
outside
of
utah.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
one
from
illinois,
one
from
new
orleans,
one
from
arizona,
several
from
colorado.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
(inaudible)
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
i
don't
know.
they
may
have
known
from
relatives,
you
see
it
wasn't
the
bank
who
advertised
it.
i
don't
know
how
these
people
found
out.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
i
know
that
some
of
them
came
in
and
they
contacted
the
bank
and
said
the
bank
(inaudible)
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
yes.
and
--
and
we
submit
that
that
has
--
has
got
them
involved
and
the
record
will
not
support
it
and
the
circuit
said
that
considerably
at
(inaudible)
the
record
does
not
support
contention
of
the
fact
as
a
market
method.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
i
don't
know
how
the
man
in
illinois
knew
about
it.
it's
maybe
in
the
record,
your
honor
but
i
don't
know.
now,
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
said
that
(inaudible)
in
connection
with
the
sale,
purchase
of
this
five
shares
of
stock
with
mr.
reed.
i'm
asking
it
because
i
think
this
is
my
--
my
most
dangerous
case,
a
violation
of
case.
that
when
he
bought
fives
shares
in
january,
the
circuit
court
is
to
made
both
on
this
representation
and
perhaps
a
nondisclosure.
he
bought
the
shares
for
$350
and
he
sold
them
sometime
later
to
another
white
man
one
for
$530
who
spend
share.
now,
the
circuit
says,
and
i
certainly
want
(inaudible)
said,
"there
is
in
effect
a
misrepresentation
here
because
he
indicated
that
this
man,
reed,
has
certainly
applied
the
$350
worth
of
market."
the
value
of
the
stock
at
that
time
when
it
wasn't
because
it's
(inaudible)
sell
up
for
$530
and
maybe
guilty
of
nondisclosure
because
he
did
not
reveal
from
mr.
reed
that
he
was
going
to
sell
--
that
he
is
going
to
sell
it
later
for
$530.
now,
this
is
no
worst
case,
then
the
circuit
said,
"however,
there
is
no
evidence
even
if
this
is
a
misrepresentation
of
a
nondisclosure
which
would
be
in
violation
of
10b-5.
there's
no
evidence
that
there
was
reliance
here,
that
this
was
the
cause
of
misrepresentation
or
this
non-disclosure
was
the
cause
of
the
sale."
now,
that
--
of
the
one
--
was
that
--
accept
i
want
to
put
haslem
in
--
in
focus
hereto
because
there
is
something
that
he
did,
the
circuit
said
(inaudible)
was
in
a
violation.
they
said
that
if
haslem
indicated
when
he
purchased
some
stock,
but
that
was
the
market
price,
he
made
a
misrepresentation.
however,
with
haslem,
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
he
ever
sold
it
to
anybody
else
at
any
profit.
so
they
cannot
be
found
to
be
a
violation
of
10b-5
as
far
as
she
is
concerned.
then
i
was
going
back
to
mr.
gale.
the
question
we
get
down
to
the
real
question
in
place
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
and
that
is
the
subject
to
go
on.
now,
i
think
we
all
get
down
(inaudible)
is
the
real
bonus
concession
in
this
matter.
first,
of
course,
i
wanted
to
say
about
reliance.
is
reliance
to
be
--
to
be
assumed
if
the
representation
or
the
nondisclosure
is
material?
now,
the
reason
about,
i
believe,
because
of
the
case
mills
versus
auto-lite,
this
is
a
case
in
which
--
decided
by
this
court
last
year
and
that
the
case
which
reserved
the
tension
on
as
such.
it
is
a
case
in
which
--
which
i
believe
is
right
and
with
which
i
do
not
coil
it
up.
and
the
satisfaction
is
entirely
different
in
that
case
and
this
one.
and
the
other
like
case
you
will
recall
is
the
matter
of
miner
stockholder
suing
a
class
to
set
aside
a
merger
on
the
grounds
that
a
statement
and
a
proxy
--
proxy
statement
was
--
was
hailed
to
disclose
that
those
of
the
selling
--
of
the
merging
corporation,
the
directors
in
the
merging
corporation
sent
out
proxy
were
completely
controlled
by
the
court
relation
into
which
it
was
to
be
merged.
and
so
the
lower
court
--
well,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
were
thousands,
according
to
justice
harlan's
opinion,
there
were
thousands
of
stockholders
involved
and
these
are
minority
stockholders.
and
the
problem
was
in
the
trial
and
in
the
circuit
court,
how
we're
going
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
relied
on
the
nondisclosure
that
they
were
influenced
by
the
nondisclosure
in
the
proper
statement.
whether
or
not
they
would
have
voted
otherwise
had
this
fact
been
included
in
that
circuit.
and
the
circuit
court
and
the
trial
came
up
with
rather
fictitious
formula
saying,
"well,
this
is
the
tough
thing
to
do
because
there
are
thousands
and
they
came
in
inquiring
for
just
relying
to
each
one
causation
with
each
one,
we
--
so
we'll
adopt
its
formula.
if
it
appears
from
the
evidence
that
the
merger
was
a
good
move,
then
we
can
assume
that
if
they
had
known
all
of
the
facts,
they
would
have
bought
it.
well,
this
court,
and
i
think
quite
properly
said
that
doesn't
improve
anything
and
we're
not
going
to
accept
that
formula.
and
this
court
said
--
and
this,
i
think,
as
justice
harlan
was
done
exactly
quoting
the
circuit
court.
he
said
that
reliance
of
thousands
can
scarcely
--
can
scarcely
be
inquired
inquiry.
so
this
court
decided
that
a
case
like
that
where
the
nondisclosure
was
something
that
everybody
knew
and
knew
what
it
was,
where
it
was,
certainly
material.
or
the
court
said,
justice
harlan
said
had
a
(inaudible)
it
caused
someone
to
vote
one
way
or
another,
then
we're
going
to
assume
that
there
was
reliance,
that
there
was
causation,
and
the
causation
and
the
reliance
and
the
materiality
will
merge.
and
i
think
that
was
properly
made
in
that
case.
that
these
people
could
not
have
been
protected
any
other
where
--
way
when
there
were
thousands
of
them,
you
can't
put
them
on
the
stand.
this
is
an
entirely
different
case.
in
this
case,
there
were
12
petitioners,
every
one
of
them
took
the
stand
and
all
the
lawyer
had
to
do
to
mr.
reed
would
say,
"would
you
have
sold
your
stocks
if
you'd
been
given
this
information,"
and
he
could
have
said
yes
or
no.
everyone
of
them
could
have
been
asking
if
that
--
if
they
relied
or
if
they
didn't
rely
because
this
caused
them
to
show.
but
that
evidence
was
never
in
the
record,
never
put
in
the
record
perhaps
because
counsel
didn't
know
what
they
were
going
to
say
or
they're
going
to
say
the
trainer,
they
forgot
to
ask.
we
don't
know.
but
the
fact
is
that
it
could
easily
be
in
the
record.
i
don't
think
this
court
wants
to
take
the
position
for
posterity
that
when
you
can
determine
whether
there's
reliance
or
causation
without
any
doubt.
that
in
those
cases,
we
should
assume
it,
and
we
don't
have
to.
i
think
that
would
be
dangerous
jurisprudence.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
yes.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
it
started
as
a
class
action,
mr.
justice,
and
then
judge
reed
decided
it
was
not
a
class
action
on
the
ground
that
the
individual
problems
would
be
more
expensive
than
the
common
problems.
and
so
then
in
conference,
counsel
with
judge
christiansen,
it
was
decided
that
we
should
take
12
cases
and
judge
christiansen
who
tried
this
bellwether
cases,
we
should
try
those
and
then
all
of
the
information
that
was
adduced,
the
evidence
was
adduced
that
would
be
common
use
of
any
other
cases
could
be
used
in
the
other
cases
if
it'd
ever
be
tried.
so
we
go
ahead
with
these
12
having
tried
and
appeals
with
(inaudible)
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
right.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
right.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
there
are
some
common
issues.
that
is
true.
but
then
only
the
12
were
chosen,
this
way
six
were
chosen
by
the
plaintiff
and
six
were
chosen
by
the
defendant,
and
that's
the
way
the
12
--
12
were
chosen.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
yes.
[laughs]
apparently.
i
think
that
--
i
--
i
tried
out
the
zone.
now,
of
course,
what
we
--
we
relied
on
is
the
list
versus
the
fashion
park
case
and
that
--
where
it
says
there
needs
--
needs
to
be
reliance
and
they
just
describe
reliance
in
that
case.
in
a
case
of
a
representation,
the
court
and
the
fashion
--
list
versus
fashion
park
--
fashion
park,
second
circuit
says
the
proper
test
is
whether
the
plaintiff
would
have
been
influenced
to
act
differently
than
he
did
act
if
the
defendant
had
disclosed
the
--
the
undisclosed
fact.
now,
that's
a
case
of
a
nondisclosure.
in
a
case
of
a
disclosure,
a
or
false
representation,
the
court
said,
“insofar
as
this
is
pertinent
here,
the
test
of
reliance
and
to
whether
the
misrepresentation
is
a
substantial
factor
in
determining
the
course
of
the
conduct
which
results
in
the
recipient's
loss.
of
course,
this
was
a
case,
fashion
park,
where
there
was
an
individual
involved
which
you
can
put
on
the
stand
and
he
could
be
questioned
as
to
whether
he
relied
or
he
didn't
rely.
that's
a
case
again
where
he
sold
--
he
sold
his
stock
for
$18.50
a
share
and
the
corporation
shortly
later,
the
company
sold
all
the
other
stocks
for
$50,
and
he
sued
and
the
court
said
(inaudible)
that
you
--
the
nondisclosure
that
they
were
going
to
sell,
there's
no
evidence
that
they're
going
to
sell
that
--
that
that
had
any
effect
upon
your
sale,
you
may
have
done
it
anywhere.
i
will
close
by
just
--
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
in
this
case,
your
honor,
they've
decided
that
there
was
--
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
--
of
reliance.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
the
bank
and
as
far
as
the
two
individuals
are
concerned.
since
there
was
no
reliance,
there
was
no
liability,
but
they
said,
"we
will
send
it
back
for
action
to
be
taken
into
importance
of
this
opinion."
now,
if
the
court
wants
to
ask
me
what
i
think
that
means,
i'm
not
sure
i
can
give
an
accurate
answer
but
i
think
it
--
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
i
think
--
i
think
that
it
means
of
giving
opportunity
for
those
who
were
involved
in
the
sales
to
gale
and
haslem
to
prove
the
cases
and
to
prove
the
reliance.
i
don't
think
it
meats
of
these
12
can
go
through
it.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
right.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
in
the
ones
that
i
have
mentioned,
the
two
cases,
yes.
the
two
cases
have
--
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
they
didn't
--
well,
they
said
the
bank
would
be
responsible
for
it.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
they
did.
they
attributed
their
sale
to
--
to
the
bank
because
they
--
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
right.
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
yes.
the
--
they
set
--
what
--
what
they
thought
the
major
damage
would
be.
they
said
the
cases
to
be
considered
and
those
cases
were
mixed-blood
sold
to
gale
or
to
haslem
and
the
measure
of
damages
means
how
much
the
difference
between
what
they
sold
to
gale
and
how
much
gale
got
from
somebody
else.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
no.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
that's
right,
your
honor.
we're
--
we're
willing
to
accept
the
challenge
of
the
circuit
court
to
go
back
and
let
them
see
if
there
was
reliance.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
i
concede
in
the
one
case
that
i
mentioned,
your
honor.
the
purchase
from
--
from
mr.
gale
--
by
mr.
gale
from
mr.
reed
in
that
one
case
i
proceed
if
you
accept
the
fact
as
the
circuit
solve
them
and
i
will
do
that
for
this
purpose
--
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
--
in
the
one
case
only.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
if
he
is
going
to
--
he
knows
at
that
time
that
he's
going
to
sell
it
to
somebody
else
with
some
more
money.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
well,
i
would
say
no
and
the
circuit
didn't
say
--
say
that
that
would
be
a
violation.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
the
sec.
i
think
that
concern
better
if
i
understand
it
correctly.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
right.
you're
right.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
that's
right,
your
honor,
they
do
on
this
basis
that
there
was
fiduciary
relationship.
and
of
course,
i
attack
that
in
my
second
brief
and
reply
to
them.
that's
a
--
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
not
at
all.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
no.
thank
you.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
mr.
justice
douglas
and
if
the
court
please.
i
represent
the
respondent,
the
bank
and
the
two
individuals
who
are
employed
by
the
bank,
gale
and
haslem.of
course,
it
is
our
desire
that
this
court
sustained
the
decision
of
the
united
states
circuit
court
of
appeals.
one
difficulty
in
this
case
in
getting
a
(inaudible)
that
counsel
for
the
plaintiff
and
now
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
in
connection
with
--
with
its
brief
has
constructed
hypothetical
facts
that
do
not
relate
to
the
particular
individuals,
who
were
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
there
is
a
suggestion,
was
made
here
today
seems
to
be
that
somehow
we
(inaudible)
offered
sale
with
some
kind
of
fraudulent
(inaudible)
which
is
(inaudible)
had
this
--
this
stock
or
sale
by
all
of
the
mixed-blood.
and
the
question,
of
course,
was
whether
or
not,
gale
and
haslem
are
employees
violated
10b-5.
and
the
only
way
whether
that
can
be
ascertained
and
whether
or
not
that
affected,
whether
it
caused
damage
to
any
of
these
12
petitioners
is
to
be
found
in
the
fact
and
the
law
related
to
those
12
individuals
which
is
not
to
be
found
out
here
in
abstract
(inaudible)
plaintiffs'
counsel
or
petitioners'
counsel
have
insistently
and
repeatedly
tailored
a
--
a
code
of
many
odious
colors
which
has
never
been
worn
by
and
which
does
not
fit
any
of
the
particular
petitioners
in
this
lawsuit.
so
i
can
only
appeal
to
the
court
in
deciding
this
case
has
been
only
be
determined
whether
or
not
these
12
individuals
has
--
have
been
injured
or
any
of
them
have
been
caused
damage
because
of
the
violation
can
be
divided
by
examining
the
facts
and
the
law
with
respect
to
each
one
of
those
individuals.
now,
let's
go
to
the
act
which
have
been
considered
--
which
may
have
been
considered
violative
of
10b-5.
today,
with
respect
to
the
wrongful
acts
of
the
facts
or
the
corporate
--
corporate
itself,
my
friend
and
colleague
mr.
nielson
has
said
that
they
retained
these
stock
(inaudible)
whether
its
(inaudible)
or
the
indians
couldn't
read,
the
mixed-bloods
couldn't
read
this
notation
on
it
that
they
--
that
have
been
(inaudible)
well,
of
course,
that
was
done
by
the
bank
at
the
request
of
the
ute
distribution
corporation
at
the
request
of
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs,
the
agreement
of
all
three
believing
that
would
be
helpful
to
the
indians
so
they
wouldn't
loose
those
shares
of
stocks.
that
is
hardly
thought
in
having
this
part
of
its
allusion
of
fraud
which
(inaudible)
as
far
as
the
market
making
is
concerned,
which
has
been
mentioned,
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
specifically
said
there
was
no
evidence
with
the
bank,
did
anything
about
making
markets.
and
on
these
general
matters
where
it
is
of
no
help
to
this
court
and
mr.
nielson,
and
i
just
stand
up
here
and
he
said
he
did
and
i
say
he
didn't.
all
he
and
i
can
do
is
refer
you
to
the
record
and
that
is
what
i
do,
i
just
categorically
deny
that
--
that
there
--
all
these
actions
by
the
government
which
created
an
atmosphere
of
fraud.
well,
let's
talk
about
specific
things
that
even
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
said
they're
--
they
did
post
a
possibility
of
violation
of
10b-5
in
connection
of
the
action
with
a
couple
of
these
--
of
these
petitioners.
and
i
think
we
ought
to
examine
those.
and
i'm
willing
to
examine
those
words
that
where
the
circuit
court
said
"maybe
you
did,
your
man
did
violate
section
10b-5.
let's
take
mr.
gale,
it
should
be
kept
in
mind
first
of
all
that
there'd
be
12
petitioners.
mr.
gale
bought
stocks
in
only
two.
he
bought
five
shares
from
mr.
reed,
five
shares
from
mrs.
wopsock
and
that's
all
he
bought.
with
respect
to
the
other
(inaudible)
he
didn't
buy
any
shares
of
the.
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
encouraging
the
sale
with
participation
in
the
sale
of
getting
some
benefits
in
the
sale,
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
them
except
in
connection
with
some
of
them,
he
signed
and
notarized
an
affidavit
or
he's
--
he
(inaudible)
you
see
the
signature
on
top
of.
and
that's
all
he
had
to
do
with
them.
some
of
them,
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
them
or
didn't
even
know
about
it.
in
regard
to
mr.
haslem
on
the
other
hand,
he
bought
some
only
two
of
them.
one
of
them
was
again
mr.
reed,
he
bought
his
other
five
shares
from
--
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
mr.
glen
reed.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
that's
principle.
yes.
of
course
now,
these
were
bought
to
the
banks
and
sold
with
the
bank,
then
there's
nothing
on.
he
bought
--
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
well,
the
used
car
dealers
got
in
the
picture
on
their
own.
and
there
were
many
car
dealers
in
on
the
picture.
of
these
approximately
1500
shares
of
stocks
sold
and
it
very
existed
during
in
54
and
55
(inaudible)
that
we're
--
we're
dealing
with
the
1500
shares
of
stock
sold.
there
were
32
different
white
men
who
--
who
purchased
stocks.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
gale
and
haslem
bought
115
shares
put
them
together.
only
8.3%
of
all
those
who
were
bought
sold.
what's
in
this
--
the
used
car
dealers.
now,
the
end
of
this
doesn't
show
whether
the
car
dealers
themselves
committed
fraud
on
these
people.
they
--
they
may
have
done.
the
record
doesn't
show
that
these
used
car
dealers
paid
the
money
and
--
and
ran,
got
out
of
the
case,
settled
out
of
the
case.
so
we
cannot
say
that
it
may
well
be
from
these
used
car
people
(inaudible)
some
of
this
people
or
some
of
their
stock
and
gave
them
less
desirable
consideration.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
no.
there
were
32
non-indian
buyers
that
i
know
of.
there
were
113
shares
of
stock
bought
by
gale
and
haslem.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
out
of
1300
shares
that
were
sold
by
the
mixed-bloods.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
right.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
that's
right.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
yes.
i
think
the
record
shows
that
were
about
seven
of
them
who
were
outside
of
utah.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
one
from
illinois,
one
from
new
orleans,
one
from
arizona,
several
from
colorado.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
(inaudible)
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
i
don't
know.
they
may
have
known
from
relatives,
you
see
it
wasn't
the
bank
who
advertised
it.
i
don't
know
how
these
people
found
out.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
i
know
that
some
of
them
came
in
and
they
contacted
the
bank
and
said
the
bank
(inaudible)
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
yes.
and
--
and
we
submit
that
that
has
--
has
got
them
involved
and
the
record
will
not
support
it
and
the
circuit
said
that
considerably
at
(inaudible)
the
record
does
not
support
contention
of
the
fact
as
a
market
method.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
i
don't
know
how
the
man
in
illinois
knew
about
it.
it's
maybe
in
the
record,
your
honor
but
i
don't
know.
now,
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
said
that
(inaudible)
in
connection
with
the
sale,
purchase
of
this
five
shares
of
stock
with
mr.
reed.
i'm
asking
it
because
i
think
this
is
my
--
my
most
dangerous
case,
a
violation
of
case.
that
when
he
bought
fives
shares
in
january,
the
circuit
court
is
to
made
both
on
this
representation
and
perhaps
a
nondisclosure.
he
bought
the
shares
for
$350
and
he
sold
them
sometime
later
to
another
white
man
one
for
$530
who
spend
share.
now,
the
circuit
says,
and
i
certainly
want
(inaudible)
said,
"there
is
in
effect
a
misrepresentation
here
because
he
indicated
that
this
man,
reed,
has
certainly
applied
the
$350
worth
of
market."
the
value
of
the
stock
at
that
time
when
it
wasn't
because
it's
(inaudible)
sell
up
for
$530
and
maybe
guilty
of
nondisclosure
because
he
did
not
reveal
from
mr.
reed
that
he
was
going
to
sell
--
that
he
is
going
to
sell
it
later
for
$530.
now,
this
is
no
worst
case,
then
the
circuit
said,
"however,
there
is
no
evidence
even
if
this
is
a
misrepresentation
of
a
nondisclosure
which
would
be
in
violation
of
10b-5.
there's
no
evidence
that
there
was
reliance
here,
that
this
was
the
cause
of
misrepresentation
or
this
non-disclosure
was
the
cause
of
the
sale."
now,
that
--
of
the
one
--
was
that
--
accept
i
want
to
put
haslem
in
--
in
focus
hereto
because
there
is
something
that
he
did,
the
circuit
said
(inaudible)
was
in
a
violation.
they
said
that
if
haslem
indicated
when
he
purchased
some
stock,
but
that
was
the
market
price,
he
made
a
misrepresentation.
however,
with
haslem,
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
he
ever
sold
it
to
anybody
else
at
any
profit.
so
they
cannot
be
found
to
be
a
violation
of
10b-5
as
far
as
she
is
concerned.
then
i
was
going
back
to
mr.
gale.
the
question
we
get
down
to
the
real
question
in
place
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
and
that
is
the
subject
to
go
on.
now,
i
think
we
all
get
down
(inaudible)
is
the
real
bonus
concession
in
this
matter.
first,
of
course,
i
wanted
to
say
about
reliance.
is
reliance
to
be
--
to
be
assumed
if
the
representation
or
the
nondisclosure
is
material?
now,
the
reason
about,
i
believe,
because
of
the
case
mills
versus
auto-lite,
this
is
a
case
in
which
--
decided
by
this
court
last
year
and
that
the
case
which
reserved
the
tension
on
as
such.
it
is
a
case
in
which
--
which
i
believe
is
right
and
with
which
i
do
not
coil
it
up.
and
the
satisfaction
is
entirely
different
in
that
case
and
this
one.
and
the
other
like
case
you
will
recall
is
the
matter
of
miner
stockholder
suing
a
class
to
set
aside
a
merger
on
the
grounds
that
a
statement
and
a
proxy
--
proxy
statement
was
--
was
hailed
to
disclose
that
those
of
the
selling
--
of
the
merging
corporation,
the
directors
in
the
merging
corporation
sent
out
proxy
were
completely
controlled
by
the
court
relation
into
which
it
was
to
be
merged.
and
so
the
lower
court
--
well,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
were
thousands,
according
to
justice
harlan's
opinion,
there
were
thousands
of
stockholders
involved
and
these
are
minority
stockholders.
and
the
problem
was
in
the
trial
and
in
the
circuit
court,
how
we're
going
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
relied
on
the
nondisclosure
that
they
were
influenced
by
the
nondisclosure
in
the
proper
statement.
whether
or
not
they
would
have
voted
otherwise
had
this
fact
been
included
in
that
circuit.
and
the
circuit
court
and
the
trial
came
up
with
rather
fictitious
formula
saying,
"well,
this
is
the
tough
thing
to
do
because
there
are
thousands
and
they
came
in
inquiring
for
just
relying
to
each
one
causation
with
each
one,
we
--
so
we'll
adopt
its
formula.
if
it
appears
from
the
evidence
that
the
merger
was
a
good
move,
then
we
can
assume
that
if
they
had
known
all
of
the
facts,
they
would
have
bought
it.
well,
this
court,
and
i
think
quite
properly
said
that
doesn't
improve
anything
and
we're
not
going
to
accept
that
formula.
and
this
court
said
--
and
this,
i
think,
as
justice
harlan
was
done
exactly
quoting
the
circuit
court.
he
said
that
reliance
of
thousands
can
scarcely
--
can
scarcely
be
inquired
inquiry.
so
this
court
decided
that
a
case
like
that
where
the
nondisclosure
was
something
that
everybody
knew
and
knew
what
it
was,
where
it
was,
certainly
material.
or
the
court
said,
justice
harlan
said
had
a
(inaudible)
it
caused
someone
to
vote
one
way
or
another,
then
we're
going
to
assume
that
there
was
reliance,
that
there
was
causation,
and
the
causation
and
the
reliance
and
the
materiality
will
merge.
and
i
think
that
was
properly
made
in
that
case.
that
these
people
could
not
have
been
protected
any
other
where
--
way
when
there
were
thousands
of
them,
you
can't
put
them
on
the
stand.
this
is
an
entirely
different
case.
in
this
case,
there
were
12
petitioners,
every
one
of
them
took
the
stand
and
all
the
lawyer
had
to
do
to
mr.
reed
would
say,
"would
you
have
sold
your
stocks
if
you'd
been
given
this
information,"
and
he
could
have
said
yes
or
no.
everyone
of
them
could
have
been
asking
if
that
--
if
they
relied
or
if
they
didn't
rely
because
this
caused
them
to
show.
but
that
evidence
was
never
in
the
record,
never
put
in
the
record
perhaps
because
counsel
didn't
know
what
they
were
going
to
say
or
they're
going
to
say
the
trainer,
they
forgot
to
ask.
we
don't
know.
but
the
fact
is
that
it
could
easily
be
in
the
record.
i
don't
think
this
court
wants
to
take
the
position
for
posterity
that
when
you
can
determine
whether
there's
reliance
or
causation
without
any
doubt.
that
in
those
cases,
we
should
assume
it,
and
we
don't
have
to.
i
think
that
would
be
dangerous
jurisprudence.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
yes.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
it
started
as
a
class
action,
mr.
justice,
and
then
judge
reed
decided
it
was
not
a
class
action
on
the
ground
that
the
individual
problems
would
be
more
expensive
than
the
common
problems.
and
so
then
in
conference,
counsel
with
judge
christiansen,
it
was
decided
that
we
should
take
12
cases
and
judge
christiansen
who
tried
this
bellwether
cases,
we
should
try
those
and
then
all
of
the
information
that
was
adduced,
the
evidence
was
adduced
that
would
be
common
use
of
any
other
cases
could
be
used
in
the
other
cases
if
it'd
ever
be
tried.
so
we
go
ahead
with
these
12
having
tried
and
appeals
with
(inaudible)
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
right.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
right.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
there
are
some
common
issues.
that
is
true.
but
then
only
the
12
were
chosen,
this
way
six
were
chosen
by
the
plaintiff
and
six
were
chosen
by
the
defendant,
and
that's
the
way
the
12
--
12
were
chosen.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
yes.
[laughs]
apparently.
i
think
that
--
i
--
i
tried
out
the
zone.
now,
of
course,
what
we
--
we
relied
on
is
the
list
versus
the
fashion
park
case
and
that
--
where
it
says
there
needs
--
needs
to
be
reliance
and
they
just
describe
reliance
in
that
case.
in
a
case
of
a
representation,
the
court
and
the
fashion
--
list
versus
fashion
park
--
fashion
park,
second
circuit
says
the
proper
test
is
whether
the
plaintiff
would
have
been
influenced
to
act
differently
than
he
did
act
if
the
defendant
had
disclosed
the
--
the
undisclosed
fact.
now,
that's
a
case
of
a
nondisclosure.
in
a
case
of
a
disclosure,
a
or
false
representation,
the
court
said,
“insofar
as
this
is
pertinent
here,
the
test
of
reliance
and
to
whether
the
misrepresentation
is
a
substantial
factor
in
determining
the
course
of
the
conduct
which
results
in
the
recipient's
loss.
of
course,
this
was
a
case,
fashion
park,
where
there
was
an
individual
involved
which
you
can
put
on
the
stand
and
he
could
be
questioned
as
to
whether
he
relied
or
he
didn't
rely.
that's
a
case
again
where
he
sold
--
he
sold
his
stock
for
$18.50
a
share
and
the
corporation
shortly
later,
the
company
sold
all
the
other
stocks
for
$50,
and
he
sued
and
the
court
said
(inaudible)
that
you
--
the
nondisclosure
that
they
were
going
to
sell,
there's
no
evidence
that
they're
going
to
sell
that
--
that
that
had
any
effect
upon
your
sale,
you
may
have
done
it
anywhere.
i
will
close
by
just
--
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
in
this
case,
your
honor,
they've
decided
that
there
was
--
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
--
of
reliance.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
the
bank
and
as
far
as
the
two
individuals
are
concerned.
since
there
was
no
reliance,
there
was
no
liability,
but
they
said,
"we
will
send
it
back
for
action
to
be
taken
into
importance
of
this
opinion."
now,
if
the
court
wants
to
ask
me
what
i
think
that
means,
i'm
not
sure
i
can
give
an
accurate
answer
but
i
think
it
--
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
i
think
--
i
think
that
it
means
of
giving
opportunity
for
those
who
were
involved
in
the
sales
to
gale
and
haslem
to
prove
the
cases
and
to
prove
the
reliance.
i
don't
think
it
meats
of
these
12
can
go
through
it.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
right.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
in
the
ones
that
i
have
mentioned,
the
two
cases,
yes.
the
two
cases
have
--
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
they
didn't
--
well,
they
said
the
bank
would
be
responsible
for
it.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
they
did.
they
attributed
their
sale
to
--
to
the
bank
because
they
--
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
right.
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
yes.
the
--
they
set
--
what
--
what
they
thought
the
major
damage
would
be.
they
said
the
cases
to
be
considered
and
those
cases
were
mixed-blood
sold
to
gale
or
to
haslem
and
the
measure
of
damages
means
how
much
the
difference
between
what
they
sold
to
gale
and
how
much
gale
got
from
somebody
else.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
no.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
that's
right,
your
honor.
we're
--
we're
willing
to
accept
the
challenge
of
the
circuit
court
to
go
back
and
let
them
see
if
there
was
reliance.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
i
concede
in
the
one
case
that
i
mentioned,
your
honor.
the
purchase
from
--
from
mr.
gale
--
by
mr.
gale
from
mr.
reed
in
that
one
case
i
proceed
if
you
accept
the
fact
as
the
circuit
solve
them
and
i
will
do
that
for
this
purpose
--
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
--
in
the
one
case
only.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
if
he
is
going
to
--
he
knows
at
that
time
that
he's
going
to
sell
it
to
somebody
else
with
some
more
money.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
well,
i
would
say
no
and
the
circuit
didn't
say
--
say
that
that
would
be
a
violation.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
the
sec.
i
think
that
concern
better
if
i
understand
it
correctly.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
right.
you're
right.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
that's
right,
your
honor,
they
do
on
this
basis
that
there
was
fiduciary
relationship.
and
of
course,
i
attack
that
in
my
second
brief
and
reply
to
them.
that's
a
--
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
not
at
all.
mr.
marvin
j.
bertoch
no.
thank
you.
