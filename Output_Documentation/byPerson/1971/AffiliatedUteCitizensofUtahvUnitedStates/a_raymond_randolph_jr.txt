mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
mr.
justice
douglas,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
people
thought
a
--
case
of
--
raise
quite
different
issues
with
respect
to
the
library
of
united
states.
the
issue
in
the
affiliated
ute
case
is
whether
the
district
court
properly
dismissed
the
action
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
finding
that
it
was
an
unpresented
pursuit
against
the
united
states.
the
issue
in
the
reyos
case
from
the
other
hand
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
properly
found
that
the
united
states
had
no
duty
to
prevent
terminated
mixed-blood
indians
from
selling
their
shares
at
less
than
fair
market
value.
although
the
case
has
raised
quite
different
issue
so
--
as
counsel
for
the
petitioner
had
said,
those
relate
to
the
ute
partition
act
of
1954.
and
i
think
that
that
fills
that
act
in
a
working
of
that
act
is
necessary
for
an
understanding
of
the
claims
in
these
cases.
in
1954,
the
ute
indian
tribe
of
the
uintah
and
ouray
reservation
in
utah
consisted
of
approximately
1800
members.
there
were
two
distinct
groups,
the
--
the
full-blood
indians
and
the
mixed-blood
indians.
the
mixed-blood
ute
indians
consisted
of
approximately
one
quarter
of
the
1803
--
1800
members
of
the
tribe.
for
a
number
of
years,
preceding
1954,
there
had
been
considerable
fixing
among
the
mixed-bloods
and
full-blood
indians.
the
reason
for
this
is
quite
understandable.
many
of
the
mixed-bloods
do
not
live
on
the
reservation.
many
of
the
mixed-bloods
were
already
integrated
within
the
non-indian
society
which
standard
of
living
was
virtually
indistinguishable
from
the
non-indian
society
in
which
they
live
and
their
educational
status
was
the
same.
the
crutching
between
these
two
groups
reached
its
peak
in
1950
and
1951
when
this
group
of
indians
went
on
ouray
reservation
became
entitled
to
60%
of
the
$31
million
budget
against
the
united
states.
the
full-blood
indians
also
quite
understandably
wished
to
increase
money
to
--
to
improve
their
reservation
to
build
schools
and
hospitals.
however,
many
of
the
mixed-bloods
wished
to
have
the
money
in
cash
and
had
no
interest
from
spending
it
on
a
reservation
where,
of
course,
they
never
lived
and
had
not
lived.
the
groups
met
in
tribal
council
over
a
period
of
approximately
one
year
to
work
up
these
differences.
the
ute
partition
act
of
1954
was
the
result
of
their
compromise
that
represent
more
than
anything
else
a
treaty
of
peace
between
these
two
groups
because
the
act
itself
is
drafted
and
hammered
out
by
the
indians
and
then
introduced
at
their
request
in
congress.
and
while
the
act
was
being
considered
by
congress,
both
representatives
of
the
mixed-blood
and
full-blood
group
went
to
washington
and
supported,
fully
supported
the
bill
and
said
that
if
we
submitted
to
a
vote
of
their
respective
membership
and
approve
overwhelmingly.
the
three
main
features
of
the
ute
partition
act,
one
is
the
division
of
the
tribal
assets
that
of
course
affected,
did
not
affect
the
individual
assets
held
by
the
individual
membership
tribe,
only
the
tribal
assets.
the
second
feature
is
the
combination
of
the
--
of
the
mixed-blood
indians
who
were
defined
as
having
--
as
having
not
more
than
one-half
ute
indian
blood.
the
third
feature
is
that
the
full-blood
with
--
the
trustee
relationship
between
the
united
states
and
the
full-blood
would
remain.
the
way
the
act
was
administered
and
the
way
this
partition
for
place
of
course
is
quite
complicated.
one
thing
that
can
be
said
about
it
is
that
we've
done
by
the
group
themselves
for
the
act
provided
that
the
group
was,
first
of
all,
first,
the
mixed-blood
and
full-blood
groups
were
be
together
and
divide
its
plan
for
--
for
dividing
their
efforts
between
them
one
on
the
judgement
of
the
relative
numbers
in
the
group.
this
turned
out
to
be
when
the
final
rolls
were
published
27%
mixed-blood
and
73%
full-blood.
the
next
--
the
next
step
in
the
process
was
to
have
the
mixed-blood
meet
by
themselves
and
determine
the
plans
of
distributing
these
assets.
the
plan
of
distribution
and
the
final
provision
were
contained
in
the
record
from
this
case.
one
of
the
difficulties,
of
course,
the
group
ran
into
with
how
to
distribute
assets
that
were
not
equally,
equitably
divided,
such
as
oil,
gas
and
mineral
rights.
when
the
--
when
the
ute
indians
were
considering
drafting
this
act,
the
court
realized
that
it
would
be
inequitable
to
split
up
just
solely
on
the
basis
of
geographical
consideration
the
mineral
rights.
approximately,
the
tribe
owns
at
that
time
approximately
one
million
acres
of
mineral
rights
which
is
approximately
the
size
of
delaware.
so
what
they
did
and
what
they
decided
to
do
is
to
retain
the
mineral
rights,
the
oil,
gas
and
mineral
rights
at
tribal
property
and
to
split
up
only
one
thing
or
only
two
things,
the
proceeds
from
the
mineral
rights
and
--
and
the
management.
the
management
was
to
be
joint.
the
proceeds
will
be
distributed
on
a
27%
and
73%
basis.
as
the
plans
worked
out
across
the
--
the
--
both
groups
via
its
representatives
who
negotiated
the
plans
and
work
them
out
for
them,
deprive
at
its
own
tribal
council,
and
that
was
no
problem.
however,
the
mixed-blood,
first
of
all,
adopted
a
constitution
forming
an
organization
known
as
affiliated
ute
citizens.
in
that
--
in
the
constitution
of
the
affiliated
ute
citizens
which
provided
the
delegating
authority
irrevocably
the
corporation
in
order
to
manage
certain
of
the
assets
of
the
mixed-blood
group.
three
corporations
were
formed,
the
rock
creek
cattle
company,
the
antelope-sheep
range
company
which
felt
with
graving
lands,
and
the
other,
ute
distribution
corporation,
which
is
involved
in
this
case.
the
corporation
was
formed
in
1958.
it
is
of
ten
shares
of
stock
to
each
individual
mixed-blood
indians
and
the
mixed-blood
hurdled
490
at
that
time.
this
range
is
appositive
of
the
case.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
they
specifically
authorize,
mr.
justice
white.
the
resolution
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes.
they
adopted
a
resolution.
they're
clear
after
that
way.
the
first
thing
that
i
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
it
was
a
general
membership
meeting
under
the
quorum
under
their
constitution.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
how
many
people
require
the
quorum,
mr.
justice
brennan?
30.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
30.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
i
don't
know.
it's
not
in
the
record.
the
issue
in
the
affiliated
--
i
was
(inaudible)
about
the
affiliated
ute
citizens
(inaudible)
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
there
were
two
aspects.
there's
an
(inaudible)
the
first
thing
was
when
they
--
when
they
divide
the
plan
of
distribution.
the
plan
of
distribution
had,
and
i
believe
it's
section
10,
was
similarly
appendix
to
the
amicus
brief
by
the
tribe
considered
in
full.
they
contemplated
in
forming
a
corporation.
that's
the
plan
to
handle
the
--
the
mineral
rights.
that
plan
was
unanimously
adopted
by
the
membership
or
at
least
so
it's
reported
in
a
--
in
a
--
or
in
a
resolution
by
affiliated
ute
citizens.
the
next
step
of
the
process
was
the
actual
delegation
of
the
authority
according
to
the
constitution
and
that
was
the
--
that
was
the
second
resolution
i
was
talking
to
a
few
minutes
ago
before
i
started
a
moment
ago.
i
said
our
--
first
of
the
issue
in
the
affiliated
ute
case
and
then
discussed
to
use
it
in
reyos.
the
affiliated
ute
case,
it
was
brought
--
the
suit
was
brought
by
this
unincorporated
association
purporting
to
represent
all
accommodated
mixed-blood
indians.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
they
were
supervised
throughout
until
1961
when
termination
took
place.
yes,
of
course,
there
was
constant
consultation.
and
i
might
add
there
--
there
was
a
contract
with
university
of
utah
which
provided
for
educational
service,
training
and
relocation
and
another
factor.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes.
the
plan
was
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
the
plan
was
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
--
worked
out.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
or
supervise,
yes.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
well,
it's
rather
an
informal
raise
--
what
is
the
tribe
--
was
the
mixed-blood
in
terms
of
their
own
plans
of
distribution.
it
was
a
full-blood
in
this
case
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes.
the
act
provided
for
the
plan
of
distribution
and
the
plan
of
division
of
the
tribal
assets,
yes.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
oh,
yes.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
677e
of
the
act
provided
specifically
for
this.
in
the
affiliated
ute
citizens
case
simply
brought
against
the
united
states
and
may
have
informed.
and
in
the
complaint,
the
claim
was
that
the
individual
members
of
this
organization
were
entitled
to
“an
individual
undivided
pro
rata
share
of
27%
of
approximately
1,200,000
acres
of
mineral
lands
subject
only
to
the
right
of
the
association
to
manage
that
property
jointly
to
the
tribal
business
council".
jurisdiction
was
invoked
primarily
under
25
u.s.c.
345.
the
district
court
dismissed
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
and
prepared
the
date
of
claim
upon
which
the
relief
would
be
granted.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
on
the
basis
that
this
was
an
(inaudible)
against
the
united
states
and
this
section
345
did
not
comply
the
necessary
percent
to
be
sued.
unlike
many
recent
cases
in
this
court
where
the
question
was
whether
a
suit
against
an
officer
of
the
united
states
was
really
a
suit
against
the
united
states,
this
--
this
case,
there's
no
such
question.
it
brought
directly
against
the
united
states
and
may
have
informed.
and
it's
long
been
held
in
this
court
that
a
suit
relating
to
government
property
against
the
united
states
cannot
be
brought
without
the
united
states'
consent.
the
principle
applies
equally
to
indian
land
held
in
cross
by
the
united
states
and
applies
also
when
the
suit
is
brought
by
a
group
of
indians
claiming
the
beneficial
interest
in
that
land.
in
this
case,
there's
no
dispute
whatsoever
that
the
united
states
holds
--
holds
title
in
trust
to
the
mineral
assets
on
the
reservation.
therefore,
plaintiff
action
in
order
to
go
forward
has
to
be
based
on
some
specific
statute,
federal
statute,
authorizing
this
kind
of
suit.
they've
invoked
section
25
u.s.c.
345.
that
section
which
is
setout
on
pages
90
to
91
of
our
brief
provides
that
any
person
who
are
wholer
in
blood
--
wholer
in
part
of
indian
blood
or
decent,
he
were
entitled
to
an
allotment
of
land
under
an
act
of
congress
were
claimed
to
be
so
entitled
or
under
any
allotment
act
or
any
under
grant
made
by
congress
or
the
claims
beyond
were
lawfully
denied
or
exclude
from
any
allotment
or
any
parcel
of
land
and
bring
action
in
the
district
court
to
determine,
and
the
jurisdictional
section
is
after
the
semicolon.
where
the
district
court
may
determine
any
action,
pursuit
or
proceeding
involving
the
right
of
any
person
pursuing
allotment
of
land,
we
think
this
case
does
not
fall
within
that
statute.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
they
asked
for
--
i'm
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes
i'm
not
exactly
clear
how
this
could
be
done
but
i
quote,
“they
kind
to
be
entitled
to
individual
undivided
pro
rata
share
of
27%
of
approximately
1,200,000
acres
of
minerals."
the
merit
to
that
question
has
never
been
reached.
allotment
is
a
term
of
art
in
indian
law.
and
the
latter
half
of
the
19th
century,
it
was
the
policy
of
united
states,
in
particular,
stressing
the
general
allotment
act
of
1887,
the
shift,
the
right
of
indian
in
real
property
consistently
participation
in
tribal
property
the
right
of
individual
ownership
in
particular
tracks.
the
land
or
the
mineral
estate
involved
in
this
case
is
a
very
(inaudible)
within
the
allotment
of
land
because
it's
never
been
divided.
it's
tribal
property.
there's
no
question
about
that.
there's
no
individual
ownership
of
this
land
involved.
in
the
usual
allotment
situation,
a
reservation
would
be
surveyed,
a
track
of
a
certain
number
of
acres
set
aside,
the
indian
would
make
a
selection
and
the
secretary
of
interior
would
issue
a
patent.
section
345
relates
only
to
those
kinds
of
situation.
you
think
this
is
not
a
suit
regarding
an
allotment
of
land
by
any
stretch
of
imagination.
for
now
to
the
reyos
case.
in
reyos,
there
were
12
designated
in
this
plaintiffs
the
claim
that
during
1963,
1964
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes.
we
pointed
that
out
in
our
brief,
mr.
justice
douglas.
it
was
stipulated,
i
might
point
out,
in
the
reyos
case
that
the
corporation
was
a
validly
formed
corporation
and
the
district
court
so
found.
the
whole
point
in
the
reyos
case
was
that
the
stock
has
substantial
value.
in
the
affiliated
ute
case
on
the
other
hand,
the
claim
--
the
corporation
was
invalid
and
that
it
should
never
been
given
the
assets
to
manage
to
begin
with.
we
think
there
are
basically
inconsistent.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
that's
right.
in
reyos,
the
12
designated
mixed-blood
plaintiffs
sold
their
stock
during
1963,
1964
and
1965.
it
sued
the
united
states
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
and
their
claim
was
that
the
government
was
negligent
by
selling
--
to
prevent
them
from
selling
their
own
shares
for
less
than
fair
market
value.
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
held
that
the
trust
relationship
between
the
government
and
each
individual
mixed-blood
terminated
in
1961
before
any
of
the
sales
took
place
and
that
the
government
therefore
had
no
duty
to
supervise
mixed-blood
sellers
disposing
of
their
stocks.
they
pointed
out
under
the
act
that
oil,
gas
and
minerals
were
owned
by
the
tribe
and
were
not
divided.
but
the
proceeds
were
and
the
management
rights
were
divided.the
mixed-blood
formed
udc
in
1958
may
issue
stock.
under
677d
of
the
act,
the
secretary
of
interior
on
august
27th,
1961,
and
this
is
on
page
40
of
our
brief,
issued
a
termination
proclamation
stating,
“with
respect
to
each
and
every
individual
mixed-blood,
federal
restriction
from
the
property
have
been
removed.
the
federal
trust
relationship
of
such
individual
is
terminated.
that
such
individual
shall
not
be
entitled
to
any
of
the
services
performed
for
indians
because
of
his
status
as
an
indian
and
all
statutes
of
the
united
states
which
affecting
the
--
the
course
of
their
status
of
indians
shall
no
longer
be
applicable."
we
think
that
after
this
period,
secretary
of
interior
had
no
duty
to
say
perhaps
indeed
no
right
to
say
to
an
indian,
“you
can't
sell
your
stock
for
that
amount”
or
“i'll
only
let
you
sell
your
stock
if
you
really
need
the
money
at
this
time”
or
even
had
he
might
have
said
that
these
were
restricted
indian
property,
“you
can
only
sell
your
stock
if
you
spend
the
money
in
the
proceed
for
--
for
food
and
clothing
for
you
and
--
and
your
family”.
we
think
that
after
1961,
he
not
only
had
no
duty
to
do
that,
i
think
the
mixed-blood
would
be
--
would
have
been
infuriated
if
he
had
tried
to
do
that.
the
plaintiff
had
claimed
however
that
there's
--
right
there
was
a
right
of
first
refusal
and
that
they
claimed
this
right
of
first
refusal
somehow
created
the
duty
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
specifically
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
to
supervise
their
shares
even
after
1961.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
it's
not
entirely
clear,
mr.
justice
brennan.
we
think
the
right
of
first
refusal
stems
from
article
viii
of
the
articles
of
incorporation
of
ute
distribution
corporation
which
provides
that
any
mixed-blood
who
sell
their
shares
before
august
27th,
1964
must
first
offer
them
to
members
of
the
tribe.
there's
no
acceptance
of
that
offer.
he
may
then
sell
the
same
or
greater
amount
under
the
same
terms
and
conditions
offered
for
the
members.
the
secretary
of
interior
was
--
was
required
under
the
articles
of
incorporation
certified
of
one
thing,
that
he
offered
to
members
of
the
tribe
was
made
in
accordance
with
the
law
and
regulations
of
the
secretary
of
interior.
that
is
the
original
offer
which,
if
not
accepted,
would
allow
the
mixed-blood
to
sell
to
whom
he
may
please.
this
is
contained
on
page
6
of
the
exhibit
appendix.
also,
the
regulation
finally,
i
--
i
may
point
out,
that
under
the
act,
under
677n
of
the
act
was
a
similar
right
of
first
refusal
for
land.
and
so
when
the
secretary
promulgated
regulations
dealing
with
the
right
of
first
refusal
for
land,
the
very
last
clause
in
those
regulations
stated
that
as
far
as
practicable,
these
regulations
should
apply
to
sales
of
stocks
in
the
corporations
formed
by
the
mixed-blood.
the
bank
operated
its
transfer
agent
for
the
stock
and
the
ute
distribution
corporation
and
the
bank
worked
out
a
procedure
in
september
of
1963.
i
might
point
out
at
this
point
that
there
were
no
sales
of
stock
until
the
late
summer
of
1963.
in
the
time
of
corporation
was
forming
until
december
of
1963,
there
were
no
sales
of
stocks,
the
first
sale
took
place,
i
think,
approximately
august
of
1963.
the
bank
work
out
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes,
it
should
be.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes.
please,
please.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
i'm
very
sorry
about
that.
in
any
event,
the
--
the
bank
operated
its
transfer
agent
of
stock.
and
they
worked
out
a
procedure
with
the
ute
distribution
corporation
whereby,
and
this
is
contained
on
page
29
and
31
--
29
and
31
of
the
exhibit
appendix,
whereby
after
the
offer
had
been
made
and
not
taken
up
by
a
member
of
the
tribe
to
seller,
when
he
completed
the
sale
would
furnished
an
affidavit
and
a
stock
power
to
the
--
including
the
superintendent
of
reservation.
and
then
the
superintendent
of
reservation
would
issue
the
certificate
stating
that
the
offer,
the
original
offer
had
been
properly
made
to
the
bank,
he
would
then
transfer
the
stock
to
the
buyer.
apparently,
the
main
thing
according
to
petitions
of
the
superintendent
did
wrong
here
was
that
he
failed
to
investigate
whether
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
were
telling
the
truth
on
their
affidavit.
the
superintendent
apparently
thought
that
the
regulations
in
the
ute
distribution
articles
of
incorporation
required
only
to
certify
that
the
original
offer
was
proper.
and
i
think
maybe
that
was
too
strict
in
interpretation
of
the
regulation.
however,
the
one
thing
which
seemed
perfectly
clear
is
that
the
right
of
first
refusal
did
not
create
any
duty
for
the
people
that
were
selling
the
stock.
this
apparently
had
not
called
it's
true
from
their
affidavit
because
the
right
of
first
refusal
of
anything
was
for
the
benefit
of
the
people
who
(inaudible).
it's
for
the
benefit
of
the
people
who
remained
in
--
remained
in
the
tribe
and
also
for
the
mixed-blood
so
they
could
retain
control
of
their
corporation.
the
seller
obviously
cannot
accept
its
own
offer
and
we
think
therefore
that
this
created
no
duty
to
the
people
who
bring
this
suit,
the
mixed-blood
seller
who
claimed
there
had
been
--
have
sold
for
less
than
fair
market
value.
we
don't
think
they're
entirely
without
protection
however.
i
think
--
and
point
3
--
part
3
of
our
brief
deals
with
our
question
whether
they're
entitled
to
protection
of
securities
exchange
act.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
mr.
justice
douglas,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
people
thought
a
--
case
of
--
raise
quite
different
issues
with
respect
to
the
library
of
united
states.
the
issue
in
the
affiliated
ute
case
is
whether
the
district
court
properly
dismissed
the
action
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
finding
that
it
was
an
unpresented
pursuit
against
the
united
states.
the
issue
in
the
reyos
case
from
the
other
hand
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
properly
found
that
the
united
states
had
no
duty
to
prevent
terminated
mixed-blood
indians
from
selling
their
shares
at
less
than
fair
market
value.
although
the
case
has
raised
quite
different
issue
so
--
as
counsel
for
the
petitioner
had
said,
those
relate
to
the
ute
partition
act
of
1954.
and
i
think
that
that
fills
that
act
in
a
working
of
that
act
is
necessary
for
an
understanding
of
the
claims
in
these
cases.
in
1954,
the
ute
indian
tribe
of
the
uintah
and
ouray
reservation
in
utah
consisted
of
approximately
1800
members.
there
were
two
distinct
groups,
the
--
the
full-blood
indians
and
the
mixed-blood
indians.
the
mixed-blood
ute
indians
consisted
of
approximately
one
quarter
of
the
1803
--
1800
members
of
the
tribe.
for
a
number
of
years,
preceding
1954,
there
had
been
considerable
fixing
among
the
mixed-bloods
and
full-blood
indians.
the
reason
for
this
is
quite
understandable.
many
of
the
mixed-bloods
do
not
live
on
the
reservation.
many
of
the
mixed-bloods
were
already
integrated
within
the
non-indian
society
which
standard
of
living
was
virtually
indistinguishable
from
the
non-indian
society
in
which
they
live
and
their
educational
status
was
the
same.
the
crutching
between
these
two
groups
reached
its
peak
in
1950
and
1951
when
this
group
of
indians
went
on
ouray
reservation
became
entitled
to
60%
of
the
$31
million
budget
against
the
united
states.
the
full-blood
indians
also
quite
understandably
wished
to
increase
money
to
--
to
improve
their
reservation
to
build
schools
and
hospitals.
however,
many
of
the
mixed-bloods
wished
to
have
the
money
in
cash
and
had
no
interest
from
spending
it
on
a
reservation
where,
of
course,
they
never
lived
and
had
not
lived.
the
groups
met
in
tribal
council
over
a
period
of
approximately
one
year
to
work
up
these
differences.
the
ute
partition
act
of
1954
was
the
result
of
their
compromise
that
represent
more
than
anything
else
a
treaty
of
peace
between
these
two
groups
because
the
act
itself
is
drafted
and
hammered
out
by
the
indians
and
then
introduced
at
their
request
in
congress.
and
while
the
act
was
being
considered
by
congress,
both
representatives
of
the
mixed-blood
and
full-blood
group
went
to
washington
and
supported,
fully
supported
the
bill
and
said
that
if
we
submitted
to
a
vote
of
their
respective
membership
and
approve
overwhelmingly.
the
three
main
features
of
the
ute
partition
act,
one
is
the
division
of
the
tribal
assets
that
of
course
affected,
did
not
affect
the
individual
assets
held
by
the
individual
membership
tribe,
only
the
tribal
assets.
the
second
feature
is
the
combination
of
the
--
of
the
mixed-blood
indians
who
were
defined
as
having
--
as
having
not
more
than
one-half
ute
indian
blood.
the
third
feature
is
that
the
full-blood
with
--
the
trustee
relationship
between
the
united
states
and
the
full-blood
would
remain.
the
way
the
act
was
administered
and
the
way
this
partition
for
place
of
course
is
quite
complicated.
one
thing
that
can
be
said
about
it
is
that
we've
done
by
the
group
themselves
for
the
act
provided
that
the
group
was,
first
of
all,
first,
the
mixed-blood
and
full-blood
groups
were
be
together
and
divide
its
plan
for
--
for
dividing
their
efforts
between
them
one
on
the
judgement
of
the
relative
numbers
in
the
group.
this
turned
out
to
be
when
the
final
rolls
were
published
27%
mixed-blood
and
73%
full-blood.
the
next
--
the
next
step
in
the
process
was
to
have
the
mixed-blood
meet
by
themselves
and
determine
the
plans
of
distributing
these
assets.
the
plan
of
distribution
and
the
final
provision
were
contained
in
the
record
from
this
case.
one
of
the
difficulties,
of
course,
the
group
ran
into
with
how
to
distribute
assets
that
were
not
equally,
equitably
divided,
such
as
oil,
gas
and
mineral
rights.
when
the
--
when
the
ute
indians
were
considering
drafting
this
act,
the
court
realized
that
it
would
be
inequitable
to
split
up
just
solely
on
the
basis
of
geographical
consideration
the
mineral
rights.
approximately,
the
tribe
owns
at
that
time
approximately
one
million
acres
of
mineral
rights
which
is
approximately
the
size
of
delaware.
so
what
they
did
and
what
they
decided
to
do
is
to
retain
the
mineral
rights,
the
oil,
gas
and
mineral
rights
at
tribal
property
and
to
split
up
only
one
thing
or
only
two
things,
the
proceeds
from
the
mineral
rights
and
--
and
the
management.
the
management
was
to
be
joint.
the
proceeds
will
be
distributed
on
a
27%
and
73%
basis.
as
the
plans
worked
out
across
the
--
the
--
both
groups
via
its
representatives
who
negotiated
the
plans
and
work
them
out
for
them,
deprive
at
its
own
tribal
council,
and
that
was
no
problem.
however,
the
mixed-blood,
first
of
all,
adopted
a
constitution
forming
an
organization
known
as
affiliated
ute
citizens.
in
that
--
in
the
constitution
of
the
affiliated
ute
citizens
which
provided
the
delegating
authority
irrevocably
the
corporation
in
order
to
manage
certain
of
the
assets
of
the
mixed-blood
group.
three
corporations
were
formed,
the
rock
creek
cattle
company,
the
antelope-sheep
range
company
which
felt
with
graving
lands,
and
the
other,
ute
distribution
corporation,
which
is
involved
in
this
case.
the
corporation
was
formed
in
1958.
it
is
of
ten
shares
of
stock
to
each
individual
mixed-blood
indians
and
the
mixed-blood
hurdled
490
at
that
time.
this
range
is
appositive
of
the
case.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
they
specifically
authorize,
mr.
justice
white.
the
resolution
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes.
they
adopted
a
resolution.
they're
clear
after
that
way.
the
first
thing
that
i
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
it
was
a
general
membership
meeting
under
the
quorum
under
their
constitution.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
how
many
people
require
the
quorum,
mr.
justice
brennan?
30.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
30.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
i
don't
know.
it's
not
in
the
record.
the
issue
in
the
affiliated
--
i
was
(inaudible)
about
the
affiliated
ute
citizens
(inaudible)
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
there
were
two
aspects.
there's
an
(inaudible)
the
first
thing
was
when
they
--
when
they
divide
the
plan
of
distribution.
the
plan
of
distribution
had,
and
i
believe
it's
section
10,
was
similarly
appendix
to
the
amicus
brief
by
the
tribe
considered
in
full.
they
contemplated
in
forming
a
corporation.
that's
the
plan
to
handle
the
--
the
mineral
rights.
that
plan
was
unanimously
adopted
by
the
membership
or
at
least
so
it's
reported
in
a
--
in
a
--
or
in
a
resolution
by
affiliated
ute
citizens.
the
next
step
of
the
process
was
the
actual
delegation
of
the
authority
according
to
the
constitution
and
that
was
the
--
that
was
the
second
resolution
i
was
talking
to
a
few
minutes
ago
before
i
started
a
moment
ago.
i
said
our
--
first
of
the
issue
in
the
affiliated
ute
case
and
then
discussed
to
use
it
in
reyos.
the
affiliated
ute
case,
it
was
brought
--
the
suit
was
brought
by
this
unincorporated
association
purporting
to
represent
all
accommodated
mixed-blood
indians.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
they
were
supervised
throughout
until
1961
when
termination
took
place.
yes,
of
course,
there
was
constant
consultation.
and
i
might
add
there
--
there
was
a
contract
with
university
of
utah
which
provided
for
educational
service,
training
and
relocation
and
another
factor.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes.
the
plan
was
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
the
plan
was
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
--
worked
out.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
or
supervise,
yes.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
well,
it's
rather
an
informal
raise
--
what
is
the
tribe
--
was
the
mixed-blood
in
terms
of
their
own
plans
of
distribution.
it
was
a
full-blood
in
this
case
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes.
the
act
provided
for
the
plan
of
distribution
and
the
plan
of
division
of
the
tribal
assets,
yes.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
oh,
yes.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
677e
of
the
act
provided
specifically
for
this.
in
the
affiliated
ute
citizens
case
simply
brought
against
the
united
states
and
may
have
informed.
and
in
the
complaint,
the
claim
was
that
the
individual
members
of
this
organization
were
entitled
to
“an
individual
undivided
pro
rata
share
of
27%
of
approximately
1,200,000
acres
of
mineral
lands
subject
only
to
the
right
of
the
association
to
manage
that
property
jointly
to
the
tribal
business
council".
jurisdiction
was
invoked
primarily
under
25
u.s.c.
345.
the
district
court
dismissed
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
and
prepared
the
date
of
claim
upon
which
the
relief
would
be
granted.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
on
the
basis
that
this
was
an
(inaudible)
against
the
united
states
and
this
section
345
did
not
comply
the
necessary
percent
to
be
sued.
unlike
many
recent
cases
in
this
court
where
the
question
was
whether
a
suit
against
an
officer
of
the
united
states
was
really
a
suit
against
the
united
states,
this
--
this
case,
there's
no
such
question.
it
brought
directly
against
the
united
states
and
may
have
informed.
and
it's
long
been
held
in
this
court
that
a
suit
relating
to
government
property
against
the
united
states
cannot
be
brought
without
the
united
states'
consent.
the
principle
applies
equally
to
indian
land
held
in
cross
by
the
united
states
and
applies
also
when
the
suit
is
brought
by
a
group
of
indians
claiming
the
beneficial
interest
in
that
land.
in
this
case,
there's
no
dispute
whatsoever
that
the
united
states
holds
--
holds
title
in
trust
to
the
mineral
assets
on
the
reservation.
therefore,
plaintiff
action
in
order
to
go
forward
has
to
be
based
on
some
specific
statute,
federal
statute,
authorizing
this
kind
of
suit.
they've
invoked
section
25
u.s.c.
345.
that
section
which
is
setout
on
pages
90
to
91
of
our
brief
provides
that
any
person
who
are
wholer
in
blood
--
wholer
in
part
of
indian
blood
or
decent,
he
were
entitled
to
an
allotment
of
land
under
an
act
of
congress
were
claimed
to
be
so
entitled
or
under
any
allotment
act
or
any
under
grant
made
by
congress
or
the
claims
beyond
were
lawfully
denied
or
exclude
from
any
allotment
or
any
parcel
of
land
and
bring
action
in
the
district
court
to
determine,
and
the
jurisdictional
section
is
after
the
semicolon.
where
the
district
court
may
determine
any
action,
pursuit
or
proceeding
involving
the
right
of
any
person
pursuing
allotment
of
land,
we
think
this
case
does
not
fall
within
that
statute.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
they
asked
for
--
i'm
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes
i'm
not
exactly
clear
how
this
could
be
done
but
i
quote,
“they
kind
to
be
entitled
to
individual
undivided
pro
rata
share
of
27%
of
approximately
1,200,000
acres
of
minerals."
the
merit
to
that
question
has
never
been
reached.
allotment
is
a
term
of
art
in
indian
law.
and
the
latter
half
of
the
19th
century,
it
was
the
policy
of
united
states,
in
particular,
stressing
the
general
allotment
act
of
1887,
the
shift,
the
right
of
indian
in
real
property
consistently
participation
in
tribal
property
the
right
of
individual
ownership
in
particular
tracks.
the
land
or
the
mineral
estate
involved
in
this
case
is
a
very
(inaudible)
within
the
allotment
of
land
because
it's
never
been
divided.
it's
tribal
property.
there's
no
question
about
that.
there's
no
individual
ownership
of
this
land
involved.
in
the
usual
allotment
situation,
a
reservation
would
be
surveyed,
a
track
of
a
certain
number
of
acres
set
aside,
the
indian
would
make
a
selection
and
the
secretary
of
interior
would
issue
a
patent.
section
345
relates
only
to
those
kinds
of
situation.
you
think
this
is
not
a
suit
regarding
an
allotment
of
land
by
any
stretch
of
imagination.
for
now
to
the
reyos
case.
in
reyos,
there
were
12
designated
in
this
plaintiffs
the
claim
that
during
1963,
1964
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes.
we
pointed
that
out
in
our
brief,
mr.
justice
douglas.
it
was
stipulated,
i
might
point
out,
in
the
reyos
case
that
the
corporation
was
a
validly
formed
corporation
and
the
district
court
so
found.
the
whole
point
in
the
reyos
case
was
that
the
stock
has
substantial
value.
in
the
affiliated
ute
case
on
the
other
hand,
the
claim
--
the
corporation
was
invalid
and
that
it
should
never
been
given
the
assets
to
manage
to
begin
with.
we
think
there
are
basically
inconsistent.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
that's
right.
in
reyos,
the
12
designated
mixed-blood
plaintiffs
sold
their
stock
during
1963,
1964
and
1965.
it
sued
the
united
states
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
and
their
claim
was
that
the
government
was
negligent
by
selling
--
to
prevent
them
from
selling
their
own
shares
for
less
than
fair
market
value.
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
held
that
the
trust
relationship
between
the
government
and
each
individual
mixed-blood
terminated
in
1961
before
any
of
the
sales
took
place
and
that
the
government
therefore
had
no
duty
to
supervise
mixed-blood
sellers
disposing
of
their
stocks.
they
pointed
out
under
the
act
that
oil,
gas
and
minerals
were
owned
by
the
tribe
and
were
not
divided.
but
the
proceeds
were
and
the
management
rights
were
divided.the
mixed-blood
formed
udc
in
1958
may
issue
stock.
under
677d
of
the
act,
the
secretary
of
interior
on
august
27th,
1961,
and
this
is
on
page
40
of
our
brief,
issued
a
termination
proclamation
stating,
“with
respect
to
each
and
every
individual
mixed-blood,
federal
restriction
from
the
property
have
been
removed.
the
federal
trust
relationship
of
such
individual
is
terminated.
that
such
individual
shall
not
be
entitled
to
any
of
the
services
performed
for
indians
because
of
his
status
as
an
indian
and
all
statutes
of
the
united
states
which
affecting
the
--
the
course
of
their
status
of
indians
shall
no
longer
be
applicable."
we
think
that
after
this
period,
secretary
of
interior
had
no
duty
to
say
perhaps
indeed
no
right
to
say
to
an
indian,
“you
can't
sell
your
stock
for
that
amount”
or
“i'll
only
let
you
sell
your
stock
if
you
really
need
the
money
at
this
time”
or
even
had
he
might
have
said
that
these
were
restricted
indian
property,
“you
can
only
sell
your
stock
if
you
spend
the
money
in
the
proceed
for
--
for
food
and
clothing
for
you
and
--
and
your
family”.
we
think
that
after
1961,
he
not
only
had
no
duty
to
do
that,
i
think
the
mixed-blood
would
be
--
would
have
been
infuriated
if
he
had
tried
to
do
that.
the
plaintiff
had
claimed
however
that
there's
--
right
there
was
a
right
of
first
refusal
and
that
they
claimed
this
right
of
first
refusal
somehow
created
the
duty
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
specifically
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
to
supervise
their
shares
even
after
1961.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
it's
not
entirely
clear,
mr.
justice
brennan.
we
think
the
right
of
first
refusal
stems
from
article
viii
of
the
articles
of
incorporation
of
ute
distribution
corporation
which
provides
that
any
mixed-blood
who
sell
their
shares
before
august
27th,
1964
must
first
offer
them
to
members
of
the
tribe.
there's
no
acceptance
of
that
offer.
he
may
then
sell
the
same
or
greater
amount
under
the
same
terms
and
conditions
offered
for
the
members.
the
secretary
of
interior
was
--
was
required
under
the
articles
of
incorporation
certified
of
one
thing,
that
he
offered
to
members
of
the
tribe
was
made
in
accordance
with
the
law
and
regulations
of
the
secretary
of
interior.
that
is
the
original
offer
which,
if
not
accepted,
would
allow
the
mixed-blood
to
sell
to
whom
he
may
please.
this
is
contained
on
page
6
of
the
exhibit
appendix.
also,
the
regulation
finally,
i
--
i
may
point
out,
that
under
the
act,
under
677n
of
the
act
was
a
similar
right
of
first
refusal
for
land.
and
so
when
the
secretary
promulgated
regulations
dealing
with
the
right
of
first
refusal
for
land,
the
very
last
clause
in
those
regulations
stated
that
as
far
as
practicable,
these
regulations
should
apply
to
sales
of
stocks
in
the
corporations
formed
by
the
mixed-blood.
the
bank
operated
its
transfer
agent
for
the
stock
and
the
ute
distribution
corporation
and
the
bank
worked
out
a
procedure
in
september
of
1963.
i
might
point
out
at
this
point
that
there
were
no
sales
of
stock
until
the
late
summer
of
1963.
in
the
time
of
corporation
was
forming
until
december
of
1963,
there
were
no
sales
of
stocks,
the
first
sale
took
place,
i
think,
approximately
august
of
1963.
the
bank
work
out
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes,
it
should
be.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes.
please,
please.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
i'm
very
sorry
about
that.
in
any
event,
the
--
the
bank
operated
its
transfer
agent
of
stock.
and
they
worked
out
a
procedure
with
the
ute
distribution
corporation
whereby,
and
this
is
contained
on
page
29
and
31
--
29
and
31
of
the
exhibit
appendix,
whereby
after
the
offer
had
been
made
and
not
taken
up
by
a
member
of
the
tribe
to
seller,
when
he
completed
the
sale
would
furnished
an
affidavit
and
a
stock
power
to
the
--
including
the
superintendent
of
reservation.
and
then
the
superintendent
of
reservation
would
issue
the
certificate
stating
that
the
offer,
the
original
offer
had
been
properly
made
to
the
bank,
he
would
then
transfer
the
stock
to
the
buyer.
apparently,
the
main
thing
according
to
petitions
of
the
superintendent
did
wrong
here
was
that
he
failed
to
investigate
whether
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
were
telling
the
truth
on
their
affidavit.
the
superintendent
apparently
thought
that
the
regulations
in
the
ute
distribution
articles
of
incorporation
required
only
to
certify
that
the
original
offer
was
proper.
and
i
think
maybe
that
was
too
strict
in
interpretation
of
the
regulation.
however,
the
one
thing
which
seemed
perfectly
clear
is
that
the
right
of
first
refusal
did
not
create
any
duty
for
the
people
that
were
selling
the
stock.
this
apparently
had
not
called
it's
true
from
their
affidavit
because
the
right
of
first
refusal
of
anything
was
for
the
benefit
of
the
people
who
(inaudible).
it's
for
the
benefit
of
the
people
who
remained
in
--
remained
in
the
tribe
and
also
for
the
mixed-blood
so
they
could
retain
control
of
their
corporation.
the
seller
obviously
cannot
accept
its
own
offer
and
we
think
therefore
that
this
created
no
duty
to
the
people
who
bring
this
suit,
the
mixed-blood
seller
who
claimed
there
had
been
--
have
sold
for
less
than
fair
market
value.
we
don't
think
they're
entirely
without
protection
however.
i
think
--
and
point
3
--
part
3
of
our
brief
deals
with
our
question
whether
they're
entitled
to
protection
of
securities
exchange
act.
