does
employees
involve
with
a
union
representative
if
he
chose
his
right
at
the
first
step?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
every
step
after
that
apparently
has
to
be
handled
by
the
steps
two
and
three
and
up
to
arbitration
at
any
event,
it
has
to
be
handled
by
union
representatives,
is
it
under
grievance
and
arbitration?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
apart
from
that,
i
gather
you
rely
in
any
event
on
the
14
individual
employees,
and
not
even
discuss
the
process
of
grievance
with
the
immediate
supervisor,
is
that
right?
justice
william

what
then
--
what
then
have
the
grievance
procedure
been
involved
by
the
14
employees?
what
would
have
gone
to
arbitration
if
there
had
not
been
charges?
what
would
the
arbitrator
had
to
decide?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

well,
if
that's
so,
then
there
is
a
matter
of
construction
and
application
of
the
contract.
there
is
an
issue
of
arbitration
or
the
construction
of
application
of
the
contract?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

you
said
to
mr.
justice
douglas
that
there
wasn't
any?
