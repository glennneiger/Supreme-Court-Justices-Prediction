what
was
the
claiming

was
it
for

justice

sovereign’s
pay
under
the
contract?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
not
damage
for
wrongful
discharge,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
of
course
in
maddox
the
only
substantive
right
he
had
to
sovereign’s
pay
was
by
the
reason
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
court
may
look
at
it,
but
here
at
least
you
do
have
in
the
background
fair
labor
standards
act
which
give
overtime
for
pay
and
a
half
where
in
they
work
eight
hours
a
day
for
40
hours
a
week?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
except
the
fair
labor
standards
act
is
more
than
remedial
rights,
does
it
not?
it
gets
substantive
rights
to
pay
and
a
half
over
eight
hours
a
day
or
40
hours
a
week?
justice
potter
stewart
so
if
there
were
no
collective
bargaining
agreement
here,
you
would
concede
that
on
the
allegations
of
the
plaintiff’s
complaint,
they
have
a
course
of
action
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
would
that
not
be
true?

if
there

is
that
