mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it
is
important
to
get
to
the
precise
nature
of
the
employee’s
claim
in
this
case
in
proper
focus
right
at
the
outset.
the
employees
have
never
claimed
throughout
these
entire
proceedings
that
their
employer
violated
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
a
complaint
which
is
set
out
on
pages
82
to
84
of
the
appendix
is
related
solely
to
the
rights
under
fair
labor
standards
act.
obviously,
they
are
not
seeking
a
work
free
lunch
period
for
time
between
1965
and
1967.
as
times
passed,
the
work
free
lunch
period
even
if
the
employer
said
you
are
entitled
to
it
would
not
help
them
at
all.
what
they
are
seeking
is
simply
wages
that
they
claim
were
due
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
the
fair
labor
standards
act
only
provides
a
(voice
overlap)
compensation.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
over
40
hours
in
the
workplace.
they
claim
they
worked
within
the
meaning
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
for
over
40
hours
in
work
week
because
they
were
on
call
for
this
30-minute
period
each
day
and
that
they
were
entitled
to
pay
and
that
the
employer
violated
the
fair
labor
standards
act
by
not
paying
them.
the
standard
--
fair
labor
standards
act
claim,
the
point
is
that
even
if
the
contract
in
this
case
said
that
employees
were
not
entitled
to
pay
for
on
call
time,
that
would
be
irrelevant
because
it
has
been
held
by
this
court
in
three-decade
period
after
an
act
under
the
fair
labor
standards
acts
that
unions
cannot
bargain
away
the
employees
rights
under
the
act.
the
act
is
set
up
to
create
a
uniform
standard
throughout
the
country
that
does
not
vary
from
industry
to
industry
or
employer
to
employer.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
the
government
does
not
challenge
that,
although
the
co-counsel
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
co-counsel
has
raised
that
issue
and
he
will
argue
that
point.
the
government
will
assume
that
the
grievance
was
arbitrable.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
well,
i
think
there
are
many,
many
reasons.
i
think
that
examining
those
reasons
has
to
begin
with
examination
of
the
statute
itself.
as
i
have
said,
these
employees
sued
solely
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
they
sued
under
section
16
(b)
of
the
act
which
is
set
out
in
respondent’s
brief
on
pages
f,
on
page
a2.
under
section
16
(b),
an
employee
is
entitled
to
sue,
“in
any
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
to
recover
minimum
wages
or
overtime
compensation
withheld
in
violation
of
the
act.”
also,
under
section
16
(b),
an
employer
is
entitled
to
liquidate
the
damages
in
an
equal
amount
to
the
wages
that
were
unlawfully
withheld
unless
the
employer
“shows
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
court
that
he
acted
in
good
faith
and
did
not
and
had
reasonable
grounds
for
violating
the
act.”
in
that
situation,
“the
court
may
in
its
sound
discretion
order
a
lesser
amount
of
liquidated
damages.”
also
under
act
an
employee
is
entitled
to
attorney’s
fees
from
the
defendant
if
he
prevails
and
also
he
is
entitled
to
two
years
within
which
to
bring
his
suit
or
if
the
employer’s
violation
was
willful
he
is
entitled
to
three
years.
the
government
contends
that
all
these
are
matters
of
substance.
it
is
quite
important
to
enforcement
of
the
act
and
the
forum
where
the
rights
are
to
be
enforced
is
tied
up
with
the
very
rights
and
remedies
of
the
act.
it
is
an
integral
part
of
the
statutory
structure.
indeed,
section
16
(b)
itself
speaks
of
“the
right
to
bring
an
action
and
we
think
that
when
congress
said,
employees
have
a
right
to
bring
an
action”
they
meant
just
that.
they
did
not
mean
that
employees
have
a
right
to
bring
an
action
unless
they
are
governed
by
collective
bargaining
agreement,
in
which
case
they
may
or
if
they
have
to
go
to
arbitration
of
the
grievance
processes
first.
we
think
examination,
close
examination
of
all
these
provisions
in
the
act,
particularly
in
light
of
their
legislative
history
leads
to
this
conclusion.
first
of
all
let
us
look
at
liquidated
damages.
arbitrators
as
this
court
has
pointed
out
in
steelworkers
charge,
these
are
confined
to
an
interpretation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
award
is
totally
valid
only
so
long
as
it
draws
its
essence
from
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
in
that
situation
and
that
is
the
situation
in
this
case,
under
this
collective
bargaining
agreement,
it
is
doubtful
at
first
whether
an
arbitrator
could
award
liquidated
damages.
it
would
have
to
go
beyond
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
to
do
so.
let's
suppose
he
could,
suppose
the
court
says
that
we
can
apply
that?
well
even
if
he
could,
the
point
is
congress
said
the
court
should
decide.
it
is
a
court,
judicial
discretion
which
is
guided
by
sound
legal
principles
is
to
be
exercised
in
determining
whether
liquidated
damages
should
be
given.
more
important,
i
have
been
assuming
that
case
goes
to
arbitration,
but
under
this
collective
bargaining
agreement
which
quite
typical
after
the
very
first
step,
the
union
has
control
over
the
grievance.
the
point
is
that
the
grievance
may
well
be
settled
along
the
way
before
it
reaches
arbitration.
indeed
this
court
has
pointed
on
many
occasions
that
this
is
the
preferable
way
of
handling
disputes
to
get
them
settled
because
the
grievance
process
itself
is
considered
part
of
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
only
trouble
is
that
is
absolutely
clear
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act
that
the
minimum
rights
are
not
to
be
thrown
on
the
bargaining
table
so
that
the
union
and
employer
can
bargain
agreement.
this
is
something
that
that
congress
gave
the
employees.
it
is
a
minimum
standard
and
it
is
not
to
be
reduced
even
upon
agreement
by
the
employer
and
the
union.
indeed,
in
the
sholty
case
which
was
decided
back
in
the
1940
and
we
discussed
in
our
brier
on
pages
16
to
17,
this
court
held
that
even
in
an
individual
employee
entering
into
a
settlement,
a
bona
fide
settlement
agreement
over
a
claim
with
his
employer
could
not
be
held
to
have
waived
his
right
to
liquidate
the
damages,
so
let
us
go
to
union
and
do
it
for
him.
also,
the
act
as
i
said
before
provides
that
employee
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
supposing
--
my
point
is
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
my
point
is
that
before
you
--
arbitration
may
or
may
not
happen.
now
the
claim
here
is
that
the
employee
should
subject
their
fair
labor
standards
act
claims
to
the
grievance
process
which
may
or
may
not
lead
to
arbitration.
my
point
was
that
suppose
the
grievance
process
works
as
it
is
supposed
to
work
that
is
the
claim
is
settled
between
the
union
and
employer
before
it
reaches
arbitration.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
that
is
right.
and
my
point
is
that
if
that
is
true
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
no,
my
point
is,
i
conclude
from
that
the
congress
could
not
possibly
have
intended
the
employees
to
go
through
the
grievance
process
before
they
submit
their
claims
in
court.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
sorry?
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
i
am
taking
about
what
congress
intended
whether
--
and
i
think
that
congress
had
--
knew
that
as
well
as
i
do.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
well,
this
court
has
held
that
one
that
when
the
dispute
between
the
employer
and
the
union,
this
is
the
sholty
case
involves
a
question
whether
the
act,
in
fact
congress
then
that
the
only
time
the
employee
can
bound
to
a
settlement
agreement
is
that
the
settlement
agreement
is
upon
a
stipulated
judgment.
if
a
settlement
is
outside
the
court,
it
will
not
be
upheld.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
oh!
no,
not
at
all.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
it
is
certainly
better
that
the
employer
would
comply
from
the
outset.
i
guess
the
next
best
thing
is
that
he
would
comply
as
soon
as
the
employee
complains.
i
certainly
would
hope
that
if
the
employee
does
find
out
the
violation
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
well,
that
is
interesting
history.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes,
i
think
the
government
does.
the
reason
is
this.
that
if
the
employee
and
employer
get
together
and
settle
claim
for
less
than
the
amount
that
was
due,
that
gives
the
employer
an
advantage
over
his
competitors
who
are
bound
to
the
minimum
standards
of
the
act.
suppose
for
an
example,
an
individual
employee
is
only
paying
his
employees
a
dollar
an
hour
when
he
is
supposed
to
be
paying
him
$1.60,
employees
come
to
him
and
say,
you
are
violating
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
please
pay
as
the
amount
we
are
due
and
they
compromise
on
a
$1.30
an
hour.
well,
that
gives
an
employer
an
advantage
and
its
also
gives
the
employer
who
can
bargain
the
hardest
with
his
employees,
the
advantage
of
getting
that
increase.
i
think
it
is
absolutely
clear
that
congress
never
intended
that.
they
wanted
uniform
application.
these
are
the
reasons
that
lead
the
court
in
the
sholty
case
and
indeed
in
the
brooklyn
bank
case
back
in
1943
to
hold
that
settlement
agreements
were
not
valid,
that
employees
could
not
be
bound
by
that
and
that
they
can
come
into
court
and
get
more.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
no,
i
said
they
can
settle,
but
i
think
the
government
has
an
interest
in
making
sure
that
they
get
exactly
what
they
are
entitled
to
under
the
act.
now,
the
question
whether
they
can
settle
over
the
bona
fide
dispute
involving
the
number
of
hours
they
should
be
paid
has
never
been
before
this
court.
i
do
not
think
it
is
essential
for
this
case.
i
mean
i
think
they
have
many
other
things
under
the
act
that
indicate
that
congress
could
not
have
been
intended
them
to
go
through
the
grievance
process.
for
example,
the
limitations
on
action
when
congress
gave
these
employers
two
years
within
which
to
sue
before
1947,
state
law
controlled
the
statute
of
limitations.
they
were
diversion
views
and
congress
found
in
1947
that
this
lack
of
uniformity
has
created
an
undesirable
situation
in
the
united
states.
they
therefore
set
a
two-year
federal
standard.
the
point
is
they
did
this
not
only
to
get
uniformity
but
because
they
believe
employees
might
not
generally
know
their
rights
under
the
act
and
needed
that
long
period
of
time
within
which
to
bring
their
suit.
suppose
we
accept
the
employer's
claim
in
this
case
that
employees
are
barred
from
court
because
they
did
not
invoke
grievance
procedures
when
they
were
available.
this
would
bring
about
even
greater
lack
of
uniformity
and
that's
precisely
what
congress
legislated
against
because
if
they
take
it
that
would
mean
that
when
the
grievance
process
was
available
they
would
be
bound
by
the
terms
of
the
grievance
process
which
may
set
its
own
time
limits
or
when
they
could
bring
the
grievance.
in
this
case,
except
to
(inaudible)
mr.
justice
white
you
asked
my
colleague
here
whether
there
is
no
any
limit
on
the
first
step.
as
i
read
the
contract
which
is
set
down
on
829,
the
appendix
says,
yes,
10
days.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
in
the
event
he
does
receive
a
satisfactory
answer
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
--
he
shall
within
10
days
of
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
well,
it
is
titled
step
one
in
the
contact
that
is
what
i
was
referring
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
no,
but
i
think
that
the
way
i
read
it,
it
says
he
shall
submit
within
10
days
of
knowledge
of
the
incident.
that
certainly
means
the
incident
he
is
complaining
about.
so
after
he
goes
to
his
employer
says
and
says,
look
you
are
doing
something
wrong
under
the
contract
then
within
10
days,
he
has
to
file
a
written
grievance.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes.
no,
i
do
not
write
that
out.
if
he
does
receive
a
satisfactory
answer,
of
course,
there
is
no
reason
for
him
to
file
a
written
grievance,
but
the
point
is
that
all
collective
bargaining
agreements
set
their
own
time
limits
and
that
is
precisely
the
contrary
what
congress
wanted.
they
wanted
a
uniform
standard
throughout
the
country
and
they
did
not
want
10
days
or
15
days,
or
a
year,
they
wanted
two
years.
so
further
indication,
i
think
this
is
quite
important
is
that
before
1947,
unions
could
bring
actions
on
behalf
of
their
own
employees.
but
in
1947,
congress
under
section
16
(b),
deleted
the
provision
allowing
representative
actions
so
that
now
16
(b)
reads
“that
only
the
employee
himself
controls
and
prosecutes
his
own
action.”
compare
that
to
the
grievance
process,
it
is
precisely
the
opposite
of
what
congress
said
because
in
the
grievance
process,
beyond
the
very
first
step
where
the
employee
steps
down
as
written
grievance
it
is
the
union
that
controls
prosecution
of
the
claims.
that
is
directly
contrary
to
a
congress
legislated
in
1947.
so
further
and
i
think
i
have
been
talking
about
this
already,
the
point
is
that
the
maximum
hours
provision
is
concerned
more
simply
than
we
ware
simply
helping
the
industry.
this
is
an
important
part
of
the
helping
the
individual
employee
bear
the
burden
of
having
to
worked
over
40
hours,
concerned
with
more
than
that,
because
one
of
the
reasons
that
congress
set
down
a
limit
on
maximum
hours
is
to
spread
employment
throughout
the
country
by
exerting
pressure
on
employee
--
employers
to
hire
more
people
rather
than
working
the
people
they
have
in
an
overtime.
also,
since
the
minimum
standards
apply
throughout
the
country.
they
have
to
be
applied
uniformly.
if
they
are
not,
one
employer
gains
an
advantage
over
his
competitors.
congress
could
not
possibly
have
thought
that
they
could
realize,
that
these
goals
could
be
realized
from
the
grievance
process
or
even
through
arbitration.
the
claims
are
settled
by
the
union
and
the
employer
along
the
way.
the
lack
of
uniformity
is
quite
obvious.
each
employer
in
each
industry
is
going
to
be
treated
differently
because
the
grievance
process
is
tailored
to
the
particular
problems
of
the
plant,
but
even
if
the
matter
reaches
arbitration,
arbitrators
are
not
necessarily
trained
in
the
law.
they
don't
necessarily
fall
to
stare
decisis.
they
do
not
have
to
give
reasons
for
their
opinions.
their
record
is
not
as
complete
as
in
a
judicial
trial.
there
is
very
limited
judicial
review
of
what
they
held
and
all
these
factors
are
quite
important
if
you
are
going
to
have
uniform
interpretation
of
what
is
in
fact
of
the
fourteenth
federal
enactment
that
applies
to
people
throughout
the
country.
in
addition,
finally,
congress
in
section
16
(c)
and
section
17
of
the
act
said
the
secretary
of
labor
can
enforce
it
even
when
the
employee
himself
is
unwilling
or
unable
to
bring
the
action.
now,
we
think
that
it
the
secretary
has
direct
access
to
the
court,
it
makes
little
sense
to
say
that
employees
don't,
that
they
have
to
go
though
the
grievance
process
where
secretary
can
bring
an
action
directly
in
court
and
that
the
employee
--
mr.
a.

that
is
true,
the
secretary
has
to
enforce
--
the
secretary
is
not
(voice
overlap)
contract
right,
that
is
the
important
thing
and
neither
is
the
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
well,
first
of
all
this
is
purely
statutory.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
it
is
purely
statutory
claim.
the
contract
here
is
limited
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
well,
i
said
it
is
doubtful
at
best
whether
they
can
award
liquidated
damages.
the
employee
is
entitled
to
twice
--
to
twice
the
amount
of
the
damages
and
i
take
it
if
the
–-
suppose
the
contract
is
violated,
what
does
that
mean?
that
means
the
employer
owes
the
employee
for
the
amount
he
has
not
taken.
the
arbitrator
is
confined
to
the
contract
that
is
what
he
awards.
the
statute
does
no
say
that.
it
says,
we
think
the
employees
are
damaged
even
more
than
that
and
they
are
entitled
to
an
equal
amount.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
that
is
right.
in
this
case.
i
am
saying
in
general
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
no,
i
said,
i
would
assume
that.
i
did
not
admit
it.
i
said
i
will
assume
that
for
the
purposes
of
my
argument.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
then
i
say
it
is
doubtful
at
best
whether
the
arbitrator
is
going
to
award
the
liquidated
damages.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
no,
because
my
assumption
was
--
my
assumption
went
to
the
question
whether
the
arbitrator
can
determine
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act
whether
this
was
worth
and
i
assume
he
can,
but
i
am
talking
about
the
remedies
he
gives
after
he
makes
that
determination.
whether
they
are
governed
by
the
contract
or
not
is
doubtful
at
best
and
the
point
is
that
this
is
supposed
to
be
uniform
throughout
the
county
and
it
should
in
turn
what
the
contract
says.
moreover,
in
the
republic
steel
case,
this
court’s
decision
in
the
republic
steel
case
is
quite
distinguishable
from
here
because
republic
steel
dealt
only
with
the
question
of
contract
interpretation.
the
point
is
neither
congress
nor
this
court
has
ever
said
that
grievance
proceedings
in
the
labor
contract
is
a
preferred
method
of
vindicating
an
employees'
statutory
rights
independent
of
the
contract.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
you
may
continue
mr.
randolph.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
was
discussing
the
bulk
carrier’s
case
which
this
court
decided
last
term.
i
also
made
reference
to
the
mckinney
case
which
was
decided
in
1957
which
we
have
discussed
on
pages
24
to
25
of
our
brief.
in
both
of
these
cases,
this
court
held
that
when
congress
provided,
the
court
should
be
the
forum
for
enforcing
an
employees'
statutory
rights,
the
employee
was
entitled
to
direct
the
access
to
the
courts.
the
court
so
held
in
both
cases
even
though
the
contract
grievance
procedures
were
available
and
even
though
determination
of
the
employees'
statutory
rights
required
interpretation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
we
think
this
is
even
a
stronger
case
because
in
this
case,
they
said
at
the
outset,
the
employees'
claims
did
not
require
interpretation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
their
claims
under
the
act
of
overtime
compensation
are
derived
entirely
from
the
fair
labor
standards
act
and
we
think
this
case
is
also
stronger
than
bulk
carriers
and
mckinney
because
congress'
intent
to
afford
direct
access
to
the
courts
is
even
more
apparent
than
the
provisions
and
policies
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
and
it
was
with
the
respect
of
the
statutes
involved
in
mckinney
and
bulk
carriers.
over
the
three
decades,
that
have
passed
since
enactment
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
in
1938,
a
considerable
body
of
federal
law
has
developed
through
the
state
and
federal
court
decisions
construing
and
applying
the
act.
these
decisions
and
the
acts
provisions
and
legislative
history
together
with
administrative
determinations
must
be
considered
in
deciding
the
merits
of
every
case
that
arises
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
the
point
is
this
is
a
job
for
the
courts
and
the
not
arbitrators.
an
important
point
is
that
congress
made
it
a
job
for
the
courts
and
certainly
not
a
task
that
can
be
handled
through
bargaining
by
the
union
and
the
employer
in
grievance
proceeding,
particularly
since
employees’
rights,
the
minimum
wages,
and
overtime
compensation
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act
cannot
be
bargained
away.
for
these
reasons,
we
urge
the
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
iowa.
thank
you.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it
is
important
to
get
to
the
precise
nature
of
the
employee’s
claim
in
this
case
in
proper
focus
right
at
the
outset.
the
employees
have
never
claimed
throughout
these
entire
proceedings
that
their
employer
violated
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
a
complaint
which
is
set
out
on
pages
82
to
84
of
the
appendix
is
related
solely
to
the
rights
under
fair
labor
standards
act.
obviously,
they
are
not
seeking
a
work
free
lunch
period
for
time
between
1965
and
1967.
as
times
passed,
the
work
free
lunch
period
even
if
the
employer
said
you
are
entitled
to
it
would
not
help
them
at
all.
what
they
are
seeking
is
simply
wages
that
they
claim
were
due
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
the
fair
labor
standards
act
only
provides
a
(voice
overlap)
compensation.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
over
40
hours
in
the
workplace.
they
claim
they
worked
within
the
meaning
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
for
over
40
hours
in
work
week
because
they
were
on
call
for
this
30-minute
period
each
day
and
that
they
were
entitled
to
pay
and
that
the
employer
violated
the
fair
labor
standards
act
by
not
paying
them.
the
standard
--
fair
labor
standards
act
claim,
the
point
is
that
even
if
the
contract
in
this
case
said
that
employees
were
not
entitled
to
pay
for
on
call
time,
that
would
be
irrelevant
because
it
has
been
held
by
this
court
in
three-decade
period
after
an
act
under
the
fair
labor
standards
acts
that
unions
cannot
bargain
away
the
employees
rights
under
the
act.
the
act
is
set
up
to
create
a
uniform
standard
throughout
the
country
that
does
not
vary
from
industry
to
industry
or
employer
to
employer.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
the
government
does
not
challenge
that,
although
the
co-counsel
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
co-counsel
has
raised
that
issue
and
he
will
argue
that
point.
the
government
will
assume
that
the
grievance
was
arbitrable.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
well,
i
think
there
are
many,
many
reasons.
i
think
that
examining
those
reasons
has
to
begin
with
examination
of
the
statute
itself.
as
i
have
said,
these
employees
sued
solely
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
they
sued
under
section
16
(b)
of
the
act
which
is
set
out
in
respondent’s
brief
on
pages
f,
on
page
a2.
under
section
16
(b),
an
employee
is
entitled
to
sue,
“in
any
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
to
recover
minimum
wages
or
overtime
compensation
withheld
in
violation
of
the
act.”
also,
under
section
16
(b),
an
employer
is
entitled
to
liquidate
the
damages
in
an
equal
amount
to
the
wages
that
were
unlawfully
withheld
unless
the
employer
“shows
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
court
that
he
acted
in
good
faith
and
did
not
and
had
reasonable
grounds
for
violating
the
act.”
in
that
situation,
“the
court
may
in
its
sound
discretion
order
a
lesser
amount
of
liquidated
damages.”
also
under
act
an
employee
is
entitled
to
attorney’s
fees
from
the
defendant
if
he
prevails
and
also
he
is
entitled
to
two
years
within
which
to
bring
his
suit
or
if
the
employer’s
violation
was
willful
he
is
entitled
to
three
years.
the
government
contends
that
all
these
are
matters
of
substance.
it
is
quite
important
to
enforcement
of
the
act
and
the
forum
where
the
rights
are
to
be
enforced
is
tied
up
with
the
very
rights
and
remedies
of
the
act.
it
is
an
integral
part
of
the
statutory
structure.
indeed,
section
16
(b)
itself
speaks
of
“the
right
to
bring
an
action
and
we
think
that
when
congress
said,
employees
have
a
right
to
bring
an
action”
they
meant
just
that.
they
did
not
mean
that
employees
have
a
right
to
bring
an
action
unless
they
are
governed
by
collective
bargaining
agreement,
in
which
case
they
may
or
if
they
have
to
go
to
arbitration
of
the
grievance
processes
first.
we
think
examination,
close
examination
of
all
these
provisions
in
the
act,
particularly
in
light
of
their
legislative
history
leads
to
this
conclusion.
first
of
all
let
us
look
at
liquidated
damages.
arbitrators
as
this
court
has
pointed
out
in
steelworkers
charge,
these
are
confined
to
an
interpretation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
award
is
totally
valid
only
so
long
as
it
draws
its
essence
from
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
in
that
situation
and
that
is
the
situation
in
this
case,
under
this
collective
bargaining
agreement,
it
is
doubtful
at
first
whether
an
arbitrator
could
award
liquidated
damages.
it
would
have
to
go
beyond
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
to
do
so.
let's
suppose
he
could,
suppose
the
court
says
that
we
can
apply
that?
well
even
if
he
could,
the
point
is
congress
said
the
court
should
decide.
it
is
a
court,
judicial
discretion
which
is
guided
by
sound
legal
principles
is
to
be
exercised
in
determining
whether
liquidated
damages
should
be
given.
more
important,
i
have
been
assuming
that
case
goes
to
arbitration,
but
under
this
collective
bargaining
agreement
which
quite
typical
after
the
very
first
step,
the
union
has
control
over
the
grievance.
the
point
is
that
the
grievance
may
well
be
settled
along
the
way
before
it
reaches
arbitration.
indeed
this
court
has
pointed
on
many
occasions
that
this
is
the
preferable
way
of
handling
disputes
to
get
them
settled
because
the
grievance
process
itself
is
considered
part
of
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
only
trouble
is
that
is
absolutely
clear
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act
that
the
minimum
rights
are
not
to
be
thrown
on
the
bargaining
table
so
that
the
union
and
employer
can
bargain
agreement.
this
is
something
that
that
congress
gave
the
employees.
it
is
a
minimum
standard
and
it
is
not
to
be
reduced
even
upon
agreement
by
the
employer
and
the
union.
indeed,
in
the
sholty
case
which
was
decided
back
in
the
1940
and
we
discussed
in
our
brier
on
pages
16
to
17,
this
court
held
that
even
in
an
individual
employee
entering
into
a
settlement,
a
bona
fide
settlement
agreement
over
a
claim
with
his
employer
could
not
be
held
to
have
waived
his
right
to
liquidate
the
damages,
so
let
us
go
to
union
and
do
it
for
him.
also,
the
act
as
i
said
before
provides
that
employee
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
supposing
--
my
point
is
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
my
point
is
that
before
you
--
arbitration
may
or
may
not
happen.
now
the
claim
here
is
that
the
employee
should
subject
their
fair
labor
standards
act
claims
to
the
grievance
process
which
may
or
may
not
lead
to
arbitration.
my
point
was
that
suppose
the
grievance
process
works
as
it
is
supposed
to
work
that
is
the
claim
is
settled
between
the
union
and
employer
before
it
reaches
arbitration.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
that
is
right.
and
my
point
is
that
if
that
is
true
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
no,
my
point
is,
i
conclude
from
that
the
congress
could
not
possibly
have
intended
the
employees
to
go
through
the
grievance
process
before
they
submit
their
claims
in
court.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
sorry?
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
i
am
taking
about
what
congress
intended
whether
--
and
i
think
that
congress
had
--
knew
that
as
well
as
i
do.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
well,
this
court
has
held
that
one
that
when
the
dispute
between
the
employer
and
the
union,
this
is
the
sholty
case
involves
a
question
whether
the
act,
in
fact
congress
then
that
the
only
time
the
employee
can
bound
to
a
settlement
agreement
is
that
the
settlement
agreement
is
upon
a
stipulated
judgment.
if
a
settlement
is
outside
the
court,
it
will
not
be
upheld.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
oh!
no,
not
at
all.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
it
is
certainly
better
that
the
employer
would
comply
from
the
outset.
i
guess
the
next
best
thing
is
that
he
would
comply
as
soon
as
the
employee
complains.
i
certainly
would
hope
that
if
the
employee
does
find
out
the
violation
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
well,
that
is
interesting
history.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes,
i
think
the
government
does.
the
reason
is
this.
that
if
the
employee
and
employer
get
together
and
settle
claim
for
less
than
the
amount
that
was
due,
that
gives
the
employer
an
advantage
over
his
competitors
who
are
bound
to
the
minimum
standards
of
the
act.
suppose
for
an
example,
an
individual
employee
is
only
paying
his
employees
a
dollar
an
hour
when
he
is
supposed
to
be
paying
him
$1.60,
employees
come
to
him
and
say,
you
are
violating
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
please
pay
as
the
amount
we
are
due
and
they
compromise
on
a
$1.30
an
hour.
well,
that
gives
an
employer
an
advantage
and
its
also
gives
the
employer
who
can
bargain
the
hardest
with
his
employees,
the
advantage
of
getting
that
increase.
i
think
it
is
absolutely
clear
that
congress
never
intended
that.
they
wanted
uniform
application.
these
are
the
reasons
that
lead
the
court
in
the
sholty
case
and
indeed
in
the
brooklyn
bank
case
back
in
1943
to
hold
that
settlement
agreements
were
not
valid,
that
employees
could
not
be
bound
by
that
and
that
they
can
come
into
court
and
get
more.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
no,
i
said
they
can
settle,
but
i
think
the
government
has
an
interest
in
making
sure
that
they
get
exactly
what
they
are
entitled
to
under
the
act.
now,
the
question
whether
they
can
settle
over
the
bona
fide
dispute
involving
the
number
of
hours
they
should
be
paid
has
never
been
before
this
court.
i
do
not
think
it
is
essential
for
this
case.
i
mean
i
think
they
have
many
other
things
under
the
act
that
indicate
that
congress
could
not
have
been
intended
them
to
go
through
the
grievance
process.
for
example,
the
limitations
on
action
when
congress
gave
these
employers
two
years
within
which
to
sue
before
1947,
state
law
controlled
the
statute
of
limitations.
they
were
diversion
views
and
congress
found
in
1947
that
this
lack
of
uniformity
has
created
an
undesirable
situation
in
the
united
states.
they
therefore
set
a
two-year
federal
standard.
the
point
is
they
did
this
not
only
to
get
uniformity
but
because
they
believe
employees
might
not
generally
know
their
rights
under
the
act
and
needed
that
long
period
of
time
within
which
to
bring
their
suit.
suppose
we
accept
the
employer's
claim
in
this
case
that
employees
are
barred
from
court
because
they
did
not
invoke
grievance
procedures
when
they
were
available.
this
would
bring
about
even
greater
lack
of
uniformity
and
that's
precisely
what
congress
legislated
against
because
if
they
take
it
that
would
mean
that
when
the
grievance
process
was
available
they
would
be
bound
by
the
terms
of
the
grievance
process
which
may
set
its
own
time
limits
or
when
they
could
bring
the
grievance.
in
this
case,
except
to
(inaudible)
mr.
justice
white
you
asked
my
colleague
here
whether
there
is
no
any
limit
on
the
first
step.
as
i
read
the
contract
which
is
set
down
on
829,
the
appendix
says,
yes,
10
days.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
in
the
event
he
does
receive
a
satisfactory
answer
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
--
he
shall
within
10
days
of
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
well,
it
is
titled
step
one
in
the
contact
that
is
what
i
was
referring
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
no,
but
i
think
that
the
way
i
read
it,
it
says
he
shall
submit
within
10
days
of
knowledge
of
the
incident.
that
certainly
means
the
incident
he
is
complaining
about.
so
after
he
goes
to
his
employer
says
and
says,
look
you
are
doing
something
wrong
under
the
contract
then
within
10
days,
he
has
to
file
a
written
grievance.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes.
no,
i
do
not
write
that
out.
if
he
does
receive
a
satisfactory
answer,
of
course,
there
is
no
reason
for
him
to
file
a
written
grievance,
but
the
point
is
that
all
collective
bargaining
agreements
set
their
own
time
limits
and
that
is
precisely
the
contrary
what
congress
wanted.
they
wanted
a
uniform
standard
throughout
the
country
and
they
did
not
want
10
days
or
15
days,
or
a
year,
they
wanted
two
years.
so
further
indication,
i
think
this
is
quite
important
is
that
before
1947,
unions
could
bring
actions
on
behalf
of
their
own
employees.
but
in
1947,
congress
under
section
16
(b),
deleted
the
provision
allowing
representative
actions
so
that
now
16
(b)
reads
“that
only
the
employee
himself
controls
and
prosecutes
his
own
action.”
compare
that
to
the
grievance
process,
it
is
precisely
the
opposite
of
what
congress
said
because
in
the
grievance
process,
beyond
the
very
first
step
where
the
employee
steps
down
as
written
grievance
it
is
the
union
that
controls
prosecution
of
the
claims.
that
is
directly
contrary
to
a
congress
legislated
in
1947.
so
further
and
i
think
i
have
been
talking
about
this
already,
the
point
is
that
the
maximum
hours
provision
is
concerned
more
simply
than
we
ware
simply
helping
the
industry.
this
is
an
important
part
of
the
helping
the
individual
employee
bear
the
burden
of
having
to
worked
over
40
hours,
concerned
with
more
than
that,
because
one
of
the
reasons
that
congress
set
down
a
limit
on
maximum
hours
is
to
spread
employment
throughout
the
country
by
exerting
pressure
on
employee
--
employers
to
hire
more
people
rather
than
working
the
people
they
have
in
an
overtime.
also,
since
the
minimum
standards
apply
throughout
the
country.
they
have
to
be
applied
uniformly.
if
they
are
not,
one
employer
gains
an
advantage
over
his
competitors.
congress
could
not
possibly
have
thought
that
they
could
realize,
that
these
goals
could
be
realized
from
the
grievance
process
or
even
through
arbitration.
the
claims
are
settled
by
the
union
and
the
employer
along
the
way.
the
lack
of
uniformity
is
quite
obvious.
each
employer
in
each
industry
is
going
to
be
treated
differently
because
the
grievance
process
is
tailored
to
the
particular
problems
of
the
plant,
but
even
if
the
matter
reaches
arbitration,
arbitrators
are
not
necessarily
trained
in
the
law.
they
don't
necessarily
fall
to
stare
decisis.
they
do
not
have
to
give
reasons
for
their
opinions.
their
record
is
not
as
complete
as
in
a
judicial
trial.
there
is
very
limited
judicial
review
of
what
they
held
and
all
these
factors
are
quite
important
if
you
are
going
to
have
uniform
interpretation
of
what
is
in
fact
of
the
fourteenth
federal
enactment
that
applies
to
people
throughout
the
country.
in
addition,
finally,
congress
in
section
16
(c)
and
section
17
of
the
act
said
the
secretary
of
labor
can
enforce
it
even
when
the
employee
himself
is
unwilling
or
unable
to
bring
the
action.
now,
we
think
that
it
the
secretary
has
direct
access
to
the
court,
it
makes
little
sense
to
say
that
employees
don't,
that
they
have
to
go
though
the
grievance
process
where
secretary
can
bring
an
action
directly
in
court
and
that
the
employee
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
that
is
true,
the
secretary
has
to
enforce
--
the
secretary
is
not
(voice
overlap)
contract
right,
that
is
the
important
thing
and
neither
is
the
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
well,
first
of
all
this
is
purely
statutory.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
it
is
purely
statutory
claim.
the
contract
here
is
limited
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
well,
i
said
it
is
doubtful
at
best
whether
they
can
award
liquidated
damages.
the
employee
is
entitled
to
twice
--
to
twice
the
amount
of
the
damages
and
i
take
it
if
the
–-
suppose
the
contract
is
violated,
what
does
that
mean?
that
means
the
employer
owes
the
employee
for
the
amount
he
has
not
taken.
the
arbitrator
is
confined
to
the
contract
that
is
what
he
awards.
the
statute
does
no
say
that.
it
says,
we
think
the
employees
are
damaged
even
more
than
that
and
they
are
entitled
to
an
equal
amount.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
that
is
right.
in
this
case.
i
am
saying
in
general
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
no,
i
said,
i
would
assume
that.
i
did
not
admit
it.
i
said
i
will
assume
that
for
the
purposes
of
my
argument.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
then
i
say
it
is
doubtful
at
best
whether
the
arbitrator
is
going
to
award
the
liquidated
damages.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
no,
because
my
assumption
was
--
my
assumption
went
to
the
question
whether
the
arbitrator
can
determine
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act
whether
this
was
worth
and
i
assume
he
can,
but
i
am
talking
about
the
remedies
he
gives
after
he
makes
that
determination.
whether
they
are
governed
by
the
contract
or
not
is
doubtful
at
best
and
the
point
is
that
this
is
supposed
to
be
uniform
throughout
the
county
and
it
should
in
turn
what
the
contract
says.
moreover,
in
the
republic
steel
case,
this
court’s
decision
in
the
republic
steel
case
is
quite
distinguishable
from
here
because
republic
steel
dealt
only
with
the
question
of
contract
interpretation.
the
point
is
neither
congress
nor
this
court
has
ever
said
that
grievance
proceedings
in
the
labor
contract
is
a
preferred
method
of
vindicating
an
employees'
statutory
rights
independent
of
the
contract.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
you
may
continue
mr.
randolph.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
was
discussing
the
bulk
carrier’s
case
which
this
court
decided
last
term.
i
also
made
reference
to
the
mckinney
case
which
was
decided
in
1957
which
we
have
discussed
on
pages
24
to
25
of
our
brief.
in
both
of
these
cases,
this
court
held
that
when
congress
provided,
the
court
should
be
the
forum
for
enforcing
an
employees'
statutory
rights,
the
employee
was
entitled
to
direct
the
access
to
the
courts.
the
court
so
held
in
both
cases
even
though
the
contract
grievance
procedures
were
available
and
even
though
determination
of
the
employees'
statutory
rights
required
interpretation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
we
think
this
is
even
a
stronger
case
because
in
this
case,
they
said
at
the
outset,
the
employees'
claims
did
not
require
interpretation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
their
claims
under
the
act
of
overtime
compensation
are
derived
entirely
from
the
fair
labor
standards
act
and
we
think
this
case
is
also
stronger
than
bulk
carriers
and
mckinney
because
congress'
intent
to
afford
direct
access
to
the
courts
is
even
more
apparent
than
the
provisions
and
policies
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
and
it
was
with
the
respect
of
the
statutes
involved
in
mckinney
and
bulk
carriers.
over
the
three
decades,
that
have
passed
since
enactment
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
in
1938,
a
considerable
body
of
federal
law
has
developed
through
the
state
and
federal
court
decisions
construing
and
applying
the
act.
these
decisions
and
the
acts
provisions
and
legislative
history
together
with
administrative
determinations
must
be
considered
in
deciding
the
merits
of
every
case
that
arises
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
the
point
is
this
is
a
job
for
the
courts
and
the
not
arbitrators.
an
important
point
is
that
congress
made
it
a
job
for
the
courts
and
certainly
not
a
task
that
can
be
handled
through
bargaining
by
the
union
and
the
employer
in
grievance
proceeding,
particularly
since
employees’
rights,
the
minimum
wages,
and
overtime
compensation
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act
cannot
be
bargained
away.
for
these
reasons,
we
urge
the
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
iowa.
thank
you.
