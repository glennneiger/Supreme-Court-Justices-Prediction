mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
a
motion
in
this
case.
it
is
called
by
the
respondent
has
called
a
suggestion
of
the
writ
having
being
improvidently
granted
and
we
have
a
resistance
on
the
file
for
that.
as
i
understand
the
rule
of
the
court,
there
is
to
be
no
oral
argument
as
to
that
motion.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
on
the
merits,
if
i
may
at
the
outset,
i
would
like
to
present
very
briefly
the
three
central
points
that
petitioner
believes
are
critical
in
this
case.
one
is
that
the
case
invites
a
policy
decision
in
the
area
of
labor
management
relations
and
they
urge
that
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
republic
steel
against
maddox
governs
this
case.
number
two,
the
substantive
rights
involved
in
this
case,
as
in
maddox,
derives
simply
from
the
contract,
the
collective
bargain
agreement,
there
is
not
such
right
is
provided
for
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
third,
that
our
case
is
not
at
all
an
attack
on
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
our
contract
does
not
diminish
rights
under
the
act.
it
enlarges
rights.
now,
the
facts
here
are
quite
simple.
iowa
beef
was
and
is
engaged
in
the
processing
of
meat
and
the
shipment
of
meat
interstate
throughout
the
country.
the
14
respondents
who
bought
--
who
brought
14
separate
actions
in
this
case
were
employed
and
some
of
them
are
still
employed
by
iowa
beef
in
the
maintenance
and
repair
department
to
keep
the
machinery
in
operation
for
production.
they
worked
under
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
which
is
set
out
in
the
record.
the
agreement
provides,
among
other
things,
for
a
lunch
period.
the
respondents
argue
that
--
did
argue
in
the
court
below
and
that
was
sustained
by
the
courts
below
on
the
facts,
as
to
those
facts,
they
argued
that
because
the
machinery
broke
down
from
time
to
time,
they
were
called
upon
to
do
repair
work
during
their
lunch
time,
even
though
they
got
the
lunch
time
later
on
or
even
when
they
were
not
actually
called
upon,
that
they
were
subject
to
call
during
their
lunch
time,
in
case
there
was
a
breakdown,
for
those
reasons,
the
respondents
argued
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
by
the
petitioner
which
then
they
say
gave
rise
to
a
course
of
action
under
fair
labor
standards
act.
now,
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
also
provides
for
grievance
procedures
and
for
arbitration
in
three
or
four
steps.
instead
of
proceeding
through
the
grievance
procedures,
the
respondents
began
these
14
separate
actions
directly
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
the
iowa
court
sustained
them
on
the
merits
of
their
claim
and
we
do
not
challenge
that
here
while
we
do
not
agree
with
the
correctness
of
it.
but
we
did
challenge,
by
answer
and
by
motion,
the
point
that
these
respondents
should
have
applied
or
attempted
the
grievance
and
arbitration
provisions,
instead
of
proceeding
directly
to
court
action
of
the
fair
labor
standards
acts.
that
was
overruled
and
incidentally
on
the
record,
the
record
on
page
4
of
the
record
plainly
states
that
these
respondents
admitted
that
they
did
not
attempt
to
utilize
the
grievance
procedures.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
the
--
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
no,
your
honor.
the
union
or
the
employee,
the
individual
employee
or
the
union
could
initiate
the
grievance
procedures
and
could
--
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
not
directly,
no.
the
union
then
is
directed
to
undertake
the
further
steps?
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
not
entirely
on
his
own,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
no,
i
would
say
--
well,
it
might
but
it
would
not
terminate
the
employees’
rights.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
well,
vaca
against
sipes
of
course
requires
the
union
to
exercise
proper
diligence
and
so
forth.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
well,
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
that
is
right.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
but
--
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
but
in
this
case,
they
did
not
even
to
attempt
the
first
step,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
the
first
step
sir,
plaintiff
recites
i
believe
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
the
individual
employee
may
initiate
that
first
step.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
that
is
right.
these
employees
in
the
union
knew
that
effectiveness
of
these
of
these
grievance
procedures
because
as
the
record
show
--
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
that
is
right.
they
did
not
attempt
even
the
first
step.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
i
am
sorry.
i
do
not
hear
very
well.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
the
same
point
mr.
justice
was
made
in
the
maddox
case
and
that
this
court
summarily
overruled
that
--
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
well,
that
is
right.
that
was
three
years
after
this
case
was
began
and
it
was
a
long
after
the
case
had
been
decided
in
the
trial
courts
and
the
people
were
put
on
notice
here
by
our
answer
and
by
our
motion
that
they
were
required
to
utilize
grievance
procedures
and
did
not
even
attempt
to
do
so
even
then.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
well,
i
think
the
individual
still
has
the
right
to
initiate
grievance
procedure
and
i
would
think
your
honor
that
in
the
absence
of
a
union
there
would
be
no
rule
of
law.
no
court
would
bar
him
from
proceeding
on
his
own
towards
the
subsequent
steps
in
the
grievance
procedures
and
in
arbitration.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
well,
that
was
so
argued
in
the
maddox
case
and
maddox
overruled
that
to
point
your
honor
whereas
the
marilyn
(ph)
said
--
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
no
problem,
your
honor.
the
iowa
court
relayed
chiefly
on
the
arguelles
case
in
which
the
decision
opposed
to
on
our
point
about
attempting
grievance,
now,
these
14
separate
actions
were
started
in
1967,
five
years
ago
and
this
is
the
record
that
they
faced
in
beginning,
these
actions.
in
1947,
congress
enacted
the
labor
management
relations
act,
declaring
grievance
procedures
as
the
desirable
method
for
settling
wage
disputes
between
employer
or
an
employee.
ten
years
later,
lincoln
mills
ruled
that
grievance
procedures
were
enforceable
at
the
demand
of
the
union,
but
did
not
include
individual
employees
at
that
time.
in
1965,
this
court
ruled
in
maddox
that
the
individual
employees
were
eligible
then
and
could
enforce
grievance
procedures
and
arbitration.
thus
on
that
basis
that
we
present,
largely
present
our
case.
the
maddox
case
also
stressed
the
comprehensiveness
and
the
uniformity
of
law
desirable
under
the
congressional
mandate
and
the
policies
as
formulated
by
this
court.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
sovereign’s
pay,
your
honor
under
the
contract.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
yes
(voice
overlap)
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
the
mine
has
been
closed
there
and
there
was
no
foreman
and
maddox
said
that
therefore
there
was
no
way
to
attempt
the
grievance
procedure,
but
this
court
in
maddox
summarily
overruled
that
contention.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
that
is
right
and
we
say
here
that
also,
the
only
substantive
right
involved
here
is
lunch
period
and
the
violation
of
that
agreement
by
the
employer.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
that
is
over
40
hours
a
week.
our
contract
does
the
same,
your
honor
that
and
they
do
not
get
to
fair
labor
standards
act
status
under
facts
of
our
case
until
first
the
employer
has
violated
the
contract
right.
the
violation
of
that
contract
right,
not
to
any
violation
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
requirements,
the
violation
of
the
contract
right
then
may
trigger
remedial
rights
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
that
is
right
your
honor
and
the
--
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
that
is
--
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
no,
the
--
this
difference
show
mr.
justice
that
the
fair
labor
standards
act
does
not
require
the
granting
of
lunch
time.
we
could
have
provided
for
eight
hours
consecutive
work
without
lunch
time,
we
would
never
had
this
problem,
but
we
did
agree
to
give
lunch
time.
we
violated
that
agreement.
so
we
have
a
right
--
purely
a
contract
right
and
a
violation
of
that
contract
right
that
then
triggers
remedial
processes.
then
we
say
this
that
the
arbitrator
under
the
arbitration
requirements
and
under
the
decisions
is
bound
to
follow
the
law
so
that
the
arbitrator
would
have
to
apply
all
the
remedial
provisions
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
and
i
believe
that
mr.
justice
white
in
the
dissenting
opinion
--
in
the
opinion
for
four
justices
of
their
court
in
the
arguelles
case
emphasized
that
point.
the
arbitrator
could
apply
all
the
remedial
remedies
and
we
have
four
decisions
of
the
united
states
circuit
courts
of
appeal
in
fair
labor
standards
act
cases
which
they
said
that
arbitration
must
precede
any
court
action.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
well,
possibly
your
honor
under
the
maddox
decision,
there
was
just
a
reversal
of
the
case
below.
what
happens
after
that
i
do
not
know?
now,
what
would
happen
here
after
if
this
court
were
to
reverse,
i
do
not
know
either?
we
would
have
to
leave
that
to
the
development
of
the
circumstances
on
the
law.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
pardon?
i
did
not
hear
the
last.
i
am
sorry.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
no,
i
think
not.
there
are
time
--
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
yes.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
that
is
right
and
the
arbitrator;
he
will
be
required
to
apply
all
the
remedial
provisions
of
the
standards
act.
the
statute
limitation
provision,
the
penalty
provisions
for
liquidated
damages
and
cause
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
am
not
at
all
sure
this
case
involves
the
liquidated
damages
provision
because
there
were
no
liquidated
damages
allowed
by
the
court
below.
it
may
well
be
--
and
mr.
justice
harlan
in
his
special
concurrence
in
the
arguelles
case,
the
simmons
case
which
is
very
much
unlike
this
because
there
we
had
a
special
statute
in
which
the
distinctive
doctrines
that
had
been
applied
to
simmons,
traditionally
since
1790
by
the
congress
and
by
the
courts.
the
simmons
case
applied,
the
arguelles
case
applied
that
doctrine
to
that
very
special
statute
and
that
statute
made
no
provision
either
for
administrative
enforcement,
whereas
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
they
both
could
be
enforcement
as
shown
by
the
reports
of
the
administrator
himself
cited
in
one
of
the
footnotes
to
the
original
brief
in
this
case
indicates
that
very
few
actions
are
brought
by
employees
and
most
of
those
that
are
brought
by
employees
are
brought
by
employees
who
came
after
the
law
had
already
had
ceased
to
being
in
an
employee
of
the
employer.
so
that
mr.
justice
harlan
indicated
plainly
that
that
his
understanding
that
the
case
of
u.s.
bulk
carriers
against
arguelles
did
not
decide
simply
because
that
there
was
a
statute
that
that
made
all
the
difference.
the
point
was
to
examine
the
precise
nature
of
that
statute
and
see
then
which
of
the
policies,
arbitration
on
the
one
hand
or
direct
section
on
the
other
hand
of
the
statute
should
apply.
and
we
respectfully
submit
here
that
our
statute,
the
fair
labor
standards
act
statute
is
not
the
type
of
statute
that
would
come
within
the
sweep
of
the
simmons
case
in
the
--
under
the
arguelles'
doctrine.
quite
the
contrary,
we
have
indicated
in
our
brief
that
the
fair
labor
standards
act
is
not
unqualified
and
it
is
not
all
inclusive.
there
we
list
in
our
--
indicate
in
our
brief
at
least
37
exceptions
under
one
section
of
the
act
and
others
under
other
sections
so
that
it
is
not
the
policy
of
the
congress
to
make
that
act
exclusive.
and
the
four
cases
in
the
u.s.
courts
of
appeals
in
fair
labor
standards
acts
cases
indicate
very
plainly
that
two
things
are
i
think
relevant
here.
one
that
the
fair
labor
standards
act
does
not
require
a
court
action.
it
just
says
court
action
may
be
brought
and
secondly
that
the
arbitrators
are
bound
to
apply
the
law
by
all
provisions
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
in
reaching
a
decision
in
arbitration.
i
believe
that's
pointed
out
too
in
wilko
against
swan
and
mr.
justice
white
in
the
arguelles
case.
i
would
like
to
say
this
if
i
may,
your
honors,
that
the
briefs
of
the
respondent
on
the
merits,
on
the
brief
of
--
the
amicus
brief
were
delivered
to
us
only
one
of
them
seven
days,
the
other
one
only
five
working
days
before
this
day
of
argument
so
we
had
no
opportunity
to
file
a
reply
brief.
we
did
file
a
very
short
reply
brief
in
the
original
proceedings
for
a
writ
and
i
would
beg
record
if
i
may
to
regard
that
reply
brief
as
something
of
the
reply
to
the
briefs
here
on
the
merits.
now,
i
think
they
are
reasonably
adequate
for
that
purpose.
among
the
many
differences
between
the
statute
in
the
arguelles
case
and
the
statute
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act
are
these.
that
the
fair
labor
standards
act
makes
provisions
for
enforcement
largely
by
the
administrator
and
that
has
been
the
practice.
an
administrator
can
administratively
require
payment
of
wages
and
may
also
bring
court
actions
to
require
the
payment
of
wages
and
there
is
a
provision
for
injunction
by
the
administrator
and
also
for
criminal
proceedings.
i
do
hope
to
make
it
very
clear
to
the
court
that
no
steps,
not
even
the
first
step
was
taken
here
by
the
employees
to
use
grievance
procedures
and
the
respondents
have
admitted
on
the
record,
this
is
on
page
4
of
the
record
beginning
at
line
25,
they
have
expressly
admitted
that
no
steps
permitted
under
the
grievance
procedures
provided
by
those
agreements
were
taken
by
the
plaintiffs
below
or
the
respondents
here.
it
is
rather
--
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
i
think
none.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record,
your
honor.
the
brief
does
--
the
brief
by
respondent
does
argue
the
aribitrability
now,
but
that's
a
matter
of
law.
there
was
no
exception
taken
in
the
record
to
that.
the
respondent’s
brief
too
in
a
footnote
--
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
no,
your
honor,
there
is
nothing
here
to
rebut
the
requirement
for
using
the
grievance
procedures.
there
is
a
footnote
in
the
respondents
--
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
precisely,
the
thing
that
that
court
just
--
that
the
court
was
called
upon.
one,
did
the
contract
relied
for
a
lunch
period?
second,
was
that
lunch
period
actually
furnished,
was
there
a
violation
of
that
contract
right?
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
oh!
definitely,
i
think
the
entire
substantive
right
depends
on
the
contact.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
well,
i
guess
i
did
not
understand
the
full
part
of
the
question
then.
we
admit
that
advice
was
given
and
that
we
admit
so
far
as
the
record
goes
that
we
violated
that
right
which
is
a
substantive
contract
right?
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
the
overtime
under
the
contract
too,
your
honor.
the
contact
provided
for
overtime
not
only
after
40
hours,
but
also
after
eight
hours
in
one
day.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
oh!
yes,
your
honor.
so
that
the
violation
of
the
contract
right
automatically
under
the
contract
would
give
them
the
right
to
overtime
pay.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
no,
i
think
not.
these
employees
were
on
call
as
a
matter
of
fact.
there
is
no
denial
of
that
and
it
is
on
that
basis
that
the
court
below
ruled
that
we
violated
the
contract
and
did
not
pay
for
the
overtime
involved
in
eating.
even
though
a
lunch
time
was
provided,
later
in
the
day,
but
they
were
still
subject
to
call
there.
so
that
under
the
decisions,
currently,
we
did
not
furnish
lunch
time
and
we
should
pay
for
time
and
a
half
during
the
lunch
time
period
and
it
is
only
the
violation
of
that
contract
right
that
triggers
the
remedial
rights
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act
and
they
have
the
same
rights
under
the
contract
and
as
the
--
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
oh!
we
did
not
–
oh!
it
is
only
at
this
level
that
we
are
not
challenging
that
mr.
justice.
we
did
challenge
the
factual
matter
in
the
trial
court
and
in
the
supreme
court,
but
the
trial
court
ruled
against
us
--
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
precisely,
that
is
what
the
same
is
--
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
i
think
not
your
honor.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
we
presented
the
same
evidence
i
think
in
both
situations.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
no,
your
honor.
there
was
no
jury
trial
actually
in
this
case
either.
i
would
like
to
reserve
some
time
for
rebuttal
if
i
may.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
amicus
brief
relies
most
largely
for
its
position
on
the
brooklyn
savings
bank
case.
as
we
point
out
on
page
22
of
our
brief,
the
court
there
said
that
the
fair
labor
standards
act
was
designed
to
protect
certain
groups
of
the
population
from
substandard
wages
due
to
the
unequal
bargaining
power
as
between
employer
and
employee.
we
do
not
have
that
unequal
bargaining
power
here
and
that
is
the
reason
for
distinguishing
collective
bargaining
agreements.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
mr.
justice
white,
our
understanding
is
that
the
operation
of
the
law
is
just
the
other
way
that
under
the
opinion
in
maddox
and
in
the
opinions
in
the
steelworkers
cases,
the
rule
seems
to
be
as
we
understand
it,
laid
down
that
arbitration
does
apply
unless
there
is
an
express
exclusion
of
some
subject
matter
in
the
contract.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
i
think
that
very
point
was
mr.
justice
in
the
buckley
case
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
it
was
rejected
for
the
reason
that
that
becomes
just
a
matter
of
semantics.
the
basis
of
the
claim
there
as
here
was
a
violation
of
the
contract,
agreement
to
give
a
lunch
period
and
a
failure
to
give
it
because
of
the
on
call
provision.
now,
that
triggers
entry
into
the
remedial
provisions
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
but
it
does
not
provide
the
basic
right
and
that
was
argued
unsuccessfully
by
the
parties
in
the
buckley
case
and
decided
our
way.
generally
arbitrator
--
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
well,
possibly
the
same
remedy
that
maddox
had
or
that
the
parties
in
the
lockridge
case
had,
whatever
they
may
be,
that
would
have
to
be
determined
afterwards.
the
maddox,
simply
overruled
the
--
or
simply
reversed
the
case
and
left
it
there.
these
parties
had
notice
of
the
law
long
before
they
filed
their
lawsuit.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
it
may
not
be.
it
depends
on
what
may
have
developed,
but
anyway
they
chose
their
route
at
their
own
peril.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
well,
the
contract
per
se
i
think
terminated
by
its
terms,
but
i
think
the
absence
of
the
union
does
not
terminate
the
rights
under
the
contract
that
was
in
existence
during
the
time
that
these
people
are
talking
about.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
no,
i
understand
there
is
no
union
now,
your
honor
but
the
individuals
have
their
rights
under
the
express
terms
of
the
contract.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
a
motion
in
this
case.
it
is
called
by
the
respondent
has
called
a
suggestion
of
the
writ
having
being
improvidently
granted
and
we
have
a
resistance
on
the
file
for
that.
as
i
understand
the
rule
of
the
court,
there
is
to
be
no
oral
argument
as
to
that
motion.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
on
the
merits,
if
i
may
at
the
outset,
i
would
like
to
present
very
briefly
the
three
central
points
that
petitioner
believes
are
critical
in
this
case.
one
is
that
the
case
invites
a
policy
decision
in
the
area
of
labor
management
relations
and
they
urge
that
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
republic
steel
against
maddox
governs
this
case.
number
two,
the
substantive
rights
involved
in
this
case,
as
in
maddox,
derives
simply
from
the
contract,
the
collective
bargain
agreement,
there
is
not
such
right
is
provided
for
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
third,
that
our
case
is
not
at
all
an
attack
on
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
our
contract
does
not
diminish
rights
under
the
act.
it
enlarges
rights.
now,
the
facts
here
are
quite
simple.
iowa
beef
was
and
is
engaged
in
the
processing
of
meat
and
the
shipment
of
meat
interstate
throughout
the
country.
the
14
respondents
who
bought
--
who
brought
14
separate
actions
in
this
case
were
employed
and
some
of
them
are
still
employed
by
iowa
beef
in
the
maintenance
and
repair
department
to
keep
the
machinery
in
operation
for
production.
they
worked
under
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
which
is
set
out
in
the
record.
the
agreement
provides,
among
other
things,
for
a
lunch
period.
the
respondents
argue
that
--
did
argue
in
the
court
below
and
that
was
sustained
by
the
courts
below
on
the
facts,
as
to
those
facts,
they
argued
that
because
the
machinery
broke
down
from
time
to
time,
they
were
called
upon
to
do
repair
work
during
their
lunch
time,
even
though
they
got
the
lunch
time
later
on
or
even
when
they
were
not
actually
called
upon,
that
they
were
subject
to
call
during
their
lunch
time,
in
case
there
was
a
breakdown,
for
those
reasons,
the
respondents
argued
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
by
the
petitioner
which
then
they
say
gave
rise
to
a
course
of
action
under
fair
labor
standards
act.
now,
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
also
provides
for
grievance
procedures
and
for
arbitration
in
three
or
four
steps.
instead
of
proceeding
through
the
grievance
procedures,
the
respondents
began
these
14
separate
actions
directly
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
the
iowa
court
sustained
them
on
the
merits
of
their
claim
and
we
do
not
challenge
that
here
while
we
do
not
agree
with
the
correctness
of
it.
but
we
did
challenge,
by
answer
and
by
motion,
the
point
that
these
respondents
should
have
applied
or
attempted
the
grievance
and
arbitration
provisions,
instead
of
proceeding
directly
to
court
action
of
the
fair
labor
standards
acts.
that
was
overruled
and
incidentally
on
the
record,
the
record
on
page
4
of
the
record
plainly
states
that
these
respondents
admitted
that
they
did
not
attempt
to
utilize
the
grievance
procedures.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
the
--
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
no,
your
honor.
the
union
or
the
employee,
the
individual
employee
or
the
union
could
initiate
the
grievance
procedures
and
could
--
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
not
directly,
no.
the
union
then
is
directed
to
undertake
the
further
steps?
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
not
entirely
on
his
own,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
no,
i
would
say
--
well,
it
might
but
it
would
not
terminate
the
employees’
rights.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
well,
vaca
against
sipes
of
course
requires
the
union
to
exercise
proper
diligence
and
so
forth.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
well,
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
that
is
right.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
but
--
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
but
in
this
case,
they
did
not
even
to
attempt
the
first
step,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
the
first
step
sir,
plaintiff
recites
i
believe
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
the
individual
employee
may
initiate
that
first
step.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
that
is
right.
these
employees
in
the
union
knew
that
effectiveness
of
these
of
these
grievance
procedures
because
as
the
record
show
--
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
that
is
right.
they
did
not
attempt
even
the
first
step.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
i
am
sorry.
i
do
not
hear
very
well.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
the
same
point
mr.
justice
was
made
in
the
maddox
case
and
that
this
court
summarily
overruled
that
--
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
well,
that
is
right.
that
was
three
years
after
this
case
was
began
and
it
was
a
long
after
the
case
had
been
decided
in
the
trial
courts
and
the
people
were
put
on
notice
here
by
our
answer
and
by
our
motion
that
they
were
required
to
utilize
grievance
procedures
and
did
not
even
attempt
to
do
so
even
then.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
well,
i
think
the
individual
still
has
the
right
to
initiate
grievance
procedure
and
i
would
think
your
honor
that
in
the
absence
of
a
union
there
would
be
no
rule
of
law.
no
court
would
bar
him
from
proceeding
on
his
own
towards
the
subsequent
steps
in
the
grievance
procedures
and
in
arbitration.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
well,
that
was
so
argued
in
the
maddox
case
and
maddox
overruled
that
to
point
your
honor
whereas
the
marilyn
(ph)
said
--
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
no
problem,
your
honor.
the
iowa
court
relayed
chiefly
on
the
arguelles
case
in
which
the
decision
opposed
to
on
our
point
about
attempting
grievance,
now,
these
14
separate
actions
were
started
in
1967,
five
years
ago
and
this
is
the
record
that
they
faced
in
beginning,
these
actions.
in
1947,
congress
enacted
the
labor
management
relations
act,
declaring
grievance
procedures
as
the
desirable
method
for
settling
wage
disputes
between
employer
or
an
employee.
ten
years
later,
lincoln
mills
ruled
that
grievance
procedures
were
enforceable
at
the
demand
of
the
union,
but
did
not
include
individual
employees
at
that
time.
in
1965,
this
court
ruled
in
maddox
that
the
individual
employees
were
eligible
then
and
could
enforce
grievance
procedures
and
arbitration.
thus
on
that
basis
that
we
present,
largely
present
our
case.
the
maddox
case
also
stressed
the
comprehensiveness
and
the
uniformity
of
law
desirable
under
the
congressional
mandate
and
the
policies
as
formulated
by
this
court.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
sovereign’s
pay,
your
honor
under
the
contract.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
yes
(voice
overlap)
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
the
mine
has
been
closed
there
and
there
was
no
foreman
and
maddox
said
that
therefore
there
was
no
way
to
attempt
the
grievance
procedure,
but
this
court
in
maddox
summarily
overruled
that
contention.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
that
is
right
and
we
say
here
that
also,
the
only
substantive
right
involved
here
is
lunch
period
and
the
violation
of
that
agreement
by
the
employer.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
that
is
over
40
hours
a
week.
our
contract
does
the
same,
your
honor
that
and
they
do
not
get
to
fair
labor
standards
act
status
under
facts
of
our
case
until
first
the
employer
has
violated
the
contract
right.
the
violation
of
that
contract
right,
not
to
any
violation
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
requirements,
the
violation
of
the
contract
right
then
may
trigger
remedial
rights
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
that
is
right
your
honor
and
the
--
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
that
is
--
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
no,
the
--
this
difference
show
mr.
justice
that
the
fair
labor
standards
act
does
not
require
the
granting
of
lunch
time.
we
could
have
provided
for
eight
hours
consecutive
work
without
lunch
time,
we
would
never
had
this
problem,
but
we
did
agree
to
give
lunch
time.
we
violated
that
agreement.
so
we
have
a
right
--
purely
a
contract
right
and
a
violation
of
that
contract
right
that
then
triggers
remedial
processes.
then
we
say
this
that
the
arbitrator
under
the
arbitration
requirements
and
under
the
decisions
is
bound
to
follow
the
law
so
that
the
arbitrator
would
have
to
apply
all
the
remedial
provisions
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
and
i
believe
that
mr.
justice
white
in
the
dissenting
opinion
--
in
the
opinion
for
four
justices
of
their
court
in
the
arguelles
case
emphasized
that
point.
the
arbitrator
could
apply
all
the
remedial
remedies
and
we
have
four
decisions
of
the
united
states
circuit
courts
of
appeal
in
fair
labor
standards
act
cases
which
they
said
that
arbitration
must
precede
any
court
action.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
well,
possibly
your
honor
under
the
maddox
decision,
there
was
just
a
reversal
of
the
case
below.
what
happens
after
that
i
do
not
know?
now,
what
would
happen
here
after
if
this
court
were
to
reverse,
i
do
not
know
either?
we
would
have
to
leave
that
to
the
development
of
the
circumstances
on
the
law.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
pardon?
i
did
not
hear
the
last.
i
am
sorry.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
no,
i
think
not.
there
are
time
--
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
yes.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
that
is
right
and
the
arbitrator;
he
will
be
required
to
apply
all
the
remedial
provisions
of
the
standards
act.
the
statute
limitation
provision,
the
penalty
provisions
for
liquidated
damages
and
cause
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
am
not
at
all
sure
this
case
involves
the
liquidated
damages
provision
because
there
were
no
liquidated
damages
allowed
by
the
court
below.
it
may
well
be
--
and
mr.
justice
harlan
in
his
special
concurrence
in
the
arguelles
case,
the
simmons
case
which
is
very
much
unlike
this
because
there
we
had
a
special
statute
in
which
the
distinctive
doctrines
that
had
been
applied
to
simmons,
traditionally
since
1790
by
the
congress
and
by
the
courts.
the
simmons
case
applied,
the
arguelles
case
applied
that
doctrine
to
that
very
special
statute
and
that
statute
made
no
provision
either
for
administrative
enforcement,
whereas
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
they
both
could
be
enforcement
as
shown
by
the
reports
of
the
administrator
himself
cited
in
one
of
the
footnotes
to
the
original
brief
in
this
case
indicates
that
very
few
actions
are
brought
by
employees
and
most
of
those
that
are
brought
by
employees
are
brought
by
employees
who
came
after
the
law
had
already
had
ceased
to
being
in
an
employee
of
the
employer.
so
that
mr.
justice
harlan
indicated
plainly
that
that
his
understanding
that
the
case
of
u.s.
bulk
carriers
against
arguelles
did
not
decide
simply
because
that
there
was
a
statute
that
that
made
all
the
difference.
the
point
was
to
examine
the
precise
nature
of
that
statute
and
see
then
which
of
the
policies,
arbitration
on
the
one
hand
or
direct
section
on
the
other
hand
of
the
statute
should
apply.
and
we
respectfully
submit
here
that
our
statute,
the
fair
labor
standards
act
statute
is
not
the
type
of
statute
that
would
come
within
the
sweep
of
the
simmons
case
in
the
--
under
the
arguelles'
doctrine.
quite
the
contrary,
we
have
indicated
in
our
brief
that
the
fair
labor
standards
act
is
not
unqualified
and
it
is
not
all
inclusive.
there
we
list
in
our
--
indicate
in
our
brief
at
least
37
exceptions
under
one
section
of
the
act
and
others
under
other
sections
so
that
it
is
not
the
policy
of
the
congress
to
make
that
act
exclusive.
and
the
four
cases
in
the
u.s.
courts
of
appeals
in
fair
labor
standards
acts
cases
indicate
very
plainly
that
two
things
are
i
think
relevant
here.
one
that
the
fair
labor
standards
act
does
not
require
a
court
action.
it
just
says
court
action
may
be
brought
and
secondly
that
the
arbitrators
are
bound
to
apply
the
law
by
all
provisions
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
in
reaching
a
decision
in
arbitration.
i
believe
that's
pointed
out
too
in
wilko
against
swan
and
mr.
justice
white
in
the
arguelles
case.
i
would
like
to
say
this
if
i
may,
your
honors,
that
the
briefs
of
the
respondent
on
the
merits,
on
the
brief
of
--
the
amicus
brief
were
delivered
to
us
only
one
of
them
seven
days,
the
other
one
only
five
working
days
before
this
day
of
argument
so
we
had
no
opportunity
to
file
a
reply
brief.
we
did
file
a
very
short
reply
brief
in
the
original
proceedings
for
a
writ
and
i
would
beg
record
if
i
may
to
regard
that
reply
brief
as
something
of
the
reply
to
the
briefs
here
on
the
merits.
now,
i
think
they
are
reasonably
adequate
for
that
purpose.
among
the
many
differences
between
the
statute
in
the
arguelles
case
and
the
statute
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act
are
these.
that
the
fair
labor
standards
act
makes
provisions
for
enforcement
largely
by
the
administrator
and
that
has
been
the
practice.
an
administrator
can
administratively
require
payment
of
wages
and
may
also
bring
court
actions
to
require
the
payment
of
wages
and
there
is
a
provision
for
injunction
by
the
administrator
and
also
for
criminal
proceedings.
i
do
hope
to
make
it
very
clear
to
the
court
that
no
steps,
not
even
the
first
step
was
taken
here
by
the
employees
to
use
grievance
procedures
and
the
respondents
have
admitted
on
the
record,
this
is
on
page
4
of
the
record
beginning
at
line
25,
they
have
expressly
admitted
that
no
steps
permitted
under
the
grievance
procedures
provided
by
those
agreements
were
taken
by
the
plaintiffs
below
or
the
respondents
here.
it
is
rather
--
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
i
think
none.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record,
your
honor.
the
brief
does
--
the
brief
by
respondent
does
argue
the
aribitrability
now,
but
that's
a
matter
of
law.
there
was
no
exception
taken
in
the
record
to
that.
the
respondent’s
brief
too
in
a
footnote
--
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
no,
your
honor,
there
is
nothing
here
to
rebut
the
requirement
for
using
the
grievance
procedures.
there
is
a
footnote
in
the
respondents
--
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
precisely,
the
thing
that
that
court
just
--
that
the
court
was
called
upon.
one,
did
the
contract
relied
for
a
lunch
period?
second,
was
that
lunch
period
actually
furnished,
was
there
a
violation
of
that
contract
right?
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
oh!
definitely,
i
think
the
entire
substantive
right
depends
on
the
contact.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
well,
i
guess
i
did
not
understand
the
full
part
of
the
question
then.
we
admit
that
advice
was
given
and
that
we
admit
so
far
as
the
record
goes
that
we
violated
that
right
which
is
a
substantive
contract
right?
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
the
overtime
under
the
contract
too,
your
honor.
the
contact
provided
for
overtime
not
only
after
40
hours,
but
also
after
eight
hours
in
one
day.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
oh!
yes,
your
honor.
so
that
the
violation
of
the
contract
right
automatically
under
the
contract
would
give
them
the
right
to
overtime
pay.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
no,
i
think
not.
these
employees
were
on
call
as
a
matter
of
fact.
there
is
no
denial
of
that
and
it
is
on
that
basis
that
the
court
below
ruled
that
we
violated
the
contract
and
did
not
pay
for
the
overtime
involved
in
eating.
even
though
a
lunch
time
was
provided,
later
in
the
day,
but
they
were
still
subject
to
call
there.
so
that
under
the
decisions,
currently,
we
did
not
furnish
lunch
time
and
we
should
pay
for
time
and
a
half
during
the
lunch
time
period
and
it
is
only
the
violation
of
that
contract
right
that
triggers
the
remedial
rights
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act
and
they
have
the
same
rights
under
the
contract
and
as
the
--
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
oh!
we
did
not
–
oh!
it
is
only
at
this
level
that
we
are
not
challenging
that
mr.
justice.
we
did
challenge
the
factual
matter
in
the
trial
court
and
in
the
supreme
court,
but
the
trial
court
ruled
against
us
--
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
precisely,
that
is
what
the
same
is
--
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
i
think
not
your
honor.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
we
presented
the
same
evidence
i
think
in
both
situations.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
no,
your
honor.
there
was
no
jury
trial
actually
in
this
case
either.
i
would
like
to
reserve
some
time
for
rebuttal
if
i
may.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
amicus
brief
relies
most
largely
for
its
position
on
the
brooklyn
savings
bank
case.
as
we
point
out
on
page
22
of
our
brief,
the
court
there
said
that
the
fair
labor
standards
act
was
designed
to
protect
certain
groups
of
the
population
from
substandard
wages
due
to
the
unequal
bargaining
power
as
between
employer
and
employee.
we
do
not
have
that
unequal
bargaining
power
here
and
that
is
the
reason
for
distinguishing
collective
bargaining
agreements.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
mr.
justice
white,
our
understanding
is
that
the
operation
of
the
law
is
just
the
other
way
that
under
the
opinion
in
maddox
and
in
the
opinions
in
the
steelworkers
cases,
the
rule
seems
to
be
as
we
understand
it,
laid
down
that
arbitration
does
apply
unless
there
is
an
express
exclusion
of
some
subject
matter
in
the
contract.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
i
think
that
very
point
was
mr.
justice
in
the
buckley
case
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
it
was
rejected
for
the
reason
that
that
becomes
just
a
matter
of
semantics.
the
basis
of
the
claim
there
as
here
was
a
violation
of
the
contract,
agreement
to
give
a
lunch
period
and
a
failure
to
give
it
because
of
the
on
call
provision.
now,
that
triggers
entry
into
the
remedial
provisions
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
but
it
does
not
provide
the
basic
right
and
that
was
argued
unsuccessfully
by
the
parties
in
the
buckley
case
and
decided
our
way.
generally
arbitrator
--
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
well,
possibly
the
same
remedy
that
maddox
had
or
that
the
parties
in
the
lockridge
case
had,
whatever
they
may
be,
that
would
have
to
be
determined
afterwards.
the
maddox,
simply
overruled
the
--
or
simply
reversed
the
case
and
left
it
there.
these
parties
had
notice
of
the
law
long
before
they
filed
their
lawsuit.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
it
may
not
be.
it
depends
on
what
may
have
developed,
but
anyway
they
chose
their
route
at
their
own
peril.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
well,
the
contract
per
se
i
think
terminated
by
its
terms,
but
i
think
the
absence
of
the
union
does
not
terminate
the
rights
under
the
contract
that
was
in
existence
during
the
time
that
these
people
are
talking
about.
mr.
louis
s.
goldberg
no,
i
understand
there
is
no
union
now,
your
honor
but
the
individuals
have
their
rights
under
the
express
terms
of
the
contract.
