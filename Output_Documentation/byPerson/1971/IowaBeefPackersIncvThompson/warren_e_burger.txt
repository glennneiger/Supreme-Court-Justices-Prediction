chief

e.
burger
in
this
case,
in
this
case
mr.
goldberg,
suppose
you
were
to
prevail
than
the
employees
would
have
to
go
back
under
a
grievance
procedure
under
the
contract,
is
that
right
or
could
they
go
directly
into
arbitration?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
claim
any
practice
or
custom
in
this
industry
that
employees
should
be
on
call
during
their
lunch
hour?
chief

mr.

chief

but
it
is
a
straight
--
from
your
point
of
view,
it
is
a
straight
excess
of
eight
hours
and
40
hours,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
forty
hours?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
congress
put
any
limitations
on
the
right
of
these
men,
these
claimants
to
settle
their
claim
directly
with
the
employer
after
it
had
been
asserted
either
before
or
after
the
pendency
of
the
lawsuit?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let
us
assume
that
they
go
by
stipulation
for
judgment;
do
you
think
your
position
puts
any
barriers
in
the
way
of
having
these
matters
disposed
of
without
litigation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
certainly
would
agree
that
it
is
better
that
these
cases
be
settled
rather
than
tried?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
talking
about
the
compliance
now,
that
means
giving
a
hundred
cents
on
the
dollar
of
the
total
claim.
i
am
talking
about
compromised
settlement.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
there
is
anyone
--
the
government
or
anyone
has
any
interest
in
putting
barriers
in
the
way
of
compromised
settlements
of
small
claims?
