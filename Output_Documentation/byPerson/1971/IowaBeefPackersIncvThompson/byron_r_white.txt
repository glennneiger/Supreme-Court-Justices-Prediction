justice

now
let
us
assume
in
the
ordinary
situation
under
this
contract
that
grievance
and
trial
or
that
an
employee
has
a
grievance?
were
the
grievance
procedures
and
the
arbitration
provisions
open
to
use
by
an
employee
alone?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
did
the
union
have
to
energize
the
process?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
an
individual
employee
if
he
was
turned
down
the
--
turned
down
by
the
employer
in
the
initial
steps
request
arbitration?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
employee
could
initiate
a
grievance
procedure,
but
he
could
not
take
it
to
arbitration?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
not
entirely.
if
the
union
said
no
arbitration,
that
was
the
end
of
the
process,
was
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
would
not
terminate
his
rights,
but
it
would
terminate
his
rights
to
arbitrate?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know,
but
vaca
against
sipes
also
said
that
every
time
a
union
refuses,
it
does
not
mean
that
it
is
wrong?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
let
us
assume
that
a
union
at
the
end
of
the
grievance
procedure
refuses
to
take
the
case
to
arbitration?
now,
the
employee
i
suppose
is
then
exhausted,
he
had
the
contract
rights,
has
he
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
could
go
to
court
under
301?
justice
byron
r.
white
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
did
not
even
attempt
to
take
it
to
grievance?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
let
us
assume
that
he
had
and
is
he
entitled
to
represent
himself
or
is
the
union
entitled
to
be
there
at
the
grievance
procedure?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
first
step
of
the
grievance
procedure
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
first
step
of
the
grievance
procedure
provided
for
in
the
contract,
sets
a
time
limit
on
discussing
the
matter
with
foreman
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
after
that?
after
that
there
are
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
only
in
future
step?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
if
you
admitted
the
right
and
the
violation
of
the
right,
why
did
you
not
just
pay
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
you
would
have
–-
you
would
have
wanted
to
present
the
arbitrator
your
opposition
to
the
claim?
you
would
have
wanted
to
say
that
you
did
not
violate
the
right.
so
there
was
not
a
right
that
you
did
not
violate
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
want
the
arbitrator
rather
than
the
court
to
determine
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
--
does
the
government
challenge
the
aribitrability
of
the
matter
into
the
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
arbitration
clause
is
brought
not
to
include
the
claim
on
the
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act
(voice
overlap)?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
what
is
the
reason
for
not
limiting
the
matter
to
arbitration
in
the
government
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
would
not
necessarily
prevent
remission
to
arbitration?
it
is
like
the
nlrb
deferring
to
arbitration
and
that
is
done
by
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
might
avoid
the
lawsuit
at
all
if
it
went
to
arbitration
and
get
everything
they
wanted?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
you
are
after
is
the
assertion
that
collective
bargaining
contract
itself
did
not
specifically
give
the
arbitrator
the
power
to
hear
a
statutory
as
compared
with
a
contractual
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
provision
says
that
arbitration
is
limited
to
the
construction
and
application
of
the
contract
and
if
a
claim
is
asserted
based
on
the
statute,
independent
of
any
contract
what
business
does
the
arbitrator
got?
