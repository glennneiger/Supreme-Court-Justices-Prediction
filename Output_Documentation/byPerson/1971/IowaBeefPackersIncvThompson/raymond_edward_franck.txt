mr.
raymond
edward
franck
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
the
attorney
representing
the
respondents
in
this
case.
we
are
in
full
agreement
with
the
law
as
expressed
by
the
government
as
a
general
law,
but
we
must
return
to
the
fact
of
the
instant
case
to
determine
just
what
the
rights
of
the
respondents
were.
if
we
will
refer
to
the
contract,
which
was
entered
into
by
the
union
and
the
management,
the
first
thing
we
must
realize
that
this
is
not
a
contract
in
any
way,
like
a
contract
in
bulk
carriers.
the
contract
in
bulk
carriers
provided
something
to
the
effect
that
the
arbitrators
had
the
power
to
settle
any
and
all
disputes
between
the
employees
and
the
employer.
we
must
return
to
the
individual
contract
in
this
case.
in
the
steelworker
cases
and
especially
the
wheel
case
and
also
in
the
warrior
gulf
case,
the
court
held
that
the
arbitrators
power
came
from
the
contract.
that
is
why
we
must
refer
to
this
individual
contract
that
i
have
before
me
which
is
set
out
in
the
appendix.
the
first
thing
it
does,
it
defines
by
its
terms
what
a
grievance
is.
a
grievance
pertains
to
the
violation
of
the
agreement.
no
reference
to
any
and
all
problems
between
employer
and
employee.
no
reference
to
any
federal
statutes,
just
a
direct
reference
to
this
contract.
secondly,
in
section
2
on
page
30,
the
power
of
the
arbitrator
is
specifically
set
out.
his
decision
in
the
grievance
shall
be
final
and
binding
on
the
party,
provided
he
shall
not
have
authority
other
than
to
apply
the
terms
and
conditions
specifically
set
forth
in
this
contract.
so
let
us
refer
back
to
our
instant
case
again.
at
no
point,
did
any
of
the
14
respondents
complained
that
they
did
not
get
a
meal
break,
no
place
in
their
petition,
no
place
in
their
reply,
no
place
in
the
trial
or
lawsuit.
the
respondents
admit,
they
got
their
meal
break.
under
the
facts
in
this
case,
the
contract
provides
that
they
are
entitled
to
a
meal
break.
it
does
not
provide
the
length
of
the
meal
break
whether
it
is
five
minutes
or
whether
it
is
an
hour.
now,
there
isn't
any
question
that
the
employees
got
their
meal
break.
under
the
facts
in
this
case,
they
say
five
hours
after
they
reported
for
work.
they
were
on
their
meal
break
in
a
special
cafeteria
set
aside,
not
the
general
cafeteria
where
the
other
labors
were,
but
only
the
maintenance
men
were
permitted
to
use
this
special
cafeteria.
when
the
bell
rang
for
a
breakdown,
if
that
was
doing
their
lunch
period,
they
left
their
lunch
period,
fixed
the
breach
and
came
back
and
they
were
given
their
lunch
break.
so
we
are
not
complaining
abut
the
fact
that
we
did
not
get
a
lunch
break.
what
we
are
complaining
about
is
the
fact
that
we
never
got
paid
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act
for
the
on
call
time.
mr.
raymond
edward
franck
yes?
mr.
raymond
edward
franck
yes,
i
would
but
i
do
not
agree
with
the
supreme
court
of
iowa.
i
think
we
got
to
consider
that
this
is
a
different
case,
a
much
stronger
case
than
either
the
mckinney
case
versus
the
railroad
or
republic
steel
or
even
the
case
of
bulk
carriers.
when
we
look
at
the
mckinney
case,
we
have
a
remedy
based
upon
a
contact.
the
same
is
true
in
bulk
carriers.
when
we
go
to
the
case
of
republic
steel,
we
there
have
a
contract
right.
but
here
we
have
a
statutory
right
and
a
statutory
remedy
which
the
respondents
went
into
the
court
and
requested
it'd
be
enforced
against
the
employer.
now
insofar
as
they
will
admit
and
they
do
admit
in
their
brief
that
before
you
can
come
under
the
terms
of
hours
work
which
is
article
7
of
the
contract,
you
must
first
establish
whether
or
not
the
meal
times
were
subject
to
be
paid
because
they
were
on
call.
there
is
nothing
in
this
contract
about
on
call
and
then
if
we
proceed
to
the
next
step,
it
seems
apparent
to
me
that
the
government
intended
that
the
fair
labor
standard
act
should
be
treated
differently
than
other
union
regulations
because
of
this
two-year
statute
of
limitation.
now,
it
appears
to
me
that
the
union
fails
in
this
and
they
take
over
the
matter
and
they
do
not
comply
with
their
statute
limitation
which
says
in
the
event
he
does
not
receive
a
satisfactory
answer
he
shall
within
ten
days
of
the
knowledge
of
the
incident.
not
of
the
discussion
with
his
employer,
within
knowledge
of
the
incident
he
is
barred
unless
he
starts
his
grievance
procedure.
this
is
going
to
create
a
tremendous
hardship
on
the
employees
who
are
represented
by
a
union
and
give
a
great
advantage
to
a
person
who
works
on
a
non-union
job.
for
this
reason,
under
the
act,
it
provides
the
portal-to-portal
act
and
the
fair
labor
standards
act
that
number
one,
each
work
week
is
a
separate
incident
or
a
separate
cause
of
action.
now,
if
we
proceed
then
to
the
portal-to-portal
act
where
we
have
the
two-year
statute
limitation
and
a
recent
amendment
to
three
years,
we
find
that
we
are
penalizing
someone
who
is
working
in
a
union
job,
taking
away
rights
that
a
man
in
a
non-union
job
would
have.
and
for
this
reason
we
feel
that
these
people
should
be
permitted;
number
one,
irregardless
of
any
other
rule.
that
maddox
does
not
apply
here
because
we
do
not
have
the
type
of
contract
that
would
permit
arbitration
by
a
fair
return.
secondly,
in
the
bulk
carrier’s
case
and
the
dissent
therein
does
not
apply
because
bulk
carriers
have
this
very
wide
contractual
agreement
which
said
in
effect
we
are
going
to
let
arbitrators
settle
any
problem
between
an
employer
and
an
employee.
now,
if
the
court
should
decide
that
this
was
true
in
this
case,
then
there
would
not
be
any
reason
why
you
could
not
require
a
man
who
was
hurt
in
the
plant
under
a
state
law
to
arbitrate
workman’s
compensation,
that
is
the
statutory
right.
so
i
feel
that
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
should
be
affirmed.
that
there
is
not
any
statutory
or
congressional
intent
which
would
obviate
that
reason.
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
the
union
contract
is
not
in
existence.
the
union
itself
is
not
in
existence.
there
is
no
way
for
these
people
to
obtain
a
remedy
unless
the
basis
of
this
and
insofar
as
the
facts
of
this
case,
in
1966,
one
year
prior
to
the
time
of
the
filing
of
these
suits
an
attempted
grievance
was
filed.
it
never
went
beyond
any
formal
situation.
the
record
is
not
clear
as
whether
payment
was
made
or
whether
it
was
not
made,
there
are
statements
on
both
sides.
however,
we
must
remember
that
that
was
a
grievance
according
to
the
record
on
a
failure
to
have
a
lunch
period,
not
an
on
call
lunch
period
and
to
show
the
problems
that
arose
after
these
suits
were
filed,
and
a
letter
was
sent
out
from
the
company
which
is
a
part
of
the
record,
instructing
these
people
to
use
their
grievance
procedure
and
not
to
answer
the
bell
if
it
rang.
when
they
refused
to
answer
the
bell,
the
foreman
said
to
them,
well,
you
answer
to
that
bell,
do
not
pay
any
attention
to
what
those
people
say
upstairs,
they
do
not
know
what
is
going
on
down
here.
so
i
think
that
any
attempt
to
make
them
do
this
would
have
been
futile.
so
therefore
i
respectfully
urge
the
court
to
affirm
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
iowa.
