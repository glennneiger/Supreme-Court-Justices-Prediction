unknown
speaker
just
to
make
it
sure
i
understand
your
last
point,
your
position
is
that
the
state
of
hawaii
could
not
sue
for
an
injunction
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
and
you
agree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
and
what
are
the
(inaudible)
to
prevent
a
irreparable
injury?
unknown
speaker
what
kind
of
injury
would
the
defendant,
georgia
take?
unknown
speaker
what
types
of
injury
to
its
economy
or
its
citizens?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
kind
of
an
injury
is
that?
unknown
speaker
and
how
would
that
be
manifested?
what
would
be
a
symptom
of
it?
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
individual
industries
and
the
citizen?
unknown
speaker
and,
or
you
have
just
to
walk
up
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
and
you
would
agree
that
the
state
is
getting
an
injunction.
unknown
speaker
what
if
you
were
wrong
about
that?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
--
the
court
pointed
the
essential
--
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
at
one
point
the
state
can
get
an
injunction
in
this
case
because
there
is
some
kind
of
an
injury
that
you
want
to
prevent
irreparable
--
unknown
speaker
well,
you
still
have
to
be
praying
if
there
is
some
injury
to
the
state.
unknown
speaker
to
get
an
injunction.
unknown
speaker
but
just
assuming
the
state
does
have
standing
and
it
has
the
legal
right
to
an
injunction
would
it
issue
the
state
--
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
but
--
let
us
not
assume
that
it
can
get
an
injunction
and
its
parens
patriae
--
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that
but
--
unknown
speaker
but
that
--
if
the
state
can
get
an
injunction
here
i
assume
you
are
saying
the
court,
some
court
would
be
saying
that
at
least
they
would
be
saying
that
there
is
an
injury
in
the
state
which
the
injunction
must
issue
to
prevent
--
.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
let
us
assume
that
you
are
wrong.
unknown
speaker
because
even
though
the
state
is
injured
as
a
state
and
its
economy
or
is
somehow
--
you
just
cannot
measure
it.
unknown
speaker
but
the
court
below
did
not
decide
it
on
the
--
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
measurable.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
federal
--
that
congress
had
given
these
state
standing
to
sue
on
behalf
of
its
citizens
to
recover
treble
damages?
unknown
speaker
and
there
would
be
a
ground
of
facts
--
grounds
for
a
future
controversy?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
for
his
separate
injury?
unknown
speaker
but
you
would
still
the
bar
the
citizen’s
suit.
unknown
speaker
what
about
you
said
you
were.
unknown
speaker
so
you
would
review
--
if
the
state
kept
the
money
on
its
treasury
the
citizens
should
be
able
to
sue
for
its
own
injury?
unknown
speaker
alright,
thank
you,
thank
you
for
it

just
