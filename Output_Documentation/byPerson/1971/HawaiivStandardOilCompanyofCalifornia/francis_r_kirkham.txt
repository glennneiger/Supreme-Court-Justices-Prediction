mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
view
of
the
remarks
of
mr.
blecher,
i
think
it
might
be
helpful
to
clarify
what
is
before
this
court
and
what
is
not.
he
referred
to
recovery
of
the
amounts
suffered
by
these
damages,
suffered
by
the
citizens
of
hawaii.
in
the
third
amended
complaint
in
this
case,
hawaii
pleaded
first
the
cause
of
action
for
damages
to
which
business
and
property,
its
proprietor.
and
second,
a
cause
of
action
for
damages
suffered
by
its
citizens.
on
the
authority
of
an
unbroken
line
of
decisions
by
this
court,
judge
pence
dismissed
that
count,
as
have
the
other
judges
who
considered
it
below
except
for
one.
holding
at
the
state
of
hawaii
had
no
standing
as
parens
patriae
(inaudible)
recover
for
the
injuries
to
its
citizens.
thereupon,
hawaii
filed
a
fourth
amended
complaint
with
a
totally
different
cause
of
action.
and
this
time,
it
asserted
as
its
parens
patriae,
a
claim
for
damages
sustained
by
it
as
distinguished
from
its
citizens.
but
a
claim,
in
addition,
to
its
injury
to
business
and
property
provided
by
section
4,
of
the
clayton
act,
namely
a
claim
for
injury
to
its
general
economy
and
prosperity.
now,
that
claim
was
sustained
by
judge
pence
on
what
we
think
is
most
extraordinary
misreading
of
the
georgia
case
which
i
will
come
to
in
a
moment.
and
it
was
appealed
on
special
appeals
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
only
decision
and
only
question
before
the
court
of
appeals
was
whether
the
fourth
amended
complaint
of
hawaii
in
this
case
asserting
a
cause
of
action
in
addition
to
its
cause
of
action
for
damaged
business
and
property
or
an
injury
to
its
general
economy
and
prosperity
is
a
claim
that
they
will
be
recovered
under
the
sherman
act.
we
submit
that
for
four
reasons,
this
claim
could
not
be
recovered,
first
because
the
injury
to
the
general
economy
and
prosperity
of
hawaii
is
not
an
injury
to
its
business
or
property
within
the
meaning
of
section
4.
secondly,
because
even
if
it
could
be
considered
the
business
and
property
of
hawaii,
nevertheless,
the
injury
is
so
remote,
consequential
and
indirect
as
to
fall
clearly
outside
the
area
which
the
standing
cases
upheld
must
be
the
injured
person
must
be
within.
those
two
dispose
off
the
case
and
they
were
the
only
two
decided
by
the
court
below.
but
there
are
two
other,
that
i
will
mention
briefly
that
we
think
stand
as
in
severable
obstacles
to
hawaii’s
maintenance
of
this
suit.
the
first
is
that
the
very
nature
of
the
right
which
a
state
must
assert
in
order
to
have
a
standing
to
sue
parens
patriae
as
its
sovereign.
namely
the
injury
to
its
citizens
as
a
whole
to
its
entire
social
community,
is
the
type
of
injury
which
cannot
be
measured
by
a
money
calculus
and
that
an
injunction
is
the
only
remedy
that
a
court
may
grant.
and
it
is
the
only
remedy
which
this
court
has
granted
in
any
of
the
parens
patriae
cases
before
it
over
the
course
of
nearly
a
hundred
years.
and
finally
we
contend
that
in
this
case
since
the
gravamen
of
the
complaint
is
a
price-fixing
conspiracy,
consumer
oriented
as
stated
in
the
reply
brief
of
petitioners
directed
at
the
consumers
in
a
particular
segment
of
the
economy.
that
that
is
the
type
of
injury
for
which
a
state
may
not
sue
parens
patriae
and
that
this
is
determined
by
the
oklahoma
case
in
this
court.
now
let
me
return
to
the
points
decided
by
the
court
below.
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
no.
the
state
of
--
that
is
correct
either
an
injunction
or
for
damages.
now
to
return
to
the
two
points
that
were
decided
by
the
court
below.
in
the
first
place
it
had
been
settled
of
course
since
at
least
the
northern
securities
case
that
the
remedies
provided
in
the
sherman
act
are
the
exclusive
remedies
for
the
enforcement
of
the
sherman
act
and
that
the
remedies
for
damages
under
the
sherman
act
are
those
provided
in
the
clayton
act.
the
clayton
act
provides
that
one
injury
by
anything
forbidden
in
the
antitrust
laws
in
his
business
or
property
may
recover
threefold
at
the
damages.
the
term
business
and
property
has
been
construed
over
and
over
again
by
the
courts
to
have
its
ordinary
meaning,
meaning
as
referring
to
business
venture
and
the
clayton
act
has
been
construed
to
apply
within
that
area
in
which
the
sherman
act
applies
which
is
in
the
stream
of
commerce.
it
is
as
this
court
said
in
the
north
case
an
act
tailored
to
the
marketplace.
and
it
has
never
been
conceived
by
anyone
that
an
injury
such
as
an
injury,
an
indescribable
and
immeasurable
injury,
in
addition
to
the
injury
to
the
state’s
business
and
property
which
has
not
contested,
is
an
injury
to
business
and
property
of
the
state
within
the
meaning
of
section
4.
when
congress
amended
the
clayton
act
in
1955
to
give
united
states
the
cause
of
action
similar
to
that
--
that
this
court
had
held
georgia,
evans,
georgia
against
evans,
it
belonged
to
the
state.
and
permitted
it
to
sue
for
an
injury
to
its
business
and
property.
there
is
nothing
in
the
reports,
nothing
that
could
possibly
indicate
that
when
that
right
was
given
the
united
states
was
being
given
a
right
to
sue
in
addition
for
an
injury
to
its
business
or
property,
the
right
to
sue
for
some
immeasurable
harm
to
its
general
economy
and
prosperity.
we
believe
that
no
precedent
sustains
that
and
as
i
say
the
unusual
thing
in
this
case
is
the
misreading
by
the
court,
the
district
court
of
the
georgia
case
to
repeat
that
is
requiring
that
decision.
now,
the
georgia
case
does
not
meet
this
case
at
all.
in
georgia,
there
were
two
counts,
in
the
fill
up
complaint
by
georgia
which
were
considered
by
this
court.
one
was
the
suit,
a
count
alleging
an
injury
to
georgia
as
a
proprietor,
or
injury
to
the
railroads
owned
by
these
institutions
and
so
on.
and
under
that
count,
it
prayed
for
treble
damages
under
the
clayton
act.
the
other
count
was
a
parens
patriae
count
and
under
that
count,
the
state
prayed
for
an
injunction
and
it
also
had
an
unusual
money
damage
statement
in
there.
it
stated
that
the
injury
to
the
state
of
georgia
as
parens
patriae
an
injury
to
its
entire
economy
was
of
such
a
nature
that
it
could
not
be
measured
by
money
damages,
but
on
the
state
of
georgia,
that
does
not
mean
that
we
have
not
been
injured
and
therefore
we
ask
this
court
to
award
us
“token
damages”
in
an
amount
not
to
exceed
$5
million.
a
request
in
the
nature,
we
request
to
an
international
tribunal
to
award
reparation.
as
far
as
the
decision
of
this
court
indicates,
the
request
for
token
damages
in
the
parens
patriae
count,
is
not
again
mentioned
or
considered.
but
what
this
court
held
was,
first
on
georgia's
proprietary
count
which
was
the
only
count
for
treble
damages
in
the
case.
the
court
did
not
recover
damages
because
of
the
rule
of
the
keogh
case
which
does
not
permit
treble
damages
with
respect
to
race
proved
by
the
commission.
but
this
did
not
dispose
off
the
main
prayer
of
the
complaint
which
was
for
an
injunction.
the
court
then
went
onto
hold
that
georgia
as
a
sovereign
had
the
right
at
a
standing
to
sue
for
an
injunction
against
the
conspiracy
that
underlay
the
rates
that
have
been
fixed
and
that
injured
georgia.
and
that
is
all
the
georgia
case
was.
it
has
always
been
quite
impossible
for
me
to
understand
how
judge
pence
could
have
misread
the
case.
it
has
no
bearing
whatsoever
upon
a
claim
of
a
state
to
obtain
treble
damages
under
the
clayton
act
for
an
injury
to
its
business
or
prosperity.
that
claim
was
impleaded,
was
not
argued,
was
not
considered,
it
could
not
possibly
been
in
the
mind
of
the
court.
the
next
ground
of
the
decision
by
the
court
below
is
we
think
equally
compelling.
at
least
since
the
decision
of
the
eastman
case
in
1910,
the
courts
of
this
nation
have
held
that
injuries
that
are
remote
from
the
stream
of
commerce
upon
which
the
conspiracy
acts
may
not
be
recovered.
it
is
the
rule
of
every
circuit,
certiorari
has
been
denied
in
numerous
cases.
but
the
rule
has
been
stated
in
various
ways
said
that
the
injury
must
be
direct
instead
of
indirect.
it
said
that
the
person
who
seeks
damages
must
be
within
the
target
area
at
which
the
conspiracy
was
directed.
under
this
principle
employees
of
corporations
who
have
suffered
from
an
injury,
from
a
conspiracy,
creditors
of
that
corporations,
stockholders
of
that
corporation,
royalty
holders,
lessors
have
been
held
not
to
be
within
the
area
of
directness
which
must
be
proved
before
recovery
maybe
had
under
the
clayton
act.
on
the
other
hand,
where
the
impact
of
the
conspiracy
was
intended
to
fall
upon
particular
suppliers,
as
in
the
case
of
a
conspiracy
concerned
with
explosive
dealing,
then
not
only
the
competitor
of
the
person
who
conspired
but
it
is
the
supplier
has
been
held
to
be
sufficiently
connected
with
the
conspiracy.
in
some
cases
where
the
lessor
has
had
rents
that
are
computed
on
the
receipts
of
the
lessee
who
has
been
injured
by
the
conspiracy,
he
has
been
held
sufficiently
direct.
but
no
case,
as
even
considered,
effects
of
a
conspiracy
upon
consumers
in
a
particular
segment
of
the
state's
economy,
upon
the
entire
economy
and
prosperity
of
that
state
which
has
reacted
upon
by
everything
that
happens
within
the
state.
it
seems
clear
beyond
question
that
it
lies
entirely
outside
of
the
area
of
any
realm
of
directness.
it
is
far
less
direct
and
the
charity
to
whom
the
corporation
might
have
attributed,
but
for
the
injury,
it
is
far
less
direct
from
the
injury
to
the
school
to
whom
the
son
of
an
employee
might
have
gone,
but
for
diminution
of
his
earnings,
occasioned
by
the
diminution
in
earnings
the
corporation
occasion
by
the
conspiracy.
it
is
simply
outside
the
area.
for
these
reasons
the
court
below
reversed
the
district
court
and
we
think
properly
so.
and
it
is
not
necessary
to
go
beyond
that
in
order
to
sustain
that
decision.
but
there
are
two
principles
we
think
that
are
important
which
the
state
would
have
to
overcome
as
we
submit.
it
cannot
if
it
were
to
maintain
its
action
in
this
case.
and
the
first
one
of
these
as
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago
is
the
fact
that
when
a
state
appears
parens
patriae,
it
must
assert
a
right
which
is
sovereign
in
its
nature
as
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
held,
which
affects
the
welfare
and
the
health
and
the
prosperity
of
the
entire
community.
this
court
has
described
it
as
rights
over
and
beyond
the
state's
properties
rights
and
all
the
rights
of
its
citizens.
that
type
of
right
is
the
type
that
georgia
asserts
and
that
hawaii
asserts
in
this
case.
it
states
that
the
injury
that
has
been
done
has
hindered
its
economic
growth,
has
prevented
its
manufacturers
from
growing.
it
is
the
type
of
injury
that
was
alleged
in
the
georgia
case.
but,
that
type
of
injury
is
an
injury
which
the
state
of
georgia
itself
said
in
its
bill
of
complaint
in
this
case
and
understandably
so,
is
not
measurable
by
a
money
calculus.
it
simply
does
not
present
a
case
or
controversy,
it
is
not
a
justiciable
issue
and
it
certainly
is
not
an
issue
which
under
any
rational
system
of
law
could
be
tried
to
a
jury.
there
is
no
way
and
to
segregate
the
economy
of
a
state
from
the
economy
of
the
united
states,
actually
from
the
standpoint
of
proof
with
the
models
that
econometricians
have
made,
it
would
be
easier
to
measure
the
effect
upon
the
national
product
of
the
united
states
than
it
would
be
a
upon
a
state.
the
economy
of
a
state
is
so
dependent
upon
the
surrounding
state.
it
simply
does
not
present
a
justiciable
issue.
therefore
the
only
relief
that
could
be
met
would
be
an
injunction
against
the
wrong
that
has
been
directed
against
that
state.
now
the
final
reason
is
this.
it
was
articulated
by
the
dissenting
judges
in
georgia
and
the
opinion
of
the
court
that
met
the
views
of
the
dissenting
judges,
makes
so
very
clear
the
principle
upon
which
i
rely.
in
oklahoma
against
atchison,
topeka
&
santa
fe,
a
bill
of
complaint
was
filed
in
this
court
alleging
that
the
railroad
had
overcharged
the
citizens
of
oklahoma
rates
and
it
alleged
that
the
industry
of
oklahoma,
the
oil
industry,
the
building
industry,
the
construction
industry
of
oklahoma
as
a
young
growing
state,
was
being
seriously
affected
by
this
overcharge.
and
that
the
overcharge
of
these
rates
was
adversely
affecting
the
economy
of
the
state
and
would
hinder
its
growth
and
development.
charges
which
are
virtually
identical
with
the
charges
that
are
made
in
this
case,
but
not
with
those
in
georgia,
this
court
dismissed
the
bill
holding
that
the
gravamen
of
the
complaint
was
simply
the
allegation
of
injury
to
individual
citizens
of
the
state
and
each
of
those
citizens
had
a
remedy.
now,
when
the
georgia
case
came,
allegations
there
were
also
made
that
the
economy
of
the
state
had
been
hindering
this
growth,
and
had
been
seriously
and
adversely
affected.
but
this
court
construed
in
meeting
the
allegations
on
the
decision
of
oklahoma.
this
court
construed
and
twice
specifically
stated
that
it
construed
the
allegations
in
the
georgia
bill
to
allege
a
conspiracy
directed
at
georgia
as
a
state
and
further
that
the
conspiracy
there
alleged
was
to
establish
discriminatory
rates,
discriminating
against
georgia
geographically
as
a
state,
so
as
to
erect
a
trade
barrier
around
that
state
and
disadvantages
economically
vis-à-vis
the
other
states
of
the
union.
now,
there
is
extraordinary
allegation,
the
court
found
--
was
the
type
of
allegation
that
was
not
present
in
the
oklahoma
case
and
it
did
give
georgia
standing
if
it
could
proved
those
allegations
for
an
injunction,
not
for
damages,
against
the
continuation
of
that
conspiracy.
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
yes,
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
it
would
be
to
prevent
irreparable
injury
and
one
of
the
injury
--
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
the
allegation
--
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
well,
there
were
two
types
of
injuries,
one
was
the
injury
that
georgia
suffered
by
the
excessive
rates
paid
by
railroads
owned
by
it
and
by
institutions
that
it
owned.
and
the
other
type
of
injury
was
the
injury
to
georgia
as
an
organized
community.
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
well
--
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
symptom
of
it?
i
would
--
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
prove
mr.
justice,
but
georgia
alleged
that
its
industries
had
been
hindered.
that
in
the
north
industry
had
grown
and
into
the
south,
it
had
been
retarded.
of
course,
when
they
came
to
prove,
then
the
master
held
that
they
--
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
it
would
be
and
somehow
you
would
finally
aggregate
those.
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
it
called
it
its
economy.
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
well,
i
would
agree
that
georgia,
i
would
agree
that
georgia
and
the
injunction
that
this
court
said,
could
not
grant
it
in
georgia,
does
not
operate
as
a
precedent
for
an
injunction
in
this
case.
it
--
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
mr.
justice,
i
cannot
be
wrong
about
that
because
the
written
words
--
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
oh!
no.
no,
i
am
talking
about
the
distinction
of
the
georgia
case
from
this
case.
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
it
has
no
bearing
on
this
case,
it
has
no
bearing
on
this
case
because
when
you
call
one
--
the
state
--
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
that
is
true.
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
i
am
simply
saying,
your
honor
that
the
state
does
not
have
standing
to
sue
parens
patriae,
it
is
another
reason
for
dismissal,
but
as
far
as
its
impact
upon
this
case
is
concerned,
it
is
negligible.
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
what?
that
--
that
an
injunction
can
issue
in
this
case
mr.
justice.
if
an
issue
under
count,
one
of
the
complaint
under
section
16.
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
it
would
be
no
difference
in
the
reliefs
that
they
could
get.
i
would
simply
say
this,
that
a
court
in
the
appropriate
administration
of
justice
would
say
the
state
sues
as
parens
patriae
and
as
a
proprietor.
we,
as
parens
patriae,
it
does
not
have
standing
to
sue
but
it
has
the
right
to
obtain
the
same
relief
under
count
one
and
so
regret
the
injunction.
the
problem
of
measuring
the
economy
does
not
come
until
you
reach
the
area
of
damages.
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
the
injunction
is
against
the
continuance
of
the
conspiracy.
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
yes
and
i
think
that
would
be
bad
law.
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
very
well.
then
it
has
no
effect
upon
the
result
in
this
case.
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
that
is
right
and
the
only
wrong
that
the
petitioner
complaints
off
as
injuring
in
the
state
is
the
conspiracy.
and
the
conspiracy
approved
may
be
enjoined.
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
no,
no.
it
did
not
--
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
it
did
not
reach
the
points
with
respect
to
parens
patriae.
i
did
not
find
it
necessary
to
and
most
respectfully
i
submit
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
reach
those
points.
now,
if
i
may
say
just
a
word
in
closing,
i
am
not
unmindful
of
the
policy
argument
that
petitioners
urged
before
this
court
with
respect
to
liberal
enforcement
of
the
antitrust
laws.
i
think
it
can
be
no
disagreement
with
the
fact
that
the
sherman
act
expressed
its
principles
just
as
a
fundamental
to
our
economic
life
as
the
bill
of
rights
does
for
civil
liberty.
but
as
i
pointed
out
earlier,
it
has
been
held
from
the
beginning
that
the
remedies
under
the
sherman
act
are
the
exclusive
remedies
for
its
enforcement.
cases
like
j.i
case
and
bevin
and
solomon
to
which
mr.
blecher
referred
are
cases
where
the
court
has
as
it
always
has
supplied
from
its
arsenal
of
actions
a
remedy
for
any
person
who
has
suffered
from
a
violation
of
his
rights
enacted
by
a
statute
where
the
statute
does
not
provide
for
a
remedy.
but
here
the
statute
does
provide
for
remedies
and
they
have
been
held
over
and
over
to
be
exclusive.
the
other
point
is
i
think
that
factually,
mr.
blecher
i
think
is
mistaken.
this
court
is
familiar
with
the
statistics
that
are
handed
down
by
the
administrative
office.
so
in
the
last
ten
years,
the
number
of
private,
treble
damage
actions
filed
every
year
in
this
country
has
nearly
quadrupled.
and
as
of
last
june,
there
were
over
2,000
antitrust
cases
pending
in
the
federal
courts
of
this
country.
and
as
all
of
us
who
are
familiar
with
the
nature
of
those
cases
go,
there
are
many,
many
a
class
actions,
and
the
result
is
that
there
are
literally
millions
of
plaintiffs
before
the
courts
of
this
country
today
in
treble
damage,
antitrust
actions.
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
yes,
i
think
so.
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
i
think
they
could
still
--
probably
if
the
congress
could
give
the
states
a
right
to
sue
for
damages
to
its
citizens.
i
do
not
think
it
is
likely
that
congress
would,
it
is
most
unlikely
that
it
would.
judge
rehal
(ph)
in
one
of
these
cases
has
held
that
the
state
can
exercises
its
powers,
the
ancient
powers
of
the
king,
parens
patriae
to
as
a
protector
of
incompetences,
idiots
and
the
lunatics.
and
he
had
said
that
any
antitrust
defendant,
potential
defendant
who
does
not
have
a
size
large
enough
to
make
him
wish
to
litigated
is
non
sui
juris,
therefore
incompetent
and
therefore
the
state
can
sue
this
decision
i
think
will
be
appealed.
but
the
last
thing
that
i
do
wish
to
emphasize
is
that,
in
fact,
the
remedies
provided
by
congress
are
providing
a
very
formidable
arsenal
for
the
enforcement
of
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
view
of
the
remarks
of
mr.
blecher,
i
think
it
might
be
helpful
to
clarify
what
is
before
this
court
and
what
is
not.
he
referred
to
recovery
of
the
amounts
suffered
by
these
damages,
suffered
by
the
citizens
of
hawaii.
in
the
third
amended
complaint
in
this
case,
hawaii
pleaded
first
the
cause
of
action
for
damages
to
which
business
and
property,
its
proprietor.
and
second,
a
cause
of
action
for
damages
suffered
by
its
citizens.
on
the
authority
of
an
unbroken
line
of
decisions
by
this
court,
judge
pence
dismissed
that
count,
as
have
the
other
judges
who
considered
it
below
except
for
one.
holding
at
the
state
of
hawaii
had
no
standing
as
parens
patriae
(inaudible)
recover
for
the
injuries
to
its
citizens.
thereupon,
hawaii
filed
a
fourth
amended
complaint
with
a
totally
different
cause
of
action.
and
this
time,
it
asserted
as
its
parens
patriae,
a
claim
for
damages
sustained
by
it
as
distinguished
from
its
citizens.
but
a
claim,
in
addition,
to
its
injury
to
business
and
property
provided
by
section
4,
of
the
clayton
act,
namely
a
claim
for
injury
to
its
general
economy
and
prosperity.
now,
that
claim
was
sustained
by
judge
pence
on
what
we
think
is
most
extraordinary
misreading
of
the
georgia
case
which
i
will
come
to
in
a
moment.
and
it
was
appealed
on
special
appeals
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
only
decision
and
only
question
before
the
court
of
appeals
was
whether
the
fourth
amended
complaint
of
hawaii
in
this
case
asserting
a
cause
of
action
in
addition
to
its
cause
of
action
for
damaged
business
and
property
or
an
injury
to
its
general
economy
and
prosperity
is
a
claim
that
they
will
be
recovered
under
the
sherman
act.
we
submit
that
for
four
reasons,
this
claim
could
not
be
recovered,
first
because
the
injury
to
the
general
economy
and
prosperity
of
hawaii
is
not
an
injury
to
its
business
or
property
within
the
meaning
of
section
4.
secondly,
because
even
if
it
could
be
considered
the
business
and
property
of
hawaii,
nevertheless,
the
injury
is
so
remote,
consequential
and
indirect
as
to
fall
clearly
outside
the
area
which
the
standing
cases
upheld
must
be
the
injured
person
must
be
within.
those
two
dispose
off
the
case
and
they
were
the
only
two
decided
by
the
court
below.
but
there
are
two
other,
that
i
will
mention
briefly
that
we
think
stand
as
in
severable
obstacles
to
hawaii’s
maintenance
of
this
suit.
the
first
is
that
the
very
nature
of
the
right
which
a
state
must
assert
in
order
to
have
a
standing
to
sue
parens
patriae
as
its
sovereign.
namely
the
injury
to
its
citizens
as
a
whole
to
its
entire
social
community,
is
the
type
of
injury
which
cannot
be
measured
by
a
money
calculus
and
that
an
injunction
is
the
only
remedy
that
a
court
may
grant.
and
it
is
the
only
remedy
which
this
court
has
granted
in
any
of
the
parens
patriae
cases
before
it
over
the
course
of
nearly
a
hundred
years.
and
finally
we
contend
that
in
this
case
since
the
gravamen
of
the
complaint
is
a
price-fixing
conspiracy,
consumer
oriented
as
stated
in
the
reply
brief
of
petitioners
directed
at
the
consumers
in
a
particular
segment
of
the
economy.
that
that
is
the
type
of
injury
for
which
a
state
may
not
sue
parens
patriae
and
that
this
is
determined
by
the
oklahoma
case
in
this
court.
now
let
me
return
to
the
points
decided
by
the
court
below.
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
no.
the
state
of
--
that
is
correct
either
an
injunction
or
for
damages.
now
to
return
to
the
two
points
that
were
decided
by
the
court
below.
in
the
first
place
it
had
been
settled
of
course
since
at
least
the
northern
securities
case
that
the
remedies
provided
in
the
sherman
act
are
the
exclusive
remedies
for
the
enforcement
of
the
sherman
act
and
that
the
remedies
for
damages
under
the
sherman
act
are
those
provided
in
the
clayton
act.
the
clayton
act
provides
that
one
injury
by
anything
forbidden
in
the
antitrust
laws
in
his
business
or
property
may
recover
threefold
at
the
damages.
the
term
business
and
property
has
been
construed
over
and
over
again
by
the
courts
to
have
its
ordinary
meaning,
meaning
as
referring
to
business
venture
and
the
clayton
act
has
been
construed
to
apply
within
that
area
in
which
the
sherman
act
applies
which
is
in
the
stream
of
commerce.
it
is
as
this
court
said
in
the
north
case
an
act
tailored
to
the
marketplace.
and
it
has
never
been
conceived
by
anyone
that
an
injury
such
as
an
injury,
an
indescribable
and
immeasurable
injury,
in
addition
to
the
injury
to
the
state’s
business
and
property
which
has
not
contested,
is
an
injury
to
business
and
property
of
the
state
within
the
meaning
of
section
4.
when
congress
amended
the
clayton
act
in
1955
to
give
united
states
the
cause
of
action
similar
to
that
--
that
this
court
had
held
georgia,
evans,
georgia
against
evans,
it
belonged
to
the
state.
and
permitted
it
to
sue
for
an
injury
to
its
business
and
property.
there
is
nothing
in
the
reports,
nothing
that
could
possibly
indicate
that
when
that
right
was
given
the
united
states
was
being
given
a
right
to
sue
in
addition
for
an
injury
to
its
business
or
property,
the
right
to
sue
for
some
immeasurable
harm
to
its
general
economy
and
prosperity.
we
believe
that
no
precedent
sustains
that
and
as
i
say
the
unusual
thing
in
this
case
is
the
misreading
by
the
court,
the
district
court
of
the
georgia
case
to
repeat
that
is
requiring
that
decision.
now,
the
georgia
case
does
not
meet
this
case
at
all.
in
georgia,
there
were
two
counts,
in
the
fill
up
complaint
by
georgia
which
were
considered
by
this
court.
one
was
the
suit,
a
count
alleging
an
injury
to
georgia
as
a
proprietor,
or
injury
to
the
railroads
owned
by
these
institutions
and
so
on.
and
under
that
count,
it
prayed
for
treble
damages
under
the
clayton
act.
the
other
count
was
a
parens
patriae
count
and
under
that
count,
the
state
prayed
for
an
injunction
and
it
also
had
an
unusual
money
damage
statement
in
there.
it
stated
that
the
injury
to
the
state
of
georgia
as
parens
patriae
an
injury
to
its
entire
economy
was
of
such
a
nature
that
it
could
not
be
measured
by
money
damages,
but
on
the
state
of
georgia,
that
does
not
mean
that
we
have
not
been
injured
and
therefore
we
ask
this
court
to
award
us
“token
damages”
in
an
amount
not
to
exceed
$5
million.
a
request
in
the
nature,
we
request
to
an
international
tribunal
to
award
reparation.
as
far
as
the
decision
of
this
court
indicates,
the
request
for
token
damages
in
the
parens
patriae
count,
is
not
again
mentioned
or
considered.
but
what
this
court
held
was,
first
on
georgia's
proprietary
count
which
was
the
only
count
for
treble
damages
in
the
case.
the
court
did
not
recover
damages
because
of
the
rule
of
the
keogh
case
which
does
not
permit
treble
damages
with
respect
to
race
proved
by
the
commission.
but
this
did
not
dispose
off
the
main
prayer
of
the
complaint
which
was
for
an
injunction.
the
court
then
went
onto
hold
that
georgia
as
a
sovereign
had
the
right
at
a
standing
to
sue
for
an
injunction
against
the
conspiracy
that
underlay
the
rates
that
have
been
fixed
and
that
injured
georgia.
and
that
is
all
the
georgia
case
was.
it
has
always
been
quite
impossible
for
me
to
understand
how
judge
pence
could
have
misread
the
case.
it
has
no
bearing
whatsoever
upon
a
claim
of
a
state
to
obtain
treble
damages
under
the
clayton
act
for
an
injury
to
its
business
or
prosperity.
that
claim
was
impleaded,
was
not
argued,
was
not
considered,
it
could
not
possibly
been
in
the
mind
of
the
court.
the
next
ground
of
the
decision
by
the
court
below
is
we
think
equally
compelling.
at
least
since
the
decision
of
the
eastman
case
in
1910,
the
courts
of
this
nation
have
held
that
injuries
that
are
remote
from
the
stream
of
commerce
upon
which
the
conspiracy
acts
may
not
be
recovered.
it
is
the
rule
of
every
circuit,
certiorari
has
been
denied
in
numerous
cases.
but
the
rule
has
been
stated
in
various
ways
said
that
the
injury
must
be
direct
instead
of
indirect.
it
said
that
the
person
who
seeks
damages
must
be
within
the
target
area
at
which
the
conspiracy
was
directed.
under
this
principle
employees
of
corporations
who
have
suffered
from
an
injury,
from
a
conspiracy,
creditors
of
that
corporations,
stockholders
of
that
corporation,
royalty
holders,
lessors
have
been
held
not
to
be
within
the
area
of
directness
which
must
be
proved
before
recovery
maybe
had
under
the
clayton
act.
on
the
other
hand,
where
the
impact
of
the
conspiracy
was
intended
to
fall
upon
particular
suppliers,
as
in
the
case
of
a
conspiracy
concerned
with
explosive
dealing,
then
not
only
the
competitor
of
the
person
who
conspired
but
it
is
the
supplier
has
been
held
to
be
sufficiently
connected
with
the
conspiracy.
in
some
cases
where
the
lessor
has
had
rents
that
are
computed
on
the
receipts
of
the
lessee
who
has
been
injured
by
the
conspiracy,
he
has
been
held
sufficiently
direct.
but
no
case,
as
even
considered,
effects
of
a
conspiracy
upon
consumers
in
a
particular
segment
of
the
state's
economy,
upon
the
entire
economy
and
prosperity
of
that
state
which
has
reacted
upon
by
everything
that
happens
within
the
state.
it
seems
clear
beyond
question
that
it
lies
entirely
outside
of
the
area
of
any
realm
of
directness.
it
is
far
less
direct
and
the
charity
to
whom
the
corporation
might
have
attributed,
but
for
the
injury,
it
is
far
less
direct
from
the
injury
to
the
school
to
whom
the
son
of
an
employee
might
have
gone,
but
for
diminution
of
his
earnings,
occasioned
by
the
diminution
in
earnings
the
corporation
occasion
by
the
conspiracy.
it
is
simply
outside
the
area.
for
these
reasons
the
court
below
reversed
the
district
court
and
we
think
properly
so.
and
it
is
not
necessary
to
go
beyond
that
in
order
to
sustain
that
decision.
but
there
are
two
principles
we
think
that
are
important
which
the
state
would
have
to
overcome
as
we
submit.
it
cannot
if
it
were
to
maintain
its
action
in
this
case.
and
the
first
one
of
these
as
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago
is
the
fact
that
when
a
state
appears
parens
patriae,
it
must
assert
a
right
which
is
sovereign
in
its
nature
as
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
held,
which
affects
the
welfare
and
the
health
and
the
prosperity
of
the
entire
community.
this
court
has
described
it
as
rights
over
and
beyond
the
state's
properties
rights
and
all
the
rights
of
its
citizens.
that
type
of
right
is
the
type
that
georgia
asserts
and
that
hawaii
asserts
in
this
case.
it
states
that
the
injury
that
has
been
done
has
hindered
its
economic
growth,
has
prevented
its
manufacturers
from
growing.
it
is
the
type
of
injury
that
was
alleged
in
the
georgia
case.
but,
that
type
of
injury
is
an
injury
which
the
state
of
georgia
itself
said
in
its
bill
of
complaint
in
this
case
and
understandably
so,
is
not
measurable
by
a
money
calculus.
it
simply
does
not
present
a
case
or
controversy,
it
is
not
a
justiciable
issue
and
it
certainly
is
not
an
issue
which
under
any
rational
system
of
law
could
be
tried
to
a
jury.
there
is
no
way
and
to
segregate
the
economy
of
a
state
from
the
economy
of
the
united
states,
actually
from
the
standpoint
of
proof
with
the
models
that
econometricians
have
made,
it
would
be
easier
to
measure
the
effect
upon
the
national
product
of
the
united
states
than
it
would
be
a
upon
a
state.
the
economy
of
a
state
is
so
dependent
upon
the
surrounding
state.
it
simply
does
not
present
a
justiciable
issue.
therefore
the
only
relief
that
could
be
met
would
be
an
injunction
against
the
wrong
that
has
been
directed
against
that
state.
now
the
final
reason
is
this.
it
was
articulated
by
the
dissenting
judges
in
georgia
and
the
opinion
of
the
court
that
met
the
views
of
the
dissenting
judges,
makes
so
very
clear
the
principle
upon
which
i
rely.
in
oklahoma
against
atchison,
topeka
&
santa
fe,
a
bill
of
complaint
was
filed
in
this
court
alleging
that
the
railroad
had
overcharged
the
citizens
of
oklahoma
rates
and
it
alleged
that
the
industry
of
oklahoma,
the
oil
industry,
the
building
industry,
the
construction
industry
of
oklahoma
as
a
young
growing
state,
was
being
seriously
affected
by
this
overcharge.
and
that
the
overcharge
of
these
rates
was
adversely
affecting
the
economy
of
the
state
and
would
hinder
its
growth
and
development.
charges
which
are
virtually
identical
with
the
charges
that
are
made
in
this
case,
but
not
with
those
in
georgia,
this
court
dismissed
the
bill
holding
that
the
gravamen
of
the
complaint
was
simply
the
allegation
of
injury
to
individual
citizens
of
the
state
and
each
of
those
citizens
had
a
remedy.
now,
when
the
georgia
case
came,
allegations
there
were
also
made
that
the
economy
of
the
state
had
been
hindering
this
growth,
and
had
been
seriously
and
adversely
affected.
but
this
court
construed
in
meeting
the
allegations
on
the
decision
of
oklahoma.
this
court
construed
and
twice
specifically
stated
that
it
construed
the
allegations
in
the
georgia
bill
to
allege
a
conspiracy
directed
at
georgia
as
a
state
and
further
that
the
conspiracy
there
alleged
was
to
establish
discriminatory
rates,
discriminating
against
georgia
geographically
as
a
state,
so
as
to
erect
a
trade
barrier
around
that
state
and
disadvantages
economically
vis-à-vis
the
other
states
of
the
union.
now,
there
is
extraordinary
allegation,
the
court
found
--
was
the
type
of
allegation
that
was
not
present
in
the
oklahoma
case
and
it
did
give
georgia
standing
if
it
could
proved
those
allegations
for
an
injunction,
not
for
damages,
against
the
continuation
of
that
conspiracy.
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
yes,
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
it
would
be
to
prevent
irreparable
injury
and
one
of
the
injury
--
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
the
allegation
--
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
well,
there
were
two
types
of
injuries,
one
was
the
injury
that
georgia
suffered
by
the
excessive
rates
paid
by
railroads
owned
by
it
and
by
institutions
that
it
owned.
and
the
other
type
of
injury
was
the
injury
to
georgia
as
an
organized
community.
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
well
--
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
symptom
of
it?
i
would
--
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
prove
mr.
justice,
but
georgia
alleged
that
its
industries
had
been
hindered.
that
in
the
north
industry
had
grown
and
into
the
south,
it
had
been
retarded.
of
course,
when
they
came
to
prove,
then
the
master
held
that
they
--
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
it
would
be
and
somehow
you
would
finally
aggregate
those.
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
it
called
it
its
economy.
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
well,
i
would
agree
that
georgia,
i
would
agree
that
georgia
and
the
injunction
that
this
court
said,
could
not
grant
it
in
georgia,
does
not
operate
as
a
precedent
for
an
injunction
in
this
case.
it
--
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
mr.
justice,
i
cannot
be
wrong
about
that
because
the
written
words
--
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
oh!
no.
no,
i
am
talking
about
the
distinction
of
the
georgia
case
from
this
case.
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
it
has
no
bearing
on
this
case,
it
has
no
bearing
on
this
case
because
when
you
call
one
--
the
state
--
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
that
is
true.
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
i
am
simply
saying,
your
honor
that
the
state
does
not
have
standing
to
sue
parens
patriae,
it
is
another
reason
for
dismissal,
but
as
far
as
its
impact
upon
this
case
is
concerned,
it
is
negligible.
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
what?
that
--
that
an
injunction
can
issue
in
this
case
mr.
justice.
if
an
issue
under
count,
one
of
the
complaint
under
section
16.
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
it
would
be
no
difference
in
the
reliefs
that
they
could
get.
i
would
simply
say
this,
that
a
court
in
the
appropriate
administration
of
justice
would
say
the
state
sues
as
parens
patriae
and
as
a
proprietor.
we,
as
parens
patriae,
it
does
not
have
standing
to
sue
but
it
has
the
right
to
obtain
the
same
relief
under
count
one
and
so
regret
the
injunction.
the
problem
of
measuring
the
economy
does
not
come
until
you
reach
the
area
of
damages.
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
the
injunction
is
against
the
continuance
of
the
conspiracy.
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
yes
and
i
think
that
would
be
bad
law.
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
very
well.
then
it
has
no
effect
upon
the
result
in
this
case.
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
that
is
right
and
the
only
wrong
that
the
petitioner
complaints
off
as
injuring
in
the
state
is
the
conspiracy.
and
the
conspiracy
approved
may
be
enjoined.
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
no,
no.
it
did
not
--
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
it
did
not
reach
the
points
with
respect
to
parens
patriae.
i
did
not
find
it
necessary
to
and
most
respectfully
i
submit
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
reach
those
points.
now,
if
i
may
say
just
a
word
in
closing,
i
am
not
unmindful
of
the
policy
argument
that
petitioners
urged
before
this
court
with
respect
to
liberal
enforcement
of
the
antitrust
laws.
i
think
it
can
be
no
disagreement
with
the
fact
that
the
sherman
act
expressed
its
principles
just
as
a
fundamental
to
our
economic
life
as
the
bill
of
rights
does
for
civil
liberty.
but
as
i
pointed
out
earlier,
it
has
been
held
from
the
beginning
that
the
remedies
under
the
sherman
act
are
the
exclusive
remedies
for
its
enforcement.
cases
like
j.i
case
and
bevin
and
solomon
to
which
mr.
blecher
referred
are
cases
where
the
court
has
as
it
always
has
supplied
from
its
arsenal
of
actions
a
remedy
for
any
person
who
has
suffered
from
a
violation
of
his
rights
enacted
by
a
statute
where
the
statute
does
not
provide
for
a
remedy.
but
here
the
statute
does
provide
for
remedies
and
they
have
been
held
over
and
over
to
be
exclusive.
the
other
point
is
i
think
that
factually,
mr.
blecher
i
think
is
mistaken.
this
court
is
familiar
with
the
statistics
that
are
handed
down
by
the
administrative
office.
so
in
the
last
ten
years,
the
number
of
private,
treble
damage
actions
filed
every
year
in
this
country
has
nearly
quadrupled.
and
as
of
last
june,
there
were
over
2,000
antitrust
cases
pending
in
the
federal
courts
of
this
country.
and
as
all
of
us
who
are
familiar
with
the
nature
of
those
cases
go,
there
are
many,
many
a
class
actions,
and
the
result
is
that
there
are
literally
millions
of
plaintiffs
before
the
courts
of
this
country
today
in
treble
damage,
antitrust
actions.
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
yes,
i
think
so.
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
i
think
they
could
still
--
probably
if
the
congress
could
give
the
states
a
right
to
sue
for
damages
to
its
citizens.
i
do
not
think
it
is
likely
that
congress
would,
it
is
most
unlikely
that
it
would.
judge
rehal
(ph)
in
one
of
these
cases
has
held
that
the
state
can
exercises
its
powers,
the
ancient
powers
of
the
king,
parens
patriae
to
as
a
protector
of
incompetences,
idiots
and
the
lunatics.
and
he
had
said
that
any
antitrust
defendant,
potential
defendant
who
does
not
have
a
size
large
enough
to
make
him
wish
to
litigated
is
non
sui
juris,
therefore
incompetent
and
therefore
the
state
can
sue
this
decision
i
think
will
be
appealed.
but
the
last
thing
that
i
do
wish
to
emphasize
is
that,
in
fact,
the
remedies
provided
by
congress
are
providing
a
very
formidable
arsenal
for
the
enforcement
of
the
antitrust
laws.
