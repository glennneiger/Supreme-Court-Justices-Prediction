mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
may
please
the
court.
the
basic
issue
presented
by
this
appeal
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
ninth
circuit
is
whether
the
claim
of
a
state
parens
patriae
for
damages
under
the
antitrust
laws
presents
a
justiciable
controversy.
at
page
11
of
their
brief,
the
respondents
assert
that
we
are
asking
the
court
as
they
dramatically
put
in
“to
boldly
create
new
law”.
and
while
i
suppose
most
lawyers
appearing
before
this
aghast
body
would
like
in
some
measure
to
be
the
architect
of
some
new
jurisprudential
principle.
i
must
respectfully
submit
to
you
that
it
is
the
respondents
in
asking
you
to
affirm
what
we
regard
to
be
the
erroneous
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
who
in
fact
asked
you
to
make
new
law
by
overruling
the
established
law
made
by
this
court.
to
submit
to
the
court
that
under
two
separate
sets
of
precedents
and
analysis,
reversal
of
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
is
required.
and
to
begin
with
the
case
of
this
court
in
1945
in
state
of
georgia
versus
pennsylvania
railroad,
is
i
submit
dispositive
of
the
issue
framed
by
this
appeal.
in
that
case,
the
court
dealt
with
precisely
the
same
question
laid
before
it
here.
namely,
whether
a
justiciable
controversy
existed
by
the
claim
of
the
state
of
georgia
for
both
damages
and
injunctive
relief
alleged
parens
patriae
based
on
violations
of
the
antitrust
laws
in
the
railroad
industry.
and
while
this
court
in
holding
that
such
a
justiciable
controversy
was
presented
in
permitting
the
state
of
georgia
to
file
an
original
complaint
in
this
court.
ultimately
concluded
that
its
prior
holding
in
keogh
versus
chicago
and
northwestern
railroad
presented
an
impediment
of
the
collection
of
damages,
i
respectfully
submit
and
i
think
it
patently
obvious
that
the
interdiction
of
that
defense
is
completely
unrelated
to
the
standing
question
presented
by
this
appeal
and
is
no
more
relevant
than
if
the
claim
for
damages
would
have
been
barred
for
example,
by
the
statute
of
limitations
by
release,
by
res
judicata
or
by
some
other
substantive
legal
defense.
the
court
in
fact
dealt
with
the
same
question
whether
or
not
the
claim
could
be
perfected
in
equity
under
section
16
of
the
clayton
act
which
the
court
will
recall
interdicts
private
parties
from
securing
injunctive
relief
on
subject
matters
which
are
under
the
jurisdiction,
regulatory
jurisdiction
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
in
that
case
the
court
went
on
to
hold
that
section
16
did
not
interdict
georgia’s
claim
parens
patriae
for
equitable
relief.
but
the
basic
holding
remains
unimpaired,
the
district
court
found
that
the
georgia
case
was
dispositive
and
that
this
court
had
ruled
in
georgia
that
a
justiciable
controversy
is
presented
by
reason
of
a
section
for
a
claim
for
damages
parens
patriae
under
the
antitrust
laws
brought
by
a
state.
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
underpinning
of
georgia
is
the
recognition
by
this
court
that
section
4
of
the
clayton
act
which
permits
treble
damages
and
section
16
of
the
clayton
act
which
permits
equitable
relief
are
coextensive.
a
concept
expressly
articulated
later
by
this
court
in
its
first
decision
in
zenith
versus
hazeltine
in
1969
which
recognized
the
fact
that
the
two
statutes
afford
different
remedies
for
the
invasion
of
a
property
rights.
section
4
permits
damages
and
section
16
permits
injunctive
relief
against
threat
and
future
injury.
in
the
georgia
case,
it
must
be
clear
therefore
that
the
court
made
a
valued
judgment
and
said
that
the
interest
of
a
state
in
the
protection
of
its
general
economy
against
invasion,
constituted
a
property
right
capable
of
protection
and
capable
of
redress
under
the
antitrust
laws.
so
we
say
to
you
as
we
said
to
the
district
judge
that
where
conduct
violative
of
the
antitrust
laws
affects
the
general
welfare
of
the
state,
where
there
is
an
alleged
price-fixing
conspiracy
which
on
the
record
before
us,
we
must
accept
is
factually
supportive.
where
there
is
a
pervasive
price-fixing
conspiracy
affecting
a
large
number
of
consumers,
that
this
kind
of
controversy
which
affects
the
general
welfare
and
economy
of
a
state
rises
above
the
question
of
local
private
rights
and
involves
a
matter
of
state
interest
such
that
it
raises
a
property
interest
under
section
4
of
the
clayton
act
or
section
16
of
the
clayton
act
which
is
protected
parens
patriae
by
an
action
by
the
state.
now,
we
submit
here
that
it
is
unnecessary
to
reexamine
the
rationale
of
the
georgia
versus
pennsylvania
railroads
analysis.
we
would
contend
that
the
majority
opinion
of
mr.
justice
douglas
and
the
dissent
of
mr.
justice
stone
adequately
exhaust
the
merits
of
the
respected
positions
which
could
be
articulated
in
respect
to
whether
or
not
a
state
parens
patriae
can
make
a
claim
for
damages
under
the
antitrust
laws,
where
there
has
been
an
extensive
injury
to
the
consumers
of
the
state
by
reason
of
a
pervasive
antitrust
violation.
we
asked
only
that
the
court
here
reversed
the
error
of
the
ninth
circuit
in
holding
that
the
georgia
case
did
not
dispose
of
the
present
claim
in
to
district
court.
and
in
saying
that
we
urge
upon
you
that
as
respondents
who
are
here
before
you
in
effect
suggesting
that
you
repeal
the
decision
in
georgia
which
has
remained
unimpaired
for
more
than
25
years.
i
further
respectfully
submit
to
you
that
even
absent
of
decision
in
georgia
versus
pennsylvania
railroad.
this
court
and
the
basis
of
prior
precedence
would
not
be
charging
any
new
jurisprudential
ground
were
to
affirm
the
holding
of
the
district
court
and
reverse
the
ninth
circuit.
recall
in
the
case
of
j.i
case
company
versus
borak,
this
court
said
that
it
is
the
duty
of
the
courts
to
provide
such
remedies,
as
are
necessary
to
make
effective
a
congressional
purpose.
and
that
where
legal
rights
have
been
invaded
and
a
federal
statute
provides
for
a
general
right
to
sue
for
such
invasion,
federal
courts
may
use
any
available
remedy
to
make
good
the
wrong
done.
recently,
in
this
year,
the
court
again
in
the
case
of
bivens
versus
narcotics
agents,
citing
the
borak
case
concluded
that
it
was
the
responsibility
of
the
federal
judiciary
to
create
a
remedy,
to
write
a
wrong
where
an
act
of
congress
interdicted
specific
unlawful
conduct.
now,
how
do
those
decisions
apply
even
absent
the
georgia
precedent
to
this
particular
case?
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
they
ought
to
be
predicated
against
this
court's
statement
in
hanover
shoe
versus
united
shoe
machinery,
that
the
high
purpose
of
antitrust
enforcement
is
best
served
by
permitting
private
treble
damage
actions
as
an
effective
deterrent
to
violations
of
the
law.
and
as
this
court
recognized
in
hanover
that
any
holding
which
retains,
which
permits
a
group
of
antitrust
violators
to
retain
the
fruit
of
their
illegal
conduct
because
no
effective
suit
could
be
brought
against
them.
any
such
holding,
i
suggest
respectfully
must
undermine
the
effective
law
enforcement
through
treble
damage
litigation.
so
if
we
take
the
principles
of
borak
as
reaffirmed
earlier
this
year
in
the
bivens
case
against
the
background
of
the
judicial
and
legislative
purpose
to
be
served
by
treble
damage
litigation,
i
respectfully
submit
that
that
series
of
precedence
would
require
this
court
to
affirm
the
district
court.
and
here
again,
we
submit
to
you
that
it
is
the
respondents
and
not
the
appellant
who
ask
you
to
ignore
established
precedence
in
affirming
the
ninth
circuit
decision.
i
think
little
need
to
be
said
with
respect
to
the
subject
matter
of
damages
which
also
formed
in
part
a
basis
of
the
ninth
circuit’s
reversal
of
the
district
court’s
decision.
i
would
respectfully
characterize
the
holding
of
ninth
circuit
and
that
respect
is
antediluvian.
as
long
ago
we
passed
the
stage
in
the
development
of
antitrust
or
any
law
where
wrong
doers
are
permitted
to
retain
the
fruits
of
illegal
conduct
simply
because
there
is
some
difficulty
or
lack
of
precision
in
the
measurement
of
damages.
in
bigelow
versus
rko
in
1946,
this
court
made
that
principle
perfectly
clear
in
antitrust
law
and
it
is
finally
seeping
down
to
the
level
of
the
district
courts
and
the
courts
of
appeal.
the
gravament
of
this
charge
is
presented
by
the
state
and
the
district
court
is
that
it
is
entitled.
it
is
entitled
to
recover
the
overcharge
by
reason
of
the
price
fix
imposed
upon
the
consumers
of
the
state.
and
that
mathematical
computation
is
capable
i
submit
to
you
of
almost
precise
measurement,
the
first
mistake
that
permeates
to
court
of
appeal’s
determination
that
the
damages
in
this
case
are
simply
too
remote
and
speculative
to
be
measured.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
we
presented
the
court,
mr.
justice
stewart,
with
alternative
views
on
that.
it
is
essentially
a
matter
of
indifference
to
the
state
of
hawaii
except
that
the
administrative
burdens
would
be
substantially
reduced
if
your
hypothetical
were
correct,
that
the
money
belonged
to
the
state
and
in
effect
belonged
to
the
citizens
only
because
the
state
had
it
available
for
uses
which
would
reduce
the
tax
burden
of
its
citizens.
on
the
other
hand,
the
state
is
not
antithetical
to
the
notion
that
it
collect
the
money
belonging
to
the
consumers
in
the
capacity
as
trustee
and
setup
the
necessary
machinery
to
permit
those
people
who
actually
want
the
money
to
make
a
claim
against
the
attorney
general.
but
what
we
do
say,
in
response
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
are
other
means
available
to
redress
the
wrong
standard,
we
do
say
is
that
the
federal
judiciary
particularly
at
this
stage
in
life
ought
not
to
be
burdened
by
the
problems
of
it
administering
a
fund
as
is
now
being
done
in
the
collection
of
these
cases
under
the
antitrust
laws.
cases
that
are
presented
here
for
appeal,
for
example,
in
the
antibiotic
litigation,
which
this
court,
the
court
of
appeals
and
district
courts
have
been
burdened
for
three
years
even
though
they
are
theoretically
settled.
this
is
a
matter,
i
submit
to
you
that
ought
to
be
resolved
between
the
state
and
its
government
and
the
consumers,
ought
not
to
be
burdened
upon
the
courts
with
notice
requirements
and
the
administration
of
funds
and
that
sort
of
thing.
so
that
the
suggestion
that
is
implicit
by
the
respondents
that
the
class
action
is
really
the
appropriate
means
of
redressing
this
kind
of
case
and
to
dissent
the
claim
which
the
state
ought
to
assert,
is
i
respectfully
suggest
window
dressed.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
yes
it
does,
mr.
justice
white.
it
has
an
antitrust
law
fashioned
almost
verbatim
after
the
sherman
act.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
as
far
as
i
know,
it
is
open
to
the
state.
i
would
assume
that
the
federal
precedence
by
statute
had
to
apply
in
hawaii
and
since
that
state
is
the
state
for
federal
--
a
person
for
federal
purposes
i
assume
it
must
be
for
state
purposes
as
well.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
yes,
i
believe
it
does.
i
think
it
is
patent
almost
precisely
and
verbatim
after
the
sherman
act
and
applicable
portions
of
the
clayton
act.
even,
addressing
ourself
back
to
the
question
of
damages,
even
if
the
total
overcharge
were
not
the
gravament
of
the
complaint
and
even
if
the
state
of
hawaii
were
for
some
reason
not
entitled
to
that.0
the
ninth
circuit,
i
respectfully
submit
erred,
when
it
said
that
the
impact
to
the
general
economic
welfare
of
the
state
was
not
in
this
sophisticated
day
and
age
capable
of
reasonably
precise
computation
or
measurement.
i
submit
that
today,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
in
an
article
in
the
columbia
journal
of
law
and
sociology.
there
has
been
discussion
which
would
permit
the
quantification
of
damages
just
to
the
injury
to
the
economy
or
welfare
of
the
state
and
i
also
submit
that
in
a
more
recent
article
which
we
have
not
had
time
to
say
it
by
an
eminent
professor
of
economics,
he
concurs
in
this
solution
that
there
are
ways
and
methods
by
which
economic
testimony,
economic
analysis
can
quantify
the
impact
to
a
state
on
its
economy
or
general
welfare
resulting
from
a
pervasive
antitrust
price-fixing
violation.
now,
i
respectfully
submit
here
that
there
are
no
other
means
that
are
practicably
available
for
the
redress
of
this
grievance.
and
that
is
illustrated,
i
submit
to
you,
by
the
fact
that
in
the
fourth
amended
complaint
in
file
as
count
three,
the
plaintiff
here,
the
state
of
hawaii
had
a
class
action
seeking
damages
under
the
antitrust
laws
as
representative
of
the
consumers
of
the
state
of
hawaii
as
a
result
of
this
pervasive
overcharge.
as
the
respondents
now
come
before
the
court
and
tell
you
that
there
are
other
and
better
means
available
for
the
adjudication
of
this
kind
of
controversy
who
opposed
the
maintenance
of
that
class
successfully
and
persuaded
the
district
judge
as
he
put
it
that
the
class
was
unmanageable.
it
is
the
same
industry
and
at
least
one
defendant
of
the
group
that
stands
before
you,
who
persuaded
judge
augelli
recently
in
the
district
court
of
new
jersey
that
a
consumer
class
action
involving
overcharges
in
the
oil
industry
was
unmanageable.
and
i
respectfully
submit
to
you
that
unless
the
decision
in
georgia
is
reaffirmed
and
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
and
states
are
permitted
to
seek
the
redress
of
damages
for
pervasive
violations
to
the
consumers,
these
violations
will
go
un-redressed.
the
violators
will
be
permitted
to
retain
the
fruits
of
their
conspiracy
and
the
thrust
of
antitrust
enforcement
substantially
diminished
and
for
those
reasons
we
respectfully
argue
to
reverse
the
ninth
circuit's
judgment.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
respondent’s
suggestion
that
the
georgia
case
did
not
dispose
off
this
because
the
claim
for
damages
in
the
georgia
case
was
solely
with
respect
to
georgia’s
own
railroads,
its
proprietary
interest
as
a
respectfully
submit
it,
clearly
refuted
by
the
language
of
the
court
itself.
and
majority
opinion
holding
as
it
did
that
georgia
may
maintain
this
sued
as
parens
patriae
acting
on
behalf
of
her
citizens
was
the
language
of
the
holding.
and
in
making
that
holding
the
very
next
phrase
is
we
treat
the
injury
to
the
state
as
proprietor
merely
as
make
weight.
so
it
seems
perfectly
clear
when
you
read
the
allegations
of
the
georgia
petition
that
they
alleged
one
total
injury
to
the
economy,
to
the
citizenry
of
the
state.
and
then
reaching
that
analysis,
i
think,
it
perfectly
obvious
that
a
state
is
for
purposes
of
bringing
a
parens
patriae
lawsuit,
whether
it
be
injunction
or
damages,
nothing
more
than
the
aggregation
of
its
people
which
as
mr.
justice
white
points
out
when
world
together
is
called
the
economy
or
welfare
of
the
community.
it
perfectly
obvious,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
georgia
case
said
that
that
total
controversy
rose
above
the
question
of
a
mere
local
or
private
right.
and
that
georgia
acting
on
behalf
of
its
people
was
entitled
to
litigate
the
question
of
recovery
of
damages,
parens
patriae
in
addition
to
the
claim
for
injunctive
relief.
and
carrying
that
to
its
logical
extension,
if
as
respondents
contend,
the
parens
patriae
doctrine
is
totally
unnecessary
because
the
sweep
of
clayton
16
is
sufficiently
broad
to
permit
suits
for
injunctive
relief
wholly
apart
from
the
doctrine
of
parens
patriae,
then
i
respectfully
submit
the
entire
question
presented
to
this
court
in
georgia
was
futile.
it
is
a
waste
of
the
court’s
time
to
present
to
it
an
issue
as
to
whether
a
justiciable
controversy
existed
because
the
question
litigated
in
georgia
is
whether
that
ball
of
wax,
that
economy,
that
general
interest
of
the
state,
constituted
a
property
right
capable
of
protection
by
both
damage
relief
and
injunctive
relief.
and
if
there
has
been
an
injury,
if
there
has
been
an
injury
to
the
state
that
permits
it
to
acquire
injunctive
relief.
then
as
i
pointed
out
in
our
opening,
it
seems
to
me
we
have
long
passed
that
day
where
that
injury
is
not
susceptible
of
some
reasonable
monetary
estimate
for
purposes
of
recovering
damages.
and
the
starting
point
has
to
be,
the
overcharge
to
the
consumers
as
a
whole.
now,
for
these
reasons,
we
think
that
the
ninth
circuit’s
opinion
must
be
reversed.
and
let
me
leave
you
with
this
final
thought
if
i
may,
while
it
is
true
that
there
are
a
large
number
of
antitrust
cases
as
mr.
kirham
correctly
points
out
pending
in
the
district
courts,
most
of
them
are
the
result
of
singular
type
litigation
following
government
complaints
and
indictment.
and
the
impact
on
the
courts
in
those
cases
is
going
to
be
substantially
reduced
i
submit
by
permitting,
instead
of
the
aggregate
number
of
cases,
a
single
case
by
a
state
through
generally
an
elected
or
appointed
responsible
official
to
recover
damages
for
a
pervasive
price-fixing
agreement.
and
while
the
respondents
had
many
technical
legal
arguments
which
are
designed
to
preclude
the
recovery
by
the
state
in
a
case
such
as
this,
they
have
not
answered
the
question
which
i
say
to
you
is
of
singular
importance.
and
that
is
mr.
justices,
what
happens
to
the
money,
they
have
acquired
as
a
result
of
this
illegal
conduct.
if
you
follow
the
path
they
have
chartered
for
you,
they
retain
it,
in
the
antitrust
enforcement
and
this
bill
of
rights
to
which
mr.
kirham
refers
suffer
enormously.
i
say
the
case
price
for
reversal.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
i
say
it
is
separate.
i
think
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
yes.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
i
think
that
would
--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
i
think
that
would
depend
upon
a
clarification
of
georgia
that
this
court
would
be
required
to
make
and
consistently
mr.
justice
--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
i
would
think
that
the
appropriate
mechanism
would
be
for
the
state
to
recover
the
money,
to
keep
it
and
assume
that
the
citizens
are
benefited
by
the
return
of
the
money
to
the
state.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
right.
on
the
other
hand
--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
in
one
form
or
another.
but
recognizing
the
problems
that
might
be
present
by
the
first
approach,
as
i
suggested
to
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
state
is
not
antithetical
to
the
view
that
it
recover
under
what
we
think
is
the
alternate,
parens
patriae
approach.
and
that
is
recovered
as
trustee
with
an
obligation
imposed
upon
it
to
return
the
money
to
those
people
who
can
present
an
appropriate
claim
through
the
machinations
of
state
or
mechanics
of
state
government.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
no.
no,
i
would
not
say
that
mr.
white.
under
the
second,
theory
clearly
it
recovers
the
citizen’s
money.
under
the
first
i
think
that
one
of
the
measurements
of
the
impact
upon
the
economy
of
the
state
or
upon
its
general
welfare
has
to
be
the
total
overcharge
to
the
people
and
so
i
take
it
--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
not
under
the
first
approach
--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
no,
i
–
then
i
misspoke
--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
that
is
correct
and
that
is
what
judge
pence
held
in
this
case.
that
is
what
the
district
court
held.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
may
please
the
court.
the
basic
issue
presented
by
this
appeal
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
ninth
circuit
is
whether
the
claim
of
a
state
parens
patriae
for
damages
under
the
antitrust
laws
presents
a
justiciable
controversy.
at
page
11
of
their
brief,
the
respondents
assert
that
we
are
asking
the
court
as
they
dramatically
put
in
“to
boldly
create
new
law”.
and
while
i
suppose
most
lawyers
appearing
before
this
aghast
body
would
like
in
some
measure
to
be
the
architect
of
some
new
jurisprudential
principle.
i
must
respectfully
submit
to
you
that
it
is
the
respondents
in
asking
you
to
affirm
what
we
regard
to
be
the
erroneous
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
who
in
fact
asked
you
to
make
new
law
by
overruling
the
established
law
made
by
this
court.
to
submit
to
the
court
that
under
two
separate
sets
of
precedents
and
analysis,
reversal
of
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
is
required.
and
to
begin
with
the
case
of
this
court
in
1945
in
state
of
georgia
versus
pennsylvania
railroad,
is
i
submit
dispositive
of
the
issue
framed
by
this
appeal.
in
that
case,
the
court
dealt
with
precisely
the
same
question
laid
before
it
here.
namely,
whether
a
justiciable
controversy
existed
by
the
claim
of
the
state
of
georgia
for
both
damages
and
injunctive
relief
alleged
parens
patriae
based
on
violations
of
the
antitrust
laws
in
the
railroad
industry.
and
while
this
court
in
holding
that
such
a
justiciable
controversy
was
presented
in
permitting
the
state
of
georgia
to
file
an
original
complaint
in
this
court.
ultimately
concluded
that
its
prior
holding
in
keogh
versus
chicago
and
northwestern
railroad
presented
an
impediment
of
the
collection
of
damages,
i
respectfully
submit
and
i
think
it
patently
obvious
that
the
interdiction
of
that
defense
is
completely
unrelated
to
the
standing
question
presented
by
this
appeal
and
is
no
more
relevant
than
if
the
claim
for
damages
would
have
been
barred
for
example,
by
the
statute
of
limitations
by
release,
by
res
judicata
or
by
some
other
substantive
legal
defense.
the
court
in
fact
dealt
with
the
same
question
whether
or
not
the
claim
could
be
perfected
in
equity
under
section
16
of
the
clayton
act
which
the
court
will
recall
interdicts
private
parties
from
securing
injunctive
relief
on
subject
matters
which
are
under
the
jurisdiction,
regulatory
jurisdiction
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
in
that
case
the
court
went
on
to
hold
that
section
16
did
not
interdict
georgia’s
claim
parens
patriae
for
equitable
relief.
but
the
basic
holding
remains
unimpaired,
the
district
court
found
that
the
georgia
case
was
dispositive
and
that
this
court
had
ruled
in
georgia
that
a
justiciable
controversy
is
presented
by
reason
of
a
section
for
a
claim
for
damages
parens
patriae
under
the
antitrust
laws
brought
by
a
state.
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
underpinning
of
georgia
is
the
recognition
by
this
court
that
section
4
of
the
clayton
act
which
permits
treble
damages
and
section
16
of
the
clayton
act
which
permits
equitable
relief
are
coextensive.
a
concept
expressly
articulated
later
by
this
court
in
its
first
decision
in
zenith
versus
hazeltine
in
1969
which
recognized
the
fact
that
the
two
statutes
afford
different
remedies
for
the
invasion
of
a
property
rights.
section
4
permits
damages
and
section
16
permits
injunctive
relief
against
threat
and
future
injury.
in
the
georgia
case,
it
must
be
clear
therefore
that
the
court
made
a
valued
judgment
and
said
that
the
interest
of
a
state
in
the
protection
of
its
general
economy
against
invasion,
constituted
a
property
right
capable
of
protection
and
capable
of
redress
under
the
antitrust
laws.
so
we
say
to
you
as
we
said
to
the
district
judge
that
where
conduct
violative
of
the
antitrust
laws
affects
the
general
welfare
of
the
state,
where
there
is
an
alleged
price-fixing
conspiracy
which
on
the
record
before
us,
we
must
accept
is
factually
supportive.
where
there
is
a
pervasive
price-fixing
conspiracy
affecting
a
large
number
of
consumers,
that
this
kind
of
controversy
which
affects
the
general
welfare
and
economy
of
a
state
rises
above
the
question
of
local
private
rights
and
involves
a
matter
of
state
interest
such
that
it
raises
a
property
interest
under
section
4
of
the
clayton
act
or
section
16
of
the
clayton
act
which
is
protected
parens
patriae
by
an
action
by
the
state.
now,
we
submit
here
that
it
is
unnecessary
to
reexamine
the
rationale
of
the
georgia
versus
pennsylvania
railroads
analysis.
we
would
contend
that
the
majority
opinion
of
mr.
justice
douglas
and
the
dissent
of
mr.
justice
stone
adequately
exhaust
the
merits
of
the
respected
positions
which
could
be
articulated
in
respect
to
whether
or
not
a
state
parens
patriae
can
make
a
claim
for
damages
under
the
antitrust
laws,
where
there
has
been
an
extensive
injury
to
the
consumers
of
the
state
by
reason
of
a
pervasive
antitrust
violation.
we
asked
only
that
the
court
here
reversed
the
error
of
the
ninth
circuit
in
holding
that
the
georgia
case
did
not
dispose
of
the
present
claim
in
to
district
court.
and
in
saying
that
we
urge
upon
you
that
as
respondents
who
are
here
before
you
in
effect
suggesting
that
you
repeal
the
decision
in
georgia
which
has
remained
unimpaired
for
more
than
25
years.
i
further
respectfully
submit
to
you
that
even
absent
of
decision
in
georgia
versus
pennsylvania
railroad.
this
court
and
the
basis
of
prior
precedence
would
not
be
charging
any
new
jurisprudential
ground
were
to
affirm
the
holding
of
the
district
court
and
reverse
the
ninth
circuit.
recall
in
the
case
of
j.i
case
company
versus
borak,
this
court
said
that
it
is
the
duty
of
the
courts
to
provide
such
remedies,
as
are
necessary
to
make
effective
a
congressional
purpose.
and
that
where
legal
rights
have
been
invaded
and
a
federal
statute
provides
for
a
general
right
to
sue
for
such
invasion,
federal
courts
may
use
any
available
remedy
to
make
good
the
wrong
done.
recently,
in
this
year,
the
court
again
in
the
case
of
bivens
versus
narcotics
agents,
citing
the
borak
case
concluded
that
it
was
the
responsibility
of
the
federal
judiciary
to
create
a
remedy,
to
write
a
wrong
where
an
act
of
congress
interdicted
specific
unlawful
conduct.
now,
how
do
those
decisions
apply
even
absent
the
georgia
precedent
to
this
particular
case?
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
they
ought
to
be
predicated
against
this
court's
statement
in
hanover
shoe
versus
united
shoe
machinery,
that
the
high
purpose
of
antitrust
enforcement
is
best
served
by
permitting
private
treble
damage
actions
as
an
effective
deterrent
to
violations
of
the
law.
and
as
this
court
recognized
in
hanover
that
any
holding
which
retains,
which
permits
a
group
of
antitrust
violators
to
retain
the
fruit
of
their
illegal
conduct
because
no
effective
suit
could
be
brought
against
them.
any
such
holding,
i
suggest
respectfully
must
undermine
the
effective
law
enforcement
through
treble
damage
litigation.
so
if
we
take
the
principles
of
borak
as
reaffirmed
earlier
this
year
in
the
bivens
case
against
the
background
of
the
judicial
and
legislative
purpose
to
be
served
by
treble
damage
litigation,
i
respectfully
submit
that
that
series
of
precedence
would
require
this
court
to
affirm
the
district
court.
and
here
again,
we
submit
to
you
that
it
is
the
respondents
and
not
the
appellant
who
ask
you
to
ignore
established
precedence
in
affirming
the
ninth
circuit
decision.
i
think
little
need
to
be
said
with
respect
to
the
subject
matter
of
damages
which
also
formed
in
part
a
basis
of
the
ninth
circuit’s
reversal
of
the
district
court’s
decision.
i
would
respectfully
characterize
the
holding
of
ninth
circuit
and
that
respect
is
antediluvian.
as
long
ago
we
passed
the
stage
in
the
development
of
antitrust
or
any
law
where
wrong
doers
are
permitted
to
retain
the
fruits
of
illegal
conduct
simply
because
there
is
some
difficulty
or
lack
of
precision
in
the
measurement
of
damages.
in
bigelow
versus
rko
in
1946,
this
court
made
that
principle
perfectly
clear
in
antitrust
law
and
it
is
finally
seeping
down
to
the
level
of
the
district
courts
and
the
courts
of
appeal.
the
gravament
of
this
charge
is
presented
by
the
state
and
the
district
court
is
that
it
is
entitled.
it
is
entitled
to
recover
the
overcharge
by
reason
of
the
price
fix
imposed
upon
the
consumers
of
the
state.
and
that
mathematical
computation
is
capable
i
submit
to
you
of
almost
precise
measurement,
the
first
mistake
that
permeates
to
court
of
appeal’s
determination
that
the
damages
in
this
case
are
simply
too
remote
and
speculative
to
be
measured.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
we
presented
the
court,
mr.
justice
stewart,
with
alternative
views
on
that.
it
is
essentially
a
matter
of
indifference
to
the
state
of
hawaii
except
that
the
administrative
burdens
would
be
substantially
reduced
if
your
hypothetical
were
correct,
that
the
money
belonged
to
the
state
and
in
effect
belonged
to
the
citizens
only
because
the
state
had
it
available
for
uses
which
would
reduce
the
tax
burden
of
its
citizens.
on
the
other
hand,
the
state
is
not
antithetical
to
the
notion
that
it
collect
the
money
belonging
to
the
consumers
in
the
capacity
as
trustee
and
setup
the
necessary
machinery
to
permit
those
people
who
actually
want
the
money
to
make
a
claim
against
the
attorney
general.
but
what
we
do
say,
in
response
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
are
other
means
available
to
redress
the
wrong
standard,
we
do
say
is
that
the
federal
judiciary
particularly
at
this
stage
in
life
ought
not
to
be
burdened
by
the
problems
of
it
administering
a
fund
as
is
now
being
done
in
the
collection
of
these
cases
under
the
antitrust
laws.
cases
that
are
presented
here
for
appeal,
for
example,
in
the
antibiotic
litigation,
which
this
court,
the
court
of
appeals
and
district
courts
have
been
burdened
for
three
years
even
though
they
are
theoretically
settled.
this
is
a
matter,
i
submit
to
you
that
ought
to
be
resolved
between
the
state
and
its
government
and
the
consumers,
ought
not
to
be
burdened
upon
the
courts
with
notice
requirements
and
the
administration
of
funds
and
that
sort
of
thing.
so
that
the
suggestion
that
is
implicit
by
the
respondents
that
the
class
action
is
really
the
appropriate
means
of
redressing
this
kind
of
case
and
to
dissent
the
claim
which
the
state
ought
to
assert,
is
i
respectfully
suggest
window
dressed.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
yes
it
does,
mr.
justice
white.
it
has
an
antitrust
law
fashioned
almost
verbatim
after
the
sherman
act.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
as
far
as
i
know,
it
is
open
to
the
state.
i
would
assume
that
the
federal
precedence
by
statute
had
to
apply
in
hawaii
and
since
that
state
is
the
state
for
federal
--
a
person
for
federal
purposes
i
assume
it
must
be
for
state
purposes
as
well.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
yes,
i
believe
it
does.
i
think
it
is
patent
almost
precisely
and
verbatim
after
the
sherman
act
and
applicable
portions
of
the
clayton
act.
even,
addressing
ourself
back
to
the
question
of
damages,
even
if
the
total
overcharge
were
not
the
gravament
of
the
complaint
and
even
if
the
state
of
hawaii
were
for
some
reason
not
entitled
to
that.0
the
ninth
circuit,
i
respectfully
submit
erred,
when
it
said
that
the
impact
to
the
general
economic
welfare
of
the
state
was
not
in
this
sophisticated
day
and
age
capable
of
reasonably
precise
computation
or
measurement.
i
submit
that
today,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
in
an
article
in
the
columbia
journal
of
law
and
sociology.
there
has
been
discussion
which
would
permit
the
quantification
of
damages
just
to
the
injury
to
the
economy
or
welfare
of
the
state
and
i
also
submit
that
in
a
more
recent
article
which
we
have
not
had
time
to
say
it
by
an
eminent
professor
of
economics,
he
concurs
in
this
solution
that
there
are
ways
and
methods
by
which
economic
testimony,
economic
analysis
can
quantify
the
impact
to
a
state
on
its
economy
or
general
welfare
resulting
from
a
pervasive
antitrust
price-fixing
violation.
now,
i
respectfully
submit
here
that
there
are
no
other
means
that
are
practicably
available
for
the
redress
of
this
grievance.
and
that
is
illustrated,
i
submit
to
you,
by
the
fact
that
in
the
fourth
amended
complaint
in
file
as
count
three,
the
plaintiff
here,
the
state
of
hawaii
had
a
class
action
seeking
damages
under
the
antitrust
laws
as
representative
of
the
consumers
of
the
state
of
hawaii
as
a
result
of
this
pervasive
overcharge.
as
the
respondents
now
come
before
the
court
and
tell
you
that
there
are
other
and
better
means
available
for
the
adjudication
of
this
kind
of
controversy
who
opposed
the
maintenance
of
that
class
successfully
and
persuaded
the
district
judge
as
he
put
it
that
the
class
was
unmanageable.
it
is
the
same
industry
and
at
least
one
defendant
of
the
group
that
stands
before
you,
who
persuaded
judge
augelli
recently
in
the
district
court
of
new
jersey
that
a
consumer
class
action
involving
overcharges
in
the
oil
industry
was
unmanageable.
and
i
respectfully
submit
to
you
that
unless
the
decision
in
georgia
is
reaffirmed
and
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
and
states
are
permitted
to
seek
the
redress
of
damages
for
pervasive
violations
to
the
consumers,
these
violations
will
go
un-redressed.
the
violators
will
be
permitted
to
retain
the
fruits
of
their
conspiracy
and
the
thrust
of
antitrust
enforcement
substantially
diminished
and
for
those
reasons
we
respectfully
argue
to
reverse
the
ninth
circuit's
judgment.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
respondent’s
suggestion
that
the
georgia
case
did
not
dispose
off
this
because
the
claim
for
damages
in
the
georgia
case
was
solely
with
respect
to
georgia’s
own
railroads,
its
proprietary
interest
as
a
respectfully
submit
it,
clearly
refuted
by
the
language
of
the
court
itself.
and
majority
opinion
holding
as
it
did
that
georgia
may
maintain
this
sued
as
parens
patriae
acting
on
behalf
of
her
citizens
was
the
language
of
the
holding.
and
in
making
that
holding
the
very
next
phrase
is
we
treat
the
injury
to
the
state
as
proprietor
merely
as
make
weight.
so
it
seems
perfectly
clear
when
you
read
the
allegations
of
the
georgia
petition
that
they
alleged
one
total
injury
to
the
economy,
to
the
citizenry
of
the
state.
and
then
reaching
that
analysis,
i
think,
it
perfectly
obvious
that
a
state
is
for
purposes
of
bringing
a
parens
patriae
lawsuit,
whether
it
be
injunction
or
damages,
nothing
more
than
the
aggregation
of
its
people
which
as
mr.
justice
white
points
out
when
world
together
is
called
the
economy
or
welfare
of
the
community.
it
perfectly
obvious,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
georgia
case
said
that
that
total
controversy
rose
above
the
question
of
a
mere
local
or
private
right.
and
that
georgia
acting
on
behalf
of
its
people
was
entitled
to
litigate
the
question
of
recovery
of
damages,
parens
patriae
in
addition
to
the
claim
for
injunctive
relief.
and
carrying
that
to
its
logical
extension,
if
as
respondents
contend,
the
parens
patriae
doctrine
is
totally
unnecessary
because
the
sweep
of
clayton
16
is
sufficiently
broad
to
permit
suits
for
injunctive
relief
wholly
apart
from
the
doctrine
of
parens
patriae,
then
i
respectfully
submit
the
entire
question
presented
to
this
court
in
georgia
was
futile.
it
is
a
waste
of
the
court’s
time
to
present
to
it
an
issue
as
to
whether
a
justiciable
controversy
existed
because
the
question
litigated
in
georgia
is
whether
that
ball
of
wax,
that
economy,
that
general
interest
of
the
state,
constituted
a
property
right
capable
of
protection
by
both
damage
relief
and
injunctive
relief.
and
if
there
has
been
an
injury,
if
there
has
been
an
injury
to
the
state
that
permits
it
to
acquire
injunctive
relief.
then
as
i
pointed
out
in
our
opening,
it
seems
to
me
we
have
long
passed
that
day
where
that
injury
is
not
susceptible
of
some
reasonable
monetary
estimate
for
purposes
of
recovering
damages.
and
the
starting
point
has
to
be,
the
overcharge
to
the
consumers
as
a
whole.
now,
for
these
reasons,
we
think
that
the
ninth
circuit’s
opinion
must
be
reversed.
and
let
me
leave
you
with
this
final
thought
if
i
may,
while
it
is
true
that
there
are
a
large
number
of
antitrust
cases
as
mr.
kirham
correctly
points
out
pending
in
the
district
courts,
most
of
them
are
the
result
of
singular
type
litigation
following
government
complaints
and
indictment.
and
the
impact
on
the
courts
in
those
cases
is
going
to
be
substantially
reduced
i
submit
by
permitting,
instead
of
the
aggregate
number
of
cases,
a
single
case
by
a
state
through
generally
an
elected
or
appointed
responsible
official
to
recover
damages
for
a
pervasive
price-fixing
agreement.
and
while
the
respondents
had
many
technical
legal
arguments
which
are
designed
to
preclude
the
recovery
by
the
state
in
a
case
such
as
this,
they
have
not
answered
the
question
which
i
say
to
you
is
of
singular
importance.
and
that
is
mr.
justices,
what
happens
to
the
money,
they
have
acquired
as
a
result
of
this
illegal
conduct.
if
you
follow
the
path
they
have
chartered
for
you,
they
retain
it,
in
the
antitrust
enforcement
and
this
bill
of
rights
to
which
mr.
kirham
refers
suffer
enormously.
i
say
the
case
price
for
reversal.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
i
say
it
is
separate.
i
think
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
yes.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
i
think
that
would
--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
i
think
that
would
depend
upon
a
clarification
of
georgia
that
this
court
would
be
required
to
make
and
consistently
mr.
justice
--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
i
would
think
that
the
appropriate
mechanism
would
be
for
the
state
to
recover
the
money,
to
keep
it
and
assume
that
the
citizens
are
benefited
by
the
return
of
the
money
to
the
state.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
right.
on
the
other
hand
--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
in
one
form
or
another.
but
recognizing
the
problems
that
might
be
present
by
the
first
approach,
as
i
suggested
to
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
state
is
not
antithetical
to
the
view
that
it
recover
under
what
we
think
is
the
alternate,
parens
patriae
approach.
and
that
is
recovered
as
trustee
with
an
obligation
imposed
upon
it
to
return
the
money
to
those
people
who
can
present
an
appropriate
claim
through
the
machinations
of
state
or
mechanics
of
state
government.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
no.
no,
i
would
not
say
that
mr.
white.
under
the
second,
theory
clearly
it
recovers
the
citizen’s
money.
under
the
first
i
think
that
one
of
the
measurements
of
the
impact
upon
the
economy
of
the
state
or
upon
its
general
welfare
has
to
be
the
total
overcharge
to
the
people
and
so
i
take
it
--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
not
under
the
first
approach
--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
no,
i
–
then
i
misspoke
--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
that
is
correct
and
that
is
what
judge
pence
held
in
this
case.
that
is
what
the
district
court
held.
