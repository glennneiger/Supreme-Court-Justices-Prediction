mr.
richard
g.
bell
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
pick
up
if
i
may
at
precisely
the
point
where
my
brother
mr.
lesser
left
off
and
that
is
posing
the
question
as
to
whether
congress
intended
these
claims
to
have
been
heard
by
the
three-judge
district
court
below.
the
basic
holding
of
the
lower
court
was
that
it
did
not
have
subject
matter
jurisdiction
under
the
section
1343
and
that
was
the
basis
of
its
dismissal.
now,
the
appellees’
position
on
the
1343
jurisdictional
question
rests
squarely
upon
the
doctrine
annunciated
in
the
eisen
case
which
in
turn
goes
back
to
the
postulation
by
mr.
justice
stone
in
the
hague
decision
as
to
the
relation
between
1343
and
1331.
i
would
like
to
review
that
because
that
is
the
basis
of
our
position
and
the
basis
of
the
lower
court’s
dismissal
below.
now
the
appellants
have
a
direct
argument
and
an
appealing
argument
as
to
why
this
is
not
so
and
they
say
basically
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
enacted
with
the
purpose
in
mind
to
protect
precisely
the
kind
of
right
that
is
involved
in
this
case.
further,
that
section
1343
and
section
1983,
the
statute
created
the
cause
of
action
were
designed
to
pick
up
those
constitutional
rights
and
to
provide
a
cause
of
action
and
jurisdiction
to
secure
them.
finally,
the
appellants
say
that
section
1331,
a
$10,000
jurisdictional
statute,
is
to
be
looked
apart
--
looked
upon
as
separate
and
apart
from
and
distinct
from
the
1343
and
1983
propositions.
now,
if
the
matter
were
as
clear
as
this
from
the
legislative
history,
the
wonder
is
really
that
mr.
justice
stone
had
to
go
through
its
process
of
reasoning
in
the
hague
decision
at
all.
and
the
answer
must
be
simply
that
a
selective
choice
of
the
legislative
history
is
simply
not
as
clear
and
not
as
precise
and
not
as
symmetrical
as
the
appellants
would
have
it.
i
believe
that
the
reason
for
this
really
is
that
what
you
overlook
in
establishing
that
kind
of
precise
intent
to
a
portion
of
the
civil
rights
legislation
is
the
nature
of
the
process
that
went
on
in
congress
for
the
period
following
the
civil
war.
in
mr.
justice
frankfurter’s
words,
“this
were
years
of
struggle
and
of
compromise.”
and
to
reduce
a
portion
of
the
legislative
result
to
clarity
and
direct
us
in
simplicity
overlooks
the
nature
of
that
struggle
and
it
overlooks
the
triumphs
and
the
defeats
of
that
compromising
process
and
it
overlooks
the
intensity
of
the
passions
that
were
involved,
thus
the
post
civil
war
congress
has
tried
to
hammer
out
in
lasting
terms
what
it
was
that
it
had
torn
a
country
apart
for
five
years
during
the
civil
war.
now,
i
think
it
is
instructive
to
review
the
period
that
is
in
question
while
this
legislative
history
accumulates.
we
begin
in
1865
with
the
thirteenth
amendment
itself
which
the
court’s
emancipation.
in
1866,
we
have
the
first
of
the
civil
rights
act.
that
was
the
act
which,
among
other
things,
included
what
is
today
section
1983,
that
statute
dealing
with
equal
rights
as
to
ownership
and
as
to
disposition
of
property.
and
there
is
evidence
from
the
history
as
suggested
in
our
brief
that
1983
was
the
keystone
of
the
reconstruction
of
congress’
efforts
to
preserve
that
kind
of
property
right.
in
1868
the
fourteenth
amendment
himself,
in
1870
there
is
another
civil
rights
act
and
the
fifteenth
amendment
dealing
with
voting
rights
comes
in
to
being.
in
1871,
there
are
two
civil
rights
act
that
came
on
the
books
and
one
of
them
is
so
called
ku
klux
klan
act
of
1871
from
whence
the
present
day
1983
statute
creating
a
cause
of
action
and
the
1343
jurisdictional
statute
draw.
now,
there
is
evidence
in
the
history
that
what
was
a
paramount
concern
of
this
ku
klux
klan
act
of
1871
was
the
unequal
treatment
of
people,
evidenced
by
the
clan
activity
in
the
south
from
whence
the
act
took
its
name.
the
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race,
the
denial
of
equal
opportunities
and
the
denial
of
the
equal
applications
of
the
laws
in
the
years
following
the
civil
war.
finally,
the
last
stage
in
this
legislative
history
in
1875
is
the
first
emergence
of
section
1331,
the
jurisdictional
statute
which
now
deals
in
terms
of
$10,000,
but
at
the
time
of
the
original
passage
i
believe
it
was
a
$500
statute.
there
is
pause
in
1875
and
there
is
a
recodification
that
takes
place
in
that
year
and
some
adjustments
were
made
to
the
statute
that
had
preceded
it.
for
instance,
i
believe
it
is
at
that
time
that
the
statement
in
1983
dealing
with
a
cause
of
action
based
on
federal
laws
as
well
as
the
constitution
first
comes
in
to
being
in
1875.
the
jurisdictional
statute
1343
includes
at
that
time
a
statement
with
respect
to
causes
of
action
based
on
federal
laws
denying
equal
rights
and
expressed
records
to
the
kind
of
equality
concerned
that
it
was
at
the
heart
of
the
civil
rights
legislation.
now
what
mr.
justice
stone’s
formulation
in
hague
case
does
is
set
the
year
1875
as
the
point
of
departure
from
whence
both
1343
and
1331
have
existed
on
the
books
side
by
side
down
to
the
time
of
the
hague
decision,
which
was
in
1939.
excuse
me,
there
was
one
legislative
activity
during
that
period
but
not
of
tremendous
significance,
that
was
in
1911
recodification
when
the
jurisdiction
of
the
circuit
courts
and
the
district
court
became
merged
in
the
district
court
and
1343,
the
jurisdictional
statute,
preserved
the
phrase
that
it
has
today
dealing
with
jurisdiction
to
causes
under
those
federal
laws
providing
for
equal
rights.
now,
what
mr.
justice
stone
saw
from
the
history
that
he
looked
up
in
its
entirety
and
as
a
whole
were
these
two
parallel
statutes:
one
providing
a
cause
of
action
under
section
1343
with
no
monetary
allocations
or
no
monetary
requirement
whatsoever,
and
the
parallel
statute
1331
which
did
in
fact
have
a
monetary
requirement
which
is,
as
i
have
said
before,
has
been
changed
throughout
during
the
course
of
the
year.
now
his
analysis
led
him
to
believe
that
1343,
that
jurisdictional
statute
which
is
at
issue
in
this
case,
was
the
one
intended
to
be
directed
at
those
causes
of
actions
which
were
essentially
denials
of
personal
rights,
and
those
causes
of
action
based
essentially
on
denial
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
law,
the
discriminatory
evils
which
the
reconstruction
congress
had
noted
in
the
ku
klux
klan
act
and
others.
1331
on
the
other
hand,
according
to
mr.
justice
stone’s
formulation,
was
that
statute
designed
to
pick
up
those
actions
which
were
essentially
of
a
property
nature
capable
of
being
measured
in
monetary
amounts.
now,
in
looking
back
at
this
history
his
feel
the
vision
was
not
entirely
uncluttered
or
unclear
because
he
had
the
precedents
performed
in
such
cases
as
the
pleasants
case,
greenhow
and
holt
against
indiana
which
were
cases
giving
some
attention
to
the
1343
question
and
those
cases
had
started
the
court
found
attack
consistent
with
mr.
justice
stone’s
formulation
to
the
effect
that
1343
was
a
statute
dealing
with
civil
rights,
1331,
the
statute
dealing
with
property
allegations
which
were
truly
property,
and
did
not
involve
those
rights
susceptible
of
being
measured
in
monetary
or
pecuniary
terms.
that
is
the
rationale
of
mr.
justice,
hague
lies
and
that
is
the
one
if
it
comes
to
rest
in
the
second
circuit
case
involving
eisen
which
was
judge
friendly’s
opinion
some
30
years
later,
i
believe
in
1969.
now,
in
the
eisen
decision,
judge
friendly
is
candid
and
frank
to
know
the
difficulty
with
the
hague
formulation,
because
it
was
30
years
previous
and
also
because
there
was
no
majority
opinion
in
the
case
and
that
judge
friendly
pointed
that
out
in
the
course
of
his
opinion.
however,
notwithstanding
what
he
termed
to
be
difficulties
with
it,
notwithstanding
some
self
confessed
uncertainty
as
he
explained
quite
expressedly
in
his
opinion.
he
found
that
the
formulation
had
three
specific
virtues.
he
sought
as
accounting
for
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court
that
is
prior
to
the
term
of
the
eisen
case
or
those
as
to
where
jurisdiction
had
been
granted
and
those
as
to
where
it
had
not
with
one
exception.
he
sought
as
harmonizing
the
parallel
relation
of
1343
and
1331
during
their
long
history
stemming
from
the
recodification
in
1875.
and
finally,
he
felt
convinced
in
the
eisen
opinion
that
this
rationale
of
mr.
justice
stone
preserved
in
1343
the
kind
of
case
that
was
at
the
heart
of
the
civil
rights
enactment,
i
believe
we
call
them
the
civil
war.
that
is
it
preserved.
those
causes
of
action
based
on
discrimination,
based
on
unequal
treatment,
based
on
denial
of
equal
opportunity
which
could
not
be
merged
with
money
which
not
lend
themselves
to
any
kind
of
property
analysis.
and
thus
the
eisen
decision
in
the
second
circuit
effectively
repeats
the
stone
analysis
and
gives
rise
to
these
--
the
separation
between
1343
and
1331
on
the
basis
of
whether
or
not
the
right
alleges
or
assorted
is
or
is
not
capable
of
monetary
evaluation
or
whether
it
is
one
of
those
intangible
rights
of
personal
liberty
which
is
not
so
capable
and
therefore
for
which
no
monetary
requirement
lies
within
the
statute.
now,
it
was
the
application
of
this
analysis.
that
is
of
the
eisen
rationale
based
on
mr.
justice
stone’s
rationale
that
was
at
the
heart
of
the
lower
court’s
dismissal
on
the
basis
of
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
now,
the
garnishment
process
in
connecticut
--
and
may
i
just
explain
that
the
garnishment
process
is
a
kind
of
attachment
and
mr.
justice
stewart
raised
this
question,
i
believe,
the
statute
itself
is
entitled
one
of
four
in
attachment,
and
garnishment
is
used
not
with
respect
to
that
statute
but
the
understanding
that
is
part
of
the
overall
attachment
pattern
in
the
state
of
connecticut.
but
--
mr.
richard
g.
bell
that
is
correct
your
honor.
if
we
look
at
the
attachment
statutes
as
a
whole
there
are
several
things
which
is
a
matter
of
fact
are
proscribed,
all
of
them
having
kind
of
a
common
thread
of
interest
which
reflects
a
legislative
concern
in
connecticut
for
those
kinds
of
property
which
come
closes
to
enabling
one
to
exist
and
enabling
one
to
operate
in
a
free
society.
you
cannot
attach
or
reach
your
garnish
wages
in
advance
with
an
action.
you
cannot
deal
with
household
or
personal
effects.
you
cannot
reach
the
tools
of
one’s
tree.
you
cannot
reach
an
automobile
without
a
court
order.
there
are
certain
kinds
of
action
wherein
attachment
of
any
nature
or
garnishment
or
otherwise
is
prohibited
before
suit.
there
were
classes
of
plaintiffs
as
to
whom
the
process
is
denied
in
advance
of
suit.
mr.
richard
g.
bell
no
--
mr.
richard
g.
bell
no,
if
the
garnishment
is
properly
effective
at
the
outset
of
suit
it
will
remain
pending
throughout
the
duration
of
the
suit.
so
its
time
limit
is
so
extensive
with
the
tendency
of
the
laws
of
itself.
mr.
richard
g.
bell
that
is
correct.
the
garnishment
would
continue
to
apply
during
the
pendency
of
that
action
and
until
the
--
within
a
certain
period
following
judgment
as
a
matter
of
fact
allowing
for
execution
on
that
garnish.
the
--
what
i
am
trying
to
make
though
is
that
the
process
from
the
beginning,
it
is
circumscribe,
with
respect
to
certain
classes
of
assets
and
certain
classes
of
suits
and
certain
classes
of
plaintiffs
for
whom
or
as
to
whom
the
process
is
simply
not
available.
now,
these
two
plaintiffs
in
the
basic
cases
below
had
money
claims
against
the
defendants.
one
sued
on
a
note
the
other
provided
a
writ.
they
were
prohibited
by
connecticut
statute
from
attaching
the
kinds
of
asset
or
seeking
to
garnish
the
kinds
of
assets
that
i
have
described.
that
is
wages
at
the
source,
automobiles
without
a
court
order,
necessarily
household,
personal
effects
or
tools
of
one’s
pre
tree.
they
were
permitted
to
garnish
to
reach
the
assets
not
in
the
hands
of
the
debtor
but
in
the
hands
of
a
third
party.
in
this
case
there
was
one
hand
of
savings
account
and
the
other
hand
a
checking
account,
essentially
a
debt
due
which
is
the
keyword
in
our
garnishment
statute
from
those
banking
institutions
to
the
defendants
in
question.
now
the
effect
of
doing
so
is
to
put
a
place,
a
conditional
lien,
on
that
asset
during
dependency
of
that
lawsuit.
once
that
is
done,
that
is
once
the
garnishment
process
is
effected
there
are
provisions
under
the
statute
whereby
the
defendants
can
come
in
directly
to
the
court
for
reduction,
for
a
bill
of
particulars
for
verification
of
the
claim,
for
a
substitution
of
bond.
and
that
does
not
rely
on
the
pendency
of
the
suit;
that
can
be
done
as
soon
as
the
garnishment
process
has
been
reached.
but
it
was
under
these
circumstances,
i.e.,
in
looking
at
debt
due
to
defendants
from
a
third
party
that
the
court
below
attempted
to
analyze
the
nature
of
the
interest
involved
and
found
it
to
be
essentially
a
property
interest,
i.e.,
is
one
measurable
by
money
since
the
accounts
in
question
were
fixed
amounts.
being
a
property,
interest
it
found
it
not
to
lie
within
the
1343
formulation
under
the
eisen
and
the
hague
rationales
and
being
merely
a
property
interest.
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
based
--
finding
itself
without
jurisdiction
was
based
on
implicit
assumption
that
would
be
subject
to
the
1331
jurisdictional
statute.
now,
there
was
no
alternative
holding
in
the
court
below
and
that
was
the
one
predicated
on
2283.
2283
being
the
anti-injunction
statute
which
proscribes
the
application
of
injunction
during
the
pendency
of
state
court
proceeding,
and
this
was
relied
upon
by
the
lower
court
as
an
alternative
holding
having
addressed
itself
to
the
jurisdictional
issue
first.
now,
the
purpose
and
the
policy
of
2283,
i
believe,
are
familiar.
the
statute
dates
from
1793
and
it
reflects
the
kind
of
sensitive
concern
for
state
proceedings
that
ought
to
be
had
by
the
federal
judicial
system
once
the
state
proceeding
or
once
the
state
system
has
been
set
in
motion.
it
was
a
matter
of
first
business
for
the
congress
of
united
states
to
establish
that
relation
between
the
two
judicial
processing.
now
the
connecticut
garnishment
statute
or
the
attachment
statute
with
which
we
are
dealing
with,
dates
of
almost
equal
vintage
as
a
matter
of
fact;
it
goes
back
to
the
beginning
of
the
state
of
connecticut
and
represents
a
scheme
that
has
been
in
effect
in
the
state
of
connecticut
during
its
judicial
history.
you
must
have
this
old
state
policy
and
a
venerable
federal
policy
now
in
focus
within
the
confines
of
section
2283,
the
anti-injunction
statute.
now,
the
question
becomes
whether
for
the
purposes
of
section
2283,
the
garnishment
arrangement
in
connecticut,
the
garnishment
machinery,
constitutes
proceedings
within
the
meaning
of
section
2283
as
to
which
the
federal
action
should
be
staid
during
the
pendency
of
the
state
case
and
the
state
proceedings.
mr.
richard
g.
bell
excuse
me.
mr.
richard
g.
bell
well,
it
involves
court
procedures
your
honor.
it
is
affected
that
is
to
--
mr.
richard
g.
bell
well,
and
that
it
invokes
the
utilization
of
statutory
procedures
in
court
or
attacking
the
garnishment,
if
that
is
desired
by
the
defendants.
mr.
richard
g.
bell
they
did
nothing,
i
believe.
mr.
richard
g.
bell
well,
that
bears
on
the
question
of
what
is
a
proceeding
under
2283.
it
is
true
that
the
garnishment
--
mr.
richard
g.
bell
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
our
position
that
that
is
a
proceeding
and
that
it
is
a
proceeding
--
mr.
richard
g.
bell
well,
the
concept
of
proceedings
in
2283
your
honor,
i
believe
takes
in
all
phases
of
a
lawsuit
and
it
takes
them
in
from
beginning
to
end.
there
is
a
hill
against
martin
decision
which
is
cited
--
mr.
richard
g.
bell
well,
he
needs
to
proceed
with
an
order
of
court
your
honor
at
the
upset
and
that
--
mr.
richard
g.
bell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
g.
bell
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
richard
g.
bell
for
automobiles
that
could
--
it
is
a
statute
as
proscribed.
mr.
richard
g.
bell
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
g.
bell
that
is
correct
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
g.
bell
well,
this
case
was
--
this
case
was
pending
at
the
time
the
federal
action
was
instituted.
that
is
the
basic
interest
--
mr.
richard
g.
bell
well,
they
are
not
seeking
to
enjoin
the
application
of
the
utilization
of
the
connecticut
statutes.
mr.
richard
g.
bell
that
is
correct.
they
are
seeking
to
join
the
application
--
mr.
richard
g.
bell
well,
i
think
that
is
the
question,
and
then
one
of
the
allegations
is
that
they
make
it
that
the
connecticut
courts
do
not
have
the
machinery
to
do
just
that.
mr.
richard
g.
bell
maybe
i
could
explain
it
this
way.
if
the
question
zeroes
in
on
exactly
what
proceedings
are
within
the
concept
of
2283,
i
would
suggest
this:
if
the
--
given
the
policy
of
2283
which
is
that
concern
for
the
relation
of
this
judicial
systems,
given
the
fact
that
the
question
as
a
matter
of
fact
as
to
constitutionality
is
an
open
question
in
the
connecticut
courts
and
given
the
language
of
prior
court
decision
here
in
hill
against
martin
i
would
suggest
that
is
proceedings.
the
hill
language
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter
suggested
that
the
concept
of
proceedings
for
2283
purposes
should
include
all
steps
and
all
phases
of
a
lawsuit
or
actions
by
ministerial
officers
of
the
court
including
else
which
are
directive
either
ancillary
or
supplementary
for
its
making
of
the
suit
or
the
judgment
effective.
and
i
would
say
that
that
concept
to
proceedings
dealing
with
the
whole
workings
of
the
judicial
processes
of
a
state
does
include
the
process
of
garnishment
and
does
include
the
process
of
attachment.
mr.
richard
g.
bell
i
believe
that
deputy
sheriff
in
service
was
appointed,
he
is
appointed,
i
believe,
by
a
sheriff
who
is
an
elected
official
if
i
am
not
mistaken,
i
believe
that
is
the
case.
mr.
richard
g.
bell
well,
he
is
a
--
he
is
an
officer,
an
administerial
officer
who
must
at
least
have
enough
colors
of
state
law
that
fit
in
under
the
original
statute
at
the
outset.
mr.
richard
g.
bell
no,
i
would
suggest
that
he
is
a
ministerial
officer
in
serving
the
writs
of
the
papers
involved
in
a
garnishment
process.
the
lawyer
is
the
one
who
initiates
the
action
who
in
connecticut
is
termed
the
commissioner
of
the
superior
court
or
an
officer
of
the
court.
he
must
work
through
a
statutorily
designated
officer
to
serve
process
who
in
so
doing
is
a
ministerial
officer
of
the
court,
i
would
submit,
for
the
purposes
of
section
2283
and
its
concept
of
proceeding.
now,
i
think
the
expressed
language
of
that
hill
case
is
significant
because
it
emphasizes,
it
is
not
just
the
question
of
liability
or
not
in
the
lawsuit
itself,
it
embraces
those
activities
triggered
by
the
lawsuit
which
bear
upon
making
a
judgment
secure
or
effective,
ancillary
proceedings
instituted
by
ministerial
officers.
and
i
believe
that
concept
of
proceedings,
when
we
have
a
pending
state
action,
is
the
one
that
you
would
apply
under
section
2283.
now,
one
of
the
things
that
was
raised
by
--
mr.
richard
g.
bell
i
believe
what
it
was
saying
your
honor
is
that
the
question
for
instance
of
liability
or
not
the
basic
rationale
of
any
judgment
that
might
be
rendered
by
the
court
is
separate
from
the
garnishment
proceeding.
i
believe
that
is
the
context
mr.
justice
brennan
in
which
the
three-judge
court
below
strategically
--
mr.
richard
g.
bell
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
g.
bell
i
take
its
language
is
not
as
direct
as
i
would
have
like
to
have
seen
it
but
the
holding
under
2283
must
necessarily
involve
the
conclusion
that
it
constitutes
proceedings.
there
was
reference
made
by
the
--
mr.
richard
g.
bell
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
g.
bell
that
is
correct,
well
there
is
not
any
question
that
the
basic
garnishment
than
--
that
is
reflected
both
lynch
and
toro
were
in
connection
with
a
proceeding
to
pending
state
court
action
that
is
both
cases
where
pending
at
that
time
in
a
sixth
circuit
court
in
connecticut
as
to
which
these
garnishments
had
in
fact
ineffective.
and
i
think
what
the
--
mr.
richard
g.
bell
well,
i
think
within
--
in
relation
to
the
federal
court?
mr.
richard
g.
bell
well,
the
creditor’s
complaints
were
filed
in
lynch
on
july
1,
1970,
toro
in
february.
and
the
complaints
in
the
federal
court,
well,
i
believe
in
march-april,
1971
mr.
richard
g.
bell
yes,
those
actions
were
--
mr.
richard
g.
bell
well,
that
is
not
prosecutions;
that
was
an
injunction
against
the
utilization
of
this
connecticut
garnishments
statute.
mr.
richard
g.
bell
i
have
to
answer
that
you
are
correct
mr.
justice
brennan
as
far
as
the
suit
is
concerned
but
i
have
--
but
they
did
seek
--
they
did
seek
the
application
--
mr.
richard
g.
bell
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
g.
bell
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
g.
bell
that
is
precisely
correct.
now
that
--
mr.
richard
g.
bell
i
believe
that
hill
v.
martin
suggests
that
given
the
policy
of
2283
that
it
needs
to
be
a
generous
instruction,
that
the
concern
expressed
in
the
statute
is
for
the
operation
of
a
state
jurisdiction.
mr.
richard
g.
bell
well,
i
think
it
requires
a
broad
interpretation
because
of
the
--
mr.
richard
g.
bell
i
believe
so
because
i
think
the
concern
--
mr.
richard
g.
bell
i
believe
the
concern
is
to
permit
if
it
is
appropriate
to
permit
the
state
proceedings
to
go
on.
now,
one
of
the
points
made
by
the
appellants
is
that
it
is
not
incumbent
to
do
so
here
because
there
is
not
any
way
to
raise
the
question
than
they
want
to
raise
in
the
state
court.
i
think
that
appears
in
the
situation.
what
they
have
said
is
that
even
if
2283
applies
at
the
outset,
we
have
a
situation
in
connecticut
where
you
cannot
raise
the
constitutional
claims
that
they
sought
to
raise
in
federal
court.
where
there
is
no
relief
in
the
state
process
then
out
of
2293
notwithstanding
of
the
federal
court
should
have
taken
jurisdiction
and
should
have
proceeded.
we
would
dispute
the
availability
of
claims
in
the
--
of
remedies
available
in
the
state
court.
mr.
richard
g.
bell
i
believe
it
is
a
--
mr.
richard
g.
bell
i
believe
it
is
with
the
total
23
issues
your
honor.
but
to
dwell
just
a
moment
on
state
remedies,
if
i
may,
because
i
believe
that
is
an
important
point.
if
there
were
no
remedies
nor
procedures
nor
processes
in
connecticut
for
raising
the
kinds
of
issues
then
we
might
have
a
different
kind
of
situation.
i
would
like
to
observe
that
you
could
raise
exactly
the
kind
of
issues
in
the
pending
state
proceedings
that
were
in
fact
raised
in
the
district
court.
i
am
not
dealing
now
with
the
preliminary
relief
--
mr.
richard
g.
bell
i
believe
if
you
sought
an
injunction
in
a
state
court
proceeding
that
is
available
by
way
of
a
counterclaim
in
court
--
mr.
richard
g.
bell
that
is
right.
mr.
richard
g.
bell
i
am.
i
am
suggesting
that
the
defendant
can
raise
either
by
independent
action
or
by
counterclaim
in
the
state
suit,
an
injunction
based
on
the
debt
claim
deprivation
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
that
it
could
also
has
a
declaratory
judgment
process
which
is
available
to
a
defendant.
mr.
richard
g.
bell
it
could
either
be
by
independent
suit
mr.
justice
brennan
or
by
way
of
counterclaim.
now
the
declaratory
judgment
is
a
little
different
in
this
particular
court.
the
circuit
court
in
which
these
actions
lay,
the
sixth
circuit
court,
does
not
have
declaratory
judgment
jurisdiction.
you
could
raise
it
in
a
counterclaim
as
we
have
noted
on
our
brief
and
then
transfer
it
to
another
court
of
appropriate
jurisdiction.
mr.
richard
g.
bell
the
whole
action
would
follow.
but
the
point
is
that
under
connecticut
practice
both
the
injunctive
relief
is
available
and
that
is
within
the
jurisdiction
of
this
precise
court
and
the
declaratory
relief
is
also
available,
and
i
believe
that
the
law
of
the
state
of
connecticut
assures
it.
reference
has
been
made
to
michael’s
jewelers
against
handy
which
was
a
sixth
circuit
court
case
of
involving
the
same
kinds
of
set
of
facts.
that
is
the
garnishment
response
by
a
defendant.
a
motion
for
injunction
was
presented
to
the
court
there
and
that
court
addressed
itself
substantively
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
garnishment
process
in
the
light
of
snaidach.
it
held
on
the
merits
that
it
was
constitutional.
i
supposed
that
settles
for
the
time
being
the
law
of
the
sixth
judicial
circuit.
but
the
point
is,
it
indicates
illustrators
that
cannot
come
up
by
motion.
a
better
way
i
submit
would
have
been
through
if
done
so
by
counterclaim
or
by
the
declaratory
judgment
proceeding
and
even
more
effective
device
i
also
suggest
come
from
1983,
the
federal
statute
itself,
which
provides
for
a
civil
cause
of
action
for
damages
in
the
event
of
deprivation.
that
lies
by
way
of
counterclaim
in
the
same
sixth
circuit
court
which
has
the
unique
advantage
of
avoiding
any
mootness
problem
that
we
had
in
toro,
for
instance
you
would
call
the
companion
lynch
here
involve
with
situation,
where
the
garnishment
was
in
fact
released
as
civil
cause
of
action
by
way
of
counterclaim
under
1983
for
which
the
state
courts
have
concurrent
jurisdiction
to
handle
avoids
very
nicely
the
problem
of
mootness
and
combined
with
injunctive
request
and
combine
with
declaratory
judgment
permits
the
raising
in
exactly
the
same
court
below,
the
sixth
circuit
court
in
the
hague
in
connecticut
are
precisely
the
issues
that
were
sought
to
be
presented
to
the
federal
court
and
the
claims
that
have
brought
to
the
three-judge
courts.
so
i
would
say
that
that
the
availability
of
state
remedies
in
the
state
courts
makes
at
all
the
law
incumbent
for
under
the
2283
fellow
ups
and
to
have
consideration
for
the
breadth
of
the
proceedings
which
are
then
pending
and
to
permit
them
to
continue.
the
constitutional
issue
has
never
been
presented
to
the
connecticut
supreme
court
throughout
the
long
history
of
the
garnishment
process.
the
constitutional
issue
both
as
to
the
us
constitution
and
even
under
the
state
of
connecticut
constitutions
which
is
a
brand
new
constitutional
since
1965,
it
adopted
a
new
one.
those
are
open
issues
as
far
as
the
state
is
concerned
and
that
state
supreme
court
has
never
in
light
of
snaidach
examined
this
process.
i
believe
all
the
more
reason
to
construe
the
concepts
of
proceedings
as
it
is
construed
in
hill
against
martin
forbear
of
the
federal
intervention
and
permit
the
state
court
process
to
continue.
the
question
of
expressed
exception
to
2283
is
discussed
at
length
in
our
brief
and
all
i
would
say
in
conclusion
is
that
it
is
not
just
an
exception
it
is
an
expressed
exception
which
is
required
to
2283,
at
least
some
reference
in
the
statute
which
takes
cognizance
of
the
problem
of
two
pending
actions
going
on
simultaneously
and
tells
one
or
the
other
to
stay
or
to
proceed.
there
is
no
expressed
reference
in
1983
to
that
problem.
there
is
no
mention
of
the
difficulty
exposed
by
two
pending
actions
and
no
requirement
of
one
if
the
other
go
forward
as
is
the
case
with
virtually
everyone
of
those
expressed
exceptions
which
have
been
historically
noted
to
the
2283
statute.
i
have
not
had
occasion
to
discuss
further
the
request
for
declaratory
relief
which
was
embodied
here
or
the
denial
of
the
injunctive
remedy
below,
we
believe
it
takes
care
of
that
request
as
well
which
was
made
our
position
on
that
as
stated
in
the
brief
is
that
the
request
for
declaratory
judgment
is
essentially
of
the
same
effect
as
the
request
for
declaratory
--
for
injunctive
relief
and
we
believe
that
the
prior
decision
in
cases
so
hold.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
richard
g.
bell
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
pick
up
if
i
may
at
precisely
the
point
where
my
brother
mr.
lesser
left
off
and
that
is
posing
the
question
as
to
whether
congress
intended
these
claims
to
have
been
heard
by
the
three-judge
district
court
below.
the
basic
holding
of
the
lower
court
was
that
it
did
not
have
subject
matter
jurisdiction
under
the
section
1343
and
that
was
the
basis
of
its
dismissal.
now,
the
appellees’
position
on
the
1343
jurisdictional
question
rests
squarely
upon
the
doctrine
annunciated
in
the
eisen
case
which
in
turn
goes
back
to
the
postulation
by
mr.
justice
stone
in
the
hague
decision
as
to
the
relation
between
1343
and
1331.
i
would
like
to
review
that
because
that
is
the
basis
of
our
position
and
the
basis
of
the
lower
court’s
dismissal
below.
now
the
appellants
have
a
direct
argument
and
an
appealing
argument
as
to
why
this
is
not
so
and
they
say
basically
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
enacted
with
the
purpose
in
mind
to
protect
precisely
the
kind
of
right
that
is
involved
in
this
case.
further,
that
section
1343
and
section
1983,
the
statute
created
the
cause
of
action
were
designed
to
pick
up
those
constitutional
rights
and
to
provide
a
cause
of
action
and
jurisdiction
to
secure
them.
finally,
the
appellants
say
that
section
1331,
a
$10,000
jurisdictional
statute,
is
to
be
looked
apart
--
looked
upon
as
separate
and
apart
from
and
distinct
from
the
1343
and
1983
propositions.
now,
if
the
matter
were
as
clear
as
this
from
the
legislative
history,
the
wonder
is
really
that
mr.
justice
stone
had
to
go
through
its
process
of
reasoning
in
the
hague
decision
at
all.
and
the
answer
must
be
simply
that
a
selective
choice
of
the
legislative
history
is
simply
not
as
clear
and
not
as
precise
and
not
as
symmetrical
as
the
appellants
would
have
it.
i
believe
that
the
reason
for
this
really
is
that
what
you
overlook
in
establishing
that
kind
of
precise
intent
to
a
portion
of
the
civil
rights
legislation
is
the
nature
of
the
process
that
went
on
in
congress
for
the
period
following
the
civil
war.
in
mr.
justice
frankfurter’s
words,
“this
were
years
of
struggle
and
of
compromise.”
and
to
reduce
a
portion
of
the
legislative
result
to
clarity
and
direct
us
in
simplicity
overlooks
the
nature
of
that
struggle
and
it
overlooks
the
triumphs
and
the
defeats
of
that
compromising
process
and
it
overlooks
the
intensity
of
the
passions
that
were
involved,
thus
the
post
civil
war
congress
has
tried
to
hammer
out
in
lasting
terms
what
it
was
that
it
had
torn
a
country
apart
for
five
years
during
the
civil
war.
now,
i
think
it
is
instructive
to
review
the
period
that
is
in
question
while
this
legislative
history
accumulates.
we
begin
in
1865
with
the
thirteenth
amendment
itself
which
the
court’s
emancipation.
in
1866,
we
have
the
first
of
the
civil
rights
act.
that
was
the
act
which,
among
other
things,
included
what
is
today
section
1983,
that
statute
dealing
with
equal
rights
as
to
ownership
and
as
to
disposition
of
property.
and
there
is
evidence
from
the
history
as
suggested
in
our
brief
that
1983
was
the
keystone
of
the
reconstruction
of
congress’
efforts
to
preserve
that
kind
of
property
right.
in
1868
the
fourteenth
amendment
himself,
in
1870
there
is
another
civil
rights
act
and
the
fifteenth
amendment
dealing
with
voting
rights
comes
in
to
being.
in
1871,
there
are
two
civil
rights
act
that
came
on
the
books
and
one
of
them
is
so
called
ku
klux
klan
act
of
1871
from
whence
the
present
day
1983
statute
creating
a
cause
of
action
and
the
1343
jurisdictional
statute
draw.
now,
there
is
evidence
in
the
history
that
what
was
a
paramount
concern
of
this
ku
klux
klan
act
of
1871
was
the
unequal
treatment
of
people,
evidenced
by
the
clan
activity
in
the
south
from
whence
the
act
took
its
name.
the
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race,
the
denial
of
equal
opportunities
and
the
denial
of
the
equal
applications
of
the
laws
in
the
years
following
the
civil
war.
finally,
the
last
stage
in
this
legislative
history
in
1875
is
the
first
emergence
of
section
1331,
the
jurisdictional
statute
which
now
deals
in
terms
of
$10,000,
but
at
the
time
of
the
original
passage
i
believe
it
was
a
$500
statute.
there
is
pause
in
1875
and
there
is
a
recodification
that
takes
place
in
that
year
and
some
adjustments
were
made
to
the
statute
that
had
preceded
it.
for
instance,
i
believe
it
is
at
that
time
that
the
statement
in
1983
dealing
with
a
cause
of
action
based
on
federal
laws
as
well
as
the
constitution
first
comes
in
to
being
in
1875.
the
jurisdictional
statute
1343
includes
at
that
time
a
statement
with
respect
to
causes
of
action
based
on
federal
laws
denying
equal
rights
and
expressed
records
to
the
kind
of
equality
concerned
that
it
was
at
the
heart
of
the
civil
rights
legislation.
now
what
mr.
justice
stone’s
formulation
in
hague
case
does
is
set
the
year
1875
as
the
point
of
departure
from
whence
both
1343
and
1331
have
existed
on
the
books
side
by
side
down
to
the
time
of
the
hague
decision,
which
was
in
1939.
excuse
me,
there
was
one
legislative
activity
during
that
period
but
not
of
tremendous
significance,
that
was
in
1911
recodification
when
the
jurisdiction
of
the
circuit
courts
and
the
district
court
became
merged
in
the
district
court
and
1343,
the
jurisdictional
statute,
preserved
the
phrase
that
it
has
today
dealing
with
jurisdiction
to
causes
under
those
federal
laws
providing
for
equal
rights.
now,
what
mr.
justice
stone
saw
from
the
history
that
he
looked
up
in
its
entirety
and
as
a
whole
were
these
two
parallel
statutes:
one
providing
a
cause
of
action
under
section
1343
with
no
monetary
allocations
or
no
monetary
requirement
whatsoever,
and
the
parallel
statute
1331
which
did
in
fact
have
a
monetary
requirement
which
is,
as
i
have
said
before,
has
been
changed
throughout
during
the
course
of
the
year.
now
his
analysis
led
him
to
believe
that
1343,
that
jurisdictional
statute
which
is
at
issue
in
this
case,
was
the
one
intended
to
be
directed
at
those
causes
of
actions
which
were
essentially
denials
of
personal
rights,
and
those
causes
of
action
based
essentially
on
denial
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
law,
the
discriminatory
evils
which
the
reconstruction
congress
had
noted
in
the
ku
klux
klan
act
and
others.
1331
on
the
other
hand,
according
to
mr.
justice
stone’s
formulation,
was
that
statute
designed
to
pick
up
those
actions
which
were
essentially
of
a
property
nature
capable
of
being
measured
in
monetary
amounts.
now,
in
looking
back
at
this
history
his
feel
the
vision
was
not
entirely
uncluttered
or
unclear
because
he
had
the
precedents
performed
in
such
cases
as
the
pleasants
case,
greenhow
and
holt
against
indiana
which
were
cases
giving
some
attention
to
the
1343
question
and
those
cases
had
started
the
court
found
attack
consistent
with
mr.
justice
stone’s
formulation
to
the
effect
that
1343
was
a
statute
dealing
with
civil
rights,
1331,
the
statute
dealing
with
property
allegations
which
were
truly
property,
and
did
not
involve
those
rights
susceptible
of
being
measured
in
monetary
or
pecuniary
terms.
that
is
the
rationale
of
mr.
justice,
hague
lies
and
that
is
the
one
if
it
comes
to
rest
in
the
second
circuit
case
involving
eisen
which
was
judge
friendly’s
opinion
some
30
years
later,
i
believe
in
1969.
now,
in
the
eisen
decision,
judge
friendly
is
candid
and
frank
to
know
the
difficulty
with
the
hague
formulation,
because
it
was
30
years
previous
and
also
because
there
was
no
majority
opinion
in
the
case
and
that
judge
friendly
pointed
that
out
in
the
course
of
his
opinion.
however,
notwithstanding
what
he
termed
to
be
difficulties
with
it,
notwithstanding
some
self
confessed
uncertainty
as
he
explained
quite
expressedly
in
his
opinion.
he
found
that
the
formulation
had
three
specific
virtues.
he
sought
as
accounting
for
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court
that
is
prior
to
the
term
of
the
eisen
case
or
those
as
to
where
jurisdiction
had
been
granted
and
those
as
to
where
it
had
not
with
one
exception.
he
sought
as
harmonizing
the
parallel
relation
of
1343
and
1331
during
their
long
history
stemming
from
the
recodification
in
1875.
and
finally,
he
felt
convinced
in
the
eisen
opinion
that
this
rationale
of
mr.
justice
stone
preserved
in
1343
the
kind
of
case
that
was
at
the
heart
of
the
civil
rights
enactment,
i
believe
we
call
them
the
civil
war.
that
is
it
preserved.
those
causes
of
action
based
on
discrimination,
based
on
unequal
treatment,
based
on
denial
of
equal
opportunity
which
could
not
be
merged
with
money
which
not
lend
themselves
to
any
kind
of
property
analysis.
and
thus
the
eisen
decision
in
the
second
circuit
effectively
repeats
the
stone
analysis
and
gives
rise
to
these
--
the
separation
between
1343
and
1331
on
the
basis
of
whether
or
not
the
right
alleges
or
assorted
is
or
is
not
capable
of
monetary
evaluation
or
whether
it
is
one
of
those
intangible
rights
of
personal
liberty
which
is
not
so
capable
and
therefore
for
which
no
monetary
requirement
lies
within
the
statute.
now,
it
was
the
application
of
this
analysis.
that
is
of
the
eisen
rationale
based
on
mr.
justice
stone’s
rationale
that
was
at
the
heart
of
the
lower
court’s
dismissal
on
the
basis
of
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
now,
the
garnishment
process
in
connecticut
--
and
may
i
just
explain
that
the
garnishment
process
is
a
kind
of
attachment
and
mr.
justice
stewart
raised
this
question,
i
believe,
the
statute
itself
is
entitled
one
of
four
in
attachment,
and
garnishment
is
used
not
with
respect
to
that
statute
but
the
understanding
that
is
part
of
the
overall
attachment
pattern
in
the
state
of
connecticut.
but
--
mr.
richard
g.
bell
that
is
correct
your
honor.
if
we
look
at
the
attachment
statutes
as
a
whole
there
are
several
things
which
is
a
matter
of
fact
are
proscribed,
all
of
them
having
kind
of
a
common
thread
of
interest
which
reflects
a
legislative
concern
in
connecticut
for
those
kinds
of
property
which
come
closes
to
enabling
one
to
exist
and
enabling
one
to
operate
in
a
free
society.
you
cannot
attach
or
reach
your
garnish
wages
in
advance
with
an
action.
you
cannot
deal
with
household
or
personal
effects.
you
cannot
reach
the
tools
of
one’s
tree.
you
cannot
reach
an
automobile
without
a
court
order.
there
are
certain
kinds
of
action
wherein
attachment
of
any
nature
or
garnishment
or
otherwise
is
prohibited
before
suit.
there
were
classes
of
plaintiffs
as
to
whom
the
process
is
denied
in
advance
of
suit.
mr.
richard
g.
bell
no
--
mr.
richard
g.
bell
no,
if
the
garnishment
is
properly
effective
at
the
outset
of
suit
it
will
remain
pending
throughout
the
duration
of
the
suit.
so
its
time
limit
is
so
extensive
with
the
tendency
of
the
laws
of
itself.
mr.
richard
g.
bell
that
is
correct.
the
garnishment
would
continue
to
apply
during
the
pendency
of
that
action
and
until
the
--
within
a
certain
period
following
judgment
as
a
matter
of
fact
allowing
for
execution
on
that
garnish.
the
--
what
i
am
trying
to
make
though
is
that
the
process
from
the
beginning,
it
is
circumscribe,
with
respect
to
certain
classes
of
assets
and
certain
classes
of
suits
and
certain
classes
of
plaintiffs
for
whom
or
as
to
whom
the
process
is
simply
not
available.
now,
these
two
plaintiffs
in
the
basic
cases
below
had
money
claims
against
the
defendants.
one
sued
on
a
note
the
other
provided
a
writ.
they
were
prohibited
by
connecticut
statute
from
attaching
the
kinds
of
asset
or
seeking
to
garnish
the
kinds
of
assets
that
i
have
described.
that
is
wages
at
the
source,
automobiles
without
a
court
order,
necessarily
household,
personal
effects
or
tools
of
one’s
pre
tree.
they
were
permitted
to
garnish
to
reach
the
assets
not
in
the
hands
of
the
debtor
but
in
the
hands
of
a
third
party.
in
this
case
there
was
one
hand
of
savings
account
and
the
other
hand
a
checking
account,
essentially
a
debt
due
which
is
the
keyword
in
our
garnishment
statute
from
those
banking
institutions
to
the
defendants
in
question.
now
the
effect
of
doing
so
is
to
put
a
place,
a
conditional
lien,
on
that
asset
during
dependency
of
that
lawsuit.
once
that
is
done,
that
is
once
the
garnishment
process
is
effected
there
are
provisions
under
the
statute
whereby
the
defendants
can
come
in
directly
to
the
court
for
reduction,
for
a
bill
of
particulars
for
verification
of
the
claim,
for
a
substitution
of
bond.
and
that
does
not
rely
on
the
pendency
of
the
suit;
that
can
be
done
as
soon
as
the
garnishment
process
has
been
reached.
but
it
was
under
these
circumstances,
i.e.,
in
looking
at
debt
due
to
defendants
from
a
third
party
that
the
court
below
attempted
to
analyze
the
nature
of
the
interest
involved
and
found
it
to
be
essentially
a
property
interest,
i.e.,
is
one
measurable
by
money
since
the
accounts
in
question
were
fixed
amounts.
being
a
property,
interest
it
found
it
not
to
lie
within
the
1343
formulation
under
the
eisen
and
the
hague
rationales
and
being
merely
a
property
interest.
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
based
--
finding
itself
without
jurisdiction
was
based
on
implicit
assumption
that
would
be
subject
to
the
1331
jurisdictional
statute.
now,
there
was
no
alternative
holding
in
the
court
below
and
that
was
the
one
predicated
on
2283.
2283
being
the
anti-injunction
statute
which
proscribes
the
application
of
injunction
during
the
pendency
of
state
court
proceeding,
and
this
was
relied
upon
by
the
lower
court
as
an
alternative
holding
having
addressed
itself
to
the
jurisdictional
issue
first.
now,
the
purpose
and
the
policy
of
2283,
i
believe,
are
familiar.
the
statute
dates
from
1793
and
it
reflects
the
kind
of
sensitive
concern
for
state
proceedings
that
ought
to
be
had
by
the
federal
judicial
system
once
the
state
proceeding
or
once
the
state
system
has
been
set
in
motion.
it
was
a
matter
of
first
business
for
the
congress
of
united
states
to
establish
that
relation
between
the
two
judicial
processing.
now
the
connecticut
garnishment
statute
or
the
attachment
statute
with
which
we
are
dealing
with,
dates
of
almost
equal
vintage
as
a
matter
of
fact;
it
goes
back
to
the
beginning
of
the
state
of
connecticut
and
represents
a
scheme
that
has
been
in
effect
in
the
state
of
connecticut
during
its
judicial
history.
you
must
have
this
old
state
policy
and
a
venerable
federal
policy
now
in
focus
within
the
confines
of
section
2283,
the
anti-injunction
statute.
now,
the
question
becomes
whether
for
the
purposes
of
section
2283,
the
garnishment
arrangement
in
connecticut,
the
garnishment
machinery,
constitutes
proceedings
within
the
meaning
of
section
2283
as
to
which
the
federal
action
should
be
staid
during
the
pendency
of
the
state
case
and
the
state
proceedings.
mr.
richard
g.
bell
excuse
me.
mr.
richard
g.
bell
well,
it
involves
court
procedures
your
honor.
it
is
affected
that
is
to
--
mr.
richard
g.
bell
well,
and
that
it
invokes
the
utilization
of
statutory
procedures
in
court
or
attacking
the
garnishment,
if
that
is
desired
by
the
defendants.
mr.
richard
g.
bell
they
did
nothing,
i
believe.
mr.
richard
g.
bell
well,
that
bears
on
the
question
of
what
is
a
proceeding
under
2283.
it
is
true
that
the
garnishment
--
mr.
richard
g.
bell
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
our
position
that
that
is
a
proceeding
and
that
it
is
a
proceeding
--
mr.
richard
g.
bell
well,
the
concept
of
proceedings
in
2283
your
honor,
i
believe
takes
in
all
phases
of
a
lawsuit
and
it
takes
them
in
from
beginning
to
end.
there
is
a
hill
against
martin
decision
which
is
cited
--
mr.
richard
g.
bell
well,
he
needs
to
proceed
with
an
order
of
court
your
honor
at
the
upset
and
that
--
mr.
richard
g.
bell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
g.
bell
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
richard
g.
bell
for
automobiles
that
could
--
it
is
a
statute
as
proscribed.
mr.
richard
g.
bell
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
g.
bell
that
is
correct
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
g.
bell
well,
this
case
was
--
this
case
was
pending
at
the
time
the
federal
action
was
instituted.
that
is
the
basic
interest
--
mr.
richard
g.
bell
well,
they
are
not
seeking
to
enjoin
the
application
of
the
utilization
of
the
connecticut
statutes.
mr.
richard
g.
bell
that
is
correct.
they
are
seeking
to
join
the
application
--
mr.
richard
g.
bell
well,
i
think
that
is
the
question,
and
then
one
of
the
allegations
is
that
they
make
it
that
the
connecticut
courts
do
not
have
the
machinery
to
do
just
that.
mr.
richard
g.
bell
maybe
i
could
explain
it
this
way.
if
the
question
zeroes
in
on
exactly
what
proceedings
are
within
the
concept
of
2283,
i
would
suggest
this:
if
the
--
given
the
policy
of
2283
which
is
that
concern
for
the
relation
of
this
judicial
systems,
given
the
fact
that
the
question
as
a
matter
of
fact
as
to
constitutionality
is
an
open
question
in
the
connecticut
courts
and
given
the
language
of
prior
court
decision
here
in
hill
against
martin
i
would
suggest
that
is
proceedings.
the
hill
language
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter
suggested
that
the
concept
of
proceedings
for
2283
purposes
should
include
all
steps
and
all
phases
of
a
lawsuit
or
actions
by
ministerial
officers
of
the
court
including
else
which
are
directive
either
ancillary
or
supplementary
for
its
making
of
the
suit
or
the
judgment
effective.
and
i
would
say
that
that
concept
to
proceedings
dealing
with
the
whole
workings
of
the
judicial
processes
of
a
state
does
include
the
process
of
garnishment
and
does
include
the
process
of
attachment.
mr.
richard
g.
bell
i
believe
that
deputy
sheriff
in
service
was
appointed,
he
is
appointed,
i
believe,
by
a
sheriff
who
is
an
elected
official
if
i
am
not
mistaken,
i
believe
that
is
the
case.
mr.
richard
g.
bell
well,
he
is
a
--
he
is
an
officer,
an
administerial
officer
who
must
at
least
have
enough
colors
of
state
law
that
fit
in
under
the
original
statute
at
the
outset.
mr.
richard
g.
bell
no,
i
would
suggest
that
he
is
a
ministerial
officer
in
serving
the
writs
of
the
papers
involved
in
a
garnishment
process.
the
lawyer
is
the
one
who
initiates
the
action
who
in
connecticut
is
termed
the
commissioner
of
the
superior
court
or
an
officer
of
the
court.
he
must
work
through
a
statutorily
designated
officer
to
serve
process
who
in
so
doing
is
a
ministerial
officer
of
the
court,
i
would
submit,
for
the
purposes
of
section
2283
and
its
concept
of
proceeding.
now,
i
think
the
expressed
language
of
that
hill
case
is
significant
because
it
emphasizes,
it
is
not
just
the
question
of
liability
or
not
in
the
lawsuit
itself,
it
embraces
those
activities
triggered
by
the
lawsuit
which
bear
upon
making
a
judgment
secure
or
effective,
ancillary
proceedings
instituted
by
ministerial
officers.
and
i
believe
that
concept
of
proceedings,
when
we
have
a
pending
state
action,
is
the
one
that
you
would
apply
under
section
2283.
now,
one
of
the
things
that
was
raised
by
--
mr.
richard
g.
bell
i
believe
what
it
was
saying
your
honor
is
that
the
question
for
instance
of
liability
or
not
the
basic
rationale
of
any
judgment
that
might
be
rendered
by
the
court
is
separate
from
the
garnishment
proceeding.
i
believe
that
is
the
context
mr.
justice
brennan
in
which
the
three-judge
court
below
strategically
--
mr.
richard
g.
bell
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
g.
bell
i
take
its
language
is
not
as
direct
as
i
would
have
like
to
have
seen
it
but
the
holding
under
2283
must
necessarily
involve
the
conclusion
that
it
constitutes
proceedings.
there
was
reference
made
by
the
--
mr.
richard
g.
bell
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
g.
bell
that
is
correct,
well
there
is
not
any
question
that
the
basic
garnishment
than
--
that
is
reflected
both
lynch
and
toro
were
in
connection
with
a
proceeding
to
pending
state
court
action
that
is
both
cases
where
pending
at
that
time
in
a
sixth
circuit
court
in
connecticut
as
to
which
these
garnishments
had
in
fact
ineffective.
and
i
think
what
the
--
mr.
richard
g.
bell
well,
i
think
within
--
in
relation
to
the
federal
court?
mr.
richard
g.
bell
well,
the
creditor’s
complaints
were
filed
in
lynch
on
july
1,
1970,
toro
in
february.
and
the
complaints
in
the
federal
court,
well,
i
believe
in
march-april,
1971
mr.
richard
g.
bell
yes,
those
actions
were
--
mr.
richard
g.
bell
well,
that
is
not
prosecutions;
that
was
an
injunction
against
the
utilization
of
this
connecticut
garnishments
statute.
mr.
richard
g.
bell
i
have
to
answer
that
you
are
correct
mr.
justice
brennan
as
far
as
the
suit
is
concerned
but
i
have
--
but
they
did
seek
--
they
did
seek
the
application
--
mr.
richard
g.
bell
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
g.
bell
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
g.
bell
that
is
precisely
correct.
now
that
--
mr.
richard
g.
bell
i
believe
that
hill
v.
martin
suggests
that
given
the
policy
of
2283
that
it
needs
to
be
a
generous
instruction,
that
the
concern
expressed
in
the
statute
is
for
the
operation
of
a
state
jurisdiction.
mr.
richard
g.
bell
well,
i
think
it
requires
a
broad
interpretation
because
of
the
--
mr.
richard
g.
bell
i
believe
so
because
i
think
the
concern
--
mr.
richard
g.
bell
i
believe
the
concern
is
to
permit
if
it
is
appropriate
to
permit
the
state
proceedings
to
go
on.
now,
one
of
the
points
made
by
the
appellants
is
that
it
is
not
incumbent
to
do
so
here
because
there
is
not
any
way
to
raise
the
question
than
they
want
to
raise
in
the
state
court.
i
think
that
appears
in
the
situation.
what
they
have
said
is
that
even
if
2283
applies
at
the
outset,
we
have
a
situation
in
connecticut
where
you
cannot
raise
the
constitutional
claims
that
they
sought
to
raise
in
federal
court.
where
there
is
no
relief
in
the
state
process
then
out
of
2293
notwithstanding
of
the
federal
court
should
have
taken
jurisdiction
and
should
have
proceeded.
we
would
dispute
the
availability
of
claims
in
the
--
of
remedies
available
in
the
state
court.
mr.
richard
g.
bell
i
believe
it
is
a
--
mr.
richard
g.
bell
i
believe
it
is
with
the
total
23
issues
your
honor.
but
to
dwell
just
a
moment
on
state
remedies,
if
i
may,
because
i
believe
that
is
an
important
point.
if
there
were
no
remedies
nor
procedures
nor
processes
in
connecticut
for
raising
the
kinds
of
issues
then
we
might
have
a
different
kind
of
situation.
i
would
like
to
observe
that
you
could
raise
exactly
the
kind
of
issues
in
the
pending
state
proceedings
that
were
in
fact
raised
in
the
district
court.
i
am
not
dealing
now
with
the
preliminary
relief
--
mr.
richard
g.
bell
i
believe
if
you
sought
an
injunction
in
a
state
court
proceeding
that
is
available
by
way
of
a
counterclaim
in
court
--
mr.
richard
g.
bell
that
is
right.
mr.
richard
g.
bell
i
am.
i
am
suggesting
that
the
defendant
can
raise
either
by
independent
action
or
by
counterclaim
in
the
state
suit,
an
injunction
based
on
the
debt
claim
deprivation
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
that
it
could
also
has
a
declaratory
judgment
process
which
is
available
to
a
defendant.
mr.
richard
g.
bell
it
could
either
be
by
independent
suit
mr.
justice
brennan
or
by
way
of
counterclaim.
now
the
declaratory
judgment
is
a
little
different
in
this
particular
court.
the
circuit
court
in
which
these
actions
lay,
the
sixth
circuit
court,
does
not
have
declaratory
judgment
jurisdiction.
you
could
raise
it
in
a
counterclaim
as
we
have
noted
on
our
brief
and
then
transfer
it
to
another
court
of
appropriate
jurisdiction.
mr.
richard
g.
bell
the
whole
action
would
follow.
but
the
point
is
that
under
connecticut
practice
both
the
injunctive
relief
is
available
and
that
is
within
the
jurisdiction
of
this
precise
court
and
the
declaratory
relief
is
also
available,
and
i
believe
that
the
law
of
the
state
of
connecticut
assures
it.
reference
has
been
made
to
michael’s
jewelers
against
handy
which
was
a
sixth
circuit
court
case
of
involving
the
same
kinds
of
set
of
facts.
that
is
the
garnishment
response
by
a
defendant.
a
motion
for
injunction
was
presented
to
the
court
there
and
that
court
addressed
itself
substantively
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
garnishment
process
in
the
light
of
snaidach.
it
held
on
the
merits
that
it
was
constitutional.
i
supposed
that
settles
for
the
time
being
the
law
of
the
sixth
judicial
circuit.
but
the
point
is,
it
indicates
illustrators
that
cannot
come
up
by
motion.
a
better
way
i
submit
would
have
been
through
if
done
so
by
counterclaim
or
by
the
declaratory
judgment
proceeding
and
even
more
effective
device
i
also
suggest
come
from
1983,
the
federal
statute
itself,
which
provides
for
a
civil
cause
of
action
for
damages
in
the
event
of
deprivation.
that
lies
by
way
of
counterclaim
in
the
same
sixth
circuit
court
which
has
the
unique
advantage
of
avoiding
any
mootness
problem
that
we
had
in
toro,
for
instance
you
would
call
the
companion
lynch
here
involve
with
situation,
where
the
garnishment
was
in
fact
released
as
civil
cause
of
action
by
way
of
counterclaim
under
1983
for
which
the
state
courts
have
concurrent
jurisdiction
to
handle
avoids
very
nicely
the
problem
of
mootness
and
combined
with
injunctive
request
and
combine
with
declaratory
judgment
permits
the
raising
in
exactly
the
same
court
below,
the
sixth
circuit
court
in
the
hague
in
connecticut
are
precisely
the
issues
that
were
sought
to
be
presented
to
the
federal
court
and
the
claims
that
have
brought
to
the
three-judge
courts.
so
i
would
say
that
that
the
availability
of
state
remedies
in
the
state
courts
makes
at
all
the
law
incumbent
for
under
the
2283
fellow
ups
and
to
have
consideration
for
the
breadth
of
the
proceedings
which
are
then
pending
and
to
permit
them
to
continue.
the
constitutional
issue
has
never
been
presented
to
the
connecticut
supreme
court
throughout
the
long
history
of
the
garnishment
process.
the
constitutional
issue
both
as
to
the
us
constitution
and
even
under
the
state
of
connecticut
constitutions
which
is
a
brand
new
constitutional
since
1965,
it
adopted
a
new
one.
those
are
open
issues
as
far
as
the
state
is
concerned
and
that
state
supreme
court
has
never
in
light
of
snaidach
examined
this
process.
i
believe
all
the
more
reason
to
construe
the
concepts
of
proceedings
as
it
is
construed
in
hill
against
martin
forbear
of
the
federal
intervention
and
permit
the
state
court
process
to
continue.
the
question
of
expressed
exception
to
2283
is
discussed
at
length
in
our
brief
and
all
i
would
say
in
conclusion
is
that
it
is
not
just
an
exception
it
is
an
expressed
exception
which
is
required
to
2283,
at
least
some
reference
in
the
statute
which
takes
cognizance
of
the
problem
of
two
pending
actions
going
on
simultaneously
and
tells
one
or
the
other
to
stay
or
to
proceed.
there
is
no
expressed
reference
in
1983
to
that
problem.
there
is
no
mention
of
the
difficulty
exposed
by
two
pending
actions
and
no
requirement
of
one
if
the
other
go
forward
as
is
the
case
with
virtually
everyone
of
those
expressed
exceptions
which
have
been
historically
noted
to
the
2283
statute.
i
have
not
had
occasion
to
discuss
further
the
request
for
declaratory
relief
which
was
embodied
here
or
the
denial
of
the
injunctive
remedy
below,
we
believe
it
takes
care
of
that
request
as
well
which
was
made
our
position
on
that
as
stated
in
the
brief
is
that
the
request
for
declaratory
judgment
is
essentially
of
the
same
effect
as
the
request
for
declaratory
--
for
injunctive
relief
and
we
believe
that
the
prior
decision
in
cases
so
hold.
thank
you
your
honor.
