lynch
against
household
finance.
mr.

you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
in
connecticut,
would
you
clear
this
up
for
me,
must
there
be
an
action
pending
against
to
the
garnish
--
the
defendant
at
the
time.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
you
do
it
on
your
own
way
then.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
must
be
an
action
pending
first
against
the
defendant.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
speaking
--
you
were
addressing
yourself
in
minnesota
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
which
is
very
common
of
many
other
states,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
suspend
for
lunch
at
this
time
counsel.
you

got
about
17
minutes
of
your
time
left
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
see
if
i
can
get
a
little
better
light
on
your
constitutional
argument
by
hypothetical
with
reference
to
the
other
states.
if
a
garnishment
were
permitted
by
notice
or
process
served
on
the
garnishee
and
on
the
defendant
after
an
action
has
been
commenced
in
the
state
court.
do
you
think
that
meets
constitutional
standard?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
i
am
trying
to
test
some
of
your
arguments
by
that
context.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
noticed,
you
mean
--
i
noticed
that
the
notice
must
allow
a
period
to
respond
before
the
garnishment
would
take
effect?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
then
of
course
they
would
not
usually
be
any
property
remaining.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
unless
the
property
were
impounded
print
pending,
the
disposition
of
the
process.

e.
burger
thank

merits,
some
states
put
time
limits?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
three
months

chief

or

have
been
impounded
all
that
time.

a
counterclaim
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
under
1983
grounds?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
does
--
do
you
say
it
does
not
relate
to
the
matter
in
