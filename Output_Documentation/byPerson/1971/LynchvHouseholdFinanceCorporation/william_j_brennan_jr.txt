justice

j.
brennan,

then
when
he
get
the
judgment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
--
you
garnished
as
here
i
gather
savings
account.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
a
checking
account.
now
then
the
garnisher
has
to
--
has
immediately
to
file
a
civil
action
of
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
much
time
does
he
have?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
do
not
get
into
the
state
court
until
day
55?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
after
the
proceeding
--
even
afterward
you
get
into
the
state
court
on
day
55?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
the
only,
you
say
they
were
in
error
in
denying
that
they
have
jurisdiction
in
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
we
agreed
with
you
on
that
not
we
do
not
reach
the
merit.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
mr.
bell,
i
am
looking
at
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
on
page
26.
what
they
have
said
is
although
garnishment
maybe
separated
from
the
underlying
(inaudible)
of
action.
what
does
the
court
mean
by
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
do
not
mind
anywhere
in
this
opinion,
i
gather
under
the
statute,
now
the
question
is
whether
this
garnishment,
whatever
it
is,
is
a
proceeding
in
a
state
court,
did
you
get
it,
that
the
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
do
not
see
that
this
opinion
addresses
itself
directly
to
that
question,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
more
than
proceedings
whether
it
constitutes
proceedings
in
a
state
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
what
the
statute
is.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally
when
were
the
complaints,
repetitive
complaints
filed
in,
in
a
relation
to
the
time
with
the
federal
court
complaints.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
in
any
event,
after
the
creditor’s
complaints
were
filed
in
the
state
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
gather
--
but
it
is
the
case,
is
it
not,
that
the
complaint
in
federal
court
did
not
ask
for
any
restraint
against
the
prosecution
of
the
creditor’s
complaints
in
state
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
that
my
question
was
mr.
bell.
it
did
not
ask
any
restraint
against
the
creditors
going
on
with
their
creditor’s
suits,
did
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
they
want
to
do
is
take
a
way
from
you
the
security
you
now
held
under
the
garnishment
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
process,
but
whether
recovery
of
a
judgment
if
you
got
it
in
there.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
not
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
are
we
to
--
how
should
we
approach
interpreting
proceedings
in
the
state
court
strictly
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
generous
against
jurisdiction.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
broad
interpretation
against
jurisdiction.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
jurisdiction
i
mean
against
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me
mr.
bell,
is
the
question
before
us
whether
1983
is
an
expressed
deception.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
noticed
it
was
decided
apparently
or
the
second
circuit
poses
it
is
not.
it
is
not
recognized
that
1983
is
an
express
of
section
2283.
is
that
issue
before
us?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
to
which,
in
the
creditor’s
action?
how
do
you
do
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
the
creditor
brings
a
suit
for
recovery
on
a
note,
is
that
what
it
was?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
in
that
proceeding
you
are
suggesting
the
defendant
is
seeking
an
injunction
against
the
garnishment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
would
be
independent,
that
would
be
independent
suit,
would
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
whole
suit
then
or
just
a
counterclaim?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
when
he
get
the
judgment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
--

garnished

i
gather
