mr.
david
m.
lesser
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
under
title
28,
section
1253,
from
the
judgment
of
the
three-judge
district
court
in
the
district
of
connecticut
which
denied
injunctive
and
declaratory
relief.
the
issue
is
whether
the
federal
courts
are
powerless
to
award
any
redress
to
low
income
wage
earners
whose
earnings
on
deposit
are
summarily
garnished
by
connecticut
deputy
sheriffs
without
any
notice,
hearing,
or
order
of
the
state
court.
mr.
david
m.
lesser
i
would
like
mr.
chief
justice
to
begin
answering
that
question
and
then
explain
the
connecticut
practice
of
summary
prejudgment
garnishment
in
some
detail
because
it
is
quite
unusual.
mr.
david
m.
lesser
in
connecticut,
an
alleged
creditor
and
his
attorney
has
absolute
discretion
prior
to
instituting
suit
against
the
debtor
to
summarily
garnish
earnings
in
his
account
without
any
involvement
of
the
court.
the
garnishment
occurs
before
process
is
served
upon
the
debtor.
the
attorney
for
the
alleged
creditor
instructs
deputy
sheriffs
to
levy
the
garnishment
by
serving
a
writ
of
garnishment
on
the
garnishee
bank.
mr.
david
m.
lesser
judgment
is
obtained
perhaps
several
years
after
civil
action
is
commenced
by
service
of
process
on
the
debtor
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
david
m.
lesser
and
a
checking
account,
mr.
justice.
mr.
david
m.
lesser
he
does
not
immediately
need
to
file.
mr.
david
m.
lesser
under
the
applicable
statutes,
section
329
of
title
52
and
section
48
(a)
of
title
52.
it
would
be
possible
for
the
garnishment
to
be
levied
for
example
on
day
one
for
the
alleged
debtor
to
be
served
with
process,
let
us
say,
on
day
45
or
50
and
for
process
to
be
docketed
in
the
state
court,
let
us
say,
on
day
55.
mr.
david
m.
lesser
one
never
gets
into
the
state
court
on
a
garnishment
mr.
justice
brennan
to
raise
any
questions
with
respect
to
that
garnishment.
now
--
mr.
david
m.
lesser
that
is
correct
mr.
justice,
and
i
would
like
to
explain
that.
connecticut
appears
to
be
the
only
state
in
which
an
alleged
creditor
and
his
attorney
are
permitted
in
their
absolute
discretion
to
levy
and
maintain
a
garnishment
until
final
disposition
of
the
creditor
suit
without
any
involvement
of
the
state
court.
most
other
states
require
the
creditor
to
get
some
sort
of
court
approval
before
garnishment
either
in
the
form
of
posting
a
bond,
filing
an
affidavit
and
so
far
as
we
know
in
all
other
states,
the
writ
of
garnishment
must
be
signed
or
issued
by
a
judge
or
clerk
of
court.
none
of
that
obtains
here.
now,
once
the
creditor’s
civil
suit
for
damages
is
docketed,
no
questions
relating
to
the
garnishment
can
be
considered
in
the
context
of
the
creditor’s
pending
suit.
if
the
debtor
claims
that
the
garnishment
was
levied
without
any
probable
validity,
that
the
creditors
claim
has
no
merit
or
that
there
was
no
necessity
for
a
garnishment
as
in
mrs.
lynch’s
and
mrs.
toro’s
case
for
example,
where
we
alleged
that
there
were
connecticut
wage
earners
raising
a
family
in
connecticut,
steadily
employed,
no
grounds
as
in
minnesota
for
example,
where
garnishment
is
permitted
only
where
there
maybe
some
danger
that
a
debtor
may
escape
from
the
jurisdiction.
they
have
service
of
process
or
fraudulently
conceals
his
assets.
mr.
david
m.
lesser
there
need
not
be
an
action
pending
first
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
david
m.
lesser
oh,
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
m.
lesser
that
is
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
in
most
other
states
the
garnishment
is
not
permitted
to
be
levied
unless
the
court
has
issued
the
written
and
there
is
a
civil
action
pending.
mr.
david
m.
lesser
in
connecticut
the
term
garnishment
--
mr.
david
m.
lesser
in
connecticut
the
term
garnishment
is
used
mr.
justice
stewart,
as
a
term
permitting
a
creditor
to
reach
debts
owing
to
a
debtor
which
are
in
the
hands
of
a
third
person
--
mr.
david
m.
lesser
we
have
a
--
we
have
alleged
in
these
cases
that
the
constitutional
deprivations
that
mrs.
lynch
and
mrs.
toro
have
suffered
is
indistinguishable
from
that
suffered
by
christine
sniadach,
the
only
difference
--
mr.
david
m.
lesser
wages
on
the
hands
of
an
employer,
mr.
justice,
are
exempt
from
garnishment
until
after
judgment,
and
then
it
is
called
an
execution.
mr.
david
m.
lesser
but
wages
deposited
in
accounts
--
mr.
david
m.
lesser
in
a
bank
account.
and
in
the
lynch
case,
i
think
the
parallel
of
christine
sniadach
is
most
clearly
appreciative.
her
employer
deducted
$10.00
of
her
$69.00
paycheck
each
week.
mr.
david
m.
lesser
and
automatically
deposited
in
a
credit
union
savings
account
after
place
of
employment.
now,
once
the
creditor
as
i
was
saying
--
mr.
david
m.
lesser
mr.
justice
blackmun,
there
is
a
statute,
section
352
i
believe
of
title
52,
which
sets
out
what
the
exemptions
are.
that
is
a
very
old
statute
and
the
relevant
portions
for
exemptions
are
necessary
tools
of
a
debtor’s
trade
and
necessary
household.
mr.
david
m.
lesser
only
after
judgment
when
wages
in
the
hands
of
an
employer
or
executed
upon,
is
there
any
exemption
i
believe
it
is
either
the
first
$65.00
of
the
wage
earner’s
net
income
is
exempt
or
25%
of
his
disposable
income
whichever
is
greater.
but
as
to
garnishments
on
wages
deposited
in
accounts
there
is
no
exemption.
now
if
the
creditor,
excuse
me,
if
the
debtor
attempts
to
raise
any
issues
with
respect
to
the
garnishment
in
the
creditor
suit,
there
is
no
authority
of
the
court
to
entertain
those
issues.
and
there
was
no
appeal
from
the
denial
of
relief
because
connecticut
does
not
permit
interlocutory
appeals
and
such
appeals
are
being
to
be
interlocutory.
there
are
only
two
questions
in
connecticut
which
a
debtor
can
raise
with
any
hope
of
getting
either
a
dissolution
or
a
reduction
of
the
garnishment.
we
have
discussed
those
on
pages
14
through
16
of
our
brief.
a
debtor
in
order
to
raise
these
issues
must
institute
separate
proceedings
pursuant
to
specific
statutes
by
serving
process
upon
the
creditor
or
his
attorney.
now,
he
can
complain
that
the
garnishment
unreasonably
exceeds
the
amount
that
the
creditor
himself
claims
as
damages.
but
the
court,
the
state
court
has
no
ability,
no
power
to
inquire
into
the
probable
validity
of
the
creditor’s
claim.
the
only
inquiry
is
directed
to
what
the
amount
of
the
creditor’s
claim
is.
in
mrs.
lynch’s
case
and
a
suit
on
a
note,
it
is
very
clear
what
the
creditor’s
claim
is,
the
garnishment
does
not
exceed
the
amount
which
the
creditor
claims
as
damages.
therefore,
mrs.
lynch
cannot
make
use
of
that
statute,
neither
could
mrs.
toro
for
the
same
reason
before
her
garnishment
was
released.
the
debtor
may
also
moved
to
substitute
a
bond
but
as
--
mr.
david
m.
lesser
mrs.
toro’s
particular
garnishment
has
been
released
mr.
justice
and
the
district
court
stated
that
this
raised
some
question
of
mootness
which
it
did
not
decide
but
as
our
prayers
for
relief
demonstrate,
pages
10
of
the
appendix
in
37
and
38,
we
were
also
looking
for
injunctions
against
garnishments
to
be
levied
by
deputy
sheriff
in
the
future
on
behalf
of
other
creditors
of
mrs.
lynch
and
mrs.
toro.
now,
aside
from
posting
a
bond
which
the
wage
earners
in
this
appeal
are
to
poor
to
afford
and
aside
from
the
reduction
of
the
garnishment
for
it
unreasonably
exceeds
the
amount
that
the
creditor
claims,
a
state
court
has
no
power
to
release
a
garnishment.
that
is
why
we
are
saying
that
the
district
court
was
in
error
in
these
cases.
i
think
that
the
procedure
in
connecticut
highlights
that
the
garnishments
in
these
cases
are
not
proceedings
in
a
state
court.
no
court
involvement
is
necessary
from
the
date
of
levy
until
final
disposition.
any
questions
relating
to
the
garnishment
must
be
raised
in
a
context
separate
from
the
creditor’s
suit.
the
connecticut
--
mr.
david
m.
lesser
i
think
that
this
case
would
be
different
with
respect
to
the
jurisdictional
point
mr.
justice
blackmun,
if
our
client
were
general
motors,
not
with
respect
to
the
2283
point.
if
i
may
just
--
mr.
david
m.
lesser
in
connecticut
there
is
a
statute,
section
337
(a)
of
title
52,
which
requires
a
court
order
for
garnishment
of
checking
accounts
to
the
extent
if
they
exceed
$5,000.
the
grounds
upon
which
in
order
to
an
issue
are
set
out
on
that
statute
in
parallel
seriously
and
very
closely,
the
procedure
in
a
number
of
other
states,
the
alleged
creditor
must
make
some
showing
that
the
debtor
is
about
to
abscond,
avoid
service
of
process,
or
conceal
his
property.
but
those
protections
are
not
available
to
low
income
wage
earners.
the
three-judge
court
in
this
case
dismissed
the
complaints
on
motions
to
dismiss
on
two
grounds:
first,
relying
on
the
second
circuit
decision
in
eisen
against
eastman,
the
three-judge
court
held
that
it
lack
subject
matter
jurisdiction
under
section
1343,
subsection
three
of
title
28,
on
the
ground
that
utmost
the
wage
earners
had
alleged
an
unconstitutional
deprivation,
a
substantial
question
of
an
unconstitutional
deprivation
of
their
property
valued
at
less
than
$10,000.
its
second
ground,
despite
its
recognition
that
summary
garnishments
are
levied
without
any
court
involvement
was
that
title
28
section
2283,
the
anti-injunction
statute
barred
a
relief.
now
the
rule
that
we
are
contending
for
with
respect
to
the
jurisdiction
point
and
we
think
that
this
rule
follows
directly
from
this
court
decisions
in
monroe
versus
pape
ten
years
ago,
is
that
whenever
a
natural
person
alleges
a
not
insubstantial
deprivation
of
his
fourteenth
amendment
rights
under
the
color
of
state
law,
sections
1983
and
1343
are
satisfied.
now
i
say
natural
person,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
do
not
think
that
this
case
needs
to
go
so
far
as
to
hold
the
general
motors
or
a
corporation
has
a
right
of
action.
mr.
david
m.
lesser
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
resume
my
discussion
of
the
denials
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
by
the
three-judge
district
court
which
was
the
first
ground
upon
which
it
denied
an
injunctive
relief
that
our
complaints
requested.
the
rule
which
we
are
proposing
that
this
court
hold
in
this
case
is
that
sections
1983
and
1343
be
satisfied
by
allegations
of
fourteenth
amendment
deprivations
by
persons
acting
in
the
color
of
state
law.
we
believe
that
this
rule
is
fully
supported.
the
only
reasonable
conclusion
from
the
examination
of
the
legislative
history
and
the
decisions
as
discussed
in
our
brief
and
our
reply
brief.
we
think
that
a
clear
enunciation
of
this
rule
would
have
the
very
great
advantage
of
ending
the
great
confusion
which
now
exists
in
the
different
circuits
as
to
the
scope
of
section
1343.
and
that
would
also
end
or
curtail
the
needless
litigation
which
has
resulted
from
that
confusion.
we
discussed
the
different
circuit’s
interpretation
and
how
inconsistent
they
are
with
one
another
in
pages
22
through
27
of
our
brief
and
then
in
our
replied
brief
at
page
15,
footnote
13.
as
to
the
second
ground
upon
which
the
district
court
denied
injunctive
relief
and
declaratory
relief,
the
ground
that
title
28
section
2283
--
mr.
david
m.
lesser
we
would
say
that
this
court
need
not
adopt
a
broad
rule
because
the
garnishments
in
these
cases
are
not
proceedings
pending
in
the
connecticut
courts.
the
connecticut
supreme
court
said
more
than
50
years
ago
in
the
case
of
sachs
against
nussenbaum
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
and
reply
brief
that
the
release
of
a
garnishment
has
no
effect
upon
the
pending
creditor’s
civil
suit.
no
state
court
interests
and
adjudication
would
the
affected
by
holding
that
the
garnishments
in
these
cases
are
not
proceedings
in
a
state
court,
because
they
are
not
under
the
control
of
the
state
court.
we
do
not
believe
that
in
this
case,
this
court
need
reach
the
question
of
whether
section
1983
is
an
expressly
authorized
exemption
to
section
2283,
even
though
we
feel
that
in
these
cases
we
have
shown
through
our
briefs
that
the
wage
earners
have
no
redress
in
the
state
courts.
and
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
case
of
michael's
jewelers
against
handy
cited
in
our
brief
in
which
after
the
sniadach
decision
a
low
income
debtor
challenge
the
very
statute,
title
52
section
329,
under
which
the
garnishments
in
this
cases
were
levied
on
the
ground
that
they
deprive
to
have
notice
and
hearing,
procedural
due
process.
mr.
david
m.
lesser
mr.
chief
justice,
if
garnishments
were
levied
after
notice
and
hearing
were
given
to
the
debtor,
we
would
say
that
that
would
meet
constitutional
safeguards,
but
that
issue
was
not
before
this
court,
the
reason
--
mr.
david
m.
lesser
yes
sir.
mr.
david
m.
lesser
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
david
m.
lesser
exactly
the
same
--
mr.
david
m.
lesser
we
would
be
asking
for
exactly
the
same
protection
accorded
to
christine
sniadach.
several
state
courts
have
held
prejudgment
attachment
and
garnishment
unconstitutional.
this,
the
resolution
of
the
constitutional
issue,
is
not
before
this
court
however.
i
have
raised
--
i
have
explained
the
practice
of
prejudgment
garnishment
in
order
to
give
context
to
our
claims
that
garnishment
is
not
a
proceeding
in
a
state
court.
and
the
severe
deprivations
that
result
from
excluding
mrs.
lynch
and
mrs.
toro
from
a
federal
forum.
if
this
case
is
remanded
then
the
district
court
will
reach
the
constitutional
issues
and
we
will
be
able
to
litigate
them
there
but
the
three-judge
court
itself
recognized,
although
it
did
not
reach
the
constitutional
issue
and
decided,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
wage
earners
had
raised
substantial
constitutional
issues
in
light
of
this
court’s
decision
in
the
sniadach
case,
but
that
--
whether
the
constitutional
principal
ultimately
at
issue
here
would
involve
an
extension
of
sniadach.
it
is
not
before
the
court
--
mr.
david
m.
lesser
yes,
mr.--
mr.
david
m.
lesser
that
is
right
mr.
justice
brennan.
also
that
the
three-judge
court
was
in
error
in
holding
that
section
2283
barred
relief.
and
although
the
opinion
of
the
three-judge
court
is
not
entirely
clear.
it
seems
to
us
that
a
reading
of
it
will
indicate
that
the
three-judge
court
did
not
hold
summary
garnishments
to
be
proceedings
in
the
state
court.
the
way
we
read
the
opinion
mr.
justice
is
that
the
three-judge
court
felt
that
enjoin
--
that
releasing
garnishments
would
probably
interfere
with
the
existing
creditor’s
suit.
this
was
on
motions
to
dismiss
and
additionally
the
connecticut
supreme
court
itself
has
held
in
the
sachs
case
that
release
does
not
affect
the
creditor’s
suit.
it
is
an
entirely
different
matter.
finally,
as
to
our
2283
point,
we
do
not
believe
under
any
circumstances
that
section
2283
would
bar
an
injunction
against
connecticut
deputy
sheriffs
from
filing
future
summary
garnishments
in
proceedings,
existing
creditor’s
suits.
it
is
not
yet
instituted
by
other
creditors
of
mrs.
lynch
and
mrs.
toro.
in
conclusion,
the
only
question
before
this
court
is
whether
congress
intended
mrs.
lynch’s
and
mrs.
toro’s
complaints
to
be
heard
in
a
federal
forum.
we
submit
that
since
they
have
alleged
substantial
fourteenth
amendment
violations
and
that
they
have
no
redress
in
the
courts
of
connecticut,
there
claims
must
be
heard
in
a
federal
court.
we,
therefore,
ask
this
court
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
three-judge
court
below
and
to
remand
it
for
resolution
of
the
merits.
thank
you.
mr.
david
m.
lesser
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
to
the
question
of
whether
relief
lies
in
the
connecticut
courts,
i
would
first
like
to
make
the
point
that
any
such
affirmative
actions
would
of
course
be
entirely
separate
proceedings
against
which
no
injunction
is
being
sought.
now,
as
to
the
michael’s
jewelers
case,
there
the
appellate
court,
the
appellate
division
of
circuit
court
held
that
no
appeal
would
lie
from
the
refusal
of
the
lower
court
to
dissolve
the
garnishment
on
the
ground
that
it
is
was
levied
without
notice
or
hearing.
the
appellate
court
held
that
the
three
--
that
the
circuit
court,
the
lower
court,
had
no
authority
to
entertain
any
relief
and
then
it
said,
but
at
any
rate
connecticut
statutes
providing
for
prejudgment
garnishment
of
accounts
is
constitutional
distinguishing
sniadach.
mr.
david
m.
lesser
no
i
do
not.
mr.
david
m.
lesser
i
do
not
believe
that
a
counterclaim
would
lie
in
the
sixth
circuit
court
action
where
the
creditors
service
pending
against
mrs.
lynch,
mr.
chief
justice.
a
counterclaim
must
be
related
to
the
matter
in
demand.
that
is
the
way
the
practice
book
reads.
i
believe
that
section
124
of
the
connecticut
practice
book
in
it
--
mr.
david
m.
lesser
the
garnishment
would
be
unrelated
to
the
complaints
that
alleged.
that
is,
the
claim
of
household
finance
corporation
that
money
is
doing
owing
from
a
note.
the
only
case
i
have
been
able
to
find
is
the
case
called
the
bank
against
riley
(ph)
reported
in
12
connecticut
supplement
in
which
it
was
held
that
a
counterclaim
in
those
circumstances
would
not
lie.
now
--
but
at
any
rate,
it
would
seem
that
the
issues
in
the
circuit
court
have
been
settled
by
michael’s
jewelers
one
way
or
another.
either
the
court
cannot
entertain
the
complaint,
the
motion
to
dissolve
the
garnishment
or
if
it
can
--
if
it
can
entertain
it
nevertheless,
garnishment
is
still
constitutional.
and
let
me
simply
refer
the
court
to
our
reply
brief
at
pages
23
and
24
in
which
we
set
out
the
substantial
cause
of
litigating
in
the
connecticut
courts
in
order
to
bring
a
suit
for
declaratory
judgment.
for
example,
it
is
necessary
as
a
jurisdictional
requirement
to
notify
all
interested
parties
which
carries
a
substantial
cause.
now,
the
connecticut
supreme
court
has,
during
all
the
years
of
this
century,
affirmed
the
constitutionality
of
summary
prejudgment
garnishment.
not
since
sniadach;
that
is
true,
but
in
the
michael’s
jewelers
case
the
appellate
court
opinion,
the
appellate
court
did
not
certify
that
a
substantial
question
of
law
was
involved
thereby
making
an
appeal
to
the
connecticut
supreme
court
impossible.
what
occurred
in
that
case
was
i
suppose
an
equivalent
of
certiorari,
the
debtor
filed
a
petition
for
certification
to
the
connecticut
supreme
court
but
that
was
never
acted
upon
because
then
the
creditor
withdrew
his
underlying
damage
suit.
i
would
finally
like
to
the
state
that
a
lawyer
is
not
a
ministerial
officer
of
the
court
and
i
would
refer
the
--
and
neither
is
a
sheriff.
the
sheriff
is
acting
under
the
instructions
of
the
lawyer
who,
under
the
decisions
of
the
connecticut
supreme
court,
has
full
absolute
discretion
in
levying
a
writ
of
garnishment.
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
sachs
case
again,
volume
92,
connecticut,
page
16
of
our
brief,
in
a
case
which
is
not
in
any
of
our
briefs,
sharkovitz
(ph)
against
smith
in
volume
143
of
connecticut
reports.
we
also
state
in
our
brief
that
even
if
the
garnishment
represents
an
abuse
of
process,
the
state
court
is
barred
from
releasing
that
garnishment.
thus
under
hill
against
martin
we
would
say
that
there
is
no
action
by
the
court
or
any
of
its
ministerial
officers
and
therefore
garnishment
is
not
a
proceeding
in
the
state
court.
as
to
the
remarks
on
jurisdiction,
we
will
rest
on
our
argument
and
our
briefs
unless
there
are
further
questions.
thank
you
very
much
for
the
opportunity
of
being
here.
mr.
david
m.
lesser
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
under
title
28,
section
1253,
from
the
judgment
of
the
three-judge
district
court
in
the
district
of
connecticut
which
denied
injunctive
and
declaratory
relief.
the
issue
is
whether
the
federal
courts
are
powerless
to
award
any
redress
to
low
income
wage
earners
whose
earnings
on
deposit
are
summarily
garnished
by
connecticut
deputy
sheriffs
without
any
notice,
hearing,
or
order
of
the
state
court.
mr.
david
m.
lesser
i
would
like
mr.
chief
justice
to
begin
answering
that
question
and
then
explain
the
connecticut
practice
of
summary
prejudgment
garnishment
in
some
detail
because
it
is
quite
unusual.
mr.
david
m.
lesser
in
connecticut,
an
alleged
creditor
and
his
attorney
has
absolute
discretion
prior
to
instituting
suit
against
the
debtor
to
summarily
garnish
earnings
in
his
account
without
any
involvement
of
the
court.
the
garnishment
occurs
before
process
is
served
upon
the
debtor.
the
attorney
for
the
alleged
creditor
instructs
deputy
sheriffs
to
levy
the
garnishment
by
serving
a
writ
of
garnishment
on
the
garnishee
bank.
mr.
david
m.
lesser
judgment
is
obtained
perhaps
several
years
after
civil
action
is
commenced
by
service
of
process
on
the
debtor
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
david
m.
lesser
and
a
checking
account,
mr.
justice.
mr.
david
m.
lesser
he
does
not
immediately
need
to
file.
mr.
david
m.
lesser
under
the
applicable
statutes,
section
329
of
title
52
and
section
48
(a)
of
title
52.
it
would
be
possible
for
the
garnishment
to
be
levied
for
example
on
day
one
for
the
alleged
debtor
to
be
served
with
process,
let
us
say,
on
day
45
or
50
and
for
process
to
be
docketed
in
the
state
court,
let
us
say,
on
day
55.
mr.
david
m.
lesser
one
never
gets
into
the
state
court
on
a
garnishment
mr.
justice
brennan
to
raise
any
questions
with
respect
to
that
garnishment.
now
--
mr.
david
m.
lesser
that
is
correct
mr.
justice,
and
i
would
like
to
explain
that.
connecticut
appears
to
be
the
only
state
in
which
an
alleged
creditor
and
his
attorney
are
permitted
in
their
absolute
discretion
to
levy
and
maintain
a
garnishment
until
final
disposition
of
the
creditor
suit
without
any
involvement
of
the
state
court.
most
other
states
require
the
creditor
to
get
some
sort
of
court
approval
before
garnishment
either
in
the
form
of
posting
a
bond,
filing
an
affidavit
and
so
far
as
we
know
in
all
other
states,
the
writ
of
garnishment
must
be
signed
or
issued
by
a
judge
or
clerk
of
court.
none
of
that
obtains
here.
now,
once
the
creditor’s
civil
suit
for
damages
is
docketed,
no
questions
relating
to
the
garnishment
can
be
considered
in
the
context
of
the
creditor’s
pending
suit.
if
the
debtor
claims
that
the
garnishment
was
levied
without
any
probable
validity,
that
the
creditors
claim
has
no
merit
or
that
there
was
no
necessity
for
a
garnishment
as
in
mrs.
lynch’s
and
mrs.
toro’s
case
for
example,
where
we
alleged
that
there
were
connecticut
wage
earners
raising
a
family
in
connecticut,
steadily
employed,
no
grounds
as
in
minnesota
for
example,
where
garnishment
is
permitted
only
where
there
maybe
some
danger
that
a
debtor
may
escape
from
the
jurisdiction.
they
have
service
of
process
or
fraudulently
conceals
his
assets.
mr.
david
m.
lesser
there
need
not
be
an
action
pending
first
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
david
m.
lesser
oh,
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
m.
lesser
that
is
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
in
most
other
states
the
garnishment
is
not
permitted
to
be
levied
unless
the
court
has
issued
the
written
and
there
is
a
civil
action
pending.
mr.
david
m.
lesser
in
connecticut
the
term
garnishment
--
mr.
david
m.
lesser
in
connecticut
the
term
garnishment
is
used
mr.
justice
stewart,
as
a
term
permitting
a
creditor
to
reach
debts
owing
to
a
debtor
which
are
in
the
hands
of
a
third
person
--
mr.
david
m.
lesser
we
have
a
--
we
have
alleged
in
these
cases
that
the
constitutional
deprivations
that
mrs.
lynch
and
mrs.
toro
have
suffered
is
indistinguishable
from
that
suffered
by
christine
sniadach,
the
only
difference
--
mr.
david
m.
lesser
wages
on
the
hands
of
an
employer,
mr.
justice,
are
exempt
from
garnishment
until
after
judgment,
and
then
it
is
called
an
execution.
mr.
david
m.
lesser
but
wages
deposited
in
accounts
--
mr.
david
m.
lesser
in
a
bank
account.
and
in
the
lynch
case,
i
think
the
parallel
of
christine
sniadach
is
most
clearly
appreciative.
her
employer
deducted
$10.00
of
her
$69.00
paycheck
each
week.
mr.
david
m.
lesser
and
automatically
deposited
in
a
credit
union
savings
account
after
place
of
employment.
now,
once
the
creditor
as
i
was
saying
--
mr.
david
m.
lesser
mr.
justice
blackmun,
there
is
a
statute,
section
352
i
believe
of
title
52,
which
sets
out
what
the
exemptions
are.
that
is
a
very
old
statute
and
the
relevant
portions
for
exemptions
are
necessary
tools
of
a
debtor’s
trade
and
necessary
household.
mr.
david
m.
lesser
only
after
judgment
when
wages
in
the
hands
of
an
employer
or
executed
upon,
is
there
any
exemption
i
believe
it
is
either
the
first
$65.00
of
the
wage
earner’s
net
income
is
exempt
or
25%
of
his
disposable
income
whichever
is
greater.
but
as
to
garnishments
on
wages
deposited
in
accounts
there
is
no
exemption.
now
if
the
creditor,
excuse
me,
if
the
debtor
attempts
to
raise
any
issues
with
respect
to
the
garnishment
in
the
creditor
suit,
there
is
no
authority
of
the
court
to
entertain
those
issues.
and
there
was
no
appeal
from
the
denial
of
relief
because
connecticut
does
not
permit
interlocutory
appeals
and
such
appeals
are
being
to
be
interlocutory.
there
are
only
two
questions
in
connecticut
which
a
debtor
can
raise
with
any
hope
of
getting
either
a
dissolution
or
a
reduction
of
the
garnishment.
we
have
discussed
those
on
pages
14
through
16
of
our
brief.
a
debtor
in
order
to
raise
these
issues
must
institute
separate
proceedings
pursuant
to
specific
statutes
by
serving
process
upon
the
creditor
or
his
attorney.
now,
he
can
complain
that
the
garnishment
unreasonably
exceeds
the
amount
that
the
creditor
himself
claims
as
damages.
but
the
court,
the
state
court
has
no
ability,
no
power
to
inquire
into
the
probable
validity
of
the
creditor’s
claim.
the
only
inquiry
is
directed
to
what
the
amount
of
the
creditor’s
claim
is.
in
mrs.
lynch’s
case
and
a
suit
on
a
note,
it
is
very
clear
what
the
creditor’s
claim
is,
the
garnishment
does
not
exceed
the
amount
which
the
creditor
claims
as
damages.
therefore,
mrs.
lynch
cannot
make
use
of
that
statute,
neither
could
mrs.
toro
for
the
same
reason
before
her
garnishment
was
released.
the
debtor
may
also
moved
to
substitute
a
bond
but
as
--
mr.
david
m.
lesser
mrs.
toro’s
particular
garnishment
has
been
released
mr.
justice
and
the
district
court
stated
that
this
raised
some
question
of
mootness
which
it
did
not
decide
but
as
our
prayers
for
relief
demonstrate,
pages
10
of
the
appendix
in
37
and
38,
we
were
also
looking
for
injunctions
against
garnishments
to
be
levied
by
deputy
sheriff
in
the
future
on
behalf
of
other
creditors
of
mrs.
lynch
and
mrs.
toro.
now,
aside
from
posting
a
bond
which
the
wage
earners
in
this
appeal
are
to
poor
to
afford
and
aside
from
the
reduction
of
the
garnishment
for
it
unreasonably
exceeds
the
amount
that
the
creditor
claims,
a
state
court
has
no
power
to
release
a
garnishment.
that
is
why
we
are
saying
that
the
district
court
was
in
error
in
these
cases.
i
think
that
the
procedure
in
connecticut
highlights
that
the
garnishments
in
these
cases
are
not
proceedings
in
a
state
court.
no
court
involvement
is
necessary
from
the
date
of
levy
until
final
disposition.
any
questions
relating
to
the
garnishment
must
be
raised
in
a
context
separate
from
the
creditor’s
suit.
the
connecticut
--
mr.
david
m.
lesser
i
think
that
this
case
would
be
different
with
respect
to
the
jurisdictional
point
mr.
justice
blackmun,
if
our
client
were
general
motors,
not
with
respect
to
the
2283
point.
if
i
may
just
--
mr.
david
m.
lesser
in
connecticut
there
is
a
statute,
section
337
(a)
of
title
52,
which
requires
a
court
order
for
garnishment
of
checking
accounts
to
the
extent
if
they
exceed
$5,000.
the
grounds
upon
which
in
order
to
an
issue
are
set
out
on
that
statute
in
parallel
seriously
and
very
closely,
the
procedure
in
a
number
of
other
states,
the
alleged
creditor
must
make
some
showing
that
the
debtor
is
about
to
abscond,
avoid
service
of
process,
or
conceal
his
property.
but
those
protections
are
not
available
to
low
income
wage
earners.
the
three-judge
court
in
this
case
dismissed
the
complaints
on
motions
to
dismiss
on
two
grounds:
first,
relying
on
the
second
circuit
decision
in
eisen
against
eastman,
the
three-judge
court
held
that
it
lack
subject
matter
jurisdiction
under
section
1343,
subsection
three
of
title
28,
on
the
ground
that
utmost
the
wage
earners
had
alleged
an
unconstitutional
deprivation,
a
substantial
question
of
an
unconstitutional
deprivation
of
their
property
valued
at
less
than
$10,000.
its
second
ground,
despite
its
recognition
that
summary
garnishments
are
levied
without
any
court
involvement
was
that
title
28
section
2283,
the
anti-injunction
statute
barred
a
relief.
now
the
rule
that
we
are
contending
for
with
respect
to
the
jurisdiction
point
and
we
think
that
this
rule
follows
directly
from
this
court
decisions
in
monroe
versus
pape
ten
years
ago,
is
that
whenever
a
natural
person
alleges
a
not
insubstantial
deprivation
of
his
fourteenth
amendment
rights
under
the
color
of
state
law,
sections
1983
and
1343
are
satisfied.
now
i
say
natural
person,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
do
not
think
that
this
case
needs
to
go
so
far
as
to
hold
the
general
motors
or
a
corporation
has
a
right
of
action.
mr.
david
m.
lesser
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
resume
my
discussion
of
the
denials
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
by
the
three-judge
district
court
which
was
the
first
ground
upon
which
it
denied
an
injunctive
relief
that
our
complaints
requested.
the
rule
which
we
are
proposing
that
this
court
hold
in
this
case
is
that
sections
1983
and
1343
be
satisfied
by
allegations
of
fourteenth
amendment
deprivations
by
persons
acting
in
the
color
of
state
law.
we
believe
that
this
rule
is
fully
supported.
the
only
reasonable
conclusion
from
the
examination
of
the
legislative
history
and
the
decisions
as
discussed
in
our
brief
and
our
reply
brief.
we
think
that
a
clear
enunciation
of
this
rule
would
have
the
very
great
advantage
of
ending
the
great
confusion
which
now
exists
in
the
different
circuits
as
to
the
scope
of
section
1343.
and
that
would
also
end
or
curtail
the
needless
litigation
which
has
resulted
from
that
confusion.
we
discussed
the
different
circuit’s
interpretation
and
how
inconsistent
they
are
with
one
another
in
pages
22
through
27
of
our
brief
and
then
in
our
replied
brief
at
page
15,
footnote
13.
as
to
the
second
ground
upon
which
the
district
court
denied
injunctive
relief
and
declaratory
relief,
the
ground
that
title
28
section
2283
--
mr.
david
m.
lesser
we
would
say
that
this
court
need
not
adopt
a
broad
rule
because
the
garnishments
in
these
cases
are
not
proceedings
pending
in
the
connecticut
courts.
the
connecticut
supreme
court
said
more
than
50
years
ago
in
the
case
of
sachs
against
nussenbaum
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
and
reply
brief
that
the
release
of
a
garnishment
has
no
effect
upon
the
pending
creditor’s
civil
suit.
no
state
court
interests
and
adjudication
would
the
affected
by
holding
that
the
garnishments
in
these
cases
are
not
proceedings
in
a
state
court,
because
they
are
not
under
the
control
of
the
state
court.
we
do
not
believe
that
in
this
case,
this
court
need
reach
the
question
of
whether
section
1983
is
an
expressly
authorized
exemption
to
section
2283,
even
though
we
feel
that
in
these
cases
we
have
shown
through
our
briefs
that
the
wage
earners
have
no
redress
in
the
state
courts.
and
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
case
of
michael's
jewelers
against
handy
cited
in
our
brief
in
which
after
the
sniadach
decision
a
low
income
debtor
challenge
the
very
statute,
title
52
section
329,
under
which
the
garnishments
in
this
cases
were
levied
on
the
ground
that
they
deprive
to
have
notice
and
hearing,
procedural
due
process.
mr.
david
m.
lesser
mr.
chief
justice,
if
garnishments
were
levied
after
notice
and
hearing
were
given
to
the
debtor,
we
would
say
that
that
would
meet
constitutional
safeguards,
but
that
issue
was
not
before
this
court,
the
reason
--
mr.
david
m.
lesser
yes
sir.
mr.
david
m.
lesser
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
david
m.
lesser
exactly
the
same
--
mr.
david
m.
lesser
we
would
be
asking
for
exactly
the
same
protection
accorded
to
christine
sniadach.
several
state
courts
have
held
prejudgment
attachment
and
garnishment
unconstitutional.
this,
the
resolution
of
the
constitutional
issue,
is
not
before
this
court
however.
i
have
raised
--
i
have
explained
the
practice
of
prejudgment
garnishment
in
order
to
give
context
to
our
claims
that
garnishment
is
not
a
proceeding
in
a
state
court.
and
the
severe
deprivations
that
result
from
excluding
mrs.
lynch
and
mrs.
toro
from
a
federal
forum.
if
this
case
is
remanded
then
the
district
court
will
reach
the
constitutional
issues
and
we
will
be
able
to
litigate
them
there
but
the
three-judge
court
itself
recognized,
although
it
did
not
reach
the
constitutional
issue
and
decided,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
wage
earners
had
raised
substantial
constitutional
issues
in
light
of
this
court’s
decision
in
the
sniadach
case,
but
that
--
whether
the
constitutional
principal
ultimately
at
issue
here
would
involve
an
extension
of
sniadach.
it
is
not
before
the
court
--
mr.
david
m.
lesser
yes,
mr.--
mr.
david
m.
lesser
that
is
right
mr.
justice
brennan.
also
that
the
three-judge
court
was
in
error
in
holding
that
section
2283
barred
relief.
and
although
the
opinion
of
the
three-judge
court
is
not
entirely
clear.
it
seems
to
us
that
a
reading
of
it
will
indicate
that
the
three-judge
court
did
not
hold
summary
garnishments
to
be
proceedings
in
the
state
court.
the
way
we
read
the
opinion
mr.
justice
is
that
the
three-judge
court
felt
that
enjoin
--
that
releasing
garnishments
would
probably
interfere
with
the
existing
creditor’s
suit.
this
was
on
motions
to
dismiss
and
additionally
the
connecticut
supreme
court
itself
has
held
in
the
sachs
case
that
release
does
not
affect
the
creditor’s
suit.
it
is
an
entirely
different
matter.
finally,
as
to
our
2283
point,
we
do
not
believe
under
any
circumstances
that
section
2283
would
bar
an
injunction
against
connecticut
deputy
sheriffs
from
filing
future
summary
garnishments
in
proceedings,
existing
creditor’s
suits.
it
is
not
yet
instituted
by
other
creditors
of
mrs.
lynch
and
mrs.
toro.
in
conclusion,
the
only
question
before
this
court
is
whether
congress
intended
mrs.
lynch’s
and
mrs.
toro’s
complaints
to
be
heard
in
a
federal
forum.
we
submit
that
since
they
have
alleged
substantial
fourteenth
amendment
violations
and
that
they
have
no
redress
in
the
courts
of
connecticut,
there
claims
must
be
heard
in
a
federal
court.
we,
therefore,
ask
this
court
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
three-judge
court
below
and
to
remand
it
for
resolution
of
the
merits.
thank
you.
mr.
david
m.
lesser
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
to
the
question
of
whether
relief
lies
in
the
connecticut
courts,
i
would
first
like
to
make
the
point
that
any
such
affirmative
actions
would
of
course
be
entirely
separate
proceedings
against
which
no
injunction
is
being
sought.
now,
as
to
the
michael’s
jewelers
case,
there
the
appellate
court,
the
appellate
division
of
circuit
court
held
that
no
appeal
would
lie
from
the
refusal
of
the
lower
court
to
dissolve
the
garnishment
on
the
ground
that
it
is
was
levied
without
notice
or
hearing.
the
appellate
court
held
that
the
three
--
that
the
circuit
court,
the
lower
court,
had
no
authority
to
entertain
any
relief
and
then
it
said,
but
at
any
rate
connecticut
statutes
providing
for
prejudgment
garnishment
of
accounts
is
constitutional
distinguishing
sniadach.
mr.
david
m.
lesser
no
i
do
not.
mr.
david
m.
lesser
i
do
not
believe
that
a
counterclaim
would
lie
in
the
sixth
circuit
court
action
where
the
creditors
service
pending
against
mrs.
lynch,
mr.
chief
justice.
a
counterclaim
must
be
related
to
the
matter
in
demand.
that
is
the
way
the
practice
book
reads.
i
believe
that
section
124
of
the
connecticut
practice
book
in
it
--
mr.
david
m.
lesser
the
garnishment
would
be
unrelated
to
the
complaints
that
alleged.
that
is,
the
claim
of
household
finance
corporation
that
money
is
doing
owing
from
a
note.
the
only
case
i
have
been
able
to
find
is
the
case
called
the
bank
against
riley
(ph)
reported
in
12
connecticut
supplement
in
which
it
was
held
that
a
counterclaim
in
those
circumstances
would
not
lie.
now
--
but
at
any
rate,
it
would
seem
that
the
issues
in
the
circuit
court
have
been
settled
by
michael’s
jewelers
one
way
or
another.
either
the
court
cannot
entertain
the
complaint,
the
motion
to
dissolve
the
garnishment
or
if
it
can
--
if
it
can
entertain
it
nevertheless,
garnishment
is
still
constitutional.
and
let
me
simply
refer
the
court
to
our
reply
brief
at
pages
23
and
24
in
which
we
set
out
the
substantial
cause
of
litigating
in
the
connecticut
courts
in
order
to
bring
a
suit
for
declaratory
judgment.
for
example,
it
is
necessary
as
a
jurisdictional
requirement
to
notify
all
interested
parties
which
carries
a
substantial
cause.
now,
the
connecticut
supreme
court
has,
during
all
the
years
of
this
century,
affirmed
the
constitutionality
of
summary
prejudgment
garnishment.
not
since
sniadach;
that
is
true,
but
in
the
michael’s
jewelers
case
the
appellate
court
opinion,
the
appellate
court
did
not
certify
that
a
substantial
question
of
law
was
involved
thereby
making
an
appeal
to
the
connecticut
supreme
court
impossible.
what
occurred
in
that
case
was
i
suppose
an
equivalent
of
certiorari,
the
debtor
filed
a
petition
for
certification
to
the
connecticut
supreme
court
but
that
was
never
acted
upon
because
then
the
creditor
withdrew
his
underlying
damage
suit.
i
would
finally
like
to
the
state
that
a
lawyer
is
not
a
ministerial
officer
of
the
court
and
i
would
refer
the
--
and
neither
is
a
sheriff.
the
sheriff
is
acting
under
the
instructions
of
the
lawyer
who,
under
the
decisions
of
the
connecticut
supreme
court,
has
full
absolute
discretion
in
levying
a
writ
of
garnishment.
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
sachs
case
again,
volume
92,
connecticut,
page
16
of
our
brief,
in
a
case
which
is
not
in
any
of
our
briefs,
sharkovitz
(ph)
against
smith
in
volume
143
of
connecticut
reports.
we
also
state
in
our
brief
that
even
if
the
garnishment
represents
an
abuse
of
process,
the
state
court
is
barred
from
releasing
that
garnishment.
thus
under
hill
against
martin
we
would
say
that
there
is
no
action
by
the
court
or
any
of
its
ministerial
officers
and
therefore
garnishment
is
not
a
proceeding
in
the
state
court.
as
to
the
remarks
on
jurisdiction,
we
will
rest
on
our
argument
and
our
briefs
unless
there
are
further
questions.
thank
you
very
much
for
the
opportunity
of
being
here.
