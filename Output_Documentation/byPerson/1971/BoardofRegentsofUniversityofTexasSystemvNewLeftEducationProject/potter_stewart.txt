and
if
that's

they

but
no

no

yes.
well,
the

didn't
really
enter
summary
judgment
in
their

the
defendants

as
you

as
you've
already
told
us.
they

are
the

a
group
and
the
b
group
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
understand
your
contention.
justice
potter
stewart
the
--
the
court
says
that
it
--
that
it
dismissed
the
--
the
new
left
education
project,
plaintiffs
dismissed
them
as
plaintiffs.
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
there'd
be
no
interference
with
the
state
judge
of
adjudication.
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
reading
from
page
165
of
the
appendix
which
is
the
--
from
now,
i
think
the
final
memorandum
opinion
of
the
three-judge
court.
justice
potter
stewart
or
this
has
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
sort
of
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
double
talk,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
they
dismissed
and
then
they
save
it.
well,
now
we
don't
dismiss.
justice

can
you

justice

now
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
according

according
to
your

there
is
a
good

the
poor

justice

(voice

justice

stewart
that's
why
you
made
that
concession
in
your
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
all
--
are
all
the
others
fully
supported
by
the

to
the

that
the
university

texas
is

and
there
are
how
many,

at

were
told

there's
17
units
in
the
university
of
texas.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
this
was
their
lawsuit.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
--
justice
potter

then
as
we've
already
seen,
it's
some
question
about
whether
or
not
they
were
dismissed
from
it.
justice
potter
stewart
your
suggestion
is
that
analytically,
this
thing
will
simplify
itself
if
we
look
in

at

this
is
two
separate
lawsuits

forget
all
about

that
it?
