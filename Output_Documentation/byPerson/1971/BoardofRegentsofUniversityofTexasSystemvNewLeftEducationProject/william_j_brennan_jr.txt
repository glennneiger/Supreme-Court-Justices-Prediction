j.
brennan,

well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
are
there
any
state-supported
universities
and
colleges
to
which
these
regulations
do
not
apply?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let
me
put
it
another
way.
and
do
they
--
do
these
rules
and
regulations
apply
to
all
units,
all
colleges
and
universities
within
this
particular
system?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
those
the
ones
that
communities
you
mentioned,
galveston
etcetera?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
they
are
all
the
university
of
texas,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
other
state
supported
colleges
and
universities
are
what,
are
they
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
the
relationship
of
this
other
state
university,
the
sate
supported
universities
and
colleges
to
the
university
of
texas
system?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
there's
no
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there's
no
common
board
of
education
for
all
of
them?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
there
is
for
all
purposes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
their
overall
agency
as
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
--
that
super
--
has
something
to
do
with
every
state
supported
colleges
and
universities.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
--
is
that
all
that's
involved
here,
whether
or
not
the
university
or
the
regents
may
specify
the
places
where
these
papers
maybe
sold?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i
mean
is
that
all
that's
been
done?
i
--
i
had
the
impression
that
one
of
this
also
had
something
to
do
with
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
solicitation
of
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
what
specifically
are
we
concerned
with?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
not
solicit
memberships.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
would
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
are
these
two
organizations
satisfied?
number
one,
to
limit
the
places
to
where
the
regulation
says
they
may
have
booth,
and
number
two,
to
solicit
both
membership
and
the
payment
of
membership
fees
at
that
place?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
all
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
don't
--
you
don't
ask
to
roam
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
so
what
happens
on
the
mall
where,
i
gather,
all
these
booths
are
--
are
located?
would
your
folks
stay
within
the
booth
or
do
they
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
people
come
to
the
card
table?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it
isn't
that
representatives
go
up
and
down
that
button
hole
streets
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
walking
across
them
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

i'm
trying

justice
william
j.

i'm
trying
to
switch
as
you
keep
pressing
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
--
i
just
don't
have
a
clear
picture
of
what
it
is
that
goes
on
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
your
clients,
the
socialists
and
the
democrats
applied
for
a
permanent
at
a
booth
“merely
to
the
specific
political
literature,”
would
that
have
been
granted?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
that,
what
you
--
what
you
added
to
it
was
not
only
that
you
want
from
--
at
that
place
to
--
distribute
political
literature
but
also
to
be
allowed
to
solicit
memberships
and
solicit
the
payment
of
membership
fees,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
those
were
the
two
things
that
were
denied.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
they
gave
them
away,
they
could
--
but
they
couldn't
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
really,
what
--
what
--
whether
it
comes
down
to
that,
what
your
suggesting
is
all
we
have
before
us
is
a
regulation
which
denies
these
organizations,
the
right
to
solicit
membership
and
to
solicit
fees
and
to
sell
their
political
literature.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
you
don't
deny
that
in
a
sense
it's
commercial
solicitation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
had
as
--
aspect
but
you
say
it's
political
expression
and
--
and
for
that
reason,
could
take
the
(inaudible)
of
first
amendment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
richards,
i'm
looking
at
the
judgment
at
page
176
of
the
record.
if
i
--
if
i
understand
your
position
now,
your
only
real
complaint
is
that
you
could
have
the
booths
in
this
and
do
certain
things
but
they
wouldn't
let
you
do
--
do
these
other
things.
of
course
--
doesn't
this
judgment
declare
these
rules
and
regulations
invalid
on
the
face?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
rather
--
is
that
rather
more
relief
than
you
were
entitled
to?
i
mean
or
--
or
--
is
the
university
now
without
any
regulations
in
this
field
at
all
under
this
judgement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
its
--
was
that
required
to
give
you
the
least
one?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
i
know
that
it
says
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

yes,

what
i
was
looking
at.
justice
william
j.

yes.

yes.

look
