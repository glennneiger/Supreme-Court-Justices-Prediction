mr.
david
r.
richards
yes.
mr.
chief
justice
and
--
excuse
me,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
a
series
of
initial
procedural
and
jurisdictional
questions.
if
they
are
ever
answered
suitably,
then
the
--
the
case
then
presents
a
rather
clear
first
amendment
question
regarding
the
extent
to
which
a
state
university
may
restrict
the
legitimate
first
amendment
activities
of
student
political
organizations
on
campus.
mr.
david
r.
richards
i
agree
that
the
balance
may
be
struck
and
that
clearly,
that
the
rights
are
not
absolute
and
that
the
right
to
maintain
the
institution
and
to
operate
it
still
be
or
at
least
may
be
paramount
if
not
certainly,
it
must
be
given
this
way.
we
say
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
specifically,
we're
concerned
here,
as
--
as
we
understood,
the
first
amendment
issue.
we
have
two
organizations
that
are
here
before
the
court,
the
young
democrats
and
the
young
socialist,
registered
student
organizations,
long
time
participants
on
the
campus.
they
have
sought
the
right
to
solicit
membership
dues
in
the
same
areas
of
the
campus
to
with
the
malls
in
which
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
memberships
and
membership
dues,
excuse
me.
memberships
and
membership
dues
because
i
--
i
say
this
advisably
because
the
nature
of
the
regulation
is
such
that
they
are
now
permitted
under
the
regulation
to
establish
a
booth.
they
may
maintain
a
booth
on
the
mall,
they
distribute
literature,
but
they
say
the
organization
may
not,
at
the
same
time
say
to
that
person,
“join
our
organization,
here's
a
membership
card,
pay
us
two
bucks.”
they
say
that's
commercial
--
falls
avowal
of
the
commercial
regulations.
so,
really,
all
they're
saying
is
that
we
want
to
carry
out
the
full
range
of
our
activities
which
are
legitimate,
that
is
solicit
membership
dues
in
the
same
locations
where
we're
permitted
to
carry
out
other
kinds.
they
can
set
up
a
booth,
set
up
--
circulate
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
--
competition
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
this
has
been
the
position
from
the
outset
as
i
understood.
the
--
what
we've
argued
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
essentially,
we
were
looking
--
well,
i
mean
i
shouldn't
and
we
--
we
also
argued
for
the
right
to
sell
political
literature
from
that
same
booth
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
not
--
we've
never
asked
the
right
to
roam
the
campus
and
never
suggested
that
that
was
necessary,
the
malls
are
wide
and
open,
there's
movement
there
all
the
time.
there
are
other
activities
of
a
comparable
nature
and
all
we
wanted
to
--
to
do
was
to
flesh
out
our
entire
activities
by
at
least
soliciting
dues.
it's
the
only
logical
place
to
do
so
frankly.
it's
the
only
place
we
see
the
--
see
the
students
to
whom
we
appeal.
mr.
david
r.
richards
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
r.
richards
it
has
never
--
our
contention
has
been
the
former.
that
is
that
we
sought
to
do,
perform
these
activities
in
the
same
areas
from
the
same
type
of
booth
we
are
now
functioning
from
for
other
purposes.
we
are
in
other
organizations.
we've
never
sought
the
right
to
stroll
about
the
campus
selling
--
selling
nurturer
or
hawking
or
soliciting
dues,
never
sought
the
right
to
solicit
them
within
dormitories
or
within
the
physical
facilities
of
the
campus.
it's
not
a
very
limited
and
as
i
understand
that
the
nature
of
the
court's
order
below,
that's
the
nature
that
we're
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
(voice
overlap)
booth
is
a
misnomer
action
but
no
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
--
it's
not
--
had
--
had
much
money.
obviously
they
have
card
tables
and
they
set
them
up
and
they
sit
behind
the
card
table.
mr.
david
r.
richards
sure.
that's
what
they
do
now.
mr.
david
r.
richards
well
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
i
guess
i
shouldn't
hold
myself.
i
have
to
be
a
expert
on
what
really
have
to
transpires
,
i
--
we
described
and
really
narrowly
in
the
terms
i'm
now
indicating
to
you,
that
is
we
wanted
to
be
able
to
do
the
same
kind
of
activities
that
other
organizations
were
doing
in
those
same
areas.
and
we
didn't
want
to
have
our
activities
limited
by
simply
the
label
that
--
that
it's
commercial.
and
so
we
really
sought
parity,
that's
all,
with
respect
to
the
kinds
of
activities
that
other
student
organizations
are
doing
under
the
guise
of
being
--
for
which
they
have
approval.
now,
the
record
reflects
the
young
people
selling
balloons
from
a
booth
on
the
campus.
we
would
assume
that
our
conduct
in
a
similar
location
would
be
no
more
disruptive
in
the
sale
of
balloons
that
we
ought
to
be
able
--
permitted
to
do
so.
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
actually
the
record
reflects
and
this
is
in
a
narrow
period
of
time
and
this
is
the
rule
that
permission
is
sought
for
a
specific
time
or
times,
sometime
the
stipulative
responses
to
the
interrogatories
i
think
will
reflect
in
the
record
the
kind
of
permission
that
sought.
some
people
seek
--
my
clients
have
for
a
week
to
maintain
a
booth
on
the
mall
for
such
and
such
purpose
and
have
done
so.
they
still
seek
permission
and
we
haven't
even
quarreled
with
that
to
this
extent.
we've
conceded
that
there
are
legitimate
concerns
for
congestion
that
the
university
may
well
say
we
cant
tolerate
more
than
15
or
20
booths
on
this
area,
it's
going
to
be
first
--
first
come
first
serve
and
that
there's
going
to
be
a
limit
in
terms
of
time.
we've
--
we've
conceded
that
in
the
court
below
and
i
think
the
court
below
conceded
that
in
its
opinion.
but
the
stipulation
is
that
they
are
frequently
as
many
as
15
booths
erected
along
the
west
mall
as
it's
called
in
the
university
campus
soliciting
--
disturbing
literature,
and
matters
of
this
kind.
it
simply
sought
to
--
as
i
say,
it
simply
sought
parity
here.
and
i
think
that's
all
the
court
below
did.i
think
your
opinion
fairly
gives
the
regents
and
the
responsible
university
administrators
full
authority
to
maintain
their
institution,
and
mr.
--
mr.
shultz
has
argued
the
contrary.
yes.
mr.
david
r.
richards
not
in
my
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
i
am
not
representing
new
left
at
this
juncture.
mr.
david
r.
richards
well
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
i
--
i
guess
were
caught
up
in
a
sort
of
the
--
i
didn't
print
the
brief,
but
i
had
print
the
style
of
the
record.
the
record
still
carries
them
and
i
assume
that's
a
matter
of
nomenclature
in
some
of
this
clerk's
office.
the
case
was
never
restyled
below
when
the
new
left
was
dismissed
but
that
was
simply
a
matter
of
--
as
a
manner
of
--
it's
a
matter
of
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
--
policy
and
personnel
--
excuse
me
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
sure.
that's
quite
alright.
mr.
david
r.
richards
had
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
yes.
it
has
been
granted
and
granted
--
commonly
granted.
mr.
david
r.
richards
in
the
record's
own
question.
mr.
david
r.
richards
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
r.
richards
sale
also
of
political
literature,
let
me
add
that.
that
that
the
young
democrats
had
buffer
stickers,
at
one
occasion,
they
wanted
to
sell
from
that
same
booth.
mr.
david
r.
richards
political
buffer
stickers.
the
young
socialist
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
that
right.
we
could
give
them
away.
in
fact,
they
did
give
them
away
when
they
were
found
that
they
could
not
sell
them
but
of
course
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
--
financing
a
political
parties
being
such
it
is,
they
need
to
exactly
say,
pprice
that
they
can.
mr.
david
r.
richards
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
r.
richards
that's
all
as
i
understand
it.
let
me
say
that
it's
--
if
the
regulation
is
counts
in
the
guise
of
a
prohibition
against
commercial
solicitation
and
the
regents
by
their
application
of
it
have
swept
up
this
kind
of
a
political
activity
in
the
embargo
against
commercial
solicitation.
mr.
david
r.
richards
it
had
commercial
aspect
(voice
overlap)
mr.
david
r.
richards
that
would
--
that's
our
contention.
yes,
your
honor.
the
appendix
at
137
through
141
have
some
indication
of
the
kinds
of
literature
in
the
organizations
that
are
engaged
in
distribution
of
literature
in
this
very,
very
areas
all
throughout
the
--
the
year.
let
me,
and
as
much
as
we
have
throughout
maintained
that
this
matter
was
not
one
to
require
the
convening
of
a
three-judge
court
and
we
realized
of
course,
it
is
not
our
position,
perhaps
carry
that
burden.
it's
been
our
view
from
the
--
in
the
outset,
we
opposed
the
convening
of
the
three-judge
court
and
we
still
assume
that
this
matter
could
have
been
disposed
off
amply
by
a
single
judge
sitting
in
travis
county.
we
do
not
consider
that
the
regulations
have
the
general
and
statewide
application
that
this
court
spoke
of
in
moody
versus
flowers
and
hence,
and
as
our
brief
points
out
and
i
think
the
texas
statutes
to
which
we
refer
will
demonstrate
there
are
some
40
or
50
or
60
various
institutions
of
higher
learning
in
texas.
and
as
mr.
shultz
concedes,
these
rules
we
talked
about
applied
to
only
a
portion
of
those,
i'll
be
clear
the
university
of
texas
is
the
most
substantial.
mr.
david
r.
richards
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
as
i
say,
we
refer
to
art.
2919e
of
the
texas
civil
statutes,
list
of
what
i
consider
to
be,
or
at
least
to
that
point,
all
the
statewide
--
state
supported
institutions
of
higher
education
of
junior
college
and
senior
college.
and
i
think,
in
reference
to
that,
i
think
it
put
in
perspective
the
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
i
--
i
think
i
said
40
out
in
my
brief,
i
haven't
the
chance
to
count
them
but
it
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
oh,
i
think
that's
right.
some
of
which
have
yet
to
be
opened
but
nevertheless,
they
will
be
opened
soon.
mr.
david
r.
richards
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
r.
richards
that's
right.
mr.
david
r.
richards
on
campus?
mr.
david
r.
richards
no,
your
honor.
that
--
that
has
not
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
--
been
permitted
in
the
past.
mr.
david
r.
richards
give
them
away.
mr.
david
r.
richards
there
has
been
no
restriction
on
giving
them
away
except
--
but
they
--
they
have
not
been
permitted
to
be
sold.
that
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
their
universities
sanction
publications
are
sold.
along
there
is
a
stipulation
the
record
reflects.
this
are
(voice

--
mr.
david
r.
richards
school
--
well,
school
papers
or
magazines.
the
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
--
the
student
association
is
authorized
to
sell
insurance
to
the
students
which
of
course,
again,
its
university
related
but
it
certainly
has
a
very
substantial
commercial
aspect.
there
are
regular
activities
on
the
campus
of
the
kind
of
motion
pictures
where
the
public
can
come
to
and
pay
to
see
entertainments
of
various
sorts.
the
campus
is
a
--
as
mr.
shultz
indicates
is
a
rather
substantial
size
and
number.
it's
now
houses
the
lyndon
johnson
library
which
has
become
one
of
the
major
tourist
attractions
in
our
part
of
the
world.
and
it's
a
place
that
embraces
all
manner
of
activities
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
--
of
variant
commercial
aspects,
both
directly
related
to
the
university
and
the
spinoff
center
(inaudible)
mr.
david
r.
richards
it
declares
them
invalid.
the
--
the
text
in
the
opinion
makes
clear
as
i
understand
it
that
the
--
well,
i
--
it
does
declare
them
invalid,
yes,
and
enjoins
our
enforcement
as
to
these
two
plaintiffs,
the
young
democrats
and
the
young
socialists.
mr.
david
r.
richards
they
--
unless
they
have
supplanted
them,
they
are
without
regulations
of
this.
mr.
david
r.
richards
i
think
it
was
not
essential
to
give
relief,
i
ask
(inaudible)
the
judgment
runs
only
as
to
the
plaintiffs
who
are
the
young
democrats
and
the
young
socialists.
mr.
david
r.
richards
--
it
does
not
run
the
world
at
large
and
the
--
and
the
injunction
does
--
i
--
i
--
if
you
--
the
judgment
appears
at
176-172.
mr.
david
r.
richards
and
in
paragraph
two,
and
then
perhaps
declares
the
activities
engaged
in
by
the
plaintiffs
and
this
is
by
reference,
the
young
democrats,
the
young
socialists.
mr.
david
r.
richards
the
solicitation
member
to
see
if
--
and
sale
of
literature
constitutes
speech
and
associational
activities.
mr.
david
r.
richards
i
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
i
suppose
as
a
matter
of
construction,
trial
court's
judgment
and
there
maybe
a
certain
inconsistency
there
at
least.
i
confess
i
had
thought
of
it
running
only
to
the
plaintiffs
and
running
the
kinds
of
activities
i've
indicated
but
your
quite
--
i
guess
it
could
be
construed
by
the
trial
court
anymore,
their
judgment
could
be
construed
more
broadly
by
this.
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
let
me
--
i'll
come
to
that
and
try
to
speak
to
it,
because
i
don't
want
to
be
caught
up
in
the
notion
that
we
all
were
here
together,
the
--
the
people
who
were
sent
back
to
the
state
court
in
the
young
democrats
and
young
socialists.
and
it
prefaced
my
remark
for
saying
that
--
that
i
don't
want
--
mr.
shultz
has
eluded
from
time
to
time
to
the
fact
that
everybody's
all
been
represent
by
same
counsel.
but
the
explanation
to
that
i
think
is
sufficient
to
say
that,
that's
true
of
most
civil
liberties
cases
in
that
part
of
texas.
i
don't
think
you
can
make
judgments
about
or
that
--
that
makes
weight
in
terms
of
who's
here.
that
the
rag
plaintiffs
as
they
recalled
were
severed
and
sent
back
to
the
state
court
and
remained
there.
they
never
sought
to
return
to
the
state
--
to
the
federal
court.
the
seek
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
they
initiated
the
lawsuit.
until
they
were
dismissed
from
it,
it
was
their
lawsuit.
mr.
david
r.
richards
but
then
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
let's
--
i
take
it
that
the
court's
order
that
appears
is
exquisite
that
they
consider
them
dismissed
and
they
could
go
back.
they
were
--
the
state
court
was
in
fact
totally
was
free
to
proceed
against
them.
the
reservation
that
--
that
mr.
shultz
refers
to,
i
--
i'm
not
certain.
i
assume
if
that's
the
kind
of
reservation
that
was
contemplated
perhaps
that
--
for
the
notion
that
they
didn't
raise
the
federal
constitutional
issues
in
the
state
courts
that
they
might
later
come
back,
i
think
it
could
be
construed
in
that
fashion.
but
the
sequence
of
events,
i
think,
is
material
here.
mr.
shultz's
compressed,
i
think,
the
time
factor.
the
suit
was
filed,
that's
correct,
by
the,
what
was
called
the
new
left
education
project
in
the
federal
court.
thereafter,
as
the
record
reflects,
the
regents
changed
their
rules
again
and
caught
up
the
young
democrats
and
the
rules
and
said
the
first
time
that
they
couldn't
--
not
solicit
membership
dues
at
registration
time
which
had
been
a
traditional
right
of
theirs.
at
that
point,
the
young
democrats
filed
--
we
filed.
they
came
--
we
filed
a
notion
to
amend
to
join
them.
the
regents
opposed
urging
among
other
things
that
there
should
be
severance.
this
was
all
argued
at
one
time.
the
court
issued
its
order
supporting
the
regents
with
respective
to
a
three-judge
court,
severing
out
the
initial
plaintiffs,
the
new
left
plaintiffs
and
sending
them
back
to
the
state
court
and
saying
if
they
would
--
can
take
and
keep,
retain
the
action
as
to
the
young
democrats
for
further
proceedings.
three
months
later,
the
young
socialists
filed
a
motion
to
intervene
and
were
permitted
intervention.
if
i
--
i
mean
it
was
in
that
posture
of
the
case
came
on
for
a
final
decision.
the
arguments
with
respect
to
class,
with
respect
to
res
judicata,
i
--
are
--
are
murky
but
i
--
at
best,
i
--
the
texas
class
action
rule
is
the
old
federal
rule
that
is
they
had
dispute.
it
was
in
a
high
(inaudible)
from
the
federal
rules,
no
notion
of
this
furious
class,
and
it
was
not
binding
as
a
matter
of
res
judicata
unlike
the
new
federal
rule.
the
--
although
the
grant
of
a
temporary
injunction
is
appealable,
it's
only
reversal
on
a
clear
abuse
of
discretion
that's
governing
texas
standards
so
i
don't
think
there's
finality
in
the
texas
state
court
judgment
that
would
sustain
res
judicata.
and
finally,
these
parties
albeit
having
similar
interest
whenever
in
the
state
court.
they
were
told
in
fact
by
the
federal
courts
that
they
were
free
to
remain
there
and
litigate
their
issues,
and
this,
they
did.
and
i
see
--
i
think,
but
for
the
birth
of
the
case
and
perhaps
that's
--
i
--
i
take
full
responsibility
for
that.
i
guess
they're
just
a
matter
of
judicial
economy
or
economy
in
the
office
or
something.
we
didn't
file
a
separate
suit
on
behalf
of
the
young
democrats.
the
case
was
already
--
at
that
stage
going
to
be
considered
by
three
judges
on
several
issues.
and
so,
rather
than
do
another
one
and
have
another
three-judge
court
appointed,
we
did
it
this
way.
but
i
think
all
that
really
says
is
we
had
at
one
point,
two
parties
had
sort
of
crossed
in
the
night
in
this
litigation
and
really
had
nothing
to
do
with
each
other
since
then.
mr.
david
r.
richards
i
--
the
federal
court
has
said
--
excuse
me
--
i
don't
--
i
didn't
mean
not
to
respond
to
it,
your
honor.
the
federal
court
has
said
that
he
was
free
to
proceed
against
them
and
i
assume
that
he
has
been
free
to
do
so.
their
contentions
had
been
made
with
respect
to
their
activities
are
entirely
different
frankly
from
that
of
the
young
democrats
and
the
young
socialists.
contentions
being
made
of
harassment
of
verbal
abuse,
this
kind
of
thing,
but
all
of
which
might
have
sustained
injunctive
relief
as
to
that
kind
of
conduct.
but
none
of
that
was
present
with
respect
to
my
clients
who
were
here
before
this
court,
the
young
democrats
and
young
socialists.
no
suggestion
that
they've
engaged
in
anything
more
than
just
a
simple
organization
of
first
amendment
conduct.
mr.
david
r.
richards
i
think
it
would
certainly.
mr.
david
r.
richards
that's
what
i'm
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
--
thinking.
mr.
david
r.
richards
they
were
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
right.
mr.
david
r.
richards
don't
have
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
that's
--
i
don't
want
to
say
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
that's
--
well,
that
--
that's
the
way
i
have
always
viewed
it
except
it's
been
caught
up
as
i
say
in
sort
of
giving
numbers
and
names
to
it
to
make
it
appear
one
which
clearly
a
different
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
i
think
--
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
and
i
didn't
--
i
--
i
was
going
to
come
back
but
i
don't
want
to
be
unfair.
actually,
the
young
socialist
do
have
a
paper,
they
like
to
sell
called
“the
militant”.
so
i
--
i
don't
mean
to
say
that
embraced
within
their
activities
was
not
the
sale
of
a
political
newspaper
and
that
mr.
shultz
is
quite
right
about
that.
the
--
i
think
the
first
--
i've
tried
to
state
the
first
amendment
issues,
i
think,
in
opening
argument.
i
would
add
only
this
that
we're
now
dealing
with
the
twenty-sixth
amendment's
enactment
for
the
student
body
to
all
exchange
voters.
as
i
looked
at
the
figures,
only
1%
now
of
the
student
body
is
under
the
age
of
18
years
of
age
and
we're
not
dealing
with
--
we're
dealing
with
the
citizens
whom
we've
now
accorded
the
full
right
to
vote.
we're
dealing
with
them
in
the
area
in
which
their
interests
are
normally
debated.
it
would
be
--
seem
to
me
consistent
with
that
first
amendment
with
their
freedom
of
their
voting
right
that
at
least
political
issues
and
the
activities
of
traditional
political
organizations
be
permitted
to
flourish
in
a
non-disruptive
matter
on
the
university
campus
in
the
one
place
that
these
--
the
young
people
can
be
reached.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
mr.
david
r.
richards
yes.
mr.
chief
justice
and
--
excuse
me,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
a
series
of
initial
procedural
and
jurisdictional
questions.
if
they
are
ever
answered
suitably,
then
the
--
the
case
then
presents
a
rather
clear
first
amendment
question
regarding
the
extent
to
which
a
state
university
may
restrict
the
legitimate
first
amendment
activities
of
student
political
organizations
on
campus.
mr.
david
r.
richards
i
agree
that
the
balance
may
be
struck
and
that
clearly,
that
the
rights
are
not
absolute
and
that
the
right
to
maintain
the
institution
and
to
operate
it
still
be
or
at
least
may
be
paramount
if
not
certainly,
it
must
be
given
this
way.
we
say
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
specifically,
we're
concerned
here,
as
--
as
we
understood,
the
first
amendment
issue.
we
have
two
organizations
that
are
here
before
the
court,
the
young
democrats
and
the
young
socialist,
registered
student
organizations,
long
time
participants
on
the
campus.
they
have
sought
the
right
to
solicit
membership
dues
in
the
same
areas
of
the
campus
to
with
the
malls
in
which
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
memberships
and
membership
dues,
excuse
me.
memberships
and
membership
dues
because
i
--
i
say
this
advisably
because
the
nature
of
the
regulation
is
such
that
they
are
now
permitted
under
the
regulation
to
establish
a
booth.
they
may
maintain
a
booth
on
the
mall,
they
distribute
literature,
but
they
say
the
organization
may
not,
at
the
same
time
say
to
that
person,
“join
our
organization,
here's
a
membership
card,
pay
us
two
bucks.”
they
say
that's
commercial
--
falls
avowal
of
the
commercial
regulations.
so,
really,
all
they're
saying
is
that
we
want
to
carry
out
the
full
range
of
our
activities
which
are
legitimate,
that
is
solicit
membership
dues
in
the
same
locations
where
we're
permitted
to
carry
out
other
kinds.
they
can
set
up
a
booth,
set
up
--
circulate
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
--
competition
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
this
has
been
the
position
from
the
outset
as
i
understood.
the
--
what
we've
argued
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
essentially,
we
were
looking
--
well,
i
mean
i
shouldn't
and
we
--
we
also
argued
for
the
right
to
sell
political
literature
from
that
same
booth
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
not
--
we've
never
asked
the
right
to
roam
the
campus
and
never
suggested
that
that
was
necessary,
the
malls
are
wide
and
open,
there's
movement
there
all
the
time.
there
are
other
activities
of
a
comparable
nature
and
all
we
wanted
to
--
to
do
was
to
flesh
out
our
entire
activities
by
at
least
soliciting
dues.
it's
the
only
logical
place
to
do
so
frankly.
it's
the
only
place
we
see
the
--
see
the
students
to
whom
we
appeal.
mr.
david
r.
richards
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
r.
richards
it
has
never
--
our
contention
has
been
the
former.
that
is
that
we
sought
to
do,
perform
these
activities
in
the
same
areas
from
the
same
type
of
booth
we
are
now
functioning
from
for
other
purposes.
we
are
in
other
organizations.
we've
never
sought
the
right
to
stroll
about
the
campus
selling
--
selling
nurturer
or
hawking
or
soliciting
dues,
never
sought
the
right
to
solicit
them
within
dormitories
or
within
the
physical
facilities
of
the
campus.
it's
not
a
very
limited
and
as
i
understand
that
the
nature
of
the
court's
order
below,
that's
the
nature
that
we're
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
(voice
overlap)
booth
is
a
misnomer
action
but
no
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
--
it's
not
--
had
--
had
much
money.
obviously
they
have
card
tables
and
they
set
them
up
and
they
sit
behind
the
card
table.
mr.
david
r.
richards
sure.
that's
what
they
do
now.
mr.
david
r.
richards
well
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
i
guess
i
shouldn't
hold
myself.
i
have
to
be
a
expert
on
what
really
have
to
transpires
,
i
--
we
described
and
really
narrowly
in
the
terms
i'm
now
indicating
to
you,
that
is
we
wanted
to
be
able
to
do
the
same
kind
of
activities
that
other
organizations
were
doing
in
those
same
areas.
and
we
didn't
want
to
have
our
activities
limited
by
simply
the
label
that
--
that
it's
commercial.
and
so
we
really
sought
parity,
that's
all,
with
respect
to
the
kinds
of
activities
that
other
student
organizations
are
doing
under
the
guise
of
being
--
for
which
they
have
approval.
now,
the
record
reflects
the
young
people
selling
balloons
from
a
booth
on
the
campus.
we
would
assume
that
our
conduct
in
a
similar
location
would
be
no
more
disruptive
in
the
sale
of
balloons
that
we
ought
to
be
able
--
permitted
to
do
so.
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
actually
the
record
reflects
and
this
is
in
a
narrow
period
of
time
and
this
is
the
rule
that
permission
is
sought
for
a
specific
time
or
times,
sometime
the
stipulative
responses
to
the
interrogatories
i
think
will
reflect
in
the
record
the
kind
of
permission
that
sought.
some
people
seek
--
my
clients
have
for
a
week
to
maintain
a
booth
on
the
mall
for
such
and
such
purpose
and
have
done
so.
they
still
seek
permission
and
we
haven't
even
quarreled
with
that
to
this
extent.
we've
conceded
that
there
are
legitimate
concerns
for
congestion
that
the
university
may
well
say
we
cant
tolerate
more
than
15
or
20
booths
on
this
area,
it's
going
to
be
first
--
first
come
first
serve
and
that
there's
going
to
be
a
limit
in
terms
of
time.
we've
--
we've
conceded
that
in
the
court
below
and
i
think
the
court
below
conceded
that
in
its
opinion.
but
the
stipulation
is
that
they
are
frequently
as
many
as
15
booths
erected
along
the
west
mall
as
it's
called
in
the
university
campus
soliciting
--
disturbing
literature,
and
matters
of
this
kind.
it
simply
sought
to
--
as
i
say,
it
simply
sought
parity
here.
and
i
think
that's
all
the
court
below
did.i
think
your
opinion
fairly
gives
the
regents
and
the
responsible
university
administrators
full
authority
to
maintain
their
institution,
and
mr.
--
mr.
shultz
has
argued
the
contrary.
yes.
mr.
david
r.
richards
not
in
my
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
i
am
not
representing
new
left
at
this
juncture.
mr.
david
r.
richards
well
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
i
--
i
guess
were
caught
up
in
a
sort
of
the
--
i
didn't
print
the
brief,
but
i
had
print
the
style
of
the
record.
the
record
still
carries
them
and
i
assume
that's
a
matter
of
nomenclature
in
some
of
this
clerk's
office.
the
case
was
never
restyled
below
when
the
new
left
was
dismissed
but
that
was
simply
a
matter
of
--
as
a
manner
of
--
it's
a
matter
of
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
--
policy
and
personnel
--
excuse
me
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
sure.
that's
quite
alright.
mr.
david
r.
richards
had
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
yes.
it
has
been
granted
and
granted
--
commonly
granted.
mr.
david
r.
richards
in
the
record's
own
question.
mr.
david
r.
richards
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
r.
richards
sale
also
of
political
literature,
let
me
add
that.
that
that
the
young
democrats
had
buffer
stickers,
at
one
occasion,
they
wanted
to
sell
from
that
same
booth.
mr.
david
r.
richards
political
buffer
stickers.
the
young
socialist
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
that
right.
we
could
give
them
away.
in
fact,
they
did
give
them
away
when
they
were
found
that
they
could
not
sell
them
but
of
course
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
--
financing
a
political
parties
being
such
it
is,
they
need
to
exactly
say,
pprice
that
they
can.
mr.
david
r.
richards
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
r.
richards
that's
all
as
i
understand
it.
let
me
say
that
it's
--
if
the
regulation
is
counts
in
the
guise
of
a
prohibition
against
commercial
solicitation
and
the
regents
by
their
application
of
it
have
swept
up
this
kind
of
a
political
activity
in
the
embargo
against
commercial
solicitation.
mr.
david
r.
richards
it
had
commercial
aspect
(voice
overlap)
mr.
david
r.
richards
that
would
--
that's
our
contention.
yes,
your
honor.
the
appendix
at
137
through
141
have
some
indication
of
the
kinds
of
literature
in
the
organizations
that
are
engaged
in
distribution
of
literature
in
this
very,
very
areas
all
throughout
the
--
the
year.
let
me,
and
as
much
as
we
have
throughout
maintained
that
this
matter
was
not
one
to
require
the
convening
of
a
three-judge
court
and
we
realized
of
course,
it
is
not
our
position,
perhaps
carry
that
burden.
it's
been
our
view
from
the
--
in
the
outset,
we
opposed
the
convening
of
the
three-judge
court
and
we
still
assume
that
this
matter
could
have
been
disposed
off
amply
by
a
single
judge
sitting
in
travis
county.
we
do
not
consider
that
the
regulations
have
the
general
and
statewide
application
that
this
court
spoke
of
in
moody
versus
flowers
and
hence,
and
as
our
brief
points
out
and
i
think
the
texas
statutes
to
which
we
refer
will
demonstrate
there
are
some
40
or
50
or
60
various
institutions
of
higher
learning
in
texas.
and
as
mr.
shultz
concedes,
these
rules
we
talked
about
applied
to
only
a
portion
of
those,
i'll
be
clear
the
university
of
texas
is
the
most
substantial.
mr.
david
r.
richards
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
as
i
say,
we
refer
to
art.
2919e
of
the
texas
civil
statutes,
list
of
what
i
consider
to
be,
or
at
least
to
that
point,
all
the
statewide
--
state
supported
institutions
of
higher
education
of
junior
college
and
senior
college.
and
i
think,
in
reference
to
that,
i
think
it
put
in
perspective
the
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
i
--
i
think
i
said
40
out
in
my
brief,
i
haven't
the
chance
to
count
them
but
it
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
oh,
i
think
that's
right.
some
of
which
have
yet
to
be
opened
but
nevertheless,
they
will
be
opened
soon.
mr.
david
r.
richards
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
r.
richards
that's
right.
mr.
david
r.
richards
on
campus?
mr.
david
r.
richards
no,
your
honor.
that
--
that
has
not
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
--
been
permitted
in
the
past.
mr.
david
r.
richards
give
them
away.
mr.
david
r.
richards
there
has
been
no
restriction
on
giving
them
away
except
--
but
they
--
they
have
not
been
permitted
to
be
sold.
that
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
their
universities
sanction
publications
are
sold.
along
there
is
a
stipulation
the
record
reflects.
this
are
(voice

--
mr.
david
r.
richards
school
--
well,
school
papers
or
magazines.
the
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
--
the
student
association
is
authorized
to
sell
insurance
to
the
students
which
of
course,
again,
its
university
related
but
it
certainly
has
a
very
substantial
commercial
aspect.
there
are
regular
activities
on
the
campus
of
the
kind
of
motion
pictures
where
the
public
can
come
to
and
pay
to
see
entertainments
of
various
sorts.
the
campus
is
a
--
as
mr.
shultz
indicates
is
a
rather
substantial
size
and
number.
it's
now
houses
the
lyndon
johnson
library
which
has
become
one
of
the
major
tourist
attractions
in
our
part
of
the
world.
and
it's
a
place
that
embraces
all
manner
of
activities
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
--
of
variant
commercial
aspects,
both
directly
related
to
the
university
and
the
spinoff
center
(inaudible)
mr.
david
r.
richards
it
declares
them
invalid.
the
--
the
text
in
the
opinion
makes
clear
as
i
understand
it
that
the
--
well,
i
--
it
does
declare
them
invalid,
yes,
and
enjoins
our
enforcement
as
to
these
two
plaintiffs,
the
young
democrats
and
the
young
socialists.
mr.
david
r.
richards
they
--
unless
they
have
supplanted
them,
they
are
without
regulations
of
this.
mr.
david
r.
richards
i
think
it
was
not
essential
to
give
relief,
i
ask
(inaudible)
the
judgment
runs
only
as
to
the
plaintiffs
who
are
the
young
democrats
and
the
young
socialists.
mr.
david
r.
richards
--
it
does
not
run
the
world
at
large
and
the
--
and
the
injunction
does
--
i
--
i
--
if
you
--
the
judgment
appears
at
176-172.
mr.
david
r.
richards
and
in
paragraph
two,
and
then
perhaps
declares
the
activities
engaged
in
by
the
plaintiffs
and
this
is
by
reference,
the
young
democrats,
the
young
socialists.
mr.
david
r.
richards
the
solicitation
member
to
see
if
--
and
sale
of
literature
constitutes
speech
and
associational
activities.
mr.
david
r.
richards
i
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
i
suppose
as
a
matter
of
construction,
trial
court's
judgment
and
there
maybe
a
certain
inconsistency
there
at
least.
i
confess
i
had
thought
of
it
running
only
to
the
plaintiffs
and
running
the
kinds
of
activities
i've
indicated
but
your
quite
--
i
guess
it
could
be
construed
by
the
trial
court
anymore,
their
judgment
could
be
construed
more
broadly
by
this.
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
let
me
--
i'll
come
to
that
and
try
to
speak
to
it,
because
i
don't
want
to
be
caught
up
in
the
notion
that
we
all
were
here
together,
the
--
the
people
who
were
sent
back
to
the
state
court
in
the
young
democrats
and
young
socialists.
and
it
prefaced
my
remark
for
saying
that
--
that
i
don't
want
--
mr.
shultz
has
eluded
from
time
to
time
to
the
fact
that
everybody's
all
been
represent
by
same
counsel.
but
the
explanation
to
that
i
think
is
sufficient
to
say
that,
that's
true
of
most
civil
liberties
cases
in
that
part
of
texas.
i
don't
think
you
can
make
judgments
about
or
that
--
that
makes
weight
in
terms
of
who's
here.
that
the
rag
plaintiffs
as
they
recalled
were
severed
and
sent
back
to
the
state
court
and
remained
there.
they
never
sought
to
return
to
the
state
--
to
the
federal
court.
the
seek
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
they
initiated
the
lawsuit.
until
they
were
dismissed
from
it,
it
was
their
lawsuit.
mr.
david
r.
richards
but
then
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
let's
--
i
take
it
that
the
court's
order
that
appears
is
exquisite
that
they
consider
them
dismissed
and
they
could
go
back.
they
were
--
the
state
court
was
in
fact
totally
was
free
to
proceed
against
them.
the
reservation
that
--
that
mr.
shultz
refers
to,
i
--
i'm
not
certain.
i
assume
if
that's
the
kind
of
reservation
that
was
contemplated
perhaps
that
--
for
the
notion
that
they
didn't
raise
the
federal
constitutional
issues
in
the
state
courts
that
they
might
later
come
back,
i
think
it
could
be
construed
in
that
fashion.
but
the
sequence
of
events,
i
think,
is
material
here.
mr.
shultz's
compressed,
i
think,
the
time
factor.
the
suit
was
filed,
that's
correct,
by
the,
what
was
called
the
new
left
education
project
in
the
federal
court.
thereafter,
as
the
record
reflects,
the
regents
changed
their
rules
again
and
caught
up
the
young
democrats
and
the
rules
and
said
the
first
time
that
they
couldn't
--
not
solicit
membership
dues
at
registration
time
which
had
been
a
traditional
right
of
theirs.
at
that
point,
the
young
democrats
filed
--
we
filed.
they
came
--
we
filed
a
notion
to
amend
to
join
them.
the
regents
opposed
urging
among
other
things
that
there
should
be
severance.
this
was
all
argued
at
one
time.
the
court
issued
its
order
supporting
the
regents
with
respective
to
a
three-judge
court,
severing
out
the
initial
plaintiffs,
the
new
left
plaintiffs
and
sending
them
back
to
the
state
court
and
saying
if
they
would
--
can
take
and
keep,
retain
the
action
as
to
the
young
democrats
for
further
proceedings.
three
months
later,
the
young
socialists
filed
a
motion
to
intervene
and
were
permitted
intervention.
if
i
--
i
mean
it
was
in
that
posture
of
the
case
came
on
for
a
final
decision.
the
arguments
with
respect
to
class,
with
respect
to
res
judicata,
i
--
are
--
are
murky
but
i
--
at
best,
i
--
the
texas
class
action
rule
is
the
old
federal
rule
that
is
they
had
dispute.
it
was
in
a
high
(inaudible)
from
the
federal
rules,
no
notion
of
this
furious
class,
and
it
was
not
binding
as
a
matter
of
res
judicata
unlike
the
new
federal
rule.
the
--
although
the
grant
of
a
temporary
injunction
is
appealable,
it's
only
reversal
on
a
clear
abuse
of
discretion
that's
governing
texas
standards
so
i
don't
think
there's
finality
in
the
texas
state
court
judgment
that
would
sustain
res
judicata.
and
finally,
these
parties
albeit
having
similar
interest
whenever
in
the
state
court.
they
were
told
in
fact
by
the
federal
courts
that
they
were
free
to
remain
there
and
litigate
their
issues,
and
this,
they
did.
and
i
see
--
i
think,
but
for
the
birth
of
the
case
and
perhaps
that's
--
i
--
i
take
full
responsibility
for
that.
i
guess
they're
just
a
matter
of
judicial
economy
or
economy
in
the
office
or
something.
we
didn't
file
a
separate
suit
on
behalf
of
the
young
democrats.
the
case
was
already
--
at
that
stage
going
to
be
considered
by
three
judges
on
several
issues.
and
so,
rather
than
do
another
one
and
have
another
three-judge
court
appointed,
we
did
it
this
way.
but
i
think
all
that
really
says
is
we
had
at
one
point,
two
parties
had
sort
of
crossed
in
the
night
in
this
litigation
and
really
had
nothing
to
do
with
each
other
since
then.
mr.
david
r.
richards
i
--
the
federal
court
has
said
--
excuse
me
--
i
don't
--
i
didn't
mean
not
to
respond
to
it,
your
honor.
the
federal
court
has
said
that
he
was
free
to
proceed
against
them
and
i
assume
that
he
has
been
free
to
do
so.
their
contentions
had
been
made
with
respect
to
their
activities
are
entirely
different
frankly
from
that
of
the
young
democrats
and
the
young
socialists.
contentions
being
made
of
harassment
of
verbal
abuse,
this
kind
of
thing,
but
all
of
which
might
have
sustained
injunctive
relief
as
to
that
kind
of
conduct.
but
none
of
that
was
present
with
respect
to
my
clients
who
were
here
before
this
court,
the
young
democrats
and
young
socialists.
no
suggestion
that
they've
engaged
in
anything
more
than
just
a
simple
organization
of
first
amendment
conduct.
mr.
david
r.
richards
i
think
it
would
certainly.
mr.
david
r.
richards
that's
what
i'm
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
--
thinking.
mr.
david
r.
richards
they
were
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
right.
mr.
david
r.
richards
don't
have
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
that's
--
i
don't
want
to
say
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
that's
--
well,
that
--
that's
the
way
i
have
always
viewed
it
except
it's
been
caught
up
as
i
say
in
sort
of
giving
numbers
and
names
to
it
to
make
it
appear
one
which
clearly
a
different
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
i
think
--
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
and
i
didn't
--
i
--
i
was
going
to
come
back
but
i
don't
want
to
be
unfair.
actually,
the
young
socialist
do
have
a
paper,
they
like
to
sell
called
“the
militant”.
so
i
--
i
don't
mean
to
say
that
embraced
within
their
activities
was
not
the
sale
of
a
political
newspaper
and
that
mr.
shultz
is
quite
right
about
that.
the
--
i
think
the
first
--
i've
tried
to
state
the
first
amendment
issues,
i
think,
in
opening
argument.
i
would
add
only
this
that
we're
now
dealing
with
the
twenty-sixth
amendment's
enactment
for
the
student
body
to
all
exchange
voters.
as
i
looked
at
the
figures,
only
1%
now
of
the
student
body
is
under
the
age
of
18
years
of
age
and
we're
not
dealing
with
--
we're
dealing
with
the
citizens
whom
we've
now
accorded
the
full
right
to
vote.
we're
dealing
with
them
in
the
area
in
which
their
interests
are
normally
debated.
it
would
be
--
seem
to
me
consistent
with
that
first
amendment
with
their
freedom
of
their
voting
right
that
at
least
political
issues
and
the
activities
of
traditional
political
organizations
be
permitted
to
flourish
in
a
non-disruptive
matter
on
the
university
campus
in
the
one
place
that
these
--
the
young
people
can
be
reached.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
