mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
w.
o.
shultz,
an
assistant
attorney
general
from
the
state
of
texas.
i'm
representing
the
board
of
regents
in
this
case
this
morning.
initially
since
this
court
postponed
jurisdiction
until
argument
i
address
myself
briefly
to
this
jurisdictional
question.
the
only
objection
which
appellee
raises
in
his
brief
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
is
--
concerned
itself
with
the
fact
that
there
is
a
coordinating
board
in
the
state
of
texas
and
the
appellant
contends
that
is
a
higher
authority
that
has
statewide
jurisdiction
and
the
board
of
regents
is
somehow
under
yet
with
regard
to
its
rules
and
regulations.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
this
is
not
so.
the
act
creating
the
coordinating
board
and
makes
it
precisely
that,
a
coordinating
board.
its
primary
purposes
are
to
coordinate
the
degree
programs
through
the
institutions
in
the
state
of
texas.
our
higher
education
set
up
several
of
the
colleges,
have
their
own
board
of
regents.
the
university
of
texas
of
course
has
a
systemwide
campus
setup.
we
have
a
--
campuses
in
el
paso,
arlington,
dallas,
odessa,
midland,
houston,
galveston,
port
aransas,
san
antonio.
these
are
all
under
the
direction
of
the
board
of
regents.
and
the
primary
purpose
of
the
coordinating
board
is
to
coordinate
degree
programs
in
all
the
colleges.
and
then
before
a
college
can
institute
a
new
degree
program,
they
must
get
approval
to
the
coordinating
board.
the
act
creating
the
board
specifically
says
that
it
shall
have
only
such
powers
as
are
given
to
it
in
the
board,
i
mean
in
the
act
in
any
power
which
one
of
the
governing
boards
of
an
institution
of
higher
education
has
that
are
not
specifically
delegated
to
the
coordinating
board.
the
coordinating
board
does
not
have
and
there's
no
provision
in
the
coordinating
board
act
which
gives
them
the
authority
to
promulgate
rules
and
regulations
which
are
applicable
to
any
other
campuses
with
regard
to
the
day-to-day
operation
of
those
campuses.
at
the
last
session
of
the
legislature,
there
was
a
codification
of
--
of
the
various
education
acts,
they
were
put
into
an
education
code.
well,
this
coordinating
board
act
was
incorporated
in
the
education
code.
at
the
same
time,
same
session
of
the
legislature,
there
was
an
act
passed
applying
specifically
to
the
board
of
regents
of
the
university
of
texas
system,
it's
art.
2585e,
vernon's
civil
statute
and
just
recently
been
codified
as
such.
section
1
of
that
act
reaffirms
the
powers
of
the
board
of
regents
to
promulgate
rules
and
regulations
applicable
systemwide
and
may
--
may
i
quote
--
if
i
may
quote
briefly,
it
says
authority
--
the
board
has
authority
“to
promulgate
and
enforce
such
other
rules
and
regulations
for
the
operation,
control
and
management
of
the
university
of
texas
system,
and
the
component
institutions
thereof
as
the
board
of
regents
of
the
university
of
texas
system
may
deem
either
necessary
or
desirable.”
section
5
of
that
act
says,
and
i
quote,
“this
act
is
cumulative
of
all
statutes
relating
to
the
university
of
texas
system
or
any
of
the
component
institutions
of
the
university
of
texas
system,
except
where
--
where
such
statute
may
be
in
conflict
with
this
act.
if
any
such
conflict
arises,
the
conflicting
statute
is
hereof
by
repeal
to
the
extent
of
that
conflict.”
so
here,
we
have,
i
think
all
doubt
removed
as
to
any
primary
authority
in
the
coordinating
board
as
to
its
regulatory
power,
veto
power
of
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
board
of
regents.
now,
on
the
texas
law,
our
texas
supreme
court
has
held
that
the
regulations
and
rules
of
the
board
of
regents
of
university
of
texas
are
the
equivalent
of
statutory
enactments,
they
are
laws.
i
think
that
since
these
regulations
are
systemwide
and
cover
a
substantial
area
of
the
state.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
they
are
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
yes,
your
honor,
there
are.
they're
not
part
of
the
university
of
texas
system
however.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
they
apply
to
all
schools
and
institutions
within
the
university
of
texas
system,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
(voice
overlap)
oh,
i
think
they
--
they
say
they
--
they
have
17
component
institutions
in
the
system.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
that's
correct,
your
honor.
there's
--
university
of
texas
at
austin,
university
of
texas
at
el
paso,
university
of
texas
at
permian
basin,
university
of
texas
at
dallas,
university
of
texas
at
san
antonio,
and
there's
the
university
of
texas
med
school
in
galveston,
the
tumor
center
in
--
school
in
houston,
a
south
west
med
school
in
dallas,
nursing
school
in
houston,
the
institute
of
marine
sciences
in
port
aransas.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
they're
all
the
university
of
texas
system.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
some
of
them
have
their
own
individual
boards
of
regents.
we
have
north
texas
state
university,
it
has
its
own
board
of
regents
by
itself.
we
have
texas
woman's
university,
it
has
its
own
board
of
regents
by
itself,
they
have
one
campus
only.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
none
i
think
other
than
that
they
all
got
their
money
from
the
appropriation
from
the
texas
legislature.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
they
only
states
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
not
as
far
as
regulating
the
hiring
and
firing,
the
day-to-day
operation
in
the
school,
the
rules
and
regulations.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
pardon?
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
to
do
--
to
do
--
that
has
this
power?
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
the
coordinating
board
has
to
the
extent
it
has
power
to
--
to
try
to
coordinate
the
degree
programs.
it
--
it
was
primarily
established
to
--
we
--
we
had
rather
a
hodgepodge
in
our
higher
education
system
frankly
to
try
and
keep
duplication
of
degree
programs
and
efforts
at
the
various
schools
to
a
minimum
by
requiring
approval
for
institution
of
new
degree
programs
or
the
establishment
of
a
new
college
or
school
within
the
particular
university.
they
--
they
set
there
the
supreme
powers
and
well,
now
this
school
has
--
already
has
a
pretty
good
program
that
that
--
and
that
--
feel
now,
do
we
need
one
at
this
school?
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
that's
a
matter
of
dispute,
mr.
justice
marshall.our
constitution
said
that
texas
a&m
is
a
branch
of
the
university
of
texas
but
it
has
operated
under
its
own
board
of
regents
for
many,
many
years.
the
only
--
the
only
common
thing
they
share
is
that
texas
a&m
university
gets
a
part
of
the
permanent
endowment
fund
that
was
set
aside
to
the
university
of
texas
under
the
constitution
of
1876.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
it
is
as
far
as
its
operation
is
concerned,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
that's
true.
it's
not
a
part
of
the
university
of
texas
system.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
it
applies
to
every
institution
under
the
control
of
the
board
of
regents
of
the
university
of
texas
system.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
no,
your
honor.
we've
never
made
that
contention.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
i
--
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
once
--
once
the
rule
or
regulation
itself,
it's
applicable
to
all
the
institutions
under
this
board's
control
and
those
boards
are
statewide.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
i
think
it
would.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
i
say
it's
not
local.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
possibly
not.
but
that
is
not
the
case.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
well,
i
dc/won't
think
we're
called
upon
to
draw
the
line
in
this
case
because
we
have
gone
so
far
the
other
side
of
the
line,
i
think
it's
unquestioned
whether
we
would
draw
at
it
at
five,
six,
seven,
or
eight,
i
don't
know.
but
here,
we
--
we've
got
a
board
with
control
over
17
institutions.
in
the
university
of
texas
in
austin
alone,
they
have
40,000
students
and
over
7000
employees
on
a
265-acre
campus.
and
when
you
include
all
the
other
campuses
and
institutions
on
part
which
say
how
many
people
involved
but
many,
many
thousands
and
they're
placed
under
this
regulation.
and
they
have
the
undoubted
force
and
effect
of
a
statute
according
to
the
pronouncement
of
the
texas
supreme
court.
and
that
is
our
basis
for
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
from
a
direct
appeal
from
a
three-judge
federal
court.
now,
if
i
may
address
myself
to
how
this
case
came
about,
it
was
born
out
of
an
effort
of
the
board
of
regents
to
enforce
its
solicitation
rule
on
the
campus
at
the
university
of
texas
at
austin
against
a
group
known
as
the
new
left
education
group
and
a
--
a
number
of
individuals
that
were
selling
on
the
campus
a
newspaper
known
as
rag
not
in
conformity
with
the
rules
applicable
to
the
sale
of
newspapers.
the
regents
after
local
administration
at
the
campus
after
repeated
efforts
and
warning
to
these
people
and
to
stop,
as
the
attorney
general's
office
to
institute
a
civil
injunction
proceeding
in
the
state
district
court,
travis
county
to
enforce
their
rule.
we
filed
this
injunction
suit,
and
shortly
thereafter,
the
selfsame
defendants
in
the
state
court
action
went
to
the
united
states
district
court
and
filed
an
action
there
asking
that
the
rules
be
declared
unconstitutional,
that
the
regents
be
enjoined
from
enforcing
them
and
that
the
prosecution
of
this
civil
injunctive
suit
and
the
state
court
be
enjoined.
we
pointed
out
to
the
court
by
pleaded
that
2283
in
our
explanation,
an
injunction
statute,
prohibited
this
very
action
in
the
united
states
district
court.
mainly
thereafter,
the
pleadings
of
the
plaintiffs
in
the
united
states
district
court
were
amended
to
bring
in
young
democrats
and
seven
or
eight
individuals.
now,
reading
that
pleading
as
a
whole
in
the
motion,
i
think
it's
undoubted,
they
all
claim
to
be
members
of
a
common
class
of
people
who
claim
that
their
constitutional
rights
are
being
infringed
by
the
enforcement
of
this
rule.
now,
the
group
of
individuals,
i
don't
think
ever
presented
a
case
or
controversy
for
the
court
to
act
upon.
they
merely
said
in
the
pleading
that
we
are
interested
in
the
free
flow
and
dissemination
of
information
on
the
campus
of
the
university.
there
was
never
any
evidence
produced
or
any
stipulation
or
any
affidavits
filed
by
them
that
showed
in
any
manner
how
these
rules
had
been
enforced
against
them
or
how
they
had
prohibited
them
from
obtaining
any
specific
article,
printed
matter
or
hearing
any
speech
that
they
desired
to
hear.
there
simply
was
no
factual
basis
in
the
complaint.
there
was
never
any
adduced
to
show
that
they
presented
any
justiciable
controversy
with
regard
to
these
rules.
so
consequently,
they
stand
largely
ignored
throughout
this
entire
proceeding.
shortly
after,
the
young
democrats
intervened.
they
didn't
beg
upon,
they
didn't
intervene.
they
came
in
by
way
of
the
first
amended
complaint.
they
ask
for
the
same
relief
that
the
original
parties,
plaintiff
asked
for
with
the
exception
they
didn't
ask
that
the
state
court
proceeding
be
enjoined.
shortly
after
this,
by
a
motion
to
intervene
a
group
known
as
the
young
socialist
alliance
were
allowed
into
the
case.
they
adopted
the
prior
pleadings
as
their
own.
now,
it's
our
position
that
all
of
these
parties
at
this
point
in
the
proceeding
pled
themselves
to
be
members
of
the
common
class
of
people
on
the
university
or
campus
at
austin
who
desired
to
solicit
in
violation
of
the
regent
solicitation
rules
and
that
their
acts
under
the
first
amendment
were
being
infringed
and
asked
for
the
same
relief,
everyone
of
them,
that
rule
be
declared
invalid
and
it
be
enjoined.
the
next
event
that
occurred
was
a
hearing
before
the
united
states
district
court
three-judge
panel
at
which
the
arguments
were
made
concerning
2283
and
that
court
then
entered
what
i
consider
to
be
a
rather
strange
order.
it
divided
this
class
of
plaintiffs
in
the
united
states
district
court
into
two
groups
and
denominated
them
as
class
a
and
class
b.
it
never
did
say
that
they
had
distinct
and
individual
claims
or
causes
of
action
that
their
actions
were
definitely
just
dividing
them
into
two
groups
within
the
class,
class
a
and
class
b.
and
it
says,
“class
a,
you're
the
people
that
are
defendants
over
in
the
state
court
action.
now,
we're
going
to
dismiss
you
to
go
back
over
to
the
state
court,
we're
going
to
dismiss
you
almost.
said
we're
going
to
retain
jurisdiction,
in
the
event
they
do
something
to
united
states
court
that
can't
be
condoned,
then
you
can
come
back
here
and
ask
for
relief.
we'll
retain
jurisdiction
to
that
extent.”
so
with
things
in
that
posture,
we
proceeded
to
the
state
court
and
obtained
temporary
after
a
full
hearing.
and
the
record
reveals
that
in
the
state
court,
these
parties
defendant,
there
were
parties
plaintiff
in
the
federal
court,
pled
and
raised
the
same
constitutional
objections
that
they
were
pleading
in
the
federal
court,
if
you
please,
violated
first
amendment
right,
protection
under
fourteenth
amendment.
these
were
argued
to
the
state
district
court
after
a
full
hearing
on
temporary
injunction,
witnesses
testify,
counsel
for
all
parties
in
the
federal
and
state
court
proceeding
were
the
same.
the
state
district
court
then
entered
a
temporary
injunction,
specifically
finding
that
the
rules
were
constitutional
and
temporarily
enjoining
the
defendants
and
all
others
acting
in
concert
with
them
from
soliciting
by
means
of
the
newspaper
known
as
rag
on
the
university
of
texas
campus
at
austin,
other
than
in
conformity
with
the
solicitation
rule.
we
next
in
the
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
they
--
the
new
left
together
with
a
group
of
individuals
who
were
members
of
the
new
left
organization,
there
were
some
individuals
six
or
eight
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
--
individuals.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
we
are
--
we
claim
that
they
are
here
by
virtual
representation
of
the
rest
of
their
class
that
they
left
over
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
no,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
but
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
but
there
are
contentions
with
regard
to
the
relation
between
these
two
segments
of
the
class.
they're
essentially,
it's
essential
to
refer
to
them
into
this
case.
and
it's
essential
to
our
contentions
that
we
keep
reference
to
them
here
because
our
contention
is
that
this
--
first,
that
the
state
court
judgment,
the
temporary
injunction
was
res
judicata
as
to
the
remainder
of
the
class
has
stayed
in
--
in
the
federal
court.
they
were
admittedly
part
of
the
same
class.
we
got
a
temporary
injunction
in
the
federal
and
the
state
court
which
held
the
provisions
constitutional.
now
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
yes,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
under
texas
law
and
under
the
federal
law,
even
on
a
temporary
injunction
hearing,
if
issues
which
go
to
the
very
heart
of
the
merits
of
the
case
are
decided
on
that
temporary
injunction,
then
that
judgment
is
final
as
to
those
purposes.
now,
i'm
sure
that
it
must
be
obvious
to
everyone
concerned
in
the
matter
that
are
--
if
we
go
back
to
the
state
court
and
have
a
hearing
on
permanent
injunction
or
to
make
this
temporary
injunction
permanent,
the
court
is
certainly
not
going
to
reconsider
and
pass
on
the
constitutionality
under
the
first
amendment
and
fourteenth
amendments
again,
he's
already
done
it.
he
said
these
rules
are
constitutional.
it
couldn't
be
anymore
final
on
the
question
of
constitutionality
whether
it'd
be
temporary
or
not.we
feel
that
under
england
versus
louisiana,
the
medical
examiners
where
the
group
went
to
the
state
court,
didn't
reserve
their
federal
question,
came
back
to
the
federal
court.
they
said,
“you
preclude
it.”
it's
our
contention
that
under
the
atlantic
coast
line
railway
engineers
case,
2283
is
a
--
is
a
specific
bar
because
here,
the
regents
are
enjoined
from
enforcing
this
rule.
could
we
go
back
to
the
state
court
now
and
ask
them
to
hold
this
people
in
contempt?
have
the
clarity
of
doing
it
because
i
think
we'll
be
right
back
to
the
federal
district
court
being
held
in
contempt
ourselves.
we've
got
a
--
a
direct
conflict
between
the
jurisdiction
of
the
two
courts,
the
decision
of
the
two
courts
in
complete
conflict
and
they
had
a
adequate
remedy,
appealing
that
decision
of
the
state
court.
it
was
entered
before
the
federal
court
ever
undertook
to
decide
the
issue.
and
it's
our
contention
that
the
federal
court
should've
left
the
matter
alone
to
be
proceeded
through
the
state
courts
and
eventually
up
here.
as
it
is,
the
--
the
district
court,
there
said
in
a
review
of
what
state
court
did
so
to
speak.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
it's
still
in
effect.
under
our
--
under
our
procedure
though,
there
is
a
way
to
go
in
and
make
a
motion
to
set
it
aside
or
open
it
to
modify.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
no,
as
far
as
they're
--
they're
remedy
to
that
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
they
may
have
it
--
try
to
have
it
set
aside.
in
other
words
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
--
it
hasn't
become
irrevocably
final
in
that
respect.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
that's
correct.
that's
--
that's
why
we're
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
no,
no.
there
never
had.
they
merely
proceeded
over
to
the
federal
court,
moved
for
summary
judgment
and
into
a
cross
motion
to
dismiss.
the
court
entered
summary
judgment
in
their
favor
and
denied
our
motion
to
dismiss,
over
all
these
contentions
we
made
about
the
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
no.
in
--
but
in
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
it's
our
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
but
it's
our
contention
that
their
--
their
part
impartially
of
the
same
group.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
but
the
a
group
made
the
same
contentions.
they
return
in
the
guise
of
the
b
group
with
the
same
counsel
and
argued
the
same
question.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
but
here,
in
this
court
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
but
if
your
honor
will
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
correct,
your
honor.
but
if
you
will
look
at
the
order
entered
which
is
on
-
begins
on
page
41
--
on
page
42.
the
court
finds
that
it
should
not
at
this
time
exercise
its
jurisdiction
as
to
that
part
of
a
that
request
injunctive
relief
against
the
proceedings
in
the
167th
judicial
court
of
travis
county,
texas
because
the
extraordinary
circumstances
require
machesky
for
this
type
of
relief
were
not
presented
this
time.
similarly,
the
court
concludes
that
prior
for
these
claims
for
declaratory
relief
considered
separately
should
be
denied
at
this
time
in
the
exercise
of
the
court's
discretion.
dropping
on
down
is
that
accordingly,
this
portion
of
this
plaintiffs
complaint
requesting
declaratory
relief
and
injunctive
relief
against
the
state
procedure
to
dismiss
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
--
or
to
be
no
interference.
this
court
however,
retains
jurisdiction
over
that
part
of
the
case
which
is
--
rest
whether
appropriate
relief
against
the
defendants
when
such
relief
become
necessary.
or
when,
the
dismissal
is
done
without
prejudice
to
their
right
to
return
again
under
machesky.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
so
it's
kind
of
--
within,
within
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
yes,
your
honor.
it's
--
it's
within,
within.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
we
dismiss
for
one
purpose
but
not
for
the
other.
now,
if
i
may
address
myself
briefly
to
the
merits
of
this
case
it
would
--
it
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
alright,
your
honor.
the
--
there
is
no
showing
in
this
case
that
there
has
been
an
arbitrary
assignment
of
places
on
the
campus
at
the
university
of
texas
at
austin
for
the
distribution
and
sale
of
newspapers
from
vending
machines.
there
--
the
stipulation
shows
that
there
are
12
newspapers
currently
selling
from
these
designated
places
from
vending
machines
without
any
problem.
this
people
haven't
shown
that
unless
they
can
go
around
over
the
campus
free
at
will
if
they're
going
to
go
out
of
business.
they
haven't
shown
any
irreparable
injury.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
for
a
while
sold
at
one
of
these
locations
out
of
a
vending
machine.
it's
a
--
this
is
a
highly
congested
campus,
there's
evidence
in
the
record
that
students
--
one
student
made
in
her
affidavit,
said,
she'd
been
accosted
by
these
people
on
the
campus.
they
bother
her
in
the
free
use
of
the
campus.
there
is
evidence
that
solicitations
in
laboratory
buildings
and
classrooms
had
disrupted
classes
that
the
same
thing
had
occurred
in
the
dormitories
on
previous
occasions.
now,
with
this
background,
the
regents
certainly
had
the
authority
to
authorize
the
administration
to
designate
where
the
administrations
felt
that
these
things
could
be
sold
from
vending
machines
without
interfering
with
the
operation
of
the
university.
now,
this
court
has
recognized
in
(inaudible)
and
cox
that
where
a
public
property
is
dedicated
to
a
special
use,
that
rules
and
regulations
can
be
maintained
even
only
infringe
upon
first
amendment
rights
in
order
to
maintain
that
property
for
that
use.
and
that's
all
that's
done
here.
there's
been
no
showing
whatsoever
of
any
disadvantage
by
virtue
of
the
place
designated.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
your
honor,
there's
only
one
free
speech
area
at
the
austin
campus
and
that's
--
it's
a
patio
out
for
the
union
building,
it's
designated
as
such.
they
maintain
that
the
malls
of
the
university
are
free
speech
areas.
well,
our
affidavits
show
that
they've
never
been
maintained
as
free
speech
areas
on
the
campus.
in
those,
speakers
don't
speak
there.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
anywhere
they
want
to
go,
that's
what
they've
been
doing,
roaming
free
at
will
all
over
the
campus,
sat
along
with
other
people.
since
this
case
has
been
decided,
we've
had
all
sorts
of
people
out
there
selling
their
newspapers
and
their
pamphlets
and
running
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
from
a
vending
machine.
just
as
this
court
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
solicitation
of
dues.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
dues
for
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
--
campus
organizations.
they
have
been
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
no,
sir.
but
there's
another
regulation
that
says,
they
may
do
it
at
registration
or
they
may
do
at
their
meetings
on
the
campus,
but
they
can't
just
set
up
dues
(inaudible).
we
have
over
400
registered
student
organizations
on
that
campus.
and
if
all
of
them
starts
soliciting
their
dues
in
membership
up
and
down
the
malls
freely
at
will
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
--
we
wouldn't
have
much
free
access
for
everybody
else.
and
can
you
imagine
them
jumping
out
there
harassing
every
passerby
going
to
our
organization,
here
--
here
is
how
much
our
dues
are.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
your
honor,
those
are
one
--
one
shot
organization.
they
are
university
connected,
one
of
them
was
the
acappella
choir
trying
to
raise
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
--
some
money
for
--
the
other
was
to
go
to
the
east
austin
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
--
poor
people.
now,
we
have
--
we
have
conceded
in
here
that
the
rule
which
allows
solicitation
for
charitable
and
benevolent
purposes
is
invalid
in
that
respect,
because
it
does
--
it
--
it's
indeed
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
--
with
that.
so
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
correct.
we
--
we
don't
defend
that
rule
in
that
regard.
it
--
it
does
have
a
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
they
have
different
regulations
about
that
for
posting
of
signs,
certain
candidates
can
--
they
have
to
have
permission
to
post
the
signs
and
may
post
them
in
specified
locations.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
no,
i
don't
think
they
do.
no.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
no,
sir.
they
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
--
they
restrict
those
activities
under
a
different
rule.
they
have
places
and
ways
they
can
put
up
a
sign
that
does
not
--
doesn't
appear,
they
can
keep
it
there
and
it's
a
different
rule
entirely.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
being
talked
to
them
in
the
classroom
and
take
over
the
class
and
start
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
--
make
a
political
speech.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
in
the
hallways.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
in
the
hallways,
i'm
sure
they
can.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
no,
i'm
not
sure
that
it's
that
free
but
that
question
isn't
involved
here
and
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
--
that
rule
is
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
we
have
a
very
small
percentage
of
people
that
even
vote
now
on
that
campus.
they're
not
all
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
that's
correct.
my
time
is
up.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
w.
o.
shultz,
an
assistant
attorney
general
from
the
state
of
texas.
i'm
representing
the
board
of
regents
in
this
case
this
morning.
initially
since
this
court
postponed
jurisdiction
until
argument
i
address
myself
briefly
to
this
jurisdictional
question.
the
only
objection
which
appellee
raises
in
his
brief
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
is
--
concerned
itself
with
the
fact
that
there
is
a
coordinating
board
in
the
state
of
texas
and
the
appellant
contends
that
is
a
higher
authority
that
has
statewide
jurisdiction
and
the
board
of
regents
is
somehow
under
yet
with
regard
to
its
rules
and
regulations.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
this
is
not
so.
the
act
creating
the
coordinating
board
and
makes
it
precisely
that,
a
coordinating
board.
its
primary
purposes
are
to
coordinate
the
degree
programs
through
the
institutions
in
the
state
of
texas.
our
higher
education
set
up
several
of
the
colleges,
have
their
own
board
of
regents.
the
university
of
texas
of
course
has
a
systemwide
campus
setup.
we
have
a
--
campuses
in
el
paso,
arlington,
dallas,
odessa,
midland,
houston,
galveston,
port
aransas,
san
antonio.
these
are
all
under
the
direction
of
the
board
of
regents.
and
the
primary
purpose
of
the
coordinating
board
is
to
coordinate
degree
programs
in
all
the
colleges.
and
then
before
a
college
can
institute
a
new
degree
program,
they
must
get
approval
to
the
coordinating
board.
the
act
creating
the
board
specifically
says
that
it
shall
have
only
such
powers
as
are
given
to
it
in
the
board,
i
mean
in
the
act
in
any
power
which
one
of
the
governing
boards
of
an
institution
of
higher
education
has
that
are
not
specifically
delegated
to
the
coordinating
board.
the
coordinating
board
does
not
have
and
there's
no
provision
in
the
coordinating
board
act
which
gives
them
the
authority
to
promulgate
rules
and
regulations
which
are
applicable
to
any
other
campuses
with
regard
to
the
day-to-day
operation
of
those
campuses.
at
the
last
session
of
the
legislature,
there
was
a
codification
of
--
of
the
various
education
acts,
they
were
put
into
an
education
code.
well,
this
coordinating
board
act
was
incorporated
in
the
education
code.
at
the
same
time,
same
session
of
the
legislature,
there
was
an
act
passed
applying
specifically
to
the
board
of
regents
of
the
university
of
texas
system,
it's
art.
2585e,
vernon's
civil
statute
and
just
recently
been
codified
as
such.
section
1
of
that
act
reaffirms
the
powers
of
the
board
of
regents
to
promulgate
rules
and
regulations
applicable
systemwide
and
may
--
may
i
quote
--
if
i
may
quote
briefly,
it
says
authority
--
the
board
has
authority
“to
promulgate
and
enforce
such
other
rules
and
regulations
for
the
operation,
control
and
management
of
the
university
of
texas
system,
and
the
component
institutions
thereof
as
the
board
of
regents
of
the
university
of
texas
system
may
deem
either
necessary
or
desirable.”
section
5
of
that
act
says,
and
i
quote,
“this
act
is
cumulative
of
all
statutes
relating
to
the
university
of
texas
system
or
any
of
the
component
institutions
of
the
university
of
texas
system,
except
where
--
where
such
statute
may
be
in
conflict
with
this
act.
if
any
such
conflict
arises,
the
conflicting
statute
is
hereof
by
repeal
to
the
extent
of
that
conflict.”
so
here,
we
have,
i
think
all
doubt
removed
as
to
any
primary
authority
in
the
coordinating
board
as
to
its
regulatory
power,
veto
power
of
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
board
of
regents.
now,
on
the
texas
law,
our
texas
supreme
court
has
held
that
the
regulations
and
rules
of
the
board
of
regents
of
university
of
texas
are
the
equivalent
of
statutory
enactments,
they
are
laws.
i
think
that
since
these
regulations
are
systemwide
and
cover
a
substantial
area
of
the
state.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
they
are
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
yes,
your
honor,
there
are.
they're
not
part
of
the
university
of
texas
system
however.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
they
apply
to
all
schools
and
institutions
within
the
university
of
texas
system,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
(voice
overlap)
oh,
i
think
they
--
they
say
they
--
they
have
17
component
institutions
in
the
system.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
that's
correct,
your
honor.
there's
--
university
of
texas
at
austin,
university
of
texas
at
el
paso,
university
of
texas
at
permian
basin,
university
of
texas
at
dallas,
university
of
texas
at
san
antonio,
and
there's
the
university
of
texas
med
school
in
galveston,
the
tumor
center
in
--
school
in
houston,
a
south
west
med
school
in
dallas,
nursing
school
in
houston,
the
institute
of
marine
sciences
in
port
aransas.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
they're
all
the
university
of
texas
system.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
some
of
them
have
their
own
individual
boards
of
regents.
we
have
north
texas
state
university,
it
has
its
own
board
of
regents
by
itself.
we
have
texas
woman's
university,
it
has
its
own
board
of
regents
by
itself,
they
have
one
campus
only.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
none
i
think
other
than
that
they
all
got
their
money
from
the
appropriation
from
the
texas
legislature.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
they
only
states
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
not
as
far
as
regulating
the
hiring
and
firing,
the
day-to-day
operation
in
the
school,
the
rules
and
regulations.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
pardon?
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
to
do
--
to
do
--
that
has
this
power?
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
the
coordinating
board
has
to
the
extent
it
has
power
to
--
to
try
to
coordinate
the
degree
programs.
it
--
it
was
primarily
established
to
--
we
--
we
had
rather
a
hodgepodge
in
our
higher
education
system
frankly
to
try
and
keep
duplication
of
degree
programs
and
efforts
at
the
various
schools
to
a
minimum
by
requiring
approval
for
institution
of
new
degree
programs
or
the
establishment
of
a
new
college
or
school
within
the
particular
university.
they
--
they
set
there
the
supreme
powers
and
well,
now
this
school
has
--
already
has
a
pretty
good
program
that
that
--
and
that
--
feel
now,
do
we
need
one
at
this
school?
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
that's
a
matter
of
dispute,
mr.
justice
marshall.our
constitution
said
that
texas
a&m
is
a
branch
of
the
university
of
texas
but
it
has
operated
under
its
own
board
of
regents
for
many,
many
years.
the
only
--
the
only
common
thing
they
share
is
that
texas
a&m
university
gets
a
part
of
the
permanent
endowment
fund
that
was
set
aside
to
the
university
of
texas
under
the
constitution
of
1876.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
it
is
as
far
as
its
operation
is
concerned,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
that's
true.
it's
not
a
part
of
the
university
of
texas
system.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
it
applies
to
every
institution
under
the
control
of
the
board
of
regents
of
the
university
of
texas
system.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
no,
your
honor.
we've
never
made
that
contention.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
i
--
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
once
--
once
the
rule
or
regulation
itself,
it's
applicable
to
all
the
institutions
under
this
board's
control
and
those
boards
are
statewide.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
i
think
it
would.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
i
say
it's
not
local.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
possibly
not.
but
that
is
not
the
case.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
well,
i
dc/won't
think
we're
called
upon
to
draw
the
line
in
this
case
because
we
have
gone
so
far
the
other
side
of
the
line,
i
think
it's
unquestioned
whether
we
would
draw
at
it
at
five,
six,
seven,
or
eight,
i
don't
know.
but
here,
we
--
we've
got
a
board
with
control
over
17
institutions.
in
the
university
of
texas
in
austin
alone,
they
have
40,000
students
and
over
7000
employees
on
a
265-acre
campus.
and
when
you
include
all
the
other
campuses
and
institutions
on
part
which
say
how
many
people
involved
but
many,
many
thousands
and
they're
placed
under
this
regulation.
and
they
have
the
undoubted
force
and
effect
of
a
statute
according
to
the
pronouncement
of
the
texas
supreme
court.
and
that
is
our
basis
for
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
from
a
direct
appeal
from
a
three-judge
federal
court.
now,
if
i
may
address
myself
to
how
this
case
came
about,
it
was
born
out
of
an
effort
of
the
board
of
regents
to
enforce
its
solicitation
rule
on
the
campus
at
the
university
of
texas
at
austin
against
a
group
known
as
the
new
left
education
group
and
a
--
a
number
of
individuals
that
were
selling
on
the
campus
a
newspaper
known
as
rag
not
in
conformity
with
the
rules
applicable
to
the
sale
of
newspapers.
the
regents
after
local
administration
at
the
campus
after
repeated
efforts
and
warning
to
these
people
and
to
stop,
as
the
attorney
general's
office
to
institute
a
civil
injunction
proceeding
in
the
state
district
court,
travis
county
to
enforce
their
rule.
we
filed
this
injunction
suit,
and
shortly
thereafter,
the
selfsame
defendants
in
the
state
court
action
went
to
the
united
states
district
court
and
filed
an
action
there
asking
that
the
rules
be
declared
unconstitutional,
that
the
regents
be
enjoined
from
enforcing
them
and
that
the
prosecution
of
this
civil
injunctive
suit
and
the
state
court
be
enjoined.
we
pointed
out
to
the
court
by
pleaded
that
2283
in
our
explanation,
an
injunction
statute,
prohibited
this
very
action
in
the
united
states
district
court.
mainly
thereafter,
the
pleadings
of
the
plaintiffs
in
the
united
states
district
court
were
amended
to
bring
in
young
democrats
and
seven
or
eight
individuals.
now,
reading
that
pleading
as
a
whole
in
the
motion,
i
think
it's
undoubted,
they
all
claim
to
be
members
of
a
common
class
of
people
who
claim
that
their
constitutional
rights
are
being
infringed
by
the
enforcement
of
this
rule.
now,
the
group
of
individuals,
i
don't
think
ever
presented
a
case
or
controversy
for
the
court
to
act
upon.
they
merely
said
in
the
pleading
that
we
are
interested
in
the
free
flow
and
dissemination
of
information
on
the
campus
of
the
university.
there
was
never
any
evidence
produced
or
any
stipulation
or
any
affidavits
filed
by
them
that
showed
in
any
manner
how
these
rules
had
been
enforced
against
them
or
how
they
had
prohibited
them
from
obtaining
any
specific
article,
printed
matter
or
hearing
any
speech
that
they
desired
to
hear.
there
simply
was
no
factual
basis
in
the
complaint.
there
was
never
any
adduced
to
show
that
they
presented
any
justiciable
controversy
with
regard
to
these
rules.
so
consequently,
they
stand
largely
ignored
throughout
this
entire
proceeding.
shortly
after,
the
young
democrats
intervened.
they
didn't
beg
upon,
they
didn't
intervene.
they
came
in
by
way
of
the
first
amended
complaint.
they
ask
for
the
same
relief
that
the
original
parties,
plaintiff
asked
for
with
the
exception
they
didn't
ask
that
the
state
court
proceeding
be
enjoined.
shortly
after
this,
by
a
motion
to
intervene
a
group
known
as
the
young
socialist
alliance
were
allowed
into
the
case.
they
adopted
the
prior
pleadings
as
their
own.
now,
it's
our
position
that
all
of
these
parties
at
this
point
in
the
proceeding
pled
themselves
to
be
members
of
the
common
class
of
people
on
the
university
or
campus
at
austin
who
desired
to
solicit
in
violation
of
the
regent
solicitation
rules
and
that
their
acts
under
the
first
amendment
were
being
infringed
and
asked
for
the
same
relief,
everyone
of
them,
that
rule
be
declared
invalid
and
it
be
enjoined.
the
next
event
that
occurred
was
a
hearing
before
the
united
states
district
court
three-judge
panel
at
which
the
arguments
were
made
concerning
2283
and
that
court
then
entered
what
i
consider
to
be
a
rather
strange
order.
it
divided
this
class
of
plaintiffs
in
the
united
states
district
court
into
two
groups
and
denominated
them
as
class
a
and
class
b.
it
never
did
say
that
they
had
distinct
and
individual
claims
or
causes
of
action
that
their
actions
were
definitely
just
dividing
them
into
two
groups
within
the
class,
class
a
and
class
b.
and
it
says,
“class
a,
you're
the
people
that
are
defendants
over
in
the
state
court
action.
now,
we're
going
to
dismiss
you
to
go
back
over
to
the
state
court,
we're
going
to
dismiss
you
almost.
said
we're
going
to
retain
jurisdiction,
in
the
event
they
do
something
to
united
states
court
that
can't
be
condoned,
then
you
can
come
back
here
and
ask
for
relief.
we'll
retain
jurisdiction
to
that
extent.”
so
with
things
in
that
posture,
we
proceeded
to
the
state
court
and
obtained
temporary
after
a
full
hearing.
and
the
record
reveals
that
in
the
state
court,
these
parties
defendant,
there
were
parties
plaintiff
in
the
federal
court,
pled
and
raised
the
same
constitutional
objections
that
they
were
pleading
in
the
federal
court,
if
you
please,
violated
first
amendment
right,
protection
under
fourteenth
amendment.
these
were
argued
to
the
state
district
court
after
a
full
hearing
on
temporary
injunction,
witnesses
testify,
counsel
for
all
parties
in
the
federal
and
state
court
proceeding
were
the
same.
the
state
district
court
then
entered
a
temporary
injunction,
specifically
finding
that
the
rules
were
constitutional
and
temporarily
enjoining
the
defendants
and
all
others
acting
in
concert
with
them
from
soliciting
by
means
of
the
newspaper
known
as
rag
on
the
university
of
texas
campus
at
austin,
other
than
in
conformity
with
the
solicitation
rule.
we
next
in
the
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
they
--
the
new
left
together
with
a
group
of
individuals
who
were
members
of
the
new
left
organization,
there
were
some
individuals
six
or
eight
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
--
individuals.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
we
are
--
we
claim
that
they
are
here
by
virtual
representation
of
the
rest
of
their
class
that
they
left
over
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
no,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
but
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
but
there
are
contentions
with
regard
to
the
relation
between
these
two
segments
of
the
class.
they're
essentially,
it's
essential
to
refer
to
them
into
this
case.
and
it's
essential
to
our
contentions
that
we
keep
reference
to
them
here
because
our
contention
is
that
this
--
first,
that
the
state
court
judgment,
the
temporary
injunction
was
res
judicata
as
to
the
remainder
of
the
class
has
stayed
in
--
in
the
federal
court.
they
were
admittedly
part
of
the
same
class.
we
got
a
temporary
injunction
in
the
federal
and
the
state
court
which
held
the
provisions
constitutional.
now
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
yes,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
under
texas
law
and
under
the
federal
law,
even
on
a
temporary
injunction
hearing,
if
issues
which
go
to
the
very
heart
of
the
merits
of
the
case
are
decided
on
that
temporary
injunction,
then
that
judgment
is
final
as
to
those
purposes.
now,
i'm
sure
that
it
must
be
obvious
to
everyone
concerned
in
the
matter
that
are
--
if
we
go
back
to
the
state
court
and
have
a
hearing
on
permanent
injunction
or
to
make
this
temporary
injunction
permanent,
the
court
is
certainly
not
going
to
reconsider
and
pass
on
the
constitutionality
under
the
first
amendment
and
fourteenth
amendments
again,
he's
already
done
it.
he
said
these
rules
are
constitutional.
it
couldn't
be
anymore
final
on
the
question
of
constitutionality
whether
it'd
be
temporary
or
not.we
feel
that
under
england
versus
louisiana,
the
medical
examiners
where
the
group
went
to
the
state
court,
didn't
reserve
their
federal
question,
came
back
to
the
federal
court.
they
said,
“you
preclude
it.”
it's
our
contention
that
under
the
atlantic
coast
line
railway
engineers
case,
2283
is
a
--
is
a
specific
bar
because
here,
the
regents
are
enjoined
from
enforcing
this
rule.
could
we
go
back
to
the
state
court
now
and
ask
them
to
hold
this
people
in
contempt?
have
the
clarity
of
doing
it
because
i
think
we'll
be
right
back
to
the
federal
district
court
being
held
in
contempt
ourselves.
we've
got
a
--
a
direct
conflict
between
the
jurisdiction
of
the
two
courts,
the
decision
of
the
two
courts
in
complete
conflict
and
they
had
a
adequate
remedy,
appealing
that
decision
of
the
state
court.
it
was
entered
before
the
federal
court
ever
undertook
to
decide
the
issue.
and
it's
our
contention
that
the
federal
court
should've
left
the
matter
alone
to
be
proceeded
through
the
state
courts
and
eventually
up
here.
as
it
is,
the
--
the
district
court,
there
said
in
a
review
of
what
state
court
did
so
to
speak.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
it's
still
in
effect.
under
our
--
under
our
procedure
though,
there
is
a
way
to
go
in
and
make
a
motion
to
set
it
aside
or
open
it
to
modify.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
no,
as
far
as
they're
--
they're
remedy
to
that
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
they
may
have
it
--
try
to
have
it
set
aside.
in
other
words
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
--
it
hasn't
become
irrevocably
final
in
that
respect.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
that's
correct.
that's
--
that's
why
we're
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
no,
no.
there
never
had.
they
merely
proceeded
over
to
the
federal
court,
moved
for
summary
judgment
and
into
a
cross
motion
to
dismiss.
the
court
entered
summary
judgment
in
their
favor
and
denied
our
motion
to
dismiss,
over
all
these
contentions
we
made
about
the
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
no.
in
--
but
in
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
it's
our
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
but
it's
our
contention
that
their
--
their
part
impartially
of
the
same
group.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
but
the
a
group
made
the
same
contentions.
they
return
in
the
guise
of
the
b
group
with
the
same
counsel
and
argued
the
same
question.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
but
here,
in
this
court
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
but
if
your
honor
will
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
correct,
your
honor.
but
if
you
will
look
at
the
order
entered
which
is
on
-
begins
on
page
41
--
on
page
42.
the
court
finds
that
it
should
not
at
this
time
exercise
its
jurisdiction
as
to
that
part
of
a
that
request
injunctive
relief
against
the
proceedings
in
the
167th
judicial
court
of
travis
county,
texas
because
the
extraordinary
circumstances
require
machesky
for
this
type
of
relief
were
not
presented
this
time.
similarly,
the
court
concludes
that
prior
for
these
claims
for
declaratory
relief
considered
separately
should
be
denied
at
this
time
in
the
exercise
of
the
court's
discretion.
dropping
on
down
is
that
accordingly,
this
portion
of
this
plaintiffs
complaint
requesting
declaratory
relief
and
injunctive
relief
against
the
state
procedure
to
dismiss
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
--
or
to
be
no
interference.
this
court
however,
retains
jurisdiction
over
that
part
of
the
case
which
is
--
rest
whether
appropriate
relief
against
the
defendants
when
such
relief
become
necessary.
or
when,
the
dismissal
is
done
without
prejudice
to
their
right
to
return
again
under
machesky.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
so
it's
kind
of
--
within,
within
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
yes,
your
honor.
it's
--
it's
within,
within.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
we
dismiss
for
one
purpose
but
not
for
the
other.
now,
if
i
may
address
myself
briefly
to
the
merits
of
this
case
it
would
--
it
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
alright,
your
honor.
the
--
there
is
no
showing
in
this
case
that
there
has
been
an
arbitrary
assignment
of
places
on
the
campus
at
the
university
of
texas
at
austin
for
the
distribution
and
sale
of
newspapers
from
vending
machines.
there
--
the
stipulation
shows
that
there
are
12
newspapers
currently
selling
from
these
designated
places
from
vending
machines
without
any
problem.
this
people
haven't
shown
that
unless
they
can
go
around
over
the
campus
free
at
will
if
they're
going
to
go
out
of
business.
they
haven't
shown
any
irreparable
injury.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
for
a
while
sold
at
one
of
these
locations
out
of
a
vending
machine.
it's
a
--
this
is
a
highly
congested
campus,
there's
evidence
in
the
record
that
students
--
one
student
made
in
her
affidavit,
said,
she'd
been
accosted
by
these
people
on
the
campus.
they
bother
her
in
the
free
use
of
the
campus.
there
is
evidence
that
solicitations
in
laboratory
buildings
and
classrooms
had
disrupted
classes
that
the
same
thing
had
occurred
in
the
dormitories
on
previous
occasions.
now,
with
this
background,
the
regents
certainly
had
the
authority
to
authorize
the
administration
to
designate
where
the
administrations
felt
that
these
things
could
be
sold
from
vending
machines
without
interfering
with
the
operation
of
the
university.
now,
this
court
has
recognized
in
(inaudible)
and
cox
that
where
a
public
property
is
dedicated
to
a
special
use,
that
rules
and
regulations
can
be
maintained
even
only
infringe
upon
first
amendment
rights
in
order
to
maintain
that
property
for
that
use.
and
that's
all
that's
done
here.
there's
been
no
showing
whatsoever
of
any
disadvantage
by
virtue
of
the
place
designated.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
your
honor,
there's
only
one
free
speech
area
at
the
austin
campus
and
that's
--
it's
a
patio
out
for
the
union
building,
it's
designated
as
such.
they
maintain
that
the
malls
of
the
university
are
free
speech
areas.
well,
our
affidavits
show
that
they've
never
been
maintained
as
free
speech
areas
on
the
campus.
in
those,
speakers
don't
speak
there.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
anywhere
they
want
to
go,
that's
what
they've
been
doing,
roaming
free
at
will
all
over
the
campus,
sat
along
with
other
people.
since
this
case
has
been
decided,
we've
had
all
sorts
of
people
out
there
selling
their
newspapers
and
their
pamphlets
and
running
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
from
a
vending
machine.
just
as
this
court
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
solicitation
of
dues.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
dues
for
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
--
campus
organizations.
they
have
been
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
no,
sir.
but
there's
another
regulation
that
says,
they
may
do
it
at
registration
or
they
may
do
at
their
meetings
on
the
campus,
but
they
can't
just
set
up
dues
(inaudible).
we
have
over
400
registered
student
organizations
on
that
campus.
and
if
all
of
them
starts
soliciting
their
dues
in
membership
up
and
down
the
malls
freely
at
will
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
--
we
wouldn't
have
much
free
access
for
everybody
else.
and
can
you
imagine
them
jumping
out
there
harassing
every
passerby
going
to
our
organization,
here
--
here
is
how
much
our
dues
are.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
your
honor,
those
are
one
--
one
shot
organization.
they
are
university
connected,
one
of
them
was
the
acappella
choir
trying
to
raise
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
--
some
money
for
--
the
other
was
to
go
to
the
east
austin
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
--
poor
people.
now,
we
have
--
we
have
conceded
in
here
that
the
rule
which
allows
solicitation
for
charitable
and
benevolent
purposes
is
invalid
in
that
respect,
because
it
does
--
it
--
it's
indeed
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
--
with
that.
so
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
correct.
we
--
we
don't
defend
that
rule
in
that
regard.
it
--
it
does
have
a
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
they
have
different
regulations
about
that
for
posting
of
signs,
certain
candidates
can
--
they
have
to
have
permission
to
post
the
signs
and
may
post
them
in
specified
locations.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
no,
i
don't
think
they
do.
no.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
no,
sir.
they
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
--
they
restrict
those
activities
under
a
different
rule.
they
have
places
and
ways
they
can
put
up
a
sign
that
does
not
--
doesn't
appear,
they
can
keep
it
there
and
it's
a
different
rule
entirely.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
being
talked
to
them
in
the
classroom
and
take
over
the
class
and
start
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
--
make
a
political
speech.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
in
the
hallways.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
in
the
hallways,
i'm
sure
they
can.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
no,
i'm
not
sure
that
it's
that
free
but
that
question
isn't
involved
here
and
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
--
that
rule
is
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
we
have
a
very
small
percentage
of
people
that
even
vote
now
on
that
campus.
they're
not
all
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
that's
correct.
my
time
is
up.
