mr.
james
b.
zagel
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
before
discussing
the
merits
on
the
legal
principles
involved,
i
would
like
to
clarify
two
or
three
--
the
factual
situations
involved
in
this
case.
the
arrest
occurred
as
counsel
of
the
petitioner
indicated,
because
two
police
officers
thought
that
the
petitioner
here
look
like
a
man
wanted
for
con
gang
(ph)
a
man
named
hampton
(ph).
two
police
officers
stopped
the
two
people,
petitioner
and
his
partner.
they
asked
petitioner
if
he
was
hampton
he
said
no,
he
was
not
hampton.
the
police
asked
if
he
had
any
identification,
when
the
petitioner
pulled
out
his
wallet
the
officer
noted
traveler’s
checks
in
the
petitioner’s
wallet
he
said
who
do
the
checks
belonged
to?
at
which
time
the
petitioner
said
“oh
that
is
play
money”
after
that
the
officers
said,
“let
me
see
them”
and
the
petitioner
handed
the
wallet
to
the
officer
who
looked
at
the
traveler’s
checks,
which
had
the
name
willie
shard
on
them
and
said,
“who
is
willie
shard?”
to
which
the
petitioner
responded,
“i
won
them
in
a
crap
game.”
the
appellate
court
of
illinois
upheld
that
initial
arrest
on
the
grounds
of
the
contradictory
explanations
for
the
possession
of
the
property,
plus
the
absence
of
any
identification
that
this
man
was
in
fact
willie
shard.
now
during
the
course
of
our
brief,
we
discussed
several
rules
of
application
for
united
states
versus
wade
and
when
i
refer
to
united
states
versus
wade,
i
of
course
include
gilbert
versus
california,
but
for
convenience
sake
referred
in
the
brief
and
will
refer
in
the
argument
to
wade.
we
point
out
that
there
is
one
exception
at
least
the
second
circuit
has
recognized
for
investigatory
show-ups
or
investigatory
confrontations,
when
that
argument
was
advanced
the
petitioners
replied
that
--
well
this
means
that
my
client
or
the
petitioner
was
arrested
on
grounds
of
suspicion
that
in
investigatory
--
the
stop
of
this
nature
was
not
based
on
probable
cause
and
if
that
position
had
been
taken
below,
then
this
case
will
not
be
hear
today.
i
have
to
differ
with
petitioner’s
counsel.
it
seems
to
me
that
hoffa
versus
united
states
in
385
us
definitely
rejected
the
proposition
that
investigatory
--
investigative
steps
cannot
be
set
to
occur
after
probable
cause
existed,
i
think
in
this
case
that
there
was
probable
cause.
and
that,
as
far
as
this
show-up
was
concerned
that
it
still
constituted
in
investigatory
show-up.
i
would
also
point
out,
with
respect
to
this
case,
we
raise
two
points:
the
first
is
that
we
do
defend,
despite
the
petitioner’s
assertion
to
the
contrary,
the
limitation
of
wade
to
post-indictment
cases,
that
is
point
one
of
our
brief.
we
also
attack
this
is
our
right
since
we
are
defending
a
judgment;
we
also
raise
the
broader
ground
of
the
overruling
in
wade.
i
would
address
myself
first
to
the
question
of
overruling.
i
would
also
point
out
that
when
we
ask
for
the
overruling
of
wade,
we
are
not
asking
for
the
overruling
of
stovall
v.
denno,
which
recognized
explicitly
a
due
process
right
under
the
due
process
clause
to
attack
unnecessarily
suggest
that
a
pre-trial
confrontations.
if
united
states
versus
wade
is
overruled
by
this
court,
it
does
not
put
out
of
the
reach
of
the
federal
courts
and
of
this
court,
questions
of
suggested
confrontations.
those
of
course,
can
still
be
reviewed
under
the
due
process
clause,
insofar
as
that
right
was
recognized
under
stovall
versus
denno.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes
more
precisely.
the
reason,
i
cite
wade
of
course,
is
that
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
it
was
the
first
case.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
and
if
united
states
versus
wade
is
the
right
to
counsels
to
be
continued
as
a
federal
requirement
under
supervisory
power
of
this
court
of
course,
had
no
standing--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes,
yes
it
was
but
it
incorporated
the
requirements
of
wade
and
ask
as
i
am
asking
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes
it
did,
your
honor.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes
it
did.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
no
i
do
not.
and
in
any
event,
it
would
be
--
i
am
not
--
position
of
the
state
of
illinois
asked
for
the
overruling
gideon’s
since
long
--
prior
to
gideon
--
illinois
provided
counsel
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes
and
of
course,
if
the
state
requires
that
i
would
not
be
in
the
position
to
ask.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well
i
would
--
it
is
at
that
point
mr.
justice
douglas
that
i
wish
to
address
myself,
but
direct
the
wade
case,
wade-gilbert
doctrine
adopted
right
to
counsel
at
lineups
under
a
critical
stage,
which
of
course
is
familiar,
at
least
the
language
is
familiar.
the
essential
basis
of
the
opinion
was
that
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
where
the
absence
of
counsel
might
affect
the
reliability
of
the
fact-finding
procedure.
that
is
a
critical
stage
and
the
right
to
counsel
attaches.
now,
our
first
submission
is
that
is
tightly
too
broad
a
standard,
because
the
presence
of
counsel,
at
least
if
you
assume
that
counsel’s
interest
is
in
a
fair
investigation
and
i
think
there
is
some
doubt
of
that.
but
even
if
you
assume
that
presence
of
counsel
reduces
a
danger
of
unreliable
evidence
at
every
stage,
in
which
evidence
is
gathered
and
all
of
the
well
recognized
exceptions
to
--
lower
court
exceptions
to
the
application
of
wade
would
come
under
this
reason.
the
prompt
identification
immediately
occurring
shortly
after
the
crime,
photographic
identification,
non-custodial
identification
procedures,
interviews
by
police
with
eye
witnesses,
appearance
of
witnesses
before
grand
juries.
all
of
these
cases
are
--
present
instances
in
which
the
presence
of
counsel
might
reduce
dangers
to
the
fact-finding
process
and
i
think
that
counsel
for
the
petitioner
is
quite
correct
in
its
reluctance
to
state
that
he
would
not
contend
that
the
right
to
counsel
attaches
to
these
points.
he
does
not
wish
to
reach
these
issues,
because
frankly
under
the
critical
stage
reasoning
of
wade
he
would
have
to
concede
that
the
right
to
counsel
attaches
at
all
of
these
points.
yet,
nearly
every
court
that
has
ruled
on
these
questions
has
held
no,
there
is
no
right
to
counsel.
further
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
non
custodial
identification
cases,
which
where
thehypothetical
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes
and
the
one
california
case,
which
holds
that
there
is
a
right
to
have
a
counsel
present
when
the
police
interview
eye
witnesses.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
supreme
court
of
california,
very
narrow
holding.
it
was
a
holding
in
which
the
lineup
was
conducted
with
the
presence
of
counsel;
the
witnesses
then
left
the
lineup
room
to
state
their
impressions
for
the
lineup.
counsel
asked
could
he
go
along
at
that
the
time
and
the
police
said,
“no
you
cannot,”
and
the
california
supreme
court
said,
“well,
since
counsel
was
there
and
it
would
not
have
caused
any
disruption
or
any
inconvenience
counsel
can
sit
there
while
the
police
ask
witnesses
the
question.”
however
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
a
court
i
believe
remanded
the
cause.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
it
was
based
on
the
united
states
constitution.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
in
my
opinion
for
purposes
of
right
to
counsel,
eye
witness
identification
never
presents
a
critical
stage.
i
think
that
the
right
to
counsel
at
a
lineup
is
an
inappropriate
right
and
that
is
why
i
am
asking
for
the
overruling
of
--
there
is
a
secondary
position
i
take
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
think
kirby
was
entitled
to
counsel
under
the
coleman
versus
alabama
at
that
time
of
this
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
do
not
know
how
many
days
later
it
was,
but
it
was
after
the
identification.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
think
he
was
charged
with
robbery
after
the
identification
by
shard.
i
do
not
think
there
was
a
formal
charge
entered
and
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
think
they
were
holding
him,
because
they
had
probable
cause
to
believe
he
had
stolen
the
traveler’s
checks,
but
of
course
they
did
not
know
until
shard
made
the
identification
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
we
do
know
why
mr.
justice
marshall
we
know
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
that
--
well,
we
know
that
he
had
traveler’s
checks
in
a
name
which
he
did
not
prove
to
be
his
own
and
we
know
that
he
gave
two
totally
inconsistent
explanations
for
his
possession
of
those
checks.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
i
think
it
gives
probable
cause
to
believe
that
he
may
have
stolen
those
checks.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes,
but
you
do
not
have
to
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
no
it
is
probable
cause
to
believe
that
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well
in
the
sense,
yes
of
course
you
do
not
have
to
establish
guilty
under
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
think
that
he
would
probably
have
been
released,
although
unless
he
could
show
that
he
was
willie
shard
and
the
traveler’s
checks
were
his,
the
police
might
keep
the
traveler’s
checks.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
that
seems
to
be
a
police
practice,
i
do
not
--
when
a
man
cannot
prove
the
property
is
his
and
especially
when
he
gives
conflicting
explanations.
and,
his
responses
were
rather
incredible,
his
first
response
was,
“oh,
it
is
play
money.”
and,
the
second
response,
“i
won
in
a
crap
game.”
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
do
not
think
he
was
charged
at
all
--
so
i
do
not
think
he
is
charged
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
would
assume
that
he
was
arrested.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that?
mr.
james
b.
zagel
no,
although
i
think
you
can
make
reasonable
assumptions
based
on
facts
in
the
records.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes
he
was
under
arrest.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well
except
my
point
is
that
i
do
not
think
you
can
draw
distinction
based
on
the
fact
that
the
man
is
under
arrest.
if
it
is
possible
--
if
identifying
a
man
who
is
under
arrest
in
a
single
show-up
standing
with
two
police
officers
standing
on
either
side
of
them
is
critical,
has
potentiality
for
suggestiveness,
which
requires
the
right
to
counsel.
it
is
no
different
if
it
occurs
shortly
after
the
crime.
it
is
no
different
--
the
same
potential
for
suggestion
exists.
the
same
potential
for
suggestion
exists
when
a
man
who
was
not
in
custody,
say
a
man
is
working
at
gas
station
and
the
police
suspect
him
of
the
crime
and
bring
a
couple
of
witnesses
by
and
point
him
out.
now,
i
am
not
saying
that
the
court
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
in
a
sense,
they
did
not
know
that
willie
shard
had
been
robbed,
but
it
would
be
a
very
dense
police
officer
who
faced
with
these
two
conflicting
explanations
plus
the
lack
of
any
identification
of
the
person
in
possession
of
the
check
is
willie
shard,
that
would
be
a
very
dense
police
officer
who
would
not
have
a
pretty
good
reason,
at
least
legally
sufficient
reason
to
suspect
that
this
man
had
stolen
that
property
or
at
least
was
in
the
possession
of
stolen
property.
now,
i
do
not
know
perhaps
if
only
one
of
the
explanations
had
been
given,
although
the
play
money
one
seems
incredible.
that
there
maybe
the
officer
might
not
have
had
probable
cause.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
he
has
not
challenge
the
arrest
here.
now,
i
point
also
that
in
wade,
the
court
was
concerned
with
the
potential
for
deliberate
police
suggestion,
deliberate
police
misconduct,
but
yet
the
court
in
wade
said
that
we
are
not
going
the
hold
at
the
taking
of
a
blood
test
or
the
taking
of
a
hand
writing
exemplars
is
a
critical
stage.
i
would
point
out
that
this
almost,
although
not
quite
the
same,
potential
for
abuse
in
those
cases
are
requiring
the
presence
of
counsels
as
there
is
in
the
eye
witness
identification
case.
at
least,
theoretically
possible
that
the
police
--
if
they
were
malicious
might
use
improper
methods
of
taking
blood
or
they
might
just
say
that
the
blood
taken
from
the
--
that
they
justified
was
taken
the
defendant,
it
was
never
taken
from
the
defendant
and
counsel
of
course
had
he
witnessed,
the
taking
of
blood
that
would
be
in
a
position
to
ensure
the
reliability,
the
fact
finding
procedure.
the
final
point
made
i
think
with
respect
to
the
rationale
within
wade
is
that
the
petitioner
in
a
lineup
--
when
he
challenges
the
lineup,
has
a
terrible
problem
reconstructing
what
occurred.
now,
i
do
not
know
that
the
problem
exists,
for
example,
there
did
not
seem
to
be
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
in
reconstructing
what
occurred
in
wade
or
what
occurred
in
gilbert
or
what
occurred
in
stovall,
there
does
not
seem
to
have
been
--
all
others
minor
disagreement
does
not
seem
to
have
been
much
difficulty
reconstructing
what
occurred
in
this
case.
and
furthermore,
that
problem
of
reconstruction
exists
in
every
one
of
the
accepted
cases
under
wade.
the
same
problem
of
reconstruction
of
prompt
identification,
the
same
problem
of
reconstruction
photographic
identification,
all
exists.
the
theory,
the
critical
stage
theory
of
wade,
i
submit
is
without
rational
limitations.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
no
i
do
not
suggest.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
i
would
--
as
i
recall
schmerber,
i
am
not
incidentally
suggesting
that
this
court
overrule
that
aspect
of
gilbert
and
schmerber
that
dealt
with
the
fifth
amendment.
i
am
dealing
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
no
i
am
dealing
solely
with
those
portions
of
the
case
dealt
with
the
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
sixth.
the
more
important
and
i
think
it
is
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes,
we
have
considered
that,
we
have
considered
that
--
we
consider
that
expressly
in
the
brief
and
our
concern
with
that
point
is,
is
that
you
have
a
difficult
problem,
if
you
assume
that
--
if
either
assumption
is
taken
and
the
fact
that
counsel
is
present
and
he
does
not
effectuate
a
fair
lineup
of
counsels
present
and
he
does.
if
he
does
not
effectuate
a
fair
lineup,
he
is
in
a
position
where
he
must
testify
as
a
witness,
which
may
disqualify
him
from
representing
the
defendant,
his
counsel.
furthermore,
as
professor
reed
(ph),
points
out
in
his
article,
there
really
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
attorney,
on
behalf
of
the
defendant
is
likely
to
be
viewed
as
anymore
impartial,
when
he
testifies
then
the
defendant
himself
is.
so,
i
think
that
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
that
is
the
alternative,
which
is
to
say
that
is
the
remedy
is
affected.
the
problem
with
that
is
you
may
still
have
to
testify,
not
as
the
defendant's
witness,
but
the
prosecutions.
because
what
he
sees
at
that
lineup
is
not
privilege,
it
does
not
involve
communications
from
his
client.
he
may
be
called
by
the
prosecution.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
that
brings
the
next
point.
if
he
is
successful
and
he
either
has
to
testify
against
this
client
or
he
says
to
his
client.
no,
i
am
not
going
to
challenge
the
identification,
no;
i
am
not
going
to
cross
examine
these
witnesses,
because
i
was
there
and
it
was
a
fair
lineup.
you
create
a
serious
breach
in
his
relationship
with
his
client,
not
only
that
you
are
undoubtedly
going
to
the
subject
to
attacks
for
being
unfaithful
to
this
client.
that
the
client
is
going
to
say
when
the
lawyer
says
“no,
we
are
not
going
to
take
this
lineup.”
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
i
do
not
know
that
is
a
fair
assumption.
i
tend
to
think
that
if
mr.
kirby’s
counsel-
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
i
would
ask
you
to
make
a
different
assumption,
i
would
ask
you
to
assumed
that
if
mr.
kirby
had
counsel
and
mr.
kirby’s
counsel
ensured
that
there
was
a
fair
line
up
although
that
is
not
his
job
to
ensure
that
this
is
a
fair
lineup.
it
is
his
job
to
ensure
that
there
is
a
lineup
weighted
in
favor
of
this
client.
assume
that
he
succeeded
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
i
think
that
maybe
mr.
justice
marshall
let
us
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
very
much
disagree
with
that
role
of
defense
counsel.
i
was
defense
counsel
myself
and
my
role
is
to
see
within
the
law
that
i
can
get,
if
i
can
get
an
acquittal
from
my
client
and
it
is
not
in
my
interest,
if
i
am
representing
a
guilty
client
to
see
that
there
is
a
perfectly
fair
lineup.
in
fact,
if
i
were
a
defense
counsel
i
find
it
difficult
to
make
a
decision
whether
to
object
to
an
unfair
lineup.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
no.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
no,
i
do
not.
but,
there
is
a
difference
standard
of
doing
on
prosecutors
than
there
is
in
defense
counsel.
there
is
no
equivalent
to
brady
and
maryland
for
defense
counsel.
but,
it
is
an
obligation
that
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
except
the
cannons,
which
are
unenforcible
and
i
do
not
that
the
cannons,
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
but
if
the
counsel
succeeds
by
his
presence
in
securing
a
fair
identification.
he
is
going
to
have
difficulties
with
his
client,
because
he
is
in
--
he
is
not--he
is
supposed
to
defend
his
client’s
interest,
and
he
is
supposed
to
advocate
his
client
cause.
he
is
not
supposed
to
be
a
witness.
he
is
not
supposed
to
assume
the
role
of
an
impartial
witness.
it
is
not
a
mere
technicality
that
the
cannon
say
that
a
man
should
not
both
lawyer
and
witness,
it
is
the
very
sound
reason
and
the
sound
reason
is
as
witness
his
testimony
may
damage
his
client’s
case.
and
that
is
why
i
think
counsel
is
particularly
inappropriate
vehicle
with
the
regulation
of
lineup
procedures.
we
point
out
that
the
regulation
of
lineups
can
be
accomplished
under
the
due
process
clause
under
stovall.
if
it
is
thought
that
there
is
a
sufficient
danger
of
improper
identification
procedures,
but
counsel
is
not
the
appropriate
technique
to
use.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
would
you
repeat
your
question
(voice
overlap)
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes,
that
is
true,
the
prosecutor
might
not
call,
but
the
risk
exists.
and
that
risk
might
influence
defense
counsel’s
tactics.
defense
it
may
be
very
well
be
that
a
defense
counsel
will
be
present
at
a
line,
he
will
think
that
the
lineup
is
fair,
it
will
tell
his
client,
“no,
i
am
not
going
to
raise
any
question,
as
the
lineup,”
and
the
trial
will
go
on
smooth
and
calm
and
nothing
will
happen
except
later
in
the
state
or
federal
proceeding
the
defendant
is
going
to
say
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
ineffective
assistant
of
counsel,
or
to
put
it
in
a
vernacular
of
a
client,
as
he
once
addressed
it
to
me
one,
i
said
i
was
not
going
to
raise
a
search
and
seizure,
the
question
is,
he
said,
who’s
side
you
are?
and
that
is
not
going
to
benefit
the
administration
of
criminal
justice.
i
might
also
add
that
this
has
to
be
viewed
in
context
of
the
fact,
that
there
is
very
little
in
a
way
of
legal
resources,
that
is
to
say
lawyers
who
meet
the
problem
of
counsel
at
lineups.
in
fact,
in
one
case,
randolph
(ph)
care
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
the
district
of
colombia,
which
has
a
provision,
legal
aid
agency
apparently
provides
counsel.
counsel
was
called
to
testify
at
a
motion
to
suppress.
at
his
testimony,
he
could
not
remember
whether
he
represented
the
defendant
randolph,
he
came
back
the
next
day
and
said
well,
he
had
thought
it
over
very
carefully
and
he
had
a
vague
recollection
that
he
represented
randolph.
and,
then
they
said,
“what
happened?
he
said,
“well,
i
will
have
to
look
at
my
notes,”.
in
effect
what
counsel
did
is
he
testified
from
his
notes.
now,
i
do
not
know
why
his
notes
are
going
to
be
better
than
a
photograph
of
a
lineup.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
think
it
is
a
practical
way
of
assuring
all
of
the
fairness
that
the
presence
of
counsel
is
supposed
to
assure.
there
are
some
questions
of
fairness
that
admittedly
not
even
counsel
can
assure.
for
example,
before
the
lineup,
the
police
can
say
to
a
man,
to
the
witness,
the
man
who
is
the
3rd
one
from
the
left,
we
found
his
stolen
property,
your
stolen
property
in
his
house
and
he
has
got
a
record
that
as
long
as
your
armed
and
he
has
done
it
many
times
and
several
people
who
saw
him
come
out
of
your
house
have
identified
him.
now,
that
clearly
suggest
the
practice,
but
that
is
not
something
that
is
reached
under
the
right
to
counsel
in
any
event
that
is
reached
under
the
due
process
aspect.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
no,
it
is
not.
there
was
language
in
the
opinion
in
wade
that
suggested
that
perhaps
administrative
regulations
would
all
be
the
necessity
for
counsel.
the
problem
with
that
language
and
problem
with
asking
the
state
to
rely
on
that
language
is
that
three
of
the
justices,
who
concurred
with
the
majority
opinion
explicitly,
rejected
that.
the
fourth
justice,
who
concurred,
said
nothing
on
the
point,
and
so
far
as
i
know
the
only
case
which
is
dealt
with
administrator
regulations
is
to
file
of
(ph)
case
in
supreme
court
in
california,
where
they
just
simply
said
that
the
regulations
would
have
to
be
so
strong
as
to
ensure
that
there
no
suggestive
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes,
but
there
is
an
existing
regulation,
which
existed
before
the
time
of
wade,
gilbert
or
stovall,
which
prescribed
certain
procedures
for
lineups,
strangely
enough
defense
counsel
have
not
used
it.
i
do
not
know
why
they
have
not,
they
never
called
the
police
in
and
used
the
regulations
in
cross
examining
police
officers
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
no,
no
there
was
a
prior
to
the
time
of
the
palmer
decision,
there
were
some
draft
regulations
concerning
right
to
counsel
and
many
police
officers
of
course,
were
aware
of
the
decision
and
there
are
fair
number
of
cases
involving
warnings
to
the
right
to
counsel
and
even
a
few
in
which
counsel
was
present
in
the
lineup,
but
there
have
been
no
formal
regulations,
promulgated
as
a
result
of
those
decisions.
i
point
out
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes,
but
i
would
submit
that
it
would
be
difficult
for
me,
for
example,
advising
a
police
to
say
that,
that
aspect
of
the
opinion
was
the
holding
the
court.
so
far
as
i
can
understand
--
so,
far
as
i
could
infer
mr.
justice
brennan,
you
were
the
only
justice
in
the
court
who
definitely
a
committed
himself
to
that
proposition.
although,
perhaps
mr.
justice
clark
did,
as
well.
but
three
of
those
who
were
to
join
with
you
in
the
opinion
did
not
adhere
to
that.
that
is
why
if
it
had
been
a
little
more
clear
cut
perhaps
we
might
be
arguing
a
different
issue
today
and
that
i
think
is
responsible
for
the
reluctance
the
california
supreme
court
to
prove
the
regulations
in
the
fowler
case.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
no,
i
think
that
it
was
investigatory
in
the
sense
that
i
think
if
shard
had
said,
“no,
that
is
not
the
man,”
they
would
have
been
released.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
think
it
was
investigatory
in
nature.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
think
that
is
an
additional
reason
for
taking
out
of
wade
and
gilbert,
if
wade
and
gilbert
is
the
stand.
in
conclusion,
i
simply
state
that
as
far
as
wade
is
concerned,
and
gilbert
involves
the
insertion
of
counsel
and
to
a
role
in
which
he
has
needed
the
capacity,
authority
or
ethical
obligation
to
fulfill
and
fulfill
adequately
and
that
insertion
counsel
in
to
that
situation
ought
to
end
and
wade
and
gilbert
to
the
extent
that
they
required
ought
to
be
overruled.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
here
today
to
ask
for
the
overruling
of
the
united
states
versus
wade
and
gilbert
versus
california,
insofar
as
they
established
a
right
to
counsel
at
lineups.
it
should
be
made
clear
that
we
do
not
ask
for
the
overruling
of
stovall
versus
denno.
insofar
as
it
established
or
affirmed
a
due
process
right
of
an
accused
to
have
a
fair
or
non-suggested
lineup.
we
do
not
propose
therefore
that
a
person
agreed
by
an
unnecessarily
suggested
lineup
should
be
deprived
of
law,
state
and
federal
remittance.
with
respect
to
the
petitioner's
oral
argument,
there
are
at
least
four
or
five
points
that
i
would
like
to
clarify,
if
i
may
briefly.
petitioner
in
his
oral
argument
has
claimed
that
this
particular
case
can
be
resolved
on
stovall
grounds,
he
assumes
without
any
basis
that
we
concede
this.
in
fact,
point
one
of
the
certiorari
petition
directly
raised
the
stovall's
point
and
that
point
of
the
certiorari
petition
was
not
taken
by
this
court.
the
stovall
issue
was
decided
in
the
appellate
court
below.
it
is
available
on
habeas
corpus.
if
the
petitioner
should
fail
in
this
court
but
it
is
not
available,
i
think,
to
be
raised
here
and
now.
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
the
appendix,
you
will
note
that
the
motion
is
suppressed
the
trial.
the
only
issue
abstract
is
the
issue
of
denial
of
counsel.
the
only
testimony
abstracted
is
the
statements
of
bean
and
kerby
that
they
were
not
advised
the
right
to
counsel.
the
other
point
with
respect
to
stovall
is
that
the
witness
shard
was
not
told
of
the
fact
that
traveler's
checks
had
been
recovered
from
bean
and
kerby.
the
appendix
page
27
makes
it
quite
clear.
it
is
also
quite
clear
from
the
record
of
appendix
31
and
36
that
the
identification
by
shard
was
instantaneous
and
that
at
the
time,
shard
was
brought
to
the
police
station,
he
was
accompanied
by
an
officer
who
knew
nothing
of
the
facts
of
the
case,
had
not
seen
the
suspects
and
did
not
know
who
was
suspect.
the
last
point
that
i
want
to
make
generally
with
respect
to
petitioner's
argument
on
the
eyewitness
identification
generally
is,
the
petitioners
argue
that
the
eyewitness
identification,
the
testimony
in
court
is
perhaps
the
most
potent
of
all
evidence.
they
said,
at
least
there
is
some
element
of
irony
in
that
argument
when
this
case
was
initially
argued,
was
argued
on
november
11th
and
it
was
immediately
preceded
by
argument
in
another
illinois
case,
lega
versus
tumi
(ph),
which
involved
the
burden
of
proof
volunteering
this
little
confession.
i
can
clearly
recall,
petitioner's
counsel
in
that
case
pointing
out
that
confessions
were
by
far
the
most
potent
evidence
far
off
distancing
eyewitness
identification
and
therefore
subject
to
increasing
safeguards.
in
fact,
petitioner's
argument
that
the
trial
identification
is
so
crucial
and
so
inherently
suggestive,
is
essentially
an
argument
that
there's
a
constitutional
right
that
would
lineup
in
the
court
room.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
constitutional
right
to
have
a
counsel
at
a
pre-trial
confrontation.
petitioner
also
assumes,
and
i
really
assume
as
perhaps
too
weak
a
word
i
would
say,
(inaudible)
for
a
supposed
concession
by
the
respondent
that
the
arrest
in
this
case
was
illegal.
again,
i
want
to
point
out
that
this
issue,
the
legality
of
the
arrest
was
raised
again
at
point
3
of
the
certiorari
petition,
that
was
not
taken
by
this
court.
i
would
also
point
that
there
seems
to
be
a
fundamental
misconception
in
petitioner's
reasoning
with
respect
to
this
issue
and
that
is,
he
assumes
that
as
soon
as
we
say
that
a
confrontation
was
investigatory
in
nature
that
represents
a
concession
that
probable
clause
did
not
exist.
now,
this
dichotomy
that
as
soon
as
probable
clause
exists,
investigation
must
stop
or
procedures
can
no
longer
be
classified
as
investigative
in
nature.
that
was
raised
once
before
and
explicitly
rejected
by
this
court
in
hoffa
versus
united
states,
385
u.s.,
page
309-310,
in
which
the
court
clearly
held
that
there
was
no
duty
to
call
a
halt
to
investigation.
the
moment
that
the
police
have
probable
cause,
a
quantum
of
evidence
which
may
fall
far
short
of
that
necessary
to
convict.
finally
as
one
clarifying,
and
the
ast
clarifying
point
with
respect
to
the
reversal
of
the
conviction
of
the
code
offended
bean,
the
reason
that
there
was
an
absolute
reversal
in
that
case
was
because
since
the
arrest
of
bean
was
thought
to
be
illegal
and
it
should
be
clear
that
bean
was
not
in
possession
of
shard's
traveler's
checks
and
did
not
give
the
patently
false
and
contradictory
explanations
of
how
he
came
into
possession
of
those
traveler's
checks.
since,
bean's
arrest
being
substantially
different
from
kirby's,
since
that
arrest
was
declared
illegal,
not
only
was
the
resulting
identification
suppressed
by
the
appellate
court
but
so
too
was
that
evidence
of
shard's
cards
and
identification
materials
which
was
found
on
bean's
purse
subsequent
to
the
arrest.
in
effect,
all
of
the
evidence,
both
physical
evidence
and
identification
evidence,
was
suppressed
in
bean's
case
and
that
is
substantially
different
from
the
case
before
the
court.
that
seems
to
me
that
petitioner
seeks
to
avoid
the
issue
in
this
case
which
is
whether
the
admission
of
evidence
of
the
pre-trial
confrontation
without
counsel
violated
the
per
se
exclusion
rule
of
wade
gilbert,
indeed
his
oral
argument
thus
far
has
been
devoid
of
any
defense
of
the
wade-gilbert
doctrine.
i
am
concerned
with
the
right
to
counsel
at
lineups,
the
wade-gilbert
doctrine
is
too
prong.
first
we
think
that
the
theoretical
underpinning
is
unsound.
wade
and
gilbert
had,
that
a
lineup
a
critical
stage
requiring
counsel
because
the
presence
of
counsel
might
serve
to
enhance
the
reliability
of
the
lineup
procedure.
the
concept
of
counsel
as
a
surety
for
reliable
investigation
of
crime
represented
a
shift
in
the
critical
stage
rational
previously
used
by
this
court.
this
reliable
investigation
theory,
i
think
carries
too
far,
if
it
is
applied
seriously,
it
would
require
the
presence
of
counsel
at
every
stage
of
an
investigation.
in
our
brief
we
discussed
several
common
instances
in
which
the
courts
have
routinely
refused
to
apply,
right
to
counsel,
among
these
are
non-custodial
confrontations,
viewing
of
photographs
of
suspects,
confrontations
occurring
shortly
after
the
crime.
it
seems
to
me
that
counsel
can
be
as
useful
in
these
cases
as
it
can
that
the
lineups
involved
in
wade
and
gilbert,
in
one
area
of
particular
interest,
that
to
which,
i
think,
the
amicus
curiae
will
also
go
is
that
of
the
argument
that
counsel
ought
to
be
present
when
the
police
interview
eyewitnesses.
frankly,
if
wade
and
gilbert's
premises
are
accepted
it
seems
to
me
a
persuasive
argument
because
that
is
the
time
when
police
presumably
can
engage
and
suggest
the
practices
which
were
definitely
a
concern
of
instant
need,
the
lineup
cases.
that
is
the
time
when
suggestions
and
other
evidence
can
be
planted
in
the
witnesses'
mind
and
indeed
one
court,
the
california
court,
the
supreme
court
has
decided
that
in
fact,
counsel
has
to
be
present
at
interviews
of
eyewitnesses.
now,
i
think
that
under
wade's
rationale,
the
right
to
counsel
probably
could
be
extended
to
grand
jury
proceedings
and
even
frankly
to
scientific
tests.
now,
it
is
true,
for
example,
that
in
wade
and
gilbert,
scientific
testing
was
accepted.
the
court
said,
we
are
not
going
to
insist
on
the
right
to
counsel
to
be
present
when
scientific
testing
of
the
evidence
goes
on.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
the
court
against
the
concern
in
the
lineup
cases
with
deliberate
suggestion
on
the
part
of
the
police,
a
deliberate
suggestion
that
amounts
to
tampering
with
evidence
and
that
possibility
exists
in
scientific
testing
as
well.
now,
we
have
made
this
argument,
frankly.
our
core
that
the
rationale,
at
great
length
in
our
brief
and
i
have
no
wish
to
deliver
it
here
since
we
would
not
ask
this
court
to
overrule
the
decision
merely
because
its
rationale
seems
unpersuasive.
our
principal
objection,
is
that
promulgating
a
right
to
counsel
at
lineups,
is
singularly
inappropriate
as
the
solution
to
lineup
problems.
so
as
far
as
we
have
been
able
to
discovering
the
reported
decisions,
the
purpose
of
counsel
at
a
lineup
is
to
act
as
a
witness,
and
by
his
presence
to
deter
unfairness.
the
problems
with
his
functioning,
in
this
manner
are
manifest.
but
the
one
point
that
i
ought
to
make
clear
is,
it's
seem
to
me
obvious,
that
no
other
function
can
be
served
by
counsel
at
a
lineup
other
than
that
of
witness.
he
cannot
of
course
be
placed
in-charge
of
the
lineup,
under
the
decisions
in
wade
and
gilbert,
he
cannot
prevent
the
line
up
and
that
this
incidentally
is
a
significant
difference
between
lineup
problems
and
those
involving
interrogation
where
defense
counsel
can
effectively
prevent
the
police
from
interrogation.
he
cannot
prevent
the
lineup.
his
sole
purpose
is,
that
as
a
witness
indeed,
i
doubt
that
interest
of
counsel
is
such
that
he
would
want
to
promote
a
fair
lineup.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
purpose
of
counsel,
is
to
secure
a
lineup
that
is
unfair,
as
unfair
as
possible,
in
favor
of
his
own
client.
his
suggestions
that
he
gives
to
the
police,
need
not
be
accepted.
the
police
of
course
can,
i
think
have
just
concerns
to
whether
counsel
is
interested
in
fairness,
or
interested
in
protecting
his
client,
and
i
think
a
reasonable
police
officer
could
conclude
that
the
primary
purpose
of
counsel
suggestions
is
not
to
secure
fairness,
but
to
secure
some
advantage
for
his
client.
and
of
course,
counsel
is
in
a
terribly
difficult
tactical
position.
if
his
client
is
guilty,
and
i
think
it
can
be
fairly
stated
that
this
is
the
case
in
most
situations,
he
will
be
slow
to
attempt
to
if
he
sees
for
example,
deficiencies
in
the
line
up.
he
is
going
to
be
slow
to
attempt
to
clean
this
up.
i
don't
think
counsel
wants
to
validate
the
police
lineup
that
maybe
his
only
point,
his
only
legal
recourse
to
try.
and
so
far
as
we
are
aware
there
is
no
contemporaneous
objection
with
respect
to
what
counsel
has
to
do
with
lineup.
we
know
of
no
court
that
has
required
counsel,
police
present
at
the
lineup
to
make
objections
to
the
lineup,
at
the
time
of
the
lineup,
or
forever
waive
his
objections.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
law
is
clear
that
even
if
counsel
is
at
the
lineup,
he
can
raise
objections
to
its
fairness
at
trial.
so
it
is
really
very
much,
not
in
the
interest
of
counsel
to
make
objections,
to
make
suggestions.
first
of
all,
or
rather
next
with
respect
to
its
effectiveness
as
a
witnesses,
it
was
thought
i
think
in
the
opinion
that
counsel
would
be
particularly
effective
and
his
client
would
not
be
particularly
effective
as
a
witness.
i
think
perhaps,
it
is
a
somewhat
of
a
misjudgment.
i
do
not
think
that
counsel
for
a
party
will
be
regarded
by
a
jury,
or
by
a
court
as
essentially
more
neutral,
than
his
client.
he
is
not
necessarily
an
expert
in
lineup
procedure,
in
what
is
fair
and
what
is
not
fair
in
a
lineup.
since
all
he
does,
his
witness
to
lineup
itself,
he
will
not
have
the
occasion
for
example,
to
witness
outside
influence.
he
will
not
for
example,
if
he
want
to
assume
a
horrible
case,
counsel
may
be
present
at
the
lineup,
as
the
police
lead
the
witness
in.
the
policeman
might
say
before
the
witness
where
he
gets
into
the
lineup
room.
that
the
man
we
think
did
it,
or
the
man
on
whom
stolen
property
was
found,
is
the
man
standing
second
from
the
left.
now,
counsel
will
not
witness
that,
and
that
kind
of
suggestion
can
be
brought
out
only
in
cross
examination.
and
i
assume
that
cross
examination
will
be
effective
indeed,
it
was
not
difficult
for
counsel
in
wade,
or
counsel
in
gilbert,
or
counsel
in
stovall,
to
recreate
the
circumstances
of
the
lineup.
even
though
counsel
in
none
of
those
cases
was
present
at
lineup.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
it
is
not
required
in
illinois
to
take
photographs
of
lineups.
it
is
a
practice
of
varying
prevalence.
there
are
photographs
of
some
lineups,
there
are
not
photographs
of
others.
i
have
never
been
able
to
determine
a
live
photographs
taken
in
particular
cases
or
not
in
others.
it's
been
my
experience
in
the
lineups
where
at
a
central
police
headquarters
or
when
lineups
were
conducted
in
a
more
deliberate
fashion,
that
photographs
have
been
taken.
i
would
be
extremely
surprised
if
a
routine
station
has
line
up
led
to
a
photograph.
although,
i
understand
that
there
were
some
regulations
under
consideration.
i
really
cannot
speak
with
authority
and
there
are
not
a
large
number
of
cases
involving
photographs
of
lineups
in
illinois.
it
is
our
contention
of
course
that
---
mr.
james
b.
zagel
no,
it
was
not
a
lineup,
it
was
a
show
up.
and
i
again
reiterate
in
this
case,
particularly
as
an
illustration
that
a
counsel
for
kirby
seemed
to
have
no
difficulty
in
reconstructing
the
circumstances
of
this
particular
show
up.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
i
don't
think
that,
that
would
have
had
any
bearing
whatsoever
in
the
lineup.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
am
certain
he
could
have,
i
am
certain
he
could
have,
i
don't
know
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
he
probably
could
have
said
that,
but
i
very
much
doubt
that
that
would
have
been
affected
but
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
police
could
have
arrested
in
fact,
i
think
probably
did
arrest
and
probably
could
have
charged.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
think
it's
clear
that
they
were
under
arrest,
they
had
not
been
formally
charged.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
think
that
they
were
properly
arrested
under
illinois
law
exercising
unauthorized
control
of
the
property.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
might,
i
think
it
is
my
contention
that
investigation
and
investigatory
steps
are
not
inconsistent
with
the
post-arrest
precedence.
in
this
case,
you
had
a
valid
arrest
for
exercising
unauthorized
control
over
the
property
of
another.
you
had
an
investigatory
proceeding
with
respect
to
whether
they
should
be
charged
with
robbery.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
don't
know,
it's
not
clear
in
the
record.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
i
would
suggest
that
those
problems
and
i
don't
mean
to
minimize,
are
not
particularly
relevant
to
the
issues
before
the
court.
i
think
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
--
now
the
question
of
the
lineup
and
of
counsel's
role
at
the
lineup
and
i
think
they
also
again
that
they
will
not
take
advice
for.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
think
that,
i
would
not
contend
that
that
is
the
case,
that
police
can
do
that
but
i
would
say
that,
that
is
not
the
case
here.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
think
they
brought
the
petitioner
back
to
the
police
station,
i
don't
know
if
they
called
shard,
they
might
have
just
gone
through,
there
is
a
way
you
can
call
the
central
files
and
find
out
if
a
crime
has
been
reported,
the
traveler's
checks
had
been
stolen
and
that
is
what
they
did
in
this
case
i
think.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes,
i
think
that
they
--
i
think
what
they
had
at
that
time
was
the
basis
for
arresting
for
what
an
illinois
is
called
exercising
and
unauthorized
control
over
the
property.
well,
now
that
the
reason
they
had
that
the
basis
was
because
they
had,
in
this
case,
in
somewhat
unusual
clearly
identifiable
property.
it
had
an
owner
whose
name
was
willie
shard
and
he
was
in
the
possession
of
a
man
named
kirby
and
the
man
named
kirby
had
given
two
conflicting
explanations
as
to
how
he
had
come
in
to
possession
of
the
property.
i
tend
to
think
that
might
possibly
be
sufficient
evidence
to
convict
for
exercising
unauthorized
control
over
the
property
over
in
illinois.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
oh
no,
it
wasn't
a
very
long
time,
at
least
perhaps
and
i
think
maybe
an
hour
or
two
before
they
knew
that
the
property
had
been
stolen
from
shard
but
of
course,
they
still
didn't
know
that
this
man
had
committed
the
robbery.
even
so
they
would
still
only
have
the
basis
to
believe
that
they
were
exercising
unauthorized
control
over
the
property
of
(inaudible).
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
i
think
it
is.
if
all
it
were,
were
ineffective
i
suppose
it
could
survive.
there
are
two
problems
that
i
have,
two
general
areas
of
concern.
the
first
is
of
course,
it
does
present
a
severe
strain
on
legal
resources,
if
you
pick
counsel
for
this
you
could
deprive
other
people
of
these
legal
resources
that
maybe
the
minor
point.
the
more
significant
one
is
that
the
study
in
the
district
of
columbia
which
was
done
by
professor
reid
in
the
ucla
law
review,
indicated
that
there
were
incidents
of
intimidation
of
witnesses,
there
were
incidents
of
deliberate
altering
of
the
suspect's
appearance.
once
counsel
had
entered
the
case,
and
more
significantly,
if
counsel
for
example,
does
attend
the
lineup,
that
is
perfectly
fair.
he
is
going
to
be
in
a
very
difficult
position
of
being
subject
to
being
called
as
a
witness,
and
not
on
his
own
behalf
or
not
on
his
client's
behalf
but
on
behalf
of
the
prosecution.
what
he
sees
that
the
lineup
is
not
privileged,
fairly
strong
line
of
cases
which
are
cited
in
our
brief
on
that
point.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
there
is
no
evidence
on
that.
there
are
two
things
i
can
say
and
that
the
first
is
that
since
the
illinois
supreme
court
has
given
a
relatively
narrow
interpretation
for
the
applicability
of
wade
and
gilbert
that
is
to
say
is
to
find
the
post
indictment,
the
confrontations.
i
doubt
that
there
ever
would
be
any
great
evidences
to
their
particular
effect.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
that
ground
is
argued,
they
are
fully
in
our
brief.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
and
we
stand
on
that
as
well.
stand
on
that
as
well.
it
is
i
think
a
very
interesting
example
of
what
happens
when
counsel
do
attempt
or
the
bar
attempts
to
fulfill
the
mandate
of
wade
and
gilbert,
is
illustrated
of
course
in
professor
reid's
article
in
which
at
least
from
his
interviews
with
defense
counsel,
we
found
that
they
felt
kind
of
impotent
and
useless
at
the
lineups.
i
think
what's
even
more
significant
is
that
the
kind
of
an
odd
case,
united
states
versus
randolph
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
which
a
legal
aid
attorney
was
called
to
testify
on
his
client's
behalf,
and
he
was
the
man
who
was
assigned
to
the
police
station
to
be
present
at
the
time
that
these
lineups
occured.
and
not
only
could
he
not
remember
the
circumstances
of
the
lineup,
he
had
to
go
back
to
his
notes
to
determine
whether
he
had
represented
randolph
and
return
the
next
day
and
said
that
he'd
represented
randolph
and
then
testified
essentially
from
his
notes.
i
think
that
that
would
be
the
general
experience
in
any
jurisdiction
which
is
attempted
to
comply
with
wade
and
gilbert.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
that
was
a
pre-indictment
lineup.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes,
after
indictment,
defendant,
now
today,
i
suppose
after
preliminary
hearing,
a
defendant
would
have
an
individual
lawyer,
one
of
the
significant
differences
between
the
ordinary
case
such
as
this
one
and
the
post
indictment
or
post
preliminary
hearing
lineup.
so
usually
at
that
stage,
the
later
stage,
you
have
counsel
who
has
some
idea
of
what
the
case
is
about.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
understand
criminal
prosecution
to
main
proceedings
in
the
court.
that
is
my
understanding
from
the
prosecution.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
think
that
that
has
been
a
clear
implication
and
besides
if
that
rationale
were
to
be
extended
further,
or
were
to
be
accepted,
i
think
that
you
would
be
in
the
position
of
having
a
right
to
have
counsel.
for
example,
when
the
prosecutor
interviews
witnesses.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
understand
that,
but
there
is
still,
even
in
the
ordinary
context
of
the
criminal
trial,
there
are
large
number
of
instances
in
which
steps
are
taken
towards
successful
prosecution
of
which
defense
counsel
was
not
present.
fingerprint
comparisons
are
made,
the
witnesses
are
interviewed
by
prosecutors,
evidence
is
sometimes
discovered
long
after
indictment.
in
none
of
these
cases
is
defense
counsel
customarily
present
nor
has
this
court
ever
held
that
he
has
to
be
present.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
don't
--
i
can
not
imagine,
for
example,
any
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes,
but
i
think
that
wade
and
gilbert
were
wrongly
decided
as
far
as
arraignments
are
concerned.
i
have
no
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
i
was
merely
being
responsive
to
your
questions
mr.
justice
douglas,
as
to
what
criminal
prosecution
meant
after
indictment.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well
i
think
that
wade
and
gilbert
in
particular
is
a
--
if
anything
a
barrier
toward
effective
improvement
in
the
process
of
criminal
justice.
i
tend
to
think
that
what
wade
and
gilbert
did
and
the
thing
that
it
particularly
concerns
me,
is
the
right
to
counsel
in
wade
and
gilbert
and
the
right
to
counsel
in
lineup
seems
to
me
more
of
the
total
than
an
effective
remedy.
it's
a
way
of
saying,
well
these
are
difficult
problems
and
instead
of
attempting
to
regulate
the
process
we'll
appoint
counsel
and
he'll
regulate.
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
i
tend
to
think
that
that
is
what
underlay
the
basis
of
the
illinois
supreme
court's
holding,
which
limited
wade
and
gilbert
post-indictment
lineups
and
should
that
limitation
be
adopted
that
will
decide
this
case.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
this
court
could,
this
court
could.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
you
do
not
have
to
get
to
it.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes
you
would.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
not
otherwise.
if
the
pre-indictment,
post-indictment
distinction
in
the
illinois
supreme
court
were
considered
correct
then
wade
and
gilbert
would
not
have
to
be
reached
in
this
case.
it
was
considered
incorrect
and
it
would
have
to
be
reached.
the
net
effect,
i
think,
of
forcing
counsel
into
a
role
as
a
witness,
or
impartial
arbiter,
the
fairness
of
the
lineup
is
essentially
to
put
counsel
into
a
position
that
he
cannot
successfully
within
the
canons
of
ethics
sustain.
he's
no
more
qualified
in
the
court
to
solve
these
problems
and
to
solve
them,
he
has
to
depart
from
the
accepted
roles
of
a
counsel.
now
the
one
final
minor
point
that
i
would
like
to
raise
and
that
is
that
it
might
be
contended
and
replied
that
the
state
of
illinois
could
have
solved
these
problems
by
providing
for
administrative
procedures
to
regulate
lineups
in
accordance
with
the
opinion
in
wade.
i
point
out
that
that
opinion
and
the
language
is
contained
in
the
majority
of
opinions
was
expressly
disavowed
by
four
of
the
six
justices
who
joined
in
the
opinion,
that
it
is
hardly
reasonable
to
expect
the
states
to
rely
and
tell
the
police
department
yes
adopt
administrative
regulations,
deny
a
man
the
right
to
counsel
and
then
wait
two
or
three
years
to
determine
whether
what
has
been
done
is
constitutional
or
not.
the
one
existing
case
in
which
there
was
attempted
is
a
california
case,
people
versus
fowler,
in
which
california
police
department
attempted
to
adopt
regulations
and
the
california
supreme
court
said
that,
yes
administrative
regulations
might
render
lineups,
non-critical,
but
only
when
such
regulations
were
of
such
a
nature
to
ensure
that
a
lineup
would
be
as
accurate
as
ballistics
or
fingerprint
identification.
under
that
standard,
i
doubt
that
anybody
could
ever
draft
the
administrative
regulations
sufficient
to
make
the
lineup
a
non-critical
stage.
we
ask
that
wade
and
gilbert
be
overruled,
and
we
ask
that
the
judgment
hearing
be
affirmed.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
before
discussing
the
merits
on
the
legal
principles
involved,
i
would
like
to
clarify
two
or
three
--
the
factual
situations
involved
in
this
case.
the
arrest
occurred
as
counsel
of
the
petitioner
indicated,
because
two
police
officers
thought
that
the
petitioner
here
look
like
a
man
wanted
for
con
gang
(ph)
a
man
named
hampton
(ph).
two
police
officers
stopped
the
two
people,
petitioner
and
his
partner.
they
asked
petitioner
if
he
was
hampton
he
said
no,
he
was
not
hampton.
the
police
asked
if
he
had
any
identification,
when
the
petitioner
pulled
out
his
wallet
the
officer
noted
traveler’s
checks
in
the
petitioner’s
wallet
he
said
who
do
the
checks
belonged
to?
at
which
time
the
petitioner
said
“oh
that
is
play
money”
after
that
the
officers
said,
“let
me
see
them”
and
the
petitioner
handed
the
wallet
to
the
officer
who
looked
at
the
traveler’s
checks,
which
had
the
name
willie
shard
on
them
and
said,
“who
is
willie
shard?”
to
which
the
petitioner
responded,
“i
won
them
in
a
crap
game.”
the
appellate
court
of
illinois
upheld
that
initial
arrest
on
the
grounds
of
the
contradictory
explanations
for
the
possession
of
the
property,
plus
the
absence
of
any
identification
that
this
man
was
in
fact
willie
shard.
now
during
the
course
of
our
brief,
we
discussed
several
rules
of
application
for
united
states
versus
wade
and
when
i
refer
to
united
states
versus
wade,
i
of
course
include
gilbert
versus
california,
but
for
convenience
sake
referred
in
the
brief
and
will
refer
in
the
argument
to
wade.
we
point
out
that
there
is
one
exception
at
least
the
second
circuit
has
recognized
for
investigatory
show-ups
or
investigatory
confrontations,
when
that
argument
was
advanced
the
petitioners
replied
that
--
well
this
means
that
my
client
or
the
petitioner
was
arrested
on
grounds
of
suspicion
that
in
investigatory
--
the
stop
of
this
nature
was
not
based
on
probable
cause
and
if
that
position
had
been
taken
below,
then
this
case
will
not
be
hear
today.
i
have
to
differ
with
petitioner’s
counsel.
it
seems
to
me
that
hoffa
versus
united
states
in
385
us
definitely
rejected
the
proposition
that
investigatory
--
investigative
steps
cannot
be
set
to
occur
after
probable
cause
existed,
i
think
in
this
case
that
there
was
probable
cause.
and
that,
as
far
as
this
show-up
was
concerned
that
it
still
constituted
in
investigatory
show-up.
i
would
also
point
out,
with
respect
to
this
case,
we
raise
two
points:
the
first
is
that
we
do
defend,
despite
the
petitioner’s
assertion
to
the
contrary,
the
limitation
of
wade
to
post-indictment
cases,
that
is
point
one
of
our
brief.
we
also
attack
this
is
our
right
since
we
are
defending
a
judgment;
we
also
raise
the
broader
ground
of
the
overruling
in
wade.
i
would
address
myself
first
to
the
question
of
overruling.
i
would
also
point
out
that
when
we
ask
for
the
overruling
of
wade,
we
are
not
asking
for
the
overruling
of
stovall
v.
denno,
which
recognized
explicitly
a
due
process
right
under
the
due
process
clause
to
attack
unnecessarily
suggest
that
a
pre-trial
confrontations.
if
united
states
versus
wade
is
overruled
by
this
court,
it
does
not
put
out
of
the
reach
of
the
federal
courts
and
of
this
court,
questions
of
suggested
confrontations.
those
of
course,
can
still
be
reviewed
under
the
due
process
clause,
insofar
as
that
right
was
recognized
under
stovall
versus
denno.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes
more
precisely.
the
reason,
i
cite
wade
of
course,
is
that
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
it
was
the
first
case.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
and
if
united
states
versus
wade
is
the
right
to
counsels
to
be
continued
as
a
federal
requirement
under
supervisory
power
of
this
court
of
course,
had
no
standing--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes,
yes
it
was
but
it
incorporated
the
requirements
of
wade
and
ask
as
i
am
asking
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes
it
did,
your
honor.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes
it
did.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
no
i
do
not.
and
in
any
event,
it
would
be
--
i
am
not
--
position
of
the
state
of
illinois
asked
for
the
overruling
gideon’s
since
long
--
prior
to
gideon
--
illinois
provided
counsel
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes
and
of
course,
if
the
state
requires
that
i
would
not
be
in
the
position
to
ask.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well
i
would
--
it
is
at
that
point
mr.
justice
douglas
that
i
wish
to
address
myself,
but
direct
the
wade
case,
wade-gilbert
doctrine
adopted
right
to
counsel
at
lineups
under
a
critical
stage,
which
of
course
is
familiar,
at
least
the
language
is
familiar.
the
essential
basis
of
the
opinion
was
that
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
where
the
absence
of
counsel
might
affect
the
reliability
of
the
fact-finding
procedure.
that
is
a
critical
stage
and
the
right
to
counsel
attaches.
now,
our
first
submission
is
that
is
tightly
too
broad
a
standard,
because
the
presence
of
counsel,
at
least
if
you
assume
that
counsel’s
interest
is
in
a
fair
investigation
and
i
think
there
is
some
doubt
of
that.
but
even
if
you
assume
that
presence
of
counsel
reduces
a
danger
of
unreliable
evidence
at
every
stage,
in
which
evidence
is
gathered
and
all
of
the
well
recognized
exceptions
to
--
lower
court
exceptions
to
the
application
of
wade
would
come
under
this
reason.
the
prompt
identification
immediately
occurring
shortly
after
the
crime,
photographic
identification,
non-custodial
identification
procedures,
interviews
by
police
with
eye
witnesses,
appearance
of
witnesses
before
grand
juries.
all
of
these
cases
are
--
present
instances
in
which
the
presence
of
counsel
might
reduce
dangers
to
the
fact-finding
process
and
i
think
that
counsel
for
the
petitioner
is
quite
correct
in
its
reluctance
to
state
that
he
would
not
contend
that
the
right
to
counsel
attaches
to
these
points.
he
does
not
wish
to
reach
these
issues,
because
frankly
under
the
critical
stage
reasoning
of
wade
he
would
have
to
concede
that
the
right
to
counsel
attaches
at
all
of
these
points.
yet,
nearly
every
court
that
has
ruled
on
these
questions
has
held
no,
there
is
no
right
to
counsel.
further
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
non
custodial
identification
cases,
which
where
thehypothetical
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes
and
the
one
california
case,
which
holds
that
there
is
a
right
to
have
a
counsel
present
when
the
police
interview
eye
witnesses.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
supreme
court
of
california,
very
narrow
holding.
it
was
a
holding
in
which
the
lineup
was
conducted
with
the
presence
of
counsel;
the
witnesses
then
left
the
lineup
room
to
state
their
impressions
for
the
lineup.
counsel
asked
could
he
go
along
at
that
the
time
and
the
police
said,
“no
you
cannot,”
and
the
california
supreme
court
said,
“well,
since
counsel
was
there
and
it
would
not
have
caused
any
disruption
or
any
inconvenience
counsel
can
sit
there
while
the
police
ask
witnesses
the
question.”
however
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
a
court
i
believe
remanded
the
cause.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
it
was
based
on
the
united
states
constitution.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
in
my
opinion
for
purposes
of
right
to
counsel,
eye
witness
identification
never
presents
a
critical
stage.
i
think
that
the
right
to
counsel
at
a
lineup
is
an
inappropriate
right
and
that
is
why
i
am
asking
for
the
overruling
of
--
there
is
a
secondary
position
i
take
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
think
kirby
was
entitled
to
counsel
under
the
coleman
versus
alabama
at
that
time
of
this
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
do
not
know
how
many
days
later
it
was,
but
it
was
after
the
identification.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
think
he
was
charged
with
robbery
after
the
identification
by
shard.
i
do
not
think
there
was
a
formal
charge
entered
and
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
think
they
were
holding
him,
because
they
had
probable
cause
to
believe
he
had
stolen
the
traveler’s
checks,
but
of
course
they
did
not
know
until
shard
made
the
identification
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
we
do
know
why
mr.
justice
marshall
we
know
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
that
--
well,
we
know
that
he
had
traveler’s
checks
in
a
name
which
he
did
not
prove
to
be
his
own
and
we
know
that
he
gave
two
totally
inconsistent
explanations
for
his
possession
of
those
checks.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
i
think
it
gives
probable
cause
to
believe
that
he
may
have
stolen
those
checks.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes,
but
you
do
not
have
to
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
no
it
is
probable
cause
to
believe
that
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well
in
the
sense,
yes
of
course
you
do
not
have
to
establish
guilty
under
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
think
that
he
would
probably
have
been
released,
although
unless
he
could
show
that
he
was
willie
shard
and
the
traveler’s
checks
were
his,
the
police
might
keep
the
traveler’s
checks.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
that
seems
to
be
a
police
practice,
i
do
not
--
when
a
man
cannot
prove
the
property
is
his
and
especially
when
he
gives
conflicting
explanations.
and,
his
responses
were
rather
incredible,
his
first
response
was,
“oh,
it
is
play
money.”
and,
the
second
response,
“i
won
in
a
crap
game.”
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
do
not
think
he
was
charged
at
all
--
so
i
do
not
think
he
is
charged
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
would
assume
that
he
was
arrested.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that?
mr.
james
b.
zagel
no,
although
i
think
you
can
make
reasonable
assumptions
based
on
facts
in
the
records.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes
he
was
under
arrest.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well
except
my
point
is
that
i
do
not
think
you
can
draw
distinction
based
on
the
fact
that
the
man
is
under
arrest.
if
it
is
possible
--
if
identifying
a
man
who
is
under
arrest
in
a
single
show-up
standing
with
two
police
officers
standing
on
either
side
of
them
is
critical,
has
potentiality
for
suggestiveness,
which
requires
the
right
to
counsel.
it
is
no
different
if
it
occurs
shortly
after
the
crime.
it
is
no
different
--
the
same
potential
for
suggestion
exists.
the
same
potential
for
suggestion
exists
when
a
man
who
was
not
in
custody,
say
a
man
is
working
at
gas
station
and
the
police
suspect
him
of
the
crime
and
bring
a
couple
of
witnesses
by
and
point
him
out.
now,
i
am
not
saying
that
the
court
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
in
a
sense,
they
did
not
know
that
willie
shard
had
been
robbed,
but
it
would
be
a
very
dense
police
officer
who
faced
with
these
two
conflicting
explanations
plus
the
lack
of
any
identification
of
the
person
in
possession
of
the
check
is
willie
shard,
that
would
be
a
very
dense
police
officer
who
would
not
have
a
pretty
good
reason,
at
least
legally
sufficient
reason
to
suspect
that
this
man
had
stolen
that
property
or
at
least
was
in
the
possession
of
stolen
property.
now,
i
do
not
know
perhaps
if
only
one
of
the
explanations
had
been
given,
although
the
play
money
one
seems
incredible.
that
there
maybe
the
officer
might
not
have
had
probable
cause.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
he
has
not
challenge
the
arrest
here.
now,
i
point
also
that
in
wade,
the
court
was
concerned
with
the
potential
for
deliberate
police
suggestion,
deliberate
police
misconduct,
but
yet
the
court
in
wade
said
that
we
are
not
going
the
hold
at
the
taking
of
a
blood
test
or
the
taking
of
a
hand
writing
exemplars
is
a
critical
stage.
i
would
point
out
that
this
almost,
although
not
quite
the
same,
potential
for
abuse
in
those
cases
are
requiring
the
presence
of
counsels
as
there
is
in
the
eye
witness
identification
case.
at
least,
theoretically
possible
that
the
police
--
if
they
were
malicious
might
use
improper
methods
of
taking
blood
or
they
might
just
say
that
the
blood
taken
from
the
--
that
they
justified
was
taken
the
defendant,
it
was
never
taken
from
the
defendant
and
counsel
of
course
had
he
witnessed,
the
taking
of
blood
that
would
be
in
a
position
to
ensure
the
reliability,
the
fact
finding
procedure.
the
final
point
made
i
think
with
respect
to
the
rationale
within
wade
is
that
the
petitioner
in
a
lineup
--
when
he
challenges
the
lineup,
has
a
terrible
problem
reconstructing
what
occurred.
now,
i
do
not
know
that
the
problem
exists,
for
example,
there
did
not
seem
to
be
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
in
reconstructing
what
occurred
in
wade
or
what
occurred
in
gilbert
or
what
occurred
in
stovall,
there
does
not
seem
to
have
been
--
all
others
minor
disagreement
does
not
seem
to
have
been
much
difficulty
reconstructing
what
occurred
in
this
case.
and
furthermore,
that
problem
of
reconstruction
exists
in
every
one
of
the
accepted
cases
under
wade.
the
same
problem
of
reconstruction
of
prompt
identification,
the
same
problem
of
reconstruction
photographic
identification,
all
exists.
the
theory,
the
critical
stage
theory
of
wade,
i
submit
is
without
rational
limitations.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
no
i
do
not
suggest.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
i
would
--
as
i
recall
schmerber,
i
am
not
incidentally
suggesting
that
this
court
overrule
that
aspect
of
gilbert
and
schmerber
that
dealt
with
the
fifth
amendment.
i
am
dealing
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
no
i
am
dealing
solely
with
those
portions
of
the
case
dealt
with
the
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
sixth.
the
more
important
and
i
think
it
is
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes,
we
have
considered
that,
we
have
considered
that
--
we
consider
that
expressly
in
the
brief
and
our
concern
with
that
point
is,
is
that
you
have
a
difficult
problem,
if
you
assume
that
--
if
either
assumption
is
taken
and
the
fact
that
counsel
is
present
and
he
does
not
effectuate
a
fair
lineup
of
counsels
present
and
he
does.
if
he
does
not
effectuate
a
fair
lineup,
he
is
in
a
position
where
he
must
testify
as
a
witness,
which
may
disqualify
him
from
representing
the
defendant,
his
counsel.
furthermore,
as
professor
reed
(ph),
points
out
in
his
article,
there
really
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
attorney,
on
behalf
of
the
defendant
is
likely
to
be
viewed
as
anymore
impartial,
when
he
testifies
then
the
defendant
himself
is.
so,
i
think
that
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
that
is
the
alternative,
which
is
to
say
that
is
the
remedy
is
affected.
the
problem
with
that
is
you
may
still
have
to
testify,
not
as
the
defendant's
witness,
but
the
prosecutions.
because
what
he
sees
at
that
lineup
is
not
privilege,
it
does
not
involve
communications
from
his
client.
he
may
be
called
by
the
prosecution.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
that
brings
the
next
point.
if
he
is
successful
and
he
either
has
to
testify
against
this
client
or
he
says
to
his
client.
no,
i
am
not
going
to
challenge
the
identification,
no;
i
am
not
going
to
cross
examine
these
witnesses,
because
i
was
there
and
it
was
a
fair
lineup.
you
create
a
serious
breach
in
his
relationship
with
his
client,
not
only
that
you
are
undoubtedly
going
to
the
subject
to
attacks
for
being
unfaithful
to
this
client.
that
the
client
is
going
to
say
when
the
lawyer
says
“no,
we
are
not
going
to
take
this
lineup.”
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
i
do
not
know
that
is
a
fair
assumption.
i
tend
to
think
that
if
mr.
kirby’s
counsel-
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
i
would
ask
you
to
make
a
different
assumption,
i
would
ask
you
to
assumed
that
if
mr.
kirby
had
counsel
and
mr.
kirby’s
counsel
ensured
that
there
was
a
fair
line
up
although
that
is
not
his
job
to
ensure
that
this
is
a
fair
lineup.
it
is
his
job
to
ensure
that
there
is
a
lineup
weighted
in
favor
of
this
client.
assume
that
he
succeeded
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
i
think
that
maybe
mr.
justice
marshall
let
us
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
very
much
disagree
with
that
role
of
defense
counsel.
i
was
defense
counsel
myself
and
my
role
is
to
see
within
the
law
that
i
can
get,
if
i
can
get
an
acquittal
from
my
client
and
it
is
not
in
my
interest,
if
i
am
representing
a
guilty
client
to
see
that
there
is
a
perfectly
fair
lineup.
in
fact,
if
i
were
a
defense
counsel
i
find
it
difficult
to
make
a
decision
whether
to
object
to
an
unfair
lineup.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
no.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
no,
i
do
not.
but,
there
is
a
difference
standard
of
doing
on
prosecutors
than
there
is
in
defense
counsel.
there
is
no
equivalent
to
brady
and
maryland
for
defense
counsel.
but,
it
is
an
obligation
that
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
except
the
cannons,
which
are
unenforcible
and
i
do
not
that
the
cannons,
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
but
if
the
counsel
succeeds
by
his
presence
in
securing
a
fair
identification.
he
is
going
to
have
difficulties
with
his
client,
because
he
is
in
--
he
is
not--he
is
supposed
to
defend
his
client’s
interest,
and
he
is
supposed
to
advocate
his
client
cause.
he
is
not
supposed
to
be
a
witness.
he
is
not
supposed
to
assume
the
role
of
an
impartial
witness.
it
is
not
a
mere
technicality
that
the
cannon
say
that
a
man
should
not
both
lawyer
and
witness,
it
is
the
very
sound
reason
and
the
sound
reason
is
as
witness
his
testimony
may
damage
his
client’s
case.
and
that
is
why
i
think
counsel
is
particularly
inappropriate
vehicle
with
the
regulation
of
lineup
procedures.
we
point
out
that
the
regulation
of
lineups
can
be
accomplished
under
the
due
process
clause
under
stovall.
if
it
is
thought
that
there
is
a
sufficient
danger
of
improper
identification
procedures,
but
counsel
is
not
the
appropriate
technique
to
use.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
would
you
repeat
your
question
(voice
overlap)
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes,
that
is
true,
the
prosecutor
might
not
call,
but
the
risk
exists.
and
that
risk
might
influence
defense
counsel’s
tactics.
defense
it
may
be
very
well
be
that
a
defense
counsel
will
be
present
at
a
line,
he
will
think
that
the
lineup
is
fair,
it
will
tell
his
client,
“no,
i
am
not
going
to
raise
any
question,
as
the
lineup,”
and
the
trial
will
go
on
smooth
and
calm
and
nothing
will
happen
except
later
in
the
state
or
federal
proceeding
the
defendant
is
going
to
say
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
ineffective
assistant
of
counsel,
or
to
put
it
in
a
vernacular
of
a
client,
as
he
once
addressed
it
to
me
one,
i
said
i
was
not
going
to
raise
a
search
and
seizure,
the
question
is,
he
said,
who’s
side
you
are?
and
that
is
not
going
to
benefit
the
administration
of
criminal
justice.
i
might
also
add
that
this
has
to
be
viewed
in
context
of
the
fact,
that
there
is
very
little
in
a
way
of
legal
resources,
that
is
to
say
lawyers
who
meet
the
problem
of
counsel
at
lineups.
in
fact,
in
one
case,
randolph
(ph)
care
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
the
district
of
colombia,
which
has
a
provision,
legal
aid
agency
apparently
provides
counsel.
counsel
was
called
to
testify
at
a
motion
to
suppress.
at
his
testimony,
he
could
not
remember
whether
he
represented
the
defendant
randolph,
he
came
back
the
next
day
and
said
well,
he
had
thought
it
over
very
carefully
and
he
had
a
vague
recollection
that
he
represented
randolph.
and,
then
they
said,
“what
happened?
he
said,
“well,
i
will
have
to
look
at
my
notes,”.
in
effect
what
counsel
did
is
he
testified
from
his
notes.
now,
i
do
not
know
why
his
notes
are
going
to
be
better
than
a
photograph
of
a
lineup.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
think
it
is
a
practical
way
of
assuring
all
of
the
fairness
that
the
presence
of
counsel
is
supposed
to
assure.
there
are
some
questions
of
fairness
that
admittedly
not
even
counsel
can
assure.
for
example,
before
the
lineup,
the
police
can
say
to
a
man,
to
the
witness,
the
man
who
is
the
3rd
one
from
the
left,
we
found
his
stolen
property,
your
stolen
property
in
his
house
and
he
has
got
a
record
that
as
long
as
your
armed
and
he
has
done
it
many
times
and
several
people
who
saw
him
come
out
of
your
house
have
identified
him.
now,
that
clearly
suggest
the
practice,
but
that
is
not
something
that
is
reached
under
the
right
to
counsel
in
any
event
that
is
reached
under
the
due
process
aspect.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
no,
it
is
not.
there
was
language
in
the
opinion
in
wade
that
suggested
that
perhaps
administrative
regulations
would
all
be
the
necessity
for
counsel.
the
problem
with
that
language
and
problem
with
asking
the
state
to
rely
on
that
language
is
that
three
of
the
justices,
who
concurred
with
the
majority
opinion
explicitly,
rejected
that.
the
fourth
justice,
who
concurred,
said
nothing
on
the
point,
and
so
far
as
i
know
the
only
case
which
is
dealt
with
administrator
regulations
is
to
file
of
(ph)
case
in
supreme
court
in
california,
where
they
just
simply
said
that
the
regulations
would
have
to
be
so
strong
as
to
ensure
that
there
no
suggestive
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes,
but
there
is
an
existing
regulation,
which
existed
before
the
time
of
wade,
gilbert
or
stovall,
which
prescribed
certain
procedures
for
lineups,
strangely
enough
defense
counsel
have
not
used
it.
i
do
not
know
why
they
have
not,
they
never
called
the
police
in
and
used
the
regulations
in
cross
examining
police
officers
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
no,
no
there
was
a
prior
to
the
time
of
the
palmer
decision,
there
were
some
draft
regulations
concerning
right
to
counsel
and
many
police
officers
of
course,
were
aware
of
the
decision
and
there
are
fair
number
of
cases
involving
warnings
to
the
right
to
counsel
and
even
a
few
in
which
counsel
was
present
in
the
lineup,
but
there
have
been
no
formal
regulations,
promulgated
as
a
result
of
those
decisions.
i
point
out
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes,
but
i
would
submit
that
it
would
be
difficult
for
me,
for
example,
advising
a
police
to
say
that,
that
aspect
of
the
opinion
was
the
holding
the
court.
so
far
as
i
can
understand
--
so,
far
as
i
could
infer
mr.
justice
brennan,
you
were
the
only
justice
in
the
court
who
definitely
a
committed
himself
to
that
proposition.
although,
perhaps
mr.
justice
clark
did,
as
well.
but
three
of
those
who
were
to
join
with
you
in
the
opinion
did
not
adhere
to
that.
that
is
why
if
it
had
been
a
little
more
clear
cut
perhaps
we
might
be
arguing
a
different
issue
today
and
that
i
think
is
responsible
for
the
reluctance
the
california
supreme
court
to
prove
the
regulations
in
the
fowler
case.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
no,
i
think
that
it
was
investigatory
in
the
sense
that
i
think
if
shard
had
said,
“no,
that
is
not
the
man,”
they
would
have
been
released.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
think
it
was
investigatory
in
nature.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
think
that
is
an
additional
reason
for
taking
out
of
wade
and
gilbert,
if
wade
and
gilbert
is
the
stand.
in
conclusion,
i
simply
state
that
as
far
as
wade
is
concerned,
and
gilbert
involves
the
insertion
of
counsel
and
to
a
role
in
which
he
has
needed
the
capacity,
authority
or
ethical
obligation
to
fulfill
and
fulfill
adequately
and
that
insertion
counsel
in
to
that
situation
ought
to
end
and
wade
and
gilbert
to
the
extent
that
they
required
ought
to
be
overruled.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
here
today
to
ask
for
the
overruling
of
the
united
states
versus
wade
and
gilbert
versus
california,
insofar
as
they
established
a
right
to
counsel
at
lineups.
it
should
be
made
clear
that
we
do
not
ask
for
the
overruling
of
stovall
versus
denno.
insofar
as
it
established
or
affirmed
a
due
process
right
of
an
accused
to
have
a
fair
or
non-suggested
lineup.
we
do
not
propose
therefore
that
a
person
agreed
by
an
unnecessarily
suggested
lineup
should
be
deprived
of
law,
state
and
federal
remittance.
with
respect
to
the
petitioner's
oral
argument,
there
are
at
least
four
or
five
points
that
i
would
like
to
clarify,
if
i
may
briefly.
petitioner
in
his
oral
argument
has
claimed
that
this
particular
case
can
be
resolved
on
stovall
grounds,
he
assumes
without
any
basis
that
we
concede
this.
in
fact,
point
one
of
the
certiorari
petition
directly
raised
the
stovall's
point
and
that
point
of
the
certiorari
petition
was
not
taken
by
this
court.
the
stovall
issue
was
decided
in
the
appellate
court
below.
it
is
available
on
habeas
corpus.
if
the
petitioner
should
fail
in
this
court
but
it
is
not
available,
i
think,
to
be
raised
here
and
now.
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
the
appendix,
you
will
note
that
the
motion
is
suppressed
the
trial.
the
only
issue
abstract
is
the
issue
of
denial
of
counsel.
the
only
testimony
abstracted
is
the
statements
of
bean
and
kerby
that
they
were
not
advised
the
right
to
counsel.
the
other
point
with
respect
to
stovall
is
that
the
witness
shard
was
not
told
of
the
fact
that
traveler's
checks
had
been
recovered
from
bean
and
kerby.
the
appendix
page
27
makes
it
quite
clear.
it
is
also
quite
clear
from
the
record
of
appendix
31
and
36
that
the
identification
by
shard
was
instantaneous
and
that
at
the
time,
shard
was
brought
to
the
police
station,
he
was
accompanied
by
an
officer
who
knew
nothing
of
the
facts
of
the
case,
had
not
seen
the
suspects
and
did
not
know
who
was
suspect.
the
last
point
that
i
want
to
make
generally
with
respect
to
petitioner's
argument
on
the
eyewitness
identification
generally
is,
the
petitioners
argue
that
the
eyewitness
identification,
the
testimony
in
court
is
perhaps
the
most
potent
of
all
evidence.
they
said,
at
least
there
is
some
element
of
irony
in
that
argument
when
this
case
was
initially
argued,
was
argued
on
november
11th
and
it
was
immediately
preceded
by
argument
in
another
illinois
case,
lega
versus
tumi
(ph),
which
involved
the
burden
of
proof
volunteering
this
little
confession.
i
can
clearly
recall,
petitioner's
counsel
in
that
case
pointing
out
that
confessions
were
by
far
the
most
potent
evidence
far
off
distancing
eyewitness
identification
and
therefore
subject
to
increasing
safeguards.
in
fact,
petitioner's
argument
that
the
trial
identification
is
so
crucial
and
so
inherently
suggestive,
is
essentially
an
argument
that
there's
a
constitutional
right
that
would
lineup
in
the
court
room.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
constitutional
right
to
have
a
counsel
at
a
pre-trial
confrontation.
petitioner
also
assumes,
and
i
really
assume
as
perhaps
too
weak
a
word
i
would
say,
(inaudible)
for
a
supposed
concession
by
the
respondent
that
the
arrest
in
this
case
was
illegal.
again,
i
want
to
point
out
that
this
issue,
the
legality
of
the
arrest
was
raised
again
at
point
3
of
the
certiorari
petition,
that
was
not
taken
by
this
court.
i
would
also
point
that
there
seems
to
be
a
fundamental
misconception
in
petitioner's
reasoning
with
respect
to
this
issue
and
that
is,
he
assumes
that
as
soon
as
we
say
that
a
confrontation
was
investigatory
in
nature
that
represents
a
concession
that
probable
clause
did
not
exist.
now,
this
dichotomy
that
as
soon
as
probable
clause
exists,
investigation
must
stop
or
procedures
can
no
longer
be
classified
as
investigative
in
nature.
that
was
raised
once
before
and
explicitly
rejected
by
this
court
in
hoffa
versus
united
states,
385
u.s.,
page
309-310,
in
which
the
court
clearly
held
that
there
was
no
duty
to
call
a
halt
to
investigation.
the
moment
that
the
police
have
probable
cause,
a
quantum
of
evidence
which
may
fall
far
short
of
that
necessary
to
convict.
finally
as
one
clarifying,
and
the
ast
clarifying
point
with
respect
to
the
reversal
of
the
conviction
of
the
code
offended
bean,
the
reason
that
there
was
an
absolute
reversal
in
that
case
was
because
since
the
arrest
of
bean
was
thought
to
be
illegal
and
it
should
be
clear
that
bean
was
not
in
possession
of
shard's
traveler's
checks
and
did
not
give
the
patently
false
and
contradictory
explanations
of
how
he
came
into
possession
of
those
traveler's
checks.
since,
bean's
arrest
being
substantially
different
from
kirby's,
since
that
arrest
was
declared
illegal,
not
only
was
the
resulting
identification
suppressed
by
the
appellate
court
but
so
too
was
that
evidence
of
shard's
cards
and
identification
materials
which
was
found
on
bean's
purse
subsequent
to
the
arrest.
in
effect,
all
of
the
evidence,
both
physical
evidence
and
identification
evidence,
was
suppressed
in
bean's
case
and
that
is
substantially
different
from
the
case
before
the
court.
that
seems
to
me
that
petitioner
seeks
to
avoid
the
issue
in
this
case
which
is
whether
the
admission
of
evidence
of
the
pre-trial
confrontation
without
counsel
violated
the
per
se
exclusion
rule
of
wade
gilbert,
indeed
his
oral
argument
thus
far
has
been
devoid
of
any
defense
of
the
wade-gilbert
doctrine.
i
am
concerned
with
the
right
to
counsel
at
lineups,
the
wade-gilbert
doctrine
is
too
prong.
first
we
think
that
the
theoretical
underpinning
is
unsound.
wade
and
gilbert
had,
that
a
lineup
a
critical
stage
requiring
counsel
because
the
presence
of
counsel
might
serve
to
enhance
the
reliability
of
the
lineup
procedure.
the
concept
of
counsel
as
a
surety
for
reliable
investigation
of
crime
represented
a
shift
in
the
critical
stage
rational
previously
used
by
this
court.
this
reliable
investigation
theory,
i
think
carries
too
far,
if
it
is
applied
seriously,
it
would
require
the
presence
of
counsel
at
every
stage
of
an
investigation.
in
our
brief
we
discussed
several
common
instances
in
which
the
courts
have
routinely
refused
to
apply,
right
to
counsel,
among
these
are
non-custodial
confrontations,
viewing
of
photographs
of
suspects,
confrontations
occurring
shortly
after
the
crime.
it
seems
to
me
that
counsel
can
be
as
useful
in
these
cases
as
it
can
that
the
lineups
involved
in
wade
and
gilbert,
in
one
area
of
particular
interest,
that
to
which,
i
think,
the
amicus
curiae
will
also
go
is
that
of
the
argument
that
counsel
ought
to
be
present
when
the
police
interview
eyewitnesses.
frankly,
if
wade
and
gilbert's
premises
are
accepted
it
seems
to
me
a
persuasive
argument
because
that
is
the
time
when
police
presumably
can
engage
and
suggest
the
practices
which
were
definitely
a
concern
of
instant
need,
the
lineup
cases.
that
is
the
time
when
suggestions
and
other
evidence
can
be
planted
in
the
witnesses'
mind
and
indeed
one
court,
the
california
court,
the
supreme
court
has
decided
that
in
fact,
counsel
has
to
be
present
at
interviews
of
eyewitnesses.
now,
i
think
that
under
wade's
rationale,
the
right
to
counsel
probably
could
be
extended
to
grand
jury
proceedings
and
even
frankly
to
scientific
tests.
now,
it
is
true,
for
example,
that
in
wade
and
gilbert,
scientific
testing
was
accepted.
the
court
said,
we
are
not
going
to
insist
on
the
right
to
counsel
to
be
present
when
scientific
testing
of
the
evidence
goes
on.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
the
court
against
the
concern
in
the
lineup
cases
with
deliberate
suggestion
on
the
part
of
the
police,
a
deliberate
suggestion
that
amounts
to
tampering
with
evidence
and
that
possibility
exists
in
scientific
testing
as
well.
now,
we
have
made
this
argument,
frankly.
our
core
that
the
rationale,
at
great
length
in
our
brief
and
i
have
no
wish
to
deliver
it
here
since
we
would
not
ask
this
court
to
overrule
the
decision
merely
because
its
rationale
seems
unpersuasive.
our
principal
objection,
is
that
promulgating
a
right
to
counsel
at
lineups,
is
singularly
inappropriate
as
the
solution
to
lineup
problems.
so
as
far
as
we
have
been
able
to
discovering
the
reported
decisions,
the
purpose
of
counsel
at
a
lineup
is
to
act
as
a
witness,
and
by
his
presence
to
deter
unfairness.
the
problems
with
his
functioning,
in
this
manner
are
manifest.
but
the
one
point
that
i
ought
to
make
clear
is,
it's
seem
to
me
obvious,
that
no
other
function
can
be
served
by
counsel
at
a
lineup
other
than
that
of
witness.
he
cannot
of
course
be
placed
in-charge
of
the
lineup,
under
the
decisions
in
wade
and
gilbert,
he
cannot
prevent
the
line
up
and
that
this
incidentally
is
a
significant
difference
between
lineup
problems
and
those
involving
interrogation
where
defense
counsel
can
effectively
prevent
the
police
from
interrogation.
he
cannot
prevent
the
lineup.
his
sole
purpose
is,
that
as
a
witness
indeed,
i
doubt
that
interest
of
counsel
is
such
that
he
would
want
to
promote
a
fair
lineup.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
purpose
of
counsel,
is
to
secure
a
lineup
that
is
unfair,
as
unfair
as
possible,
in
favor
of
his
own
client.
his
suggestions
that
he
gives
to
the
police,
need
not
be
accepted.
the
police
of
course
can,
i
think
have
just
concerns
to
whether
counsel
is
interested
in
fairness,
or
interested
in
protecting
his
client,
and
i
think
a
reasonable
police
officer
could
conclude
that
the
primary
purpose
of
counsel
suggestions
is
not
to
secure
fairness,
but
to
secure
some
advantage
for
his
client.
and
of
course,
counsel
is
in
a
terribly
difficult
tactical
position.
if
his
client
is
guilty,
and
i
think
it
can
be
fairly
stated
that
this
is
the
case
in
most
situations,
he
will
be
slow
to
attempt
to
if
he
sees
for
example,
deficiencies
in
the
line
up.
he
is
going
to
be
slow
to
attempt
to
clean
this
up.
i
don't
think
counsel
wants
to
validate
the
police
lineup
that
maybe
his
only
point,
his
only
legal
recourse
to
try.
and
so
far
as
we
are
aware
there
is
no
contemporaneous
objection
with
respect
to
what
counsel
has
to
do
with
lineup.
we
know
of
no
court
that
has
required
counsel,
police
present
at
the
lineup
to
make
objections
to
the
lineup,
at
the
time
of
the
lineup,
or
forever
waive
his
objections.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
law
is
clear
that
even
if
counsel
is
at
the
lineup,
he
can
raise
objections
to
its
fairness
at
trial.
so
it
is
really
very
much,
not
in
the
interest
of
counsel
to
make
objections,
to
make
suggestions.
first
of
all,
or
rather
next
with
respect
to
its
effectiveness
as
a
witnesses,
it
was
thought
i
think
in
the
opinion
that
counsel
would
be
particularly
effective
and
his
client
would
not
be
particularly
effective
as
a
witness.
i
think
perhaps,
it
is
a
somewhat
of
a
misjudgment.
i
do
not
think
that
counsel
for
a
party
will
be
regarded
by
a
jury,
or
by
a
court
as
essentially
more
neutral,
than
his
client.
he
is
not
necessarily
an
expert
in
lineup
procedure,
in
what
is
fair
and
what
is
not
fair
in
a
lineup.
since
all
he
does,
his
witness
to
lineup
itself,
he
will
not
have
the
occasion
for
example,
to
witness
outside
influence.
he
will
not
for
example,
if
he
want
to
assume
a
horrible
case,
counsel
may
be
present
at
the
lineup,
as
the
police
lead
the
witness
in.
the
policeman
might
say
before
the
witness
where
he
gets
into
the
lineup
room.
that
the
man
we
think
did
it,
or
the
man
on
whom
stolen
property
was
found,
is
the
man
standing
second
from
the
left.
now,
counsel
will
not
witness
that,
and
that
kind
of
suggestion
can
be
brought
out
only
in
cross
examination.
and
i
assume
that
cross
examination
will
be
effective
indeed,
it
was
not
difficult
for
counsel
in
wade,
or
counsel
in
gilbert,
or
counsel
in
stovall,
to
recreate
the
circumstances
of
the
lineup.
even
though
counsel
in
none
of
those
cases
was
present
at
lineup.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
it
is
not
required
in
illinois
to
take
photographs
of
lineups.
it
is
a
practice
of
varying
prevalence.
there
are
photographs
of
some
lineups,
there
are
not
photographs
of
others.
i
have
never
been
able
to
determine
a
live
photographs
taken
in
particular
cases
or
not
in
others.
it's
been
my
experience
in
the
lineups
where
at
a
central
police
headquarters
or
when
lineups
were
conducted
in
a
more
deliberate
fashion,
that
photographs
have
been
taken.
i
would
be
extremely
surprised
if
a
routine
station
has
line
up
led
to
a
photograph.
although,
i
understand
that
there
were
some
regulations
under
consideration.
i
really
cannot
speak
with
authority
and
there
are
not
a
large
number
of
cases
involving
photographs
of
lineups
in
illinois.
it
is
our
contention
of
course
that
---
mr.
james
b.
zagel
no,
it
was
not
a
lineup,
it
was
a
show
up.
and
i
again
reiterate
in
this
case,
particularly
as
an
illustration
that
a
counsel
for
kirby
seemed
to
have
no
difficulty
in
reconstructing
the
circumstances
of
this
particular
show
up.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
i
don't
think
that,
that
would
have
had
any
bearing
whatsoever
in
the
lineup.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
am
certain
he
could
have,
i
am
certain
he
could
have,
i
don't
know
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
he
probably
could
have
said
that,
but
i
very
much
doubt
that
that
would
have
been
affected
but
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
police
could
have
arrested
in
fact,
i
think
probably
did
arrest
and
probably
could
have
charged.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
think
it's
clear
that
they
were
under
arrest,
they
had
not
been
formally
charged.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
think
that
they
were
properly
arrested
under
illinois
law
exercising
unauthorized
control
of
the
property.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
might,
i
think
it
is
my
contention
that
investigation
and
investigatory
steps
are
not
inconsistent
with
the
post-arrest
precedence.
in
this
case,
you
had
a
valid
arrest
for
exercising
unauthorized
control
over
the
property
of
another.
you
had
an
investigatory
proceeding
with
respect
to
whether
they
should
be
charged
with
robbery.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
don't
know,
it's
not
clear
in
the
record.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
i
would
suggest
that
those
problems
and
i
don't
mean
to
minimize,
are
not
particularly
relevant
to
the
issues
before
the
court.
i
think
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
--
now
the
question
of
the
lineup
and
of
counsel's
role
at
the
lineup
and
i
think
they
also
again
that
they
will
not
take
advice
for.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
think
that,
i
would
not
contend
that
that
is
the
case,
that
police
can
do
that
but
i
would
say
that,
that
is
not
the
case
here.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
think
they
brought
the
petitioner
back
to
the
police
station,
i
don't
know
if
they
called
shard,
they
might
have
just
gone
through,
there
is
a
way
you
can
call
the
central
files
and
find
out
if
a
crime
has
been
reported,
the
traveler's
checks
had
been
stolen
and
that
is
what
they
did
in
this
case
i
think.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes,
i
think
that
they
--
i
think
what
they
had
at
that
time
was
the
basis
for
arresting
for
what
an
illinois
is
called
exercising
and
unauthorized
control
over
the
property.
well,
now
that
the
reason
they
had
that
the
basis
was
because
they
had,
in
this
case,
in
somewhat
unusual
clearly
identifiable
property.
it
had
an
owner
whose
name
was
willie
shard
and
he
was
in
the
possession
of
a
man
named
kirby
and
the
man
named
kirby
had
given
two
conflicting
explanations
as
to
how
he
had
come
in
to
possession
of
the
property.
i
tend
to
think
that
might
possibly
be
sufficient
evidence
to
convict
for
exercising
unauthorized
control
over
the
property
over
in
illinois.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
oh
no,
it
wasn't
a
very
long
time,
at
least
perhaps
and
i
think
maybe
an
hour
or
two
before
they
knew
that
the
property
had
been
stolen
from
shard
but
of
course,
they
still
didn't
know
that
this
man
had
committed
the
robbery.
even
so
they
would
still
only
have
the
basis
to
believe
that
they
were
exercising
unauthorized
control
over
the
property
of
(inaudible).
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
i
think
it
is.
if
all
it
were,
were
ineffective
i
suppose
it
could
survive.
there
are
two
problems
that
i
have,
two
general
areas
of
concern.
the
first
is
of
course,
it
does
present
a
severe
strain
on
legal
resources,
if
you
pick
counsel
for
this
you
could
deprive
other
people
of
these
legal
resources
that
maybe
the
minor
point.
the
more
significant
one
is
that
the
study
in
the
district
of
columbia
which
was
done
by
professor
reid
in
the
ucla
law
review,
indicated
that
there
were
incidents
of
intimidation
of
witnesses,
there
were
incidents
of
deliberate
altering
of
the
suspect's
appearance.
once
counsel
had
entered
the
case,
and
more
significantly,
if
counsel
for
example,
does
attend
the
lineup,
that
is
perfectly
fair.
he
is
going
to
be
in
a
very
difficult
position
of
being
subject
to
being
called
as
a
witness,
and
not
on
his
own
behalf
or
not
on
his
client's
behalf
but
on
behalf
of
the
prosecution.
what
he
sees
that
the
lineup
is
not
privileged,
fairly
strong
line
of
cases
which
are
cited
in
our
brief
on
that
point.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
there
is
no
evidence
on
that.
there
are
two
things
i
can
say
and
that
the
first
is
that
since
the
illinois
supreme
court
has
given
a
relatively
narrow
interpretation
for
the
applicability
of
wade
and
gilbert
that
is
to
say
is
to
find
the
post
indictment,
the
confrontations.
i
doubt
that
there
ever
would
be
any
great
evidences
to
their
particular
effect.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
that
ground
is
argued,
they
are
fully
in
our
brief.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
and
we
stand
on
that
as
well.
stand
on
that
as
well.
it
is
i
think
a
very
interesting
example
of
what
happens
when
counsel
do
attempt
or
the
bar
attempts
to
fulfill
the
mandate
of
wade
and
gilbert,
is
illustrated
of
course
in
professor
reid's
article
in
which
at
least
from
his
interviews
with
defense
counsel,
we
found
that
they
felt
kind
of
impotent
and
useless
at
the
lineups.
i
think
what's
even
more
significant
is
that
the
kind
of
an
odd
case,
united
states
versus
randolph
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
which
a
legal
aid
attorney
was
called
to
testify
on
his
client's
behalf,
and
he
was
the
man
who
was
assigned
to
the
police
station
to
be
present
at
the
time
that
these
lineups
occured.
and
not
only
could
he
not
remember
the
circumstances
of
the
lineup,
he
had
to
go
back
to
his
notes
to
determine
whether
he
had
represented
randolph
and
return
the
next
day
and
said
that
he'd
represented
randolph
and
then
testified
essentially
from
his
notes.
i
think
that
that
would
be
the
general
experience
in
any
jurisdiction
which
is
attempted
to
comply
with
wade
and
gilbert.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
that
was
a
pre-indictment
lineup.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes,
after
indictment,
defendant,
now
today,
i
suppose
after
preliminary
hearing,
a
defendant
would
have
an
individual
lawyer,
one
of
the
significant
differences
between
the
ordinary
case
such
as
this
one
and
the
post
indictment
or
post
preliminary
hearing
lineup.
so
usually
at
that
stage,
the
later
stage,
you
have
counsel
who
has
some
idea
of
what
the
case
is
about.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
understand
criminal
prosecution
to
main
proceedings
in
the
court.
that
is
my
understanding
from
the
prosecution.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
think
that
that
has
been
a
clear
implication
and
besides
if
that
rationale
were
to
be
extended
further,
or
were
to
be
accepted,
i
think
that
you
would
be
in
the
position
of
having
a
right
to
have
counsel.
for
example,
when
the
prosecutor
interviews
witnesses.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
understand
that,
but
there
is
still,
even
in
the
ordinary
context
of
the
criminal
trial,
there
are
large
number
of
instances
in
which
steps
are
taken
towards
successful
prosecution
of
which
defense
counsel
was
not
present.
fingerprint
comparisons
are
made,
the
witnesses
are
interviewed
by
prosecutors,
evidence
is
sometimes
discovered
long
after
indictment.
in
none
of
these
cases
is
defense
counsel
customarily
present
nor
has
this
court
ever
held
that
he
has
to
be
present.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
don't
--
i
can
not
imagine,
for
example,
any
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes,
but
i
think
that
wade
and
gilbert
were
wrongly
decided
as
far
as
arraignments
are
concerned.
i
have
no
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
i
was
merely
being
responsive
to
your
questions
mr.
justice
douglas,
as
to
what
criminal
prosecution
meant
after
indictment.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well
i
think
that
wade
and
gilbert
in
particular
is
a
--
if
anything
a
barrier
toward
effective
improvement
in
the
process
of
criminal
justice.
i
tend
to
think
that
what
wade
and
gilbert
did
and
the
thing
that
it
particularly
concerns
me,
is
the
right
to
counsel
in
wade
and
gilbert
and
the
right
to
counsel
in
lineup
seems
to
me
more
of
the
total
than
an
effective
remedy.
it's
a
way
of
saying,
well
these
are
difficult
problems
and
instead
of
attempting
to
regulate
the
process
we'll
appoint
counsel
and
he'll
regulate.
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
i
tend
to
think
that
that
is
what
underlay
the
basis
of
the
illinois
supreme
court's
holding,
which
limited
wade
and
gilbert
post-indictment
lineups
and
should
that
limitation
be
adopted
that
will
decide
this
case.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
this
court
could,
this
court
could.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
you
do
not
have
to
get
to
it.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes
you
would.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
not
otherwise.
if
the
pre-indictment,
post-indictment
distinction
in
the
illinois
supreme
court
were
considered
correct
then
wade
and
gilbert
would
not
have
to
be
reached
in
this
case.
it
was
considered
incorrect
and
it
would
have
to
be
reached.
the
net
effect,
i
think,
of
forcing
counsel
into
a
role
as
a
witness,
or
impartial
arbiter,
the
fairness
of
the
lineup
is
essentially
to
put
counsel
into
a
position
that
he
cannot
successfully
within
the
canons
of
ethics
sustain.
he's
no
more
qualified
in
the
court
to
solve
these
problems
and
to
solve
them,
he
has
to
depart
from
the
accepted
roles
of
a
counsel.
now
the
one
final
minor
point
that
i
would
like
to
raise
and
that
is
that
it
might
be
contended
and
replied
that
the
state
of
illinois
could
have
solved
these
problems
by
providing
for
administrative
procedures
to
regulate
lineups
in
accordance
with
the
opinion
in
wade.
i
point
out
that
that
opinion
and
the
language
is
contained
in
the
majority
of
opinions
was
expressly
disavowed
by
four
of
the
six
justices
who
joined
in
the
opinion,
that
it
is
hardly
reasonable
to
expect
the
states
to
rely
and
tell
the
police
department
yes
adopt
administrative
regulations,
deny
a
man
the
right
to
counsel
and
then
wait
two
or
three
years
to
determine
whether
what
has
been
done
is
constitutional
or
not.
the
one
existing
case
in
which
there
was
attempted
is
a
california
case,
people
versus
fowler,
in
which
california
police
department
attempted
to
adopt
regulations
and
the
california
supreme
court
said
that,
yes
administrative
regulations
might
render
lineups,
non-critical,
but
only
when
such
regulations
were
of
such
a
nature
to
ensure
that
a
lineup
would
be
as
accurate
as
ballistics
or
fingerprint
identification.
under
that
standard,
i
doubt
that
anybody
could
ever
draft
the
administrative
regulations
sufficient
to
make
the
lineup
a
non-critical
stage.
we
ask
that
wade
and
gilbert
be
overruled,
and
we
ask
that
the
judgment
hearing
be
affirmed.
