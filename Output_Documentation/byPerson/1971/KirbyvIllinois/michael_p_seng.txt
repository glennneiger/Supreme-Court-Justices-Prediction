mr.
michael
p.
seng
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
presented
in
this
case
is
narrow.
this
court
granted
cert
on
whether
due
process
require
that
an
accused
be
advised
of
his
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel,
prior
to
a
pre-indictment
show-up,
held
at
a
police
station.
several
hours
after
the
accused
arrest
and
some
48
hours
after
the
alleged
crime
occurred.
illinois
has
held
that
counsel
is
not
required
at
any
pre-indictment
show-up.
mr.
michael
p.
seng
we
submit
that
this
rule
is
too
broad
and
that
under
the
narrow
facts
of
this
case,
counsel
should
have
been
provided.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
not
complicated.
on
february
20th,
1968,
at
about
4:30
in
the
afternoon,
willie
shard
was
walking
down
a
street
in
chicago,
when
he
noticed
two
men
following
about
15
feet
behind
him.
he
however,
paid
no
particular
attention
to
them.
as
he
turned
to
enter
a
restaurant,
a
man
grabbed
him
from
behind,
while
another
man
took
from
his
pocket,
$30
or
$35
in
cash,
$145
in
traveler’s
checks,
his
wallet
and
all
his
identification
papers.
the
men
then
went
one
way
and
shard
went
another.
mr.
michael
p.
seng
it
was
not
until
the
next
day
that
shard
notified
the
police
and
gave
them
a
general
description
of
the
height,
weight
and
complexion
of
the
two
men.
two
days
later,
on
february
22nd,
at
about
11
in
the
morning,
thomas
kirby,
the
petitioner
in
this
action,
and
ralph
bean
were
walking
down
on
a
street
in
chicago.
at
the
same
time
two
chicago
police
officers,
the
isaac
panapinto
and
james
reesy
(ph)
were
cruising
in
a
unmarked
squad
car.
officer
panapinto
(ph)
remarked
to
his
partner
that
kirby
resembled
alfonso
hampton,
a
man
supposedly
wanted
by
the
chicago
police
for
perpetrating
a
crap
game.
the
officers
then
stopped
the
two
men.
when
asked
for
his
identification,
kirby
pulled
out
his
wallet
and
as
he
pulled
out
his
wallet,
the
officers
noticed
traveler’s
check
bearing
the
name
willie
shard.
when
asked
to
whom
these
checks
belonged,
kirby
responded
that
they
were
play
money
or
that
he
had
won
them
in
a
crap
game,
the
officers
then
searched
bean
and
found
identification
papers
bearing
the
name
willie
shard.
mr.
michael
p.
seng
no,
they
did
not
your
honor.
it
was
not
until
after
they
returned
to
the
police
station
and
had
checked
police
records
that
the
officers
first
learned
that
this
robbery
and
that
fact
is
i
think
it
is
incontestable
in
this
matter.
mr.
michael
p.
seng
that
is
possible
your
honor.
we
argued
probable
cause
for
arrest
in
the
illinois
appellate
court
--(voice
overlap)
when
the
men
were
taken
to
the
police
station,
the
officer,
after
learning
that
willie
shard
had
been
robbed,
telephoned
shard
and
told
them
that
they
had
the
two
suspects,
whom
they
wanted
him
to
look
at.
another
officer
was
sent
to
pick
up
shard.
when
shard
arrived
at
the
police
station,
kirby
and
bean
being,
who
happened
to
be
black
proceeded
between
officers
panapinto
and
reesy
in
a
large
squad
room.
when
shard
enter
the
room,
the
officers
asked
him
if
these
were
the
two
men.
shard
responded
affirmatively.
no
lineup
was
ever
held
in
this
case,
this
was
the
only
identification
that
took
place
before
trial.
at
no
time
prior
to
this
identification
show-up
was
either
kirby
or
being
advised
of
his
right
to
counsel.
in
fact,
the
public
defender
was
not
appointed
until
approximately
7
weeks
after
their
arrest
and
8
days
after
indictment
was
returned.
prior
to
trial,
kirby’s
counsel
filed
a
pretrial
motion
to
suppress
the
identification
testimony.
this
motion
was
denied.
at
trial,
shard
testified
that
the
men
in
the
courtroom
on
that
date
were
the
men
whom
he
identified
at
the
police
station.
bean
waived
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
took
the
stand
and
testified
that
he
and
kirby
found
the
traveler’s
check,
screwing
in
an
alley
way,
several
hours
prior
to
the
time
of
their
arrest.
we
respectfully
submit
the
fifth
case
that
is
directly
controlled
by
this
court’s
decisions
in
united
states
versus
wade
and
gilbert
versus
california.
the
state,
at
least
in
its
brief,
appeared
to
recognize
no
meaningful
distinction
between
these
decisions
and
case
at
bar,
and
therefore,
urged
that
wade
and
gilbert
be
overruled.
it
is
certainly
our
position
that
wade
and
gilbert
were
rightly
decided.
petitioner
should
have
been
advised
of
its
right
to
counsel
in
this
case.
he
had
been
at
the
police
station,
several
hours,
the
alleged
crime
had
occurred
two
days
previously.
the
state
points
no
evidence
or
to
no
prejudice
that
it
would
suffered
had
counsel
been
appointed.
indeed,
illinois
statute
provides
that
an
accused
is
entitled
to
counsel
--
to
consult
with
counsel
immediately
after
being
arrested.
beginning
with
powell
versus
alabama,
this
court
has
consistently
held
that
counsel
is
required
at
all
criminal
stages
and
the
criminal
process.
in
wade,
this
court
reviewed
the
espy
of
the
sixth
amendment
and
found
that
counsel
is
necessary
to
assure
the
accused
a
meaningful
defense,
so
that
the
accused
shall
not
be
required
to
stand
alone
at
any
critical
stage
in
the
criminal
process.
recognizing
the
vagaries
of
identification
testimony,
the
court
realized
that
for
all
practical
purposes
that
accused
guilt
maybe
determined
prior
to
trial.
the
court
therefore,
held
an
identification
confrontation
is
a
critical
stage
and
that
the
accused
is
as
much
entitled
to
counsel
at
that
stage,
as
he
is
at
the
trial
itself.
now,
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
has
held
that
counsel
is
only
required
at
post
indictment
lineups.
we
submit
that
this
rule
exults
form
over
substance
and
makes
an
accused
rights
depend
upon
the
timing
of
the
identification
confrontation.
furthermore,
we
think
the
illinois
rule
allows
the
police
to
circumvent
wade
by
holding
all
identification
confrontations
prior
to
indictment.
i
think
this
court
would
probably
be
in
good
company
if
it
decided
to
overrule
the
illinois
rule,
in
fact
all
of
the
federal
courts
--
lower
federal
courts
and
the
majority
except
five
--
the
state
court
that
held
that
the
pre-indictment,
post-indictment
distinction
is
meaningless.
this
court
recognized
that
identification
confrontation
maybe
surrounded
with
suggested
influences
and
we
submit
that
these
suggestive
influences
may
occur
either
prior
or
after
indictment.
the
return
of
an
indictment
has
really
no
relationship
to
the
problems
with
which
this
court
was
involved
with
in
wade.
mr.
michael
p.
seng
that
is
right
your
honor,
the
state
makes
no
arguments,
so
far
as
i
can
see
that
wade
is
impossible
to
apply.
it
makes
--
this
argument
basically
is
the
fact
that
counsel
performs
no
meaningful
function
at
the
identification
confrontation.
this
court
held
in
wade
that
counsel’s
presents
will
avert
prejudice
and
will
assure
a
meaningful
confrontation
at
the
trial.
i
think
just
taking
the
facts
of
this
case,
one
can
readily
see
that
counsel
would
have
had
a
function.
first
of
all,
counsel
probably
would
have
objected
to
the
fact
that
these
men
were
seated
between
two
police
officers,
but
when
the
victim
came
into
the
room
that
he
was
directly
asked
to
point
out
the
accused.
mr.
michael
p.
seng
yes,
that
is
right.
mr.
michael
p.
seng
yes
your
honors.
mr.
michael
p.
seng
right.
this
is
the
state
--
mr.
michael
p.
seng
counsel,
probably
had
he
been
there,
would
have
requested
that
the
men
be
put
in
a
lineup.
now,
the
state
argues
that
the
police
will
not
cooperate
with
counsel
or
even
if
counsel
is
present,
the
police
will
employ
suggestive
procedures
outside
the
presence
of
counsel.
it
is
our
position
that
after
all
the
police
have
no
interest
in
convicting
an
innocent
man
that
if
counsel
is
present
and
suggest
their
procedures
that
the
police
probably
will
cooperate.
even
if
counsel’s
presence
is
restricted
to
a
passive
role,
we
think
that
his
mere
presence
will
induce
the
police
to
be
more
careful
and
specially,
in
this
case,
there
was
some
conflicting
testimony
at
the
trial,
as
to
what
actually
happened
whether
indeed
shard
even
recognized
the
men
when
he
first
entered
the
room
--
mr.
michael
p.
seng
that
is
right
your
honor,
is
that
--
mr.
michael
p.
seng
no
your
honor.
the
state
in
its
brief
at
least
seems
to
argue
that
this
court
should
concentrate
more
on
procedures
than
on
the
right
to
counsel,
but
illinois
has
adopted
no
procedures,
which
would
bring
your
statements
in
wade
into
affect
that.
mr.
michael
p.
seng
this
is
on
gilbert;
it
is
a
state
case
--
mr.
michael
p.
seng
right,
in
fact,
in
the
direct
testimony
the
witness
was
directly
asked
by
the
prosecutor,
“are
these
the
men
you
identified
at
the
police
station?”
mr.
michael
p.
seng
right
your
honor.
mr.
michael
p.
seng
right.
mr.
michael
p.
seng
that
is
the
only
ground,
your
honor.
and
before
this
case
was
argued
in
the
--
mr.
michael
p.
seng
this
case
was
decided
by
the
illinois
appellate
court
and
prior
to
this
case,
the
illinois
supreme
court
had
ruled
on
people
versus
palmer,
the
counsel
had
not
required
that
the
pre-indictment
lineup,
so
that
illinois
appellate
court
mainly
relied
upon
the
illinois
supreme
court’s
judgment.
the
illinois
supreme
court’s
opinion
is
very
brief
in
this
case.
it
is
just
simply
states
that
they
are
going
to
hold
wade
and
gilbert
to
its
narrow
aspect
and
that
is
to
post
indictment
situation
--
mr.
michael
p.
seng
normally,
yes.
the
complaint,
it
is
--
mr.
michael
p.
seng
right.
mr.
michael
p.
seng
yes.
well,
i
do
not
think
from
the
record
that
probably
a
complaint
had
been
filed
yet.
there
is
no
evidence
--
mr.
michael
p.
seng
this
was
argued
in
the
illinois
appellate
court.
now,
i
think
it
is
significant
that
in
the
state’s
brief
in
this
court,
state,
for
the
first
time
state
that
kirby
was
arrested
on
suspicion.
now,
with
our
position
in
the
illinois
appellate
court
that
if
he
was
arrested
on
suspicion,
that
that
would
not
be
a
probable
cause
and
i
think
if
the
state
had
taken
that
position
in
the
illinois
appellate
court,
the
appellate
court
might
have
done
the
same
thing
that
it
did
in
the
companion
case
of
being
whether
it
was
held
there
was
no
probable
cause
for
the
arrest
of
peddlers
the
identification
on
that
ground.
it
is
our
position
that
function
of
counsel,
fb
identification
will
aid
in
the
administration
of
justice.
if
the
accused
is
innocent,
it
will
aid
in
establishing
his
innocence.
if
he
is
guilty
by
having
counsel
at
the
identification
at
the
earliest
opportunity,
it
will
--
i
think
as
this
court
recognized
in
wade
it
will
help
remove
the
taint
from
the
prosecution's
evidence
and
maybe
foreclose
many
of
the
arguments
at
trial
and
post-trial
motions
that
were
brought
up
in
this
case.
furthermore,
i
do
not
think
requiring
counsel
at
pre-indictment
show-ups,
in
any
way
will
be
laid
at
confrontation.
the
state
points
no
empirical
evidence,
that
this
is
so
in
any
of
the
majority
of
jurisdictions,
which
require
counsel.
mr.
michael
p.
seng
that
is
not
involved
in
this
case
your
honor.
mr.
michael
p.
seng
no.
the
majority
of
states
have
recognized
an
exception
for
immediate
on-the-scene
confrontations,
but
that
really
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
p.
seng
not
on
the
facts
of
this
case
your
honor.
no.
i
do
not
want
to
preclude
in
argument
an
another
case,
so
the
court,
the
distinction
the
majority
of
courts
have
made
is
the
preempt
immediate
on-the-scene
confrontation
that
any
other
counsel
maybe
accused
in
that
situation
but
beyond
that,
then
counsel
is
required.
mr.
michael
p.
seng
right.
mr.
michael
p.
seng
in
this
case,
they
had
been
arrested.
they
were
at
the
police
station.
the
crime
had
occurred
two
days
previously.
mr.
michael
p.
seng
i
think
in
this
case
that,
that
would
be
improper
to
where
the
crime
had
occurred
several
days,
previously
and
where
there
were
no
compelling
circumstances
--
mr.
michael
p.
seng
that
would
create
some
problems
in
my
mind.(voice
overlap)
mr.
michael
p.
seng
well,
i
do
no
think
that
has
to
be
decided
in
this
case,
but
i
think
my
own
feeling
is
that
if
the
police
had
done
this,
this
would
be
a
situation
where
probably
they
should
call
the
man
to
the
police
station
and
give
him
the
procedures
around
--
mr.
michael
p.
seng
i
do
not
really
see
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
in
a
procedure
like
that,
unless
there
are
compelling
circumstances
or
something
like
that.
i
think
very
possibly
that
the
police
could
inform
the
accused
that
he
had
a
right
to
counsel
in
that
situation.
the
court
in
wade
seems
to
indicate
that
an
accused,
can
waive
the
right
to
counsel
too
and
i
would
imagine
that
would
be
a
question
in
their
state
procedures
as
to
how
he
would
waive,
but
i
am
not
sure
but
--
mr.
michael
p.
seng
well,
i
do
not
think
the
rule
would
go
and
that
they
would
be
required
to
get
a
lawyer
or
anything
like
that.
i
think
it
is
just
that
--
mr.
michael
p.
seng
yes
your
honor,
but
i
think
the
court
is
--
mr.
michael
p.
seng
well,
i
would
suggest
that
probably
in
a
situation
like
that,
that
maybe
the
police
should
have
not
taken
the
witnesses
right
to
that
man
initially.
there
is
a
--
mr.
michael
p.
seng
under
this
court's
ruling
in
wade,
if
direct
evidence
of
the
confrontation
was
not
admitted
in
trial,
i
think
there
would
have
to
be
a
hearing
that
this
identification
confrontation
was
by
independent
evidence
of
the
identification.
mr.
michael
p.
seng
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
michael
p.
seng
not
really
your
honor,
they
were
stopped
because
they
resembled
another
man
between
the
times
they
were
stopped
and
the
times
they
were
taken
to
the
police
station,
the
officers
found
these
traveler’s
checks
and
identifications
--
mr.
michael
p.
seng
no
and
that
there
is
no
issue
made
of
that
in
this
case
that
they
had
any
belief.
mr.
michael
p.
seng
no.
mr.
michael
p.
seng
that
is
right
your
honor.
and
i
think
that
is
really
all
that
this
court
has
to
decide
in
this
case,
really.
because
if
they
were
in
custody,
they
had
been
there
for
several
hours
and
the
crime
had
occurred
two
days
previously.
i
would
just
like
to
summarize
by
stating
that
it
is
our
position
that
wade
is
rightly
decided
that
these
are
very
--
the
right
to
counsel
is
a
fundamental
right
that
the
illinois
pre-indictment
post
-indictment
distinction
really
is
not
a
meaningful
rule
when
your
are
considering
the
rationale
for
this
court’s
decision
in
wade
and
therefore,
we
would
respectfully
urge
that
this
decision
be
reversed.
mr.
michael
p.
seng
mr.
chief
justice,
and
if
please
the
court,
if
it
is
satisfactory
with
the
court,
i
would
like
to
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
response
to
the
state
of
illinois
and
the
state
of
california.
mr.
michael
p.
seng
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
presented
in
this
case
is
narrow.
this
court
granted
cert
on
whether
due

several
hours
after

hours
after
the
alleged
crime

illinois
has
held
that
counsel
is
not
required
at
any
pre-indictment
show-up.
mr.
michael
p.
seng
we
submit
that
this
rule
is
too
broad
and
that
under
the
narrow
facts
of
this
case,
counsel
should
have
been
provided.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
not
complicated.
on
february
20th,
1968,
at
about
4:30
in
the
afternoon,
willie
shard
was
walking
down
a
street
in
chicago,
when
he
noticed
two
men
following
about
15
feet
behind
him.
he
however,
paid
no
particular
attention
to
them.
as
he
turned
to
enter
a
restaurant,
a
man
grabbed
him
from
behind,
while
another
man
took
from
his
pocket,
$30
or
$35
in
cash,
$145
in
traveler’s
checks,
his
wallet
and
all
his
identification
papers.
the
men
then
went
one
way
and
shard
went
another.
mr.
michael
p.
seng
it
was
not
until
the
next
day
that
shard
notified
the
police
and
gave
them
a
general
description
of
the
height,
weight
and
complexion
of
the
two
men.
two
days
later,
on
february
22nd,
at
about
11
in
the
morning,
thomas
kirby,
the
petitioner
in
this
action,
and
ralph
bean
were
walking
down
on
a
street
in
chicago.
at
the
same
time
two
chicago
police
officers,
the
isaac
panapinto
and
james
reesy
(ph)
were
cruising
in
a
unmarked
squad
car.
officer
panapinto
(ph)
remarked
to
his
partner
that
kirby
resembled
alfonso
hampton,
a
man
supposedly
wanted
by
the
chicago
police
for
perpetrating
a
crap
game.
the
officers
then
stopped
the
two
men.
when
asked
for
his
identification,
kirby
pulled
out
his
wallet
and
as
he
pulled
out
his
wallet,
the
officers
noticed
traveler’s
check
bearing
the
name
willie
shard.
when
asked
to
whom
these
checks
belonged,
kirby
responded
that
they
were
play
money
or
that
he
had
won
them
in
a
crap
game,
the
officers
then
searched
bean
and
found
identification
papers
bearing
the
name
willie
shard.
mr.
michael
p.
seng
no,
they
did
not
your
honor.
it
was
not
until
after
they
returned
to
the
police
station
and
had
checked
police
records
that
the
officers
first
learned
that
this
robbery
and
that
fact
is
i
think
it
is
incontestable
in
this
matter.
mr.
michael
p.
seng
that
is
possible
your
honor.
we
argued
probable
cause
for
arrest
in
the
illinois
appellate
court
--(voice
overlap)
when
the
men
were
taken
to
the
police
station,
the
officer,
after
learning
that
willie
shard
had
been
robbed,
telephoned
shard
and
told
them
that
they
had
the
two
suspects,
whom
they
wanted
him
to
look
at.
another
officer
was
sent
to
pick
up
shard.
when
shard
arrived
at
the
police
station,
kirby
and
bean
being,
who
happened
to
be
black
proceeded
between
officers
panapinto
and
reesy
in
a
large
squad
room.
when
shard
enter
the
room,
the
officers
asked
him
if
these
were
the
two
men.
shard
responded
affirmatively.
no
lineup
was
ever
held
in
this
case,
this
was
the
only
identification
that
took
place
before
trial.
at
no
time
prior
to
this
identification
show-up
was
either
kirby
or
being
advised
of
his
right
to
counsel.
in
fact,
the
public
defender
was
not
appointed
until
approximately
7
weeks
after
their
arrest
and
8
days
after
indictment
was
returned.
prior
to
trial,
kirby’s
counsel
filed
a
pretrial
motion
to
suppress
the
identification
testimony.
this
motion
was
denied.
at
trial,
shard
testified
that
the
men
in
the
courtroom
on
that
date
were
the
men
whom
he
identified
at
the
police
station.
bean
waived
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
took
the
stand
and
testified
that
he
and
kirby
found
the
traveler’s
check,
screwing
in
an
alley
way,
several
hours
prior
to
the
time
of
their
arrest.
we
respectfully
submit
the
fifth
case
that
is
directly
controlled
by
this
court’s
decisions
in
united
states
versus
wade
and
gilbert
versus
california.
the
state,
at
least
in
its
brief,
appeared
to
recognize
no
meaningful
distinction
between
these
decisions
and
case
at
bar,
and
therefore,
urged
that
wade
and
gilbert
be
overruled.
it
is
certainly
our
position
that
wade
and
gilbert
were
rightly
decided.
petitioner
should
have
been
advised
of
its
right
to
counsel
in
this
case.
he
had
been
at
the
police
station,
several
hours,
the
alleged
crime
had
occurred
two
days
previously.
the
state
points
no
evidence
or
to
no
prejudice
that
it
would
suffered
had
counsel
been
appointed.
indeed,
illinois
statute
provides
that
an
accused
is
entitled
to
counsel
--
to
consult
with
counsel
immediately
after
being
arrested.
beginning
with
powell
versus
alabama,
this
court
has
consistently
held
that
counsel
is
required
at
all
criminal
stages
and
the
criminal
process.
in
wade,
this
court
reviewed
the
espy
of
the
sixth
amendment
and
found
that
counsel
is
necessary
to
assure
the
accused
a
meaningful
defense,
so
that
the
accused
shall
not
be
required
to
stand
alone
at
any
critical
stage
in
the
criminal
process.
recognizing
the
vagaries
of
identification
testimony,
the
court
realized
that
for
all
practical
purposes
that
accused
guilt
maybe
determined
prior
to
trial.
the
court
therefore,
held
an
identification
confrontation
is
a
critical
stage
and
that
the
accused
is
as
much
entitled
to
counsel
at
that
stage,
as
he
is
at
the
trial
itself.
now,
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
has
held
that
counsel
is
only
required
at
post
indictment
lineups.
we
submit
that
this
rule
exults
form
over
substance
and
makes
an
accused
rights
depend
upon
the
timing
of
the
identification
confrontation.
furthermore,
we
think
the
illinois
rule
allows
the
police
to
circumvent
wade
by
holding
all
identification
confrontations
prior
to
indictment.
i
think
this
court
would
probably
be
in
good
company
if
it
decided
to
overrule
the
illinois
rule,
in
fact
all
of
the
federal
courts
--
lower
federal
courts
and
the
majority
except
five
--
the
state
court
that
held
that
the
pre-indictment,
post-indictment
distinction
is
meaningless.
this
court
recognized
that
identification
confrontation
maybe
surrounded
with
suggested
influences
and
we
submit
that
these
suggestive
influences
may
occur
either
prior
or
after
indictment.
the
return
of
an
indictment
has
really
no
relationship
to
the
problems
with
which
this
court
was
involved
with
in
wade.
mr.
michael
p.
seng
that
is
right
your
honor,
the
state
makes
no
arguments,
so
far
as
i
can
see
that
wade
is
impossible
to
apply.
it
makes
--
this
argument
basically
is
the
fact
that
counsel
performs
no
meaningful
function
at
the
identification
confrontation.
this
court
held
in
wade
that
counsel’s
presents
will
avert
prejudice
and
will
assure
a
meaningful
confrontation
at
the
trial.
i
think
just
taking
the
facts
of
this
case,
one
can
readily
see
that
counsel
would
have
had
a
function.
first
of
all,
counsel
probably
would
have
objected
to
the
fact
that
these
men
were
seated
between
two
police
officers,
but
when
the
victim
came
into
the
room
that
he
was
directly
asked
to
point
out
the
accused.
mr.
michael
p.
seng
yes,
that
is
right.
mr.
michael
p.
seng
yes
your
honors.
mr.
michael
p.
seng
right.
this
is
the
state
--
mr.
michael
p.
seng
counsel,
probably
had
he
been
there,
would
have
requested
that
the
men
be
put
in
a
lineup.
now,
the
state
argues
that
the
police
will
not
cooperate
with
counsel
or
even
if
counsel
is
present,
the
police
will
employ
suggestive
procedures
outside
the
presence
of
counsel.
it
is
our
position
that
after
all
the
police
have
no
interest
in
convicting
an
innocent
man
that
if
counsel
is
present
and
suggest
their
procedures
that
the
police
probably
will
cooperate.
even
if
counsel’s
presence
is
restricted
to
a
passive
role,
we
think
that
his
mere
presence
will
induce
the
police
to
be
more
careful
and
specially,
in
this
case,
there
was
some
conflicting
testimony
at
the
trial,
as
to
what
actually
happened
whether
indeed
shard
even
recognized
the
men
when
he
first
entered
the
room
--
mr.
michael
p.
seng
that
is
right
your
honor,
is
that
--
mr.
michael
p.
seng
no
your
honor.
the
state
in
its
brief
at
least
seems
to
argue
that
this
court
should
concentrate
more
on
procedures
than
on
the
right
to
counsel,
but
illinois
has
adopted
no
procedures,
which
would
bring
your
statements
in
wade
into
affect
that.
mr.
michael
p.
seng
this
is
on
gilbert;
it
is
a
state
case
--
mr.
michael
p.
seng
right,
in
fact,
in
the
direct
testimony
the
witness
was
directly
asked
by
the
prosecutor,
“are
these
the
men
you
identified
at
the
police
station?”
mr.
michael
p.
seng
right
your
honor.
mr.
michael
p.
seng
right.
mr.
michael
p.
seng
that
is
the
only
ground,
your
honor.
and
before
this
case
was
argued
in
the
--
mr.
michael
p.
seng
this
case
was
decided
by
the
illinois
appellate
court
and
prior
to
this
case,
the
illinois
supreme
court
had
ruled
on
people
versus
palmer,
the
counsel
had
not
required
that
the
pre-indictment
lineup,
so
that
illinois
appellate
court
mainly
relied
upon
the
illinois
supreme
court’s
judgment.
the
illinois
supreme
court’s
opinion
is
very
brief
in
this
case.
it
is
just
simply
states
that
they
are
going
to
hold
wade
and
gilbert
to
its
narrow
aspect
and
that
is
to
post
indictment
situation
--
mr.
michael
p.
seng
normally,
yes.
the
complaint,
it
is
--
mr.
michael
p.
seng
right.
mr.
michael
p.
seng
yes.
well,
i
do
not
think
from
the
record
that
probably
a
complaint
had
been
filed
yet.
there
is
no
evidence
--
mr.
michael
p.
seng
this
was
argued
in
the
illinois
appellate
court.
now,
i
think
it
is
significant
that
in
the
state’s
brief
in
this
court,
state,
for
the
first
time
state
that
kirby
was
arrested
on
suspicion.
now,
with
our
position
in
the
illinois
appellate
court
that
if
he
was
arrested
on
suspicion,
that
that
would
not
be
a
probable
cause
and
i
think
if
the
state
had
taken
that
position
in
the
illinois
appellate
court,
the
appellate
court
might
have
done
the
same
thing
that
it
did
in
the
companion
case
of
being
whether
it
was
held
there
was
no
probable
cause
for
the
arrest
of
peddlers
the
identification
on
that
ground.
it
is
our
position
that
function
of
counsel,
fb
identification
will
aid
in
the
administration
of
justice.
if
the
accused
is
innocent,
it
will
aid
in
establishing
his
innocence.
if
he
is
guilty
by
having
counsel
at
the
identification
at
the
earliest
opportunity,
it
will
--
i
think
as
this
court
recognized
in
wade
it
will
help
remove
the
taint
from
the
prosecution's
evidence
and
maybe
foreclose
many
of
the
arguments
at
trial
and
post-trial
motions
that
were
brought
up
in
this
case.
furthermore,
i
do
not
think
requiring
counsel
at
pre-indictment
show-ups,
in
any
way
will
be
laid
at
confrontation.
the
state
points
no
empirical
evidence,
that
this
is
so
in
any
of
the
majority
of
jurisdictions,
which
require
counsel.
mr.
michael
p.
seng
that
is
not
involved
in
this
case
your
honor.
mr.
michael
p.
seng
no.
the
majority
of
states
have
recognized
an
exception
for
immediate
on-the-scene
confrontations,
but
that
really
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
p.
seng
not
on
the
facts
of
this
case
your
honor.
no.
i
do
not
want
to
preclude
in
argument
an
another
case,
so
the
court,
the
distinction
the
majority
of
courts
have
made
is
the
preempt
immediate
on-the-scene
confrontation
that
any
other
counsel
maybe
accused
in
that
situation
but
beyond
that,
then
counsel
is
required.
mr.
michael
p.
seng
right.
mr.
michael
p.
seng
in
this
case,
they
had
been
arrested.
they
were
at
the
police
station.
the
crime
had
occurred
two
days
previously.
mr.
michael
p.
seng
i
think
in
this
case
that,
that
would
be
improper
to
where
the
crime
had
occurred
several
days,
previously
and
where
there
were
no
compelling
circumstances
--
mr.
michael
p.
seng
that
would
create
some
problems
in
my
mind.(voice
overlap)
mr.
michael
p.
seng
well,
i
do
no
think
that
has
to
be
decided
in
this
case,
but
i
think
my
own
feeling
is
that
if
the
police
had
done
this,
this
would
be
a
situation
where
probably
they
should
call
the
man
to
the
police
station
and
give
him
the
procedures
around
--
mr.
michael
p.
seng
i
do
not
really
see
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
in
a
procedure
like
that,
unless
there
are
compelling
circumstances
or
something
like
that.
i
think
very
possibly
that
the
police
could
inform
the
accused
that
he
had
a
right
to
counsel
in
that
situation.
the
court
in
wade
seems
to
indicate
that
an
accused,
can
waive
the
right
to
counsel
too
and
i
would
imagine
that
would
be
a
question
in
their
state
procedures
as
to
how
he
would
waive,
but
i
am
not
sure
but
--
mr.
michael
p.
seng
well,
i
do
not
think
the
rule
would
go
and
that
they
would
be
required
to
get
a
lawyer
or
anything
like
that.
i
think
it
is
just
that
--
mr.
michael
p.
seng
yes
your
honor,
but
i
think
the
court
is
--
mr.
michael
p.
seng
well,
i
would
suggest
that
probably
in
a
situation
like
that,
that
maybe
the
police
should
have
not
taken
the
witnesses
right
to
that
man
initially.
there
is
a
--
mr.
michael
p.
seng
under
this
court's
ruling
in
wade,
if
direct
evidence
of
the
confrontation
was
not
admitted
in
trial,
i
think
there
would
have
to
be
a
hearing
that
this
identification
confrontation
was
by
independent
evidence
of
the
identification.
mr.
michael
p.
seng
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
michael
p.
seng
not
really
your
honor,
they
were
stopped
because
they
resembled
another
man
between
the
times
they
were
stopped
and
the
times
they
were
taken
to
the
police
station,
the
officers
found
these
traveler’s
checks
and
identifications
--
mr.
michael
p.
seng
no
and
that
there
is
no
issue
made
of
that
in
this
case
that
they
had
any
belief.
mr.
michael
p.
seng
no.
mr.
michael
p.
seng
that
is
right
your
honor.
and
i
think
that
is
really
all
that
this
court
has
to
decide
in
this
case,
really.
because
if
they
were
in
custody,
they
had
been
there
for
several
hours
and
the
crime
had
occurred
two
days
previously.
i
would
just
like
to
summarize
by
stating
that
it
is
our
position
that
wade
is
rightly
decided
that
these
are
very
--
the
right
to
counsel
is
a
fundamental
right
that
the
illinois
pre-indictment
post
-indictment
distinction
really
is
not
a
meaningful
rule
when
your
are
considering
the
rationale
for
this
court’s
decision
in
wade
and
therefore,
we
would
respectfully
urge
that
this
decision
be
reversed.
mr.
michael
p.
seng
mr.
chief
justice,
and
if
please
the
court,
if
it
is
satisfactory
with
the
court,
i
would
like
to
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
response
to
the
state
of
illinois
and
the
state
of
california.
