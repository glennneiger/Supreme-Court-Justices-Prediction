justice
byron
r.
white
so
far
mr.
zagel,
you've
indicated
that
in
your
view
the
wade-
gilbert
rule
isn't
very
effective
to
solve
the
problem
at
which
it
was
aimed
but
is
having
counsel
lineup
harmful
to
defendants
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
have
any
information
about
what
impact
wade
and
gilbert
had
in
illinois
on
police
practices,
identification
practices,
maybe
true
that
the
counsel
has
a
limited
role
of
the
lineup
but
he
is
there
and
have
the
cases
had
an
impact
on
the
lineup
practices?
are
there
fewer
show
ups,
are
there
more?
what
you
would
call
fair
lineups
or
fewer
what
somebody
might
claim
or
unfair
lineups
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
taking
that
alternative
ground
that
in
any
event
it
isn't
applicable
to
pre-indictment
lineups?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
stand
on
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
a
majority
of
the
court
felt
that
wade
and
gilbert
applied
to
pre-indictment
lineups,
then
we
do
have
to
reach
your
position
of
wade
and
gilbert.
should
we
reconsider?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
otherwise?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
after
the
counsel
wasn't
allowed
in
to
listen
to
what
the
witnesses
said
after
they
looked
at
the
lineup?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
george
in
williams,
had
they
prosecuting
witness
made
some
statement
as
to
identification
at
the
time
of
the
lineup
and
then
the
further
statements
were
to
be
taken
afterwards?
