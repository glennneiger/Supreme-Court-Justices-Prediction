mr.
william
thank
you
your
honor.
i
just
want
to
make
several
points
in
my
closing
and
that
is,
that
this
case
is
a
very
narrow
case.
the
identification
occurred
several
hours
after
the
arrest.
the
accused
was
in
custody,
the
crime
had
occurred
two
days
previously,
there
is
no
contention
in
this
case,
but
that
the
police
had
plenty
of
time
to
advise
petitioner
of
his
rights
and
to
secure
counsel
for
him.
now,
the
sole
factor
in
illinois,
which
makes
the
right
to
counsel
attached
is
the
presence
of
the
indictment.
i
do
not
think
that
this
is
a
proper
rule.
now,
counsel
for
the
state
has
cited
several
rules
in
other
jurisdiction.
the
immediate
on-the-scene
confrontation.
the
leading
decision
in
that
area,
i
think
is
russel
v.
united
states
in
the
d.c.
circuit,
where
the
court
distinguishes
that
situation
from
a
later
confrontation
on
the
grounds
that
in
that
case
the
witness’s
memory
is
fresh
and
that
makes
the
identification
at
that
stage
very
critical
and
very
necessary.
in
this
case,
i
think
in
reading
the
record
you
have
to
say
that
the
focus
of
guilt
has
attached
to
the
accused.
he
was
under
arrest,
the
police
had
searched
police
records,
learned
of
the
robbery,
they
called
shard
to
come
down
to
the
police
station,
i
think
it
had
passed
from
the
investigatory
stage
in
to
a
specific
focus
of
guilt
upon
these
two
men
that
they
commit
this
robbery
and
i
think
that
is
the
reason
why
shard
was
called
down
to
the
police
station.
mr.
william
well,
your
honor
i
think
that
points
to
the
critical
nature
of
the
identification
in
this
case
that
was
really
what
the
state
was
relying
upon
to
convict
these
men
and
if
shard
had
not
been
able
to
identify
--
mr.
william
i
think
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
william
it
is
hard
to
speculate
your
honor,
but,
they
did
have
the
--
you
know,
the
identification
papers,
the
traveler’s
checks
on
that
person.
now,
whether
the
police
would
have
immediately
released
them,
i
really
do
not
know.
mr.
william
it
is
possible
that
the
police
might
have
charged
them
with
some
other
crime
--
but,
i
think
in
this
case
where
they
were
being
held
down
there,
whether
police
had
checked
records,
learned
of
the
robbery,
specifically
telephoned
shard,
told
him
to
come
down
to
identify
two
suspects,
that
i
think,
the
focus
is
definitely
attached
to
these
individual
there
at
that
time.
mr.
william
i
think
on
the
basis
of
human
memory,
human
frailties,
as
to
observation
that
and
i
am
not
myself
arguing
really
specifically,
i
did
not
give
my
personal
impressions
on
the
immediate,
on-the-scene
confrontation,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
in
that
situation
that
--
where
you
see
somebody
a
few
minutes
after
the
robbery,
that
your
memory
is
pretty
fresh
this
is
the
man.
mr.
william
two
days
before?
mr.
william
i
think
not
to
a
certain
extent,
but
that
would
make
a
difference
as
to
where
he
was
picked
up
whether
it
was
in
the
vicinity
or
--
mr.
william
i
think
under
the
exact
same
circumstances,
the
way
i
see
them,
that
probably,
they
should
have
taken
them
down
to
the
police
station
and
advised
him
of
his
right
to
counsel.
assuming
that
it
was
not
immediately
after
the
robbery
and
he
was
found,
say
within
a
block
or
so
running
away
or
something
like
that.
i
do
not
think
this
court
has
to
reach
this
issue
in
this
case.
he
was
under
arrest,
he
was
at
the
police
station
and
that
a
crime
in
fact,
had
it
occurred
two
years
previously.
the
state
has
not
adopted
alternatives
to
wade.
the
mention
was
made
of
photographs,
there
is
no
indication
in
this
case.
the
police
had
made
photographs
of
--
i
think
that
--
under
this
court’s
decision
in
wade
and
gilbert,
the
counsel
should
have
been
provided
in
this
case
under
the
mere
facts
given
here.
