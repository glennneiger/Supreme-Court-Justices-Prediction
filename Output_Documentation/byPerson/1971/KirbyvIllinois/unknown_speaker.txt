unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
did
these
arresting
officers
at
the
time
of
the
arrest
know
about
the
willie
shard
robbery?
unknown
speaker
so,
is
finding
the
traveler’s
checks
of
the
willie
shard,
but
was
not
in
any
way
incriminating
from
in
view
of
the
officers,
their
knowledge.
is
that
true?
i
am
just
trying
to
piece
together
this
thing.
i
mean
one
of
these
people
arrested,
the
petitioner
might
have
been
named
willie
shard,
is
that
not
correct?
unknown
speaker
but
illinois
wants
us
to
overrule
as
wade
against
the
united
states?
unknown
speaker
the
accused
were
negros?
unknown
speaker
and,
the
police
officers
are
caucasians?
unknown
speaker
and,
in
uniform?
unknown
speaker
i
meant
that
gilbert
against
california
is
the
applicable
case
here
does
--
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
chicago
police
officers?
unknown
speaker
has
that
police
department
adopted
any
regulation
if
there
were
line
up
procedure?
unknown
speaker
is
it
gilbert
or
wade?
unknown
speaker
when
there
was
reference
to
the
prior
information
that
--
unknown
speaker
so,
it
would
not
be
the
question
of
obtained
or
anything.
it
is
the
exclusion?
unknown
speaker
perfect.
unknown
speaker
and
i
gather
the
only
the
ground
that
which
gilbert
could
not
apply
was
that
this
was
a
pre-indictment
show-up
to
where
--
unknown
speaker
were
there
any
suggestion
in
the
illinois
court
that
what
for
that
fact,
gilbert
would
have
been
applied?
unknown
speaker
--
what
is
the
procedure
in
illinois,
you
arrest
someone
that
you
file
a
charge
against
them?
unknown
speaker
the
complaint
is
filed
and
then
there
is
an
indictment
later.
unknown
speaker
and
this
was
post
arrest
in
custody
post
charge.
unknown
speaker
they
were
supposed
to
arrest
and
there
is
no
challenge
by
anyone
that
there
was
a
probable
cause
to
arrest.
unknown
speaker
you
are
not
urging
a
rule
of
those,
prior
to
arrest
in
custody,
are
you?
unknown
speaker
but,
are
you
urging
the
rule
that
it
would?
unknown
speaker
and,
you
are
not
urging
a
rule
that
would
reach
those?
unknown
speaker
but
the
police
here
picked
these
phones
five
minutes
after.
unknown
speaker
and
to
that
effect,
had
brought
them
back
and
said
to
shard
this
--
at
least
they
and
that
is
a
--
unknown
speaker
or
if
there
had
not
been
any
arrest
and
they
had
taken
the
witness
around
to
where
shard
was
working
and
walking?
unknown
speaker
but
he
has
not
been
arrested?
assuming
that
he
had
not
been
arrested
and
he
just
had
work
and
they
are
trying
to
find
out
who
did
it,
they
take
a
witness
around
on
that
location.
unknown
speaker
you
really
are
pressing
to
a
rule
to
these
reach
this
pre-custody
cases
then?
unknown
speaker
not
the
con
man?
unknown
speaker
you
are
really
asking
or
more
precisely
asking
for
the
overruling
of
gilbert
v.
california,
are
you
not?
unknown
speaker
it
was
the
first
case.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
wade
was
based
directly
on
the
sixth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
and
gilbert
against
california
was
necessarily
based
on
the
fourteenth
amendment.
unknown
speaker
wade
established
the
right
of
counsel?
unknown
speaker
at
the
length
of
--
unknown
speaker
and
gilbert
has
had
the
consequences.
unknown
speaker
but
you
want
gideon
overruled
also?
unknown
speaker
but
that
was
a
matter
of
state
law?
unknown
speaker
you
maybe
getting
--
unknown
speaker
did
the
court
reversed
the
conviction
on
that
basis?
unknown
speaker
and
was
it
based
on
the
united
states
constitution?
unknown
speaker
petitioner
has
not
challenged
the
arrest
here
has
he?
unknown
speaker
we
do
not
suggest
the
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
you
would.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
--
sixth?
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
one
possible
reason
for
construing
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendments,
as
requiring
the
presence
of
counsel
in
a
lineup
is
the
sort
of
preventive
reason
with
counsel
there,
even
though
he
may
never
have
to
testify
or
never
have
to
say
anything
about
the
lineup
or
he
may
never
come
out.
but,
just
his
very
presence
may
serve
to
assure
a
fair
lineup,
is
not
that
--
have
you
considered
that
possibility?
i
do
not
notice
that
in
your
brief.
unknown
speaker
i
am
assuming,
in
my
question
that
he
will
never
testify
or
never
need
to
testify,
he
will
never
need
to
refer
to
the
lineup,
because
the
line
up
was
fairly
conducted,
because
of
his
presence?
unknown
speaker
is
not
the
photograph
of
a
lineup
a
practical
way
of
assuring
fairness?
unknown
speaker
i
was
really
going
to
ask
--
is
photography
of
lineups
in
practice
in
many
places
within
your
knowledge?
unknown
speaker
incidentally,
has
the
chicago
police
department
adopted
any
kind
of
regulations
to
ensure
fairness
of
lineup?
unknown
speaker
some
police
departments
after
the
decision
on
wade
and
gilbert,
notably,
the
new
york
city
police
department
promulgated
regulation.
unknown
speaker
elaborate
regulations,
which
were
given
wide
publicity
in
which
under
the
regulations
themselves
provide
methods
for
assuring
that
the
regulation
is
the
confinement
but,
chicago
has
not
done
anything—
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
was
shard
a
white
man
or
a
negro?

(inaudible)
