mr.
ronald
m.
george
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
california
co-
heartedly
supports
the
state
of
illinois
and
its
contentions
in
this
case
that
the
rules
established
by
the
wade
and
gilbert
decision
should
be
reconsidered
and
that
if
not
reconsidered,
these
decisions
should
at
least
be
limited
to
the
pre-indictment,
rather
post-indictment,
post-information
stage,
such
as
was
involved
in
the
wade
and
gilbert
cases
themselves.
now,
the
california
supreme
court
in
people
v.
fowler
did
in
fact
extend
the
wade-gilbert
rules
to
the
pre-indictment,
pre-information
stage.
great
many
states
have
done
so
and
that
is
why
we
have
a
particularly
acute
interest
in
urging
that
wade
and
gilbert
be
reconsidered.
now,
rather
than
reiterate
all
of
the
arguments
so
forcefully
made
by
the
state
of
illinois,
we
are
going
to
undertake
to
support
these
arguments
by
references
to
various
decisions
of
the
california
supreme
court
which
illustrate
the
problems
inherent
in
the
application
of
the
wade
and
gilbert
rules
to
the
post-indictment
or
pre-indictment
stage.
citations
to
these
california
cases
are
given
in
our
amicus
curiae
brief
and
at
the
outset
we
want
to
make
it
clear
too
that
we
do
not
in
any
way
question
or
urge
any
reconsideration
of
the
stovall
decision
which
affords
basic
due
process
protection
for
a
defendant
regardless
of
the
time
of
lineup.
california
in
fact
has
its
own
decisions
establishing
those
very
same
safeguards.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
it's
my
understanding
that
stovall
was
raised
in
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
and
was
not
and
cert
was
not
granted
or
issue.
but
we
want
to
make
it
clear,
the
limited
nature
of
our
attack
on
existing
law.
in
people
v.
fowler
case,
as
previously
indicated,
the
california
supreme
court
did
extend
the
wade-
gilbert
rule
at
pre-indictment
and
pre-information
stage
and
did
so
despite
the
following
circumstances.
the
defendant
had
surrendered
himself
to
the
police
upon
learning
of
an
outstanding
warrant
for
his
arrest.
the
lineup
took
place
on
the
same
day
as
the
arrest.
it
wasn't
a
situation
such
as
wade
and
gilbert
where
you
have
lineup
maybe
12
or
15
days
after
appointment
of
counsel.
the
defendant
had
been
asked
prior
to
the
lineup
whether
or
not
he
had
an
attorney.
although
he
was
not
told
that
he
could
have
an
attorney
appointed.
the
lineup
was
fair.
there
is
no
question
of
that
all
of
the
persons
in
the
lineup
were
male
negroes
of
approximately
the
same
age
and
height
and
there
was
also
identification
by
voice.
but
perhaps
also
significantly
the
lineup
was
conducted
in
complete
compliance
with
a
six
page
set
of
regulations
developed
by
the
oakland
police
department
to
ensure
fair
lineups.
that
six
page
set
of
regulations
is
set
forth
as
one
of
the
appendices
to
the
ucla
law
review
article
which
we
cite
and
which
respondent,
state
of
illinois
cites.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no.
in
the
fowler
case,
no.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no,
no.
nothing
at
all.
the
court
there
plainly
rejected
mr.
justice
brennan's
suggestion
in
wade
that
certain
regulations
could
ensure
a
fair
lineup
that
there
was
no
constitutional
straitjacket,
that
this
was
just
a
method
of
implementing
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
defendant.
they
said
in
effect
that
the
only
thing
that
would
substitute
would
be
something
such
as
a
video
tape,
that
would
be
a
complete
reproduction
of
the
lineup.
now
in
people
versus
martin,
the
wade-gilbert
rules
were
extended
by
the
california
supreme
court
to
the
pre-arrest
stage,
and
it
was
a
voluntary
pre-arrest
show
up.
the
defendant
was
stopped
and
voluntarily
accompanied
the
police
to
the
station
for
the
expressed
purpose
of
a
viewing
by
the
robbery
victim.
and
there
the
victim
viewed
the
defendant
alone
with
an
officer
through
a
one
way
mirror,
made
an
identification,
and
then
after
that
the
defendant
was
arrested
and
despite
that
wade,
gilbert
was
held
to
apply.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well
yes
but
there
the
rules
were
applied
as
far
as
the
right
to
counsel
rather
than
an
mere
attack
on
unfairness.
the
court
held
that
there
was
a
need
of
advice
and
waiver
of
counsel.
and
in
regard
to
that
problem
of
waiver
there
are
some
interesting
decisions
from
the
california
supreme
court
which
to
me
do
not
appear
entirely
consistent,
in
people
versus
banks
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
certainly.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes,
all
of
the
decisions
that
i
called
at
the
court's
attention
are
grounded
squarely
on
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no
it
was
not.
most
of
these
decisions
were
divided
decisions,
but
as
not
always
closely
divided,
but
i
don't
think
any
of
them
were
unanimous.
in
this
problem
of
waiver
we
have
the
banks,
people
versus
banks
decision
where
the
california
supreme
court
held
that
an
effective
waiver
of
miranda
rights
upon
interrogation
did
not
waive
the
right
to
counsel
at
a
lineup
that
was
conducted
the
same
day.
even
though
at
that
line
up,
the
defendant
was
asked,
was
told
that
he
had
the
right
to
meet
an
attorney,
but
he
wasn't
given
a
full
miranda
type
warning
at
that
lineup,
the
same
day.
he
wasn't
told
that
an
attorney
would
be
appointed
at
the
lineup,
but
he
was
given
the
miranda
warning
earlier,
and
told
that
he
had
the
right
to
attorney
at
the
lineup
but
that
wasn't
sufficient.
and
yet
in
people
versus
tribble
the
california
supreme
court
held
that
in
order
for
a
waiver
to
be
effective,
the
defendant
need
not
be
informed
that
the
purpose
of
the
lineup
is
possible
identification
by
the
victim,
but
utmost
troubling
at
all
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no,
it
did
not
suggest,
we
weren't
favored
with
any
sort
of
guidance
from
the
court
on
that.
in
fact
that's
the
most
striking
thing
in
fowler
opinion
and
some
of
these
other
decisions
that
the
court
explicitly
states
there
is
so
many
troubling
and
vague
areas
under
wade
and
gilbert,
but
it
is
for
some
future
time
for
us
to
know
what
to
do,
and
they
don't
give
you
any
guidelines
that's
the
problem.
i
think
that's
symptomatic
that
a
lot
of
the
uncertainty
which
wade
and
gilbert
have
caused
upon
the
lower
courts,
and
this
is
upon
the
california
supreme
court
one
can
imagine
it
upon
the
trial
court
level,
a
fortiori.
but
most
troubling
of
all
is
this
problem
of
the
role
of
an
effective
attorney
at
the
lineup,
and
as
mr.
zagel
indicated
this
people
versus
williams
case
is
a
graphic
illustration.
there
the
attorney
did
take
the
stand,
and
testify
that
the
lineup
was
arranged
fairly
and
with
no
suggestiveness
as
to
the
identity
of
the
suspect.
however
the
attorney
wanted
to
accompany
the
police
officers
into
the
interrogation
room
at
which
time
the
witnesses
to
the
crime
would
be
further
interrogated
as
to
identification,
and
the
defendant
was
not
to
be
present
at
that
confrontation.
but
the
california
supreme
court,
said
that
not
withstanding
the
submittedly
fair
lineup,
the
police
failure
to
allow
the
attorney
into
the
interrogation
room
required
reversal
of
the
judgment
because
of
right
to
counsel
being
denied.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
people
versus
williams
that
is
fully
cited
in
our
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes,
they
did.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that's
right,
the
attorney
saw
the
lineup
which
he
testified
was
completely
fair
and
then
the
witnesses
were
taken
into
a
room,
and
were
to
be
questioned
by
the
officer
about
various
things
including
the
identification
of
the
suspect.
and
the
attorney
felt
that
he
has
the
right
to
be
in
their
and
that
was
the
basis
for
the
reversal
of
the
judgment
in
fact
that
with
request
was
denied.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well,
i
think
wade
and
gilbert
says
that
he
has
a
right
to
go
in
there.
i
certainly
would
argue
that
it
doesn't
but
the
point
is
that
the
decisions
frankly
provide
so
little
guidance
that
courts
are
free
to
reach.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
would
be
pleased,
or
i
wouldn't
be
satisfied,
i
think
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well
i
think
that
this
is
an
appropriate
time
for
the
court
to
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
but
if
wade
and
gilbert
don't
apply
to
the
pre-indictment
or
post-indictment
level,
then
of
course
it
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well
they
show
up
though,
there
have
been
instances
where
wade
and
gilbert
are
applied
by
lower
courts
to
show
up.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
five
men
in
a
row
apparently
for
the
lower
courts
to
feel
that
wade
and
gilbert
must
be
invoked,
and
i
don't
think
those
decisions
expressively
limit
themselves
to
any
particular
format
of
lineup
or
show
up
or
other
identification.
and
what
i
think
is
so
important
to
ask
is
what
would
the
presence
of
the
attorney
due
to
ensured
fairness
of
the
trial
that
would
not
be
accomplished
by
effective
cross
examination
of
the
witnesses
of
trial.
you
can
imagine
the
next
extension
of
this
williams
rationale
to
have
the
attorney
in
the
squad
room,
in
the
squad
car,
or
at
the
on
the
scene
confrontation
hindering
possible
police
investigation.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
believe
there
was
no
such
identification.
in
fact
most
of
the
commentators
who
suggest
rules
of
fairness
suggest
that
the
witness
not
make
an
identification
in
the
presence
of
other
witnesses
and
that
this
be
left
later.
so
i
think
that
what's
so
important
here
is
to
realize
the
vast
difference
between
the
function
of
counsel
at
a
lineup,
and
its
function
at
an
interrogation.
in
a
miranda
situation
at
least,
the
attorney
can
do
something
effective
with
respect
to
the
defendant's
rights.
he
can
tell
him
be
quite,
we
have
a
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
he
can't
do
anything
of
that
sort
at
a
lineup
because
as
schmerber
and
wade
teach
us,
there
is
no
right
to
withhold
oneself
from
display
for
identification
purposes.
and
that
were
not
to
be
sold
and
indeed,
one
would
have
to
think
that
counsel
would
have
to
be
present
at
a
blood
test,
at
all
sorts
of
various
pre-identification
procedures.
now
counsel
has
no
right
to
assume
the
role
of
a
stage
director,
and
casting
the
parts
to
be
played
or
the
stances
to
be
assumed,
or
the
phrases
to
be
uttered
in
this
lineup
production.
he
can't
stop
the
conduct
of
an
unfair
lineup,
all
he
can
do
is
be
an
observer
and
a
very
poor
witness,
a
contrary
to
professional
ethics
which
indicate
he
should
not
be
a
witness
for
his
plan.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no,
but
of
course
this
would
cause
great
complication,
what
if
it's
a
post-indictment
client,
he
is
representing
his
client
who
really
have
to
higher
somebody
else
to
be
there.
it
certainly
is
a
cumbersome
method,
i
think
without
any
great
advantage
to
the
defendant
and
in
williams,
the
attorney
did
have
to
take
the
stand.
as
mr.
zagel
indicated
what
can
counsel
do
to
effectively
serve
the
purpose
of
obtaining
its
client's
acquittal,
and
by
preventing
identification
he
can
urge
the
defendant
to
alter
his
physical
appearance,
the
ucla
article
there
indicates
instances
in
which
a
mustache
was
shaved
off,
the
hair
was
cut,
voice
was
disguised.
he
can
do
these
things
which
are
suggestive
as
far
as
other
person
is
in
the
lineup
and
which
may
in
fact
be
unfair
to
the
other
persons
by
representing
his
client
and
he
can
intimidate
other
witnesses
who
have
appeared
to
identify
the
defendant.
and
this
of
course
uses
up
a
lot
of
time
and
energies
of
the
police
having
the
attorney
there
without
really
doing
anything
for
the
defendant.
now
what
i
would
like
to
indicate
to
is
we've
talked
about
the
effect
of
the
wade
and
gilbert
rules
on
guilty
suspects
but
let's
consider
what
is
the
effect
on
innocent
suspects.
the
innocent
suspect
in
particular
has
a
common
non-adversary
interest
with
the
police.
he
wants
to
have
an
expeditiously
conducted
lineup
which
may
bring
about
his
release
from
custody.
if
somebody
has
to
delay
a
lineup
like
here
it
was
one
or
two
hours
after
the
arrest.
well,
where
are
they
going
to
get
a
lawyer?
so
to
mean
that
perhaps
the
innocence
suspect
is
kept
in
custody
for
another
day
or
two
while
they
hunt
around
for
a
lawyer
and
then
it's
released
when
he
is
not
identified.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well,
there
is
some
movement
in
los
angles
to
have
public
defenders
available
on
call
but
this
is
the
thing
that
varies
very
much
from
city
to
city.
there
isn't
any
statewide
policy.
in
fact,
i
don't
think
you
could
have
a
statewide
policy.
it's
matter
of
each
jurisdiction.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
they
had
some
attorneys
who
will
show
up
at
the
lineup
and
see
that
perhaps
certain
procedures
are
called
and
if
they
are
not
then
take
the
witness
stand
but
they
can
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes,
that's
my
understanding
that
they
are
sort
of
as
an
observer
which
points
out
of
course
the
curious
role
of
counsel,
a
very
uncustomary
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes,
he
would
in
that
sense
i
don't
--
i
haven't
heard
of
them
since
where
they
will
send
somebody
to
represent
each
person.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that's
been
my
understanding
but
i
don't
want
to
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that's
been
my
understanding
but
i
just
have
this
on
what
i
have
been
told.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
certainly
and
one
can
imagine
if
the
court
remembers
the
line
up
in
gilbert
case
where
there
was
an
auditorium
formed.
there
was
a
parade
after
parade,
if
there
had
to
be
one
attorney
for
every
man
put
on
the
stagethere,
it
would
be
mammoth
production
indeed
which
would
drain
the
resources
of
the
county
bar
in
the
public
defender's
office.
the
way
you
described
that
one
situation,
the
counsel
would
be
quasi-magistrate,
would
he
not?
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes,
in
effect
he
would.
he
wouldn't
be
performing
as
traditional
task
of
representing
one
client
that
he'd
be
trying
to
perhaps
evaluate
the
competing
interest
of
the
various
persons
under
suspicion
at
that
time.
while
all
of
this
is
being
arranged
of
course
counsel,
the
counsel
is
there,
this
is
being
obtained,
the
guilty
suspect
might
be
putting
more
time
and
distance
between
himself
and
the
police
when
they
think
that
they
have
a
probable
suspect.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
paid
lawyers?
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well,paid
lawyers
might
be
there
but
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no,
there
are
paid
lawyers
but
i
think
in
this
situation
you
so
often
have
the
man
who
does
not
have
an
attorney.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no,
nobody
could
do
very
much
i
think.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
and
certainly
this
isn't
the
type
of
thing,
few
people
find
it
easy
to
employ
an
attorney
for
their
trial
as
it
is,
if
you
have
to
hire
your
attorney
to
sit
around
at
a
big
show
up
all
day,
there
are
going
to
be
more
people
who
meet
the
standards
of
indigency
i
think.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
may
i
have
an
extra
minute
or
two
to
wrap
up
in
detail.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
thank
you.
now,
i
would
like
to
indicate
too
that
what
can
an
attorney's
presence
accomplish
that
could
not
be
accomplished
well
or
better
by
cross
examination
in
conjunction
with
a
photograph,
perhaps
with
a
tape
recording
or
video
tape
of
the
whole
processes.
then
in
people
versus
lawrence,
the
california
supreme
court
did
uphold
the
showing
of
a
photograph
of
a
lineup
to
the
victim
in
the
absence
of
counsel
even
though
the
defendant
had
previously
retained
counsel.
on
the
theory
that
had
the
police
cut
out
the
faces
from
this
photograph
of
the
line
up
that
these
mug
shots
could
have
been
used.
but
that
here
there
was
no
confrontation
between
the
suspect
directly
and
his
accuser.
so
this
shows
some
of
the
conflicts
because
if
confrontation
is
really
the
basic
issue
then
why
did
the
court
in
williams
say
that
the
attorney
had
the
right
to
go
into
the
squad
room
when
the
defendant
wasn't
even
there
with
the
witness.
now,
basically
if
petitioner
kirby
had
the
right
to
have
appointed
counsel
at
the
show
up
in
a
couple
of
hours
after
his
arrest.
i
think
trial
courts
and
appellate
courts
in
the
states
would
be
very
hard
pressed
to
decide
to
draw
any
recent
distinction
as
to
when
counsel
can
be
had
when
if
it
can
not
be
had
at
beyond
the
scene
confrontation
or
whatever.
well,
perhaps
attractive
on
a
purely
theoretical
level,
the
rules
requiring
counsel
at
identification
confrontations
have
presented
these
numerous
practical
difficulties
in
their
application.
difficulties
which
were
perhaps
unforeseeable
at
the
time
wade
and
gilbert
came
down.
in
light
of
the
present
experience,
we
submit
that
this
court
should
overrule
its
experiment
of
four
years
the
wade
and
gilbert
rules.
you
have
to
ask
in
the
end,
what
could
counsel
have
done
for
kirby?
what
difference
would
there
have
been?
i
think
when
you
ask
those
questions
it's
clear
that
counsel
accomplished
nothing.
so
we
urge
the
overruling
of
wade
and
gilbert
on
those
grounds.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
california
co-
heartedly
supports
the
state
of
illinois
and
its
contentions
in
this
case
that
the
rules
established
by
the
wade
and
gilbert
decision
should
be
reconsidered
and
that
if
not
reconsidered,
these
decisions
should
at
least
be
limited
to
the
pre-indictment,
rather
post-indictment,
post-information
stage,
such
as
was
involved
in
the
wade
and
gilbert
cases
themselves.
now,
the
california
supreme
court
in
people
v.
fowler
did
in
fact
extend
the
wade-gilbert
rules
to
the
pre-indictment,
pre-information
stage.
great
many
states
have
done
so
and
that
is
why
we
have
a
particularly
acute
interest
in
urging
that
wade
and
gilbert
be
reconsidered.
now,
rather
than
reiterate
all
of
the
arguments
so
forcefully
made
by
the
state
of
illinois,
we
are
going
to
undertake
to
support
these
arguments
by
references
to
various
decisions
of
the
california
supreme
court
which
illustrate
the
problems
inherent
in
the
application
of
the
wade
and
gilbert
rules
to
the
post-indictment
or
pre-indictment
stage.
citations
to
these
california
cases
are
given
in
our
amicus
curiae
brief
and
at
the
outset
we
want
to
make
it
clear
too
that
we
do
not
in
any
way
question
or
urge
any
reconsideration
of
the
stovall
decision
which
affords
basic
due
process
protection
for
a
defendant
regardless
of
the
time
of
lineup.
california
in
fact
has
its
own
decisions
establishing
those
very
same
safeguards.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
it's
my
understanding
that
stovall
was
raised
in
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
and
was
not
and
cert
was
not
granted
or
issue.
but
we
want
to
make
it
clear,
the
limited
nature
of
our
attack
on
existing
law.
in
people
v.
fowler
case,
as
previously
indicated,
the
california
supreme
court
did
extend
the
wade-
gilbert
rule
at
pre-indictment
and
pre-information
stage
and
did
so
despite
the
following
circumstances.
the
defendant
had
surrendered
himself
to
the
police
upon
learning
of
an
outstanding
warrant
for
his
arrest.
the
lineup
took
place
on
the
same
day
as
the
arrest.
it
wasn't
a
situation
such
as
wade
and
gilbert
where
you
have
lineup
maybe
12
or
15
days
after
appointment
of
counsel.
the
defendant
had
been
asked
prior
to
the
lineup
whether
or
not
he
had
an
attorney.
although
he
was
not
told
that
he
could
have
an
attorney
appointed.
the
lineup
was
fair.
there
is
no
question
of
that
all
of
the
persons
in
the
lineup
were
male
negroes
of
approximately
the
same
age
and
height
and
there
was
also
identification
by
voice.
but
perhaps
also
significantly
the
lineup
was
conducted
in
complete
compliance
with
a
six
page
set
of
regulations
developed
by
the
oakland
police
department
to
ensure
fair
lineups.
that
six
page
set
of
regulations
is
set
forth
as
one
of
the
appendices
to
the
ucla
law
review
article
which
we
cite
and
which
respondent,
state
of
illinois
cites.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no.
in
the
fowler
case,
no.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no,
no.
nothing
at
all.
the
court
there
plainly
rejected
mr.
justice
brennan's
suggestion
in
wade
that
certain
regulations
could
ensure
a
fair
lineup
that
there
was
no
constitutional
straitjacket,
that
this
was
just
a
method
of
implementing
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
defendant.
they
said
in
effect
that
the
only
thing
that
would
substitute
would
be
something
such
as
a
video
tape,
that
would
be
a
complete
reproduction
of
the
lineup.
now
in
people
versus
martin,
the
wade-gilbert
rules
were
extended
by
the
california
supreme
court
to
the
pre-arrest
stage,
and
it
was
a
voluntary
pre-arrest
show
up.
the
defendant
was
stopped
and
voluntarily
accompanied
the
police
to
the
station
for
the
expressed
purpose
of
a
viewing
by
the
robbery
victim.
and
there
the
victim
viewed
the
defendant
alone
with
an
officer
through
a
one
way
mirror,
made
an
identification,
and
then
after
that
the
defendant
was
arrested
and
despite
that
wade,
gilbert
was
held
to
apply.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well
yes
but
there
the
rules
were
applied
as
far
as
the
right
to
counsel
rather
than
an
mere
attack
on
unfairness.
the
court
held
that
there
was
a
need
of
advice
and
waiver
of
counsel.
and
in
regard
to
that
problem
of
waiver
there
are
some
interesting
decisions
from
the
california
supreme
court
which
to
me
do
not
appear
entirely
consistent,
in
people
versus
banks
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
certainly.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes,
all
of
the
decisions
that
i
called
at
the
court's
attention
are
grounded
squarely
on
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no
it
was
not.
most
of
these
decisions
were
divided
decisions,
but
as
not
always
closely
divided,
but
i
don't
think
any
of
them
were
unanimous.
in
this
problem
of
waiver
we
have
the
banks,
people
versus
banks
decision
where
the
california
supreme
court
held
that
an
effective
waiver
of
miranda
rights
upon
interrogation
did
not
waive
the
right
to
counsel
at
a
lineup
that
was
conducted
the
same
day.
even
though
at
that
line
up,
the
defendant
was
asked,
was
told
that
he
had
the
right
to
meet
an
attorney,
but
he
wasn't
given
a
full
miranda
type
warning
at
that
lineup,
the
same
day.
he
wasn't
told
that
an
attorney
would
be
appointed
at
the
lineup,
but
he
was
given
the
miranda
warning
earlier,
and
told
that
he
had
the
right
to
attorney
at
the
lineup
but
that
wasn't
sufficient.
and
yet
in
people
versus
tribble
the
california
supreme
court
held
that
in
order
for
a
waiver
to
be
effective,
the
defendant
need
not
be
informed
that
the
purpose
of
the
lineup
is
possible
identification
by
the
victim,
but
utmost
troubling
at
all
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no,
it
did
not
suggest,
we
weren't
favored
with
any
sort
of
guidance
from
the
court
on
that.
in
fact
that's
the
most
striking
thing
in
fowler
opinion
and
some
of
these
other
decisions
that
the
court
explicitly
states
there
is
so
many
troubling
and
vague
areas
under
wade
and
gilbert,
but
it
is
for
some
future
time
for
us
to
know
what
to
do,
and
they
don't
give
you
any
guidelines
that's
the
problem.
i
think
that's
symptomatic
that
a
lot
of
the
uncertainty
which
wade
and
gilbert
have
caused
upon
the
lower
courts,
and
this
is
upon
the
california
supreme
court
one
can
imagine
it
upon
the
trial
court
level,
a
fortiori.
but
most
troubling
of
all
is
this
problem
of
the
role
of
an
effective
attorney
at
the
lineup,
and
as
mr.
zagel
indicated
this
people
versus
williams
case
is
a
graphic
illustration.
there
the
attorney
did
take
the
stand,
and
testify
that
the
lineup
was
arranged
fairly
and
with
no
suggestiveness
as
to
the
identity
of
the
suspect.
however
the
attorney
wanted
to
accompany
the
police
officers
into
the
interrogation
room
at
which
time
the
witnesses
to
the
crime
would
be
further
interrogated
as
to
identification,
and
the
defendant
was
not
to
be
present
at
that
confrontation.
but
the
california
supreme
court,
said
that
not
withstanding
the
submittedly
fair
lineup,
the
police
failure
to
allow
the
attorney
into
the
interrogation
room
required
reversal
of
the
judgment
because
of
right
to
counsel
being
denied.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
people
versus
williams
that
is
fully
cited
in
our
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes,
they
did.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that's
right,
the
attorney
saw
the
lineup
which
he
testified
was
completely
fair
and
then
the
witnesses
were
taken
into
a
room,
and
were
to
be
questioned
by
the
officer
about
various
things
including
the
identification
of
the
suspect.
and
the
attorney
felt
that
he
has
the
right
to
be
in
their
and
that
was
the
basis
for
the
reversal
of
the
judgment
in
fact
that
with
request
was
denied.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well,
i
think
wade
and
gilbert
says
that
he
has
a
right
to
go
in
there.
i
certainly
would
argue
that
it
doesn't
but
the
point
is
that
the
decisions
frankly
provide
so
little
guidance
that
courts
are
free
to
reach.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
would
be
pleased,
or
i
wouldn't
be
satisfied,
i
think
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well
i
think
that
this
is
an
appropriate
time
for
the
court
to
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
but
if
wade
and
gilbert
don't
apply
to
the
pre-indictment
or
post-indictment
level,
then
of
course
it
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well
they
show
up
though,
there
have
been
instances
where
wade
and
gilbert
are
applied
by
lower
courts
to
show
up.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
five
men
in
a
row
apparently
for
the
lower
courts
to
feel
that
wade
and
gilbert
must
be
invoked,
and
i
don't
think
those
decisions
expressively
limit
themselves
to
any
particular
format
of
lineup
or
show
up
or
other
identification.
and
what
i
think
is
so
important
to
ask
is
what
would
the
presence
of
the
attorney
due
to
ensured
fairness
of
the
trial
that
would
not
be
accomplished
by
effective
cross
examination
of
the
witnesses
of
trial.
you
can
imagine
the
next
extension
of
this
williams
rationale
to
have
the
attorney
in
the
squad
room,
in
the
squad
car,
or
at
the
on
the
scene
confrontation
hindering
possible
police
investigation.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
believe
there
was
no
such
identification.
in
fact
most
of
the
commentators
who
suggest
rules
of
fairness
suggest
that
the
witness
not
make
an
identification
in
the
presence
of
other
witnesses
and
that
this
be
left
later.
so
i
think
that
what's
so
important
here
is
to
realize
the
vast
difference
between
the
function
of
counsel
at
a
lineup,
and
its
function
at
an
interrogation.
in
a
miranda
situation
at
least,
the
attorney
can
do
something
effective
with
respect
to
the
defendant's
rights.
he
can
tell
him
be
quite,
we
have
a
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
he
can't
do
anything
of
that
sort
at
a
lineup
because
as
schmerber
and
wade
teach
us,
there
is
no
right
to
withhold
oneself
from
display
for
identification
purposes.
and
that
were
not
to
be
sold
and
indeed,
one
would
have
to
think
that
counsel
would
have
to
be
present
at
a
blood
test,
at
all
sorts
of
various
pre-identification
procedures.
now
counsel
has
no
right
to
assume
the
role
of
a
stage
director,
and
casting
the
parts
to
be
played
or
the
stances
to
be
assumed,
or
the
phrases
to
be
uttered
in
this
lineup
production.
he
can't
stop
the
conduct
of
an
unfair
lineup,
all
he
can
do
is
be
an
observer
and
a
very
poor
witness,
a
contrary
to
professional
ethics
which
indicate
he
should
not
be
a
witness
for
his
plan.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no,
but
of
course
this
would
cause
great
complication,
what
if
it's
a
post-indictment
client,
he
is
representing
his
client
who
really
have
to
higher
somebody
else
to
be
there.
it
certainly
is
a
cumbersome
method,
i
think
without
any
great
advantage
to
the
defendant
and
in
williams,
the
attorney
did
have
to
take
the
stand.
as
mr.
zagel
indicated
what
can
counsel
do
to
effectively
serve
the
purpose
of
obtaining
its
client's
acquittal,
and
by
preventing
identification
he
can
urge
the
defendant
to
alter
his
physical
appearance,
the
ucla
article
there
indicates
instances
in
which
a
mustache
was
shaved
off,
the
hair
was
cut,
voice
was
disguised.
he
can
do
these
things
which
are
suggestive
as
far
as
other
person
is
in
the
lineup
and
which
may
in
fact
be
unfair
to
the
other
persons
by
representing
his
client
and
he
can
intimidate
other
witnesses
who
have
appeared
to
identify
the
defendant.
and
this
of
course
uses
up
a
lot
of
time
and
energies
of
the
police
having
the
attorney
there
without
really
doing
anything
for
the
defendant.
now
what
i
would
like
to
indicate
to
is
we've
talked
about
the
effect
of
the
wade
and
gilbert
rules
on
guilty
suspects
but
let's
consider
what
is
the
effect
on
innocent
suspects.
the
innocent
suspect
in
particular
has
a
common
non-adversary
interest
with
the
police.
he
wants
to
have
an
expeditiously
conducted
lineup
which
may
bring
about
his
release
from
custody.
if
somebody
has
to
delay
a
lineup
like
here
it
was
one
or
two
hours
after
the
arrest.
well,
where
are
they
going
to
get
a
lawyer?
so
to
mean
that
perhaps
the
innocence
suspect
is
kept
in
custody
for
another
day
or
two
while
they
hunt
around
for
a
lawyer
and
then
it's
released
when
he
is
not
identified.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well,
there
is
some
movement
in
los
angles
to
have
public
defenders
available
on
call
but
this
is
the
thing
that
varies
very
much
from
city
to
city.
there
isn't
any
statewide
policy.
in
fact,
i
don't
think
you
could
have
a
statewide
policy.
it's
matter
of
each
jurisdiction.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
they
had
some
attorneys
who
will
show
up
at
the
lineup
and
see
that
perhaps
certain
procedures
are
called
and
if
they
are
not
then
take
the
witness
stand
but
they
can
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes,
that's
my
understanding
that
they
are
sort
of
as
an
observer
which
points
out
of
course
the
curious
role
of
counsel,
a
very
uncustomary
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes,
he
would
in
that
sense
i
don't
--
i
haven't
heard
of
them
since
where
they
will
send
somebody
to
represent
each
person.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that's
been
my
understanding
but
i
don't
want
to
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that's
been
my
understanding
but
i
just
have
this
on
what
i
have
been
told.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
certainly
and
one
can
imagine
if
the
court
remembers
the
line
up
in
gilbert
case
where
there
was
an
auditorium
formed.
there
was
a
parade
after
parade,
if
there
had
to
be
one
attorney
for
every
man
put
on
the
stagethere,
it
would
be
mammoth
production
indeed
which
would
drain
the
resources
of
the
county
bar
in
the
public
defender's
office.
the
way
you
described
that
one
situation,
the
counsel
would
be
quasi-magistrate,
would
he
not?
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes,
in
effect
he
would.
he
wouldn't
be
performing
as
traditional
task
of
representing
one
client
that
he'd
be
trying
to
perhaps
evaluate
the
competing
interest
of
the
various
persons
under
suspicion
at
that
time.
while
all
of
this
is
being
arranged
of
course
counsel,
the
counsel
is
there,
this
is
being
obtained,
the
guilty
suspect
might
be
putting
more
time
and
distance
between
himself
and
the
police
when
they
think
that
they
have
a
probable
suspect.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
paid
lawyers?
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well,paid
lawyers
might
be
there
but
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no,
there
are
paid
lawyers
but
i
think
in
this
situation
you
so
often
have
the
man
who
does
not
have
an
attorney.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no,
nobody
could
do
very
much
i
think.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
and
certainly
this
isn't
the
type
of
thing,
few
people
find
it
easy
to
employ
an
attorney
for
their
trial
as
it
is,
if
you
have
to
hire
your
attorney
to
sit
around
at
a
big
show
up
all
day,
there
are
going
to
be
more
people
who
meet
the
standards
of
indigency
i
think.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
may
i
have
an
extra
minute
or
two
to
wrap
up
in
detail.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
thank
you.
now,
i
would
like
to
indicate
too
that
what
can
an
attorney's
presence
accomplish
that
could
not
be
accomplished
well
or
better
by
cross
examination
in
conjunction
with
a
photograph,
perhaps
with
a
tape
recording
or
video
tape
of
the
whole
processes.
then
in
people
versus
lawrence,
the
california
supreme
court
did
uphold
the
showing
of
a
photograph
of
a
lineup
to
the
victim
in
the
absence
of
counsel
even
though
the
defendant
had
previously
retained
counsel.
on
the
theory
that
had
the
police
cut
out
the
faces
from
this
photograph
of
the
line
up
that
these
mug
shots
could
have
been
used.
but
that
here
there
was
no
confrontation
between
the
suspect
directly
and
his
accuser.
so
this
shows
some
of
the
conflicts
because
if
confrontation
is
really
the
basic
issue
then
why
did
the
court
in
williams
say
that
the
attorney
had
the
right
to
go
into
the
squad
room
when
the
defendant
wasn't
even
there
with
the
witness.
now,
basically
if
petitioner
kirby
had
the
right
to
have
appointed
counsel
at
the
show
up
in
a
couple
of
hours
after
his
arrest.
i
think
trial
courts
and
appellate
courts
in
the
states
would
be
very
hard
pressed
to
decide
to
draw
any
recent
distinction
as
to
when
counsel
can
be
had
when
if
it
can
not
be
had
at
beyond
the
scene
confrontation
or
whatever.
well,
perhaps
attractive
on
a
purely
theoretical
level,
the
rules
requiring
counsel
at
identification
confrontations
have
presented
these
numerous
practical
difficulties
in
their
application.
difficulties
which
were
perhaps
unforeseeable
at
the
time
wade
and
gilbert
came
down.
in
light
of
the
present
experience,
we
submit
that
this
court
should
overrule
its
experiment
of
four
years
the
wade
and
gilbert
rules.
you
have
to
ask
in
the
end,
what
could
counsel
have
done
for
kirby?
what
difference
would
there
have
been?
i
think
when
you
ask
those
questions
it's
clear
that
counsel
accomplished
nothing.
so
we
urge
the
overruling
of
wade
and
gilbert
on
those
grounds.
