justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you
not
saying
that
chief
justice’s
case
has
come
up
with
the
two
witnesses
and
they
say
they
give
them
all
of
the
miranda
and
all
of
other
warnings
and
he
says,
“i
would
not
do
anything
until
i
see
my
lawyer”.
those
two
witnesses
had
to
get
to
disown
him?
the
man
is
out
on
his
lawn
and
three
people
come
up.
the
detective
and
two
witnesses,
and
the
detective
says,
“i
have
two
witnesses
that
i
would
like
to
identify
you
or
not
identify
you
or
what
have
you.
but
you
do
not
have
to
submit
to
this,
unless
you
have
a
lawyer,”
and
he
says,
“well,
i
would
not
submit
that
--
i
would
have.”
those
two
witnesses
cannot
testify?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and,
they
get
two
demerits,
what
else?
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
because
this
case,
they
were
under
arrest.
justice
thurgood
marshall
for
what?
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
show
what
they
were
arrested
for?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but,
they
were
not
--
if
he
was
not
the
other
man
that
they
were
looking
for.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
does
the
record
show
what
they
were
arrested
for?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
record
does
show
clearly
that
they
were
in
custody
and
were
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
kirby
when
--
mr.
kirby,
excuse
me.
mr.
zagel
when
do
you
state
kirby
reach
the
“critical
stage?”
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
do
you
think
kirby
was
entitled
to
counsel?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
was
how
many
days
later?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
was
he
charged
with
robbery?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
they
were
holding
him
on?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
so
far
as
this
record
is
concerned,
we
do
not
know
why
he
was
arrested?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
would
the
record
show?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
what
crime
was
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
he
may
have?
justice
thurgood
marshall
probable
cause
that
he
may
have.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
may
have.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
man
is
arrested?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
assume
nobody
could
identify
the
traveler’s
check
what
would
happen
to
him
then?
in
illinois?
justice
thurgood
marshall
on
what
basis?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
was
he
charged
for
giving
this
information?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
do
not
know
what
he
was
arrested
for
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
i
mean
that
you
were
assuming
means
you
do
not
know
does
it
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
tells
me
what
charge
he
was
being
held
on
when
he
was
subjected
to
being
identified
by
a
witness,
i
do
not
know,
do
i?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but,
i
do
know
that
he
was
under
arrest.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
so,
the
cases
you
give
about
--
immediately
after
the
crime,
they
do
not
apply.
was
it
two
days
after
the
crime?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but,
it
is
true
they
did
not
have
the
slightest
idea
about
crime
when
they
are
arrested.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
wrong
with
him
testifying
to
the
truth?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
assume
that
kirby
does
not
care
about
that
point
or
he
would
not
be
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
have
asked
you
to
make
all
of
that
of
assumption,
why
can
not
i
make
that
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
do
not
agree
with
that
at
all.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
that
both
sides
were
looking
for
the
truth?
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
i
assume
sir
that
since
you
say
you
were
a
defense
counsel
you
only
want
to
get
your
man
acquitted
that
even
if
he
is
guilty
that
as
prosaically
you
want
him
convicted
even
though
he
is
innocent?
justice
thurgood
marshall
certainly
you
do
not
mean
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
except
the
cannons
(ph).
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
did
not
have
to
--
you
would
not
have
to
call
in,
would
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
would
not
have
call
the
defense
counsel
as
a
witness,
would
you?
you
are
so
interested
in
protecting
the
defendant’s
rights.
he
could
only
be
a
witness
if
the
prosecutor
calls.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
prosecutor
might
not
call?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
arrest.
i
mean
i
am
trying
to
get
--
there
were
no
problem
with
the
two
arrest,
but
for
the
purpose
of
holding
him
on
this
robbery
charge,
not
the
purpose
of
convicting,
do
you
make
any
point
on
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
takes
it
out
of
wade
and
gilbert.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
the
illinois
claim
that
the
two-day
period
is
not
that
important,
be
much
the
same,as
it
would
have
been
the
same
day?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
you
have
any
complaint
if
they
had
picked
kirby
two
days
before
under
the
exact
same
circumstances?
would
you
make
the
same
argument?
justice
thurgood
marshall
at
the
day
he
was
robbed.
justice
thurgood
marshall
under
the
exact
same
circumstance.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
zagel,
it
wasn't
lineup
in
this
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but,
if
he
had
been
there,
he
might
have
asked
a
very
simple
question,
are
these
two
men
under
arrest
or
not,
if
so
for
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
they
could
have
asked
it,
couldn't
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
could
have
said,
he
hasn't
got
any
charge,
they
try
him
loose
and
then
get
a
writ,
didn't
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
think,
could
have
in
all,
i
mean
we
would
at
least
have
had
that
question
settled.
i
don't
know
yet
whether
they
were
under
arrest
or
not.
justice
thurgood
marshall
alright,
an
investigatory
arrest.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
i
thought
you
said
it
was
an
investigatory?
justice
thurgood
marshall
were
they
booked?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean
those
are
the
problems
i
would
be
interested.
justice
thurgood
marshall
two
police
can
just
pick
two
men
up
and
take
them
in,
and
hold
them
without
any
--
i
hate
to
use
the
word
ceremony.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
petitioner
agreed
that
it
wasn't
too
long
a
time,
from
the
time
he
was
picked
up
until
the
time
he
was
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
court
upholds
your
position
without
overruling
wade
and
gilbert?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
why
do
we
have
to
get
to
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
wade
and
gilbert
says
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
suppose
we
say
that
wade-gilbert
doesn't
involve
the
right
of
the
man,
we
go
in
interrogation
would
you
be
satisfied?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
wouldn't
be
satisfied
unless
wade
and
gilbert
is
overruled
in
a
case
which
doesn't
involve
the
lineup.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
this
case
doesn't
involve
the
lineup.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
this
isn't
a
lineup
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
have
one
little
problem,
you
keep
saying
it's
not
the
usual
duty
of
the
lawyer.
what
about
paid
lawyers,
aren't
they
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don't
mean
that
it's
never
done.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
your
point
would
be
that
the
paid
lawyer
couldn't
do
any
more
than
the
public
defender.
justice
thurgood

that's
