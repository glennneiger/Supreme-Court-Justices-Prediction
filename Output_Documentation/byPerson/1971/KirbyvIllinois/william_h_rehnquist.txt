justice
william
h.
rehnquist
without
the
benefit
of
any
constitutional
principal
defense
counsel
at
the
trial
is
always
free
to
bring
out
and
cross
examination
and
to
argue
to
the
jury
these
very
facts
that
you’re
talking
about
now,
have
they
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
solovy,
i
take
your
--
take
an
argument
in
before
the
illinois
appellate
court
in
this
case
on
the
evidence
that
was
permitted
to
come
in
by
the
trial
court.
would
you
say
there
was
a
strong
argument
to
be
made
as
a
matter
of
state
law
given
both
the
identification
and
the
documents
found
on
the
defendants
that
there
was
--
the
evidence
was
insufficient
as
a
matter
of
state
law
to
convict
him?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
that
wasn’t
the
only
evidence
of
guilt,
was
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
about
the
traveler’s
check?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
this
wasn’t
just
a
swearing
contest
where
there
was
not
corroboration
on
either
side.
there
was
corroboration
of
the
complainant’s
testimony
to
the
extent
of
this
documents
were
found
on
the
person
of
the
petitioner.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
don’t
you
view
this
corroboration?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
know,
i
don’t
need
conclusive
corroboration
but
i
just
meant
to
ask
whether
or
not
in
your
opinion
this
was
simply
a
question
of
a
two
persons
uncorroborated
views
being
judged
by
the
jury
or
whether
there
was
additional
evidence
that
a
reasonable
juror
could
find
to
be
corroborated.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
solovy,
that
one
question
you
read
of
the
prosecutor
asking
shard,
and
you
positively
identified
them
at
the
station
apparently,
wouldn’t
that
the
objection
under
the
illinois
law
as
leading?
i
mean
couldn’t
the
defense
counsel
have
put
the
prosecutor
through
a
little
more
of
a
performance
on
that
point
simply
as
a
matter
of
state
evidence
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
question
least
argued
there
was
objection
or
was
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
solovy,
it
was
my
understanding
mr.
zagel
had
answered
to
the
question
of
mr.
justice
white,
said
that
although
illinois
wanted
the
way
decision
overruled,
they
also
took
the
position
that
it
could
be
limited
to
the
post-indictment
situation
which
as
i
understand
were
the
facts
of
the
wade
and
gilbert.
