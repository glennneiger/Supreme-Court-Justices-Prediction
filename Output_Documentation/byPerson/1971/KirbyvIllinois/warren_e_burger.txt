we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
5061,
kirby
against
illinois.
mr.
seng,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
not
sure
that
the
record
states
that
exactly,
but
i
think
that
is
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
you
are
going
to
require
him
to
have
a
lawyer?
let
us
take
not
the
case
of
the
police
station,
let
us
take
it,
just
the
way,
justice
white
gave
it
to
you.
asked
the
witness
to
walk
with
a
plain
posed
man
and
view
this
man
while
he
is
cutting
his
lawn
or
shopping
in
supermarket,
whatever.
i
have
to
go
up
to
him
and
say,
“sir,
we
are
about
to
have
some
witnesses
look
at
you
and
it
is
our
duty
to
warn
you
that
you
are
entitled
to
counsel
before
they
look
at
you,”
is
that
the
procedure?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suggest
that
to
you
that
most
innocent
people
would
resent
the
idea
of
the
policeman
approaching
them
while
they
are
cutting
their
lawn
or
at
their
work
for
some
of
such
place.
they
are
telling
you
get
a
lawyer
for
they
had
some
witnesses
look
at
them.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
a
policeman
gives
of
warning
to
anyone,
this
puts
him
in
a
rather
special
kind
of
a
class,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
submitted
a
suspect
plans,
in
the
sense
that
we
use
that
term
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
seng.
mr.
zagel,
will
now
ask
you
to
start
now
for
a
lunch.
in
the
meantime
i
would
like
to
indicate
the
counsel
in
number
70
federal
trade
commission
and
sperry
hutchinson
that
case
will
not
be
reached
today
and
they
maybe
excused
if
present
and
if
they
are
not
present
in
the
court
room.
the
clerk
communication
with
counsel
and
release
them.
mr.
zagel,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
supreme
court
of
california?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
believe
in
the
cannons,
the
newest
standards,
the
american
bar
required
the
defense
counsel
to
protect
all
confidentiality
of
his
client?
chief

warren
e.
burger
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
zagel.
mr.
william,
you
have
about
nine
minutes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
--
as
your
friend
had
suggested,
shard
had
said,
“no,
these
are
not
the
men.”
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
in
getting
ahead
of
yourself,
they
were
going
to
determine
whether
he
should
be
charged.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
would
have
happened
if
shard
had
said,
no,
these
are
not
the
men,
your
friend
said
they
would
have
been
released,
do
you
agree
with
that
likely
result?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
they
probably
or
possibly
have
been
subject
to
a
charge
for
possession
of
recently
stolen
property?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
seng.
thank
you
mr.
zagel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.

we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
number
70-5061,
kirby
against
illinois.
mr.
solovy
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
when
you
were
using
those
terms,
were
you
referring
to
an
identification
in
the
courtroom
or
an
identification
sometime
prior
to
that
in
whatever
process.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
but
you’re
not
describing
every
courtroom
in
the
united
states,
might
just
be
cook
county
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
there
is
something
inherently
unreliable
about
the
courtroom
identification
of
a
person
under
oath
on
the
stand
because
he
is
quite
sure
that
that’s
the
man
that
stabbed
or
shot
him
or
cut
him
or
whatever?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
wouldn’t
want
as
to
decide
the
case
on
that
hypothetical
situation,
would
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
supposed
that’s
even
more
aggravated
if
a
man
holds
up
a
supermarket
and
the
eleven
witnesses
take
the
stand
and
say,
yes,
this
is
the
man.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
would
you
say
all
eleven
of
those
people
are
subject
ti
this
infirmity
unreliability
that
you’ve
been
describing
to
us?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
trial
the
case,
was
there
an
instruction
given
with
respect
to
any
inferences
that
can
be
drawn
from
the
possession
of
recently
stoling
--
stolen
property
having
in
mind
the
credit
cards
and
the
money
orders
of
mr.
shard
that
were
found
in
the
possession
in
this
two
men?
chief

warren
e.
burger
is
that
an
instruction
(voice

chief

warren
e.

my
recollection
of
the
evidence
was
that
one
of
the
two
codefendants
testified
that
he
had
won
these
money
orders
rolling
dice.
chief

warren
e.
burger
then
what
about
this
--
whoever
--
who
said
they
were
found
in
an
alley?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
had
anyone
--
does
this
record
show
whether
shard
when
he
came
to
the
police
station,
was
aware
that
bean
and
kirby
had
his
money
orders
and
his
credit
cards?
chief

warren
e.

no,
at
the
trial
was
it
developed
on
cross

of
shard
whether
when
he
made
the
original
identification,
he
knew
that
these

had
his
money

chief

warren
e.

no.
chief

warren
e.

we’ll
pick
that
up
at

point
in

chief

we

very
well.
mr.

chief

is
that
the
practice
in
illinois
in
or
is
it
required
to
take
photographs
of
lineups?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
point
of
time
mr.
zagel,
when
did
the
police
telephone
shard
and
find
that
traveler's
checks
and
credit
cards
had
been
stolen
from
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
at
that
time,
would
you
say
that
they
had
a
basis
for
arrest
and
custody
for
the
possession
of
recently
stolen
property?
chief

warren
e.

mr.

chief

warren
e.

mr.
george,
can
i
interrupt
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
marion
and
fowler,
the
supreme
court
of
california
decision
were
those
grounded
on
the
federal
constitutional
principles?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
california,
unanimous
in
those
cases?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
the
court
suggest
any
hypothesis
as
to
what
other
purpose
of
the
lineup
suppose
would
be
fought?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
which
of
the
cases
was
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
wouldn't
violate
professional
ethics
as
he
retired
from
the
case,
would
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
is
consuming
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
we
will
give
you
two
minutes
and
enlarge
your
friend's
time
the
same
amount.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
george.
mr.
solovy.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
think
that
at
the
time
police
learned
that
the
travelers
checks
and
credit
cards
of
the
two
confining
witness
had
been
stolen
and
were
in
the
possession
of
these
two
men
that
they
had
probable
cause
to
arrest
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
they
got
into
the
police
station
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
prosecution,
you
mean
the
investigation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
the
policemen
out
on
the
beach
when
he
found
these
travelers
checks
in
the
name
of
another
person
and
got
conflicting
answers
as
to
how
they
happened
to
be
in
possession.
do
you
say
that
that
was
not
reasonable
grounds
on
which
to
think
that
the
crime
had
been
committed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
perhaps
he
had
committed
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
then
do
you
say
that
we
could
not
affirm
this
conviction
of
kirby
without
overruling
wade
and
gilbert.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
when
you
talked
about
wade
and
stovall
before,
i
didn't
understand
you
to
argue
that
wade
and
stovall
literally
required
this
result
that
only
that
the
philosophy
underlying
those
cases
called
for
an
extension
to
the
pre-indictment
period.
chief
justice
warren
e.

thank
you,
mr.

would
you
think
that
at

time
police
learned
that
the

checks
and
credit
cards
of
the
two
confining
witness
had
been
stolen
and
were
in
the

of
these
two

that
they
had
probable
cause

arrest

what
about
the
policemen
out
on
the
beach
when
he
found
these

checks
in
the
name
of
another
person
and
got
conflicting

to
how
they
happened
to
be
in
possession.
do
you
say
that
that
was
not
reasonable
grounds
on
which
to
think
that
the
crime
had
been
committed?

that
perhaps
he
had
committed
it.

then
do
you
say
that
we
could
not
affirm
this
conviction

well,
when
you
talked
about
wade
and
stovall
before,
i
didn't
understand
you
to
argue
that
wade
and
stovall
literally
required
this
result
that
only
that
the
philosophy
underlying
those
cases
called
for
an
extension
to
the
pre-indictment
period.

thank
you,

thank
you
