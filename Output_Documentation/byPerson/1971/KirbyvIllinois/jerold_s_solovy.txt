mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
again
heard
on
re-argument
that
takes
us
back
to,
after
listening
to
the
last
arguments,
more
simplistic
questions
of
criminal
law
and
involves
the
proper
application
of
gilbert
and
wade
to
pre-indictment
identification
proceedings.
and
i
use
the
term
pre-indictment
identification
proceedings
because
there
was
no
lineup
as
such
in
this
case.
we
should
also
bear
in
mind
that
the
facts
of
this
case
pertaining
to
a
case
where
the
defendant
has
been
arrested
and
he
is
in
police
custody,
and
the
identification
takes
place
at
the
police
station.
i
assume
for
the
purpose
of
my
argument
that
we
are
dealing
with
the
petitioner’s
right
to
counsel
under
the
sixth
amendment
and
that
the
identification
process
is
not
violative
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self-incrimination
because
this
court
decided
in
wade
and
gilbert,
that
such
identification
and
proceedings
did
not
abridge
the
defendant’s
privilege
against
self
incrimination.
so
i
will
be
restricting
my
argument
to
petitioner’s
right
under
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
that
is
correct,
justice
stewart
but
i
think
is
illinois
argues
in
its
brief
that
in
deciding
the
case
would
be
within
the
discretion
of
the
court
to
say
if
the
court
we’re
to
say
that
we
do
not
have
to
reach
the
gilbert
and
wade
question
because
this
identification
was
so
violative
of
due
process
that
it
comes
within
stovall,
i
think
that
clearly
would
be
within
the
province
in
jurisdiction
and
quite
proper
within
the
grant
of
certiorari
in
this
case
to
take
that
view.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
no,
we
do
not,
i
do
not
believe.
i’ll
double
check
but
i
think
our
separate
questions
were
dealing
with
the
propriety
of
the
arrest
and
the
propriety
of
the
search
and
seizure.
i
will
check
(voice
overlap)
certiorari
petition,
but
i
might
point
that
i
believe
in
all
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
dealing
with
this
question,
this
court
always
ends
up
with
the
stovall
issue
in
any
event.
the
court
may
say
we
will
not
apply
wade
and
gilbert
retroactively
or
we
will
apply
it
retroactively
and
the
court
looks
at
the
stovall
issue.
now,
i
think
that
it
would
be
proper
for
the
court
in
this
case
to
look
at
the
stovall
issue.
and
my
--
this
the
same,
my
associate
points
out
that
the
first
question
in
our
petition
was
that
the
identification
should
have
been
by
means
of
a
lineup
that
there
were
not
compelling
circumstances
just
to
find
a
show
up.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
peripherally
that
is
a
stovall
claim
but
it’s
my
position
mr.
justice
stewart
that
this
court
could
under
the
grant
of
certiorari
look
at
the
stovall
issue.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
you
did
decline
to
accept
that
question
as
barely
drawn.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
well,
i
think
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
in
reading
the
decisions
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
they
say
two
things,
they
say
that
we
will
not
apply
gilbert
and
wade
to
pre-indictment
identifications
and
then
they
will
look
in
a
proper
case
to
see
whether
stovall
versus
denno
is
applicable
and
they
will
look
to
the
facts
of
a
particular
case.
now,
the
illinois
supreme
court
refused
to
do
that
in
this
case
by
refusing
to
grant
our
petition
for
leave
to
appeal.
this
case
comes
before
this
court
from
the
decision
of
the
illinois
appellate
court.
and
analyzing
the
facts
in
this
case,
its
also
important
to
bear
in
mind,
the
petitioner
was
an
indigent
person
throughout
the
course
of
the
illinois
proceedings,
being
represented
in
a
criminal
court
by
the
public
defender
and
then
in
the
illinois
appellate
court
by
court-appointed
counsel,
mr.
sang
(ph).
we
have
followed
the
case
to
this
court.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
no!
your
honor
it
can
be
no
question
mr.
justice
stewart
that
there
was
an
--
in
--
a
separate
in
court
identification
as
i
will
get
to
him
my
argument,
the
in-court
identification
was
wholly
dependent
upon
the
police
station
identification,
they
--
the
view
of
the
illinois
appellate
court
was
rather
that
the
victim
in
this
case
had
a
sufficient
opportunity
to
observe
this
assailant
and
i
will
go
into
those
facts
before
this
court
because
it
think
that
conclusion
is
not
sustained
by
the
record
that
the
--
you
cannot
say
that
the
victim
in
this
case
had
an
ample
opportunity,
he
did
--
had
never
seen
this
gentlemen
before
in
his
life?
at
the
most
he
only
had
a
few
seconds
to
observe
them
and
that
as
whole
identification
came
from
the
police
station
identification
which
as
i
will
show
is
rankly
violative
of
stovall
but
since
again
mr.
justice
stewart
since
you
raise
the
question,
illinois
assumes
that
that
issue
is
before
this
court
at
least
collaterally
by
saying
at
page
42
of
their
brief,
that
this
court
can
overrule
gilbert
and
wade
by
looking
to
the
holding
stovall
and
by
applying
to
this
case
in
all
other
cases.
the
stovall
test
of
whether
the
identification
is
so
ranked
and
so
pre
assess
to
violate
due
process,
so
i
submit
that
that
issue
one
way
or
another
passed
to
be
before
the
court
in
deciding
this
case.
after
he
kept
--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
the
identification
mr.
chief
justice
before
the
courtroom
identification,
the
courtroom
identification
is
always
very
dignified,
is
also
very
rote.
you
have
to
understand
it’s
what
--
is
made
by
rote,
the
witness
has
no
really
choice
in
the
courtroom
because
of
the
geographic
location
of
everybody.
when
you
have
a
trial
in
the
criminal
court
of
cook
county
and
the
witness
is
on
the
stand
and
the
--
the
witness
was
asked,
he
was
asked
in
this
case,
do
you
see
your
assailants?
the
witness
looks
around,
he
has
the
judge
to
his
left,
he
has
the
jutry
to
the
right
--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
that
is
--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
i
am
saying
mr.
chief
justice
that
for
my
very
realistic
point
of
view,
there
is
something
unreliable
because
the
witness
understands,
sees
the
prosecutor
--
he
sees
the
defense
counsel
has
rested
a
nice
suit
and
he
sees
the
defendant
in
90%
over
the
cases,
an
indigent
person,
the
defendant
is
not
out
on
bail,
he
is
surrounded
by
the
bailers
wearing
a
badge,
they
are
sitting
around
him,
and
naturally
he
will
pick
out
the
defendant,
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
was
a
case
in
cook
county
about
a
year
ago,
where
the
public
defender
brought
in
to
the
courtroom
by
some
ruse
a
different
defendant,
in
another
case
and
the
witness
picked
out
that
defendant
as
his
assailant.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
no,
i
do
not
mr.
chief
justice,
i
only
point
out
that
because
of
that
reality
of
any
criminal
case
that
the
pre
trial
identification
is
the
crucial
identification.
that
is
the
identification
as
this
court
said
in
gilbert,
as
this
court
said
in
wade
will
determine
that
faith
of
the
accused.
if
he
is
identified
improperly
in
the
police
station
that
identification
is
going
to
take
all
the
way
through
to
the
trial.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
yes.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
you
are
entirely
correct.
illinois
has
a
patterned
jury
instruction
which
we
have
on
your
criminal
cases
which
points
out
that
the
jury
is
entitled
to
consider
the
opportunity
to
observe
the
defendant
and
circumstances
such
as
that,
but
the
impartial
so
to
speak,
identification
of
an
accused
by
the
victim
on
the
stand
is
the
most
hoped
evidence
that
the
prosecution
has
in
its
arsenal
in
convicting
a
defendant.
in
my
judgment,
in
experience
which
is
limited
to
appointed
cases
but
in
my
experience
that
type
of
evidence
is
much
more
legal
to
the
defendant
than
as
a
confession
from
its
own
mouth.
when
you
have
a
witness
who
gets
on
the
stand,
and
says
that
is
the
man
who
held
me
up,
that
is
the
man
who
robbed
me,
it
is
very
difficult
to
get
a
jury
to
disbelieve
that
witness.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
it
is
much
more
aggravated.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
right.
when
i
say
its
an
infirmity
of
unreliability,
i
am
not
suggesting
mr.
chief
that
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
that
you
have
a
lineup
so
to
speak
although
that
would
certainly,
if
you’re
speaking
about
realities,
mr.
chief
justice
of
a
criminal
trial
that
would
certainly
be
much
more
reliable
than
asking
the
witness,
does
he
or
she
see
his
assailant
her
assailant
in
the
courtroom
when
there
is
only
one
person
from
whom
the
witness
can
pick
out.
he
has
to
pick
out
the
defendant.
there
is
no
one
else
there.
it
would
be
much
more
reliable
i
suppose
if
you
had
a
lineup
in
the
courtroom
and
then
i
would
like
to
see
if
the
defendant
was
protected
by
not
having
the
witnesses
seeing
their
picture.
how
many
victims
could
pick
out
their
assailants?
i
think
you
would
see
an
entirely
different
result
but
since
we
do
not
do
that
in
the
trial
in
our
criminal
cases
and
i
have
seen
very
few
judges
who
allow
you
to
do
that
other
than
in
preliminary
hearings.
i
submit
that
it
is
particularly
important
that
we
protect
the
pre
trial
identification
proceeding
to
make
sure
that
that
was
not
tainted.
now
jumping
ahead
of
my
story
for
a
second
to
point
out
that
what
happened
in
this
case
was
that
the
defendant
and
his
codefendant
were
sitting
in
a
squad
in
the
city
of
chicago
police
station
between
their
two
arresting
officers.
the
complainant
had
said
that
the
assailants
were
negro,
the
two
defendants
were
negro,
the
two
officers
were
white
and
the
victim
was
brought
in
and
said,
point
out
your
assailants.
well,
that
is
highly
a
very
fair
way
to
conduct
an
identification
proceedings.
he
could
either
pick
amongst
the
two
negro
defendants
or
the
two
white
police
officers.
and
when
you
have
that
type
of
identification
in
the
absence
of
counsel
and
that
is
what
you
will
have
in
the
absence
of
counsel,
because
these
police
officers
were
not
raw
rookies
they
have
on
the
force
eleven
years,
they
knew
better
and
they
conducted
this
type
of
identification
proceeding
either
because
they
were
lazy
or
because
they
were
indifferent
to
the
defendants’
rights.
i
don’t
really
believe
that
these
police
officers
were
trying
to
railroad
this
defendants,
this
wasn’t
a
hot
case.
this
was
just
an
ordinary
robbery.
they
happened
to
--
onto
these
defendants
and
unless
you
have
counsel
present,
then
you
are
not
going
to
have
a
fair
identification
proceeding.
now
to
go
back
to
the
facts
of
the
case,
on
february
20,
1968,
at
approximately
4:30
pm,
the
victim
in
this
case
mr.
shard,
had
recently
returned
from
trip
to
orleans,
it
was
late
afternoon,
he
was
walking
down
the
street
on
the
west
side
of
chicago.
the
record
doesn’t
disclose
bit
from
the
neighborhood
in
which
mr.
shard
live
in,
i
believe
that
it’s
a
fair
assumption
that
he
is
also
a
negro.
he
stated
that
he
noticed
two
men
behind
him,
at
about
15
feet
behind
him,
and
that
the
next
thing
he
knew
as
he
was
about
to
cross
the
street
to
go
to
a
restaurant,
he
was
grabbed
from
behind,
he
did
not
know
who
grabbed
him
from
behind.
they
held
him,
they
took
his
wallet.
his
wallet
contained
$140.00
and
traveler’s
checks,
$30
to
$35
of
cash
and
certain
identification
papers.
he
went
one
direction.
his
assailants
went
the
other
direction.
the
record
does
not
disclose
what
time
elapsed
but
we
can
assume
that
since
this
happened
on
the
street,
that
it
happened
pretty
rapidly.
mr.
shard,
the
victim
did
not
report
this
occurrence
to
the
city
of
chicago
police
till
the
next
day.
at
that
time,
he
gave
only
the
most
general
of
descriptions
to
the
police.
on
the
very
next
day,
february
22,
two
city
of
chicago
police
officers
were
cruising
in
a
non-marked
car
on
the
west
side
of
chicago.
they
had
no
knowledge
whatsoever
of
this
crime.
they
were
totally
ignorant
of
the
crime,
and
they
happened
to
see
the
petitioner,
mr.
kirby
walking
on
the
street
with
mr.
bean
who
was
eventually
to
be
his
codefendant.
now
this
was
february
1968
and
one
officer
had
in
his
possession
a
flyer
which
said
that
one,
alfonso
hampton,
was
wanted
for
a
competent
escape
and
he
said
to
his
partner,
see
that
fellow,
he
looks
like
hampton.
now
the
flyer
described
hampton
as
being
five
foot,
two
inches
tall
and
the
same
officer
testified
in
court,
the
petitioner
was
5
foot,
5
inches
in
height.
but
in
any
event,
he
stopped
petitioner
and
bean,
and
he
said
are
you
hampton
and
petitioner
kirby
said,
no
i
am
not,
he
said,
let
me
see
your
identification
papers.
so
petitioner
took
out
his
wallet,
started
to
show
the
officers
the
identification
papers
identifying
himself,
this
time
its
kirby
and
the
officer
testified
he
saw
some
traveler’s
checks
in
his
wallet
and
he
saw
the
name
willie
and
he
asked
petitioner
what
those
traveler’s
and
petitioner
responded
that
it
was
play
money.
now
the
officer
testified
that
he
thereafter
asked
petitioner
to
give
them
the
checks.
his
partner
testified
that
this
officer
took
the
checks
himself
out
of
the
wallet
and
there
he
saw
the
full
name
willie
shard.
now
bear
in
mind
he
still
did
not
know
that
a
robbery
had
taken
place,
but
he
said,
where
did
you
get
the
traveler’s
checks?
and
the
petitioner
said,
i
won
them
in
a
crap
game.
they
searched
the
other
codefendant
and
they
found
some
identifications
papers
also
bearing
the
name
willie
shard,
petitioner
had
identification
papers
bearing
the
name
willie
shard
and
they
were
taken
to
the
police
station,
put
under
arrest.
i
don’t
now
whether
they
were
arrested
for
a
robbery
of
mr.
shard
because
the
officers
didn’t
know
that
this
robbery
had
taken
place
or
whether
they
were
arrested
because
the
officers
thought
he
was
hampton
wanted
for
the
(inaudible)
some
nine
months
ago.
the
record
doesn’t
disclose
what
happened
when
they
got
to
the
police
station
in
terms
of
whether
the
police
determined
that
hampton
was
or
was
not
still
at
large.
in
any
event
they
checked
the
records,
they
found
that
mr.
shard
had
been
robbed
and
they
called
up,
contact
another
officer
who
proceeded
in
bringing
mr.
shard
to
the
police
station.
now,
it
now
it
took
several
hours
to
bring
mr.
shard
to
the
police
station.
under
illinois
law,
petitioner
had
the
right
to
consult
with
counsel.
if
petitioner
were
a
rich
man,
his
lawyer
would
have
been
there
within
a
matter
of
five
or
ten
minutes,
but
he
had
no
money
and
he
was
not
advised
of
his
right
to
counsel
although
that
is
his
statutory
right
under
illinois
law,
to
consult
with
counsel
as
soon
as
he
is
arrested
for
as
many
times
as
he
wishes.
he
was
not
advised
of
this
right.
while
they
waited
several
hours
for
mr.
shard
to
came
in
to
the
squad
room
and
there
were
the
two
white
police
officers,
there
were
the
two
negro
defendants,
mr.
shard
was
asked,
if
they
were
his
assailants?
he
said,
yes,
whereupon
the
state
not
very
rapidly
proceeded
to
bring
this
matter
to
indictment.
there
was
a
preliminary
hearing
held
on
this
days.
some
five
weeks
later,
on
march
25,
again
in
direct
violation
of
illinois
law,
counsel
was
not
appointed
to
represent
petitioner
at
this
preliminary
hearing.
this
isn’t
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
this
is
a
matter
of
illinois
statute
as
at
a
preliminary
hearing
the
defendant
shall
have
counsel
appointed
to
representative.
no
counsel
was
appointed.
petitioner
bean
were
indicted
on
april
20
--
on
april
8,
they
were
arraigned
on
april
16
some
eight
weeks
following
their
arrest.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
clearly,
mr.
justice
brennan
as
i
will
develop
in
a
minute,
it
was
really
crucial
for
their
defense
and
yet
even
under
the
states
attorney’s
examination
we
will
see
that
damaging
evidence
was
elicited
from
the
complainant.
so
some
eight
weeks
later
we
finally
have
counsel
appointed.
appointed
council
filed
on
behalf
on
both
defendants
a
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence.
a
motion
to
suppress
the
station
house
identification,
these
were
denied.
the
jury
found
the
defendants
guilty.
they
were
given
a
term
of
five
to
12
years.
i
might
point
out
because
it
is
significant
in
the
case
of
mr.
bean
that
an
appeal
to
the
illinois
appellate
court,
the
state
of
illinois
conceded
for
the
first
time
that
his
arrest
was
indeed
illegal
and
based
upon
that
concession
the
illinois
appellate
court
reversed
the
conviction
outright,
they
said,
they
have
no
right
to
detain
them,
they
had
no
right
to
identify
him,
therefore
there
was
no
other
evidence
to
convict
bean
on
and
they
reversed
the
case
outright.
now
we
should
get
some
facts
in
clear
focus.
the
state
of
illinois
and
the
state
of
california’s
amicus
in
their
brief,
contend,
may
it
please
the
court
that
this
assailant
had
a
chance
to
have
a
clear
view
and
a
long
time
to
observe
there
--
his
assailants
so
that
there
could
be
no
question
as
the
identification.
i
want
to
point
out
in
that
connection
that
mr.
shard’s
identification
to
the
police,
the
very
day
after
the
robbery
was
that
he
described
both
defendants
in
the
same
manner
identically
that
they’re
both
between
5’
6”
and
5’7”,
that
they
both
weight
between
a
140
and
150
pounds
and
that
they
were
both
dark
brown
skin.
no
further
description
was
given
according
to
this
record
of
these
defendants
and
at
the
trial,
mr.
shard
was
asked,
i
read
from
page
23
of
the
record,
did
you
tell
the
police
what
they
were
wearing
or
anything?
answer,
well,
no.
i
did
not
directly
see
what
they
was
wearing,
how
they
was
dresses.
question,
you
did
not
observe
what
they
were
wearing
regarding
their
clothing,
trousers
or
anything?
answer,
right.
question,
you
did
not
see
what
they
were
wearing?
answer,
no.
so
that
the
victim
did
not
even
have
the
opportunity
to
see
anything
about
how
his
assailants
were
dressed
and
bear
in
mind
he
first
saw
him
15
feet
away
and
did
not
pay
any
attention
to
them.
he
was
grabbed
from
behind,
they
took
his
wallet
and
then
he
went
in
one
direction,
his
assailants
went
another
direction.
and
yet
--
and
the
state
argues
because
they
have
mr.
shard
crying
for
the
trial
that
he
had
a
good
opportunity
to
observe
his
assailants.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
mr.
chief
justice
we
do
not
have
the
full
record
here.
normally
--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
that
instruction
under
my
knowledge
and
i
will
check
it
overnight
is
not
given
in
the
robbery
case,
it
was
given
in
the
burglary
case,
it
is
given
in
the
theft
case,
i
do
not
believe
that
that
instruction
is
given
in
the
robbery
case
but
i
will
check
that
mr.
chief
justice.
so
that
there
would
not
in
any
event,
however
mr.
chief
justice,
be
a
sufficient
record
to
convict
either
of
these
defendants
if
you
did
not
have
an
identification,
in
other
words,
under
illinois
law,
i’m
sure
the
state
of
illinois
will
concede
because
there
was
an
outright
reversal
by
the
illinois
appellate
court
as
to
defendant
bean
that
the
mere
possession
of
stolen
property
might
unexplained
support
another
charge,
its
certainly
mr.
chef
justice,
would
not
support
in
illinois
absence
any
another
proof
they
charge
a
robbery.
you
need
something
further
than
the
mere
possession
of
stolen
property
in
order
to
convict
the
man
of
robbery.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
no.
once
you
had
the
admissibility
mr.
justice
rehnquist
of
the
identification
by
the
victim
of
his
assailants,
once
you
have
that,
then
there
certainly
wasn’t
enough
sufficient
evidence
to
convict
these
defendants
if
you
knocked
out,
it
should
have
been
knocked
out.
the
station
house
identification
upon
which
the
in
court
identification
was
based
then
he
would
not
have
sufficient
evidence
to
convict.
under
no
ones
imagination
would
there
be
sufficient
evidence.
the
whole
case
hinged
upon
the
station
house
identification
law.
the
whole
case
rose
and
fall
--
fell
on
that
identification.
if
that
identification
was
out
as
the
illinois
appellate
court
held,
we
should’ve
been
in
bean’s
case
they
reversed
the
case
outright,
they
did
not
even
send
it
back
for
a
new
trial.
they
just
released
mr.
bean.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
yes
it
was
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
well,
i’m
saying
the
possession
--
the
reason
--
possession
of
the
traveler’s
checks
and
the
identification
papers
that
was
one
item
of
evidence
and
the
other
item
of
evidence,
the
crucial
item
of
evidence
was
the
station
house
identification
which
was
repeated
in
the
courtroom,
but
if
you
knocked
out
station
house
identification
and
all
you
have
is
the
possession
of
the
traveler’s
checks
and
identification
papers
then
that
is
not
sufficient
to
support
a
conviction
of
robbery.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
if
you
view
that
as
a
corroboration,
that
is
correct.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
well
i
don’t
know
as
in
any
case,
there
can
be,
you
know
an
explanation
mr.
bean
gave
an
explanation
he
said
they
found
the
traveler’s
check
and
the
identification
papers
in
an
alley
some
two
hours
before
they
were
arrested.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
there
was,
once
you
admit
the
legality
of
the
identification,
then
there
was
sufficient
basis
for
the
conviction.
if
you
knocked
out
the
identification
or
your
left
this
the
reason
possession
of
the
stolen
property
and
that
is
the
illinois
appellate
court
held
was
not
sufficient
to
sustain
the
conviction
and
that’s
all
the
evidence
there
was
in
this
case.
this
was
a
jury
case
they
were
starting
to
complete
in
one
day.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
my
petitioner,
your
honor
stated
--
gave
two
explanations
to
the
police
and
that
is
his
first,
was
before
the
police
officer
saw
the
entire
traveler’s
checks
he
said
it
was
play
money,
he
then
said
that
it
was
won
in
the
crap
game.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
that
was
the
codefendant
mr.
bean
who
was
--
who
in
the
state
of
illinois
before
the
illinois
appellate
court
conceded
was
arrested
illegally
and
the
illinois
appellate
court
reversed
this
condition
outright
mr.
chief
justice
so
that
case
is
not
before
this
court,
mr.
bean
just
his
codefendant
as
well.
now,
i
want
to
point
out
what
happened
in
the
station
house
identification
in
this
case
because
i
think
all
the
ills
that
this
court
perceived
in
gilbert
and
wade
came
true
in
this
case.
mr.
shard
was
contacted
by
a
third
police
officer.
he
was
asked
if
he
was
robbed.
he
was
asked
if
he
could
identify
his
assailants.
he
was
told
that
they
had
two
suspects
in
custody
and
he
was
brought
to
the
police
station.
now
the
state
of
illinois
and
the
state
of
california’s
amicus
would
lead
this
court
to
believe
that
mr.
shard
walked
in
to
the
police
station
and
made
this
spontaneous
identification
of
his
assailants.
they
walked
in
and
said
those
are
the
men.
now
the
record
is
quite
to
the
contrary.
reading
at
page
24,
this
is
when
mr.
shard
testified
at
the
trial,
then
running
on
to
page
25.
question:
did
the
police
officer
anything
to
you?
answer:
they
asked
me
to
point
them
out
and
i
pointed
them
two
guys
out.
question:
they
asked
you
if
these
were
the
ones.
answer:
right.
question:
how
many
other
people
were
sitting
there?
answer:
i
did
not
pay
much
attention.
question:
they
asked
you
if
these
two
kirby
and
bean
were
the
one,
correct.
answer:
yes.
then
a
little
later
because
there
was
four
people
in
the
room,
two
white
officers
and
two
negro
defendants,
the
defense
counsel
said,
did
he
asked
you
about
the
other
ones
to
which
the
--
mr.
shard
said
no,
they
just
asked
me
if
kirby
and
bean
were
the
ones
and
i
said
they
were.
so
i
submit
that
there
was
no
spontaneous
identification.
that
the
identification
was
based
solely
upon
the
fact
that
you
had
two
white
officers
and
two
negro
defendants
and
if
that
is
a
lineup,
then
if
that
is
identification
then
the
criminal
process
in
this
country
has
come
to
a
very
sad
state.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
they’re
both
negro,
your
honor.
both
shard
--
shard
is
--
as
i
state
--
at
the
beginning
of
my
argument
mr.
justice
stewart
the
record
doesn’t
disclose
but
from
the
address
in
which
he
lives
and
my
knowledge
of
the
city
of
chicago
i
would
say
he
was
a
negro.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
he
--
mr.
--
if
it
may
please
court
mr.
chief
justice,
he
didn’t
--
he’d
never
seen
bean
and
kirby
before.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
i
don’t
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
the
record
doesn’t
disclose
that.
i
do
want
to
point
out
that
there
was
no
independent
in
court
identification
in
this
case.
the
record
at
page
21
shows
that
at
the
trial,
shard
was
asked,
question:
when
you
went
to
the
police
station
did
you
see
the
two
defendants?
answer:
yes
i
did.
question:
do
you
see
them
in
court
today?
answer:
yes
sir.
question:
point
them
out
please.
answer:
yes,
that
one
and
the
other
one,
indicating
shard
and
bean.
question:
and
you
positively
identified
them
at
the
police
station,
is
that
correct?
answer:
yes.
so
that
you
have
a
perfect
case
fitting
within
all
force
of
gilbert.
i
submit
that
the
state
of
illinois
and
the
state
of
california
impliedly
concede
that
gilbert
and
wade
apply
to
pre-indictment
identification
proceedings
since
they
asked
that
this
court
overturned
those
decisions.
i
do
not
believe
that
california
and
illinois
would
take
that
position
unless
they
really
admitted
and
really
knew
that
gilbert
and
wade
by
its
force,
by
its
language,
by
its
rationale,
by
its
philosophy
must
by
force
applied
to
pre-indictment
situations.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
certainly
mr.
justice
rehnquist
but
when
you
have
a
defense
counsel,
public
defender
who
is
highly
experienced,
they
try
hundreds
of
these
cases
more
than
i
will
try
in
a
lifetime,
he
knows
that
as
a
matter
of
trial
tactics
if
he
gets
up
and
objects
that
the
question
is
leading,
what
have
you
--
that
he
will
only
be
highlighting
in
exacerbating
the
problem,
so
as
a
matter
of
trial
tactics,
share
the
question
was
leading
but
as
a
matter
of
trial
fact
as
he
wanted
to
not
object.
i
don’t
know
the
public
defender
who
handled
this
case
that
is
only
my
supposition.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
i
--
the
whole
line
of
questioning
was
leading
when
he
went
to
the
police
station,
did
you
see
the
two
defendants?
answer:
yes
i
did.
did
you
see
him
in
the
court
and
you
positively
identify,
i
agree
mr.
justice
rehnquist
but
still
the
--
for
defense
counsel
he
knows
what
the
answer’s
going
to
be.
he
knows
he
is
going
to
say,
yes,
so
maybe
for
trial
tactics
you
know
if
he
gets
up
and
objects
then
the
state’s
attorney
says
very
complainingly,
alright,
you
know,
they
does
it
very
painstakingly,
this
all
in
front
of
the
jury.
so,
in
any
of
event,
i
know
its
time
for
the
court
to
adjourn
in
--
i
just
want
to
make
one
point,
i
would
like
the
court
to
consider
why
this
case
should
not
be
summarily
reversed
and
to
avoid
the
problem
even
gained
to
gilbert-wade
and
even
stovall
for
the
state’s
concession,
when
i
considered
to
be
a
concession.
and
i’m
sure
they
may
have
an
answer
tomorrow
but
that
is
they
concede
in
my
mind
that
the
arrest
as
to
petitioner
was
illegal
because
in
order
to
avoid
the
force
of
wade
and
gilbert,
they
say
at
page
six
of
their
brief
that
this
identification
was
not
accusatory
but
was
rather
investigatory.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr
george
makes
the
argument
that
if
there
were
counsel
present
the
four
innocent
suspect
would
have
to
stay
in
custody
for
an
extra
few
hours.
now
bear
in
mind
that
in
this
case
mr.
kirby
received
a
sentence
of
5
to
12
years.
so
that
when
you
weigh
that
as
against
a
possible
delay
of
an
hour
in
order
to
obtain
counsel,
that
is
hardly
a
prejudice.
further
in
this
case
mr.
kirby
and
mr.
bean
were
in
custody
for
a
period
of
several
hours
while
they
waited
for
the
arrival
of
mr.
shard.
so
that
there
were
no
compelling
circumstances
in
this
case
where
the
state
--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that
i
am
very
confused
as
to
why
these
people
were
arrested
in
the
first
place.
i
think
that
when
they
got
--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
once
they
got
to
the
police
station,
they
found
that
these
checks
were
stolen,
they
did
have
probable
cause
in
my
judgment
clearly.
that
is
why
at
that
stage
they
had
probable
cause
to
arrest
them,
they
had
probable
cause
to
charge
you
and
they
did
charge
you.
that
is
why
for
state
of
illinois
to
argue
to
this
court
that
this
was
in
the
investigatory
stage
is
preposterous,
this
stage
because
i
had
the
probable
cause
was
in
a
critical
stage.
as
justice
brennan
said
in
his
decision
the
prosecution
had
focused
on
these
two
defendants
and
at
their
juncture
they
were
--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
i
do
not
mean
the
investigation
mr.
chief
justice.
i
mean
the
prosecution
because
they
had
probable
cause
to
arrest
him.
they
had
probable
cause
to
believe
that
they
had
committed
a
crime.
therefore,
it
was
no
longer
investigatory,
it
was
accusatory.
they
were
bringing
mr.
shard
in
to
nail
down
their
case.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
i
think
--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
i
think
he
had
reasonable
grounds.
if
you
believe
the
police
for
this
case,
he
had
reasonable
grounds
to
arrest
mr.
kirby
because
he
thought
he
was
alfanso
hemptom(ph)
wanted
not
for
confidence
gain.
so
if
you
believe
that
he
had
reasonable
grounds
to
arrest
him,
he
also
had
reasonable
grounds
to
arrest
them.
as
the
illinois
appellate
court
found
because
of
the
conflicting
stories.
therefore,
when
he
got
to
the
police
station
and
found
that
in
fact
a
robbery
had
been
committed,
this
case
is
fully
covered
by
wade
and
gilbert
because
the
focus
of
the
police
had
shifted
from
an
investigatory
to
accusatory.
this
was
now
in
the
critical
stage
and
this
whole
trial
was
going
to
be
determined
not
in
the
courtroom
but
when
mr.
shard
was
brought
into
the
squad
room.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
i
do.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
the
state
of
illinois
does,
the
state
of
california
does,
otherwise,
they
won't
be
standing
before
this
court
in
arguing
that
this
court
should
overrule
a
decision
only
four
years
old.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
the
supreme
court
--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
question
the
state
of
california
does
not
agree
in
6-1
decision.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
yes,
but
mr.
justice
stewart,
all
of
the
federal
courts
who
have
considered,
which
have
considered
this
question,
the
majority
of
the
states
which
have
considered
this
question.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
and
it
is
our
petition
mr.
justice
stewart
that
when
you
look
at
the
philosophy
of
wade
and
gilbert,
that
clue,
wade
and
gilbert
must
cover
pre-indictment
situations
that
those
are
critical
stages
of
the
prosecution
and
that
the
defendant
cannot
be
allowed
to
standalone
with
the
deck
stack
against
him
without
counsel.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
it
is
our
position
that
when
they
retreat,
when
illinois
and
california
retreats
from
an
overruling
of
wade
and
gilbert,
and
state
that
wade
and
gilbert
should
be
limited
to
post-indictment
cases
that
we
say
that
the
state
of
california,
supreme
court
decisions
6-1
and
following
apply
in
wade
and
gilbert
to
pre-indictment
situations
is
correct.
that
all
of
the
federal
court
should
consider
this
case,
applying
wade
and
gilbert
to
pre-indictment
situations
are
correct
because
after
all
99.9%
of
the
lineup
cases
happen
prior
to
indictment.
now
you
take
this
case,
for
example,
these
men
were
not
appointed
counsel
for
eight
weeks.
their
right
to
counsel
at
a
preliminary
hearing
was
violated.
let
us
assume
there
was
a
lineup
right
before
after
the
preliminary
hearing
but
still
no
indictment.
now
under
the
rationale
of
california
and
illinois,
mr.
kirby
would
not
have
the
protection
of
wade
and
gilbert.
in
this
case,
the
man
will
arrest.
you
would
had
a
waiting
in
the
police
station
for
several
hours.
the
state
of
illinois
could
show
no
prejudice
to
having
an
attorney
present.
they
say
an
attorney
would
be
harmful.
i
don't
believe
that
the
attorney
would
help
in
the
search
for
the
truth.
now
these
two
gentleman,
two
negroes
were
seated
in
the
squad
rooms
between
two
white
police
officers.
and
the
state
of
illinois
says,
that
this
was
an
instantaneous
identification
when
the
record
says
they
asked
if
the
two
negroes
were
his
assailants
and
mr.
wall(ph)
in
his
book
and
identification
which
the
court
cites
in
wade
says
this
is
the
most
grossly
suggested
procedure,
now
known
or
ever
known
to
the
police.
now
what
could
have
a
lawyer
done
in
this
case?
he
could
have
said
to
the
police,
please
have
the
lineup,
please
let's
get
at
least
four
or
five
other
negroes
into
the
room,
and
let
them
try
and
pick
from
five
or
six
negroes,
not
from
two
white
police
officers
and
two
negroes,
what
type
of
justice
is
that?
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
that
is
correct.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
well,
mr.
justice
stewart,
it
seems
to
me
without
complaining
that
i
would
be
unfairly
treated
for,
that
is
mr.
kirby
would
be
unfairly
treated
for
the
state
of
illinois
to
say
and
the
state
of
california,
you
do
not
need
wade
and
gilbert
to
protect
the
defendant
because
you
have
stovall
but
poor
mr.
kirby
doesn't
have
the
benefit
of
stovall
because
the
grant
of
certiorari
did
not
carry
that
far.
that
would
indeed
be
an
anomalous
result.
if
you
do
not
apply
wade
and
gilbert
and
say
if
the
gentleman
and
the
attorney,
because
there
was
no
compelling
circumstances
here
to
provide
him
an
attorney,
then
at
very
least,
the
court
must
apply
stovall
otherwise
it
would
be
the
most
rank
form
of
injustice.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
mr.
chief
justice,
the
strict
holding
as
we
have
learned
in
law
school,
that
wade
and
gilbert
are
limited
to
post-indictment
cases
because
that
was
the
fact
of
the
case.
my
position
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
when
you
read
the
broad
language
of
wade
and
gilbert,
the
rationale
for
the
decision,
the
reasons
underlying
the
decision
and
the
language
itself,
brings
you
to
the
conclusion
that
the
supreme
court
of
california
reached
and
all
the
federal
courts
have
reached,
and
that
is
that
the
philosophy
of
that
decision
is
that
it
applies
to
pre-indictment
cases.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
again
heard
on
re-argument
that
takes
us
back
to,
after
listening
to
the
last
arguments,
more
simplistic
questions
of
criminal
law
and
involves
the
proper
application
of
gilbert
and
wade
to
pre-indictment
identification
proceedings.
and
i
use
the
term
pre-indictment
identification
proceedings
because
there
was
no
lineup
as
such
in
this
case.
we
should
also
bear
in
mind
that
the
facts
of
this
case
pertaining
to
a
case
where
the
defendant
has
been
arrested
and
he
is
in
police
custody,
and
the
identification
takes
place
at
the
police
station.
i
assume
for
the
purpose
of
my
argument
that
we
are
dealing
with
the
petitioner’s
right
to
counsel
under
the
sixth
amendment
and
that
the
identification
process
is
not
violative
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self-incrimination
because
this
court
decided
in
wade
and
gilbert,
that
such
identification
and
proceedings
did
not
abridge
the
defendant’s
privilege
against
self
incrimination.
so
i
will
be
restricting
my
argument
to
petitioner’s
right
under
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
that
is
correct,
justice
stewart
but
i
think
is
illinois
argues
in
its
brief
that
in
deciding
the
case
would
be
within
the
discretion
of
the
court
to
say
if
the
court
we’re
to
say
that
we
do
not
have
to
reach
the
gilbert
and
wade
question
because
this
identification
was
so
violative
of
due
process
that
it
comes
within
stovall,
i
think
that
clearly
would
be
within
the
province
in
jurisdiction
and
quite
proper
within
the
grant
of
certiorari
in
this
case
to
take
that
view.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
no,
we
do
not,
i
do
not
believe.
i’ll
double
check
but
i
think
our
separate
questions
were
dealing
with
the
propriety
of
the
arrest
and
the
propriety
of
the
search
and
seizure.
i
will
check
(voice
overlap)
certiorari
petition,
but
i
might
point
that
i
believe
in
all
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
dealing
with
this
question,
this
court
always
ends
up
with
the
stovall
issue
in
any
event.
the
court
may
say
we
will
not
apply
wade
and
gilbert
retroactively
or
we
will
apply
it
retroactively
and
the
court
looks
at
the
stovall
issue.
now,
i
think
that
it
would
be
proper
for
the
court
in
this
case
to
look
at
the
stovall
issue.
and
my
--
this
the
same,
my
associate
points
out
that
the
first
question
in
our
petition
was
that
the
identification
should
have
been
by
means
of
a
lineup
that
there
were
not
compelling
circumstances
just
to
find
a
show
up.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
peripherally
that
is
a
stovall
claim
but
it’s
my
position
mr.
justice
stewart
that
this
court
could
under
the
grant
of
certiorari
look
at
the
stovall
issue.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
you
did
decline
to
accept
that
question
as
barely
drawn.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
well,
i
think
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
in
reading
the
decisions
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
they
say
two
things,
they
say
that
we
will
not
apply
gilbert
and
wade
to
pre-indictment
identifications
and
then
they
will
look
in
a
proper
case
to
see
whether
stovall
versus
denno
is
applicable
and
they
will
look
to
the
facts
of
a
particular
case.
now,
the
illinois
supreme
court
refused
to
do
that
in
this
case
by
refusing
to
grant
our
petition
for
leave
to
appeal.
this
case
comes
before
this
court
from
the
decision
of
the
illinois
appellate
court.
and
analyzing
the
facts
in
this
case,
its
also
important
to
bear
in
mind,
the
petitioner
was
an
indigent
person
throughout
the
course
of
the
illinois
proceedings,
being
represented
in
a
criminal
court
by
the
public
defender
and
then
in
the
illinois
appellate
court
by
court-appointed
counsel,
mr.
sang
(ph).
we
have
followed
the
case
to
this
court.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
no!
your
honor
it
can
be
no
question
mr.
justice
stewart
that
there
was
an
--
in
--
a
separate
in
court
identification
as
i
will
get
to
him
my
argument,
the
in-court
identification
was
wholly
dependent
upon
the
police
station
identification,
they
--
the
view
of
the
illinois
appellate
court
was
rather
that
the
victim
in
this
case
had
a
sufficient
opportunity
to
observe
this
assailant
and
i
will
go
into
those
facts
before
this
court
because
it
think
that
conclusion
is
not
sustained
by
the
record
that
the
--
you
cannot
say
that
the
victim
in
this
case
had
an
ample
opportunity,
he
did
--
had
never
seen
this
gentlemen
before
in
his
life?
at
the
most
he
only
had
a
few
seconds
to
observe
them
and
that
as
whole
identification
came
from
the
police
station
identification
which
as
i
will
show
is
rankly
violative
of
stovall
but
since
again
mr.
justice
stewart
since
you
raise
the
question,
illinois
assumes
that
that
issue
is
before
this
court
at
least
collaterally
by
saying
at
page
42
of
their
brief,
that
this
court
can
overrule
gilbert
and
wade
by
looking
to
the
holding
stovall
and
by
applying
to
this
case
in
all
other
cases.
the
stovall
test
of
whether
the
identification
is
so
ranked
and
so
pre
assess
to
violate
due
process,
so
i
submit
that
that
issue
one
way
or
another
passed
to
be
before
the
court
in
deciding
this
case.
after
he
kept
--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
the
identification
mr.
chief
justice
before
the
courtroom
identification,
the
courtroom
identification
is
always
very
dignified,
is
also
very
rote.
you
have
to
understand
it’s
what
--
is
made
by
rote,
the
witness
has
no
really
choice
in
the
courtroom
because
of
the
geographic
location
of
everybody.
when
you
have
a
trial
in
the
criminal
court
of
cook
county
and
the
witness
is
on
the
stand
and
the
--
the
witness
was
asked,
he
was
asked
in
this
case,
do
you
see
your
assailants?
the
witness
looks
around,
he
has
the
judge
to
his
left,
he
has
the
jutry
to
the
right
--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
that
is
--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
i
am
saying
mr.
chief
justice
that
for
my
very
realistic
point
of
view,
there
is
something
unreliable
because
the
witness
understands,
sees
the
prosecutor
--
he
sees
the
defense
counsel
has
rested
a
nice
suit
and
he
sees
the
defendant
in
90%
over
the
cases,
an
indigent
person,
the
defendant
is
not
out
on
bail,
he
is
surrounded
by
the
bailers
wearing
a
badge,
they
are
sitting
around
him,
and
naturally
he
will
pick
out
the
defendant,
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
was
a
case
in
cook
county
about
a
year
ago,
where
the
public
defender
brought
in
to
the
courtroom
by
some
ruse
a
different
defendant,
in
another
case
and
the
witness
picked
out
that
defendant
as
his
assailant.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
no,
i
do
not
mr.
chief
justice,
i
only
point
out
that
because
of
that
reality
of
any
criminal
case
that
the
pre
trial
identification
is
the
crucial
identification.
that
is
the
identification
as
this
court
said
in
gilbert,
as
this
court
said
in
wade
will
determine
that
faith
of
the
accused.
if
he
is
identified
improperly
in
the
police
station
that
identification
is
going
to
take
all
the
way
through
to
the
trial.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
yes.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
you
are
entirely
correct.
illinois
has
a
patterned
jury
instruction
which
we
have
on
your
criminal
cases
which
points
out
that
the
jury
is
entitled
to
consider
the
opportunity
to
observe
the
defendant
and
circumstances
such
as
that,
but
the
impartial
so
to
speak,
identification
of
an
accused
by
the
victim
on
the
stand
is
the
most
hoped
evidence
that
the
prosecution
has
in
its
arsenal
in
convicting
a
defendant.
in
my
judgment,
in
experience
which
is
limited
to
appointed
cases
but
in
my
experience
that
type
of
evidence
is
much
more
legal
to
the
defendant
than
as
a
confession
from
its
own
mouth.
when
you
have
a
witness
who
gets
on
the
stand,
and
says
that
is
the
man
who
held
me
up,
that
is
the
man
who
robbed
me,
it
is
very
difficult
to
get
a
jury
to
disbelieve
that
witness.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
it
is
much
more
aggravated.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
right.
when
i
say
its
an
infirmity
of
unreliability,
i
am
not
suggesting
mr.
chief
that
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
that
you
have
a
lineup
so
to
speak
although
that
would
certainly,
if
you’re
speaking
about
realities,
mr.
chief
justice
of
a
criminal
trial
that
would
certainly
be
much
more
reliable
than
asking
the
witness,
does
he
or
she
see
his
assailant
her
assailant
in
the
courtroom
when
there
is
only
one
person
from
whom
the
witness
can
pick
out.
he
has
to
pick
out
the
defendant.
there
is
no
one
else
there.
it
would
be
much
more
reliable
i
suppose
if
you
had
a
lineup
in
the
courtroom
and
then
i
would
like
to
see
if
the
defendant
was
protected
by
not
having
the
witnesses
seeing
their
picture.
how
many
victims
could
pick
out
their
assailants?
i
think
you
would
see
an
entirely
different
result
but
since
we
do
not
do
that
in
the
trial
in
our
criminal
cases
and
i
have
seen
very
few
judges
who
allow
you
to
do
that
other
than
in
preliminary
hearings.
i
submit
that
it
is
particularly
important
that
we
protect
the
pre
trial
identification
proceeding
to
make
sure
that
that
was
not
tainted.
now
jumping
ahead
of
my
story
for
a
second
to
point
out
that
what
happened
in
this
case
was
that
the
defendant
and
his
codefendant
were
sitting
in
a
squad
in
the
city
of
chicago
police
station
between
their
two
arresting
officers.
the
complainant
had
said
that
the
assailants
were
negro,
the
two
defendants
were
negro,
the
two
officers
were
white
and
the
victim
was
brought
in
and
said,
point
out
your
assailants.
well,
that
is
highly
a
very
fair
way
to
conduct
an
identification
proceedings.
he
could
either
pick
amongst
the
two
negro
defendants
or
the
two
white
police
officers.
and
when
you
have
that
type
of
identification
in
the
absence
of
counsel
and
that
is
what
you
will
have
in
the
absence
of
counsel,
because
these
police
officers
were
not
raw
rookies
they
have
on
the
force
eleven
years,
they
knew
better
and
they
conducted
this
type
of
identification
proceeding
either
because
they
were
lazy
or
because
they
were
indifferent
to
the
defendants’
rights.
i
don’t
really
believe
that
these
police
officers
were
trying
to
railroad
this
defendants,
this
wasn’t
a
hot
case.
this
was
just
an
ordinary
robbery.
they
happened
to
--
onto
these
defendants
and
unless
you
have
counsel
present,
then
you
are
not
going
to
have
a
fair
identification
proceeding.
now
to
go
back
to
the
facts
of
the
case,
on
february
20,
1968,
at
approximately
4:30
pm,
the
victim
in
this
case
mr.
shard,
had
recently
returned
from
trip
to
orleans,
it
was
late
afternoon,
he
was
walking
down
the
street
on
the
west
side
of
chicago.
the
record
doesn’t
disclose
bit
from
the
neighborhood
in
which
mr.
shard
live
in,
i
believe
that
it’s
a
fair
assumption
that
he
is
also
a
negro.
he
stated
that
he
noticed
two
men
behind
him,
at
about
15
feet
behind
him,
and
that
the
next
thing
he
knew
as
he
was
about
to
cross
the
street
to
go
to
a
restaurant,
he
was
grabbed
from
behind,
he
did
not
know
who
grabbed
him
from
behind.
they
held
him,
they
took
his
wallet.
his
wallet
contained
$140.00
and
traveler’s
checks,
$30
to
$35
of
cash
and
certain
identification
papers.
he
went
one
direction.
his
assailants
went
the
other
direction.
the
record
does
not
disclose
what
time
elapsed
but
we
can
assume
that
since
this
happened
on
the
street,
that
it
happened
pretty
rapidly.
mr.
shard,
the
victim
did
not
report
this
occurrence
to
the
city
of
chicago
police
till
the
next
day.
at
that
time,
he
gave
only
the
most
general
of
descriptions
to
the
police.
on
the
very
next
day,
february
22,
two
city
of
chicago
police
officers
were
cruising
in
a
non-marked
car
on
the
west
side
of
chicago.
they
had
no
knowledge
whatsoever
of
this
crime.
they
were
totally
ignorant
of
the
crime,
and
they
happened
to
see
the
petitioner,
mr.
kirby
walking
on
the
street
with
mr.
bean
who
was
eventually
to
be
his
codefendant.
now
this
was
february
1968
and
one
officer
had
in
his
possession
a
flyer
which
said
that
one,
alfonso
hampton,
was
wanted
for
a
competent
escape
and
he
said
to
his
partner,
see
that
fellow,
he
looks
like
hampton.
now
the
flyer
described
hampton
as
being
five
foot,
two
inches
tall
and
the
same
officer
testified
in
court,
the
petitioner
was
5
foot,
5
inches
in
height.
but
in
any
event,
he
stopped
petitioner
and
bean,
and
he
said
are
you
hampton
and
petitioner
kirby
said,
no
i
am
not,
he
said,
let
me
see
your
identification
papers.
so
petitioner
took
out
his
wallet,
started
to
show
the
officers
the
identification
papers
identifying
himself,
this
time
its
kirby
and
the
officer
testified
he
saw
some
traveler’s
checks
in
his
wallet
and
he
saw
the
name
willie
and
he
asked
petitioner
what
those
traveler’s
and
petitioner
responded
that
it
was
play
money.
now
the
officer
testified
that
he
thereafter
asked
petitioner
to
give
them
the
checks.
his
partner
testified
that
this
officer
took
the
checks
himself
out
of
the
wallet
and
there
he
saw
the
full
name
willie
shard.
now
bear
in
mind
he
still
did
not
know
that
a
robbery
had
taken
place,
but
he
said,
where
did
you
get
the
traveler’s
checks?
and
the
petitioner
said,
i
won
them
in
a
crap
game.
they
searched
the
other
codefendant
and
they
found
some
identifications
papers
also
bearing
the
name
willie
shard,
petitioner
had
identification
papers
bearing
the
name
willie
shard
and
they
were
taken
to
the
police
station,
put
under
arrest.
i
don’t
now
whether
they
were
arrested
for
a
robbery
of
mr.
shard
because
the
officers
didn’t
know
that
this
robbery
had
taken
place
or
whether
they
were
arrested
because
the
officers
thought
he
was
hampton
wanted
for
the
(inaudible)
some
nine
months
ago.
the
record
doesn’t
disclose
what
happened
when
they
got
to
the
police
station
in
terms
of
whether
the
police
determined
that
hampton
was
or
was
not
still
at
large.
in
any
event
they
checked
the
records,
they
found
that
mr.
shard
had
been
robbed
and
they
called
up,
contact
another
officer
who
proceeded
in
bringing
mr.
shard
to
the
police
station.
now,
it
now
it
took
several
hours
to
bring
mr.
shard
to
the
police
station.
under
illinois
law,
petitioner
had
the
right
to
consult
with
counsel.
if
petitioner
were
a
rich
man,
his
lawyer
would
have
been
there
within
a
matter
of
five
or
ten
minutes,
but
he
had
no
money
and
he
was
not
advised
of
his
right
to
counsel
although
that
is
his
statutory
right
under
illinois
law,
to
consult
with
counsel
as
soon
as
he
is
arrested
for
as
many
times
as
he
wishes.
he
was
not
advised
of
this
right.
while
they
waited
several
hours
for
mr.
shard
to
came
in
to
the
squad
room
and
there
were
the
two
white
police
officers,
there
were
the
two
negro
defendants,
mr.
shard
was
asked,
if
they
were
his
assailants?
he
said,
yes,
whereupon
the
state
not
very
rapidly
proceeded
to
bring
this
matter
to
indictment.
there
was
a
preliminary
hearing
held
on
this
days.
some
five
weeks
later,
on
march
25,
again
in
direct
violation
of
illinois
law,
counsel
was
not
appointed
to
represent
petitioner
at
this
preliminary
hearing.
this
isn’t
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
this
is
a
matter
of
illinois
statute
as
at
a
preliminary
hearing
the
defendant
shall
have
counsel
appointed
to
representative.
no
counsel
was
appointed.
petitioner
bean
were
indicted
on
april
20
--
on
april
8,
they
were
arraigned
on
april
16
some
eight
weeks
following
their
arrest.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
clearly,
mr.
justice
brennan
as
i
will
develop
in
a
minute,
it
was
really
crucial
for
their
defense
and
yet
even
under
the
states
attorney’s
examination
we
will
see
that
damaging
evidence
was
elicited
from
the
complainant.
so
some
eight
weeks
later
we
finally
have
counsel
appointed.
appointed
council
filed
on
behalf
on
both
defendants
a
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence.
a
motion
to
suppress
the
station
house
identification,
these
were
denied.
the
jury
found
the
defendants
guilty.
they
were
given
a
term
of
five
to
12
years.
i
might
point
out
because
it
is
significant
in
the
case
of
mr.
bean
that
an
appeal
to
the
illinois
appellate
court,
the
state
of
illinois
conceded
for
the
first
time
that
his
arrest
was
indeed
illegal
and
based
upon
that
concession
the
illinois
appellate
court
reversed
the
conviction
outright,
they
said,
they
have
no
right
to
detain
them,
they
had
no
right
to
identify
him,
therefore
there
was
no
other
evidence
to
convict
bean
on
and
they
reversed
the
case
outright.
now
we
should
get
some
facts
in
clear
focus.
the
state
of
illinois
and
the
state
of
california’s
amicus
in
their
brief,
contend,
may
it
please
the
court
that
this
assailant
had
a
chance
to
have
a
clear
view
and
a
long
time
to
observe
there
--
his
assailants
so
that
there
could
be
no
question
as
the
identification.
i
want
to
point
out
in
that
connection
that
mr.
shard’s
identification
to
the
police,
the
very
day
after
the
robbery
was
that
he
described
both
defendants
in
the
same
manner
identically
that
they’re
both
between
5’
6”
and
5’7”,
that
they
both
weight
between
a
140
and
150
pounds
and
that
they
were
both
dark
brown
skin.
no
further
description
was
given
according
to
this
record
of
these
defendants
and
at
the
trial,
mr.
shard
was
asked,
i
read
from
page
23
of
the
record,
did
you
tell
the
police
what
they
were
wearing
or
anything?
answer,
well,
no.
i
did
not
directly
see
what
they
was
wearing,
how
they
was
dresses.
question,
you
did
not
observe
what
they
were
wearing
regarding
their
clothing,
trousers
or
anything?
answer,
right.
question,
you
did
not
see
what
they
were
wearing?
answer,
no.
so
that
the
victim
did
not
even
have
the
opportunity
to
see
anything
about
how
his
assailants
were
dressed
and
bear
in
mind
he
first
saw
him
15
feet
away
and
did
not
pay
any
attention
to
them.
he
was
grabbed
from
behind,
they
took
his
wallet
and
then
he
went
in
one
direction,
his
assailants
went
another
direction.
and
yet
--
and
the
state
argues
because
they
have
mr.
shard
crying
for
the
trial
that
he
had
a
good
opportunity
to
observe
his
assailants.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
mr.
chief
justice
we
do
not
have
the
full
record
here.
normally
--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
that
instruction
under
my
knowledge
and
i
will
check
it
overnight
is
not
given
in
the
robbery
case,
it
was
given
in
the
burglary
case,
it
is
given
in
the
theft
case,
i
do
not
believe
that
that
instruction
is
given
in
the
robbery
case
but
i
will
check
that
mr.
chief
justice.
so
that
there
would
not
in
any
event,
however
mr.
chief
justice,
be
a
sufficient
record
to
convict
either
of
these
defendants
if
you
did
not
have
an
identification,
in
other
words,
under
illinois
law,
i’m
sure
the
state
of
illinois
will
concede
because
there
was
an
outright
reversal
by
the
illinois
appellate
court
as
to
defendant
bean
that
the
mere
possession
of
stolen
property
might
unexplained
support
another
charge,
its
certainly
mr.
chef
justice,
would
not
support
in
illinois
absence
any
another
proof
they
charge
a
robbery.
you
need
something
further
than
the
mere
possession
of
stolen
property
in
order
to
convict
the
man
of
robbery.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
no.
once
you
had
the
admissibility
mr.
justice
rehnquist
of
the
identification
by
the
victim
of
his
assailants,
once
you
have
that,
then
there
certainly
wasn’t
enough
sufficient
evidence
to
convict
these
defendants
if
you
knocked
out,
it
should
have
been
knocked
out.
the
station
house
identification
upon
which
the
in
court
identification
was
based
then
he
would
not
have
sufficient
evidence
to
convict.
under
no
ones
imagination
would
there
be
sufficient
evidence.
the
whole
case
hinged
upon
the
station
house
identification
law.
the
whole
case
rose
and
fall
--
fell
on
that
identification.
if
that
identification
was
out
as
the
illinois
appellate
court
held,
we
should’ve
been
in
bean’s
case
they
reversed
the
case
outright,
they
did
not
even
send
it
back
for
a
new
trial.
they
just
released
mr.
bean.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
yes
it
was
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
well,
i’m
saying
the
possession
--
the
reason
--
possession
of
the
traveler’s
checks
and
the
identification
papers
that
was
one
item
of
evidence
and
the
other
item
of
evidence,
the
crucial
item
of
evidence
was
the
station
house
identification
which
was
repeated
in
the
courtroom,
but
if
you
knocked
out
station
house
identification
and
all
you
have
is
the
possession
of
the
traveler’s
checks
and
identification
papers
then
that
is
not
sufficient
to
support
a
conviction
of
robbery.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
if
you
view
that
as
a
corroboration,
that
is
correct.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
well
i
don’t
know
as
in
any
case,
there
can
be,
you
know
an
explanation
mr.
bean
gave
an
explanation
he
said
they
found
the
traveler’s
check
and
the
identification
papers
in
an
alley
some
two
hours
before
they
were
arrested.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
there
was,
once
you
admit
the
legality
of
the
identification,
then
there
was
sufficient
basis
for
the
conviction.
if
you
knocked
out
the
identification
or
your
left
this
the
reason
possession
of
the
stolen
property
and
that
is
the
illinois
appellate
court
held
was
not
sufficient
to
sustain
the
conviction
and
that’s
all
the
evidence
there
was
in
this
case.
this
was
a
jury
case
they
were
starting
to
complete
in
one
day.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
my
petitioner,
your
honor
stated
--
gave
two
explanations
to
the
police
and
that
is
his
first,
was
before
the
police
officer
saw
the
entire
traveler’s
checks
he
said
it
was
play
money,
he
then
said
that
it
was
won
in
the
crap
game.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
that
was
the
codefendant
mr.
bean
who
was
--
who
in
the
state
of
illinois
before
the
illinois
appellate
court
conceded
was
arrested
illegally
and
the
illinois
appellate
court
reversed
this
condition
outright
mr.
chief
justice
so
that
case
is
not
before
this
court,
mr.
bean
just
his
codefendant
as
well.
now,
i
want
to
point
out
what
happened
in
the
station
house
identification
in
this
case
because
i
think
all
the
ills
that
this
court
perceived
in
gilbert
and
wade
came
true
in
this
case.
mr.
shard
was
contacted
by
a
third
police
officer.
he
was
asked
if
he
was
robbed.
he
was
asked
if
he
could
identify
his
assailants.
he
was
told
that
they
had
two
suspects
in
custody
and
he
was
brought
to
the
police
station.
now
the
state
of
illinois
and
the
state
of
california’s
amicus
would
lead
this
court
to
believe
that
mr.
shard
walked
in
to
the
police
station
and
made
this
spontaneous
identification
of
his
assailants.
they
walked
in
and
said
those
are
the
men.
now
the
record
is
quite
to
the
contrary.
reading
at
page
24,
this
is
when
mr.
shard
testified
at
the
trial,
then
running
on
to
page
25.
question:
did
the
police
officer
anything
to
you?
answer:
they
asked
me
to
point
them
out
and
i
pointed
them
two
guys
out.
question:
they
asked
you
if
these
were
the
ones.
answer:
right.
question:
how
many
other
people
were
sitting
there?
answer:
i
did
not
pay
much
attention.
question:
they
asked
you
if
these
two
kirby
and
bean
were
the
one,
correct.
answer:
yes.
then
a
little
later
because
there
was
four
people
in
the
room,
two
white
officers
and
two
negro
defendants,
the
defense
counsel
said,
did
he
asked
you
about
the
other
ones
to
which
the
--
mr.
shard
said
no,
they
just
asked
me
if
kirby
and
bean
were
the
ones
and
i
said
they
were.
so
i
submit
that
there
was
no
spontaneous
identification.
that
the
identification
was
based
solely
upon
the
fact
that
you
had
two
white
officers
and
two
negro
defendants
and
if
that
is
a
lineup,
then
if
that
is
identification
then
the
criminal
process
in
this
country
has
come
to
a
very
sad
state.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
they’re
both
negro,
your
honor.
both
shard
--
shard
is
--
as
i
state
--
at
the
beginning
of
my
argument
mr.
justice
stewart
the
record
doesn’t
disclose
but
from
the
address
in
which
he
lives
and
my
knowledge
of
the
city
of
chicago
i
would
say
he
was
a
negro.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
he
--
mr.
--
if
it
may
please
court
mr.
chief
justice,
he
didn’t
--
he’d
never
seen
bean
and
kirby
before.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
i
don’t
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
the
record
doesn’t
disclose
that.
i
do
want
to
point
out
that
there
was
no
independent
in
court
identification
in
this
case.
the
record
at
page
21
shows
that
at
the
trial,
shard
was
asked,
question:
when
you
went
to
the
police
station
did
you
see
the
two
defendants?
answer:
yes
i
did.
question:
do
you
see
them
in
court
today?
answer:
yes
sir.
question:
point
them
out
please.
answer:
yes,
that
one
and
the
other
one,
indicating
shard
and
bean.
question:
and
you
positively
identified
them
at
the
police
station,
is
that
correct?
answer:
yes.
so
that
you
have
a
perfect
case
fitting
within
all
force
of
gilbert.
i
submit
that
the
state
of
illinois
and
the
state
of
california
impliedly
concede
that
gilbert
and
wade
apply
to
pre-indictment
identification
proceedings
since
they
asked
that
this
court
overturned
those
decisions.
i
do
not
believe
that
california
and
illinois
would
take
that
position
unless
they
really
admitted
and
really
knew
that
gilbert
and
wade
by
its
force,
by
its
language,
by
its
rationale,
by
its
philosophy
must
by
force
applied
to
pre-indictment
situations.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
certainly
mr.
justice
rehnquist
but
when
you
have
a
defense
counsel,
public
defender
who
is
highly
experienced,
they
try
hundreds
of
these
cases
more
than
i
will
try
in
a
lifetime,
he
knows
that
as
a
matter
of
trial
tactics
if
he
gets
up
and
objects
that
the
question
is
leading,
what
have
you
--
that
he
will
only
be
highlighting
in
exacerbating
the
problem,
so
as
a
matter
of
trial
tactics,
share
the
question
was
leading
but
as
a
matter
of
trial
fact
as
he
wanted
to
not
object.
i
don’t
know
the
public
defender
who
handled
this
case
that
is
only
my
supposition.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
i
--
the
whole
line
of
questioning
was
leading
when
he
went
to
the
police
station,
did
you
see
the
two
defendants?
answer:
yes
i
did.
did
you
see
him
in
the
court
and
you
positively
identify,
i
agree
mr.
justice
rehnquist
but
still
the
--
for
defense
counsel
he
knows
what
the
answer’s
going
to
be.
he
knows
he
is
going
to
say,
yes,
so
maybe
for
trial
tactics
you
know
if
he
gets
up
and
objects
then
the
state’s
attorney
says
very
complainingly,
alright,
you
know,
they
does
it
very
painstakingly,
this
all
in
front
of
the
jury.
so,
in
any
of
event,
i
know
its
time
for
the
court
to
adjourn
in
--
i
just
want
to
make
one
point,
i
would
like
the
court
to
consider
why
this
case
should
not
be
summarily
reversed
and
to
avoid
the
problem
even
gained
to
gilbert-wade
and
even
stovall
for
the
state’s
concession,
when
i
considered
to
be
a
concession.
and
i’m
sure
they
may
have
an
answer
tomorrow
but
that
is
they
concede
in
my
mind
that
the
arrest
as
to
petitioner
was
illegal
because
in
order
to
avoid
the
force
of
wade
and
gilbert,
they
say
at
page
six
of
their
brief
that
this
identification
was
not
accusatory
but
was
rather
investigatory.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr
george
makes
the
argument
that
if
there
were
counsel
present
the
four
innocent
suspect
would
have
to
stay
in
custody
for
an
extra
few
hours.
now
bear
in
mind
that
in
this
case
mr.
kirby
received
a
sentence
of
5
to
12
years.
so
that
when
you
weigh
that
as
against
a
possible
delay
of
an
hour
in
order
to
obtain
counsel,
that
is
hardly
a
prejudice.
further
in
this
case
mr.
kirby
and
mr.
bean
were
in
custody
for
a
period
of
several
hours
while
they
waited
for
the
arrival
of
mr.
shard.
so
that
there
were
no
compelling
circumstances
in
this
case
where
the
state
--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that
i
am
very
confused
as
to
why
these
people
were
arrested
in
the
first
place.
i
think
that
when
they
got
--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
once
they
got
to
the
police
station,
they
found
that
these
checks
were
stolen,
they
did
have
probable
cause
in
my
judgment
clearly.
that
is
why
at
that
stage
they
had
probable
cause
to
arrest
them,
they
had
probable
cause
to
charge
you
and
they
did
charge
you.
that
is
why
for
state
of
illinois
to
argue
to
this
court
that
this
was
in
the
investigatory
stage
is
preposterous,
this
stage
because
i
had
the
probable
cause
was
in
a
critical
stage.
as
justice
brennan
said
in
his
decision
the
prosecution
had
focused
on
these
two
defendants
and
at
their
juncture
they
were
--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
i
do
not
mean
the
investigation
mr.
chief
justice.
i
mean
the
prosecution
because
they
had
probable
cause
to
arrest
him.
they
had
probable
cause
to
believe
that
they
had
committed
a
crime.
therefore,
it
was
no
longer
investigatory,
it
was
accusatory.
they
were
bringing
mr.
shard
in
to
nail
down
their
case.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
i
think
--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
i
think
he
had
reasonable
grounds.
if
you
believe
the
police
for
this
case,
he
had
reasonable
grounds
to
arrest
mr.
kirby
because
he
thought
he
was
alfanso
hemptom(ph)
wanted
not
for
confidence
gain.
so
if
you
believe
that
he
had
reasonable
grounds
to
arrest
him,
he
also
had
reasonable
grounds
to
arrest
them.
as
the
illinois
appellate
court
found
because
of
the
conflicting
stories.
therefore,
when
he
got
to
the
police
station
and
found
that
in
fact
a
robbery
had
been
committed,
this
case
is
fully
covered
by
wade
and
gilbert
because
the
focus
of
the
police
had
shifted
from
an
investigatory
to
accusatory.
this
was
now
in
the
critical
stage
and
this
whole
trial
was
going
to
be
determined
not
in
the
courtroom
but
when
mr.
shard
was
brought
into
the
squad
room.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
i
do.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
the
state
of
illinois
does,
the
state
of
california
does,
otherwise,
they
won't
be
standing
before
this
court
in
arguing
that
this
court
should
overrule
a
decision
only
four
years
old.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
the
supreme
court
--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
question
the
state
of
california
does
not
agree
in
6-1
decision.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
yes,
but
mr.
justice
stewart,
all
of
the
federal
courts
who
have
considered,
which
have
considered
this
question,
the
majority
of
the
states
which
have
considered
this
question.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
and
it
is
our
petition
mr.
justice
stewart
that
when
you
look
at
the
philosophy
of
wade
and
gilbert,
that
clue,
wade
and
gilbert
must
cover
pre-indictment
situations
that
those
are
critical
stages
of
the
prosecution
and
that
the
defendant
cannot
be
allowed
to
standalone
with
the
deck
stack
against
him
without
counsel.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
it
is
our
position
that
when
they
retreat,
when
illinois
and
california
retreats
from
an
overruling
of
wade
and
gilbert,
and
state
that
wade
and
gilbert
should
be
limited
to
post-indictment
cases
that
we
say
that
the
state
of
california,
supreme
court
decisions
6-1
and
following
apply
in
wade
and
gilbert
to
pre-indictment
situations
is
correct.
that
all
of
the
federal
court
should
consider
this
case,
applying
wade
and
gilbert
to
pre-indictment
situations
are
correct
because
after
all
99.9%
of
the
lineup
cases
happen
prior
to
indictment.
now
you
take
this
case,
for
example,
these
men
were
not
appointed
counsel
for
eight
weeks.
their
right
to
counsel
at
a
preliminary
hearing
was
violated.
let
us
assume
there
was
a
lineup
right
before
after
the
preliminary
hearing
but
still
no
indictment.
now
under
the
rationale
of
california
and
illinois,
mr.
kirby
would
not
have
the
protection
of
wade
and
gilbert.
in
this
case,
the
man
will
arrest.
you
would
had
a
waiting
in
the
police
station
for
several
hours.
the
state
of
illinois
could
show
no
prejudice
to
having
an
attorney
present.
they
say
an
attorney
would
be
harmful.
i
don't
believe
that
the
attorney
would
help
in
the
search
for
the
truth.
now
these
two
gentleman,
two
negroes
were
seated
in
the
squad
rooms
between
two
white
police
officers.
and
the
state
of
illinois
says,
that
this
was
an
instantaneous
identification
when
the
record
says
they
asked
if
the
two
negroes
were
his
assailants
and
mr.
wall(ph)
in
his
book
and
identification
which
the
court
cites
in
wade
says
this
is
the
most
grossly
suggested
procedure,
now
known
or
ever
known
to
the
police.
now
what
could
have
a
lawyer
done
in
this
case?
he
could
have
said
to
the
police,
please
have
the
lineup,
please
let's
get
at
least
four
or
five
other
negroes
into
the
room,
and
let
them
try
and
pick
from
five
or
six
negroes,
not
from
two
white
police
officers
and
two
negroes,
what
type
of
justice
is
that?
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
that
is
correct.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
well,
mr.
justice
stewart,
it
seems
to
me
without
complaining
that
i
would
be
unfairly
treated
for,
that
is
mr.
kirby
would
be
unfairly
treated
for
the
state
of
illinois
to
say
and
the
state
of
california,
you
do
not
need
wade
and
gilbert
to
protect
the
defendant
because
you
have
stovall
but
poor
mr.
kirby
doesn't
have
the
benefit
of
stovall
because
the
grant
of
certiorari
did
not
carry
that
far.
that
would
indeed
be
an
anomalous
result.
if
you
do
not
apply
wade
and
gilbert
and
say
if
the
gentleman
and
the
attorney,
because
there
was
no
compelling
circumstances
here
to
provide
him
an
attorney,
then
at
very
least,
the
court
must
apply
stovall
otherwise
it
would
be
the
most
rank
form
of
injustice.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
mr.
chief
justice,
the
strict
holding
as
we
have
learned
in
law
school,
that
wade
and
gilbert
are
limited
to
post-indictment
cases
because
that
was
the
fact
of
the
case.
my
position
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
when
you
read
the
broad
language
of
wade
and
gilbert,
the
rationale
for
the
decision,
the
reasons
underlying
the
decision
and
the
language
itself,
brings
you
to
the
conclusion
that
the
supreme
court
of
california
reached
and
all
the
federal
courts
have
reached,
and
that
is
that
the
philosophy
of
that
decision
is
that
it
applies
to
pre-indictment
cases.
thank
you
very
much.
