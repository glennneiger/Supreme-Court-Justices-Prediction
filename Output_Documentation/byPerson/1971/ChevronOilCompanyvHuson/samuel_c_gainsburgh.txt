mr.
samuel
c.
gainsburgh
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
the
reason
or
one
of
the
reasons
that
my
friend
was
able
to
be
so
brief
is
that
he
has
a
prima
facie
case
on
his
side,
namely
the
rodrigue
decision
and
i
think
it
would
be
less
than
realistic
as
an
advocate,
if
we
did
not
acknowledge
that
this
is
so.
mr.
samuel
c.
gainsburgh
he
has
that.
(voice
overlap)
mr.
samuel
c.
gainsburgh
this
is
explicit
language
to
be
sure,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
c.
gainsburgh
i
think
there,
perhaps
is
more
than
a
little
merit
to
judge
brown’s
observation
in
this
particular
case.
if
for
instance,
we
subscribe
to
the
statement
in
rodrigue,
statements
i
should
say
as
i
read
the
decision,
that
congress
was
concerned
with
the
welfare
of
the
offshore
oil
worker,
the
amphibious
oil
worker
who
undoubtedly
is
subjective
to
a
rather
hazardous
environment
in
which
albeit
on
a
fixed
platform,
called
theoretically
an
artificial
island,
he
is
subjected
to
the
vagaries
of
the
sea,
of
wind,
wave
and
weather.
to
a
large
extent
the
equipment
with
which
he
works
is
affected
by
all
of
these
things.
in
this
particular
instance,
it
would
be
difficult
if
one
took
a
reasonable
view
of
these
circumstances,
not
to
conclude
that
sea
played
a
part
in
mr.
huson’s
injury,
albeit
it
happened
on
an
artificial
island.
if
as
the
court
suggests
in
rodrigue,
congress
was
concerned
with
the
protection
of
these
equal
groups,
undoubtedly
need
protection.
it
struck
judge
brown
apparently
as
it
should
be
apparent
i
would
think
to
anyone
who
compares
the
two
systems
of
law
that
under
the
maritime
law
which
incidentally
for
almost
a
decade
prior
to
rodrigue
in
a
number
of
cases
several
of
which
a
certiorari
had
been
denied
and
men
such
as
mr.
huson
were
allowed
to
have
the
benefits
of
the
general
maritime
law
when
injured
in
this
identical
situation.
and
a
brief
comparison
i
think
will
do
no
violence
to
the
court's
schedule.
i
would
simply
suggest
that
under
louisiana
law
for
instance,
if
a
man
and
under
the
law
of
most
states,
which
have
adopted
the
common
law
that
unfortunately
in
our
civil
jurisdiction
in
louisiana,
we
have
adopted
in
this
area,
assumption
of
risk
is
a
complete
bar
to
recovery.
under
the
maritime
law
such
would
not
be
the
case,
contributory
negligence
are
complete
bar
to
recovery
under
louisiana
law.
anomalous
as
it
maybe
as
civil
law
jurisdiction,
contributory
negligence
is
the
complete
bar.
contributory
negligence
is
not
a
complete
bar
under
maritime
law.
in
flexible
statutes
of
limitation
as
judge
brown
points
out
in
his
opinion,
“as
opposed
to
the
more
equitable
and
humane
consideration
of
laches,”
the
doctrine
which
judge
brown
allowed
mr.
huson
to
avail
of
himself
up
in
this
case.
the
degree
of
legal
duties
to
persons
on
the
premises
is
a
rather
tricky
thing
at
common
law
and
to
some
degree
in
louisiana
where
persons
are
classified
as
business
visitors,
invitees,
licensee’s.
these
are
the
problems
now
if
rodrigue
is
to
be
followed
of
the
offshore
oil
worker.
this
honorable
court
declared
in
cameric
(ph)
that
it
is
not
going
to
run
afoul
of
that
under
admiralty
law,
all
persons
lawfully
aboard
maritime
premises
would
be
entitled
to
the
duty
of
reasonable
care
from
the
operator
and
owner
of
those
premises.
particularly
is
this
important
in
the
tied
lands
where
much
of
the
work
that
goes
on,
on
these
high
seas
platforms
is
special
service
contract
and
i
think
that
these
are
some
of
the
considerations
that
we
are
going
through
to
judge
brown’s
mind
when
he
declared
that
he
ought
not
to
let
literalisms
any
more
than
he
had
to,
he
certainly
cannot
overrule
this
honorable
court
anymore
than
he
had
to
let
literalism
bring
about
results
which
he
considered
unsound.
mr.
samuel
c.
gainsburgh
sure.
mr.
samuel
c.
gainsburgh
i
think
that
the
record,
your
honor,
will
disclose
that
plaintiff,
the
much
time
is
slightly
two
years.
whether
this
is
much
time,
we
will
assume
that
it
is,
the
record
will
disclose
that
this
man
was
initially
injured
in
one
year
and
then
he
was
off
for
several
months,
receiving
treatment
and
then
allowed
to
go
back
to
work.
he
went
back
to
work.
he
had
much
more
sedentary
job,
but
it
was
a
more
convenient
job
instead
on
working
off
shore
as
he
had
been
doing,
he
was
a
dispatcher
and
he
got
along
very
well
at
this
job
with
no
problems
apparently
until
he
attempted
to
return
to
this
heavy
type
of
employment,
by
which
time
another
year
had
elapsed.
when
he
went
back
tried
to
continue,
he
had
a
recurrences,
the
record
will
reflect
that
references
are
made
in
our
brief
to
this
situation.
so
that
actually
this
suit
was
filed
within
a
year
of
the
time
that
this
man’s
injuries
apparently
became
permanently
disabling
to
him.
mr.
samuel
c.
gainsburgh
no,
this
is
the
review
of
the
maritime
law
that
a
person
who
can
show
these
things
and
who
had
shown
these
things
is
entitled
to
have
his
day
in
court
and
to
have
the
defendant’s
legal
liability
tested
for
it,
but
not
under
the
louisiana
law.
mr.
samuel
c.
gainsburgh
yes,
it
does,
literally.
mr.
samuel
c.
gainsburgh
your
honor,
our
position
is
that
the
rodrigue
decision
places
an
interpretation
on
the
lands
act
which
is
inconsistent
with
the
general
admiralty
and
maritime
jurisdiction
of
this
honorable
court
and
an
interpretation
which
is
not
necessary
to
bring
about
the
results
that
congress
apparently
intended.
we
feel
for
instance
that
the
inference
is
gone
by
the
court
in
rodrigue
--
mr.
samuel
c.
gainsburgh
yes,
your
honor,
but
i
would
not
particularly
would
seize
upon
the
opportunity
to
suggest
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
treat
these
high
seas
structures
as
vessels
in
order
to
make
the
man
aboard
them
seaman,
having
them
seaman
is
not
problem.
mr.
samuel
c.
gainsburgh
the
general
maritime
law
in
the
tort
area
would
serve,
i
respectfully
submit
to
this
court,
would
serve
to
achieve
the
ends
that
your
honors
attributed
to
congress
in
rodrigue,
namely
the
maximum
protection
of
the
offshore
worker.
mr.
samuel
c.
gainsburgh
it
certainly
is,
sir.
mr.
samuel
c.
gainsburgh
that
is
correct.
mr.
samuel
c.
gainsburgh
i
will
respectfully
suggest,
your
honor,
again
that
the
congress
said
that
they
did
not
intend
to
treat
them
as
vessels
and
we
submit
and
have
attempted
to
support
our
submission
in
our
brief
that
it
is
not
necessary
that
the
presence
of
a
vessel
is
not
indispensable
to
maritime
jurisdiction,
and
therefore,
we
believe
that
this
situation
is
no
different.
if
i
may
pose
this
hypothetical
proposition;
if
you
have
a
national
park,
totally
within
a
state,
an
area
of
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction,
totally
within
the
state,
through
which
ran
a
navigable
stream.
i
think
that
you
could
accommodate
certainly
the
contracts,
the
other
business
activities
that
went
on
in
the
park
and
apply
state
law
with
no
problems.
but
let
us
get
something
into
the
stream,
let
us
get
something
in
the
water,
let
us
put
something
at
sea
and
a
tort
occurs
there
which
traditionally
by
locality
would
be
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
admiralty.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
does
no
violence
to
rodrigue,
it
does
no
violence
to
the
lands
act
particularly,
to
apply
maritime
tort
principles
to
what
we
feel
by
their
very
nature
and
service
on
maritime
and
admiralty
premises.
and
this
is
really
the
brawn
of
our
brief.
we
realize
it
is
a
difficult
burden
to
carry,
if
we
have
to
get
that
far.
we
have
urged
to
this
court
as
we
did
in
the
court
below
that
even
if
your
honors
determined
not
to
reexamine
the
rodrigue
decision,
that
it
is
inequitable
in
this
situation.
although,
the
record
will
not
support
overt
reliance
on
snipes
and
ousley
and
the
pre
rodrigue
decisions,
but
if
it
is
manifestly
unfair
to
apply
this
rodrigue
decision
retroactively
in
this
particular
case
at
the
time
this
action
was
filed,
the
law
under
which
we
operated
and
had
been
operating
for
almost
a
decade
in
the
fifth
circuit,
was
that
laches
apply,
not
prescription.
there
was
no
compulsion
of
law
either
statutory
or
case
law.
it
was
all
to
the
contrary.
mr.
samuel
c.
gainsburgh
except
the
statutory
language,
which
the
fifth
circuit
had
interpreted
as
intending
to
apply
maritime
law
to
these
platforms.
of
course
as
your
honor
knows
that
fifth
circuit
in
the
snipes
case
interpreted
the
same
statute
which
was
later
interpreted
by
this
honorable
court
in
rodrigue.
they
just
came
to
different
conclusions,
but
the
litigants
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
i
assume
elsewhere,
certainly
would
have
a
right,
they
should
have
a
right
to
rely
upon
the
pronouncements
of
that
court,
not
once
but
in
at
least
four
different
cases,
three
of
which
i
think
were
denied
cert
by
this
honorable
court.
we
feel
that
this
not
the
only
matter
of
its
kind
in
the
fifth
circuit.
my
brother,
mr.
melancon
referred
to
some,
before
coming
here.
i
will
ascertain
that
there
are
actually
three
matters
pending
in
the
fifth
circuit
in
which
the
decision
is
being
withheld,
dealing
solely
with
cases
filed
before
rodrigue
after
the
state
prescription,
dismissed
by
the
district
court
after
rodrigue
was
decided
and
now
on
appeal
to
the
fifth
circuit.
perhaps,
there
are
others
in
the
district
court
which
have
not
yet
reached
that
level
that
i
am
unable
to
canvass
without
a
great
deal
of
research,
but
those
three
do
exist
along
with
mr.
huson.
these
people
will
retroactively
lose
their
causes
of
action.
it
may
be
said
by
my
brother
that
they
never
had
it
in
the
beginning
so
they
cannot
lose
what
they
never
had.
but
this
is
a
retroactive
application
of
a
time
limitation
of
which
there
was
no
fair
warning
or
reason
given
in
view
of
snipes
and
ousley
and
the
other
cases
that
were
decided.
we
feel
that
in
summary
and
in
conclusion
that
the
language,
the
literal
verbiage
of
the
lands
act
does
not
compel
this
court
to
hold
that
that
congress
intended
to
take
out
of
maritime
jurisdiction
of
what
we
contend
was
a
part
of
the
general
maritime
law
of
the
united
states.
torts
occurring
on
the
high
seas
80,
some
80-90
or
125
miles
at
sea,
it
seems
to
us
are
certainly
fitting
subjects
for
admiralty
and
maritime
jurisdiction
traditionally
and
if
not
traditionally,
certainly
modernly
and
contemporaneously
as
our
aircraft
disasters
which
seem
to
have
the
blessing
of
admiralty
law.
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
samuel
c.
gainsburgh
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
the
reason
or
one
of
the
reasons
that
my
friend
was
able
to
be
so
brief
is
that
he
has
a
prima
facie
case
on
his
side,
namely
the
rodrigue
decision
and
i
think
it
would
be
less
than
realistic
as
an
advocate,
if
we
did
not
acknowledge
that
this
is
so.
mr.
samuel
c.
gainsburgh
he
has
that.
(voice

mr.
samuel
c.
gainsburgh
this
is
explicit
language
to
be
sure,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
c.
gainsburgh
i
think
there,
perhaps
is
more
than
a
little
merit
to
judge
brown’s
observation
in
this
particular
case.
if
for
instance,
we
subscribe
to
the
statement
in
rodrigue,
statements
i
should
say
as
i
read
the
decision,
that

to
a
large

the
equipment
with
which
he
works
is
affected
by
all
of
these
things.
in
this
particular
instance,
it
would
be
difficult
if
one
took
a
reasonable
view
of
these
circumstances,
not
to
conclude
that
sea
played
a
part
in
mr.
huson’s
injury,
albeit
it
happened
on
an
artificial
island.
if
as
the
court
suggests
in
rodrigue,
congress
was
concerned
with
the
protection
of
these
equal
groups,
undoubtedly
need
protection.
it
struck
judge
brown
apparently
as
it
should
be

i
would
think
to
anyone
who
compares
the
two
systems
of

incidentally
for
almost

in
a

of

several

as
mr.
huson
were
allowed
to

when
injured
in
this
identical
situation.
and
a
brief
comparison
i
think
will
do
no
violence
to
the
court's
schedule.
i
would
simply
suggest
that
under
louisiana
law
for
instance,
if
a
man
and
under
the
law
of
most
states,
which
have
adopted
the
common
law
that
unfortunately
in
our
civil
jurisdiction
in
louisiana,
we
have
adopted
in
this
area,
assumption
of
risk
is
a
complete
bar
to
recovery.
under
the
maritime
law
such
would
not
be
the
case,
contributory
negligence
are
complete
bar
to
recovery
under
louisiana
law.
anomalous
as
it
maybe
as
civil
law
jurisdiction,
contributory
negligence
is
the
complete
bar.
contributory
negligence
is
not
a
complete
bar
under
maritime
law.
in
flexible
statutes
of
limitation
as
judge
brown
points
out
in
his
opinion,
“as
opposed
to
the
more
equitable
and
humane
consideration
of
laches,”
the
doctrine
which
judge
brown
allowed
mr.
huson
to
avail
of
himself
up
in
this
case.
the
degree
of
legal
duties
to
persons
on
the
premises
is
a
rather
tricky
thing
at
common
law
and
to
some
degree
in
louisiana
where
persons
are
classified
as
business
visitors,
invitees,
licensee’s.
these
are
the
problems
now
if
rodrigue
is
to
be
followed
of
the
offshore
oil
worker.
this
honorable
court
declared
in
cameric
(ph)
that
it
is
not
going
to
run
afoul
of
that
under
admiralty
law,
all
persons
lawfully
aboard

would
be
entitled
to
the
duty
of
reasonable
care
from
the
operator
and
owner
of
those
premises.
particularly
is
this
important
in
the
tied
lands
where
much
of
the
work
that
goes
on,
on
these
high
seas
platforms
is
special
service
contract
and
i
think
that
these
are
some
of
the
considerations
that
we
are
going
through
to
judge
brown’s
mind
when
he
declared
that
he
ought
not
to

he
certainly
cannot
overrule
this
honorable

than
he
had
to

literalism
bring
about
results
which
he
considered
unsound.
mr.
samuel
c.
gainsburgh
sure.
mr.
samuel
c.
gainsburgh
i
think
that
the
record,
your
honor,
will
disclose
that
plaintiff,
the
much
time
is
slightly
two
years.
whether
this
is
much
time,
we
will
assume
that
it
is,
the
record
will
disclose
that
this
man
was
initially
injured
in
one

he

it

a
more

apparently
until

the
record
will
reflect
that

this
situation.
so
that
actually
this
suit
was
filed
within
a
year
of
the
time
that
this
man’s
injuries
apparently
became
permanently
disabling
to
him.
mr.
samuel
c.
gainsburgh
no,
this
is
the
review
of
the
maritime
law
that
a
person
who
can
show
these
things
and
who
had
shown
these
things
is
entitled
to
have
his
day
in
court
and
to
have
the
defendant’s
legal
liability
tested
for
it,
but
not
under
the
louisiana
law.
mr.
samuel
c.
gainsburgh
yes,
it
does,
literally.
mr.
samuel
c.
gainsburgh
your
honor,
our
position
is
that
the
rodrigue
decision
places
an
interpretation
on
the
lands
act
which
is
inconsistent
with
the
general
admiralty
and
maritime
jurisdiction
of
this
honorable
court
and
an
interpretation
which
is
not
necessary
to
bring
about
the
results
that
congress
apparently
intended.
we
feel
for
instance
that
the
inference
is
gone
by
the
court
in
rodrigue
--
mr.
samuel
c.
gainsburgh
yes,
your
honor,
but
i
would
not
particularly
would
seize
upon
the
opportunity
to
suggest
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
treat
these
high
seas
structures
as
vessels
in
order
to
make
the
man
aboard
them
seaman,
having
them
seaman
is
not
problem.
mr.
samuel
c.
gainsburgh
the
general
maritime
law
in
the
tort
area
would
serve,
i
respectfully
submit
to
this
court,
would
serve
to
achieve
the
ends
that
your
honors
attributed
to
congress
in
rodrigue,
namely
the
maximum
protection
of
the
offshore
worker.
mr.
samuel
c.
gainsburgh
it
certainly
is,
sir.
mr.
samuel
c.
gainsburgh
that
is
correct.
mr.
samuel
c.
gainsburgh
i
will
respectfully
suggest,
your
honor,
again
that
the
congress
said
that
they
did
not
intend
to
treat
them
as
vessels
and
we
submit
and
have
attempted
to
support
our
submission
in
our
brief
that
it
is
not
necessary
that
the
presence
of
a
vessel
is
not
indispensable
to
maritime
jurisdiction,
and
therefore,
we
believe
that
this
situation
is
no
different.
if
i
may
pose
this
hypothetical
proposition;
if
you
have
a
national
park,
totally
within
a
state,
an
area
of
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction,
totally
within
the
state,
through
which
ran
a
navigable
stream.
i
think
that
you
could
accommodate
certainly
the
contracts,
the
other
business
activities
that
went
on
in
the
park
and
apply
state
law
with
no
problems.
but
let
us
get
something
into
the
stream,
let
us
get
something
in
the
water,
let
us
put
something
at
sea
and
a
tort
occurs
there
which
traditionally
by
locality
would
be
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
admiralty.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
does
no
violence
to
rodrigue,
it
does
no
violence
to
the
lands
act
particularly,
to
apply
maritime
tort
principles
to
what
we
feel
by
their
very
nature
and
service
on
maritime
and
admiralty
premises.
and
this
is
really
the
brawn
of
our
brief.
we
realize
it
is
a
difficult
burden
to
carry,
if
we
have
to
get
that
far.
we
have
urged
to
this
court
as
we
did
in
the
court
below
that
even
if
your
honors
determined
not
to
reexamine
the
rodrigue
decision,
that
it
is
inequitable
in
this
situation.
although,
the
record
will
not
support
overt
reliance
on
snipes
and
ousley
and
the
pre
rodrigue
decisions,
but
if
it
is
manifestly
unfair
to
apply
this
rodrigue
decision
retroactively
in
this
particular
case
at
the
time
this
action
was
filed,
the
law
under
which
we
operated
and
had
been
operating
for
almost
a
decade
in
the
fifth
circuit,
was
that
laches
apply,
not
prescription.
there
was
no
compulsion
of
law
either
statutory
or
case
law.
it
was
all
to
the
contrary.
mr.
samuel
c.
gainsburgh
except
the
statutory
language,
which
the
fifth
circuit
had
interpreted
as
intending
to
apply
maritime
law
to
these
platforms.
of
course
as
your
honor
knows
that
fifth
circuit
in
the
snipes
case
interpreted
the
same
statute
which
was
later
interpreted
by
this
honorable
court
in
rodrigue.
they
just
came
to
different
conclusions,
but
the
litigants
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
i
assume
elsewhere,
certainly
would
have
a
right,
they
should
have
a
right
to
rely
upon
the
pronouncements
of
that
court,
not
once
but
in
at
least
four
different
cases,
three
of
which
i
think
were
denied
cert
by
this
honorable
court.
we
feel
that
this
not
the
only
matter
of
its
kind
in
the
fifth
circuit.
my
brother,
mr.
melancon
referred
to
some,
before
coming
here.
i
will
ascertain
that
there
are
actually
three
matters
pending
in
the
fifth
circuit
in
which
the
decision
is
being
withheld,
dealing
solely
with
cases
filed
before
rodrigue
after
the
state
prescription,
dismissed
by
the
district
court
after
rodrigue
was
decided
and
now
on
appeal
to
the
fifth
circuit.
perhaps,
there
are
others
in
the
district
court
which
have
not
yet
reached
that
level
that
i
am
unable
to
canvass
without
a
great
deal
of
research,
but
those
three
do
exist
along
with
mr.
huson.
these
people
will
retroactively
lose
their
causes
of
action.
it
may
be
said
by
my
brother
that
they
never
had
it
in
the
beginning
so
they
cannot
lose
what
they
never
had.
but
this
is
a
retroactive
application
of
a
time
limitation
of
which
there
was
no
fair
warning
or
reason
given
in
view
of
snipes
and
ousley
and
the
other
cases
that
were
decided.
we
feel
that
in
summary
and
in
conclusion
that
the
language,
the
literal
verbiage
of
the
lands
act
does
not
compel
this
court
to
hold
that
that
congress
intended
to
take
out
of
maritime
jurisdiction
of
what
we
contend
was
a
part
of
the
general
maritime
law
of
the
united
states.
torts
occurring
on
the
high
seas
80,
some
80-90
or
125
miles
at
sea,
it
seems
to
us
are
certainly
fitting
subjects
for
admiralty
and
maritime
jurisdiction
traditionally
and
if
not
traditionally,
certainly
modernly
and
contemporaneously
as
our
aircraft
disasters
which
seem
to
have
the
blessing
of
admiralty
law.
thank
you,
sir.
