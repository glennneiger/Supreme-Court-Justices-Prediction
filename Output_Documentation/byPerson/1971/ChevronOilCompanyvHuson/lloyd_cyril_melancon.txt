mr.
lloyd
cyril
melancon
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
matter
comes
before
you
today
in
a
writ
of
certiorari
directed
to
the
fifth
circuit
in
connection
with
its
having
reversed
a
summary
judgment
granted
to
petitioner
who
was
the
defendant
in
the
district
court
below.
the
summary
judgment
came
about
as
a
result
of
a
petition
being
filed
by
plaintiff
wherein
he
alleged
himself
to
be
a
special
service
employee
of
an
independent
contractor,
otis
engineering
company,
doing
work
on
as
he
alleged
a
fixed
and
immobile
drilling
rig
off
the
coast
of
louisiana.
he
alleged
in
his
complaint
that
the
accident
occurred
december
17,
1965
and
the
complaint
in
connection
with
that
alleged
accident
was
filled
with
the
clerk
on
january
4,
1968.
in
the
complaint,
the
plaintiff
sought
relief
in
the
basic
tort
action
alleging
recovery
under
the
longshoreman
and
harbor
workers’
compensation
act,
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
and
otherwise.
routine
discovery
transpired
and
ultimately
it
was
conclusively
shown
that
this
was
a
fixed
and
immobile
structure,
an
artificial
island
in
which
this
alleged
accident
was
supposed
to
have
occurred
and
as
result
of
that,
petitioner
filed
his
motion
for
summary
judgment.
it
was
argued
before
the
court
and
the
district
judge
in
furtherance
of
the
recent
opinion
by
this
court
in
rodrigue
held
as
a
matter
of
law
that
chevron
was
entitled
to
its
judgment
because
the
application
of
the
laws
of
louisiana
to
this
tort
action
were
that
the
plaintiff
was
compelled
to
file
a
suit
within
a
one
year
period
of
time
and
not
having
done
so,
the
matter
had
prescribed
on
time
barred
as
in
the
other
states
we
use
the
time
of
prescription.
an
appeal
was
sought
by
respondent
to
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
fifth
circuit
in
deciding
the
case,
notwithstanding
the
very
positive
position
taken
by
this
court
in
rodrigue
that
the
admiralty
and
maritime
law
did
not
apply
to
fixed
and
immobile
structures.
the
fifth
circuit
went
on
to
follow
its
earlier
decision
in
this
pure
oil
versus
snipes
case
and
held
that,
yes,
admiralty
and
maritime
law
did
apply
and
since
it
did
apply
then
the
admiralty
and
maritime
doctrine
of
laches
was
applicable
and
summarily
reversed
the
district
court.
mr.
lloyd
cyril
melancon
we
did
not,
your
honor.
the
question
of
laches
was
never
presented
to
the
district
court.
the
sole
question
presented
to
the
district
court
below
was
the
application
of
the
strict
civil
law
doctrine
of
prescription,
that
is
the
application
of
the
louisiana
law
to
plaintiff's
alleged
accident.
there
was
no
--
mr.
lloyd
cyril
melancon
one
year.
mr.
lloyd
cyril
melancon
it
was
the
same
as
the
longshoreman
and
harbor
workers’
compensation
act
which
is
one
year.
the
state
of
louisiana
compensation
act,
regular
state
act
is
one
year
and
of
course
the
historical
tort
limitation
of
louisiana
has
been
one
year
going
back
to
the
civil
code
so
that
we
do
not
have
anything
here
that
was
new
or
different.
all
that
rodrigue
said
was
that
this
court
was
satisfied
that
congress
in
having
passed
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
was
paramountly
interested
and
the
men
themselves
being
closely
connected
to
the
adjacent
states
in
which
they
were
working
and
this
court
recognized
that
congress
held
the
admiralty
and
maritime
law
doctrine
of
laches
otherwise
would
not
apply
to
fixed
and
artificial
island
such
as
this.
mr.
lloyd
cyril
melancon
that
is
right.
this
is
a
pure
action
brought
by
plaintiff
where
we
have
a
diversity
situation,
where
if
the
accident
happened
for
argument,
now
we
contend
of
course
that
this
accident
happened
in
the
territorial
waters
in
louisiana,
which
is
an
area
under
dispute
at
this
present
time
where
the
court
has
appointed
a
master
to
make
recommendations
with
respect
to
that
coastline
of
louisiana,
but
--
mr.
lloyd
cyril
melancon
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lloyd
cyril
melancon
well,
there
is
diversity
between
the
parties.
mr.
lloyd
cyril
melancon
yes,
because
they
sued
under
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
and
the
--
mr.
lloyd
cyril
melancon
tried
in
louisiana
court,
in
the
federal
court
in
louisiana.
mr.
lloyd
cyril
melancon
that
is
right.
and
the
fifth
circuit
went
on
in
its
decision
in
huson
below
to
take
a
distinction
between
substantive
and
procedural
law
and,
of
course,
with
the
background
of
the
pure
oil
versus
snipes
case
where
of
course
it
was
very
contrary
holding
to
this
court's
holding
in
rodrigue
justified
the
exception
here
and
you
had
a
real
hideous
so
to
speak
because
here
in
huson
we
have
a
personal
injury,
the
man
was
not
killed.
in
rodrigue,
doupree,
the
companion
case
is
you
have
death
cases.
now,
this
court
says
in
a
death
situation,
the
laws
of
louisiana
apply,
therefore,
the
survivors
have
one
year
within
which
to
file
their
claim.
look
at
the
situation
you
have
now,
if
the
fifth
circuit
is
to
be
maintained
in
its
contrary
opinion.
if
a
man
is
injured
offshore
and
he
lingers
more
than
12
months
and
then
subsequently
dies
without
having
filed
the
claim
or
his
survivors,
he
is
barred
under
rodrigue,
yet,
in
a
personal
injury
action
if
this
court
maintains
the
fifth
circuit,
the
individual
who
lives
may
file
this
lawsuit
at
anytime
in
the
distant
future
as
long
as
he
can
show
that
there
is
excusable
neglect
on
his
part
and
that
the
defendant
was
not
prejudiced
by
his
delays.
it
is
a
totally
inconsistent
position
your
honor
and
the
bar
in
louisiana
where
the
greatest
number
of
this
cases
are
pending
and
have
been
tried,
having
been
looking
to
this
court
for
some
resolution
of
this
problem
that
has
arisen
in
the
outer
continental
shelf.
we
thought
that
had
been
reached
in
rodrigue
where
this
court
specifically
stated
under
no
unequivocal
terms,
otherwise,
it
said
admiralty
law
does
not
apply.
the
laws
of
louisiana
shall
apply
and
those
laws
are
as
follows.
now,
i
might
mention
to
the
court
in
this
connection
that
since
the
decision
of
rodrigue
and
the
huson
decision,
the
district
court
in
baton
rouge
which
is
also
in
the
eastern
district
louisiana
in
the
guillory
case
wrote
a
very
scholarly
opinion
holding
quite
squarely
on
this
question
of
prescription
that
the
one
you
applied
that
this
is
what
the
supreme
court
said
in
rodrigue
and
just
last
month
in
fact
with
in
the
last
three
weeks
another
panel
of
the
fifth
circuit
headed
by
justices
tuttle,
wisdom
and
ingram
in
the
dickerson
case
have
specifically
held
following
this
court
in
rodrigue
that
the
laws
of
louisiana
shall
apply
to
these
accidents
occurring
on
fixed
structures
and
then
narrowly
went
on
to
apply
the
law
but
they
held
multiple
faces
of
the
louisiana
law
to
apply
such
as
the
question
proximate
cause,
the
calculation
of
damage,
the
application
of
contributory
negligence,
all
of
these
faces
that
the
fifth
circuit
seemed
to
be
so
concerned
about
as
to
having
equality
and
uniformity
of
decision,
yet,
here
is
another
panel
of
the
fifth
circuit
saying
specifically
rodrigue
is
the
law,
we
recognize
it
is
the
law.
and
in
connection
--
the
question
of
prescription
was
not
raised
therein,
but
the
court
did
go
on,
judge
tuttle
went
on,
who
was
the
organ
of
the
court
in
his
opinion,
to
observe
that
while
he
was
not
taking
issue
with
the
other
panel
which
raised
this
fine
distinction
of
substantive
procedural
law
but
he
recognized
that
this
matter
was
up
before
the
supreme
court
on
writs
for
ultimate
decision.
mr.
lloyd
cyril
melancon
we
would
confess
error,
your
honor.
mr.
lloyd
cyril
melancon
no,
it
does
not.
it
is
simply
this;
in
louisiana,
the
tort
article
of
2315
is
the
article
under
which
an
offense
can
be
asserted
in
court
and
recovery
sought
in
the
tort
action.
in
2315,
the
legislature
went
on
to
state
that
where
a
death
occurs
and
this
was
with
respect
to
the
survival
of
(inaudible)
that
these
survivors
must,
within
one
year,
bring
their
action
under
2315.
however,
in
a
pure
personal
injury
case,
the
code
law
article
is
civil
code
article
of
3536
as
applicable
thereto,
and
that
is
specifically
one
year.
and
what
happened
in
the
court
below
that
is
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
fifth
circuit
went
on
to
take
as
i
said
before,
a
distinction
between
the
substantive
law
of
2315,
which
it
said
was
absolutely
corrective
etcetera
with
respect
to
a
death
action,
but
then
went
on
to
say
well
now
3536
is
procedural,
and
therefore,
being
procedural
we
are
not
going
to
apply
the
admiralty
and
maritime
law
doctrine
of
laches,
which
is
of
course
inconsistent
with
what
had
happened
in
rodrigue.
now,
going
back
to
this
question
of
applications
of
laws,
certainly
on
the
erie
versus
tompkins
where
we
have
forum
applying
the
federal
law,
the
law
outside
of
the
united
states,
assuming
that
--
outside
of
the
state
of
louisiana,
assuming
mr.
b
outside
of
louisiana,
it
must
of
course
apply
a
federal
law,
but
the
law
of
the
forum
with
respect
to
prescription
that
the
procedural
aspects
would
be
applied
and
here
it
is.
there
is
not
dispute
that
3536
limits
a
personal
injury
action
to
one
year
and
that
is
precisely
what
we
have
here.
now,
there
is
nothing
unique
or
new
about
the
fact
that
a
tort
action
must
be
brought
in
one
year
in
louisiana.
this
goes
back
for
a
hundred
years
to
the
old
code.
anyone
practicing
in
louisiana
is
well
aware
that
this
is
nothing
new
or
different
to
something
brought
along.
i
mentioned
before,
our
state
compensations
statutes,
specifically
limits
the
right
of
recovery
and
the
compensation
to
one
year.
the
longshoreman
and
harbor
workers'
act
is
very
active.
the
plaintiff
has
alleged
in
this
lawsuit
as
being
applicable
which
was
denied,
but
he
still
alleged
of
it
being
applicable,
limits
the
right
of
recovery
to
one
year.
so
therefore,
i
think
that
it
is
quite
obvious
and
clear
from
the
record
that
plaintiff
having
filed
his
suit
in
excess
of
one
year
from
the
date
that
this
occurred
that
he
has
lost
his
rights.
these
are
rights,
if
he
had
them
that
he
failed
to
say
and
they
are
time
barred
and
prescribed,
corrected
whatever
other
terminology
we
want
to
use
in
connection
with
this.
going
back
to
the
fifth
circuit's
decision,
we
say
it
is
wrong
because
it
was
unsoundly
thought
about,
where
it
held
at
that
the
district
court
was
an
admiralty
court.
the
district
court
was
not
an
admiralty
court.
the
district
court
was
not
applying
admiralty
and
maritime
law.
the
district
court
was
applying
the
law
of
louisiana
as
defined
by
this
very
court
in
the
rodrigue
decision.
it
was
thoroughly
recognized
by
congress
and
this
very
court
that
adjacent
states
to
these
tied
lands
of
the
coastal
waters
have
a
vital
interest
in
the
men
who
worked
offshore,
who
they
must
of
course
take
care
of
any
instances
that
arise
and
this
was
thoroughly
recognized
by
congress
in
all
of
the
hearings
that
were
held
and
the
discussions
of
different
congressmen
that
were
involved.
we
then
say
that
if
that
is
true,
little
more
can
be
said
in
this
case
because
everything
had
been
said
in
rodrigue
which
is
applicable
to
our
situation
here.
the
only
basic
distinction
that
you
can
find
if
that
be
a
distinction
is
the
simple
fact
that
in
rodrigue
there
were
death
and
in
huson
it
was
a
personal
injury.
otherwise,
the
factual
situation
is
identical;
fixed
structures
and
the
relationship
of
the
parties
and
the
precedent.
unless
the
court
has
some
questions
that
they
would
ask
of
counsel,
i
would
just
like
to
keep
a
short
time
for
rebuttal
to
answer
my
brother
in
this
instance,
but
i
think
this
is
as
clear
as
any
case
as
can
be.
if
rodrigue
is
not
the
law
then
we
have
to
go
back
all
over
this
situation
and
find
out
what
it
is
because
you
got
a
lot
of
litigants,
you
got
a
lot
of
lawyers
in
louisiana
who
do
not
know
what
the
law
is.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
lloyd
cyril
melancon
there
is
a
serious
issue,
mr.
justice
brennan,
in
connection
with
the
plaintiff’s
accident
and
the
delays
that
involved
that
had
not
been
presented,
but
simply
to
touch
on
them
very
briefly,
the
record
does
establish
and
show
in
the
appendix
that
there
is
a
serious
dispute
as
to
whether
this
man
ever
had
an
accident
on
the
date
alleged
because
his
superior
contends
that
they
were
working
at
long
view,
texas
on
this
date
and
he
knows
that
no
accident
happened.
that
is
in
the
record,
but
--
mr.
lloyd
cyril
melancon
no,
that
is
right,
but
just
to
clarify
that
point
mr.
justice
brennan
raised.
secondly,
if
we
ought
to
have
the
quality
and
uniformity
as
this
court
recognized
in
rodrigue,
this
is
the
function
of
congress.
congress
can
pass
the
laws
and
make
these
man
seaman
if
they
wish,
make
submersible
rigs
vessels,
make
fixed
structures
vessels
and
otherwise
and
clearly
define
the
prescriptive
periods
which
even
under
huson,
the
theory
that
was
advanced
by
the
court
of
appeals,
you
have
no
uniformity.
you
have
mississippi,
you
have
texas,
you
have
louisiana;
each
had
different
prescriptive
periods.
now,
what
do
you
apply?
so,
the
function
here
is
the
function
of
congress.
i
do
not
believe
in
fairness
that
it
is
the
function
of
this
court.
once
it
has
fairly
and
clearly
recognized
congress'
intent
in
rodrigue
to
now
come
and
say,
but
wait
death
actions,
yes,
rodrigue
applies
bar.
personal
injuries,
no.
that
is
procedural,
and
therefore,
admiralty
and
maritime
law
applies.
(inaudible)
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
lloyd
cyril
melancon
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
matter
comes
before
you
today
in
a
writ
of
certiorari
directed
to
the
fifth
circuit
in
connection
with
its
having
reversed
a
summary
judgment
granted
to
petitioner
who
was
the
defendant
in
the
district
court
below.
the
summary
judgment
came
about
as
a
result
of
a
petition
being
filed
by
plaintiff
wherein
he
alleged
himself
to
be
a
special
service
employee
of
an
independent
contractor,
otis
engineering
company,
doing
work
on
as
he
alleged
a
fixed
and
immobile
drilling
rig
off
the
coast
of
louisiana.
he
alleged
in
his
complaint
that
the
accident
occurred
december
17,
1965
and
the
complaint
in
connection
with
that
alleged
accident
was
filled
with
the
clerk
on
january
4,
1968.
in
the
complaint,
the
plaintiff
sought
relief
in
the
basic
tort
action
alleging
recovery
under
the
longshoreman
and
harbor
workers’
compensation
act,
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
and
otherwise.
routine
discovery
transpired
and
ultimately
it
was
conclusively
shown
that
this
was
a
fixed
and
immobile
structure,
an
artificial
island
in
which
this
alleged
accident
was
supposed
to
have
occurred
and
as
result
of
that,
petitioner
filed
his
motion
for
summary
judgment.
it
was
argued
before
the
court
and
the
district
judge
in
furtherance
of
the
recent
opinion
by
this
court
in
rodrigue
held
as
a
matter
of
law
that
chevron
was
entitled
to
its
judgment
because
the
application
of
the
laws
of
louisiana
to
this
tort
action
were
that
the
plaintiff
was
compelled
to
file
a
suit
within
a
one
year
period
of
time
and
not
having
done
so,
the
matter
had
prescribed
on
time
barred
as
in
the
other
states
we
use
the
time
of
prescription.
an
appeal
was
sought
by
respondent
to
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
fifth
circuit
in
deciding
the
case,
notwithstanding
the
very
positive
position
taken
by
this
court
in
rodrigue
that
the
admiralty
and
maritime
law
did
not
apply
to
fixed
and
immobile
structures.
the
fifth
circuit
went
on
to
follow
its
earlier
decision
in
this
pure
oil
versus
snipes
case
and
held
that,
yes,
admiralty
and
maritime
law
did
apply
and
since
it
did
apply
then
the
admiralty
and
maritime
doctrine
of
laches
was
applicable
and
summarily
reversed
the
district
court.
mr.
lloyd
cyril
melancon
we
did
not,
your
honor.
the
question
of
laches
was
never
presented
to
the
district
court.
the
sole
question
presented
to
the
district
court
below
was
the
application
of
the
strict
civil
law
doctrine
of
prescription,
that
is
the
application
of
the
louisiana
law
to
plaintiff's
alleged
accident.
there
was
no
--
mr.
lloyd
cyril
melancon
one
year.
mr.
lloyd
cyril
melancon
it
was
the
same
as
the
longshoreman
and
harbor
workers’
compensation
act
which
is
one
year.
the
state
of
louisiana
compensation
act,
regular
state
act
is
one
year
and
of
course
the
historical
tort
limitation
of
louisiana
has
been
one
year
going
back
to
the
civil
code
so
that
we
do
not
have
anything
here
that
was
new
or
different.
all
that
rodrigue
said
was
that
this
court
was
satisfied
that
congress
in
having
passed
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
was
paramountly
interested
and
the
men
themselves
being
closely
connected
to
the
adjacent
states
in
which
they
were
working
and
this
court
recognized
that
congress
held
the
admiralty
and
maritime
law
doctrine
of
laches
otherwise
would
not
apply
to
fixed
and
artificial
island
such
as
this.
mr.
lloyd
cyril
melancon
that
is
right.
this
is
a
pure
action
brought
by
plaintiff
where
we
have
a
diversity
situation,
where
if
the
accident
happened
for
argument,
now
we
contend
of
course
that
this
accident
happened
in
the
territorial
waters
in
louisiana,
which
is
an
area
under
dispute
at
this
present
time
where
the
court
has
appointed
a
master
to
make
recommendations
with
respect
to
that
coastline
of
louisiana,
but
--
mr.
lloyd
cyril
melancon
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lloyd
cyril
melancon
well,
there
is
diversity
between
the
parties.
mr.
lloyd
cyril
melancon
yes,
because
they
sued
under
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
and
the
--
mr.
lloyd
cyril
melancon
tried
in
louisiana
court,
in
the
federal
court
in
louisiana.
mr.
lloyd
cyril
melancon
that
is
right.
and
the
fifth
circuit
went
on
in
its
decision
in
huson
below
to
take
a
distinction
between
substantive
and
procedural
law
and,
of
course,
with
the
background
of
the
pure
oil
versus
snipes
case
where
of
course
it
was
very
contrary
holding
to
this
court's
holding
in
rodrigue
justified
the
exception
here
and
you
had
a
real
hideous
so
to
speak
because
here
in
huson
we
have
a
personal
injury,
the
man
was
not
killed.
in
rodrigue,
doupree,
the
companion
case
is
you
have
death
cases.
now,
this
court
says
in
a
death
situation,
the
laws
of
louisiana
apply,
therefore,
the
survivors
have
one
year
within
which
to
file
their
claim.
look
at
the
situation
you
have
now,
if
the
fifth
circuit
is
to
be
maintained
in
its
contrary
opinion.
if
a
man
is
injured
offshore
and
he
lingers
more
than
12
months
and
then
subsequently
dies
without
having
filed
the
claim
or
his
survivors,
he
is
barred
under
rodrigue,
yet,
in
a
personal
injury
action
if
this
court
maintains
the
fifth
circuit,
the
individual
who
lives
may
file
this
lawsuit
at
anytime
in
the
distant
future
as
long
as
he
can
show
that
there
is
excusable
neglect
on
his
part
and
that
the
defendant
was
not
prejudiced
by
his
delays.
it
is
a
totally
inconsistent
position
your
honor
and
the
bar
in
louisiana
where
the
greatest
number
of
this
cases
are
pending
and
have
been
tried,
having
been
looking
to
this
court
for
some
resolution
of
this
problem
that
has
arisen
in
the
outer
continental
shelf.
we
thought
that
had
been
reached
in
rodrigue
where
this
court
specifically
stated
under
no
unequivocal
terms,
otherwise,
it
said
admiralty
law
does
not
apply.
the
laws
of
louisiana
shall
apply
and
those
laws
are
as
follows.
now,
i
might
mention
to
the
court
in
this
connection
that
since
the
decision
of
rodrigue
and
the
huson
decision,
the
district
court
in
baton
rouge
which
is
also
in
the
eastern
district
louisiana
in
the
guillory
case
wrote
a
very
scholarly
opinion
holding
quite
squarely
on
this
question
of
prescription
that
the
one
you
applied
that
this
is
what
the
supreme
court
said
in
rodrigue
and
just
last
month
in
fact
with
in
the
last
three
weeks
another
panel
of
the
fifth
circuit
headed
by
justices
tuttle,
wisdom
and
ingram
in
the
dickerson
case
have
specifically
held
following
this
court
in
rodrigue
that
the
laws
of
louisiana
shall
apply
to
these
accidents
occurring
on
fixed
structures
and
then
narrowly
went
on
to
apply
the
law
but
they
held
multiple
faces
of
the
louisiana
law
to
apply
such
as
the
question
proximate
cause,
the
calculation
of
damage,
the
application
of
contributory
negligence,
all
of
these
faces
that
the
fifth
circuit
seemed
to
be
so
concerned
about
as
to
having
equality
and
uniformity
of
decision,
yet,
here
is
another
panel
of
the
fifth
circuit
saying
specifically
rodrigue
is
the
law,
we
recognize
it
is
the
law.
and
in
connection
--
the
question
of
prescription
was
not
raised
therein,
but
the
court
did
go
on,
judge
tuttle
went
on,
who
was
the
organ
of
the
court
in
his
opinion,
to
observe
that
while
he
was
not
taking
issue
with
the
other
panel
which
raised
this
fine
distinction
of
substantive
procedural
law
but
he
recognized
that
this
matter
was
up
before
the
supreme
court
on
writs
for
ultimate
decision.
mr.
lloyd
cyril
melancon
we
would
confess
error,
your
honor.
mr.
lloyd
cyril
melancon
no,
it
does
not.
it
is
simply
this;
in
louisiana,
the
tort
article
of
2315
is
the
article
under
which
an
offense
can
be
asserted
in
court
and
recovery
sought
in
the
tort
action.
in
2315,
the
legislature
went
on
to
state
that
where
a
death
occurs
and
this
was
with
respect
to
the
survival
of
(inaudible)
that
these
survivors
must,
within
one
year,
bring
their
action
under
2315.
however,
in
a
pure
personal
injury
case,
the
code
law
article
is
civil
code
article
of
3536
as
applicable
thereto,
and
that
is
specifically
one
year.
and
what
happened
in
the
court
below
that
is
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
fifth
circuit
went
on
to
take
as
i
said
before,
a
distinction
between
the
substantive
law
of
2315,
which
it
said
was
absolutely
corrective
etcetera
with
respect
to
a
death
action,
but
then
went
on
to
say
well
now
3536
is
procedural,
and
therefore,
being
procedural
we
are
not
going
to
apply
the
admiralty
and
maritime
law
doctrine
of
laches,
which
is
of
course
inconsistent
with
what
had
happened
in
rodrigue.
now,
going
back
to
this
question
of
applications
of
laws,
certainly
on
the
erie
versus
tompkins
where
we
have
forum
applying
the
federal
law,
the
law
outside
of
the
united
states,
assuming
that
--
outside
of
the
state
of
louisiana,
assuming
mr.
b
outside
of
louisiana,
it
must
of
course
apply
a
federal
law,
but
the
law
of
the
forum
with
respect
to
prescription
that
the
procedural
aspects
would
be
applied
and
here
it
is.
there
is
not
dispute
that
3536
limits
a
personal
injury
action
to
one
year
and
that
is
precisely
what
we
have
here.
now,
there
is
nothing
unique
or
new
about
the
fact
that
a
tort
action
must
be
brought
in
one
year
in
louisiana.
this
goes
back
for
a
hundred
years
to
the
old
code.
anyone
practicing
in
louisiana
is
well
aware
that
this
is
nothing
new
or
different
to
something
brought
along.
i
mentioned
before,
our
state
compensations
statutes,
specifically
limits
the
right
of
recovery
and
the
compensation
to
one
year.
the
longshoreman
and
harbor
workers'
act
is
very
active.
the
plaintiff
has
alleged
in
this
lawsuit
as
being
applicable
which
was
denied,
but
he
still
alleged
of
it
being
applicable,
limits
the
right
of
recovery
to
one
year.
so
therefore,
i
think
that
it
is
quite
obvious
and
clear
from
the
record
that
plaintiff
having
filed
his
suit
in
excess
of
one
year
from
the
date
that
this
occurred
that
he
has
lost
his
rights.
these
are
rights,
if
he
had
them
that
he
failed
to
say
and
they
are
time
barred
and
prescribed,
corrected
whatever
other
terminology
we
want
to
use
in
connection
with
this.
going
back
to
the
fifth
circuit's
decision,
we
say
it
is
wrong
because
it
was
unsoundly
thought
about,
where
it
held
at
that
the
district
court
was
an
admiralty
court.
the
district
court
was
not
an
admiralty
court.
the
district
court
was
not
applying
admiralty
and
maritime
law.
the
district
court
was
applying
the
law
of
louisiana
as
defined
by
this
very
court
in
the
rodrigue
decision.
it
was
thoroughly
recognized
by
congress
and
this
very
court
that
adjacent
states
to
these
tied
lands
of
the
coastal
waters
have
a
vital
interest
in
the
men
who
worked
offshore,
who
they
must
of
course
take
care
of
any
instances
that
arise
and
this
was
thoroughly
recognized
by
congress
in
all
of
the
hearings
that
were
held
and
the
discussions
of
different
congressmen
that
were
involved.
we
then
say
that
if
that
is
true,
little
more
can
be
said
in
this
case
because
everything
had
been
said
in
rodrigue
which
is
applicable
to
our
situation
here.
the
only
basic
distinction
that
you
can
find
if
that
be
a
distinction
is
the
simple
fact
that
in
rodrigue
there
were
death
and
in
huson
it
was
a
personal
injury.
otherwise,
the
factual
situation
is
identical;
fixed
structures
and
the
relationship
of
the
parties
and
the
precedent.
unless
the
court
has
some
questions
that
they
would
ask
of
counsel,
i
would
just
like
to
keep
a
short
time
for
rebuttal
to
answer
my
brother
in
this
instance,
but
i
think
this
is
as
clear
as
any
case
as
can
be.
if
rodrigue
is
not
the
law
then
we
have
to
go
back
all
over
this
situation
and
find
out
what
it
is
because
you
got
a
lot
of
litigants,
you
got
a
lot
of
lawyers
in
louisiana
who
do
not
know
what
the
law
is.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
lloyd
cyril
melancon
there
is
a
serious
issue,
mr.
justice
brennan,
in
connection
with
the
plaintiff’s
accident
and
the
delays
that
involved
that
had
not
been
presented,
but
simply
to
touch
on
them
very
briefly,
the
record
does
establish
and
show
in
the
appendix
that
there
is
a
serious
dispute
as
to
whether
this
man
ever
had
an
accident
on
the
date
alleged
because
his
superior
contends
that
they
were
working
at
long
view,
texas
on
this
date
and
he
knows
that
no
accident
happened.
that
is
in
the
record,
but
--
mr.
lloyd
cyril
melancon
no,
that
is
right,
but
just
to
clarify
that
point
mr.
justice
brennan
raised.
secondly,
if
we
ought
to
have
the
quality
and
uniformity
as
this
court
recognized
in
rodrigue,
this
is
the
function
of
congress.
congress
can
pass
the
laws
and
make
these
man
seaman
if
they
wish,
make
submersible
rigs
vessels,
make
fixed
structures
vessels
and
otherwise
and
clearly
define
the
prescriptive
periods
which
even
under
huson,
the
theory
that
was
advanced
by
the
court
of
appeals,
you
have
no
uniformity.
you
have
mississippi,
you
have
texas,
you
have
louisiana;
each
had
different
prescriptive
periods.
now,
what
do
you
apply?
so,
the
function
here
is
the
function
of
congress.
i
do
not
believe
in
fairness
that
it
is
the
function
of
this
court.
once
it
has
fairly
and
clearly
recognized
congress'
intent
in
rodrigue
to
now
come
and
say,
but
wait
death
actions,
yes,
rodrigue
applies
bar.
personal
injuries,
no.
that
is
procedural,
and
therefore,
admiralty
and
maritime
law
applies.
(inaudible)
thank
you,
your
honor.
