this
thing,
(inaudible)
the
district
court’s
jurisdiction
is
invoked
as
a
federal
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
the
diversity?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
it
is,
but
that
is
a
really
federal
question
(voice
overlap)
under
the
land
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
federal
covered
that,
governed
by
federal
law?
justice
byron

white
and
they
have
--
even
if
you
bar
a
state
law
as
rodrigue
or
the
statute
says,
it
is
still
federal
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
all
together
that
rodrigue
be
considered?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
also
claim
that
rodrigue
is
inconsistent
with
the
lands
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
say,
though
you
are
really
saying
that
the
admiralty
law,
if
you
really
treated,
particularly
dealing
with
platform,
vessels
and
people
working
on
them
as
a
seaman
and
at
least
have
the
admiralty
law
available
to
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice

as
i
understand
you
say
the
admiralty
law
did
apply
not
the
law
of
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
do
with
the
language?
i
don’t
think
this
is
a
re-argument
of
rodrigue?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
either
win
or
lose?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
what
do
you
do?
so,
accepting
on
that
basis,
what
do
you
do
with
the
language
of
the
act
and
legislature
history
of
the
congress
clearly
says
that
a

can
be
