mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
perfectly
grateful
sir.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
first
if
i
may
to
what
i
believe
is
a
misconception
on
the
part
of
the
solicitor
--mr.
solicitor
general
as
respect
the
factual
background
of
this
case
which
was
before
judge
hart
at
the
time
he
decided
the
issue
which
brings
the
case
here.
at
page
12
of
the
appendix,
there
appears
colloquy
between
counsel
and
the
court
and
i
am
quoting
from
my
own
remarks
to
judge
hart,
if
the
court
please.
i
made
the
statement
at
the
foot
of
page
12
and
at
the
top
of
page
13.
now,
in
this
regard
the
papers
which
have
been
filed
in
the
case
and
the
data
which
had
been
supplied
as
respects
to
the
claims
made
against
the
defendant
brewster
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
what
is
being
attacked
by
this
indictment
are
senator
brewster’s
votes
in
committee
and
his
votes
on
the
floor
and
his
activities
in
connection
with
what
the
supreme
court
has
described
as
things
generally
done
in
a
session
of
the
house
by
its
members.
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
who
was
arguing
the
case
came
back
to
this
point
at
page
28
of
the
appendix,
in
colloquy
again
with
judge
hart.
judge
hart
and
i
am
spiking
into
the
middle
of
a
court’s
question
at
about
midway
down,
page
28
of
the
appendix,
if
the
court
please.
“well,
tell
me
this?
does
the
indictment
in
any
ways
allege
that
brewster
did
anything
not
related
to
his
purely
legislative
functions.
mr.
barret:
we
are
not
contending
that
what
is
being
charged
here,
that
is
the
activity
by
brewster,
was
anything
other
than
a
legislative
act.
we
are
not
ducking
the
question.
it
is
squarely
presented.
they
are
legislative
acts.
we
are
not
going
to
quibble
over
that.”
now
this
is
against
the
background
if
the
court
please
of
there
having
been
supplied
on
a
confidential
basis
to
the
court,
a
memorandum
or
fact
which
replaced
a
statement
in
connection
with
a
motion
for
particulars
which
outlines
the
very
acts
which
were
addressed
to
the
particular
counts
and
what
the
assistant
was
telling
judge
hart
was,
your
honor,
we
do
not
contend
their
were
any
activities,
not
legislative
in
nature
and
that
is
fully
supportive
in
the
record,
in
this
case.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
that
is
correct,
and
we
would
say
--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
it
is
--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
it
is
--
it
is
a
confidential
memorandum
in
the
record.
i
simply
put
in
context
justice
brennan.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
would
say
mr.
justice
that
our
approach
that
is
that
the
assistant
did
make
a
concession
of
fact.
that
is
to
say
that
it
was
a
stipulation
which
was
made
by
the
assistant
as
respect
to
what
the
facts
of
the
case
were,
put
before
the
district
judge
and
the
district
judge
was
entitled
to
rely
upon
that
as
negating
the
need
for
additional
proof
in
this
particular
record,
although
the
confidential
memo
does
exist
in
the
records
of
the
district
court.
but
he
need
--
he
saw
no
need
to
an
effect
say,
we
will
put
on
the
record
the
full
confidential
memorandum
which
has
been
heretofore
filed
and
obviously
what
was
--
this
concern
of
counsel
and
the
court
at
that
point
in
time,
that
this
case
was
approaching
trial.
we
were
in
the
antecedent
stage
of
coming
to
trial
and
there
was
plenty
of
publicity
as
it
was.
there
was
no
need
to
have
further
newspaper
publicity
over
what
might
be
called
the
detailed
particulars
of
the
count,
but
judge
hart
did
not
need
to
put
it
on
the
record
where
the
assistant
said
flatly,
on
behalf
of
united
states
--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
mr.
justice,
the
approach
was
that
the
government
supplied
a
memorandum
of
alleged
--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
well,
all
i
--
the
only
answer
i
give
to
that
mr.
justice
marshall
is
--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
that
is
the
essence
of
the
memorandum,
but
nothing
except
legislative
acts
are
concerned,
sir.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
he
did
not
mention
the
memorandum,
yes
sir.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
no,
your
honor,
i
must
disagree
with
that.
what
he
was
saying
was
what
record
in
fact
disclosed,
that
is
to
say
--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
the
record
which
the
assistant
knew
about,
the
court
knew
about.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
the
record
in
the
case
before
judge
hart
sir.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
it
is
not,
except
in
the
form
of
the
concession
by
the
assistant.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
yes
mr.
justice
and
it
was
on
that
basis
that
i
was
trying
to
put
in
context
all
that
was
said
before
the
court
was
that
the
court
was
relying
on
facts
which
he
knew
to
be
concessions
in
the
record
by
united
states
openly
conceded
by
the
assistant
that
he
was
testing
legislative
acts
pure
and
simple.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
that
is
precisely
the
way
in
which
the
particulars
--
the
particulars
simply
addressed
themselves
to
the
allegation
of
the
indictment
which
was,
that
it
was
official
action
that
is
to
say
legislative
action
and
that
is
precisely
what
it
did.
on
the
given
day
at
a
given
time
in
a
given
committee
hearing,
in
a
given
both
on
the
floor
there
was
a
certain
step
taken
by
the
senator
which
is
alleged
to
show
that
his
action,
vote
and
decision
was
inferentially
at
least
premised
upon
antecedent
conduct
for
relations
with
spiegel
and/or
anderson.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
that
so
far
as
the
jurisdiction
and
so
far
as
the
constitutional
point
are
concerned
it
cannot
be
--
it
cannot
be
addressed
purely
on
the
basis
of
the
structure
of
the
indictment.
i
believe
however
in
fairness
to
the
court
that
all
of
these
items
which
appear
throughout
this
record
in
which
the
solicitor
general
had
not
caught
the
copy
items
in
that
context,
do
clearly
indicate
that
the
government
never
contended
it
was
anything
but
legislative
action
which
was
under
attack
here.
therefore
we
are
not
up
against
the
miasma
of
claims
that
he
may
have
acted
with
the
executive
for
example,
in
the
burton
type
situation
where
a
u.s.
senator
or
the
johnson
type
is
substantive
counts
where
a
congressman
works
into
the
executive
side
of
the
government
and
may
indeed
be
subjected
to
criminal
prosecution
as
was
congressman
johnson
in
connection
with
his
activities
before
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
in
the
executive
side.
now,
this
is
the
provision
which
we
have
taken
right
along
that
is
to
say
that,
basically
you
may
approach
the
entirety
of
the
problem
plus
the
constitutional
matter
and
of
the
jurisdictional
matter
on
the
basis
of
the
indictment
before
the
court
and
our
motion
to
dismiss
because
we
view
our
motion
to
dismiss,
if
the
court
please
in
this
posture,
under
the
earlier
teachings
of
the
court
in
cases
which
have
dealt
with
the
speech
or
debate
clause
that
is,
that
has
become
before
this
court,
it
has
taken
on
a
significance
which
is
to
the
effect
that
not
only
does
the
clause
give
protection
to
the
accused
senator
or
congressman
from
the
accusation
itself,
but
freeze
him
indeed
from
the
obligation
to
defend
himself.
this
of
course,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
will
recall
within
that
aspect
of
the
powell
case
in
the
lower
court
opinion,
the
circuit
court
opinion
written
while
you
were
on
the
bench
here
in
dc
and
it
also
was
the
teaching
of
the
dombrowski
case
and
ultimately
of
the
powell
case
before
this
court
when
it
came
up
here.
that
there
was
a
freedom
not
only
from
the
charge
itself,
but
in
addition,
it
was
intended
to
free
the
particular
public
servant
of
the
obligation
of
defending
himself
which
is
an
even
more
subtle
concept
in
the
sense
that
it
does
not
quite
come
to
the
same
form
of
immunity
that
we
normally
think
of.
it
has
stepped
in
ahead
and
what
we
had
done
by
our
motion
to
dismiss
in
this
case
was
invite
the
district
court’s
attention
to
the
operative
events
which
lead
to
our
being
in
a
position
where
we
could
say
to
the
court,
we
ought
to
be
protected
against
the
obligation
even
to
defend
ourselves
because
--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
defend
himself
from
that,
the
liability
--mr.
justice,
the
--
it
speaks
in
terms
of
being
questioned
in
any
other
place
--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
think
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
problem
we
are
up
against
there
is
whether
this
--
his
motivation
maybe
questioned,
that
is
to
say
(voice
overlap)
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
--
in
taking
--
what
is
this
money,
motive
for
accepting
the
money
is
really
what
you
are
asking
me
sir
and
to
that
extent,
you
see,
you
go
to
motivation
and
the
kilbourn
case
and
all
of
the
other
cases
have
addressed
themselves
not
only
to
acts
and
conduct,
but
anything
which
inquired
into
motive
for
the
vote.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
it
seems
to
me
that
the
speech
and
debate
clause
again.
keep
him
from
being
questioned
at
any
other
place
other
than
the
house
of
which
he
was
a
member.
we
do
not
contend
that
the
senator
or
a
congressman
go
scoot
free.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
yes,
but
in
order
to
prove
the
bribe
up
--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
that
is
correct.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
yes
your
honor,
if
i
may
address
myself
to
the
point.
mr.
justice
the
way
i
see
it,
it
is
--
the
situation
is
this.
at
the
time
he
accepted
the
money
in
order
to
prove
up
the
bribery
case,
simply
let
us
say
to
prove
that
he
undertook
to
do
a
certain
thing,
that
is
to
say
that
he
was
to
be
motivated
in
connection
with
official
conduct
otherwise
you
have
proven
no
bribes.
it
is
precisely
that
which
the
constitutional
clause
would
interdict
and
stopping
for
pariente.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
think
sir
that
constitutional
clause
has
taken
on
the
gloss
(ph)
of
the
cases
which
have
interpreted
it
all
away
down.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
it
seems
to
the
me
the
kilbourn
case
does
sir
in
connection
with
motive,
inquiry
into
motive
in
any
place
other
than
the
house
of
representatives
(voice
overlap)
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
understand
the
proposition
which
the
court
puts
to
me,
but
i
trust
it
is
not
thought
to
be
this
situation
sir,
because
this
was
alleged
to
be
for
a
vote
for
various
conduct
--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
yes
sir.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
one,
well,
initial
counts,
the
first
counts,
all
deal
with
the
pending
or
to
be
pending
before
him.
the
last
count,
sir,
does
the
201
(g),
which
has
to
do
with
past
conduct
as
distinct
from
anticipatory
conduct.
so
he
is
alleged
to
have
received
in
connection
with
his
vote
and
his
action
and
his
official
conduct
in
connection
with
either
anticipate
it
or
coming
legislation,
legislation
pending
in
the
congress
and
in
the
last
count,
with
legislation
which
had
been
in
an
earlier
context.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
no
problem.
this
is
why
i
say
it
to
the
court
that
the
concession
by
the
assistant
that
what
is
talked
about
is
to
vote
and
what
is
talked
about
is
legislative
conduct,
pure
and
simple.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
that
is
correct,
in
return
for
being
influenced
and
in
respect
to
his
action,
vote
and
decision.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
to
stay
away
and
it
stains
--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
would
sir.
i
would
think
that
in
that
instance
again
you
would
be
inquiring
into
the
motive
of
a
legislature
--
legislator
and
i
believe
sir
that
speech
or
debate
clause
would
protect
against
inquiry.
now
as
i
--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
that
is
correct
sir,
that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
but
one
has
got
--
one
is
a
necessary
quantum
of
proof
in
order
to
proof
up
the
other.
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
the
johnson
case,
mr.
justice
stewart,
you
have
got
a
number
of
aspects
to
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
one
maybe
the
exclusion
of
evidence
at
the
trial
for
example
because
if
this
case
had
gone
to
trial
and
a
testimony
had
been
elicited
or
sought
to
be
elicited
which
had
to
do
with
motive
for
his
acceptance
of
particular
money,
immediately
you
would
have
had
confronting
the
court,
the
problem
of
to
what
extent
as
an
evidentiary
matter,
assuming
that
we
do
not
meet
it
as
a
jurisdictional
matter,
this
problem
was
raised
also
in
the
powell
case,
does
speech
or
debate
address
itself
to
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
in
one
phase
of
our
brief,
we
have
suggested
that
it
is
does
in
the
sense
that
this
is
a
power,
delegated
constitutionally
to
one
branch
of
government
and
should
not
intruded
upon
by
another.
in
another
portion
of
the
brief,
we
have
suggested
that
the
congress
jointly
cannot
do
what
the
constitution
gives
to
each
of
the
houses
respectively.
the
power
to
punish
its
own
members,
so
that
there
still
is
in
the
background
of
this
problem,
the
question
of
is
it
jurisdictional.
now,
if
it
is
not
jurisdictional
and
we
do
suggest
at
one
point
that
it
maybe.
it
certainly,
under
the
johnson
case
and
i
think
under
any
rule
or
reason,
it
has
the
application
in
the
problems
of
admissibility
of
evidence
at
trial
where
you
run
into
constitutional
interdiction,
if
you
try
to
elicit
the
johnson
type
testimony,
did
you
vote,
why
you
did
you?
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
yes
sir.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
would
certainly
say,
sir,
that
both
of
those
actions
of
his
would
be
subject
to
discipline
in
his
house.
i
am
simply
addressing
myself
in
this
instance
to
saying
that
they
should
not
be
questioned
in
any
other
place,
which
is
what
the
speech
and
debate
says.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
for
improper
conduct,
no,
for
improper
conduct
in
connection
with
holding
out
that
he
would
be
willing
to
be
influenced
in
his
vote.
that
is
--
that
they
hold,
i
hopefully
a
possible
story
is
[laughter]
equality
of
bribing
both
ways
and
you
ought
to
get
a
fair
result,
but
[laughter]
the
fishing
aspect
of
it,
i
do
not
think
would
be
a
subject
to
discipline,
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
come
into
the
--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
do
sir.
the
legislative,
if
the
--
mr.
justice,
your
characterization
of
legislative
conduct,
yes
sir,
i
do.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
yes
sir,
i
do.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
it
could
take
the
form
as
it
had
in
the
past
illustrations
which
are
found
throughout
the
various
studies
of
the
congress.
it
can
--
expulsion
for
example,
suspension
from
the
house,
even
imprisonment
and
disciplined
by
fine
maybe
imposed
within
the
framework
of
the
house’s
ability
--
house
of
congress’s
ability
to
discipline
their
own
members.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
that
is
one
portion
of
our
brief,
mr.
justice
brennan,
we
address
ourself
to
that
and
suggest
that
where
the
congress
allocates
to
each
house,
that
is
not
delegated
to
the
congress
as
a
whole
for
the
purpose
of
legislating
concern,
now
i
think
sir,
we
have
eliminated
or
admitted
only
one
and
that
is
a
major
thing
to
a
politician
and
that
is
the
people
at
the
polls.
they
have
the
absolute
right
to
turn
him
out
and
this
of
course
is
one
of
the
political
realities
of
the
whole
situation
which
ultimately
must
be
faced
by
everybody
who
must
run
for
office
and
it
is
one
of
the
real
justifications
for
giving
a
political
judgment
as
respect
to
proper
punishment
to
a
political
forum
as
distinct
from
a
judicial
forum.
it
permits
the
testing
of
the
conduct
of
the
members.
as
the
solicitor
general
argues,
he
says
get
it
out
of
the
political
forum,
put
into
the
courts
where
the
dispassionate
grand
jury,
the
dispassionate
judges
may
hear
it.
we
say
on
the
other
hand
that
every
reasonable
practicality
having
to
deal
with
men
who
must
pick
up,
be
elected
to
office,
to
men
who
must
seek
campaign
contribution,
to
a
men
who
necessarily
must
confer
with,
consult
with
and
be
influenced
by
their
constituents
day
after
day,
in
order
to
avoid
an
interest
being
drawn
in
a
grand
jury
by
an
overactive
(voice
overlap).
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
believe
sir
that
you
will
find
that
this
philosophy,
that
is
to
say,
the
philosophy
of
the
right
to
a
political
philosophy
is
for
example
covered
by
mr.
kirby
in
his
study
for
the
bar
of
the
city
of
new
york
as
respect
to
matter.
it
is
covered
by
a
harvard
law
review
article
(voice
overlap)
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
do
not
believe
sir
that
i
can
falsely
represent
that
there
is
a
specific
statement
made
by
one
of
the
framers
of
the
constitution
as
respect
to
that.
but
certainly,
shortly
after
it
is
was
put
into
effect
as
a
constitutional
provision,
it
was
--
it
has
been
interpreted
in
effect
to
retain
this
right
within
the
political
body,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
you
do
have
such
the
history
here,
mr.
justice
brennan,
but
i
would
submit
that
you
also
have
coincident
with
it.
you
have
running
along
side
of
the
1853
statutes,
you
have
repeated
assertions
by
the
congress
or
the
houses
of
the
congress
of
their
right
to
seek
out
the
alleged
bribe
taker,
the
oath's
aims
type
case,
all
of
which
are
fully
discussed
in
the
historical
footnotes
in
our
brief
and
in
1873,
there
into
the
(inaudible)
scandal
in
depth
for
the
alleged
bribery
in
the
congress,
for
the
executive
not
attempting
to
use
the
1853
statute
for
any
prosecution.
you
have
the
repeated
assertion
of
congress’
right
to
fulfill
its
constitutional
obligation
to
discipline
its
own
members
sir.
now,
in
connection
with
the
1853
statute,
i
believe
sir
that
this
should
be
kept
in
mind.
certainly
the
1853
statute
was
designed
to
cover
situations
such
as
the
case,
u.s.
against
burton,
such
as
the
case
of
u.s.
versus
johnson,
where
the
whole
thrust
forward
of
the
case
was
on
the
basis
that
johnson
had
been
bought,
he
was
bribed
--
he
was
a
bribed
congressman.
that
conspiracy
element
was
admittedly
the
textual
basis
for
the
case.
but
it
was
a
claimed
bribery
and
the
government
advanced
many
of
the
same
arguments
there
that
are
advanced
here
and
they
analogized
to
and
reasoned
from
bribery
statutes,
including
the
one
which
is
before
us
now.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
justice
harlan
certainly
did
sir
and
it
is
(voice
overlap)
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
well,
i
am
not
sure
that
justice
harlan
by
reserving
it
suggested
necessarily
that
this
court
would
--
would
when
it
came
up,
still
considered
an
adequate
case.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
precisely,
and
if
you
have
not
decided
it
sir
and
i
submit
you
can
decide
yes
or
you
might
decide
no
as
the
case
maybe.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
yes
sir.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
you
are
addressing
yourself
precisely
to
the
set
of
facts
that
existed
in
oakes
ames
case
in
1873
when
the
congress
tried
to
issue
out
themselves
and
the
courts
did
not
intercede,
that
was
the
distribution
of
stock
in
connection
with
the
credit
mobilier
is
set
up
where
8,
10
or
12
that
is
spread
throughout
the
congress
as
a
practical
matter
and
up
and
down
the
line,
i
would
say
this.
it
is
seems
to
me
that
the
house
is
capable
of
handling
that
problem
on
its
own.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
constitution
commits
that
problem
to
the
house
of
which
the
man
is
a
member
and
it
seems
to
us
that
the
constitution
interdicts
the
intercession
of
the
executive,
because
the
basic
situation
as
we
see
is
this.
to
rule
or
hold
otherwise
would
give
such
powerful
control
in
the
executive
to
harass,
investigate
and
generally
badger
anybody
who
makes
a
politically
unpopular
decision
and
improper
to
the
executive,
possibly
acceptable
to
the
legislative
side
and
always
you
have
in
the
political
forum,
you
have
the
concurrence
of
a
need
to
get
elected,
the
occurrence
of
campaign
funds,
the
concurrence
of
visits
from
constituents,
the
likelihood
that
a
congressman's
votes
will
indeed
represent
him
as
a
silver
block
senator,
as
a
foreign
block
senator,
as
a
fishing
block
senator,
all
having
received
campaign
contributions
from
those
particular
elements
of
their
constituents.
once
you
have
an
affirmative
vote
and
a
contribution,
we
come
then
to
the
question
of
may
you
put
that
before
a
grand
jury
and
say
now,
we
are
not
suggesting
it
to
you,
but
you
might
certainly
draw
an
inference
that
there
is
cause
and
effect.
the
threat,
the
overpowering
threat
to
the
freedom
of
the
congressman
which
is
opposed
by
that
type
of
a
rule,
would
it
seems
to
us
go
a
long
way
to
destroy
the
basic
fabric
of
our
tripartite
form
of
government.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
he
would
in
that
instance,
it
is
seems
to
me,
fall
within
the
--
the
solicitor
general,
excuse
me
sir,
described
that
the
briber
not
to
bribee
is
the
postulate
which
you
are
putting
to
me
mr.
chief
justice
as
i
understand
it.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
what
you
certainly
have
in
that
case
is
probably
the
ability
to
get
him
his
principal
first
degree,
no
matter
which
side
of
the
coin
he
is
on,
if
he
occupies
his
official
position.
though
i
am
not
sure
that
--
i
am
not
sure
that
which
side
he
is
on
would
make
much
difference
in
my
professional
judgment
as
respect
to
possible
freedom
from
or
subjection
to
discipline
or
a
trial
as
a
result
of
his
conduct
sir.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
just
for
a
moment
if
i
may
to
one
further
aspect
of
this
point
with
respect
to
the
breadth
of
a
privilege.
i
think
it
is
perfectly
clear
and
i
think
mr.
justice
brennan’s
question
to
the
solicitor
general
makes
it
clear
and
the
concession
at
page
11
of
the
government’s
brief
that
what
is
covered
by
the
speech
or
debate
clause
or
committee
report’s
resolutions
and
the
act
of
voting
“as
or
things
generally
done
in
the
session
of
the
house
by
one
of
its
members
in
relation
to
the
business
before
it”
and
i
am
taking
that
quote
directly
out
of
this
court’s
opinion
in
the
powell
case
and
it
of
course
carries
forward
a
series
of
other
decisions
which
are
antecedent,
going
all
the
way
back
to
some
of
the
landmark
decisions
in
the
early
days,
shortly
after
the
constitution
was
adopted
and
at
a
time
when
it
may
reasonably
be
thought
that
the
judges
who
were
writing
about
it
had
reason
to
know
basically
what
was
in
the
mind
of
the
framers.
insofar
as
the
1853
act
is
concerned,
we
say
this.
very
simply,
the
1853
act
could
constitute
a
perfectly
proper
exercise
of
congressional
authority
without
coming
into
conflict
of
speech
or
debate,
if
it
is
limited
in
its
impact
to
situations
where
a
senator
may
or
did
receive
moneys
in
connection
with
executive
conduct
or
conduct
relating
to
the
judiciary,
but
not
in
connection
with
legislation.
and
it
is
there,
again,
coming
back
mr.
chief
justice
to
the
question
which
you
put
to
me
sir,
it
is
there
that
we
come
back
to
say
that
is
within
the
ambit
of
the
house
of
which
he
is
a
member,
it
is
without
the
ambit
of
the
judiciary
and
the
executive.
and
looking
at
the
1853
act
and
looking
at
the
1962
revision
of
it,
we
most
respectfully
urge
that
in
each
of
those
instances,
this
can
be
given
constitutional
validity
in
its
broad
range
to
protect
against
bribery,
but
that
the
executive
and
judiciary
should
withhold
their
hands
where
they
intrude
in
to
what
might
be
called
the
basic
defensive
mechanism
given
by
the
constitution
to
the
members
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
as
a
practical
matter,
all
of
those
you
will
recall
are
in
the
house
of
senate
proceedings
and
they
were
frequently
had
called
the
task
particularly
at
about
the
time
of
civil
war.
they
were
called
to
task
for
challenging
to
duels
where
fist
to
cuts
on
the
floors
of
the
various
houses
of
congress
and
basically
i
would
say
that
that
is
not
covered
by
speech
or
debate
or
by
this
court's
interpretation
a
speech
or
debate.
now,
again
on
the
other
side
of
that,
it
is
clearly
within
the
house's
power
to
punish
unseemly
behavior
on
the
floor
of
its
legislative
hall.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
would
think
sir,
it
would
probably
in
most
instances
fall
outside
the
scope
which
i
contend
for
the
speech
or
debate
clause
as
interpreted
by
this
court
which
--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
would
think
that
it
would
sir
because
i
think
it
would
fall
outside
the
definition
of
things
ordinarily
done
in
the
session
of
the
houses
of
which
they
are
a
member.
in
other
words,
i
simply
cannot
read
bodily
assault
into
it.
now,
i
would
say
contrary
was
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
what
would
occur
would
be
that
the
house
itself
to
take
immediate
steps
and
there
will
be
a
little
need
for
the
judiciary
or
the
executive
ever
to
concern
itself
with
that
type
of
a
situation.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
have
no
doubt
this
court
within
the
due
course
find
that
that
is
perfectly
appropriate
case
of
criminal
proceeding.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
would
say
and
i
think
that
is
correct
sir
because
i
think
that
this
is
an
extreme
mean
used
to
rectify
an
error
made
which
could
otherwise
be
rectified
without
the
need
for
physical
violence
and
i
think
as
a
practical
matter
mr.
justice
brennan,
we
may
be
debating
something
which
possibly
we
do
not
even
have
to
debate
in
that
it
may
well
be
that
because
it
occurred
on
federal
property,
you
might
reasonably
be
able
to
apply
1018
to
a
murder
for
example
which
occurred
under
circumstances
mr.
justice
had
outlined,
a
general
criminal
statute,
that
this
not
being
within
the
ambient
a
speech
or
debate
hence
permissible.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
am
directing
my
attention
justice
white
to
only
speech
or
debate
as
interpreted
by
this
court
as
sufficient
to
cover
this
particular
case.
i
am
not
arguing
a
general
legislative
community
as
substance.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
well,
i
suppose
on
dombrowski
against
eastland
can
be
read
for
that.
it
was
focused
more
on
the
right
of
the
staff
members
to,
shall
we
say,
have
the
benefit
of.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
yes
sir.
there
was.
there
definitely
was.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
that
was
dombrowski
of
course
sir
--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
no,
of
course
although
--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
civil
as
distinct
from
criminal.
so
in
both
of
those
instances
you
were
talking,
i
think
we
invariably
find
in
the
opinions
mr.
justice
white,
you
invariably
find
discussions
which
tend
to
talk
in
terms
of
legislative
immunity
of
a
short
hand
form
of
referring
to
what
is
given
or
the
protection
accorded
under
given
a
set
of
circumstances
and
we
most
frequently
see
them
in
the
context
of
liable
suits
in
which
we
frequently
see
them
in
the
context.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
would
expect
so
sir.
yes.
it
may
not
be
questioned
in
any
other
place
as
i
say
it
is
not
a
word
really
which
is
one
of
the
terms
we
are
accustomed
to
and
as
the
chief
justice
said
in
lower
court
opinion
in
powell
in
connection
with
that,
it
may
not
be
questioned
has
implicit
in
it,
it
need
not
answer.
this
is
--
it
is
a
word.
it
has
more
meaning
really
than
our
standard
words
which
go
to
privilege.
it
speaks
in
terms
of
or
speech
or
debate,
he
may
not
be
questioned
in
any
other
place
and
the
historical
antecedents
of
it
very
clearly
indicate
that
they
were
talking
about
courts
in
the
older
days,
they
were
talking
about
courts
in
our
early
charter
provisions
and
our
early
state
constitutions,
that
is
exactly
what
they
had
in
mind.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
yes
sir.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
that
is
correct.
of
course
that
were
was
the
exclusion
of
the
congressman
from
the
congress,
question
of
the
liability
of
it
whether
is
in
the
house
for
their
conduct
in
that
connection
sir.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
think
it
is
a
practical
matter
mr.
justice
white,
it
has
an
even
a
broader
application
in
the
criminal
context
because
of
its
antecedents.
if
parliamentary
antecedents
with
the
fears
of
torture,
the
fears
of
commitment
to
the
power,
the
fears
of
imprisonment
which
were
used
to
dominate
the
members
of
parliament,
we
brought
that
forward
into
our
structure
as
it
came
into
our
articles
confederation
and
that
is
into
our
constitution,
largely
to
keep
the
executive
from
dominating
the
legislator.
therefore,
to
me
speech
or
debate,
the
crux
of
its
historical
antecedent
has
even
greater
application
in
the
criminal
field
because
that
was
one
of
the
major
things
which
the
framers
were
attempting
to
protect
the
legislator
against
was
intimidation
by
threat
of
grand
jury,
by
threat
of
even
a
baseless
indictment
which
been
read
a
political
being.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
think
mr.
chief
justice,
the
point
which
i
make
as
respect
to
that
is
this.
one
has
to
do
with
conduct,
physical
conduct
if
the
court
please,
the
other
has
to
do
with
attempting
to
motivate.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
well,
i
am
unclear
in
the
hypothetical
which
the
court
puts
to
me.
who
would
be
the
subject
matter
of
the
indictment,
the
man
who
made
the
threat?
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
not
the
receiver.
in
that
connection,
i
would
take
the
position
that
the
threatenor
should
be
subject
to
and
i
am
sure
it
would
be
subject
to
criminal
prosecution.
if
you
were
attempting
to
inquire
into
why
the
man
who
got
the
bribe
voted,
a
motivation
of
being
the
question
which
you
would
be
posing
in
order
to
prove
the
bribe,
i
would
think
that
you
would
have
a
interdiction
of
a
speech
or
debate
clause
as
against
inquiry
into
the
acceptor’s
motivations
sir.
now,
contrary
why
the
man
who
gives
the
bribe,
you
are
not
inquiring
into
his
motive
as
respect
they
vote.
you
are
inquiring
into
his
attempting
to
motivate
another
and
somewhere
between
those
two
explains
would
lie
the
line
of
determination
where
i
believe
this
court
would
say
no
as
to
the
recipient,
if
you
are
trying
to
prove
his
motive
and
yes
as
to
the
bribe
giver
if
you
are
attempting
to
prove
that
he
was
instituting
conduct
which
would
motivate
another.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
yes
mr.
justice
white?
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
would
say
mr.
justice
white
the
answer
to
that
has
got
to
be
in
the
basic
for
the
clause.
assume
that
the
house
may
give
up
its
prerogative
so
to
speak,
but
i
think
the
court
must
look
deeper.
the
prerogative
is
not
there
only
to
protect
that
house.
they
put
there
to
protect
the
persons
who
elected
the
members
of
that
house
as
well
as
the
members.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
there
are
some
harping
at
judge
hart's
colloquy
in
the
government's
brief,
but
judge
hart
put
a
similar
posture
in
the
colloquy
before
the
court,
the
lower
court
and
i
think
that
this
is
the
reasoning
which
the
lower
court
was
using,
if
they
cannot
do
it,
how
they
can
combine
with
another
house
which
has
no
power
over
their
members
and
give
up
this
right
which
frankly
as
bottomed
on
the
right
of
the
people's
representative
to
be
protected
in
freedom
of
speech,
freedom
of
debate
and
as
that
clause
has
been
interpreted
by
this
court
through
the
years.
thank
you.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
address
myself
first
to
the
suggestion
made
by
the
solicitor
general
in
his
closing
comments.
first,
i
would
request
to
the
court
that
attention
be
given
to
the
five
particular
subject
matter
which
is
now
asserted
by
the
solicitor
general
was
never
argued
below.
it
was
not
the
textural
aspect
of
the
case
when
it
was
before
the
district
judge.
what
was
before
the
district
judge
was
perfectly
clearly
set
forth
in
connection
with
the
debate
in
colloquy
and
in
connection
with
the
record
of
the
case
as
it
there
existed.
government
counsel
there
said
that
under
this
indictment
and
i
am
quoting
from
page
28
of
the
record
extract.
we
are
not
contending
that
what
is
being
charged
here,
that
is
the
activity
by
brewster
was
anything
other
than
a
legislative
act.
we
are
not
ducking
the
question,
it
is
squarely
presented.
they
are
legislative
acts.
we
are
not
going
to
quibble
over
that.
now,
the
important
point
to
this
case
as
we
see
it
is
this,
this
case
does
not
test
the
outer
limits
of
speech
or
debate.
this
case
falls
squarely
within
the
hard
core
of
speech
or
debate.
in
the
earlier
arguments
and
in
the
brief
that
the
government
which
is
earlier
submitted
in
this
case,
the
government
conceded
that
while
the
precise
limits
of
johnson
may
be
a
little
vague,
“we
do
not
contend
that
the
clause
for
text
only
speech.”
and
then
they
went
back
to
two
formal
holdings
of
this
court
in
the
powell
case
and
in
the
kilbourn
case,
committee
reports,
resolutions,
any
act
of
voting
are
equally
covered
as
are
“things
generally
done
in
a
session
of
the
house
by
one
of
its
members
in
relation
to
the
business
before
it.”
that
has
never
been
a
doubted
proposition.
it
was
against
the
text
of
that
and
this
court’s
clause
as
it’s
imposed
it
on
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
the
district
judge
hart
made
his
decision
against
the
background
of
that
he
plays
an
indictment
which
followed
as
the
solicitor
general
has
candidly
conceded
to
the
court
and
into
question,
official
conduct
in
the
nature
of
action,
vote
and
decision.
now
this
illusive
memorandum
of
conferences
was
known
to
trial
counsel
below
and
certainly
appellate
counsel
are
charged
with
knowledge
of
what
trial
counsel
did
know.
all
we
put
that
before
the
court
before
in
the
first
instance
was
to
make
the
court
aware
that
this
case
was
not
decided
in
a
vacuum.
that
there
was
justification
for
the
comment
by
judge
hart
“based
on
the
facts
of
this
case”
that
this
was
not
decided
in
the
abstract.
as
one
of
the
justices
--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
it
was
not
decided
in
the
abstract.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
well,
i
am
coming
to
that
sir.
as
one
of
the
justices,
mr.
chief
justice
inquired
before,
i
think
it
was
justice
stewart.
did
not
the
indictment
say
action,
vote
or
decision?
and
it
did
sir,
but
that
was
simply
clarified
and
in
that
regard,
our
position
in
that
matter
is
this,
basically
when
a
congressman
using,
of
course
that
is
general
phraseology,
when
a
congressman
is
accused
of
improper
conduct,
improper
motivation,
then
there
must
come
at
some
point
in
the
preceding
when
either
before
the
grand
jury
action
is
brought
to
stop
improper
intrusion
into
areas
covered
by
speech
or
debate
or
if
after
indictment
when
a
trial
court
has
occasion
to
have
access
to
the
precise
facts
upon
which
the
application
of
speech
or
debate
is
made
apparent.
we
say
that
that
is
what
happened
in
this
particular
case.
it
was
not
challenged
at
the
grand
jury
level
as
this
true
in
another
case
currently
pending
and
as
to
which
i
will
make
no
detailed
comment,
but
it
was
challenged
by
a
12
(b)
(1)
motion
as
soon
as
it
could
be.
that
is
to
say,
we
put
before
the
court
and
the
government
cooperated
in
putting
before
the
court
that
what
was
being
questioned
in
this
case
was
legislative
conduct,
not
the
postulated
absence
of
legislative
conduct.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
it
is,
mr.
justice
marshall,
my
answer
to
that
would
not
be
a
direct
when
it
would
be
this
sir.
you
would
be
testing
motivation
if
you
say
that
a
given
phase
of
legislative
conduct
whether
it
be
committee
discussion,
whether
it
be
a
report
written
by
a
given
congressman
was
motivated
in
one
way
or
by
one
set
of
circumstances.
you
then
fall
within
the
ambit
of
speech
or
debate.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
the
taking
of
the
bribe
is
in
the
concept
of
an
indictment
like
that
before
this
court
sir.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
oh!
no,
it’s
not.
you
are
asking
me
sir
whether
it
is
said
in
indictment
that
a
particular
speech
was
made
as
a
--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
now,
i
will
have
to
answer
that
directly
sir,
that
is
not
in
the
indictment.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
well,
i
respectfully
submit
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
no,
he
is
in
the
same
category
as
any
other
congressman
who
does
the
same
thing
that’s
subject
to
penalty
in
his
own
house,
which
has
the
right
to
question
him.
but
he
is
to
be
questioned
in
no
other
place
if
the
language
is
keen
to
debates
sir.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
if
he
does
not
make
a
speech,
then
we
are
back
to
the
inquiry
of
the
breadth
of
speech
or
debate,
are
we
strictly
talking
speech
or
debate?
and
we
say
since
kilbourn
in
1881
(voice
overlap)
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
let
me
put
it
this
way
mr.
justice
marshall
--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
no,
i
would
say,
what
was
left
opened
in
johnson,
mr.
justice
marshall
was
the
issue
of
whether
there
was
an
outer
perameter
where
this
court,
will
say
that
speech
or
debate
does
not
protect.
but
in
this
instant
case,
speech
or
debate
has
an
applicable
principle
was
conceded
before
the
lower
court.
now,
the
practical
matter,
the
issue
is
posed
in
this
fashion
in
the
lower
court.
they
say,
we
say
it
was
legislative
activity.
they
would
motivate
it
in
his
legislative
conduct
by
the
acceptance
of
improper
sums
of
money.
we
say,
and
this
is
the
trust
in
lower
court
and
also
in
the
government’s
original
brief
in
this
court,
that
this
however
falls
out
of
that
heartland
of
speech
or
debate
and
is
within
the
exclusion
which
this
court
reserved
when
johnson
was
decided.
we
say
to
the
contrary
that
on
that
issue
as
posed
before
the
lower
court
that
what
was
done
in
this
case
and
the
facts
that
alleged
in
this
case
falls
squarely
within
what
was
covered
by
johnson
and
do
not
fall
with
any
exclusion.
we
do
not
say
that
it
is
not
possible
to
postulate
a
situation
which
will
take
it
to
the
outer
limit
or
speech
or
debate
and
beyond
the
outer
limit
of
speech
or
debate,
so
that
there
may
be
an
indictable
crime.
but
as
was
said
in
the
johnson
case,
it
is
our
position
that
speech
or
debate
extends
at
least
so
far
as,
and
that
is
the
language
of
this
court
in
our
opinion.
and
we
say
it
does
clearly
extends
so
far
as
to
protect
against
inquiry
as
respects
legislative
acts
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
and
that
is
the
way
in
which
this
whole
issue
came
up.
these
assumptions,
these
hypotheses,
these
hypothetical
illustrations
were
never
part
of
the
case
when
it
was
before
judge
hart.
and
there
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
this
court
can
and
will,
on
some
occasion,
take
the
speech
or
debate
clause,
analyze
and
find
it
without
application
to
certain
sets
of
conducts
as
for
example
in
burton
and
as
in
johnson,
where
the
conduct
is
not
related
to
legislative
act
but
it
is
related
to
executive.
we
agree
that
that
is
the
fast
ruling
of
this
court
--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
suggest
sir
that
senator
burton
would
have
love
to
have
chief
justice
express
similar
opinions
back
at
the
time
of
this
case,
but
i
think
that
decided,
i
think
that
the
executive
--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
but
it
is
not
a
legislative
conduct
as
(inaudible).
the
legislative
process,
turning
as
it
does
necessarily
to
the
absorption
of
the
representative,
by
of
his
various
constituents’
wishes
and
desires
of
the
need
to
represent
them
in
connection
with
subject
matter
which
come
before
for
political
judgments
and
for
judgments
as
respect
to
policy,
he
must
be
free
and
he
is
indeed
free.
and
this
is
a
significant
aspect
and
the
significant
posture
of
a
senator
or
a
congressman
in
this
regard.
he
must
always
be
open
to
suggestion,
to
pressure.
he
must
always
be
open
to
the
possibility
that
an
executive
desiring
to
penalized
someone
who
has
voted
against
the
executive,
may
wish
to
posture
him
against
his
voting
record,
with
his
list
of
contributors,
with
an
inference
to
follow,
if
unfriendly
grand
jury
chooses
to
draw
it,
that
there
is
a
necessary
connection
between
the
assemblage
of
the
money
necessary
to
win
a
campaign
and
the
favorable
votes
be
it
on
fishing,
be
it
on
oil,
be
it
on
what
may
it
be.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
it
is
because,
if
you
please
mr.
chief
justice,
it
is
because
the
government
postured
its
case
before
the
district
judge
and
said,
we
expect
to
prove
this
case
by
proving
legislative
acts
of
senator
brewster
and
the
judge
took
their
representation
if
this
was
so,
it
became
a
concession
of
record
and
it
was
a
concession
predicated
on
known
facts,
known
to
the
judge,
known
to
counsel,
and
his
opinion
expressly
stated
based
on
that
facts
of
this
case,
so
that
it
was
not
simply
a
case
of
taking
up
hypotheticals.
the
government
had
not
postured
either
its
indictment
or
it
is
a
presentation
on
the
hypothetical
ability
to
reach
outside
and
find
some
circumstance
which
we
permit
the
drawing
of
a
claim
that
it
was
outside
speech
or
debate.
it
had
challenged
the
lower
court
by
bringing
in
any
indictment
squarely
designed
to
fall
within
speech
or
debate
as
johnson
defined
it
and
put
the
issue
to
the
district
judge
to
say
that
this
was
a
narrowly
drawn
statute.
that’s
exactly
the
way
they
attend
to
the
posture
it,
sir.
now
under
those
circumstances,
it
was
clean
and
clear
that
they
post
the
issue
to
the
trial
court,
are
you
now
willing
to
say
that
if
we
take
a
statute
which
we
deemed
to
be
a
precise
narrowly
drawn
statute
that
you
will
say
that
speech
or
debate
must
surrender
to
it.
and
that
was
the
way
it
was
before
the
court
and
the
facts
were
before
the
court
at
what
was
being
challenged
with
legislative
conduct
of
the
senator.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
yes,
sir.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
do
not
believe
that
that
is
a
necessary
corollary.
i
think,
by
the
reservation
which
was
made
by
the
court
in
johnson,
it
was
indicated
that
there
might
be
an
area
where
such
a
bribe
could
be
penalized.
we
argue
as
you
are
aware
sir,
in
our
brief,
that
it
being
a
power
granted
to
each
of
the
houses,
to
inquire
into
motivation
of
members
and
not
granted
to
the
houses
as
houses
of
congress
to
legislate
on
generally,
that
they
cannot
take
away
the
power
which
the
people
gave
or
the
protection
that
people
gave
their
representative.
but
coming
pass
that
point,
i
would
say
sir
that,
in
for
example,
the
bribed
congressman’s
immunity
from
prosecution
which
is
common
in
all
private
law
review
fights
extensively
and
is
one
the
leading
works
dealing
with
the
subject
matter.
now,
the
suggestion
made
that
a
properly
drawn
statute
might
be
structured
which
could
permit
it.
we
are
somewhat
ambivalent
on
that,
since
we
argue
that
there
is
no
constitutional
power
to
delegate
that
right,
the
section
5
right,
over
to
the
courts
for
inquiry.
but
basically
i
would
say,
yes
there
may
be
a
chance,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
where
it
could
be
done.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
well,
as
a
practical
matter,
i
would
think
that
some
of
the
--
in
the
first
argument
in
this
case
we
have
a
series
of
hypothetical
questions
to
counsel
for
the
appellee
and
it
was
an
attempt
really
to
move
away
from
the
heartland
of
speech
or
debate,
and
outward.
mr.
justice
marshall
poses
a
somewhat
similar
problem.
are
we
at
the
outer
limits
of
speech
or
debate,
where
a
bribe
is
a
accepted
and
agreed
to
where
there
is
no
need
to
introduce
any
evidence
concerning
official
action
taken,
any
official
vote
given,
any
official
resolution
granted,
any
official
speech
given,
are
we
going
to
reach
the
point
where
that
the
court
will
now
say,
you
are
sufficiently
away
from
inquiry
and
the
legislative
acts
that
we
should
sustain
the
prosecution?
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
well,
i
would
say
that,
i
understood
your
question
to
be
sir,
if
i
could
postulate
a
circumstance.
i
am
not
saying
that
it
is
only
circumstance.
i
would
suggest
this
to
you
sir,
that
if
the
indictment
was
premised
on
a
set
of
facts
which
would
permit
proof,
that
a
given
man
had
agreed
to
take
a
given
bribe
and
then
he
did
nothing
that
you
might
possibly
be
able
to
sustain
the
indictment
because
the
agreement
itself
constituted
the
bribe.
but,
where
you
have,
on
the
other
end
of
the
edge
line,
that
is
to
say
that
he
was
alleged
to
have
taking
a
bribe
to
be
motivated
to
vote
for
and
did
vote
for,
then
you
open
up
inquiry
and
to
the
very
area
of
his
conduct
which
is
proscribed
by
speech
or
debate.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
well,
this
is
why
the
outer
limits
of
the
problem
as
i
say.
we
focus
our
attention
on
them
as
wholly
by
virtue
of
hypotheticals
from
various
justices
of
the
last
hearing.
we
think
that
focuses
on
the
wrong
issue
in
the
case
that
is
not
this
case
as
we
can
see.
this
case
is
differently
postured.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
quite
agree
that
the
court
is
correct
in
trying
to
test
the
outer
reach
of
any
decision
which
it
makes.
but
i
remind
you
sir
that
this
case
is
before
the
court
under
the
criminal
appeals
act
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
that
there
is
something
in
the
record
of
this.
\not
in
the
indictment
sir.
i
have
never
been
in
that
provision.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
am
sorry
sir?
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
no,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
indictment
is
all
we
have
mr.
justice
marshall
that
has
been
our
point.
the
indictment
clearly
does
cover
action,
vote,
and
decision.
in
other
words,
the
indictment
says--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
the
indictment
covers
his
action
(voice
overlap)
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
you
postulated
the
same
hypothetical
to
me
at
the
last
theory
and
again
i
would
have
to
give
you,
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
same
answer
which
i
gave.
it
depends
on
whether
this
indictment
which
is
challenged
and
which
is
before
the
court
would
require
proof
as
respects
to
his
legislative
conduct
thereafter.
if
that
be
so,
then
we
say
(voice
overlap)
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
do
not,
sir,
read
johnson
if,
mr.
justice,
you
are
stating
out
as
a
whole
in
johnson.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
no,
i
do
not
believe
sir
that
is
what
was
left
open
in
johnson.
what
was
left
open
in
johnson
was,
as
this
court
put
in
an
opinion,
“we
live
for
another
day.”
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
he
is
being
charged
with,
under
this
indictment?
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
in
this
case
sir,
he
is
being
charged
with
bribery
and
with
aiding
or
abetting.
it
is
under
182
which
is
the
aid
or
abet
provision
under
201
(c)
or
(g).
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
201
(c),
sir.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
the
government
alleges,
in
this
indictment,
that
--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
would
suggest,
sir
that
the
government
must
necessarily
prove
that
it
was
to
influence
him
in
the
performance
of
an
official
act.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
that
is
correct
and
that
is
the
allegation.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
and
that
act
would
say
--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
am
suggesting
to
you
sir
that
what
was
done
in
this
case
was
that
the
legislative
conduct
has
alleged
in
his
action,
vote
and
decision,
or
what
they
intended
to
prove
and
that
is
the
very
area
of
inquiry
which
is
foreclosed
by
speech
or
debate.
now,
i
am
not
suggesting
that
the
way
that
is
foreclosed
by
speech
or
debate
is
the
conversation
having
to
do
with
whether
or
not
a
bribe
would
or
would
not
be
paid.
i
am
saying
that
government
said,
in
this
case,
we
intend
to
show
the
receipt
of
campaign
contributions
because
the
first
in
count,
which
the
solicitor
general
selected
as
typical,
and
which
i
will
use
as
typical
if
the
court
will
keep
in
mind
that
count
nine
has
a
slight
variant
and
it
refers
backward
to
the
receipt
of
moneys
there
for
as
distinct
or
action
taken
there
for
to
as
distinct
from
anticipated
action.
it
is
alleged
in
this
indictment
that
the
defendant
sought,
accepted,
received
and
agreed
to
received
the
sum
of
$5,000.00
for
himself
and
for
an
entity
the
dc
committee
for
maryland
education.
a
political
fund
in
other
words,
it
is
what
is
alleged
to
be
involved.
then
we
go
on
to
say
and
we
intend
to
show
that
this
was
in
return
for
being
influenced
in
the
performance
of
his
official
act.
in
respect
to
his
action,
vote
and
decision
and
it
was
to
that
subject
matter
that
assistant
united
states
attorney
addressed
himself,
when
asked
by
the
court
as
to
whether
the
act
which
were
challenged
were
legislative
in
nature
and
he
said,
"yes
sir,
they
are,"
and
that
was
in
accord
with
the
understanding
of
everybody
concerned,
that
there
were
legislative
acts.
and
that
being
the
case,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
this
was
an
attempt
to
precisely
stage
this
case
for
that
decision.
it
was
so
decided
and
not
all
square
in
johnson.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
well,
i
suspect
sir
that
very
many
times
the
great
confident
trial
judges
aren’t
perfectly
willing
and
indeed
need
to
rely
on
an
open
concession
such
as
was
made
by
the
assistant
of
united
states
attorney
in
this
case
that
it
was
legislative
conduct
which
was
challenged.
and
that
against
the
background
of
a
fully
known
revelation
to
the
trial
judge
of
precisely
what
factual
data
that
government
intended
to
prove
which
they
supplied
as
they
say
is
pre-handed
fashion
to
the
defendant
but
did
not
put
into
the
record
because
of
the
very
good
chance
of
pretrial,
prejudicial
publicity
in
a
case
for
trial
then
pending
shortly
after
the
hearing
date
of
the
motions
which
were
then
before
the
court.
and
it
was,
as
i
suggest
to
the
court,
a
perfectly
useful,
desirable,
and
necessary
proposition
that
courts
proceed
on
this
particularly
areas
whereas
the
court
said
in
powell.
the
congressman
should
be
relieved
of
the
obligation
to
defend
himself.
there
is,
under
the
decision
of
this
court,
no
constitutional
basis
for
making
a
crime
out
of
conduct
where
you
must
necessarily
go
to
motivation
for
legislative
conduct
in
order
to
prove
that
a
given
sum
of
money
was
received
or
had
by
a
particular
man
in
question
by
reason
of
a
specific
motivation
on
his
part.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
order
to
put
our
position
in
this
case
in
proper
context,
i
think
i
return
to
the
basic
principle
from
which
we
rely
may
be
help.
first
of
all,
we
premise
our
argument
on
the
announced
concept
as
laid
down
by
this
court,
that
one
of
the
functions
of
speech
and
debate
clause
is
to
relieve
the
senator
of
a
duty
of
expanding
itself.
that
is
announced
in
several
of
the
recent
expositions
as
respect
to
meaning
of
speech
or
debate.
we
further
would
state
to
the
court
that
this
imposes
a
duty
on
a
trial
of
such
cases
or
one
before
in
such
case
comes
to
inquire
into
the
case
which
is
intended
to
be
made
by
the
prosecutor
against
the
defendant
on
the
particular
facts
of
that
case.
now
keep
in
mind,
if
you
will
please
that
our
opposition
is
that
if
there
is
an
interrogation
which
is
violative
of
speech
or
debate,
and
an
indictment
has
already
been
returned
or
has
been
at
least
one
violation
of
speech
or
debate
in
the
very
inquiry
which
was
the
underlying,
critical
for
the
indictment
which
is
returned.
therefore,
the
rules
of
the
district
judge
before
such
a
case
comes,
to
look
to
the
facts
of
the
case,
to
look
to
the
indictment,
and
to
see
whether
what
has
been
done,
is
a
set
of
circumstances
which
leads
to
application
of
speech
or
debate
and
which
are
properly
to
cause
him
to
enter
into
the
case
for
the
purpose
of
dismissing
it
because
he
has
an
obligation
to
honor
the
senator’s
right,
not
to
be
called
upon
to
defend,
if
the
case
is
violative
of
speech
or
debate.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
yes
,sir.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
as
a
practical
matter,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
way
we
see
it
and
what
we
premise
our
argument
on
is
a
direct
quote
out
of
the
johnson
case
and
in
that
case
this
court
said,
"speaking
thereof
conspiring
to
give
a
speech
in
return
for
a
compensation
from
private
sources."
however
reprehensible,
we
believe
that
the
speech
or
debate
clause
extends
at
least
so
far
as
to
prevent
it
from
being
made
the
basis
of
a
criminal
charge.
speaking
backward
through
the
quality
of
that
as
it
sufficiently
indictable
basis.
and
i
think
the
policy
considerations
sir,
which
is
behind
that
is
simply
this,
the
clause
is
designed
to
prevent
harassment
of
the
legislator
by
either
an
unfriendly
executive
or
by
an
unfriendly
judiciary
if
that
be
the
case.
but
in
the
first
instance,
the
grand
jury
investigation.
it
is
to
shield
him
from
being
hailed
in
before
the
grand
jury,
queried
as
respects
to
his
motives.
now,
if
i
may
postulate
a
case
which
is
illustrative,
i
think
it
would
run
this
way,
if
the
court
does
not
vindicate
speech
or
debate
as
stopping
grand
jury
inquiry,
is
it
not
perfectly
possible
for
an
unfriendly
prosecutor
to
hail
in
any
member
of
the
congress,
put
before
that
grand
jury
a
list
of
the
contributors
who
contributed
to
his
last
campaign
and
within
the
frame
or
reference
to
the
bribery
statute,
then
put
against
that
testimony
that
a
given
senator
and/or
congressman
voted,
in
a
particular
way,
favorable
to
the
very
interest
who
had
contributed
so
heavily
to
his
campaign
funding
at
the
time
when
he
ran?
now,
from
that,
it
would
be
postulated
that
you
may
draw
the
inference
that
the
vote
favorable
to
whatever
interest
it
may
be,
could
be
said
to
be
or
an
inference
could
be
drawn
that
it
was
predicated
upon
the
earlier
contribution
of
money
to
his
campaign.
it
is
this
peculiar
aspect
of
the
elective
process
the
need
of
the
representative
to
get
himself
elected
which
sets
apart
the
legislative
from
all
the
balance
of
government
with
the
exception
of,
of
course
the
president
and
vice
president
who
are
in
a
position
where
they
necessarily
are
participants
in
political
campaigns
in
order
to
become
elected
representatives
of
the
people.
but
basically,
we
think
the
policy
is
cleanly
stated
and
we
think
the
policy
a
wise
one
in
that,
the
essence
of
the
charge
again
is
this
court
said
in
johnson,
and
speaking
there
to
the
johnson
charge,
in
this
context,
is
that
the
congressman’s
conduct
was
improperly
motivated
and
as
well
appear
that
is
precisely
what
the
speech
or
debate
clause
generally
forecloses
from
executive
and
judicial
inquiry.
now,
coming
back
to
my
original
view
of
the
matter,
i
would
say,
sir,
that
we
approached
it
this
way,
the
court
owes
an
obligation
because
of
the
prayer,
the
court
i
am
talking
now
the
court
hearing
such
a
case,
owes
was
an
obligation
to
examine
the
facts.
in
this
case,
it
was
conceded
by
the
government
and
found
by
the
court
that
a
necessary
root
of
the
case
was
inquiry
into
legislative
conduct.
and
it
was
at
that
stage
that
judge
hart
granted
the
motion.
now,
the
price
of
the
prosecution
to
this
sort
is,
that
it
would
seek
to
have
a
finder
of
fact,
usually
a
jury
but
not
necessary
so,
to
draw
inferences
between
the
campaign
funds
on
the
one
hand
and
positions
taken
politically.
judgment
calls
by
a
man
who
makes
policy,
by
a
man
who
does
indeed
address
himself
to
consideration
which
are
based
upon
the
well
being
of
those
whom
he
represents.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
well,
i
would
say
sir
that
while
you
are
corrected,
of
course
mr.
chief
justice,
that
they
were
in
a
case
which
dealt
with
that
subject
matter.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
think,
i
purported
[voice
overlap]
your
honor,
i
may
have
been
paraphrasing,
but
however
reprehensible
and
i
had
interspersed
conspiring
to
give
a
speech
in
return
for
payment
by
private
individuals.
maybe
we
believe
the
speech
or
debate
clause
extends
at
least
so
far,
that
was
of
course
in
the
aspect
of
the
case
where
they
were
discussing
a
speech
which
was
given
by
congressman
johnson.
and
i
believe
that
was
the
court’s
inquiry
to
me
and
the
answer
is
yes
sir
that
is
correct.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
well,
i
think
mr.
chief
justice,
this
court
sent
the
case
back
and
said
that
if
he
could
be
purged
of
elements
offensive
to
speech
or
debate,
there
was
no
reason
why
that
could
not
be
a
proceeding
which
would
go
to
the
other
aspects
of
the
case.
but
the
speech
was
so
thoroughly
intertwined
into
the
governmental
evidence
in
the
original
case.
it
was
impossible
to
sort
it
out
at
that
point
and
simply
went
back
in
the
trials.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
on
such
substantive
accounts
which
in
no
way
involve
the
speech
and
which
frankly
spoke
only
to
those
aspects
of
the
matter
which
had
to
do
with
his
having
interceded
in
connection
with
executive
affairs
as
distinct
from
performing
legislative
function.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
perfectly
grateful
sir.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
first
if
i
may
to
what
i
believe
is
a
misconception
on
the
part
of
the
solicitor
--mr.
solicitor
general
as
respect
the
factual
background
of
this
case
which
was
before
judge
hart
at
the
time
he
decided
the
issue
which
brings
the
case
here.
at
page
12
of
the
appendix,
there
appears
colloquy
between
counsel
and
the
court
and
i
am
quoting
from
my
own
remarks
to
judge
hart,
if
the
court
please.
i
made
the
statement
at
the
foot
of
page
12
and
at
the
top
of
page
13.
now,
in
this
regard
the
papers
which
have
been
filed
in
the
case
and
the
data
which
had
been
supplied
as
respects
to
the
claims
made
against
the
defendant
brewster
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
what
is
being
attacked
by
this
indictment
are
senator
brewster’s
votes
in
committee
and
his
votes
on
the
floor
and
his
activities
in
connection
with
what
the
supreme
court
has
described
as
things
generally
done
in
a
session
of
the
house
by
its
members.
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
who
was
arguing
the
case
came
back
to
this
point
at
page
28
of
the
appendix,
in
colloquy
again
with
judge
hart.
judge
hart
and
i
am
spiking
into
the
middle
of
a
court’s
question
at
about
midway
down,
page
28
of
the
appendix,
if
the
court
please.
“well,
tell
me
this?
does
the
indictment
in
any
ways
allege
that
brewster
did
anything
not
related
to
his
purely
legislative
functions.
mr.
barret:
we
are
not
contending
that
what
is
being
charged
here,
that
is
the
activity
by
brewster,
was
anything
other
than
a
legislative
act.
we
are
not
ducking
the
question.
it
is
squarely
presented.
they
are
legislative
acts.
we
are
not
going
to
quibble
over
that.”
now
this
is
against
the
background
if
the
court
please
of
there
having
been
supplied
on
a
confidential
basis
to
the
court,
a
memorandum
or
fact
which
replaced
a
statement
in
connection
with
a
motion
for
particulars
which
outlines
the
very
acts
which
were
addressed
to
the
particular
counts
and
what
the
assistant
was
telling
judge
hart
was,
your
honor,
we
do
not
contend
their
were
any
activities,
not
legislative
in
nature
and
that
is
fully
supportive
in
the
record,
in
this
case.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
that
is
correct,
and
we
would
say
--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
it
is
--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
it
is
--
it
is
a
confidential
memorandum
in
the
record.
i
simply
put
in
context
justice
brennan.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
would
say
mr.
justice
that
our
approach
that
is
that
the
assistant
did
make
a
concession
of
fact.
that
is
to
say
that
it
was
a
stipulation
which
was
made
by
the
assistant
as
respect
to
what
the
facts
of
the
case
were,
put
before
the
district
judge
and
the
district
judge
was
entitled
to
rely
upon
that
as
negating
the
need
for
additional
proof
in
this
particular
record,
although
the
confidential
memo
does
exist
in
the
records
of
the
district
court.
but
he
need
--
he
saw
no
need
to
an
effect
say,
we
will
put
on
the
record
the
full
confidential
memorandum
which
has
been
heretofore
filed
and
obviously
what
was
--
this
concern
of
counsel
and
the
court
at
that
point
in
time,
that
this
case
was
approaching
trial.
we
were
in
the
antecedent
stage
of
coming
to
trial
and
there
was
plenty
of
publicity
as
it
was.
there
was
no
need
to
have
further
newspaper
publicity
over
what
might
be
called
the
detailed
particulars
of
the
count,
but
judge
hart
did
not
need
to
put
it
on
the
record
where
the
assistant
said
flatly,
on
behalf
of
united
states
--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
mr.
justice,
the
approach
was
that
the
government
supplied
a
memorandum
of
alleged
--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
well,
all
i
--
the
only
answer
i
give
to
that
mr.
justice
marshall
is
--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
that
is
the
essence
of
the
memorandum,
but
nothing
except
legislative
acts
are
concerned,
sir.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
he
did
not
mention
the
memorandum,
yes
sir.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
no,
your
honor,
i
must
disagree
with
that.
what
he
was
saying
was
what
record
in
fact
disclosed,
that
is
to
say
--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
the
record
which
the
assistant
knew
about,
the
court
knew
about.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
the
record
in
the
case
before
judge
hart
sir.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
it
is
not,
except
in
the
form
of
the
concession
by
the
assistant.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
yes
mr.
justice
and
it
was
on
that
basis
that
i
was
trying
to
put
in
context
all
that
was
said
before
the
court
was
that
the
court
was
relying
on
facts
which
he
knew
to
be
concessions
in
the
record
by
united
states
openly
conceded
by
the
assistant
that
he
was
testing
legislative
acts
pure
and
simple.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
that
is
precisely
the
way
in
which
the
particulars
--
the
particulars
simply
addressed
themselves
to
the
allegation
of
the
indictment
which
was,
that
it
was
official
action
that
is
to
say
legislative
action
and
that
is
precisely
what
it
did.
on
the
given
day
at
a
given
time
in
a
given
committee
hearing,
in
a
given
both
on
the
floor
there
was
a
certain
step
taken
by
the
senator
which
is
alleged
to
show
that
his
action,
vote
and
decision
was
inferentially
at
least
premised
upon
antecedent
conduct
for
relations
with
spiegel
and/or
anderson.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
that
so
far
as
the
jurisdiction
and
so
far
as
the
constitutional
point
are
concerned
it
cannot
be
--
it
cannot
be
addressed
purely
on
the
basis
of
the
structure
of
the
indictment.
i
believe
however
in
fairness
to
the
court
that
all
of
these
items
which
appear
throughout
this
record
in
which
the
solicitor
general
had
not
caught
the
copy
items
in
that
context,
do
clearly
indicate
that
the
government
never
contended
it
was
anything
but
legislative
action
which
was
under
attack
here.
therefore
we
are
not
up
against
the
miasma
of
claims
that
he
may
have
acted
with
the
executive
for
example,
in
the
burton
type
situation
where
a
u.s.
senator
or
the
johnson
type
is
substantive
counts
where
a
congressman
works
into
the
executive
side
of
the
government
and
may
indeed
be
subjected
to
criminal
prosecution
as
was
congressman
johnson
in
connection
with
his
activities
before
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
in
the
executive
side.
now,
this
is
the
provision
which
we
have
taken
right
along
that
is
to
say
that,
basically
you
may
approach
the
entirety
of
the
problem
plus
the
constitutional
matter
and
of
the
jurisdictional
matter
on
the
basis
of
the
indictment
before
the
court
and
our
motion
to
dismiss
because
we
view
our
motion
to
dismiss,
if
the
court
please
in
this
posture,
under
the
earlier
teachings
of
the
court
in
cases
which
have
dealt
with
the
speech
or
debate
clause
that
is,
that
has
become
before
this
court,
it
has
taken
on
a
significance
which
is
to
the
effect
that
not
only
does
the
clause
give
protection
to
the
accused
senator
or
congressman
from
the
accusation
itself,
but
freeze
him
indeed
from
the
obligation
to
defend
himself.
this
of
course,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
will
recall
within
that
aspect
of
the
powell
case
in
the
lower
court
opinion,
the
circuit
court
opinion
written
while
you
were
on
the
bench
here
in
dc
and
it
also
was
the
teaching
of
the
dombrowski
case
and
ultimately
of
the
powell
case
before
this
court
when
it
came
up
here.
that
there
was
a
freedom
not
only
from
the
charge
itself,
but
in
addition,
it
was
intended
to
free
the
particular
public
servant
of
the
obligation
of
defending
himself
which
is
an
even
more
subtle
concept
in
the
sense
that
it
does
not
quite
come
to
the
same
form
of
immunity
that
we
normally
think
of.
it
has
stepped
in
ahead
and
what
we
had
done
by
our
motion
to
dismiss
in
this
case
was
invite
the
district
court’s
attention
to
the
operative
events
which
lead
to
our
being
in
a
position
where
we
could
say
to
the
court,
we
ought
to
be
protected
against
the
obligation
even
to
defend
ourselves
because
--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
defend
himself
from
that,
the
liability
--mr.
justice,
the
--
it
speaks
in
terms
of
being
questioned
in
any
other
place
--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
think
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
problem
we
are
up
against
there
is
whether
this
--
his
motivation
maybe
questioned,
that
is
to
say
(voice
overlap)
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
--
in
taking
--
what
is
this
money,
motive
for
accepting
the
money
is
really
what
you
are
asking
me
sir
and
to
that
extent,
you
see,
you
go
to
motivation
and
the
kilbourn
case
and
all
of
the
other
cases
have
addressed
themselves
not
only
to
acts
and
conduct,
but
anything
which
inquired
into
motive
for
the
vote.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
it
seems
to
me
that
the
speech
and
debate
clause
again.
keep
him
from
being
questioned
at
any
other
place
other
than
the
house
of
which
he
was
a
member.
we
do
not
contend
that
the
senator
or
a
congressman
go
scoot
free.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
yes,
but
in
order
to
prove
the
bribe
up
--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
that
is
correct.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
yes
your
honor,
if
i
may
address
myself
to
the
point.
mr.
justice
the
way
i
see
it,
it
is
--
the
situation
is
this.
at
the
time
he
accepted
the
money
in
order
to
prove
up
the
bribery
case,
simply
let
us
say
to
prove
that
he
undertook
to
do
a
certain
thing,
that
is
to
say
that
he
was
to
be
motivated
in
connection
with
official
conduct
otherwise
you
have
proven
no
bribes.
it
is
precisely
that
which
the
constitutional
clause
would
interdict
and
stopping
for
pariente.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
think
sir
that
constitutional
clause
has
taken
on
the
gloss
(ph)
of
the
cases
which
have
interpreted
it
all
away
down.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
it
seems
to
the
me
the
kilbourn
case
does
sir
in
connection
with
motive,
inquiry
into
motive
in
any
place
other
than
the
house
of
representatives
(voice
overlap)
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
understand
the
proposition
which
the
court
puts
to
me,
but
i
trust
it
is
not
thought
to
be
this
situation
sir,
because
this
was
alleged
to
be
for
a
vote
for
various
conduct
--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
yes
sir.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
one,
well,
initial
counts,
the
first
counts,
all
deal
with
the
pending
or
to
be
pending
before
him.
the
last
count,
sir,
does
the
201
(g),
which
has
to
do
with
past
conduct
as
distinct
from
anticipatory
conduct.
so
he
is
alleged
to
have
received
in
connection
with
his
vote
and
his
action
and
his
official
conduct
in
connection
with
either
anticipate
it
or
coming
legislation,
legislation
pending
in
the
congress
and
in
the
last
count,
with
legislation
which
had
been
in
an
earlier
context.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
no
problem.
this
is
why
i
say
it
to
the
court
that
the
concession
by
the
assistant
that
what
is
talked
about
is
to
vote
and
what
is
talked
about
is
legislative
conduct,
pure
and
simple.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
that
is
correct,
in
return
for
being
influenced
and
in
respect
to
his
action,
vote
and
decision.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
to
stay
away
and
it
stains
--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
would
sir.
i
would
think
that
in
that
instance
again
you
would
be
inquiring
into
the
motive
of
a
legislature
--
legislator
and
i
believe
sir
that
speech
or
debate
clause
would
protect
against
inquiry.
now
as
i
--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
that
is
correct
sir,
that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
but
one
has
got
--
one
is
a
necessary
quantum
of
proof
in
order
to
proof
up
the
other.
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
the
johnson
case,
mr.
justice
stewart,
you
have
got
a
number
of
aspects
to
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
one
maybe
the
exclusion
of
evidence
at
the
trial
for
example
because
if
this
case
had
gone
to
trial
and
a
testimony
had
been
elicited
or
sought
to
be
elicited
which
had
to
do
with
motive
for
his
acceptance
of
particular
money,
immediately
you
would
have
had
confronting
the
court,
the
problem
of
to
what
extent
as
an
evidentiary
matter,
assuming
that
we
do
not
meet
it
as
a
jurisdictional
matter,
this
problem
was
raised
also
in
the
powell
case,
does
speech
or
debate
address
itself
to
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
in
one
phase
of
our
brief,
we
have
suggested
that
it
is
does
in
the
sense
that
this
is
a
power,
delegated
constitutionally
to
one
branch
of
government
and
should
not
intruded
upon
by
another.
in
another
portion
of
the
brief,
we
have
suggested
that
the
congress
jointly
cannot
do
what
the
constitution
gives
to
each
of
the
houses
respectively.
the
power
to
punish
its
own
members,
so
that
there
still
is
in
the
background
of
this
problem,
the
question
of
is
it
jurisdictional.
now,
if
it
is
not
jurisdictional
and
we
do
suggest
at
one
point
that
it
maybe.
it
certainly,
under
the
johnson
case
and
i
think
under
any
rule
or
reason,
it
has
the
application
in
the
problems
of
admissibility
of
evidence
at
trial
where
you
run
into
constitutional
interdiction,
if
you
try
to
elicit
the
johnson
type
testimony,
did
you
vote,
why
you
did
you?
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
yes
sir.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
would
certainly
say,
sir,
that
both
of
those
actions
of
his
would
be
subject
to
discipline
in
his
house.
i
am
simply
addressing
myself
in
this
instance
to
saying
that
they
should
not
be
questioned
in
any
other
place,
which
is
what
the
speech
and
debate
says.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
for
improper
conduct,
no,
for
improper
conduct
in
connection
with
holding
out
that
he
would
be
willing
to
be
influenced
in
his
vote.
that
is
--
that
they
hold,
i
hopefully
a
possible
story
is
[laughter]
equality
of
bribing
both
ways
and
you
ought
to
get
a
fair
result,
but
[laughter]
the
fishing
aspect
of
it,
i
do
not
think
would
be
a
subject
to
discipline,
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
come
into
the
--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
do
sir.
the
legislative,
if
the
--
mr.
justice,
your
characterization
of
legislative
conduct,
yes
sir,
i
do.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
yes
sir,
i
do.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
it
could
take
the
form
as
it
had
in
the
past
illustrations
which
are
found
throughout
the
various
studies
of
the
congress.
it
can
--
expulsion
for
example,
suspension
from
the
house,
even
imprisonment
and
disciplined
by
fine
maybe
imposed
within
the
framework
of
the
house’s
ability
--
house
of
congress’s
ability
to
discipline
their
own
members.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
that
is
one
portion
of
our
brief,
mr.
justice
brennan,
we
address
ourself
to
that
and
suggest
that
where
the
congress
allocates
to
each
house,
that
is
not
delegated
to
the
congress
as
a
whole
for
the
purpose
of
legislating
concern,
now
i
think
sir,
we
have
eliminated
or
admitted
only
one
and
that
is
a
major
thing
to
a
politician
and
that
is
the
people
at
the
polls.
they
have
the
absolute
right
to
turn
him
out
and
this
of
course
is
one
of
the
political
realities
of
the
whole
situation
which
ultimately
must
be
faced
by
everybody
who
must
run
for
office
and
it
is
one
of
the
real
justifications
for
giving
a
political
judgment
as
respect
to
proper
punishment
to
a
political
forum
as
distinct
from
a
judicial
forum.
it
permits
the
testing
of
the
conduct
of
the
members.
as
the
solicitor
general
argues,
he
says
get
it
out
of
the
political
forum,
put
into
the
courts
where
the
dispassionate
grand
jury,
the
dispassionate
judges
may
hear
it.
we
say
on
the
other
hand
that
every
reasonable
practicality
having
to
deal
with
men
who
must
pick
up,
be
elected
to
office,
to
men
who
must
seek
campaign
contribution,
to
a
men
who
necessarily
must
confer
with,
consult
with
and
be
influenced
by
their
constituents
day
after
day,
in
order
to
avoid
an
interest
being
drawn
in
a
grand
jury
by
an
overactive
(voice
overlap).
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
believe
sir
that
you
will
find
that
this
philosophy,
that
is
to
say,
the
philosophy
of
the
right
to
a
political
philosophy
is
for
example
covered
by
mr.
kirby
in
his
study
for
the
bar
of
the
city
of
new
york
as
respect
to
matter.
it
is
covered
by
a
harvard
law
review
article
(voice
overlap)
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
do
not
believe
sir
that
i
can
falsely
represent
that
there
is
a
specific
statement
made
by
one
of
the
framers
of
the
constitution
as
respect
to
that.
but
certainly,
shortly
after
it
is
was
put
into
effect
as
a
constitutional
provision,
it
was
--
it
has
been
interpreted
in
effect
to
retain
this
right
within
the
political
body,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
you
do
have
such
the
history
here,
mr.
justice
brennan,
but
i
would
submit
that
you
also
have
coincident
with
it.
you
have
running
along
side
of
the
1853
statutes,
you
have
repeated
assertions
by
the
congress
or
the
houses
of
the
congress
of
their
right
to
seek
out
the
alleged
bribe
taker,
the
oath's
aims
type
case,
all
of
which
are
fully
discussed
in
the
historical
footnotes
in
our
brief
and
in
1873,
there
into
the
(inaudible)
scandal
in
depth
for
the
alleged
bribery
in
the
congress,
for
the
executive
not
attempting
to
use
the
1853
statute
for
any
prosecution.
you
have
the
repeated
assertion
of
congress’
right
to
fulfill
its
constitutional
obligation
to
discipline
its
own
members
sir.
now,
in
connection
with
the
1853
statute,
i
believe
sir
that
this
should
be
kept
in
mind.
certainly
the
1853
statute
was
designed
to
cover
situations
such
as
the
case,
u.s.
against
burton,
such
as
the
case
of
u.s.
versus
johnson,
where
the
whole
thrust
forward
of
the
case
was
on
the
basis
that
johnson
had
been
bought,
he
was
bribed
--
he
was
a
bribed
congressman.
that
conspiracy
element
was
admittedly
the
textual
basis
for
the
case.
but
it
was
a
claimed
bribery
and
the
government
advanced
many
of
the
same
arguments
there
that
are
advanced
here
and
they
analogized
to
and
reasoned
from
bribery
statutes,
including
the
one
which
is
before
us
now.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
justice
harlan
certainly
did
sir
and
it
is
(voice
overlap)
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
well,
i
am
not
sure
that
justice
harlan
by
reserving
it
suggested
necessarily
that
this
court
would
--
would
when
it
came
up,
still
considered
an
adequate
case.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
precisely,
and
if
you
have
not
decided
it
sir
and
i
submit
you
can
decide
yes
or
you
might
decide
no
as
the
case
maybe.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
yes
sir.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
you
are
addressing
yourself
precisely
to
the
set
of
facts
that
existed
in
oakes
ames
case
in
1873
when
the
congress
tried
to
issue
out
themselves
and
the
courts
did
not
intercede,
that
was
the
distribution
of
stock
in
connection
with
the
credit
mobilier
is
set
up
where
8,
10
or
12
that
is
spread
throughout
the
congress
as
a
practical
matter
and
up
and
down
the
line,
i
would
say
this.
it
is
seems
to
me
that
the
house
is
capable
of
handling
that
problem
on
its
own.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
constitution
commits
that
problem
to
the
house
of
which
the
man
is
a
member
and
it
seems
to
us
that
the
constitution
interdicts
the
intercession
of
the
executive,
because
the
basic
situation
as
we
see
is
this.
to
rule
or
hold
otherwise
would
give
such
powerful
control
in
the
executive
to
harass,
investigate
and
generally
badger
anybody
who
makes
a
politically
unpopular
decision
and
improper
to
the
executive,
possibly
acceptable
to
the
legislative
side
and
always
you
have
in
the
political
forum,
you
have
the
concurrence
of
a
need
to
get
elected,
the
occurrence
of
campaign
funds,
the
concurrence
of
visits
from
constituents,
the
likelihood
that
a
congressman's
votes
will
indeed
represent
him
as
a
silver
block
senator,
as
a
foreign
block
senator,
as
a
fishing
block
senator,
all
having
received
campaign
contributions
from
those
particular
elements
of
their
constituents.
once
you
have
an
affirmative
vote
and
a
contribution,
we
come
then
to
the
question
of
may
you
put
that
before
a
grand
jury
and
say
now,
we
are
not
suggesting
it
to
you,
but
you
might
certainly
draw
an
inference
that
there
is
cause
and
effect.
the
threat,
the
overpowering
threat
to
the
freedom
of
the
congressman
which
is
opposed
by
that
type
of
a
rule,
would
it
seems
to
us
go
a
long
way
to
destroy
the
basic
fabric
of
our
tripartite
form
of
government.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
he
would
in
that
instance,
it
is
seems
to
me,
fall
within
the
--
the
solicitor
general,
excuse
me
sir,
described
that
the
briber
not
to
bribee
is
the
postulate
which
you
are
putting
to
me
mr.
chief
justice
as
i
understand
it.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
what
you
certainly
have
in
that
case
is
probably
the
ability
to
get
him
his
principal
first
degree,
no
matter
which
side
of
the
coin
he
is
on,
if
he
occupies
his
official
position.
though
i
am
not
sure
that
--
i
am
not
sure
that
which
side
he
is
on
would
make
much
difference
in
my
professional
judgment
as
respect
to
possible
freedom
from
or
subjection
to
discipline
or
a
trial
as
a
result
of
his
conduct
sir.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
just
for
a
moment
if
i
may
to
one
further
aspect
of
this
point
with
respect
to
the
breadth
of
a
privilege.
i
think
it
is
perfectly
clear
and
i
think
mr.
justice
brennan’s
question
to
the
solicitor
general
makes
it
clear
and
the
concession
at
page
11
of
the
government’s
brief
that
what
is
covered
by
the
speech
or
debate
clause
or
committee
report’s
resolutions
and
the
act
of
voting
“as
or
things
generally
done
in
the
session
of
the
house
by
one
of
its
members
in
relation
to
the
business
before
it”
and
i
am
taking
that
quote
directly
out
of
this
court’s
opinion
in
the
powell
case
and
it
of
course
carries
forward
a
series
of
other
decisions
which
are
antecedent,
going
all
the
way
back
to
some
of
the
landmark
decisions
in
the
early
days,
shortly
after
the
constitution
was
adopted
and
at
a
time
when
it
may
reasonably
be
thought
that
the
judges
who
were
writing
about
it
had
reason
to
know
basically
what
was
in
the
mind
of
the
framers.
insofar
as
the
1853
act
is
concerned,
we
say
this.
very
simply,
the
1853
act
could
constitute
a
perfectly
proper
exercise
of
congressional
authority
without
coming
into
conflict
of
speech
or
debate,
if
it
is
limited
in
its
impact
to
situations
where
a
senator
may
or
did
receive
moneys
in
connection
with
executive
conduct
or
conduct
relating
to
the
judiciary,
but
not
in
connection
with
legislation.
and
it
is
there,
again,
coming
back
mr.
chief
justice
to
the
question
which
you
put
to
me
sir,
it
is
there
that
we
come
back
to
say
that
is
within
the
ambit
of
the
house
of
which
he
is
a
member,
it
is
without
the
ambit
of
the
judiciary
and
the
executive.
and
looking
at
the
1853
act
and
looking
at
the
1962
revision
of
it,
we
most
respectfully
urge
that
in
each
of
those
instances,
this
can
be
given
constitutional
validity
in
its
broad
range
to
protect
against
bribery,
but
that
the
executive
and
judiciary
should
withhold
their
hands
where
they
intrude
in
to
what
might
be
called
the
basic
defensive
mechanism
given
by
the
constitution
to
the
members
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
as
a
practical
matter,
all
of
those
you
will
recall
are
in
the
house
of
senate
proceedings
and
they
were
frequently
had
called
the
task
particularly
at
about
the
time
of
civil
war.
they
were
called
to
task
for
challenging
to
duels
where
fist
to
cuts
on
the
floors
of
the
various
houses
of
congress
and
basically
i
would
say
that
that
is
not
covered
by
speech
or
debate
or
by
this
court's
interpretation
a
speech
or
debate.
now,
again
on
the
other
side
of
that,
it
is
clearly
within
the
house's
power
to
punish
unseemly
behavior
on
the
floor
of
its
legislative
hall.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
would
think
sir,
it
would
probably
in
most
instances
fall
outside
the
scope
which
i
contend
for
the
speech
or
debate
clause
as
interpreted
by
this
court
which
--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
would
think
that
it
would
sir
because
i
think
it
would
fall
outside
the
definition
of
things
ordinarily
done
in
the
session
of
the
houses
of
which
they
are
a
member.
in
other
words,
i
simply
cannot
read
bodily
assault
into
it.
now,
i
would
say
contrary
was
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
what
would
occur
would
be
that
the
house
itself
to
take
immediate
steps
and
there
will
be
a
little
need
for
the
judiciary
or
the
executive
ever
to
concern
itself
with
that
type
of
a
situation.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
have
no
doubt
this
court
within
the
due
course
find
that
that
is
perfectly
appropriate
case
of
criminal
proceeding.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
would
say
and
i
think
that
is
correct
sir
because
i
think
that
this
is
an
extreme
mean
used
to
rectify
an
error
made
which
could
otherwise
be
rectified
without
the
need
for
physical
violence
and
i
think
as
a
practical
matter
mr.
justice
brennan,
we
may
be
debating
something
which
possibly
we
do
not
even
have
to
debate
in
that
it
may
well
be
that
because
it
occurred
on
federal
property,
you
might
reasonably
be
able
to
apply
1018
to
a
murder
for
example
which
occurred
under
circumstances
mr.
justice
had
outlined,
a
general
criminal
statute,
that
this
not
being
within
the
ambient
a
speech
or
debate
hence
permissible.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
am
directing
my
attention
justice
white
to
only
speech
or
debate
as
interpreted
by
this
court
as
sufficient
to
cover
this
particular
case.
i
am
not
arguing
a
general
legislative
community
as
substance.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
well,
i
suppose
on
dombrowski
against
eastland
can
be
read
for
that.
it
was
focused
more
on
the
right
of
the
staff
members
to,
shall
we
say,
have
the
benefit
of.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
yes
sir.
there
was.
there
definitely
was.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
that
was
dombrowski
of
course
sir
--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
no,
of
course
although
--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
civil
as
distinct
from
criminal.
so
in
both
of
those
instances
you
were
talking,
i
think
we
invariably
find
in
the
opinions
mr.
justice
white,
you
invariably
find
discussions
which
tend
to
talk
in
terms
of
legislative
immunity
of
a
short
hand
form
of
referring
to
what
is
given
or
the
protection
accorded
under
given
a
set
of
circumstances
and
we
most
frequently
see
them
in
the
context
of
liable
suits
in
which
we
frequently
see
them
in
the
context.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
would
expect
so
sir.
yes.
it
may
not
be
questioned
in
any
other
place
as
i
say
it
is
not
a
word
really
which
is
one
of
the
terms
we
are
accustomed
to
and
as
the
chief
justice
said
in
lower
court
opinion
in
powell
in
connection
with
that,
it
may
not
be
questioned
has
implicit
in
it,
it
need
not
answer.
this
is
--
it
is
a
word.
it
has
more
meaning
really
than
our
standard
words
which
go
to
privilege.
it
speaks
in
terms
of
or
speech
or
debate,
he
may
not
be
questioned
in
any
other
place
and
the
historical
antecedents
of
it
very
clearly
indicate
that
they
were
talking
about
courts
in
the
older
days,
they
were
talking
about
courts
in
our
early
charter
provisions
and
our
early
state
constitutions,
that
is
exactly
what
they
had
in
mind.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
yes
sir.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
that
is
correct.
of
course
that
were
was
the
exclusion
of
the
congressman
from
the
congress,
question
of
the
liability
of
it
whether
is
in
the
house
for
their
conduct
in
that
connection
sir.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
think
it
is
a
practical
matter
mr.
justice
white,
it
has
an
even
a
broader
application
in
the
criminal
context
because
of
its
antecedents.
if
parliamentary
antecedents
with
the
fears
of
torture,
the
fears
of
commitment
to
the
power,
the
fears
of
imprisonment
which
were
used
to
dominate
the
members
of
parliament,
we
brought
that
forward
into
our
structure
as
it
came
into
our
articles
confederation
and
that
is
into
our
constitution,
largely
to
keep
the
executive
from
dominating
the
legislator.
therefore,
to
me
speech
or
debate,
the
crux
of
its
historical
antecedent
has
even
greater
application
in
the
criminal
field
because
that
was
one
of
the
major
things
which
the
framers
were
attempting
to
protect
the
legislator
against
was
intimidation
by
threat
of
grand
jury,
by
threat
of
even
a
baseless
indictment
which
been
read
a
political
being.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
think
mr.
chief
justice,
the
point
which
i
make
as
respect
to
that
is
this.
one
has
to
do
with
conduct,
physical
conduct
if
the
court
please,
the
other
has
to
do
with
attempting
to
motivate.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
well,
i
am
unclear
in
the
hypothetical
which
the
court
puts
to
me.
who
would
be
the
subject
matter
of
the
indictment,
the
man
who
made
the
threat?
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
not
the
receiver.
in
that
connection,
i
would
take
the
position
that
the
threatenor
should
be
subject
to
and
i
am
sure
it
would
be
subject
to
criminal
prosecution.
if
you
were
attempting
to
inquire
into
why
the
man
who
got
the
bribe
voted,
a
motivation
of
being
the
question
which
you
would
be
posing
in
order
to
prove
the
bribe,
i
would
think
that
you
would
have
a
interdiction
of
a
speech
or
debate
clause
as
against
inquiry
into
the
acceptor’s
motivations
sir.
now,
contrary
why
the
man
who
gives
the
bribe,
you
are
not
inquiring
into
his
motive
as
respect
they
vote.
you
are
inquiring
into
his
attempting
to
motivate
another
and
somewhere
between
those
two
explains
would
lie
the
line
of
determination
where
i
believe
this
court
would
say
no
as
to
the
recipient,
if
you
are
trying
to
prove
his
motive
and
yes
as
to
the
bribe
giver
if
you
are
attempting
to
prove
that
he
was
instituting
conduct
which
would
motivate
another.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
yes
mr.
justice
white?
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
would
say
mr.
justice
white
the
answer
to
that
has
got
to
be
in
the
basic
for
the
clause.
assume
that
the
house
may
give
up
its
prerogative
so
to
speak,
but
i
think
the
court
must
look
deeper.
the
prerogative
is
not
there
only
to
protect
that
house.
they
put
there
to
protect
the
persons
who
elected
the
members
of
that
house
as
well
as
the
members.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
there
are
some
harping
at
judge
hart's
colloquy
in
the
government's
brief,
but
judge
hart
put
a
similar
posture
in
the
colloquy
before
the
court,
the
lower
court
and
i
think
that
this
is
the
reasoning
which
the
lower
court
was
using,
if
they
cannot
do
it,
how
they
can
combine
with
another
house
which
has
no
power
over
their
members
and
give
up
this
right
which
frankly
as
bottomed
on
the
right
of
the
people's
representative
to
be
protected
in
freedom
of
speech,
freedom
of
debate
and
as
that
clause
has
been
interpreted
by
this
court
through
the
years.
thank
you.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
address
myself
first
to
the
suggestion
made
by
the
solicitor
general
in
his
closing
comments.
first,
i
would
request
to
the
court
that
attention
be
given
to
the
five
particular
subject
matter
which
is
now
asserted
by
the
solicitor
general
was
never
argued
below.
it
was
not
the
textural
aspect
of
the
case
when
it
was
before
the
district
judge.
what
was
before
the
district
judge
was
perfectly
clearly
set
forth
in
connection
with
the
debate
in
colloquy
and
in
connection
with
the
record
of
the
case
as
it
there
existed.
government
counsel
there
said
that
under
this
indictment
and
i
am
quoting
from
page
28
of
the
record
extract.
we
are
not
contending
that
what
is
being
charged
here,
that
is
the
activity
by
brewster
was
anything
other
than
a
legislative
act.
we
are
not
ducking
the
question,
it
is
squarely
presented.
they
are
legislative
acts.
we
are
not
going
to
quibble
over
that.
now,
the
important
point
to
this
case
as
we
see
it
is
this,
this
case
does
not
test
the
outer
limits
of
speech
or
debate.
this
case
falls
squarely
within
the
hard
core
of
speech
or
debate.
in
the
earlier
arguments
and
in
the
brief
that
the
government
which
is
earlier
submitted
in
this
case,
the
government
conceded
that
while
the
precise
limits
of
johnson
may
be
a
little
vague,
“we
do
not
contend
that
the
clause
for
text
only
speech.”
and
then
they
went
back
to
two
formal
holdings
of
this
court
in
the
powell
case
and
in
the
kilbourn
case,
committee
reports,
resolutions,
any
act
of
voting
are
equally
covered
as
are
“things
generally
done
in
a
session
of
the
house
by
one
of
its
members
in
relation
to
the
business
before
it.”
that
has
never
been
a
doubted
proposition.
it
was
against
the
text
of
that
and
this
court’s
clause
as
it’s
imposed
it
on
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
the
district
judge
hart
made
his
decision
against
the
background
of
that
he
plays
an
indictment
which
followed
as
the
solicitor
general
has
candidly
conceded
to
the
court
and
into
question,
official
conduct
in
the
nature
of
action,
vote
and
decision.
now
this
illusive
memorandum
of
conferences
was
known
to
trial
counsel
below
and
certainly
appellate
counsel
are
charged
with
knowledge
of
what
trial
counsel
did
know.
all
we
put
that
before
the
court
before
in
the
first
instance
was
to
make
the
court
aware
that
this
case
was
not
decided
in
a
vacuum.
that
there
was
justification
for
the
comment
by
judge
hart
“based
on
the
facts
of
this
case”
that
this
was
not
decided
in
the
abstract.
as
one
of
the
justices
--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
it
was
not
decided
in
the
abstract.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
well,
i
am
coming
to
that
sir.
as
one
of
the
justices,
mr.
chief
justice
inquired
before,
i
think
it
was
justice
stewart.
did
not
the
indictment
say
action,
vote
or
decision?
and
it
did
sir,
but
that
was
simply
clarified
and
in
that
regard,
our
position
in
that
matter
is
this,
basically
when
a
congressman
using,
of
course
that
is
general
phraseology,
when
a
congressman
is
accused
of
improper
conduct,
improper
motivation,
then
there
must
come
at
some
point
in
the
preceding
when
either
before
the
grand
jury
action
is
brought
to
stop
improper
intrusion
into
areas
covered
by
speech
or
debate
or
if
after
indictment
when
a
trial
court
has
occasion
to
have
access
to
the
precise
facts
upon
which
the
application
of
speech
or
debate
is
made
apparent.
we
say
that
that
is
what
happened
in
this
particular
case.
it
was
not
challenged
at
the
grand
jury
level
as
this
true
in
another
case
currently
pending
and
as
to
which
i
will
make
no
detailed
comment,
but
it
was
challenged
by
a
12
(b)
(1)
motion
as
soon
as
it
could
be.
that
is
to
say,
we
put
before
the
court
and
the
government
cooperated
in
putting
before
the
court
that
what
was
being
questioned
in
this
case
was
legislative
conduct,
not
the
postulated
absence
of
legislative
conduct.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
it
is,
mr.
justice
marshall,
my
answer
to
that
would
not
be
a
direct
when
it
would
be
this
sir.
you
would
be
testing
motivation
if
you
say
that
a
given
phase
of
legislative
conduct
whether
it
be
committee
discussion,
whether
it
be
a
report
written
by
a
given
congressman
was
motivated
in
one
way
or
by
one
set
of
circumstances.
you
then
fall
within
the
ambit
of
speech
or
debate.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
the
taking
of
the
bribe
is
in
the
concept
of
an
indictment
like
that
before
this
court
sir.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
oh!
no,
it’s
not.
you
are
asking
me
sir
whether
it
is
said
in
indictment
that
a
particular
speech
was
made
as
a
--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
now,
i
will
have
to
answer
that
directly
sir,
that
is
not
in
the
indictment.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
well,
i
respectfully
submit
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
no,
he
is
in
the
same
category
as
any
other
congressman
who
does
the
same
thing
that’s
subject
to
penalty
in
his
own
house,
which
has
the
right
to
question
him.
but
he
is
to
be
questioned
in
no
other
place
if
the
language
is
keen
to
debates
sir.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
if
he
does
not
make
a
speech,
then
we
are
back
to
the
inquiry
of
the
breadth
of
speech
or
debate,
are
we
strictly
talking
speech
or
debate?
and
we
say
since
kilbourn
in
1881
(voice
overlap)
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
let
me
put
it
this
way
mr.
justice
marshall
--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
no,
i
would
say,
what
was
left
opened
in
johnson,
mr.
justice
marshall
was
the
issue
of
whether
there
was
an
outer
perameter
where
this
court,
will
say
that
speech
or
debate
does
not
protect.
but
in
this
instant
case,
speech
or
debate
has
an
applicable
principle
was
conceded
before
the
lower
court.
now,
the
practical
matter,
the
issue
is
posed
in
this
fashion
in
the
lower
court.
they
say,
we
say
it
was
legislative
activity.
they
would
motivate
it
in
his
legislative
conduct
by
the
acceptance
of
improper
sums
of
money.
we
say,
and
this
is
the
trust
in
lower
court
and
also
in
the
government’s
original
brief
in
this
court,
that
this
however
falls
out
of
that
heartland
of
speech
or
debate
and
is
within
the
exclusion
which
this
court
reserved
when
johnson
was
decided.
we
say
to
the
contrary
that
on
that
issue
as
posed
before
the
lower
court
that
what
was
done
in
this
case
and
the
facts
that
alleged
in
this
case
falls
squarely
within
what
was
covered
by
johnson
and
do
not
fall
with
any
exclusion.
we
do
not
say
that
it
is
not
possible
to
postulate
a
situation
which
will
take
it
to
the
outer
limit
or
speech
or
debate
and
beyond
the
outer
limit
of
speech
or
debate,
so
that
there
may
be
an
indictable
crime.
but
as
was
said
in
the
johnson
case,
it
is
our
position
that
speech
or
debate
extends
at
least
so
far
as,
and
that
is
the
language
of
this
court
in
our
opinion.
and
we
say
it
does
clearly
extends
so
far
as
to
protect
against
inquiry
as
respects
legislative
acts
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
and
that
is
the
way
in
which
this
whole
issue
came
up.
these
assumptions,
these
hypotheses,
these
hypothetical
illustrations
were
never
part
of
the
case
when
it
was
before
judge
hart.
and
there
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
this
court
can
and
will,
on
some
occasion,
take
the
speech
or
debate
clause,
analyze
and
find
it
without
application
to
certain
sets
of
conducts
as
for
example
in
burton
and
as
in
johnson,
where
the
conduct
is
not
related
to
legislative
act
but
it
is
related
to
executive.
we
agree
that
that
is
the
fast
ruling
of
this
court
--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
suggest
sir
that
senator
burton
would
have
love
to
have
chief
justice
express
similar
opinions
back
at
the
time
of
this
case,
but
i
think
that
decided,
i
think
that
the
executive
--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
but
it
is
not
a
legislative
conduct
as
(inaudible).
the
legislative
process,
turning
as
it
does
necessarily
to
the
absorption
of
the
representative,
by
of
his
various
constituents’
wishes
and
desires
of
the
need
to
represent
them
in
connection
with
subject
matter
which
come
before
for
political
judgments
and
for
judgments
as
respect
to
policy,
he
must
be
free
and
he
is
indeed
free.
and
this
is
a
significant
aspect
and
the
significant
posture
of
a
senator
or
a
congressman
in
this
regard.
he
must
always
be
open
to
suggestion,
to
pressure.
he
must
always
be
open
to
the
possibility
that
an
executive
desiring
to
penalized
someone
who
has
voted
against
the
executive,
may
wish
to
posture
him
against
his
voting
record,
with
his
list
of
contributors,
with
an
inference
to
follow,
if
unfriendly
grand
jury
chooses
to
draw
it,
that
there
is
a
necessary
connection
between
the
assemblage
of
the
money
necessary
to
win
a
campaign
and
the
favorable
votes
be
it
on
fishing,
be
it
on
oil,
be
it
on
what
may
it
be.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
it
is
because,
if
you
please
mr.
chief
justice,
it
is
because
the
government
postured
its
case
before
the
district
judge
and
said,
we
expect
to
prove
this
case
by
proving
legislative
acts
of
senator
brewster
and
the
judge
took
their
representation
if
this
was
so,
it
became
a
concession
of
record
and
it
was
a
concession
predicated
on
known
facts,
known
to
the
judge,
known
to
counsel,
and
his
opinion
expressly
stated
based
on
that
facts
of
this
case,
so
that
it
was
not
simply
a
case
of
taking
up
hypotheticals.
the
government
had
not
postured
either
its
indictment
or
it
is
a
presentation
on
the
hypothetical
ability
to
reach
outside
and
find
some
circumstance
which
we
permit
the
drawing
of
a
claim
that
it
was
outside
speech
or
debate.
it
had
challenged
the
lower
court
by
bringing
in
any
indictment
squarely
designed
to
fall
within
speech
or
debate
as
johnson
defined
it
and
put
the
issue
to
the
district
judge
to
say
that
this
was
a
narrowly
drawn
statute.
that’s
exactly
the
way
they
attend
to
the
posture
it,
sir.
now
under
those
circumstances,
it
was
clean
and
clear
that
they
post
the
issue
to
the
trial
court,
are
you
now
willing
to
say
that
if
we
take
a
statute
which
we
deemed
to
be
a
precise
narrowly
drawn
statute
that
you
will
say
that
speech
or
debate
must
surrender
to
it.
and
that
was
the
way
it
was
before
the
court
and
the
facts
were
before
the
court
at
what
was
being
challenged
with
legislative
conduct
of
the
senator.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
yes,
sir.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
do
not
believe
that
that
is
a
necessary
corollary.
i
think,
by
the
reservation
which
was
made
by
the
court
in
johnson,
it
was
indicated
that
there
might
be
an
area
where
such
a
bribe
could
be
penalized.
we
argue
as
you
are
aware
sir,
in
our
brief,
that
it
being
a
power
granted
to
each
of
the
houses,
to
inquire
into
motivation
of
members
and
not
granted
to
the
houses
as
houses
of
congress
to
legislate
on
generally,
that
they
cannot
take
away
the
power
which
the
people
gave
or
the
protection
that
people
gave
their
representative.
but
coming
pass
that
point,
i
would
say
sir
that,
in
for
example,
the
bribed
congressman’s
immunity
from
prosecution
which
is
common
in
all
private
law
review
fights
extensively
and
is
one
the
leading
works
dealing
with
the
subject
matter.
now,
the
suggestion
made
that
a
properly
drawn
statute
might
be
structured
which
could
permit
it.
we
are
somewhat
ambivalent
on
that,
since
we
argue
that
there
is
no
constitutional
power
to
delegate
that
right,
the
section
5
right,
over
to
the
courts
for
inquiry.
but
basically
i
would
say,
yes
there
may
be
a
chance,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
where
it
could
be
done.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
well,
as
a
practical
matter,
i
would
think
that
some
of
the
--
in
the
first
argument
in
this
case
we
have
a
series
of
hypothetical
questions
to
counsel
for
the
appellee
and
it
was
an
attempt
really
to
move
away
from
the
heartland
of
speech
or
debate,
and
outward.
mr.
justice
marshall
poses
a
somewhat
similar
problem.
are
we
at
the
outer
limits
of
speech
or
debate,
where
a
bribe
is
a
accepted
and
agreed
to
where
there
is
no
need
to
introduce
any
evidence
concerning
official
action
taken,
any
official
vote
given,
any
official
resolution
granted,
any
official
speech
given,
are
we
going
to
reach
the
point
where
that
the
court
will
now
say,
you
are
sufficiently
away
from
inquiry
and
the
legislative
acts
that
we
should
sustain
the
prosecution?
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
well,
i
would
say
that,
i
understood
your
question
to
be
sir,
if
i
could
postulate
a
circumstance.
i
am
not
saying
that
it
is
only
circumstance.
i
would
suggest
this
to
you
sir,
that
if
the
indictment
was
premised
on
a
set
of
facts
which
would
permit
proof,
that
a
given
man
had
agreed
to
take
a
given
bribe
and
then
he
did
nothing
that
you
might
possibly
be
able
to
sustain
the
indictment
because
the
agreement
itself
constituted
the
bribe.
but,
where
you
have,
on
the
other
end
of
the
edge
line,
that
is
to
say
that
he
was
alleged
to
have
taking
a
bribe
to
be
motivated
to
vote
for
and
did
vote
for,
then
you
open
up
inquiry
and
to
the
very
area
of
his
conduct
which
is
proscribed
by
speech
or
debate.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
well,
this
is
why
the
outer
limits
of
the
problem
as
i
say.
we
focus
our
attention
on
them
as
wholly
by
virtue
of
hypotheticals
from
various
justices
of
the
last
hearing.
we
think
that
focuses
on
the
wrong
issue
in
the
case
that
is
not
this
case
as
we
can
see.
this
case
is
differently
postured.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
quite
agree
that
the
court
is
correct
in
trying
to
test
the
outer
reach
of
any
decision
which
it
makes.
but
i
remind
you
sir
that
this
case
is
before
the
court
under
the
criminal
appeals
act
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
that
there
is
something
in
the
record
of
this.
\not
in
the
indictment
sir.
i
have
never
been
in
that
provision.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
am
sorry
sir?
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
no,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
indictment
is
all
we
have
mr.
justice
marshall
that
has
been
our
point.
the
indictment
clearly
does
cover
action,
vote,
and
decision.
in
other
words,
the
indictment
says--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
the
indictment
covers
his
action
(voice
overlap)
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
you
postulated
the
same
hypothetical
to
me
at
the
last
theory
and
again
i
would
have
to
give
you,
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
same
answer
which
i
gave.
it
depends
on
whether
this
indictment
which
is
challenged
and
which
is
before
the
court
would
require
proof
as
respects
to
his
legislative
conduct
thereafter.
if
that
be
so,
then
we
say
(voice
overlap)
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
do
not,
sir,
read
johnson
if,
mr.
justice,
you
are
stating
out
as
a
whole
in
johnson.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
no,
i
do
not
believe
sir
that
is
what
was
left
open
in
johnson.
what
was
left
open
in
johnson
was,
as
this
court
put
in
an
opinion,
“we
live
for
another
day.”
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
he
is
being
charged
with,
under
this
indictment?
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
in
this
case
sir,
he
is
being
charged
with
bribery
and
with
aiding
or
abetting.
it
is
under
182
which
is
the
aid
or
abet
provision
under
201
(c)
or
(g).
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
201
(c),
sir.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
the
government
alleges,
in
this
indictment,
that
--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
would
suggest,
sir
that
the
government
must
necessarily
prove
that
it
was
to
influence
him
in
the
performance
of
an
official
act.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
that
is
correct
and
that
is
the
allegation.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
and
that
act
would
say
--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
am
suggesting
to
you
sir
that
what
was
done
in
this
case
was
that
the
legislative
conduct
has
alleged
in
his
action,
vote
and
decision,
or
what
they
intended
to
prove
and
that
is
the
very
area
of
inquiry
which
is
foreclosed
by
speech
or
debate.
now,
i
am
not
suggesting
that
the
way
that
is
foreclosed
by
speech
or
debate
is
the
conversation
having
to
do
with
whether
or
not
a
bribe
would
or
would
not
be
paid.
i
am
saying
that
government
said,
in
this
case,
we
intend
to
show
the
receipt
of
campaign
contributions
because
the
first
in
count,
which
the
solicitor
general
selected
as
typical,
and
which
i
will
use
as
typical
if
the
court
will
keep
in
mind
that
count
nine
has
a
slight
variant
and
it
refers
backward
to
the
receipt
of
moneys
there
for
as
distinct
or
action
taken
there
for
to
as
distinct
from
anticipated
action.
it
is
alleged
in
this
indictment
that
the
defendant
sought,
accepted,
received
and
agreed
to
received
the
sum
of
$5,000.00
for
himself
and
for
an
entity
the
dc
committee
for
maryland
education.
a
political
fund
in
other
words,
it
is
what
is
alleged
to
be
involved.
then
we
go
on
to
say
and
we
intend
to
show
that
this
was
in
return
for
being
influenced
in
the
performance
of
his
official
act.
in
respect
to
his
action,
vote
and
decision
and
it
was
to
that
subject
matter
that
assistant
united
states
attorney
addressed
himself,
when
asked
by
the
court
as
to
whether
the
act
which
were
challenged
were
legislative
in
nature
and
he
said,
"yes
sir,
they
are,"
and
that
was
in
accord
with
the
understanding
of
everybody
concerned,
that
there
were
legislative
acts.
and
that
being
the
case,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
this
was
an
attempt
to
precisely
stage
this
case
for
that
decision.
it
was
so
decided
and
not
all
square
in
johnson.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
well,
i
suspect
sir
that
very
many
times
the
great
confident
trial
judges
aren’t
perfectly
willing
and
indeed
need
to
rely
on
an
open
concession
such
as
was
made
by
the
assistant
of
united
states
attorney
in
this
case
that
it
was
legislative
conduct
which
was
challenged.
and
that
against
the
background
of
a
fully
known
revelation
to
the
trial
judge
of
precisely
what
factual
data
that
government
intended
to
prove
which
they
supplied
as
they
say
is
pre-handed
fashion
to
the
defendant
but
did
not
put
into
the
record
because
of
the
very
good
chance
of
pretrial,
prejudicial
publicity
in
a
case
for
trial
then
pending
shortly
after
the
hearing
date
of
the
motions
which
were
then
before
the
court.
and
it
was,
as
i
suggest
to
the
court,
a
perfectly
useful,
desirable,
and
necessary
proposition
that
courts
proceed
on
this
particularly
areas
whereas
the
court
said
in
powell.
the
congressman
should
be
relieved
of
the
obligation
to
defend
himself.
there
is,
under
the
decision
of
this
court,
no
constitutional
basis
for
making
a
crime
out
of
conduct
where
you
must
necessarily
go
to
motivation
for
legislative
conduct
in
order
to
prove
that
a
given
sum
of
money
was
received
or
had
by
a
particular
man
in
question
by
reason
of
a
specific
motivation
on
his
part.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
order
to
put
our
position
in
this
case
in
proper
context,
i
think
i
return
to
the
basic
principle
from
which
we
rely
may
be
help.
first
of
all,
we
premise
our
argument
on
the
announced
concept
as
laid
down
by
this
court,
that
one
of
the
functions
of
speech
and
debate
clause
is
to
relieve
the
senator
of
a
duty
of
expanding
itself.
that
is
announced
in
several
of
the
recent
expositions
as
respect
to
meaning
of
speech
or
debate.
we
further
would
state
to
the
court
that
this
imposes
a
duty
on
a
trial
of
such
cases
or
one
before
in
such
case
comes
to
inquire
into
the
case
which
is
intended
to
be
made
by
the
prosecutor
against
the
defendant
on
the
particular
facts
of
that
case.
now
keep
in
mind,
if
you
will
please
that
our
opposition
is
that
if
there
is
an
interrogation
which
is
violative
of
speech
or
debate,
and
an
indictment
has
already
been
returned
or
has
been
at
least
one
violation
of
speech
or
debate
in
the
very
inquiry
which
was
the
underlying,
critical
for
the
indictment
which
is
returned.
therefore,
the
rules
of
the
district
judge
before
such
a
case
comes,
to
look
to
the
facts
of
the
case,
to
look
to
the
indictment,
and
to
see
whether
what
has
been
done,
is
a
set
of
circumstances
which
leads
to
application
of
speech
or
debate
and
which
are
properly
to
cause
him
to
enter
into
the
case
for
the
purpose
of
dismissing
it
because
he
has
an
obligation
to
honor
the
senator’s
right,
not
to
be
called
upon
to
defend,
if
the
case
is
violative
of
speech
or
debate.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
yes
,sir.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
as
a
practical
matter,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
way
we
see
it
and
what
we
premise
our
argument
on
is
a
direct
quote
out
of
the
johnson
case
and
in
that
case
this
court
said,
"speaking
thereof
conspiring
to
give
a
speech
in
return
for
a
compensation
from
private
sources."
however
reprehensible,
we
believe
that
the
speech
or
debate
clause
extends
at
least
so
far
as
to
prevent
it
from
being
made
the
basis
of
a
criminal
charge.
speaking
backward
through
the
quality
of
that
as
it
sufficiently
indictable
basis.
and
i
think
the
policy
considerations
sir,
which
is
behind
that
is
simply
this,
the
clause
is
designed
to
prevent
harassment
of
the
legislator
by
either
an
unfriendly
executive
or
by
an
unfriendly
judiciary
if
that
be
the
case.
but
in
the
first
instance,
the
grand
jury
investigation.
it
is
to
shield
him
from
being
hailed
in
before
the
grand
jury,
queried
as
respects
to
his
motives.
now,
if
i
may
postulate
a
case
which
is
illustrative,
i
think
it
would
run
this
way,
if
the
court
does
not
vindicate
speech
or
debate
as
stopping
grand
jury
inquiry,
is
it
not
perfectly
possible
for
an
unfriendly
prosecutor
to
hail
in
any
member
of
the
congress,
put
before
that
grand
jury
a
list
of
the
contributors
who
contributed
to
his
last
campaign
and
within
the
frame
or
reference
to
the
bribery
statute,
then
put
against
that
testimony
that
a
given
senator
and/or
congressman
voted,
in
a
particular
way,
favorable
to
the
very
interest
who
had
contributed
so
heavily
to
his
campaign
funding
at
the
time
when
he
ran?
now,
from
that,
it
would
be
postulated
that
you
may
draw
the
inference
that
the
vote
favorable
to
whatever
interest
it
may
be,
could
be
said
to
be
or
an
inference
could
be
drawn
that
it
was
predicated
upon
the
earlier
contribution
of
money
to
his
campaign.
it
is
this
peculiar
aspect
of
the
elective
process
the
need
of
the
representative
to
get
himself
elected
which
sets
apart
the
legislative
from
all
the
balance
of
government
with
the
exception
of,
of
course
the
president
and
vice
president
who
are
in
a
position
where
they
necessarily
are
participants
in
political
campaigns
in
order
to
become
elected
representatives
of
the
people.
but
basically,
we
think
the
policy
is
cleanly
stated
and
we
think
the
policy
a
wise
one
in
that,
the
essence
of
the
charge
again
is
this
court
said
in
johnson,
and
speaking
there
to
the
johnson
charge,
in
this
context,
is
that
the
congressman’s
conduct
was
improperly
motivated
and
as
well
appear
that
is
precisely
what
the
speech
or
debate
clause
generally
forecloses
from
executive
and
judicial
inquiry.
now,
coming
back
to
my
original
view
of
the
matter,
i
would
say,
sir,
that
we
approached
it
this
way,
the
court
owes
an
obligation
because
of
the
prayer,
the
court
i
am
talking
now
the
court
hearing
such
a
case,
owes
was
an
obligation
to
examine
the
facts.
in
this
case,
it
was
conceded
by
the
government
and
found
by
the
court
that
a
necessary
root
of
the
case
was
inquiry
into
legislative
conduct.
and
it
was
at
that
stage
that
judge
hart
granted
the
motion.
now,
the
price
of
the
prosecution
to
this
sort
is,
that
it
would
seek
to
have
a
finder
of
fact,
usually
a
jury
but
not
necessary
so,
to
draw
inferences
between
the
campaign
funds
on
the
one
hand
and
positions
taken
politically.
judgment
calls
by
a
man
who
makes
policy,
by
a
man
who
does
indeed
address
himself
to
consideration
which
are
based
upon
the
well
being
of
those
whom
he
represents.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
well,
i
would
say
sir
that
while
you
are
corrected,
of
course
mr.
chief
justice,
that
they
were
in
a
case
which
dealt
with
that
subject
matter.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
think,
i
purported
[voice
overlap]
your
honor,
i
may
have
been
paraphrasing,
but
however
reprehensible
and
i
had
interspersed
conspiring
to
give
a
speech
in
return
for
payment
by
private
individuals.
maybe
we
believe
the
speech
or
debate
clause
extends
at
least
so
far,
that
was
of
course
in
the
aspect
of
the
case
where
they
were
discussing
a
speech
which
was
given
by
congressman
johnson.
and
i
believe
that
was
the
court’s
inquiry
to
me
and
the
answer
is
yes
sir
that
is
correct.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
well,
i
think
mr.
chief
justice,
this
court
sent
the
case
back
and
said
that
if
he
could
be
purged
of
elements
offensive
to
speech
or
debate,
there
was
no
reason
why
that
could
not
be
a
proceeding
which
would
go
to
the
other
aspects
of
the
case.
but
the
speech
was
so
thoroughly
intertwined
into
the
governmental
evidence
in
the
original
case.
it
was
impossible
to
sort
it
out
at
that
point
and
simply
went
back
in
the
trials.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
on
such
substantive
accounts
which
in
no
way
involve
the
speech
and
which
frankly
spoke
only
to
those
aspects
of
the
matter
which
had
to
do
with
his
having
interceded
in
connection
with
executive
affairs
as
distinct
from
performing
legislative
function.
thank
you
very
much.
