the

came
here
after

conviction?
justice

on
a

transcript
for
the

justice

stewart
when
was
this
statute
at
the

i
did
not
--
justice

stewart
in
1962.
justice
potter
stewart
defend
himself
from
what?
justice
potter
stewart
or
any
speech
or
a
debate?
justice
potter
stewart
but
now
let
us
assume
that
the
defendant
in
this
case
never
made
a
speech,
never
engaged
in
debate,
never
cast
a
vote
in
committee
or
on
the
floor,
but
nonetheless
took
a
bribe
in
return
for
his
promise
to
do
one
of
those
things,
but
either
he
had
never
got
around
to
it
or
he
broke
his
promise,
then
what
would
the
posture
of
the
case
to
be?
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
the
bribe?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
my
--
in
my
hypothetical
case
there
was
no
vote.
he
took
a
bribe
in
return
for
his
promise
to
vote
in
a
certain
way
or
make
a
certain
speech,
but
either
he
broke
his
promise
or
else
he
never
got
around
to
it
before
he
was
indicted
then
what
role,
if
any,
would
the
speech
or
debate
clause
have?
justice
potter
stewart
questioned
for
what
in
any
other
place?
he
is
now
just
simply
being
charged
with
talking
a
bribe?
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
has
never
done
anything
in
the
house
or
in
the
senate?
justice
potter
stewart
in
response
to
the
bribe?
justice
potter
stewart
it
does
not
say
so,
does
it
not,
constitutional
clause
simply
does
not
say
so?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
case
interpreted
in
way
to
support
your
answer
to
my
question?
justice
potter
stewart
motive
for
doing
what?
making
a
speech
or
a
debate
or
vote?
here
under
my
question
there
was
no
speech,
there
was
no
debate
and
there
was
no
vote.
it
was
merely
the
taking
of
bribe.
justice
potter
stewart
in
return
for
the
promise
to
vote
in
a
certain
way,
is
there
an
allegation
that
there
was
any
such
vote
in
the
indictment?
justice
potter
stewart
in
all
of
the
counts?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
seems
to
me
that
at
least
some
of
the
counts
of
this
indictment
pretty
well
fit
under
my
hypothetical
case?
justice
potter
stewart
what
he
has
talked
about
in
the
indictment
is
taking
a
bribe,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
then
if
he
stayed
away,
if
in
inquiry
into
he
is
staying
away.
justice
potter
