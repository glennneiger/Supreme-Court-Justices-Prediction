even

justice

so
you
are
just
not
arguing
it?
justice
byron

i
take
it
to
your
position
is
that
immunity
of
congressman
and
senators
is
defined
by
the
speech
or
debate
clause
and
there
is
no
separate
doctrine
aside
from
that
of
legislative
immunity?
justice
byron

would
you
read
the
dombrowski
against
eastland
as
suggesting
that
there
is
a
doctrine
of
legislative
immunity
aside
from
the
speech
or
debate
clause?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
there
was
a
question
of
the
immunity
of
the
senator?
justice
byron
r.
white
generally
speaking,
the
doctrine
of
legislate
immunity
is
one
that
is
applicable
to
immunize
a
defendant
in
a
civil
action,
is
it
not
that
correct?
justice
byron

white
(voice

it
is
not
generally
been

to
be
a
doctrine
applicable

justice

did

well,
let
us
take
the

as
any.

at

that
picked

you
said.

the

arose
in
that
case,
the
context
of
the
claim
against

in
the
civil

justice
byron

you
think
the

should

mr.

justice
byron

let
us
assume
there
an

involved
in

takes

the

then
by
the

house
involved
by
resolution

waive

right

the

well,
the
