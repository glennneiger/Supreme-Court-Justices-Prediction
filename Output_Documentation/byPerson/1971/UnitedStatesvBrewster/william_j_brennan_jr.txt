justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
suggesting
solicitor
general
that
if
the
form
of
statute
we
have
here
had
been
the
form
of
statute
involved
in
the
johnson
case,
it
was
open
in
the
other
way?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
we
have
had
a
provision
of
this
very
statute
that
we
dealing
with
now,
another
section
which
had
said
it
was
a
criminal
offense
to
accept
a
bribe
from
making
a
speech
on
the
floor
of
the
house.
oh!
that
were
the
(voice
overlap)
that
we
have
dealt
with.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
have
to
be
clear
about
this
mr.
solicitor.
you
are
not
however
contending
that
the
speech
and
debate
clause
protects
only
speech,
are
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
what
is
troubling
me
of
course
is
what
is
in
your
footnote
at
the
bottom
of
page
11,
where
you
say
whatever
the
precise
limits
of
johnson,
we
do
not
contend
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
the
clause
protects
only
speech?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
argument
mr.
ramsey
is
this
was
really
summary
judgment
not
dismissed
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
is
that
memorandum,
is
not
part
of
record
before
us?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
had
never
seen
it
in
the
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
how
are
we
to
treat
this
summary
judgment,
if
we
do
not
have
a
basis
upon
which
you
make
that
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
understand
you
mr.
ramsey,
your
position
is
that
the
speech
and
debate
clause
go
so
far
as
to
preclude
except
in
the
house
of
which
he
is
a
member,
any
kind
of
discipline
against
a
senator
or
a
congressman
where
one
official,
but
is
done
as
in
connection
with
the
--
his
function
as
a
senator
or
congressman,
do
you
go
that
far?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
why
that
--
when
i
said,
it
was
connected
with
his
official
responsibilities.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
and
you
say
that
the
only
discipline
to
which
he
maybe
subject
is
any
that
maybe
imposed
by
his
own
house,
which
would
take
what
form?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
--
what
the
house
of
senate
might
do
in
disciplining
a
member
is
nothing
that
the
congress
may
say
shall
be
turned
over
to
the
courts
to
do
for
them?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
ramsey,
is
there
is
anything
in
the
framer's
consideration
of
the
speech
and
debate
clause
that
supports
that
position?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
you
can
get
that
whether
there
were
any
--
any
minutes,
any
kind
of
records
of
what
it
was
the
framers
recorded
as
what
they
had
in
mind,
when
they
adopted
the
speech
and
debate
clause,
not
in
its
present
form?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
at
least
we
have
a
history
i
gather
that
goes
back
to
1853
of
congress
enacting
this
form
of
statute,
that
relate
to
the
conduct
of
a
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
but
as
i
recall
it,
justice
harlan’s
opinion
for
the
court
did
reserve
this
very
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
that
suggests
that
maybe
johnson
did
not
answer
this
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
ordinarily
we
would
reserve
this
question.
i
think
you
try
to
get
over
the
message
that
they
we
are
not
deciding
that
question
in
the
(voice
overlap).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let
us
say
then
mr.
ramsey
that
if
there
were
a
statute
in
which
punishing
assault
by
one
congressman
upon
another
and
provided
that
the
punishment
should
be
by
the
judiciary
in
the
form
of
a
prosecution,
you
would
say
that
that
would
be
constitutional?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
would
take
rather
outlandish
hypothetical.
one
wanted
to
vote
a
congressman,
a
senator
wanted
to
vote
in
a
certain
way
and
for
some
reason
or
the
other
(inaudible)
a
fellow
senator
who
was
on
(inaudible).
is
the
recording
of
that
(inaudible)
his
announcement
of
it,
so
he
got
a
gun
and
shot
the
senator
standing
in
his
way.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
was
not
the
--
you
know
what
was
involved,
there
was
an
attempted
interference
with
his
vote,
you
would
say
that
would
not
cover
those
people?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
suggesting
solicitor
general
that
if
the
form
of
statute
we
have
here
had
been
the

of

in
the

case,
it
was

oh!
that
were
the
(voice

that
we
have
dealt
with.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
have
to
be
clear
about
this
mr.
solicitor.
you
are
not
however
contending
that
the
speech
and
debate
clause
protects
only
speech,
are
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
what
is
troubling
me
of
course
is
what
is
in
your
footnote
at
the
bottom
of

11,
where
you

that

your

mr.
ramsey
is
this

i

but
how
are
we
to
treat
this
summary
judgment,
if
we
do
not

upon
which
you
make
that
argument?

that
is
why
that
--
when
i
said,
it
was
connected
with
his
official
responsibilities.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
and
you
say
that
the
only
discipline
to
which
he
maybe

is
any
that
maybe
imposed
by
his
own
house,
which
would
take

justice
william

what

what
the

is
nothing
that
