mr.
erwin
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
direct
appeal
from
a
decision
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
which
has
held
that
an
act
of
congress,
generally
applicable
throughout
the
united
states
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
the
offense
charged
in
the
criminal
indictment
before
it.
the
offense,
to
put
it
simply,
is
bribery
and
the
defendant
against
whom
the
charge
is
made
was
a
united
states
senator
at
the
time
charged
is
now
a
former
united
states
senator.
the
facts
are
simple.
there
is
virtually
nothing
before
the
court
except
the
indictment,
found
by
the
grand
jury
and
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment
which
was
granted.
the
indictment
contains
a
number
of
counts.
the
odd
numbered
counts
relate
to
the
defendant,
the
alleged
bribee.
the
even
number
counts
relate
to
the
parties
who
are
charged
with
having
offered
or
given
the
bribe,
or
the
briber.
and
the
underlying
facts
appear
on
page
1
of
the
appendix
in
the
--
as
alleged
in
the
indictment,
that
at
all
times,
daniel
brewster
was
a
public
official
of
the
united
states,
a
member
of
the
senate
of
the
united
states
from
the
state
of
maryland.
and
then
the
gist
of
the
charge
appears
on
page
2
of
the
appendix
with
respect
to
count
1
and
i
repeat,
the
odd
numbered
count
relates
to
senator
brewster
and
are
all
essentially
the
same
as
far
as
the
issue
now
before
the
court
is
concerned
and
the
charge
is
that
he
corruptly
asked,
solicited,
sought,
accepted,
received
and
agreed
to
receive
the
sum
of
$5,000.00
for
himself
and
for
an
entity,
that
is
the
dc
committee
from
maryland
education,
from
cyrus
t
anderson
and
spiegel
inc.
in
return
for
being
influenced
in
his
performance
of
official
acts
in
respect
of
his
action,
vote
and
decision
on
postage
rate
legislation
which
might
at
any
time
be
pending
before
him
in
his
official
capacity.
now,
the
motion
which
was
filed
on
behalf
of
the
defendant
appears
on
page
8
of
the
appendix.
there
is
also
another
motion
on
page
9
which
relates
to
vagueness
and
things
to
that
sort
which
was
not
dealt
with
in
any
way
by
the
district
court
and
an
appeal
under
the
criminal
appeals
act
brings
to
this
court
only
the
issue
which
was
dealt
with,
excuse
me,
this
is
not
the
criminal
appeals
act,
this
is
the
act
allowing
direct
appeals
in
cases
where
an
act
to
congress
has
been
held
unconstitutional
and
such
an
appeal
brings
here
only
the
issue
which
was
decided
below.
and
the
motion
to
dismiss
on
page
8
of
the
appendix,
the
defendant
moves
to
dismiss
the
odd
numbered
counts
and
ground
is
that
counts
1,
3,
5,
and
7
of
the
indictment
charged
this
defendant
with
violations
of
18
u.s.c.
201
(c)
(1)
and
in
each
such
count
this
defendant
is
charged
with
being
influenced
in
his
performance
of
official
acts
in
his
capacity
as
a
united
states
senator.
and
there
is
of
course
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
that
is
what
the
indictment
charge
is,
that
he
was
influenced
in
his
official
acts,
in
his
capacity
as
a
united
states
senator.
now,
the
question
of
jurisdiction
of
this
court
was
postponed
until
the
hearing
on
the
merits
and
here
i
find
i
have
made
a
mistake.
this
is
an
appeal
under
the
criminal
appeals
act.
it
might
possibly
have
been
brought
under
the
other
statutes,
but
it
is
an
appeal
under
the
criminal
appeals
act.
the
statute
involved
is
the
former
form
of
section
3731
of
title
xviii
and
known
as
the
criminal
appeals
act.
the
amendment
to
this
provision
which
was
enacted
last
january
is
not
applicable
since
the
case
was
began
by
indictment
on
december
1,
1969,
more
than
a
year
before
the
enactment
of
the
amendment.
the
relevant
provisions
of
the
criminal
appeals
act
are
quoted
on
page
5
of
the
appellee’s
motion
to
dismiss
or
affirm
and
on
page
9
of
the
appellee’s
brief
and
to
refresh
the
court’s
recollection,
i
will
read
the
two
provisions
involved
which
are
at
least
verbally,
relevantly,
relatively
simple.
appeal
lies
to
this
court
under
that
statute
from
a
decision
or
judgment
setting
aside
or
dismissing
any
indictment
or
information
on
any
count
thereof
where
such
decision
or
judgment
is
based
upon
the
invalidity
or
construction
of
the
statute
upon
which
the
indictment
or
information
is
founded.
and
the
other
statute
relating
to
appeals
on
acts
that
--
decisions
holding
act
of
congress
unconstitutional
is
not
applicable
because
it
applies
only
to
civil
cases.
and
this
is
a
criminal
case
and
the
second
head
of
jurisdiction
under
the
old
criminal
appeals
act
is
from
the
decision
or
judgment
sustaining
a
motion
in
bar
when
the
defendant
has
not
been
put
in
jeopardy.
and
we
contend
that
there
is
jurisdiction
under
this
case
under
either
or
both
of
those
two
provisions
of
the
former
criminal
appeals
act.
in
the
first
place,
it
is
entirely
clear
that
the
defendant
has
not
been
put
in
jeopardy.
no
jury
was
empaneled
nor
was
the
case
in
any
way
submitted
to
the
judge
as
a
trier
of
the
facts
with
the
judge
sitting
in
place
of
a
jury.
there
was
simply
the
indictment
and
the
motion
to
dismiss,
the
traditional
way
to
raise
a
legal
question
with
respect
to
a
criminal
indictment
and
thus
the
case
comes
within
the
language
of
justice
harlan
in
the
sisson
case,
where
in
distinguishing
this
court’s
decision
in
united
states
against
covington.
justice
harlan
noted
that
the
dismissal
in
covington
was
“before
trial
without
any
evidentiary
hearing”
and
that
is
printed
in
the
italics
in
the
report
itself.
that
of
course
is
exactly
the
situation
here.
this
was
before
trial
and
without
any
evidentiary
hearing.
and
similarly
the
situation
comes
clearly
within
the
language
used
in
the
court’s
opinion
in
the
jorn
case
last
term
where
it
was
said
that
in
enacting
the
criminal
appeals
act,
congress
wished
“to
avoid
subjecting
the
defendant
to
a
second
trial,
where
the
first
had
terminated
in
a
manner
favorable
to
the
defendant
either
because
of
a
jury
verdict
or
because
of
judicial
action.”
here
there
has
never
been
a
first
trial.
there
has
been
a
motion
to
dismiss
entirely
on
the
face
of
the
pleadings.
there
has
been
a
decision
on
that
motion
to
dismiss,
but
that
is
not
in
the
sense
of
the
criminal
appeals
act
or
the
sense
of
double
jeopardy,
a
trial.
in
this
case
there
was
no
stipulation
of
facts
of
any
sort.
there
was
nothing
that
could
even
be
regarded
as
a
bill
of
particulars
or
anything
like
that.
there
were
no
concessions
by
the
government
of
any
sort,
nor
any
factual
assertions
by
the
government
beyond
what
is
stated
in
the
indictment.
the
entire
proceedings
before
judge
hart
are
printed
in
the
appendix.
i
believe
that
what
i
have
said
with
respect
to
them
is
fully
supported
by
the
record.
there
is
nothing
in
it
to
support
a
contention
that
judge
hart
made
any
sort
of
a
factual
determination
or
adjudication.
what
he
decided
is
that
on
the
facts
alleged
in
the
indictment,
the
statute
cannot
be
constitutionally
applied.
and
mr.
ramsey
quite
properly
points
to
language
which
was
used
by
judge
hart
in
expressing
his
opinion
and
this
appears
on
page
33
of
the
appendix.
and
judge
hart
did
say
right
at
the
middle
of
the
page,
gentlemen,
“based
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
which
sounds
bad
from
my
point
of
view,
it
is
admitted
by
the
government,
which
sounds
bad
from
my
point
of
view,
that
the
five
counts
of
the
indictment
which
charged
senator
brewster
relate
to
the
acceptance
of
bribes
in
connection
with
performance
of
a
legislative
function
by
a
senator
of
the
united
states.”
but
from
an
examination
of
the
transcript,
it
is
readily
apparent
that
the
facts
to
which
judge
hart
was
referring
were
those
stated
in
the
indictment
not
anything
that
was
conceded
by
the
government
or
asserted
by
the
government
or
offered
by
way
of
affidavit,
deposition
in
any
other
way
in
terms
of
facts,
above
and
beyond
the
effects
alleged
in
the
indictment.
and
it
is
also
clear
that
nothing
was
admitted
in
a
factual
sense
by
counsel,
by
--
for
the
government,
before
judge
hart.
insofar
as
counsel
admitted
anything
there,
it
was
that
the
facts
charged
in
the
indictment
are
those
which
are
--
they
are
alleged,
namely
that
the
defendant
was
at
all
relevant
times
a
united
states
senator
and
that
he
is
charged
with
seeking
and
receiving
a
bribe
under
the
circumstances
stated
in
the
indictment.
thus
there
is
clearly
a
case
in
which
the
court
below
has
held
that
an
act
of
congress
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
the
facts
alleged
in
this
indictment.
this
seems
to
come
squarely
within
this
court’s
decision
in
the
knox
case
in
396
u.s.which
upheld
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
under
the
criminal
appeals
act,
where
the
statute
has
been
held
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
the
facts
alleged
in
the
indictment,
although
not
generally
unconstitutional.
it
is
also
our
view
that
there
is
jurisdiction
under
the
other
clause
of
section
3731,
the
one
relating
to
a
motion
in
bar.
we
contend
that
the
assertion
made
in
the
motion
to
dismiss
in
this
case,
namely
that,
this
defendant
is
charged
with
being
influenced
in
his
performance
of
official
acts
in
his
capacity
as
a
united
sated
senator
and
that
the
indictment
for
this
reason
violates
the
provision
of
article
1,
section
6
of
the
united
states
constitution
is
a
motion
in
bar.
sometimes
a
motion
in
bar
is
referred
to
as
a
confession
in
avoidance
and
mr.
ramsey
says
that
the
defendant
has
not
confessed.
i
think
though
that
the
problem
comes
from
too
broader
use
of
the
word
confession.
when
a
person
raises
the
statute
on
limitations
or
a
pardon,
this
is
clearly
within
the
motion
in
bar
provision,
yet
in
such
a
case
the
defendant
need
not
to
confess.
he
says
in
the
effect,
whether
i
did
it
or
not
or
even
if
i
did
do
it,
you
cannot
prosecute
me
because
of
the
statute
of
limitations
or
the
pardon
as
the
case
may
be.
and
this
is
exactly
what
senator
brewster’s
counsel
have
said
here,
whether
i
did
it
or
not
or
even
if
i
did
do
it,
you
cannot
prosecute
me
because
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
this
seems
to
me
to
be
what
is
meant
by
motion
in
bar
as
used
in
this
statute
or
by
the
term
special
plea
in
bar,
which
was
used
in
its
original
form.
it
is
for
example
the
kind
of
motion
that
would
have
been
made
by
a
member
of
the
house
of
commons
in
the
18th
century.
if
there
were
a
charge
against
him
which
he
cannot
allege,
he
came
within
parliamentary
privilege.
what
the
defendant
is
saying
is
that
even
if
i
admitted
all
of
the
facts,
i
have
a
special
defense
that
i
suggest
is
a
motion
in
bar
and
brings
this
case
within
the
jurisdictional
statute.
now,
let
me
turn
to
the
merits
of
the
case
which
is
of
course
a
natural
sequel
to
the
court’s
decision
in
the
johnson
case
in
383
u.s.
decided
little
over
five
years
ago.
understandably
enough,
the
appellee
relies
on
the
johnson
decision
and
it
is
incumbent
on
me
to
show
that
the
facts
there
make
that
case
distinguishable
from
those
which
are
alleged
in
this
indictment
and
i
repeat
we
have
nothing
here
except
the
facts
alleged
in
the
indictment.
it
is
perfectly
possible,
it
seems
to
me
for
this
trial
to
be
conducted
under
this
indictment
in
a
way
which
might
infringe
the
johnson
case
and
if
that
were
done,
there
would
be
another
issue,
but
that
is
not
the
problem
here.
the
problem
here
is
whether
the
trial
can
be
conducted
in
such
a
way
as
not
to
infringe
the
johnson
case
and
i
submit
that
it
can.
mr.
erwin
griswold
the
johnson
case
came
here
after
a
verdict
of
guilty
by
a
jury
in
a
full
trial.
mr.
erwin
griswold
full
transcript
of
the
evidence
and
reversal
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
that
reversal
was
upheld
by
this
court
and
indeed
with
the
benefit
of
hindsight,
it
seems
apparent
that
the
johnson
case
was
an
unfortunate
one
to
bring
here
from
the
government’s
point
of
view.
in
the
first,
the
charge
there,
the
issue
there
related
to
a
charge
under
the
conspiracy
statute
which
is
i
suppose
the
most
general
of
all
criminal
statutes,
the
one
most
subject
to
undue
extension
by
a
wide
ranging
prosecutor.
in
the
second
place,
the
prosecution
of
congressman
johnson
largely
turned
on
a
speech
which
he
made
on
the
floor
of
congress,
that
is
the
prosecution
with
respect
to
this,
there
was
also
another
count
of
a
conflict
of
interest
which
related
to
his
appearances
in
the
department
of
justice,
but
the
conspiracy
charge
related
to
a
speech
he
had
made
in
the
floor
of
congress
relating
to
building
and
loan
associations.
although
the
record
was
a
long
one
and
had
many
things
in
it,
50
pages
of
the
transcript
related
to
the
speech
in
the
case
presented
by
the
government
and
there
was
much
more
about
the
speech
in
the
presentation
of
the
defense.
the
government
indeed
introduced
a
copy
of
the
speech
in
evidence.
the
conspiracy
charge
was
that
the
speech
was
not
made
for
any
legislative
purpose,
but
was
made
by
congressman
johnson
for
fee
in
order
to
that
might
reprinted
and
distributed
to
prospective
depositors
so
as
to
encourage
them
to
make
deposits
in
maryland’s
savings
and
loan
associations.
it
is
also
relevant
i
think
that
the
indictment
contained
a
substantial
allegation
about
the
speech
and
this
was
reproduced
in
this
court’s
opinion
at
page
184,
at
paragraph
15,
i
read
from
the
opinion.
it
was
a
part
of
said
conspiracy
that
it
said,
thomas
f.
johnson
should
render
services
for
compensation
to
with
the
making
of
a
speech,
defending
the
operations
of
maryland’s
independent
savings
and
loan
associations,
the
financial
stability
insolvency
thereof
and
the
reliability
and
integrity
of
the
commercial
insurance
on
investments
made
by
said
independent
savings
and
loan
associations
on
the
floor
of
the
house
of
representatives.
thus,
that
was
a
central
part
of
the
actual
charge
in
that
case.
it
should
be
observed
too
that
the
court’s
opinion
is
narrowly
guarded.
on
page
184
of
the
opinion,
justice
harlan
said
near
the
top
of
the
page,
whatever
room
the
constitution
may
allow
for
such
factors
in
the
context
of
a
different
kind
of
prosecution
and
here
we
clearly
have
a
different
kind
of
prosecution
and
then
on
page
185,
justice
harlan
said
we
emphasize
that
our
holding
is
limited
to
prosecutions
involving
circumstances
such
as
those
presented
in
the
case
before
us
which
involved
extensive
utilization
of
the
central
factor
in
the
prosecution
of
the
making
of
a
speech.
and
the
court
said
we
expressly
leave
open
for
consideration
when
the
cases
arises,
a
prosecution
which
though
possibly
entailing
inquiring
into
legislative
acts
or
motivations
is
founded
on
a
narrowly
drawn
statute
passed
by
congress
in
the
exercise
of
its
legislative
part
to
regulate
the
conduct
of
its
members.
mr.
erwin
griswold
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
think
very
likely
not
because
of
the
extensive
use
of
the
speech.
it
is
a
little
hard
for
me
to
answer
it
because
the
very
fact
that
it
was
a
conspiracy
charge
and
that
you
would
then
been
had
to
allege
the
extensive
activities
to
support
the
conspiracy
is
part
of
what
brought
up
the
problem
and
i
would
agree
that
if
this
case
went
to
trial
and
we
ended
up
with
a
record
like
that
in
the
johnson
case
that
we
might
will
have
a
very
serious
problem.
it
will
not
be
my
responsibility
to
try
the
case.
mr.
erwin
griswold
mr.
justice
i
would
be
prepared
to
defend
that.
under
the
johnson
decision
it
is
a
more
difficult
case
than
we
have
here,
though
not
a
great
deal
more
difficult
because
this
one
refers
to
both.
mr.
erwin
griswold
no
mr.
justice.
i
think
the
court
has
at
times
equated
speeches.
mr.
erwin
griswold
mr.
justice
i
am
not
quite
going
to
accept
that
in
all
its
impact.
after
all,
the
speech
and
debate
clause
refers
only
to
speech
and
debate.
and
--
mr.
erwin
griswold
i
am
just
not
arguing
it.
i
recognize
that
it
is
closely
related,
but
some
of
the
talk
to
the
effect
that
some
of
the
references
in
the
opinions
to
the
effect
that
it
applies
to
both
says
well.
it
seems
to
me
to
be
an
example
of
that
well-known
circumstance
that
we
are
always
dealing
with
of
the
tendency
of
principles
to
expand
themselves
to
the
limit
of
their
logic.
and
all
that
i
need
to
say
here
is
that
the
johnson
case
involving
extensive
use
of
the
speech
which
is
precisely
what
the
constitution
refers
to,
speech
or
debate.
for
example,
there
are
other
extensions
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause
made
so
far
in
mr.
ramsey’s
brief
that
it
applies
to
any
activity
conducted
by
a
senator
or
congressman
in
connection
with
his
legislative
work
and
i
think
that
is
far
to
extensive.
now,
i
agree
that
the
line
between
vote
and
the
speech
is
pretty
small,
but
the
constitution
refers
only
to
speech
and
i
think
that
language
in
the
opinion
in
johnson
case
to
which
i
just
referred,
indicates
that
if
there
is
reference
to
a
vote,
but
it
is
incidental
and
then
sure
is
not
be
the
essence
of
the
charge
that
the
constitutional
provision
does
not
make
it
impossible
for
congress
to
allocate
the
determination
of
the
factual
matters
involved
with
respect
to
bribery
of
a
congress
or
senator
to
the
courts.
mr.
erwin
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
it
is
speech
or
debate
rather
than
speech
and
debate.
i
do
not
think
that
in
this
context
makes
any
difference.
i
would
suppose
that
if
they
had
wanted
to
say
vote,
it
might
have
occurred
to
somebody
before
any
speech,
debate
or
vote
in
either
house,
if
the
vote
is
expressly
left
out.
if
the
court
feels
that
the
speech
or
debate
clause
makes
it
impossible
for
congress
to
make
it
a
crime
for
a
congressman
to
accept
a
bribe
then
this
appeal
must
fail.
i
do
not
think
that
the
johnson
case
decided
that.
i
do
not
think
that
the
speech
or
debate
clause
requires
that
conclusion.
i
think
that
the
johnson
case
itself
expressly
left
this
question
open
and
indicated
that
under
a
properly
drawn
statute
the
mere
fact
that
was
some
reference
to
a
vote
was
not
fatal.
mr.
erwin
griswold
i
am
walking
right
up
to
that
mr.
justice.
i
agree
that
the
court
has
said
several
times
in
somewhat
sweeping
ways
that
it
goes
beyond
speech
or
debate.
however,
as
i
read
the
constitution,
what
the
constitution
says
is
speech
or
debate
and
i
still
find
some
difficulty
in
seeing
how
it
is
appropriate
to
construe
it
to
apply
to
other
things
than
speech
or
debate
and
i
know
of
no
case
where
the
court
has
so
decided.
mr.
erwin
griswold
well.
mr.
erwin
griswold
i
recall
that
and
it
is
there
and
that
i
am
not
contending
that
it
is
limited
to
speech
or
literally
to
speech.
i
am
perfectly
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
words
have
to
be
construed
in
a
broader
significance,
but
what
i
am
trying
to
maintain
is
that
the
mere
fact
that
there
is
a
reference
in
this
indictment
to
a
vote,
it
does
not
mean
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
this
--
the
charge
of
this
indictment
and
i
am
suggesting
that
the
court
has
never
so
decided.
mr.
erwin
griswold
well,
i
would
think
not
myself,
but
--
well,
let
me
modify
that.
i
think
of
course
that
a
congressman
or
senator
should
be
protected
against
suit
for
libel,
from
things
said
in
committee
hearing,
but
the
constitutional
provision
is
for
any
speech
or
debate
in
either
house.
we
do
not
have
that
issue
here.
i
repeat
i
think
that
some
of
the
language
in
some
of
the
cases
has
been
very
broad
and
that
there
are
no
decisions
on
such
matters
even
with
respect
to
what
is
said
in
committee
hearing,
but
it
is
not
--
there
is
nothing
about
a
committee
hearing
in
this
case,
it
is
not
necessary
to
decide
that.
i
would
like
in
the
brief
time
remaining
to
refer
to
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute
because
as
it
is
now
stands
it
is
in
some
what
broad
language.
this
is
the
statute
which
is
quoted
on
pages
2
and
3
of
our
brief.
it
refers
to
public
official
who
does
these
things
and
then
public
official
is
defined
to
include
member
of
congress.
this
is
not
brought
out
in
our
brief
and
i
would
like
an
opportunity
very
briefly
to
present
it.
the
history
of
the
statutory
provision
is
that
in
1853,
congress
enacted
a
statute
which
was
specifically
applicable
to
members
of
congress
who
take
bribes
and
to
take
bribes
with
intent
to
influence
his
vote
or
decision
on
any
question.
from
on
1853
on,
congress
has
specifically
provided
that
it
was
a
crime
for
a
congressman
or
the
senator
to
take
a
bribe
intended
to
influence
his
vote.
that
was
continued
in
the
revised
statutes
of
1874
and
1878.
it
was
continued
in
the
criminal
code
of
1908
and
it
was
in
effect
in
1962,
when
congress
passed
the
present
statute,
but
it
is
entirely
clear
that
in
enacting
the
present
statute
the
motivation
to
consolidate
a
lot
of
separate
bribery
provisions
dealing
with
public
officials
generally
came
from
congress,
not
from
the
executive.
there
was
a
report
by
a
staff
of
subcommittee
number
5
of
the
committee
on
judiciary
of
the
house
of
representatives
in
1958,
which
recommended
the
consolidation
of
these
provisions.
at
page
71
of
that
report
it
is
recommended
that
the
provisions
prohibiting
the
bribery
of
federal
employees,
members
of
congress
and
judges
and
judicial
officers
including
jurors
be
combined
in
a
single
statute
and
then
that
is
carried
forward
in
the
committee
reports,
senate
report
of
number
2213
in
the
87th
congress.
the
current
bribery
laws
consist
of
separate
sections
applicable
to
various
categories
or
persons,
government
employees,
members
of
congress,
judges
and
others.
section
201
would
bring
all
these
categories
within
the
purview
of
one
section
and
make
uniform
the
prescribed
act
of
bribery
as
well
as
the
intent
or
purpose
involved.
and
there
is
a
similar
provision
in
the
house
committee
report
which
is
house
report
number
748
in
the
87th
congress.
now,
whether
at
that
time
as
you
may
recall
a
considerable
development
of
thought
about
conflict
of
interest,
a
bill
with
respect
to
conflict
and
interest
came
before
congress
and
it
was
at
the
initiative
of
the
senate
judiciary,
of
the
house
judiciary
committee
that
these
provisions
with
respect
to
bribery
or
consolidated
and
introduced
in
the
same
bill.
and
i
think
it
is
perfectly
fair
to
say
that
this
statute
should
be
construed
in
the
light
of
its
clear
and
long
continued
history
as
one
which
in
part
at
least
is
focused
by
a
congress
on
the
actions
of
congressmen
and
senators
and
amounts
to
a
clear
declaration
by
congress
that
this
sort
of
conduct
should
be
tried
in
the
courts
with
the
procedural
safeguards
and
provisions
which
are
applicable
to
criminal
prosecutions
before
the
judiciary.
mr.
erwin
griswold
in
1962.
mr.
erwin
griswold
it
was
1958
that
the
house
committee
recommended
that
they
be
consolidated.
when
the
conflict
of
interest
statute
came
along,
that
was
put
in
as
a
part
of
it
and
it
was
in
1962
that
all
the
various
bribery
provisions
were
brought
together
into
a
single
statute
which
looks
quite
broad
as
it
is
now,
but
which
in
the
light
of
its
historical
background
is
it
seems
to
me
quite
narrowly
focused
in
this
application
on
bribery
of
congressmen
and
senators.
mr.
erwin
griswold
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
unless
this
court
is
prepared
to
hold
that
congress
has
no
constitutional
power
to
make
it
a
crime
for
a
congressman
or
senator
to
accept
a
bribe
for
any
sort
of
conduct
with
respect
to
his
legislative
responsibilities,
i
believe
that
this
judgment
should
be
reversed.
mr.
erwin
griswold
when
i
said
make
it
a
crime,
i
meant
a
crime
in
the
traditional
sense
by
indictment
by
a
grand
jury
and
prosecution
in
court.
there
is
not
any
doubt
that
either
house
has
the
power
to
subject
to
penalty
or
to
expel
a
member
who
does
anything
which
the
house
thinks
warrants
that.
there
is
a
further
problem
which
is
been
referred
to
in
the
cases
which
is
as
far
as
the
house
of
representatives
is
concerned,
imprisonment
can
extend
only
until
the
termination
of
that
session
of
the
house
and
that
if
the
bribery
was
not
found
until
in
the
old
days
that
is
2nd
of
march,
you
have
to
hold
the
trial
and
he
would
be
release
on
the
04th
of
march
whenever
the
congress
expires.
moreover,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
the
practical
problems
with
respect
to
trial
of
these
matters
before
the
house
or
the
senate
are
difficult.
a
fair
trial
of
one
of
these
matters
might
be
complicated,
might
take
the
time
for
a
month
of
the
congressman
and
the
senators
and
i
repeat,
if
congress
chooses
to
allocate
that
to
the
regular
courts,
unless
the
court
is
prepared
to
hold
that
congress
cannot
constitutionally
do
that,
this
judgment
should
be
reversed.
i
would
repeat
--
mr.
erwin
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice
that.
mr.
erwin
griswold
that
is
true
and
that
point
is
made
that
with
respect
to
the
contempt
of
a
witness
that
it
does
require
a
resolution
of
the
house
on
recommendation
from
the
committee
before
it
goes
to
the
executive
for
proper
action
--
mr.
erwin
griswold
and
that
is
not
required
in
this
instance.
mr.
erwin
griswold
it
would
be
our
position
that
the
executive
could
go
ahead
under
this
statute
and
i
repeat
our
position
is
that
unless
the
court
is
prepared
to
hold,
that
congress
has
no
constitutional
power
to
make
it
a
crime
for
a
congressman
or
senator
to
accept
a
bribe
for
a
legislative
conduct,
this
judgment
should
be
reversed.
let
me
refer
to
the
fact
that
the
statute
in
this
case
as
it
now
stands
makes
no
reference
whatever
to
vote.
it
simply
says,
if
before
him
in
his
official
capacity
and
though
i
do
not
need
to
go
so
far,
i
think
that
a
conviction
could
be
sustained
under
this
indictment
without
any
showing
as
to
how
a
senator
brewster
voted
on
any
matter
or
indeed
without
any
evidence
that
he
voted
at
all.
finally,
i
would
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
there
was
a
concurring
opinion
in
the
johnson
case
by
chief
justice
warren
and
in
which
justices
brennan
and
douglas
concurred,
which
proceeded
on
the
narrow
ground
of
the
extensive
use
of
the
speech
in
that
case,
thus
there
is
nothing
there
decided
beyond
that
by
anything
except
a
four
to
three
decision
and
our
position
is
that
the
problem
of
this
case
was
not
only
expressly
left
open,
but
a
considerable
intimation
that
the
court
did
not
think
that
it
should
go
as
far
in
construing
this
rather
simple
language
of
the
speech
and
debate
clause
as
to
make
it
impossible
for
congress
by
statute
to
make
it
a
crime
for
a
congressman
or
senator
to
accept
the
bribe.
mr.
erwin
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
reargument.
it
is
a
direct
appeal
from
a
decision
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
dismissing
an
indictment
on
constitutional
grounds.
the
indictment
appears
beginning
on
page
1
of
the
appendix.
it
consists
of
nine
counts
or
ten
counts.
the
odd
numbered
ones
of
which
relate
to
the
defendant
former
senator
brewster.
the
even
numbered
counts
are
not
before
the
court
at
all
and
the
first
count
may
be
taken
as
for
the
purposes
of
this
appeal
as
typical
of
the
rest
raising
the
question
which
was
decided.
the
first
allegation
in
the
account
is
that
at
all
times
here
after
mentioned
in
this
indictment,
daniel
b.
brewster
was
a
public
official
that
is
a
member
of
the
senate
of
the
untied
states
from
the
state
of
maryland.
and
then
over
on
page
2
of
the
indictment
are
the
principal
allegation
of
the
first
count
is
that
daniel
b.
brewster
being
a
public
official,
acting
for
and
on
behalf
thereof
directly
and
indirectly
corruptly
as
solicited,
sought,
accepted,
received
and
agreed
to
receive
the
sum
of
$5,000.00
for
himself
and
for
an
entity
in
return
for
being
influenced
in
his
performance
of
official
acts
in
respect
to
his
action,
route
and
decision
on
postage
rate
legislation
which
might
at
any
time
be
pending
before
him
in
his
official
capacity
and
in
his
place
of
trust
and
profit
in
violation
of
section
201
(c)
(1)
and
2,
title
18,
united
states
code.
after
the
indictment
was
found,
defendant
through
his
counsel
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment.
in
fact
two
motions
dismissed,
but
the
only
one
that’s
here
is
the
one
which
appears
on
page
8
of
the
appendix.
and
the
motion
to
dismiss,
the
odd
numbered
counts
of
the
indictment
was
on
the
ground
that
in
each
such
count,
the
defendant
is
charged
with
being
influenced
in
his
performance
of
official
acts
in
his
capacity
as
a
united
states
senator.
and
then
finally
the
third
reason
of
the
motion
to
dismiss
each
count
of
the
indictment
as
charged
against
this
defendant
violates
the
provision
of
article
1,
section
6
of
the
united
states
constitution
which
is
the
speech
and
debate
clause
which
it
will
be
remembered,
said
in
in
rather
simple
terms
that
for
any
speech
or
debate
in
either
house
senators
or
representatives
shall
not
be
questioned
in
any
other
place.
the
language,
the
important
language
here
is,
in
a
speech
or
debate
in
either
house.
and
then
the
order
of
the
court
from
which
this
appeal
is
taken
appears
on
page
34
of
the
appendix
ordered
that
the
defendant's
motion
be
granted
and
the
indictment
be
and
hereby
is
dismissed
as
to
the
defendant
brewster
for
the
reason
stated
orally
by
the
court
at
the
hearing
on
october
9,
1970.
and
those
reasons
appear
on
the
preceding
page,
page
33
where
the
court
said,
“gentleman,
based
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
it
is
admitted
by
the
government
that
the
five
counts
of
the
indictment
which
charge
senator
brewster
relate
to
the
acceptance
of
bribes
in
connection
with
the
performance
of
a
legislative
function
by
a
senator
of
the
united
states.”
now
i
suggest
that
that’s
simply
a
paraphrase
of
exactly
what
the
indictment
says.
and
then
it
is
the
opinion
of
the
court
that
the
immunity
under
the
speech
and
debate
clause
of
the
constitution,
particularly
in
view
of
the
interpretation
given
that
clause
by
the
supreme
court
in
johnson’s
shields
senator
brewster,
constitutionally
shields
him
from
any
prosecution
for
alleged
bribery
to
perform
a
legislative
act.
the
question
of
the
jurisdiction
of
this
appeal
has
been
deferred
to
the
hearing
of
the
merits
of
--
i
find
it
myself
somewhat
difficult
to
see
that
there
is
doubt
as
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
appeal.
this
arises
under
the
old
version
of
the
criminal
appeal’s
act,
since
the
indictment
was
found
here
before
january
1971
and
it
seems
to
us
that
this
appeal
comes
under
two
of
the
clauses
of
that
statute.
there
is
a
suggestion
in
mr.
ramsey’s
brief
that
for
some
reason
the
statute
is
not
applicable
because
of
a
reference
to
a
conference
memorandum
which
was
said
to
be
before
the
judge.
it
is
not
in
the
appendix.
i
have
never
seen
it.
i
would
like
to
suggest
that
with
respect
to
it
that
there
is
no
procedure
for
summary
judgment
in
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
i
think
that
there
is
a
sort
of
spillover
here
because
we're
familiar
with
the
summary
judgment
and
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
that
this
is
in
some
way
a
decision
on
a
summary
judgment,
but
i
know
of
no
procedure
and
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure
for
summary
judgment.
and
then
i
would
like
to
suggest
and
mr.
ramsey
says
that
this
was
the
equivalent
of
an
acquittal.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
no
jury
had
been
impaneled,
no
trial
had
been
commenced,
and
i
would
like
to
suggest
that
as
far
as
anything
that
i
have
heard
of
in
the
law
of
criminal
procedure,
so
far
there
cannot
be
an
acquittal,
except
at
a
trial
that
is
until
a
jury
has
been
impaneled.
now,
this
becomes
a
little
complicated
in
the
case
of
a
trial
without
jury,
but
i
still
suggest
that
there
cannot
be
an
acquittal
without
a
trial
that
is
that
the
commencement
of
trial
without
a
jury
is
a
rather
formal
act,
likely
impaneling
of
a
jury
and
requires
among
other
things
that
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
has
been
waived.
there
was
no
such
waiver
here
and
there
was
no
trial.
there
cannot
be
double
jeopardy
until
there
has
been
jeopardy.
i
hear
no
jury
had
been
empanelled
and
jeopardy
had
not
attached.
i
would
like--in
closing
the
jurisdictional
part
of
my
argument
to
refer
to
decisions
of
this
court,
which
are
not
cited
in
my
brief.
one
of
them,
the
first
of
them
is
cited
in
an
early
brief
of
mr.
ramsey,
though
for
another
point.
that
is
the
case
of
united
states
against
fruehauf
in
365
u.s.
where
the
situation
is
almost
exactly
parallel
to
that
here.
there
had
been
memoranda
before
the
district
court.
there
was
a
direct
appeal
to
this
court
under
the
criminal
appeals
act.
if
the
position
taken
now
by
mr.
ramsey
is
correct,
even
assuming
that
the
conference
memorandum
to
which
he
refers
is
a
part
of
the
record
here
that
appeal
should
have
been
dismissed
on
the
ground
that
there
had
been
a
decision
under
summary
judgment
or
an
acquittal.
that
the
decision
--
not
only
that
appeal,
not
only
was
not
dismissed,
but
the
case
was
sent
back
to
the
district
court
for
trial.
and
then
another
case
which
is
not
cited
in
our
brief,
but
it
is
so
closely
parallel
that
i
think
it
is
appropriate
to
mention
in
here,
united
states
against
halseth,
that
is
342
u.s.
277,
where
it
appeared
that
there
had
been
stipulation
in
the
district
court.
and
there
again,
if
the
decision
of
the
court
with
respect
to
that
stipulation
had
amounted
to
an
acquittal
or
a
decision
on
a
summary
judgment,
the
appeal
should
have
been
dismissed,
but
the
appeal
was
not
dismissed.
both
of
these
cases
are
discussed
in
mr.
justice
harlan’s
opinion
in
the
united
states
against
sisson
in
399
u.s.
but
i
would
point
out
that
the
sisson
case
is
clearly
inapplicable
here
because
there
had
been
a
full
trial
and
the
judges’
decision
which
amounted
to
the
entry
of
a
judgment,
not
withstanding
the
verdict
was
based
on
facts
which
appeared
at
the
trial.
thus,
jeopardy
had
attached
and
the
basis
for
an
appeal
was
removed
as
was
held
in
the
simmons
case
itself.
now,
turning
to
the
merits
here,
the
case
is
of
course
the
step
beyond
the
court’s
decision
in
united
states
against
johnson
which
was
decided
some
six
years
ago.
the
appellee
relies
on
the
johnson
decision,
but
i
think
that
it
is
by
its
own
terms
inapplicable
here.
with
the
benefit
of
hindsight,
one
can
say
that
the
johnson
case
was
an
unfortunate
case
to
bring
before
the
court.
the
charge
there
was
under
the
conspiracy
statute
which
is
a
very
general
statute.
while
the
charge
here
is
under
a
bribery
statute,
one
which
with
respect
to
congressmen
and
senators
has
a
continuous
history
going
back
to
1853,
119
years
during
which
time
congress
has
expressly
said
that
when
a
congressman
or
a
senator
accepts
a
bribe,
he
should
be
subject
to
prosecution
through
the
regular
procedures
of
the
criminal
courts.
but
in
the
johnson
case
as
well,
not
much
concern
was
given
about
the
speech
or
debate
clause
in
initiating
the
prosecution
or
in
carrying
it
out.
in
that
case,
the
indictment
contained
a
specific
reference
to
the
speech
and
debate
clause
which
was
quoted
at
some
length
in
the
court’s
opinion.
this
is
on
page
184
and
paragraph
15
of
the
indictment
said
it
was
party
said
conspiracy
that
the
said
thomas
f.
johnson
should
render
services
for
compensation
to
whip
the
making
of
a
speech
defending
the
operations
of
maryland
saving
loan
associations
and
so
on.
mr.
erwin
griswold
i
do
not
recall
mr.
chief
justice.
i
do
not
believe
that
it
appears
anywhere
in
the
opinion
of
this
court.
i
have
not
searched
through
the
record
as
to
what
was
done
in
the
district
court.
not
only
was
this
in
the
indictment,
but
at
the
trial
itself,
some
50
pages
of
the
transcript
related
to
the
speech
in
the
case
presented
by
the
government
and
having
been
so
opened
up
by
the
government,
there
was
much
more
about
the
speech
in
the
presentation
of
the
defense.
the
government
introduced
a
copy
of
the
speech
in
evidence
and
devoted
substantial
argument
to
the
preposition
that
the
nature
of
the
conspiracy
was
that
the
speech
should
be
delivered
in
order
that
it
could
be
reprinted
and
distributed
among
appropriate
persons
in
maryland.
now,
with
respect
to
the
johnson
case.
it
is
very
significant
that
the
opinion
was
narrowly
guarded
on
page
184
of
the
opinion.
the
court
said,
"whatever
room
the
constitution
may
allow
for
such
factors
in
the
context
of
a
different
kind
of
prosecution."
and
this
of
course
is
a
bribery
prosecution,
not
a
conspiracy
prosecution.
and
then
on
page
185,
the
court
said,
"we
emphasize
that
our
holding
is
limited
to
prosecutions
involving
circumstances
as
those
presented
in
the
case
before
us.
we
expressly
leave
open
for
consideration
when
the
case
arises
a
prosecution
which
though
possibly
entailing
inquiry
in
the
legislative
acts
on
motivations
is
founded
upon
a
nearly
drawn
statute
passed
by
congress
in
the
exercise
of
its
legislative
power
to
regulate
the
conduct
of
its
members."
then
i
think
it’s
not
irrelevant
to
point
out
those
three
members
of
the
court,
chief
justice
warren
and
justices
douglas
and
brennan
concurred
only
in
the
limited
holding
of
the
court
that
the
use
of
the
congressman
speech
during
this
particular
trial
within
examination
into
its
authorship,
motivation
and
content,
it
was
violative
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
two
members
of
the
court
took
no
part
in
the
case,
so
that
there
were
only
four
justices
who
concurred
in
anything
broader
than
the
limited
holding
referred
to
in
chief
justice
warren’s
opinion.
now,
there’s
nothing
like
this
in
this
case.
there
is
no
speech
at
all.
indeed
as
i’ve
indicated,
there’s
no
evidence
before
the
court,
there
was
no
examination
into
the
authorship,
motivation
and
content
of
any
speech.
there
is
a
reference
in
each
count
to
the
effect
that
senator
brewster
is
charged
with
taking
a
bribe
and
i
quote
“in
return
for
being
influenced
in
his
performance
of
official
acts
in
respect
of
to
his
action,
vote
and
decision
on
postage
rate
legislation.”
mr.
erwin
griswold
i
think
not
mr.
chief
justice
if
the
defendant
was
the
one
who
brought
that
out.
i
am
a
little
concerned
if
the
prosecution
relies
on
a
vote.
mr.
erwin
griswold
if
the
defendant
brings
it
out,
i
assume
he
can
waive
–-
well
i
don’t
know,
it
says,
shall
not
be
questioned
unless
he
relies
on
it.
i
find
it
hard
to
see
how
he
can
complain
that
he
is
being
questioned.
i
would
think
certainly
under
the
johnson
case,
it
is
clear
that
the
government
cannot
maintain
the
prosecution
if
it
relies
directly
on
the
giving
of
a
speech.
there
is
some
reference
in
the
opinion
to
tangential
use.
i
do
not
quite
know
just
what
tangential
use
means.
i
would
think
that
it
might
perhaps
be
within
that
language
if
it
were
shown
that
there
was
a
speech,
but
if
the
text
of
the
speech
was
not
relied
on
and
if
the
motivation
and
authorship
of
the
speech
were
not
gone
into.
but
i
would
suggest
mr.
chief
justice
that
this
indictment
at
this
stage
can
be
sustained
without
answering
these
questions.
i
don’t
know
just
where
the
line
is.
i
know
that
the
constitution
says
speech
or
debate
in
either
house
and
i
don’t
think
that
is
broad
enough
or
ought
to
be
held
to
be
broad
enough
to
cover
things
which
occur
outside
of
sessions
of
the
house
which
might
be
construed
to
include
sessions
of
committees.
committee
may
be
for
this
purpose
is
something
done
in
the
house.
it
doesn’t
say
both,
but
i
am
troubled
about
vote
and
there
are
opinions
of
the
court
which
have
indicated,
though
i
do
not
think
actually
decided
that
vote
may
be
enough.
but
this
indictment
charges
him
of
receiving
a
bribe
for
being
influenced
in
his
performance
of
official
acts.
in
respect
to
his
action,
vote
and
decision,
on
postage
rate
legislation
or
i
suppose
we
strikeout
votes,
supposed
we
say
that
can’t
be
referred
to,
i
don’t
conceded
that,
but
let’s
strike
it
out.
there
is
still
plenty
in
this
indictment
and
the
evidence
of
the
trial
may
show
nothing
relating
to
a
vote.
there
is
no
charge
with
respect
to
his
speech
which
is
the
only
thing
to
which
the
johnson
case
applies.
and
unless
the
court
is
prepared
to
hold
that
nothing
that
a
senator
does
as
a
senator
can
be
questioned
in
any
other
place
under
the
speech
and
debate
clause,
a
result
prior
beyond
anything
that
has
ever
yet
been
decided.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
no
basis
for
holding
that
this
indictment
of
itself
without
any
evidence
is
in
violation
of
the
speech
and
debate
clause.
our
position
--
mr.
erwin
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice
marshall.
it
would
be
our
position
that
the
crime
is
committed
when
the
bribe
is
either
solicited
or
received.
he
doesn’t
have
to
receive
it
with
the
requisite
intent
and
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
prove
that
there
was
in
fact
any
legislative
act
of
any
kind.
and,
i
think
that
becomes
quite
clear
when
you
consider
the
solicitation
language
in
the
statute
ask,
demands,
seeks,
solicits
any
bribe
it
would
not
be
possible
to
prosecute
the
solicitation
of
a
bribe
if
the
other
construction
of
the
statute
is
taken
until
you
waited
to
see
whether
he
did
something.
and
as
i
have
tried
to
develop
in
the
supplemental
brief
which
we
have
filed,
i
think
that
a
prosecution
under
this
statute
can
be
maintained
and
that
the
indictment
is
sufficient
without
the
showing
of
any
speech
or
debate
of
any
kind,
without
the
showing
of
any
action.
if
there
is
evidence
which
can
show
that
at
the
time
he
solicited
or
received
the
bribe,
he
intended
to
take
legislative
action
in
accordance
with
the
bribes
request.
mr.
erwin
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
seems
to
me
that
mr.
ramsey
unduly
treats
legislative
act
as
synonymous
with
and
absolutely
the
equivalent
of
speech
or
debate.
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution
which
relates
and
which
refers
in
anyway
to
legislative
acts
and
we
submit
that
there
are
many
acts
which
a
legislator
may
do
and
may
properly
do
as
a
legislator
which
are
appropriate
for
a
congressman
or
senator
to
do
which
are
customarily
done
by
congressman
or
senators
which
are
not
speech
or
debate
and
which
are
not
within
the
protection
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
if
the
court
should
reach
the
conclusion
that
the
speech
or
debate
clause
protects
a
congressman
or
senator
with
respect
to
anything
that
he
does
after
he
takes
the
oath
of
office,
our
case
would
be
difficult.
although,
as
mr.
justice
marshall
has
suggested,
it
is
very
hard
to
accept
the
conclusion
that
taking
a
bribe
is
a
legislative
act
even
within
a
very
broad
definition
of
that
term.
as
we
see
in
this
case,
the
case
can
be
proved
without
bringing
in
to
question
any
legislative
act,
any
speech
or
debate,
the
only
word
in
the
indictment
which
gives
me
any
pause
at
all
is
the
word
“vote.”
if
the
word
vote
were
not
there,
if
we
now
excise
it,
we
make
no
use
of
it,
i
can
find
that
nothing
in
the
indictment
which
is
in
anyway
in
conflict
with
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
it
is
suggested,
turning
to
another
matter,
that
the
matter
of
punishing
a
senator
who
takes
the
bribe
is
by
the
constitution
committed
solely
to
that
house
of
congress
and
that
congress
has
a
legislative
body,
has
no
power
to
deal
with
that.
i
should
think
that
that
was
adequately
disposed
off
by
this
court’s
decision
in
the
burton
case,
some
60
years
ago,
where
a
congressman
was
convicted
under
a
statute
for
taking
fees
in
connection
with
appearances
before
the
executive
branch
of
the
government.
and
more
recently
in
powell
against
mccormick
where
a
similar
argument
has
made,
that
the
power
of
congress
of
the
house
or
the
senate
to
exclude
was
exclusive
and
that
prevented
the
court
from
giving
a
declaratory
judgment
on
the
matter.
both
of
those
cases
seem
to
me
to
dispose
of
that
contention.
and
then
finally,
as
has
been
suggested
in
the
argument,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
--
or
our
position
is
here,
that
the
offense
was
committed
when
the
bribe
was
solicited
or
taken
with
the
requisite
intent.
it
is
immaterial
thereafter,
whether
any
action
including
even
any
legislative
action
that
short
of
speech
or
debate
was
done.
the
argument
is
that
rather
similar
to
that
which
was
rejected
in
the
case
in
the
second
circuit
involving
judge
matten,
or
a
part
of
the
defense
was--it's
a
different
statute,
the
case
is
not
controlling
but
the
analogy
is
close.
part
of
the
defense
was
that
though
we
took
the
bribe,
it
didn’t
influences
decisions
that
all
of
the
cases
were
decided
right
and
a
part
of
the
charge
which
was
sought
to
be
submitted
to
the
jury
there
was,
that
if
the
case
where
decided
right,
and
then
he
could
not
be
convicted.
that
was--the
argument
that
was
rejected
by
court
of
appeals
which
mr.
justice
sutherland
sat
and
that
the
decision
was
that
the
taking
in
the
bribe
completed
the
offense
and
it
was
not
necessary
to
show
that
the
promised
action
was
carried
out.
similarly
here,
the
taking
of
the
bribe,
at
least
for
the
record
was
an
intent,
is
the
essence
and
the
substance
of
the
offense
and
as
we
see
it,
it
is
not
necessary
to
prove
certainly
any
speech
or
debate
in
order
to
maintain
the
prosecution
accordingly.
we
think
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
mr.
erwin
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
direct
appeal
from
a
decision
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
which
has
held
that
an
act
of
congress,
generally
applicable
throughout
the
united
states
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
the
offense
charged
in
the
criminal
indictment
before
it.
the
offense,
to
put
it
simply,
is
bribery
and
the
defendant
against
whom
the
charge
is
made
was
a
united
states
senator
at
the
time
charged
is
now
a
former
united
states
senator.
the
facts
are
simple.
there
is
virtually
nothing
before
the
court
except
the
indictment,
found
by
the
grand
jury
and
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment
which
was
granted.
the
indictment
contains
a
number
of
counts.
the
odd
numbered
counts
relate
to
the
defendant,
the
alleged
bribee.
the
even
number
counts
relate
to
the
parties
who
are
charged
with
having
offered
or
given
the
bribe,
or
the
briber.
and
the
underlying
facts
appear
on
page
1
of
the
appendix
in
the
--
as
alleged
in
the
indictment,
that
at
all
times,
daniel
brewster
was
a
public
official
of
the
united
states,
a
member
of
the
senate
of
the
united
states
from
the
state
of
maryland.
and
then
the
gist
of
the
charge
appears
on
page
2
of
the
appendix
with
respect
to
count
1
and
i
repeat,
the
odd
numbered
count
relates
to
senator
brewster
and
are
all
essentially
the
same
as
far
as
the
issue
now
before
the
court
is
concerned
and
the
charge
is
that
he
corruptly
asked,
solicited,
sought,
accepted,
received
and
agreed
to
receive
the
sum
of
$5,000.00
for
himself
and
for
an
entity,
that
is
the
dc
committee
from
maryland
education,
from
cyrus
t
anderson
and
spiegel
inc.
in
return
for
being
influenced
in
his
performance
of
official
acts
in
respect
of
his
action,
vote
and
decision
on
postage
rate
legislation
which
might
at
any
time
be
pending
before
him
in
his
official
capacity.
now,
the
motion
which
was
filed
on
behalf
of
the
defendant
appears
on
page
8
of
the
appendix.
there
is
also
another
motion
on
page
9
which
relates
to
vagueness
and
things
to
that
sort
which
was
not
dealt
with
in
any
way
by
the
district
court
and
an
appeal
under
the
criminal
appeals
act
brings
to
this
court
only
the
issue
which
was
dealt
with,
excuse
me,
this
is
not
the
criminal
appeals
act,
this
is
the
act
allowing
direct
appeals
in
cases
where
an
act
to
congress
has
been
held
unconstitutional
and
such
an
appeal
brings
here
only
the
issue
which
was
decided
below.
and
the
motion
to
dismiss
on
page
8
of
the
appendix,
the
defendant
moves
to
dismiss
the
odd
numbered
counts
and
ground
is
that
counts
1,
3,
5,
and
7
of
the
indictment
charged
this
defendant
with
violations
of
18
u.s.c.
201
(c)
(1)
and
in
each
such
count
this
defendant
is
charged
with
being
influenced
in
his
performance
of
official
acts
in
his
capacity
as
a
united
states
senator.
and
there
is
of
course
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
that
is
what
the
indictment
charge
is,
that
he
was
influenced
in
his
official
acts,
in
his
capacity
as
a
united
states
senator.
now,
the
question
of
jurisdiction
of
this
court
was
postponed
until
the
hearing
on
the
merits
and
here
i
find
i
have
made
a
mistake.
this
is
an
appeal
under
the
criminal
appeals
act.
it
might
possibly
have
been
brought
under
the
other
statutes,
but
it
is
an
appeal
under
the
criminal
appeals
act.
the
statute
involved
is
the
former
form
of
section
3731
of
title
xviii
and
known
as
the
criminal
appeals
act.
the
amendment
to
this
provision
which
was
enacted
last
january
is
not
applicable
since
the
case
was
began
by
indictment
on
december
1,
1969,
more
than
a
year
before
the
enactment
of
the
amendment.
the
relevant
provisions
of
the
criminal
appeals
act
are
quoted
on
page
5
of
the
appellee’s
motion
to
dismiss
or
affirm
and
on
page
9
of
the
appellee’s
brief
and
to
refresh
the
court’s
recollection,
i
will
read
the
two
provisions
involved
which
are
at
least
verbally,
relevantly,
relatively
simple.
appeal
lies
to
this
court
under
that
statute
from
a
decision
or
judgment
setting
aside
or
dismissing
any
indictment
or
information
on
any
count
thereof
where
such
decision
or
judgment
is
based
upon
the
invalidity
or
construction
of
the
statute
upon
which
the
indictment
or
information
is
founded.
and
the
other
statute
relating
to
appeals
on
acts
that
--
decisions
holding
act
of
congress
unconstitutional
is
not
applicable
because
it
applies
only
to
civil
cases.
and
this
is
a
criminal
case
and
the
second
head
of
jurisdiction
under
the
old
criminal
appeals
act
is
from
the
decision
or
judgment
sustaining
a
motion
in
bar
when
the
defendant
has
not
been
put
in
jeopardy.
and
we
contend
that
there
is
jurisdiction
under
this
case
under
either
or
both
of
those
two
provisions
of
the
former
criminal
appeals
act.
in
the
first
place,
it
is
entirely
clear
that
the
defendant
has
not
been
put
in
jeopardy.
no
jury
was
empaneled
nor
was
the
case
in
any
way
submitted
to
the
judge
as
a
trier
of
the
facts
with
the
judge
sitting
in
place
of
a
jury.
there
was
simply
the
indictment
and
the
motion
to
dismiss,
the
traditional
way
to
raise
a
legal
question
with
respect
to
a
criminal
indictment
and
thus
the
case
comes
within
the
language
of
justice
harlan
in
the
sisson
case,
where
in
distinguishing
this
court’s
decision
in
united
states
against
covington.
justice
harlan
noted
that
the
dismissal
in
covington
was
“before
trial
without
any
evidentiary
hearing”
and
that
is
printed
in
the
italics
in
the
report
itself.
that
of
course
is
exactly
the
situation
here.
this
was
before
trial
and
without
any
evidentiary
hearing.
and
similarly
the
situation
comes
clearly
within
the
language
used
in
the
court’s
opinion
in
the
jorn
case
last
term
where
it
was
said
that
in
enacting
the
criminal
appeals
act,
congress
wished
“to
avoid
subjecting
the
defendant
to
a
second
trial,
where
the
first
had
terminated
in
a
manner
favorable
to
the
defendant
either
because
of
a
jury
verdict
or
because
of
judicial
action.”
here
there
has
never
been
a
first
trial.
there
has
been
a
motion
to
dismiss
entirely
on
the
face
of
the
pleadings.
there
has
been
a
decision
on
that
motion
to
dismiss,
but
that
is
not
in
the
sense
of
the
criminal
appeals
act
or
the
sense
of
double
jeopardy,
a
trial.
in
this
case
there
was
no
stipulation
of
facts
of
any
sort.
there
was
nothing
that
could
even
be
regarded
as
a
bill
of
particulars
or
anything
like
that.
there
were
no
concessions
by
the
government
of
any
sort,
nor
any
factual
assertions
by
the
government
beyond
what
is
stated
in
the
indictment.
the
entire
proceedings
before
judge
hart
are
printed
in
the
appendix.
i
believe
that
what
i
have
said
with
respect
to
them
is
fully
supported
by
the
record.
there
is
nothing
in
it
to
support
a
contention
that
judge
hart
made
any
sort
of
a
factual
determination
or
adjudication.
what
he
decided
is
that
on
the
facts
alleged
in
the
indictment,
the
statute
cannot
be
constitutionally
applied.
and
mr.
ramsey
quite
properly
points
to
language
which
was
used
by
judge
hart
in
expressing
his
opinion
and
this
appears
on
page
33
of
the
appendix.
and
judge
hart
did
say
right
at
the
middle
of
the
page,
gentlemen,
“based
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
which
sounds
bad
from
my
point
of
view,
it
is
admitted
by
the
government,
which
sounds
bad
from
my
point
of
view,
that
the
five
counts
of
the
indictment
which
charged
senator
brewster
relate
to
the
acceptance
of
bribes
in
connection
with
performance
of
a
legislative
function
by
a
senator
of
the
united
states.”
but
from
an
examination
of
the
transcript,
it
is
readily
apparent
that
the
facts
to
which
judge
hart
was
referring
were
those
stated
in
the
indictment
not
anything
that
was
conceded
by
the
government
or
asserted
by
the
government
or
offered
by
way
of
affidavit,
deposition
in
any
other
way
in
terms
of
facts,
above
and
beyond
the
effects
alleged
in
the
indictment.
and
it
is
also
clear
that
nothing
was
admitted
in
a
factual
sense
by
counsel,
by
--
for
the
government,
before
judge
hart.
insofar
as
counsel
admitted
anything
there,
it
was
that
the
facts
charged
in
the
indictment
are
those
which
are
--
they
are
alleged,
namely
that
the
defendant
was
at
all
relevant
times
a
united
states
senator
and
that
he
is
charged
with
seeking
and
receiving
a
bribe
under
the
circumstances
stated
in
the
indictment.
thus
there
is
clearly
a
case
in
which
the
court
below
has
held
that
an
act
of
congress
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
the
facts
alleged
in
this
indictment.
this
seems
to
come
squarely
within
this
court’s
decision
in
the
knox
case
in
396
u.s.which
upheld
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
under
the
criminal
appeals
act,
where
the
statute
has
been
held
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
the
facts
alleged
in
the
indictment,
although
not
generally
unconstitutional.
it
is
also
our
view
that
there
is
jurisdiction
under
the
other
clause
of
section
3731,
the
one
relating
to
a
motion
in
bar.
we
contend
that
the
assertion
made
in
the
motion
to
dismiss
in
this
case,
namely
that,
this
defendant
is
charged
with
being
influenced
in
his
performance
of
official
acts
in
his
capacity
as
a
united
sated
senator
and
that
the
indictment
for
this
reason
violates
the
provision
of
article
1,
section
6
of
the
united
states
constitution
is
a
motion
in
bar.
sometimes
a
motion
in
bar
is
referred
to
as
a
confession
in
avoidance
and
mr.
ramsey
says
that
the
defendant
has
not
confessed.
i
think
though
that
the
problem
comes
from
too
broader
use
of
the
word
confession.
when
a
person
raises
the
statute
on
limitations
or
a
pardon,
this
is
clearly
within
the
motion
in
bar
provision,
yet
in
such
a
case
the
defendant
need
not
to
confess.
he
says
in
the
effect,
whether
i
did
it
or
not
or
even
if
i
did
do
it,
you
cannot
prosecute
me
because
of
the
statute
of
limitations
or
the
pardon
as
the
case
may
be.
and
this
is
exactly
what
senator
brewster’s
counsel
have
said
here,
whether
i
did
it
or
not
or
even
if
i
did
do
it,
you
cannot
prosecute
me
because
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
this
seems
to
me
to
be
what
is
meant
by
motion
in
bar
as
used
in
this
statute
or
by
the
term
special
plea
in
bar,
which
was
used
in
its
original
form.
it
is
for
example
the
kind
of
motion
that
would
have
been
made
by
a
member
of
the
house
of
commons
in
the
18th
century.
if
there
were
a
charge
against
him
which
he
cannot
allege,
he
came
within
parliamentary
privilege.
what
the
defendant
is
saying
is
that
even
if
i
admitted
all
of
the
facts,
i
have
a
special
defense
that
i
suggest
is
a
motion
in
bar
and
brings
this
case
within
the
jurisdictional
statute.
now,
let
me
turn
to
the
merits
of
the
case
which
is
of
course
a
natural
sequel
to
the
court’s
decision
in
the
johnson
case
in
383
u.s.
decided
little
over
five
years
ago.
understandably
enough,
the
appellee
relies
on
the
johnson
decision
and
it
is
incumbent
on
me
to
show
that
the
facts
there
make
that
case
distinguishable
from
those
which
are
alleged
in
this
indictment
and
i
repeat
we
have
nothing
here
except
the
facts
alleged
in
the
indictment.
it
is
perfectly
possible,
it
seems
to
me
for
this
trial
to
be
conducted
under
this
indictment
in
a
way
which
might
infringe
the
johnson
case
and
if
that
were
done,
there
would
be
another
issue,
but
that
is
not
the
problem
here.
the
problem
here
is
whether
the
trial
can
be
conducted
in
such
a
way
as
not
to
infringe
the
johnson
case
and
i
submit
that
it
can.
mr.
erwin
griswold
the
johnson
case
came
here
after
a
verdict
of
guilty
by
a
jury
in
a
full
trial.
mr.
erwin
griswold
full
transcript
of
the
evidence
and
reversal
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
that
reversal
was
upheld
by
this
court
and
indeed
with
the
benefit
of
hindsight,
it
seems
apparent
that
the
johnson
case
was
an
unfortunate
one
to
bring
here
from
the
government’s
point
of
view.
in
the
first,
the
charge
there,
the
issue
there
related
to
a
charge
under
the
conspiracy
statute
which
is
i
suppose
the
most
general
of
all
criminal
statutes,
the
one
most
subject
to
undue
extension
by
a
wide
ranging
prosecutor.
in
the
second
place,
the
prosecution
of
congressman
johnson
largely
turned
on
a
speech
which
he
made
on
the
floor
of
congress,
that
is
the
prosecution
with
respect
to
this,
there
was
also
another
count
of
a
conflict
of
interest
which
related
to
his
appearances
in
the
department
of
justice,
but
the
conspiracy
charge
related
to
a
speech
he
had
made
in
the
floor
of
congress
relating
to
building
and
loan
associations.
although
the
record
was
a
long
one
and
had
many
things
in
it,
50
pages
of
the
transcript
related
to
the
speech
in
the
case
presented
by
the
government
and
there
was
much
more
about
the
speech
in
the
presentation
of
the
defense.
the
government
indeed
introduced
a
copy
of
the
speech
in
evidence.
the
conspiracy
charge
was
that
the
speech
was
not
made
for
any
legislative
purpose,
but
was
made
by
congressman
johnson
for
fee
in
order
to
that
might
reprinted
and
distributed
to
prospective
depositors
so
as
to
encourage
them
to
make
deposits
in
maryland’s
savings
and
loan
associations.
it
is
also
relevant
i
think
that
the
indictment
contained
a
substantial
allegation
about
the
speech
and
this
was
reproduced
in
this
court’s
opinion
at
page
184,
at
paragraph
15,
i
read
from
the
opinion.
it
was
a
part
of
said
conspiracy
that
it
said,
thomas
f.
johnson
should
render
services
for
compensation
to
with
the
making
of
a
speech,
defending
the
operations
of
maryland’s
independent
savings
and
loan
associations,
the
financial
stability
insolvency
thereof
and
the
reliability
and
integrity
of
the
commercial
insurance
on
investments
made
by
said
independent
savings
and
loan
associations
on
the
floor
of
the
house
of
representatives.
thus,
that
was
a
central
part
of
the
actual
charge
in
that
case.
it
should
be
observed
too
that
the
court’s
opinion
is
narrowly
guarded.
on
page
184
of
the
opinion,
justice
harlan
said
near
the
top
of
the
page,
whatever
room
the
constitution
may
allow
for
such
factors
in
the
context
of
a
different
kind
of
prosecution
and
here
we
clearly
have
a
different
kind
of
prosecution
and
then
on
page
185,
justice
harlan
said
we
emphasize
that
our
holding
is
limited
to
prosecutions
involving
circumstances
such
as
those
presented
in
the
case
before
us
which
involved
extensive
utilization
of
the
central
factor
in
the
prosecution
of
the
making
of
a
speech.
and
the
court
said
we
expressly
leave
open
for
consideration
when
the
cases
arises,
a
prosecution
which
though
possibly
entailing
inquiring
into
legislative
acts
or
motivations
is
founded
on
a
narrowly
drawn
statute
passed
by
congress
in
the
exercise
of
its
legislative
part
to
regulate
the
conduct
of
its
members.
mr.
erwin
griswold
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
think
very
likely
not
because
of
the
extensive
use
of
the
speech.
it
is
a
little
hard
for
me
to
answer
it
because
the
very
fact
that
it
was
a
conspiracy
charge
and
that
you
would
then
been
had
to
allege
the
extensive
activities
to
support
the
conspiracy
is
part
of
what
brought
up
the
problem
and
i
would
agree
that
if
this
case
went
to
trial
and
we
ended
up
with
a
record
like
that
in
the
johnson
case
that
we
might
will
have
a
very
serious
problem.
it
will
not
be
my
responsibility
to
try
the
case.
mr.
erwin
griswold
mr.
justice
i
would
be
prepared
to
defend
that.
under
the
johnson
decision
it
is
a
more
difficult
case
than
we
have
here,
though
not
a
great
deal
more
difficult
because
this
one
refers
to
both.
mr.
erwin
griswold
no
mr.
justice.
i
think
the
court
has
at
times
equated
speeches.
mr.
erwin
griswold
mr.
justice
i
am
not
quite
going
to
accept
that
in
all
its
impact.
after
all,
the
speech
and
debate
clause
refers
only
to
speech
and
debate.
and
--
mr.
erwin
griswold
i
am
just
not
arguing
it.
i
recognize
that
it
is
closely
related,
but
some
of
the
talk
to
the
effect
that
some
of
the
references
in
the
opinions
to
the
effect
that
it
applies
to
both
says
well.
it
seems
to
me
to
be
an
example
of
that
well-known
circumstance
that
we
are
always
dealing
with
of
the
tendency
of
principles
to
expand
themselves
to
the
limit
of
their
logic.
and
all
that
i
need
to
say
here
is
that
the
johnson
case
involving
extensive
use
of
the
speech
which
is
precisely
what
the
constitution
refers
to,
speech
or
debate.
for
example,
there
are
other
extensions
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause
made
so
far
in
mr.
ramsey’s
brief
that
it
applies
to
any
activity
conducted
by
a
senator
or
congressman
in
connection
with
his
legislative
work
and
i
think
that
is
far
to
extensive.
now,
i
agree
that
the
line
between
vote
and
the
speech
is
pretty
small,
but
the
constitution
refers
only
to
speech
and
i
think
that
language
in
the
opinion
in
johnson
case
to
which
i
just
referred,
indicates
that
if
there
is
reference
to
a
vote,
but
it
is
incidental
and
then
sure
is
not
be
the
essence
of
the
charge
that
the
constitutional
provision
does
not
make
it
impossible
for
congress
to
allocate
the
determination
of
the
factual
matters
involved
with
respect
to
bribery
of
a
congress
or
senator
to
the
courts.
mr.
erwin
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
it
is
speech
or
debate
rather
than
speech
and
debate.
i
do
not
think
that
in
this
context
makes
any
difference.
i
would
suppose
that
if
they
had
wanted
to
say
vote,
it
might
have
occurred
to
somebody
before
any
speech,
debate
or
vote
in
either
house,
if
the
vote
is
expressly
left
out.
if
the
court
feels
that
the
speech
or
debate
clause
makes
it
impossible
for
congress
to
make
it
a
crime
for
a
congressman
to
accept
a
bribe
then
this
appeal
must
fail.
i
do
not
think
that
the
johnson
case
decided
that.
i
do
not
think
that
the
speech
or
debate
clause
requires
that
conclusion.
i
think
that
the
johnson
case
itself
expressly
left
this
question
open
and
indicated
that
under
a
properly
drawn
statute
the
mere
fact
that
was
some
reference
to
a
vote
was
not
fatal.
mr.
erwin
griswold
i
am
walking
right
up
to
that
mr.
justice.
i
agree
that
the
court
has
said
several
times
in
somewhat
sweeping
ways
that
it
goes
beyond
speech
or
debate.
however,
as
i
read
the
constitution,
what
the
constitution
says
is
speech
or
debate
and
i
still
find
some
difficulty
in
seeing
how
it
is
appropriate
to
construe
it
to
apply
to
other
things
than
speech
or
debate
and
i
know
of
no
case
where
the
court
has
so
decided.
mr.
erwin
griswold
well.
mr.
erwin
griswold
i
recall
that
and
it
is
there
and
that
i
am
not
contending
that
it
is
limited
to
speech
or
literally
to
speech.
i
am
perfectly
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
words
have
to
be
construed
in
a
broader
significance,
but
what
i
am
trying
to
maintain
is
that
the
mere
fact
that
there
is
a
reference
in
this
indictment
to
a
vote,
it
does
not
mean
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
this
--
the
charge
of
this
indictment
and
i
am
suggesting
that
the
court
has
never
so
decided.
mr.
erwin
griswold
well,
i
would
think
not
myself,
but
--
well,
let
me
modify
that.
i
think
of
course
that
a
congressman
or
senator
should
be
protected
against
suit
for
libel,
from
things
said
in
committee
hearing,
but
the
constitutional
provision
is
for
any
speech
or
debate
in
either
house.
we
do
not
have
that
issue
here.
i
repeat
i
think
that
some
of
the
language
in
some
of
the
cases
has
been
very
broad
and
that
there
are
no
decisions
on
such
matters
even
with
respect
to
what
is
said
in
committee
hearing,
but
it
is
not
--
there
is
nothing
about
a
committee
hearing
in
this
case,
it
is
not
necessary
to
decide
that.
i
would
like
in
the
brief
time
remaining
to
refer
to
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute
because
as
it
is
now
stands
it
is
in
some
what
broad
language.
this
is
the
statute
which
is
quoted
on
pages
2
and
3
of
our
brief.
it
refers
to
public
official
who
does
these
things
and
then
public
official
is
defined
to
include
member
of
congress.
this
is
not
brought
out
in
our
brief
and
i
would
like
an
opportunity
very
briefly
to
present
it.
the
history
of
the
statutory
provision
is
that
in
1853,
congress
enacted
a
statute
which
was
specifically
applicable
to
members
of
congress
who
take
bribes
and
to
take
bribes
with
intent
to
influence
his
vote
or
decision
on
any
question.
from
on
1853
on,
congress
has
specifically
provided
that
it
was
a
crime
for
a
congressman
or
the
senator
to
take
a
bribe
intended
to
influence
his
vote.
that
was
continued
in
the
revised
statutes
of
1874
and
1878.
it
was
continued
in
the
criminal
code
of
1908
and
it
was
in
effect
in
1962,
when
congress
passed
the
present
statute,
but
it
is
entirely
clear
that
in
enacting
the
present
statute
the
motivation
to
consolidate
a
lot
of
separate
bribery
provisions
dealing
with
public
officials
generally
came
from
congress,
not
from
the
executive.
there
was
a
report
by
a
staff
of
subcommittee
number
5
of
the
committee
on
judiciary
of
the
house
of
representatives
in
1958,
which
recommended
the
consolidation
of
these
provisions.
at
page
71
of
that
report
it
is
recommended
that
the
provisions
prohibiting
the
bribery
of
federal
employees,
members
of
congress
and
judges
and
judicial
officers
including
jurors
be
combined
in
a
single
statute
and
then
that
is
carried
forward
in
the
committee
reports,
senate
report
of
number
2213
in
the
87th
congress.
the
current
bribery
laws
consist
of
separate
sections
applicable
to
various
categories
or
persons,
government
employees,
members
of
congress,
judges
and
others.
section
201
would
bring
all
these
categories
within
the
purview
of
one
section
and
make
uniform
the
prescribed
act
of
bribery
as
well
as
the
intent
or
purpose
involved.
and
there
is
a
similar
provision
in
the
house
committee
report
which
is
house
report
number
748
in
the
87th
congress.
now,
whether
at
that
time
as
you
may
recall
a
considerable
development
of
thought
about
conflict
of
interest,
a
bill
with
respect
to
conflict
and
interest
came
before
congress
and
it
was
at
the
initiative
of
the
senate
judiciary,
of
the
house
judiciary
committee
that
these
provisions
with
respect
to
bribery
or
consolidated
and
introduced
in
the
same
bill.
and
i
think
it
is
perfectly
fair
to
say
that
this
statute
should
be
construed
in
the
light
of
its
clear
and
long
continued
history
as
one
which
in
part
at
least
is
focused
by
a
congress
on
the
actions
of
congressmen
and
senators
and
amounts
to
a
clear
declaration
by
congress
that
this
sort
of
conduct
should
be
tried
in
the
courts
with
the
procedural
safeguards
and
provisions
which
are
applicable
to
criminal
prosecutions
before
the
judiciary.
mr.
erwin
griswold
in
1962.
mr.
erwin
griswold
it
was
1958
that
the
house
committee
recommended
that
they
be
consolidated.
when
the
conflict
of
interest
statute
came
along,
that
was
put
in
as
a
part
of
it
and
it
was
in
1962
that
all
the
various
bribery
provisions
were
brought
together
into
a
single
statute
which
looks
quite
broad
as
it
is
now,
but
which
in
the
light
of
its
historical
background
is
it
seems
to
me
quite
narrowly
focused
in
this
application
on
bribery
of
congressmen
and
senators.
mr.
erwin
griswold
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
unless
this
court
is
prepared
to
hold
that
congress
has
no
constitutional
power
to
make
it
a
crime
for
a
congressman
or
senator
to
accept
a
bribe
for
any
sort
of
conduct
with
respect
to
his
legislative
responsibilities,
i
believe
that
this
judgment
should
be
reversed.
mr.
erwin
griswold
when
i
said
make
it
a
crime,
i
meant
a
crime
in
the
traditional
sense
by
indictment
by
a
grand
jury
and
prosecution
in
court.
there
is
not
any
doubt
that
either
house
has
the
power
to
subject
to
penalty
or
to
expel
a
member
who
does
anything
which
the
house
thinks
warrants
that.
there
is
a
further
problem
which
is
been
referred
to
in
the
cases
which
is
as
far
as
the
house
of
representatives
is
concerned,
imprisonment
can
extend
only
until
the
termination
of
that
session
of
the
house
and
that
if
the
bribery
was
not
found
until
in
the
old
days
that
is
2nd
of
march,
you
have
to
hold
the
trial
and
he
would
be
release
on
the
04th
of
march
whenever
the
congress
expires.
moreover,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
the
practical
problems
with
respect
to
trial
of
these
matters
before
the
house
or
the
senate
are
difficult.
a
fair
trial
of
one
of
these
matters
might
be
complicated,
might
take
the
time
for
a
month
of
the
congressman
and
the
senators
and
i
repeat,
if
congress
chooses
to
allocate
that
to
the
regular
courts,
unless
the
court
is
prepared
to
hold
that
congress
cannot
constitutionally
do
that,
this
judgment
should
be
reversed.
i
would
repeat
--
mr.
erwin
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice
that.
mr.
erwin
griswold
that
is
true
and
that
point
is
made
that
with
respect
to
the
contempt
of
a
witness
that
it
does
require
a
resolution
of
the
house
on
recommendation
from
the
committee
before
it
goes
to
the
executive
for
proper
action
--
mr.
erwin
griswold
and
that
is
not
required
in
this
instance.
mr.
erwin
griswold
it
would
be
our
position
that
the
executive
could
go
ahead
under
this
statute
and
i
repeat
our
position
is
that
unless
the
court
is
prepared
to
hold,
that
congress
has
no
constitutional
power
to
make
it
a
crime
for
a
congressman
or
senator
to
accept
a
bribe
for
a
legislative
conduct,
this
judgment
should
be
reversed.
let
me
refer
to
the
fact
that
the
statute
in
this
case
as
it
now
stands
makes
no
reference
whatever
to
vote.
it
simply
says,
if
before
him
in
his
official
capacity
and
though
i
do
not
need
to
go
so
far,
i
think
that
a
conviction
could
be
sustained
under
this
indictment
without
any
showing
as
to
how
a
senator
brewster
voted
on
any
matter
or
indeed
without
any
evidence
that
he
voted
at
all.
finally,
i
would
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
there
was
a
concurring
opinion
in
the
johnson
case
by
chief
justice
warren
and
in
which
justices
brennan
and
douglas
concurred,
which
proceeded
on
the
narrow
ground
of
the
extensive
use
of
the
speech
in
that
case,
thus
there
is
nothing
there
decided
beyond
that
by
anything
except
a
four
to
three
decision
and
our
position
is
that
the
problem
of
this
case
was
not
only
expressly
left
open,
but
a
considerable
intimation
that
the
court
did
not
think
that
it
should
go
as
far
in
construing
this
rather
simple
language
of
the
speech
and
debate
clause
as
to
make
it
impossible
for
congress
by
statute
to
make
it
a
crime
for
a
congressman
or
senator
to
accept
the
bribe.
mr.
erwin
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
reargument.
it
is
a
direct
appeal
from
a
decision
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
dismissing
an
indictment
on
constitutional
grounds.
the
indictment
appears
beginning
on
page
1
of
the
appendix.
it
consists
of
nine
counts
or
ten
counts.
the
odd
numbered
ones
of
which
relate
to
the
defendant
former
senator
brewster.
the
even
numbered
counts
are
not
before
the
court
at
all
and
the
first
count
may
be
taken
as
for
the
purposes
of
this
appeal
as
typical
of
the
rest
raising
the
question
which
was
decided.
the
first
allegation
in
the
account
is
that
at
all
times
here
after
mentioned
in
this
indictment,
daniel
b.
brewster
was
a
public
official
that
is
a
member
of
the
senate
of
the
untied
states
from
the
state
of
maryland.
and
then
over
on
page
2
of
the
indictment
are
the
principal
allegation
of
the
first
count
is
that
daniel
b.
brewster
being
a
public
official,
acting
for
and
on
behalf
thereof
directly
and
indirectly
corruptly
as
solicited,
sought,
accepted,
received
and
agreed
to
receive
the
sum
of
$5,000.00
for
himself
and
for
an
entity
in
return
for
being
influenced
in
his
performance
of
official
acts
in
respect
to
his
action,
route
and
decision
on
postage
rate
legislation
which
might
at
any
time
be
pending
before
him
in
his
official
capacity
and
in
his
place
of
trust
and
profit
in
violation
of
section
201
(c)
(1)
and
2,
title
18,
united
states
code.
after
the
indictment
was
found,
defendant
through
his
counsel
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment.
in
fact
two
motions
dismissed,
but
the
only
one
that’s
here
is
the
one
which
appears
on
page
8
of
the
appendix.
and
the
motion
to
dismiss,
the
odd
numbered
counts
of
the
indictment
was
on
the
ground
that
in
each
such
count,
the
defendant
is
charged
with
being
influenced
in
his
performance
of
official
acts
in
his
capacity
as
a
united
states
senator.
and
then
finally
the
third
reason
of
the
motion
to
dismiss
each
count
of
the
indictment
as
charged
against
this
defendant
violates
the
provision
of
article
1,
section
6
of
the
united
states
constitution
which
is
the
speech
and
debate
clause
which
it
will
be
remembered,
said
in
in
rather
simple
terms
that
for
any
speech
or
debate
in
either
house
senators
or
representatives
shall
not
be
questioned
in
any
other
place.
the
language,
the
important
language
here
is,
in
a
speech
or
debate
in
either
house.
and
then
the
order
of
the
court
from
which
this
appeal
is
taken
appears
on
page
34
of
the
appendix
ordered
that
the
defendant's
motion
be
granted
and
the
indictment
be
and
hereby
is
dismissed
as
to
the
defendant
brewster
for
the
reason
stated
orally
by
the
court
at
the
hearing
on
october
9,
1970.
and
those
reasons
appear
on
the
preceding
page,
page
33
where
the
court
said,
“gentleman,
based
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
it
is
admitted
by
the
government
that
the
five
counts
of
the
indictment
which
charge
senator
brewster
relate
to
the
acceptance
of
bribes
in
connection
with
the
performance
of
a
legislative
function
by
a
senator
of
the
united
states.”
now
i
suggest
that
that’s
simply
a
paraphrase
of
exactly
what
the
indictment
says.
and
then
it
is
the
opinion
of
the
court
that
the
immunity
under
the
speech
and
debate
clause
of
the
constitution,
particularly
in
view
of
the
interpretation
given
that
clause
by
the
supreme
court
in
johnson’s
shields
senator
brewster,
constitutionally
shields
him
from
any
prosecution
for
alleged
bribery
to
perform
a
legislative
act.
the
question
of
the
jurisdiction
of
this
appeal
has
been
deferred
to
the
hearing
of
the
merits
of
--
i
find
it
myself
somewhat
difficult
to
see
that
there
is
doubt
as
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
appeal.
this
arises
under
the
old
version
of
the
criminal
appeal’s
act,
since
the
indictment
was
found
here
before
january
1971
and
it
seems
to
us
that
this
appeal
comes
under
two
of
the
clauses
of
that
statute.
there
is
a
suggestion
in
mr.
ramsey’s
brief
that
for
some
reason
the
statute
is
not
applicable
because
of
a
reference
to
a
conference
memorandum
which
was
said
to
be
before
the
judge.
it
is
not
in
the
appendix.
i
have
never
seen
it.
i
would
like
to
suggest
that
with
respect
to
it
that
there
is
no
procedure
for
summary
judgment
in
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
i
think
that
there
is
a
sort
of
spillover
here
because
we're
familiar
with
the
summary
judgment
and
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
that
this
is
in
some
way
a
decision
on
a
summary
judgment,
but
i
know
of
no
procedure
and
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure
for
summary
judgment.
and
then
i
would
like
to
suggest
and
mr.
ramsey
says
that
this
was
the
equivalent
of
an
acquittal.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
no
jury
had
been
impaneled,
no
trial
had
been
commenced,
and
i
would
like
to
suggest
that
as
far
as
anything
that
i
have
heard
of
in
the
law
of
criminal
procedure,
so
far
there
cannot
be
an
acquittal,
except
at
a
trial
that
is
until
a
jury
has
been
impaneled.
now,
this
becomes
a
little
complicated
in
the
case
of
a
trial
without
jury,
but
i
still
suggest
that
there
cannot
be
an
acquittal
without
a
trial
that
is
that
the
commencement
of
trial
without
a
jury
is
a
rather
formal
act,
likely
impaneling
of
a
jury
and
requires
among
other
things
that
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
has
been
waived.
there
was
no
such
waiver
here
and
there
was
no
trial.
there
cannot
be
double
jeopardy
until
there
has
been
jeopardy.
i
hear
no
jury
had
been
empanelled
and
jeopardy
had
not
attached.
i
would
like--in
closing
the
jurisdictional
part
of
my
argument
to
refer
to
decisions
of
this
court,
which
are
not
cited
in
my
brief.
one
of
them,
the
first
of
them
is
cited
in
an
early
brief
of
mr.
ramsey,
though
for
another
point.
that
is
the
case
of
united
states
against
fruehauf
in
365
u.s.
where
the
situation
is
almost
exactly
parallel
to
that
here.
there
had
been
memoranda
before
the
district
court.
there
was
a
direct
appeal
to
this
court
under
the
criminal
appeals
act.
if
the
position
taken
now
by
mr.
ramsey
is
correct,
even
assuming
that
the
conference
memorandum
to
which
he
refers
is
a
part
of
the
record
here
that
appeal
should
have
been
dismissed
on
the
ground
that
there
had
been
a
decision
under
summary
judgment
or
an
acquittal.
that
the
decision
--
not
only
that
appeal,
not
only
was
not
dismissed,
but
the
case
was
sent
back
to
the
district
court
for
trial.
and
then
another
case
which
is
not
cited
in
our
brief,
but
it
is
so
closely
parallel
that
i
think
it
is
appropriate
to
mention
in
here,
united
states
against
halseth,
that
is
342
u.s.
277,
where
it
appeared
that
there
had
been
stipulation
in
the
district
court.
and
there
again,
if
the
decision
of
the
court
with
respect
to
that
stipulation
had
amounted
to
an
acquittal
or
a
decision
on
a
summary
judgment,
the
appeal
should
have
been
dismissed,
but
the
appeal
was
not
dismissed.
both
of
these
cases
are
discussed
in
mr.
justice
harlan’s
opinion
in
the
united
states
against
sisson
in
399
u.s.
but
i
would
point
out
that
the
sisson
case
is
clearly
inapplicable
here
because
there
had
been
a
full
trial
and
the
judges’
decision
which
amounted
to
the
entry
of
a
judgment,
not
withstanding
the
verdict
was
based
on
facts
which
appeared
at
the
trial.
thus,
jeopardy
had
attached
and
the
basis
for
an
appeal
was
removed
as
was
held
in
the
simmons
case
itself.
now,
turning
to
the
merits
here,
the
case
is
of
course
the
step
beyond
the
court’s
decision
in
united
states
against
johnson
which
was
decided
some
six
years
ago.
the
appellee
relies
on
the
johnson
decision,
but
i
think
that
it
is
by
its
own
terms
inapplicable
here.
with
the
benefit
of
hindsight,
one
can
say
that
the
johnson
case
was
an
unfortunate
case
to
bring
before
the
court.
the
charge
there
was
under
the
conspiracy
statute
which
is
a
very
general
statute.
while
the
charge
here
is
under
a
bribery
statute,
one
which
with
respect
to
congressmen
and
senators
has
a
continuous
history
going
back
to
1853,
119
years
during
which
time
congress
has
expressly
said
that
when
a
congressman
or
a
senator
accepts
a
bribe,
he
should
be
subject
to
prosecution
through
the
regular
procedures
of
the
criminal
courts.
but
in
the
johnson
case
as
well,
not
much
concern
was
given
about
the
speech
or
debate
clause
in
initiating
the
prosecution
or
in
carrying
it
out.
in
that
case,
the
indictment
contained
a
specific
reference
to
the
speech
and
debate
clause
which
was
quoted
at
some
length
in
the
court’s
opinion.
this
is
on
page
184
and
paragraph
15
of
the
indictment
said
it
was
party
said
conspiracy
that
the
said
thomas
f.
johnson
should
render
services
for
compensation
to
whip
the
making
of
a
speech
defending
the
operations
of
maryland
saving
loan
associations
and
so
on.
mr.
erwin
griswold
i
do
not
recall
mr.
chief
justice.
i
do
not
believe
that
it
appears
anywhere
in
the
opinion
of
this
court.
i
have
not
searched
through
the
record
as
to
what
was
done
in
the
district
court.
not
only
was
this
in
the
indictment,
but
at
the
trial
itself,
some
50
pages
of
the
transcript
related
to
the
speech
in
the
case
presented
by
the
government
and
having
been
so
opened
up
by
the
government,
there
was
much
more
about
the
speech
in
the
presentation
of
the
defense.
the
government
introduced
a
copy
of
the
speech
in
evidence
and
devoted
substantial
argument
to
the
preposition
that
the
nature
of
the
conspiracy
was
that
the
speech
should
be
delivered
in
order
that
it
could
be
reprinted
and
distributed
among
appropriate
persons
in
maryland.
now,
with
respect
to
the
johnson
case.
it
is
very
significant
that
the
opinion
was
narrowly
guarded
on
page
184
of
the
opinion.
the
court
said,
"whatever
room
the
constitution
may
allow
for
such
factors
in
the
context
of
a
different
kind
of
prosecution."
and
this
of
course
is
a
bribery
prosecution,
not
a
conspiracy
prosecution.
and
then
on
page
185,
the
court
said,
"we
emphasize
that
our
holding
is
limited
to
prosecutions
involving
circumstances
as
those
presented
in
the
case
before
us.
we
expressly
leave
open
for
consideration
when
the
case
arises
a
prosecution
which
though
possibly
entailing
inquiry
in
the
legislative
acts
on
motivations
is
founded
upon
a
nearly
drawn
statute
passed
by
congress
in
the
exercise
of
its
legislative
power
to
regulate
the
conduct
of
its
members."
then
i
think
it’s
not
irrelevant
to
point
out
those
three
members
of
the
court,
chief
justice
warren
and
justices
douglas
and
brennan
concurred
only
in
the
limited
holding
of
the
court
that
the
use
of
the
congressman
speech
during
this
particular
trial
within
examination
into
its
authorship,
motivation
and
content,
it
was
violative
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
two
members
of
the
court
took
no
part
in
the
case,
so
that
there
were
only
four
justices
who
concurred
in
anything
broader
than
the
limited
holding
referred
to
in
chief
justice
warren’s
opinion.
now,
there’s
nothing
like
this
in
this
case.
there
is
no
speech
at
all.
indeed
as
i’ve
indicated,
there’s
no
evidence
before
the
court,
there
was
no
examination
into
the
authorship,
motivation
and
content
of
any
speech.
there
is
a
reference
in
each
count
to
the
effect
that
senator
brewster
is
charged
with
taking
a
bribe
and
i
quote
“in
return
for
being
influenced
in
his
performance
of
official
acts
in
respect
of
to
his
action,
vote
and
decision
on
postage
rate
legislation.”
mr.
erwin
griswold
i
think
not
mr.
chief
justice
if
the
defendant
was
the
one
who
brought
that
out.
i
am
a
little
concerned
if
the
prosecution
relies
on
a
vote.
mr.
erwin
griswold
if
the
defendant
brings
it
out,
i
assume
he
can
waive
–-
well
i
don’t
know,
it
says,
shall
not
be
questioned
unless
he
relies
on
it.
i
find
it
hard
to
see
how
he
can
complain
that
he
is
being
questioned.
i
would
think
certainly
under
the
johnson
case,
it
is
clear
that
the
government
cannot
maintain
the
prosecution
if
it
relies
directly
on
the
giving
of
a
speech.
there
is
some
reference
in
the
opinion
to
tangential
use.
i
do
not
quite
know
just
what
tangential
use
means.
i
would
think
that
it
might
perhaps
be
within
that
language
if
it
were
shown
that
there
was
a
speech,
but
if
the
text
of
the
speech
was
not
relied
on
and
if
the
motivation
and
authorship
of
the
speech
were
not
gone
into.
but
i
would
suggest
mr.
chief
justice
that
this
indictment
at
this
stage
can
be
sustained
without
answering
these
questions.
i
don’t
know
just
where
the
line
is.
i
know
that
the
constitution
says
speech
or
debate
in
either
house
and
i
don’t
think
that
is
broad
enough
or
ought
to
be
held
to
be
broad
enough
to
cover
things
which
occur
outside
of
sessions
of
the
house
which
might
be
construed
to
include
sessions
of
committees.
committee
may
be
for
this
purpose
is
something
done
in
the
house.
it
doesn’t
say
both,
but
i
am
troubled
about
vote
and
there
are
opinions
of
the
court
which
have
indicated,
though
i
do
not
think
actually
decided
that
vote
may
be
enough.
but
this
indictment
charges
him
of
receiving
a
bribe
for
being
influenced
in
his
performance
of
official
acts.
in
respect
to
his
action,
vote
and
decision,
on
postage
rate
legislation
or
i
suppose
we
strikeout
votes,
supposed
we
say
that
can’t
be
referred
to,
i
don’t
conceded
that,
but
let’s
strike
it
out.
there
is
still
plenty
in
this
indictment
and
the
evidence
of
the
trial
may
show
nothing
relating
to
a
vote.
there
is
no
charge
with
respect
to
his
speech
which
is
the
only
thing
to
which
the
johnson
case
applies.
and
unless
the
court
is
prepared
to
hold
that
nothing
that
a
senator
does
as
a
senator
can
be
questioned
in
any
other
place
under
the
speech
and
debate
clause,
a
result
prior
beyond
anything
that
has
ever
yet
been
decided.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
no
basis
for
holding
that
this
indictment
of
itself
without
any
evidence
is
in
violation
of
the
speech
and
debate
clause.
our
position
--
mr.
erwin
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice
marshall.
it
would
be
our
position
that
the
crime
is
committed
when
the
bribe
is
either
solicited
or
received.
he
doesn’t
have
to
receive
it
with
the
requisite
intent
and
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
prove
that
there
was
in
fact
any
legislative
act
of
any
kind.
and,
i
think
that
becomes
quite
clear
when
you
consider
the
solicitation
language
in
the
statute
ask,
demands,
seeks,
solicits
any
bribe
it
would
not
be
possible
to
prosecute
the
solicitation
of
a
bribe
if
the
other
construction
of
the
statute
is
taken
until
you
waited
to
see
whether
he
did
something.
and
as
i
have
tried
to
develop
in
the
supplemental
brief
which
we
have
filed,
i
think
that
a
prosecution
under
this
statute
can
be
maintained
and
that
the
indictment
is
sufficient
without
the
showing
of
any
speech
or
debate
of
any
kind,
without
the
showing
of
any
action.
if
there
is
evidence
which
can
show
that
at
the
time
he
solicited
or
received
the
bribe,
he
intended
to
take
legislative
action
in
accordance
with
the
bribes
request.
mr.
erwin
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
seems
to
me
that
mr.
ramsey
unduly
treats
legislative
act
as
synonymous
with
and
absolutely
the
equivalent
of
speech
or
debate.
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution
which
relates
and
which
refers
in
anyway
to
legislative
acts
and
we
submit
that
there
are
many
acts
which
a
legislator
may
do
and
may
properly
do
as
a
legislator
which
are
appropriate
for
a
congressman
or
senator
to
do
which
are
customarily
done
by
congressman
or
senators
which
are
not
speech
or
debate
and
which
are
not
within
the
protection
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
if
the
court
should
reach
the
conclusion
that
the
speech
or
debate
clause
protects
a
congressman
or
senator
with
respect
to
anything
that
he
does
after
he
takes
the
oath
of
office,
our
case
would
be
difficult.
although,
as
mr.
justice
marshall
has
suggested,
it
is
very
hard
to
accept
the
conclusion
that
taking
a
bribe
is
a
legislative
act
even
within
a
very
broad
definition
of
that
term.
as
we
see
in
this
case,
the
case
can
be
proved
without
bringing
in
to
question
any
legislative
act,
any
speech
or
debate,
the
only
word
in
the
indictment
which
gives
me
any
pause
at
all
is
the
word
“vote.”
if
the
word
vote
were
not
there,
if
we
now
excise
it,
we
make
no
use
of
it,
i
can
find
that
nothing
in
the
indictment
which
is
in
anyway
in
conflict
with
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
it
is
suggested,
turning
to
another
matter,
that
the
matter
of
punishing
a
senator
who
takes
the
bribe
is
by
the
constitution
committed
solely
to
that
house
of
congress
and
that
congress
has
a
legislative
body,
has
no
power
to
deal
with
that.
i
should
think
that
that
was
adequately
disposed
off
by
this
court’s
decision
in
the
burton
case,
some
60
years
ago,
where
a
congressman
was
convicted
under
a
statute
for
taking
fees
in
connection
with
appearances
before
the
executive
branch
of
the
government.
and
more
recently
in
powell
against
mccormick
where
a
similar
argument
has
made,
that
the
power
of
congress
of
the
house
or
the
senate
to
exclude
was
exclusive
and
that
prevented
the
court
from
giving
a
declaratory
judgment
on
the
matter.
both
of
those
cases
seem
to
me
to
dispose
of
that
contention.
and
then
finally,
as
has
been
suggested
in
the
argument,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
--
or
our
position
is
here,
that
the
offense
was
committed
when
the
bribe
was
solicited
or
taken
with
the
requisite
intent.
it
is
immaterial
thereafter,
whether
any
action
including
even
any
legislative
action
that
short
of
speech
or
debate
was
done.
the
argument
is
that
rather
similar
to
that
which
was
rejected
in
the
case
in
the
second
circuit
involving
judge
matten,
or
a
part
of
the
defense
was--it's
a
different
statute,
the
case
is
not
controlling
but
the
analogy
is
close.
part
of
the
defense
was
that
though
we
took
the
bribe,
it
didn’t
influences
decisions
that
all
of
the
cases
were
decided
right
and
a
part
of
the
charge
which
was
sought
to
be
submitted
to
the
jury
there
was,
that
if
the
case
where
decided
right,
and
then
he
could
not
be
convicted.
that
was--the
argument
that
was
rejected
by
court
of
appeals
which
mr.
justice
sutherland
sat
and
that
the
decision
was
that
the
taking
in
the
bribe
completed
the
offense
and
it
was
not
necessary
to
show
that
the
promised
action
was
carried
out.
similarly
here,
the
taking
of
the
bribe,
at
least
for
the
record
was
an
intent,
is
the
essence
and
the
substance
of
the
offense
and
as
we
see
it,
it
is
not
necessary
to
prove
certainly
any
speech
or
debate
in
order
to
maintain
the
prosecution
accordingly.
we
think
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
