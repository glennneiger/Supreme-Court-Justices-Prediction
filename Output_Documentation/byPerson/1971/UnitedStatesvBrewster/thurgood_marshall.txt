justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
ramsey,
did
he
give
a
stipulation
or
did
he
give
his
interpretation
of
what
the
indictment
said?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
so
far
as
i
am
concerned,
if
the
memorandum
is
not
in
this
record,
i
am
not
interested
in
it,
at
least
for
this
question?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
he
did
not
mention
a
memorandum
in
that
statement,
did
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
what
you
read
us,
he
did
not
mention
the
memorandum,
did
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
was
he
not
merely
stating
what
his
opinion
was
of
what
was
in
the
indictment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
are
talking
about
this
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
ramsey.
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
a
senator
or
congressman
accepts
$5,000.00
of
pay
to
speak
and
vote
for
a
piece
of
legislation
and
another
5,000
would
be
to
speak
against
and
vote
against
the
piece
of
legislation
and
goes
fishing.
do
you
think
its
bribery?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
would
he
be
disciplined
in
the
house,
for
going
fishing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
solicitor
general,
the
difference
in
those
speech
involved
in
act
and
wouldn’t
it
be
true
that
if
the
senator
took
the
$5,000.00
and
the
next
day
the
bill
was
withdrawn
from
congress,
he
couldn’t
have
voted
or
done
anything
on.
he
would
still
be
getting
[voice
overlap]
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what
phase
of
legislative
conduct
is
the
taking
of
a
bribe?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what
has
speech
and
debate
got
to
do
with
taking
a
bribe?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
speech
or
debate
mentioned
in
the
indictment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
does
the
word
speech
or
debate
or
anything
closely
resembling
it
in
the
indictment
which
is
the
one
thing
that
we
have
before
us?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that’s
all
we
have
[voice
overlap]
is
that
he
took
a
bribe,
even
if
he
never
made
a
speech
about
anything.
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
in
understand,
your
position
when
the
member
of
congress
takes
a
bribe
of
any
amount
of
money
and
then
makes
a
speech,
he
is
in
a
different
category
from
anybody
else
in
the
united
states?
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
he
raise
that
if
he
doesn’t
make
a
speech?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
far
as
i
am
concerned,
my
ambit
of
speech
and
debate
at
least
stops
at
the
bribe.[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
is
like
a
freedom
of
speech
case.
a
man
has
a
right
of
freedom
of
speech
but
that
doesn't
give
him
the
right
to
act
illegally.
and
this
is
the
act
solely,
the
act
of
taking
a
bribe.
that’s
the
only
thing
involved
in
this
case.
and
don’t
you
agree
that
that
point
was
left
opened
in
johnson?
justice
thurgood
marshall
on
the
facts
of
this
case
is
an
allegation
in
the
indictment
that
he
did
vote
that
way?
no?
it’s
nothing
in
there
that
says
--
am
i
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
unless
it’s
before
us.
is
the
indictment
was
before
us.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
indictment
is
all
we
have?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
the
indictment
covered
what
he
said
he
was
going
to
do.
the
indictment
did
not
say
he
did
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
the
senator
had
taken
money,
$5,000.00
from
each
side,
would
he
be
covered?
justice
thurgood
marshall
couldn’t’
it
be
that
under
johnson,
all
that
government
had
to
prove
was
that
he
took
a
bribe
for
the
expressed
promise
of
doing
something
and
that
was
the
crime.
regardless
of
what
he
did
thereat.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
i
said
that
was
left
open
in
johnson.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what
is
the
crime
he
is
being
charged
with?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
about
the
bribery?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
what
did
the
government
have
to
show
us
then
that
he
took
the
money
for
the
purpose
of
promises
to
do
so?
what
else
has
the
government
have
to
prove?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
else
that
the
government
have
to
prove?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
was
for
that
purpose?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that’s
all
the
government
has
to
prove?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
only
speech
that
government
has
to
show
is
that
senator
jones'
speech
was,
"give
me
$5,000.00
and
i’ll
vote
the
way
you
want
me
to
vote."
that
is
not
the
time
speech
i
think
is
covered.
justice
thurgood
