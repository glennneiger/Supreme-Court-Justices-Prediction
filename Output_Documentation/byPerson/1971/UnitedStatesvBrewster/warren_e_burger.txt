the
--
excuse
me
mr.
solicitor
general
the
orders
have
been
duly
filed
and
certified
as
you
know
and
will
not
otherwise
be
announced.
mr.
solicitor
general
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
conjunction
of
the
terms
of
speech
and
debate
in
the
constitution
indicate
that
it
is
speeches
in
the
congress
on
the
floor,
the
debates
in
the
congress
on
the
floor
that
is
being
talked
about
or
is
it
broader
than
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
think
that
speech
or
debate
reach
speaking
and
utterance
in
a
committee
hearing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
solicitor
general.
before
you
proceed
mr.
ramsey,
let
me
correct
one
impression
for
those
who
are
defending
on
the
order
list.
the
order
list
this
week
will
come
down
on
tuesday,
tomorrow
and
not
today.
mr.
ramsey,
we
will
enlarge
your
time
by
5
minutes
which
will
give
the
solicitor
general
a
few
moments,
few
minutes
rebuttal
time.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(voice
overlap)
five
minutes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
mr.
ramsey,
i
am
looking
at
page
2
of
the
appendix
now
of
the
indictment,
just
above
the
middle
of
page,
the
indictment
charges
in
return
for
being
influenced
in
his
performance
of
official
act
in
respect
to
his
action,
vote
and
decision
on
postage
rate
legislation
which
might
at
any
time
be
pending
before
him
in
his
official
capacity.
now
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
how
would
any
details
of
this
so
called
bill
of
particulars
be
basically
different
from
that
except
to
pinpoint
the
particular
day
or
hour
or
what
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
difficulty
seeing
how
the
power
or
the
day
actually
enlarges
what
is
already
said
in
the
indictment
so
far
as
the
constitutional
provision
is
concerned
or
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
ramsey.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
your
answer
or
your
position
be
essentially
the
same
if
the
bribe
had
been
given
to
a
number
--
for
the
explicit
comments
not
to
vote
and
not
to
make
a
speech.
that
is,
suppose
he
were
an
opponent
to
the
legislation
and
the
money
were
paid
with
a
negative,
instead
of
the
positive
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
stay
away,
to
absent
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
ramsey.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
do
not
know
where
this
analogy
would
be
helpful
or
not,
but
let
me
try
it.
suppose
a
senator
or
a
member
of
either
house
was
charged,
not
with
receiving
a
bribe
in
relation
to
his
official
conduct,
but
with
paying
a
bribe
to
another
member
not
in
the
house,
but
downtown
at
a
hotel
or
in
a
restaurant,
would
you
say
that
he
was
immune
to
prosecution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
do
not
suggest
that
there
is
--
that
the
element
of
official
conduct
or
conduct
within
the
scope
of
his
office
is
involved
when
he
is
a
disperser
of
the
money
rather
than
a
receiver,
do
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
far
would
you
carry
these
terms
or
other
comments,
mr.
ramsey?
you
remember
historically
years
ago
more
or
less
some
members
of
the
congress
struck
each
other,
challenged
each
other
to
duels,
actually
shot
each
other,
is
there
immunity
from
constitution
there
across
the
board?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
question
is,
is
it
beyond
the
power
of
the
executive?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
it
just
to
pursue
that
one
hypothetical
that
you
have
conceded
that
if
one
member
arranged
to
kidnap
or
otherwise
coerce
a
member
from
going
to
the
floor
to
vote,
he
did
this
downtown
that
that
would
be
subject
to
ordinary
prosecutions,
criminal
prosecutions,
conduct
the
house,
but
that
if
he
hands
in
an
envelope
with
a
lot
of
money
in
it
to
do
the
same
thing
that
somehow
then
becomes
connected
with
official
duty?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
us
just
make
it
a
threat
then,
a
threat
of
physical
violence,
not
the
actual
physical
violence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
threatenor
and
the
bribor,
the
man
who
was
threatening
or
giving
the
bribe
not
the
receiver?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
ramsey.
mr.
solicitor
general
you
have
about
three
minutes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
solicitor
general.
thank
you
mr.
ramsey.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
number
70-45,
united
states
against
brewster.
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
solicitor
general,
do
you
recall
whether
in
the
johnson
case,
there
was
a
motion
in
the
trial
court
challenging
the
indictment
on
that
specific
ground?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
solicitor
general,
supposed
under
this
indictment
case
were
tried
and
the
defendant
established
that
he
voted
not
at
all
absented
himself
or
abstained
or
voted
contrary
to
the
agreement
charge
with
that
--
if
never
the
less
a
bribe
had
been
paid
would
that
undermine
the
case,
the
government’s
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
assuming
the
defendant
would
be
the
one
who
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
ramsey.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you’re
saying
it
was
not
decided
on
the
indictment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
the
indictment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
is
it
not
a
routine
function
of
congressman
to
advocate
propositions
and
to
importune
officers
of
the
executive
branch
to
do
one
thing
or
another
for
their
constituents?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i’m
speaking
of
the
factual
matter,
isn’t
that--?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
you
spoke,
mr.
ramsey,
of
some
of
these
hypothetical
situations
not
being
before
the
court,
the
district
court,
which
is
of
course
true,
but
that’s
because,
in
part,
no
evidence
was
taken.
the
case
never
reached
that
point,
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
we’ll
never
know
what
the
government
would
rest
its
case
on
unless
there
is
a
trial,
will
we?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
ramsey,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
mr.
ramsey,
that
language
that
you
just
alluded
to
or
paraphrased
from
the
johnson
opinion,
wherein
the
context
of
a
discussion
of
an
alleged
payment
for
making
a
speech
on
the
floor
of
the
house

quite
a

with
it,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.

and
in
those
particular
remarks,
i
think
were
addressed
to
that
general
problem,
were
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
this
court
did
not
want
to
try
to
make
the
evaluation,
the
fact
evaluation
of
whether
the
speech
on
floor
of
the
house
had
influence
the
verdict
as
distinguished
from
other
things
that

johnson
had
done,
isn’t
that
correct?
