isn’t
the
logical
import
vote
of
judge
hart’s
ruling
below
and
of
your
argument
here
that
congress
cannot,
under
any
circumstances,
provide
with
the
a
judicial
prosecution
of
the
taking
of
a
bribe
by
a
member
of
congress?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
sort
of
a
situation
would
that
be
consistent
with
your
own
position?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
mean
that
there
would
be
a
permission
for
the
government
to
prove
an
agreement
of
the
nature
you’ve
just
described
so
long
as
there’s
no
need
to
any
inquiry
whether
it
was
performed
or
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
take
your
first
case
where
you
say
he
took
a
bribe
and
did
nothing,
certainly
bribes
aren’t
given
without
some
contractual
understanding
of
a
performance.
even
in
your
first
case
where
he
did
nothing,
there
would
have
to
be
in
an
agreement
by
him
to
do
something
and
it
would
not
be
a
bribe
as
one
commonly
understands.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
we
got
to
apply
some
sort
of
a
rational
standard
that
is
capable
of
being
applied
not
just
to
this
case
but
to
other
cases
too
in
order
to
reach
a
result,
don’t
we?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
ramsey?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
could
it
not
that
be
treated
simply
as
a
matter
of
privilege
that
is
forbid
the
inquiry
if
one
seeks
to
make
the
inquiry
during
the
trial
rather
than
throw
out
the
whole
case?
