mr.
edward
m.
genson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
grant
of
certiorari
in
the
instant
case
is
limited
to
the
single
question
whether
coleman
versus
alabama
is
retroactive
and
applicable
to
the
instant
case
were
prior
to
trial.
the
defendant
objected
to
the
failure
to
provide
counsel
at
a
preliminary
hearing.
it
is
our
position
that
the
state
does
not
have
standing
or
right,
to
argue
reliance
or
non-retroactivity.
in
a
case
where
the
error
was
pointed
out
to
the
state
by
the
defendant
prior
to
the
trial
to
the
court
and
the
state
ignored
the
plea
proceeding
to
trial.
the
case
of
linkletter
versus
walker
established
the
criteria
for
determining
whether
a
rule
should
be
or
should
not
be
retroactive.
the
reasons
and
the
criteria
were
the
purposes
to
be
served
by
the
new
rule,
the
reliance
on
the
old
rule
and
the
effect
of
the
new
rule
--
the
retroactivity,
retroactive
application
of
the
new
rule
on
the
administration
of
justice.
the
purpose
of
the
rule
in
coleman
as
i
see
it
is
to
enhance
the
integrity
of
the
fact
finding
process
and
thy
doing
this
by
providing
a
lawyer
at
the
preliminary
hearing
which
in
illinois
is
a
very
critical
stage
of
the
proceeding
and
a
very
vital
stage
of
the
proceeding
in
the
prosecution
of
a
defendant.
the
value
of
counsel
at
a
preliminary
hearing
in
illinois
is
immeasurable.
the
attorney
as
pointed
out
in
coleman
can
use
the
impeachment
tool
later
at
trial.
he
can
fashion
his
tool
and
this
would
be
something
--
would
be
impossible
to
do
without
an
attorney
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
as
justice
schauer
pointed
out
in
his
dissent
in
bonner,
bonner
is
one
of
the
cases
in
illinois
that
established
the
preliminary
hearing
not
to
be
a
critical
stage.
in
that
case
where
there
was
no
counsel
the
witness
testified
against
the
defendant
in
response
to
leading
questions
by
the
prosecutor
in
the
court.
he
was
not
advising
my
co-witnesses
on
his
own
behalf,
he
did
not
testify.
he
was
not
advised
that
witnesses
could
be
excluded
or
kept
separate
during
examination.
he
was
not
advised
at
the
preliminary
hearing
and
illinois
can
be
used
to
perpetuate
testimony
which
is
specific
in
the
statute.
i
differ
with
the
respondent’s
analogy
of
stovall
versus
denno
and
coleman
as
i
can
contemplate
a
fair
wind
up
without
an
attorney
present
but
how
might
a
preliminary
hearing
be
there
without
an
attorney.
this
is
an
adversary
proceeding.
in
this
particular
case,
in
the
instant
case
not
one
question
was
asked
by
the
defendant,
not
one
witness
was
called
by
the
defendant.
the
insufficiencies
or
whatever
insufficiencies
that
there
might
have
been
indicate
for
the
state
would
have
been
--
were
corrected
by
leading
questions
by
the
states
attorney.
and
i
would
submit
that
unlike
stovall
where
you
can
have
a
fair
lineup
without
an
attorney
present,
it
is
not
possible
to
have
a
fair
preliminary
hearing
or
preliminary
hearing
which
performs
the
function
of
a
preliminary
hearing
in
illinois
without
an
attorney.
mr.
edward
m.
genson
mr.
chief
justice,
at
the
preliminary
hearing
those
two
witnesses
would
be
cross-examined.
they
would
be
–
their
story
would
be
used
to
--
would
be
tested.
there
would
be
impeachment
perhaps
laid
for
further
use
at
trial.
at
the
preliminary
--
mr.
edward
m.
genson
no.
for
all
purposes
--mr.
chief
justice,
for
purposes
–
mr.
edward
m.
genson
well,
you
are
using
it
also
if
it
please
the
court
for
impeachment
because
those
statements
used
or
fastening
an
impeachment
tools
would
be
used
later
on.
mr.
edward
m.
genson
coleman
in
its
determination
of
the
values
of
a
preliminary
hearing
differs
between
the
fashioning
of
impeachment
tools
through
the
use
of
prior
--
through
the
use
of
the
prior
statements
at
trial
and
discovery.
mr.
edward
m.
genson
the
illinois
statute
relative
to
preliminary
hearings?
mr.
edward
m.
genson
no.
the
illinois
statute
relative
--
preliminary
hearings
deals
specifically
with
the
holding
of
the
preliminary
hearing
in
the
finding
of
probable
cause.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
in
illinois
which
deals
with
preliminary
hearing
which
relates
to
the
use
of
preliminary
hearings
for
purposes
of
either
discovery
or
impeachment.
mr.
edward
m.
genson
the
indictment
procedure
in
illinois
mr.
chief
justice,
but
at
that
time
they
no
longer
can.
but
at
that
time
at
the
time
of
the
preliminary
hearing
in
adams
the
prosecutor
would
have
had
the
option
of
going
directly
to
the
grand
jury
under
the
recent
constitution
which
came
into
effect
july
1,
1971.
if
an
arrest
is
made
and
no
indictment
is
pending
the
prosecutor
no
longer
has
that
option
in
illinois.
mr.
edward
m.
genson
he
must
go
to
preliminary
hearing
before
he
can
go
to
indictment.
mr.
edward
m.
genson
if
he
has
an
indictment
before
he
arrests,
he
can
bypass
the
preliminary
hearing.
but
i
would
just
like
to
point
out
that
the
vast
majority
of
the
arrest
in
cases
contemplate
or
result
from
arrest,
the
error
around
the
time
the
offense
is
allegedly
committed
and
indictments
are
very
rarely
sought.
only
in
the
exceptional
cases
you
would
have
an
indictment
prior
to
arrest
in
illinois.
mr.
edward
m.
genson
or
an
arrest
is
made
sometimes
a
month
or
two
later.
it
is
an
extremely
rare
situation
only
in
--
perhaps
certain
financial
claims
or
other
claims
of
that
type
in
illinois
have
we
seen
indictments
gained
before
the
arrest
sir.
in
illinois
also
with
reference
to
discovery
and
the
witnesses
can
be
--
the
lawyer
can
get
discovery
from
those
witnesses
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
now,
under
the
rules
as
they
were
fashioned
in
illinois
at
that
time,
the
only
items
that
the
attorney
were
entitled
to
were
the
witnesses
of
--
the
statements
of
the
defendant
and
a
list
of
witnesses.
at
the
time
of
the
trial
and
after
testimony,
the
statements
of
the
various
witnesses
were
available.
now,
if
these
witnesses
testified
at
trial,
of
course
again
in
addition
to
having
those
statements
available
for
impeachment
or
possible
impeachment
later
on,
these
statements
would
also
be
available
for
purposes
of
discovery
and
these
would
be
statements
under
the
discovery
rules
at
that
time
which
would
not
be
available
at
the
time
of
trial.
under
the
new
rules
these
statements
are
available
at
the
time
or
after
the
bringing
of
the
indictment
but
even
then
under
the
new
rules
of
the
indictment
in
illinois
generally
do
not
come
till
three
or
four
months
after
the
arrest.
the
attorney
in
illinois
in
addition
to
the
processes
of
getting
discovery
and
providing
impeachment
tool
can
expose
weaknesses
in
the
case
which
might
eliminate
an
indictment
and
this
is
very
relevant
certainly
under
the
new
rules
in
illinois
because
it
is
my
contention
that
the
illinois
rules
provide
that
once
there
has
been
a
finding
of
no
probable
cause
that
the
only
way
that
this
can
be
brought
again
before
the
court
system
is
for
new
evidence
to
be
found
and
if
brought
again
before
the
preliminary
hearing
judge.
the
value
of
an
attorney
in
illinois
is
--
goes
to
other
aspects
of
it.
the
great
majority
of
the
cases
brought
in
illinois
are
disposed
off
a
preliminary
hearing
to
reduction
of
charges,
though
acceptance
of
a
plea
to
a
lesser
charge.
through
an
acceptance
of
plea
on
an
information
which
is
filed
right
in
the
preliminary
hearing
courtroom
and
therefore
i
do
not
think
the
respondent
can
contest
the
fact
that
the
vast
majority
in
cases
--
of
cases
in
the
state
of
illinois
that
are
brought
as
felony
complaint
are
disposed
off
at
the
preliminary
hearing
level
and
this
is
another
value
at
least
in
the
state
if
illinois
for
the
retroactive
or
the
application
certainly
of
coleman
and
the
retroactive
application
in
this
case
because
a
lawyer
--
a
lawyer’s
presence
at
that
preliminary
hearing
becomes
immeasurable
at
that
time.
mr.
edward
m.
genson
the
procedure
generally
--
mr.
edward
m.
genson
the
preliminary
hearing
is
brought
by
a
felony
complaint.
the
plea
is
not
entered
at
that
time.
after
the
preliminary
hearing
the
procedure
usually
follows
that
the
prosecution
in
the
event
of
a
witness
perhaps
in
their
case
or
because
of
whatever
reasons
they
feel
is
important
would
reduce
that
charge
to
a
misdemeanor.
the
municipal
court
judge
at
that
time
has
jurisdiction
to
receive
a
plea
as
to
the
misdemeanor
equivalent
or
the
misdemeanor
included
offense
at
that
time.
they
also
have
in
illinois
an
information
process
wherein
at
--
just
subsequent
to
the
preliminary
hearing
the
judge
then
or
between
conferences
there
is
a
conference
that
takes
place
between
the
judge,
the
states
attorney
and
the
defense
attorney
pursuant
to
a
specific
supreme
court
rule
and
an
information
is
filed
pursuant
to
waiver
and
indictment
and
plea
negotiation
takes
place.
the
pleas
usually
received
at
the
preliminary
hearing
are
generally
quite
a
bit
less
in
the
event
that
you
do
partake
in
those
discussion
and
those
that
might
be
taken
after
indictment.
now
the
other
--
another
advantage
of
an
attorney
at
the
preliminary
here
in
illinois
is
regarding
psychiatric
examinations
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
there
has
been
no
cases
cited
and
the
respondents
make
the
point
that
there
is
no
authority
for
psychiatric
examination
in
the
state
of
illinois.
not
withstanding
that,
there
is
a
municipal
court
psychiatric
clinic
and
what
this
means
is,
it
is
either
a
great
number
of
cases
are
referred
when
there
is
evidence
of
some
sort
of
psychiatric
disorder
to
that
psychiatric
hearing
at
the
preliminary
hearing
level.
now,
the
value
of
an
attorney
in
asking
for
that
again
becomes
immeasurable
because
certainly,
if
your
honor
please,
the
psychiatric
examination
takes
place
with
one
--
maybe
a
week
or
two
weeks
after
the
alleged
commission
--
mr.
edward
m.
genson
the
preliminary
hearing
in
cook
county
is
held
in
municipal
court.
mr.
edward
m.
genson
as
far
as
i
can
determine
this
is
the
only
specific
psychiatric
service
available
in
cook
county.
mr.
edward
m.
genson
cook
county,
yes
sir.
your
honor
but
the
facts
of
the
matter
is
a
good
many
or
i
would
imagine
a
good
majority,
the
vast
majority
of
preliminary
hearings
held
in
the
state
of
illinois
are
held
in
cook
county.
and
therefore
i
think
it
is
important
to
point
out
to
you
your
honors
that
the
fact
that
the
--
psychiatric
examination
might
at
this
time
be
held
one
week,
one
week
or
two
weeks
perhaps
after
the
alleged
commission
of
the
offense
has
a
lot
more
value
than
having
one
order
subsequent
to
indictment
which
might
be
four
or
five
months
later.
another
added
addition
that
a
lawyer
can
perform
at
a
preliminary
hearing
--
mr.
edward
m.
genson
i
am
arguing
regarding
that
part
of
it.
regarding
the
psychiatric
examination
cook
county
law
but
there
is
nothing,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
which
prevents
an
attorney
from
requesting
a
psychiatric
examination
at
the
preliminary
hearing
level
under
illinois
law.
i
am
only
saying
that
the
facilities
are
available
in
cook
county,
of
a
specific
facility
designed
almost
entirely
for
this
purpose.
mr.
edward
m.
genson
he
would
have
to
make
a
request
to
the
preliminary
hearing
judge
and
the
preliminary
hearing
judge
would
either
not
or
he
would
either
order
or
not
order
it
but
there
is
no,
there
is
no
authority
in
illinois
allowing
or
not
allowing
him
to
order
it.
and
i
think
the
value
of
the
psychiatric
examination
is
certainly
immeasurable
when
one
considers
the
fact
that
indictments
generally
follow
the
crime
by
about
three
or
four
months.
i
know
the
prosecution
often
in
indictment
in
defenses
where
insanity
is
raised
would
raise
the
fact
that
the
examination
was
not
gotten
until
substantially
after
the
offense.
addition
--
mr.
edward
m.
genson
the
preliminary
hearing
practices
that
i
speak
to
are
before
but
after
the
same
rules
apply
with
the
additional
factor
that
under
new
illinois,
under
illinois
law
subsequent
to
the
constitution
the
preliminary
hearing
is
required
as
the
constitution
reads
unless
the
person
has
been
arrested,
unless
the
person
is
arrested
after
the
indictment.
mr.
edward
m.
genson
the
only
function
is,
is
that
it
eliminated
whatever
direct
indictments,
it
would
reference
to
cases,
specifically
murder
cases.
in
certain
narcotic
offenses,
direct
indictments
were
generally
the
only
way
it
was
proceeded.
they
would
arrest
them,
hold
the
preliminary
hearing,
the
state
would
continue
the
preliminary
hearing,
four
months
or
whatever.
and
during
that
time
they
would
proceed
to
indictment.
again
in
my
experience,
again
there
is
no
law
and
i
practice
all
through
the
state.
most
of
the
other
counties
did
not
practice
the
indirect
indictment
procedure.
almost
all
the
counties
even
before
practiced
a
system
wherein
preliminary
hearings
were
gained
before
indictment.
the
other
--
mr.
edward
m.
genson
it
can
be
proceeded
if
there
is
a
waiver.
generally
it
is
very
rare
that
you
see
an
information
unless
it
is
specifically
waived
and
it
is
generally
only
waived
in
cases
of
pleas
of
guilty.
and
the
information
proceeding
in
the
last
three
or
four
years
is
practiced
extensively
at
this
preliminary
hearing
level
because
of
a
constitutional
amendment
passed
about
three
years
ago
or
prior
to
that
constitutional
amendment
and
the
district
court
judge
did
not
have
the
power
to
take
a
plea
on
a
felony
even
by
information.
since
that
--
the
new
amendment,
they
have
been
allowed
to
do
this
and
therefore
they
have
in
proceeding
information
at
the
preliminary
hearing
level
in
great
amounts.
since
--
well,
in
the
last
two
or
three
years.
mr.
edward
m.
genson
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
edward
m.
genson
yes
sir.
the
only
additional
factor
that
i
would
like
to
point
out
is
that
even
under
the
new
constitution.
the
grand
jury
can
not
be
eliminated
by
a
simple
vote
of
a
legislature
and
this
again
assuming
that
this
might
be
done
which
certainly
put
greater
value
on
the
preliminary
hearing,
if
this
could
be
done
or
were
done.
another
function,
a
very
important
function
of
the
lawyer
or
the
attorney
in
illinois
at
a
preliminary
hearing
is
regarding
the
motion
to
suppress.
the
motion
to
suppress
at
the
preliminary
hearing
at
illinois
is
binding
and
appealable.
now
at
the
time
the
respondent
filed
their
brief
in
the
instant
court,
legislation
was
passed
by
the
state
to
bypass
this
and
to
allow
the
state
to
proceed
to
indictment
even
though
the
motion
to
suppress
has
been
sustained
by
the
preliminary
hearing
judge.
since
then,
that
law
has
been
declared
unconstitutional
and
the
state
of
the
law
in
illinois
at
this
time
and
at
the
time
of
the
instant
cause
of
the
adams
case
is
that
the
preliminary
hearing
in
court
makes
the
final
determination
on
motions
to
suppress.
the
preliminary
hearing
and
this
is
a
binding
and
appealable
order
and
if
not
appealed
by
the
state,
the
state
can
go
no
further
relative
to
that
evidence.
mr.
edward
m.
genson
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
m.
genson
because
mr.
justice,
i
feel
that
the
--
there
is
a
difference
in
determining
retroactivity.
the
only
test
is
not
whether
there
was
counsel
or
was
not.
there
are
three
tests.
but
going
back
to
the
first
test,
the
purpose
of
the
rule,
it
would
seem
that
an
attorney
at
a
preliminary
hearing
will
invariably
help
the
defendant
in
illinois
it
is
not
invariably
in
a
lineup
as
u.s.
versus
wade
that
it
would
not
held
--
mr.
edward
m.
genson
the
point
that
i
am
trying
to
make
mr.
justice
is
that
a
lineup
can
be
held,
a
lineup
can
be
fair
without
an
attorney
present,
it
is
possible.
a
preliminary
hearing
sir,
it
is
my
contention
cannot
be
fair.
mr.
edward
m.
genson
the
logic
--
mr.
edward
m.
genson
i
am
listening.
mr.
edward
m.
genson
in
--
mr.
edward
m.
genson
in
my
approach,
if
your
honor
please,
the
logic
of
brennan
--
he
logic
of
mr.
justice
brennan
in
coleman
would
not
allow
for
a
harmless
error
remand,
no
sir.
but
it
should
and
under
my
contention
i
would
think
it
should
be
a
person.
mr.
edward
m.
genson
i
think
that
one,
it
is
not
necessary
to
conclude
because
that
there
was
a
harmless
error
remand
that
the
case
should
not
be
retroactive.
i
think
the
determination
of
whether
or
not
a
case
should
be
retroactive
revolves
and
relies
on
all
three
criteria.
mr.
edward
m.
genson
i
am
not
saying
--
well,
no
i
do
not
think
so.
mr.
edward
m.
genson
the
illinois
court
where
there
was
not
dissent.
i
do
point
out
though
that
there
had
been
one
dissent
in
the
initial
finding
or
the
finding
of
people
versus
bonner.
that
was
by
justice
schauer.
mr.
edward
m.
genson
he
did
not
write
a
dissent,
there
was
no
dissent,
it
is
not
--
they
do
not
record
as
i
understand
it,
the
findings
in
illinois,
if
the
judge
does
not
write
a
dissent.
the
second
consideration
in
link
whether
it
is
a
reliance
of
the
law
enforcement
authorities
on
the
over
rule.
it
is
our
position
that
the
state
does
not
have
standing
argument.
reliance
in
non-retroactivity
applied
to
a
case
where
that
error
was
pointed
to
them
at
trial.
it
is
further
our
consideration
that
we
are
dealing
with
different
types
of
law
enforcement
authority.
is
it
by
law
enforcement
authorities
we
mean
the
police
officers
and
police
investigative
technique
certainly
there
was
no
reliance
there
and
i
think
there
is
a
far
greater
argument
for
retroactivity
where
police
investigative
techniques
as
opposed
to
court
procedures
are
involved.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out,
they
are
the
differentiation
in
stovall,
because
in
stovall
we
were
dealing
with
various
investigative
techniques
that
it
was
arguably
made
that
the
police
were
depending
on
it,
at
the
time
of
the
waived
decision.
in
this
particular
case
though
this
does
not
reflect
that,
it
reflects
only
of
the
effect
on
the
courts
and
i
think
that
is
properly
dealt
with
the
last
point,
the
administration
of
justice.
lastly,
relative
to
the
reliance
point,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
coleman
opinion
as
pointed
out
by
many
of
the
opinion
in
the
decision
was
certainly
foreshadowed
by
the
decisions
that
proceeded
it
and
perhaps
not
relied
on
by
some
of
the
state
courts,
it
should
have
been
because
of
the
different
opinions
by
the
court
relative
to
the
right
of
counsel.
the
third
criteria
that
i
would
like
to
point
--
that
the
link
rather
points
out
is
the
effect
of
the
new
rule
on
the
retroactivity
of
the
new
rule
on
the
administration
of
justice.
the
effect
of
this
case,
we
feel
is
negligible
because
we
are
asking
that
rule
to
be
applied
and
limited
to
only
those
cases
where
it
is
raised
the
trial.
that
is
if
a
man
has
counsel
at
trial
and
if
the
counsel
does
not
raise
or
make
issue
of
the
fact
that
he
did
not
have
an
attorney
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
we
are
asking
that
the
court
deemed
this
to
be
waived
and
not
apply
it
retroactively
as
to
those
cases
where
it
has
been
raised
as
it
has
been
raised
in
this
case,
we
would
ask
that
it
be
quite
applied
retroactively.
i
think
the
effect
on
the
administration
of
justice
as
to
that
type
of
application
certainly
would
be
negligible.
thank
you.
mr.
edward
m.
genson
just
briefly
speaking
and
may
it
please
the
court.
justice
schauer
in
his
dissent
in
bonner
did
deal
with
constitutional
issues
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
stated
that
if
constitutional
issues
are
to
be
considered,
this
is
the
last
two
paragraphs
of
his
opinion,
the
appropriate
constitutional
reference
in
my
opinion
is
escobedo
versus
illinois
in
which
it
was
held
that
a
constitutional
right
of
counsel
was
abrogated
when
a
suspect
was
denied
an
opportunity
to
consult
with
his
retained
attorney.
following
that
he
points
out
to
the
--
he
points
out
the
different
advantages
a
defendant
would
have
where
he
would
have
had
an
attorney
at
the
trial.
so,
justice
schauer
did
in
his
concurring
opinion
or
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
bonner
did
speak
to
the
constitutional
issue.
further,
i
would
like
to
point
this
out
that
relative
to
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment
that
was
filed,
the
motion
to
dismiss
indictment
within
illinois
had
the
same
effect
as
the
motion
to
request
a
preliminary
hearing.
the
indictment
would
have
been
dismissed,
the
statute
of
limitations
would
have
been
tolled,
there
would
have
been
no
difference.
thirdly,
i
would
like
to
say
this,
whether
in
fact
a
harmless
error
could
be
shown
would
depend
i
think
on
the
individual
case,
and
therefore,
it
would
become
relevant
whether
a
case
was
a
strong
or
weak
one.
in
this
case
the
testimony
revolved
around
the
uncorroborated
statement
or
substantially
uncorroborated
statement
of
an
addict
informer
who
allegedly
purchased
narcotic
during
a
substantial
period
of
time,
though
the
policemen
were
not
present
and
a
lot
of
things
could
have
happened.
in
illinois
--
mr.
edward
m.
genson
in
illinois
and
on
the
basis
of
the
different
appellate
opinions,
a
sale
of
narcotics
to
an
addict
informer
which
is
substantially
uncorroborated
would
merit
reversal.
the
courts
in
the
--
the
court
has
in
cases
dealing
with
the
right
to
counsel
as
a
judicial
proceeding
have
held
this
to
be
retroactive
in
the
past.
we
are
contending
and
asking
in
the
present
case
that
this
be
done
here
too.
one
more
thing
i
would
like
to
point
out.
the
due
process
exception
in
bonner
or
alleged
due
process,
there
is
nothing
in
bonner
which
specifically
states
that
a
man
has
a
remedy
if
he
could
show
prejudice
and
i
think
one
of
the
difference
and
perhaps
if
this
court
and
their
opinion
would
point
out
the
difference,
one
of
the
differences
between
coleman
or
stovall
and
johnson
and
coleman
is
in
stovall,
we
specifically
state
that
there
is
a
due
process
or
a
stopgap
in
the
event
because
it
is
not
being
held
retroactive.
in
johnson,
they
specifically
say
that
the
due
process
is
stopgap
relative
to
the
issue
of
voluntariness.
the
bonner
case
in
illinois
does
not
set
out
any
test
whatsoever
as
to
whether
or
not
something
should
devolve
or
be
a
violation
of
due
process.
the
only
remarks
in
either
bonner
or
morris
is
that
in
this
case
no
prejudice
was
shown.
it
does
not
state
specifically
that
if
prejudice
would
be
shown
that
we
would
--
that
there
would
be
any
opportunity
for
the
defendant
to
waive
this
in
any
way.
so
i
think
this
is
another
important
difference
between
stovall,
between
johnson
and
between
coleman
in
that
in
stovall
and
johnson
there
is
an
expressed
exception,
a
due
process
exception.
there
would
be
none
under
illinois
law
specifically.
there
is
nothing
in
illinois
that
leads
to
it.
the
last
point
i
would
make
is
the
analogy
between
or
the
analogies
made
between
bloom,
duncan,
griffin,
relative
to
the
effect
on
the
fact
finding
process.
coleman
dealt
with
a
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
just
as
gideon
dealt
with
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel.
bloom
and
duncan
in
order
to
assume
a
lack
of
fairness
would
have
had
to
assume
that
the
judge
that
heard
the
case
was
prejudiced.
griffin
concluded
that
this
was
a
fifth
amendment
protection.
in
this
case,
coleman
is
a
sixth
amendment
protection
and
the
sixth
amendment
protection
at
a
judicial
proceeding
and
this
is
in
a
--
we
feel
that
the
exception
is
broad
enough
here
to
the
other
cases.
the
differences
are
clear
enough
as
to
one
claim
of
retroactivity.
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
m.
genson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
grant
of
certiorari
in
the
instant
case
is
limited
to
the
single
question
whether
coleman
versus
alabama
is
retroactive
and
applicable
to
the
instant
case
were
prior
to
trial.
the
defendant
objected
to
the
failure
to
provide
counsel
at
a
preliminary
hearing.
it
is
our
position
that
the
state
does
not
have
standing
or
right,
to
argue
reliance
or
non-retroactivity.
in
a
case
where
the
error
was
pointed
out
to
the
state
by
the
defendant
prior
to
the
trial
to
the
court
and
the
state
ignored
the
plea
proceeding
to
trial.
the
case
of
linkletter
versus
walker
established
the
criteria
for
determining
whether
a
rule
should
be
or
should
not
be
retroactive.
the
reasons
and
the
criteria
were
the
purposes
to
be
served
by
the
new
rule,
the
reliance
on
the
old
rule
and
the
effect
of
the
new
rule
--
the
retroactivity,
retroactive
application
of
the
new
rule
on
the
administration
of
justice.
the
purpose
of
the
rule
in
coleman
as
i
see
it
is
to
enhance
the
integrity
of
the
fact
finding
process
and
thy
doing
this
by
providing
a
lawyer
at
the
preliminary
hearing
which
in
illinois
is
a
very
critical
stage
of
the
proceeding
and
a
very
vital
stage
of
the
proceeding
in
the
prosecution
of
a
defendant.
the
value
of
counsel
at
a
preliminary
hearing
in
illinois
is
immeasurable.
the
attorney
as
pointed
out
in
coleman
can
use
the
impeachment
tool
later
at
trial.
he
can
fashion
his
tool
and
this
would
be
something
--
would
be
impossible
to
do
without
an
attorney
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
as
justice
schauer
pointed
out
in
his
dissent
in
bonner,
bonner
is
one
of
the
cases
in
illinois
that
established
the
preliminary
hearing
not
to
be
a
critical
stage.
in
that
case
where
there
was
no
counsel
the
witness
testified
against
the
defendant
in
response
to
leading
questions
by
the
prosecutor
in
the
court.
he
was
not
advising
my
co-witnesses
on
his
own
behalf,
he
did
not
testify.
he
was
not
advised
that
witnesses
could
be
excluded
or
kept
separate
during
examination.
he
was
not
advised
at
the
preliminary
hearing
and
illinois
can
be
used
to
perpetuate
testimony
which
is
specific
in
the
statute.
i
differ
with
the
respondent’s
analogy
of
stovall
versus
denno
and
coleman
as
i
can
contemplate
a
fair
wind
up
without
an
attorney
present
but
how
might
a
preliminary
hearing
be
there
without
an
attorney.
this
is
an
adversary
proceeding.
in
this
particular
case,
in
the
instant
case
not
one
question
was
asked
by
the
defendant,
not
one
witness
was
called
by
the
defendant.
the
insufficiencies
or
whatever
insufficiencies
that
there
might
have
been
indicate
for
the
state
would
have
been
--
were
corrected
by
leading
questions
by
the
states
attorney.
and
i
would
submit
that
unlike
stovall
where
you
can
have
a
fair
lineup
without
an
attorney
present,
it
is
not
possible
to
have
a
fair
preliminary
hearing
or
preliminary
hearing
which
performs
the
function
of
a
preliminary
hearing
in
illinois
without
an
attorney.
mr.
edward
m.
genson
mr.
chief
justice,
at
the
preliminary
hearing
those
two
witnesses
would
be
cross-examined.
they
would
be
–
their
story
would
be
used
to
--
would
be
tested.
there
would
be
impeachment
perhaps
laid
for
further
use
at
trial.
at
the
preliminary
--
mr.
edward
m.
genson
no.
for
all
purposes
--mr.
chief
justice,
for
purposes
–
mr.
edward
m.
genson
well,
you
are
using
it
also
if
it
please
the
court
for
impeachment
because
those
statements
used
or
fastening
an
impeachment
tools
would
be
used
later
on.
mr.
edward
m.
genson
coleman
in
its
determination
of
the
values
of
a
preliminary
hearing
differs
between
the
fashioning
of
impeachment
tools
through
the
use
of
prior
--
through
the
use
of
the
prior
statements
at
trial
and
discovery.
mr.
edward
m.
genson
the
illinois
statute
relative
to
preliminary
hearings?
mr.
edward
m.
genson
no.
the
illinois
statute
relative
--
preliminary
hearings
deals
specifically
with
the
holding
of
the
preliminary
hearing
in
the
finding
of
probable
cause.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
in
illinois
which
deals
with
preliminary
hearing
which
relates
to
the
use
of
preliminary
hearings
for
purposes
of
either
discovery
or
impeachment.
mr.
edward
m.
genson
the
indictment
procedure
in
illinois
mr.
chief
justice,
but
at
that
time
they
no
longer
can.
but
at
that
time
at
the
time
of
the
preliminary
hearing
in
adams
the
prosecutor
would
have
had
the
option
of
going
directly
to
the
grand
jury
under
the
recent
constitution
which
came
into
effect
july
1,
1971.
if
an
arrest
is
made
and
no
indictment
is
pending
the
prosecutor
no
longer
has
that
option
in
illinois.
mr.
edward
m.
genson
he
must
go
to
preliminary
hearing
before
he
can
go
to
indictment.
mr.
edward
m.
genson
if
he
has
an
indictment
before
he
arrests,
he
can
bypass
the
preliminary
hearing.
but
i
would
just
like
to
point
out
that
the
vast
majority
of
the
arrest
in
cases
contemplate
or
result
from
arrest,
the
error
around
the
time
the
offense
is
allegedly
committed
and
indictments
are
very
rarely
sought.
only
in
the
exceptional
cases
you
would
have
an
indictment
prior
to
arrest
in
illinois.
mr.
edward
m.
genson
or
an
arrest
is
made
sometimes
a
month
or
two
later.
it
is
an
extremely
rare
situation
only
in
--
perhaps
certain
financial
claims
or
other
claims
of
that
type
in
illinois
have
we
seen
indictments
gained
before
the
arrest
sir.
in
illinois
also
with
reference
to
discovery
and
the
witnesses
can
be
--
the
lawyer
can
get
discovery
from
those
witnesses
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
now,
under
the
rules
as
they
were
fashioned
in
illinois
at
that
time,
the
only
items
that
the
attorney
were
entitled
to
were
the
witnesses
of
--
the
statements
of
the
defendant
and
a
list
of
witnesses.
at
the
time
of
the
trial
and
after
testimony,
the
statements
of
the
various
witnesses
were
available.
now,
if
these
witnesses
testified
at
trial,
of
course
again
in
addition
to
having
those
statements
available
for
impeachment
or
possible
impeachment
later
on,
these
statements
would
also
be
available
for
purposes
of
discovery
and
these
would
be
statements
under
the
discovery
rules
at
that
time
which
would
not
be
available
at
the
time
of
trial.
under
the
new
rules
these
statements
are
available
at
the
time
or
after
the
bringing
of
the
indictment
but
even
then
under
the
new
rules
of
the
indictment
in
illinois
generally
do
not
come
till
three
or
four
months
after
the
arrest.
the
attorney
in
illinois
in
addition
to
the
processes
of
getting
discovery
and
providing
impeachment
tool
can
expose
weaknesses
in
the
case
which
might
eliminate
an
indictment
and
this
is
very
relevant
certainly
under
the
new
rules
in
illinois
because
it
is
my
contention
that
the
illinois
rules
provide
that
once
there
has
been
a
finding
of
no
probable
cause
that
the
only
way
that
this
can
be
brought
again
before
the
court
system
is
for
new
evidence
to
be
found
and
if
brought
again
before
the
preliminary
hearing
judge.
the
value
of
an
attorney
in
illinois
is
--
goes
to
other
aspects
of
it.
the
great
majority
of
the
cases
brought
in
illinois
are
disposed
off
a
preliminary
hearing
to
reduction
of
charges,
though
acceptance
of
a
plea
to
a
lesser
charge.
through
an
acceptance
of
plea
on
an
information
which
is
filed
right
in
the
preliminary
hearing
courtroom
and
therefore
i
do
not
think
the
respondent
can
contest
the
fact
that
the
vast
majority
in
cases
--
of
cases
in
the
state
of
illinois
that
are
brought
as
felony
complaint
are
disposed
off
at
the
preliminary
hearing
level
and
this
is
another
value
at
least
in
the
state
if
illinois
for
the
retroactive
or
the
application
certainly
of
coleman
and
the
retroactive
application
in
this
case
because
a
lawyer
--
a
lawyer’s
presence
at
that
preliminary
hearing
becomes
immeasurable
at
that
time.
mr.
edward
m.
genson
the
procedure
generally
--
mr.
edward
m.
genson
the
preliminary
hearing
is
brought
by
a
felony
complaint.
the
plea
is
not
entered
at
that
time.
after
the
preliminary
hearing
the
procedure
usually
follows
that
the
prosecution
in
the
event
of
a
witness
perhaps
in
their
case
or
because
of
whatever
reasons
they
feel
is
important
would
reduce
that
charge
to
a
misdemeanor.
the
municipal
court
judge
at
that
time
has
jurisdiction
to
receive
a
plea
as
to
the
misdemeanor
equivalent
or
the
misdemeanor
included
offense
at
that
time.
they
also
have
in
illinois
an
information
process
wherein
at
--
just
subsequent
to
the
preliminary
hearing
the
judge
then
or
between
conferences
there
is
a
conference
that
takes
place
between
the
judge,
the
states
attorney
and
the
defense
attorney
pursuant
to
a
specific
supreme
court
rule
and
an
information
is
filed
pursuant
to
waiver
and
indictment
and
plea
negotiation
takes
place.
the
pleas
usually
received
at
the
preliminary
hearing
are
generally
quite
a
bit
less
in
the
event
that
you
do
partake
in
those
discussion
and
those
that
might
be
taken
after
indictment.
now
the
other
--
another
advantage
of
an
attorney
at
the
preliminary
here
in
illinois
is
regarding
psychiatric
examinations
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
there
has
been
no
cases
cited
and
the
respondents
make
the
point
that
there
is
no
authority
for
psychiatric
examination
in
the
state
of
illinois.
not
withstanding
that,
there
is
a
municipal
court
psychiatric
clinic
and
what
this
means
is,
it
is
either
a
great
number
of
cases
are
referred
when
there
is
evidence
of
some
sort
of
psychiatric
disorder
to
that
psychiatric
hearing
at
the
preliminary
hearing
level.
now,
the
value
of
an
attorney
in
asking
for
that
again
becomes
immeasurable
because
certainly,
if
your
honor
please,
the
psychiatric
examination
takes
place
with
one
--
maybe
a
week
or
two
weeks
after
the
alleged
commission
--
mr.
edward
m.
genson
the
preliminary
hearing
in
cook
county
is
held
in
municipal
court.
mr.
edward
m.
genson
as
far
as
i
can
determine
this
is
the
only
specific
psychiatric
service
available
in
cook
county.
mr.
edward
m.
genson
cook
county,
yes
sir.
your
honor
but
the
facts
of
the
matter
is
a
good
many
or
i
would
imagine
a
good
majority,
the
vast
majority
of
preliminary
hearings
held
in
the
state
of
illinois
are
held
in
cook
county.
and
therefore
i
think
it
is
important
to
point
out
to
you
your
honors
that
the
fact
that
the
--
psychiatric
examination
might
at
this
time
be
held
one
week,
one
week
or
two
weeks
perhaps
after
the
alleged
commission
of
the
offense
has
a
lot
more
value
than
having
one
order
subsequent
to
indictment
which
might
be
four
or
five
months
later.
another
added
addition
that
a
lawyer
can
perform
at
a
preliminary
hearing
--
mr.
edward
m.
genson
i
am
arguing
regarding
that
part
of
it.
regarding
the
psychiatric
examination
cook
county
law
but
there
is
nothing,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
which
prevents
an
attorney
from
requesting
a
psychiatric
examination
at
the
preliminary
hearing
level
under
illinois
law.
i
am
only
saying
that
the
facilities
are
available
in
cook
county,
of
a
specific
facility
designed
almost
entirely
for
this
purpose.
mr.
edward
m.
genson
he
would
have
to
make
a
request
to
the
preliminary
hearing
judge
and
the
preliminary
hearing
judge
would
either
not
or
he
would
either
order
or
not
order
it
but
there
is
no,
there
is
no
authority
in
illinois
allowing
or
not
allowing
him
to
order
it.
and
i
think
the
value
of
the
psychiatric
examination
is
certainly
immeasurable
when
one
considers
the
fact
that
indictments
generally
follow
the
crime
by
about
three
or
four
months.
i
know
the
prosecution
often
in
indictment
in
defenses
where
insanity
is
raised
would
raise
the
fact
that
the
examination
was
not
gotten
until
substantially
after
the
offense.
addition
--
mr.
edward
m.
genson
the
preliminary
hearing
practices
that
i
speak
to
are
before
but
after
the
same
rules
apply
with
the
additional
factor
that
under
new
illinois,
under
illinois
law
subsequent
to
the
constitution
the
preliminary
hearing
is
required
as
the
constitution
reads
unless
the
person
has
been
arrested,
unless
the
person
is
arrested
after
the
indictment.
mr.
edward
m.
genson
the
only
function
is,
is
that
it
eliminated
whatever
direct
indictments,
it
would
reference
to
cases,
specifically
murder
cases.
in
certain
narcotic
offenses,
direct
indictments
were
generally
the
only
way
it
was
proceeded.
they
would
arrest
them,
hold
the
preliminary
hearing,
the
state
would
continue
the
preliminary
hearing,
four
months
or
whatever.
and
during
that
time
they
would
proceed
to
indictment.
again
in
my
experience,
again
there
is
no
law
and
i
practice
all
through
the
state.
most
of
the
other
counties
did
not
practice
the
indirect
indictment
procedure.
almost
all
the
counties
even
before
practiced
a
system
wherein
preliminary
hearings
were
gained
before
indictment.
the
other
--
mr.
edward
m.
genson
it
can
be
proceeded
if
there
is
a
waiver.
generally
it
is
very
rare
that
you
see
an
information
unless
it
is
specifically
waived
and
it
is
generally
only
waived
in
cases
of
pleas
of
guilty.
and
the
information
proceeding
in
the
last
three
or
four
years
is
practiced
extensively
at
this
preliminary
hearing
level
because
of
a
constitutional
amendment
passed
about
three
years
ago
or
prior
to
that
constitutional
amendment
and
the
district
court
judge
did
not
have
the
power
to
take
a
plea
on
a
felony
even
by
information.
since
that
--
the
new
amendment,
they
have
been
allowed
to
do
this
and
therefore
they
have
in
proceeding
information
at
the
preliminary
hearing
level
in
great
amounts.
since
--
well,
in
the
last
two
or
three
years.
mr.
edward
m.
genson
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
edward
m.
genson
yes
sir.
the
only
additional
factor
that
i
would
like
to
point
out
is
that
even
under
the
new
constitution.
the
grand
jury
can
not
be
eliminated
by
a
simple
vote
of
a
legislature
and
this
again
assuming
that
this
might
be
done
which
certainly
put
greater
value
on
the
preliminary
hearing,
if
this
could
be
done
or
were
done.
another
function,
a
very
important
function
of
the
lawyer
or
the
attorney
in
illinois
at
a
preliminary
hearing
is
regarding
the
motion
to
suppress.
the
motion
to
suppress
at
the
preliminary
hearing
at
illinois
is
binding
and
appealable.
now
at
the
time
the
respondent
filed
their
brief
in
the
instant
court,
legislation
was
passed
by
the
state
to
bypass
this
and
to
allow
the
state
to
proceed
to
indictment
even
though
the
motion
to
suppress
has
been
sustained
by
the
preliminary
hearing
judge.
since
then,
that
law
has
been
declared
unconstitutional
and
the
state
of
the
law
in
illinois
at
this
time
and
at
the
time
of
the
instant
cause
of
the
adams
case
is
that
the
preliminary
hearing
in
court
makes
the
final
determination
on
motions
to
suppress.
the
preliminary
hearing
and
this
is
a
binding
and
appealable
order
and
if
not
appealed
by
the
state,
the
state
can
go
no
further
relative
to
that
evidence.
mr.
edward
m.
genson
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
m.
genson
because
mr.
justice,
i
feel
that
the
--
there
is
a
difference
in
determining
retroactivity.
the
only
test
is
not
whether
there
was
counsel
or
was
not.
there
are
three
tests.
but
going
back
to
the
first
test,
the
purpose
of
the
rule,
it
would
seem
that
an
attorney
at
a
preliminary
hearing
will
invariably
help
the
defendant
in
illinois
it
is
not
invariably
in
a
lineup
as
u.s.
versus
wade
that
it
would
not
held
--
mr.
edward
m.
genson
the
point
that
i
am
trying
to
make
mr.
justice
is
that
a
lineup
can
be
held,
a
lineup
can
be
fair
without
an
attorney
present,
it
is
possible.
a
preliminary
hearing
sir,
it
is
my
contention
cannot
be
fair.
mr.
edward
m.
genson
the
logic
--
mr.
edward
m.
genson
i
am
listening.
mr.
edward
m.
genson
in
--
mr.
edward
m.
genson
in
my
approach,
if
your
honor
please,
the
logic
of
brennan
--
he
logic
of
mr.
justice
brennan
in
coleman
would
not
allow
for
a
harmless
error
remand,
no
sir.
but
it
should
and
under
my
contention
i
would
think
it
should
be
a
person.
mr.
edward
m.
genson
i
think
that
one,
it
is
not
necessary
to
conclude
because
that
there
was
a
harmless
error
remand
that
the
case
should
not
be
retroactive.
i
think
the
determination
of
whether
or
not
a
case
should
be
retroactive
revolves
and
relies
on
all
three
criteria.
mr.
edward
m.
genson
i
am
not
saying
--
well,
no
i
do
not
think
so.
mr.
edward
m.
genson
the
illinois
court
where
there
was
not
dissent.
i
do
point
out
though
that
there
had
been
one
dissent
in
the
initial
finding
or
the
finding
of
people
versus
bonner.
that
was
by
justice
schauer.
mr.
edward
m.
genson
he
did
not
write
a
dissent,
there
was
no
dissent,
it
is
not
--
they
do
not
record
as
i
understand
it,
the
findings
in
illinois,
if
the
judge
does
not
write
a
dissent.
the
second
consideration
in
link
whether
it
is
a
reliance
of
the
law
enforcement
authorities
on
the
over
rule.
it
is
our
position
that
the
state
does
not
have
standing
argument.
reliance
in
non-retroactivity
applied
to
a
case
where
that
error
was
pointed
to
them
at
trial.
it
is
further
our
consideration
that
we
are
dealing
with
different
types
of
law
enforcement
authority.
is
it
by
law
enforcement
authorities
we
mean
the
police
officers
and
police
investigative
technique
certainly
there
was
no
reliance
there
and
i
think
there
is
a
far
greater
argument
for
retroactivity
where
police
investigative
techniques
as
opposed
to
court
procedures
are
involved.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out,
they
are
the
differentiation
in
stovall,
because
in
stovall
we
were
dealing
with
various
investigative
techniques
that
it
was
arguably
made
that
the
police
were
depending
on
it,
at
the
time
of
the
waived
decision.
in
this
particular
case
though
this
does
not
reflect
that,
it
reflects
only
of
the
effect
on
the
courts
and
i
think
that
is
properly
dealt
with
the
last
point,
the
administration
of
justice.
lastly,
relative
to
the
reliance
point,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
coleman
opinion
as
pointed
out
by
many
of
the
opinion
in
the
decision
was
certainly
foreshadowed
by
the
decisions
that
proceeded
it
and
perhaps
not
relied
on
by
some
of
the
state
courts,
it
should
have
been
because
of
the
different
opinions
by
the
court
relative
to
the
right
of
counsel.
the
third
criteria
that
i
would
like
to
point
--
that
the
link
rather
points
out
is
the
effect
of
the
new
rule
on
the
retroactivity
of
the
new
rule
on
the
administration
of
justice.
the
effect
of
this
case,
we
feel
is
negligible
because
we
are
asking
that
rule
to
be
applied
and
limited
to
only
those
cases
where
it
is
raised
the
trial.
that
is
if
a
man
has
counsel
at
trial
and
if
the
counsel
does
not
raise
or
make
issue
of
the
fact
that
he
did
not
have
an
attorney
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
we
are
asking
that
the
court
deemed
this
to
be
waived
and
not
apply
it
retroactively
as
to
those
cases
where
it
has
been
raised
as
it
has
been
raised
in
this
case,
we
would
ask
that
it
be
quite
applied
retroactively.
i
think
the
effect
on
the
administration
of
justice
as
to
that
type
of
application
certainly
would
be
negligible.
thank
you.
mr.
edward
m.
genson
just
briefly
speaking
and
may
it
please
the
court.
justice
schauer
in
his
dissent
in
bonner
did
deal
with
constitutional
issues
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
stated
that
if
constitutional
issues
are
to
be
considered,
this
is
the
last
two
paragraphs
of
his
opinion,
the
appropriate
constitutional
reference
in
my
opinion
is
escobedo
versus
illinois
in
which
it
was
held
that
a
constitutional
right
of
counsel
was
abrogated
when
a
suspect
was
denied
an
opportunity
to
consult
with
his
retained
attorney.
following
that
he
points
out
to
the
--
he
points
out
the
different
advantages
a
defendant
would
have
where
he
would
have
had
an
attorney
at
the
trial.
so,
justice
schauer
did
in
his
concurring
opinion
or
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
bonner
did
speak
to
the
constitutional
issue.
further,
i
would
like
to
point
this
out
that
relative
to
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment
that
was
filed,
the
motion
to
dismiss
indictment
within
illinois
had
the
same
effect
as
the
motion
to
request
a
preliminary
hearing.
the
indictment
would
have
been
dismissed,
the
statute
of
limitations
would
have
been
tolled,
there
would
have
been
no
difference.
thirdly,
i
would
like
to
say
this,
whether
in
fact
a
harmless
error
could
be
shown
would
depend
i
think
on
the
individual
case,
and
therefore,
it
would
become
relevant
whether
a
case
was
a
strong
or
weak
one.
in
this
case
the
testimony
revolved
around
the
uncorroborated
statement
or
substantially
uncorroborated
statement
of
an
addict
informer
who
allegedly
purchased
narcotic
during
a
substantial
period
of
time,
though
the
policemen
were
not
present
and
a
lot
of
things
could
have
happened.
in
illinois
--
mr.
edward
m.
genson
in
illinois
and
on
the
basis
of
the
different
appellate
opinions,
a
sale
of
narcotics
to
an
addict
informer
which
is
substantially
uncorroborated
would
merit
reversal.
the
courts
in
the
--
the
court
has
in
cases
dealing
with
the
right
to
counsel
as
a
judicial
proceeding
have
held
this
to
be
retroactive
in
the
past.
we
are
contending
and
asking
in
the
present
case
that
this
be
done
here
too.
one
more
thing
i
would
like
to
point
out.
the
due
process
exception
in
bonner
or
alleged
due
process,
there
is
nothing
in
bonner
which
specifically
states
that
a
man
has
a
remedy
if
he
could
show
prejudice
and
i
think
one
of
the
difference
and
perhaps
if
this
court
and
their
opinion
would
point
out
the
difference,
one
of
the
differences
between
coleman
or
stovall
and
johnson
and
coleman
is
in
stovall,
we
specifically
state
that
there
is
a
due
process
or
a
stopgap
in
the
event
because
it
is
not
being
held
retroactive.
in
johnson,
they
specifically
say
that
the
due
process
is
stopgap
relative
to
the
issue
of
voluntariness.
the
bonner
case
in
illinois
does
not
set
out
any
test
whatsoever
as
to
whether
or
not
something
should
devolve
or
be
a
violation
of
due
process.
the
only
remarks
in
either
bonner
or
morris
is
that
in
this
case
no
prejudice
was
shown.
it
does
not
state
specifically
that
if
prejudice
would
be
shown
that
we
would
--
that
there
would
be
any
opportunity
for
the
defendant
to
waive
this
in
any
way.
so
i
think
this
is
another
important
difference
between
stovall,
between
johnson
and
between
coleman
in
that
in
stovall
and
johnson
there
is
an
expressed
exception,
a
due
process
exception.
there
would
be
none
under
illinois
law
specifically.
there
is
nothing
in
illinois
that
leads
to
it.
the
last
point
i
would
make
is
the
analogy
between
or
the
analogies
made
between
bloom,
duncan,
griffin,
