mr.
james
e.
gildea
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
must
i
forget
to
mention
this
i
would
like
to
first
deviate
from
my
prepared
text
in
connection
with
the
questions
concerning
the
bonner
case
and
justice
schauer's
dissent.
i
would
urge
your
honors
to
consider
the
fact
that
justice
schauer
dissent
at
that
case
did
not
address
itself
to
the
constitutional
question.
it
addressed
itself
to
a
matter
of
statutory
interpretation
as
construed
by
the
majority
of
the
court’s
statutory
interpretation
under
the
illinois
law.
we
had
a
statute
that
provided
that
counsel
was
to
be
appointed
at
the
preliminary
hearing
if
a
defendant
was
indigent.
we
had
another
statute
saying
that
at
the
point
of
arraignment
no
plea
was
to
be
taken
without
appointment
of
counsel.
the
bonner
case
construed
the
two
statutes
to
be
imparting
a
curia
and
held
that
the
two
provisions
required
only
that
counsel
be
appointed
prior
to
any
plea
wherever
interposed
and
justice
schauer
took
umbrage
with
that
and
took
exception
and
it
was
his
opinion
that
the
illinois
statute
provided
otherwise.
however,
he
did
not
dissent
on
the
basis
of
any
constitutional
questions.
as
to
the
factual
background
of
this
case
is
your
honor,
this
case
charged
the
defendant
with
the
sale
of
narcotics
and
it
was
a
what
we
call
a
controlled
sale
and
that
an
informant
was
used
in
connection
with
two
police
officers.
the
defendant
was
arrested
immediately
after
the
alleged
incident
and
he
appeared
in
court
the
following
day.
the
case
was
then
held
on
call
for
one
day
and
continued
variously.
subsequently
there
was
a
preliminary
hearing
and
we
conceive
that
the
counsel
was
not
appointed
by
the
judge
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
there
was
testimony
introduced
at
that
point
from
one
witness,
one
of
the
officers
upon
the
testimony
of
that
officer
the
judge
found
probable
cause
and
held
the
defendant
to
answer
to
the
grand
jury,
indictment
was
returned
and
it
was
not
until
the
day
that
the
case
was
set
for
trial
that
counsel
for
the
defendant
filed
his
motion
in
connection
with
a
claim
for
having
his
constitutional
rights
violative
by
a
failure
to
appoint
counsel
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
and
in
that
connection,
the
motion
that
was
filed
was
a
motion
to
quash
the
indictment.
it
was
not
a
motion
asking
for
a
preliminary
hearing
and
the
defendant
did
not
in
his
motion
alleged
that
he
was
in
fact
indigent
and
therefore
required
the
appointment
of
counsel.
and
furthermore
the
defendant
did
not
allege
that
he
suffered
any
prejudice
during
the
course
of
their
preliminary
hearing.
now,
addressing
myself
to
the
principal
issues
here,
since
linkletter
versus
walker
on
--
down
through
the
recent
cases
that
the
court
pronounced
last
year
in
speaking
in
terms
of
williams
and
hill
and
elkanich.
the
court
has
applied
a
three
fold
test
in
determining
whether
or
not
a
new
constitutional
doctrine
should
be
held
retroactive.
in
that
connection
the
court
has
stated
that
deciding
that
issue
the
court
will
look
first
of
all
to
the
purpose
of
the
new
constitutional
doctrine,
secondly,
to
prior
reliance
on
previous
standards
and
thirdly,
to
the
effect
on
the
administration
of
justice.
addressing
myself,
first
of
all
to
the
purpose
of
the
constitutional
doctrine
as
pronounced
in
coleman
versus
alabama,
the
court
stated
that
the
purpose
was
to
secure
for
a
defendant
advantages
prefatory
to
trial
and
in
that
connection
the
court
mentioned
six
possible
advantages.
the
court
said
that
the
presence
of
counsel
at
a
preliminary
hearing
might
be
effective
in
preventing
a
possible
bind
over
to
the
grand
jury
by
making
effective
arguments
and
cross-examination
or
whatnot.
secondly,
he
could
perhaps
to
secure
a
lower
bail
or
bail
initially
and
he
would
have
some
bearing
or
he
would
have
some
influence
on
that
determination.
thirdly,
by
cross-examination,
he
could
perhaps
create
material
for
impeachment
at
trial.
he
could
discover
the
--
some
of
the
state’s
evidence
that
would
be
used
to
trial.
he
could
perpetuate
favorable
testimony
for
a
later
date
and
then
he
could
secure
an
early
psychiatric
examination.
now,
with
connection
to
the
purpose
--
aspect
of
the
purpose
criterion,
the
court
said
that
where
the
major
purpose
of
a
new
constitutional
doctrine
is
to
overcome
an
aspect
of
the
trial
would
substantially
impair
the
truth
finding
process
so
as
to
create
serious
doubt
as
to
the
reliability
of
a
guilty
verdict.
in
prior
cases
this
court
will
hold
the
doctrine
retroactive.
in
that
connection
we
submit
that
the
purposes
espoused
in
coleman
for
the
appointment
of
counsel
at
a
preliminary
hearing
do
not
go
to
that
degree.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
functions
to
be
served
by
counsel
at
a
preliminary
hearing
have
any
substantial
effect
on
the
truth
finding
process
at
a
subsequent
trial.
and
we
do
so
for
the
following
--
we
make
that
assumption
for
the
following
reasons.
addressing
ourselves
point
by
point
to
the
intended
effects
to
be
served
by
the
presence
of
counsel
at
a
preliminary
hearing,
we
have
first
the
prospect
that
the
presence
of
counsel
could
prevent
a
bind
over
to
the
grand
jury
by
cross-examination
and
by
argument
and
he
could
secure
perhaps
a
lower
bail.
bearing
in
mind
that
the
function
of
a
preliminary
hearing
is
only
to
establish
probable
cause,
we
submit
that
those
two
considerations
would
have
no
bearing
on
the
subsequent
trial
would
have
nothing,
no
impact
on
the
truth
finding
process
at
a
trial
and
in
fact
would
be
mooted
by
subsequent
guilty
verdict.
since
the
standard
proof
at
a
trial
is
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
standard
of
proof
at
a
preliminary
hearing
is
merely
a
probable
cause,
we
submit
that
in
effect
a
jury
finding
would
overcome
any
impediment
in
these
two
aspects
that
would
be
suffered
by
the
defendant
by
failure
to
have
the
appointment
of
counsel.
as
to
the
possibility
of
securing
an
early
psychiatric
examination
and
perpetuating
favorable
testimony,
we
submit
first
of
all
that
these
two
considerations
would
occur
very
rarely
in
the
normal
criminal
process.
as
to
the
perpetuation
of
favorable
testimony
there
is
also
this
consideration
that
is
this,
whether
or
not
defense
counsel
would
in
fact
want
to
do
so
bearing
in
mind
that
by
perpetuating
favorable
defense
testimony
he
would
have
to
in
effect
declare
his
defense
prior
to
trial.
now
first
of
all,
preliminary
hearing
generally
takes
place
and
it
is
designed
to
take
place
shortly
after
arrest.
at
that
point,
the
defense
counsel
has
had
a
little
opportunity
to
investigate
into
the
allegations
of
the
state's
case.
so,
generally
he
has
insufficient
knowledge
to
frame
a
defense
bearing
in
mind
that
he
would
want
to
frame
his
defense
only
after
he
has
heard
the
state's
case
or
has
ascertained
the
states
case
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
in
fact
would
want
to
declare
and
interpose
a
defense
and
bind
himself
at
a
subsequent
trial.
mr.
james
e.
gildea
yes
your
honor.
i
am
but
i
am
only
arguing
in
the
sense
that
i
am
addressing
myself
to
whether
or
not
the
failure
to
have
counsel
at
a
preliminary
hearing
will
create
any
substantial
incurment
of
the
truth
finding
process
at
trial
and
that
is
why
i
address
myself
in
that
way
and
perhaps
i
did
not
understand
the
court’s
question.
mr.
james
e.
gildea
that
is
correct
your
honor.
and
in
answering,
attempting
to
answer
that
question,
i
proceed
on
the
basis
of
whether
or
not
the
denial
of
counsel
at
the
preliminary
hearing
would
have
any
substantial
effect
and
in
result
substantial
effect
on
the
truth
finding
process
of
trial
and
addressing
myself
to
the
functions
of
counsel
or
the
purposes
or
the
advantages
to
be
secured
by
counsel
at
a
preliminary
hearing
that
is
espoused
by
court
in
coleman.
addressing
myself
to
those
specific
remarks,
i
feel
that
in
that
connection
by
not
having
counsel
for
that
purpose
the
defendant
would
not
suffer
any
substantial
incurment
as
the
truth
findings
functions
at
trial.
mr.
james
e.
gildea
well,
it
was
not
my
intention
to
say
that
nothing
can
be
accomplished.
i
simply
say
--
mr.
james
e.
gildea
well,
something
can
be
accomplished
but
something
could
also
have
been
accomplished
in
miranda,
something
could
also
have
been
accomplished
in
wade
and
gilbert
and
--
mr.
james
e.
gildea
that
is
correct
but
in
the
resolution
of
--
whether
or
not
this
substantially
affects
a
subsequent
trial.
the
same
things
could
be
said
in
wade
and
stovall
and
gilbert
that
something
could
be
accomplished
but
does
that
mean
by
mere
virtue
of
the
fact
that
something
could
be
accomplished
by
the
presence
of
counsel.
mr.
james
e.
gildea
that
would
be
i
think
a
--
the
very
least
it
could
do
is
just
speculation.
i
do
not
think
that
--
mr.
james
e.
gildea
i
think
there
is
the
possibility
it
could.
it
is
--
again
it
is
matter
of
probabilities
in
degree.
could
we
say
though
in
all
instances
he
would?
i
--
that
i
would
say
no
but
i
would
say
he
could
also
to
the
same
degree
aid
the
truth
finding
process
by
attending
a
lineup.
mr.
james
e.
gildea
well,
it
is
not
a
question
of
waiving
a
preliminary
hearing.
no
your
honor,
i
would
not
waive
a
preliminary
hearing
and
this
is
not
a
question
--
mr.
james
e.
gildea
the
question
is
what
will
a
counsel
do
at
a
preliminary
hearing?
will
he
affect,
do
the
things
that
the
court
--
mr.
james
e.
gildea
he
will
cross-examine,
yes
your
honor.
i
would
think
he
would.
mr.
james
e.
gildea
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
e.
gildea
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
e.
gildea
yes.
it
is
helpful
but
is
that
--
are
there
alternatives
because
that
also
has
to
be
considered.
could
he
by
discovery
ascertain
the
same
things
and
is
it
--
mr.
james
e.
gildea
he
has
the
right
to
interview
witnesses,
he
gets
to
--
he
has
a
right
under
his
pretrial
motions
to
a
list
of
witnesses,
he
can
ascertain
the
identities
of
the
witnesses
and
he
can
talk
to
the
witnesses.
mr.
james
e.
gildea
no,
he
cannot
your
honor.
but
that
may
not
be
critical.
however,
he
has
--
does
have
access
to
their
testimony
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
he
does
have
access
to
the
testimony
before
the
grand
jury
and
he
cannot
frame
questions
during
his
cross-examination
at
trial
in
reference
to
their
testimony
at
these
preliminary
stages.
i
say
these
things
because
the
court
has
remarked
in
stovall
and
i
believe
in
johnson
versus
new
jersey
that
the
question
of
--
is
a
question
of
probabilities
and
mr.
justice
marshall’s
remarks
are
well
taken
but
i
would
say
that
by
the
same
degree,
by
the
same
token
that
griffin
versus
california
could
have
an
effect
on
the
truth
finding
process.
and
in
that
connection
i
would
say
this
--
that
bloom
versus
illinois
and
douglas
versus
louisiana
could
also
have
an
effect
on
the
truth
finding
process
of
trial
and
i
will
also
say
that
miranda
and
gilbert
and
wade
could
also
have
an
effect
on
the
truth
finding
process
but
could
we
say
simply
by
virtue
of
that
fact
that
they
would
have
a
substantial
effect
so
as
to
require
that
in
all
cases
the
rule
should
be
applied
retroactively.
judged
by
the
standards
that
were
employed
in
gilbert
and
wade
and
in
miranda,
we
submit
that
the
defendant
would
suffer
no
greater
adversity
by
the
absence
of
counsel
at
a
preliminary
hearing
than
it
would
in
most
cases.
and
for
that
reason
that
--
the
rule
should
no
more
be
applied
retroactively
here
than
it
would
in
gilbert,
wade
and
miranda.
mr.
james
e.
gildea
i
would
exceed
that
--
i
would
agree
to
that
your
honor
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
bonner
and
in
the
illinois
cases,
the
court
has
held
where
a
defendant
can
show
that
he
suffered
prejudice
or
adversity
by
the
failure
to
appoint
counsel
at
the
preliminary
hearing
then
that
in
itself
will
entitle
them
to
relief.
mr.
james
e.
gildea
yes
your
honor
that
has
been.
mr.
james
e.
gildea
and
that
has
been,
from
the
time
of
morris
at
least
until
the
time
of
morris
on
--
up
to
the
present.
mr.
james
e.
gildea
yes
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
gildea
yes
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
gildea
i
think
it
is
--
mr.
james
e.
gildea
the
due
process
clause,
i
think
it
has
reference
to
perhaps
white
and
hamilton
at
the
same
time.
mr.
james
e.
gildea
that
is
correct
your
honor.
i
might
also
say
that
the
preliminary
hearing
in
illinois
is
not
particularly
suited
for
the
utilization
or
the
gaining
of
the
benefits
that
were
intended
on
the
coleman
rule,
for
example,
that
in
the
state
of
illinois
there
is
no
requirement
that
a
preliminary
hearing
be
attended
by
a
court
reporter
or
a
transcript
be
made
of
the
testimony.
the
court
is
only
required
to
hear
so
much
evidence
as
will
give
rise
to
conclusion
in
his
mind
that
there
is
probable
cause.
that
is
that
the
defendant
--
that
a
crime
was
committed
and
that
this
particular
defendants
before
the
bench
committed
it.
the
presumption
is
therefore
that
the
judge
could
hear
just
testimony
from
one
witness
and
would
not
necessarily
have
to
hear
defense
testimony.
furthermore,
the
testimony
at
a
preliminary
hearing
maybe
based
upon
hearsay
evidence
solely.
and
generally
the
rule
is,
or
the
practice
is,
the
same
as
with
grand
jury
matters
and
that
is
that
the
state
will
only
call
one
witness,
generally
a
police
officer
and
he
will
relate
what
facts
were
revealed
by
the
process
of
his
investigations.
so,
in
reality
there
is
not
that
great
of
an
opportunity
to
secure
material
for
impeachment
and
to
discover
that
much
about
the
state’s
case.
as
to
the
second
criterion
used
by
the
--
or
used
by
the
court
as
practiced
in
determining
whether
or
not
a
case
should
be
held
retroactive
that
being
the
question
of
reliability,
we
submit
that
the
state
of
illinois
did
in
good
faith
rely
upon
prior
standards.
the
only
cases
that
were
before
the
court
concerning
the
question
of
appointment
of
counsel
were
of
course
powell
versus
alabama
which
concerned
itself
with
the
effect
that
--
counsel
at
trial.
i
do
not
believe
that
bears
on
the
coleman
question.
other
than
that
we
had
hamilton
versus
alabama
and
white
versus
maryland.
hamilton
versus
alabama
was
a
question
of
concerning
the
appointments
of
counsel
in
an
arraignment.
now,
in
illinois
counsel
is
required
to
reappoint
arraignment
and
under
hamilton,
of
course
the
arraignment
there
differed,
we
believe
drastically
from
the
preliminary
hearing
in
illinois
in
this
respect
in
hamilton
versus
alabama
of
course,
the
defendant
had
to
assert
rights
there
such
as
a
plea
and
abatement.
a
challenge
to
the
composition
of
the
grand
jury
and
(inaudible),
i
assume
too
or
by
not
doing
so
he
would
forever
waive
those
rights.
now,
under
illinois
law
as
interpreted
in
people
versus
bonner,
there
was
no
binding
effect
that
a
defendant
could
suffer
by
not
having
or
by
not
asserting
any
rights
or
by
not
objecting
to
any
evidence
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
indeed
if
he
testified,
that
testimony
could
not
be
used
against
him
during
a
subsequent
proceeding
and
he
was
not
bound
by
a
failure
to
assert
any
defense.
and
of
course
in
white
versus
maryland
the
–
there,
there
was
a
plea
of
guilty
interposed
by
the
defendant
at
the
preliminary
hearing
which
was
used
at
his
trial.
and
that
ipso
facto
did
bear
upon
the
truth
finding
process
at
the
trial
since
it
was
considered
by
the
trial
court.
now
illinois
as
relied
on
this
distinction
has
pointed
out
the
distinction
in
people
versus
bonner,
in
that
connection
i
would
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
fact
that
we
were
not
alone
in
doing
so.
there
were
some
33
other
jurisdictions
that
also
pointed
to
that
fact
in
distinguishing
their
preliminary
hearings
from
those
in
white
versus
maryland
and
as
against
the
arraignment
proceedings
in
hamilton
versus
alabama
and
as
to
amongst
those
33
other
jurisdictions,
all
of
the
federal
courts
of
appeals
subsequent
to
1963
did
themselves
hold
that
where
the
preliminary
hearing
was
not
such
as
to
bind
--
defend
at
the
trial
that
the
requirement
of
counsel
was
not
of
constitutional
dimension.
so,
we
submit
there
was
no
clear
foreshadowing
of
the
coleman
doctrine
prior
to
the
announcement
of
coleman
that
the
illinois
courts
could
be
bound
by
it.
as
to
the
effect
upon
the
administration
of
justice,
the
appellant
asserts
that
it
is
his
contention
that
this
would
not
affect
a
great
number
of
cases
in
illinois
because
of
the
fact
or
a
great
number
of
cases
anywhere
because
of
the
fact
that
it
is
his
contention
that
the
failure
to
interpose
an
objection
on
that
basis
must
be
considered
a
waiver
and
we
consider
that
--
we
believe
that
that
is
a
misinterpretation
of
the
law
as
stated
by
this
court
in
o’conner
versus
ohio
where
it
said
that
a
defendant
could
not
be
deemed
to
waive
an
objection
to
a
constitutional
question
that
was
subsequently
pronounced
because
it
could
be
no
more
binding
on
him
that
it
could
be
upon
the
states
who
could
not
have
anticipated
such
a
ruling.
so
i
do
not
believe
that
he
is
correct
in
his
say
as
to
that
point.
mr.
james
e.
gildea
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
mr.
james
e.
gildea
whether
there
has
been
an
error
--
a
question
of
substantial
magnitude,
a
constitutional
magnitude,
the
waiver
doctrine
does
not
preclude
the
defendant
from
not
making
that
assertion
at
the
first
time
or
an
appeal
or
in
a
collateral
proceeding.
as
recently
as
1965,
some
two-thirds
of
the
states
of
this
union
did
not
provide
for
the
appointment
of
counsel
at
a
preliminary
hearing.
it
was
not
until
1964
that
the
federal
courts
adopted
section
3060
of
title
18
providing
for
the
appointment
of
counsel
in
federal
cases.
so
that
we
submit
that
there
is
a
vast
number
of
cases
prior
to
1964
and
1965
that
would
have
to
perforce
be
affected
by
any
ruling
by
this
court
holding
the
requirement
of
counsel
at
a
preliminary
hearing
retroactive.
furthermore,
since
in
illinois
and
i
believe
in
many
other
states
a
transcripts
of
the
preliminary
hearing
is
not
required.
it
becomes
a
very
difficult
question
to
determine
how
if
chapman,
if
the
case
is
to
be
remanded
on
the
bases
of
chapman
versus
california
for
a
determination
of
whether
or
not
there
was
harmless
error,
how
could
that
be
established
where
there
was
no
transcript
of
the
preliminary
hearing
in
which
anybody
can
decide
what
in
fact
happened
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
furthermore,
what
criteria
would
be
used
by
the
court
to
decide
whether
or
not
failure
to
cross-examine,
failure
to
object
would
have
any
substantial
effects
on
the
truth
finding
process
of
the
trial?
how
could
that
determination
be
made?
we
are
dealing
in
a
very
naiveties
area.
the
problem
of
finding
change,
there
would
be
no
standards,
no
guidelines
that
the
court
could
use
and
as
to
cases
going
far
back,
i
question
whether
or
not
it
could
even
be
ascertained
at
least
from
the
state's
point
of
view,
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
did
have
the
benefits
of
counsel
or
not.
mr.
james
e.
gildea
that
is
correct
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
e.
gildea
well,
the
rule
has
been
changed
drastically
because
of
the
recent
opinions
and
now
they
are
compelled
to
do
so
for
this
very
reason.
also
addressing
myself
to
one
or
two
remarks
that
were
made
by
my
colleague
in
his
presentation,
i
might
say
that
the
failure
to
move
to
suppress
any
physical
evidence
prefatory
to
trial
is
--
does
not
preclude
the
defendant
from
making
such
a
motion
at
trial.
thank
you.
mr.
james
e.
gildea
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
must
i
forget
to
mention
this
i
would
like
to
first
deviate
from
my
prepared
text
in
connection
with
the
questions
concerning
the
bonner
case
and
justice
schauer's
dissent.
i
would
urge
your
honors
to
consider
the
fact
that
justice
schauer
dissent
at
that
case
did
not
address
itself
to
the
constitutional
question.
it
addressed
itself
to
a
matter
of
statutory
interpretation
as
construed
by
the
majority
of
the
court’s
statutory
interpretation
under
the
illinois
law.
we
had
a
statute
that
provided
that
counsel
was
to
be
appointed
at
the
preliminary
hearing
if
a
defendant
was
indigent.
we
had
another
statute
saying
that
at
the
point
of
arraignment
no
plea
was
to
be
taken
without
appointment
of
counsel.
the
bonner
case
construed
the
two
statutes
to
be
imparting
a
curia
and
held
that
the
two
provisions
required
only
that
counsel
be
appointed
prior
to
any
plea
wherever
interposed
and
justice
schauer
took
umbrage
with
that
and
took
exception
and
it
was
his
opinion
that
the
illinois
statute
provided
otherwise.
however,
he
did
not
dissent
on
the
basis
of
any
constitutional
questions.
as
to
the
factual
background
of
this
case
is
your
honor,
this
case
charged
the
defendant
with
the
sale
of
narcotics
and
it
was
a
what
we
call
a
controlled
sale
and
that
an
informant
was
used
in
connection
with
two
police
officers.
the
defendant
was
arrested
immediately
after
the
alleged
incident
and
he
appeared
in
court
the
following
day.
the
case
was
then
held
on
call
for
one
day
and
continued
variously.
subsequently
there
was
a
preliminary
hearing
and
we
conceive
that
the
counsel
was
not
appointed
by
the
judge
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
there
was
testimony
introduced
at
that
point
from
one
witness,
one
of
the
officers
upon
the
testimony
of
that
officer
the
judge
found
probable
cause
and
held
the
defendant
to
answer
to
the
grand
jury,
indictment
was
returned
and
it
was
not
until
the
day
that
the
case
was
set
for
trial
that
counsel
for
the
defendant
filed
his
motion
in
connection
with
a
claim
for
having
his
constitutional
rights
violative
by
a
failure
to
appoint
counsel
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
and
in
that
connection,
the
motion
that
was
filed
was
a
motion
to
quash
the
indictment.
it
was
not
a
motion
asking
for
a
preliminary
hearing
and
the
defendant
did
not
in
his
motion
alleged
that
he
was
in
fact
indigent
and
therefore
required
the
appointment
of
counsel.
and
furthermore
the
defendant
did
not
allege
that
he
suffered
any
prejudice
during
the
course
of
their
preliminary
hearing.
now,
addressing
myself
to
the
principal
issues
here,
since
linkletter
versus
walker
on
--
down
through
the
recent
cases
that
the
court
pronounced
last
year
in
speaking
in
terms
of
williams
and
hill
and
elkanich.
the
court
has
applied
a
three
fold
test
in
determining
whether
or
not
a
new
constitutional
doctrine
should
be
held
retroactive.
in
that
connection
the
court
has
stated
that
deciding
that
issue
the
court
will
look
first
of
all
to
the
purpose
of
the
new
constitutional
doctrine,
secondly,
to
prior
reliance
on
previous
standards
and
thirdly,
to
the
effect
on
the
administration
of
justice.
addressing
myself,
first
of
all
to
the
purpose
of
the
constitutional
doctrine
as
pronounced
in
coleman
versus
alabama,
the
court
stated
that
the
purpose
was
to
secure
for
a
defendant
advantages
prefatory
to
trial
and
in
that
connection
the
court
mentioned
six
possible
advantages.
the
court
said
that
the
presence
of
counsel
at
a
preliminary
hearing
might
be
effective
in
preventing
a
possible
bind
over
to
the
grand
jury
by
making
effective
arguments
and
cross-examination
or
whatnot.
secondly,
he
could
perhaps
to
secure
a
lower
bail
or
bail
initially
and
he
would
have
some
bearing
or
he
would
have
some
influence
on
that
determination.
thirdly,
by
cross-examination,
he
could
perhaps
create
material
for
impeachment
at
trial.
he
could
discover
the
--
some
of
the
state’s
evidence
that
would
be
used
to
trial.
he
could
perpetuate
favorable
testimony
for
a
later
date
and
then
he
could
secure
an
early
psychiatric
examination.
now,
with
connection
to
the
purpose
--
aspect
of
the
purpose
criterion,
the
court
said
that
where
the
major
purpose
of
a
new
constitutional
doctrine
is
to
overcome
an
aspect
of
the
trial
would
substantially
impair
the
truth
finding
process
so
as
to
create
serious
doubt
as
to
the
reliability
of
a
guilty
verdict.
in
prior
cases
this
court
will
hold
the
doctrine
retroactive.
in
that
connection
we
submit
that
the
purposes
espoused
in
coleman
for
the
appointment
of
counsel
at
a
preliminary
hearing
do
not
go
to
that
degree.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
functions
to
be
served
by
counsel
at
a
preliminary
hearing
have
any
substantial
effect
on
the
truth
finding
process
at
a
subsequent
trial.
and
we
do
so
for
the
following
--
we
make
that
assumption
for
the
following
reasons.
addressing
ourselves
point
by
point
to
the
intended
effects
to
be
served
by
the
presence
of
counsel
at
a
preliminary
hearing,
we
have
first
the
prospect
that
the
presence
of
counsel
could
prevent
a
bind
over
to
the
grand
jury
by
cross-examination
and
by
argument
and
he
could
secure
perhaps
a
lower
bail.
bearing
in
mind
that
the
function
of
a
preliminary
hearing
is
only
to
establish
probable
cause,
we
submit
that
those
two
considerations
would
have
no
bearing
on
the
subsequent
trial
would
have
nothing,
no
impact
on
the
truth
finding
process
at
a
trial
and
in
fact
would
be
mooted
by
subsequent
guilty
verdict.
since
the
standard
proof
at
a
trial
is
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
standard
of
proof
at
a
preliminary
hearing
is
merely
a
probable
cause,
we
submit
that
in
effect
a
jury
finding
would
overcome
any
impediment
in
these
two
aspects
that
would
be
suffered
by
the
defendant
by
failure
to
have
the
appointment
of
counsel.
as
to
the
possibility
of
securing
an
early
psychiatric
examination
and
perpetuating
favorable
testimony,
we
submit
first
of
all
that
these
two
considerations
would
occur
very
rarely
in
the
normal
criminal
process.
as
to
the
perpetuation
of
favorable
testimony
there
is
also
this
consideration
that
is
this,
whether
or
not
defense
counsel
would
in
fact
want
to
do
so
bearing
in
mind
that
by
perpetuating
favorable
defense
testimony
he
would
have
to
in
effect
declare
his
defense
prior
to
trial.
now
first
of
all,
preliminary
hearing
generally
takes
place
and
it
is
designed
to
take
place
shortly
after
arrest.
at
that
point,
the
defense
counsel
has
had
a
little
opportunity
to
investigate
into
the
allegations
of
the
state's
case.
so,
generally
he
has
insufficient
knowledge
to
frame
a
defense
bearing
in
mind
that
he
would
want
to
frame
his
defense
only
after
he
has
heard
the
state's
case
or
has
ascertained
the
states
case
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
in
fact
would
want
to
declare
and
interpose
a
defense
and
bind
himself
at
a
subsequent
trial.
mr.
james
e.
gildea
yes
your
honor.
i
am
but
i
am
only
arguing
in
the
sense
that
i
am
addressing
myself
to
whether
or
not
the
failure
to
have
counsel
at
a
preliminary
hearing
will
create
any
substantial
incurment
of
the
truth
finding
process
at
trial
and
that
is
why
i
address
myself
in
that
way
and
perhaps
i
did
not
understand
the
court’s
question.
mr.
james
e.
gildea
that
is
correct
your
honor.
and
in
answering,
attempting
to
answer
that
question,
i
proceed
on
the
basis
of
whether
or
not
the
denial
of
counsel
at
the
preliminary
hearing
would
have
any
substantial
effect
and
in
result
substantial
effect
on
the
truth
finding
process
of
trial
and
addressing
myself
to
the
functions
of
counsel
or
the
purposes
or
the
advantages
to
be
secured
by
counsel
at
a
preliminary
hearing
that
is
espoused
by
court
in
coleman.
addressing
myself
to
those
specific
remarks,
i
feel
that
in
that
connection
by
not
having
counsel
for
that
purpose
the
defendant
would
not
suffer
any
substantial
incurment
as
the
truth
findings
functions
at
trial.
mr.
james
e.
gildea
well,
it
was
not
my
intention
to
say
that
nothing
can
be
accomplished.
i
simply
say
--
mr.
james
e.
gildea
well,
something
can
be
accomplished
but
something
could
also
have
been
accomplished
in
miranda,
something
could
also
have
been
accomplished
in
wade
and
gilbert
and
--
mr.
james
e.
gildea
that
is
correct
but
in
the
resolution
of
--
whether
or
not
this
substantially
affects
a
subsequent
trial.
the
same
things
could
be
said
in
wade
and
stovall
and
gilbert
that
something
could
be
accomplished
but
does
that
mean
by
mere
virtue
of
the
fact
that
something
could
be
accomplished
by
the
presence
of
counsel.
mr.
james
e.
gildea
that
would
be
i
think
a
--
the
very
least
it
could
do
is
just
speculation.
i
do
not
think
that
--
mr.
james
e.
gildea
i
think
there
is
the
possibility
it
could.
it
is
--
again
it
is
matter
of
probabilities
in
degree.
could
we
say
though
in
all
instances
he
would?
i
--
that
i
would
say
no
but
i
would
say
he
could
also
to
the
same
degree
aid
the
truth
finding
process
by
attending
a
lineup.
mr.
james
e.
gildea
well,
it
is
not
a
question
of
waiving
a
preliminary
hearing.
no
your
honor,
i
would
not
waive
a
preliminary
hearing
and
this
is
not
a
question
--
mr.
james
e.
gildea
the
question
is
what
will
a
counsel
do
at
a
preliminary
hearing?
will
he
affect,
do
the
things
that
the
court
--
mr.
james
e.
gildea
he
will
cross-examine,
yes
your
honor.
i
would
think
he
would.
mr.
james
e.
gildea
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
e.
gildea
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
e.
gildea
yes.
it
is
helpful
but
is
that
--
are
there
alternatives
because
that
also
has
to
be
considered.
could
he
by
discovery
ascertain
the
same
things
and
is
it
--
mr.
james
e.
gildea
he
has
the
right
to
interview
witnesses,
he
gets
to
--
he
has
a
right
under
his
pretrial
motions
to
a
list
of
witnesses,
he
can
ascertain
the
identities
of
the
witnesses
and
he
can
talk
to
the
witnesses.
mr.
james
e.
gildea
no,
he
cannot
your
honor.
but
that
may
not
be
critical.
however,
he
has
--
does
have
access
to
their
testimony
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
he
does
have
access
to
the
testimony
before
the
grand
jury
and
he
cannot
frame
questions
during
his
cross-examination
at
trial
in
reference
to
their
testimony
at
these
preliminary
stages.
i
say
these
things
because
the
court
has
remarked
in
stovall
and
i
believe
in
johnson
versus
new
jersey
that
the
question
of
--
is
a
question
of
probabilities
and
mr.
justice
marshall’s
remarks
are
well
taken
but
i
would
say
that
by
the
same
degree,
by
the
same
token
that
griffin
versus
california
could
have
an
effect
on
the
truth
finding
process.
and
in
that
connection
i
would
say
this
--
that
bloom
versus
illinois
and
douglas
versus
louisiana
could
also
have
an
effect
on
the
truth
finding
process
of
trial
and
i
will
also
say
that
miranda
and
gilbert
and
wade
could
also
have
an
effect
on
the
truth
finding
process
but
could
we
say
simply
by
virtue
of
that
fact
that
they
would
have
a
substantial
effect
so
as
to
require
that
in
all
cases
the
rule
should
be
applied
retroactively.
judged
by
the
standards
that
were
employed
in
gilbert
and
wade
and
in
miranda,
we
submit
that
the
defendant
would
suffer
no
greater
adversity
by
the
absence
of
counsel
at
a
preliminary
hearing
than
it
would
in
most
cases.
and
for
that
reason
that
--
the
rule
should
no
more
be
applied
retroactively
here
than
it
would
in
gilbert,
wade
and
miranda.
mr.
james
e.
gildea
i
would
exceed
that
--
i
would
agree
to
that
your
honor
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
bonner
and
in
the
illinois
cases,
the
court
has
held
where
a
defendant
can
show
that
he
suffered
prejudice
or
adversity
by
the
failure
to
appoint
counsel
at
the
preliminary
hearing
then
that
in
itself
will
entitle
them
to
relief.
mr.
james
e.
gildea
yes
your
honor
that
has
been.
mr.
james
e.
gildea
and
that
has
been,
from
the
time
of
morris
at
least
until
the
time
of
morris
on
--
up
to
the
present.
mr.
james
e.
gildea
yes
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
gildea
yes
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
gildea
i
think
it
is
--
mr.
james
e.
gildea
the
due
process
clause,
i
think
it
has
reference
to
perhaps
white
and
hamilton
at
the
same
time.
mr.
james
e.
gildea
that
is
correct
your
honor.
i
might
also
say
that
the
preliminary
hearing
in
illinois
is
not
particularly
suited
for
the
utilization
or
the
gaining
of
the
benefits
that
were
intended
on
the
coleman
rule,
for
example,
that
in
the
state
of
illinois
there
is
no
requirement
that
a
preliminary
hearing
be
attended
by
a
court
reporter
or
a
transcript
be
made
of
the
testimony.
the
court
is
only
required
to
hear
so
much
evidence
as
will
give
rise
to
conclusion
in
his
mind
that
there
is
probable
cause.
that
is
that
the
defendant
--
that
a
crime
was
committed
and
that
this
particular
defendants
before
the
bench
committed
it.
the
presumption
is
therefore
that
the
judge
could
hear
just
testimony
from
one
witness
and
would
not
necessarily
have
to
hear
defense
testimony.
furthermore,
the
testimony
at
a
preliminary
hearing
maybe
based
upon
hearsay
evidence
solely.
and
generally
the
rule
is,
or
the
practice
is,
the
same
as
with
grand
jury
matters
and
that
is
that
the
state
will
only
call
one
witness,
generally
a
police
officer
and
he
will
relate
what
facts
were
revealed
by
the
process
of
his
investigations.
so,
in
reality
there
is
not
that
great
of
an
opportunity
to
secure
material
for
impeachment
and
to
discover
that
much
about
the
state’s
case.
as
to
the
second
criterion
used
by
the
--
or
used
by
the
court
as
practiced
in
determining
whether
or
not
a
case
should
be
held
retroactive
that
being
the
question
of
reliability,
we
submit
that
the
state
of
illinois
did
in
good
faith
rely
upon
prior
standards.
the
only
cases
that
were
before
the
court
concerning
the
question
of
appointment
of
counsel
were
of
course
powell
versus
alabama
which
concerned
itself
with
the
effect
that
--
counsel
at
trial.
i
do
not
believe
that
bears
on
the
coleman
question.
other
than
that
we
had
hamilton
versus
alabama
and
white
versus
maryland.
hamilton
versus
alabama
was
a
question
of
concerning
the
appointments
of
counsel
in
an
arraignment.
now,
in
illinois
counsel
is
required
to
reappoint
arraignment
and
under
hamilton,
of
course
the
arraignment
there
differed,
we
believe
drastically
from
the
preliminary
hearing
in
illinois
in
this
respect
in
hamilton
versus
alabama
of
course,
the
defendant
had
to
assert
rights
there
such
as
a
plea
and
abatement.
a
challenge
to
the
composition
of
the
grand
jury
and
(inaudible),
i
assume
too
or
by
not
doing
so
he
would
forever
waive
those
rights.
now,
under
illinois
law
as
interpreted
in
people
versus
bonner,
there
was
no
binding
effect
that
a
defendant
could
suffer
by
not
having
or
by
not
asserting
any
rights
or
by
not
objecting
to
any
evidence
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
indeed
if
he
testified,
that
testimony
could
not
be
used
against
him
during
a
subsequent
proceeding
and
he
was
not
bound
by
a
failure
to
assert
any
defense.
and
of
course
in
white
versus
maryland
the
–
there,
there
was
a
plea
of
guilty
interposed
by
the
defendant
at
the
preliminary
hearing
which
was
used
at
his
trial.
and
that
ipso
facto
did
bear
upon
the
truth
finding
process
at
the
trial
since
it
was
considered
by
the
trial
court.
now
illinois
as
relied
on
this
distinction
has
pointed
out
the
distinction
in
people
versus
bonner,
in
that
connection
i
would
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
fact
that
we
were
not
alone
in
doing
so.
there
were
some
33
other
jurisdictions
that
also
pointed
to
that
fact
in
distinguishing
their
preliminary
hearings
from
those
in
white
versus
maryland
and
as
against
the
arraignment
proceedings
in
hamilton
versus
alabama
and
as
to
amongst
those
33
other
jurisdictions,
all
of
the
federal
courts
of
appeals
subsequent
to
1963
did
themselves
hold
that
where
the
preliminary
hearing
was
not
such
as
to
bind
--
defend
at
the
trial
that
the
requirement
of
counsel
was
not
of
constitutional
dimension.
so,
we
submit
there
was
no
clear
foreshadowing
of
the
coleman
doctrine
prior
to
the
announcement
of
coleman
that
the
illinois
courts
could
be
bound
by
it.
as
to
the
effect
upon
the
administration
of
justice,
the
appellant
asserts
that
it
is
his
contention
that
this
would
not
affect
a
great
number
of
cases
in
illinois
because
of
the
fact
or
a
great
number
of
cases
anywhere
because
of
the
fact
that
it
is
his
contention
that
the
failure
to
interpose
an
objection
on
that
basis
must
be
considered
a
waiver
and
we
consider
that
--
we
believe
that
that
is
a
misinterpretation
of
the
law
as
stated
by
this
court
in
o’conner
versus
ohio
where
it
said
that
a
defendant
could
not
be
deemed
to
waive
an
objection
to
a
constitutional
question
that
was
subsequently
pronounced
because
it
could
be
no
more
binding
on
him
that
it
could
be
upon
the
states
who
could
not
have
anticipated
such
a
ruling.
so
i
do
not
believe
that
he
is
correct
in
his
say
as
to
that
point.
mr.
james
e.
gildea
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
mr.
james
e.
gildea
whether
there
has
been
an
error
--
a
question
of
substantial
magnitude,
a
constitutional
magnitude,
the
waiver
doctrine
does
not
preclude
the
defendant
from
not
making
that
assertion
at
the
first
time
or
an
appeal
or
in
a
collateral
proceeding.
as
recently
as
1965,
some
two-thirds
of
the
states
of
this
union
did
not
provide
for
the
appointment
of
counsel
at
a
preliminary
hearing.
it
was
not
until
1964
that
the
federal
courts
adopted
section
3060
of
title
18
providing
for
the
appointment
of
counsel
in
federal
cases.
so
that
we
submit
that
there
is
a
vast
number
of
cases
prior
to
1964
and
1965
that
would
have
to
perforce
be
affected
by
any
ruling
by
this
court
holding
the
requirement
of
counsel
at
a
preliminary
hearing
retroactive.
furthermore,
since
in
illinois
and
i
believe
in
many
other
states
a
transcripts
of
the
preliminary
hearing
is
not
required.
it
becomes
a
very
difficult
question
to
determine
how
if
chapman,
if
the
case
is
to
be
remanded
on
the
bases
of
chapman
versus
california
for
a
determination
of
whether
or
not
there
was
harmless
error,
how
could
that
be
established
where
there
was
no
transcript
of
the
preliminary
hearing
in
which
anybody
can
decide
what
in
fact
happened
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
furthermore,
what
criteria
would
be
used
by
the
court
to
decide
whether
or
not
failure
to
cross-examine,
failure
to
object
would
have
any
substantial
effects
on
the
truth
finding
process
of
the
trial?
how
could
that
determination
be
made?
we
are
dealing
in
a
very
naiveties
area.
the
problem
of
finding
change,
there
would
be
no
standards,
no
guidelines
that
the
court
could
use
and
as
to
cases
going
far
back,
i
question
whether
or
not
it
could
even
be
ascertained
at
least
from
the
state's
point
of
view,
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
did
have
the
benefits
of
counsel
or
not.
mr.
james
e.
gildea
that
is
correct
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
e.
gildea
well,
the
rule
has
been
changed
drastically
because
of
the
recent
opinions
and
now
they
are
compelled
to
do
so
for
this
very
reason.
also
addressing
myself
to
one
or
two
remarks
that
were
made
by
my
colleague
in
his
presentation,
i
might
say
that
the
failure
to
move
to
suppress
any
physical
evidence
prefatory
to
trial
is
--
does
not
preclude
the
defendant
from
making
such
a
motion
at
trial.
thank
you.
