unknown
speaker
he
must
go
to
the
preliminary
hearing?
unknown
speaker
exactly
what
you
are
telling
us
about,
preliminary
hearing
practices.
are
these
preliminary
hearings
before
or
after
the
constitutional
hearings?
unknown
speaker
has
the
practices
or
functions
have
changed
with
a
new
constitution
amendment?
unknown
speaker
why
in
gilbert
we
said
that
a
counsel
at
a
lineup
that
--
in
those
decisions,
we
said
stovall
was
not
retroactive?
unknown
speaker
why
--
and
those
two
could
turn
on
harmless
error
in
the
case
of
preliminary
hearings?
how
do
you
distinguish
--
why
should
this
be
retroactive
on
the
primary
counsel
lineup?
unknown
speaker
but
we
did
say
in
court
that
even
if
he
does
not
have
one
in
lineup
if
it
is
a
--
it
has
established
that
the
absence
of
counsel
was
harmless
error
than
a
--
the
absence
of
counsel
at
a
preliminary
hearing?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
it
might
be
harmless
error
that
even
after
the
preliminary
hearing
also
could
be
fair
even
though
there
was
no
counsel
present.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
on
your
approach
--
unknown
speaker
would
there
be
any
room
for
harmless
error?
unknown
speaker
in
your
approach.
unknown
speaker
yes,
and
then
to
that
extent
would
we
not
have
to
modify
or
overrule
what
we
said
about
harmless
error
in
coleman?
unknown
speaker
well
that
makes
--
but
is
it
not
rather
inconsistent
to
say
that
maybe
harmless
error
even
in
situations
respectively
were
spoken
about,
do
you
say
that
coleman
per
se
actively
retroactive.
unknown
speaker
mr.
genson,
while
we
have
you
interrupted,
was
the
illinois
court
unanimous
in
its
decision
here?
unknown
speaker
if
he
went
along
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
does
illinois
concede
the
possibility
even
if
you
are
--
if
we
agreed
with
you
that
there
should
not
be
retroactivity
of
a
due
process
exception
as
to
cases
preceding
coleman?
unknown
speaker
is
that
been
the
illinois
rule
before
coleman?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
that
is
based
on
the
federal
constitution
not
on
illinois
law?

speaker
