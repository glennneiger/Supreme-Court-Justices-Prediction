mr.
david
a.
scholl
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
instituted
by
38
named
plaintiffs
on
behalf
of
a
class
of
all
persons
in
pennsylvania
who
would
sign
contracts
containing
confession-of-judgment
clauses.
i
will
refer
to
the
appellants
in
discussing
this
case
as
the
consumers
since
they
are
all
consumers
and
the
appellees
as
the
creditors.
i
would
also
like
permission
to
request
that
five
minutes
of
my
time
be
reserved
for
rebuttal.
the
pennsylvania
state
--
we
have
a
law
in
pennsylvania
that
permitted
and
in
fact,
did
in
the
case
of
these
38
named
consumers,
the
prothonotary
who
is
merely
a
court
clerk
to
ministerially
enter
judgments
against
the
consumers
without
their
having
had
any
notice
nor
opportunity
to
be
heard
prior
to
the
entry
of
that
judgment.
now,
the
reason
that,
the
only
thing
that
authorized
the
prothonotary
to
do
this
other
than
the
state
law
was
a
clause
which
was
contained
in
the
contracts
that
each
of
the
consumer
signed.
this
clause,
of
course
is
the
confession-of-judgment
clause
and
i
think
that
there
are
two
significant
characteristics
of
the
confession-of-judgment
clause.
first,
it
is
one
of
the
many
clauses
that
it
is
very
in
prime
fine
print
in
contract.
it
is
a
difficult
clause
to
understand,
many
attorneys
do
not
understand
what
the
effect
of
the
clause
is.
and
i
think
a
second
important
aspect,
is
that
confession-of-judgment
clauses
are
contained
in
almost
every
contract
in
pennsylvania
and
which
credits
is
extended
in
any
form.
that
is
to
say,
loan
contracts,
retail
installment
sale
contracts,
in
leases,
there
is
a
confession-of-judgment
and
ejectment,
and
of
course
also
in
mortgage
contracts.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
yes.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
yes,
there
is
your
honor.
there
are
80
exhibits.
actually,
there
are
81
exhibits,
80
of
the
exhibits
are
contracts,
so
that
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
yes,
they
are
the
contracts
that
each
of
the
main
plaintiffs
signed
in
the
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
your
honor,
there
was
no
appendix
in
this
case,
so
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
as
we
move
that
to
proceed
in
the
original
record.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
that
is
right
your
honor.
now,
the
confession-of-judgment
that
the
prothonotary
may
enter,
may
be
entered
immediately.
after
the
contract
is
signed,
that
is
it
can
be
entered
even
before
there
is
any
allegation
of
fault.
it
can
be
entered
the
same
day
that
the
contract
is
executed.
it
cannot
immediately
serve
as
the
basis
for
execution
and
sale
of
the
consumers’
property.
however,
all
that,
the
creditor
need
to
do
it
at
that
point
to
execute
and
sale
the
consumers
property
is
to
file
ex
parte
in
averment
that
the
consumer
has
defaulted.
now,
what
notice
does
the
consumer
get
to
the
proceedings
that
are
occurring
against
him?
well,
after
the
judgment
is
entered,
he
is
required
to
get
notice
of
the
entry
of
the
judgment.
however,
the
property
of
the
consumer
can
be
sold
as
short
as
20
days
after
the
notice
of
the
entry
of
judgment
is
given.
also,
if
there
is
a
sale
of
the
consumer’s
real
estate,
he
is
given
notice
that
the
writ
of
execution
has
been
issued
against
this
real
estate
and
also
he
is
given
notice
of
the
sale
of
his
property.
however,
this
is
generally
by
publication
although,
there
must
also
be
notice
by
mail
and
that
notice
by
mail
may
be
as
little
as
10
days
before
the
property
is
sold.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
i
think
if
it
would
be
noticed
that
the
consumer
would
have
an
opportunity
at
a
hearing
to
raise
any
defenses
that
he
might
have
before
execution
in
sale
could
proceed
on
the
confessed
judgment,
then
i
think
that
it
would
comport
with
due
process.
of
course,
that
is
not
what
is
assured
by
the
pennsylvania
confession-of-judgment
statutes
and
rules.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
that
is
right,
there
is
really
only
one
procedure
by
which
the
consumer
can
possibly
stop
the
sale
of
his
property
and
that
is
by
petitioning
to
open
or
to
strike
the
judgment.
now,
what
happens
when
someone
petitions
or
opens
to
strike
to
judgment?
mr.
david
a.
scholl
no,
he
does
not
receive
that
notice.
he
never
receives
any
notice
prior
to
the
entry
of
the
confessed
judgment.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
oh,
i
am
sorry.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
the
only
thing
that
he
can
do
is
to
petition
to
open
or
to
strike
the
judgment.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
the
point
is
that
in
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
he
never
gets
that
notice.
there
is
no
requirement
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
if
it
is
prior
to
the
entry
of
judgment,
he
would
be
able
to
go
in
the
court
and
attempt
to
enjoin
the
creditor
from
obtaining
the
judgment,
that
is
the
only
thing
i
can
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
the
problem
is
that
the
pennsylvania
procedures
do
not
provide
any
entry
or
any
notice
prior
to
the
entry
of
judgment.
and
in
fact,
i
know
of
no
instance
and
certainly
that
was
not
the
case
in
any
of
the
named
plaintiffs
cases
in
which
the
notice
of
the
judgment
was
to
be
entered
was
provided
to
the
consumer
prior
to
the
entry
of
judgment.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
that
would
be
a
different
case
and
i
think
perhaps,
in
that
case,
depending
on
what
the
notice
was
and
what
opportunity
the
consumer
would,
have
to
come
in
and
present
his
defenses,
what
you
are
suggesting
may
comport
with
due
process
of
law.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
the
problem
that
i
have
is
what
he
could
do
prior
to
the
entry
of
judgment.
i
think
that
what
mr.
justice
marshall
was
suggesting
was
that
person
would
obtain
notice
prior
to
the
entry
of
judgment
and
i
think
the
only
thing
that
could
possibly
be
done
is
bringing
some
kind
of
an
injunction
action
to
prevent
the
creditor
from
proceeding.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
that
is
correct.
he
can
do
it
and
the
prothonotary
would
enter
it
anyway.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
that
is
the
only
procedure
i
can
conceive
of.
the
prothonotary
has
no
digression,
he
must
enter
the
judgment.
the
state
statute
says
that
he
must
enter
the
judgment
as
long
as
he
is
presented
with
the
document
that
contains
a
confession-of-judgment
clause
in
it.
now,
as
i
had
mentioned,
there
is
of
course,
the
procedure
to
petition
to
open
or
to
strike
the
judgment.
however,
this
is
simply
a
procedure
that
is
provided
in
pennsylvania
as
in
most
jurisdictions
to
obtain
relief
from
any
judgment.
it
is
a
petition
that
is
directed
to
the
court’s
discretion
and
the
court,
it
must
be
shown,
the
consumer
must
come
forward
and
show
that
he
has
a
meritorious
defense
before
the
judgment
will
be
open
and
he
even
gets
an
opportunity
to
come
in
and
have
a
hearing
on
his
motion.
this
of
course,
would
deny
him
the
right
to
any
jury
trial
to
determine
whether
the
defense
that
he
is
claiming
is
a
meritorious
defense.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
yes,
then
there
is
a
hearing
on
the
merits,
if
the
judgment
is
open
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
then
you
could
obtain
a
jury
trial
after
the
judgment
is
open.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
yes,
he
could
have
a
jury
determination
after
the
judgment
is
open
but
the
problem
with
the
pennsylvania
procedure
is
that
he
must
come
forward
and
show
that
he
has
a
meritorious
defense
before
a
judge
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
he
presents
whatever
evidence
he
can,
usually,
he
has
to
proceed
by
depositions,
is
another
aspect
of
confession-of-judgment
is
that
the
burden
of
proof
switches
but
also
that
the
costs
are
increased,
where
the
consumer
must
come
forward
and
present
his
defenses
through
a
petition
to
open
a
strike
rather
than
proceeding
in
the
normal
proceeding,
answering
a
complaint.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
the
new
confession
rules
do
provide
that
he
can
take
testimony.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
i
suppose
he
could
try
it.
he
could
proceed
with
only
affidavits.
but
the
problem
is
of
course
that
he
would
not
have
a
jury
trial
at
that
stage,
which
determines
that
he
actually
has
a
meritorious
defense.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
that
is
right.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
now,
the
court
below
recognized
that
in
fact,
the
opening
in
striking
procedure
did
change
the
burden
of
proof
and
that
it
did
significantly
increase
the
costs
that
the
consumer
would
ordinarily
have
in
the
complaint
answer
proceeding.
and
the
court
below
further
declared
that
confession-of-judgment,
at
least
for
the
class
on
whose
behalf
it
held
that
the
action
could
be
maintained
did
violate
due
process
of
law.
essentially,
the
court
held
that
since
the
consumer
did
not
have
any
notice
nor
any
opportunity
to
be
heard
prior
to
the
entry
of
judgment
that
therefore,
he
was
denied
due
process
of
law.
however,
the
court
below
did
make
three
exceptions
from
the
ruling
that
the
consumers
urge
below.
the
more
the
consumers
urge
that
the
pennsylvania
confession
statutes
and
rules
be
declared
unconstitutional
on
their
face.
the
court
below
instead
declared
that,
yes,
it
is
unconstitutional
for
a
certain
group
of
people
but
it
is
not
unconstitutional
regarding
three
specific
classes
of
persons.
now,
the
first
class
which
should
accept
it
was
all
persons
wherein
$10,000.00
or
more
annually.
person
earning
more
than
$10,000.00
confessed
judgment
could
be
entered,
executed
and
serve
as
the
basis
for
sale
against
him.
secondly,
it
made
an
exception
for
all
persons
who
signed
mortgages
are
actually
signed
confession
clauses
as
their
signed
bonds
and
warrants
and
notes
that
contain
confession-of-judgment
clauses
which
are
company
mortgages
so
that
in
any
mortgage
transaction,
a
person
could
also
validly
sign
a
confession-of-judgment
that
it
would
serve
its
execution
and
sale
of
his
property.
and
the
third
exception
at
the
court
made,
the
court
said
that
well,
if
at
a
prior
hearing
and
well
it
did
not
set
down,
how
the
procedure
would
be
carried
out.
it
could
be
showed
that
the
consumer
voluntarily,
knowingly,
and
intelligently
waive
his
due
process
rights,
then
in
that
case
too,
the
confessed
judgment
could
be
entered
and
served
as
basis
for
execution
and
sale
of
the
consumers
property.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
which
forms
are
you
speaking
about?
mr.
david
a.
scholl
it
is
not
in
a
separate
printed
form,
what
it
is,
is
a,
usually,
it
is
one
clause
in
a
contract
that
contains
numerous
other
clauses,
as
i
think
probably
the
best
reference
point
for,
your
honor,
would
be
the
exhibits
in
this
case.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
oh!
mr.
david
a.
scholl
i
think
it
is
here
somewhere.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
yes,
well,
it
is
difficult
to
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well
it
is
use
in
practically
every
contract.
every
contract
in
pennsylvania
wherein
credit
is
extended
in
any
form,
most
every
contract,
retail
installment
sale
contracts,
bonds
and
warranted
mortgages,
somewhere
in
there.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
yes,
they
printed
form.
in
fact
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
they
are
standardized
forms.
in
fact,
some
of
the
exhibits
that
we
have
included
are
simply
forms
that
we
got
from
the
local
stationery
store,
and
they
all
contain
confession-of-judgment
clauses
in
the
body.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
no,
there
was
no
cross-appeal.
the
only
party
that
is
appealed
are
the
consumers.
we
are
appealing
that
from
the
decision
failing
to
declare
confession-of-judgment
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
there
has
been
no
cross-appeal.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
lennox
is
the
--
or
he
was,
he
is
recently
been,
or
i
guess
he
still
is
officially
the
sheriff
of
philadelphia
county.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
he
is
the
person
who
has
the
duty
of
executing
and
selling
the
property
of
the
consumers.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
lennox
took
no
cross-appeal,
that
is
correct.
now,
i
think
it
is
perhaps
well
to
focus
on
the
three
exceptions
that
the
court
made
and
how
easily
these
exceptions
might
be
used
as
a
device
of
circumvention
of
the
entire
fact
of
the
decision
below.
for
instance,
the
court
says
that
in
any
case,
where
there
is
a
mortgage
and
a
bond
and
warrant
and
note
accompanying
that
mortgage
that
if
the
consumers
signs
that,
well,
then
you
can
confess
judgment
against
it.
now,
the
court
does
not
restrict
however,
if
the
transaction
to
purchase
money
mortgage.
mortgage
can
in
fact,
be
taken
by
a
creditor
in
any
transaction.
it
can
be
taken
in
a
loan
transaction.
a
chattel
mortgage
could
be
taken
in
a
retail
or
installment
sale
transaction.
and
in
fact,
there
was
much
evidence
that
this
is
exactly
what
was
happening
in
philadelphia
county
prior
to
the
time
that
mr.
justice
brennan
issued
a
stay
order
which
stopped
all
executions
and
sales
on
confessed
judgments
in
philadelphia
county.
the
$10,000.00
and
over
exception
has
also
been
circumvented
by
simply
requiring
that
a
borrower
filed
an
affidavit,
at
the
time
that
he
take
out
a
loan
or
whatever
harbor
he
is
retaining
credit
that
he
earns
$10,000.00
and
over
a
year.
and
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
creditor
should
have
the
leverage
to
get
the
mortgage
or
to
get
the
affidavit
from
the
consumer.
because
of
course,
before
he
was
able
to
get
the
confession-of-judgment
clause,
why
not
just
ask
the
consumer
to
sign
one
more
paper
which
in
fact,
has
the
same
effect.
i
think
there
is
also
a
problem
with
the
other
exception
that
the
court
set
out,
the
voluntary
knowing
and
intelligent
waiver
hearing
which
is
to
be
held.
the
court
below
sets
no
procedure
on
how
this
is
to
take
place.
the
way
they
usually
were
scheduled
in
philadelphia
county
after
the
decision
was
by
petition
and
rule
to
show
cause
upon
the
consumer.
of
course,
the
consumer
gets
this
petition
that
says,
he
has
to
come
in
and
show
that
he
did
not
knowingly,
voluntarily,
intelligently
waive
his
rights.
this
does
not
apprise
him
of
actually
what
the
significance
of
that
hearing
is
going
to
be.
the
consumers
never
apprised
that
if
it
is
shown
in
fact,
that
he
knowingly,
voluntarily
and
intelligently
waived
his
rights
that
he
is
not
going
to
have
any
hearing
on
the
merits
of
any
defenses
that
he
might
have.
also,
the
court
below
focuses
in
its
discussion
although,
it
says
knowingly,
voluntarily
and
intelligently
on
an
understanding
waiver
by
the
creditor
at
the
time
that
the
contract
is
signed.
therefore,
we
have
the
anomalous
result
of
somebody
who
understands
the
confession-of-judgment
clause
and
perhaps
went
to
a
lawyer
and
asked
the
lawyer
to
explain
the
contract
that
he
is
signing
before
he
signed
it,
he
is
now
accepted
from
the
class.
because
he
knows
or
he
understood
what
confession-of-judgment
was
at
the
time
that
he
signed
it.
the
person
who
does
not
know
what
it
is
or
perhaps
is
not
prudent
enough
to
go
to
a
lawyer,
he
does
not
understandingly
waive
his
rights
therefore
he
is
protected
by
the
court’s
decision.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
excuse
me?
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
i
think
that
there
is
a
practical
problem
if
somebody
showing
that
somebody
actually
voluntarily,
knowingly,
and
intelligently
waives
his
rights.
it
is
like,
i
will
discuss
it.
i
do
not
think
it
is
possible
but
i
think
one
of
the
problems
is
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
no,
what
i
am
focusing
on
your
honor
is
the
notice
that
the
consumer
gets.
all
the
consumer
gets
is
notice
that
he
is
going
to
have
a
hearing
and
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
if
it
can
be
posited
that
a
person
knew
exactly
what
the
significance
of
that
hearing
was
going
to
be,
that
would
mean,
he
would
not
be
able
to
raise
any
defenses
that
he
might
have,
or
perhaps
this
exception
might
make
some
sense
but
the
court,
as
i
said
in
the
opinion,
when
they
discussed
the
waiver
hearing
speak
only
of
understanding
whether
the
person
understood
what
the
clause
meant
at
that
time
and
i
think
that
if
we
look
closer
at
the
court’s
analysis
of
waiver,
we
see
that
the
court
did
not
really
focus
on
the
elements
of
voluntary,
knowing,
and
intelligent
in
its
discussion.
the
court
below
says,
it
a
matter
of
fact,
--
and
i
think
this
is
where
the
court
begins
to
err
in
its
analysis
and
i
think
this
is
what
led
it
to
the
exceptions.
it
says
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
yes
i
do
your
honor.
i
do
object
that
assertion
and
the
reason
that
i
object
to
that
assertion
is
that,
in
a
confession-of-judgment
clause,
what
is
in
fact,
being
waived
is
due
process
itself.
what
somebody
is
waiving
is
any
notice
or
opportunity
to
be
heard
prior
to
the
judgment.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
although,
i
think
that
it
is
well
to
focus
on
the
elements
of
voluntary
and
intelligence
to
see
whether
in
fact,
there
could
be
a
voluntary
and
intelligent
waiver
also,
it
is
also
our
position
that
even
if
you
could
show
that
there
was
a
voluntary
and
knowing
and
intelligent
waiver
that
nevertheless
such
a
waiver
simply
should
not
be
acceptable
to
this
court.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
thank
you.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
what
we
want
to
do
is
prevent
the
burden
of
proof
from
being
shifted
ordinarily
in
an
adversary
proceeding
when
one
person
comes
forward
and
attempts
to
get
the
property
of
another
person,
he
has
the
burden
of
showing
to
the
court
by
a
clear
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
he
is
entitled
to
the
other
person’s
property.
the
pennsylvania
due
process
or
confession-of-judgment
procedure
shifts
that
burden
of
proof.
the
creditor
gets
the
confessed
judgment
right
in
the
beginning
and
the
consumer
will
spend
all
his
time
trying
to
somehow
get
rid
of
that
judgment
that
he
has
against
them.
it
switches
around
the
entire
adversary
proceeding
and
the
only
way
that
he
can
do
this
is
by
coming
in
and
showing
to
the
court
in
a
petition
to
open
or
strike
that
in
fact,
he
by
a
clear
preponderance,
the
evidence
has
a
meritorious
defense.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
i
think
that
is
a
very
difficult
question
your
honor
and
i
think
it
is
so
difficult
that
the
consumers
do
not
want
to
urge
for
anything
that
is
unreasonable.
i
do
not
think,
for
instance,
that
we
would
urge
that
any
judgments
that
have
been
entered
by
expunge
or
we
would
not
urge
that,
in
any
case.
i
think
that
what
we
would
urge
is
that
there
be,
that
there
be
no
more
execution
in
sales
on
even
the
judgments
that
have
been
entered
in
the
past.
that
in
the
future,
there
be
no
more
entrance
of
judgment.
now,
the
land
title
association
brief
of
course
raises
the
issue
of
retroactivity
and
i
would
like
to
comment
on
what
they
say
and
i
think
that
we
actually
concur
with
the
land
title
association’s
position
which
is
that
any
decision
on
entry
should
not
in
any
sense
be
retroactive
and
that
regarding
executions
in
sales
that
a
decision
on
that
be
retroactive
only
since
january
26,
1970.
the
reason
that
i
choose
that
date,
it
is
a
date
that
the
land
title
associations
indicate
that
they
advise
all
of
their
members
that
they
should
be
careful
in
the
future
about
insuring
titles
on
confessed
judgment.
and
i
think
that
was
a
point
at
which
the
hardship
factor
that
may
weigh
against
a
fully
retroactive
decision,
sort
of
changes
over
and
that
it
is
not
at
that
point
so
important
because
at
that
point
the
land
title
associations
were
unnoticed.
that
in
fact,
confession-of-judgment
probably
or
possibly
was
constitutionally
deficient.
i
would
just
like
to
say
a
few
words
about
whether
the
waiver
can
ever
be
a
voluntary
in
the
confession-of-judgment
situation.
i
think
that
perhaps
the
case
before
this
has
highlighted
several
of
actually,
the
distinctions
here.
what
we
are
concerned
with
in
this
case
is
a
clause
that
is
contained
in
almost
every
contract
in
pennsylvania
and
the
parties
that
are
negotiating
here
are
not
two
corporations,
they
are
in
fact,
the
consumer
who
probably
would
not
even
know
what
confession-of-judgment
was.
much
less
would
be
effective
it
is
in
a
company
which
uses
a
standard
form
and
understands
of
course,
perfectly
what
confession-of-judgment
means.
or
the
consumer
in
fact,
is
put
in
a
position
where
either
has
to
sign
the
contract
that
contains
the
confession-of-judgment
clause
or
he
has
to
do
without
credit.
he
is
put
in
the
situation
almost
the
classic,
adhesion
contract
situation,
and
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
there
is
not
a
voluntary
waiver
of
the
due
process
rights
for
the
consumers.
it
may
be
valid.
there
may
be
a
voluntary
waiver
for
some
corporations
although
in
pennsylvania
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
i
think
that
we
are
because
there
is
certainly
nothing
in
the
statute
that
distinguishes
persons
who
voluntarily
waive
their
rights
or
corporations
from
individuals.
i
think
that
the
statute
as
it
is
drawn
affects
all
persons
and
i
think
that
the
court,
the
lower
court
could
only
have
come
to
the
conclusion,
well,
it
is
alright
for
corporation
but
it
is
not
alright
for
individuals
if
it
could
have
found
that
the
statute
was
in
fact
severable
and
if
the
legislature
would
have
intended
to
retain
a
statute
that
said
well,
a
confession-of-judgment
is
alright
for
corporations
but
it
is
not
alright
for
consumers.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
no.
in
fact,
we
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
it
just
applies
to
individual.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
i
think
the
basis
was
that
we
did
not
present
to
the
court
any
consumers
that
earned
over
$10,000.00
and
they
felt
that
we
had
failed
to
meet
our
burden
of
proof
on
that
issue.
they
also
had
suggested
another
argument,
they
say
that
well
maybe
these
poor
people
could
not
adequately
represent
the
people
that
earn
over
$10,000.00
because
those
people
might
want
to
retain
confession
of
judgment
because
now
the
confession
is
gone,
it
might
be
harder
to
get
credit.
well,
i
think
that
there
is
a
problem
with
that
reasoning
and
the
problem
is
that
the
person
that
is
earning
over
$10,000.00
as
an
income
which
is
security
prohibited.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
that
is
true
too.
there
is
no
determination
made
as
to
whether
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
that
is
right.
i
think
where
the
court
erred
in
that
discussion
is
assuming
that
we
had
to
show
for
every
group
of
income
people
that
in
fact,
they
were
in
the
same
boat,
so
to
speak
as
to
the
loan.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
they
made
no
decision
on
the
statute
on
its
face.
the
statutes
still
retained
but
the
court
said
it
is
just
as
applied
to
this
group
of
people
who
earn
under
$10,000.00
and
none
more
be
jurors.
that
group
of
people
is
now
going
to
be
protected
from
confessed
judgments
being
entered
and
executed
and
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
our
quarrel
is
that,
we
do
not
feel
that
there
is
any
distinction
between
persons
that
earn
over
$10,000
and
those
that
are
not.
in
fact,
had
the
court
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
one
of
the
named
plaintiffs,
i
think
does
earn
over
$10,000.00
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
no,
i
believe
there
is
one
person
that
is
appealing
that
earns
over
$10,000,00
but
i
will
concede
that
perhaps,
that
is
another
case
but
i
do
not
think
that
what
the
court
should
do
is
built
in,
in
its
decisions
other
cases.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
yes.
a
person
can
still
be
extracted
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
that
is
right,
as
the
hearing
would
not
even
come
up
unless
the
person
earns
under
$10,000.00.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
that
is
right.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
that
is
right.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
right.
that
hearing
takes
place
and
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
the
court
does
not
say
that,
how
that
hearing
used
to
take
place;
the
way
it
has
been
taking
place
is
by
petition
and
rule
in
philadelphia
county
which
i
do
not
think
is
an
adequate
substitute.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
he
has
to
do
something
to
have
that
hearing.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
that
is
right.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
no,
in
fact,
in
answer
to
mr.
justice’s
white
particularly
on
that
point,
we
would
urge
that
in
fact,
what
is
in
question
here
is
a
waiver
of
the
entirety
of
due
process.
it
is
a
waiver
of
any
notice
and
opportunity
to
be
heard
prior
to
the
entry
of
judgment
and
prior
to
something
which
can
lead
to
the
taking
away
of
a
person’s
property
on
that
such
a
waiver
is
simply
invalid
on
its
face
because
it
is
a
waiver
of
due
process
and
that
is
something
that
this
court
simply
cannot
permit
to
take
place
under
our
form
of
government.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
that
is
right.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
it
seems
that
where
they
got
it
was
from
one
piece
of
evidence
that
we
introduced
a
study
taken
by
dr.
david
caplovitz
of
the
columbia
university
bureau
of
applied
social
research
in
new
york.
david
caplovitz
had
studied
the
attitudes
of
persons
who
he
termed
default
debtors,
in
a
study
taken
in
several
cities,
one
of
which
was
philadelphia.
and
one
of
the
findings
that
dr.
caplovitz
made
was
a
demography
of
the
persons
that
he
had
studied
and
he
found
that
only
4%
of
these
persons
earned
over
$10,000.00
annually.
now,
i
think
initially
that
the
reason
that
this
finding
came
about
was
because
of
the
way
he
conducted
a
study
and
i
do
not
think
it
indicates
anything
differently
about
persons
under,
earning
$10,000.00.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
instituted
by
38
named
plaintiffs
on
behalf
of
a
class
of
all
persons
in
pennsylvania
who
would
sign
contracts
containing
confession-of-judgment
clauses.
i
will
refer
to
the
appellants
in
discussing
this
case
as
the
consumers
since
they
are
all
consumers
and
the
appellees
as
the
creditors.
i
would
also
like
permission
to
request
that
five
minutes
of
my
time
be
reserved
for
rebuttal.
the
pennsylvania
state
--
we
have
a
law
in
pennsylvania
that
permitted
and
in
fact,
did
in
the
case
of
these
38
named
consumers,
the
prothonotary
who
is
merely
a
court
clerk
to
ministerially
enter
judgments
against
the
consumers
without
their
having
had
any
notice
nor
opportunity
to
be
heard
prior
to
the
entry
of
that
judgment.
now,
the
reason
that,
the
only
thing
that
authorized
the
prothonotary
to
do
this
other
than
the
state
law
was
a
clause
which
was
contained
in
the
contracts
that
each
of
the
consumer
signed.
this
clause,
of
course
is
the
confession-of-judgment
clause
and
i
think
that
there
are
two
significant
characteristics
of
the
confession-of-judgment
clause.
first,
it
is
one
of
the
many
clauses
that
it
is
very
in
prime
fine
print
in
contract.
it
is
a
difficult
clause
to
understand,
many
attorneys
do
not
understand
what
the
effect
of
the
clause
is.
and
i
think
a
second
important
aspect,
is
that
confession-of-judgment
clauses
are
contained
in
almost
every
contract
in
pennsylvania
and
which
credits
is
extended
in
any
form.
that
is
to
say,
loan
contracts,
retail
installment
sale
contracts,
in
leases,
there
is
a
confession-of-judgment
and
ejectment,
and
of
course
also
in
mortgage
contracts.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
yes.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
yes,
there
is
your
honor.
there
are
80
exhibits.
actually,
there
are
81
exhibits,
80
of
the
exhibits
are
contracts,
so
that
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
yes,
they
are
the
contracts
that
each
of
the
main
plaintiffs
signed
in
the
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
your
honor,
there
was
no
appendix
in
this
case,
so
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
as
we
move
that
to
proceed
in
the
original
record.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
that
is
right
your
honor.
now,
the
confession-of-judgment
that
the
prothonotary
may
enter,
may
be
entered
immediately.
after
the
contract
is
signed,
that
is
it
can
be
entered
even
before
there
is
any
allegation
of
fault.
it
can
be
entered
the
same
day
that
the
contract
is
executed.
it
cannot
immediately
serve
as
the
basis
for
execution
and
sale
of
the
consumers’
property.
however,
all
that,
the
creditor
need
to
do
it
at
that
point
to
execute
and
sale
the
consumers
property
is
to
file
ex
parte
in
averment
that
the
consumer
has
defaulted.
now,
what
notice
does
the
consumer
get
to
the
proceedings
that
are
occurring
against
him?
well,
after
the
judgment
is
entered,
he
is
required
to
get
notice
of
the
entry
of
the
judgment.
however,
the
property
of
the
consumer
can
be
sold
as
short
as
20
days
after
the
notice
of
the
entry
of
judgment
is
given.
also,
if
there
is
a
sale
of
the
consumer’s
real
estate,
he
is
given
notice
that
the
writ
of
execution
has
been
issued
against
this
real
estate
and
also
he
is
given
notice
of
the
sale
of
his
property.
however,
this
is
generally
by
publication
although,
there
must
also
be
notice
by
mail
and
that
notice
by
mail
may
be
as
little
as
10
days
before
the
property
is
sold.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
i
think
if
it
would
be
noticed
that
the
consumer
would
have
an
opportunity
at
a
hearing
to
raise
any
defenses
that
he
might
have
before
execution
in
sale
could
proceed
on
the
confessed
judgment,
then
i
think
that
it
would
comport
with
due
process.
of
course,
that
is
not
what
is
assured
by
the
pennsylvania
confession-of-judgment
statutes
and
rules.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
that
is
right,
there
is
really
only
one
procedure
by
which
the
consumer
can
possibly
stop
the
sale
of
his
property
and
that
is
by
petitioning
to
open
or
to
strike
the
judgment.
now,
what
happens
when
someone
petitions
or
opens
to
strike
to
judgment?
mr.
david
a.
scholl
no,
he
does
not
receive
that
notice.
he
never
receives
any
notice
prior
to
the
entry
of
the
confessed
judgment.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
oh,
i
am
sorry.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
the
only
thing
that
he
can
do
is
to
petition
to
open
or
to
strike
the
judgment.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
the
point
is
that
in
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
he
never
gets
that
notice.
there
is
no
requirement
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
if
it
is
prior
to
the
entry
of
judgment,
he
would
be
able
to
go
in
the
court
and
attempt
to
enjoin
the
creditor
from
obtaining
the
judgment,
that
is
the
only
thing
i
can
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
the
problem
is
that
the
pennsylvania
procedures
do
not
provide
any
entry
or
any
notice
prior
to
the
entry
of
judgment.
and
in
fact,
i
know
of
no
instance
and
certainly
that
was
not
the
case
in
any
of
the
named
plaintiffs
cases
in
which
the
notice
of
the
judgment
was
to
be
entered
was
provided
to
the
consumer
prior
to
the
entry
of
judgment.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
that
would
be
a
different
case
and
i
think
perhaps,
in
that
case,
depending
on
what
the
notice
was
and
what
opportunity
the
consumer
would,
have
to
come
in
and
present
his
defenses,
what
you
are
suggesting
may
comport
with
due
process
of
law.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
the
problem
that
i
have
is
what
he
could
do
prior
to
the
entry
of
judgment.
i
think
that
what
mr.
justice
marshall
was
suggesting
was
that
person
would
obtain
notice
prior
to
the
entry
of
judgment
and
i
think
the
only
thing
that
could
possibly
be
done
is
bringing
some
kind
of
an
injunction
action
to
prevent
the
creditor
from
proceeding.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
that
is
correct.
he
can
do
it
and
the
prothonotary
would
enter
it
anyway.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
that
is
the
only
procedure
i
can
conceive
of.
the
prothonotary
has
no
digression,
he
must
enter
the
judgment.
the
state
statute
says
that
he
must
enter
the
judgment
as
long
as
he
is
presented
with
the
document
that
contains
a
confession-of-judgment
clause
in
it.
now,
as
i
had
mentioned,
there
is
of
course,
the
procedure
to
petition
to
open
or
to
strike
the
judgment.
however,
this
is
simply
a
procedure
that
is
provided
in
pennsylvania
as
in
most
jurisdictions
to
obtain
relief
from
any
judgment.
it
is
a
petition
that
is
directed
to
the
court’s
discretion
and
the
court,
it
must
be
shown,
the
consumer
must
come
forward
and
show
that
he
has
a
meritorious
defense
before
the
judgment
will
be
open
and
he
even
gets
an
opportunity
to
come
in
and
have
a
hearing
on
his
motion.
this
of
course,
would
deny
him
the
right
to
any
jury
trial
to
determine
whether
the
defense
that
he
is
claiming
is
a
meritorious
defense.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
yes,
then
there
is
a
hearing
on
the
merits,
if
the
judgment
is
open
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
then
you
could
obtain
a
jury
trial
after
the
judgment
is
open.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
yes,
he
could
have
a
jury
determination
after
the
judgment
is
open
but
the
problem
with
the
pennsylvania
procedure
is
that
he
must
come
forward
and
show
that
he
has
a
meritorious
defense
before
a
judge
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
he
presents
whatever
evidence
he
can,
usually,
he
has
to
proceed
by
depositions,
is
another
aspect
of
confession-of-judgment
is
that
the
burden
of
proof
switches
but
also
that
the
costs
are
increased,
where
the
consumer
must
come
forward
and
present
his
defenses
through
a
petition
to
open
a
strike
rather
than
proceeding
in
the
normal
proceeding,
answering
a
complaint.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
the
new
confession
rules
do
provide
that
he
can
take
testimony.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
i
suppose
he
could
try
it.
he
could
proceed
with
only
affidavits.
but
the
problem
is
of
course
that
he
would
not
have
a
jury
trial
at
that
stage,
which
determines
that
he
actually
has
a
meritorious
defense.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
that
is
right.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
now,
the
court
below
recognized
that
in
fact,
the
opening
in
striking
procedure
did
change
the
burden
of
proof
and
that
it
did
significantly
increase
the
costs
that
the
consumer
would
ordinarily
have
in
the
complaint
answer
proceeding.
and
the
court
below
further
declared
that
confession-of-judgment,
at
least
for
the
class
on
whose
behalf
it
held
that
the
action
could
be
maintained
did
violate
due
process
of
law.
essentially,
the
court
held
that
since
the
consumer
did
not
have
any
notice
nor
any
opportunity
to
be
heard
prior
to
the
entry
of
judgment
that
therefore,
he
was
denied
due
process
of
law.
however,
the
court
below
did
make
three
exceptions
from
the
ruling
that
the
consumers
urge
below.
the
more
the
consumers
urge
that
the
pennsylvania
confession
statutes
and
rules
be
declared
unconstitutional
on
their
face.
the
court
below
instead
declared
that,
yes,
it
is
unconstitutional
for
a
certain
group
of
people
but
it
is
not
unconstitutional
regarding
three
specific
classes
of
persons.
now,
the
first
class
which
should
accept
it
was
all
persons
wherein
$10,000.00
or
more
annually.
person
earning
more
than
$10,000.00
confessed
judgment
could
be
entered,
executed
and
serve
as
the
basis
for
sale
against
him.
secondly,
it
made
an
exception
for
all
persons
who
signed
mortgages
are
actually
signed
confession
clauses
as
their
signed
bonds
and
warrants
and
notes
that
contain
confession-of-judgment
clauses
which
are
company
mortgages
so
that
in
any
mortgage
transaction,
a
person
could
also
validly
sign
a
confession-of-judgment
that
it
would
serve
its
execution
and
sale
of
his
property.
and
the
third
exception
at
the
court
made,
the
court
said
that
well,
if
at
a
prior
hearing
and
well
it
did
not
set
down,
how
the
procedure
would
be
carried
out.
it
could
be
showed
that
the
consumer
voluntarily,
knowingly,
and
intelligently
waive
his
due
process
rights,
then
in
that
case
too,
the
confessed
judgment
could
be
entered
and
served
as
basis
for
execution
and
sale
of
the
consumers
property.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
which
forms
are
you
speaking
about?
mr.
david
a.
scholl
it
is
not
in
a
separate
printed
form,
what
it
is,
is
a,
usually,
it
is
one
clause
in
a
contract
that
contains
numerous
other
clauses,
as
i
think
probably
the
best
reference
point
for,
your
honor,
would
be
the
exhibits
in
this
case.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
oh!
mr.
david
a.
scholl
i
think
it
is
here
somewhere.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
yes,
well,
it
is
difficult
to
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well
it
is
use
in
practically
every
contract.
every
contract
in
pennsylvania
wherein
credit
is
extended
in
any
form,
most
every
contract,
retail
installment
sale
contracts,
bonds
and
warranted
mortgages,
somewhere
in
there.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
yes,
they
printed
form.
in
fact
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
they
are
standardized
forms.
in
fact,
some
of
the
exhibits
that
we
have
included
are
simply
forms
that
we
got
from
the
local
stationery
store,
and
they
all
contain
confession-of-judgment
clauses
in
the
body.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
no,
there
was
no
cross-appeal.
the
only
party
that
is
appealed
are
the
consumers.
we
are
appealing
that
from
the
decision
failing
to
declare
confession-of-judgment
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
there
has
been
no
cross-appeal.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
lennox
is
the
--
or
he
was,
he
is
recently
been,
or
i
guess
he
still
is
officially
the
sheriff
of
philadelphia
county.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
he
is
the
person
who
has
the
duty
of
executing
and
selling
the
property
of
the
consumers.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
lennox
took
no
cross-appeal,
that
is
correct.
now,
i
think
it
is
perhaps
well
to
focus
on
the
three
exceptions
that
the
court
made
and
how
easily
these
exceptions
might
be
used
as
a
device
of
circumvention
of
the
entire
fact
of
the
decision
below.
for
instance,
the
court
says
that
in
any
case,
where
there
is
a
mortgage
and
a
bond
and
warrant
and
note
accompanying
that
mortgage
that
if
the
consumers
signs
that,
well,
then
you
can
confess
judgment
against
it.
now,
the
court
does
not
restrict
however,
if
the
transaction
to
purchase
money
mortgage.
mortgage
can
in
fact,
be
taken
by
a
creditor
in
any
transaction.
it
can
be
taken
in
a
loan
transaction.
a
chattel
mortgage
could
be
taken
in
a
retail
or
installment
sale
transaction.
and
in
fact,
there
was
much
evidence
that
this
is
exactly
what
was
happening
in
philadelphia
county
prior
to
the
time
that
mr.
justice
brennan
issued
a
stay
order
which
stopped
all
executions
and
sales
on
confessed
judgments
in
philadelphia
county.
the
$10,000.00
and
over
exception
has
also
been
circumvented
by
simply
requiring
that
a
borrower
filed
an
affidavit,
at
the
time
that
he
take
out
a
loan
or
whatever
harbor
he
is
retaining
credit
that
he
earns
$10,000.00
and
over
a
year.
and
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
creditor
should
have
the
leverage
to
get
the
mortgage
or
to
get
the
affidavit
from
the
consumer.
because
of
course,
before
he
was
able
to
get
the
confession-of-judgment
clause,
why
not
just
ask
the
consumer
to
sign
one
more
paper
which
in
fact,
has
the
same
effect.
i
think
there
is
also
a
problem
with
the
other
exception
that
the
court
set
out,
the
voluntary
knowing
and
intelligent
waiver
hearing
which
is
to
be
held.
the
court
below
sets
no
procedure
on
how
this
is
to
take
place.
the
way
they
usually
were
scheduled
in
philadelphia
county
after
the
decision
was
by
petition
and
rule
to
show
cause
upon
the
consumer.
of
course,
the
consumer
gets
this
petition
that
says,
he
has
to
come
in
and
show
that
he
did
not
knowingly,
voluntarily,
intelligently
waive
his
rights.
this
does
not
apprise
him
of
actually
what
the
significance
of
that
hearing
is
going
to
be.
the
consumers
never
apprised
that
if
it
is
shown
in
fact,
that
he
knowingly,
voluntarily
and
intelligently
waived
his
rights
that
he
is
not
going
to
have
any
hearing
on
the
merits
of
any
defenses
that
he
might
have.
also,
the
court
below
focuses
in
its
discussion
although,
it
says
knowingly,
voluntarily
and
intelligently
on
an
understanding
waiver
by
the
creditor
at
the
time
that
the
contract
is
signed.
therefore,
we
have
the
anomalous
result
of
somebody
who
understands
the
confession-of-judgment
clause
and
perhaps
went
to
a
lawyer
and
asked
the
lawyer
to
explain
the
contract
that
he
is
signing
before
he
signed
it,
he
is
now
accepted
from
the
class.
because
he
knows
or
he
understood
what
confession-of-judgment
was
at
the
time
that
he
signed
it.
the
person
who
does
not
know
what
it
is
or
perhaps
is
not
prudent
enough
to
go
to
a
lawyer,
he
does
not
understandingly
waive
his
rights
therefore
he
is
protected
by
the
court’s
decision.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
excuse
me?
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
i
think
that
there
is
a
practical
problem
if
somebody
showing
that
somebody
actually
voluntarily,
knowingly,
and
intelligently
waives
his
rights.
it
is
like,
i
will
discuss
it.
i
do
not
think
it
is
possible
but
i
think
one
of
the
problems
is
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
no,
what
i
am
focusing
on
your
honor
is
the
notice
that
the
consumer
gets.
all
the
consumer
gets
is
notice
that
he
is
going
to
have
a
hearing
and
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
if
it
can
be
posited
that
a
person
knew
exactly
what
the
significance
of
that
hearing
was
going
to
be,
that
would
mean,
he
would
not
be
able
to
raise
any
defenses
that
he
might
have,
or
perhaps
this
exception
might
make
some
sense
but
the
court,
as
i
said
in
the
opinion,
when
they
discussed
the
waiver
hearing
speak
only
of
understanding
whether
the
person
understood
what
the
clause
meant
at
that
time
and
i
think
that
if
we
look
closer
at
the
court’s
analysis
of
waiver,
we
see
that
the
court
did
not
really
focus
on
the
elements
of
voluntary,
knowing,
and
intelligent
in
its
discussion.
the
court
below
says,
it
a
matter
of
fact,
--
and
i
think
this
is
where
the
court
begins
to
err
in
its
analysis
and
i
think
this
is
what
led
it
to
the
exceptions.
it
says
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
yes
i
do
your
honor.
i
do
object
that
assertion
and
the
reason
that
i
object
to
that
assertion
is
that,
in
a
confession-of-judgment
clause,
what
is
in
fact,
being
waived
is
due
process
itself.
what
somebody
is
waiving
is
any
notice
or
opportunity
to
be
heard
prior
to
the
judgment.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
although,
i
think
that
it
is
well
to
focus
on
the
elements
of
voluntary
and
intelligence
to
see
whether
in
fact,
there
could
be
a
voluntary
and
intelligent
waiver
also,
it
is
also
our
position
that
even
if
you
could
show
that
there
was
a
voluntary
and
knowing
and
intelligent
waiver
that
nevertheless
such
a
waiver
simply
should
not
be
acceptable
to
this
court.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
thank
you.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
what
we
want
to
do
is
prevent
the
burden
of
proof
from
being
shifted
ordinarily
in
an
adversary
proceeding
when
one
person
comes
forward
and
attempts
to
get
the
property
of
another
person,
he
has
the
burden
of
showing
to
the
court
by
a
clear
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
he
is
entitled
to
the
other
person’s
property.
the
pennsylvania
due
process
or
confession-of-judgment
procedure
shifts
that
burden
of
proof.
the
creditor
gets
the
confessed
judgment
right
in
the
beginning
and
the
consumer
will
spend
all
his
time
trying
to
somehow
get
rid
of
that
judgment
that
he
has
against
them.
it
switches
around
the
entire
adversary
proceeding
and
the
only
way
that
he
can
do
this
is
by
coming
in
and
showing
to
the
court
in
a
petition
to
open
or
strike
that
in
fact,
he
by
a
clear
preponderance,
the
evidence
has
a
meritorious
defense.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
i
think
that
is
a
very
difficult
question
your
honor
and
i
think
it
is
so
difficult
that
the
consumers
do
not
want
to
urge
for
anything
that
is
unreasonable.
i
do
not
think,
for
instance,
that
we
would
urge
that
any
judgments
that
have
been
entered
by
expunge
or
we
would
not
urge
that,
in
any
case.
i
think
that
what
we
would
urge
is
that
there
be,
that
there
be
no
more
execution
in
sales
on
even
the
judgments
that
have
been
entered
in
the
past.
that
in
the
future,
there
be
no
more
entrance
of
judgment.
now,
the
land
title
association
brief
of
course
raises
the
issue
of
retroactivity
and
i
would
like
to
comment
on
what
they
say
and
i
think
that
we
actually
concur
with
the
land
title
association’s
position
which
is
that
any
decision
on
entry
should
not
in
any
sense
be
retroactive
and
that
regarding
executions
in
sales
that
a
decision
on
that
be
retroactive
only
since
january
26,
1970.
the
reason
that
i
choose
that
date,
it
is
a
date
that
the
land
title
associations
indicate
that
they
advise
all
of
their
members
that
they
should
be
careful
in
the
future
about
insuring
titles
on
confessed
judgment.
and
i
think
that
was
a
point
at
which
the
hardship
factor
that
may
weigh
against
a
fully
retroactive
decision,
sort
of
changes
over
and
that
it
is
not
at
that
point
so
important
because
at
that
point
the
land
title
associations
were
unnoticed.
that
in
fact,
confession-of-judgment
probably
or
possibly
was
constitutionally
deficient.
i
would
just
like
to
say
a
few
words
about
whether
the
waiver
can
ever
be
a
voluntary
in
the
confession-of-judgment
situation.
i
think
that
perhaps
the
case
before
this
has
highlighted
several
of
actually,
the
distinctions
here.
what
we
are
concerned
with
in
this
case
is
a
clause
that
is
contained
in
almost
every
contract
in
pennsylvania
and
the
parties
that
are
negotiating
here
are
not
two
corporations,
they
are
in
fact,
the
consumer
who
probably
would
not
even
know
what
confession-of-judgment
was.
much
less
would
be
effective
it
is
in
a
company
which
uses
a
standard
form
and
understands
of
course,
perfectly
what
confession-of-judgment
means.
or
the
consumer
in
fact,
is
put
in
a
position
where
either
has
to
sign
the
contract
that
contains
the
confession-of-judgment
clause
or
he
has
to
do
without
credit.
he
is
put
in
the
situation
almost
the
classic,
adhesion
contract
situation,
and
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
there
is
not
a
voluntary
waiver
of
the
due
process
rights
for
the
consumers.
it
may
be
valid.
there
may
be
a
voluntary
waiver
for
some
corporations
although
in
pennsylvania
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
i
think
that
we
are
because
there
is
certainly
nothing
in
the
statute
that
distinguishes
persons
who
voluntarily
waive
their
rights
or
corporations
from
individuals.
i
think
that
the
statute
as
it
is
drawn
affects
all
persons
and
i
think
that
the
court,
the
lower
court
could
only
have
come
to
the
conclusion,
well,
it
is
alright
for
corporation
but
it
is
not
alright
for
individuals
if
it
could
have
found
that
the
statute
was
in
fact
severable
and
if
the
legislature
would
have
intended
to
retain
a
statute
that
said
well,
a
confession-of-judgment
is
alright
for
corporations
but
it
is
not
alright
for
consumers.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
no.
in
fact,
we
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
it
just
applies
to
individual.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
i
think
the
basis
was
that
we
did
not
present
to
the
court
any
consumers
that
earned
over
$10,000.00
and
they
felt
that
we
had
failed
to
meet
our
burden
of
proof
on
that
issue.
they
also
had
suggested
another
argument,
they
say
that
well
maybe
these
poor
people
could
not
adequately
represent
the
people
that
earn
over
$10,000.00
because
those
people
might
want
to
retain
confession
of
judgment
because
now
the
confession
is
gone,
it
might
be
harder
to
get
credit.
well,
i
think
that
there
is
a
problem
with
that
reasoning
and
the
problem
is
that
the
person
that
is
earning
over
$10,000.00
as
an
income
which
is
security
prohibited.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
that
is
true
too.
there
is
no
determination
made
as
to
whether
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
that
is
right.
i
think
where
the
court
erred
in
that
discussion
is
assuming
that
we
had
to
show
for
every
group
of
income
people
that
in
fact,
they
were
in
the
same
boat,
so
to
speak
as
to
the
loan.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
they
made
no
decision
on
the
statute
on
its
face.
the
statutes
still
retained
but
the
court
said
it
is
just
as
applied
to
this
group
of
people
who
earn
under
$10,000.00
and
none
more
be
jurors.
that
group
of
people
is
now
going
to
be
protected
from
confessed
judgments
being
entered
and
executed
and
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
our
quarrel
is
that,
we
do
not
feel
that
there
is
any
distinction
between
persons
that
earn
over
$10,000
and
those
that
are
not.
in
fact,
had
the
court
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
one
of
the
named
plaintiffs,
i
think
does
earn
over
$10,000.00
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
no,
i
believe
there
is
one
person
that
is
appealing
that
earns
over
$10,000,00
but
i
will
concede
that
perhaps,
that
is
another
case
but
i
do
not
think
that
what
the
court
should
do
is
built
in,
in
its
decisions
other
cases.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
yes.
a
person
can
still
be
extracted
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
that
is
right,
as
the
hearing
would
not
even
come
up
unless
the
person
earns
under
$10,000.00.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
that
is
right.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
that
is
right.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
right.
that
hearing
takes
place
and
--
mr.
david
a.
scholl
well,
the
court
does
not
say
that,
how
that
hearing
used
to
take
place;
the
way
it
has
been
taking
place
is
by
petition
and
rule
in
philadelphia
county
which
i
do
not
think
is
an
adequate
substitute.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
he
has
to
do
something
to
have
that
hearing.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
that
is
right.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
no,
in
fact,
in
answer
to
mr.
justice’s
white
particularly
on
that
point,
we
would
urge
that
in
fact,
what
is
in
question
here
is
a
waiver
of
the
entirety
of
due
process.
it
is
a
waiver
of
any
notice
and
opportunity
to
be
heard
prior
to
the
entry
of
judgment
and
prior
to
something
which
can
lead
to
the
taking
away
of
a
person’s
property
on
that
such
a
waiver
is
simply
invalid
on
its
face
because
it
is
a
waiver
of
due
process
and
that
is
something
that
this
court
simply
cannot
permit
to
take
place
under
our
form
of
government.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
that
is
right.
mr.
david
a.
scholl
it
seems
that
where
they
got
it
was
from
one
piece
of
evidence
that
we
introduced
a
study
taken
by
dr.
david
caplovitz
of
the
columbia
university
bureau
of
applied
social
research
in
new
york.
david
caplovitz
had
studied
the
attitudes
of
persons
who
he
termed
default
debtors,
in
a
study
taken
in
several
cities,
one
of
which
was
philadelphia.
and
one
of
the
findings
that
dr.
caplovitz
made
was
a
demography
of
the
persons
that
he
had
studied
and
he
found
that
only
4%
of
these
persons
earned
over
$10,000.00
annually.
now,
i
think
initially
that
the
reason
that
this
finding
came
about
was
because
of
the
way
he
conducted
a
study
and
i
do
not
think
it
indicates
anything
differently
about
persons
under,
earning
$10,000.00.
