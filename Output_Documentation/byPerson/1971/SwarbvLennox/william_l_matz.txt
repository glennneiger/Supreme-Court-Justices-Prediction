mr.
william
l.
matz
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
here
on
behalf
of
the
pennsylvania
savings
and
loan
league
which
is
an
organization
of
savings
and
loans
in
pennsylvania
all
of
which
are
mutual
trust
institutions.
they
lend
their
money
for
the
purpose
of
purchasing
homes
by
their
members
and
they
appear
in
a
different
guise
as
amicus
curiae
below
for
the
insured
savings
and
loan
group
of
the
philadelphia
area
and
in
that
position,
we
presented
the
position
of
the
mortgagee.
and
we
are
appearing
here
again
to
present
the
position
of
the
mortgagee,
the
person
who
takes
a
bonded
mortgage
to
secure
a
loan
for
the
purchase
of
real
estate.
mr.
william
l.
matz
i
hope
to
sir,
yes.
mr.
william
l.
matz
they
did
sir,
it
is
in
the
opinion.
mr.
william
l.
matz
no,
i
intend
to
go
further
sir.
i
hope.
first,
i
should
like
to
make
it
clear
that
the
matter
before
this
court
is
an
interpretation
of
the
rules
of
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
promulgated
on
the
provisions
in
the
constitution
and
that
is
the
issue
here,
not
in
the
statute.
the
court
below
exempted
bonds
and
mortgages
in
real
estate
transactions
and
i
think
for
the
following
reasons.
first
and
foremost,
the
plaintiff
offered
no
evidence
whatsoever
dealing
with
bonds
and
mortgages.
there
was
not
one
bit
of
evidence
in
the
record
by
the
plaintiff
or
by
anyone
which
indicated
that
in
any
way
bonds
and
mortgages
were
in
the
same
category
as
the
defendants
they
had
named
in
the
action
which
were
a
group
of
finance
companies.
now,
if
your
honor
will
read
the
complaint,
you
will
find
that
the
entire
direction
of
the
complaint
is
to
the
conduct
of
certain
finance
companies.
mr.
william
l.
matz
the
court
below
made
that
distinction,
that
there
was
no
evidence
and
the
court
said
in
determining
the
class
to
be
covered
by
this
action,
only
those
persons
against
whom
there
were
evidence
should
be
included
in
the
class
unless
there
were
some
good
reason
for
including
them
which
was
not
given
and
this
court
said,
the
plaintiff
had
given
no
evidence
with
reference
to
this
and
indicated
that
no
reason
why
the
mortgage
bond
class
should
be
included
in
the
class.
now,
in
my
--
mr.
william
l.
matz
sorry?
mr.
william
l.
matz
no
sir.
mr.
william
l.
matz
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
william
l.
matz
that
is
correct
sir.
that
is
correct.
i
should
like
to
point
out
--
the
difference
between
a
mortgage
bond
transaction
and
a
financing
transaction
for
a
small
loan
company,
for
one,
the
mortgage
bond
transaction
arises
out
of
the
purchase
of
a
home.
secondly,
it
has
been
established
below
that
in
almost
every
case
where
a
home
was
purchase,
the
purchaser
was
represented
by
either
an
attorney
or
by
a
license
realtor,
so,
the
purchaser
did
have
representation
at
the
time
of
closing.
thirdly,
at
the
time
of
closing
the
purchaser
receives
a
statement
on
the
regulations,
under
the
truth
in
lending
act,
which
clearly
indicates
to
the
purchaser
at
that
time
that
he
is
executed
a
document
which
has
within
it
a
confession
of
judgment.
fourthly,
the
mortgage,
the
lending
institutions
that
we
represent
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
sale
of
real
estate
or
any
other
product,
they
only
have
one
purpose
to
lend
money
for
the
purchase
of
homes
and
therefore,
they
are
not
involved
in
questions
of
breach
of
warranty
or
anything
like
that.
they
only
lend
money
to
members
of
the
association
for
the
purpose
of
buying
a
home.
now,
with
reference
to
the
actual
foreclosure
procedures,
which
i
think
was
talked
about
before,
when
a
foreclosure
proceeding
is
begun
on
real
estate,
the
bond
is
entered
a
record
that
is
not
really
a
new
lien,
because
that
bond
is
part
of
the
same
transaction
for
which
a
mortgage
was
executed
and
which
is
already
a
lien
on
the
property
and
has
been
a
lien
on
the
property
from
the
moment
the
loan
was
made.
so,
that
the
entry
of
a
bond
creates
no
new
obligation
by
the
borrower
it
is
merely
a
different
procedure
for
executing
against
the
real
estate
there
are
no
two
obligations,
there
is
only
one
and
it
is
the
same
obligation
whether
it
is
a
bond
or
the
mortgage
payment
of
one
discharge
or
the
other.
when
the
sheriff
--
mr.
william
l.
matz
the
bond
provision?
mr.
william
l.
matz
we
could
foreclose
on
the
mortgage
but
that
would
be
a
wrong
proceeding,
you
would
have
several
defects
sir.
for
one
thing
it
is
more
expensive.
for
another
thing
it
takes
much
longer
to
do.
thirdly,
in
today’s
market
with
real
estate
dropping
a
hiatus
of
several
months
in
foreclosure
can
be
very
serious
in
the
position
of
the
lender.
and
as
i
pointed
out
this
is
purely
a
procedural
question,
whether
we
proceed
on
the
bond
or
we
proceed
on
the
mortgage.
we
think
it
is
better
for
the
lender
to
proceed
on
the
bond.
we
think
it
is
better
for
the
borrower
too
because
if
we
have
a
market
where
we
can
realize
on
our
security
more
quickly,
we
could
lend
a
larger
margin
under
this
lower
interest
rate.
now,
we
pointed
out
below,
that
the
philadelphia
area
has
the
lowest
mortgage
interest
rate
in
the
united
states
and
i
am
not
saying
here
that
this
is
the
only
reason
but
i
am
certainly
saying
this
is
one
of
the
reasons.
mr.
william
l.
matz
all
foreclosures
are
done
outside
the
court
your
honor
whether
it
is
in
a
bond
or
on
the
mortgage.
mr.
william
l.
matz
that
is
correct.
and
do
not
have
to
appear
in
court
unless
an
answer
was
actually
was
filed,
right?
mr.
william
l.
matz
now,
i
wanted
to
point
out
that
on
a
petition
to
open
judgments,
our
experience
has
been
that
the
court
invariably
grants
that
petition,
one
of
this
file,
for
even
the
most
flimsy
of
reasons
and
that
petition
carries
with
it
a
stay
of
proceedings,
so,
that
if
a
defendant
who
has
at
least
20
days
--
mr.
william
l.
matz
i
have
never
seen
one
that
did
not
carry
it
sir.
i
do
not
think
that
the
right,
the
rules
state
specifically
but,
i
have
never
in
my
practice
seen
a
petition
to
open
judgment
allowed
without
the
stay
of
proceedings,
and
i
have
never
seen
one
refused.
mr.
william
l.
matz
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
william
l.
matz
the
opening
is
not
automatic
sir.
mr.
william
l.
matz
no,
but
the
burden
of
proof
on
that
is
exactly
the
same
as
if
it
would
have
not
been
in
complaint
in
assumpsit,
there
is
no
difference,
exactly
the
same.
the
defendant
on
an
execution
on
a
real
estate
gets
at
least
20
days
notice
of
the
sale
and
usually
considerably
more.
the
minimum
time
he
receives
is
20
days
which
is
exactly
the
same
time
that
a
defendant
in
a
suit
on
a
complaint
has
to
file
on
that
sir.
he
has
exactly
the
same
time,
20
days
in
which
to
do
something.
if
he
does
not
do
it
in
the
20
or
more
days
he
has
available,
there
may
be
a
sale.
during
the
period
from
the
date
of
execution
to
the
date
of
sale
there
is
no
interference
with
the
debtor’s
right
of
possession
or
the
use
of
the
property.
he
remains
a
possession,
uses
it
as
he
did
before
with
no
interference
in
any
way
in
his
rights.
mr.
william
l.
matz
that
may
or
may
not
be
sir.
it
depends
on
the
circumstances,
if
the
sheriff
merely
makes
a
levy
it
is
the
same.
if
the
sheriff
is
directed
to
take
the
personally,
under
custody
it
may
be
different.
this
would
depend
on
a
particular
levy
in
that
particular
case.
in
real
estate
it
is
certainly
so.
now,
i
pointed
out
before
that
the
matter
before
this
court
was
a
construction
of
the
rules
of
our
supreme
court
and
i
should
like
to
point
out
that
at
no
time
has
our
supreme
court
been
asked
to
rule
on
the
validity
of
the
same
rules
which
it
has
promoted
and
it
might
be
advisable
to
refer
this
back
and
therefore
for
our
courts
to
rule
on
these
matters
which
have
been
presently
never
been
ruled
upon.
i
think,
i
have
tried
to
point
out
why
the
mortgage
situation
differs
in
large
measure
from
the
finance
company
situation
and
from
the
other
situation
under
these
matters
which
i
think
induce
the
court
below
to
making
the
exception
of
the
situations
where
a
savings,
a
loan
or
other
lending
institution
lends
money
for
the
purchase
of
a
home
or
for
improvements
to
a
home
and
we
think
this
is
an
entirely
different
type
of
case
from
that
one
where
lending
is
made
for
other
purposes.
thank
you.
mr.
william
l.
matz
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
here
on
behalf
of
the
pennsylvania
savings
and
loan
league
which
is
an
organization
of
savings
and
loans
in
pennsylvania
all
of
which
are
mutual
trust
institutions.
they
lend
their
money
for
the
purpose
of
purchasing
homes
by
their
members
and
they
appear
in
a
different
guise
as
amicus
curiae
below
for
the
insured
savings
and
loan
group
of
the
philadelphia
area
and
in
that
position,
we
presented
the
position
of
the
mortgagee.
and
we
are
appearing
here
again
to
present
the
position
of
the
mortgagee,
the
person
who
takes
a
bonded
mortgage
to
secure
a
loan
for
the
purchase
of
real
estate.
mr.
william
l.
matz
i
hope
to
sir,
yes.
mr.
william
l.
matz
they
did
sir,
it
is
in
the
opinion.
mr.
william
l.
matz
no,
i
intend
to
go
further
sir.
i
hope.
first,
i
should
like
to
make
it
clear
that
the
matter
before
this
court
is
an
interpretation
of
the
rules
of
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
promulgated
on
the
provisions
in
the
constitution
and
that
is
the
issue
here,
not
in
the
statute.
the
court
below
exempted
bonds
and
mortgages
in
real
estate
transactions
and
i
think
for
the
following
reasons.
first
and
foremost,
the
plaintiff
offered
no
evidence
whatsoever
dealing
with
bonds
and
mortgages.
there
was
not
one
bit
of
evidence
in
the
record
by
the
plaintiff
or
by
anyone
which
indicated
that
in
any
way
bonds
and
mortgages
were
in
the
same
category
as
the
defendants
they
had
named
in
the
action
which
were
a
group
of
finance
companies.
now,
if
your
honor
will
read
the
complaint,
you
will
find
that
the
entire
direction
of
the
complaint
is
to
the
conduct
of
certain
finance
companies.
mr.
william
l.
matz
the
court
below
made
that
distinction,
that
there
was
no
evidence
and
the
court
said
in
determining
the
class
to
be
covered
by
this
action,
only
those
persons
against
whom
there
were
evidence
should
be
included
in
the
class
unless
there
were
some
good
reason
for
including
them
which
was
not
given
and
this
court
said,
the
plaintiff
had
given
no
evidence
with
reference
to
this
and
indicated
that
no
reason
why
the
mortgage
bond
class
should
be
included
in
the
class.
now,
in
my
--
mr.
william
l.
matz
sorry?
mr.
william
l.
matz
no
sir.
mr.
william
l.
matz
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
william
l.
matz
that
is
correct
sir.
that
is
correct.
i
should
like
to
point
out
--
the
difference
between
a
mortgage
bond
transaction
and
a
financing
transaction
for
a
small
loan
company,
for
one,
the
mortgage
bond
transaction
arises
out
of
the
purchase
of
a
home.
secondly,
it
has
been
established
below
that
in
almost
every
case
where
a
home
was
purchase,
the
purchaser
was
represented
by
either
an
attorney
or
by
a
license
realtor,
so,
the
purchaser
did
have
representation
at
the
time
of
closing.
thirdly,
at
the
time
of
closing
the
purchaser
receives
a
statement
on
the
regulations,
under
the
truth
in
lending
act,
which
clearly
indicates
to
the
purchaser
at
that
time
that
he
is
executed
a
document
which
has
within
it
a
confession
of
judgment.
fourthly,
the
mortgage,
the
lending
institutions
that
we
represent
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
sale
of
real
estate
or
any
other
product,
they
only
have
one
purpose
to
lend
money
for
the
purchase
of
homes
and
therefore,
they
are
not
involved
in
questions
of
breach
of
warranty
or
anything
like
that.
they
only
lend
money
to
members
of
the
association
for
the
purpose
of
buying
a
home.
now,
with
reference
to
the
actual
foreclosure
procedures,
which
i
think
was
talked
about
before,
when
a
foreclosure
proceeding
is
begun
on
real
estate,
the
bond
is
entered
a
record
that
is
not
really
a
new
lien,
because
that
bond
is
part
of
the
same
transaction
for
which
a
mortgage
was
executed
and
which
is
already
a
lien
on
the
property
and
has
been
a
lien
on
the
property
from
the
moment
the
loan
was
made.
so,
that
the
entry
of
a
bond
creates
no
new
obligation
by
the
borrower
it
is
merely
a
different
procedure
for
executing
against
the
real
estate
there
are
no
two
obligations,
there
is
only
one
and
it
is
the
same
obligation
whether
it
is
a
bond
or
the
mortgage
payment
of
one
discharge
or
the
other.
when
the
sheriff
--
mr.
william
l.
matz
the
bond
provision?
mr.
william
l.
matz
we
could
foreclose
on
the
mortgage
but
that
would
be
a
wrong
proceeding,
you
would
have
several
defects

for
one
thing
it
is

expensive.
for
another

it
takes
much

to
do.
thirdly,
in
today’s
market
with
real

dropping
a
hiatus
of
several
months
in

be
very
serious
in
the

of

and
as
i
pointed
out
this
is
purely
a
procedural

whether
we
proceed
on
the
bond
or
we
proceed
on
the
mortgage.
we
think
it
is
better
for
the
lender
to
proceed
on
the
bond.
we
think
it
is
better
for
the
borrower
too
because
if

a
market
where
we
can
realize
on
our
security
more

we
could
lend
a
larger
margin
under
this
lower

now,
we
pointed
out
below,
that
the
philadelphia
area
has
the
lowest
mortgage
interest
rate
in
the
united
states
and
i
am
not

here
that
this
is
the
only
reason
but
i

and
do
not

to

mr.

i
have
never

one
that
did
not

i
do
not
think
that
the

specifically
but,
i
have
never
in
my
practice
seen
a

to

allowed
without
the

and
i
have
never
seen
one
refused.
mr.
william

that
is
correct

mr.
william

matz
the

is
not

mr.

no,

the
burden
of
proof
on
that
is
exactly
the
same
as
if
it
would
have
not
been
in
complaint
in
assumpsit,
there
is
no
difference,
exactly
the
same.
the
defendant
on
an
execution
on
a
real
estate
gets
at
least
20
days
notice
of
the
sale
and
usually
considerably
more.
the
minimum
time
he
receives
is
20
days
which
is
exactly
the
same
time
that
a
defendant
in
a
suit
on
a
complaint
has
to
file
on
that
sir.
he
has
exactly
the
same
time,
20
days
in
which
to
do
something.
if
he
does
not
do
it
in
the
20
or
more
days
he
has
available,
there
may
be
a
sale.
during
the
period
from
the
date
of
execution
to
the
date
of
sale
there
is
no
interference
with
the
debtor’s
right
of
possession
or
the
use
of
the
property.
he
remains
a
possession,
uses
it
as
he
did
before
with
no
interference
in
any
way
in
his
rights.

that
may
or
may
not
be
sir.
it
depends
on
the
circumstances,
if
the
sheriff
merely
makes
a
levy
it
is
the
same.
if
the
sheriff
is
directed
to
take
the
personally,
under
custody
it
may
be
different.
this
would
depend
on
a
particular
levy
in
that
particular
case.
in
real
estate
it
is
certainly
so.
now,
i
pointed
out
before
that
the
matter
before
this
court
was
a
construction
of
the
rules
of
our
supreme
court
and
i
should
like
to
point
out
that
at
no
time
has
our
supreme
court
been
asked
to
rule
on
the
validity
of
the
same
rules
which
it
has
promoted
and
it
might
be
advisable
to
refer
this
back
and
therefore
for
our
courts
to
rule
on
these
matters
which
have
been
presently
never
been
ruled
upon.
i
think,
i
have
tried
to
point
out
why
the
mortgage
situation
differs
in
large
measure
from
the
finance
company
situation
and
from
the
other
situation
under
these
matters
which
i
think
induce
the
court
below
to
making
the
exception
of
the
situations
where
a
savings,
a
loan
or
other
lending
institution
lends
money
for
the
purchase
of
a
home
or
for
improvements
to
a
home
and
we
think
this
is
an
entirely
different
type
of
case
from
that
one
where
lending
is
made
for
other
purposes.
thank
you.
