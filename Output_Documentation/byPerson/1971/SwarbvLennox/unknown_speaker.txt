unknown
speaker
well,
you
have
in
footnote
1
on
page
12
of
your
brief,
what
you
say
is
a
typical
wording
of
such
a
clause?
unknown
speaker
is
there
anywhere
in
the
appendix
or
elsewhere
where
we
could
see
how
it
looks
in
print,
if
you
just
referred
it
to
fine
print?
unknown
speaker
in
the
initial
records?
unknown
speaker
they
are
here
in
the
appendix
that
would
show
as
that?
unknown
speaker
we
just
have
the
original
one?
unknown
speaker
alright,
thank
you.
but
this,
the
wording
is
how
a
typical
one
appears,
do
i
it
right
on
footnote
1
on
page
12
of
your
brief?
unknown
speaker
but
what
he
is
saying
is
he
could
not
afford
common
pleas
court
on
monday
and
say
now,
i
want
to
tender
evidence
and
defenses
of
this
proposed
action.
i
want
to
tender
evidence
of
breach
of
warranty.
you
are
telling
us
he
could
not
be
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
he
would
have
to
start
to
saying,
in
your
view
some
original
action
to
get
an
injunction
against
there
being
any
proceeding
of
the
judgment
notices,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
well
suppose
that
the
judgment
is
open?
what
then
happens
is
there
any
further
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
but
what
is
the
hearing
on
the
merits?
is
that
involved
with
jury
trial?
unknown
speaker
and
going
back
to
the
hypothetical,
i
suggest.
at
that
point
would
he
have
a
jury
determination
on
his
defense
of
breach
of
warranty?
unknown
speaker
how
does
he
show
that?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
merely
by
affidavit,
he
has
to
take
that
position,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
but
supposing
he
wanted
to
rely
only
on
affidavits
only?
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand
you,
all
that
he
gets
is
that
whether
his
affidavit
of
deposition
was
that
the
judgment
is
open
for
the
purposes
of
the
hearing?
unknown
speaker
and
that
maybe
a
hearing
at
which,
there
may
be
a
jury
trial.
unknown
speaker
alright!
unknown
speaker
now
incidentally,
in
this
instance,
you
do
not
have
the
forms
before
it,
but
are
these
all
of
the
printed
forms?
unknown
speaker
the
one
that
has
the
clause
at
the
bottom
of
page
12,
the
confession-of-judgment
clause.
are
they
in
a
printed
form
that
is
what
i
am
trying
to
get
at
or
what
are
they?
unknown
speaker
we
do
not
have
that
is
why
i
am
asking
you.
they
are
in
original
record
but
we
do
not
have
it
here.
unknown
speaker
we
have
the
original
record
here.
unknown
speaker
they
are
not
here
on
the
bench.
i
cannot
see
them
before
me,
that
is
why
i
am
asking
the
questions.
unknown
speaker
what
it
takes
to
spend
--
some
form
of
a
contract
in
appliance
that
he
uses,
for
example
is
something
like
that?
unknown
speaker
are
they
printed
form?
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
i
am
trying
to
find
out.
unknown
speaker
who
is
lennox?
is
he
a
state
officer?
unknown
speaker
sheriff
of
philadelphia.
unknown
speaker
and
lennox
took
no
cross-appeal?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
what
he
is
doing
right
here,
right?
unknown
speaker
what
is
unconstitutional
about
someone
who
knows
what
he
is
doing,
waiving
his
right?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
no
one
could
understand
that?
unknown
speaker
let
us
assume,
we
got
the
kind
of
a
notice
that
you
wanted
and
understood
exactly
what
kind
of
a
hearing
was
going
to
be
held,
namely
that
they
are
going
to
go
into
the
voluntariness,
intelligence
of
his
waiver
and
that
if
he
waives
why
he
is
going
to
have
his
judgment
against
himself.
let
us
assume
he
got
all
of
the
notice
he
wants.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
do
not
claim
there
and
as
i
understand
that
a
voluntary,
knowing,
intelligent
waiver
is
un-acceptable
constitutionally
to
dispense
with
notice
of
hearing
before
a
judgment.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say
that
nobody
should
be
committed
constitutionally
to
waive
notice
of
the
entry
of
judgment.
unknown
speaker
alright.
unknown
speaker
then,
i
just
wanted
this.
unknown
speaker
mr.
scholl,
if
you
prevail
here,
do
you
raise
any
question
as
to
the
validity
of
closed
and
past
transactions
in
pennsylvania.
in
other
words,
i
would
like
a
comment
from
you
on
the
retrospectivity
feature,
if
you
should
prevail?
unknown
speaker
you
are
suggesting
that
the
statute
might
be
alright
as
between
corporations
and
understanding
people?
but
not
with
respect
with
consumer?
unknown
speaker
in
fact,
it
really
is
not,
you
are
suggesting
that
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
well,
does
the
judgment
below
apply
to
the
corporation
under
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
only
the
individuals,
do
you
say?
unknown
speaker
earning
under
that
--
the
court
suggests
--
what
was
the
basis
of
the
$10,000.00?
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
suggestion
that
anyone
who
earns
$10,000.00
or
under
has
necessary
purpose.
unknown
speaker
it
is
just
that
the
only
proofs
you
had
for
the
people
you
are
representing
were
people
who
earned
not
more
than
$10,000.00,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
but
under
the
judgment
below,
what
is
the
standing
of
the
pennsylvania
statute
on
its
face?
unknown
speaker
then
what
is
your
quarrel?
what
it
is?
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
represent
anybody
that
makes
more
than
$10,000?
unknown
speaker
that
may
be
another
case.
you
do
not
represent
--
nobody
here
in
that
category,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
that
answers
to
justice
brennan?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
any
event,
i
gather
that
anyone
earning
under
$10,000.00
is
subject
to
this
waiver
in
face
of
this?
unknown
speaker
so
none
of
the
people
you
represent
has
any
protection
unless,
he
can
leave
that
hurdle,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
but
as
i
get
it.
the
person
earning
under
$10,000.00
has
no
protection.
if
in
fact,
it
is
establish
that
he
waive
these?
unknown
speaker
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
that
your
understanding
and
intelligent,
voluntarily
or
--
unknown
speaker
before
whom
does
the
hearing
take
place?
unknown
speaker
but
if
the
creditor
who
wants
his
judgment
as
the
person
who
earns
under
less
than
$10,000.00
is
the
one
who
has
to
initiate?
initiate
it.
unknown
speaker
before
he
can
go
forward
on
his
judgment.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that
satisfied
you
from
your
previous
argument?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
no
matter
how
intelligent
and
voluntary,
but
not
it
is?
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
cross-appeal
here,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
in
the
court
below
as
i
understand
it,
that
held
that
there
has
not
been
a
legal
waiver
on
the
part
of
any
of
these
people.
unknown
speaker
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
so,
where
is
your
case
of
controversy
here?
unknown
speaker
but
there
is
nobody
here
over
$10,000.00
and
there
is
no
cross
appeal?
unknown
speaker
that
does
not
make
it
necessarily
a
case
of
controversy.
unknown
speaker
including
that
the
court
was
wrong
on
people
under
$10,000.00?
unknown
speaker
may
i,
i
just
do
not
understand
this.
if
you
were
to
prevail
people
over
$10,000.00,
that
is
you
are
having
been
brought
here
by
the
other
side
who
prevailed
as
the
people
who
get
earning
under
$10,000.00,
are
you
suggesting
that
what
we
have
to
do
is
reverse
this
judgment,
if
they
won
below
even
if
they
are
the
appellants?
and
you
did
not
cross-appeal?
unknown
speaker
the
appellees
bring
it
up.
unknown
speaker
but
by
not
taking
a
cross-appeal,
does
it
not
follow
that
you
are
not
quarreling
with
that
part
of
the,
with
the
three-judge
court's
decision
that
held
this
pennsylvania
procedure,
constitutionally
invalid?
unknown
speaker
that
people
under
$10,000.00
except,
except
when
secured
by
mortgages
or
except
when
it
could
be
shown
that
they
did
this
knowingly
and
intelligently?
do
you
have
problem
with
that?
unknown
speaker
all
your
clients
run
out
of
money?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
it
has
been
adopted
since
the?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
what
answer
--
the
procedure
now
when
a
judgment
is
then
entered
by
confession,
a
notice
goes
to
the
--
unknown
speaker
well,
what
i
am
trying
to
get
at
is,
the
debtor
gets
that
notice,
how
many
days
before
his
property
may
be
put
for
sale?
unknown
speaker
that
issue
is
when?
unknown
speaker
well,
can
it
issue
simultaneously
with
the
notice
to
the
debtor?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
soon
may
the
property
be
put
up
for
sale
from
the
date
of
the
sending
of
the
notice
of
the
entry
of
the
judgment?
unknown
speaker
but
if
that
goes
on
to
the
day
that
the
judgment
has
entered
that
it
had
20
days
from
the
entry
of
the
judgment
--
unknown
speaker
does
differ
by
county
and
states?
unknown
speaker
these
executions
are
out
of
court,
they
are
not
judicial
foreclosures?
unknown
speaker
in
to
your
notice
of
execution
in
the
case
of
personally
what
do
you
do?
do
you
give
the
(inaudible)
of
execution
to
a
sheriff
and
he
goes
to
seize
the
properties
or
what?
unknown
speaker
then
it
is
sold
without
any
further
court
order
or
anything?
unknown
speaker
and,
what
tweaks
the
notice
of
execution
with
respect
to
personally?
there
is
at
least
20
days
before
the
sale?
unknown
speaker
what
i
intend
to
notice
is
the
execution
to
the
debt,
until
then
you
cannot
cease
the
property
at
least.
unknown
speaker
alright,
alright.
but
you
sent
in
the
notice
of
execution.
he
has
20
days
before
the
property
can
be
seized
by
the
sheriff?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
seizure?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
we
are
talking
about
personal
property
and
un-mortgaged
personal
property
and
you
simply
get
a
lien
on
it
by
having
a
debt,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
alright,
alright
well
then
you
do
not
get
a
lien
but
you
have
the
right
to
seize
it
and
sale
it,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
that
is
right
and
how
soon
could
you
seize
it
after
you
get
notice
of
execution?
unknown
speaker
20
days,
i
want
to
sell
it.
unknown
speaker
but
now,
there
is
a
motion
meanwhile
within
the
20
days
made
to
strike
the
judgment,
what
happens
to
all
these
procedures
and
execution
and
sale?
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
not
automatically
staid?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
but
it
is
not
automatically
staid
--
unknown
speaker
it
is
possible
then
notwithstanding
there
is
a
pending
motion
to
strike
the
judgment,
it
is
possible
i
gather,
if
court
does
not
grant
a
staid,
whatever
reason
it
denies
it,
that
the
property
may
be
sold
in
execution?
unknown
speaker
well,
one
other
thing
though,
i
take
it
none
of
this
happens
if
you
proceed
in
assumpsit,
if
the
creditor
proceeds
simply
in
assumpsit
under
debt
against
the
debtor
then
there
has
to
be
notice
in
defense
and
trial
and
everything
else,
and
his
judgment
is
never
or
his
property
is
never
imperiled
until
after
a
judgment
following
a
jury
trial
or
something
they
can
do
it,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
well
i
appreciate
that
but
nevertheless;
until
he
had
notice,
an
opportunity
to
define
no
judgment
entered
upon
which
it
can
be
executed.
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
difference
between
the
confession
that
occurs
and
the
confession
though
than
the
ordinary
--
unknown
speaker
mr.
patterson,
is
the
duty
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
pennsylvania
to
defend
the
constitutionality
of
the
law
that
acted
by
the
legislature
of
that
state?
unknown
speaker
but
here
they
take
a
dice
so
to
speak?
unknown
speaker
they
joined
the
appellants
and
say
that
the
court,
that
the
only
error
in
the
court
to
say
the
decision
was
that
it
did
not
go
that
far
enough
in
holding
this
law
unconstitutional
--
unknown
speaker
but
we
do
not
have
an
adversary
proceeding
here
in
this
court,
do
we?
there
was
no
cross-appeal,
there
is
nobody
here
asserting
that
the
district
court
was
wrong
in
going
so
far
as
it
did,
is
it
correct?
unknown
speaker
that
is
as
far
as
you
have
been
told
though,
there
having
been
no
cross-appeal,
all
you
can
do
is
defend
the
district
court’s
decision
which
held
prothonotary,
these
laws
constitutionally
invalid?
unknown
speaker
they
did
not
say
anything
--
unknown
speaker
is
that
enough?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
you
are
not
main
defendants
nor
any
of
your
--
unknown
speaker
and
you
were
in
as
amicus?
unknown
speaker
and
amicus
here?
unknown
speaker
i
take
that
it
has
been
foreclosed
without
it.
you
do
not
need
this
provision
to
foreclose
it?
unknown
speaker
yes.
(voice
overlap)
unknown
speaker
but
only
bond
foreclosure
you
do
it
outside
the
court?
unknown
speaker
on
the
mortgage?
unknown
speaker
that
is
correct.
unknown
speaker
but
not
right.
do
they
have
proceedings
of
right?
unknown
speaker
the
stay
is
granted
pending
determination
on
whether
the
judgment
will
be
reopen?
unknown
speaker
but
the
reopening
is
not
a
formality?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
mr.
matz,
do
you
know
whether
that
is
the
same
with
personally?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
have
in
footnote
1
on
page
12
of
your
brief,
what
you
say
is
a
typical
wording
of
such
a
clause?
unknown
speaker
is
there
anywhere
in
the
appendix
or
elsewhere
where
we
could
see
how
it
looks
in
print,
if
you
just
referred
it
to
fine
print?
unknown
speaker
in
the
initial
records?
unknown
speaker
they
are
here
in
the
appendix
that
would
show
as
that?
unknown
speaker
we
just
have
the
original
one?
unknown
speaker
alright,
thank
you.
but
this,
the
wording
is
how
a
typical
one
appears,
do
i
it
right
on
footnote
1
on
page
12
of
your
brief?
unknown
speaker
but
what
he
is
saying
is
he
could
not
afford
common
pleas
court
on
monday
and
say
now,
i
want
to
tender
evidence
and
defenses
of
this
proposed
action.
i
want
to
tender
evidence
of
breach
of
warranty.
you
are
telling
us
he
could
not
be
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
he
would
have
to
start
to
saying,
in
your
view
some
original
action
to
get
an
injunction
against
there
being
any
proceeding
of
the
judgment
notices,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
well
suppose
that
the
judgment
is
open?
what
then
happens
is
there
any
further
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
but
what
is
the
hearing
on
the
merits?
is
that
involved
with
jury
trial?
unknown
speaker
and
going
back
to
the
hypothetical,
i
suggest.
at
that
point
would
he
have
a
jury
determination
on
his
defense
of
breach
of
warranty?
unknown
speaker
how
does
he
show
that?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
merely
by
affidavit,
he
has
to
take
that
position,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
but
supposing
he
wanted
to
rely
only
on
affidavits
only?
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand
you,
all
that
he
gets
is
that
whether
his
affidavit
of
deposition
was
that
the
judgment
is
open
for
the
purposes
of
the
hearing?
unknown
speaker
and
that
maybe
a
hearing
at
which,
there
may
be
a
jury
trial.
unknown
speaker
alright!
unknown
speaker
now
incidentally,
in
this
instance,
you
do
not
have
the
forms
before
it,
but
are
these
all
of
the
printed
forms?
unknown
speaker
the
one
that
has
the
clause
at
the
bottom
of
page
12,
the
confession-of-judgment
clause.
are
they
in
a
printed
form
that
is
what
i
am
trying
to
get
at
or
what
are
they?
unknown
speaker
we
do
not
have
that
is
why
i
am
asking
you.
they
are
in
original
record
but
we
do
not
have
it
here.
unknown
speaker
we
have
the
original
record
here.
unknown
speaker
they
are
not
here
on
the
bench.
i
cannot
see
them
before
me,
that
is
why
i
am
asking
the
questions.
unknown
speaker
what
it
takes
to
spend
--
some
form
of
a
contract
in
appliance
that
he
uses,
for
example
is
something
like
that?
unknown
speaker
are
they
printed
form?
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
i
am
trying
to
find
out.
unknown
speaker
who
is
lennox?
is
he
a
state
officer?
unknown
speaker
sheriff
of
philadelphia.
unknown
speaker
and
lennox
took
no
cross-appeal?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
what
he
is
doing
right
here,
right?
unknown
speaker
what
is
unconstitutional
about
someone
who
knows
what
he
is
doing,
waiving
his
right?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
no
one
could
understand
that?
unknown
speaker
let
us
assume,
we
got
the
kind
of
a
notice
that
you
wanted
and
understood
exactly
what
kind
of
a
hearing
was
going
to
be
held,
namely
that
they
are
going
to
go
into
the
voluntariness,
intelligence
of
his
waiver
and
that
if
he
waives
why
he
is
going
to
have
his
judgment
against
himself.
let
us
assume
he
got
all
of
the
notice
he
wants.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
do
not
claim
there
and
as
i
understand
that
a
voluntary,
knowing,
intelligent
waiver
is
un-acceptable
constitutionally
to
dispense
with
notice
of
hearing
before
a
judgment.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say
that
nobody
should
be
committed
constitutionally
to
waive
notice
of
the
entry
of
judgment.
unknown
speaker
alright.
unknown
speaker
then,
i
just
wanted
this.
unknown
speaker
mr.
scholl,
if
you
prevail
here,
do
you
raise
any
question
as
to
the
validity
of
closed
and
past
transactions
in
pennsylvania.
in
other
words,
i
would
like
a
comment
from
you
on
the
retrospectivity
feature,
if
you
should
prevail?
unknown
speaker
you
are
suggesting
that
the
statute
might
be
alright
as
between
corporations
and
understanding
people?
but
not
with
respect
with
consumer?
unknown
speaker
in
fact,
it
really
is
not,
you
are
suggesting
that
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
well,
does
the
judgment
below
apply
to
the
corporation
under
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
only
the
individuals,
do
you
say?
unknown
speaker
earning
under
that
--
the
court
suggests
--
what
was
the
basis
of
the
$10,000.00?
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
suggestion
that
anyone
who
earns
$10,000.00
or
under
has
necessary
purpose.
unknown
speaker
it
is
just
that
the
only
proofs
you
had
for
the
people
you
are
representing
were
people
who
earned
not
more
than
$10,000.00,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
but
under
the
judgment
below,
what
is
the
standing
of
the
pennsylvania
statute
on
its
face?
unknown
speaker
then
what
is
your
quarrel?
what
it
is?
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
represent
anybody
that
makes
more
than
$10,000?
unknown
speaker
that
may
be
another
case.
you
do
not
represent
--
nobody
here
in
that
category,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
that
answers
to
justice
brennan?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
any
event,
i
gather
that
anyone
earning
under
$10,000.00
is
subject
to
this
waiver
in
face
of
this?
unknown
speaker
so
none
of
the
people
you
represent
has
any
protection
unless,
he
can
leave
that
hurdle,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
but
as
i
get
it.
the
person
earning
under
$10,000.00
has
no
protection.
if
in
fact,
it
is
establish
that
he
waive
these?
unknown
speaker
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
that
your
understanding
and
intelligent,
voluntarily
or
--
unknown
speaker
before
whom
does
the
hearing
take
place?
unknown
speaker
but
if
the
creditor
who
wants
his
judgment
as
the
person
who
earns
under
less
than
$10,000.00
is
the
one
who
has
to
initiate?
initiate
it.
unknown
speaker
before
he
can
go
forward
on
his
judgment.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that
satisfied
you
from
your
previous
argument?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
no
matter
how
intelligent
and
voluntary,
but
not
it
is?
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
cross-appeal
here,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
in
the
court
below
as
i
understand
it,
that
held
that
there
has
not
been
a
legal
waiver
on
the
part
of
any
of
these
people.
unknown
speaker
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
so,
where
is
your
case
of
controversy
here?
unknown
speaker
but
there
is
nobody
here
over
$10,000.00
and
there
is
no
cross
appeal?
unknown
speaker
that
does
not
make
it
necessarily
a
case
of
controversy.
unknown
speaker
including
that
the
court
was
wrong
on
people
under
$10,000.00?
unknown
speaker
may
i,
i
just
do
not
understand
this.
if
you
were
to
prevail
people
over
$10,000.00,
that
is
you
are
having
been
brought
here
by
the
other
side
who
prevailed
as
the
people
who
get
earning
under
$10,000.00,
are
you
suggesting
that
what
we
have
to
do
is
reverse
this
judgment,
if
they
won
below
even
if
they
are
the
appellants?
and
you
did
not
cross-appeal?
unknown
speaker
the
appellees
bring
it
up.
unknown
speaker
but
by
not
taking
a
cross-appeal,
does
it
not
follow
that
you
are
not
quarreling
with
that
part
of
the,
with
the
three-judge
court's
decision
that
held
this
pennsylvania
procedure,
constitutionally
invalid?
unknown
speaker
that
people
under
$10,000.00
except,
except
when
secured
by
mortgages
or
except
when
it
could
be
shown
that
they
did
this
knowingly
and
intelligently?
do
you
have
problem
with
that?
unknown
speaker
all
your
clients
run
out
of
money?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
it
has
been
adopted
since
the?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
what
answer
--
the
procedure
now
when
a
judgment
is
then
entered
by
confession,
a
notice
goes
to
the
--
unknown
speaker
well,
what
i
am
trying
to
get
at
is,
the
debtor
gets
that
notice,
how
many
days
before
his
property
may
be
put
for
sale?
unknown
speaker
that
issue
is
when?
unknown
speaker
well,
can
it
issue
simultaneously
with
the
notice
to
the
debtor?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
soon
may
the
property
be
put
up
for
sale
from
the
date
of
the
sending
of
the
notice
of
the
entry
of
the
judgment?
unknown
speaker
but
if
that
goes
on
to
the
day
that
the
judgment
has
entered
that
it
had
20
days
from
the
entry
of
the
judgment
--
unknown
speaker
does
differ
by
county
and
states?
unknown
speaker
these
executions
are
out
of
court,
they
are
not
judicial
foreclosures?
unknown
speaker
in
to
your
notice
of
execution
in
the
case
of
personally
what
do
you
do?
do
you
give
the
(inaudible)
of
execution
to
a
sheriff
and
he
goes
to
seize
the
properties
or
what?
unknown
speaker
then
it
is
sold
without
any
further
court
order
or
anything?
unknown
speaker
and,
what
tweaks
the
notice
of
execution
with
respect
to
personally?
there
is
at
least
20
days
before
the
sale?
unknown
speaker
what
i
intend
to
notice
is
the
execution
to
the
debt,
until
then
you
cannot
cease
the
property
at
least.
unknown
speaker
alright,
alright.
but
you
sent
in
the
notice
of
execution.
he
has
20
days
before
the
property
can
be
seized
by
the
sheriff?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
seizure?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
we
are
talking
about
personal
property
and
un-mortgaged
personal
property
and
you
simply
get
a
lien
on
it
by
having
a
debt,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
alright,
alright
well
then
you
do
not
get
a
lien
but
you
have
the
right
to
seize
it
and
sale
it,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
that
is
right
and
how
soon
could
you
seize
it
after
you
get
notice
of
execution?
unknown
speaker
20
days,
i
want
to
sell
it.
unknown
speaker
but
now,
there
is
a
motion
meanwhile
within
the
20
days
made
to
strike
the
judgment,
what
happens
to
all
these
procedures
and
execution
and
sale?
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
not
automatically
staid?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
but
it
is
not
automatically
staid
--
unknown
speaker
it
is
possible
then
notwithstanding
there
is
a
pending
motion
to
strike
the
judgment,
it
is
possible
i
gather,
if
court
does
not
grant
a
staid,
whatever
reason
it
denies
it,
that
the
property
may
be
sold
in
execution?
unknown
speaker
well,
one
other
thing
though,
i
take
it
none
of
this
happens
if
you
proceed
in
assumpsit,
if
the
creditor
proceeds
simply
in
assumpsit
under
debt
against
the
debtor
then
there
has
to
be
notice
in
defense
and
trial
and
everything
else,
and
his
judgment
is
never
or
his
property
is
never
imperiled
until
after
a
judgment
following
a
jury
trial
or
something
they
can
do
it,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
well
i
appreciate
that
but
nevertheless;
until
he
had
notice,
an
opportunity
to
define
no
judgment
entered
upon
which
it
can
be
executed.
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
difference
between
the
confession
that
occurs
and
the
confession
though
than
the
ordinary
--
unknown
speaker
mr.
patterson,
is
the
duty
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
pennsylvania
to
defend
the
constitutionality
of
the
law
that
acted
by
the
legislature
of
that
state?
unknown
speaker
but
here
they
take
a
dice
so
to
speak?
unknown
speaker
they
joined
the
appellants
and
say
that
the
court,
that
the
only
error
in
the
court
to
say
the
decision
was
that
it
did
not
go
that
far
enough
in
holding
this
law
unconstitutional
--
unknown
speaker
but
we
do
not
have
an
adversary
proceeding
here
in
this
court,
do
we?
there
was
no
cross-appeal,
there
is
nobody
here
asserting
that
the
district
court
was
wrong
in
going
so
far
as
it
did,
is
it
correct?
unknown
speaker
that
is
as
far
as
you
have
been
told
though,
there
having
been
no
cross-appeal,
all
you
can
do
is
defend
the
district
court’s
decision
which
held
prothonotary,
these
laws
constitutionally
invalid?
unknown
speaker
they
did
not
say
anything
--
unknown
speaker
is
that
enough?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
you
are
not
main
defendants
nor
any
of
your
--
unknown
speaker
and
you
were
in
as
amicus?
unknown
speaker
and
amicus
here?
unknown
speaker
i
take
that
it
has
been
foreclosed
without
it.
you
do
not
need
this
provision
to
foreclose
it?
unknown
speaker
yes.
(voice
overlap)
unknown
speaker
but
only
bond
foreclosure
you
do
it
outside
the
court?
unknown
speaker
on
the
mortgage?
unknown
speaker
that
is
correct.
unknown
speaker
but
not
right.
do
they
have
proceedings
of
right?
unknown
speaker
the
stay
is
granted
pending
determination
on
whether
the
judgment
will
be
reopen?
unknown
speaker
but
the
reopening
is
not
a
formality?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
mr.
matz,
do
you
know
whether
that
is
the
same
with
personally?
