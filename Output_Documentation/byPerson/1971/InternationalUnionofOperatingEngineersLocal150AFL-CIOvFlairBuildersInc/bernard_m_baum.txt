mr.
bernard
m.
baum
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
an
action
brought
under
section
301,
the
labor
management
relations
act
requesting
the
enforcement
of
the
demand
for
arbitration.
the
complaint
as
amended
was
dismissed
by
the
district
court,
which
found
that
although
the
company
in
this
case
was
bound
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
to
arbitrate
labor
disputes
within
the
scope
of
that
agreement
that
it
was
unenforceable,
since
the
union
was
guilty
of
laches.
on
appeal,
the
decision
of
the
district
court
was
affirmed,
judge
stevens
dissenting.
thereafter,
the
fourth
circuit
rendered
a
decision
in
which
it
held
that
laches
should
be
a
question
for
the
arbitrator
and
not
for
the
court
and
specifically
disagree
with
the
case
at
bar.
accordingly,
an
issue
which
we
have
presented
to
this
court
is
whether
once
a
court
has
determined
that
a
labor
dispute
is
arbitrable
under
the
terms
of
a
contract
should
the
issue
of
laches
or
the
question
of
delay,
be
determined
by
the
arbitrator
or
the
court.
in
this
regard,
what
occurred
in
this
case
before
the
district
court
is
most
pertinent
to
a
determination
of
this
issue.
on
may
22,
1964
the
union
and
the
employer
entered
into
a
memorandum
of
agreement
which
bound
the
company
and
the
union
to
a
master
agreement
which
had
been
negotiated
between
the
union
and
employer
association.
the
memorandum
of
agreement
provided
that
the
company
would
be
bound
to
the
initial
master
agreement
and
also
subsequent
master
agreements,
unless
they
terminated
at
the
time
that
the
first
agreement
was
expiring
or
any
subsequent
agreement.
now,
the
initial
agreement,
the
memorandum
as
i
said
was
signed
in
may
22,
1964.
the
initial
master
agreement
expired
in
may
31,
1966
and
thereafter,
on
june
1
a
new
agreement
came
into
effect
which
it
was
to
expire
on
may
31
of
1970.
now,
in
this
regard
again,
i
should
note
to
the
court
that
there
is
no
issue
in
this
case.
that
the
district
court
found
that
there
was
binding
agreement
between
the
parties.
and
there
was
no
issue
on
appeal
regarding
the
binding
nature
of
the
agreement.
the
issue
came
as
the
decision
of
the
question
of
laches.
now,
during
the
course
of
the
second
agreement
or
approximately
of
november
7,
1968,
we
filed
a
complaint
on
the
district
court
requesting
pursuant
to
section
301
stating
that
the
employer
had
disregarded
the
agreement
that
refuse
to
pay
the
wages
and
conditions
under
the
agreement
and
further
had
refuse
to
comply
with
the
hiring
arrangements
which
are
under
the
contract.
we
ask
in
that
case
for
specific
performance
of
the
agreement.
mr.
bernard
m.
baum
well,
at
that
point
there
had
only
been
one
employee.
mr.
bernard
m.
baum
at
that
point,
involved
an
operating
engineer.
mr.
bernard
m.
baum
right!
of
course
our
contention
your
honor
is
that
there
were
several
other
employees
that
would
have
been
in
the
bargaining
agreement
during
the
course
of
this
agreement
had
the
employer
complied.
and
i
think
that's
one
of
the
very
fundamental
issues
in
the
arbitration.
now,
what
happened
here
was
that
the
district
court
said,
i
think
that
the
threshold
issue
should
be
determined
by
the
arbitrator
under
the
terms
of
this
contract
and
i
shouldn't
decide
it.
so,
we
went
ahead,
and
this
was
in
april
of
1968
where
the
master
agreement
still
had
13
months
to
run,
and
pursuant
to
the
court
directive
made
a
demand
on
the
company
for
arbitration
of
the
contract
issue
and
in
addition
made
a
demand
for
the
other
issues
--
the
arbitration
of
the
other
issues
which
has
been
set
forth
in
the
complaint.
the
court,
the
counsel
for
the
company
then
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss,
alleging
laches
is
a
defense.
the
district
court
then
held
that
laches
was
an
issue
for
the
arbitrator
and
not
for
the
court
under
this
courts
decision
in
wiley.
thereafter,
the
court
ordered
a
hearing
on
the
merits
of
the
case
limited
to
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
there
was
contract,
the
threshold
question.
as
a
matter
of
fact
during
the
course
of
the
hearing,
the
district
court
again
stated
its
position
of
the
issue
of
laches
was
for
the
arbitrator
and
not
for
the
court
and
further
stated
that
it
found
that
a
binding
collective
bargaining
agreement
was
an
existence.
however,
at
the
conclusion
of
the
hearing,
the
court
rendered
a
memorandum
of
opinion.
in
which
it
now
found,
yes,
there
was
a
binding
contract
but
that
the
union
was
guilty
of
laches
in
terms
of
it
is
bringing
the
action
and
accordingly
it
was
unenforceable.
now
at
the
hearing,
we
in
fact
never
had
a
specific
hearing
on
the
question
of
laches
because
of
the
courts
position
but
that
was
not
an
issue
for
it
to
determine,
and
in
fact
when
the
employer
raised
the
issue
at
the
hearing,
the
court
attempted
to
limit
our
cross
examination
of
the
employer
in
the
case
who
was
obviously
the
company's
chief
witness
to
five
minutes
because
he
had
already
engaged
in
the
long
colloquy
with
counsel
for
the
company.
pointing
out
that
the
only
thing
he
was
interested
in
was
determining
the
binding
nature
of
the
contract.
so
that
i
do
not
feel
that
other
than
the
question
of
the
contract
itself,
there
were
any
other
significant
facts.
there
was
some
evidence
that
there
from
the
union's
point
of
view
that
there
had
been
contacts.
the
employer
denied
any
contacts
during
the
term
of
the
contract
and
the
court
in
changing
its
position
from
the
position
which
had
held
during
the
hearing
from
the
position
that
it
held
in
its
memorandum,
not
permitting
counsels
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
wiley
case
that
he
was
crediting
the
company's
testimony
regarding
laches
even
though
frankly
we
have
had
no
hearing
on
laches.
now,
i
think
in
terms
of
the
argument
in
this
case
there
are
three
essential
considerations
which
the
court
must
make.
our
position
is
first
that
the
defensive
laches
clearly
falls
within
the
rational
of
this
court's
decision
in
wiley
is
particularly
illustrated
by
what
happened
before
the
district
court.
the
district
court
initially
said
the
threshold
issue
of
the
contract
existence
was
for
the
arbitrator.
we
then
follow
the
courts
admonition
and
demanded
arbitration.
and
in
fact,
as
the
court
indicates
in
its
subsequent
memo
on
the
motion
to
dismiss.
we
pointed
out
to
the
court
that
this
court
had
pointed,
had
stated
that
the
threshold
issue
was
in
fact
for
the
court
and
not
the
arbitrator.
and
subsequently
did
determine
that
threshold
issue
as
a
binding
contract.
the
court
then
said
laches
wasn't
for
the
court
but
for
the
arbitrator
and
then
change
its
position.
now,
what
happened?
laches
is
an
equitable
defense
obviously
with
common
law.
it
has
two
elements.
normally,
it
has
a
question
of
delay
and
also
a
question
of
prejudice.
there
was
no
testimony
taken
on
the
issue
of
prejudice
and
there
was
very
little
testimony
other
than
the
question
of
delay
here.
now,
frankly
had
the
court
said
to
us,
i
am
going
to
determine
the
issue
of
laches
in
this
case.
what
we
would
have
done
is
to
have
presented
our
case
on
the
merits
because
here
we
had
an
employer
with
a
continuing
violation
of
the
contract
that
it
disregarded
it
since
the
first
employee
had
become
a
member
of
the
union.
we
had
a
situation
where
the
employer
had
refused
to
pay
the
wages
and
working
conditions,
and
it
simply
ignored
the
contract.
so
obviously
we
would
have
had
to
present
our
entire
case
in
the
merits.
we
would
have
subpoenaed
the
company's
books
and
records
to
determine
what
employees
were
involved
because
obviously
this
would
relate
to
a
defense
in
this
kind
of
the
case.
in
other
words
it
would
have
been
--
this
hearing
in
fact
took
less
than
two
hours.
had
we
--
had
the
court
said
we
are
going
to
have
a
hearing
on
the
issue
of
laches
it
would
have
taken
two
or
three
days.
mr.
bernard
m.
baum
no,
sir.
no,
your
honor,
i
am
not
going
beyond
that
at
all.
i
am
making
the
point
that
what
happens
in
the
wiley
decision.
this
court
says,
except
for
four
reasons
why
they
felt
that
issues
delay
should
go
to
the
arbitrator
and
not
to
the
court.
they
said,
first
of
all
it's
very
difficult
to
separate
an
issue
of
delay
from
the
issue
of
merits.
i
am
pointing
out
that
frankly
had
we
had
to
go
into
the
issue
of
delay,
which
here
was
called
laches,
it
could
have
been
called
waiver,
you
could
have
called
procedural
delay.
we
would
have
been
required
to
go
into
a
long
and
lengthy
hearing
on
the
merits,
and
the
court
points
out
in
wiley
where
there
is
an
agreement
to
arbitrate
the
issues.
the
federal
courts
should
not
get
into
this
issue,
they
have
enough
of
the
case
load
as
it
is.
the
parties
have
agreed
to
utilize
this
forum
and
obviously
this
should
be
a
decision
of
the
arbitrator
because
of
the
inability
to
separate
the
issue
of
laches
from
the
merits
of
the
case,
and
i
think
that
is
the
reason
i
am
making
the
point.
mr.
bernard
m.
baum
i
think
that's
true,
and
i
think
it
would
--
the
law
obviously
in
the
question
of
common
law
of
the
law
of
equity.
the
quest
--
the
defense
of
laches
always
relates
to
the
facts
of
the
particular
case.
now,
in
this
case
not
only
do
you
have
to
worry
about
the
facts
of
the
particular
case
but
you
have
a
bargaining
relationship
to
be
concerned
with,
you
have
a
continuing
problem
of
violation,
of
a
bargaining
relationship
because
as
i
pointed
out
to
the
court
before
when
a
demand
for
arbitration
was
made,
we
still
had
13
months
to
run
on
the
contract.
so
that
there
--
that
even
if
there
might
be
some
question
of
delay
which
might
affect
the
ultimate
decision
of
the
arbitrator.
there
is
certainly
could
be
no
question
of
delay
as
it
related
to
the
final
13
months
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
now,
i
think
the
second
consideration
in
this
case
would
be
the
effect
on
the
federal
courts
if
we
were
to
get
into
a
situation
where
courts
are
going
to
start
determining
questions
of
delay.
every
time
a
party
to
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
wanted
to
disrupt
that
relationship
the
simplest
thing
they
could
do,
would
be
to
start
raising
these
defenses.
obviously,
the
purpose
of
arbitration
at
least
in
labor
management,
i
would
assume
in
commercial
manners,
is
that
there
is
a
forum
which
can
expedite
the
hearing
and
that
the
parties
have
this
kind
of
relationship.
it's
a
manner
which
they
choose.
and
if
we
get
--
if
we
start
raising
defenses
whether
it
be
waiver
or
estoppel,
or
we
call
it
procedural
delay,
or
we
call
it
laches,
still
delay
anyway.
we
are
going
to
start
delaying
the
process
of
arbitration.
and
any
party
that
wants
to
delay
the
process
of
arbitration
can
do
it
simply
by
raising
these
types
of
defenses.
and
i
think
this
court
in
its
decision
starting
with
textile
workers
going
through
the
steelworkers
trilogy,
going
through
the
recent
decision
in
boys
market
and
going
through
all
of
these
cases
is
the
theory
that
where
the
parties
have
agreed
and
they
are
going
to
arbitrate
the
case,
we
don't
want
that
kind
of
issue
on
the
federal
court,
it
should
be
determined
by
an
arbitrator.
and
that
is
exactly
what
we
are
talking
about
in
this
particular
case.
now,
the
third
element,
i
think
that
the
court
must
seriously
look
at
is
the
question
of
the
quid
pro
quo.
i
noted
in
reading
this
court's
decision
in
the
boys
market
case,
that
one
of
the
points
which
the
court
made
why
is
it
the
reason
that
they
thought
that
in
injunction
should
issue
and
sinclair
should
be
overruled
was
the
fact
that
the
employer
would
have
to
have
an
effective
system
of
making
arbitration
work
and
the
damages
were
not
always
the
answer
and
that
pointed
out
that
with
where
there
is
an
agreement
to
arbitrate
and
then
you
permit
a
strike,
you
are
derogating
the
need
for
the
employer
to
enter
into
the
agreement
which
provides
for
arbitration
because
you
are
saying
that
the
arbitration
procedure
is
meaningless.
now,
let's
turn
that
around
and
let's
put
the
foot
on
the
other
shoe
from
the
union's
point
of
view.
the
union
basically
has
the
right
to
strike.
that
is
its
economic
weapon
that
is
the
weapon
that
utilizes.
now,
when
you
take
that
weapon
and
you
say
to
the
union
give
that
weapon
up
during
the
term
of
the
contract,
we
want
industrial
peace.
but
we
will
substitute
for
that
the
process
of
arbitration.
and
then
you
make
that
process,
one
that
is
ineffective,
just
in
the
case
of
boys
market
on
the
employer
side
where
you
turn
it
around
to
the
union
side
it
makes
it
ineffective.
obviously,
i
think
the
quid
pro
quo
for
no
strike
is
arbitration.
it
is
not
litigation
in
the
federal
court.
now,
in
addition,
if
i
might
return
the
court
for
a
moment
to
the
issues
raised
the
considerations
in
wiley.
this
court
pointed
out
in
wiley
that
in
addition
to
the
problem
of
separating
the
marriage
from
the
procedural
issue.
we
had
a
question
of
delay.
this
case
is
over
three
years
old.
it
is
not
yet
come
before
the
arbitrator.
this
court
raise
the
question
in
wiley
of
the
cost
as
i
point
out
in
the
brief
and
i
think
this
case
so
appropriately
supports
this
court's
rational
in
wiley.
counsel
for
the
company,
advised
this
court
after
he
had
to
grant
the
certiorari
buy
the
company
didn't
have
money
to
prepare
a
brief
in
this
case.
and
we
pointed
out
that
could
have
happened
just
as
well
to
the
union
and
the
company
because
here
the
company
says,
they
don't
have
enough
money
to
take
this
case
to
the
highest
court.
we
do
not
raise
the
defensive
laches
either
but
the
cost
factor
can
work
either
way.
and
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
wiley,
this
is
correct.
this
is
exactly
what
happened
in
this
case.
now,
in
addition
the
court
in
wiley
also
talked
about
the
question
of
duplication
of
effort,
had
the
district
court
followed
through
with
this
original
decision
that
laches
was
for
the
arbitrator
and
not
for
the
court
then
counsel
for
the
company
could
have
easily
raised
the
issue
of
delay
before
the
arbitrator,
irrespective
of
what
we
call
it,
whether
we
call
it
laches,
whether
we
call
it
estoppel,
whether
we
call
it
waiver.
obviously,
i
think
that
the
--that
this
particular
case
falls
clearly
within
the
four
corners
of
this
courts
decision
in
wiley.
arbitration
frankly
is
a
process
which
if
it
does
not
work
or
does
not
operate,
really
serves
no
purpose,
now,
getting
back
for
a
moment
to
the
question
of
the
no
strike
provision
in
this
contract.
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
under
the
terms
of
this
particular
contract
the
union
had
a
right
to
strike
if
the
employer
did
not
pay
the
wages
and
did
not
pay
fringe
benefits.
we
could
have
proceeded
under
arbitration
or
we
could
have
struck.
yet,
we
chose
not
to
strike
the
employer
in
this
particular
case
and
we
chose
to
go
the
root
of
arbitration
and
not
create
any
kind
of
an
industrial
tie
up
so
that
i
think
the
facts
of
this
particular
contract.
the
facts
of
these
particular
case
show
that
not
only
did
we
have
a
broad
arbitration
clause
but
as
to
some
of
the
issues
raised
in
arbitration,
we
could
have
used
the
right
to
strike,
we
have
an
option
but
rather
we
chose
arbitration
because
we
did
not
want
to
in
any
way
affect
the
relationship.
so
that
creates
even
in
an
additional
policy
reason
why
in
this
particular
case,
delay
is
an
issue
for
the
arbitrator
and
not
for
the
court.
mr.
bernard
m.
baum
i
think
that
the
fact
--
what
little
facts
there
are
of
mr.
justice
powell
on
this
case,
was
a
fact
that
we
waited
until
we
had
concrete
situation
on
which
to
move
of
our
position
is
that
for
the
years
1964
through
1966,
the
work
was
subcontracted
to
a
subcontractor
which
obviously
would
be
an
issue,
in
the
arbitration.
that
in
1967
there
was
a
tremendous
turn
over
with
people.
however,
in
1968,
we
found
the
operator,
he
joined
the
union,
and
i
think
as
the
record
reflects,
we
filed
an
action
before
the
national
labor
relations
board
within
successfully
concluded
and
as
well
as
the
wage
and
hour
against
the
employer.
and
we
look
for
concrete
situation,
this
was
a
continuing
violation
and
we
were
waiting
until
we
had
a
tightly
concrete
situation.
now,
i
might
also
add
this
that
irrespective
of
the
question
of
even
what
happened
between
1966
and
68
which
frankly
i
think
is
a
question
of
fact
on
the
merits.
we
don't
have
all
the
merits
and
all
the
facts
before
us.
there
can
be
no
question
that
from
the
time
that
we
file
the
notice
of
arbitration
that
being
from
1968
until
the
conclusion
of
the
contract,
there
could
be
no
issue
with
delay.
it
might
be
frankly
that
an
arbitrator
might
take
the
position
that
because
we
waited
for
those
years,
there
might
not
be
any
remedial
thing
that
he
could
do
in
terms
of
back
pay.
but
obviously
that
would
have
to
come
out
in
terms
of
all
the
facts
in
this
case.
and
we
don't
have
all
the
facts
in
this
case
before
us,
and
that
really
creates
the
problem.
i
might
ask
the
chief
justice
if
i
could
reserve
five
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
bernard
m.
baum
mr.
chief
justice,
just
a
couple
of
comments
that
i
wish
to
address
to
the
court.
i
think
mr.
justice
rehnquist
was
correct,
when
he
noted
the
decision
of
the
district
court
at
page
149
of
the
abstract,
holding
that
there
was
a
contract
but
that
the
question
was
the
laches.
i
would
also
suggest
to
the
court
that
they
examine
page
93
of
the
abstract,
where
the
court
during
the
hearing,
specifically
stated
that
it
held
that
the
agreement
came
into
existence
and
held
that
there
was
an
agreement.
i
would
further
suggest
to
the
court
that
they
examine
page
156
of
the
abstract
being
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
this
case
in
which
they
say
their
issue
is
the
question
of
whether
a
party
to
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
which
contains
an
arbitration
clause
may
be
so
dilatory
in
making
the
existence
of
a
vaguely
delineated
disputes
known
to
the
other
party
that
the
court
is
justified
in
refusing
to
compel
the
submission.
the
point
is,
you
can't
get
to
the
issue
of
laches
unless
you
first
have
a
contract
because
why
would
you
want
to
reach
the
issue
of
laches
unless
you
first
have
a
contract.
if
you
have
no
binding
contract
there
is
no
issue
to
reach,
and
i
think
that
the
counsel
was
incorrect.
mr.
bernard
m.
baum
the
court
has
to
determine
whether
there
exists
an
agreement
obviously,
whether
the
parties
have
entered
into
a
written
agreement.
of
course,
they'd
probably
get
into
like
in
this
case.
we
have
an
entire
agreement
of
the
party's
clause
which
says
there
could
no
oral
agreements
or
understandings.
so
that
here,
the
written
agreement
is
the
binding
agreement
but
obviously
you
have
to
decide
that
question
but
you
can't
get
to
the
issue,
why
get
to
the
issue
of
the
laches
if
you
do
not
have
the
contract
in
the
first
place?
you
say
you
do
not
have
a
contract,
there
is
nothing
to
arbitrate.
mr.
bernard
m.
baum
well,
it
says
as
justice
rehnquist
referred,
accordingly,
i
have
determined
that
the
defendant
was
bound
by
the
memorandum
of
agreement
to
arbitrate
labor
disputes
who
can
limit
for
the
arbitration
clause.
and
then
he
says,
however
i
am
not
going
to
enforce
this
provision
because
i
believe
that
the
union
was
guilty
of
laches
here.
this
becomes
a
very
complicated
situation
because
moreover,
this
was
an
industrial
case,
this
is
a
construction
union
and
what
limited
facts
and
the
record
show
this
is
on
construction
sites,
several
sexes
are
major
issue
which
would
have
to
be
determined
in
this
case.
what
kind
of
relationship?
this
isn't
where
you
have
a
steward
everyday
in
a
plant.
this
is
construction,
there
is
several,
counties,
there
is
several
sites,
business
agents
are
going
around,
there
isn't
this
kind
of
a
situation
that
you
have
in
industrial
plant.
obviously,
an
arbitrator
is
going
to
determine
these
kinds
of
questions
because
that
was
one
of
the
issues
we
would
have
to
get
into.
if
the
court
in
fact
had
held
the
hearing
on
laches
here,
we'd
have
to
do
it
before
an
arbitrator.
and
obviously,
it
becomes
part
of
the
merits.
moreover,
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
one
final
thing.
the
counsel
says
that
the
tobacco
workers
case
says
that
there
are
different
kinds
of
laches.
i
would
suggest
and
i
think
that
reading
of
the
tobacco
workers
case
directly
says,
we
disagree
with
the
seventh
circuit.
we
think
they
say
the
flair
builders
case
as
far
as
the
fourth
circuit
is
concerned
is
wrong.
they
say
the
issue
should
have
been
for
the
arbitrator
and
not
for
the
court,
and
there
is
no
question.
they
don't
delineate
as
to
different
kinds
of
laches,
that
laches
is
delay,
its
waiver,
its
procedural
delay.
i
submit
that
there
is
no
difference,
and
i
submit
that
if
this
court
is
going
to
permit
these
kinds
of
issues
to
be
decided
by
the
courts
rather
than
the
arbitrators,
where
you
have
in
all
disputes
arbitration
clause
which
are
going
to
get
into
is
more
litigation
and
undermine
the
arbitration
process.
thank
you.
mr.
bernard
m.
baum
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
an
action
brought
under
section
301,
the
labor
management
relations
act
requesting
the
enforcement
of
the
demand
for
arbitration.
the
complaint
as
amended
was
dismissed
by
the
district
court,
which
found
that
although
the
company
in
this
case
was
bound
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
to
arbitrate
labor
disputes
within
the
scope
of
that
agreement
that
it
was
unenforceable,
since
the
union
was
guilty
of
laches.
on
appeal,
the
decision
of
the
district
court
was
affirmed,
judge
stevens
dissenting.
thereafter,
the
fourth
circuit
rendered
a
decision
in
which
it
held
that
laches
should
be
a
question
for
the
arbitrator
and
not
for
the
court
and
specifically
disagree
with
the
case
at
bar.
accordingly,
an
issue
which
we
have
presented
to
this
court
is
whether
once
a
court
has
determined
that
a
labor
dispute
is
arbitrable
under
the
terms
of
a
contract
should
the
issue
of
laches
or
the
question
of
delay,
be
determined
by
the
arbitrator
or
the
court.
in
this
regard,
what
occurred
in
this
case
before
the
district
court
is
most
pertinent
to
a
determination
of
this
issue.
on
may
22,
1964
the
union
and
the
employer
entered
into
a
memorandum
of
agreement
which
bound
the
company
and
the
union
to
a
master
agreement
which
had
been
negotiated
between
the
union
and
employer
association.
the
memorandum
of
agreement
provided
that
the
company
would
be
bound
to
the
initial
master
agreement
and
also
subsequent
master
agreements,
unless
they
terminated
at
the
time
that
the
first
agreement
was
expiring
or
any
subsequent
agreement.
now,
the
initial
agreement,
the
memorandum
as
i
said
was
signed
in
may
22,
1964.
the
initial
master
agreement
expired
in
may
31,
1966
and
thereafter,
on
june
1
a
new
agreement
came
into
effect
which
it
was
to
expire
on
may
31
of
1970.
now,
in
this
regard
again,
i
should
note
to
the
court
that
there
is
no
issue
in
this
case.
that
the
district
court
found
that
there
was
binding
agreement
between
the
parties.
and
there
was
no
issue
on
appeal
regarding
the
binding
nature
of
the
agreement.
the
issue
came
as
the
decision
of
the
question
of
laches.
now,
during
the
course
of
the
second
agreement
or
approximately
of
november
7,
1968,
we
filed
a
complaint
on
the
district
court
requesting
pursuant
to
section
301
stating
that
the
employer
had
disregarded
the
agreement
that
refuse
to
pay
the
wages
and
conditions
under
the
agreement
and
further
had
refuse
to
comply
with
the
hiring
arrangements
which
are
under
the
contract.
we
ask
in
that
case
for
specific
performance
of
the
agreement.
mr.
bernard
m.
baum
well,
at
that
point
there
had
only
been
one
employee.
mr.
bernard
m.
baum
at
that
point,
involved
an
operating
engineer.
mr.
bernard
m.
baum
right!
of
course
our
contention
your
honor
is
that
there
were
several
other
employees
that
would
have
been
in
the
bargaining
agreement
during
the
course
of
this
agreement
had
the
employer
complied.
and
i
think
that's
one
of
the
very
fundamental
issues
in
the
arbitration.
now,
what
happened
here
was
that
the
district
court
said,
i
think
that
the
threshold
issue
should
be
determined
by
the
arbitrator
under
the
terms
of
this
contract
and
i
shouldn't
decide
it.
so,
we
went
ahead,
and
this
was
in
april
of
1968
where
the
master
agreement
still
had
13
months
to
run,
and
pursuant
to
the
court
directive
made
a
demand
on
the
company
for
arbitration
of
the
contract
issue
and
in
addition
made
a
demand
for
the
other
issues
--
the
arbitration
of
the
other
issues
which
has
been
set
forth
in
the
complaint.
the
court,
the
counsel
for
the
company
then
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss,
alleging
laches
is
a
defense.
the
district
court
then
held
that
laches
was
an
issue
for
the
arbitrator
and
not
for
the
court
under
this
courts
decision
in
wiley.
thereafter,
the
court
ordered
a
hearing
on
the
merits
of
the
case
limited
to
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
there
was
contract,
the
threshold
question.
as
a
matter
of
fact
during
the
course
of
the
hearing,
the
district
court
again
stated
its
position
of
the
issue
of
laches
was
for
the
arbitrator
and
not
for
the
court
and
further
stated
that
it
found
that
a
binding
collective
bargaining
agreement
was
an
existence.
however,
at
the
conclusion
of
the
hearing,
the
court
rendered
a
memorandum
of
opinion.
in
which
it
now
found,
yes,
there
was
a
binding
contract
but
that
the
union
was
guilty
of
laches
in
terms
of
it
is
bringing
the
action
and
accordingly
it
was
unenforceable.
now
at
the
hearing,
we
in
fact
never
had
a
specific
hearing
on
the
question
of
laches
because
of
the
courts
position
but
that
was
not
an
issue
for
it
to
determine,
and
in
fact
when
the
employer
raised
the
issue
at
the
hearing,
the
court
attempted
to
limit
our
cross
examination
of
the
employer
in
the
case
who
was
obviously
the
company's
chief
witness
to
five
minutes
because
he
had
already
engaged
in
the
long
colloquy
with
counsel
for
the
company.
pointing
out
that
the
only
thing
he
was
interested
in
was
determining
the
binding
nature
of
the
contract.
so
that
i
do
not
feel
that
other
than
the
question
of
the
contract
itself,
there
were
any
other
significant
facts.
there
was
some
evidence
that
there
from
the
union's
point
of
view
that
there
had
been
contacts.
the
employer
denied
any
contacts
during
the
term
of
the
contract
and
the
court
in
changing
its
position
from
the
position
which
had
held
during
the
hearing
from
the
position
that
it
held
in
its
memorandum,
not
permitting
counsels
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
wiley
case
that
he
was
crediting
the
company's
testimony
regarding
laches
even
though
frankly
we
have
had
no
hearing
on
laches.
now,
i
think
in
terms
of
the
argument
in
this
case
there
are
three
essential
considerations
which
the
court
must
make.
our
position
is
first
that
the
defensive
laches
clearly
falls
within
the
rational
of
this
court's
decision
in
wiley
is
particularly
illustrated
by
what
happened
before
the
district
court.
the
district
court
initially
said
the
threshold
issue
of
the
contract
existence
was
for
the
arbitrator.
we
then
follow
the
courts
admonition
and
demanded
arbitration.
and
in
fact,
as
the
court
indicates
in
its
subsequent
memo
on
the
motion
to
dismiss.
we
pointed
out
to
the
court
that
this
court
had
pointed,
had
stated
that
the
threshold
issue
was
in
fact
for
the
court
and
not
the
arbitrator.
and
subsequently
did
determine
that
threshold
issue
as
a
binding
contract.
the
court
then
said
laches
wasn't
for
the
court
but
for
the
arbitrator
and
then
change
its
position.
now,
what
happened?
laches
is
an
equitable
defense
obviously
with
common
law.
it
has
two
elements.
normally,
it
has
a
question
of
delay
and
also
a
question
of
prejudice.
there
was
no
testimony
taken
on
the
issue
of
prejudice
and
there
was
very
little
testimony
other
than
the
question
of
delay
here.
now,
frankly
had
the
court
said
to
us,
i
am
going
to
determine
the
issue
of
laches
in
this
case.
what
we
would
have
done
is
to
have
presented
our
case
on
the
merits
because
here
we
had
an
employer
with
a
continuing
violation
of
the
contract
that
it
disregarded
it
since
the
first
employee
had
become
a
member
of
the
union.
we
had
a
situation
where
the
employer
had
refused
to
pay
the
wages
and
working
conditions,
and
it
simply
ignored
the
contract.
so
obviously
we
would
have
had
to
present
our
entire
case
in
the
merits.
we
would
have
subpoenaed
the
company's
books
and
records
to
determine
what
employees
were
involved
because
obviously
this
would
relate
to
a
defense
in
this
kind
of
the
case.
in
other
words
it
would
have
been
--
this
hearing
in
fact
took
less
than
two
hours.
had
we
--
had
the
court
said
we
are
going
to
have
a
hearing
on
the
issue
of
laches
it
would
have
taken
two
or
three
days.
mr.
bernard
m.
baum
no,
sir.
no,
your
honor,
i
am
not
going
beyond
that
at
all.
i
am
making
the
point
that
what
happens
in
the
wiley
decision.
this
court
says,
except
for
four
reasons
why
they
felt
that
issues
delay
should
go
to
the
arbitrator
and
not
to
the
court.
they
said,
first
of
all
it's
very
difficult
to
separate
an
issue
of
delay
from
the
issue
of
merits.
i
am
pointing
out
that
frankly
had
we
had
to
go
into
the
issue
of
delay,
which
here
was
called
laches,
it
could
have
been
called
waiver,
you
could
have
called
procedural
delay.
we
would
have
been
required
to
go
into
a
long
and
lengthy
hearing
on
the
merits,
and
the
court
points
out
in
wiley
where
there
is
an
agreement
to
arbitrate
the
issues.
the
federal
courts
should
not
get
into
this
issue,
they
have
enough
of
the
case
load
as
it
is.
the
parties
have
agreed
to
utilize
this
forum
and
obviously
this
should
be
a
decision
of
the
arbitrator
because
of
the
inability
to
separate
the
issue
of
laches
from
the
merits
of
the
case,
and
i
think
that
is
the
reason
i
am
making
the
point.
mr.
bernard
m.
baum
i
think
that's
true,
and
i
think
it
would
--
the
law
obviously
in
the
question
of
common
law
of
the
law
of
equity.
the
quest
--
the
defense
of
laches
always
relates
to
the
facts
of
the
particular
case.
now,
in
this
case
not
only
do
you
have
to
worry
about
the
facts
of
the
particular
case
but
you
have
a
bargaining
relationship
to
be
concerned
with,
you
have
a
continuing
problem
of
violation,
of
a
bargaining
relationship
because
as
i
pointed
out
to
the
court
before
when
a
demand
for
arbitration
was
made,
we
still
had
13
months
to
run
on
the
contract.
so
that
there
--
that
even
if
there
might
be
some
question
of
delay
which
might
affect
the
ultimate
decision
of
the
arbitrator.
there
is
certainly
could
be
no
question
of
delay
as
it
related
to
the
final
13
months
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
now,
i
think
the
second
consideration
in
this
case
would
be
the
effect
on
the
federal
courts
if
we
were
to
get
into
a
situation
where
courts
are
going
to
start
determining
questions
of
delay.
every
time
a
party
to
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
wanted
to
disrupt
that
relationship
the
simplest
thing
they
could
do,
would
be
to
start
raising
these
defenses.
obviously,
the
purpose
of
arbitration
at
least
in
labor
management,
i
would
assume
in
commercial
manners,
is
that
there
is
a
forum
which
can
expedite
the
hearing
and
that
the
parties
have
this
kind
of
relationship.
it's
a
manner
which
they
choose.
and
if
we
get
--
if
we
start
raising
defenses
whether
it
be
waiver
or
estoppel,
or
we
call
it
procedural
delay,
or
we
call
it
laches,
still
delay
anyway.
we
are
going
to
start
delaying
the
process
of
arbitration.
and
any
party
that
wants
to
delay
the
process
of
arbitration
can
do
it
simply
by
raising
these
types
of
defenses.
and
i
think
this
court
in
its
decision
starting
with
textile
workers
going
through
the
steelworkers
trilogy,
going
through
the
recent
decision
in
boys
market
and
going
through
all
of
these
cases
is
the
theory
that
where
the
parties
have
agreed
and
they
are
going
to
arbitrate
the
case,
we
don't
want
that
kind
of
issue
on
the
federal
court,
it
should
be
determined
by
an
arbitrator.
and
that
is
exactly
what
we
are
talking
about
in
this
particular
case.
now,
the
third
element,
i
think
that
the
court
must
seriously
look
at
is
the
question
of
the
quid
pro
quo.
i
noted
in
reading
this
court's
decision
in
the
boys
market
case,
that
one
of
the
points
which
the
court
made
why
is
it
the
reason
that
they
thought
that
in
injunction
should
issue
and
sinclair
should
be
overruled
was
the
fact
that
the
employer
would
have
to
have
an
effective
system
of
making
arbitration
work
and
the
damages
were
not
always
the
answer
and
that
pointed
out
that
with
where
there
is
an
agreement
to
arbitrate
and
then
you
permit
a
strike,
you
are
derogating
the
need
for
the
employer
to
enter
into
the
agreement
which
provides
for
arbitration
because
you
are
saying
that
the
arbitration
procedure
is
meaningless.
now,
let's
turn
that
around
and
let's
put
the
foot
on
the
other
shoe
from
the
union's
point
of
view.
the
union
basically
has
the
right
to
strike.
that
is
its
economic
weapon
that
is
the
weapon
that
utilizes.
now,
when
you
take
that
weapon
and
you
say
to
the
union
give
that
weapon
up
during
the
term
of
the
contract,
we
want
industrial
peace.
but
we
will
substitute
for
that
the
process
of
arbitration.
and
then
you
make
that
process,
one
that
is
ineffective,
just
in
the
case
of
boys
market
on
the
employer
side
where
you
turn
it
around
to
the
union
side
it
makes
it
ineffective.
obviously,
i
think
the
quid
pro
quo
for
no
strike
is
arbitration.
it
is
not
litigation
in
the
federal
court.
now,
in
addition,
if
i
might
return
the
court
for
a
moment
to
the
issues
raised
the
considerations
in
wiley.
this
court
pointed
out
in
wiley
that
in
addition
to
the
problem
of
separating
the
marriage
from
the
procedural
issue.
we
had
a
question
of
delay.
this
case
is
over
three
years
old.
it
is
not
yet
come
before
the
arbitrator.
this
court
raise
the
question
in
wiley
of
the
cost
as
i
point
out
in
the
brief
and
i
think
this
case
so
appropriately
supports
this
court's
rational
in
wiley.
counsel
for
the
company,
advised
this
court
after
he
had
to
grant
the
certiorari
buy
the
company
didn't
have
money
to
prepare
a
brief
in
this
case.
and
we
pointed
out
that
could
have
happened
just
as
well
to
the
union
and
the
company
because
here
the
company
says,
they
don't
have
enough
money
to
take
this
case
to
the
highest
court.
we
do
not
raise
the
defensive
laches
either
but
the
cost
factor
can
work
either
way.
and
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
wiley,
this
is
correct.
this
is
exactly
what
happened
in
this
case.
now,
in
addition
the
court
in
wiley
also
talked
about
the
question
of
duplication
of
effort,
had
the
district
court
followed
through
with
this
original
decision
that
laches
was
for
the
arbitrator
and
not
for
the
court
then
counsel
for
the
company
could
have
easily
raised
the
issue
of
delay
before
the
arbitrator,
irrespective
of
what
we
call
it,
whether
we
call
it
laches,
whether
we
call
it
estoppel,
whether
we
call
it
waiver.
obviously,
i
think
that
the
--that
this
particular
case
falls
clearly
within
the
four
corners
of
this
courts
decision
in
wiley.
arbitration
frankly
is
a
process
which
if
it
does
not
work
or
does
not
operate,
really
serves
no
purpose,
now,
getting
back
for
a
moment
to
the
question
of
the
no
strike
provision
in
this
contract.
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
under
the
terms
of
this
particular
contract
the
union
had
a
right
to
strike
if
the
employer
did
not
pay
the
wages
and
did
not
pay
fringe
benefits.
we
could
have
proceeded
under
arbitration
or
we
could
have
struck.
yet,
we
chose
not
to
strike
the
employer
in
this
particular
case
and
we
chose
to
go
the
root
of
arbitration
and
not
create
any
kind
of
an
industrial
tie
up
so
that
i
think
the
facts
of
this
particular
contract.
the
facts
of
these
particular
case
show
that
not
only
did
we
have
a
broad
arbitration
clause
but
as
to
some
of
the
issues
raised
in
arbitration,
we
could
have
used
the
right
to
strike,
we
have
an
option
but
rather
we
chose
arbitration
because
we
did
not
want
to
in
any
way
affect
the
relationship.
so
that
creates
even
in
an
additional
policy
reason
why
in
this
particular
case,
delay
is
an
issue
for
the
arbitrator
and
not
for
the
court.
mr.
bernard
m.
baum
i
think
that
the
fact
--
what
little
facts
there
are
of
mr.
justice
powell
on
this
case,
was
a
fact
that
we
waited
until
we
had
concrete
situation
on
which
to
move
of
our
position
is
that
for
the
years
1964
through
1966,
the
work
was
subcontracted
to
a
subcontractor
which
obviously
would
be
an
issue,
in
the
arbitration.
that
in
1967
there
was
a
tremendous
turn
over
with
people.
however,
in
1968,
we
found
the
operator,
he
joined
the
union,
and
i
think
as
the
record
reflects,
we
filed
an
action
before
the
national
labor
relations
board
within
successfully
concluded
and
as
well
as
the
wage
and
hour
against
the
employer.
and
we
look
for
concrete
situation,
this
was
a
continuing
violation
and
we
were
waiting
until
we
had
a
tightly
concrete
situation.
now,
i
might
also
add
this
that
irrespective
of
the
question
of
even
what
happened
between
1966
and
68
which
frankly
i
think
is
a
question
of
fact
on
the
merits.
we
don't
have
all
the
merits
and
all
the
facts
before
us.
there
can
be
no
question
that
from
the
time
that
we
file
the
notice
of
arbitration
that
being
from
1968
until
the
conclusion
of
the
contract,
there
could
be
no
issue
with
delay.
it
might
be
frankly
that
an
arbitrator
might
take
the
position
that
because
we
waited
for
those
years,
there
might
not
be
any
remedial
thing
that
he
could
do
in
terms
of
back
pay.
but
obviously
that
would
have
to
come
out
in
terms
of
all
the
facts
in
this
case.
and
we
don't
have
all
the
facts
in
this
case
before
us,
and
that
really
creates
the
problem.
i
might
ask
the
chief
justice
if
i
could
reserve
five
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
bernard
m.
baum
mr.
chief
justice,
just
a
couple
of
comments
that
i
wish
to
address
to
the
court.
i
think
mr.
justice
rehnquist
was
correct,
when
he
noted
the
decision
of
the
district
court
at
page
149
of
the
abstract,
holding
that
there
was
a
contract
but
that
the
question
was
the
laches.
i
would
also
suggest
to
the
court
that
they
examine
page
93
of
the
abstract,
where
the
court
during
the
hearing,
specifically
stated
that
it
held
that
the
agreement
came
into
existence
and
held
that
there
was
an
agreement.
i
would
further
suggest
to
the
court
that
they
examine
page
156
of
the
abstract
being
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
this
case
in
which
they
say
their
issue
is
the
question
of
whether
a
party
to
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
which
contains
an
arbitration
clause
may
be
so
dilatory
in
making
the
existence
of
a
vaguely
delineated
disputes
known
to
the
other
party
that
the
court
is
justified
in
refusing
to
compel
the
submission.
the
point
is,
you
can't
get
to
the
issue
of
laches
unless
you
first
have
a
contract
because
why
would
you
want
to
reach
the
issue
of
laches
unless
you
first
have
a
contract.
if
you
have
no
binding
contract
there
is
no
issue
to
reach,
and
i
think
that
the
counsel
was
incorrect.
mr.
bernard
m.
baum
the
court
has
to
determine
whether
there
exists
an
agreement
obviously,
whether
the
parties
have
entered
into
a
written
agreement.
of
course,
they'd
probably
get
into
like
in
this
case.
we
have
an
entire
agreement
of
the
party's
clause
which
says
there
could
no
oral
agreements
or
understandings.
so
that
here,
the
written
agreement
is
the
binding
agreement
but
obviously
you
have
to
decide
that
question
but
you
can't
get
to
the
issue,
why
get
to
the
issue
of
the
laches
if
you
do
not
have
the
contract
in
the
first
place?
you
say
you
do
not
have
a
contract,
there
is
nothing
to
arbitrate.
mr.
bernard
m.
baum
well,
it
says
as
justice
rehnquist
referred,
accordingly,
i
have
determined
that
the
defendant
was
bound
by
the
memorandum
of
agreement
to
arbitrate
labor
disputes
who
can
limit
for
the
arbitration
clause.
and
then
he
says,
however
i
am
not
going
to
enforce
this
provision
because
i
believe
that
the
union
was
guilty
of
laches
here.
this
becomes
a
very
complicated
situation
because
moreover,
this
was
an
industrial
case,
this
is
a
construction
union
and
what
limited
facts
and
the
record
show
this
is
on
construction
sites,
several
sexes
are
major
issue
which
would
have
to
be
determined
in
this
case.
what
kind
of
relationship?
this
isn't
where
you
have
a
steward
everyday
in
a
plant.
this
is
construction,
there
is
several,
counties,
there
is
several
sites,
business
agents
are
going
around,
there
isn't
this
kind
of
a
situation
that
you
have
in
industrial
plant.
obviously,
an
arbitrator
is
going
to
determine
these
kinds
of
questions
because
that
was
one
of
the
issues
we
would
have
to
get
into.
if
the
court
in
fact
had
held
the
hearing
on
laches
here,
we'd
have
to
do
it
before
an
arbitrator.
and
obviously,
it
becomes
part
of
the
merits.
moreover,
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
one
final
thing.
the
counsel
says
that
the
tobacco
workers
case
says
that
there
are
different
kinds
of
laches.
i
would
suggest
and
i
think
that
reading
of
the
tobacco
workers
case
directly
says,
we
disagree
with
the
seventh
circuit.
we
think
they
say
the
flair
builders
case
as
far
as
the
fourth
circuit
is
concerned
is
wrong.
they
say
the
issue
should
have
been
for
the
arbitrator
and
not
for
the
court,
and
there
is
no
question.
they
don't
delineate
as
to
different
kinds
of
laches,
that
laches
is
delay,
its
waiver,
its
procedural
delay.
i
submit
that
there
is
no
difference,
and
i
submit
that
if
this
court
is
going
to
permit
these
kinds
of
issues
to
be
decided
by
the
courts
rather
than
the
arbitrators,
where
you
have
in
all
disputes
arbitration
clause
which
are
going
to
get
into
is
more
litigation
and
undermine
the
arbitration
process.
thank
you.
