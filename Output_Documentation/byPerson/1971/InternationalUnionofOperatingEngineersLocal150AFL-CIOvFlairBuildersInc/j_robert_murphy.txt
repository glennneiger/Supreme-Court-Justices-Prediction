mr.
j.
robert
murphy
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
to
the
court?
i
think
that
as
we
have
suggested
in
our
brief
on
this
appeal,
the
inclination
of
the
petitioner,
the
union
has
been
actually
to
define
the
issue
of
this
case
in
a
broader
sense
than
they
purport
to
be
defining
it.
it
is
true
that
we
would
differ
with
them
substantially
on
their
interpretation
of
the
activities
and
proceeding
in
the
court
below.
we
find
no
place
in
the
actual
proceedings
in
the
trial
court
where
the
union
was
in
any
way
prejudiced
or
surprised
by
what
happened.
but
in
their
brief
they
constantly
reiterate
that
the
trial
court
found
that
the
parties
were
bound
by
an
agreement
to
arbitrator.
the
trial
court
never
so
found
an
examination
of
each
of
one
of
the
orders
entered
by
the
trial
court,
whether
on
the
initial
motion
to
dismiss
against
the
original
complaint
which
by
the
way
was
not
seeking
arbitration
and
was
filed
by
the
union
for
in
a
completely
different
purpose
but
on
that
motion
order
on
that
motion
to
dismiss
the
amended
complaint,
and
on
the
final
order
of
the
trial
court
there
has
not
been
a
finding
of
fact
that
could
be
considered
final
and
binding
that
the
parties
were
ever
bound.
it
would
be
accurate
to
say
that
the
trial
court
indicated
that
there
was
an
agreement
signed,
yes.
but
whether
or
not
it
was
binding
at
the
time
of
the
action
was
the
threshold
question
which
had
to
be
determined
by
the
trial
court
and
which
was
determined
by
the
trial
court
on
the
facts
as
it
heard
it
adversely
to
the
union.
now,
on
a
narrower
approach
to
this
case,
we
would
think
that
this
would
be
adequate
and
fully
supported
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
wiley
against
livingston,
in
the
lincoln
mills
case,
the
steelworkers
trilogy,
and
the
entire
series
of
cases
which
have
set
up
the
distinction
between
those
matters
which
an
arbitrator
there
will
be
considered
to
have
jurisdiction
to
decide
and
those
matters
involving
the
threshold
question
which
the
trial
court
under
section
301
will
have
the
right
to
decide.
but
the
union
in
this
case
is
not
restricting
itself
to
this
narrow
issue.
it
seems
to
us
that
they
are
going
further
and
basically
asking,
under
the
case
of
limiting
their
argument
to
the
question
of
who
gets
to
decide
whether
laches
is
a
defense
but
they
are
going
further
and
suggesting
that
this
court
or
that
this
court
should
recommend
to
trial
courts
and
the
incidence
of
nine
--
of
301
cases
that
they
should
have
nothing
but
a
cursory
inquiry
into
whether
or
not
there
is
or
is
not
a
binding
contract.
mr.
j.
robert
murphy
i
would
agree
with
that
your
honor,
yes.
but
in
so,
agreeing
i
would
have
to
point
that
in
all
of
the
cases
from
the
lincoln
mills
through
the
steelworkers
and
so
on,
there
has
never
been
any
question
but
what
the
trial
court
in
301
cases
must
as
a
matter
of
judicial
responsibility
find
that
there
is
a
binding
agreement
before
it
can
order
arbitration.
now,
in
a
footnote
to
the
steelworkers
case
mr.
justice
douglas'
opinions
specifically
pointed
out
that
if
it
were
alleged
that
there
was
a
contract
which
in
effect
said
that
the
arbitrator
should
decide
his
own
jurisdiction
that
he
would
require
that
the
parties
so
alleging
have
the
burden
of
saying
that.
so
that
there
is
never
really
been
more
that
what
you
could
call
a
presumption
of
arbitrability
resulting
from
the
steelworkers
lines
of
cases
and
we
can
accept
that
presumption.
but
in
so
accepting
it,
your
honor,
we
do
not
mean
to
suggest
that
the
court
does
not
have
its
own
preliminary
and
primary
obligation.
mr.
j.
robert
murphy
i
would
have
to
admit
that
that
is
what
it
appears
to
be,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
robert
murphy
no,
we
are
not
your
honor.
mr.
j.
robert
murphy
no,
your
honor.
it
does
not
involve
the
interpretation
of
the
arbitration
clause
because
we
are
departing
for
--
mr.
j.
robert
murphy
it's
exactly
the
ongoing
binding
character
that
we
have
challenged
and
that
in
this
particular
case
--
mr.
j.
robert
murphy
we
see
that
as
the
issue
your
honor
and
we
have
seen
that
as
the
issue
from
the
first
time
that
we
file
the
pleading
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
robert
murphy
not
in
this
court,
your
honor,
we
don't
feel.
it
would
yes,
require
factual
determinations
in
the
trial
court.
but
we
can
see
very
little
difference
between
this
situation
and
a
situation
that
might
be
presented
if
the
parties
had
torn
up
the
contract.
mr.
j.
robert
murphy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
robert
murphy
if
that
were
the
issue
of
this
case,
your
honor?
i
would
concede
that
the
question
of
laches
in
that
instance
was
a
matter
for
the
arbitrator
and
i
don't
think
that
you
would
find
any
different
indication
in
the
opinions
below.
mr.
j.
robert
murphy
but
that
is
not
the
situation
in
this
case.
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
robert
murphy
when
he
went
into
the
trial
court
he
was
asking
for
many
thousand
dollars
damage
and
for
a
direction,
i
believe
that
the
employer
be
required
to
comply
with
the
contract
in
which
particular
manner
he
did
not
specify
and
it
was
only
in
the
amended
complaint
when
he
finally
suggested
that
arbitration
was
the
remedy
that
he
was
after.
mr.
j.
robert
murphy
yes,
we
will
your
honor.
mr.
j.
robert
murphy
yes,
it
was
your
honor.
mr.
j.
robert
murphy
oh!
i
suggest
that
it
is
a
part
of
the
total
controversy
but
it's
the
part
of
the
total
controversy
that
must
be
decided
by
the
court.
mr.
j.
robert
murphy
the
question
of
laches
in
this
particular
case
your
honor
goes
to
the
binding
force
of
the
contract,
and
i
cannot
concede
in
any
way
that
there
was
at
the
time
of
this
case
reach
the
courts
in
any
way,
a
binding
contract
because
under
the
circumstances
there
was
no
longer
a
binding
contract.
it
is
only
by
misinterpretation
of
the
facts
that
counsel
for
the
union
can
possibly
say
that
there
was
a
binding
contract
or
that
the
court
below
found
one.
mr.
j.
robert
murphy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
robert
murphy
i
would
have
to
say
that
that
clause
in
judge
decker's
opinion
was
a
part,
a
finding
of
fact
if
you
will
your
honor,
yes.
but
it
was
not
his
ultimate
holding.
he
was
not
seeing
that
i
hold
that
somebody
who
has
once
been
bound
is
no
longer
bound
except
that
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
just
wasn't
a
binding
contract
anymore.
he
may
have
used
the
words
and
he
did
use
the
words,
that
your
honor
has
quoted
that
is
correct.
may
i,
your
honor
just
make
one
additional
reflection
concerning
what
we
are
saying
here,
and,
that
is
that
while
it
would
possibly
have
been
permissible
to
take
the
contrary
approach
in
the
trial
court
and
to
say
that
since
there
once
was
a
contract
that
was
signed,
we
are
going
to
leave
everything
that
ever
happened
after
that
to
the
arbitrator.
it
seems
equally
clear
to
me
that
in
view
of
the
decision
of
this
court
in
boys
markets
that
that
approach
is
no
longer
permissible,
and
i
say
this
for
what
i
feel
are
important
policy
reasons.
in
the
boys
markets
case
it
was
being
the
relief
which
was
being
sought
was
basically
an
injunction
against
to
strike.
the
impression
that
this
court
gives
in
the
boys
market
opinion
is
that
where
an
anti-strike
injunction
is
being
sought,
the
function
of
the
trial
court
under
section
301
is
to
take
an
active
part
in
the
investigation
of
this
threshold
question
as
to
whether
there
is
or
is
not
a
binding
contract
and
a
binding
arbitration
plus
a
part
of
it,
and
it
would
seem
to
us
that
if
that
is
the
approach
to
be
taken
under
the
boys
markets
decision,
it
is
impossible
to
rationalize
a
lighter,
a
more
cursive
approach
in
a
case
where
it
is
not
being
as
where
an
injunction
is
not
being
sought
but
where
only
relief
that
is
being
sought
is
in
the
type
of
arbitration
that
is
being
sought
by
the
plaintiff's
amended
complaint
here.
we
can
see
no
reason
why
there
should
be
any
distinction
in
the
importance
that
the
trial
court
is
to
give
to
that
preliminary
investigation
of
the
threshold
question.
so,
it
would
be
our
feeling
that
as
a
result
of
the
boys
markets
decision
this
court
must
avoid
enunciating
a
double
standard
which
might
possibly
work
in
equity
between
the
parties.
if
there
is
to
be
one
standard
when
an
injunction
is
sought,
and
the
contrary,
and
less
stringent
standard
when
all
that
is
being
sought
is
arbitration,
it
seems
to
us
there
is
no
way
to
put
this
together
and
avoid
confusion
in
the
trial
courts
or
even
to
make
an
equitable
arrangement
between
the
parties.
what
if
both
types
of
relief
are
being
sought
in
the
same
proceeding,
and
after
all,
in
the
injunction
situation
which
you
are
directly
confronted
with
in
the
boys
markets
case,
we
are
ordered
--
the
trial
courts
are
ordered
to
direct
the
employer
to
arbitrate
at
the
same
time.
now,
in
those
situations,
there
we
can
make
one
standard
of
inquiry
and
to
whether
or
not
there
is
a
binding
contract,
and
then
later
in
the
same
case
make
a
different
standard
of
inquiry?
mr.
j.
robert
murphy
that
would
be
the
effect
of
the
decision
of
the
court
of
the
appeals?
mr.
j.
robert
murphy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
robert
murphy
yes.
mr.
j.
robert
murphy
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
robert
murphy
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
robert
murphy
right,
that
is
our
position
and
by
the
way
that
was
the
position
of
the
fourth
circuit
in
its
tobacco
workers
case
on
which
petitioner
relied.
they
made
a
specific
distinction
between
the
type
of
laches
that
would
go
to
the
matters
as
they
set
which
are
to
be
decided
by
the
court,
and
the
type
of
laches
which
go
to
the
matters
to
be
decided
by
the
arbitrator.
so
if
that
is
the
distinction
of
the
fourth
circuit
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief.
we
think
the
fourth
circuit
would
have
decided
this
particular
case
exactly
the
way
our
seventh
circuit
decided
it.
because
there
are
apparently
two
different
kinds
of
laches
as
your
honor
has
pointed
out,
one
which
goes
to
the
hardest
matter.
we
think
also
that
going
back
to
the
position
of
the
boys
markets
decision,
it
is
necessary
to
have
a
uniform
standard
of
inquiry
for
the
courts
to
avoid
the
rather
embarrassing
and
inequitable
situation
which
could
arise
where
there
are
matters
that
are
obviously
somewhat
outside
the
scope
of
arbitration
and
to
avoid
these
cases
where
the
arbitrators
decision
or
award
might
even
end
up
in
what
the
courts
would
consider
matters
of
illegality.
let
us
supposed
that
the
trial
court
has
order
arbitration
after
a
cursory
inquiry
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
binding
arbitration
clause
and
the
arbitrator
in
turn
decides
that
he
has
no
jurisdiction.
now
that
might
be
only
a
matter
of
slight
import
in
the
ordinary
case
but
if
you
are
in
the
case
where
you
are
also
asking
for
an
injunction
against
the
strike,
what
have
you
have
ended
up
with
is
giving
the
employer
and
anti-strike
injunction
and
not
giving
the
union,
the
arbitration
that
it
wants,
which
could
be
a
very
damaging
case
for
the
union
and
i
would
think
that
the
counsel
representing
that
union
would
almost
be
on
our
side,
and
this
interpretation
of
the
boys
markets
decision.
mr.
j.
robert
murphy
[laughter
attempt]
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
i
can
sum
up
my
position
and
i
hope
that
i
have
made
myself
clear
as
to
my
understanding
of
the
effect
of
the
decisions
below
by
saying
that
in
our
view
point
the
decisions
below
are
well
within
the
scope
of
the
prior
labor
law
of
this
court
has
fashioned
since
the
lincoln
mills
decision.
the
purpose
of
the
court
in
fashioning
this
labor
law
has
been
constantly
reiterated
by
saying
that
the
aim
is
to
promote
industrial
peace.
they
aim
yes
to
promote
industrial
peace
through
the
use
of
the
arbitration
process
as
a
central
institution
in
that
promotion
of
industrial
peace
but
never,
never
at
the
expense
of
saying
that
the
arbitration
process
is
self-operating.
it
won't
operate.
an
arbitrational
word
would
hardly
be
valid
or
worthwhile
if
it
could
not
be
enforced
by
the
court.
since
the
boys
markets
decision
it
seems
to
us
that
unless
this
court
is
to
suggest
to
the
trial
courts
that
they
should
vary
the
principle
according
to
the
remedy
that
is
being
sought.
it
is
necessary
to
require
of
the
trial
courts
in
any
case
under
section
301
that
the
court
take
an
active
position
in
arriving
at
the
decision
as
to
threshold
question.
it
must
actively
investigate
whether
there
is
a
binding
contract.
it
must
actively
investigate
whether
or
not
that
binding
contract
is
still
binding
at
the
time
of
the
incidence
in
the
court
and
actively
investigate
the
scope
of
the
arbitration
clause.
if
there
is
no
active
investigation,
there
will
be
contradictory
opinions,
there
will
be
confusion
in
the
trial
courts.
we
will
have
achieved
one
thing
that
the
boys
markets
desired
of
the
opinion
and
the
boys
market
seemed
to
have
desired
and
that
was
to
reinforced
the
remaining
use
of
state
courts
in
section
301
cases,
and
it
would
be
that
possible
reinforcement
from
a
uniform
standard
which
we
are
suggesting,
that
would
be
our
answer
to
the
suggestion
that
perhaps
were
giving
the
federal
courts
too
much
to
do
that
we're
adding
to
their
workload.
we
feel
that
if
a
uniform
standard
is
to
be
promoted
by
the
decision
in
the
case
before
the
bar
today
that
that
uniform
standard
will
reinforce
the
availability
of
the
conventional
state
court
remedies
as
was
said
in
the
boys
market,
peace
that
should
be
reinforced
so
that
those
state
court
remedies
which
the
congress
apparently
desired
to
keep
available
will
be
available.
mr.
j.
robert
murphy
yes,
it
is
aimed
at
this,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
robert
murphy
looking
at
the
facts
of
this
case,
your
honor,
the
speedy
solution
of
arbitration
was
available
to
this
union
five
years
before
it
first
suggested
that
speedy
solution.
there
was
not
an
on-going
employer-union
relationship
which
ought
to
be
the
minimum
condition
for
the
effective
collective
bargaining
and
the
arbitration
which
is
the
part
of
it.
this
situation
was
one
where
there
was
no
relationship
between
these
parties.
and
if
we
consider
that
as
a
part
of
the
facts
which
have
obviously
was
on
the
proofs
of
both
parties
in
the
trial
court,
it
would
be
impossible
to
say
that
to
order
arbitration
in
this
matter
when
they
are
finally
asked
for
it,
would
have
contributed
in
anyway
to
industrial
peace.
that
is
the
reason
we
have
suggested
in
our
brief
that
a
part
of
speedy
resolution
of
dispute
should
certainly
be
the
availability
of
the
judicial
part
of
the
relief.
but
it
would
hardly
been
up
to
the
employer
to
go
and
suggest
it
when
they
had
no
union
on
the
horizon
for
a
period
of
five
years
after
the
memorandum
of
agreement
was
signed.
i
hope
i
am
not
going
around
the
periphery
of
your
honors'
question
but
i
am
trying
to
say
that
well,
everyone
realizes
and
hopes
that
arbitration
will
continue
as
an
effective
part
of
the
collective
bargaining
process
that
in
some
cases
and
this
one
is
an
unusual
and
we
would
have
to
concede
in
some
cases
arbitration
will
not
contribute
to
that
in
the
ordering
of
arbitration
in
some
cases
as
was
pointed
out
in
wiley
against
livingston
would
be
imposing
upon
the
parties
something
which
they
have
not
agreed
to.
mr.
j.
robert
murphy
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
to
the
court?
i
think
that
as
we
have
suggested
in
our
brief
on
this
appeal,
the
inclination
of
the
petitioner,
the
union
has
been
actually
to
define
the
issue
of
this
case
in
a
broader
sense
than
they
purport
to
be
defining
it.
it
is
true
that
we
would
differ
with
them
substantially
on
their
interpretation
of
the
activities
and
proceeding
in
the
court
below.
we
find
no
place
in
the
actual
proceedings
in
the
trial
court
where
the
union
was
in
any
way
prejudiced
or
surprised
by
what
happened.
but
in
their
brief
they
constantly
reiterate
that
the
trial
court
found
that
the
parties
were
bound
by
an
agreement
to
arbitrator.
the
trial
court
never
so
found
an
examination
of
each
of
one
of
the
orders
entered
by
the
trial
court,
whether
on
the
initial
motion
to
dismiss
against
the
original
complaint
which
by
the
way
was
not
seeking
arbitration
and
was
filed
by
the
union
for
in
a
completely
different
purpose
but
on
that
motion
order
on
that
motion
to
dismiss
the
amended
complaint,
and
on
the
final
order
of
the
trial
court
there
has
not
been
a
finding
of
fact
that
could
be
considered
final
and
binding
that
the
parties
were
ever
bound.
it
would
be
accurate
to
say
that
the
trial
court
indicated
that
there
was
an
agreement
signed,
yes.
but
whether
or
not
it
was
binding
at
the
time
of
the
action
was
the
threshold
question
which
had
to
be
determined
by
the
trial
court
and
which
was
determined
by
the
trial
court
on
the
facts
as
it
heard
it
adversely
to
the
union.
now,
on
a
narrower
approach
to
this
case,
we
would
think
that
this
would
be
adequate
and
fully
supported
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
wiley
against
livingston,
in
the
lincoln
mills
case,
the
steelworkers
trilogy,
and
the
entire
series
of
cases
which
have
set
up
the
distinction
between
those
matters
which
an
arbitrator
there
will
be
considered
to
have
jurisdiction
to
decide
and
those
matters
involving
the
threshold
question
which
the
trial
court
under
section
301
will
have
the
right
to
decide.
but
the
union
in
this
case
is
not
restricting
itself
to
this
narrow
issue.
it
seems
to
us
that
they
are
going
further
and
basically
asking,
under
the
case
of
limiting
their
argument
to
the
question
of
who
gets
to
decide
whether
laches
is
a
defense
but
they
are
going
further
and
suggesting
that
this
court
or
that
this
court
should
recommend
to
trial
courts
and
the
incidence
of
nine
--
of
301
cases
that
they
should
have
nothing
but
a
cursory
inquiry
into
whether
or
not
there
is
or
is
not
a
binding
contract.
mr.
j.
robert
murphy
i
would
agree
with
that
your
honor,
yes.
but
in
so,
agreeing
i
would
have
to
point
that
in
all
of
the
cases
from
the
lincoln
mills
through
the
steelworkers
and
so
on,
there
has
never
been
any
question
but
what
the
trial
court
in
301
cases
must
as
a
matter
of
judicial
responsibility
find
that
there
is
a
binding
agreement
before
it
can
order
arbitration.
now,
in
a
footnote
to
the
steelworkers
case
mr.
justice
douglas'
opinions
specifically
pointed
out
that
if
it
were
alleged
that
there
was
a
contract
which
in
effect
said
that
the
arbitrator
should
decide
his
own
jurisdiction
that
he
would
require
that
the
parties
so
alleging
have
the
burden
of
saying
that.
so
that
there
is
never
really
been
more
that
what
you
could
call
a
presumption
of
arbitrability
resulting
from
the
steelworkers
lines
of
cases
and
we
can
accept
that
presumption.
but
in
so
accepting
it,
your
honor,
we
do
not
mean
to
suggest
that
the
court
does
not
have
its
own
preliminary
and
primary
obligation.
mr.
j.
robert
murphy
i
would
have
to
admit
that
that
is
what
it
appears
to
be,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
robert
murphy
no,
we
are
not
your
honor.
mr.
j.
robert
murphy
no,
your
honor.
it
does
not
involve
the
interpretation
of
the
arbitration
clause
because
we
are
departing
for
--
mr.
j.
robert
murphy
it's
exactly
the
ongoing
binding
character
that
we
have
challenged
and
that
in
this
particular
case
--
mr.
j.
robert
murphy
we
see
that
as
the
issue
your
honor
and
we
have
seen
that
as
the
issue
from
the
first
time
that
we
file
the
pleading
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
robert
murphy
not
in
this
court,
your
honor,
we
don't
feel.
it
would
yes,
require
factual
determinations
in
the
trial
court.
but
we
can
see
very
little
difference
between
this
situation
and
a
situation
that
might
be
presented
if
the
parties
had
torn
up
the
contract.
mr.
j.
robert
murphy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
robert
murphy
if
that
were
the
issue
of
this
case,
your
honor?
i
would
concede
that
the
question
of
laches
in
that
instance
was
a
matter
for
the
arbitrator
and
i
don't
think
that
you
would
find
any
different
indication
in
the
opinions
below.
mr.
j.
robert
murphy
but
that
is
not
the
situation
in
this
case.
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
robert
murphy
when
he
went
into
the
trial
court
he
was
asking
for
many
thousand
dollars
damage
and
for
a
direction,
i
believe
that
the
employer
be
required
to
comply
with
the
contract
in
which
particular
manner
he
did
not
specify
and
it
was
only
in
the
amended
complaint
when
he
finally
suggested
that
arbitration
was
the
remedy
that
he
was
after.
mr.
j.
robert
murphy
yes,
we
will
your
honor.
mr.
j.
robert
murphy
yes,
it
was
your
honor.
mr.
j.
robert
murphy
oh!
i
suggest
that
it
is
a
part
of
the
total
controversy
but
it's
the
part
of
the
total
controversy
that
must
be
decided
by
the
court.
mr.
j.
robert
murphy
the
question
of
laches
in
this
particular
case
your
honor
goes
to
the
binding
force
of
the
contract,
and
i
cannot
concede
in
any
way
that
there
was
at
the
time
of
this
case
reach
the
courts
in
any
way,
a
binding
contract
because
under
the
circumstances
there
was
no
longer
a
binding
contract.
it
is
only
by
misinterpretation
of
the
facts
that
counsel
for
the
union
can
possibly
say
that
there
was
a
binding
contract
or
that
the
court
below
found
one.
mr.
j.
robert
murphy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
robert
murphy
i
would
have
to
say
that
that
clause
in
judge
decker's
opinion
was
a
part,
a
finding
of
fact
if
you
will
your
honor,
yes.
but
it
was
not
his
ultimate
holding.
he
was
not
seeing
that
i
hold
that
somebody
who
has
once
been
bound
is
no
longer
bound
except
that
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
just
wasn't
a
binding
contract
anymore.
he
may
have
used
the
words
and
he
did
use
the
words,
that
your
honor
has
quoted
that
is
correct.
may
i,
your
honor
just
make
one
additional
reflection
concerning
what
we
are
saying
here,
and,
that
is
that
while
it
would
possibly
have
been
permissible
to
take
the
contrary
approach
in
the
trial
court
and
to
say
that
since
there
once
was
a
contract
that
was
signed,
we
are
going
to
leave
everything
that
ever
happened
after
that
to
the
arbitrator.
it
seems
equally
clear
to
me
that
in
view
of
the
decision
of
this
court
in
boys
markets
that
that
approach
is
no
longer
permissible,
and
i
say
this
for
what
i
feel
are
important
policy
reasons.
in
the
boys
markets
case
it
was
being
the
relief
which
was
being
sought
was
basically
an
injunction
against
to
strike.
the
impression
that
this
court
gives
in
the
boys
market
opinion
is
that
where
an
anti-strike
injunction
is
being
sought,
the
function
of
the
trial
court
under
section
301
is
to
take
an
active
part
in
the
investigation
of
this
threshold
question
as
to
whether
there
is
or
is
not
a
binding
contract
and
a
binding
arbitration
plus
a
part
of
it,
and
it
would
seem
to
us
that
if
that
is
the
approach
to
be
taken
under
the
boys
markets
decision,
it
is
impossible
to
rationalize
a
lighter,
a
more
cursive
approach
in
a
case
where
it
is
not
being
as
where
an
injunction
is
not
being
sought
but
where
only
relief
that
is
being
sought
is
in
the
type
of
arbitration
that
is
being
sought
by
the
plaintiff's
amended
complaint
here.
we
can
see
no
reason
why
there
should
be
any
distinction
in
the
importance
that
the
trial
court
is
to
give
to
that
preliminary
investigation
of
the
threshold
question.
so,
it
would
be
our
feeling
that
as
a
result
of
the
boys
markets
decision
this
court
must
avoid
enunciating
a
double
standard
which
might
possibly
work
in
equity
between
the
parties.
if
there
is
to
be
one
standard
when
an
injunction
is
sought,
and
the
contrary,
and
less
stringent
standard
when
all
that
is
being
sought
is
arbitration,
it
seems
to
us
there
is
no
way
to
put
this
together
and
avoid
confusion
in
the
trial
courts
or
even
to
make
an
equitable
arrangement
between
the
parties.
what
if
both
types
of
relief
are
being
sought
in
the
same
proceeding,
and
after
all,
in
the
injunction
situation
which
you
are
directly
confronted
with
in
the
boys
markets
case,
we
are
ordered
--
the
trial
courts
are
ordered
to
direct
the
employer
to
arbitrate
at
the
same
time.
now,
in
those
situations,
there
we
can
make
one
standard
of
inquiry
and
to
whether
or
not
there
is
a
binding
contract,
and
then
later
in
the
same
case
make
a
different
standard
of
inquiry?
mr.
j.
robert
murphy
that
would
be
the
effect
of
the
decision
of
the
court
of
the
appeals?
mr.
j.
robert
murphy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
robert
murphy
yes.
mr.
j.
robert
murphy
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
robert
murphy
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
robert
murphy
right,
that
is
our
position
and
by
the
way
that
was
the
position
of
the
fourth
circuit
in
its
tobacco
workers
case
on
which
petitioner
relied.
they
made
a
specific
distinction
between
the
type
of
laches
that
would
go
to
the
matters
as
they
set
which
are
to
be
decided
by
the
court,
and
the
type
of
laches
which
go
to
the
matters
to
be
decided
by
the
arbitrator.
so
if
that
is
the
distinction
of
the
fourth
circuit
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief.
we
think
the
fourth
circuit
would
have
decided
this
particular
case
exactly
the
way
our
seventh
circuit
decided
it.
because
there
are
apparently
two
different
kinds
of
laches
as
your
honor
has
pointed
out,
one
which
goes
to
the
hardest
matter.
we
think
also
that
going
back
to
the
position
of
the
boys
markets
decision,
it
is
necessary
to
have
a
uniform
standard
of
inquiry
for
the
courts
to
avoid
the
rather
embarrassing
and
inequitable
situation
which
could
arise
where
there
are
matters
that
are
obviously
somewhat
outside
the
scope
of
arbitration
and
to
avoid
these
cases
where
the
arbitrators
decision
or
award
might
even
end
up
in
what
the
courts
would
consider
matters
of
illegality.
let
us
supposed
that
the
trial
court
has
order
arbitration
after
a
cursory
inquiry
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
binding
arbitration
clause
and
the
arbitrator
in
turn
decides
that
he
has
no
jurisdiction.
now
that
might
be
only
a
matter
of
slight
import
in
the
ordinary
case
but
if
you
are
in
the
case
where
you
are
also
asking
for
an
injunction
against
the
strike,
what
have
you
have
ended
up
with
is
giving
the
employer
and
anti-strike
injunction
and
not
giving
the
union,
the
arbitration
that
it
wants,
which
could
be
a
very
damaging
case
for
the
union
and
i
would
think
that
the
counsel
representing
that
union
would
almost
be
on
our
side,
and
this
interpretation
of
the
boys
markets
decision.
mr.
j.
robert
murphy
[laughter
attempt]
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
i
can
sum
up
my
position
and
i
hope
that
i
have
made
myself
clear
as
to
my
understanding
of
the
effect
of
the
decisions
below
by
saying
that
in
our
view
point
the
decisions
below
are
well
within
the
scope
of
the
prior
labor
law
of
this
court
has
fashioned
since
the
lincoln
mills
decision.
the
purpose
of
the
court
in
fashioning
this
labor
law
has
been
constantly
reiterated
by
saying
that
the
aim
is
to
promote
industrial
peace.
they
aim
yes
to
promote
industrial
peace
through
the
use
of
the
arbitration
process
as
a
central
institution
in
that
promotion
of
industrial
peace
but
never,
never
at
the
expense
of
saying
that
the
arbitration
process
is
self-operating.
it
won't
operate.
an
arbitrational
word
would
hardly
be
valid
or
worthwhile
if
it
could
not
be
enforced
by
the
court.
since
the
boys
markets
decision
it
seems
to
us
that
unless
this
court
is
to
suggest
to
the
trial
courts
that
they
should
vary
the
principle
according
to
the
remedy
that
is
being
sought.
it
is
necessary
to
require
of
the
trial
courts
in
any
case
under
section
301
that
the
court
take
an
active
position
in
arriving
at
the
decision
as
to
threshold
question.
it
must
actively
investigate
whether
there
is
a
binding
contract.
it
must
actively
investigate
whether
or
not
that
binding
contract
is
still
binding
at
the
time
of
the
incidence
in
the
court
and
actively
investigate
the
scope
of
the
arbitration
clause.
if
there
is
no
active
investigation,
there
will
be
contradictory
opinions,
there
will
be
confusion
in
the
trial
courts.
we
will
have
achieved
one
thing
that
the
boys
markets
desired
of
the
opinion
and
the
boys
market
seemed
to
have
desired
and
that
was
to
reinforced
the
remaining
use
of
state
courts
in
section
301
cases,
and
it
would
be
that
possible
reinforcement
from
a
uniform
standard
which
we
are
suggesting,
that
would
be
our
answer
to
the
suggestion
that
perhaps
were
giving
the
federal
courts
too
much
to
do
that
we're
adding
to
their
workload.
we
feel
that
if
a
uniform
standard
is
to
be
promoted
by
the
decision
in
the
case
before
the
bar
today
that
that
uniform
standard
will
reinforce
the
availability
of
the
conventional
state
court
remedies
as
was
said
in
the
boys
market,
peace
that
should
be
reinforced
so
that
those
state
court
remedies
which
the
congress
apparently
desired
to
keep
available
will
be
available.
mr.
j.
robert
murphy
yes,
it
is
aimed
at
this,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
robert
murphy
looking
at
the
facts
of
this
case,
your
honor,
the
speedy
solution
of
arbitration
was
available
to
this
union
five
years
before
it
first
suggested
that
speedy
solution.
there
was
not
an
on-going
employer-union
relationship
which
ought
to
be
the
minimum
condition
for
the
effective
collective
bargaining
and
the
arbitration
which
is
the
part
of
it.
this
situation
was
one
where
there
was
no
relationship
between
these
parties.
and
if
we
consider
that
as
a
part
of
the
facts
which
have
obviously
was
on
the
proofs
of
both
parties
in
the
trial
court,
it
would
be
impossible
to
say
that
to
order
arbitration
in
this
matter
when
they
are
finally
asked
for
it,
would
have
contributed
in
anyway
to
industrial
peace.
that
is
the
reason
we
have
suggested
in
our
brief
that
a
part
of
speedy
resolution
of
dispute
should
certainly
be
the
availability
of
the
judicial
part
of
the
relief.
but
it
would
hardly
been
up
to
the
employer
to
go
and
suggest
it
when
they
had
no
union
on
the
horizon
for
a
period
of
five
years
after
the
memorandum
of
agreement
was
signed.
i
hope
i
am
not
going
around
the
periphery
of
your
honors'
question
but
i
am
trying
to
say
that
well,
everyone
realizes
and
hopes
that
arbitration
will
continue
as
an
effective
part
of
the
collective
bargaining
process
that
in
some
cases
and
this
one
is
an
unusual
and
we
would
have
to
concede
in
some
cases
arbitration
will
not
contribute
to
that
in
the
ordering
of
arbitration
in
some
cases
as
was
pointed
out
in
wiley
against
livingston
would
be
imposing
upon
the
parties
something
which
they
have
not
agreed
to.
