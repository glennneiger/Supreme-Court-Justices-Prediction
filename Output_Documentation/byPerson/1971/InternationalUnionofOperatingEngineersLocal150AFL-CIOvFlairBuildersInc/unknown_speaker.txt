unknown
speaker
this
involved
one
employee,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
one
position?
unknown
speaker
one
position.
unknown
speaker
mr.
baum,
as
i
read
your
petition,
the
only
question
you
present
is
the
issue
of
whether
the
question
of
laches
is
one
for
the
court,
or
one
for
the
arbitrator,
are
you
going
beyond
that?
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
mr.
baum
that
concept
of
laches
might
be
different
in
the
context
of
a
labor
contract
in
labor
dispute
than
in
the
law
of
equity
generally?
unknown
speaker
mr.
baum,
i
understand
that
the
first
breach
is
alleged
to
have
occurred
in
1966
that
has
granted
the
union
to
wait
three
years
before
commencing
the
arbitration
proceedings.
unknown
speaker
now,
let's
--
assuming
that
the
parties
were
bound
by
collective
bargaining
contract
and
that
it
did
have
an
arbitration
clause
in
it
and
that's
the
way
the
case
comes
to
us
and
it
seems
to
me
the
arbitration
clause
here
was
in
all
disputes
clause,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
so
we're
not
dealing
with
an
arbitration
clause
that
limits
the
arbitrator
to
the
interpretation
in
the
application
of
the
--
unknown
speaker
and
what
you're
saying
is
that
in
this
specific
case,
the
parties,
the
employer
didn't
have
to
arbitrate
because
of
laches.
it
wasn't
that
assuming
there
was
about
collective
bargaining
contract
it
wasn't
that
something
had
happened
to
terminate
the
contract,
or
the
general
application
of
the
arbitration
clause?
unknown
speaker
or
its
on-going
binding
character.
it's
just
in
this
particular
dispute?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
isn't
an
issue
in
this
court.
is
it
whether
the
contract
as
a
whole
and
the
arbitration
clause
is
finding
on
the
employer?
that's
not
the
issue
here,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
are
perhaps
entitled
to
support
the
judgment
on
any
ground
that's
available
to
you
but
that
would
require
some
factual
determinations
here
in
this
court.
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
just
for
the
moment,
narrow
this
matter
down.
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
there
is
no
dispute,
whatsoever,
that
both
parties
had
signed
and
we're
bound
by
the
contract.
and
that
the
arbitration
clause
in
the
contract
was
in
all
disputes
clause.
now,
let's
start
from
that
premise
for
a
little
while.
unknown
speaker
now,
how
about
laches?
when
in
a
specific
case,
the
claim
is
that
the
arbitration
clause
is
inoperative
because
the
union
has
been
guilty
of
laches
and
it's
in
all
disputes
for
us.
now,
here
is
the
dispute
between
the
parties
as
to
whether
not
the
arbitration
clause
covers
this
dispute.
now,
that's
the
narrow
issue
in
the
case
at
least
just
one
of
them.
unknown
speaker
mr.
murphy.
unknown
speaker
well
is
your
--
is
your
point,
your
point
must
be
that
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
decision
on
laches
was
that
laches
and
delay
had
terminated
the
entire
contract.
it
just
doesn't
that
there
had
been
too
much
delay
in
this
case
to
force
arbitration?
there
was
no
longer
a
binding
contract
of
any
kind.
unknown
speaker
is
that
your
--
but
is
that
your
position?
unknown
speaker
whereas
if,
you
a
while
ago
conceded
that
if
it
were
only
a
question
of
laches
and
the
applicability
of
the
arbitration
clause
in
this
specific
instance
conceding
with
the
contract
in
the
arbitration
clause
continue
generally?
unknown
speaker
you
conceded
that
then
laches
would
be
a
question
for
the
arbitrator
under
and
all
disputes
clause.
unknown
speaker
but
where
laches,
you
say,
as
the
court
of
appeals
views
it
went
to
the
validity
and
the
existence
of
the
entire
contract.
unknown
speaker
that
then
laches
has
to
be
for
the
court.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
he
saw
the
case
the
way
you
do,
i
am
sure
he
would
be.
unknown
speaker
mr.
murphy,
you
certainly
stated
correctly
that
the
objective
of
the
arbitration
clauses
is
to
promote
industrial
peace.
that's
the
objective
though
isn't
it
and
is
not
the
means,
the
function
of
an
arbitration
clause
to
provide
a
simple
on
the
speedy
solution?
unknown
speaker
what
would
you
say
if
the
claim
made
by
an
employer
and
resisting
arbitration
was
that
we
have
orally
resented
the
contract?
there
is
no
contract,
no
arbitration
clause
anymore.
wouldn't
the
court
have
to
determine
as
a
threshold
question
whether
there
is
a
contract
and
an
arbitration
clause?
unknown
speaker
this
involved
one
employee,
isn't
it?
