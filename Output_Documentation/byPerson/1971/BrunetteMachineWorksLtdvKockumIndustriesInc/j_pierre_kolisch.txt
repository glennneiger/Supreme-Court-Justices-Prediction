mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
presented
for
review
is
which
of
two
federal
venue
statute
control
in
a
patent
infringement
suit.
one
of
them,
1391
(d)
is
a
venue
statute
which
controls
venue
generally
and
it
states
that
an
alien
maybe
sued
in
any
district.
the
other
statute,
1400
(b)
specifically
covers
the
situation
in
patent
infringement
action
and
it
provides
that
infringement
action
may
be
brought
in
the
district
where
the
defendant
resides,
or
where
the
defendants
has
committed
acts
of
infringement
and
has
regular
and
established
place
of
business.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
yes.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
it
is
not
--
it's
in
the
regular
established
place
of
business.
however,
in
the
particular
case
which
the
court
now
has
before
it,
that
is
not
important.
the
thing
that
is
significant
here
is,
what
was
the
history
of
the
special
venue
statute?
now,
this
court
has
passed
on
the
special
venue
statute
which
is
now
known
as
1400
(b),
three
times.
there
had
been
three
different
occasions
in
which
the
court
was
asked
to
expand
venue
in
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
it
--
it
is
not
important
in
this
case
because
there
isn't
any
question
that
under
the
special
venue
statute,
the
defendant
here
is
clear.
in
other
words,
if
the
special
venue
statute
controls,
there
is
no
venue.
if
the
general
venue
statute
controls,
there
is
venue.
so
it's
just
the
question
of
may
an
alien
--
you
see,
we
represent
a
canadian
defendant.
and
if
the
question
of
whether
an
alien
maybe
sued
any
place
under
the
general
venue
statute
or
may
the
defendant
claim
the
special
venue
statute.
now,
there
isn't
--
there
is
no
argument
that
we
do
not,
the
defendant,
does
not
qualify
under
the
special
venue
statute.
so
we
have
a
situation
here
which
controls
general
venue
or
special
venue.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
if
my
position
is
correct,
we
are
not
subject
to
suit.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
correct.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
i
thought
you
asked
me,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
whether
or
not
if
we
had
a
regular
and
established
place
of
business
and
whether
or
not
we
had
committed
acts
of
infringement
here.
more
important,
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
we
have
agreed
that
we
do
not
have
a
regular
and
established
place
of
business
and
we
have
not
committed
acts
of
infringement.
in
other
words,
if
special
venue
controls,
we're
not
covered,
were
out.
if
general
venue
controls,
we
are
because
we
are
an
alien.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
it
is
possible
at
--
in
certain
limited
situation
and
we're
willing
to
assume
it
for
the
purposes
of
this
case.
there
maybe
a
certain
class
of
defendants
in
infringement
cases
who
are
not
subject
to
an
infringement
suit
in
the
united
states.
you've
said
--
you've
said
it
completely
correctly,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
we
have
to
go
back
and
take
a
look
at
the
history
of
the
special
venue
statute
which
was
first
passed
in
1897
and
see
what
happened
and
what
this
court
did
with
respect
to
the
statute.
now,
the
court
held
in
the
three
prior
cases
that
the
special
venue
statute
controlled
as
to
all
defendants
and
i
emphasize
the
word
“all”
because
it
was
emphasized
by
the
court.
it
made
no
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
correct.
this
is
the
factual
difference
between
the
present
case
and
all
the
other
cases
which
the
court
has
considered,
namely
we
were
--
the
court
was
dealing
with
domestic
defendants.
now,
the
principle
which
we
say
that
governs
those
cases
is
still
the
same.
in
other
words,
it
is
our
position
that
the
act
of
1897
which
is
the
predecessor
of
1400
(b)
and
this
is
the
particular
statute
you
have
before
you.
in
that
act,
the
congress
very
clearly
un
--
unequivocally
as
this
court
has
stated
said,
that
special
venue
is
going
to
control
with
respect
to
all
defendants
irregardless
of
whether
or
not
they
are
domestic
or
alien.
now,
the
basic
facts
in
the
present
case
is
that
the
--
the
defendant,
brunette,
is
a
canadian
corporation
that
was
sued
in
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
oregon
for
infringement
of
two
patents,
brunette
is
not
a
resident
of
oregon
and
it
doesn't
have
a
regular
and
established
place
of
business
there.
the
brunette
motion
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
jurisdiction
obtained
under
a
--
there's
a
law
on
oregon
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
--
statute.
so
that
--
that
there
isn't
any
quarrel
about
jurisdiction.
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
granted.
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
based
on
a
decision
which
had
previously
been
handed
down
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
which
is
known
as
the
pfizer
case.
the
ninth
circuit
expressly
declined
to
follow
a
prior
decision
by
the
seventh
circuit
in
the
coulter
case
in
which
basically
the
same
factual
situation
had
been
presented,
namely
an
alien
defendant
claiming
improper
venue.
the
seventh
circuit
had
examined
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court,
came
to
the
conclusion
that
venue
was
improper
and
i
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
yes.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
and
--
and
judge
mansfield
refused
to
follow
and
expressly
mentioned
it.
and
our
position
is
now
that
the
problem
with
the
whole
line
of
cases,
and
there
had
been
district
court
cases
which
have
followed
pfizer
but
are
based
on
an
erroneous
line
of
district
court
cases.
and
it
is
our
position
that
these
cases
failed
to
appreciate
what
happened
in
1897
when
congress
passed
the
first
special
venue
statute.
now,
at
that
time,
the
court
--
this
court
had
already
decided
two
cases
involving
alien
defendants.
the
first
case
was
the
hohorst
case
in
1893.
and
that
case
involved
a
german
alien
in
a
patent
infringement
case,
and
the
court
said,
“alien
is
subject
to
suit
any
place”.
subsequently,
in
1895,
keasbey
&
mattison
came
along,
decided
by
this
court
and
keasbey
&
mattison
confirmed
hohorst,
an
alien
as
well
as
a
domestic.
keasbey
&
mattison
was
not
an
alien
case.
but
both
these
cases
stood
for
the
proposition
that
a
defendant
in
a
patent
infringement
case,
you
can
sue
in
any
place
you
can
get
service
on.
so,
the
act
of
1897
was
then
passed.
it
is
our
position
that
it
overruled
those
cases
because
congress,
when
it
passed
1897
act,
was
well
aware
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
hohorst
and
keasbey
&
mattison
for
that
which
they
stood.
and
now,
mind
you,
hohorost
did
stand
for
the
proposition
that
an
alien
could
be
sued
any
place.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
if
you
are
referring
to
the
legislative
history
with
respect
to
the
1948
of
the
1897
act
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
the
1897,
there
is
a
legislative
history
and
it's
set
forth
rather
fully
in
this
court's
opinion
in
stonite
which
is
the
first
case,
this
was
decided
in
1942.
there
were
footnote
in
stonite
and
they
go
a
little
rather
fully,
what
was
going
on
at
the
time
that
the
1897
act
was
passed
and
it
is
the
consensus
that
the
1897
act
was
passed
to
take
care
of
abuses
which
had
grown
in
patent
infringement
cases.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
the
history
does
not
indicate
any
specific
reference
to
hohorst
or
keasbey.
but
in
the
stonite
case,
the
court
does
discuss
hohorst
and
keasbey,
recognizes
the
situation
with
respect
to
hohorst
and
keasbey.
and
then
goes
on
to
say
that,
“we
decide
that
the
special
venue
statute
is
the
only
statute
controlling,”
and
it
excluded
everything
before
it.
now,
i
admit,
stonite
was
still
a
--
an
--
a
domestic
defendant.
there
was
not
an
alien
defendant
in
hohorst.
however,
in
the
stonite
decision
which
goes
into
the
history
rather
fully,
hohorst,
keasbey
and
all
the
other
cases
and
the
lower
court
cases
in
the
confusion
that
existed
among
the
lower
courts
with
respect
to
this
question
of
venue
in
patent
infringement,
is
examined
and
the
courts
says,
“congress
passed
the
1897
act
to
set
the
record
straight
and
make
it
clear
that
special
venue
controlled
in
all
infringement
cases”.
now,
the
next
time
that
the
court
had
the
question
before
it
was
in
the
fourco
case
in
1957.
now,
the
specific
question
presented
to
the
court
in
fourco
was
whether
1391
(c)
which
provided
that
a
corporation
can
be
sued
in
any
judicial
district
in
which
it
is
doing
business
was
supplem
--
was
supplementary
to
1400
(b).
now,
at
the
time
that
the
court
decided
fourco,
1957,
the
1948
revision
to
the
judicial
code
had
taken
place
and
it
was
at
that
time
that
the
subsessions
which
we
are
considering
and
specifically
1391
(d)
were
added
to
the
law.
now,
the
--
the
approach
which
the
court
took
in
fourco
was,
the
holding
in
stonite
that
the
special
venue
statute
controls
and
is
exclusive
is
still
good
law
unless
there
was
some
change
in
the
1948
revision
to
the
judicial
code.
again
i
say
that's
when
section
(c)
and
(d)
were
added.
the
court
was
specifically
considering
(c)
in
stonite.
the
court
came
to
the
conclusion
and
it
again
reviewed
the
history
of
the
1948
revision
and
what
had
happened
before
that
there
had
been
no
intended
change
in
the
law
and
that
therefore,
1400
(b)
remain
controlling
as
to
all
defendants
in
patent
infringement
cases,
and
that
1391
(c)
should
not
be
read
as
supplementary
to
1400
(b).
the
last
time
that
this
court
had
the
question
before
it
was
in
1961
and
that
was
in
schnell
case.
again,
the
court
briefly
reviewed
the
history,
came
to
the
conclusion
as
it
had
in
the
other
two
cases.
it
reaffirmed
its
decisions
in
stonite
and
fourco,
namely
that
1400
(b)
is
the
exclusive
provision
controlling
venue
in
patent
infringement.
and
the
court
specifically
said
in
schnell
that
the
attempts
to
broaden
patent
venue
were
contrary
--
contrary
to
the
congressional
intent.
and
as
far
as
the
court
was
concerned,
would
involve
judicial
legislation.now,
this
point
was
well
understood
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
in
terms
of
alien,
it
does
not.
it
quotes
from
what
mr.
mitchell
had
to
say.
however,
you
will
note
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
hohorst
is
discussed
in
the
footnote
of
stonite.
stonite
of
course
dealt
with
the
domestic,
but
hohorst
was
recognized
at
the
time
that
the
--
the
court
was
running
its
opinion
as
it
was
in
1897
when
the
act
was
passed.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
no.
mr.
mitchell
does
not
talk
about
hohorst.
however,
the
court
when
it
wrote
stonite,
had
hohorst
in
mind.
now,
it's
our
position
that
an
alien
just
like
a
domestic
defendant
who's
involved
in
a
patent
case,
that
this
doesn't
justify
a
change
in
the
interpretation
of
the
law
which
this
court
has
had
for
the
last
75
years.
now,
the
principle
argument
which
is
urged
on
this
court
and
which
apparently
carried
the
day
before
judge
mansfield
was
that
the
revisers
note
to
1391
(d)
--
and
it
emphasized
that
in
the
fourco
case,
1400
(b)
had
not
--
that
the
--
that
this
had
not
been
fully
appreciated
by
this
court
when
it
wrote
fourco
as
by
the
coulter
case.
now,
this
note
says,
that
the
new
subsection
gives
statutory
recognition
to
the
weight
of
authority
concerning
which
there
has
been
a
short
conflict
and
then
cites
two
district
court
cases.
these
were
both
of
the
higher
district
court
which
judge
westenhaver
had
decided
in
1917
and
1918.
now,
this
we
submit,
is
not
an
indication
of
a
changing
the
law,
because
in
1948
when
the
judicial
code
was
revised,
1391
(d)
being
added,
it
was
merely
a
codification
of
the
law
that
generally,
and
this
was
the
law
generally
recognize,
that
an
alien
could
be
sued
in
any
district
were
service
could
be
effected.
and
that's
what
1391
(d)
stood
for.
that
didn't
change
or
modify
1400
(b)
which
had
been
in
existence
in
a
prior
form
since
1897
which
still
controlled
in
patent
cases.
now,
if
it
had
been
the
congressional
intent,
in
1948
when
1391
(d)
was
to
change
this
well-established
law,
our
submission
is
that
there
would
have
been
an
appropriate
revision
obviously
in
the
patent
statute.
something
would
have
been
said
to
the
effect
except
as
aliens
or
in
some
situation
such
as
that.
now,
the
court's
decision
in
stonite
that
special
venue
is
the
sole
provision
governing
in
patent
case,
we
say
supports
the
position
we
have
taken.
the
court
has
repeatedly
had
this
before
and
then
several
congress
simply
said
that
as
far
as
all
defendants
in
patent
cases
concerned,
they
are
a
special
class.
it's
our
position
that
if
there
was
going
to
be
a
change
in
the
law
in
1948,
and
by
the
way,
the
revises
to
the
code
say
there
wasn't
any
change
in
the
1948
revision.
that
this
was
a
revision,
this
was
a
codification
of
the
law
as
it
stood.
there
certainly
would
have
been
a
more
positive,
a
stronger
statement
than
this
rather
ambiguous
note
which
was
--
and
appended
to
1391(d).
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
this
went
back
to
the
1897
act.
and
at
that
time,
it
was
felt
that
patent
--
defendants
in
patent
cases
should
not
be
subject
to
suit
any
place.
that
there
should
be
a
relationship
either
where
they
were
inhabitants
or
whether
they
committed
acts
of
infringement
and
had
a
regular
established
place
of
business.
a
practice
had
grown
up
after
the
hohorst,
keasbey
&
mattison
cases
in
which
they
would
be
sued
all
over
the
place.
and
therefore,
congress'
reaction
to
that
was
the
special
venue
statute.
i
think
that's
brought
out
in
the
footnote
that
mr.
mitchell
in
the
stonite
case.
now,
this
--
this
has
been
the
law
and
this
--
this
was
the
--
the
justification
for
it.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
yes.
i
am
not
urging
on
the
court
that
the
congress
intended
deliberately
to
exempt
any
particular
type
of
defendant,
let's
say
such
as
in
(a).
i
will
assume
that
under
1400
(b)
and
then
under
certain
circumstances
aliens
and
a
certain
type
of
alien
and
for
the
purpose
of
this
argument,
my
client
might
not
be
subject
to
suit
in
any
district
because
it
doesn't
qualify
under
1400
(b).
because
the
strongest
argument
the
plaintiff
of
course
can
make
is
that
there
was
at
the
congressional
intent
that
your
client
not
be
subject
to
suit
any
place.
no,
i
don't
think
that
was
the
congressional
intent.
i
think
there
may
have
been
a
gap.
i
think
that
possibly,
congress
had
not
considered
the
matter.
and
the
fact
of
course
is
that
the
thing
that
moved
judge
mansfield
and
certain,
other
the
courts
was
to
say,
“well,
now
here
are
a
group
of
defendants
who
fend
with
impunity
infringe
patents
and
fend
in
fringing
articles
into
the
united
states.”
well,
of
course
that
simply
isn't
the
case.
it's
is
a
practical
matter,
a
patent
owner
can
bring
suit
against
persons
who
makes,
uses,
or
sells.
so
if
can
get
the
maker,
he
can
get
the
user
and
the
seller
all
of
whom
are
in
this
country.
furthermore
of
course,
under
the
tariff
act,
and
where
the
decisions
we
cite
points
out,
that
congress
was
well-aware
of
the
situation
and
it
decided
it
was
going
to
take
care
of
this
thing
through
the
tariff
act.
section
337
of
the
tariff
act
says
that
if
there
is
an
infringement
over
united
states
patent,
you
go
through
the
treasury
department
and
you
can
stop
it
at
every
port
of
entry.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
no.
but
it
--
it
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
--
it
does
give
him
the
--
the
opportunity
to
stop
any
importation
and
it
has
the
additional
protection
that
he
never
has
to
subject
his
patent
to
a
question
of
validity
because
during
the
tariff
proceedings,
unless
the
patent
has
been
declared
invalid,
it
is
presumably
valid.
so
this
defence
can't
be
raised
in
the
tariff
proceedings.
so
it's
our
--
it
--
it
is
our
position
that
this
concern
of
the
certain
lower
court
cases
with
respect
what
will
happen
is
more
imaginary
than
real.
i
do
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
precisely,
and
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
there
maybe
gap
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
i
think
suggested.
certainly,
there
wasn't
congressional
intent
to
excuse.
but
once
you
analyze
what
went
on,
you
will
see
that
the
court
repeatedly
and
congress
in
--
though
it
had
the
matter
brought
to
its
attention,
never
did
anything
about
it.
now,
it
may
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
yes.
and
those
are
the
line
of
decisions
which
came
out
of
the
district
court
of
district
of
ohio.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
yes.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
yes.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
correct.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
now
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
actually,
the
conflict
had
been
settled
earlier
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
mentioned
that
the
earlier
cases,
they're
all
based
on
hohorst.
1893
and
1895
decisions
of
this
court
were
overruled
by
1897
act.
and
that
the
1897
act
of
which
1400
(b)
is
a
--
is
a
descendant,
simply
held
that
in
all
patent
infringement
cases,
special
venue
rather
that
general
venue
controls.
i'd
like
to
reserve
a
few
minutes.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
the
statement
by
this
court
in
stonite,
i
think
is
--
is
quite
illuminating.
it
said
that
the
act
of
1897
was
adopted
to
define
the
exact
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
in
actions
to
enforce
patent
rights
and
thus
illuminate
the
uncertainty
produced
by
the
conflicting
decisions
of
the
applicability
of
the
act
of
1897
as
amended
to
such
litigations.
their
purpose
indicates
that
congress
did
not
intend
that
the
act
of
1897
dovetail
with
the
general
provisions
relating
to
venue
of
frivolous
suits
but
rather
that
it
alone
should
control
venue
in
patent
infringement
proceedings.
now,
the
court
in
stonite
was
well
aware
of
the
situation
in
hohorst
because
it
had
just
gotten
through
quoting
a
long
footnote.
and
hohorst
was
the
case
which
had
discussed
venue
with
respect
to
aliens.
and
there
is
no
argument
that
prior
to
1897,
an
alien
could
be
sued
any
place.
and
if
hohorst,
as
far
as
its
holding,
is
still
good
law,
this
alien
can
be
sued.
but
it
is
our
position
that
congress,
when
it
enacted
1897,
repealed
hohorst
to
that
extent.
as
far
as
hohorst
had
two
holdings,
it
was
talking
about
aliens
and
then
it
was
talking
also
generally
about
venue.
but
as
far
as
aliens
being
subject
to
suit
any
place
that
was
repealed
by
the
act
of
1897
and
the
court
considered
it
and
said,
“there
wasn't
any
intention
to
have
any
dovetailing.
so
to
me,
this
indicates
that
when
the
court
wrote
the
stonite
opinion,
it
ruled
that
there
was
a
conflict
in
certain
cases,
namely
patent
cases
between
general
venue
and
special
venue
and
with
respect
to
all
defendants
not
just
domestic
defendants.
if
there
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
no.
there
was
not
an
alien
in
--
involved
in
it.
i
--
i
say
it
is
significant
in
view
of
the
suit
in
the
language
which
was
used
in
stonite
and
then
used
again
in
fourco
and
of
course
which
is
the
language
which
gives
the
respondent
here
the
most
trouble
because
the
court
did
say
this
covers
all
defendants
not
just
certain
kinds
of
defendants,
not
blue
either
gray
either
defendants,
it's
all
defendants.
and
of
course
all
defendants
includes
aliens
as
well
as
domestics.
so
the
court
had
very
definitely
taken
a
very
strong
position.
now,
it
could
be
that
there
--
and
there
are,
i
admit
that
there
are
a
group
of
defendants,
a
certain
selected
few
who
may
not
qualify
and
may
not
be
sued
any
place
if
there
is
--
then
there
has
been
some
kind
of
an
over
cite
or
a
gap
as
far
as
the
act
of
congress
are
concerned
because
the
1897
act
spoke
very
clearly.
if
there
has
been
a
gap
here,
then
there's
going
to
be
--
or
there
will
be
some
appropriate
change
in
the
law
and
that
will
be
for
congress.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
no.
there
haven't
been
any
bills
and
my
submission
is
of
course
this
is
not
a
significant
problem
because
the
domestic
patent
owners
are
adequately
and
well
protected
because
of
the
fact
that
they
can
sue
anybody
who
uses
or
sells
in
this
country
even
if
they
can't
get
the
maker,
plus
the
fact
that
they
have
all
this
protection
under
the
tariff
act.
so
that
this
is
not
a
significant
problem,
if
it
becomes
a
significant
problem,
i'm
certain
that
congress
will
take
of
care
it.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
i
know
of
none,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
it
cited
the
sandusky
case
which
was
a
case
involving
an
alien.
correct.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
yes.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
yes.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
it
says
that
1391
(d)
was
intended
to
codify
this
and
to
resolve
a
conflict
between
the
lower
district
courts.
now,
the
problem
with
the
sandusky
case
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
no.
i
[laughs]
--
i
submit,
mr.
justice
white,
that
that
is
not
what
it
resolved.
if
the
sandusky
was
based
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
it
simply
codified
the
general
venue
statute
which
is
--
you
see
there
haven't
--
with
respect
to
alien,
there
haven't
been
any
statute
with
respect
to
aliens
that
have
been
recognized
judicially
that
an
alien
can
be
sued
any
place.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
the
judicial
rules
that
an
alien
generally
could
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
--
be
sued
any
place.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
but
not
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
that
patent
case
talks
about
general
venue
as
well
as
patent
and
the
other
case
is
limited
to
general.
so
that
the
codification
--
our
position
is
merely
the
general
situation,
not
patent
defendants.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
the
revisors.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
yes.
he
--
he
relied
and
then
our
--
our
position
is
that
that
decision,
that
old
sandusky
decision
never
failed
--
failed
to
appreciate
the
point
which
mr.
justice
rehnquist
brought
up
that
the
act
of
1897
changed
the
hohorst.
they
all
based
on
hohorst
which
was
the
1893.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
congress
never
expressed
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
the
way
obviously
in
which
this
would
have
been
done
was
an
amendment
to
1400
(b),
defendants
except
aliens.
now,
this
was
--
this
would
have
been
a
major
change
and
there
was
where
the
change
would
have
been
instead
of
this
rather
ambiguous
note
which
is
mentioned
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
fourco
in
the
dissenting
opinion
by
mr.
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
--
mr.
justice
harlan.
this
is
--
this
note
is
rather
ambiguous,
i
don't
agree
with
it
so
[laughs].
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
so
i
think
obviously,
that's
the
case
it
would
have
been
made.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
thank
you.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
presented
for
review
is
which
of
two
federal
venue
statute
control
in
a
patent
infringement
suit.
one
of
them,
1391
(d)
is
a
venue
statute
which
controls
venue
generally
and
it
states
that
an
alien
maybe
sued
in
any
district.
the
other
statute,
1400
(b)
specifically
covers
the
situation
in
patent
infringement
action
and
it
provides
that
infringement
action
may
be
brought
in
the
district
where
the
defendant
resides,
or
where
the
defendants
has
committed
acts
of
infringement
and
has
regular
and
established
place
of
business.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
yes.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
it
is
not
--
it's
in
the
regular
established
place
of
business.
however,
in
the
particular
case
which
the
court
now
has
before
it,
that
is
not
important.
the
thing
that
is
significant
here
is,
what
was
the
history
of
the
special
venue
statute?
now,
this
court
has
passed
on
the
special
venue
statute
which
is
now
known
as
1400
(b),
three
times.
there
had
been
three
different
occasions
in
which
the
court
was
asked
to
expand
venue
in
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
it
--
it
is
not
important
in
this
case
because
there
isn't
any
question
that
under
the
special
venue
statute,
the
defendant
here
is
clear.
in
other
words,
if
the
special
venue
statute
controls,
there
is
no
venue.
if
the
general
venue
statute
controls,
there
is
venue.
so
it's
just
the
question
of
may
an
alien
--
you
see,
we
represent
a
canadian
defendant.
and
if
the
question
of
whether
an
alien
maybe
sued
any
place
under
the
general
venue
statute
or
may
the
defendant
claim
the
special
venue
statute.
now,
there
isn't
--
there
is
no
argument
that
we
do
not,
the
defendant,
does
not
qualify
under
the
special
venue
statute.
so
we
have
a
situation
here
which
controls
general
venue
or
special
venue.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
if
my
position
is
correct,
we
are
not
subject
to
suit.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
correct.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
i
thought
you
asked
me,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
whether
or
not
if
we
had
a
regular
and
established
place
of
business
and
whether
or
not
we
had
committed
acts
of
infringement
here.
more
important,
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
we
have
agreed
that
we
do
not
have
a
regular
and
established
place
of
business
and
we
have
not
committed
acts
of
infringement.
in
other
words,
if
special
venue
controls,
we're
not
covered,
were
out.
if
general
venue
controls,
we
are
because
we
are
an
alien.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
it
is
possible
at
--
in
certain
limited
situation
and
we're
willing
to
assume
it
for
the
purposes
of
this
case.
there
maybe
a
certain
class
of
defendants
in
infringement
cases
who
are
not
subject
to
an
infringement
suit
in
the
united
states.
you've
said
--
you've
said
it
completely
correctly,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
we
have
to
go
back
and
take
a
look
at
the
history
of
the
special
venue
statute
which
was
first
passed
in
1897
and
see
what
happened
and
what
this
court
did
with
respect
to
the
statute.
now,
the
court
held
in
the
three
prior
cases
that
the
special
venue
statute
controlled
as
to
all
defendants
and
i
emphasize
the
word
“all”
because
it
was
emphasized
by
the
court.
it
made
no
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
correct.
this
is
the
factual
difference
between
the
present
case
and
all
the
other
cases
which
the
court
has
considered,
namely
we
were
--
the
court
was
dealing
with
domestic
defendants.
now,
the
principle
which
we
say
that
governs
those
cases
is
still
the
same.
in
other
words,
it
is
our
position
that
the
act
of
1897
which
is
the
predecessor
of
1400
(b)
and
this
is
the
particular
statute
you
have
before
you.
in
that
act,
the
congress
very
clearly
un
--
unequivocally
as
this
court
has
stated
said,
that
special
venue
is
going
to
control
with
respect
to
all
defendants
irregardless
of
whether
or
not
they
are
domestic
or
alien.
now,
the
basic
facts
in
the
present
case
is
that
the
--
the
defendant,
brunette,
is
a
canadian
corporation
that
was
sued
in
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
oregon
for
infringement
of
two
patents,
brunette
is
not
a
resident
of
oregon
and
it
doesn't
have
a
regular
and
established
place
of
business
there.
the
brunette
motion
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
jurisdiction
obtained
under
a
--
there's
a
law
on
oregon
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
--
statute.
so
that
--
that
there
isn't
any
quarrel
about
jurisdiction.
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
granted.
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
based
on
a
decision
which
had
previously
been
handed
down
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
which
is
known
as
the
pfizer
case.
the
ninth
circuit
expressly
declined
to
follow
a
prior
decision
by
the
seventh
circuit
in
the
coulter
case
in
which
basically
the
same
factual
situation
had
been
presented,
namely
an
alien
defendant
claiming
improper
venue.
the
seventh
circuit
had
examined
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court,
came
to
the
conclusion
that
venue
was
improper
and
i
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
yes.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
and
--
and
judge
mansfield
refused
to
follow
and
expressly
mentioned
it.
and
our
position
is
now
that
the
problem
with
the
whole
line
of
cases,
and
there
had
been
district
court
cases
which
have
followed
pfizer
but
are
based
on
an
erroneous
line
of
district
court
cases.
and
it
is
our
position
that
these
cases
failed
to
appreciate
what
happened
in
1897
when
congress
passed
the
first
special
venue
statute.
now,
at
that
time,
the
court
--
this
court
had
already
decided
two
cases
involving
alien
defendants.
the
first
case
was
the
hohorst
case
in
1893.
and
that
case
involved
a
german
alien
in
a
patent
infringement
case,
and
the
court
said,
“alien
is
subject
to
suit
any
place”.
subsequently,
in
1895,
keasbey
&
mattison
came
along,
decided
by
this
court
and
keasbey
&
mattison
confirmed
hohorst,
an
alien
as
well
as
a
domestic.
keasbey
&
mattison
was
not
an
alien
case.
but
both
these
cases
stood
for
the
proposition
that
a
defendant
in
a
patent
infringement
case,
you
can
sue
in
any
place
you
can
get
service
on.
so,
the
act
of
1897
was
then
passed.
it
is
our
position
that
it
overruled
those
cases
because
congress,
when
it
passed
1897
act,
was
well
aware
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
hohorst
and
keasbey
&
mattison
for
that
which
they
stood.
and
now,
mind
you,
hohorost
did
stand
for
the
proposition
that
an
alien
could
be
sued
any
place.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
if
you
are
referring
to
the
legislative
history
with
respect
to
the
1948
of
the
1897
act
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
the
1897,
there
is
a
legislative
history
and
it's
set
forth
rather
fully
in
this
court's
opinion
in
stonite
which
is
the
first
case,
this
was
decided
in
1942.
there
were
footnote
in
stonite
and
they
go
a
little
rather
fully,
what
was
going
on
at
the
time
that
the
1897
act
was
passed
and
it
is
the
consensus
that
the
1897
act
was
passed
to
take
care
of
abuses
which
had
grown
in
patent
infringement
cases.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
the
history
does
not
indicate
any
specific
reference
to
hohorst
or
keasbey.
but
in
the
stonite
case,
the
court
does
discuss
hohorst
and
keasbey,
recognizes
the
situation
with
respect
to
hohorst
and
keasbey.
and
then
goes
on
to
say
that,
“we
decide
that
the
special
venue
statute
is
the
only
statute
controlling,”
and
it
excluded
everything
before
it.
now,
i
admit,
stonite
was
still
a
--
an
--
a
domestic
defendant.
there
was
not
an
alien
defendant
in
hohorst.
however,
in
the
stonite
decision
which
goes
into
the
history
rather
fully,
hohorst,
keasbey
and
all
the
other
cases
and
the
lower
court
cases
in
the
confusion
that
existed
among
the
lower
courts
with
respect
to
this
question
of
venue
in
patent
infringement,
is
examined
and
the
courts
says,
“congress
passed
the
1897
act
to
set
the
record
straight
and
make
it
clear
that
special
venue
controlled
in
all
infringement
cases”.
now,
the
next
time
that
the
court
had
the
question
before
it
was
in
the
fourco
case
in
1957.
now,
the
specific
question
presented
to
the
court
in
fourco
was
whether
1391
(c)
which
provided
that
a
corporation
can
be
sued
in
any
judicial
district
in
which
it
is
doing
business
was
supplem
--
was
supplementary
to
1400
(b).
now,
at
the
time
that
the
court
decided
fourco,
1957,
the
1948
revision
to
the
judicial
code
had
taken
place
and
it
was
at
that
time
that
the
subsessions
which
we
are
considering
and
specifically
1391
(d)
were
added
to
the
law.
now,
the
--
the
approach
which
the
court
took
in
fourco
was,
the
holding
in
stonite
that
the
special
venue
statute
controls
and
is
exclusive
is
still
good
law
unless
there
was
some
change
in
the
1948
revision
to
the
judicial
code.
again
i
say
that's
when
section
(c)
and
(d)
were
added.
the
court
was
specifically
considering
(c)
in
stonite.
the
court
came
to
the
conclusion
and
it
again
reviewed
the
history
of
the
1948
revision
and
what
had
happened
before
that
there
had
been
no
intended
change
in
the
law
and
that
therefore,
1400
(b)
remain
controlling
as
to
all
defendants
in
patent
infringement
cases,
and
that
1391
(c)
should
not
be
read
as
supplementary
to
1400
(b).
the
last
time
that
this
court
had
the
question
before
it
was
in
1961
and
that
was
in
schnell
case.
again,
the
court
briefly
reviewed
the
history,
came
to
the
conclusion
as
it
had
in
the
other
two
cases.
it
reaffirmed
its
decisions
in
stonite
and
fourco,
namely
that
1400
(b)
is
the
exclusive
provision
controlling
venue
in
patent
infringement.
and
the
court
specifically
said
in
schnell
that
the
attempts
to
broaden
patent
venue
were
contrary
--
contrary
to
the
congressional
intent.
and
as
far
as
the
court
was
concerned,
would
involve
judicial
legislation.now,
this
point
was
well
understood
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
in
terms
of
alien,
it
does
not.
it
quotes
from
what
mr.
mitchell
had
to
say.
however,
you
will
note
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
hohorst
is
discussed
in
the
footnote
of
stonite.
stonite
of
course
dealt
with
the
domestic,
but
hohorst
was
recognized
at
the
time
that
the
--
the
court
was
running
its
opinion
as
it
was
in
1897
when
the
act
was
passed.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
no.
mr.
mitchell
does
not
talk
about
hohorst.
however,
the
court
when
it
wrote
stonite,
had
hohorst
in
mind.
now,
it's
our
position
that
an
alien
just
like
a
domestic
defendant
who's
involved
in
a
patent
case,
that
this
doesn't
justify
a
change
in
the
interpretation
of
the
law
which
this
court
has
had
for
the
last
75
years.
now,
the
principle
argument
which
is
urged
on
this
court
and
which
apparently
carried
the
day
before
judge
mansfield
was
that
the
revisers
note
to
1391
(d)
--
and
it
emphasized
that
in
the
fourco
case,
1400
(b)
had
not
--
that
the
--
that
this
had
not
been
fully
appreciated
by
this
court
when
it
wrote
fourco
as
by
the
coulter
case.
now,
this
note
says,
that
the
new
subsection
gives
statutory
recognition
to
the
weight
of
authority
concerning
which
there
has
been
a
short
conflict
and
then
cites
two
district
court
cases.
these
were
both
of
the
higher
district
court
which
judge
westenhaver
had
decided
in
1917
and
1918.
now,
this
we
submit,
is
not
an
indication
of
a
changing
the
law,
because
in
1948
when
the
judicial
code
was
revised,
1391
(d)
being
added,
it
was
merely
a
codification
of
the
law
that
generally,
and
this
was
the
law
generally
recognize,
that
an
alien
could
be
sued
in
any
district
were
service
could
be
effected.
and
that's
what
1391
(d)
stood
for.
that
didn't
change
or
modify
1400
(b)
which
had
been
in
existence
in
a
prior
form
since
1897
which
still
controlled
in
patent
cases.
now,
if
it
had
been
the
congressional
intent,
in
1948
when
1391
(d)
was
to
change
this
well-established
law,
our
submission
is
that
there
would
have
been
an
appropriate
revision
obviously
in
the
patent
statute.
something
would
have
been
said
to
the
effect
except
as
aliens
or
in
some
situation
such
as
that.
now,
the
court's
decision
in
stonite
that
special
venue
is
the
sole
provision
governing
in
patent
case,
we
say
supports
the
position
we
have
taken.
the
court
has
repeatedly
had
this
before
and
then
several
congress
simply
said
that
as
far
as
all
defendants
in
patent
cases
concerned,
they
are
a
special
class.
it's
our
position
that
if
there
was
going
to
be
a
change
in
the
law
in
1948,
and
by
the
way,
the
revises
to
the
code
say
there
wasn't
any
change
in
the
1948
revision.
that
this
was
a
revision,
this
was
a
codification
of
the
law
as
it
stood.
there
certainly
would
have
been
a
more
positive,
a
stronger
statement
than
this
rather
ambiguous
note
which
was
--
and
appended
to
1391(d).
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
this
went
back
to
the
1897
act.
and
at
that
time,
it
was
felt
that
patent
--
defendants
in
patent
cases
should
not
be
subject
to
suit
any
place.
that
there
should
be
a
relationship
either
where
they
were
inhabitants
or
whether
they
committed
acts
of
infringement
and
had
a
regular
established
place
of
business.
a
practice
had
grown
up
after
the
hohorst,
keasbey
&
mattison
cases
in
which
they
would
be
sued
all
over
the
place.
and
therefore,
congress'
reaction
to
that
was
the
special
venue
statute.
i
think
that's
brought
out
in
the
footnote
that
mr.
mitchell
in
the
stonite
case.
now,
this
--
this
has
been
the
law
and
this
--
this
was
the
--
the
justification
for
it.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
yes.
i
am
not
urging
on
the
court
that
the
congress
intended
deliberately
to
exempt
any
particular
type
of
defendant,
let's
say
such
as
in
(a).
i
will
assume
that
under
1400
(b)
and
then
under
certain
circumstances
aliens
and
a
certain
type
of
alien
and
for
the
purpose
of
this
argument,
my
client
might
not
be
subject
to
suit
in
any
district
because
it
doesn't
qualify
under
1400
(b).
because
the
strongest
argument
the
plaintiff
of
course
can
make
is
that
there
was
at
the
congressional
intent
that
your
client
not
be
subject
to
suit
any
place.
no,
i
don't
think
that
was
the
congressional
intent.
i
think
there
may
have
been
a
gap.
i
think
that
possibly,
congress
had
not
considered
the
matter.
and
the
fact
of
course
is
that
the
thing
that
moved
judge
mansfield
and
certain,
other
the
courts
was
to
say,
“well,
now
here
are
a
group
of
defendants
who
fend
with
impunity
infringe
patents
and
fend
in
fringing
articles
into
the
united
states.”
well,
of
course
that
simply
isn't
the
case.
it's
is
a
practical
matter,
a
patent
owner
can
bring
suit
against
persons
who
makes,
uses,
or
sells.
so
if
can
get
the
maker,
he
can
get
the
user
and
the
seller
all
of
whom
are
in
this
country.
furthermore
of
course,
under
the
tariff
act,
and
where
the
decisions
we
cite
points
out,
that
congress
was
well-aware
of
the
situation
and
it
decided
it
was
going
to
take
care
of
this
thing
through
the
tariff
act.
section
337
of
the
tariff
act
says
that
if
there
is
an
infringement
over
united
states
patent,
you
go
through
the
treasury
department
and
you
can
stop
it
at
every
port
of
entry.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
no.
but
it
--
it
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
--
it
does
give
him
the
--
the
opportunity
to
stop
any
importation
and
it
has
the
additional
protection
that
he
never
has
to
subject
his
patent
to
a
question
of
validity
because
during
the
tariff
proceedings,
unless
the
patent
has
been
declared
invalid,
it
is
presumably
valid.
so
this
defence
can't
be
raised
in
the
tariff
proceedings.
so
it's
our
--
it
--
it
is
our
position
that
this
concern
of
the
certain
lower
court
cases
with
respect
what
will
happen
is
more
imaginary
than
real.
i
do
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
precisely,
and
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
there
maybe
gap
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
i
think
suggested.
certainly,
there
wasn't
congressional
intent
to
excuse.
but
once
you
analyze
what
went
on,
you
will
see
that
the
court
repeatedly
and
congress
in
--
though
it
had
the
matter
brought
to
its
attention,
never
did
anything
about
it.
now,
it
may
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
yes.
and
those
are
the
line
of
decisions
which
came
out
of
the
district
court
of
district
of
ohio.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
yes.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
yes.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
correct.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
now
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
actually,
the
conflict
had
been
settled
earlier
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
mentioned
that
the
earlier
cases,
they're
all
based
on
hohorst.
1893
and
1895
decisions
of
this
court
were
overruled
by
1897
act.
and
that
the
1897
act
of
which
1400
(b)
is
a
--
is
a
descendant,
simply
held
that
in
all
patent
infringement
cases,
special
venue
rather
that
general
venue
controls.
i'd
like
to
reserve
a
few
minutes.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
the
statement
by
this
court
in
stonite,
i
think
is
--
is
quite
illuminating.
it
said
that
the
act
of
1897
was
adopted
to
define
the
exact
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
in
actions
to
enforce
patent
rights
and
thus
illuminate
the
uncertainty
produced
by
the
conflicting
decisions
of
the
applicability
of
the
act
of
1897
as
amended
to
such
litigations.
their
purpose
indicates
that
congress
did
not
intend
that
the
act
of
1897
dovetail
with
the
general
provisions
relating
to
venue
of
frivolous
suits
but
rather
that
it
alone
should
control
venue
in
patent
infringement
proceedings.
now,
the
court
in
stonite
was
well
aware
of
the
situation
in
hohorst
because
it
had
just
gotten
through
quoting
a
long
footnote.
and
hohorst
was
the
case
which
had
discussed
venue
with
respect
to
aliens.
and
there
is
no
argument
that
prior
to
1897,
an
alien
could
be
sued
any
place.
and
if
hohorst,
as
far
as
its
holding,
is
still
good
law,
this
alien
can
be
sued.
but
it
is
our
position
that
congress,
when
it
enacted
1897,
repealed
hohorst
to
that
extent.
as
far
as
hohorst
had
two
holdings,
it
was
talking
about
aliens
and
then
it
was
talking
also
generally
about
venue.
but
as
far
as
aliens
being
subject
to
suit
any
place
that
was
repealed
by
the
act
of
1897
and
the
court
considered
it
and
said,
“there
wasn't
any
intention
to
have
any
dovetailing.
so
to
me,
this
indicates
that
when
the
court
wrote
the
stonite
opinion,
it
ruled
that
there
was
a
conflict
in
certain
cases,
namely
patent
cases
between
general
venue
and
special
venue
and
with
respect
to
all
defendants
not
just
domestic
defendants.
if
there
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
no.
there
was
not
an
alien
in
--
involved
in
it.
i
--
i
say
it
is
significant
in
view
of
the
suit
in
the
language
which
was
used
in
stonite
and
then
used
again
in
fourco
and
of
course
which
is
the
language
which
gives
the
respondent
here
the
most
trouble
because
the
court
did
say
this
covers
all
defendants
not
just
certain
kinds
of
defendants,
not
blue
either
gray
either
defendants,
it's
all
defendants.
and
of
course
all
defendants
includes
aliens
as
well
as
domestics.
so
the
court
had
very
definitely
taken
a
very
strong
position.
now,
it
could
be
that
there
--
and
there
are,
i
admit
that
there
are
a
group
of
defendants,
a
certain
selected
few
who
may
not
qualify
and
may
not
be
sued
any
place
if
there
is
--
then
there
has
been
some
kind
of
an
over
cite
or
a
gap
as
far
as
the
act
of
congress
are
concerned
because
the
1897
act
spoke
very
clearly.
if
there
has
been
a
gap
here,
then
there's
going
to
be
--
or
there
will
be
some
appropriate
change
in
the
law
and
that
will
be
for
congress.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
no.
there
haven't
been
any
bills
and
my
submission
is
of
course
this
is
not
a
significant
problem
because
the
domestic
patent
owners
are
adequately
and
well
protected
because
of
the
fact
that
they
can
sue
anybody
who
uses
or
sells
in
this
country
even
if
they
can't
get
the
maker,
plus
the
fact
that
they
have
all
this
protection
under
the
tariff
act.
so
that
this
is
not
a
significant
problem,
if
it
becomes
a
significant
problem,
i'm
certain
that
congress
will
take
of
care
it.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
i
know
of
none,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
it
cited
the
sandusky
case
which
was
a
case
involving
an
alien.
correct.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
yes.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
yes.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
it
says
that
1391
(d)
was
intended
to
codify
this
and
to
resolve
a
conflict
between
the
lower
district
courts.
now,
the
problem
with
the
sandusky
case
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
no.
i
[laughs]
--
i
submit,
mr.
justice
white,
that
that
is
not
what
it
resolved.
if
the
sandusky
was
based
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
it
simply
codified
the
general
venue
statute
which
is
--
you
see
there
haven't
--
with
respect
to
alien,
there
haven't
been
any
statute
with
respect
to
aliens
that
have
been
recognized
judicially
that
an
alien
can
be
sued
any
place.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
the
judicial
rules
that
an
alien
generally
could
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
--
be
sued
any
place.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
but
not
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
that
patent
case
talks
about
general
venue
as
well
as
patent
and
the
other
case
is
limited
to
general.
so
that
the
codification
--
our
position
is
merely
the
general
situation,
not
patent
defendants.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
the
revisors.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
yes.
he
--
he
relied
and
then
our
--
our
position
is
that
that
decision,
that
old
sandusky
decision
never
failed
--
failed
to
appreciate
the
point
which
mr.
justice
rehnquist
brought
up
that
the
act
of
1897
changed
the
hohorst.
they
all
based
on
hohorst
which
was
the
1893.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
congress
never
expressed
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
the
way
obviously
in
which
this
would
have
been
done
was
an
amendment
to
1400
(b),
defendants
except
aliens.
now,
this
was
--
this
would
have
been
a
major
change
and
there
was
where
the
change
would
have
been
instead
of
this
rather
ambiguous
note
which
is
mentioned
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
fourco
in
the
dissenting
opinion
by
mr.
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
--
mr.
justice
harlan.
this
is
--
this
note
is
rather
ambiguous,
i
don't
agree
with
it
so
[laughs].
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
so
i
think
obviously,
that's
the
case
it
would
have
been
made.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
thank
you.
