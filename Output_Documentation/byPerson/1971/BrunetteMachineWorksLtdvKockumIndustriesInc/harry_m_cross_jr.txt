mr.
harry
m.
cross,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
i
wonder
if
congress
did
not
intend
the
result
that
the
petitioner
is
suggesting,
whether
any
venue
statute
at
all
is
required
to
effect
the
judicial
power
of
united
states
as
promulgated
in
the
federal
statute.
what
the
petitioner
is
urging
is
a
frustration
of
the
federal
judicial
power.
venue,
as
i
understand
it
in
a
federal
cause
of
action
is
intended
to
direct
the
geographical
area
where
federal
judicial
power
is
to
be
applied,
not
if
it's
going
to
be
applied
but
where.
the
petitioner
is
urging
the
court
to
apply
a
very
broad
language
from
the
fourco
case
out
of
context
and
without
regard
to
the
legislative
and
judicial
history
that
upon
which
both
the
fourco
in
the
stonite
cases
were
based.
insofar
as
alien
venue
is
concerned,
i
would
like
to
suggest
that
the
patent
venue
statute
as
originally
promulgated
in
1897
was
not
a
restrictive
statute.
beginning
with
the
--
the
view
presented
in
the
stonite
decision
and
specifically,
with
two
cases
cited
in
the
stonite
decision
at
315
u.s.
567.
this
cases
being
the
bowers
case,
104
f.887
and
the
cheatham
electric
case,
191
f.727
at
which
a
detail
of
the
history
of
the
1897
act
is
presented.
prior
to
the
first
patent
venue
statute
of
1897,
there
initially
was
a
general
venue
statute
of
1770
--
of
1875
that
provider
that
a
defendant
in
any
case
can
be
sued
wherever
he
was
found.
in
the
general
venue
statute
of
1887
and
1888,
that
was
modified
in
cases
where
the
federal
courts
had
concurrent
jurisdiction
to
providing
venue
over
to
defendants
in
which
--
in
the
district
in
which
they
were
inhabitants.
now,
that's
a
substantial
limitation
over
where
they
may
be
found.
but
it's
important
to
note
that
that
general
venue
statute
was
strictly
limited
to
cases
of
concurrent
jurisdiction.
when
this
court
reached
the
subject
of
alien
venue
in
a
patent
case
in
1893
in
the
hohorst
decision,
it
first
of
all
settled.
there
is
no
expression
in
the
statutes
of
1887
and
1888
that
venue
--
that
--
that
that
venue
statute
applies
to
an
alien
since
there's
nothing
to
indicate
that
it
was
congressional
intent
that
that
statute
so
apply
to
an
alien.
they
concluded
that
it
did
not
and
that
an
alien
could
be
sued
anywhere.
the
second
holding
in
that
case
which
is
most
important
is
that
a
federal
patent
action
based
on
a
federal
statute,
the
federal
courts
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
since
the
statute
of
1887
and
1888
was
directed
to
causes
where
the
federal
courts
had
concurrent
jurisdiction.
it
simply
do
not
apply
in
a
federal
patent
action.
therefore,
for
this
certain
reason,
that
statute
didn't
apply.
the
keasbey-mattison
supreme
court
decision
reaffirmed
both
those
points.
it
was
at
that
time
that
the
lower
circuit
courts
generally
permitted
suits
against
patent
infringers
without
regard
whether
they
were
aliens
or
domestics.
the
passage
of
the
first
patent
venue
statute
of
1897
was
directed
toward
the
second
point
in
hohorst.
it
was
intended
according
to
the
mallory's
case
to
place
patent
venue
on
a
par
with
general
venue.
it
first
of
all
provided
that
in
patent
infringement
cases,
venue
was
to
be
held
where
the
defendant
was
an
inhabitant.
that
is
exactly
the
same
as
was
in
the
1887
and
1888
general
venue
statute.
in
addition,
congress
provided
that
an
alien
--
excuse
me,
that
an
infringer
could
be
sued
at
the
place
he
infringed
and
where
he
had
a
regular
and
established
place
of
business,
that
as
another
district.
so
to
that
extend,
it
is
broader
than
the
general
venue
statutes
of
1887
and
1888.
mr.
harry
m.
cross,
jr.
it's
a
statement
of
the
case,
statement
of
the
history.
continuing
from
--
from
the
point
of
1897,
the
--
the
case
was
immediately
following
that
are
substantially
contemporaneous
with
the
act,
adopted
this
point
of
view
that
the
first
point
on
which
the
hohorst
decision
was
based
was
not
modified.
that
it
was
simply
to
bring
the
patent
venue
on
a
par
with
general
venue.
the
--
the
first
decision
is
united
shoe
machinery
case,
it's
cited
in
our
brief.
and
subsequent
to
that
is
the
sandusky
case
that
is
cited
by
the
revisor
and
is
a
note
to
1391
(d).
and
regarding
it
for
a
moment
the
sandusky
case
contrary
to
the
inference
to
be
drawn
from
the
petitioner's
reply
brief,
the
sandusky
case
is
a
--
has
two
decisions.
there's
a
two
point
decision
and
the
first
one
definitely
holds
that
an
alien
in
a
patent
infringement
action
is
suable
wherever
he
can
be
found.
it's
not
dictum,
that's
a
positive
holding.
at
the
time
of
this
court's
decision
in
stonite,
the
general
rule
as
applied
to
venue
over
aliens
was
a
judicial
rule,
it
was
not
statutory.
these
prior
lower
court
decisions,
continuing
to
reapply
the
hohorst
decision
as
to
patent
alien
venue
are
not
inconsistent
with
stonite's
holding.
stonite,
even
the
language
of
stonite
clearly
says
that
the
then
patent
venue
statute,
section
48
of
the
1911
judicial
code
that
statutory
provision
is
not
modified
by
other
provisions
or
to
venue.
they're
talking
about
other
statutory
provisions.
no
consideration
was
given
to
the
judicial
rule
of
venue,
whatsoever.
the
difficulty
is
created
in
this
case
by
the
fact
that
in
fourco,
this
court
stated
that
the
issue
before
fourco
was
legally
indistinguishable
from
the
issue
before
stonite.
between
stonite
and
fourco
however,
1391
(d)
codified
the
judicial
law
on
alien
venue.
mr.
harry
m.
cross,
jr.
that's
right.
therefore,
by
repeating
generally
the
phraseology
of
stonite
in
fourco,
i
think
inadvertently,
the
language
became
too
broad.
because
then
when
you
talk
in
terms
of
statutory
provisions
not
being
supplemental
law,
that
does
not
comply
with
the
previous
judicial
rule
that
was
codified
in
1391
(d).
the
effect
of
--
of
the
request
by
the
petitioner
is
become
--
is
going
to
become
significantly
more
important
i
think
in
the
future.
the
number
of
recent
cases
concerned
with
this
problem
reflects
an
economic
change
in
this
country.
more
and
more,
new
technologies
in
whatever
form
are
going
to
be
imported
into
this
country
rather
than
vice
versa.
certainly,
there
is
nothing
--
there
is
nothing
objectionable
in
that.
but
it's
certainly
true
that
is
done
for
for
a
profit
motive
and
if
aliens
can
see
a
profit
in
employing
their
technologies
into
this
country.
and
by
so
doing,
violate
a
federal
statute
and
do
it
in
such
an
angle
that
there's
a
--
got
themselves
to
the
--
in
pursuant
of
jurisdiction
of
federal
courts.
it
seems
to
me
in
congress
that
venue
wouldn't
be
so
restrictedly
interpreted
as
to
ours
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts.
