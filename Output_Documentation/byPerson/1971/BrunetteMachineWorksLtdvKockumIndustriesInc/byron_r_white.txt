justice
byron
r.
white
well,
has
there
been
judicial
decisions
under
14
--
under
--
under
the
predecessor
of
the
1400,
section
48
that
an
alien
could
be
sued
anywhere?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there's
--
alright,
there
had
been
some
holdings
to
that
effect
and
that
there
had
been
some
holdings
to
the
contrary
effect,
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
came
forth
--
and
then
came
to
revision
of
1948?
justice
byron
r.
white
1400
(b).
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
you
say
that
1400
(b)
which
--
which
didn't
say
anything
different
than
from
section
48,
settled
that
conflict
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
--
justice
byron
r.
white
when
a
--
when
congress
passed
1391
(d),
they
did
--
the
revisors
knows
--
did
cite
some
case
laws.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
including
alien
patent
cases.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
holding
that
you
could
sue
an
alien
anywhere.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
a
patent
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
says
that
1391
(d)
was
intended
to
codify
this
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
resolved
the
conflict,
alright,
then
--
and
--
and
resolved
it
in
favor
of
letting
the
alien
be
sued
anywhere.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
said
it
resolved
--

justice
byron
r.
white
well
maybe
sandusky
was
wrong
but
how
about
congress?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
congress
might
--
in
--
in
putting

the
books,
i
doubt
if
you'd
been
the
reviser,
if
you
hadn't
intended
to
codify
the
result
of
sandusky,
you
certainly
wouldn't
have
