the

him
at
(inaudible)
justice
byron

white
he
made
the
statement,
what
did
he
say
to
(inaudible)
this
charge?
justice
byron

white
was
that
(inaudible)
justice
byron

white
but
none
of
that
happened
(inaudible)
as
a
matter
of
fact,
snell
played
a
long
way
to
(inaudible)
justice
byron

white
was
snell
(inaudible)
justice
byron

white
(inaudible)
justice
byron

white
and
apparently
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
how
did
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
how
did
you
treat
snell's
statement?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know
you
weren't
but
you
were
--
that
you
were
--
i
suppose
if
you
thought
that
snell's
confession
which
was
introduced,
implicated
or
harmed
your
client,
you'd
have
said
something
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
the
only
way
that
you
remember
they
were
placed
together
in
the
same
car
through
schneble's
submission
which
is
confirmed
by
snell,
that
they
were
together
in
the
car?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
now
is
it
the
florida
rule
that
a
man
can
be
convicted
on
his
own
confession,
must
it
be
--
have
some
kind
of
corroboration?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
snell?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
mean
by
corpus
delicti?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
that
without
--
let's
assume
that
snell's
testimony
had
been
ruled
inadmissible
wholly.
well,
let's
assume
they
have
been
tried
separately
and
no
attempt
was
made
to
introduce
snell's
testimony
against
schneble.
could
there
be
a
verdict
against
schneble?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
know.
i
suppose
i
could
have
still
been
able
to
use
contention
against
his
as
long
as
he
was
involved
in
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
understand
that
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
without
whose
statement?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
agree
with
that,
but
let's
assume
that
you
introduce
schneble's
testimony
or
his
confession,
it's
ruled
voluntary
and
admissible.
could
the
state
lose
its
case
without
snell's
admission?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
your
position?
if
they
were
tried
together,
i
suppose
that
the
reason
for
introducing
snell's
statement,
is
it
perfectly
obvious
they
were
introduced
against
him
at
least?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
request
that
snell's
statement
not
be
used
against
schneble?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
wasn't
that
--
wasn't
that
the
standard
rule
in
florida
to
form
groups
or
(inaudible)
the
admissions
of
the
co-defendant
should
only
be
used
against
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
(inaudible)
if
you
thought
those
were
damaging,
it
looks
to
me
like
you
would
have
objected
to
the
introduction
of
prejudice
against
schneble
or
at
least
that
part
of
the
instruction?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
what
bruton
said?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
the
--
did
snell's
admissions
at
least
ties
the
two
men
together
with
the
crime?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
didn't
even
mention
schneble.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
didn't
say
he
was
sitting
in
the
backseat?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
lieutenant
yates
testified
that
snell
told
him
that
schneble
had
occupied
the
rear
seat
of
the
automobile
and
that
he
snell,
had
occupied
the
driver's
seat,
does
that
fit?
let's
assume
that
--
is
that
--
would
you
suppose
that,
that's
what
verify
schneble’s
confession
as
to
where
he
was
sitting?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
schneble
say
he
was
sitting
in
the
back
seat?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
it
contradicts
schneble?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
schneble
say
that
he
wrangled
from
the
front
to
the
back
seat?
