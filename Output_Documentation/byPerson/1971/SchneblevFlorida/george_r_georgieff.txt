mr.
george
r.
georgieff
may
it
please
the
court.
i
was
hearing
some
of
the
questions
from
the
bench,
i
am
tempted
to
truly
cavalierly,
but
i
don't
mean
to
do
that
at
all.
we've
heard
a
long
recitation
here.
i
suspect
it
talks
around
much
of
what
he
should
be
saying
very
positively,
if
he
is
going
to
demonstrate
a
bruton
violation.
as
i
understand
the
court's
order,
that's
exactly
what
we're
here
for.
it
makes
reference
to
a
series
of
pages
of
testimony
wherein
your
supposed
to
find
this
implicating
testimony
that
did
so
much
harm
to
schneble.
i
have
three
pages
over
here
and
there
are
some
40
odd
pages
to
which
he
makes
reference.
i
read
it
again
last
night
and
if
it's
there,
then
thing
for
you
would
do
is
of
course
reverse
it.
but
if
you
find
anything
in
there
that
implicates
schneble
in
anyway,
i
got
these
line
to
heed
it.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
he
sure
did
not.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no.
now
i'll
tell
you
this.
obviously,
during
the
course
of
the
trial
it
developed
somewhere
along
the
line
that
these
two
men
were
in
the
car,
but
it
didn't
come
from
that
you
see.
it
came
from
schneble's
confession.
not
only
did
he
confess
in
great
detail,
but
he
took
them
to
where
the
body
was.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
oh!
yes.
no
question
about
that,
that’s
correct,
sure
they
are
and
obviously
all
you
got
to
do
is
have
maddock's
testimony
to
put
him
in
the
automobile.
what
they
did
was
they
took
a
route
from
new
orleans
along
the
coast,
all
the
way
down
to
key
west,
approximately,
i
would
say
11,
12
maybe
1300
miles.
somewhere
along
the
way,
this
woman
was
killed,
she
was
dumped
in
hillsborough
county
in
the
greater
tampa.
they
went
on
down
to
key
west,
came
back
up,
were
picked
up
in
west
palm
and
that's
when
this
series
of
events
occurred.
so
you
have
nothing
from
snell.
by
the
way,
here
in
the
(inaudible),
well
sure
of
that,
his
nick
name
is
lucky.
he
didn't
tell
them
anything.
no
complicity
on
his
part,
not
on
schneble's
part,
none
whatsoever.
this
is
what
he
said.
when
you
find
this
body
--
if
and
when
you
find
this
body,
you
will
find
a
polyethylene
cord
and
don't
overlook
the
obvious.
now
i
don't
know
what
that’s
supposed
to
do
to
schneble,
but
he
hadn’t
already
done
himself.
now
as
i
understood
bruton
and
i
think
everybody
else
does,
there
wasn't
any
questions,
i
represented
the
state,
when
you
remanded
this
matter
to
the
florida
supreme
court
and
the
position
i
am
taking
here
is
a
position
i
took
there.
we
agree
that
snell
suffered
under
schneble's
confession.
he
did
not
take
the
stand,
there
was
no
cross-examination,
but
a
clear
bruton
violation.
he
put
snell
in
the
bag
just
as
pretty,
as
you
please.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
i
do
not
quite
dicta,
mr.
justice
brennan.
it
really,
and
i
hope
they
forgive
me,
it
really
has
no
place
in
this.
they
reversed
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
they
do
say
that.
if
you
would
like
i
will
read
it
for
you.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
right.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
sure.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
yes
they
did.
now
the
part
that
you
may
recall
is
really
six
lines,
let
me
read
it
to
you.
i
am
reading
from
this
slip
opinion.
“in
as
much
if
there
was
no
prior
unconstitutional
confession
by
schneble,
as
in
bruton,
and
schneble's
confession
was
found
to
be
admissible,
we
again
affirm
conviction
in
schneble
v.
state
and
hold
that
conclusion
not
inconsistent
with
bruton.
the
authority
cited
by
the
supreme
court
of
united
states,
it
is
so
ordered.”
so
yes,
they
do,
and
no,
they
don't.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
i
do
to,
but
perhaps
not
as
much
as
do
you.
yeah,
i
was
there
and
i
remember
what
the
argument
was,
that's
no
good
to
you
because
you
don't
have
it
written,
i
understand
that.
and
yes,
put
cold
the
way
it
is
here
today.
you
have
the
transcript
from
the
first
proceeding,
by
the
way
before
you.
you
can
read
it
as
many
times
as
you
like
and
unless
you
have
some
sort
of
magic,
you
just
can't
find
any
implication
in
there.
now
whatever
the
reason,
let's
assume
they
have
reached
this
reason
or
rather
this
result
for
the
wrong
reason.
if
their
result
is
correct,
it
really
doesn't
make
any
difference.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
i
hope
when
the
internalizing
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes
sir,
exactly.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
to
begin
with
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
he
didn't
say
that.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no.
all
he
said
was
--
well,
actually
all
he
said
that's
not
true.
among
other
things
he
said,
you'll
find
that
my
fingerprints
are
only
in
the
front
seat.
now
either
by
casting
out
nines,
eliminations,
whichever
way
you
want,
if
they
were
found
together
the
presumption
has
to
follow
i
suppose,
that
the
other
person
was
in
the
back
seat.
but
he
never
mentioned
his
name
so
conceivably
there
could
have
been
somebody
else
in
there
don't
you
think.
now
i
don't
know
if
we
can
reach
back
geographically
and
both
historically
and
determine
that
because
they
were
found
in
the
car
in
west
palm
that
on
their
trip,
that
schneble
was
physically
in
the
back
seat.
if
he
was,
they
didn't
find
that
out
from
snell,
they
didn't
found
out
anything
from
him.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
collides
with
it.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
but
he
was
sitting
in
the
front.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
say
that's
colllidable
statement
you
see.
snell
is
a
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
as
i
recall
he
did.
no,
no,
no,
did
you
say
it
from
the
backseat?
no,
i
think
he
said
he
reached
over
from
the
front
and
did
it.
that's
my
recollection
of
it,
please
don't
hold
me
to
it.
i
haven't
gone
into
the
explicit
details
of
schneble's
confession
because
of
the
organic
position
i
took
based
on
your
request
here.
but
my
recollection
is
if
there
was
a
reach
over
in
the
strangulation
of
this
woman.
now
corpus
delicti
in
florida
three
things
in
a
murder
prosecution,
that
there
is
a
dead
body,
that
it
has
an
identity,
and
that
it
was
the
result
of
the
criminal
agency
of
another.
now
that
darn
sure
didn't
come
from
snell.
no
way,
as
i
read
anything
to
which
others
say
he
testified
to
them
or
gave
a
statement
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
oh!
yes.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
from
the
officer
who
testified
that
after
the
scene,
when
they
picked
them
up
on
this
alleged
--
well
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
did
have
a
light
violation
when
they
were
stooped
and
probably
the
testimony
will
reveal
that
there
was
some
confusion
as
to
allegedly
misunderstanding
what
the
officer
purported
them
to
do
when
he
stopped
them.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
alright
now,
then
the
officer
testified
that
schneble
told
him
that
he
was
a
hitchhiker
and
been
picked
up
by
this
man
on
his
way
out
of
the
keys
as
i
understand.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that
came
from
schneble,
never
from
snell.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
now
i
don't
know
that
it
makes
it
clear
that
he
wasn't
a
hitchhiker,
he
doesn't
mention
the
man's
name
at
all,
don't
you
see.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
oh!
i
would
think
that
it
would
mr.
justice
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no
i
understand,
if
that
were
the
case,
i
would
agree
that
there
is
at
least
something
here
that
ought
to
be
examined
at
least
more
closely,
but
that
isn't
so.
you
see
snell
never
[voice
overlap]
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
like
what?
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
but
that
came
from
schneble
you
see.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
now
we
are
talking
about
what
snell
says,
to
put
him
under
bruton,
i
tell
you
there
is
nothing.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
no,
i
means
yes
whichever
applies.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that's
correct.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
because
you
see
there
is
an
individual
in
the
car
but
never
mentions
him
by
name.
and
i
say,
that
if
you
are
going
to
find
out
that
it
was
schneble,
you
are
going
to
have
to
surmise
that
going
back
from
west
palm
to
key
west
all
the
way
back
up
florida’s
gulf
coast,
and
new
orleans
you
are
going
to
have
to
place
schneble
in
there,
based
on
snell's
testimony,
and
you
cannot
do
it.
because
he
denied
any
complicity
himself
and
he
certainly
never
mentioned
schneble.
all
he
said
was,
if
and
when
you
find
his
body
don't
overlook
the
obvious
and
there
will
be
a
polyethylene
cord.
now
what
does
that
mean,
not
a
great
deal
to
me
if
any.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
think
that's
correct
mr.
justice
douglas,
right.
now
i
was
reading
from
the
slip
opinion
which
i
have
in
my
file.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
it
did
not.
and
we
contended
in
the
court
that
we
did
then
--
i
suppose
we
(inaudible)
again
i
have
funny
feeling
that
it
will
and
that
chief
justice
will
remember
(inaudible)
with
the
miranda
warnings
and
were
no
infections
here
with
regard
to
in
excess
of
one,
in
which
mr.
wells
mentioned
something
about
nobody
being
taken
before
a
magistrate,
but
the
miranda
warnings
were
properly
given
at
every
occasion
to
all
these
men.
you
got
everything
out
of
schneble,
you
got
nothing
out
out
of
snell.
i
really
have
met
a
lot
to
figure
how
snell's
alleged
statements
could
ever
put
schneble
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
i
guess
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
in
my
view,
you
would
--
i
hesitate
to
say
no.
i
would
like
to
but
you
would
have
to
stretch
with
a
great
deal.
you
would
have
to
engage
in
a
little
bit
of
activity
in
order
to
reach
one
before
you
could
start
on
the
other.
as
i
read
it,
no,
as
others
may
read
it,
of
course
he
could
conceivably
come
up
with
that.
but
as
i
understand
bruton,
if
we
are
talking
about
the
spectrum
of
not
being
able
to
cross-examine,
what
in
the
name
of
heaven
do
they
cross-examine
and
about
have
anything
to
do
with
the
crime.
if
that's
the
touchstone
of
bruton
and
i
think
it
was,
then
where
do
we
have
anything.
let's
assume
that
everything
that's
in
the
record
is
ironclad
true.
what
would
you
examine
him
about?
i
don't
know
how
articulated
a
lawyer
could
be,
what
could
he
say
to
him?
are
you
sure
you
took
this
route
down
here?
like
what
difference
does
it
make
as
to
the
criminal
involved.
now,
they
might
say
well,
are
you
sure
mr.
schneble
was
in
the
car?
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
not
more
than
you
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
i
don't
know
how
much.
i
guess
that
turns
a
great
deal
on
strategy
and
wisdom.
we
could
speculate
for
a
long
time
on
many
things
that
could
occur
and
yet
it
occurs
to
me
that
if
bruton
is
to
mean
anything,
it
has
to
mean
that
when
you
deprive
a
man
of
a
situation
in
a
joint
a
trial
where
you
cannot
cross-examine
an
individual,
then
you
have
done
something
to
him
which
he
can't
possibly
avoid
even
by
a
jury
instruction,
which
by
the
way
we
understand
are
a
little
less
than
compelling
in
most
instances
and
that's
why
you
reach
your
conclusion.
but
in
the
last
analysis,
when
the
court
got
what
it
did
from
you
on
remand,
it
occurs
to
me
that
they
treated
it
as
it
should
be
treated,
a
disaster
as
to
snell,
and
really
nothing
as
to
schneble
because
there
was
no
connection
between
anything
that
he
said
and
the
crime
which
involved
schneble
or
indeed
himself
and
i
think
that
the
matter
either
should
be
sent
back
as
improvidently
granted
or
affirmed
as
is.
thank
you.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
may
it
please
the
court.
i
was
hearing
some
of
the
questions
from
the
bench,
i
am
tempted
to
truly
cavalierly,
but
i
don't
mean
to
do
that
at
all.
we've
heard
a
long
recitation
here.
i
suspect
it
talks
around
much
of
what
he
should
be
saying
very
positively,
if
he
is
going
to
demonstrate
a
bruton
violation.
as
i
understand
the
court's
order,
that's
exactly
what
we're
here
for.
it
makes
reference
to
a
series
of
pages
of
testimony
wherein
your
supposed
to
find
this
implicating
testimony
that
did
so
much
harm
to
schneble.
i
have
three
pages
over
here
and
there
are
some
40
odd
pages
to
which
he
makes
reference.
i
read
it
again
last
night
and
if
it's
there,
then
thing
for
you
would
do
is
of
course
reverse
it.
but
if
you
find
anything
in
there
that
implicates
schneble
in
anyway,
i
got
these
line
to
heed
it.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
he
sure
did
not.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no.
now
i'll
tell
you
this.
obviously,
during
the
course
of
the
trial
it
developed
somewhere
along
the
line
that
these
two
men
were
in
the
car,
but
it
didn't
come
from
that
you
see.
it
came
from
schneble's
confession.
not
only
did
he
confess
in
great
detail,
but
he
took
them
to
where
the
body
was.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
oh!
yes.
no
question
about
that,
that’s
correct,
sure
they
are
and
obviously
all
you
got
to
do
is
have
maddock's
testimony
to
put
him
in
the
automobile.
what
they
did
was
they
took
a
route
from
new
orleans
along
the
coast,
all
the
way
down
to
key
west,
approximately,
i
would
say
11,
12
maybe
1300
miles.
somewhere
along
the
way,
this
woman
was
killed,
she
was
dumped
in
hillsborough
county
in
the
greater
tampa.
they
went
on
down
to
key
west,
came
back
up,
were
picked
up
in
west
palm
and
that's
when
this
series
of
events
occurred.
so
you
have
nothing
from
snell.
by
the
way,
here
in
the
(inaudible),
well
sure
of
that,
his
nick
name
is
lucky.
he
didn't
tell
them
anything.
no
complicity
on
his
part,
not
on
schneble's
part,
none
whatsoever.
this
is
what
he
said.
when
you
find
this
body
--
if
and
when
you
find
this
body,
you
will
find
a
polyethylene
cord
and
don't
overlook
the
obvious.
now
i
don't
know
what
that’s
supposed
to
do
to
schneble,
but
he
hadn’t
already
done
himself.
now
as
i
understood
bruton
and
i
think
everybody
else
does,
there
wasn't
any
questions,
i
represented
the
state,
when
you
remanded
this
matter
to
the
florida
supreme
court
and
the
position
i
am
taking
here
is
a
position
i
took
there.
we
agree
that
snell
suffered
under
schneble's
confession.
he
did
not
take
the
stand,
there
was
no
cross-examination,
but
a
clear
bruton
violation.
he
put
snell
in
the
bag
just
as
pretty,
as
you
please.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
i
do
not
quite
dicta,
mr.
justice
brennan.
it
really,
and
i
hope
they
forgive
me,
it
really
has
no
place
in
this.
they
reversed
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
they
do
say
that.
if
you
would
like
i
will
read
it
for
you.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
right.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
sure.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
yes
they
did.
now
the
part
that
you
may
recall
is
really
six
lines,
let
me
read
it
to
you.
i
am
reading
from
this
slip
opinion.
“in
as
much
if
there
was
no
prior
unconstitutional
confession
by
schneble,
as
in
bruton,
and
schneble's
confession
was
found
to
be
admissible,
we
again
affirm
conviction
in
schneble
v.
state
and
hold
that
conclusion
not
inconsistent
with
bruton.
the
authority
cited
by
the
supreme
court
of
united
states,
it
is
so
ordered.”
so
yes,
they
do,
and
no,
they
don't.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
i
do
to,
but
perhaps
not
as
much
as
do
you.
yeah,
i
was
there
and
i
remember
what
the
argument
was,
that's
no
good
to
you
because
you
don't
have
it
written,
i
understand
that.
and
yes,
put
cold
the
way
it
is
here
today.
you
have
the
transcript
from
the
first
proceeding,
by
the
way
before
you.
you
can
read
it
as
many
times
as
you
like
and
unless
you
have
some
sort
of
magic,
you
just
can't
find
any
implication
in
there.
now
whatever
the
reason,
let's
assume
they
have
reached
this
reason
or
rather
this
result
for
the
wrong
reason.
if
their
result
is
correct,
it
really
doesn't
make
any
difference.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
i
hope
when
the
internalizing
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes
sir,
exactly.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
to
begin
with
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
he
didn't
say
that.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no.
all
he
said
was
--
well,
actually
all
he
said
that's
not
true.
among
other
things
he
said,
you'll
find
that
my
fingerprints
are
only
in
the
front
seat.
now
either
by
casting
out
nines,
eliminations,
whichever
way
you
want,
if
they
were
found
together
the
presumption
has
to
follow
i
suppose,
that
the
other
person
was
in
the
back
seat.
but
he
never
mentioned
his
name
so
conceivably
there
could
have
been
somebody
else
in
there
don't
you
think.
now
i
don't
know
if
we
can
reach
back
geographically
and
both
historically
and
determine
that
because
they
were
found
in
the
car
in
west
palm
that
on
their
trip,
that
schneble
was
physically
in
the
back
seat.
if
he
was,
they
didn't
find
that
out
from
snell,
they
didn't
found
out
anything
from
him.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
collides
with
it.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
but
he
was
sitting
in
the
front.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
say
that's
colllidable
statement
you
see.
snell
is
a
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
as
i
recall
he
did.
no,
no,
no,
did
you
say
it
from
the
backseat?
no,
i
think
he
said
he
reached
over
from
the
front
and
did
it.
that's
my
recollection
of
it,
please
don't
hold
me
to
it.
i
haven't
gone
into
the
explicit
details
of
schneble's
confession
because
of
the
organic
position
i
took
based
on
your
request
here.
but
my
recollection
is
if
there
was
a
reach
over
in
the
strangulation
of
this
woman.
now
corpus
delicti
in
florida
three
things
in
a
murder
prosecution,
that
there
is
a
dead
body,
that
it
has
an
identity,
and
that
it
was
the
result
of
the
criminal
agency
of
another.
now
that
darn
sure
didn't
come
from
snell.
no
way,
as
i
read
anything
to
which
others
say
he
testified
to
them
or
gave
a
statement
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
oh!
yes.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
from
the
officer
who
testified
that
after
the
scene,
when
they
picked
them
up
on
this
alleged
--
well
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
did
have
a
light
violation
when
they
were
stooped
and
probably
the
testimony
will
reveal
that
there
was
some
confusion
as
to
allegedly
misunderstanding
what
the
officer
purported
them
to
do
when
he
stopped
them.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
alright
now,
then
the
officer
testified
that
schneble
told
him
that
he
was
a
hitchhiker
and
been
picked
up
by
this
man
on
his
way
out
of
the
keys
as
i
understand.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that
came
from
schneble,
never
from
snell.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
now
i
don't
know
that
it
makes
it
clear
that
he
wasn't
a
hitchhiker,
he
doesn't
mention
the
man's
name
at
all,
don't
you
see.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
oh!
i
would
think
that
it
would
mr.
justice
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no
i
understand,
if
that
were
the
case,
i
would
agree
that
there
is
at
least
something
here
that
ought
to
be
examined
at
least
more
closely,
but
that
isn't
so.
you
see
snell
never
[voice
overlap]
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
like
what?
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
but
that
came
from
schneble
you
see.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
now
we
are
talking
about
what
snell
says,
to
put
him
under
bruton,
i
tell
you
there
is
nothing.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
no,
i
means
yes
whichever
applies.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that's
correct.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
because
you
see
there
is
an
individual
in
the
car
but
never
mentions
him
by
name.
and
i
say,
that
if
you
are
going
to
find
out
that
it
was
schneble,
you
are
going
to
have
to
surmise
that
going
back
from
west
palm
to
key
west
all
the
way
back
up
florida’s
gulf
coast,
and
new
orleans
you
are
going
to
have
to
place
schneble
in
there,
based
on
snell's
testimony,
and
you
cannot
do
it.
because
he
denied
any
complicity
himself
and
he
certainly
never
mentioned
schneble.
all
he
said
was,
if
and
when
you
find
his
body
don't
overlook
the
obvious
and
there
will
be
a
polyethylene
cord.
now
what
does
that
mean,
not
a
great
deal
to
me
if
any.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
think
that's
correct
mr.
justice
douglas,
right.
now
i
was
reading
from
the
slip
opinion
which
i
have
in
my
file.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
it
did
not.
and
we
contended
in
the
court
that
we
did
then
--
i
suppose
we
(inaudible)
again
i
have
funny
feeling
that
it
will
and
that
chief
justice
will
remember
(inaudible)
with
the
miranda
warnings
and
were
no
infections
here
with
regard
to
in
excess
of
one,
in
which
mr.
wells
mentioned
something
about
nobody
being
taken
before
a
magistrate,
but
the
miranda
warnings
were
properly
given
at
every
occasion
to
all
these
men.
you
got
everything
out
of
schneble,
you
got
nothing
out
out
of
snell.
i
really
have
met
a
lot
to
figure
how
snell's
alleged
statements
could
ever
put
schneble
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
i
guess
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
in
my
view,
you
would
--
i
hesitate
to
say
no.
i
would
like
to
but
you
would
have
to
stretch
with
a
great
deal.
you
would
have
to
engage
in
a
little
bit
of
activity
in
order
to
reach
one
before
you
could
start
on
the
other.
as
i
read
it,
no,
as
others
may
read
it,
of
course
he
could
conceivably
come
up
with
that.
but
as
i
understand
bruton,
if
we
are
talking
about
the
spectrum
of
not
being
able
to
cross-examine,
what
in
the
name
of
heaven
do
they
cross-examine
and
about
have
anything
to
do
with
the
crime.
if
that's
the
touchstone
of
bruton
and
i
think
it
was,
then
where
do
we
have
anything.
let's
assume
that
everything
that's
in
the
record
is
ironclad
true.
what
would
you
examine
him
about?
i
don't
know
how
articulated
a
lawyer
could
be,
what
could
he
say
to
him?
are
you
sure
you
took
this
route
down
here?
like
what
difference
does
it
make
as
to
the
criminal
involved.
now,
they
might
say
well,
are
you
sure
mr.
schneble
was
in
the
car?
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
not
more
than
you
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
i
don't
know
how
much.
i
guess
that
turns
a
great
deal
on
strategy
and
wisdom.
we
could
speculate
for
a
long
time
on
many
things
that
could
occur
and
yet
it
occurs
to
me
that
if
bruton
is
to
mean
anything,
it
has
to
mean
that
when
you
deprive
a
man
of
a
situation
in
a
joint
a
trial
where
you
cannot
cross-examine
an
individual,
then
you
have
done
something
to
him
which
he
can't
possibly
avoid
even
by
a
jury
instruction,
which
by
the
way
we
understand
are
a
little
less
than
compelling
in
most
instances
and
that's
why
you
reach
your
conclusion.
but
in
the
last
analysis,
when
the
court
got
what
it
did
from
you
on
remand,
it
occurs
to
me
that
they
treated
it
as
it
should
be
treated,
a
disaster
as
to
snell,
and
really
nothing
as
to
schneble
because
there
was
no
connection
between
anything
that
he
said
and
the
crime
which
involved
schneble
or
indeed
himself
and
i
think
that
the
matter
either
should
be
sent
back
as
improvidently
granted
or
affirmed
as
is.
thank
you.
