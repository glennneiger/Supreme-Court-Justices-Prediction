justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
wells,
this
grant
of
certiorari
is
limited,
isn't
it
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
whether
the
conviction
was
in
violation
of
bruton?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
do
the
facts
that
you
were
reciting
bear
on
that
issue?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
question
is
as
i
understand
it
--
what
happened,
his
co-defendant
--
they
were
not
tried
together,
were
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see,
they
were
jointly
tried
and
handed
--
and
his
co-defendant's
confession,
as
well
as,
schneble's
own
confession.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
were
admitted,
isn't
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
his
statement
was
testified
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
that
statement
by
a
police
officer,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
statement
implicated
schneble?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
co-defendant
did
not
take
a
stand
and
therefore
not
cross
examined?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
on
that
basis,
you
are
claiming
a
violation
of
rules,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
know
if
you
can
get
to
that
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
i
understand
it
has
--
schneble,
bruton
(inaudible).
the
florida
supreme
court
held
that
bruton
didn't
apply
because
schneble's
own
confession
was
not
unconstitutionally
admitted,
was
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
why
did
the
florida
supreme
court
say
that
snell
was
entitled
to
a
reversal
based
on
bruton?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
he
implicated
snell?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
was
snell
implicating
schneble
as
well
as
schneble
implicating
snell?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
i
correctly
read
the
petition
of
the
florida
supreme
court
in
holding
that
scheneble
was
not
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
bruton
not
because
snell
hadn't
sufficiently
implicated
him,
but
rather
because
scheneble's
own
confession
was
not
an
unconstitutional
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
implicating
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
didn't
turn
it
on
harmless
error,
they
never
reached
the
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
wasn't
mr.
schneble
had
one
point
the
fact
that
he
had
strangled
the
lady
who
was
sitting
in
the
front
seat,
while
he
pressed
and
he
mingled
in
the
backseat,
strangled
with
this
cord,
was
it
is
something
about
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
was
now
told
(inaudible)
he
confirms
the
fact,
snell
did
that
schneble
was
sitting
in
the
backseat,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
as
far
as
there
is
any
(inaudible)
it
is
that
yates
saying
that
snell
had
put
schneble
in
the
backseat,
confirmed
the
story
that
schneble
himself
would
kill
her,
that
from
the
backseat
he
had
leaned
over
and
strangled
the
lady
sitting
in
front
of
him.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
there
is
anything
you
(inaudible)
the
point?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
because
that
was
admitted?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
was
the
ground
--
i
don't
have
the
opinion
here,
neither
of
you
cite
the
--
where
we
can
find
it,
and
i
recall
reading
the
last
spring.
i
thought
the
florida
supreme
court
while
finding
that
snell
was
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
bruton,
held
that
schneble
was
not
on
some
ground
related
to
the
validity
of
one
of
the
other
confessions.
do
you
recall
what
i
am
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
i
am
trying
to
say
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
i
recall
that
opinion,
they
do
not
rest
it
on
what
you
are
now
arguing
or
which
you
had
already
argued
before
that
court
mainly
that
nothing
that
was
testified
to
by
yates
or
anything
else
is
the
snell's
statement
in
anyway
prejudiced
schneble?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
you
are
telling
us?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yeah,
yeah.
now
what
i
am
suggesting
is
i
don't
recall
that
florida
supreme
court
rested
the
bruton
point
to
schneble
on
that
ground,
did
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
my
difficulty
with
that
is
that
i
just
--
i
had
trouble
reading
into
that.
now
that
what
they
are
saying
is
if
schneble
is
not
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
bruton
because
nothing
said
by
snell
in
anyway
is
implicated
or
prejudiced
schneble
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
any
event
i
gather
what
the
state
is
arguing
to
us
today,
is
if
we
look
at
the
record
we'll
conclude
ourselves
that
nothing
testified
to
in
the
way
of
statement
by
snell,
in
anyway
implicated
or
prejudiced
with
schneble,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
your
submission.
