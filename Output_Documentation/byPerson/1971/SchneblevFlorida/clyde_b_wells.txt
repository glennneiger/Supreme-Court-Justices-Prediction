mr.
clyde
b.
wells
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
the
case
of
donald
felix
schneble
versus
the
state
of
florida
and
i
am
here
representing
the
petitioner,
donald
felix
schneble.
i
would
like
to
give
you
a
little
background
on
this
case.
the
crime
was
committed
in
july
of
1965.
the
defendant
and
his
codefendant
edward
frank
snell,
was
picked
up
several
days
after
the
alleged
commission
of
the
crime.
they
were
lodged
in
the
palm
beach
county
jail.
the
crime
allegedly
occurred
in
walton
county,
florida,
several
hundred
miles
from
where
they
were
picked
up.
they
were
charged
initially
with
a
traffic
violation,
the
driver
of
the
car,
the
co-defendant,
snell.
mr.
schneble
was
charged
with
vagrancy
at
that
time.
he
was
taken
to
court
on
the
morning
after
he
was
picked
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
sentenced
for
vagrancy,
given
a
24-hour
sentence
and
given
credit
for
time
served
which
would
have
started
his
time
at
5
a.m.
in
that
morning.
during
the
course
of
the
day,
blood
was
found
in
the
area
of
the
front
seat
of
the
car
on
the
right
side
and
other
damaging
evidence
against
the
defendant
and
his
codefendant.
and
so
the
following
day
some
six
or
eight
--
six,
five
or
six
hours
after
the
defendant
schneble’s
sentence
had
expired,
he
was
taken
back
before
the
same
judge
and
given
an
additional
sentence
of
15
days,
given
the
credit
for
time
served
to
allow
the
authorities
to
investigate
the
evidence
that
they
found
in
the
vehicle.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
yes
sir.
it
was
--
the
previous
sentence
of
24
hours
was
withdrawn
or
vacated
and
a
new
sentence
was
imposed
after
the
expiration
of
the
24-hour
sentence.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
yes
sir.
then
from
that
point
the
defendant,
schneble,
was
taken
from
the
palm
beach
county
jail
by
two
detectives,
haroun
(ph)
and
hailey
(ph)
and
they
were
his
constant
companions
for
a
period
of
time,
ranging
from
the
testimony
from
48
or
40
to
60
hours.
during
that
period
of
time
the
detectives
hailey
(ph)
and
haroun
carried
him
to
three
different
jails.
they
carried
him
to
an
airport
where
they
kept
him
for
three
hours
and
questioned
him.
they
had
a
fellow
policeman
come
up
behind
him
at
a
high
rate
of
speed
and
throw
firecrackers
out
and
harassed
the
defendant
and
scared
him.
they
told
him
that
or
suggested
to
him
that
his
codefendant
snell
had
put
a
price
of
$5,000.00
on
his
head.
they
walked
out
of
the
jail
with
him
with
a
cop
vest
to
be
sure
nobody
would
shoot
him
on
the
way
out
and
kept
him
under
constant
harassments,
surveillance
for
this
period
of
40
to
60
hours,
they
even
put
a
detective
in
the
cell
next
to
him
to
keep
him
awake
and
harass
him
during
the
day
time
on
one
occasion
while
they
rested.
after
some
40
to
60
hours
of
this
type
of
treatment,
the
defendant,
schneble,
made
a
statement
to
him.
during
this
same
period
of
time
the
defendant
snell
was
being
questioned
by
other
officers
and
he
made
certain
limited
statements
against
his
interest
and
against
the
interest
of
both
of
them
which
was
also
introduced
at
the
trial.
now,
these
defendants
were
then
brought
back
to
walton
county,
florida
after
the
body
had
been
discovered
as
a
result
of
mr.
schneble’s
statement
and
there
they
were
indicted
by
a
grand
jury.
the
grand
jury
returned
separate
indictments
against
these
two
defendants,
but
upon
the
--
and
i
might
add
at
that
grand
jury
session,
there
was
a
non-authorized
person
in
the
grand
jury
room,
in
that
a
civil
case
was
being
tried
at
the
same
time
and
a
witness
in
one
of
the
civil
cases
wound
up
in
the
grand
jury
room
and
sat
there
all
afternoon
during
the
deliberation
with
the
grand
jury.
a
hearing
was
held
on
this
and
the
trial
judge
determined
that
there
was
nothing
improper
or
not
improper
that
--
so
that
the
indictment
should
be
quashed.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
that
was
from
the
statements
made
by
the
defendant,
schneble
after
some
40
to
60
hours
of
continued
--
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
the
only
statement
that
had
come
from
snell
was
that
he
had
told
them
the
route
they
had
taken.
he
had
told
them
that
when
they
found
her,
she
was
--
well,
i
do
not
know
he
--
how
he
said
he
found,
but
the
lieutenant
larry
yates
(ph)
had
questioned
him
and
stated
that
he
--
that
she
had
been
sitting
in
the
right
front
of
the
car
and
that
schneble,
the
defendant
was
seated
in
the
backseat
and
snell
was
driving
and
he
had
choked
her
with
a
cord
and
snell
made
the
statement
to
him
that
he
had
painted
a
hypothetical
of
actually
what
happened
and
when
they
found
her
to
do
not
overlook
the
obvious,
that
was
his
statement
to
him.
he
also
told
them
the
route
they
took
when
they
left
new
orleans
on
their
way
to
panama
city
and
then
on
down
to
tampa.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
continuing
where
we
left
off
yesterday
afternoon
into
the
case
of
schneble
versus
florida,
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
the
development
of
my
background
on
the
case.
that
at
the
time
the
defendant
schneble
or
petitioner
schneble
was
taken
back
over
to
the
court
of
record
of
palm
beach
county
for
a
resentencing,
he
at
that
time
requested
the
services
of
a
public
defendant
as
evident
by
the
deposition
you
have
in
the
record,
but
because
--
apparently
because
the
public
defendant
determined
that
he
was
only
charged
with
vagrancy
at
that
time,
the
services
were
not
made
available
to
him.
i
want
to
further
point
out
to
the
court
that
neither
the
petitioner
nor
his
co-defendant
were
taken
before
a
committing
magistrate
on
the
charge
of
murder
or
unlawful
homicide,
until
july
23
or
thereafter,
even
though
they
were
arrested
on
july
4
immediately.
although,
i
know
that
that
in
and
off
itself
is
not
favorable
to
their
--
the
charges
against
them,
and
certainly
it
is
a
circumstance
to
be
considered
in
looking
at
the
overall
circumstances
of
this
case.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
yes
sir.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
yes
sir
--
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
it's
not
directly
on
the
issue,
justice
brennan
but
on
the
overall
background,
i
am
trying
to
just
give
you
an
overall
background
of
the
case
for
this
(inaudible)
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
yes
sir,
they
were
jointly
tried.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
yes
sir.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
i
would
not
characterize
the
co-defendant
as
a
confession
for
whatever
statement
were
made
--
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
yeah.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
yes
sir
--
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
yes
sir.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
that
is
correct.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
yeah.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
alright.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
we
had
as
to
the
defendant
snell,
the
co-defendant
as
i
said,
he
made
no
outright
confession
such
as
we
have
with
the
petitioner
schneble,
but
from
the
beginning
of
their
arrest
by
trooper
maddock
(ph),
the
highway
patrolman,
trooper
maddock
was
allowed
freely
to
testify
about
the
statements
made
to
him
by
the
defendant
snell
relating
to
the
absence
of
a
driving
license,
statement
as
to
the
car
that
defendant
snell
was
in
possession
of,
statements
as
to
the
gun
that
he
had
in
his
possession
and
throughout
maddock's
testimony,
sprinkled
with
statements
made
by
the
co-defendant
snell,
maddock
being
the
highway
patrolmen
that
arrested
them
initially
on
the
faulty
taillight
charge
or
pit
stopped
them
for
that
--
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
yes,
well
certain
of
them
did
and
certain
of
--they
were
inconsistent
statements.
one
started
off
he
said,
he
picked
him
up
or
the
hitchhiker
and
later
on,
he
told
some
officers
that
they
had
left
all
in
together
but
they
were
--
snell
made
inconsistent
statements
through
various
people.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
he
told
one
of
the
officers
and
that
was
lieutenant
yates
of
the
palm
beach
sheriff
department
that
schneble
was
riding
in
the
back
seat
of
the
car
--
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
yes
sir
and
i
pointed
out
that
these
statements
were
allowed
in
the
evidence
without
the
trial
judge
even
giving
the
jury
any
cautionary
instructions
about
they
were
not
to
be
used
against
the
defendant
schneble.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
no
sir,
i
wouldn't
say
that.
the
statement
to
lieutenant
yates
indicated
that,
i
mean,
he
didn't
deny
the
crime.
lieutenant
yates
testified
that
he
asked
him,
did
you
and
schneble
or
did
schneble
killed?
he
didn't
even
respond.
of
course,
the
absence
of
a
response
in
my
opinion
would
be
an
admission
that
there
was
--
that
she
had
been
killed.
and
then
he
asked
for
the
seating
arrangement
and
he
was
told
the
seating
arrangement
by
the
defendant
snell
and
snell
went
further
and
said,
“you
will
--
when
you
find
the
body
you'll
find
a
polyethylene
cord,
same(inaudible)
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
snell
was
reversed
on
bruton.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
no
sir,
it
was
not
--
i
contended
my
client
made
an
involuntary
statement
but
the
court
didn't
entertain
that.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
yes.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
well,
when
the
first
time
this
case
came
up,
both
cases
were
reversed
and
sent
back
to
the
florida
supreme
court.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
yes,
sir
and
sent
back
to
the
florida
supreme
court.
i
don't
believe
it
was
vacated.
they
were
just
sent
back
to
florida
supreme
court
for
further
proceeding
in
light
of
bruton.
the
florida
supreme
court
then
reconsidered
the
cases
and
vacated
the
judgment
asked
to
snell,
affirmed
to
schneble
and
from
that
we
took
certain
facts
up
here.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
yes
sir,
that
well
--
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
because
schneble
made
more
statements,
he
talked
more.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
yes
sir.
well,
he
implicated
--
yes
sir
he
implicated
both
of
them
and
our
contend
that
snell
did
also.
but
--
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
yes,
that
he
was
put
more
on
schneble
and
he
did
most
of
the
talking.
they
got
the
gist
of
the
story
out
of
schneble.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
well,
probably
that
it
was
a
holding,
i
mean
that
was
a
rationale.
i
didn't
understand
it
to
mean
that.
i
think,
they
just
found
that
snell
didn't
make
any
statements
--
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
sufficiently
strong
to
implicate
or
that
schneble's
own
confession
standing
alone
would
have
been
sufficient.
but
--
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
no,
no
they
did
not.
because
it's
my
position
that
although
the
statements
made
by
a
defendant
snell
were
not
as
strong
as
those
made
by
the
defendant
schneble,
they
stood
as
collaborating
testimony
and
certainly
without
that
collaboration,
the
state
would
have
been
in
a
much
weaker
position
and
my
client
would
have
been
in
a
much
stronger
position.
of
course,
we
had
the
testimony
of
the
officers
indicating
that
they
would
have
recommended
some
kind
of
a
deal
for
my
client
for
his
co-operation,
but
the
jury
didn't
find
that
which
is
evident
to
mean
that
they
made
my
client
stand
in
the
same
shoes
as
the
defendant
snell.
so
certainly,
we'd
have
to
say
that
my
client
was
prejudiced
by
the
very
presence
of
snell,
by
his
appearance,
his
statements,
he
demeanor.
all
of
these
things
had
a
bearing
on
it
and
would
have
entitled
him
to
the
protection
of
the
bruton
decision.
there
is
just
no
question
but
that
this
gave
the
state
a
much
stronger
case
to
have
both
of
them
standing
together.
i
think,
this
is
quite
evident
for
the
fact
is
they
were
separately
embodied
and
on
the
motion
of
the
state,
they
were
tried
jointly
which
indicated
to
me
that
they
felt
like
that
case
would
be
much
stronger
against
each
of
the
defendant's
by
having
them
jointly
tried.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
yes.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
i
treated
it
is
as
a
coerced
confession
and
i
dwelt
at
length
on
the
time
that
was
consumed
in
securing
it,
and
the
credibility
that
should
be
given
to
it
as
a
result
of
that,
and
i
urged
the
jury
to
consider
it
as
an
involuntary
confession.
the
judge
ruled
that
it
was
admissible
for
the
jury's
considerations,
and
therefore
the
jury
had
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
was
coerced
or
not,
and
so
the
thrust
of
my
argument
was
on
that
basis
that
it
was
coerced
confession
and
subject
to
undue
influence
because
of
some
of
these
things
that
i
have
mentioned
to
you
yesterday
afternoon.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
obviously.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
sir.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
i
was
not
arguing
snell's
case.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
well,
i
don't
recall
any
comments
that
i
made
on
the
defendant's
snell's
statement
at
that
time
because
defendant
snell
was
represented
by
counsel
and
of
course,
i
was
primarily
pleading
to
--
for
my
own
man,
and
to
to
try
to
get
him
off
with
his
life,
basically
that's
what
my
argument
was.
i
aimed
that
when
i
made
it
to
the
jury.
of
course,
i
treated
it
as
i
recall
that
each
one
should
stand
on
his
own
feet
and
the
jury
should
measure
them
separately,
not
collectively.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
i
specifically
recall
him
mentioning
the
statement
to
lieutenant
yates
about
the
positions
in
the
car,
i
think
he
mentioned
the
route
they
took
and
the
polyethylene
cord
and
would
be
found
with
the
body
and
do
not
overlook
the
obvious.
i
recall
a
prosecutor
making
a
strong
point
of
that,
but
now
the
extent
beyond
that
to
which
he
went
i
am
not
sufficiently
refreshed
to
tell
you.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
yes
sir,
that's
true.
that
was
yes
to
the
statement
that
he
did
that
in
--
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
yes,
sir
and
schneble
also
told
them
that,
he
strangled
with
a
cord
and
then
that
defendant
snell
took
pistol
and
shot
her
in
her
head.
now
there
was
further
testimony
from,
i
believe
it
was
expert
leslie
smith,
ballistic
expert
to
testify
that
the
gun
that
was
taken
off
the
defendant's
snell
was
the
murder
--
was
probable,
highly
probable,
that
was
his
testimony,
he
could
not
positively
identify
it,
but
he
said
it
was
highly
probable,
the
reason
he
couldn't
possibly
test
that
was
because
--
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
yes,
sir
and
further.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
well
--
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
that
is
the
strongest,
but
justice
brennan
i
don't
concede
that
that
is
the
only
way
that
(inaudible)
would
apply,
because
he
also
told
lieutenant
yates
about
the
route
they
had
taken
from
new
orleans,
that
schneble
was
in
the
car
from
new
orleans
along
with
the
girl.
he
also
told
them
that
--
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
yes,
sir.
now
there
were
some
weak
testimony
from
new
orleans
but
the
girl
that
saw
--
the
girl
with
these
two
boys,
but
she
didn't
see
them
leave,
so
i
think
that
i
am
correct
in
saying
that
the
only
testimony
connecting
or
putting
them
two
in
the
car
was
from
the
two
defendant's
saying.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
no
sir.
there
has
to
be
proof
of
the
corpus
delicti
independent
of
the
statement
which
we
contend
would
not
be
there
without
the
statement
of
the
--
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
of
schneble
and/or
snell,
yes
sir,
one
or
the
other.
of
course
you
can't
use
the
confession
of
the
defendant
in
proving
the
corpus
delicti.
it's
got
to
be
proven
independently.
so
i
say
that
you
cannot
in
this
case
use
the
testimony
of
the
defendant
snell
either
--
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
sir?
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
that
a
crime
was
committed
by
the
criminal
agency
of
another,
that's
generally
what
i
have
been
--
there
has
been
a
crime
committed
and
it
was
by
the
criminal
agency
of
another
and
without
the
statement
of
these
two
defendants,
either
or
both
of
them
--
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
it
is
my
position
that
in
that
situation
there
never
would
have
been
a
corpus
delicti
proven
and
that
they
never
have
gotten
to
the
--
they
never
would
have
gotten
to
the
confession
stage,
they
never
would
have
gotten
it
and
therefore
there
could
not
have
been
a
conviction.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
not
without
proving
a
corpus
delicti
independent
of
this
thing.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
but
you
see
without
his
statement,
there
would
have
been
no
body.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
without
defendant
schneble's
statement.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
because
i
keep
going
back
to
this
corpus
delicti
and
because
of
that
requirement
i
would
say
no,
they
could
not
have
done.
because
--
i
would
say
that
they
would
not
have
gotten
to
the
confession
of
schneble,
had
it
not
been
for
the
allowing
of
the
statement
to
the
court.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
they
were
introduced
to
both
to
corroborate
each
other
and
the
strengthen
the
position
of
the
state,
that's
my
position.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
no
sir,
and
i'll
tell
you
why.
by
the
time
we
had
gotten
to
the
part
where
we
had
argued
till
we
were
blue
in
the
face,
we
had
the
jury
out,
we
had
taken
extensive
testimony
on
schneble,
his
testimony
--
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
yes,
that's
correct
and
there
--
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
my
comparison
--
i
have
taken
the
position
that
these
limiting
instructions
are
not
--
have
never
been
introduced.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
yes,
and
therefore
i
saw
no
reason
to
suggest
that.
i
would
like
to
take
five
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
yes.
justice
rehnquist,
you
asked
question
about
the
body
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
that,
that
those
who
viewed
the
body
would
view
it
as
a
result
of
the
confession
and
therefore
would
be
the
fruits
of
the
confession
and
could
not
be
considered
as
part
of
the
corpus
delicti
in
my
position
of
the
case.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
i
have
that
in
my
hand,
i
was
going
to
read
it
to
the
court
before
it
would
permit.
this
is
lieutenant
yates
testifying.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
page
409,
yes.
and
he
was
talking
to
--
lieutenant
yates
was
questioning
snell,
that
what
did
you
say
in
response
to
that?
during
the
time,
that
time
he
told
me
that
i
had
during
the
previous
interview
painted
a
hypothetical
picture
of
what
had
happened.
i
asked
him
what
he
meant
by
this.
he
said,
that
during
the
processing
of
the
automobile
that
there
was
a
piece
of
polyethylene
line
that
had
been
found
in
this
automobile
and
he
said,
if
and
when
they
find
this
body,
look
for
a
piece
of
polyethylene
line
and
don't
overlook
the
obvious.
did
he
later
stated
where
each
of
these
people
had
been
riding,
that
was
lieutenant
yates
question.
answer,
yes
sir.
he
stated
that
if
they
processed
this
automobile
for
fingerprints,
that
they
would
not
find
his
prints
present
anywhere
in
the
automobile,
except
in
the
drivers
area,
that
schneble
had
occupied
the
rear
seat
of
the
automobile
and
he
had
occupied
the
driver's
seat.
now
that
is
where
he
made
the
mistake,
to
put
them
in
the
back
seat,
(inaudible)
than
that.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
yes
sir,
lieutenant
yates
used
the
name
schneble
as
–
quoting
snell.
mr.
georgieff
indicated
that
in
schneble's
confession,
he
never
admitted
he
was
in
the
back
seat.
but
on
page
280
of
the
transcript
you
will
find
that
he
did
admit
that
he
was
in
the
back
seat
and
he
answer
to
a
question,
after
they
went
for
a
walk
on
the
beach
talking
about
snell
and
to
the
victim.
he
said,
they
came
down
the
road
and
when
they
stopped,
snell
dropped
the
plastic
cord
into
his
lap
and
motioned
with
his
hand
and
he
said
at
that
point,
he
put
the
cord
around
her
neck
and
started
to
squeeze.
now
i
have
got
the
impression,
down
the
road
in
the
automobile.
he
said,
he
pulled
as
hard
as
he
could
and
held
as
long
as
he
could,
but
she
was
a
good
fat
woman
and
gave
out
and
he
relaxed.
so,
i
feel
like
there
is
other
places
in
the
testimony
where
schneble
admitted
he
was
in
the
back
seat,
but
that
points
out
for
the
purpose
of
argument
what
i
am
trying
to
show
you.
now
i
would
further
say
that
the
corroboration
of
the
defendant
snell's
testimony
is
the
main
trust
of
this
bruton
argument
in
this
case,
that
i
am
here
on
today.
not
yet
these
two
things
that
i
have
pointed
out
to
you,
but
the
whole
bit
from
start
to
finish,
the
testimony
of
the
trooper,
the
testimony
of
the
fbi
agent
kellogg
where
he
is
quoting
snell
--
trooper
maddock
is
quoting
snell,
lieutenant
yates
is
quoting
snell,
all
of
these
things
corroborate
the
testimony,
the
confession
that's
given
by
the
petitioner
schneble.
i
also
want
to
point
out
to
you
that
i
feel
that
this
harm
that's
done
in
these
situations
is
the
reason
for
the
rule
in
bruton.
it
was
also
the
reason
for
the
criminal
rule
14
of
the
federal
rule
of
criminal
procedures
which
i
recognize
is
not
binding
on
the
state
of
florida,
but
they
are
inductive
of
the
opinion
that
exist
with
regard
to
what
constitution
violation
of
a
person's
rights.
and
so
when
you
put
these
two
cases
together,
put
them
in
the
same
(inaudible)
and
require,
--
understand
together,
fall
together,
certainly
there
is
no
way
that
you
can
say
that
the
defendant
schneble
was
not
prejudiced
by
the
defendant's
snell
presence
in
that
courtroom,
being
tried
in
the
joint
trial.
and
although
it's
a
matter
of
degree
i
concede
that
it
is
a
matter
of
degree
but
certainly
he
was
prejudiced
by
snell's
presence
there,
just
the
same
as
snell
was
prejudiced
by
schneble’s
presence
there.
and
we
are
arguing
about
the
question
of
degree
and
that
should
not
be
the
controlling
factor
because
if
schneble
would
have
come
out
of
there
on
his
own
with
a
life
sentence
whereas
by
standing
with
snell,
he
got
the
death
sentence,
then
he
has
been
prejudiced
in
this
instance
because
otherwise
he'd
be
walking
out
with
his
life
not
in
jeopardy
as
he
stands
today.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
no,
well,
he
entered
a
plea
to
a
manslaughter
was
given
five
years
and
time
to
--
credit
for
time
served
and
he's
on
the
streets
now,
he's
out.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
the
case
of
donald
felix
schneble
versus
the
state
of
florida
and
i
am
here
representing
the
petitioner,
donald
felix
schneble.
i
would
like
to
give
you
a
little
background
on
this
case.
the
crime
was
committed
in
july
of
1965.
the
defendant
and
his
codefendant
edward
frank
snell,
was
picked
up
several
days
after
the
alleged
commission
of
the
crime.
they
were
lodged
in
the
palm
beach
county
jail.
the
crime
allegedly
occurred
in
walton
county,
florida,
several
hundred
miles
from
where
they
were
picked
up.
they
were
charged
initially
with
a
traffic
violation,
the
driver
of
the
car,
the
co-defendant,
snell.
mr.
schneble
was
charged
with
vagrancy
at
that
time.
he
was
taken
to
court
on
the
morning
after
he
was
picked
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
sentenced
for
vagrancy,
given
a
24-hour
sentence
and
given
credit
for
time
served
which
would
have
started
his
time
at
5
a.m.
in
that
morning.
during
the
course
of
the
day,
blood
was
found
in
the
area
of
the
front
seat
of
the
car
on
the
right
side
and
other
damaging
evidence
against
the
defendant
and
his
codefendant.
and
so
the
following
day
some
six
or
eight
--
six,
five
or
six
hours
after
the
defendant
schneble’s
sentence
had
expired,
he
was
taken
back
before
the
same
judge
and
given
an
additional
sentence
of
15
days,
given
the
credit
for
time
served
to
allow
the
authorities
to
investigate
the
evidence
that
they
found
in
the
vehicle.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
yes
sir.
it
was
--
the
previous
sentence
of
24
hours
was
withdrawn
or
vacated
and
a
new
sentence
was
imposed
after
the
expiration
of
the
24-hour
sentence.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
yes
sir.
then
from
that
point
the
defendant,
schneble,
was
taken
from
the
palm
beach
county
jail
by
two
detectives,
haroun
(ph)
and
hailey
(ph)
and
they
were
his
constant
companions
for
a
period
of
time,
ranging
from
the
testimony
from
48
or
40
to
60
hours.
during
that
period
of
time
the
detectives
hailey
(ph)
and
haroun
carried
him
to
three
different
jails.
they
carried
him
to
an
airport
where
they
kept
him
for
three
hours
and
questioned
him.
they
had
a
fellow
policeman
come
up
behind
him
at
a
high
rate
of
speed
and
throw
firecrackers
out
and
harassed
the
defendant
and
scared
him.
they
told
him
that
or
suggested
to
him
that
his
codefendant
snell
had
put
a
price
of
$5,000.00
on
his
head.
they
walked
out
of
the
jail
with
him
with
a
cop
vest
to
be
sure
nobody
would
shoot
him
on
the
way
out
and
kept
him
under
constant
harassments,
surveillance
for
this
period
of
40
to
60
hours,
they
even
put
a
detective
in
the
cell
next
to
him
to
keep
him
awake
and
harass
him
during
the
day
time
on
one
occasion
while
they
rested.
after
some
40
to
60
hours
of
this
type
of
treatment,
the
defendant,
schneble,
made
a
statement
to
him.
during
this
same
period
of
time
the
defendant
snell
was
being
questioned
by
other
officers
and
he
made
certain
limited
statements
against
his
interest
and
against
the
interest
of
both
of
them
which
was
also
introduced
at
the
trial.
now,
these
defendants
were
then
brought
back
to
walton
county,
florida
after
the
body
had
been
discovered
as
a
result
of
mr.
schneble’s
statement
and
there
they
were
indicted
by
a
grand
jury.
the
grand
jury
returned
separate
indictments
against
these
two
defendants,
but
upon
the
--
and
i
might
add
at
that
grand
jury
session,
there
was
a
non-authorized
person
in
the
grand
jury
room,
in
that
a
civil
case
was
being
tried
at
the
same
time
and
a
witness
in
one
of
the
civil
cases
wound
up
in
the
grand
jury
room
and
sat
there
all
afternoon
during
the
deliberation
with
the
grand
jury.
a
hearing
was
held
on
this
and
the
trial
judge
determined
that
there
was
nothing
improper
or
not
improper
that
--
so
that
the
indictment
should
be
quashed.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
that
was
from
the
statements
made
by
the
defendant,
schneble
after
some
40
to
60
hours
of
continued
--
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
the
only
statement
that
had
come
from
snell
was
that
he
had
told
them
the
route
they
had
taken.
he
had
told
them
that
when
they
found
her,
she
was
--
well,
i
do
not
know
he
--
how
he
said
he
found,
but
the
lieutenant
larry
yates
(ph)
had
questioned
him
and
stated
that
he
--
that
she
had
been
sitting
in
the
right
front
of
the
car
and
that
schneble,
the
defendant
was
seated
in
the
backseat
and
snell
was
driving
and
he
had
choked
her
with
a
cord
and
snell
made
the
statement
to
him
that
he
had
painted
a
hypothetical
of
actually
what
happened
and
when
they
found
her
to
do
not
overlook
the
obvious,
that
was
his
statement
to
him.
he
also
told
them
the
route
they
took
when
they
left
new
orleans
on
their
way
to
panama
city
and
then
on
down
to
tampa.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
continuing
where
we
left
off
yesterday
afternoon
into
the
case
of
schneble
versus
florida,
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
the
development
of
my
background
on
the
case.
that
at
the
time
the
defendant
schneble
or
petitioner
schneble
was
taken
back
over
to
the
court
of
record
of
palm
beach
county
for
a
resentencing,
he
at
that
time
requested
the
services
of
a
public
defendant
as
evident
by
the
deposition
you
have
in
the
record,
but
because
--
apparently
because
the
public
defendant
determined
that
he
was
only
charged
with
vagrancy
at
that
time,
the
services
were
not
made
available
to
him.
i
want
to
further
point
out
to
the
court
that
neither
the
petitioner
nor
his
co-defendant
were
taken
before
a
committing
magistrate
on
the
charge
of
murder
or
unlawful
homicide,
until
july
23
or
thereafter,
even
though
they
were
arrested
on
july
4
immediately.
although,
i
know
that
that
in
and
off
itself
is
not
favorable
to
their
--
the
charges
against
them,
and
certainly
it
is
a
circumstance
to
be
considered
in
looking
at
the
overall
circumstances
of
this
case.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
yes
sir.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
yes
sir
--
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
it's
not
directly
on
the
issue,
justice
brennan
but
on
the
overall
background,
i
am
trying
to
just
give
you
an
overall
background
of
the
case
for
this
(inaudible)
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
yes
sir,
they
were
jointly
tried.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
yes
sir.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
i
would
not
characterize
the
co-defendant
as
a
confession
for
whatever
statement
were
made
--
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
yeah.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
yes
sir
--
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
yes
sir.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
that
is
correct.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
yeah.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
alright.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
we
had
as
to
the
defendant
snell,
the
co-defendant
as
i
said,
he
made
no
outright
confession
such
as
we
have
with
the
petitioner
schneble,
but
from
the
beginning
of
their
arrest
by
trooper
maddock
(ph),
the
highway
patrolman,
trooper
maddock
was
allowed
freely
to
testify
about
the
statements
made
to
him
by
the
defendant
snell
relating
to
the
absence
of
a
driving
license,
statement
as
to
the
car
that
defendant
snell
was
in
possession
of,
statements
as
to
the
gun
that
he
had
in
his
possession
and
throughout
maddock's
testimony,
sprinkled
with
statements
made
by
the
co-defendant
snell,
maddock
being
the
highway
patrolmen
that
arrested
them
initially
on
the
faulty
taillight
charge
or
pit
stopped
them
for
that
--
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
yes,
well
certain
of
them
did
and
certain
of
--they
were
inconsistent
statements.
one
started
off
he
said,
he
picked
him
up
or
the
hitchhiker
and
later
on,
he
told
some
officers
that
they
had
left
all
in
together
but
they
were
--
snell
made
inconsistent
statements
through
various
people.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
he
told
one
of
the
officers
and
that
was
lieutenant
yates
of
the
palm
beach
sheriff
department
that
schneble
was
riding
in
the
back
seat
of
the
car
--
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
yes
sir
and
i
pointed
out
that
these
statements
were
allowed
in
the
evidence
without
the
trial
judge
even
giving
the
jury
any
cautionary
instructions
about
they
were
not
to
be
used
against
the
defendant
schneble.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
no
sir,
i
wouldn't
say
that.
the
statement
to
lieutenant
yates
indicated
that,
i
mean,
he
didn't
deny
the
crime.
lieutenant
yates
testified
that
he
asked
him,
did
you
and
schneble
or
did
schneble
killed?
he
didn't
even
respond.
of
course,
the
absence
of
a
response
in
my
opinion
would
be
an
admission
that
there
was
--
that
she
had
been
killed.
and
then
he
asked
for
the
seating
arrangement
and
he
was
told
the
seating
arrangement
by
the
defendant
snell
and
snell
went
further
and
said,
“you
will
--
when
you
find
the
body
you'll
find
a
polyethylene
cord,
same(inaudible)
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
snell
was
reversed
on
bruton.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
no
sir,
it
was
not
--
i
contended
my
client
made
an
involuntary
statement
but
the
court
didn't
entertain
that.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
yes.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
well,
when
the
first
time
this
case
came
up,
both
cases
were
reversed
and
sent
back
to
the
florida
supreme
court.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
yes,
sir
and
sent
back
to
the
florida
supreme
court.
i
don't
believe
it
was
vacated.
they
were
just
sent
back
to
florida
supreme
court
for
further
proceeding
in
light
of
bruton.
the
florida
supreme
court
then
reconsidered
the
cases
and
vacated
the
judgment
asked
to
snell,
affirmed
to
schneble
and
from
that
we
took
certain
facts
up
here.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
yes
sir,
that
well
--
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
because
schneble
made
more
statements,
he
talked
more.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
yes
sir.
well,
he
implicated
--
yes
sir
he
implicated
both
of
them
and
our
contend
that
snell
did
also.
but
--
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
yes,
that
he
was
put
more
on
schneble
and
he
did
most
of
the
talking.
they
got
the
gist
of
the
story
out
of
schneble.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
well,
probably
that
it
was
a
holding,
i
mean
that
was
a
rationale.
i
didn't
understand
it
to
mean
that.
i
think,
they
just
found
that
snell
didn't
make
any
statements
--
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
sufficiently
strong
to
implicate
or
that
schneble's
own
confession
standing
alone
would
have
been
sufficient.
but
--
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
no,
no
they
did
not.
because
it's
my
position
that
although
the
statements
made
by
a
defendant
snell
were
not
as
strong
as
those
made
by
the
defendant
schneble,
they
stood
as
collaborating
testimony
and
certainly
without
that
collaboration,
the
state
would
have
been
in
a
much
weaker
position
and
my
client
would
have
been
in
a
much
stronger
position.
of
course,
we
had
the
testimony
of
the
officers
indicating
that
they
would
have
recommended
some
kind
of
a
deal
for
my
client
for
his
co-operation,
but
the
jury
didn't
find
that
which
is
evident
to
mean
that
they
made
my
client
stand
in
the
same
shoes
as
the
defendant
snell.
so
certainly,
we'd
have
to
say
that
my
client
was
prejudiced
by
the
very
presence
of
snell,
by
his
appearance,
his
statements,
he
demeanor.
all
of
these
things
had
a
bearing
on
it
and
would
have
entitled
him
to
the
protection
of
the
bruton
decision.
there
is
just
no
question
but
that
this
gave
the
state
a
much
stronger
case
to
have
both
of
them
standing
together.
i
think,
this
is
quite
evident
for
the
fact
is
they
were
separately
embodied
and
on
the
motion
of
the
state,
they
were
tried
jointly
which
indicated
to
me
that
they
felt
like
that
case
would
be
much
stronger
against
each
of
the
defendant's
by
having
them
jointly
tried.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
yes.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
i
treated
it
is
as
a
coerced
confession
and
i
dwelt
at
length
on
the
time
that
was
consumed
in
securing
it,
and
the
credibility
that
should
be
given
to
it
as
a
result
of
that,
and
i
urged
the
jury
to
consider
it
as
an
involuntary
confession.
the
judge
ruled
that
it
was
admissible
for
the
jury's
considerations,
and
therefore
the
jury
had
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
was
coerced
or
not,
and
so
the
thrust
of
my
argument
was
on
that
basis
that
it
was
coerced
confession
and
subject
to
undue
influence
because
of
some
of
these
things
that
i
have
mentioned
to
you
yesterday
afternoon.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
obviously.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
sir.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
i
was
not
arguing
snell's
case.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
well,
i
don't
recall
any
comments
that
i
made
on
the
defendant's
snell's
statement
at
that
time
because
defendant
snell
was
represented
by
counsel
and
of
course,
i
was
primarily
pleading
to
--
for
my
own
man,
and
to
to
try
to
get
him
off
with
his
life,
basically
that's
what
my
argument
was.
i
aimed
that
when
i
made
it
to
the
jury.
of
course,
i
treated
it
as
i
recall
that
each
one
should
stand
on
his
own
feet
and
the
jury
should
measure
them
separately,
not
collectively.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
i
specifically
recall
him
mentioning
the
statement
to
lieutenant
yates
about
the
positions
in
the
car,
i
think
he
mentioned
the
route
they
took
and
the
polyethylene
cord
and
would
be
found
with
the
body
and
do
not
overlook
the
obvious.
i
recall
a
prosecutor
making
a
strong
point
of
that,
but
now
the
extent
beyond
that
to
which
he
went
i
am
not
sufficiently
refreshed
to
tell
you.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
yes
sir,
that's
true.
that
was
yes
to
the
statement
that
he
did
that
in
--
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
yes,
sir
and
schneble
also
told
them
that,
he
strangled
with
a
cord
and
then
that
defendant
snell
took
pistol
and
shot
her
in
her
head.
now
there
was
further
testimony
from,
i
believe
it
was
expert
leslie
smith,
ballistic
expert
to
testify
that
the
gun
that
was
taken
off
the
defendant's
snell
was
the
murder
--
was
probable,
highly
probable,
that
was
his
testimony,
he
could
not
positively
identify
it,
but
he
said
it
was
highly
probable,
the
reason
he
couldn't
possibly
test
that
was
because
--
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
yes,
sir
and
further.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
well
--
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
that
is
the
strongest,
but
justice
brennan
i
don't
concede
that
that
is
the
only
way
that
(inaudible)
would
apply,
because
he
also
told
lieutenant
yates
about
the
route
they
had
taken
from
new
orleans,
that
schneble
was
in
the
car
from
new
orleans
along
with
the
girl.
he
also
told
them
that
--
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
yes,
sir.
now
there
were
some
weak
testimony
from
new
orleans
but
the
girl
that
saw
--
the
girl
with
these
two
boys,
but
she
didn't
see
them
leave,
so
i
think
that
i
am
correct
in
saying
that
the
only
testimony
connecting
or
putting
them
two
in
the
car
was
from
the
two
defendant's
saying.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
no
sir.
there
has
to
be
proof
of
the
corpus
delicti
independent
of
the
statement
which
we
contend
would
not
be
there
without
the
statement
of
the
--
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
of
schneble
and/or
snell,
yes
sir,
one
or
the
other.
of
course
you
can't
use
the
confession
of
the
defendant
in
proving
the
corpus
delicti.
it's
got
to
be
proven
independently.
so
i
say
that
you
cannot
in
this
case
use
the
testimony
of
the
defendant
snell
either
--
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
sir?
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
that
a
crime
was
committed
by
the
criminal
agency
of
another,
that's
generally
what
i
have
been
--
there
has
been
a
crime
committed
and
it
was
by
the
criminal
agency
of
another
and
without
the
statement
of
these
two
defendants,
either
or
both
of
them
--
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
it
is
my
position
that
in
that
situation
there
never
would
have
been
a
corpus
delicti
proven
and
that
they
never
have
gotten
to
the
--
they
never
would
have
gotten
to
the
confession
stage,
they
never
would
have
gotten
it
and
therefore
there
could
not
have
been
a
conviction.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
not
without
proving
a
corpus
delicti
independent
of
this
thing.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
but
you
see
without
his
statement,
there
would
have
been
no
body.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
without
defendant
schneble's
statement.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
because
i
keep
going
back
to
this
corpus
delicti
and
because
of
that
requirement
i
would
say
no,
they
could
not
have
done.
because
--
i
would
say
that
they
would
not
have
gotten
to
the
confession
of
schneble,
had
it
not
been
for
the
allowing
of
the
statement
to
the
court.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
they
were
introduced
to
both
to
corroborate
each
other
and
the
strengthen
the
position
of
the
state,
that's
my
position.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
no
sir,
and
i'll
tell
you
why.
by
the
time
we
had
gotten
to
the
part
where
we
had
argued
till
we
were
blue
in
the
face,
we
had
the
jury
out,
we
had
taken
extensive
testimony
on
schneble,
his
testimony
--
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
yes,
that's
correct
and
there
--
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
my
comparison
--
i
have
taken
the
position
that
these
limiting
instructions
are
not
--
have
never
been
introduced.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
yes,
and
therefore
i
saw
no
reason
to
suggest
that.
i
would
like
to
take
five
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
yes.
justice
rehnquist,
you
asked
question
about
the
body
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
that,
that
those
who
viewed
the
body
would
view
it
as
a
result
of
the
confession
and
therefore
would
be
the
fruits
of
the
confession
and
could
not
be
considered
as
part
of
the
corpus
delicti
in
my
position
of
the
case.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
i
have
that
in
my
hand,
i
was
going
to
read
it
to
the
court
before
it
would
permit.
this
is
lieutenant
yates
testifying.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
page
409,
yes.
and
he
was
talking
to
--
lieutenant
yates
was
questioning
snell,
that
what
did
you
say
in
response
to
that?
during
the
time,
that
time
he
told
me
that
i
had
during
the
previous
interview
painted
a
hypothetical
picture
of
what
had
happened.
i
asked
him
what
he
meant
by
this.
he
said,
that
during
the
processing
of
the
automobile
that
there
was
a
piece
of
polyethylene
line
that
had
been
found
in
this
automobile
and
he
said,
if
and
when
they
find
this
body,
look
for
a
piece
of
polyethylene
line
and
don't
overlook
the
obvious.
did
he
later
stated
where
each
of
these
people
had
been
riding,
that
was
lieutenant
yates
question.
answer,
yes
sir.
he
stated
that
if
they
processed
this
automobile
for
fingerprints,
that
they
would
not
find
his
prints
present
anywhere
in
the
automobile,
except
in
the
drivers
area,
that
schneble
had
occupied
the
rear
seat
of
the
automobile
and
he
had
occupied
the
driver's
seat.
now
that
is
where
he
made
the
mistake,
to
put
them
in
the
back
seat,
(inaudible)
than
that.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
yes
sir,
lieutenant
yates
used
the
name
schneble
as
–
quoting
snell.
mr.
georgieff
indicated
that
in
schneble's
confession,
he
never
admitted
he
was
in
the
back
seat.
but
on
page
280
of
the
transcript
you
will
find
that
he
did
admit
that
he
was
in
the
back
seat
and
he
answer
to
a
question,
after
they
went
for
a
walk
on
the
beach
talking
about
snell
and
to
the
victim.
he
said,
they
came
down
the
road
and
when
they
stopped,
snell
dropped
the
plastic
cord
into
his
lap
and
motioned
with
his
hand
and
he
said
at
that
point,
he
put
the
cord
around
her
neck
and
started
to
squeeze.
now
i
have
got
the
impression,
down
the
road
in
the
automobile.
he
said,
he
pulled
as
hard
as
he
could
and
held
as
long
as
he
could,
but
she
was
a
good
fat
woman
and
gave
out
and
he
relaxed.
so,
i
feel
like
there
is
other
places
in
the
testimony
where
schneble
admitted
he
was
in
the
back
seat,
but
that
points
out
for
the
purpose
of
argument
what
i
am
trying
to
show
you.
now
i
would
further
say
that
the
corroboration
of
the
defendant
snell's
testimony
is
the
main
trust
of
this
bruton
argument
in
this
case,
that
i
am
here
on
today.
not
yet
these
two
things
that
i
have
pointed
out
to
you,
but
the
whole
bit
from
start
to
finish,
the
testimony
of
the
trooper,
the
testimony
of
the
fbi
agent
kellogg
where
he
is
quoting
snell
--
trooper
maddock
is
quoting
snell,
lieutenant
yates
is
quoting
snell,
all
of
these
things
corroborate
the
testimony,
the
confession
that's
given
by
the
petitioner
schneble.
i
also
want
to
point
out
to
you
that
i
feel
that
this
harm
that's
done
in
these
situations
is
the
reason
for
the
rule
in
bruton.
it
was
also
the
reason
for
the
criminal
rule
14
of
the
federal
rule
of
criminal
procedures
which
i
recognize
is
not
binding
on
the
state
of
florida,
but
they
are
inductive
of
the
opinion
that
exist
with
regard
to
what
constitution
violation
of
a
person's
rights.
and
so
when
you
put
these
two
cases
together,
put
them
in
the
same
(inaudible)
and
require,
--
understand
together,
fall
together,
certainly
there
is
no
way
that
you
can
say
that
the
defendant
schneble
was
not
prejudiced
by
the
defendant's
snell
presence
in
that
courtroom,
being
tried
in
the
joint
trial.
and
although
it's
a
matter
of
degree
i
concede
that
it
is
a
matter
of
degree
but
certainly
he
was
prejudiced
by
snell's
presence
there,
just
the
same
as
snell
was
prejudiced
by
schneble’s
presence
there.
and
we
are
arguing
about
the
question
of
degree
and
that
should
not
be
the
controlling
factor
because
if
schneble
would
have
come
out
of
there
on
his
own
with
a
life
sentence
whereas
by
standing
with
snell,
he
got
the
death
sentence,
then
he
has
been
prejudiced
in
this
instance
because
otherwise
he'd
be
walking
out
with
his
life
not
in
jeopardy
as
he
stands
today.
mr.
clyde
b.
wells
no,
well,
he
entered
a
plea
to
a
manslaughter
was
given
five
years
and
time
to
