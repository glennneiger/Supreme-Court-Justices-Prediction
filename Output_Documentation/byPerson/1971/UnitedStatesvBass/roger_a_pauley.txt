mr.
roger
a.
pauley
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
criminal
case
involving
the
construction
and
constitutionality
of
a
federal
gun
control
statute
enacted
in
june
of
1968.
the
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit,
which
reversed
a
judgment
of
conviction
under
the
pertinent
statutes
which
are
codified
in
title
18,
united
state
code
appendix,
sections
1201
and
1202.
in
view
of
the
issues,
i
would
like
to
briefly
sketch
the
provisions
of
the
statute
before
stating
the
underlying
facts.
they
appear
at
pages
2
to
3
of
our
brief.
in
section
1201,
the
congress
makes
various
formal
findings
to
the
effect
that
to
receive
possession
for
transportation
of
a
firearm
by
enumerated
classes
of
person,
including
convicted
felons,
constitutes
a
burden
on
commerce
or
threat
affecting
the
free
flow
of
commerce,
a
threat
to
the
safety
of
the
president
and
vice-president
of
the
united
states,
an
impediment
or
threat
to
the
exercise
of
free
speech
or
religion
and
a
threat
to
continued
and
effective
operation
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
and
of
states.
section
1202
(a)
then
defines
certain
crimes,
including
the
one
of
which
respondent
here
was
convicted.
it
provides
and
i
am
quoting
the
pertinent
part;
“any
person
who
has
been
convicted
by
a
court
of
the
united
states
or
of
a
state
or
any
political
subdivisions
thereof
of
a
felony
and
who
receives,
posses,
or
transports
in
commerce
or
affecting
commerce
after
the
date
of
enactment
of
this
act,
any
firearm”
shall
be
guilty
of
a
federal
crime.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
as
follows.
a
federal
undercover
agent
went
to
respondent's
apartment
in
the
bronx
in
the
later
part
of
july
1969,
to
find
narcotics.
respondent
let
him
in
and
directed
him
down
stairs
where
he
made
a
narcotics
purchase
from
an
unknown
individual.
the
next
day,
the
same
agent
returned
with
a
radio
to
exchange
for
narcotics
and
once
again
the
respondent
opened
the
door,
this
time
respondent
was
holding
an
automatic
pistol
in
his
hand,
which
he
explained
he
did
as
a
precaution
because
of
the
large
number
of
burglaries
in
the
area.
the
two
men
then
consummated
a
transaction
in
which
the
agent
purchased
seven
bags
of
heroin
from
the
respondent
in
exchange
for
radio
and
the
agent
left.
he
obtained
an
arrest
warrant
for
respondent
and
a
search
warrant
for
his
apartment
and
went
back
on
the
next
day.
shortly
after
he
was
admitted
on
this
occasion,
other
agent
who
had
remained
outside
entered
the
premises,
arrested
respondent
and
searched
the
apartment
pursuant
to
the
warrant.
they
found
the
automatic
pistol
hidden
under
a
bathtub
and
sawed
off
shotgun
laying
near
respondent's
bed.
respondent
was
charge
as
a
previously
convicted
felon
under
section
1202
(a)
in
two
counts,
with
possession
of
the
automatic
pistol
and
of
the
sawed
off
shotgun.
he
was
further
charged
in
a
count
with
carrying
a
firearm
during
the
commission
of
a
felony.
the
jury
acquitted
respondent
of
that
account
which
thus
is
not
here
now,
but
found
him
guilty
under
the
two
section
1202
p(a)
counts.
it
was
stipulated
at
trial
that
respondent
had
been
convicted
in
the
courts
of
the
state
of
new
york
of
the
felony
of
attempted
grand
larceny
in
the
second
degree.
respondent
interposed
no
factual
defense
for
the
jury
to
the
section
1202
(a)
charges.
following
the
verdict,
he
made
a
motion
for
the
judgment
of
acquittal,
contending
that
the
government
had
failed
to
either
prove
or
to
allege
what
he
contended
was
an
essential
element
of
the
offense,
namely
that
his
possession
of
the
firearm,
shown
to
have
been
in
or
to
have
affected
interstate
commerce.
the
district
judge
denied
this
motion
in
an
opinion
set
forth
at
pages
55
to
59
of
the
appendix,
holding
that
the
statute
properly
construed
did
not
require
proof
of
any
such
element
and
that
as
so
construed
it
was
constitutional,
both
under
the
commerce
clause
and
as
a
rational
exercise
of
congress'
power
to
safeguard
the
security
of
the
president
and
vice-president.
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed,
centrally
adopting
respondent’s
contention
as
to
how
the
statute
should
be
construed.
four
courts
of
appeals,
the
fourth,
sixth,
eighth,
and
ninth
circuits
have
held
to
the
contrary
and
in
accordance
with
the
views
of
the
district
court
in
this
case
that
the
statute
does
not
require
proof
of
an
interstate
commerce
element
with
respect
to
a
convicted
felon’s
possession
of
the
firearm.
because
of
that
conflict,
we
sought
review
by
this
court
and
this
court
granted
certiorari
last
term,
but
there
are
essentially
two
problems.
the
first
is
whether
the
statute
should
be
construed
to
eliminate
the
necessity
for
the
government
to
prove
an
individual
case
that
a
convicted
felon's
possession
of
firearm
had
been
in
or
affected
interstate
commerce
and
secondly,
if
so
construed,
is
the
statute
a
permissible
exercise
of
congress'
powers.
the
problem
in
construing
the
statue
arises
from
the
inclusion
of
the
words
and
i
once
again
invite
the
court’s
attention
to
pages
2
to
3
of
our
brief,
where
the
statute
is
set
forth,
inclusion
of
the
words
in
commerce
or
affecting
commerce
following
the
verb
transport
in
section
1202
(a).
the
court
below
looking
--
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
yes,
your
honor
essentially
we
think
that
the--
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
there
is
a
constitutional
question
assuming
that
you
were
to
hold
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong,
as
we
content
it
was
in
applying
the
in
commerce
or
affecting
commerce
language
to
the
receipt
and
possession
branches
of
the
statute,
you
would
then
have
to
reach,
as
four
courts
of
appeals
have
done,
the
constitutional
question
of
whether
a
statute,
which
eliminates
the
necessity
for
proof,
in
the
individual
case
of
any
such
effect
is
within
congress’
powers
under
the
constitution.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
that
is
correct,
your
honor
and
the
decision
below
came
before
this
court's
perez
decision
and
it
was
written
by
the
judge
who
had
dissented
in
the
court
of
appeals
from
the
affirmance
of
the
conviction
in
perez
case,
but
i
would
first
like
to
address
myself
to
the
threshold
issue
of
what
the
proper
construction
of
the
statute
should
be.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
yes,
it
did
your
honor.
this
was
--
they
did
not
hold
that
the
statute
would
be
unconstitutional
within
the
manner
we
urge,
but
they
did
say
that
it
would
raise
a
serious
constitutional
question
--
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
that
is
correct.
we
will
argue
at
the
appropriate
time
that
not
even
serious
constitutional
doubt
in
our
view
were
raised
by
this
statute
because
as
the
perez
opinion
indicated
--
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
i
realize
you
dissented
in
that
case
your
honor,
but
as
the
opinion
indicated
the
court
could
purported
at
least,
the
eighth
to
be
following
a
long
line
of
cases
emanating
from
united
states
against
darby,
312
united
states,
and
with
respect
to
the
statute
constructed
in
similar
fashion
to
this
one,
where
congress
makes
findings
and
then
eliminates
on
the
basis
of
them.
the
necessity
for
proof
in
an
individual
case
that
a
particular
transaction
has
affected
commerce
and
so
we
think
that
on
the
basis
of
the
prior
precedence,
the
second
circuit
erred
in
this
case
even
in
holding
that
a
serious
constitutional
doubt.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
that
is
correct.
we
are
arguing
that
the
statute
(voice
overlap)
is
constitutional.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
that
is
correct
and
in
addition
i
should
say,
we
think
that
are
limits
to
the
doctrine
that
statutes
should
construed
to
avoid
constitutional
doubts
and
that
the
legislative
of
history
and
other
features
of
this
statute
make
application
of
that
doctrine
by
the
court
of
appeals
inappropriate
here
even
were
there
constitutional
doubts.
the
second
circuit
reasoned,
looking
at
the
text
of
section
1202
(a)
alone,
that
since
the
words
in
commerce
or
affecting
commerce
should
be
given
some
substantive
content
and
since
it
was
seem
to
be
clear
that
they
applied
to
the
transportation
benefits,
that
logic
compelled
their
application
also,
to
the
receive
and
possession
branches
of
the
statute,
since
it
would
have
made
no
sense
for
congress
to
distinguish,
in
terms
of
elements
of
the
crime
between
receipt
and
possession
of
the
firearm
by
a
convicted
felon
on
the
one
hand
and
transportation
of
a
firearm
on
the
other,
particularly
since
transportation
which
seem
of
necessity
to
encompass
a
convicted
felon’s
possession
of
a
firearm.
now,
this
argument
has
a
certain
plausibility,
although
it
does
not
accord
with
the
grammar
of
the
section,
when
only
the
words
of
1202
(a)
are
with
that.
but
we
submit
that
by
confining
its
attention
to
the
words
of
section
1202
(a)
alone,
the
court
below
neglected
to
consider
several
other
indicia
of
congressional
intent
which
far
out
weighed
the
force
of
this
argument.
in
the
first
place,
the
court
below
neglected
to
take
into
account
the
implication
to
be
drawn
from
congress'
inclusion
of
the
formal
findings
in
section
1201.
there,
the
congress
found
that
the
receive,
possession
or
transportation
of
a
firearm
by
felons
constituted
a
burden
on
interstate
and
foreign
commerce.
it
would
have
been
an
irrational
act
were
congress
so
to
find
were
its
intent
merely
to
follow
such
a
finding
by
the
enactment
of
the
statute,
which
included
as
an
element
in
the
individual
prosecution.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
in
1202
(a)
you
mean,
your
honor?
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
sound
answer
to
that
your
honor
other
than
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute,
which
i
was
going
to
come
to
in
a
moment,
indicates
that
it
may
have
been
put
in
there
as
inadvertence
--
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
in
any
event,
we
think
it
should
confined,
not
withstanding
the
possible
logic
of
this
position
solely
to
the
transportation
branch
of
the
statute.
the
explanation
may
in
part
rest
on
the
fact
that
this
statute
received
no
scrutiny
by
any
committees
in
either
house
of
the
congress.
it
was
introduced
in
may
of
1968,
by
senator
long
on
the
floor
of
the
senate,
as
an
amendment
to
what
is
an
enacted
in
the
following
month
as
the
omnibus
crime
control
and
safe
streets
act
of
1968.
senator
long
on
two
occasions
explained
the
purpose
of
this
amendment
in
such
a
manner
as
to
make
it
totally
clear
that
what
was
intended
was
a
blanket
prohibition
on
the
possession
or
receipt
of
firearms
by
convicted
felons.
indeed
on
one
occasion
in
a
colloquy
with
senator
mcclellan
which
is
set
forth
at
pages
of
12
to
13
of
our
brief,
senator
long
was
asked
by
senator
mcclellan;
under
your
bill
could
a
convicted
felon
have
a
firearm
in
his
own
home,
the
very
case
which
on
these
facts
is
now
before
the
court.
senator
long's
response
was
“no
he
could
not.”
in
addition,
the
court
of
appeals
below,
they
ought
to
take
into
account
that
since
1961,
it
has
been
a
federal
crime
for
a
convicted
felon
to
receive
or
transport
a
firearm
in
interstate
or
foreign
commerce.
those
sections
which
formerly
were
codified
in
title
15
of
the
united
states
code
would
carry
forward
as
title
4
of
the
very
same
omnibus
crime
control
and
safe
streets
act
to
which
senator
long’s
bill
was
an
amendment.
and,
they
--
title
4
was
sponsored
by
senator
dodd,
who
pertinently
inquired
of
senator
long
on
the
4
whether
his
bill
was
intended
to
replace
title
4
and
senator
long
responded,
“no,”
rather
that
it
was
intended
to
add
to
with
the
complement
that
title.
now,
it
is
true
that
even
if
section
1202
(a)
were
to
be
construed
in
the
fashion
that
the
court
below
did,
so
as
to
require
proof
of
an
interstate
commerce
element,
as
to
a
possession
charge.
if
and
title
4
would
not
cover
exactly
the
same
grounds
since
they
apply
to
certain
different
categories
of
persons,
but
the
principle
provision,
both
in
section
1202
(a)
and
in
title
4
is
its
prohibition
on
the
class
of
persons
who
are
convicted
felons
from
possessing
firearms.
and
so,
we
submit
that
senator
long’s
answer
to
senator
dodd
taken
in
conjunction
with
the
rest
of
the
legislative
history
and
the
inclusion
of
the
formal
findings
in
1201
and
the
grammar
of
section
1202
(a)
make
it
abundantly
clear
that
at
least
as
to
the
crime
of
possession
of
a
firearm,
congress
intended
not
to
require
proof
of
an
affect
on
interstate
commerce
in
the
individual
prosecution,
but
rather
to
rely
on
the
formal
findings.
turning
then
to
the
constitutional
questions,
there
are
no
--
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
felon
is
defined,
the
provision
is
section
1202
(c)
and
is
set
forth
at
page
3
for
our
brief.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
that
is
correct
your
honor,
justice
--
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
that
is
certainly
true,
your
honor
--
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
i
do
not
think
--
this
is
a
point
which
respondent
has
raised
in
his
answering
brief
and
which
both
sides
agree
was
not
reached
by
the
court
below
and
thus
need
not
to
be
considered
here,
but
were
to
be
considered.
we
do
not
think
it
raises
a
significant
constitutional
question,
since
congress’
power
to
incorporate
state
definitions
of
felonies
has
been
exercised
many
times.
for
example,
in
a
assimilative
crimes
act
and
--
which
seemed
to
be
a
rational
need
where
congress
to
legislate.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
no,
i
do
not
think
so,
your
honor.
the
power
which
congress
sought
to
exercise
in
--
in
top
was
--
was
limited
to
--
to
cases
in
which
it
could
could
be
shown
that
a
firearm
had
--
had
been
in
commerce
and
it
--
it
then
sought
to
reach
that
result
or
at
least
to
--
to
authorize
a
jury
to
find
that
fact
by
means
of
a
presumption
flowing
from
the
fact
of
possession
itself
and
what
this
court
held
was
that
the
presumption
was
invalid
because
there
was
no
rationale
nexus
between
mere
possession
and
a
finding
of
that
a
firearm
had
moved
in
interstate
commerce
in
an
individual
case.
what
congress
has
done
here
on
the
contrary
is
to
find
that
a
class
of
activity
is
mainly
in
possession
of
firearms
by
convicted
appellant
in
the
aggregate
affects
interstate
commerce,
and
therefore,
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
government
in
an
individual
case
to
--
to
prove
the
existence
of
a
significant
impact
on
commerce
from
felon’s
possession.
turning
to
the
constitutional
question
then,
we
do
rely
on
this
court's
decision
in
perez
last
term
which
involved
a
statute
making
it
an
offense
to
engage
in
extortion
credit
activities
where
the
congress
first
made
formal
bindings
to
the
affect
that
this
class
of
transactions
as
a
whole
had
a
detrimental
impact
on
the
commerce
and
then
enacted
crime
defining
sections
which
eliminated
the
necessity
for
proof
in
the
individual
case.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
it
would
--
it
would
be
closer
to
the
facts
of
perez
were
that
true,
but
the
essential
feature
of
perez
on
which
we
rely
is
the
test
was
assessing
the
constitutionality
of
statute
of
these
species
which
the
court
in
perez
reaffirmed,
and
in
that
test
is
simply
whether
the
findings
made
by
congress
have
a
rationale
basis.
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief,
certain
of
facts
before
congress
at
the
time
of
enactment
of
this
statute
on
which
we
submit
that
congress
could
reasonably
conclude
that
possession
of
firearms
by
convicted
felons
did
have
a
detrimental
impact
on
commerce.
in
essence,
they
are
that
the
national
cost
in
terms
of
monies
taken
alone
from
certain
crimes
such
as
burglary,
robbery
and
larceny,
was
in
1967,
much
the
better
part
of
1
billion
dollars
and
now
exceeds
that
figure.
that
further
statistics
show
that
a
high
percentage
of
such
crimes
was
committed
with
firearms
and
that
other
statistics
showed
that
a
similarly
high
percentage
was
committed
by
recidivists,
by
persons
with
previous
criminal
records
and
based
on
the
aggregate
national
cost
the
impact
to
our
economy
from
the
commission
of
the
crimes
by
this
class
of
persons,
we
think
congress
could
rationally
conclude
that
to
put
firearms
in
the
hands
of
convicted
felons
or
not
to
attempt
to
punish
that
would
not
result
in
a
serious
detrimental
affect
upon
interstate
commerce.
and
we
rely
not
only
on
the
amounts
taken
as
a
result
of
such
criminal
conduct,
but
on
the
further
back
as
senator
long
noted
to
his
colleagues
in
the
senate
that
the
possession
of
firearms
by
convicted
felons
would
be
deter
large
numbers
of
people
from
doing
business
which
in
turn
would
seriously
affect
commerce.
in
addition
to
the
commerce
clause
basis
of
the
statute,
we
also
think
the
statute
maybe
sustained
as
the
district
judge
did
on
the
basis
of
congress'
undoubted
powers
to
safeguard
the
life
of
the
president
of
the
united
states.
the
court
of
appeals
below
did
not
discuss
this
alternative
finding
by
the
district
court
which
has
been
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
this
court
only
recently
in
the
waltz
(ph)
case
had
occasion
to
note
that
the
safety
of
the
president
is
of
course
no
matter
of
overwhelming
national
concern
in
view
of
the
overriding
nature
of
that
interest
and
in
view
of
the
unfortunate
history
in
this
country
of
assaults
and
assassinations
by
firearms
upon
former
presidents
and
other
high
public
officials,
we
submit
that
it
was
not
unreasonable
for
congress
to
conclude
that
even
though
an
indirect
means,
it
would
significantly
for
the
safety
of
the
president
and
vice
president
to
make
it
a
crime
for
a
convicted
felon
to
possess
a
firearm.
for
these
reasons,
we
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
should
be
reversed
and
of
course
remand
it
with
directions
to
restate
the
judgment
and
sentence
of
the
district
court.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
yes,
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
yes,
and
for
the
court's
convenience
i
would
point
out
that
the
six
circuit's
opinion
which
is
one
of
the
more
extensive
is
now
reported,
it
was
not
at
the
time
of

and
it
is

mr.
roger
a.

it
is

yes
it
is,

it
is
set
forth
at

mr.
roger
a.
pauley
i
have
nothing
further,
your
honor,
unless
there
are
questions?
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
criminal
case
involving
the
construction
and
constitutionality
of
a
federal
gun
control
statute
enacted
in
june
of
1968.
the
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit,
which
reversed
a
judgment
of
conviction
under
the
pertinent
statutes
which
are
codified
in
title
18,
united
state
code
appendix,
sections
1201
and
1202.
in
view
of
the
issues,
i
would
like
to
briefly
sketch
the
provisions
of
the
statute
before
stating
the
underlying
facts.
they
appear
at
pages
2
to
3
of
our
brief.
in
section
1201,
the
congress
makes
various
formal
findings
to
the
effect
that
to
receive
possession
for
transportation
of
a
firearm
by
enumerated
classes
of
person,
including
convicted
felons,
constitutes
a
burden
on
commerce
or
threat
affecting
the
free
flow
of
commerce,
a
threat
to
the
safety
of
the
president
and
vice-president
of
the
united
states,
an
impediment
or
threat
to
the
exercise
of
free
speech
or
religion
and
a
threat
to
continued
and
effective
operation
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
and
of
states.
section
1202
(a)
then
defines
certain
crimes,
including
the
one
of
which
respondent
here
was
convicted.
it
provides
and
i
am
quoting
the
pertinent
part;
“any
person
who
has
been
convicted
by
a
court
of
the
united
states
or
of
a
state
or
any
political
subdivisions
thereof
of
a
felony
and
who
receives,
posses,
or
transports
in
commerce
or
affecting
commerce
after
the
date
of
enactment
of
this
act,
any
firearm”
shall
be
guilty
of
a
federal
crime.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
as
follows.
a
federal
undercover
agent
went
to
respondent's
apartment
in
the
bronx
in
the
later
part
of
july
1969,
to
find
narcotics.
respondent
let
him
in
and
directed
him
down
stairs
where
he
made
a
narcotics
purchase
from
an
unknown
individual.
the
next
day,
the
same
agent
returned
with
a
radio
to
exchange
for
narcotics
and
once
again
the
respondent
opened
the
door,
this
time
respondent
was
holding
an
automatic
pistol
in
his
hand,
which
he
explained
he
did
as
a
precaution
because
of
the
large
number
of
burglaries
in
the
area.
the
two
men
then
consummated
a
transaction
in
which
the
agent
purchased
seven
bags
of
heroin
from
the
respondent
in
exchange
for
radio
and
the
agent
left.
he
obtained
an
arrest
warrant
for
respondent
and
a
search
warrant
for
his
apartment
and
went
back
on
the
next
day.
shortly
after
he
was
admitted
on
this
occasion,
other
agent
who
had
remained
outside
entered
the
premises,
arrested
respondent
and
searched
the
apartment
pursuant
to
the
warrant.
they
found
the
automatic
pistol
hidden
under
a
bathtub
and
sawed
off
shotgun
laying
near
respondent's
bed.
respondent
was
charge
as
a
previously
convicted
felon
under
section
1202
(a)
in
two
counts,
with
possession
of
the
automatic
pistol
and
of
the
sawed
off
shotgun.
he
was
further
charged
in
a
count
with
carrying
a
firearm
during
the
commission
of
a
felony.
the
jury
acquitted
respondent
of
that
account
which
thus
is
not
here
now,
but
found
him
guilty
under
the
two
section
1202
p(a)
counts.
it
was
stipulated
at
trial
that
respondent
had
been
convicted
in
the
courts
of
the
state
of
new
york
of
the
felony
of
attempted
grand
larceny
in
the
second
degree.
respondent
interposed
no
factual
defense
for
the
jury
to
the
section
1202
(a)
charges.
following
the
verdict,
he
made
a
motion
for
the
judgment
of
acquittal,
contending
that
the
government
had
failed
to
either
prove
or
to
allege
what
he
contended
was
an
essential
element
of
the
offense,
namely
that
his
possession
of
the
firearm,
shown
to
have
been
in
or
to
have
affected
interstate
commerce.
the
district
judge
denied
this
motion
in
an
opinion
set
forth
at
pages
55
to
59
of
the
appendix,
holding
that
the
statute
properly
construed
did
not
require
proof
of
any
such
element
and
that
as
so
construed
it
was
constitutional,
both
under
the
commerce
clause
and
as
a
rational
exercise
of
congress'
power
to
safeguard
the
security
of
the
president
and
vice-president.
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed,
centrally
adopting
respondent’s
contention
as
to
how
the
statute
should
be
construed.
four
courts
of
appeals,
the
fourth,
sixth,
eighth,
and
ninth
circuits
have
held
to
the
contrary
and
in
accordance
with
the
views
of
the
district
court
in
this
case
that
the
statute
does
not
require
proof
of
an
interstate
commerce
element
with
respect
to
a
convicted
felon’s
possession
of
the
firearm.
because
of
that
conflict,
we
sought
review
by
this
court
and
this
court
granted
certiorari
last
term,
but
there
are
essentially
two
problems.
the
first
is
whether
the
statute
should
be
construed
to
eliminate
the
necessity
for
the
government
to
prove
an
individual
case
that
a
convicted
felon's
possession
of
firearm
had
been
in
or
affected
interstate
commerce
and
secondly,
if
so
construed,
is
the
statute
a
permissible
exercise
of
congress'
powers.
the
problem
in
construing
the
statue
arises
from
the
inclusion
of
the
words
and
i
once
again
invite
the
court’s
attention
to
pages
2
to
3
of
our
brief,
where
the
statute
is
set
forth,
inclusion
of
the
words
in
commerce
or
affecting
commerce
following
the
verb
transport
in
section
1202
(a).
the
court
below
looking
--
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
yes,
your
honor
essentially
we
think
that
the--
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
there
is
a
constitutional
question
assuming
that
you
were
to
hold
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong,
as
we
content
it
was
in
applying
the
in
commerce
or
affecting
commerce
language
to
the
receipt
and
possession
branches
of
the
statute,
you
would
then
have
to
reach,
as
four
courts
of
appeals
have
done,
the
constitutional
question
of
whether
a
statute,
which
eliminates
the
necessity
for
proof,
in
the
individual
case
of
any
such
effect
is
within
congress’
powers
under
the
constitution.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
that
is
correct,
your
honor
and
the
decision
below
came
before
this
court's
perez
decision
and
it
was
written
by
the
judge
who
had
dissented
in
the
court
of
appeals
from
the
affirmance
of
the
conviction
in
perez
case,
but
i
would
first
like
to
address
myself
to
the
threshold
issue
of
what
the
proper
construction
of
the
statute
should
be.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
yes,
it
did
your
honor.
this
was
--
they
did
not
hold
that
the
statute
would
be
unconstitutional
within
the
manner
we
urge,
but
they
did
say
that
it
would
raise
a
serious
constitutional
question
--
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
that
is
correct.
we
will
argue
at
the
appropriate
time
that
not
even
serious
constitutional
doubt
in
our
view
were
raised
by
this
statute
because
as
the
perez
opinion
indicated
--
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
i
realize
you
dissented
in
that
case
your
honor,
but
as
the
opinion
indicated
the
court
could
purported
at
least,
the
eighth
to
be
following
a
long
line
of
cases
emanating
from
united
states
against
darby,
312
united
states,
and
with
respect
to
the
statute
constructed
in
similar
fashion
to
this
one,
where
congress
makes
findings
and
then
eliminates
on
the
basis
of
them.
the
necessity
for
proof
in
an
individual
case
that
a
particular
transaction
has
affected
commerce
and
so
we
think
that
on
the
basis
of
the
prior
precedence,
the
second
circuit
erred
in
this
case
even
in
holding
that
a
serious
constitutional
doubt.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
that
is
correct.
we
are
arguing
that
the
statute
(voice
overlap)
is
constitutional.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
that
is
correct
and
in
addition
i
should
say,
we
think
that
are
limits
to
the
doctrine
that
statutes
should
construed
to
avoid
constitutional
doubts
and
that
the
legislative
of
history
and
other
features
of
this
statute
make
application
of
that
doctrine
by
the
court
of
appeals
inappropriate
here
even
were
there
constitutional
doubts.
the
second
circuit
reasoned,
looking
at
the
text
of
section
1202
(a)
alone,
that
since
the
words
in
commerce
or
affecting
commerce
should
be
given
some
substantive
content
and
since
it
was
seem
to
be
clear
that
they
applied
to
the
transportation
benefits,
that
logic
compelled
their
application
also,
to
the
receive
and
possession
branches
of
the
statute,
since
it
would
have
made
no
sense
for
congress
to
distinguish,
in
terms
of
elements
of
the
crime
between
receipt
and
possession
of
the
firearm
by
a
convicted
felon
on
the
one
hand
and
transportation
of
a
firearm
on
the
other,
particularly
since
transportation
which
seem
of
necessity
to
encompass
a
convicted
felon’s
possession
of
a
firearm.
now,
this
argument
has
a
certain
plausibility,
although
it
does
not
accord
with
the
grammar
of
the
section,
when
only
the
words
of
1202
(a)
are
with
that.
but
we
submit
that
by
confining
its
attention
to
the
words
of
section
1202
(a)
alone,
the
court
below
neglected
to
consider
several
other
indicia
of
congressional
intent
which
far
out
weighed
the
force
of
this
argument.
in
the
first
place,
the
court
below
neglected
to
take
into
account
the
implication
to
be
drawn
from
congress'
inclusion
of
the
formal
findings
in
section
1201.
there,
the
congress
found
that
the
receive,
possession
or
transportation
of
a
firearm
by
felons
constituted
a
burden
on
interstate
and
foreign
commerce.
it
would
have
been
an
irrational
act
were
congress
so
to
find
were
its
intent
merely
to
follow
such
a
finding
by
the
enactment
of
the
statute,
which
included
as
an
element
in
the
individual
prosecution.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
in
1202
(a)
you
mean,
your
honor?
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
sound
answer
to
that
your
honor
other
than
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute,
which
i
was
going
to
come
to
in
a
moment,
indicates
that
it
may
have
been
put
in
there
as
inadvertence
--
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
in
any
event,
we
think
it
should
confined,
not
withstanding
the
possible
logic
of
this
position
solely
to
the
transportation
branch
of
the
statute.
the
explanation
may
in
part
rest
on
the
fact
that
this
statute
received
no
scrutiny
by
any
committees
in
either
house
of
the
congress.
it
was
introduced
in
may
of
1968,
by
senator
long
on
the
floor
of
the
senate,
as
an
amendment
to
what
is
an
enacted
in
the
following
month
as
the
omnibus
crime
control
and
safe
streets
act
of
1968.
senator
long
on
two
occasions
explained
the
purpose
of
this
amendment
in
such
a
manner
as
to
make
it
totally
clear
that
what
was
intended
was
a
blanket
prohibition
on
the
possession
or
receipt
of
firearms
by
convicted
felons.
indeed
on
one
occasion
in
a
colloquy
with
senator
mcclellan
which
is
set
forth
at
pages
of
12
to
13
of
our
brief,
senator
long
was
asked
by
senator
mcclellan;
under
your
bill
could
a
convicted
felon
have
a
firearm
in
his
own
home,
the
very
case
which
on
these
facts
is
now
before
the
court.
senator
long's
response
was
“no
he
could
not.”
in
addition,
the
court
of
appeals
below,
they
ought
to
take
into
account
that
since
1961,
it
has
been
a
federal
crime
for
a
convicted
felon
to
receive
or
transport
a
firearm
in
interstate
or
foreign
commerce.
those
sections
which
formerly
were
codified
in
title
15
of
the
united
states
code
would
carry
forward
as
title
4
of
the
very
same
omnibus
crime
control
and
safe
streets
act
to
which
senator
long’s
bill
was
an
amendment.
and,
they
--
title
4
was
sponsored
by
senator
dodd,
who
pertinently
inquired
of
senator
long
on
the
4
whether
his
bill
was
intended
to
replace
title
4
and
senator
long
responded,
“no,”
rather
that
it
was
intended
to
add
to
with
the
complement
that
title.
now,
it
is
true
that
even
if
section
1202
(a)
were
to
be
construed
in
the
fashion
that
the
court
below
did,
so
as
to
require
proof
of
an
interstate
commerce
element,
as
to
a
possession
charge.
if
and
title
4
would
not
cover
exactly
the
same
grounds
since
they
apply
to
certain
different
categories
of
persons,
but
the
principle
provision,
both
in
section
1202
(a)
and
in
title
4
is
its
prohibition
on
the
class
of
persons
who
are
convicted
felons
from
possessing
firearms.
and
so,
we
submit
that
senator
long’s
answer
to
senator
dodd
taken
in
conjunction
with
the
rest
of
the
legislative
history
and
the
inclusion
of
the
formal
findings
in
1201
and
the
grammar
of
section
1202
(a)
make
it
abundantly
clear
that
at
least
as
to
the
crime
of
possession
of
a
firearm,
congress
intended
not
to
require
proof
of
an
affect
on
interstate
commerce
in
the
individual
prosecution,
but
rather
to
rely
on
the
formal
findings.
turning
then
to
the
constitutional
questions,
there
are
no
--
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
felon
is
defined,
the
provision
is
section
1202
(c)
and
is
set
forth
at
page
3
for
our
brief.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
that
is
correct
your
honor,
justice
--
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
that
is
certainly
true,
your
honor
--
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
i
do
not
think
--
this
is
a
point
which
respondent
has
raised
in
his
answering
brief
and
which
both
sides
agree
was
not
reached
by
the
court
below
and
thus
need
not
to
be
considered
here,
but
were
to
be
considered.
we
do
not
think
it
raises
a
significant
constitutional
question,
since
congress’
power
to
incorporate
state
definitions
of
felonies
has
been
exercised
many
times.
for
example,
in
a
assimilative
crimes
act
and
--
which
seemed
to
be
a
rational
need
where
congress
to
legislate.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
no,
i
do
not
think
so,
your
honor.
the
power
which
congress
sought
to
exercise
in
--
in
top
was
--
was
limited
to
--
to
cases
in
which
it
could
could
be
shown
that
a
firearm
had
--
had
been
in
commerce
and
it
--
it
then
sought
to
reach
that
result
or
at
least
to
--
to
authorize
a
jury
to
find
that
fact
by
means
of
a
presumption
flowing
from
the
fact
of
possession
itself
and
what
this
court
held
was
that
the
presumption
was
invalid
because
there
was
no
rationale
nexus
between
mere
possession
and
a
finding
of
that
a
firearm
had
moved
in
interstate
commerce
in
an
individual
case.
what
congress
has
done
here
on
the
contrary
is
to
find
that
a
class
of
activity
is
mainly
in
possession
of
firearms
by
convicted
appellant
in
the
aggregate
affects
interstate
commerce,
and
therefore,
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
government
in
an
individual
case
to
--
to
prove
the
existence
of
a
significant
impact
on
commerce
from
felon’s
possession.
turning
to
the
constitutional
question
then,
we
do
rely
on
this
court's
decision
in
perez
last
term
which
involved
a
statute
making
it
an
offense
to
engage
in
extortion
credit
activities
where
the
congress
first
made
formal
bindings
to
the
affect
that
this
class
of
transactions
as
a
whole
had
a
detrimental
impact
on
the
commerce
and
then
enacted
crime
defining
sections
which
eliminated
the
necessity
for
proof
in
the
individual
case.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
it
would
--
it
would
be
closer
to
the
facts
of
perez
were
that
true,
but
the
essential
feature
of
perez
on
which
we
rely
is
the
test
was
assessing
the
constitutionality
of
statute
of
these
species
which
the
court
in
perez
reaffirmed,
and
in
that
test
is
simply
whether
the
findings
made
by
congress
have
a
rationale
basis.
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief,
certain
of
facts
before
congress
at
the
time
of
enactment
of
this
statute
on
which
we
submit
that
congress
could
reasonably
conclude
that
possession
of
firearms
by
convicted
felons
did
have
a
detrimental
impact
on
commerce.
in
essence,
they
are
that
the
national
cost
in
terms
of
monies
taken
alone
from
certain
crimes
such
as
burglary,
robbery
and
larceny,
was
in
1967,
much
the
better
part
of
1
billion
dollars
and
now
exceeds
that
figure.
that
further
statistics
show
that
a
high
percentage
of
such
crimes
was
committed
with
firearms
and
that
other
statistics
showed
that
a
similarly
high
percentage
was
committed
by
recidivists,
by
persons
with
previous
criminal
records
and
based
on
the
aggregate
national
cost
the
impact
to
our
economy
from
the
commission
of
the
crimes
by
this
class
of
persons,
we
think
congress
could
rationally
conclude
that
to
put
firearms
in
the
hands
of
convicted
felons
or
not
to
attempt
to
punish
that
would
not
result
in
a
serious
detrimental
affect
upon
interstate
commerce.
and
we
rely
not
only
on
the
amounts
taken
as
a
result
of
such
criminal
conduct,
but
on
the
further
back
as
senator
long
noted
to
his
colleagues
in
the
senate
that
the
possession
of
firearms
by
convicted
felons
would
be
deter
large
numbers
of
people
from
doing
business
which
in
turn
would
seriously
affect
commerce.
in
addition
to
the
commerce
clause
basis
of
the
statute,
we
also
think
the
statute
maybe
sustained
as
the
district
judge
did
on
the
basis
of
congress'
undoubted
powers
to
safeguard
the
life
of
the
president
of
the
united
states.
the
court
of
appeals
below
did
not
discuss
this
alternative
finding
by
the
district
court
which
has
been
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
this
court
only
recently
in
the
waltz
(ph)
case
had
occasion
to
note
that
the
safety
of
the
president
is
of
course
no
matter
of
overwhelming
national
concern
in
view
of
the
overriding
nature
of
that
interest
and
in
view
of
the
unfortunate
history
in
this
country
of
assaults
and
assassinations
by
firearms
upon
former
presidents
and
other
high
public
officials,
we
submit
that
it
was
not
unreasonable
for
congress
to
conclude
that
even
though
an
indirect
means,
it
would
significantly
for
the
safety
of
the
president
and
vice
president
to
make
it
a
crime
for
a
convicted
felon
to
possess
a
firearm.
for
these
reasons,
we
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
should
be
reversed
and
of
course
remand
it
with
directions
to
restate
the
judgment
and
sentence
of
the
district
court.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
yes,
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
yes,
and
for
the
court's
convenience
i
would
point
out
that
the
six
circuit's
opinion
which
is
one
of
the
more
extensive
is
now
reported,
it
was
not
at
the
time
of
writing
these
briefs
and
it
is
in
440
f.
2nd
one
(voice
overlap)
440
f.
2nd,
144.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
yes
it
is
--
yes
it
is,
your
honor.
it
is
set
forth
at
438
f.
2nd,
764.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
i
have
nothing
further,
your
honor,
unless
there
are
questions?
