mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
justice
douglas
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
our
position
that
the
court
of
appeals'
interpretation
is
sound
for
many,
many
reasons,
but
let
me
first
fire
one
bell
in
my
--
one
arrow
in
my
bow
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
find
necessary
to
even
discuss
but
which
this
court
in
similar
situation
has
discussed,
namely,
this
is
a
criminal
statute.
it's
ambiguity
is
that
conceded.
in
fact,
it
is
so
evident
by
the
differences
of
opinion
among
the
district
courts
and
a
circuit
courts
and
the
government
concedes
only
as
ambiguous
you
must
--
if
we,
we
the
government
are
right
read
out
an
entire
section
of
the
provision.
that
where
there
is
an
ambiguity
of
this
degree,
this
being
a
penal
statute,
it
should
be
narrowly
construed
in
favor
of
a
criminal
defendant.
but
turning
now
to
the
reason,
the
facts
in
support
of
court
of
appeals'
decision
is;
one
the
court
of
appeals
was
dealing
with
the
statue
as
again
the
government
concedes
was
drafted
passed
with
the
greatest
of
haste,
with
an
absence
of
legislative
concentration
and
absence
of
finding
and
no
hearing.
the
government
on
oral
argument
has
just
made
a
further
confession
which
is
not
in
it's
brief
and
in
fact
which
my
brief
is
not
a
virtue,
is
namely
the
government
no
longer
as
i
understand
their
argument,
views
the
redundancy
argument
which
should
make
the
page
16
and
17
of
its
brief
as
flowing
as
it
does
in
its
brief.
namely
the
argument
against
the
second
circuit's
opinion
was
that,
if
its
interpretation
is
adapted
then
senator
long
statute,
in
essence
the
entire
section
of
1202,
on
page
17
of
the
government
brief
they
say
it's
better
to
cut
out
just
the
commerce
transport
section.
now,
it
is
to
make
the
entire
section
too
(inaudible).
as
i
understand
the
government,
they
now
say
it
won't
be
(inaudible)
and
that
is
a
very
good
reason.
and
i
apologize
to
court
for
not
really
getting
into
with
my
brief
because
the
answer
is
so
obvious
and
it
is
prior
to
an
error
in
the
government's
brief
at
page
16
at
footnote
4,
footnote
10,
excuse
me.
footnote
10
of
the
government
brief
says
that
title
iv
extended
the
class
firstly;
who
may
not
possess
weapon
--
who
may
not
ship
or
transport
weapons
in
the
interstate
commerce.
that
is
not
so.
that
expansion
takes
place
in
title
1
of
the
gun
control
act
of
1968
which
was
passed
four
months
after
the
long
amendment.
what
you
had
at
time
the
long
passed
was
old
18,
19,
22
(f)
and
(e)
then
transformed
into
(g)
and
(h)
of
title
iv
by
title
i
of
the
1968
act.
at
the
time
of
senator
long's
amendment,
all
you
had
was
a
prohibition
against
the
shipment
or
receipt
in
interstate
commerce
by
felons.
what
senator
long's
amendment
does
is
vastly
increase
the
numbers
of
persons
who
may
not
have
weapons,
namely
persons
discharged
from
the
armed
forces
on
the
dishonorable
condition,
mentally
competent,
persons
who
have
renounced
citizenship
and
unlawful
aliens.
also
title
iv
had
a
exclusion
for
white
color
felony.
title
vii,
senator
long's
amendment
was
not.
also
senator
long's
amendment
added
the
offense
of
possession
as
title
iv
deals
only
with
the
receipt
and
shipment.
and
i
say
that
title
vii,
senator
long's
amendment
does
include
the
terms
“transport
in
commerce
or
affecting
commerce.”
so
in
essence
what
the
court
of
appeals
was
done
is
on
the
legislative
record
before
it,
taken
the
statute
which
has
terms
apart
that
a
key
constitutional
terms,
namely
“affecting
commerce”
and
has
interpreted
the
statute
without
further
guidance
in
congress
that
(a)
avoids
the
reaching
of
a
constitutional
determination
as
to
congress'
power
to
legislate
against
the
mere
receipt
and
possession
without
proof
of
a
commerce
nexus.
it
is
to
that
question
that
the
government's
position
was
before
this
court.
now
as
i
have
understood
the
doctrine
concerning
constitutional
adjudication,
it
was
applicable
not
whether
or
not
the
constitutional
question
was
decided
favorably
for
one
party
or
the
other,
but
whether
or
not
it
need
be
decided
at
all.
now,
certainly
this
case
does
not
present
the
weather
ball
for
this
court,
i
think,
to
approach
that
question.
i
think
the
--
there
two
decisions
of
this
court
which
are
so
similar
in
my
mind
that
it
forms,
sort
of,
a
litigation
model
for
how
i
as
respondent's
counsel
suggest
revolution
in
this
case
and
i
in
out
brief
call
your
honors'
attention
to
first
the
case
of
united
states
versus
denmark
which
really
should
be
captioned
united
states
versus
five
gambling
devices,
an
opinion
by
justice
jackson
and
then
the
case
last
term
of
rewis
against
united
states.
in
both
of
those
cases
all
the
elements
that
we
seek
this
court
to
appreciate
give
our
side
were
present.
you
had
two
statute
dealing
with
congress'
power
to
affect
intrastate
determination.
in
denmark
it
was
whether
mere
registration
of
gambling
devices
that
had
no
connection
with
interstate
transaction
was
to
be
required.
the
statute
as
the
court
wrote,
could
have
been
interpreted
either
way,
but
the
legislative
history
in
denmark
was
silent,
offered
the
court
no
guidance
as
to
what
the
intend
of
congress
was.
and
the
court
said
(a)
this
is
a
penal
statute,
(b)
we
do
not
have
enough
from
congress
to
make
this
determination
and
(c)
there
were
other
elements,
namely
that
when
we
are
dealing
with
intrastate
matters,
you
also
are
dealing
with
the
sensitivity
of
federal
and
state
relations
and
also
indeed
with
the
consequences
to
federal
police
enforcement
powers,
material
for
expended
congressional
involvement,
federal
involvement
in
the
ordinary
concepts
of
the
criminal
law
normally
associated
with
state
police
power.
and
in
rewis,
again
an
opinion
mr.
justice
marshall,
without
help
from
congress,
clearly
designating
what
its
intent
was
although
the
statute
was
susceptible
to
two
constructions,
the
court
given
the
nature
of
a
case
as
a
criminal
case
took
the
narrow
construction.
we
think
that
the
constitutional
issue
indicates
that
it
is
not
as
simple
as
the
government
would
have
it.
i
believe
in
the
prior
argument,
mr.
solicitor
general
used
the
phrase
that
principles
have
a
tendency
to
expand
the
limit
to
their
logic.
i
would
like
to
borrow
that
phrase
because
it
does
describe
what
i
tried
to
communicate
to
the
court
in
point
two
of
our
brief.
as
i
understand
to
those
powers
commerce
of
congress
under
the
commerce
clause
as
this
court
has
decreed
it
in
recent
years.
it
is
very
vast,
but
it
is
not
unlimited.
it
is
a
question
of
degree.
the
polish
national
alliance
versus
nlrb
case
talks
which
cite
in
our
brief
talks
in
those
term.
now,
a
question
of
the
degree
means
that
you
have
to
look
on
a
spectrum
of
conduct
and
activity
as
i
see
it,
to
say
when
is
that
question
of
degree
beyond
congress'
power
and
here
we
think,
regulation
based
on
the
haste
to
the
amendment
absence
of
binding
all
like
recognized
that
court
does
not
require
findings
on
the
question
of
constitutional
power
of
the
congress.
it
requires
as
to
look
at
what
conduct
that
the
government's
interpretation
is
right
that
congress
is
really
thinking
off.
a
mere
receipt
or
possession
of
a
weapon
in
a
man's
own
home
without
more.
no
requirement
that
the
weapon
transported
in
interstate
commerce
or
came
in
to
interstate
commerce
which
leads
me
back
again
to
another
interesting
question,
the
casey
amendment
which
was
debated
in
congress
at
length
after
this
statute
was
enacted,
thought
--
the
subject
of
that
amendment
was
to
make
it
a
crime
to
commit
a
crime
of
any
kind
with
a
weapon
that
had
traveled
in
interstate
commerce.
so,
after
you
had
congress
talking,
as
a
government
would
have
it
about
not
requiring
a
commerce
nexus,
yet
to
achieve
the
very
results
which
the
government
says
this
statute
achieves
there
is
still
lengthy
debate
on
amendment
that
was
preceded.
but
returning
to
the
spectrum
of
criminal
conduct,
what
you
have
essentially
is
a
passive
act,
and
the
word
act
is
even
possibly
a
misnomer,
a
passive
state
of
affairs,
a
weapon
in
a
man's
home,
lying
dormant
and
not
affecting
anything.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
mr.
justice
douglas
and
may
it
please
the
court.
to
pick
up
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
the
redundancy
question,
the
redundancy
of
title
vii
and
title
iv
and
just
add
a
thought
about
why
i
think
that
even
if
there
is
a
slight
redundancy
in
language
with
respect
to
dealing
in
title
vii
interpretation
of
the
circuit
print
on
it
that
essentially
it
is
giving
what
congress
really
would
like
to
have
in
title
vii.
i
think
if
you
read
the
legislate
history
of
title
vii
and
the
provision
in
addition
to
1202
(a)
(1)
dealing
with
aliens,
with
mental
incompetence,
with
dishonorably
discharged
persons,
you
will
see
that
the
conceptual
natural
of
title
vii
and
i
think
what
senator
long
wanted
to
have
enacted
and
what
congress
i
think
believed
it
was
enacting
albeit
hastily
was
essentially
an
assassin
bill
that
up
to
that
time
the
congress
had
concerned
itself
merely
with
felons
and
weapons,
but
given
the
assassination
of
president
kennedy,
the
assassination
dr.
martin
luther
king,
you
can
tell
from
the
legislative
record,
brief
as
it
is
that
this
was
what
was
at
issue
when
this
bill
was
passed.
that
there
was
a
feeling
by
senator
long
on
getting
to
the
question
of
assassins
and
people
who
were
irresponsible
and
proscribing
them
from
having
weapons.
with
that
in
mind,
i
think
court,
i
must
have
for
the
constitutional
issue
to
convince
your
honors
that
it
is
serious
enough
to
at
least
forestall
decision
upon
it
until
the
case
presents
the
necessity
for
it.
this
is
not
that
case.
as
i
stated
earlier,
the
question
is
one
of
the
degree,
the
congress'
power
and
i
think
that
the
degree
must,
of
course,
be
very
far
removed
for
me
to
convince
you
that
congress
does
not
have
the
power.
but
i
think
as
i
said
on
the
spectrum
of
criminal
conduct,
the
mere
suggestion
of
a
weapon
goes
to
the
utmost
of
that
degree
wherein
congress
may
not
reach
because
it
is
essentially
a
passive
act
regulated
by
most
of
the
laws
of
the
states,
even
when
committed
by
a
man
with
a
prior
felony.
perez
of
course
is
a
tough
case,
but
i
do
not
believe
it
is
indistinguishable.
i
believe
if
anything
it
points
a
way
to
resolution
in
our
favor
of
the
issue
here
if
that
issue
must
be
decided.
as
mr.
justice
blackmun
pointed
out,
the
spectrum
of
mr.
pauley's
argument,
i
think
the
thrust
of
his
question
was
that,
doesn't
perez
have
within
it
a
replete,
replete
with
interstate
commerce
nexus.
the
statute,
the
consumer
title
ii
of
the
consumer
credit
protection
act
found
that
organized
crime
itself
was
interstate
and
international
character
and
that
a
substantial
part
of
the
income
of
organized
crime
was
generated
by
extortion
of
credit
transactions.
subdivision
3
of
that
section
found
that
extortion
of
credit
transactions
are
carried
on
to
a
substantial
extent
in
the
state
and
foreign
commerce
and
to
remove
instrumentally
of
such
commerce
and
then
it
fostered
out
the
ancillary
group
of
intrastate
no
trafficking
activities.
i
read
perez
as
a
traditional
commerce
clause
case
in
the
sense
that
congress
had
opted
to
regulate,
invoke
conduct
that
was
commercial,
but
in
essence
was
intrastate
in
character.
it
was
no
different
then
wickard
versus
filburn
where
simply
because
there
was
a
local
wheat
raising,
the
entire
scheme
of
regulation,
that
was
interstate
in
nature,
it
could
not
be
--
could
not
include
the
affected
of
that
intrastate
wheat
raising,
the
same
as
i
read
perez.
the
thrust
of
the
entire
title
iv
of
the
consumer
credit
protection
act
was
to
regulate
organize
crime,
was
to
regulate
interstate
transactions
and
to
bring
into
that
regulation
those
intrastate
activities
that
were
ancillary
and
of
course
would
affect
the
efficiency
and
effectiveness
of
the
total
essence
of
regulation.
there
is
no
such
class
of
activity
here
in
terms
of
gun
possession,
mere
gun
possession
or
receipt
by
a
felon
that
is
the
same
will
have
any
colliery
to
the
consumer
credit
protection
act
because
there
is
only
class
of
activity
and
i
think
that
is
key
phrase
in
commerce
clause
motivation.
here
is
the
class
of
activities
is
simply
the
unit
of
the
local
possession
and
receipt.
there
is
no
larger
units
of
interstate
regulation
in
the
terms
of
effect
on
commerce.
so,
that
congress,
if
the
government
is
correct,
has
opted
to
regulate
something
that
is
not
part
of
an
interstate
regulation
scheme,
but
starts
out
as
intrastate
and
ends
being
intrastate
and
i
think
that
the
language,
justice
hugo
employed
in
dissent
in
perez,
although
not
shared
by
the
other
members
of
the
court,
is
the
kind
that
the
language
that
commends
itself
to
resolution
here
because
if
this
statute
would
be
sustained
as
a
proper
exercise
the
commerce
power,
mainly
mere
possession
on
the
theory
that
your
possession
would
then
prompt
an
act
and
the
act
itself
would
affect
commerce,
namely
the
robbery
or
the
larceny,
that
congress
can
rightfully
regulate
the
possession.
with
that
as
your
common
denominator,
mere
possession,
what
you
have
is
the
ability
of
the
congress
to
regulate
any
type
of
crime,
nearly
any
type
of
crimes
so
long
as
the
logical
extension
is
that
somewhere
beyond
the
crime
commerce
will
be
affected.
now,
once
again
talking
about
the
expended
logic
will
open
that
case.
i
could
not
on
a
some
logistic
basis
deny
that
some
men
with
a
gun
might
then
opt
to
use
that
gun
to
commit
a
crime
which
then
might
bring
itself
within
new
realm
of
statistical
materials
that
the
government
offers
to
you
as
a
rationale
basis.
but
that
i
think
really
extends
the
commerce
power
quite
a
bit
too
far
and
it's
interesting
that
the
congress
has
not
yet
attempted
to
regulate
the
act
of
crime
which
would
directly
affect
interstate
commerce
or
even
indirectly
affect
interstate
commerce.
a
robbery,
a
larceny
and
yet
it
has
--
if
the
government
is
correct
opted
to
jump
over
those
acts
and
go
right
to
the
mere
possession
which
may
or
may
not
have
any
affect
that
all
on
interstate
commerce.
i
think
in
that
context
the
perez
decision
does
not
point
a
way
for
an
easy
resolution
of
the
constitutional
issue
in
this
case.
unless
is
to
say
a
especially
in
a
case
where
there
are
no
findings,
there
are
no
hearings
that
congress
may
simply
designate
passive
criminal
conduct
and
again
i
use
the
word
conduct
cautiously,
they
simply
designate
that,
posit
that
since
crimes
are
committed
with
weapons,
albeit
local
crimes
that
then,
therefore,
there
was
federal
power
to
regulate
and
i
would
suggest
that
before
congress
goes
that
far
it
ought
to
at
least
take
intermediate
step
and
have
the
question
presented
whether
the
regulation
of
a
mere
act
of
robbery
could
be
properly
within
the
federal
scope.
in
this
case,
it
does
not.
the
government's
position
in
short
i
submit
is
really
conjectural
one
that
absent
findings
or
hearings
or
finding
as
there
are,
but
absent
hearings,
the
statistics
which
the
government
posits
really
are
of
no
help
to
the
court
as
i
see
it
because
they
in
a
way
prove
too
much
and
i
should
say
that
in
the
sense
that
they
don't
prove
anything
at
all,
to
say
that
commerce
is
affected
by
large
amount
of
robberies
and
larcenies
does
not
get
you
to
the
point
where
you
can
simply
resolve
a
constitutional
question
of
the
possession
of
the
weapon
as
being
not
connected
to
commerce.
absent,
any
kind
of
explication
by
congress
of
the
relevancy
of
mere
weapon's
possession
by
a
very
narrow,
limited
group
of
personnel
for
a
selling
and
its
connection
to
commerce,
i
see
very
little
basis
on
the
record
before
this
court,
both
in
this
case
and
the
legislative
record
for
taking
that
serious
step
of
expansion
under
the
commerce
clause.
again,
i
say
that
i
do
not
think
i
have
to
convince
you
that
the
step
for
not
be
taking
of
that
--
and
i
do
believe
that
it
is
unconstitutional
for
congress
to
that
this
far,
but
i
always
seek
to
convince
that
there
is
a
serious
issue,
which
the
construction
given
in
the
statute
by
the
court
of
appeals
can
help
you
avoid
deciding
that
question
on
this
particular
record
and
in
this
particular
case.
now
the
government
in
its
oral
argument,
but
not
in
it's
brief
choose
for
the
first
time
to
rely
on
the
power
of
congress
to
protect
the
vice
president
and
the
president
as
a
means
for
sustaining
the
statute.
this
was
a
position
taken
by
judge
franco,
although
rather
personally
and
the
government
does
not
--
did
not
take
in
its
brief,
but
simply
referred
the
court
to
this
prong
of
the
findings
as
merely
indicative
of
congress'
intent,
but
not
of
its
power.
i
submit
that
reading
of
the
congressional
history
whatever
there
is
--
i
think
the
court
below
was
collect
still
in
viewing
as
really
enacted
under
the
commerce
power.
but
even
if
that
were
not
the
case,
there
were
two
other
powers,
namely
the
power
to
protect
the
republican
form
of
government,
the
power
to
protect
rights
under
the
first
amendment
and
third
being
that
of
protecting
life
of
the
president
and
vice
president.
i
think
those
three
really
are
in
the
same
category,
namely
that
they
are
far
removed
from
what
congress'
power
really
is
in
the
premises,
namely
the
watch
(oh)
case
which
dealt
with
the
statute
enacted
to
prohibit
threats
against
the
life
of
the
president
was
a
considered
act
of
congress
on
a
very
narrow
issue
to
take
direct
action
to
say
that
the
mere
possession
of
a
weapon,
in
one's
home
is
a
threat
to
the
president
and
vice
president,
once
again
i
think
on
a
syllogistic
scheme
of
abstract
logic
might
be
defensible,
but
in
term
of
constitutional
power,
again
i
think
it
falls
short.
mr.
justice
blackmun
touched
on
the
third
point
in
our
brief
which
was
raised
in
the
courts
below,
but
not
decided
by
the
circuit
in
light
of
their
resolution
of
the
issue,
that
is
that
section
1202
(c)
in
defining
felony
for
the
predicate
conviction
in
this
case
violates
the
equal
protection
clause.
that
is
because
in
defining
felony
to
be
a
crime
other
than
misdemeanor,
punishable
by
less
than
2
years
imprisonment,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
is
entirely
correct
in
referring
to
vagaries
and
the
differentials
between
the
statute
of
the
various
states
on
crime.
for
instance,
mr.
bass
convicted
of
attempted
grand
larceny
in
the
second
degree
in
new
york
would
have
only
been
guilty
of
misdemeanor
in
california
and
in
other
state
and
yet
in
california
that
person
committing
the
same
act
in
this
case
as
mr.
bass
could
not
have
been
punished
or
prosecuted
under
the
statute.
the
issue
is
not
raised,
i
raise
it
before
this
court
because
it's
my
understanding
the
unites
state
versus
specter
that
this
court
can
if
it
wants
to
decide
the
equal
protection
issue,
if
it
feels
there
is
no
necessity
for
sending
it
back
to
the
court
of
appeals,
if
it
affirms
on
all
other
issues,
if
it
reverses
i
should
say
on
the
other
issues
in
the
case.
i
would
submit
that
in
the
interest
of
my
client
if
this
court
were
to
reverse,
i
will
then
ask
for
remand
back
to
the
circuit
for
getting
its
wisdom
on
the
equal
protection
issue,
since
it
did
not
rule
on
that
issue.
however,
just
to
recapitulate
what
i
think
this
case
involved
is
a
statute
callously
drawn,
quickly
drawn
whatever
motivation
for
its
withdrawing
there
may
be,
i
think
it
is
not
very
frequent
that
the
congress
acts
with
such
haste
in
drafting
a
statute
or
enacting
a
statue
which
affects
matters
never
before
affected
under
the
any
federal
statute.
given
that,
in
that
is
a
criminal
case
where
you
normally
apply
rule
of
narrow
construction
and
an
ambiguous
statute
with
avoids
the
constitutional
issues,
i
think
that
the
approach
taken
by
the
second
circuit
is
far
superior
to
that
taken
by
the
other
circuits
because
the
other
circuits
put
the
cart
before
the
horse.
the
eighth
and
sixth
circuits
said,
we
don't
have
any
problem
with
the
constitutional
question
at
all,
therefore,
we
will
decide
it
and
then
decide
the
statute
along
those
lines.
the
eighth
circuit
accepted
the
government’s
argument
of
redundancy.
i
think
the
government
no
longer
tendered
it
you
in
the
same
form
it
made
in
the
eighth
circuit
or
in
its
brief.
i
think
what
the
second
circuit
does,
is
it
takes
the
view
that
all
the
elements
and
even
one
that
i
did
not
--
that
i
mentioned
but
which
the
circuit
didn't
rely
on
the
narrow
construction
of
the
rule,
give
what
is
before
us
in
this
case
on
this
legislative
record
that
the
hanging
of
a
criminal
conviction
which
involves
determination
of
constitutionality
on
this
particular
defendant
makes
little
sense
and
the
commerce
clause
issue
which
i
would
point
out
was
decided
--
was
decidedly
avoided
by
the
circuit
in
this
case
was
the
same
court
albeit
different
members
of
the
penal
that
decide
the
perez
case
affirmatively
and
was
affirmed
by
this
court.
so
the
second
circuit
felt
that
perez
is
a
valid
exercise
of
constitutional
power,
but
seems
to
have
great
doubt
with
respect
to
this
case.
for
these
reasons
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes,
in
the
white
case
which
was
cited
in
the
second
circuit's
opinion
because
the
government
heavily
relied
on
it
below,
at
page
15
of
my
brief
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
cite
through
i
--
and
i
view
the
white
case
as
a
second
circuit
did
that,
the
circuit
harmonized
white
with
this
case
by
noting
that
in
sustaining
congress'
power
to
regulate
possession
of
depressant
and
stimulant
drugs
itself
recognized
the
distinct
problems
inherent
in
the
field
of
drug
regulation.
the
first
circuit
wrote
that
unlike
many
other
objects
of
federal
regulation,
the
presence
of
stimulating
drugs
are
not
passive
subjects
which
often
used
talking
to
the
realm
of
consumption.
they
exert
influence
on
consumer.
i
think
of
the
circuit
there
with
respect
to
drugs
was
concerned
with,
that
drugs
affect
who
get
on
highways
who
take
all
kinds
of
action
which
directly
keeps
the
interest
of
regulation
going,
even
though
it’s
intrastate
matter.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes
but
they
are
not,
they
are
not
injected
by
the
petitioner
or
the
defendants.
they
are
in
a
sense,
were
been
active
in
even
drugs
essentially
they
are
wholly
inactive
until
something
else
activates
them
and
i
think
the
white
is
the
tough
case.
i
think
that
the
your
honor's
question
is,
well,
could
i
think
that
the
line
of
distinction
is
primarily
i
would
only
know
also
that
the
this
court
has
not
except
we
denied
a
certain
white
made
any
ruling
on
that
issue
but
i
think
again
the
question
in
white
with
drugs
is
the
complete
flexibility
and
movement
of
drugs.
i
would
submit
even
more
flexible
and
more
effective
regulation
and
the
movement
to
represent
which
this
stature
already
does
provide
for,
namely
the
receipt
and
shipment
in
interstate
commerce
of
firearms.
i
don’t
think
that
the
drug
regulation
carries
that.
also
that
drugs
statute
is
part
of
a
general
scheme
of
regulation
that
has
interstate
policies
to
begin
with.
i
would
suggest
that
again
it
is
more
along
the
model
of
perez
in
the
consumer
credit
protection
act
than
it
is
with
respect
to
this
section.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes,
i
think
in
this
case,
your
honor,
it
is
all
things
being
equal,
the
litigation
posture
this
case,
the
record
before
the
court,
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
was
certainly
i
think
i
had
a
better
of
it
than
avoiding
entanglement
of
those
constitutional
questions.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
justice
douglas
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
our
position
that
the
court
of
appeals'
interpretation
is
sound
for
many,
many
reasons,
but
let
me
first
fire
one
bell
in
my
--
one
arrow
in
my
bow
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
find
necessary
to
even
discuss
but
which
this
court
in
similar
situation
has
discussed,
namely,
this
is
a
criminal
statute.
it's
ambiguity
is
that
conceded.
in
fact,
it
is
so
evident
by
the
differences
of
opinion
among
the
district
courts
and
a
circuit
courts
and
the
government
concedes
only
as
ambiguous
you
must
--
if
we,
we
the
government
are
right
read
out
an
entire
section
of
the
provision.
that
where
there
is
an
ambiguity
of
this
degree,
this
being
a
penal
statute,
it
should
be
narrowly
construed
in
favor
of
a
criminal
defendant.
but
turning
now
to
the
reason,
the
facts
in
support
of
court
of
appeals'
decision
is;
one
the
court
of
appeals
was
dealing
with
the
statue
as
again
the
government
concedes
was
drafted
passed
with
the
greatest
of
haste,
with
an
absence
of
legislative
concentration
and
absence
of
finding
and
no
hearing.
the
government
on
oral
argument
has
just
made
a
further
confession
which
is
not
in
it's
brief
and
in
fact
which
my
brief
is
not
a
virtue,
is
namely
the
government
no
longer
as
i
understand
their
argument,
views
the
redundancy
argument
which
should
make
the
page
16
and
17
of
its
brief
as
flowing
as
it
does
in
its
brief.
namely
the
argument
against
the
second
circuit's
opinion
was
that,
if
its
interpretation
is
adapted
then
senator
long
statute,
in
essence
the
entire
section
of
1202,
on
page
17
of
the
government
brief
they
say
it's
better
to
cut
out
just
the
commerce
transport
section.
now,
it
is
to
make
the
entire
section
too
(inaudible).
as
i
understand
the
government,
they
now
say
it
won't
be
(inaudible)
and
that
is
a
very
good
reason.
and
i
apologize
to
court
for
not
really
getting
into
with
my
brief
because
the
answer
is
so
obvious
and
it
is
prior
to
an
error
in
the
government's
brief
at
page
16
at
footnote
4,
footnote
10,
excuse
me.
footnote
10
of
the
government
brief
says
that
title
iv
extended
the
class
firstly;
who
may
not
possess
weapon
--
who
may
not
ship
or
transport
weapons
in
the
interstate
commerce.
that
is
not
so.
that
expansion
takes
place
in
title
1
of
the
gun
control
act
of
1968
which
was
passed
four
months
after
the
long
amendment.
what
you
had
at
time
the
long
passed
was
old
18,
19,
22
(f)
and
(e)
then
transformed
into
(g)
and
(h)
of
title
iv
by
title
i
of
the
1968
act.
at
the
time
of
senator
long's
amendment,
all
you
had
was
a
prohibition
against
the
shipment
or
receipt
in
interstate
commerce
by
felons.
what
senator
long's
amendment
does
is
vastly
increase
the
numbers
of
persons
who
may
not
have
weapons,
namely
persons
discharged
from
the
armed
forces
on
the
dishonorable
condition,
mentally
competent,
persons
who
have
renounced
citizenship
and
unlawful
aliens.
also
title
iv
had
a
exclusion
for
white
color
felony.
title
vii,
senator
long's
amendment
was
not.
also
senator
long's
amendment
added
the
offense
of
possession
as
title
iv
deals
only
with
the
receipt
and
shipment.
and
i
say
that
title
vii,
senator
long's
amendment
does
include
the
terms
“transport
in
commerce
or
affecting
commerce.”
so
in
essence
what
the
court
of
appeals
was
done
is
on
the
legislative
record
before
it,
taken
the
statute
which
has
terms
apart
that
a
key
constitutional
terms,
namely
“affecting
commerce”
and
has
interpreted
the
statute
without
further
guidance
in
congress
that
(a)
avoids
the
reaching
of
a
constitutional
determination
as
to
congress'
power
to
legislate
against
the
mere
receipt
and
possession
without
proof
of
a
commerce
nexus.
it
is
to
that
question
that
the
government's
position
was
before
this
court.
now
as
i
have
understood
the
doctrine
concerning
constitutional
adjudication,
it
was
applicable
not
whether
or
not
the
constitutional
question
was
decided
favorably
for
one
party
or
the
other,
but
whether
or
not
it
need
be
decided
at
all.
now,
certainly
this
case
does
not
present
the
weather
ball
for
this
court,
i
think,
to
approach
that
question.
i
think
the
--
there
two
decisions
of
this
court
which
are
so
similar
in
my
mind
that
it
forms,
sort
of,
a
litigation
model
for
how
i
as
respondent's
counsel
suggest
revolution
in
this
case
and
i
in
out
brief
call
your
honors'
attention
to
first
the
case
of
united
states
versus
denmark
which
really
should
be
captioned
united
states
versus
five
gambling
devices,
an
opinion
by
justice
jackson
and
then
the
case
last
term
of
rewis
against
united
states.
in
both
of
those
cases
all
the
elements
that
we
seek
this
court
to
appreciate
give
our
side
were
present.
you
had
two
statute
dealing
with
congress'
power
to
affect
intrastate
determination.
in
denmark
it
was
whether
mere
registration
of
gambling
devices
that
had
no
connection
with
interstate
transaction
was
to
be
required.
the
statute
as
the
court
wrote,
could
have
been
interpreted
either
way,
but
the
legislative
history
in
denmark
was
silent,
offered
the
court
no
guidance
as
to
what
the
intend
of
congress
was.
and
the
court
said
(a)
this
is
a
penal
statute,
(b)
we
do
not
have
enough
from
congress
to
make
this
determination
and
(c)
there
were
other
elements,
namely
that
when
we
are
dealing
with
intrastate
matters,
you
also
are
dealing
with
the
sensitivity
of
federal
and
state
relations
and
also
indeed
with
the
consequences
to
federal
police
enforcement
powers,
material
for
expended
congressional
involvement,
federal
involvement
in
the
ordinary
concepts
of
the
criminal
law
normally
associated
with
state
police
power.
and
in
rewis,
again
an
opinion
mr.
justice
marshall,
without
help
from
congress,
clearly
designating
what
its
intent
was
although
the
statute
was
susceptible
to
two
constructions,
the
court
given
the
nature
of
a
case
as
a
criminal
case
took
the
narrow
construction.
we
think
that
the
constitutional
issue
indicates
that
it
is
not
as
simple
as
the
government
would
have
it.
i
believe
in
the
prior
argument,
mr.
solicitor
general
used
the
phrase
that
principles
have
a
tendency
to
expand
the
limit
to
their
logic.
i
would
like
to
borrow
that
phrase
because
it
does
describe
what
i
tried
to
communicate
to
the
court
in
point
two
of
our
brief.
as
i
understand
to
those
powers
commerce
of
congress
under
the
commerce
clause
as
this
court
has
decreed
it
in
recent
years.
it
is
very
vast,
but
it
is
not
unlimited.
it
is
a
question
of
degree.
the
polish
national
alliance
versus
nlrb
case
talks
which
cite
in
our
brief
talks
in
those
term.
now,
a
question
of
the
degree
means
that
you
have
to
look
on
a
spectrum
of
conduct
and
activity
as
i
see
it,
to
say
when
is
that
question
of
degree
beyond
congress'
power
and
here
we
think,
regulation
based
on
the
haste
to
the
amendment
absence
of
binding
all
like
recognized
that
court
does
not
require
findings
on
the
question
of
constitutional
power
of
the
congress.
it
requires
as
to
look
at
what
conduct
that
the
government's
interpretation
is
right
that
congress
is
really
thinking
off.
a
mere
receipt
or
possession
of
a
weapon
in
a
man's
own
home
without
more.
no
requirement
that
the
weapon
transported
in
interstate
commerce
or
came
in
to
interstate
commerce
which
leads
me
back
again
to
another
interesting
question,
the
casey
amendment
which
was
debated
in
congress
at
length
after
this
statute
was
enacted,
thought
--
the
subject
of
that
amendment
was
to
make
it
a
crime
to
commit
a
crime
of
any
kind
with
a
weapon
that
had
traveled
in
interstate
commerce.
so,
after
you
had
congress
talking,
as
a
government
would
have
it
about
not
requiring
a
commerce
nexus,
yet
to
achieve
the
very
results
which
the
government
says
this
statute
achieves
there
is
still
lengthy
debate
on
amendment
that
was
preceded.
but
returning
to
the
spectrum
of
criminal
conduct,
what
you
have
essentially
is
a
passive
act,
and
the
word
act
is
even
possibly
a
misnomer,
a
passive
state
of
affairs,
a
weapon
in
a
man's
home,
lying
dormant
and
not
affecting
anything.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
mr.
justice
douglas
and
may
it
please
the
court.
to
pick
up
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
the
redundancy
question,
the
redundancy
of
title
vii
and
title
iv
and
just
add
a
thought
about
why
i
think
that
even
if
there
is
a
slight
redundancy
in
language
with
respect
to
dealing
in
title
vii
interpretation
of
the
circuit
print
on
it
that
essentially
it
is
giving
what
congress
really
would
like
to
have
in
title
vii.
i
think
if
you
read
the
legislate
history
of
title
vii
and
the
provision
in
addition
to
1202
(a)
(1)
dealing
with
aliens,
with
mental
incompetence,
with
dishonorably
discharged
persons,
you
will
see
that
the
conceptual
natural
of
title
vii
and
i
think
what
senator
long
wanted
to
have
enacted
and
what
congress
i
think
believed
it
was
enacting
albeit
hastily
was
essentially
an
assassin
bill
that
up
to
that
time
the
congress
had
concerned
itself
merely
with
felons
and
weapons,
but
given
the
assassination
of
president
kennedy,
the
assassination
dr.
martin
luther
king,
you
can
tell
from
the
legislative
record,
brief
as
it
is
that
this
was
what
was
at
issue
when
this
bill
was
passed.
that
there
was
a
feeling
by
senator
long
on
getting
to
the
question
of
assassins
and
people
who
were
irresponsible
and
proscribing
them
from
having
weapons.
with
that
in
mind,
i
think
court,
i
must
have
for
the
constitutional
issue
to
convince
your
honors
that
it
is
serious
enough
to
at
least
forestall
decision
upon
it
until
the
case
presents
the
necessity
for
it.
this
is
not
that
case.
as
i
stated
earlier,
the
question
is
one
of
the
degree,
the
congress'
power
and
i
think
that
the
degree
must,
of
course,
be
very
far
removed
for
me
to
convince
you
that
congress
does
not
have
the
power.
but
i
think
as
i
said
on
the
spectrum
of
criminal
conduct,
the
mere
suggestion
of
a
weapon
goes
to
the
utmost
of
that
degree
wherein
congress
may
not
reach
because
it
is
essentially
a
passive
act
regulated
by
most
of
the
laws
of
the
states,
even
when
committed
by
a
man
with
a
prior
felony.
perez
of
course
is
a
tough
case,
but
i
do
not
believe
it
is
indistinguishable.
i
believe
if
anything
it
points
a
way
to
resolution
in
our
favor
of
the
issue
here
if
that
issue
must
be
decided.
as
mr.
justice
blackmun
pointed
out,
the
spectrum
of
mr.
pauley's
argument,
i
think
the
thrust
of
his
question
was
that,
doesn't
perez
have
within
it
a
replete,
replete
with
interstate
commerce
nexus.
the
statute,
the
consumer
title
ii
of
the
consumer
credit
protection
act
found
that
organized
crime
itself
was
interstate
and
international
character
and
that
a
substantial
part
of
the
income
of
organized
crime
was
generated
by
extortion
of
credit
transactions.
subdivision
3
of
that
section
found
that
extortion
of
credit
transactions
are
carried
on
to
a
substantial
extent
in
the
state
and
foreign
commerce
and
to
remove
instrumentally
of
such
commerce
and
then
it
fostered
out
the
ancillary
group
of
intrastate
no
trafficking
activities.
i
read
perez
as
a
traditional
commerce
clause
case
in
the
sense
that
congress
had
opted
to
regulate,
invoke
conduct
that
was
commercial,
but
in
essence
was
intrastate
in
character.
it
was
no
different
then
wickard
versus
filburn
where
simply
because
there
was
a
local
wheat
raising,
the
entire
scheme
of
regulation,
that
was
interstate
in
nature,
it
could
not
be
--
could
not
include
the
affected
of
that
intrastate
wheat
raising,
the
same
as
i
read
perez.
the
thrust
of
the
entire
title
iv
of
the
consumer
credit
protection
act
was
to
regulate
organize
crime,
was
to
regulate
interstate
transactions
and
to
bring
into
that
regulation
those
intrastate
activities
that
were
ancillary
and
of
course
would
affect
the
efficiency
and
effectiveness
of
the
total
essence
of
regulation.
there
is
no
such
class
of
activity
here
in
terms
of
gun
possession,
mere
gun
possession
or
receipt
by
a
felon
that
is
the
same
will
have
any
colliery
to
the
consumer
credit
protection
act
because
there
is
only
class
of
activity
and
i
think
that
is
key
phrase
in
commerce
clause
motivation.
here
is
the
class
of
activities
is
simply
the
unit
of
the
local
possession
and
receipt.
there
is
no
larger
units
of
interstate
regulation
in
the
terms
of
effect
on
commerce.
so,
that
congress,
if
the
government
is
correct,
has
opted
to
regulate
something
that
is
not
part
of
an
interstate
regulation
scheme,
but
starts
out
as
intrastate
and
ends
being
intrastate
and
i
think
that
the
language,
justice
hugo
employed
in
dissent
in
perez,
although
not
shared
by
the
other
members
of
the
court,
is
the
kind
that
the
language
that
commends
itself
to
resolution
here
because
if
this
statute
would
be
sustained
as
a
proper
exercise
the
commerce
power,
mainly
mere
possession
on
the
theory
that
your
possession
would
then
prompt
an
act
and
the
act
itself
would
affect
commerce,
namely
the
robbery
or
the
larceny,
that
congress
can
rightfully
regulate
the
possession.
with
that
as
your
common
denominator,
mere
possession,
what
you
have
is
the
ability
of
the
congress
to
regulate
any
type
of
crime,
nearly
any
type
of
crimes
so
long
as
the
logical
extension
is
that
somewhere
beyond
the
crime
commerce
will
be
affected.
now,
once
again
talking
about
the
expended
logic
will
open
that
case.
i
could
not
on
a
some
logistic
basis
deny
that
some
men
with
a
gun
might
then
opt
to
use
that
gun
to
commit
a
crime
which
then
might
bring
itself
within
new
realm
of
statistical
materials
that
the
government
offers
to
you
as
a
rationale
basis.
but
that
i
think
really
extends
the
commerce
power
quite
a
bit
too
far
and
it's
interesting
that
the
congress
has
not
yet
attempted
to
regulate
the
act
of
crime
which
would
directly
affect
interstate
commerce
or
even
indirectly
affect
interstate
commerce.
a
robbery,
a
larceny
and
yet
it
has
--
if
the
government
is
correct
opted
to
jump
over
those
acts
and
go
right
to
the
mere
possession
which
may
or
may
not
have
any
affect
that
all
on
interstate
commerce.
i
think
in
that
context
the
perez
decision
does
not
point
a
way
for
an
easy
resolution
of
the
constitutional
issue
in
this
case.
unless
is
to
say
a
especially
in
a
case
where
there
are
no
findings,
there
are
no
hearings
that
congress
may
simply
designate
passive
criminal
conduct
and
again
i
use
the
word
conduct
cautiously,
they
simply
designate
that,
posit
that
since
crimes
are
committed
with
weapons,
albeit
local
crimes
that
then,
therefore,
there
was
federal
power
to
regulate
and
i
would
suggest
that
before
congress
goes
that
far
it
ought
to
at
least
take
intermediate
step
and
have
the
question
presented
whether
the
regulation
of
a
mere
act
of
robbery
could
be
properly
within
the
federal
scope.
in
this
case,
it
does
not.
the
government's
position
in
short
i
submit
is
really
conjectural
one
that
absent
findings
or
hearings
or
finding
as
there
are,
but
absent
hearings,
the
statistics
which
the
government
posits
really
are
of
no
help
to
the
court
as
i
see
it
because
they
in
a
way
prove
too
much
and
i
should
say
that
in
the
sense
that
they
don't
prove
anything
at
all,
to
say
that
commerce
is
affected
by
large
amount
of
robberies
and
larcenies
does
not
get
you
to
the
point
where
you
can
simply
resolve
a
constitutional
question
of
the
possession
of
the
weapon
as
being
not
connected
to
commerce.
absent,
any
kind
of
explication
by
congress
of
the
relevancy
of
mere
weapon's
possession
by
a
very
narrow,
limited
group
of
personnel
for
a
selling
and
its
connection
to
commerce,
i
see
very
little
basis
on
the
record
before
this
court,
both
in
this
case
and
the
legislative
record
for
taking
that
serious
step
of
expansion
under
the
commerce
clause.
again,
i
say
that
i
do
not
think
i
have
to
convince
you
that
the
step
for
not
be
taking
of
that
--
and
i
do
believe
that
it
is
unconstitutional
for
congress
to
that
this
far,
but
i
always
seek
to
convince
that
there
is
a
serious
issue,
which
the
construction
given
in
the
statute
by
the
court
of
appeals
can
help
you
avoid
deciding
that
question
on
this
particular
record
and
in
this
particular
case.
now
the
government
in
its
oral
argument,
but
not
in
it's
brief
choose
for
the
first
time
to
rely
on
the
power
of
congress
to
protect
the
vice
president
and
the
president
as
a
means
for
sustaining
the
statute.
this
was
a
position
taken
by
judge
franco,
although
rather
personally
and
the
government
does
not
--
did
not
take
in
its
brief,
but
simply
referred
the
court
to
this
prong
of
the
findings
as
merely
indicative
of
congress'
intent,
but
not
of
its
power.
i
submit
that
reading
of
the
congressional
history
whatever
there
is
--
i
think
the
court
below
was
collect
still
in
viewing
as
really
enacted
under
the
commerce
power.
but
even
if
that
were
not
the
case,
there
were
two
other
powers,
namely
the
power
to
protect
the
republican
form
of
government,
the
power
to
protect
rights
under
the
first
amendment
and
third
being
that
of
protecting
life
of
the
president
and
vice
president.
i
think
those
three
really
are
in
the
same
category,
namely
that
they
are
far
removed
from
what
congress'
power
really
is
in
the
premises,
namely
the
watch
(oh)
case
which
dealt
with
the
statute
enacted
to
prohibit
threats
against
the
life
of
the
president
was
a
considered
act
of
congress
on
a
very
narrow
issue
to
take
direct
action
to
say
that
the
mere
possession
of
a
weapon,
in
one's
home
is
a
threat
to
the
president
and
vice
president,
once
again
i
think
on
a
syllogistic
scheme
of
abstract
logic
might
be
defensible,
but
in
term
of
constitutional
power,
again
i
think
it
falls
short.
mr.
justice
blackmun
touched
on
the
third
point
in
our
brief
which
was
raised
in
the
courts
below,
but
not
decided
by
the
circuit
in
light
of
their
resolution
of
the
issue,
that
is
that
section
1202
(c)
in
defining
felony
for
the
predicate
conviction
in
this
case
violates
the
equal
protection
clause.
that
is
because
in
defining
felony
to
be
a
crime
other
than
misdemeanor,
punishable
by
less
than
2
years
imprisonment,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
is
entirely
correct
in
referring
to
vagaries
and
the
differentials
between
the
statute
of
the
various
states
on
crime.
for
instance,
mr.
bass
convicted
of
attempted
grand
larceny
in
the
second
degree
in
new
york
would
have
only
been
guilty
of
misdemeanor
in
california
and
in
other
state
and
yet
in
california
that
person
committing
the
same
act
in
this
case
as
mr.
bass
could
not
have
been
punished
or
prosecuted
under
the
statute.
the
issue
is
not
raised,
i
raise
it
before
this
court
because
it's
my
understanding
the
unites
state
versus
specter
that
this
court
can
if
it
wants
to
decide
the
equal
protection
issue,
if
it
feels
there
is
no
necessity
for
sending
it
back
to
the
court
of
appeals,
if
it
affirms
on
all
other
issues,
if
it
reverses
i
should
say
on
the
other
issues
in
the
case.
i
would
submit
that
in
the
interest
of
my
client
if
this
court
were
to
reverse,
i
will
then
ask
for
remand
back
to
the
circuit
for
getting
its
wisdom
on
the
equal
protection
issue,
since
it
did
not
rule
on
that
issue.
however,
just
to
recapitulate
what
i
think
this
case
involved
is
a
statute
callously
drawn,
quickly
drawn
whatever
motivation
for
its
withdrawing
there
may
be,
i
think
it
is
not
very
frequent
that
the
congress
acts
with
such
haste
in
drafting
a
statute
or
enacting
a
statue
which
affects
matters
never
before
affected
under
the
any
federal
statute.
given
that,
in
that
is
a
criminal
case
where
you
normally
apply
rule
of
narrow
construction
and
an
ambiguous
statute
with
avoids
the
constitutional
issues,
i
think
that
the
approach
taken
by
the
second
circuit
is
far
superior
to
that
taken
by
the
other
circuits
because
the
other
circuits
put
the
cart
before
the
horse.
the
eighth
and
sixth
circuits
said,
we
don't
have
any
problem
with
the
constitutional
question
at
all,
therefore,
we
will
decide
it
and
then
decide
the
statute
along
those
lines.
the
eighth
circuit
accepted
the
government’s
argument
of
redundancy.
i
think
the
government
no
longer
tendered
it
you
in
the
same
form
it
made
in
the
eighth
circuit
or
in
its
brief.
i
think
what
the
second
circuit
does,
is
it
takes
the
view
that
all
the
elements
and
even
one
that
i
did
not
--
that
i
mentioned
but
which
the
circuit
didn't
rely
on
the
narrow
construction
of
the
rule,
give
what
is
before
us
in
this
case
on
this
legislative
record
that
the
hanging
of
a
criminal
conviction
which
involves
determination
of
constitutionality
on
this
particular
defendant
makes
little
sense
and
the
commerce
clause
issue
which
i
would
point
out
was
decided
--
was
decidedly
avoided
by
the
circuit
in
this
case
was
the
same
court
albeit
different
members
of
the
penal
that
decide
the
perez
case
affirmatively
and
was
affirmed
by
this
court.
so
the
second
circuit
felt
that
perez
is
a
valid
exercise
of
constitutional
power,
but
seems
to
have
great
doubt
with
respect
to
this
case.
for
these
reasons
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes,
in
the
white
case
which
was
cited
in
the
second
circuit's
opinion
because
the
government
heavily
relied
on
it
below,
at
page
15
of
my
brief
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
cite
through
i
--
and
i
view
the
white
case
as
a
second
circuit
did
that,
the
circuit
harmonized
white
with
this
case
by
noting
that
in
sustaining
congress'
power
to
regulate
possession
of
depressant
and
stimulant
drugs
itself
recognized
the
distinct
problems
inherent
in
the
field
of
drug
regulation.
the
first
circuit
wrote
that
unlike
many
other
objects
of
federal
regulation,
the
presence
of
stimulating
drugs
are
not
passive
subjects
which
often
used
talking
to
the
realm
of
consumption.
they
exert
influence
on
consumer.
i
think
of
the
circuit
there
with
respect
to
drugs
was
concerned
with,
that
drugs
affect
who
get
on
highways
who
take
all
kinds
of
action
which
directly
keeps
the
interest
of
regulation
going,
even
though
it’s
intrastate
matter.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes
but
they
are
not,
they
are
not
injected
by
the
petitioner
or
the
defendants.
they
are
in
a
sense,
were
been
active
in
even
drugs
essentially
they
are
wholly
inactive
until
something
else
activates
them
and
i
think
the
white
is
the
tough
case.
i
think
that
the
your
honor's
question
is,
well,
could
i
think
that
the
line
of
distinction
is
primarily
i
would
only
know
also
that
the
this
court
has
not
except
we
denied
a
certain
white
made
any
ruling
on
that
issue
but
i
think
again
the
question
in
white
with
drugs
is
the
complete
flexibility
and
movement
of
drugs.
i
would
submit
even
more
flexible
and
more
effective
regulation
and
the
movement
to
represent
which
this
stature
already
does
provide
for,
namely
the
receipt
and
shipment
in
interstate
commerce
of
firearms.
i
don’t
think
that
the
drug
regulation
carries
that.
also
that
drugs
statute
is
part
of
a
general
scheme
of
regulation
that
has
interstate
policies
to
begin
with.
i
would
suggest
that
again
it
is
more
along
the
model
of
perez
in
the
consumer
credit
protection
act
than
it
is
with
respect
to
this
section.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes,
i
think
in
this
case,
your
honor,
it
is
all
things
being
equal,
the
litigation
posture
this
case,
the
record
before
the
court,
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
was
certainly
i
think
i
had
a
better
of
it
than
avoiding
entanglement
of
those
constitutional
questions.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
thank
you,
your
honor.
