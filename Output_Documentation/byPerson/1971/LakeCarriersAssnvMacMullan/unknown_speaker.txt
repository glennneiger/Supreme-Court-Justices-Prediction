unknown
speaker
what’s
the
basis
for
you
saying
that
mr.
elder,
if
the
state
of
michigan
says
otherwise,
is
it
the
federal
statute?
unknown
speaker
why
does
it,
when
the
federal
regulations
don’t
become
applicable
to
existing
vessels
until
a
future
time?
unknown
speaker
isn’t
that
a
problem
which
exists
regardless
of
the
pending
federal
regulations?
unknown
speaker
you
said
that
we
ought
to
do
this
and
we
ought
to
do
that
but
i
mean
isn’t
that
not
basically
a
policy
judgment
that
is
up
to
the
judgment
of
legislature
in
the
first
instance
rather
than
of
the
private
carrier?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
your
concern
is
that
the
michigan
law
specified
one
form
of
solution.
new
york
perhaps
another,
illinois
is
still
a
third
and
if
you
are
subject
only
to
the
federal
regulation
that
then
there
be
a
single
specification.
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
can’t
the
ship
arrange,
the
shipping
company
with
its
own
funds
to
put
in
pumping-out
station
in
duluth
or
in
chicago?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
saying
it’s
a
financial
burden?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
pump-out
stations
in
your
homeport?
unknown
speaker
of
course
the
three-judge
district
court
didn’t
rule
against
these
claims
used
on
the
merits,
they
just
said
you
should
raise
them
in
the
michigan
court?
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
civil
proceeding
of
any
kind
here?
unknown
speaker
so
you
could
start
a
state
declaratory
judgment?
unknown
speaker
if
there
is
no
controversy
in
federal
court
you
are
out
of
court
anyway?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
three-judge
court
did
not
say
there
was
no
controversy?
unknown
speaker
yes
they
did,
that
all
three-judge
court
issue
on
preempt
is
true
and
that
as
to
the
other
issue
there
is
no
case
for
controversy?
unknown
speaker
don’t
you
think
then
you
have
to
address
yourselves
to
what
is
a
case
of
controversy?
unknown
speaker
yes.
but
you
can’t
have
a
federal
declaratory
judgments
action
without
a
case
of
controversy,
can
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
haven’t.
what
is
it?
unknown
speaker
have
they
actually
demanded
to
get?
have
they
suggested
it?
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
that
the
adversary
situation
has
developed
to
the
point
where
there
is
adverse
symptom?
unknown
speaker
apparently
everyone
concedes
that
when
the
federal
rules
come
out
there
will
be
preempts.
unknown
speaker
now,
the
federal
rules
haven’t
come
out?
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
put
in
the
holding
tanks
and
then
the
federal
act
comes
out
with
different
requirements
and
preempts
then
you
will
have
to
comply
with
the
federal
act?
unknown
speaker
you
have
five
years
though
for
existing
vessel.
don’t
you
under
the
--
from
the
date
of
promulgation
that
--
unknown
speaker
and
once
you
get
the
law?
unknown
speaker
so
the
five
years
is
for
your
protection
not
the
state?
unknown
speaker
five
years
to
comply
though
with
the
federal
order?
unknown
speaker
which
are
you
suppose
to
comply
with
in
this
five
years.
say
the
standard
federal
standards
come
out.
are
you
supposed
to
comply
with
federal
standards
right
away?
or
do
you
have
a
five-year
grace
period?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
i
understand,
yes.
but
you
have
five
years
to
change
over
from
state
regulation
with
federal?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that
but
in
part
of
the
federal
system.
unknown
speaker
you
don’t
think
--
let’s
assume
congress
pass
a
law
and
it
says,
carrier
still
live
up
to
the
diverse
state
laws,
however
different
thing
may
be
for
five
years,
at
the
end
of
five
years,
there
will
be
a
uniform
standard.
unknown
speaker
but
why,
has
the
congress
got
plenary
control
over
interstate
commerce?
and
if
permits
states
to
regulate
what
might
not
otherwise
be
regulated
by
the
state?
unknown
speaker
don’t
you
think
that
federal
--
that
the
law
by
saying
that
five
years
preempts
of
the
late
five
years
is
in
effect
the
congressional
statements
that
state
law
shall
control
these
lines?
unknown
speaker
and
meanwhile
the
states
can’t
do
anything.
is
this
based
on
a
rapidly
argument
or
generally
present
on
preemption
--
unknown
speaker
that’s
on
your
admiralty
argument?
unknown
speaker
superficially,
you
run
up
against
heron-schmidt
(ph)
case,
don’t
you?
unknown
speaker
it
didn’t
say
so,
it
said
it
was
talking
about
inner
core
of
the
police
power
unless
that’s
the
opinion
said.
unknown
speaker
keep
back
down?
unknown
speaker
because
the
claim
in
that
case
was
that
it
would
require
structural
law
alterations?
unknown
speaker
well
as
to
criminal
prosecution?
unknown
speaker
footnotes
on.
unknown
speaker
mr.
derengoski.
unknown
speaker
does
michigan
claim
the
right
under
police
power
to
impose
these
regulations
say
on
or
both
coming
from
duluth
to
chicago
on
the
middle
of
lake
michigan?
unknown
speaker
what’s
your
definition
of
michigan
waters?
unknown
speaker
so
wisconsin
has
jurisdiction
over
the
west
side
of
the
lake
michigan
and
rest
then
michigan
have
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor.
unknown
speaker
on
the
50
vessels
that
have
treatment
facilities,
do
they
compare
with
the
treatment
facilities
of
the
city
of
detroit?
unknown
speaker
if
they
did
setup
a
secondary
system
as
good
as
detroit
they
still
couldn’t
use
it?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
you
can’t
control
that
in
the
middle
of
the
lake
anyway.
you
can
only
control
the
michigan
water.
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
you
had
the
tanks
that
you
require
here
and
they
still
dumped
it,
you
would
have
the
same
problem.
i
don’t
think
that
is
an
answer
to
my
question.
my
question
is,
if
the
water
that
they
send
out
after
all
of
their
facilities
is
just
as
clean
as
the
water
dumped
from
detroit.
why
do
they
have
to
have
the
tank?
unknown
speaker
but
these
were
same
passages
that
come
from
detroit,
aren’t
they?
unknown
speaker
well,
and
that
after
the
treatment
is
made,
that
goes
into
the
michigan
water,
lake
of
michigan?
unknown
speaker
is
that
just
with
the
offense
under
the
michigan
criminal
statute,
the
failure
to
provide
the
retention
facilities
or
the
dumping
in
michigan
waters?
unknown
speaker
and
what
is
the
penalty?
unknown
speaker
so
it’s
much
cheaper
to
incur
the
penalty
than
to
comply?
unknown
speaker
one
last
question.
your
boundary
problem
is
really
no
different
than
that
tendant
upon,
for
example,
to
mississippi
river
as
between
joining
states.
unknown
speaker
mr.
derengoski,
the
court
below
apparently
felt
there
was
no
case
or
controversy.
but
what
is
michigan’s
position
or
plan
with
respect
to
enforcement
as
criminal
statute.
it’s
on
the
books
now,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
what
are
you
going
to
do?
suppose
this
court
affirms
the
judgment
law?
what
are
you
going
to
do
time
wise
with
respect
to
--
unknown
speaker
do
you
believe
that
completely
after
the
--
unknown
speaker
but
you
are
insisting
that
the
carriers
get
ready
to
perform
because
perhaps
--
unknown
speaker
because
if
you
wait
until
pump-out
stations
are
ready
to
begin
installing
tanks
then
there
will
be
another
great
delay.
unknown
speaker
so
you
have
a
rather
concrete
confrontation
with
these
carriers
now,
don’t
you?
unknown
speaker
under
the
michigan
law,
who
will
be
responsible
for
providing
pump-out
stations?
the
carriers
or
michigan?
unknown
speaker
did
i
understand
you
correctly
that
if
the
federal
regulations
were
now
effective,
fully
effective,
say
the
five
years
or
the
three
years
and
whatever
it
is
that
run
fully
effective.
do
the
federal
regulations
say
state
law?
unknown
speaker
and
you
mean
you
would
be
preempted?
unknown
speaker
or
you
would
be
preempted
but
in
the
sense
but
let's
assume
that
the
federal
law
permits
discharge
in
the
lakes.
that
you
would
be
complying
with
the
federal
law,
if
you
have
treatment
facilities
aboard
and
dumped
only
effluent
that
complied
with
federal
standards?
unknown
speaker
alright
but
if
you
complied
with
federal
law
would
that
be
all
you
had
to
do?
in
short,
would
your
michigan
requirement
be
preempted,
would
the
ships
still
has
to
have
--
could
michigan
still
insist
that
the
ships
have
their
holding
tanks?
unknown
speaker
well,
a
moment
ago
you
said
that
federal
regulations
say
that
michigan
--
that
the
michigan
holding
tank
requirement
would
satisfy
federal
law?
unknown
speaker
well
if
it
would
satisfy
federal
law,
it
means
that
it
would
be
--
it
doesn’t
mean
that
it
is
not
in
conflict
with
federal
law?
unknown
speaker
yes.
but
what
if
one
--
unknown
speaker
all
right.
well
i
will
put
it
the
other
way.
suppose
you
complied
with
federal
law
and
then
michigan
brought
a
criminal
suit,
brought
a
criminal
action
against
one
of
the
carriers
saying
you
don’t
have
holding
tanks.
would
michigan
be
permitted
to
do
that
under
the
federal?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
clear
that
the
federal
law
will
forbid
anymore
stringent
regulations
certainly
with
forbidden
less
stringent
regulation?
unknown
speaker
well
doesn’t
the
act
of
1970
provide
for
preemption?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn’t
that
the
answer
then
and
michigan
completely
preempted
that?
unknown
speaker
you
could
not
enforce
your
criminal
statute?
unknown
speaker
mr.
elder.
unknown
speaker
do
you
say
this
court
never
reached
in
the
harmen
case,
are
you
suggesting
that
harman
case
has
surely
been
decided
differently
than
it
was
or
that
in
fact
wasn’t
present
in
the
harman
case.
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
untrue
on
the
st.
mary’s
river
or
the
other
streams
that
comprise
the
path
from
duluth
to
buffalo?
unknown
speaker
mr.
elder.
how
long
have
your
vessels
been
plying
the
great
lakes?
unknown
speaker
the
companies.
unknown
speaker
that
is
70
or
80
years,
never
done
anything
about
this
problem?
unknown
speaker
what’s
the
basis
for
you
saying
that
mr.
elder,
if
the
state
of
michigan
says
otherwise,
is
it
the
federal
statute?
unknown
speaker
why
does
it,
when
the
federal
regulations
don’t
become
applicable
to
existing
vessels
until
a
future
time?
unknown
speaker
isn’t
that
a
problem
which
exists
regardless
of
the
pending
federal
regulations?
unknown
speaker
you
said
that
we
ought
to
do
this
and
we
ought
to
do
that
but
i
mean
isn’t
that
not
basically
a
policy
judgment
that
is
up
to
the
judgment
of
legislature
in
the
first
instance
rather
than
of
the
private
carrier?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
your
concern
is
that
the
michigan
law
specified
one
form
of
solution.
new
york
perhaps
another,
illinois
is
still
a
third
and
if
you
are
subject
only
to
the
federal
regulation
that
then
there
be
a
single
specification.
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
can’t
the
ship
arrange,
the
shipping
company
with
its
own
funds
to
put
in
pumping-out
station
in
duluth
or
in
chicago?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
saying
it’s
a
financial
burden?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
pump-out
stations
in
your
homeport?
unknown
speaker
of
course
the
three-judge
district
court
didn’t
rule
against
these
claims
used
on
the
merits,
they
just
said
you
should
raise
them
in
the
michigan
court?
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
civil
proceeding
of
any
kind
here?
unknown
speaker
so
you
could
start
a
state
declaratory
judgment?
unknown
speaker
if
there
is
no
controversy
in
federal
court
you
are
out
of
court
anyway?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
three-judge
court
did
not
say
there
was
no
controversy?
unknown
speaker
yes
they
did,
that
all
three-judge
court
issue
on
preempt
is
true
and
that
as
to
the
other
issue
there
is
no
case
for
controversy?
unknown
speaker
don’t
you
think
then
you
have
to
address
yourselves
to
what
is
a
case
of
controversy?
unknown
speaker
yes.
but
you
can’t
have
a
federal
declaratory
judgments
action
without
a
case
of
controversy,
can
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
haven’t.
what
is
it?
unknown
speaker
have
they
actually
demanded
to
get?
have
they
suggested
it?
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
that
the
adversary
situation
has
developed
to
the
point
where
there
is
adverse
symptom?
unknown
speaker
apparently
everyone
concedes
that
when
the
federal
rules
come
out
there
will
be
preempts.
unknown
speaker
now,
the
federal
rules
haven’t
come
out?
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
put
in
the
holding
tanks
and
then
the
federal
act
comes
out
with
different
requirements
and
preempts
then
you
will
have
to
comply
with
the
federal
act?
unknown
speaker
you
have
five
years
though
for
existing
vessel.
don’t
you
under
the
--
from
the
date
of
promulgation
that
--
unknown
speaker
and
once
you
get
the
law?
unknown
speaker
so
the
five
years
is
for
your
protection
not
the
state?
unknown
speaker
five
years
to
comply
though
with
the
federal
order?
unknown
speaker
which
are
you
suppose
to
comply
with
in
this
five
years.
say
the
standard
federal
standards
come
out.
are
you
supposed
to
comply
with
federal
standards
right
away?
or
do
you
have
a
five-year
grace
period?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
i
understand,
yes.
but
you
have
five
years
to
change
over
from
state
regulation
with
federal?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that
but
in
part
of
the
federal
system.
unknown
speaker
you
don’t
think
--
let’s
assume
congress
pass
a
law
and
it
says,
carrier
still
live
up
to
the
diverse
state
laws,
however
different
thing
may
be
for
five
years,
at
the
end
of
five
years,
there
will
be
a
uniform
standard.
unknown
speaker
but
why,
has
the
congress
got
plenary
control
over
interstate
commerce?
and
if
permits
states
to
regulate
what
might
not
otherwise
be
regulated
by
the
state?
unknown
speaker
don’t
you
think
that
federal
--
that
the
law
by
saying
that
five
years
preempts
of
the
late
five
years
is
in
effect
the
congressional
statements
that
state
law
shall
control
these
lines?
unknown
speaker
and
meanwhile
the
states
can’t
do
anything.
is
this
based
on
a
rapidly
argument
or
generally
present
on
preemption
--
unknown
speaker
that’s
on
your
admiralty
argument?
unknown
speaker
superficially,
you
run
up
against
heron-schmidt
(ph)
case,
don’t
you?
unknown
speaker
it
didn’t
say
so,
it
said
it
was
talking
about
inner
core
of
the
police
power
unless
that’s
the
opinion
said.
unknown
speaker
keep
back
down?
unknown
speaker
because
the
claim
in
that
case
was
that
it
would
require
structural
law
alterations?
unknown
speaker
well
as
to
criminal
prosecution?
unknown
speaker
footnotes
on.
unknown
speaker
mr.
derengoski.
unknown
speaker
does
michigan
claim
the
right
under
police
power
to
impose
these
regulations
say
on
or
both
coming
from
duluth
to
chicago
on
the
middle
of
lake
michigan?
unknown
speaker
what’s
your
definition
of
michigan
waters?
unknown
speaker
so
wisconsin
has
jurisdiction
over
the
west
side
of
the
lake
michigan
and
rest
then
michigan
have
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor.
unknown
speaker
on
the
50
vessels
that
have
treatment
facilities,
do
they
compare
with
the
treatment
facilities
of
the
city
of
detroit?
unknown
speaker
if
they
did
setup
a
secondary
system
as
good
as
detroit
they
still
couldn’t
use
it?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
you
can’t
control
that
in
the
middle
of
the
lake
anyway.
you
can
only
control
the
michigan
water.
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
you
had
the
tanks
that
you
require
here
and
they
still
dumped
it,
you
would
have
the
same
problem.
i
don’t
think
that
is
an
answer
to
my
question.
my
question
is,
if
the
water
that
they
send
out
after
all
of
their
facilities
is
just
as
clean
as
the
water
dumped
from
detroit.
why
do
they
have
to
have
the
tank?
unknown
speaker
but
these
were
same
passages
that
come
from
detroit,
aren’t
they?
unknown
speaker
well,
and
that
after
the
treatment
is
made,
that
goes
into
the
michigan
water,
lake
of
michigan?
unknown
speaker
is
that
just
with
the
offense
under
the
michigan
criminal
statute,
the
failure
to
provide
the
retention
facilities
or
the
dumping
in
michigan
waters?
unknown
speaker
and
what
is
the
penalty?
unknown
speaker
so
it’s
much
cheaper
to
incur
the
penalty
than
to
comply?
unknown
speaker
one
last
question.
your
boundary
problem
is
really
no
different
than
that
tendant
upon,
for
example,
to
mississippi
river
as
between
joining
states.
unknown
speaker
mr.
derengoski,
the
court
below
apparently
felt
there
was
no
case
or
controversy.
but
what
is
michigan’s
position
or
plan
with
respect
to
enforcement
as
criminal
statute.
it’s
on
the
books
now,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
what
are
you
going
to
do?
suppose
this
court
affirms
the
judgment
law?
what
are
you
going
to
do
time
wise
with
respect
to
--
unknown
speaker
do
you
believe
that
completely
after
the
--
unknown
speaker
but
you
are
insisting
that
the
carriers
get
ready
to
perform
because
perhaps
--
unknown
speaker
because
if
you
wait
until
pump-out
stations
are
ready
to
begin
installing
tanks
then
there
will
be
another
great
delay.
unknown
speaker
so
you
have
a
rather
concrete
confrontation
with
these
carriers
now,
don’t
you?
unknown
speaker
under
the
michigan
law,
who
will
be
responsible
for
providing
pump-out
stations?
the
carriers
or
michigan?
unknown
speaker
did
i
understand
you
correctly
that
if
the
federal
regulations
were
now
effective,
fully
effective,
say
the
five
years
or
the
three
years
and
whatever
it
is
that
run
fully
effective.
do
the
federal
regulations
say
state
law?
unknown
speaker
and
you
mean
you
would
be
preempted?
unknown
speaker
or
you
would
be
preempted
but
in
the
sense
but
let's
assume
that
the
federal
law
permits
discharge
in
the
lakes.
that
you
would
be
complying
with
the
federal
law,
if
you
have
treatment
facilities
aboard
and
dumped
only
effluent
that
complied
with
federal
standards?
unknown
speaker
alright
but
if
you
complied
with
federal
law
would
that
be
all
you
had
to
do?
in
short,
would
your
michigan
requirement
be
preempted,
would
the
ships
still
has
to
have
--
could
michigan
still
insist
that
the
ships
have
their
holding
tanks?
unknown
speaker
well,
a
moment
ago
you
said
that
federal
regulations
say
that
michigan
--
that
the
michigan
holding
tank
requirement
would
satisfy
federal
law?
unknown
speaker
well
if
it
would
satisfy
federal
law,
it
means
that
it
would
be
--
it
doesn’t
mean
that
it
is
not
in
conflict
with
federal
law?
unknown
speaker
yes.
but
what
if
one
--
unknown
speaker
all
right.
well
i
will
put
it
the
other
way.
suppose
you
complied
with
federal
law
and
then
michigan
brought
a
criminal
suit,
brought
a
criminal
action
against
one
of
the
carriers
saying
you
don’t
have
holding
tanks.
would
michigan
be
permitted
to
do
that
under
the
federal?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
clear
that
the
federal
law
will
forbid
anymore
stringent
regulations
certainly
with
forbidden
less
stringent
regulation?
unknown
speaker
well
doesn’t
the
act
of
1970
provide
for
preemption?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn’t
that
the
answer
then
and
michigan
completely
preempted
that?
unknown
speaker
you
could
not
enforce
your
criminal
statute?
unknown
speaker
mr.
elder.
unknown
speaker
do
you
say
this
court
never
reached
in
the
harmen
case,
are
you
suggesting
that
harman
case
has
surely
been
decided
differently
than
it
was
or
that
in
fact
wasn’t
present
in
the
harman
case.
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
untrue
on
the
st.
mary’s
river
or
the
other
streams
that
comprise
the
path
from
duluth
to
buffalo?
unknown
speaker
mr.
elder.
how
long
have
your
vessels
been
plying
the
great
lakes?
unknown
speaker
the
companies.
unknown
speaker
that
is
70
or
80
years,
never
done
anything
about
this
problem?
