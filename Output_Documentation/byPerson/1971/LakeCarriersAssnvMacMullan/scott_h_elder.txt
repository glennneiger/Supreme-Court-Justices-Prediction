mr.
scott
h.
elder
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
i
suppose
our
plea
here
is
really
quite
simple
when
you
boil
everything
down.
what’s
involved
is
basically
a
fleet
of
vessels
navigating
the
great
lakes.
these
vessels
trade
throughout
some
eight
separate
states
in
interstate
and
foreign
commerce
and
two
provinces
of
canada.
now
we’re
involved
with
a
somewhat
emotional
issue
as
everyone
knows
pollution
is.
we
feel
a
responsibility
to
end
pollution.
that’s
the
responsibility
of
every
citizen.
but
we
also
feel
that
if
the
abatement
of
pollution
is
a
valid
premise
in
michigan,
it’s
also
a
valid
premise
in
ohio,
in
wisconsin
and
illinois
and
what
have
you.
we
are
willing
to
put
the
equipment
on
the
vessels,
we
are
not
asking
this
court
to
act
as
a
super
legislature
and
decide
what
the
pollution
bill
rights
is
or
should
not
be.
what
we
feel
as
a
basic
concept
that
once
we
installed
pollution
equipment
aboard
the
vessel,
whatever
that
equipment
should
be.
we
should
be
able
to
use
it
wherever
we
go.
we
have
a
federal
license
which
authorizes
to
trade
on
the
northern
and
northeastern
frontier.
having
that
federal
license,
we
should
then
be
able
to
use
that
pollution
device
in
any
port,
any
waters
that
we
go
into.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
first
of
all,
i
think
michigan
has
exceeded
the
police
power.
i
think
that
michigan
statute
goes
beyond
the
police
power
because
it
has
extra
territorial
effect.
secondly,
i
think
the
uniform
maritime
law
play
the
most
important
point
in
this
whole
case
requires
that
this
be
treated
as
a
matter
of
uniformity
and
not
a
matter
of
individual
state
action.
finally,
not
finally
but
we
do
have
a
commerce
clause
involved
here.
there
are
numerous
cases
which
hold
that
where
a
particular
function
in
commerce
requires
national
uniformity,
even
in
the
absence
of
a
federal
statute
then
the
states
have
no
authority
to
act
because
it
has
to
be
treated
uniformly.
finally,
we
do
have
a
question
of
preemption
under
the
federal
water
quality
act
of
1970.
we
also
feel
very
strong
about
that
particular
issue
that
this
field
has
been
completely
preempted
by
the
federal
government.
now,
you
take
a
look
at
the
act,
that
is
the
federal
act
and
congress
came
out
with
a
comprehensive
scheme
of
pollution
control.
it
gave
the
epa
the
authority
to
promulgate
standards
and
figure
out
just
what
type
of
level
of
treatment
you
have
to
have
aboard
these
vessels
and
this
is
a
nationwide
standard.
then
it
gave
the
coastguard
the
authority
to
go
ahead
and
promulgate
rules
and
regulations
covering
the
design
of
that
particular
equipment.
and
this
gets
to
be
very
important
because
that
equipment
has
to
fit
the
vessel
and
it
has
to
comply
with
marine
safety
regulations.
you
have
got
problems
of
stability.
you
have
got
problems
of
the
integrity
as
a
whole.
so
it
has
to
be
all
taken
care
of
by
the
coastguard.
now,
we
advocate
that
this
shows
a
comprehensive
overall
scheme
for
pollution
control.
we
believe
that
preempts
the
states
because
to
let
the
states
go
ahead
here
now.
even
for
a
short
time
completely
frustrates
the
federal
program.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
precisely,
for
this
reason.
if
we
are
to
put
a
holding
tank
in
because
of
michigan’s
law.
presume
we
got
to
pump
that
tank
out
and
if
we
are
in
ohio
and
wisconsin,
we’ve
got
no
legal
remedy,
no
equitable
remedy
while
we
can
compel
anybody
to
put
on
pump-out
station
and
get
rid
of
that
stuff.
so
--
mr.
scott
h.
elder
no,
it
isn’t.
no,
if
we
had
overall
federal
regulations,
then
we
can
put
the
equipment
in
and
we
would
have
some
leverage
somewhere
and
i
assume
that
when
these
federal
regulations
do
go
in,
that
the
epa
is
going
to
have
some
authority
to
control
short
stages
if
the
solution
is
pump-out.
but
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
federal
act,
you
will
see
that
it
provides
for
an
effluent
standard,
meaning
that
there
is
a
certain
overboard
discharge
to
be
allowed,
this
way
the
ship
can
function.
i
realize
that
there
were
probably
certain
limited,
restricted
areas
where
no
overboard
discharge
will
be
allowed
because
of
in
certain
harbors
and
so
forth
that
type
of
thing.
but
once
you
do
that,
make
that
particular
restriction
and
you
put
your
treatment
device
aboard
the
vessel,
then
when
you
do
have
to
hold,
you
can
hold
the
treated
effluent
not
raw
sewage
and
this
is
what
we
want
to
do.
now,
we
are
not
objecting
to
these
limited
no
discharge
areas.
but
we
say
under
the
federal
act,
you
are
allowed
to
have
an
effluent
go
overboard
out
in
the
lake
and
so
forth.
and
then
if
we
do
have
to
hold
and
if
we
do
have
to
store
then
we
are
to
be
holding
treated
effluent
not
raw
sewage
in
a
great
big
tank.
it
is
the
extra
territorial
effect
of
the
michigan
act
--
mr.
scott
h.
elder
definitely,
very
definitely
but
the
point
i’m
trying
to
make
is
this.
i’m
not
asking
this
court
to
set
as
a
legislature
as
i
indicated
before
and
decide
the
pollution
device.
we
are
saying
basically
this.
it’s
got
to
be
uniform.
we
trade
at
eight
states
and
two
provinces
of
canada
so
let’s
make
this
thing
the
same.
we’ve
got
to
go
out
and
put
something
on
these
vessels.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
that’s
a
very
distinct
possibility.
i
mean,
if
the
states
can
do
something.
well,
they
already
have
done
things
completely
different.
the
wisconsin
statute
is
not
the
same
as
the
michigan
statute.
the
new
york
statute
is
not
the
same
as
the
michigan
statute.
in
fact,
actually
our
vessels
are
exempt
under
the
new
york
statute
because
our
vessels
are
already
subject
to
the
interstate
quarantine
regulations.
we
are
already
prohibited
from
federal
law
from
discharging
and
then
briefing
my
--
out
of
any
specified
intake
crib
on
the
great
lakes.
that
is
a
domestic
water
intake
crib.
now,
if
you
just
leave
one
state
alone,
the
problem
is
you
have
got
to
put
something
on
your
vessel,
it’s
a
machine.
it’s
a
piece
of
equipment
and
then
once
you’ve
done
that,
you
just
can’t
shut
it
off.
you
got
to
be
able
to
use
that
wherever
you
go.
and
you
go
outside
in
michigan,
you
are
to
be
able
to
use
it
in
ohio.
but
now
here
is
another
typical
example
and
i’m
way
off
my
argument
here
but
anyway
let’s
look
at
this.
suppose
you
got
a
ship
going
from
duluth
to
chicago.
now
it
passes
down
the
st.
mary’s
river
and
passes
through
michigan
waters.
but
that
particular
vessel
company
has
no
way
of
compelling
the
fellow
in
duluth
to
pump
in
and
put
in
a
pump-out
station.
there
is
no
way
of
compelling
the
fellow
in
chicago
to
put
in
a
pump-out
station
yet
this
ship
is
supposed
to
have
holding
tank
and
put
all
the
stuff
into
it.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
well,
do
you
think
we
can
convince
pacino
railroad
and
cleveland,
ohio
for
example
to
put
in
a
pump-out
station?
mr.
scott
h.
elder
no.
no,
we
are
not
concerned
about
the
cost.
we
are
not
raising
the
question
of
money.
what
we
are
saying
is,
we’ll
do
it,
you’ll
go
ahead
and
put
the
devices
in
but
once
we
do
we
want
to
be
able
to
use
them
wherever
we
go.
i
don’t
think
that
is
an
unreasonable
device
--
mr.
scott
h.
elder
no.
there
are
no
pump-out
stations
that
i
know
of
existence
for
commercial
vessel.
there
are
pump-out
stations
in
these
little
yard
places
and
so
forth,
where
a
vessel
homes
itself
so
to
speak.
but
our
vessels
don’t.
our
vessels
go
all
over
the
lake.
now,
holding
tanks
may
be
a
good
solution
for
some
vessel
that
comes
in
to
a
particular
dock
every
trip,
trades
in
there
every
one
or
two
days.
this
may
be
the
simple
and
best
arrangement.
but
it’s
the
vessel
that
is
coasting
all
over
the
lakes
and
never
knows
what
state
it
is
going
to
be
into
next
and
this
really
gets
down
to
the
fundamental
concept
of
maritime
law.
now,
this
is
more
than
just
a
commerce
clause.
the
maritime,
uniform
maritime
law
is
based
on
entirely
different
provision
of
the
constitution.
and
if
you
look
at
the
knickerbocker
ice
company
case
and
the
jensen
case,
they
say
that
you
have
got
to
absolutely
have
uniformity
throughout
this
maritime
business
and
there
they
held
two
things.
first
of
all,
that
the
state
of
new
york
could
not
regulate
longshoreman,
that’s
why
we
have
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers
compensation
act.
then
in
knickerbocker
ice,
the
congress
turned
around
and
tried
to
give
the
authority
to
the
states
and
this
court
said
no.
this
is
a
congress
of
delegated
powers,
the
delegation
is
from
the
people
to
the
congress
and
the
congress
cannot
give
it
back
to
the
states.
and
this
is
the
one
area
where
the
states
cannot
interfere.
now,
i
know
that
the
state
of
michigan
said,
well,
the
states
can
regulate
pilotage
and
then
there
is
no
interference
with
the
maritime
law.
but
i
think
that’s
an
interesting
example
because
look
at
what
pilotage
is.
now
first
of
all,
pilotage
is
based
essentially
on
local
knowledge.
when
the
constitution
was
written,
we
had
a
conglomeration
of
13
separate
states
but
at
that
time
each
of
those
states
had
their
own
pilotage
system,
within
their
own
pilotage
waters.
but
what
happens,
pilotage
is
local,
it’s
based
on
local
knowledge
and
it
ends
at
the
state
line.
the
pilot
gets
off
the
boat.
here,
we
put
a
holding
tank
on.
we
just
can’t
throw
it
off
the
side
after
we
get
outside
of
michigan’s
water.
so,
i
think
the
distinction
here
is
between
the
full
train
crew
cases
and
the
cases
regulating
the
length
of
trains.
now,
in
the
full
crew
cases,
the
court
noted,
this
court
that
the
effect
of
the
statute
ends
at
the
state
line
of
the
people.
extra
man
in
the
crew,
whatever
it
is,
gets
off
at
the
state
line.
it
is
simple
enough
to
stop
the
train.
but
now,
when
you
start
regulating
the
length
of
the
trains,
then
there
are
only
two
alternatives.
one,
is
to
break
up
the
train
at
every
border
and
reshuffle
your
cars
but
you
can’t
do
this
until
you
got
a
(inaudible).
the
other
alternative
is
to
comply
with
the
very
minimum
number
of
cars
of
any
state
to
which
you
pass.
and
this
court
specifically
held
and
i
am
talking
about
southern
pacific
company
versus
arizona.
this
court
specifically
held
that
that
gave
the
state
statute
based
on
the
police
power
extra
territorial
jurisdiction
which
the
police
power
cannot
extend.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
well,
i
would
like
to
get
to
that
if
you
don’t
mind,
your
honor.
it’s
true
the
three-judge
court
did
not
rule
on
any
of
these
issues.
they
said
that
they
were
going
to
abstain
that
we
should
go
back
to
the
state
courts.
now,
abstention,
alright.
it’s
pretty
clear
that
where
there
is
a
case
pending,
a
criminal
case
pending
in
the
state
court
that
this
court
feels
an
abstention
is
proper
unless
there
is
bad
faith,
harassment
through
this
particular
state
prosecution.
now
here,
there
is
no
harassment,
we
are
not
to
challenge
the
spirit
of
the
officials
of
michigan.
but
also
there
is
a
fact
that
there
is
no
state
prosecution
pending
at
all.
so
when
the
state
court
goes
back,
or
when
the
federal
court
goes
and
says
go
back
to
state
court,
we
actually
have
no
place
to
go
unless
we
just
sit
up
there
in
michigan
and
wait
for
the
state
to
sue
us.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
no.
michigan
has
got
a
declaratory
judgments
act.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
oh!
no.
we
could
not
use
the
state
declaratory
judgment
act
because
if
there
is
no
controversy
in
federal
court
then
there
is
none
in
state
court.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
right
but
the
michigan
statute
is
based
on
the
same
premise
as
--
mr.
scott
h.
elder
this
is
right.
and
this
is
--
mr.
scott
h.
elder
oh,
very
definitely!
there
is
a
real
case
of
controversy
here
because
we’ve
got
187
vessels
that
we’ve
got
to
do
something
with
those
vessels.
now,
before
we
put
in
this
equipment
and
install
it,
we
disagree
that
michigan
has
the
right
to
require
us
to
put
in
holding
tank.
now,
this
we
feel
is
a
very
real
and
right
controversy,
it
means
that
we’ve
got
to
go
out
and
do
something
if
this
michigan
law
is
valid.
if
it
isn’t
then
we
can
go
the
course
of
the
federal
legislation.
so
there
is
a
real
right
and
ready
controversy
here
and
i
was
quite
interested
in
an
opinion
here.
this
is
a
--
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
white
and
mr.
justice
marshall
in
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
in
this
case
of
perez
versus
ledesma
decided
last
term.
citation
is
39
law
4214.
now,
this
court
said
in
that
particular
case,
that
if
the
state
prosecution
was
first
filed
and
if
it
arrives
an
adequate
form
for
the
adjudication
of
constitution
rights,
the
federal
court
should
not
ordinarily
intervene
when
however
as
here
at
the
time
of
the
federal
hearing
there
is
no
state
prosecution
to
which
the
federal
court
plaintiff
may
be
relegated
for
the
assertion
of
his
constitutional
defenses,
the
primary
reason
for
refusing
intervention
is
absence.
then
it
goes
on
to
say
but
the
basic
principle
that
in
appropriate
circumstances,
federal
courts
will
exercise
equity
power
against
state
officials
to
protect
rights,
secured
and
activities
authorized
by
paramount
federal
law
remains
firmly
embedded
in
our
jurisprudence.
now,
more
importantly
it
goes
on
and
says
this,
citing
terrace
versus
thompson,
they
say
that
talking
about
defendants
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
the
appellants
whatever
they
might
be,
they
are
not
obligated
to
take
the
risk
of
prosecutions,
fines
and
imprisonment
and
loss
of
property
in
order
to
secure
an
adjudication
of
their
rights.
finally,
it
says
this,
in
case
of
this
sort
and
whatever
provision
the
claim
of
unconstitutionality
rest,
the
justification
for
intervention
is
that
individuals
should
be
able
to
exercise
their
constitutional
rights
without
running
the
risks
of
becoming
lawbreakers.
the
justification
applies
the
full
force
where
there
is
a
continuing
life
controversy
and
federal
intervention
is
sought
when
there
is
no
state
prosecution
in
which
the
state
may
be
treated.
in
other
words,
we
don’t
feel
that
we’re
lawbreakers
and
we
don’t
think
that
we
should
have
to
sit
and
wait
for
the
suit
or
the
state
to
sue
us
before
we
can
get
an
adjudication
of
our
constitutional
rights.
but,
i
want
to
answer
this
question.
suppose
the
state
did
sue.
in
this
particular
litigation
you
have
got
19
individual
vessels
companies
as
plaintiffs,
operating
a
total
of
187
ships.
alright,
which
one
of
the
19
is
going
to
be
the
first
guinea
pig?
and
i
really
have
the
nerve
to
go
out
and
try
this
type
of
case,
the
pollution
case
in
a
criminal
proceeding.
take
one
step
further,
each
ship
is
potentially
an
offender
although
the
state
courts
have
no
in
rem
jurisdiction.
but,
then
you
have
got
a
187
potential
offenders.
take
the
total
number
of
ships
in
the
great
lakes
and
the
american
flight,
422.
add
to
those
the
canadian
vessel,
the
foreign
overseas
five
vessels
and
you
have
got
all
these
possible
potential
offenders.
but
what
has
really
happened
here,
actually
you’ve
taken
all
these
suits
and
you
consolidated
here
down
into
one
particular
lawsuit.
now
this
is
the
purpose
of
the
declaratory
judgments
act.
this
is
what
its
form.
actually,
you
save
litigation,
you
got
a
form
that
has
taken
away
the
stigma
of
the
criminal
proceeding
and
we
can
get
right
down
to
the
substance
of
deciding
the
case.
now,
--
mr.
scott
h.
elder
we
do
have
a
case
of
controversy.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
what
is
it?
it’s
a
fact
that
they
are
trying
to
require
us
to
install
these
holding
tanks
under
the
michigan
law.
we
say
that
is
under
constitutional
exercise
of
state
power.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
yes.
we
went
up,
we
had
conferences
with
them.
they
want
to
cooperate.
their
concept
of
cooperation
was,
go
ahead
and
put
in
these
holding
tanks.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
yes.
oh!
very
definitely.
very
definitely.
but
frankly,
we
didn’t
want
to
let
it
get
along
so
far
that
we
had
to
go
in
there
and
be
cited
in
a
criminal
proceeding.
now,
that
we’ve
already
been
accused
to
be
lawbreakers.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
right.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
no.
they
are
in
the
process
of
promulgation
and
they
should
be
out
some
time
but
why
they
are
not
out,
i
don’t
know.
this
federal
act
was
passed
in
april
3,
1970
and
they
still
have
it.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
right.
and
we’re
stuck
to
the
holding
tank
and
we
got
even
less
means
than
of
compelling
some
dock-side
in
order
to
put
in
pump-out
facility
because
he
says
you’re
crazy,
we
got
the
federal
act.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
this
is
true
but
there
is
presently
legislation
pending.
it’s
passed
the
house.
it’s
passed
the
senate.
no,
it
has
passed
the
house.
it’s
passed
to
senate.
it
is
reported
out
at
the
committee
in
the
house
which
says
that
why
you
still
have
this
five
and
two-year
period
that
as
soon
as
you
put
in
a
device
that
is
approved
by
united
states
coast
guard
then
you
are
automatically
deemed
to
be
in
compliance
with
federal
law
and
there
will
be
no
state
control
or
preemption.
so,
you
then
accelerate
to
five
years
by
simply
installing
the
device
once
we
got
the
device.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
right.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
no.
the
five
years
is
not
necessary
for
our
protection.
the
five
years
--
mr.
scott
h.
elder
well,
it
is
not
based,
it
is
not
a
concession.
the
senate
said
that
this
is
the
most
reasonable,
practical
time
based
on
technology
and
reasonableness
that
such
a
program
composing
--
mr.
scott
h.
elder
we
do
have
a
five-year
grace
period
but
that
doesn’t
mean
that
there
is
a
vacuum
there
that
the
states
can
fill.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
we
have
five
years
in
which
to
comply
with
the
federal
but
i
don’t
think
it’s
a
question
of
changing
over
from
state
to
federal
because
i
don’t
think
the
states
have
the
jurisdiction
in
the
first
place.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
on
existing
vessel
it
is
true.
but
i’m
sure
that
once
we
get
the
standard,
we’ll
equip
much
faster
than
the
five
years.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
if
they
pass
a
law
like
that,
your
honor,
we’ll
be
right
back
here
again
in
this
court.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
and
that
is
unlawful
delegation
of
court.
but
now,
the
other
side
of
the
coin
is
i
think
the
federal
government
can
adopt
a
state
regulation.
that
is
cooley
versus
board
of
wardens.
but
there
is
a
--
mr.
scott
h.
elder
no,
i
do
not.
no.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
right.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
it’s
based
primarily
on
admiralty
argument
and
the
commerce
clause.
i
think
even
in
the
absence
of
a
federal
statute.
and
we
won’t
even
need
a
federal
statute
here
for
this
court
to
hold
this
michigan
statute
unconstitutional.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
it’s
is
on
the
admiralty
argument,
it’s
on
the
commerce
clause
argument
and
it’s
on
the
basic
commerce
of
the
police
power.
but
you
just
--
this
first
issue
the
police
power.
you
don’t
really
get
to
any
of
the
other
issues.
if
the
state
statute
exceeds
there
basic
police
power
because
of
this
extra
territorial
effect,
you
don’t
actually
have
to
reach
that
stuff.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
the
heron-schmidt
(ph)
case,
i
think
it
sets
the
outer
limits
of
the
police
power
because
once
that
--
mr.
scott
h.
elder
yes.
this
is
true
but
i
think
that
mr.
justice
stewart
what
you
called
the
inner
court
also
becomes
the
outer
limit
because
once
that
vessel
sailed
away
from
detroit,
that
ordinance
had
no
more
effect.
it
did
not
require
any
equipment
change.
if
fact
we
have
still
got
many,
many
hand
acquired
vessel
going
in
and
out
of
detroit.
it
only
means
that
when
you
are
a
fireman,
you
got
to
work
a
little
harder
to
keep
your
--
mr.
scott
h.
elder
yes,
but
once
that
ship
goes
away,
she
is
free.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
i
don’t
recall.
oh!
wait,
yes
sir
there’s
a
footnote
where
they
said
we
do
not
reach
this
particular
issue
as
to
the
equipment
of
the
vessel.
it
was
just
--
mr.
scott
h.
elder
right.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
yes.
well
i
have
kind
of
lost
my
time
i
guess
--
mr.
scott
h.
elder
all
right,
fine.
now
as
i
indicated
earlier.
well,
i
just
briefly
touch
on
due
process
and
equal
protection.
the
thing
is
on
some
of
the
vessels
right
now,
we
have
these
devices
which
treated
secondary
treatment
--
mr.
scott
h.
elder
fine,
thank
you.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
your
honor
i
will
be
very
brief.
we
certainly
agree
that
the
water
should
be
cleaned
up.
we
are
not
asking
for
a
license
to
pollute.
but
if
pollution
control
is
valid
in
michigan,
it’s
valid
in
every
other
state.
mr.
derengoski
said
it’s
a
problem
of
control
that
these
vessels
are
moving
sources
and
therefore
the
state
can’t
police
them.
who
is
in
a
better
position
to
police
the
pollution
than
the
united
states
coastguard
which
licensed
the
vessels,
inspects
the
vessels,
and
has
the
confident
personnel?
our
whole
purpose
here
is
to
promote
the
pollution
control
on
a
uniform
basis
throughout
the
entire
great
lakes
so
that
our
vessels
can
install
the
equipment,
whatever
it
is.
now
this
court
does
not
have
to
decide
what
the
equipment
is
or
what
standards
are.
but
i
think
this
court
is
to
be
bound
to
decide
on
the
basis
of
the
uniform
maritime
law
that
this
should
be
applicable
throughout
the
entire
great
lakes
so
we
can
go
anywhere
to
any
port.
now,
the
uniform
maritime
law
dictates
that
in
order
to
carry
on
commerce,
these
vessels
have
to
be
free
to
move
from
port
to
port.
i
don’t
think
this
is
a
question
that
was
ever
really
reached
in
the
harman
case.
we
do
have
one
other
element
here
and
that
is
the
boundary
waters
treaty
of
1909
between
united
states
and
canada.
this
in
turn
calls
for
uniform
regulation
and
i
think
as
a
matter
of
international
law,
the
individual
states
such
as
michigan
and
ohio
and
so
forth
are
not
recognized
for
purposes
of
treaties
and
so
forth
as
separate
entities.
they
are
part
of
the
united
states
and
the
boundary
water
treaty
entitles
our
canadian
friends
and
our
own
vessels
to
a
right
to
travel
throughout
the
great
lakes.
now,
--
mr.
scott
h.
elder
yes.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
i
couldn’t
find
any
evidence
in
the
harman
case
where
the
argument
of
the
uniform
maritime
law
has
been
raised.
i
think
that
case
was
decided
pretty
much
on
the
commerce
clause
basis.
it
is
my
own
personal
interpretation
at
a
particular
decision,
and
others
may
disagree.
finally,
one
thing
i
want
to
point
out
here,
as
mr.
justice
marshall
know
it,
we
do
have
all
these
people
living
in
michigan
taking
their
drinking
water
from
the
great
lakes
but
also
the
waste
created
by
those
people
are
going
right
back
into
the
lake
through
the
municipal
plants
which
at
best
have
only
primary
treatment,
and
then
michigan
in
this
brief
on
page
2
the
third
paragraph
says,
after
talking
about
these
vessels
(inaudible)
that
it
says
the
municipal
systems
are
normal
point
of
discharge
and
the
water
quality
for
that
particular
area
be
set
and
governed
accordingly.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
two
things,
first
of
all
they
are
not
saying
the
quality
of
the
water
according
to
what
it
should
be,
they
are
saying
that
according
to
what
a
certain
source
of
pollution
is
an
alarming.
the
second
point
is
that
these
very
same
devices
and
we
have
on
our
vessels,
mainly
the
biogase
system
are
recognized
and
used
in
shopping
centers,
in
small
communities,
the
very
same
device
is
permitted
on
land
in
michigan.
now,
we
say
it’s
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
to
permit
them
to
go
ahead
and
use
them
on
land
and
not
let
us
use
them
on
the
ships
but
really,
we’re
doing
less
harm
than
anybody
because
for
the
most
part
of
your
ships
lay
out
on
the
lake
or
away
from
shore,
away
from
populous
areas
and
we
think
this
is
a
denial
of
the
equal
protection
laws.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
you
take
a
look
at
michigan’s
law
and
to
the
vessels
downtown
to
the
st.
mary’s
river,
the
same
river
is
going
to
be
prohibited
but
how
about
the
vessels
upbound
to
canadian
water.
there
is
no
restriction
whatsoever
in
the
st.
louis
side
by
side
two
boats
passing
through
by
feet
apart.
one
was
prohibited
use.
the
inner
suburbans
load
up
on
the
charts
of
the
rivers
and
there
are
only
the
exhibits
that
are
filed
in
this
case
and
these
vessels
move
back
and
forth
and
these
naturals
have
to
turn
with
whose
water
they
are
in?
mr.
scott
h.
elder
how
long?
you
mean
the
actual
vessels
themselves
or
the
companies
or
what
mr.
scott
h.
elder
oh!
somewhere
back
to
1880,
1889
something
like
that.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
oh!
yes.
many
of
the
vessels
have
installed
these
biogas
systems.
every
ship
has
been
constructed
on
the
great
lakes
since
1950,
has
had
a
sewage
treatment
system
installed
and
we
got
several
new
vessels
under
construction
right
now,
which
will
have
a
treatment
system
but
we
really
don’t
know
what
they
haev.
this
base
port
and
here
the
ships
are
under
construction,
and
they
don’t
know
what
kind
of
advice
they
are
getting.
now,
through
the
michigan
water
--
i
see
my
light.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
yes.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
i
suppose
our
plea
here
is
really
quite
simple
when
you
boil
everything
down.
what’s
involved
is
basically
a
fleet
of
vessels
navigating
the
great
lakes.
these
vessels
trade
throughout
some
eight
separate
states
in
interstate
and
foreign
commerce
and
two
provinces
of
canada.
now
we’re
involved
with
a
somewhat
emotional
issue
as
everyone
knows
pollution
is.
we
feel
a
responsibility
to
end
pollution.
that’s
the
responsibility
of
every
citizen.
but
we
also
feel
that
if
the
abatement
of
pollution
is
a
valid
premise
in
michigan,
it’s
also
a
valid
premise
in
ohio,
in
wisconsin
and
illinois
and
what
have
you.
we
are
willing
to
put
the
equipment
on
the
vessels,
we
are
not
asking
this
court
to
act
as
a
super
legislature
and
decide
what
the
pollution
bill
rights
is
or
should
not
be.
what
we
feel
as
a
basic
concept
that
once
we
installed
pollution
equipment
aboard
the
vessel,
whatever
that
equipment
should
be.
we
should
be
able
to
use
it
wherever
we
go.
we
have
a
federal
license
which
authorizes
to
trade
on
the
northern
and
northeastern
frontier.
having
that
federal
license,
we
should
then
be
able
to
use
that
pollution
device
in
any
port,
any
waters
that
we
go
into.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
first
of
all,
i
think
michigan
has
exceeded
the
police
power.
i
think
that
michigan
statute
goes
beyond
the
police
power
because
it
has
extra
territorial
effect.
secondly,
i
think
the
uniform
maritime
law
play
the
most
important
point
in
this
whole
case
requires
that
this
be
treated
as
a
matter
of
uniformity
and
not
a
matter
of
individual
state
action.
finally,
not
finally
but
we
do
have
a
commerce
clause
involved
here.
there
are
numerous
cases
which
hold
that
where
a
particular
function
in
commerce
requires
national
uniformity,
even
in
the
absence
of
a
federal
statute
then
the
states
have
no
authority
to
act
because
it
has
to
be
treated
uniformly.
finally,
we
do
have
a
question
of
preemption
under
the
federal
water
quality
act
of
1970.
we
also
feel
very
strong
about
that
particular
issue
that
this
field
has
been
completely
preempted
by
the
federal
government.
now,
you
take
a
look
at
the
act,
that
is
the
federal
act
and
congress
came
out
with
a
comprehensive
scheme
of
pollution
control.
it
gave
the
epa
the
authority
to
promulgate
standards
and
figure
out
just
what
type
of
level
of
treatment
you
have
to
have
aboard
these
vessels
and
this
is
a
nationwide
standard.
then
it
gave
the
coastguard
the
authority
to
go
ahead
and
promulgate
rules
and
regulations
covering
the
design
of
that
particular
equipment.
and
this
gets
to
be
very
important
because
that
equipment
has
to
fit
the
vessel
and
it
has
to
comply
with
marine
safety
regulations.
you
have
got
problems
of
stability.
you
have
got
problems
of
the
integrity
as
a
whole.
so
it
has
to
be
all
taken
care
of
by
the
coastguard.
now,
we
advocate
that
this
shows
a
comprehensive
overall
scheme
for
pollution
control.
we
believe
that
preempts
the
states
because
to
let
the
states
go
ahead
here
now.
even
for
a
short
time
completely
frustrates
the
federal
program.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
precisely,
for
this
reason.
if
we
are
to
put
a
holding
tank
in
because
of
michigan’s
law.
presume
we
got
to
pump
that
tank
out
and
if
we
are
in
ohio
and
wisconsin,
we’ve
got
no
legal
remedy,
no
equitable
remedy
while
we
can
compel
anybody
to
put
on
pump-out
station
and
get
rid
of
that
stuff.
so
--
mr.
scott
h.
elder
no,
it
isn’t.
no,
if
we
had
overall
federal
regulations,
then
we
can
put
the
equipment
in
and
we
would
have
some
leverage
somewhere
and
i
assume
that
when
these
federal
regulations
do
go
in,
that
the
epa
is
going
to
have
some
authority
to
control
short
stages
if
the
solution
is
pump-out.
but
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
federal
act,
you
will
see
that
it
provides
for
an
effluent
standard,
meaning
that
there
is
a
certain
overboard
discharge
to
be
allowed,
this
way
the
ship
can
function.
i
realize
that
there
were
probably
certain
limited,
restricted
areas
where
no
overboard
discharge
will
be
allowed
because
of
in
certain
harbors
and
so
forth
that
type
of
thing.
but
once
you
do
that,
make
that
particular
restriction
and
you
put
your
treatment
device
aboard
the
vessel,
then
when
you
do
have
to
hold,
you
can
hold
the
treated
effluent
not
raw
sewage
and
this
is
what
we
want
to
do.
now,
we
are
not
objecting
to
these
limited
no
discharge
areas.
but
we
say
under
the
federal
act,
you
are
allowed
to
have
an
effluent
go
overboard
out
in
the
lake
and
so
forth.
and
then
if
we
do
have
to
hold
and
if
we
do
have
to
store
then
we
are
to
be
holding
treated
effluent
not
raw
sewage
in
a
great
big
tank.
it
is
the
extra
territorial
effect
of
the
michigan
act
--
mr.
scott
h.
elder
definitely,
very
definitely
but
the
point
i’m
trying
to
make
is
this.
i’m
not
asking
this
court
to
set
as
a
legislature
as
i
indicated
before
and
decide
the
pollution
device.
we
are
saying
basically
this.
it’s
got
to
be
uniform.
we
trade
at
eight
states
and
two
provinces
of
canada
so
let’s
make
this
thing
the
same.
we’ve
got
to
go
out
and
put
something
on
these
vessels.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
that’s
a
very
distinct
possibility.
i
mean,
if
the
states
can
do
something.
well,
they
already
have
done
things
completely
different.
the
wisconsin
statute
is
not
the
same
as
the
michigan
statute.
the
new
york
statute
is
not
the
same
as
the
michigan
statute.
in
fact,
actually
our
vessels
are
exempt
under
the
new
york
statute
because
our
vessels
are
already
subject
to
the
interstate
quarantine
regulations.
we
are
already
prohibited
from
federal
law
from
discharging
and
then
briefing
my
--
out
of
any
specified
intake
crib
on
the
great
lakes.
that
is
a
domestic
water
intake
crib.
now,
if
you
just
leave
one
state
alone,
the
problem
is
you
have
got
to
put
something
on
your
vessel,
it’s
a
machine.
it’s
a
piece
of
equipment
and
then
once
you’ve
done
that,
you
just
can’t
shut
it
off.
you
got
to
be
able
to
use
that
wherever
you
go.
and
you
go
outside
in
michigan,
you
are
to
be
able
to
use
it
in
ohio.
but
now
here
is
another
typical
example
and
i’m
way
off
my
argument
here
but
anyway
let’s
look
at
this.
suppose
you
got
a
ship
going
from
duluth
to
chicago.
now
it
passes
down
the
st.
mary’s
river
and
passes
through
michigan
waters.
but
that
particular
vessel
company
has
no
way
of
compelling
the
fellow
in
duluth
to
pump
in
and
put
in
a
pump-out
station.
there
is
no
way
of
compelling
the
fellow
in
chicago
to
put
in
a
pump-out
station
yet
this
ship
is
supposed
to
have
holding
tank
and
put
all
the
stuff
into
it.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
well,
do
you
think
we
can
convince
pacino
railroad
and
cleveland,
ohio
for
example
to
put
in
a
pump-out
station?
mr.
scott
h.
elder
no.
no,
we
are
not
concerned
about
the
cost.
we
are
not
raising
the
question
of
money.
what
we
are
saying
is,
we’ll
do
it,
you’ll
go
ahead
and
put
the
devices
in
but
once
we
do
we
want
to
be
able
to
use
them
wherever
we
go.
i
don’t
think
that
is
an
unreasonable
device
--
mr.
scott
h.
elder
no.
there
are
no
pump-out
stations
that
i
know
of
existence
for
commercial
vessel.
there
are
pump-out
stations
in
these
little
yard
places
and
so
forth,
where
a
vessel
homes
itself
so
to
speak.
but
our
vessels
don’t.
our
vessels
go
all
over
the
lake.
now,
holding
tanks
may
be
a
good
solution
for
some
vessel
that
comes
in
to
a
particular
dock
every
trip,
trades
in
there
every
one
or
two
days.
this
may
be
the
simple
and
best
arrangement.
but
it’s
the
vessel
that
is
coasting
all
over
the
lakes
and
never
knows
what
state
it
is
going
to
be
into
next
and
this
really
gets
down
to
the
fundamental
concept
of
maritime
law.
now,
this
is
more
than
just
a
commerce
clause.
the
maritime,
uniform
maritime
law
is
based
on
entirely
different
provision
of
the
constitution.
and
if
you
look
at
the
knickerbocker
ice
company
case
and
the
jensen
case,
they
say
that
you
have
got
to
absolutely
have
uniformity
throughout
this
maritime
business
and
there
they
held
two
things.
first
of
all,
that
the
state
of
new
york
could
not
regulate
longshoreman,
that’s
why
we
have
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers
compensation
act.
then
in
knickerbocker
ice,
the
congress
turned
around
and
tried
to
give
the
authority
to
the
states
and
this
court
said
no.
this
is
a
congress
of
delegated
powers,
the
delegation
is
from
the
people
to
the
congress
and
the
congress
cannot
give
it
back
to
the
states.
and
this
is
the
one
area
where
the
states
cannot
interfere.
now,
i
know
that
the
state
of
michigan
said,
well,
the
states
can
regulate
pilotage
and
then
there
is
no
interference
with
the
maritime
law.
but
i
think
that’s
an
interesting
example
because
look
at
what
pilotage
is.
now
first
of
all,
pilotage
is
based
essentially
on
local
knowledge.
when
the
constitution
was
written,
we
had
a
conglomeration
of
13
separate
states
but
at
that
time
each
of
those
states
had
their
own
pilotage
system,
within
their
own
pilotage
waters.
but
what
happens,
pilotage
is
local,
it’s
based
on
local
knowledge
and
it
ends
at
the
state
line.
the
pilot
gets
off
the
boat.
here,
we
put
a
holding
tank
on.
we
just
can’t
throw
it
off
the
side
after
we
get
outside
of
michigan’s
water.
so,
i
think
the
distinction
here
is
between
the
full
train
crew
cases
and
the
cases
regulating
the
length
of
trains.
now,
in
the
full
crew
cases,
the
court
noted,
this
court
that
the
effect
of
the
statute
ends
at
the
state
line
of
the
people.
extra
man
in
the
crew,
whatever
it
is,
gets
off
at
the
state
line.
it
is
simple
enough
to
stop
the
train.
but
now,
when
you
start
regulating
the
length
of
the
trains,
then
there
are
only
two
alternatives.
one,
is
to
break
up
the
train
at
every
border
and
reshuffle
your
cars
but
you
can’t
do
this
until
you
got
a
(inaudible).
the
other
alternative
is
to
comply
with
the
very
minimum
number
of
cars
of
any
state
to
which
you
pass.
and
this
court
specifically
held
and
i
am
talking
about
southern
pacific
company
versus
arizona.
this
court
specifically
held
that
that
gave
the
state
statute
based
on
the
police
power
extra
territorial
jurisdiction
which
the
police
power
cannot
extend.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
well,
i
would
like
to
get
to
that
if
you
don’t
mind,
your
honor.
it’s
true
the
three-judge
court
did
not
rule
on
any
of
these
issues.
they
said
that
they
were
going
to
abstain
that
we
should
go
back
to
the
state
courts.
now,
abstention,
alright.
it’s
pretty
clear
that
where
there
is
a
case
pending,
a
criminal
case
pending
in
the
state
court
that
this
court
feels
an
abstention
is
proper
unless
there
is
bad
faith,
harassment
through
this
particular
state
prosecution.
now
here,
there
is
no
harassment,
we
are
not
to
challenge
the
spirit
of
the
officials
of
michigan.
but
also
there
is
a
fact
that
there
is
no
state
prosecution
pending
at
all.
so
when
the
state
court
goes
back,
or
when
the
federal
court
goes
and
says
go
back
to
state
court,
we
actually
have
no
place
to
go
unless
we
just
sit
up
there
in
michigan
and
wait
for
the
state
to
sue
us.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
no.
michigan
has
got
a
declaratory
judgments
act.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
oh!
no.
we
could
not
use
the
state
declaratory
judgment
act
because
if
there
is
no
controversy
in
federal
court
then
there
is
none
in
state
court.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
right
but
the
michigan
statute
is
based
on
the
same
premise
as
--
mr.
scott
h.
elder
this
is
right.
and
this
is
--
mr.
scott
h.
elder
oh,
very
definitely!
there
is
a
real
case
of
controversy
here
because
we’ve
got
187
vessels
that
we’ve
got
to
do
something
with
those
vessels.
now,
before
we
put
in
this
equipment
and
install
it,
we
disagree
that
michigan
has
the
right
to
require
us
to
put
in
holding
tank.
now,
this
we
feel
is
a
very
real
and
right
controversy,
it
means
that
we’ve
got
to
go
out
and
do
something
if
this
michigan
law
is
valid.
if
it
isn’t
then
we
can
go
the
course
of
the
federal
legislation.
so
there
is
a
real
right
and
ready
controversy
here
and
i
was
quite
interested
in
an
opinion
here.
this
is
a
--
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
white
and
mr.
justice
marshall
in
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
in
this
case
of
perez
versus
ledesma
decided
last
term.
citation
is
39
law
4214.
now,
this
court
said
in
that
particular
case,
that
if
the
state
prosecution
was
first
filed
and
if
it
arrives
an
adequate
form
for
the
adjudication
of
constitution
rights,
the
federal
court
should
not
ordinarily
intervene
when
however
as
here
at
the
time
of
the
federal
hearing
there
is
no
state
prosecution
to
which
the
federal
court
plaintiff
may
be
relegated
for
the
assertion
of
his
constitutional
defenses,
the
primary
reason
for
refusing
intervention
is
absence.
then
it
goes
on
to
say
but
the
basic
principle
that
in
appropriate
circumstances,
federal
courts
will
exercise
equity
power
against
state
officials
to
protect
rights,
secured
and
activities
authorized
by
paramount
federal
law
remains
firmly
embedded
in
our
jurisprudence.
now,
more
importantly
it
goes
on
and
says
this,
citing
terrace
versus
thompson,
they
say
that
talking
about
defendants
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
the
appellants
whatever
they
might
be,
they
are
not
obligated
to
take
the
risk
of
prosecutions,
fines
and
imprisonment
and
loss
of
property
in
order
to
secure
an
adjudication
of
their
rights.
finally,
it
says
this,
in
case
of
this
sort
and
whatever
provision
the
claim
of
unconstitutionality
rest,
the
justification
for
intervention
is
that
individuals
should
be
able
to
exercise
their
constitutional
rights
without
running
the
risks
of
becoming
lawbreakers.
the
justification
applies
the
full
force
where
there
is
a
continuing
life
controversy
and
federal
intervention
is
sought
when
there
is
no
state
prosecution
in
which
the
state
may
be
treated.
in
other
words,
we
don’t
feel
that
we’re
lawbreakers
and
we
don’t
think
that
we
should
have
to
sit
and
wait
for
the
suit
or
the
state
to
sue
us
before
we
can
get
an
adjudication
of
our
constitutional
rights.
but,
i
want
to
answer
this
question.
suppose
the
state
did
sue.
in
this
particular
litigation
you
have
got
19
individual
vessels
companies
as
plaintiffs,
operating
a
total
of
187
ships.
alright,
which
one
of
the
19
is
going
to
be
the
first
guinea
pig?
and
i
really
have
the
nerve
to
go
out
and
try
this
type
of
case,
the
pollution
case
in
a
criminal
proceeding.
take
one
step
further,
each
ship
is
potentially
an
offender
although
the
state
courts
have
no
in
rem
jurisdiction.
but,
then
you
have
got
a
187
potential
offenders.
take
the
total
number
of
ships
in
the
great
lakes
and
the
american
flight,
422.
add
to
those
the
canadian
vessel,
the
foreign
overseas
five
vessels
and
you
have
got
all
these
possible
potential
offenders.
but
what
has
really
happened
here,
actually
you’ve
taken
all
these
suits
and
you
consolidated
here
down
into
one
particular
lawsuit.
now
this
is
the
purpose
of
the
declaratory
judgments
act.
this
is
what
its
form.
actually,
you
save
litigation,
you
got
a
form
that
has
taken
away
the
stigma
of
the
criminal
proceeding
and
we
can
get
right
down
to
the
substance
of
deciding
the
case.
now,
--
mr.
scott
h.
elder
we
do
have
a
case
of
controversy.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
what
is
it?
it’s
a
fact
that
they
are
trying
to
require
us
to
install
these
holding
tanks
under
the
michigan
law.
we
say
that
is
under
constitutional
exercise
of
state
power.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
yes.
we
went
up,
we
had
conferences
with
them.
they
want
to
cooperate.
their
concept
of
cooperation
was,
go
ahead
and
put
in
these
holding
tanks.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
yes.
oh!
very
definitely.
very
definitely.
but
frankly,
we
didn’t
want
to
let
it
get
along
so
far
that
we
had
to
go
in
there
and
be
cited
in
a
criminal
proceeding.
now,
that
we’ve
already
been
accused
to
be
lawbreakers.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
right.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
no.
they
are
in
the
process
of
promulgation
and
they
should
be
out
some
time
but
why
they
are
not
out,
i
don’t
know.
this
federal
act
was
passed
in
april
3,
1970
and
they
still
have
it.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
right.
and
we’re
stuck
to
the
holding
tank
and
we
got
even
less
means
than
of
compelling
some
dock-side
in
order
to
put
in
pump-out
facility
because
he
says
you’re
crazy,
we
got
the
federal
act.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
this
is
true
but
there
is
presently
legislation
pending.
it’s
passed
the
house.
it’s
passed
the
senate.
no,
it
has
passed
the
house.
it’s
passed
to
senate.
it
is
reported
out
at
the
committee
in
the
house
which
says
that
why
you
still
have
this
five
and
two-year
period
that
as
soon
as
you
put
in
a
device
that
is
approved
by
united
states
coast
guard
then
you
are
automatically
deemed
to
be
in
compliance
with
federal
law
and
there
will
be
no
state
control
or
preemption.
so,
you
then
accelerate
to
five
years
by
simply
installing
the
device
once
we
got
the
device.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
right.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
no.
the
five
years
is
not
necessary
for
our
protection.
the
five
years
--
mr.
scott
h.
elder
well,
it
is
not
based,
it
is
not
a
concession.
the
senate
said
that
this
is
the
most
reasonable,
practical
time
based
on
technology
and
reasonableness
that
such
a
program
composing
--
mr.
scott
h.
elder
we
do
have
a
five-year
grace
period
but
that
doesn’t
mean
that
there
is
a
vacuum
there
that
the
states
can
fill.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
we
have
five
years
in
which
to
comply
with
the
federal
but
i
don’t
think
it’s
a
question
of
changing
over
from
state
to
federal
because
i
don’t
think
the
states
have
the
jurisdiction
in
the
first
place.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
on
existing
vessel
it
is
true.
but
i’m
sure
that
once
we
get
the
standard,
we’ll
equip
much
faster
than
the
five
years.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
if
they
pass
a
law
like
that,
your
honor,
we’ll
be
right
back
here
again
in
this
court.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
and
that
is
unlawful
delegation
of
court.
but
now,
the
other
side
of
the
coin
is
i
think
the
federal
government
can
adopt
a
state
regulation.
that
is
cooley
versus
board
of
wardens.
but
there
is
a
--
mr.
scott
h.
elder
no,
i
do
not.
no.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
right.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
it’s
based
primarily
on
admiralty
argument
and
the
commerce
clause.
i
think
even
in
the
absence
of
a
federal
statute.
and
we
won’t
even
need
a
federal
statute
here
for
this
court
to
hold
this
michigan
statute
unconstitutional.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
it’s
is
on
the
admiralty
argument,
it’s
on
the
commerce
clause
argument
and
it’s
on
the
basic
commerce
of
the
police
power.
but
you
just
--
this
first
issue
the
police
power.
you
don’t
really
get
to
any
of
the
other
issues.
if
the
state
statute
exceeds
there
basic
police
power
because
of
this
extra
territorial
effect,
you
don’t
actually
have
to
reach
that
stuff.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
the
heron-schmidt
(ph)
case,
i
think
it
sets
the
outer
limits
of
the
police
power
because
once
that
--
mr.
scott
h.
elder
yes.
this
is
true
but
i
think
that
mr.
justice
stewart
what
you
called
the
inner
court
also
becomes
the
outer
limit
because
once
that
vessel
sailed
away
from
detroit,
that
ordinance
had
no
more
effect.
it
did
not
require
any
equipment
change.
if
fact
we
have
still
got
many,
many
hand
acquired
vessel
going
in
and
out
of
detroit.
it
only
means
that
when
you
are
a
fireman,
you
got
to
work
a
little
harder
to
keep
your
--
mr.
scott
h.
elder
yes,
but
once
that
ship
goes
away,
she
is
free.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
i
don’t
recall.
oh!
wait,
yes
sir
there’s
a
footnote
where
they
said
we
do
not
reach
this
particular
issue
as
to
the
equipment
of
the
vessel.
it
was
just
--
mr.
scott
h.
elder
right.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
yes.
well
i
have
kind
of
lost
my
time
i
guess
--
mr.
scott
h.
elder
all
right,
fine.
now
as
i
indicated
earlier.
well,
i
just
briefly
touch
on
due
process
and
equal
protection.
the
thing
is
on
some
of
the
vessels
right
now,
we
have
these
devices
which
treated
secondary
treatment
--
mr.
scott
h.
elder
fine,
thank
you.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
your
honor
i
will
be
very
brief.
we
certainly
agree
that
the
water
should
be
cleaned
up.
we
are
not
asking
for
a
license
to
pollute.
but
if
pollution
control
is
valid
in
michigan,
it’s
valid
in
every
other
state.
mr.
derengoski
said
it’s
a
problem
of
control
that
these
vessels
are
moving
sources
and
therefore
the
state
can’t
police
them.
who
is
in
a
better
position
to
police
the
pollution
than
the
united
states
coastguard
which
licensed
the
vessels,
inspects
the
vessels,
and
has
the
confident
personnel?
our
whole
purpose
here
is
to
promote
the
pollution
control
on
a
uniform
basis
throughout
the
entire
great
lakes
so
that
our
vessels
can
install
the
equipment,
whatever
it
is.
now
this
court
does
not
have
to
decide
what
the
equipment
is
or
what
standards
are.
but
i
think
this
court
is
to
be
bound
to
decide
on
the
basis
of
the
uniform
maritime
law
that
this
should
be
applicable
throughout
the
entire
great
lakes
so
we
can
go
anywhere
to
any
port.
now,
the
uniform
maritime
law
dictates
that
in
order
to
carry
on
commerce,
these
vessels
have
to
be
free
to
move
from
port
to
port.
i
don’t
think
this
is
a
question
that
was
ever
really
reached
in
the
harman
case.
we
do
have
one
other
element
here
and
that
is
the
boundary
waters
treaty
of
1909
between
united
states
and
canada.
this
in
turn
calls
for
uniform
regulation
and
i
think
as
a
matter
of
international
law,
the
individual
states
such
as
michigan
and
ohio
and
so
forth
are
not
recognized
for
purposes
of
treaties
and
so
forth
as
separate
entities.
they
are
part
of
the
united
states
and
the
boundary
water
treaty
entitles
our
canadian
friends
and
our
own
vessels
to
a
right
to
travel
throughout
the
great
lakes.
now,
--
mr.
scott
h.
elder
yes.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
i
couldn’t
find
any
evidence
in
the
harman
case
where
the
argument
of
the
uniform
maritime
law
has
been
raised.
i
think
that
case
was
decided
pretty
much
on
the
commerce
clause
basis.
it
is
my
own
personal
interpretation
at
a
particular
decision,
and
others
may
disagree.
finally,
one
thing
i
want
to
point
out
here,
as
mr.
justice
marshall
know
it,
we
do
have
all
these
people
living
in
michigan
taking
their
drinking
water
from
the
great
lakes
but
also
the
waste
created
by
those
people
are
going
right
back
into
the
lake
through
the
municipal
plants
which
at
best
have
only
primary
treatment,
and
then
michigan
in
this
brief
on
page
2
the
third
paragraph
says,
after
talking
about
these
vessels
(inaudible)
that
it
says
the
municipal
systems
are
normal
point
of
discharge
and
the
water
quality
for
that
particular
area
be
set
and
governed
accordingly.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
two
things,
first
of
all
they
are
not
saying
the
quality
of
the
water
according
to
what
it
should
be,
they
are
saying
that
according
to
what
a
certain
source
of
pollution
is
an
alarming.
the
second
point
is
that
these
very
same
devices
and
we
have
on
our
vessels,
mainly
the
biogase
system
are
recognized
and
used
in
shopping
centers,
in
small
communities,
the
very
same
device
is
permitted
on
land
in
michigan.
now,
we
say
it’s
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
to
permit
them
to
go
ahead
and
use
them
on
land
and
not
let
us
use
them
on
the
ships
but
really,
we’re
doing
less
harm
than
anybody
because
for
the
most
part
of
your
ships
lay
out
on
the
lake
or
away
from
shore,
away
from
populous
areas
and
we
think
this
is
a
denial
of
the
equal
protection
laws.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
you
take
a
look
at
michigan’s
law
and
to
the
vessels
downtown
to
the
st.
mary’s
river,
the
same
river
is
going
to
be
prohibited
but
how
about
the
vessels
upbound
to
canadian
water.
there
is
no
restriction
whatsoever
in
the
st.
louis
side
by
side
two
boats
passing
through
by
feet
apart.
one
was
prohibited
use.
the
inner
suburbans
load
up
on
the
charts
of
the
rivers
and
there
are
only
the
exhibits
that
are
filed
in
this
case
and
these
vessels
move
back
and
forth
and
these
naturals
have
to
turn
with
whose
water
they
are
in?
mr.
scott
h.
elder
how
long?
you
mean
the
actual
vessels
themselves
or
the
companies
or
what
mr.
scott
h.
elder
oh!
somewhere
back
to
1880,
1889
something
like
that.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
oh!
yes.
many
of
the
vessels
have
installed
these
biogas
systems.
every
ship
has
been
constructed
on
the
great
lakes
since
1950,
has
had
a
sewage
treatment
system
installed
and
we
got
several
new
vessels
under
construction
right
now,
which
will
have
a
treatment
system
but
we
really
don’t
know
what
they
haev.
this
base
port
and
here
the
ships
are
under
construction,
and
they
don’t
know
what
kind
of
advice
they
are
getting.
now,
through
the
michigan
water
--
i
see
my
light.
mr.
scott
h.
elder
yes.
