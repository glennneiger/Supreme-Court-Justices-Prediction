mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
water
resources
act
of
1966
and
the
water
quality
act
of
1970
prescribed
to
be
the
national
policy
that
the
environment
of
this
country
including
its
waters
be
cleaned
up.
in
each
of
these
statutes,
they
have
placed
upon
the
states
the
primary
responsibility
for
implementing
that
policy.
in
view
in
michigan
in
the
case
of
the
sewage
disposal
from
vessels
has
enacted
a
statute
which
is
the
ultimate
in
that
area
mainly
complete
retention
of
sewage
and
dispose
off
the
(inaudible)
and
therefore,
i
am
somewhat
surprised
at
being
here.
in
response
to
the
question
of
mr.
justice
white
at
the
conclusion
of
yesterday’s
session,
i
say
that
the
only
controversy
now
existing
between
the
parties
in
this
cause
is
the
question
of
how
this
should
be
accomplished.
michigan
says
by
complete
retention
and
they
say,
no.
in
addition,
they
attacked
the
statute
on
numerous
constitutional
grounds.
that
is
the
only
controversy.
there
is
no
prosecution
pending
or
eminent
at
this
time.
we
realized
sir
the
futility
of
a
prosecution
at
this
time
with
inadequate
shore
size
pump-out
facilities.
but
we
are
working
on
that
and
we
are
making
headway
until
this
litigation
was
commenced.
we
realized
they
must
have
facilities
to
pump-out
before
the
law
could
be
properly
applied.
now,
i
might
go
a
little
further
and
say
insofar
as
the
controversy
goes,
there
is
a
controversy
between
the
parties
in
this
cause
as
to
what
constitutes
pollution
or
clean
water.
the
appellants
in
this
cause
evidently
say
that
by
the
use
of
certain
devices
on
their
vessels
by
which
they
can
pull
--
if
i
may
use
the
contradictory
term
clean
soil
into
wide
waters.
they
are
aiding
and
abetting
in
fulfilling
the
federal
requirements
that
pollution
of
our
waters
be
controlled.
michigan
says
otherwise,
we
say
in
effect
“thou
shalt
not
dump.”
now,
putting
in
its
proper
perspective,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
devices
which
these
plaintiffs
claim
will
range
in
their
waste
less
obnoxious
to
the
waters
of
the
state
of
michigan.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
record
shows
that
at
the
187
vessels
possessed
by
these
appellants,
only
some
50
have
a
device
of
any
kind.
in
other
words,
about
15%.
in
other
words,
you
have
about
85%
of
your
vessels
pouring
raw,
untreated
sewage
into
the
waters
of
the
great
lakes.
projecting
that
to
the
entire
great
lakes
fleet
of
some
422
vessels.
the
extent
of
their
deprivation
is
horrendous
to
be
hold.
it
is
a
special
problem
in
michigan.
we
are
surrounded
on
three
sides
as
the
court
knows
by
waters
of
the
great
lakes
with
the
longest
shoreline
in
this
country
except
for
alaska.
the
bulk
of
michigan
people
take
their
drinking
water
from
the
great
lakes.
for
example,
in
detroit
and
its
suburbs,
3,750,000
people,
that
was
the
figure
in
1970,
take
their
drinking
water
from
the
detroit
river
which
is
one
of
the
bodies
of
water
involved
in
this
litigation.
so
this
seriousness
of
the
situation
and
the
necessity
for
a
total
retention
requirement
by
michigan
is
also
obvious.
may
it
please
the
court,
probably
for
the
first
time
in
my
professional
career
i
was
pleased
to
receive
a
reply
brief
for
in
this
brief
filed
by
the
appellants,
i
believe
the
verity
of
our
cause
is
proved.
they
say
and
for
the
first
time
they
recognized
that
michigan
has
a
problem
and
they
say
that
the
problem
is
solved
by
the
quarantine
regulations
issued
by
the
public
health
service
under
the
guidance
of
the
surgeon
general
in
1960.
now,
i
do
not
intend
to
be
snide
or
patched
in
this
remark.
brother
elder
has
conducted
himself
in
accordance
with
the
highest
standards
of
the
profession
during
the
conduct
of
this
litigation.
by
the
at
least
1960
regulation
of
the
surgeon
general
was
of
such
significance
in
this
cause.
why
was
it
not
before
the
district
court
in
the
1971
trial
of
this
case?
i
read
the
surgeon
general’s
requirements
your
honor
insofar
as
at
least
michigan
is
concerned
are
quite
meaningless
numbered
paragraph
3
for
example,
exempts
from
the
requirements
vessels
which
have
sewage
disposal
devices.
i
have
just
given
you
the
figures
showing
how
few
of
these
vessels
have
any
device
whatsoever.
further
in
number
paragraph
1
of
the
regulations,
it
says
that
all
vessels
moored
shall
not
discharge
sewage,
etcetera
into
the
waters
if
there
are
dockside
facilities
available
for
the
disposition
of
same.
well,
that
is
one
of
the
complaints
of
appellants
in
this
cause
that
there
are
no
pump-out
facilities
anywhere.
although
under
the
surgeon
general’s
regulations,
these
people
just
continue
to
dump
and
the
basic
requirement
of
the
surgeon
general
requirement
is
that
there
shall
be
no
disposal
of
sewage
within
three
miles
of
a
public
water
intake.
well,
your
honor,
that
presupposes
that
the
way
we
use
the
water,
the
current
and
even
the
sun
are
just
perfect
and
that
the
effluent
dumped
will
remain
in
one
spot.
those
living
at
the
midwest
would
know
that
such
a
day
has
never
occurred.
and
insofar
as
three-mile
pump-out
prohibition
is
concerned
at
a
three
mile
radius,
the
detroit
river
river
from
which
i
said
3,750,000
people
take
their
water
supply
is
that
at
its
widest
point
in
mile
and
a
half.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
yes,
sir
we
do.
if
there
are
controversy
of
michigan
waters
--
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
well,
there
is
--
there
is
by
name
boundary
line
drawn
by
commission
years
ago
between
the
states
above
wisconsin
and
michigan
out
about
approximately
the
middle
of
lake
michigan
which
is
known
as
the
boundary
between
michigan
and
wisconsin
and
they
are
referred
to
and
any
federal
statute
refers
to
the
boundary
waters
of
the
state.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
yes,
sir.
now,
i
realized
the
practical
problem.
we
of
course
have
no
jurisdiction
in
wisconsin
waters.
we
don’t
have
sewage
dumped
in
wisconsin
waters
anymore
than
in
ours.
but
the
practical
situation
is
that
jurisdiction
wise
we
may
only
enforce
a
requirement
within
the
perview
of
michigan’s
boundary
waters.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
yes.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
sir,
there
was
a
boundary
commission
between
comprised
of
michigan
and
wisconsin
officials
over
ten
years
ago
wherein
this
boundary
was
drawn.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
ten
or
15
years
somewhere
in
there
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
i
believe
there
was.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
in
the
reply
we
have
cited
that
the
wisconsin
statute
which
requires
total
retention
just
like
the
michigan
waters
or
the
michigan
statute
but
then
there
is
an
exception
in
there,
for
the
waters
--
vessels
engaged
in
interstate
or
foreign
commerce
and
that
covers
every
vessel
involved
in
this
cause.
they
are
all
applying
back
and
forth
out
between
these
states.
so
in
appellants
underlying
that
definitely
was
drawn
that
wisconsin
has
excused
than
completely
from
any
retention.
i
say
to
site
to
wisconsin
statute
to
this
court
is
a
citation
of
the
lowest
form
of
pollution
control
of
sewage
disposal
from
vessels.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
about
28
of
them
do.
yes,
sir.
we
contest
in
the
record
that
the
secondary
treatment
which
they
claim
the
--
i
think
the
biogas
system
provides
is
as
good
as
the
secondary
treatment
now
in
fact
in
detroit.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
the
reasons
were
sir
that
these
vessels
are
in
moving
point
of
discharge
over
which
there
is
no
control.
now
in
the
sewage
outlets
from
municipalities,
we
can
control
that
area,
inspect
it,
designate
where
it
will
be
dumped.
apparently,
(inaudible)
throughout
the
lakes
dumping
without
regard
to
location,
we
can’t
control
that.
some
vessel
--
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
yes
right.
yes,
sir.
but
we
would
have
absolutely
no
control
if
some
dark
night,
a
vessel
of
the
appellants
came
skulking
on
the
michigan
shore
and
dumped
a
load.
i
say
it’s
a
matter
of
control
sir
--
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
because
sir,
the
actual
process
of
testing
this
effluent
is
partly
nonexistent
on
these
vessels.
we
can
test
it.
we
know
the
qualities
of
the
effluent
being
discharged
at
the
city
of
detroit
at
all
times.
it
takes
practically
a
chemical
engineer
to
perform
that
function.
and
none
of
the
answers
--
well
they
claim
that
secondary
treatment
which
they
say,
usually
28
of
their
vessels
exist.
when
the
(inaudible)
form
of
a
bacteria
comes
down
to
90%,
the
remaining
10%,
this
does
not
include
sir
what
we
call
the
pathogens.
the
bacteria
which
for
example
give
you
hepatitis,
typhus,
typhoid
fever,
dysentery
--
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
they
are
tested
for
anti
--.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
yes,
sir.
in
this
area,
we
are
now
set
aside
which
are
total
body
contact,
swimming
areas,
we
have
a
discharge
for
sewage
area
and
so
forth.
but
with
these
vessels,
there’s
no
control
over
the
area
in
which
they
would
make
this
dump.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
well,
actually
it
provides
failure
to
comply
with
the
statute
which
makes
any
holding
tank
or
other
total
retention
device
mandatory.
that
is
an
offense
under
the
michigan
statute.
yes,
sir.
but
--
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
$500.00
fine.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
according
to
the
figures
given
by
appellants,
yes.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
that’s
right
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
that
would
be
the
idea.
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
but
the
argument
they
make
concerning
the
necessity
for
uniformity,
in
response
with
this
fashion
must
take
michigan
for
the
sake
of
uniformity
bring
its
ultimate
and
best
requirement
for
this
problem
and
reduce
it
down
to
say
the
lowest
wisconsin.
now,
i
get
the
point
that
parties
are
driving
at.
they
like
to
or
hoping
for
federal
regulations
which
as
published
in
the
register
may
12,
1971
would
permit
dumping.
that’s
what
they
want,
they
want
to
continuous
dumping
even
though
with
treatment
facilities
and
even
though
in
the
most
of
the
proposed
rule
making,
they
were
told
that
holding
tanks,
the
michigan
requirement
would
be
acceptable
under
any
federal
rule
issue.
now
what?
they
know
that
if
they
complied
with
the
statute
they
would
be
inconformity
with
federal
law.
why
haven't
they
gone
along
to
accomplishing
things?
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
timewise
here,
we
realize
the
need
of
time
for
the
construction
of
erection
of
pump-out
facilities
that
is
necessary
and
there
would
be
no
enforcement
until
the
pump-out
facilities
were
available.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
to
the
michigan
water
resources
commission
to
institute
and
implement
the
program
regarding
pump-out
facilities,
i
am
sure.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
oh!
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
yes,
sir
we
do.
but
we
see
where
no
unreasonable
demand
could
be
made
on
these
people
if
within
--
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
the
carriers
and
under
the
michigan
statute.
the
michigan
agency
may
prescribed
which
docks,
roads,
and
so
forth
shall
provide
pump-out
facilities.
now
further
these
litigations,
we
really
have
been
in
amicably
in
this
cooperative
effort
working
with
the
carriers
for
the
solution
of
this
problem.
and
may
i
say
our
case
has
been
blown
out
of
proportion.
the
provision
for
pump-out
facilities
is
no
great
mechanical
accomplishment.
we
are
talking
about
in
any
cases
riding
(inaudible)
from
the
fault
to
a
municipal
sir.
that’s
all
and
we
know
that
the
case
is
the
cordoned
on
the
line
with
these
pump-out
stations,
the
tv
place
kind
of
blend
last
night,
so
i
started
doing
a
little
figure
and
attached
to
the
jurisdictional
statement,
are
number
of
charts
showing
all
of
the
thoughts
of
cause
and
the
way
these
vessels
may
under
throughout
the
great
lakes.
now,
counting
each
one
of
these
points
of
call,
i
found
about
40
of
them
in
michigan
at
which
taking
the
appellants
after
word
pump-out
stations
would
be
required.
ridiculous!
i
took
out
one
point,
where
he
lists
manistee,
filer
city,
and
ludington
as
ports
of
call
which
presumably
would
have
to
have
pump-out
stations,
i
am
mad
about
manistee
in
michigan
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
three
miles
from
manistee
to
filer
city
and
20
miles
to
ludington.
new
units
of
stock
at
all
as
you
pump-out
or
shore
of
michigan
there
are
eight
ports
of
car
list
in
one
area
in
the
port
here
in
the
area,
all
within
three
to
five
miles
of
each
other.
are
they
going
to
stop
it
or
all
of
them
pump-out.
so
the
issue
of
pump-out
stations
had
been
blown
out
of
proportion
--
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
i
believe
it
would
be
preempted,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
by
the
federal
statute.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
yes
sir,
that
would
be
in
compliance
with
federal
law.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
that
sir,
i
believe
is
a
debatable
question.
however
--
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
would
satisfy
federal
requirements.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
yes
sir.
if
all
means
(inaudible)
have
right
now
installed
holding
tanks.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
in
good
shape
federal
rights.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
not
so
if
the
federal
regulation
provided
for
discharge.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
well,
actual
issue
is
that
federal
requirement
going
to
deal
in
minimum
or
maximum
requirement.
we
don’t
know
at
this
time.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
yes
sir,
it
does.
it
says
that
after
the
effective
date
of
the
act,
the
states
may
not
enforce
their
statutes
or
regulations
with
reference
to
the
disposal
of
vessel
sewage.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
well
sir,
if
they
have
holding
tanks
which
will
lead
to
federal
requirement.
they
were
still
discharging.
i
have
an
idea
that
we
could
enforce
our
statute.
without
infringing,
can
bind
the
federal
requirements
concerning
same.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
oh!
sir
we
don’t
know.
they
haven’t
--
there
has
been
no
regulation
published
yet
and
under
the
law
it
does
not
become
effective
for
old
vessels
until
five
years
after
issuance
of
the
regulation.
and
remember,
that
in
this
case
we
are
talking
about
only
old
vessels.
new
vessels
which
has
a
two-year
requirement
are
those
vessels
which
are
constructive
after
the
effective
date
of
the
act.
now
in
the
meantime,
what
is
michigan
to
do?
or
are
there
some
impairment
of
its
waters?
or
all
this
defecation
of
what
nature
has
given
us
and
another
hypothetical,
state
congress
as
they
have
the
right
to
do
pick
up
to
five
year
requirement
and
then
came
with
50
or
20
year
requirement.
what
do
we
do,
stand
by
and
watch
michigan
waters
become
the
world’s
largest
(inaudible)?
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
right
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
in
fact
they
have
told
us
by
their
policy
to
go
ahead
and
work
at
this.
you
have
the
final
responsibility.
in
conclusion,
may
i
say
to
the
court,
that
i
believe
a
state
has
the
constitutional
right
to
protect
its
natural
advantages
and
prevent
them
from
any
further
impairment.
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
water
resources
act
of
1966
and
the
water
quality
act
of
1970
prescribed
to
be
the
national
policy
that
the
environment
of
this
country
including
its
waters
be
cleaned
up.
in
each
of
these
statutes,
they
have
placed
upon
the
states
the
primary
responsibility
for
implementing
that
policy.
in
view
in
michigan
in
the
case
of
the
sewage
disposal
from
vessels
has
enacted
a
statute
which
is
the
ultimate
in
that
area
mainly
complete
retention
of
sewage
and
dispose
off
the
(inaudible)
and
therefore,
i
am
somewhat
surprised
at
being
here.
in
response
to
the
question
of
mr.
justice
white
at
the
conclusion
of
yesterday’s
session,
i
say
that
the
only
controversy
now
existing
between
the
parties
in
this
cause
is
the
question
of
how
this
should
be
accomplished.
michigan
says
by
complete
retention
and
they
say,
no.
in
addition,
they
attacked
the
statute
on
numerous
constitutional
grounds.
that
is
the
only
controversy.
there
is
no
prosecution
pending
or
eminent
at
this
time.
we
realized
sir
the
futility
of
a
prosecution
at
this
time
with
inadequate
shore
size
pump-out
facilities.
but
we
are
working
on
that
and
we
are
making
headway
until
this
litigation
was
commenced.
we
realized
they
must
have
facilities
to
pump-out
before
the
law
could
be
properly
applied.
now,
i
might
go
a
little
further
and
say
insofar
as
the
controversy
goes,
there
is
a
controversy
between
the
parties
in
this
cause
as
to
what
constitutes
pollution
or
clean
water.
the
appellants
in
this
cause
evidently
say
that
by
the
use
of
certain
devices
on
their
vessels
by
which
they
can
pull
--
if
i
may
use
the
contradictory
term
clean
soil
into
wide
waters.
they
are
aiding
and
abetting
in
fulfilling
the
federal
requirements
that
pollution
of
our
waters
be
controlled.
michigan
says
otherwise,
we
say
in
effect
“thou
shalt
not
dump.”
now,
putting
in
its
proper
perspective,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
devices
which
these
plaintiffs
claim
will
range
in
their
waste
less
obnoxious
to
the
waters
of
the
state
of
michigan.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
record
shows
that
at
the
187
vessels
possessed
by
these
appellants,
only
some
50
have
a
device
of
any
kind.
in
other
words,
about
15%.
in
other
words,
you
have
about
85%
of
your
vessels
pouring
raw,
untreated
sewage
into
the
waters
of
the
great
lakes.
projecting
that
to
the
entire
great
lakes
fleet
of
some
422
vessels.
the
extent
of
their
deprivation
is
horrendous
to
be
hold.
it
is
a
special
problem
in
michigan.
we
are
surrounded
on
three
sides
as
the
court
knows
by
waters
of
the
great
lakes
with
the
longest
shoreline
in
this
country
except
for
alaska.
the
bulk
of
michigan
people
take
their
drinking
water
from
the
great
lakes.
for
example,
in
detroit
and
its
suburbs,
3,750,000
people,
that
was
the
figure
in
1970,
take
their
drinking
water
from
the
detroit
river
which
is
one
of
the
bodies
of
water
involved
in
this
litigation.
so
this
seriousness
of
the
situation
and
the
necessity
for
a
total
retention
requirement
by
michigan
is
also
obvious.
may
it
please
the
court,
probably
for
the
first
time
in
my
professional
career
i
was
pleased
to
receive
a
reply
brief
for
in
this
brief
filed
by
the
appellants,
i
believe
the
verity
of
our
cause
is
proved.
they
say
and
for
the
first
time
they
recognized
that
michigan
has
a
problem
and
they
say
that
the
problem
is
solved
by
the
quarantine
regulations
issued
by
the
public
health
service
under
the
guidance
of
the
surgeon
general
in
1960.
now,
i
do
not
intend
to
be
snide
or
patched
in
this
remark.
brother
elder
has
conducted
himself
in
accordance
with
the
highest
standards
of
the
profession
during
the
conduct
of
this
litigation.
by
the
at
least
1960
regulation
of
the
surgeon
general
was
of
such
significance
in
this
cause.
why
was
it
not
before
the
district
court
in
the
1971
trial
of
this
case?
i
read
the
surgeon
general’s
requirements
your
honor
insofar
as
at
least
michigan
is
concerned
are
quite
meaningless
numbered
paragraph
3
for
example,
exempts
from
the
requirements
vessels
which
have
sewage
disposal
devices.
i
have
just
given
you
the
figures
showing
how
few
of
these
vessels
have
any
device
whatsoever.
further
in
number
paragraph
1
of
the
regulations,
it
says
that
all
vessels
moored
shall
not
discharge
sewage,
etcetera
into
the
waters
if
there
are
dockside
facilities
available
for
the
disposition
of
same.
well,
that
is
one
of
the
complaints
of
appellants
in
this
cause
that
there
are
no
pump-out
facilities
anywhere.
although
under
the
surgeon
general’s
regulations,
these
people
just
continue
to
dump
and
the
basic
requirement
of
the
surgeon
general
requirement
is
that
there
shall
be
no
disposal
of
sewage
within
three
miles
of
a
public
water
intake.
well,
your
honor,
that
presupposes
that
the
way
we
use
the
water,
the
current
and
even
the
sun
are
just
perfect
and
that
the
effluent
dumped
will
remain
in
one
spot.
those
living
at
the
midwest
would
know
that
such
a
day
has
never
occurred.
and
insofar
as
three-mile
pump-out
prohibition
is
concerned
at
a
three
mile
radius,
the
detroit
river
river
from
which
i
said
3,750,000
people
take
their
water
supply
is
that
at
its
widest
point
in
mile
and
a
half.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
yes,
sir
we
do.
if
there
are
controversy
of
michigan
waters
--
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
well,
there
is
--
there
is
by
name
boundary
line
drawn
by
commission
years
ago
between
the
states
above
wisconsin
and
michigan
out
about
approximately
the
middle
of
lake
michigan
which
is
known
as
the
boundary
between
michigan
and
wisconsin
and
they
are
referred
to
and
any
federal
statute
refers
to
the
boundary
waters
of
the
state.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
yes,
sir.
now,
i
realized
the
practical
problem.
we
of
course
have
no
jurisdiction
in
wisconsin
waters.
we
don’t
have
sewage
dumped
in
wisconsin
waters
anymore
than
in
ours.
but
the
practical
situation
is
that
jurisdiction
wise
we
may
only
enforce
a
requirement
within
the
perview
of
michigan’s
boundary
waters.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
yes.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
sir,
there
was
a
boundary
commission
between
comprised
of
michigan
and
wisconsin
officials
over
ten
years
ago
wherein
this
boundary
was
drawn.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
ten
or
15
years
somewhere
in
there
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
i
believe
there
was.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
in
the
reply
we
have
cited
that
the
wisconsin
statute
which
requires
total
retention
just
like
the
michigan
waters
or
the
michigan
statute
but
then
there
is
an
exception
in
there,
for
the
waters
--
vessels
engaged
in
interstate
or
foreign
commerce
and
that
covers
every
vessel
involved
in
this
cause.
they
are
all
applying
back
and
forth
out
between
these
states.
so
in
appellants
underlying
that
definitely
was
drawn
that
wisconsin
has
excused
than
completely
from
any
retention.
i
say
to
site
to
wisconsin
statute
to
this
court
is
a
citation
of
the
lowest
form
of
pollution
control
of
sewage
disposal
from
vessels.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
about
28
of
them
do.
yes,
sir.
we
contest
in
the
record
that
the
secondary
treatment
which
they
claim
the
--
i
think
the
biogas
system
provides
is
as
good
as
the
secondary
treatment
now
in
fact
in
detroit.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
the
reasons
were
sir
that
these
vessels
are
in
moving
point
of
discharge
over
which
there
is
no
control.
now
in
the
sewage
outlets
from
municipalities,
we
can
control
that
area,
inspect
it,
designate
where
it
will
be
dumped.
apparently,
(inaudible)
throughout
the
lakes
dumping
without
regard
to
location,
we
can’t
control
that.
some
vessel
--
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
yes
right.
yes,
sir.
but
we
would
have
absolutely
no
control
if
some
dark
night,
a
vessel
of
the
appellants
came
skulking
on
the
michigan
shore
and
dumped
a
load.
i
say
it’s
a
matter
of
control
sir
--
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
because
sir,
the
actual
process
of
testing
this
effluent
is
partly
nonexistent
on
these
vessels.
we
can
test
it.
we
know
the
qualities
of
the
effluent
being
discharged
at
the
city
of
detroit
at
all
times.
it
takes
practically
a
chemical
engineer
to
perform
that
function.
and
none
of
the
answers
--
well
they
claim
that
secondary
treatment
which
they
say,
usually
28
of
their
vessels
exist.
when
the
(inaudible)
form
of
a
bacteria
comes
down
to
90%,
the
remaining
10%,
this
does
not
include
sir
what
we
call
the
pathogens.
the
bacteria
which
for
example
give
you
hepatitis,
typhus,
typhoid
fever,
dysentery
--
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
they
are
tested
for
anti
--.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
yes,
sir.
in
this
area,
we
are
now
set
aside
which
are
total
body
contact,
swimming
areas,
we
have
a
discharge
for
sewage
area
and
so
forth.
but
with
these
vessels,
there’s
no
control
over
the
area
in
which
they
would
make
this
dump.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
well,
actually
it
provides
failure
to
comply
with
the
statute
which
makes
any
holding
tank
or
other
total
retention
device
mandatory.
that
is
an
offense
under
the
michigan
statute.
yes,
sir.
but
--
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
$500.00
fine.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
according
to
the
figures
given
by
appellants,
yes.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
that’s
right
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
that
would
be
the
idea.
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
but
the
argument
they
make
concerning
the
necessity
for
uniformity,
in
response
with
this
fashion
must
take
michigan
for
the
sake
of
uniformity
bring
its
ultimate
and
best
requirement
for
this
problem
and
reduce
it
down
to
say
the
lowest
wisconsin.
now,
i
get
the
point
that
parties
are
driving
at.
they
like
to
or
hoping
for
federal
regulations
which
as
published
in
the
register
may
12,
1971
would
permit
dumping.
that’s
what
they
want,
they
want
to
continuous
dumping
even
though
with
treatment
facilities
and
even
though
in
the
most
of
the
proposed
rule
making,
they
were
told
that
holding
tanks,
the
michigan
requirement
would
be
acceptable
under
any
federal
rule
issue.
now
what?
they
know
that
if
they
complied
with
the
statute
they
would
be
inconformity
with
federal
law.
why
haven't
they
gone
along
to
accomplishing
things?
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
timewise
here,
we
realize
the
need
of
time
for
the
construction
of
erection
of
pump-out
facilities
that
is
necessary
and
there
would
be
no
enforcement
until
the
pump-out
facilities
were
available.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
to
the
michigan
water
resources
commission
to
institute
and
implement
the
program
regarding
pump-out
facilities,
i
am
sure.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
oh!
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
yes,
sir
we
do.
but
we
see
where
no
unreasonable
demand
could
be
made
on
these
people
if
within
--
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
the
carriers
and
under
the
michigan
statute.
the
michigan
agency
may
prescribed
which
docks,
roads,
and
so
forth
shall
provide
pump-out
facilities.
now
further
these
litigations,
we
really
have
been
in
amicably
in
this
cooperative
effort
working
with
the
carriers
for
the
solution
of
this
problem.
and
may
i
say
our
case
has
been
blown
out
of
proportion.
the
provision
for
pump-out
facilities
is
no
great
mechanical
accomplishment.
we
are
talking
about
in
any
cases
riding
(inaudible)
from
the
fault
to
a
municipal
sir.
that’s
all
and
we
know
that
the
case
is
the
cordoned
on
the
line
with
these
pump-out
stations,
the
tv
place
kind
of
blend
last
night,
so
i
started
doing
a
little
figure
and
attached
to
the
jurisdictional
statement,
are
number
of
charts
showing
all
of
the
thoughts
of
cause
and
the
way
these
vessels
may
under
throughout
the
great
lakes.
now,
counting
each
one
of
these
points
of
call,
i
found
about
40
of
them
in
michigan
at
which
taking
the
appellants
after
word
pump-out
stations
would
be
required.
ridiculous!
i
took
out
one
point,
where
he
lists
manistee,
filer
city,
and
ludington
as
ports
of
call
which
presumably
would
have
to
have
pump-out
stations,
i
am
mad
about
manistee
in
michigan
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
three
miles
from
manistee
to
filer
city
and
20
miles
to
ludington.
new
units
of
stock
at
all
as
you
pump-out
or
shore
of
michigan
there
are
eight
ports
of
car
list
in
one
area
in
the
port
here
in
the
area,
all
within
three
to
five
miles
of
each
other.
are
they
going
to
stop
it
or
all
of
them
pump-out.
so
the
issue
of
pump-out
stations
had
been
blown
out
of
proportion
--
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
i
believe
it
would
be
preempted,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
by
the
federal
statute.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
yes
sir,
that
would
be
in
compliance
with
federal
law.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
that
sir,
i
believe
is
a
debatable
question.
however
--
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
would
satisfy
federal
requirements.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
yes
sir.
if
all
means
(inaudible)
have
right
now
installed
holding
tanks.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
in
good
shape
federal
rights.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
not
so
if
the
federal
regulation
provided
for
discharge.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
well,
actual
issue
is
that
federal
requirement
going
to
deal
in
minimum
or
maximum
requirement.
we
don’t
know
at
this
time.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
yes
sir,
it
does.
it
says
that
after
the
effective
date
of
the
act,
the
states
may
not
enforce
their
statutes
or
regulations
with
reference
to
the
disposal
of
vessel
sewage.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
well
sir,
if
they
have
holding
tanks
which
will
lead
to
federal
requirement.
they
were
still
discharging.
i
have
an
idea
that
we
could
enforce
our
statute.
without
infringing,
can
bind
the
federal
requirements
concerning
same.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
oh!
sir
we
don’t
know.
they
haven’t
--
there
has
been
no
regulation
published
yet
and
under
the
law
it
does
not
become
effective
for
old
vessels
until
five
years
after
issuance
of
the
regulation.
and
remember,
that
in
this
case
we
are
talking
about
only
old
vessels.
new
vessels
which
has
a
two-year
requirement
are
those
vessels
which
are
constructive
after
the
effective
date
of
the
act.
now
in
the
meantime,
what
is
michigan
to
do?
or
are
there
some
impairment
of
its
waters?
or
all
this
defecation
of
what
nature
has
given
us
and
another
hypothetical,
state
congress
as
they
have
the
right
to
do
pick
up
to
five
year
requirement
and
then
came
with
50
or
20
year
requirement.
what
do
we
do,
stand
by
and

in
fact
they
have
told
us
by
their
policy
to
go
ahead
and
work
at
this.
you
have
the
final
responsibility.
in
conclusion,
may
i
say
to
the
court,
that
i
believe
a
state
has
the
constitutional
right
to
protect
its
natural
advantages
and
prevent
them
from
any
further
impairment.
thank
