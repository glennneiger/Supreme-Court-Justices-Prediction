mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writs
of
certiorari
to
the
second
circuit,
presents
two
questions
concerning
the
extent
to
which
the
duty
to
bargain
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
survives
a
change
in
employers.
the
first
question
is
whether
burns
international
protective
agency
which
took
over
wackenhut’s
job
of
furnishing
guard
services,
lockheed
is
a
successor
to
wackenhut
for
purposes
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
second,
if
burns
is
a
successor
employer,
is
it
obliged
not
only
to
recognize
and
bargain
with
the
union
represented
by
wackenhut’s
employees
or
also
obliged
to
honor
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
which
wackenhut
had
entered
into
with
the
union
covering
these
employees.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
would
say
the
fact
that
they
--
well,
as
i
will
develop
further
to
continuity
of
the
employing
enterprise
is
the
test
and
among
the
factors
that
are
very
crucial
there
is
the
complement
of
the
workforce
and
had
they
not
employed
for
nondiscriminatory
reasons,
the
wackenhut
employees,
that
would
be
a
big
factor
for
holding
that
they
were
not
a
successor.
whether
it
would
be
conclusive
or
not,
i
will
develop
as
i
get
to
it.
the
basic
facts
here
are
these.
from
july
1,
1962
to
july
1,
1967,
wackenhut,
a
nationwide
guard
service
provided
plant
protection
services
for
lockheed
aircraft
service
corporation,
a
subsidiary
of
the
lockheed
aircraft
corporation
at
its
facility
at
the
ontario
airport
in
california.
what
lockheed
was
doing
there
was
serving,
was
maintaining
and
repairing
planes
and
wackenhut
was
supplying
guard
service
for
the
lockheed
operation.
on
march
8,
1967,
the
board
certified
the
united
plant
guard
workers
as
the
exclusive
bargaining
representative
of
the
wackenhut
employees
working
at
the
lockheed
airport
facility.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
was
a
unit
of
about
42
employees.
on
april
29,
1967,
about
a
month
after
the
certification,
wackenhut
and
the
union
entered
into
a
three-year
collective
bargaining
agreement
covering
these
employees
and
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
among
other
things
contained
a
clause
making
the
agreement
binding
on
successors
and
assigns.
lockheed's
then
current
service
contract
with
wackenhut
was
due
to
expire
on
june
10,
1967
unless
extended
by
lockheed.
in
may
of
1967,
lockheed
invited
various
guard
services,
including
wackenhut
to
bid
or
rebid
the
job.
on
may
15,
lockheed
advised
the
prospective
bidders
including
burns,
that
wackenhut’s
guards
were
represented
by
the
united
plant
guard
workers
who
had
been
certified
by
the
board
and
that
there
was
an
outstanding
collective
bargaining
agreement
between
wackenhut
and
the
union
covering
those
employees.
although,
wackenhut
submitted
a
bid,
the
successful
bidder
was
burns.
in
the
next
moth,
june
of
1967,
wackenhut
or
burns
sought
to
employ
when
it
took
over
on
july
1
as
many
of
the
wackenhut
guards
as
possible
for
the
reason
that
they
had,
they
cleared
security
and
top
security
clearance
that
was
needed
for
this
type
of
work.
the
wackenhut
guards
applied
for
jobs
with
burns.
as
they
did
so,
burns’
officials
in
turn
assisted
the
american
federation
of
guards,
another
union
with
whom
wackenhut
had
a
contract
covering
its
employees
in
los
angeles
county.
that
contract
did
not
cover
these
employees
because
this
was
in
san
bernardino
county,
but
nonetheless,
burns
assisted
the
american
federation
of
guards
in
obtaining
membership
applications
from
the
wackenhut
guards
as
they
came
to
apply
for
jobs
with
burns.
representatives
of
burns
told
the
guards
that
they
could
not
get
uniforms
without
signing
american
federation
of
guards
membership
cards
and
that
they
had
to
join
the
american
federation
of
guards
in
order
to
work
for
burns.
on
june
29,
burns’s
branch
manager
concluding
that
a
majority
of
the
employees
to
be
used
that
the
lockheed
airport
job
had
signed
american
federation
of
guards
membership
applications
or
were
already
members
of
that
union
recognized
the
american
federation
of
guards
as
their
bargaining
representative.
wackenhut
had
terminated
its
guard
service
at
midnight
on
june
30
and
burns
began
to
furnish
such
service
on
july
1.
on
that
date,
burns'
lockheed
force
like
wackenhut’s
consisted
of
42
guards.
of
the
42,
27
or
more
than
a
majority
had
formally
been
employed
by
wackenhut
and
15
guards
were
transferred
from
other
burns’
jobs.
the
burns
guards
performed
essentially
the
same
tasks
at
the
same
stations
that
the
wackenhut
guards
had
performed.
moreover,
although
burns
used
its
own
supervisors,
their
functions
and
responsibilities
were
similar
to
those
of
their
wackenhut
predecessors,
both
utilize
area
supervisors
who
perform
similar
functions
and
both
had
full
time
supervisors
on
the
lockheed
job
with
similar
functions.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
believe
all
of
them.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
they
were
already
members.
they
were
apparently
transferred
from
the
los
angeles
county
and
thus
were
under
the
burns’
contract
with
the
american
federation
of
guards
which
i
believe
had
a
union
security
clause
as
did
the
united
plant
guards
contract
with
wackenhut.
on
july
12,
the
united
plant
guard
workers
requested
that
burns
recognize
it
as
the
bargaining
representative
of
the
burns
employees
at
lockheed
and
honor
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
it
had
with
wackenhut.
burns
refused
and
the
union
filed
unfair
labor
practice
charges
with
the
board.
the
board
found
that
the
--
that
burns
violated
section
8
(a)
(2)
and
(1)
of
the
act
which
prohibits
illegal
assistance
by
an
employer
to
a
labor
organization
by
assisting
the
american
federation
of
guards
in
organizing
and
by
recognizing
american
federation
of
guards
when
it
did
not
represent
an
un-coerced
majority
of
burns’
employees.
this
finding
was
sustained
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
it
is
not
an
issue
here.
the
board
also
found
that
a
bargaining
unit
limited
that
the
guards
working
at
the
lockheed
airport
facility
was
appropriate,
that
burns
continued
essentially
the
same
operation
at
that
plant
that
wackenhut
had,
and
therefore,
it
was
a
successor
employer
to
wackenhut
and
accordingly
the
board
held
that
burns
violated
section
8
(a)
(5)
and
(1)
of
the
act
by
refusing
to
recognize
and
bargain
with
the
united
plant
guards.
finally,
the
board
drawing
support
from
this
court’s
decision
in
wiley
against
livingston
which
i
will
get
to
later,
the
board
held
that
as
a
successor
to
wackenhut,
burns
was
obliged
to
honor
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
between
wackenhut
and
the
united
plant
guard
workers
and
that
by
refusing
to
do
that
that
was
an
additional
violation
of
the
bargaining
obligation.
the
court
of
appeals
in
an
opinion
by
judge
hayes
sustained
the
board’s
finding
as
i
indicated,
the
bear
legal
assistance,
sustained
the
board’s
finding
of
--
that
burns
was
a
successor,
sustained
the
finding
that
there
was
a
refusal
to
bargain
and
burns
refusing
to
recognize
united
plant
guard
workers
as
a
representative
of
the
employees,
but
held
that
the
board
had
exceeded
its
powers
under
the
statute
in
finding
that
there
was
also
a
further
refusal
to
bargain
in
failing
to
honor
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
both
the
successor
issue
and
the
propriety
of
the
board’s
finding
requiring
a
contract
to
be
honored
before
this
court
on
a
cross
petition
for
certiorari.
now,
as
this
court
knows
in
enacting
the
national
labor
relations
act,
congress
made
the
policy
declaration,
section
1
of
the
act
that
protection
by
law
of
the
right
of
employees
are
organized
and
bargained
collectively,
safeguards
commerce
from
interruption
by
removing
a
frequent
source
of
industrial
strike.
the
way
the
board
--
the
act
implements
that
policy
is
to
provide
a
procedure
whereby
the
board
can
conduct
a
secret
ballot
election
and
get
the
employees'
wishes
concerning
a
bargaining
representative.
if
a
majority
vote
for
them,
it
certifies
them
as
the
exclusive
bargaining
representative
under
section
8
(a)
(5)
of
the
act,
it
is
a
refusal
to
bargain,
to
refuse
to
honor
the
certification.
furthermore,
since
the
act
also
rests
on
the
premise
that
industrial
pieces
promoted
by
maintaining
stability
into
bargaining
relationship,
a
board
certification
is
normally
not
subject
to
challenge
for
one
year.
this
court
endorsed
the
board’s
rule
to
that
effect
in
the
brooks
case
or
longer,
if
there
is
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
of
reasonable
duration
and
under
court
principles
that
had
been
approved
by
the
courts
collective
bargaining
agreement
of
up
to
three
years
is
normally
regarded
as
reasonable
duration.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes
sir.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor
those
are
the
only
two
questions
as
i
understand
it.
now,
in
line
with
the
general
principles
that
i
have
just
outlined,
had
burns
remained
the
employer
here,
it
would
have
been
obliged
to
recognize
the
united
plant
guard
workers,
during
life
of
the
three-year
collective
bargaining
agreement,
notwithstanding
any
changes
in
the
complement
of
the
employees
that
occurred
during
the
life
of
that
agreement
and
if
wackenhut
had
repudiated
that
agreement
or
it
unilaterally
modified
its
wage
provisions
or
any
other
provision
relating
to
the
employees
terms
and
conditions
of
employment,
it
would
not
only
have
been
subject
to
a
suit
for
breach
of
the
agreement
under
section
301
of
the
labor
management
relations
act,
but
it
would
have
violated
section
8
(d)
and
therefore
8
(a)
(5)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
well
because
section
8
(d)
provides
in
relevant
part
that
where
there
is
in
effect
a
collective
bargaining
contract,
the
duty
to
bargain
collective
shall
mean
that
no
party
to
such
contract
shall
terminate
or
modify
such
contract
without
giving
prescribed
notice
and
waiting
until
the
expiration
date
of
such
contract.
and
as
i
understand
it,
nothing
in
this
court’s
recent
decision
in
pittsburgh
plate
glass
affects
this
general
principle
because
this
contract
almost
exclusively,
if
not
exclusively
dealt
with
mandatory
subjects
of
bargain.
now,
i
do
not
understand
that
burns
disagrees
with
what
i
have
just
been
setting
forth
as
the
obligation
that
would
have
been
imposed
on
wackenhut
nor
do
i
understand
that
there
is
any
disagreement
with
the
next
point
that
i
am
going
to
make.
namely
that
early
in
the
administration
of
the
act,
the
board
evolved
the
doctrine
and
it
has
been
uniformly
approved
by
the
court
of
appeals,
although
this
court
has
never
had
occasion
specifically
to
pass
on
it,
that
the
mere
transfer
of
operations
from
employer
to
another
does
not
distinguish
--
extinguish
the
obligation
of
bargain
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
such
claims
for
a
leave
substantially
in
fact
the
identity
of
the
employing
enterprise
then
the
duty
of
the
original
employer
to
recognize
and
bargain
with
an
incumbent
union
evolves
upon
the
new
employer
as
a
successor
employer.
the
rationale
for
the
doctrine
is
simply
this.
that
if
the
employing
enterprise
remains
intact,
continuation
of
a
bargaining
obligation
serves
the
policy
of
averting
industrial
strike
in
that
enterprise
no
less
than
that
--
by
imposing
that
obligation
upon
the
successor
employer
then
did
imposing
it
on
the
original
employer.
moreover,
where
you
have
maintained
the
employing
enterprise,
there
is
little
reason
to
believe
that
the
employees’
original
choice
of
a
bargaining
representative
would
have
been
altered
by
the
mere
change
in
employers.
the
point
at
which
the
difference
between
us
develops
is
what
are
the
criteria
for
determining
whether
you
have
a
successor
employer
for
purposes
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
that
also
gets
back
to
the
chief
justice’s
question.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes
you
have
your
honor
and
it
is
burns’
point
that
that
does
make
a
difference
as
that
distinguishes
--
that
distinction
should
be
drawn
between
this
kind
of
a
situation
in
one
where
you
have
a
more
conventional
transfer
of
assets
or
of
facilities.
we
submit
and
we
believe
that
the
cases
in
the
court
of
appeals
support
our
submission
that
so
long
as
the
new
employer
ends
up
with
substantially
the
same
bargaining
unit
or
industrial
community
as
it
sometimes
called,
he
is
a
successor
employer
for
purposes
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
whether
he
does
that
as
a
result
of
direct
dealing
with
the
prior
employer
or
he
does
it
through
dealing
with
a
third
party
as
was
done
in
this
case
because
the
important
thing
as
i
tried
to
indicate
the
important
rationale
for
writing
this
--
the
loss
of
the
successor
employer
on
the
bargaining
obligation
is
that
the
change
in
employer
has
not
made
a
significant
change
in
the
bargaining
unit
which
had
originally
selected
the
union
as
the
employees’
representative.
and
that
is
what
we
had
here
because
irrespective
of
how
burns
ended
up
with
the
contract
and
the
findings
of
the
board
as
sustained
by
the
court
of
appeals
you
had
a
situation
where,
i
am
quoting
from
the
court
of
appeals
appendix
189,
“both
burns
and
wackenhut
are
a
nationwide
organizations.
both
perform
the
identical
services
at
the
same
facility,
namely
providing
plant
protection
service
for
lockheed.
although
burns
used
its
own
supervisors,
their
functions
and
responsibilities
were
similar
to
those
performed
by
their
predecessors
and
finally
and
perhaps
most
significantly,
burns
commenced
performance
of
the
contract
with
27
former
wackenhut
employees
out
of
its
total
complement
of
42.
moreover,
as
shown
by
burns’
assistance
to
the
american
federation
of
plant
guards,
it
too
recognized
this
lockheed
operation
as
a
separate
operation,
as
a
separate
bargaining
unit.”
so
that,
we
submit
that
since
the
change
in
from
wackenhut
to
burns
that
is
substantially
intact,
the
employment
conditions
at
the
enterprise
that
is
involved
there,
namely
the
supplying
of
the
guard
services
to
lockheed
which
was
a
separate
unit,
the
board
properly
found
that
burns
is
a
successor
employer
to
wackenhut
and
which
brings
me
to
the
second
question
as
to
whether
burns
was
not
only
obligated
to
recognize
and
bargain
with
united
plant
guard
workers’
union
and
prohibited
from
making
any
unilateral
changes
in
existing
working
conditions
without
first
bargaining
with
the
union
and
whether
it
was
also
obliged
to
honor
the
contract.
now
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
probably
--
it
had
about
two-and-a-half
years
i
would
say.
it
was
entered
into
in
--
perhaps
even
more
than
two-and-a-half
years,
it
was
entered
into
in
april
29,
1967
and
burns
took
over
on
july
1,
1967.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
was
a
three-year
contract.
there
would
be
no
question
that
wackenhut
would
have
been
required
to
honor
the
contract
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
for
three-year
time.
mr.
norton
j.
come
as
i
recall
it,
it
was
not.
three-year
contracts
are
not
uncommon
in
collective
bargaining.
there
was
a
time
when
a
one-year
contract
was
the
rule,
then
it
went
to
two
years
and
now
three
years
as
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
is
very
standard.
now
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
after
the
new
agreement
had
been
signed
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
at
the
time
that
they
--
before
they
signed
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
would
like
to
respond
to
mr.
justice
brennan’s
question
and
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
at
the
luncheon
break,
justice
brennan
asked
whether
there
was
any
indication
that
bids
would
be
lead
at
the
time
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
was
entered
into.
so
far
as
the
record
shows
there
was
no
indication
other
than
the
fact
that
lockheed
contract
with
wackenhut
was
a
year
contract
that
was
subject
to
removal.
however,
for
the
last
five
years
wackenhut
had
been
retained
to
perform
the
guard
service
at
this
installation
and
from
all
that
appears
in
the
record
it
had
every
intention
of
remaining
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
the
record
does
not
show.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
record
does
not.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
refer
you
to
appendix
10.
mr.
norton
j.
come
in
which
the
board
says,
we
find
therefore
that
burns
is
bound
to
that
contract
as
if
it
were
a
signatory
thereto.
it's
failure
to
maintain
the
contract
in
effect
is
violative
of
sections
8
(d)
and
8
(a)
(5).
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
you
have
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
which
is
the
unfair
labor
practice,
8
(a)
(5)
mr.
norton
j.
come
which
says
that
it
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
to
fail
the
bargain
collectively.
now
8
(d)
defines
large
part
what
constitutes
a
failure
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes
your
honor.
now,
to
be
sure
wiley
only
compelled
arbitration,
however
the
considerations
upon
which
the
court
compelled
a
non-consenting
employer
to
the
contract
to
go
to
arbitration
under
that
contract
we
submit
are
precisely
the
same
considerations
that
justified
the
board
in
applying
the
same
principle
to
its
interpretation
of
8
(d).
the
court
relied
upon
the
fact
that
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
not
in
any
real
sense,
the
simple
product
of
a
consensual
relationship;
it
is
a
cold
governing,
an
industrial
community
that
is
negotiated
under
the
principles
and
requirements
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
it
binds
employees
who
did
not
even
consent
to
the
contract
or
weren't
even
employed
at
the
time
it
was
negotiating
and
may
not
even
be
a
member
of
the
union
which
negotiated
it,
but
albeit
a
member
of
the
bargaining
unit
if
the
union
has
to
represent.
more
importantly
the
court
relied
upon
the
fact
that
the
objective
of
national
labor
policy
requires
that
the
rightful
prerogatives
of
owners
independently
to
rearrange
their
businesses
and
even
eliminate
themselves
as
employers,
be
balanced
by
some
protection
to
employees
from
a
sudden
change
in
the
employment
relationship
because
the
employee
and
the
union
usually
does
not
have
a
say
in
these
transfer
negotiations
and
we
submit
that
that
is
a
fortiori
in
an
industry
like
the
service
industry
which
is
subject
to
its
rapid
turn
on.
finally
the
court
relied
upon
the
fact
that
industrial
strife
could
be
avoided
by
submitting
employees’
claims
to
arbitration
leave
it
--
rather
than
leaving
them
to
a
test
of
economic
powers.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
as
to
--
if
the
contract
is
applicable,
the
extent
to
which
he
has
to
abide
by
the
contract,
the
extent
to
which
he
can
make
changes
to
meet
his
situation
are
all
matters
that
he
is
free
to
bargain
with
the
union
about
and
failing
an
agreement
to
take
to
the
arbitration.
the
board’s
decision
here
far
from
being
in
derogation
of
arbitration,
permits
arbitration
to
work.
all
the
board
is
saying
here
is
that
if
you
are
a
successor
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
we
have
defined
it,
you
have
taken
over
willingly
this
employing
enterprise,
you
just
cannot
say
that
you
are
not
going
to
pay
any
attention
to
the
(voice
overlap)
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
he
may
be
free
at
the
decision
as
to
what
are
--
before
he
takes
over
the
business
as
to
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
they
might
have
although
they
were
not
subject
to
that
contract
originally,
but
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
at
the
time
that
he
took
over,
i
mean
before
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
they
were
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
there
were
27
--
there
were
42
members
of
the
wackenhut
workforce
when
wackenhut
shut
down.
burns
employed,
i
believe
it
was
27
of
those
members
of
the
workforce.
mr.
norton
j.
come
conceivably
they
would
have
had
grievance
under
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
they
were
--
that
they
would
have
but
at
that
point,
however
i
mean,
the
reason
i
am
hedging
is
that
they
were
discharged
by
wackenhut
and
their
contracts
of
employment
were
not
renewed
by
burns
(voice
overlap)
mr.
norton
j.
come
but
in
any
event
this
is
a
problem
for
the
arbitrator.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
your
honor.
in
formulating
the
principle
in
this
case
the
board
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
board
--
the
board
found
a
successorship
in
emerald
maintenance
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
did
not
bind
them
to
the
contract
because
in
burns
as
mr.
justice
stewart
indicated
earlier
the
board
had
a
caveat
in
there
for
unusual
circumstances
and
the
board
found
that
the
peculiarities
of
government
procurement
practice
coupled
with
wage
determinations
under
the
service
contract
act
created
a
situation
where
at
least
with
respect
to
certain
types
of
government
contracts,
there
was
not
the
flexibility
for
negotiation
that
was
present
in
the
typical
civilian
type
of
contract
which
is
what
we
have
here.
we
do
not
have
here
lockheed’s
government
contracts
involved
in
this
case.
now,
i
--
if
i
may
be
permitted
to
just
make
one
other
point.
wiley
also,
we
submit,
disposes
of
the
contention
that
what
the
board
is
doing
here
is
writing
a
contract
for
the
parties
because
the
court
in
wiley
specifically
pointed
out
at
this
case,
where
they
had
found
the
kind
of
continuity
that
you
had
in
wiley,
the
continuity
here
is
much
stronger
than
you
had
in
wiley.
the
court
said
this
case
cannot
readily
be
assimilated
to
the
category
of
those
in
which
there
is
no
contract
whatever
or
none
which
is
reasonably
related
to
the
parties
sought
to
be
obligated.
it
was
a
contract
and
interscience,
wiley’s
predecessor
was
party
to
it.
we
submit
that
is
precisely
the
situation
here
a
fortiori
in
view
of
the
substantial
identity
with
the
original
workforce.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
i
do
not
think
so.
mr.
norton
j.
come
but
the
the
grievance
does
not
mean
that
they
will
prevail.
i
mean,
if
there
were
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
this
is
a
question
that
the
arbitrator
would
have
to
determine
as
to
whether
or
not
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
but,
query
whether
it
would
not
be
cause
under
the
contract
for
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--
for
wackenhut
to
say
that
since
i
am
closing
down
my
operation,
i
am
terminating
you
as
of
5
o’clock
tomorrow.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
they
certainly
were
here
because
burns
voluntarily
took
over
a
majority
of
the
wackenhut
employees
for
reasons
that
were
of
advantage
to
its
own
operation
(voice
overlap).
mr.
norton
j.
come
we
do
not
go
that
far.
we
do
not
think
that
you
have
to
go
that
far
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
would
not
say
that
it
has
to
be
a
majority.
i
think
it
has
a
substantial
number
as
to
be
enough
to
give
you
a
continuity
of
employment
conditions
in
the
bargaining
unit.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
am
not
prepared
to
go
that
far,
your
honor.
i
think
that
there
may
be
a
difference
for
purposes
of
compelling
arbitration
under
301
and
what
would
be
the
rule
for
purposes
of
establishing
a
bargaining
obligation
or
representation
status
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
court
in
wiley
was
very
careful
to
indicate
that
it
was
not
passing
on
the
question
as
to
whether
you
had
enough
there
to
impose
representation
status
on
the
union.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
has
been
a
pleasure.
mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writs
of
certiorari
to
the
second
circuit,
presents
two
questions
concerning
the
extent
to
which
the
duty
to
bargain
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
survives
a
change
in
employers.
the
first
question
is
whether
burns
international
protective
agency
which
took
over
wackenhut’s
job
of
furnishing
guard
services,
lockheed
is
a
successor
to
wackenhut
for
purposes
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
second,
if
burns
is
a
successor
employer,
is
it
obliged
not
only
to
recognize
and
bargain
with
the
union
represented
by
wackenhut’s
employees
or
also
obliged
to
honor
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
which
wackenhut
had
entered
into
with
the
union
covering
these
employees.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
would
say
the
fact
that
they
--
well,
as
i
will
develop
further
to
continuity
of
the
employing
enterprise
is
the
test
and
among
the
factors
that
are
very
crucial
there
is
the
complement
of
the
workforce
and
had
they
not
employed
for
nondiscriminatory
reasons,
the
wackenhut
employees,
that
would
be
a
big
factor
for
holding
that
they
were
not
a
successor.
whether
it
would
be
conclusive
or
not,
i
will
develop
as
i
get
to
it.
the
basic
facts
here
are
these.
from
july
1,
1962
to
july
1,
1967,
wackenhut,
a
nationwide
guard
service
provided
plant
protection
services
for
lockheed
aircraft
service
corporation,
a
subsidiary
of
the
lockheed
aircraft
corporation
at
its
facility
at
the
ontario
airport
in
california.
what
lockheed
was
doing
there
was
serving,
was
maintaining
and
repairing
planes
and
wackenhut
was
supplying
guard
service
for
the
lockheed
operation.
on
march
8,
1967,
the
board
certified
the
united
plant
guard
workers
as
the
exclusive
bargaining
representative
of
the
wackenhut
employees
working
at
the
lockheed
airport
facility.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
was
a
unit
of
about
42
employees.
on
april
29,
1967,
about
a
month
after
the
certification,
wackenhut
and
the
union
entered
into
a
three-year
collective
bargaining
agreement
covering
these
employees
and
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
among
other
things
contained
a
clause
making
the
agreement
binding
on
successors
and
assigns.
lockheed's
then
current
service
contract
with
wackenhut
was
due
to
expire
on
june
10,
1967
unless
extended
by
lockheed.
in
may
of
1967,
lockheed
invited
various
guard
services,
including
wackenhut
to
bid
or
rebid
the
job.
on
may
15,
lockheed
advised
the
prospective
bidders
including
burns,
that
wackenhut’s
guards
were
represented
by
the
united
plant
guard
workers
who
had
been
certified
by
the
board
and
that
there
was
an
outstanding
collective
bargaining
agreement
between
wackenhut
and
the
union
covering
those
employees.
although,
wackenhut
submitted
a
bid,
the
successful
bidder
was
burns.
in
the
next
moth,
june
of
1967,
wackenhut
or
burns
sought
to
employ
when
it
took
over
on
july
1
as
many
of
the
wackenhut
guards
as
possible
for
the
reason
that
they
had,
they
cleared
security
and
top
security
clearance
that
was
needed
for
this
type
of
work.
the
wackenhut
guards
applied
for
jobs
with
burns.
as
they
did
so,
burns’
officials
in
turn
assisted
the
american
federation
of
guards,
another
union
with
whom
wackenhut
had
a
contract
covering
its
employees
in
los
angeles
county.
that
contract
did
not
cover
these
employees
because
this
was
in
san
bernardino
county,
but
nonetheless,
burns
assisted
the
american
federation
of
guards
in
obtaining
membership
applications
from
the
wackenhut
guards
as
they
came
to
apply
for
jobs
with
burns.
representatives
of
burns
told
the
guards
that
they
could
not
get
uniforms
without
signing
american
federation
of
guards
membership
cards
and
that
they
had
to
join
the
american
federation
of
guards
in
order
to
work
for
burns.
on
june
29,
burns’s
branch
manager
concluding
that
a
majority
of
the
employees
to
be
used
that
the
lockheed
airport
job
had
signed
american
federation
of
guards
membership
applications
or
were
already
members
of
that
union
recognized
the
american
federation
of
guards
as
their
bargaining
representative.
wackenhut
had
terminated
its
guard
service
at
midnight
on
june
30
and
burns
began
to
furnish
such
service
on
july
1.
on
that
date,
burns'
lockheed
force
like
wackenhut’s
consisted
of
42
guards.
of
the
42,
27
or
more
than
a
majority
had
formally
been
employed
by
wackenhut
and
15
guards
were
transferred
from
other
burns’
jobs.
the
burns
guards
performed
essentially
the
same
tasks
at
the
same
stations
that
the
wackenhut
guards
had
performed.
moreover,
although
burns
used
its
own
supervisors,
their
functions
and
responsibilities
were
similar
to
those
of
their
wackenhut
predecessors,
both
utilize
area
supervisors
who
perform
similar
functions
and
both
had
full
time
supervisors
on
the
lockheed
job
with
similar
functions.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
believe
all
of
them.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
they
were
already
members.
they
were
apparently
transferred
from
the
los
angeles
county
and
thus
were
under
the
burns’
contract
with
the
american
federation
of
guards
which
i
believe
had
a
union
security
clause
as
did
the
united
plant
guards
contract
with
wackenhut.
on
july
12,
the
united
plant
guard
workers
requested
that
burns
recognize
it
as
the
bargaining
representative
of
the
burns
employees
at
lockheed
and
honor
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
it
had
with
wackenhut.
burns
refused
and
the
union
filed
unfair
labor
practice
charges
with
the
board.
the
board
found
that
the
--
that
burns
violated
section
8
(a)
(2)
and
(1)
of
the
act
which
prohibits
illegal
assistance
by
an
employer
to
a
labor
organization
by
assisting
the
american
federation
of
guards
in
organizing
and
by
recognizing
american
federation
of
guards
when
it
did
not
represent
an
un-coerced
majority
of
burns’
employees.
this
finding
was
sustained
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
it
is
not
an
issue
here.
the
board
also
found
that
a
bargaining
unit
limited
that
the
guards
working
at
the
lockheed
airport
facility
was
appropriate,
that
burns
continued
essentially
the
same
operation
at
that
plant
that
wackenhut
had,
and
therefore,
it
was
a
successor
employer
to
wackenhut
and
accordingly
the
board
held
that
burns
violated
section
8
(a)
(5)
and
(1)
of
the
act
by
refusing
to
recognize
and
bargain
with
the
united
plant
guards.
finally,
the
board
drawing
support
from
this
court’s
decision
in
wiley
against
livingston
which
i
will
get
to
later,
the
board
held
that
as
a
successor
to
wackenhut,
burns
was
obliged
to
honor
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
between
wackenhut
and
the
united
plant
guard
workers
and
that
by
refusing
to
do
that
that
was
an
additional
violation
of
the
bargaining
obligation.
the
court
of
appeals
in
an
opinion
by
judge
hayes
sustained
the
board’s
finding
as
i
indicated,
the
bear
legal
assistance,
sustained
the
board’s
finding
of
--
that
burns
was
a
successor,
sustained
the
finding
that
there
was
a
refusal
to
bargain
and
burns
refusing
to
recognize
united
plant
guard
workers
as
a
representative
of
the
employees,
but
held
that
the
board
had
exceeded
its
powers
under
the
statute
in
finding
that
there
was
also
a
further
refusal
to
bargain
in
failing
to
honor
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
both
the
successor
issue
and
the
propriety
of
the
board’s
finding
requiring
a
contract
to
be
honored
before
this
court
on
a
cross
petition
for
certiorari.
now,
as
this
court
knows
in
enacting
the
national
labor
relations
act,
congress
made
the
policy
declaration,
section
1
of
the
act
that
protection
by
law
of
the
right
of
employees
are
organized
and
bargained
collectively,
safeguards
commerce
from
interruption
by
removing
a
frequent
source
of
industrial
strike.
the
way
the
board
--
the
act
implements
that
policy
is
to
provide
a
procedure
whereby
the
board
can
conduct
a
secret
ballot
election
and
get
the
employees'
wishes
concerning
a
bargaining
representative.
if
a
majority
vote
for
them,
it
certifies
them
as
the
exclusive
bargaining
representative
under
section
8
(a)
(5)
of
the
act,
it
is
a
refusal
to
bargain,
to
refuse
to
honor
the
certification.
furthermore,
since
the
act
also
rests
on
the
premise
that
industrial
pieces
promoted
by
maintaining
stability
into
bargaining
relationship,
a
board
certification
is
normally
not
subject
to
challenge
for
one
year.
this
court
endorsed
the
board’s
rule
to
that
effect
in
the
brooks
case
or
longer,
if
there
is
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
of
reasonable
duration
and
under
court
principles
that
had
been
approved
by
the
courts
collective
bargaining
agreement
of
up
to
three
years
is
normally
regarded
as
reasonable
duration.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes
sir.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor
those
are
the
only
two
questions
as
i
understand
it.
now,
in
line
with
the
general
principles
that
i
have
just
outlined,
had
burns
remained
the
employer
here,
it
would
have
been
obliged
to
recognize
the
united
plant
guard
workers,
during
life
of
the
three-year
collective
bargaining
agreement,
notwithstanding
any
changes
in
the
complement
of
the
employees
that
occurred
during
the
life
of
that
agreement
and
if
wackenhut
had
repudiated
that
agreement
or
it
unilaterally
modified
its
wage
provisions
or
any
other
provision
relating
to
the
employees
terms
and
conditions
of
employment,
it
would
not
only
have
been
subject
to
a
suit
for
breach
of
the
agreement
under
section
301
of
the
labor
management
relations
act,
but
it
would
have
violated
section
8
(d)
and
therefore
8
(a)
(5)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
well
because
section
8
(d)
provides
in
relevant
part
that
where
there
is
in
effect
a
collective
bargaining
contract,
the
duty
to
bargain
collective
shall
mean
that
no
party
to
such
contract
shall
terminate
or
modify
such
contract
without
giving
prescribed
notice
and
waiting
until
the
expiration
date
of
such
contract.
and
as
i
understand
it,
nothing
in
this
court’s
recent
decision
in
pittsburgh
plate
glass
affects
this
general
principle
because
this
contract
almost
exclusively,
if
not
exclusively
dealt
with
mandatory
subjects
of
bargain.
now,
i
do
not
understand
that
burns
disagrees
with
what
i
have
just
been
setting
forth
as
the
obligation
that
would
have
been
imposed
on
wackenhut
nor
do
i
understand
that
there
is
any
disagreement
with
the
next
point
that
i
am
going
to
make.
namely
that
early
in
the
administration
of
the
act,
the
board
evolved
the
doctrine
and
it
has
been
uniformly
approved
by
the
court
of
appeals,
although
this
court
has
never
had
occasion
specifically
to
pass
on
it,
that
the
mere
transfer
of
operations
from
employer
to
another
does
not
distinguish
--
extinguish
the
obligation
of
bargain
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
such
claims
for
a
leave
substantially
in
fact
the
identity
of
the
employing
enterprise
then
the
duty
of
the
original
employer
to
recognize
and
bargain
with
an
incumbent
union
evolves
upon
the
new
employer
as
a
successor
employer.
the
rationale
for
the
doctrine
is
simply
this.
that
if
the
employing
enterprise
remains
intact,
continuation
of
a
bargaining
obligation
serves
the
policy
of
averting
industrial
strike
in
that
enterprise
no
less
than
that
--
by
imposing
that
obligation
upon
the
successor
employer
then
did
imposing
it
on
the
original
employer.
moreover,
where
you
have
maintained
the
employing
enterprise,
there
is
little
reason
to
believe
that
the
employees’
original
choice
of
a
bargaining
representative
would
have
been
altered
by
the
mere
change
in
employers.
the
point
at
which
the
difference
between
us
develops
is
what
are
the
criteria
for
determining
whether
you
have
a
successor
employer
for
purposes
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
that
also
gets
back
to
the
chief
justice’s
question.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes
you
have
your
honor
and
it
is
burns’
point
that
that
does
make
a
difference
as
that
distinguishes
--
that
distinction
should
be
drawn
between
this
kind
of
a
situation
in
one
where
you
have
a
more
conventional
transfer
of
assets
or
of
facilities.
we
submit
and
we
believe
that
the
cases
in
the
court
of
appeals
support
our
submission
that
so
long
as
the
new
employer
ends
up
with
substantially
the
same
bargaining
unit
or
industrial
community
as
it
sometimes
called,
he
is
a
successor
employer
for
purposes
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
whether
he
does
that
as
a
result
of
direct
dealing
with
the
prior
employer
or
he
does
it
through
dealing
with
a
third
party
as
was
done
in
this
case
because
the
important
thing
as
i
tried
to
indicate
the
important
rationale
for
writing
this
--
the
loss
of
the
successor
employer
on
the
bargaining
obligation
is
that
the
change
in
employer
has
not
made
a
significant
change
in
the
bargaining
unit
which
had
originally
selected
the
union
as
the
employees’
representative.
and
that
is
what
we
had
here
because
irrespective
of
how
burns
ended
up
with
the
contract
and
the
findings
of
the
board
as
sustained
by
the
court
of
appeals
you
had
a
situation
where,
i
am
quoting
from
the
court
of
appeals
appendix
189,
“both
burns
and
wackenhut
are
a
nationwide
organizations.
both
perform
the
identical
services
at
the
same
facility,
namely
providing
plant
protection
service
for
lockheed.
although
burns
used
its
own
supervisors,
their
functions
and
responsibilities
were
similar
to
those
performed
by
their
predecessors
and
finally
and
perhaps
most
significantly,
burns
commenced
performance
of
the
contract
with
27
former
wackenhut
employees
out
of
its
total
complement
of
42.
moreover,
as
shown
by
burns’
assistance
to
the
american
federation
of
plant
guards,
it
too
recognized
this
lockheed
operation
as
a
separate
operation,
as
a
separate
bargaining
unit.”
so
that,
we
submit
that
since
the
change
in
from
wackenhut
to
burns
that
is
substantially
intact,
the
employment
conditions
at
the
enterprise
that
is
involved
there,
namely
the
supplying
of
the
guard
services
to
lockheed
which
was
a
separate
unit,
the
board
properly
found
that
burns
is
a
successor
employer
to
wackenhut
and
which
brings
me
to
the
second
question
as
to
whether
burns
was
not
only
obligated
to
recognize
and
bargain
with
united
plant
guard
workers’
union
and
prohibited
from
making
any
unilateral
changes
in
existing
working
conditions
without
first
bargaining
with
the
union
and
whether
it
was
also
obliged
to
honor
the
contract.
now
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
probably
--
it
had
about
two-and-a-half
years
i
would
say.
it
was
entered
into
in
--
perhaps
even
more
than
two-and-a-half
years,
it
was
entered
into
in
april
29,
1967
and
burns
took
over
on
july
1,
1967.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
was
a
three-year
contract.
there
would
be
no
question
that
wackenhut
would
have
been
required
to
honor
the
contract
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
for
three-year
time.
mr.
norton
j.
come
as
i
recall
it,
it
was
not.
three-year
contracts
are
not
uncommon
in
collective
bargaining.
there
was
a
time
when
a
one-year
contract
was
the
rule,
then
it
went
to
two
years
and
now
three
years
as
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
is
very
standard.
now
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
after
the
new
agreement
had
been
signed
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
at
the
time
that
they
--
before
they
signed
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
would
like
to
respond
to
mr.
justice
brennan’s
question
and
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
at
the
luncheon
break,
justice
brennan
asked
whether
there
was
any
indication
that
bids
would
be
lead
at
the
time
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
was
entered
into.
so
far
as
the
record
shows
there
was
no
indication
other
than
the
fact
that
lockheed
contract
with
wackenhut
was
a
year
contract
that
was
subject
to
removal.
however,
for
the
last
five
years
wackenhut
had
been
retained
to
perform
the
guard
service
at
this
installation
and
from
all
that
appears
in
the
record
it
had
every
intention
of
remaining
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
the
record
does
not
show.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
record
does
not.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
refer
you
to
appendix
10.
mr.
norton
j.
come
in
which
the
board
says,
we
find
therefore
that
burns
is
bound
to
that
contract
as
if
it
were
a
signatory
thereto.
it's
failure
to
maintain
the
contract
in
effect
is
violative
of
sections
8
(d)
and
8
(a)
(5).
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
you
have
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
which
is
the
unfair
labor
practice,
8
(a)
(5)
mr.
norton
j.
come
which
says
that
it
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
to
fail
the
bargain
collectively.
now
8
(d)
defines
large
part
what
constitutes
a
failure
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes
your
honor.
now,
to
be
sure
wiley
only
compelled
arbitration,
however
the
considerations
upon
which
the
court
compelled
a
non-consenting
employer
to
the
contract
to
go
to
arbitration
under
that
contract
we
submit
are
precisely
the
same
considerations
that
justified
the
board
in
applying
the
same
principle
to
its
interpretation
of
8
(d).
the
court
relied
upon
the
fact
that
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
not
in
any
real
sense,
the
simple
product
of
a
consensual
relationship;
it
is
a
cold
governing,
an
industrial
community
that
is
negotiated
under
the
principles
and
requirements
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
it
binds
employees
who
did
not
even
consent
to
the
contract
or
weren't
even
employed
at
the
time
it
was
negotiating
and
may
not
even
be
a
member
of
the
union
which
negotiated
it,
but
albeit
a
member
of
the
bargaining
unit
if
the
union
has
to
represent.
more
importantly
the
court
relied
upon
the
fact
that
the
objective
of
national
labor
policy
requires
that
the
rightful
prerogatives
of
owners
independently
to
rearrange
their
businesses
and
even
eliminate
themselves
as
employers,
be
balanced
by
some
protection
to
employees
from
a
sudden
change
in
the
employment
relationship
because
the
employee
and
the
union
usually
does
not
have
a
say
in
these
transfer
negotiations
and
we
submit
that
that
is
a
fortiori
in
an
industry
like
the
service
industry
which
is
subject
to
its
rapid
turn
on.
finally
the
court
relied
upon
the
fact
that
industrial
strife
could
be
avoided
by
submitting
employees’
claims
to
arbitration
leave
it
--
rather
than
leaving
them
to
a
test
of
economic
powers.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
as
to
--
if
the
contract
is
applicable,
the
extent
to
which
he
has
to
abide
by
the
contract,
the
extent
to
which
he
can
make
changes
to
meet
his
situation
are
all
matters
that
he
is
free
to
bargain
with
the
union
about
and
failing
an
agreement
to
take
to
the
arbitration.
the
board’s
decision
here
far
from
being
in
derogation
of
arbitration,
permits
arbitration
to
work.
all
the
board
is
saying
here
is
that
if
you
are
a
successor
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
we
have
defined
it,
you
have
taken
over
willingly
this
employing
enterprise,
you
just
cannot
say
that
you
are
not
going
to
pay
any
attention
to
the
(voice
overlap)
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
he
may
be
free
at
the
decision
as
to
what
are
--
before
he
takes
over
the
business
as
to
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
they
might
have
although
they
were
not
subject
to
that
contract
originally,
but
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
at
the
time
that
he
took
over,
i
mean
before
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
they
were
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
there
were
27
--
there
were
42
members
of
the
wackenhut
workforce
when
wackenhut
shut
down.
burns
employed,
i
believe
it
was
27
of
those
members
of
the
workforce.
mr.
norton
j.
come
conceivably
they
would
have
had
grievance
under
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
they
were
--
that
they
would
have
but
at
that
point,
however
i
mean,
the
reason
i
am
hedging
is
that
they
were
discharged
by
wackenhut
and
their
contracts
of
employment
were
not
renewed
by
burns
(voice
overlap)
mr.
norton
j.
come
but
in
any
event
this
is
a
problem
for
the
arbitrator.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
your
honor.
in
formulating
the
principle
in
this
case
the
board
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
board
--
the
board
found
a
successorship
in
emerald
maintenance
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
did
not
bind
them
to
the
contract
because
in
burns
as
mr.
justice
stewart
indicated
earlier
the
board
had
a
caveat
in
there
for
unusual
circumstances
and
the
board
found
that
the
peculiarities
of
government
procurement
practice
coupled
with
wage
determinations
under
the
service
contract
act
created
a
situation
where
at
least
with
respect
to
certain
types
of
government
contracts,
there
was
not
the
flexibility
for
negotiation
that
was
present
in
the
typical
civilian
type
of
contract
which
is
what
we
have
here.
we
do
not
have
here
lockheed’s
government
contracts
involved
in
this
case.
now,
i
--
if
i
may
be
permitted
to
just
make
one
other
point.
wiley
also,
we
submit,
disposes
of
the
contention
that
what
the
board
is
doing
here
is
writing
a
contract
for
the
parties
because
the
court
in
wiley
specifically
pointed
out
at
this
case,
where
they
had
found
the
kind
of
continuity
that
you
had
in
wiley,
the
continuity
here
is
much
stronger
than
you
had
in
wiley.
the
court
said
this
case
cannot
readily
be
assimilated
to
the
category
of
those
in
which
there
is
no
contract
whatever
or
none
which
is
reasonably
related
to
the
parties
sought
to
be
obligated.
it
was
a
contract
and
interscience,
wiley’s
predecessor
was
party
to
it.
we
submit
that
is
precisely
the
situation
here
a
fortiori
in
view
of
the
substantial
identity
with
the
original
workforce.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
i
do
not
think
so.
mr.
norton
j.
come
but
the
the
grievance
does
not
mean
that
they
will
prevail.
i
mean,
if
there
were
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
this
is
a
question
that
the
arbitrator
would
have
to
determine
as
to
whether
or
not
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
but,
query
whether
it
would
not
be
cause
under
the
contract
for
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--
for
wackenhut
to
say
that
since
i
am
closing
down
my
operation,
i
am
terminating
you
as
of
5
o’clock
tomorrow.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
they
certainly
were
here
because
burns
voluntarily
took
over
a
majority
of
the
wackenhut
employees
for
reasons
that
were
of
advantage
to
its
own
operation
(voice

mr.
norton
j.
come
we
do
not
go
that
far.
we
do
not
think
that
you
have
to
go
that
far
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
would
not
say
that
it
has
to
be
a
majority.
i
think
it
has
a
substantial
number
as
to
be
enough
to
give
you
a
continuity
of
employment
conditions
in
the
bargaining
unit.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
am
not
prepared
to
go
that
far,
your
honor.
i
think
that
there
may
be
a
difference
for
purposes
of
compelling
arbitration
under
301
and
what
would
be
the
rule
for
purposes
of
establishing
a
bargaining
obligation
or
representation
status
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
court
in
wiley
was
very
careful
to
indicate
that
it
was
not
passing
on
the
question
as
to
whether
you
had
enough
there
to
impose
representation
status
on
the
union.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
has
been
a
pleasure.
