mr.
bakaly,
the
board’s
holding
on
unfair
labor
practice,
this
has
to
be
contract
point?
was
that
your
refusal
to
honor
the
contract
was
the
violation
with
8
(a)
(5)?
unknown
speaker
but,
well,
8
(a)
(5)
that
has
been
formed
by
8
(d)?
unknown
speaker
not
especially
on
8
(d)
but
just
8
(a)
(5)
derived
from
8
(d),
was
that
it?
unknown
speaker
both?
unknown
speaker
well,
did
you
make
any
argument
below
or
do
you
make
any
here
based
on
the
language
of
8
(d),
the
full
8
(d)
says
that
whether
is
in
effect,
the
collective
bargaining
contract
and
so
forth.
the
duty
to
bargain
collect
agreement
shall
also
mean
that
no
party
with
such
contract
shall
and
so
forth.
unknown
speaker
so
you
are
not
a
party?
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course
the
board’s
brief
say
that
[laughter
attempt]
their
holding
relied
principally
on
wiley
--
unknown
speaker
they
also
concluded
that
its
decision
effectuated
8
(d).
they
do
not
say,
we
do
not
agree,
we
can
see
that
they
relied
on
8
(d)
those
--
for
the
8
(a)
(5)
finding
it
necessary.
rather
(voice

unknown
speaker
but
in
any
event
you
do
--
unknown
speaker
you
have
to
be
a
party
to
the
contract?
unknown
speaker
but
the
board
could
have
abstained
for
the
arbitrator?
unknown
speaker
well,
even
if
the
board
was
right
in
saying
that
unfair
practice
or
might
be,
they
could
have
abstained
depending
on
the
provision?
unknown

what
is
the
rule?
unknown
speaker
why
would
it
not?
unknown

they
were
part

weren't
they?

agreements,
didn't
they?
unknown

mr.
come
i
suggest
that
your
position
means
that
they
have
to
take
over
all
of
them?
they
cannot
come
in
with
this
part.
they
