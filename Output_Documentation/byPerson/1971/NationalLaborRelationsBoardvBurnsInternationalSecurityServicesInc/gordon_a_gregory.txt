mr.
gordon
a.
gregory
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
chamber
of
commerce
in
its
amicus
brief
stated
and
i
quote,
“in
a
service
industry
such
as
the
providing
the
plant
protection
service,
generally
the
only
variable
in
which
productivity
of
efficiency
gains
can
be
made
is
labor.”
i
submit
your
honors
that
in
this
case
the
labor
gains
that
have
been
made,
have
been
made
at
the
sacrifice
of
rights
that
are
federally
protected
and
rights
which
this
court
sought
to
stabilize
and
its
wiley
decision.
in
my
view,
there
are
classic
facts
here
of
wackenhut
corporation
having
had
a
contract
for
guard
services
for
a
number
of
years
on
an
unorganized
basis.
the
guards
that
my
client
represents
organized
those
people.
they
were
certified
by
the
national
labor
relations
board.
they
entered
into
negotiations
for
their
first
contract
which
did
contain
the
successors
and
assigns
clause
and
without
at
least
the
control
or
participation
of
the
parties,
lockheed
elected
to
let
its
contract
with
wackenhut
up
for
bids.
following
the
premise
that
the
only
commodity
this
guard
agencies
have
is
labor,
burns
then
was
in
the
position
to
ignore
the
stability
created
by
the
bargaining
agreement
and
effectively
then
to
bid
on
the
basis
of
labor
only.
the
result
was
that
the
employees
lost
the
benefits
of
the
gains
they
had
made
through
the
collective
bargaining
process.
i
suggest
that
a
doctrine,
that
a
successor
employer
and
assuming
for
the
moment
burns
was
a
successor,
albeit
a
non-consenting
party
to
what
has
clearly
been
held
to
be
a
non-consensual
agreement
and
rather
a
public
obligation
does
not
do
violence
to
clear
concepts
of
federal
labor
law
policy
as
they
were
established
prior
to
the
time
of
the
burns’
decision
because
prior
that
time
in
a
successor
situation
it
was
held
that
the
successor
was
bound
to
recognize
and
bargain
with
the
incumbent
union.
it
was
held
that
the
successor
was
bound
to
recognize
existent
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
whether
or
not
those
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
were
established
by
a
bargaining
agreement
or
otherwise.
mr.
gordon
a.
gregory
well,
your
honor
if
i
understand
the
question,
i
had
understood
that
in
for
example
the
board’s
decision
in
maintenance,
the
physical
acquisition
of
assets
was
not
essential
to
a
finding
of
successorship
nor
was
privity
--
mr.
gordon
a.
gregory
not
in
the
maintenance
incorporated.
mr.
gordon
a.
gregory
in
annual
maintenance,
i
do
not
believe
there
was
privity
or
an
understanding
between
the
successor
or
predecessor
in
that
case.
mr.
gordon
a.
gregory
yes.
that
decision
was
subsequent
of
course
to
the
determination
in
burns,
i
believe
the
case
is
on
appeal
and
--
mr.
gordon
a.
gregory
no,
it
did
not
overrule
burns.
it
distinguished
i
think
your
honor
on
the
basis
of
“unusual
circumstances”
and
of
course,
i
personally
disagree
that
there
were
unusual
circumstances
to
warrant
a
departure
from
burns
and
hopefully
that
matter
will
be
appealed,
but
i
do
not
see
any
distinction
between
annual
maintenance
and
what
the
board
had
held
earlier
in
maintenance
incorporated
and
then
as
set
forth
in
burns
where
they
--
mr.
gordon
a.
gregory
well,
that
was
asserted
below
your
honor
and
rejected
--
mr.
gordon
a.
gregory
this
i
would
say
would
be
one
of
the
numerous
factors
to
determine
whether
or
not
initially
there
was
a
successorship
involved
and
whether
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
of
the
predecessor
bore
a
reasonable
relation
to
that
predecessor.
i
do
not
believe
that
that
is
not
the
case
before
the
court
because
here
you
had
a
completely
separate
facility
and
if
i
might
add
on
that
point,
first
wackenhut
and
the
plant
guards
negotiated
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
of
which
i
think
we
can
assume
was
tailored
to
the
needs
of
plant
protection
services
at
that
facility.
mr.
gordon
a.
gregory
yes.
the
record
shows
it
was
10
to
12
cents
lower
and
then
at
a
future
date
some
two
months
after
its
takeover
burns
did
raise
the
wages
to
the
level
of
its
predecessor
and
maintained
them
there
for
a
time
--
mr.
gordon
a.
gregory
yes
it
was.
it
was
higher
than
the
so-called
anterior
sub-office
that
they
would
rely
upon
as
being
the
more
appropriate
unit.
mr.
gordon
a.
gregory
had
they
been
lower,
the
employees
would
have
been
stuck
with
them,
they
had
negotiated
them
and
burns
could
then
pay
those
wages
at
that
particular
facility
if
in
fact
they
were
a
successor.
mr.
gordon
a.
gregory
perhaps
not,
your
honor,
but
a
companion
case
with
burns
was
the
(inaudible)
division
wherein
the
union
desired
not
to
be
bound
by
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
where
there
had
been
a
change
in
ownership
and
the
board
has
indicated
that
the
rule
set
forth
in
burns
would
apply
equally
to
unions
as
well
as
employers
and
i
submit
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
a.
gregory
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
a.
gregory
yes
it
has.
i
would
point
out
your
honor
that
that
involved
an
application
of
the
service
contract
act.
in
fact
i
submit
a
misunderstanding
of
what
that
act
involves
since
basically
it
is
a
minimum
wage
or
davis-bacon
act
for
service
industry
employees
working
under
government
contract
and
of
course
those
factors
were
not
present
in
the
burns
case.
indeed
we
had
two
sophisticated
well
established
giant
guard
agency
and
i
would
make
the
point
that
burns
not
only
had
advance
knowledge
but
with
the
sophistication
on
experience
was
in
a
position
to
adapt
to
the
situation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
was
present.
mr.
gordon
a.
gregory
mr.
chief
justice
in
my
opinion
it
is
standard.
it
has
been
a
form
of
boiler
plate.
i
think
we
have
placed
in
bargaining
agreements
although
until
wiley
at
least,
until
burns,
there
may
have
been
valid
whether
as
a
matter
of
law
it
would
bind
a
non-consenting
successor
or
assign.
more
ideally
in
our
bargaining
agreements
we
attempted
to
make
it
a
condition
of
sale
or
assignment
that
the
predecessor
would
see
that
the
successor
adopt
it,
but
realistically
and
in
terms
of
placing
this
court’s
wiley
decision
on
the
rationale
thereof
promoting
industrial
stability
through
arbitration
and
of
giving
employee
some
modicum
of
protection
against
changes
in
ownership,
i
submit
burns
is
in
harmony
with
that
doctrine
because
under
wiley
if
there
has
to
be
arbitration
for
the
successor
it
is
implicit
there
cannot
be
that
arbitration
unless
the
bargaining
agreement
survives.
mr.
gordon
a.
gregory
if
i
understand
the
question
your
honor,
burns
i
do
not
believe
would
be
any
worse
off
in
that
situation
unless
you
are
alluding
to
the
american
federation
of
guards
and
(voice
overlap)
mr.
gordon
a.
gregory
i
do
not
believe
they
would
your
honor.
the
client
i
represent
has
had
experience
with
burns
throughout
the
country
where
we
have
other
units
and
i
know
of
my
own
knowledge
that
burns
has
other
unions
besides
afg
and
upg-wa,
but
i
do
not
believe
that
potential
threat,
if
it
is,
can
destroy
the
fact
that
there
was
continuity
of
identity
of
an
employing
enterprise.
there
was
previously
an
appropriate
unit
certified
by
the
national
labor
relations
board.
moreover,
i
would
point
out
that
the
act
contains
adequate
machinery
for
dealing
with
jurisdictional
disputes
assuming
they
developed.
mr.
gordon
a.
gregory
yes
it
would
be
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
gordon
a.
gregory
well,
i
believe
that
was
the
situation
in
monroe-sander
for
example
decided
by
the
second
circuit
where
the
possible,
either
refusal
to
employ
or
transfer
to
the
--
a
new
location
or
to
the
successor
in
turn
might
be
either
an
unfair
labor
practice
or
as
i
understand
wiley,
a
breach
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
or
a
matter
of
subject
to
arbitration.
so
i
would
not
state
that
a
headcount
is
absolutely
essential
to
the
operation
of
the
successorship
concept.
and
may
i
conclude
by
indicating
that
in
a
situation
such
as
presented
here,
it
would
appear
to
me
a
certain
stability
is
created
not
only
for
the
employees
on
whose
behalf
i
argue
but
for
those
employers
who
operate
in
the
service
industry
area
which
is
highly
competitive
but
typified
generally
by
competition
based
on
labor
rates,
rates
of
people
who
generally
speaking
are
barely
above
the
minimums
to
begin
with.
so
i
would
submit
there
could
be
stability
for
the
employer.
moreover
sophisticated
parties
anymore
in
labor
relations
do
enter
into
voluntary
adjustments
to
adopt
to
such
proper
changes
as
it
may
take
place
with
a
change
in
ownership
and
finally
this
court
has
made
it
clear
in
wiley
that
the
arbitration
machinery
is
to
be
fostered
and
is
of
course
available
or
binding
upon
a
successor
to
correct
these
situations.
i
submit
that
burns
has
finally
placed
an
entire
national
labor
relations
act
in
harmony
with
the
federal
labor
policy
generally
which
is
to
promote
and
foster
bargaining
through
agreements
and
informal
arbitration
on
disputes.
mr.
gordon
a.
gregory
mr.
chief
justice

may
it
please
the
court.

if
i
understand
the
question
your
honor,
burns
i
do
not
believe
would
be
any
worse
off
in
that
situation
unless
you
are
alluding
to
the
american
federation
of
guards
and
(voice
overlap)
mr.
gordon
a.
gregory
i
do
not
believe
they
would
your
honor.
the
client
i
represent
has
had
experience
with
burns
throughout
the
country
where
we
have
other
units
and
i
know
of
my
own
knowledge
that
burns
has
other
unions
besides
afg
and
upg-wa,
but
i
do
not
believe
that
potential
threat,
if
it
is,
can
destroy
the
fact
that
there
was
continuity
of
identity
of
an
employing
enterprise.
there
was
previously
an
appropriate
unit
certified
by
the
national
labor
relations
board.
moreover,
i
would
point
out
that
the
act
contains
adequate
machinery
for
dealing
with
jurisdictional
disputes
assuming
they
developed.
mr.
gordon
a.
gregory
yes
it
would
be
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
gordon
a.
gregory
well,
i
believe
that
was
the
situation
in
monroe-sander
for
example
decided
by
the
second
circuit
where
the
possible,
either
refusal
to
employ
or
transfer
to
the
--
a
new
location
or
to
the
successor
in
turn
might
be
either
an
unfair
labor
practice
or
as
i
understand
wiley,
a
breach
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
or
a
matter
of
subject
to
arbitration.
so
i
would
not
state
that
a
headcount
is
absolutely
essential
to
the
operation
of
the
successorship
concept.
and
may
i
conclude
by
indicating
that
in
a
situation
such
as
presented
here,
it
would
appear
to
me
a
certain
stability
is
created
not
only
for
the
employees
on
whose
behalf
i
argue
but
for
those
employers
who
operate
in
the
service
industry
area
which
is
highly
competitive
but
typified
generally
by
competition
based
on
labor
rates,
rates
of
people
who
generally
speaking
are
barely
above
the
minimums
to
begin
with.
so
i
would
submit
there
could
be
stability
for
the
employer.
moreover
sophisticated
parties
anymore
in
labor
relations
do
enter
into
voluntary
adjustments
to
adopt
to
such
proper
changes
as
it
may
take
place
with
a
change
in
ownership
and
finally
this
court
has
made
it
clear
in
wiley
that
the
arbitration
machinery
is
to
be
fostered
and
is
of
course
available
or
binding
upon
a
successor
to
correct
these
situations.
i
submit
that
burns
has
finally
placed
an
entire
national
labor
relations
act
in
harmony
with
the
federal
labor
policy
generally
which
is
to
promote
and
foster
bargaining
through
agreements
and
informal
arbitration
on
disputes.
