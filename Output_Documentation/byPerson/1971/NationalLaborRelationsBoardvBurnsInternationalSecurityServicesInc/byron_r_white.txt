justice

r.
white
well,
not
in
the
service
situations.
you
have
it
mergers
and
purchases
of
assets,
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
there
was
a
deal
that
was
--
was
there
a
deal
there
between
the
predecessor
and
the
successor?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
in
the
government
contract
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
about
the
board
decisions
in
government
contract
cases
where
you
–
where
--
on
government
bids
one
person
replaces
another
and
the
successor
is
held
not
to
be
bound?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
did
not
overrule
any
prior
cases,
did
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
say
if
burns
had
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
another
union
that
gave
the
other
union
the
bargaining
rights
with
respect
to
any
of
its
installations
in
california
and
then
with
the
one
who
has
bid
with
lockheed?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
it
was
rejected,
but
let
us
assume
that
it
was
true.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
was
the
wage
scale
of
burns
actually
lower
than
wackenhut?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
was
that
wage
rate
higher
than
burns’
other
establishment?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
would
you
say
if
the
burns,
if
the
wage
rates
that
wackenhut
had
been
lower
than
the
burns
rate?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
not
--
what
you
--
do
you
suppose
--
i
suppose
the
union
would
have
objected
but
i
am
not
sure
the
employees
would
have
objected
if
they
had
been
included
in
the
burns’
bargaining
unit?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
gregory,
do
you
contest
the
decision
that
the
union
was
the
bargaining
agent?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
do
you
have
to
win
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
why
not,
if
it
is
a
--
if
the
union
is
a
bargaining
agent,
it
is
--
that
because
of
burns
was
a
successor?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
--
if
it
is
a
successor
how
can
we
say
that
the
--
that
burns
is
not
bound?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
the
--
by
becoming
a
successor,
the
employer
agreed?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
became
a
successor
voluntarily,
didn't
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
says
i
voluntarily
want
to
be
a
successor?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
he
was
obligated
to
bargain
with
(voice
overlap)?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
petitioned
for
a
cert
on
the
first
part?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
you
are
not
obligated
even
to
bargain?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
it
were
clear
in
events
that
it
refer
--
that
in
a
situation
like
--
is
that
in
a
transaction
like
burns
engaged
in
that
you
are
(a)
going
to
have
to
bargain
and
(b)
honor
collective
bargaining
contract
then
i
do
not
know
what
confusion
there
would
be?
burns
would
know
what
it
is
bidding
on.
it
is
just
that
there
would
not
be
of
much
flexibility
in
one
element
of
its
cause,
one
element
on
bid
as
they
thought
there
might
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
do
not
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
true.
but
that
have
--
that
might
be
a
--
that
is
really
no
difference
in
time
from
saying
that
you
have
to
recognize
and
bargain
with
one
union
at
one
place
and
one
at
the
other.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
requiring
you
to
bargain?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
that
the
board
indicated
that
you
could
--
that
it
would
be
a
wholly
different
case
if
you
would
decide
it
to
bring
it
on
--
bring
in
your
own
employees,
had
not
hired
any
of
the
wackenhut
employees?
justice
byron
r.
white
will
you
have
to
--
will
they
have
to
be
required
with
some
sort
of
possibility
to
be
almost
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
wiley,
if
the
arbitrator
had
ultimately
decides
that
the
successor
was
bound?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
act
does
not
prohibit
a
successor
from
being
bound
by
a
pair
of
contract
that
he
never
agreed
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
but
the
successor
was
bound
by
everything
in
the
contract
even
though
he
never
agreed
and
even
though
he
never
agreed
to
those?
justice
byron
r.
white
wiley;
just
what
it
speaks
is
a
compulsory
arbitration
as
was
holding
--
with
the
holding
contrary
to
the
act?
just
as
mr.
justice
brennan
says
it
is
because
presumably
the
party
was
bound
by
--
was
bound
to
arbitrate.
he
was
ordered
to
arbitrate
because
of
the
contract
provision.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
arguably
at
least
the
board
went
way
beyond
wiley
in
the
sense
that
it
ordered
you
to
comply
whatever
the
provision
in
the
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
any
provision
of
the
contract
that
you
refuse
to
comply
with
would
be
an
unfair
labor
practice?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
as
far
as
wiley,
wiley
said
you
are
bound
to
arbitrate,
but
we
do
not
know
whether
you
are
bound
by
any
other
provision
of
the
contract
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
going
back
to
the
successor
point,
the
duty
to
recognize
that
union
in
bargain,
was
it
--
it
might
have
existed,
the
wholly
independently
if
whether
you
are
successor?
justice
byron
r.
white
27
out
of
42
of
the
wackenhut
employees
were
already
represented
by
a
union
and
if
they
had
demanded
bargaining
without
even
saying
you
are
successor,
i
suppose
you
would
have
some
obligations
to
bargain?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
certainly
you
did
not
challenge
--
were
you
in
any
position
to
challenge
the
unit
at
that
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
the
board
had
a
--
there
had
not
been
a
certification?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
based
upon
a
unit
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
nevertheless
under
the
rule
you
could
not
challenge
that
unit?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
board
rule
against
you
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
have
to
challenge
that
ruling?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
we
are
going
on
the
assumption
here
anyway
that
the
unit
was
fixed
and
the
only
question
was
your
duty
to
bargain
with
a
union
that
previously
been
certified?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
does
not
the
board
have
to
rely
on
8
(d)
to
say
you
are
bound?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
cannot
rely
on
8
(a)
(5)?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
true,
but
here
the
board,
they
hold
you
guilty
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
in
that
respect
had
find
that
you
were
bound
to
the
contract
and
had
modified
it
without
bargaining?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
does
the
board
get
their
jurisdiction
to
enforce
labor
contracts?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
it
is
not
only
unfair
labor
practice
to
breach
it
automatically
to
breach
the
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
have
to
go
8
(a)
(5)
--
you
have
to
--
there
is
a
provision
where
is
it
that
says
you
cannot
modify
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
might
as
well
say
if
--
rather
than
to
say
it
is
a
strange
acquisition,
it
is
a
strange
competition?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
service
industry?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
prevail
then
the
employer
may
bargain
to
the
labor
practice?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
come.
i
take
it
that
your
position
means
that
the
employer,
the
successor,
he
is
bound
by
the
contract
and
hence
he
could
not
bring
in
his
own
employees
if
he
wanted
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
could
not
fire
the
existing
employees
because
there
is
no
cause
under
the
provision
of
the
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
your
answer
to
my
question
is
yes,
it
does
mean
that.
he
is
not
free
to
bring
in
his
own
employees
without
following
the
contract
provisions
with
respect
to
discharge?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
other
15
employees
of
wackenhut
that
he
did
not
employ,
if
they
had
wanted
to
be
employed
and
were
refused,
had
grievances
under
the
board
provision?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
were
they
not?
they
were
part
of
the
union.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
15
if
they
had
wanted
to
be
employed
and
were
refused?
justice
byron
r.
white
conceivably?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
means
there
is
still
employees
though,
mr.
come
until
they
are
fired
in
the
accordance
of
the
contract,
that
must
be
what
you
meant?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
are
employees
until
they
are
discharged
in
accordance
of
the
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree,
i
agree.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
not
in
the
service
situations.
you
have
it
mergers
and
purchases
of
assets,
right?
justice
byron

white
i
know,
but
there
was
a
deal
that
was

there
a

there
between

the

justice
byron
r.
white
what
about

contract
cases?
justice
byron

white
and
what
about
the

decisions
in

cases
where
you
–
where
--
on
government
bids
one
person
replaces
another
and
the

justice

white
well,
that
is
true,
but
here
the
board,
they
hold
you
guilty
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
in
that
respect
had
find
that
you
were
bound
to
the
contract
and
had
modified
it
without
bargaining?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
does
the
board
get
their
jurisdiction
to
enforce
labor
contracts?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice

it
is
not
only
unfair
labor
practice
to
breach
it
automatically
to
breach
the
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
have
to
go
8
(a)
(5)
--
you
have
to
--
there
is
a
provision
where
is
it
that
says
you
cannot
modify
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
might
as
well
say
if
--
rather
than
to
say
it
is
a
strange
acquisition,
it
is
a
strange
competition?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
service
industry?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
prevail
then
the
employer
may
bargain
to
the
labor
practice?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
come.
i
take
it
that
your
position
means
that
the
employer,
the
successor,
he
is
bound
by
the
contract
and
hence
he
could
not
bring
in
his
own
employees
if
he
wanted
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
could
not
fire
the
existing
employees
because
there
is
no
cause
under
the
provision
of
the
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
your
answer
to
my
question
is
yes,
it
does
mean
that.
he
is
not
free
to
bring
in
his
own
employees
without
following
the
contract
provisions
with
respect
to
discharge?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
other
15
employees
of
wackenhut
that
he
did
not
employ,
if
they
had
wanted
to
be
employed
and
were
refused,
had
grievances
under
the
board
provision?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice

were
they
not?
they
were
part
of
the
union.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
15
if
they
had
wanted
to
be
employed
and
were
refused?
justice
byron
r.
white
conceivably?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
means
there
is
still
employees
though,
mr.
come
until
they
are
fired
in
the
accordance
of
the
contract,
that
must
be
what
you
meant?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
are
employees
until
they
are
discharged
in
accordance
of
the
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree,
i
agree.
