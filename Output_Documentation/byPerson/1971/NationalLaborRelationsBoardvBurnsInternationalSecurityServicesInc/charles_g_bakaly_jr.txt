mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
court
has
zeroed
in
on
the
narrowness
of
this
case
with
respect
to
the
successorship
issue,
it
does
involve
service
industry
type
businesses
and
our
position
before
this
court
at
this
time
which
has
not
been
answered
by
the
court
below
or
by
counsel
is
that
this
facility
operation
of
either
burns
or
wackenhut
was
not
an
employing
industry
under
either
burns
or
wackenhut
and
therefore
there
could
not
be
any
continuity
of
the
employing
industry.
we
are
not
contesting
the
general
law
that
a
successorship
will
be
found
where
there
is
no
change
in
the
employing
industry.
we
are
dealing
with
a
particular
service
industry
and
what
this
facility
was
which
everybody
has
assumed
this
facility
operation
was
just
a
small
portion
of
wackenhut
business
in
california
and
it
was
a
very,
very
small
portion
of
burns’
business
in
california.
and
the
cases
unfortunately
have
not
dealt
with
this
question
of
what
is
an
employing
industry
in
the
service
industry
context
and
we
say
that
an
employing
industry
is
--
must
be
a
large
enough
portion
to
where
there
is
managerial
authority
and
skill
which
is
necessary
to
run
the
business
and
to
make
decision
on
matters
that
are
critical
to
employees
and
that
the
employing
industry
is
used
with
a
purpose
therefore
in
determining
the
employees
desires
about
having
a
union.
now,
as
to
the
regards
to
the
facts
in
this
case,
as
been
pointed
out
that
there
was
an
annual
renewal
contract
between
lockheed
and
wackenhut.
there
was
not
a
term
agreement
between
wackenhut
and
lockheed
and
that
the
contract
between
wackenhut
and
the
plant
guards
was
the
first
contract
so
that
the
successors
and
assigns
clause
had
not
been
in
any
previous
agreement.
now,
why
did
not
this
facility
have
the
indicia
of
an
employing
industry?
as
we
have
said
it
was
a
very,
very
small
portion
of
the
business
of
each.
there
is
only
one
supervisor
there,
part
time
when
wackenhut
had
it.
when
burns
took
it
over
there
was
one
supervisor
with
limited
authority,
limited
authority.
the
wages,
the
benefits,
the
working
conditions,
all
other
decisions
were
established
at
the
corporate
headquarters
not
at
the
facility.
with
respect
to
burns
it
was
established
on
the
anterior
basis.
there
were
separate
office
staffs.
there
was
no
office
staff
at
the
facility
of
burns.
there
was
no
payroll
and
accounting
staff.
all
that
was
handled
at
the
sub-office
where
burns
is
in
it,
the
california
office
for
wackenhut.
and
there
were
separate
manuals
and
procedures
of
these
two
competing
companies
of
which
this
facility
was
merely
a
very
small
portion.
in
any
event,
there
was
a
substantial
change
primarily
because
of
the
quickness
within
which
this
operation,
facility
was
integrated
in
the
burns
as
regular
operation
because
of
burns’
practice
of
interchanging
guards
regularly
to
have
the
flexibility,
to
have
the
particular
guard
work
at
more
than
one
location
where
his
services
could
be
best
utilized.
they
had
this
practice
and
within
six
months,
less
than
the
majority
of
the
former
wackenhut
employees
were
employed
at
the
facility,
so
that
immediately
upon
burns
taking
this
over,
integrated
it
into
its
other
unit.
from
a
policy
standpoint
as
the
chief
justice,
i
think
pointed
out,
there
would
be
serious
problems
if
this
rule
of
successorship
applied
in
the
service
industries
to
the
companies
like
burns
and
that
would
cause
a
lack
of
stability
in
labor
relations
and
this
kept
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
we
do,
upon
the
takeover,
yes.
we
do
not
believe
that
burns
was
a
successor
to
wackenhut,
and
therefore,
the
upgw
was
not
the
bargaining
representative.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
we
do
not
have
to
win
on
that
for
the
contract
question,
no.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
that
is
right.
that
would
be
the
only
basis
on
which
we
would
have
to
(voice
overlap)
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
because
mr.
justice
white,
section
8
(d)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
very
precisely
proscribed
certain
powers
to
the
labor
board.
the
labor
board,
the
national
labor
relations
does
not
have
the
power
to
compel
an
employer
to
become
a
party
to
an
agreement.
this
is
a
cardinal
principle
and
this
is
what
labor
board
has
done
here.
they
have
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
in
what
regard,
mr.
justice?
there
was
no
law
at
the
time
of
the
employer
begun
a
successor
that
he
(voice
overlap)
obligated
out
of
this
(voice
overlap)
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
that
is
correct.
he
bid
for
the
job
and
was
awarded
it
by
lockheed.
he
will
not
have
any
relationship
(voice
overlap)
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
alright,
but
the
law
for
35
years
to
that
time
was
that
a
successor
was
not
obligated
to
honor
the
agreement.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
to
bargain,
yes
sir.
that
has
been
the
law
for
35
years
until
the
board
in
this
case
for
the
first
time
since
1934
changed
that
rule.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
of
course
not.
could
–-
you
cannot
obligate
a
third
party
by
the
mere
successors
and
assigns
language.
now,
the
court
in
wiley
in
a
301
action
did
hold
for
the
purposes
of
arbitration
that
a
successor
was
obligated
to
arbitrate.
but
that
was
a
far
cry
from
a
holding
that
--
the
person
arbitrating
was
bound.
it
was
up
to
the
arbitrator
to
decide
the
portion
if
any
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
by
which
the
successor
was
obligated.
now
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice,
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
on
the
first
part,
on
the
successorship
part.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
that
is
correct
because
this
small
facility
operation
was
not
an
employing
industry
as
that
term
should
be
applied
in
order
to
have
stability.
think
what
happens
to
a
service
company
in
the
greater
los
angles
area
that
has
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
one
union
that
it
recognizes
that
union
for
los
angeles
county
and
they
are
competing
constantly
for
these
jobs.
now,
if
every
time
they
takeover
a
new
job
they
are
going
to
takeover
a
new
union
that
is
going
to
cause
serious
problems
of
instability.
it
is
going
to
cause
jurisdiction
strike
and
it
is
going
to
put
the
employer
in
the
middle
between
two
competing
unions.
now,
this
is
of
the
policy
reason
why
in
this
industry,
we
are
not
talking
about
successorship
generally,
but
in
this
service
industry
where
there
is
so
much
of
interchange
of
employees
and
the
changing
of
jobs
so
regular.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
well,
they
could
not
interchange
employees.
you
cannot
require
employees
to
join
two
or
three
different
unions
mr.
justice
white
and
require
them
to
pay
dues
in
these
unions
as
a
practical
matter.
so
you
could
not
interchange
employee
from
one
job
to
another
even
though
you
have
thought
that
in
order
to
do
it
and
have
efficiency
you
would
want
it
(voice
overlap)
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
well
because
if
over
here,
this
job
a,
you
have
union
x
and
over
at
job
b,
you
have
union
y
and
you
have
union
shop
agreements
with
both
of
them
and
require
a
union
membership
within
30
days.
you
could
not
transfer
an
employee
from
this
job
over
here
on
a
temporary
basis
without
requiring
anybody,
any
member
of
the
union.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
we
think
it
is
in
this
small,
narrow
area
of
service
industry
mr.
justice
and
that
is
why
i
am
not
--
we
are
not
trying
for
a
principle
of
law
here
that
will
stop
the
general
rule
of
successorship
and
the
obligation
to
bargain.
when
you
acquire
a
factory,
when
you
have
acquired
a
business,
there
is
growing
concern
with
an
office
staff
and
so
forth,
we
are
not
attempting
to
alter
any
general
rule.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
requiring
you
to
bargain
as
opposed
to
the
agreement.
i
will
get
to
the
agreement
because
that
is
a
matter
of
great
concern
in
this,
but
on
the
successorship
issue
we
are
not
trying
for
a
--
maybe
our
position
is
somewhat
different
from
the
amicus
in
this
regard
but
as
far
as
burns
is
concerned
we
are
trying
only
here
to
show
the
court
the
difference
between
a
service
industry
and
industries
generally
in
this
area
of
successorship.
we
are
not
trying
to
adopt
a
rule
of
successorship
different
from
the
present
rule
of
successorship
except
in
this
narrow
service
industry.
now
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
yes.
if
there
is
any
reason
why
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
well,
it
depends
on
the
collective
bargaining,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
no.
no,
employers
today
to
get
flexibility
would
obtain
provisions
and
they
avail
permitting
transfers
of
employees
in
order
to
have
this
opportunity
to
utilize
people
at
different
locations.
you
might
have
because
in
economics
you
might
bargain
that
away
in
a
particular
situation,
but
generally
speaking
employers
had
the
right
in
service
industries
to
transfer
people.
let
us
supposed,
if
why
and
here
is
why
you
have
to.
i
am
building
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
i
am
thinking
particularly
of
a
maintenance
contractor
and
the
guard
service
primarily.
take
a
building
that
has
a
maintenance
contractor
and
the
particular
employees
asserts
in
the
floor
gets
into
a
fight
with
the
tenant.
that
building
contractor,
the
owner
of
the
building
is
going
to
say
to
the
maintenance
company
move
that
fellow
out
of
there
and
the
maintenance
company
is
going
to
transfer
him
to
another
building
and
that
just
happens
all
the
time.
they
have
to
have
(voice
overlap)
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
no.
lockheed
would
discharge
the
employee
to
that
building.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
and
it
goes
through
the
grievance
procedure.
i
suggest
that
this
is
the
less
of
an
impact
on
employees
to
permit
the
maintenance
company
to
say,
we
know
joe
that
your
relationship
with
that
company
was
bad,
but
we
think
that
you
can
have
a
good
relationship
with
another
company
so
we
are
going
to
give
you
another
chance
rather
than
fight
and
fire
you.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
and
we
submit
that
there
is
a
difference
because
of
the
--
primarily
of
the
interchange
in
the
integration
and
the
fact
that
you
are
operating
at
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
different
locations
in
the
same
general
area
and
every
location
becomes
a
bargaining
unit.
there
is
going
to
be
great
instability
and
difficulty,
we
submit.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
well,
mr.
come
did
not
say
that
exactly.
he
said
that
that
would
be
a
factor
that
he
has
taken
to
consider
(voice
overlap)
in
a
different
case.
mr.
gregory
said
that
he
would
not
find
it
a
different
case
if
we
are
drawing
all
of
our
employees
and
in
fact
where
you
have
this
policy
of
integration
within
six
months,
mr.
justice
white,
there
was
a
majority
of
non-wackenhut
employees
there.
that
is
a
really
short
period
of
time
and
because
of
this
burns
policy
that
i
am
talking
about,
that
happened.
now,
just
because
it
did
not
happen
on
day
one,
to
tell
you
exactly
the
client
did
not
have
it
on
day
one
because
of
the
required
peculiar
requirements
for
security
clearances
at
lockheed.
burns
did
not
have
in
its
other
operations
enough
employees
that
had
the
top
secret
security
clearance
availed
and
that
kind
of
a
circumstance
is
the
only
reason
why
they
did
not
transfer
the
majority
of
their
guards
from
other
locations
which
is
their
normal
practice
when
they
take
over.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
yes.
i
would
like
to
go
assuming
which
obviously
we
do
not,
but
for
the
purposes
of
argument,
go
to
the
second
point
on
the
contract
issue
and
call
of
the
board’s
attention
that
the
long
line
of
authority
that
says
that
the
purpose
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
was
not
to
allow
governmental
regulations
of
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
this
court
in
h.
k.
porter
in
1970
held
that
in
chicago
northwestern
transportation
union,
the
same
principle,
the
statute,
the
legislative
history
all
say
that
the
labor
board
distinguished
perhaps
from
a
court,
does
not
have
the
power
to
order
somebody
to
make
a
concession
or
to
a
particular
proposal
or
to
the
entire
agreement,
we
submit.
and
that
it
is
this
section
of
8
(d)
which
controls
the
board
here
and
prohibits
what
the
board
has
done
in
this
case.
the
language
of
8
(d)
is
“but
such
obligation
does
not
compel
either
party
to
agree
to
a
proposal
or
require
the
making
of
a
concession.”
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
no
problem
with
that.
no
problem
to
that
at
all.
the
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
section
301
and
the
policy
created
by
this
court
that
it
favors
arbitration
as
the
method
of
resolving
these
disputes
is
not
circumscribed
by
section
8
(d).
301
and
8
(d)
are
which
regulates
the
board’s
power
are
separate
method
that
does
it.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
that
is
correct
and
that
we
feel
is
with
--
in
the
interest
of
following
the
policy
of
promoting
arbitration
and
using
arbitration
as
the
manner
in
the
means
of
resolving
these
disputes,
but
let
the
arbitrator
who
has
as
mr.
justice
douglas
has
said
that
the
person
who
has
most
competence
in
this
area,
who
has
the
knowledge
of
the
law
to
shop,
let
him
be
the
one
who
decide
that.
and
of
course
you
know
arbitrator
in
the
wiley
case
after
deciding
that
the
contract
was
bound
--
binding
for
a
couple
of
months
was
then
not
binding
thereafter.
as
justice
hayes
said
in
an
extremely
well
reasoned
opinion
that
h.
k.
porter
and
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
really
control
here.
we
would
like
to
call
this
court’s
attention
to
a
very
recent
case
decided
by
the
sixth
circuit
on
the
30th
of
december
in
nlrb,
the
interstate
65
corporation
which
does
not
have
cite
yet,
number
71-1198
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
agreed
with
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
finding
a
successorship
in
the
particular
facts
of
that
case
but
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
the
caption
of
the
case
is
national
labor
relations
board
versus
interstate
65
corporation,
dba
continental
inn,
before
judges
weick,
celebrezze
and
peck.
mr.
charles

mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
thirtieth,
number
71-1198
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
it
was
a
very
short
statement.
they
recognized
that
the
burns
case
is
pending
before
this
court.
they
say
we
agree
with
the
second
circuit’s
resolution
of
this
issue
in
burns.
that
court
decided
that
the
board
had
exceed
its
powers
in
ordering
a
successor
employer
to
honor
a
collective
bargaining
contract
that
had
not
been
a
party
to.
the
board
had
never
before
burns
has
found
such
requirement
to
exist
and
we
see
no
change
in
case
law
or
statutory
law
which
would
permit
the
board
to
suddenly
reverse
itself
on
this
question.
any
further
discussion
of
this
issue
is
unnecessary
in
light
of
the
supreme
court's
pending
decision
thereon.
we
simply
hold
that
in
our
view
the
second
circuit
determination
of
the
issue
was
correct
and
we
adhere
to
it.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
it
was
a
motel
--
it
was
a
motel
operation,
an
entire
motel
was
the
facts
of
that
case
and
on
the
successorship
they
found
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
yes.
they
reacquired
a
motel
and
made
some
changes,
but
the
court
agreed
with
the
board
on
that
case
on
the
successorship
and
the
facts
of
that
case
that
it
was
a
successor,
but
nevertheless
held
that
they
were
not
bound
to
the
predecessor's
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
the
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
they
may
well
justice
blackmun.
i
was
not
considering
them.
i
am
talking
about
the
independent
contractor,
maintenance
company,
guard
service
that
operates
in
most
buildings
and
in
a
lot
of
plants
now
throughout
the
nation.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
oh!
no.
my
contract
point
is
not
limited
to
the
service
industries
at
all.
we
do
not
believe
the
board
has
the
power
to
order
any
employer
to
be
bound
to
any
contract
at
all
and
i
should
point
out
that
of
course
as
the
brief
show
the
tenth
circuit
in
an
opinion
which
interestingly
enough
did
not
cite
the
second
circuit
opinion
or
wiley
supported
the
board
and
found
that
there
was
power
for
the
board
to
have
an
employer
honor
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
that
case
is
in
the
briefs
that
the
--
but
of
the
three
circuits
now,
that
the
two
have
decided
against
the
board’s
power
and
one
in
favor
of
it.
the
board’s
reliance
on
wiley
is
really,
really
misplaced.
it
was
not
implicit
in
wiley
that
the
agreement
was
binding
on
--
as
the
board
would
have
stayed
in
its
brief.
it
was
argued
by
the
amicus
afl-cio
that
that
ought
to
be
the
rule
but
the
court
did
not
hold.
they
held
it
was
up
to
the
arbitrator
to
decide
in
each
(voice
overlap).
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
they
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
to
the
extent
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
bound
to
arbitrators
not
to
–-
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
that
is
correct.
but
as
a
point,
as
the
court
--
to
a
critical
point,
whereas
the
court
points
out
what
they
are
doing
is
they
are
favoring
the
policy
of
settling
disputes
by
arbitration.
they
are
not
saying
that
the
labor
board
which
its
powers
are
set
forth
by
congress
has
the
power
to
do
this.
now,
i
set
this
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
well,
that
is
right.
but
the
point
that
i
am
making
though
is
that
we
are
not
here
now
where
a
court
has
ordered
the
employer
to
be
bound
by
the
agreement.
we
are
here
under
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
it
does
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
and
there
was
arbitration
request
that
burns
would
be
obligated
if
their
successor
would
be
obligated
to
arbitrate,
no
question
about
that.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
yes
sir,
because
of
the
policy
permitting
arbitration
and
the
resolving
of
disputes
and
because
that
congress
has
not
given
the
board
that
power.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
we
are
not
bound
by
the
contract,
we
are
not
bound
to
obey
the
board’s
order
that
we
honor
this
agreement.
now,
if
that
is
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
well,
i
--
if
i
said
that
mr.
justice
marshall
i
--
would
i
--
we
are
not
taking
a
position
assuming
that
we
are
a
successor
that
we
would
not
have
to
arbitrate.
we
would
have
to
arbitrate
if
that
--
and
we
would
have
to
arbitrate
to
the
extent
to
which
the
agreement
is
binding,
which
is
what
they
did
in
wiley.
i
would
like
to
point
that
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
only
if
the
arbitrator
would
so
order
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
it
was
not
an
nlrb
case
and
it
is
clear
that
the
principles
of
301
are
not
necessarily
applied
to
unfair
labor
practice
cases.
three
years
ago,
i
argued
before
this
court
in
strong
roofing
and
which
mr.
justice
white
wrote
the
opinion
against
us.
we
were
arguing
in
strong
roofing
that
the
labor
board
did
not
have
the
power
to
order
an
employer
to
pay
fringe
benefits.
that
this
was
a
subject
of
arbitration,
but
because
of
a
clear
as
mr.
justice
white
said
because
of
a
clear
provisions
of
section
10
(a)
and
10
(c)
of
the
act
giving
the
board
a
large
remedial
powers
and
in
that
case
the
doctrines
of
301
applied
to
courts,
did
not
apply
to
the
board
because
of
the
provisions
section
10
of
the
act
and
we
say
that
the
same
thing
applies
here.
though
the
rules
with
respect
to
section
301
do
not
apply
because
of
a
clear
intent
of
congress
in
8
(b)
not
to
permit
the
labor
board.
they
were
very
concerned
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
and
contempt,
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
that
is
correct
and
they
left
it
to
the
arbitrator
and
his
expertise
to
so
hold.
now,
the
board
really
is
overreaching
when
they
say
that
the
result
called
for
here
is
to
promote
industrial
peace
and
to
--
and
that
there
is
a
policy
of
maintaining
collective
bargaining
agreements.
the
policy
of
section
1
of
the
act
is
to
promote
collective
bargaining,
not
the
imposition
brought
on
consenting
parties
of
collective
bargaining
agreements
and
that
is
what
they
have
done
here
and
the
courts,
the
strife
argument
was
made
in
h.k.
porter.
it
was
there
a
flagrant
case
of
the
employer
of
bargaining
in
bad
faith
and
refusing
to
adduce,
check
off
provision
or
it
had
in
other
plants,
it
had
adduced
check
off
provision
and
just
did
not
want
to
have
one
here
in
that
plant,
and
no
other
legitimate
economic
reasons
whatsoever.
and
it
would
have
saved
economic
strife.
it
would
not
had
so
much
economic
strife
possibly
if
this
court
had
ordered
the
employer
to
be
bound,
to
adduce
to
check
of
provisions,
but
it
did
not.
there
would
be
industrial
peace
if
there
was
compulsory
arbitration
in
this
country
maybe.
although
in
some
european
countries
where
they
have
had
co-determination
and
government
intervention
they
have
had
national
strifes
if
anything
but
industrial
peace
but
maybe
it
would
but
that
is
not
what
congress
has
intended
here.
plant
closures
cause
industrial
strife
but
in
darlington
this
court
held
that
you
could
close
a
plant
for
union
activity
because
you
did
not
like
--
you
did
not
want
your
plant
organized
and
that
kind
of
industrial
strife
is
great.
so
under
free
collective
bargaining
which
is
what
we
have
at
this
time,
strife
and
strikes
are
sometimes
necessary
and
of
course
the
fact
that
you
have
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
does
not
mean
that
you
are
necessarily
going
to
be
free
from
strikes.
all
of
us
know
the
situations
where
employees
and
unions
have
struck
in
violation
of
collective
bargaining
agreements
and
refused
to
go
back
in
the
face
of
court
order.
(voice
overlap)
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
i
do
not
follow
that
mr.
justice.
i
do
not
know.
if
i
could
other
than
if
we
were
a
successor
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
well,
they
could
file
a
petition
and
there
could
have
been
an
election
if
either
one,
yes,
then
we
would
have
and
that
is
really
where
are
on
the
successorship
issue.
we
are
not
saying
that
there
is
not
a
way
for
these
employees
to
have
the
union.
we
are
just
saying
that
we
ought
to
have
an
election
as
the
way
rather
than
having
the
union
imposed
upon
the
employees
and
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
no.
we
were
not.
that
unit
had
been
agreed
to.
it
was
a
consent
unit.
it
was
not
the
board’s
determination
on
the
unit
it
was
the
consent
your
honor.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
there
was
a
certification
based
upon
the
consent
agreement.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
but
the
parties,
not
the
labor
board
agreed
to
the
unit.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
yes.
we
think
we
could
challenge
that
unit,
yes
sir,
and
we
so
argued
below
that
we
could
challenge
that
unit.
the
certification
here
is
not
all
encompassing
that.
they
are
unusual
circumstances
and
we
think
that
in
this
case
this
change
of
ownership,
the
integration
etcetera
would
be
a
(voice
overlap)
unusual
circumstances
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
i
believe
so.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
yes.
but
we
are
not
contending
that
the
appropriate
unit
and
the
employing
industry
are
the
same
thing
at
all.
we
are
saying
that
those
are
two
different
concepts
and
we
did
contest
the
unit
and
we
did
not
raise
it
specifically
unless
it
is
raised
in
out
question
number
one,
in
our
certification
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
i
think
both
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
both
were
alleged,
yes.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
that
is
--
we
make
that
point
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
we
are
not
a
party
to
the
agreement
and
the
--
congress
was
clear
with
the
language
of
party.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
they
are
relying
on
8
(d).
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
8
(d).
no,
because
8
(d)
defines
8
(a)
(5).
8
(d)
is
the
section
that
tells
what
8
(a)
(5)
and
means
and
so
8
(a)
(5)
just
says
refuse
to
bargain
in
good
faith
then
8
(d)
says
what
that
means
so
they
go
together.
you
cannot
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
that
is
right.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
well,
i
do
not
--
i
do
not
see
how
they
can
separate
the
two
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
in
any
event
we
rely
on
8
(d)
as
a
proscription
on
the
board’s
power
on
unfair
labor
practice
cases
to
require
somebody
to
be
obligated
to
an
agreement.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
you
have
to
be
a
party.
the
board
has
no
power
to
order
it
to,
you
should
be
a
party.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
they
could
--
they
do
not
like
to
go
to
the
last
part.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
if
we
are
a
successor
then
if
we
have
unilaterally
modified
the
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
well,
that
is
a
good
question.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
that
is
right.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
modify,
that
is
8
(d)
and
that
is
the
provision
that
the
board
relies
on
to
find
a
violation
of
8
(a)
(5)
for
a
unilateral
modification.
this
court
as
you
point
out
has
never
so
ruled
on
that
point.
in
strong
roofing
there
is
some
dicta
that
would
indicate
in
that
direction
but
this
court
and
not
all
courts
ruled
on
that
question
and
the
board
in
its
most
recent
prior
case
as
while
not
exceeding
that
it
does
not
have
a
power,
it
now
says
that
it
is
going
to
defer
questions
of
modification
to
arbitration,
a
position
that
many
of
those
had
been
urging
the
board
for
sometime,
this
most
recent
prior
case
and
the
case
indicates
that
that
is
the
direction
the
board's
going
to
go
at
this
time.
now,
the
purposes
of
the
act
will
be
effectuated
by
assuming
a
successorship
by
requiring
good
faith
bargaining
and
the
arbitration
that
wiley
permits.
we
are
not
asking
the
court
to
back
away
at
all
on
the
wiley
case.
arbitrator,
the
arbitrator
is
more
qualified
and
desirable
and
quicker
to
interpret
these
matters
than
the
labor
board
and
we
submit
that
the
board’s
rule
of
imposing
collective
bargaining
agreements
will
cause
serious
inequities
upon
the
parties
as
judge
hayes
pointed
out,
counsel
alluded
to
the
duro
rule
as
judge
hayes
pointed
out,
it
would
be
very
unfair
to
a
labor
union
that
made
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
failing
company,
let
us
say
for
three
years
on
very
favorable
terms
to
then
have
that
company
acquired
by
certain
--
some
large
company
that
is
not
at
all
failing
and
be
obligated
to
that
agreement
for
two-and-a-half
to
three
years.
this
would
be
a
serious
inequity
as
judge
hayes
pointed
out
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
through
section
301
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
yes
sir.
no
question
about
that.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
i
do
not
follow
that.
[laughter]
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
yes.
they
could
have
deferred
arbitration
and
that
is
what
they
have
now
done
in
(inaudible),
that
is
what
they
have
done.
the
board’s
rule
really
also
from
a
policy
standpoint
in
our
view
would
really
unduly
restrain
competition
in
this
area.
the
board
points
this
out
in
emerald
maintenance
and
they
point
out
that
there
it
is
under
a
service
contract
act,
but
there
is
a
policy
permitting
a
government
contractor
to
bid
lockheed
as
a
99%
government
contractor.
while
it
is
true
that
this
contract
with
burns
was
not
out
of
the
service
contract
act
yet
the
same
policy
applies
with
saving
the
government
money
which
is
really
what
the
air
force
argued
in
emerald
maintenance
that
a
policy
of
contract
honoring
would
cause
the
government
because
of
its
inability
to
have
lower
bids
that
same
principle
would
apply
here.
also
often
times
the
alternative
for
a
company
that
is
in
the
place
of
being
acquired
is
to
go
out
of
business,
if
it
cannot
be
acquired.
now,
we
submit
that
this
rule
of
contract
honoring,
requiring,
imposing
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
going
to
be
a
deterrent
to
acquisitions
because
an
employer
that
comes
in
and
wants
to
buy
a
company
is
a
successor.
he
has
no
--
he
does
not
mind
about
bargaining
with
the
union
but
he
wants
to
try
that
to
get
some
changes
in
that
collective
bargaining
agreement.
it
may
well
be
that
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
has
caused
the
company
to
be
in
the
position
it
is
in.
now,
if
this
is
prevented,
we
are
going
to
have
a
lot
more
industrial
strike
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
yes
sir,
it
does.
and
i
have
just
said
that.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
in
the
service
industry
and
in
any
industry.
in
any
industry
it
would
have
that
effect
if
the
contract
is
because
no
one
could
come
in
and
bid
any
and
particularly
would
it
be
so
in
these
industries
where
the
big
bulk
of
the
price
is
the
cost
of
the
service.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
he
could
bargain,
he
--
we
--
if
we
are
a
successor
we
would
bargain
with
the
union
and
it
may
depending
upon
economic
power,
may
have
--
get
a
better
economic
arrangement
or
not.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
and
this
is
the
system
that
we
have
been
under.
we
submit
that
burns
is
not
a
successor
because
of
the
peculiar
industry
involved
here
and
that
in
any
event
assuming
that
burns
is
a
successor
that
the
board
has
no
power
to
impose
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
court
has
zeroed
in
on
the
narrowness
of
this
case
with
respect
to
the
successorship
issue,
it
does
involve
service
industry
type
businesses
and
our
position
before
this
court
at
this
time
which
has
not
been
answered
by
the
court
below
or
by
counsel
is
that
this
facility
operation
of
either
burns
or
wackenhut
was
not
an
employing
industry
under
either
burns
or
wackenhut
and
therefore
there
could
not
be
any
continuity
of
the
employing
industry.
we
are
not
contesting
the
general
law
that
a
successorship
will
be
found
where
there
is
no
change
in
the
employing
industry.
we
are
dealing
with
a
particular
service
industry
and
what
this
facility
was
which
everybody
has
assumed
this
facility
operation
was
just
a
small
portion
of
wackenhut
business
in
california
and
it
was
a
very,
very
small
portion
of
burns’
business
in
california.
and
the
cases
unfortunately
have
not
dealt
with
this
question
of
what
is
an
employing
industry
in
the
service
industry
context
and
we
say
that
an
employing
industry
is
--
must
be
a
large
enough
portion
to
where
there
is
managerial
authority
and
skill
which
is
necessary
to
run
the
business
and
to
make
decision
on
matters
that
are
critical
to
employees
and
that
the
employing
industry
is
used
with
a
purpose
therefore
in
determining
the
employees
desires
about
having
a
union.
now,
as
to
the
regards
to
the
facts
in
this
case,
as
been
pointed
out
that
there
was
an
annual
renewal
contract
between
lockheed
and
wackenhut.
there
was
not
a
term
agreement
between
wackenhut
and
lockheed
and
that
the
contract
between
wackenhut
and
the
plant
guards
was
the
first
contract
so
that
the
successors
and
assigns
clause
had
not
been
in
any
previous
agreement.
now,
why
did
not
this
facility
have
the
indicia
of
an
employing
industry?
as
we
have
said
it
was
a
very,
very
small
portion
of
the
business
of
each.
there
is
only
one
supervisor
there,
part
time
when
wackenhut
had
it.
when
burns
took
it
over
there
was
one
supervisor
with
limited
authority,
limited
authority.
the
wages,
the
benefits,
the
working
conditions,
all
other
decisions
were
established
at
the
corporate
headquarters
not
at
the
facility.
with
respect
to
burns
it
was
established
on
the
anterior
basis.
there
were
separate
office
staffs.
there
was
no
office
staff
at
the
facility
of
burns.
there
was
no
payroll
and
accounting
staff.
all
that
was
handled
at
the
sub-office
where
burns
is
in
it,
the
california
office
for
wackenhut.
and
there
were
separate
manuals
and
procedures
of
these
two
competing
companies
of
which
this
facility
was
merely
a
very
small
portion.
in
any
event,
there
was
a
substantial
change
primarily
because
of
the
quickness
within
which
this
operation,
facility
was
integrated
in
the
burns
as
regular
operation
because
of
burns’
practice
of
interchanging
guards
regularly
to
have
the
flexibility,
to
have
the
particular
guard
work
at
more
than
one
location
where
his
services
could
be
best
utilized.
they
had
this
practice
and
within
six
months,
less
than
the
majority
of
the
former
wackenhut
employees
were
employed
at
the
facility,
so
that
immediately
upon
burns
taking
this
over,
integrated
it
into
its
other
unit.
from
a
policy
standpoint
as
the
chief
justice,
i
think
pointed
out,
there
would
be
serious
problems
if
this
rule
of
successorship
applied
in
the
service
industries
to
the
companies
like
burns
and
that
would
cause
a
lack
of
stability
in
labor
relations
and
this
kept
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
we
do,
upon
the
takeover,
yes.
we
do
not
believe
that
burns
was
a
successor
to
wackenhut,
and
therefore,
the
upgw
was
not
the
bargaining
representative.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
we
do
not
have
to
win
on
that
for
the
contract
question,
no.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
that
is
right.
that
would
be
the
only
basis
on
which
we
would
have
to
(voice
overlap)
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
because
mr.
justice
white,
section
8
(d)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
very
precisely
proscribed
certain
powers
to
the
labor
board.
the
labor
board,
the
national
labor
relations
does
not
have
the
power
to
compel
an
employer
to
become
a
party
to
an
agreement.
this
is
a
cardinal
principle
and
this
is
what
labor
board
has
done
here.
they
have
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
in
what
regard,
mr.
justice?
there
was
no
law
at
the
time
of
the
employer
begun
a
successor
that
he
(voice
overlap)
obligated
out
of
this
(voice
overlap)
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
that
is
correct.
he
bid
for
the
job
and
was
awarded
it
by
lockheed.
he
will
not
have
any
relationship
(voice
overlap)
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
alright,
but
the
law
for
35
years
to
that
time
was
that
a
successor
was
not
obligated
to
honor
the
agreement.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
to
bargain,
yes
sir.
that
has
been
the
law
for
35
years
until
the
board
in
this
case
for
the
first
time
since
1934
changed
that
rule.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
of
course
not.
could
–-
you
cannot
obligate
a
third
party
by
the
mere
successors
and
assigns
language.
now,
the
court
in
wiley
in
a
301
action
did
hold
for
the
purposes
of
arbitration
that
a
successor
was
obligated
to
arbitrate.
but
that
was
a
far
cry
from
a
holding
that
--
the
person
arbitrating
was
bound.
it
was
up
to
the
arbitrator
to
decide
the
portion
if
any
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
by
which
the
successor
was
obligated.
now
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice,
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
on
the
first
part,
on
the
successorship
part.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
that
is
correct
because
this
small
facility
operation
was
not
an
employing
industry
as
that
term
should
be
applied
in
order
to
have
stability.
think
what
happens
to
a
service
company
in
the
greater
los
angles
area
that
has
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
one
union
that
it
recognizes
that
union
for
los
angeles
county
and
they
are
competing
constantly
for
these
jobs.
now,
if
every
time
they
takeover
a
new
job
they
are
going
to
takeover
a
new
union
that
is
going
to
cause
serious
problems
of
instability.
it
is
going
to
cause
jurisdiction
strike
and
it
is
going
to
put
the
employer
in
the
middle
between
two
competing
unions.
now,
this
is
of
the
policy
reason
why
in
this
industry,
we
are
not
talking
about
successorship
generally,
but
in
this
service
industry
where
there
is
so
much
of
interchange
of
employees
and
the
changing
of
jobs
so
regular.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
well,
they
could
not
interchange
employees.
you
cannot
require
employees
to
join
two
or
three
different
unions
mr.
justice
white
and
require
them
to
pay
dues
in
these
unions
as
a
practical
matter.
so
you
could
not
interchange
employee
from
one
job
to
another
even
though
you
have
thought
that
in
order
to
do
it
and
have
efficiency
you
would
want
it
(voice
overlap)
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
well
because
if
over
here,
this
job
a,
you
have
union
x
and
over
at
job
b,
you
have
union
y
and
you
have
union
shop
agreements
with
both
of
them
and
require
a
union
membership
within
30
days.
you
could
not
transfer
an
employee
from
this
job
over
here
on
a
temporary
basis
without
requiring
anybody,
any
member
of
the
union.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
we
think
it
is
in
this
small,
narrow
area
of
service
industry
mr.
justice
and
that
is
why
i
am
not
--
we
are
not
trying
for
a
principle
of
law
here
that
will
stop
the
general
rule
of
successorship
and
the
obligation
to
bargain.
when
you
acquire
a
factory,
when
you
have
acquired
a
business,
there
is
growing
concern
with
an
office
staff
and
so
forth,
we
are
not
attempting
to
alter
any
general
rule.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
requiring
you
to
bargain
as
opposed
to
the
agreement.
i
will
get
to
the
agreement
because
that
is
a
matter
of
great
concern
in
this,
but
on
the
successorship
issue
we
are
not
trying
for
a
--
maybe
our
position
is
somewhat
different
from
the
amicus
in
this
regard
but
as
far
as
burns
is
concerned
we
are
trying
only
here
to
show
the
court
the
difference
between
a
service
industry
and
industries
generally
in
this
area
of
successorship.
we
are
not
trying
to
adopt
a
rule
of
successorship
different
from
the
present
rule
of
successorship
except
in
this
narrow
service
industry.
now
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
yes.
if
there
is
any
reason
why
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
well,
it
depends
on
the
collective
bargaining,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
no.
no,
employers
today
to
get
flexibility
would
obtain
provisions
and
they
avail
permitting
transfers
of
employees
in
order
to
have
this
opportunity
to
utilize
people
at
different
locations.
you
might
have
because
in
economics
you
might
bargain
that
away
in
a
particular
situation,
but
generally
speaking
employers
had
the
right
in
service
industries
to
transfer
people.
let
us
supposed,
if
why
and
here
is
why
you
have
to.
i
am
building
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
i
am
thinking
particularly
of
a
maintenance
contractor
and
the
guard
service
primarily.
take
a
building
that
has
a
maintenance
contractor
and
the
particular
employees
asserts
in
the
floor
gets
into
a
fight
with
the
tenant.
that
building
contractor,
the
owner
of
the
building
is
going
to
say
to
the
maintenance
company
move
that
fellow
out
of
there
and
the
maintenance
company
is
going
to
transfer
him
to
another
building
and
that
just
happens
all
the
time.
they
have
to
have
(voice
overlap)
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
no.
lockheed
would
discharge
the
employee
to
that
building.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
and
it
goes
through
the
grievance
procedure.
i
suggest
that
this
is
the
less
of
an
impact
on
employees
to
permit
the
maintenance
company
to
say,
we
know
joe
that
your
relationship
with
that
company
was
bad,
but
we
think
that
you
can
have
a
good
relationship
with
another
company
so
we
are
going
to
give
you
another
chance
rather
than
fight
and
fire
you.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
and
we
submit
that
there
is
a
difference
because
of
the
--
primarily
of
the
interchange
in
the
integration
and
the
fact
that
you
are
operating
at
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
different
locations
in
the
same
general
area
and
every
location
becomes
a
bargaining
unit.
there
is
going
to
be
great
instability
and
difficulty,
we
submit.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
well,
mr.
come
did
not
say
that
exactly.
he
said
that
that
would
be
a
factor
that
he
has
taken
to
consider
(voice
overlap)
in
a
different
case.
mr.
gregory
said
that
he
would
not
find
it
a
different
case
if
we
are
drawing
all
of
our
employees
and
in
fact
where
you
have
this
policy
of
integration
within
six
months,
mr.
justice
white,
there
was
a
majority
of
non-wackenhut
employees
there.
that
is
a
really
short
period
of
time
and
because
of
this
burns
policy
that
i
am
talking
about,
that
happened.
now,
just
because
it
did
not
happen
on
day
one,
to
tell
you
exactly
the
client
did
not
have
it
on
day
one
because
of
the
required
peculiar
requirements
for
security
clearances
at
lockheed.
burns
did
not
have
in
its
other
operations
enough
employees
that
had
the
top
secret
security
clearance
availed
and
that
kind
of
a
circumstance
is
the
only
reason
why
they
did
not
transfer
the
majority
of
their
guards
from
other
locations
which
is
their
normal
practice
when
they
take
over.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
yes.
i
would
like
to
go
assuming
which
obviously
we
do
not,
but
for
the
purposes
of
argument,
go
to
the
second
point
on
the
contract
issue
and
call
of
the
board’s
attention
that
the
long
line
of
authority
that
says
that
the
purpose
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
was
not
to
allow
governmental
regulations
of
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
this
court
in
h.
k.
porter
in
1970
held
that
in
chicago
northwestern
transportation
union,
the
same
principle,
the
statute,
the
legislative
history
all
say
that
the
labor
board
distinguished
perhaps
from
a
court,
does
not
have
the
power
to
order
somebody
to
make
a
concession
or
to
a
particular
proposal
or
to
the
entire
agreement,
we
submit.
and
that
it
is
this
section
of
8
(d)
which
controls
the
board
here
and
prohibits
what
the
board
has
done
in
this
case.
the
language
of
8
(d)
is
“but
such
obligation
does
not
compel
either
party
to
agree
to
a
proposal
or
require
the
making
of
a
concession.”
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
no
problem
with
that.
no
problem
to
that
at
all.
the
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
section
301
and
the
policy
created
by
this
court
that
it
favors
arbitration
as
the
method
of
resolving
these
disputes
is
not
circumscribed
by
section
8
(d).
301
and
8
(d)
are
which
regulates
the
board’s
power
are
separate
method
that
does
it.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
that
is
correct
and
that
we
feel
is
with
--
in
the
interest
of
following
the
policy
of
promoting
arbitration
and
using
arbitration
as
the
manner
in
the
means
of
resolving
these
disputes,
but
let
the
arbitrator
who
has
as
mr.
justice
douglas
has
said
that
the
person
who
has
most
competence
in
this
area,
who
has
the
knowledge
of
the
law
to
shop,
let
him
be
the
one
who
decide
that.
and
of
course
you
know
arbitrator
in
the
wiley
case
after
deciding
that
the
contract
was
bound
--
binding
for
a
couple
of
months
was
then
not
binding
thereafter.
as
justice
hayes
said
in
an
extremely
well
reasoned
opinion
that
h.
k.
porter
and
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
really
control
here.
we
would
like
to
call
this
court’s
attention
to
a
very
recent
case
decided
by
the
sixth
circuit
on
the
30th
of
december
in
nlrb,
the
interstate
65
corporation
which
does
not
have
cite
yet,
number
71-1198
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
agreed
with
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
finding
a
successorship
in
the
particular
facts
of
that
case
but
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
the
caption
of
the
case
is
national
labor

board
versus
interstate

thirtieth,
number

in
the
court
of

for
the
sixth

it
was
a
very
short
statement.
they
recognized
that
the
burns
case
is
pending
before
this
court.
they
say
we
agree
with
the
second
circuit’s
resolution
of
this
issue
in
burns.
that
court
decided
that
the
board
had
exceed
its
powers
in
ordering
a
successor
employer
to
honor
a
collective
bargaining
contract
that
had
not
been
a
party
to.
the
board
had
never
before
burns
has
found
such
requirement
to
exist
and
we
see
no
change
in
case
law
or
statutory
law
which
would
permit
the
board
to
suddenly
reverse
itself
on
this
question.
any
further
discussion
of
this
issue
is
unnecessary
in
light
of
the
supreme
court's
pending
decision
thereon.
we
simply
hold
that
in
our
view
the
second
circuit
determination
of
the
issue
was
correct
and
we
adhere
to
it.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
it
was
a
motel
--
it
was
a
motel
operation,
an
entire
motel
was
the
facts
of
that
case
and
on
the
successorship
they
found
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
yes.
they
reacquired
a
motel
and
made
some
changes,
but
the
court
agreed
with
the
board
on
that
case
on
the
successorship
and
the
facts
of
that
case
that
it
was
a
successor,
but
nevertheless
held
that
they
were
not
bound
to
the
predecessor's
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
the
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
they
may
well
justice
blackmun.
i
was
not
considering
them.
i
am
talking
about
the
independent
contractor,
maintenance
company,
guard
service
that
operates
in
most
buildings
and
in
a
lot
of
plants
now
throughout
the
nation.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
oh!
no.
my
contract
point
is
not
limited
to
the
service
industries
at
all.
we
do
not
believe
the
board
has
the
power
to
order
any
employer
to
be
bound
to
any
contract
at
all
and
i
should
point
out
that
of
course
as
the
brief
show
the
tenth
circuit
in
an
opinion
which
interestingly
enough
did
not
cite
the
second
circuit
opinion
or
wiley
supported
the
board
and
found
that
there
was
power
for
the
board
to
have
an
employer
honor
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
that
case
is
in
the
briefs
that
the
--
but
of
the
three
circuits
now,
that
the
two
have
decided
against
the
board’s
power
and
one
in
favor
of
it.
the
board’s
reliance
on
wiley
is
really,
really
misplaced.
it
was
not
implicit
in
wiley
that
the
agreement
was
binding
on
--
as
the
board
would
have
stayed
in
its
brief.
it
was
argued
by
the
amicus
afl-cio
that
that
ought
to
be
the
rule
but
the
court
did
not
hold.
they
held
it
was
up
to
the
arbitrator
to
decide
in
each
(voice
overlap).
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
they
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
to
the
extent
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
bound
to
arbitrators
not
to
–-
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
that
is
correct.
but
as
a
point,
as
the
court
--
to
a
critical
point,
whereas
the
court
points
out
what
they
are
doing
is
they
are
favoring
the
policy
of
settling
disputes
by
arbitration.
they
are
not
saying
that
the
labor
board
which
its
powers
are
set
forth
by
congress
has
the
power
to
do
this.
now,
i
set
this
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
well,
that
is
right.
but
the
point
that
i
am
making
though
is
that
we
are
not
here
now
where
a
court
has
ordered
the
employer
to
be
bound
by
the
agreement.
we
are
here
under
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
it
does
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
and
there
was
arbitration
request
that
burns
would
be
obligated
if
their
successor
would
be
obligated
to
arbitrate,
no
question
about
that.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
yes
sir,
because
of
the
policy
permitting
arbitration
and
the
resolving
of
disputes
and
because
that
congress
has
not
given
the
board
that
power.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
we
are
not
bound
by
the
contract,
we
are
not
bound
to
obey
the
board’s
order
that
we
honor
this
agreement.
now,
if
that
is
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
well,
i
--
if
i
said
that
mr.
justice
marshall
i
--
would
i
--
we
are
not
taking
a
position
assuming
that
we
are
a
successor
that
we
would
not
have
to
arbitrate.
we
would
have
to
arbitrate
if
that
--
and
we
would
have
to
arbitrate
to
the
extent
to
which
the
agreement
is
binding,
which
is
what
they
did
in
wiley.
i
would
like
to
point
that
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
only
if
the
arbitrator
would
so
order
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
it
was
not
an
nlrb
case
and
it
is
clear
that
the
principles
of
301
are
not
necessarily
applied
to
unfair
labor
practice
cases.
three
years
ago,
i
argued
before
this
court
in
strong
roofing
and
which
mr.
justice
white
wrote
the
opinion
against
us.
we
were
arguing
in
strong
roofing
that
the
labor
board
did
not
have
the
power
to
order
an
employer
to
pay
fringe
benefits.
that
this
was
a
subject
of
arbitration,
but
because
of
a
clear
as
mr.
justice
white
said
because
of
a
clear
provisions
of
section
10
(a)
and
10
(c)
of
the
act
giving
the
board
a
large
remedial
powers
and
in
that
case
the
doctrines
of
301
applied
to
courts,
did
not
apply
to
the
board
because
of
the
provisions
section
10
of
the
act
and
we
say
that
the
same
thing
applies
here.
though
the
rules
with
respect
to
section
301
do
not
apply
because
of
a
clear
intent
of
congress
in
8
(b)
not
to
permit
the
labor
board.
they
were
very
concerned
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
and
contempt,
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
that
is
correct
and
they
left
it
to
the
arbitrator
and
his
expertise
to
so
hold.
now,
the
board
really
is
overreaching
when
they
say
that
the
result
called
for
here
is
to
promote
industrial
peace
and
to
--
and
that
there
is
a
policy
of
maintaining
collective
bargaining
agreements.
the
policy
of
section
1
of
the
act
is
to
promote
collective
bargaining,
not
the
imposition
brought
on
consenting
parties
of
collective
bargaining
agreements
and
that
is
what
they
have
done
here
and
the
courts,
the
strife
argument
was
made
in
h.k.
porter.
it
was
there
a
flagrant
case
of
the
employer
of
bargaining
in
bad
faith
and
refusing
to
adduce,
check
off
provision
or
it
had
in
other
plants,
it
had
adduced
check
off
provision
and
just
did
not
want
to
have
one
here
in
that
plant,
and
no
other
legitimate
economic
reasons
whatsoever.
and
it
would
have
saved
economic
strife.
it
would
not
had
so
much
economic
strife
possibly
if
this
court
had
ordered
the
employer
to
be
bound,
to
adduce
to
check
of
provisions,
but
it
did
not.
there
would
be
industrial
peace
if
there
was
compulsory
arbitration
in
this
country
maybe.
although
in
some
european
countries
where
they
have
had
co-determination
and
government
intervention
they
have
had
national
strifes
if
anything
but
industrial
peace
but
maybe
it
would
but
that
is
not
what
congress
has
intended
here.
plant
closures
cause
industrial
strife
but
in
darlington
this
court
held
that
you
could
close
a
plant
for
union
activity
because
you
did
not
like
--
you
did
not
want
your
plant
organized
and
that
kind
of
industrial
strife
is
great.
so
under
free
collective
bargaining
which
is
what
we
have
at
this
time,
strife
and
strikes
are
sometimes
necessary
and
of
course
the
fact
that
you
have
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
does
not
mean
that
you
are
necessarily
going
to
be
free
from
strikes.
all
of
us
know
the
situations
where
employees
and
unions
have
struck
in
violation
of
collective
bargaining
agreements
and
refused
to
go
back
in
the
face
of
court
order.
(voice
overlap)
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
i
do
not
follow
that
mr.
justice.
i
do
not
know.
if
i
could
other
than
if
we
were
a
successor
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
well,
they
could
file
a
petition
and
there
could
have
been
an
election
if
either
one,
yes,
then
we
would
have
and
that
is
really
where
are
on
the
successorship
issue.
we
are
not
saying
that
there
is
not
a
way
for
these
employees
to
have
the
union.
we
are
just
saying
that
we
ought
to
have
an
election
as
the
way
rather
than
having
the
union
imposed
upon
the
employees
and
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
no.
we
were
not.
that
unit
had
been
agreed
to.
it
was
a
consent
unit.
it
was
not
the
board’s
determination
on
the
unit
it
was
the
consent
your
honor.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
there
was
a
certification
based
upon
the
consent
agreement.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
but
the
parties,
not
the
labor
board
agreed
to
the
unit.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
yes.
we
think
we
could
challenge
that
unit,
yes
sir,
and
we
so
argued
below
that
we
could
challenge
that
unit.
the
certification
here
is
not
all
encompassing
that.
they
are
unusual
circumstances
and
we
think
that
in
this
case
this
change
of
ownership,
the
integration
etcetera
would
be
a
(voice
overlap)
unusual
circumstances
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
i
believe
so.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
yes.
but
we
are
not
contending
that
the
appropriate
unit
and
the
employing
industry
are
the
same
thing
at
all.
we
are
saying
that
those
are
two
different
concepts
and
we
did
contest
the
unit
and
we
did
not
raise
it
specifically
unless
it
is
raised
in
out
question
number
one,
in
our
certification
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
i
think
both
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
both
were
alleged,
yes.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
that
is
--
we
make
that
point
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
we
are
not
a
party
to
the
agreement
and
the
--
congress
was
clear
with
the
language
of
party.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
they
are
relying
on
8
(d).
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
8
(d).
no,
because
8
(d)
defines
8
(a)
(5).
8
(d)
is
the
section
that
tells
what
8
(a)
(5)
and
means
and
so
8
(a)
(5)
just
says
refuse
to
bargain
in
good
faith
then
8
(d)
says
what
that
means
so
they
go
together.
you
cannot
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
that
is
right.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
well,
i
do
not
--
i
do
not
see
how
they
can
separate
the
two
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
in
any
event
we
rely
on
8
(d)
as
a
proscription
on
the
board’s
power
on
unfair
labor
practice
cases
to
require
somebody
to
be
obligated
to
an
agreement.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
you
have
to
be
a
party.
the
board
has
no
power
to
order
it
to,
you
should
be
a
party.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
they
could
--
they
do
not
like
to
go
to
the
last
part.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
if
we
are
a
successor
then
if
we
have
unilaterally
modified
the
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
well,
that
is
a
good
question.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
that
is
right.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
modify,
that
is
8
(d)
and
that
is
the
provision
that
the
board
relies
on
to
find
a
violation
of
8
(a)
(5)
for
a
unilateral
modification.
this
court
as
you
point
out
has
never
so
ruled
on
that
point.
in
strong
roofing
there
is
some
dicta
that
would
indicate
in
that
direction
but
this
court
and
not
all
courts
ruled
on
that
question
and
the
board
in
its
most
recent
prior
case
as
while
not
exceeding
that
it
does
not
have
a
power,
it
now
says
that
it
is
going
to
defer
questions
of
modification
to
arbitration,
a
position
that
many
of
those
had
been
urging
the
board
for
sometime,
this
most
recent
prior
case
and
the
case
indicates
that
that
is
the
direction
the
board's
going
to
go
at
this
time.
now,
the
purposes
of
the
act
will
be
effectuated
by
assuming
a
successorship
by
requiring
good
faith
bargaining
and
the
arbitration
that
wiley
permits.
we
are
not
asking
the
court
to
back
away
at
all
on
the
wiley
case.
arbitrator,
the
arbitrator
is
more
qualified
and
desirable
and
quicker
to
interpret
these
matters
than
the
labor
board
and
we
submit
that
the
board’s
rule
of
imposing
collective
bargaining
agreements
will
cause
serious
inequities
upon
the
parties
as
judge
hayes
pointed
out,
counsel
alluded
to
the
duro
rule
as
judge
hayes
pointed
out,
it
would
be
very
unfair
to
a
labor
union
that
made
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
failing
company,
let
us
say
for
three
years
on
very
favorable
terms
to
then
have
that
company
acquired
by
certain
--
some
large
company
that
is
not
at
all
failing
and
be
obligated
to
that
agreement
for
two-and-a-half
to
three
years.
this
would
be
a
serious
inequity
as
judge
hayes
pointed
out
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
through
section
301
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
yes
sir.
no
question
about
that.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
i
do
not
follow
that.
[laughter]
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
yes.
they
could
have
deferred
arbitration
and
that
is
what
they
have
now
done
in
(inaudible),
that
is
what
they
have
done.
the
board’s
rule
really
also
from
a
policy
standpoint
in
our
view
would
really
unduly
restrain
competition
in
this
area.
the
board
points
this
out
in
emerald
maintenance
and
they
point
out
that
there
it
is
under
a
service
contract
act,
but
there
is
a
policy
permitting
a
government
contractor
to
bid
lockheed
as
a
99%
government
contractor.
while
it
is
true
that
this
contract
with
burns
was
not
out
of
the
service
contract
act
yet
the
same
policy
applies
with
saving
the
government
money
which
is
really
what
the
air
force
argued
in
emerald
maintenance
that
a
policy
of
contract
honoring
would
cause
the
government
because
of
its
inability
to
have
lower
bids
that
same
principle
would
apply
here.
also
often
times
the
alternative
for
a
company
that
is
in
the
place
of
being
acquired
is
to
go
out
of
business,
if
it
cannot
be
acquired.
now,
we
submit
that
this
rule
of
contract
honoring,
requiring,
imposing
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
going
to
be
a
deterrent
to
acquisitions
because
an
employer
that
comes
in
and
wants
to
buy
a
company
is
a
successor.
he
has
no
--
he
does
not
mind
about
bargaining
with
the
union
but
he
wants
to
try
that
to
get
some
changes
in
that
collective
bargaining
agreement.
it
may
well
be
that
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
has
caused
the
company
to
be
in
the
position
it
is
in.
now,
if
this
is
prevented,
we
are
going
to
have
a
lot
more
industrial
strike
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
yes
sir,
it
does.
and
i
have
just
said
that.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
in
the
service
industry
and
in
any
industry.
in
any
industry
it
would
have
that
effect
if
the
contract
is
because
no
one
could
come
in
and
bid
any
and
particularly
would
it
be
so
in
these
industries
where
the
big
bulk
of
the
price
is
the
cost
of
the
service.
mr.

he
could
bargain,
he
--
we
--
if
we
are
a
successor
we
would
bargain
with
the
union
and
it
may
depending
upon
economic
power,
may
have
--
get
a
better
economic
arrangement
or
not.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
and
this
is
the
system
that
we
have
been
under.
we
submit
that
burns
is
not
a
successor
because
of
the
peculiar
industry
involved
here
and
that
in
any
event
assuming
that
burns
is
a
successor
that
the
board
has
no
power
to
impose
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
thank
you
very
much.
