justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
i
get
this
clear?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
under
the
court
of
appeals
decision
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
now
the
only
issue
as
to
which
he
did
not
agree
with
the
board
was
whether
although
burns
has
to
recognize,
what
is
it,
plant
guards,
united
plant
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
it
has
to
deal
with
the
united
plant
guard
and
not
with
the
old
american,
whatever
it
was,
nevertheless,
they
would
have
to
work
out
a
new
agreement.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
between
plant
guard
and
burns
and
that
if
burns
would
not
oblige,
they
will
simply
carry
on
the
old
agreement
with
--
agreement
made
with
wackenhut,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
as
the
cross
petition
of
the
--
of
burns
that
it
disagrees
with
so
much
of
the
order
that
says
that
the
--
burns
has
to
deal
with
(inaudible).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
are
those
the
only
two
questions
we
have?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
for
the
invitation
of
the
bid
went
out
after
the
agreed
--
new
agreement
had
been
signed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
any
evidence
that
anyone
knew
that
there
was
going
to
be
invitation
to
bid?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
that
previous
contract
include
successors
in
turn?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
they
show
whether
there
was
any
special
attention
given
to
the
inclusion
of
that
provision
in
this
concept.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
but
the
source
of
the
arbitration
was
the
contract,
was
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
would
not
have
been
an
arbitration
except
for
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
entirely
an
arbitration?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
at
least
to
that
extent
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
wiley
held
that
successors
bound
by
a
provision
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
but
--
that
it
had
been
no
of
[laughter]
no
obligation
to
arbitrate
except
to
what
which
was
created
by
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
wiley
speaks
this
is
compulsory
arbitration?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
come.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
what
does
the
court
opinion
means,
this
under
contract?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
that
is
what
i
am
looking
at.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
8
(d)
is
not
an
independent
unfair
labor
practice,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me
a
definition
of
that
as
a
collective
bargaining
is
collected,
is
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
8
(a)
(5)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
do
not
suppose
it
is
said
in
the
court
but
i
gather
technically
the
violations
is
8
(a)
(5)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
tell
me
mr.
come,
does
--
do
the
decisions
in
emerald
maintenance
(inaudible)
would
say
gather
about
a
year
later
than
the
decision
here
by
the
board.
do
they
represent
some
retreat
from
the
principles
of
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
fact
is
in
neither
case
was
the
employer
held
bound
by
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
