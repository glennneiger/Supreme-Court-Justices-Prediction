we
will
hear
arguments
next
in

national

relations
board
against
burns
international
and
burns
against
the
board
in
number

mr.
come
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
come
if
–-
perhaps
this
question
is
a
little
bit
too
early,
but
if
you
will
bear
in
mind
now
certainly
when
you
want,
if
burns
have
not
employed
any
of
the
wackenhut
people,
they
employed
27,
i
think
some
such
figures,
they
have
not
employed
any,
would
you
contend
they
were
a
successor
employer
because
they
moved
in
and
performed
the
same
function?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
before
you
go
on
to
that
mr.
come,
what
you
have
said
sounds
as
though,
you
are
talking
about
a
case
in
which
burns
came
in
and
took
over
and
along
with
the
takeover
of
the
activity,
took
over
employees.
now,
my
reading
of
this
record
is
that
burns
was
one
of
the
competing
bidders,
great
many
people
bid
for
this
contract
and
this
company
has
awarded
it
to
burns
as
the
low
bidder,
so
there
were
competitors
of
the
man
you
--
of
the
company
you
now
suggest
is
this
company
to
which
they
are
successor,
these
employees
were
then,
the
27
employees
ultimately
taken
within
on
the
open
labor
market,
were
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
they
were
hired
one
by
one.
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
have
got
those
facts
clear.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
come,
you
may
continue.
you
have
six
minutes
remaining
of
your
total
time.
chief
justice

chief

that
language,
successors
and
assigns,
is
that
language
historically
had
been
the
kind
of
language
used
to
describe
successors
in
this
context
or
is
that
standard,
lawyers
work
in
contract
in
documents
of
all
kind?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
there
is
a
continuity
factor
from
the
standpoint
of
the
employer
too,
is
there
not?
it
is
the
--
burns
having
an
established
relationship
with
other
unions
or
any
one
in
the
posture
of
burns
might
have
some
real
problems
if
they
have
to
divide
up
and
deal
with
the
number
of
unions,
would
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
am
speaking
to
this
particular
union.
assume
they
had
a
union
that
was
part
of
american
federation
of
labor
and
established,
recognized,
acknowledged
union,
you
would
have
some
jurisdictional
problems
then,
would
you
not,
if
they
came
in
with
a
contract
that
they
were
obliged
to
recognize
that
union
in
any
acquisitions
that
they
came
to,
if
they
acquired
any
new
plants
or
branches
or
agency?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
your
position
be
the
same
if
five
or
six
or
seven
of
the
employees
of
burns
has
gone
over
to
wackenhut,
it
is
better
if
20
or
some?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
how
about
none
--
how
about
if
there
were
no
employees?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
gregory.
mr.
bakaly.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
the
other
provisions
of
the
contract
other
than
arbitration
you
have
to
--
all
of
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
bakaly.
mr.
come
you
have
about
seven
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
come,
i
have
one
question,
i
am
sure
you
want
to
deal
with
it
with
a
very
short
answer.
do
i
get
your
position
correctly,
the
board’s
position
now
that
someone
taking
over
a
large
operation,
whether
it'd
be
its
maintenance
force
or
its
security
force,
having
a
large
number
of
employees
and
instead
of
a
bidding
process
such
as
we
had
here,
burns
under
bidding
wackenhut
and
the
others,
the
basic
factory
or
operator
is
terminating
the
contract
with
the
guard
service
company
because
they
are
unreliable,
untrustworthy,
inefficient,
that
there
is
pilfering
going
on,
all
sorts
of
things
that
happen
in
these
types
of
service
organizations.
now,
is
it
your
position
that
the
“successor”
who
takes
over
that
function,
either
of
maintaining
the
building
or
protecting
it
has
got
to
take
lock,
stock
and
barrel,
all
the
employees
in
those
circumstances?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
pretty
close
to
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
what
did
you
have
in
mind
when
you
suggested
that
--
in
the
response
to
mr.
justice
white
that
perhaps
the
other
15
that
they
did
not
take
might
have
a
grievance
for
not
being
taken
over
by
burns?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
assume
you
meant
a
colorable
claim?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
whose
employees
are
they?
is
that
not
the
question?
they
are
the
employees
of
the
first,
the
one
in
the
posture
of
wackenhut
here,
but
i
took
your
position
before
us
expressed
to
say
that
for
all
practical
purposes
they
are
employees
of
whoever
takes
over
that
function,
whether
it
is
on
winning
by
a
lower
bid
or
whether
cancellation
or
termination
of
a
prior
contract?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
friend
when
he
argued
said
that
even
if
they
had
not
taken
over
any,
even
if
they
have
not
taken
over
a
single
employee,
the
legal
situation
would
be
the
same?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
that
is
to
be
a
majority?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
come,
i
have
kept
you
overtime.
chief
justice
warren
e.

thank
you

the
case
is
