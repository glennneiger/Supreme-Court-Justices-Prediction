chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
number
79,
reliance
electric
company
against
emerson
electric
company.
mr.
mulligan
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
the
purport
of
the
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
make
a
distinction
between
a
decision
and
the
plan
where
you
juxtapose
the
two
statements,
the
eighth
circuit’s
evaluation
against
the
statement
from
the
brief,
i
am
not
sure.
i
see
these
two
necessarily
in
such
a
complete
conflict
as
you
do.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
they
draw
up
plan,
you
mean
they
drew
up
something
in
writing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
it
is
not
drawing
up
the
plan,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
judge
reagan
is
finding
then
was
directly
opposed
to
advise
of
counsel
both
for
reliance
and
for
emerson
or
his
conclusion.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
do
not
think
judge
reagan
used
the
term
plan
anywhere,
did
he
or
did
he?
i
noticed
the
one,
the
coded
material
you
--
well,
that
is
the
eighth
circuit.
it
determined,
it
is
the
eighth
circuit
that
you
have
used,
determine
rather
than
planned.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
do
not
recall
that
that
dates,
mr.
mulligan,
how
much
longer
would
they
have
had
to
wait
to
get
out
from
under
your
view
of
the
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
often
happens
in
the
application
of
the
taxing
statutes,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--of
the
ways
doing
the
same
thing
will
produce
very,
very
different
result.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
could
be
your
view
mr.
mulligan
if
the
record
showed
that
a
sale
of
this
9.6,
the
bulk
of
these
securities
was
made
six
months
and
one
day
rather
than
approximately
three
months
and
that
this
was
pursuant
to
resolution
of
the
board
of
directors
to
sell
it
within
24
hours
after
the
six
months
period
had
expired?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
is
there
really
all
that
much
difference
between
that
kind
of
predetermined
plan,
decision
on
six
months
and
one
day
and
cutting
the
holdings
down
to
something
less
than
10%,
if
each
one
of
them
in
avoidance
of
the
impact
of
the
statute
or
at
least
the
motivation.
we
do
not
know
whether
the
result
is.
the
motivation
in
each
case
is
to
avoid
the
impact
of
the
statute,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
though
he
has
actual
inside
information?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
not
equally
true
of
the
six
months
and
one
day
sale?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
congress
has
also
said
10%
not
9.6.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
mulligan.
mr.
north.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
what
as
justice
stewart
suggested
there
are
necessity,
a
lot
of
arbitrary
things
in
the
statute
like
this.
the
problems
would
arise
where
the
reality
exists,
where
a
man
acquires
more
than
10%
by
inheritance
or
gift,
is
that
not
the
reality
of
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
congress
had
to
draw
some
lines
so
they
drew
a
whole
series
of
lines.
they
drew
the
10%
line,
they
drew
the
six
months
line.
they
did
not
even
say
180
days.
suppose
some
fellow
got
mixed
up
in
a
leap
year
and
miscalculated
his
time,
if
he
miscalculated
and
that
was
not
relied
on
the
one
measurement
instead
of
the
other,
if
it
was
less
than
six
months
of
the
statute,
the
acts
would
fall
on
it,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
north.
jenner
you
will
have
about
11
minutes
for
today.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
for
the
actual
information
really
is
not
an
issue.
is
it
in
these
cases?
they
are
just
statutory
presumption
of
information
resulting
from
the
amount
of
stock
that
is
held,
is
that
not
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
out
of
his
way,
he
is
saying
that
he
did
not
imbued
any
bad
faith
or
bluffing
or
conspiracy
to
anybody.
it
was
just
--
it
was
taking
this
in
one
sense
very
literal
review
of
the
statute
and
then
in
another
sense
perhaps
not.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
this
would
be,
perhaps
a
good
place
to
stop.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
pick
up
there
in
the
morning
mr.
jenner.
chief
justice
warren
e.

--
79,
mr.

you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
jenner.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
make
this
a
little
more
difficult
perhaps
by
picking
up
the
point
you
had
touched
on
about
using
--
i
think
different
brokers
and
that
sort
of
thing.
suppose
instead
of
having
these
separated
by
a
number
of
days,
the
first
sale
had
been
at
nine
o’clock
in
the
morning,
if
that
is
when
the
exchange
opens,
and
then
the
second
sale
had
been
at
three
in
the
afternoon
if
that
is
when
it
closes.
would
your
case,
would
your
arguments,
would
your
points
be
any
different?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
you
are
saying
is
that
congress
did
the
razor
cutting
here
and
did
it
deliberately
in
a
razor
--
in
a
situation
that
called
for
razor
--
.
chief
justice
warren
e.

blau.
chief
justice
warren
e.

you

are
you
saying

a
mechanistic

may
have
a
mechanistic
response?
chief

e.

thank
you
mr.

you
