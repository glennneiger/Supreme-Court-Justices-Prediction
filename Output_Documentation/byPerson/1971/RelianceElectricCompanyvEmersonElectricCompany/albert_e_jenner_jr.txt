mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
i
am
troubled
by
both
arguments
because
neither
argument
presents
my
little
case
before
this
court
and
all
i
am
seeking
is
to
have
the
court
decide
my
case
and
not
decide
other
cases.
by
a
parade
of
horribles
or
otherwise,
by
mr.
mulligan,
a
distinguish
lawyer
from
cleveland
seeking
to
retain
for
his
client,
who
participated
in
the
purchase
of
the
sales,
the
profit
reselling
from
their
purchase
of
these
--
the
stock
from
reliance.
and
may
i
in
the
few
minutes
this
afternoon,
i
would
like
to
devote
if
i
may
to
stating
the
facts
of
this
case
as
mr.
justice
stewart
said,
the
case
in
1958
when
he
wrote
the
opinion
for
the
unanimous
court,
that
if
the
trend
has
come
to
be
as
you,
mr.
chief
justice
had
indicated
when
you
wrote
the
opinion
as
the
circuit
justice
of
the
second
circuit
is
to
examine
the
facts
in
each
case
and
decide
each
case.
now,
before
i
state
the
facts
in
this
case
which
were
relayed
directly
mr.
justice
blackmun
to
one
of
the
inquires
you
made
as
to
whether
or
not
in
fact
emerson
had
any
inside
information
of
any
kind
of
character
at
all
to
which
mr.
mulligan
did
not
give
you
a
correct
answer
or
according
to
the
record
in
which
there
is
a
direct
finding
in
the
case
in
which
dodge
brought
suit
against
emerson.
in
which
district
judge
grant
held
in
the
case
that
i
tried
and
represented
emerson
that
emerson
not
only
had
no
inside
information
but
no
possibility
of
obtaining
inside
information.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
you
are
absolutely
correct
mr.
chief
justice,
but
counsel
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
that
is
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
but
in
those
who
seek
to
argue
the
meaning
of
this
and
i
may
say
harsh
statute.
they
turn
at
times
to
intend
when
an
argument
of
an
intent
will
favor
them.
and
they
turn
to
the
artificiality
of
the
statute
that
is
a
presumed
fiduciary
relationships
because
of
a
holding
of
a
10%
or
more.
but
when
that
does
not
suit
the
attempt
to
induce
a
court
to
interpret
this
narrow
language
then
they
adopt
a
different.
now,
if
your
honors
please,
have
this
in
mind
overnight.
emerson
electric
on
the
22
of
may
1967
made
a
tender
offer
for
the
purchase
of
the
shares
of
dodge
manufacturing
company
of
mishawaka,
indiana
near
south
bend.
prior
to
the
time
that
they
made
that
tender
offer,
they
had
negotiated
with
the
officers
and
directors
of
dodge
manufacturing
company
in
the
hope
that
they
could
arrange
a
merger
with
dodge
and
emerson.
those
discussions
came
of
not
and
when
those
discussions
did
end
is
when
emerson
electric
made
a
tender
offer
from
the
shares
of
dodge
manufacturing
company.
the
original
tender
exercise
date
was
june
2,
1967.
as
soon
as
it
became
known,
we
announced
necessarily
on
a
tender
offer
you
cannot
reach
shareholders
so
you
publish
in
newspapers
and
wall
street
journals.
when
it
became
known
to
the
dodge
managers
of
that
company
that
we
had
submitted
a
tender
offer
for
the
shares
of
dodge
at
a
very
substantial
increase
over
the
then
price,
as
a
matter
of
fact
$20
per
share,
the
dodge
management
immediately
contacted
all
its
shareholders
immediately
and
said
to
them,
do
not
tender
your
share.
two
days
later,
the
dodge
management
then
entered
into
a
negotiations
with
reliance
for
a
defensive
merger
to
defeat
the
tender
offer.
that
is
to
have
the
shareholders
of
dodge
approve
a
merger
of
dodge
into
reliance
and
that
would
destroy
the
tender
offer.
and
that
was
announced
to
its
shareholders
immediately
and
they
were
urged
in
favor
to
consider
the
defense
of
merger
that
was
tendered.
in
addition
to
that,
dodge
filed
suit
in
a
northern
district
of
indiana
before
his
honor,
judge
grant,
to
enjoin
emerson
from
proceeding
with
its
tender
offer
claiming
that
emerson
had
obtained
confidential
information
from
dodge
during
the
course
of
the
attempts
of
emerson
to
interest
dodge
management
in
a
merger
of
dodge
into
emerson.
and
it
charged
in
that
complaint
under
section
10
(b)
and
regulation
10
(b)
(5)
of
the
securities
and
exchange
act.
that
emerson
had
obtained
confidential
information
during
the
course
of
the
discussions
with
dodge
management
on
the
subject
matter
for
possible
merger
of
dodge
into
emerson.
it
was
in
that
case
that
i
represented
emerson
and
tried
the
case.
it
was
tried
before
judge
grant.
and
after
an
extend
of
hearing
with
a
lot
of
proof
taken,
judge
grant
held
expressly
that
emerson
had
acted
in
good
faith
throughout
and
had
never
obtained
any
confidential
information
of
any
kind
or
dirt
that
what
it
had
obtained
by
way
of
information
was
in
14
case,
10
case,
other
matters
public
with
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
once
they
could
examine
annual
reports
and
matters
of
that
character.
and
so
judge
grant
vacated
the
temporary
restraining
order
that
he
had
entered
against
emerson
restraining
up
from
proceeding
with
this
tender
offer.
and
we
extended
that
tender
offer
to
june
2,
1967
with
the
approval
of
judge
grant.
now,
we
were
faced
to
that
particular
time
with
the
defensive
merger
suggested
by
dodge
to
merge
dodge
into
emerson
and
so
at
that
point,
we
proposed
as
a
accountable
that
we
would
submit
to
the
shareholders
of
dodge
a
proposal
for
merger
of
dodge
and
emerson
in
which
we
would
exchange
convertible
preferred
shares
of
emerson
for
dodge
stock
as
reliance
has
--
was
proposing
to
give
to
the
dodge
shareholders
convertible
preferred
shares
for
dodge
stock
except
that
we
claimed
by
publication
otherwise
that
our
merger
offer
was
more
advantageous
of
the
shareholders
of
dodge
than
the
reliance.
and
we
made
a
demand
on
the
management
of
dodge
that
they
submit
the
emerson
proposed
merger
to
the
shareholders
of
dodge
which
the
man
has
run
on
directors
of
dodge
refused
to
do.
also,
we
demand
that
a
right
to
see
--
to
have
a
shareholders
list
so
we
can
communicate
with
the
shareholders
of
dodge.
management
refused
to
give
us
that
list.
we
filed
suit
in
the
superior
court
of
whatever
that
county
is
in
northern
indiana
and
we
--
that
is
the
only
way
we
were
able
to
get
a
shareholder’s
list
then
we
got.
then
we
filed
suit
when
management
refused
to
submit
the
emerson
merger
proposal
to
the
dodge
shareholders
and
we
could
not
get
it
to
them
for
a
vote.
we
then
decided
we
would
go
ahead
with
the
proxy
fight
to
see
if
we
could
defeat
the
merger
of
dodge
into
emerson.
and
emerson
turned
or
dodge
turned
around
and
sued
us
to
enjoin
us
as
submitting
our
merger
proposal
of
merger
of
dodge
into
emerson.
i
believe
all
these
with
you
up
to
this
point
to
show
that
it
was
impossible
for
anybody
to
get
any
confidential
information
of
any
kind
or
character
and
that
judge
grant
held
expressly
that
we
had
not
obtained
them.
now,
the
proposal
for
the
merger
of
dodge
into
reliance
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
think
it
is.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
apologize,
i
seem
to
suffered
a
cold
overnight
and
i
may
have
a
little
problem
with
my
voice.
i
was
concluding
yesterday,
i
was
reciting
the
facts
applicable
here
regarding
primarily
upon
the
question
of
whether,
not
only
whether
the
emerson
had
inside
information
but
whether
it
was
humanly
possible
for
emerson
to
obtain
inside
information,
let
alone
abuse
the
inside
information
if
they
have
obtained
any.
i
reached
the
point
in
which
i
had
stated
to
the
court.
this
appears
in
my
record.
that
when
emerson
made
a
counter
merger
offer
to
meet
reliance’s
and
dodge’s
merger
offer.
emerson
then
launched
into
a
proxy
contest
to
solicit
proxies
to
double
purpose.
for
the
purpose
of
defeating
the
proposed
merger
of
dodge
into
reliance
at
the
special
circle
this
meeting
that
had
been
called
and
also
to
obtain
proxies
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
a
special
meeting
to
require
the
dodge
board
of
directors
to
submit
to
dodge,
stockholders
the
counter-merger
offer
of
emerson
which
emerson
claimed
was
a
superior
offer
by
way
of
merger
for
the
shareholders
of
dodge
as
against
the
reliance
offer.
in
the
meantime,
as
all
of
you
will
realize
regardless
of
this
case,
these
proceeding
served
the
benefit
of
the
shareholders
of
dodge
very
much
because
the
tender
offer
at
$18.25
above
the
market.
reliance’s,
dodge’s
proposed
merger,
at
still
a
higher
figure
in
the
way
of
shares,
i
remember
that
as
convertible
shares.
and
that
emerson
coming
back
with
another
proposed
merger
of
dodge
in
to
emerson,
that
is
still
a
higher
figure.
the
market
price
for
the
dodge
shares
has
kept
going
up
and
up
and
up.
this
had
nothing
to
do
with
an
inside
information
but
as
this
is
typical
many
times
and
most
of
the
time
of
tender
offers
that
the
market
price
of
shares
of
the
target
company
tends
to
rise
very
materially.
first,
because
the
tender
offer
is
always
at
a
higher
price
than
the
market
at
the
time
it
is
--
the
tender
offer
is
submitted
otherwise,
it
would
not
be
effective.
and
the
counter-merger
by
way
of
it
--
to
defeat
a
tender
offer,
likewise
raises
this
price
of
stock
because
the
merger
proposal
is
always
at
a
still
figure
or
it
would
be
not
be
attractive.
it
appeared
to
mr.
mcroberts,
the
general
counsel
of
emerson,
at
this
point,
that
is
at
the
point
that
emerson
began
to
solicit
proxies
to
defeat
the
merger
of
dodge
into
reliance
and
to
bring
about
consideration
by
shareholders
of
the
emerson
offer
of
merger
of
dodge
into
emerson.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes.
the
tender
offer
shares
were
purchased
on
the
16th
of
june,
so
this
came
after
that
point.
you
are
right
with
that
mr.
justice.
mr.
mcroberts
then
wrote
the
letter
that
my
brother
mulligan
complains
about,
i
think
what
that
somewhat
(inaudible).
and
that
appears
commencing
at
page
36
of
the
record.
and
what
was
mr.
mcroberts’
concern
about?
he
was
concerned
about
first
this,
that
under
the
cases
that
had
been
decided
up
to
that
time,
stella
and
others.
that
if
the
merger
of
dodge
into
reliance
was
approved
at
the
special
shareholders
meeting
called
for
the
22nd
of
august,
that
the
receipt
by
emerson
of
the
conferrable
preferred
shares
of
reliance,
the
surviving
company
in
exchange
for
the
155,000
shares
of
dodge
that
emerson
had
acquired
by
way
of
the
tender
offer
on
june
16th.
we
constitute
a
sale.
and
if
constituting
a
sale
would
under
the
cases
then
bring
emerson
within
at
that
point,
16(b),
and
it
would
require
emerson
then
to
pay
to
reliance,
the
difference
in
value
gained
over
the
price
paid
for
the
tender
offer
shares
which
was
$63.00
a
share
and
the
value
of
the
convertible
preferred
received
in
the
merger
of
dodge
into
emerson.
and
he
so
says,
as
your
honors
will
note,
in
his
letter
of
opinion.
now
it
is
true
that
in
his
letter
of
opinion
where
he
cautioned
emerson
about
this
fact
that
they
were
going
to
--
that
they
had
the
danger
of
being
involuntarily
held
to
have
made
a
sale
of
the
tender
offer
shares
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
merger
of
dodge
into
reliance
had
come
about
by
approval
of
the
shareholders.
and
then
subsequent
approval
of
the
board
of
directors
because
under
the
indiana
statute,
the
approval
of
the
shareholders
of
a
merger
does
not
consummate
that
merger.
the
board
of
directors
must
under
the
indiana
statute
approve
it
and
then
it
becomes
consummated.
so
he
said,
in
his
letter
of
opinion,
this
constitutes
a
danger
and
--
you
should
begin
to
prepare
yourself
to
see
if
you
can
avoid
that
had
a
cosmic
result
where
the
time
company
has
been
preventing
you
from
obtaining
information,
preventing
you
reaching
its
shareholders
and
doing
everything
it
can
to
lock
you
out
and
to
cut
off
all
communication.
still
you
are
running
to
the
ironical
situation
because
of
this
mechanical
simplistic
statute
that
you
may
be
involuntarily
come
within
it
and
you
will
notice
that
at
page
36,
he
does
recite
those
circumstances.
but
he
did
anticipate
also
the
possibility,
your
honors,
as
my
brother
mulligan
had
said
to
your
honors
yesterday
that
perhaps
they
could
sell
if
they
wish
or
desire
or
needed
to
sale
the
tender
offer
shares
acquired
in
the
future.
but
there
was
at
that
time,
if
your
honors
please,
no,
they
had
been
no
negotiations
with
reliance
on
that
score.
reliance
was
resisting
us
and
dodge
was
resisting
us.
there
had
been
no
offer
to
purchase.
there
had
been
--
we
have
not
undertaken
a
negotiator
sale.
counsel
wesmick
(ph)
roberts
was
advising
his
client,
you
are
in
danger.
and
mr.
chief
justice,
when
you
asked
mr.
mulligan
yesterday
what
was
the
only
way?
what
was
the
way
you
could
--
that
emerson,
you
are
out
of
this
situation
and
mr.
mulligan
responded
to
you,
well
all
they
had
to
do
was
wait
until
six
months
or
six
months
and
one
day
from
the
tender
offer
purchase
date,
june
16th,
1967.
but
that
was
not
so
because
mr.
mulligan
overlooks
the
fact
which
mr.
mcroberts
did
appreciate
and
that
is
the
danger
that
when
the
dodge
–
reliance
merger
should
it
be
approved
by
the
shareholders
and
then
by
the
board
of
directors
that
that
would
constitute
a
sale.
and
mr.
mcroberts’
judgment
will
happen
to
be
right
on
that
score
because
the
newmark
case
came
down.
not
long
after
that
in
which
the
second
circuit
so
held.
now
mr.
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes
sir,
under
the
--
and
in
the
newmark
case
in
the
second
quarter
--
the
court
so
held
and
that
was
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
involuntary.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
unless
as
some
of
the
cases
held
and
as
pointed
out
by
mr.
justice
stewart
as
a
sixth
circuit
judge,
the
securities
received
were
--
should
be
the
substantial
equivalent
of
the
security
surrendered,
that
is
in
price
and
in
terms
and
in
effect,
if
they
are
they
are
the
substantial
equivalent
then
the
courts
held
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes,
you
had
first,
mr.
justice
brennan,
you
had
first
of
great
difference
in
price.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
well,
the
difference
is
--
first
we
offered
$63.00,
that
was
$18.25
above
the
market
and
then
the
dodge
--
reliance
securities
were
estimated
to
be
at
a
value
of
around
$76.00
to
$80.00
a
share.
and
the
emerson
management
touted
that
they
had
even
higher
figure.
i
do
not
mean
to
use
the
word
touted
in
any
--
depreciatingly
fashioned.
but
there
was
a
difference
in
value
and
more
important
if
your
honor
pleases,
the
shares
to
be
received
in
the
merger
of
dodge
into
reliance
were
convertible
preferred
shares.
so
at
that
would
give
emerson
another
option
it
would
write
on
the
preferred
until
--
if
the
market
would
be
--
of
the
common
came
offered
would
be
propitious
for
it
to
exercise
that
option.
so
it
was
pretty
clear
that
what
emerson
would
receive
had
it
gone
through
and
waited
till
beyond
the
consummation
of
the
merger
would
necessarily
come
within
what
the
cases
were
then
holding
and
which
newmark
--
in
the
second
circuit
newmark
did
subsequently
hold.
so
at
that
point,
the
man
that
is
one
of
emersons
receiving
this
opinion
of
its
counsel
became
concerned
naturally.
they
still
thought
they
had
the
chance
of
defeating
the
merger.
and
being
successful
on
the
proxy
side,
so
that
is
what
i
have
--
but
the
point
i
want
to
emphasize
is.
it
is
unlike
mr.
mulligan’s
representation
to
your
honors
yesterday.
he
used
the
word
scheme
that
on
the
advise
of
its
counsel,
the
management
of
emerson’s
scheme
to
try
and
avoid
the
harsh
results
of
16
(b)
by
reducing
by
one
sale,
the
percentage
of
its
shares
in
dodge
from
13.2
to
9.96.
now,
if
the
advise
of
counsel,
reading
the
authorities,
subsequent
confirmed
in
his
urge
constitutes
a
scheme
in
the
sense
that
it
is
invidious
and
odious,
where
we
are
going
with
that.
but
it
was
advise
of
counsel
and
if
section
16
(b)
is
to
construed
by
this
court
that
if
--
because
counsel
advises
the
client
of
a
problem
and
suggests
a
possible
solution
of
it
that
that
is
a
plan
or
scheme
for
which
the
client
is
to
be
punished,
then
i
respectfully
suggest
to
your
honors
that
lawyers
in
this
country
will
have
some
pause
into
giving
advise
to
clients.
now,
you
will
notice
that
mr.
mcroberts’
advise
to
his
client,
that
sell
off
enough
of
your
shares
to
get
down
below
the
10%
and
then
you
may
undertake
of
the
9.6%
remainder
provided
as
he
says
in
his
opinion
that
two
steps
are
not
legally
tied
together.
and
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
find
that
the
two
sales
were
not
legally
tied
together.
that
is
they
were
separate
and
distinct
sales.
the
first
sale
of
the
3.2%
was
to
goldman
sachs
separately
negotiated
at
no
time
up
to
that
point
had
there
been
any
talk
with
reliance
whatsoever
about
its
possibly
purchasing
shares.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
we
could
get
our
money
back
if
your
honor
pleases.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes.
we
need
to
get
the
money
(voice
overlap)
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
well,
mr.
justice.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
do
not
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
do
not
conceive
of
that
if
your
honor
pleases,
it
is
true
that
if
section
--
if
the
exemption
provision
of
16
(b)
applies
here
that
the
difference
between
what
we
paid
and
what
we
received
less
whatever
expenses
there
were
which
were
substantial
would
represent
a
profit,
that
is
so.
but
the
issue
is
does
that
come
within
16(b)?
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
no,
we
could
not
get
out
anytime
if
your
honor
pleases
because
we
were
faced
with
the
merger
of
dodge
into
reliance.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
immediately
after
the
letter,
yes.
yes
if
your
honor
pleases
but
if
we
had
unloaded
it
in
the
sense
that
we
had
sold
all
of
it
at
one
time
without
first
getting
down
below
the
10%
which
we
say
the
statute
permits
and
contemplates
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
we
could
not.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
under
the
harsh
provision
of
16
(b).
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes
justice
stewart.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
mr.
justice,
that
is
not
an
issue
open
any
longer
on
the
part
of
emerson
in
this
case.
that
is,
that
on
the
record
in
this
case
and
the
decision
of
the
eighth
circuit,
there
was
no
cross
appeal
from
that
decision
of
the
court.
it
is
so
that
the
profit
made
on
the
first
is
payable
to
reliance.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
--
that
there
may
by
reason
of
16
(b).
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
you
said
reliance,
you
meant,
i
think
you
meant
the
dodge
show
(inaudible)
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes.
if
you
are
correct
on
that.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
your
honor
is
referring
to
the
first
purchase
issue
upon
what
is
there
in
the
amicus
curia,
i
believe
and
on
this
record
as
far
as
emerson
is
concerned,
that
issue
was
not
open
either.
i
have
my
personal
views
on
the
subject
matter
and
that
issue
has
not
yet
come
before
this
court.
and
i
assume
what
will
someday,
i
must
--
i
do
wish
to
say
to
all
of
your
honors
that
i
am
also
counsel
for
golf
and
western
(ph)
in
chicago
and
in
case
before
judge
parsons,
in
which
that
issue
is
presented
and
well,
i
assume
reach
this
court
someday
on
full
briefing.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
the
amicus
brief
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
think
all
parties
feel
that
way.
that
this
court
on
a
very
limited
briefing
on
these
amicus
briefs
will
not
have
the
full
judgment
on
help
of
counsel.
but
we
can
conceive
then
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
and
if
your
honors
do
determine
and
i
ask
your
honors,
determine
to
go
into
that
issue
then
we
would
very
much
wish
--
all
parties
would
wish
the
opportunity
to
brief
that
question
for
your
honors.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
mr.
justice
blackmun,
there
are
situations
in
which
that
is
possible
but
not
here
because
the
purchase
on
the
tender
offer
was
of
all
155,000
shares,
whatever
that
exact
number
is
the
same
day.
so
there
is
no
step
of
opportunity
presented
here.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
sixty-three
dollars
on
every
share.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
on
a
hypothetical,
yes
your
honor.
there
is
some
dispute
in
the
cases.
that
as
you
acquire
say
a
hundred
shares
the
first
of
the
month,
a
hundred
shares
at
the
end
of
the
month
or
along
in
that
area,
may
you
choose
if
you
still
have
the
certificates
that
you
have
not
turned
in
all
the
certificates
to
get
one
certificate,
may
you
sell
off
the
first
hundred
at
the
end
of
six
months
even
though
at
that
time
the
remaining
shares
that
you
have
exceed,
the
10%
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
absolutely.
the
majority
view
is
that
you
--
if
you
match
certificates
even
though
you
have
otherwise
10%
or
more
that
the
sale
of
the
want
--
of
the
certificate
that
is
more
than
six
months
old
does
not
involved
you
in
10
(b).
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
if
your
honor
pleases,
i
thought
somebody
last
night
that
somebody
would
ask
that
question
and
i
had
determined
it
to
answer
it
in
this
way
of
i
may.
i
have
a
problem,
first
problem
is
there
is
a
rule
that
courts
do
not
deal
in
fractions
of
a
day.
and
if
that
rule
should
be
applied,
so
that
the
court
would
say
the
fact
that
you
sold
a
hundred
shares
in
the
morning
and
a
hundred
shares
in
the
afternoon,
we
cannot
recognize
because
we
do
not
recognize
fractions
of
the
day.
then,
i
would
have
to
say
that
the
odds
are
that
we
would
--
that
would
come
with
the
--
all
sales
would
come
within
16
(b).
on
the
other
hand,
it
is
my
view
and
i
urge
it
upon
your
honors
that
since
that
congress
said
that
if
at
the
time
of
a
sale,
you
are
not
a
10%
or
more
shareholder
that
congress
contemplated
even
though
courts
do
not
contemplate
fractions
of
the
day,
that
congress
contemplate
that
if
you
got
yourself
down
below
10%
then
your
second
sale
or
any
number
of
sales
subsequently
the
same
day
would
not
come
within
16
(b).
and
may
i
suggest
to
your
honor
please,
that
is
issue
in
this
case.
what
did
congress
intend
when
it
said,
and
i
will
read
through
the
section,
this
subsection
shall
not
be
construed,
not
be
construed
by
any
court
to
cover
any
transaction
where
such
beneficial
owner,
that
is
an
owner
of
10%
or
more
was
not,
was
not
such,
that
is
the
holder
of
10%
or
more
both
at
the
time
of
the
purchase
and
sale.
time
of
purchase
and
sale
or
the
sale
and
purchase
of
the
security
involved.
now,
that
is
what
congress
said
and
i
respectfully
submit
to
your
honors
that
what
both
the
sec
in
this
case
and
what
my
brother
mulligan
is
urging
upon
your
honors
is
to
rewrite
the
exemption
provision
of
16
(b)
as
congress
ruled
it.
it
is
an
artificial,
for
the
whole
16
(b)
is
artificial.
i
do
not
rail
against
this
section.
i
agree
with
the
purposes
that
congress
had
mind
but
mr.
mulligan
and
the
sec
are
inclined
to
overlook
this.
what
does
this
section
say
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
the
unfair
use
of
information
which
may,
which
may
have
been
obtained
by
such
beneficial
owner?
but
beneficial
owner
is
described
in
16
(a)
as
being
merely
an
owner
of
10%
or
more,
information
which
may
have
been
obtained
by
such
beneficial
owner
by
reason
of
his
relationship
to
the
issuer.
that
is
plain
simple
common
english
and
that
is
what
congress
intended.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
very
much
so.
and
your
honor
and
when
you
wrote
the
opinion
for
the
court
in
the
second
circuit,
in
the
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
blau.
that
is
precisely
what
you
said
and
when
mr.
justice
stewart
wrote
the
opinion
for
the
sixth
circuit
in
the
--
farrelio
(ph)
case,
he
also
said
it.
and
now
may
i
turn
to
a
very
recent
case
decided
and
written
by
one
of
the
unanimous
court
by
chief
judge
finley.
now
i
close
my
argument
by
referring
to
that
case,
it
is
so
recent.
that
is
not
yet
in
the
report.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
it
is
cited
in
the
reply
brief
of
mr.
mulligan.
when
we
filed
our
brief
that
case
was
not
there.
this
is
as
parallel
a
case.
when
we
were
in
law
school,
we
talked
about
the
cow
(ph)
cases.
so
this
is
a
cow
(ph)
case.
this
involved
kern
county
land
company
and
occidental
petroleum.
occidental
petroleum
started
out
negotiating
for
a
merger
of
kern
county
land
into
occidental
petroleum.
just
as
emerson
negotiated
with
dodge
to
--
for
a
gentleman’s
agreement
merger
of
dodge
into
emerson.
that
failed
as
did
the
emerson
situation.
when
the
negations
failed
occidental
made
a
tender
offer
to
the
shareholders
of
kern
county
land.
at
20
dollars
the
above
the
market,
ours
was
18
above
the
market,
kern
reacted
just
as
dodge
reacted.
kern
went
to
tenneco
and
arranged
a
defensive
merger
of
kern
into
tenneco
--
the
mechanism
was
to
organize
a
new
company
and
merge
both
companies
in
to
the
new
company.
but
the
effect
was
the
same.
this
person
stocked
up
in
value,
as
to
the
stock
went
in
value
here
in
dodge.
now
also
kern
resisted,
just
as
dodge
resisted
to
all
kinds
of
injunction
suits
and
the
sort
of
thing
that
we
had
a
hearing,
which
i
was
so
unsuccessful
in
the
northern
district
of
indiana.
successful
only
on
one
if
i
got
to
stockholder's
list.
and
defeated
in
an
injunction
but
the
defensive
merger
came
along
then
that
was
in
exchange
of
shares,
that
is
convertible
preferred
for
the
shares
of
kern
county
land.
now,
how
did
occidental
meet
this
problem
as
judge,
chief
judge
finley
says
there
was
the
danger
of
the
merger
going
through
and
then
occidental
under
the
cases
this
court
had
decided,
that
is
the
second
circuit
that
that
would
have
constituted
a
sale
by
occidental
of
the
shares
of
kern
county
land
it
had
obtained
on
this
tender
offer.
now
the
way
they
sought
to
solve
the
problem
instead
of
as
i
--
because
the
figures
were
so
greater,
millions
and
millions
of
dollars
involved.
their
counsel
resorted
to
an
option.
that
is
an
option
to
the
new
kern
county
land,
new
company
land
coming
in
to
existence
to
purchase
the
tender
offer
shares,
one
day
after
the
six
month
period
and
that
was
attacked
as
they
device
scheme
says
my
brother
mulligan.
and
chief
judge
finley
for
a
unanimous
court
holds
otherwise
and
follows
and
refers
directly
to
both
your
opinion
chief
justice
burger
and
yours
as
well
justice
stewart
as
justifying
the
right
to
use
a
solid
option
provision
to
avoid
not
evade
but
to
avoid
the
harshness
of
16
(b).
so
the
case
is
very
parallel
to
this
and
chief
judge
finley
said
this.
some
decisions
of
this
court
reflect
at
least
in
the
dictum,
they
believe
that
this
principle
should
be
applied
across
the
board
even
to
situations
that
congress
scarcely
considered
the
high
water
mark
of
this
rather
simplistic
approach
was
the
statement
in
park
&
tilford
inc.
versus
schulte,
skipping
the
citation
the
case
of
the
sale
of
common
stock
within
six
months
of
an
economically
compelled
conversion
of
long
held
preferred
in
decoma
(ph).
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes
it
was.
of
the
late
judge
clark,
right.
defendants
did
not
own
the
common
stock
in
question
before
they
exercised
their
option
to
convert.
they
did
afterward
therefore
they
acquired
the
stock
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
that
was
what
chief
judge
finley
says,
it
is
a
simplistic
approach.
however,
that
mechanistic
view
did
not
long
persist
even
in
our
own
court.
see
roberts
versus
seetan
(ph),
certiorari
denied.
then
he
says
a
revolt
against
it
elsewhere
was
begun
by
the
opinion
of
judge
stewart
as
he
then
was
in
ferraiolo
versus
newman,
citing
it
which
was
later
followed
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
blau
versus
max
factor
which
was
so.
the
problem
was
then
given
thorough
consideration
in
the
blau
case
and
then
by
this
court
in
the
blau
case
that
versus
the
lehman
brothers.

so

your
honor.
may
well
be
upheld
--
and
the
district
court
citation,
it
is
at
page
6
of
the
reply
brief
of
my
brother
mulligan.
they
conclude
if
your
honor
pleases,
your
honors
please.
this
is
a
harsh
statute
in
its
result,
it
has
the
obvious
flair
of
duty
in
effect.
but
it
should
not
be
applied
beyond
what
congress
intended
be
applied
and
you
are
being
urged
by
the
sec
counsel,
by
mr.
mulligan
to
extend
it,
to
restrict
it
by
construction
in
the
face
of
expressed
wording
of
the
congress
that
this
shall
not
be
construed
to
extent
beyond
particular
limits.
and
so
with
the
statute
that
this
is
artificial
and
mechanistic
as
this
one,
to
be
applied
in
this
results
then
i
suggest
to
you
the
most,
it
is
to
the
right
of
those
who
would
be
affected
by
the
statute
to
work
out,
if
it
is
possible
an
honorable
means
of
avoiding
the
harsh
results
of
the
statute.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
think
i
am
if
your
honor
pleases.
as
long
as
that
response
is
honorable
and
i
would
respectfully
submit
this
was
a
fully
honorable
response
and
reaches
equity.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
think
so
your
honor.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
i
am
troubled
by
both
arguments
because
neither
argument
presents
my
little
case
before
this
court
and
all
i
am
seeking
is
to
have
the
court
decide
my
case
and
not
decide
other
cases.
by
a
parade
of
horribles
or
otherwise,
by
mr.
mulligan,
a
distinguish
lawyer
from
cleveland
seeking
to
retain
for
his
client,
who
participated
in
the
purchase
of
the
sales,
the
profit
reselling
from
their
purchase
of
these
--
the
stock
from
reliance.
and
may
i
in
the
few
minutes
this
afternoon,
i
would
like
to
devote
if
i
may
to
stating
the
facts
of
this
case
as
mr.
justice
stewart
said,
the
case
in
1958
when
he
wrote
the
opinion
for
the
unanimous
court,
that
if
the
trend
has
come
to
be
as
you,
mr.
chief
justice
had
indicated
when
you
wrote
the
opinion
as
the
circuit
justice
of
the
second
circuit
is
to
examine
the
facts
in
each
case
and
decide
each
case.
now,
before
i
state
the
facts
in
this
case
which
were
relayed
directly
mr.
justice
blackmun
to
one
of
the
inquires
you
made
as
to
whether
or
not
in
fact
emerson
had
any
inside
information
of
any
kind
of
character
at
all
to
which
mr.
mulligan
did
not
give
you
a
correct
answer
or
according
to
the
record
in
which
there
is
a
direct
finding
in
the
case
in
which
dodge
brought
suit
against
emerson.
in
which
district
judge
grant
held
in
the
case
that
i
tried
and
represented
emerson
that
emerson
not
only
had
no
inside
information
but
no
possibility
of
obtaining
inside
information.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
you
are
absolutely
correct
mr.
chief
justice,
but
counsel
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
that
is
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
but
in
those
who
seek
to
argue
the
meaning
of
this
and
i
may
say
harsh
statute.
they
turn
at
times
to
intend
when
an
argument
of
an
intent
will
favor
them.
and
they
turn
to
the
artificiality
of
the
statute
that
is
a
presumed
fiduciary
relationships
because
of
a
holding
of
a
10%
or
more.
but
when
that
does
not
suit
the
attempt
to
induce
a
court
to
interpret
this
narrow
language
then
they
adopt
a
different.
now,
if
your
honors
please,
have
this
in
mind
overnight.
emerson
electric
on
the
22
of
may
1967
made
a
tender
offer
for
the
purchase
of
the
shares
of
dodge
manufacturing
company
of
mishawaka,
indiana
near
south
bend.
prior
to
the
time
that
they
made
that
tender
offer,
they
had
negotiated
with
the
officers
and
directors
of
dodge
manufacturing
company
in
the
hope
that
they
could
arrange
a
merger
with
dodge
and
emerson.
those
discussions
came
of
not
and
when
those
discussions
did
end
is
when
emerson
electric
made
a
tender
offer
from
the
shares
of
dodge
manufacturing
company.
the
original
tender
exercise
date
was
june
2,
1967.
as
soon
as
it
became
known,
we
announced
necessarily
on
a
tender
offer
you
cannot
reach
shareholders
so
you
publish
in
newspapers
and
wall
street
journals.
when
it
became
known
to
the
dodge
managers
of
that
company
that
we
had
submitted
a
tender
offer
for
the
shares
of
dodge
at
a
very
substantial
increase
over
the
then
price,
as
a
matter
of
fact
$20
per
share,
the
dodge
management
immediately
contacted
all
its
shareholders
immediately
and
said
to
them,
do
not
tender
your
share.
two
days
later,
the
dodge
management
then
entered
into
a
negotiations
with
reliance
for
a
defensive
merger
to
defeat
the
tender
offer.
that
is
to
have
the
shareholders
of
dodge
approve
a
merger
of
dodge
into
reliance
and
that
would
destroy
the
tender
offer.
and
that
was
announced
to
its
shareholders
immediately
and
they
were
urged
in
favor
to
consider
the
defense
of
merger
that
was
tendered.
in
addition
to
that,
dodge
filed
suit
in
a
northern
district
of
indiana
before
his
honor,
judge
grant,
to
enjoin
emerson
from
proceeding
with
its
tender
offer
claiming
that
emerson
had
obtained
confidential
information
from
dodge
during
the
course
of
the
attempts
of
emerson
to
interest
dodge
management
in
a
merger
of
dodge
into
emerson.
and
it
charged
in
that
complaint
under
section
10
(b)
and
regulation
10
(b)
(5)
of
the
securities
and
exchange
act.
that
emerson
had
obtained
confidential
information
during
the
course
of
the
discussions
with
dodge
management
on
the
subject
matter
for
possible
merger
of
dodge
into
emerson.
it
was
in
that
case
that
i
represented
emerson
and
tried
the
case.
it
was
tried
before
judge
grant.
and
after
an
extend
of
hearing
with
a
lot
of
proof
taken,
judge
grant
held
expressly
that
emerson
had
acted
in
good
faith
throughout
and
had
never
obtained
any
confidential
information
of
any
kind
or
dirt
that
what
it
had
obtained
by
way
of
information
was
in
14
case,
10
case,
other
matters
public
with
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
once
they
could
examine
annual
reports
and
matters
of
that
character.
and
so
judge
grant
vacated
the
temporary
restraining
order
that
he
had
entered
against
emerson
restraining
up
from
proceeding
with
this
tender
offer.
and
we
extended
that
tender
offer
to
june
2,
1967
with
the
approval
of
judge
grant.
now,
we
were
faced
to
that
particular
time
with
the
defensive
merger
suggested
by
dodge
to
merge
dodge
into
emerson
and
so
at
that
point,
we
proposed
as
a
accountable
that
we
would
submit
to
the
shareholders
of
dodge
a
proposal
for
merger
of
dodge
and
emerson
in
which
we
would
exchange
convertible
preferred
shares
of
emerson
for
dodge
stock
as
reliance
has
--
was
proposing
to
give
to
the
dodge
shareholders
convertible
preferred
shares
for
dodge
stock
except
that
we
claimed
by
publication
otherwise
that
our
merger
offer
was
more
advantageous
of
the
shareholders
of
dodge
than
the
reliance.
and
we
made
a
demand
on
the
management
of
dodge
that
they
submit
the
emerson
proposed
merger
to
the
shareholders
of
dodge
which
the
man
has
run
on
directors
of
dodge
refused
to
do.
also,
we
demand
that
a
right
to
see
--
to
have
a
shareholders
list
so
we
can
communicate
with
the
shareholders
of
dodge.
management
refused
to
give
us
that
list.
we
filed
suit
in
the
superior
court
of
whatever
that
county
is
in
northern
indiana
and
we
--
that
is
the
only
way
we
were
able
to
get
a
shareholder’s
list
then
we
got.
then
we
filed
suit
when
management
refused
to
submit
the
emerson
merger
proposal
to
the
dodge
shareholders
and
we
could
not
get
it
to
them
for
a
vote.
we
then
decided
we
would
go
ahead
with
the
proxy
fight
to
see
if
we
could
defeat
the
merger
of
dodge
into
emerson.
and
emerson
turned
or
dodge
turned
around
and
sued
us
to
enjoin
us
as
submitting
our
merger
proposal
of
merger
of
dodge
into
emerson.
i
believe
all
these
with
you
up
to
this
point
to
show
that
it
was
impossible
for
anybody
to
get
any
confidential
information
of
any
kind
or
character
and
that
judge
grant
held
expressly
that
we
had
not
obtained
them.
now,
the
proposal
for
the
merger
of
dodge
into
reliance
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
think
it
is.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
apologize,
i
seem
to
suffered
a
cold
overnight
and
i
may
have
a
little
problem
with
my
voice.
i
was
concluding
yesterday,
i
was
reciting
the
facts
applicable
here
regarding
primarily
upon
the
question
of
whether,
not
only
whether
the
emerson
had
inside
information
but
whether
it
was
humanly
possible
for
emerson
to
obtain
inside
information,
let
alone
abuse
the
inside
information
if
they
have
obtained
any.
i
reached
the
point
in
which
i
had
stated
to
the
court.
this
appears
in
my
record.
that
when
emerson
made
a
counter
merger
offer
to
meet
reliance’s
and
dodge’s
merger
offer.
emerson
then
launched
into
a
proxy
contest
to
solicit
proxies
to
double
purpose.
for
the
purpose
of
defeating
the
proposed
merger
of
dodge
into
reliance
at
the
special
circle
this
meeting
that
had
been
called
and
also
to
obtain
proxies
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
a
special
meeting
to
require
the
dodge
board
of
directors
to
submit
to
dodge,
stockholders
the
counter-merger
offer
of
emerson
which
emerson
claimed
was
a
superior
offer
by
way
of
merger
for
the
shareholders
of
dodge
as
against
the
reliance
offer.
in
the
meantime,
as
all
of
you
will
realize
regardless
of
this
case,
these
proceeding
served
the
benefit
of
the
shareholders
of
dodge
very
much
because
the
tender
offer
at
$18.25
above
the
market.
reliance’s,
dodge’s
proposed
merger,
at
still
a
higher
figure
in
the
way
of
shares,
i
remember
that
as
convertible
shares.
and
that
emerson
coming
back
with
another
proposed
merger
of
dodge
in
to
emerson,
that
is
still
a
higher
figure.
the
market
price
for
the
dodge
shares
has
kept
going
up
and
up
and
up.
this
had
nothing
to
do
with
an
inside
information
but
as
this
is
typical
many
times
and
most
of
the
time
of
tender
offers
that
the
market
price
of
shares
of
the
target
company
tends
to
rise
very
materially.
first,
because
the
tender
offer
is
always
at
a
higher
price
than
the
market
at
the
time
it
is
--
the
tender
offer
is
submitted
otherwise,
it
would
not
be
effective.
and
the
counter-merger
by
way
of
it
--
to
defeat
a
tender
offer,
likewise
raises
this
price
of
stock
because
the
merger
proposal
is
always
at
a
still
figure
or
it
would
be
not
be
attractive.
it
appeared
to
mr.
mcroberts,
the
general
counsel
of
emerson,
at
this
point,
that
is
at
the
point
that
emerson
began
to
solicit
proxies
to
defeat
the
merger
of
dodge
into
reliance
and
to
bring
about
consideration
by
shareholders
of
the
emerson
offer
of
merger
of
dodge
into
emerson.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes.
the
tender
offer
shares
were
purchased
on
the
16th
of
june,
so
this
came
after
that
point.
you
are
right
with
that
mr.
justice.
mr.
mcroberts
then
wrote
the
letter
that
my
brother
mulligan
complains
about,
i
think
what
that
somewhat
(inaudible).
and
that
appears
commencing
at
page
36
of
the
record.
and
what
was
mr.
mcroberts’
concern
about?
he
was
concerned
about
first
this,
that
under
the
cases
that
had
been
decided
up
to
that
time,
stella
and
others.
that
if
the
merger
of
dodge
into
reliance
was
approved
at
the
special
shareholders
meeting
called
for
the
22nd
of
august,
that
the
receipt
by
emerson
of
the
conferrable
preferred
shares
of
reliance,
the
surviving
company
in
exchange
for
the
155,000
shares
of
dodge
that
emerson
had
acquired
by
way
of
the
tender
offer
on
june
16th.
we
constitute
a
sale.
and
if
constituting
a
sale
would
under
the
cases
then
bring
emerson
within
at
that
point,
16(b),
and
it
would
require
emerson
then
to
pay
to
reliance,
the
difference
in
value
gained
over
the
price
paid
for
the
tender
offer
shares
which
was
$63.00
a
share
and
the
value
of
the
convertible
preferred
received
in
the
merger
of
dodge
into
emerson.
and
he
so
says,
as
your
honors
will
note,
in
his
letter
of
opinion.
now
it
is
true
that
in
his
letter
of
opinion
where
he
cautioned
emerson
about
this
fact
that
they
were
going
to
--
that
they
had
the
danger
of
being
involuntarily
held
to
have
made
a
sale
of
the
tender
offer
shares
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
merger
of
dodge
into
reliance
had
come
about
by
approval
of
the
shareholders.
and
then
subsequent
approval
of
the
board
of
directors
because
under
the
indiana
statute,
the
approval
of
the
shareholders
of
a
merger
does
not
consummate
that
merger.
the
board
of
directors
must
under
the
indiana
statute
approve
it
and
then
it
becomes
consummated.
so
he
said,
in
his
letter
of
opinion,
this
constitutes
a
danger
and
--
you
should
begin
to
prepare
yourself
to
see
if
you
can
avoid
that
had
a
cosmic
result
where
the
time
company
has
been
preventing
you
from
obtaining
information,
preventing
you
reaching
its
shareholders
and
doing
everything
it
can
to
lock
you
out
and
to
cut
off
all
communication.
still
you
are
running
to
the
ironical
situation
because
of
this
mechanical
simplistic
statute
that
you
may
be
involuntarily
come
within
it
and
you
will
notice
that
at
page
36,
he
does
recite
those
circumstances.
but
he
did
anticipate
also
the
possibility,
your
honors,
as
my
brother
mulligan
had
said
to
your
honors
yesterday
that
perhaps
they
could
sell
if
they
wish
or
desire
or
needed
to
sale
the
tender
offer
shares
acquired
in
the
future.
but
there
was
at
that
time,
if
your
honors
please,
no,
they
had
been
no
negotiations
with
reliance
on
that
score.
reliance
was
resisting
us
and
dodge
was
resisting
us.
there
had
been
no
offer
to
purchase.
there
had
been
--
we
have
not
undertaken
a
negotiator
sale.
counsel
wesmick
(ph)
roberts
was
advising
his
client,
you
are
in
danger.
and
mr.
chief
justice,
when
you
asked
mr.
mulligan
yesterday
what
was
the
only
way?
what
was
the
way
you
could
--
that
emerson,
you
are
out
of
this
situation
and
mr.
mulligan
responded
to
you,
well
all
they
had
to
do
was
wait
until
six
months
or
six
months
and
one
day
from
the
tender
offer
purchase
date,
june
16th,
1967.
but
that
was
not
so
because
mr.
mulligan
overlooks
the
fact
which
mr.
mcroberts
did
appreciate
and
that
is
the
danger
that
when
the
dodge
–
reliance
merger
should
it
be
approved
by
the
shareholders
and
then
by
the
board
of
directors
that
that
would
constitute
a
sale.
and
mr.
mcroberts’
judgment
will
happen
to
be
right
on
that
score
because
the
newmark
case
came
down.
not
long
after
that
in
which
the
second
circuit
so
held.
now
mr.
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes
sir,
under
the
--
and
in
the
newmark
case
in
the
second
quarter
--
the
court
so
held
and
that
was
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
involuntary.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
unless
as
some
of
the
cases
held
and
as
pointed
out
by
mr.
justice
stewart
as
a
sixth
circuit
judge,
the
securities
received
were
--
should
be
the
substantial
equivalent
of
the
security
surrendered,
that
is
in
price
and
in
terms
and
in
effect,
if
they
are
they
are
the
substantial
equivalent
then
the
courts
held
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes,
you
had
first,
mr.
justice
brennan,
you
had
first
of
great
difference
in
price.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
well,
the
difference
is
--
first
we
offered
$63.00,
that
was
$18.25
above
the
market
and
then
the
dodge
--
reliance
securities
were
estimated
to
be
at
a
value
of
around
$76.00
to
$80.00
a
share.
and
the
emerson
management
touted
that
they
had
even
higher
figure.
i
do
not
mean
to
use
the
word
touted
in
any
--
depreciatingly
fashioned.
but
there
was
a
difference
in
value
and
more
important
if
your
honor
pleases,
the
shares
to
be
received
in
the
merger
of
dodge
into
reliance
were
convertible
preferred
shares.
so
at
that
would
give
emerson
another
option
it
would
write
on
the
preferred
until
--
if
the
market
would
be
--
of
the
common
came
offered
would
be
propitious
for
it
to
exercise
that
option.
so
it
was
pretty
clear
that
what
emerson
would
receive
had
it
gone
through
and
waited
till
beyond
the
consummation
of
the
merger
would
necessarily
come
within
what
the
cases
were
then
holding
and
which
newmark
--
in
the
second
circuit
newmark
did
subsequently
hold.
so
at
that
point,
the
man
that
is
one
of
emersons
receiving
this
opinion
of
its
counsel
became
concerned
naturally.
they
still
thought
they
had
the
chance
of
defeating
the
merger.
and
being
successful
on
the
proxy
side,
so
that
is
what
i
have
--
but
the
point
i
want
to
emphasize
is.
it
is
unlike
mr.
mulligan’s
representation
to
your
honors
yesterday.
he
used
the
word
scheme
that
on
the
advise
of
its
counsel,
the
management
of
emerson’s
scheme
to
try
and
avoid
the
harsh
results
of
16
(b)
by
reducing
by
one
sale,
the
percentage
of
its
shares
in
dodge
from
13.2
to
9.96.
now,
if
the
advise
of
counsel,
reading
the
authorities,
subsequent
confirmed
in
his
urge
constitutes
a
scheme
in
the
sense
that
it
is
invidious
and
odious,
where
we
are
going
with
that.
but
it
was
advise
of
counsel
and
if
section
16
(b)
is
to
construed
by
this
court
that
if
--
because
counsel
advises
the
client
of
a
problem
and
suggests
a
possible
solution
of
it
that
that
is
a
plan
or
scheme
for
which
the
client
is
to
be
punished,
then
i
respectfully
suggest
to
your
honors
that
lawyers
in
this
country
will
have
some
pause
into
giving
advise
to
clients.
now,
you
will
notice
that
mr.
mcroberts’
advise
to
his
client,
that
sell
off
enough
of
your
shares
to
get
down
below
the
10%
and
then
you
may
undertake
of
the
9.6%
remainder
provided
as
he
says
in
his
opinion
that
two
steps
are
not
legally
tied
together.
and
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
find
that
the
two
sales
were
not
legally
tied
together.
that
is
they
were
separate
and
distinct
sales.
the
first
sale
of
the
3.2%
was
to
goldman
sachs
separately
negotiated
at
no
time
up
to
that
point
had
there
been
any
talk
with
reliance
whatsoever
about
its
possibly
purchasing
shares.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
we
could
get
our
money
back
if
your
honor
pleases.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes.
we
need
to
get
the
money
(voice
overlap)
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
well,
mr.
justice.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
do
not
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
do
not
conceive
of
that
if
your
honor
pleases,
it
is
true
that
if
section
--
if
the
exemption
provision
of
16
(b)
applies
here
that
the
difference
between
what
we
paid
and
what
we
received
less
whatever
expenses
there
were
which
were
substantial
would
represent
a
profit,
that
is
so.
but
the
issue
is
does
that
come
within
16(b)?
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
no,
we
could
not
get
out
anytime
if
your
honor
pleases
because
we
were
faced
with
the
merger
of
dodge
into
reliance.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
immediately
after
the
letter,
yes.
yes
if
your
honor
pleases
but
if
we
had
unloaded
it
in
the
sense
that
we
had
sold
all
of
it
at
one
time
without
first
getting
down
below
the
10%
which
we
say
the
statute
permits
and
contemplates
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
we
could
not.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
under
the
harsh
provision
of
16
(b).
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes
justice
stewart.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
mr.
justice,
that
is
not
an
issue
open
any
longer
on
the
part
of
emerson
in
this
case.
that
is,
that
on
the
record
in
this
case
and
the
decision
of
the
eighth
circuit,
there
was
no
cross
appeal
from
that
decision
of
the
court.
it
is
so
that
the
profit
made
on
the
first
is
payable
to
reliance.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
--
that
there
may
by
reason
of
16
(b).
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
you
said
reliance,
you
meant,
i
think
you
meant
the
dodge
show
(inaudible)
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes.
if
you
are
correct
on
that.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
your
honor
is
referring
to
the
first
purchase
issue
upon
what
is
there
in
the
amicus
curia,
i
believe
and
on
this
record
as
far
as
emerson
is
concerned,
that
issue
was
not
open
either.
i
have
my
personal
views
on
the
subject
matter
and
that
issue
has
not
yet
come
before
this
court.
and
i
assume
what
will
someday,
i
must
--
i
do
wish
to
say
to
all
of
your
honors
that
i
am
also
counsel
for
golf
and
western
(ph)
in
chicago
and
in
case
before
judge
parsons,
in
which
that
issue
is
presented
and
well,
i
assume
reach
this
court
someday
on
full
briefing.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
the
amicus
brief
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
think
all
parties
feel
that
way.
that
this
court
on
a
very
limited
briefing
on
these
amicus
briefs
will
not
have
the
full
judgment
on
help
of
counsel.
but
we
can
conceive
then
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
and
if
your
honors
do
determine
and
i
ask
your
honors,
determine
to
go
into
that
issue
then
we
would
very
much
wish
--
all
parties
would
wish
the
opportunity
to
brief
that
question
for
your
honors.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
mr.
justice
blackmun,
there
are
situations
in
which
that
is
possible
but
not
here
because
the
purchase
on
the
tender
offer
was
of
all
155,000
shares,
whatever
that
exact
number
is
the
same
day.
so
there
is
no
step
of
opportunity
presented
here.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
sixty-three
dollars
on
every
share.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
on
a
hypothetical,
yes
your
honor.
there
is
some
dispute
in
the
cases.
that
as
you
acquire
say
a
hundred
shares
the
first
of
the
month,
a
hundred
shares
at
the
end
of
the
month
or
along
in
that
area,
may
you
choose
if
you
still
have
the
certificates
that
you
have
not
turned
in
all
the
certificates
to
get
one
certificate,
may
you
sell
off
the
first
hundred
at
the
end
of
six
months
even
though
at
that
time
the
remaining
shares
that
you
have
exceed,
the
10%
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
absolutely.
the
majority
view
is
that
you
--
if
you
match
certificates
even
though
you
have
otherwise
10%
or
more
that
the
sale
of
the
want
--
of
the
certificate
that
is
more
than
six
months
old
does
not
involved
you
in
10
(b).
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
if
your
honor
pleases,
i
thought
somebody
last
night
that
somebody
would
ask
that
question
and
i
had
determined
it
to
answer
it
in
this
way
of
i
may.
i
have
a
problem,
first
problem
is
there
is
a
rule
that
courts
do
not
deal
in
fractions
of
a
day.
and
if
that
rule
should
be
applied,
so
that
the
court
would
say
the
fact
that
you
sold
a
hundred
shares
in
the
morning
and
a
hundred
shares
in
the
afternoon,
we
cannot
recognize
because
we
do
not
recognize
fractions
of
the
day.
then,
i
would
have
to
say
that
the
odds
are
that
we
would
--
that
would
come
with
the
--
all
sales
would
come
within
16
(b).
on
the
other
hand,
it
is
my
view
and
i
urge
it
upon
your
honors
that
since
that
congress
said
that
if
at
the
time
of
a
sale,
you
are
not
a
10%
or
more
shareholder
that
congress
contemplated
even
though
courts
do
not
contemplate
fractions
of
the
day,
that
congress
contemplate
that
if
you
got
yourself
down
below
10%
then
your
second
sale
or
any
number
of
sales
subsequently
the
same
day
would
not
come
within
16
(b).
and
may
i
suggest
to
your
honor
please,
that
is
issue
in
this
case.
what
did
congress
intend
when
it
said,
and
i
will
read
through
the
section,
this
subsection
shall
not
be
construed,
not
be
construed
by
any
court
to
cover
any
transaction
where
such
beneficial
owner,
that
is
an
owner
of
10%
or
more
was
not,
was
not
such,
that
is
the
holder
of
10%
or
more
both
at
the
time
of
the
purchase
and
sale.
time
of
purchase
and
sale
or
the
sale
and
purchase
of
the
security
involved.
now,
that
is
what
congress
said
and
i
respectfully
submit
to
your
honors
that
what
both
the
sec
in
this
case
and
what
my
brother
mulligan
is
urging
upon
your
honors
is
to
rewrite
the
exemption
provision
of
16
(b)
as
congress
ruled
it.
it
is
an
artificial,
for
the
whole
16
(b)
is
artificial.
i
do
not
rail
against
this
section.
i
agree
with
the
purposes
that
congress
had
mind
but
mr.
mulligan
and
the
sec
are
inclined
to
overlook
this.
what
does
this
section
say
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
the
unfair
use
of
information
which
may,
which
may
have
been
obtained
by
such
beneficial
owner?
but
beneficial
owner
is
described
in
16
(a)
as
being
merely
an
owner
of
10%
or
more,
information
which
may
have
been
obtained
by
such
beneficial
owner
by
reason
of
his
relationship
to
the
issuer.
that
is
plain
simple
common
english
and
that
is
what
congress
intended.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
very
much
so.
and
your
honor
and
when
you
wrote
the
opinion
for
the
court
in
the
second
circuit,
in
the
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
blau.
that
is
precisely
what
you
said
and
when
mr.
justice
stewart
wrote
the
opinion
for
the
sixth
circuit
in
the
--
farrelio
(ph)
case,
he
also
said
it.
and
now
may
i
turn
to
a
very
recent
case
decided
and
written
by
one
of
the
unanimous
court
by
chief
judge
finley.
now
i
close
my
argument
by
referring
to
that
case,
it
is
so
recent.
that
is
not
yet
in
the
report.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
it
is
cited
in
the
reply
brief
of
mr.
mulligan.
when
we
filed
our
brief
that
case
was
not
there.
this
is
as
parallel
a
case.
when
we
were
in
law
school,
we
talked
about
the
cow
(ph)
cases.
so
this
is
a
cow
(ph)
case.
this
involved
kern
county
land
company
and
occidental
petroleum.
occidental
petroleum
started
out
negotiating
for
a
merger
of
kern
county
land
into
occidental
petroleum.
just
as
emerson
negotiated
with
dodge
to
--
for
a
gentleman’s
agreement
merger
of
dodge
into
emerson.
that
failed
as
did
the
emerson
situation.
when
the
negations
failed
occidental
made
a
tender
offer
to
the
shareholders
of
kern
county
land.
at
20
dollars
the
above
the
market,
ours
was
18
above
the
market,
kern
reacted
just
as
dodge
reacted.
kern
went
to
tenneco
and
arranged
a
defensive
merger
of
kern
into
tenneco
--
the
mechanism
was
to
organize
a
new
company
and
merge
both
companies
in
to
the
new
company.
but
the
effect
was
the
same.
this
person
stocked
up
in
value,
as
to
the
stock
went
in
value
here
in
dodge.
now
also
kern
resisted,
just
as
dodge
resisted
to
all
kinds
of
injunction
suits
and
the
sort
of
thing
that
we
had
a
hearing,
which
i
was
so
unsuccessful
in
the
northern
district
of
indiana.
successful
only
on
one
if
i
got
to
stockholder's
list.
and
defeated
in
an
injunction
but
the
defensive
merger
came
along
then
that
was
in
exchange
of
shares,
that
is
convertible
preferred
for
the
shares
of
kern
county
land.
now,
how
did
occidental
meet
this
problem
as
judge,
chief
judge
finley
says
there
was
the
danger
of
the
merger
going
through
and
then
occidental
under
the
cases
this
court
had
decided,
that
is
the
second
circuit
that
that
would
have
constituted
a
sale
by
occidental
of
the
shares
of
kern
county
land
it
had
obtained
on
this
tender
offer.
now
the
way
they
sought
to
solve
the
problem
instead
of
as
i
--
because
the
figures
were
so
greater,
millions
and
millions
of
dollars
involved.
their
counsel
resorted
to
an
option.
that
is
an
option
to
the
new
kern
county
land,
new
company
land
coming
in
to
existence
to
purchase
the
tender
offer
shares,
one
day
after
the
six
month
period
and
that
was
attacked
as
they
device
scheme
says
my
brother
mulligan.
and
chief
judge
finley
for
a
unanimous
court
holds
otherwise
and
follows
and
refers
directly
to
both
your
opinion
chief
justice
burger
and
yours
as
well
justice
stewart
as
justifying
the
right
to
use
a
solid
option
provision
to
avoid
not
evade
but
to
avoid
the
harshness
of
16
(b).
so
the
case
is
very
parallel
to
this
and
chief
judge
finley
said
this.
some
decisions
of
this
court
reflect
at
least
in
the
dictum,
they
believe
that
this
principle
should
be
applied
across
the
board
even
to
situations
that
congress
scarcely
considered
the
high
water
mark
of
this
rather
simplistic
approach
was
the
statement
in
park
&
tilford
inc.
versus
schulte,
skipping
the
citation
the
case
of
the
sale
of
common
stock
within
six
months
of
an
economically
compelled
conversion
of
long
held
preferred
in
decoma
(ph).
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes
it
was.
of
the
late
judge
clark,
right.
defendants
did
not
own
the
common
stock
in
question
before
they
exercised
their
option
to
convert.
they
did
afterward
therefore
they
acquired
the
stock
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
that
was
what
chief
judge
finley
says,
it
is
a
simplistic
approach.
however,
that
mechanistic
view
did
not
long
persist
even
in
our
own
court.
see
roberts
versus
seetan
(ph),
certiorari
denied.
then
he
says
a
revolt
against
it
elsewhere
was
begun
by
the
opinion
of
judge
stewart
as
he
then
was
in
ferraiolo
versus
newman,
citing
it
which
was
later
followed
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
blau
versus
max
factor
which
was
so.
the
problem
was
then
given
thorough
consideration
in
the
blau
case
and
then
by
this
court
in
the
blau
case
that
versus
the
lehman
brothers.

so

conclude
if

your

please.
this
is
a
harsh
statute
in
its
result,
it
has
the
obvious
flair
of
duty
in
effect.
but
it
should
not
be
applied
beyond
what
congress
intended
be
applied
and
you
are
being
urged
by
the
sec
counsel,
by
mr.
mulligan
to
extend
it,
to
restrict
it
by
construction
in
the
face
of
expressed
wording
of
the
congress
that
this
shall
not
be
construed
to
extent
beyond
particular
limits.
and
so
with
the
statute
that
this
is
artificial
and
mechanistic
as
this
one,
to
be
applied
in
this
results
then
i
suggest
to
you
the
most,
it
is
to
the
right
of
those
who
would
be
affected
by
the
statute
to
work
out,
if
it
is
possible
an
honorable
means
of
avoiding
the
harsh
results
of
the
statute.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
think
i
am
if
your
honor
pleases.
as
long
as
that
response
is
honorable
and
i
would
respectfully
submit
this
was
a
fully
honorable
response
and
reaches
equity.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
think
so
your
honor.
