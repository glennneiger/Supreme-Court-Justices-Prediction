mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
the
commission
is
appreciative
of
the
opportunity
to
participate
in
today’s
oral
argument
even
though
it
is
only
in
the
case
on
the
amicus
basis.
and
that
one
reason
why
we
feel
that
way,
particularly
in
this
case
is
because
while
we
agree
with
the
result
for
which
the
petitioner
argues,
we
would
put
it
on
a
little
different
ground
than
at
least
to
one
that
most
of
the
oral
argument
has
been
devoted
too
though
i
think
petitioner
also
agrees
with
our
somewhat
broader
view
of
it.
mr.
walter
p.

how
is
that?
mr.
walter
p.
north
we
agree
that
his
interpretation
is
one
method
of
disposing
of
this
case
in
his
favor.
in
other
words,
his
client
would
get
the
same
$600,000
or
$700,000
no
matter
on
which
theory
he
has
decided
on.
mr.

that
is
right
and
we
do
not
--
mr.
walter
p.

it
is,
but
we
do
not
--
mr.
walter
p.
north
we
do
not
think
the
case
on
it
turn
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
is
an
advance
scheme
which
ties
these
two
separate
sales
all
in
the
one
or
not.
the
claimant
--
mr.
walter

north
that
plus
the
fact
that
from
then
on,
you
would
never
have
another
case
that
had
this
kind
of
fact,
the
general
counsel
would
not
write
the
company
a
letter
and
then
propose
that
you
hook
up
this
kind
of
a
scheme.
then
that
will
never
occur
again
if
he
decided
on
that
ground.
in
other
words,
the
commission
feels
that
the
case
ought
to
be
decided
on
the
broader
ground
that
a
--
mr.
walter

how
then?
mr.
walter
p.

we
feel,
just
as
the
questions
from
the
chief
justice
indicate
that
there
are
some
weaknesses
in
putting
it
on
the
grounds
or
whether
there
was
a
scheme
or
a
plan
or
not
because
that
might
fit
in
with
some
other
arguments
about
whether
the
six
months
period
was

mr.
walter

we
--
mr.
walter

i
am
not
quite
sure
that
i
understand
the
difference
between
that.
mr.
walter
p.

those
are
both
subheadings
under
our
general
proposition
that
neither
the
purpose
nor
the
language
of
the
section
were
not
excluding
transactions
such
as
this
from
the
operation
of
the
statute.
now,
those
are
part
and
parcel
of
our
overall
argument
to
the
effect
--
mr.
walter
p.
north
no,
i
would
not
think
so
your
honor.
in
the
first
place
we
are
pointing
out
that
the
exemption
provision
was
not
intended
to
preclude
liability
from
profits
made
on
transaction
within
the
six
months
period
by
a
10%
provision
of
beneficial
owner
who
acquires
such
status
by
voluntary
purchase.
then
the
others,
it
seems
to
me
follows
along
as
a
part
of
the
same
argument
namely
that
their
language
is
not
exemptive
provision
does
not
run
contrary
to
that.
mr.
walter
p.
north
mr.
justice
what
--
mr.
walter
p.
north
i
think
mr.
justice
white
that
the
difference
is
this
that
we
feel
that
the
purpose
of
congress
in
putting
in
this
provision
about
the
--
at
the
time
of
both
the
purchase
and
the
sale,
then
the
purpose
of
putting
that
in
there
was
to
protect
against
liability
and
in
involuntary
situations.
in
other
words,
if
a
man
already
owns
8%
and
then
he
inherits
or
he
made
a
present
of
another
3
or
4%,
he
has
become
a
10%
owner
by
virtue
of
purchases.
mr.
walter
p.
north
that
is
right.
but
then
we
sale
--
we
say
that
the
thing
you
should
max
that
against
is
not
just
one
stage
of
a
two
or
three
or
four
stage
sales
transaction.
mr.
walter
p.
north
assuming
that
all
of
these
acquisitions
are
by
purchase,
then
you
do
have
to
get
to
that.
mr.
walter
p.
north
the
only
time
he
do
not
get
to
that
is
when
his
acquisitions
are
by
some
means
other
than
a
purchase.
otherwise,
you
have
got
to
analyze
the
sale
end
of
the
transaction
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
is
liability.
mr.
walter
p.
north
that
is
right.
mr.
walter
p.
north
that
is
right.
mr.
walter
p.
north
the
only
reason
we
mentioned,
make
any
point
about
involuntary
acquisition
is
to
show
what
we
think
was
the
congressional
reason
for
putting
that
provision
in
there
about
the
--
at
the
time
of
both
the
purchase
and
the
sale.
in
other
words,
we
think
that
the
so-called
exemptive
language
or
the
provision
that
says
it
shall
not
apply
except
under
the
condition
set
forth.
we
think
that
that
provision
was
put
in
there
for
purposes
of
protecting
against
involuntary
situations
and
should
not
be
construed
so
narrowly
as
to
permit
a
two
step
or
three
step
or
four
step
sale.
all
of
which
steps
occur
within
six
months
regardless
of
whether
it
was
with
respect
to
a
predetermined
plan
or
was
not
respect
to
a
predetermined
plan.
and
we
do
not
believe
that
that
does
any
violence
to
the
language
of
the
statute.
now,
the
respondents
continuously
insist
on
saying
that
that
does
not
comport
with
the
literal
language
of
the
statute.
but
as
we
all
know
in
situations
of
this
kind,
the
literal
language
of
the
statute
is
not
necessary
the
controlling
factor,
in
fact
is
generally
not
to
controlling
factor.
the
controlling
factor
is
the
congress.
mr.
walter
p.
north
it
is
certainly
true.
mr.
walter
p.
north
it
is
certainly
true
that
it
has
been
said
time
and
again
that
the
whole
16
(b)
concept
is
one
that
has
arbitrary
limitations
and
there
is
a
mechanical
or
mechanistic
application
of
a
hard
and
fast
rule.
but
in
determining
whether
there
has
been
a
purchase
or
there
has
been
a
sale
or
the
aspects
of
the
thing
that
our
subject
to
interpretation
other
as
against
the
arbitrary
limitations,
the
court
just
said
repeatedly,
this
is
a
remedial
statute
and
should
be
broadly
and
liberately
construed
to
accomplish
the
purposes
that
congress
had
in
mind
namely
to
prevent
the
types
of
abuses
that
arise
in
connection
with
short
swing
sale
by
insiders.
and
--
mr.
walter
p.
north
that
is
right.
mr.
walter
p.
north
that
is
right.
mr.
walter
p.
north
that
is
right.
mr.
walter
p.
north
that
is
true.
but
as
your
honor
said
in
writing
the
furlow
opinion,
the
sixth
circuit,
the
standards
that
seem
to
emerge
from
decided
cases
are
to
this
effect
and
i
am
quoting
from
that
opinion.
every
transaction
which
can
reasonably
be
defined
as
a
purchase
will
be
so
defined
if
the
transaction
is
of
a
kind
which
can
possibly
amend
itself
to
the
speculation
and
accomplished
by
section
16(b).
and
by
the
same
token
the
courts
have
arrived
at
a
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
a
purchase
or
a
sale
on
that
kind
of
a
test.
it
will
result
--
they
sometimes
call
a
particular
transaction
or
purchase
or
a
sale
and
then
another
case,
the
identical
type
of
transaction
is
not
called
a
purchase
or
a
sale.
now,
to
me
it
is
impossible
to
say
that
you
are
going
by
the
literal
language
of
the
statute,
then
sometimes
you
reach
one
result
and
sometimes
you
reach
another
on
exactly
the
same
kind
of
transaction.
the
whole
thing
to
me
is
in
terms
of,
are
you
accomplishing
the
intent
of
congress
in
adopting
this
broadly
remedial
statute
unless
you
call
it
either
a
purchase
or
a
sale
or
refuse
to
call
it,
the
last
thing
--
mr.
walter
p.
north
i
think
that
is
right.
mr.
walter
p.
north
that
is
right.
from
--
mr.
walter
p.
north
no,
no.
from
page
34
on,
we
are
arguing
what
is
our
construction
of
the
exemptive
language
of
the
statute
namely
--
mr.
walter
p.
north
that
is
right.
mr.
walter
p.
north
no.
the
exemptive
provision
was
not
intended
to
--
mr.
walter
p.
north
no,
that
is
not
the
position.
we
are
saying
it
that
assuming
you
have
got
a
voluntary
purchase
and
not
an
acquisition
that
is
not
by
a
way
of
purchase.
on
the
one
end,
the
purchase
end
then
on
the
sale
end
or
any
sales
within
six
months
should
be
considered
as
a
single
sale
transaction
even
though
if
done
in
step
stages.
but
you
still
got
to
have
sales
within
six
months
of
that
purchase
or
you
are
not
going
to
have
any
16
(b)
liability
in
the
first
place.
mr.
walter
p.
north
that
is
true.
but
i
am
--
and
we--
mr.
walter
p.
north
that
is
right.
if
there
is
many
respects
--
just
you
say
in
which
the
statutes
are
arbitrary,
but
the
courts
have
never
had
much
difficulty
in
reaching
what
they
felt
was
the
right
result
on
a
case
to
case
basis.
for
instances,
this
colby
against
klune
case
that
we
mentioned
here.
you
had
a
person
there
who
was
an
employee
of
the
company
but
he
did
not
bear
any
corporate
official
or
officer’s
title,
he
was
not
the
president
or
the
vice
president
or
anything
of
that
sort.
but
the
court
said,
well
he
might
still
be
an
officer
even
though
he
did
not
bear
an
official
title,
a
corporate
title
of
any
kind.
the
courts
overlooked
the
precise
language
of
the
statute
where
they
feel
that
substance
should
prevail
over
form
and
there
should
be
liability.
if
that
man
is
actually
working
for
the
company
then
the
capacity
where
he
has
that
the
same
access
to
inside
information
as
though
he
were
the
president
of
the
company.
the
court
said,
liability
should
attach.
mr.
walter
p.
north
that
was
before.
it
was
decided
--
mr.
walter
p.
north
yes,
i
think
it
would.
i
think
it
would.
mr.
walter
p.
north
alright,
my
time
is
already
up,
but
if
i
can
do
it
in
three
sentences
no,
i
will
not
run
overtime,
put
a
little
bit.
our
position
is
that
if
you
have
a
voluntary
purchase
that
exceeds
10%
that
then
to
determine
whether
a
16
(b)
liability
or
not,
you
match,
you
add
up
all
the
sales
that
are
made
within
six
months
of
that
purchase
and
the
liability
attaches
to
all
such
sales.
i
do
not
--
mr.
walter
p.
north
well,
we
have
tried
to
state
whether
we
have
done
it
effectively
or
not
and
apparently
or
not,
from
page
34
on
we
have
tried
to
state
why
we
think
that
you
can
read
the
statute
that
way.
now,
if
the
court
decides
you
cannot
read
it
that
way
while
you
have
--
we
just
cannot
prevail
on
that
theory.
that
is
what

the
argument
in
varying
to
me.

shall
not
apply
except
under
the
condition
set
forth.
we
think
that
that
provision
was
put
in
there
for
purposes
of
protecting
against
involuntary
situations
and
should
not
be
construed
so
narrowly
as
to
permit
a
two
step
or
three
step
or
four
step
sale.
all
of
which
steps
occur
within
six
months
regardless
of
whether
it
was
with
respect
to
a
predetermined
plan
or
was
not
respect
to
a
predetermined
plan.
and
we
do
not
believe
that
that
does
any
violence
to
the
language
of
the
statute.
now,
the
respondents
continuously
insist
on
saying
that
that
does
not
comport
with
the
literal
language
of
the
statute.
but
as
we
all
know
in
situations
of
this
kind,
the
literal
language
of
the
statute
is
not
necessary
the
controlling
factor,
in
fact
is
generally
not
to
controlling
factor.
the
controlling
factor
is
the
congress.
mr.
walter
p.
north
it
is
certainly
true.
mr.
walter
p.
north
it
is
certainly
true
that
it
has
been
said
time
and
again
that
the
whole
16
(b)
concept
is
one
that
has
arbitrary
limitations
and
there
is
a
mechanical
or
mechanistic
application
of
a
hard
and
fast
rule.
but
in
determining
whether
there
has
been
a
purchase
or
there
has
been
a
sale
or
the
aspects
of
the
thing
that
our
subject
to
interpretation
other
as
against
the
arbitrary
limitations,
the
court
just
said
repeatedly,
this
is
a
remedial
statute
and
should
be
broadly
and
liberately
construed
to
accomplish
the
purposes
that
congress
had
in
mind
namely
to
prevent
the
types
of
abuses
that
arise
in
connection
with
short
swing
sale
by
insiders.
and
--
mr.
walter
p.
north
that
is
right.
mr.
walter
p.
north
that
is
right.
mr.
walter
p.
north
that
is
right.
mr.
walter
p.
north
that
is
true.
but
as
your
honor
said
in
writing
the
furlow
opinion,
the
sixth
circuit,
the
standards
that
seem
to
emerge
from
decided
cases
are
to
this
effect
and
i
am
quoting
from
that
opinion.
every
transaction
which
can
reasonably
be
defined
as
a
purchase
will
be
so
defined
if
the
transaction
is
of
a
kind
which
can
possibly
amend
itself
to
the
speculation
and
accomplished
by
section
16(b).
and
by
the
same
token
the
courts
have
arrived
at
a
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
a
purchase
or
a
sale
on
that
kind
of
a
test.
it
will
result
--
they
sometimes
call
a
particular
transaction
or
purchase
or
a
sale
and
then
another
case,
the
identical
type
of
transaction
is
not
called
a
purchase
or
a
sale.
now,
to
me
it
is
impossible
to
say
that
you
are
going
by
the
literal
language
of
the
statute,
then
sometimes
you
reach
one
result
and
sometimes
you
reach
another
on
exactly
the
same
kind
of
transaction.
the
whole
thing
to
me
is
in
terms
of,
are
you
accomplishing
the
intent
of
congress
in
adopting
this
broadly
remedial
statute
unless
you
call
it
either
a
purchase
or
a
sale
or
refuse
to
call
it,
the
last
thing
--
mr.
walter
p.
north
i
think
that
is
right.
mr.
walter
p.
north
that
is
right.
from
--
mr.
walter
p.
north
no,
no.
from
page
34
on,
we
are
arguing
what
is
our
construction
of
the
exemptive
language
of
the
statute
namely
--
mr.
walter
p.
north
that
is
right.
mr.
walter
p.
north
no.
the
exemptive
provision
was
not
intended
to
--
mr.
walter
p.
north
no,
that
is
not
the
position.
we
are
saying
it
that
assuming
you
have
got
a
voluntary
purchase
and
not
an
acquisition
that
is
not
by
a
way
of
purchase.
on
the
one
end,
the
purchase
end
then
on
the
sale
end
or
any
sales
within
six
months
should
be
considered
as
a
single
sale
transaction
even
though
if
done
in
step
stages.
but
you
still
got
to
have
sales
within
six
months
of
that
purchase
or
you
are
not
going
to
have
any
16
(b)
liability
in
the
first
place.
mr.
walter
p.
north
that
is
true.
but
i
am
--
and
we--
mr.
walter
p.
north
that
is
right.
if
there
is
many
respects
--
just
you
say
in
which
the
statutes
are
arbitrary,
but
the
courts
have
never
had
much
difficulty
in
reaching
what
they
felt
was
the
right
result
on
a
case
to
case
basis.
for
instances,
this
colby
against
klune
case
that
we
mentioned
here.
you
had
a
person
there
who
was
an
employee
of
the
company
but
he
did
not
bear
any
corporate
official
or
officer’s
title,
he
was
not
the
president
or
the
vice
president
or
anything
of
that
sort.
but
the
court
said,
well
he
might
still
be
an
officer
even
though
he
did
not
bear
an
official
title,
a
corporate
title
of
any
kind.
the
courts
overlooked
the
precise
language
of
the
statute
where
they
feel
that
substance
should
prevail
over
form
and
there
should
be
liability.
if
that
man
is
actually
working
for
the
company
then
the
capacity
where
he
has
that
the
same
access
to
inside
information
as
though
he
were
the
president
of
the
company.
the
court
said,
liability
should
attach.
mr.
walter
p.
north
that
was
before.
it
was
decided
--
mr.
walter
p.
north
yes,
i
think
it
would.
i
think
it
would.
mr.
walter
p.
north
alright,
my
time
is
already
up,
but
if
i
can
do
it
in
three
sentences
no,
i
will
not
run
overtime,
put
a
little
bit.
our
position
is
that
if
you
have
a
voluntary
purchase
that
exceeds
10%
that
then
to
determine
whether
a
16
(b)
liability
or
not,
you
match,
you
add
up
all
the
sales
that
are
made
within
six
months
of
that
purchase
and
the
liability
attaches
to
all
such
sales.
i
do
not
--
mr.
walter
p.
north
well,
we
have
tried
to
state
whether
we
have
done
it
effectively
or
not
and
apparently
or
not,
from
page
34
on
we
have
tried
to
state
why
we
think
that
you
can
read
the
statute
that
way.
now,
if
the
court
decides
you
cannot
read
it
that
way
while
you
have
--
we
just
cannot
prevail
on
that
theory.
that
is
what
--
that
the
argument
in
varying
to
me.
thank
you
very
much.
