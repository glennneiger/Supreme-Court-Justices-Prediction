mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
brings
before
the
court
a
question
involving
section
16(b)
of
the
securities
act
--
securities
exchange
act
of
1934
which
relates
to
short
swing
sales
transactions
involving
directors,
officers
and
10%
holders.
we
are
concerned
here
with
the
position
of
emerson
electric
company.
the
respondent
who
was
what,
has
been
described
as
a
beneficial
owner
under
the
statute
in
that,
it
was
at
the
times
that
are
relevant
in
our
consideration
of
this
question
more
than
a
10%
holder
of
the
common
stock
of
dodge
manufacturing
company
which
was
subsequently
merged
into
reliance
electric
company,
the
petitioner
here
in.
section
16(b)
of
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934,
is
set
out
in
page
2
of
our
brief
and
provides
that
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
the
unfair
use
of
information
which
may
have
been
obtained
by
a
beneficial
owner
or
director
or
officer
by
a
reason
of
his
relationship
with
the
issuer
that
any
profit
realized
by
him
from
the
purchasing
sale
or
sale
in
purchase
within
a
period
of
six
months,
shall
be
recoverable
by
the
issuer.
there
is
in
16
(b)
an
exemption
which
provides,
and
it
is
of
significance
in
this
case
that
the
subsection
shall
not
be
construed
to
cover
any
transaction
where
the
beneficial
owner
or
the
officer
or
director
was
not
such
because
at
the
time
of
the
purchase,
end
of
the
sale
or
the
sale
in
purchase
of
the
security
involved.
this
action
comes
before
the
court
by
a
reason
of
a
declaratory
judgment
which
was
initially
filed
by
emerson
against
reliance
asking
for
a
declaration
of
its
rights
and
obligations
under
section
16(b)
by
reason
of
its,
that
is
emerson’s
ownership
of
more
than
10%
of
the
stock
of
dodge.
briefly,
the
relevant
facts
disclosed
that
on
june
16,
1967
pursuant
to
a
tender
offer,
emerson
purchased
152,282
shares
of
dodge
stock
at
$63
a
share
pursuant
to
a
tender
offer.
and
by
that
purchase
became
the
owner
of
approximately
13.2%
of
dodge’s
outstanding
stock
and
therefore
in
our
view
within
the
purview
of
the
act.
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
there
is
no
information
one
way
or
the
other
in
the
record
your
honor
as
to
whether
they
did
or
did
not.
it
is
our
view
as
i
will
touch
on,
more
fully
later
that
within
the
purview
of
the
statute
once
they
become
an
insider
by
reason
of
the
accusation
of
more
than
10%
they
are
presumed
and
irrebuttably
presumed
to
have
inside
information
and
to
have
the
opportunity
to
exploit
that
inside
information
in
whatever
way
they
see
fit.
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
yes
your
honor.
now
at
the
time
that
emerson
made
its
purchase
and
prior
there
to,
it
knew
two
things.
it
knew
first
of
all
that
dodge
and
reliance
had
entered
into
a
merger
agreement.
it
also
knew
that
its
own
management
had
authorized
the
submission
of
a
merger
proposal
to
dodge.
this
letter
in
fact
however
was
not
known
on
june
16
when
emerson
made
its
purchase
by
the
shareholders
of
dodge
nor
by
the
public
generally.
and
it
was
not
known
until
after
dodge
or
after
emerson
had
purchased
the
dodge
stock
and
indicated
that
it
was
going
to
solicit
proxies
to
oppose
the
merger
between
reliance
and
dodge
which
matter
was
to
come
before
a
shareholders
meeting
of
dodge
on
august
22,
1967.
within
a
few
days
after
dodge
or
emerson
had
acquired
its
13.2%
of
dodge,
it
received
a
letter
from
its
counsel,
dated
june
26,
1967
in
which
he
outlined
alternatives
to
a
proxy
fight
with
dodge.
and
principally
he
told
them
how
he
thought
they
could
go
about
avoiding
profit
on
the
disposition
of
their
holdings
in
dodge
principally
by
a
defensive
plan
which
would
involve
selling
just
enough
of
the
stock
to
be
below
10%
and
then
the
disposition
of
the
balance
so
as
to
avoid
the
impact
of
16
(b)
and
preserve
the
profit
on
the
second
sale.
now,
in
point
of
fact
in
the
proxy
fight
that
did
ensue
emerson
lost
and
dodge
was
merged
into
reliance.
immediately
upon
the
completion
of
the
meeting
at
which
the
shareholders
of
dodge
approved
the
merger,
august
22,
immediately
thereafter
emerson
undertook
the
deliberate
intentional
disposition
of
its
stock
as
rapidly
as
it
could
pursuant
to
the
plan
which
had
been
outlined
by
its
attorney
a
couple
of
months
before.
on
august
28,
1967
in
a
sale
to
goldman,
sachs
&
company,
it
disposed
of
37,000
shares
of
dodge
stock
which
had
the
effect
of
reducing
its
holdings
in
dodge
to
just
below
10%,
9.96
to
be
exact.
and
almost
simultaneously
with
that
disposition
it
entered
into
negotiations
whereby
it
sold
the
remaining
9.96
shares
to
dodge
which
sale
was
completed
in
early
september
of
1967.
both
of
these
transactions
involved
sales
at
an
amount
considerably
an
excess
of
what
emerson
had
paid
for
the
stock
so
that
the
net
result
of
what
emerson
had
done
pursuant
to
a
plan
which
had
been
in
its
mind
while
it
was
an
insider
was
the
disposition
of
its
entire
holdings
in
dodge
at
within,
as
i
said
three
months
had
a
gross
profit
including
dividends
that
were
declared
of
an
excess
of
$900,000.
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
you
are
absolutely
correct
mr.
justice,
and
what
i
meant
to
say
was
that
negotiations
did
--
you
are
forward
but
you
are
absolutely
correct.
they
were
initiated
indeed
by
reliance
on
behalf
of
dodge
and
those
negotiations
did
result
in
this
sale.
the
negotiations
however
which
took
place
were
precisely
of
a
nature
which
counsel
for
emerson
had
anticipated
because
in
his
letter
advising
emerson
as
to
this
defensive
plan,
he
had
contemplated
the
very
things
that
did
happen
and
suggested
that
it
might
be
one
of
the
ways
of
doing
it
and
he
issued
some
precautionary
instructions
with
respect
thereto.
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
well,
i
am
sure
it
was
a
natural
thing
for
them
to
want
to
get
rid
of
it
at
a
profit
as
soon
as
they
could
and
that
is
precisely
what
they
did.
and
it
is
our
position
that
having
undertaken
the
position
of
becoming
a
statutory
fiduciary
which
is
what
this
law
does.
that
they
were
not
free
to
dispose
of
that
stock
within
the
period
of
six
months
and
keep
the
profit
where
they
did
it
pursuant
to
a
plan
made
at
the
time
when
they
were
an
insider.
and
indeed
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
it
would
appear
to
us
your
honor
that
what
they
did
was
to
draw
up
a
plan
which
they
then
decided
as
soon
as
it
was
obvious
that
they
and
not
that
--
that
they
had
lost
and
had
not
won
the
merger
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
no
your
honor.
i
think
this
was
totally
within
their
own
mind.
this
was
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
it
is
drawing
up
in
the
sense
that
what
they
in
fact
did
was
precisely
what
the
lawyer
had
suggested
to
them
in
what
i
would
call
the
defensive
plan
as
an
alternative
to
a
proxy
contest.
and
so
that
when
they
sold
they
were
in
effect
carrying
out
what
had
been
planned
as
an
alternative
defensive
way
of
avoiding
the
impact
of
section
16(b)
and
thus
keeping
substantially
all
of
the
profit
on
the
sale
of
the
dodge
stock.
and
indeed
in
the
trial
in
the
district
court
based
upon
the
evidence
that
was
before
him,
he
made
certain
findings
of
fact
which
are
in
the
record
and
which
are
of
significance.
he
found
first
of
all
that
while
it
was
a
beneficial
owner,
emerson
determined
to
dispose
of
its
entire
holdings
so
as
to
avoid
section
16(b)
to
the
extent
possible
with
respect
to
the
profits
that
would
be
realized
in
such
disposition.
he
held
secondly
and
this
is
a
very
significant
one
that
the
first
sale
which
dodge
--
which
emerson
made
of
37,000
shares
to
goldman,
sachs
was
motivated
solely
by
emerson’s
desire
to
reduce
its
holdings
under
10%
immediately
prior
to
disposing
of
the
balance.
and
finally,
he
said
that
his
finding
was
that
these
two
sales
were
related
parts
of
a
single
plan
of
disposition,
the
substance
of
which
overlooking
the
form
was
to
dispose
of
emerson’s
entire
holdings
and
as
a
consequence
he
held
that
the
second
sale,
the
115,282
shares
also
fell
within
the
act
and
was
not
immune
from
the
act
by
reason
of
the
exemptive
provision
to
which
i
made
reference
a
moment
ago.
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
his
ultimate
legal
conclusion.
yes
your
honor,
the
conclusion
which
he
reached
based
on
these
findings
which
he
made
was
contrary
to
the
opinion
of
emerson
and
it
was
contrary
to
a
concurrence
by
reliance
with
this
exception
your
honor,
that
in
every
instance
so
far
as
i
am
aware
in
which
reliance
had
concurred
in
that
opinion,
it
reserved
the
right
to
take
whatever
view
was
necessary
if
shareholders
raised
any
question
and
if
any
further
developments
in
the
law
or
the
facts
should
dictate
otherwise.
and
in
point
of
fact,
we
do
have
a
very
significant
change
in
the
facts
which
was
not
known
to
reliance
at
the
time
it
expressed
the
views
to
which
you
make
reference.
in
that
it
had
no
knowledge
of
the
letter
of
emerson’s
counsel
and
therefore
no
knowledge
of
the
plan
as
i
call
it
of
disposition
arrived
that
while
emerson
was
an
insider.
the
eighth
circuit
on
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
yes
your
honor,
i
am
on
page
164
of
the
record.
judge
reagan
in
his
opinion
said
looking
through
form
to
discern
substance,
we
hold
that
in
truth
and
in
fact,
the
two
sale
transactions
were
related
parts
of
a
single
plan
devised
by
emerson
to
dispose
of
all
of
its
dodge
stock
and
so
on.
now,
when
the
case
got
to
the
eighth
circuit,
an
interlocutory
appeal
by
emerson,
the
fact
is
that
the
eighth
circuit
accepted
the
findings
of
the
fact
by
the
district
court
but
held
that
notwithstanding
that
acceptance
of
those
facts
it
was
compelled
a
whole
as
a
matter
of
law
that
section
16(b)
did
not
apply
to
the
second
sale
because
having
reduced
its
holdings
to
9.96
it
was
unfree
to
do
what
it
wished.
and
in
our
view
what
the
problem
that
the
appellate
court
had
was
in
feeling
that
it
was
obligated
to
restrict
its
view
of
the
case
to
ordinary
commercial
concepts
without
a
clear
and
full
recognition
of
the
prophylactic
effect
that
this
statute
was
intended
to
have
and
without
a
full
appreciation
of
the
liberality
of
interpretation
which
was
necessary
in
order
to
effectuate
the
purposes
of
this
statute.
it
was
for
that
reason
that
we
ask
this
court
by
a
way
of
a
petition
for
certiorari
to
review
the
eighth
circuit’s
approval,
of
a
technique
which
it
seems
to
us
permits
an
insider
at
a
time
when
he
is
an
insider
under
the
statute
to
shape
his
transactions
so
as
to
insulate
from
recovery
a
substantial
portion
of
the
profit
which
he
has
realized
on
profits,
on
purchases
and
sales
within
the
six
months
period.
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
a
little
over
three
months
your
honor.
they
did,
their
transactions
were
accomplished
in
less
than
three
months,
statutory
period
of
six
months.
now,
the
interesting
thing
in
analyzing
the
eighth
circuit’s
opinion
is
that
it
appears
that
the
eighth
circuit
had
no
difficulty
at
all
in
holding
that
emerson
was
liable
with
respect
to
its
first
sale
and
the
clear
thrust
of
the
eighth
circuit’s
opinion
is
that
if
emerson
had
sold
the
entire
13.2%
of
its
holdings
at
one
time,
there
could
have
--
there
would
have
been
16
(b)
liability
and
reliance
would
have
had
a
right
to
recover
all
of
the
profits.
difficulty
that
the
eighth
circuit
had
was
handling
the
problem
of
what
you
do
where
they
divided
up
to
accomplish
exactly
the
same
result
but
in
two
sales
followed
in
rapid
succession.
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
i
understand
--(voice
overlap)
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
yes
your
honor
and
in
situations
where
it
appears
to
the
court
that
the
sole
purpose
of
steps
taken
by
a
tax
payer
was
simply
tax
avoidance
having
no
real
business
purposes.
it
is
my
understanding
and
this
is
illustrated
specially
by
this
court’s
decision
in
gregory
versus
helvering
that
the
court
will
look
through
the
forum
and
get
to
the
substance
of
the
transaction
and
if
the
substance
does
not
have
any
real
meaning
other
than
tax
avoidance
then
the
court
will
not
permit
the
tax
payer
to
accomplish
what
he
set
out
to
do.
and
similarly
here
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
no
question
about
it
and
in
this
case
had
emerson
waited
six
months
the
same
purpose
for
waiting
would
have
given
them
immunity.
it
is
the
problem
as
we
see
it
here
is
that
what
emerson
did
was
to
make
a
decision
at
a
time
when
congress
by
law
said,
you
are
a
statutory
fiduciary.
you
are
presumed
to
have
inside
information.
you
are
not
permitted
to
show
that
you
are
innocent
and
did
not
have
it
and
therefore
when
you,
emerson,
made
a
decision
at
the
time
when
there
is
a
presumption
of
inside
knowledge,
it
is
fair
to
assume
that
that
decision
made
by
emerson
under
those
circumstances
was
one
dictated
by
the
accessibility
of
inside
information
to
it.
and
therefore
it,
emerson,
was
exploiting
an
opportunity
not
available
to
outsiders
but
available
only
to
it
by
reason
of
its
insider
status.
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
dodge
has
since
been
merged
into
reliance
and
it
is
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
oh!
yes,
it
was.
it
was,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
i
do
not
know
whether
it
was
or
not
your
honor.
i
know
that
there
was
no
such
discussion
between
the
parties.
now,
the
point
i
was
making,
your
honors
was
that
if
emerson
had
sold
the
entire
amount
in
one
sale
it
would
have
been
caught
for
the
profit.
and
this
is
because
when
you
review
the
legislative
history
of
this
act
it
is
obvious
that
what
congress
was
aiming
at
or
abuses
by
directors,
by
officers
and
by
shareholders
who
were
profiting
in
the
short
swing
speculative
trading
through
inside
information
or
through
manipulative
practices.
and
the
courts
in
construing
section
16(b)
have
recognized
this
congressional
purpose
and
the
language
of
the
courts
indicates
that
section
16(b)
is
to
be
construed
liberally
in
favor
of
the
corporation,
the
issue
where
that
is
and
strictly
against
the
shareholder,
emerson
in
this
case.
the
courts
have
used
such
language
as
thorough
going,
that
all
profits
shall
be
squeezed
out
of
the
transaction
that
the
purpose
of
the
law
is
to
set
up
standards
so
high
as
to
avoid
any
sort
of
conflict
between
the
selfish
interest
of
the
insider
and
the
faithful
performance
of
his
duties.
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
i
would
not
have
the
slightest
difficulty
in
mr.
chief
justice
in
holding
that
that
they
had
met
the
statutory
requirement
of
holding
it
for
six
months
and
they
would
be
immune.
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
well,
yes
it
could
be.
in
each
case
it
could
be
except
that
in
the
case
of
the
person
who
waits
six
months
and
one
day.
he
is
complying
with
what
the
statute
has
set
up.
he
is
permitted
to
do
that.
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
yes,
indeed.
no
matter
what
information
he
has,
if
he
waits
for
that
period
of
time
that
is
the
period
of
time
congress
has
set
just
as
he
can
buy
9%
of
the
stock
and
preclude
himself
from
being
an
insider.
but
in
the
case
of
the
person
who,
while
he
is
an
insider
decides
what
he
is
going
to
do
within
the
six
months
period
in
order
to
circumvent
that
requirement,
that
requirement
being
the
requirement
or
the
intention
of
congress
and
the
courts
to
avoid
permitting
insiders
to
speculate
within
the
six
months
period.
when
he
makes
a
decision
during
that
period,
it
is
fair
for
the
court
to
say,
he
has
made
that
decision
on
the
basis
of
inside
information.
he
is
therefore
taking
advantage
of
that
position
and
he
has
an
advantage
over
outsiders.
the
whole
purpose
of
the
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
only
because
congress
has
said
that
that
is
what
he
can
do.
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
yes
your
honor.
but
the
difficulty
i
have
as
i
say
is
that
he
can
buy
up
to
9.6
and
prevent
himself
from
becoming
--
coming
under
the
statute.
but
that
once
he
comes
under
the
statute
and
if
you
assume
as
we
must
that
he
then
has
inside
information
and
you
do
not
hold
him
to
the
second
sale
you
are
thereby
--
it
seems
to
us,
as
emerson
did
here.
you
are
creating
a
loop
hole
in
the
statute.
you
are
creating
or
approving,
it
is
the
better
word
not
creating.
you
are
approving
a
method
by
which
the
insider
within
the
period
which
congress
has
said
it
does
not
wants
short
swing
speculation.
you
are
approving
a
devise
by
which
he
can
so
structure
his
transaction
that
he
is
able
to
maximize
the
profit
and
keep
it.
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
he
is
not,
it
is
our
view
your
honor
that
anybody
as
an
insider
who
makes
this
determination,
well
he
is
an
insider
to
dispose
of
his
stock
in
two
sales
is
presumed
to
have
arrived
at
that
position
by
reason
of
information
which
is
available
to
him
and
not
to
others
and
when
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
oh!
this
turns
out
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
mr.
justice,
i
would
response
to
that
by
saying
that
i
think
this
court
just
as
the
district
court
did
is
perfectly
in
a
perfect
position
within
the
decisions
that
have
been
decided
under
the
securities
act
to
determine
that
the
word
sale
under
section
16(b)
includes
all
related
transactions
pursuant
to
a
plan
which
was
predetermined
at
a
time
when
the
man
was
an
insider.
and
that
you
do
not
have
to
put
on
blinders
and
look
at
each
segment
of
his
disposition
that
you
can
fairly
say
even
though
he
had
divided
these
in
two,
i
will
hold
as
a
matter
of
law
that
a
sale.
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
i
do
not
believe
so
your
honor.
and
in
any
event
there
are
the
additional
words
in
the
statute
which
say
at
the
time
of
sale,
he
must
be
10%
owner
at
the
time
of
sale.
i
mean
yes
the
problem
of
what
do
the
words
at
the
time
of
mean
and
i
think
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
judge
reagan
held
that
at
the
time
of
means,
the
time
involved
in
the
disposition
pursuant
to
a
plan
which
he
concede
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
no,
when
he
sold
it.
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
yes.
what
you
need
and
what
we
are
--
have
here
is
an
intention
to
do
something
made
while
an
insider
and
the
actual
carrying
out
or
execution
of
that
program
while
an
insider
and
having
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
no,
i
do
not,
i
would
not
call
it
putting
blinders
on
your
honor.
i
would
say
that
somebody
who
has
done
that
has
complied
with
the
spirit
of
the
actual
literal
wording
of
the
statute
and
the
spirit
of
the
statute.
when
a
man
does
what
has
been
done
here,
it
seems
to
us
that
he
may
well
arguably
have
complied
with
the
literal
wording
of
the
statute,
but
he
has
not
complied
with
the
spirit
of
the
statute
because
the
spirit
of
the
statute
required
that
if
he
thorough
going
and
squeezed
out
profits
and
yet
this
technique
permits
a
man
while
he
has
insider
information
to
determine
on
the
basis
of
that
information
that
it
is
wise
for
him
to
get
out.
but
instead
of
getting
out
in
one
sale
he
divides
it
so
that
he
insolates
from
recovery
a
substantial
and
this
can
be
done
in
every
case,
in
every
case
where
you
have
a
person
owning
over
10%
if
the
ruling
of
the
eighth
circuit
is
affirmed
it
would
mean
that
in
every
single
case
from
now
on,
insiders
can
in
our
view
circumvent
the
spirit
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
yes
your
honor
they
can.
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
there
can
be
questions
in
fact
with
respect
to
the
time
provision
too
that
is
there
may
well
be
a
question
in
a
particular
case
as
to
when
the
time
starts
to
run.
that
is
when
did
the
purchase
occur
or
when
did
the
sale
occur.
and
if
that
sort
of
a
question
came
up,
i
would
assume
that
the
court
would
liberally
construe
it
in
favor
of
trying
to
bring
the
transaction
within
the
ambit
of
the
law.
similarly
here
or
what
seem
to
me
that
where
the
word
sale
--
this
court
has
said
that
you
do
not
have
to
construe
words
in
the
securities
law,
in
the
ordinary
commercial
sense
but
you
may
construe
them
in
such
a
way
as
to
effectuate
the
purposes
of
the
act.
we
submit
your
honors
that
to
effectuate
the
broad
purposes
of
section
16(b),
it
certainly
requires
that
where
that
16
(b)
apply
here.
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
brings
before
the
court
a
question
involving
section
16(b)
of
the
securities
act
--
securities
exchange
act
of
1934
which
relates
to
short
swing
sales
transactions
involving
directors,
officers
and
10%
holders.
we
are
concerned
here
with
the
position
of
emerson
electric
company.
the
respondent
who
was
what,
has
been
described
as
a
beneficial
owner
under
the
statute
in
that,
it
was
at
the
times
that
are
relevant
in
our
consideration
of
this
question
more
than
a
10%
holder
of
the
common
stock
of
dodge
manufacturing
company
which
was
subsequently
merged
into
reliance
electric
company,
the
petitioner
here
in.
section
16(b)
of
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934,
is
set
out
in
page
2
of
our
brief
and
provides
that
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
the
unfair
use
of
information
which
may
have
been
obtained
by
a
beneficial
owner
or
director
or
officer
by
a
reason
of
his
relationship
with
the
issuer
that
any
profit
realized
by
him
from
the
purchasing
sale
or
sale
in
purchase
within
a
period
of
six
months,
shall
be
recoverable
by
the
issuer.
there
is
in
16
(b)
an
exemption
which
provides,
and
it
is
of
significance
in
this
case
that
the
subsection
shall
not
be
construed
to
cover
any
transaction
where
the
beneficial
owner
or
the
officer
or
director
was
not
such
because
at
the
time
of
the
purchase,
end
of
the
sale
or
the
sale
in
purchase
of
the
security
involved.
this
action
comes
before
the
court
by
a
reason
of
a
declaratory
judgment
which
was
initially
filed
by
emerson
against
reliance
asking
for
a
declaration
of
its
rights
and
obligations
under
section
16(b)
by
reason
of
its,
that
is
emerson’s
ownership
of
more
than
10%
of
the
stock
of
dodge.
briefly,
the
relevant
facts
disclosed
that
on
june
16,
1967
pursuant
to
a
tender
offer,
emerson
purchased
152,282
shares
of
dodge
stock
at
$63
a
share
pursuant
to
a
tender
offer.
and
by
that
purchase
became
the
owner
of
approximately
13.2%
of
dodge’s
outstanding
stock
and
therefore
in
our
view
within
the
purview
of
the
act.
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
there
is
no
information
one
way
or
the
other
in
the
record
your
honor
as
to
whether
they
did
or
did
not.
it
is
our
view
as
i
will
touch
on,
more
fully
later
that
within
the
purview
of
the
statute
once
they
become
an
insider
by
reason
of
the
accusation
of
more
than
10%
they
are
presumed
and
irrebuttably
presumed
to
have
inside
information
and
to
have
the
opportunity
to
exploit
that
inside
information
in
whatever
way
they
see
fit.
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
yes
your
honor.
now
at
the
time
that
emerson
made
its
purchase
and
prior
there
to,
it
knew
two
things.
it
knew
first
of
all
that
dodge
and
reliance
had
entered
into
a
merger
agreement.
it
also
knew
that
its
own
management
had
authorized
the
submission
of
a
merger
proposal
to
dodge.
this
letter
in
fact
however
was
not
known
on
june
16
when
emerson
made
its
purchase
by
the
shareholders
of
dodge
nor
by
the
public
generally.
and
it
was
not
known
until
after
dodge
or
after
emerson
had
purchased
the
dodge
stock
and
indicated
that
it
was
going
to
solicit
proxies
to
oppose
the
merger
between
reliance
and
dodge
which
matter
was
to
come
before
a
shareholders
meeting
of
dodge
on
august
22,
1967.
within
a
few
days
after
dodge
or
emerson
had
acquired
its
13.2%
of
dodge,
it
received
a
letter
from
its
counsel,
dated
june
26,
1967
in
which
he
outlined
alternatives
to
a
proxy
fight
with
dodge.
and
principally
he
told
them
how
he
thought
they
could
go
about
avoiding
profit
on
the
disposition
of
their
holdings
in
dodge
principally
by
a
defensive
plan
which
would
involve
selling
just
enough
of
the
stock
to
be
below
10%
and
then
the
disposition
of
the
balance
so
as
to
avoid
the
impact
of
16
(b)
and
preserve
the
profit
on
the
second
sale.
now,
in
point
of
fact
in
the
proxy
fight
that
did
ensue
emerson
lost
and
dodge
was
merged
into
reliance.
immediately
upon
the
completion
of
the
meeting
at
which
the
shareholders
of
dodge
approved
the
merger,
august
22,
immediately
thereafter
emerson
undertook
the
deliberate
intentional
disposition
of
its
stock
as
rapidly
as
it
could
pursuant
to
the
plan
which
had
been
outlined
by
its
attorney
a
couple
of
months
before.
on
august
28,
1967
in
a
sale
to
goldman,
sachs
&
company,
it
disposed
of
37,000
shares
of
dodge
stock
which
had
the
effect
of
reducing
its
holdings
in
dodge
to
just
below
10%,
9.96
to
be
exact.
and
almost
simultaneously
with
that
disposition
it
entered
into
negotiations
whereby
it
sold
the
remaining
9.96
shares
to
dodge
which
sale
was
completed
in
early
september
of
1967.
both
of
these
transactions
involved
sales
at
an
amount
considerably
an
excess
of
what
emerson
had
paid
for
the
stock
so
that
the
net
result
of
what
emerson
had
done
pursuant
to
a
plan
which
had
been
in
its
mind
while
it
was
an
insider
was
the
disposition
of
its
entire
holdings
in
dodge
at
within,
as
i
said
three
months
had
a
gross
profit
including
dividends
that
were
declared
of
an
excess
of
$900,000.
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
you
are
absolutely
correct
mr.
justice,
and
what
i
meant
to
say
was
that
negotiations
did
--
you
are
forward
but
you
are
absolutely
correct.
they
were
initiated
indeed
by
reliance
on
behalf
of
dodge
and
those
negotiations
did
result
in
this
sale.
the
negotiations
however
which
took
place
were
precisely
of
a
nature
which
counsel
for
emerson
had
anticipated
because
in
his
letter
advising
emerson
as
to
this
defensive
plan,
he
had
contemplated
the
very
things
that
did
happen
and
suggested
that
it
might
be
one
of
the
ways
of
doing
it
and
he
issued
some
precautionary
instructions
with
respect
thereto.
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
well,
i
am
sure
it
was
a
natural
thing
for
them
to
want
to
get
rid
of
it
at
a
profit
as
soon
as
they
could
and
that
is
precisely
what
they
did.
and
it
is
our
position
that
having
undertaken
the
position
of
becoming
a
statutory
fiduciary
which
is
what
this
law
does.
that
they
were
not
free
to
dispose
of
that
stock
within
the
period
of
six
months
and
keep
the
profit
where
they
did
it
pursuant
to
a
plan
made
at
the
time
when
they
were
an
insider.
and
indeed
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
it
would
appear
to
us
your
honor
that
what
they
did
was
to
draw
up
a
plan
which
they
then
decided
as
soon
as
it
was
obvious
that
they
and
not
that
--
that
they
had
lost
and
had
not
won
the
merger
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
no
your
honor.
i
think
this
was
totally
within
their
own
mind.
this
was
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
it
is
drawing
up
in
the
sense
that
what
they
in
fact
did
was
precisely
what
the
lawyer
had
suggested
to
them
in
what
i
would
call
the
defensive
plan
as
an
alternative
to
a
proxy
contest.
and
so
that
when
they
sold
they
were
in
effect
carrying
out
what
had
been
planned
as
an
alternative
defensive
way
of
avoiding
the
impact
of
section
16(b)
and
thus
keeping
substantially
all
of
the
profit
on
the
sale
of
the
dodge
stock.
and
indeed
in
the
trial
in
the
district
court
based
upon
the
evidence
that
was
before
him,
he
made
certain
findings
of
fact
which
are
in
the
record
and
which
are
of
significance.
he
found
first
of
all
that
while
it
was
a
beneficial
owner,
emerson
determined
to
dispose
of
its
entire
holdings
so
as
to
avoid
section
16(b)
to
the
extent
possible
with
respect
to
the
profits
that
would
be
realized
in
such
disposition.
he
held
secondly
and
this
is
a
very
significant
one
that
the
first
sale
which
dodge
--
which
emerson
made
of
37,000
shares
to
goldman,
sachs
was
motivated
solely
by
emerson’s
desire
to
reduce
its
holdings
under
10%
immediately
prior
to
disposing
of
the
balance.
and
finally,
he
said
that
his
finding
was
that
these
two
sales
were
related
parts
of
a
single
plan
of
disposition,
the
substance
of
which
overlooking
the
form
was
to
dispose
of
emerson’s
entire
holdings
and
as
a
consequence
he
held
that
the
second
sale,
the
115,282
shares
also
fell
within
the
act
and
was
not
immune
from
the
act
by
reason
of
the
exemptive
provision
to
which
i
made
reference
a
moment
ago.
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
his
ultimate
legal
conclusion.
yes
your
honor,
the
conclusion
which
he
reached
based
on
these
findings
which
he
made
was
contrary
to
the
opinion
of
emerson
and
it
was
contrary
to
a
concurrence
by
reliance
with
this
exception
your
honor,
that
in
every
instance
so
far
as
i
am
aware
in
which
reliance
had
concurred
in
that
opinion,
it
reserved
the
right
to
take
whatever
view
was
necessary
if
shareholders
raised
any
question
and
if
any
further
developments
in
the
law
or
the
facts
should
dictate
otherwise.
and
in
point
of
fact,
we
do
have
a
very
significant
change
in
the
facts
which
was
not
known
to
reliance
at
the
time
it
expressed
the
views
to
which
you
make
reference.
in
that
it
had
no
knowledge
of
the
letter
of
emerson’s
counsel
and
therefore
no
knowledge
of
the
plan
as
i
call
it
of
disposition
arrived
that
while
emerson
was
an
insider.
the
eighth
circuit
on
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
yes
your
honor,
i
am
on
page
164
of
the
record.
judge
reagan
in
his
opinion
said
looking
through
form
to
discern
substance,
we
hold
that
in
truth
and
in
fact,
the
two
sale
transactions
were
related
parts
of
a
single
plan
devised
by
emerson
to
dispose
of
all
of
its
dodge
stock
and
so
on.
now,
when
the
case
got
to
the
eighth
circuit,
an
interlocutory
appeal
by
emerson,
the
fact
is
that
the
eighth
circuit
accepted
the
findings
of
the
fact
by
the
district
court
but
held
that
notwithstanding
that
acceptance
of
those
facts
it
was
compelled
a
whole
as
a
matter
of
law
that
section
16(b)
did
not
apply
to
the
second
sale
because
having
reduced
its
holdings
to
9.96
it
was
unfree
to
do
what
it
wished.
and
in
our
view
what
the
problem
that
the
appellate
court
had
was
in
feeling
that
it
was
obligated
to
restrict
its
view
of
the
case
to
ordinary
commercial
concepts
without
a
clear
and
full
recognition
of
the
prophylactic
effect
that
this
statute
was
intended
to
have
and
without
a
full
appreciation
of
the
liberality
of
interpretation
which
was
necessary
in
order
to
effectuate
the
purposes
of
this
statute.
it
was
for
that
reason
that
we
ask
this
court
by
a
way
of
a
petition
for
certiorari
to
review
the
eighth
circuit’s
approval,
of
a
technique
which
it
seems
to
us
permits
an
insider
at
a
time
when
he
is
an
insider
under
the
statute
to
shape
his
transactions
so
as
to
insulate
from
recovery
a
substantial
portion
of
the
profit
which
he
has
realized
on
profits,
on
purchases
and
sales
within
the
six
months
period.
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
a
little
over
three
months
your
honor.
they
did,
their
transactions
were
accomplished
in
less
than
three
months,
statutory
period
of
six
months.
now,
the
interesting
thing
in
analyzing
the
eighth
circuit’s
opinion
is
that
it
appears
that
the
eighth
circuit
had
no
difficulty
at
all
in
holding
that
emerson
was
liable
with
respect
to
its
first
sale
and
the
clear
thrust
of
the
eighth
circuit’s
opinion
is
that
if
emerson
had
sold
the
entire
13.2%
of
its
holdings
at
one
time,
there
could
have
--
there
would
have
been
16
(b)
liability
and
reliance
would
have
had
a
right
to
recover
all
of
the
profits.
difficulty
that
the
eighth
circuit
had
was
handling
the
problem
of
what
you
do
where
they
divided
up
to
accomplish
exactly
the
same
result
but
in
two
sales
followed
in
rapid
succession.
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
i
understand
--(voice
overlap)
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
yes
your
honor
and
in
situations
where
it
appears
to
the
court
that
the
sole
purpose
of
steps
taken
by
a
tax
payer
was
simply
tax
avoidance
having
no
real
business
purposes.
it
is
my
understanding
and
this
is
illustrated
specially
by
this
court’s
decision
in
gregory
versus
helvering
that
the
court
will
look
through
the
forum
and
get
to
the
substance
of
the
transaction
and
if
the
substance
does
not
have
any
real
meaning
other
than
tax
avoidance
then
the
court
will
not
permit
the
tax
payer
to
accomplish
what
he
set
out
to
do.
and
similarly
here
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
no
question
about
it
and
in
this
case
had
emerson
waited
six
months
the
same
purpose
for
waiting
would
have
given
them
immunity.
it
is
the
problem
as
we
see
it
here
is
that
what
emerson
did
was
to
make
a
decision
at
a
time
when
congress
by
law
said,
you
are
a
statutory
fiduciary.
you
are
presumed
to
have
inside
information.
you
are
not
permitted
to
show
that
you
are
innocent
and
did
not
have
it
and
therefore
when
you,
emerson,
made
a
decision
at
the
time
when
there
is
a
presumption
of
inside
knowledge,
it
is
fair
to
assume
that
that
decision
made
by
emerson
under
those
circumstances
was
one
dictated
by
the
accessibility
of
inside
information
to
it.
and
therefore
it,
emerson,
was
exploiting
an
opportunity
not
available
to
outsiders
but
available
only
to
it
by
reason
of
its
insider
status.
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
dodge
has
since
been
merged
into
reliance
and
it
is
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
oh!
yes,
it
was.
it
was,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
i
do
not
know
whether
it
was
or
not
your
honor.
i
know
that
there
was
no
such
discussion
between
the
parties.
now,
the
point
i
was
making,
your
honors
was
that
if
emerson
had
sold
the
entire
amount
in
one
sale
it
would
have
been
caught
for
the
profit.
and
this
is
because
when
you
review
the
legislative
history
of
this
act
it
is
obvious
that
what
congress
was
aiming
at
or
abuses
by
directors,
by
officers
and
by
shareholders
who
were
profiting
in
the
short
swing
speculative
trading
through
inside
information
or
through
manipulative
practices.
and
the
courts
in
construing
section
16(b)
have
recognized
this
congressional
purpose
and
the
language
of
the
courts
indicates
that
section
16(b)
is
to
be
construed
liberally
in
favor
of
the
corporation,
the
issue
where
that
is
and
strictly
against
the
shareholder,
emerson
in
this
case.
the
courts
have
used
such
language
as
thorough
going,
that
all
profits
shall
be
squeezed
out
of
the
transaction
that
the
purpose
of
the
law
is
to
set
up
standards
so
high
as
to
avoid
any
sort
of
conflict
between
the
selfish
interest
of
the
insider
and
the
faithful
performance
of
his
duties.
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
i
would
not
have
the
slightest
difficulty
in
mr.
chief
justice
in
holding
that
that
they
had
met
the
statutory
requirement
of
holding
it
for
six
months
and
they
would
be
immune.
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
well,
yes
it
could
be.
in
each
case
it
could
be
except
that
in
the
case
of
the
person
who
waits
six
months
and
one
day.
he
is
complying
with
what
the
statute
has
set
up.
he
is
permitted
to
do
that.
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
yes,
indeed.
no
matter
what
information
he
has,
if
he
waits
for
that
period
of
time
that
is
the
period
of
time
congress
has
set
just
as
he
can
buy
9%
of
the
stock
and
preclude
himself
from
being
an
insider.
but
in
the
case
of
the
person
who,
while
he
is
an
insider
decides
what
he
is
going
to
do
within
the
six
months
period
in
order
to
circumvent
that
requirement,
that
requirement
being
the
requirement
or
the
intention
of
congress
and
the
courts
to
avoid
permitting
insiders
to
speculate
within
the
six
months
period.
when
he
makes
a
decision
during
that
period,
it
is
fair
for
the
court
to
say,
he
has
made
that
decision
on
the
basis
of
inside
information.
he
is
therefore
taking
advantage
of
that
position
and
he
has
an
advantage
over
outsiders.
the
whole
purpose
of
the
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
only
because
congress
has
said
that
that
is
what
he
can
do.
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
yes
your
honor.
but
the
difficulty
i
have
as
i
say
is
that
he
can
buy
up
to
9.6
and
prevent
himself
from
becoming
--
coming
under
the
statute.
but
that
once
he
comes
under
the
statute
and
if
you
assume
as
we
must
that
he
then
has
inside
information
and
you
do
not
hold
him
to
the
second
sale
you
are
thereby
--
it
seems
to
us,
as
emerson
did
here.
you
are
creating
a
loop
hole
in
the
statute.
you
are
creating
or
approving,
it
is
the
better
word
not
creating.
you
are
approving
a
method
by
which
the
insider
within
the
period
which
congress
has
said
it
does
not
wants
short
swing
speculation.
you
are
approving
a
devise
by
which
he
can
so
structure
his
transaction
that
he
is
able
to
maximize
the
profit
and
keep
it.
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
he
is
not,
it
is
our
view
your
honor
that
anybody
as
an
insider
who
makes
this
determination,
well
he
is
an
insider
to
dispose
of
his
stock
in
two
sales
is
presumed
to
have
arrived
at
that
position
by
reason
of
information
which
is
available
to
him
and
not
to
others
and
when
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
oh!
this
turns
out
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
mr.
justice,
i
would
response
to
that
by
saying
that
i
think
this
court
just
as
the
district
court
did
is
perfectly
in
a
perfect
position
within
the
decisions
that
have
been
decided
under
the
securities
act
to
determine
that
the
word
sale
under
section
16(b)
includes
all
related
transactions
pursuant
to
a
plan
which
was
predetermined
at
a
time
when
the
man
was
an
insider.
and
that
you
do
not
have
to
put
on
blinders
and
look
at
each
segment
of
his
disposition
that
you
can
fairly
say
even
though
he
had
divided
these
in
two,
i
will
hold
as
a
matter
of
law
that
a
sale.
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
i
do
not
believe
so
your
honor.
and
in
any
event
there
are
the
additional
words
in
the
statute
which
say
at
the
time
of
sale,
he
must
be
10%
owner
at
the
time
of
sale.
i
mean
yes
the
problem
of
what
do
the
words
at
the
time
of
mean
and
i
think
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
judge
reagan
held
that
at
the
time
of
means,
the
time
involved
in
the
disposition
pursuant
to
a
plan
which
he
concede
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
no,
when
he
sold
it.
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
yes.
what
you
need
and
what
we
are
--
have
here
is
an
intention
to
do
something
made
while
an
insider
and
the
actual
carrying
out
or
execution
of
that
program
while
an
insider
and
having
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
no,
i
do
not,
i
would
not
call
it
putting
blinders
on
your
honor.
i
would
say
that
somebody
who
has
done
that
has
complied
with
the
spirit
of
the
actual
literal
wording
of
the
statute
and
the
spirit
of
the
statute.
when
a
man
does
what
has
been
done
here,
it
seems
to
us
that
he
may
well
arguably
have
complied
with
the
literal
wording
of
the
statute,
but
he
has
not
complied
with
the
spirit
of
the
statute
because
the
spirit
of
the
statute
required
that
if
he
thorough
going
and
squeezed
out
profits
and
yet
this
technique
permits
a
man
while
he
has
insider
information
to
determine
on
the
basis
of
that
information
that
it
is
wise
for
him
to
get
out.
but
instead
of
getting
out
in
one
sale
he
divides
it
so
that
he
insolates
from
recovery
a
substantial
and
this
can
be
done
in
every
case,
in
every
case
where
you
have
a
person
owning
over
10%
if
the
ruling
of
the
eighth
circuit
is
affirmed
it
would
mean
that
in
every
single
case
from
now
on,
insiders
can
in
our
view
circumvent
the
spirit
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
yes
your
honor
they
can.
mr.
thomas
p.
mulligan
there
can
be
questions
in
fact
with
respect
to
the
time
provision
too
that
is
there
may
well
be
a
question
in
a
particular
case
as
to
when
the
time
starts
to
run.
that
is
when
did
the
purchase
occur
or
when
did
the
sale
occur.
and
if
that
sort
of
a
question
came
up,
i
would
assume
that
the
court
would
liberally
construe
it
in
favor
of
trying
to
bring
the
transaction
within
the
ambit
of
the
law.
similarly
here
or
what
seem
to
me
that
where
the
word
sale
--
this
court
has
said
that
you
do
not
have
to
construe
words
in
the
securities
law,
in
the
ordinary
commercial
sense
but
you
may
construe
them
in
such
a
way
as
to
effectuate
the
purposes
of
the
act.
we
submit
your
honors
that
to
effectuate
the
broad
purposes
of
section
16(b),
it
certainly
requires
that
where
that
16
(b)
apply
here.
