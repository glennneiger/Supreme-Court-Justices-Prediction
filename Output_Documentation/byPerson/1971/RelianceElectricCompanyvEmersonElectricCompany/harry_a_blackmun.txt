mr.
jenner,
let
me
ask
you
one
diversionary
question,
if
emerson
is
right
here
at
least
it
has
the
ability,
does
it
not
to
manipulate
and
i
do
not
mean
that
in
the
derogatory
sense
to
choose
which
shares
it
will
sell
in
order
to
get
under
the
10%
limit.
and
thereby
it
can
choose
those
with
respect
to
which
it
has
a
lesser
profit,
is
it
not?
