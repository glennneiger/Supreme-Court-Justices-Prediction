mr.
mulligan,
is
there
any
suggestion
anywhere
here
that
upon
or
after
this
acquisitions
through
tenders,
emerson
in
fact
possessed
any
insider
information?
unknown
speaker
mr.
mulligan,
you
said
that
it
entered
into
negotiations
with
dodge,
let
me
get
the
implications
of
that
statement.
am
i
mistaken
in
my
impression
that
it
was
dodge
that
approached
emerson?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
it
is
a
natural
thing
to
get
rid
of
that
stock
after
it
lost
the
title
for
the
dodge,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
suppose
in
a
capital
gain
or
loss
situation,
purpose
for
waiting
beyond
the
six
months
period
results
in
tax
savings
rather
than
somewhat
two
days
before
the
purposes
there.
unknown
speaker
incidentally
is
dodge
stock
listed
or
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
was
it
listed
at
the
time
(voice
overlap)
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
that
emerson
was
not
in
the
position
to
take
an
indemnity
from
dodge
in
case
it
got
stock
for
this
profit.
unknown
speaker
mr.
mulligan,
you
used
the
term
putting
on
blinders,
are
you
not
willing
to
put
the
blinders
on
though
once
the
six
month
has
expired?
unknown
speaker
once
they
get
--
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
10%
and
they
see
the
statute
it
has
two
provisions,
one
is
a
six
month
provision,
and
the
other
is
the
10%
provision.
and
as
i
get
your
argument,
you
are
feeling
yourself
bound
by
the
time
provision
but
not
by
the
10%
provision.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
will
see
if
i
get
this.
is
it
the
commission’s
view
that
once
he
has
acquired
enough
to
make
him
a
10%
holder
by
voluntary
purchase
then
any
of
that
which
he
sells
within
six
months
is
subject
to
16
(b)?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
why
do
we
have
to
go
beyond
that?
as
i
understand
your
position,
once
we
have
decided
that
this
was
acquired
by
voluntary
purchase
that
any
part
of
it
that
he
sells
within
six
months
brings
him
within
16
(b).
unknown
speaker
then
do
we
have
to
go
beyond
that
that
inquiry?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that
the
case
is
generally,
most
of
them
in
the
second
circuit
but
the
case
is
elsewhere,
had
stood
pretty
much
for
the
opposite
in
construing
this
statute
that
literal
language
of
the
statute
does
control.
that
the
statute
is
a
bland
instrument
if
you
will
that
if
the
period
of
holding
is
five
months
and
29
days,
it
is
applicable.
if
it
is
six
months
and
one
day,
it
is
inapplicable.
if
the
percent
held
is
9.9%
it
is
inapplicable.
if
it
is
10.1%,
it
is
applicable.
that
the
literal
provisions
of
the
statute
or
what
are
controlling
in
this
case,
that
is
what
i
understood
the
precedence
is
pretty
much
to
stand
for.
i
do
not
mean
in
this
case,
i
mean
in
construing
this
section,
16
(b).
unknown
speaker
i
was
thinking
about
that.
unknown
speaker
now
there
sometimes
been
litigation
over
this
--
for
something
was
a
purchase,
i.e.
an
exchange
and
so
on.
unknown
speaker
and
has
that
language,
has
been
used
perhaps
in
that
connection
or
whether
something
was
a
sale.
unknown
speaker
but
with
respect
to
its
basic
provisions,
have
not
the
case
has
pretty
well
told
us,
pretty
well
understood
the
propositions,
along
the
lines
i
have
said
that
this
is
not
a
refined
instrument
and
that
we
do
not
look
at
actual
motivation,
that
is
completely
irrelevant.
unknown
speaker
that
it
is
just
a
mechanical
bland
instrument
if
you
will.
unknown
speaker
i
gather,
are
you
saying
this,
that
the
exemption
provision
does
not
apply
at
all
where
the
acquisition
is
voluntary
purchase
and
for
that
reason
you
do
not
have
to
worry
about
the
language
both
at
the
time
of
the
purchase
and
sale
if
you
are
right
about
that.
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
but
as
your
second
argument
at
page
34
on
the
premise
that
maybe
you
are
wrong
about
that
and
that
to
the
exemption
does
also
apply
to
voluntary
purchases
to
which
present
answer
is
that
so
long
as
he
was
a
10%
beneficial
owner
anytime
during
the
period
in
which
the
sale
transactions
occur
then
he
is
subject
to
16
(b).
unknown
speaker
that
is
now
alternative
argument,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
if
it
reaches
voluntary
purchase.
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
the
first
one
is,
it
does
not
reach
voluntary
purchases,
that
is
your
first
argument.
unknown
speaker
no,
no.
wait
a
minute.
let
us
get
back
with,
the
argument
that
you
are
making
at
page
29
is
that
the
exemptive
provision
does
not
reach
voluntary
purchases,
is
it
not?
you
need
not
even
consider
the
exemption
provision
at
all
if
there
is
been
a
voluntary
purchase.
just
forget
about
it.
unknown
speaker
was
that
case
decided
before
or
after
blau
against
the
lehman
corporation?
unknown
speaker
and
only
it
would
have
been
decided
the
same
way
afterwards,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
in
point
of
time
mr.
jenner,
that
was
after
the
acquisition
was
--
unknown
speaker
wait,
why
would
you
say
--
let
me
get
back
with
the
general,
that
the
danger
was
that
when
reliance
and
dodge
consummated
the
merger
that
that
in
respect
of
emerson’s
purchase
for
purposes
of
16
(b),
would
constitute
a
sale?
unknown
speaker
that
was
involuntary
even
if
(voice

unknown
speaker
involuntary
sale.
any
over
--
beyond
10%
shareholder
involved
in
a
merger
is
going
to
get
some
profit
collected
from
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
jenner
you
talked
about
ways
out
of
this
--
after
all
we
are
talking
about
whether
you
are
to
make
the
profit
or
not.
i
mean
you
did
not
--
all
you
had
to
do
was
sell
and
you
could
get
your
money
back.
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
unknown
speaker
(voice

is
that
whether
you
should
profit
by
your
efforts
to
take
over
another
company.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
i
know
that
is
the
american
tradition
but
i
mean
that
is
the
issue,
is
it
not?
whether
you
should
make
the
profit
or
not.
unknown
speaker
not
whether
you
are
going
to
take
along.
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
understand.
i
understand
that.
but
you
are
not
locked
into
the
company.
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
question
of
your
being
locked
into
the
company
and
having
to
face
a
possible
loss,
when
you
could
--
when
you
could
have
gotten
out
anyhow.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
you
--
do
you
think,
if
you
put
your
stock
on
the
market
the
way
--
if
immediately
after
this
letter
of
counsel,
he
had
--
if
you
are
here
to
decide
and
then
load
your
stock,
could
you
have
done
it?
unknown
speaker
if
you
could
not
have
kept
the
profit.
unknown
speaker
that
is
right.
unknown
speaker
by
reason
of
16
(b)
that
there
may
by
reason
of
16
(b).
unknown
speaker
16
(b)
and
then
it
also
follows
i
guess
that
the
--
no
questions
before
us
with
respect
to
the
acquisition
of
the
reliance
shares
in
the
--
on
june
16th
any
1967,
being
of
a
kind
and
of
a
nature
that
falls
under
16
(b).
i
am
referring
to
the
point
might
raised
by
the
amicus
brief.
unknown
speaker
i
did,
i
did
(voice

unknown
speaker
because
there
is
one
school
of
thought
that
if
you
will
know
that
says
that
you
have
to
be
at
10%
owner
in
order
for
your
purchase
of
shares
to
come
under
section
16
(b).
unknown
speaker
in
the
amicus
(voice

unknown
speaker
(voice

to
be
sure
we
do
not
decide
that,
this
case.
unknown
speaker
but
in
this
case
we
can
proceed
on
the
hypothesis.
unknown
speaker
that
the
sale
comes
under
--
the
purchase,
there
were
some
purchase
comes
under
16
(b)
without
deciding
it.
that
might
be

appeal.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
and
the
same
price
was
--
per
shares?
unknown
speaker
(voice

on
the
facts
of
this
case
that
is
true
but
it
--
unknown
speaker
well,
with
that
kind
of
a
problem
would
run
into
in
the
tax
field
on

unknown

that
is

unknown

that
was

what
is
the

--
citation
of
that

that
you

is
that
it?
you

you
are

we

i
suppose
that

from

in
case
it
got
stock
for
this

unknown

mr.

you
used
the
term
putting

are
you
not
willing
to
put
the

on
though
once
the
six

unknown

once
they
get

10%
and
they
see
the

it
has
two
provisions,
one
is
a
six

provision,
and
the
other
is
the
10%

and
as
i
get
your
argument,
you
are
feeling
yourself
bound
by
the

provision
but
not
by
the
10%

unknown
speaker
well,
i
will
see
if
i
get
this.
is
it
the
commission’s
view
that
once
he
has
acquired
enough
to
make
him
a
10%
holder
by
voluntary
purchase
then
any
of
that
which
he
sells
within

is
subject
to
16

unknown

well,
then
why
do
we
have
to
go
beyond
that?
as
i
understand
your
position,
once
we
have
decided
that
this
was

that
