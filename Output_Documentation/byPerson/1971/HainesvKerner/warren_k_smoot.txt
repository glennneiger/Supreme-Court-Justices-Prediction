mr.
warren
k.
smoot
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
june
of
1968,
petitioner
filed
a
pro
se
civil
rights
complaint
in
the
district
court
of
the
northern
district
of
illinois
eastern
district.
in
addition
to
the
facts
that
mr.
bass
has
already
laid
out,
i
would
like
add
the
additional
facts
that
were
presented
by
the
complaint.
haines
was
65
and
he
was
working
in
the
yarding.
there
was
a
verbal
disagreement
between
himself
and
other
inmates
and
in
response
to
this
verbal
disagreement,
haines
struck
another
inmate
over
the
head
with
a
shovel,
a
dissent
that
was
observed
by
another
inmate
by
the
name
of
orlando,
a
prison
official
who
was
close
at
hand
came
to
the
incident.
he
administered
first
aid
to
the
inmate
that
was
struck
over
the
head
with
a
shovel
then
called
for
the
disciplinary
lieutenant
of
the
day.
there
is
a
procedure
at
menard
penitentiary
to
walk
serious
rule
infractors
to
the
disciplinary
captain.
when
mr.
haines
was
walked
to
the
disciplinary
captain,
he
admitted
the
violation
of
a
serious
rule
to
penitentiary.
he
admitted
to
the
lieutenant
that
he
struck
another
inmate
over
the
head.
in
response
to
this
admission,
mr.
haines
was
placed
in
what
menard
calls
a
holing
cell.
mr.
haines
calls
it
isolation;
we
will
accept
that
as
true.
on
the
same
day,
an
investigation
took
place.
on
the
same
day
march
10,
1968,
mr.
haines
was
given
a
hearing
in
front
of
two
captains,
one
was
lieutenant
one
was
the
captain
who
were
not
involved
in
original
incident.
the
investigation
report
of
the
guy
who
made
the
investigation
was
presented
to
mr.
haines.
he
was
confronted
with
the
investigation.
he
had
the
opportunity
to
rebut
the
investigation
or
in
the
alternative
to
explain
his
actions.
he
took
advantage
of
that
by
making
what
he
felt
were
minor
changes
in
the
investigation
report.
in
fact
he
said
“well,
i
did
not
bang
the
shovel
on
the
yard
room
floor
as
investigation
presents,
but
i
will
answer
no
further
questions.”
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
yes
sir,
your
honor.
it
is
a
policy
of
the
penitentiary
to
place
the
inmate
guidebook
in
each
cell
and
i
think
it
is
rule
19
which
prohibits
fighting
in
the
penitentiary
and
also
gives
the
inmates
notice
that
if
fighting
does
occur,
there
will
be
quick
and
summary
punishment,
including
potentially
isolation
and
revocation
of
good
time.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
it
is
in
the
respondent’s
brief,
your
honor.
i
do
not
have
the
page
at
hand.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
after
the
hearing,
giving
mr.
haines
the
chance
–
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
i
do
not
think
it
does,
your
honor,
but
it
is
the
policy
for
the
penitentiary
to
have
a
hearing
for
all
serious
rule
infractions.
minor
rule
infraction
such
as
not
standing
in
line
for
the
count,
taking
food
that
is
not
authorized,
often
times
the
guard
will
dispose
of
this
violation
on
the
spot.
but
any
violations
which
the
prison
considers
serious
fighting,
stealing,
contraband
they
will
have
a
hearing
in
front
of
an
impartial
disciplinary
captain
and
in
this
situation,
there
were
two.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
that
is
true,
your
honor.
they
are
penitentiary
staff
though
in
that
context.
only
after
haines
was
given
a
hearing
in
front
of
these
two
members
who
are
not
a
part
of
the
original
confrontation
was
there
a
disposition.
the
disposition
resulted
in
placing
mr.
haines
in
15
days
in
isolation.
he
did
have
a
toilet,
he
slept
on
the
floor
with
three
blankets.
he
admitted
having
one
meal
a
day
plus
bread
and
water
in
the
morning
and
in
the
evening.
he
alleged
the
absence
of
any
personal
hygiene
articles,
but
he
specifically
noted
no
towel,
no
soap.
he
also
alleged
his
false
teeth
became
rancid.
the
first
issue
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
is
whether
the
hearing
or
the
procedure
in
which
the
penitentiary
disciplined
mr.
haines
complied
with
due
process.
the
majority
of
federal
circuits
who
have
examined
this
problem
have
concluded
that
as
long
as
the
punishment
is
not
posed
arbitrarily
or
capriciously,
it
comports
with
due
process.
this
court
has
stated
in
several
cases
that
the
fundamental
requisite
of
due
process
is
a
meaningful
opportunity
to
be
heard.
the
meaningful
opportunity
to
be
heard
is
a
relative
concept
depending
on
the
capacities
of
those
to
be
heard
and
the
circumstances
of
the
situation.
this
court
has
also
noted
that
where
a
specific
proceeding
is
required,
the
nature
of
that
proceeding
would
depend
on
the
nature
of
the
alleged
right
involved,
the
nature
of
the
proceeding
and
the
possible
burdens
inflicted
on
the
proceeding.
i
think
when
we
look
at
the
facts
as
pleaded
by
haines
and
by
the
way
i
viewed
approximately
800
civil
rights
complaints
while
i
had
been
working
for
the
attorney
general
and
mr.
haines
was
not
only
articulate
pro
se
a
litigant,
but
he
had
pled
his
facts
well.
he
was
very
specific.
there
is
no
evidence
that
mr.
haines
is
inarticulate,
not
intelligent
or
incapable
of
presenting
his
own
complaint.
haines
admitted
the
rule
violation.
he
admitted
to
a
guard.
there
is
no
evidence
of
coercion
that
he
hit,
struck
another
inmate
over
the
head.
he
refused
to
answer
any
further.
after
an
investigation
by
the
guard,
being
presented
with
this
investigation,
mr.
haines
had
the
opportunity
to
rebut
the
findings
of
facts
in
the
investigation
or
explain
his
actions.
he
failed
to
correct
any
of
the
report
or
to
respond
other
than
to
make
minor
corrections
in
the
report.
the
disposition
occurred
only
after
investigation
and
a
hearing.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
there
is
no
question
that
the
record
supports
that
he
was
punished
for
the
rule
infraction.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
well,
i
think
it
is
a
reasonable
assumption
to
make
it
if
an
inmate
strikes
another
inmate
over
the
head
with
a
shovel.
he
admits
to
the
guard
and
there
is
investigation
and
after
they
give
him
the
opportunity
to
respond
to
that,
they
say,
alright
15
days
–-
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
not
in
this
situation.
no
sir
but
even
if
–-
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
alright,
it
could
be
possible
but
it
is
not
logical
in
this
situation
that
he
was
punished
for
not
--
he
already
admitted
the
rule
violation,
so
he
was
not
silent
in
this
situation.
he
admitted
the
rule
violation
even
if
he
was
silent,
i
think
it
should
be
permissible
to
punish
an
inmate
for
remaining
silent.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
yes
sir.
the
fifth
amendment
follows
the
individual
and
penitentiary.
no
question
about
that
but
the
fifth
amendment
should
not
permit
an
inmate
to
remain
silent
when
he
was
asked
solely
and
narrowly
questions
concerning
discipline
in
the
penitentiary
because
the
inmates
are
probably
one
of
the
sole
or
often
times
the
only
sole
information
concerning
what
is
going
on
in
the
penitentiary.
i
do
not
think
that
the
fifth
amendment
has
right
against
self-incrimination
should
prohibit
the
penitentiaries
for
disciplining
inmates
for
being
silent.
it
is
not
an
issue
here
and
we
are
not
quite
sure
what
the
punishment
would
be
for
remaining
silent,
but
obviously
it
is
not
logical
assumption
from
the
facts
in
this
case
that
mr.
haines
was
punished
for
remaining
silent.
there
is
no
issue
here
of
confrontation
and
cross-examination.
the
facts
were
not
in
dispute.
the
question
for
the
penitentiary
officials
was
what
would
be
the
result
of
the
situation.
there
are
no
complicated
fact
situations.
the
credibility
of
witnesses
are
not
in
issue
here.
there
is
no
biased
evidence
from
the
statement
of
the
pleadings.
so
since
the
facts
were
not
in
dispute
and
there
is
no
evidence
of
faulty
memory
or
bias,
obviously
cross-examination
now
requires
it.
mr.
haines
did
not
ask
for
any
witnesses.
he
states
in
his
complaint
that
orlando
was
in
the
witnesses
at
the
time
of
the
hearing.
he
did
not
ask
for
inmate
orlando
to
come
in.
it
is
a
policy
of
the
penitentiary
to
permit
inmates
to
call
other
witnesses,
if
they
have
this
or
in
the
alternative
if
the
disciplinary
captain
feels
it
is
the
better
practice,
he
will
go
out
and
have
an
investigation
or
write-up
a
report
on
the
other
witness,
comeback
and
present
it
to
the
inmate
who
was
subjected
to
the
hearing.
the
second
issue
concerns
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
i
think
equally
is
important
or
maybe
even
more
important
are
the
facts
that
haines
does
not
allege,
the
following
facts
are
not
at
issue
here.
haines
did
not
allege
that
there
was
any
absence
of
running
water.
in
fact,
he
had
running
water.
he
said
he
had
a
toilet
and
the
unit
in
the
isolation
cell
of
menard
only
comes
with
a
basin
and
toilet
and
not
separable.
so
he
had
a
wash
basin
with
running
water
and
a
toilet.
he
never
alleged
the
absence
of
running
water.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
same
unit
your
honor.
yes
sir.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
yes,
there
is
one
unit
there
installed.
they
were
installed
in
1968
prior
to
his
incarceration.
mr.
haines
does
not
allege
the
absence
of
any
shower
or
shave.
in
fact,
it
is
the
policy
of
menard
penitentiary
to
give
inmates
a
shower
once
a
week
and
a
shave
while
in
isolation.
he
never
alleged
he
did
not
have
a
shower.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
in
response
to
that
your
honor
may
i
say,
i
think
the
logical
implication
for
requiring
a
hearing
is
that
you
are
assuming
that
penitentiary
has
done
something
wrong
and
you
are
making
them
prove
off
that
they
did
not
do
anything
wrong.
i
think
the
proper
posture
–-
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
okay,
if
i
may
complete.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
i
think
the
proper
posture
here
is
when
you
have
a
complaint,
even
if
it
is
pro
se,
the
rule
says
that
a
liberal
construction
must
give
the
inmate
liberal
construction,
but
this
does
not
mean
that
you
plead
facts
for
the
individual
that
may
or
may
not
state
a
cause
of
action.
you
rule,
you
give
the
appropriate
remedy.
that
is
how
liberal
construction
says,
that
the
federal
courts
should
provide
the
inmate
a
remedy.
notwithstanding
if
he
says
habeas
corpus
and
if
it
is
really
civil
rights
or
vice
versa,
the
federal
court
should
apply
the
plurality
there,
but
not
plead
facts
for
the
individual
and
mr.
haines
was
very
specific
throughout
his
complaint
concerning
the
allegation.
he
mentioned
the
individual's
names
and
the
dates.
i
thought
i
think
it
is
logical
to
assume
that
if
he
did
not
have
running
water
or
did
not
have
showers
or
he
did
not
have
adequate
heat
or
ventilation,
he
would
have
brought
these
out
in
this
complaint
and
i
think
it
is
improper
for
the
federal
court
to
assume
the
absence
of
these,
hold
a
hearing
and
then
require
the
state
to
prove
that
he
had.
i
think
it
is
fair
to
both
parties
and
you
are
not
doing
an
injustice
to
a
liberal
construction
to
require,
the
federal
courts,
to
merely
rule
in
the
facts
as
pleaded
and
i
think
what
is
logical
here
is
to
show
the
facts
they
were
not
pleaded.
they
are
balanced
of
against
the
facts
that
were
in
concluding
whether
under
the
total
circumstances
the
incarceration
of
haines
was
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
there
was
no
inadequate
heat
or
ventilation
in
this
case.
there
was
no
inadequate
medical
attention.
he
alleges
no
permanent
physical
discomfort.
he
says
he
had
circulation
problems
at
that
time.
absence,
his
specific
allegation
that
he
had
no
towel
or
soap,
he
alleges
no
unsanitary
conditions.
so
you
have
a
situation
in
which
you
have
15
days,
that
is
the
maximum
time
an
individual
can
spend
in
isolation
at
menard
penitentiary,
in
every
penitentiary
in
illinois.
he
had
toilet,
he
had
a
running
water.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
that
is
right.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
yes,
i
suppose
technically,
but
it
is
not
the
procedure.
if
he
goes
out
and
would
strike
another
inmate
over
the
head
with
a
shovel
or
attack
him,
yes
i
think
technically
he
could
be
placed
back
in.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
technically
yes,
your
honor,
but
it
is
not
the
policy.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
that
is
right.
that
the
policy
has
not
to
do
that
for
technically
but
they
could.
yes,
i
guess
as
the
rules
are
interpreted
right
now.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
yes,
it
is
your
honor,
the
respondents.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
no,
it
was
not.
it
was
not
in
evidence
below,
but
i
think
it
is
a
legitimate
response
for
the
respondents
to
show
the
courts
what
other
jurisdictions
are
doing.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
yes
sir.
it
is
the
last
section.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
yes
sir.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
that
is
right.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
yes,
that
came
approximately
six
months
after
haines
was
in
there.
they
have
mattresses
now.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
if
you
remove
the
mattress
that
is
what
the
cell
was
like.
i
had
a
basis
of
the
facts
as
presented.
there
are
clearly
two
issues
under
the
eighth
amendment.
was
it
merely
disproportionate
and/or
was
the
implementation
unnecessary
and
painful?
this
court
has
looked
at
four
factors
in
determining
whether
punishment
is
cruel
and
unusual.
if
you
look
at
the
history
of
similar
or
the
same
punishment,
it
compared
what
other
jurisdictions
are
doing
in
the
similar
situations.
if
look
at
the
case
law
and
finally
they
have
contemporary
standards
of
decency
under
all
four
tests,
the
present
punishment
was
not
cruel
and
unusual.
there
is
no
question
that
in
the
1780s
when
the
eighth
amendment
–
when
the
eighth
amendment
was
enacted,
the
use
of
isolation,
silence
and
hard
labor
was
the
quakers
(ph)
humane
alternative
to
the
former
sanguinary
punishments.
the
law
in
that
state
prison
initially
started
using
isolation
one-twentieth
to
one-half
of
the
confinement
of
individuals
that
were
sentenced
to
death.
now
subsequently,
the
different
penitentiaries
through
out
the
country
in
the
early
1780s,
found
that
prolonged
use
of
isolation
was
detrimental
to
the
health
of
the
individual
so
they
discontinued
the
continued
use
of
isolation,
but
up
to
1840
and
both
the
auburn
penitentiary
systems
and
pennsylvania
penitentiary
systems
which
was
the
two
main
penitentiary
systems
in
the
1830s
and
40s,
isolation
was
continued
in
use
for
part
of
the
sentence
for
serious
violators
of
the
criminal
law
and
also
for
the
punishment.
in
fact,
john
howard
who
was
the
father
of
all
penological
reform
in
the
early
1770s
suggested
the
use
of
isolation
for
serious
rule
infractions.
there
is
not
question
that
historically
the
framers
of
the
eighth
amendment
did
not
intend
that
this
type
of
punishment
should
be
circumscribed
by
the
cruel
and
unusual
clause.
the
court
might
take
judicial
notice
of
many
of
the
federal
court's
opinions.
isolation
is
the
common
measure
for
discipline
in
penitentiaries
throughout
the
country.
now,
the
court
should
be
careful
because
not
all
jurisdictions
use
the
term
solitary
or
isolation.
they
may
have
a
different
term,
but
the
effect
is
the
same.
whether
you
call
it
administrative
segregation
or
you
call
it
corrective
measures
or
a
holding
cell,
the
removal
–-
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
or
the
hole,
yes,
but
i
think
the
use
of
the
term
the
hole
is
such
a
derogatory
that
it
kind
of
begs
the
question
in
this
type
of
situation.
for
every
jurisdiction
to
my
knowledge
uses
some
form
of
isolation
in
punishing
individuals.
the
case
laws,
there
is
a
multitude
of
cases
which
the
respondent
has
noted
these
in
the
notes
and
there
are
sufficiently
in
our
brief,
and
i
am
not
going
to
mention
them
here
but
there
are
common
denominators
of
the
federal
courts
that
could
have
come
up
with
in
determining
whether
confinement
is
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
the
common
analogy
involves
prolonged
use.
there
is
no
evidence
here
that
there
is
prolonged
use.
overcrowding,
haines
was
in
the
cell
by
himself.
unjustified
beatings,
no
allegation
that
he
was
physically
confronted
in
any
manner.
inadequate
food
or
water,
there
is
no
evidence
here.
i
will
address
myself
to
–
how
he
was
given
adequate
food
and
water
under
the
contemporary
standards.
there
is
no
allegation
of
adequate
heat
or
ventilation.
there
is
no
allegation
of
inadequate
medical
treatment.
he
makes
no
claim
here.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
inadequate,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
that
is
right
and
there
was
no
allegation
of
inadequate
medical
treatment.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
that
is
right
,your
honor.
i
apologize
if
i
said
the
opposite.
he
makes
no
allegation
that
it
was
unclean.
in
fact,
we
keep
these
cells
very
clean
and
the
fourth
and
the
eighth
common
denominator,
was
excessive
confinement
in
light
of
the
conditions
that
were
involved.
none
of
these
are
evident.
the
final
factor
and
i
think
this
is
particularly
relevant
here
if
we
apply
contemporary
standards
of
decency
or
rather
they
care,
but
i
think
we
can
place
it
into
more
specific
context.
if
we
look
at
the
american
association,
the
american
correctional
association,
recent
1966,
menard
penitentiaries
follow
this
as
a
penological
guide.
they
have
noted
the
custom
--
custody,
discipline
and
security
are
the
primary
functions
of
the
penitentiary
and
only
if
you
have
proper
control
of
the
inmates
can
you
have
an
effective
rehabilitative
system.
american
correctional
association
notes
that
isolation
is
acceptable
form
of
discipline
and
they
circumscribe
it
by
the
following
limitations.
no
more
than
15
days
at
a
time.
you
should
a
toilet
and
a
wash
basin,
but
they
observe
that
not
all
isolations
cells
need
a
toilet
and
wash
basin
because
it
is
been
their
experience
that
certain
inmates
for
causes
unknown
or
causes
known
would
go
in
and
break
things
up.
they
will
tear
up
toilets,
they
will
stuff
towels
down
the
toilet
seat,
there
will
be
an
overflow,
and
they
will
burn
the
mattresses.
there
may
be
on
restricted
diet
of
an
individual
here
who
has
access
to
limited
space.
as
to
the
claim
not
completely
dark,
they
observe
–-
well
they
acknowledge
it
shall
not
be
wholly
dark,
well-heated
and
ventilated.
if
we
take
a
look
at
a
situation
we
will
observe
that
the
prison
really
had
no
viable
alternative
than
to
use
isolation
and
i
think
the
court
should
keep
in
mind
that
when
you
are
comparing
whether
this
isolation
or
the
hole,
whatever
terminology
you
use
is
cruel
and
unusual.
it
is
not
logical
to
compare
the
confinement
to
your
bedroom
or
living
room
at
home.
it
should
be
a
relative
comparison.
these
individuals
are
in
the
penitentiary.
by
definition
punishment
must
be
somewhat
derogatory.
so,
if
you
place
an
individual
in
isolation
and
it
has
to
be
a
little
more
severe
than
the
normal
coming
and
going
that
he
has
in
the
prison
cells
or
it
is
not
effective.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
yes,
i
have
your
honor.
if
it
is
true,
we
have
to
accept
this
true
his
false
teeth
became
rancid,
but
it
is
due
to
his
own
shortcomings.
he
had
running
water
and
he
had
false
teeth.
he
can
remove
him
from
his
mouth
and
i
do
not
find
that
particularly
inhumane
to
require
a
man
to
remove
his
false
teeth
from
his
mouth
and
wash
it
underneath
the
running
water.
concerning
the
towel
and
soap,
he
had
showers.
at
least
it
is
not
an
issue
whether
he
did
have
a
shower
and
a
shower
once
a
week
and
a
shave
that
means
he
had
two
showers
and
two
shaves,
does
not
make
the
absence
of
a
towel
soap
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
in
my
estimation,
especially
i
think
the
test
here
is
reasonable.
the
penitentiary
has
1200
inmates
in
there
and
i
think
it
is
reasonable
for
the
penitentiary
to
set
up
a
situation
which
will
meet
the
average
individual.
haines
hit
another
inmate
over
the
head
of
shovel.
there
was
some
evidence
of
violence.
he
was
healthy.
he
was
working
on
the
yard
gang
with
pick
and
shovel.
at
the
hearing,
the
disciplinary
captain
had
the
opportunity
to
observe
his
physical
demeanor.
so
when
they
placed
the
inmate
in
there
without
towel
and
soap,
i
think
it
is
reasonable
to
conclude
that
they
could
be
used
as
a
garret.
they
could
place
the
soap
in
a
towel.
that
is
a
very
effective
blackjack.
so
when
you
compare
the
interest
of
the
penitentiary
to
prevent
their
guards
from
serious
attack
and
at
the
same
time
determining
whether
or
not
he
was
subjected
to
inhumane
punishment,
i
think
the
opportunity
that
he
has
a
shower
does
not
convert
the
mere
absence
of
towel
and
soap
a
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
especially
when
he
was
provided
with
adequate
food.
the
american
correctional
association
says
2500
calories
a
day.
he
had
a
regular
noon
meal
and
bread
and
water
in
the
morning.
that
composition
could
easily
total
2500
calories
a
day.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
we
do
not
know.
it
could
easily
have
done
so.
he
did
not
allege
that
it
was
inadequate.
he
had
a
regular
noon
meal.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
you
mean
the
people
that
are
released?
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
all
people
in
isolation
at
that
time
received
one
regular
noon
meal
then
bread
and
water.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
[laughter]no,
but
to
make
isolation
effective,
you
got
to
have
it
severe.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
pardon
me?
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
i
am
not
sure
it
is
a
minimum.
if
you
could
have
2500
calories
in
a
noon
meal
that
is
a
lot
of
starch
at
the
penitentiary
but
he
had
the
minimum
meal.
i
can
admit
that
and
still
with
clear
conscience
to
say
it
was
not
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
you
have
got
to
have
it
entirely
severe
to
have
it
punishment.
if
you
do
not
have
it
severe,
you
might
as
well
not
punish
the
individual
and
we
are
going
back
to
the
position
of
what
viable
alternatives
that
the
prisons
have.
they
have
1200
inmates
who
are
looking
at
this
situation.
punishment
has
got
to
be
swift
and
severe.
it
is
got
to
be
certain
and
it
is
got
to
be
a
consistency
there.
can
you
imagine
the
trouble
with
the
penitentiaries
individual
are
faced
at
saying,
alright,
you
hit
him
along
the
head
with
a
shovel
but
we
will
give
you
a
pass.
now,
the
next
guy
comes
along
he
got
just
a
little
different
situation.
now,
he
wants
a
pass
after
he
struck
another
inmate
over
the
head.
there
is
no
evidence
that
you
are
contrary
to
presume
that
mr.
haines
was
not
able,
he
will
hit
the
shovel
pretty
well.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
alright,
by
passing,
we
may
not
commit
him
to
isolation.
haines
(voice
overlap)
was
on
a
license.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
yes,
he
had
a
license.
he
could
not
have
good
time
revoked.
it
was
impossible.
he
could
not
earn
good
time.
you
cannot
take
good
time
away
from
a
death
and
life
sentence.
so
the
only
thing
they
could
have
done
is
three
things.
one,
do
not
punish
him
at
all,
give
him
a
pass.
two,
put
him
in
isolation.
three,
do
something
minor
like
take
away
his
earphones
or
not
to
let
him
attend
the
theater
for
that
saturday
or
for
three
weeks
coming.
i
think
in
the
context
of
penitentiary,
the
other
two
are
not
reasonable.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
that
is
right
but
he
already
had
been
up
to
that
your
honor.
so
he
could
not
–-
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
yes,
it
is.
but
i
think
that
goes
to
due
process
as
a
point
to
the
cruel
unusual
punishment
point.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
no,
i
am
saying
–-
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
well,
it
was
not
a
problem.
the
point
i
am
trying
to
make,
they
had
no
viable
alternative
even
though
it
may
affect
his
parole.
at
that
time,
they
had
only
three
alternatives.
no
punishment,
minor
withdrawal
rights,
or
isolation.
so
i
think
it
is
logical
to
say
isolation.
now,
the
question
for
this
court
to
answer,
was
the
implementation
of
isolation
reasonable?
i
think
when
you
compare
the
requirements
of
discipline,
the
requirements
of
the
penitentiary
for
custody
and
security,
when
you
bounce
at
against
fairness
to
the
individual,
i
believe
the
answer
is
that
this
was
not
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
even
though
you
personally
may
disagree
what
had
happened.
i
do
not
believe,
only
the
courts
have
not
so
founded
that
that
is
a
test.
most
recent
penological
advancements
are
not
the
test
in
this
situation.
the
fact
that
there
was
other
alternative
does
not
make
this
cruel
and
unusual
because
within
an
area
the
prison
should
have
discretion
to
apply
what
they
feel
is
appropriate
in
the
situation.
i
think
in
summary
and
conclusion,
i
submit
that
since
petitioner
was
disciplined
in
a
fair
manner,
no
question
about
that
and
he
received
punishment
that
was
only
a
workable
humane
alternative
available
to
the
prison
authorities
under
circumstances,
this
court
should
affirm
the
dismissal
of
petitioner’s
complaint.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
june
of
1968,
petitioner
filed
a
pro
se
civil
rights
complaint
in
the
district
court
of
the
northern
district
of
illinois
eastern
district.
in
addition
to
the
facts
that
mr.
bass
has
already
laid
out,
i
would
like
add
the
additional
facts
that
were
presented
by
the
complaint.
haines
was
65
and
he
was
working
in
the
yarding.
there
was
a
verbal
disagreement
between
himself
and
other
inmates
and
in
response
to
this
verbal
disagreement,
haines
struck
another
inmate
over
the
head
with
a
shovel,
a
dissent
that
was
observed
by
another
inmate
by
the
name
of
orlando,
a
prison
official
who
was
close
at
hand
came
to
the
incident.
he
administered
first
aid
to
the
inmate
that
was
struck
over
the
head
with
a
shovel
then
called
for
the
disciplinary
lieutenant
of
the
day.
there
is
a
procedure
at
menard
penitentiary
to
walk
serious
rule
infractors
to
the
disciplinary
captain.
when
mr.
haines
was
walked
to
the
disciplinary
captain,
he
admitted
the
violation
of
a
serious
rule
to
penitentiary.
he
admitted
to
the
lieutenant
that
he
struck
another
inmate
over
the
head.
in
response
to
this
admission,
mr.
haines
was
placed
in
what
menard
calls
a
holing
cell.
mr.
haines
calls
it
isolation;
we
will
accept
that
as
true.
on
the
same
day,
an
investigation
took
place.
on
the
same
day
march
10,
1968,
mr.
haines
was
given
a
hearing
in
front
of
two
captains,
one
was
lieutenant
one
was
the
captain
who
were
not
involved
in
original
incident.
the
investigation
report
of
the
guy
who
made
the
investigation
was
presented
to
mr.
haines.
he
was
confronted
with
the
investigation.
he
had
the
opportunity
to
rebut
the
investigation
or
in
the
alternative
to
explain
his
actions.
he
took
advantage
of
that
by
making
what
he
felt
were
minor
changes
in
the
investigation
report.
in
fact
he
said
“well,
i
did
not
bang
the
shovel
on
the
yard
room
floor
as
investigation
presents,
but
i
will
answer
no
further
questions.”
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
yes
sir,
your
honor.
it
is
a
policy
of
the
penitentiary
to
place
the
inmate
guidebook
in
each
cell
and
i
think
it
is
rule
19
which
prohibits
fighting
in
the
penitentiary
and
also
gives
the
inmates
notice
that
if
fighting
does
occur,
there
will
be
quick
and
summary
punishment,
including
potentially
isolation
and
revocation
of
good
time.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
it
is
in
the
respondent’s
brief,
your
honor.
i
do
not
have
the
page
at
hand.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
after
the
hearing,
giving
mr.
haines
the
chance
–
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
i
do
not
think
it
does,
your
honor,
but
it
is
the
policy
for
the
penitentiary
to
have
a
hearing
for
all
serious
rule
infractions.
minor
rule
infraction
such
as
not
standing
in
line
for
the
count,
taking
food
that
is
not
authorized,
often
times
the
guard
will
dispose
of
this
violation
on
the
spot.
but
any
violations
which
the
prison
considers
serious
fighting,
stealing,
contraband
they
will
have
a
hearing
in
front
of
an
impartial
disciplinary
captain
and
in
this
situation,
there
were
two.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
that
is
true,
your
honor.
they
are
penitentiary
staff
though
in
that
context.
only
after
haines
was
given
a
hearing
in
front
of
these
two
members
who
are
not
a
part
of
the
original
confrontation
was
there
a
disposition.
the
disposition
resulted
in
placing
mr.
haines
in
15
days
in
isolation.
he
did
have
a
toilet,
he
slept
on
the
floor
with
three
blankets.
he
admitted
having
one
meal
a
day
plus
bread
and
water
in
the
morning
and
in
the
evening.
he
alleged
the
absence
of
any
personal
hygiene
articles,
but
he
specifically
noted
no
towel,
no
soap.
he
also
alleged
his
false
teeth
became
rancid.
the
first
issue
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
is
whether
the
hearing
or
the
procedure
in
which
the
penitentiary
disciplined
mr.
haines
complied
with
due
process.
the
majority
of
federal
circuits
who
have
examined
this
problem
have
concluded
that
as
long
as
the
punishment
is
not
posed
arbitrarily
or
capriciously,
it
comports
with
due
process.
this
court
has
stated
in
several
cases
that
the
fundamental
requisite
of
due
process
is
a
meaningful
opportunity
to
be
heard.
the
meaningful
opportunity
to
be
heard
is
a
relative
concept
depending
on
the
capacities
of
those
to
be
heard
and
the
circumstances
of
the
situation.
this
court
has
also
noted
that
where
a
specific
proceeding
is
required,
the
nature
of
that
proceeding
would
depend
on
the
nature
of
the
alleged
right
involved,
the
nature
of
the
proceeding
and
the
possible
burdens
inflicted
on
the
proceeding.
i
think
when
we
look
at
the
facts
as
pleaded
by
haines
and
by
the
way
i
viewed
approximately
800
civil
rights
complaints
while
i
had
been
working
for
the
attorney
general
and
mr.
haines
was
not
only
articulate
pro
se
a
litigant,
but
he
had
pled
his
facts
well.
he
was
very
specific.
there
is
no
evidence
that
mr.
haines
is
inarticulate,
not
intelligent
or
incapable
of
presenting
his
own
complaint.
haines
admitted
the
rule
violation.
he
admitted
to
a
guard.
there
is
no
evidence
of
coercion
that
he
hit,
struck
another
inmate
over
the
head.
he
refused
to
answer
any
further.
after
an
investigation
by
the
guard,
being
presented
with
this
investigation,
mr.
haines
had
the
opportunity
to
rebut
the
findings
of
facts
in
the
investigation
or
explain
his
actions.
he
failed
to
correct
any
of
the
report
or
to
respond
other
than
to
make
minor
corrections
in
the
report.
the
disposition
occurred
only
after
investigation
and
a
hearing.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
there
is
no
question
that
the
record
supports
that
he
was
punished
for
the
rule
infraction.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
well,
i
think
it
is
a
reasonable
assumption
to
make
it
if
an
inmate
strikes
another
inmate
over
the
head
with
a
shovel.
he
admits
to
the
guard
and
there
is
investigation
and
after
they
give
him
the
opportunity
to
respond
to
that,
they
say,
alright
15
days
–-
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
not
in
this
situation.
no
sir
but
even
if
–-
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
alright,
it
could
be
possible
but
it
is
not
logical
in
this
situation
that
he
was
punished
for
not
--
he
already
admitted
the
rule
violation,
so
he
was
not
silent
in
this
situation.
he
admitted
the
rule
violation
even
if
he
was
silent,
i
think
it
should
be
permissible
to
punish
an
inmate
for
remaining
silent.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
yes
sir.
the
fifth
amendment
follows
the
individual
and
penitentiary.
no
question
about
that
but
the
fifth
amendment
should
not
permit
an
inmate
to
remain
silent
when
he
was
asked
solely
and
narrowly
questions
concerning
discipline
in
the
penitentiary
because
the
inmates
are
probably
one
of
the
sole
or
often
times
the
only
sole
information
concerning
what
is
going
on
in
the
penitentiary.
i
do
not
think
that
the
fifth
amendment
has
right
against
self-incrimination
should
prohibit
the
penitentiaries
for
disciplining
inmates
for
being
silent.
it
is
not
an
issue
here
and
we
are
not
quite
sure
what
the
punishment
would
be
for
remaining
silent,
but
obviously
it
is
not
logical
assumption
from
the
facts
in
this
case
that
mr.
haines
was
punished
for
remaining
silent.
there
is
no
issue
here
of
confrontation
and
cross-examination.
the
facts
were
not
in
dispute.
the
question
for
the
penitentiary
officials
was
what
would
be
the
result
of
the
situation.
there
are
no
complicated
fact
situations.
the
credibility
of
witnesses
are
not
in
issue
here.
there
is
no
biased
evidence
from
the
statement
of
the
pleadings.
so
since
the
facts
were
not
in
dispute
and
there
is
no
evidence
of
faulty
memory
or
bias,
obviously
cross-examination
now
requires
it.
mr.
haines
did
not
ask
for
any
witnesses.
he
states
in
his
complaint
that
orlando
was
in
the
witnesses
at
the
time
of
the
hearing.
he
did
not
ask
for
inmate
orlando
to
come
in.
it
is
a
policy
of
the
penitentiary
to
permit
inmates
to
call
other
witnesses,
if
they
have
this
or
in
the
alternative
if
the
disciplinary
captain
feels
it
is
the
better
practice,
he
will
go
out
and
have
an
investigation
or
write-up
a
report
on
the
other
witness,
comeback
and
present
it
to
the
inmate
who
was
subjected
to
the
hearing.
the
second
issue
concerns
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
i
think
equally
is
important
or
maybe
even
more
important
are
the
facts
that
haines
does
not
allege,
the
following
facts
are
not
at
issue
here.
haines
did
not
allege
that
there
was
any
absence
of
running
water.
in
fact,
he
had
running
water.
he
said
he
had
a
toilet
and
the
unit
in
the
isolation
cell
of
menard
only
comes
with
a
basin
and
toilet
and
not
separable.
so
he
had
a
wash
basin
with
running
water
and
a
toilet.
he
never
alleged
the
absence
of
running
water.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
same
unit
your
honor.
yes
sir.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
yes,
there
is
one
unit
there
installed.
they
were
installed
in
1968
prior
to
his
incarceration.
mr.
haines
does
not
allege
the
absence
of
any
shower
or
shave.
in
fact,
it
is
the
policy
of
menard
penitentiary
to
give
inmates
a
shower
once
a
week
and
a
shave
while
in
isolation.
he
never
alleged
he
did
not
have
a
shower.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
in
response
to
that
your
honor
may
i
say,
i
think
the
logical
implication
for
requiring
a
hearing
is
that
you
are
assuming
that
penitentiary
has
done
something
wrong
and
you
are
making
them
prove
off
that
they
did
not
do
anything
wrong.
i
think
the
proper
posture
–-
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
okay,
if
i
may
complete.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
i
think
the
proper
posture
here
is
when
you
have
a
complaint,
even
if
it
is
pro
se,
the
rule
says
that
a
liberal
construction
must
give
the
inmate
liberal
construction,
but
this
does
not
mean
that
you
plead
facts
for
the
individual
that
may
or
may
not
state
a
cause
of
action.
you
rule,
you
give
the
appropriate
remedy.
that
is
how
liberal
construction
says,
that
the
federal
courts
should
provide
the
inmate
a
remedy.
notwithstanding
if
he
says
habeas
corpus
and
if
it
is
really
civil
rights
or
vice
versa,
the
federal
court
should
apply
the
plurality
there,
but
not
plead
facts
for
the
individual
and
mr.
haines
was
very
specific
throughout
his
complaint
concerning
the
allegation.
he
mentioned
the
individual's
names
and
the
dates.
i
thought
i
think
it
is
logical
to
assume
that
if
he
did
not
have
running
water
or
did
not
have
showers
or
he
did
not
have
adequate
heat
or
ventilation,
he
would
have
brought
these
out
in
this
complaint
and
i
think
it
is
improper
for
the
federal
court
to
assume
the
absence
of
these,
hold
a
hearing
and
then
require
the
state
to
prove
that
he
had.
i
think
it
is
fair
to
both
parties
and
you
are
not
doing
an
injustice
to
a
liberal
construction
to
require,
the
federal
courts,
to
merely
rule
in
the
facts
as
pleaded
and
i
think
what
is
logical
here
is
to
show
the
facts
they
were
not
pleaded.
they
are
balanced
of
against
the
facts
that
were
in
concluding
whether
under
the
total
circumstances
the
incarceration
of
haines
was
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
there
was
no
inadequate
heat
or
ventilation
in
this
case.
there
was
no
inadequate
medical
attention.
he
alleges
no
permanent
physical
discomfort.
he
says
he
had
circulation
problems
at
that
time.
absence,
his
specific
allegation
that
he
had
no
towel
or
soap,
he
alleges
no
unsanitary
conditions.
so
you
have
a
situation
in
which
you
have
15
days,
that
is
the
maximum
time
an
individual
can
spend
in
isolation
at
menard
penitentiary,
in
every
penitentiary
in
illinois.
he
had
toilet,
he
had
a
running
water.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
that
is
right.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
yes,
i
suppose
technically,
but
it
is
not
the
procedure.
if
he
goes
out
and
would
strike
another
inmate
over
the
head
with
a
shovel
or
attack
him,
yes
i
think
technically
he
could
be
placed
back
in.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
technically
yes,
your
honor,
but
it
is
not
the
policy.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
that
is
right.
that
the
policy
has
not
to
do
that
for
technically
but
they
could.
yes,
i
guess
as
the
rules
are
interpreted
right
now.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
yes,
it
is
your
honor,
the
respondents.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
no,
it
was
not.
it
was
not
in
evidence
below,
but
i
think
it
is
a
legitimate
response
for
the
respondents
to
show
the
courts
what
other
jurisdictions
are
doing.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
yes
sir.
it
is
the
last
section.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
yes
sir.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
that
is
right.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
yes,
that
came
approximately
six
months
after
haines
was
in
there.
they
have
mattresses
now.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
if
you
remove
the
mattress
that
is
what
the
cell
was
like.
i
had
a
basis
of
the
facts
as
presented.
there
are
clearly
two
issues
under
the
eighth
amendment.
was
it
merely
disproportionate
and/or
was
the
implementation
unnecessary
and
painful?
this
court
has
looked
at
four
factors
in
determining
whether
punishment
is
cruel
and
unusual.
if
you
look
at
the
history
of
similar
or
the
same
punishment,
it
compared
what
other
jurisdictions
are
doing
in
the
similar
situations.
if
look
at
the
case
law
and
finally
they
have
contemporary
standards
of
decency
under
all
four
tests,
the
present
punishment
was
not
cruel
and
unusual.
there
is
no
question
that
in
the
1780s
when
the
eighth
amendment
–
when
the
eighth
amendment
was
enacted,
the
use
of
isolation,
silence
and
hard
labor
was
the
quakers
(ph)
humane
alternative
to
the
former
sanguinary
punishments.
the
law
in
that
state
prison
initially
started
using
isolation
one-twentieth
to
one-half
of
the
confinement
of
individuals
that
were
sentenced
to
death.
now
subsequently,
the
different
penitentiaries
through
out
the
country
in
the
early
1780s,
found
that
prolonged
use
of
isolation
was
detrimental
to
the
health
of
the
individual
so
they
discontinued
the
continued
use
of
isolation,
but
up
to
1840
and
both
the
auburn
penitentiary
systems
and
pennsylvania
penitentiary
systems
which
was
the
two
main
penitentiary
systems
in
the
1830s
and
40s,
isolation
was
continued
in
use
for
part
of
the
sentence
for
serious
violators
of
the
criminal
law
and
also
for
the
punishment.
in
fact,
john
howard
who
was
the
father
of
all
penological
reform
in
the
early
1770s
suggested
the
use
of
isolation
for
serious
rule
infractions.
there
is
not
question
that
historically
the
framers
of
the
eighth
amendment
did
not
intend
that
this
type
of
punishment
should
be
circumscribed
by
the
cruel
and
unusual
clause.
the
court
might
take
judicial
notice
of
many
of
the
federal
court's
opinions.
isolation
is
the
common
measure
for
discipline
in
penitentiaries
throughout
the
country.
now,
the
court
should
be
careful
because
not
all
jurisdictions
use
the
term
solitary
or
isolation.
they
may
have
a
different
term,
but
the
effect
is
the
same.
whether
you
call
it
administrative
segregation
or
you
call
it
corrective
measures
or
a
holding
cell,
the
removal
–-
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
or
the
hole,
yes,
but
i
think
the
use
of
the
term
the
hole
is
such
a
derogatory
that
it
kind
of
begs
the
question
in
this
type
of
situation.
for
every
jurisdiction
to
my
knowledge
uses
some
form
of
isolation
in
punishing
individuals.
the
case
laws,
there
is
a
multitude
of
cases
which
the
respondent
has
noted
these
in
the
notes
and
there
are
sufficiently
in
our
brief,
and
i
am
not
going
to
mention
them
here
but
there
are
common
denominators
of
the
federal
courts
that
could
have
come
up
with
in
determining
whether
confinement
is
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
the
common
analogy
involves
prolonged
use.
there
is
no
evidence
here
that
there
is
prolonged
use.
overcrowding,
haines
was
in
the
cell
by
himself.
unjustified
beatings,
no
allegation
that
he
was
physically
confronted
in
any
manner.
inadequate
food
or
water,
there
is
no
evidence
here.
i
will
address
myself
to
–
how
he
was
given
adequate
food
and
water
under
the
contemporary
standards.
there
is
no
allegation
of
adequate
heat
or
ventilation.
there
is
no
allegation
of
inadequate
medical
treatment.
he
makes
no
claim
here.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
inadequate,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
that
is
right
and
there
was
no
allegation
of
inadequate
medical
treatment.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
that
is
right
,your
honor.
i
apologize
if
i
said
the
opposite.
he
makes
no
allegation
that
it
was
unclean.
in
fact,
we
keep
these
cells
very
clean
and
the
fourth
and
the
eighth
common
denominator,
was
excessive
confinement
in
light
of
the
conditions
that
were
involved.
none
of
these
are
evident.
the
final
factor
and
i
think
this
is
particularly
relevant
here
if
we
apply
contemporary
standards
of
decency
or
rather
they
care,
but
i
think
we
can
place
it
into
more
specific
context.
if
we
look
at
the
american
association,
the
american
correctional
association,
recent
1966,
menard
penitentiaries
follow
this
as
a
penological
guide.
they
have
noted
the
custom
--
custody,
discipline
and
security
are
the
primary
functions
of
the
penitentiary
and
only
if
you
have
proper
control
of
the
inmates
can
you
have
an
effective
rehabilitative
system.
american
correctional
association
notes
that
isolation
is
acceptable
form
of
discipline
and
they
circumscribe
it
by
the
following
limitations.
no
more
than
15
days
at
a
time.
you
should
a
toilet
and
a
wash
basin,
but
they
observe
that
not
all
isolations
cells
need
a
toilet
and
wash
basin
because
it
is
been
their
experience
that
certain
inmates
for
causes
unknown
or
causes
known
would
go
in
and
break
things
up.
they
will
tear
up
toilets,
they
will
stuff
towels
down
the
toilet
seat,
there
will
be
an
overflow,
and
they
will
burn
the
mattresses.
there
may
be
on
restricted
diet
of
an
individual
here
who
has
access
to
limited
space.
as
to
the
claim
not
completely
dark,
they
observe
–-
well
they
acknowledge
it
shall
not
be
wholly
dark,
well-heated
and
ventilated.
if
we
take
a
look
at
a
situation
we
will
observe
that
the
prison
really
had
no
viable
alternative
than
to
use
isolation
and
i
think
the
court
should
keep
in
mind
that
when
you
are
comparing
whether
this
isolation
or
the
hole,
whatever
terminology
you
use
is
cruel
and
unusual.
it
is
not
logical
to
compare
the
confinement
to
your
bedroom
or
living
room
at
home.
it
should
be
a
relative
comparison.
these
individuals
are
in
the
penitentiary.
by
definition
punishment
must
be
somewhat
derogatory.
so,
if
you
place
an
individual
in
isolation
and
it
has
to
be
a
little
more
severe
than
the
normal
coming
and
going
that
he
has
in
the
prison
cells
or
it
is
not
effective.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
yes,
i
have
your
honor.
if
it
is
true,
we
have
to
accept
this
true
his
false
teeth
became
rancid,
but
it
is
due
to
his
own
shortcomings.
he
had
running
water
and
he
had
false
teeth.
he
can
remove
him
from
his
mouth
and
i
do
not
find
that
particularly
inhumane
to
require
a
man
to
remove
his
false
teeth
from
his
mouth
and
wash
it
underneath
the
running
water.
concerning
the
towel
and
soap,
he
had
showers.
at
least
it
is
not
an
issue
whether
he
did
have
a
shower
and
a
shower
once
a
week
and
a
shave
that
means
he
had
two
showers
and
two
shaves,
does
not
make
the
absence
of
a
towel
soap
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
in
my
estimation,
especially
i
think
the
test
here
is
reasonable.
the
penitentiary
has
1200
inmates
in
there
and
i
think
it
is
reasonable
for
the
penitentiary
to
set
up
a
situation
which
will
meet
the
average
individual.
haines
hit
another
inmate
over
the
head
of
shovel.
there
was
some
evidence
of
violence.
he
was
healthy.
he
was
working
on
the
yard
gang
with
pick
and
shovel.
at
the
hearing,
the
disciplinary
captain
had
the
opportunity
to
observe
his
physical
demeanor.
so
when
they
placed
the
inmate
in
there
without
towel
and
soap,
i
think
it
is
reasonable
to
conclude
that
they
could
be
used
as
a
garret.
they
could
place
the
soap
in
a
towel.
that
is
a
very
effective
blackjack.
so
when
you
compare
the
interest
of
the
penitentiary
to
prevent
their
guards
from
serious
attack
and
at
the
same
time
determining
whether
or
not
he
was
subjected
to
inhumane
punishment,
i
think
the
opportunity
that
he
has
a
shower
does
not
convert
the
mere
absence
of
towel
and
soap
a
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
especially
when
he
was
provided
with
adequate
food.
the
american
correctional
association
says
2500
calories
a
day.
he
had
a
regular
noon
meal
and
bread
and
water
in
the
morning.
that
composition
could
easily
total
2500
calories
a
day.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
we
do
not
know.
it
could
easily
have
done
so.
he
did
not
allege
that
it
was
inadequate.
he
had
a
regular
noon
meal.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
you
mean
the
people
that
are
released?
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
all
people
in
isolation
at
that
time
received
one
regular
noon
meal
then
bread
and
water.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
[laughter]no,
but
to
make
isolation
effective,
you
got
to
have
it
severe.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
pardon
me?
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
i
am
not
sure
it
is
a
minimum.
if
you
could
have
2500
calories
in
a
noon
meal
that
is
a
lot
of
starch
at
the
penitentiary
but
he
had
the
minimum
meal.
i
can
admit
that
and
still
with
clear
conscience
to
say
it
was
not
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
you
have
got
to
have
it
entirely
severe
to
have
it
punishment.
if
you
do
not
have
it
severe,
you
might
as
well
not
punish
the
individual
and
we
are
going
back
to
the
position
of
what
viable
alternatives
that
the
prisons
have.
they
have
1200
inmates
who
are
looking
at
this
situation.
punishment
has
got
to
be
swift
and
severe.
it
is
got
to
be
certain
and
it
is
got
to
be
a
consistency
there.
can
you
imagine
the
trouble
with
the
penitentiaries
individual
are
faced
at
saying,
alright,
you
hit
him
along
the
head
with
a
shovel
but
we
will
give
you
a
pass.
now,
the
next
guy
comes
along
he
got
just
a
little
different
situation.
now,
he
wants
a
pass
after
he
struck
another
inmate
over
the
head.
there
is
no
evidence
that
you
are
contrary
to
presume
that
mr.
haines
was
not
able,
he
will
hit
the
shovel
pretty
well.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
alright,
by
passing,
we
may
not
commit
him
to
isolation.
haines
(voice
overlap)
was
on
a
license.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
yes,
he
had
a
license.
he
could
not
have
good
time
revoked.
it
was
impossible.
he
could
not
earn
good
time.
you
cannot
take
good
time
away
from
a
death
and
life
sentence.
so
the
only
thing
they
could
have
done
is
three
things.
one,
do
not
punish
him
at
all,
give
him
a
pass.
two,
put
him
in
isolation.
three,
do
something
minor
like
take
away
his
earphones
or
not
to
let
him
attend
the
theater
for
that
saturday
or
for
three
weeks
coming.
i
think
in
the
context
of
penitentiary,
the
other
two
are
not
reasonable.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
that
is
right
but
he
already
had
been
up
to
that
your
honor.
so
he
could
not
–-
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
yes,
it
is.
but
i
think
that
goes
to
due
process
as
a
point
to
the
cruel
unusual
punishment
point.
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
no,
i
am
saying
–-
mr.
warren
k.
smoot
well,
it
was
not
a
problem.
the
point
i
am
trying
to
make,
they
had
no
viable
alternative
even
though
it
may
affect
his
parole.
at
that
time,
they
had
only
three
alternatives.
no
punishment,
minor
withdrawal
rights,
or
isolation.
so
i
think
it
is
logical
to
say
isolation.
now,
the
question
for
this
court
to
answer,
was
the
implementation
of
isolation
reasonable?
i
think
when
you
compare
the
requirements
of
discipline,
the
requirements
of
the
penitentiary
for
custody
and
security,
when
you
bounce
at
against
fairness
to
the
individual,
i
believe
the
answer
is
that
this
was
not
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
even
though
you
personally
may
disagree
what
had
happened.
i
do
not
believe,
only
the
courts
have
not
so
founded
that
that
is
a
test.
most
recent
penological
advancements
are
not
the
test
in
this
situation.
the
fact
that
there
was
other
alternative
does
not
make
this
cruel
and
unusual
because
within
an
area
the
prison
should
have
discretion
to
apply
what
they
feel
is
appropriate
in
the
situation.
i
think
in
summary
and
conclusion,
i
submit
that
since
petitioner
was
disciplined
in
a
fair
manner,
no
question
about
that
and
he
received
punishment
that
was
only
a
workable
humane
alternative
available
to
the
prison
authorities
under
circumstances,
this
court
should
affirm
the
dismissal
of
petitioner’s
complaint.
