mr.
stanley
a.
bass
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
which
affirmed
the
dismissal
of
a
pro
se
action
brought
by
an
illinois
prisoner
against
prison
officials
and
others
under
42
u.s.c.
section
1983
seeking
damages
and
other
relief
for
injuries
resulting
from
allegedly
unconstitutional
disciplinary
treatment.
the
district
court
granted
the
respondent
officials'
motion
to
dismiss
without
allowing
relief
to
amend
or
to
amplify,
without
directing
an
answer
from
the
defendants,
without
allowing
discovery,
without
a
point
to
counsel
as
some
other
person
to
assist
the
petitioner
and
without
conducting
any
hearing.
the
facts
are
basically
as
follows.
in
1968,
haines
was
then
66
years
old,
was
an
inmate
of
the
illinois
state
penitentiary
serving
a
life
sentence
imposed
for
burglary
as
habitual
offender
which
was
imposed
in
1939.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
he
was
in
menard.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
at
the
time
he
had
a
foot
disability
for
which
he
had
been
awarded
compensation
by
the
illinois
industrial
commission.
on
march
10
of
1968,
haines
while
on
work
detail
was
threatened
by
two
younger
inmates
about
30
years
old.
statements
were
made
by
the
other
inmates
to
the
effect
that
the
young
blood
was
taking
over
and
that
the
old
blood
like
haines
was
dying.
haines
did
not
immediately
react
to
these
torrents,
but
obtained
an
inmate
pass
to
go
outside
and
inspect
the
pile
of
cinders.
when
haines
reentered
the
shack,
the
two
younger
inmates
resumed
their
arguments
and
their
threats
stating
that
haines
had
better
watch
out
or
he
would
be
hurt.
again,
haines
did
not
react.
after
haines
entered
the
bathroom,
these
other
inmates
approached
him
in
a
threatening
manner
and
resumed
the
argument.
one
of
the
two
men
asked
him
if
he
wanted
to
start
something,
he
thinks
of
dorothy
and
haines
then
hit
dorothy
with
a
shovel.
subsequently,
there
was
a
scuffle
with
mr.
moore
and
after
that
mr.
haines
was
taken
by
one
of
the
officials
of
the
prison
to
the
solitary
confinement.
sometime
after
that
which
is
not
clear
from
the
complaint,
mr.
haines
was
taken
by
the
defendant
rogers
to
the
disciplinary
officer.
mr.
haines
refused
to
explain
his
actions
other
then
to
acknowledge
he
had
hit
dorothy
with
the
shovel.
he
was
locked
again
in
an
isolation
cell
until
the
report
that
he
had
from
the
defendant
duncan.
sometime
after
that,
it
is
also
not
clear
how
long
the
period
was,
the
report
was
submitted
to
the
disciplinary
committee.
at
that
time
haines
was
brought
before
them
and
objected
to
certain
statements
regarding
his
hitting
the
shovel
on
the
floor.
haines
had
indicated
that
he
had
dislodged
some
dirt
from
the
shovel
and
the
defendant
lance
wanted
to
know
why
plaintiff
would
hit
dorothy
and
stated
that
it
been
28
years
since
mr.
haines
had
been
in
the
hole.
when
plaintiff
refused
to
talk
to
these
officers
he
was
given
15
days
punishment
in
solitary
from
march
10
to
march
25,
1968.
mr.
haines
described
somewhat
the
conditions
of
the
solitary.
he
said
that
it
was
a
dark
cell,
that
he
had
no
bed
or
mattress,
that
he
had
to
sleep
on
the
floor
on
blankets,
that
he
had
received
one
regular
meal
during
the
afternoon
and
some
bread
in
the
morning
and
in
the
evening,
that
there
were
no
personal
articles
of
hygiene,
specifically
no
soap
or
towel
and
that
his
false
teeth
became
so
rancid
he
had
to
take
them
out.
following
his
day
in
solitary
confinement,
mr.
haines
was
demoted
to
c
grade
which
meant
that
he
lost
certain
commissary
privileges
and
other
privileges
which
haines
said
are
not
known
to
him.
although
in
discovery
haines
filed
numerous
requests
for
admissions
and
interrogatories
where
he
sought
to
ascertain
more
information
along
that
line.
the
issues
in
the
case
are
first
whether
or
not
the
district
court
prematurely
dismissed
the
complaint.
secondly,
whether
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
of
this
particular
solitary
confinement
as
applied
for
this
particular
inmate
unjustified
on
this
record
violated
haines'
right
to
be
free
from
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
third,
whether
haines
was
effectively
precluded
from
making
a
defense
or
self-defense
at
the
disciplinary
proceeding
and
finally
there
is
a
question
of
whether
or
not
haines
was
penalized
for
exercising
his
right
to
remain
silent
until
the
existence
of
any
immunity
was
fairly
demonstrated
to
him.
the
issues
that
are
not
involved
in
this
case
are
a
general
attack
upon
solitary
confinement
per
se
under
humane
conditions
and
secondly
whether
or
not
the
application
of
goldberg
versus
kelly
type
of
procedures
apply
to
all
disciplinary
proceedings.
we
deal
in
this
situation
with
the
specific
problem
where
a
man
is
charged
with
a
prosecutable
offense
where
a
self-incrimination
question
must
be
dealt
with.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
the
record
does
not
show
what
happened
to
dorothy
and
moore
in
terms
of
whether
or
not
they
were
punished
or
prosecuted
nor
does
the
record
show
if
haines
was
ever
prosecuted.
i
believe
he
was
not.
the
principles
applicable
to
this
–
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
i
do
not
know.
well,
i
do
know
that
he
was
not
prosecuted
from
talking
to
mr.
haines,
but
i
do
not
know
that
the
other
two
individuals.
but
the
principles
applicable
to
the
eighth
amendment
claim
are
well
stated
in
jackson
versus
fischer
in
the
opinion
by
mr.
justice
blackmun
then
a
circuit
judge.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
we
said
that
there
was
a
disciplinary
hearing.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
the
district
court
summarily
dismiss
under
the
motion
of
the
defendants
to
dismiss.
so
there
is
no
evidence
on
which
we
can
(inaudible)
–-
the
only
thing
we
have
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
which
are
taken
us
true
for
present
purposes
which
must
be
liberally
construed
in
accordance
with
pro
se
of
willing
rule.
quoting
from
the
supreme
court
pronouncements
in
jackson
versus
bishop,
mr.
justice
blackmun
pointed
out
that
the
meaning
of
the
eighth
amendment
is
nothing
less
than
the
dignity
of
man
that
it
is
a
flexible
guarantee
drawing
meaning
from
evolving
standards
of
decency
that
mark
the
progress
of
a
maturing
society,
wanton
infliction
of
pain
and
unnecessary
cruelty
are
barred.
significantly
a
statement
is
made
there
that
brought
an
idealistic
concept
of
dignity,
civilized
standards,
humanity
and
decency
are
useful
and
usable
and
as
we
point
out,
the
practices
of
other
jurisdictions,
standards
of
the
american
correctional
association,
the
united
nations
minimum
standards
and
the
views
of
experts
show
that
these
concepts
are
also
practical
and
workable.
this
court
has
not
hesitated
to
strike
down
state
penal
practices
which
contravene
federal
constitutional
guarantees.
younger
versus
gilmore,
cruz
versus
hope,
johnson
versus
avery,
cooper
versus
pate
and
lee
versus
washington,
all
involved
the
cases
where
state
penal
practices
were
held
to
be
inconsistent
with
the
federal
constitution.
it
appears
that
the
respondents
do
fall
back
to
the
position
that
the
action
taken
here
was
actually
necessary
to
the
maintenance
of
prison
discipline
and
security.
but
interestingly
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
to
support
that
conclusion
and
that
is
another
reason
why
the
case
needs
to
be
remanded.
they
suggest
possible
abuse
of
facilities
by
a
person
in
solitary
confinement
as
an
abstract
possibility,
but
nowhere
as
it
is
suggested,
as
the
second
circuit
pointed
out
in
wright
versus
mcminn,
that
a
determination
had
been
made
administratively
that
haines
was
a
person
that
would
have
abused
those
facilities.
accordingly,
the
case
must
be
remanded
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
such
a
determination
had
ever
been
made
and
it
should
be
noted
in
this
connection
that
there
are
alternatives
to
the
type
of
punishment
that
was
imposed
upon
haines.
this
would
be
entitled
to
some
weight
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
inflictions
in
this
case
were
actually
necessary
for
prison
discipline.
as
the
president’s
crime
commission
pointed
out
in
1967,
one
of
the
things
that
could
be
done
in
a
situation
involving
misbehavior
is
that
the
inmate
should
be
contacted
by
members
of
the
staff
concerned
with
this
classification
in
counseling
which
can
include
chaplains,
case
workers
and
persons
of
that
sort.
they
should
discuss
with
him
the
causes
and
consequences
of
his
misbehavior
trying
to
reach
agreement
on
what
the
causes
are
and
how
they
may
be
corrected.
so
that
instead
of
blandly
imposing
a
subtle
or
not
so
subtle
form
of
corporal
punishment,
they
ought
to
try
to
get
through
to
the
man’s
mind
and
find
out
why
his
attitudes
are
the
way
they
are.
in
this
case,
it
is
quite
possible
that
would
finally
ascertain
that
haines
was
reacting
in
self-defense
and
was
not
the
aggressor.
and
as
we
find
from
some
of
the
returns
to
our
questionnaire
from
some
of
the
departments
of
corrections,
many
persons
are
saying
we
use
solitary
confinement
only
as
a
last
resort
when
other
alternatives
are
not
availing.
perhaps
one
approach
that
–-
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well
he
refused
to
explain
his
actions.
i
will
get
to
that
in
a
moment
as
to
why
he
was
affectively
precluded
from
talking
about
self-defense
at
that
point.
that
is
the
second
point
involving
due
process.
with
respect
to
the
first
point,
perhaps
the
best
approach
would
be
for
this
court
to
adopt
the
procedure
utilized
in
the
eastern
district
of
arkansas
with
respect
the
whipping
cases.
first
case,
tally
versus
stevens
held
that
there
must
be
procedural
safeguards
surrounding
the
infliction
of
corporal
punishment
in
order
to
minimize
abuse.
interestingly,
none
are
shown
here.
that
is
we
do
not
know
whether
or
not
they
are
illinois
regulations
requiring
a
doctor
to
certify
that
a
person
is
fit
to
take
certain
types
of
confinement.
there
is
no
showing
that
there
is
administrative
review
of
low
racial
armed
personnel
nor
that
any
showing
that
haines'
physical
condition
was
given
any
weight
whatsoever
in
the
determination
that
he
should
be
subjected
to
this
type
of
punishment.
of
course
this
is
a
determination
for
the
prison
officials
not
the
courts
to
make.
however,
there
is
no
showing
that
prison
officials
made
such
an
informed
showing
on
this
record,
and
therefore,
the
case
must
be
remanded.
as
the
fourth
circuit
pointed
out
in
brown
versus
payton
while
the
judgments
of
prison
officials
are
entitled
to
considerable
weight,
prison
officials
are
not
judges
and
are
not
charged
with
responsibility
of
enforcing
the
constitution
and
they
are
not
always
disinterested
persons.
we
do
not
denigrate
there
views,
but
cannot
be
absolutely
bound
by
them.
the
second
approach
that
might
be
taken
would
be
to
hold
as
in
jackson
versus
bishop
that
there
are
such
practices
that
so
contravene
civilized
standards
as
to
constitute
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
per
se.
for
example,
there
is
no
showing
at
all
that
any
legitimate
interest
is
served
by
keeping
people
in
dark
cells.
nor
is
there
any
showing
that
prisons
could
not
be
loaned
the
personal
articles
of
hygiene
which
is
then
be
returned
back
to
the
officials
so
that
a
person
would
not
be
able
to
make
weapons
or
razor
blades
or
things
of
that
sort.
nor
is
there
any
showing
that
it
is
impossible
to
construct
the
bed
that
cannot
be
taken
apart
by
a
prisoner.
nor
is
there
a
showing
that
it
is
impossible
to
have
medical
visitation
or
to
have
exercise.
but
we
think
that
a
remand
should
be
held
in
this
case
in
order
to
fully
develop
the
record
as
to
exactly
what
alternatives
were
available
to
the
state
and
whether
or
not
the
inflictions
in
this
case
were
actually
necessary.
we
are
not
seeking
final
judgment
here,
but
only
a
chance
to
prove
that
haines
was
in
effect
treated
as
rubbish.
the
second
claim
which
is
the
procedural
due
process
claim
is
as
follows.
mr.
haines
points
out
that
no
statement
of
reasons
was
ever
given
for
the
punishment
and
there
is
the
chance
that
he
may
have
been
penalized
for
exercising
his
right
to
remain
silent.
he
was
under
dilemma
of
talking
and
possibly
incriminating
himself
or
not
talking
and
thereby
suffering
punishment.
as
we
pointed
out
this
was
–-
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
i
was
leading
for
another
point
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
to
the
extent
to
which
the
federal
courts
might
defer
to
administer
determinations
which
are
based
upon
sound
procedural
basis
then
it
may
be
that
if
it
can
be
shown
that
there
were
statements
of
reasons
that
they
are
adequate
procedures,
the
federal
courts
might
then
not
undertake
to
review
every
single
situation,
but
what
we
have
as
here
a
situation
where
no
reasons
were
given
without
any
explanations
to
whether
or
not
that
would
have
been
impossible.
actually
many
prison
officials
could
give
reasons
for
punishment.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
i
believe
some
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
the
alternatives
to
no
reason
is
that
the
federal
courts
will
then
have
sufficient
to
the
cases
is
to
determine
what
the
reasons
were
applied.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
in
order
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
there
was
an
impermissible
basis
of
punishment.
if
he
was
penalized
for
taking
the
fifth
amendment,
that
would
be
negligible.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
in
the
event
that
the
court
does
not
require
a
statement
of
reasons
be
given
that
it
would
be
necessary
then
in
individual
cases
to
ascertain
exactly
what
the
basis
was.
if
an
inmate
claims
that
the
reason
that
he
was
punished
was
because
he
engaged
in
protected
activities
such
as
filing
writs
against
the
warden
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
why
he
is
punished
at
all
or
why
he
was
punished
to
the
extent
to
which
he
was
punished?
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
we
would
simply
submit
that
it
may
be
required
by
due
process
and
perhaps
more
important,
it
will
enable
to
federal
courts
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
the
case
does
present
the
constitutional
infirmity
raised
by
the
prisoner,
but
in
any
of
that
we
would
suggest
that
the
way
that
the
dilemma
that
the
inmate
has
can
be
resolved
is
suggested
by
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
decision
in
nelson
versus
hart.
there,
there
was
a
man
on
federal
parole
that
was
arrested
for
a
new
offense.
it
was
sort
of
continuance
of
the
federal
parole
revocation
proceeding
on
the
ground
he
might
incriminate
himself.
the
circuit
court
said
there
was
no
need
for
a
continuance
because
they
would
adopt
an
implicit
use
immunity
rule
saying
anything
that
he
said
in
the
revocation
proceeding
would
be
ipso
facto
inadmissible
in
the
criminal
case.
under
those
circumstances
that
removes
the
legitimate
fear
self-incrimination.
if
it
has
been
fairly
demonstrated
to
the
prisoner
that
he
has
no
fifth
amendment
problem,
he
could
then
talk.
in
this
situation
there
is
no
showing
that
haines
do
of
any
implicit
use
immunity
nor
that
he
was
advised
by
this.
now,
the
appointment
of
counsel
might
suffice
or
simple
admonition
by
the
administrative
officials
might
suffice.
on
this
record
we
certainly
cannot
presume
a
waiver
that
he
intentionally
relinquished
that
right
knowing
that
he
had
such
a
right
and
under
the
circumstances
the
case
must
be
remanded
for
a
determination.
in
addition,
while
haines
raised
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
his
good
time
was
properly
taken
away.
we
think
candidly
that,
that
issue
really
is
not
relevant
to
this
case
for
the
following
reason.
in
illinois
life
prisoners
are
entitled
to
be
considered
for
parole
at
the
end
of
20
years
minus
good
time.
but
haines
did
not
need
that
good
time
because
his
20
years
were
up
in
1959.
therefore,
the
only
question
related
to
his
release
is
whether
or
not
the
parole
board
might
have
taken
this
disciplinary
proceeding
into
consideration
in
denying
him
parole
in
1968.
for
the
court’s
information,
mr.
haines
in
june
of
1971
was
paroled
effective
july
6,
contingent
upon
acceptance
by
the
veteran’s
hospital
if
the
detainer
was
not
exercised
against
him.
well,
unfortunately
the
veteran’s
hospital
has
not
chosen
to
accept
him
and
that
is
the
problem
that
remains
to
be
worked
up,
but
he
still
has
a
damage
claim
in
this
case
that
must
be
resolved.
he
does
say
that
he
suffered
physical
injuries
and
pain
and
suffering
as
result
of
being
in
that
solitary
cell
and
under
the
circumstances
that
he
has
a
clear
right
under
section
1983
under
monroe
versus
pape
to
come
into
this
court
and
seek
relief.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will
save
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
respondents
are
not
asking
this
court
to
act
as
a
trial
court
by
bringing
in
exhibits
or
by
making
certain
statements
about
policies.
our
position
is
that
the
case
should
be
remanded
so
that
a
full
record
could
be
made
in
the
trial
court.
secondly,
it
is
our
position
that
the
state
does
not
have
a
right
to
jeopardize
inmate's
health
without
showing
necessity,
without
showing
some
reliable
procedural
safeguards.
it
is
not
irrelevant
to
know
the
effect
upon
any
potential
rehabilitation
as
the
point
that
jackson
versus
fischer
pointed
out
when
a
inmate
perceives
cruel
and
unusual
punishment,
it
makes
it
much
more
difficult
to
socialize
it.
our
the
final
remark
is
that
with
respect
to
such
questions
to
shave
and
shower,
haines
did
allege
“there
was
no
articles
of
hygiene”
furnished
to
him
and
it
would
seem
to
me
under
a
liberal
construction
that
one
might
then
put
the
burden
on
the
state
to
come
forward
and
say
exactly
what
you
did
supply
him
and
under
the
circumstances
we
feel
that
the
record
must
be
developed
more
fully
and
that
the
case
should
be
remanded
to
the
district
court,
thank
you.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
which
affirmed
the
dismissal
of
a
pro
se
action
brought
by
an
illinois
prisoner
against
prison
officials
and
others
under
42
u.s.c.
section
1983
seeking
damages
and
other
relief
for
injuries
resulting
from
allegedly
unconstitutional
disciplinary
treatment.
the
district
court
granted
the
respondent
officials'
motion
to
dismiss
without
allowing
relief
to
amend
or
to
amplify,
without
directing
an
answer
from
the
defendants,
without
allowing
discovery,
without
a
point
to
counsel
as
some
other
person
to
assist
the
petitioner
and
without
conducting
any
hearing.
the
facts
are
basically
as
follows.
in
1968,
haines
was
then
66
years
old,
was
an
inmate
of
the
illinois
state
penitentiary
serving
a
life
sentence
imposed
for
burglary
as
habitual
offender
which
was
imposed
in
1939.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
he
was
in
menard.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
at
the
time
he
had
a
foot
disability
for
which
he
had
been
awarded
compensation
by
the
illinois
industrial
commission.
on
march
10
of
1968,
haines
while
on
work
detail
was
threatened
by
two
younger
inmates
about
30
years
old.
statements
were
made
by
the
other
inmates
to
the
effect
that
the
young
blood
was
taking
over
and
that
the
old
blood
like
haines
was
dying.
haines
did
not
immediately
react
to
these
torrents,
but
obtained
an
inmate
pass
to
go
outside
and
inspect
the
pile
of
cinders.
when
haines
reentered
the
shack,
the
two
younger
inmates
resumed
their
arguments
and
their
threats
stating
that
haines
had
better
watch
out
or
he
would
be
hurt.
again,
haines
did
not
react.
after
haines
entered
the
bathroom,
these
other
inmates
approached
him
in
a
threatening
manner
and
resumed
the
argument.
one
of
the
two
men
asked
him
if
he
wanted
to
start
something,
he
thinks
of
dorothy
and
haines
then
hit
dorothy
with
a
shovel.
subsequently,
there
was
a
scuffle
with
mr.
moore
and
after
that
mr.
haines
was
taken
by
one
of
the
officials
of
the
prison
to
the
solitary
confinement.
sometime
after
that
which
is
not
clear
from
the
complaint,
mr.
haines
was
taken
by
the
defendant
rogers
to
the
disciplinary
officer.
mr.
haines
refused
to
explain
his
actions
other
then
to
acknowledge
he
had
hit
dorothy
with
the
shovel.
he
was
locked
again
in
an
isolation
cell
until
the
report
that
he
had
from
the
defendant
duncan.
sometime
after
that,
it
is
also
not
clear
how
long
the
period
was,
the
report
was
submitted
to
the
disciplinary
committee.
at
that
time
haines
was
brought
before
them
and
objected
to
certain
statements
regarding
his
hitting
the
shovel
on
the
floor.
haines
had
indicated
that
he
had
dislodged
some
dirt
from
the
shovel
and
the
defendant
lance
wanted
to
know
why
plaintiff
would
hit
dorothy
and
stated
that
it
been
28
years
since
mr.
haines
had
been
in
the
hole.
when
plaintiff
refused
to
talk
to
these
officers
he
was
given
15
days
punishment
in
solitary
from
march
10
to
march
25,
1968.
mr.
haines
described
somewhat
the
conditions
of
the
solitary.
he
said
that
it
was
a
dark
cell,
that
he
had
no
bed
or
mattress,
that
he
had
to
sleep
on
the
floor
on
blankets,
that
he
had
received
one
regular
meal
during
the
afternoon
and
some
bread
in
the
morning
and
in
the
evening,
that
there
were
no
personal
articles
of
hygiene,
specifically
no
soap
or
towel
and
that
his
false
teeth
became
so
rancid
he
had
to
take
them
out.
following
his
day
in
solitary
confinement,
mr.
haines
was
demoted
to
c
grade
which
meant
that
he
lost
certain
commissary
privileges
and
other
privileges
which
haines
said
are
not
known
to
him.
although
in
discovery
haines
filed
numerous
requests
for
admissions
and
interrogatories
where
he
sought
to
ascertain
more
information
along
that
line.
the
issues
in
the
case
are
first
whether
or
not
the
district
court
prematurely
dismissed
the
complaint.
secondly,
whether
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
of
this
particular
solitary
confinement
as
applied
for
this
particular
inmate
unjustified
on
this
record
violated
haines'
right
to
be
free
from
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
third,
whether
haines
was
effectively
precluded
from
making
a
defense
or
self-defense
at
the
disciplinary
proceeding
and
finally
there
is
a
question
of
whether
or
not
haines
was
penalized
for
exercising
his
right
to
remain
silent
until
the
existence
of
any
immunity
was
fairly
demonstrated
to
him.
the
issues
that
are
not
involved
in
this
case
are
a
general
attack
upon
solitary
confinement
per
se
under
humane
conditions
and
secondly
whether
or
not
the
application
of
goldberg
versus
kelly
type
of
procedures
apply
to
all
disciplinary
proceedings.
we
deal
in
this
situation
with
the
specific
problem
where
a
man
is
charged
with
a
prosecutable
offense
where
a
self-incrimination
question
must
be
dealt
with.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
the
record
does
not
show
what
happened
to
dorothy
and
moore
in
terms
of
whether
or
not
they
were
punished
or
prosecuted
nor
does
the
record
show
if
haines
was
ever
prosecuted.
i
believe
he
was
not.
the
principles
applicable
to
this
–
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
i
do
not
know.
well,
i
do
know
that
he
was
not
prosecuted
from
talking
to
mr.
haines,
but
i
do
not
know
that
the
other
two
individuals.
but
the
principles
applicable
to
the
eighth
amendment
claim
are
well
stated
in
jackson
versus
fischer
in
the
opinion
by
mr.
justice
blackmun
then
a
circuit
judge.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
we
said
that
there
was
a
disciplinary
hearing.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
the
district
court
summarily
dismiss
under
the
motion
of
the
defendants
to
dismiss.
so
there
is
no
evidence
on
which
we
can
(inaudible)
–-
the
only
thing
we
have
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
which
are
taken
us
true
for
present
purposes
which
must
be
liberally
construed
in
accordance
with
pro
se
of
willing
rule.
quoting
from
the
supreme
court
pronouncements
in
jackson
versus
bishop,
mr.
justice
blackmun
pointed
out
that
the
meaning
of
the
eighth
amendment
is
nothing
less
than
the
dignity
of
man
that
it
is
a
flexible
guarantee
drawing
meaning
from
evolving
standards
of
decency
that
mark
the
progress
of
a
maturing
society,
wanton
infliction
of
pain
and
unnecessary
cruelty
are
barred.
significantly
a
statement
is
made
there
that
brought
an
idealistic
concept
of
dignity,
civilized
standards,
humanity
and
decency
are
useful
and
usable
and
as
we
point
out,
the
practices
of
other
jurisdictions,
standards
of
the
american
correctional
association,
the
united
nations
minimum
standards
and
the
views
of
experts
show
that
these
concepts
are
also
practical
and
workable.
this
court
has
not
hesitated
to
strike
down
state
penal
practices
which
contravene
federal
constitutional
guarantees.
younger
versus
gilmore,
cruz
versus
hope,
johnson
versus
avery,
cooper
versus
pate
and
lee
versus
washington,
all
involved
the
cases
where
state
penal
practices
were
held
to
be
inconsistent
with
the
federal
constitution.
it
appears
that
the
respondents
do
fall
back
to
the
position
that
the
action
taken
here
was
actually
necessary
to
the
maintenance
of
prison
discipline
and
security.
but
interestingly
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
to
support
that
conclusion
and
that
is
another
reason
why
the
case
needs
to
be
remanded.
they
suggest
possible
abuse
of
facilities
by
a
person
in
solitary
confinement
as
an
abstract
possibility,
but
nowhere
as
it
is
suggested,
as
the
second
circuit
pointed
out
in
wright
versus
mcminn,
that
a
determination
had
been
made
administratively
that
haines
was
a
person
that
would
have
abused
those
facilities.
accordingly,
the
case
must
be
remanded
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
such
a
determination
had
ever
been
made
and
it
should
be
noted
in
this
connection
that
there
are
alternatives
to
the
type
of
punishment
that
was
imposed
upon
haines.
this
would
be
entitled
to
some
weight
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
inflictions
in
this
case
were
actually
necessary
for
prison
discipline.
as
the
president’s
crime
commission
pointed
out
in
1967,
one
of
the
things
that
could
be
done
in
a
situation
involving
misbehavior
is
that
the
inmate
should
be
contacted
by
members
of
the
staff
concerned
with
this
classification
in
counseling
which
can
include
chaplains,
case
workers
and
persons
of
that
sort.
they
should
discuss
with
him
the
causes
and
consequences
of
his
misbehavior
trying
to
reach
agreement
on
what
the
causes
are
and
how
they
may
be
corrected.
so
that
instead
of
blandly
imposing
a
subtle
or
not
so
subtle
form
of
corporal
punishment,
they
ought
to
try
to
get
through
to
the
man’s
mind
and
find
out
why
his
attitudes
are
the
way
they
are.
in
this
case,
it
is
quite
possible
that
would
finally
ascertain
that
haines
was
reacting
in
self-defense
and
was
not
the
aggressor.
and
as
we
find
from
some
of
the
returns
to
our
questionnaire
from
some
of
the
departments
of
corrections,
many
persons
are
saying
we
use
solitary
confinement
only
as
a
last
resort
when
other
alternatives
are
not
availing.
perhaps
one
approach
that
–-
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well
he
refused
to
explain
his
actions.
i
will
get
to
that
in
a
moment
as
to
why
he
was
affectively
precluded
from
talking
about
self-defense
at
that
point.
that
is
the
second
point
involving
due
process.
with
respect
to
the
first
point,
perhaps
the
best
approach
would
be
for
this
court
to
adopt
the
procedure
utilized
in
the
eastern
district
of
arkansas
with
respect
the
whipping
cases.
first
case,
tally
versus
stevens
held
that
there
must
be
procedural
safeguards
surrounding
the
infliction
of
corporal
punishment
in
order
to
minimize
abuse.
interestingly,
none
are
shown
here.
that
is
we
do
not
know
whether
or
not
they
are
illinois
regulations
requiring
a
doctor
to
certify
that
a
person
is
fit
to
take
certain
types
of
confinement.
there
is
no
showing
that
there
is
administrative
review
of
low
racial
armed
personnel
nor
that
any
showing
that
haines'
physical
condition
was
given
any
weight
whatsoever
in
the
determination
that
he
should
be
subjected
to
this
type
of
punishment.
of
course
this
is
a
determination
for
the
prison
officials
not
the
courts
to
make.
however,
there
is
no
showing
that
prison
officials
made
such
an
informed
showing
on
this
record,
and
therefore,
the
case
must
be
remanded.
as
the
fourth
circuit
pointed
out
in
brown
versus
payton
while
the
judgments
of
prison
officials
are
entitled
to
considerable
weight,
prison
officials
are
not
judges
and
are
not
charged
with
responsibility
of
enforcing
the
constitution
and
they
are
not
always
disinterested
persons.
we
do
not
denigrate
there
views,
but
cannot
be
absolutely
bound
by
them.
the
second
approach
that
might
be
taken
would
be
to
hold
as
in
jackson
versus
bishop
that
there
are
such
practices
that
so
contravene
civilized
standards
as
to
constitute
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
per
se.
for
example,
there
is
no
showing
at
all
that
any
legitimate
interest
is
served
by
keeping
people
in
dark
cells.
nor
is
there
any
showing
that
prisons
could
not
be
loaned
the
personal
articles
of
hygiene
which
is
then
be
returned
back
to
the
officials
so
that
a
person
would
not
be
able
to
make
weapons
or
razor
blades
or
things
of
that
sort.
nor
is
there
any
showing
that
it
is
impossible
to
construct
the
bed
that
cannot
be
taken
apart
by
a
prisoner.
nor
is
there
a
showing
that
it
is
impossible
to
have
medical
visitation
or
to
have
exercise.
but
we
think
that
a
remand
should
be
held
in
this
case
in
order
to
fully
develop
the
record
as
to
exactly
what
alternatives
were
available
to
the
state
and
whether
or
not
the
inflictions
in
this
case
were
actually
necessary.
we
are
not
seeking
final
judgment
here,
but
only
a
chance
to
prove
that
haines
was
in
effect
treated
as
rubbish.
the
second
claim
which
is
the
procedural
due
process
claim
is
as
follows.
mr.
haines
points
out
that
no
statement
of
reasons
was
ever
given
for
the
punishment
and
there
is
the
chance
that
he
may
have
been
penalized
for
exercising
his
right
to
remain
silent.
he
was
under
dilemma
of
talking
and
possibly
incriminating
himself
or
not
talking
and
thereby
suffering
punishment.
as
we
pointed
out
this
was
–-
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
i
was
leading
for
another
point
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
to
the
extent
to
which
the
federal
courts
might
defer
to
administer
determinations
which
are
based
upon
sound
procedural
basis
then
it
may
be
that
if
it
can
be
shown
that
there
were
statements
of
reasons
that
they
are
adequate
procedures,
the
federal
courts
might
then
not
undertake
to
review
every
single
situation,
but
what
we
have
as
here
a
situation
where
no
reasons
were
given
without
any
explanations
to
whether
or
not
that
would
have
been
impossible.
actually
many
prison
officials
could
give
reasons
for
punishment.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
i
believe
some
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
the
alternatives
to
no
reason
is
that
the
federal
courts
will
then
have
sufficient
to
the
cases
is
to
determine
what
the
reasons
were
applied.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
in
order
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
there
was
an
impermissible
basis
of
punishment.
if
he
was
penalized
for
taking
the
fifth
amendment,
that
would
be
negligible.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
in
the
event
that
the
court
does
not
require
a
statement
of
reasons
be
given
that
it
would
be
necessary
then
in
individual
cases
to
ascertain
exactly
what
the
basis
was.
if
an
inmate
claims
that
the
reason
that
he
was
punished
was
because
he
engaged
in
protected
activities
such
as
filing
writs
against
the
warden
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
why
he
is
punished
at
all
or
why
he
was
punished
to
the
extent
to
which
he
was
punished?
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
we
would
simply
submit
that
it
may
be
required
by
due
process
and
perhaps
more
important,
it
will
enable
to
federal
courts
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
the
case
does
present
the
constitutional
infirmity
raised
by
the
prisoner,
but
in
any
of
that
we
would
suggest
that
the
way
that
the
dilemma
that
the
inmate
has
can
be
resolved
is
suggested
by
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
decision
in
nelson
versus
hart.
there,
there
was
a
man
on
federal
parole
that
was
arrested
for
a
new
offense.
it
was
sort
of
continuance
of
the
federal
parole
revocation
proceeding
on
the
ground
he
might
incriminate
himself.
the
circuit
court
said
there
was
no
need
for
a
continuance
because
they
would
adopt
an
implicit
use
immunity
rule
saying
anything
that
he
said
in
the
revocation
proceeding
would
be
ipso
facto
inadmissible
in
the
criminal
case.
under
those
circumstances
that
removes
the
legitimate
fear
self-incrimination.
if
it
has
been
fairly
demonstrated
to
the
prisoner
that
he
has
no
fifth
amendment
problem,
he
could
then
talk.
in
this
situation
there
is
no
showing
that
haines
do
of
any
implicit
use
immunity
nor
that
he
was
advised
by
this.
now,
the
appointment
of
counsel
might
suffice
or
simple
admonition
by
the
administrative
officials
might
suffice.
on
this
record
we
certainly
cannot
presume
a
waiver
that
he
intentionally
relinquished
that
right
knowing
that
he
had
such
a
right
and
under
the
circumstances
the
case
must
be
remanded
for
a
determination.
in
addition,
while
haines
raised
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
his
good
time
was
properly
taken
away.
we
think
candidly
that,
that
issue
really
is
not
relevant
to
this
case
for
the
following
reason.
in
illinois
life
prisoners
are
entitled
to
be
considered
for
parole
at
the
end
of
20
years
minus
good
time.
but
haines
did
not
need
that
good
time
because
his
20
years
were
up
in
1959.
therefore,
the
only
question
related
to
his
release
is
whether
or
not
the
parole
board
might
have
taken
this
disciplinary
proceeding
into
consideration
in
denying
him
parole
in
1968.
for
the
court’s
information,
mr.
haines
in
june
of
1971
was
paroled
effective
july
6,
contingent
upon
acceptance
by
the
veteran’s
hospital
if
the
detainer
was
not
exercised
against
him.
well,
unfortunately
the
veteran’s
hospital
has
not
chosen
to
accept
him
and
that
is
the
problem
that
remains
to
be
worked
up,
but
he
still
has
a
damage
claim
in
this
case
that
must
be
resolved.
he
does
say
that
he
suffered
physical
injuries
and
pain
and
suffering
as
result
of
being
in
that
solitary
cell
and
under
the
circumstances
that
he
has
a
clear
right
under
section
1983
under
monroe
versus
pape
to
come
into
this
court
and
seek
relief.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will
save
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
respondents
are
not
asking
this
court
to
act
as
a
trial
court
by
bringing
in
exhibits
or
by
making
certain
statements
about
policies.
our
position
is
that
the
case
should
be
remanded
so
that
a
full
record
could
be
made
in
the
trial
court.
secondly,
it
is
our
position
that
the
state
does
not
have
a
right
to
jeopardize
inmate's
health
without
showing
necessity,
without
showing
some
reliable
procedural
safeguards.
it
is
not
irrelevant
to
know
the
effect
upon
any
potential
rehabilitation
as
the
point
that
jackson
versus
fischer
pointed
out
when
a
inmate
perceives
cruel
and
unusual
punishment,
it
makes
it
much
more
difficult
to
socialize
it.
our
the
final
remark
is
that
with
respect
to
such
questions
to
shave
and
shower,
haines
did
allege
“there
was
no
articles
of
hygiene”
furnished
to
him
and
it
would
seem
to
me
under
a
liberal
construction
that
one
might
then
put
the
burden
on
the
state
to
come
forward
and
say
exactly
what
you
did
supply
him
and
under
the
circumstances
we
feel
that
the
record
must
be
developed
more
fully
and
that
the
case
should
be
remanded
to
the
district
court,
thank
you.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
