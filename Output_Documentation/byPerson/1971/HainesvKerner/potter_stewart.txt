justice
potter
stewart
mr.
bass,
he
was
--
in
fact
that
no
reasons
were
given
for
the
punishment
really
does
not
make
this
case
very
unusual?
in
that
sense
the
as
a
general
rule
in
ordinary
and
criminal
prosecution
after
a
conviction,
the
sentencing
judge
quite
often
does
not
give
reasons
why
you
got
one
sentence
rather
than
another,
is
that
not
true?
justice
potter
stewart
not
such
a
procedural
due
process
claim?
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
give
reasons
why
they
impose
ten
days
in
solitary
confinement
rather
than
12
or
rather
than
eight?
justice
potter
stewart
if
so
this
makes
it
much
different
from
the
ordinary
criminal
process
where
no
states,
where
juries
set
the
punishment,
no
reason
is
ever
given
and/or
ascertainable
and
in
those
state,
those
jurisdictions
where
the
federal
judge
or
where
the
judge
in
a
federal
system
or
in
the
state
systems
where
the
judge
imposes
the
punishment,
he
quite
typically
does
not
give
reasons
why
he
imposes
a
sentence
of
two
years
rather
two-and-a-half
or
three
rather
than
one-and-a-half.
justice
potter
stewart
why?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
whole
--
in
reviewing
state
criminal
convictions
and
federal
criminal
convictions.
this
court
and
most
reviewing
courts
are
entirely
without
power
to
look
into
the
punishments
so
long
as
it
is
within
permissible
limits
and
generally
no
reason
is
given
by
the
one
who
imposes
the
sentence?
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
as
to
why
he
was
punished
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
is
the
second
part
that
i
do
not
understand.
justice
potter
stewart
were
the
prison
regulations
published
and
disseminated
upon
the
prison
population?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
rule
19
or
is
it
the
guidebook?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
with
the
same
--
same
utensil?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
a
toilet
and
a
wash
basin?
justice
potter
stewart
well
then
you
say
that
is
a
policy,
you
are
just
telling
us
that?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
maximum
consecutive
number
of
days?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
after
24
hours
or
so
can
he
spend
another,
can
he
be
put
in
there
for
another
15
days?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
he
could
spend
30
or
31
days
or
60
days
or
62
days
or
240
or
244
days
in
isolation,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
well
it
does
not
happen
very
often
i
suppose
(voice
overlap)
why
is
not
imposed.
justice
potter
stewart
have
been
inadequate?
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
you
mean
that?
justice
potter
stewart
or
of
inadequate
heat
or
ventilation?
justice
potter
stewart
may
pass,
what
does
that
mean?
justice
potter
stewart
pass
means,
we
will
overlook
this?
is
