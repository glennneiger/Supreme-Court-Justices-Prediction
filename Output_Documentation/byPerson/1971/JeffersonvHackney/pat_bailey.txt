mr.
pat
bailey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
counsel
has
stated
that
there
are
initially
to
questions
presented
in
this
case.
your
first
a
constitutional
question
involving
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
this
is
based
upon
the
manner
and
which
the
texas
legislature
has
allocated
the
money
available
between
the
various
categories
of
welfare
assistance
in
texas,
the
aged,
the
blind
and
totally
disabled
and
the
dependent
children.
the
statutory
claim
deals
with
whether
the
allocation
of
the
money
between
these
categories
by
the
legislature
violates
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
also,
the
federal
statutory
issue
of
whether
the
texas
method
of
determining
eligibility
violates
the
social
security
act
and
in
particular
42
u.s.c.
section
602
(a)
23.
also,
i
think
we
have
in
this
case
an
additional
issue
of
an
old
age
by
the
appellants
and
that
is
whether
there
is
any
just
issue
controversy
appellant
and
appellees
as
to
the
statutory
grounds
allege.
i
think
that
it
would
help
the
court
somewhat
if
we
look
a
little
in
the
background
of
these
welfare
programs
in
texas.
the
texas
constitution
prohibits
gifts
to
individuals.
this
welfare
program
that
texas
has
had
been
authorized
by
amendments
to
the
constitution
which
allows
these
grants
to
be
made
to
needy
individual.
these
amendments
have
all
ways
which
authorized
these
grants
have
always
put
a
limit
upon
how
much
money
that
legislature
of
texas
been
appropriate
to
pay
these
grants
and
packed
up
until
1965.
they
even
put
a
limit
on
how
much
they
could
appropriate
for
various
wants
of
the
program.
however,
in
1965
this
was
gone
away
with
before
the
legislature
could
appropriate
different
varying
sums,
as
they
solved
it,
between
the
various
categories
were
in
operation.
mr.
pat
bailey
yes,
sir.
at
the
time
this
suit
began
it
was
$60
million
during
the
course
of
the
litigation
and
in
fact,
shortly
after
the
initial
judgment
was
entered,
the
people
of
the
state
raised
its
ceiling
to
$80
million.
the
bulk
of
which
went
to
the
afdc
program.
mr.
pat
bailey
yes
sir.
now,
--
mr.
pat
bailey
no
sir,
it’s
an
actual
figure.
it
has
been
gradually
going
up
somewhat
stop
the
time,
i
believe
the
last
attempt
before
the
one
it
was
passed
was
defeated.
so,
at
least
if
not
always
passed
the
vote
of
people.
mr.
pat
bailey
its
own
general
election
[voice
overlap]
the
legislature’s
constitutional
amendments
to
the
people
and
they
vote
on
them
either
passing
them
or
reject
it.
mr.
pat
bailey
yes,
sir.
now,
the
legislature
in
texas
meets
only
ever
two
years
except
on
special
session
and
normally
the
money
is
appropriated
on
a
two-year
basis
or
two-year
period.
now,
the
constitutional
amendments
can
only
be
submitted
pursuant
to
a
regular
session
which
means
if
we
get
in
a
process
financial
wise
we
can’t
call
a
special
session
and
submit
a
constitutional
amendment
and
get
more
money.
we’re
on
sort
of
a
two-year
basis.
now,
texas
in
the
late
60’s
and
starting
really
about
1968
like
many
other
states
had
various
regulations
dealing
with
add-ons
like
a
man-in-the-house,
maximum
grants,
and
certain
rest
of
performance.
the
court
decisions
that
began
to
come
about
in
this
period
of
time
resulted
in
a
dramatic
increase
in
welfare
rolls
but
mainly
in
afdc,
the
category
that
this
litigation
is
directed
at.
now,
the
result
or
consequence
of
this
was
that
we
had
it
constitutionally
fixed
the
amount
of
money
to
spend.
we
had
two-year
appropriation
to
work
with.
there
was
no
way
to
rapidly
it
meant
the
state
constitution
or
any
assurance
it’s
a
voters
would
to
make
more
money
available.
there
was
no
way
or
there
is
no
way
to
transfer
appropriations
between
these
categories
unless
the
legislature
does
it.
the
only
thing
that
could
happen
was
it
grants
and
some
of
the
categories
have
to
be
lowered,
the
ones
that
arose
or
raising
it
rapidly
in.
we
have
the
added
problem
that
this
time
is
it
the
cost
of
living
increase
required
by
the
social
security
act
became
effective
july
1,
1969.
texas
faced
with
its
problem
went
to
the
solution
at
some
states
were
using
in
one
that
the
department
of
hew
was
authorizing
that
up
going
to
a
ratable
reduction
method
where
we
recognized
this
standard
of
living
inquiries
but
we
can
only
pay
a
percentage
of
this.
texas
had
to
reduce
some
of
the
grants
as
a
result
of
using
this
rightful
reduction
system
and
it
was
because
of
this
the
either
reduction
of
some
of
the
individual’s
grants
or
the
fact
that
they
did
not
increase
that
actually
triggered
this
lawsuit.
now,
let’s
initially
look
at
the
constitutional
claim.
they
are
complaining
that
the
allocation
of
the
legislature
of
texas
that
made
between
this
various
categories
of
assistance
is
in
violation
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it’s
really
a
two-fold
crust,
i
think
in
here.
one
is
that,
we
are
not
saying
the
same
percentage
of
need
between
the
various
categories
and
they
say
there
should
be
no
various.
now,
in
the
aged
program,
we
paid
a
100%
as
to
the
blind
and
disabled
95%.
at
the
time
of
this
lawsuit,
50%
in
afdc.
this
is
about
--
mr.
pat
bailey
the
welfare
department,
your
honor,
on
the
basis
that
they
have
to
figure
how
much
money
they
had
and
how
much
they
were
going
to
pay
at?
mr.
pat
bailey
yes,
sir.
mr.
pat
bailey
the
legislature
did
this
and
the
welfare
department
of
course
then
has
to
take
the
money
that’s
in
the
program
and
say,
we’ve
got
so
many
people,
24
months
--
mr.
pat
bailey
within
the
budget,
yes,
your
honor.
now,
this
because
of
the
constitutional
amendment,
it
was
pass
raising
the
60
million
and
80
million.
we
have
since
been
able
to
increase
the
percentages
from
50%
to
75%
prior
to
time
and
will
shortly
after
this
suit
commenced.
mr.
pat
bailey
no,
sir.
they
stated
the
blind
and
disabled
were
stayed
at
95%
and
the
old
age
assistance
remained
at
100%.
mr.
pat
bailey
the
appellants
have
also
raised
the
allegation
that
this
allocation
found
between
the
category
has
some
form
of
racial
motivation
or
effect.
now,
as
to
the
contentions,
the
court
below
has
twice
rejected
it.
i
think
that
as
to
this
initial
argument
that
king
v.
smith
and
dandridge
v.
william
have
already
decided
this
initial
issue
adversely
to
the
appellants.
the
court
is
recognized
in
these
cases
that
the
state
have
considerable
latitude
in
allocating
their
afdc
resources.
i
think
this
court
has
said
that
each
state
is
free
to
set
its
own
standard
of
need
and
to
determine
the
level
of
benefits
by
the
amount
affirms
it
devotes
to
the
program.
i
don’t
believe
that
the
court
could
make
it
much
clear
that
the
states
can
use
their
discretion
as
to
what
particular
problem
in
the
welfare
area
that
the
state
wants
to
concentrate
upon
and
use
their
limited
funds
to
do
the
best
job
they
can.
i
think
the
court
below
recognized
this
when
they
saw
that
texas
only
had
a
limited
amount
of
money
and
they
felt
that
it
was
the
duty
of
the
legislature
of
the
state
to
use
its
judgment
in
the
manner
in
the
amount
the
available
money
should
be
divided.
i
think
that
the
court
below
possibly
look
to
this
court’s
warning
in
dandridge
v.
williams
where
the
court
stated
that
the
constitution
does
not
empower
the
court
to
second
guess
state
officials
charged
with
the
difficult
responsibility
of
allocating
limited
public
welfare
funds
among
the
merit
of
potential
recipients.
we
feel
that
to
do
otherwise
really
would
put
the
court
down
in
the
position
of
exercising
a
legislative
rather
than
a
judicial
function.
now,
i
think
that
without
commenting
at
length
upon
them,
there
are
numerous
reasons
which
are
constitutionally
sufficient
for
spending
less
in
one
program
unless
you
just
look
at
the
afdc
program
as
opposed
to
other
programs.
the
courts
have
long
recognized
that
these
are
different
programs
with
different
objectives.
secondly,
the
aged,
the
blind
and
the
disabled
are
not
luckily
going
to
improve
their
condition,
in
many
cases,
will
only
worsen.
these
people
are
also
quite
frequently
the
recipients
of
larger
amounts
of
drugs
or
medical
needs.
i
think
that
this
is
one
that
the
legislature
could
have
considered
as
wanting
to
devote
more
of
their
energy,
more
of
the
available
funds
in
this
area
as
opposed
to
another
and
not
necessarily
feeling
that
the
child
or
the
blind
or
someone
else
should
suffer
but
realizing
that
they
couldn’t
create
a
utopia
either
with
the
money
that
they
had.
mr.
pat
bailey
about
$23
million,
a
little
over
$23
million.
so
it
would
be
a
somewhere
around
close
to
30%
in
our
record
--
mr.
pat
bailey
out
of
the
$80
million,
i
believe
in
the
last
appropriation.
mr.
pat
bailey
i
would
have
to
look
your
honor.
i
believe
there
is
around
$50
million
goes
to
the
old
age
assistance
program.
the
blind
program
is
rather
small
--
mr.
pat
bailey
yes,
sir
and
in
aptd
is
also
risen
some
but
not
too
much
although
this
is
rapidly
growing
one.
but
the
remainder
of
the
money
about
the
$7
million
about
approximately
remaining
is
divided
between
the
blind
and
the
disabled.
mr.
pat
bailey
yes,
sir.
mr.
pat
bailey
i
think
it’s
probably
correct,
i
have
--
mr.
pat
bailey
now,
the
--
mr.
pat
bailey
yes,
sir.
mr.
pat
bailey
yes,
sir.
mr.
pat
bailey
this
is
correct
sir
either
one
is
a
correct.
now,
the
appellants
in
this
case
have
also
questioned
the
use
of
the
traditionally
equal
protection
test
by
the
court
below
rather
than
a
compelling
interest
test.
i
think
that
dandridge
v.
williams
decides
the
question
that
unless
there
are
some
showing
or
in
the
rule
of
a
regulation
and
there’s
a
racial
motivation
or
fact
that
the
compelling
interest
statute
should
not
come
in
to
play
unless
this
is
shown.
this
i
think
brings
us
both
to
this
question
into
the
civil
rights
question.
the
appellants
have
contended
that
this
allocation
is
because
of
some
racial
intent.
i
think
the
undisputed
facts
in
the
record
before
this
court
show
that
this
allegation
is
with
out
merit
in
the
court
below
has
on
two
in
occasions
so
held.
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
it
a
little
bit
of
the
facts
since
here.
they’ve
never
been
a
reduction
in
afdc
(inaudible).
the
amount
of
increase
is
over
the
last
28
years
have
almost
been
equal
from
the
standpoint
of
every
time
some
of
the
adult
categories
were
raised
in
money,
so
with
the
afdc
program.
mr.
pat
bailey
yes
sir,
in
total.
mr.
pat
bailey
the
afdc?
mr.
pat
bailey
yes,
your
honor,
there
have
been
over
the
history
of
these
programs
reductions
and
practically
every
one
of
them
at
one
time
or
another
either
by
the
legislature
not
appropriating
money
and
the
programs
growing
there
have
to
be
some
reductions
from
time
to
time
but
never
in
the
total
amount
of
money
spent
for
the
programs.
mr.
pat
bailey
since
1943,
the
afdc
program
has
been
growing
about
twice
as
fast
as
the
adult
programs.
the
majority
of
the
families
receiving
actually
an
increase
under
this
ratable
reduction
theory
that
texas
went
to
in
69
were
actually
large
families
which
were
predominantly
they
grow
in
mexican-american.
under
this
proposed
amendment
which
passed
increase
the
money
available
sum
$20
million
of
the
amount
that
was
appropriated
by
the
legislature.
the
afdc
got
almost
$12
million
out
of
the
$15
million
available.
also,
the
court
looking
at
the
depositions
of
the
welfare
department
officials
said
that
these
people
didn’t
even
know
what
the
racial
make
ups
of
the
various
category
was
until
after
this
suit
commenced
and
they
were
required
to
do
certain
studies
and
come
up
with
certain
statistics.
another
thing
that
we
get
in
to
here
if
we
talk
about
leveling
this
out,
if
we
took
and
these
are
stipulations
in
this
case,
if
we
took
this
money
and
leveled
it
out,
it
would
not
have
a
racial
effect
as
the
appellants
seem
to
contend.
it
would
mean
that
practically
and
equal
amount
of
racial
groups
in
the
adult
program,
the
aged,
the
blind,
and
the
disabled
would
have
their
grants
lowered
to
in
turn
it
raised
about
the
same
amount
of
individuals
in
this
ethnic
groups
in
the
afdc
program.
now,
if
this
was
not
the
case,
they
might
be
some
merit
to
appellant’s
contention
but
leveling
this
out
has
no
racial
connotation
because
they’re
going
to
be
as
many
people
in
the
mexican-american
and
the
negroes
that
will
have
their
grants
lower
than
this
other
programs
as
well
have
them
raised
in
afdc
and
i
think
this
itself
shows
the
lack
of
merit
in
appellants’
contention.
mr.
pat
bailey
i
have
and
not
a
word
in
the
record
nor
i
have
really
looked
to
see
what
the
percentage
difference
it
would
be
but
when
we’re
talking
about
people.
you’re
having
about
as
many
heart
as
you’re
having
held
among
the
latitudes.
i
think
that
king
and
dandridge
show
us
that
the
states
have
a
lot
of
latitude
in
the
way
they
allocate
this
money.
we
submit
also
that
there
was
no
racial
motivation
or
effect
in
what
has
been
done
in
the
allocation.
there
are
some
four
other
cases
the
lampton
out
of
louisiana,
the
ward
case
in
mississippi,
the
goodwin
case
out
of
new
york,
the
stanley
case
out
of
virginia
which
all
got
percentages
about
the
sign
are
very
strikingly
similar.
and
to
date,
i
am
not
aware
of
the
court
saying
that
this
show
racial
effect
or
motivation.
now,
as
to
the
statutory
question,
the
initial
attack
in
this
case
was
at
the
ratable
reduction
of
paying
only
a
percentage
of
this
recognize
need
was
paid.
however,
before
this
case
rates
this
court,
the
issue
was
resolved
by
rosado.
now,
there
was
no
pleadings
or
proof
or
allegations
in
the
trial
on
the
first
appeal
about
anything
that
texas
was
doing
wrong
in
its
method
of
determining
eligibility.
it
was
only
after
the
court,
this
court
sent
the
case
back
for
the
entry
of
a
new
judgment
and
after
the
court
had
entered
the
judgment
denying
both
the
constitutional
and
statutory
relives
of
by
the
appellants
that
they
raised
for
the
first
time
this
question
of
whether
or
not
texas
was
properly
determining
eligibility.
there
were
no
amended
pleadings
efforts
to
amend
their
pleadings.
none
of
the
appellants
before
this
court
were
affected
by
the
way
eligibility
was
determined.
the
only
party
which
could’ve
been
affected
was
the
party
davilla
but
she
didn’t
even
appeal
from
the
first
judgment
entered
by
the
court
and
was
no
longer
a
party
to
the
case
when
it
was
sent
back
for
the
entry
for
a
new
judgment
or
when
this
issue
as
to
determining
eligibility
was
first
raised
in
a
motion
to
amend
the
judgment
entered
by
the
court.
mr.
pat
bailey
well,
your
honor
we
feel
that
none
of
these
people
in
this
case.
mr.
pat
bailey
all
that
i
can
understand
by
what
they
have
said
here
your
honor,
is
that
the
possibility
that
some
day
in
the
future
this
person
might
become
ineligible.
this
shows
no
controversy.
the
only
thing
that
i
believe
counsel
said
is
that
if
the
court
could
let
this
issue
get
in
here,
this
person
might
have
a
--
mr.
pat
bailey
none
of
these
particular
appellants,
your
honor
are
ineligible
for
any
of
the
medical
assistance
programs
in
texas.
and
this
is
the
issue
that
we
raise
here
is
that
we
feel
that
none
of
these
people
have
been
in
anyway
affected.
mr.
pat
bailey
none
of
the
class
your
honor
that
they
represent
has
been
affected
and
i
think
that
counsel
and
the
appellants
are
in
most
unusual
position
here.
they
are
arguing
for
a
position
which
if
granted
by
this
court
will
actually
lower
their
benefits.
now,
this
is
a
most
strange
position
i
think
for
the
appellants
to
be
in
because
if
a
great
many
more
people
were
put
only
welfare
rolls
in
texas,
these
particular
appellants
would
have
to
have
their
benefits
reduced
and
i
think
this
is
a
somewhat
unique
situation
for
the
appellants
to
come
in
the
court
arguing.
mr.
pat
bailey
yes
sir,
afdc
will
result
in
the
--
mr.
pat
bailey
their
dollar
amounts
would
have
to
go
down
because
if
we
have
more
people
on
the
rose,
we’re
going
to
have
the
same
amount
of
money
is
going
to
have
to
go
further,
so
everyone
that’s
an
appellant
before
this
case.
it
would
have
their
grants.
mr.
pat
bailey
this
might
be
true
your
honor
but
i
think
we
came
back
again
of
the
fact
if
there’s
really
no
controversy
as
to
this
issue
between
the
parties
before
this
court.
what
they’re
really
doing
is
this.
they’ve
lost
–-
the
rosado
caused
them
to
lose
their
statutory
issue
on
this
ratable
reduction
and
the
only
thing
they
got
left
now,
that
they
try
to
jump
in
at
the
lightest
as
many
here,
is
the
fact
that
this
--
the
way
we’re
determining
eligibility,
that
something
that
would
never
in
the
case
until
the
second
judgment
was
entered.
they
got
an
issue
--
mr.
pat
bailey
yes
sir,
what
they’re
saying
in
here
is
that
what
texas
does?
they
apply
this
ratable
reduction
factor
to
the
standard
of
need.
let’s
just
say
it
is
$75.00
and
there’s
a
$100.00
worth
of
need.
it
would
be
$75.00
for
a
particular
individual.
if
they
have
income
of
more
than
$75.00
then
they
are
ineligible.
what
the
appellants
would
like
to
have
happen
here
would
be
for
their
eligibility
to
be
determined
on
the
four
recognized
need.
this
would
in
turn
put
them
showing
a
small
amount
of
unmet
need.
this
would
then
put
them
in
the
welfare
rolls
at
a
small
grant
opening
up
some
certain
benefits.
mr.
pat
bailey
yes,
your
honor.
now,
i
think
that
one
of
the
problems
that
we
run
into
here
when
did
this
is
that
we
are
letting
or
putting
on
the
welfare
rolls
certain
people
who
are
very
marginally
eligible
to
get
certain
benefits.
but
the
result
is,
is
that
we’re
having
to
penalize
the
people
who
need
the
help
the
most
because
it’s
the
people
that
have
no
outside
income
who
have
larger
in
needs
that
are
going
ultimately
have
to
have
their
grant
reduced
to
put
this
marginally
needy
people
on
the
rolls.
now,
i
did
not
think
that
it
was
the
intent
of
congress
in
this
act
to
penalize
the
most
needy.
mr.
pat
bailey
i
don’t
see
how,
your
honor
because
he
is
receiving
a
welfare
grant
and
he
is
receiving
medical
benefits.
now,
if
he
was
not,
if
he
had
been
terminated
and
no
longer
could
get
a
grant,
could
no
longer
get
the
medical
assistance,
then
i
think
your
honor
they
would
have
a
proper
party
before
this
court
but
they
don’t
have
one
yet.
they
wanted
to
change
horses
here
but
they
haven’t
got
anybody
who
will
fit
the
saddle
of
this
new
horse
that
they’ve
got.
i
think
that
really
that
they
have
tried
--
the
appellants
have
tried
to
read
in
to
this
portion
of
the
social
security
act,
that
portion
requiring
this
cost
of
living
adjustment.
a
whole
lot
more
than
congress
ever
intended
to
put
there.
the
court
in
rosado
recognized
that
the
purpose
of
this
was
to
make
the
states
recognized
that
cost
of
living
increases
had
occurred,
that
the
state
should
adjust
to
them,
that
in
turn
it
might
prove
the
states
to
spend
more
money
in
this
area.
but
i
think
that
really
what
they’re
asking
here
is
that
something
new
be
read
into
this
step
that
the
eligibility
requirements
be
change,
the
way
that
the
states
determine
eligibility
and
i
think
that
if
congress
have
intended
this
to
be
the
purpose,
they
would
have
written
in
the
end
a
whole
lot
clearer
than
this
and
not
let
to
adopt
a
hope
that
some
litigant
might
discover
this
hidden
among
this
statute
that
this
was
the
purpose
of
it.
i
think
that
in
conclusion
that
the
question
of
whether
to
help
the
more
at
a
cost
of
the
many
really,
and
this
is
the
argument
that
they’re
making
in
this
case,
is
the
business
of
the
legislative
branch
not
the
judicial.
i
think
that
the
arguments
and
hopes
of
the
appellants
in
this
case
are
ones
that
should
be
pursued
in
the
legislative
and
congressional
halls
rather
than
in
the
courts.
i
think
that
really
what
they
would
like
to
do
is
when
you
strip
all
the
argument
in
the
rhetoric
and
the
clichés
that
are
used
is
that
they
would
really
like
this
court
to
judge
the
wisdom
and
the
propriety
of
the
way
the
legislature
of
texas
has
decided
it
would
spend
the
money
had
available
in
the
welfare
area
and
turn
these
appellants
this
satisfaction
with
this
plan
and
possibly,
if
they
can
get
the
court
to
agree
with
them
in
to
some
form
of
constitutional
or
statutory
prohibition.
i
think
that
the
path
of
this
court
is
clear
and
that
is
to
sustain
the
judgment
of
the
court
below.
thank
you.
mr.
pat
bailey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
counsel
has
stated
that
there
are
initially
to
questions
presented
in
this
case.
your
first
a
constitutional
question
involving
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
this
is
based
upon
the
manner
and
which
the
texas
legislature
has
allocated
the
money
available
between
the
various
categories
of
welfare
assistance
in
texas,
the
aged,
the
blind
and
totally
disabled
and
the
dependent
children.
the
statutory
claim
deals
with
whether
the
allocation
of
the
money
between
these
categories
by
the
legislature
violates
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
also,
the
federal
statutory
issue
of
whether
the
texas
method
of
determining
eligibility
violates
the
social
security
act
and
in
particular
42
u.s.c.
section
602
(a)
23.
also,
i
think
we
have
in
this
case
an
additional
issue
of
an
old
age
by
the
appellants
and
that
is
whether
there
is
any
just
issue
controversy
appellant
and
appellees
as
to
the
statutory
grounds
allege.
i
think
that
it
would
help
the
court
somewhat
if
we
look
a
little
in
the
background
of
these
welfare
programs
in
texas.
the
texas
constitution
prohibits
gifts
to
individuals.
this
welfare
program
that
texas
has
had
been
authorized
by
amendments
to
the
constitution
which
allows
these
grants
to
be
made
to
needy
individual.
these
amendments
have
all
ways
which
authorized
these
grants
have
always
put
a
limit
upon
how
much
money
that
legislature
of
texas
been
appropriate
to
pay
these
grants
and
packed
up
until
1965.
they
even
put
a
limit
on
how
much
they
could
appropriate
for
various
wants
of
the
program.
however,
in
1965
this
was
gone
away
with
before
the
legislature
could
appropriate
different
varying
sums,
as
they
solved
it,
between
the
various
categories
were
in
operation.
mr.
pat
bailey
yes,
sir.
at
the
time
this
suit
began
it
was
$60
million
during
the
course
of
the
litigation
and
in
fact,
shortly
after
the
initial
judgment
was
entered,
the
people
of
the
state
raised
its
ceiling
to
$80
million.
the
bulk
of
which
went
to
the
afdc
program.
mr.
pat
bailey
yes
sir.
now,
--
mr.
pat
bailey
no
sir,
it’s
an
actual
figure.
it
has
been
gradually
going
up
somewhat
stop
the
time,
i
believe
the
last
attempt
before
the
one
it
was
passed
was
defeated.
so,
at
least
if
not
always
passed
the
vote
of
people.
mr.
pat
bailey
its
own
general
election
[voice
overlap]
the
legislature’s
constitutional
amendments
to
the
people
and
they
vote
on
them
either
passing
them
or
reject
it.
mr.
pat
bailey
yes,
sir.
now,
the
legislature
in
texas
meets
only
ever
two
years
except
on
special
session
and
normally
the
money
is
appropriated
on
a
two-year
basis
or
two-year
period.
now,
the
constitutional
amendments
can
only
be
submitted
pursuant
to
a
regular
session
which
means
if
we
get
in
a
process
financial
wise
we
can’t
call
a
special
session
and
submit
a
constitutional
amendment
and
get
more
money.
we’re
on
sort
of
a
two-year
basis.
now,
texas
in
the
late
60’s
and
starting
really
about
1968
like
many
other
states
had
various
regulations
dealing
with
add-ons
like
a
man-in-the-house,
maximum
grants,
and
certain
rest
of
performance.
the
court
decisions
that
began
to
come
about
in
this
period
of
time
resulted
in
a
dramatic
increase
in
welfare
rolls
but
mainly
in
afdc,
the
category
that
this
litigation
is
directed
at.
now,
the
result
or
consequence
of
this
was
that
we
had
it
constitutionally
fixed
the
amount
of
money
to
spend.
we
had
two-year
appropriation
to
work
with.
there
was
no
way
to
rapidly
it
meant
the
state
constitution
or
any
assurance
it’s
a
voters
would
to
make
more
money
available.
there
was
no
way
or
there
is
no
way
to
transfer
appropriations
between
these
categories
unless
the
legislature
does
it.
the
only
thing
that
could
happen
was
it
grants
and
some
of
the
categories
have
to
be
lowered,
the
ones
that
arose
or
raising
it
rapidly
in.
we
have
the
added
problem
that
this
time
is
it
the
cost
of
living
increase
required
by
the
social
security
act
became
effective
july
1,
1969.
texas
faced
with
its
problem
went
to
the
solution
at
some
states
were
using
in
one
that
the
department
of
hew
was
authorizing
that
up
going
to
a
ratable
reduction
method
where
we
recognized
this
standard
of
living
inquiries
but
we
can
only
pay
a
percentage
of
this.
texas
had
to
reduce
some
of
the
grants
as
a
result
of
using
this
rightful
reduction
system
and
it
was
because
of
this
the
either
reduction
of
some
of
the
individual’s
grants
or
the
fact
that
they
did
not
increase
that
actually
triggered
this
lawsuit.
now,
let’s
initially
look
at
the
constitutional
claim.
they
are
complaining
that
the
allocation
of
the
legislature
of
texas
that
made
between
this
various
categories
of
assistance
is
in
violation
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it’s
really
a
two-fold
crust,
i
think
in
here.
one
is
that,
we
are
not
saying
the
same
percentage
of
need
between
the
various
categories
and
they
say
there
should
be
no
various.
now,
in
the
aged
program,
we
paid
a
100%
as
to
the
blind
and
disabled
95%.
at
the
time
of
this
lawsuit,
50%
in
afdc.
this
is
about
--
mr.
pat
bailey
the
welfare
department,
your
honor,
on
the
basis
that
they
have
to
figure
how
much
money
they
had
and
how
much
they
were
going
to
pay
at?
mr.
pat
bailey
yes,
sir.
mr.
pat
bailey
the
legislature
did
this
and
the
welfare
department
of
course
then
has
to
take
the
money
that’s
in
the
program
and
say,
we’ve
got
so
many
people,
24
months
--
mr.
pat
bailey
within
the
budget,
yes,
your
honor.
now,
this
because
of
the
constitutional
amendment,
it
was
pass
raising
the
60
million
and
80
million.
we
have
since
been
able
to
increase
the
percentages
from
50%
to
75%
prior
to
time
and
will
shortly
after
this
suit
commenced.
mr.
pat
bailey
no,
sir.
they
stated
the
blind
and
disabled
were
stayed
at
95%
and
the
old
age
assistance
remained
at
100%.
mr.
pat
bailey
the
appellants
have
also
raised
the
allegation
that
this
allocation
found
between
the
category
has
some
form
of
racial
motivation
or
effect.
now,
as
to
the
contentions,
the
court
below
has
twice
rejected
it.
i
think
that
as
to
this
initial
argument
that
king
v.
smith
and
dandridge
v.
william
have
already
decided
this
initial
issue
adversely
to
the
appellants.
the
court
is
recognized
in
these
cases
that
the
state
have
considerable
latitude
in
allocating
their
afdc
resources.
i
think
this
court
has
said
that
each
state
is
free
to
set
its
own
standard
of
need
and
to
determine
the
level
of
benefits
by
the
amount
affirms
it
devotes
to
the
program.
i
don’t
believe
that
the
court
could
make
it
much
clear
that
the
states
can
use
their
discretion
as
to
what
particular
problem
in
the
welfare
area
that
the
state
wants
to
concentrate
upon
and
use
their
limited
funds
to
do
the
best
job
they
can.
i
think
the
court
below
recognized
this
when
they
saw
that
texas
only
had
a
limited
amount
of
money
and
they
felt
that
it
was
the
duty
of
the
legislature
of
the
state
to
use
its
judgment
in
the
manner
in
the
amount
the
available
money
should
be
divided.
i
think
that
the
court
below
possibly
look
to
this
court’s
warning
in
dandridge
v.
williams
where
the
court
stated
that
the
constitution
does
not
empower
the
court
to
second
guess
state
officials
charged
with
the
difficult
responsibility
of
allocating
limited
public
welfare
funds
among
the
merit
of
potential
recipients.
we
feel
that
to
do
otherwise
really
would
put
the
court
down
in
the
position
of
exercising
a
legislative
rather
than
a
judicial
function.
now,
i
think
that
without
commenting
at
length
upon
them,
there
are
numerous
reasons
which
are
constitutionally
sufficient
for
spending
less
in
one
program
unless
you
just
look
at
the
afdc
program
as
opposed
to
other
programs.
the
courts
have
long
recognized
that
these
are
different
programs
with
different
objectives.
secondly,
the
aged,
the
blind
and
the
disabled
are
not
luckily
going
to
improve
their
condition,
in
many
cases,
will
only
worsen.
these
people
are
also
quite
frequently
the
recipients
of
larger
amounts
of
drugs
or
medical
needs.
i
think
that
this
is
one
that
the
legislature
could
have
considered
as
wanting
to
devote
more
of
their
energy,
more
of
the
available
funds
in
this
area
as
opposed
to
another
and
not
necessarily
feeling
that
the
child
or
the
blind
or
someone
else
should
suffer
but
realizing
that
they
couldn’t
create
a
utopia
either
with
the
money
that
they
had.
mr.
pat
bailey
about
$23
million,
a
little
over
$23
million.
so
it
would
be
a
somewhere
around
close
to
30%
in
our
record
--
mr.
pat
bailey
out
of
the
$80
million,
i
believe
in
the
last
appropriation.
mr.
pat
bailey
i
would
have
to
look
your
honor.
i
believe
there
is
around
$50
million
goes
to
the
old
age
assistance
program.
the
blind
program
is
rather
small
--
mr.
pat
bailey
yes,
sir
and
in
aptd
is
also
risen
some
but
not
too
much
although
this
is
rapidly
growing
one.
but
the
remainder
of
the
money
about
the
$7
million
about
approximately
remaining
is
divided
between
the
blind
and
the
disabled.
mr.
pat
bailey
yes,
sir.
mr.
pat
bailey
i
think
it’s
probably
correct,
i
have
--
mr.
pat
bailey
now,
the
--
mr.
pat
bailey
yes,
sir.
mr.
pat
bailey
yes,
sir.
mr.
pat
bailey
this
is
correct
sir
either
one
is
a
correct.
now,
the
appellants
in
this
case
have
also
questioned
the
use
of
the
traditionally
equal
protection
test
by
the
court
below
rather
than
a
compelling
interest
test.
i
think
that
dandridge
v.
williams
decides
the
question
that
unless
there
are
some
showing
or
in
the
rule
of
a
regulation
and
there’s
a
racial
motivation
or
fact
that
the
compelling
interest
statute
should
not
come
in
to
play
unless
this
is
shown.
this
i
think
brings
us
both
to
this
question
into
the
civil
rights
question.
the
appellants
have
contended
that
this
allocation
is
because
of
some
racial
intent.
i
think
the
undisputed
facts
in
the
record
before
this
court
show
that
this
allegation
is
with
out
merit
in
the
court
below
has
on
two
in
occasions
so
held.
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
it
a
little
bit
of
the
facts
since
here.
they’ve
never
been
a
reduction
in
afdc
(inaudible).
the
amount
of
increase
is
over
the
last
28
years
have
almost
been
equal
from
the
standpoint
of
every
time
some
of
the
adult
categories
were
raised
in
money,
so
with
the
afdc
program.
mr.
pat
bailey
yes
sir,
in
total.
mr.
pat
bailey
the
afdc?
mr.
pat
bailey
yes,
your
honor,
there
have
been
over
the
history
of
these
programs
reductions
and
practically
every
one
of
them
at
one
time
or
another
either
by
the
legislature
not
appropriating
money
and
the
programs
growing
there
have
to
be
some
reductions
from
time
to
time
but
never
in
the
total
amount
of
money
spent
for
the
programs.
mr.
pat
bailey
since
1943,
the
afdc
program
has
been
growing
about
twice
as
fast
as
the
adult
programs.
the
majority
of
the
families
receiving
actually
an
increase
under
this
ratable
reduction
theory
that
texas
went
to
in
69
were
actually
large
families
which
were
predominantly
they
grow
in
mexican-american.
under
this
proposed
amendment
which
passed
increase
the
money
available
sum
$20
million
of
the
amount
that
was
appropriated
by
the
legislature.
the
afdc
got
almost
$12
million
out
of
the
$15
million
available.
also,
the
court
looking
at
the
depositions
of
the
welfare
department
officials
said
that
these
people
didn’t
even
know
what
the
racial
make
ups
of
the
various
category
was
until
after
this
suit
commenced
and
they
were
required
to
do
certain
studies
and
come
up
with
certain
statistics.
another
thing
that
we
get
in
to
here
if
we
talk
about
leveling
this
out,
if
we
took
and
these
are
stipulations
in
this
case,
if
we
took
this
money
and
leveled
it
out,
it
would
not
have
a
racial
effect
as
the
appellants
seem
to
contend.
it
would
mean
that
practically
and
equal
amount
of
racial
groups
in
the
adult
program,
the
aged,
the
blind,
and
the
disabled
would
have
their
grants
lowered
to
in
turn
it
raised
about
the
same
amount
of
individuals
in
this
ethnic
groups
in
the
afdc
program.
now,
if
this
was
not
the
case,
they
might
be
some
merit
to
appellant’s
contention
but
leveling
this
out
has
no
racial
connotation
because
they’re
going
to
be
as
many
people
in
the
mexican-american
and
the
negroes
that
will
have
their
grants
lower
than
this
other
programs
as
well
have
them
raised
in
afdc
and
i
think
this
itself
shows
the
lack
of
merit
in
appellants’
contention.
mr.
pat
bailey
i
have
and
not
a
word
in
the
record
nor
i
have
really
looked
to
see
what
the
percentage
difference
it
would
be
but
when
we’re
talking
about
people.
you’re
having
about
as
many
heart
as
you’re
having
held
among
the
latitudes.
i
think
that
king
and
dandridge
show
us
that
the
states
have
a
lot
of
latitude
in
the
way
they
allocate
this
money.
we
submit
also
that
there
was
no
racial
motivation
or
effect
in
what
has
been
done
in
the
allocation.
there
are
some
four
other
cases
the
lampton
out
of
louisiana,
the
ward
case
in
mississippi,
the
goodwin
case
out
of
new
york,
the
stanley
case
out
of
virginia
which
all
got
percentages
about
the
sign
are
very
strikingly
similar.
and
to
date,
i
am
not
aware
of
the
court
saying
that
this
show
racial
effect
or
motivation.
now,
as
to
the
statutory
question,
the
initial
attack
in
this
case
was
at
the
ratable
reduction
of
paying
only
a
percentage
of
this
recognize
need
was
paid.
however,
before
this
case
rates
this
court,
the
issue
was
resolved
by
rosado.
now,
there
was
no
pleadings
or
proof
or
allegations
in
the
trial
on
the
first
appeal
about
anything
that
texas
was
doing
wrong
in
its
method
of
determining
eligibility.
it
was
only
after
the
court,
this
court
sent
the
case
back
for
the
entry
of
a
new
judgment
and
after
the
court
had
entered
the
judgment
denying
both
the
constitutional
and
statutory
relives
of
by
the
appellants
that
they
raised
for
the
first
time
this
question
of
whether
or
not
texas
was
properly
determining
eligibility.
there
were
no
amended
pleadings
efforts
to
amend
their
pleadings.
none
of
the
appellants
before
this
court
were
affected
by
the
way
eligibility
was
determined.
the
only
party
which
could’ve
been
affected
was
the
party
davilla
but
she
didn’t
even
appeal
from
the
first
judgment
entered
by
the
court
and
was
no
longer
a
party
to
the
case
when
it
was
sent
back
for
the
entry
for
a
new
judgment
or
when
this
issue
as
to
determining
eligibility
was
first
raised
in
a
motion
to
amend
the
judgment
entered
by
the
court.
mr.
pat
bailey
well,
your
honor
we
feel
that
none
of
these
people
in
this
case.
mr.
pat
bailey
all
that
i
can
understand
by
what
they
have
said
here
your
honor,
is
that
the
possibility
that
some
day
in
the
future
this
person
might
become
ineligible.
this
shows
no
controversy.
the
only
thing
that
i
believe
counsel
said
is
that
if
the
court
could
let
this
issue
get
in
here,
this
person
might
have
a
--
mr.
pat
bailey
none
of
these
particular
appellants,
your
honor
are
ineligible
for
any
of
the
medical
assistance
programs
in
texas.
and
this
is
the
issue
that
we
raise
here
is
that
we
feel
that
none
of
these
people
have
been
in
anyway
affected.
mr.
pat
bailey
none
of
the
class
your
honor
that
they
represent
has
been
affected
and
i
think
that
counsel
and
the
appellants
are
in
most
unusual
position
here.
they
are
arguing
for
a
position
which
if
granted
by
this
court
will
actually
lower
their
benefits.
now,
this
is
a
most
strange
position
i
think
for
the
appellants
to
be
in
because
if
a
great
many
more
people
were
put
only
welfare
rolls
in
texas,
these
particular
appellants
would
have
to
have
their
benefits
reduced
and
i
think
this
is
a
somewhat
unique
situation
for
the
appellants
to
come
in
the
court
arguing.
mr.
pat
bailey
yes
sir,
afdc
will
result
in
the
--
mr.
pat
bailey
their
dollar
amounts
would
have
to
go
down
because
if
we
have
more
people
on
the
rose,
we’re
going
to
have
the
same
amount
of
money
is
going
to
have
to
go
further,
so
everyone
that’s
an
appellant
before
this
case.
it
would
have
their
grants.
mr.
pat
bailey
this
might
be
true
your
honor
but
i
think
we
came
back
again
of
the
fact
if
there’s
really
no
controversy
as
to
this
issue
between
the
parties
before
this
court.
what
they’re
really
doing
is
this.
they’ve
lost
–-
the
rosado
caused
them
to
lose
their
statutory
issue
on
this
ratable
reduction
and
the
only
thing
they
got
left
now,
that
they
try
to
jump
in
at
the
lightest
as
many
here,
is
the
fact
that
this
--
the
way
we’re
determining
eligibility,
that
something
that
would
never
in
the
case
until
the
second
judgment
was
entered.
they
got
an
issue
--
mr.
pat
bailey
yes
sir,
what
they’re
saying
in
here
is
that
what
texas
does?
they
apply
this
ratable
reduction
factor
to
the
standard
of
need.
let’s
just
say
it
is
$75.00
and
there’s
a
$100.00
worth
of
need.
it
would
be
$75.00
for
a
particular
individual.
if
they
have
income
of
more
than
$75.00
then
they
are
ineligible.
what
the
appellants
would
like
to
have
happen
here
would
be
for
their
eligibility
to
be
determined
on
the
four
recognized
need.
this
would
in
turn
put
them
showing
a
small
amount
of
unmet
need.
this
would
then
put
them
in
the
welfare
rolls
at
a
small
grant
opening
up
some
certain
benefits.
mr.
pat
bailey
yes,
your
honor.
now,
i
think
that
one
of
the
problems
that
we
run
into
here
when
did
this
is
that
we
are
letting
or
putting
on
the
welfare
rolls
certain
people
who
are
very
marginally
eligible
to
get
certain
benefits.
but
the
result
is,
is
that
we’re
having
to
penalize
the
people
who
need
the
help
the
most
because
it’s
the
people
that
have
no
outside
income
who
have
larger
in
needs
that
are
going
ultimately
have
to
have
their
grant
reduced
to
put
this
marginally
needy
people
on
the
rolls.
now,
i
did
not
think
that
it
was
the
intent
of
congress
in
this
act
to
penalize
the
most
needy.
mr.
pat
bailey
i
don’t
see
how,
your
honor
because
he
is
receiving
a
welfare
grant
and
he
is
receiving
medical
benefits.
now,
if
he
was
not,
if
he
had
been
terminated
and
no
longer
could
get
a
grant,
could
no
longer
get
the
medical
assistance,
then
i
think
your
honor
they
would
have
a
proper
party
before
this
court
but
they
don’t
have
one
yet.
they
wanted
to
change
horses
here
but
they
haven’t
got
anybody
who
will
fit
the
saddle
of
this
new
horse
that
they’ve
got.
i
think
that
really
that
they
have
tried
--
the
appellants
have
tried
to
read
in
to
this
portion
of
the
social
security
act,
that
portion
requiring
this
cost
of
living
adjustment.
a
whole
lot
more
than
congress
ever
intended
to
put
there.
the
court
in
rosado
recognized
that
the
purpose
of
this
was
to
make
the
states
recognized
that
cost
of
living
increases
had
occurred,
that
the
state
should
adjust
to
them,
that
in
turn
it
might
prove
the
states
to
spend
more
money
in
this
area.
but
i
think
that
really
what
they’re
asking
here
is
that
something
new
be
read
into
this
step
that
the
eligibility
requirements
be
change,
the
way
that
the
states
determine
eligibility
and
i
think
that
if
congress
have
intended
this
to
be
the
purpose,
they
would
have
written
in
the
end
a
whole
lot
clearer
than
this
and
not
let
to
adopt
a
hope
that
some
litigant
might
discover
this
hidden
among
this
statute
that
this
was
the
purpose
of
it.
i
think
that
in
conclusion
that
the
question
of
whether
to
help
the
more
at
a
cost
of
the
many
really,
and
this
is
the
argument
that
they’re
making
in
this
case,
is
the
business
of
the
legislative
branch
not
the
judicial.
i
think
that
the
arguments
and
hopes
of
the
appellants
in
this
case
are
ones
that
should
be
pursued
in
the
legislative
and
congressional
halls
rather
than
in
the
courts.
i
think
that
really
what
they
would
like
to
do
is
when
you
strip
all
the
argument
in
the
rhetoric
and
the
clichés
that
are
used
is
that
they
would
really
like
this
court
to
judge
the
wisdom
and
the
propriety
of
the
way
the
legislature
of
texas
has
decided
it
would
spend
the
money
had
available
in
the
welfare
area
and
turn
these
appellants
this
satisfaction
with
this
plan
and
possibly,
if
they
can
get
the
court
to
agree
with
them
in
to
some
form
of
constitutional
or
statutory
prohibition.
i
think
that
the
path
of
this
court
is
clear
and
that
is
to
sustain
the
judgment
of
the
court
below.
thank
you.
