mr.
steven
j.
cole
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
burger
and
may
it
please
the
court.
with
the
court’s
permission
i
would
like
to
save
five
minutes
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
the
state
of
texas
provides
public
assistance
to
four
groups
of
its
needy
residence
and
receives
over
350
million
dollars
a
year
from
united
states
for
this
purpose.
the
four
groups
are
the
children
deprived
of
parental
care
and
support
because
of
the
absence,
death,
or
incapacity
of
the
parent.
persons
over
age
65,
the
disabled
and
the
blind,
these
are
the
persons
both
congress
and
the
state
of
texas
have
identified
as
needing
financial
assistance
because
they
do
not
have
a
breadwinner
in
the
household.
texas
has
established
the
welfare
program
covering
all
four
groups
in
its
public
welfare
act
of
1941
pursuant
to
a
single
provision
of
the
texas
constitution.
there
are
two
separate
issues
presented
by
this
appeal.
the
first
is
whether
the
equal
protection
clause
and
title
vi
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act
permits
texas
to
pay
afdc
recipients
eight-ninths
of
whom
are
black
and
mexican-american,
50%
of
the
amount
texas
has
determined
to
be
their
minimum
required
needs
while
it
pays
all
other
welfare
recipients,
those
receiving
aid
under
the
old
age,
aid
to
the
blind
and
aid
to
the
disabled
programs,
three-fifths
of
whom
are
white
95%
or
a
100%
of
the
same
minimum
needs.
the
statutory
issue
presented
today
is
whether
texas
may
consistent
with
the
social
security
act
as
construed
by
this
court
in
rosado
versus
wyman
determine
eligibility
for
afdc
and
the
amount
of
afdc
payments
by
subtracting
outside
income
from
50%
of
the
standard
of
need
rather
than
from
the
standard
of
need
itself.
both
issues
must
be
decided
by
the
court
since
a
victory
on
either
one
to
the
appellants
will
still
leave
the
other
in
dispute.
the
starting
point
for
understanding
both
issues
is
the
standard
of
need.
this
has
been
referred
to
by
the
court
in
rosado
with
the
yardstick
to
determining
who
is
eligible
for
public
assistance.
the
standard
is
a
dollar
amount
which
represents
the
state’s
judgment
as
to
what
is
necessary
to
provide
a
subsistence
level
living
in
that
particular
state.
in
texas,
the
items
included
in
the
standard
or
personal
needs
which
include
food,
clothing,
and
personal
incidentals
shelter
cause
and
a
few
special
need
items.
texas
uses
a
single
standard
for
all
welfare
recipients
in
the
state
regardless
of
the
category
under
which
the
recipient
receives
as
assistance.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
no,
that’s
not
exactly
right,
your
honor.
what
happens
is
texas
has
a
standard
budgetary
allowance.
so
for
example
shelter
needs
are
budgeted
according
to
the
household
size
and
not
according
to
the
category.
similarly,
personal
needs
are
budgeted
according
to
age.
adults
in
the
adc
program,
the
caretaker,
the
mother
caring
for
children
receive
the
same
budget
and
needs
not
receive
but
are
budgeted
for
the
same
needs
as
adults
in
the
aid
to
the
blind
program
or
old
age
assistance
program.
children,
the
dependents
of
an
old
age
recipient
or
dependents
of
an
adc
mother
are
budgeted
for
the
same
amount
in
each
program.
texas
has
made
a
judgment
and
we
do
not
challenge
it
in
this
case.
the
children
require
less
per
month
than
an
adult
to
supply
the
same
minimum
needs.
but
we
have
not
challenged
that
in
this
lawsuit.
an
example
of
how
this
work
is
at
page
41
and
42
of
our
brief
that
might
be
helpful
if
i
refer
to
that.
in
table
one,
we
have
set
forth
an
age
couple
both
receiving
old
age
assistance,
that’s
at
page
41,
and
the
state
has
determined
that
for
each
month
that
couple
needs
a
$172.00
per
month
for
a
personal
and
shelter
needs.
on
page
42
at
table
two,
is
a
mother
and
three
children
who
received
afdc
from
the
state
of
texas.
their
monthly
needs
have
been
defined
by
the
state
of
texas
now
to
be
$182.00
a
month
or
just
slightly
more
than
the
two-person
family
receiving
oaa.
now,
these
amounts
for
both
families
are
approximately
$2,100.00
a
year
and
ask
the
court
to
bear
in
mind
that
this
standard
is
far
from
generous.
the
united
states
defined
the
official
poverty
levels
about
$3,900.00
a
year
for
a
family
or
poor
and
the
bureau
of
labor
statistics,
level
of
living
budget
is
over
$6,500.00
a
year.
in
any
case,
we
are
not
challenging
in
this
lawsuit,
the
fact
that
texas
defines
the
needs
of
a
family
of
four
with
three
children
to
be
only
slightly
greater
than
the
needs
of
the
family
of
two.
we
accept
that
judgment.
texas
has
made
it.
we
are
not
questioning
it.
we
also
are
not
questioning
the
fact
that
that
standard
for
both
of
those
families
is
defined
so
inadequately.
that’s
not
an
issue
in
this
lawsuit.
we
again
accept
that
judgment.
our
position
is
that
having
determined
the
subsistence
needs
of
both
families.
texas
may
not
discriminate
in
the
percentage
of
those
needs
that
chooses
to
meet
for
the
various
groups
of
recipients.
in
practical
term,
what
has
happened
is
that
texas
has
called
the
family
in
table
one
that
since
they
are
needy
and
since
they
are
dependent
because
they
are
old,
the
state
will
guarantee
them
whatever
they
need
to
purchase
a
subsistence
diet
and
adequate
shelter
according
to
texas’
judgment
in
any
case.
while
at
the
same
time,
the
state
has
hold
the
children
in
table
two
that
since
they
are
equal
need
and
their
dependence
is
cause
by
the
death
or
absence
or
incapacity
of
their
father.
the
state
will
only
have
them
purchase
50%
of
what
the
state
says
they
need
to
survive.
at
the
outset,
we
wish
to
make
clear
for
the
court
that
the
discrimination
in
the
percent
of
needs
pay
is
not
related
to
any
differences
in
the
requirements
of
the
various
recipients.
as
we
have
mentioned,
the
percentage
reduction
is
applied
after
the
standard
of
need
is
a
computed.
therefore
if
there
are
any
differences
in
need
in
these
particular
families
for
instance,
economies
of
scale
because
there
a
lot
more
members
of
the
household,
or
maybe
a
blind
recipient
needs
to
seeing
live
again
and
of
course
an
afdc
family
normally
would
not.
those
will
be
reflected
in
the
standard
of
need
before
the
percentages
are
thought.
we’re
dealing
with
families
that
texas
has
said
after
it
computes
the
standard
or
equally
needy.
as
the
department
of
health
education
and
welfare
pointed
out
a
brief
in
the
district
court
of
alabama
which
i
submitted
to
this
court
in
whitfield
versus
king.
the
percentage
reduction
as
applied
is
essentially
a
physical
measure.
it
is
unrelated
to
the
needs
of
the
various
recipients.
we
also
ask
the
court
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
percentage
reduction
in
this
case
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
availability
or
none
availability
of
other
sources
of
income.
when
income
is
actually
available
to
a
particular
recipient
whether
it
be
an
oaa
recipient
or
an
afdc
recipient,
for
example,
child
support
to
the
adc
mother,
social
security
benefits
for
the
oaa
family,
that
income
is
subtracted
from
the
grant.
there
aren’t
any
double
benefits
we
are
contending
with
here.
so
the
percentage
reduction
has
nothing
to
do
with
that.
in
fact,
the
way
texas
applies
to
percentage
reduction
to
do
the
afdc
family
actually
operates
as
a
work
disincentive.
unlike
no
in
the
dandridge
versus
williams
case
involving
family
maximums
that
this
court
decided.
texas
does
not
encourage
an
afdc
recipient
to
seek
nonwelfare
sources
of
income.
since
it’s
impossible
for
the
texas
afdc
family
to
use
that
income
to
get
closer
and
closer
to
the
standard
of
need
because
the
way
texas
applies
the
percentage
reduction
is
it
applies
it
for
the
standard
first
and
then
it
subtracts
outside
income.
no
afdc
family
in
texas
could
ever
end
up
with
more
than
50%
of
its
needs.
so
it
has,
it
does
not
have
that
work
incentive
feature
the
maryland
family
maximum
and
indeed
the
supreme
court
of
california
unanimously
decided
in
case
villa
versus
hall
which
we’ve
also
supplied
to
this
court.
the
court
noted
that
this
too
was
a
work
disincentive
feature
and
specifically
referred
to
the
texas
budgetary
method
which
is
similar
to
california.
it
is
this
aspect
that
the
percentage
reduction
is
used
by
texas
which
gives
rise
to
a
social
security
act
claim.
and
with
the
court’s
indulgence,
i’d
like
to
finish
the
statement
of
the
case
with
the
facts
they
gave
rise
to
a
statutory
claim
and
then
returned
to
the
argument.
prior
to
may
1969,
the
family
described
in
table
two
receiving
afdc
was
determined
by
texas
to
need
approximately
$165.00
per
month
under
the
texas
standard
of
need.
since
at
that
time,
texas
used
that
standard
to
determine
the
amount
of
payment
and
eligibility
for
payments
or
all
person
families
with
income
less
than
this
amount
receive
some
benefits.
the
precise
amount
depends
on
whether
or
not
there
are
budget
deficits.
the
standard
of
need
minus
their
available
income
exceeded
the
maximum
grant
level
then
in
effect
in
texas.
if
it
did,
they
only
receive
the
maximum.
effective
may
1,
1969,
consistent
with
one
of
the
mandates
of
section
402
(a)
23
which
is
the
subject
of
the
court
in
rosado
decision,
texas
adjusted
its
standard
of
need
by
11%.
the
cost
of
living
increased
since
that
standard
was
last
priced
in
1965.
we
are
not
challenging
the
adequacy
of
that
adjustment
in
this
case.
as
a
result,
the
family
in
table
two
now
is
determined
by
texas
to
need
$17.00
per
month
more
or
now
$182.00
per
month.
additional
families
therefore,
those
with
income
below
this
new
standard
of
a
$182.00
but
above
the
pre
may
1969
standard
of
a
$165.00
have
now
been
determined
by
the
state
of
texas
to
be
in
need
of
public
assistance.
but
on
that
day,
texas
stopped
using
its
standard
of
need
as
the
afdc
yardstick
against
which
income
would
be
compared
and
that
--
mr.
steven
j.
cole
no,
i
am
not
your
honor.
the
family
before
may
1969
received
when
they
changed
the
new
policy
and
adjust
the
standard
received
the
full
difference
between
the
standard
of
need
and
their
available
income
limited
--
mr.
steven
j.
cole
they
got
$65.
right!
the
only
limitation
was
there
was
a
family
maximum
on
grants
which
in
texas
at
that
time
was
a
$123.00.
so
if
there
budget
deficit
was
greater
than
$123.00,
they
only
receive
the
$123.00.
that
was
the
system
that
was
upheld
in
dandridge
versus
williams.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
okay.
now,
the
standard
has
been
raised.
the
standard
now
is
$182.00.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
but
at
time
the
suit
was
brought
the
percentage
factor
was
50%,
so
let’s
use
that
figure.
the
50%
is
multiplied
against
the
$182.00
which
results
it
in
an
item
which
texas
called
recognizable
needs
even
though
the
standard
of
need
is
a
$182.00
and
that
recognizable
need
is
$91.00.
the
family
with
income
of
$100.00
now,
receives
no
benefits.
not
only
does
it
receive
no
benefits
but
the
family
since
it’s
not
receiving
a
cash
welfare
grant
loses
complete
medicaid
coverage.
there
was
medicaid
in
the
state
of
texas
and
in
half
the
states
is
condition
on
the
receipt
of
public
assistance.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
it
was
made
may
1,
1969
and
it
was
the
policy
that’s
now
being
challenged
by
amended
complaint
in
this
lawsuit.
by
the
way,
the
medicaid
consequences
which
i
refer
to
are
not
minimum.
the
solicitor
general
has
told
the
court
that
for
the
average
of
afdc
family
it
amounts
to
about
$50.00
to
$60.00
per
month.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
congress
has
mandated
in
title
19
of
the
social
security
act
that
medicaid
assistance
be
provided
only
to
those
persons
receiving
aid
under
one
of
the
cash
welfare
programs.
since
that
person
is
now
still
needy,
they’re
not
receiving
a
dollar
grant
and
they
lose
medicaid
eligibility.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
that’s
right.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
that’s
exactly
right.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
yes.
your
honor,
we
are
not
maintaining
in
this
lawsuit
that
texas
must
pay
full
needs.
i’d
like
to
make
that
clear.
texas
could
establish
any
presented
reduction
it
wishes
under
the
rosado
decision
as
long
as
it
pays
some
benefits
to
those
families
with
a
need.
that
is
if
it
wants
to
pay
only
10%
of
benefits
but
it
applies
that
to
the
budget
deficit
after
it
subtracts
the
income
then
the
medicaid
consequences
would
not
attach
because
the
family
will
get
some
dollar
benefits.
what
happen
in
texas
beginning
may
1969
is
that
2500
family
who
were
previous
families
who
were
previously
receiving
afdc
became
ineligible
by
the
operation
of
the
new
system
that
was
stipulated
by
the
state
and
of
course
the
new
families
who
were
rendered
needy
by
the
adjustment
to
the
standard
of
need,
those
marginal
income
families
were
kept
off
the
rolls.
it
is
this
that
gives
rise
to
a
statutory
claim
since
texas
managed
to
cancel
out
the
one
practical
effect.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
yes,
sir.
absolutely
or
at
least
only
earn
90
if
they
could
manage
that
or
only
receive
90.
there
are
other
factors
other
than
work.
the
father
is
deciding
whether
they
support
their
families.
every
dollar
of
support
goes
to
the
state
treasury
as
opposed
to
helping
that
family
reach
the
standard
of
need.
and
let’s
remember
the
standard
of
need
is
what
texas
defines
as
that
basic
requirement
to
subsistence
living.
so
families
below
that
standard
--
mr.
steven
j.
cole
the
solicitor
general
has
told
the
court
that
the
average
afdc
family
receives
$50.00
to
$60.00
a
month
medicaid.
i
don’t
think
i
have
to
belabor
the
point
that
medical
care
could
mean
like
itself
and
if
we
are
dealing
after
all
what
families
who
don’t
even
have
enough
to
supply
under
texas’
own
terms
enough
food,
clothing
and
shelter
to
their
families.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
first
of
all,
this
is
a
class
action
and
there’s
stipulation,
there
are
2500
families
in
texas
eligibility
was
effective
by
this,
that’s
number
one
and
mrs.
davilla
was
a
plaintiff
in
a
consolidated
case.
the
reason
she
did
not
appeal
is
not
available
to
me.
i
don’t
know
the
reasons.
it’s
perhaps
because
the
jefferson
point
this
appeal
and
she
thought
she
was
protected
but
more
important
than
that,
one
of
the
appellants
that
is
before
the
court
mr.
vasquez
is
presently
earning
income.
he
was
not
when
the
complaint
was
filed.
he
is
now
receiving
some
disability
benefits.
now,
but
they
weren’t
enough
to
defeat
his
eligibility.
the
manner
of
computing
the
payment
affects
him
seriously
because
if
the
percentage
were
applied
after
his
income
is
subtracted,
he
would
receive
the
much
higher
grant.
it’s
our
contention
that
mr.
vasquez
even
if
you
don’t
want
to
consider
the
unnamed
members
of
the
class
who
were
not
before
the
court
now
that
mr.
vasquez
has
an
interest
in
the
computation
method
and
he
is
raising
the
eligibility
consequences
since
if
the
court
agrees
with
this
on
that
point,
we’ll
have
to
strike
the
texas
method
and
he
will
get
an
increase
grant
as
a
result.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
yes,
sir.
i’d
like
to
conclude
on
this
factual
statement
by
pointing
out
that
this
effect
of
making
these
additional
needy
families
eligible
was
precisely
what
mr.
justice
harlan
referred
to
in
the
rosado
opinion
is
the
one
practical
effect
in
his
statute
under
which
we’re
litigating
to
make
this
largely
needy
families
eligible
for
the
care
and
training
provisions
of
the
act.
with
respect
to
our
equal
protection
claim,
our
position
is
that
the
district
court
incorrectly
measured
the
discrimination
against
afdc
recipients
according
to
the
traditionally
lenient
equal
protection
test.
frankly,
we
believe
that
the
treatment
of
afdc
recipient
has
a
racial
purpose
to
it.
in
light
of
the
enormous
racial
imbalance
in
the
various
welfare
categories,
the
law
of
history
of
restrictive
measures
against
afdc
recipient
in
texas
which
are
borne
most
heavily
on
blacks
in
the
program,
the
states
decision
to
allocate
funds
as
it
has
with
this
little
room
for
any
other
inference,
this
is
particularly
so
when
appellees
almost
frivolous
explanation
to
add
it
to
the
picture.
i’d
like
to
discuss
them
in
a
moment.
our
case
however,
does
not
depend
in
this
court’s
finding
a
racial
purpose
to
the
discrimination.
in
dandridge,
the
court
said
that
even
if
the
state
welfare
regulation
is
not
drawn
on
its
face
in
racial
terms
but
if
shown
to
have
a
racially
discriminatory
effect
it
will
be
inherently
suspect
and
subject
to
restrict
judicial
review
by
the
court.
this
is
just
such
a
case,
i
first
like
to
set
out
a
very
briefly
to
court
the
racial
impact
of
what
texas
has
done
and
then
review
the
explanations
put
forth
to
the
huge
disparities.
of
a
total
of
389,000
welfare
recipients
in
the
state,
46%
of
them
are
white,
54%
of
them
are
black
or
mexican-american.
in
comparison,
the
racial
and
ethnic
distribution
within
each
category
strike
an
afdc,
it’s
not
54%
black
or
mexican-american;
it’s
87%
black
and
mexican-american.
the
old
age
program
is
--
mr.
steven
j.
cole
i’ll
have
to
refer
to
the
record
your
honor.
our
record
at
page
--
mr.
steven
j.
cole
well,
i
have
a
right
here
at
page
72
of
the
record.
the
afdc
program
is
–
yes,
it’s
about
44.6%
black,
40%
mexican
of
the
85%
or
86%.
yes,
so
the
black
and
mexicans
are
evenly
divided,
yes,
sir.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
the
oaa
program
is
not
a
majority
black
or
mexican
as
we
might
have
expected
but
its
63%
white.
in
setting
its
payment
levels,
texas
has
selected
a
one
classification
that
enables
the
most
whites
to
be
benefited
by
the
states
allocation
while
at
the
same
time
the
greatest
number
of
blacks
and
mexicans
are
disadvantaged.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
yes
sir,
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
we
have
set
forth
two
trials.
one,
as
of
october
1970
which
was
the
latest
published
information
we
had
from
the
department
health,
education,
and
welfare,
we
list
about
20
states
that
have
a
percentage
of
disparity.
in
appendix
b,
we
have
selected
those
states
disparities
as
great
as
texas
was
25%
as
of
today.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
at
1
(b)
of
our
brief,
it’s
the
very
last
page
of
the
brief
and
if
you’ll
notice
those
seven
states
whose
percentage
disparity
as
great
as
texas
is,
five
of
those
states
present
a
racial
disparity
very
similar
to
texas.
with
this
racial
impact
in
mind,
we
asked
the
court
to
consider
texas’
justification
for
selecting
the
afdc
recipients
to
bear
the
sole
grant
of
the
state
physical
limitations.
we
think
their
justification
is
so
rational
that
the
court
to
decide
this
case
in
our
favor
using
the
traditional
test.
there
are
three
sets
of
explanations,
there’s
a
practical
one
in
the
record,
there’s
a
lawyer’s
justification
and
there’s
the
one
that
district
court
use.
the
practical
justification
is
this,
the
three-judge
court
below
asked
counsel
whether
there
was
anything
in
the
record
that
would
support
this
discrimination.
the
attorney
general’s
response
was
and
i
quote,
it’s
at
page
71
of
the
oral
argument.
“we’ve
got
just
so
much
money
in
each
of
this
program
to
spend.”
well,
this
is
undoubtedly
true.
but
what
we
are
challenging
here
is
the
legislature’s
allocation
of
the
money.
now,
that
takes
the
question
before
the
court.
now,
we
remind
the
court
that
since
1965,
the
texas
constitution
has
given
the
legislature
complete
flexibility
and
appropriations.
it
has
only
a
total
sealing.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
yes
sir
and
i
don’t
think
it
would
have
to
be
at
60%.
[voice
overlap]
the
reason
i
say
that
your
honor
is
because
there
are
twice
as
many
old
age
recipients
as
afdc
recipients.
so
very
--
but
yes,
sir.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
no,
unless
the
texas
constitution
was
amended,
it
would
not
be
a
100%
across
the
board
but
they
do
have
flexibility
before
65
they
didn’t.
the
texas
constitution
said
a
certain
limited
amount
for
adc
and
a
certain
limited
amount
for
old
age
assistance.
that
is
no
longer
the
case.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
no,
sir.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
if
the
texas
constitution
state
as
it
is,
that
would
be
the
result,
yes.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
no,
but
frankly
your
honor,
we
do
believe
and
this
is
not
a
legal
judgment
to
be
made
either
by
us
or
the
court
that
if
that
question
is
put
to
the
texas
people,
the
constitutional
sealing
will
be
raise.
but
it’s
true
that
if
we
win,
we’re
not
requiring
the
state
to
spend
more
money
and
it
would
be
a
reallocation.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
right,
the
stipulations
make
clear
that
texas
is
fully
spending
its
appropriation
on
the
other
categories
and
then
you
have
to
come
from
somewhere.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
we
do
not
know.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
your
honor,
my
position
would
be
that
they
stand
in
the
same
position
as
the
favorite
class
in
almost
every
equal
protection
case
that’s
before
the
court.
i
think
the
thing
that’s
troubling
you
is,
we’re
dealing
here
with
a
pot
of
money
not
eligibility
for
public
housing
or
a
regulation
of
business
but
it’s
always
true
that
the
favorite
class
stand
to
lose
its
favorite
treatment
if
the
disfavored
class
wins
the
lawsuit.
and
under
rule
19,
i
don’t
think
this
court
has
ever
required
that
disfavored
class
to
be
brought
before
the
court.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
i
suppose
that’s
right
to
the
extent
that
the
texas
constitution
limits
the
present
texas
constitution
limits
the
total
expenditure.
i
would
say
this,
your
honor,
that
the
suit
obviously
had
widespread
precedent
state
of
texas
was
well
known
in
the
state
of
texas
and
i
think
it
would
be
wrong
to
say
that
the
suit
would
come
as
a
surprise
if
the
appellants
before
this
court
should
win
and
will
become
a
surprise
to
the
old
age
recipients
in
the
state.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
your
honor,
that
is
really
one
of
the
points
that
goes
to
the
heart
of
why
texas
has
done
what
they’ve
done.
25%
of
all
the
people
over
65
in
the
state
texas
receive
old
age
assistance
that’s
an
astounding
figure.
the
appellees
have
testified
quite
candidly
that
it
was
their
political
clout
that
is
basically
encouraged
the
legislature
to
appropriate
as
it
has.
mr.
bond
(ph)
who
is
the
chairman
of
public
welfare
testified
that
oaa
touches
nearly
every
home.
afdc
doesn’t
touch
as
many
people
and
the
oaa
people
have
the
votes.
now,
i
would
think
the
legislatures
have
been
responsive
to
them
and
they
must
have
some
input
in
to
the
process.
i
point
that
that
the
afdc
children
represent
less
than
3%
of
the
state’s
population
of
children
under
18
compared
to
the
oaa
percentage.
i
really
have
no
other
response
to
the
fact
that
they
have
not
been
formally
brought
before
the
court.
i
will
point
that
the
state
of
texas
is
never
made
any
motions
to
bring
them
before
the
court
either
for
whatever
that’s
worth.
i’d
like
to
point
out
that
the
record
shows
that
the
welfare
officials
would
equalize
if
the
legislature
appropriated
at
a
lump
sum.
mr.
bond’s
deposition
again
indicated
that.
so,
there
is
no
welfare
related
reason
for
this.
the
welfare
expert
says,
if
you
give
me
a
lump
sum
that’s
what
i
would
do.
i’d
have
a
percentage
across
the
board
but
they
haven’t
given
him
a
lump
sum
even
though
the
constitution
permits
it.
the
lawyer’s
justification
was
that
the
discrimination
is
justified
because
afdc
children
and
mothers
well,
today
employable
are
more
likely
to
be
come
employable
in
the
future
and
also
because
they’re
more
likely
to
get
support
from
relatives.
well,
future
employability
potential
obviously
has
no
bearing
on
the
rationality
of
current
payment
disparities.
the
welfare
programs
are
designed
to
meet
current
needs
and
maybe
that
would
justify
in
the
running
training
programs
by
afdc
recipients
but
it
certainly
won’t
justify
current
afdc
grants.
and
surely,
texas
won’t
suggest
that
paying
50%
of
needs
in
oaa
would
be
fair
in
light
of
the
fact
that
a
majority
of
oaa
recipients
receives
social
security,
it
just
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
question
before
court.
the
district
court
viewed
the
program
as
completely
separate
programs.
whatever
you
do
in
oaa,
you
don’t
have
to
do
an
adc
because
they’re
separate
because
we
see
an
adc
the
purpose
is
to
strengthen
family
life
and
the
purpose
of
the
other
program
is
self-care.
the
fact
is
that
texas
constitution
and
the
texas
statutes
makes
no
such
distinction.
the
purposes
are
single-minded,
financial
aid
and
rehabilitative
services.
now,
i
would
suppose
that
a
blind
person
may
need
a
different
kind
of
social
service
that
an
adc
mother
who’s
husband
just
pasted
away
but
i
would
suggest
that
those
differences
don’t
justify
a
difference
in
the
financial
assistance
you
give
to
the
family.
with
respect
to
the
statutory
claim,
section
402
(a)
23
required
each
state
by
july
1969
to
adjust
the
amounts
used
in
that
state
to
determine
a
family’s
needs
for
afdc
and
also
to
proportionally
adjust
any
maximums
that
the
state
may
have.
before
this
court
rosado
vs.
wyman,
the
petitioners
argued
that
that
section
contemplate
an
increase
in
all
afdc
payments
by
july
1969.
they
urged
that
any
other
construction
would
it
render
the
statute
of
meaningless
bookkeeping
exercise.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
okay.
i’ll
finish
the
statutory
claim,
and
if
i
have
the
time
after
to
rebuttal,
thank
you.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
your
honor,
first
of
all,
i
would
like
to
remind
the
court
that
there
are
2500
families
that
texas
has
stipulated
as
eligibilities
been
terminated
as
a
result
of
the
method
used
here.
secondly,
mr.
vasquez
whose
eligibility
has
not
been
terminated
has
lost
approximately
$40.00
a
month
by
the
method
of
computation
which
streaked
him
because
of
its
eligibility
consequences
he
would
gain
$40.00
per
month.
in
recital,
the
court
said
at
page
413
that
402
(a)
23
has
the
effect
of
requiring
the
states
to
recognize
and
accept
the
responsibility
for
those
additional
individuals
whose
income
fall
short
of
the
standard
need
is
computed
in
light
of
economic
realities
and
to
place
them
amongst
those
eligible
for
the
care
and
training
provisions
of
the
act.
the
court
said
this
because
hew
came
to
the
court
and
told
the
court,
that’s
402
(a)
23
meant
and
if
you’ll
look
at
the
amicus
brief
for
this
solicitor
general
in
recital,
you
will
find
those
words.
the
solicitor
general
in
this
case
says
that
yes
the
court
said
it
but
that
was
dictum
and
he
didn’t
really
mean
to
say
it
and
i
think
if
the
court
looks
at
the
basis
for
the
decision
in
the
new
york
case
in
light
throughout
new
york’s
program,
you
will
realize
it
wasn’t
dictum
at
all.
thank
you.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
they
are
all
competing
interests
amongst
the
class
which
was
when
the
suit
was
brought
to
find
these
all
afdc
recipients
in
the
state.
the
original
contentions
in
the
suit
were
indeed
that
payments
had
to
increase
for
everybody.
that
was
rejected
in
recital.
of
course
when
payments
had
to
increase,
so
did
eligibility
that
flowed
with
it.
on
remand,
when
the
payments
increased
question
which
no
longer
a
viable
question
because
of
recital
there
was
diverging
claims
i
supposed
and
--
mr.
steven
j.
cole
your
honor,
i
can’t,
i
personally
can’t
respond
to
that
because
i
was
not
a
district
court
level
in
this
case.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
burger
and
may
it
please
the
court.
with
the
court’s
permission
i
would
like
to
save
five
minutes
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
the
state
of
texas
provides
public
assistance
to
four
groups
of
its
needy
residence
and
receives
over
350
million
dollars
a
year
from
united
states
for
this
purpose.
the
four
groups
are
the
children
deprived
of
parental
care
and
support
because
of
the
absence,
death,
or
incapacity
of
the
parent.
persons
over
age
65,
the
disabled
and
the
blind,
these
are
the
persons
both
congress
and
the
state
of
texas
have
identified
as
needing
financial
assistance
because
they
do
not
have
a
breadwinner
in
the
household.
texas
has
established
the
welfare
program
covering
all
four
groups
in
its
public
welfare
act
of
1941
pursuant
to
a
single
provision
of
the
texas
constitution.
there
are
two
separate
issues
presented
by
this
appeal.
the
first
is
whether
the
equal
protection
clause
and
title
vi
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act
permits
texas
to
pay
afdc
recipients
eight-ninths
of
whom
are
black
and
mexican-american,
50%
of
the
amount
texas
has
determined
to
be
their
minimum
required
needs
while
it
pays
all
other
welfare
recipients,
those
receiving
aid
under
the
old
age,
aid
to
the
blind
and
aid
to
the
disabled
programs,
three-fifths
of
whom
are
white
95%
or
a
100%
of
the
same
minimum
needs.
the
statutory
issue
presented
today
is
whether
texas
may
consistent
with
the
social
security
act
as
construed
by
this
court
in
rosado
versus
wyman
determine
eligibility
for
afdc
and
the
amount
of
afdc
payments
by
subtracting
outside
income
from
50%
of
the
standard
of
need
rather
than
from
the
standard
of
need
itself.
both
issues
must
be
decided
by
the
court
since
a
victory
on
either
one
to
the
appellants
will
still
leave
the
other
in
dispute.
the
starting
point
for
understanding
both
issues
is
the
standard
of
need.
this
has
been
referred
to
by
the
court
in
rosado
with
the
yardstick
to
determining
who
is
eligible
for
public
assistance.
the
standard
is
a
dollar
amount
which
represents
the
state’s
judgment
as
to
what
is
necessary
to
provide
a
subsistence
level
living
in
that
particular
state.
in
texas,
the
items
included
in
the
standard
or
personal
needs
which
include
food,
clothing,
and
personal
incidentals
shelter
cause
and
a
few
special
need
items.
texas
uses
a
single
standard
for
all
welfare
recipients
in
the
state
regardless
of
the
category
under
which
the
recipient
receives
as
assistance.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
no,
that’s
not
exactly
right,
your
honor.
what
happens
is
texas
has
a
standard
budgetary
allowance.
so
for
example
shelter
needs
are
budgeted
according
to
the
household
size
and
not
according
to
the
category.
similarly,
personal
needs
are
budgeted
according
to
age.
adults
in
the
adc
program,
the
caretaker,
the
mother
caring
for
children
receive
the
same
budget
and
needs
not
receive
but
are
budgeted
for
the
same
needs
as
adults
in
the
aid
to
the
blind
program
or
old
age
assistance
program.
children,
the
dependents
of
an
old
age
recipient
or
dependents
of
an
adc
mother
are
budgeted
for
the
same
amount
in
each
program.
texas
has
made
a
judgment
and
we
do
not
challenge
it
in
this
case.
the
children
require
less
per
month
than
an
adult
to
supply
the
same
minimum
needs.
but
we
have
not
challenged
that
in
this
lawsuit.
an
example
of
how
this
work
is
at
page
41
and
42
of
our
brief
that
might
be
helpful
if
i
refer
to
that.
in
table
one,
we
have
set
forth
an
age
couple
both
receiving
old
age
assistance,
that’s
at
page
41,
and
the
state
has
determined
that
for
each
month
that
couple
needs
a
$172.00
per
month
for
a
personal
and
shelter
needs.
on
page
42
at
table
two,
is
a
mother
and
three
children
who
received
afdc
from
the
state
of
texas.
their
monthly
needs
have
been
defined
by
the
state
of
texas
now
to
be
$182.00
a
month
or
just
slightly
more
than
the
two-person
family
receiving
oaa.
now,
these
amounts
for
both
families
are
approximately
$2,100.00
a
year
and
ask
the
court
to
bear
in
mind
that
this
standard
is
far
from
generous.
the
united
states
defined
the
official
poverty
levels
about
$3,900.00
a
year
for
a
family
or
poor
and
the
bureau
of
labor
statistics,
level
of
living
budget
is
over
$6,500.00
a
year.
in
any
case,
we
are
not
challenging
in
this
lawsuit,
the
fact
that
texas
defines
the
needs
of
a
family
of
four
with
three
children
to
be
only
slightly
greater
than
the
needs
of
the
family
of
two.
we
accept
that
judgment.
texas
has
made
it.
we
are
not
questioning
it.
we
also
are
not
questioning
the
fact
that
that
standard
for
both
of
those
families
is
defined
so
inadequately.
that’s
not
an
issue
in
this
lawsuit.
we
again
accept
that
judgment.
our
position
is
that
having
determined
the
subsistence
needs
of
both
families.
texas
may
not
discriminate
in
the
percentage
of
those
needs
that
chooses
to
meet
for
the
various
groups
of
recipients.
in
practical
term,
what
has
happened
is
that
texas
has
called
the
family
in
table
one
that
since
they
are
needy
and
since
they
are
dependent
because
they
are
old,
the
state
will
guarantee
them
whatever
they
need
to
purchase
a
subsistence
diet
and
adequate
shelter
according
to
texas’
judgment
in
any
case.
while
at
the
same
time,
the
state
has
hold
the
children
in
table
two
that
since
they
are
equal
need
and
their
dependence
is
cause
by
the
death
or
absence
or
incapacity
of
their
father.
the
state
will
only
have
them
purchase
50%
of
what
the
state
says
they
need
to
survive.
at
the
outset,
we
wish
to
make
clear
for
the
court
that
the
discrimination
in
the
percent
of
needs
pay
is
not
related
to
any
differences
in
the
requirements
of
the
various
recipients.
as
we
have
mentioned,
the
percentage
reduction
is
applied
after
the
standard
of
need
is
a
computed.
therefore
if
there
are
any
differences
in
need
in
these
particular
families
for
instance,
economies
of
scale
because
there
a
lot
more
members
of
the
household,
or
maybe
a
blind
recipient
needs
to
seeing
live
again
and
of
course
an
afdc
family
normally
would
not.
those
will
be
reflected
in
the
standard
of
need
before
the
percentages
are
thought.
we’re
dealing
with
families
that
texas
has
said
after
it
computes
the
standard
or
equally
needy.
as
the
department
of
health
education
and
welfare
pointed
out
a
brief
in
the
district
court
of
alabama
which
i
submitted
to
this
court
in
whitfield
versus
king.
the
percentage
reduction
as
applied
is
essentially
a
physical
measure.
it
is
unrelated
to
the
needs
of
the
various
recipients.
we
also
ask
the
court
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
percentage
reduction
in
this
case
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
availability
or
none
availability
of
other
sources
of
income.
when
income
is
actually
available
to
a
particular
recipient
whether
it
be
an
oaa
recipient
or
an
afdc
recipient,
for
example,
child
support
to
the
adc
mother,
social
security
benefits
for
the
oaa
family,
that
income
is
subtracted
from
the
grant.
there
aren’t
any
double
benefits
we
are
contending
with
here.
so
the
percentage
reduction
has
nothing
to
do
with
that.
in
fact,
the
way
texas
applies
to
percentage
reduction
to
do
the
afdc
family
actually
operates
as
a
work
disincentive.
unlike
no
in
the
dandridge
versus
williams
case
involving
family
maximums
that
this
court
decided.
texas
does
not
encourage
an
afdc
recipient
to
seek
nonwelfare
sources
of
income.
since
it’s
impossible
for
the
texas
afdc
family
to
use
that
income
to
get
closer
and
closer
to
the
standard
of
need
because
the
way
texas
applies
the
percentage
reduction
is
it
applies
it
for
the
standard
first
and
then
it
subtracts
outside
income.
no
afdc
family
in
texas
could
ever
end
up
with
more
than
50%
of
its
needs.
so
it
has,
it
does
not
have
that
work
incentive
feature
the
maryland
family
maximum
and
indeed
the
supreme
court
of
california
unanimously
decided
in
case
villa
versus
hall
which
we’ve
also
supplied
to
this
court.
the
court
noted
that
this
too
was
a
work
disincentive
feature
and
specifically
referred
to
the
texas
budgetary
method
which
is
similar
to
california.
it
is
this
aspect
that
the
percentage
reduction
is
used
by
texas
which
gives
rise
to
a
social
security
act
claim.
and
with
the
court’s
indulgence,
i’d
like
to
finish
the
statement
of
the
case
with
the
facts
they
gave
rise
to
a
statutory
claim
and
then
returned
to
the
argument.
prior
to
may
1969,
the
family
described
in
table
two
receiving
afdc
was
determined
by
texas
to
need
approximately
$165.00
per
month
under
the
texas
standard
of
need.
since
at
that
time,
texas
used
that
standard
to
determine
the
amount
of
payment
and
eligibility
for
payments
or
all
person
families
with
income
less
than
this
amount
receive
some
benefits.
the
precise
amount
depends
on
whether
or
not
there
are
budget
deficits.
the
standard
of
need
minus
their
available
income
exceeded
the
maximum
grant
level
then
in
effect
in
texas.
if
it
did,
they
only
receive
the
maximum.
effective
may
1,
1969,
consistent
with
one
of
the
mandates
of
section
402
(a)
23
which
is
the
subject
of
the
court
in
rosado
decision,
texas
adjusted
its
standard
of
need
by
11%.
the
cost
of
living
increased
since
that
standard
was
last
priced
in
1965.
we
are
not
challenging
the
adequacy
of
that
adjustment
in
this
case.
as
a
result,
the
family
in
table
two
now
is
determined
by
texas
to
need
$17.00
per
month
more
or
now
$182.00
per
month.
additional
families
therefore,
those
with
income
below
this
new
standard
of
a
$182.00
but
above
the
pre
may
1969
standard
of
a
$165.00
have
now
been
determined
by
the
state
of
texas
to
be
in
need
of
public
assistance.
but
on
that
day,
texas
stopped
using
its
standard
of
need
as
the
afdc
yardstick
against
which
income
would
be
compared
and
that
--
mr.
steven
j.
cole
no,
i
am
not
your
honor.
the
family
before
may
1969
received
when
they
changed
the
new
policy
and
adjust
the
standard
received
the
full
difference
between
the
standard
of
need
and
their
available
income
limited
--
mr.
steven
j.
cole
they
got
$65.
right!
the
only
limitation
was
there
was
a
family
maximum
on
grants
which
in
texas
at
that
time
was
a
$123.00.
so
if
there
budget
deficit
was
greater
than
$123.00,
they
only
receive
the
$123.00.
that
was
the
system
that
was
upheld
in
dandridge
versus
williams.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
okay.
now,
the
standard
has
been
raised.
the
standard
now
is
$182.00.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
but
at
time
the
suit
was
brought
the
percentage
factor
was
50%,
so
let’s
use
that
figure.
the
50%
is
multiplied
against
the
$182.00
which
results
it
in
an
item
which
texas
called
recognizable
needs
even
though
the
standard
of
need
is
a
$182.00
and
that
recognizable
need
is
$91.00.
the
family
with
income
of
$100.00
now,
receives
no
benefits.
not
only
does
it
receive
no
benefits
but
the
family
since
it’s
not
receiving
a
cash
welfare
grant
loses
complete
medicaid
coverage.
there
was
medicaid
in
the
state
of
texas
and
in
half
the
states
is
condition
on
the
receipt
of
public
assistance.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
it
was
made
may
1,
1969
and
it
was
the
policy
that’s
now
being
challenged
by
amended
complaint
in
this
lawsuit.
by
the
way,
the
medicaid
consequences
which
i
refer
to
are
not
minimum.
the
solicitor
general
has
told
the
court
that
for
the
average
of
afdc
family
it
amounts
to
about
$50.00
to
$60.00
per
month.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
congress
has
mandated
in
title
19
of
the
social
security
act
that
medicaid
assistance
be
provided
only
to
those
persons
receiving
aid
under
one
of
the
cash
welfare
programs.
since
that
person
is
now
still
needy,
they’re
not
receiving
a
dollar
grant
and
they
lose
medicaid
eligibility.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
that’s
right.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
that’s
exactly
right.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
yes.
your
honor,
we
are
not
maintaining
in
this
lawsuit
that
texas
must
pay
full
needs.
i’d
like
to
make
that
clear.
texas
could
establish
any
presented
reduction
it
wishes
under
the
rosado
decision
as
long
as
it
pays
some
benefits
to
those
families
with
a
need.
that
is
if
it
wants
to
pay
only
10%
of
benefits
but
it
applies
that
to
the
budget
deficit
after
it
subtracts
the
income
then
the
medicaid
consequences
would
not
attach
because
the
family
will
get
some
dollar
benefits.
what
happen
in
texas
beginning
may
1969
is
that
2500
family
who
were
previous
families
who
were
previously
receiving
afdc
became
ineligible
by
the
operation
of
the
new
system
that
was
stipulated
by
the
state
and
of
course
the
new
families
who
were
rendered
needy
by
the
adjustment
to
the
standard
of
need,
those
marginal
income
families
were
kept
off
the
rolls.
it
is
this
that
gives
rise
to
a
statutory
claim
since
texas
managed
to
cancel
out
the
one
practical
effect.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
yes,
sir.
absolutely
or
at
least
only
earn
90
if
they
could
manage
that
or
only
receive
90.
there
are
other
factors
other
than
work.
the
father
is
deciding
whether
they
support
their
families.
every
dollar
of
support
goes
to
the
state
treasury
as
opposed
to
helping
that
family
reach
the
standard
of
need.
and
let’s
remember
the
standard
of
need
is
what
texas
defines
as
that
basic
requirement
to
subsistence
living.
so
families
below
that
standard
--
mr.
steven
j.
cole
the
solicitor
general
has
told
the
court
that
the
average
afdc
family
receives
$50.00
to
$60.00
a
month
medicaid.
i
don’t
think
i
have
to
belabor
the
point
that
medical
care
could
mean
like
itself
and
if
we
are
dealing
after
all
what
families
who
don’t
even
have
enough
to
supply
under
texas’
own
terms
enough
food,
clothing
and
shelter
to
their
families.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
first
of
all,
this
is
a
class
action
and
there’s
stipulation,
there
are
2500
families
in
texas
eligibility
was
effective
by
this,
that’s
number
one
and
mrs.
davilla
was
a
plaintiff
in
a
consolidated
case.
the
reason
she
did
not
appeal
is
not
available
to
me.
i
don’t
know
the
reasons.
it’s
perhaps
because
the
jefferson
point
this
appeal
and
she
thought
she
was
protected
but
more
important
than
that,
one
of
the
appellants
that
is
before
the
court
mr.
vasquez
is
presently
earning
income.
he
was
not
when
the
complaint
was
filed.
he
is
now
receiving
some
disability
benefits.
now,
but
they
weren’t
enough
to
defeat
his
eligibility.
the
manner
of
computing
the
payment
affects
him
seriously
because
if
the
percentage
were
applied
after
his
income
is
subtracted,
he
would
receive
the
much
higher
grant.
it’s
our
contention
that
mr.
vasquez
even
if
you
don’t
want
to
consider
the
unnamed
members
of
the
class
who
were
not
before
the
court
now
that
mr.
vasquez
has
an
interest
in
the
computation
method
and
he
is
raising
the
eligibility
consequences
since
if
the
court
agrees
with
this
on
that
point,
we’ll
have
to
strike
the
texas
method
and
he
will
get
an
increase
grant
as
a
result.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
yes,
sir.
i’d
like
to
conclude
on
this
factual
statement
by
pointing
out
that
this
effect
of
making
these
additional
needy
families
eligible
was
precisely
what
mr.
justice
harlan
referred
to
in
the
rosado
opinion
is
the
one
practical
effect
in
his
statute
under
which
we’re
litigating
to
make
this
largely
needy
families
eligible
for
the
care
and
training
provisions
of
the
act.
with
respect
to
our
equal
protection
claim,
our
position
is
that
the
district
court
incorrectly
measured
the
discrimination
against
afdc
recipients
according
to
the
traditionally
lenient
equal
protection
test.
frankly,
we
believe
that
the
treatment
of
afdc
recipient
has
a
racial
purpose
to
it.
in
light
of
the
enormous
racial
imbalance
in
the
various
welfare
categories,
the
law
of
history
of
restrictive
measures
against
afdc
recipient
in
texas
which
are
borne
most
heavily
on
blacks
in
the
program,
the
states
decision
to
allocate
funds
as
it
has
with
this
little
room
for
any
other
inference,
this
is
particularly
so
when
appellees
almost
frivolous
explanation
to
add
it
to
the
picture.
i’d
like
to
discuss
them
in
a
moment.
our
case
however,
does
not
depend
in
this
court’s
finding
a
racial
purpose
to
the
discrimination.
in
dandridge,
the
court
said
that
even
if
the
state
welfare
regulation
is
not
drawn
on
its
face
in
racial
terms
but
if
shown
to
have
a
racially
discriminatory
effect
it
will
be
inherently
suspect
and
subject
to
restrict
judicial
review
by
the
court.
this
is
just
such
a
case,
i
first
like
to
set
out
a
very
briefly
to
court
the
racial
impact
of
what
texas
has
done
and
then
review
the
explanations
put
forth
to
the
huge
disparities.
of
a
total
of
389,000
welfare
recipients
in
the
state,
46%
of
them
are
white,
54%
of
them
are
black
or
mexican-american.
in
comparison,
the
racial
and
ethnic
distribution
within
each
category
strike
an
afdc,
it’s
not
54%
black
or
mexican-american;
it’s
87%
black
and
mexican-american.

it’s
about
44.6%
black,
40%
mexican
of
the
85%
or
86%.
yes,
so
the
black
and
mexicans
are
evenly
divided,
yes,
sir.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
the
oaa
program
is
not
a
majority
black
or
mexican
as
we
might
have
expected
but
its
63%
white.
in
setting
its
payment
levels,
texas
has
selected
a
one
classification
that
enables
the
most
whites
to
be
benefited
by
the
states
allocation
while
at
the
same
time
the
greatest
number
of
blacks
and
mexicans
are
disadvantaged.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
yes
sir,
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
we
have
set
forth
two
trials.
one,
as
of
october
1970
which
was
the
latest
published
information
we
had
from
the
department
health,
education,
and
welfare,
we
list
about
20
states
that
have
a
percentage
of
disparity.
in
appendix
b,
we
have
selected
those
states
disparities
as
great
as
texas
was
25%
as
of
today.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
at
1
(b)
of
our
brief,
it’s
the
very
last
page
of
the
brief
and
if
you’ll
notice
those
seven
states
whose
percentage
disparity
as
great
as
texas
is,
five
of
those
states
present
a
racial
disparity
very
similar
to
texas.
with
this
racial
impact
in
mind,
we
asked
the
court
to
consider
texas’
justification
for
selecting
the
afdc
recipients
to
bear
the
sole
grant
of
the
state
physical
limitations.
we
think
their
justification
is
so
rational
that
the
court
to
decide
this
case
in
our
favor
using
the
traditional
test.
there
are
three
sets
of
explanations,
there’s
a
practical
one
in
the
record,
there’s
a
lawyer’s
justification
and
there’s
the
one
that
district
court
use.
the
practical
justification
is
this,
the
three-judge
court
below
asked
counsel
whether
there
was
anything
in
the
record
that
would
support
this
discrimination.
the
attorney
general’s
response
was
and
i
quote,
it’s
at
page
71
of
the
oral
argument.
“we’ve
got
just
so
much
money
in
each
of
this
program
to
spend.”
well,
this
is
undoubtedly
true.
but
what
we
are
challenging
here
is
the
legislature’s
allocation
of
the
money.
now,
that
takes
the
question
before
the
court.
now,
we
remind
the
court
that
since
1965,
the
texas
constitution
has
given
the
legislature
complete
flexibility
and
appropriations.
it
has
only
a
total
sealing.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
yes
sir
and
i
don’t
think
it
would
have
to
be
at
60%.
[voice
overlap]
the
reason
i
say
that
your
honor
is
because
there
are
twice
as
many
old
age
recipients
as
afdc
recipients.
so
very
--
but
yes,
sir.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
no,
unless
the
texas
constitution
was
amended,
it
would
not
be
a
100%
across
the
board
but
they
do
have
flexibility
before
65
they
didn’t.
the
texas
constitution
said
a
certain
limited
amount
for
adc
and
a
certain
limited
amount
for
old
age
assistance.
that
is
no
longer
the
case.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
no,
sir.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
if
the
texas
constitution
state
as
it
is,
that
would
be
the
result,
yes.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
no,
but
frankly
your
honor,
we
do
believe
and
this
is
not
a
legal
judgment
to
be
made
either
by
us
or
the
court
that
if
that
question
is
put
to
the
texas
people,
the
constitutional
sealing
will
be
raise.
but
it’s
true
that
if
we
win,
we’re
not
requiring
the
state
to
spend
more
money
and
it
would
be
a
reallocation.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
right,
the
stipulations
make
clear
that
texas
is
fully
spending
its
appropriation
on
the
other
categories
and
then
you
have
to
come
from
somewhere.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
we
do
not
know.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
your
honor,
my
position
would
be
that
they
stand
in
the
same
position
as
the
favorite
class
in
almost
every
equal
protection
case
that’s
before
the
court.
i
think
the
thing
that’s
troubling
you
is,
we’re
dealing
here
with
a
pot
of
money
not
eligibility
for
public
housing
or
a
regulation
of
business
but
it’s
always
true
that
the
favorite
class
stand
to
lose
its
favorite
treatment
if
the
disfavored
class
wins
the
lawsuit.
and
under
rule
19,
i
don’t
think
this
court
has
ever
required
that
disfavored
class
to
be
brought
before
the
court.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
i
suppose
that’s
right
to
the
extent
that
the
texas
constitution
limits
the
present
texas
constitution
limits
the
total
expenditure.
i
would
say
this,
your
honor,
that
the
suit
obviously
had
widespread
precedent
state
of
texas
was
well
known
in
the
state
of
texas
and
i
think
it
would
be
wrong
to
say
that
the
suit
would
come
as
a
surprise
if
the
appellants
before
this
court
should
win
and
will
become
a
surprise
to
the
old
age
recipients
in
the
state.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
your
honor,
that
is
really
one
of
the
points
that
goes
to
the
heart
of
why
texas
has
done
what
they’ve
done.
25%
of
all
the
people
over
65
in
the
state
texas
receive
old
age
assistance
that’s
an
astounding
figure.
the
appellees
have
testified
quite
candidly
that
it
was
their
political
clout
that
is
basically
encouraged
the
legislature
to
appropriate
as
it
has.
mr.
bond
(ph)
who
is
the
chairman
of
public
welfare
testified
that
oaa
touches
nearly
every
home.
afdc
doesn’t
touch
as
many
people
and
the
oaa
people
have
the
votes.
now,
i
would
think
the
legislatures
have
been
responsive
to
them
and
they
must
have
some
input
in
to
the
process.
i
point
that
that
the
afdc
children
represent
less
than
3%
of
the
state’s
population
of
children
under
18
compared
to
the
oaa
percentage.
i
really
have
no
other
response
to
the
fact
that
they
have
not
been
formally
brought
before
the
court.
i
will
point
that
the
state
of
texas
is
never
made
any
motions
to
bring
them
before
the
court
either
for
whatever
that’s
worth.
i’d
like
to
point
out
that
the
record
shows
that
the
welfare
officials
would
equalize
if
the
legislature
appropriated
at
a
lump
sum.
mr.
bond’s
deposition
again
indicated
that.
so,
there
is
no
welfare
related
reason
for
this.
the
welfare
expert
says,
if
you
give
me
a
lump
sum
that’s
what
i
would
do.
i’d
have
a
percentage
across
the
board
but
they
haven’t
given
him
a
lump
sum
even
though
the
constitution
permits
it.
the
lawyer’s
justification
was
that
the
discrimination
is
justified
because
afdc
children
and
mothers
well,
today
employable
are
more
likely
to
be
come
employable
in
the
future
and
also
because
they’re
more
likely
to
get
support
from
relatives.
well,
future
employability
potential
obviously
has
no
bearing
on
the
rationality
of
current
payment
disparities.
the
welfare
programs
are
designed
to
meet
current
needs
and
maybe
that
would
justify
in
the
running
training
programs
by
afdc
recipients
but
it
certainly
won’t
justify
current
afdc
grants.
and
surely,
texas
won’t
suggest
that
paying
50%
of
needs
in
oaa
would
be
fair
in
light
of
the
fact
that
a
majority
of
oaa
recipients
receives
social
security,
it
just
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
question
before
court.
the
district
court
viewed
the
program
as
completely
separate
programs.
whatever
you
do
in
oaa,
you
don’t
have
to
do
an
adc
because
they’re
separate
because
we
see
an
adc
the
purpose
is
to
strengthen
family
life
and
the
purpose
of
the
other
program
is
self-care.
the
fact
is
that
texas
constitution
and
the
texas
statutes
makes
no
such
distinction.
the
purposes
are
single-minded,
financial
aid
and
rehabilitative
services.
now,
i
would
suppose
that
a
blind
person
may
need
a
different
kind
of
social
service
that
an
adc
mother
who’s
husband
just
pasted
away
but
i
would
suggest
that
those
differences
don’t
justify
a
difference
in
the
financial
assistance
you
give
to
the
family.
with
respect
to
the
statutory
claim,
section
402
(a)
23
required
each
state
by
july
1969
to
adjust
the
amounts
used
in
that
state
to
determine
a
family’s
needs
for
afdc
and
also
to
proportionally
adjust
any
maximums
that
the
state
may
have.
before
this
court
rosado
vs.
wyman,
the
petitioners
argued
that
that
section
contemplate
an
increase
in
all
afdc
payments
by
july
1969.
they
urged
that
any
other
construction
would
it
render
the
statute
of
meaningless
bookkeeping
exercise.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
okay.
i’ll
finish
the
statutory
claim,
and
if
i
have
the
time
after
to
rebuttal,
thank
you.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
your
honor,
first
of
all,
i
would
like
to
remind
the
court
that
there
are
2500
families
that
texas
has
stipulated
as
eligibilities
been
terminated
as
a
result
of
the
method
used
here.
secondly,
mr.
vasquez
whose
eligibility
has
not
been
terminated
has
lost
approximately
$40.00
a
month
by
the
method
of
computation
which
streaked
him
because
of
its
eligibility
consequences
he
would
gain
$40.00
per
month.
in
recital,
the
court
said
at
page
413
that
402
(a)
23
has
the
effect
of
requiring
the
states
to
recognize
and
accept
the
responsibility
for
those
additional
individuals
whose
income
fall
short
of
the
standard
need
is
computed
in
light
of
economic
realities
and
to
place
them
amongst
those
eligible
for
the
care
and
training
provisions
of
the
act.
the
court
said
this
because
hew
came
to
the
court
and
told
the
court,
that’s
402
(a)
23
meant
and
if
you’ll
look
at
the
amicus
brief
for
this
solicitor
general
in
recital,
you
will
find
those
words.
the
solicitor
general
in
this
case
says
that
yes
the
court
said
it
but
that
was
dictum
and
he
didn’t
really
mean
to
say
it
and
i
think
if
the
court
looks
at
the
basis
for
the
decision
in
the
new
york
case
in
light
throughout
new
york’s
program,
you
will
realize
it
wasn’t
dictum
at
all.
thank
you.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
j.
cole
they
are
all
competing
interests
amongst
the
class
which
was
when
the
suit
was
brought
to
find
these
all
afdc
recipients
in
the
state.
the
original
contentions
in
the
suit
were
indeed
that
payments
had
to
increase
for
everybody.
that
was
rejected
in
recital.
of
course
when
payments
had
to
increase,
so
did
eligibility
that
flowed
with
it.
on
remand,
when
the
payments
increased
question
which
no
longer
a
viable
question
because
of
recital
there
was
diverging
claims
i
supposed
and
--
mr.
steven
j.
cole
your
honor,
i
can’t,
i
personally
can’t
respond
to
that
because
i
was
not
a
district
court
level
in
this
case.
