unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
children
under
the
afdc
have
the
same
standard
of
need
as
blind
adults
or
disabled
adults
or
people
over
65?
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
that
before
1965
when
the
standard
of
need
was
al
$165.00,
a
family
before
received
a
$165.00?
unknown
speaker
as
one
earns
$100.00
a
month
and
the
standard
of
need
with
$165.00,
they
got
$65.00?
unknown
speaker
what’s
the
difference
where
you
said
that
it
gets
$65.00
difference
between
$100.00
and
$165.00?
what’s
the
situation
today
where
one
still
earns
a
hundred?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
this
change
you
say
was
made
may
1969?
unknown
speaker
and
why
is
it
that
you
say
they
lose
those
benefits?
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
one
who
earns
a
hundred
entitled
only
to
91
gets
nothing?
unknown
speaker
and
therefore
he
also
gets
no
medicaid?
unknown
speaker
where
as
back
in
where
they
have
the
$165.00
or
they
get
$65.00
and
also
get
medicaid?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
my
hypothetical
of
family
earning
a
hundred
is
now
entitled
to
nothing.
it
would
be
better
for
them,
i
gather
simply
the
quick
work
then
get
the
91
plus
medicaid,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
does
medicaid
for
your
family
enable
to
--
you
said
it
runs
about
$50.00
to
$60.00
a
month?
unknown
speaker
divided
how?
unknown
speaker
[voice
overlap]
for
about
half
and
half
or
--
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
are
there
other
states
who
have
followed
this
types
of
problems?
unknown
speaker
what
page
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
if
they
wanted
to
spend
no
more
than
they
now
spend,
they
can
level
out
the
percentage
for
all
four
categories
say
at
60%?
unknown
speaker
i
gather
your
premise
is,
it
would
not
be
a
100%
across
the
board?
unknown
speaker
however,
in
this
case
you
have
all
the
aspects
of
a
common
fund
that
seems
to
me
a
limited
amount
of
money
that
you
haven’t
had
and
some
of
those
other
cases.
unknown
speaker
do
you
say
there’s
a
constitutional
limitation
on
the
total
amount?
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
in
the
state
constitution,
that
$80
million?
unknown
speaker
as
a
figure,
it
is
not
a
pointer
--
unknown
speaker
this
is
done
by
referendum?
unknown
speaker
a
majority
vote?
unknown
speaker
but
who
fixed
those
percentages?
unknown
speaker
but
did
the
legislature
say
that
afdc
shall
have
“x”
dollars
out
of
80
million.
unknown
speaker
old
checks
dollars
out
of
80
million,
is
that
the
way
it
was
done?
unknown
speaker
does
the
legislature
said
out
of
the
80
million,
40
million
shall
go
to
the
afdc?
what
you’re
telling
is
i
gather
that
they
could
not
pay
more
than
50%
of
need
and
stay
within
40
million.
unknown
speaker
and
the
others
stated
a
100%,
do
they?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
you’re
talk
about
more
of
the
public
funds
for
the
aged
or
for
the
blind
or
for
the
disabled.
in
fact,
is
that
true?
how
much
of
the
$80
million
goes
to
afdc
now?
unknown
speaker
that
$23
million
goes
to
afdc
--
unknown
speaker
and
about
how
much
goes
to
each
of
the
others?
about
i
--
unknown
speaker
they’re
not
many
people
who
are
blind?
unknown
speaker
so
that
$50
million
out
of
the
$80
million
goes
to
old
age
assistance?
unknown
speaker
and
the
fact
is,
as
your
brother
said
i
guess
it’s
at
25%
of
everybody
over
65
in
texas
gets
old
age
assistance?
unknown
speaker
one
of
every
four
people
over
65
in
the
state?
unknown
speaker
mr.
bailey
you’ve
been
making
--
i
gather
these
are
constitutional?
unknown
speaker
it’s
so
constitutional,
are
you
going
to
get
to
the
statutory?
unknown
speaker
because
i
gather
if
this
system
conflicts
with
any
requirement
of
the
federal
statute
then
it
can’t
stand,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
there’s
never
been
a
reduction
in
afdc;
you’re
talking
about
total
money
appropriated?
unknown
speaker
but
there
has,
has
it
not
or
am
i
mistaken
been
a
reduction
in
the
percentage
given
to
--
unknown
speaker
to
units
based
on
percentage
of
standard
of
need,
there
has
been
a
reduction
on
that,
hasn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
total
money
spent.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bailey,
you’re
speaking
in
terms
know
of
absolute
numbers,
are
you
not
rather
than
the
percentages?
i
take
it
that
the
appellants’
response
would
be
that
although
the
absolute
numbers
might
be
the
same
the
percentages
are
a
good
deal
different?
unknown
speaker
what’s
the
respective
which
you
suggest
that
an
eligibility
has
not
been
determined
that
is
required
by
the
federal
statute?
unknown
speaker
i
know.
what
do
you
understand
these
appellants
to
say?
is
the
effect
in
determination
of
eligibility
in
light
of
the
federal
requirement?
unknown
speaker
does
that
possibly
relate
to
the
ineligibility
for
medicaid
for
at
least
for
the
operation
of
new
computation?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
about
the
class?
i
gather
the
--
unknown
speaker
you
mean
the
absolute
dollar
amount
would
be
--
unknown
speaker
[voice
overlap]
the
dollar
amount?
unknown
speaker
but
still
i
gather
they’d
be
getting
percentage
wise
if
they
prevail,
the
same
percentage
as
the
other
categories
of
need?
unknown
speaker
do
you
understand
the
appellants’
statutory
requirement
to
be
limited
to
a
claim
that
eligibility
determinations
contravene
the
eligibility
of
the
determination
requirements
under
federal
law?
unknown
speaker
opening
up
medicaid
to
sick?
unknown
speaker
mr.
bailey,
on
the
case
or
controversy
point,
i
understood
mr.
cole
to
say
that
appellant
vasquez
was
sufficiently
effective
by
the
eligibility
determinations
so
as
to
enable
them
to
properly
raise
that
would
be
actual
parties
they
have
before
this
court.
unknown
speaker
mr.
cole.
unknown
speaker
can
i
ask
you
one
hopefully
final
question
about
something
mr.
bailey
raised.
at
least,
a
couple
of
your
client
here,
mrs.
jefferson,
mrs.
gibson
are
and
are
presently
eligible
under
the
texas
standard
and
as
i
understand
his
contention,
you’re
arguing
that
these
eligibilities
standard
should
be
broadened
in
such
a
way
that
more
people
would
become
eligible
for
what
a
fixed
amount
of
money
and
that
therefore
this
particular
clients
of
yours
would
not
gain
but
lose
financially
if
your
contention
is
sustained.
what’s
your
response
to
that?
unknown
speaker
no
thought
was
given
to
getting
separate
counsel?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
children
