justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
cole,
i
believe
that
the
respondent
in
his
brief
makes
a
point
that
all
of
the
parties’
appellant
presently
in
the
case
have
not
lost
their
eligibility
as
a
result
of
what
you
claim
to
be
texas’
violation
of
the
statute,
mrs.
davilla
having
been
dismissed
as
an
appellant
in
october
1969.
what
is
your
answer
to
that
contention?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
say
his
interest
is
sufficient
to
enable
you
to
raise
the
point?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
cole,
you’re
not
challenging
on
federal
constitutional
ground
the
overall
texas
sealing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
if
you
prevail
basically
the
afdc
people
will
get
more
out
of
common
fund
and
the
other
categorical
grants
would
get
less,
is
that
right?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you’re
not
challenging
the
texas
constitution?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
take
it
from
the
stipulations
on
file
that
this
would
result
in
a
lowering
of
the
benefits
received
from
the
categorical
--
in
the
other
categorical
grant,
the
old
age
assistance,
and
blind
assistance.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no
effort
was
made
either
by
the
respondent
or
by
you
to
join
any
representative
members
of
this
other
classes
who
would
suffer
if
your
contention
prevails?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
have
any
position
as
to
whether
under
rule
19
may
or
should
have
enjoined?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
how
can
you
say
that?
this
is
a
group
scattered
widely
over
texas
not
represented
by
anyone
so
far
as
we
are
informed
on
this
record?
