unknown
speaker
well,
what
you
mean
when
you
say
adult
material,
you
mean
that
it
is
material
that
deals
explicitly
with
sex
book.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
what
it
is.
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
what
the
whole
contents
of
the
store?
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
material,
do
you
--
was
it
all
--
was
it
all
literary
or
pictorial
material?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
mean
to
say,
was
it
--
it
was
all
literary
or
pictorial
was
it
or
did
involve
articles
of
clothing
or
things
like
that?
unknown
speaker
it
is
all
literary
and
pictures.
unknown
speaker
alright.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me
mr.
smith,
may
i
ask,
in
this
florida
statutory
scheme,
is
this
business
of
a
procedure
by
which
the
vendor’s
place
of
business
could
be
closed.
is
that
a
section
of
the
general
statutory
scheme
dealing
with
obscenity?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
but
are
there
not
also
provisions
for
injunction
against
distribution
and
sale
in
that
procedure?
unknown
speaker
and
this
procedure
is
what?
unknown
speaker
a
nuisance.
and
that
is
independently
the
injunction?
unknown
speaker
now,
in
either
case
or
there
either
procedure
is
employed
may
it
then
be
followed
by
criminal
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
that
does
not
answer
my
question.
then
i
gather
either
the
injunction
procedure
or
this
closing
procedure
may
be
conducted
independently
of
any
criminal
proceeding.
unknown
speaker
is
that
not
it?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
to
be
sure
not
integrated
with
any
criminal
proceeding.
unknown
speaker
what
happened
to
them?
they
have
been
destroyed?
unknown
speaker
this
was
in
another
case?
unknown
speaker
with
mitchum?
unknown
speaker
and
involving
the
same
material?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
florida
supreme
court?
unknown
speaker
in
this
case
--
unknown
speaker
what
sort
of
case
was
this
then?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
but
the
store
remains
closed
down?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
could
you
have
gone
any
further
that
on
the
florida
courts?
unknown
speaker
for
the
entry
of
-the
modifying
order
--
unknown
speaker
of
the
modifying
order?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
--
what
about
--
what
is
your
position
with
respect
to
the
--
what
is
left
with
the
order?
unknown
speaker
and
do
we
have
a
--
unknown
speaker
it
starts
now,
i
take
it
if
she
can
afford
it
she
can
open
the
store
tomorrow.
and
with
everything
except
those
two
–
unknown
speaker
that
will
be
for
judge
fitzpatrick
--.
unknown
speaker
he
withdrew
his
injunction
closing
the
store?
unknown
speaker
where
is
that
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
and
if
knowing
that,
mr.
smith,
that
if
the
present
state
of
the
judgment
below
does
not
raise
this
question
that
they
have
offered?
unknown
speaker
how
do
we
have
a
judgment
before
us
that
under
which
we
can
deal
with
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
the
three-judge
court
has
had
before
it
this
order
of
november
29,
would
they
not
have
been
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
--
unknown
speaker
well,
in
doing
nothing,
no
other
reason.
unknown
speaker
do
you
understood
in
sustaining
the
--
in
this
case
the
power
of
the
three-judge
court
to
issue
an
injunction.
unknown
speaker
but
did
you
raise
the
--
did
you
raise
the
facial
attack
in
the
state
court?
unknown
speaker
before
judge
fitzpatrick?
unknown
speaker
and
was
it
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
did
not
you
say
that
what
you
submitted
--
did
i
understand
you
correctly?
you
followed
what
england
said
when
he
submitted
that
the
constitutional
question
to
the
state
court,
you
said
you
are
not
however,
waiving
your
right
to
come
back
to
the
federal
court.
unknown
speaker
on
those
issues
that
had
decided
it
?
unknown
speaker
you
did
not
believe
it,
they
may
not
have
raised
it
but
the
state
proceeding
was
underway
before
the
federal
proceeding.
unknown
speaker
as
i
recall.
unknown
speaker
and
england
was
a
substantial
case
and
it
has
been
interesting.
unknown
speaker
and
except
--.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
is
this
--
is
this
an
argument
that
1983
is
within
the
--
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
special
authorization
exception
under
2283,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
means
we
have
to
read
them?
what
do
we
do?
read
2283
out
of
the
picture
entirely?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
we
said
that
only
a
couple
weeks
ago
in
another
case,
national
labor
relations
board.
unknown
speaker
but
what
is
the
right
to
the
united
states
government?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words
--
unknown
speaker
not
only
is
the
united
states
not
bound
by
the
prohibitions
of
2283
but
there
is
also
something
called
the
rights
of
the
people,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
you
are
not
talking
about
the
subject.
you
are
taking
about
the
adult
public?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
the
only
good
we
are
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
the
public.
unknown
speaker
what
--
i
mean
it
is
not
the
public
in
general.
this
is
a
class
of
the
public
you
are
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
maybe
artificial
but
that
was
rather
the
whole
point
of
section
2283
which
dates
back
to
the
year
one
of
the
existence
of
this
country
as
a
nation,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
whole
point
of
it.
unknown
speaker
who
wins
the
race?
and
whoever
wins
the
race
then
the
litigation
proceeds
in
that
court
and
that
is
exactly
what
2283
has
the
effect
of
saying,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
it
goes
back
to
the
very
first
congress
of
this
nation.
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
conflict
if
the
federal
court
stays
out
if
it
and
it
is
told
to
stay
out
of
it.
unknown
speaker
that
is
exactly
as
22
--
the
purpose
--
the
evident,
self
evident,
purpose
of
2283
and
its
predecessor
was
to
keep
a
federal
court
out
of
it
and
thereby
to
avoid
conflict.
would
you
agree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
would
you
not
agree
also
mr.
smith
that
the
federal
judges
have
no
monopoly
on
enforcing
the
federal
constitution?
unknown
speaker
that
is
simply
the
responsibility
of
a
state
judge,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well
then
i
do
not
quite
follow
you,
the
state
courts
do
not
have
one
with
different
responsibility
from
federal
judges.
unknown
speaker
on
the
rationale
that
we
have
seen
and
we
have
said
in
the
younger
line
of
cases.
it
was
of
course
harassment,
bad
faith.
but
is
that
suggest
today?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
because
expressly
saying
that
the
question
in
those
cases.
unknown
speaker
yes.
but
atlantic
coast
line,
there
was
not
any
question
of
harassment
or
the
lack
of
good
faith.
and
you
get
a
state
prosecution
that
is
--
that
lacks
good
faith,
what
you
are
really
saying
is
--
it
is
not
a
state
prosecution
at
all.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
it
does
not
qualify
as
a
prosecution.
unknown
speaker
but
if
it
a
harassment
which
--
unknown
speaker
well,
but
younger
and
harris
and
atlantic
cases
said
that
question.
unknown
speaker
by
all
saying
that
you
could
have
an
authority.
unknown
speaker
in
an
unusual
circumstances.
unknown
speaker
am
i
correct
that
since
that
time
the
state
court
have
opened
up
the
place
and
it
removed
the
bar
against
doing
business
and
it
returned
all
the
books
except
those
nine
books,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
all
that
relief
was
granted
in
the
state
court.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
you
said
the
books
were
given
back
earlier.
unknown
speaker
so
as
of
now,
you
want
is
for
us
to
declare
the
statute
unconstitutional.
unknown
speaker
three-judge
court,
no?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
mr.
smith
that
and
you
would
agree
that
the
1983
seems
within
the
expressed
authorization
exception,
would
not
have
to
deal
with
this
public
rights,
public
--
private
rights.
unknown
speaker
but
you
would
still
have
to
deal
with
younger
and
harris.
unknown
speaker
but
you
would
still
have
to
deal
with
whether
the
younger
and
harris
rationale
applies
to
civil
cases
as
well
as
criminal.
unknown
speaker
because
younger
and
harris
was
in
1983
--.
unknown
speaker
is
that
cited
in
your
brief,
did
you
say?
unknown
speaker
448,
456?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
the
district
court
did
not,
in
view
of
its
understanding
of
the
effect
of
2283,
the
district
court
did
not
--
did
it
consider
any
questions
of
whether
or
not
there
was
an
harassment
here,
the
court
was
absolute,
the
injunction
was
absolutely
barred,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
singular
judge.
i
am
not
talking
about
the
district
court’s
final
order
in
this
case,
with
that
i
mean
three-judge
district
court
unknown
speaker
whether
or
not
there
was
harassment,
the
court
thought
it
was
barred
from
issuing
an
injunction,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
so,
it
has
never
had
an
opportunity
to
consider
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
there
was
the
kind
of
harassment
that
would
have
made
this
case
one
of
the
exceptional
situations
referred
to
in
younger
and
its
companion
cases
because
of
its
view
that
2283
wholly
barred
the
injunction,
regardless
of
whether
or
not
there
was
harassment.
unknown
speaker
is
that
--
that
is
the
way
you
understand
his
opinion?
unknown
speaker
you
would
hinder
that
issue
of
harassment?
unknown
speaker
do
you
say
that
the
federal
court
properly
proceeded
to
grant
for
declaratory
relief?
unknown
speaker
or
would
you
say
that
they
properly
could
proceed?.
unknown
speaker
your
point
is
that
that
is
a
question
you
need
not
answer
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
or,
and
that
we
need
not
answer
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
well
then
that
is
in
hobbs?
unknown
speaker
but
in
that
case,
i
understand
you
just
told
us
bad
faith
and
harassment
was
stipulated
not
to
exist.
in
the
present
case,
that
is
never
been
litigated.
unknown
speaker
no.
unknown
speaker
mr.
marky,
what
is
your
answer
to
your
brother’s
argument
that
he
did
alleged
harassment
and
bad
faith,
he
is
at
least
entitled
to
a
hearing
in
the
district
court
on
those
allegations.
unknown
speaker
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
that.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
you
are
arguing
that
2253
is
a
complete
bar
even
if
he
can
show
harassment
and
bad
faith
so
long
as
the
pending
state
proceeding
is
a
civil
proceeding,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
so
i
know
but
i
thought
the
--
unknown
speaker
younger
points
the
other
way,
does
it
not?
unknown
speaker
so,
i
suggest
that
it
points
the
other
way.
unknown
speaker
but
when
younger
points
this
court
decided
exactly
what
you
say
the
law
ought
to
be.
this
court,
in
this
case,
decided
this
case
just
the
way
you
say
it
should
have
decided
it.
so,
if
the
error
is
--
unknown
speaker
it
is
on
the
part
of
the
court
certainly
not
in
your
arguments.
you
are
simply
adopting
the
reasoning
of
the
district
court
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
wish
to
be
sure
that
did
not
have
the
benefit,
if
that
is
the
word,
of
our
opinions
in
younger
and
related
cases.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
smith,
if
we
should
decide
this
case
in
your
favor
on
the
inapplicability
in
this
case
for
some
reason
or
another,
if
section
2283
or
more
precisely
if
we
should
decide
either
the
2283
words
were
not
inapplicable
or
that
one
of
the
exceptions
therein
provided
were
applicable
--
applicable
this
one
in
2283.
then
what
you
are
telling
us
now
is
just
the
matter
that
you
would
then
be
permitted
to
present
to
the
district
court,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
because
that
is
never
been,
never
been
litigated
or
tried
or
even
considered
by
the
district
court,
by
the
three-judge
district
court
unknown
speaker
but
you
are
not,
for
there
is
no
point
if
you
are
arguing
those
things
to
us.
unknown
speaker
only,
except
to
you
say
that
it
is
--
it
was
in
your
complaint
and
you
brought
it
to
the
attention
of
the
district
court.
unknown
speaker
and
one
other
question
while
i
have
interrupted
you,
i
have
just
read
hobbs
against
thompson
and
so
far
as
one
and
read
all
this
trying
to
listen.
i
do
not
find
that
that
case
involved
any
application
of
2283,
did
it?
it
was
not
a
pending
state
proceeding
was
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
whatever
you
are
saying,
did
it
involve
a
pending
state
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
i
did
not
think
of
that.
unknown
speaker
right,
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
you
mean
when
you
say
adult
material,
you
mean
that
it
is
material
that
deals
explicitly
with
sex
book.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
what
it
is.
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
what
the
whole
contents
of
the
store?
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
material,
do
you
--
was
it
all
--
was
it
all
literary
or
pictorial
material?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
mean
to
say,
was
it
--
it
was
all
literary
or
pictorial
was
it
or
did
involve
articles
of
clothing
or
things
like
that?
unknown
speaker
it
is
all
literary
and
pictures.
unknown
speaker
alright.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me
mr.
smith,
may
i
ask,
in
this
florida
statutory
scheme,
is
this
business
of
a
procedure
by
which
the
vendor’s
place
of
business
could
be
closed.
is
that
a
section
of
the
general
statutory
scheme
dealing
with
obscenity?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
but
are
there
not
also
provisions
for
injunction
against
distribution
and
sale
in
that
procedure?
unknown
speaker
and
this
procedure
is
what?
unknown
speaker
a
nuisance.
and
that
is
independently
the
injunction?
unknown
speaker
now,
in
either
case
or
there
either
procedure
is
employed
may
it
then
be
followed
by
criminal
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
that
does
not
answer
my
question.
then
i
gather
either
the
injunction
procedure
or
this
closing
procedure
may
be
conducted
independently
of
any
criminal
proceeding.
unknown
speaker
is
that
not
it?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
to
be
sure
not
integrated
with
any
criminal
proceeding.
unknown
speaker
what
happened
to
them?
they
have
been
destroyed?
unknown
speaker
this
was
in
another
case?
unknown
speaker
with
mitchum?
unknown
speaker
and
involving
the
same
material?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
florida
supreme
court?
unknown
speaker
in
this
case
--
unknown
speaker
what
sort
of
case
was
this
then?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
but
the
store
remains
closed
down?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
could
you
have
gone
any
further
that
on
the
florida
courts?
unknown
speaker
for
the
entry
of
-the
modifying
order
--
unknown
speaker
of
the
modifying
order?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
--
what
about
--
what
is
your
position
with
respect
to
the
--
what
is
left
with
the
order?
unknown
speaker
and
do
we
have
a
--
unknown
speaker
it
starts
now,
i
take
it
if
she
can
afford
it
she
can
open
the
store
tomorrow.
and
with
everything
except
those
two
–
unknown
speaker
that
will
be
for
judge
fitzpatrick
--.
unknown
speaker
he
withdrew
his
injunction
closing
the
store?
unknown
speaker
where
is
that
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
and
if
knowing
that,
mr.
smith,
that
if
the
present
state
of
the
judgment
below
does
not
raise
this
question
that
they
have
offered?
unknown
speaker
how
do
we
have
a
judgment
before
us
that
under
which
we
can
deal
with
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
the
three-judge
court
has
had
before
it
this
order
of
november
29,
would
they
not
have
been
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
--
unknown
speaker
well,
in
doing
nothing,
no
other
reason.
unknown
speaker
do
you
understood
in
sustaining
the
--
in
this
case
the
power
of
the
three-judge
court
to
issue
an
injunction.
unknown
speaker
but
did
you
raise
the
--
did
you
raise
the
facial
attack
in
the
state
court?
unknown
speaker
before
judge
fitzpatrick?
unknown
speaker
and
was
it
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
did
not
you
say
that
what
you
submitted
--
did
i
understand
you
correctly?
you
followed
what
england
said
when
he
submitted
that
the
constitutional
question
to
the
state
court,
you
said
you
are
not
however,
waiving
your
right
to
come
back
to
the
federal
court.
unknown
speaker
on
those
issues
that
had
decided
it
?
unknown
speaker
you
did
not
believe
it,
they
may
not
have
raised
it
but
the
state
proceeding
was
underway
before
the
federal
proceeding.
unknown
speaker
as
i
recall.
unknown
speaker
and
england
was
a
substantial
case
and
it
has
been
interesting.
unknown
speaker
and
except
--.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
is
this
--
is
this
an
argument
that
1983
is
within
the
--
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
special
authorization
exception
under
2283,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
means
we
have
to
read
them?
what
do
we
do?
read
2283
out
of
the
picture
entirely?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
we
said
that
only
a
couple
weeks
ago
in
another
case,
national
labor
relations
board.
unknown
speaker
but
what
is
the
right
to
the
united
states
government?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words
--
unknown
speaker
not
only
is
the
united
states
not
bound
by
the
prohibitions
of
2283
but
there
is
also
something
called
the
rights
of
the
people,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
you
are
not
talking
about
the
subject.
you
are
taking
about
the
adult
public?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
the
only
good
we
are
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
the
public.
unknown
speaker
what
--
i
mean
it
is
not
the
public
in
general.
this
is
a
class
of
the
public
you
are
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
maybe
artificial
but
that
was
rather
the
whole
point
of
section
2283
which
dates
back
to
the
year
one
of
the
existence
of
this
country
as
a
nation,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
whole
point
of
it.
unknown
speaker
who
wins
the
race?
and
whoever
wins
the
race
then
the
litigation
proceeds
in
that
court
and
that
is
exactly
what
2283
has
the
effect
of
saying,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
it
goes
back
to
the
very
first
congress
of
this
nation.
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
conflict
if
the
federal
court
stays
out
if
it
and
it
is
told
to
stay
out
of
it.
unknown
speaker
that
is
exactly
as
22
--
the
purpose
--
the
evident,
self
evident,
purpose
of
2283
and
its
predecessor
was
to
keep
a
federal
court
out
of
it
and
thereby
to
avoid
conflict.
would
you
agree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
would
you
not
agree
also
mr.
smith
that
the
federal
judges
have
no
monopoly
on
enforcing
the
federal
constitution?
unknown
speaker
that
is
simply
the
responsibility
of
a
state
judge,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well
then
i
do
not
quite
follow
you,
the
state
courts
do
not
have
one
with
different
responsibility
from
federal
judges.
unknown
speaker
on
the
rationale
that
we
have
seen
and
we
have
said
in
the
younger
line
of
cases.
it
was
of
course
harassment,
bad
faith.
but
is
that
suggest
today?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
because
expressly
saying
that
the
question
in
those
cases.
unknown
speaker
yes.
but
atlantic
coast
line,
there
was
not
any
question
of
harassment
or
the
lack
of
good
faith.
and
you
get
a
state
prosecution
that
is
--
that
lacks
good
faith,
what
you
are
really
saying
is
--
it
is
not
a
state
prosecution
at
all.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
it
does
not
qualify
as
a
prosecution.
unknown
speaker
but
if
it
a
harassment
which
--
unknown
speaker
well,
but
younger
and
harris
and
atlantic
cases
said
that
question.
unknown
speaker
by
all
saying
that
you
could
have
an
authority.
unknown
speaker
in
an
unusual
circumstances.
unknown
speaker
am
i
correct
that
since
that
time
the
state
court
have
opened
up
the
place
and
it
removed
the
bar
against
doing
business
and
it
returned
all
the
books
except
those
nine
books,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
all
that
relief
was
granted
in
the
state
court.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
you
said
the
books
were
given
back
earlier.
unknown
speaker
so
as
of
now,
you
want
is
for
us
to
declare
the
statute
unconstitutional.
unknown
speaker
three-judge
court,
no?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
mr.
smith
that
and
you
would
agree
that
the
1983
seems
within
the
expressed
authorization
exception,
would
not
have
to
deal
with
this
public
rights,
public
--
private
rights.
unknown
speaker
but
you
would
still
have
to
deal
with
younger
and
harris.
unknown
speaker
but
you
would
still
have
to
deal
with
whether
the
younger
and
harris
rationale
applies
to
civil
cases
as
well
as
criminal.
unknown
speaker
because
younger
and
harris
was
in
1983
--.
unknown
speaker
is
that
cited
in
your
brief,
did
you
say?
unknown
speaker
448,
456?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
the
district
court
did
not,
in
view
of
its
understanding
of
the
effect
of
2283,
the
district
court
did
not
--
did
it
consider
any
questions
of
whether
or
not
there
was
an
harassment
here,
the
court
was
absolute,
the
injunction
was
absolutely
barred,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
singular
judge.
i
am
not
talking
about
the
district
court’s
final
order
in
this
case,
with
that
i
mean
three-judge
district
court
unknown
speaker
whether
or
not
there
was
harassment,
the
court
thought
it
was
barred
from
issuing
an
injunction,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
so,
it
has
never
had
an
opportunity
to
consider
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
there
was
the
kind
of
harassment
that
would
have
made
this
case
one
of
the
exceptional
situations
referred
to
in
younger
and
its
companion
cases
because
of
its
view
that
2283
wholly
barred
the
injunction,
regardless
of
whether
or
not
there
was
harassment.
unknown
speaker
is
that
--
that
is
the
way
you
understand
his
opinion?
unknown
speaker
you
would
hinder
that
issue
of
harassment?
unknown
speaker
do
you
say
that
the
federal
court
properly
proceeded
to
grant
for
declaratory
relief?
unknown
speaker
or
would
you
say
that
they
properly
could
proceed?.
unknown
speaker
your
point
is
that
that
is
a
question
you
need
not
answer
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
or,
and
that
we
need
not
answer
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
well
then
that
is
in
hobbs?
unknown
speaker
but
in
that
case,
i
understand
you
just
told
us
bad
faith
and
harassment
was
stipulated
not
to
exist.
in
the
present
case,
that
is
never
been
litigated.
unknown
speaker
no.
unknown
speaker
mr.
marky,
what
is
your
answer
to
your
brother’s
argument
that
he
did
alleged
harassment
and
bad
faith,
he
is
at
least
entitled
to
a
hearing
in
the
district
court
on
those
allegations.
unknown
speaker
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
that.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
you
are
arguing
that
2253
is
a
complete
bar
even
if
he
can
show
harassment
and
bad
faith
so
long
as
the
pending
state
proceeding
is
a
civil
proceeding,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
so
i
know
but
i
thought
the
--
unknown
speaker
younger
points
the
other
way,
does
it
not?
unknown
speaker
so,
i
suggest
that
it
points
the
other
way.
unknown
speaker
but
when
younger
points
this
court
decided
exactly
what
you
say
the
law
ought
to
be.
this
court,
in
this
case,
decided
this
case
just
the
way
you
say
it
should
have
decided
it.
so,
if
the
error
is
--
unknown
speaker
it
is
on
the
part
of
the
court
certainly
not
in
your
arguments.
you
are
simply
adopting
the
reasoning
of
the
district
court
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
wish
to
be
sure
that
did
not
have
the
benefit,
if
that
is
the
word,
of
our
opinions
in
younger
and
related
cases.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
smith,
if
we
should
decide
this
case
in
your
favor
on
the
inapplicability
in
this
case
for
some
reason
or
another,
if
section
2283
or
more
precisely
if
we
should
decide
either
the
2283
words
were
not
inapplicable
or
that
one
of
the
exceptions
therein
provided
were
applicable
--
applicable
this
one
in
2283.
then
what
you
are
telling
us
now
is
just
the
matter
that
you
would
then
be
permitted
to
present
to
the
district
court,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
because
that
is
never
been,
never
been
litigated
or
tried
or
even
considered
by
the
district
court,
by
the
three-judge
district
court
unknown
speaker
but
you
are
not,
for
there
is
no
point
if
you
are
arguing
those
things
to
us.
unknown
speaker
only,
except
to
you
say
that
it
is
--
it
was
in
your
complaint
and
you
brought
it
to
the
attention
of
the
district
court.
unknown
speaker
and
one
other
question
while
i
have
interrupted
you,
i
have
just
read
hobbs
against
thompson
and
so
far
as
one
and
read
all
this
trying
to
listen.
i
do
not
find
that
that
case
involved
any
application
of
2283,
did
it?
it
was
not
a
pending
state
proceeding
was
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
whatever
you
are
saying,
did
it
involve
a
pending
state
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
i
did
not
think
of
that.
unknown
speaker
right,
thank
you.
