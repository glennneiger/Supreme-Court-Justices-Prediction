mr.
raymond
l.
marky
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
position
of
the
appellees
before
the
court
is
that
a
three-judge
court
properly
concluded
that
the
anti-injunction
statute
was
an
absolute
bar
that
1983
was
not
an
expressed
exception
to
that
particular
provision
and
property
declined
to
grant
injunctive
relief.
the
question
that
is
not
before
the
court
is
whether
the
court
erred
and
perhaps,
declined
a
grant
declaratory
relief,
thus
we
do
not
have
the
dilemma
raised
in
the
sextet,
younger,
etcetera,
wherein
justice
brennan
i
believe
you
discussed
the
differences
that
may
exist
in
declaratory
relief.
so,
i
wish
to
make
it
clear,
subsequently
the
court
declined
to
grant
declaratory
relief.
but
that
has
not
been
raised
on
an
appeal
as
it
has
not
been
assigned
as
in
here
and
has
not
been
argued.
so,
i
will
not
address
myself
to
the
question
of
whether
they
should
have
perhaps
gone
on
and
granted
declaratory
relief
for
whatever
purpose
it
may
have
served.
the
only
reason
i
mentioned
that
is
i
know
that
there
is
a
question
on
the
court
as
to
whether
the
same
standards
were
always
applicable
to
a
declaratory
relief
as
opposed
to
injunctive
relief.
and
i
want
to
make
certain
that
that
is
not
an
issue
before
the
court.
yes
your
honor?
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
no
they
did
not
grant
declaratory
relief
your
honor.
they
concluded
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
i
do
not
know
what
the
answer
to
that
is
your
honor.
there
is
some
confusion
even
in
mr.
justice
black’s
majority
opinion
in
younger
as
to
whether
the
same
standards
applicable
are
always
applicable
in
declaratory
relief
that
are
in
injunctive
relief
situation.
so
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
yes
your
honor.
i
have
got
enough
confusion
about
that.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
correct.
the
position
of
the
appellees
is
that
atlantic
coast
line
is
absolutely
dispositive
of
the
issues
raised
herein
and
that
1983
is
not
an
exception
to
2283.
now,
i
have
cited
in
my
brief
several
cases
specifically
so
holding
and
we
are
relying
on
in
the
main
case
of
baines
versus
the
city
of
danville
out
of
the
fourth
circuit,
1963
wherein
that
court
made
a
lengthy
analysis
of
the
problems
that
would
be
created
in
this
situation,
the
confusion
and
the
disorder
over
one
--
a
federal
judge
attempting
to
get
into
the
bonafideness
with
a
lack
thereof
of
the
prosecutor
and
the
trial
judge
or
any
other
institutional
officers.
they
also
concluded
that
unlike
the
removal
statute
which
implicit
within
that
very
statute
itself
is
that
the
court
has
total
jurisdiction.
i
would
agree
that
by
necessary
corollary
that
when
they
remove
it
they
had
it
for
all
purpose
of
singularly.
there
is
no
such
antagonism
when
we
are
talking
about
1983
and
2283.
in
fact,
all
2283
is,
is
a
limitation
upon
the
chancellor’s
authority
to
engage
in
a
certain
limited
type
of
injunctive
relief,
although
he
may
occupy
a
general
grant
or
general
power
of
equity.
and
i
would
suggest
that
is
clearly
correct.
civil
rights
actions,
authorized
injunctions
against
university
presidents,
penal
institution
or
wardens,
all
sorts
of
people
wholly
and
completely
unrelated
to
the
criminal
state
prosecution
or
indeed
a
civil
prosecution,
and
i
--
in
that
context
i
would
note
that
while
there
has
been
some
suggestion
that
because
this
is
civil
case
we
have
a
problem.
but
mr.
justice
stewart,
in
footnote
3
of
your
concurring
opinion
noted
that
there
is
no
distinction
in
the
civil,
in
the
anti-injunction
statute
itself
as
a
civil
and
a
criminal
provision.
secondly,
i
thought
if
the
law
was
that
each
party
had
the
right
to
seek
out
its
own
forum,
and
i
would
be
a
guest
if
i
were
a
state
plaintiff,
suddenly
thrusting
a
federal
court
as
a
federal
defendant.
and
now
i,
having
to
fight
my
way
back
into
the
court
that
i
selected
first.
so
i
would
suggest
that
because
it
is
civil,
should
make
no
difference
as
to
the
application
of
the
anti-injunction
statute.
moreover,
the
state
in
fact
is
a
party
in
these
proceedings.
the
state
is
trying
to
implement
a
substantial
state
interest
that
they
have
and
that
is
expressed
in
the
penal
laws.
under
kingsley
books,
inc.
versus
new
york,
this
court
recognized
that
we
could
use
alternative
methods,
civil
and
criminal.
we
have
elected
to
attempt
the
civil.
in
this
context,
i
would
like
to
tell
the
court
that
i
am
fully
aware
of,
painfully
aware
of
i
might
add
in
light
of
the
florida
supreme
court’s
reversal
of
my
judgment
that
it
was
an
error.
i
would
agree
that
i
was
wrong
just
as
was
the
trial
judge
was
wrong
in
atlantic
coast
line
but
that
is
not
bad
faith.
many
of
us
make
mistakes,
i
frequently
do
and
i
think
i
would
probably
will
in
the
future.
indeed,
my
argument
right
here
maybe
a
mistake
and
yet
i
would
suggest
that
an
erroneous
initial
application
and
a
subsequent
declaration
that
i
was
wrong
cannot
retroactively
go
back
and
impute
into
me
a
bad
faith
on
my
effort
to
merely
auger
a
legal
position
that
may
or
may
not
prevail.
many
defendants
claim
the
rights
of
gideon
long
before
they
prevailed.
so
it
is
not
unusual
that
the
prosecutor
on
occasion
is
going
to
be
auguring
a
position
that
may
be
contrary
to
the
law.
but
i
think
that
is
the
way
the
law
gradually
is
effectuated
and
made
more
meaningful.
so,
for
these
reasons,
i
would
suggest
that
it
makes
no
difference
whether
it
is
civil
or
criminal.
going
back
to
baines
versus
city
of
danville,
i
find
it
very
interesting
that
in
hemsley
against
meyers,
an
1891
case,
involving
a
situation
not
unlike
this
where
the
defendant,
the
state
defendant
attempted
to
put
the
court
or
the
parties
in
a
squabble
more
or
less
to
divide
and
conquer
by
thrusting
the
state
into
a
federal
state
collision
to
get
this
worked
out.
in
the
meantime,
there
is
delay,
there
is
protraction,
there
is
confusion
and
no
one
is
properly
distributed.
that
judge
in
the
hemsley
case,
in
1891
concluded
that
it
would
just
be
chaos
to
allow
the
question
begging
that
goes
on
invariably
in
these
kind
of
lawsuits.
is
the
statute
constitutional?
is
there
bad
faith?
etcetera,
etcetera.
interestingly,
in
that
case,
judge
caldwell
completely
interpreted
720,
section
720,
the
predecessor
to
2283,
consistent
the
way
this
court
did
in
the
atlantic
coast
line
railroad
case,
that
it
is
an
absolute
bar
unless
you
can
fit
within
one
of
the
exceptions.
and
that
the
exception
which
then
did
not
exist,
the
civil
rights
act
was
not
an
exception
to
it
that
the
civil
rights
act
did
nothing
to
change
the
relationship
of
the
state
governments
and
the
federal
government
that
they
remained
reasonably
intact.
i
say
that
this
is
consistent
and
it
shows
the
history,
the
history
because
this
was
20
years
after
the
civil
rights
was
enacted.
that
at
that
time
the
framers
did
not
in
fact
intend
for
the
civil
rights
act
to
be
a
repeal
of
the
principles
recognized
in
atlantic
coast
line
which
are
embedded
in
the
tenth
amendment.
i
would
say
that
that
dispute
that
is
going
on
that
went
on
with
the
framers
that
mr.
justice
black
talked
about,
that
there
were
those
who
disagreed
as
to
whether
we
should
have
independent
federal
judiciary
to
determine
all
federal
questions.
i
say
that
that
debate
was
resolved
by
the
framers.
but
the
debate
rages
on.
and
debate
is
brought
to
this
tribunal,
is
actually
brought
to
this
tribunal.
and
i
would
urge
to
this
court
that
this
is
not
the
proper
place
to
bring
it.
the
reconsideration
or
the
reevaluation
of
the
policy
decision
made
200
years
ago
more
properly
rests
in
the
congress.
and
i
would
buttress
this
by
noting
that
this
court,
when
they
talked
of
the
removal
statutes
in
a
civil
rights
setting
not
in
a
“dirty
bookcase”
a
legitimate
civil
rights
action.
in
construing
the
civil
rights
act,
this
court
took
the
view
expressed
by
the
fourth
circuit
in,
again
baines
versus
city
of
danville,
another
case
but
related
to
the
removal
and
strictly
construed
that
and
said
that
statute
of
this
vintage
ought
not
be
loosely
construed
into
providing
the
relief
they
want
to
it
as
justice
holmes
noted
to
cut
red
tape
and
intervene.
so
i
would
suggest
that
this
court’s
interpretation
of
the
civil
rights
act
and
you
noted
in
there
the
absolute
chaos
that
would
result
in
this
respect,
the
appeal
of
the
removal
ruling,
perhaps
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
a
denial
of
cert
to
this
court
and
the
hearings
to
be
conducted
200
miles
away,
you
noted
that
a
year
and
a
half
later
after
all
the
legal
proceedings
were
over,
it
might
get
back
to
trial.
or
i
would
like
to
relate
this
aspect
to
the
case
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
that
merely
recognizes,
mr.
justice
douglas,
that
injunction
may
issue
and
say
a
suit
by
a
prisoner
against
the
warden.
if
there
was
no
equity
grant
there,
there
would
be
no
power
for
a
federal
courts,
for
example,
to
enjoin
the
warden
of
penal
institution
or
the
president
of
the
university.
so,
i
think
the
general
grant
of
equity
should
not
be
loosely
interpreted
to
meaning
that
2283
is
no
longer
applicable
because
atlantic
coast
line
says
we
must
not
loosely
construe
this
2283.
that
it
should
not
be
eroded.
the
proper
respect
for
state
and
federal
relation
should
not
be
intruded.
now,
i
am
merely
suggesting
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
your
honor,
there
was
none
mentioned
but
men
were
picketing
and
attempting
to
picket
in
a
very
public
way
by
which
to
attempt
to
redress
their
grievances
in
a
labor
dispute.
to
ignore
the
context,
your
honor,
what
i
am
saying
is
that
if
the
civil
rights
act
were
an
exception,
the
people
in
the
atlantic
coast
line,
although
they
could
not
have
gotten
in
under
norris-laguardia,
would
have
been
the
first
to
urge
you
your
honor,
civil
rights
act.
i
say
it
makes
the
anti-injunction
statute
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
no,
no.
i
say
if
you
construe
1983
to
be
an
exception,
who
will
need
norris-laguardia?
who
will
need
any
other
statute?
who
will
need
removal?
they
will
just
file
a
civil
rights
action
and
2283
becomes
meaningless.
in
fact,
this
is
exactly
what
the
court
held
in
baines
versus
the
city
of
danville.
they
said
if
we
--
we
open
it
up
this
as
loose
construction
we
avoid
the
reason
for
the
statute’s
existence.
so,
i
would
again
urge
that
when
you
look
at
it
in
this
respect,
it
just
will
not
work
your
honor.
counsel
has
alluded
to
machesky
versus
bizzell.
this
is
also
with
sheridan
versus
garrison.
the
fifth
circuit
did
not
say
1983
was
an
expressed
exception,
they
held
in
fact
that
they
could
grant
injunctive
relief
because
2283
was
a
rule
of
comity
not
an
absolute
bar.
but
that
was
repudiated
in
the
atlantic
coast
line
railroad
and
with
it
went
sheridan
and
machesky.
and
this,
if
it
please
the
court
is
why
judge
arnold
actually
receded
after
atlantic
coast
line
because
the
theory
under
which
he
was
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
your
honor,
again
that
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
that
issue
was
resolved
against
me
in
the
florida
supreme
court
and
i
could
see
that
it
was
an
erroneous
initial
application.
it
is
my
first
amendment
and
i
respected
the
same.
i
do
not
like
of
course
trampling
on
it.
but,
“when
are
they
trampling”.
in
other
words,
it
requires
a
close
examination
and
an
articulation
between
opposing
counsel.
before
we
can
understand
or
even
appreciate
that
there
has
in
fact
been
a
trampling
of
rights.
in
this
respect,
mr.
justice
douglas,
we
had
a
case
and
it
is
cited
in
both
sheridan
and
machesky,
it
is
called
dawkins
versus
green.
there,
it
was
a
civil
rights
case
allegedly
where
a
man
threw
a
molotov
cocktail
into
a
laundry
store.
they
filed
a
civil
rights
action
in
the
district
court
in
tallahassee,
i
handled
this
case.
they
claimed
that
it
violated
their
first
amendment
freedom
and
we
were
harassing
them.
we
went
--
we
had
--
the
court
granted
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
my
basis.
an
appeal
was
liaised
in
the
fifth
circuit.
the
fifth
circuit
reversed
and
set
to
hold
a
hearing.
by
the
time
we
got
to
the
hearing,
mr.
counselor
said
--
files
a
motion
to
voluntary
dismissal.
but
the
state
defendant
who
is
then
the
federal
plaintiff
was
gone
from
the
custody
of
the
state
of
florida.
it
was
18
months
later
and
we
were
gone.
now,
even
your
honor,
i
think
it
was
in
perez
versus
ledesma
or
in
dyson,
one
of
the
two,
said
well,
who
would
suggest
that
you
can
throw
rocks
and
bottles
in
the
name
of
speech.
yet,
mr.
dawkins
got
in
under
the
concept
of
dombrowski,
which
i
have
no
objection
to.
dombrowski,
that
man
could
not
have
vindicated
his
rights
in
any
state
proceeding.
the
obtaining
of
the
lists,
the
memberships
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
think
it
is
an
insult
to
compare.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
no.
i
agree
with
that
your
honor
but
only
when
a
court
gets
seated
and
starts
going
into
the
matters.
can
we
determine
whether
they
are
protected
or
not
protected?
i
mean
there
is
some
--
somehow,
we
got
to
start
a
proceeding
unless
this
court
recedes
from
roth,
and
united
states
against
riddle
and
those
cases.
unless
you
recede
from
that
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
the
state
is
attempting
to
enforce
a
legitimate
procedure.
let
me
put
it
in
this
context
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
his
salesmen
were
convicted.
their
conviction
was
affirmed
by
the
florida
supreme
court
and
no
appeal
was
launched
in
this
court
from
that
conviction.
the
books
that
counsel
has
described,
the
district
court
of
appeals
has
first
described
and
was
autofellatio
and
masturbation
was
one
of
the
books,
which
cannot
fit
within
any
case
ever
decided
by
this
court.
i
am
reasonably
confident
of
that
your
honor.
so,
i
do
not
want
to
get
into
any
inquiries
to
whether
the
books
were
obscene,
not
obscene
or
anything
else
because
i
think,
as
it
actually
happened
the
state
court
could
have
resolved
this
and
it
did
resolve
it.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
no
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
no.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
the
judge
concluded
that
the
store,
based
on
the
stipulation
or
the
representation
of
counsel,
that
all
of
the
books
that
were
being
sold
were
obscene.
and
since
all
of
the
books
that
were
being
obscene,
the
store
was
actually
operating
as
a
public
nuisance.
now,
that
judge
was
wrong
your
honor
as
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
yes
sir.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
no,
no.
that
is
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
that
is
not
what
i
am
trying
to
suggest
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
am
saying
that
many
times
a
civil
action
may
be
the
part
of
the
state's
machinery
for
enforcing
its
protected
area,
for
example
oil
spill
cases.
we
have
civil
injunctions
against
it,
with
fine
and
forfeiture
and
we
also
have
criminal
penalty.
so
the
state
in
many
times
uses
its
civil
remedies.
now,
i
could
not
help
but
note
the
counsel’s
reference
to
hobbs
versus
thompson
which
is
cited
to
this
is
court
in
448
f.
2d
just
decided
by
mr.
judge
goldberg
of
the
fifth
circuit.
they
did
say
a
lot
about
what
this
court
said
in
younger
but
the
negative
pregnant
of
younger,
it
must
be
qualified
by
what
you
do
here
today
in
this
case.
and
mr.
justice
stewart
noted
that,
i
believe
in
footnote
2
or
3
in
this
concurring
opinion
in
younger
versus
harris.
that
is
a
negative
pregnant.
do
not
decide
the
case
at
the
same
time
saying,
well,
we
would
not
answer
that
in
these
proceedings.
the
cases
here
are
not
to
be
decided.
but
in
the
hobbs
case,
they
used
that
negative
pregnant
to
actually
answer
the
question.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
yes
and
your
honor
what
--
at
page
466
of
the
hobbs
opinion
you
will
see
this,
i
would
like
to
just
read
it;
“in
the
instant
case,
we
are
not
even
faced
with
the
force
and
applicability
of
the
anti-injunction
act.
the
present
challenge
to
the
macon
ordinance
and
charter
provisions
not
only
is
outside
the
criminal
sphere
but
also
poses
no
possibility
of
interference
with
pending
state
proceedings.
the
present
challenge
simply
requests
relief
against
allegedly
unconstitutional
state
action
in
the
form
of
conditioning
and
employment
upon
the
surrender
of
political
activity.”
now,
that
is
nothing
but
baggett
v.
bullitt,
where
you
said
you
could
not
make
a
man
surrender
his
employment
in
lieu
of
signing
a
loyalty
oath.
so,
there
was
nothing
estranged
about
hobbs.
if
it
did
not
interfere
with
the
state
proceeding,
why
do
they
go
into
discussing
the
import
of
younger,
all
they
now
have
done
is
create
a
morass
and
i
read
it
out,
i
do
not
know
what
the
law
in
the
fifth
circuit
is
which
goes
to
the
point
that
i
guess
the
appellee
have
stated.
there
is
clear
authority
that
this
court
should
not
interpret
1983
as
an
expressed
exception.
why
should
you
not?
first
of
all,
the
practical
problems
mentioned
in
greenwood
versus
peacock
and
i
cite
these
in
the
brief.
just
like
in
the
jack
dawkins
case
that
i
alluded
to
early
this
morning,
200
miles
away,
18
months
later
and
we
do
not
have
a
defendant.
those
are
the
practical
problem.
moreover,
in
every
case
you
are
going
to
hold
a
hearing
to
determine
the
bonafideness
whereas
i
think
mr.
justice
brennan
noted
that
normally
you
should
be
able
to
look
at
the
pleadings
to
determine
who
first
filed
it
and
not
ought
to
be
end
of
it.
and
i
say
that
a
construction
that
i
auger
for,
avoids
the
necessity
of
these
hearings.
and
i
might
add
this,
every
time
your
honors,
every
time
a
hearing
is
held
and
it
is
denied
the
appellant
is
going
to
appeal.
i
mean,
the
plaintiff
is
going
to
appeal
if
it
is
denied.
if
it
is
granted,
i
tell
you
the
state
will
appeal
because
it
cannot
afford
to
have
an
order
in
the
books
declaring
its
officers
in
bad
faith.
consequently,
there
will
be
direct
appeals
to
this
court
from
every
civil
rights
case.
anyway,
i
think
the
court
could
take
judicial
knowledge
of
the
increase
in
civil
rights
actions
brought
before
this
court
under
1983
in
the
face
of
a
pending
state
proceeding.
another
reason
is
that
i
think
that
this,
a
construction
similar
to
mine
promotes
the
speedy,
orderly
dispensation
of
justice.
in
florida,
we
have
adopted
a
new
rule
guaranteeing
a
speedy
trial
within
60
days
or
an
immediate
release.
the
court
docket
is
not
an
excuse,
nothing.
if
the
man
is
not
tried
within
60
days
he
is
unconditionally
released.
all
this
will
do
is
delay
and
protract
the
legal
proceedings.
is
this
court’s
interpretation
as
they
suggest
necessary
to
the
enhancement
of
justice
and
the
promotion
of
liberty
in
this
country,
i
suggest
the
answer
is
in
the
negative.
the
fourth
circuit,
the
sixth
circuit,
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
second
circuit,
the
largest
circuits
in
the
united
states
had
held
that
is
an
absolute
bar
in
1983
is
not
an
expressed
exception.
i
would
ask
the
court,
if
those
jurisdictions
were
a
copy
maintained
because
it
is
an
absolute
bar,
which
means
they
do
not
get
a
hearing.
have
our
people
suffered
such
a
deprivation
of
their
liberty
that
had
has
posed
a
serious
threat
to
the
country.
i
would
suggest
the
answer
is
in
the
negative.
i
think
that
our
state
courts
are
in
trying
to
the
best
of
their
abilities
and
to
the
ability
that
god
gave
them
to
do
justice.
now,
occasionally
that
may
even
be
questioned.
but
on
those
rare
occasions
that
it
does
occur,
this
court
through
its
greater
jurisdiction
because
it
is
the
ultimate
arbitrar
of
all
actions
can
take
care
of
these
needs.
indeed,
that
is
where
i
brought
my
complaint
for
relief
in
the
mnw
theater’s
case
were
bad
faith
was
stipulated
not
to
exist
and
judge
arnold
enjoined.i
sought
a
stay
order
of
mr.
justice
black
granted
it.
it
is
now
pending
before
this
court
apparently
to
be
disposed
off
in
light
of
whatever
you
do
in
this
case.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
no,
all
i
am
--
what
i
am
saying
your
honor
is
that
we
--
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
so
much
wide
spread
deprivation
by
the
state
courts
and
that
is
what
we
are
talking
about.
you
are
seeing
the
state
judges
in
bad
faith.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
and
in
your
case,
dealing
with
removal
in
greenwood,
you
said
you
should
not
put
a
state
judge
on
trial.
the
embarrassment
between
the
state
judges
and
the
federal
judges
in
the
testimonies
and
the
appearances
before
each
other
in
this
case
would
bespeak
the
answer.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
when
we
think
that
it
will
--
when
we
know
that
a
construction
such
as
the
appellee
suggests
and
suggested
upon
the
court
makes
it
easier
for
trial
judges
below
to
dispose
of
whether
they
should
proceed
or
not
proceed
not
unlike
what
produced
gideon.
in
fact
in
gideon
versus
wainwright,
one
of
the
very
reasons
that
prompted
this
court
to
hold
as
they
did
was
that
it
would
avoid
the
necessity
of
having
to
make
an
independent
inquiry
over
and
over
as
to
whether
there
was
an
abuse
of
discretion.
i
say
that
a
ruling
favorable
as
rendered
below
will
have
precisely
the
same
effect
and
achievement.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
your
honor,
i
have
had
many
cases
where
it
was
alleged
that
there
was
harassment
and
none
was
shown.
and
finally
after
the
hearing
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
no.
i
understand
your
honor.
my
answer
to
that
is
that
the
--
in
the
jurisdictions
where
they
have
ruled
in
my
favor,
they
have
not
had
hearings
either
because
it
is
an
absolute
bar.
it
is
not
an
exception.
ergo,
these
people
have
not
been
granted
hearings
either.
and
i
say
under
atlantic
coast
line,
once
he
is
in
the
state
court,
he
is
suffering
an
adverse
ruling.
this
court
has
emergency
relief
to
rule
on
that
matter.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
or
a
criminal
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
that
--
but
--
at
any
event,
that
is
what
i
am
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
no,
younger
is
from
a
negative
pregnant
again
your
honor.
in
that
case
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
that
guess,
it
is
your
honor--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
that
is
correct.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
yes.
all
i
am
--
in
addition
to
the
avoidance
of
the
friction
that
it
--
that
i
need
not
even
go
into.
my
argument
is
consistent
with
acl
and
their
argument
flies
into
the
face
of
it.
so,
when
we
looked
at
the
totality
of
the
reasons
and
justifications
that
i
have
pointed
out
to
the
court,
the
benefits
to
be
the
simplicity
of
resolution,
the
avoidance
of
competence.
and
we
can
thrash
that
with
what
they
want,
disorder,
chaos,
fillet.
i
am
not
impeaching
their
integrity
or
the
morality.
all
i
am
saying
is
that
if
i
were
a
defense
lawyer
and
this
court
has
noted
in
stefanelli,
every
defense
lawyer
would
be
obliged
to
come
forward
and
raise
this
on
behalf
of
his
client.
that
is
the
only
benefit
that
will
come
from
such
a
ruling
and
i
respectfully
urge
this
court
to
affirm
the
action
taken
by
the
three-judges
in
the
case
of
law.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
position
of
the
appellees
before
the
court
is
that
a
three-judge
court
properly
concluded
that
the
anti-injunction
statute
was
an
absolute
bar
that
1983
was
not
an
expressed
exception
to
that
particular
provision
and
property
declined
to
grant
injunctive
relief.
the
question
that
is
not
before
the
court
is
whether
the
court
erred
and
perhaps,
declined
a
grant
declaratory
relief,
thus
we
do
not
have
the
dilemma
raised
in
the
sextet,
younger,
etcetera,
wherein
justice
brennan
i
believe
you
discussed
the
differences
that
may
exist
in
declaratory
relief.
so,
i
wish
to
make
it
clear,
subsequently
the
court
declined
to
grant
declaratory
relief.
but
that
has
not
been
raised
on
an
appeal
as
it
has
not
been
assigned
as
in
here
and
has
not
been
argued.
so,
i
will
not
address
myself
to
the
question
of
whether
they
should
have
perhaps
gone
on
and
granted
declaratory
relief
for
whatever
purpose
it
may
have
served.
the
only
reason
i
mentioned
that
is
i
know
that
there
is
a
question
on
the
court
as
to
whether
the
same
standards
were
always
applicable
to
a
declaratory
relief
as
opposed
to
injunctive
relief.
and
i
want
to
make
certain
that
that
is
not
an
issue
before
the
court.
yes
your
honor?
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
no
they
did
not
grant
declaratory
relief
your
honor.
they
concluded
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
i
do
not
know
what
the
answer
to
that
is
your
honor.
there
is
some
confusion
even
in
mr.
justice
black’s
majority
opinion
in
younger
as
to
whether
the
same
standards
applicable
are
always
applicable
in
declaratory
relief
that
are
in
injunctive
relief
situation.
so
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
yes
your
honor.
i
have
got
enough
confusion
about
that.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
correct.
the
position
of
the
appellees
is
that
atlantic
coast
line
is
absolutely
dispositive
of
the
issues
raised
herein
and
that
1983
is
not
an
exception
to
2283.
now,
i
have
cited
in
my
brief
several
cases
specifically
so
holding
and
we
are
relying
on
in
the
main
case
of
baines
versus
the
city
of
danville
out
of
the
fourth
circuit,
1963
wherein
that
court
made
a
lengthy
analysis
of
the
problems
that
would
be
created
in
this
situation,
the
confusion
and
the
disorder
over
one
--
a
federal
judge
attempting
to
get
into
the
bonafideness
with
a
lack
thereof
of
the
prosecutor
and
the
trial
judge
or
any
other
institutional
officers.
they
also
concluded
that
unlike
the
removal
statute
which
implicit
within
that
very
statute
itself
is
that
the
court
has
total
jurisdiction.
i
would
agree
that
by
necessary
corollary
that
when
they
remove
it
they
had
it
for
all
purpose
of
singularly.
there
is
no
such
antagonism
when
we
are
talking
about
1983
and
2283.
in
fact,
all
2283
is,
is
a
limitation
upon
the
chancellor’s
authority
to
engage
in
a
certain
limited
type
of
injunctive
relief,
although
he
may
occupy
a
general
grant
or
general
power
of
equity.
and
i
would
suggest
that
is
clearly
correct.
civil
rights
actions,
authorized
injunctions
against
university
presidents,
penal
institution
or
wardens,
all
sorts
of
people
wholly
and
completely
unrelated
to
the
criminal
state
prosecution
or
indeed
a
civil
prosecution,
and
i
--
in
that
context
i
would
note
that
while
there
has
been
some
suggestion
that
because
this
is
civil
case
we
have
a
problem.
but
mr.
justice
stewart,
in
footnote
3
of
your
concurring
opinion
noted
that
there
is
no
distinction
in
the
civil,
in
the
anti-injunction
statute
itself
as
a
civil
and
a
criminal
provision.
secondly,
i
thought
if
the
law
was
that
each
party
had
the
right
to
seek
out
its
own
forum,
and
i
would
be
a
guest
if
i
were
a
state
plaintiff,
suddenly
thrusting
a
federal
court
as
a
federal
defendant.
and
now
i,
having
to
fight
my
way
back
into
the
court
that
i
selected
first.
so
i
would
suggest
that
because
it
is
civil,
should
make
no
difference
as
to
the
application
of
the
anti-injunction
statute.
moreover,
the
state
in
fact
is
a
party
in
these
proceedings.
the
state
is
trying
to
implement
a
substantial
state
interest
that
they
have
and
that
is
expressed
in
the
penal
laws.
under
kingsley
books,
inc.
versus
new
york,
this
court
recognized
that
we
could
use
alternative
methods,
civil
and
criminal.
we
have
elected
to
attempt
the
civil.
in
this
context,
i
would
like
to
tell
the
court
that
i
am
fully
aware
of,
painfully
aware
of
i
might
add
in
light
of
the
florida
supreme
court’s
reversal
of
my
judgment
that
it
was
an
error.
i
would
agree
that
i
was
wrong
just
as
was
the
trial
judge
was
wrong
in
atlantic
coast
line
but
that
is
not
bad
faith.
many
of
us
make
mistakes,
i
frequently
do
and
i
think
i
would
probably
will
in
the
future.
indeed,
my
argument
right
here
maybe
a
mistake
and
yet
i
would
suggest
that
an
erroneous
initial
application
and
a
subsequent
declaration
that
i
was
wrong
cannot
retroactively
go
back
and
impute
into
me
a
bad
faith
on
my
effort
to
merely
auger
a
legal
position
that
may
or
may
not
prevail.
many
defendants
claim
the
rights
of
gideon
long
before
they
prevailed.
so
it
is
not
unusual
that
the
prosecutor
on
occasion
is
going
to
be
auguring
a
position
that
may
be
contrary
to
the
law.
but
i
think
that
is
the
way
the
law
gradually
is
effectuated
and
made
more
meaningful.
so,
for
these
reasons,
i
would
suggest
that
it
makes
no
difference
whether
it
is
civil
or
criminal.
going
back
to
baines
versus
city
of
danville,
i
find
it
very
interesting
that
in
hemsley
against
meyers,
an
1891
case,
involving
a
situation
not
unlike
this
where
the
defendant,
the
state
defendant
attempted
to
put
the
court
or
the
parties
in
a
squabble
more
or
less
to
divide
and
conquer
by
thrusting
the
state
into
a
federal
state
collision
to
get
this
worked
out.
in
the
meantime,
there
is
delay,
there
is
protraction,
there
is
confusion
and
no
one
is
properly
distributed.
that
judge
in
the
hemsley
case,
in
1891
concluded
that
it
would
just
be
chaos
to
allow
the
question
begging
that
goes
on
invariably
in
these
kind
of
lawsuits.
is
the
statute
constitutional?
is
there
bad
faith?
etcetera,
etcetera.
interestingly,
in
that
case,
judge
caldwell
completely
interpreted
720,
section
720,
the
predecessor
to
2283,
consistent
the
way
this
court
did
in
the
atlantic
coast
line
railroad
case,
that
it
is
an
absolute
bar
unless
you
can
fit
within
one
of
the
exceptions.
and
that
the
exception
which
then
did
not
exist,
the
civil
rights
act
was
not
an
exception
to
it
that
the
civil
rights
act
did
nothing
to
change
the
relationship
of
the
state
governments
and
the
federal
government
that
they
remained
reasonably
intact.
i
say
that
this
is
consistent
and
it
shows
the
history,
the
history
because
this
was
20
years
after
the
civil
rights
was
enacted.
that
at
that
time
the
framers
did
not
in
fact
intend
for
the
civil
rights
act
to
be
a
repeal
of
the
principles
recognized
in
atlantic
coast
line
which
are
embedded
in
the
tenth
amendment.
i
would
say
that
that
dispute
that
is
going
on
that
went
on
with
the
framers
that
mr.
justice
black
talked
about,
that
there
were
those
who
disagreed
as
to
whether
we
should
have
independent
federal
judiciary
to
determine
all
federal
questions.
i
say
that
that
debate
was
resolved
by
the
framers.
but
the
debate
rages
on.
and
debate
is
brought
to
this
tribunal,
is
actually
brought
to
this
tribunal.
and
i
would
urge
to
this
court
that
this
is
not
the
proper
place
to
bring
it.
the
reconsideration
or
the
reevaluation
of
the
policy
decision
made
200
years
ago
more
properly
rests
in
the
congress.
and
i
would
buttress
this
by
noting
that
this
court,
when
they
talked
of
the
removal
statutes
in
a
civil
rights
setting
not
in
a
“dirty
bookcase”
a
legitimate
civil
rights
action.
in
construing
the
civil
rights
act,
this
court
took
the
view
expressed
by
the
fourth
circuit
in,
again
baines
versus
city
of
danville,
another
case
but
related
to
the
removal
and
strictly
construed
that
and
said
that
statute
of
this
vintage
ought
not
be
loosely
construed
into
providing
the
relief
they
want
to
it
as
justice
holmes
noted
to
cut
red
tape
and
intervene.
so
i
would
suggest
that
this
court’s
interpretation
of
the
civil
rights
act
and
you
noted
in
there
the
absolute
chaos
that
would
result
in
this
respect,
the
appeal
of
the
removal
ruling,
perhaps
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
a
denial
of
cert
to
this
court
and
the
hearings
to
be
conducted
200
miles
away,
you
noted
that
a
year
and
a
half
later
after
all
the
legal
proceedings
were
over,
it
might
get
back
to
trial.
or
i
would
like
to
relate
this
aspect
to
the
case
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
that
merely
recognizes,
mr.
justice
douglas,
that
injunction
may
issue
and
say
a
suit
by
a
prisoner
against
the
warden.
if
there
was
no
equity
grant
there,
there
would
be
no
power
for
a
federal
courts,
for
example,
to
enjoin
the
warden
of
penal
institution
or
the
president
of
the
university.
so,
i
think
the
general
grant
of
equity
should
not
be
loosely
interpreted
to
meaning
that
2283
is
no
longer
applicable
because
atlantic
coast
line
says
we
must
not
loosely
construe
this
2283.
that
it
should
not
be
eroded.
the
proper
respect
for
state
and
federal
relation
should
not
be
intruded.
now,
i
am
merely
suggesting
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
your
honor,
there
was
none
mentioned
but
men
were
picketing
and
attempting
to
picket
in
a
very
public
way
by
which
to
attempt
to
redress
their
grievances
in
a
labor
dispute.
to
ignore
the
context,
your
honor,
what
i
am
saying
is
that
if
the
civil
rights
act
were
an
exception,
the
people
in
the
atlantic
coast
line,
although
they
could
not
have
gotten
in
under
norris-laguardia,
would
have
been
the
first
to
urge
you
your
honor,
civil
rights
act.
i
say
it
makes
the
anti-injunction
statute
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
no,
no.
i
say
if
you
construe
1983
to
be
an
exception,
who
will
need
norris-laguardia?
who
will
need
any
other
statute?
who
will
need
removal?
they
will
just
file
a
civil
rights
action
and
2283
becomes
meaningless.
in
fact,
this
is
exactly
what
the
court
held
in
baines
versus
the
city
of
danville.
they
said
if
we
--
we
open
it
up
this
as
loose
construction
we
avoid
the
reason
for
the
statute’s
existence.
so,
i
would
again
urge
that
when
you
look
at
it
in
this
respect,
it
just
will
not
work
your
honor.
counsel
has
alluded
to
machesky
versus
bizzell.
this
is
also
with
sheridan
versus
garrison.
the
fifth
circuit
did
not
say
1983
was
an
expressed
exception,
they
held
in
fact
that
they
could
grant
injunctive
relief
because
2283
was
a
rule
of
comity
not
an
absolute
bar.
but
that
was
repudiated
in
the
atlantic
coast
line
railroad
and
with
it
went
sheridan
and
machesky.
and
this,
if
it
please
the
court
is
why
judge
arnold
actually
receded
after
atlantic
coast
line
because
the
theory
under
which
he
was
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
your
honor,
again
that
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
that
issue
was
resolved
against
me
in
the
florida
supreme
court
and
i
could
see
that
it
was
an
erroneous
initial
application.
it
is
my
first
amendment
and
i
respected
the
same.
i
do
not
like
of
course
trampling
on
it.
but,
“when
are
they
trampling”.
in
other
words,
it
requires
a
close
examination
and
an
articulation
between
opposing
counsel.
before
we
can
understand
or
even
appreciate
that
there
has
in
fact
been
a
trampling
of
rights.
in
this
respect,
mr.
justice
douglas,
we
had
a
case
and
it
is
cited
in
both
sheridan
and
machesky,
it
is
called
dawkins
versus
green.
there,
it
was
a
civil
rights
case
allegedly
where
a
man
threw
a
molotov
cocktail
into
a
laundry
store.
they
filed
a
civil
rights
action
in
the
district
court
in
tallahassee,
i
handled
this
case.
they
claimed
that
it
violated
their
first
amendment
freedom
and
we
were
harassing
them.
we
went
--
we
had
--
the
court
granted
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
my
basis.
an
appeal
was
liaised
in
the
fifth
circuit.
the
fifth
circuit
reversed
and
set
to
hold
a
hearing.
by
the
time
we
got
to
the
hearing,
mr.
counselor
said
--
files
a
motion
to
voluntary
dismissal.
but
the
state
defendant
who
is
then
the
federal
plaintiff
was
gone
from
the
custody
of
the
state
of
florida.
it
was
18
months
later
and
we
were
gone.
now,
even
your
honor,
i
think
it
was
in
perez
versus
ledesma
or
in
dyson,
one
of
the
two,
said
well,
who
would
suggest
that
you
can
throw
rocks
and
bottles
in
the
name
of
speech.
yet,
mr.
dawkins
got
in
under
the
concept
of
dombrowski,
which
i
have
no
objection
to.
dombrowski,
that
man
could
not
have
vindicated
his
rights
in
any
state
proceeding.
the
obtaining
of
the
lists,
the
memberships
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
think
it
is
an
insult
to
compare.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
no.
i
agree
with
that
your
honor
but
only
when
a
court
gets
seated
and
starts
going
into
the
matters.
can
we
determine
whether
they
are
protected
or
not
protected?
i
mean
there
is
some
--
somehow,
we
got
to
start
a
proceeding
unless
this
court
recedes
from
roth,
and
united
states
against
riddle
and
those
cases.
unless
you
recede
from
that
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
the
state
is
attempting
to
enforce
a
legitimate
procedure.
let
me
put
it
in
this
context
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
his
salesmen
were
convicted.
their
conviction
was
affirmed
by
the
florida
supreme
court
and
no
appeal
was
launched
in
this
court
from
that
conviction.
the
books
that
counsel
has
described,
the
district
court
of
appeals
has
first
described
and
was
autofellatio
and
masturbation
was
one
of
the
books,
which
cannot
fit
within
any
case
ever
decided
by
this
court.
i
am
reasonably
confident
of
that
your
honor.
so,
i
do
not
want
to
get
into
any
inquiries
to
whether
the
books
were
obscene,
not
obscene
or
anything
else
because
i
think,
as
it
actually
happened
the
state
court
could
have
resolved
this
and
it
did
resolve
it.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
no
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
no.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
the
judge
concluded
that
the
store,
based
on
the
stipulation
or
the
representation
of
counsel,
that
all
of
the
books
that
were
being
sold
were
obscene.
and
since
all
of
the
books
that
were
being
obscene,
the
store
was
actually
operating
as
a
public
nuisance.
now,
that
judge
was
wrong
your
honor
as
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
yes
sir.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
no,
no.
that
is
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
that
is
not
what
i
am
trying
to
suggest
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
am
saying
that
many
times
a
civil
action
may
be
the
part
of
the
state's
machinery
for
enforcing
its
protected
area,
for
example
oil
spill
cases.
we
have
civil
injunctions
against
it,
with
fine
and
forfeiture
and
we
also
have
criminal
penalty.
so
the
state
in
many
times
uses
its
civil
remedies.
now,
i
could
not
help
but
note
the
counsel’s
reference
to
hobbs
versus
thompson
which
is
cited
to
this
is
court
in
448
f.
2d
just
decided
by
mr.
judge
goldberg
of
the
fifth
circuit.
they
did
say
a
lot
about
what
this
court
said
in
younger
but
the
negative
pregnant
of
younger,
it
must
be
qualified
by
what
you
do
here
today
in
this
case.
and
mr.
justice
stewart
noted
that,
i
believe
in
footnote
2
or
3
in
this
concurring
opinion
in
younger
versus
harris.
that
is
a
negative
pregnant.
do
not
decide
the
case
at
the
same
time
saying,
well,
we
would
not
answer
that
in
these
proceedings.
the
cases
here
are
not
to
be
decided.
but
in
the
hobbs
case,
they
used
that
negative
pregnant
to
actually
answer
the
question.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
yes
and
your
honor
what
--
at
page
466
of
the
hobbs
opinion
you
will
see
this,
i
would
like
to
just
read
it;
“in
the
instant
case,
we
are
not
even
faced
with
the
force
and
applicability
of
the
anti-injunction
act.
the
present
challenge
to
the
macon
ordinance
and
charter
provisions
not
only
is
outside
the
criminal
sphere
but
also
poses
no
possibility
of
interference
with
pending
state
proceedings.
the
present
challenge
simply
requests
relief
against
allegedly
unconstitutional
state
action
in
the
form
of
conditioning
and
employment
upon
the
surrender
of
political
activity.”
now,
that
is
nothing
but
baggett
v.
bullitt,
where
you
said
you
could
not
make
a
man
surrender
his
employment
in
lieu
of
signing
a
loyalty
oath.
so,
there
was
nothing
estranged
about
hobbs.
if
it
did
not
interfere
with
the
state
proceeding,
why
do
they
go
into
discussing
the
import
of
younger,
all
they
now
have
done
is
create
a
morass
and
i
read
it
out,
i
do
not
know
what
the
law
in
the
fifth
circuit
is
which
goes
to
the
point
that
i
guess
the
appellee
have
stated.
there
is
clear
authority
that
this
court
should
not
interpret
1983
as
an
expressed
exception.
why
should
you
not?
first
of
all,
the
practical
problems
mentioned
in
greenwood
versus
peacock
and
i
cite
these
in
the
brief.
just
like
in
the
jack
dawkins
case
that
i
alluded
to
early
this
morning,
200
miles
away,
18
months
later
and
we
do
not
have
a
defendant.
those
are
the
practical
problem.
moreover,
in
every
case
you
are
going
to
hold
a
hearing
to
determine
the
bonafideness
whereas
i
think
mr.
justice
brennan
noted
that
normally
you
should
be
able
to
look
at
the
pleadings
to
determine
who
first
filed
it
and
not
ought
to
be
end
of
it.
and
i
say
that
a
construction
that
i
auger
for,
avoids
the
necessity
of
these
hearings.
and
i
might
add
this,
every
time
your
honors,
every
time
a
hearing
is
held
and
it
is
denied
the
appellant
is
going
to
appeal.
i
mean,
the
plaintiff
is
going
to
appeal
if
it
is
denied.
if
it
is
granted,
i
tell
you
the
state
will
appeal
because
it
cannot
afford
to
have
an
order
in
the
books
declaring
its
officers
in
bad
faith.
consequently,
there
will
be
direct
appeals
to
this
court
from
every
civil
rights
case.
anyway,
i
think
the
court
could
take
judicial
knowledge
of
the
increase
in
civil
rights
actions
brought
before
this
court
under
1983
in
the
face
of
a
pending
state
proceeding.
another
reason
is
that
i
think
that
this,
a
construction
similar
to
mine
promotes
the
speedy,
orderly
dispensation
of
justice.
in
florida,
we
have
adopted
a
new
rule
guaranteeing
a
speedy
trial
within
60
days
or
an
immediate
release.
the
court
docket
is
not
an
excuse,
nothing.
if
the
man
is
not
tried
within
60
days
he
is
unconditionally
released.
all
this
will
do
is
delay
and
protract
the
legal
proceedings.
is
this
court’s
interpretation
as
they
suggest
necessary
to
the
enhancement
of
justice
and
the
promotion
of
liberty
in
this
country,
i
suggest
the
answer
is
in
the
negative.
the
fourth
circuit,
the
sixth
circuit,
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
second
circuit,
the
largest
circuits
in
the
united
states
had
held
that
is
an
absolute
bar
in
1983
is
not
an
expressed
exception.
i
would
ask
the
court,
if
those
jurisdictions
were
a
copy
maintained
because
it
is
an
absolute
bar,
which
means
they
do
not
get
a
hearing.
have
our
people
suffered
such
a
deprivation
of
their
liberty
that
had
has
posed
a
serious
threat
to
the
country.
i
would
suggest
the
answer
is
in
the
negative.
i
think
that
our
state
courts
are
in
trying
to
the
best
of
their
abilities
and
to
the
ability
that
god
gave
them
to
do
justice.
now,
occasionally
that
may
even
be
questioned.
but
on
those
rare
occasions
that
it
does
occur,
this
court
through
its
greater
jurisdiction
because
it
is
the
ultimate
arbitrar
of
all
actions
can
take
care
of
these
needs.
indeed,
that
is
where
i
brought
my
complaint
for
relief
in
the
mnw
theater’s
case
were
bad
faith
was
stipulated
not
to
exist
and
judge
arnold
enjoined.i
sought
a
stay
order
of
mr.
justice
black
granted
it.
it
is
now
pending
before
this
court
apparently
to
be
disposed
off
in
light
of
whatever
you
do
in
this
case.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
no,
all
i
am
--
what
i
am
saying
your
honor
is
that
we
--
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
so
much
wide
spread
deprivation
by
the
state
courts
and
that
is
what
we
are
talking
about.
you
are
seeing
the
state
judges
in
bad
faith.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
and
in
your
case,
dealing
with
removal
in
greenwood,
you
said
you
should
not
put
a
state
judge
on
trial.
the
embarrassment
between
the
state
judges
and
the
federal
judges
in
the
testimonies
and
the
appearances
before
each
other
in
this
case
would
bespeak
the
answer.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
when
we
think
that
it
will
--
when
we
know
that
a
construction
such
as
the
appellee
suggests
and
suggested
upon
the
court
makes
it
easier
for
trial
judges
below
to
dispose
of
whether
they
should
proceed
or
not
proceed
not
unlike
what
produced
gideon.
in
fact
in
gideon
versus
wainwright,
one
of
the
very
reasons
that
prompted
this
court
to
hold
as
they
did
was
that
it
would
avoid
the
necessity
of
having
to
make
an
independent
inquiry
over
and
over
as
to
whether
there
was
an
abuse
of
discretion.
i
say
that
a
ruling
favorable
as
rendered
below
will
have
precisely
the
same
effect
and
achievement.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
your
honor,
i
have
had
many
cases
where
it
was
alleged
that
there
was
harassment
and
none
was
shown.
and
finally
after
the
hearing
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
no.
i
understand
your
honor.
my
answer
to
that
is
that
the
--
in
the
jurisdictions
where
they
have
ruled
in
my
favor,
they
have
not
had
hearings
either
because
it
is
an
absolute
bar.
it
is
not
an
exception.
ergo,
these
people
have
not
been
granted
hearings
either.
and
i
say
under
atlantic
coast
line,
once
he
is
in
the
state
court,
he
is
suffering
an
adverse
ruling.
this
court
has
emergency
relief
to
rule
on
that
matter.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
or
a
criminal
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
that
--
but
--
at
any
event,
that
is
what
i
am
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
no,
younger
is
from
a
negative
pregnant
again
your
honor.
in
that
case
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
that
guess,
it
is
your
honor--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
that
is
correct.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
yes.
all
i
am
--
in
addition
to
the
avoidance
of
the
friction
that
it
--
that
i
need
not
even
go
into.
my
argument
is
consistent
with
acl
and
their
argument
flies
into
the
face
of
it.
so,
when
we
looked
at
the
totality
of
the
reasons
and
justifications
that
i
have
pointed
out
to
the
court,
the
benefits
to
be
the
simplicity
of
resolution,
the
avoidance
of
competence.
and
we
can
thrash
that
with
what
they
want,
disorder,
chaos,
fillet.
i
am
not
impeaching
their
integrity
or
the
morality.
all
i
am
saying
is
that
if
i
were
a
defense
lawyer
and
this
court
has
noted
in
stefanelli,
every
defense
lawyer
would
be
obliged
to
come
forward
and
raise
this
on
behalf
of
his
client.
that
is
the
only
benefit
that
will
come
from
such
a
ruling
and
i
respectfully
urge
this
court
to
affirm
the
action
taken
by
the
three-judges
in
the
case
of
law.
thank
you
very
much.
