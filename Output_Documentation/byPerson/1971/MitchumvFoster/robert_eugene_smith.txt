mr.
robert
eugene
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
case
arose
in
the
state
of
florida
in
a
town
called
panama
city
in
which
a
state
court
judge
granted
a
closing
requested
by
the
prosecution
of
an
adult
bookstore
selling
adult
materials.
and
so,
identified
--
this
was
predicated
after
a
hearing
in
which
the
trial
judge
looked
at
certain
few
publications
and
felt
that
if
these
were
representative,
this
whole
store
should
be
closed.
it
was
injunctive
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
this
is
not
a
store
that
was
selling
time
and
life.
consistent
with
what
some
counsel
view,
the
decisions
of
this
court
since
redrup
it
was
an
adult
bookstore
which
was
identified
as
an
adult
bookstore
and,
you
know,
you
must
be
21
to
enter.
so
that
no
one
would
enter
and
be
intruded
upon
by
their
privacy
looking
to
buy
a
ladies’
home
journal
or
something
of
this
nature.
so
we
are
dealing
with
only
adult
merchandise
and
the
concession
or
any
representation
that
all
the
material
was
adult
only
oriented.
whether
it
be
pocket
novel,
whether
it
be
girly
magazines,
these
were
all
adult
only
oriented
material.
that
was
the
way
to
view
to
the
judge,
we
suggest
looked
at
the
entire
thing
and
that
is
what
i
mean
by
the
term
representative,
adult
only
versus
reportorial
or
newspapers
or
things
of
that
nature
sir.
and
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no
sir.
it
was
not
contended
that
it
was
--
they
said
they
were
representative
of
the
material
and
all
the
material
was
adult
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
well,
maybe
not
explicitly,
it
suggested
or
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
erotic
materials,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
it
was
for
adults
only,
erotic
type
materials.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
combination
sir.
mostly
pocket
novels
but
a
lot
of
girly
type
magazines,
primarily
girly
type
magazines
or
either
also
some
cover
girl
and
exciting
which
it
were
involved
in
bloss
versus
dykema
that
had
been
held
by
this
court
by
a
4:3
decision
that
seemingly
to
be
protected
and
these
same
publications
were
in
that
particular
store.
thereafter
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
it
did
not
involve
articles
or
clothing.
it
was
strictly
an
adult
bookstore.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
and
thereafter,
an
injunction
was
sought,
temporary
restraining
order
was
sought.
complaint
was
filed
asking
for
a
three-judge
court.
judge
arnow
granted
a
temporary
restraining
order
after
hearing
--
first
having
found
the
dombrowski
versus
pfister
circumstances
were
present,
irreparable
harm--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
and
now,
i
gather
they
have
other
alternatives
besides
criminal
prosecution
or
perhaps
or
are
they
(inaudible)
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
this
was
not
a
criminal
prosecution
your
honor.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
a
nuisance.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
your
honor,
in
this
particular
case,
a
criminal
procedure
had
predated
the
civil
procedure.
they
have
taken
some
of
the
publications
which
were
the
subject
of
a
pending
criminal
case
and
utilized
those
in
the
civil
procedure
that
followed
thereafter.
the
injunctive
relief
sought
was
as
to
the
closing
of
the
entire
store.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
that
is
my
understanding,
yes
sir.
the
temporary
restraining
order
was
issued
by
judge
arnow.
thereafter,
judge
arnow
issues
another
temporary
restraining
order
continuing
it
pending
a
hearing
on
a
three-judge
court
because
the
trial
judge
wanted
to
cite
the
petitioner
for
contempt
because
he
had
offered
something
for
sale
after
the
federal
district
court
had
said
that
the
injunctive
order
was
not
proper
or
at
least
was
staid
pending
the
three-judge
court
hearing
nevertheless,
ultimately
we
got
to
the
question
of
the
three-judge
court.
and
after
the
three-judge
court
had
convened,
this
court
decided
the
atlantic
coast
rail
lines
case
and
that
seemed
to
close
it
as
far
as
the
three-judge
court
was
concerned
below.
they
vacated
all
injunctions
that
were
pending
and
they
denied
the
injunctive
relief
sought
below
based
a
set
up
on
the
anti-injunction
law
as
interpreting
it
from
the
atlantic
coast
rail
lines
case.
this
we
suggest
now
is
a
civil
proceeding.
this
is
not
criminal,
single
criminal
proceeding
as
we
had
in
some
of
the
other
cases
that
this
court
cited.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir,
it
was
not
integrated.
it
was
a
separate
proceeding
and
the
judge’s
order
was
to
close
the
entire
business
and
to
not
remove
from
the
premises
any
of
the
publications
that
were
there.
and
ultimately,
thereafter
he
issued
an
order
allowing
the
publications
on
the
premises
to
be
seized
and
we
have
set
out
the
list
of
the
publications
that
were
seized
in
the
appendix
most
of
which
were
in
the
handwriting,
i
think
of
the
sheriff
and
his
deputies
and
it
is
in
a
--
it
is
a
rather
substantial
compendium
beginning
on
page
198
of
volume
1
of
the
appendix
in
this
case
and
continuing
through
to
the
end
almost
to
page
251.
so,
these
were
the
publications
which
were
seized
by
virtue
of
the
court
order
after
the
closing.
now
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no
sir,
they
have
not
been
destroyed.
they
have
been
returned
since
that
time
as
a
result
of
other
activity
that
occurred
in
the
judicial
system
in
the
state
of
florida.
in
another
case
which
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
has
called
to
the
attention
of
this
court
and
i
believe
he
has
placed
it
in
the
back
of
his
briefs
called
mitchum
versus
shabb
(ph).
the
florida
supreme
court
when
considering
the
issue,
a
comparable
issue,
decided
that
the
judge
below
had
been
a
little
too
ambitious
in
his
rulings
and
reversed
based
on
the
concept
of
near
versus
minnesota.
and
this
was
july
9,
1971
after
this
court
had
noted
probable
jurisdiction
in
the
mitchum
versus
foster
case.
and
the
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
separate
proceeding
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir
and
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
and
i
were
counsel.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no
sir.
the
same
type
of
material
but
not
a
--
a
different
geographical
infusion.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
sir,
we
went
to
a
different
court.
we
went
to
an
appellate
court
and
it
is
working
its
way
up
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
it
is
working
its
way
up
at
the
present
time
i
gathered.
except
this
is
what
has
occurred,
your
honor.
the
court,
the
intermediate
court
of
appeals
treated
it.
in
florida,
if
a
constitutional
question
was
presented,
the
state
in
this
particular
case
in
mitchum
versus
shabb
(ph)
moved
to
transfer
the
matter
because
of
its
importance
as
a
constitutional
issue
out
of
the
district
court
of
appeals
and
into
the
supreme
court.
while
the
other
case
ended
up
in
the
district
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court
of
appeals
affirmed
judge
fitzpatrick’s
order
below
and
said
that
the
--
whatever
occurred
in
this
case
was
proper
and
judge
fitzpatrick
was
not
wrong
just
as
late
as
29th
of
november
1971.
in
anticipation
we
suggest
that
this
case
being
heard
today,
as
judge
fitzpatrick
entered
a
final
order
and
said
in
essence
that
he
had
been
overbroad
in
his
interpretation
and
he
was
now
cutting
back
and
limiting
the
effect
of
his
order.
november
29,
1971,
i
will
leave
a
copy
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
to
the
publication
to
which
were
before
him.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no
sir,
to
the
publication,
to
several
named
publications
which
were
before
him.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
the
store
is
now
out
of
business.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
it
remained
close
for
a
substantial
period
of
time,
yes
sir.
pending,
going
for
the
appellate
route.
so,
again,
went
to
a
district
court
of
appeals
which
affirmed
judge
fitzpatrick’s
orders.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
we
would
have
gone
had
it
not
been
for
the
entry
of
this
order.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
pardon?
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes.
november
29,
1971.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
we
have
a
petition
for
rehearing
pending
in
that
particular
case
and
what
is
left
with
the
order,
in
essence
your
honor,
is
that
no
longer
do
we
have
a
nuisance
law
closing
which
says
that
the
entire
store
is
closed.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
your
honor
it
is
questionable
in
all
candor
based
upon
what
happened
on
november
29,
1971.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
it
is
questionable
based
upon
what
happened
on
november
29,
1971.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
that
would
be
correct.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
closing
the
entire
business,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
what
part
--
pardon
sir?
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
this
is
a
brand
--
this
just
came
down
sir.
i
just
got
it.
i
think
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir,
i
would
leave
it
here.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes.
unfortunately
i
just
got
this
on
friday
from
local
counsel
that
--
of
course
it
was
not
mr.
raymond
l.
marky’s
fault
but
--
we
had
argued
and
said
that
the
law
in
florida
is
unconstitutional.
we
raised
a
facial
attack
upon
the
constitutionality
of
the
law
as
it
is
fairly
obscenity
law.
meyer.
v.
austin
is
a
case
which
has
been
pending
in
this
court
for
some
13-14
months
in
which
two
of
the
three-judge
court
in
jacksonville
declared
the
florida
obscenity
law
to
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
in
the
case
below,
we
raised
many
issues
regarding
the
constitutionality
of
the
law
including
its
facial
and
its
application.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
we
sought
damages
as
well.
we
said
the
irreparable
injury
at
the
time
we
instituted
suit
was
the
order
of
the
court
closing
the
entire
store.
the
three-judge
court
said
we
do
not
reach
any
of
your
issues
because
under
atlantic
coast
rail
lines
case
you
are
now
--
we
are
now
foreclosed
from
acting
under
the
civil
rights
act.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
with
him
abstaining
based
on
atlantic
coast
rail
lines
case?
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
well,
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
we
want
to
go
back
to
the
three-judge
court
and
have
our
full
hearing
on
the
merits
involving
the
obscenity
law
in
general
as
we
have
attacked
it
and
not
just
what
has
occurred
here.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
we
raised
the
facial
attack
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
it
was
a
raised
before
judge
fitzpatrick.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir,
raising
and
preserving,
of
course
is
england
versus
england
medical
examiner
or
the
louisiana
medical
examiners
requires
us
to.
so,
this
is
where
i
come
having
to
argue
the
case
as
we
suggest
predicated
upon
what
has
occurred
on
november
29th.
we
suggest
that
if
we
are
permitted
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes.
it
was
a
civil
proceeding
underway.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
but
there
is
some
language
which
suggests
that
we
should
say
something
and
as
was
done
in
this
case.
we
are
asking
for
the
right
to
have
the
--
to
say
that
the
2283
does
not
act
as
a
bar
to
injunctive
relief
when
a
proper
case
is
made
out.
and
we
say
that
at
the
time
we
made
our
proper
case,
we
do
not
think
circumstances
have
been
rendered
moot,
we
would
like
to
have
a
chance
to
have
the
court
consider
the
other
constitutional
arguments
regarding
the
statute
which
were
raised
at
that
time
and
to
seek
prospective
criminal
injunctive
relief
from
cases
which
are
not
now
pending.
the
history
of
the
anti-injunction
statute
is
a
correspondent
that
starts
back
in
the
early
days
in
1870
--
1773
when
the
first
act
was
passed
by
the
congress,
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
first
act
may
have
been
limited
only
to
the
justices
of
this
court.
however,
80
years
later,
this
court
considered
that
was
not
so
and
held
it
applicable
to
all
of
the
courts.
there
were
subsequent
amendments
that
occurred
particularly
after
the
1941
toucey
case
in
which
the
certain
exemption
that
exists
in
the
law
was
stricken
out
and
thereafter,
the
exemptions
stricken
out
was
the
question
of
the
re-litigation
of
issues
already
decided
by
the
court.
and
justice
frankfurter
seemed
to
suggest
in
this
toucey
case
that
the
exceptions
of
the
anti-injunction
action
could
be
inferred
from
other
federal
legislation
and
it
did
not
have
to
expressly
say
so.
after
the
--
justice
reed
in
dissenting
over
this
case
felt
there
should
be
a
certain
flexibility
supplied
by
judicial
interpretation
and
it
seemingly
in
1948
when
this
was
re-codified,
that
was
the
partial
prospect
involved.
in
the
leiter
minerals
case,
the
court
said
that
the
anti-injunction
statute
did
not
apply
to
the
united
states
and
so
it
was
perfectly
--
it
was
could
be
an
exception
in
that
regard
seemingly
as
a
issue
of
a
policy.
this
court
decided
in
1955
the
amalgamated
clothing
workers
versus
richmond
brothers
case
which
mr.
justice
frankfurter
again
spoke
for
the
court
and
in
essence
mr.
justice
frankfurter
suggested
that
this
court
could
not
whittle
away
the
intent
of
congress
in
the
anti-injunction
act.
in
1970,
when
the
atlantic
coast
rail
lines
case
came
down,
a
decision
said
that
a
federal
injunction
could
not
be
obtained
unless
--
because
of
the
anti-injunction
statute.
that
was
not
a
civil
rights
case
and
so,
we
say
that
there
would
be
some
exception
to
it.
there
had
been
many
decisions
throughout
the
country.
there
is
an
amicus
brief
that
has
been
filed
here
from
third
circuit
relating
to
certain
judgments
of
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals.
there
are
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
judgments
and
three-judge
court
judgments
and
throughout
the
fifth
circuit
which
are
of
wide
ranging.
there
is
a
new
one
out
by
judge
goldberg
cited
hobbs
versus
thompson,
this
is
a
brand
new,
it
has
just
been
reported
in
the
advance
and
sheets
448
federal
2nd
456
in
which
judge
goldberg
undertakes
to
explain
what
this
court
meant
in
younger
versus
harris
and
the
other
cases.
but
it
seems
we
suggest
that
the
anti-injunction
statute
gives
way
when
we
are
dealing
with
private
--
public
rights
versus
private
rights
because
we
think
that
that
seems
to
be
implicit
in
the
leiter
minerals
company
case
and
we
say
that
when
there
are
public
rights
because
of
the
need
to
protect
and
preserve
the
public
rights,
that
the
anti-injunction
statute
could
be
considered
not
to
be
applicable.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
2283.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
oh,
yes.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
it
is
different.
no
sir,
i
am
not
saying
that.
we
of
course
have
argued
that
in
our
brief
but
aside
from
that
we
think
there
are
essentially
three
grounds,
one
is
an
exception
and
in
this
context,
the
argument
i
am
taking
out
is
not
necessarily
exception
but
that
--
as
a
matter
of
policy
when
seemingly
private
versus
public
rights
are
involved
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no
sir.
it
just
--
there
is
an
anti-injunction
statute,
leiter
minerals
versus
u.s.,
this
court
said
it
was
not
meant
to
apply
to
the
united
states
government.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
because
the
united
states
government
was
protecting
public
rights.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
we
said
rights
of
the
people,
eternal
rights
of
people.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
public
rights.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
it
--
well,
private
versus
public
rights.
judge
griffin
bell
of
the
fifth
circuit
writing
in
machesky
versus
bizzell
which
is
mentioned
in
our
brief,
talks
about
the
difference
between
the
two
categories
and
suggests
that
as
a
matter
of
comity
that
when
public
rights
are
involved,
the
anti-injunction
statute
is
here
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
here
is
the
right
of
the
public,
the
first
amendment
right,
that
showing
of
speech,
the
right
to
be
able
to
use
and
close
up
an
entire
business
entity
which
is
offering
at
least
presumptively
protected
first
amendment
materials
and
we
say
that
this
is
the
right
--
mr.
justice
brennan
writing
in
--
for
instance,
quantity
books
versus
kansas,
this
court
pointed
out
that
the
public
in
essence
would
only
be
able
to
have
access
to
publications
which
had
been
the
subject
to
seizure
dependent
upon
the
right
of
the
distributor
to
get
additional
copies
which
themselves
would
be
subject
to
seizure.
and
that
it
was
the
public,
seemingly
the
public’s
right
to
have
access
to
non-obscene
materials
which
could
be
involved.
so,
we
are
talking
throughout
here
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
we
are
talking
about
the
interest
of
the
adult
public,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir,
because
there
is
no
question
of
minors.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
there
is
no
question
of
minors
involved
here
at
all.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
case
as
it
was
your
honor.
case
as
it
was
in
all
candor.
we
say
that
in
dombrowski
versus
pfister,
the
distinction
of
saying
that
if
you
win
the
race
to
the
courthouse
door,
it
is
alright
and
you
can
stay
in
the
federal
court
versus
saying
if
they
win
the
race
to
the
courthouse
door
and
file
in
the
state
court,
you
do
not
have
that
right.
we
say
it
is
rather
artificial
that
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
but
we
say
that
the
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
the
conflict
between
federalism
and
the
state
court
rights
to
proceed
is
the
same
because
if
immediately
after
a
federal
court
enters
--
has
a
suit
entered
in
the
state
court
proceeding
is
undertaken
there
still
becomes
a
possible
conflict
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
it
would
seem
that
that
would
be
the
original
purpose,
yes
sir.
except
when
there
is
unusual
circumstances
to
this
court
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir,
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no
sir.
but
it
is
first,
certain,
special
certain
circumstances
seem
to
be
present
and
if
they
were
present,
there
would
be
a
justification
we
suggest
for
federal
court
to
intervene.
it
makes
it
clear
that
there
is
this
certain
type
of
harassment.
if
there
is
the
irreparable
harm
that
is
involved
then
i
would
say
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
but
it
--
it
is.
but
if
in
the
younger
line
of
cases
this
court
has
said
that
bad
faith
and
harassment
maybe
the
type
of
situation
which
would
allow
an
injunction
to
proceed
then
is
it
not
saying
that
2283
is
not
an
absolute
bar
to
the
position?
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
well,
there
of
course
is
a
conflict
as
to
whether
it
did
or
did
not.
atlantic
coast
rail
lines
case
seems
to
say
no.
as
read
literally
your
honor,
it
seems
to
say
that
there
that
nothing
is
an
exception
so
to
speak,
unless
those
things
were
specifically
pulled
up.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
well,
then
that
is
what
--
that
is
where
it
comes
back
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
that
is
where
–
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
it
qualifies
as
a
prosecution,
yes,
it
is
a
prosecution.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
but
then
in
that
court
is
reaching
that
rationale,
i
would
suggest
by
then
saying
that
the
2283
is
not
applicable
in
that
kind
of
case.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
i
know
that.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir,
and
we
say
that
those
type
of
unusual
circumstances
were
presented
when
this
case
first
was
presented
to
the
court
down
below
and
those
were
the
complete
closing
of
the
business
entity
on
the
basis
that
--
without
any
question
as
to
what
would
occur
in
the
future,
it
was
a
total
complete
prior
restrain
in
operating
that
business
activity
and
at
that
time
the
case
was
presented.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
in
stages--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
on
november
29th
1971.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
books
were
given
back
earlier
but
when
--
in
regard
to
allowing
the
store
to
open
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no
sir,
let
us
get
back
in
the
state
court
and
have
our
hearing
on
whether
there
is
other
evidence
of
that.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir,
i
am
sorry
three-judge
federal
court.
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
not
as
we
have
presented
in
here,
no
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
but
of
course
that
was
criminal,
this
was
civil.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
which
we
suggest
a
very
excellent
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir,
i
am
aware
of
that.
as
i
have
pointed
out
to
the
court
there
is
an
excellent
analysis
bites
of
what
you
all
meant
in
younger
and
harris
and
hobbs
versus
thompson
decided
by
judge
goldberg
in
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no
sir,
it
has
just
been
reported,
448
f.
2nd
456.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
thank
you.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir,
but
the
district
court
judge,
judge
harlan
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
no
way
consider
that
because
it
was
absolutely
barred
by
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir
and
that
is
correct.
that
is
why
we
have
ask
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
that
is
facially
raised
in
the
pleadings.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
a
few
very
brief
things,
mr.
judge
fitzpatrick
in
the
6th
day
of
april
1970
reentered
his
preliminary
order,
held
that
the
activities
of
the
defendant
in
panama
city
were
prima
facie
injurious
and
damaging
to
the
morals
and
manners
to
the
people
of
the
state
of
florida
were
prima
facie
subversive
to
public
order
and
decency
and
prima
facie
constituted
to
public
noise
and
nuisance.
and
that
the
plaintiff
had
demonstrated
irreparable
harm
and
damage,
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
being
a
state
to
the
morals
and
welfare
and
safety
of
the
people
of
state
of
florida.
there
was
no
evidence
before
that
court
of
any
kind
in
that
regard
and
the
court
ordered
there
further,
hereby,
enjoins
from
operating
and
maintaining
any
business
on
the
premises.
and
are
further
enjoined
from
removing
anything
from
the
premises.
and
thereafter,
an
immediate
request
was
made
were
superceduous.
staid
the
effect
of
the
order
your
honor
so
we
can
appeal.
no,
we
would
not
do
so.
immediate
request
for
superceduous
was
made
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
they
denied
the
same
and
by
order
denied
the
same
and
said
that
they
could
not
say
that
the
judge
below
was
in
error
and
denied
us
the
relief.
we
had
to
await
our
appellate
relief
there.
thereafter,
a
federal
suit
was
filed.
and
although,
judge
fitzpatrick
said,
the
defendants
can
have
an
expeditious
hearing
time
and
time
again,
defense
counsel
filed
a
request
for
an
expeditious
hearing
and
it
was
denied.
it
was
for
this
reason
that
the
federal
court
intervention
was
sought
because
we
felt
that
the
whole
circumstances
were
and
the
irreparable
harm
was
present.
we
wanted
to
prove
our
bad
faith.
we
felt
the
use
of
a
nuisance
law
and
the
way
it
was
used
in
this
case
was
erroneous
and
we
felt
we
would
like
to
have
the
right
and
we
would
like
to
have
the
right
to
go
back
to
a
district
court
and
so
demonstrate
that
to
the
court.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
that
is
why
i
say
that
we
would
want
the
right
to
go
back.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
all
i
said
sir,
was
--
that
it
was
a
good
discussion
of
what
this
court
had
said
in
younger
and
a
good
discussion
on
this
issue.
i
was
not
saying
that
it
was
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
it
is
just
a
good
discussion.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
case
arose
in
the
state
of
florida
in
a
town
called
panama
city
in
which
a
state
court
judge
granted
a
closing
requested
by
the
prosecution
of
an
adult
bookstore
selling
adult
materials.
and
so,
identified
--
this
was
predicated
after
a
hearing
in
which
the
trial
judge
looked
at
certain
few
publications
and
felt
that
if
these
were
representative,
this
whole
store
should
be
closed.
it
was
injunctive
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
this
is
not
a
store
that
was
selling
time
and
life.
consistent
with
what
some
counsel
view,
the
decisions
of
this
court
since
redrup
it
was
an
adult
bookstore
which
was
identified
as
an
adult
bookstore
and,
you
know,
you
must
be
21
to
enter.
so
that
no
one
would
enter
and
be
intruded
upon
by
their
privacy
looking
to
buy
a
ladies’
home
journal
or
something
of
this
nature.
so
we
are
dealing
with
only
adult
merchandise
and
the
concession
or
any
representation
that
all
the
material
was
adult
only
oriented.
whether
it
be
pocket
novel,
whether
it
be
girly
magazines,
these
were
all
adult
only
oriented
material.
that
was
the
way
to
view
to
the
judge,
we
suggest
looked
at
the
entire
thing
and
that
is
what
i
mean
by
the
term
representative,
adult
only
versus
reportorial
or
newspapers
or
things
of
that
nature
sir.
and
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no
sir.
it
was
not
contended
that
it
was
--
they
said
they
were
representative
of
the
material
and
all
the
material
was
adult
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
well,
maybe
not
explicitly,
it
suggested
or
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
erotic
materials,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
it
was
for
adults
only,
erotic
type
materials.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
combination
sir.
mostly
pocket
novels
but
a
lot
of
girly
type
magazines,
primarily
girly
type
magazines
or
either
also
some
cover
girl
and
exciting
which
it
were
involved
in
bloss
versus
dykema
that
had
been
held
by
this
court
by
a
4:3
decision
that
seemingly
to
be
protected
and
these
same
publications
were
in
that
particular
store.
thereafter
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
it
did
not
involve
articles
or
clothing.
it
was
strictly
an
adult
bookstore.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
and
thereafter,
an
injunction
was
sought,
temporary
restraining
order
was
sought.
complaint
was
filed
asking
for
a
three-judge
court.
judge
arnow
granted
a
temporary
restraining
order
after
hearing
--
first
having
found
the
dombrowski
versus
pfister
circumstances
were
present,
irreparable
harm--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
and
now,
i
gather
they
have
other
alternatives
besides
criminal
prosecution
or
perhaps
or
are
they
(inaudible)
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
this
was
not
a
criminal
prosecution
your
honor.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
a
nuisance.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
your
honor,
in
this
particular
case,
a
criminal
procedure
had
predated
the
civil
procedure.
they
have
taken
some
of
the
publications
which
were
the
subject
of
a
pending
criminal
case
and
utilized
those
in
the
civil
procedure
that
followed
thereafter.
the
injunctive
relief
sought
was
as
to
the
closing
of
the
entire
store.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
that
is
my
understanding,
yes
sir.
the
temporary
restraining
order
was
issued
by
judge
arnow.
thereafter,
judge
arnow
issues
another
temporary
restraining
order
continuing
it
pending
a
hearing
on
a
three-judge
court
because
the
trial
judge
wanted
to
cite
the
petitioner
for
contempt
because
he
had
offered
something
for
sale
after
the
federal
district
court
had
said
that
the
injunctive
order
was
not
proper
or
at
least
was
staid
pending
the
three-judge
court
hearing
nevertheless,
ultimately
we
got
to
the
question
of
the
three-judge
court.
and
after
the
three-judge
court
had
convened,
this
court
decided
the
atlantic
coast
rail
lines
case
and
that
seemed
to
close
it
as
far
as
the
three-judge
court
was
concerned
below.
they
vacated
all
injunctions
that
were
pending
and
they
denied
the
injunctive
relief
sought
below
based
a
set
up
on
the
anti-injunction
law
as
interpreting
it
from
the
atlantic
coast
rail
lines
case.
this
we
suggest
now
is
a
civil
proceeding.
this
is
not
criminal,
single
criminal
proceeding
as
we
had
in
some
of
the
other
cases
that
this
court
cited.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir,
it
was
not
integrated.
it
was
a
separate
proceeding
and
the
judge’s
order
was
to
close
the
entire
business
and
to
not
remove
from
the
premises
any
of
the
publications
that
were
there.
and
ultimately,
thereafter
he
issued
an
order
allowing
the
publications
on
the
premises
to
be
seized
and
we
have
set
out
the
list
of
the
publications
that
were
seized
in
the
appendix
most
of
which
were
in
the
handwriting,
i
think
of
the
sheriff
and
his
deputies
and
it
is
in
a
--
it
is
a
rather
substantial
compendium
beginning
on
page
198
of
volume
1
of
the
appendix
in
this
case
and
continuing
through
to
the
end
almost
to
page
251.
so,
these
were
the
publications
which
were
seized
by
virtue
of
the
court
order
after
the
closing.
now
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no
sir,
they
have
not
been
destroyed.
they
have
been
returned
since
that
time
as
a
result
of
other
activity
that
occurred
in
the
judicial
system
in
the
state
of
florida.
in
another
case
which
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
has
called
to
the
attention
of
this
court
and
i
believe
he
has
placed
it
in
the
back
of
his
briefs
called
mitchum
versus
shabb
(ph).
the
florida
supreme
court
when
considering
the
issue,
a
comparable
issue,
decided
that
the
judge
below
had
been
a
little
too
ambitious
in
his
rulings
and
reversed
based
on
the
concept
of
near
versus
minnesota.
and
this
was
july
9,
1971
after
this
court
had
noted
probable
jurisdiction
in
the
mitchum
versus
foster
case.
and
the
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
separate
proceeding
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir
and
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
and
i
were
counsel.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no
sir.
the
same
type
of
material
but
not
a
--
a
different
geographical
infusion.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
sir,
we
went
to
a
different
court.
we
went
to
an
appellate
court
and
it
is
working
its
way
up
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
it
is
working
its
way
up
at
the
present
time
i
gathered.
except
this
is
what
has
occurred,
your
honor.
the
court,
the
intermediate
court
of
appeals
treated
it.
in
florida,
if
a
constitutional
question
was
presented,
the
state
in
this
particular
case
in
mitchum
versus
shabb
(ph)
moved
to
transfer
the
matter
because
of
its
importance
as
a
constitutional
issue
out
of
the
district
court
of
appeals
and
into
the
supreme
court.
while
the
other
case
ended
up
in
the
district
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court
of
appeals
affirmed
judge
fitzpatrick’s
order
below
and
said
that
the
--
whatever
occurred
in
this
case
was
proper
and
judge
fitzpatrick
was
not
wrong
just
as
late
as
29th
of
november
1971.
in
anticipation
we
suggest
that
this
case
being
heard
today,
as
judge
fitzpatrick
entered
a
final
order
and
said
in
essence
that
he
had
been
overbroad
in
his
interpretation
and
he
was
now
cutting
back
and
limiting
the
effect
of
his
order.
november
29,
1971,
i
will
leave
a
copy
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
to
the
publication
to
which
were
before
him.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no
sir,
to
the
publication,
to
several
named
publications
which
were
before
him.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
the
store
is
now
out
of
business.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
it
remained
close
for
a
substantial
period
of
time,
yes
sir.
pending,
going
for
the
appellate
route.
so,
again,
went
to
a
district
court
of
appeals
which
affirmed
judge
fitzpatrick’s
orders.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
we
would
have
gone
had
it
not
been
for
the
entry
of
this
order.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
pardon?
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes.
november
29,
1971.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
we
have
a
petition
for
rehearing
pending
in
that
particular
case
and
what
is
left
with
the
order,
in
essence
your
honor,
is
that
no
longer
do
we
have
a
nuisance
law
closing
which
says
that
the
entire
store
is
closed.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
your
honor
it
is
questionable
in
all
candor
based
upon
what
happened
on
november
29,
1971.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
it
is
questionable
based
upon
what
happened
on
november
29,
1971.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
that
would
be
correct.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
closing
the
entire
business,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
what
part
--
pardon
sir?
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
this
is
a
brand
--
this
just
came
down
sir.
i
just
got
it.
i
think
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir,
i
would
leave
it
here.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes.
unfortunately
i
just
got
this
on
friday
from
local
counsel
that
--
of
course
it
was
not
mr.
raymond
l.
marky’s
fault
but
--
we
had
argued
and
said
that
the
law
in
florida
is
unconstitutional.
we
raised
a
facial
attack
upon
the
constitutionality
of
the
law
as
it
is
fairly
obscenity
law.
meyer.
v.
austin
is
a
case
which
has
been
pending
in
this
court
for
some
13-14
months
in
which
two
of
the
three-judge
court
in
jacksonville
declared
the
florida
obscenity
law
to
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
in
the
case
below,
we
raised
many
issues
regarding
the
constitutionality
of
the
law
including
its
facial
and
its
application.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
we
sought
damages
as
well.
we
said
the
irreparable
injury
at
the
time
we
instituted
suit
was
the
order
of
the
court
closing
the
entire
store.
the
three-judge
court
said
we
do
not
reach
any
of
your
issues
because
under
atlantic
coast
rail
lines
case
you
are
now
--
we
are
now
foreclosed
from
acting
under
the
civil
rights
act.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
with
him
abstaining
based
on
atlantic
coast
rail
lines
case?
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
well,
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
we
want
to
go
back
to
the
three-judge
court
and
have
our
full
hearing
on
the
merits
involving
the
obscenity
law
in
general
as
we
have
attacked
it
and
not
just
what
has
occurred
here.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
we
raised
the
facial
attack
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
it
was
a
raised
before
judge
fitzpatrick.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir,
raising
and
preserving,
of
course
is
england
versus
england
medical
examiner
or
the
louisiana
medical
examiners
requires
us
to.
so,
this
is
where
i
come
having
to
argue
the
case
as
we
suggest
predicated
upon
what
has
occurred
on
november
29th.
we
suggest
that
if
we
are
permitted
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes.
it
was
a
civil
proceeding
underway.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
but
there
is
some
language
which
suggests
that
we
should
say
something
and
as
was
done
in
this
case.
we
are
asking
for
the
right
to
have
the
--
to
say
that
the
2283
does
not
act
as
a
bar
to
injunctive
relief
when
a
proper
case
is
made
out.
and
we
say
that
at
the
time
we
made
our
proper
case,
we
do
not
think
circumstances
have
been
rendered
moot,
we
would
like
to
have
a
chance
to
have
the
court
consider
the
other
constitutional
arguments
regarding
the
statute
which
were
raised
at
that
time
and
to
seek
prospective
criminal
injunctive
relief
from
cases
which
are
not
now
pending.
the
history
of
the
anti-injunction
statute
is
a
correspondent
that
starts
back
in
the
early
days
in
1870
--
1773
when
the
first
act
was
passed
by
the
congress,
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
first
act
may
have
been
limited
only
to
the
justices
of
this
court.
however,
80
years
later,
this
court
considered
that
was
not
so
and
held
it
applicable
to
all
of
the
courts.
there
were
subsequent
amendments
that
occurred
particularly
after
the
1941
toucey
case
in
which
the
certain
exemption
that
exists
in
the
law
was
stricken
out
and
thereafter,
the
exemptions
stricken
out
was
the
question
of
the
re-litigation
of
issues
already
decided
by
the
court.
and
justice
frankfurter
seemed
to
suggest
in
this
toucey
case
that
the
exceptions
of
the
anti-injunction
action
could
be
inferred
from
other
federal
legislation
and
it
did
not
have
to
expressly
say
so.
after
the
--
justice
reed
in
dissenting
over
this
case
felt
there
should
be
a
certain
flexibility
supplied
by
judicial
interpretation
and
it
seemingly
in
1948
when
this
was
re-codified,
that
was
the
partial
prospect
involved.
in
the
leiter
minerals
case,
the
court
said
that
the
anti-injunction
statute
did
not
apply
to
the
united
states
and
so
it
was
perfectly
--
it
was
could
be
an
exception
in
that
regard
seemingly
as
a
issue
of
a
policy.
this
court
decided
in
1955
the
amalgamated
clothing
workers
versus
richmond
brothers
case
which
mr.
justice
frankfurter
again
spoke
for
the
court
and
in
essence
mr.
justice
frankfurter
suggested
that
this
court
could
not
whittle
away
the
intent
of
congress
in
the
anti-injunction
act.
in
1970,
when
the
atlantic
coast
rail
lines
case
came
down,
a
decision
said
that
a
federal
injunction
could
not
be
obtained
unless
--
because
of
the
anti-injunction
statute.
that
was
not
a
civil
rights
case
and
so,
we
say
that
there
would
be
some
exception
to
it.
there
had
been
many
decisions
throughout
the
country.
there
is
an
amicus
brief
that
has
been
filed
here
from
third
circuit
relating
to
certain
judgments
of
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals.
there
are
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
judgments
and
three-judge
court
judgments
and
throughout
the
fifth
circuit
which
are
of
wide
ranging.
there
is
a
new
one
out
by
judge
goldberg
cited
hobbs
versus
thompson,
this
is
a
brand
new,
it
has
just
been
reported
in
the
advance
and
sheets
448
federal
2nd
456
in
which
judge
goldberg
undertakes
to
explain
what
this
court
meant
in
younger
versus
harris
and
the
other
cases.
but
it
seems
we
suggest
that
the
anti-injunction
statute
gives
way
when
we
are
dealing
with
private
--
public
rights
versus
private
rights
because
we
think
that
that
seems
to
be
implicit
in
the
leiter
minerals
company
case
and
we
say
that
when
there
are
public
rights
because
of
the
need
to
protect
and
preserve
the
public
rights,
that
the
anti-injunction
statute
could
be
considered
not
to
be
applicable.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
2283.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
oh,
yes.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
it
is
different.
no
sir,
i
am
not
saying
that.
we
of
course
have
argued
that
in
our
brief
but
aside
from
that
we
think
there
are
essentially
three
grounds,
one
is
an
exception
and
in
this
context,
the
argument
i
am
taking
out
is
not
necessarily
exception
but
that
--
as
a
matter
of
policy
when
seemingly
private
versus
public
rights
are
involved
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no
sir.
it
just
--
there
is
an
anti-injunction
statute,
leiter
minerals
versus
u.s.,
this
court
said
it
was
not
meant
to
apply
to
the
united
states
government.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
because
the
united
states
government
was
protecting
public
rights.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
we
said
rights
of
the
people,
eternal
rights
of
people.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
public
rights.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
it
--
well,
private
versus
public
rights.
judge
griffin
bell
of
the
fifth
circuit
writing
in
machesky
versus
bizzell
which
is
mentioned
in
our
brief,
talks
about
the
difference
between
the
two
categories
and
suggests
that
as
a
matter
of
comity
that
when
public
rights
are
involved,
the
anti-injunction
statute
is
here
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
here
is
the
right
of
the
public,
the
first
amendment
right,
that
showing
of
speech,
the
right
to
be
able
to
use
and
close
up
an
entire
business
entity
which
is
offering
at
least
presumptively
protected
first
amendment
materials
and
we
say
that
this
is
the
right
--
mr.
justice
brennan
writing
in
--
for
instance,
quantity
books
versus
kansas,
this
court
pointed
out
that
the
public
in
essence
would
only
be
able
to
have
access
to
publications
which
had
been
the
subject
to
seizure
dependent
upon
the
right
of
the
distributor
to
get
additional
copies
which
themselves
would
be
subject
to
seizure.
and
that
it
was
the
public,
seemingly
the
public’s
right
to
have
access
to
non-obscene
materials
which
could
be
involved.
so,
we
are
talking
throughout
here
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
we
are
talking
about
the
interest
of
the
adult
public,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir,
because
there
is
no
question
of
minors.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
there
is
no
question
of
minors
involved
here
at
all.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
case
as
it
was
your
honor.
case
as
it
was
in
all
candor.
we
say
that
in
dombrowski
versus
pfister,
the
distinction
of
saying
that
if
you
win
the
race
to
the
courthouse
door,
it
is
alright
and
you
can
stay
in
the
federal
court
versus
saying
if
they
win
the
race
to
the
courthouse
door
and
file
in
the
state
court,
you
do
not
have
that
right.
we
say
it
is
rather
artificial
that
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
but
we
say
that
the
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
the
conflict
between
federalism
and
the
state
court
rights
to
proceed
is
the
same
because
if
immediately
after
a
federal
court
enters
--
has
a
suit
entered
in
the
state
court
proceeding
is
undertaken
there
still
becomes
a
possible
conflict
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
it
would
seem
that
that
would
be
the
original
purpose,
yes
sir.
except
when
there
is
unusual
circumstances
to
this
court
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir,
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no
sir.
but
it
is
first,
certain,
special
certain
circumstances
seem
to
be
present
and
if
they
were
present,
there
would
be
a
justification
we
suggest
for
federal
court
to
intervene.
it
makes
it
clear
that
there
is
this
certain
type
of
harassment.
if
there
is
the
irreparable
harm
that
is
involved
then
i
would
say
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
but
it
--
it
is.
but
if
in
the
younger
line
of
cases
this
court
has
said
that
bad
faith
and
harassment
maybe
the
type
of
situation
which
would
allow
an
injunction
to
proceed
then
is
it
not
saying
that
2283
is
not
an
absolute
bar
to
the
position?
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
well,
there
of
course
is
a
conflict
as
to
whether
it
did
or
did
not.
atlantic
coast
rail
lines
case
seems
to
say
no.
as
read
literally
your
honor,
it
seems
to
say
that
there
that
nothing
is
an
exception
so
to
speak,
unless
those
things
were
specifically
pulled
up.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
well,
then
that
is
what
--
that
is
where
it
comes
back
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
that
is
where
–
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
it
qualifies
as
a
prosecution,
yes,
it
is
a
prosecution.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
but
then
in
that
court
is
reaching
that
rationale,
i
would
suggest
by
then
saying
that
the
2283
is
not
applicable
in
that
kind
of
case.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
i
know
that.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir,
and
we
say
that
those
type
of
unusual
circumstances
were
presented
when
this
case
first
was
presented
to
the
court
down
below
and
those
were
the
complete
closing
of
the
business
entity
on
the
basis
that
--
without
any
question
as
to
what
would
occur
in
the
future,
it
was
a
total
complete
prior
restrain
in
operating
that
business
activity
and
at
that
time
the
case
was
presented.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
in
stages--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
on
november
29th
1971.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
books
were
given
back
earlier
but
when
--
in
regard
to
allowing
the
store
to
open
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no
sir,
let
us
get
back
in
the
state
court
and
have
our
hearing
on
whether
there
is
other
evidence
of
that.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir,
i
am
sorry
three-judge
federal
court.
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
not
as
we
have
presented
in
here,
no
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
but
of
course
that
was
criminal,
this
was
civil.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
which
we
suggest
a
very
excellent
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir,
i
am
aware
of
that.
as
i
have
pointed
out
to
the
court
there
is
an
excellent
analysis
bites
of
what
you
all
meant
in
younger
and
harris
and
hobbs
versus
thompson
decided
by
judge
goldberg
in
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no
sir,
it
has
just
been
reported,
448
f.
2nd
456.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
thank
you.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir,
but
the
district
court
judge,
judge
harlan
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
no
way
consider
that
because
it
was
absolutely
barred
by
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir
and
that
is
correct.
that
is
why
we
have
ask
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
that
is
facially
raised
in
the
pleadings.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
a
few
very
brief
things,
mr.
judge
fitzpatrick
in
the
6th
day
of
april
1970
reentered
his
preliminary
order,
held
that
the
activities
of
the
defendant
in
panama
city
were
prima
facie
injurious
and
damaging
to
the
morals
and
manners
to
the
people
of
the
state
of
florida
were
prima
facie
subversive
to
public
order
and
decency
and
prima
facie
constituted
to
public
noise
and
nuisance.
and
that
the
plaintiff
had
demonstrated
irreparable
harm
and
damage,
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
being
a
state
to
the
morals
and
welfare
and
safety
of
the
people
of
state
of
florida.
there
was
no
evidence
before
that
court
of
any
kind
in
that
regard
and
the
court
ordered
there
further,
hereby,
enjoins
from
operating
and
maintaining
any
business
on
the
premises.
and
are
further
enjoined
from
removing
anything
from
the
premises.
and
thereafter,
an
immediate
request
was
made
were
superceduous.
staid
the
effect
of
the
order
your
honor
so
we
can
appeal.
no,
we
would
not
do
so.
immediate
request
for
superceduous
was
made
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
they
denied
the
same
and
by
order
denied
the
same
and
said
that
they
could
not
say
that
the
judge
below
was
in
error
and
denied
us
the
relief.
we
had
to
await
our
appellate
relief
there.
thereafter,
a
federal
suit
was
filed.
and
although,
judge
fitzpatrick
said,
the
defendants
can
have
an
expeditious
hearing
time
and
time
again,
defense
counsel
filed
a
request
for
an
expeditious
hearing
and
it
was
denied.
it
was
for
this
reason
that
the
federal
court
intervention
was
sought
because
we
felt
that
the
whole
circumstances
were
and
the
irreparable
harm
was
present.
we
wanted
to
prove
our
bad
faith.
we
felt
the
use
of
a
nuisance
law
and
the
way
it
was
used
in
this
case
was
erroneous
and
we
felt
we
would
like
to
have
the
right
and
we
would
like
to
have
the
right
to
go
back
to
a
district
court
and
so
demonstrate
that
to
the
court.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
that
is
why
i
say
that
we
would
want
the
right
to
go
back.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
all
i
said
sir,
was
--
that
it
was
a
good
discussion
of
what
this
court
had
said
in
younger
and
a
good
discussion
on
this
issue.
i
was
not
saying
that
it
was
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
it
is
just
a
good
discussion.
