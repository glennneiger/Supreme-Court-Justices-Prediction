mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
now
this
is
a
direct
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
a
three-judge
district
court
in
the
eastern
district
of
new
york,
holding
unconstitutional
a
provision
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952.
it
excludes
from
the
united
states
aliens
who
advocate,
or
whose
writings
advocate,
or
teach
the
doctrines
of
world
communism.
the
statute
involved
is
set
forth
at
pages
3
and
4
of
our
brief.
and
it
is
composed
as
far
as
this
litigation
is
concerned
of
two
sections.
the
first
is
section
212
(a),
which
says
except
as
otherwise
provided
the
following
classes
of
aliens
shall
be
ineligible
to
receive
visas
and
shall
be
excluded
from
admission
into
the
untied
states.
then
subdivision
28
says
aliens
would
any
time
have
been
members
of
the
following
classes.
i
will
now
just
combine
for
simplicity
sub-paragraphs
v
and
g
of
that.
what
it
says
is
that
aliens
who
advocate,
or
whose
writings
advocate
or
teach
the
economic,
international
and
governmental
doctrines
of
world
communism.
now
at
the
top
of
the
page
4,
is
another
provision
which
is
referred
to
as
the
waiver
provision.
and
what
it
says
is
that
in
the
event
of
an
alien
who
is
otherwise
ineligible
for
admission
under
the
prior
sections
of
which
28
is
one,
that
alien
maybe
temporarily
admitted
to
the
united
sates
after
approval
by
the
attorney
general
of
a
recommendation
either
by
the
secretary
of
state,
or
of
the
counselor
office
involved
that
the
alien
be
temporarily
admitted
in
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general,
so
that
for
this
provision
to
be
operative,
we
need
two
things.
first,
there
has
to
be
a
recommendation
for
a
way
but
by
either
the
counselor
official
involved
or
the
secretary
of
state,
and
secondly,
the
attorney
general
must
grant
the
waiver
in
his
discretion.
the
appellee,
dr.
mandel
is
a
belgian
citizen,
a
resident
of
brussels
who
is
a
prominent
marxist
economist.
he
is
not
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
but
he
describes
himself
as
a
revolutionary
marxist.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
a
revolutionary.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
communist
party.
no,
he's
not
interested
in
the
common
market.
the
district
court
described
him
as
an
orthodox
marxist
of
the
trotskyist
school.
apparently
he
does
not
agree
with
some
of
the
views
of
russian
communism,
but
he
is
saying
and
his
writings
indicate
he
is
urging
and
seeking
to
develop
a
revolution
under
which
the
workers
will
take
over
control.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
academic
life
primarily,
and
he
has
written
a
book
called,
marxist
economic,
that
is
considered
a
well-known
work
and
indeed
his
works
are
sometimes
studied
in
college.
and
we
think
that
under
the
statute
there
is
no
question
that
he
comes
within
the
definition
of
someone
who
advocates
the
doctrines
of
world
communism.
now
in
1962
and
1968,
dr.
mandel
came
to
this
country
pursuant
to
waivers
it
had
been
granted.
in
the
first
case
in
1962
he
came
here
as
a
journalist
and
in
the
second
year
he
came
here
to
give
a
series
of
lectures.
in
the
fall
of
1969,
he
again
sought
a
visa
in
brussels
for
the
purpose
of
giving
lectures
here
and
attending
various
meetings
in
the
academic
community.
the
first
application
which
he
filed,
he
filed
two
of
them
in
1969,
the
application
in
that
case
to
request
for
a
waiver,
--
the
question
of
a
waiver
was
denied
by
the
state
department
in
washington.
then
later
on
in
november
of
1969,
the
counsel
and
the
state
department
recommended
to
the
attorney
general
that
a
waiver
be
granted
to
dr.
mandel.
they
explained
that
on
the
earlier
occasion
in
1969,
they
had
declined
to
recommend
a
waiver
because
they
said
that
he
engaged
in
activities
beyond
the
stated
purpose
of
his
trip
when
he
came
to
this
country
in
1968.
however,
the
state
department
said
they
subsequently
learned,
that
when
he
made
his
previous
trip
to
the
united
states,
dr.
mandel
may
not
have
been
aware
of
the
fact.
that
he
came
here
pursuant
to
a
waiver
of
the
ineligibility
requirement.
and
therefore
may
not
have
been
aware
of
the
limitations
imposed
upon
his
trip
to
this
country.
and
they
also
pointed
out,
that
dr.
mandel
had
given
assurances
that
on
this
time
he
will
conform
to
his
stated
itinerary
and
purposes.
the
attorney
general
acting
through
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service,
to
whom
he
has
delegated
his
authority
under
this
statute
denied
the
waiver.
and
the
reason
is
most
clearly
set
forth,
i
think
in
the
paragraph
of
the
bottom
of
68
in
the
left,
which
is
the
record,
which
is
a
letter
from
the
associate
commission
of
operations
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
to
mr.
boudin,
dr.
mandel's
counsel.
and
what
this
letter
says
is
on
his
last
visit
in
1968
--.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
68,
i
am
sorry,
68
of
the
appendix,
mr.
chief
justice,
at
the
bottom
of
that
page
and
last
paragraph.
on
his
last
visit
in
1968,
mr.
mandel's
entry
was
authorized
for
a
series
of
academic
engagements
in
the
united
states.
his
activities
while
here
were
much
reported
to
the
press
and
went
far
beyond
the
stated
purposes
of
his
trip,
on
the
basis
of
which
his
admission
had
been
authorized
and
represented
a
flagrant
abuse
of
the
opportunities
afforded
him
to
express
his
views
in
this
country.
now
in
march
of
1970,
the
complaint
in
this
case
was
filed.
the
plaintiffs
dr.
mandel
and
sixth
american
university
professors.
the
general
allegation
of
the
complaint
was
that
the
statutory
provision
directing
the
exclusion
of
the
aliens
who
advocated
the
doctrine
of
world
communism,
was
unconstitutional
and
violation
of
the
first
and
fifth
amendments
and
that
the
waiver
provision
was
similarly
unconstitutional.
and
the
theory
however
is
rather
interesting
because
there
is
no
claim
in
this
case
that
the
plaintiffs
are
asserting
any
rights
on
behalf
of
dr.
mandel.
they
claim
their
asserting
their
first
amendment
rights
to
hear
to
mandel
and
to
discuss
it.
as
they
put
it
in
their
complaint
that
dr.
mandel's
exclusion
denied
then,
the
american
professors,
the
right
to
hear
mandel
in
university
and
other
public
forums
in
this
country,
and
to
exercise
their
freedom
of
academic
inquiry
by
engaging
mandel
in
an
open
and
face
to
face
exchange
of
information
and
opinions.
and
they
now
state
in
their
brief
at
page
14,
they
are
suing
only
to
enforce
their
rights
and
assert
none
on
the
part
of
the
invited
alien.
a
divided
three-judge
court
held
the
statute
unconstitutional
both
on
its
face
and
as
applied,
ended
a
declaratory
judgment
to
that
effect.
and
also
a
preliminary
injunction
enjoining
the
attorney
general
from
refusing
to
admit
dr.
mandel
on
a
temporarily
on
a
visa.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
do
mr.
justice,
i
do
mr.
justice,
that's
the
whole
theory
of
it
and
as
far
as
we
can
tell
the
court
to
did
not
decide
any
of
the
other
attacks
which
the
plaintiffs
made
upon
the
statute.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
question
is
whether
i
read
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
as
turning
solely
on
constitutional
grounds
and
my
answer
is
i
do.
i
think
the
opinion
makes
it
quite
clear.
the
court
recognized
that
although
dr.
mandel
himself
had
no
right
to
enter
this
country,
it
concluded
that
american
citizens
here
have
a
first
amendment
right
to
hear
him
and
to
exchange
views
with
him.
and
they
said
this
first
amendment
right
and
the
plaintiffs
must
prevail
over
the
government's
right
to
exclude
him
because,
the
government
was
excluding
him
not
because
he
was
actually
engaging
in
a
dangerous
activity,
but
merely
because
of
the
views
that
he
advocated.
they
then
went
on
to
say
that
as
far
as
the
wavier
was
concerned
that
where
the
exclusion
of
the
alien
impinges
on
rights
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
you
can't
let
that
as
admission
turned
on
the
discretionary
action
of
the
attorney
general
and
then
seemingly
a
little
inconsistent
with
that
went
on
and
said,
but
in
any
event
since
we
hold
that
the
government
has
no
right
to
exclude
him
at
all,
it's
irrelevant
whether
or
not,
the
discretion
was
properly
exercised.
now
in
the
district
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
it,
ii
am
not
certain
about
it,
let
me
just
--
if
i
made
just
look
at
the
statute
again.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
suppose
it
could
be
under
subsection
(j)
because
it
refers
to
who
knowingly
having
their
possession
for
the
purpose
of
circulation,
publication,
distribution,
or
display
any
written
or
printed
matter.
i
take
it
if
he
had
a
copy
of
mandel's
book
in
his
possession,
he
was
going
to
urge
the
students
to
read
that
he
could
be
excluded,
but
that
of
course
is
not
--
let
me
make
it
very
clear,
this
case,
because
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes
i
think,
i
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
the
academic
community
of
course
has
the
right
as
to
what
it
wants
to
teach
and
there
is
nothing.
there
is
nothing
at
all
in
this
situation
that
in
anyway
inhibits
any
of
the
plaintiffs
from
teaching
any
of
dr.
mandel's
theories,
from
discussing
any
of
mandel's
theories,
his
works
are
freely
available
here.
the
only
question
in
this
case
is
whether
they
have
a
constitutional
right
to
enforce,
to
force
the
government
to
admit
dr.
mandel,
so
they
can
talk
to
him
face
to
face,
so
that
they
can
discuss
things
with
him.
the
record
shows
in
this
case
that
on
one
occasion
after
he
was
denied
admission
on
audience
of
1200
people
in
town
hall
in
new
york
city
heard
by
a
tape
recording,
the
text
of
the
speech
he
would
have
been
planning
to
give
there.
so
his
views
are
freely
available
to
everyone
in
this
country.
the
only
question
is
whether
or
not
the
teachers
have
a
right
to
have
face
to
face
confrontations
with
a
man,
that
congress
is
said
is
ineligible
for
admission.
now
as
the
case
was
presented
to
the
district
court,
the
major
challenge
to
this
statute
was
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
exclusion
of
this
class
of
alien.
but
when
the
case
comes
to
this
court
the
appellees
have
rather
dramatically
shifted
their
argument.
as
i
read
their
brief
they
no
longer
are
attempting
to
defend
the
decision
of
the
district
court.
they
now
argue
not
that
the
statute
is
constitutional
but
that
the
refusal
of
the
attorney
general
to
grant
a
waiver
was
in
progress.
as
i
understand
the
argument
it
is
that
because
of
the
fact
that
these
people
want
to
hear
and
talk
to
this
man.
and
because
of
the
fact
that
they
say
all
he
is
doing
is
advocating
and
they
say,
they
have
some
first
amendment
right
to
see
him
face
to
face.
therefore
it
must
have
been
in
the
public
interest
for
the
attorney
general
to
have
admitted
this
man
and
therefore
his
failure
to
do
so
was
erroneous.
now
this
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
that
argument
has
not
been
abandoned.
the
argument
that
has
been
abandoned
is
that
the
statutes
on
its
face.
the
ban
on
the
admission
of
aliens
who
advocate
the
doctrines
of
world
communism.
but
that
is
on
its
face
invalid.
that
argument
as
i
understand
has
been
abandoned
in
this
court.
i
think
they
do
challenge,
they
do
challenge
the
contention,
the
effectiveness
of
the
wavier
but
even
there
as
i
understand
it,
it's
not
so
much
because
it
vests
un-reviewable
discretion
on
the
attorney
general
as
rather
that
the
attorney
general
improperly
exercises
discretion
in
this
case.
mr.
boudin
will
explain
little
further
but
that's
as
i
read
his
brief.
and
this
narrower
argument
is
one
that
was
not
made
in
the
district
court,
one
that
we
think
the
district
court
has
very
clearly
not
decided.
and
one
which
we
think
under
the
circumstances
is
not
appropriately
open
to
me
made
in
this
court.
if
in
fact
this
is
a
consideration
it's
one
we
think
that
should
be
made
on
the
district
court
if
the
case
goes
back
on
remand.
now
the
congressional
exclusion
of
varies
categories
of
aliens
has
a
long
history.
it
goes
back
almost
a
100
years.
that
began
in
1875
with
the
exclusion
of
two
categories,
convicts
and
prostitutes.
in
1903,
the
categories
of
excludable
aliens
were
expanded
to
include
among
other
anarchists
and
people
who
believe
in
or
advocate
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
or
violence.
progressively,
the
categories
of
excludable
aliens
were
expanded
and
in
1950,
in
the
internal
security
act
of
that
year,
was
a
provision,
comparable
to
the
provision
in
the
present
act
providing
for
the
exclusion
of
aliens
who
advocated
the
doctrines
of
world
communism.
this
expansion
was
based
on
congressional
findings.
in
the
1950
act
as
to
the
menace
of
world
communism,
as
to
the
dangers,
that
members
of
the
communist
movement
would
come
into
this
country
and
surreptitiously
subvert
our
institutions.
now,
for
almost
as
long
as
congress
has
excluded
categories
of
aliens
of
various
types.
this
court
has
recognized
the
broad
power
of
congress
to
do
so.
since
the
chinese
exclusion
case,
in
1889,
this
court
has
repeatedly
recognized
and
stressed
the
broad
authority
of
congress
to
exclude
aliens.
in
1904
almost
70
years
ago
in
the
case
called
turner,
that
the
court
upheld
that
how
to
exclude
an
anarchist
under
the
statute
as
it
was
then
written,
even
though
it
was
willing
to
assume
for
purposes
of
decision
that
the
anarchist
basic
attitude
was
primarily
philosophical
rather
than
actually
planning
to
destroy
the
government.
as
the
justice
frankfurter
stated
for
the
court
in
his
opinion
in
galvan
against
press
some
years
ago,
when
we
are
dealing
with
the
power
to
exclude
aliens
we
had
not
merely
a
page
of
history
put
a
whole
volume.
now
the
right
to
exclude
aliens
is
inherent,
in
the
sovereignty
of
any
nations.
it's
necessary
both
to
protect
the
domestic
security
of
the
nation
and
also
to
aided
in
the
conduct
of
foreign
relations.
so
the
contention
comes
down
to
is
this
basically
in
this
case
and
i
might
add
in
passing
that
appellees
themselves
in
this
court
and
the
district
court
recognized
that
mandel
as
such
has
no
right
to
enter.
so
the
contention
basically
comes
down
to
is
this.
even
though
dr.
mandel
himself
had
no
right
to
enter.
the
fact
that
the
appellees
want
to
hear
him
and
want
to
meet
with
him,
gives
them
a
right
to
compel
his
admission.
though,
as
they
have
greater
rights
to
compel
his
admission
to
this
country,
than
he
has.
we
know
of
no
case
that
has
held
or
even
suggested
that
this
kind
of
a
claim,
the
right
of
people,
the
claim
that
the
people
want
to
hear
someone
talk,
overwrites
the
power,
plenary
power
of
congress
to
exclude
aliens.
now
the
people
in
this
country
admittedly
have
a
first
amendment
right
to
listen
to
speaking
that
is
going
on,
they
do
normally
think
have
a
right
to
overrule
the
settled
power
of
the
congress
and
force
the
admission
of
an
alien
who
belongs
to
a
category
that
congress
has
said
is
not
be
admitted.
the
reason
we
think
this
statute
does
not
impinge
any
first
amendment
rights
of
the
appellees,
is
basically
it
relates
not
to
speech
but
to
action.
it
doesn't
bar
an
alien
from
speaking,
it
bars
the
alien
from
coming
in.
now
of
course,
obviously
if
he
can't
come
in,
he
can't
speak
here.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
can
send
tape
recordings,
he
could
send
books,
his
books
are
freely
brought
in
here.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh,
i
am
sorry
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
cannot
speak
in
person
here,
he
cannot
speak
in
person.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
see
no
reason
--
i
would
see
no
reason,
why
not.
i
would
see
no
reason,
why
not.
but
this
collateral
consequence,
this
collateral
consequence
of
his
exclusion
that
is
the
fact
that
as
a
result
of
that
people
here
cannot
meet
and
speak
with
him.
we
don't
think
that
turns
this
statute
into
a
law
of
congress
abridging
the
freedom
of
speech,
within
the
meaning
of
the
first
amendment.
this
court
had
very
similar
argument
presented
to
what
in
the
case
of
zemel
against
rusk
which
upheld
the
authority
of
the
secretary
of
state
to
denied
passports
to
cuba.
in
that
case,
mr.
zemel
said
that
he
wanted
to
satisfy
his
curiosity
about
the
state
of
affairs
in
cuba
and
that
his
visit
would
make
him
a
better
informed
citizen.
now
this
court
said
that
the
denial
of
a
passport
to
mr.
zemel
to
visit
cuba
invaded
no
first
amendment
rights
of
mr.
zemel,
and
the
reason
we
think
applies
equally
to
this
case.
this
is
what
the
court
said.
to
the
extent
that
the
secretary's
refusal
to
validate
passports
for
cuba
act
as
an
inhibition.
that
is
an
inhibition
on
obtaining
information
about
cuba
and
would
be
unrealistic
to
assume
that
it
does
not,
it
is
an
inhibition
of
action.
there
are
few
restrictions
on
action
which
could
not
be
closed
by
ingenious
argument
in
regard
of
decreased
data
flow.
the
right
to
speak
and
publish
does
not
carry
whether
the
unrestrained
right
to
gather
information.
and
we
think
the
same
principle
applies
in
this
case,
the
right
to
speak
freely
between
themselves,
the
right
perhaps
to
engage
in
face
to
face
dialog
with
speakers
in
this
country
does
not
give
them
the
right
to
insist
that
anyone
they
want
to
hear
can
be
brought
into
this
country.
so
as
far
as
the
holding
of
the
district
court
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
to
ban,
we
think
the
basic
error
of
the
district
court
as
i
think
is
demonstrated
in
the
dissenting
opinion
was
its
failure
to
recognize
the
broad
authority
of
congress
in
this
country
to
exclude
aliens
of
any
class.
now
let
me
come
to
the
other
aspect
of
the
case.
the
refusal
of
the
attorney
general
to
waive
dr.
mandel's
ineligibility.
now
of
course,
most
of
the
arguments
that
i
have
made
previously
apply
in
this
situation
too.
it
seems
to
us,
if
the
appellees
have
no
first
amendment
right
to
bring
them
into
here
and
it
seems
to
me
equally
they
have
no
first
amendment
right
to
complain
that
the
attorney
general
declined
to
waive
his
ineligibility.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
not
mistrust
mr.
justice,
congress
has
broadly
prohibited
admission
of
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
i
may
add
one
qualification
mr.
justice,
the
lion's
share
of
those
as
to
whom
an
affirmative
recommendation
was
made
by
the
counsel.
we
don't
know
if
the
counsel
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yeah.
but
if
there
is
--
if
the
cases
where
no
recommendation
is
made
then
it
never
gets
to
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
if
i
may
suggest
mr.
justice,
that
the
cases
i
have
cited
in
addition
to
recognizing
the
broad
discretion
of
the
congress
to
exclude
aliens
have
also
correspondingly
recognized
that
the
congress
may
delegate
to
administrative
officers
discretion
to
decide
whether
to
admit
or
exclude
a
particular
alien.
it's
not
just
that
congress
can
exclude,
the
congress
can
delegate.
i
would
like
to
refer
the
court
to
a
case
decided
some
years
ago
called
jay
against
boyd
which
we
have
discussed
in
our
brief
citied
in
our
brief
at
page
7.
that's
page
7
of
our
reply
brief.
page
7
of
our
--
and
that's
the
little
thin
thing.
but
i
will
expand
a
little
bit
on
the
discussion
of
jay
against
boyd
that
we
give
in
our
brief.
that
was
a
statute
very
close
to
this
statute.
it
provided
that
the
“the
attorney
general
may,
in
his
discretion,
virtually
the
same
language
that
we
have
here
suspend
deportation
of
an
alien
who
would
otherwise
be
deported.
the
statute
setup
various
such
conditions
which
had
to
be
met
before
an
alien
was
eligible
for
deportation.”
the
question
in
the
case
was
whether
an
alien
who
met
those
statutory
standards
could
nevertheless
be
denied
suspension
of
deportation
by
the
attorney
general
without
a
hearing
and
on
the
basis
of
confidential
information
known
only
to
the
attorney
general.
now
this
court
held
that
the
attorney
general
could
do
that.
and
the
reason
the
court
gave
was
that
congress
in
the
statute
have
left
it
to
the
unfettered
discretion
as
it
described
it
of
the
attorney
general
to
decide
a
particular
case,
whether
or
not
to
suspend
deportation.
it
pointed
out
that
the
congress
in
its
statute
did
not
provide
standards
for
determining
who
among
qualified
applicants
for
admission
should
receive
the
ultimate
relief.
that
determination
is
left
to
the
sound
discretion
of
the
attorney
general.
the
statute
says
that
as
to
qualified
deportable
aliens,
the
attorney
general
may
in
his
discretion
suspend
deportation.
it
does
not
restrict
the
considerations
which
maybe
relied
upon
or
the
procedure
by
which
the
discretion
should
be
exercised.
grant
thereof
is
manifestly,
not
a
matter
of
right
under
any
circumstances,
but
rather
in
all
cases
a
matter
of
grace.
and
we
think
that
the
language
applies,
principally
applies
equally
to
this
case.
congress
has
not
specified
any
standards
by
which
the
attorney
general
is
to
decide
in
his
discretion
whether
or
not
to
grant
away
for
ineligibility.
congress
obviously
left
it
to
the
attorney
general
to
consider
these
matters
taking
account
of
all
of
the
myriads
of
facts
that
enter
into
this
judgment.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
are
on
this
case,
because
mr.
justice,
the
district
court
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
because
the
district
court
has
struck
down.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
our
position
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
this
is
a
matter
within
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general.
now
let
me
say
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
court
has
said
that
mr.
justice
in
jay
against
boyd.
i
think
congress
can
in
many
of
decisions
of
this
court
recognized
that
in
dealing
with
aliens,
dealing
with
aliens,
what
congress
has
complete
authority
to
exclude
them.
congress,
we
think,
does
have
the
power
to
say
whether
you
are
going
to
permit
an
alien
of
the
excludable
class
to
be
admitted.
the
congress
can
leave
that
to
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general,
and
he
is
free
to
take
in
account
all
the
pertinent
considerations.
it
seems
to
us
that's
quite
clearly
what
congress
has
done
in
this
statute.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
now
this
is
a
direct
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
a
three-judge
district
court
in
the
eastern
district
of
new
york,
holding
unconstitutional
a
provision
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952.
it
excludes
from
the
united
states
aliens
who
advocate,
or
whose
writings
advocate,
or
teach
the
doctrines
of
world
communism.
the
statute
involved
is
set
forth
at
pages
3
and
4
of
our
brief.
and
it
is
composed
as
far
as
this
litigation
is
concerned
of
two
sections.
the
first
is
section
212
(a),
which
says
except
as
otherwise
provided
the
following
classes
of
aliens
shall
be
ineligible
to
receive
visas
and
shall
be
excluded
from
admission
into
the
untied
states.
then
subdivision
28
says
aliens
would
any
time
have
been
members
of
the
following
classes.
i
will
now
just
combine
for
simplicity
sub-paragraphs
v
and
g
of
that.
what
it
says
is
that
aliens
who
advocate,
or
whose
writings
advocate
or
teach
the
economic,
international
and
governmental
doctrines
of
world
communism.
now
at
the
top
of
the
page
4,
is
another
provision
which
is
referred
to
as
the
waiver
provision.
and
what
it
says
is
that
in
the
event
of
an
alien
who
is
otherwise
ineligible
for
admission
under
the
prior
sections
of
which
28
is
one,
that
alien
maybe
temporarily
admitted
to
the
united
sates
after
approval
by
the
attorney
general
of
a
recommendation
either
by
the
secretary
of
state,
or
of
the
counselor
office
involved
that
the
alien
be
temporarily
admitted
in
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general,
so
that
for
this
provision
to
be
operative,
we
need
two
things.
first,
there
has
to
be
a
recommendation
for
a
way
but
by
either
the
counselor
official
involved
or
the
secretary
of
state,
and
secondly,
the
attorney
general
must
grant
the
waiver
in
his
discretion.
the
appellee,
dr.
mandel
is
a
belgian
citizen,
a
resident
of
brussels
who
is
a
prominent
marxist
economist.
he
is
not
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
but
he
describes
himself
as
a
revolutionary
marxist.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
a
revolutionary.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
communist
party.
no,
he's
not
interested
in
the
common
market.
the
district
court
described
him
as
an
orthodox
marxist
of
the
trotskyist
school.
apparently
he
does
not
agree
with
some
of
the
views
of
russian
communism,
but
he
is
saying
and
his
writings
indicate
he
is
urging
and
seeking
to
develop
a
revolution
under
which
the
workers
will
take
over
control.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
academic
life
primarily,
and
he
has
written
a
book
called,
marxist
economic,
that
is
considered
a
well-known
work
and
indeed
his
works
are
sometimes
studied
in
college.
and
we
think
that
under
the
statute
there
is
no
question
that
he
comes
within
the
definition
of
someone
who
advocates
the
doctrines
of
world
communism.
now
in
1962
and
1968,
dr.
mandel
came
to
this
country
pursuant
to
waivers
it
had
been
granted.
in
the
first
case
in
1962
he
came
here
as
a
journalist
and
in
the
second
year
he
came
here
to
give
a
series
of
lectures.
in
the
fall
of
1969,
he
again
sought
a
visa
in
brussels
for
the
purpose
of
giving
lectures
here
and
attending
various
meetings
in
the
academic
community.
the
first
application
which
he
filed,
he
filed
two
of
them
in
1969,
the
application
in
that
case
to
request
for
a
waiver,
--
the
question
of
a
waiver
was
denied
by
the
state
department
in
washington.
then
later
on
in
november
of
1969,
the
counsel
and
the
state
department
recommended
to
the
attorney
general
that
a
waiver
be
granted
to
dr.
mandel.
they
explained
that
on
the
earlier
occasion
in
1969,
they
had
declined
to
recommend
a
waiver
because
they
said
that
he
engaged
in
activities
beyond
the
stated
purpose
of
his
trip
when
he
came
to
this
country
in
1968.
however,
the
state
department
said
they
subsequently
learned,
that
when
he
made
his
previous
trip
to
the
united
states,
dr.
mandel
may
not
have
been
aware
of
the
fact.
that
he
came
here
pursuant
to
a
waiver
of
the
ineligibility
requirement.
and
therefore
may
not
have
been
aware
of
the
limitations
imposed
upon
his
trip
to
this
country.
and
they
also
pointed
out,
that
dr.
mandel
had
given
assurances
that
on
this
time
he
will
conform
to
his
stated
itinerary
and
purposes.
the
attorney
general
acting
through
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service,
to
whom
he
has
delegated
his
authority
under
this
statute
denied
the
waiver.
and
the
reason
is
most
clearly
set
forth,
i
think
in
the
paragraph
of
the
bottom
of
68
in
the
left,
which
is
the
record,
which
is
a
letter
from
the
associate
commission
of
operations
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
to
mr.
boudin,
dr.
mandel's
counsel.
and
what
this
letter
says
is
on
his
last
visit
in
1968
--.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
68,
i
am
sorry,
68
of
the
appendix,
mr.
chief
justice,
at
the
bottom
of
that
page
and
last
paragraph.
on
his
last
visit
in
1968,
mr.
mandel's
entry
was
authorized
for
a
series
of
academic
engagements
in
the
united
states.
his
activities
while
here
were
much
reported
to
the
press
and
went
far
beyond
the
stated
purposes
of
his
trip,
on
the
basis
of
which
his
admission
had
been
authorized
and
represented
a
flagrant
abuse
of
the
opportunities
afforded
him
to
express
his
views
in
this
country.
now
in
march
of
1970,
the
complaint
in
this
case
was
filed.
the
plaintiffs
dr.
mandel
and
sixth
american
university
professors.
the
general
allegation
of
the
complaint
was
that
the
statutory
provision
directing
the
exclusion
of
the
aliens
who
advocated
the
doctrine
of
world
communism,
was
unconstitutional
and
violation
of
the
first
and
fifth
amendments
and
that
the
waiver
provision
was
similarly
unconstitutional.
and
the
theory
however
is
rather
interesting
because
there
is
no
claim
in
this
case
that
the
plaintiffs
are
asserting
any
rights
on
behalf
of
dr.
mandel.
they
claim
their
asserting
their
first
amendment
rights
to
hear
to
mandel
and
to
discuss
it.
as
they
put
it
in
their
complaint
that
dr.
mandel's
exclusion
denied
then,
the
american
professors,
the
right
to
hear
mandel
in
university
and
other
public
forums
in
this
country,
and
to
exercise
their
freedom
of
academic
inquiry
by
engaging
mandel
in
an
open
and
face
to
face
exchange
of
information
and
opinions.
and
they
now
state
in
their
brief
at
page
14,
they
are
suing
only
to
enforce
their
rights
and
assert
none
on
the
part
of
the
invited
alien.
a
divided
three-judge
court
held
the
statute
unconstitutional
both
on
its
face
and
as
applied,
ended
a
declaratory
judgment
to
that
effect.
and
also
a
preliminary
injunction
enjoining
the
attorney
general
from
refusing
to
admit
dr.
mandel
on
a
temporarily
on
a
visa.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
do
mr.
justice,
i
do
mr.
justice,
that's
the
whole
theory
of
it
and
as
far
as
we
can
tell
the
court
to
did
not
decide
any
of
the
other
attacks
which
the
plaintiffs
made
upon
the
statute.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
question
is
whether
i
read
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
as
turning
solely
on
constitutional
grounds
and
my
answer
is
i
do.
i
think
the
opinion
makes
it
quite
clear.
the
court
recognized
that
although
dr.
mandel
himself
had
no
right
to
enter
this
country,
it
concluded
that
american
citizens
here
have
a
first
amendment
right
to
hear
him
and
to
exchange
views
with
him.
and
they
said
this
first
amendment
right
and
the
plaintiffs
must
prevail
over
the
government's
right
to
exclude
him
because,
the
government
was
excluding
him
not
because
he
was
actually
engaging
in
a
dangerous
activity,
but
merely
because
of
the
views
that
he
advocated.
they
then
went
on
to
say
that
as
far
as
the
wavier
was
concerned
that
where
the
exclusion
of
the
alien
impinges
on
rights
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
you
can't
let
that
as
admission
turned
on
the
discretionary
action
of
the
attorney
general
and
then
seemingly
a
little
inconsistent
with
that
went
on
and
said,
but
in
any
event
since
we
hold
that
the
government
has
no
right
to
exclude
him
at
all,
it's
irrelevant
whether
or
not,
the
discretion
was
properly
exercised.
now
in
the
district
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
it,
ii
am
not
certain
about
it,
let
me
just
--
if
i
made
just
look
at
the
statute
again.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
suppose
it
could
be
under
subsection
(j)
because
it
refers
to
who
knowingly
having
their
possession
for
the
purpose
of
circulation,
publication,
distribution,
or
display
any
written
or
printed
matter.
i
take
it
if
he
had
a
copy
of
mandel's
book
in
his
possession,
he
was
going
to
urge
the
students
to
read
that
he
could
be
excluded,
but
that
of
course
is
not
--
let
me
make
it
very
clear,
this
case,
because
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes
i
think,
i
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
the
academic
community
of
course
has
the
right
as
to
what
it
wants
to
teach
and
there
is
nothing.
there
is
nothing
at
all
in
this
situation
that
in
anyway
inhibits
any
of
the
plaintiffs
from
teaching
any
of
dr.
mandel's
theories,
from
discussing
any
of
mandel's
theories,
his
works
are
freely
available
here.
the
only
question
in
this
case
is
whether
they
have
a
constitutional
right
to
enforce,
to
force
the
government
to
admit
dr.
mandel,
so
they
can
talk
to
him
face
to
face,
so
that
they
can
discuss
things
with
him.
the
record
shows
in
this
case
that
on
one
occasion
after
he
was
denied
admission
on
audience
of
1200
people
in
town
hall
in
new
york
city
heard
by
a
tape
recording,
the
text
of
the
speech
he
would
have
been
planning
to
give
there.
so
his
views
are
freely
available
to
everyone
in
this
country.
the
only
question
is
whether
or
not
the
teachers
have
a
right
to
have
face
to
face
confrontations
with
a
man,
that
congress
is
said
is
ineligible
for
admission.
now
as
the
case
was
presented
to
the
district
court,
the
major
challenge
to
this
statute
was
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
exclusion
of
this
class
of
alien.
but
when
the
case
comes
to
this
court
the
appellees
have
rather
dramatically
shifted
their
argument.
as
i
read
their
brief
they
no
longer
are
attempting
to
defend
the
decision
of
the
district
court.
they
now
argue
not
that
the
statute
is
constitutional
but
that
the
refusal
of
the
attorney
general
to
grant
a
waiver
was
in
progress.
as
i
understand
the
argument
it
is
that
because
of
the
fact
that
these
people
want
to
hear
and
talk
to
this
man.
and
because
of
the
fact
that
they
say
all
he
is
doing
is
advocating
and
they
say,
they
have
some
first
amendment
right
to
see
him
face
to
face.
therefore
it
must
have
been
in
the
public
interest
for
the
attorney
general
to
have
admitted
this
man
and
therefore
his
failure
to
do
so
was
erroneous.
now
this
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
that
argument
has
not
been
abandoned.
the
argument
that
has
been
abandoned
is
that
the
statutes
on
its
face.
the
ban
on
the
admission
of
aliens
who
advocate
the
doctrines
of
world
communism.
but
that
is
on
its
face
invalid.
that
argument
as
i
understand
has
been
abandoned
in
this
court.
i
think
they
do
challenge,
they
do
challenge
the
contention,
the
effectiveness
of
the
wavier
but
even
there
as
i
understand
it,
it's
not
so
much
because
it
vests
un-reviewable
discretion
on
the
attorney
general
as
rather
that
the
attorney
general
improperly
exercises
discretion
in
this
case.
mr.
boudin
will
explain
little
further
but
that's
as
i
read
his
brief.
and
this
narrower
argument
is
one
that
was
not
made
in
the
district
court,
one
that
we
think
the
district
court
has
very
clearly
not
decided.
and
one
which
we
think
under
the
circumstances
is
not
appropriately
open
to
me
made
in
this
court.
if
in
fact
this
is
a
consideration
it's
one
we
think
that
should
be
made
on
the
district
court
if
the
case
goes
back
on
remand.
now
the
congressional
exclusion
of
varies
categories
of
aliens
has
a
long
history.
it
goes
back
almost
a
100
years.
that
began
in
1875
with
the
exclusion
of
two
categories,
convicts
and
prostitutes.
in
1903,
the
categories
of
excludable
aliens
were
expanded
to
include
among
other
anarchists
and
people
who
believe
in
or
advocate
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
or
violence.
progressively,
the
categories
of
excludable
aliens
were
expanded
and
in
1950,
in
the
internal
security
act
of
that
year,
was
a
provision,
comparable
to
the
provision
in
the
present
act
providing
for
the
exclusion
of
aliens
who
advocated
the
doctrines
of
world
communism.
this
expansion
was
based
on
congressional
findings.
in
the
1950
act
as
to
the
menace
of
world
communism,
as
to
the
dangers,
that
members
of
the
communist
movement
would
come
into
this
country
and
surreptitiously
subvert
our
institutions.
now,
for
almost
as
long
as
congress
has
excluded
categories
of
aliens
of
various
types.
this
court
has
recognized
the
broad
power
of
congress
to
do
so.
since
the
chinese
exclusion
case,
in
1889,
this
court
has
repeatedly
recognized
and
stressed
the
broad
authority
of
congress
to
exclude
aliens.
in
1904
almost
70
years
ago
in
the
case
called
turner,
that
the
court
upheld
that
how
to
exclude
an
anarchist
under
the
statute
as
it
was
then
written,
even
though
it
was
willing
to
assume
for
purposes
of
decision
that
the
anarchist
basic
attitude
was
primarily
philosophical
rather
than
actually
planning
to
destroy
the
government.
as
the
justice
frankfurter
stated
for
the
court
in
his
opinion
in
galvan
against
press
some
years
ago,
when
we
are
dealing
with
the
power
to
exclude
aliens
we
had
not
merely
a
page
of
history
put
a
whole
volume.
now
the
right
to
exclude
aliens
is
inherent,
in
the
sovereignty
of
any
nations.
it's
necessary
both
to
protect
the
domestic
security
of
the
nation
and
also
to
aided
in
the
conduct
of
foreign
relations.
so
the
contention
comes
down
to
is
this
basically
in
this
case
and
i
might
add
in
passing
that
appellees
themselves
in
this
court
and
the
district
court
recognized
that
mandel
as
such
has
no
right
to
enter.
so
the
contention
basically
comes
down
to
is
this.
even
though
dr.
mandel
himself
had
no
right
to
enter.
the
fact
that
the
appellees
want
to
hear
him
and
want
to
meet
with
him,
gives
them
a
right
to
compel
his
admission.
though,
as
they
have
greater
rights
to
compel
his
admission
to
this
country,
than
he
has.
we
know
of
no
case
that
has
held
or
even
suggested
that
this
kind
of
a
claim,
the
right
of
people,
the
claim
that
the
people
want
to
hear
someone
talk,
overwrites
the
power,
plenary
power
of
congress
to
exclude
aliens.
now
the
people
in
this
country
admittedly
have
a
first
amendment
right
to
listen
to
speaking
that
is
going
on,
they
do
normally
think
have
a
right
to
overrule
the
settled
power
of
the
congress
and
force
the
admission
of
an
alien
who
belongs
to
a
category
that
congress
has
said
is
not
be
admitted.
the
reason
we
think
this
statute
does
not
impinge
any
first
amendment
rights
of
the
appellees,
is
basically
it
relates
not
to
speech
but
to
action.
it
doesn't
bar
an
alien
from
speaking,
it
bars
the
alien
from
coming
in.
now
of
course,
obviously
if
he
can't
come
in,
he
can't
speak
here.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
can
send
tape
recordings,
he
could
send
books,
his
books
are
freely
brought
in
here.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh,
i
am
sorry
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
cannot
speak
in
person
here,
he
cannot
speak
in
person.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
see
no
reason
--
i
would
see
no
reason,
why
not.
i
would
see
no
reason,
why
not.
but
this
collateral
consequence,
this
collateral
consequence
of
his
exclusion
that
is
the
fact
that
as
a
result
of
that
people
here
cannot
meet
and
speak
with
him.
we
don't
think
that
turns
this
statute
into
a
law
of
congress
abridging
the
freedom
of
speech,
within
the
meaning
of
the
first
amendment.
this
court
had
very
similar
argument
presented
to
what
in
the
case
of
zemel
against
rusk
which
upheld
the
authority
of
the
secretary
of
state
to
denied
passports
to
cuba.
in
that
case,
mr.
zemel
said
that
he
wanted
to
satisfy
his
curiosity
about
the
state
of
affairs
in
cuba
and
that
his
visit
would
make
him
a
better
informed
citizen.
now
this
court
said
that
the
denial
of
a
passport
to
mr.
zemel
to
visit
cuba
invaded
no
first
amendment
rights
of
mr.
zemel,
and
the
reason
we
think
applies
equally
to
this
case.
this
is
what
the
court
said.
to
the
extent
that
the
secretary's
refusal
to
validate
passports
for
cuba
act
as
an
inhibition.
that
is
an
inhibition
on
obtaining
information
about
cuba
and
would
be
unrealistic
to
assume
that
it
does
not,
it
is
an
inhibition
of
action.
there
are
few
restrictions
on
action
which
could
not
be
closed
by
ingenious
argument
in
regard
of
decreased
data
flow.
the
right
to
speak
and
publish
does
not
carry
whether
the
unrestrained
right
to
gather
information.
and
we
think
the
same
principle
applies
in
this
case,
the
right
to
speak
freely
between
themselves,
the
right
perhaps
to
engage
in
face
to
face
dialog
with
speakers
in
this
country
does
not
give
them
the
right
to
insist
that
anyone
they
want
to
hear
can
be
brought
into
this
country.
so
as
far
as
the
holding
of
the
district
court
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
to
ban,
we
think
the
basic
error
of
the
district
court
as
i
think
is
demonstrated
in
the
dissenting
opinion
was
its
failure
to
recognize
the
broad
authority
of
congress
in
this
country
to
exclude
aliens
of
any
class.
now
let
me
come
to
the
other
aspect
of
the
case.
the
refusal
of
the
attorney
general
to
waive
dr.
mandel's
ineligibility.
now
of
course,
most
of
the
arguments
that
i
have
made
previously
apply
in
this
situation
too.
it
seems
to
us,
if
the
appellees
have
no
first
amendment
right
to
bring
them
into
here
and
it
seems
to
me
equally
they
have
no
first
amendment
right
to
complain
that
the
attorney
general
declined
to
waive
his
ineligibility.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
not
mistrust
mr.
justice,
congress
has
broadly
prohibited
admission
of
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
i
may
add
one
qualification
mr.
justice,
the
lion's
share
of
those
as
to
whom
an
affirmative
recommendation
was
made
by
the
counsel.
we
don't
know
if
the
counsel
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yeah.
but
if
there
is
--
if
the
cases
where
no
recommendation
is
made
then
it
never
gets
to
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
if
i
may
suggest
mr.
justice,
that
the
cases
i
have
cited
in
addition
to
recognizing
the
broad
discretion
of
the
congress
to
exclude
aliens
have
also
correspondingly
recognized
that
the
congress
may
delegate
to
administrative
officers
discretion
to
decide
whether
to
admit
or
exclude
a
particular
alien.
it's
not
just
that
congress
can
exclude,
the
congress
can
delegate.
i
would
like
to
refer
the
court
to
a
case
decided
some
years
ago
called
jay
against
boyd
which
we
have
discussed
in
our
brief
citied
in
our
brief
at
page
7.
that's
page
7
of
our
reply
brief.
page
7
of
our
--
and
that's
the
little
thin
thing.
but
i
will
expand
a
little
bit
on
the
discussion
of
jay
against
boyd
that
we
give
in
our
brief.
that
was
a
statute
very
close
to
this
statute.
it
provided
that
the
“the
attorney
general
may,
in
his
discretion,
virtually
the
same
language
that
we
have
here
suspend
deportation
of
an
alien
who
would
otherwise
be
deported.
the
statute
setup
various
such
conditions
which
had
to
be
met
before
an
alien
was
eligible
for
deportation.”
the
question
in
the
case
was
whether
an
alien
who
met
those
statutory
standards
could
nevertheless
be
denied
suspension
of
deportation
by
the
attorney
general
without
a
hearing
and
on
the
basis
of
confidential
information
known
only
to
the
attorney
general.
now
this
court
held
that
the
attorney
general
could
do
that.
and
the
reason
the
court
gave
was
that
congress
in
the
statute
have
left
it
to
the
unfettered
discretion
as
it
described
it
of
the
attorney
general
to
decide
a
particular
case,
whether
or
not
to
suspend
deportation.
it
pointed
out
that
the
congress
in
its
statute
did
not
provide
standards
for
determining
who
among
qualified
applicants
for
admission
should
receive
the
ultimate
relief.
that
determination
is
left
to
the
sound
discretion
of
the
attorney
general.
the
statute
says
that
as
to
qualified
deportable
aliens,
the
attorney
general
may
in
his
discretion
suspend
deportation.
it
does
not
restrict
the
considerations
which
maybe
relied
upon
or
the
procedure
by
which
the
discretion
should
be
exercised.
grant
thereof
is
manifestly,
not
a
matter
of
right
under
any
circumstances,
but
rather
in
all
cases
a
matter
of
grace.
and
we
think
that
the
language
applies,
principally
applies
equally
to
this
case.
congress
has
not
specified
any
standards
by
which
the
attorney
general
is
to
decide
in
his
discretion
whether
or
not
to
grant
away
for
ineligibility.
congress
obviously
left
it
to
the
attorney
general
to
consider
these
matters
taking
account
of
all
of
the
myriads
of
facts
that
enter
into
this
judgment.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
are
on
this
case,
because
mr.
justice,
the
district
court
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
because
the
district
court
has
struck
down.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
our
position
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
this
is
a
matter
within
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general.
now
let
me
say
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
court
has
said
that
mr.
justice
in
jay
against
boyd.
i
think
congress
can
in
many
of
decisions
of
this
court
recognized
that
in
dealing
with
aliens,
dealing
with
aliens,
what
congress
has
complete
authority
to
exclude
them.
congress,
we
think,
does
have
the
power
to
say
whether
you
are
going
to
permit
an
alien
of
the
excludable
class
to
be
admitted.
the
congress
can
leave
that
to
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general,
and
he
is
free
to
take
in
account
all
the
pertinent
considerations.
it
seems
to
us
that's
quite
clearly
what
congress
has
done
in
this
statute.
