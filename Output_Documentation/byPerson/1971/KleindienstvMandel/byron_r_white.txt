do
you
think,
the
government's
case
would
be
stronger
or
weaker
if
the
attorney
general
had
said
i
am
refusing
entry,
because
i
don't
like
his
views
just
like
the
statute
says.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
more
arbitrary
to
give
no
reason
than
to
a
give
a
reason
that
i
don't
like
your
views?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
think
he
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
statute
does
authorize
exclusion
based
on

justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
attorney
general
says,
based
on
views,
i
am
going
to
keep
you
out.
that's
what
i
am
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
was
it
constitutional
to
give
him
the
discretion,
but
it's
unconstitutional
or
it's
important
not
to
exercise?

i
take
it
that
you
don't
think
you
have
to
--
i
take
it
you
think
you
can
concede
that
the
statute
is
valid
on
his
face
and
still
win.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
it
also
true
this
court
has
never
upset
a
decision
to
exclude
aliens
previously?
