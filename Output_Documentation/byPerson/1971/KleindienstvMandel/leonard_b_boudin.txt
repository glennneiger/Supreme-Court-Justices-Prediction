mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
we
will
begin
with
two
points.
one
suggested
out
of
questioning
of
mr.
justice
marshall
and
the
other
the
result
of
the
reference
jay
against
boyd
and
to
unfettered
discretion.
first,
this
is
of
course,
a
case,
a
suit
by
american
citizens,
american
university
professors
and
“dr.
mandel
was
in
a
sense
made
a
plaintiff
because
he
is
symbolic
of
a
problem.”
the
real
parties
of
interest
we've
conceded
from
the
beginning
are
only
the
american
university
professors
and
the
institutions
which
they
represent.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
they
are
asserting
their
rights
your
honor
and
not
his.
now
the
second
aspect
is
the
reference
to
jay
against
boyd
and
to
unfettered
discretion.
i
know
of
no
case
whether
it
deals
with
aliens
or
whether
it
deals
with
any
other
aspect
of
american
law
where
unfettered
discretion
has
been
upheld
by
this
court.
in
jay
against
boyd
the
problem
that
was
posed
there
was
whether
or
not
when
the
attorney
general
states
that
considerations
of
national
security
forbid
him
to
state
the
reason.
the
court
will
accept
the
good
faith
statement
of
the
attorney
general
and
we
would
too,
if
we
didn't
have
a
reason
stated
here
that
we
could
challenge.
and
in
hintopoulos
where
mr.
justice
harlan
did
recognize
that
the
suspension
of
deportation
was
a
matter
of
race,
he
added
in
the
concluding
paragraph
that
the
facts
in
that
case
show
that
attorney
general
had
not
acted
capriciously
or
arbitrarily
and
we
don't
think
that
in
any
case,
and
particularly
one
involving
the
first
amendment.
this
court
would
stand
for
the
proposition
that
if
we
had
a
fact
situation
which
we
think
we
can
establish
here,
where
there
is
arbitrary
and
capricious
denial
of
first
amendment
rights,
then
such
action
by
the
government
would
be
upheld.
now,
the
government
has
pointed
out
that
there
seems
to
a
shift
of
position
here.
i
may
say
there
maybe
a
shift
of
emphasis,
but
our
position
has
been
consistent.
in
the
court
below
on
behalf
of
the
america
plaintiffs,
as
i
say
saving
their
first
amendment
right,
we
took
the
position
very
much
similar
to
the
one
which
i
happen
to
have
taken
in
kent
against
dulles,
many
years
before,
arguing
that
the
statutes
on
their
face
as
applied
were
unconstitutional.
court
will
recall
that
it
took
a
more
limited
view
when
the
case
finally
came
up
and
said
that
the
statute
was
not
intended
to
apply,
because
of
the
first
amendment
rights
that
were
involved
to
the
situation
there
namely
the
denial
of
passports
for
political
reasons.
but
we
also
took
in
this
case
as
your
honors
will
see
from
our
complaint,
a
direct
attack
upon
the
attorney
general's
action
as
capricious
and
as
without
any
foundation.
we
did
not
give
up
either
point
when
we
opposed
the
appeal
here.
what
we
did
was
attempt
to
support
the
decision
on
a
narrower
ground
following
the
standard
practice
in
this
court
or
seeking
a
narrow
ground
if
it
could
be
done
in
declaring
a
statute
unconstitutional.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no,
the
district
court
didn't
pass
on
our
alternatives,
because
the
government
really
didn't
give
it
the
chance
to.
it
wasn't
our
fault,
it
was
the
government
that
said
through
an
affidavit
filed
by
assistant
us
attorney
baker,
this
matter
is
un-revealable.
we
decline
to
give
any
reason
to
the
district
court.
had
the
government
given
a
reason
to
the
district
court,
as
it
now
it
does
here,
i
think
the
district
court
would
have
then
said
the
action
taken
was
un-revealable.
but
our
rights
should
not
be
fought
for
two
years
later
after
the
litigation
began,
because
they
decided
to
stand
on
a
fundamental
principle
and
not
offer
any
reasons.
now,
let
me
point
out
the
shift
of
positions
taken
by
the
government,
not
because
they
are
inconsistent,
but
because
as
we
have
done
in
changes
of
emphasis,
the
government
has
had
a
perfect
right
to
do
it,
but
they
do
bear
a
relationship,
because
on
each
one
they
pose
a
proposition
upon
which
we
take
issue.
in
the
district
court
as
i
indicated
before
the
government
said
it
had
a
absolute
--
the
attorney
general
had
an
absolute,
an
un-revealable
exercise
of
discretion.
i
will
address
myself
to
that
shortly.
in
the
main
brief
here,
bearing
in
mind
what
the
district
court
had
done
in
holding
the
statute
not
on
its
face,
but
as
applied
to
this
particular
academic
situation
invalid.
as
applied
here,
the
government
took
the
basic
position
that
the
exclusion
and
deportation
cases
were
exercised
of
the
sovereign
power
of
the
federal
government,
the
congress.
now,
if
we
had
that
statute
before,
and
if
we
were
not
able
to
give
as
we
think
we
now
have
been
able
to
give
an
alternative
constitutional
interpretation
to
the
statute
and
shift
the
emphasis
to
the
attorney
general's
violations
of
the
congressional
intent,
which
i
should
try
to
establish
and
shift
the
statute
to
a
position
which
the
attorney
general
has
acted
arbitrarily
regardless
of
statutory
intent
in
denying
the
american
citizens
access
to
dr.
mandel
here
for
these
academic
discussions.
now
let's
say
that
even
a
statute
of
this
kind
for
the
reasons
indicated
by
the
court
below
and
in
the
o'brian
case
would
be
invalid.
i
would
then
argue
that
there
is
no
substantial
legitimate
governmental
interest
in
excluding
a
person
of
dr.
mandel's
economic
and
philosophical
views.
we
are
not
dealing
here
remember
with
(a)27
category.
we
are
not
dealing
which
are
the
people
who
are
absolutely
forbidden.
we
are
not
dealing
with
the
(a)29
category
which
deals
with
people
who
violate
laws.
we
are
dealing
with
(a)27
d
and
g.
we
aren't
dealing
with
the
other
(a)27
categories
of
those
people
whom
congress
considered
more
activist.
then
we
present
the
former
member
of
communist
party.
i
would
then
argue
that
this
category
of
persons
should
not
be
prevented
from
meeting
with
american
academicians,
universities
where
no
substantial
interest
of
the
government
is
shown
and
under
the
o'brien
case
involving
the
destruction
of
draft
card
as
the
court
remember.
the
court
did
set
forth
certain
tests,
and
one
of
them
was
that
there
must
be
a
predominating
government
interest,
the
otherwise
the
effect
--
the
court
raised
the
question
of
whether
the
effect
was
direct
or
incidental
to
first
amendment
rights.
then
came
the
question
of
the
least
restricted
means.
the
test
referred
to
in
shelton,
but
used
in
other
words
namely,
whether
it's
essential
to
a
governmental
interest
in
o'brien.
now,
when
the
government
filed
its
brief,
its
reply
brief
here
which
i
recited
and
probably
some
members
of
the
court
had
not
yet
received.
the
government
then
went
back,
not
possibly
as
a
result
of
our
briefs,
and
i
am
not
complaining,
went
back
to
the
original
assertion
which
it
had
made
in
the
district
court
of
an
unlimited
and
un-reviewable
exercise
of
executive
discretion.
except
it
did
one
more
thing
as
a
matter
of
precaution
which
it
didn't
do
in
the
district
court,
it
gave
a
reason.
the
reason
they
flagrant
abuse
of
dr.
mandel's
1968
trip
which
i
think
the
court
will
realize
is
superficial
and
not
agreed
to
by
the
state
department
and
persisted
in
by
the
government
is
really
all
i
have
to
do
is
say
it's
a
case
of
bureaucratic,
lower
bureaucratic
stubbornness.
and,
as
i
say
bureaucratic
stubbornness,
because
there
is
no
foundation
for
the
action,
for
the
argument
now
made
by
the
attorney
general
that
would
happen
in
1968,
namely
the
fact
that
at
a
cocktail
party
that
dr.
mandel
attended
in
which
an
event
occurred
at
the
end
in
which
he
had
nothing
to
do
namely
the
selling
the
postage
for
french
students.
this
is
basically
the
flagrant
abuse
that
is
relied
on
by
the
attorney
general
in
this
case.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
think
they
are
they
are
quite
similar
powers.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
think
it
has
been
supported,
but
in
no
case
has
been
supported
where
the
court
has
found.
i
refer
to
jay
against
boyd
and
hintopoulos
where
there
has
been
a)
arbitrary
action
on
the
party
of
attorney
general
which
we
think
the
court
will
easily
find
here,
and
b)
where
the
first
amendment
rights
of
american
citizens
are
involved.
that's
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
began
in
this
case
by
conceding
that
the
alien's
rights
are
not
involved,
they
don't
have
the
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
think
it
it
did
your
honor,
but
i
think
it
found
that
as
a
practical
matter
there
was
no
arbitrary
action
on
the
part
of
the
attorney
general.
in
other
words,
the
reasons
it
gave
for
withholding
information
were
considered
sufficient.
and
there
is
always
in
a
whole
line
of
cases
beginning
with
chinese
exclusion
all
the
way
down
to
harisiades
and
so
forth,
a
statement
of
the
very
broad
powers
of
congress.
the
question
however
is,
whether
there
is
in
any
area
an
unlimited
executive
power,
something
we
address
ourselves
to
in
our
brief,
or
even
an
unlimited
congressional
power.
i
would
wonder
for
example,
although
i
had
intended
to
turn
to
this
determining
in
analyzing
the
executive's
action;
whether
a
congressional
statute
which
said
that
a
person
who
was
not
in
an
activist
class,
but
is
a
celebrated
economic,
the
economist
in
lots
of
school.
if
congress
had
passed
a
statute
saying
that
the
entry
into
the
united
states
for
a
brief
visit
of
such
a
person
for
the
purpose
of
attending
an
academic
meeting
with
professor
richard
falk
of
princeton
would
be
forbidden,
because
professor
falk
has
written
as
one
of
the
editors
of
american
journal
of
international
law.
articles
against
our
opposition,
opposition
in
the
vietnam
war.
is
it
conceivable
that
such
a
statute
despite
the
plenary
power
would
not
be
stricken
down
and
recognizes
an
violation
of
first
amendment
rights
of
professor
falk
and
i
don't
want
to
go
into
examples,
but
i
would
rather
move
into
the
questions
which
i
am
next
addressing
myself
to.
that
is
the
statute
itself
and
is
it
acceptable
of
constitutional
construction
which
would
not
give
the
vast
powers
to
the
attorney
general
suggested
and
which
in
fact
challenges
those
vast
powers.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
think
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
distinguish
any
case
and
i
am
not
to
be
familiar
with
that
particular
problem.
although,
i
know
i
have
been
involved
in
some
litigation
which
may
touch
on
that.
those
don't
involve
the
first
amendment
rights
of
america.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
exactly,
in
other
words
in
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
precisely,
i
am
relying
specifically
upon
three
lines
of
decisions
which
this
court
has
handed
down.
the
first
is
the
recognition
in
shelton
against
tucker
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
concurring
opinion
and
mr.
justice
harlan
in
sweezy.
the
special
role
of
the
university.
i
am
warned
against
being
a
leadist
(ph)
here
by
my
colleagues,
but
the
fact
is
that
the
university
is
very
important.
i
include
schools
as
well,
in
terms
of
our
democratic
system.
the
second
principle,
i
rely
upon
is
a
line
of
decisions
which
range
--
i
can't
go
back
much
further
for
the
moment
in
de
jonge
against
oregon
in
going
up
to
new
york
times
against
sullivan
and
of
course
the
red
lion
case
on
which
i
rely
specifically.
and
that
line
relates
to
what
maybe
a
cliché,
but
if
so
it's
a
fundamental
one.
namely,
the
relationship
of
the
first
amendment
to
the
sovereignty
of
the
people.
as
opposed
to
the
governmental
sovereignty,
sovereign
rights
which
he
here
claims.
and
the
third
line
suggested,
i
think
a
few
minutes
ago,
is
a
line
of
the
right
to
know
which
began
at
least
within
my
memory
in
martin
against
struthers
and
moved
into
the
lamont
case
which
again
involved
i
thought
a
very
great
powerful
power
of
the
government
to
refuse
the
entry
of
communist
material.
but
which
the
court
held
referred
specifically
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
concurring
opinion
i
believe
there,
that
we
were
dealing
again,
not
with
the
rights
of
the
communist
who
were
sending
literature,
but
we
were
dealing
with
the
rights
of
the
receiver
and
i
distinguish
this
case
from
the
cases
which
involved
foreign
monies
coming
here
or
monies
going
to
abroad
or
schilling
against
rogers
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act
cases.
i
am
dealing
exclusively
with
the
question
of
the
first
amendment
rights
of
americans.
now,
what
the
government
says
in
response
is
that
it
has
a
right
to
be
arbitrary.
the
executive
says,
because
it
says
congress
has
given
it
this
power.
before
i
turn
again
to
the
congressional
power,
let
me
say
that
i
think
another
principle,
the
court
has
laid
down
in
stovall
and
in
(inaudible)
and
in
red
lion
is
that
the
government
cannot
be
arbitrary
and
i
don't
have
before
me,
the
precise
quotation
where
mr.
justice
white
made
some
reference
to
the
limitations
upon
the
bureaucratic
irresponsibility.
it's
a
very
rough
paraphrase
to
us.
the
question
however
is
that
congress
intends
to
give
this
power
to
the
attorney
general.
now,
the
government
has
said
that
the
statute
is
read
in
the
way
indicated.
let
me
add
to
the
construction
of
the
statue
that
there
are
two
kinds
of
persons
involved
in
ineligibility,
a
political
ineligibility
primarily.
the
first
is
a
category
on
which
congress
has
passed
the
complete
ban;
that's
the
(a)28
it's
(a)27,
the
(a)28
and
the
section
f
where
the
president
has
the
power
to
declare
people
inadmissible.
the
second
this
is
(a)27
category
that
we
are
dealing
here.
and
particularly,
the
(a)27
d
and
g.
now,
the
question
is
did
congress
intend
to
give
unlimited
power
to
the
attorney
general
or
is
there
some
standard
particularly
in
the
light
of
the
first
amendment
situation
to
which
we
are
directing
ourselves
here,
namely
the
american
academic
situation.
are
there
any
limitations
at
all?
well,
they
can
be
found
not
in
the
statutory
language,
but
they
can
be
found
in
two
or
three
reports
of
congress
cited
by
us
and
by
the
government
in
our
briefs
which
your
honors
will
see.
in
which
the
public
interest,
admittedly
a
difficult
concept,
but
i
am
sure
applied
very
often,
if
the
field
is
not
relating
to
the
first
amendment,
in
which
congress
stated
that
it
was
in
the
public
interest
that
the
attorney
general
exercised
his
discretionary
power.
the
alternative
was
also
humanity
which
i
am
not
suggesting
to
involve
here
in
main
reasons.
now
in
addition
to
that
the
statistics
which
i
think
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out
are
really
significant,
because
in
1969,
for
example,
the
critical
year
here,
at
least
for
the
purpose
of
this
case
about
5,000
recommendations
were
made
by
american
council
abroad
for
the
most
part
to
the
department
of
justice.
and
that
very
important
administrative
practice
showed
that
only
nine
applications
were
denied
by
the
attorney
general
and
our
guess,
no
basis
and
the
government
doesn't
have
the
facts
that
those
nine
were
probably
not
cases;
probably
not
cases
in
which
the
secretary
of
state
himself
or
the
persons
important
to
the
bureau
security
council
affairs.
so
it
was
important
that
dr.
mandel
come
here
and
probably
cases
where
only
council
is
involved
and
probably
cases
where
you
had
political
activist
school.
now
i
have
jumped
to
the
legal
analysis
here
and
to
the
administrative
implementation
urging
again
that
the
court
take
a
narrow
view
of
the
powers
given
here
in
order
to
avoid
constitutional
problem,
but
i
don't
want
to
miss
the
critical
facts,
which
as
usual
one
misses
when
he
meets
the
government's
argument
on
the
law.
the
critical
facts
are
that
the
start
here
is
not
from
mandel
who
wanted
to
come
here.
he
celebrated
and
love
to
live
in
europe
and
to
receive
the
respect
of
other
universities.
dr.
mandel
who
came
here
in
1968
and
delivered
lectures
before
30
american
universities
including
princeton,
was
invited
in
1969
to
debate
professor
galbraith
of
harvard
at
stanford
university
with
the
administration's
approval.
and
then
followed
six
other
invitations
--
and
many
other
invitations
of
which
he
accepted
six,
and
where
the
americans
wanted
him,
not
he
who
wanted
come
here
particularly.
now,
the
applications
were
denied
and
it
turns
out
if
i
could
short-circuit
it,
the
applications
were
denied
because
of
this
assumption
that
somehow
rather
he
had
technically
violated
the
conditions
of
his
coming
in
earlier.
but
the
american
council
and
the
state
department
recognized
that
this
was
an
error
on
their
part.
they
had
not
told
him
when
they
gave
him
the
visas
that
he
was
politically
ineligible
and
therefore
conditions
with
entry
of
acts.
he
had
assumed
that
he
was
eligible
as
he
had
the
american
academicians.
and
it
was
only
because
he
came
in
not
as
an
eligible,
but
one
whose
eligibility
was
weighed
that
these
conditions
which
are
really
very
technical
and
hardly
an
important
state
interest
were
suggested
by
the
american
council
for
the
first
time,
as
a
reason
for
excluding
dr.
mandel
and
not
making
a
recommendations
after
his
stay.
i
was
then
communicated
with,
not
by
dr.
mandel,
i
am
not
a
marxist,
we
are
obviously
friends.
i
was
communicated
by
the
american
academic
community
which
said
we
want
this
man
here
and
we
want
to
debate
with
him.
we
want
to
engage
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
oh,
i
can
clear.
i
think
it
is
very
important
that
the
first
amendment
rights
of
the
academicians
involved
here,
i
don't
question
that
at
all
and
i
wouldn't
just
here
--.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
remember
your
honor
--
mr.
chief
justice,
i
warned
myself
about
leaders
and
i
am
not
sure.
i
do
think
however
that
the
importance
of
education,
whether
at
schools
or
universities
as
such
that
the
court
will
treat
that
aspect
very
often,
how
you
should
make
the
inception,
will
treat
that
aspect
differently
than
it
we
will
treat
for
example
dr.
mandel's
desire
to
deliver
a
talk
to
an
unlimited
american
audience
who
had
not
invited
him
to
come
here.
and
in
that
sense,
i
think
there
are
gradations,
as
we
saw
in
the
last
several
case
there,
gradations
of
rights
of
access
to
buildings
for
the
labor
reasons
and
gradations
of
first
amendment
rights,
at
least
each
case
must
be
considered
on
its
own.
now,
the
attorney
general
here
in
his
action
we
think
therefore
in
the
light
of
what
i
have
said
is
a
very
sparse
congressional
history
but
a
very
satisfactory
administrative
practice.
we
think
is
acted
arbitrarily
and
in
violation
of
the
first
amendment
as
well
as
in
violation
of
a
public
interest
concept
and
is
because
your
honors
will
recall
reading
the
brief,
what
i
have
not
said
that
the
department
of
state
in
washington;
when
i
approached
them
said
representing
the
academicians,
i
want
a
meeting
between
the
university
professors
and
you,
writing
to
mr.
elliot
richardson
then
on
the
secretary
of
state,
i
had
known
of
his
interest,
the
freedom
of
speech
from
his
articles
in
the
harvard
law
review
many
years
ago
on
the
dennis
case.
i
thought
he
was
a
right
man
to
write
to.
and
the
response
was
that
we
do
recognize
that
this
may
have
been
an
error,
a
misunderstanding
between
dr.
mandel
and
ourselves.
we
do
recognize
the
importance
of
the
academic
community
and
its
interest
in
the
thing,
and
finally
came
the
recommendation
of
the
secretary
of
the
state.
yes,
in
the
interest
of
freedom
of
speech
and
freedom
of
opinion
dr.
mandel
should
be
admitted
and
the
answer
of
the
attorney
general
was,
no,
and
as
your
honor
has
seen
me
tracing
it,
no
for
no
reason;
now
no
for
a
reason.
now
all
of
these
cases
with
respect
to
reviewability
that
is
suggested
by
the
attorney
general.
on
that
cases
in
which
the
court
has
denied
justiciability,
that
cases
in
which
the
court
has
weighed
the
factors,
war
power
o'brien
and
(inaudible).
one
for
the
individual,
the
other
against
the
individual.
foreign
policies
zemel
and
that
was
very
real.
i
argued
zemel;
i
radically
lost,
but
i
argued
zemel
here
and
i
urged
the
first
amendment
rights
on
the
part
of
zemel
being,
even
though
the
matter
was
phrased
in
terms
of
its
individual
curiosity
to
see
what
would
happen
in
cuba.
but
they
were
very
strong
foreign
policy
reasons
urged
by
the
government
before
this
court,
evaluated
by
this
court
and
upheld
by
the
court.
is
this
tactical
violation
to
being
at
a
cocktail
party
be
equivalent
of
our
relations
with
cuba
and
(inaudible)
in
cuba.
in
the
field
of
national
security
again
harisiades
and
all
of
these
cases
received
very
careful
analysis
in
the
court
and
the
court
that
divided
of
course
in
many
of
those
cases.
even
in
the
field
of
immigration
as
i
indicated
before,
the
government
is
quite
right
in
citing
this
mr.
justice
powell's
one
line
statement
of
that
fact
that
it's
a
matter
of
race,
but
quite
i
will
call
delinquent
in
error
in
failing
to
give
his
concluding
line
that
they
did
not
regard
the
considerations
involved
there
as
being
arbitrary
and
unreasonable
and
capricious
and
so
we
now
come
down
to
the
conclusion
of
our
problem
here;
a)
no
reason
given
in
the
court
below,
b)
no
foundation
in
fact
suggested
and
the
use
of
the
word
'flagrant
abuse'
is
really
a
hyperbole
which
i
regret
to
say
that
government
adopted
from
their
earlier
letter
sent
by
one
of
the
immigration
officials.
we
have
here
a
situation
where
the
opinion
of
the
secretary
of
state
which
certainly
indicates
that
foreign
relations
are
not
affected.
because
if
dr.
mandel
for
example
had
been,
let
us
say
at
the
moment,
a
soviet
marxist,
and
soviets
were
not
allowing
our
economist
to
come
in.
or
even
if
we
had
a
position
of
opposition
to
the
soviet
government
which
we
wanted
to
demonstrate,
then
this
court
would
have
to
weigh
the
question,
whether
the
first
amendment
rights
of
the
academicians
in
the
universities
overbalance
this
or
it
doesn't,
the
state
department's
decision.
and
i
suspect
it
would
come
out
against
the
universities
in
such
a
case.
but
we
have
here
a
statement
that
on
the
history
i
have
given
you,
in
other
words
attacking
the
statute
and
not
just
as
written,
but
as
applied.
we
are
attacking
and
we
attacked
in
our
complaint
the
action
of
the
attorney
general
is
frivolous
and
is
unreasonable
and
without
foundation.
this
is
real
frivolity.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
don't
think
your
honor.
i
think
each
case
is
going
to
depend
in
the
end
and
somewhat
you
had
said
earlier
on
one
of
the
occasion
on
its
own
facts.
we
have
here
a
case
of
scholarly
discussion
at
american
universities
recognized
by
those
universities
important
for
the
education
of
those
people.
we
don't
have
ad
hoc
group
saying
either
sympathetic,
but
not
sympathetic
to
dr.
mandel,
we
would
like
to
hear
you.
we
have
the
most
eminent
professors
and
the
most
eminent
universities
who
feel
that
it's
important
as
i
think
we
all
do,
important
that;
that
there
be
a
counter
discussion,
the
discussion
of
issues
here.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
then
i
think
i
would
be
faced
with
an
attack
on
the
statute
and
i
would
have
a
harder
burden,
but
i
would
attack
the
statute.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
if
the
attorney
general
had
said
i
am
following
the
statute
strictly
--
well,
i
don't
think
the
attorney
general
could
do
that.
the
attorney
general
in
each
case
is
exercising
discretion.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
think
the
statement
--
the
problem
you
are
posing
mr.
justice
is
one
in
which
we
are
faced
with
where
the
statute
says,
there
is
an
absolute
ban;
and
that
would
place
a
burden
on
me
and
i
would
have
to
meet
it
is
for
court
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
it
does
and
i
would
challenge
that,
but
i
don't
think
that
i
have
to
challenge
that.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
think
that
would
be
improper,
because
congress
intended
the
attorney
general
exercised
the
discretion
with
respect
to
the
views
also.
congress
didn't
say
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
it
depends
on
how
it's
exercised.
i
think
the
attorney
general
in
each
one
of
these
cases
does
exercise
discretion,
i
would
assume
that
so
in
good
faith.
now,
i
think
all
of
our
situation
as
i
think
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
but
only
purposes
of
winning.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
for
the
other
purpose
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no,
i
would
not
say
that.
well,
the
question
of
what
is
subject
judicial
review
and
when
the
courts
will
overrule
the
attorney
general
is
another
problem
almost
everything
is
subject
to
judicial
review
in
this
country,
but
tremendous
deference
is
obviously
paid
to
the
views
of
congress
and
even
to
the
attorney
general.
i
would
say
that
given
a
situation
where
the
attorney
general
is
given
a
reason,
and
sometimes
giving
a
reason
could
be
worse
than
not
giving
a
reason.
and
given
a
reason
which
this
court
can
say,
is
absolutely
absurd,
it's
frivolous.
and
if
the
attorney
general
for
example
had
given
a
reason
that
i
had
suggest,
there
another
one,
that
professor
(inaudible)
would
recall
him
is
a
rather
conservative
at
least
by
dr.
mandel's
standards,
professor
of
economics
had
written
books
criticizing
our
american
economic
policy,
and
he
wanted
dr.
mandel
in
his
university
in
the
new
school
of
social
research.
he
wanted
dr.
mandel
to
come
here.
it
would
be
frivolous
and
it
would
be
unreasonable,
it
would
be
in
violation
of
the
first
amendment
rights
to
deny
his
right
to
access
to
dr.
mandel.
i
don't
think
we
have
to
take
a
lot
of
whole
statute,
and
particularly
we
will
need
to
do
so.
i
urged
in
the
court
below.
i
don't
think
we
have
to
do
so,
if
we
can
say
a;
either
that
the
attorney
general's
position
is
arbitrary
and
unreasonable
one,
and
that
this
court
have
never
upheld
a
decision
which
it
said
was
unreasonable
and
arbitrary
by
the
executive
branch,
or
,
we
say
congress
intended
there
be
some
standards
here,
and
that
one
of
the
things
congress
did
not
intend
is
that,
because
of
what
i
call
simply
bureaucratic
stubbornness,
the
rights
of
the
american
academic
community
should
be
rejected.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
think
your
honor
is
correct,
that
the
court
has
never
excluded
aliens.
but
i
will
say
that
in
no
case,
in
the
history
of
this
court
including
the
turner
case,
the
famous
amicus
case
argued
by
clarence
darrow
and
edgar
lee
masters
in
this
court.
in
no
case
has
it
been
the
first
amendment
rights
of
the
american
citizens
that
was
alleged.
they
were
never
the
plaintiffs,
poor
mr.
turner.
i
guess
it
was
turner,
they
confuse
with
that
turner
too.
poor
mr.
turner
was
a
man
who
was
asserting
as
an
alien
his
first
amendment
rights.
well,
it's
a
long
time,
it's
pretty
late.
i
would
like
to
re-argue
turner
against
williams,
but
it's
too
late,
and
if
clarence
darrow
failed,
i
would
certainly
fail.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
we
will
begin
with
two
points.
one
suggested
out
of
questioning
of
mr.
justice
marshall
and
the
other
the
result
of
the
reference
jay
against
boyd
and
to
unfettered
discretion.
first,
this
is
of
course,
a
case,
a
suit
by
american
citizens,
american
university
professors
and
“dr.
mandel
was
in
a
sense
made
a
plaintiff
because
he
is
symbolic
of
a
problem.”
the
real
parties
of
interest
we've
conceded
from
the
beginning
are
only
the
american
university
professors
and
the
institutions
which
they
represent.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
they
are
asserting
their
rights
your
honor
and
not
his.
now
the
second
aspect
is
the
reference
to
jay
against
boyd
and
to
unfettered
discretion.
i
know
of
no
case
whether
it
deals
with
aliens
or
whether
it
deals
with
any
other
aspect
of
american
law
where
unfettered
discretion
has
been
upheld
by
this
court.
in
jay
against
boyd
the
problem
that
was
posed
there
was
whether
or
not
when
the
attorney
general
states
that
considerations
of
national
security
forbid
him
to
state
the
reason.
the
court
will
accept
the
good
faith
statement
of
the
attorney
general
and
we
would
too,
if
we
didn't
have
a
reason
stated
here
that
we
could
challenge.
and
in
hintopoulos
where
mr.
justice
harlan
did
recognize
that
the
suspension
of
deportation
was
a
matter
of
race,
he
added
in
the
concluding
paragraph
that
the
facts
in
that
case
show
that
attorney
general
had
not
acted
capriciously
or
arbitrarily
and
we
don't
think
that
in
any
case,
and
particularly
one
involving
the
first
amendment.
this
court
would
stand
for
the
proposition
that
if
we
had
a
fact
situation
which
we
think
we
can
establish
here,
where
there
is
arbitrary
and
capricious
denial
of
first
amendment
rights,
then
such
action
by
the
government
would
be
upheld.
now,
the
government
has
pointed
out
that
there
seems
to
a
shift
of
position
here.
i
may
say
there
maybe
a
shift
of
emphasis,
but
our
position
has
been
consistent.
in
the
court
below
on
behalf
of
the
america
plaintiffs,
as
i
say
saving
their
first
amendment
right,
we
took
the
position
very
much
similar
to
the
one
which
i
happen
to
have
taken
in
kent
against
dulles,
many
years
before,
arguing
that
the
statutes
on
their
face
as
applied
were
unconstitutional.
court
will
recall
that
it
took
a
more
limited
view
when
the
case
finally
came
up
and
said
that
the
statute
was
not
intended
to
apply,
because
of
the
first
amendment
rights
that
were
involved
to
the
situation
there
namely
the
denial
of
passports
for
political
reasons.
but
we
also
took
in
this
case
as
your
honors
will
see
from
our
complaint,
a
direct
attack
upon
the
attorney
general's
action
as
capricious
and
as
without
any
foundation.
we
did
not
give
up
either
point
when
we
opposed
the
appeal
here.
what
we
did
was
attempt
to
support
the
decision
on
a
narrower
ground
following
the
standard
practice
in
this
court
or
seeking
a
narrow
ground
if
it
could
be
done
in
declaring
a
statute
unconstitutional.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no,
the
district
court
didn't
pass
on
our
alternatives,
because
the
government
really
didn't
give
it
the
chance
to.
it
wasn't
our
fault,
it
was
the
government
that
said
through
an
affidavit
filed
by
assistant
us
attorney
baker,
this
matter
is
un-revealable.
we
decline
to
give
any
reason
to
the
district
court.
had
the
government
given
a
reason
to
the
district
court,
as
it
now
it
does
here,
i
think
the
district
court
would
have
then
said
the
action
taken
was
un-revealable.
but
our
rights
should
not
be
fought
for
two
years
later
after
the
litigation
began,
because
they
decided
to
stand
on
a
fundamental
principle
and
not
offer
any
reasons.
now,
let
me
point
out
the
shift
of
positions
taken
by
the
government,
not
because
they
are
inconsistent,
but
because
as
we
have
done
in
changes
of
emphasis,
the
government
has
had
a
perfect
right
to
do
it,
but
they
do
bear
a
relationship,
because
on
each
one
they
pose
a
proposition
upon
which
we
take
issue.
in
the
district
court
as
i
indicated
before
the
government
said
it
had
a
absolute
--
the
attorney
general
had
an
absolute,
an
un-revealable
exercise
of
discretion.
i
will
address
myself
to
that
shortly.
in
the
main
brief
here,
bearing
in
mind
what
the
district
court
had
done
in
holding
the
statute
not
on
its
face,
but
as
applied
to
this
particular
academic
situation
invalid.
as
applied
here,
the
government
took
the
basic
position
that
the
exclusion
and
deportation
cases
were
exercised
of
the
sovereign
power
of
the
federal
government,
the
congress.
now,
if
we
had
that
statute
before,
and
if
we
were
not
able
to
give
as
we
think
we
now
have
been
able
to
give
an
alternative
constitutional
interpretation
to
the
statute
and
shift
the
emphasis
to
the
attorney
general's
violations
of
the
congressional
intent,
which
i
should
try
to
establish
and
shift
the
statute
to
a
position
which
the
attorney
general
has
acted
arbitrarily
regardless
of
statutory
intent
in
denying
the
american
citizens
access
to
dr.
mandel
here
for
these
academic
discussions.
now
let's
say
that
even
a
statute
of
this
kind
for
the
reasons
indicated
by
the
court
below
and
in
the
o'brian
case
would
be
invalid.
i
would
then
argue
that
there
is
no
substantial
legitimate
governmental
interest
in
excluding
a
person
of
dr.
mandel's
economic
and
philosophical
views.
we
are
not
dealing
here
remember
with
(a)27
category.
we
are
not
dealing
which
are
the
people
who
are
absolutely
forbidden.
we
are
not
dealing
with
the
(a)29
category
which
deals
with
people
who
violate
laws.
we
are
dealing
with
(a)27
d
and
g.
we
aren't
dealing
with
the
other
(a)27
categories
of
those
people
whom
congress
considered
more
activist.
then
we
present
the
former
member
of
communist
party.
i
would
then
argue
that
this
category
of
persons
should
not
be
prevented
from
meeting
with
american
academicians,
universities
where
no
substantial
interest
of
the
government
is
shown
and
under
the
o'brien
case
involving
the
destruction
of
draft
card
as
the
court
remember.
the
court
did
set
forth
certain
tests,
and
one
of
them
was
that
there
must
be
a
predominating
government
interest,
the
otherwise
the
effect
--
the
court
raised
the
question
of
whether
the
effect
was
direct
or
incidental
to
first
amendment
rights.
then
came
the
question
of
the
least
restricted
means.
the
test
referred
to
in
shelton,
but
used
in
other
words
namely,
whether
it's
essential
to
a
governmental
interest
in
o'brien.
now,
when
the
government
filed
its
brief,
its
reply
brief
here
which
i
recited
and
probably
some
members
of
the
court
had
not
yet
received.
the
government
then
went
back,
not
possibly
as
a
result
of
our
briefs,
and
i
am
not
complaining,
went
back
to
the
original
assertion
which
it
had
made
in
the
district
court
of
an
unlimited
and
un-reviewable
exercise
of
executive
discretion.
except
it
did
one
more
thing
as
a
matter
of
precaution
which
it
didn't
do
in
the
district
court,
it
gave
a
reason.
the
reason
they
flagrant
abuse
of
dr.
mandel's
1968
trip
which
i
think
the
court
will
realize
is
superficial
and
not
agreed
to
by
the
state
department
and
persisted
in
by
the
government
is
really
all
i
have
to
do
is
say
it's
a
case
of
bureaucratic,
lower
bureaucratic
stubbornness.
and,
as
i
say
bureaucratic
stubbornness,
because
there
is
no
foundation
for
the
action,
for
the
argument
now
made
by
the
attorney
general
that
would
happen
in
1968,
namely
the
fact
that
at
a
cocktail
party
that
dr.
mandel
attended
in
which
an
event
occurred
at
the
end
in
which
he
had
nothing
to
do
namely
the
selling
the
postage
for
french
students.
this
is
basically
the
flagrant
abuse
that
is
relied
on
by
the
attorney
general
in
this
case.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
think
they
are
they
are
quite
similar
powers.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
think
it
has
been
supported,
but
in
no
case
has
been
supported
where
the
court
has
found.
i
refer
to
jay
against
boyd
and
hintopoulos
where
there
has
been
a)
arbitrary
action
on
the
party
of
attorney
general
which
we
think
the
court
will
easily
find
here,
and
b)
where
the
first
amendment
rights
of
american
citizens
are
involved.
that's
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
began
in
this
case
by
conceding
that
the
alien's
rights
are
not
involved,
they
don't
have
the
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
think
it
it
did
your
honor,
but
i
think
it
found
that
as
a
practical
matter
there
was
no
arbitrary
action
on
the
part
of
the
attorney
general.
in
other
words,
the
reasons
it
gave
for
withholding
information
were
considered
sufficient.
and
there
is
always
in
a
whole
line
of
cases
beginning
with
chinese
exclusion
all
the
way
down
to
harisiades
and
so
forth,
a
statement
of
the
very
broad
powers
of
congress.
the
question
however
is,
whether
there
is
in
any
area
an
unlimited
executive
power,
something
we
address
ourselves
to
in
our
brief,
or
even
an
unlimited
congressional
power.
i
would
wonder
for
example,
although
i
had
intended
to
turn
to
this
determining
in
analyzing
the
executive's
action;
whether
a
congressional
statute
which
said
that
a
person
who
was
not
in
an
activist
class,
but
is
a
celebrated
economic,
the
economist
in
lots
of
school.
if
congress
had
passed
a
statute
saying
that
the
entry
into
the
united
states
for
a
brief
visit
of
such
a
person
for
the
purpose
of
attending
an
academic
meeting
with
professor
richard
falk
of
princeton
would
be
forbidden,
because
professor
falk
has
written
as
one
of
the
editors
of
american
journal
of
international
law.
articles
against
our
opposition,
opposition
in
the
vietnam
war.
is
it
conceivable
that
such
a
statute
despite
the
plenary
power
would
not
be
stricken
down
and
recognizes
an
violation
of
first
amendment
rights
of
professor
falk
and
i
don't
want
to
go
into
examples,
but
i
would
rather
move
into
the
questions
which
i
am
next
addressing
myself
to.
that
is
the
statute
itself
and
is
it
acceptable
of
constitutional
construction
which
would
not
give
the
vast
powers
to
the
attorney
general
suggested
and
which
in
fact
challenges
those
vast
powers.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
think
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
distinguish
any
case
and
i
am
not
to
be
familiar
with
that
particular
problem.
although,
i
know
i
have
been
involved
in
some
litigation
which
may
touch
on
that.
those
don't
involve
the
first
amendment
rights
of
america.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
exactly,
in
other
words
in
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
precisely,
i
am
relying
specifically
upon
three
lines
of
decisions
which
this
court
has
handed
down.
the
first
is
the
recognition
in
shelton
against
tucker
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
concurring
opinion
and
mr.
justice
harlan
in
sweezy.
the
special
role
of
the
university.
i
am
warned
against
being
a
leadist
(ph)
here
by
my
colleagues,
but
the
fact
is
that
the
university
is
very
important.
i
include
schools
as
well,
in
terms
of
our
democratic
system.
the
second
principle,
i
rely
upon
is
a
line
of
decisions
which
range
--
i
can't
go
back
much
further
for
the
moment
in
de
jonge
against
oregon
in
going
up
to
new
york
times
against
sullivan
and
of
course
the
red
lion
case
on
which
i
rely
specifically.
and
that
line
relates
to
what
maybe
a
cliché,
but
if
so
it's
a
fundamental
one.
namely,
the
relationship
of
the
first
amendment
to
the
sovereignty
of
the
people.
as
opposed
to
the
governmental
sovereignty,
sovereign
rights
which
he
here
claims.
and
the
third
line
suggested,
i
think
a
few
minutes
ago,
is
a
line
of
the
right
to
know
which
began
at
least
within
my
memory
in
martin
against
struthers
and
moved
into
the
lamont
case
which
again
involved
i
thought
a
very
great
powerful
power
of
the
government
to
refuse
the
entry
of
communist
material.
but
which
the
court
held
referred
specifically
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
concurring
opinion
i
believe
there,
that
we
were
dealing
again,
not
with
the
rights
of
the
communist
who
were
sending
literature,
but
we
were
dealing
with
the
rights
of
the
receiver
and
i
distinguish
this
case
from
the
cases
which
involved
foreign
monies
coming
here
or
monies
going
to
abroad
or
schilling
against
rogers
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act
cases.
i
am
dealing
exclusively
with
the
question
of
the
first
amendment
rights
of
americans.
now,
what
the
government
says
in
response
is
that
it
has
a
right
to
be
arbitrary.
the
executive
says,
because
it
says
congress
has
given
it
this
power.
before
i
turn
again
to
the
congressional
power,
let
me
say
that
i
think
another
principle,
the
court
has
laid
down
in
stovall
and
in
(inaudible)
and
in
red
lion
is
that
the
government
cannot
be
arbitrary
and
i
don't
have
before
me,
the
precise
quotation
where
mr.
justice
white
made
some
reference
to
the
limitations
upon
the
bureaucratic
irresponsibility.
it's
a
very
rough
paraphrase
to
us.
the
question
however
is
that
congress
intends
to
give
this
power
to
the
attorney
general.
now,
the
government
has
said
that
the
statute
is
read
in
the
way
indicated.
let
me
add
to
the
construction
of
the
statue
that
there
are
two
kinds
of
persons
involved
in
ineligibility,
a
political
ineligibility
primarily.
the
first
is
a
category
on
which
congress
has
passed
the
complete
ban;
that's
the
(a)28
it's
(a)27,
the
(a)28
and
the
section
f
where
the
president
has
the
power
to
declare
people
inadmissible.
the
second
this
is
(a)27
category
that
we
are
dealing
here.
and
particularly,
the
(a)27
d
and
g.
now,
the
question
is
did
congress
intend
to
give
unlimited
power
to
the
attorney
general
or
is
there
some
standard
particularly
in
the
light
of
the
first
amendment
situation
to
which
we
are
directing
ourselves
here,
namely
the
american
academic
situation.
are
there
any
limitations
at
all?
well,
they
can
be
found
not
in
the
statutory
language,
but
they
can
be
found
in
two
or
three
reports
of
congress
cited
by
us
and
by
the
government
in
our
briefs
which
your
honors
will
see.
in
which
the
public
interest,
admittedly
a
difficult
concept,
but
i
am
sure
applied
very
often,
if
the
field
is
not
relating
to
the
first
amendment,
in
which
congress
stated
that
it
was
in
the
public
interest
that
the
attorney
general
exercised
his
discretionary
power.
the
alternative
was
also
humanity
which
i
am
not
suggesting
to
involve
here
in
main
reasons.
now
in
addition
to
that
the
statistics
which
i
think
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out
are
really
significant,
because
in
1969,
for
example,
the
critical
year
here,
at
least
for
the
purpose
of
this
case
about
5,000
recommendations
were
made
by
american
council
abroad
for
the
most
part
to
the
department
of
justice.
and
that
very
important
administrative
practice
showed
that
only
nine
applications
were
denied
by
the
attorney
general
and
our
guess,
no
basis
and
the
government
doesn't
have
the
facts
that
those
nine
were
probably
not
cases;
probably
not
cases
in
which
the
secretary
of
state
himself
or
the
persons
important
to
the
bureau
security
council
affairs.
so
it
was
important
that
dr.
mandel
come
here
and
probably
cases
where
only
council
is
involved
and
probably
cases
where
you
had
political
activist
school.
now
i
have
jumped
to
the
legal
analysis
here
and
to
the
administrative
implementation
urging
again
that
the
court
take
a
narrow
view
of
the
powers
given
here
in
order
to
avoid
constitutional
problem,
but
i
don't
want
to
miss
the
critical
facts,
which
as
usual
one
misses
when
he
meets
the
government's
argument
on
the
law.
the
critical
facts
are
that
the
start
here
is
not
from
mandel
who
wanted
to
come
here.
he
celebrated
and
love
to
live
in
europe
and
to
receive
the
respect
of
other
universities.
dr.
mandel
who
came
here
in
1968
and
delivered
lectures
before
30
american
universities
including
princeton,
was
invited
in
1969
to
debate
professor
galbraith
of
harvard
at
stanford
university
with
the
administration's
approval.
and
then
followed
six
other
invitations
--
and
many
other
invitations
of
which
he
accepted
six,
and
where
the
americans
wanted
him,
not
he
who
wanted
come
here
particularly.
now,
the
applications
were
denied
and
it
turns
out
if
i
could
short-circuit
it,
the
applications
were
denied
because
of
this
assumption
that
somehow
rather
he
had
technically
violated
the
conditions
of
his
coming
in
earlier.
but
the
american
council
and
the
state
department
recognized
that
this
was
an
error
on
their
part.
they
had
not
told
him
when
they
gave
him
the
visas
that
he
was
politically
ineligible
and
therefore
conditions
with
entry
of
acts.
he
had
assumed
that
he
was
eligible
as
he
had
the
american
academicians.
and
it
was
only
because
he
came
in
not
as
an
eligible,
but
one
whose
eligibility
was
weighed
that
these
conditions
which
are
really
very
technical
and
hardly
an
important
state
interest
were
suggested
by
the
american
council
for
the
first
time,
as
a
reason
for
excluding
dr.
mandel
and
not
making
a
recommendations
after
his
stay.
i
was
then
communicated
with,
not
by
dr.
mandel,
i
am
not
a
marxist,
we
are
obviously
friends.
i
was
communicated
by
the
american
academic
community
which
said
we
want
this
man
here
and
we
want
to
debate
with
him.
we
want
to
engage
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
oh,
i
can
clear.
i
think
it
is
very
important
that
the
first
amendment
rights
of
the
academicians
involved
here,
i
don't
question
that
at
all
and
i
wouldn't
just
here
--.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
remember
your
honor
--
mr.
chief
justice,
i
warned
myself
about
leaders
and
i
am
not
sure.
i
do
think
however
that
the
importance
of
education,
whether
at
schools
or
universities
as
such
that
the
court
will
treat
that
aspect
very
often,
how
you
should
make
the
inception,
will
treat
that
aspect
differently
than
it
we
will
treat
for
example
dr.
mandel's
desire
to
deliver
a
talk
to
an
unlimited
american
audience
who
had
not
invited
him
to
come
here.
and
in
that
sense,
i
think
there
are
gradations,
as
we
saw
in
the
last
several
case
there,
gradations
of
rights
of
access
to
buildings
for
the
labor
reasons
and
gradations
of
first
amendment
rights,
at
least
each
case
must
be
considered
on
its
own.
now,
the
attorney
general
here
in
his
action
we
think
therefore
in
the
light
of
what
i
have
said
is
a
very
sparse
congressional
history
but
a
very
satisfactory
administrative
practice.
we
think
is
acted
arbitrarily
and
in
violation
of
the
first
amendment
as
well
as
in
violation
of
a
public
interest
concept
and
is
because
your
honors
will
recall
reading
the
brief,
what
i
have
not
said
that
the
department
of
state
in
washington;
when
i
approached
them
said
representing
the
academicians,
i
want
a
meeting
between
the
university
professors
and
you,
writing
to
mr.
elliot
richardson
then
on
the
secretary
of
state,
i
had
known
of
his
interest,
the
freedom
of
speech
from
his
articles
in
the
harvard
law
review
many
years
ago
on
the
dennis
case.
i
thought
he
was
a
right
man
to
write
to.
and
the
response
was
that
we
do
recognize
that
this
may
have
been
an
error,
a
misunderstanding
between
dr.
mandel
and
ourselves.
we
do
recognize
the
importance
of
the
academic
community
and
its
interest
in
the
thing,
and
finally
came
the
recommendation
of
the
secretary
of
the
state.
yes,
in
the
interest
of
freedom
of
speech
and
freedom
of
opinion
dr.
mandel
should
be
admitted
and
the
answer
of
the
attorney
general
was,
no,
and
as
your
honor
has
seen
me
tracing
it,
no
for
no
reason;
now
no
for
a
reason.
now
all
of
these
cases
with
respect
to
reviewability
that
is
suggested
by
the
attorney
general.
on
that
cases
in
which
the
court
has
denied
justiciability,
that
cases
in
which
the
court
has
weighed
the
factors,
war
power
o'brien
and
(inaudible).
one
for
the
individual,
the
other
against
the
individual.
foreign
policies
zemel
and
that
was
very
real.
i
argued
zemel;
i
radically
lost,
but
i
argued
zemel
here
and
i
urged
the
first
amendment
rights
on
the
part
of
zemel
being,
even
though
the
matter
was
phrased
in
terms
of
its
individual
curiosity
to
see
what
would
happen
in
cuba.
but
they
were
very
strong
foreign
policy
reasons
urged
by
the
government
before
this
court,
evaluated
by
this
court
and
upheld
by
the
court.
is
this
tactical
violation
to
being
at
a
cocktail
party
be
equivalent
of
our
relations
with
cuba
and
(inaudible)
in
cuba.
in
the
field
of
national
security
again
harisiades
and
all
of
these
cases
received
very
careful
analysis
in
the
court
and
the
court
that
divided
of
course
in
many
of
those
cases.
even
in
the
field
of
immigration
as
i
indicated
before,
the
government
is
quite
right
in
citing
this
mr.
justice
powell's
one
line
statement
of
that
fact
that
it's
a
matter
of
race,
but
quite
i
will
call
delinquent
in
error
in
failing
to
give
his
concluding
line
that
they
did
not
regard
the
considerations
involved
there
as
being
arbitrary
and
unreasonable
and
capricious
and
so
we
now
come
down
to
the
conclusion
of
our
problem
here;
a)
no
reason
given
in
the
court
below,
b)
no
foundation
in
fact
suggested
and
the
use
of
the
word
'flagrant
abuse'
is
really
a
hyperbole
which
i
regret
to
say
that
government
adopted
from
their
earlier
letter
sent
by
one
of
the
immigration
officials.
we
have
here
a
situation
where
the
opinion
of
the
secretary
of
state
which
certainly
indicates
that
foreign
relations
are
not
affected.
because
if
dr.
mandel
for
example
had
been,
let
us
say
at
the
moment,
a
soviet
marxist,
and
soviets
were
not
allowing
our
economist
to
come
in.
or
even
if
we
had
a
position
of
opposition
to
the
soviet
government
which
we
wanted
to
demonstrate,
then
this
court
would
have
to
weigh
the
question,
whether
the
first
amendment
rights
of
the
academicians
in
the
universities
overbalance
this
or
it
doesn't,
the
state
department's
decision.
and
i
suspect
it
would
come
out
against
the
universities
in
such
a
case.
but
we
have
here
a
statement
that
on
the
history
i
have
given
you,
in
other
words
attacking
the
statute
and
not
just
as
written,
but
as
applied.
we
are
attacking
and
we
attacked
in
our
complaint
the
action
of
the
attorney
general
is
frivolous
and
is
unreasonable
and
without
foundation.
this
is
real
frivolity.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
don't
think
your
honor.
i
think
each
case
is
going
to
depend
in
the
end
and
somewhat
you
had
said
earlier
on
one
of
the
occasion
on
its
own
facts.
we
have
here
a
case
of
scholarly
discussion
at
american
universities
recognized
by
those
universities
important
for
the
education
of
those
people.
we
don't
have
ad
hoc
group
saying
either
sympathetic,
but
not
sympathetic
to
dr.
mandel,
we
would
like
to
hear
you.
we
have
the
most
eminent
professors
and
the
most
eminent
universities
who
feel
that
it's
important
as
i
think
we
all
do,
important
that;
that
there
be
a
counter
discussion,
the
discussion
of
issues
here.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
then
i
think
i
would
be
faced
with
an
attack
on
the
statute
and
i
would
have
a
harder
burden,
but
i
would
attack
the
statute.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
if
the
attorney
general
had
said
i
am
following
the
statute
strictly
--
well,
i
don't
think
the
attorney
general
could
do
that.
the
attorney
general
in
each
case
is
exercising
discretion.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
think
the
statement
--
the
problem
you
are
posing
mr.
justice
is
one
in
which
we
are
faced
with
where
the
statute
says,
there
is
an
absolute
ban;
and
that
would
place
a
burden
on
me
and
i
would
have
to
meet
it
is
for
court
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
it
does
and
i
would
challenge
that,
but
i
don't
think
that
i
have
to
challenge
that.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
think
that
would
be
improper,
because
congress
intended
the
attorney
general
exercised
the
discretion
with
respect
to
the
views
also.
congress
didn't
say
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
it
depends
on
how
it's
exercised.
i
think
the
attorney
general
in
each
one
of
these
cases
does
exercise
discretion,
i
would
assume
that
so
in
good
faith.
now,
i
think
all
of
our
situation
as
i
think
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
but
only
purposes
of
winning.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
for
the
other
purpose
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no,
i
would
not
say
that.
well,
the
question
of
what
is
subject
judicial
review
and
when
the
courts
will
overrule
the
attorney
general
is
another
problem
almost
everything
is
subject
to
judicial
review
in
this
country,
but
tremendous
deference
is
obviously
paid
to
the
views
of
congress
and
even
to
the
attorney
general.
i
would
say
that
given
a
situation
where
the
attorney
general
is
given
a
reason,
and
sometimes
giving
a
reason
could
be
worse
than
not
giving
a
reason.
and
given
a
reason
which
this
court
can
say,
is
absolutely
absurd,
it's
frivolous.
and
if
the
attorney
general
for
example
had
given
a
reason
that
i
had
suggest,
there
another
one,
that
professor
(inaudible)
would
recall
him
is
a
rather
conservative
at
least
by
dr.
mandel's
standards,
professor
of
economics
had
written
books
criticizing
our
american
economic
policy,
and
he
wanted
dr.
mandel
in
his
university
in
the
new
school
of
social
research.
he
wanted
dr.
mandel
to
come
here.
it
would
be
frivolous
and
it
would
be
unreasonable,
it
would
be
in
violation
of
the
first
amendment
rights
to
deny
his
right
to
access
to
dr.
mandel.
i
don't
think
we
have
to
take
a
lot
of
whole
statute,
and
particularly
we
will
need
to
do
so.
i
urged
in
the
court
below.
i
don't
think
we
have
to
do
so,
if
we
can
say
a;
either
that
the
attorney
general's
position
is
arbitrary
and
unreasonable
one,
and
that
this
court
have
never
upheld
a
decision
which
it
said
was
unreasonable
and
arbitrary
by
the
executive
branch,
or
,
we
say
congress
intended
there
be
some
standards
here,
and
that
one
of
the
things
congress
did
not
intend
is
that,
because
of
what
i
call
simply
bureaucratic
stubbornness,
the
rights
of
the
american
academic
community
should
be
rejected.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
think
your
honor
is
correct,
that
the
court
has
never
excluded
aliens.
but
i
will
say
that
in
no
case,
in
the
history
of
this
court
including
the
turner
case,
the
famous
amicus
case
argued
by
clarence
darrow
and
edgar
lee
masters
in
this
court.
in
no
case
has
it
been
the
first
amendment
rights
of
the
american
citizens
that
was
alleged.
they
were
never
the
plaintiffs,
poor
mr.
turner.
i
guess
it
was
turner,
they
confuse
with
that
turner
too.
poor
mr.
turner
was
a
man
who
was
asserting
as
an
alien
his
first
amendment
rights.
well,
it's
a
long
time,
it's
pretty
late.
i
would
like
to
re-argue
turner
against
williams,
but
it's
too
late,
and
if
clarence
darrow
failed,
i
would
certainly
fail.
