mr.
george
f.
kugler,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
here
as
amicus
to
support
the
position
of
the
appellee,
state
crime
investigation
commission
of
new
jersey
and
the
24
states
join
in
views
expressed
in
our
brief.
it
should
be
noted
that
the
states
still
bear
the
primary
responsibility
for
enforcement
of
the
criminal
law.
most
crimes
are
certainly
matters
of
local
concern.
these
immunity
statutes
have
been
extremely
important
part
of
our
rights
in
fighting
crime
particularly,
organized
crime
and
official
corruption.
one
of
the
most
important
powers
of
any
government
in
preventing
the
infiltration
of
crime
in
that
government
is
the
power
to
compel
citizens
to
testify
in
court
before
grand
jury
or
agencies
such
as
the
state
crime
investigation
commission.
on
the
other
hand,
we
recognized
that
one
of
the
most
important
privileges
of
any
citizen
is
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self
incrimination.
obviously,
there
must
be
a
balance
struck
between
the
power
on
the
one
hand
and
compel
a
witness
to
testify
in
court,
and
the
privilege
on
the
other
that
anything
he
says
may
not
be
use
against
him.
it
seems
to
me
that
the--
of
course,
it
all
started
in
counselmen
and
whether
you
read
that
case
as
i
do,
merely
holding
that
the
statute
in
that
case
was
defective
because
it
did
not
provide
proofs
immunity
in
addition
to
use
immunity,
certainly,
it
must
be
said
in
all
candor
that
as
a
result
of
the
equivocal
language
in
that
case
and
the
decision
of
brown
versus
walker
case
right
after
it,
in
which
four
justices
dissenting
and
indeed
said
that
no
immunity
statutes
are
constitutional.
there
arose
in
the
law
and
in
the
cases
from
this
court
a
many
statements
to
the
effect
that
transactional
immunity
was
the
only
viable
way
to
compel
a
witness
to
testify.
i
think
the
first
crack
in
the
dyke
if
i
may
respectfully
suggest
it
came
in
the
three
cases
of
garidi,
gardener
and
the
sanitation
workers
case,
and
these
cases
have
been
tremendously
helpful
to
the
states
in
official
corruption
and
indeed
in
calling
before
official
bodies
or
just
the
boss
themselves
in
a
particular
community
and
requiring
public
officials
under
duress
of
losing
their
jobs,
explaining
any
particular
criminal
conduct
that
might
come
to
the
attention
of
the
authorities.
this
court
has
held
i
believe
and
has
stated
that
only
use
plus
proofs
immunity
is
necessary
as
a
result
of
any
testimony
they
give
and
indeed
if
they
refused
to
explain
their
activities,
they
maybe
fired.
the
next
crack
in
the
dike,
if
the
court
please,
i
would
say
in
the
unanimous
decision
of
murphy
versus
the
waterfront
commission.
personally,
i
fail
to
take
the
intellectual
step
of
differentiating
the
rule
in
murphy
which
applies
inter-jurisdictionally,
differentiate
that
from
most
cases
which
would
indicate
a
different
rule
as
required
in
traft
jurisdictionally
and
that
is
in
the
case
where
this
compelling
state
also
is
prosecuting
state.
to
answer
the
question
of
mr.
justice
white,
i
think,
they
are
very
practical
considerations
of
the
states
that
are
faced
within,
this
very
case
and
zicarelli,
we
had
at
least
five
indictments
and
maybe
six,
i
am
not
sure
and
three
of
them
have
been
already
tried
and
he
has
been
convicted.
at
the
time,
the
sci
called
him
before
them
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
sci
would
have
gone
into
the
matters
contained
in
those
indictments.
but
we
had
clearly
intendant
evidence.
we
were
not
worried
about
prosecuting
zicarelli
on
those
cases.
we
probed
them
under
any
test,
we
could
prove
that
our
evidence
was
independent.
however,
we
would
felt
much
more
comforted
as
it
has
been
if
we
were
sure
of
our
position
that
use
plus
proofs
has
been
constitutional.
as
the
statute
provides,
i
have
to
say
to
the
court
that
even
though
we
have
had
a
use
plus
proofs
immunity
statute
for
sometime
in
several
sectors
of
new
jersey,
we
have
used
it
generally
for
the
reason
that
we
were
certainly
weren't
sure
of
what
constitutional
ramifications
were.
under
the
scheme
of
things,
the
legislature
has
ordained
that
there
shall
be
a
state
crime
investigation
commission.
in
my
opinion,
it
was
absolutely
necessary.
they
did
not
make
the
attorney
general
counsel
for
that
commission,
they
said
in
fact
the
state
crime
investigation
commission
can
go
out
and
get
a
compelled
testimony
by
a
court
order
without
the
permission
of
the
attorney
general,
to
be
sure,
they
must
get
me
24
hours
notice.
indeed
in
a
very
relevant
investigation
of
theirs,
they
could
conceivably
destroy
already
made
prosecution
of
ours.
in
new
jersey,
the
witness
immunity
statute
intra-jurisdictionally,
that
is
the
federal
versus
the
state
has
been
extremely
affected.
and
in
many
cases
in
which
the
federal
government
has
recently
got
indictment.
unfortunately,
we
have
run
a
file
of
each
other
in
several
instances
and
some
of
the
cases
that
we
have
ready
to
go
to
trial
may
have
been
affected
by
that
prosecution.
now,
i
suggest
to
you
that
most
all
of
the
states
have
little
systems
of
federalism,
if
you
will.
with
the
exemption
of
rhode
island
in
delaware
where
all
the
prosecution
is
done
at
one
level.
certainly,
new
jersey
has
21
county
prosecutors,
the
attorney
general’s
office,
and
the
sci
and
also
that
cities
are
empowered
to
conduct
investigation.
with
450
some
police
forces,
it
is
very
difficult
to
keep
from
stepping
on
each
other’s
toes
with
all
kinds
of
cooperation.
and
therefore,
if
indeed
use
plus
proofs
immunity
is
constitutionally
sound
then
it
seems
to
me,
that
is
the
practical
way
to
have
the
states
and
local
government
retain
their
respective
rights
to
use
this
very,
very
powerful
weapon
of
witness
immunity.
there
seems
to
be
a
feeling
that
the
states
cannot
handle
this
immunity
statute
that
is
too
rich
for
the
law
that
inadvertently
or
deliberately
compelled
testimony
will
be
misused
in
some
way
because
of
the
closed
cooperation
among
the
various
law
enforcement
agencies
in
the
state.
i
say
to
this
court
that
i
believe
the
states
can
use
it
effectively
and
constitutionally.
i
think,
for
instance,
the
picarelli
case
is
a
splendid
example
of
effective
use
of
the
witness
immunity
statute.
in
that
cases
as
the
court
knows,
the
individual
had
pled
guilty
to
beating
somebody
with
a
tire
arm.
the
prosecution
authorities
want
to
find
out
whether
he
was
hired
to
do
so,
and
they
called
the
man
before
that
court
having
all
ready
sufficient
and
dependent
evidence
to
prosecute
him
as
to
matter
of
fact,
he
had
pled
guilty.
and,
they
did
so
and
he
did
indicate
that
he
has
been
hired.
unfortunately,
he
then
disclosed
individual
that
hire
him.
but
he
could
had
and
it
would
have
been
effective
use
and
there
is
no
reason
under
the
constitution
that
he
should
he
not
have
been
prosecuted.
i
believe
that
a
simple
task
in
handling
this
weapon
in
this
day,
whenever
you
want
indeed
has
counsel,
unlike
in
the
days
of
counsel
man
and
the
liberal
discovery
rules
in
all
jurisdiction
neither
constitutionally
required
or
by
rule
of
court,
i
believe
that
the
defense
counsel
and
will
they
clear
record
of
what
is
been
compel
can
sort
out
whether
or
not
your
convicting
a
man
from
his
own
lips
or
the
proof’s
thereof.
now,
i
believe
that
the
test
should
be
the
burden
of
beyond
the
state,
and
that—the
test
should
be
that
if
the
defendant
had
remain
in
silence,
he
would
not
of
been
indicted
or
not
had
been
convicted
as
the
case
might
do
it.
this
task
was
originally
suggested
in
counsel,
and
i
believe
that
is
a
sound
task
and
i
believe
the
courts
can
handle
it
without
violating
anybody’s
constitutional
rights.
i
urge
this
court
to
overrule
counsel
man
if
necessarily,
and
stick
with
the
doctrine
of
the
murphy
case
and
apply
it
inter
jurisdictionally
and
i
think
in
that
way,
we
will
have
much
more
effective
law
enforcement
and
indeed
constitutional
law
enforcement.
thank
you.

might
do
it.
this
task
was
originally
suggested
in
counsel,
and
i
believe
that
is
a
sound
task
and
i
believe
the
courts
can
handle
it
without
violating
anybody’s
constitutional
rights.
i
urge
this
court
to
overrule
counsel
man
if
necessarily,
and
stick
with
the
doctrine
of
the
murphy
case
and
apply
it
inter
jurisdictionally
and
i
think
in
that
way,
we
will
have
much
more
effective
law
enforcement
and
indeed
constitutional
law
enforcement.
thank
you.
