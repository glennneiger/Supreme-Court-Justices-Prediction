did
we
state
the
judgment
in
that
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
we
stated
the
judgment
in
that
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
depends
on
the
prosecutor?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
goes
to
constitutionality
of
immunity
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
goes
to
the
constitutionality
of
any
immunity
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes?
justice
byron
r.
white
tell
me
why
does
not
new
jersey
grand
absolute
immunity?
why
does
new
jersey
have
kind
of
a
statute
that
does
grant
transactional
immunity?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
it
is
an
extravagant
--
on
the
one
hand
that
it
is
an
extravagant
application
of
the
fifth
amendment
that
on
the
other
hand
you
seem
to
say
that
use
immunity
is
even
more
extravagant?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree.
yes,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
suggesting
that
new
jersey
limits
its
statute
to
use
immunity
because
it
could
conceive
of
situations
where
it
would
like
to
be
able
to
prosecute,
the
gentlemen
may
have
had
before
the
grand
jury
for
the
very
crime
that
which
he
is
testified.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
isn't
that
the
only
thing
you
are
protecting.
the
only
state
interest
you
are
protecting
is
the
right
to
prosecute
again
or
the
right
to
prosecute
at
some
time,
in
some
circumstances
for
the
very
crime
of
that
which
you
would
ask
him
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
with
a
absolute
immunity
statute,
you
can
get
your
evidence
of
the
crimes
that
you
want
to
prosecute
for,
but
you
want
to
retain
the
right
to
prosecute
this
man
for
the
very
crime
about
which
you
would
ask
him
questions?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
that
that
possibility
is
significant
enough
to
warrant
to
come
and
clear
to
this
court
arguing
for
its
retention?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it
is
a
real
possibility
that
he
maybe
prosecuted
--
justice
byron
r.
white
for
the
very
crime
about
what
he
has
been
interrogated.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
substantial
enough
anyway
for
new
jersey
to
have
made
this
choice
and
the
defendant
in
this
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
some
situations
--
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
new
jersey
would
be
better
off
with
an
absolute
immunity
statute
than
with
the
use
immunity
statute.
that
is
what
i
gathered
you
said
moment
ago
that
the
gentleman
being
interrogated
might
even
be
--
the
use
immunity
what
would
be
advantageous
to
him
as
compared
with
transactional
immunity.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
am
just
glad
--
the
real
purpose
of
my
question
is
really
to
inquire
about
what
new
jersey's
estimate
is
that
the
actual
importance
of
this
issue
in
terms
of
--
how
often
will
it
come
up.
do
you
think
it
really
makes
the
difference
to
new
jersey,
to
the
interest
of
state
of
new
jersey
in
just
lots
of
instances?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
so,
you
are
saying
that
there
is
substantial
enough
chance
to
what
it
prosecutes
say
--mr.
zicarelli
for
the
questions,
for
the
crime
about
which
you
have
been
asking
him
questions?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
that
you
could
have
done
that
with
the
transactional
immunity?
justice
byron
r.
white
right,
so
again
i
say
you
want
to
retain
the
possibility
of
being
able
to
prosecute
mr.
zicarelli
on
independent
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
okay.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
differently
say
than
a
prosecutor
in
some
other
county
of
new
jersey?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
because
it
happens
to
be
part
of
the
same
phase,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
only
there
is
a
prosecutor
in
the
other
county?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
you
are
saying
--
you
are
saying
that
if
the
district
attorney
in
san
francisco,
all
of
the
witness
before
a
grand
jury,
and
that
answers
the
question,
that
if
he
gives
him
immunity,
that
immunity
must
be
absolute
--
justice
byron
r.
white
transactional
immunity,
and
that
a
prosecutor
in
los
angeles
is
in
great
secrecy,
also
developing
a
case.
it
has
a
case
against
the
gentlemen
who
is
being
questioned
in
san
francisco.
may
not
go
forward
with
its
independent
case,
the
prosecutor
in
los
angeles
may
not.
although,
the
prosecutor
in
las
vegas
or
the
prosecutor
in
washington
may
go
forward
with
it
as
long
as
he
can
prove
an
independent
source.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
your
answer
is
yes
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wish
a
treat
the
prosecutor
in
los
angeles
differently
than
the
prosecutor
in
washington?
justice
byron
r.
white
neither
did
the
prosecutor
in
los
angeles
calling
in,
unlike
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then—
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
let
us
say
the
prosecutor
in
san
francisco
would
be
bounded,
what
about
the
prosecutor
in
los
angeles?
justice
byron
r.
white
both
are
in
the
same
state,
he
was
bound
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
the
different
prosecution?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
we
state
the
judgment
in
that
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
we
stated
the
judgment
in
that
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
depends
on
the
prosecutor?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
goes
to

of
immunity
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
goes
to
the

of

justice
byron

white
yes?
justice

tell
me
why
does
not
new
