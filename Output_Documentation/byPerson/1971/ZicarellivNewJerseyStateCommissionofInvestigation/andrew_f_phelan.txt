mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
i
please
the
court.
it
is
the
appellant's
contention
here
this
morning
that
he
has
been
incarcerated
on
the
new
jersey
state
commission
of
investigation,
the
immunity
statute,
and
he
has
been
in
constituted,
incarcerated
under
a
provision
which
is
unconstitutional.
a
long
line
of
cases,
this
court
have
held
that
an
immunity
statute
maybe
valid.
i
submit
to
you
and
my
further
record
will
state
that
the
commission
statute
is
and
was
designed
to
be
a
use
plus
proof
statute.
it
was
so
designed
to
attempt
to
reach
a
particular
problem
that
existed
in
the
state
of
new
jersey
in
the
period
of
spring
of
1968,
and
was
so
found
to
exist
by
a
joint
legislative
committee
of
the
assembly
of
that
state.
now,
the
statute
itself
recognizes
that
in
order
for
a
immunity
statute
to
supplant
the
privilege
under
the
fifth
amendment
that
it
must
be
co-extensive
with
the
privilege
which
it
seeks
to
supplant.
it
must
never
put
the
individual
in
a
situation
in
which
he
would
be
in
worst
position
than
had
he
exercised
his
privilege
or
been
allowed
to
exercise
his
privilege.
now,
we
contend
that
this
statute
does
just
that.
the
fifth
amendment
says
“no
man
shall
be
compelled
in
a
criminal
case
to
be
a
witness
against
himself”.
our
statute
provides
after
appropriate
steps
of
due
process
within
the
commission
or
within
the
state
process,
that
individual
shall
not
have
any
of
the
testimony
or
the
evidence
or
evidence
derived
there
from
used
against
him
in
any
criminal
prosecution.
we
submit
that
under
these
circumstances,
the
individual
is
in
exactly
the
same
position
as
he
was
had
he
not
been
granted
the
immunity
following
his
claim
of
the
privilege.
now,
since,
course
counsel
in
1892,
which
considered
a
pure
use
statute.
i,
for
the
record
and
the
commission
for
the
record
and
i
feel
state
would
certainly
admit
that
a
pure
use
statute
alone
which
did
not
protect
against
the
use
of
derivative
evidence
must
be
unconstitutional.
it
completely
challenges
the
logic
and
reason
to
be
able
to
say
that
you
can
compel
a
man
to
answer
and
then
go
out
and
secure
evidence
on
the
basis
of
that
answer,
and
use
that
against
him.
by
the
same
token
in
the
brown
decision
some
four
years
later,
the
transactional
immunity
statute
or
the
absolute
immunity
statute,
which
i
believe
flowed
from
counselmen
and
perhaps
at
a
time
when
we
were
not
considering
the
middle
ground,
that
absolute
immunity
statute
was
upheld
and
that
granted
i
submit
a
much
broader
immunity,
that
which
the
fifth
amendment
does
require.
i
submit
also
that
it
when
utilized,
it
grants
a
gratuity
to
the
criminal
upon
who
seeks
to
exercise
it.
i
further
suggest
that
it
does
an
injustice
to
the
best
interest
of
the
people
themselves.
now,
in
that
middle
ground
then,
we
come
to
the
point
of
just
what
is
it,
that
the
fifth
amendment
will
require
of
an
immunity
statute
in
order
for
it
to
be
constitutional.
i
suggest
that
is
a
use
plus
proofs,
an
absolute
situation
whereby
once
you
compel
a
man
to
testify,
you
may
under
no
circumstances
use
anything.
and,
i
use
that
term
with
great
consideration.
anything
whatsoever
that
flows
there
from,
for
if
we
have
compelled
him
to
give
up
a
very
sacred
right,
self
incrimination
against
self
incrimination.
that
then
the
government
must
bear
the
burden
and
must
bear
the
duty,
and
a
very
heavy
duty
perhaps
it
should
be,
to
show
that
nothing
has
ever
been
used
against
that
individual
in
connection
with
any
future
prosecution.
now,
i
submit
that
under
such
a
rule
of
law
with
the
use
plus
proof
statute,
tied
in
with
a
heavy
burden
being
placed
upon
the
government
that
was
noted
in
note
18
of
the
murphy
decision,
that
the
burden
is
placed
upon
the
government
to
establish
independent
source
of
evidence.
that
the
individual
may
very
well
be
in
a
better
position
than
he
is
today
under
a
transactional
statute.
and
i
say
that
for
this
reason,
that
under
the
old
haikey
decision
in
1913,
that
the
individual
must
prove
as
an
affirmative
defense
that
that
transactional
immunity
statute
has
protected
him
against
a
subsequent
indictment.
i
would
submit
that
under
a
use
immunity
or
use
immunity
plus
proof
statute
that
the
burden
here
would
be
on
the
government.
now,
since
the
murphy
decision
--
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
the
use
plus
proof
--
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
i
believe
mr.
justice
white
that
use
immunity
alone
which
would
allow
the
government
or
the
people
thereafter
to
go
out
and
secure
evidence
based
upon
the
testimony
compelled
must
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
i
further
argue
that
a
transactional
or
an
absolute
immunity
is
too
broad,
is
that
it
gives
to
greater
gratuity
to
the
individual
who
seeks
to
utilize
that
privilege
and
then
forces
the
people
to
secure
the
absolute
--
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
i
do
not
suggest
here
that
they
would
like
to
prosecute.
in
our
situation
--
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
in
the
first
instance,
i
would
say
that
you
were
seeking
to
protect
the
individual
in
his
constitutional
rights.
in
the
second
instance,
i
would
say
that
you
were
protecting
the
public
interest
and
their
right
to
able
to
get
at
perhaps,
the
area
of
crimes
involving
involved
conspiracies
with
some
activities.
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
if
such
evidence
of
an
independent
nature
should
be
developed
either
in
a
different
jurisdiction
or
at
a
later
date.
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
absolutely
sir.
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
i
would
have
to
say
--
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
i
would
have
to
say
that
there
is
certainly
is
a
real
possibility
of
that
occurrence.
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
well,
if
i
may
could
just
draw
this
distinction
justice
white,
hours
of
the
state
commission
of
investigation,
we
are
purely
an
investigative
body.
we
have
absolutely
no
prosecutorial
responsibilities.
we
have
no
criminal
jurisdiction
whatsoever.
our
function
as
conceived
by
the
new
jersey
legislature,
was
with
a
broad
area
of
responsibility
to
determine
facts
which
would
then
allow
us
to
make
recommendations
to
the
legislature
for
perhaps
the
enactment
of
legislation
to
correct
a
problem
as
what
it
seen
to
exist.
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
i
suggested
that
perhaps
the
individual
might
be
in
a
better
position
because
with
the
use
plus
proofs,
the
burden
of
establishing,
the
relationship
would
be
on
the
government
and
on
the
people
that
return
the
indictment
whereas
now
it
is
my
understanding
of
the
law
that
with
the
transactional
grant
of
immunity
should
he
later
be
indicted
that
he
must
prove
that
as
an
affirmative
defense
in
the
defense
of
this
case.
that
was
my
sole
position
suggesting
that
he
might
be
at
a
better
position.
certainly,
i
think
that
if
our
statute
were
transactional
or
would
it
be
such
or
absolute,
we
would
not
be
here
today.
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
i
think
it
makes
a
very
substantial
difference
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
no,
i
am
not
suggesting
that
at
all
sir.
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
i
believe
that
under
the
circumstances
that
existed
in
new
jersey
in
1968,
that
there
was
a
sufficiently
severe
problem
to
warrant
the
enactment
of
the
statute
in
order
for
us
as
fact
finding
body,
to
secure
information
which
could
give
rise
to
testimony.
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
but
at
the
same
time,
we
would
then
have
been
granting
a
collective
immunity
to
mr.
zicarelli.
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
correct
sir.
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
with
the
burden
of
proof
being
placed
upon
the
government
should
any
indictment
ever
be
forth
coming.
now
then
--
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
the
extraordinary
situation,
well.
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
yes.
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
the
statute
is
still
in
effect
that—
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
in
the
spring
of
1968,
there
was
convened
in
new
jersey,
a
special
legislative
committee
which
found
that
at
time
a
serious
organized
crime
problem
did
exist
within
the
state.
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
the
commission
is
still
in
effect.
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
yes
sir,
it
is.
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
well,
we
hope
that
to
some
extent
the
problem
has
diminished.
we
do
recognize
that
--
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
i
would
frankly
hope
not,
because
if
the
use
plus
proof
immunity
statute
--
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
that
is
my
position
sir.
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
yes
sir.
now,
in
terms
of
protection
of
the
individual
since
1892
to
the
present
time
which
has
been
some
80
years.
there
has
been
developed
in
this
court
a
rule
of
law
and
a
body
of
law
which
did
not
existed
that
time.
and
to
that,
i
am
referring
to
the
exclusionary
rule
of
law
that
has
been
utilized
in
connection
with
the
fourth
amendment
cases,
under
unreasonable
search
and
seizures,
under
electronic
eavesdropping,
under
the
sixth
amendment,
under
the
right
to
counsel
and
coerced
confessions.
now,
this
body
of
law
did
not
exist,
and
was
not
available
for
the
court’s
consideration.
under
counselmen
nor
was
it
available
under
brown,
and
i
submit
that
this
court
has
now
developed
a
new
body
of
law
which
is
capable
and
is
absolutely
certain
of
protecting
the
rights
of
individual.
should
they
be
found
to
be
abridged
under
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
i
suggest
that
in
terms
of
the
fact
that
the
information
and
the
protection
which
might
be
secured
to
the
individual,
of
course,
that
information
is
always
in
the
hands
of
the
government.
it
was
in
the
hands
of
the
police
department
in
miranda
decision.
it
has
always
been
in
the
hands
of
the
government
and
the
electronics
eavesdropping
cases,
or
the
hands
of
somebody
else.
and
still
in
our
courts,
the
judiciary
throughout
this
country
has
found
it
capable
to
be
able
to
protect
the
right
of
each
and
every
individual.
now,
there
are,
i
would
submit
to
the
court,
a
number
of
advantages
certainly,
to
a
use
plus
proofs
immunity.
these
i
believe,
in
terms
of
being
able
to
get
at,
involved
conspiracy
cases
where
you
are
granting
solely,
the
use
plus
proofs
immunity
to
an
individual
will
allow
us
a
greater
opportunity
to
inquire
and
to
determine
the
extent
of
activities
in
which
this
individual
has
been
involved.
while
at
the
same
time,
protecting
the
interest
of
the
state,
perhaps
in
a
future
prosecution
should
that
information
developed
at
a
later
date
or
in
other
jurisdiction.
now
for
instance,
within
the
state
of
new
jersey,
we
have
21
counties
where
we
are
investigating
a
certain
issue
in
the
southern
part
of
new
jersey,
and
we
seek
to
secure
immunity
to
an
individual.
it
may
very
well
be
that
under
a
transactional
statute
or
an
absolute
statute,
we
maybe
granting
an
individual
immunity,
and
granting
him
absolute
protection
to
future
whereas
at
the
same
time
and
completely
unbenounced
to
us,
mr.
hogan
in
new
york
maybe
conducting
investigation,
while
the
district
attorney
and
mr.
inspector
in
philadelphia
maybe
conducting
investigation,
relating
to
the
same
individual.
we
have
absolutely
no
way
of
knowing
exactly
what
these
individuals
are
doing,
recognizing
the
entire
spread
that
conspiracy
of
organized
crime,
recognizing
that
it
knows
no
county
lines
or
international
lines
for
that
matter.
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
or
the
federal
government
itself
maybe
investigating,
yes
sir.
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
unless
this
court
should
adopt
your
honor
--
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
unless
we
recognized
the
limitation,
i
believe
which
was
in
suggested
or
implied
in
counsel
and
recognized
that
a
use
plus
proofs
immunity
which
was
suggested
in
murphy
is
a
constitutional
and
a
viable
standard.
now
if
i
may
just
add
one
thing,
i
think
that
under
a
use
plus
proof
statute,
we
may
very
well
be
for
the
first
time
protecting
the
defendant
who
was
entitled
on
the
six
amendment
to
compulsory
process
and
confrontation
of
witnesses
i
suggest
this
because
formerly
as
united
states
attorney,
i
found
that
when
a
person
is
called
as
a
witness
by
the
defense,
and
that
individual
likes
to
claim
his
privilege,
the
government
is
effectively
precluded
from
securing
that
evidence
because
the
only
thing
we
could
grant
him
would
be
absolute
or
transaction
immunity.
that
fact
deprives
that
defendant
of
the
right
to
confront
that
witness
and
the
right
to
at
least
examine
on
the
basis
of
what
he
contends
is
his
defense.
that
situation
can
be
corrected
with
the
use
plus
proofs
immunity.
and
we
will
be
for
the
first
time
realistic,
extending
the
defendant
his
right
of
compulsory
self
process
and
confrontation.
i
will
be
doing
that
because
then
the
united
states
attorney
cannot
contend
nor
could
any
other
prosecuted
contend
realistically
that
we
cannot
grant
him
transactional
immunity
because
of
the
fact
that
we
will
be
giving
him
absolute
protection
in
the
future,
i
submit
to
you
that
this
in
itself
maybe
the
most
important
issue
that
we
have
under
the
use
plus
proofs.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
i
please
the
court.
it
is
the
appellant's
contention
here
this
morning
that
he
has
been
incarcerated
on
the
new
jersey
state
commission
of
investigation,
the
immunity
statute,
and
he
has
been
in
constituted,
incarcerated
under
a
provision
which
is
unconstitutional.
a
long
line
of
cases,
this
court
have
held
that
an
immunity
statute
maybe
valid.
i
submit
to
you
and
my
further
record
will
state
that
the
commission
statute
is
and
was
designed
to
be
a
use
plus
proof
statute.
it
was
so
designed
to
attempt
to
reach
a
particular
problem
that
existed
in
the
state
of
new
jersey
in
the
period
of
spring
of
1968,
and
was
so
found
to
exist
by
a
joint
legislative
committee
of
the
assembly
of
that
state.
now,
the
statute
itself
recognizes
that
in
order
for
a
immunity
statute
to
supplant
the
privilege
under
the
fifth
amendment
that
it
must
be
co-extensive
with
the
privilege
which
it
seeks
to
supplant.
it
must
never
put
the
individual
in
a
situation
in
which
he
would
be
in
worst
position
than
had
he
exercised
his
privilege
or
been
allowed
to
exercise
his
privilege.
now,
we
contend
that
this
statute
does
just
that.
the
fifth
amendment
says
“no
man
shall
be
compelled
in
a
criminal
case
to
be
a
witness
against
himself”.
our
statute
provides
after
appropriate
steps
of
due
process
within
the
commission
or
within
the
state
process,
that
individual
shall
not
have
any
of
the
testimony
or
the
evidence
or
evidence
derived
there
from
used
against
him
in
any
criminal
prosecution.
we
submit
that
under
these
circumstances,
the
individual
is
in
exactly
the
same
position
as
he
was
had
he
not
been
granted
the
immunity
following
his
claim
of
the
privilege.
now,
since,
course
counsel
in
1892,
which
considered
a
pure
use
statute.
i,
for
the
record
and
the
commission
for
the
record
and
i
feel
state
would
certainly
admit
that
a
pure
use
statute
alone
which
did
not
protect
against
the
use
of
derivative
evidence
must
be
unconstitutional.
it
completely
challenges
the
logic
and
reason
to
be
able
to
say
that
you
can
compel
a
man
to
answer
and
then
go
out
and
secure
evidence
on
the
basis
of
that
answer,
and
use
that
against
him.
by
the
same
token
in
the
brown
decision
some
four
years
later,
the
transactional
immunity
statute
or
the
absolute
immunity
statute,
which
i
believe
flowed
from
counselmen
and
perhaps
at
a
time
when
we
were
not
considering
the
middle
ground,
that
absolute
immunity
statute
was
upheld
and
that
granted
i
submit
a
much
broader
immunity,
that
which
the
fifth
amendment
does
require.
i
submit
also
that
it
when
utilized,
it
grants
a
gratuity
to
the
criminal
upon
who
seeks
to
exercise
it.
i
further
suggest
that
it
does
an
injustice
to
the
best
interest
of
the
people
themselves.
now,
in
that
middle
ground
then,
we
come
to
the
point
of
just
what
is
it,
that
the
fifth
amendment
will
require
of
an
immunity
statute
in
order
for
it
to
be
constitutional.
i
suggest
that
is
a
use
plus
proofs,
an
absolute
situation
whereby
once
you
compel
a
man
to
testify,
you
may
under
no
circumstances
use
anything.
and,
i
use
that
term
with
great
consideration.
anything
whatsoever
that
flows
there
from,
for
if
we
have
compelled
him
to
give
up
a
very
sacred
right,
self
incrimination
against
self
incrimination.
that
then
the
government
must
bear
the
burden
and
must
bear
the
duty,
and
a
very
heavy
duty
perhaps
it
should
be,
to
show
that
nothing
has
ever
been
used
against
that
individual
in
connection
with
any
future
prosecution.
now,
i
submit
that
under
such
a
rule
of
law
with
the
use
plus
proof
statute,
tied
in
with
a
heavy
burden
being
placed
upon
the
government
that
was
noted
in
note
18
of
the
murphy
decision,
that
the
burden
is
placed
upon
the
government
to
establish
independent
source
of
evidence.
that
the
individual
may
very
well
be
in
a
better
position
than
he
is
today
under
a
transactional
statute.
and
i
say
that
for
this
reason,
that
under
the
old
haikey
decision
in
1913,
that
the
individual
must
prove
as
an
affirmative
defense
that
that
transactional
immunity
statute
has
protected
him
against
a
subsequent
indictment.
i
would
submit
that
under
a
use
immunity
or
use
immunity
plus
proof
statute
that
the
burden
here
would
be
on
the
government.
now,
since
the
murphy
decision
--
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
the
use
plus
proof
--
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
i
believe
mr.
justice
white
that
use
immunity
alone
which
would
allow
the
government
or
the
people
thereafter
to
go
out
and
secure
evidence
based
upon
the
testimony
compelled
must
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
i
further
argue
that
a
transactional
or
an
absolute
immunity
is
too
broad,
is
that
it
gives
to
greater
gratuity
to
the
individual
who
seeks
to
utilize
that
privilege
and
then
forces
the
people
to
secure
the
absolute
--
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
i
do
not
suggest
here
that
they
would
like
to
prosecute.
in
our
situation
--
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
in
the
first
instance,
i
would
say
that
you
were
seeking
to
protect
the
individual
in
his
constitutional
rights.
in
the
second
instance,
i
would
say
that
you
were
protecting
the
public
interest
and
their
right
to
able
to
get
at
perhaps,
the
area
of
crimes
involving
involved
conspiracies
with
some
activities.
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
if
such
evidence
of
an
independent
nature
should
be
developed
either
in
a
different
jurisdiction
or
at
a
later
date.
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
absolutely
sir.
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
i
would
have
to
say
--
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
i
would
have
to
say
that
there
is
certainly
is
a
real
possibility
of
that
occurrence.
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
well,
if
i
may
could
just
draw
this
distinction
justice
white,
hours
of
the
state
commission
of
investigation,
we
are
purely
an
investigative
body.
we
have
absolutely
no
prosecutorial
responsibilities.
we
have
no
criminal
jurisdiction
whatsoever.
our
function
as
conceived
by
the
new
jersey
legislature,
was
with
a
broad
area
of
responsibility
to
determine
facts
which
would
then
allow
us
to
make
recommendations
to
the
legislature
for
perhaps
the
enactment
of
legislation
to
correct
a
problem
as
what
it
seen
to
exist.
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
i
suggested
that
perhaps
the
individual
might
be
in
a
better
position
because
with
the
use
plus
proofs,
the
burden
of
establishing,
the
relationship
would
be
on
the
government
and
on
the
people
that
return
the
indictment
whereas
now
it
is
my
understanding
of
the
law
that
with
the
transactional
grant
of
immunity
should
he
later
be
indicted
that
he
must
prove
that
as
an
affirmative
defense
in
the
defense
of
this
case.
that
was
my
sole
position
suggesting
that
he
might
be
at
a
better
position.
certainly,
i
think
that
if
our
statute
were
transactional
or
would
it
be
such
or
absolute,
we
would
not
be
here
today.
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
i
think
it
makes
a
very
substantial
difference
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
no,
i
am
not
suggesting
that
at
all
sir.
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
i
believe
that
under
the
circumstances
that
existed
in
new
jersey
in
1968,
that
there
was
a
sufficiently
severe
problem
to
warrant
the
enactment
of
the
statute
in
order
for
us
as
fact
finding
body,
to
secure
information
which
could
give
rise
to
testimony.
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
but
at
the
same
time,
we
would
then
have
been
granting
a
collective
immunity
to
mr.
zicarelli.
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
correct
sir.
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
with
the
burden
of
proof
being
placed
upon
the
government
should
any
indictment
ever
be
forth
coming.
now
then
--
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
the
extraordinary
situation,
well.
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
yes.
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
the
statute
is
still
in
effect
that—
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
in
the
spring
of
1968,
there
was
convened
in
new
jersey,
a
special
legislative
committee
which
found
that
at
time
a
serious
organized
crime
problem
did
exist
within
the
state.
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
the
commission
is
still
in
effect.
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
yes
sir,
it
is.
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
well,
we
hope
that
to
some
extent
the
problem
has
diminished.
we
do
recognize
that
--
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
i
would
frankly
hope
not,
because
if
the
use
plus
proof
immunity
statute
--
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
that
is
my
position
sir.
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
yes
sir.
now,
in
terms
of
protection
of
the
individual
since
1892
to
the
present
time
which
has
been
some
80
years.
there
has
been
developed
in
this
court
a
rule
of
law
and
a
body
of
law
which
did
not
existed
that
time.
and
to
that,
i
am
referring
to
the
exclusionary
rule
of
law
that
has
been
utilized
in
connection
with
the
fourth
amendment
cases,
under
unreasonable
search
and
seizures,
under
electronic
eavesdropping,
under
the
sixth
amendment,
under
the
right
to
counsel
and
coerced
confessions.
now,
this
body
of
law
did
not
exist,
and
was
not
available
for
the
court’s
consideration.
under
counselmen
nor
was
it
available
under
brown,
and
i
submit
that
this
court
has
now
developed
a
new
body
of
law
which
is
capable
and
is
absolutely
certain
of
protecting
the
rights
of
individual.
should
they
be
found
to
be
abridged
under
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
i
suggest
that
in
terms
of
the
fact
that
the
information
and
the
protection
which
might
be
secured
to
the
individual,
of
course,
that
information
is
always
in
the
hands
of
the
government.
it
was
in
the
hands
of
the
police
department
in
miranda
decision.
it
has
always
been
in
the
hands
of
the
government
and
the
electronics
eavesdropping
cases,
or
the
hands
of
somebody
else.
and
still
in
our
courts,
the
judiciary
throughout
this
country
has
found
it
capable
to
be
able
to
protect
the
right
of
each
and
every
individual.
now,
there
are,
i
would
submit
to
the
court,
a
number
of
advantages
certainly,
to
a
use
plus
proofs
immunity.
these
i
believe,
in
terms
of
being
able
to
get
at,
involved
conspiracy
cases
where
you
are
granting
solely,
the
use
plus
proofs
immunity
to
an
individual
will
allow
us
a
greater
opportunity
to
inquire
and
to
determine
the
extent
of
activities
in
which
this
individual
has
been
involved.
while
at
the
same
time,
protecting
the
interest
of
the
state,
perhaps
in
a
future
prosecution
should
that
information
developed
at
a
later
date
or
in
other
jurisdiction.
now
for
instance,
within
the
state
of
new
jersey,
we
have
21
counties
where
we
are
investigating
a
certain
issue
in
the
southern
part
of
new
jersey,
and
we
seek
to
secure
immunity
to
an
individual.
it
may
very
well
be
that
under
a
transactional
statute
or
an
absolute
statute,
we
maybe
granting
an
individual
immunity,
and
granting
him
absolute
protection
to
future
whereas
at
the
same
time
and
completely
unbenounced
to
us,
mr.
hogan
in
new
york
maybe
conducting
investigation,
while
the
district
attorney
and
mr.
inspector
in
philadelphia
maybe
conducting
investigation,
relating
to
the
same
individual.
we
have
absolutely
no
way
of
knowing
exactly
what
these
individuals
are
doing,
recognizing
the
entire
spread
that
conspiracy
of
organized
crime,
recognizing
that
it
knows
no
county
lines
or
international
lines
for
that
matter.
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
or
the
federal
government
itself
maybe
investigating,
yes
sir.
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
unless
this
court
should
adopt
your
honor
--
mr.
andrew
f.
phelan
unless
we
recognized
the
limitation,
i
believe
which
was
in
suggested
or
implied
in
counsel
and
recognized
that
a
use
plus
proofs
immunity
which
was
suggested
in
murphy
is
a
constitutional
and
a
viable
standard.
now
if
i
may
just
add
one
thing,
i
think
that
under
a
use
plus
proof
statute,
we
may
very
well
be
for
the
first
time
protecting
the
defendant
who
was
entitled
on
the
six
amendment
to
compulsory
process
and
confrontation
of
witnesses
i
suggest
this
because
formerly
as
united
states
attorney,
i
found
that
when
a
person
is
called
as
a
witness
by
the
defense,
and
that
individual
likes
to
claim
his
privilege,
the
government
is
effectively
precluded
from
securing
that
evidence
because
the
only
thing
we
could
grant
him
would
be
absolute
or
transaction
immunity.
that
fact
deprives
that
defendant
of
the
right
to
confront
that
witness
and
the
right
to
at
least
examine
on
the
basis
of
what
he
contends
is
his
defense.
that
situation
can
be
corrected
with
the
use
plus
proofs
immunity.
and
we
will
be
for
the
first
time
realistic,
extending
the
defendant
his
right
of
compulsory
self
process
and
confrontation.
i
will
be
doing
that
because
then
the
united
states
attorney
cannot
contend
nor
could
any
other
prosecuted
contend
realistically
that
we
cannot
grant
him
transactional
immunity
because
of
the
fact
that
we
will
be
giving
him
absolute
protection
in
the
future,
i
submit
to
you
that
this
in
itself
maybe
the
most
important
issue
that
we
have
under
the
use
plus
proofs.
thank
you
sir.
