against
the

state
commission
of
investigation.
mr.
querques,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
speaking
now
of
his
worsening
situation,
solely,
purely
in
terms
of
exposure
in
possible
prosecutions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
state
of
federal
courts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
judge
sykes
was
speaking
of
his
posture
if
he
recalled
as
a
witness
in
subsequent
trial?
did
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
anything
about
the
use
immunity
granted
before
the
grand
jury
or
investigative
body
that
would
prevent
him
from
claiming
his
fifth
amendment
privileges
anew
on
any
new
matter
when
he
was
called
as
the
witness
in
the
trial
or
subjected
to
cross
examination?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
repeat
my
question.
when
he
is
in
the
court
room
for
the
trial,
though
some
case
subsequent
to
his
grand
jury
appearance
or
in
your
case
appearance
before
the
commission,
is
there
anything
that
prevents
him
from
using
the
fifth
amendment?
if
he
is
subjected
to
a
question
which
he
thinks
in
and
of
itself
will
incriminate
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
the
name
of
that
case
that
you
referred
to
which
judge
sykes
wrote
for
the
third
amendment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
do
not
seem
to
find
it
in
your—
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
used
when
there
is
only
one
accused
person
involved
or
is
it
used
where
there
are
multiple
persons?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
you
give
me
an
illustration
of
an
individual
crime
in
which
they
would
have
any
occasion
to
use
this?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
would
be
the
point
of
giving
him
any
kind
of
immunity?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
querques.
mr.
phelan?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
phelan.
mr.
kugler?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
kugler.
mr.
querques,
you
have
anything
in
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
that
came
to
pass
mr.
querques,
the
prosecution
whether
federal
or
state
making
use
of
it
would
have
burden
of
proving
an
independent
source,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
they
had
an
independent
source
that
was
prior
to
the
inquiry,
under
which
testimony
was
compelled,
why
should
they
not
be
able
to
use
the
testimony
for
that
independent
source?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
us
assume
on.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
speaking
of
another
jurisdiction.
take
the
hypothetical
at
some
time,
i
believe
mr.
justice
white
suggested
or
someone
did
in
response
to
his
question.
that
mr.
frank
hogan
in
new
york
is
deeply
involved
in
an
investigation
that
is
being
carried
on
with
great
secrecy
as
some
of
these
investigations
are?
and
unknown
to
him,
a
witness
who
is
granted
immunity
over
in
new
jersey
or
down
in
pennsylvania.
if
he
can
show,
mr.
hogan
can
show
that
he
had
this
information
long
before,
the
investigation
in
new
jersey
or
pennsylvania,
can
you
suggest
any
reason
why
he
should
not
be
permitted
to
use
it,
if
he
can
carry
that
burden?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but,
we
are
not
--
this
court
is
in
a
position
to
make
a
choice
between
two
different
kinds
of
immunity.
one
of
which
is
more
desirable
than
another
mr.
querques.
we
are
just
required
to
make
a
decision
other
the
constitutional
forbids
a
particular
one,
which
is
before
us
today.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
within
state
where
a
district
attorney
was
elected
in
each
district,
the
sovereign
of
that
district
attorney
is
not
the
state.
the
sovereign,
the
voters
who
elected
him,
is
not
that
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
that
district
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
were
emphasizing
earlier
mr.
querques
that
something
you
called
a
trilemma,
you
seem
to
suggest
that
the
law
has
some
kind
of
duty
to
spare
a
man
from
the
temptation
or
as
you
put
it
the
pressure
to
commit
perjury
in
order
to
save
himself?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
what
about
the
man
who
takes
the
stand
in
a
criminal
case
in
his
own
defense
to
testify?
on
direct
examination
of
garcia’s
counsel
he
is
going
to
be
quite
cautious
about
what
he
asks
him.
i
would
assume
you
have
conceive
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
not
the
broad
power
of
cross
examination,
put
that
witness
to
defendant
under
a
great
temptation
or
pressure,
do
you
want
to
use
that
term?
to
commit
perjury
in
order
to
avoid
unpleasant
answers?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
just
focusing
just
on
the
pressure
here.
you
were
suggesting
that
it
is
unfair
to
put
a
man
under
pressure
to
commit
perjury
in
order
to
save
his
neck,
that
is
the
way
you
put
it,
but
the
pressure
is
the
same
kind
of
pressure
by
way
of
cross
examination
in
that
sense,
is
it
not?

justice
