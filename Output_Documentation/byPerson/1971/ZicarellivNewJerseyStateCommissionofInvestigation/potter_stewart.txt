do
you
think
that
--
we
are
speculating
that
you
are
giving
us
that
speculative
hypothesis
in
a
case
where
the
person
has
been
affirmatively
granted
immunity
from
prosecution.
do
you
still
think
that
the
district
attorney
would
be
so
obsessed
with
making
a
case
after
having
an
affirmative
grant
of
immunity
from
prosecution?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
i
know.
justice
potter
stewart
this
immunity,
you
sent
proofs,
you
referred
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
understand
that.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
your
argument
if
there
were
a
transactional
immunity,
he
would
be
wasting
his
time,
but
your
point
is
that
with
what
you
call
use
immunity
and
it
is
a
little
than
use
immunity
as
i
read
the
statute,
it
is
use
of
the
answer
or
evidence,
or
evidence
derived
there
from,
so
it
is
use
and
proofs
as
it
is
generally
put.
but
my
question
is
just
as
to
your
speculative
argument
that
the
prosecuting
attorney
after
a
person
has
been
affirmatively
given
this
immunity,
that
he
would
be
obsessively
motivated
to
go
out
and
make
a
case
against
a
man?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
generally,
one
does
not
find
that
immunity
statute
used
in
that
type
of
criminal
activity,
is
not
that
true?
justice
potter
stewart
this
commission,
this
state
commission
was
not
setup
to
investigate
a
deal
with
individual
crimes
of
violence
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
setup
to
deal
with
organized
crime?
