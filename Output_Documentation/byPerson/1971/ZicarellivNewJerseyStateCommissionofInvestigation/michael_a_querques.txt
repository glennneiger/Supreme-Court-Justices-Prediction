mr.
michael
a.
querques
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
facts
of
this
particular
matter
sparse
as
they
are
warrant
some
little
attention
here
this
morning.
sometime
in
1969,
mr.
zicarelli
was
served
with
subpoena
to
appear
before
a
new
commission
in
new
jersey
which
is
called
a
state
commission
of
investigation.
the
state
commission
of
investigation
was
operating
under
something
else
which
was
new
in
new
jersey,
and
that
is
a
so
called
use
immunity
or
testimonial
immunity
statute.
consequently,
as
result
of
being
asked
questions
and
being
offered
the
immunity,
which
was
provided
for
by
the
statute,
mr.
zicarelli
chose
to
invoke
his
privilege
under
the
fifth
amendment
not
to
testify
on
the
grounds
that
use
immunity
so
called
was
not
sufficient.
he
was
not
upheld
in
that
argument,
and
ultimately
was
held
in
contempt
and
appeal
was
taken
to
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
and
again,
his
claim
of
privilege
under
the
fifth
was
denied.
as
a
result
of
which,
under
the
statute
in
new
jersey,
somewhat
peculiar
statute,
mr.
zicarelli
was
confined
to
an
institution
in
yardville,
new
jersey,
presumably
for
the
rest
of
his
life
because
the
statute
in
new
jersey
provides
for
no
particular
period
of
confinement
and
it
was
a
civil
contempt,
civil
confinement
and
as
i
say,
no
particular
period
of
cut
off.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
yes
your
honor,
he
would
have
been
released.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
that
is
accurate,
your
honor.
so,
we
are
faced
then
in
this
case
with
the
ultimate
issue
as
to
whether
or
not,
so
called
use
or
testimonial
immunity
is
consistent
with
the
fifth
amendment.
and,
this
ultimate
issue
as
far
as
i
can
make
it
out
from
all
of
the
cases
that
i
have
read,
depends
upon
the
particular
answer
that
you
give
to
the
one
single
test,
and
that
is
whether
or
not,
the
witness
is
in
the
same
position,
after
he
has
testified
as
though
he
had
not
testified.
and
therefore,
i
would
like
to
try
this
morning
to
persuade
this
court
that
a
witness
such
as
mr.
zicarelli
would
be
in
a
far
worst
position
after
he
testified
then
if
he
had
not
testified
under
this
use
immunity
statute.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
yes,
your
honor.
there
maybe
some
other
considerations
--
mr.
michael
a.
querques
in
both
your
honor.
there
is
a
case
out
of
the
third
circuit,
catena
involving
other
individual
who
had
exactly
the
same
problem
and
the
i
think
that
the
opinion
by
chief
judge
sykes
in
that
case
is
certainly
applicable
here.
chief
judge
sykes
says
that
the
defendant
is
in
a
worst
position
or
stated
differently.
he
is
not
in
the
same
position
as
though
he
had
not
testified
because
once
the
district
attorney
would
have
that
compelled
testimony,
the
district
attorney
would
be
able
to
use
that
compelled
testimony
in
cross
examination.
and
chief
judge
sykes
says
even
if
there
were
no
over
reference
to
the
compelled
testimony,
the
questions
could
be
phrased
in
such
a
way
that
the
use
of
the
compelled
testimony
would
necessarily
impeach
and
damage
the
defendant.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
yes,
chief
justice.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
i
am
not
certain
that
i
understand
the
question
but
if
i
do,
as
i
understand
the
use
immunity,
it
would
be
of
no
avail
to
the
defendant
facing
the
prosecution
to
raise
it
all
over
again
because
it
could
be
used
--
mr.
michael
a.
querques
well,
i
think
that
question
is
also
answered
by
judge
sykes
and
that
argument
goes
along
these
lines.
that
the
defendant,
even
if
assured
that
the
answers
he
gave
in
the
compelled
testimony
before
the
grand
jury
or
before
a
commission
would
not
be
used.
nonetheless,
it
would
bear
on
his
mind
and
he
would
therefore
be
influenced
to
forego
and
give
up
or
forsake
that
right
that
he
would
have
to
defend
himself.
and
i
think,
that
is
a
very
crucial
consideration.
leaving
that
answer
and
going
to
the
next
one
that
i
have
in
mind,
and
that
is
the
one
by
justice
brennan
in
the
picarello(ph)
decision
the
dissent,
and
that
would
be
that
the
uncertainties
of
the
fact
finding
process
and
the
hazards
to
the
witness
argue
very
strongly
against
use
immunity.
i
do
not
think
that
anyone
could
argue
against
the
fact
that
the
government
would
have
all
of
the
relevant
evidence,
and
any
of
us
who
had
experience
with
the
government
know
that
they
are
files
and
then
there
are
confidential
files.
many,
many
times,
if
not
indeed
all
the
time.
the
young
district
attorney
trying
a
case
in
the
federal
court
is
completely
unaware
of
so
called
confidential
information
resting
in
the
confidential
file
of
the
secret
service
or
immigration
authorities
or
the
fbi
offices.
and
consequently,
he
is
not
in
a
position
though
the
burden
would
be
on
the
government
to
show
that
the
prosecution
is
untainted.
he
would
be
in
no
position
to
rebut
the
evidence
offered
by
the
government.
in
addition
to
that,
the
best
defense
for
a
person
placed
in
the
situation
where
he
has
to
testify
under
use
immunity
could
never
establish
if
there
was
for
example,
an
accidental
or
an
unrecorded
exchange
of
information
which
somehow
tainted
his
indictment.
there
would
be
no
way
of
showing
that
a
poor
memory
was
attendant
to
the
situation
in
order
to
show
the
taint.
many
times,
and
i
think
that
this
court
has
seen
it
recently
proofs
are
lost
through
either
death,
through
resignation,
through
disability
or
through
retirement.
the
case
that
i
am
thinking
about
is
the
recent
case
out
of
new
york
of
santa
belo
where
one
prosecutor
made
a
so
called
arrangement
with
the
defendant,
and
then
as
a
result
of
leaving
his
position,
another
district
attorney
came
in
and
would
not
honor
the
arrangement
previously
made.
you
could
have
exactly
the
same
situation
here.
one
district
attorney
would
leave
his
office
or
would
die
or
retire,
and
something
that
was
left
behind
could
be
used
by
someone
else
and
the
defendant
could
never
establish
it
because
of
that
situation.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
yes,
he
did
your
honor.
but
i
think—
mr.
michael
a.
querques
yes
sir.
but
i
think
in
this
situation,
i
would
ask
you
to
understand
that
it
gets
more
difficult.
we
have
a
situation
here
where
the
years
may
go
by
and
santa
belo,
you
have
in
a
direct
appeal
immediately
following
the
so
called
reneging
on
the
bargain
and
he
could
do
it
with
a
great
deal
or
more
expedition
that
put
a
man
in
this
particular
situation.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
it
is
not
in
the
briefs
your
honor
because
it
was
decided
after
we
filed
a
brief.
the
name
of
the
case
is
catena
against
the
very
same
commission
involved
in
this
case.
i
am
sorry,
i
understand
now
that
is
captured
in
the
name
of
the
warden
of
the
institution
whose
name
would
be
albert
elias.
so,
it
is
catena
against
elias.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
it
is
decided
your
honor,
pleases
on
september
2,
1971.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
i
am
sorry
mr.
justice
white?
mr.
michael
a.
querques
yes.
pending
the
outcome
of
this
case.
while
none
of
the
case
is
referred
to
the
next
point
i
would
like
to
make,
to
me
as
i
review
the
matter,
it
seems
to
be
of
great
importance
and
that
is
this.
a
defendant
placed
in
this
situation
could
never
rebut
the
government’s
assertion
that
his
prosecution
is
untainted.
if
indeed,
there
was
some
collusion
or
some
chicanery
between
one
jurisdiction
and
another,
or
between
one
particular
district
attorney
and
another.
professor
mansfield
points
up
another
reason
for
indicating
that
a
witness
would
be
much
worst
off,
and
that
is
this
argument
that
upon
disclosure
by
a
person
that
he
or
she
committed
a
particular
offense,
the
district
attorney
once
knowing
of
the
commission
of
that
offense
by
this
particular
individual.
i
would
feel
would
be
compelled
or
forced
to
go
out
and
make
the
case
or
be
it
he
would
try
to
make
it
independently.
so,
you
therefore
had
an
individual
who
before
he
gave
the
testimony,
compelled
as
it
is
would
be
able
to
go
to
sweep
at
night
knowing
that
there
was
no
concerted
effort
to
have
him
indicted
or
as
once
he
gave
the
compelled
testimony,
he
had
to
go
to
sweep
each
and
every
night
knowing
that
that
district
attorney
had
sent
his
investigators
out
into
the
field
to
make
a
case
and
not
to
rest
until
they
made
a
case.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
i
am
sorry
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
am
arguing
against
use
immunity.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
that
you
were
giving
this
--
mr.
michael
a.
querques
but
we
were
given
immunity
from
prosecution.
i
would
not
make
the
argument
because
then
the
district
attorney
would
be
wasting
his
time
by
still
trying
to
go
out
there
and
make
a
case.
the
man
had
immunity
from
prosecution.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
he
would
know
he
could—
mr.
michael
a.
querques
i
think
he
would,
yes.
i
think
he
would.
and
if
you
look
at
it
in
this
page,
there
maybe
more
light
on
that.
take
the
situation
where
the
prosecutor
is
asking
a
question
in
the
case
where
he
anticipates
only
one
defendant.
let
us
take
for
example
a
rape
case.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
there
is
only
one
defendant.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
if
there
is
only
one
defendant,
what
possible
reason
would
he
have
under
a
use
immunity
statute
plus
proofs
to
interrogate
that
individual?
if
he
did
want
to
use
the
answer
somehow
to
the
benefit
of
he
himself
the
prosecutor.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
true.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
no.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
no,
that
is
correct.
but
when
we
are
talking
about
use
immunity
statutes,
i
think
that
we
have
to
include
the
individual
cases,
as
well
as
the
so
called
conspiracy
or
multiple
defendant
cases
because
in
my
honest
judgment,
there
such
a
statute
will
be
used
in
both
kinds
of
cases.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
i
think
it
would
more
often
be
used
mr.
chief
justice
in
the
multiple
defendant
type
case,
but
i
also
believe
that
it
would
also
be
used
in
the
individual
defendant.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
yes,
i
will.
i
think
in
the
rape
that
i
have
mentioned
or
if
there
were
a
robbery
which
was
carried
off
by
a
single
individual.
if
there
were
a
murder,
it
was
perpetrated
by
a
single
individual.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
that
is
exactly
my
point,
that
if
called
a
man
under
a
use
immunity
statute
and
he
interrogated
him,
he
would
not
be
giving
him
anything
because
he
could
still
prosecute
the
individual.
so
therefore,
if
he
called
him
in,
he
must
have
had
some
evil
motive
on
his
mind,
viz-a-viz
that
particular
defendant.
if
he
knew
that
only
one
man
committed
the
crime
and
he
called
in
a
single
individual
and
questioned
him
under
use
immunity,
that
prosecutor
knows
that
he
ultimately
came
into
independent
evidence,
he
could
indict
that
individual.
whereas,
he
would
not
do
it
if
he
had
the
transactional
type
of
immunity.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
i
certainly
do.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
that
would
depend
upon
the
facts
but,
if
there
is
stimulation,
and
i
would
concede
that
there
would
be
some
depending
upon
the
personality
of
the
particular
district
attorney.
the
stipulation
in
such
a
case
would
be
much,
much
more
mile
than
the
kind
of
stimulation
that
would
occur
if
under
one
of
these
use
immunity
statutes.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
the
prosecutor
ended
up
with
a
confession.
i
would
think,
mr.
justice
white,
that
any
prosecutor
under
a
use
immunity
statute.
who
had
in
effect
a
confession
from
the
witness
that
he
called
in
would
be
obliged
to
go
out
and
try
to
make
a
case.
i
can't
imagine
sitting
back
and
saying
i
have
a
transcript
wherein
a
admits
murder
and
yet,
i
am
not
going
to
do
anything
about
it,
by
making
an
independent
case.
so
a
as
much
worst
off.
we
come
to
another
consideration
which
i
think
probably
is
the
most
crucial
of
all,
it
is
the
one
that
disturbs
me
as
a
lawyer
the
most,
and
that
is
subjecting
a
witness
to
this
cruel
trilemma
referred
to
by
justice
brennan
of
perjury,
self
accusation
or
contempt,
and
i
have
analyzed
the
situation
and
come
to
this
conclusion.
that
if
a
person
--
mr.
michael
a.
querques
mr.
justice
white,
i
am
sorry.
i
did
not
hear
the
question.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
yes.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
except
that
here
there
is
a
particular
flavor
to
it
because
of
these
trilemma
that
is
forced
by
the
witness.
i
would
think
that
the
self
accusation
or
confession
situation
is
the
least
likely
to
occur.
because
i
think
that
that
is
the
one
that
a
witness
would
want
to
avoid
the
most,
confessing
to
the
crime.
i
would
think
on
the
other
hand
that
the
one
most
likely
to
occur
would
be
that
he
would
elect
because
he
is
forced
to
testify
to
commit
perjury.
i
can
concede
he
may
give
a
false
alibi
or
some
other
story.
that
is
a
white
color
crime,
say
he
did
not
have
criminal
knowledge
or
willful
intent
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
statute.
i
could
even
concede
that
he
might
plead
and
trap.
but
in
any
event,
i
see
that
he
would
setup
some
perjurious
story,
so
that
would
not
have
to
confess
and
at
the
same
time,
he
would
not
have
to
go
to
jail
for
contempt.
i
think
it
is
fairly
likely
that
the
person
who
would
not
want
to
accuse
himself
and
at
the
same
time
would
not
want
to
run
the
risk
of
perjury
would
do
this.
he
would
say,
for
example,
there
are
two
years
or
maybe
three
years
left
before
the
statute
of
limitations
expires.
and
so,
i
will
take
the
contempt
and
have
myself
incarcerated,
and
wade
out
the
statute
of
limitations
because
it
is
easier
to
wade
out
a
two
or
three
year-balance
on
the
statute
of
limitations.
than
it
would
be
to
face
the
indictment
and
prosecution
and
then
perhaps
do
10,
20
or
30
years
in
jail.
now
because,
that
situation
will
occur
and
it
will
occur
in
every
single
case
where
use
immunity
is
used,
the
witness
will
have
to
make
a
choice
of
one
of
those
three,
there
is
no
other
choice.
i
say
most
respectfully
that
the
state,
the
federal
government
or
whoever
it
maybe
is
doing
something
very,
very
distasteful,
and
something
very,
very
contrary
to
the
american
concept
of
justice.
because
it
is,
actually
inducing
or
coercing
a
crime
to
take
place
which
has
not
yet
taken
place
to
it
the
crime
of
perjury.
if
that
is
not
the
result,
the
result
is
that
the
man
goes
to
jail
for
contempt,
that
is
also
foreign
to
our
system
of
justice
because
you
call
on
a
suspect,
he
refuses
to
answer
the
questions,
and
he
ends
up
in
jail
for
contempt
whereas
he
should
have
ended
up
in
jail,
only
if
the
state
in
shouldering
its
responsibility,
made
an
accusation
by
way
of
indictment
and
produced
evidence
in
court
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
i
also
wonder
as
to
what
role
we
lawyers
would
play
in
such
a
situation
and
i
think,
most
respectfully
that
lawyers
would
be
compelled
almost
to
abandon
a
client.
i
can't
imagine
that
a
lawyer
would
feel
at
all
comfortable
with
a
witness
facing
this
trial
on
him.
speaking
for
myself
and
many
others
like
me,
you
would
be
most
uncomfortable
sitting
next
to
a
client
knowing
that
that
client
has
confessed.
there
is
one
case
in
this
court
that
in
essence
says
“a
lawyer
who
tells
his
client
to
cooperate
and
give
up
all
his
rights
is
in
worth
his
soul”.
i
would
not
feel
like
i
were
worth
my
soul
if
told
a
man
to
give
a
confession
rather
than
require
the
state
to
prove
its
case.
the
witness
sitting
in
that
chair
on
the
use
immunity
is
sitting
and
let
me
call
it
a
“warm
chair”.
the
chair
next
to
him
occupied
by
the
lawyer
is
just
as
warm
for
the
lawyer
indeed
it
might
be
very,
very
warm,
it
might
be
hot.
because
the
lawyer
would
have
to
be
concerned
that
if
his
client
took
the
second
choice
to
with
perjury,
the
lawyer
might
ultimately
be
accused
of
suborning
that
perjury.
and
if
we
get
down
to
the
third
possibility
and
that
is
contempt,
the
lawyer
then
really
is
useless
to
the
client
because
if
the
client
says
to
the
lawyer
under
this
situation,
i
am
going
to
do
sometime
in
jail
until
the
statute
of
limitations
runs
out.
there
is
not
anything
that
the
lawyer
can
do
for
him.
so,
i
say
for
these
reasons
and
many
others
which
i
do
not
have
time
to
elucidate
on
and
hopefully
some
of
the
other
lawyers
who
appear
in
the
cases
will.
that
transactional
immunity
as
it
presently
stands
should
remain,
that
use
immunity
is
very,
very
foreign
to
our
system
of
justice
and
will
work
such
hazards,
and
will
work
such
injustices
as
time
will
prove
if
it
ever
comes
to
be.
thank
you.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
respond
just
for
a
few
moment
as
if
i
have
not
left
to
of
what
you
think
that
mr.
phelan
said.
mr.
justice
white
asked
mr.
phelan
or
whether
or
not
indeed
the
state
of
new
jersey
wanted
to
retain
the
right
to
prosecute
the
man
who
was
called
about
the
very
matters
about
what
he
was
questioned.
and
mr.
phelan
said
to
the
court
that
his
commission
had
no
prosecutorial
responsibility.
while
that
is
true,
it
is
also
true
under
their
statute
that
they
are
obliged
to
disseminate
the
information
which
they
obtained
from
question
for
the
local
prosecutors
who
are
21
in
number,
for
the
state
attorney
general’s
office,
and
to
the
federal
authorities.
in
short,
anybody
who
might
be
able
to
use
it.
mr.
phelan
indicated
that
this
statute
comes
in
handy
and
discovering
evidence
with
respect
to
large
scale
conspiracies
assume
that
to
be
true.
i
do
believe
that
it
is
asking
for
anything
to
give
a
man
immunity
from
prosecution,
that
he
helps
you
to
solve
a
large
scale
conspiracy
case,
and
gives
testimony
against
seven,
eight,
nine,
10
or
more
co-defendants.
done
everyday,
prosecutors
like
to
do
it,
and
it
would
just
actually
be
a
continuation
of
that
situation.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
that
would
be
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
that
is
a
very
rare
situation,
and
i
would
think
--
mr.
michael
a.
querques
i
would
think
that
they
would
be
full
hardened,
indeed
assuming
that
they
had
an
independent
case,
then
to
call
to
in
the
witness
whom
they
want
to
prosecute.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
he
should
be
permitted
to
use
it.
i
have
no
objection
to
that,
but
i
quickly
point
out
to
the
court
that
he
can
use
it
on
the
transaction
only
he
if
he
could.
because
under
murphy,
mr.
hogan
is
only
barred
from
using
the
fruits,
that
he
has
an
independent
case,
whether
it
be
transactional
immunity
or
use
immunity,
mr.
hogan
can
proceed
with
his
case.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
yes,
i
quite
understand
that
and
for
the
reason
that
indicated
that
i
think,
with
respect
to
the
questioning
jurisdiction,
the
constitutional
standard
is
only
met
when
the
questioning
jurisdiction
gives
prosecutional
immunity
or
absolute
--
mr.
michael
a.
querques
mr.
justice
white,
i
--
mr.
michael
a.
querques
well,
because
mr.
hogan
is
not
bringing
in
that
witness.
he
is
not
making
a
decision—
mr.
michael
a.
querques
if
i
understood
your
question,
it
assume
that—for
example,
a
new
jersey
prosecutor
would
bring
in
a
witness,
and
question—
mr.
michael
a.
querques
yes.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
yes,
because
he
is
not
from
the
questioning
jurisdiction.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
he
has
an
upset
--
upset
the
balance.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
no,
i
do
not
think
--
excuse
me
sir,
i
do
not
you
are
treating
them
differently.
you
are
analyzing
the
situation
to
determine
whether
or
not
that
questioning
prosecutor,
number
1,
knows
what
he
is
doing,
and
you
are
telling
him
in
advance
that
if
you
call
in
mr.
x
and
you
question
him.
you
better
be
prepared
to
give
him
transactional
immunity
because
we
can
bind
you
in
that
way
under
the
united
states
constitution.
on
the
other
hand,
mr.
prosecutor
in
new
york,
we
cannot
bind
you
under
the
constitution
for
giving
prosecutional
immunity,
because
you
did
no
call
in
that
man.
you
did
not
make
a
decision.
so,
we
cannot
bind
your
hand.
we
cannot
tell
you
what
to
do
other
than
to
say
“you
cannot
use
the
proof’s”
or
what
the
prosecutor
in
san
francisco
did.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
i
make
it
just
as
clear
as
i
can.
a
prosecutor
who
does
not
call
in
the
witness
should
not
be
bound
for
the
same
standard
as
the
prosecutor
who
has
plenty
of
time
to
think
about
what
he
is
doing.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
and,
call
then
the
individual.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
not
bound.
san
francisco,
los
angeles,
both
in
california
would
be
bound
sir.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
yes,
i
would
say
he
is
bound,
because
they
are
working
under
one
sovereign.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
but,
he
is
working
in
the
state
that
he
is
working
within
the
same
framework.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
well.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
that
is
one
way
to
look
at
it.
i
cannot
look
at
it
that
way.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
i
do
not
it
should
spare
him,
i
say
it
should
not
induce
him
to
do
it.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
i
would
say
yes,
it
does
to
you
but,
it
does
it
in
a
different
framework.
and,
do
not
lose
sight
of
the
fact
pleas
that
the
defendant
in
the
given
case,
when
he
takes
the
stand,
he
takes
it
knowing
that
he
is
waived
his
right
under
the
fifth
amendment,
whereas
the
follow
who
is
sitting
home
having
dinner
one
evening
and
receives
a
subpoena,
he
has
not
elected
to
take
the
stand.
he
is
compelled
to
take
the
witness
chair,
whether
it
be
grand
jury
or
sci
or
anything
else,
there
is
that
crucial
difference.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
i
would
conceive
to
you
that
once
the
defendant
in
a
trial
elects
to
take
the
stand,
he
yes,
is
under
pressure.
but
the
pressure
to
begin
with,
is
a
lot
less,
and
it
is
a
pressure
that
he
is
wiling
to
take,
and
it
is
a
pressure
against
which
he
has
no
constitutional
guarantee.
he
has
waived
that
constitutional
guarantee
by
walking
into
chair.
the
man
that
we
are
talking
about
has
not
waved
anything.
they
have
forced
him
into
the
chair
and
enforcing
him
into
the
chair,
they
forced
him
into
that
trilemmic
situation,
which
he
cannot
live
with,
his
lawyer
cannot
live
with
and
i
say
that
this
society
should
not
live
with
it.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
facts
of
this
particular
matter
sparse
as
they
are
warrant
some
little
attention
here
this
morning.
sometime
in
1969,
mr.
zicarelli
was
served
with
subpoena
to
appear
before
a
new
commission
in
new
jersey
which
is
called
a
state
commission
of
investigation.
the
state
commission
of
investigation
was
operating
under
something
else
which
was
new
in
new
jersey,
and
that
is
a
so
called
use
immunity
or
testimonial
immunity
statute.
consequently,
as
result
of
being
asked
questions
and
being
offered
the
immunity,
which
was
provided
for
by
the
statute,
mr.
zicarelli
chose
to
invoke
his
privilege
under
the
fifth
amendment
not
to
testify
on
the
grounds
that
use
immunity
so
called
was
not
sufficient.
he
was
not
upheld
in
that
argument,
and
ultimately
was
held
in
contempt
and
appeal
was
taken
to
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
and
again,
his
claim
of
privilege
under
the
fifth
was
denied.
as
a
result
of
which,
under
the
statute
in
new
jersey,
somewhat
peculiar
statute,
mr.
zicarelli
was
confined
to
an
institution
in
yardville,
new
jersey,
presumably
for
the
rest
of
his
life
because
the
statute
in
new
jersey
provides
for
no
particular
period
of
confinement
and
it
was
a
civil
contempt,
civil
confinement
and
as
i
say,
no
particular
period
of
cut
off.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
yes
your
honor,
he
would
have
been
released.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
that
is
accurate,
your
honor.
so,
we
are
faced
then
in
this
case
with
the
ultimate
issue
as
to
whether
or
not,
so
called
use
or
testimonial
immunity
is
consistent
with
the
fifth
amendment.
and,
this
ultimate
issue
as
far
as
i
can
make
it
out
from
all
of
the
cases
that
i
have
read,
depends
upon
the
particular
answer
that
you
give
to
the
one
single
test,
and
that
is
whether
or
not,
the
witness
is
in
the
same
position,
after
he
has
testified
as
though
he
had
not
testified.
and
therefore,
i
would
like
to
try
this
morning
to
persuade
this
court
that
a
witness
such
as
mr.
zicarelli
would
be
in
a
far
worst
position
after
he
testified
then
if
he
had
not
testified
under
this
use
immunity
statute.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
yes,
your
honor.
there
maybe
some
other
considerations
--
mr.
michael
a.
querques
in
both
your
honor.
there
is
a
case
out
of
the
third
circuit,
catena
involving
other
individual
who
had
exactly
the
same
problem
and
the
i
think
that
the
opinion
by
chief
judge
sykes
in
that
case
is
certainly
applicable
here.
chief
judge
sykes
says
that
the
defendant
is
in
a
worst
position
or
stated
differently.
he
is
not
in
the
same
position
as
though
he
had
not
testified
because
once
the
district
attorney
would
have
that
compelled
testimony,
the
district
attorney
would
be
able
to
use
that
compelled
testimony
in
cross
examination.
and
chief
judge
sykes
says
even
if
there
were
no
over
reference
to
the
compelled
testimony,
the
questions
could
be
phrased
in
such
a
way
that
the
use
of
the
compelled
testimony
would
necessarily
impeach
and
damage
the
defendant.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
yes,
chief
justice.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
i
am
not
certain
that
i
understand
the
question
but
if
i
do,
as
i
understand
the
use
immunity,
it
would
be
of
no
avail
to
the
defendant
facing
the
prosecution
to
raise
it
all
over
again
because
it
could
be
used
--
mr.
michael
a.
querques
well,
i
think
that
question
is
also
answered
by
judge
sykes
and
that
argument
goes
along
these
lines.
that
the
defendant,
even
if
assured
that
the
answers
he
gave
in
the
compelled
testimony
before
the
grand
jury
or
before
a
commission
would
not
be
used.
nonetheless,
it
would
bear
on
his
mind
and
he
would
therefore
be
influenced
to
forego
and
give
up
or
forsake
that
right
that
he
would
have
to
defend
himself.
and
i
think,
that
is
a
very
crucial
consideration.
leaving
that
answer
and
going
to
the
next
one
that
i
have
in
mind,
and
that
is
the
one
by
justice
brennan
in
the
picarello(ph)
decision
the
dissent,
and
that
would
be
that
the
uncertainties
of
the
fact
finding
process
and
the
hazards
to
the
witness
argue
very
strongly
against
use
immunity.
i
do
not
think
that
anyone
could
argue
against
the
fact
that
the
government
would
have
all
of
the
relevant
evidence,
and
any
of
us
who
had
experience
with
the
government
know
that
they
are
files
and
then
there
are
confidential
files.
many,
many
times,
if
not
indeed
all
the
time.
the
young
district
attorney
trying
a
case
in
the
federal
court
is
completely
unaware
of
so
called
confidential
information
resting
in
the
confidential
file
of
the
secret
service
or
immigration
authorities
or
the
fbi
offices.
and
consequently,
he
is
not
in
a
position
though
the
burden
would
be
on
the
government
to
show
that
the
prosecution
is
untainted.
he
would
be
in
no
position
to
rebut
the
evidence
offered
by
the
government.
in
addition
to
that,
the
best
defense
for
a
person
placed
in
the
situation
where
he
has
to
testify
under
use
immunity
could
never
establish
if
there
was
for
example,
an
accidental
or
an
unrecorded
exchange
of
information
which
somehow
tainted
his
indictment.
there
would
be
no
way
of
showing
that
a
poor
memory
was
attendant
to
the
situation
in
order
to
show
the
taint.
many
times,
and
i
think
that
this
court
has
seen
it
recently
proofs
are
lost
through
either
death,
through
resignation,
through
disability
or
through
retirement.
the
case
that
i
am
thinking
about
is
the
recent
case
out
of
new
york
of
santa
belo
where
one
prosecutor
made
a
so
called
arrangement
with
the
defendant,
and
then
as
a
result
of
leaving
his
position,
another
district
attorney
came
in
and
would
not
honor
the
arrangement
previously
made.
you
could
have
exactly
the
same
situation
here.
one
district
attorney
would
leave
his
office
or
would
die
or
retire,
and
something
that
was
left
behind
could
be
used
by
someone
else
and
the
defendant
could
never
establish
it
because
of
that
situation.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
yes,
he
did
your
honor.
but
i
think—
mr.
michael
a.
querques
yes
sir.
but
i
think
in
this
situation,
i
would
ask
you
to
understand
that
it
gets
more
difficult.
we
have
a
situation
here
where
the
years
may
go
by
and
santa
belo,
you
have
in
a
direct
appeal
immediately
following
the
so
called
reneging
on
the
bargain
and
he
could
do
it
with
a
great
deal
or
more
expedition
that
put
a
man
in
this
particular
situation.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
it
is
not
in
the
briefs
your
honor
because
it
was
decided
after
we
filed
a
brief.
the
name
of
the
case
is
catena
against
the
very
same
commission
involved
in
this
case.
i
am
sorry,
i
understand
now
that
is
captured
in
the
name
of
the
warden
of
the
institution
whose
name
would
be
albert
elias.
so,
it
is
catena
against
elias.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
it
is
decided
your
honor,
pleases
on
september
2,
1971.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
i
am
sorry
mr.
justice
white?
mr.
michael
a.
querques
yes.
pending
the
outcome
of
this
case.
while
none
of
the
case
is
referred
to
the
next
point
i
would
like
to
make,
to
me
as
i
review
the
matter,
it
seems
to
be
of
great
importance
and
that
is
this.
a
defendant
placed
in
this
situation
could
never
rebut
the
government’s
assertion
that
his
prosecution
is
untainted.
if
indeed,
there
was
some
collusion
or
some
chicanery
between
one
jurisdiction
and
another,
or
between
one
particular
district
attorney
and
another.
professor
mansfield
points
up
another
reason
for
indicating
that
a
witness
would
be
much
worst
off,
and
that
is
this
argument
that
upon
disclosure
by
a
person
that
he
or
she
committed
a
particular
offense,
the
district
attorney
once
knowing
of
the
commission
of
that
offense
by
this
particular
individual.
i
would
feel
would
be
compelled
or
forced
to
go
out
and
make
the
case
or
be
it
he
would
try
to
make
it
independently.
so,
you
therefore
had
an
individual
who
before
he
gave
the
testimony,
compelled
as
it
is
would
be
able
to
go
to
sweep
at
night
knowing
that
there
was
no
concerted
effort
to
have
him
indicted
or
as
once
he
gave
the
compelled
testimony,
he
had
to
go
to
sweep
each
and
every
night
knowing
that
that
district
attorney
had
sent
his
investigators
out
into
the
field
to
make
a
case
and
not
to
rest
until
they
made
a
case.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
i
am
sorry
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
am
arguing
against
use
immunity.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
that
you
were
giving
this
--
mr.
michael
a.
querques
but
we
were
given
immunity
from
prosecution.
i
would
not
make
the
argument
because
then
the
district
attorney
would
be
wasting
his
time
by
still
trying
to
go
out
there
and
make
a
case.
the
man
had
immunity
from
prosecution.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
he
would
know
he
could—
mr.
michael
a.
querques
i
think
he
would,
yes.
i
think
he
would.
and
if
you
look
at
it
in
this
page,
there
maybe
more
light
on
that.
take
the
situation
where
the
prosecutor
is
asking
a
question
in
the
case
where
he
anticipates
only
one
defendant.
let
us
take
for
example
a
rape
case.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
there
is
only
one
defendant.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
if
there
is
only
one
defendant,
what
possible
reason
would
he
have
under
a
use
immunity
statute
plus
proofs
to
interrogate
that
individual?
if
he
did
want
to
use
the
answer
somehow
to
the
benefit
of
he
himself
the
prosecutor.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
true.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
no.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
no,
that
is
correct.
but
when
we
are
talking
about
use
immunity
statutes,
i
think
that
we
have
to
include
the
individual
cases,
as
well
as
the
so
called
conspiracy
or
multiple
defendant
cases
because
in
my
honest
judgment,
there
such
a
statute
will
be
used
in
both
kinds
of
cases.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
i
think
it
would
more
often
be
used
mr.
chief
justice
in
the
multiple
defendant
type
case,
but
i
also
believe
that
it
would
also
be
used
in
the
individual
defendant.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
yes,
i
will.
i
think
in
the
rape
that
i
have
mentioned
or
if
there
were
a
robbery
which
was
carried
off
by
a
single
individual.
if
there
were
a
murder,
it
was
perpetrated
by
a
single
individual.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
that
is
exactly
my
point,
that
if
called
a
man
under
a
use
immunity
statute
and
he
interrogated
him,
he
would
not
be
giving
him
anything
because
he
could
still
prosecute
the
individual.
so
therefore,
if
he
called
him
in,
he
must
have
had
some
evil
motive
on
his
mind,
viz-a-viz
that
particular
defendant.
if
he
knew
that
only
one
man
committed
the
crime
and
he
called
in
a
single
individual
and
questioned
him
under
use
immunity,
that
prosecutor
knows
that
he
ultimately
came
into
independent
evidence,
he
could
indict
that
individual.
whereas,
he
would
not
do
it
if
he
had
the
transactional
type
of
immunity.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
i
certainly
do.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
that
would
depend
upon
the
facts
but,
if
there
is
stimulation,
and
i
would
concede
that
there
would
be
some
depending
upon
the
personality
of
the
particular
district
attorney.
the
stipulation
in
such
a
case
would
be
much,
much
more
mile
than
the
kind
of
stimulation
that
would
occur
if
under
one
of
these
use
immunity
statutes.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
the
prosecutor
ended
up
with
a
confession.
i
would
think,
mr.
justice
white,
that
any
prosecutor
under
a
use
immunity
statute.
who
had
in
effect
a
confession
from
the
witness
that
he
called
in
would
be
obliged
to
go
out
and
try
to
make
a
case.
i
can't
imagine
sitting
back
and
saying
i
have
a
transcript
wherein
a
admits
murder
and
yet,
i
am
not
going
to
do
anything
about
it,
by
making
an
independent
case.
so
a
as
much
worst
off.
we
come
to
another
consideration
which
i
think
probably
is
the
most
crucial
of
all,
it
is
the
one
that
disturbs
me
as
a
lawyer
the
most,
and
that
is
subjecting
a
witness
to
this
cruel
trilemma
referred
to
by
justice
brennan
of
perjury,
self
accusation
or
contempt,
and
i
have
analyzed
the
situation
and
come
to
this
conclusion.
that
if
a
person
--
mr.
michael
a.
querques
mr.
justice
white,
i
am
sorry.
i
did
not
hear
the
question.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
yes.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
except
that
here
there
is
a
particular
flavor
to
it
because
of
these
trilemma
that
is
forced
by
the
witness.
i
would
think
that
the
self
accusation
or
confession
situation
is
the
least
likely
to
occur.
because
i
think
that
that
is
the
one
that
a
witness
would
want
to
avoid
the
most,
confessing
to
the
crime.
i
would
think
on
the
other
hand
that
the
one
most
likely
to
occur
would
be
that
he
would
elect
because
he
is
forced
to
testify
to
commit
perjury.
i
can
concede
he
may
give
a
false
alibi
or
some
other
story.
that
is
a
white
color
crime,
say
he
did
not
have
criminal
knowledge
or
willful
intent
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
statute.
i
could
even
concede
that
he
might
plead
and
trap.
but
in
any
event,
i
see
that
he
would
setup
some
perjurious
story,
so
that
would
not
have
to
confess
and
at
the
same
time,
he
would
not
have
to
go
to
jail
for
contempt.
i
think
it
is
fairly
likely
that
the
person
who
would
not
want
to
accuse
himself
and
at
the
same
time
would
not
want
to
run
the
risk
of
perjury
would
do
this.
he
would
say,
for
example,
there
are
two
years
or
maybe
three
years
left
before
the
statute
of
limitations
expires.
and
so,
i
will
take
the
contempt
and
have
myself
incarcerated,
and
wade
out
the
statute
of
limitations
because
it
is
easier
to
wade
out
a
two
or
three
year-balance
on
the
statute
of
limitations.
than
it
would
be
to
face
the
indictment
and
prosecution
and
then
perhaps
do
10,
20
or
30
years
in
jail.
now
because,
that
situation
will
occur
and
it
will
occur
in
every
single
case
where
use
immunity
is
used,
the
witness
will
have
to
make
a
choice
of
one
of
those
three,
there
is
no
other
choice.
i
say
most
respectfully
that
the
state,
the
federal
government
or
whoever
it
maybe
is
doing
something
very,
very
distasteful,
and
something
very,
very
contrary
to
the
american
concept
of
justice.
because
it
is,
actually
inducing
or
coercing
a
crime
to
take
place
which
has
not
yet
taken
place
to
it
the
crime
of
perjury.
if
that
is
not
the
result,
the
result
is
that
the
man
goes
to
jail
for
contempt,
that
is
also
foreign
to
our
system
of
justice
because
you
call
on
a
suspect,
he
refuses
to
answer
the
questions,
and
he
ends
up
in
jail
for
contempt
whereas
he
should
have
ended
up
in
jail,
only
if
the
state
in
shouldering
its
responsibility,
made
an
accusation
by
way
of
indictment
and
produced
evidence
in
court
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
i
also
wonder
as
to
what
role
we
lawyers
would
play
in
such
a
situation
and
i
think,
most
respectfully
that
lawyers
would
be
compelled
almost
to
abandon
a
client.
i
can't
imagine
that
a
lawyer
would
feel
at
all
comfortable
with
a
witness
facing
this
trial
on
him.
speaking
for
myself
and
many
others
like
me,
you
would
be
most
uncomfortable
sitting
next
to
a
client
knowing
that
that
client
has
confessed.
there
is
one
case
in
this
court
that
in
essence
says
“a
lawyer
who
tells
his
client
to
cooperate
and
give
up
all
his
rights
is
in
worth
his
soul”.
i
would
not
feel
like
i
were
worth
my
soul
if
told
a
man
to
give
a
confession
rather
than
require
the
state
to
prove
its
case.
the
witness
sitting
in
that
chair
on
the
use
immunity
is
sitting
and
let
me
call
it
a
“warm
chair”.
the
chair
next
to
him
occupied
by
the
lawyer
is
just
as
warm
for
the
lawyer
indeed
it
might
be
very,
very
warm,
it
might
be
hot.
because
the
lawyer
would
have
to
be
concerned
that
if
his
client
took
the
second
choice
to
with
perjury,
the
lawyer
might
ultimately
be
accused
of
suborning
that
perjury.
and
if
we
get
down
to
the
third
possibility
and
that
is
contempt,
the
lawyer
then
really
is
useless
to
the
client
because
if
the
client
says
to
the
lawyer
under
this
situation,
i
am
going
to
do
sometime
in
jail
until
the
statute
of
limitations
runs
out.
there
is
not
anything
that
the
lawyer
can
do
for
him.
so,
i
say
for
these
reasons
and
many
others
which
i
do
not
have
time
to
elucidate
on
and
hopefully
some
of
the
other
lawyers
who
appear
in
the
cases
will.
that
transactional
immunity
as
it
presently
stands
should
remain,
that
use
immunity
is
very,
very
foreign
to
our
system
of
justice
and
will
work
such
hazards,
and
will
work
such
injustices
as
time
will
prove
if
it
ever
comes
to
be.
thank
you.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
respond
just
for
a
few
moment
as
if
i
have
not
left
to
of
what
you
think
that
mr.
phelan
said.
mr.
justice
white
asked
mr.
phelan
or
whether
or
not
indeed
the
state
of
new
jersey
wanted
to
retain
the
right
to
prosecute
the
man
who
was
called
about
the
very
matters
about
what
he
was
questioned.
and
mr.
phelan
said
to
the
court
that
his
commission
had
no
prosecutorial
responsibility.
while
that
is
true,
it
is
also
true
under
their
statute
that
they
are
obliged
to
disseminate
the
information
which
they
obtained
from
question
for
the
local
prosecutors
who
are
21
in
number,
for
the
state
attorney
general’s
office,
and
to
the
federal
authorities.
in
short,
anybody
who
might
be
able
to
use
it.
mr.
phelan
indicated
that
this
statute
comes
in
handy
and
discovering
evidence
with
respect
to
large
scale
conspiracies
assume
that
to
be
true.
i
do
believe
that
it
is
asking
for
anything
to
give
a
man
immunity
from
prosecution,
that
he
helps
you
to
solve
a
large
scale
conspiracy
case,
and
gives
testimony
against
seven,
eight,
nine,
10
or
more
co-defendants.
done
everyday,
prosecutors
like
to
do
it,
and
it
would
just
actually
be
a
continuation
of
that
situation.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
that
would
be
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
that
is
a
very
rare
situation,
and
i
would
think
--
mr.
michael
a.
querques
i
would
think
that
they
would
be
full
hardened,
indeed
assuming
that
they
had
an
independent
case,
then
to
call
to
in
the
witness
whom
they
want
to
prosecute.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
he
should
be
permitted
to
use
it.
i
have
no
objection
to
that,
but
i
quickly
point
out
to
the
court
that
he
can
use
it
on
the
transaction
only
he
if
he
could.
because
under
murphy,
mr.
hogan
is
only
barred
from
using
the
fruits,
that
he
has
an
independent
case,
whether
it
be
transactional
immunity
or
use
immunity,
mr.
hogan
can
proceed
with
his
case.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
yes,
i
quite
understand
that
and
for
the
reason
that
indicated
that
i
think,
with
respect
to
the
questioning
jurisdiction,
the
constitutional
standard
is
only
met
when
the
questioning
jurisdiction
gives
prosecutional
immunity
or
absolute
--
mr.
michael
a.
querques
mr.
justice
white,
i
--
mr.
michael
a.
querques
well,
because
mr.
hogan
is
not
bringing
in
that
witness.
he
is
not
making
a
decision—
mr.
michael
a.
querques
if
i
understood
your
question,
it
assume
that—for
example,
a
new
jersey
prosecutor
would
bring
in
a
witness,
and
question—
mr.
michael
a.
querques
yes.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
yes,
because
he
is
not
from
the
questioning
jurisdiction.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
he
has
an
upset
--
upset
the
balance.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
no,
i
do
not
think
--
excuse
me
sir,
i
do
not
you
are
treating
them
differently.
you
are
analyzing
the
situation
to
determine
whether
or
not
that
questioning
prosecutor,
number
1,
knows
what
he
is
doing,
and
you
are
telling
him
in
advance
that
if
you
call
in
mr.
x
and
you
question
him.
you
better
be
prepared
to
give
him
transactional
immunity
because
we
can
bind
you
in
that
way
under
the
united
states
constitution.
on
the
other
hand,
mr.
prosecutor
in
new
york,
we
cannot
bind
you
under
the
constitution
for
giving
prosecutional
immunity,
because
you
did
no
call
in
that
man.
you
did
not
make
a
decision.
so,
we
cannot
bind
your
hand.
we
cannot
tell
you
what
to
do
other
than
to
say
“you
cannot
use
the
proof’s”
or
what
the
prosecutor
in
san
francisco
did.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
i
make
it
just
as
clear
as
i
can.
a
prosecutor
who
does
not
call
in
the
witness
should
not
be
bound
for
the
same
standard
as
the
prosecutor
who
has
plenty
of
time
to
think
about
what
he
is
doing.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
and,
call
then
the
individual.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
not
bound.
san
francisco,
los
angeles,
both
in
california
would
be
bound
sir.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
yes,
i
would
say
he
is
bound,
because
they
are
working
under
one
sovereign.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
but,
he
is
working
in
the
state
that
he
is
working
within
the
same
framework.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
well.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
that
is
one
way
to
look
at
it.
i
cannot
look
at
it
that
way.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
i
do
not
it
should
spare
him,
i
say
it
should
not
induce
him
to
do
it.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
i
would
say
yes,
it
does
to
you
but,
it
does
it
in
a
different
framework.
and,
do
not
lose
sight
of
the
fact
pleas
that
the
defendant
in
the
given
case,
when
he
takes
the
stand,
he
takes
it
knowing
that
he
is
waived
his
right
under
the
fifth
amendment,
whereas
the
follow
who
is
sitting
home
having
dinner
one
evening
and
receives
a
subpoena,
he
has
not
elected
to
take
the
stand.
he
is
compelled
to
take
the
witness
chair,
whether
it
be
grand
jury
or
sci
or
anything
else,
there
is
that
crucial
difference.
mr.
michael
a.
querques
i
would
conceive
to
you
that
once
the
defendant
in
a
trial
elects
to
take
the
stand,
he
yes,
is
under
pressure.
but
the
pressure
to
begin
with,
is
a
lot
less,
and
it
is
a
pressure
that
he
is
wiling
to
take,
and
it
is
a
pressure
against
which
he
has
no
constitutional
guarantee.
he
has
waived
that
constitutional
guarantee
by
walking
into
chair.
the
man
that
we
are
talking
about
has
not
waved
anything.
they
have
forced
him
into
the
chair
and
enforcing
him
into
the
chair,
they
forced
him
into
that
trilemmic
situation,
which
he
cannot
live
with,
his
lawyer
cannot
live
with
and
i
say
that
this
society
should
not
live
with
it.
