how
much
weight
do
you
put
on
this
extraordinary
situation
in
1968
just
to
find
the
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
let
me
ask--
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
still
in
effect,
the
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
kind
of
got
there.
either
you
have
an
emergency
situation
in
'68.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
do
you
still
have
the
commission?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
statute
is
being
in
effect?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
my
whole
point
is
what
is
the
great
value
of
what
happened
in
'68?
to
me
as
continuous
statute
as
of
right
now.
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
the
problem
disappeared,
would
the
statute
be
repealed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
are
not
right
when
you
say
it
is
a
good
statute,
now
it
is
good
as
long
as
you
care
to
use.
justice
thurgood
marshall

well
then.
