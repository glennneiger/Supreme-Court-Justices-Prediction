mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
but,
your
honor
i
believe
that
my
argument
earlier
were
pertained
equally
to
this
case
as
it
did
to
the
former
case,
the
general
question
of
whether
a
constitutional
privilege
should
be
recognized
in
first
amendment.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
no,
i
really
contend
that
--
merely
to
make
a
couple
of
additional
observations
the
--
noting
that
my
former
argument
applies
here
equally.
our
position
is
of
course
that
no
constitutional
privilege
exist
in
the
first
amendment
now
and
when
should
not
be
recognized.
i
think
a
point
that
should
be
brought
out
is
that
even
apart
from
that
the
arguments
in
this
case
is
talking
about
a
constitutional
privilege
focused
on
a
particular
test
of
some
showing
that
the
government
must
make.
generally,
a
balancing
test,
that
is
exceedingly
difficult
to
apply,
a
balancing
test
which
is
found
nowhere
with
respect
to
any
other
personal
privileges
pertaining
to
personal
relationships.
particularly,
a
distinction
is
made
between
serious
and
less
serious
crimes
between
what
are
called
major
crimes
or
victimless
crime,
i
believe
that’s
how
it’s
characterized
in
the
briefs.
a
distinction
which
as
far
as
i
can
determine
is
wholly
detached
from
legislative
judgment
that
if
congress
is
seen
fit
to
make
a
victimless
crime
as
it’s
referred
to,
that
a
crime
as
a
matter
of
determination
--
their
legislative
determination
and
its
constitutional,
we
see
no
basis
for
drawing
lines
in
formulating
some
constitutional
rule
which
would
distinguish
between
something
that
is
a
major
crime
as
opposed
to
a
victimless
crime.
also,
this
rule
turns
on
a
showing
by
the
government
that
no
other
sources
of
information
are
available.
but
suppose
you
have
an
informer
who’s
unreliable
and
you
want
to
call
a
reporter
in
order
to
show
reliability
or
suppose
the
informer
is
in
fact
reliable
but
he
would
make
a
bad
witness.
is
this
a
situation
where
we
should
say
that
there
are
no
other
sources
available?
and
that,
what
about
the
whole
notion
of
cumulative
evidence
and
the
importance
of
that
and
how
is
a
judge
to
measure
whether
or
not
cumulative
evidence
is
or
is
not
important
in
determining
function
of
the
grand
jury.
i
take
that
this
are
extremely
difficult
questions
in
trying
to
formulate
a
test
of
a
nature
that’s
proposed
is
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law.
and
then
moreover,
its
as
mr.
prettyman
has
pointed
out
the
balancing
test
is
one
that
turns
on
the
particular
facts
of
each
case,
and
ad
hoc
test,
which
seems
to
suggest
that
there
would
always
be
a
litigable
issue
involved
resulting
in
a
substantial
and
considerable
delay.
and
that
such
delays
we
feel
make
an
important
difference
when
you're
talking
about
the
grand
jury
process.

of
limitations

you
have
problems
of
questions
of

trial
and

of

nature
which
make
a
difference,
a
substantial
difference
when
you're
talking
about
a

as
opposed
to
an
investigation
by
a
legislative
committee
where
it
is
looking
into
the
matters

result

legislation
and
seems
that
those
considerations
are
important
ones
when
you're
trying
to
formulate
some
kind
of
a
constitutional
test.
i
will
just
point
out
that
such
delays
can
be
avoided
and
probably
would
be
avoided
under
the
guidelines
of
the
attorney
general
as
proposed.
