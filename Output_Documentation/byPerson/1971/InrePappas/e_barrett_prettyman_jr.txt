mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
paul
pappas.
this
is
the
third
case
in
the
trilogy
now,
before
the
court
involving
the
first
amendment,
a
newsman.
the
facts
in
the
case
are
relatively
simple.
mr.
pappas
is
an
experienced,
professional
newsman-photographer
for
wtev-tv
and
with
its
principal
offices
in
new
bedford,
massachusetts.
the
station
covers
all
of
rhode
island,
part
of
massachusetts,
part
of
connecticut.
on
july
30,
1970,
he
was
in
providence,
rhode
island,
when
he
received
a
call
from
his
station,
telling
him
to
go
to
new
bedford.
they
seemed
to
be
burning
down
new
bedford,
was
the
message
that
he
got,
they
were
not
identified.
he
went
to
new
bedford,
to
the
west
end
of
the
town
where
apparently
that’s
his
orders
had
been
described
for
him
and
he
there
ran
into
a
barricade.
he
therefore
returned
to
the
new
bedford
office,
after
which
he
received
another
call,
from
his
superiors
telling
him
that
he
went
back
to
the
area,
he
would
be
allowed
into
the
area
through
the
barricade.
he
returned
and
he
set
up
his
cameras
outside
a
boarded-up
variety
store,
which
apparently
was
being
used
as
headquarters
for
the
black
panthers.
he
set
up
his
camera
and
a
spokesman
for
the
panthers
came
out
of
the
store
with
about
a
dozen
blacks.
they
gathered
and
the
spokesman
gave
a
press
interview.
there
were
approximately
five
newsmen
present,
including
mr.
pappas.
all
of
the
films
which
mr.
pappas
took
of
the
news
conference
were
subsequently
given
to
and
viewed
by
the
district
attorney.
the
next
sequence
of
facts
which
actually
gave
rise
to
this
case
were
prompted
by
two
occurrences.
first,
during
the
news
conference,
the
spokesman
said
that
the
police
would
be
allowed
into
the
store
if
they
had
search
warrants,
if
they
conducted
themselves
in
a
gentlemanly
manner
and
if
they
were
accompanied
by
the
news
media.
the
second
occurrence
was
that
at
a
kind
of
side
conference
after
the
spokesman
has
gotten
through
with
this
more
formal
press
conference,
the
panthers
complained
to
mr.
pappas
that
the
news
media
always
covered
the
side
of
the
police
in
circumstances
such
as
these.
and
on
this
point,
mr.
pappas
said,
“well,
that’s
because
the
media
are
never
allowed
to
show
any
other
side.”
now
it
was
as
a
result
of
these
two
occurrences
that
the
panthers
then
agreed
with
mr.
pappas
that
he
would
be
allowed
into
their
headquarters
that
evening,
to
spend
the
night
if
he
wished,
if
he
came
back
personally,
but
there
was
a
condition.
if
there
was
a
raid,
they
said,
he
would
be
allowed
to
report
and
photograph
anything
that
took
place.
on
the
other
hand,
if
there
was
no
raid,
there
was
no
raid,
any
as
he
put
it
anything
i
saw
or
heard
would
be
strictly
in
confidence.
later
that
night,
after
he
had
been
accompanied
back
to
and
into
the
headquarters,
these
conditions
were
reimposed.
they
were
specifically
stated
again
and
he
again
agreed
to
them.
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
was
adverse
comment
about
whether
he
might
not
be
a
police
stoolie
and
he
assured
them
no,
he
was
there
as
a
representative
of
the
press.
he
understands
he
was
that
if
there
was
a
police
raid,
he
was
free
to
cover
it.
if
there
was
no
police
raid,
he
would
keep
whatever
he
saw
or
heard
in
confidence.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
think
the
privilege
would
come
into
play.
i
think
that
in
the
subsequent
hearing,
on
whether
they
were
overriding
public
interest
in
the
production
of
his
testimony,
it
might
well
sway
the
court
that
he
saw
during
the
period
of
confidentiality
and
privilege
and
of
that
which
was
so
vital
to
the
public
interest
that
he
should
be
required
to
testify,
anyway.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
this
is
precisely,
your
honor,
why
we
suggest
to
you
that
there
must
be
a
balancing
test
and
this
is
one
of
the
factors
that
undoubtedly
a
judge
would
take
into
consideration
in
determining
where
the
balance
lies
in
this
particular
case.
how
serious
was
the
event
that
he
saw?
was
there
any
other
source
for
getting
the
information?
what
was
the
public
interest
in
it?
did
he
in
fact
have
the
relevant
information,
and
so
forth.
these
are
the
very
factors
that
a
court
would
consider
in
determining
whether
he
should
be
made
to
testify.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
precisely.
so
long
as
he
was
there
and
this
occurred
during
the
period
when
the
privilege
was
in
effect.
now,
the
period
here,
we
must
remember
went
into
effect
when
he
went
into
the
headquarters,
not
beforehand.
and
up
until
the
time
that
there
was
a
police
raid,
when
all
restrictions
were
on.
if
anything
occurred
inside
there,
then
that
was
privileged
but
the
court
might
well
find,
in
a
given
circumstance,
that
the
public
interest
overrode
the
privilege,
as
it
does
any
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
the
relationship
of
confidentiality
that
can
come
into
effect
for
any
number
of
reasons.
i
can
only
say
here
that
while
he
apparently,
so
far
as
the
records
shows,
did
not
have
a
long
acquaintanceship
with
the
people.
there
obviously
was
something
about
his
demeanor
and
his
seriousness
at
the
time
of
the
press
conference
which
made
them
believe
that
they
could
trust
this
man.
they
did
not
give
the
same
privilege
to
the
other
five
newsmen
who
were
present.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
general
rule
that
i
would
lay
down,
mr.
justice
white
is
that
there
is
a
privilege
and
that
there
is
a
presumption
that
the
newsman
is
protected
and
then
and
only
then
can
the
government
come
in
with
its
burden
and
attempt
to
carry
it
by
showing
the
various
of
elements
that
we
have
outlined
in
our
brief.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
let
me
emphasize.
first
of
all,
that
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
in
this
record
of
any
crime
occurring
during
these
three
hours.
i
want
to
make
that
clear,
because
this
is
not
a
criminal
case.
secondly,
assuming
that
there
was
a
crime
then
i
would
say
that
they
have
to
show
that
the
grand
jury
is
investigating
a
specific
crime.
i
would
say
they
would
show
that
he
had
at
least
probable
cause
to
believe
that
he
had
information
relating
to
that
crime.
number
three,
that
there
was
no
other
available
source
for
receiving,
obtaining
the
same
information.
and
finally,
that
there
was,
as
this
court
put
it
in
gibson,
an
overriding
interest
on
the
part
of
the
public
in
obtaining
that
information.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no
sir.
in
my
view,
it
would
not.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
do.
i
confess
that
a
rule
could
be
fashion
that
wouldn’t.
in
my
own
view,
i
think
for
example
to
take
the
branzburg
case
that
it’s
more
vital
that
the
public
know
that
a
youngster
can
get
a
drink
in
that
community,
far
harder
that
he
can
get
pot.
he
can
get
pot
virtually
by
asking
for
it
and
then,
he
can’t
get
a
drink.
i
think
it’s
more
important
that
the
public
know
that
and
that
those
boys
be
prosecuted.
on
the
other
hand,
i
can
well
see
that
in
a
murder
case,
in
a
desperate
crime
situation,
that
the
interest
might
apply
other
way.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
there’s
the
same
degree
of
predictability
as
there
is
in
a
prior
restraint
case.
there
--
in
a
prior
restraint
case
you
do
have
your
exceptions,
but
the
fact
is,
that
a
99%
of
the
cases,
there
can
be
no
prior
restraint
and
here
i
would
say
that
the
predictability
comes
because
a
99%
of
the
case,
the
privilege
stands
and
the
prosecutors
know
that
and
they’re
not
going
to
issue
the
subpoenas
unless
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
it
has
even
without
privilege
in
many
instances
before,
as
was
pointed
out
this
morning.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
am
afraid
your
honor
that
if
the
privilege
was
stricken
we
would
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
we
would
[laughter
attempt]
if
it
was
not
allowed,
[laughter]
we
would
have
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
we
would
have
a
more
serious
situation.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
your
honor,
if
you
will
look
at
the
caldwell
subpoena
you
will
see
specific
crimes
set
out
that
the
grand
jury
were
investigating.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
would
turn
to
our
single
appendix,
on
the
first
page,
you
will
see
that
the
subpoena
orders
mr.
pappas
to
appear
and
there
to
give
such
evidence
as
he
knows,
relating
to
any
matters,
which
may
be
inquired
of
or
on
behalf
of
the
commonwealth
before
said
grand
jury.
now,
the
masters
of
supreme
judicial
court
has
said
that
mr.
pappas
carries
a
burden
to
show
that
the
grand
jury
inquiry
is
improper
or
oppressive.
i
would
like
anyone
to
tell
me
how
we
can
show
that
this
is
an
improper
or
oppressive
grand
jury
inquiry
when
we
don’t
even
know
what
in
the
world
they’re
investigating.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
my
answer
is
that
while
it’s
quite
true
that
in
many
instances
the
grand
jury
will
go
from
one
crime
to
another
or
will
go
from
suspicion
to
fact
that
where
you
have
first
amendment
privilege
involved,
the
heavy
duty
involved
in
the
prosecution
in
trammeling
on
that
privilege
that
there,
there
is
a
duty
to
indicate
that
kind
of
situation
that
they’re
inquiring
into.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
you
don’t
do
that,
you’re
not
even
sure
whether
the
privilege
covers
the
precise
situation
that
you're
looking
into.
for
example,
if
i
might
just
--
if
it
turns
out
that
what
they
are
really
investigating
here
was
something
that
happened
on
june
8,
when
these
disorders
apparently
were
going
on
as
opposed
to
july
30,
that
would
be
an
entirely
situation
and
if
they
were
looking
into
something
which
they
think
happened
during
the
three
hours
that
he
present
in
the
headquarters.
i
think,
there’s
a
duty
and
a
burden
upon
them
to
come
forward
with
an
indication
of
what
it
is
that
they’re
investigating.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
if
they
cited
a
statute
that
they
said
was
violated
and
gave
a
period
of
time
and
a
place
when
it
was
suppose
to
have
occurred,
i
would
say
yes,
it
would
meet
my
definition.
i
would
like
to
point
out
here,
just
by
way
of
example
that
the
massachusetts
supreme
court
took
judicial
notice
of
the
fact,
there
was
gun
fire,
but
they
never
said
when,
where,
by
whom,
and
certainly
didn’t
say
that
it
had
taken
place
during
the
three
hours
he
was
there.
this
is
a
kind
of
danger
i
don’t
think
you
run
into
if
you
don’t
have
some
specificity
in
regard
to
subpoenaing
newsman
before
a
grand
jury.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
it’s
my
understanding
that
while
sometimes
they
are
more
specific
that
this
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
this
is
in
--
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
on
a
form,
your
honor,
because
it
has
a
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
it
has
--
as
you’ll
see
it
has
a
blank
space
said,
blank
or
the
grand
jury
and
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
your
honor,
it
was
not
argued
below
in
this
case,
that
the
man
did
not
have
to
appear
before
the
grand
jury.
i
would
point
to
you
however,
that
if
there
was
ever
a
case,
where
his
appearance
would
be
a
useless
act,
it
would
be
this
one,
for
this
reason.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
but,
that
would
not
have
been
received
in
confidence
mr.
justice.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no
sir,
i
quite
disagree,
he
would
go.
and
he
would
be
required
to
give
testimony
like
anyone
else.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
no
i
was
raising
the
generality
of
the
subpoena
only
in
relation
to
the
specific
confidentiality
that
has
been
imposed
upon
him.
what
i
say
is
that
in
view
of
the
fact
that
once
the
confidentiality
is
imposed,
you
therefore
run
right
smack
into
your
first
amendment
problem,
that
the
ordinary
duty
of
the
commonwealth
to
simply
order
a
--
to
issue
a
general
subpoena,
must
go
by
the
boards,
because
then,
since
your
entrenching
on
first
amendment
rights,
they
have
got
to
be
more
specific
and
carry
more
of
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
because,
the
judge
is
going
to
have
to
make
a
decision
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
balancing
the
various
interest
as
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
because,
your
honor,
he
is
obtaining
information
for
the
public
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
think
you
have
to
give
him
a
hearing,
because
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
merely
because
he
is
part
of
the
press,
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
who
has
received
information
in
order
to
get
a
dissemination
of
information
to
the
public
and
without
this
kind
of
showing.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
he
is
asserts
it
in
the
same
way
that
a
grand
jury
doesn’t
know
that
a
fellow
is
going
to
play
the
bet
until
he
plays
it
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
your
honor,
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly,
what
he
saw
was
not
protected
by
the
privilege,
because
he
did
not
receive
it
in
his
direction.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
and
he
stands
in
the
shoes
of
any
other
man.
the
problem
arises
only,
when
as
a
newsman
in
an
attempt
to
gather,
edit,
analyze,
write
and
disseminate
information
to
the
public
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
yes.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
the
fact
remains
your
honor
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
he
does
your
honor,
and
i
can
only
reiterate
that
the
privilege
comes
into
effect
when
he
is
obtaining
information
in
confidentiality
from
sources
which
busted
the
confidentiality,
he
would
never
receive
his
story
and
the
public
would
never
receive
the
story.
let
us
take
this
particular
case
for
example,
let’s
assume
there
had
been
a
police
raid
this
night.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
police
raid
would
never
have
been
covered
from
the
inside,
except
for
this
agreement
of
confidentiality.
the
public
would
never
have
received
the
story
about
that
police
raid
from
anybody’s
viewpoint
other
than
the
police.
now,
it
so
happens
that
the
panthers
wanted
their
side,
at
least
told
for
once
not
in
a
prejudice
sense,
but
to
have
somebody
not
just
take
the
word
for
the
police
as
to
what
had
happened.
and
they
noticed
they
paid
no
restriction
upon
him
in
regard
to
his
reporting
of
the
police
raid.
you
are
free
to
report
it
anywhere
you
want
to,
to
photograph
anything
you
want
to.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i
can
only
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
sir.
unless
he
received
the
information
in
confidence
and
were
in
the
instance
that
you
posed
you
did
not
say
that
an
element
of
confidence
was
imposed
upon.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
alright,
now
there
is
a
lot
of
information,
your
honor,
which
in
this
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
can
i
draw
this
distinction
for
you?
a
reporter
goes
to
a
public
press
conference
by
the
president
of
the
united
states.
he
is
there
like
any
other
reporter,
no
confidence
applies
--
confidentiality
applies.
he,
like
a
reporter,
he’s
like
everybody
else,
except
that
he
is
reporting,
the
story
goes
out.
the
next
day,
the
president
calls
the
reporter
in
and
he
says,
“i
would
like
this
off
the
record,
but
i’m
not
sure
that
you
fully
understood
the
point
that
i
was
trying
to
make
and
i
want
to
give
you
an
in
depth
look,
so
that
in
your
future
reporting,
even
though
you
do
not
report
what
i
said
that
you
will
understand
and
have
a
depth
of
knowledge
about
this
that
will
make
your
reporting
to
the
public
more
meaningful”
and
he
therefore
gives
him
a
story.
now,
i
say,
without
relevance
to
the
presidency,
i
say
that
the
confidentiality
having
been
imposed
that
the
only
way
a
grand
jury
is
going
to
get
out
of
him
what
the
president
had
told
him
is
if
it
showed
an
overriding
public
need
for
that
information,
because
the
element
of
confidentiality
that
establish
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i
am
sorry
if
i
haven’t
satisfied
you,
i
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that’s
right.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
only
if
he
has
information,
which
he
received
in
confidence,
perhaps
we
can
--
perhaps
i
can
satisfy
you
by
analogizing
with
the
fifth
amendment.
you
and
i
both
go
before
the
grand
jury,
but
it
so
happens
i
am
implicated
in
the
crime.
now,
we
are
both
are
obligated
to
testify,
in
the
sense
that
we
both
saw
the
same
thing.
but,
the
fact
is
that
as
soon
as
i
plead
my
fifth
amendment
right,
i
can
then
have
a
court
determine
whether
i
am
properly
pleading
it.
when
i
come
out
of
your
category,
and
i
am
separate
from
you.
i
am
distinct,
because
the
constitution
coverage
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
can
i
put
the
appearance
before
the
grand
jury
to
one
side,
because
the
problem
is
that
i
--
we
did
not
argue
this
below.
and
while
i
do
want
to
say
that
since
the
only
information
that
the
grand
jury
is
apparently
seeking
is
the
information
that
he
acquire
during
the
three
hours
of
confidentiality.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
oh!
yes.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
absolutely.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
am
sorry,
i
didn’t
make
that
clear.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that’s
correct.
i
think
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that’s
correct.
i
do
think
i’d
be
misleading
you
if
i
didn’t
make
two
points
about
it
though,
number
one,
is
that
it
would
be
a
total
useless
act
for
him
to
appear
and
i
am
not
in
favor
of
putting
the
man
at
the
grand
jury
room
for
a
totally
useless
act.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
he
did
appear
once,
correct.
the
other
point
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
correct.
the
other
point
is
that
in
view
of
what
the
caldwell
court
said
about
the
black
panthers
that
would
be
equally
applicable
here,
that
is
if
he
disappeared
again
in
to
the
grand
jury.
well,
it
might
be
that
a
number
of
things
could
happen,
including
his
personal
safety,
as
he
testifies.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
he’d
do
it
once.
absolutely.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
your
honor,
when
we
get
away
from
the
grand
jury,
there
may
be
other
considerations
applicable
and
i
am
not
attempting
the
day
to
set
down
a
set
of
criteria
for
trial
[voice
overlap]
legislature--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
but
--
yes,
that’s
absolutely
right.
what
happens,
as
we
see
it
is
this,
that
when
he’s
called
before
the
grand
jury
and
the
questions
begin
about
--
well,
as
in
this
case,
what
did
you
see
and
hear
during
your
three
hours
in
the
headquarter?
did
you
see
ammunitions?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
alright,
let’s
take
the
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
recognizing
that
there
may
be
some
distinctions
between
a
legislature
and
so
forth
or
you
now
posed
to
the
grand
jury.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
alright,
the
privilege
applies
and
then
what
happens
is
he
refuses
to
answer
the
question
and
he
goes
before
the
judge.
if
the
prosecutor
persist,
my
feeling
is,
the
prosecutor
wouldn’t
have
called
him
in
the
first
place
or
won’t
persist
if
the
court
rules
the
right
way.
but,
in
any
event,
he
goes
before
the
judge
and
the
judge
says,
as
he
did
in
this
case,
pappas
was
asked
questions
and
he
told
the
circumstance
under
which
the
press
conference,
he
told
the
circumstances
of
his
specific
agreement,
how
he
went
in,
how
he
was
made
the
promise
again,
and
how
he
came
out.
then,
the
judge
having
satisfied
himself
that
in
fact
a
confidentiality
was
imposed
upon
him,
that
he
is
in
fact
a
newsman
during
the
course
of
his
employment
then
i
would
say
that
the
judge
then
turns
to
the
government
or
the
state
and
says,
“alright,
if
you
persist,
you
now
have
the
burden,
because
of
the
first
amendment
situation,
you
now
have
the
burden
to
prove
various
factors.”
what
are
you
investigating?
what
do
you
think
he
knows
about
it?
and,
have
you
gone
every
else
to
tie
to
get
the
same
information.
what
is
really
the
overriding
need
for
this
information
in
this
case?
now,
this
is
not
unique
your
honor,
because
this
is
going
on
right
now,
down
in
the
lower
courts,
its
happening,
we
have
cases
in
our
brief,
dorn
and
rios
and
a
lot
of
others
where
courts
are
doing
this
exact
thing.
the
fellow
who
refused
to
answer
the
question,
the
court
will
take
him
in
and
he’ll
say,
“i
find
under
this
circumstances
that
you're
interest
is
not
sufficient
in
view
of
the
first
amendment
privilege
and
therefore,
the
subpoena
is
quashed.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no
sir,
that
was
--
the
washington
post
did
that
and
the
new
york
times
issued
a
set
of
instructions
by
which
they
use
a
great
deal
of
care
in
discretion
as
to
the
extent
that
they
will
accept
backgrounders.
but
this
is
not
true
of
newspapers
in
general
and
even
with
the
new
york
times,
it’s
not
completely
true.
i
think
you’ll
find
that
confidences
at
every
level
and
particularly
the
governmental
level,
and
particularly
in
regard
to
minority
and
radical
groups
today,
as
professor
blasi’s
report
well
demonstrate
that
the
confidentiality
plays
an
absolutely
vital
role
in
the
gathering
and
dissemination
of
information,
absolutely
essential.
and
mr.
justice
marshall,
you
indicated
that
the
ordinary
man
would
have
to
appear
in
circumstances
as
we’ve
outlined.
the
american
law
institute
model
code
of
evidence
allows
the
following
people
not
to
appear.
there
is
of
course
self-incrimination.
the
attorney,
the
priest,
the
physician,
the
spouse,
religious
beliefs
can’t
be
in
part
in
political
votes,
trade
secrets,
state
secrets,
official
information,
communication
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
your
honor,
i
thought
i
put
that
to
rest,
in
the
sense
that
while
i
do
believe
that
mr.
pappas
should
not
be
made
to
appear.
i
have
to
concede
that
it
was
not
argued
below,
you
understand
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no.
the
argument
has
been
made
by
massachusetts
and
perhaps
suggested
by
the
justice
that
the
ordinary
person
has
to
turn
up
and
testify
and
that
we’re
carving
out
of
that,
out
of
this
inviolate
right
of
the
grand
jury,
some
special
case
were
newsmen
and
all
i’m
showing
it
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
correct,
that’s
absolutely
correct.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
some
are
common
laws,
some
by
statute?
that’s
correct.
in
massachusetts
there
was
a
list,
which
i
won’t
read,
but
which
is
quite
similar
to
the
one
i’ve
just
read.
for
example
like,
physician
doesn’t
have
a
privilege,
but
a
psychotherapist
does.
i
mean,
there
are
all
kinds
of
exceptions
that
people
have
right
now.
so
the
only
point
i’m
making
on
this
that,
is
that
it
isn’t
as
if
we
are
saying
the
newsman
is
the
only
one
out
of
the
population
who
doesn’t
have
to
turn
up
to
testify.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i’m
sorry,
i
didn’t
hear
you.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i
think
it
depends
upon
his
relationship
with
the
party
who
was
injured.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
i
would
certainly
assume.
that
is
correct.
and,
that
is
the
point
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
[laughter]
but
mr.
justice
the
distinction
between
the
physician
is
precisely
the
one
i
was
trying
to
make
a
few
minutes
ago.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
wonder
if
i
can
get
to
the
point
of
mr.
justice
stewart
made
in
the
branzburg
case
about
speech
versus
the
press.
mr.
justice,
i
think
if
these
were
essentially
the
same
interests.
if
they
were
equally
protected,
there
would
be
no
need
for
any
reference
in
the
press,
in
the
constitution
to
the
press
as
such.
the
press
privilege
would
be
covered
by
the
speech
privilege.
i
think
that
the
speech
privilege
is
not
as
broad
as
the
functioning
process
by
which
the
press
operates.
to
put
it
in
another
way
that
the
press
right
is
more
than
a
right
to
speak.
the
mere
right
to
speak
without
being
able
to
obtain
information,
for
example
would
be
a
meaningless
one.
speech
normally
involves
an
individual
or
a
group
attempting
to
express
their
individual
view.
the
press
covers
the
entire
spectrum
of
dissemination
not
only
the
views
of
news,
people,
and
individuals,
but
the
gathering
and
analyzing
and
publishing
over
the
whole
wrap
of
news
that
gets
before
the
public.
i
think
that
our
founding
fathers
recognized
that
it’s
one
thing
just
to
speak
out
but
that
is
also
vitally
important
to
get
the
widest
possible
range
of
information
before
the
public.
and
the
way
to
do
it
is
through
a
free
and
untrammeled
press.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
there
are
situations
where
they
will
not
be
equally
protected.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
perhaps
that’s
a
better
way
of
putting
it,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i
think
television
is
equally
covered
with
--
certainly
encompassed
within
the
press
function.
the
court
has
recognized
that
radio
is.
the
lower
courts
have
recognized
the
television
is.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
anything,
there
should
be
more
of
a
right
rather
than
the
last
one
because
the
figure
shows
that
as
compared
with
the
largest
daily
newspaper’s
circulation
is
some
2
million.
cbs
daily
news,
in
the
evening
has
9
million
viewers
so
that
the
impact
is
far
greater
on
news
dissemination
in
the
television
than
even
the
press.
i
think
it’s
clearly
covered
within
the
privilege.
i
would
like
to
get
back,
if
i
might
to
the
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
your
honor,
the
point
i
made
a
little
while
ago
was
that
when
we
get
the
trials
and
we
recognize
that
all
three
of
these
cases
are
grand
juries,
we
have
the
element
of
secrecy;
we
have
the
element
of
merely
trying
to
determine
whether
there
--
whether
someone
should
be
indicted
and
so
forth.
there
might
be
slightly
different
considerations
that
the
trial
effect
takes
into
consideration
in
balancing
in
a
trial.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
but
the
privilege
would
applied,
would
come
into
effect
and
the
only
way
the
difference
would
be
is
to
trial
compared
with
grand
jury
would
be
as
to
whether
it
might
be
more
important
in
a
particular
trial
to
have
his
testimonies
in
the
grand
jury.
otherwise,
i
think
probably
the
same
applies.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
in
terms
of
his
appearance
before
the
grand
jury,
that’s
correct.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
absolutely,
yes.
you
recognized
that
even
under
the
district
court
order
in
caldwell,
this
case
has
to
be
reversed.
the
state
did
not
put
on
a
single
witness.
it
gave
no
testimony.
it
offered
nothing
of
any
way
at
the
hearing.
the
only
witness
was
mr.
pappas,
who
established
the
confidence.
the
state
not
only
carried
no
burden,
but
massachusetts
said
it
did
not
have
to.
that
there
was
no
right
to
be
recognized
and
consequently,
the
state
carry
no
burden
and
it
said
that
if
we
want
to
prove
that
the
grand
jury
was
oppressive
in
some
fashion
we
would
have
to
do
that.
but
again,
since
we
are
totally
at
a
lost
to
know
what
it
is
that
they
want
and
why,
it’s
impossible
for
us,
obviously
at
this
stage
to
prove
that
this
grand
jury
inquiry
is
oppressive.
there’s
not
a
word,
not
a
word
or
testimony
or
evidence
from
the
state
to
prove
anything
here.
all
we
have
is
a
simple
subpoena
in
the
general
language
that
i’ve
indicated
to
you.
and
in
this
regard
i’d
like
to
relate
--
just
a
moment
to
relate
an
incident
in
the
guest
and
stanzler
argument,
because
to
me
it
drives
on
the
importance
of
what
we’re
talking
to
here.
eugene
patterson
of
the
atlanta
constitution
told
of
an
instance
where
his
paper
did
an
exposé
on
narcotics
in
the
georgia
state
prison
system.
they
got
the
information
from
a
doctor
who
had
worked
there
and
who
insisted
for
obvious
reasons
that
his
information
be
kept
confidential.
the
paper
published
the
exposé
and
immediately
a
grand
jury
was
called.
the
grand
jury
wasn’t
investigating
the
narcotics
in
the
georgia
prison
system.
the
grand
jury
want
to
know
the
doctor’s
name
and
the
publisher
refused
to
produce
the
doctor’s
name.
and
at
the
last
minute,
so
as
to
keep
him
from
going
to
jail,
the
doctor
revealed
his
own
name
and
the
grand
jury
was
dismissed.
now,
that
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
we
face
here
if
you
allow
grand
juries
without
any
sanctions
at
all,
any
control,
any
burden
on
the
government,
simply
to
subpoena
someone
at
will
who
has
received
confidential
information
as
part
of
the
press,
part
of
its
duty
to
disseminate
news
to
the
public.
i’m
not
for
a
moment
condemning
grand
juries
in
general
or
prosecutors
in
general.
all
i’m
saying
is
there
are
too
many
instances
of
abuse
in
the
past
and
potential
abuse
for
the
future
where
a
newsman
can
be
called
as
retaliation
for
a
particular
story,
as
a
warning
not
to
go
to
the
black
panther
headquarters
next
time,
for
political
reasons
or
for
anything
else.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
think
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
in
the
first
place,
i
think
that
the
ability
to
waive
is
on
the
newsman,
so
that
if
he
chose
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
alright,
if
he
chooses
not
to,
i
think
the
privilege
extends
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
your
honor
that’s
a
large
assumption
and
i
am
not
sure
you
can
make
that.
the
point
is
that
having
received
something
in
confident
and
then
having
an
effect
broken
the
confidence
later,
i
think
that
that
newsman’s
effectiveness
could
well
be
[voice
overlap].
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
absolutely,
and
his
whole
ability
to
gather
news
from
whatever
group.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
think
that
the
court
can
establish
a
rule
that
when
a
reporter,
part
of
the
press
protected
by
the
constitution
receives
during
the
course
of
his
news
gathering
duties,
information
in
confidence
that
that
brings
the
first
amendment
into
play
and
he
is
protected
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
but
your
honor,
i
think
in
a
whole
serious
of
cases
the
court
has
done
precisely
that.
i
think
in
lamont,
bantam
books,
bates,
dombrowski,
talley
what
the
court
has
done
is
not
to
say
that
in
this
particular
instance,
there
has
been
a
suppression
of
a
first
amendment
right.
i
think
what
the
court
has
done
in
those
cases
is
to
say
that
if
you
are
going
to
engage
in
the
type
of
governmental
interference
involved
in
those
cases,
it
is
gong
to
have
a
future
chilling
effect.
and
therefore,
i
think
it
is
incumbent
upon
the
court
to
look
about,
look
not
only
to
the
instant
case
but
to
look
at
the
kind
of
abuse
that
could
be
inherent
in
a
refusal
to
recognize
the
privilege.
i
think
certainly,
it
can
look
to
what
is
likely
to
happen
if
you
do
not
establish
the
privilege
here.
you
got
to
remember,
we’re
not
trying
to
set
a
set
rule
here
which
a
newsman
can
for
all
time
and
under
any
circumstances
simply
assert
privilege
and
go
home.
if
he
asserts
it
without
warrant,
if
he
asserts
it
then
the
situation
he
is
not
entitled
to,
that
can
be
determined
by
court
and
that’s
the
kind
of
adjudication
that’s
constantly
going
on
in
all
kinds
of
cases.
but,
yes
i
do
think
that
in
determining
chilling
effect
affect
for
their
future
that
the
court
can
look
at
what
might
well
go
on.
in
the
case,
for
example,
where
the
statute
recall
--
attempted
to
make
a
pamphleteers
name
and
address
appear
on
the
pamphlet,
the
court
didn’t
say
that
in
that
particular
instance,
it
would
hurt
the
individual.
it
said
that
that
would
detour
people
in
the
future
from
engaging
in
this
kind
of
first
amendment
exercise
of
rights.
yes,
i
do
think,
absolutely
that
you
can
look
at
the
kinds
of
abuses
that
not
only
have
occurred
but
might
likely
occur.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
if
it
was
totally
demonstrable
that
the
grand
jury
was
acting
in
an
oppressive
manner,
it
would
fall
even
under
the
massachusetts
rule,
but
i’d
like
to
point
in
that
case
that
it
wasn’t
demonstrable
until
the
grand
jury,
as
soon
as
they
got
the
doctor’s
name
dismissed.
it
was
dismissed.
it
wasn’t
until
it
was
all
over
and
until
then,
from
the
surface
it
apparently
looked
as
if
they
were
investigating
narcotic.
but
the
first
question
was
who
told
you
that?
and
as
soon
as
the
name
came
forward,
that
was
the
end
of
the
grand
jury.
how
you
would
ever
demonstrate
that
in
advance,
i
don’t
know
mr.
justice.
if
i
could
save
the
few
minutes
for
rebuttal
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
have
only
two
brief
to
points
your
honor.
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stewart,
my
brother
over
here
indicated
that
this
was
an
incidence
of
mr.
pappas
silencing
himself
as
the
price
of
the
story.
there’s
nothing
improper
on
that.
there
was
a
case
a
few
years
ago
where
a
camera
crew
went
into
a
massachusetts
mental
hospital
and
agreed
in
advance
to
keep
in
confidence
not
to
publish
the
actual
faces,
names
of
people
in
their
to
preserve
that
confidence.
you
can
imagine
a
labor
leader,
who
is
ill
at
home
and
the
press
is
clamoring
for
an
interview
and
he
might
say,
“come
in,
you
can
set-up
your
cameras,
have
an
interview,
but
not
in
relation
to
my
family.
that’s
anything
you
see
or
here
there
is
in
confidence.
they
are
not
part
of
the
story.”
this
kind
of
thing,
where
you
impose
a
confidence
in
regard
to
one
thing
in
order
to
get
at
the
larger
story
is
very
common
and
part
of
getting
and
disseminating
news.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
but
it
was
only
about
half
instance
that
the
raid
didn’t
come
that
night.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
and
if
there
had
been
a
raid
that
night,
could
we
possibly
say
that
the
constitutional
issue
turns
on
the
fact
that
the
raid
was
there
and
he
covered
it
and
published
it
whereas
--
because
the
police,
perhaps
even
knew
he
was
there,
i
don’t
know,
didn’t
raid
that
night.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
right.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no
questions
about
that.
the
only
other
thing
i
want
to
say
is
that
i
submit
to
you
that
it’s
more
important
than
an
occasional
indictment
that
an
earl
caldwell
be
allowed
to
do
in-depth
stories
on
the
black
panthers.
mr.
branzburg
be
allowed
to
show
that
hashish
is
available,
readily
available
to
kids
in
two
counties
in
kentucky.
that
mr.
pappas
be
allowed
to
report
a
police
raid
from
the
inside.
we
know
these
stories
would
never
get
to
the
public
if
it
were
not
for
the
confidentiality
and
for
the
fact,
the
people
who
gave
them
permission
thought
that
they
were
entitled
to
impose
a
privilege.
the
justice
concurring
in
the
knops
case
said
it
better
than
i
could.
i
know
of
no
period
in
history
where
any
freedoms
have
flourished
in
the
face
of
the
states
curtailment
of
the
free
flow
of
information,
that’
s
what
we’re
fighting
for
here.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes.
i
think
there
a
number
of
factors,
your
honor.
in
the
first
place,
i
think
there
has
been
much
agreement
between
prosecutors
and
newsmen
over
the
years
in
the
past.
i
think
that
in
addition
to
that
that
there
has
been
a
flood
of
subpoenas
more
recently
as
we
get
into
the
problem
of
minorities
and
radical
groups.
we
have
our
reporters
today,
doing
things
they
never
did
before.
reporters
themselves,
i
used
to
be
one.
i
would
tell
you
that
our
reporters
today
are
much
more
investigative,
more
sophisticated,
more
daring.
here’s
pappas,
he
put
his
life
on
the
line
by
being
inside
the
headquarters
in
order
to
report
from
the
inside.
this,
i
think
is
of
relatively
recent
origin
when
combined
also
with
the
concept
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutor
that
here
is
a
man
who
is
on
the
scene
and
who
could
provide
an
available
investigative
arm
of
the
government.
all
these
things
have
come
to
the
front
at
a
time,
at
a
sudden
time
just
in
the
way
that
perhaps
in
griswold,
the
question
which
you
think
would
go
back
for
100
years
did
not
arise
until
that
particular
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
combination,
that’s
correct.
and
as
my
brother
suggested
a
few
minutes
ago,
here
in
the
course
of
a
year
and
a
half,
nbc,
cbs,
we’re
getting
four
subpoenas
a
month
recently.
they
didn’t
get
those
counter
subpoenas
back
in
the
old
days,
123
subpoenas
between
january
of
1969
and
july
of
1970.
and
if
this
court
affirms
this
case,
i
can
assure
you
that
reporters
will
be
spending
a
lot
more
time
in
grand
juries
and
in
courtrooms
than
they
are
in
reporting
from
now
on.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
my
test
would
mean
only
your
honor
that
the
court
might,
in
that
instance,
have
little
difficulty
in
indicating
particularly
if
the
ammunition
had
been
used,
had
been
part
of
some
greater
difficulty.
might
have
in
balancing
the
interest,
might
well
find
in
that
case
that
the
interest
of
the
prosecutor
and
of
the
grand
jury,
if
you
will,
overrode
the
first
amendment.
but
the
privilege
would
come
into
effect,
yes,
because
he
was
there
and
saw
it
under
a
confidential
umbrella.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
certainly.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
it
wasn’t,
it’s
a
commonwealth
[voice
overlap].
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
i
think
if
i
may
suggest
it,
it’s
a
very
fortunate
one,
because
the
confidence
was
deemed
to
have
such
order
in
that
case
that
they
actually
enforced
it.
in
other
words,
if
i’m
using
the
case
as
an
illustration
that
a
confidence,
would
rather
than
being
improper
in
a
way
to
silence
the
reporter,
it
was
in
that
case,
a
way
of
getting
the
larger
story.
and
if
they
had
abide
it
by
their
agreement
that
they
had
entered
into
and
had
taken
films
which
did
not
show
inmates
without
their
permission
then
that
would
have
been
an
instance
of
a
story
of
great
benefit
to
the
public
where
they
nevertheless
could
have
gotten
it
only
by
agreeing
to
a
confidentiality.
now,
it
so
it
happen
that
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no
question
about
it.
that’s
right.
but
i
think
the
fact
that
he
attempted
to
break
it
and
in
the
court
saw
it
of
such
a
high
order
just
to
enforce
it
by
injunction.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
quite
true
and
you're
going
to
have
instances
of
clashes
in
these
cases
occasionally
between
with
sixth
amendment
right
to
call
it
an
assist,
first
amendment
right
of
the
reporter.
this
is
nothing
new.
these
kinds
of
clashes
and
balances
are
quite
common
in
constitutional
adjudication.
the
kind
that
the
courts
face
constantly
and
the
courts
are
facing
them
right
now
below
and
finally,
i
might
say,
decided
them
in
our
favor.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
paul
pappas.
this
is
the
third
case
in
the
trilogy
now,
before
the
court
involving
the
first
amendment,
a
newsman.
the
facts
in
the
case
are
relatively
simple.
mr.
pappas
is
an
experienced,
professional
newsman-photographer
for
wtev-tv
and
with
its
principal
offices
in
new
bedford,
massachusetts.
the
station
covers
all
of
rhode
island,
part
of
massachusetts,
part
of
connecticut.
on
july
30,
1970,
he
was
in
providence,
rhode
island,
when
he
received
a
call
from
his
station,
telling
him
to
go
to
new
bedford.
they
seemed
to
be
burning
down
new
bedford,
was
the
message
that
he
got,
they
were
not
identified.
he
went
to
new
bedford,
to
the
west
end
of
the
town
where
apparently
that’s
his
orders
had
been
described
for
him
and
he
there
ran
into
a
barricade.
he
therefore
returned
to
the
new
bedford
office,
after
which
he
received
another
call,
from
his
superiors
telling
him
that
he
went
back
to
the
area,
he
would
be
allowed
into
the
area
through
the
barricade.
he
returned
and
he
set
up
his
cameras
outside
a
boarded-up
variety
store,
which
apparently
was
being
used
as
headquarters
for
the
black
panthers.
he
set
up
his
camera
and
a
spokesman
for
the
panthers
came
out
of
the
store
with
about
a
dozen
blacks.
they
gathered
and
the
spokesman
gave
a
press
interview.
there
were
approximately
five
newsmen
present,
including
mr.
pappas.
all
of
the
films
which
mr.
pappas
took
of
the
news
conference
were
subsequently
given
to
and
viewed
by
the
district
attorney.
the
next
sequence
of
facts
which
actually
gave
rise
to
this
case
were
prompted
by
two
occurrences.
first,
during
the
news
conference,
the
spokesman
said
that
the
police
would
be
allowed
into
the
store
if
they
had
search
warrants,
if
they
conducted
themselves
in
a
gentlemanly
manner
and
if
they
were
accompanied
by
the
news
media.
the
second
occurrence
was
that
at
a
kind
of
side
conference
after
the
spokesman
has
gotten
through
with
this
more
formal
press
conference,
the
panthers
complained
to
mr.
pappas
that
the
news
media
always
covered
the
side
of
the
police
in
circumstances
such
as
these.
and
on
this
point,
mr.
pappas
said,
“well,
that’s
because
the
media
are
never
allowed
to
show
any
other
side.”
now
it
was
as
a
result
of
these
two
occurrences
that
the
panthers
then
agreed
with
mr.
pappas
that
he
would
be
allowed
into
their
headquarters
that
evening,
to
spend
the
night
if
he
wished,
if
he
came
back
personally,
but
there
was
a
condition.
if
there
was
a
raid,
they
said,
he
would
be
allowed
to
report
and
photograph
anything
that
took
place.
on
the
other
hand,
if
there
was
no
raid,
there
was
no
raid,
any
as
he
put
it
anything
i
saw
or
heard
would
be
strictly
in
confidence.
later
that
night,
after
he
had
been
accompanied
back
to
and
into
the
headquarters,
these
conditions
were
reimposed.
they
were
specifically
stated
again
and
he
again
agreed
to
them.
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
was
adverse
comment
about
whether
he
might
not
be
a
police
stoolie
and
he
assured
them
no,
he
was
there
as
a
representative
of
the
press.
he
understands
he
was
that
if
there
was
a
police
raid,
he
was
free
to
cover
it.
if
there
was
no
police
raid,
he
would
keep
whatever
he
saw
or
heard
in
confidence.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
think
the
privilege
would
come
into
play.
i
think
that
in
the
subsequent
hearing,
on
whether
they
were
overriding
public
interest
in
the
production
of
his
testimony,
it
might
well
sway
the
court
that
he
saw
during
the
period
of
confidentiality
and
privilege
and
of
that
which
was
so
vital
to
the
public
interest
that
he
should
be
required
to
testify,
anyway.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
this
is
precisely,
your
honor,
why
we
suggest
to
you
that
there
must
be
a
balancing
test
and
this
is
one
of
the
factors
that
undoubtedly
a
judge
would
take
into
consideration
in
determining
where
the
balance
lies
in
this
particular
case.
how
serious
was
the
event
that
he
saw?
was
there
any
other
source
for
getting
the
information?
what
was
the
public
interest
in
it?
did
he
in
fact
have
the
relevant
information,
and
so
forth.
these
are
the
very
factors
that
a
court
would
consider
in
determining
whether
he
should
be
made
to
testify.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
precisely.
so
long
as
he
was
there
and
this
occurred
during
the
period
when
the
privilege
was
in
effect.
now,
the
period
here,
we
must
remember
went
into
effect
when
he
went
into
the
headquarters,
not
beforehand.
and
up
until
the
time
that
there
was
a
police
raid,
when
all
restrictions
were
on.
if
anything
occurred
inside
there,
then
that
was
privileged
but
the
court
might
well
find,
in
a
given
circumstance,
that
the
public
interest
overrode
the
privilege,
as
it
does
any
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
the
relationship
of
confidentiality
that
can
come
into
effect
for
any
number
of
reasons.
i
can
only
say
here
that
while
he
apparently,
so
far
as
the
records
shows,
did
not
have
a
long
acquaintanceship
with
the
people.
there
obviously
was
something
about
his
demeanor
and
his
seriousness
at
the
time
of
the
press
conference
which
made
them
believe
that
they
could
trust
this
man.
they
did
not
give
the
same
privilege
to
the
other
five
newsmen
who
were
present.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
general
rule
that
i
would
lay
down,
mr.
justice
white
is
that
there
is
a
privilege
and
that
there
is
a
presumption
that
the
newsman
is
protected
and
then
and
only
then
can
the
government
come
in
with
its
burden
and
attempt
to
carry
it
by
showing
the
various
of
elements
that
we
have
outlined
in
our
brief.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
let
me
emphasize.
first
of
all,
that
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
in
this
record
of
any
crime
occurring
during
these
three
hours.
i
want
to
make
that
clear,
because
this
is
not
a
criminal
case.
secondly,
assuming
that
there
was
a
crime
then
i
would
say
that
they
have
to
show
that
the
grand
jury
is
investigating
a
specific
crime.
i
would
say
they
would
show
that
he
had
at
least
probable
cause
to
believe
that
he
had
information
relating
to
that
crime.
number
three,
that
there
was
no
other
available
source
for
receiving,
obtaining
the
same
information.
and
finally,
that
there
was,
as
this
court
put
it
in
gibson,
an
overriding
interest
on
the
part
of
the
public
in
obtaining
that
information.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no
sir.
in
my
view,
it
would
not.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
do.
i
confess
that
a
rule
could
be
fashion
that
wouldn’t.
in
my
own
view,
i
think
for
example
to
take
the
branzburg
case
that
it’s
more
vital
that
the
public
know
that
a
youngster
can
get
a
drink
in
that
community,
far
harder
that
he
can
get
pot.
he
can
get
pot
virtually
by
asking
for
it
and
then,
he
can’t
get
a
drink.
i
think
it’s
more
important
that
the
public
know
that
and
that
those
boys
be
prosecuted.
on
the
other
hand,
i
can
well
see
that
in
a
murder
case,
in
a
desperate
crime
situation,
that
the
interest
might
apply
other
way.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
there’s
the
same
degree
of
predictability
as
there
is
in
a
prior
restraint
case.
there
--
in
a
prior
restraint
case
you
do
have
your
exceptions,
but
the
fact
is,
that
a
99%
of
the
cases,
there
can
be
no
prior
restraint
and
here
i
would
say
that
the
predictability
comes
because
a
99%
of
the
case,
the
privilege
stands
and
the
prosecutors
know
that
and
they’re
not
going
to
issue
the
subpoenas
unless
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
it
has
even
without
privilege
in
many
instances
before,
as
was
pointed
out
this
morning.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
am
afraid
your
honor
that
if
the
privilege
was
stricken
we
would
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
we
would
[laughter
attempt]
if
it
was
not
allowed,
[laughter]
we
would
have
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
we
would
have
a
more
serious
situation.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
your
honor,
if
you
will
look
at
the
caldwell
subpoena
you
will
see
specific
crimes
set
out
that
the
grand
jury
were
investigating.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
would
turn
to
our
single
appendix,
on
the
first
page,
you
will
see
that
the
subpoena
orders
mr.
pappas
to
appear
and
there
to
give
such
evidence
as
he
knows,
relating
to
any
matters,
which
may
be
inquired
of
or
on
behalf
of
the
commonwealth
before
said
grand
jury.
now,
the
masters
of
supreme
judicial
court
has
said
that
mr.
pappas
carries
a
burden
to
show
that
the
grand
jury
inquiry
is
improper
or
oppressive.
i
would
like
anyone
to
tell
me
how
we
can
show
that
this
is
an
improper
or
oppressive
grand
jury
inquiry
when
we
don’t
even
know
what
in
the
world
they’re
investigating.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
my
answer
is
that
while
it’s
quite
true
that
in
many
instances
the
grand
jury
will
go
from
one
crime
to
another
or
will
go
from
suspicion
to
fact
that
where
you
have
first
amendment
privilege
involved,
the
heavy
duty
involved
in
the
prosecution
in
trammeling
on
that
privilege
that
there,
there
is
a
duty
to
indicate
that
kind
of
situation
that
they’re
inquiring
into.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
you
don’t
do
that,
you’re
not
even
sure
whether
the
privilege
covers
the
precise
situation
that
you're
looking
into.
for
example,
if
i
might
just
--
if
it
turns
out
that
what
they
are
really
investigating
here
was
something
that
happened
on
june
8,
when
these
disorders
apparently
were
going
on
as
opposed
to
july
30,
that
would
be
an
entirely
situation
and
if
they
were
looking
into
something
which
they
think
happened
during
the
three
hours
that
he
present
in
the
headquarters.
i
think,
there’s
a
duty
and
a
burden
upon
them
to
come
forward
with
an
indication
of
what
it
is
that
they’re
investigating.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
if
they
cited
a
statute
that
they
said
was
violated
and
gave
a
period
of
time
and
a
place
when
it
was
suppose
to
have
occurred,
i
would
say
yes,
it
would
meet
my
definition.
i
would
like
to
point
out
here,
just
by
way
of
example
that
the
massachusetts
supreme
court
took
judicial
notice
of
the
fact,
there
was
gun
fire,
but
they
never
said
when,
where,
by
whom,
and
certainly
didn’t
say
that
it
had
taken
place
during
the
three
hours
he
was
there.
this
is
a
kind
of
danger
i
don’t
think
you
run
into
if
you
don’t
have
some
specificity
in
regard
to
subpoenaing
newsman
before
a
grand
jury.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
it’s
my
understanding
that
while
sometimes
they
are
more
specific
that
this
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
this
is
in
--
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
on
a
form,
your
honor,
because
it
has
a
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
it
has
--
as
you’ll
see
it
has
a
blank
space
said,
blank
or
the
grand
jury
and
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
your
honor,
it
was
not
argued
below
in
this
case,
that
the
man
did
not
have
to
appear
before
the
grand
jury.
i
would
point
to
you
however,
that
if
there
was
ever
a
case,
where
his
appearance
would
be
a
useless
act,
it
would
be
this
one,
for
this
reason.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
but,
that
would
not
have
been
received
in
confidence
mr.
justice.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no
sir,
i
quite
disagree,
he
would
go.
and
he
would
be
required
to
give
testimony
like
anyone
else.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
no
i
was
raising
the
generality
of
the
subpoena
only
in
relation
to
the
specific
confidentiality
that
has
been
imposed
upon
him.
what
i
say
is
that
in
view
of
the
fact
that
once
the
confidentiality
is
imposed,
you
therefore
run
right
smack
into
your
first
amendment
problem,
that
the
ordinary
duty
of
the
commonwealth
to
simply
order
a
--
to
issue
a
general
subpoena,
must
go
by
the
boards,
because
then,
since
your
entrenching
on
first
amendment
rights,
they
have
got
to
be
more
specific
and
carry
more
of
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
because,
the
judge
is
going
to
have
to
make
a
decision
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
balancing
the
various
interest
as
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
because,
your
honor,
he
is
obtaining
information
for
the
public
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
think
you
have
to
give
him
a
hearing,
because
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
merely
because
he
is
part
of
the
press,
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
who
has
received
information
in
order
to
get
a
dissemination
of
information
to
the
public
and
without
this
kind
of
showing.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
he
is
asserts
it
in
the
same
way
that
a
grand
jury
doesn’t
know
that
a
fellow
is
going
to
play
the
bet
until
he
plays
it
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
your
honor,
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly,
what
he
saw
was
not
protected
by
the
privilege,
because
he
did
not
receive
it
in
his
direction.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
and
he
stands
in
the
shoes
of
any
other
man.
the
problem
arises
only,
when
as
a
newsman
in
an
attempt
to
gather,
edit,
analyze,
write
and
disseminate
information
to
the
public
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
yes.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
the
fact
remains
your
honor
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
he
does
your
honor,
and
i
can
only
reiterate
that
the
privilege
comes
into
effect
when
he
is
obtaining
information
in
confidentiality
from
sources
which
busted
the
confidentiality,
he
would
never
receive
his
story
and
the
public
would
never
receive
the
story.
let
us
take
this
particular
case
for
example,
let’s
assume
there
had
been
a
police
raid
this
night.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
police
raid
would
never
have
been
covered
from
the
inside,
except
for
this
agreement
of
confidentiality.
the
public
would
never
have
received
the
story
about
that
police
raid
from
anybody’s
viewpoint
other
than
the
police.
now,
it
so
happens
that
the
panthers
wanted
their
side,
at
least
told
for
once
not
in
a
prejudice
sense,
but
to
have
somebody
not
just
take
the
word
for
the
police
as
to
what
had
happened.
and
they
noticed
they
paid
no
restriction
upon
him
in
regard
to
his
reporting
of
the
police
raid.
you
are
free
to
report
it
anywhere
you
want
to,
to
photograph
anything
you
want
to.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i
can
only
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
sir.
unless
he
received
the
information
in
confidence
and
were
in
the
instance
that
you
posed
you
did
not
say
that
an
element
of
confidence
was
imposed
upon.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
alright,
now
there
is
a
lot
of
information,
your
honor,
which
in
this
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
can
i
draw
this
distinction
for
you?
a
reporter
goes
to
a
public
press
conference
by
the
president
of
the
united
states.
he
is
there
like
any
other
reporter,
no
confidence
applies
--
confidentiality
applies.
he,
like
a
reporter,
he’s
like
everybody
else,
except
that
he
is
reporting,
the
story
goes
out.
the
next
day,
the
president
calls
the
reporter
in
and
he
says,
“i
would
like
this
off
the
record,
but
i’m
not
sure
that
you
fully
understood
the
point
that
i
was
trying
to
make
and
i
want
to
give
you
an
in
depth
look,
so
that
in
your
future
reporting,
even
though
you
do
not
report
what
i
said
that
you
will
understand
and
have
a
depth
of
knowledge
about
this
that
will
make
your
reporting
to
the
public
more
meaningful”
and
he
therefore
gives
him
a
story.
now,
i
say,
without
relevance
to
the
presidency,
i
say
that
the
confidentiality
having
been
imposed
that
the
only
way
a
grand
jury
is
going
to
get
out
of
him
what
the
president
had
told
him
is
if
it
showed
an
overriding
public
need
for
that
information,
because
the
element
of
confidentiality
that
establish
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i
am
sorry
if
i
haven’t
satisfied
you,
i
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that’s
right.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
only
if
he
has
information,
which
he
received
in
confidence,
perhaps
we
can
--
perhaps
i
can
satisfy
you
by
analogizing
with
the
fifth
amendment.
you
and
i
both
go
before
the
grand
jury,
but
it
so
happens
i
am
implicated
in
the
crime.
now,
we
are
both
are
obligated
to
testify,
in
the
sense
that
we
both
saw
the
same
thing.
but,
the
fact
is
that
as
soon
as
i
plead
my
fifth
amendment
right,
i
can
then
have
a
court
determine
whether
i
am
properly
pleading
it.
when
i
come
out
of
your
category,
and
i
am
separate
from
you.
i
am
distinct,
because
the
constitution
coverage
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
can
i
put
the
appearance
before
the
grand
jury
to
one
side,
because
the
problem
is
that
i
--
we
did
not
argue
this
below.
and
while
i
do
want
to
say
that
since
the
only
information
that
the
grand
jury
is
apparently
seeking
is
the
information
that
he
acquire
during
the
three
hours
of
confidentiality.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
oh!
yes.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
absolutely.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
am
sorry,
i
didn’t
make
that
clear.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that’s
correct.
i
think
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that’s
correct.
i
do
think
i’d
be
misleading
you
if
i
didn’t
make
two
points
about
it
though,
number
one,
is
that
it
would
be
a
total
useless
act
for
him
to
appear
and
i
am
not
in
favor
of
putting
the
man
at
the
grand
jury
room
for
a
totally
useless
act.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
he
did
appear
once,
correct.
the
other
point
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
correct.
the
other
point
is
that
in
view
of
what
the
caldwell
court
said
about
the
black
panthers
that
would
be
equally
applicable
here,
that
is
if
he
disappeared
again
in
to
the
grand
jury.
well,
it
might
be
that
a
number
of
things
could
happen,
including
his
personal
safety,
as
he
testifies.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
he’d
do
it
once.
absolutely.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
your
honor,
when
we
get
away
from
the
grand
jury,
there
may
be
other
considerations
applicable
and
i
am
not
attempting
the
day
to
set
down
a
set
of
criteria
for
trial
[voice
overlap]
legislature--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
but
--
yes,
that’s
absolutely
right.
what
happens,
as
we
see
it
is
this,
that
when
he’s
called
before
the
grand
jury
and
the
questions
begin
about
--
well,
as
in
this
case,
what
did
you
see
and
hear
during
your
three
hours
in
the
headquarter?
did
you
see
ammunitions?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
alright,
let’s
take
the
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
recognizing
that
there
may
be
some
distinctions
between
a
legislature
and
so
forth
or
you
now
posed
to
the
grand
jury.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
alright,
the
privilege
applies
and
then
what
happens
is
he
refuses
to
answer
the
question
and
he
goes
before
the
judge.
if
the
prosecutor
persist,
my
feeling
is,
the
prosecutor
wouldn’t
have
called
him
in
the
first
place
or
won’t
persist
if
the
court
rules
the
right
way.
but,
in
any
event,
he
goes
before
the
judge
and
the
judge
says,
as
he
did
in
this
case,
pappas
was
asked
questions
and
he
told
the
circumstance
under
which
the
press
conference,
he
told
the
circumstances
of
his
specific
agreement,
how
he
went
in,
how
he
was
made
the
promise
again,
and
how
he
came
out.
then,
the
judge
having
satisfied
himself
that
in
fact
a
confidentiality
was
imposed
upon
him,
that
he
is
in
fact
a
newsman
during
the
course
of
his
employment
then
i
would
say
that
the
judge
then
turns
to
the
government
or
the
state
and
says,
“alright,
if
you
persist,
you
now
have
the
burden,
because
of
the
first
amendment
situation,
you
now
have
the
burden
to
prove
various
factors.”
what
are
you
investigating?
what
do
you
think
he
knows
about
it?
and,
have
you
gone
every
else
to
tie
to
get
the
same
information.
what
is
really
the
overriding
need
for
this
information
in
this
case?
now,
this
is
not
unique
your
honor,
because
this
is
going
on
right
now,
down
in
the
lower
courts,
its
happening,
we
have
cases
in
our
brief,
dorn
and
rios
and
a
lot
of
others
where
courts
are
doing
this
exact
thing.
the
fellow
who
refused
to
answer
the
question,
the
court
will
take
him
in
and
he’ll
say,
“i
find
under
this
circumstances
that
you're
interest
is
not
sufficient
in
view
of
the
first
amendment
privilege
and
therefore,
the
subpoena
is
quashed.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no
sir,
that
was
--
the
washington
post
did
that
and
the
new
york
times
issued
a
set
of
instructions
by
which
they
use
a
great
deal
of
care
in
discretion
as
to
the
extent
that
they
will
accept
backgrounders.
but
this
is
not
true
of
newspapers
in
general
and
even
with
the
new
york
times,
it’s
not
completely
true.
i
think
you’ll
find
that
confidences
at
every
level
and
particularly
the
governmental
level,
and
particularly
in
regard
to
minority
and
radical
groups
today,
as
professor
blasi’s
report
well
demonstrate
that
the
confidentiality
plays
an
absolutely
vital
role
in
the
gathering
and
dissemination
of
information,
absolutely
essential.
and
mr.
justice
marshall,
you
indicated
that
the
ordinary
man
would
have
to
appear
in
circumstances
as
we’ve
outlined.
the
american
law
institute
model
code
of
evidence
allows
the
following
people
not
to
appear.
there
is
of
course
self-incrimination.
the
attorney,
the
priest,
the
physician,
the
spouse,
religious
beliefs
can’t
be
in
part
in
political
votes,
trade
secrets,
state
secrets,
official
information,
communication
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
your
honor,
i
thought
i
put
that
to
rest,
in
the
sense
that
while
i
do
believe
that
mr.
pappas
should
not
be
made
to
appear.
i
have
to
concede
that
it
was
not
argued
below,
you
understand
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no.
the
argument
has
been
made
by
massachusetts
and
perhaps
suggested
by
the
justice
that
the
ordinary
person
has
to
turn
up
and
testify
and
that
we’re
carving
out
of
that,
out
of
this
inviolate
right
of
the
grand
jury,
some
special
case
were
newsmen
and
all
i’m
showing
it
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
correct,
that’s
absolutely
correct.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
some
are
common
laws,
some
by
statute?
that’s
correct.
in
massachusetts
there
was
a
list,
which
i
won’t
read,
but
which
is
quite
similar
to
the
one
i’ve
just
read.
for
example
like,
physician
doesn’t
have
a
privilege,
but
a
psychotherapist
does.
i
mean,
there
are
all
kinds
of
exceptions
that
people
have
right
now.
so
the
only
point
i’m
making
on
this
that,
is
that
it
isn’t
as
if
we
are
saying
the
newsman
is
the
only
one
out
of
the
population
who
doesn’t
have
to
turn
up
to
testify.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i’m
sorry,
i
didn’t
hear
you.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i
think
it
depends
upon
his
relationship
with
the
party
who
was
injured.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
i
would
certainly
assume.
that
is
correct.
and,
that
is
the
point
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
[laughter]
but
mr.
justice
the
distinction
between
the
physician
is
precisely
the
one
i
was
trying
to
make
a
few
minutes
ago.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
wonder
if
i
can
get
to
the
point
of
mr.
justice
stewart
made
in
the
branzburg
case
about
speech
versus
the
press.
mr.
justice,
i
think
if
these
were
essentially
the
same
interests.
if
they
were
equally
protected,
there
would
be
no
need
for
any
reference
in
the
press,
in
the
constitution
to
the
press
as
such.
the
press
privilege
would
be
covered
by
the
speech
privilege.
i
think
that
the
speech
privilege
is
not
as
broad
as
the
functioning
process
by
which
the
press
operates.
to
put
it
in
another
way
that
the
press
right
is
more
than
a
right
to
speak.
the
mere
right
to
speak
without
being
able
to
obtain
information,
for
example
would
be
a
meaningless
one.
speech
normally
involves
an
individual
or
a
group
attempting
to
express
their
individual
view.
the
press
covers
the
entire
spectrum
of
dissemination
not
only
the
views
of
news,
people,
and
individuals,
but
the
gathering
and
analyzing
and
publishing
over
the
whole
wrap
of
news
that
gets
before
the
public.
i
think
that
our
founding
fathers
recognized
that
it’s
one
thing
just
to
speak
out
but
that
is
also
vitally
important
to
get
the
widest
possible
range
of
information
before
the
public.
and
the
way
to
do
it
is
through
a
free
and
untrammeled
press.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
there
are
situations
where
they
will
not
be
equally
protected.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
perhaps
that’s
a
better
way
of
putting
it,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i
think
television
is
equally
covered
with
--
certainly
encompassed
within
the
press
function.
the
court
has
recognized
that
radio
is.
the
lower
courts
have
recognized
the
television
is.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
anything,
there
should
be
more
of
a
right
rather
than
the
last
one
because
the
figure
shows
that
as
compared
with
the
largest
daily
newspaper’s
circulation
is
some
2
million.
cbs
daily
news,
in
the
evening
has
9
million
viewers
so
that
the
impact
is
far
greater
on
news
dissemination
in
the
television
than
even
the
press.
i
think
it’s
clearly
covered
within
the
privilege.
i
would
like
to
get
back,
if
i
might
to
the
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
your
honor,
the
point
i
made
a
little
while
ago
was
that
when
we
get
the
trials
and
we
recognize
that
all
three
of
these
cases
are
grand
juries,
we
have
the
element
of
secrecy;
we
have
the
element
of
merely
trying
to
determine
whether
there
--
whether
someone
should
be
indicted
and
so
forth.
there
might
be
slightly
different
considerations
that
the
trial
effect
takes
into
consideration
in
balancing
in
a
trial.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
but
the
privilege
would
applied,
would
come
into
effect
and
the
only
way
the
difference
would
be
is
to
trial
compared
with
grand
jury
would
be
as
to
whether
it
might
be
more
important
in
a
particular
trial
to
have
his
testimonies
in
the
grand
jury.
otherwise,
i
think
probably
the
same
applies.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
in
terms
of
his
appearance
before
the
grand
jury,
that’s
correct.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
absolutely,
yes.
you
recognized
that
even
under
the
district
court
order
in
caldwell,
this
case
has
to
be
reversed.
the
state
did
not
put
on
a
single
witness.
it
gave
no
testimony.
it
offered
nothing
of
any
way
at
the
hearing.
the
only
witness
was
mr.
pappas,
who
established
the
confidence.
the
state
not
only
carried
no
burden,
but
massachusetts
said
it
did
not
have
to.
that
there
was
no
right
to
be
recognized
and
consequently,
the
state
carry
no
burden
and
it
said
that
if
we
want
to
prove
that
the
grand
jury
was
oppressive
in
some
fashion
we
would
have
to
do
that.
but
again,
since
we
are
totally
at
a
lost
to
know
what
it
is
that
they
want
and
why,
it’s
impossible
for
us,
obviously
at
this
stage
to
prove
that
this
grand
jury
inquiry
is
oppressive.
there’s
not
a
word,
not
a
word
or
testimony
or
evidence
from
the
state
to
prove
anything
here.
all
we
have
is
a
simple
subpoena
in
the
general
language
that
i’ve
indicated
to
you.
and
in
this
regard
i’d
like
to
relate
--
just
a
moment
to
relate
an
incident
in
the
guest
and
stanzler
argument,
because
to
me
it
drives
on
the
importance
of
what
we’re
talking
to
here.
eugene
patterson
of
the
atlanta
constitution
told
of
an
instance
where
his
paper
did
an
exposé
on
narcotics
in
the
georgia
state
prison
system.
they
got
the
information
from
a
doctor
who
had
worked
there
and
who
insisted
for
obvious
reasons
that
his
information
be
kept
confidential.
the
paper
published
the
exposé
and
immediately
a
grand
jury
was
called.
the
grand
jury
wasn’t
investigating
the
narcotics
in
the
georgia
prison
system.
the
grand
jury
want
to
know
the
doctor’s
name
and
the
publisher
refused
to
produce
the
doctor’s
name.
and
at
the
last
minute,
so
as
to
keep
him
from
going
to
jail,
the
doctor
revealed
his
own
name
and
the
grand
jury
was
dismissed.
now,
that
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
we
face
here
if
you
allow
grand
juries
without
any
sanctions
at
all,
any
control,
any
burden
on
the
government,
simply
to
subpoena
someone
at
will
who
has
received
confidential
information
as
part
of
the
press,
part
of
its
duty
to
disseminate
news
to
the
public.
i’m
not
for
a
moment
condemning
grand
juries
in
general
or
prosecutors
in
general.
all
i’m
saying
is
there
are
too
many
instances
of
abuse
in
the
past
and
potential
abuse
for
the
future
where
a
newsman
can
be
called
as
retaliation
for
a
particular
story,
as
a
warning
not
to
go
to
the
black
panther
headquarters
next
time,
for
political
reasons
or
for
anything
else.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
think
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
in
the
first
place,
i
think
that
the
ability
to
waive
is
on
the
newsman,
so
that
if
he
chose
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
alright,
if
he
chooses
not
to,
i
think
the
privilege
extends
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
your
honor
that’s
a
large
assumption
and
i
am
not
sure
you
can
make
that.
the
point
is
that
having
received
something
in
confident
and
then
having
an
effect
broken
the
confidence
later,
i
think
that
that
newsman’s
effectiveness
could
well
be
[voice
overlap].
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
absolutely,
and
his
whole
ability
to
gather
news
from
whatever
group.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
think
that
the
court
can
establish
a
rule
that
when
a
reporter,
part
of
the
press
protected
by
the
constitution
receives
during
the
course
of
his
news
gathering
duties,
information
in
confidence
that
that
brings
the
first
amendment
into
play
and
he
is
protected
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
but
your
honor,
i
think
in
a
whole
serious
of
cases
the
court
has
done
precisely
that.
i
think
in
lamont,
bantam
books,
bates,
dombrowski,
talley
what
the
court
has
done
is
not
to
say
that
in
this
particular
instance,
there
has
been
a
suppression
of
a
first
amendment
right.
i
think
what
the
court
has
done
in
those
cases
is
to
say
that
if
you
are
going
to
engage
in
the
type
of
governmental
interference
involved
in
those
cases,
it
is
gong
to
have
a
future
chilling
effect.
and
therefore,
i
think
it
is
incumbent
upon
the
court
to
look
about,
look
not
only
to
the
instant
case
but
to
look
at
the
kind
of
abuse
that
could
be
inherent
in
a
refusal
to
recognize
the
privilege.
i
think
certainly,
it
can
look
to
what
is
likely
to
happen
if
you
do
not
establish
the
privilege
here.
you
got
to
remember,
we’re
not
trying
to
set
a
set
rule
here
which
a
newsman
can
for
all
time
and
under
any
circumstances
simply
assert
privilege
and
go
home.
if
he
asserts
it
without
warrant,
if
he
asserts
it
then
the
situation
he
is
not
entitled
to,
that
can
be
determined
by
court
and
that’s
the
kind
of
adjudication
that’s
constantly
going
on
in
all
kinds
of
cases.
but,
yes
i
do
think
that
in
determining
chilling
effect
affect
for
their
future
that
the
court
can
look
at
what
might
well
go
on.
in
the
case,
for
example,
where
the
statute
recall
--
attempted
to
make
a
pamphleteers
name
and
address
appear
on
the
pamphlet,
the
court
didn’t
say
that
in
that
particular
instance,
it
would
hurt
the
individual.
it
said
that
that
would
detour
people
in
the
future
from
engaging
in
this
kind
of
first
amendment
exercise
of
rights.
yes,
i
do
think,
absolutely
that
you
can
look
at
the
kinds
of
abuses
that
not
only
have
occurred
but
might
likely
occur.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
if
it
was
totally
demonstrable
that
the
grand
jury
was
acting
in
an
oppressive
manner,
it
would
fall
even
under
the
massachusetts
rule,
but
i’d
like
to
point
in
that
case
that
it
wasn’t
demonstrable
until
the
grand
jury,
as
soon
as
they
got
the
doctor’s
name
dismissed.
it
was
dismissed.
it
wasn’t
until
it
was
all
over
and
until
then,
from
the
surface
it
apparently
looked
as
if
they
were
investigating
narcotic.
but
the
first
question
was
who
told
you
that?
and
as
soon
as
the
name
came
forward,
that
was
the
end
of
the
grand
jury.
how
you
would
ever
demonstrate
that
in
advance,
i
don’t
know
mr.
justice.
if
i
could
save
the
few
minutes
for
rebuttal
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
have
only
two
brief
to
points
your
honor.
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stewart,
my
brother
over
here
indicated
that
this
was
an
incidence
of
mr.
pappas
silencing
himself
as
the
price
of
the
story.
there’s
nothing
improper
on
that.
there
was
a
case
a
few
years
ago
where
a
camera
crew
went
into
a
massachusetts
mental
hospital
and
agreed
in
advance
to
keep
in
confidence
not
to
publish
the
actual
faces,
names
of
people
in
their
to
preserve
that
confidence.
you
can
imagine
a
labor
leader,
who
is
ill
at
home
and
the
press
is
clamoring
for
an
interview
and
he
might
say,
“come
in,
you
can
set-up
your
cameras,
have
an
interview,
but
not
in
relation
to
my
family.
that’s
anything
you
see
or
here
there
is
in
confidence.
they
are
not
part
of
the
story.”
this
kind
of
thing,
where
you
impose
a
confidence
in
regard
to
one
thing
in
order
to
get
at
the
larger
story
is
very
common
and
part
of
getting
and
disseminating
news.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
but
it
was
only
about
half
instance
that
the
raid
didn’t
come
that
night.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
and
if
there
had
been
a
raid
that
night,
could
we
possibly
say
that
the
constitutional
issue
turns
on
the
fact
that
the
raid
was
there
and
he
covered
it
and
published
it
whereas
--
because
the
police,
perhaps
even
knew
he
was
there,
i
don’t
know,
didn’t
raid
that
night.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
right.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no
questions
about
that.
the
only
other
thing
i
want
to
say
is
that
i
submit
to
you
that
it’s
more
important
than
an
occasional
indictment
that
an
earl
caldwell
be
allowed
to
do
in-depth
stories
on
the
black
panthers.
mr.
branzburg
be
allowed
to
show
that
hashish
is
available,
readily
available
to
kids
in
two
counties
in
kentucky.
that
mr.
pappas
be
allowed
to
report
a
police
raid
from
the
inside.
we
know
these
stories
would
never
get
to
the
public
if
it
were
not
for
the
confidentiality
and
for
the
fact,
the
people
who
gave
them
permission
thought
that
they
were
entitled
to
impose
a
privilege.
the
justice
concurring
in
the
knops
case
said
it
better
than
i
could.
i
know
of
no
period
in
history
where
any
freedoms
have
flourished
in
the
face
of
the
states
curtailment
of
the
free
flow
of
information,
that’
s
what
we’re
fighting
for
here.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes.
i
think
there
a
number
of
factors,
your
honor.
in
the
first
place,
i
think
there
has
been
much
agreement
between
prosecutors
and
newsmen
over
the
years
in
the
past.
i
think
that
in
addition
to
that
that
there
has
been
a
flood
of
subpoenas
more
recently
as
we
get
into
the
problem
of
minorities
and
radical
groups.
we
have
our
reporters
today,
doing
things
they
never
did
before.
reporters
themselves,
i
used
to
be
one.
i
would
tell
you
that
our
reporters
today
are
much
more
investigative,
more
sophisticated,
more
daring.
here’s
pappas,
he
put
his
life
on
the
line
by
being
inside
the
headquarters
in
order
to
report
from
the
inside.
this,
i
think
is
of
relatively
recent
origin
when
combined
also
with
the
concept
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutor
that
here
is
a
man
who
is
on
the
scene
and
who
could
provide
an
available
investigative
arm
of
the
government.
all
these
things
have
come
to
the
front
at
a
time,
at
a
sudden
time
just
in
the
way
that
perhaps
in
griswold,
the
question
which
you
think
would
go
back
for
100
years
did
not
arise
until
that
particular
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
combination,
that’s
correct.
and
as
my
brother
suggested
a
few
minutes
ago,
here
in
the
course
of
a
year
and
a
half,
nbc,
cbs,
we’re
getting
four
subpoenas
a
month
recently.
they
didn’t
get
those
counter
subpoenas
back
in
the
old
days,
123
subpoenas
between
january
of
1969
and
july
of
1970.
and
if
this
court
affirms
this
case,
i
can
assure
you
that
reporters
will
be
spending
a
lot
more
time
in
grand
juries
and
in
courtrooms
than
they
are
in
reporting
from
now
on.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
my
test
would
mean
only
your
honor
that
the
court
might,
in
that
instance,
have
little
difficulty
in
indicating
particularly
if
the
ammunition
had
been
used,
had
been
part
of
some
greater
difficulty.
might
have
in
balancing
the
interest,
might
well
find
in
that
case
that
the
interest
of
the
prosecutor
and
of
the
grand
jury,
if
you
will,
overrode
the
first
amendment.
but
the
privilege
would
come
into
effect,
yes,
because
he
was
there
and
saw
it
under
a
confidential
umbrella.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
certainly.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
it
wasn’t,
it’s
a
commonwealth
[voice
overlap].
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
i
think
if
i
may
suggest
it,
it’s
a
very
fortunate
one,
because
the
confidence
was
deemed
to
have
such
order
in
that
case
that
they
actually
enforced
it.
in
other
words,
if
i’m
using
the
case
as
an
illustration
that
a
confidence,
would
rather
than
being
improper
in
a
way
to
silence
the
reporter,
it
was
in
that
case,
a
way
of
getting
the
larger
story.
and
if
they
had
abide
it
by
their
agreement
that
they
had
entered
into
and
had
taken
films
which
did
not
show
inmates
without
their
permission
then
that
would
have
been
an
instance
of
a
story
of
great
benefit
to
the
public
where
they
nevertheless
could
have
gotten
it
only
by
agreeing
to
a
confidentiality.
now,
it
so
it
happen
that
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no
question
about
it.
that’s
right.
but
i
think
the
fact
that
he
attempted
to
break
it
and
in
the
court
saw
it
of
such
a
high
order
just
to
enforce
it
by
injunction.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
quite
true
and
you're
going
to
have
instances
of
clashes
in
these
cases
occasionally
between
with
sixth
amendment
right
to
call
it
an
assist,
first
amendment
right
of
the
reporter.
this
is
nothing
new.
these
kinds
of
clashes
and
balances
are
quite
common
in
constitutional
adjudication.
the
kind
that
the
courts
face
constantly
and
the
courts
are
facing
them
right
now
below
and
finally,
i
might
say,
decided
them
in
our
favor.
