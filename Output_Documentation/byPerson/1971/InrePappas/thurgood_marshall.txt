justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
prettyman,
is
that
the
normal
subpoena
in
massachusetts
in
that
general
language?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it’s
no
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that’s
what
i
assumed
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
why,
i
was
thinking
was
it
under
that,
must
i
cast
question
in
asked
in
the
first
case?
in
massachusetts,
everybody,
including
those
with
privileges,
like
attorney-client,
physician-patient,
everybody
else
with
that
general
subpoena
would
have
to
go
except
the
newsman.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that’s
not
my
point.
my
point
is
they
might
be
wanting
to
question
him
about
a
homicide
by
an
automobile
which
he
happen
to
witness
on
his
way
to
work.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
mean,
but
--
if
he
was
a
newspaperman
he
wouldn’t
go.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
on
this
day,
he
went
there
and
told
the
people,
whatever
you
say,
i’ll
keep
it
in
confidence.
and
the
next
day,
he
witnessed
the
(inaudible)
and
he
gets
this
general
subpoena.
then
he
looks
i
understand
the
opposition
say
he
moved
up.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
why
does
he
have
to
be
more
specific
about
this
automobile
accident
with
the
reporter
than
with
anybody
else?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why?
because
he
is
a
reporter.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
no.
this
is
a
reporter,
who
has
confidential
information
in
an
entirely
different
situation
he
witnessed
a
crime
merely
because
he
is
a
reporter
you
have
to
give
him
some
kind
of
a
hearing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
merely
because
he
is
a
reporter.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
how
does
the
grand
jury
know
that
he’s
got
this
confidential
information,
in
my
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
let’s
get
at
the
facts
right
now.
he’s
got
confidential
information
and
he
witnessed
the
crime,
two
separate
things.
one
was
in
boston
and
one
was
in
cambridge
(ph).
and,
he
gets
his
subpoena,
he
come
to
the
grand
jury
and
he
said,
“uh,
uh,
solely
because
i
am
a
reporter,
now
go,
you
got
to
tell
me
what
you
want.”
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
right,
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
hadn’t
printed
that
yet.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
nobody
knows
he’s
got
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then
he
still
--
he
gets
different
treatment
on
the
subpoena.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
problem.
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
is
to
--
i
may
add
to
my
point,
let’s
be
really
specific.
a
newspaperman
and
i
both
see
a
crime.
can
i
get
a
grand
jury
subpoena,
only
thing
i
am
obliged
to
do
is
to
go
and
the
newspaperman
doesn’t
have
to
go.
justice
thurgood
marshall
solely
because
he’s
newspaper.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
your
position?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
did
newspaperman
received
information
in
confidence,
which
he
never
probably
publish
to
any
place?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
knew,
does
the
fact
that
he
has
this
information
or
the
fact
that
he’s
a
newspaper
reporter?
that’s
my
only
point.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
have
to
ask
for
that
in
my
case,
i
just
want
--
talking
about
this
crime.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
my
whole
problem
is,
if
the
procedure
that
you
sit
on
is
something
in
addition
to
what
we’d
normally
have
in
the
judicial
presence.
normally,
when
you
get
a
subpoena
for
grand
jury
you
can
move
to
quash,
that’s
about
all
you
can
do
or
you’re
going
to
go
into
a
jail,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but,
the
newspaperman
according
to
you
doesn’t
have
to
move
to
quash.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
you
aren’t
distinct
in
going
into
the
grand
jury
room.
we
both
go
into
the
grand
jury
room.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
say
that
if
they
ask
him
about
the
crime,
he
would
of
course
testify
to
it.
and
i
would
require
the
most
--
apart
from
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
would
testify.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that’s
where
i
didn’t
understand
your
prohibition
to
be.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
physician
has
to
testify
to
the
crime
he
himself
committed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
physician
would
have
to
testify
as
to
the
crime
he
himself
committed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
crime
was
committed
by
two
strangers
doing.[voice
overlap]
justice
thurgood
marshall
except
the
ordinary
person,
it’s
everybody
except
the
president
of
the
united
states
and
the
reporter,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
agree
with
my
brother
stewart,
i
don’t
see
why
you
keep
on
arguing
that
point
with
your
case
[laughter].
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
we
get
to
decide
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
during
the
time
that
pappas
was
in
there,
i
assume
the
police
authorities
knew
what
was
going
on.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
they
knew
that
the
burning
was
going
on
and
the
barricades
were
up
and
everything.
justice
thurgood
marshall
couldn’t
have
gotten
a
search
warrant
and
they
found
all
of
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
without
pappas?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
the
record
--
couldn’t
also
speculate
that
they
might
have
decided,
well,
we
saw
pappas
go
in
there,
we
can
subpoena
him
and
find
out
what’s
in
there.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
the
trouble
when
you
get
off
into
possibilities.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
the
trouble
when
you
get
into
possibilities.
but
it
--
well,
it’s
not
a
questionable
possibility.
a
search
warrant
could’ve
been
obtained.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
did
appear
before
the
grand
jury,
he
did
answer
questions
after
that
that
he
said
--
we’re
given
to
him
in
confidence.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
is
mr.
prettyman
correct
that
the
commonwealth
put
in
no
evidence
to
show
any
basic
need
for
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
as
it
--
well,
i’m
aware,
put
in
any
testimony
until
today
on
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
the
answer
to
my
question
is,
you
did
not.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
much
attention
do
you
think
the
black
panthers
would
pay
to
pappas
if
he
testified?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
have
to
add
one
little
point,
he
wasn’t
called,
he
volunteered?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
before
a
legislative
committee
that
adds
your
point
went
up.
would
you
talk
to
him
in
confidence
after
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
he
was
called
before
a
grand
jury
and
testified,
you
would
not
hold
that
against
him,
i
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
i’m
sure
you
wouldn’t.
i
wouldn’t
--
justice
thurgood

mr.
