unknown
speaker
you
don’t
really,
in
your
case,
mr.
prettyman,
you
have
to
take
the
position
at
all
that
he
had
a
right
not
to
appear.
now,
i
understand
that
if
you
support
the
caldwell
holding
and
you
had
cleared
us
that
you
do.
but,
the
facts
of
your
case
don’t
require
you
to
if
this
were
the
only
case
here?
unknown
speaker
because
your
man
did
up
here
and
he
did
answer
questions
as
to
his
name
and
occupation
and
so
on,
and
it
was
only
plan
they
got
to
this
to
the
interrogation
about
what
had
happened
inside
the
headquarters,
that
he
said,
“i
refuse
to
answer.”
so
during
the
facts
of
your
case,
that’s
where
we
now
are.
unknown
speaker
but
he
did
appear.
unknown
speaker
he
did
respond
to
the
subpoena,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
but,
he
has
done
it
once.
he
did
do
it;
it’s
not
part
of
it
--
not
necessarily
part
of
your
case.
unknown
speaker
you’re
not
saying
here
that
this
class,
the
people
don’t
have
to
appear,
you
say,
they
may
not
have
to
testify?
unknown
speaker
and
that
has
a
prosecution?
unknown
speaker
that
many
of
them
at
that
status
--
in
other
forms?
unknown
speaker
my
question
didn’t
suggest
that
they
were
equivalent
rights,
but
only
that
they
were
equally
protected.
unknown
speaker
[voice
overlap]
the
statute.
well,
i
don’t
think
you
mean
that.
they
are
equally
protected,
but
you
said
they’re
not
equivalent
rights.
one
is
a
broader
right.
unknown
speaker
you
would
apply
the
same
privilege;
i
take
it
to
the
trial?
unknown
speaker
the
same
rule?
unknown
speaker
i’ve
already
questioned,
your
arguing
somebody
else’s
case
and
now
i’m
going
to
ask
you,
did
you
refer
to
the
caldwell
case
in
a
trial,
the
rational
for
the
ninth
circuit’s
decision
in
caldwell
just
wouldn’t
exist,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
yes,
because
he’ll
be
appearing
in
a
room,
open
to
the
public
and
everybody
would
know
whether
or
not
he
spilled
the
beans.
unknown
speaker
would
it
in
your
view
of
the
privilege,
would
it
ever
expire?
let
us
assume
the
reporter
said,
“i
have
no
more
news
to
report
about
this
particular
group
or
activity.
my
relationship
with
the
group
is
over.
don’t
ever
expect
to
get
any
more
news
out
of
that
particular
situation.
unknown
speaker
but
there
is
--
but
i
do
have
an
area
of
unpublished
news
that
i
promised
not
to
reveal.”
unknown
speaker
oh!
yes!
he
could
but
he
chooses
not
to.
unknown
speaker
although
he
couldn’t
argue
that
by
withholding
this
amount
of
news,
i
am
going
to
get
some
more
news
out
of
it.
and
he
says,
i
never
to
expect
to
get
anymore
out
of
it.
unknown
speaker
well
not
only
with
that
circle
with
others,
you
are
saying?
unknown
speaker
is
this
case,
in
other
words
general
hurley,
differs
from
the
other
two
and
that
you
understand
the
record
mr.
pappas
promised
not
to
write
any
newspapers
stories
or
anything
else,
even
changing
identities
and
so
on,
just
not
to
write
any
newspaper
stories
at
all.
unknown
speaker
by
contrast
to
the
other
two
cases
where
it
was
a
publication
of
newspaper
stories
that
triggered
apparently
the
grand
jury
investigation,
right?
unknown
speaker
and
nothing
was
in
fact
ever
written
about
that.
unknown
speaker
what
happened?
unknown
speaker
and
he
did
from
inside
then?
unknown
speaker
general
hurley
--
unknown
speaker
does
massachusetts’
procedure
provide
for
a
motion
to
quash
a
criminal
subpoena
on
the
ground
of
oppressiveness
or
burdensomeness?
unknown
speaker
and,
what
massachusetts’
procedure
there
re
--
supposing
some
other
claim,
other
than
a
reporter’s
privilege
were
asserted,
would
massachusetts’
procedure
require
that
the
state
bear
the
burden
or
that
the
person
claiming
the
oppressiveness
or
burdensomeness
bear
the
burden?
unknown
speaker
of
course
i
suppose
pappas’
position
is
that
he
did
make
some
sort
of
a
showing
of
major
of
burdensomeness
or
oppressive,
and
as
justice
marshall
points
out,
the
state
came
back
with
nothing.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
you
wouldn’t
like
the
constitutional
rules
in
it.
unknown
speaker
but
in
this
case,
mr.
prettyman,
there
never
was
a
story,
larger
or
smaller?
unknown
speaker
yes.
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
my
equation
didn’t
require
this
--
i
thought
there
was
any
impropriety,
i
was
just
differentiating
this
case
from
the
--
unknown
speaker
other
two
and
in
so
far
as
that
in
the
other
two
cases,
there
were
stories
published
in
the
newspaper.
unknown
speaker
i
--
mr.
prettyman
--
unknown
speaker
maybe
you
indicated
it
already
but
what
in
your
view
accounts
for
the
fact
that
this
basic
question
is
arising
now
for
the
first
time
after
almost
200
years
since
the
--
is
that
a
first
amendment
and
had
a
free
press
and
had
grand
juries?
unknown
speaker
it’s
combination
of
things
that
have
all
caused
at
that
same
time?
unknown
speaker
mr.
prettyman,
if
i
can
bother
you
one
more
question?
unknown
speaker
i
wondered
about
your
reference
to
the
wiseman
case
and
i
think
it
was
the
wiseman.
unknown
speaker
what
happens
if
the
reporter
made
the
deal
and
then
wanted
to
break
it?
unknown
speaker
you
don’t

in
