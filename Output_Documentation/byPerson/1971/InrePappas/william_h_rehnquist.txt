justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
prettyman,
do
you
say
that
one
of
your
standards
is
that
if
a
grand
jury
must
be
investigating
a
specific
crime
that
sounds
simple,
but
i
think
if
to
me
that
imposes
some
problems.supposing
you
have
a
grand
jury
convene
to
say
investigate
an
ambulance
chasing
ring
with
police
participation
as
they
recently
had
in
chicago
or
a
widespread
graft
and
corruption
among
officials?
and
i
take
it
at
the
outset
of
that
investigation
you
can’t
say
that
any
--
there
is
probable
cause
to
indict
any
particular
individual.
you
are
not
even
sure
a
crime
was
committed.
would
that
come
within
your
definition
of
a
specific
crime?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
then
is
your
answer
to
my
question?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
they
do
come
forward
and
say
that
we’re
investigating
allegations
of
an
ambulance
chasing
rocket
with
police
connivance
and
violations,
which
could
be
violations
of
several
state
statutes
and
say
no
more
than
that.
does
that
meet
your
test
to
the
specific
crime?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
prettyman,
in
the
georgia
case
which
you
mentioned
and
about
which
the
chief
justice’s
questioned
you
a
moment
ago.
if
it
is
demonstrable
that
the
grand
jury
simply
is
not
investigating
any
criminal
activity
or
any
legitimate
act,
might
it
not
be
that
all
persons
including
reporters
would
have
a
privilege
against
testifying
in
that
situation
that
that
might
not
depend
on
a
peculiar
reportorial
privilege.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
(inaudible)
mr.
hurley,
wouldn’t
it
be
fair
to
say
that
the
flow
of
information
might
be
cut
down
even
though
there
wasn’t
a
breach
of
confidence
just
because
you
--
the
first
time
you
would
not
contemplate
of
the
possibility
of
the
grand
jury
investigation,
even
though
it
wasn’t
--
which
is
not
a
breach
of
confidence,
it
was
a
publication
or
identification,
a
view
with
the
information
that
you
don’t
want
to
take
a
chance
on
having
come
about
again.
