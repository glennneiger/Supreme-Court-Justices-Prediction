chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
70-94,
in
the
matter
of
paul
pappas.
mr.
prettyman
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
right
there,
mr.
prettyman
that
an
unexpected
event
took
place
then,
not
the
police
raid,
but
suppose
some
internal
quarrel
of
the
group
resulted
in
one
of
them
killing
another
in
his
site.
do
you
think
that
pledge
of
confidence
would
be
protected?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let’s
reduce
the
crime
now,
instead
of
the
killing,
just
a
serious
injury,
same
procedure?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
say
the
same
result
would
obtain
if
while
there,
he
observed
the
packaging
or
processing
heroin
from
the
raw
state
to
street
sale
state?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
does
that
do
to
his
credibility
with
these
people,
i
suppose
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
prettyman,
i’m
not
sure
i
track
the
analogy
that
you
introduced
about
off
the
record
background
news
conferences.
was
it
your
position
that
if
--
let
us
say
a
congressional
committee
took
it
away
from
the
court
for
a
moment
and
call
this
newspaper
reporter
and
said,
what
the
president
or
some
else,
some
other
public
official
say
to
you
in
this
background
conference?
he
would
have
the
same
kind
of
privilege
not
to
dispose
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
in
its
fullest
and
so
bring
it
back
into
the
grand
jury
then.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
kind
to
stay
over
on
the
analogy
and
the
background
press
conference
because
you
seemed,
i
thought
to
rely
on
some
analogy.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
the
grand
jury
says,
what
did
the
secretary
of
state
or
someone
else
say
to
you
in
that
background
press
conference,
privilege?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
grand
jury.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i’m
afraid
i’m
confused
now
about
that
analogy
to
the
background
press
conference
or
the
off
the
record.
perhaps,
i
am
duly
influenced
by
what
we
all
do,
read
the
newspapers.
i
thought
the
press
had
taken
the
position
now
that
they
would
not
accept
backgrounder
off
the
record
statements
under
any
circumstances.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
don’t
they
have
to
come
and
test
--
don’t
they
have
to
come
at
least
to
appear,
mr.
prettyman
and
then
assert
the
privilege?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
since
you
distinguished
them,
and
where
would
you
put
television,
speech
or
press?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
prettyman,
going
back
to
your
prior
statement
about
the
“bad
grand
jury
conduct”
down
in
georgia
or
some
place.
do
you
suggest
that
the
court
can
engage
in
constitutional
adjudication
on
a
very
important
matter
on
the
basis
that
some
grand
juries
sometimes
abuse
their
powers?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh!
that
doesn’t
quite
get
to
my
question.
you
seemed
to
place
great
weight
on
the
fact
that
one
grand
jury
that
you
recited
abused
its
powers
and
i
would
assume
it’s
true
that
grand
juries
do.
is
that
a
basis
for
constitutional
adjudication?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
prettyman.
mr.
hurley.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
analogize
this
tour
that
he
was
getting
as
a
sort
of
visual
backgrounder?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
it’s
quite
a
different
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
you
may
--
you
may
finish
your
sentence.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
hurley.
mr.
prettyman.
oh!
excuse
me.
i’m
not
ready
with
you
yet
mr.
prettyman.
mr.
reynolds.
i
take
it
that
you’re
going
to
focus
your
argument
as
defend
to
the
court
or
specifically
as
it
relates
to
this
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
all
i
had
in
mind
is
that
you
need
not
repeat
your
former
arguments.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
reynolds.
mr.
prettyman,
you
have
about
three
minutes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
prettyman
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
prettyman,
another
hypothetical
since
we’ve
got
to
test
all
these
propositions.
suppose
on
going
into
the
headquarters,
the
reporter
was
horrified
to
find
as
i
am
sure
you
would
horrified
if
he
found
what
i’m
about
to
suggest,
a
great
arsenal
that
had
20
flame
throwers,
50
machine
guns,
whole
stack
of
automatic
riffles,
cases
and
boxes
full
of
dynamite
for
making
bombs.
your
test
would
mean
that
he
would
have
his
lips
sealed
and
he
cannot
tell
that
to
the
grand
jury
investigating
this
whole
problem
of
potential
disorder
and
civil
disturbance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
prettyman.
mr.
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
did
you
not
have
some
other
intervening
first
amendment
rights
of
other
people,
the
rights
of
these
prisoners
not
to
be
on
television,
standing
around
in
the
nude
as
they
were,
herded
almost
in
an
animal-like
fashion
and
great
many
other
indignities,
isn’t
there
a
very
great
difference
with
the
intervention
of
the
individual
rights
of
those
prisoners?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
prettyman.
thank
you,
mr.
hurley.
thank
you,
mr.
reynolds.
