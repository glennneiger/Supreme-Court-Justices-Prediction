mr.
prettyman,
i
take
it
then
that
you
say
that
the
balancing
goes
on,
on
an
ad
hoc
basis
in
each
particular
case,
on
a
specific
factor
of
this
case?

without
any
general
rules

standards?
justice
byron

well,
what
you
would
require,
shall
they
say
we
need
this
evidence
to
prove
a
crime,
the
packages
of
heroin
or
the
making
of
bombs
or
murder,
or
something
like
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
on
that
matter,
the
point
--
just
a
necessity
to
make
the
criminal
case
wouldn’t
be
automatically
enough,
would
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you’d
have
to
distinguish
between
crimes.

i
suppose
if
you’re
going
really
to
achieve
your
purpose
of
maintaining
the
flow
of
information.
the
--
there
must
be
some
predictability
involved
in
applying
these
rules
you’re
suggesting.
and
i
just
wonder
if
the
rules
you
suggested
would
allow
any
person
who
was
worried
about
disclosure
to
predict
whether
a
reporter’s
claim
and
privilege
would
be
respected
or
not,
in
this
particular
case,
on
an
ad
hoc
case
to
case
balancing?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
it's
just
sort
of
an
odd
thing,
i
mean
it’s
much
more
likely
that
not
that
the
privilege
would
be
respected
in
none
of
the
cases.
