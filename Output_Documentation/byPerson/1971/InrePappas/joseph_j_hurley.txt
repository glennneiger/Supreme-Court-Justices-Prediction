mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
may
i
say
at
the
outset
that
in
my
view
there’s
no
question
here
whether
a
newsman’s
confidences
are
going
to
be
protected
or
not.
the
real
question
is
to
what
extent
and
how,
by
what
means,
and
in
what
circumstances?
i
do
say
however,
with
respect
to
the
contention
that
mr.
pappas
makes
that
as
i
understand
his
contention,
a
newsman
merely
by
virtue
of
being
a
newsman,
as
an
indispensable
part
of
his
job,
if
you
will,
must
be
given
the
privilege
not
to
give
evidence
that
he
has
acquired
about
a
crime,
because
he
has
acquired
it
“in
confidence”
and
that
the
reason
for
this
privilege
and
the
reason
it
arises
to
the
constitutional
level
is
that
without
this
privilege,
there
will
be
substantial
interference,
substantial
impairment
of
the
right
of
free
press.
now,
the
commonwealth
position
is
with
respect
that
this
court
is
not
in
a
position
to
rule
as
judge
zirpoli
found
in
the
district
court
opinion
in
caldwell
that
it
is
indispensable
that
a
newsman,
all
newsmen
under
all
conditions
have
this
privilege,
qualified
though
it
maybe,
that
it
is
essential
to
the
operation
of
a
free
press
that
newsmen
have
this
privilege.
i
submit
that
unless
this
court
can
rule
that
such
a
privilege
is
indispensable
to
the
operation
of
a
free
press,
this
case
does
not
rise
to
the
constitutional
level.
and
it
then
becomes
a
matter
at
least
so
far
as
the
state
courts
are
concerned
for
the
states
to
determine
whether
and
to
what
extent
newsmen
will
be
privileged
whether
it’s
a
qualified
or
an
absolute
privilege
not
to
disclose
evidence
of
crime
if
they
have
obtained
in
confidence.
a
matter,
in
other
words,
for
legislation
in
the
states
and
absent
legislation,
a
matter
for
the
same
judicial
protection
afforded
to
any
citizen
against
improper,
oppressive,
unreasonable
inquiry,
whether
it
be
by
a
grand
jury
or
whether
it
be
on
the
witness
stand
in
the
course
of
a
trial.
i
think
i
should
state
a
few
additional
facts
of
the
pappas
situation
because
some
of
the
facts
that
my
brother
has
given,
i
think
may
alter
my
view
of
the
legal
problem
involved
here.
and
particularly
the
point
as
to
the
terms
and
conditions
under
which
pappas
entered
the
black
panther
headquarters
on
this
night.
and
my
brother
stated,
if
i
understood
him
correctly,
that
the
agreement
was
that
pappas
would
be
allowed
into
the
black
panther
headquarters
with
the
understanding
he
would
report
nothing,
except
a
police
raid
and
then
if
there
were
a
police
raid
all
bets
were
off.
and
if
my
brother
meant
that
it’s
his
understanding
that
the
agreement
was
that
if
there
was
a
raid,
any
question
of
confidence
ended,
i
submit
that’s
not
what
the
record
shows.
and
i
think
this
difference
is
important
for
this
reason.
i
say
the
record
shows
clearly
that
what
pappas
agreed
to
do
was
to
keep
in
confidence,
not
to
report
anything
he
saw
or
heard
inside
that
headquarters
on
that
night
except
a
police
raid.
in
other
words,
what
pappas
was
agreeing
to
do
is
not
the
ordinary
newsman
confidential
source
situation.
what
pappas
was
agreeing
to
do
was
to
silence
himself
as
to
event
“a”,
namely
what
might
go
on
inside
that
headquarters
other
than
in
the
course
of
a
police
raid,
as
the
price
of
a
possible
story
about
event
“b”,
the
police
raid.
what
i’m
really
saying
is,
that
if
this
court
should
disagree
and
rule
that
it
is
indispensable
to
a
free
press
that
a
reporter
have
such
a
privilege
then
certainly
the
court
should
rule
that
that
privilege
does
not
extend
to
a
situation
where
a
reporter
seals
his
lips,
not
for
the
purpose
of
getting
information,
which
he
is
going
to
use
in
one
way
or
another
as
a
reporter,
but
where
he
silences
himself
as
the
price
of
a
story.
because
i
submit
the
two
are
substantially
different.
in
the
second
situation,
the
situation
that
existed
here
is
almost
like
the
situation
postulated
by
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
reporter
who
sees
a
crime
merely
as
a
witness
and
not
as
a
newsman.
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
he
agreed,
your
honor
--
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
that’s
right
your
honor,
he
agreed
--
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
no,
nothing
was
ever
written.
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
there
was
no
raid
he
never
did
--
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
he
never
did
write
anything,
that
is
true
your
honor.
that
is
true.
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
backgrounder?
i
would
say
no,
your
honor.
i
would
draw
a
distinction,
suppose
pappas
had
been
really
writing
about
the
black
panthers,
and
as
my
brother
said,
for
all
if
the
record
knows,
unlike
mr.
caldwell,
mr.
pappas
is
certainly
not
an
expert
on
the
black
panther.
i
don’t
say
that
to
disparage
him
but
merely
to
point
out
a
fact.
but
let’s
suppose
he
were
engaged
in
becoming
an
expert
on
the
black
panthers,
and
he
said,
“look,
let
me
in
and
let
me
find
out
what
you
people
really
do
in
there
and
i
won’t
report
it,
but
it
will
be
useful
to
me.
i
want
to
find
out
your
side.
i
want
to
be
able
to
report
your
side,
not
specifically
what
goes
on
in
here
but
just
to
enrich
my
understanding
of
the
panthers,
as
background.”
if
he
had
done
that,
i
would
not
be
making
the
point
i
am
now
making.
but
he
didn’t
and
i
think
it’s
important
to
keep
that
in
mind.
i
would
also
like
to
develop
just
somewhat
more
--
the
fact
situation
because
a
suggestion
has
been
made
not
so
much
perhaps
in
my
brother’s
oral
argument
as
in
his
brief
and
reply
brief
that
there
may
be
some
suspicion
here
as
to
how
seriously
motivated
this
grand
jury
was,
whether
there
was
a
fishing
expedition
or
possibly
politically
motivated.
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
your
honors
that
the
record
shows
that
in
new
bedford,
in
july
of
1970,
and
specifically
on
the
30
--
on
the
30th
day
of
july,
pappas
was
brought
in
from
providence
because
there
were
fires
going
on
and
he
himself
was
told
by
his
own
station
“they
seem
to
be
burning
the
city
down.”
that
doesn’t
mean
that
there
was
a
rush
of
accidental
fires,
the
only
inference
is
there’s
something
going
on.
particularly,
when
you
couple
that
with
and
these
are
the
words
his
own
counsel
used
at
the
hearing
in
the
superior
court,
“there
was
turmoil
there,
you
went
to
report
on
the
turmoil,
the
disturbances,
the
disorders,”
and
pappas
said
yes.
so,
he’s
obviously
called
in,
not
to
report
another
great
new
bedford
fire
because
there’s
something
in
the
nature
of
--
if
you
will,
a
riot,
a
civil
disorder
going
on.
the
barricades,
they
are
mentioned.
my
brother
at
one
point
in
his
brief
wants
the
court
to
infer
that
these
may
have
been
police
lines.
well,
obviously
the
language
of
the
street
barricade
is
not
that
of
the
police
line,
but
i
think
we
can
infer
it
from
pappas’
own
testimony,
in
the
superior
court,
as
it
appears
in
the
record
that
he
tried
to
get
initially
to
the
point
where
he
was
told
to
go
for
the
conference,
the
panther
headquarters,
and
he
couldn’t
get
there
because
there
was
a
barricade.
that’s
not
a
police
line,
he
left
and
he
reported
this
fact
to
his
station
and
was
told
a
few
minutes
later,
“go
back,
they
will
now
let
you
in.”
that’s
not
the
way
we
identified
public
authority.
and
this
becomes
even
clearer
because
the
statement
that
was
read,
which
mr.
pappas
did
hear
outside
in
the
street
and
did
report
said
in
part
that
they,
the
area
people
will
let
the
police
into
the
area,
not
into
the
stores,
my
brother
said,
but
into
the
area
provided
they
have
a
search
warrant,
provided
there
gentlemanly,
provided
they
bring
the
press.
now
this
is
not
the
language
of
a
police
line,
there
is
no
question
as
our
court
noticed
that
there
were
serious
civil
disorders,
that
these
involve
exclusion
of
the
public
from
various
areas
of
new
bedford,
not
by
the
police.
we
were
dealing
in
other
words,
with
a
situation
amounting
to
or
smacking
of
anarchy,
civil
revolution,
if
you
will.
and
indeed,
well,
it’s
not
in
the
record,
the
grand
jury
that
questioned
or
sought
to
question
pappas
did
return
some
indictments
against
individuals
in
connection
with
conspiracy,
with
weapons
offenses.
and
pappas
was
asked
about
whether
there
was
ammunition
in
the
panther
headquarters.
and
while
i’m
on
that
point,
again,
i
submit
to
the
court,
there
could
have
been
no
question
in
mr.
pappas
mind,
what
he
was
being
interrogated
about
before
the
grand
jury.
it’s
true,
the
form
of
the
subpoena
was
general,
but
be
--
perhaps
it
was
necessarily
general
because
the
grand
jury
was
not
inquiring
into
a
specific
crime,
commonwealth
versus
jones,
it
was
looking
into
a
general
situation,
the
disorders
that
occurred
in
new
bedford
at
this
time.
and
pappas
was
asked
and
did
respond,
was
he
there
and
how
he
happen
to
be
there
in
the
circumstances
and
so
forth,
so
there
was
never
any
question
in
his
mind
that
what
they
wanted
to
know
from
him
and
the
questions
that
he
was
asked
that
he
refuse
to
answer
all
related
to
what
he
saw
and
heard
in
that
black
panther
headquarters
in
this
period
of
three
hours
that
he
was
there,
there
never
couldn’t
have
been
any
doubt
in
his
mind,
certainly
at
that
point
as
to
what
the
grand
jury
wanted
to
know
from
him
and
the
fact
that
he
refuse
to
answer
questions
and
the
indictments
i
referred
to
were
now
crossed
by
the
district
attorney
subsequently
because
of
his
decision,
there
wasn’t
enough
evidence.
and
maybe
if
they
had
gotten
pappas
evidence,
they
would’ve
been
enough,
but
they
certainly
can’t
think
of
any
question
in
his
mind
as
to
what
he
was
being
asked
about.
so
far
as
the
facts
are
concerned,
therefore,
i
would
like
to
stress
them
for
--
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
that
he
was
there
and
what
--
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
yes,
your
honor
they
did.
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
i
suppose
they
could’ve.
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
i
think
they
could’ve
your
honor.
i
think
what
may
have
been
involved
is
this
and
i
think
it
may
explain
why
these
barricades
were
permitted
to
exist.
i
think
a
decision
was
made
and
i’m
not
speaking
of
any
personal
knowledge.
but
i
think
that
a
decision
was
made,
let’s
not
move
in,
let’s
see
if
we
can
work
this
thing
out
by
discussion
and
settlement
because
there
were
negotiations
going
on
with
the
groups
involved.
let’s
stay
back,
let’s
not
put
the
police
in,
let’s
not
have
direct
--
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
i
think
that’s
a
possibility,
your
honor.
but
i
think
it
is
no
more
--
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
i
believe
--
i
can’t
say
your
honor
that
it
could’ve
been.
i
don’t
know
that
at
that
point
they
had
enough
evidence,
truthfully
i
don’t.
it’s
possible
they
didn’t
know
but
they
only
suspect
it,
but
there
wasn’t
enough
evidence
to
get
it.
truthfully
i
cannot
say
yes
or
no.
but
let’s
assume
he
did
--
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
he
told
that
he
was
there
and
that
he
made
this
agreement
and
then
he
said,
you
know,
when
they
started
asking
about
he
saw
during
in
the
headquarters,
he
declined
--
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
at
this
point,
no
your
honor,
i
don’t
--
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
there
has
--
there's
never
been
any
occasions
to
give
any,
until
today
your
honor
and
i
submit
there
was
no
occasion
then
--
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
because
of
the
procedural
context
at
that
time.
and
what
happened
was
this,
pappas
and
incidentally,
pappas
had
already
made
one
appearance,
before
this
grand
jury,
previously
and
then,
when
summons
begin.
pappas
got
the
subpoena
and
there
was
a
motion
to
quash.
now
procedurally
the
question
before
the
superior
court
judge
was
whether
or
not
pappas
had
a
privilege,
as
he
claimed,
and
he
claim,
there’s
no
question,
he
claimed
it
from
the
outset,
a
qualified
privilege,
not
to
give
his
evidence
because
he
was
a
newsman
and
because
he
got
that
evidence
in
confidence
as
a
newsman.
the
superior
court
in
effect
said,
“look,
let’s
assume
that
so
that
there’s
no
law
giving
you
that
privilege,”
at
least
until
now
and
i
say,
until
this
day,
until
this
court
acts
in
these
cases.
there’s
no
law
giving
a
newsman
such
a
privilege,
as
a
general
proposition.
and
the
superior
court
judge
reported
the
matter
to
the
supreme
judicial
court
for
determination.
there’s
no
opportunity,
there’s
no
occasion,
there’s
no
need
for
the
commonwealth
to
come
forward
at
that
point,
and
say
--
well,
the
issue
here
is
whether
or
not
he’s
got
a
privilege,
but
we’re
now
going
to
put
in
evidence
as
to
why
we
need
his
testimony.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
your
honor,
with
respect,
i
think
the
inference
that
you
can
draw
from
all
the
evidence
is,
that
there
was
a
need.
the
situation
i’ve
outlined,
pappas
--
the
evidence
he
is
--
was
the
only
non-panther
in
the
headquarters.
and
therefore,
i
would
say
that
there
was
no
occasion,
and
there’s
still
is
no
occasion
for
the
commonwealth
to
meet
any
burden.
and
unless
until
this
court
says,
there
is
a
privilege,
then
there
is
no
burden.
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
the
commonwealth
has
not.
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
the
commonwealth
did
cross-examine
pappas.
that
is
the
only
extent
to
which
the
commonwealth
participated;
presented
any
evidence,
yes
your
honor
that
was
true.
but
i
say
there
was
no
need,
there
was
no
occasion.
now,
if
this
court
rules
that
there
is
a
privilege,
then
the
burden
would
arise
and
presumably
would
be
met.
but
until
that,
i
submit
that
there
is
no
occasion
for
it,
there
is
no
burden
on
the
commonwealth.
now
--
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
court
has
recognized
that
in
its
decision
in
this
case.
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
well,
if
your
honor
please,
i
would
say
this,
that
the
burden
is
and
should
be
on
the
one
who
claims
the
exemption.
i
say
that
should
be
true
with
a
newsman
or
anyone.
suppose
i
was
subpoenaed,
for
example,
to
testify
before
a
grand
jury
in
the
western
part
of
a
state
on
the
matter
about
which
obviously
i
know
nothing.
i
think
the
burden
is
on
me
to
come
to
the
court
and
say,
“look,
their
subpoenaing
me,
and
i
have
no
knowledge
of
this
situation.
why
do
i
have
to
make
this
trip?”
i
think
the
burden
is
on
me,
then,
it
would
be
up
to
the
court,
the
burden
would
not
shift,
but
perhaps
the
burden
of
going
forward
would
shift
to
the
commonwealth,
why
are
you
subpoenaing
this
individual?
and
i
think
this
is
no
difference
whether
it’s
a
question
of
invocation
of
a
right
to
maintain
a
confidence
or
that
i
have
nothing
to
contribute.
i
am
being
harassed.
they’ve
got
the
wrong
man.
our
court
recognizes
it.
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
well,
has
he
made
it
a
showing
really
your
honor
or
has
the
press
at
all
made
a
showing
beyond
the
statement
that
it
is
necessary
that
we
have
this
right
or
our
new
sources
are
going
to
dry
up.
i
mean
pappas
said
that.
he
said
that
himself
before
the
superior
court
judge
who
heard
it.
but
it
--
does
that
--
what
does
that
really
prove?
i
mean,
if
you
will,
go
beyond
the
record
in
this
case,
and
i
say
there’s
nothing
really
here
that
proves
that
there
is
a
need
for
such
a
privilege.
but
let’s
go
into
the
caldwell
affidavits.
and
if
you
take
the
affidavits
of
the
many
eminent
and
respective
newsmen
there,
i
was
struck
by
this
fact
and
each
one
they’re
saying
that
i
get
a
great
deal
of
information
in
confidence.
this
is
also
borne
out
by
the
guest
stanzler
survey,
which
was
mentioned
in
argument
this
morning.
i
get
a
great
deal
of
information
in
confidence,
unless
you
give
me
a
privilege,
people
aren’t
going
to
come
to
me
and
give
me
information
in
confidence.
but
the
short
answer
is,
not
to
give
a
short
answer,
there’s
no
privilege
now,
as
we’ve
pointed
out
this
morning.
there
never
has
been
and
yet
they’re
getting
the
information.
so
that
to
say
we’re
not
going
to
get
information
in
the
future,
unless
you
recognize
this
privilege,
it
seems
to
me
it
is
not
a
logical
consequence
from
the
fact
they’ve
been
getting
information
over
the
years
in
confidence,
even
though
there
is
no
privilege.
i
wonder
as
a
practical
matter,
how
much
attention
does
the
informant
pay
to
this
question,
at
all?
i
wonder,
for
example,
if
the
panthers
have
been
asked
that
night,
now
do
you
really
expect
that
not
only
is
paul
pappas
not
going
to
report
anything
he
hears
in
there,
but
he’s
never
going
to
testify
about
it
or
if
he’s
questioned,
for
example,
it
was
mentioned
if
there
was
a
fight,
or
an
injury,
or
a
murder.
he’s
not
going
to
answer
police
questions.
is
that
what
you
really
mean?
they
didn’t
say
that,
the
language
of
the
agreement
was
report.
and
i
really
wonder
how
much
attention
informant’s
pay
to
this
privilege.(voice
overlap)
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
i’m
sure
your
honor
that
he
would
--
if
he
testified,
the
black
panthers
would
be
unhappy,
but
--
[laughter]
as
was
pointed
out
in
the
caldwell
case
and
i
think
it
is
important
here
that
the
panthers
present
an
unusually
sensitive
news
source.
and
it
seems
to
me,
the
caldwell
decision,
as
it
states
both
in
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
in
this
case,
on
these
facts,
and
we’re
dealing
with
this
unusually
sensitive
new
source,
but
i
don’t
think
a
general
rule
can
be
made
on
that
basis.
i
don’t
think
that
proves,
just
because
there
may
be
some
source,
which
is
unduly
sensitive.
that
all
sources
are
so
sensitive
that
it
rises
to
the
level
--
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
they
were
talking?
oh!
by
all
means,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
testify?
--
i
would,
because
i
would
not
--
i
would,
because
i
would
not
regard
testifying
as
a
breach
of
the
agreement,
because
i
would
not
expect
that
if
i
said
to
a
reporter,
“you
can’t
print
this,”
that’s
not
an
agreement,
that
if
he
is
called
to
the
witness
stand
and
questioned
that
he
is
supposed
to
suffer
in
silence
for
my
sake.
that
he
--
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
if
he
volunteered?
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
to
testify?
i
would
--
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
i
truthfully
got
to,
if
i
would,
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
would
go
--
that
would
approach
breaking
the
confidence,
but
that’s
not
what
were
dealing
with
here.
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
unfortunately,
i
am
not
up
for
appointment,
so
that
--
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
it
is.
it’s
a
different
situation.
i
would
point
out
that
judge
smith
in
the
superior
court,
hearing
this,
pointed
this
fact
out
to
pappas
that
i
have
talked
to
newsman
for
40
years
in
confidence
and
never
one
has
broken
my
confidence.
and
i
respect
you,
even
though
i
think
you’re
wrong,
i
respect
you
for
preserving
the
confidence
or
seeking
to
preserve
it.
but
that’s
not
the
legal
issue
and
i’ve
got
to
report
to
the
supreme
judicial
court,
because
i
have
no
right
to
rule,
that
you
have
the
right
to
be
silent.
so,
we’re
not
--
it’s
not
a
--
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
i
would
not,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
because
i
would
not
regard
that
as
a
breach
of
the
agreement,
a
breach
of
the
confidence.
i
don’t
--
i
wonder
whether
the
panthers
really
would
regard
it
as
a
breach.
they
wouldn’t
like
it,
but
i
wonder
if
they’d
really
regard
it
as
a
breach
of
the
confidence,
viewing
it
is
a
--
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
well,
your
honor,
i’m
not
saying
that
the
newsman
is
unprotected.
the
only
question
is
how
do
we
do
it?
do
we
hand
him
a
shield
as
it
were
and
let
him
put
that
up
and
say,
“all
i
have
to
prove
is,
i’m
a
newsman
and
i
got
in
confidence.”
now,
you
come
forward,
and
i
don’t
have
time
your
honors,
but
if
you
look
at
the
burden
that
the
pappas
contention
would
place
on
the
state,
it
would
just
destroy
the
grand
jury
system,
it’s
completely
unworkable.
so
i’m
not
saying
that
you
don’t
ever
protect
a
newsman.
all
i’m
saying
is
how
do
you
do
it?
you
do
it
the
way
all
the
court
said
you
do
it.
mr.
pappas
comes
in
and
says,
“i
got
this
in
confidence,”
and
the
courts
got
to
make
a
determination,
including
hearing
from
the
government,
“why
do
you
need
this
man?
why
do
you
need
this
evidence?”
make
a
determination
on
an
individual
case
basis.
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
no,
your
honor,
i
wouldn’t.
i
don’t
think
you
have
to.
i
think
it’s
unworkable,
it’s
unrealistic,
and
it’s
unnecessary.
i’m
interested,
for
example
just
quickly
looking
at
the
appendix
in
caldwell,
all
the
121
subpoenas.
they
were
served
on
nbc
and
abc
over
31
months.
first
of
all,
only
72
of
them
were
in
criminal
cases,
18
in
grand
juries,
and
43
of
them
in
criminal
cases
were
by
defendants,
not
by
the
prosecution.
and
out
of
all
those
that
was
served
by
the
prosecution,
and
that
121,
excluding
three
that
came
out
of
the
caldwell
grand
jury,
there’s
only
one
that
i
would
describe
as
possibly
seeking
confidential
information
from
a
reporter
and
that
was
a
subpoena
to
a
station,
to
bring
in
effect
everything
you’ve
got
on
the
mafia
or
cosa
nostra
and
some
other
named
individuals.
the
only
one
that
you
could
possible
say
and
of
all
these
121,
only
seven
of
them
where
subpoenas
ad
testificandum
and
those
were
all
served
by
defendants
in
criminal
cases.
so,
i
wonder
really
is
this
the
practical
problem?
the
evidence
of
those
subpoenas
suggests
to
me
that
it
isn’t
the
practical
problem.
we
are
dealing
with
the
unusual
situation.
i
don’t
mean
to
minimize
the
importance
of
the
problem
by
saying
it
really
occurred,
but
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
solution
is
not
in
ruling
that
every
newsman
has
got
a
constitutional
right,
and
he’s
got
to
have
it.
we
give
an
attorney
a
privilege
why?
to
do
his
job,
can
it
really
be
said
that
every
newsman
to
do
his
job
has
got
to
have
an
analogous
and
a
greater
privilege?
the
newsman
privilege
would
be
greater
than
my
privilege,
as
i
understand
it
because
not
everything
i
get
in
confidence
from
a
client
is
privilege.
if
he
tells
me
he’s
going
to
commit
a
crime,
i’m
not
privileged
not
to
testify,
and
yet
the
newsman
would
be.
and
the
answer
is
by
doing
it
in
an
individual
basis,
either
under
legislation,
if
the
legislature
sees
fit
to
enact
it.
or
let
the
court
protect
as
the
court
protects
every
citizen
against
unreasonable
inquiry.
and
if
the
individual
doesn’t
have
to
prove
that
the
whole
inquiry
is
unreasonable
or
oppressive,
as
my
brother
suggest,
i
think.
but
only
that
the
questions
directed
to
him
are
unreasonable.
and
finally
as
a
practical
matter,
we
all
know
as
practical
men
prosecutors
don’t
pick
fights
with
the
press.
we
know
reporters
work
out
accommodations.
reporters
do
come
forward.
everybody
learns
in
public
life,
you
don’t
pick
fights
with
the
press
because
they
go
to
press
everyday.
i
wonder
therefore,
are
we
going
to
leave
the
press
as
helpless
as
it
is
suggested,
if
this
privilege
is
not
held
to
exist.
i
think
it
was
oscar
wilde
who
said,
“in
america,
the
president
reigns,”
and
that’s
his
words,
not
mine,
“for
four
years,
but
the
press
rules
forever.”
and
i
think
there’s
a
great
deal
of
practical
common
sense
in
saying,
“sure,
let’s
protect
the
reporter
and
his
confidence.”
when
in
a
particular
case,
it
is
shown
as
a
result
as
a
judicial
inquiry
that
the
harm
to
him
in
his
capacity
as
a
reporter
outweighs
the
public
good
that
would
be
served
and
remember,
we’re
talking
--
i’m
finish
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
i
just
wanted
to
say,
we’re
talking
here
as
i
think
my
brother
has
agreed
not
about
a
right
that
exists
for
the
press,
it’s
a
public
right.
and
the
question
in
each
case
is
this
public
right,
the
two
sides
of
a
same
coin
which
is
more
important
in
a
particular
case.
the
public’s
right
to
know
through
the
press
or
the
public’s
right
to
know
through
the
court.
and
that’s
the
problem
that’s
got
to
be
resolved.
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
may
i
say
at
the
outset
that
in
my
view
there’s
no
question
here
whether
a
newsman’s
confidences
are
going
to
be
protected
or
not.
the
real
question
is
to
what
extent
and
how,
by
what
means,
and
in
what
circumstances?
i
do
say
however,
with
respect
to
the
contention
that
mr.
pappas
makes
that
as
i
understand
his
contention,
a
newsman
merely
by
virtue
of
being
a
newsman,
as
an
indispensable
part
of
his
job,
if
you
will,
must
be
given
the
privilege
not
to
give
evidence
that
he
has
acquired
about
a
crime,
because
he
has
acquired
it
“in
confidence”
and
that
the
reason
for
this
privilege
and
the
reason
it
arises
to
the
constitutional
level
is
that
without
this
privilege,
there
will
be
substantial
interference,
substantial
impairment
of
the
right
of
free
press.
now,
the
commonwealth
position
is
with
respect
that
this
court
is
not
in
a
position
to
rule
as
judge
zirpoli
found
in
the
district
court
opinion
in
caldwell
that
it
is
indispensable
that
a
newsman,
all
newsmen
under
all
conditions
have
this
privilege,
qualified
though
it
maybe,
that
it
is
essential
to
the
operation
of
a
free
press
that
newsmen
have
this
privilege.
i
submit
that
unless
this
court
can
rule
that
such
a
privilege
is
indispensable
to
the
operation
of
a
free
press,
this
case
does
not
rise
to
the
constitutional
level.
and
it
then
becomes
a
matter
at
least
so
far
as
the
state
courts
are
concerned
for
the
states
to
determine
whether
and
to
what
extent
newsmen
will
be
privileged
whether
it’s
a
qualified
or
an
absolute
privilege
not
to
disclose
evidence
of
crime
if
they
have
obtained
in
confidence.
a
matter,
in
other
words,
for
legislation
in
the
states
and
absent
legislation,
a
matter
for
the
same
judicial
protection
afforded
to
any
citizen
against
improper,
oppressive,
unreasonable
inquiry,
whether
it
be
by
a
grand
jury
or
whether
it
be
on
the
witness
stand
in
the
course
of
a
trial.
i
think
i
should
state
a
few
additional
facts
of
the
pappas
situation
because
some
of
the
facts
that
my
brother
has
given,
i
think
may
alter
my
view
of
the
legal
problem
involved
here.
and
particularly
the
point
as
to
the
terms
and
conditions
under
which
pappas
entered
the
black
panther
headquarters
on
this
night.
and
my
brother
stated,
if
i
understood
him
correctly,
that
the
agreement
was
that
pappas
would
be
allowed
into
the
black
panther
headquarters
with
the
understanding
he
would
report
nothing,
except
a
police
raid
and
then
if
there
were
a
police
raid
all
bets
were
off.
and
if
my
brother
meant
that
it’s
his
understanding
that
the
agreement
was
that
if
there
was
a
raid,
any
question
of
confidence
ended,
i
submit
that’s
not
what
the
record
shows.
and
i
think
this
difference
is
important
for
this
reason.
i
say
the
record
shows
clearly
that
what
pappas
agreed
to
do
was
to
keep
in
confidence,
not
to
report
anything
he
saw
or
heard
inside
that
headquarters
on
that
night
except
a
police
raid.
in
other
words,
what
pappas
was
agreeing
to
do
is
not
the
ordinary
newsman
confidential
source
situation.
what
pappas
was
agreeing
to
do
was
to
silence
himself
as
to
event
“a”,
namely
what
might
go
on
inside
that
headquarters
other
than
in
the
course
of
a
police
raid,
as
the
price
of
a
possible
story
about
event
“b”,
the
police
raid.
what
i’m
really
saying
is,
that
if
this
court
should
disagree
and
rule
that
it
is
indispensable
to
a
free
press
that
a
reporter
have
such
a
privilege
then
certainly
the
court
should
rule
that
that
privilege
does
not
extend
to
a
situation
where
a
reporter
seals
his
lips,
not
for
the
purpose
of
getting
information,
which
he
is
going
to
use
in
one
way
or
another
as
a
reporter,
but
where
he
silences
himself
as
the
price
of
a
story.
because
i
submit
the
two
are
substantially
different.
in
the
second
situation,
the
situation
that
existed
here
is
almost
like
the
situation
postulated
by
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
reporter
who
sees
a
crime
merely
as
a
witness
and
not
as
a
newsman.
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
he
agreed,
your
honor
--
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
that’s
right
your
honor,
he
agreed
--
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
no,
nothing
was
ever
written.
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
there
was
no
raid
he
never
did
--
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
he
never
did
write
anything,
that
is
true
your
honor.
that
is
true.
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
backgrounder?
i
would
say
no,
your
honor.
i
would
draw
a
distinction,
suppose
pappas
had
been
really
writing
about
the
black
panthers,
and
as
my
brother
said,
for
all
if
the
record
knows,
unlike
mr.
caldwell,
mr.
pappas
is
certainly
not
an
expert
on
the
black
panther.
i
don’t
say
that
to
disparage
him
but
merely
to
point
out
a
fact.
but
let’s
suppose
he
were
engaged
in
becoming
an
expert
on
the
black
panthers,
and
he
said,
“look,
let
me
in
and
let
me
find
out
what
you
people
really
do
in
there
and
i
won’t
report
it,
but
it
will
be
useful
to
me.
i
want
to
find
out
your
side.
i
want
to
be
able
to
report
your
side,
not
specifically
what
goes
on
in
here
but
just
to
enrich
my
understanding
of
the
panthers,
as
background.”
if
he
had
done
that,
i
would
not
be
making
the
point
i
am
now
making.
but
he
didn’t
and
i
think
it’s
important
to
keep
that
in
mind.
i
would
also
like
to
develop
just
somewhat
more
--
the
fact
situation
because
a
suggestion
has
been
made
not
so
much
perhaps
in
my
brother’s
oral
argument
as
in
his
brief
and
reply
brief
that
there
may
be
some
suspicion
here
as
to
how
seriously
motivated
this
grand
jury
was,
whether
there
was
a
fishing
expedition
or
possibly
politically
motivated.
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
your
honors
that
the
record
shows
that
in
new
bedford,
in
july
of
1970,
and
specifically
on
the
30
--
on
the
30th
day
of
july,
pappas
was
brought
in
from
providence
because
there
were
fires
going
on
and
he
himself
was
told
by
his
own
station
“they
seem
to
be
burning
the
city
down.”
that
doesn’t
mean
that
there
was
a
rush
of
accidental
fires,
the
only
inference
is
there’s
something
going
on.
particularly,
when
you
couple
that
with
and
these
are
the
words
his
own
counsel
used
at
the
hearing
in
the
superior
court,
“there
was
turmoil
there,
you
went
to
report
on
the
turmoil,
the
disturbances,
the
disorders,”
and
pappas
said
yes.
so,
he’s
obviously
called
in,
not
to
report
another
great
new
bedford
fire
because
there’s
something
in
the
nature
of
--
if
you
will,
a
riot,
a
civil
disorder
going
on.
the
barricades,
they
are
mentioned.
my
brother
at
one
point
in
his
brief
wants
the
court
to
infer
that
these
may
have
been
police
lines.
well,
obviously
the
language
of
the
street
barricade
is
not
that
of
the
police
line,
but
i
think
we
can
infer
it
from
pappas’
own
testimony,
in
the
superior
court,
as
it
appears
in
the
record
that
he
tried
to
get
initially
to
the
point
where
he
was
told
to
go
for
the
conference,
the
panther
headquarters,
and
he
couldn’t
get
there
because
there
was
a
barricade.
that’s
not
a
police
line,
he
left
and
he
reported
this
fact
to
his
station
and
was
told
a
few
minutes
later,
“go
back,
they
will
now
let
you
in.”
that’s
not
the
way
we
identified
public
authority.
and
this
becomes
even
clearer
because
the
statement
that
was
read,
which
mr.
pappas
did
hear
outside
in
the
street
and
did
report
said
in
part
that
they,
the
area
people
will
let
the
police
into
the
area,
not
into
the
stores,
my
brother
said,
but
into
the
area
provided
they
have
a
search
warrant,
provided
there
gentlemanly,
provided
they
bring
the
press.
now
this
is
not
the
language
of
a
police
line,
there
is
no
question
as
our
court
noticed
that
there
were
serious
civil
disorders,
that
these
involve
exclusion
of
the
public
from
various
areas
of
new
bedford,
not
by
the
police.
we
were
dealing
in
other
words,
with
a
situation
amounting
to
or
smacking
of
anarchy,
civil
revolution,
if
you
will.
and
indeed,
well,
it’s
not
in
the
record,
the
grand
jury
that
questioned
or
sought
to
question
pappas
did
return
some
indictments
against
individuals
in
connection
with
conspiracy,
with
weapons
offenses.
and
pappas
was
asked
about
whether
there
was
ammunition
in
the
panther
headquarters.
and
while
i’m
on
that
point,
again,
i
submit
to
the
court,
there
could
have
been
no
question
in
mr.
pappas
mind,
what
he
was
being
interrogated
about
before
the
grand
jury.
it’s
true,
the
form
of
the
subpoena
was
general,
but
be
--
perhaps
it
was
necessarily
general
because
the
grand
jury
was
not
inquiring
into
a
specific
crime,
commonwealth
versus
jones,
it
was
looking
into
a
general
situation,
the
disorders
that
occurred
in
new
bedford
at
this
time.
and
pappas
was
asked
and
did
respond,
was
he
there
and
how
he
happen
to
be
there
in
the
circumstances
and
so
forth,
so
there
was
never
any
question
in
his
mind
that
what
they
wanted
to
know
from
him
and
the
questions
that
he
was
asked
that
he
refuse
to
answer
all
related
to
what
he
saw
and
heard
in
that
black
panther
headquarters
in
this
period
of
three
hours
that
he
was
there,
there
never
couldn’t
have
been
any
doubt
in
his
mind,
certainly
at
that
point
as
to
what
the
grand
jury
wanted
to
know
from
him
and
the
fact
that
he
refuse
to
answer
questions
and
the
indictments
i
referred
to
were
now
crossed
by
the
district
attorney
subsequently
because
of
his
decision,
there
wasn’t
enough
evidence.
and
maybe
if
they
had
gotten
pappas
evidence,
they
would’ve
been
enough,
but
they
certainly
can’t
think
of
any
question
in
his
mind
as
to
what
he
was
being
asked
about.
so
far
as
the
facts
are
concerned,
therefore,
i
would
like
to
stress
them
for
--
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
that
he
was
there
and
what
--
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
yes,
your
honor
they
did.
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
i
suppose
they
could’ve.
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
i
think
they
could’ve
your
honor.
i
think
what
may
have
been
involved
is
this
and
i
think
it
may
explain
why
these
barricades
were
permitted
to
exist.
i
think
a
decision
was
made
and
i’m
not
speaking
of
any
personal
knowledge.
but
i
think
that
a
decision
was
made,
let’s
not
move
in,
let’s
see
if
we
can
work
this
thing
out
by
discussion
and
settlement
because
there
were
negotiations
going
on
with
the
groups
involved.
let’s
stay
back,
let’s
not
put
the
police
in,
let’s
not
have
direct
--
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
i
think
that’s
a
possibility,
your
honor.
but
i
think
it
is
no
more
--
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
i
believe
--
i
can’t
say
your
honor
that
it
could’ve
been.
i
don’t
know
that
at
that
point
they
had
enough
evidence,
truthfully
i
don’t.
it’s
possible
they
didn’t
know
but
they
only
suspect
it,
but
there
wasn’t
enough
evidence
to
get
it.
truthfully
i
cannot
say
yes
or
no.
but
let’s
assume
he
did
--
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
he
told
that
he
was
there
and
that
he
made
this
agreement
and
then
he
said,
you
know,
when
they
started
asking
about
he
saw
during
in
the
headquarters,
he
declined
--
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
at
this
point,
no
your
honor,
i
don’t
--
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
there
has
--
there's
never
been
any
occasions
to
give
any,
until
today
your
honor
and
i
submit
there
was
no
occasion
then
--
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
because
of
the
procedural
context
at
that
time.
and
what
happened
was
this,
pappas
and
incidentally,
pappas
had
already
made
one
appearance,
before
this
grand
jury,
previously
and
then,
when
summons
begin.
pappas
got
the
subpoena
and
there
was
a
motion
to
quash.
now
procedurally
the
question
before
the
superior
court
judge
was
whether
or
not
pappas
had
a
privilege,
as
he
claimed,
and
he
claim,
there’s
no
question,
he
claimed
it
from
the
outset,
a
qualified
privilege,
not
to
give
his
evidence
because
he
was
a
newsman
and
because
he
got
that
evidence
in
confidence
as
a
newsman.
the
superior
court
in
effect
said,
“look,
let’s
assume
that
so
that
there’s
no
law
giving
you
that
privilege,”
at
least
until
now
and
i
say,
until
this
day,
until
this
court
acts
in
these
cases.
there’s
no
law
giving
a
newsman
such
a
privilege,
as
a
general
proposition.
and
the
superior
court
judge
reported
the
matter
to
the
supreme
judicial
court
for
determination.
there’s
no
opportunity,
there’s
no
occasion,
there’s
no
need
for
the
commonwealth
to
come
forward
at
that
point,
and
say
--
well,
the
issue
here
is
whether
or
not
he’s
got
a
privilege,
but
we’re
now
going
to
put
in
evidence
as
to
why
we
need
his
testimony.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
your
honor,
with
respect,
i
think
the
inference
that
you
can
draw
from
all
the
evidence
is,
that
there
was
a
need.
the
situation
i’ve
outlined,
pappas
--
the
evidence
he
is
--
was
the
only
non-panther
in
the
headquarters.
and
therefore,
i
would
say
that
there
was
no
occasion,
and
there’s
still
is
no
occasion
for
the
commonwealth
to
meet
any
burden.
and
unless
until
this
court
says,
there
is
a
privilege,
then
there
is
no
burden.
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
the
commonwealth
has
not.
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
the
commonwealth
did
cross-examine
pappas.
that
is
the
only
extent
to
which
the
commonwealth
participated;
presented
any
evidence,
yes
your
honor
that
was
true.
but
i
say
there
was
no
need,
there
was
no
occasion.
now,
if
this
court
rules
that
there
is
a
privilege,
then
the
burden
would
arise
and
presumably
would
be
met.
but
until
that,
i
submit
that
there
is
no
occasion
for
it,
there
is
no
burden
on
the
commonwealth.
now
--
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
court
has
recognized
that
in
its
decision
in
this
case.
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
well,
if
your
honor
please,
i
would
say
this,
that
the
burden
is
and
should
be
on
the
one
who
claims
the
exemption.
i
say
that
should
be
true
with
a
newsman
or
anyone.
suppose
i
was
subpoenaed,
for
example,
to
testify
before
a
grand
jury
in
the
western
part
of
a
state
on
the
matter
about
which
obviously
i
know
nothing.
i
think
the
burden
is
on
me
to
come
to
the
court
and
say,
“look,
their
subpoenaing
me,
and
i
have
no
knowledge
of
this
situation.
why
do
i
have
to
make
this
trip?”
i
think
the
burden
is
on
me,
then,
it
would
be
up
to
the
court,
the
burden
would
not
shift,
but
perhaps
the
burden
of
going
forward
would
shift
to
the
commonwealth,
why
are
you
subpoenaing
this
individual?
and
i
think
this
is
no
difference
whether
it’s
a
question
of
invocation
of
a
right
to
maintain
a
confidence
or
that
i
have
nothing
to
contribute.
i
am
being
harassed.
they’ve
got
the
wrong
man.
our
court
recognizes
it.
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
well,
has
he
made
it
a
showing
really
your
honor
or
has
the
press
at
all
made
a
showing
beyond
the
statement
that
it
is
necessary
that
we
have
this
right
or
our
new
sources
are
going
to
dry
up.
i
mean
pappas
said
that.
he
said
that
himself
before
the
superior
court
judge
who
heard
it.
but
it
--
does
that
--
what
does
that
really
prove?
i
mean,
if
you
will,
go
beyond
the
record
in
this
case,
and
i
say
there’s
nothing
really
here
that
proves
that
there
is
a
need
for
such
a
privilege.
but
let’s
go
into
the
caldwell
affidavits.
and
if
you
take
the
affidavits
of
the
many
eminent
and
respective
newsmen
there,
i
was
struck
by
this
fact
and
each
one
they’re
saying
that
i
get
a
great
deal
of
information
in
confidence.
this
is
also
borne
out
by
the
guest
stanzler
survey,
which
was
mentioned
in
argument
this
morning.
i
get
a
great
deal
of
information
in
confidence,
unless
you
give
me
a
privilege,
people
aren’t
going
to
come
to
me
and
give
me
information
in
confidence.
but
the
short
answer
is,
not
to
give
a
short
answer,
there’s
no
privilege
now,
as
we’ve
pointed
out
this
morning.
there
never
has
been
and
yet
they’re
getting
the
information.
so
that
to
say
we’re
not
going
to
get
information
in
the
future,
unless
you
recognize
this
privilege,
it
seems
to
me
it
is
not
a
logical
consequence
from
the
fact
they’ve
been
getting
information
over
the
years
in
confidence,
even
though
there
is
no
privilege.
i
wonder
as
a
practical
matter,
how
much
attention
does
the
informant
pay
to
this
question,
at
all?
i
wonder,
for
example,
if
the
panthers
have
been
asked
that
night,
now
do
you
really
expect
that
not
only
is
paul
pappas
not
going
to
report
anything
he
hears
in
there,
but
he’s
never
going
to
testify
about
it
or
if
he’s
questioned,
for
example,
it
was
mentioned
if
there
was
a
fight,
or
an
injury,
or
a
murder.
he’s
not
going
to
answer
police
questions.
is
that
what
you
really
mean?
they
didn’t
say
that,
the
language
of
the
agreement
was
report.
and
i
really
wonder
how
much
attention
informant’s
pay
to
this
privilege.(voice
overlap)
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
i’m
sure
your
honor
that
he
would
--
if
he
testified,
the
black
panthers
would
be
unhappy,
but
--
[laughter]
as
was
pointed
out
in
the
caldwell
case
and
i
think
it
is
important
here
that
the
panthers
present
an
unusually
sensitive
news
source.
and
it
seems
to
me,
the
caldwell
decision,
as
it
states
both
in
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
in
this
case,
on
these
facts,
and
we’re
dealing
with
this
unusually
sensitive
new
source,
but
i
don’t
think
a
general
rule
can
be
made
on
that
basis.
i
don’t
think
that
proves,
just
because
there
may
be
some
source,
which
is
unduly
sensitive.
that
all
sources
are
so
sensitive
that
it
rises
to
the
level
--
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
they
were
talking?
oh!
by
all
means,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
testify?
--
i
would,
because
i
would
not
--
i
would,
because
i
would
not
regard
testifying
as
a
breach
of
the
agreement,
because
i
would
not
expect
that
if
i
said
to
a
reporter,
“you
can’t
print
this,”
that’s
not
an
agreement,
that
if
he
is
called
to
the
witness
stand
and
questioned
that
he
is
supposed
to
suffer
in
silence
for
my
sake.
that
he
--
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
if
he
volunteered?
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
to
testify?
i
would
--
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
i
truthfully
got
to,
if
i
would,
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
would
go
--
that
would
approach
breaking
the
confidence,
but
that’s
not
what
were
dealing
with
here.
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
unfortunately,
i
am
not
up
for
appointment,
so
that
--
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
it
is.
it’s
a
different
situation.
i
would
point
out
that
judge
smith
in
the
superior
court,
hearing
this,
pointed
this
fact
out
to
pappas
that
i
have
talked
to
newsman
for
40
years
in
confidence
and
never
one
has
broken
my
confidence.
and
i
respect
you,
even
though
i
think
you’re
wrong,
i
respect
you
for
preserving
the
confidence
or
seeking
to
preserve
it.
but
that’s
not
the
legal
issue
and
i’ve
got
to
report
to
the
supreme
judicial
court,
because
i
have
no
right
to
rule,
that
you
have
the
right
to
be
silent.
so,
we’re
not
--
it’s
not
a
--
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
i
would
not,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
because
i
would
not
regard
that
as
a
breach
of
the
agreement,
a
breach
of
the
confidence.
i
don’t
--
i
wonder
whether
the
panthers
really
would
regard
it
as
a
breach.
they
wouldn’t
like
it,
but
i
wonder
if
they’d
really
regard
it
as
a
breach
of
the
confidence,
viewing
it
is
a
--
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
well,
your
honor,
i’m
not
saying
that
the
newsman
is
unprotected.
the
only
question
is
how
do
we
do
it?
do
we
hand
him
a
shield
as
it
were
and
let
him
put
that
up
and
say,
“all
i
have
to
prove
is,
i’m
a
newsman
and
i
got
in
confidence.”
now,
you
come
forward,
and
i
don’t
have
time
your
honors,
but
if
you
look
at
the
burden
that
the
pappas
contention
would
place
on
the
state,
it
would
just
destroy
the
grand
jury
system,
it’s
completely
unworkable.
so
i’m
not
saying
that
you
don’t
ever
protect
a
newsman.
all
i’m
saying
is
how
do
you
do
it?
you
do
it
the
way
all
the
court
said
you
do
it.
mr.
pappas
comes
in
and
says,
“i
got
this
in
confidence,”
and
the
courts
got
to
make
a
determination,
including
hearing
from
the
government,
“why
do
you
need
this
man?
why
do
you
need
this
evidence?”
make
a
determination
on
an
individual
case
basis.
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
no,
your
honor,
i
wouldn’t.
i
don’t
think
you
have
to.
i
think
it’s
unworkable,
it’s
unrealistic,
and
it’s
unnecessary.
i’m
interested,
for
example
just
quickly
looking
at
the
appendix
in
caldwell,
all
the
121
subpoenas.
they
were
served
on
nbc
and
abc
over
31
months.
first
of
all,
only
72
of
them
were
in
criminal
cases,
18
in
grand
juries,
and
43
of
them
in
criminal
cases
were
by
defendants,
not
by
the
prosecution.
and
out
of
all
those
that
was
served
by
the
prosecution,
and
that
121,
excluding
three
that
came
out
of
the
caldwell
grand
jury,
there’s
only
one
that
i
would
describe
as
possibly
seeking
confidential
information
from
a
reporter
and
that
was
a
subpoena
to
a
station,
to
bring
in
effect
everything
you’ve
got
on
the
mafia
or
cosa
nostra
and
some
other
named
individuals.
the
only
one
that
you
could
possible
say
and
of
all
these
121,
only
seven
of
them
where
subpoenas
ad
testificandum
and
those
were
all
served
by
defendants
in
criminal
cases.
so,
i
wonder
really
is
this
the
practical
problem?
the
evidence
of
those
subpoenas
suggests
to
me
that
it
isn’t
the
practical
problem.
we
are
dealing
with
the
unusual
situation.
i
don’t
mean
to
minimize
the
importance
of
the
problem
by
saying
it
really
occurred,
but
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
solution
is
not
in
ruling
that
every
newsman
has
got
a
constitutional
right,
and
he’s
got
to
have
it.
we
give
an
attorney
a
privilege
why?
to
do
his
job,
can
it
really
be
said
that
every
newsman
to
do
his
job
has
got
to
have
an
analogous
and
a
greater
privilege?
the
newsman
privilege
would
be
greater
than
my
privilege,
as
i
understand
it
because
not
everything
i
get
in
confidence
from
a
client
is
privilege.
if
he
tells
me
he’s
going
to
commit
a
crime,
i’m
not
privileged
not
to
testify,
and
yet
the
newsman
would
be.
and
the
answer
is
by
doing
it
in
an
individual
basis,
either
under
legislation,
if
the
legislature
sees
fit
to
enact
it.
or
let
the
court
protect
as
the
court
protects
every
citizen
against
unreasonable
inquiry.
and
if
the
individual
doesn’t
have
to
prove
that
the
whole
inquiry
is
unreasonable
or
oppressive,
as
my
brother
suggest,
i
think.
but
only
that
the
questions
directed
to
him
are
unreasonable.
and
finally
as
a
practical
matter,
we
all
know
as
practical
men
prosecutors
don’t
pick
fights
with
the
press.
we
know
reporters
work
out
accommodations.
reporters
do
come
forward.
everybody
learns
in
public
life,
you
don’t
pick
fights
with
the
press
because
they
go
to
press
everyday.
i
wonder
therefore,
are
we
going
to
leave
the
press
as
helpless
as
it
is
suggested,
if
this
privilege
is
not
held
to
exist.
i
think
it
was
oscar
wilde
who
said,
“in
america,
the
president
reigns,”
and
that’s
his
words,
not
mine,
“for
four
years,
but
the
press
rules
forever.”
and
i
think
there’s
a
great
deal
of
practical
common
sense
in
saying,
“sure,
let’s
protect
the
reporter
and
his
confidence.”
when
in
a
particular
case,
it
is
shown
as
a
result
as
a
judicial
inquiry
that
the
harm
to
him
in
his
capacity
as
a
reporter
outweighs
the
public
good
that
would
be
served
and
remember,
we’re
talking
--
i’m
finish
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
j.
hurley
i
just
wanted
to
say,
we’re
talking
here
as
i
think
my
brother
has
agreed
not
about
a
right
that
exists
for
the
press,
it’s
a
public
right.
and
the
question
in
each
case
is
this
public
right,
the
two
sides
of
a
same
coin
which
is
more
important
in
a
particular
case.
the
public’s
right
to
know
through
the
press
or
the
public’s
right
to
know
through
the
court.
and
that’s
the
problem
that’s
got
to
be
resolved.
