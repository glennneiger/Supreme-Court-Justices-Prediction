no,
but
in
terms
of
section
3
(2)
says
that
the
request
either
made
by
the
representative
of
proctor
class
of
employee
or
by
the
carrier?
justice
william

douglas
i
am
reading
the
66th
amendment.
the
only
thing
he
has
is
if
his
union
questions
the
claim
and
looses
then
he
can
appeal.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
as
i
read
section
3
(2),
the
amendment
of
1966,
it
receives
complaints
only
by
unions
or
by
carriers?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
i
just
wondered
how
a
union
normally
would
be
the
spokesman,
if
they
are
reading
statement
taking
care
of
the
interest
of
the
employee
in
the
future,
but
if
the
employee
wants
to
put
this
thing
behind
him
and
get
out
of
the
business
and
never
go
back
and
work
again
than
the
union
is
might
not
be
a
very
good
representative
of
him?
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
is
what
the
statute
says
and
in
your
brief
instead
it’s
just
the
opposite.
