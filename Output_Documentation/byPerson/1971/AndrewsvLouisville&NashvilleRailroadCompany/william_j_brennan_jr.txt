justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
definitely
--
what
would
be
the
measure
of
damages
in
the
lawsuit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
i
gather
this
--
the
crux
of
the
liability
would
be
wrongful
discharge,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
before
the
board
i
gather
--
the
board
could
award
back
pay,
a
back
pay
for
wrongful
discharge,
but
nothing
in
excess
of
that
pay,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whereas
your
asking
damages
which
will
be
more
than
just
back
pay?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
not
in
--
wages
are
limited
to
lost
wages
theory,
are
they
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
in
your
lawsuit,
you'd
be
asking
for
damages
--
well
would
you
specify
that
again?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
say
anyway
[voice
overlap]
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
mr.
estes,
you
say
in
any
event
it's
a
law
question,
don't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whatever
measure
of
damages,
respective
of
what
might
be
the
limitation
if
he
followed
the
federal
rules
to
the
adjustment
board,
in
the
courtroom
if
you
are
allowed
to
bring
your
action
under
the
state
law
then
you
could
cover
whatever
they
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
have
these
questions
been
mooted
in
other
cases
that
you
know
mr.
estes?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
have
been
a
lot
of
these
types
of
cases
before?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
one
i
wrote?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
the
questions
we
have
been
putting
to
you
address
issues
really
not
before
us
in
this
case,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
if
we
would
overrule
moore
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
that
line
of
cases
that
would
mean
you
would
have
to
go
with
adjustment
board,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
i
recall
the
dissenters
in
walker
thought
we
should
follow
that
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
--
i
remember,
let
me
say
something,
walker
sometimes
took
10
years
to
get
through
the
adjustment
board,
can't
they
send
and
enact
a
statute
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
has
that
happened
or
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[voice
overlap]
five
years
you
mean
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
exactly
--
under
the
amended
statute
unlike
the
situation
of
the
time
price
was
decided,
is
it
they
are
now
a
judicial
review
of
that,
both
ways?
at
the
time
price
was
decided,
you
said
there
was
judicial
review
under
the
then
statutory
scheme
for
the
railroad,
but
not
for
the
employee
of
a
--
an
adjustment
board
decision,
isn't
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
now
under
the
new
statute
there
is
a
judicial
review,
is
it
there,
both
the
employee
as
well
the
railroad
may
have
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
we
said
in
price
there
was
no
judicial
review
at
all
on
the
part
of
--
available
to
the
employee?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
now
there
is
some
at
least
whatever
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
this
argument
didn't
affect
the
--
they
meant
that
moore
should
continue
to
be
effective
in
situations
where
it
might
properly
apply?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what's
the
employees
feel
now
on
the
66
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
de
novo?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
another
words
you
are
treating
the
board
pretty
much
as
an
arbitrator?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
is
that
true
on
both
sides
that
on
the
review
–
railroad
review
or
an
employee
review.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[voice
overlap]
is
that
can
an
employee
individually
go
to
an
adjustment
board?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
but
suppose
he
wants
to
go
to
the
adjustment
board
route,
you
mean
he
can't
go
unless
the
union
will
take
his
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that
--
if
that
so
then
what's
this
case
all
about.
he
has
no
administrative
remedy
you
are
telling.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
--
if
he
can't
go
with
his
grievances
independently
of
his
union
does
he
have
administrative
remedy
then?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
definitely
--
what
would
be
the
measure
of
damages
in
the
lawsuit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
i
gather
this
--
the
crux
of
the
liability
would
be
wrongful
discharge,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
before
the
board
i
gather
--
the
board
could
award
back
pay,
a
back
pay
for
wrongful
discharge,
but
nothing
in
excess
of
that
pay,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whereas
your
asking
damages
which
will
be
more
than
just
back
pay?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
not
in
--
wages
are
limited
to
lost
wages
theory,
are
they
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
in
your
lawsuit,
you'd
be
asking
for
damages
--
well
would
you
specify
that
again?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
say
anyway
[voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
mr.
estes,
you
say
in
any
event
it's
a
law
question,
don't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whatever
measure
of
damages,

what
might
be
the

if

walker
sometimes
took
10
years

can't
they
send

enact

has
that
happened
or
not?
justice
william

five
years
you
mean
--

how
exactly
--
under
