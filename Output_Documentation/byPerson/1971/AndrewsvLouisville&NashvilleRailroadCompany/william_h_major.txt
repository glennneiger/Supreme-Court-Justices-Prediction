mr.
william
h.
major
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
somehow
get
the
feeling
that
if
you
argue
in
favor
of
a
court
trial,
that
means
you
are
for
the
working
man
and
if
you
argue
in
favor
of
administrative
remedies,
that
means
you
are
for
the
railroad.
and
i
don't
think
that's
right
and
i
don't
think
it
is
reflected
in
the
congressional
history
of
this
act,
and
i
don't
think
it
is
now
the
present
thinking
of
labor
and
the
railroad
that,
that
is
correct.
i
submit
that
the
railway
labor
act
was
an
act
sought
by
both
the
unions
and
the
owners
of
the
railroad.
that
in
those
days
in
1926
when
the
act
came
into
being,
there
was
a
feeling
of
voluntariness
in
the
eyes
of
the
congress
that
they
could
simply
prod
one
side
and
the
other
side
by
means
of
the
railway
labor
act
and
achieve
the
desired
results.
and
that
is
what
is
done
in
the
area
of
major
disputes,
those
disputes
arising
out
of
giving
the
contract
to
start
off
with,
that's
where
the
union
has
a
right
to
strike
when
the
prodding
doesn't
work,
although
the
railroad
has
a
right
to
lock
out
and
that
is
on
a
voluntary
basis.
on
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
in
minor
disputes
where
you
have
the
interpretation
or
application
of
contracts;
both
the
union
and
the
railroad
have
been
in
favor
of
that
administrative
remedy.
now
i
don't
know
how
the
case
of
moore
ever
came
to
be
in
view
of
the
legislative
history
because
if
you
look
back
in
the
1934
amendments
which
took
place
of
course
shortly
after
the
passage
of
the
act,
when
they
found
that
the
minor
dispute
area
wasn't
working
because
of
the
fact
that
it
was
voluntary,
the
union
has
voluntarily
appointed
the
board
of
adjustment
members
and
the
railroad
voluntarily
appointed
their
members
and
neither
side
would
do
it,
and
they
found
that
wasn't
working.
and
both
the
unions
and
the
railroads
came
back
to
the
congress
and
in
effect
said,
it's
not
working
and
we
have
got
to
do
something
about
the
area
of
minor
disputes.
and
bear
in
mind
of
course
that
the
word
minor
dispute
is
a
word
of
art
that
the
framers
of
the
act
used
not
because
they
thought
that
the
disputes
were
minor,
but
to
distinguish
them
from
strike
issues,
they
used
that
word
of
art.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
when
the
amendment
was
in
the
committee,
it
was
proposed
by
the
federal
court
in
the
area
of
transportation,
an
office
that
no
longer
in
existence
but
he
said
the
existence
of
mandatory
boards
of
adjustment
would
create
nice
enough
and
more
consistent
in
the
interpretation
and
application
of
contracts.
mr.
william
h.
major
and
in
those
committee
hearings,
a
member
named
george
m.
harrison,
who
probably
had
as
many
credentials
as
a
union
may
have,
he
was
president
of
the
brotherhood
of
railway
and
steamship
clerks,
freight
handlers,
express
and
station
employees
and
appeared
as
chairman
of
the
legislative
committee
of
the
railway
labor
association,
he
said
this
in
substance.
he
said,
these
areas
of
minor
disputes
that
we
are
looking
at
in
the
form
of
the
compulsory
adjustment
board,
they
may
very
well
involve
a
man's
seniority,
a
man's
pay
for
amount
of
work
done,
his
promotion
rights
and
then
i
quote
him
as
saying,
it
may
very
well
concern
the
separation
of
the
employee
from
the
service,
whether
or
not
he
has
been
unjustly
discharged.
so
as
early
as
1934
in
the
congressional
hearings,
the
union
representatives
were
talking
about
mandatory
boards
of
adjustment
to
take
care
of
the
disputes
between
the
railroad
and
the
working
man
over
matters
of
promotions,
seniority,
rates
of
pay,
including
discharge.
and
then
this
court
came
along
and
decided
moore
in-spite
of
that
legislative
history.
even
more
remarkable
is
the
way
in
which
moore
was
decided.
you
understand
the
railway
labor
act
in
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
was
and
(inaudible)
in
moore.
it
wasn't
even
briefed
by
the
winning
side
as
a
matter
of
fact.
moore
came
upon
then
novel
erie
question.
moore
was
in
the
state
court
and
it
was
a
statue
of
limitation
questions
involved,
whether
a
one-year
statute
controlled
as
moore's
contract
or
the
six-year
written
contract
with
the
union
and
it
got
to
this
court
on
the
thinking
that
the
state
law
controlled.
as
a
matter
of
fact
later
on
in
amplifying
moore
and
distinguishing
moore
in
the
case
of
koppal,
this
court
held,
“you
must
exhaust
your
administrative
remedies
in
your
state
if
your
state
requires
exhaustive
remedies,
but
you
need
not
if
your
state
does
not
require
the
exhaustion
of
remedies.”
so,
you
have
moore
on
one
hand
and
koppal
on
the
other
hand,
one
of
them
saying
that
you
had
to
go
the
adjustment
board,
the
other
one
saying
it
didn't
depend
on
the
act
and
the
way
you
happen
to
be
fired,
as
it
were.
however
this
court
i
think
has
now
fully
and
finally
solved
the
question
of
whether
state
law
or
federal
law
applies.
i
think
in
the
case
of
textile
mills
versus
lincoln
--
textile
workers
versus
lincoln
mills,
decided
by
this
court
in
1957
and
also
the
case
of
international
associates
of
machinists
against
central
airlines,
this
court
has
once
and
forever
solved
the
problem
by
saying
that
anything
under
the
railway
labor
act
involving
minor
disputes
is
controlled
by
federal
law.
therefore,
when
we
say
that
this
man
who
has
been
discharged
doesn't
have
a
remedy
that's
available
to
the
middle
man,
as
he
has
expressed,
it's
contrary
to
the
thinking
that
the
unions
and
to
the
thinking
of
the
framers
of
the
bill
as
it
came
through
the
congress
and
it's
contrary
really
to
the
thinking
of
this
court.
it
is
true
that
--
mr.
william
h.
major
he
does
indeed,
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
william
h.
major
if
my
understanding
of
the
act
is
correct,
he
has
an
absolute
right
to
go
himself.
now,
where
he
may
not
be
able
to
go
himself
is
to
a
public
law
board.
mr.
william
h.
major
it
is
my
impression
that
the
66th
amendment
of
the
act
--
mr.
william
h.
major
reading
'j'
of
this
section,
it
says
parties
maybe
heard
even
in
person
by
council
or
by
other
representative
as
they
may
respectively
elect
and
i
would
assume
that
means
if
a
party
can
be
heard
in
person,
a
party
means
an
individual
rather
than
the
union,
i
would
guess.
mr.
william
h.
major
mr.
justice
douglas,
if
that
is
true
then
my
conception
of
the
railway
labor
act
or
my
dispute
is
erroneous
because
it
was
my
definite
impression
that
not
only
could
it
be
done,
but
it
was
being
done
daily
before
the
adjustment
board.
mr.
william
h.
major
that
is
always
of
course
a
possibility
mr.
justice
douglas.
in
that
connection
of
course
the
criticism
that
this
court
found
of
the
whole
situation
as
assumed
by
walker
against
the
southern
railroad
was
one
of
delay
and
another
of
inequity.
the
delay
that
has
been
referred
to
and
which
is
referred
to
in
that
decision
is
the
delay
of
adjustment
board.
the
first
division,
for
instance
had
a
delay
of
at
that
time
was
seven-and-a-half
years.
with
that
in
mind
the
congress
in
1966
attempted
to
remedy
the
situation
on
the
question
of
delay
and
again
it
is
quite
remarkable
in
the
committee
hearings
just
what
happened.
in
those
committee
hearings
there
was
days
and
days
of
hearings
and
so
there
is
all
kind
of
material
in
there,
but
the
remarkable
testimony
of
mr.
jesse
clark
who
identified
himself
as
president
of
brotherhood
of
signalmen
on
behalf
of
the
railway
labor
executive
association
and
its
22
member
union
group,
testified
thusly.
he
said
if
the
objectives
of
speedy,
fair
and
simplified
handling
and
some
of
contract
claims
and
grievances
in
this
industry
are
to
be
achieved,
it
would
be
done
by
reducing
to
a
minimum
rather
than
by
expanding
the
role
of
the
courts
in
this
field.
and
so
there
is
a
union
man
himself
saying
that
we,
the
union
men
are
the
ones
that
want
as
well
as
the
railways
do,
some
way
to
break
this
backlog.
and
so
in
order
to
break
the
backlog,
they
changed
the
law
to
provide
man
for
what
has
been
commonly
known
as
public
law
boards.
a
public
law
board
is
nothing
more
than
a
railroad
appointing
one
man,
the
union
appointing
one
man,
they
meet
together
and
it
can
be
done
within
30
days,
they
meet
together
and
solve
the
disputes.
if
they
can't
solve
the
dispute,
they
ask
the
mediation
board
to
appoint
a
neutral
referee
who
breaks
the
deadlock
and
they
solve
it
and
their
decision
has
the
same
force
and
affect
as
if
the
entire
board
of
adjustment
met
and
decided
the
matter.
mr.
william
h.
major
well
he
has
a
contract
that
probably
--
the
brotherhood
i
wouldn't
think
would
have
anymore
right
to
throw
him
out
of
the
job
and
then
would
the
union.
they
wouldn't
have
the
right
to
throw
him
out
of
the
job.
he
works
under
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
william
h.
major
you
mean,
he
gets
double
crossed
by
his
own
union,
is
that
what
you
are
referring
to?
well,
i
think
that
the
that
the
answer.
mr.
william
h.
major
there
is
no
prohibition
against
him
suing
his
own
union
obviously
and
secondly
i
don't
think
that
again
there
is
any
problem
in
that
regard
because
if
he
has
a
contract
right,
the
adjustment
board
can
give
him
just
the
same
relief
as
the
court
can.
mr.
william
h.
major
i
would
not
believe
they
could
mr.
justice
marshall.
what
happened
was
when
they
created
these
boards
of
adjustment
and
we
attached
as
part
of
our
brief,
a
table
of
the
report
of
the
national
mediation
board,
which
includes
the
report
of
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
and
these
divisions
are
not
geographical,
they
are
by
trials
you
understand,
the
division
that
mr.
andrews
is
in
is
substantially
current.
you
will
notice
from
the
table
that
they
have
only
taken
in
69
new
cases
last
year
and
they
disposed
off,
pardon
me,
that's
wrong,
162
cases
and
they
disposed
all
300
cases
and
they
are
substantially
current.
so,
there
is
no
reason
in
the
world,
that
mr.
andrews
could
not
get
a
very
speedy
hearing
before
his
division
of
the
adjustment
board
and
as
to
what
he
can
get
when
he
gets
there
that
obviously
is
one
of
the
key
question
is
can
he
get
the
same
thing
he
can
get
in
court.
according
to
law
of
georgia
it
is
highly
dubious
that
a
man
can
go
into
court
and
sue
for
wrongful
discharge,
while
at
the
same
time
refusing
to
take
back
employment
that
has
been
proffered
to
him
by
his
employer
because
of
the
fact
that
he
must
mitigate
his
damages
and
the
offer
of
his
job
back
simply
shows
that
he
hadn't
any
substantive
damages
in
the
future.
and
so
therefore
the
only
thing
that
he
can
get
is
a
money
judgment
for
such
amounts
of
actual
lost
wages
that
he
has
accrued.
now
that's
not
true
necessarily
before
the
adjustment
board.
before
the
adjustment
board
he
can
get
back
pay,
he
can
get
seniority
adjustments,
he
can
get
attorney's
fees
in
some
instances
and
he
can
also
get
a
reinstated
and
if
they
say
he
must
go
back
to
work
then
the
railroad
must
put
him
back
to
work
and
the
railroad
doesn't
have
any
choice.
so,
it
may
be
that
they
can
get
more
than
he
can
get
in
court.
i
don't
think
it
would
be
erroneous
to
say
that
perhaps
he
can
get
reinstated
by
a
court
action.
but,
certainly
a
speedy
remedy
is
readily
available
for
him
to
just
get
everything
that
he
can
get
in
a
court
house.
it
is
interesting
to
me
that
moore
has
been
perhaps
explained
rights
and
laws,
accepted
–
it's
--
everything
done
to
it,
but
nobody
has
yet
either
fully
affirmed
it
or
fully
overruled
it.
it
seemed
to
me
sort
of
an
embarrassing
step
child
sitting
back
there
and
we
say
that
now
in
view
of
the
history
of
the
act
there
is
no
longer
any
reason
for
moore
to
exist.
the
fundamental
reason
of
course
is
that
you
have
an
administrative
hearing
rather
than
court
hearings
in
this
area,
in
the
railway
labor
area
is
the
fact
that
in
addition
to
speed
that
you
get
uniformity
of
decisions.
as
it
now
stands
if
you
can
sue
on
these
contracts,
these
contracts
are
highly
complex,
in
that
they
are
part
written
and
part
customer
of
the
trade
as
it
were.
mr.
william
h.
major
yes
sir.
the
case
(inaudible),
is
that
your
question
mr.
justice
white?
mr.
william
h.
major
worker
and
the
railroad
together
may
enter
into
a
settlement
of
problems
--
mr.
william
h.
major
your
question
mr.
justice
white
is
broader
in
that
your
question
is
may
the
parties
in
a
situation
where
administrative
exhaustion
of
remedies
is
required
maybe
they
waive
the
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies?
mr.
william
h.
major
mr.
justice
white
i'm
not
sure
i'm
perceiving
your
question,
but
let
me
express
it
this
way.
i
would
seriously
doubt
that
under
the
act
as
it
it
presently
stand
and
under
your
decisions,
there
is
anything
to
litigate
in
the
court
house
anymore
in
connection
with
the
railroad
labor
act.
now
whether
you
could
say
the
parties
waive
the
act
and
decide
to
file
a
private
lawsuit
over
here,
i
would
think
the
court
would
question
its
own
jurisdiction
under
those
circumstances.
i
just
don't
see
any
concept
of
the
railway
labor
act
dealing
with
anything
other
than
mandatory
on
both
sides.
i
suppose
of
course,
that
you
can
do
anything
almost
by
agreement,
and
i
suppose
that
you
and
i
could
litigate
in
florida
although
neither
one
us
live
there
unless
court
has
this
part
but
--
mr.
william
h.
major
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
the
individual
himself
can
go
the
board
and
it
is
not
depended
on
his
union
taking
it
there?
mr.
william
h.
major
i
was
--
mr.
william
h.
major
i
thought
that
the
public
law
boards
were
limited
to
the
union
but
i
was
always
of
the
impression
that
the
board
itself
was
open
to
an
individual
without
his
union
representatives
and
that
my
perception
of
the
law.
mr.
william
h.
major
i
am
sure
a
public
law
board
--
mr.
william
h.
major
yes,
that's
a
special
board,
that's
a
so
called
public
law
board,
but
that's
not,
that's
where
--
approaching
one
member
and
when
i
am
approaching
other
member,
that
is
public
law
board
and
your
honor
eminently
correct
that
has
to
be
done
by
the
union
representative,
but
to
go
with
the
adjustment
board
itself
and
one
of
the
definite
question,
an
individual
can
do
without
his
union
going
with
it.
mr.
william
h.
major
well,
public
law
board
was
exactly
created
by
the
66th
amendment
for
the
purpose
of
speeding
it
up
and
they
have
speeded
it
up.
mr.
william
h.
major
we
think
exactly
he
will
get
the
speedy
treatment
because
--
by
reference
to
the
table
in
our
brief
your
honor
will
readily
see
that
the
adjustment
boards
don't
have
the
backlog
of
cases
they
had.
this
man's
division
for
instances
is
on
less
than
a
year's
time
schedule.
now,
for
the
first
division
is
where
the
backlog
always
was
is
not
that
current,
but
it
looks
like
from
computing
the
figures
that
by
june
of
next
year
they
would
be
on
about
a
year
backlog
basis,
and
that's
what
means
you
go
to
court
trial.
as
matter
of
fact
this
man
has
been
litigating
for
three
years
on
this
case,
he
hadn’t
has
trial
yet
and
so
obviously
the
public
law
boards
are
going
to
speed
up
tremendously
but
even
if
he
has
go
with
the
full
board,
he
is
much
faster
than
if
he
goes
to
court
house.
the
uniformity
of
the
decision
questions
that
i
was
speaking
about
has
to
do
with
the
fact
that
these
boards
report
their
cases
that
they
handle
and
they
therefore
have
uniformity
of
decisions.
whereas
if
the
worker
must
go
to
the
court
house
for
interpretation
of
his
contract,
the
federal
judge
sitting
there
on
the
district
level
has
a
very
awkward
task
before
him
because
in
atlanta,
georgia
for
instance,
the
only
place
where
the
reports
of
the
adjustment
board
are
on
file
and
record,
we
know
is
the
(inaudible)
of
the
railroad.
so,
if
the
federal
judge
had
one
of
these
cases
in
atlanta,
trying
to
look
for
precedent
would
be
almost
impossible
unless
he
wants
send
his
clerk
over
to
the
railroad
office.
last,
of
course
is
the
question
of
expertise
before
these
boards.
the
average
man
doesn’t
get
fired
just
willy-nilly
of
course
there
cases
of
that.
this
man
for
instance,
is
not
fired.
this
man
has
been
on
furlough
because
of
medical
reasons.
he
is
perfectly
free
to
walk
back
in
the
railroad
office
tomorrow
and
say
i
demand
my
job
and
they
said
fine,
go
to
the
doctor
and
if
he
passes
you,
you
are
back
at
work
that's
what
the
union
contract
says,
that’s
what
collective
bargaining
agreement
says.
if
the
doctor
doesn't
pass
him
then
he
is
totally
free,
if
he
thinks
he
has
been
mistreated
of
course
to
go
the
adjustment
board.
so,
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
question
of
expertise
has
something
to
do
with
it.
of
course
this
the
man
that
gets
fired
for
breaking
the
coupling,
the
engineer
if
gets
fired
for
breaking
the
coupling,
that
might
sound
to
be
a
right
stringent
thing
to
do
to
him
just
to
breaking
a
coupling.
but
what
the
railroad
knows
is
that
you
don't
get
fired
for
breaking
the
first
couplings,
you
get
fired
because
you
have
broken
the
series
of
couplings
and
it's
symptomatic
of
the
problem
that
you
will
be
a
bad
engineer
not
because
you
broke
one
coupling
or
if
you
go
through
and
broke
and
then
blow
its
whistle,
you
will
get
fired
for
that
first
time
you
get
fired
after
accumulation
of
those
kind
of
offenses.
and
when
you
speak
about
(inaudible)
derailers
and
hydraulic
couplings,
the
average
judge
doesn't
know
what
you
are
talking
about.
that
is
something
that
the
member
of
these
board
know,
they
deal
with
it
every
day
and
therefore
the
worker
gets
a
degree
of
expertise
before
these
boards
that
he
doesn't
find
at
court
house.
in
summary
therefore
we
say
that
the
problem
that
this
court
looked
at
in
the
walker
decision
has
vanished
because
of
the
fact
that
the
congress
has
amended
the
act
and
now
a
speedy
remedy
is
available.
the
inequities
that
this
court
looked
at
in
walker
case
is
gone
now
because
of
the
fact
that
the
congress
in
amending
the
act
in
1966
provided
for
an
appeal
by
either
side
instead
of
the
mere
de
novo
appeal
which
only
the
railroad
could
take
advantage
of
as
previously
the
law.
mr.
william
h.
major
exactly
the
same
as
the
railroad
is
--
mr.
william
h.
major
--
it
is
not
the
de
novo
mr.
justice
brennan.
it
is
limited
to
fraud
or
corruption
or
a
failure
of
the
board
to
confine
itself
within
the
frame
work
of
the
act.
mr.
william
h.
major
yes,
almost
exactly
on
the
question
of
arbitration
yes.
mr.
william
h.
major
the
review
is
equal
on
both
sides
and
exactly
in
the
same
manner.
and
so
we
therefore
say
that
moore
has
no
reason
to
exist.
it
probably
doesn’t
need
to
be
reversed
or
overruled
for
reason
that
new
situations
have
taken
place
within
the
act
that
give
it
a
new
day,
but
it
necessarily
it
means
that
moore
no
longer
is
the
law
and
that
the
administrative
remedy
provided
by
congress
is
correct
route
for
the
employee
to
go.
mr.
william
h.
major
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
somehow
get
the
feeling
that
if
you
argue
in
favor
of
a
court
trial,
that
means
you
are
for
the
working
man
and
if
you
argue
in
favor
of
administrative
remedies,
that
means
you
are
for
the
railroad.
and
i
don't
think
that's
right
and
i
don't
think
it
is
reflected
in
the
congressional
history
of
this
act,
and
i
don't
think
it
is
now
the
present
thinking
of
labor
and
the
railroad
that,
that
is
correct.
i
submit
that
the
railway
labor
act
was
an
act
sought
by
both
the
unions
and
the
owners
of
the
railroad.
that
in
those
days
in
1926
when
the
act
came
into
being,
there
was
a
feeling
of
voluntariness
in
the
eyes
of
the
congress
that
they
could
simply
prod
one
side
and
the
other
side
by
means
of
the
railway
labor
act
and
achieve
the
desired
results.
and
that
is
what
is
done
in
the
area
of
major
disputes,
those
disputes
arising
out
of
giving
the
contract
to
start
off
with,
that's
where
the
union
has
a
right
to
strike
when
the
prodding
doesn't
work,
although
the
railroad
has
a
right
to
lock
out
and
that
is
on
a
voluntary
basis.
on
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
in
minor
disputes
where
you
have
the
interpretation
or
application
of
contracts;
both
the
union
and
the
railroad
have
been
in
favor
of
that
administrative
remedy.
now
i
don't
know
how
the
case
of
moore
ever
came
to
be
in
view
of
the
legislative
history
because
if
you
look
back
in
the
1934
amendments
which
took
place
of
course
shortly
after
the
passage
of
the
act,
when
they
found
that
the
minor
dispute
area
wasn't
working
because
of
the
fact
that
it
was
voluntary,
the
union
has
voluntarily
appointed
the
board
of
adjustment
members
and
the
railroad
voluntarily
appointed
their
members
and
neither
side
would
do
it,
and
they
found
that
wasn't
working.
and
both
the
unions
and
the
railroads
came
back
to
the
congress
and
in
effect
said,
it's
not
working
and
we
have
got
to
do
something
about
the
area
of
minor
disputes.
and
bear
in
mind
of
course
that
the
word
minor
dispute
is
a
word
of
art
that
the
framers
of
the
act
used
not
because
they
thought
that
the
disputes
were
minor,
but
to
distinguish
them
from
strike
issues,
they
used
that
word
of
art.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
when
the
amendment
was
in
the
committee,
it
was
proposed
by
the
federal
court
in
the
area
of
transportation,
an
office
that
no
longer
in
existence
but
he
said
the
existence
of
mandatory
boards
of
adjustment
would
create
nice
enough
and
more
consistent
in
the
interpretation
and
application
of
contracts.
mr.
william
h.
major
and
in
those
committee
hearings,
a
member
named
george
m.
harrison,
who
probably
had
as
many
credentials
as
a
union
may
have,
he
was
president
of
the
brotherhood
of
railway
and
steamship
clerks,
freight
handlers,
express
and
station
employees
and
appeared
as
chairman
of
the
legislative
committee
of
the
railway
labor
association,
he
said
this
in
substance.
he
said,
these
areas
of
minor
disputes
that
we
are
looking
at
in
the
form
of
the
compulsory
adjustment
board,
they
may
very
well
involve
a
man's
seniority,
a
man's
pay
for
amount
of
work
done,
his
promotion
rights
and
then
i
quote
him
as
saying,
it
may
very
well
concern
the
separation
of
the
employee
from
the
service,
whether
or
not
he
has
been
unjustly
discharged.
so
as
early
as
1934
in
the
congressional
hearings,
the
union
representatives
were
talking
about
mandatory
boards
of
adjustment
to
take
care
of
the
disputes
between
the
railroad
and
the
working
man
over
matters
of
promotions,
seniority,
rates
of
pay,
including
discharge.
and
then
this
court
came
along
and
decided
moore
in-spite
of
that
legislative
history.
even
more
remarkable
is
the
way
in
which
moore
was
decided.
you
understand
the
railway
labor
act
in
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
was
and
(inaudible)
in
moore.
it
wasn't
even
briefed
by
the
winning
side
as
a
matter
of
fact.
moore
came
upon
then
novel
erie
question.
moore
was
in
the
state
court
and
it
was
a
statue
of
limitation
questions
involved,
whether
a
one-year
statute
controlled
as
moore's
contract
or
the
six-year
written
contract
with
the
union
and
it
got
to
this
court
on
the
thinking
that
the
state
law
controlled.
as
a
matter
of
fact
later
on
in
amplifying
moore
and
distinguishing
moore
in
the
case
of
koppal,
this
court
held,
“you
must
exhaust
your
administrative
remedies
in
your
state
if
your
state
requires
exhaustive
remedies,
but
you
need
not
if
your
state
does
not
require
the
exhaustion
of
remedies.”
so,
you
have
moore
on
one
hand
and
koppal
on
the
other
hand,
one
of
them
saying
that
you
had
to
go
the
adjustment
board,
the
other
one
saying
it
didn't
depend
on
the
act
and
the
way
you
happen
to
be
fired,
as
it
were.
however
this
court
i
think
has
now
fully
and
finally
solved
the
question
of
whether
state
law
or
federal
law
applies.
i
think
in
the
case
of
textile
mills
versus
lincoln
--
textile
workers
versus
lincoln
mills,
decided
by
this
court
in
1957
and
also
the
case
of
international
associates
of
machinists
against
central
airlines,
this
court
has
once
and
forever
solved
the
problem
by
saying
that
anything
under
the
railway
labor
act
involving
minor
disputes
is
controlled
by
federal
law.
therefore,
when
we
say
that
this
man
who
has
been
discharged
doesn't
have
a
remedy
that's
available
to
the
middle
man,
as
he
has
expressed,
it's
contrary
to
the
thinking
that
the
unions
and
to
the
thinking
of
the
framers
of
the
bill
as
it
came
through
the
congress
and
it's
contrary
really
to
the
thinking
of
this
court.
it
is
true
that
--
mr.
william
h.
major
he
does
indeed,
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
william
h.
major
if
my
understanding
of
the
act
is
correct,
he
has
an
absolute
right
to
go
himself.
now,
where
he
may
not
be
able
to
go
himself
is
to
a
public
law
board.
mr.
william
h.
major
it
is
my
impression
that
the
66th
amendment
of
the
act
--
mr.
william
h.
major
reading
'j'
of
this
section,
it
says
parties
maybe
heard
even
in
person
by
council
or
by
other
representative
as
they
may
respectively
elect
and
i
would
assume
that
means
if
a
party
can
be
heard
in
person,
a
party
means
an
individual
rather
than
the
union,
i
would
guess.
mr.
william
h.
major
mr.
justice
douglas,
if
that
is
true
then
my
conception
of
the
railway
labor
act
or
my
dispute
is
erroneous
because
it
was
my
definite
impression
that
not
only
could
it
be
done,
but
it
was
being
done
daily
before
the
adjustment
board.
mr.
william
h.
major
that
is
always
of
course
a
possibility
mr.
justice
douglas.
in
that
connection
of
course
the
criticism
that
this
court
found
of
the
whole
situation
as
assumed
by
walker
against
the
southern
railroad
was
one
of
delay
and
another
of
inequity.
the
delay
that
has
been
referred
to
and
which
is
referred
to
in
that
decision
is
the
delay
of
adjustment
board.
the
first
division,
for
instance
had
a
delay
of
at
that
time
was
seven-and-a-half
years.
with
that
in
mind
the
congress
in
1966
attempted
to
remedy
the
situation
on
the
question
of
delay
and
again
it
is
quite
remarkable
in
the
committee
hearings
just
what
happened.
in
those
committee
hearings
there
was
days
and
days
of
hearings
and
so
there
is
all
kind
of
material
in
there,
but
the
remarkable
testimony
of
mr.
jesse
clark
who
identified
himself
as
president
of
brotherhood
of
signalmen
on
behalf
of
the
railway
labor
executive
association
and
its
22
member
union
group,
testified
thusly.
he
said
if
the
objectives
of
speedy,
fair
and
simplified
handling
and
some
of
contract
claims
and
grievances
in
this
industry
are
to
be
achieved,
it
would
be
done
by
reducing
to
a
minimum
rather
than
by
expanding
the
role
of
the
courts
in
this
field.
and
so
there
is
a
union
man
himself
saying
that
we,
the
union
men
are
the
ones
that
want
as
well
as
the
railways
do,
some
way
to
break
this
backlog.
and
so
in
order
to
break
the
backlog,
they
changed
the
law
to
provide
man
for
what
has
been
commonly
known
as
public
law
boards.
a
public
law
board
is
nothing
more
than
a
railroad
appointing
one
man,
the
union
appointing
one
man,
they
meet
together
and
it
can
be
done
within
30
days,
they
meet
together
and
solve
the
disputes.
if
they
can't
solve
the
dispute,
they
ask
the
mediation
board
to
appoint
a
neutral
referee
who
breaks
the
deadlock
and
they
solve
it
and
their
decision
has
the
same
force
and
affect
as
if
the
entire
board
of
adjustment
met
and
decided
the
matter.
mr.
william
h.
major
well
he
has
a
contract
that
probably
--
the
brotherhood
i
wouldn't
think
would
have
anymore
right
to
throw
him
out
of
the
job
and
then
would
the
union.
they
wouldn't
have
the
right
to
throw
him
out
of
the
job.
he
works
under
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
william
h.
major
you
mean,
he
gets
double
crossed
by
his
own
union,
is
that
what
you
are
referring
to?
well,
i
think
that
the
that
the
answer.
mr.
william
h.
major
there
is
no
prohibition
against
him
suing
his
own
union
obviously
and
secondly
i
don't
think
that
again
there
is
any
problem
in
that
regard
because
if
he
has
a
contract
right,
the
adjustment
board
can
give
him
just
the
same
relief
as
the
court
can.
mr.
william
h.
major
i
would
not
believe
they
could
mr.
justice
marshall.
what
happened
was
when
they
created
these
boards
of
adjustment
and
we
attached
as
part
of
our
brief,
a
table
of
the
report
of
the
national
mediation
board,
which
includes
the
report
of
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
and
these
divisions
are
not
geographical,
they
are
by
trials
you
understand,
the
division
that
mr.
andrews
is
in
is
substantially
current.
you
will
notice
from
the
table
that
they
have
only
taken
in
69
new
cases
last
year
and
they
disposed
off,
pardon
me,
that's
wrong,
162
cases
and
they
disposed
all
300
cases
and
they
are
substantially
current.
so,
there
is
no
reason
in
the
world,
that
mr.
andrews
could
not
get
a
very
speedy
hearing
before
his
division
of
the
adjustment
board
and
as
to
what
he
can
get
when
he
gets
there
that
obviously
is
one
of
the
key
question
is
can
he
get
the
same
thing
he
can
get
in
court.
according
to
law
of
georgia
it
is
highly
dubious
that
a
man
can
go
into
court
and
sue
for
wrongful
discharge,
while
at
the
same
time
refusing
to
take
back
employment
that
has
been
proffered
to
him
by
his
employer
because
of
the
fact
that
he
must
mitigate
his
damages
and
the
offer
of
his
job
back
simply
shows
that
he
hadn't
any
substantive
damages
in
the
future.
and
so
therefore
the
only
thing
that
he
can
get
is
a
money
judgment
for
such
amounts
of
actual
lost
wages
that
he
has
accrued.
now
that's
not
true
necessarily
before
the
adjustment
board.
before
the
adjustment
board
he
can
get
back
pay,
he
can
get
seniority
adjustments,
he
can
get
attorney's
fees
in
some
instances
and
he
can
also
get
a
reinstated
and
if
they
say
he
must
go
back
to
work
then
the
railroad
must
put
him
back
to
work
and
the
railroad
doesn't
have
any
choice.
so,
it
may
be
that
they
can
get
more
than
he
can
get
in
court.
i
don't
think
it
would
be
erroneous
to
say
that
perhaps
he
can
get
reinstated
by
a
court
action.
but,
certainly
a
speedy
remedy
is
readily
available
for
him
to
just
get
everything
that
he
can
get
in
a
court
house.
it
is
interesting
to
me
that
moore
has
been
perhaps
explained
rights
and
laws,
accepted
–
it's
--
everything
done
to
it,
but
nobody
has
yet
either
fully
affirmed
it
or
fully
overruled
it.
it
seemed
to
me
sort
of
an
embarrassing
step
child
sitting
back
there
and
we
say
that
now
in
view
of
the
history
of
the
act
there
is
no
longer
any
reason
for
moore
to
exist.
the
fundamental
reason
of
course
is
that
you
have
an
administrative
hearing
rather
than
court
hearings
in
this
area,
in
the
railway
labor
area
is
the
fact
that
in
addition
to
speed
that
you
get
uniformity
of
decisions.
as
it
now
stands
if
you
can
sue
on
these
contracts,
these
contracts
are
highly
complex,
in
that
they
are
part
written
and
part
customer
of
the
trade
as
it
were.
mr.
william
h.
major
yes
sir.
the
case
(inaudible),
is
that
your
question
mr.
justice
white?
mr.
william
h.
major
worker
and
the
railroad
together
may
enter
into
a
settlement
of
problems
--
mr.
william
h.
major
your
question
mr.
justice
white
is
broader
in
that
your
question
is
may
the
parties
in
a
situation
where
administrative
exhaustion
of
remedies
is
required
maybe
they
waive
the
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies?
mr.
william
h.
major
mr.
justice
white
i'm
not
sure
i'm
perceiving
your
question,
but
let
me
express
it
this
way.
i
would
seriously
doubt
that
under
the
act
as
it
it
presently
stand
and
under
your
decisions,
there
is
anything
to
litigate
in
the
court
house
anymore
in
connection
with
the
railroad
labor
act.
now
whether
you
could
say
the
parties
waive
the
act
and
decide
to
file
a
private
lawsuit
over
here,
i
would
think
the
court
would
question
its
own
jurisdiction
under
those
circumstances.
i
just
don't
see
any
concept
of
the
railway
labor
act
dealing
with
anything
other
than
mandatory
on
both
sides.
i
suppose
of
course,
that
you
can
do
anything
almost
by
agreement,
and
i
suppose
that
you
and
i
could
litigate
in
florida
although
neither
one
us
live
there
unless
court
has
this
part
but
--
mr.
william
h.
major
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
the
individual
himself
can
go
the
board
and
it
is
not
depended
on
his
union
taking
it
there?
mr.
william
h.
major
i
was
--
mr.
william
h.
major
i
thought
that
the
public
law
boards
were
limited
to
the
union
but
i
was
always
of
the
impression
that
the
board
itself
was
open
to
an
individual
without
his
union
representatives
and
that
my
perception
of
the
law.
mr.
william
h.
major
i
am
sure
a
public
law
board
--
mr.
william
h.
major
yes,
that's
a
special
board,
that's
a
so
called
public
law
board,
but
that's
not,
that's
where
--
approaching
one
member
and
when
i
am
approaching
other
member,
that
is
public
law
board
and
your
honor
eminently
correct
that
has
to
be
done
by
the
union
representative,
but
to
go
with
the
adjustment
board
itself
and
one
of
the
definite
question,
an
individual
can
do
without
his
union
going
with
it.
mr.
william
h.
major
well,
public
law
board
was
exactly
created
by
the
66th
amendment
for
the
purpose
of
speeding
it
up
and
they
have
speeded
it
up.
mr.
william
h.
major
we
think
exactly
he
will
get
the
speedy
treatment
because
--
by
reference
to
the
table
in
our
brief
your
honor
will
readily
see
that
the
adjustment
boards
don't
have
the
backlog
of
cases
they
had.
this
man's
division
for
instances
is
on
less
than
a
year's
time
schedule.
now,
for
the
first
division
is
where
the
backlog
always
was
is
not
that
current,
but
it
looks
like
from
computing
the
figures
that
by
june
of
next
year
they
would
be
on
about
a
year
backlog
basis,
and
that's
what
means
you
go
to
court
trial.
as
matter
of
fact
this
man
has
been
litigating
for
three
years
on
this
case,
he
hadn’t
has
trial
yet
and
so
obviously
the
public
law
boards
are
going
to
speed
up
tremendously
but
even
if
he
has
go
with
the
full
board,
he
is
much
faster
than
if
he
goes
to
court
house.
the
uniformity
of
the
decision
questions
that
i
was
speaking
about
has
to
do
with
the
fact
that
these
boards
report
their
cases
that
they
handle
and
they
therefore
have
uniformity
of
decisions.
whereas
if
the
worker
must
go
to
the
court
house
for
interpretation
of
his
contract,
the
federal
judge
sitting
there
on
the
district
level
has
a
very
awkward
task
before
him
because
in
atlanta,
georgia
for
instance,
the
only
place
where
the
reports
of
the
adjustment
board
are
on
file
and
record,
we
know
is
the
(inaudible)
of
the
railroad.
so,
if
the
federal
judge
had
one
of
these
cases
in
atlanta,
trying
to
look
for
precedent
would
be
almost
impossible
unless
he
wants
send
his
clerk
over
to
the
railroad
office.
last,
of
course
is
the
question
of
expertise
before
these
boards.
the
average
man
doesn’t
get
fired
just
willy-nilly
of
course
there
cases
of
that.
this
man
for
instance,
is
not
fired.
this
man
has
been
on
furlough
because
of
medical
reasons.
he
is
perfectly
free
to
walk
back
in
the
railroad
office
tomorrow
and
say
i
demand
my
job
and
they
said
fine,
go
to
the
doctor
and
if
he
passes
you,
you
are
back
at
work
that's
what
the
union
contract
says,
that’s
what
collective
bargaining
agreement
says.
if
the
doctor
doesn't
pass
him
then
he
is
totally
free,
if
he
thinks
he
has
been
mistreated
of
course
to
go
the
adjustment
board.
so,
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
question
of
expertise
has
something
to
do
with
it.
of
course
this
the
man
that
gets
fired
for
breaking
the
coupling,
the
engineer
if
gets
fired
for
breaking
the
coupling,
that
might
sound
to
be
a
right
stringent
thing
to
do
to
him
just
to
breaking
a
coupling.
but
what
the
railroad
knows
is
that
you
don't
get
fired
for
breaking
the
first
couplings,
you
get
fired
because
you
have
broken
the
series
of
couplings
and
it's
symptomatic
of
the
problem
that
you
will
be
a
bad
engineer
not
because
you
broke
one
coupling
or
if
you
go
through
and
broke
and
then
blow
its
whistle,
you
will
get
fired
for
that
first
time
you
get
fired
after
accumulation
of
those
kind
of
offenses.
and
when
you
speak
about
(inaudible)
derailers
and
hydraulic
couplings,
the
average
judge
doesn't
know
what
you
are
talking
about.
that
is
something
that
the
member
of
these
board
know,
they
deal
with
it
every
day
and
therefore
the
worker
gets
a
degree
of
expertise
before
these
boards
that
he
doesn't
find
at
court
house.
in
summary
therefore
we
say
that
the
problem
that
this
court
looked
at
in
the
walker
decision
has
vanished
because
of
the
fact
that
the
congress
has
amended
the
act
and
now
a
speedy
remedy
is
available.
the
inequities
that
this
court
looked
at
in
walker
case
is
gone
now
because
of
the
fact
that
the
congress
in
amending
the
act
in
1966
provided
for
an
appeal
by
either
side
instead
of
the
mere
de
novo
appeal
which
only
the
railroad
could
take
advantage
of
as
previously
the
law.
mr.
william
h.
major
exactly
the
same
as
the
railroad
is
--
mr.
william
h.
major
--
it
is
not
the
de
novo
mr.
justice
brennan.
it
is
limited
to
fraud
or
corruption
or
a
failure
of
the
board
to
confine
itself
within
the
frame
work
of
the
act.
mr.
william
h.
major
yes,
almost
exactly
on
the
question
of
arbitration
yes.
mr.
william
h.
major
the
review
is
equal
on
both
sides
and
exactly
in
the
same
manner.
and
so
we
therefore
say
that
moore
has
no
reason
to
exist.
it
probably
doesn’t
need
to
be
reversed
or
overruled
for
reason
that
new
situations
have
taken
place
within
the
act
that
give
it
a
new
day,
but
it
necessarily
it
means
that
moore
no
longer
is
the
law
and
that
the
administrative
remedy
provided
by
congress
is
correct
route
for
the
employee
to
go.
