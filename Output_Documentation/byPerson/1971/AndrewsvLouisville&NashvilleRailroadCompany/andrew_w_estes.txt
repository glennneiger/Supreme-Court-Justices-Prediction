mr.
andrew
w.
estes
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
thomas
l.
andrews
who
used
to
be
a
railroad
man.
one
day
mr.
andrews
had
an
automobile
accident,
which
had
nothing
to
with
his
employment
where
he
was
injured
necessitating
a
medical
furlough
which
he
was
duly
given.
in
due
time
he
regained
his
health
and
attempted
to
return
to
work.
when
he
got
back,
tried
to
go
to
work,
he
found
that
he
was
still
on
medical
furlough
and
even
with
the
doctor'
certificate
he
was
not
permitted
to
work,
and
of
course
he
was
not
paid
either.
the
railroad,
of
course,
in
its
defensive
pleadings
contended
that
he
was
neither
a
fish
nor
a
fowl,
that
he
was
not
employed
and
he
was
not
discharged.
mr.
andrews
in
his
complaint,
originally
in
the
state
court,
then
removed
to
federal
district
court
contends
that
these
acts
and
other
acts
amount
to
a
common
law
of
wrongful
discharge
which
the
state
of
georgia
recognizes
as
a
common
law
action.
now
what
we
have
today
is
really
a
jurisdictional
question
and
it's
to
determine
whether
or
not
courts
have
jurisdiction
over
a
common
law
wrongful
discharge
action
arising
out
of
a
discharge
of
a
union
railroad
employee
or
whether
the
employee
must,
and
i
use
the
term
exhaust
loosely
of
the
moment,
exhaust
his
administrative
remedies.
i
think
i
can
show
later
that
we
no
longer
have
an
exhaustion
of
the
administrative
remedies,
rather
it
amounts
to
an
election
of
administrative
remedies.
the
court
has
undoubtedly
noticed
how
brief
the
petitioner's
brief
is,
because
we
have
a
very
simple
contention.
we
rely
primarily,
almost
solely
on
the
moore
versus
central
illinois
railroad
company
decided
by
this
court
in
1940.
the
rationale
in
that
case
of
course
was
that
a
railroad
union
employee
could
elect
either
to
pursue
his
administrative
remedies
or
could
sue
in
the
court
of
law
for
a
common
wrongful
discharge,
and
we
rely
squarely
on
that
case.
mr.
moore
was
fired
by
the
illinois
central
railroad
because
he
had
the
audacity
to
sue
them
on
an
fela
case,
should
understand
that
as
general
--
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
no,
your
honor,
he
does
not.
he
wants
to
sue
them
for
damages.
the
board
could,
if
he
made
his
election
and
i
don't
call
that
exhaustion,
but
if
he
made
his
election,
the
board
could
reinstate
him,
grant
him
back
pay,
and
give
him
his
job.
he
doesn't
want
that.
he
wants
to
sue
for
damages.
this
court
has
said,
by
the
way,
on
numerous
occasions
and
i
will
quote
in
the
slocum
case,
a
common
law
statutory
action
for
wrongful
discharge
differs
from
any
remedy
that
board
has
power
to
provide
and
does
not
involve
questions
of
future
relations
between
the
railroad
and
other
employees.
of
course,
this
general
philosophy
was
stated
very
well
by
mr.
justice
blackmun
in
the
arguelles
case
which
i've
cited
not,
by
the
way,
as
authority
for
this
case,
but
because
of
the
language
in
that,
i
would
like
to
get
to
it
a
minute.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
i
think
there
would
be
several
things,
sir,
mr.
justice
brennan.
one,
of
course
there
would
be
the
difference
between
the
wages
that
he
would
have
made
with
railroad
and
wages
he
has
in
the
past.
also,
prospectively
--
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
that's
right,
your
honor,
under
a
common
law
theory.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
that's
right.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
that's
right,
it
would
be
post
factor
as
well.
although,
i
believe
in
rare
instances
the
board
can,
i
believe
can
award
attorneys
fees.
i
think
[voice
overlap]
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
that's
right
mr.
justice
brennan,
plus
reinstatement
working
back
at
the
railroad.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
well,
general
damages
being,
the
measure
of
damages,
of
course,
we
would
look
to
the
current
trend,
see
what
his
wages
would
have
been
had
he
been
employed,
and
what
wages
he
has
earned,
the
difference
being
the
measure
of
damages
that
would
be
retrospective
and
in
post
factor,
of
course
it
would
be
a
jury
question
to
determine
what
his
future
damages
might
be.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
mr.
justice
white,
i
certainly
do,
i
believe.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
yes
sir,
mr.
justice
white,
i
believe
that
could
be
done.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
georgia
recognizes
a
doctrine
known
as
constructive
service,
where
a
man
makes
himself
available
for
work
under
his
employment
contract
he
can
remain
available
and
say
i
am
ready
to
work
and
you
have
to
pay
me.
now
of
course
if
they
offer
--
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
that's
a
difficult
question,
i
am
not
sure
is
decided
by
georgia
law.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
that's
a
very
difficult
question.
i
think
it's
not
answered
by
georgia
law.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
but
i
would
nonetheless,
going
to
the
extent
i
don't
think
the
acts
can
cut
both
ways.
i
don't
think
it
--
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
yes
sir.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
that's
right.
whatever
the
state
law
provides
may
vary
from
state
to
state
as
well.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
well,
to
start
with
mr.
justice
white,
i
am
not
sure
of
this.
i
am
not
sure
if
this
is
a
breach
of
contract
case
anyway.
there
is
some
question
about
that.
the
georgia
courts
have
had
numerous
cases
on
the
wrongful
discharge
that
has
never
been
a
holding
that
this
is
a
matter
in
breach
of
contract.
assuming
it
was
for
a
moment,
that
is
what
mr.
moore
sued
for
breach
of
contract.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
excuse
me?
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
yes,
mr.
justice
white,
he
does.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
yes,
mr.
justice
white,
it
does,
but
nonetheless
i
am
not
sure
that,
that
makes
it
an
action
in
contract,
that
is
to
say
an
action
x
contract
--
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
equivalent
or
not
there
was
justification
under
the
contract
--
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
i
think
its
state
law
your
honor,
under
the
transcontinental
&
western
airlines
versus
koppal.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
they
are
mooted
--
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
yes,
your
honor,
there
is
one
case,
it's
very
critical.
in
fact
there
are
two
cases,
i
would
like
to
discuss
in
this
connection.
the
first
is
union
pacific
railroad
company
versus
price,
i
will
call
it
price
case.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
i
believe
so.
this
is
a
case
that
really
destroys
your
exhaustion
of
remedies
and
makes
it
an
election
of
remedies
because
here
mr.
price
was
fired.
i
think
he
also
sued
the
railroad
under
fela
action.
they
fired
him
because
of
it.
he
pursued
his
administrative
remedy.
the
adjustment
board
found
that
he
had
been
properly
discharged.
so
he
said,
okay,
i
have
exhausted
my
administrative
remedies,
i
will
go
into
my
court
and
of
course
holding
of
this
court
in
that
case
was
that
you
can't
re-litigate
similar
issues.
so,
we
can
forget
about
exhausting
of
administrative
remedies
and
i
think
we
should
from
now
on
be
discussing
election
of
remedies.
no
case
has
really
undermined
the
moore
decision
as
the
railroad
contends.
even
the
case
of
roy
walker
versus
southern
railway,
that's
a
real
bugaboo
case
unfortunately
because
it
set
some
real
misapplications
to
stop
while
its
not
a
wrongful
discharge
type
case
to
begin
with
and
should
not
fit
within
the
particular
more
exclusion
and
should
not
be
applied
to
it.
what
it
really
was
a
was
a
competition
in
time
case.
mr.
roy
walker
also
took
sick
leave,
he
gave
the
railroad
notice
that
he
was
ill.
the
railroad
contended
that
he
had
given
it
too
late
within
30
days
required
by
the
contract.
roy
walker
contended
he
had
given
it
in
time.
the
question
really
that
was
not
wrongful
discharge
but
was
a
case
whether
or
not
he
had
given
this
notice
in
time.
so
it
was
time
confrontation
case.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
i
think
it
is
now
because
of
the
price
case
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
i
think
that's
a
question
to
be
determined
by
georgia
law
and
by
a
jury,
your
honor.
i
agree
that
i
think
--
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
it
may
be
a
mis-question
of
law,
in
fact
depending
on
on
whether
or
not
the
offer
is
believable.
for
instance,
mr.
andrews
in
this
case
may
very
well
and
i
would
state
in
my
place,
probably
will
on
the
trial
of
the
case
show
by
evidence
that
his
wrongful
discharge
was
occasioned
by
things
other
than
his
illness
and
that
the
illness
was
a
mere
charade,
a
mere
sham
and
there
are
other
reasons
the
railroad
wants
to
dump
him,
and
that
the
offer
is
not
a
real
genuine
or
bona
fide
offer
but
is
a
way
to
mitigate
damages.
much
is
attached
in
an
fela
case
where
the
railroad
argues
to
the
jury,
well,
he
has
done
this
wonderful
job,
ironies
and
what
not,
their
total
verdict
and
then
he
gets
fired.
so,
i
think
it
maybe
a
mixed
question
of
law
in
fact
and
i
think
it
could
be
properly
submitted
to
a
jury
predicated
on
state
law.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
no,
no.
mr.
justice
brennan,
as
matter
of
fact
i
think
these
are
key
questions,
because
of
the
collateral
cases
surrounding
the
original
moore
decision,
that
it
confuses
the
situation
so
badly.
as
i
first
stated
--
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
if
you
would
overrule
moore
--
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
not
only
would
mr.
andrews
have
to
go
to
the
adjustment
board,
mr.
justice
brennan,
you
would
forever
slam
the
court
house
door
in
any
other
claim
--
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
well,
yes
mr.
justice
brennan
that
was
true
with
several
notable
exceptions.
of
course
the
foundation
of
the
roy
walker
case,
it's
our
contention
that
it
is
not
really
well
laid.
i
think
as
mr.
justice
stewart
and
mr.
justice
white
pointed
out,
you
can't
really
make
a
jurisdictional
determination
on
how
well
or
fully
railroad
adjustment
board
is
doing.
it
would
be
patently
discriminatory,
what
if
some
poor
fellow
up
in
new
york
who's
board
is
way
behind
because
they
have
a
lot
of
claims.
so,
he
gets
to
sue
and
the
guy
in
southern
california
where
they
don't
have
many
claims,
where
he
has
to
go
through
the
board.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
speed
up
remedies
--
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan,
it
has
happened.
about
50%
of
collective
decisions
--
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
well
even
less,
say
four
years
or
in
some
places
one-and-a-half
years.
they
vary,
but
of
course
you
can
have
a
variable
jurisdiction
throughout
the
country
depending
on
how
the
board
is
doing.
besides
that,
what
if
the
board
slow
down
five
years
now,
going
to
let
more
roy
walker
slip
through.
well,
i
think
they
couldn't
very
well
do
that
either,
that
would
be
discriminatory.
it
really
shouldn't
be
predicated
though
on
how
well
the
board
is
doing.
it's
a
matter
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
well,
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
take
the
position
that
a
judicial
review
is
not
a
review
they
now
--
i
maybe
mistaken
but
i
think
that
the
findings
in
fact
[voice
overlap]
the
case
--
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
perhaps
you
did
mr.
justice
--
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
it's
my
understanding
that
mr.
price
would
not
be
permitted
to
re-litigate
issues
already
determined
and
it
would
be
petitioner's
contention,
that
would
be
basically
the
same
as
now
that
when
a
matter
once
decided
would
not
be
re-litigated
on
factual
finding.
there
is
another
interesting
thing
about
the
1966
amendments
which
i
respectfully
submit
was
totally
overlooked
by
the
court
in
the
roy
walker
case
which
is
that
the
1966
amendments
should
be
a
clear
designation
of
legislative
intent
in
this
regard.
that
is
to
say,
sweeping
changes
were
made
and
some
real
positive
things
were
done
by
the
legislature
to
speed
up
the
remedies,
all
sort
of
balance
and
add
a
little
bit
too,
i
think.
but
in
all
of
the
committee
reports
and
in
all
of
the
legislative
committee
meetings
and
the
history
of
the
legislature
there,
and
in
the
legislation
itself,
there
is
not
one
single
word,
not
one
iota
of
change
as
to
the
scope
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
board,
nor
the
limitation
of
the
federal
or
state
courts
in
these
matters.
i
don't
know
where
you
can
get
a
much
clearer
mandate
in
a
legislature.
they
had
their
opportunity.
it
was
a
big
crisis.
it
was
a
big
issue.
=
something
had
to
be
done.
they
did
some
procedural
things
and
they
dare
not
touch
the
authority
or
the
scope
of
the
jurisdiction
--
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
this
is
a
perfect
opportunity
to
end
this
legal
battle
or
the
chipping
away
and
the
pecking
away
of
moore
with
the
koppal
decision.
there
is
another
area,
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
which
is
the
real
distinguishing
characteristic
between
what
i
call
moore
type
cases,
that
is
to
say
a
purely
wrongful
discharge
case
and
a
slocum
type
case
or
charlie
maddox
type
case,
that's
maddox
versus
republic
steel
company.
these
are
cases
where
someone,
and
by
the
way
the
slocum
type
case,
mr.
slocum
was
the
chairman
of
the
railroad
union,
two
unions
were
in
dispute
as
to
who
had
jurisdiction
over
certain
area
of
work.
the
railroad
attempted
to
file
in
state
court
an
action
for
a
declaratory
judgment
to
make
a
determination
and
of
course,
they
were
required
to
go
by
the
arbitration
method.
this
was
completely
distinguished
in
the
slocum
case
from
the
moore
type
case
where
this
is
an
ex-employee
who
is
not
involved
in
rights
by
the
railroad
employees,
and
he
is
still
in
the
railroad
just
like
their
(inaudible).
the
walker
case
is
like
a
slocum
case.
charlie
maddox's
case
was
a
case
where
charlie
maddox
had
been
properly
laid
off
and
was
suing
only
for
severed
claim
in
the
contract.
now
i
said
that
i
would
come
to
the
arguelles
case.
i
want
to
mention
it
just
very
briefly
because
i
think
that
can
straighten
out
some
also
very
unfortunate
language
that
came
out
of
the
roy
walker
case,
and
that
was
the
language
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
instant
case
used,
even
though
they
conceded
that
although
the
law
was
on
my
side
nonetheless
a
ruling
against
me
was
this,
the
overruling
act
has
also
held
that
is
about
a
certain
as
a
season,
changing
as
the
season
coming
from
mr
justice
black
in
that
case.
mr.
justice
black,
in
the
arguelles
case
made
a
very
strong,
very
fine
statement
and
i
think
it
reflects
the
feeling
of
this
court,
the
thrust
of
this
court
and
its
perseverance
and
continue
to
try
to
maintain
the
courthouse
door
is
open
to
the
public,
to
the
little
man,
where
mr.
justice
black
and
this
was
consideration,
by
the
way
arguelles
case
was
a
seaman
suing
under
a
statutory
right
to
elect.
the
court
says,
in
arguelles
the
legislature
clearly
preserved
his
right
to
sue.
in
the
section
301,
in
which
the
case
has
been,
section
301
the
legislature
has
not
clearly
taken
it
away,
and
it
would
be
highly
precipitous
for
this
court
or
any
court,
to
remove
the
man's
right
to
litigate
a
wrongful
discharge,
a
common
law
action
in
a
court
without
specific
legislative
action
and
no
clear
reflection
of
any
legislative
intent
toward
that
direction
in
any
event.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
could
he
get
a
reinstatement
in
court?
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
so,
i
think
--
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
well,
i
don't
believe
you
can
force
someone
to
be
employed
somewhere.
i
don't
believe
the
railroad
to
be
forced
to
make
him,
he
was
an
electrician,
so
say,
i
don't
believe
that
you
can
force
a
railroad
to
let
him
put
together
their
switch
box,
they
may
have
to
pay
him,
may
have
to
give
him
damages,
but
i
don't
believe
that
they
have
got
to
employ.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
yes,
your
honor,
it
does
readily.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
no,
your
honor,
i
think
damages,
general
damages
for
common
law
wrong
are
totally
different
damages
and
they
can't
--
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
well,
perhaps,
a
court
could.
i
don't
believe
the
railroad
or
thomas
l.
andrews
want
reinstatement
and
i
think
the
evidence
indicates
--
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
mr.
justice
white,
in
all
probability
a
court
could
tell
the
railroad
either
it
had
to
hire
him
or
--
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
no.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
that's
never
been
litigated
to
my
knowledge,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
but
that
would
be
my
position,
yes.
because
you
can't
make
the
railroad
put
someone
in
their
machine
shop
monkeying
around
with
their
equipment
that
they
don't
want.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
if
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
your
honor
it
is
my
understanding
that
he
cannot,
but
he
can
sue
his
railroads
for
failure
to
do
it,
i
believe
there
is
supreme
court
case
on
this.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
i
think
the
employee
once
he
is
fired,
once
he
is
out
in
the
court,
i
believe
he
can
sue
the
union
for
its
failure
to
adequately
represent
him
and
join
--
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
mr.
justice
brennan
it’s
my
impression
is
that
he
cannot
go
himself,
representing
himself
or
through
his
counsel
representing
him.
this
is
my
impression
i
am
no
libel...
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
what
this
case
is
all
about
your
honor
--
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
may
it
please
court,
we
have
taken
the
position
that
he
cannot.
most
particularly
in
an
interesting
case
like
the
case
at
bar.
i
hadn’t
intended
it
to
bring
this
out.
there
is
no
evidence
by
the
way,
there
has
been
no
discovery
in
the
case,
and
it
is
almost
pure
law
question.
but
my
opposing
counsel
brought
out
that
he
could
just
go
back
and
demand
he
his
job
at
any
time.
i
would
tell
you,
the
state
in
my
place
that
mr.
andrews
has
gone
back,
he
is
gone
back
with
three
physician
certificates,
he
went
to
the
chief
surgeon
for
the
railroad
who
absolutely
refused
to
examine
him
even
and
said
get
out,
we
don't
want
you
anyway,
get
out
of
my
office
and
throw
him
out.
he
is
now
neither
a
fish
not
a
fowl,
because
he
is
not
fired
and
he
is
not
employed.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
there
is
no
record
judge,
i
am
awfully
sorry,
there
has
been
no
discovery
--
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
it
might
be
dispositive
in
one
respect
mr.
chief
justice.
in
another
respect
i
would
say
and
the
only
way
it
could
be
dispositive
i
think
it
would
be
in
the
favor
of
the
petitioner
here.
but,
even
filing
the
other
way
i
would
certainly
urge
the
court
to
find
the
moore
doctrine
is
well
supported
in
rationale
and
that
has
not
been
changed
through
out
the
years
and
had
expression
by
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
very
well,
your
honor
i
think
--
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
i
would
like
go
ahead
with
that
if
i
may.
justice
black
expressed
the
view
that
the
labor
and
management
relations
act
should
never
be
construed
so
as
to
require
individual
employee,
after
he
is
out
of
the
job
to
submit
a
claim
involving
wages
to
grievance
and
arbitration
proceedings
or
to
surrender
his
right
to
sue
his
employer
in
court
for
the
enforcement
of
his
claim
acquired.
well
again
this
was
brought
out
by
the
opposing
counsel.
the
railroad
and
union
agree,
but
mr.
andrews
is
doesn't
agree,
he
is
out
in
the
court,
he
doesn't
have
a
job,
he
didn't
have
union,
he
is
out,
he
wants
to
sue
the
railroad
for
wrongful
discharge,
he
has
an
action
for
wrongful
discharge
recognizable
in
the
state
courts,
he
is
to
free
pursue
it
because
of
the
moore
decision
and
really
when
we
get
right
down
to
the
final
last
word
on
the
argument
it's
our
position
that
we
are
relying
on
the
moore
doctrine
is
well
founded
and
has
never
been
changed,
either
by
legislative
or
judicial
act.
i
appreciate
your
attention.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
thomas
l.
andrews
who
used
to
be
a
railroad
man.
one
day
mr.
andrews
had
an
automobile
accident,
which
had
nothing
to
with
his
employment
where
he
was
injured
necessitating
a
medical
furlough
which
he
was
duly
given.
in
due
time
he
regained
his
health
and
attempted
to
return
to
work.
when
he
got
back,
tried
to
go
to
work,
he
found
that
he
was
still
on
medical
furlough
and
even
with
the
doctor'
certificate
he
was
not
permitted
to
work,
and
of
course
he
was
not
paid
either.
the
railroad,
of
course,
in
its
defensive
pleadings
contended
that
he
was
neither
a
fish
nor
a
fowl,
that
he
was
not
employed
and
he
was
not
discharged.
mr.
andrews
in
his
complaint,
originally
in
the
state
court,
then
removed
to
federal
district
court
contends
that
these
acts
and
other
acts
amount
to
a
common
law
of
wrongful
discharge
which
the
state
of
georgia
recognizes
as
a
common
law
action.
now
what
we
have
today
is
really
a
jurisdictional
question
and
it's
to
determine
whether
or
not
courts
have
jurisdiction
over
a
common
law
wrongful
discharge
action
arising
out
of
a
discharge
of
a
union
railroad
employee
or
whether
the
employee
must,
and
i
use
the
term
exhaust
loosely
of
the
moment,
exhaust
his
administrative
remedies.
i
think
i
can
show
later
that
we
no
longer
have
an
exhaustion
of
the
administrative
remedies,
rather
it
amounts
to
an
election
of
administrative
remedies.
the
court
has
undoubtedly
noticed
how
brief
the
petitioner's
brief
is,
because
we
have
a
very
simple
contention.
we
rely
primarily,
almost
solely
on
the
moore
versus
central
illinois
railroad
company
decided
by
this
court
in
1940.
the
rationale
in
that
case
of
course
was
that
a
railroad
union
employee
could
elect
either
to
pursue
his
administrative
remedies
or
could
sue
in
the
court
of
law
for
a
common
wrongful
discharge,
and
we
rely
squarely
on
that
case.
mr.
moore
was
fired
by
the
illinois
central
railroad
because
he
had
the
audacity
to
sue
them
on
an
fela
case,
should
understand
that
as
general
--
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
no,
your
honor,
he
does
not.
he
wants
to
sue
them
for
damages.
the
board
could,
if
he
made
his
election
and
i
don't
call
that
exhaustion,
but
if
he
made
his
election,
the
board
could
reinstate
him,
grant
him
back
pay,
and
give
him
his
job.
he
doesn't
want
that.
he
wants
to
sue
for
damages.
this
court
has
said,
by
the
way,
on
numerous
occasions
and
i
will
quote
in
the
slocum
case,
a
common
law
statutory
action
for
wrongful
discharge
differs
from
any
remedy
that
board
has
power
to
provide
and
does
not
involve
questions
of
future
relations
between
the
railroad
and
other
employees.
of
course,
this
general
philosophy
was
stated
very
well
by
mr.
justice
blackmun
in
the
arguelles
case
which
i've
cited
not,
by
the
way,
as
authority
for
this
case,
but
because
of
the
language
in
that,
i
would
like
to
get
to
it
a
minute.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
i
think
there
would
be
several
things,
sir,
mr.
justice
brennan.
one,
of
course
there
would
be
the
difference
between
the
wages
that
he
would
have
made
with
railroad
and
wages
he
has
in
the
past.
also,
prospectively
--
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
that's
right,
your
honor,
under
a
common
law
theory.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
that's
right.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
that's
right,
it
would
be
post
factor
as
well.
although,
i
believe
in
rare
instances
the
board
can,
i
believe
can
award
attorneys
fees.
i
think
[voice
overlap]
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
that's
right
mr.
justice
brennan,
plus
reinstatement
working
back
at
the
railroad.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
well,
general
damages
being,
the
measure
of
damages,
of
course,
we
would
look
to
the
current
trend,
see
what
his
wages
would
have
been
had
he
been
employed,
and
what
wages
he
has
earned,
the
difference
being
the
measure
of
damages
that
would
be
retrospective
and
in
post
factor,
of
course
it
would
be
a
jury
question
to
determine
what
his
future
damages
might
be.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
mr.
justice
white,
i
certainly
do,
i
believe.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
yes
sir,
mr.
justice
white,
i
believe
that
could
be
done.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
georgia
recognizes
a
doctrine
known
as
constructive
service,
where
a
man
makes
himself
available
for
work
under
his
employment
contract
he
can
remain
available
and
say
i
am
ready
to
work
and
you
have
to
pay
me.
now
of
course
if
they
offer
--
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
that's
a
difficult
question,
i
am
not
sure
is
decided
by
georgia
law.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
that's
a
very
difficult
question.
i
think
it's
not
answered
by
georgia
law.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
but
i
would
nonetheless,
going
to
the
extent
i
don't
think
the
acts
can
cut
both
ways.
i
don't
think
it
--
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
yes
sir.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
that's
right.
whatever
the
state
law
provides
may
vary
from
state
to
state
as
well.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
well,
to
start
with
mr.
justice
white,
i
am
not
sure
of
this.
i
am
not
sure
if
this
is
a
breach
of
contract
case
anyway.
there
is
some
question
about
that.
the
georgia
courts
have
had
numerous
cases
on
the
wrongful
discharge
that
has
never
been
a
holding
that
this
is
a
matter
in
breach
of
contract.
assuming
it
was
for
a
moment,
that
is
what
mr.
moore
sued
for
breach
of
contract.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
excuse
me?
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
yes,
mr.
justice
white,
he
does.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
yes,
mr.
justice
white,
it
does,
but
nonetheless
i
am
not
sure
that,
that
makes
it
an
action
in
contract,
that
is
to
say
an
action
x
contract
--
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
equivalent
or
not
there
was
justification
under
the
contract
--
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
i
think
its
state
law
your
honor,
under
the
transcontinental
&
western
airlines
versus
koppal.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
they
are
mooted
--
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
yes,
your
honor,
there
is
one
case,
it's
very
critical.
in
fact
there
are
two
cases,
i
would
like
to
discuss
in
this
connection.
the
first
is
union
pacific
railroad
company
versus
price,
i
will
call
it
price
case.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
i
believe
so.
this
is
a
case
that
really
destroys
your
exhaustion
of
remedies
and
makes
it
an
election
of
remedies
because
here
mr.
price
was
fired.
i
think
he
also
sued
the
railroad
under
fela
action.
they
fired
him
because
of
it.
he
pursued
his
administrative
remedy.
the
adjustment
board
found
that
he
had
been
properly
discharged.
so
he
said,
okay,
i
have
exhausted
my
administrative
remedies,
i
will
go
into
my
court
and
of
course
holding
of
this
court
in
that
case
was
that
you
can't
re-litigate
similar
issues.
so,
we
can
forget
about
exhausting
of
administrative
remedies
and
i
think
we
should
from
now
on
be
discussing
election
of
remedies.
no
case
has
really
undermined
the
moore
decision
as
the
railroad
contends.
even
the
case
of
roy
walker
versus
southern
railway,
that's
a
real
bugaboo
case
unfortunately
because
it
set
some
real
misapplications
to
stop
while
its
not
a
wrongful
discharge
type
case
to
begin
with
and
should
not
fit
within
the
particular
more
exclusion
and
should
not
be
applied
to
it.
what
it
really
was
a
was
a
competition
in
time
case.
mr.
roy
walker
also
took
sick
leave,
he
gave
the
railroad
notice
that
he
was
ill.
the
railroad
contended
that
he
had
given
it
too
late
within
30
days
required
by
the
contract.
roy
walker
contended
he
had
given
it
in
time.
the
question
really
that
was
not
wrongful
discharge
but
was
a
case
whether
or
not
he
had
given
this
notice
in
time.
so
it
was
time
confrontation
case.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
i
think
it
is
now
because
of
the
price
case
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
i
think
that's
a
question
to
be
determined
by
georgia
law
and
by
a
jury,
your
honor.
i
agree
that
i
think
--
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
it
may
be
a
mis-question
of
law,
in
fact
depending
on
on
whether
or
not
the
offer
is
believable.
for
instance,
mr.
andrews
in
this
case
may
very
well
and
i
would
state
in
my
place,
probably
will
on
the
trial
of
the
case
show
by
evidence
that
his
wrongful
discharge
was
occasioned
by
things
other
than
his
illness
and
that
the
illness
was
a
mere
charade,
a
mere
sham
and
there
are
other
reasons
the
railroad
wants
to
dump
him,
and
that
the
offer
is
not
a
real
genuine
or
bona
fide
offer
but
is
a
way
to
mitigate
damages.
much
is
attached
in
an
fela
case
where
the
railroad
argues
to
the
jury,
well,
he
has
done
this
wonderful
job,
ironies
and
what
not,
their
total
verdict
and
then
he
gets
fired.
so,
i
think
it
maybe
a
mixed
question
of
law
in
fact
and
i
think
it
could
be
properly
submitted
to
a
jury
predicated
on
state
law.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
no,
no.
mr.
justice
brennan,
as
matter
of
fact
i
think
these
are
key
questions,
because
of
the
collateral
cases
surrounding
the
original
moore
decision,
that
it
confuses
the
situation
so
badly.
as
i
first
stated
--
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
if
you
would
overrule
moore
--
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
not
only
would
mr.
andrews
have
to
go
to
the
adjustment
board,
mr.
justice
brennan,
you
would
forever
slam
the
court
house
door
in
any
other
claim
--
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
well,
yes
mr.
justice
brennan
that
was
true
with
several
notable
exceptions.
of
course
the
foundation
of
the
roy
walker
case,
it's
our
contention
that
it
is
not
really
well
laid.
i
think
as
mr.
justice
stewart
and
mr.
justice
white
pointed
out,
you
can't
really
make
a
jurisdictional
determination
on
how
well
or
fully
railroad
adjustment
board
is
doing.
it
would
be
patently
discriminatory,
what
if
some
poor
fellow
up
in
new
york
who's
board
is
way
behind
because
they
have
a
lot
of
claims.
so,
he
gets
to
sue
and
the
guy
in
southern
california
where
they
don't
have
many
claims,
where
he
has
to
go
through
the
board.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
speed
up
remedies
--
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan,
it
has
happened.
about
50%
of
collective
decisions
--
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
well
even
less,
say
four
years
or
in
some
places
one-and-a-half
years.
they
vary,
but
of
course
you
can
have
a
variable
jurisdiction
throughout
the
country
depending
on
how
the
board
is
doing.
besides
that,
what
if
the
board
slow
down
five
years
now,
going
to
let
more
roy
walker
slip
through.
well,
i
think
they
couldn't
very
well
do
that
either,
that
would
be
discriminatory.
it
really
shouldn't
be
predicated
though
on
how
well
the
board
is
doing.
it's
a
matter
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
well,
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
take
the
position
that
a
judicial
review
is
not
a
review
they
now
--
i
maybe
mistaken
but
i
think
that
the
findings
in
fact
[voice
overlap]
the
case
--
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
perhaps
you
did
mr.
justice
--
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
it's
my
understanding
that
mr.
price
would
not
be
permitted
to
re-litigate
issues
already
determined
and
it
would
be
petitioner's
contention,
that
would
be
basically
the
same
as
now
that
when
a
matter
once
decided
would
not
be
re-litigated
on
factual
finding.
there
is
another
interesting
thing
about
the
1966
amendments
which
i
respectfully
submit
was
totally
overlooked
by
the
court
in
the
roy
walker
case
which
is
that
the
1966
amendments
should
be
a
clear
designation
of
legislative
intent
in
this
regard.
that
is
to
say,
sweeping
changes
were
made
and
some
real
positive
things
were
done
by
the
legislature
to
speed
up
the
remedies,
all
sort
of
balance
and
add
a
little
bit
too,
i
think.
but
in
all
of
the
committee
reports
and
in
all
of
the
legislative
committee
meetings
and
the
history
of
the
legislature
there,
and
in
the
legislation
itself,
there
is
not
one
single
word,
not
one
iota
of
change
as
to
the
scope
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
board,
nor
the
limitation
of
the
federal
or
state
courts
in
these
matters.
i
don't
know
where
you
can
get
a
much
clearer
mandate
in
a
legislature.
they
had
their
opportunity.
it
was
a
big
crisis.
it
was
a
big
issue.
=
something
had
to
be
done.
they
did
some
procedural
things
and
they
dare
not
touch
the
authority
or
the
scope
of
the
jurisdiction
--
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
this
is
a
perfect
opportunity
to
end
this
legal
battle
or
the
chipping
away
and
the
pecking
away
of
moore
with
the
koppal
decision.
there
is
another
area,
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
which
is
the
real
distinguishing
characteristic
between
what
i
call
moore
type
cases,
that
is
to
say
a
purely
wrongful
discharge
case
and
a
slocum
type
case
or
charlie
maddox
type
case,
that's
maddox
versus
republic
steel
company.
these
are
cases
where
someone,
and
by
the
way
the
slocum
type
case,
mr.
slocum
was
the
chairman
of
the
railroad
union,
two
unions
were
in
dispute
as
to
who
had
jurisdiction
over
certain
area
of
work.
the
railroad
attempted
to
file
in
state
court
an
action
for
a
declaratory
judgment
to
make
a
determination
and
of
course,
they
were
required
to
go
by
the
arbitration
method.
this
was
completely
distinguished
in
the
slocum
case
from
the
moore
type
case
where
this
is
an
ex-employee
who
is
not
involved
in
rights
by
the
railroad
employees,
and
he
is
still
in
the
railroad
just
like
their
(inaudible).
the
walker
case
is
like
a
slocum
case.
charlie
maddox's
case
was
a
case
where
charlie
maddox
had
been
properly
laid
off
and
was
suing
only
for
severed
claim
in
the
contract.
now
i
said
that
i
would
come
to
the
arguelles
case.
i
want
to
mention
it
just
very
briefly
because
i
think
that
can
straighten
out
some
also
very
unfortunate
language
that
came
out
of
the
roy
walker
case,
and
that
was
the
language
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
instant
case
used,
even
though
they
conceded
that
although
the
law
was
on
my
side
nonetheless
a
ruling
against
me
was
this,
the
overruling
act
has
also
held
that
is
about
a
certain
as
a
season,
changing
as
the
season
coming
from
mr
justice
black
in
that
case.
mr.
justice
black,
in
the
arguelles
case
made
a
very
strong,
very
fine
statement
and
i
think
it
reflects
the
feeling
of
this
court,
the
thrust
of
this
court
and
its
perseverance
and
continue
to
try
to
maintain
the
courthouse
door
is
open
to
the
public,
to
the
little
man,
where
mr.
justice
black
and
this
was
consideration,
by
the
way
arguelles
case
was
a
seaman
suing
under
a
statutory
right
to
elect.
the
court
says,
in
arguelles
the
legislature
clearly
preserved
his
right
to
sue.
in
the
section
301,
in
which
the
case
has
been,
section
301
the
legislature
has
not
clearly
taken
it
away,
and
it
would
be
highly
precipitous
for
this
court
or
any
court,
to
remove
the
man's
right
to
litigate
a
wrongful
discharge,
a
common
law
action
in
a
court
without
specific
legislative
action
and
no
clear
reflection
of
any
legislative
intent
toward
that
direction
in
any
event.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
could
he
get
a
reinstatement
in
court?
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
so,
i
think
--
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
well,
i
don't
believe
you
can
force
someone
to
be
employed
somewhere.
i
don't
believe
the
railroad
to
be
forced
to
make
him,
he
was
an
electrician,
so
say,
i
don't
believe
that
you
can
force
a
railroad
to
let
him
put
together
their
switch
box,
they
may
have
to
pay
him,
may
have
to
give
him
damages,
but
i
don't
believe
that
they
have
got
to
employ.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
yes,
your
honor,
it
does
readily.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
no,
your
honor,
i
think
damages,
general
damages
for
common
law
wrong
are
totally
different
damages
and
they
can't
--
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
well,
perhaps,
a
court
could.
i
don't
believe
the
railroad
or
thomas
l.
andrews
want
reinstatement
and
i
think
the
evidence
indicates
--
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
mr.
justice
white,
in
all
probability
a
court
could
tell
the
railroad
either
it
had
to
hire
him
or
--
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
no.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
that's
never
been
litigated
to
my
knowledge,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
but
that
would
be
my
position,
yes.
because
you
can't
make
the
railroad
put
someone
in
their
machine
shop
monkeying
around
with
their
equipment
that
they
don't
want.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
if
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
your
honor
it
is
my
understanding
that
he
cannot,
but
he
can
sue
his
railroads
for
failure
to
do
it,
i
believe
there
is
supreme
court
case
on
this.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
i
think
the
employee
once
he
is
fired,
once
he
is
out
in
the
court,
i
believe
he
can
sue
the
union
for
its
failure
to
adequately
represent
him
and
join
--
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
mr.
justice
brennan
it’s
my
impression
is
that
he
cannot
go
himself,
representing
himself
or
through
his
counsel
representing
him.
this
is
my
impression
i
am
no
libel...
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
what
this
case
is
all
about
your
honor
--
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
may
it
please
court,
we
have
taken
the
position
that
he
cannot.
most
particularly
in
an
interesting
case
like
the
case
at
bar.
i
hadn’t
intended
it
to
bring
this
out.
there
is
no
evidence
by
the
way,
there
has
been
no
discovery
in
the
case,
and
it
is
almost
pure
law
question.
but
my
opposing
counsel
brought
out
that
he
could
just
go
back
and
demand
he
his
job
at
any
time.
i
would
tell
you,
the
state
in
my
place
that
mr.
andrews
has
gone
back,
he
is
gone
back
with
three
physician
certificates,
he
went
to
the
chief
surgeon
for
the
railroad
who
absolutely
refused
to
examine
him
even
and
said
get
out,
we
don't
want
you
anyway,
get
out
of
my
office
and
throw
him
out.
he
is
now
neither
a
fish
not
a
fowl,
because
he
is
not
fired
and
he
is
not
employed.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
there
is
no
record
judge,
i
am
awfully
sorry,
there
has
been
no
discovery
--
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
it
might
be
dispositive
in
one
respect
mr.
chief
justice.
in
another
respect
i
would
say
and
the
only
way
it
could
be
dispositive
i
think
it
would
be
in
the
favor
of
the
petitioner
here.
but,
even
filing
the
other
way
i
would
certainly
urge
the
court
to
find
the
moore
doctrine
is
well
supported
in
rationale
and
that
has
not
been
changed
through
out
the
years
and
had
expression
by
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
very
well,
your
honor
i
think
--
mr.
andrew
w.
estes
i
would
like
go
ahead
with
that
if
i
may.
justice
black
expressed
the
view
that
the
labor
and
management
relations
act
should
never
be
construed
so
as
to
require
individual
employee,
after
he
is
out
of
the
job
to
submit
a
claim
involving
wages
to
grievance
and
arbitration
proceedings
or
to
surrender
his
right
to
sue
his
employer
in
court
for
the
enforcement
of
his
claim
acquired.
well
again
this
was
brought
out
by
the
opposing
counsel.
the
railroad
and
union
agree,
but
mr.
andrews
is
doesn't
agree,
he
is
out
in
the
court,
he
doesn't
have
a
job,
he
didn't
have
union,
he
is
out,
he
wants
to
sue
the
railroad
for
wrongful
discharge,
he
has
an
action
for
wrongful
discharge
recognizable
in
the
state
courts,
he
is
to
free
pursue
it
because
of
the
moore
decision
and
really
when
we
get
right
down
to
the
final
last
word
on
the
argument
it's
our
position
that
we
are
relying
on
the
moore
doctrine
is
well
founded
and
has
never
been
changed,
either
by
legislative
or
judicial
act.
i
appreciate
your
attention.
