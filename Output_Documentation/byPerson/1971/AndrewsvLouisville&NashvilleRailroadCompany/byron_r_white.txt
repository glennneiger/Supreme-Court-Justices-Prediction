white
why
not?
justice
byron

white
well,
doesn't
the

justice

white
can't
you
get
the

why
couldn't

my
question

my
question.is
there
some

now
if
i
may
ask
you,

that
isn’t

the
only
way
it
gets
to
the
adjustment
board
is
if
somebody
takes
it
there?
justice
byron

white
what
i
really
am
asking,
may
the
railroad
and
the
worker
together
waive
the
adjustment
board?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah
but
they
don't
settle
it,

we
don't
want
to
go
to
the

you
don't
want
to
go
to
the
adjustment
board,
go
to

we
will
settle
it
in
the
court.
justice

no,
exhaustion
administrative
remedies
required,
all
the
act

is
that
somebody
can
it
take
it
to
the
board
and
if
somebody
takes
it
the
board,
the
other
party
is
got
to
go
there
too.
