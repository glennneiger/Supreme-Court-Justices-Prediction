mr.
walter
p.
north
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
commission
is
grateful
for
the
opportunity
to
participate
in
this
argument
before
and
today.
you
have,
on
many
occasions
permitted
us
to
file
amicus
briefs,
but
participation
of
the
argument
means
even
more
to
us
now,
try
to
make
good
use
of
the
time
you
have
awarded
us.
i
like
to
start
in
substantially
where
the
counsel
for
the
petitioner
left
off
on
this
question
of
fragmentation
which
is,
in
my
way
of
thinking
the
thing
that
caused
the
court
below
to
go
wrong
and
is
the
point
at
which
the
argument
is
now
made
by
the
opposition
in
support
to
that
result
is
also
erroneous.
on
pages
two
and
three
of
our
briefs,
we
quote
both
section
17
from
the
1933
act
which
has
the
anti
fraud
provision
there
and
section
10
(b)
in
rule
10
(b)
(5)
from
the
1934
act.
and
i
direct
the
court’s
attention
to
this
difference
between
the
two
which
i
say
the
court
below
overlooked
entirely.
section
17
(a)
says
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
person
in
the
offer
or
sale
of
any
security
by
use
of
interstate
so
on
and
so
forth
to
employ
fraud.
in
other
words,
the
fraud
must
be
in
the
offer
or
sale
of
any
security.
whereas
in
the
1934
act,
the
requirement
is
not
that
the
fraud
be
right
inside
of
the
sale
or
purchase
itself,
but
that
it
be
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale.
now,
you
are
not
ascribing
anything,
any
meaning
at
all
to
those
words
and
that
difference
between
these
two
statutes,
if
your
rule
as
a
court
below
did,
that
there
is
not
a
case
stated
under
10
(b)
from
10
(b)
(5)
in
this
case
then
i
would
direct
your
attention
at
the
bottom
of
page
three
and
the
top
of
page
four,
to
the
fact
that
rule
10
(b)
(5)
has
three
sub
paragraphs.
i
submit
that
the
court
below
refused
to
take
any
cognizance
of
sub
paragraphs
one
and
three
of
that
rule.
they
fragmented
this
thing
down
to
the
point
where
they
refused
to
look
at
it
as
an
overall
scheme
device
or
artifice
to
the
fraud,
which
is
the
words
used
in
sub
paragraph
one
or
to
look
upon
it
as
sub
paragraph
three
says
“as
engaging
in
an
act,
practice
or
course
of
business
which
operates
as
a
fraud
or
a
deceit
upon
any
person.
they
analyzed
this
case
solely
in
terms
of
the
second
paragraph
of
the
second
sub
paragraph
of
rule
10
(b)
(5)
and
even
there,
took
an
unduly
limited
and
restricted
view
of
it
because
it
says
“that
it
should
be
unlawful
to
make
any
untrue
statement
of
material
facts
or
to
omit
those
state
--
a
material
fact
in
connection
with
purchase
or
sale
of
securities.
as
counsel
has
already
said,
there
is
abundant
evidence
that
they
did
misrepresent
to
the
directors
and
they
did
fail
to
disclose
to
the
directors
their
true
intention
as
to
what
they
are
going
to
do
with
the
proceeds
of
this
sale
of
bonds.
remember
that
earlier
in
the
day,
going
to
the
bank
and
got
a
five
million
dollar
check
written
with
nothing
behind
it.
they
obviously
had
to
be
intending
to
convert
the
proceeds
of
the
sale
of
the
bonds
in
order
to
cover
the
check
and
that
is
exactly
what
they
did,
and
they
deceived
the
directors
in
that
respect.
so
i
say
that
the
court,
by
refusing
to
look
at
the
thing
in
that
sort
of
a
way,
and
by
refusing
to
connect
that
one
sale
of
government
bonds,
which
by
the
way
is
the
particulars
of
the
transaction
that
the
government
relies
on
in
this
case,
they
refused
to
look
upon
that
as
a
part
of
an
overall
scheme
and
the
other
parts
of
which
were
also
essential
to
this
scheme
and
all
of
which
should
be
considered
as
a
package,
not
as
individual
fragmented
facts.
mr.
walter
p.
north
we
separate
the
bonds
from
the
stock
only
to
the
extent
that
we
say
that
the
government
relies
on
the
bond
sale
as
the
basis
for
which
we
say
the
court
of
appeals
below
should
be
reversed.
mr.
walter
p.
north
certainly
not.
mr.
walter
p.
north
that
all,
as
long
as
we
show
that
someone
part
of
the
scheme
involved
the
purchase
or
sale
or
is
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
--.
mr.
walter
p.
north
we
say
the
stock
selling
section
was
a
part
of
the
overall
scheme.
it's
the
same
as
the
bond
sale
and
the
same
as
these
subsequent
things
they
did,
the
transactions
they
carried
out
in
the
afternoon
of
that
day
where
they
went
through
this
business
of
chasing
themselves
out
around
the
circle
and
coming
back
where
they
ended
exactly
where
they
started
from,
that
was
all
a
part
of
the
scheme
to
the
defraud.
the
reason
that
we
did
not
dwell
upon
the
sale
of
manhattan’s
own
stock
from
bankers
life
to
the
defrauders
as
a
part
of
our
case
is
because
that
runs
directly
contrary
to
birnbaum
which
says
that
the
defrauded
party
must
be
either
a
purchaser
or
a
seller,
well
of
course
manhattan
itself
did
not
sell
anything
or
buy
anything.
mr.
walter
p.
north
we
have
suggested
that
on
a
number
of
occasions,
we
have
suggested
it
in
the
second
circuit
itself.
mr.
walter
p.
north
and
we
suggested
in
this
case,
largely
just
by
a
way
of
a
footnote
that
says
that
we
have
never
agreed
to
that
theory,
but
we
realize
that
in
order
to
win
this
case
on
that
ground
you
had
to
overturn
birnbaum
whereas
you
do
not
necessarily
overturn
it
and
the
other
is
context.
incidentally
i
think
it
is
quite
significant
in
that
regard
that
judge
hayes,
who
dissented
as
one
member
of
the
three
judge
panel
who
decided
this
very
occasion
today,
he
just
flatly
would
overrule
birnbaum.
let
me
read
you
just
two
sentences,
his
opinion
is
only
a
page-and-a-half
long,
as
reprinted
in
the
appendix
on
pages
109
and
110,
just
two
sentences.
he
says
manhattan
was
the
victim
of
a
“scheme
to
defraud,”
which
is
the
language
of
the
of
rule.
since
the
vital
center
of
the
scheme,
the
vehicle
for
the
perpetration
of
the
fraud
was
the
sale
of
manhattan’s
stock,
it
seems
to
me
to
be
completely
unrealistic
to
say
that
the
fraud
was
committed
“in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
any
security.”
well,
now
judge
hayes
knows
just
as
well
as
any
of
us
here
in
the
room
do,
that
the
sale
of
manhattan's
stock
did
not
involve
manhattan
as
either
a
purchaser
or
as
a
seller.
and
he
is
saying
in
so
many
words
that
when
you
have
got
an
overall
scheme
to
defraud,
you
do
not
fragment
it
to
look
at
the
overall
scheme
and
if
any
part
of
it
was
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
securities,
that
is
the
answer.
the
answer
does
apply
in
the
question
of
whether
the
plaintiff
himself
happened
to
be
a
purchaser
or
a
seller
and
it
seems
to
me
that
anything
short
of
that
simply
overlooks
the
difference
in
wording
between
section
17
of
the
1933
act
and
section
10
(b)
and
rule
10
(b)
(5)
or
the
1934
act
because
the
one
says
it
must
be
in
connection
with
the
sale
or
as
the
other
--
the
one
says
it
must
be
in
the
sale
or
in
the
purchase,
whereas
the
other
says
that
it
has
to
be
in
connection
with
a
purchase
or
sale
by
any
person.
i
would
like
to
deal,
just
a
moment
with
this
question
of
whether
we
are
pursuing
a
purely
self
inflicted
fraud
that
really
did
not
hurt
anybody
because
mr.
begole
or
mr.
begole
and
bourne
themselves
were
the
sole
owners
of
this
corporation.
that
kind
of
a
position
of
course
overlooks
the
community
of
interest
which
a
corporation
represents
over
and
beyond
the
interest
of
the
stockholder
or
stockholder
alone.
if
you
had,
for
example
a
corporation
that
had
outstanding
bonds
or
debentures
or
other
form
of
debt
securities,
you
certainly
would
not
say
that
they
want,
that
that
interest
was
not
to
be
protected
and
likewise
the
interest
of
other
creditors
and
policy
holders
is
all
a
part
of
the
overall
community
that
the
statute
is
designed
to
present
to
protect,
not
just
to
protect
alone
the
shareholder,
who
in
this
case
was
the
sole
shareholder
who
was
the
one
who
perpetrated
the
fraud.
mr.
walter
p.
north
you
mean
under
10
(b)
(5)?
mr.
walter
p.
north
the
representative
of
the
creditor
certainly
would
have
that
right
and
here
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
is
the
superintendent
of
insurance.
mr.
walter
p.
north
pardon?
mr.
walter
p.
north
no
i
do
not
say
that,
but
i
do
not
think
that
is
the
key
thing
here.
the
key
thing
here
is
that
the
action
is
being
brought
by
the
superintendent
of
insurance
derivatively
on
behalf
of
the
corporation
which
in
turn
had
some
creditors
so
that
the
creditors
are
a
part
of
the
community
of
interest
which
is
being
protected
by
this
suit
under
10
(b)
(5).
mr.
walter
p.
north
i
do
not
know
to
what
extend
there
are
still
outstanding
unsatisfied
claims,
i
think
i
have
to
refer
that
question
maybe
to
private
counsel
but
i
do
know
that
--
mr.
walter
p.
north
in
the
process
to
whatever
extent
the
creditors
have
been
paid,
i
will
assume
that
in
the
process,
someone
else
has
been
subrogated
to
their
right.
superintendent
of
insurance
is
not
bringing
this
action
on
behalf
of
mr.
begole,
that
is
certain
and
there
is
abundant
authority
for
the
proposition
that
creditors
are
entitled
to
protection.
your
own
case
here
of
pepper
versus
litton
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
while
it
predates
the
federal
securities
laws,
makes
it
perfectly
clear
that
a
so-called
self
inflicted
fraud
by
somebody
who
controls
a
corporation
still
cannot
be
relied
upon
as
a
means
of
defeating
the
action
which
is
brought
on
behalf
of
creditors
or
anyone
who
is
dealt
with
or
contracted
with
the
corporation.
mr.
walter
p.
north
yes
something
of
that.
mr.
walter
p.
north
that
is
right,
if
that
could
be.
the
leading
case
i
think
in
this
area
that
actually
does
come
under
the
federal
securities
laws
whereas
pepper
versus
litton
just
before
the
1934
act.
the
leading
case
that
does
come
under
the
federal
securities
laws
is
the
hooper
versus
mountain
state's
case
and
in
there
it
was
plainly
held
even
though
the
corporation
itself
was
controlled
by
the
person
who
committed
the
fraud,
the
fact
did
not
mean
that
there
could
not
be
recovery
for
the
benefit
of
creditors
or
anybody
else
who
had
dealt
with
the
corporation
in
reliance
on
the
court
with
transaction
and
the
bail's
case
which
is
referred
to
here
earlier
is
to
the
same
effect
and
it
is
so
recent
that
this
does
not
even
appear
on
our
brief,
it
was
decided
since
our
brief
was
written.
and
i
think
it
is
important
in
this
connection
to
note
that
congress
at
the
very
time
it
was
drafting
this
statute
had
in
mind,
in
relation
to
insurance
companies,
the
fact
that
creditors
and
policy
holders
could
be
involved.
the
house
report,
i
am
paraphrasing
or
quoting
now
on
facts
away
from
the
footnote
in
page
27
of
our
brief,
the
house
report
on
the
bill
which
became
the
1934
act
noted
that
over
15
million
individuals
hold
insurance
policies,
the
values
of
which
is
dependent
upon
the
security
holdings
of
insurance
companies.
that
is
quoted
exactly
from
the
house
report.
the
senate
report
went
on
to
observe
that
the
current
value
of
securities
held
by
insurance
companies
and
consequently
the
welfare
of
the
countless
individuals
who
have
a
financial
interest
in
such
institutions
is
directly
effected
by
the
activities,
he
is
talking
now
about
his
activities
in
the
trading
and
sale
of
securities.
so
while
it
can
be
said
that
congress
was
not
perhaps
directly
concerned
with
creditors
and
policy
holders
as
such
to
the
extent
that
part
of
the
community
of
interest
that
makes
up
an
insurance
company
is
creditors
and
policy
holders
that
is
a
part
of
what
congress
was
directing
itself
to
when
it
enacted
the
anti
fraud
provisions
of
the
1934
act.
mr.
walter
p.
north
well
that
would
be
a
little
harder
case
but
--
mr.
walter
p.
north
i
would
not
be
prepared
to
conceive
if
there
would
not
be
a
10
(b)
(5)
action
even
under
those
circumstances,
but
this
case
is
much
stronger
than
that
because
there
was
a
pre-conceived
plan
or
scheme
to
do
this
very
thing
and
the
sale
of
the
securities
was
a
part
of
that
scheme.
mr.
walter
p.
north
that
is
a
part
of
the
type
of
reasoning
of
the
court
below
used
in
this
case,
but
as
long
as
you
maintain
the
integrity
of
the
requirement
that
the
fraud
be
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
securities.
there
is
certainly
no
danger
that
that
federal
securities
laws
is
going
to
take
over
the
whole
field
of
the
corporate
mismanagement
and
looting,
and
everything
else
whereas
securities
transactions
are
not
involved.
the
securities
transaction
must
still
be
a
part
of
the
fraudulent
scheme
in
order
for
the
(voice
overlap)
mr.
walter
p.
north
mr.
justice
white
i
assume
you
are
talking
now
about
the
requirement
that
the
plaintiff
himself
be
a
purchaser
or
a
seller.
i
think
that
the
requirement
of
the
purchaser
or
seller
himself
or
the
plaintiff
himself
be
a
purchaser
or
seller
can
be
done
away
with
and
still
not
make
this
federal
securities
laws
and
the
fraud
provision,
an
undue
incursion
upon
the
state
law
of
fraud,
as
long
as
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale.
that
is
why
i
would
say
that
even
this
initial
sale
of
all
of
manhattan's
stock
to
begole
should
come
within
the
purview
of
this
and
would,
in
some
other
circuits
though
obviously
it
cannot
in
the
second
circuit
unless
and
until
the
birnbaum
case
is
overruled.
mr.
walter
p.
north
i
believe
it
is,
your
honor
and
i
am
sorry
if
i
ran
over.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
walter
p.

mr.

justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
commission
is
grateful
for
the
opportunity
to
participate
in
this
argument
before
and
today.
you
have,
on
many
occasions
permitted

direct

sale
of
any
security
by
use
of
interstate
so
on
and
so
forth
to
employ
fraud.
in
other
words,
the
fraud
must
be
in
the
offer
or
sale
of
any
security.
whereas
in
the
1934
act,
the
requirement
is
not
that
the
fraud
be
right
inside
of
the
sale
or
purchase
itself,
but
that
it
be
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale.
now,
you
are
not
ascribing
anything,
any
meaning
at
all
to
those
words
and
that
difference
between
these
two
statutes,
if
your
rule
as
a
court
below
did,
that
there
is
not
a
case
stated
under
10
(b)
from
10
(b)
(5)
in
this
case
then
i
would
direct
your
attention
at
the
bottom
of
page
three
and
the
top
of
page
four,
to
the
fact
that
rule
10
(b)
(5)
has
three
sub
paragraphs.
i
submit
that
the
court
below
refused
to
take
any
cognizance
of
sub
paragraphs
one
and
three
of
that
rule.
they
fragmented
this
thing
down
to
the
point
where
they
refused
to
look
at
it
as
an
overall
scheme
device
or
artifice
to
the
fraud,
which
is
the
words
used
in
sub
paragraph
one
or
to
look
upon
it
as
sub
paragraph
three
says
“as
engaging
in
an
act,
practice
or
course
of
business
which
operates
as
a
fraud
or
a
deceit
upon
any
person.
they
analyzed
this
case
solely
in
terms
of
the
second
paragraph
of
the
second
sub
paragraph
of
rule
10
(b)
(5)
and
even
there,
took
an
unduly
limited
and
restricted
view
of
it
because
it
says
“that
it
should
be
unlawful
to
make
any
untrue
statement
of
material
facts
or
to
omit
those
state
--
a
material
fact
in
connection
with
purchase
or
sale
of
securities.
as
counsel
has
already
said,
there
is
abundant
evidence
that
they
did
misrepresent
to
the
directors
and
they
did
fail
to
disclose
to
the
directors
their
true
intention
as
to
what
they
are
going
to
do
with
the
proceeds
of
this
sale
of
bonds.
remember
that
earlier
in
the
day,
going
to
the
bank
and
got
a
five
million
dollar
check
written
with
nothing
behind
it.
they
obviously
had
to
be
intending
to
convert
the
proceeds
of
the
sale
of
the
bonds
in
order
to
cover
the
check
and
that
is
exactly
what
they
did,
and
they
deceived
the
directors
in
that
respect.
so
i
say
that
the
court,
by
refusing
to
look
at
the
thing
in
that
sort
of
a
way,
and
by
refusing
to
connect
that
one
sale
of
government
bonds,
which
by
the
way
is
the
particulars
of
the
transaction
that
the
government
relies
on
in
this
case,
they
refused
to
look
upon
that
as
a
part
of
an
overall
scheme
and
the
other
parts
of
which
were
also
essential
to
this
scheme
and
all
of
which
should
be
considered
as
a
package,
not
as
individual
fragmented
facts.
mr.
walter
p.
north
we
separate
the
bonds
from
the
stock
only
to
the
extent
that
we
say
that
the
government
relies
on
the
bond
sale
as
the
basis
for
which
we
say
the
court
of
appeals
below
should
be
reversed.
mr.
walter
p.
north
certainly
not.
mr.
walter
p.
north
that
all,
as
long
as
we
show
that
someone
part
of
the
scheme
involved
the
purchase
or
sale
or
is
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
--.
mr.
walter
p.
north
we
say
the
stock
selling
section
was
a
part
of
the
overall
scheme.
it's
the
same
as
the
bond
sale
and
the
same
as
these
subsequent
things
they
did,
the
transactions
they
carried
out
in
the
afternoon
of
that
day
where
they
went
through
this
business
of
chasing
themselves
out
around
the
circle
and
coming
back
where
they
ended
exactly
where
they
started
from,
that
was
all
a
part
of
the
scheme
to
the
defraud.
the
reason
that
we
did
not
dwell
upon
the
sale
of
manhattan’s
own
stock
from
bankers
life
to
the
defrauders
as
a
part
of
our
case
is
because
that
runs
directly
contrary
to
birnbaum
which
says
that
the
defrauded
party
must
be
either
a
purchaser
or
a
seller,
well
of
course
manhattan
itself
did
not
sell
anything
or
buy
anything.
mr.
walter
p.
north
we
have
suggested
that
on
a
number
of
occasions,
we
have
suggested
it
in
the
second
circuit
itself.
mr.
walter
p.
north
and
we
suggested
in
this
case,
largely
just
by
a
way
of
a
footnote
that
says
that
we
have
never
agreed
to
that
theory,
but
we
realize
that
in
order
to
win
this
case
on
that
ground
you
had
to
overturn
birnbaum
whereas
you
do
not
necessarily
overturn
it
and
the
other
is
context.
incidentally
i
think
it
is
quite
significant
in
that
regard
that
judge
hayes,
who
dissented
as
one
member
of
the
three
judge
panel
who
decided
this
very
occasion
today,
he
just
flatly
would
overrule
birnbaum.
let
me
read
you
just
two
sentences,
his
opinion
is
only
a
page-and-a-half
long,
as
reprinted
in
the
appendix
on
pages
109
and
110,
just
two
sentences.
he
says
manhattan
was
the
victim
of
a
“scheme
to
defraud,”
which
is
the
language
of
the
of
rule.
since
the
vital
center
of
the
scheme,
the
vehicle
for
the
perpetration
of
the
fraud
was
the
sale
of
manhattan’s
stock,
it
seems
to
me
to
be
completely
unrealistic
to
say
that
the
fraud
was
committed
“in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
any
security.”
well,
now
judge
hayes
knows
just
as
well
as
any
of
us
here
in
the
room
do,
that
the
sale
of
manhattan's
stock
did
not
involve
manhattan
as
either
a
purchaser
or
as
a
seller.
and
he
is
saying
in
so
many
words
that
when
you
have
got
an
overall
scheme
to
defraud,
you
do
not
fragment
it
to
look
at
the
overall
scheme
and
if
any
part
of
it
was
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
securities,
that
is
the
answer.
the
answer
does
apply
in
the
question
of
whether
the
plaintiff
himself
happened
to
be
a
purchaser
or
a
seller
and
it
seems
to
me
that
anything
short
of
that
simply
overlooks
the
difference
in
wording
between
section
17
of
the
1933
act
and
section
10
(b)
and
rule
10
(b)
(5)
or
the
1934
act
because
the
one
says
it
must
be
in
connection
with
the
sale
or
as
the
other
--
the
one
says
it
must
be
in
the
sale
or
in
the
purchase,
whereas
the
other
says
that
it
has
to
be
in
connection
with
a
purchase
or
sale
by
any
person.
i
would
like
to
deal,
just
a
moment
with
this
question
of
whether
we
are
pursuing
a
purely
self
inflicted
fraud
that
really
did
not
hurt
anybody
because
mr.
begole
or
mr.
begole
and
bourne
themselves
were
the
sole
owners
of
this
corporation.
that
kind
of
a
position
of
course
overlooks
the
community
of
interest
which
a
corporation
represents
over
and
beyond
the
interest
of
the
stockholder
or
stockholder
alone.
if
you
had,
for
example
a
corporation
that
had
outstanding
bonds
or
debentures
or
other
form
of
debt
securities,
you
certainly
would
not
say
that
they
want,
that
that
interest
was
not
to
be
protected
and
likewise
the
interest
of
other
creditors
and
policy
holders
is
all
a
part
of
the
overall
community
that
the
statute
is
designed
to
present
to
protect,
not
just
to
protect
alone
the
shareholder,
who
in
this
case
was
the
sole
shareholder
who
was
the
one
who
perpetrated
the
fraud.
mr.
walter
p.
north
you
mean
under
10
(b)
(5)?
mr.
walter
p.
north
the
representative
of
the
creditor
certainly
would
have
that
right
and
here
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
is
the
superintendent
of
insurance.
mr.
walter
p.
north
pardon?
mr.
walter
p.
north
no
i
do
not
say
that,
but
i
do
not
think
that
is
the
key
thing
here.
the
key
thing
here
is
that
the
action
is
being
brought
by
the
superintendent
of
insurance
derivatively
on
behalf
of
the
corporation
which
in
turn
had
some
creditors
so
that
the
creditors
are
a
part
of
the
community
of
interest
which
is
being
protected
by
this
suit
under
10
(b)
(5).
mr.
walter
p.
north
i
do
not
know
to
what
extend
there
are
still
outstanding
unsatisfied
claims,
i
think
i
have
to
refer
that
question
maybe
to
private
counsel
but
i
do
know
that
--
mr.
walter
p.
north
in
the
process
to
whatever
extent
the
creditors
have
been
paid,
i
will
assume
that
in
the
process,
someone
else
has
been
subrogated
to
their
right.
superintendent
of
insurance
is
not
bringing
this
action
on
behalf
of
mr.
begole,
that
is
certain
and
there
is
abundant
authority
for
the
proposition
that
creditors
are
entitled
to
protection.
your
own
case
here
of
pepper
versus
litton
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
while
it
predates
the
federal
securities
laws,
makes
it
perfectly
clear
that
a
so-called
self
inflicted
fraud
by
somebody
who
controls
a
corporation
still
cannot
be
relied
upon
as
a
means
of
defeating
the
action
which
is
brought
on
behalf
of
creditors
or
anyone
who
is
dealt
with
or
contracted
with
the
corporation.
mr.
walter
p.
north
yes
something
of
that.
mr.
walter
p.
north
that
is
right,
if
that
could
be.
the
leading
case
i
think
in
this
area
that
actually
does
come
under
the
federal
securities
laws
whereas
pepper
versus
litton
just
before
the
1934
act.
the
leading
case
that
does
come
under
the
federal
securities
laws
is
the
hooper
versus
mountain
state's
case
and
in
there
it
was
plainly
held
even
though
the
corporation
itself
was
controlled
by
the
person
who
committed
the
fraud,
the
fact
did
not
mean
that
there
could
not
be
recovery
for
the
benefit
of
creditors
or
anybody
else
who
had
dealt
with
the
corporation
in
reliance
on
the
court
with
transaction
and
the
bail's
case
which
is
referred
to
here
earlier
is
to
the
same
effect
and
it
is
so
recent
that
this
does
not
even
appear
on
our
brief,
it
was
decided
since
our
brief
was
written.
and
i
think
it
is
important
in
this
connection
to
note
that
congress
at
the
very
time
it
was
drafting
this
statute
had
in
mind,
in
relation
to
insurance
companies,
the
fact
that
creditors
and
policy
holders
could
be
involved.
the
house
report,
i
am
paraphrasing
or
quoting
now
on
facts
away
from
the
footnote
in
page
27
of
our
brief,
the
house
report
on
the
bill
which
became
the
1934
act
noted
that
over
15
million
individuals
hold
insurance
policies,
the
values
of
which
is
dependent
upon
the
security
holdings
of
insurance
companies.
that
is
quoted
exactly
from
the
house
report.
the
senate
report
went
on
to
observe
that
the
current
value
of
securities
held
by
insurance
companies
and
consequently
the
welfare
of
the
countless
individuals
who
have
a
financial
interest
in
such
institutions
is
directly
effected
by
the
activities,
he
is
talking
now
about
his
activities
in
the
trading
and
sale
of
securities.
so
while
it
can
be
said
that
congress
was
not
perhaps
directly
concerned
with
creditors
and
policy
holders
as
such
to
the
extent
that
part
of
the
community
of
interest
that
makes
up
an
insurance
company
is
creditors
and
policy
holders
that
is
a
part
of
what
congress
was
directing
itself
to
when
it
enacted
the
anti
fraud
provisions
of
the
1934
act.
mr.
walter
p.
north
well
that
would
be
a
little
harder
case
but
--
mr.
walter
p.
north
i
would
not
be
prepared
to
conceive
if
there
would
not
be
a
10
(b)
(5)
action
even
under
those
circumstances,
but
this
case
is
much
stronger
than
that
because
there
was
a
pre-conceived
plan
or
scheme
to
do
this
very
thing
and
the
sale
of
the
securities
was
a
part
of
that
scheme.
mr.
walter
p.
north
that
is
a
part
of
the
type
of
reasoning
of
the
court
below
used
in
this
case,
but
as
long
as
you
maintain
the
integrity
of
the
requirement
that
the
fraud
be
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
securities.
there
is
certainly
no
danger
that
that
federal
securities
laws
is
going
to
take
over
the
whole
field
of
the
corporate
mismanagement
and
looting,
and
everything
else
whereas
securities
transactions
are
not
involved.
the
securities
transaction
must
still
be
a
part
of
the
fraudulent
scheme
in
order
for
the
(voice
overlap)
mr.
walter
p.
north
mr.
justice
white
i
assume
you
are
talking
now
about
the
requirement
that
the
plaintiff
himself
be
a
purchaser
or
a
seller.
i
think
that
the
requirement
of
the
purchaser
or
seller
himself
or
the
plaintiff
himself
be
a
purchaser
or
seller
can
be
done
away
with
and
still
not
make
this
federal
securities
laws
and
the
fraud
provision,
an
undue
incursion
upon
the
state
law
of
fraud,
as
long
as
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale.
that
is
why
i
would
say
that
even
this
initial
sale
of
all
of
manhattan's
stock
to
begole
should
come
within
the
purview
of
this
and
would,
in
some
other
circuits
though
obviously
it
cannot
in
the
second
circuit
unless
and
until
the
birnbaum
case
is
overruled.
mr.
walter
p.
north
i
believe
it
is,
your
honor
and
i
am
sorry
if
i
ran
over.
thank
you
very
much.
