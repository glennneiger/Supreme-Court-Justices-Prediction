are
those

justice

white
the

of
the

have
been

would
not
that
be

so
you
look
at

and
you
go,
the
(voice

never
gets
the

justice
byron
r.
white
it
does
not
court
of
appeals
think
that
perhaps
the
securities
laws,
what
intended
just
to
cover
ordinary
fraud
by
director
and

and
it
would
be
difficult
to
contain
the
