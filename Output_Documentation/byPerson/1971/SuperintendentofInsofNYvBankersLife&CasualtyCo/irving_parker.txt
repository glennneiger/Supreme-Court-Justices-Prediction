mr.
irving
parker
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
principally
in
the
interest
of
respondent
bankers
life
and
casualty
company
as
to
whom
the
facts
and
the
proceedings
in
this
case
are
unique.
however,
this
court
may
interpret
section
10
(b)
of
the
1934
act
and
rule
10
(b)
(5)
promulgated
there
under,
petitioner
has
not
and
he
cannot
state
a
claim
for
which
relief
can
be
granted
against
bankers
life.
neither
the
complaint
itself
nor
the
complaint
supplemented
by
a
comprehensive
discovery
record
provides
a
single,
factual
allegation
which
in
any
respect
supports
any
claim
against
bankers
life.
the
only
conceivable
reason
that
bankers
life
was
made
a
party
to
the
action
and
is
here
today
is
that
it
happened
to
own
the
stock
of
manhattan
casualty
company
and
sold
it
in
january
1962
after
months
of
negotiations.
the
sale
was
arms
length
and
the
only
conclusion
which
the
record
permits
is
that
the
sale
was
free
from
any
impropriety
in
any
respect
whatsoever
on
the
part
of
bankers
life.
in
november
1963,
shortly
after
the
action
was
commenced
and
the
insurance
department
had
completed
a
lengthy
investigation
into
the
circumstances
which
led
to
the
liquidation
of
manhattan,
the
petitioner,
the
superintendent
of
insurance,
as
liquidator
of
manhattan
was
deposed.
upon
deposition,
the
essence
of
the
petitioner's
testimony
was
that
he
could
not
assert
any
facts
to
justify
inclusion
of
bankers
life
as
a
party
in
any
way
connected
with
any
of
the
alleged
wrongs
upon
which
the
action
was
based.
the
other
speculative
basis
upon
which
bankers
life
was
named
a
party
was
clearly
revealed
by
the
petitioner's
testimonial
admission
that
he
could
not
factually
support
any
claim
against
bankers
life
and
to
attempt
to
do
so,
he
required
an
opportunity
to
conduct
discovery
proceedings
and
so
petitioner
proceeded
to
discover.
by
early
1968,
petitioner
concluded
some
four
and
one
half
years
of
discovery.
mr.
irving
parker
yes
your
honor,
in
this
case.
through
his
attorneys,
petitioner
deposed
almost
40
witnesses
and
a
master
record
of
some
12000
pages
of
transcript
and
hundreds
of
documents,
but
petitioner
still
could
not
provide
a
simple
factual
allegation
to
justify
retention
of
bankers
life
as
a
party
for
the
action.
consequently--
mr.
irving
parker
your
honor,
it
goes
to
this
jurisdictional
question.
mr.
irving
parker
there
are,
your
honor
and
the
fact
to
the
matter
is,
your
honor
--
mr.
irving
parker
no
your
honor,
there
is
precedent
for
what
i
am
contending
for
here
and
i
will
come
to
that,
your
honor.
in
any
event,
in
april
1968,
bankers
life
moved
before
the
district
court
for
summary
judgment
pursuant
to
rule
56,
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
trivial
issue
of
fact
as
to
bankers
life
and
it
was
entitled
to
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law.
bankers
life
was
the
only
defendant
who
so
moved.
when
the
motion
was
made,
the
petitioner
indicated
his
need
for,
and
he
obtained
sufficient
time
within
which
to
search
the
discovery
record
in
the
hope
that
he
could
find
something
upon
which
to
base
an
opposition
to
that
motion.
the
motion
was
heard
upon
extensive
and
comprehensive
affidavits
before
judge
sylvester
ryan,
who
found
that
petitioner
had
no
way
charged
that
bankers
life
had
participated
in
the
negotiations
for
the
raising
of
the
purchase
price
for
the
manhattan
stock
or
even
that
bankers
life
had
any
knowledge
of
those
negotiations
and
judge
ryan's
exact
words
are
at
page
42
a
of
the
appendix.
nevertheless,
judge
ryan
denied
the
summary
judgment
motion,
but
he
did
so
expressly
stating
that
it
was
not
on
the
merits
and
it
was
without
prejudice
and
he
explained
that
he
could
not
dispose
of
the
motion
because
of
the
need
first
to
determine
petitioner's
questionable
claim
of
federal
jurisdiction
and
so
the
motions
to
dismiss
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
were
made
and
it
is
as
a
result
of
the
dismissal
of
the
complaint
and
its
affirmance
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
respondents
who
made
such
motions
are
here.
as
to
bankers
life,
it
simply
is
not
involved
in
the
questions
presented
whether
there
was
schemes
or
devices
employed
by
others
in
connection
with
any
transactions
complained
of
by
the
petitioner
or
relied
upon
by
the
sec.
the
absence
of
any
connection
of
bankers
life
with
any
schemes
or
devices
was
confirmed
by
petitioner's
attorney
in
open
court
as
long
ago
as
november
1963,
first
referring
to
the
fact
of
the
sale
of
the
manhattan
stock,
petitioner's
attorney
describing
his
claim
stated
and
i
quote,
“thereafter
the
complaint
alleges
that
defendants,
other
than
mr.
parker's
client,
namely
bankers
life,
entered
into
a
scheme
to
cover
up
this
depletion
of
corporate
assets
which
was
successful
for
about
a
year-and-a-half.”
since
the
time
that
statement
was
made,
petitioner
has
been
unable
to
alter
the
admitted
lack
of
any
connection
between
any
of
the
transactions
complained
of
in
bankers
life.
the
conclusion
set
forth
at
page
37
of
petitioner's
main
brief,
plainly
evidences
that
the
heart
of
his
purported
federal
claim
is
based
upon
the
circumstances
of
the
sale
of
the
manhattan
government
bonds
and
the
misappropriation
of
the
proceeds
of
that
sale
with
none
of
which
bankers
life
had
any
connection
whatsoever.
these
transactions
occurred
after
the
purchaser
had
acquired
the
stock,
had
taken
control
of
the
company
and
had
installed
a
board
of
directors.
it
was
petitioner's
own
analysis
of
his
complaint,
supplemented
by
the
extensive
discovery
record,
which
led
judge
ryan
to
the
conclusion
that
i
have
mentioned
before,
namely,
that
there
was
no
charge
in
this
entire
record,
whatsoever
made,
that
bankers
life
participated
in
or
even
had
any
knowledge
of
the
transactions
relating
to
the
raising
of
the
purchase
price
for
the
manhattan
stock.
the
absence
of
any
basis
for
asserting
any
federal
claim
against
bankers
life
is
also
confirmed
by
petitioner's
reply
brief.
first,
as
to
the
brief
of
bankers
life;
the
principal
point
of
the
brief
of
bankers
life
is
that
no
federal
claim
has
been
asserted
against
bankers
life
and
that
federal
jurisdiction
does
not
exist
as
to
it.
mr.
irving
parker
in
30
seconds
i
will
answer
your
question,
if
i
may
your
honor.
thank
you.
as
to
the
petitioner's
reply
brief,
he
has
not,
in
any
respect
controverted
this
inescapable
conclusion
that
there
is
no
federal
jurisdiction
as
to
bankers
life
or
that
dismissal
of
the
complaint
was
unquestionably
correct
as
to
bankers
life.
nevertheless,
we
believe
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed
in
all
respects.
we
believe
further
that
in
any
event,
that
judgment
should
certainly
be
affirmed
as
to
bankers
life.
when
the
court
of
appeals
sir,
and
i
think
i
can
anticipate
your
question
because
i
will
not
overlook
it,
when
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
was
presented
with
a
similar
situation,
involving
multiple
defendants
in
schoenbaum
against
firstbrook
which
is
reported
at
405,
f.
2nd
at
215,
a
case
involving
rule
10
(b)
(5),
a
case
which
was
heard
en
banc,
that
court
affirmed
dismissal
of
the
complaint
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
in
respect
of
that
single
defendant
as
to
whom
there
was
no
showing
made
of
any
participation
in
the
wrongs
complained
of.
mr.
irving
parker
dividing
bankers
life
from
the
others,
there
was
no
occasion
for
them
to
do
it
your
honor.
i
think
as
the
court
of
appeals
saw
it
--
mr.
irving
parker
and
i
think
they
were
correct
about
that
your
honor
and
i
think
they
are
correct.
mr.
irving
parker
that
there
was
federal
jurisdiction
in
some
form
as
to
some
parties,
they
still,
i
would
think
and
i
think
that
on
the
basis
of
schaunbaum
and
firstbrook,
the
court
of
appeals
would
certainly
have
dismissed
this
to
us.
mr.
irving
parker
i
do
not
see
if
there
is
any
need
for
it,
your
honor.
mr.
irving
parker
well,
i
think
on
the
basis
of
the
briefs
alone
that
will
appear
your
honor.
i
would
not
expect
the
court
to
be
troubled
(voice
overlap).
mr.
irving
parker
there
are
12,000
and
i
would
not
expect
the
court
to
be
troubled
by
that,
but
i
respectfully
submit,
your
honor
that
on
the
basis
of
the
briefs
alone,
this
will
appear
because
the
facts
are
there,
they
are
uncontroverted
and
i
think
whether
it
is
most
important
of
all,
your
honor
--
mr.
irving
parker
as
he
concede
what
i
say?
i
have
not
asked
him,
your
honor
and
i
do
not
know.
we
respectfully
submit
your
honor
that
what
is
before
your
honors
and
what
your
honors
will
be
willing
to
consider,
that
you
will
see
that
there
has
been
a
grave
injustice
committed
here
in
respect
of
bankers
life
and
that
the
only
way
left
to
remedy
the
injustice
of
having
made
bankers
life
a
party
to
an
action
in
which
it
does
not
belong
is
to
affirm
dismissal
of
the
complaint
as
to
if,
and
thereby
in
some
measure,
offset
the
effects
of
the
unworthy
challenge
to
the
integrity
of
bankers
life
in
connection
with
a
perfectly
proper
sale
of
the
manhattan
stock
which
it
made.
thank
you
very
much,
your
honors.
mr.
irving
parker
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
principally
in
the
interest
of
respondent
bankers
life
and
casualty
company
as
to
whom
the
facts
and
the
proceedings
in
this
case
are
unique.
however,
this
court
may
interpret
section
10
(b)
of
the
1934
act
and
rule
10
(b)
(5)
promulgated
there
under,
petitioner
has
not
and
he
cannot
state
a
claim
for
which
relief
can
be
granted
against
bankers
life.
neither
the
complaint
itself
nor
the
complaint
supplemented
by
a
comprehensive
discovery
record
provides
a
single,
factual
allegation
which
in
any
respect
supports
any
claim
against
bankers
life.
the
only
conceivable
reason
that
bankers
life
was
made
a
party
to
the
action
and
is
here
today
is
that
it
happened
to
own
the
stock
of
manhattan
casualty
company
and
sold
it
in
january
1962
after
months
of
negotiations.
the
sale
was
arms
length
and
the
only
conclusion
which
the
record
permits
is
that
the
sale
was
free
from
any
impropriety
in
any
respect
whatsoever
on
the
part
of
bankers
life.
in
november
1963,
shortly
after
the
action
was
commenced
and
the
insurance
department
had
completed
a
lengthy
investigation
into
the
circumstances
which
led
to
the
liquidation
of
manhattan,
the
petitioner,
the
superintendent
of
insurance,
as
liquidator
of
manhattan
was
deposed.
upon
deposition,
the
essence
of
the
petitioner's
testimony
was
that
he
could
not
assert
any
facts
to
justify
inclusion
of
bankers

as
a

in
any
way
connected
with
any
of
the
alleged
wrongs
upon
which
the

the

a

was
clearly
revealed
by
the

admission
that

by

petitioner
concluded
some
four

one
half
years
of
discovery.
mr.
irving
parker
yes
your
honor,
in
this
case.
through
his
attorneys,
petitioner
deposed
almost
40
witnesses
and
a
master
record
of
some
12000
pages
of
transcript
and
hundreds
of
documents,
but
petitioner
still
could
not
provide
a
simple
factual
allegation
to
justify
retention
of
bankers
life
as
a
party
for
the
action.
consequently--
mr.
irving
parker
your
honor,
it
goes
to
this
jurisdictional
question.
mr.
irving
parker
there
are,
your
honor
and
the
fact
to
the
matter
is,
your
honor
--
mr.
irving
parker
no
your
honor,
there
is
precedent
for
what
i
am
contending
for
here
and
i
will
come
to
that,
your
honor.
in
any
event,
in
april
1968,
bankers
life
moved
before
the
district
court
for
summary
judgment
pursuant
to
rule
56,
on

and
it
was

as

of
law.
bankers
life
was
the
only
defendant
who
so
moved.
when
the
motion
was
made,
the
petitioner
indicated
his
need
for,
and
he
obtained
sufficient
time
within
which
to
search
the
discovery
record
in
the
hope
that
he
could
find
something
upon
which
to
base
an
opposition
to
that
motion.
the
motion
was
heard
upon
extensive
and
comprehensive
affidavits
before
judge
sylvester
ryan,
who
found
that
petitioner
had
no
way
charged
that
bankers
life
had
participated
in
the
negotiations
for
the
raising
of
the
purchase
price

had
any

of
those
negotiations
and
judge
ryan's
exact
words
are

nevertheless,
judge
ryan
denied
the
summary
judgment
motion,
but
he
did
so
expressly
stating
that
it
was
not
on
the

and
it
was
without

he
explained
that
he
could
not
dispose
of
the

because
of
the
need
first
to
determine
petitioner's
questionable
claim
of
federal
jurisdiction
and
so
the
motions
to
dismiss
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
were
made
and
it
is
as
a
result
of
the
dismissal
of
the
complaint
and
its
affirmance
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
respondents
who
made
such
motions
are
here.
as
to
bankers
life,
it
simply
is
not
involved
in
the
questions
presented
whether
there
was
schemes
or
devices
employed
by
others
in
connection
with
any
transactions
complained
of
by
the
petitioner
or
relied
upon
by
the
sec.
the
absence
of
any
connection
of
bankers
life
with
any
schemes
or
devices
was
confirmed
by
petitioner's
attorney
in
open
court
as
long
ago
as
november
1963,
first
referring
to
the
fact
of
the
sale
of
the
manhattan
stock,
petitioner's
attorney
describing
his
claim
stated
and
i
quote,
“thereafter
the
complaint
alleges
that
defendants,
other
than
mr.
parker's
client,
namely
bankers
life,
entered
into
a
scheme
to
cover
up
this
depletion
of
corporate
assets
which
was
successful
for
about
a
year-and-a-half.”
since
the
time
that
statement
was
made,
petitioner
has
been
unable
to
alter
the
admitted
lack
of
any
connection
between
any
of
the
transactions
complained
of
in
bankers
life.
the
conclusion
set
forth
at
page
37
of
petitioner's
main

plainly
evidences
that
the
heart
of
his
purported
federal

upon
the

bonds
and
the
misappropriation
of
the
proceeds
of
that
sale
with
none
of
which
bankers
life
had
any
connection
whatsoever.
these
transactions
occurred
after
the
purchaser
had
acquired
the
stock,
had
taken
control
of
the
company
and
had
installed
a
board
of
directors.
it
was
petitioner's
own
analysis
of
his
complaint,
supplemented
by
the
extensive
discovery
record,
which
led
judge
ryan
to
the
conclusion
that
i
have
mentioned
before,
namely,
that
there
was
no
charge
in
this
entire
record,
whatsoever
made,
that
bankers
life
participated
in
or
even
had
any
knowledge
of
the
transactions
relating
to
the
raising
of
the
purchase
price
for
the
manhattan
stock.
the
absence
of
any
basis
for
asserting
any
federal
claim
against
bankers
life
is
also
confirmed
by
petitioner's
reply
brief.
first,
as
to
the
brief
of
bankers
life;
the
principal
point
of
the
brief
of
bankers
life
is
that
no
federal
claim
has
been
asserted
against
bankers
life
and
that
federal
jurisdiction
does
not
exist
as
to
it.
mr.
irving
parker
in
30
seconds
i
will
answer
your
question,
if
i
may
your
honor.
thank
you.
as
to
the
petitioner's
reply
brief,
he
has
not,
in
any
respect
controverted
this
inescapable
conclusion
that
there
is
no
federal
jurisdiction
as
to
bankers
life
or
that
dismissal
of
the
complaint
was
unquestionably
correct
as
to
bankers
life.
nevertheless,
we
believe
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed
in
all
respects.
we
believe
further
that
in
any
event,
that
judgment
should
certainly
be
affirmed
as
to
bankers
life.
when
the
court
of
appeals
sir,
and
i
think
i
can
anticipate
your
question
because
i
will
not
overlook
it,
when
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
was
presented
with
a
similar
situation,
involving
multiple
defendants
in
schoenbaum
against
firstbrook
which
is
reported
at
405,
f.
2nd
at
215,
a
case
involving
rule
10
(b)
(5),
a
case
which
was
heard
en
banc,
that
court
affirmed
dismissal
of
the
complaint
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
in
respect
of
that
single
defendant
as
to
whom
there
was
no
showing
made
of
any
participation
in
the
wrongs
complained
of.
mr.
irving
parker
dividing
bankers
life
from
the
others,
there
was
no
occasion
for
them
to
do
it
your
honor.
i
think
as
the
court
of
appeals
saw
it
--
mr.
irving
parker
and
i
think
they
were
correct
about
that
your
honor
and
i
think
they
are
correct.
mr.
irving
parker
that
there
was
federal
jurisdiction
in
some
form
as
to
some
parties,
they
still,
i
would
think
and
i
think
that
on
the
basis
of
schaunbaum
and
firstbrook,
the
court
of
appeals
would
certainly
have
dismissed
this
to
us.
mr.
irving
parker
i
do
not
see
if
there
is
any
need
for
it,
your
honor.
mr.
irving
parker
well,
i
think
on
the
basis
of
the
briefs
alone
that
will
appear
your
honor.
i
would
not
expect
the
court
to
be
troubled
(voice
overlap).
mr.
irving
parker
there
are
12,000
and
i
would
not
expect
the
court
to
be
troubled
by
that,
but
i
respectfully
submit,
your
honor
that
on
the
basis
of
the
briefs
alone,
this
will
appear
because
the
facts
are
there,
they
are
uncontroverted
and
i
think
whether
it
is
most
important
of
all,
your
honor
--
mr.
irving
parker
as
he
concede
what
i
say?
i
have
not
asked
him,
your
honor
and
i
do
not
know.
we
respectfully
submit
your
honor
that
what
is
before
your
honors
and
what
your
honors
will
be
willing
to
consider,
that
you
will
see
that
there
has
been
a
grave
injustice
committed
here
in
respect
of
bankers
life
and
that
the
only
way
left
to
remedy
the
injustice
of
having
made
bankers
life
a
party
to
an
action
in
which
it
does
not
belong
is
to
affirm
dismissal
of
the
complaint
as
to
if,
and
thereby
in
some
measure,
offset
the
effects
of
the
unworthy
challenge
to
the
integrity
of
bankers
life
in
connection
with
a
perfectly
proper
sale
of
the
manhattan
stock
which
it
made.
thank
you
very
much,
your
honors.
