mr.

i
take
it
for
(inaudible)
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
would
like
that.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
why
is
it
so
important
to
you
though
to
be
in
the
state
court
rather
than
in
the
federal
court?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
karatz,
do
you
represent
irving
trust?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
did
irving
trust
did
all
of
these
deals,
some
kind
of
a
fee
for
this
five
million
dollar
check?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
i
understand
that
manhattan
had
maintained
an
account
with
irving?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
when
the
hundred
and
fifty
thousand,
plus
or
minus
check
came
in?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
this
is
all
a
brand
new
account
on
irving's
books?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
karatz,
i
come
back
to
my
question,
what
real
difference
does
it
make
to
irving
trust
company
whether
this
litigation
is
resolved
on
the
state
side
or
the
federal
side?
what
is
it
that
you
fear
to,
in
being
brought
on
to
the
federal
umbrella
at
this
point?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
would
have
you
answer
it
because
i
think
before
the
only
answer
you
gave
me
was
because
you
were
reluctant
to
clogging
the
federal
court
calendars?
justice
