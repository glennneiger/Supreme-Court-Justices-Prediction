mr.
william
w.
karatz
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
plaintiff's
basic
contention
here
is
that
a
claim
under
the
federal
securities
laws
is
stated
because
manhattan's
sole
shareholder
misappropriated
manhattan's
funds
insofar
as
the
proceeds
from
the
sale
of
manhattan's
bonds
were
concerned.
there
are
at
least
two
reasons
why
plaintiff
is
wrong
in
asserting
that
manhattan
has
any
claim
under
federal
law
in
connection
with
this
transaction.
first,
there
was
no
deception
of
or
damage
to
manhattan
because
manhattan's
sole
shareholder
knew
of,
participated
in,
benefited
from
and
fully
ratified
the
allegedly
fraudulent
transaction.
since
manhattan,
by
way
of
its
sole
shareholder
could
not
have
been
deceived,
suffered
no
damage,
there
was
no
federal
fraud
in
connection
with
the
sale
of
any
security,
either
the
manhattan
bonds
or
anything
else.
now,
mr.
bowman
and
mr.
north
have
suggested
that
there
is
something
to
a
corporation
other
than
its
shareholders.
i
would
suggest
that
it
is
standard
corporate
law
that
when
shareholders
fully
ratify
the
action
taken
by
a
corporation,
that
becomes
corporate
action.
now,
it
may
be
that
such
action
would
constitute
a
fraud
on
creditors,
as
long
established
common
law
in
this
area.
if
corporate
insiders
by
their
actions
with
regard
to
the
corporation
in
someway
damage
creditors,
creditors
have
remedies
at
common
law
and
by
statute
in
all
of
the
states.
they
have
remedies
by
way
of
an
action
for
fraudulent
conveyance.
they
have
actions
by
way
of,
an
action
for
illegal
dividend.
there
was
no
need
for
congress
to
provide
creditor
remedies.
those
remedies
already
were
available
to
creditors
and
i
suggest
that
if
you
have
sole
stockholder
approval
of
an
action,
certainly
under
federal
law
and
in
federal
securities
law,
there
can
be
no
fraud
on
the
corporation.
mr.
william
w.
karatz
your
honor,
if
i
may
be
very
frank
about
the
reason
why
we
are
here
today,
and
quite
frankly
i
am
glad
i
am
here
today
because
i
think
this
is
an
important
issue
of
law
because
chief
judge
ryan
invited
the
defendants
to
make
a
motion
to
dismiss.
if
i
may
tell
you
quite
frankly
what
tactics
of
defense
counsel
was
on
this
case,
we
were
going
to
take
it
through
the
trial
in
the
federal
courts
and
then
get
the
case
dismissed,
because
we
did
not
think
that
there
was
a
federal
claim
here.
we
went
all
the
way
through
years
of
pre-trial
discovery,
thousands
of
pages
of
testimonies,
hundreds
of
documents.
chief
judge
ryan,
when
mr.
parker
made
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
refused
to
decide
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
on
its
merits,
stating
that
in
his
view,
the
complaint
did
not
spell
out
a
claim
and
suggested
to
counsel
that
a
motion
to
dismiss
be
made,
because
he
felt
that
this
was
not
a
federal
action
and
that
the
federal
courts
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
should
not
have
to
go
through
a
trial
that
will
take
weeks,
if
not
months.
we
made
that
motion
to
dismiss,
pursuant
to
the
suggestion
of
judge
ryan
and
we
were
sustained
in
our
relief
all
the
way
up
to
this
court
that
there
is
no
federal
claim
here.
now,
in
response
to
judge
blackmun's
question
as
to
why
we
prefer
to
be
in
the
state
courts,
we
do
not
necessarily
prefer
to
be
in
the
state
courts,
your
honor.
we
just
feel
that
that
is
the
place
where
we
should
be
because
of
the
state
of
the
law
and
i
might
say
that
as
a
member
of
the
bar
of
new
york,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
calendar
of
the
southern
district
should
be
clogged
with
10
(b)
(5)
cases
as
it
is
today
which
do
not
rightfully
belong
there.
the
second
reason
why
plaintiff
is
wrong
in
asserting
that
there
has
been
an
injury
to
manhattan
in
connection
with
the
purchases
or
sale
of
the
security
is
that
this
case
does
not
involve
any
impurity
in
any
security
transaction.
as
the
courts
below
concluded,
there
can
be
no
fraud
in
connection
with
a
security
transaction
when
none
of
the
following
three
facts
are
involved.
first,
this
case
does
not
involve
the
purchase
or
sale
of
any
security
for
more
or
less
than
its
fair
market
value.
second,
this
case
does
not
involve
any
actual
or
potential
manipulation
or
abuse
of
the
trading
process.
third,
this
case
does
not
involve
any
injury
to
any
manhattan
shareholder
or
to
any
other
member
of
the
investing
public.
what
this
case
does
involve,
your
honors,
is
a
claim
that
defendant
begole,
the
sole
shareholder
of
manhattan,
misappropriated
manhattan
funds
for
his
own
benefits
and
that
this
misappropriation
was
not
reported
to
the
superintendent
of
insurance
of
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
william
w.
karatz
yes
sir.
mr.
william
w.
karatz
now,
quite
frankly,
your
honor,
irving
received
no
fee
for
the
five
--
let
me
break
up
the
checks.
the
first
five
million
dollar
check,
the
one
payable
to
bankers
life
and
casualty
company
which
constituted
the
payment
by
mr.
begole
for
a
stock,
was
delivered
by
the
irving
officer
to
the
bankers
life
representative
at
the
closing
as
a
convenience
to
mr.
garvin
who
was
one
of
the
leading
members
of
the
new
york
brokerage
community.
mr.
garvin’s
house
was
well
recognized
as
a
leader
in
the
area
of
government
bonds,
securities
and
certificates
of
deposit.
i
might
say
that
the
way
business
is
done
on
wall
street
is
by
requests
being
made
by
people
who
are
respected
and
those
requests
being
honored.
millions
of
dollars
of
businesses
done
everyday
by
all
of
the
leading
banks
in
new
york
city
on
word
of
mouth,
without
any
paper
being
transferred.
mr.
garvin
came
to
mr.
gunter,
who
is
an
assistant
secretary
of
irving
trust
company,
who
had
known
mr.
garvin
for
years,
who
had
known
his
brokerage
house
for
years
and
requested
that
five
million
dollars
be
given
in
return
for
funds
which
would
be
returned
to
irving
the
same
day.
it
was
convenience
to
mr.
garvin.
it
was
something
which
is
not
unusual
in
the
wall
street
community.
mr.
william
w.
karatz
the
second
check,
your
honor,
let
me
say
how
that
came
about.
after
the
first
transaction,
namely
the
closing
at
manhattan
had
taken
place,
mr.
gunter
got
back
to
the
bank.
he
received
a
telephone
call
from
mr.
garvin
and
he
said
that
there
was
a
second
half
to
the
transaction.
mr.
gunter
replied
to
mr.
garvin
and
this
is
all
in
testimony
in
pretrial
discovery,
i
was
not
aware
of
any
second
half
of
the
transaction
and
mr.
garvin
just
said,
well,
this
is
just
a
simple
check
swap
which
is
going
to
take
place
at
belgian-american
bank,
there
you
will
give
five
million
dollars
and
you
will
get
back
five
million
dollars.
mr.
gunter,
under
those
circumstances
did
not
feel
that
there
was
any
reason
why
he
should
not
go
along
with
the
request
to
this
respected
member
of
the
broker’s
community
and
did
so.
mr.
william
w.
karatz
no
sir.
there
was
an
attempt
to
indicate
to
the
court
that
there
was
a
nice,
clean
cut
arrangement
whereby
you
had
a
morning
transaction
and
an
afternoon
transaction.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
not
that
simple
and
i
would
refer
your
honors
for
a
detail
in
statement
of
them
to
the
appendix
in
my
brief
where
we
do
try
to
take
you
step
by
step
through
these
complex
transactions.
in
response
to
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice
brennan,
when
mr.
gunter
went
to
belgian-american
in
the
afternoon,
the
government
bonds
of
manhattan
had
not
yet
been
sold.
certainly,
the
amount
for
which
they
were
sold
had
not
yet
been
indicated.
the
way
that
this
operated
was
that
the
government
bond
transaction,
the
sale
of
government
bonds
was
a
private
transaction
between
manhattan
casualty
and
second
district
securities,
a
large
bond
house
in
new
york.
the
bonds
were
gradually
delivered
to
second
district
and
notices
came
for
second
district,
during
the
course
of
the
day
and
on
into
the
evening
as
to
the
amount
which
was
being
paid
for
the
bonds,
that
the
amount
being
paid
for
the
bonds
depended
on
the
going
rate
for
those
bonds
at
that
particular
time
of
delivery.
so,
during
the
entire
course
of
the
day,
afternoon
and
into
the
evening,
and
i
might
say
that
mr.
gunter’s
responsibilities
was
in
the
security
clearance
division
on
the
bank,
the
securities
clearance
division
has
to
do
with
receipt
of
securities
and
payment
for
securities
and
literally,
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
of
transactions
are
dealt
with
everyday
by
irving
trust
company
alone
in
this
particular
division
of
the
bank.
so
when
mr.
gunter
went
home
that
evening,
which
was,
as
i
recall
the
testimony
in
the
pretrial,
eight
or
nine
o’clock,
he
still
was
not
sure
exactly
how
much
had
been
received
for
the
securities
during
the
course
of
the
day.
i
might
also
say
that
and
as
i
have
been
pointed
out
to
your
honors,
the
bonds
ultimately
produced
only
$4,800,000
odd
dollars.
a
$150,000.00
check
of
manhattan
drawn
on
another
bank
was
delivered
to
irving
sometime
during
the
late
afternoon
of
january
24.
that
check
was
payable
to
the
order
of
manhattan
casualty
company
and
that
check
constituted
a
credit
to
manhattan's
account
at
irving
and
in
fact
that
is
exactly
what
form
it
took,
the
manhattan
check,
drawn
in
another
bank,
payable
to
itself
for
$150,000.00,
was
credited
to
manhattan's
account
at
irving.
mr.
william
w.
karatz
i
deny
that
sir,
they
were
not
false
entries.
the
entries
which
remained
at
irving
were
corrected
when
mr.
gunter
came
to
understand
what
he
thought
the
true
situation
was,
if
i
may
sir,
go
into
mr.
gunter's
examination
before
trial.
mr.
gunter
originally
was
led
to
believe
by
mr.
garvin
that
the
morning
check
for
five
million
dollars
would
be
covered
by
a
receipt
by
irving
trust
later
on
in
the
day
of
securities
which
would
be
sold
and
the
proceeds
applied
to
cover
the
five
million
dollar
check.
mr.
william
w.
karatz
no,
sold
by
manhattan,
to
second
district.
they
would
just
be
delivered
to
irving
for
purposes
of
redelivery
to
the
purchase
of
the
bonds.
mr.
gunter
was
also
informed,
as
i
mentioned
in
reply
to
an
earlier
question
that
the
second
transaction,
the
second
five
million
dollar
transaction
was
just
a
check
swap.
now
it
turned
out,
however,
that
when
the
documentation
of
what
had
gone
on
during
the
course
of
the
day
started
to
come
into
the
bank
and
it
started
to
come
in
on
january
24,
mr.
gunter
gathered
that
he
had
misunderstood
what
the
true
situation
was
and
made
the
entries
which
complied
with
the
written
instructions
which
he
was
receiving
from
various
people.
now,
what
were
the
written
instructions?
mr.
gunter
received
sometime
during
the
course
of
the
day
on
january
24,
a
letter
from
manhattan
casualty
company
signed
by
mr.
sweeny
as
president
of
manhattan,
instructing
irving
to
transfer
five
million
dollars
from
manhattan's
account
at
irving
to
belgian-american.
now,
this
was
duly
signed
by
a
representative
of
manhattan
casualty
whose
name
appeared
on
irving's
books
as
an
authorized
signatory
for
the
manhattan
account
which
was
also
opened
on
that
january
24.
mr.
william
w.
karatz
no,
manhattan
opened
an
account
on
the
very
day.
mr.
william
w.
karatz
that
is
certainly
was
one
of
the
first
items
in
it
sir.
mr.
william
w.
karatz
well
let
me
say
this
mr.
justice
brennan,
oh
i
am
sorry,
blackmun,
it
is
a
new
account
as
of
january
24,
but
manhattan
casualty
had
been
a
customer
of
irving
in
years
past.
they
were
not
a
customer
as
of
january
24,
but
it
was
not
really
a
new
customer,
it
was
just
a
renewal
of
an
old
relationship.
to
go
back
to
justice
douglas’
question,
when
mr.
gunter,
at
the
end
of
the
business
day
or
early
the
next
day,
because
as
i
say
he
did
not
leave
the
bank
because
of
the
rush
of
business
until
late
in
the
evening,
saw
this
letter
from
mr.
sweeny.
he
recognized
the
afternoon
transaction
as
having
been
a
transfer
of
manhattan
funds
to
belgian-american,
a
transfer
which
should
be
debited
to
the
manhattan
account
at
irving
and
that
is
exactly
what
he
did.
so
--
mr.
william
w.
karatz
as
of
that
time,
your
honor,
well
i
am
sorry
mr.
justice
marshall,
as
of
which
time?
mr.
william
w.
karatz
well,
when
all
--
let
me
say
at
the
time
that
he
credited
the
--
well
i
am
sorry,
when
he
debited
or
credited,
sir?
i
mean
which
item
are
we
talking
about?
mr.
william
w.
karatz
well,
okay.
let
me
tell
you
the
history
of
the
situation
as
so
far
as
irving
is
concerned.
mr.
william
w.
karatz
when
irving
issued
the
five
million
dollar
afternoon
check,
mr.
gunther
of
course
did
not
know
that
he
was
supposed
to
be
doing
this,
pursuing
to
the
instructions
of
manhattan.
at
that
time,
he
was
acting
pursuant
to
these
oral
instructions
of
mr.
garvin
saying
that
this
was
the
second
half
of
the
transaction.
by
the
time
he
saw
the
letter
from
mr.
sweeny,
instructing
the
five
million
dollar
transaction
to
take
place
in
the
afternoon
of
january
24,
manhattan
had
credited
to
its
account
the
$4,800,000
proceeds
from
the
sale
of
the
securities
plus
the
$150,000.00
check.
mr.
william
w.
karatz
no
but
the
bookkeeping
entries
were
actually
made
on
january
25th
as
of
january
24th
by
the
time
they
caught
up
with
the
–
mr.
william
w.
karatz
well
no
sir,
actually,
at
the
time
the
bookkeeping
entries
were
made,
the
money
in
fact
was
there.
when--(voice
overlap).
mr.
william
w.
karatz
no,
i
am
talking
about
the
entries,
sir
to
the
manhattan
account.
mr.
william
w.
karatz
no,
the
entries
to
the
manhattan
account
were
made
on
january
25
as
of
january
24,
at
which
time
they
were
able
to
catch
up
with
all
of
the
business
which
had
accumulated
during
the
day
and
your
honor,
once
again,
i
have
to
emphasize
that
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
department
of
a
bank
which
has
literally
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
of
transactions
everyday,
this
is
not
an
isolated
situation.
mr.
william
w.
karatz
pardon?
mr.
william
w.
karatz
many
of
them
sir
are
done
just
by
telephone.
many
are
done
on
the
faith
and
good
word
of
people
in
the
financial
community.
if
you
cannot
rely
on
that
on
wall
street,
then
you
would
have
to
close
up
a
good
many
of
the
financial
institutions
that
you
have
today.
let
me
say
sir
that
the
first
entry
in
the
manhattan
account
was
the
crediting
of
the
$150,000.00
check,
which
was
received
late
in
the
afternoon
of
january
24th.
have
i
answered
your
question
sir?
mr.
william
w.
karatz
as
i
have
stated
previously,
your
honors,
the
unique
fact
in
this
case
may
indeed
form
the
basis
for
a
state
action,
based
on
such
theories
as
embezzlement,
fraudulent
conveyance,
conversion,
corporate
waste
or
violation
of
the
new
york
state
insurance
law.
however,
these
unique
facts
do
not,
and
i
emphasize
it,
your
honors,
do
not
involve
any
wrongdoing
prohibited
by
federal
securities
law.
the
congressional
purpose,
underlying
the
enactment
of
the
securities
acts
was
to
promote
free
and
open
public
securities
markets
and
to
protect
the
investing
public
from
suffering
inequities
in
trading.
these
acts
were
not
intended
to
constitute
a
general,
federal
corporation
law.
in
fact,
congress
has
often
rejected
the
idea
of
a
general
federal
corporate
code.
more
specifically—
mr.
william
w.
karatz
may
i
be
very
frank
with
your
honor?
mr.
william
w.
karatz
here
once
again
sir,
i
was
going
to
our
strategy,
which
possibly
is
something
i
should
not
do.
quite
frankly,
i
do
not
believe
that
my
opponent
is
happy
in
the
new
york
state
courts.
he
has
much
more
experience
in
the
federal
courts.
he
is
more
familiar
with
finding
his
way
around
the
federal
courts.
rightly
or
wrongly,
that
is
the
conclusion
we
have
reached,
that
he
would
be
unhappier
in
the
state
courts.
it
is
not
a
question
of
where
we
would
be
happy.
to
return
to
the
question
of
the
congressional
intent,
congress
did
not
intend,
by
the
enactment
of
the
securities
laws
to
create
federal
law
which
would
govern
every
corporate
management
transaction.
absent
the
compelling
reasons,
it
would
seem
inappropriate
to
inject
the
anti-fraud
doctrine
of
rule
10
(b)
(5)
into
a
case
where
the
unique
question
is
the
fiduciary
duty
owed
by
a
sole
shareholder
to
his
corporation
and
its
creditors.
once
again,
i
emphasize,
your
honors
that
state
common
and
statutory
law
have
long
provided
adequate
remedies
for
whatever
creditors
there
may
be
in
this
picture.
and
with
regard
to
the
creditors,
your
honor,
let
me
say
this.
at
the
time
of
the
liquidation,
all
of
the
policy
holders
of
manhattan
were
re-insured,
so
those
policy
holders
are
no
longer
in
the
picture.
insofar
as
any
other
creditors
are
concerned,
we
have
strained
through
years
of
pre-trail
discovery,
to
find
out
if
in
fact
any
creditor
exists.
we
have
yet
to
be
given
any
concrete
information
as
to
whether
there
is
in
fact
any
creditor.
now,
once
again
i
emphasize
to
your
honors
that
even
if
there
are
creditors,
the
creditors
are
perfectly
capable
of
having
their
remedy
by
way
of
the
long
established
state
remedies.
mr.
bowman
is
bringing
an
action
in
the
state
court.
there
is
the
place,
under
the
state
law
to
look
into
the
situation
to
see
whether
there
are
creditors
and
if
there
are
creditors,
to
provide
the
proper
remedy.
there
is
no
reason
why
the
federal
courts,
by
way
of
an
implied
cause
of
action
under
section
10
(b),
should
preempt
this
entire
well
developed
area
of
state
law
of
creditor's
rights,
when
it
is
clear
from
the
realm
of
the
securities
acts
as
a
whole
that
congress
did
not
so
intent.
it
should
be
left
to
congress
to
decide
whether
the
enforcement
of
a
substantial
part
of
what
is
now
a
corporate
law
should
be
assumed
by
the
federal
courts,
and
i
might
say
in
this
respect,
your
honors
that
congress
has
not
been
delinquent.
congress
is
constantly
analyzing
the
securities
acts
to
decide
whether
there
should
be
amendments
there
too.
there
are
hearings
going
on
across
the
street
at
the
present
time
with
regard
to
the
possible
amendment
to
the
securities
act.
there
are
also
hearings
going
on
with
regard
to
the
proper
division
of
jurisdiction
between
the
federal
and
the
state
courts.
i
suggest
that
this
is
something
that
should
be
left
to
congress
to
analyze
and
by
way
of
carefully
held
hearings,
determine
to
what
extent
congress
wants
to
take
over
general
corporate
law.
the
petitioner
and
the
commission,
in
urging
this
court
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
courts
below
are
in
effect
asking
if
an
extension
of
rule
10
(b)
(5)
far
beyond
any
other
case.
they
are
in
effect,
asking
this
court
to
hope
that
an
alleged
act
of
corporate
mismanagement
which
does
not
involve
a
manipulation
or
deception
intrinsic
to
the
security
transaction,
to
be
a
federal
wrong.
such
an
extension
of
the
coverage
of
the
securities
act
is
not
necessary
in
order
to
carry
out
with
congressional
intent.
i
know
that
your
honors
have
held,
in
prior
cases,
that
the
securities
acts
should
be
broadly
construed
so
as
to
carry
out
the
congressional
intent.
i
happen
to
whole
heartedly
agree
with
that.
i
also
whole
heartedly
agree
that
there
should
be
a
private
course
of
action
under
section
10
(b),
but
i
do
not
believe
that
section
10
(b)
should
be
construed
in
such
a
way
as
to
bring
within
the
scope
a
federal
jurisdiction,
matters
which
congress
never
intended,
the
federal
courts
to
exercise
jurisdiction
over.
judge
herlings,
in
dismissing
the
complaint
herein,
not
only
examined
the
complaint,
but
he
examined
the
entire
pre-trial
record
which
was
years
in
the
making.
after
taking
the
motion
to
dismiss
under
advisement
for
over
nine
months,
he
came
up
with
his,
what
i
believe
to
be,
well
considered
opinion
and
his
well
reasoned
opinion,
in
which
he
concluded
that
under
the
unique
facts
in
this
action,
you
did
not
have
a
federal
claim.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
affirmed
judge
herlings
and
i
might
say
also
that
possibly
because
judge
herlings
came
through
with
a
lengthy
opinion,
we
forget
judge
ryan.
not
only
was
a
motion
to
dismiss
made
before
judge
herlings,
but
a
similar
motion
was
made
before
judge
ryan,
who
also
considered
the
matter
in
excess
of
nine
months
and
then
came
out
with
an
opinion,
agreeing
with
judge
herlings.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
opinions
of
both
judge
herlings
and
judge
ryan
and
i
think
it's
a
matter
of
general
knowledge,
that
it
is
the
second
circuit,
which
after
all
has
had
to
give
the
consideration
to
most
of
the
securities
acts
cases
and
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
second
circuit
has
uniformly,
broadly
interpreted
the
securities
act
cases
before
so
as
to
provide
a
remedy
when
one
is
necessary
to
carry
out
the
congressional
intent.
as
judge
herling
stated
below,
this
is
another
of
many
of
the
recurring
cases
in
which
the
question
basically
is,
does
the
plaintiff
belong
in
the
state
courts
or
has
he
spelled
out
a
federal
claim.
this
case,
once
again,
i
emphasize,
involves
a
misappropriation
of
corporate
assets
by
a
sole
shareholder
or
the
corporation,
involves
no
injury
to
any
public
investor,
involves
no
purchase
of
sale
of
any
security
for
less
than
its
spare
value
and
it
had
no
effect
whatsoever
on
any
securities
market.
on
these
unique
facts,
i
suggest,
your
honors,
that
plaintiff
has
stated
no
federal
claim
and
that
he
should
pursue
his
remedy
in
the
state
court
action
which
was
brought
against
the
same
plaintiffs,
based
on
the
same
facts
and
in
which
he
asked
for
the
same
damages.
if
i
may
your
honors,
with
just
a
few
questions
posed
this
morning
for
mr.
bowman,
which
i
might
respond
to,
i
believe
mr.
justice
white
asked
how
the
bonds
were
sold.
i
believe
i
have
responded
to
that
that
it
was
a
private
sale,
transaction
between
manhattan
and
second
district
security.
once
again,
there
are
no
security
market
was
involved,
no
public
exchange
was
involved.
if
i
may
go
to
this
question
of
creditor
standing,
under
the
securities
laws,
it
is
my
position
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
provide
any
rights
under
the
security
laws
to
creditors
as
a
class.
the
securities
laws,
if
you
read
them
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
were
composed
to
provide
remedies
to
security
holders,
to
purchasers
and
sellers
of
securities.
once
again,
i
suggest
there
was
no
need
to
provide
a
remedy
to
creditors
because
creditors
already
had
adequate
remedy
in
the
state
courts.
i
would
suggest
that
if
you
look
at
the
field
versus
lue
case,
you
will
see,
and
which
was
referred
to
by
mr.
bowman
and
which
is
cited
at
length
in
my
brief,
you
will
see
that
it
is
very
relevant
to
the
issue
before,
your
honors.
what
field
versus
lue
does
is
to
analyze
what
a
corporation
is
and
in
that
case,
it
was
concluded
by
the
district
court
that
when
the
sole
stockholder
of
a
corporation
ratifies
and
participates
in
a
corporate
transaction,
it
is
corporate
action.
the
corporation
they
are
asked
--
thereafter
has
no
remedy
against
the
sole
stockholder.
the
remedy
of
any
creditor
who
is
damaged
is
by
way
of
an
action
for
fraudulent
conveyance
or
some
similar
type
of
action.
now,
if
the
situation
has
resulted
in
a
trustee
and
bankruptcy
being
appointed
under
the
bankruptcy
law,
then
i
think
the
field
case
clearly
demonstrates
the
division
of
responsibility
that
a
trustee
and
bankruptcy
has.
a
trustee
and
bankruptcy
can
sue
on
behalf
of
the
corporation
and
it
can
sue
on
behalf
of
the
creditor,
but
i
suggest
that
what
was
happening
in
field
was
that
the
trustee
and
bankruptcy,
the
plaintiff
there
was
being
told
that
because
of
the
ratification
of
the
actions
by
the
sole
stockholder,
he
had
no
cause
of
action
on
behalf
of
the
corporation,
that
does
not
mean
he
does
not
have
a
cause
of
action
on
behalf
of
the
creditors
but
to
carry
that
analysis
into
this
case,
if
in
fact
what
mr.
bowman
is
doing,
he
is
suing
on
behalf
of
creditors,
then
i
suggest
that
under
the
birnbaum
doctrine,
he
has
no
standing
to
sue
because
the
creditors
are
not
purchasers
or
sellers
of
a
security
and
i
suggest,
your
honors
that
birnbaum,
not
only
is
law
in
the
second
circuit,
it
is
law
in
all
of
the
circuits
which
have
carefully
considered
the
question
and
i
think
rightfully
should
remain
the
law.
mr.
william
w.
karatz
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
plaintiff's
basic
contention
here
is
that
a
claim
under
the
federal
securities
laws
is
stated
because
manhattan's
sole
shareholder
misappropriated
manhattan's
funds
insofar
as
the
proceeds
from
the
sale
of
manhattan's
bonds
were
concerned.
there
are
at
least
two
reasons
why
plaintiff
is
wrong
in
asserting
that
manhattan
has
any
claim
under
federal
law
in
connection
with
this
transaction.
first,
there
was
no
deception
of
or
damage
to
manhattan
because
manhattan's
sole
shareholder
knew
of,
participated
in,
benefited
from
and
fully
ratified
the
allegedly
fraudulent
transaction.
since
manhattan,
by
way
of
its
sole
shareholder
could
not
have
been
deceived,
suffered
no
damage,
there
was
no
federal
fraud
in
connection
with
the
sale
of
any
security,
either
the
manhattan
bonds
or
anything
else.
now,
mr.
bowman
and
mr.
north
have
suggested
that
there
is
something
to
a
corporation
other
than
its
shareholders.
i
would
suggest
that
it
is
standard
corporate
law
that
when
shareholders
fully
ratify
the
action
taken
by
a
corporation,
that
becomes
corporate
action.
now,
it
may
be
that
such
action
would
constitute
a
fraud
on
creditors,
as
long
established
common
law
in
this
area.
if
corporate
insiders
by
their
actions
with
regard
to
the
corporation
in
someway
damage
creditors,
creditors
have
remedies
at
common
law
and
by
statute
in
all
of
the
states.
they
have
remedies
by
way
of
an
action
for
fraudulent
conveyance.
they
have
actions
by
way
of,
an
action
for
illegal
dividend.
there
was
no
need
for
congress
to
provide
creditor
remedies.
those
remedies
already
were
available
to
creditors
and
i
suggest
that
if
you
have
sole
stockholder
approval
of
an
action,
certainly
under
federal
law
and
in
federal
securities
law,
there
can
be
no
fraud
on
the
corporation.
mr.
william
w.
karatz
your
honor,
if
i
may
be
very
frank
about
the
reason
why
we
are
here
today,
and
quite
frankly
i
am
glad
i
am
here
today
because
i
think
this
is
an
important
issue
of
law
because
chief
judge
ryan
invited
the
defendants
to
make
a
motion
to
dismiss.
if
i
may
tell
you
quite
frankly
what
tactics
of
defense
counsel
was
on
this
case,
we
were
going
to
take
it
through
the
trial
in
the
federal
courts
and
then
get
the
case
dismissed,
because
we
did
not
think
that
there
was
a
federal
claim
here.
we
went
all
the
way
through
years
of
pre-trial
discovery,
thousands
of
pages
of
testimonies,
hundreds
of
documents.
chief
judge
ryan,
when
mr.
parker
made
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
refused
to
decide
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
on
its
merits,
stating
that
in
his
view,
the
complaint
did
not
spell
out
a
claim
and
suggested
to
counsel
that
a
motion
to
dismiss
be
made,
because
he
felt
that
this
was
not
a
federal
action
and
that
the
federal
courts
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
should
not
have
to
go
through
a
trial
that
will
take
weeks,
if
not
months.
we
made
that
motion
to
dismiss,
pursuant
to
the
suggestion
of
judge
ryan
and
we
were
sustained
in
our
relief
all
the
way
up
to
this
court
that
there
is
no
federal
claim
here.
now,
in
response
to
judge
blackmun's
question
as
to
why
we
prefer
to
be
in
the
state
courts,
we
do
not
necessarily
prefer
to
be
in
the
state
courts,
your
honor.
we
just
feel
that
that
is
the
place
where
we
should
be
because
of
the
state
of
the
law
and
i
might
say
that
as
a
member
of
the
bar
of
new
york,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
calendar
of
the
southern
district
should
be
clogged
with
10
(b)
(5)
cases
as
it
is
today
which
do
not
rightfully
belong
there.
the
second
reason
why
plaintiff
is
wrong
in
asserting
that
there
has
been
an
injury
to
manhattan
in
connection
with
the
purchases
or
sale
of
the
security
is
that
this
case
does
not
involve
any
impurity
in
any
security
transaction.
as
the
courts
below
concluded,
there
can
be
no
fraud
in
connection
with
a
security
transaction
when
none
of
the
following
three
facts
are
involved.
first,
this
case
does
not
involve
the
purchase
or
sale
of
any
security
for
more
or
less
than
its
fair
market
value.
second,
this
case
does
not
involve
any
actual
or
potential
manipulation
or
abuse
of
the
trading
process.
third,
this
case
does
not
involve
any
injury
to
any
manhattan
shareholder
or
to
any
other
member
of
the
investing
public.
what
this
case
does
involve,
your
honors,
is
a
claim
that
defendant
begole,
the
sole
shareholder
of
manhattan,
misappropriated
manhattan
funds
for
his
own
benefits
and
that
this
misappropriation
was
not
reported
to
the
superintendent
of
insurance
of
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
william
w.
karatz
yes
sir.
mr.
william
w.
karatz
now,
quite
frankly,
your
honor,
irving
received
no
fee
for
the
five
--
let
me
break
up
the
checks.
the
first
five
million
dollar
check,
the
one
payable
to
bankers
life
and
casualty
company
which
constituted
the
payment
by
mr.
begole
for
a
stock,
was
delivered
by
the
irving
officer
to
the
bankers
life
representative
at
the
closing
as
a
convenience
to
mr.
garvin
who
was
one
of
the
leading
members
of
the
new
york
brokerage
community.
mr.
garvin’s
house
was
well
recognized
as
a
leader
in
the
area
of
government
bonds,
securities
and
certificates
of
deposit.
i
might
say
that
the
way
business
is
done
on
wall
street
is
by
requests
being
made
by
people
who
are
respected
and
those
requests
being
honored.
millions
of
dollars
of
businesses
done
everyday
by
all
of
the
leading
banks
in
new
york
city
on
word
of
mouth,
without
any
paper
being
transferred.
mr.
garvin
came
to
mr.
gunter,
who
is
an
assistant
secretary
of
irving
trust
company,
who
had
known
mr.
garvin
for
years,
who
had
known
his
brokerage
house
for
years
and
requested
that
five
million
dollars
be
given
in
return
for
funds
which
would
be
returned
to
irving
the
same
day.
it
was
convenience
to
mr.
garvin.
it
was
something
which
is
not
unusual
in
the
wall
street
community.
mr.
william
w.
karatz
the
second
check,
your
honor,
let
me
say
how
that
came
about.
after
the
first
transaction,
namely
the
closing
at
manhattan
had
taken
place,
mr.
gunter
got
back
to
the
bank.
he
received
a
telephone
call
from
mr.
garvin
and
he
said
that
there
was
a
second
half
to
the
transaction.
mr.
gunter
replied
to
mr.
garvin
and
this
is
all
in
testimony
in
pretrial
discovery,
i
was
not
aware
of
any
second
half
of
the
transaction
and
mr.
garvin
just
said,
well,
this
is
just
a
simple
check
swap
which
is
going
to
take
place
at
belgian-american
bank,
there
you
will
give
five
million
dollars
and
you
will
get
back
five
million
dollars.
mr.
gunter,
under
those
circumstances
did
not
feel
that
there
was
any
reason
why
he
should
not
go
along
with
the
request
to
this
respected
member
of
the
broker’s
community
and
did
so.
mr.
william
w.
karatz
no
sir.
there
was
an
attempt
to
indicate
to
the
court
that
there
was
a
nice,
clean
cut
arrangement
whereby
you
had
a
morning
transaction
and
an
afternoon
transaction.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
not
that
simple
and
i
would
refer
your
honors
for
a
detail
in
statement
of
them
to
the
appendix
in
my
brief
where
we
do
try
to
take
you
step
by
step
through
these
complex
transactions.
in
response
to
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice
brennan,
when
mr.
gunter
went
to
belgian-american
in
the
afternoon,
the
government
bonds
of
manhattan
had
not
yet
been
sold.
certainly,
the
amount
for
which
they
were
sold
had
not
yet
been
indicated.
the
way
that
this
operated
was
that
the
government
bond
transaction,
the
sale
of
government
bonds
was
a
private
transaction
between
manhattan
casualty
and
second
district
securities,
a
large
bond
house
in
new
york.
the
bonds
were
gradually
delivered
to
second
district
and
notices
came
for
second
district,
during
the
course
of
the
day
and
on
into
the
evening
as
to
the
amount
which
was
being
paid
for
the
bonds,
that
the
amount
being
paid
for
the
bonds
depended
on
the
going
rate
for
those
bonds
at
that
particular
time
of
delivery.
so,
during
the
entire
course
of
the
day,
afternoon
and
into
the
evening,
and
i
might
say
that
mr.
gunter’s
responsibilities
was
in
the
security
clearance
division
on
the
bank,
the
securities
clearance
division
has
to
do
with
receipt
of
securities
and
payment
for
securities
and
literally,
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
of
transactions
are
dealt
with
everyday
by
irving
trust
company
alone
in
this
particular
division
of
the
bank.
so
when
mr.
gunter
went
home
that
evening,
which
was,
as
i
recall
the
testimony
in
the
pretrial,
eight
or
nine
o’clock,
he
still
was
not
sure
exactly
how
much
had
been
received
for
the
securities
during
the
course
of
the
day.
i
might
also
say
that
and
as
i
have
been
pointed
out
to
your
honors,
the
bonds
ultimately
produced
only
$4,800,000
odd
dollars.
a
$150,000.00
check
of
manhattan
drawn
on
another
bank
was
delivered
to
irving
sometime
during
the
late
afternoon
of
january
24.
that
check
was
payable
to
the
order
of
manhattan
casualty
company
and
that
check
constituted
a
credit
to
manhattan's
account
at
irving
and
in
fact
that
is
exactly
what
form
it
took,
the
manhattan
check,
drawn
in
another
bank,
payable
to
itself
for
$150,000.00,
was
credited
to
manhattan's
account
at
irving.
mr.
william
w.
karatz
i
deny
that
sir,
they
were
not
false
entries.
the
entries
which
remained
at
irving
were
corrected
when
mr.
gunter
came
to
understand
what
he
thought
the
true
situation
was,
if
i
may
sir,
go
into
mr.
gunter's
examination
before
trial.
mr.
gunter
originally
was
led
to
believe
by
mr.
garvin
that
the
morning
check
for
five
million
dollars
would
be
covered
by
a
receipt
by
irving
trust
later
on
in
the
day
of
securities
which
would
be
sold
and
the
proceeds
applied
to
cover
the
five
million
dollar
check.
mr.
william
w.
karatz
no,
sold
by
manhattan,
to
second
district.
they
would
just
be
delivered
to
irving
for
purposes
of
redelivery
to
the
purchase
of
the
bonds.
mr.
gunter
was
also
informed,
as
i
mentioned
in
reply
to
an
earlier
question
that
the
second
transaction,
the
second
five
million
dollar
transaction
was
just
a
check
swap.
now
it
turned
out,
however,
that
when
the
documentation
of
what
had
gone
on
during
the
course
of
the
day
started
to
come
into
the
bank
and
it
started
to
come
in
on
january
24,
mr.
gunter
gathered
that
he
had
misunderstood
what
the
true
situation
was
and
made
the
entries
which
complied
with
the
written
instructions
which
he
was
receiving
from
various
people.
now,
what
were
the
written
instructions?
mr.
gunter
received
sometime
during
the
course
of
the
day
on
january
24,
a
letter
from
manhattan
casualty
company
signed
by
mr.
sweeny
as
president
of
manhattan,
instructing
irving
to
transfer
five
million
dollars
from
manhattan's
account
at
irving
to
belgian-american.
now,
this
was
duly
signed
by
a
representative
of
manhattan
casualty
whose
name
appeared
on
irving's
books
as
an
authorized
signatory
for
the
manhattan
account
which
was
also
opened
on
that
january
24.
mr.
william
w.
karatz
no,
manhattan
opened
an
account
on
the
very
day.
mr.
william
w.
karatz
that
is
certainly
was
one
of
the
first
items
in
it
sir.
mr.
william
w.
karatz
well
let
me
say
this
mr.
justice
brennan,
oh
i
am
sorry,
blackmun,
it
is
a
new
account
as
of
january
24,
but
manhattan
casualty
had
been
a
customer
of
irving
in
years
past.
they
were
not
a
customer
as
of
january
24,
but
it
was
not
really
a
new
customer,
it
was
just
a
renewal
of
an
old
relationship.
to
go
back
to
justice
douglas’
question,
when
mr.
gunter,
at
the
end
of
the
business
day
or
early
the
next
day,
because
as
i
say
he
did
not
leave
the
bank
because
of
the
rush
of
business
until
late
in
the
evening,
saw
this
letter
from
mr.
sweeny.
he
recognized
the
afternoon
transaction
as
having
been
a
transfer
of
manhattan
funds
to
belgian-american,
a
transfer
which
should
be
debited
to
the
manhattan
account
at
irving
and
that
is
exactly
what
he
did.
so
--
mr.
william
w.
karatz
as
of
that
time,
your
honor,
well
i
am
sorry
mr.
justice
marshall,
as
of
which
time?
mr.
william
w.
karatz
well,
when
all
--
let
me
say
at
the
time
that
he
credited
the
--
well
i
am
sorry,
when
he
debited
or
credited,
sir?
i
mean
which
item
are
we
talking
about?
mr.
william
w.
karatz
well,
okay.
let
me
tell
you
the
history
of
the
situation
as
so
far
as
irving
is
concerned.
mr.
william
w.
karatz
when
irving
issued
the
five
million
dollar
afternoon
check,
mr.
gunther
of
course
did
not
know
that
he
was
supposed
to
be
doing
this,
pursuing
to
the
instructions
of
manhattan.
at
that
time,
he
was
acting
pursuant
to
these
oral
instructions
of
mr.
garvin
saying
that
this
was
the
second
half
of
the
transaction.
by
the
time
he
saw
the
letter
from
mr.
sweeny,
instructing
the
five
million
dollar
transaction
to
take
place
in
the
afternoon
of
january
24,
manhattan
had
credited
to
its
account
the
$4,800,000
proceeds
from
the
sale
of
the
securities
plus
the
$150,000.00
check.
mr.
william
w.
karatz
no
but
the
bookkeeping
entries
were
actually
made
on
january
25th
as
of
january
24th
by
the
time
they
caught
up
with
the
–
mr.
william
w.
karatz
well
no
sir,
actually,
at
the
time
the
bookkeeping
entries
were
made,
the
money
in
fact
was
there.
when--(voice
overlap).
mr.
william
w.
karatz
no,
i
am
talking
about
the
entries,
sir
to
the
manhattan
account.
mr.
william
w.
karatz
no,
the
entries
to
the
manhattan
account
were
made
on
january
25
as
of
january
24,
at
which
time
they
were
able
to
catch
up
with
all
of
the
business
which
had
accumulated
during
the
day
and
your
honor,
once
again,
i
have
to
emphasize
that
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
department
of
a
bank
which
has
literally
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
of
transactions
everyday,
this
is
not
an
isolated
situation.
mr.
william
w.
karatz
pardon?
mr.
william
w.
karatz
many
of
them
sir
are
done
just
by
telephone.
many
are
done
on
the
faith
and
good
word
of
people
in
the
financial
community.
if
you
cannot
rely
on
that
on
wall
street,
then
you
would
have
to
close
up
a
good
many
of
the
financial
institutions
that
you
have
today.
let
me
say
sir
that
the
first
entry
in
the
manhattan
account
was
the
crediting
of
the
$150,000.00
check,
which
was
received
late
in
the
afternoon
of
january
24th.
have
i
answered
your
question
sir?
mr.
william
w.
karatz
as
i
have
stated
previously,
your
honors,
the
unique
fact
in
this
case
may
indeed
form
the
basis
for
a
state
action,
based
on
such
theories
as
embezzlement,
fraudulent
conveyance,
conversion,
corporate
waste
or
violation
of
the
new
york
state
insurance
law.
however,
these
unique
facts
do
not,
and
i
emphasize
it,
your
honors,
do
not
involve
any
wrongdoing
prohibited
by
federal
securities
law.
the
congressional
purpose,
underlying
the
enactment
of
the
securities
acts
was
to
promote
free
and
open
public
securities
markets
and
to
protect
the
investing
public
from
suffering
inequities
in
trading.
these
acts
were
not
intended
to
constitute
a
general,
federal
corporation
law.
in
fact,
congress
has
often
rejected
the
idea
of
a
general
federal
corporate
code.
more
specifically—
mr.
william
w.
karatz
may
i
be
very
frank
with
your
honor?
mr.
william
w.
karatz
here
once
again
sir,
i
was
going
to
our
strategy,
which
possibly
is
something
i
should
not
do.
quite
frankly,
i
do
not
believe
that
my
opponent
is
happy
in
the
new
york
state
courts.
he
has
much
more
experience
in
the
federal
courts.
he
is
more
familiar
with
finding
his
way
around
the
federal
courts.
rightly
or
wrongly,
that
is
the
conclusion
we
have
reached,
that
he
would
be
unhappier
in
the
state
courts.
it
is
not
a
question
of
where
we
would
be
happy.
to
return
to
the
question
of
the
congressional
intent,
congress
did
not
intend,
by
the
enactment
of
the
securities
laws
to
create
federal
law
which
would
govern
every
corporate
management
transaction.
absent
the
compelling
reasons,
it
would
seem
inappropriate
to
inject
the
anti-fraud
doctrine
of
rule
10
(b)
(5)
into
a
case
where
the
unique
question
is
the
fiduciary
duty
owed
by
a
sole
shareholder
to
his
corporation
and
its
creditors.
once
again,
i
emphasize,
your
honors
that
state
common
and
statutory
law
have
long
provided
adequate
remedies
for
whatever
creditors
there
may
be
in
this
picture.
and
with
regard
to
the
creditors,
your
honor,
let
me
say
this.
at
the
time
of
the
liquidation,
all
of
the
policy
holders
of
manhattan
were
re-insured,
so
those
policy
holders
are
no
longer
in
the
picture.
insofar
as
any
other
creditors
are
concerned,
we
have
strained
through
years
of
pre-trail
discovery,
to
find
out
if
in
fact
any
creditor
exists.
we
have
yet
to
be
given
any
concrete
information
as
to
whether
there
is
in
fact
any
creditor.
now,
once
again
i
emphasize
to
your
honors
that
even
if
there
are
creditors,
the
creditors
are
perfectly
capable
of
having
their
remedy
by
way
of
the
long
established
state
remedies.
mr.
bowman
is
bringing
an
action
in
the
state
court.
there
is
the
place,
under
the
state
law
to
look
into
the
situation
to
see
whether
there
are
creditors
and
if
there
are
creditors,
to
provide
the
proper
remedy.
there
is
no
reason
why
the
federal
courts,
by
way
of
an
implied
cause
of
action
under
section
10
(b),
should
preempt
this
entire
well
developed
area
of
state
law
of
creditor's
rights,
when
it
is
clear
from
the
realm
of
the
securities
acts
as
a
whole
that
congress
did
not
so
intent.
it
should
be
left
to
congress
to
decide
whether
the
enforcement
of
a
substantial
part
of
what
is
now
a
corporate
law
should
be
assumed
by
the
federal
courts,
and
i
might
say
in
this
respect,
your
honors
that
congress
has
not
been
delinquent.
congress
is
constantly
analyzing
the
securities
acts
to
decide
whether
there
should
be
amendments
there
too.
there
are
hearings
going
on
across
the
street
at
the
present
time
with
regard
to
the
possible
amendment
to
the
securities
act.
there
are
also
hearings
going
on
with
regard
to
the
proper
division
of
jurisdiction
between
the
federal
and
the
state
courts.
i
suggest
that
this
is
something
that
should
be
left
to
congress
to
analyze
and
by
way
of
carefully
held
hearings,
determine
to
what
extent
congress
wants
to
take
over
general
corporate
law.
the
petitioner
and
the
commission,
in
urging
this
court
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
courts
below
are
in
effect
asking
if
an
extension
of
rule
10
(b)
(5)
far
beyond
any
other
case.
they
are
in
effect,
asking
this
court
to
hope
that
an
alleged
act
of
corporate
mismanagement
which
does
not
involve
a
manipulation
or
deception
intrinsic
to
the
security
transaction,
to
be
a
federal
wrong.
such
an
extension
of
the
coverage
of
the
securities
act
is
not
necessary
in
order
to
carry
out
with
congressional
intent.
i
know
that
your
honors
have
held,
in
prior
cases,
that
the
securities
acts
should
be
broadly
construed
so
as
to
carry
out
the
congressional
intent.
i
happen
to
whole
heartedly
agree
with
that.
i
also
whole
heartedly
agree
that
there
should
be
a
private
course
of
action
under
section
10
(b),
but
i
do
not
believe
that
section
10
(b)
should
be
construed
in
such
a
way
as
to
bring
within
the
scope
a
federal
jurisdiction,
matters
which
congress
never
intended,
the
federal
courts
to
exercise
jurisdiction
over.
judge
herlings,
in
dismissing
the
complaint
herein,
not
only
examined
the
complaint,
but
he
examined
the
entire
pre-trial
record
which
was
years
in
the
making.
after
taking
the
motion
to
dismiss
under
advisement
for
over
nine
months,
he
came
up
with
his,
what
i
believe
to
be,
well
considered
opinion
and
his
well
reasoned
opinion,
in
which
he
concluded
that
under
the
unique
facts
in
this
action,
you
did
not
have
a
federal
claim.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
affirmed
judge
herlings
and
i
might
say
also
that
possibly
because
judge
herlings
came
through
with
a
lengthy
opinion,
we
forget
judge
ryan.
not
only
was
a
motion
to
dismiss
made
before
judge
herlings,
but
a
similar
motion
was
made
before
judge
ryan,
who
also
considered
the
matter
in
excess
of
nine
months
and
then
came
out
with
an
opinion,
agreeing
with
judge
herlings.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
opinions
of
both
judge
herlings
and
judge
ryan
and
i
think
it's
a
matter
of
general
knowledge,
that
it
is
the
second
circuit,
which
after
all
has
had
to
give
the
consideration
to
most
of
the
securities
acts
cases
and
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
second
circuit
has
uniformly,
broadly
interpreted
the
securities
act
cases
before
so
as
to
provide
a
remedy
when
one
is
necessary
to
carry
out
the
congressional
intent.
as
judge
herling
stated
below,
this
is
another
of
many
of
the
recurring
cases
in
which
the
question
basically
is,
does
the
plaintiff
belong
in
the
state
courts
or
has
he
spelled
out
a
federal
claim.
this
case,
once
again,
i
emphasize,
involves
a
misappropriation
of
corporate
assets
by
a
sole
shareholder
or
the
corporation,
involves
no
injury
to
any
public
investor,
involves
no
purchase
of
sale
of
any
security
for
less
than
its
spare
value
and
it
had
no
effect
whatsoever
on
any
securities
market.
on
these
unique
facts,
i
suggest,
your
honors,
that
plaintiff
has
stated
no
federal
claim
and
that
he
should
pursue
his
remedy
in
the
state
court
action
which
was
brought
against
the
same
plaintiffs,
based
on
the
same
facts
and
in
which
he
asked
for
the
same
damages.
if
i
may
your
honors,
with
just
a
few
questions
posed
this
morning
for
mr.
bowman,
which
i
might
respond
to,
i
believe
mr.
justice
white
asked
how
the
bonds
were
sold.
i
believe
i
have
responded
to
that
that
it
was
a
private
sale,
transaction
between
manhattan
and
second
district
security.
once
again,
there
are
no
security
market
was
involved,
no
public
exchange
was
involved.
if
i
may
go
to
this
question
of
creditor
standing,
under
the
securities
laws,
it
is
my
position
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
provide
any
rights
under
the
security
laws
to
creditors
as
a
class.
the
securities
laws,
if
you
read
them
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
were
composed
to
provide
remedies
to
security
holders,
to
purchasers
and
sellers
of
securities.
once
again,
i
suggest
there
was
no
need
to
provide
a
remedy
to
creditors
because
creditors
already
had
adequate
remedy
in
the
state
courts.
i
would
suggest
that
if
you
look
at
the
field
versus
lue
case,
you
will
see,
and
which
was
referred
to
by
mr.
bowman
and
which
is
cited
at
length
in
my
brief,
you
will
see
that
it
is
very
relevant
to
the
issue
before,
your
honors.
what
field
versus
lue
does
is
to
analyze
what
a
corporation
is
and
in
that
case,
it
was
concluded
by
the
district
court
that
when
the
sole
stockholder
of
a
corporation
ratifies
and
participates
in
a
corporate
transaction,
it
is
corporate
action.
the
corporation
they
are
asked
--
thereafter
has
no
remedy
against
the
sole
stockholder.
the
remedy
of
any
creditor
who
is
damaged
is
by
way
of
an
action
for
fraudulent
conveyance
or
some
similar
type
of
action.
now,
if
the
situation
has
resulted
in
a
trustee
and
bankruptcy
being
appointed
under
the
bankruptcy
law,
then
i
think
the
field
case
clearly
demonstrates
the
division
of
responsibility
that
a
trustee
and
bankruptcy
has.
a
trustee
and
bankruptcy
can
sue
on
behalf
of
the
corporation
and
it
can
sue
on
behalf
of
the
creditor,
but
i
suggest
that
what
was
happening
in
field
was
that
the
trustee
and
bankruptcy,
the
plaintiff
there
was
being
told
that
because
of
the
ratification
of
the
actions
by
the
sole
stockholder,
he
had
no
cause
of
action
on
behalf
of
the
corporation,
that
does
not
mean
he
does
not
have
a
cause
of
action
on
behalf
of
the
creditors
but
to
carry
that
analysis
into
this
case,
if
in
fact
what
mr.
bowman
is
doing,
he
is
suing
on
behalf
of
creditors,
then
i
suggest
that
under
the
birnbaum
doctrine,
he
has
no
standing
to
sue
because
the
creditors
are
not
purchasers
or
sellers
of
a
security
and
i
suggest,
your
honors
that
birnbaum,
not
only
is
law
in
the
second
circuit,
it
is
law
in
all
of
the
circuits
which
have
carefully
considered
the
question
and
i
think
rightfully
should
remain
the
law.
