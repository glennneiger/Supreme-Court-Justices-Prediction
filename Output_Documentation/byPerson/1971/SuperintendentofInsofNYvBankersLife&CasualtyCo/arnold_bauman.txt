mr.
arnold
bauman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
appears
in
this
court
as
a
result
of
a
grant
of
certiorari
to
review
the
affirmance
of
judgments
by
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
affirmed
a
motion
of
the
district
court,
dismissing
the
complaint
in
this
case,
on
the
basis
that
the
complaint
did
not
present
an
instance
of
federal
jurisdiction
under
rule
17
of
the
security
act
of
1933
or
rule
10
and,
i
beg
your
pardon,
section
10
and
rule
10
(b)
5
of
the
security
act
of
1934.
as
i
am
certain,
the
court
is
aware,
i
shall
say,
merely
very
briefly
that
section
17
(a)
of
the
1933
act
deals
with
the
usage
of
interstate
facilities
of
interstate
commerce
in
connection
with
the
stock
frauds
involved
in
the
purchase
of
securities.
section
10
(b)
which
is
reproduced
at
page
3
of
our
brief
as
well
as
rule
10
(b)
(5)
was
later
passed,
a
year
later,
and
i
respectfully
urge
upon
the
court
that
it
was
passed
to
cover
the
loopholes,
to
make
up
for
the
loopholes
which
congress
left
when
it
passed
section
17
(a)
of
the
1933
act.
now,
i
should
like
merely
to
refer
to
one
part
of
section
10
(b)
because
it
is
at
the
crux
and
at
the
center
of
the
argument
that
i
intend
to
make.
section
10
of
course
states
that
“it
shall
be
unlawful
for
anyone
by
use
of
means
of
interstate
commerce
to
use
or
employ
any
deceptive
device,”
and
of
course
i
am
leaving
up
irrelevant
words,
“in
contravention
of
such
rules
and
regulations
as
the
commission
may
prescribe
as
necessary
or
appropriate
in
the
public
interest
or,”
or
and
i
shall
come
to
the
reason
for
that
emphasis,
“for
the
protection
of
investors.”
i
think
i
can
say
now
before
i
discuss
the
facts
with
the
court
that
the
reason
i
stressed
the
“or”
in
rule
10
(b)
(5)
is
because
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
court
below,
both
courts
below,
judge
herlings
(ph)
in
the
district
court
and
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit,
both
tended
to
read
the
protection,
the
words
“in
the
public
interest”
as
synonymous
with
the
“protection
of
investors.”
and
i
respectfully
submit
to
this
court
that
when
rule
was
promulgated,
the
exchange
had
in
mind,
i
beg
your
pardon,
when
that
section
was
passed,
the
congress
had
in
mind
a
different
test
for
that
which
is
alleged
to
have
been
in
the
public
interest
from
that
which
is
necessary
for
the
protection
of
investors.
mr.
arnold
bauman
yes
sir?
mr.
arnold
bauman
your
honor,
i
was
just
this
moment
coming
to
that.
i
was
about
to
say
that
rule
10
(b)
(5)
presents
or
gives
rise
to
the
second
or
another
one
of
the
issues
in
this
case,
in
that
it
in
effect
paraphrases
section
17
(a),
but
then
adds
as
mr.
justice
brennan
has
called
to
my
attention,
in
his
very
last
words,
that
it
prohibits
unlawful
actions
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
any
security.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
should
like
to
use
part
of
my
time
to
discuss
the
facts
with
the
court
because
i
think
they
are
very
important
in
this
case,
but
in
order
to
put
it
in
focus,
i
would
like
to
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
felt
that
where
a
securities
transaction
is
pure
in
itself,
in
other
words,
securities
worth
x
dollars
are
sold
for
x
dollars,
even
though
that
is
part
of
an
--
and
an
integral
part,
indeed
a
--
an
absolutely
necessary
part
of
an
overall
fraudulent
scheme
to
fact
that
neither
the
securities
transaction
was
impure
nor
were
the
processes
of
a
marketplace,
solely
to
use
the
words
of
the
opinion
below,
that
in
such
a
case
as
long
as
the
--
as
the
securities
transaction
is
pure,
the
court
below
felt
that
it
was
not
“in
connection
with
a
securities
transaction.”
now,
with
the
court's
permission
i
should
like
to
address
myself
to
the
facts
of
this
case
because
as
i
say
in
my
view
they
are
--
they
are
that
important.
i
should
say
at
the
very
first
that
i
appear
as
a
representative
of
the
superintendent
of
insurances
of
the
state
of
new
york
who
as
a
result
of
the
transactions
which
i
am
about
to
relate
was
appointed
liquidator
of
manhattan
casualty
company,
a
new
york
insurance
company
and
of
course
the
liquidator
was
appointed
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
functions
under
an
order
of
such
appointment.
until
january
24,
1962,
bankers
life
was
the
sole
stockholder
of
manhattan
casualty
corporation.
on
that
day
bankers
sold
its
manhattan
stock
to
a
group
consisting
of
a
man
named
bourne
and
another
man
named
begole,
who
had
no
money
at
all
as
will
come
out
in
a
moment,
for
five
million
dollars.
it
had
previously
been
arranged
with
the
irving
trust
company
that
at
the
closing
of
this
manhattan
stock,
irving
would
appear
with
the
check
for
five
million
dollars
and
at
the
closing,
at
the
sale
from
bankers
life
to
bourne
and
begole,
a
representative,
an
officer
of
irving
trust
did
in
fact
appear
with
a
check
made
up
in
the
sum
of
five
million
dollars
payable
to
bankers
life.
this
was
delivered
at
the
--
at
the
closing.
i
should
point
out
that
in
this
point
of
time
and
indeed
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
until
after
the
close
of
business
on
january
24th,
1962,
manhattan
casualty
had
no
account
to
them,
nonetheless,
irving
did
issue
this
check
of
five
million
to
bankers
life
obviously
to
pay
for
the
stock
which
was
being
transferred.
shortly
after
the
closing
of
the
stock,
a
new
board
was
elected
and
the
board
convened.
mr.
arnold
bauman
yes
sir,
and
the
board
convened.
it
was
represented,
and
i
believe
the
record
best
indicates
that
it
was
represented
at
that
meeting
by
the
chairman
of
the
board,
new
board
of
manhattan,
the
man
begole
whom
i
previously
made
reference
as
a
purchaser
that
manhattan's
portfolio
of
government
securities,
us
government
bonds
and
securities
totaling
some
$4,854,000.00
was
an
undesirable
investment
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
corporation
and
recommended
to
the
board
of
directors
that
in
order
to
bet
at
the
corporate
position,
these
bonds
should
be
sold
and
the
money
invested
in
a
certificate
of
deposit.
the
board
of
directors,
believing
that
the
sale
of
its
portfolio
of
government
securities
totaling
almost
some
five
million
dollars
was
so
going
to
be
altered,
voted
a
resolution
relying
on
the
misrepresentations
of
the
chairman,
authorizing
the
sale
of
the
portfolio
of
manhattan's
government
funds.
they
were
rapidly
sold.
mr.
arnold
bauman
i
am
not
--
they
were
sold
to
the
second
district
securities
and
i
am
not
certain
whether
or
not
in
that
sale
an
instrumentality
of
the
stock
exchange
was
used,
i
do
not
believe
so
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
arnold
bauman
no
sir,
it
does
not.
under
section
10
in
rule
10
(b)
(5)
it
is
not
required
that
security
sold
be
either
listed
or
unlisted
or
--
mr.
arnold
bauman
i
think
the
reason
we
are
here
has
not
to
do
along
with
the
--
with
the
sale
of
those
securities,
but
the
fact
that
payment,
a
check
in
the
sum
of
five
million
dollars,
the
payment
to
bankers
life
was
in
fact
mailed
to
chicago,
the
home
offices
of
bankers
life.
mr.
arnold
bauman
i
just
verified
my
own
recollection.
these
securities
were
not
sold,
the
$4,853,000.00
worth
of
manhattan
bonds
were
not
sold
on
the
stock
exchange.
mr.
arnold
bauman
your
honor
--
does
your
honor
mean
mr.
north,
the
sec's
representative?
mr.
arnold
bauman
my
position
your
honor
is
this.
there
were
two
securities
transactions
in
the
connection
with
either
one
of
them
this
court
--
federal
jurisdiction
was
properly
invoked.
in
the
first
instance,
you
had
the
sale
of
manhattan's
security,
i
beg
your
pardon,
the
sale
of
the
stock
of
manhattan
from
bankers
life
to
bowlin,
bourne
and
begole.
that's
securities
transaction
number
one
and
under
section
10,
does
not
have
to
involve
listed
securities.
mr.
arnold
bauman
well,
in
connection
with
jurisdiction
as
i
say,
although
it
does
not
appear
as
an
issue
here,
i
will
respect
--
mr.
arnold
bauman
exactly,
in
payment
of
those
very
securities
by
the
way.
now,
--
mr.
arnold
bauman
yes
sir.
mr.
arnold
bauman
well,
there
is
a
man
in
this
case
whose
name
is
garvin,
and
mr.
garvin
was
a
note
broker
and
dealt,
a
member
of
the
firm
of
garvin
bentel
also
a
defendant
and
apparently
a
large
dealer
in
certificates
of
deposit
and
basically
a
note
broker
and
a
stock
broker.
in
some
manner,
bourne
and
begole,
now
bourne
was
a
similar
fellow
from
boston,
bourne
got
together
with
garvin
and
we
contend,
superintendent
of
insurance
contend
that
garvin
arranged,
indeed
it
is
absolutely
provable
that
garvin
arranged
with
irving
trust
to
show
up
at
the
closing
of
the
manhattan
stock
with
a
check
for
five
million
dollars
and
garvin
was
--
mr.
arnold
bauman
sir,
and
garvin
likewise
arranged
the
afternoon
transactions
which
as
i
will
come
to
in
a
moment
were
designed
to
cover-up
what
had
happened
in
the
morning.
now,
i
started
to
respond
to
mr.
justice
white's
question
if
i
might,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
should
like
to
come
back
to
that.
i
have
indicated
to
the
court
that
the
superintendent
of
insurance
contends
that
there
are
two
securities
transactions
here
and
we
rely
as
a
matter
of
fact
on
both
of
them.
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
when
it
said
that
we
will
not
reach
the
question
in
connection
with
the
sale
of
the
manhattan
securities
as
to
whether
or
not
this
is
in
connection
with,
because
as
to
those
securities
you
not
being
either
a
buyer
nor
a
seller
do
not
have
standing.
so
as
to
that
transaction
they
never
did
get
to
the
question,
although
i
might
point
out
that
judge
hayes,
who
dissented
in
the
court
of
appeals,
dissented
without
talking
about
standing
but
simply
said
“these
transactions
were
obviously
at
the
core
of
a
fraud
and
i
dissent.”
as
to
the
sale
of
the
government
securities,
the
court
of
appeals
fragmented
the
fact
situation
here,
did
not
look
at
the
actual
fraud
but
said
as
i
indicated
to
the
court
before
that
since
the
stock
transaction
itself
was
pure,
since
value
was
received
by
the
company
and
true
value
for
these
government
bonds,
all
you
have
here
is
a
misappropriation
of
proceeds
of
the
sale.
it's
corporate
mismanagement,
it's
corporate
waste
and
we
do
not
feel
that
is
appropriate
under
10
(b),
under
rule
10
(b)
(5).
so,
it
is
in
connection
with
those
two
transactions
that
i
press
upon
the
court
the
view
that,
and
i
will
come
to
this
a
little
later,
that
birnbaum,
which
is
a
principal
case
on
the
question
of
the
buyer-seller
status
under
rule
10
(b)
(5),
it
being
a
second
circuit
case
in
which
justice
hahn
wrote
the
opinion
many
years
ago,
i
shall
urge
upon
the
court
that
in
connection
with
rule
10
(b)
(5)
that
the
limitation
of
the
buyer-seller
rule
of
birnbaum
is
a
--
is
an
artificial
limitation
and
while
i
would
understand
that
an
expansion
of
it
might
somewhat
increase
federal
litigation,
i
respectfully
suggest
that
speaking
only
as
a
representative
of
creditors
that
whether
or
not
the
court
wishes
to
extend
10
(b)
(5)
beyond
buyer
and
seller,
i
respectfully
suggest
that
there
should
be
a
third
category
beyond
buyer
and
seller,
namely
that
a
representative
of
creditors,
because
certainly
when
one
talks
about,
making
regulations
in
the
public
interest
or
in
the
interest
of
investors,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
congress
had
to
be
talking
about
creditors
and
the
representatives
of
creditors.
indeed
in
the
brief,
we
cite
the
cases,
most
recent
one
of
which
is
bails
(ph)
and
going
back
to
hooper
which
is
a
landmark
case
of
the
fifth
circuit,
which
has
dealt
with
this
problem
over
and
over
and
over
again
and
i
respectfully
suggest
that
a
reading
of
those
cases
will
show
that
it
has
consistently
permitted
a
representative
of
creditors,
a
trustee
in
bankruptcy,
a
receiver,
a
person
like
the
liquidator
who
presumably
does
precisely
the
same
thing
as
those
gentlemen
do,
except
that
because
it
is
an
insurance
company
it
is
covered
by
state
law,
and
so
i
would
suggest
that
birnbaum
should
be
extended
to
include
such
a
person
in
the
interest
of
the
creditors
which
i
suggest
are
in
the
interest
--
mr.
arnold
bauman
i
would
--
i
--
mr.
arnold
bauman
yes.
mr.
arnold
bauman
that
is
precisely
--
mr.
arnold
bauman
that
is
precisely
what
i
am
suggesting
and
i
suggest
that
because
when
a
person
is
designated
in
such
a
capacity,
being
a
superintendent,
a
liquidator,
a
receiver
or
whatever,
he
is
there,
his
interests
are
varied
and
many.
his
interest
are
to
see
that
the,
that
all
creditors,
all
people
involved
with
the
corporation,
that
the
corporation
discharges
its
obligations
to
any
and
all
people
to
whom
it
owes
obligations.
mr.
arnold
bauman
the
creditors
manhattan
at
the
present
time,
your
honor
are
mostly
policy
holders,
people
with
claims
against
manhattan.
mr.
arnold
bauman
well
the,
there
is
the
(voice
overlap),
they
are
the
public,
there
are
the
insured
public.
mr.
arnold
bauman
there
is
a
reference
in
the
reply
brief
to
that,
a
short
reference
in
the
reply
brief
to
the
fact
that
there
are
claims
outstanding
and
as
damages,
if
we
ever
get
to
the
trial
that
we
will
prove
those
damages
at
the
trial
and
they
will
be
among
other
things
the
claims
of
the
creditors
sir.
now,
i
want
to
come
back,
if
i
may
to
the
events
of
that
january
24th
afternoon
and
because
we
are
now
at
the
situation
where
through
a
fraudulently
induced
representation
of
the
board,
the
board
has
authorized
the
sale
of
manhattan's
government
securities.
they
have
now
been
sold.
the
proceeds
have
been
put
into
the
irving
trust
company
which
issued
the
first
five
million
dollar
check
and
in
addition
manhattan
sends
over
enough
money
i
think
it's
$150,000.00
in
cash
to
cover
the
difference
between
$4,854,000
and
five
--
mr.
arnold
bauman
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
arnold
bauman
yes
sir,
and
so
now
irving
has
been
fully
repaid
for
the
five
million
dollar
check,
it
is
whole.
however,
at
this
point
in
time
may
it
please
the
court,
manhattan
has
minus
five
million
dollars
and
is
very
near,
if
not
actually
insolvent
in
a
regulated
industry,
i
have
one
in
which
the
insurance,
the
superintendent
of
insurance
regularly
visits
and
inspects.
so
in
order
to
make
this
scheme
good
one
had
to
come
up
with
the
scheme
to
create
a
paper
asset
which
would
take
the
place
on
the
manhattan
balance
sheet
of
the
five
million
dollars
which
the
corporation
have
been
looted.
now,
what
happened
there?
mr.
bourne,
i
beg
your
pardon,
mr.
garvin
then
arranged
an
afternoon
check,
most
of
these
transactions
i
have
told
you
about
until
now
occurred
in
the
morning.
in
the
afternoon
the
representative,
the
irving
trust
company
shows
up
at
belgian-american
bank
and
belgian-american
trust,
that
is
really
two
entities,
but
one
organization,
i
shall
refer
to
them
as
belgian-american
bank
and
this
representative
has
a
second
check
for
five
million
dollars.
whereupon,
belgian-american
trust
company
issues
a
certificate
of
deposit
in
the
name
of
manhattan
casualty
company
for
five
million
dollars.
this
is
endorsed
by
the
conspirators
and
the
so
called
loan
is
arranged
with
belgian-american
bank
to
one
of
bourne's
companies
called
new
england
note
for
five
million
dollars.
the
belgian-american
trust
cd
which
was
paid
for
with
irving
trust
company
money
is
used
as
collateral
for
the
five
million
dollar
loan
to
new
england
note,
but
proceeds
of
the
so
called
new
england
note
loan
are
then
immediately
delivered
to
irving
trust's
representative
so
he
came
with
the
check
for
five
million
dollars
and
went
back
with
the
check
for
five
million
dollars
and
once
again
irving
trust
withhold.
now,
where
were
we
at,
at
that
point?
at
this
point
now,
the
manhattan
is
out
five
million
dollars.
it
carries
the
belgian
trust
certificate
of
deposit,
even
though
it
is
hypothecated
as
cash
on
its
balance
sheet.
mr.
arnold
bauman
does
not
reveal
hypothecation
in
any
way.
it
carries
that
five
million
dollars,
it's
penal
fraud
because
there
is
not
any
five
million
dollars.
mr.
arnold
bauman
fraud
on
manhattan
casualty.
mr.
arnold
bauman
the
people
who
were
defrauded
are
the
public
who
have
seven
figure
claims
against
this
corporation.
the
people
who
are
defrauded,
if
the
corporation
sir
is
an
entity
at
all,
if
the
corporation
is
an
entity
i
would
respectfully
suggest
to
you
that
because
it
showed
five
million
dollars
in
assets
it
did
not
have
on
its
balance
sheet,
it
is
perfectly
conceivable
to
me
that
people
relied
on
that
balance
sheet,
people
outside
the
company
and
those
are
the
people
we
are
talking
about
as
the
public,
the
people
who
wrote
policies,
the
people
who
have
claims
against
the
company
and
those
are
the
people
whom
i
am
concerned
here.
so
that
at
the
end
of
january
24th,
manhattan
was
out
five
million,
mr.
bourne
and
begole
had
the
stock
for
nothing
there
was
a
fraudulent
asset
on
the
books
and
as
time
went
on
irving
caused
–
mr.
arnold
bauman
well,
my
answer
to
you
sir
is
this.
it
is
my
contention
that
all
of
these
transactions
to
which
i
have
alluded
were
part
of
one
overall
scheme.
mr.
arnold
bauman
yes
sir,
that
is
right.
mr.
arnold
bauman
i
know
that
court
of
appeals
may
have
said
that
but
it
means
to
me
that
--
mr.
arnold
bauman
yes
sir.
mr.
arnold
bauman
yes
sir,
i
am.
mr.
arnold
bauman
then
i
am,
i
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
prepare
for
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
mr.
justice
white
and
members
of
the
court,
throughout
the
years
of
this
litigation
that
question
has
never
risen,
but
the
answer
is
perfectly
obvious
and
i
shall
give
it.
in
connection
with
the
sale
of
all
the
securities
there
were
innumerable
confirmations
sent
through
the
mails
in
connection
with
the
sale
of
the
$4,854,000.00
of
us
government
securities.
there
were
confirmation
sent
through
the
mail.
in
connection
with
the
sale
of
those
securities
there
were
telephone
calls
made,
using
instrumentalities
that
give
jurisdiction
pursuant
of
the
security
fraud.
well,
that
is
it
and
i
am
sorry
i
was
not
better
equipped
to
answer
your
honor's
question
before
luncheon
recess.
mr.
arnold
bauman
absolutely
right
sir.
i
want
to
use
my
remaining
time
also
perhaps
to
clear
up
an
earlier
answer
i
made
to
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
want
to
make
clear
to
the
court,
if
i
may
that
so
far
as
the
us
government
securities
are
concerned,
the
$4,854,000,
we
feel
that
we
have
met
every
single
element
of
10
(b)
(5)
and
we
think
that
the
elements
of
10
(b)
(5)
are
as
follows.
one,
that
the
board
of
directors
was
deceived.
two,
that
$4,800,000
worth
of
manhattan's
securities
was
sold
as
a
direct
result
of
that
deception.
three,
the
corporation
gave
up
five
million
dollars
in
securities
and
got
nothing.
now,
both
judge
herlings
in
the
district
court
and
that
i
believe
the
united
states
circuit
court
for
the
second
circuit
held
and
as
to
that
transaction
and
that
series
of
transactions
there
was
no
question
of
my
standing
to
sue
or
the
liquidator’s
standing
to
sue
because
manhattan
was
in
fact
the
seller
of
security.
it
was
in
connection
with
the
transaction
involving
the
sale
of
the
manhattan
shares
between
bankers
life
and
the
buyers
that
they
invoked
the
birnbaum
doctrine.
and
again,
i
want
to
say
that
the
fragmentation
of
this
one
overall
scheme
which
had
it
as
its
sole
purpose,
the
looting
of
the
company
of
five
million
dollars
without
the
sale
of
securities,
it
could
not
possibly
have
happened
is
where
i
thought
company
from
the
second
circuit.
mr.
arnold
bauman
yes.
mr.
arnold
bauman
well,
he
was
a
sole
stockholder.
he
elected
him,
yes.
but
when
the
court
says
--
mr.
arnold
bauman
well,
mr.
justice
stewart,
it
seems
to
me
that
while
he
may
be
elected
by
the
stockholders
he
has
certain
public
responsibilities
as
well
as
indeed
if
he
has
many
to
the
person
who
elected
him.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
penal
statutes,
i
beg,
i
withdraw
the
word
penal,
there
are
statutes
which
impose
responsibility,
financial
responsibility
for
acts
of
directors
beyond
his
obligations
to
the
person
or
persons
who
elected
him.
i
do
say
that,
point
i
do
want
to
stress
again
is
that
if
the
corporate
entity
has
any
meaning
at
all,
it
has
got
to
be
separate
on
the
pod
from
both
its
stockholders
and
directors
and
whereas
here,
a
liquidator
or
receiver
stands
in
the
shoes
of
the
corporation
as
opposed
to
the
individual
who
may
own
the
corporation.
he
has
or
should
have
the
right
to
assert
public
claims
involved
in
the
responsibilities
of
the
corporation
to
the
public.
mr.
arnold
bauman
yes,
mr.
justice
white,
it
would
be.
yes.
mr.
arnold
bauman
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
mr.
arnold
bauman
the
public
who
would
have
relied
on
the
statement
of
manhattan’s
assets.
mr.
arnold
bauman
yes
sir,
but
i
do
hasten
to
assure
the
court
if
i
may
that
that
is
not
the
situation
in
this
case.
the
board
was
not
fully
in
on
this.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
board
was
deceived.
i
hope
the
court
will
forgive
me
for
emphasizing
that.
i
merely
attempted
to
reply
to
mr.
justice
white’s
question
which
is
argued
in
our
brief.
there
is
one
other
point
i
want
to
mention
quickly
because
i
notice
i
have
a
very
short
time
to
go
and
that
is
there
is
cited
and
relied
upon
by
my
adversaries,
case
of
field
against
lowe
(ph)
which
is
a
district
court
case
in
the
eastern
district
of
new
york
written
by
judge
zwack.
that
was
a
case
involving
a
common
law
conversion.
it
was
a
case
in
which
because
it
was
a
common
law
conversion
and
their
sole
stockholder
was
the
one
who
caused
it,
judge
zwack
felt
that
he
had
ratified
the
fraud
and
therefore
there
was
no
cause
of
action.
i
merely
want
to
specify
that
that
case
which
is
relied
upon
by
my
adversaries
differs
so
strongly
from
this
fact
situation
because
one
thing
is,
that
case
dealt
with
the
state
common
law
of
conversion.
it
did
not
attempt
to
interpret
10
(b)
(5)
and
there
were
no
allegations
of
deceit
on
the
board
of
directors
of
that
corporation.
the
factual
situation
is
entirely
different.
it
is
not
based
on
the
statute
that
we
are
here
to
discuss
and
indeed
i
respectfully
refer
the
court
to
the
opinion
in
bails
in
the
fifth
circuit
which
is
cited
in
the
brief
and
which
comes
out
exactly
on
the
opposite
side
of
this
question
of
does
knowledge
by
all
the
stockholders
constitute
ratification.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
arnold
bauman
yes
sir.
may
i
recommit
one
sentence
in
addition
to
that?
mr.
arnold
bauman
the
mere
fact,
and
this
is
dealt
within
the
brief
mr.
justice
blackmun,
is
if
in
fact
there
is
a
state
remedy
that
as
we
cited
and
discussed
in
the
brief,
does
not
oust
us
of
federal
jurisdiction
if
in
fact
we
do
fall
within
the
section
10
(b)
and
rule
10
(b)
(5).
in
other
words,
your
honor
will
find
in
the
cases
particularly
in
the
fifth
circuit
the
repeated
statement
and
other
statements
at
the
fact
to
that
there
may
exist
a
state
remedy
in
no
ways
affects
the
federal
remedy.
mr.
arnold
bauman
i
think
perhaps
i
should
have
in
luncheon
recess,
your
honor.
mr.
arnold
bauman
at
least
i
have
attempted
to
and
--
mr.
arnold
bauman
if
there
is
an
outstanding
question,
i
will
happy
to
try
to
answer.
mr.
arnold
bauman
thank
you
sir.
mr.
arnold
bauman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
appears
in
this
court
as
a
result
of
a
grant
of
certiorari
to
review
the
affirmance
of
judgments
by
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
affirmed
a
motion
of
the
district
court,
dismissing
the
complaint
in
this
case,
on
the
basis
that
the
complaint
did
not
present
an
instance
of
federal
jurisdiction
under
rule
17
of
the
security
act
of
1933
or
rule
10
and,
i
beg
your
pardon,
section
10
and
rule
10
(b)
5
of
the
security
act
of
1934.
as
i
am
certain,
the
court
is
aware,
i
shall
say,
merely
very
briefly
that
section
17
(a)
of
the
1933
act
deals
with
the
usage
of
interstate
facilities
of
interstate
commerce
in
connection
with
the
stock
frauds
involved
in
the
purchase
of
securities.
section
10
(b)
which
is
reproduced
at
page
3
of
our
brief
as
well
as
rule
10
(b)
(5)
was
later
passed,
a
year
later,
and
i
respectfully
urge
upon
the
court
that
it
was
passed
to
cover
the
loopholes,
to
make
up
for
the
loopholes
which
congress
left
when
it
passed
section
17
(a)
of
the
1933
act.
now,
i
should
like
merely
to
refer
to
one
part
of
section
10
(b)
because
it
is
at
the
crux
and
at
the
center
of
the
argument
that
i
intend
to
make.
section
10
of
course
states
that
“it
shall
be
unlawful
for
anyone
by
use
of
means
of
interstate
commerce
to
use
or
employ
any
deceptive
device,”
and
of
course
i
am
leaving
up
irrelevant
words,
“in
contravention
of
such
rules
and
regulations
as
the
commission
may
prescribe
as
necessary
or
appropriate
in
the
public
interest
or,”
or
and
i
shall
come
to
the
reason
for
that
emphasis,
“for
the
protection
of
investors.”
i
think
i
can
say
now
before
i
discuss
the
facts
with
the
court
that
the
reason
i
stressed
the
“or”
in
rule
10
(b)
(5)
is
because
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
court
below,
both
courts
below,
judge
herlings
(ph)
in
the
district
court
and
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit,
both
tended
to
read
the
protection,
the
words
“in
the
public
interest”
as
synonymous
with
the
“protection
of
investors.”
and
i
respectfully
submit
to
this
court
that
when
rule
was
promulgated,
the
exchange
had
in
mind,
i
beg
your
pardon,
when
that
section
was
passed,
the
congress
had
in
mind
a
different
test
for
that
which
is
alleged
to
have
been
in
the
public
interest
from
that
which
is
necessary
for
the
protection
of
investors.
mr.
arnold
bauman
yes
sir?
mr.
arnold
bauman
your
honor,
i
was
just
this
moment
coming
to
that.
i
was
about
to
say
that
rule
10
(b)
(5)
presents
or
gives
rise
to
the
second
or
another
one
of
the
issues
in
this
case,
in
that
it
in
effect
paraphrases
section
17
(a),
but
then
adds
as
mr.
justice
brennan
has
called
to
my
attention,
in
his
very
last
words,
that
it
prohibits
unlawful
actions
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
any
security.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
should
like
to
use
part
of
my
time
to
discuss
the
facts
with
the
court
because
i
think
they
are
very
important
in
this
case,
but
in
order
to
put
it
in
focus,
i
would
like
to
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
felt
that
where
a
securities
transaction
is
pure
in
itself,
in
other
words,
securities
worth
x
dollars
are
sold
for
x
dollars,
even
though
that
is
part
of
an
--
and
an
integral
part,
indeed
a
--
an
absolutely
necessary
part
of
an
overall
fraudulent
scheme
to
fact
that
neither
the
securities
transaction
was
impure
nor
were
the
processes
of
a
marketplace,
solely
to
use
the
words
of
the
opinion
below,
that
in
such
a
case
as
long
as
the
--
as
the
securities
transaction
is
pure,
the
court
below
felt
that
it
was
not
“in
connection
with
a
securities
transaction.”
now,
with
the
court's
permission
i
should
like
to
address
myself
to
the
facts
of
this
case
because
as
i
say
in
my
view
they
are
--
they
are
that
important.
i
should
say
at
the
very
first
that
i
appear
as
a
representative
of
the
superintendent
of
insurances
of
the
state
of
new
york
who
as
a
result
of
the
transactions
which
i
am
about
to
relate
was
appointed
liquidator
of
manhattan
casualty
company,
a
new
york
insurance
company
and
of
course
the
liquidator
was
appointed
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
functions
under
an
order
of
such
appointment.
until
january
24,
1962,
bankers
life
was
the
sole
stockholder
of
manhattan
casualty
corporation.
on
that
day
bankers
sold
its
manhattan
stock
to
a
group
consisting
of
a
man
named
bourne
and
another
man
named
begole,
who
had
no
money
at
all
as
will
come
out
in
a
moment,
for
five
million
dollars.
it
had
previously
been
arranged
with
the
irving
trust
company
that
at
the
closing
of
this
manhattan
stock,
irving
would
appear
with
the
check
for
five
million
dollars
and
at
the
closing,
at
the
sale
from
bankers
life
to
bourne
and
begole,
a
representative,
an
officer
of
irving
trust
did
in
fact
appear
with
a
check
made
up
in
the
sum
of
five
million
dollars
payable
to
bankers
life.
this
was
delivered
at
the
--
at
the
closing.
i
should
point
out
that
in
this
point
of
time
and
indeed
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
until
after
the
close
of
business
on
january
24th,
1962,
manhattan
casualty
had
no
account
to
them,
nonetheless,
irving
did
issue
this
check
of
five
million
to
bankers
life
obviously
to
pay
for
the
stock
which
was
being
transferred.
shortly
after
the
closing
of
the
stock,
a
new
board
was
elected
and
the
board
convened.
mr.
arnold
bauman
yes
sir,
and
the
board
convened.
it
was
represented,
and
i
believe
the
record
best
indicates
that
it
was
represented
at
that
meeting
by
the
chairman
of
the
board,
new
board
of
manhattan,
the
man
begole
whom
i
previously
made
reference
as
a
purchaser
that
manhattan's
portfolio
of
government
securities,
us
government
bonds
and
securities
totaling
some
$4,854,000.00
was
an
undesirable
investment
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
corporation
and
recommended
to
the
board
of
directors
that
in
order
to
bet
at
the
corporate
position,
these
bonds
should
be
sold
and
the
money
invested
in
a
certificate
of
deposit.
the
board
of
directors,
believing
that
the
sale
of
its
portfolio
of
government
securities
totaling
almost
some
five
million
dollars
was
so
going
to
be
altered,
voted
a
resolution
relying
on
the
misrepresentations
of
the
chairman,
authorizing
the
sale
of
the
portfolio
of
manhattan's
government
funds.
they
were
rapidly
sold.
mr.
arnold
bauman
i
am
not
--
they
were
sold
to
the
second
district
securities
and
i
am
not
certain
whether
or
not
in
that
sale
an
instrumentality
of
the
stock
exchange
was
used,
i
do
not
believe
so
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
arnold
bauman
no
sir,
it
does
not.
under
section
10
in
rule
10
(b)
(5)
it
is
not
required
that
security
sold
be
either
listed
or
unlisted
or
--
mr.
arnold
bauman
i
think
the
reason
we
are
here
has
not
to
do
along
with
the
--
with
the
sale
of
those
securities,
but
the
fact
that
payment,
a
check
in
the
sum
of
five
million
dollars,
the
payment
to
bankers
life
was
in
fact
mailed
to
chicago,
the
home
offices
of
bankers
life.
mr.
arnold
bauman
i
just
verified
my
own
recollection.
these
securities
were
not
sold,
the
$4,853,000.00
worth
of
manhattan
bonds
were
not
sold
on
the
stock
exchange.
mr.
arnold
bauman
your
honor
--
does
your
honor
mean
mr.
north,
the
sec's
representative?
mr.
arnold
bauman
my
position
your
honor
is
this.
there
were
two
securities
transactions
in
the
connection
with
either
one
of
them
this
court
--
federal
jurisdiction
was
properly
invoked.
in
the
first
instance,
you
had
the
sale
of
manhattan's
security,
i
beg
your
pardon,
the
sale
of
the
stock
of
manhattan
from
bankers
life
to
bowlin,
bourne
and
begole.
that's
securities
transaction
number
one
and
under
section
10,
does
not
have
to
involve
listed
securities.
mr.
arnold
bauman
well,
in
connection
with
jurisdiction
as
i
say,
although
it
does
not
appear
as
an
issue
here,
i
will
respect
--
mr.
arnold
bauman
exactly,
in
payment
of
those
very
securities
by
the
way.
now,
--
mr.
arnold
bauman
yes
sir.
mr.
arnold
bauman
well,
there
is
a
man
in
this
case
whose
name
is
garvin,
and
mr.
garvin
was
a
note
broker
and
dealt,
a
member
of
the
firm
of
garvin
bentel
also
a
defendant
and
apparently
a
large
dealer
in
certificates
of
deposit
and
basically
a
note
broker
and
a
stock
broker.
in
some
manner,
bourne
and
begole,
now
bourne
was
a
similar
fellow
from
boston,
bourne
got
together
with
garvin
and
we
contend,
superintendent
of
insurance
contend
that
garvin
arranged,
indeed
it
is
absolutely
provable
that
garvin
arranged
with
irving
trust
to
show
up
at
the
closing
of
the
manhattan
stock
with
a
check
for
five
million
dollars
and
garvin
was
--
mr.
arnold
bauman
sir,
and
garvin
likewise
arranged
the
afternoon
transactions
which
as
i
will
come
to
in
a
moment
were
designed
to
cover-up
what
had
happened
in
the
morning.
now,
i
started
to
respond
to
mr.
justice
white's
question
if
i
might,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
should
like
to
come
back
to
that.
i
have
indicated
to
the
court
that
the
superintendent
of
insurance
contends
that
there
are
two
securities
transactions
here
and
we
rely
as
a
matter
of
fact
on
both
of
them.
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
when
it
said
that
we
will
not
reach
the
question
in
connection
with
the
sale
of
the
manhattan
securities
as
to
whether
or
not
this
is
in
connection
with,
because
as
to
those
securities
you
not
being
either
a
buyer
nor
a
seller
do
not
have
standing.
so
as
to
that
transaction
they
never
did
get
to
the
question,
although
i
might
point
out
that
judge
hayes,
who
dissented
in
the
court
of
appeals,
dissented
without
talking
about
standing
but
simply
said
“these
transactions
were
obviously
at
the
core
of
a
fraud
and
i
dissent.”
as
to
the
sale
of
the
government
securities,
the
court
of
appeals
fragmented
the
fact
situation
here,
did
not
look
at
the
actual
fraud
but
said
as
i
indicated
to
the
court
before
that
since
the
stock
transaction
itself
was
pure,
since
value
was
received
by
the
company
and
true
value
for
these
government
bonds,
all
you
have
here
is
a
misappropriation
of
proceeds
of
the
sale.
it's
corporate
mismanagement,
it's
corporate
waste
and
we
do
not
feel
that
is
appropriate
under
10
(b),
under
rule
10
(b)
(5).
so,
it
is
in
connection
with
those
two
transactions
that
i
press
upon
the
court
the
view
that,
and
i
will
come
to
this
a
little
later,
that
birnbaum,
which
is
a
principal
case
on
the
question
of
the
buyer-seller
status
under
rule
10
(b)
(5),
it
being
a
second
circuit
case
in
which
justice
hahn
wrote
the
opinion
many
years
ago,
i
shall
urge
upon
the
court
that
in
connection
with
rule
10
(b)
(5)
that
the
limitation
of
the
buyer-seller
rule
of
birnbaum
is
a
--
is
an
artificial
limitation
and
while
i
would
understand
that
an
expansion
of
it
might
somewhat
increase
federal
litigation,
i
respectfully
suggest
that
speaking
only
as
a
representative
of
creditors
that
whether
or
not
the
court
wishes
to
extend
10
(b)
(5)
beyond
buyer
and
seller,
i
respectfully
suggest
that
there
should
be
a
third
category
beyond
buyer
and
seller,
namely
that
a
representative
of
creditors,
because
certainly
when
one
talks
about,
making
regulations
in
the
public
interest
or
in
the
interest
of
investors,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
congress
had
to
be
talking
about
creditors
and
the
representatives
of
creditors.
indeed
in
the
brief,
we
cite
the
cases,
most
recent
one
of
which
is
bails
(ph)
and
going
back
to
hooper
which
is
a
landmark
case
of
the
fifth
circuit,
which
has
dealt
with
this
problem
over
and
over
and
over
again
and
i
respectfully
suggest
that
a
reading
of
those
cases
will
show
that
it
has
consistently
permitted
a
representative
of
creditors,
a
trustee
in
bankruptcy,
a
receiver,
a
person
like
the
liquidator
who
presumably
does
precisely
the
same
thing
as
those
gentlemen
do,
except
that
because
it
is
an
insurance
company
it
is
covered
by
state
law,
and
so
i
would
suggest
that
birnbaum
should
be
extended
to
include
such
a
person
in
the
interest
of
the
creditors
which
i
suggest
are
in
the
interest
--
mr.
arnold
bauman
i
would
--
i
--
mr.
arnold
bauman
yes.
mr.
arnold
bauman
that
is
precisely
--
mr.
arnold
bauman
that
is
precisely
what
i
am
suggesting
and
i
suggest
that
because
when
a
person
is
designated
in
such
a
capacity,
being
a
superintendent,
a
liquidator,
a
receiver
or
whatever,
he
is
there,
his
interests
are
varied
and
many.
his
interest
are
to
see
that
the,
that
all
creditors,
all
people
involved
with
the
corporation,
that
the
corporation
discharges
its
obligations
to
any
and
all
people
to
whom
it
owes
obligations.
mr.
arnold
bauman
the
creditors
manhattan
at
the
present
time,
your
honor
are
mostly
policy
holders,
people
with
claims
against
manhattan.
mr.
arnold
bauman
well
the,
there
is
the
(voice
overlap),
they
are
the
public,
there
are
the
insured
public.
mr.
arnold
bauman
there
is
a
reference
in
the
reply
brief
to
that,
a
short
reference
in
the
reply
brief
to
the
fact
that
there
are
claims
outstanding
and
as
damages,
if
we
ever
get
to
the
trial
that
we
will
prove
those
damages
at
the
trial
and
they
will
be
among
other
things
the
claims
of
the
creditors
sir.
now,
i
want
to
come
back,
if
i
may
to
the
events
of
that
january
24th
afternoon
and
because
we
are
now
at
the
situation
where
through
a
fraudulently
induced
representation
of
the
board,
the
board
has
authorized
the
sale
of
manhattan's
government
securities.
they
have
now
been
sold.
the
proceeds
have
been
put
into
the
irving
trust
company
which
issued
the
first
five
million
dollar
check
and
in
addition
manhattan
sends
over
enough
money
i
think
it's
$150,000.00
in
cash
to
cover
the
difference
between
$4,854,000
and
five
--
mr.
arnold
bauman
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
arnold
bauman
yes
sir,
and
so
now
irving
has
been
fully
repaid
for
the
five
million
dollar
check,
it
is
whole.
however,
at
this
point
in
time
may
it
please
the
court,
manhattan
has
minus
five
million
dollars
and
is
very
near,
if
not
actually
insolvent
in
a
regulated
industry,
i
have
one
in
which
the
insurance,
the
superintendent
of
insurance
regularly
visits
and
inspects.
so
in
order
to
make
this
scheme
good
one
had
to
come
up
with
the
scheme
to
create
a
paper
asset
which
would
take
the
place
on
the
manhattan
balance
sheet
of
the
five
million
dollars
which
the
corporation
have
been
looted.
now,
what
happened
there?
mr.
bourne,
i
beg
your
pardon,
mr.
garvin
then
arranged
an
afternoon
check,
most
of
these
transactions
i
have
told
you
about
until
now
occurred
in
the
morning.
in
the
afternoon
the
representative,
the
irving
trust
company
shows
up
at
belgian-american
bank
and
belgian-american
trust,
that
is
really
two
entities,
but
one
organization,
i
shall
refer
to
them
as
belgian-american
bank
and
this
representative
has
a
second
check
for
five
million
dollars.
whereupon,
belgian-american
trust
company
issues
a
certificate
of
deposit
in
the
name
of
manhattan
casualty
company
for
five
million
dollars.
this
is
endorsed
by
the
conspirators
and
the
so
called
loan
is
arranged
with
belgian-american
bank
to
one
of
bourne's
companies
called
new
england
note
for
five
million
dollars.
the
belgian-american
trust
cd
which
was
paid
for
with
irving
trust
company
money
is
used
as
collateral
for
the
five
million
dollar
loan
to
new
england
note,
but
proceeds
of
the
so
called
new
england
note
loan
are
then
immediately
delivered
to
irving
trust's
representative
so
he
came
with
the
check
for
five
million
dollars
and
went
back
with
the
check
for
five
million
dollars
and
once
again
irving
trust
withhold.
now,
where
were
we
at,
at
that
point?
at
this
point
now,
the
manhattan
is
out
five
million
dollars.
it
carries
the
belgian
trust
certificate
of
deposit,
even
though
it
is
hypothecated
as
cash
on
its
balance
sheet.
mr.
arnold
bauman
does
not
reveal
hypothecation
in
any
way.
it
carries
that
five
million
dollars,
it's
penal
fraud
because
there
is
not
any
five
million
dollars.
mr.
arnold
bauman
fraud
on
manhattan
casualty.
mr.
arnold
bauman
the
people
who
were
defrauded
are
the
public
who
have
seven
figure
claims
against
this
corporation.
the
people
who
are
defrauded,
if
the
corporation
sir
is
an
entity
at
all,
if
the
corporation
is
an
entity
i
would
respectfully
suggest
to
you
that
because
it
showed
five
million
dollars
in
assets
it
did
not
have
on
its
balance
sheet,
it
is
perfectly
conceivable
to
me
that
people
relied
on
that
balance
sheet,
people
outside
the
company
and
those
are
the
people
we
are
talking
about
as
the
public,
the
people
who
wrote
policies,
the
people
who
have
claims
against
the
company
and
those
are
the
people
whom
i
am
concerned
here.
so
that
at
the
end
of
january
24th,
manhattan
was
out
five
million,
mr.
bourne
and
begole
had
the
stock
for
nothing
there
was
a
fraudulent
asset
on
the
books
and
as
time
went
on
irving
caused
–
mr.
arnold
bauman
well,
my
answer
to
you
sir
is
this.
it
is
my
contention
that
all
of
these
transactions
to
which
i
have
alluded
were
part
of
one
overall
scheme.
mr.
arnold
bauman
yes
sir,
that
is
right.
mr.
arnold
bauman
i
know
that
court
of
appeals
may
have
said
that
but
it
means
to
me
that
--
mr.
arnold
bauman
yes
sir.
mr.
arnold
bauman
yes
sir,
i
am.
mr.
arnold
bauman
then
i
am,
i
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
prepare
for
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
mr.
justice
white
and
members
of
the
court,
throughout
the
years
of
this
litigation
that
question
has
never
risen,
but
the
answer
is
perfectly
obvious
and
i
shall
give
it.
in
connection
with
the
sale
of
all
the
securities
there
were
innumerable
confirmations
sent
through
the
mails
in
connection
with
the
sale
of
the
$4,854,000.00
of
us
government
securities.
there
were
confirmation
sent
through
the
mail.
in
connection
with
the
sale
of
those
securities
there
were
telephone
calls
made,
using
instrumentalities
that
give
jurisdiction
pursuant
of
the
security
fraud.
well,
that
is
it
and
i
am
sorry
i
was
not
better
equipped
to
answer
your
honor's
question
before
luncheon
recess.
mr.
arnold
bauman
absolutely
right
sir.
i
want
to
use
my
remaining
time
also
perhaps
to
clear
up
an
earlier
answer
i
made
to
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
want
to
make
clear
to
the
court,
if
i
may
that
so
far
as
the
us
government
securities
are
concerned,
the
$4,854,000,
we
feel
that
we
have
met
every
single
element
of
10
(b)
(5)
and
we
think
that
the
elements
of
10
(b)
(5)
are
as
follows.
one,
that
the
board
of
directors
was
deceived.
two,
that
$4,800,000
worth
of
manhattan's
securities
was
sold
as
a
direct
result
of
that
deception.
three,
the
corporation
gave
up
five
million
dollars
in
securities
and
got
nothing.
now,
both
judge
herlings
in
the
district
court
and
that
i
believe
the
united
states
circuit
court
for
the
second
circuit
held
and
as
to
that
transaction
and
that
series
of
transactions
there
was
no
question
of
my
standing
to
sue
or
the
liquidator’s
standing
to
sue
because
manhattan
was
in
fact
the
seller
of
security.
it
was
in
connection
with
the
transaction
involving
the
sale
of
the
manhattan
shares
between
bankers
life
and
the
buyers
that
they
invoked
the
birnbaum
doctrine.
and
again,
i
want
to
say
that
the
fragmentation
of
this
one
overall
scheme
which
had
it
as
its
sole
purpose,
the
looting
of
the
company
of
five
million
dollars
without
the
sale
of
securities,
it
could
not
possibly
have
happened
is
where
i
thought
company
from
the
second
circuit.
mr.
arnold
bauman
yes.
mr.
arnold
bauman
well,
he
was
a
sole
stockholder.
he
elected
him,
yes.
but
when
the
court
says
--
mr.
arnold
bauman
well,
mr.
justice
stewart,
it
seems
to
me
that
while
he
may
be
elected
by
the
stockholders
he
has
certain
public
responsibilities
as
well
as
indeed
if
he
has
many
to
the
person
who
elected
him.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
penal
statutes,
i
beg,
i
withdraw
the
word
penal,
there
are
statutes
which
impose
responsibility,
financial
responsibility
for
acts
of
directors
beyond
his
obligations
to
the
person
or
persons
who
elected
him.
i
do
say
that,
point
i
do
want
to
stress
again
is
that
if
the
corporate
entity
has
any
meaning
at
all,
it
has
got
to
be
separate
on
the
pod
from
both
its
stockholders
and
directors
and
whereas
here,
a
liquidator
or
receiver
stands
in
the
shoes
of
the
corporation
as
opposed
to
the
individual
who
may
own
the
corporation.
he
has
or
should
have
the
right
to
assert
public
claims
involved
in
the
responsibilities
of
the
corporation
to
the
public.
mr.
arnold
bauman
yes,
mr.
justice
white,
it
would
be.
yes.
mr.
arnold
bauman
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
mr.
arnold
bauman
the
public
who
would
have
relied
on
the
statement
of
manhattan’s
assets.
mr.
arnold
bauman
yes
sir,
but
i
do
hasten
to
assure
the
court
if
i
may
that
that
is
not
the
situation
in
this
case.
the
board
was
not
fully
in
on
this.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
board
was
deceived.
i
hope
the
court
will
forgive
me
for
emphasizing
that.
i
merely
attempted
to
reply
to
mr.
justice
white’s
question
which
is
argued
in
our
brief.
there
is
one
other
point
i
want
to
mention
quickly
because
i
notice
i
have
a
very
short
time
to
go
and
that
is
there
is
cited
and
relied
upon
by
my
adversaries,
case
of
field
against
lowe
(ph)
which
is
a
district
court
case
in
the
eastern
district
of
new
york
written
by
judge
zwack.
that
was
a
case
involving
a
common
law
conversion.
it
was
a
case
in
which
because
it
was
a
common
law
conversion
and
their
sole
stockholder
was
the
one
who
caused
it,
judge
zwack
felt
that
he
had
ratified
the
fraud
and
therefore
there
was
no
cause
of
action.
i
merely
want
to
specify
that
that
case
which
is
relied
upon
by
my
adversaries
differs
so
strongly
from
this
fact
situation
because
one
thing
is,
that
case
dealt
with
the
state
common
law
of
conversion.
it
did
not
attempt
to
interpret
10
(b)
(5)
and
there
were
no
allegations
of
deceit
on
the
board
of
directors
of
that
corporation.
the
factual
situation
is
entirely
different.
it
is
not
based
on
the
statute
that
we
are
here
to
discuss
and
indeed
i
respectfully
refer
the
court
to
the
opinion
in
bails
in
the
fifth
circuit
which
is
cited
in
the
brief
and
which
comes
out
exactly
on
the
opposite
side
of
this
question
of
does
knowledge
by
all
the
stockholders
constitute
ratification.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
arnold
bauman
yes
sir.
may
i
recommit
one
sentence
in
addition
to
that?
mr.
arnold
bauman
the
mere
fact,
and
this
is
dealt
within
the
brief
mr.
justice
blackmun,
is
if
in
fact
there
is
a
state
remedy
that
as
we
cited
and
discussed
in
the
brief,
does
not
oust
us
of
federal
jurisdiction
if
in
fact
we
do
fall
within
the
section
10
(b)
and
rule
10
(b)
(5).
in
other
words,
your
honor
will
find
in
the
cases
particularly
in
the
fifth
circuit
the
repeated
statement
and
other
statements
at
the
fact
to
that
there
may
exist
a
state
remedy
in
no
ways
affects
the
federal
remedy.
mr.
arnold
bauman
i
think
perhaps
i
should
have
in
luncheon
recess,
your
honor.
mr.
arnold
bauman
at
least
i
have
attempted
to
and
--
mr.
arnold
bauman
if
there
is
an
outstanding
question,
i
will
happy
to
try
to
answer.
mr.
arnold
bauman
thank
you
sir.
