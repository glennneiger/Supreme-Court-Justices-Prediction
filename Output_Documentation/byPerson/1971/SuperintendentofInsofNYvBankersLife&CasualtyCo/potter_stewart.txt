now,

what
creditors
are,

stewart
was
there
any
indication
in
any
of

stewart
well
upon

justice
potter
stewart
who
is
defrauded?
this
is
a
case,
it
seems
to
me
where
a
fellow
took
over
a
corporation
and
looted
it
and
he
was
the
sole
owner
and
so
who
was
defrauded?
justice
potter
stewart
the
board
of
directors
was
deceived
by
this
sole
stockholder?
justice
potter
stewart
who
--
directors
were
therefore
his
representatives
as
managing
the
company
that
he
fully
owns,
is
that
right?
justice

stewart
and

generally
represent
the

mr.
justice
white’s
hypothesis
that
the

and
the

had
all
had
full
knowledge
of
this
looting,
then
who
would
