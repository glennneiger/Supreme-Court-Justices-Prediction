the
attorney
general,
the
deputy
or
one
of
the
assistants
here
in
washington,
do
i
read
the
statute
correctly?
unknown
speaker
and
is
that
true
also
with
respect
to
subsection
3
of
6002
when
it
involves
questions
before
a
committee
of
all

unknown

well,
i
am
just
inquiring
as
to
the
scope
of
–-
unknown
speaker
ullmann.
unknown
speaker
ullman
case.
unknown
speaker
first
part
of
your
brief
deals
with
that
problem.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
address
myself
to
the
dissenting
opinion
as
you
may
remember.
unknown
speaker
but
nobody
except
for
justice
blackmun
agreed
with
it.
unknown
speaker
now
the
distinction
to
which
you
are
now
referring
is
the
distinction
between
what
use
and
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
what
about
spivak
mr.
solicitor
general?
unknown

well,
spivak
has
never
been
really
overruled
has
it?
unknown
speaker
has
not

unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor
general,
do
you
think
we
have
to
have
one
rule
about
use
immunity
in
all
situations?
it
seems
to
me
the
interest
may
differ
in
various
context,
for
example
it
was
clean
in
spivak
and
kline
and
(ph)
garide.
unknown
speaker
yes
i
do
no
think—
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
rule,
would
suggest
that
you
were
varying
the
rule
if
you
said
that
there
maybe
state
interest,
or
federal
interest
say
such
as
in
murphy
against
waterfront
which
might
justify
taking
a
risk
of
incrimination
and
in
another
context
it
would
not
be
justified.
unknown
speaker
there
has
a
state
interest
you
say
here
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
same
hazards
that
counsel
--
unknown
speaker
you
talked
about
a
presumption
and
i
missed
the
presumption
that
you
have
just
told
us
now
should
not
be
conclusive.
unknown
speaker
how
about
the—
unknown
speaker
we
were
cited
by
your
brother
on
the
other
side
to
the
california
case
or
the
court
said,
well
it
was
findable,
it
was
findable
by
the
prosecution
estrange
to
this
testimony,
do
you
think
that
would
be
enough
for
the
government
to
show?
unknown
speaker
i
am
not,
well
i
am
not
quoting
it
but
this,
it
was
susceptible
of
being
discovered
independently
of
the
--
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
have
the
case
in
mind
but
he
referred
to
some
california
decision—
unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor
general,
what
about
the
situation
that
one
of
the
counsel
in
one
of
the
previous
cases
indicated
where
the
government
does
compel
the
testimony
and
the
testimony
is
given
and
this
induces
the
prosecutor
not
to
use
the
testimony
except
to
launch
an
investigation
and
by
independent
means,
wholly
unrelated
to
the
testimony
except
by
the
fact
that
it
was
given
search
out
independently.
unknown
speaker
would
you
agree?
unknown
speaker
so
but
for,
you
would
put
on
a
but
for
test
in
the
sense
that
except
for
the
testimony
the
government
would
never
had
it?
unknown
speaker
but
by
your
hypothesis,
you
caught
him
red
handed.
unknown
speaker
so
to
understand
it.
unknown
speaker
at
that
point
mr.
solicitor
general,
there
is
no
court
supervision
however
over
the
granting
of
that
--
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
question
in
your
mind
that
this
statute
6002
would
govern
the
use
of
any
evidence
or
of
its
fruits
in
any
kind
of
a
state
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
now,
i
was
wondering
about
for
example
state
administrative
proceeding.
unknown
speaker
or
in
a
federal
administrative
proceeding.
unknown
speaker
well,
this
court
has
gone
further
--
as
you
said
with
the
outset
from
the
literal
words
of
the
amendment.
