mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
simple
and
not
in
dispute.
the
respondent
here
was
ordered
to
testify
under
pursuant
to
section
6002
of
title
xviii
of
the
united
states
code,
he
refused
to
do
so.
the
question
is
whether
his
sentence
were
contempt
for
failing
to
comply
with
that
order
can
be
sustained
consistently
with
the
fifth
amendment.
of
course,
the
language
of
the
fifth
amendment
is
familiar
to
all
of
us.
it
is
one
of
the
shortest
and
the
simplest
clauses
in
the
constitution
but
i
think
it
is
worthwhile
to
get
back
to
the
language.
i
do
not
suggest
for
a
moment
that
it
should
be
construed
literally.
on
the
other
hand
i
do
not
think
that
it
should
be
regarded
as
a
take
off
point
for
a
vast
expansion
which
has
sometimes
occurred.
but
the
language
is
that
no
person
shall
be
compelled
in
any
criminal
case
to
be
a
witness
against
himself.
and
the
language
of
section
6002
which
is
section
201
a
of
the
organized
crime
control
act
of
1970
is
that
though
the
witness
is
required
to
testify
under
that
statute,
no
testimony
or
other
information
compelled
under
the
order
or
any
information
directly
or
indirectly
derived
from
such
testimony
or
other
information
maybe
used
against
the
witness
in
any
criminal
case.
the
problem
arises
because
of
the
language
in
counselman
against
hitchcock,
80
years
ago.
the
case
it
seems
to
me
is
a
sort
of
jurisprudential
case
and
example
of
the
process
by
which
the
law
grows
and
develops
in
this
case,
after
rather
extended
delay.
we
now
know
that
there
are
at
least
three
measures
or
varieties
of
immunity,
not
two
as
we
long
assumed
in
support.
the
use
immunity,
which
was
involved
in
counselman
and
hitchcock
and
was
held
to
be
inadequate
and
invalid.
there
is
extended
use
immunity.
immunity
not
only
to
the
use
of
the
testimony
but
to
its
fruits
which
is
what
is
involved
here.
and
finally
there
is
transactional
immunity
giving
amnesty
or
pardon
with
respect
to
any
offense
covered
by
the
testimony
and
that
was
held
to
be
sufficient
in
brown
and
walker.
there
is
complete
agreement
as
to
the
invalidity
of
use
immunity
alone
and
as
to
the
validity
of
transactional
immunity.
the
problem
arises
and
is
presented
here
with
respect
to
the
validity
under
the
fifth
amendment
of
full
extended
use
immunity
applicable
not
only
to
the
evidence
given
but
also
to
the
fruits
of
such
evidence.
the
situation
that
seems
to
me
comes
within
the
examples
of
which
the
common
law
is
filled
which
are
dealt
with
in
by
dean
pound
in
his
work
on
jurisprudence,
volume
three
page
564
where
he
says
we
must
distinguish
subsequent
judicial
rejection
of
the
reasoning
by
which
the
result
was
reached
in
a
prior
case
and
substitution
of
different
reasoning
leading
to
the
same
result
from
a
changed
course
of
decision
and
he
concludes
it
cannot
be
insisted
upon
too
often
that
the
common
law
technique
does
not
make
the
language
authoritative,
much
less
a
binding
authority.
it
is
the
result
which
passes
into
law.
no
one
saw
the
distinction
between
use
immunity
and
what
i
will
call
extended
or
complete
use
immunity.
for
almost
75
years
after
counselman
against
hitchcock
was
decided.
i
thought
a
lot
about
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
some
17
years
ago.
but
i
did
not
see
the
distinction.
mr.
mayer’s
in
his
thought
provoking
book
called
'should
the
fifth
amendment
be
amended',
published
in
1959
did
not
see
it.
judge
friendly
in
his
lectures
on
reconsideration
of
the
fifth
amendment
published
several
years
ago
did
not
refer
to
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
use
immunity
alone
such
as
was
held
invalid
in
counselman
versus
hitchcock.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
in
immunity
against
the
use
of
the
evidence
and
all
of
its
fruits
construed
as
broadly
as
the
court
feels
it
should
be
construed.
the
fact
was
that
for
ordinary
purposes,
the
question
was
concealed
because
immediately
after
counselman
and
hitchcock
was
decided,
congress
picked
up
the
sweeping
the
language
which
mr.
justice
buchwald
has
used
in
a
part
of
his
opinion
there.
the
statute
which
congress
enacted
was
introduced
in
the
congress
12
days
after
counselman
against
hitchcock
was
decided.
and
congress
provided
full
transactional
immunity
in
nearly
every
case
where
it
required
the
testimony
be
given
in
one
case
where
it
gave
only
the
narrow
use
immunity,
the
court
did
held
that
that
was
invalid.
congress
did
this
because
it
thought
it
had
to
do
so.
it
was
only
many
years
later,
when
this
court
found
for
the
first
time
that
the
fifth
amendment
applied
in
terms
of
the
states.
in
1964
seven
and
a
half
years
ago,
the
question
rose
to
the
surface.
it
came
in
through
the
side
door
so
to
speak
because
congress
by
its
statutory
language
had
left
no
room
for
it
to
come
before
the
court
directly
in
a
federal
criminal
case.
now
the
case
to
which
i
refer
is
of
course
murphy
against
the
waterfront
commission
where
the
immunity
was
granted
by
a
bi-state
organization.
it
was
held
that
the
state
had
no
power
to
grant
immunity,
transactional
immunity
against
a
federal
prosecution
but
the
court
sustained
the
statute
by
holding
that
under
its
supervisory
power
or
in
some
other
way
it
did
not
wholly
clear
the
testimony
obtained
in
the
bi-state
proceeding
could
not
be
used
nor
could
its
fruits
be
used
in
a
federal
prosecution
and
that
that
complied
with
the
fifth
amendment.
the
issue
was
implicit
and
mr.
justice
goldberg’s
opinion
for
the
court
in
that
case
for
example,
378
u.s.
at
page
78
and
79,
justice
goldberg’s
statement
of
counselman
against
hitchcock
refers
several
times
and
only
to
use
and
its
fruits.
it
was
explicit
in
mr.
justice
white’s
concurring
opinion
and
in
the
courts
opinion,
the
opinion
of
justice
goldberg.
the
conclusion
was,
that
the
testimony
could
not
be
compelled
unless
the
compelled
testimony
and
its
fruits
cannot
be
used
in
any
manner
by
federal
officials
in
connection
with
a
criminal
prosecution
against
it
and
then
he
repeated
the
conclusion
that
the
federal
authorities
would
not
be
allowed
to
use
the
evidence
or
its
fruits
and
said
this
exclusionary
rule
of
permitting
the
states
to
secure
information
necessary
for
effective
law
enforcement
leaves
the
witness
and
the
federal
government
in
substantially
the
same
position
as
if
the
witness
had
claimed
his
privilege
in
the
absence
of
the
state
grant
of
immunity.
and
the
distinction
was
explicit
and
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
white
concurring
on
that
case
and
if
it
was
that
opinion
i
think
which
brought
it
well
out
into
the
open
and
got
a
lot
of
people
to
thinking
and
resulted
in
the
work
by
professor
dickson
of
george
washington
university
incidentally
he
has
filed
a
brief
in
the
zicarelli
case
on
behalf
of
the
national
district
attorneys
association
which
seems
to
me
as
an
excellent
brief
and
which
i
hope
will
be
considered
in
connection
with
this
case.
since
then,
the
court
has
several
times
given
intimations
that
extended
use
immunity
is
sufficient
in
gardner
against
broderick
for
example
in
392
u.s.,
the
court
said
answers
maybe
compelled
regardless
of
the
privilege
if
there
is
immunity
from
federal
and
state
use
of
the
compelled
testimony
for
its
fruits
in
connection
with
the
criminal
prosecution
against
the
person
testifying
and
more
recently
last
term
in
united
states
against
freed,
the
court
upheld
the
latest
version
of
the
firearm
statute
under
situation
which
i
think
analysis
will
show
can
be
supported
only
if
extended
use
immunity
is
adequate.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
spivak
was
the
case
of
a
lawyer,
how
far
that
is
affected
by
gardner
and
broderick,
i
am
not
sure.
gardner
and
broderick
says
that—
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
spivak?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
has
what?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
do
not
believe
it
has
been
overruled
except
that
mr.
justice
harlan
who
dissented
in
spivak
against
kline
(ph)
felt
it
possible
to
concur
and
gardner
and
broderick
because
he
thought
it
had
in
effect
removed
the
substance
of
spivak
against
kline
and
i
think
it
is
true
that
a
lawyer
cannot
be
disbarred
or
a
policeman
removed
because
he
claims
the
fifth
amendment
but
it
apparently
is
true
that
both
things
can
be
done
because
the
lawyer
declines
to
answer
questions
and
that
seems
to
me
to
be
a
fairly
thin
line.
thus
it
seems
to
us
that
the
court
has
at
least
twice
decided
that
extended
use
immunity
meets
the
requirements
of
the
fifth
amendment.
murphy
is
not
affected
by
the
fact
that
two
jurisdictions
were
involved
there,
there
were
two
jurisdictions
but
there
is
only
one
fifth
amendment
and
it
is
now
equally
applicable
throughout
the
united
states
in
all
tribunals,
federal
and
state.
if
extended
protection
against
use
of
evidence
and
its
fruits
is
sufficient
to
sustain
the
validity
of
a
state
statute,
it
is
sufficient
under
the
same
constitutional
provision
to
sustain
the
validity
of
a
federal
statute.
and
on
this
i
would
like
to
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
dissenting
opinion
of
judge
vandosen
in
the
catena
case
to
which
reference
has
been
made
449
u.s.
40,
judge
vandosen’s
opinion
begins
on
page
46
and
he
considers
it
in
some
detail,
the
question
of
the
--
449
u.s.,
folks
i
am
sorry,
federal
second
449
u.s.
is
little
added
in
history,
449
federal
second—
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
page
40
and
judge
vandosen’s
opinion
begins
on
page
46.
the
court
could
not
have
decided
murphy
as
it
did
unless
extended
use
immunity
meets
the
requirements
of
the
fifth
amendment
nor
could
it
have
decided
freed
as
it
did
unless
extended
use
immunity
meets
the
requirements
of
the
fifth
amendment,
those
cases
should
be
controlling
here.
now,
contrary
to
one
of
the
counsel
who
appeared
this
morning,
i
believe
that
counselman
against
hitchcock
was
rightly
decided,
we
do
not
ask
that
it
be
overruled
but
some
of
its
language
is
now
seen
to
have
been
too
sweeping
and
this
is
one
of
the
ways
in
which
the
law
develops
and
the
time
has
come
for
this
development
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
am
not
at
all
sure
mr.
justice
that
we
need
to
have
it
in
all
situations.
i
do
feel
fairly
sure
that
the
same
rules
whatever
they
are
should
be
applicable
both
with
respect
to
the
application
of
the
immunity
in
federal
courts
and
state
courts.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
do
not
find
any
distinction
on
the
two
state
basis.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i
certainly
would
not
contend
for
a
rigid
fixed
rule
of
any
kind.
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
any
distinction
on
that
basis
between
waterfront
and
this
case.
there
may
well
be
other
cases
such
as
the
discipline
of
lawyers
and
discharge
of
policeman
which
would
present
different
factors.
i
have
not
given
a
great
thought
to
them
and
do
not
now
see
any
particular
distinction
but
there
may
well
be,
i
do
think
that
this
situation
involving
the
seeking
of
the
evidence
of
a
witness
for
use
in
connection
with
criminal
matters
is
not
distinguishable
on
grounds
of
special
situations
from
murphy
against
the
waterfront.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
seems
to
me
to
be
exactly
the
same.
now
we
have
held
in
other
fields
where
the
court
has
made
sweeping
decisions
which
were
right
and
has
later
qualified
a
language,
the
one
that
first
occurred
to
me
had
to
do
with
taxation
of
stock
dividends
where
the
court
in
ison
and
macombers
said
that
the
stock
dividends
are
not
income
and
cannot
constitutionally
be
taxed.
congress
then
immediately
stepped
in
and
passed
the
statute
saying
stock
dividends
are
not
taxable
and
it
was
not
possible
to
raise
any
further
question
under
that
statute.
it
was
only
through
the
side
door
when
somebody
was
ingenious
enough
to
raise
a
question
with
respect
to
the
basis
of
stock
dividends
that
the
court
intimated
that
well
maybe
some
stock
dividends
are
taxable
and
in
the
coslan
case,
it
was
decided
some
stock
dividends
are
taxable
and
congress
has
now
passed
the
statute
much
as
it
did
here
providing
that
certain
stock
dividends
are
taxable.
we
have
a
long
standing
constitutional
problem
in
this
country
as
to
the
applicability
of
a
non
discriminatory
tax
on
the
income
from
state
municipal
bonds
that
cannot
be
raised
directly
before
this
court
but
for
the
time
being,
because
congress
has
enacted
that
such
interest
is
not
taxable
but
perhaps
it
may
come
up
someday
and
the
court
may
find
reasons
to
qualify
some
of
its
earlier
positions,
it
may
come
up
someday
for
example
if
congress
extends
the
tax
on
tax
preference
income.
now,
the
court
may
well
be
concerned
about
the
practical
effect
of
a
decision
along
the
lines
i
have
indicated.
we
do
not
want
to
widdle
away
on
basic
fifth
amendment
guarantees
impairing
it
in
its
important
function
but
that
does
not
mean
that
we
should
not
perfect
our
understanding
of
it
and
apply
it
now
in
a
way
which
leaves
its
essential
guarantees
in
full
effect,
wholly
unimpaired,
while
defining
its
limits
in
such
a
way
as
to
preserve
other
values
which
are
consistent
with
or
indeed
required
by
the
constitutions.
let
me
suggest
the
following
considerations.
as
to
evidence,
first
discovered
after
immunity
has
been
granted,
there
should
be
a
heavy
burden
on
the
government
to
show
that
any
such
evidence
is
not
the
fruit
of
a
lead
or
clue
resulting
from
or
uncovered
by
the
compelled
testimony.
this
should
not
be
a
conclusive
presumption
because
there
can
be
cases
where
the
government
can
demonstrate
that
such
evidence
was
independently
derived.
it
comes
in
the
mail
for
example,
the
day
after
the
testimony
was
given
and
it
has
been
post
marked
in
france
a
week
before.
the
government
can
show
there
that
the
evidence
it
has
was
not
a
result
of
the
compelled
testimony.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
simply
said
that
--
i
said
burden,
there
should
be
a
heavy
burden
on
the
government
to
show
that,
its
evidence
was
not
derived
directly
or
indirectly
from
the
compelled
evidence
but
i
said
i
thought
it
should
not
be
a
conclusive
presumption.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
government
ought
to
be
free
to
show
if
it
can,
that
it
derived
it
independently.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
if
it
i
am
sorry
mr.—
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
i
think
the
government
ought
to
show
that
it
did
discover
it
independently
and
that
it
was
not
led
into
it
or
induced
to
it
by—
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
neither
do
i.
it
will
be
rare,
i
think
that
the
government
will
want
to
use
or
should
be
able
to
use
evidence
which
first
came
to
its
attention
after
testimony
was
compelled
and
extended
use
immunity
was
granted.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
a
hard
question
but
i
think
if
it
can,
if
it
does
appear
that
the
investigation
was
the
consequence
of
the
evidence
being
given,
that
then
the
evidence
is
something
which
was
indirectly
derived
as
a
result
of
the
testimony
given.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
would
construe
directly
and
indirectly
quite
broadly
and
i
would
put
the
burden
on
the
government
with
respect
to
evidence
derived
after
the
testimony
is
given.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
almost
mr.
justice,
on
the
other
hand
i
hate
very
much
to
give
conclusions
about
purely
hypothetical
cases
knowing
full
well
the
practical
situations
can
arise
which
will
make
it
to
look
different.
but
i
am
perfectly
agree
to
say
that
i
think
there
should
be
a
heavy
burden
on
the
government
to
show
that
the
evidence
it
wants
to
use
was
not
directly
or
indirectly
derived
from
the
testimony.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.—
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
no
doubt
that
that
may
start
people
to
thinking
and
or
why
is
that
and
let
us
look
up
this
and
see
what
we
can
find
and
then
surprisingly
enough
they
do
find
something.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
prosecution
is
perfectly
valid.
on
the
other
hand,
once
you
have
given
immunity
under
a
statute
which
says
that
the
evidence
shall
not
be
used
directly
or
indirectly
in
the
prosecution
of
the
defendant,
i
think
there
is
a
heavy
burden
on
the
government
but
i
want
to
point
out.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
it
could
be.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
are
many
circumstances,
on
the
other
hand
here
we
have
a
statute
which
says
that
evidence
compelled
shall
not
be
used
directly
or
indirectly
against
the
accused
and
i
think
in
a
proper
construction
of
the
fifth
amendment,
that
that
should
be
given
a
broad
interpretation.
but
in
many
cases
the
evidence,
the
government
has
ample
evidence
before
the
extended
use
immunity
is
granted.
the
government’s
need
and
objective
is
not
to
get
evidence
against
this
defendant
but
rather
to
get
his
testimony
against
another
and
usually
more
important
defendant.
let
me
take
the
example
of
a
man
who
was
arrested
red
handed
driving
a
truck
filled
with
stolen
television.
they
have
got
finger
prints,
they
have
got
eye
witnesses
who
saw
every
stage
of
it.
they
have
got
his
signature
on
a
receipt
that
he
signed
for
the
goods.
there
is
no
any
question
about
their
having
sufficient
evidence
to
prosecute
him.
proposal
was
made
that
he
should
plead
guilty
and
testify
against
his
principles
and
the
hope
that
he
will
get
a
lighter
sentence
but
he
refused
it.
still,
they
want
to
get
testimony
against
the
big
operators.
it
is
his
testimony
maybe
essential,
that
the
ring
leaders
are
to
be
brought
to
justice.
as
things
were
before
1970,
his
testimony
could
be
had
only
at
the
price
of
giving
him
complete
amnesty
although
the
government
already
has
plenty
of
evidence
against
him.
indeed,
why
in
the
world
should
he
plead
guilty
and
hope
for
a
lighter
sentence
where
if
he
just
sits
back
and
knows
that
the
he
will
get
transactional
immunity.
he
could
not
testify
against
the
big
operator
without
disclosing
his
own
guilt
and
thus
he
could
sit
back
and
demand
complete
immunity,
another
aspect
of
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
you
are
giving
him
immunity
against
the
use
of
the
evidence
which
he
gives
and
its
fruits.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
by
my
hypothesis,
that
will
not
--
but
that
is
all
the
constitution
requires
is
that
he
not
be
required
to
testify
against
himself.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
you
are
not
going
to
use
any
of
this
testimony.
incidentally,
if
he
is
--
if
you
are
required
to
give
him
transactional
immunity,
he
can
simply
go
in
and
testify
and
say
yes
i
saw
a
murder
committed.
i
was
standing
there
and
refused
to
say
anything
more.
he
now
has
complete
immunity
against
prosecution
for
any
part
of
the
murder
because
that
was
a
transaction
as
to
which
he
testified.
with
respect
to
use
immunity,
he
will
get
immunity
only
with
respect
to
what
he
does
testify
and
thus
he
will
testify
much
more
widely
and
freely
under
use
immunity
and
than
under
transactional
immunity.
giving
him
extended
use
immunity,
leaves
him
no
worse
than
he
was
before.
it
does
not
require
that
he
be
put
in
a
better
position.
and
none
of
his
testimony
or
its
fruits
can
be
used
against
him
but
the
evidence
already
available
and
demonstrably
wholly
independent
of
the
testimony
he
gives
remains
available
and
can
be
used.
so
this
clearly
guilty
man
will
not
go
as
scot
free.
let
me
put
the
same
thing
in
another
way
because
this
has
a
relation
to
the
sixth
amendment
and
its
constitutionally
guaranteed
right,
the
defendant
shall
have
compulsory
process
of
witnesses.
suppose
you
are
prosecuting
a
and
b
and
b
says,
comes
to
the
district
attorney
and
says
i
want
to
use
a
as
a
witness
on
my
behalf
and
a
says
nothing
doing,
i
cannot
testify
without
showing
i
was
there
and
that
will
incriminate
me.
the
b
says
to
the
district
attorney,
we
will
give
him
immunity,
and
the
district
attorney
says
nothing
doing,
i
can
only
give
him
transactional
immunity,
i
am
not
going
to
let
him
off,
we
know
well
that
he
is
guilty.
but
if
the
district
attorney
can
give
him
use
immunity,
then
b
can
get
the
benefit
of
a’s
testimony
such
as
it
is
without
a
having
to
be
given
a
pardon
or
amnesty.
and
thus
there
seems
to
me
that
somewhat
as
in
the
simon’s
case
where
the
fifth
and
the
fourth
amendments
were
pressed
together.
we
have
here
a
way
in
which
the
allowance
of
use
immunity
under
the
fifth
amendment
will
help
to
support
the
compulsory
process
which
is
given
by
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice,
only
the
--
well
nobody
can
give
immunity
under
the
statute
except
with
the
approval
of
the
attorney
general,
the
deputy
attorney
general
or
a
designated
assistant
attorney
general.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
is
mr.
justice
there
is
no
court
supervision
and
i
do
not
think
there
should
be,
this
is
a
part
of
the
prosecutor's
judgment
but
very
narrowly
limited,
incidentally,
the
other
parts
of
the
statute
provide
that
with
respect
to
administrative
agencies,
the
attorney
general
has
an
absolute
veto,
they
cannot
do
it
unless
he
approves
with
respect
to
congressional
committees,
it
requires
a
majority
of
the
house
of
congress
or
two-thirds
of
a
committee
and
it
must
be
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
for
at
least
20
days.
he
does
not
have
a
veto
power.
now,
there
are
arguments
about
the
use
of
testimony
to
impeach
the
fact
that
the
evidence
might
conceivably
have
some
effect
on
cross
examination.
my
time
is
expired
but
i
would
suggest
that
there
are
problems
about
waiver
which
come
into
that.
if
the
defendant
has
chosen
to
testify,
he
may
not
have
as
much
protection
under
the
fifth
amendment
as
he
might
otherwise.
moreover,
with
respect
to
the
use
of
the
information
by
way
of
cross
examination,
he
will
have
counsel,
his
counsel
can
object
to
the
question
at
anytime.
and
if
the
court
finds
that
question
is
derived
indirectly
by
way
of
using
the
evidence
which
was
obtained
under
compulsion.
the
court
should
exclude
the
testimony
and
if
necessary
it
could
come
to
this
court
for
review.
we
think
that
the
court
has
already
established
that
what
i
have
found
extended
use
immunity
complies
with
fifth
amendment,
there
are
undoubtedly
peripheral
problems
that
will
have
to
be
considered
over
the
years,
but
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
we
think
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
mr.
justice,
of
course
i
am
representing
the
federal
government
and
state
officer
might
feel
differently,
but
i
think
under
some
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
supremacy
power,
if
the
federal
immunity
is
granted,
it
is
binding
on
the
states.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
to
the
full
extent.
some
of
the
old
statute
referred
to
in
any
court
and
this
statute
says
in
any
criminal
case,
now
that
could
be
construed
to
mean
only
in
a
federal
court,
i
do
not
think
it
should
be.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
think
it
only
applies
to
any
criminal
case.
i
think
it
could
perhaps
be
used
in
a
state
administrative
proceeding
or
in
a
civil
proceeding.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
or
federal
administrative
proceeding.
the
statute
only
protects
against
use
in
criminal
cases
and
that
is
all
the
constitution
protects
against.
no
person
shall
be
compelled
to
testify,
be
a
witness
against
himself
in
any
criminal
case.
that
is
all
the
constitution
says.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
simple
and
not
in
dispute.
the
respondent
here
was
ordered
to
testify
under
pursuant
to
section
6002
of
title
xviii
of
the
united
states
code,
he
refused
to
do
so.
the
question
is
whether
his
sentence
were
contempt
for
failing
to
comply
with
that
order
can
be
sustained
consistently
with
the
fifth
amendment.
of
course,
the
language
of
the
fifth
amendment
is
familiar
to
all
of
us.
it
is
one
of
the
shortest
and
the
simplest
clauses
in
the
constitution
but
i
think
it
is
worthwhile
to
get
back
to
the
language.
i
do
not
suggest
for
a
moment
that
it
should
be
construed
literally.
on
the
other
hand
i
do
not
think
that
it
should
be
regarded
as
a
take
off
point
for
a
vast
expansion
which
has
sometimes
occurred.
but
the
language
is
that
no
person
shall
be
compelled
in
any
criminal
case
to
be
a
witness
against
himself.
and
the
language
of
section
6002
which
is
section
201
a
of
the
organized
crime
control
act
of
1970
is
that
though
the
witness
is
required
to
testify
under
that
statute,
no
testimony
or
other
information
compelled
under
the
order
or
any
information
directly
or
indirectly
derived
from
such
testimony
or
other
information
maybe
used
against
the
witness
in
any
criminal
case.
the
problem
arises
because
of
the
language
in
counselman
against
hitchcock,
80
years
ago.
the
case
it
seems
to
me
is
a
sort
of
jurisprudential
case
and
example
of
the
process
by
which
the
law
grows
and
develops
in
this
case,
after
rather
extended
delay.
we
now
know
that
there
are
at
least
three
measures
or
varieties
of
immunity,
not
two
as
we
long
assumed
in
support.
the
use
immunity,
which
was
involved
in
counselman
and
hitchcock
and
was
held
to
be
inadequate
and
invalid.
there
is
extended
use
immunity.
immunity
not
only
to
the
use
of
the
testimony
but
to
its
fruits
which
is
what
is
involved
here.
and
finally
there
is
transactional
immunity
giving
amnesty
or
pardon
with
respect
to
any
offense
covered
by
the
testimony
and
that
was
held
to
be
sufficient
in
brown
and
walker.
there
is
complete
agreement
as
to
the
invalidity
of
use
immunity
alone
and
as
to
the
validity
of
transactional
immunity.
the
problem
arises
and
is
presented
here
with
respect
to
the
validity
under
the
fifth
amendment
of
full
extended
use
immunity
applicable
not
only
to
the
evidence
given
but
also
to
the
fruits
of
such
evidence.
the
situation
that
seems
to
me
comes
within
the
examples
of
which
the
common
law
is
filled
which
are
dealt
with
in
by
dean
pound
in
his
work
on
jurisprudence,
volume
three
page
564
where
he
says
we
must
distinguish
subsequent
judicial
rejection
of
the
reasoning
by
which
the
result
was
reached
in
a
prior
case
and
substitution
of
different
reasoning
leading
to
the
same
result
from
a
changed
course
of
decision
and
he
concludes
it
cannot
be
insisted
upon
too
often
that
the
common
law
technique
does
not
make
the
language
authoritative,
much
less
a
binding
authority.
it
is
the
result
which
passes
into
law.
no
one
saw
the
distinction
between
use
immunity
and
what
i
will
call
extended
or
complete
use
immunity.
for
almost
75
years
after
counselman
against
hitchcock
was
decided.
i
thought
a
lot
about
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
some
17
years
ago.
but
i
did
not
see
the
distinction.
mr.
mayer’s
in
his
thought
provoking
book
called
'should
the
fifth
amendment
be
amended',
published
in
1959
did
not
see
it.
judge
friendly
in
his
lectures
on
reconsideration
of
the
fifth
amendment
published
several
years
ago
did
not
refer
to
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
use
immunity
alone
such
as
was
held
invalid
in
counselman
versus
hitchcock.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
in
immunity
against
the
use
of
the
evidence
and
all
of
its
fruits
construed
as
broadly
as
the
court
feels
it
should
be
construed.
the
fact
was
that
for
ordinary
purposes,
the
question
was
concealed
because
immediately
after
counselman
and
hitchcock
was
decided,
congress
picked
up
the
sweeping
the
language
which
mr.
justice
buchwald
has
used
in
a
part
of
his
opinion
there.
the
statute
which
congress
enacted
was
introduced
in
the
congress
12
days
after
counselman
against
hitchcock
was
decided.
and
congress
provided
full
transactional
immunity
in
nearly
every
case
where
it
required
the
testimony
be
given
in
one
case
where
it
gave
only
the
narrow
use
immunity,
the
court
did
held
that
that
was
invalid.
congress
did
this
because
it
thought
it
had
to
do
so.
it
was
only
many
years
later,
when
this
court
found
for
the
first
time
that
the
fifth
amendment
applied
in
terms
of
the
states.
in
1964
seven
and
a
half
years
ago,
the
question
rose
to
the
surface.
it
came
in
through
the
side
door
so
to
speak
because
congress
by
its
statutory
language
had
left
no
room
for
it
to
come
before
the
court
directly
in
a
federal
criminal
case.
now
the
case
to
which
i
refer
is
of
course
murphy
against
the
waterfront
commission
where
the
immunity
was
granted
by
a
bi-state
organization.
it
was
held
that
the
state
had
no
power
to
grant
immunity,
transactional
immunity
against
a
federal
prosecution
but
the
court
sustained
the
statute
by
holding
that
under
its
supervisory
power
or
in
some
other
way
it
did
not
wholly
clear
the
testimony
obtained
in
the
bi-state
proceeding
could
not
be
used
nor
could
its
fruits
be
used
in
a
federal
prosecution
and
that
that
complied
with
the
fifth
amendment.
the
issue
was
implicit
and
mr.
justice
goldberg’s
opinion
for
the
court
in
that
case
for
example,
378
u.s.
at
page
78
and
79,
justice
goldberg’s
statement
of
counselman
against
hitchcock
refers
several
times
and
only
to
use
and
its
fruits.
it
was
explicit
in
mr.
justice
white’s
concurring
opinion
and
in
the
courts
opinion,
the
opinion
of
justice
goldberg.
the
conclusion
was,
that
the
testimony
could
not
be
compelled
unless
the
compelled
testimony
and
its
fruits
cannot
be
used
in
any
manner
by
federal
officials
in
connection
with
a
criminal
prosecution
against
it
and
then
he
repeated
the
conclusion
that
the
federal
authorities
would
not
be
allowed
to
use
the
evidence
or
its
fruits
and
said
this
exclusionary
rule
of
permitting
the
states
to
secure
information
necessary
for
effective
law
enforcement
leaves
the
witness
and
the
federal
government
in
substantially
the
same
position
as
if
the
witness
had
claimed
his
privilege
in
the
absence
of
the
state
grant
of
immunity.
and
the
distinction
was
explicit
and
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
white
concurring
on
that
case
and
if
it
was
that
opinion
i
think
which
brought
it
well
out
into
the
open
and
got
a
lot
of
people
to
thinking
and
resulted
in
the
work
by
professor
dickson
of
george
washington
university
incidentally
he
has
filed
a
brief
in
the
zicarelli
case
on
behalf
of
the
national
district
attorneys
association
which
seems
to
me
as
an
excellent
brief
and
which
i
hope
will
be
considered
in
connection
with
this
case.
since
then,
the
court
has
several
times
given
intimations
that
extended
use
immunity
is
sufficient
in
gardner
against
broderick
for
example
in
392
u.s.,
the
court
said
answers
maybe
compelled
regardless
of
the
privilege
if
there
is
immunity
from
federal
and
state
use
of
the
compelled
testimony
for
its
fruits
in
connection
with
the
criminal
prosecution
against
the
person
testifying
and
more
recently
last
term
in
united
states
against
freed,
the
court
upheld
the
latest
version
of
the
firearm
statute
under
situation
which
i
think
analysis
will
show
can
be
supported
only
if
extended
use
immunity
is
adequate.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
spivak
was
the
case
of
a
lawyer,
how
far
that
is
affected
by
gardner
and
broderick,
i
am
not
sure.
gardner
and
broderick
says
that—
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
spivak?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
has
what?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
do
not
believe
it
has
been
overruled
except
that
mr.
justice
harlan
who
dissented
in
spivak
against
kline
(ph)
felt
it
possible
to
concur
and
gardner
and
broderick
because
he
thought
it
had
in
effect
removed
the
substance
of
spivak
against
kline
and
i
think
it
is
true
that
a
lawyer
cannot
be
disbarred
or
a
policeman
removed
because
he
claims
the
fifth
amendment
but
it
apparently
is
true
that
both
things
can
be
done
because
the
lawyer
declines
to
answer
questions
and
that
seems
to
me
to
be
a
fairly
thin
line.
thus
it
seems
to
us
that
the
court
has
at
least
twice
decided
that
extended
use
immunity
meets
the
requirements
of
the
fifth
amendment.
murphy
is
not
affected
by
the
fact
that
two
jurisdictions
were
involved
there,
there
were
two
jurisdictions
but
there
is
only
one
fifth
amendment
and
it
is
now
equally
applicable
throughout
the
united
states
in
all
tribunals,
federal
and
state.
if
extended
protection
against
use
of
evidence
and
its
fruits
is
sufficient
to
sustain
the
validity
of
a
state
statute,
it
is
sufficient
under
the
same
constitutional
provision
to
sustain
the
validity
of
a
federal
statute.
and
on
this
i
would
like
to
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
dissenting
opinion
of
judge
vandosen
in
the
catena
case
to
which
reference
has
been
made
449
u.s.
40,
judge
vandosen’s
opinion
begins
on
page
46
and
he
considers
it
in
some
detail,
the
question
of
the
--
449
u.s.,
folks
i
am
sorry,
federal
second
449
u.s.
is
little
added
in
history,
449
federal
second—
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
page
40
and
judge
vandosen’s
opinion
begins
on
page
46.
the
court
could
not
have
decided
murphy
as
it
did
unless
extended
use
immunity
meets
the
requirements
of
the
fifth
amendment
nor
could
it
have
decided
freed
as
it
did
unless
extended
use
immunity
meets
the
requirements
of
the
fifth
amendment,
those
cases
should
be
controlling
here.
now,
contrary
to
one
of
the
counsel
who
appeared
this
morning,
i
believe
that
counselman
against
hitchcock
was
rightly
decided,
we
do
not
ask
that
it
be
overruled
but
some
of
its
language
is
now
seen
to
have
been
too
sweeping
and
this
is
one
of
the
ways
in
which
the
law
develops
and
the
time
has
come
for
this
development
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
am
not
at
all
sure
mr.
justice
that
we
need
to
have
it
in
all
situations.
i
do
feel
fairly
sure
that
the
same
rules
whatever
they
are
should
be
applicable
both
with
respect
to
the
application
of
the
immunity
in
federal
courts
and
state
courts.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
do
not
find
any
distinction
on
the
two
state
basis.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i
certainly
would
not
contend
for
a
rigid
fixed
rule
of
any
kind.
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
any
distinction
on
that
basis
between
waterfront
and
this
case.
there
may
well
be
other
cases
such
as
the
discipline
of
lawyers
and
discharge
of
policeman
which
would
present
different
factors.
i
have
not
given
a
great
thought
to
them
and
do
not
now
see
any
particular
distinction
but
there
may
well
be,
i
do
think
that
this
situation
involving
the
seeking
of
the
evidence
of
a
witness
for
use
in
connection
with
criminal
matters
is
not
distinguishable
on
grounds
of
special
situations
from
murphy
against
the
waterfront.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
seems
to
me
to
be
exactly
the
same.
now
we
have
held
in
other
fields
where
the
court
has
made
sweeping
decisions
which
were
right
and
has
later
qualified
a
language,
the
one
that
first
occurred
to
me
had
to
do
with
taxation
of
stock
dividends
where
the
court
in
ison
and
macombers
said
that
the
stock
dividends
are
not
income
and
cannot
constitutionally
be
taxed.
congress
then
immediately
stepped
in
and
passed
the
statute
saying
stock
dividends
are
not
taxable
and
it
was
not
possible
to
raise
any
further
question
under
that
statute.
it
was
only
through
the
side
door
when
somebody
was
ingenious
enough
to
raise
a
question
with
respect
to
the
basis
of
stock
dividends
that
the
court
intimated
that
well
maybe
some
stock
dividends
are
taxable
and
in
the
coslan
case,
it
was
decided
some
stock
dividends
are
taxable
and
congress
has
now
passed
the
statute
much
as
it
did
here
providing
that
certain
stock
dividends
are
taxable.
we
have
a
long
standing
constitutional
problem
in
this
country
as
to
the
applicability
of
a
non
discriminatory
tax
on
the
income
from
state
municipal
bonds
that
cannot
be
raised
directly
before
this
court
but
for
the
time
being,
because
congress
has
enacted
that
such
interest
is
not
taxable
but
perhaps
it
may
come
up
someday
and
the
court
may
find
reasons
to
qualify
some
of
its
earlier
positions,
it
may
come
up
someday
for
example
if
congress
extends
the
tax
on
tax
preference
income.
now,
the
court
may
well
be
concerned
about
the
practical
effect
of
a
decision
along
the
lines
i
have
indicated.
we
do
not
want
to
widdle
away
on
basic
fifth
amendment
guarantees
impairing
it
in
its
important
function
but
that
does
not
mean
that
we
should
not
perfect
our
understanding
of
it
and
apply
it
now
in
a
way
which
leaves
its
essential
guarantees
in
full
effect,
wholly
unimpaired,
while
defining
its
limits
in
such
a
way
as
to
preserve
other
values
which
are
consistent
with
or
indeed
required
by
the
constitutions.
let
me
suggest
the
following
considerations.
as
to
evidence,
first
discovered
after
immunity
has
been
granted,
there
should
be
a
heavy
burden
on
the
government
to
show
that
any
such
evidence
is
not
the
fruit
of
a
lead
or
clue
resulting
from
or
uncovered
by
the
compelled
testimony.
this
should
not
be
a
conclusive
presumption
because
there
can
be
cases
where
the
government
can
demonstrate
that
such
evidence
was
independently
derived.
it
comes
in
the
mail
for
example,
the
day
after
the
testimony
was
given
and
it
has
been
post
marked
in
france
a
week
before.
the
government
can
show
there
that
the
evidence
it
has
was
not
a
result
of
the
compelled
testimony.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
simply
said
that
--
i
said
burden,
there
should
be
a
heavy
burden
on
the
government
to
show
that,
its
evidence
was
not
derived
directly
or
indirectly
from
the
compelled
evidence
but
i
said
i
thought
it
should
not
be
a
conclusive
presumption.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
government
ought
to
be
free
to
show
if
it
can,
that
it
derived
it
independently.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
if
it
i
am
sorry
mr.—
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
i
think
the
government
ought
to
show
that
it
did
discover
it
independently
and
that
it
was
not
led
into
it
or
induced
to
it
by—
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
neither
do
i.
it
will
be
rare,
i
think
that
the
government
will
want
to
use
or
should
be
able
to
use
evidence
which
first
came
to
its
attention
after
testimony
was
compelled
and
extended
use
immunity
was
granted.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
a
hard
question
but
i
think
if
it
can,
if
it
does
appear
that
the
investigation
was
the
consequence
of
the
evidence
being
given,
that
then
the
evidence
is
something
which
was
indirectly
derived
as
a
result
of
the
testimony
given.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
would
construe
directly
and
indirectly
quite
broadly
and
i
would
put
the
burden
on
the
government
with
respect
to
evidence
derived
after
the
testimony
is
given.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
almost
mr.
justice,
on
the
other
hand
i
hate
very
much
to
give
conclusions
about
purely
hypothetical
cases
knowing
full
well
the
practical
situations
can
arise
which
will
make
it
to
look
different.
but
i
am
perfectly
agree
to
say
that
i
think
there
should
be
a
heavy
burden
on
the
government
to
show
that
the
evidence
it
wants
to
use
was
not
directly
or
indirectly
derived
from
the
testimony.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.—
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
no
doubt
that
that
may
start
people
to
thinking
and
or
why
is
that
and
let
us
look
up
this
and
see
what
we
can
find
and
then
surprisingly
enough
they
do
find
something.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
prosecution
is
perfectly
valid.
on
the
other
hand,
once
you
have
given
immunity
under
a
statute
which
says
that
the
evidence
shall
not
be
used
directly
or
indirectly
in
the
prosecution
of
the
defendant,
i
think
there
is
a
heavy
burden
on
the
government
but
i
want
to
point
out.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
it
could
be.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
are
many
circumstances,
on
the
other
hand
here
we
have
a
statute
which
says
that
evidence
compelled
shall
not
be
used
directly
or
indirectly
against
the
accused
and
i
think
in
a
proper
construction
of
the
fifth
amendment,
that
that
should
be
given
a
broad
interpretation.
but
in
many
cases
the
evidence,
the
government
has
ample
evidence
before
the
extended
use
immunity
is
granted.
the
government’s
need
and
objective
is
not
to
get
evidence
against
this
defendant
but
rather
to
get
his
testimony
against
another
and
usually
more
important
defendant.
let
me
take
the
example
of
a
man
who
was
arrested
red
handed
driving
a
truck
filled
with
stolen
television.
they
have
got
finger
prints,
they
have
got
eye
witnesses
who
saw
every
stage
of
it.
they
have
got
his
signature
on
a
receipt
that
he
signed
for
the
goods.
there
is
no
any
question
about
their
having
sufficient
evidence
to
prosecute
him.
proposal
was
made
that
he
should
plead
guilty
and
testify
against
his
principles
and
the
hope
that
he
will
get
a
lighter
sentence
but
he
refused
it.
still,
they
want
to
get
testimony
against
the
big
operators.
it
is
his
testimony
maybe
essential,
that
the
ring
leaders
are
to
be
brought
to
justice.
as
things
were
before
1970,
his
testimony
could
be
had
only
at
the
price
of
giving
him
complete
amnesty
although
the
government
already
has
plenty
of
evidence
against
him.
indeed,
why
in
the
world
should
he
plead
guilty
and
hope
for
a
lighter
sentence
where
if
he
just
sits
back
and
knows
that
the
he
will
get
transactional
immunity.
he
could
not
testify
against
the
big
operator
without
disclosing
his
own
guilt
and
thus
he
could
sit
back
and
demand
complete
immunity,
another
aspect
of
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
you
are
giving
him
immunity
against
the
use
of
the
evidence
which
he
gives
and
its
fruits.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
by
my
hypothesis,
that
will
not
--
but
that
is
all
the
constitution
requires
is
that
he
not
be
required
to
testify
against
himself.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
you
are
not
going
to
use
any
of
this
testimony.
incidentally,
if
he
is
--
if
you
are
required
to
give
him
transactional
immunity,
he
can
simply
go
in
and
testify
and
say
yes
i
saw
a
murder
committed.
i
was
standing
there
and
refused
to
say
anything
more.
he
now
has
complete
immunity
against
prosecution
for
any
part
of
the
murder
because
that
was
a
transaction
as
to
which
he
testified.
with
respect
to
use
immunity,
he
will
get
immunity
only
with
respect
to
what
he
does
testify
and
thus
he
will
testify
much
more
widely
and
freely
under
use
immunity
and
than
under
transactional
immunity.
giving
him
extended
use
immunity,
leaves
him
no
worse
than
he
was
before.
it
does
not
require
that
he
be
put
in
a
better
position.
and
none
of
his
testimony
or
its
fruits
can
be
used
against
him
but
the
evidence
already
available
and
demonstrably
wholly
independent
of
the
testimony
he
gives
remains
available
and
can
be
used.
so
this
clearly
guilty
man
will
not
go
as
scot
free.
let
me
put
the
same
thing
in
another
way
because
this
has
a
relation
to
the
sixth
amendment
and
its
constitutionally
guaranteed
right,
the
defendant
shall
have
compulsory
process
of
witnesses.
suppose
you
are
prosecuting
a
and
b
and
b
says,
comes
to
the
district
attorney
and
says
i
want
to
use
a
as
a
witness
on
my
behalf
and
a
says
nothing
doing,
i
cannot
testify
without
showing
i
was
there
and
that
will
incriminate
me.
the
b
says
to
the
district
attorney,
we
will
give
him
immunity,
and
the
district
attorney
says
nothing
doing,
i
can
only
give
him
transactional
immunity,
i
am
not
going
to
let
him
off,
we
know
well
that
he
is
guilty.
but
if
the
district
attorney
can
give
him
use
immunity,
then
b
can
get
the
benefit
of
a’s
testimony
such
as
it
is
without
a
having
to
be
given
a
pardon
or
amnesty.
and
thus
there
seems
to
me
that
somewhat
as
in
the
simon’s
case
where
the
fifth
and
the
fourth
amendments
were
pressed
together.
we
have
here
a
way
in
which
the
allowance
of
use
immunity
under
the
fifth
amendment
will
help
to
support
the
compulsory
process
which
is
given
by
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice,
only
the
--
well
nobody
can
give
immunity
under
the
statute
except
with
the
approval
of
the
attorney
general,
the
deputy
attorney
general
or
a
designated
assistant
attorney
general.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
is
mr.
justice
there
is
no
court
supervision
and
i
do
not
think
there
should
be,
this
is
a
part
of
the
prosecutor's
judgment
but
very
narrowly
limited,
incidentally,
the
other
parts
of
the
statute
provide
that
with
respect
to
administrative
agencies,
the
attorney
general
has
an
absolute
veto,
they
cannot
do
it
unless
he
approves
with
respect
to
congressional
committees,
it
requires
a
majority
of
the
house
of
congress
or
two-thirds
of
a
committee
and
it
must
be
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
for
at
least
20
days.
he
does
not
have
a
veto
power.
now,
there
are
arguments
about
the
use
of
testimony
to
impeach
the
fact
that
the
evidence
might
conceivably
have
some
effect
on
cross
examination.
my
time
is
expired
but
i
would
suggest
that
there
are
problems
about
waiver
which
come
into
that.
if
the
defendant
has
chosen
to
testify,
he
may
not
have
as
much
protection
under
the
fifth
amendment
as
he
might
otherwise.
moreover,
with
respect
to
the
use
of
the
information
by
way
of
cross
examination,
he
will
have
counsel,
his
counsel
can
object
to
the
question
at
anytime.
and
if
the
court
finds
that
question
is
derived
indirectly
by
way
of
using
the
evidence
which
was
obtained
under
compulsion.
the
court
should
exclude
the
testimony
and
if
necessary
it
could
come
to
this
court
for
review.
we
think
that
the
court
has
already
established
that
what
i
have
found
extended
use
immunity
complies
with
fifth
amendment,
there
are
undoubtedly
peripheral
problems
that
will
have
to
be
considered
over
the
years,
but
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
we
think
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
mr.
justice,
of
course
i
am
representing
the
federal
government
and
state
officer
might
feel
differently,
but
i
think
under
some
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
supremacy
power,
if
the
federal
immunity
is
granted,
it
is
binding
on
the
states.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
to
the
full
extent.
some
of
the
old
statute
referred
to
in
any
court
and
this
statute
says
in
any
criminal
case,
now
that
could
be
construed
to
mean
only
in
a
federal
court,
i
do
not
think
it
should
be.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
think
it
only
applies
to
any
criminal
case.
i
think
it
could
perhaps
be
used
in
a
state
administrative
proceeding
or
in
a
civil
proceeding.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
or
federal
administrative
proceeding.
the
statute
only
protects
against
use
in
criminal
cases
and
that
is
all
the
constitution
protects
against.
no
person
shall
be
compelled
to
testify,
be
a
witness
against
himself
in
any
criminal
case.
that
is
all
the
constitution
says.
