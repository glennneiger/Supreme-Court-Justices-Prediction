would
you
agree
that
as
a
practical
matter,
sometimes
the
government
state
or
federal

initiate
an
investigation
simply
because
a
particular
witness

a
particular
question
for
a
grand
jury
by
clamming
fifth

immunity.

sometimes
when
an
investigation
by
a

agency
is
triggered
by
the
mere
fact
that
someone

before
a
grand

before
he
ever
asks
a
question
is
it
